CHESTER

<EOS>
Joe
will
give
you
an
account
of
me
till
I
got
into
the
boat
;
after
which
the
rogues
made
a
new
bargain
,
and
forced
me
to
give
them
two
crowns
,
and
talked
as
if
we
should
not
be
able
to
overtake
any
ship
:
 
but
in
half
an
hour
we
got
to
the
yacht
;
for
the
ships
lay
by
[
to
]
wait
for
my
Lord
Lieutenant
's
steward
.
 
<EOS>
We
made
our
voyage
in
fifteen
hours
just
.
 
<EOS>
Last
night
I
came
to
this
town
,
and
shall
leave
it
,
I
believe
,
on
Monday
.
 
<EOS>
The
first
man
I
met
in
Chester
was
Dr.
Raymond
.
 
<EOS>
He
and
Mrs.
Raymond
were
here
about
levying
a
fine
,
in
order
to
have
power
to
sell
their
estate
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
found
everything
answer
very
well
.
 
<EOS>
They
both
desire
to
present
their
humble
services
to
you
:
they
do
not
think
of
Ireland
till
next
year
.
 
<EOS>
I
got
a
fall
off
my
horse
,
riding
here
from
Parkgate
,
but
no
hurt
;
the
horse
understanding
falls
very
well
,
and
lying
quietly
till
I
get
up
.
 
<EOS>
My
duty
to
the
Bishop
of
Clogher
.
<EOS>
I
saw
him
returning
from
Dunleary
;
but
he
saw
not
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
take
it
ill
<EOS>
he
was
not
at
Convocation
,
and
that
I
have
not
his
name
to
my
powers
.
 
<EOS>
I
beg
you
will
hold
your
resolution
of
going
to
Trim
,
and
riding
there
as
much
as
you
can
.
 
<EOS>
Let
the
Bishop
of
Clogher
remind
the
Bishop
of
Killala
to
send
me
a
letter
,
with
one
enclosed
to
the
Bishop
of
Lichfield
.
 
<EOS>
Let
all
who
write
to
me
,
enclose
to
Richard
Steele
,
Esq
.
,
at
his
office
at
the
Cockpit
,
near
Whitehall
.
 
<EOS>
But
not
MD
;
I
will
pay
for
their
letters
at
St.
James
's
Coffee-
house
,
that
I
may
have
them
the
sooner
.
 
<EOS>
My
Lord
Mountjoy
is
now
in
the
humour
that
we
should
begin
our
journey
this
afternoon
;
so
that
I
have
stole
here
again
to
finish
this
letter
,
which
must
be
short
or
long
accordingly
.
 
<EOS>
I
write
this
post
to
Mrs.
Wesley
,
and
will
tell
her
,
that
I
have
taken
care
<EOS>
she
may
have
her
bill
of
one
hundred
and
fifteen
pounds
whenever
she
pleases
to
send
for
it
;
and
in
that
case
I
desire
you
will
send
it
<EOS>
her
enclosed
and
sealed
,
and
have
it
ready
<EOS>
so
,
in
case
she
should
send
for
it
:
 
<EOS>
otherwise
keep
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
say
no
more
till
I
hear
whether
I
go
to
-
day
or
no
:
 
<EOS>
if
I
do
,
the
letter
is
almost
at
an
end
.
 
<EOS>
My
cozen
Abigail
is
grown
prodigiously
old
.
 
<EOS>
God
Almighty
bless
poo
dee
richar
MD
;
and
,
for
God
's
sake
,
be
merry
,
and
get
oo
health
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
perfectly
resolved
to
return
as
soon
as
I
have
done
my
commission
,
whether
it
succeeds
or
no
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
went
to
England
with
so
little
desire
in
my
life
.
 
<EOS>
If
Mrs.
Curry
makes
any
difficulty
about
the
lodgings
,
I
will
quit
them
and
pay
her
from
July
9
last
,
and
Mrs.
Brent
must
write
to
Parvisol
with
orders
accordingly
.
 
<EOS>
The
post
is
come
from
London
,
and
just
going
out
;
so
I
have
only
time
to
pray
God
to
bless
poor

LETTER

<EOS>
LONDON
,
Sept.
9
,
1710
.
  
<EOS>
Got
here
last
Thursday
,
after
five
days
'
travelling
,
weary
the
first
,
almost
dead
the
second
,
tolerable
the
third
,
and
well
enough
the
rest
;
and
am
now
glad
of
the
fatigue
,
which
has
served
for
exercise
;
and
I
am
at
present
well
enough
.
 
<EOS>
The
Whigs
were
ravished
to
see
me
,
and
would
lay
hold
on
me
as
a
twig
while
they
are
drowning
,
and
the
great
men
making
me
their
clumsy
apologies
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
But
my
Lord
Treasurer
received
me
with
a
great
deal
of
coldness
,
which
has
enraged
me
so
,
I
am
almost
vowing
revenge
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
yet
gone
half
my
circle
;
but
I
find
all
my
acquaintance
just
as
I
left
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
hear
my
Lady
Giffard
is
much
at
Court
,
and
Lady
Wharton
was
ridiculing
it
t'other
day
;
so
I
have
lost
a
friend
there
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
yet
seen
her
,
nor
intend
it
;
but
I
will
contrive
to
see
Stella
's
mother
some
other
way
.
 
<EOS>
I
writ
to
the
Bishop
of
Clogher
from
Chester
;
and
I
now
write
to
the
Archbishop
of
Dublin
.
 
<EOS>
Everything
is
turning
upside
down
;
every
Whig
in
great
office
will
,
to
a
man
,
be
infallibly
put
out
;
and
we
shall
have
such
a
winter
as
hath
not
been
seen
in
England
.
 
<EOS>
Everybody
asks
me
,
how
I
came
to
be
so
long
in
Ireland
,
as
naturally
as
if
here
were
my
being
;
but
no
soul
offers
to
make
it
so
:
 
and
I
protest
I
shall
return
to
Dublin
,
and
the
Canal
at
Laracor
,
with
more
satisfaction
than
ever
I
did
in
my
life
.
 
<EOS>
The
Tatler
expects
every
day
to
be
turned
out
of
his
employment
;
and
the
Duke
of
Ormond
,
they
say
,
will
be
Lieutenant
of
Ireland
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
you
are
now
peaceably
in
Presto
's
lodgings
;
but
I
resolve
to
turn
you
out
by
Christmas
;
in
which
time
I
shall
either
do
my
business
,
or
find
it
not
to
be
done
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
be
at
Trim
by
the
time
this
letter
comes
to
you
;
and
ride
little
Johnson
,
who
must
needs
be
now
in
good
case
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
begun
this
letter
unusually
,
on
the
post
-
night
,
and
have
already
written
to
the
Archbishop
;
and
can
not
lengthen
this
.
 
<EOS>
Henceforth
I
will
write
something
every
day
to
MD
,
and
make
it
a
sort
of
journal
;
and
when
it
is
full
,
I
will
send
it
,
whether
MD
writes
or
no
;
and
so
that
will
be
pretty
:
 
and
I
shall
always
be
in
conversation
with
MD
,
and
MD
with
Presto
.
<EOS>
Pray
make
Parvisol
pay
you
the
ten
pounds
immediately
;
so
I
ordered
him
.
 
<EOS>
They
tell
me
I
am
grown
fatter
,
and
look
better
;
and
,
on
Monday
,
Jervas
is
to
retouch
my
picture
.
 
<EOS>
I
thought
I
saw
Jack
Temple
and
his
wife
pass
by
me
to
-
day
in
their
coach
;
but
I
took
no
notice
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
glad
I
have
wholly
shaken
off
that
family
.
 
<EOS>
Tell
the
Provost
,
I
have
obeyed
his
commands
to
the
Duke
of
Ormond
;
or
let
it
alone
,
if
you
please
.
 
<EOS>
I
saw
Jemmy
Leigh
just
now
at
the
Coffee
-
house
,
who
asked
after
you
with
great
kindness
:
 
<EOS>
he
talks
of
going
in
a
fortnight
to
Ireland
.
 
<EOS>
My
service
to
the
Dean
,
and
Mrs.
Walls
,
and
her
Archdeacon
.
 
<EOS>
Will
Frankland
's
wife
is
near
bringing
to
-
bed
,
and
I
have
promised
to
christen
the
child
.
 
<EOS>
I
fancy
<EOS>
you
had
my
Chester
letter
the
Tuesday
after
I
writ
.
 
<EOS>
I
presented
Dr.
Raymond
to
Lord
Wharton
at
Chester
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
let
me
know
when
Joe
gets
his
money
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
near
ten
,
and
I
hate
to
send
by
the
bellman
.
 
<EOS>
MD
shall
have
a
longer
letter
in
a
week
,
but
I
send
this
only
to
tell
I
am
safe
in
London
;
and
so
farewell
,
etc
.

LETTER
3
.
 
<EOS>
LONDON
,
Sept.
9
,
1710
.
  
<EOS>
After
seeing
the
Duke
of
Ormond
,
dining
with
Dr.
Cockburn
,
passing
some
part
of
the
afternoon
with
Sir
Matthew
Dudley
and
Will
Frankland
,
the
rest
at
St.
 
James
's
Coffee
-
house
,
I
came
home
,
and
writ
to
the
Archbishop
of
Dublin
and
MD
,
and
am
going
to
bed
.
 
<EOS>
I
forgot
to
tell
you
,
that
I
begged
Will
Frankland
to
stand
Manley
's
friend
with
his
father
in
this
shaking
season
for
places
.
 
<EOS>
He
told
me
,
his
father
was
in
danger
to
be
out
;
that
several
were
now
soliciting
for
Manley
's
place
;
that
he
was
accused
of
opening
letters
;
that
Sir
Thomas
Frankland
would
sacrifice
everything
to
save
himself
;
and
in
that
,
I
fear
,
Manley
is
undone
,
etc
.
  
<EOS>
l0
.
 
<EOS>
To
-
day
I
dined
with
Lord
Mountjoy
at
Kensington
;
saw
my
mistress
,
Ophy
Butler
's
wife
,
who
is
grown
a
little
charmless
.
 
<EOS>
I
sat
till
ten
in
the
evening
with
Addison
and
Steele
:
 
<EOS>
Steele
will
certainly
lose
his
Gazetteer
's
place
,
all
the
world
detesting
his
engaging
in
parties
.
 
<EOS>
At
ten
I
went
to
the
Coffee
-
house
,
hoping
to
find
Lord
Radnor
,
whom
I
had
not
seen
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
there
;
and
for
an
hour
and
a
half
we
talked
treason
heartily
against
the
Whigs
,
their
baseness
and
ingratitude
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
am
come
home
,
rolling
resentments
in
my
mind
,
and
framing
schemes
of
revenge
:
 
full
of
which
<EOS>
(
having
written
down
some
hints
)
I
go
to
bed
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
afraid
MD
dined
at
home
,
because
it
is
Sunday
;
and
there
was
the
little
half
-
pint
of
wine
:
 
for
God
's
sake
,
be
good
girls
,
and
all
will
be
well
.
 
<EOS>
Ben
Tooke
was
with
me
this
morning
.
  
<EOS>
11
.
 
<EOS>
Seven
,
morning
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
rising
to
go
to
Jervas
to
finish
my
picture
,
and
'
tis
shaving
-
day
,
so
good
-
morrow
MD
;
but
do
n't
keep
me
now
,
for
I
ca
n't
stay
;
and
pray
dine
with
the
Dean
,
but
do
n't
lose
your
money
.
 
<EOS>
I
long
to
hear
from
you
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
Ten
at
night
.
 
<EOS>
I
sat
four
hours
this
morning
to
Jervas
,
who
has
given
my
picture
quite
another
turn
,
and
now
approves
it
entirely
;
but
we
must
have
the
approbation
of
the
town
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
were
rich
enough
,
I
would
get
a
copy
of
it
,
and
bring
it
over
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Addison
and
I
dined
together
at
his
lodgings
,
and
I
sat
with
him
part
of
this
evening
;
and
I
am
now
come
home
to
write
an
hour
.
 
<EOS>
Patrick
observes
,
that
the
rabble
here
are
much
more
inquisitive
in
politics
than
in
Ireland
.
 
<EOS>
Every
day
we
expect
changes
,
and
the
Parliament
to
be
dissolved
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Wharton
expects
every
day
to
be
out
:
 
he
is
working
like
a
horse
for
elections
;
and
,
in
short
,
I
never
saw
so
great
<EOS>
a
ferment
among
all
sorts
of
people
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
a
miserable
letter
from
Joe
last
Saturday
,
telling
me
Mr.
Pratt
refuses
payment
of
his
money
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
told
it
Mr.
Addison
,
and
will
to
Lord
Wharton
;
but
I
fear
with
no
success
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
I
will
do
all
I
can
.
  
<EOS>
12
.
 
<EOS>
To
-
day
I
presented
Mr.
Ford
to
the
Duke
of
Ormond
;
and
paid
my
first
visit
to
Lord
President
,
with
whom
I
had
much
discourse
;
but
put
him
always
off
when
he
began
to
talk
of
Lord
Wharton
in
relation
to
me
,
till
he
urged
it
:
 
<EOS>
then
I
said
,
he
knew
I
never
expected
anything
from
Lord
Wharton
,
and
that
Lord
Wharton
knew
that
I
understood
it
so
.
 
<EOS>
He
said
that
he
had
written
twice
to
Lord
Wharton
about
me
,
who
both
times
said
nothing
at
all
to
that
part
of
his
letter
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
advised
not
to
meddle
in
the
affair
of
the
First
-
Fruits
,
till
this
hurry
is
a
little
over
,
which
still
depends
,
and
we
are
all
in
the
dark
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
President
told
me
he
expects
every
day
to
be
out
,
and
has
done
so
these
two
months
.
 
<EOS>
I
protest
,
upon
my
life
,
I
am
heartily
weary
of
this
town
,
and
wish
I
had
never
stirred
.
  
<EOS>
13
.
 
<EOS>
I
went
this
morning
to
the
city
,
to
see
Mr.
Stratford
the
Hamburg
merchant
,
my
old
schoolfellow
;
but
calling
at
Bull
's
on
Ludgate
Hill
,
he
forced
me
to
his
house
at
Hampstead
to
dinner
among
a
great
deal
of
ill
company
;
among
the
rest
<EOS>
Mr.
Hoadley
,
the
Whig
clergyman
,
so
famous
for
acting
the
contrary
part
to
Sacheverell
:
  
<EOS>
but
tomorrow
I
design
again
to
see
Stratford
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
glad
,
however
,
to
be
at
Hampstead
,
where
I
saw
Lady
Lucy
and
Moll
Stanhope
.
 
<EOS>
I
hear
very
unfortunate
news
of
Mrs.
Long
;
she
and
her
comrade
have
broke
up
house
,
and
she
is
broke
for
good
and
all
,
and
is
gone
to
the
country
:
 
<EOS>
I
should
be
extremely
sorry
if
this
be
true
.
  
<EOS>
14
.
 
<EOS>
To
-
day
,
I
saw
Patty
Rolt
,
who
heard
I
was
in
town
;
and
I
dined
with
Stratford
at
a
merchant
's
in
the
city
,
where
I
drank
the
first
Tokay
wine
I
ever
saw
;
and
it
is
admirable
,
yet
not
to
the
degree
I
expected
.
 
<EOS>
Stratford
is
worth
a
plum
,
and
is
now
lending
the
Government
forty
thousand
pounds
;
yet
we
were
educated
together
at
the
same
school
and
university
.
 
<EOS>
We
hear
the
Chancellor
is
to
be
suddenly
out
,
and
Sir
Simon
Harcourt
to
succeed
him
:
 
<EOS>
I
am
come
early
home
,
not
caring
for
the
Coffee
-
house
.
  
<EOS>
15
.
 
<EOS>
To
-
day
Mr.
Addison
,
Colonel
Freind
,
and
I
,
went
to
see
the
million
lottery
drawn
at
Guildhall
.
 
<EOS>
The
jackanapes
of
bluecoat
boys
gave
themselves
such
airs
in
pulling
out
the
tickets
,
and
showed
white
hands
open
to
the
company
,
to
let
us
see
there
was
no
cheat
.
 
<EOS>
We
dined
at
a
country
-
house
near
Chelsea
,
where
Mr.
Addison
often
retires
;
and
to
-
night
,
at
the
Coffee
-
house
,
we
hear
Sir
Simon
Harcourt
is
made
Lord
Keeper
;
so
that
now
we
expect
every
moment
the
Parliament
will
be
dissolved
;
but
I
forgot
that
this
letter
will
not
go
in
three
or
four
days
,
and
that
my
news
will
be
stale
,
which
I
should
therefore
put
in
the
last
paragraph
.
 
<EOS>
Shall
I
send
this
letter
before
I
hear
from
MD
,
or
shall
I
keep
it
to
lengthen
?
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
yet
seen
Stella
's
mother
,
because
I
will
not
see
Lady
Giffard
;
but
I
will
contrive
to
go
there
when
Lady
Giffard
is
abroad
.
 
<EOS>
I
forgot
to
mark
my
two
former
letters
;
but
I
remember
this
is
Number
3
,
and
I
have
not
yet
had
Number
1
from
MD
;
but
I
shall
by
Monday
,
which
I
reckon
will
be
just
a
fortnight
after
you
had
my
first
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
resolved
to
bring
over
a
great
deal
of
china
.
 
<EOS>
I
loved
it
mightily
to
-
day
.
 
<EOS>
What
shall
I
bring
?

Morning

<EOS>
Sir
John
Holland
,
Comptroller
of
the
Household
,
has
sent
to
desire
my
acquaintance
:
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
mind
to
refuse
him
,
because
he
is
a
Whig
,
and
will
,
I
suppose
,
be
out
among
the
rest
;
but
he
is
a
man
of
worth
and
learning
.
 
<EOS>
Tell
me
,
do
you
like
this
journal
way
of
writing
?
 
<EOS>
Is
it
not
tedious
and
dull
?
  
<EOS>
Night
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
to
-
day
with
a
cousin
,
a
printer
,
where
Patty
Rolt
lodges
,
and
then
came
home
,
after
a
visit
or
two
;
and
it
has
been
a
very
insipid
day
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Long
's
misfortune
is
confirmed
to
me
;
bailiffs
were
in
her
house
;
she
retired
to
private
lodgings
;
thence
to
the
country
,
nobody
knows
where
:
 
her
friends
leave
letters
at
some
inn
,
and
they
are
carried
to
her
;
and
she
writes
answers
without
dating
them
from
any
place
.
 
<EOS>
I
swear
,
it
grieves
me
to
the
soul
.
  
<EOS>

<EOS>
To
-
day
I
dined
six
miles
out
of
town
,
with
Will
Pate
,
the
learned
woollen
-
draper
;
Mr.
Stratford
went
with
me
;
six
miles
here
is
nothing
:
 
<EOS>
we
left
Pate
after
sunset
,
and
were
here
before
it
was
dark
.
 
<EOS>
This
letter
shall
go
on
Tuesday
,
whether
I
hear
from
MD
or
no
.
 
<EOS>
My
health
continues
pretty
well
;
pray
God
Stella
may
give
me
a
good
account
of
hers
!
<EOS>
and
I
hope
you
are
now
at
Trim
,
or
soon
designing
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
disappointed
to
-
night
:
 
<EOS>
the
fellow
gave
me
a
letter
,
and
I
hoped
to
see
little
MD
's
hand
;
and
it
was
only
to
invite
me
to
a
venison
pasty
to
-
day
:
 
<EOS>
so
I
lost
my
pasty
into
the
bargain
.
 
<EOS>
Pox
on
these
declining
courtiers
!
 
<EOS>
Here
is
Mr.
Brydges
,
the
Paymaster
-
General
,
desiring
my
acquaintance
;
but
I
hear
the
Queen
sent
Lord
Shrewsbury
to
assure
him
he
may
keep
his
place
;
and
he
promises
me
great
assistance
in
the
affair
of
the
First
-
Fruits
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
I
must
turn
over
this
leaf
to
-
night
,
though
the
side
would
hold
another
line
;
but
pray
consider
this
is
a
whole
sheet
;
it
holds
a
plaguy
deal
,
and
you
must
be
content
to
be
weary
;
but
I
'll
do
so
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
Simon
Harcourt

<EOS>
To
-
day
I
dined
with
Mr.
Stratford
at
Mr.
Addison
's
retirement
near
Chelsea
;
then
came
to
town
;
got
home
early
,
and
began
a
letter
to
the
Tatler
,
about
the
corruptions
of
style
and
writing
,
etc
.
,
and
,
having
not
heard
from
you
,
am
resolved
this
letter
shall
go
to
-
night
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Wharton
was
sent
for
to
town
in
mighty
haste
,
by
the
Duke
of
Devonshire
:
 
<EOS>
they
have
some
project
in
hand
;
but
it
will
not
do
,
for
every
hour
we
expect
a
thorough
revolution
,
and
that
the
Parliament
will
be
dissolved
.
 
<EOS>
When
you
see
Joe
,
tell
him
Lord
Wharton
is
too
busy
to
mind
any
of
his
affairs
;
but
I
will
get
what
good
offices
I
can
from
Mr.
Addison
,
and
will
write
to
-
day
to
Mr.
Pratt
;
and
bid
Joe
not
to
be
discouraged
,
for
I
am
confident
he
will
get
the
money
under
any
Government
;
but
he
must
have
patience
.
  
<EOS>

<EOS>
I
have
been
scribbling
this
morning
,
and
I
believe
shall
hardly
fill
this
side
to
-
day
,
but
send
it
as
it
is
;
and
it
is
good
enough
for
naughty
girls
that
wo
n't
write
to
a
body
,
and
to
a
good
boy
like
Presto
.
 
<EOS>
I
thought
to
have
sent
this
to
-
night
,
but
was
kept
by
company
,
and
could
not
;
and
,
to
say
the
truth
,
I
had
a
little
mind
to
expect
one
post
more
for
a
letter
from
MD
.
<EOS>
Yesterday
at
noon
died
the
Earl
of
Anglesea
,
the
great
support
of
the
Tories
;
so
that
employment
of
Vice
-
Treasurer
of
Ireland
is
again
vacant
.
 
<EOS>
We
were
to
have
been
great
friends
,
and
I
could
hardly
have
a
loss
that
could
grieve
me
more
.
 
<EOS>
The
Bishop
of
Durham
died
the
same
day
.
 
<EOS>
The
Duke
of
Ormond
's
daughter
was
to
visit
me
to
-
day
at
a
third
place
by
way
of
advance
,
and
I
am
to
return
it
to
-
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
had
a
letter
from
Lady
Berkeley
,
begging
me
for
charity
to
come
to
Berkeley
Castle
,
for
company
to
my
lord
,
who
has
been
ill
of
a
dropsy
;
but
I
can
not
go
,
and
must
send
my
excuse
to
-
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
told
that
in
a
few
hours
there
will
be
more
removals
.
  
<EOS>
20
.
 
<EOS>
To
-
day
I
returned
my
visits
to
the
Duke
's
daughters
;
the
insolent
drabs
came
up
to
my
very
mouth
to
salute
me
.
 
<EOS>
Then
I
heard
the
report
confirmed
of
removals
;
my
Lord
President
Somers
;
the
Duke
of
Devonshire
,
Lord
Steward
;
and
Mr.
Boyle
,
Secretary
of
State
,
are
all
turned
out
to
-
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
remember
such
bold
steps
taken
by
a
Court
:
 
<EOS>
I
am
almost
shocked
at
it
,
though
I
did
not
care
if
they
were
all
hanged
.
 
<EOS>
We
are
astonished
why
the
Parliament
is
not
yet
dissolved
,
and
why
they
keep
a
matter
of
that
importance
to
the
last
.
 
<EOS>
We
shall
have
a
strange
winter
here
,
between
the
struggles
of
a
cunning
provoked
discarded
party
,
and
the
triumphs
of
one
in
power
;
of
both
which
I
shall
be
an
indifferent
spectator
,
and
return
very
peaceably
to
Ireland
,
when
I
have
done
my
part
in
the
affair
I
am
entrusted
with
,
whether
it
succeeds
or
no
.
 
<EOS>
To
-
morrow
<EOS>
I
change
my
lodgings
in
Pall
Mall
for
one
in
Bury
Street
,
where
I
suppose
I
shall
continue
while
I
stay
in
London
.

If
anything
happens
tomorrow
,
I
will
add
it

We
have
great
news
just
now
from

Madrid
taken

Pampeluna

<EOS>
I
am

ever
interrupted

<EOS>

<EOS>
I
have
just
received
your
letter
,
which
I
will
not
answer
now
;
God
be
thanked
all
things
are
so
well
.
 
<EOS>
I
find
you
have
not
yet
had
my
second
:
 
<EOS>
I
had
a
letter
from
Parvisol
,
who
tells
me
he
gave
Mrs.
Walls
a
bill
of
twenty
pounds
for
me
,
to
be
given
to
you
;
but
you
have
not
sent
it
.
 
<EOS>
This
night
the
Parliament
is
dissolved
:
 
great
news
from
Spain
;
<EOS>
King
Charles
and
Stanhope
are
at
Madrid
,
and
Count
Staremberg
has
taken

<EOS>
Farewell

<EOS>
This
is
from
St.
James
's
Coffee

house

<EOS>
I
will
begin
my
answer
to
your
letter
to
-
night
,
but
not
send
it
this
week
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
tell
me
whether
you
like
this
journal
way
of
writing
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
like
your
reasons
for
not
going
to
Trim
.
 
<EOS>
Parvisol
tells
me
he
can
sell
your
horse
.
 
<EOS>
Sell
it
,
with
a
pox
?
 
<EOS>
Pray
let
him
know
that
he
shall
sell
his
soul
as
soon
.
 
<EOS>
What
?
<EOS>
sell
anything
that
Stella
loves
,
and
may
sometimes
ride
?
<EOS>
It
is
hers
,
and
let
her
do
as
she
pleases
:
 
<EOS>
pray
let
him
know
this
by
the
first
that
you
know
goes
to
Trim
.
 
<EOS>
Let
him
sell
my
grey
,
and
be
hanged

LETTER
4
.
 
<EOS>
LONDON
,
Sept.
21
,
1710
.
  
<EOS>
Here
must
I
begin
another
letter
,
on
a
whole
sheet
,
for
fear
saucy
little
MD
should
be
angry
,
and
think
MUCH
that
the
paper
is
too
LITTLE
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
your
letter
this
night
,
as
told
you
just
and
no
more
in
my
last
;
for
this
must
be
taken
up
in
answering
yours
,
saucebox
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
I
told
you
where
I
dined
to
-
day
;
and
to
-
morrow
I
go
out
of
town
for
two
days
to
dine
with
the
same
company
on
Sunday
;
Molesworth
the
Florence
Envoy
,
Stratford
,
and
some
others
.
 
<EOS>
I
heard
to
-
day
that
a
gentlewoman
from
Lady
Giffard
's
house
had
been
at
the
Coffee
-
house
to
inquire
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
Stella
's
mother
,
I
suppose
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
send
her
a
penny
-
post
letter
to
-
morrow
,
and
contrive
to
see
her
without
hazarding
seeing
Lady
Giffard
,
which
I
will
not
do
until
she
begs
my
pardon
.
  
<EOS>
22
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
to
-
day
at
Hampstead
with
Lady
Lucy
,
etc
.
,
and
when
I
got
home
found
a
letter
from
Joe
,
with
one
enclosed
to
Lord
Wharton
,
which
I
will
send
to
his
Excellency
,
and
second
it
as
well
as
I
can
;
but
to
talk
of
getting
the
Queen
's
order
is
a
jest
.
 
<EOS>
Things
are
in
such
a
combustion
here
,
that
I
am
advised
not
to
meddle
yet
in
the
affair
I
am
upon
,
which
concerns
the
clergy
of
a
whole
kingdom
;
and
does
he
think
anybody
will
trouble
the
Queen
about
Joe
?
 
<EOS>
We
shall
<EOS>
,
I
hope
,
get
a
recommendation
from
the
Lord
Lieutenant
to
the
trustees
for
the
linen
business
,
and
I
hope
that
will
do
;
and
<EOS>
so
I
will
write
to
him
in
a
few
days
,
and
he
must
have
patience
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
an
answer
to
part
of
your
letter
as
well
as
his
.
 
<EOS>
I
lied
;
it
is
to
-
morrow
<EOS>
I
go
to
the
country
,
and
I
wo
n't
answer
a
bit
more
of
your
letter
yet
.

Here
is
such
a
stir
and
bustle
with
this
little
MD
of
ours
;
I
must
be
writing
every
night

I
ca
n't
go
to
bed
without
a
word
to
them

I
ca
n't
put
out
my

good

night

O

<EOS>
Well

I
dined
the
first
time
to

day
,
with
Will
Frankland
and
his
fortune

<EOS>
she
is
not
very
handsome
.
 
<EOS>
Did
I
not
say
I
would
go
out
of
town
to
-
day
?
 
<EOS>
I
hate
lying
abroad
and
clutter
;
I
go
tomorrow
in
Frankland
's
chariot
,
and
come
back
at
night
.

Lady
Berkeley
has
invited
me

Berkeley
Castle

Drayton

Northamptonshire

I
'll
go
to
neither

<EOS>
Let
me
alone

I
must
finish
my
pamphlet
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
sent
a
long
letter
to
Bickerstaff
:
let
the
Bishop
of
Clogher
smoke
it
if
he
can
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
I
'll
write
to
the
Bishop
of
Killala
;
but
you
might
have
told
him
how
sudden
and
unexpected
my
journey
was
though
.

Deuce

he
is
a

faced
fellow

not
handsome
,
nor
visibly
so
young
as
you
say
:
 
<EOS>
she
sacrifices
two
thousand
pounds
a
year
,
and
keeps
only
six
hundred

<EOS>
Well
,
you
have
had
all
my
land
journey
in
my
second
letter
,
and
so
much
for
that
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
you
have
got
into
Presto
's
lodgings
;
very
fine
,
truly

<EOS>
We
have
had
a
fortnight
of
the
most
glorious
weather

and
still
continues

I
hope
you
have
made
the
best
of
it

house
.
 
<EOS>
Write
constantly
!
 
<EOS>
Why
,
sirrah
,
do
n't
I
write
every
day
,
and
sometimes
twice
a
day
to
MD
?
 
<EOS>
Now
I
have
answered
all
your
letter
,
and
the
rest
must
be
as
it
can
be
:
 
send
me
my
bill
.
 
<EOS>
Tell
Mrs.
Brent
what
I
say
of
the
Charter
-
house
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
this
enough
for
one
night
;
and
so
farewell
till
this
time
to
-
morrow
.
  
<EOS>
24
.
 
<EOS>
To
-
day
I
dined
six
miles
out
of
town
at
Will
Pate
's
,
with
Stratford
,
Frankland
,
and
the
Molesworths
,
and
came
home
at
night
,
and
was
weary
and
lazy
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
say
no
more
now
,
but
good
-
night
.
  
<EOS>
25
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
so
lazy
to
-
day
that
I
dined
at
next
door
,
and
have
sat
at
home
since
six
,
writing
to
the
Bishop
of
Clogher
,
Dean
Sterne
,
and
Mr.
Manley
:
 
<EOS>
the
last
,
<EOS>
because
I
am
in
fear
for
him
about
his
place
,
and
have
sent
him
my
opinion
,
what
I
and
his
other
friends
here
think
he
ought
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
he
will
take
it
well
.
 
<EOS>
My
advice
was
,
to
keep
as
much
in
favour
as
possible
with
Sir
Thomas
Frankland
,
his
master
here
.
  
<EOS>
26
.
 
<EOS>
Smoke
how
I
widen
the
margin
by
lying
in
bed
when
I
write
.
 
<EOS>
My
bed
lies
on
the
wrong
side
for
me
,
so
that
I
am
forced
often
to
write
when
I
am
up
.
<EOS>
Manley
,
you
must
know
,
has
had
people
putting
in
for
his
place
already
;
and
has
been
complained
of
for
opening
letters
.
 
<EOS>
Remember
that
last
Sunday
,
September
24
,
1710
,
was
as
hot
as
midsummer
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
written
in
the
morning
;
it
is
now
night
,
and
Presto
in
bed
.
 
<EOS>
Here
's
a
clutter
,
I
have
gotten
MD
's
second
letter
,
and
I
must
answer
it
here
.
 
<EOS>
I
gave
the
bill
to
Tooke
,
and
so
 
Well
,
I
dined
to
-
day
with
Sir
John
Holland
the
Comptroller
,
and
sat
with
him
till
eight
;
then
came
home
,
and
sent
my
letters
,
and
writ
part
of
a
lampoon
,
which
goes
on
very
slow
:
 
and
now
I
am
writing
to
saucy
MD
;
no
wonder
,
indeed
,
<EOS>
good
boys
must
write
to
naughty
girls
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
seen
your
mother
yet
;
my
penny
-
post
letter
,
I
suppose
,
miscarried
:
 
I
will
write
another
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
S
#
#
#
#
came
to
see
me
;
and
said
M
#
#
#
#
was
going
to
the
country
next
morning
with
her
husband
(
who
I
find
is
a
surly
brute
)
;
<EOS>
so
I
could
only
desire
my
service
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
27
.
 
<EOS>
To
-
day
all
our
company
dined
at
Will
Frankland
's
,
with
Steele
and
Addison
too
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
the
first
rainy
day
since
I
came
to
town
;
I
can
not
afford
to
answer
your
letter
yet
.
 
<EOS>
Morgan
,
the
puppy
,
writ
me
a
long
letter
,
to
desire
I
would
recommend
him
for
purse
-
bearer
or
secretary
to
the
next
Lord
Chancellor
that
would
come
with
the
next
Governor
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
not
answer
him
;
but
beg
you
will
say
these
words
to
his
father
Raymond
,
or
anybody
that
will
tell
him
:
 
That
Dr.
Swift
has
received
his
letter
;
and
would
be
very
ready
to
serve
him
,
but
can
not
do
it
in
what
he
desires
,
because
he
has
no
sort
of
interest
in
the
persons
to
be
applied
to
.
 
<EOS>
These
words
you
may
write
,
and
let
Joe
,
or
Mr.
Warburton
,
give
them
to
him
:
 
a
pox
on
him
!
 
<EOS>
However
,
it
is
by
these
sort
of
ways
that
fools
get
preferment
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
not
end
yet
,
because
I
can
not
say
good
-
night
without
losing
a
line
,
and
then
MD
would
scold
;
but
now
,
good
-
night
.
  
<EOS>
28
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
the
finest
piece
of
Brazil
tobacco
for
Dingley
that
ever
was
born
.
 
<EOS>
You
talk
of
Leigh
;
why
,
he
wo
n't
be
in
Dublin
these
two
months
:
 
<EOS>
he
goes
to
the
country
,
then
returns
to
London
,
to
see
how
the
world
goes
here
in
Parliament
.
 
<EOS>
Good
-
night
,
sirrahs
;
no
,
no
,
not
night
;
I
writ
this
in
the
morning
,
and
looking
carelessly
<EOS>
I
thought
it
had
been
of
last
night
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
to
-
day
with
Mrs.
Barton
alone
at
her
lodgings
;
where
she
told
me
for
certain
,
that
Lady
S
#
#
#
#
 
was
with
child
when
she
was
last
in
England
,
and
pretended
a
tympany
,
and
saw
everybody
;
then
disappeared
for
three
weeks
,
her
tympany
was
gone
,
and
she
looked
like
a
ghost
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
No
wonder
she
married
when
she
was
so
ill
at
containing
.
 
<EOS>
Connolly
is
out
;
and
Mr.
Roberts
in
his
place
,
who
loses
a
better
here
,
but
was
formerly
a
Commissioner
in
Ireland
.
 
<EOS>
That
employment
cost
Connolly
three
thousand
pounds
to
Lord
Wharton
;
so
he
has
made
one
ill
bargain
in
his
life
.
  
<EOS>
29
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
MD
a
merry
Michaelmas
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
with
Mr.
Addison
,
and
Jervas
the
painter
,
at
Addison
's
country
place
;
and
then
came
home
,
and
writ
more
to
my
lampoon
.
 
<EOS>
I
made
a
Tatler
since
I
came
:
 
guess
which
it
is
,
and
whether
the
Bishop
of
Clogher
smokes
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
saw
Mr.
Sterne
to
-
day
:
 
he
will
do
as
you
order
,
and
I
will
give
him
chocolate
for
Stella
's
health
.
 
<EOS>
He
goes
not
these
three
weeks
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
I
could
send
it
some
other
way
.
 
<EOS>
So
now
to
your
letter
,
brave
boys
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
like
your
way
of
saving
shillings
:
 
<EOS>
nothing
vexes
me
but
that
it
does
not
make
Stella
a
coward
in
a
coach
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
think
any
lady
's
advice
about
my
ear
signifies
twopence
:
 
however
I
will
,
in
compliance
to
you
,
ask
Dr.
Cockburn
.
 
<EOS>
Radcliffe
I
know
not
,
and
Barnard
<EOS>
I
never
see
.
<EOS>
Walls
will
certainly
be
stingier
for
seven
years
,
upon
pretence
of
his
robbery
.
 
<EOS>
So
Stella
puns
again
;
why
,
'
tis
well
enough
;
but
I
'll
not
second
it
,
though
I
could
make
a
dozen
:
 
<EOS>
I
never
thought
of
a
pun
since
I
left
Ireland
.
  
<EOS>
Bishop
of
Clogher
's
bill
?
 
<EOS>
Why
,
he
paid
it
to
me
;
do
you
think
I
was
such
a
fool
to
go
without
it
?
 
<EOS>
As
for
the
four
shillings
,
I
will
give
you
a
bill
on
Parvisol
for
it
on
t'other
side
of
this
paper
;
and
pray
tear
off
the
two
letters
I
shall
write
to
him
and
Joe
,
or
let
Dingley
transcribe
and
send
them
;
though
that
to
Parvisol
,
I
believe
,
he
must
have
my
hand
for
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
no
,
I
'll
eat
no
grapes
;
I
ate
about
six
the
other
day
at
Sir
John
Holland
's
;
but
would
not
give
sixpence
for
a
thousand
,
they
are
so
bad
this
year
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
faith
,
I
hope
in
God
Presto
and
MD
will
be
together
this
time
twelvemonth
.
 
<EOS>
What
then
?
<EOS>
Last
year
I
suppose
I
was
at
Laracor
;
but
next
I
hope
to
eat
my
Michaelmas
goose
at
my
two
little
gooses
"
lodgings
.
 
<EOS>
I
drink
no
aile
<EOS>
(
I
suppose
you
mean
ale
)
;
but
yet
good
wine
every
day
,
of
five
and
six
shillings
a
bottle
.
 
<EOS>
O
Lord
,
how
much
Stella
writes
!
<EOS>
pray
do
n't
carry
that
too
far
,
young
women
,
but
be
temperate
,
to
hold
out
.
 
<EOS>
To
-
morrow
<EOS>
I
go
to
Mr.
Harley
.
<EOS>
Why
,
small
hopes
from
the
Duke
of
Ormond
:
 
<EOS>
he
loves
me
very
well
,
I
believe
,
and
would
,
in
my
turn
,
give
me
something
to
make
me
easy
;
and
I
have
good
interest
among
his
best
friends
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
do
n't
think
of
anything
further
than
the
business
I
am
upon
.
 
<EOS>
You
see
I
writ
to
Manley
before
I
had
your
letter
,
and
I
fear
he
will
be
out
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
Mrs.
Owl
,
Bligh
's
corpse
came
to
Chester
when
I
was
there
;
and
I
told
you
so
in
my
letter
,
or
forgot
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
lodge
in
Bury
Street
,
where
I
removed
a
week
ago
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
the
first
floor
,
a
dining
-
room
,
and
bed
-
chamber
,
at
eight
shillings
a
week
;
<EOS>
plaguy
deep
,
but
I
spend
nothing
for
eating
,
never
go
to
a
tavern
,
and
very
seldom
in
a
coach
;
yet
after
all
it
will
be
expensive
.
 
<EOS>
Why
do
you
trouble
yourself
,
Mistress
Stella
,
about
my
instrument
?
<EOS>
I
have
the
same
the
Archbishop
gave
me
;
and
it
is
as
good
<EOS>
now
the
bishops
are
away
.
 
<EOS>
The
Dean
friendly
!
<EOS>
the
Dean
be
poxed
:
 
a
great
piece
of
friendship
indeed
,
what
you
heard
him
tell
the
Bishop
of
Clogher
<EOS>
;
I
wonder
he
had
the
face
to
talk
so
:
 
but
he
lent
me
money
,
and
that
's
enough
.
 
<EOS>
Faith
,
I
would
not
send
this
these
four
days
,
only
for
writing
to
Joe
and
Parvisol
.
 
<EOS>
Tell
the
Dean
that
when
the
bishops
send
me
any
packets
,
they
must
not
write
to
me
at
Mr.
Steele
's
;
but
direct
for
Mr.
Steele
,
at
his
office
at
the
Cockpit
,
and
let
the
enclosed
be
directed
for
me
:
 
that
mistake
cost
me
eighteenpence
the
other
day
.
  
<EOS>
30
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
with
Stratford
to
-
day
,
but
am
not
to
see
Mr.
Harley
till
Wednesday
:
 
<EOS>
it
is
late
,
and
I
send
this
before
there
is
occasion
for
the
bell
;
because
I
would
have
Joe
have
his
letter
,
and
Parvisol
too
;
<EOS>
which
you
must
so
contrive
as
not
to
cost
them
double
postage
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
say
no
more
,
but
that
I
am
,
etc

LETTER
5
.
 
<EOS>
LONDON
,
Sept.
30
,
1710
.
  
<EOS>
Han't
<EOS>
I
brought
myself
into
a
fine
praemunire
,
to
begin
writing
letters
in
whole
sheets
?
<EOS>
and
now
I
dare
not
leave
it
off
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
tell
whether
you
like
these
journal
letters
:
 
<EOS>
I
believe
they
would
be
dull
to
me
to
read
them
over
;
but
,
perhaps
,
little
MD
is
pleased
to
know
how
Presto
passes
his
time
in
her
absence
.
 
<EOS>
I
always
begin
my
last
the
same
day
I
ended
my
former
.
 
<EOS>
I
told
you
where
I
dined
to
-
day
at
a
tavern
with
Stratford
:
 
Lewis
,
who
is
a
great
favourite
of
Harley
's
,
was
to
have
been
with
us
;
but
he
was
hurried
to
Hampton
Court
,
and
sent
his
excuse
;
and
that
next
Wednesday
he
would
introduce
me
to
Harley
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
good
to
see
what
a
lamentable
confession
<EOS>
the
Whigs
all
make
me
of
my
ill
usage
:
 
<EOS>
but
I
mind
them
not
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
already
represented
to
Harley
as
a
discontented
person
,
that
was
used
ill
for
not
being
Whig
enough
;
and
I
hope
for
good
usage
from
him
.
 
<EOS>
The
Tories
drily
tell
me
,
I
may
make
my
fortune
,
if
I
please
;
but
I
do
not
understand
them
 
or
rather
,
I
do
understand
them
.
  
<EOS>
Oct.

.
 
<EOS>
To
-
day
I
dined
at
Molesworth
's
,
the
Florence
Envoy
;
and
sat
this
evening
with
my
friend
Darteneuf
,
whom
you
have
heard
me
talk
of
;
the
greatest
punner
of
this
town
next
myself
.
 
<EOS>
Have
you
smoked
the
Tatler
that
I
writ
?
 
<EOS>
It
is
much
liked
here
,
and
I
think
it
a
pure
one
.
 
<EOS>
To
-
morrow
<EOS>
I
go
with
Delaval
,
the
Portugal
Envoy
,
to
dine
with
Lord
Halifax
near
Hampton
Court
.
 
<EOS>
Your
Manley
's
brother
,
a
Parliament
-
man
here
,
has
gotten
an
employment
;
and
I
am
informed
uses
much
interest
to
preserve
his
brother
:
and
,
to
-
day
,
I
spoke
to
the
elder
Frankland
to
engage
his
father
(
Postmaster
here
)
;
and
I
hope
he
will
be
safe
,
although
he
is
cruelly
hated
by
all
the
Tories
of
Ireland
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
almost
finished
my
lampoon
,
and
will
print
it
for
revenge
on
a
certain
great
person
.
 
<EOS>
It
has
cost
me
but
three
shillings
in
meat
and
drink
since
I
came
here
,
as
thin
as
the
town
is
.
 
<EOS>
I
laugh
to
see
myself
so
disengaged
in
these
revolutions
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
I
must
leave
off
,
and
go
write
to
Sir
John
Stanley
,
to
desire
him
to
engage
Lady
Hyde
as
my
mistress
to
engage
Lord
Hyde
in
favour
of
Mr.
Pratt
.
  
<EOS>

.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Halifax
was
at
Hampton
Court
at
his
lodgings
,
and
I
dined
with
him
there
with
Methuen
,
and
Delaval
,
and
the
late
Attorney
-
General
.
<EOS>
I
went
to
the
Drawing
-
room
before
dinner
(
for
the
Queen
was
at
Hampton
Court
)
,
and
expected
to
see
nobody
;
but
I
met
acquaintance
enough
.
 
<EOS>
I
walked
in
the
gardens
,
saw
the
cartoons
of
Raphael
,
and
other
things
;
and
with
great
difficulty
got
from
Lord
Halifax
,
who
would
have
kept
me
to
-
morrow
to
show
me
his
house
and
park
,
and
improvements
.
 
<EOS>
We
left
Hampton
Court
at
sunset
,
and
got
here
in
a
chariot
and
two
horses
time
enough
by
starlight

That
's
something
<EOS>
charms
me
mightily
about
London
<EOS>
;
that
you
go
dine
a
dozen
miles
off
in
October
,
stay
all
day
,
and
return
so
quickly
:
 
<EOS>
you
can
not
do
anything
like
this
in
Dublin
.
<EOS>
I
writ
a
second
penny
post
letter
to
your
mother
,
and
hear
nothing
of
her
.
 
<EOS>
Did
I
tell
you
that
Earl
Berkeley
died
last
Sunday
was
se'nnight
,
at
Berkeley
Castle
,
of
a
dropsy
?
 
<EOS>
Lord
Halifax
began
a
health
to
me
to
-
day
;
it
was
the
Resurrection
of
the
Whigs
,
which
I
refused
unless
he
would
add
their
Reformation
too
and
<EOS>
I
told
him
he
was
the
only
Whig
in
England
I
loved
,
or
had
any
good
opinion
of
.

This
morning
Stella
's
sister
came
to
me
with
a
letter
from
her
mother
,
who
is
at
Sheen
;
but
will
soon
be
in
town
,
and
will
call
to
see
me
:
 
<EOS>
she
gave
me
a
bottle
of
palsy
water
,
a
small
one
,
and
desired
I
would
send
it
you
by
the
first
convenience
,
as
I
will
;
and
she
promises
a
quart
bottle
of
the
same
:
 
<EOS>
your
sister
looked
very
well
,
and
seems
a
good
modest
sort
of
girl
.
 
<EOS>
I
went
then
to
Mr.
Lewis
,
first
secretary
to
Lord
Dartmouth
,
and
favourite
to
Mr.
Harley
,
who
is
to
introduce
me
to
-
morrow
morning
.
 
<EOS>
Lewis
had
with
him
one
Mr.
Dyot
,
a
Justice
of
Peace
,
worth
twenty
thousand
pounds
,
a
Commissioner
of
the
Stamp
Office
,
and
married
to
a
sister
of
Sir
Philip
Meadows
,
Envoy
to
the
Emperor
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
you
this
,
because
it
is
odds
but
this
Mr.
Dyot
will
be
hanged
;
for
he
is
discovered
to
have
counterfeited
stamped
paper
,
in
which
he
was
a
Commissioner
;
and
,
with
his
accomplices
,
has
cheated
the
Queen
of
a
hundred
thousand
pounds
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
hear
of
it
before
this
come
to
you
,
but
may
be
not
so
particularly
;
and
it
is
a
very
odd
accident
in
such
a
man
.
 
<EOS>
Smoke
Presto
writing
news
to
MD
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
to
-
day
with
Lord
Mountjoy
at
Kensington
,
and
walked
from
thence
this
evening
to
town
like
an
emperor
.
 
<EOS>
Remember
that
yesterday
,
October
2
,
was
a
cruel
hard
frost
,
with
ice
;
and
six
days
ago
I
was
dying
with
heat
.
 
<EOS>
As
thin
as
the
town
is
,
I
have
more
dinners
than
ever
;
and
am
asked
this
month
by
some
people
,
without
being
able
to
come
for
pre
-
engagements
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
but
I
should
write
plainer
,
when
I
consider
Stella
can
not
read
,
and
Dingley
is
not
so
skilful
at
my
ugly
hand
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
tonight
<EOS>
a
letter
from
Mr.
Pratt
,
who
tells
me
Joe
will
have
his
money
when
there
are
trustees
appointed
by
the
Lord
Lieutenant
for
receiving
and
disposing
the
linen
fund
;
and
whenever
those
trustees
are
appointed
,
I
will
solicit
whoever
is
Lord
Lieutenant
,
and
am
in
no
fear
of
succeeding
.
 
<EOS>
So
pray
tell
or
write
him
word
,
and
bid
him
not
be
cast
down
;
for
Ned
Southwell
and
Mr.
Addison
both
think
Pratt
in
the
right
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
lose
your
money
at
Manley
's
to
-
night

After
I
had
put
out
my
candle
last
night
,
my
landlady
came
into
my
room
,
with
a
servant
of
Lord
Halifax
,
to
desire
I
would
go
dine
with
him
at
his
house
near
Hampton
Court
;
but
I
sent
him
word
,
I
had
business
of
great
importance
that
hindered
me
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
And
to
-
day
I
was
brought
privately
to
Mr.
Harley
,
who
received
me
with
the
greatest
respect
and
kindness
imaginable
:
 
<EOS>
he
has
appointed
me
an
hour
on
Saturday
at
four
,
afternoon
,
when
I
will
open
my
business
to
him
;
which
expression
I
would
not
use
if
I
were
a
woman
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
you
smoked
it
;
but
<EOS>
I
did
not
till
I
writ
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
to
-
day
at
Mr.
Delaval
's
,
the
Envoy
for
Portugal
,
with
Nic
Rowe
the
poet
,
and
other
friends
;
and
I
gave
my
lampoon
to
be
printed
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
more
mischief
in
my
heart
;
and
I
think
it
shall
go
round
with
them
all
,
as
this
hits
,
and
I
can
find
hints
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
certain
<EOS>
I
answered
your
2d
letter
,
<EOS>
and
yet
I
do
not
find
it
here
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
it
was
in
my
4th
:
 
and
why
N.
2d
,
3d
;
is
it
not
enough
to
say
,
as
I
do
,

,

,
3
?
<EOS>
etc
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
going
to
work
at
another
Tatler
:
 
<EOS>
I
'll
be
far
enough
<EOS>
but
I
say
the
same
thing
over
two
or
three
times
,
just
as
I
do
when
I
am
talking
to
little
MD
;
but
what
care
I
?
<EOS>
they
can
read
it
as
easily
as
I
can
write
it
:
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
have
brought
these
lines
pretty
straight
again
.
 
<EOS>
I
fear
it
will
be
long
before
I
finish
two
sides
at
this
rate
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
,
dear
MD
,
when
I
occasionally
give
you
any
little
commission
mixed
with
my
letters
,
do
n't
forget
it
,
as
that
to
Morgan
and
Joe
,
etc
.
,
for
I
write
just
as
I
can
remember
,
otherwise
I
would
put
them
all
together
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
to
visit
Mr.
Sterne
to
-
day
,
and
give
him
your
commission
about
handkerchiefs
:
 
that
of
chocolate
<EOS>
I
will
do
myself
,
and
send
it
him
when
he
goes
,
and
you
'll
pay
me
when
the
GIVER
'S
BREAD
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
To
-
night
I
will
read
a
pamphlet
,
to
amuse
myself
.

God
preserve
your
dear
healths
!

This
morning
Delaval
came
to
see
me
,
and
we
went
together
to
Kneller
's
,
who
was
not
in
town
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
way
we
met
the
electors
for
Parliament
-
men
:
 
and
the
rabble
came
about
our
coach
,
crying
,
"
A
Colt
,
a
Stanhope
,
"
etc
.
 
<EOS>
We
were
afraid
of
a
dead
cat
,
or
our
glasses
broken
,
and
so
were
always
of
their
side
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
again
at
Delaval
's
;
and
in
the
evening
,
at
the
Coffee
-
house
,
heard
Sir
Andrew
Fountaine
was
come
to
town
.
 
<EOS>
This
has
been
but
an
insipid
sort
of
day
,
and
I
have
nothing
to
remark
upon
it
worth
threepence
:
 
<EOS>
I
hope
MD
had
a
better
,
with
the
Dean
,
the
Bishop
,
or
Mrs.
Walls
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
the
reason
you
lost
four
and
eightpence
last
night
but
one
at
Manley
's
was
,
because
you
played
bad
games
:
 
<EOS>
I
took
notice
of
six
that
you
had
ten
to
one
against
you
:
 
Would
any
but
a
mad
lady
go
out
twice
upon
Manilio
;
Basto
,
and
two
small
diamonds
?
<EOS>
Then
in
that
game
of
spades
,
you
blundered
when
you
had
ten
-
ace
;
I
never
saw
the
like
of
you
:
 
<EOS>
and
now
you
are
in
a
huff
because
I
tell
you
this
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
here
's
two
and
eightpence
halfpenny
towards
your
loss
.
  
<EOS>

.
 
<EOS>
Sir
Andrew
Fountaine
came
this
morning
,
and
caught
me
writing
in
bed
.
 
<EOS>
I
went
into
the
city
with
him
;
and
we
dined
at
the
Chop
-
house
with
Will
Pate
,
the
learned
woollen
-
draper
:
 
<EOS>
then
we
sauntered
at
China
-
shops
and
booksellers
;
went
to
the
tavern
,
drank
two
pints
of
white
wine
,
and
never
parted
till
ten
:
 
and
now
I
am
come
home
,
and
must
copy
out
some
papers
I
intend
for
Mr.
Harley
,
whom
I
am
to
see
,
as
I
told
you
,
to
-
morrow
afternoon
;
so
that
this
night
I
shall
say
little
to
MD
,
but
that
I
heartily
wish
myself
with
them
,
and
will
come
as
soon
as
I
either
fail
,
or
compass
my
business
.
 
<EOS>
We
now
hear
daily
of
elections
;
and
,
in
a
list
I
saw
yesterday
of
about
twenty
,
there
are
seven
or
eight
more
Tories
than
in
the
last
Parliament
;
so
that
I
believe
they
need
not
fear
a
majority
,
with
the
help
of
those
who
will
vote
as
the
Court
pleases
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
have
been
told
that
Mr.
Harley
himself
would
not
let
the
Tories
be
too
numerous
,
for
fear
they
should
be
insolent
,
and
kick
against
him
;
and
for
that
reason
they
have
kept
several
Whigs
in
employments
,
who
expected
to
be
turned
out
every
day
;
as
Sir
John
Holland
the
Comptroller
,
and
many
others
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
get
you
gone
to
your
cards
,
and
your
claret
and
orange
,
at
the
Dean
's
;
and
I
'll
go
write
.
  
<EOS>
7
.
 
<EOS>
I
wonder
when
this
letter
will
be
finished
:
 
it
must
go
by
Tuesday
<EOS>
,
that
's
certain
;
and
if
I
have
one
from
MD
before
,
I
will
not
answer
it
<EOS>
,
that
's
as
certain
too
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
now
morning
,
<EOS>
and
I
did
not
finish
my
papers
for
Mr.
Harley
last
night
;
for
you
must
understand
Presto
was
sleepy
,
and
made
blunders
and
blots
.
 
<EOS>
Very
pretty
that
I
must
be
writing
to
young
women
in
a
morning
fresh
and
fasting
,
faith
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
good
-
morrow
to
you
;
<EOS>
and
so
I
go
to
business
,
and
lay
aside
this
paper
till
night
,
sirrahs
.
 
<EOS>
At
night

Jack
<EOS>
How
told
Harley
that
if
there
were
a
lower
place
in
hell
than
another
,
it
was
reserved
for
his
porter
,
who
tells
lies
so
gravely
,
and
with
so
civil
a
manner
.
 
<EOS>
This
porter
I
have
had
to
deal
with
,
going
this
evening
at
four
to
visit
Mr.
Harley
,
by
his
own
appointment
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
fellow
told
me
no
lie
,
though
I
suspected
every
word
he
said
.
 
<EOS>
He
told
me
his
master
was
just
gone
to
dinner
,
with
much
company
,
and
desired
I
would
come
an
hour
hence
:
 
which
I
did
,
expecting
to
hear
Mr.
Harley
was
gone
out
;
but
they
had
just
done
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Harley
came
out
to
me
,
brought
me
in
,
and
presented
to
me
his
son
-
in
-
law
Lord
Doblane
(
or
some
such
name
)
and
his
own
son
,
and
,
among
others
,
Will
Penn
the
Quaker
:
 
we
sat
two
hours
drinking
as
good
wine
as
you
do
;
and
two
hours
more
<EOS>
he
and
I
alone
<EOS>
;
where
he
heard
me
tell
my
business
;
entered
into
it
with
all
kindness
;
asked
for
my
powers
,
and
read
them
;
and
read
likewise
a
memorial
I
had
drawn
up
,
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
to
show
the
Queen
;
told
me
the
measures
he
would
take
;
and
,
in
short
,
said
everything
I
could
wish
:
 
told
me
,
he
must
bring
Mr.
St.
John
(
Secretary
of
State
)
and
me
acquainted
;
and
spoke
so
many
things
of
personal
kindness
and
esteem
for
me
,
that
I
am
inclined
half
to
believe
what
some
friends
have
told
me
,
that
he
would
do
everything
to
bring
me
over
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
desired
to
dine
with
me
<EOS>
(
what
a
comical
mistake
was
that
!
)
.
 
<EOS>
I
mean
he
has
desired
me
to
dine
with
him
on
Tuesday
;
and
after
four
hours
being
with
him
,
set
me
down
at
St.
James
's
Coffee
-
house
in
a
hackney
-
coach
.
 
<EOS>
All
this
is
odd
and
comical
,
if
you
consider
him
and
me
.
 
<EOS>
He
knew
my
Christian
name
very
well
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
forbear
saying
thus
much
upon
this
matter
,
although
you
will
think
it
tedious
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
'll
tell
you
;
you
must
know
,
'
tis
fatal
to
me
to
be
a
scoundrel
and
a
prince
the
same
day
:
 
for
,
being
to
see
him
at
four
,
I
could
not
engage
myself
to
dine
at
any
friend
's
;
so
I
went
to
Tooke
,
to
give
him
a
ballad
,
and
dine
with
him
;
but
he
was
not
at
home
:
 
<EOS>
so
I
was
forced
to
go
to
a
blind
chop
-
house
,
and
dine
for
tenpence
upon
gill
-
ale
,
bad
broth
,
and
three
chops
of
mutton
;
and
then
go
reeking
from
thence
to
the
First
Minister
of
State
.
 
<EOS>
And
now
I
am
going
in
charity
to
send
Steele
a
Tatler
,
who
is
very
low
of
late
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
am
civiller
than
I
used
to
be
;
and
have
not
used
the
expression
of
"
you
in
Ireland
"
and
"
we
in
England
"
as
I
did
when
I
was
here
before
,
to
your
great
indignation
.
 
<EOS>
They
may
talk
of
the
<EOS>
you
know
what
;
<EOS>
but
,
gad
,
if
it
had
not
been
for
that
,
I
should
never
have
been
able
to
get
the
access
I
have
had
;
and
if
that
helps
me
to
succeed
,
then
that
same
thing
will
be
serviceable
to
the
Church
.
 
<EOS>
But
how
far
we
must
depend
upon
new
friends
,
I
have
learnt
by
long
practice
,
though
I
think
among
great
Ministers
,
they
are
just
as
good
as
old
ones
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
I
think
this
important
day
has
made
a
great
hole
in
this
side
of
the
paper
;
and
the
fiddle
-
faddles
of
tomorrow
and
Monday
will
make
up
the
rest
;
and
,
besides
,
I
shall
see
Harley
on
Tuesday
before
this
letter
goes
.
  
<EOS>
8
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
tell
you
a
great
piece
of
refinement
of
Harley
.
 
<EOS>
He
charged
me
to
come
to
him
often
:
 
<EOS>
I
told
him
I
was
loth
to
trouble
him
in
so
much
business
as
he
had
,
and
desired
I
might
have
leave
to
come
at
his
levee
;
which
he
immediately
refused
,
and
said
,
that
was
not
a
place
for
friends
to
come
to
.
'
<EOS>
Tis
now
but
morning
;
and
<EOS>
I
have
got
a
foolish
trick
,
I
must
say
something
to
MD
when
I
wake
,
and
wish
them
a
good
-
morrow
;
for
this
is
not
a
shaving
-
day
,
Sunday
,
so
I
have
time
enough
:
 
but
get
you
gone
,
you
rogues
,
I
must
go
write
:
<EOS>
Yes
,
'
twill
vex
me
to
the
blood
if
any
of
these
long
letters
should
miscarry
:
 
<EOS>
if
they
do
,
I
will
shrink
to
half
-
sheets
again
;
but
then
what
will
you
do
to
make
up
the
journal
?
<EOS>
there
will
be
ten
days
of
Presto
's
life
lost
;
and
that
will
be
a
sad
thing
,
faith
and
troth
.
 
<EOS>
At
night
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
at
a
loss
today
for
a
dinner
,
unless
I
would
have
gone
a
great
way
,
<EOS>
so
I
dined
with
some
friends
that
board
hereabout
,
as
a
spunger
;
and
this
evening
Sir
Andrew
Fountaine
would
needs
have
me
go
to
the
tavern
;
<EOS>
where
,
for
two
bottles
of
wine
,
Portugal
and
Florence
,
among
three
of
us
,
we
had
sixteen
shillings
to
pay
;
but
if
ever
he
catches
me
so
again
,
I
'll
spend
as
many
pounds
:
 
<EOS>
and
therefore
I
have
it
among
my
extraordinaries
<EOS>
but
we
had
a
neck
of
mutton
dressed
a
la
Maintenon
,
that
the
dog
could
not
eat
:
 
and
it
is
now
twelve
o'clock
,
and
I
must
go
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
this
letter
will
go
before
I
have
MD
's
third
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
believe
me
?
<EOS>
and
yet
,
faith
,
I
long
for
MD
's
third
too
and
<EOS>
yet
I
would
have
it
to
say
,
that
I
writ
five
for
two
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
fond
at
all
of
St.
James
's
Coffee
-
house
,
as
I
used
to
be
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
it
will
mend
in
winter
;
but
now
they
are
all
out
of
town
at
elections
,
or
not
come
from
their
country
houses
.
 
<EOS>
Yesterday
I
was
going
with
Dr.
Garth
to
dine
with
Charles
Main
,
near
the
Tower
,
who
has
an
employment
there
:
 
<EOS>
he
is
of
Ireland
;
the
Bishop
of
Clogher
knows
him
well
:
 
an
honest
,
good
-
natured
fellow
,
a
thorough
hearty
laugher
,
mightily
beloved
by
the
men
of
wit
:
 
his
mistress
is
never
above
a
cook
-
maid
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
,
good
-
night
,
etc
.
  
<EOS>

.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
to
-
day
at
Sir
John
Stanley
's
;
my
Lady
Stanley
is
one
of
my
favourites
:
 
I
have
as
many
here
as
the
Bishop
of
Killala
has
in
Ireland
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
thinking
what
scurvy
company
I
shall
be
to
MD
when
I
come
back
:
 
<EOS>
they
know
everything
of
me
already
:
 
I
will
tell
you
no
more
,
or
I
shall
have
nothing
to
say
,
no
story
to
tell
,
nor
any
kind
of
thing
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
very
uneasy
last
night
with
ugly
,
nasty
,
filthy
wine
<EOS>
,
that
turned
sour
on
my
stomach
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
go
to
the
tavern
:
 
<EOS>
oh
,
but
I
told
you
that
before
.
 
<EOS>
To
-
morrow
I
dine
at
Harley
's
,
and
will
finish
this
letter
at
my
return
;
but
I
can
write
no
more
now
,
because
of
the
Archbishop
:
 
faith
,
'
tis
true
;
for
I
am
going
now
to
write
to
him
an
account
of
what
I
have
done
in
the
business
with
Harley
:
and
,
faith
,
young
women
<EOS>
,
I
'll
tell
you
what
you
must
count
upon
,
that
I
never
will
write
one
word
on
the
third
side
in
these
long
letters
.

<EOS>
Poor
MD
's
letter
was
lying
so
huddled
up
among
papers
,
I
could
not
find
it
:
 
<EOS>
I
mean
poor
Presto
's
letter
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
I
dined
with
Mr.
Harley
to
-
day
,
and
hope
some
things
will
be
done
;
but
I
must
say
no
more
:
 
and
this
letter
must
be
sent
to
the
post
-
house
,
and
not
by
the
bellman
.
<EOS>
I
am
to
dine
again
there
on
Sunday
next
;
I
hope
to
some
good
issue
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
now
,
soon
as
ever
I
can
in
bed
,
I
must
begin
my
6th
to
MD
as
gravely
as
if
I
had
not
written
a
word
this
month
:
 
fine
doings
,
faith
!
 
<EOS>
Methinks
I
do
n't
write
as
I
should
,
because
I
am
not
in
bed
:
 
see
the
ugly
wide
lines
.
 
<EOS>
God
Almighty
ever
bless
you
,
etc
.
  
<EOS>
Faith
,
this
is
a
whole
treatise
;
I
'll
go
reckon
the
lines
on
the
other
sides
.
<EOS>
I
've
reckoned
them

LETTER
6
.
 
<EOS>
LONDON
,
Oct.
10
,
1710
.
  
<EOS>
So
,
as
I
told
you
just
now
in
the
letter
I
sent
half
an
hour
ago
,
I
dined
with
Mr.
Harley
to
-
day
,
who
presented
me
to
the
Attorney
-
General
,
Sir
Simon
Harcourt
,
with
much
compliment
on
all
sides
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
Harley
told
me
he
had
shown
my
memorial
to
the
Queen
,
and
seconded
it
very
heartily
;
and
he
desires
me
to
dine
with
him
again
on
Sunday
,
when
he
promises
to
settle
it
with
Her
Majesty
,
before
she
names
a
Governor
:
and
I
protest
I
am
in
hopes
it
will
be
done
,
<EOS>
all
but
the
forms
,
by
that
time
;
for
he
loves
the
Church
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
a
popular
thing
,
and
he
would
not
have
a
Governor
share
in
it
;
and
,
besides
,
I
am
told
by
all
hands
,
he
has
a
mind
to
gain
me
over
.
 
<EOS>
But
in
the
letter
I
writ
last
post
(
yesterday
)
<EOS>
to
the
Archbishop
,
I
did
not
tell
him
a
syllable
of
what
Mr.
Harley
said
to
me
last
night
,
because
he
charged
me
to
keep
it
secret
;
so
I
would
not
tell
it
to
you
,
but
that
,
before
this
goes
,
I
hope
the
secret
will
be
over
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
now
writing
my
poetical
"
Description
of
a
Shower
in
London
,
"
and
will
send
it
to
the
Tatler
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
the
last
sheet
of
a
whole
quire
I
have
written
since
I
came
to
town
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
,
now
it
comes
into
my
head
,
will
you
,
when
you
go
to
Mrs.
Walls
,
contrive
to
know
whether
Mrs.
Wesley
be
in
town
,
and
still
at
her
brother
's
,
and
how
she
is
in
health
,
and
whether
she
stays
in
town
.
 
<EOS>
I
writ
to
her
from
Chester
,
to
know
what
I
should
do
with
her
note
;
and
I
believe
the
poor
woman
is
afraid
to
write
to
me
:
 
<EOS>
so
I
must
go
to
my
business
,
etc
.
  
<EOS>
11
.
 
<EOS>
To
-
day
at
last
<EOS>
I
dined
with
Lord
Mountrath
,
and
carried
Lord
Mountjoy
,
and
Sir
Andrew
Fountaine
with
me
;
and
was
looking
over
them
at
ombre
till
eleven
this
evening
like
a
fool
:
 
<EOS>
they
played
running
ombre
half
-
crowns
;
and
Sir
Andrew
Fountaine
won
eight
guineas
of
Mr.
Coote
;
so
I
am
come
home
late
,
and
will
say
but
little
to
MD
this
night
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
gotten
half
a
bushel
of
coals
,
and
Patrick
,
the
extravagant
whelp
,
had
a
fire
ready
for
me
;
but
I
picked
off
the
coals
before
I
went
to
bed
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
a
sign
London
is
now
an
empty
place
,
when
it
will
not
furnish
me
with
matter
for
above
five
or
six
lines
in
a
day
.
 
<EOS>
Did
you
smoke
in
my
last
how
I
told
you
the
very
day
and
the
place
you
were
playing
at
ombre
?
 
<EOS>
But
I
interlined
and
altered
a
little
,
after
I
had
received
a
letter
from
Mr.
Manley
<EOS>
,
that
said
you
were
at
it
in
his
house
,
while
he
was
writing
to
me
;
but
without
his
help
I
guessed
within
one
day
.
 
<EOS>
Your
town
is
certainly
much
more
sociable
than
ours
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
seen
your
mother
yet
,
etc
.
  
<EOS>
12
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
to
-
day
with
Dr.
Garth
and
Mr.
Addison
,
at
the
Devil
Tavern
by
Temple
Bar
,
and
Garth
treated
;
and
'
tis
<EOS>
well
I
dine
every
day
,
else
I
should
be
longer
making
out
my
letters
:
 
<EOS>
for
we
are
yet
in
a
very
dull
state
,
only
inquiring
every
day
after
new
elections
,
where
the
Tories
carry
it
among
the
new
members
six
to
one
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Addison
's
election
has
passed
easy
and
undisputed
;
and
I
believe
if
he
had
a
mind
to
be
chosen
king
,
he
would
hardly
be
refused
.
 
<EOS>
An
odd
accident
has
happened
at
Colchester
:
 
one
Captain
Lavallin
,
coming
from
Flanders
or
Spain
,
found
his
wife
with
child
by
a
clerk
of
Doctors
"
Commons
,
whose
trade
,
you
know
,
it
is
to
prevent
fornications
:
 
and
this
clerk
was
the
very
same
fellow
that
made
the
discovery
of
Dyot
's
counterfeiting
the
stamp
-
paper
.
 
<EOS>
Lavallin
has
been
this
fortnight
hunting
after
the
clerk
,
to
kill
him
;
but
the
fellow
was
constantly
employed
at
the
Treasury
,
about
the
discovery
he
made
:
 
<EOS>
the
wife
had
made
a
shift
to
patch
up
the
business
,
alleging
that
the
clerk
had
told
her
her
husband
was
dead
and
other
excuses
;
but
t'other
day
somebody
told
Lavallin
his
wife
had
intrigues
before
he
married
her
:
 
upon
which
he
goes
down
in
a
rage
,
shoots
his
wife
through
the
head
,
then
falls
on
his
sword
;
and
,
to
make
the
matter
sure
,
at
the
same
time
discharges
a
pistol
through
his
own
head
,
and
died
on
the
spot
,
his
wife
surviving
him
about
two
hours
,
but
in
what
circumstances
of
mind
and
body
is
terrible
to
imagine
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
finished
my
poem
on
the
"
Shower
,
"
all
but
the
beginning
;
and
am
going
on
with
my
Tatler
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
fixed
about
fifty
things
on
me
since
I
came
:
 
<EOS>
I
have
printed
but
three
.
<EOS>
One
advantage
I
get
by
writing
to
you
daily
,
or
rather
you
get
,
is
,
that
I
shall
remember
not
to
write
the
same
things
twice
;
and
yet
,
I
fear
,
I
have
done
it
often
already
:
 
<EOS>
but
I
will
mind
and
confine
myself
to
the
accidents
of
the
day
;
and
so
get
you
gone
to
ombre
,
and
be
good
girls
,
and
save
your
money
,
and
be
rich
against
Presto
comes
,
and
write
to
me
now
and
then
:
 
<EOS>
I
am
thinking
it
would
be
a
pretty
thing
to
hear
sometimes
from
saucy
MD
;
but
do
not
hurt
your
eyes
,
<EOS>
Stella
,
I
charge
you
.
  
<EOS>

.
 
<EOS>
O
Lord
,
here
is
but
a
trifle
of
my
letter
written
yet
;
what
shall
Presto
do
for
prattle
-
prattle
,
to
entertain
MD
?
 
<EOS>
The
talk
now
grows
fresher
of
the
Duke
of
Ormond
for
Ireland
;
though
Mr.
Addison
says
he
hears
it
will
be
in
commission
,
and
Lord
Galway
one
.
 
<EOS>
These
letters
of
mine
are
a
sort
of
journal
,
where
matters
open
by
degrees
;
and
,
as
I
tell
true
or
false
,
you
will
find
by
the
event
whether
my
intelligence
be
good
;
but
I
do
not
care
twopence
whether
it
be
or
no
.
 
<EOS>
At
night
.
 
<EOS>
To
-
day
I
was
all
about
St.
Paul
's
,
and
up
at
the
top
like
a
fool
,
with
Sir
Andrew
Fountaine
and
two
more
;
and
spent
seven
shillings
for
my
dinner
like
a
puppy
:
 
<EOS>
this
is
the
second
time
he
has
served
me
so
;
but
I
will
never
do
it
again
,
though
all
mankind
should
persuade
me
,
unconsidering
puppies
!
 
<EOS>
There
is
a
young
fellow
here
in
town
<EOS>
we
are
all
fond
of
,
and
about
a
year
or
two
come
from
the
University
,
<EOS>
one
Harrison
,
a
little
pretty
fellow
,
with
a
great
deal
of
wit
,
good
sense
,
and
good
nature
;
has
written
some
mighty
pretty
things
;
that
in
your
6th
Miscellanea
,
about
the
Sprig
of
an
Orange
,
is
his
:
 
<EOS>
he
has
nothing
to
live
on
but
being
governor
to
one
of
the
Duke
of
Queensberry
's
sons
for
forty
pounds
a
year
.
 
<EOS>
The
fine
fellows
are
always
inviting
him
to
the
tavern
,
and
make
him
pay
his
club
.
<EOS>
Henley
is
a
great
crony
of
his
:
 
<EOS>
they
are
often
at
the
tavern
at
six
or
seven
shillings
reckoning
,
and
he
always
makes
the
poor
lad
pay
his
full
share
.
 
<EOS>
A
colonel
and
a
lord
were
at
him
and
me
the
same
way
to
-
night
:
 
<EOS>
I
absolutely
refused
,
and
made
Harrison
lag
behind
,
and
persuaded
him
not
to
go
to
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
you
this
,
because
I
find
all
rich
fellows
have
that
humour
of
using
all
people
without
any
consideration
of
their
fortunes
;
but
I
will
see
them
rot
before
they
shall
serve
me
so
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Halifax
is
always
teasing
me
to
go
down
to
his
country
house
,
which
will
cost
me
a
guinea
to
his
servants
,
and
twelve
shillings
coach
-
hire
;
and
he
shall
be
hanged
first
.
 
<EOS>
Is
not
this
a
plaguy
silly
story
?
 
<EOS>
But
I
am
vexed
at
the
heart
;
for
I
love
the
young
fellow
,
and
am
resolved
to
stir
up
people
to
do
something
for
him
:
 
<EOS>
he
is
a
Whig
,
and
I
will
put
him
upon
some
of
my
cast
Whigs
;
for
I
have
done
with
them
;
and
they
have
,
I
hope
,
done
with
this
kingdom
for
our
time
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
sure
of
the
four
members
for
London
above
all
places
,
and
they
have
lost
three
in
the
four
.
<EOS>
Sir
Richard
Onslow
,
we
hear
,
has
lost
for
Surrey
;
and
they
are
overthrown
in
most
places
.
 
<EOS>
Lookee
,
gentlewomen
,
if
I
write
long
letters
,
I
must
write
you
news
and
stuff
,
unless
I
send
you
my
verses
;
and
some
I
dare
not
;
and
those
on
the
"
Shower
in
London
<EOS>
"
I
have
sent
to
the
Tatler
,
and
you
may
see
them
in
Ireland
.
 
<EOS>
I
fancy
<EOS>
you
will
smoke
me
in
the
Tatler
I
am
going
to
write
;
<EOS>
for
I
believe
I
have
told
you
the
hint
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
a
letter
sent
me
tonight
from
Sir
Matthew
Dudley
,
and
found
it
on
my
table
when
I
came
in
.
 
<EOS>
Because
it
is
extraordinary
,
I
will
transcribe
it
from
beginning
to
end
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
as
follows
:
<EOS>
"
Is
the
Devil
in
you
?
 
<EOS>
Oct.
13
,
1710
.
<EOS>
"
 
I
would
have
answered
every
particular
passage
in
it
,
only
I
wanted
time
.
 
<EOS>
Here
is
enough
for
to
-
night
,
such
as
it
is
,
etc
.
  
<EOS>
14
.
 
<EOS>
Is
that
tobacco
at
the
top
of
the
paper
,
or
what
?
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
remember
I
slobbered
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
,
I
dreamt
of
Stella
,
etc
.
,
so
confusedly
last
night
,
and
that
we
saw
Dean
Bolton
and
Sterne
go
into
a
shop
:
 
<EOS>
and
she
bid
me
call
them
to
her
,
and
they
proved
to
be
two
parsons
<EOS>
I
know
not
;
and
I
walked
without
till
she
was
shifting
,
and
such
stuff
,
mixed
with
much
melancholy
and
uneasiness
,
and
things
not
as
they
should
be
,
and
<EOS>
I
know
not
how
:
 
and
it
is
now
an
ugly
gloomy
morning
.
 
<EOS>
At
night
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Addison
and
I
dined
with
Ned
Southwell
,
and
walked
in
the
Park
;
and
at
the
Coffee
-
house
I
found
a
letter
from
the
Bishop
of
Clogher
,
and
a
packet
from
MD
.
 
<EOS>
I
opened
the
Bishop
's
letter
;
but
put
up
MD
's
,
and
visited
a
lady
just
come
to
town
;
and
am
now
got
into
bed
,
and
going
to
open
your
little
letter
:
 
and
God
send
<EOS>
I
may
find
MD
well
,
and
happy
,
and
merry
,
and
that
they
love
Presto
as
they
do
fires
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
I
will
not
open
it
yet
!
<EOS>
yes
I
will
!
<EOS>
no
I
will
not
!
 
<EOS>
I
am
going
<EOS>
;
I
can
not
stay
till
I
turn
over
.
 
<EOS>
What
shall
I
do
?
 
<EOS>
My
fingers
itch
;
and
now
I
have
it
in
my
left
hand
;
and
now
I
will
open
it
this
very
moment
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
just
got
it
,
and
am
cracking
the
seal
,
and
can
not
imagine
what
is
in
it
;
I
fear
only
some
letter
from
a
bishop
,
and
it
comes
too
late
;
I
shall
employ
nobody
's
credit
but
my
own
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
I
see
though
  
<EOS>
Pshaw
,
'
tis
from
Sir
Andrew
Fountaine
.
<EOS>
What
,
another
!
 
<EOS>
I
fancy
<EOS>
that
's
from
Mrs.
Barton
;
she
told
me
she
would
write
to
me
;
but
she
writes
a
better
hand
than
this
:
 
I
wish
you
would
inquire
;
it
must
be
at
Dawson
's
office
at
the
Castle
.
 
<EOS>
I
fear
this
is
from
Patty
Rolt
,
by
the
scrawl
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
I
will
read
MD
's
letter
.
 
<EOS>
Ah
,
no
;
it
is
from
poor
Lady
Berkeley
,
to
invite
me
to
Berkeley
Castle
this
winter
;
and
now
it
grieves
my
heart
:
 
<EOS>
she
says
,
she
hopes
my
lord
is
in
a
fair
way
of
recovery
;
poor
lady
!
<EOS>
Well
,
now
I
go
to
MD
's
letter
:
 
<EOS>
faith
,
it
is
all
right
;
I
hoped
it
was
wrong
.
 
<EOS>
Your
letter
,
N.3
,
that
I
have
now
received
,
is
dated
Sept.
26
;
and
Manley
's
letter
,
that
I
had
five
days
ago
,
was
dated
Oct.
3
,
that
's
a
fortnight
difference
:
 
<EOS>
I
doubt
it
has
lain
in
Steele
's
office
,
and
he
forgot
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
there
's
an
end
of
that
:
 
<EOS>
he
is
turned
out
of
his
place
;
and
you
must
desire
those
who
send
me
packets
,
to
enclose
them
in
a
paper
directed
to
Mr.
Addison
,
at
St.
James
's
Coffee
-
house
:
 
not
common
letters
,
but
packets
:
 
<EOS>
the
Bishop
of
Clogher
may
mention
it
to
the
Archbishop
when
he
sees
him
.
 
<EOS>
As
for
your
letter
,
it
makes
me
mad
:
 
slidikins
,
I
have
been
the
best
boy
in
Christendom
,
and
<EOS>
you
come
with
your
two
eggs
a
penny
.
 
<EOS>
Well
;
but
stay
,
I
will
look
over
my
book
:
 
adad
<EOS>
,
I
think
there
was
a
chasm
between
my
N.2
and
N.3
.
 
<EOS>
Faith
,
I
will
not
promise
to
write
to
you
every
week
;
but
I
will
write
every
night
,
and
when
it
is
full
I
will
send
it
;
that
will
be
once
in
ten
days
,
and
that
will
be
often
enough
:
 
and
if
you
begin
to
take
up
the
way
of
writing
to
Presto
,
only
because
it
is
Tuesday
,
a
Monday
bedad
it
will
grow
a
task
;
but
write
when
you
have
a
mind
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
no
,
no
,
no

no

no

no

no
 
Agad

poor
Stellakins

<EOS>
Slids
,
I
would
the
horse
were
in
your
 
chamber
!
 
<EOS>
Have
not
I
ordered
Parvisol
to
obey
your
directions
about
him
?
 
<EOS>
And
han't
<EOS>
I
said
in
my
former
letters
that
you
may
pickle
him
,
and
boil
him
,
if
you
will
?
 
<EOS>
What
do
you
trouble
me
about
your
horses
for
?
 
<EOS>
Have
I
anything
to
do
with
them
?
 
<EOS>
Revolutions
a
hindrance
to
me
in
my
business
?
 
<EOS>
Revolutions
to
me
in
my
business
?
 
<EOS>
If
it
were
not
for
the
revolutions
,
I
could
do
nothing
at
all
;
and
now
I
have
all
hopes
possible
,
though
one
is
certain
of
nothing
;
but
to
-
morrow
<EOS>
I
am
to
have
an
answer
,
and
am
promised
an
effectual
one
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
I
have
said
enough
in
this
and
a
former
letter
how
I
stand
with
new
people
;
ten
times
better
than
ever
I
did
with
the
old
;
forty
times
more
caressed
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
to
dine
to
-
morrow
at
Mr.
Harley
's
;
and
if
he
continues
as
he
has
begun
,
no
man
has
been
ever
better
treated
by
another
.
 
<EOS>
What
you
say
about
Stella
's
mother
,
I
have
spoken
enough
to
it
already
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
she
is
not
in
town
;
for
I
have
not
yet
seen
her
.
 
<EOS>
My
lampoon
is
cried
up
to
the
skies
;
but
nobody
suspects
me
for
it
,
except
Sir
Andrew
Fountaine
:
 
at
least
they
say
nothing
of
it
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
Did
not
I
tell
you
of
a
great
man
who
received
me
very
coldly
?
 
<EOS>
That
's
he
;
but
say
nothing
;
'
<EOS>
twas
only
a
little
revenge
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
remember
to
bring
it
over
.
 
<EOS>
The
Bishop
of
Clogher
has
smoked
my
Tatler
,
about
shortening
of
words
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
God
So
!
etc
.
  
<EOS>
15
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
write
plainer
if
I
can
remember
it
;
for
Stella
must
not
spoil
her
eyes
,
and
Dingley
ca
n't
read
my
hand
very
well
;
and
I
am
afraid
my
letters
are
too
long
:
 
<EOS>
then
you
must
suppose
one
to
be
two
,
and
read
them
at
twice
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
to
-
day
with
Mr.
Harley
:
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Prior
dined
with
us
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
left
my
memorial
with
the
Queen
,
who
has
consented
to
give
the
First
-
Fruits
and
Twentieth
Parts
,
and
will
,
we
hope
,
declare
it
to
-
morrow
in
the
Cabinet
.
<EOS>
But
I
beg
you
to
tell
it
to
no
person
alive
;
for
so
I
am
ordered
,
till
in
public
:
 
<EOS>
and
I
hope
to
get
something
of
greater
value
.
 
<EOS>
After
dinner
came
in
Lord
Peterborow
:
 
<EOS>
we
renewed
our
acquaintance
,
and
he
grew
mightily
fond
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
They
began
to
talk
of
a
paper
of
verses
called
"
Sid
Hamet
.
"
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Harley
repeated
part
,
and
then
pulled
them
out
,
and
gave
them
to
a
gentleman
at
the
table
to
read
,
though
they
had
all
read
them
often
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Peterborow
would
let
nobody
read
them
but
himself
:
 
<EOS>
so
he
did
;
and
Mr.
Harley
bobbed
me
at
every
line
,
to
take
notice
of
the
beauties
.
 
<EOS>
Prior
rallied
Lord
Peterborow
for
author
of
them
;
and
Lord
Peterborow
said
he
knew
them
to
be
his
;
and
Prior
then
turned
it
upon
me
,
and
I
on
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
guessed
at
all
in
town
to
be
the
author
;
yet
so
it
is
:
 
<EOS>
but
that
is
a
secret
only
to
you
.
<EOS>
Ten
to
one
whether
you
see
them
in
Ireland
;
yet
here
they
run
prodigiously
.
<EOS>
Harley
presented
me
to
Lord
President
of
Scotland
,
and
Mr.
Benson
,
Lord
of
the
Treasury
.
 
<EOS>
Prior
<EOS>
and
I
came
away
at
nine
,
and
sat
at
the
Smyrna
till
eleven
,
receiving
acquaintance
.
  
<EOS>
16
.
 
<EOS>
This
morning
early
I
went
in
a
chair
,
and
Patrick
before
it
,
to
Mr.
Harley
,
to
give
him
another
copy
of
my
memorial
,
as
he
desired
;
but
he
was
full
of
business
,
going
to
the
Queen
,
and
I
could
not
see
him
;
but
he
desired
I
would
send
up
the
paper
,
and
excused
himself
upon
his
hurry
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
a
little
baulked
;
but
they
tell
me
it
is
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
judge
by
next
visit
.
 
<EOS>
I
tipped
his
porter
with
half
a
crown
;
and
so
I
am
well
there
for
a
time
at
least
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
at
Stratford
's
in
the
City
,
and
had
Burgundy
and
Tokay
:
 
came
back
afoot
like
a
scoundrel
:
 
<EOS>
then
went
with
Mr.
Addison
and
supped
with
Lord
Mountjoy
,
which
made
me
sick
all
night
.
 
<EOS>
I
forgot
that
I
bought
six
pounds
of
chocolate
for
Stella
,
and
a
little
wooden
box
;
and
I
have
a
great
piece
of
Brazil
tobacco
for
Dingley
,
and
a
bottle
of
palsy
-
water
for
Stella
:
all
which
,
with
the
two
handkerchiefs
that
Mr.
Sterne
has
bought
,
and
you
must
pay
him
for
,
will
be
put
in
the
box
,
directed
to
Mrs.
Curry
's
,
and
sent
by
Dr.
Hawkshaw
,
whom
I
have
not
seen
;
but
Sterne
has
undertaken
it
.
 
<EOS>
The
chocolate
is
a
present
,
madam
,
for
Stella
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
read
this
,
you
little
rogue
,
with
your
little
eyes
;
but
give
it
to
Dingley
,
pray
now
;
and
I
will
write
as
plain
as
the
skies
:
 
and
let
Dingley
write
Stella
's
part
,
and
Stella
dictate
to
her
,
when
she
apprehends
her
eyes
,
etc
.
  
<EOS>

<EOS>
This
letter
should
have
gone
this
post
,
if
I
had
not
been
taken
up
with
business
,
and
two
nights
being
late
out
;
so
it
must
stay
till
Thursday
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
to
-
day
with
your
Mr.
Sterne
,
by
invitation
,
and
drank
Irish
wine
;
but
,
<EOS>
before
we
parted
,
there
came
in
the
prince
of
puppies
,
Colonel
Edgworth
;
so
I
went
away
.
 
<EOS>
This
day
came
out
the
Tatler
,
made
up
wholly
of
my
"
Shower
,
"
and
a
preface
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
They
say
it
is
the
best
thing
I
ever
writ
,
and
I
think
so
too
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
the
Bishop
of
Clogher
will
show
it
you
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
tell
me
how
you
like
it
.
 
<EOS>
Tooke
is
going
on
with
my
Miscellany
.
<EOS>
I
'd
give
a
penny
the
letter
to
the
Bishop
of
Killaloe
<EOS>
was
in
it
:
  
'
<EOS>
twould
do
him
honour
.
 
<EOS>
Could
not
you
contrive
to
say
,
you
hear
they
are
printing
my
things
together
;
and
that
you
with
the
bookseller
had
that
letter
among
the
rest
:
but
do
n't
say
anything
of
it
as
from
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
forget
whether
it
was
good
or
no
;
but
only
having
heard
it
much
commended
,
perhaps
it
may
deserve
it
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
I
have
to
-
morrow
to
finish
this
letter
in
,
and
then
I
will
send
it
next
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
so
vexed
that
you
should
write
your
third
to
me
,
when
you
had
but
<EOS>
my
second
,
and
<EOS>
I
had
written
five
,
which
now
I
hope
you
have
all
:
 
<EOS>
and
so
I
tell
you
,
you
are
saucy
,
<EOS>
little
,
pretty
,
dear
rogues
,
etc
.
  
<EOS>

<EOS>
To
-
day
I
dined
,
by
invitation
,
with
Stratford
and
others
,
at
a
young
merchant
's
in
the
City
,
with
Hermitage
and
Tokay
,
and
stayed
till
nine
,
and
am
now
come
home
.
 
<EOS>
And
that
dog
Patrick
is
abroad
,
and
drinking
,
and
I
can
not
I
get
my
night
-
gown
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
mind
to
turn
that
puppy
away
:
 
<EOS>
he
has
been
drunk
ten
times
in
three
weeks
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
han't
time
to
say
more
;
so
good
-
night
,
etc
.
  
<EOS>
19
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
come
home
from
dining
in
the
city
with
Mr.
Addison
,
at
a
merchant
's
;
and
just
now
,
at
the
Coffee
-
house
<EOS>
,
we
have
notice
that
the
Duke
of
Ormond
was
this
day
declared
Lord
Lieutenant
at
Hampton
Court
,
in
Council
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
seen
Mr.
Harley
since
;
but
hope
the
affair
is
done
about
First
-
Fruits
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
see
him
,
if
possible
,
to
-
morrow
morning
;
but
this
goes
to
-
night
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
sent
a
box
to
Mr.
Sterne
,
to
send
to
you
by
some
friend
:
 
<EOS>
I
have
directed
it
for
Mr.
Curry
,
at
his
house
;
<EOS>
so
you
have
warning
when
it
comes
,
as
I
hope
it
will
soon
.
 
<EOS>
The
handkerchiefs
will
be
put
in
some
friend
's
pocket
,
not
to
pay
custom
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
here
ends
my
sixth
,
sent
when
I
had
<EOS>
but
three
of
MD
's
:
 
<EOS>
now
I
am
beforehand
,
and
will
keep
so
;
and
God
Almighty
bless
dearest
MD
,

LETTER

.
 
<EOS>
LONDON
,
Oct.
19
,
1710
.
  
<EOS>
Faith
,
I
am
undone
!
<EOS>
this
paper
is
larger
than
the
other
,
and
yet
I
am
condemned
to
a
sheet
;
but
,
since
it
is
MD
,
I
did
not
value
though
I
were
condemned
to
a
pair
.
 
<EOS>
I
told
you
in
my
letter
to
-
day
where
I
had
been
,
and
how
the
day
passed
;
and
<EOS>
so
,
etc
.
  
<EOS>
20
.
 
<EOS>
To
-
day
I
went
to
Mr.
Lewis
,
at
the
Secretary
's
office
,
to
know
when
I
might
see
Mr.
Harley
;
and
by
and
by
comes
up
Mr.
Harley
himself
,
and
appoints
me
to
dine
with
him
to
-
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
with
Mrs.
Vanhomrigh
,
and
went
to
wait
on
the
two
Lady
Butlers
;
but
the
porter
answered
they
were
not
at
home
:
 
the
meaning
was
,
the
youngest
,
Lady
Mary
,
is
to
be
married
to
-
morrow
to
Lord
Ashburnham
,
the
best
match
now
in
England
,
twelve
thousand
pounds
a
year
,
and
abundance
of
money
.
 
<EOS>
Tell
me
how
my
"
Shower
"
is
liked
in
Ireland
:
 
<EOS>
I
never
knew
anything
pass
better
here
.
 
<EOS>
I
spent
the
evening
with
Wortley
Montagu
and
Mr.
Addison
,
over
a
bottle
of
Irish
wine
.
 
<EOS>
Do
they
know
anything
in
Ireland
of
my
greatness
among
the
Tories
?
 
<EOS>
Everybody
reproaches
me
of
it
here
;
but
I
value
them
not
.
 
<EOS>
Have
you
heard
of
the
verses
about
the
"
Rod
of
Sid
Hamet
"
?
 
<EOS>
Say
nothing
of
them
for
your
life
.
 
<EOS>
Hardly
anybody
suspects
me
for
them
;
only
they
think
nobody
but
Prior
or
I
could
write
them
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
doubt
they
have
not
reached
you
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
likewise
a
ballad
full
of
puns
on
the
Westminster
Election
,
that
cost
me
half
an
hour
:
 
<EOS>
it
runs
,
though
it
be
good
for
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
But
this
is
likewise
a
secret
to
all
but
MD
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
have
them
not
,
I
will
bring
them
over
.
  
<EOS>
21
.
 
<EOS>
I
got
MD
's
fourth
to
-
day
at
the
Coffee
-
house
.
 
<EOS>
God
Almighty
bless
poor
,
dear
Stella
,
and
her
eyes
and
head
!
 
<EOS>
What
shall
we
do
to
cure
them
?
<EOS>
poor
,
dear
life
!
 
<EOS>
Your
disorders
are
a
pull
-
back
for
your
good
qualities
.
 
<EOS>
Would
to
Heaven
<EOS>
I
were
this
minute
shaving
your
poor
,
dear
head
,
<EOS>
either
here
or
there
!
<EOS>
Pray
do
not
write
,
nor
read
this
letter
,
nor
anything
else
;
and
I
will
write
plainer
for
Dingley
to
read
from
henceforward
,
though
my
pen
is
apt
to
ramble
when
I
think
whom
I
am
writing
to
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
not
answer
your
letter
until
I
tell
you
that
I
dined
this
day
with
Mr.
Harley
,
who
presented
me
to
the
Earl
of
Stirling
,
a
Scotch
lord
;
and
in
the
evening
came
in
Lord
Peterborow
.
 
<EOS>
I
stayed
till
nine
before
Mr.
Harley
would
let
me
go
,
or
tell
me
anything
of
my
affair
.
 
<EOS>
He
says
the
Queen
has
now
granted
the
First
-
Fruits
and
Twentieth
Parts
;
but
he
will
not
give
me
leave
to
write
to
the
Archbishop
,
because
the
Queen
designs
to
signify
it
to
the
Bishops
in
Ireland
in
form
;
and
to
take
notice
,
that
it
was
done
upon
a
memorial
from
me
;
which
,
Mr.
Harley
tells
me
he
does
to
make
it
look
more
respectful
to
me
,
etc
.
;
and
I
am
to
see
him
on
Tuesday
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
not
whether
I
told
you
that
,
in
my
memorial
which
was
given
to
the
Queen
,
I
begged
for
two
thousand
pounds
a
year
more
,
though
it
was
not
in
my
commission
;
but
that
,
Mr.
Harley
says
,
can
not
yet
be
done
,
and
that
he
and
I
must
talk
of
it
further
:
 
however
,
I
have
started
it
,
and
it
may
follow
in
time
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
say
nothing
of
the
First
-
Fruits
being
granted
,
unless
I
give
leave
at
the
bottom
of
this
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
never
anything
was
compassed
so
soon
,
and
purely
done
by
my
personal
credit
with
Mr.
Harley
,
who
is
so
excessively
obliging
,
that
I
know
not
what
to
make
of
it
,
unless
to
show
the
rascals
of
the
other
party
that
they
used
a
man
unworthily
who
had
deserved
better
.
 
<EOS>
The
memorial
given
to
the
Queen
from
me
speaks
with
great
plainness
of
Lord
Wharton
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
this
business
is
as
important
to
you
as
the
Convocation
disputes
from
Tisdall
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
in
a
month
or
two
all
the
forms
of
settling
this
matter
will
be
over
;
and
then
I
shall
have
nothing
to
do
here
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
only
add
one
foolish
thing
more
,
because
it
is
just
come
into
my
head
.
 
<EOS>
When
this
thing
is
made
known
,
tell
me
impartially
whether
they
give
any
of
the
merit
to
me
,
or
no
<EOS>
;
for
I
am
sure
I
have
so
much
,
that
I
will
never
take
it
upon
me
.
 
<EOS>
Insolent
sluts
!
<EOS>
because
I
say
Dublin
,
Ireland
,
therefore
you
must
say
London
,
England
:
 
<EOS>
that
is
Stella
's
malice
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
for
that
I
will
not
answer
your
letter
till
to
-
morrow
-
day
,
and
<EOS>
so
and
so
:
 
I
will
go
write
something
else
,
and
it
will
not
be
much
;
for
'
tis
late
.
  
<EOS>
22
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
this
morning
with
Mr.
Lewis
,
the
under
-
secretary
to
Lord
Dartmouth
,
two
hours
,
talking
politics
,
and
contriving
to
keep
Steele
in
his
office
of
stamped
paper
:
 
<EOS>
he
has
lost
his
place
of
Gazetteer
,
three
hundred
pounds
a
year
,
for
writing
a
Tatler
,
some
months
ago
,
against
Mr.
Harley
,
who
gave
it
him
at
first
,
and
raised
the
salary
from
sixty
to
three
hundred
pounds
.
<EOS>
This
was
devilish
ungrateful
;
and
Lewis
was
telling
me
the
particulars
:
 
<EOS>
but
I
had
a
hint
given
me
,
that
I
might
save
him
in
the
other
employment
:
 
and
leave
<EOS>
was
given
me
to
clear
matters
with
Steele
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
I
dined
with
Sir
Matthew
Dudley
,
and
in
the
evening
went
to
sit
with
Mr.
Addison
,
and
offer
the
matter
at
distance
to
him
,
as
the
discreeter
person
;
but
found
party
had
so
possessed
him
,
that
he
talked
as
if
he
suspected
me
,
and
would
not
fall
in
with
anything
I
said
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
stopped
short
in
my
overture
,
and
we
parted
very
drily
;
and
I
shall
say
nothing
to
Steele
,
and
let
them
do
as
they
will
;
but
,
if
things
stand
as
they
are
,
he
will
certainly
lose
it
,
unless
I
save
him
;
and
therefore
I
will
not
speak
to
him
,
that
I
may
not
report
to
his
disadvantage
.
 
<EOS>
Is
not
this
vexatious
?
<EOS>
and
is
there
so
much
in
the
proverb
of
proffered
service
?
<EOS>
When
shall
I
grow
wise
?
 
<EOS>
I
endeavour
to
act
in
the
most
exact
points
of
honour
and
conscience
;
and
my
nearest
friends
will
not
understand
it
so
.
 
<EOS>
What
must
a
man
expect
from
his
enemies
?
 
<EOS>
This
would
vex
me
,
but
it
shall
not
;
and
so
I
bid
you
good
-
night
,
etc
.
  
<EOS>
23
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
'
tis
neither
wit
nor
diversion
to
tell
you
every
day
where
I
dine
;
neither
do
I
write
it
to
fill
my
letter
;
but
<EOS>
I
fancy
I
shall
,
<EOS>
some
time
or
other
,
have
the
curiosity
of
seeing
some
particulars
how
I
passed
my
life
when
I
was
absent
from
MD
this
time
;
and
so
I
tell
you
now
that
I
dined
to
-
day
at
Molesworth
's
,
the
Florence
Envoy
,
then
went
to
the
Coffee
-
house
,
where
I
behaved
myself
coldly
enough
to
Mr.
Addison
,
and
so
came
home
to
scribble
.
 
<EOS>
We
dine
together
to
-
morrow
and
next
day
by
invitation
;
but
I
shall
alter
my
behaviour
to
him
,
till
he
begs
my
pardon
,
or
else
we
shall
grow
bare
acquaintance
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
weary
of
friends
;
and
friendships
are
all
monsters
,
but
MD
's
.
  
<EOS>
24
.
 
<EOS>
I
forgot
to
tell
you
,
that
last
night
I
went
to
Mr.
Harley
's
,
hoping
 
faith
,
I
am
blundering
,
<EOS>
for
it
was
this
very
night
at
six
;
and
I
hoped
he
would
have
told
me
all
things
were
done
and
granted
:
 
<EOS>
but
he
was
abroad
,
and
came
home
ill
,
and
was
gone
to
bed
,
much
out
of
order
,
unless
the
porter
lied
.
<EOS>
I
dined
to
-
day
at
Sir
Matthew
Dudley
's
,
with
Mr.
Addison
,
etc
.
  
<EOS>
25
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
to
-
day
to
see
the
Duke
of
Ormond
;
and
,
coming
out
,
met
Lord
Berkeley
of
Stratton
,
who
told
me
that
Mrs.
Temple
,
the
widow
,
died
last
Saturday
,
which
,
I
suppose
,
is
much
to
the
outward
grief
and
inward
joy
of
the
family
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
to
-
day
with
Addison
and
Steele
,
and
a
sister
of
Mr.
Addison
,
who
is
married
to
one
Mons
.
 
<EOS>
Sartre
,
a
Frenchman
,
prebendary
of
Westminster
,
who
has
a
delicious
house
and
garden
;
yet
<EOS>
I
thought
it
was
a
sort
of
monastic
life
in
those
cloisters
,
and
I
liked
Laracor
better
.
 
<EOS>
Addison
's
sister
is
a
sort
of
a
wit
,
very
like
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
fond
of
her
,
etc
.
  
<EOS>
26
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
to
-
day
to
see
Mr.
Congreve
,
who
is
almost
blind
with
cataracts
growing
on
his
eyes
;
and
his
case
is
,
that
he
must
wait
two
or
three
years
,
until
the
cataracts
are
riper
,
and
till
he
is
quite
blind
,
and
then
he
must
have
them
couched
;
and
,
besides
,
he
is
never
rid
of
the
gout
,
yet
he
looks
young
and
fresh
,
and
is
as
cheerful
as
ever
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
younger
by
three
years
or
more
than
I
;
and
I
am
twenty
years
younger
than
he
.
 
<EOS>
He
gave
me
a
pain
in
the
great
toe
,
by
mentioning
the
gout
.
 
<EOS>
I
find
such
suspicions
frequently
,
but
they
go
off
again
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
a
second
letter
from
Mr.
Morgan
,
for
which
I
thank
you
:
 
<EOS>
I
wish
you
were
whipped
,
for
forgetting
to
send
him
that
answer
<EOS>
I
desired
you
in
one
of
my
former
,
that
I
could
do
nothing
for
him
of
what
he
desired
,
having
no
credit
at
all
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
Go
,
be
far
enough
,
you
negligent
baggages
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
had
also
a
letter
from
Parvisol
,
with
an
account
how
my
livings
are
set
;
and
that
they
are
fallen
,
since
last
year
,
sixty
pounds
.
 
<EOS>
A
comfortable
piece
of
news
!
 
<EOS>
He
tells
me
plainly
that
he
finds
you
have
no
mind
to
part
with
the
horse
,
because
you
sent
for
him
at
the
same
time
you
sent
him
my
letter
;
so
that
I
know
not
what
must
be
done
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
a
sad
thing
that
Stella
must
have
her
own
horse
,
whether
Parvisol
will
or
no
.
 
<EOS>
So
now
to
answer
your
letter
that
I
had
three
or
four
days
ago
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
now
in
bed
,
but
am
come
home
by
eight
;
and
,
it
being
warm
,
I
write
up
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
writ
to
the
Bishop
of
Killala
,
<EOS>
which
,
I
suppose
,
was
the
reason
he
had
not
my
letter
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
time
,
there
is
the
short
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
As
fond
as
the
Dean
is
of
my
letter
,
he
has
not
written
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
only
know
whether
Dean
Bolton
paid
him
the
twenty
pounds
;
and
for
the
rest
,
he
may
kiss
 
And
that
you
may
ask
him
,
because
I
am
in
pain
about
it
,
that
Dean
Bolton
is
such
a
whipster
.
'
<EOS>
Tis
the
most
obliging
thing
in
the
world
in
Dean
Sterne
to
be
so
kind
to
you
.
<EOS>
I
believe
he
knows
it
will
please
me
,
and
makes
up
,
that
way
,
his
other
usage
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
we
have
had
none
of
your
snow
,
but
a
little
one
morning
;
yet
I
think
it
was
great
snow
for
an
hour
or
so
,
but
no
longer
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
heard
of
Will
Crowe
's
death
before
,
but
not
the
foolish
circumstance
that
hastened
his
end
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
I
have
taken
care
that
Captain
Pratt
shall
not
suffer
by
Lord
Anglesea
's
death
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
try
some
contrivance
to
get
a
copy
of
my
picture
from
Jervas
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
make
Sir
Andrew
Fountaine
buy
one
as
for
himself
,
and
I
will
pay
him
again
,
and
take
it
,
that
is
,
provided
I
have
money
to
spare
when
I
leave
this
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
John
!
<EOS>
is
he
gone
?
<EOS>
and
Madam
Parvisol
has
been
in
town
!
<EOS>
Humm
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
Tighe
and
I
,
when
he
comes
,
shall
not
take
any
notice
of
each
other
;
I
would
not
do
it
much
in
this
town
,
though
we
had
not
fallen
out
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
to
-
day
at
Mr.
Sterne
's
lodging
:
 
<EOS>
he
was
not
within
;
and
Mr.
Leigh
is
not
come
to
town
;
but
I
will
do
Dingley
's
errand
when
I
see
him
.
 
<EOS>
What
do
I
know
whether
china
be
dear
or
no
?
 
<EOS>
I
once
took
a
fancy
of
resolving
to
grow
mad
for
it
,
but
now
it
is
off
;
I
suppose
I
told
you
in
some
former
letter
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
you
only
want
some
salad
-
dishes
,
and
plates
,
and
etc
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
yes
,
you
shall
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
you
have
named
as
much
as
will
cost
five
pounds
.
 
<EOS>
Now
to
Stella
's
little
postscript
;
and
I
am
almost
crazed
that
you
vex
yourself
for
not
writing
.
 
<EOS>
Can
not
you
dictate
to
Dingley
,
and
not
strain
your
little
,
dear
eyes
?
 
<EOS>
I
am
sure
it
is
the
grief
of
my
soul
to
think
you
are
out
of
order
.
<EOS>
Pray
be
quiet
;
and
,
if
you
will
write
,
shut
your
eyes
,
and
write
just
a
line
,
and
no
more
,
thus
,
"
How
do
you
do
,
Mrs.
Stella
?
"
 
<EOS>
That
was
written
with
<EOS>
my
eyes
shut
.
 
<EOS>
Faith
,
I
think
it
is
better
than
when
they
are
open
:
 
and
then
Dingley
may
stand
by
,
and
tell
you
when
you
go
too
high
or
too
low
.
 
<EOS>
My
letters
of
business
,
with
packets
,
if
there
be
any
more
occasion
for
such
,
must
be
enclosed
to
Mr.
Addison
,
at
St.
James
's
Coffee
-
house
:
 
<EOS>
but
I
hope
to
hear
,
as
soon
as
I
see
Mr.
Harley
,
that
the
main
difficulties
are
over
,
and
that
the
rest
will
be
but
form
.
 
<EOS>
Take
two
or
three
nutgalls
,
take
two
or
three
  
g
alls
,
stop
your
receipt
in
your
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
need
on't
.
 
<EOS>
Here
is
a
clutter
!
<EOS>
Well
,
so
much
for
your
letter
,
which
I
will
now
put
up
in
my
letter
-
partition
in
my
cabinet
,
as
I
always
do
every
letter
as
soon
as
I
answer
it
.
 
<EOS>
Method
is
good
in
all
things
.
 
<EOS>
Order
governs
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
The
Devil
is
the
author
of
confusion
.
 
<EOS>
A
general
of
an
army
,
a
minister
of
state
;
to
descend
lower
,
a
gardener
,
a
weaver
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
That
may
make
a
fine
observation
,
if
you
think
it
worth
finishing
;
but
I
have
not
time
.
 
<EOS>
Is
not
this
a
terrible
long
piece
for
one
evening
?
 
<EOS>
I
dined
to
-
day
with
Patty
Rolt
at
my
cousin
Leach
's
,
with
a
pox
,
in
the
City
:
 
<EOS>
he
is
a
printer
,
and
prints
the
Postman
,
oh
hoo
,
and
is
my
cousin
,
God
knows
<EOS>
how
,
and
he
married
Mrs.
Baby
Aires
of
Leicester
;
and
my
cousin
Thomson
was
with
us
:
 
and
my
cousin
Leach
offers
to
bring
me
acquainted
with
the
author
of
the
Postman
;
and
<EOS>
says
he
does
not
doubt
<EOS>
but
the
gentleman
will
be
glad
of
my
acquaintance
;
and
that
he
is
a
very
ingenious
man
,
and
a
great
scholar
,
and
has
been
beyond
sea
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
was
modest
and
said
,
may
be
the
gentleman
was
shy
,
and
not
fond
of
new
acquaintance
;
and
so
put
it
off
:
 
<EOS>
and
I
wish
you
could
hear
me
repeating
all
I
have
said
of
this
in
its
proper
tone
,
just
as
I
am
writing
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
all
with
the
same
cadence
with
"
Oh
hoo
,
"
or
as
when
little
girls
say
,
"
I
have
got
an
apple
,
miss
,
and
I
wo
n't
give
you
some
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
It
is
plaguy
twelvepenny
weather
this
last
week
,
and
has
cost
me
ten
shillings
in
coach
and
chair
hire
.
 
<EOS>
If
the
fellow
that
has
your
money
will
pay
it
,
let
me
beg
you
to
buy
Bank
Stock
with
it
,
which
is
fallen
near
thirty
per
cent
.
<EOS>
and
pays
eight
pounds
per
cent
.
<EOS>
and
you
have
the
principal
when
you
please
:
 
<EOS>
it
will
certainly
soon
rise
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
to
God
Lady
Giffard
would
put
in
the
four
hundred
pounds
she
owes
you
,
and
take
the
five
per
cent
.
<EOS>
common
interest
,
and
give
you
the
remainder
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
speak
to
your
mother
about
it
when
I
see
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
resolved
to
buy
three
hundred
pounds
of
it
for
myself
,
and
take
up
what
I
have
in
Ireland
;
and
I
have
a
contrivance
for
it
,
that
I
hope
will
do
,
by
making
a
friend
of
mine
buy
it
as
for
himself
,
and
I
will
pay
him
when
I
can
get
in
my
money
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
Stratford
will
do
me
that
kindness
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
ask
him
tomorrow
or
next
day
.

<EOS>
Mr.
Rowe
the
poet
desired
me
to
dine
with
him
to
-
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
went
to
his
office
<EOS>
(
he
is
under
-
secretary
in
Mr.
Addison
's
place
that
he
had
in
England
)
,
and
there
was
Mr.
Prior
;
and
they
both
fell
commending
my
"
Shower
"
beyond
anything
that
has
been
written
of
the
kind
:
 
there
never
was
such
a
"
Shower
"
since
Danae
's
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
You
must
tell
me
how
it
is
liked
among
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
with
Rowe
;
Prior
could
not
come
:
 
and
after
dinner
we
went
to
a
blind
tavern
,
where
Congreve
,
Sir
Richard
Temple
,
Estcourt
,
and
Charles
Main
,
were
over
a
bowl
of
bad
punch
.
 
<EOS>
The
knight
sent
for
six
flasks
of
his
own
wine
for
me
,
and
we
stayed
till
twelve
.
 
<EOS>
But
now
my
head
continues
pretty
well
;
I
have
left
off
my
drinking
,
and
only
take
a
spoonful
mixed
with
water
,
for
fear
of
the
gout
,
or
some
ugly
distemper
;
and
now
,
because
it
is
late
,
I
will
,
etc
.
  
<EOS>
28
.
 
<EOS>
Garth
and
Addison
<EOS>
and
I
dined
to
-
day
at
a
hedge
tavern
;
then
I
went
to
Mr.
Harley
,
but
he
was
denied
,
or
not
at
home
:
 
<EOS>
so
I
fear
I
shall
not
hear
my
business
is
done
before
this
goes
.
 
<EOS>
Then
I
visited
Lord
Pembroke
,
who
is
just
come
to
town
;
and
we
were
very
merry
talking
of
old
things
;
and
I
hit
him
with
one
pun
.
 
<EOS>
Then
I
went
to
see
the
Ladies
Butler
,
and
the
son
of
a
whore
of
a
porter
denied
them
:
 
<EOS>
so
I
sent
them
a
threatening
message
by
another
lady
,
for
not
excepting
me
always
to
the
porter
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
weary
of
the
Coffee
-
house
,
and
Ford
desired
me
to
sit
with
him
at
next
door
;
which
I
did
,
like
a
fool
,
chatting
till
twelve
,
and
now
am
got
into
bed
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
afraid
the
new
Ministry
is
at
a
terrible
loss
about
money
:
 
<EOS>
the
Whigs
talk
<EOS>
so
,
it
would
give
one
the
spleen
;
and
I
am
afraid
of
meeting
Mr.
Harley
out
of
humour
.
 
<EOS>
They
think
he
will
never
carry
through
this
undertaking
.
 
<EOS>
God
knows
what
will
come
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
be
terribly
vexed
to
see
things
come
round
again
:
 
<EOS>
it
will
ruin
the
Church
and
clergy
for
ever
;
but
I
hope
for
better
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
send
this
on
Tuesday
,
whether
I
hear
any
further
news
of
my
affair
or
not
.
  
<EOS>

<EOS>
Mr.
Addison
and
I
dined
to
-
day
with
Lord
Mountjoy
;
which
is
all
the
adventures
of
this
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
chatted
a
while
to
-
night
in
the
Coffee
-
house
,
this
being
a
full
night
;
and
now
am
come
home
,
to
write
some
business
.
  
<EOS>
30
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
to
-
day
at
Mrs.
Vanhomrigh
's
,
and
sent
a
letter
to
poor
Mrs.
Long
,
who
writes
to
us
,
but
is
God
knows
where
,
and
will
not
tell
anybody
the
place
of
her
residence
.
 
<EOS>
I
came
home
early
,
and
must
go
write
.
  
<EOS>
31
.
 
<EOS>
The
month
ends
with
a
fine
day
;
and
I
have
been
walking
,
and
visiting
Lewis
,
and
concerting
where
to
see
Mr.
Harley
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
news
to
send
you
.
<EOS>
Aire
,
they
say
,
is
taken
,
though
the
Whitehall
letters
this
morning
say
quite
the
contrary
:
 
'
tis
good
,
if
it
be
true
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
with
Mr.
Addison
and
Dick
Stewart
,
Lord
Mountjoy
's
brother
;
a
treat
of
Addison
's
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
half
-
fuddled
,
but
not
I
;
for
I
mixed
water
with
my
wine
,
and
left
them
together
between
nine
and
ten
;
and
I
must
send
this
by
the
bellman
,
which
vexes
me
,
but
I
will
put
it
off
no
longer
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
God
it
does
not
miscarry
.
 
<EOS>
I
seldom
do
so
;
but
I
can
put
off
little
MD
no
longer
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
give
the
under
note
to
Mrs.
Brent
.
  
<EOS>
I
am
a
pretty
gentleman
;
and
you
lose
all
your
money
at
cards
,
sirrah
Stella
.
<EOS>
I
found
you
out
;
I
did
so
.
  
<EOS>
I
am
staying
before
I
can
fold
up
this
letter
,
till
that
ugly
D
is
dry
in
the
last
line
but
one
.
 
<EOS>
Do
not
you
see
it
?
 
<EOS>
O
Lord
,
I
am
loth
to
leave
you
,
faith
 
<EOS>
but
it
must
be
so
,
till
the
next
time
.
 
<EOS>
Pox
take
that
D
;
I
will
blot
it
,
to
dry
it

LETTER
8
.
 
<EOS>
LONDON
,
Oct.
31
,
1710
.
  
<EOS>
So
,
now
I
have
sent
my
seventh
to
your
fourth
,
young
women
;
and
now
I
will
tell
you
what
I
would
not
in
my
last
,
that
this
morning
,
sitting
in
my
bed
,
I
had
a
fit
of
giddiness
:
 
<EOS>
the
room
turned
round
for
about
a
minute
,
and
then
it
went
off
,
leaving
me
sickish
,
but
not
very
:
 
<EOS>
and
so
I
passed
the
day
as
I
told
you
;
but
I
would
not
end
a
letter
with
telling
you
this
,
because
it
might
vex
you
:
 
and
I
hope
in
God
I
shall
have
no
more
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
saw
Dr.
Cockburn
to
-
day
,
and
he
promises
to
send
me
the
pills
that
did
me
good
last
year
;
and
likewise
has
promised
me
an
oil
for
my
ear
,
that
he
has
been
making
for
that
ailment
for
somebody
else
.
  
<EOS>
Nov.
1
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
MD
a
merry
new
year
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
this
is
the
first
day
of
it
with
us
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
no
giddiness
to
-
day
;
but
I
drank
brandy
,
and
have
bought
a
pint
for
two
shillings
.
 
<EOS>
I
sat
up
the
night
before
my
giddiness
pretty
late
,
and
writ
very
much
;
so
I
will
impute
it
to
that
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
never
eat
fruit
,
nor
drink
ale
;
but
drink
better
wine
than
you
do
,
as
I
did
to
-
day
with
Mr.
Addison
at
Lord
Mountjoy
's
:
 
then
went
at
five
to
see
Mr.
Harley
,
who
could
not
see
me
for
much
company
;
but
sent
me
his
excuse
,
and
desired
I
would
dine
with
him
on
Friday
;
and
then
I
expect
some
answer
to
this
business
,
which
must
either
be
soon
done
,
or
begun
again
;
and
then
the
Duke
of
Ormond
and
his
people
will
interfere
for
their
honour
,
and
do
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
I
came
home
at
six
,
and
spent
my
time
in
my
chamber
,
without
going
to
the
Coffee
-
house
,
which
I
grow
weary
of
;
and
I
studied
at
leisure
,
writ
not
above
forty
lines
,
some
inventions
of
my
own
,
and
some
hints
,
and
read
not
at
all
,
and
this
because
I
would
take
care
of
Presto
,
for
fear
little
MD
should
be
angry
.
  
<EOS>

.
 
<EOS>
I
took
my
four
pills
last
night
,
and
they
lay
an
hour
in
my
throat
,
and
so
they
will
do
to
-
night
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
I
could
swallow
four
affronts
as
easily
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
with
Dr.
Cockburn
to
-
day
,
and
came
home
at
seven
;
but
Mr.
Ford
has
been
with
me
till
just
now
,
and
it
is
near
eleven
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
had
no
giddiness
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
Mr.
 
Dopping
I
have
seen
;
and
he
tells
me
coldly
,
my
"
Shower
"
is
liked
well
enough
;
there
's
your
Irish
judgment
!
 
<EOS>
I
writ
this
post
to
the
Bishop
of
Clogher
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
now
just
a
fortnight
since
I
heard
from
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
have
you
write
once
a
fortnight
,
and
then
I
will
allow
for
wind
and
weather
.
 
<EOS>
How
goes
ombre
?
 
<EOS>
Does
Mrs.
Walls
win
constantly
,
as
she
used
to
do
?
 
<EOS>
And
Mrs.
Stoyte
;
I
have
not
thought
of
her
this
long
time
:
 
<EOS>
how
does
she
?
 
<EOS>
I
find
we
have
a
cargo
of
Irish
coming
for
London
:
 
<EOS>
I
am
sorry
for
it
;
but
I
never
go
near
them
.
 
<EOS>
And
Tighe
is
landed
;
but
Mrs.
Wesley
,
they
say
,
is
going
home
to
her
husband
,
like
a
fool
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
little
monkeys
mine
,
I
must
go
write
;
and
so
goodnight
.
  
<EOS>
3
.
 
<EOS>
I
ought
to
read
these
letters
I
write
,
after
I
have
done
;
for
,
looking
over
thus
much
,
I
found
two
or
three
literal
mistakes
,
which
should
not
be
when
the
hand
is
so
bad
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
hope
it
does
not
puzzle
little
Dingley
to
read
,
for
I
think
I
mend
:
 
but
methinks
,
when
I
write
plain
,
I
do
not
know
how
,
but
we
are
not
alone
,
all
the
world
can
see
us
.
 
<EOS>
A
bad
scrawl
is
so
snug
,
it
looks
like
a
PMD
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
scurvy
Tatlers
of
late
:
 
<EOS>
so
pray
do
not
suspect
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
one
or
two
hints
I
design
to
send
him
,
and
never
any
more
:
he
does
not
deserve
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
governed
by
his
wife
most
abominably
,
as
bad
as
#
#
#
#
.
  
<EOS>
I
never
saw
her
since
I
came
;
nor
has
he
ever
made
me
an
invitation
:
either
he
dares
not
,
or
is
such
a
thoughtless
Tisdall
fellow
,
that
he
never
minds
it
.
 
<EOS>
So
what
care
I
for
his
wit
?
<EOS>
for
he
is
the
worst
company
in
the
world
,
till
he
has
a
bottle
of
wine
in
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
write
straighter
in
bed
,
so
you
must
be
content
.
 
<EOS>
At
night
in
bed
.
 
<EOS>
Stay
,
let
me
see
where
's
this
letter
to
MD
among
these
papers
?
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
here
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
I
will
go
on
now
;
but
I
am
very
busy
(
smoke
the
new
pen
.
)
 
<EOS>
I
dined
with
Mr.
Harley
to
-
day
,
and
am
invited
there
again
on
Sunday
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
now
leave
to
write
to
the
Primate
and
Archbishop
of
Dublin
,
that
the
Queen
has
granted
the
First
-
Fruits
;
but
they
are
to
take
no
notice
of
it
,
till
a
letter
is
sent
them
by
the
Queen
's
orders
from
Lord
Dartmouth
,
Secretary
of
State
,
to
signify
it
.
 
<EOS>
The
bishops
are
to
be
made
a
corporation
,
to
dispose
of
the
revenue
,
etc
.
<EOS>
;
and
I
shall
write
to
the
Archbishop
of
Dublin
to
-
morrow
<EOS>
(
I
have
had
no
giddiness
to
-
day
)
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
not
whether
they
will
have
any
occasion
for
me
longer
to
be
here
;
nor
can
I
judge
till
I
see
what
letter
the
Queen
sends
to
the
bishops
,
and
what
they
will
do
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
If
despatch
be
used
,
it
may
be
done
in
six
weeks
;
but
I
can
not
judge
.
 
<EOS>
They
sent
me
to
-
day
a
new
Commission
,
signed
by
the
Primate
and
Archbishop
of
Dublin
,
and
promise
me
letters
to
the
two
archbishops
here
;
but
mine
<EOS>
a
#
#
#
#
 
for
it
all
.
 
<EOS>
The
thing
is
done
,
and
has
been
so
these
ten
days
;
though
I
had
only
leave
to
tell
it
to
-
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
this
day
likewise
<EOS>
a
letter
from
the
Bishop
of
Clogher
,
who
complains
of
my
not
writing
;
and
,
what
vexes
me
,
says
he
knows
you
have
long
letters
from
me
every
week
.
 
<EOS>
Why
do
you
tell
him
so
?
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
not
right
,
faith
:
 
<EOS>
but
I
wo
n't
be
angry
with
MD
at
distance
.
 
<EOS>
I
writ
to
him
last
post
,
before
I
had
his
;
and
will
write
again
soon
,
since
I
see
he
expects
it
,
and
that
Lord
and
Lady
Mountjoy
put
him
off
upon
me
,
to
give
themselves
ease
.
 
<EOS>
Lastly
,
I
had
this
day
a
letter
from
a
certain
naughty
rogue
called
MD
,
and
it
was
N.
5
;
which
I
shall
not
answer
to
-
night
,
I
thank
you
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
faith
<EOS>
,
I
have
other
fish
to
fry
;
but
to
-
morrow
or
next
day
will
be
time
enough
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
put
MD
's
commissions
in
a
memorandum
paper
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
have
done
all
before
,
and
remember
nothing
but
this
to
-
day
about
glasses
and
spectacles
and
spectacle
cases
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
commission
from
Stella
,
but
the
chocolate
and
handkerchiefs
;
and
those
are
bought
,
and
I
expect
they
will
be
soon
sent
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
with
,
and
sent
to
,
Mr.
Sterne
,
two
or
three
times
to
know
;
but
he
was
not
within
.
 
<EOS>
Odds
my
life
,
what
am
I
doing
?
<EOS>
I
must
go
write
and
do
business
.
  
<EOS>

.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
to
-
day
at
Kensington
,
with
Addison
,
Steele
,
etc
.
,
came
home
,
and
writ
a
short
letter
to
the
Archbishop
of
Dublin
,
to
let
him
know
the
Queen
has
granted
the
thing
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
I
writ
in
the
Coffee
-
house
,
for
I
stayed
at
Kensington
till
nine
,
and
am
plaguy
weary
;
for
Colonel
Proud
was
very
ill
company
,
and
I
will
never
be
of
a
party
with
him
again
;
and
I
drank
punch
,
and
that
and
ill
company
has
made
me
hot
.
  
<EOS>
5
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
with
Mr.
Harley
from
dinner
to
seven
this
night
,
and
went
to
the
Coffee
-
house
,
where
Dr.
Davenant
would
fain
have
had
me
gone
and
drink
a
bottle
of
wine
at
his
house
hard
by
,
with
Dr.
Chamberlen
,
but
the
puppy
used
so
many
words
,
that
I
was
afraid
of
his
company
;
and
though
we
promised
to
come
at
eight
,
I
sent
a
messenger
to
him
,
that
Chamberlen
was
going
to
a
patient
,
and
therefore
we
would
put
it
off
till
another
time
:
 
<EOS>
so
he
,
and
the
Comptroller
,
and
I
,
were
prevailed
on
by
Sir
Matthew
Dudley
to
go
to
his
house
,
where
I
stayed
till
twelve
,
and
left
them
.
 
<EOS>
Davenant
has
been
teasing
me
to
look
over
some
of
his
writings
that
he
is
going
to
publish
;
but
the
rogue
is
so
fond
of
his
own
productions
,
that
I
hear
he
will
not
part
with
a
syllable
;
and
he
has
lately
put
out
a
foolish
pamphlet
,
called
The
Third
Part
of
Tom
Double
;
to
make
his
court
to
the
Tories
,
whom
he
had
left
.
  
<EOS>

.
 
<EOS>
I
was
to
-
day
gambling
in
the
City
to
see
Patty
Rolt
,
who
is
going
to
Kingston
,
where
she
lodges
;
but
,
to
say
the
truth
,
I
had
a
mind
for
a
walk
to
exercise
myself
,
and
happened
to
be
disengaged
:
 
for
dinners
<EOS>
are
ten
times
more
plentiful
with
me
here
than
ever
,
or
than
in
Dublin
.
 
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
answer
your
letter
yet
,
because
I
am
busy
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
to
send
this
before
I
have
another
from
MD
:
 
<EOS>
it
would
be
a
sad
thing
to
answer
two
letters
together
,
as
MD
does
from
Presto
.
 
<EOS>
But
when
the
two
sides
are
full
,
away
the
letter
shall
go
<EOS>
,
that
is
certain
,
like
it
or
not
like
it
;
and
that
will
be
about
three
days
hence
,
for
the
answering
-
night
will
be
a
long
one
.

<EOS>
I
dined
to
-
day
at
Sir
Richard
Temple
's
,
with
Congreve
,
Vanbrugh
,
Lieutenant
-
General
Farrington
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
Vanbrugh
,
I
believe
I
told
you
,
had
a
long
quarrel
with
me
about
those
verses
on
his
house
;
but
we
were
very
civil
and
cold
.
 
<EOS>
Lady
Marlborough
used
to
tease
him
with
them
,
which
had
made
him
angry
,
though
he
be
a
good
-
natured
fellow
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
Thanksgiving
-
day
,
and
I
was
at
Court
,
where
the
Queen
passed
us
by
with
all
Tories
about
her
;
not
one
<EOS>
Whig
:
 
Buckingham
,
Rochester
,
Leeds
,
Shrewsbury
,
Berkeley
of
Stratton
,
Lord
Keeper
Harcourt
,
Mr.
Harley
,
Lord
Pembroke
,
etc
.
<EOS>
;
and
I
have
seen
her
without
one
Tory
.
 
<EOS>
The
Queen
made
me
a
curtsey
,
and
said
,
in
a
sort
of
familiar
way
to
Presto
,
"
How
does
MD
?
"
 
<EOS>
I
considered
she
was
a
Queen
,
and
so
excused
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
miss
the
Whigs
at
Court
;
but
have
as
many
acquaintance
there
as
formerly
.
  
<EOS>

.
 
<EOS>
Here
's
ado
and
a
clutter
!
 
<EOS>
I
must
now
answer
MD
's
fifth
;
but
first
you
must
know
I
dined
at
the
Portugal
Envoy
's
to
-
day
,
with
Addison
,
Vanbrugh
,
Admiral
Wager
,
Sir
Richard
Temple
,
Methuen
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
weary
of
their
company
,
and
stole
away
at
five
,
and
came
home
like
a
good
boy
,
and
studied
till
ten
,
and
had
a
fire
,
O
ho
!
<EOS>
and
now
am
in
bed
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
fireplace
in
my
bed
-
chamber
;
but
'
tis
very
warm
weather
when
one
's
in
bed
.
<EOS>
Your
fine
cap
,
Madam
Dingley
,
is
too
little
,
and
too
hot
:
 
<EOS>
I
will
have
that
fur
taken
off
;
I
wish
it
were
far
enough
;
and
my
old
velvet
cap
is
good
for
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
Is
it
velvet
under
the
fur
?
 
<EOS>
I
was
feeling
,
but
can
not
find
:
 
if
it
be
,
'
twill
do
without
it
else
<EOS>
I
will
face
it
;
but
then
I
must
buy
new
velvet
:
 
but
may
be
I
may
beg
a
piece
.
 
<EOS>
What
shall
I
do
?
 
<EOS>
Well
,
now
to
rogue
MD
's
letter
.
 
<EOS>
God
be
thanked
for
Stella
's
eyes
mending
;
and
God
send
it
holds
;
but
faith
you
writ
too
much
at
a
time
:
 
better
write
less
,
or
write
it
at
ten
times
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
faith
,
a
long
letter
in
a
morning
from
a
dear
friend
is
a
dear
thing
.
 
<EOS>
I
smoke
a
compliment
,
little
mischievous
girls
,
I
do
so
.
 
<EOS>
But
who
are
those
WIGGS
that
think
I
am
turned
Tory
?
 
<EOS>
Do
you
mean
Whigs
?
 
<EOS>
Which
WIGGS
and
WAT
<EOS>
do
you
mean
?
 
<EOS>
I
know
nothing
of
Raymond
,
and
only
had
one
letter
from
him
a
little
after
I
came
here.[Pray
<EOS>
remember
Morgan
.
)
 
<EOS>
Raymond
is
indeed
like
to
have
much
influence
over
me
in
London
,
and
to
share
much
of
my
conversation
.
<EOS>
I
shall
,
no
doubt
,
introduce
him
to
Harley
,
and
Lord
Keeper
,
and
the
Secretary
of
State
.
 
<EOS>
The
Tatler
upon
Ithuriel
's
spear
is
not
mine
,
madam
.
 
<EOS>
What
a
puzzle
there
is
betwixt
you
and
your
judgment
!
 
<EOS>
In
general
you
may
be
sometimes
sure
of
things
,
as
that
about
STYLE
,
because
it
is
what
I
have
frequently
spoken
of
;
but
guessing
is
mine
a
#
#
#
#
,
and
I
defy
mankind
,
if
I
please
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
I
writ
a
pamphlet
when
I
was
last
in
London
,
that
you
and
a
thousand
have
seen
,
and
never
guessed
it
to
be
mine
.
 
<EOS>
Could
you
have
guessed
the
"
Shower
in
Town
"
to
be
mine
?
 
<EOS>
How
chance
you
did
not
see
that
before
your
last
letter
went
?
<EOS>
but
I
suppose
you
in
Ireland
did
not
think
it
worth
mentioning
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
am
I
suspected
for
the
lampoon
;
only
Harley
said
he
smoked
me
;
(
have
I
told
you
so
before
?
)
<EOS>
and
some
others
knew
it
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
called
"
The
Rod
of
Sid
Hamet
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
I
have
written
several
other
things
that
I
hear
commended
,
and
nobody
suspects
me
for
them
;
nor
you
shall
not
know
till
I
see
you
again
.
 
<EOS>
What
do
you
mean
,
"
That
boards
near
me
,
that
I
dine
with
now
and
then
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
know
no
such
person
:
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
dine
with
boarders
.
 
<EOS>
What
the
pox
!
<EOS>
You
know
whom
I
have
dined
with
every
day
since
I
left
you
,
better
than
I
do
.
<EOS>
What
do
you
mean
,
sirrah
?
 
<EOS>
Slids
,
my
ailment
has
been
over
these
two
months
almost
.
 
<EOS>
Impudence
,
if
you
vex
me
,
I
will
give
ten
shillings
a
week
for
my
lodging
;
for
I
am
almost
st
 
<EOS>
k
out
of
this
with
the
sink
,
and
it
helps
me
to
verses
in
my
"
Shower
.
"
 
<EOS>
Well
,
Madam
Dingley
,
what
say
you
to
the
world
to
come
?
 
<EOS>
What
ballad
?
 
<EOS>
Why
go
look
,
it
was
not
good
for
much
:
 
<EOS>
have
patience
till
I
come
back
:
 
<EOS>
patience
is
a
gay
thing
as
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
I
hear
nothing
of
Lord
Mountjoy
's
coming
for
Ireland
.
 
<EOS>
When
is
Stella
's
birthday
?
<EOS>
in
March
?
 
<EOS>
Lord
bless
me
,
my
turn
at
Christ
Church
;
it
is
so
natural
to
hear
you
write
about
that
<EOS>
,
I
believe
you
have
done
it
a
hundred
times
;
it
is
as
fresh
in
my
mind
,
the
verger
coming
to
you
;
and
why
to
you
?
 
<EOS>
Would
he
have
you
preach
for
me
?
 
<EOS>
O
,
pox
on
your
spelling
of
Latin
,
Johnsonibus
atque
,
that
is
the
way
.
<EOS>
How
did
the
Dean
get
that
name
by
the
end
?
 
<EOS>
'
Twas
you
betrayed
me
:
 
not
I
,
faith
;
I
'll
not
break
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
Your
mother
is
still
in
the
country
,
I
suppose
;
for
she
promised
to
see
me
when
she
came
to
town
.
 
<EOS>
I
writ
to
her
four
days
ago
,
to
desire
her
to
break
it
to
Lady
Giffard
,
to
put
some
money
for
you
in
the
Bank
,
which
was
then
fallen
thirty
per
cent
.
 
<EOS>
Would
to
God
mine
had
been
here
,
I
should
have
gained
one
hundred
pounds
,
and
got
as
good
interest
as
in
Ireland
,
and
much
securer
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
fain
have
borrowed
three
hundred
pounds
;
but
money
is
so
scarce
here
<EOS>
,
there
is
no
borrowing
,
by
this
fall
of
stocks
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
rising
now
,
and
I
knew
it
would
:
 
<EOS>
it
fell
from
one
hundred
and
twenty
-
nine
to
ninety
-
six
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
heard
since
from
your
mother
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
think
I
would
be
so
unkind
not
to
see
her
,
that
you
desire
me
in
a
style
so
melancholy
?
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Raymond
,
you
say
,
is
with
child
:
 
<EOS>
I
am
sorry
for
it
;
and
so
is
,
I
believe
,
her
husband
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Harley
speaks
all
the
kind
things
to
me
in
the
world
;
and
,
I
believe
,
would
serve
me
,
if
I
were
to
stay
here
;
but
I
reckon
in
time
the
Duke
of
Ormond
may
give
me
some
addition
to
Laracor
.
 
<EOS>
Why
should
the
Whigs
think
I
came
to
England
to
leave
them
?
 
<EOS>
Sure
my
journey
was
no
secret
.
 
<EOS>
I
protest
sincerely
<EOS>
,
I
did
all
I
could
to
hinder
it
,
as
the
Dean
can
tell
you
,
although
now
I
do
not
repent
it
.
 
<EOS>
But
who
the
Devil
cares
what
they
think
?
 
<EOS>
Am
I
under
obligations
in
the
least
to
any
of
them
all
?
 
<EOS>
Rot
'em
,
for
ungrateful
dogs
;
I
will
make
them
repent
their
usage
before
I
leave
this
place
.
 
<EOS>
They
say
here
the
same
thing
of
my
leaving
the
Whigs
;
but
they
own
they
can
not
blame
me
,
considering
the
treatment
I
have
had
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
take
care
of
your
spectacles
,
as
I
told
you
before
,
and
of
the
Bishop
of
Killala
's
;
but
I
will
not
write
to
him
,
I
have
not
time
.
 
<EOS>
What
do
you
mean
by
my
fourth
,
Madam
Dinglibus
?
 
<EOS>
Does
not
Stella
say
you
have
had
my
fifth
<EOS>
,
Goody
Blunder
?
<EOS>
You
frighted
me
till
I
looked
back
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
this
is
enough
for
one
night
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
give
my
humble
service
to
Mrs.
Stoyte
and
her
sister
,
Kate
is
it
,
or
Sarah
?
 
<EOS>
I
have
forgot
her
name
,
faith
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
will
even
(
and
to
Mrs.
Walls
and
the
Archdeacon
)
send
this
to
-
morrow
:
 
<EOS>
no
,
faith
,
that
will
be
in
ten
days
from
the
last
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
keep
it
till
Saturday
,
though
I
write
no
more
.
<EOS>
But
what
if
a
letter
from
MD
should
come
in
the
meantime
?
 
<EOS>
Why
then
I
would
only
say
,
"
Madam
,
I
have
received
your
sixth
letter
;
your
most
humble
servant
to
command
,
Presto
"
;
and
so
conclude
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
now
I
will
write
and
think
a
little
,
and
so
to
bed
,
and
dream
of
MD
.
  
<EOS>

.
 
<EOS>
I
have
my
mouth
full
of
water
,
and
was
going
to
spit
it
out
,
because
I
reasoned
with
myself
,
how
could
I
write
when
my
mouth
was
full
?
 
<EOS>
Han't
<EOS>
you
done
things
like
that
,
reasoned
wrong
at
first
thinking
?
 
<EOS>
Well
,
I
was
to
see
Mr.
Lewis
this
morning
,
and
am
to
dine
a
few
days
hence
,
as
he
tells
me
,
with
Mr.
Secretary
St.
John
;
and
I
must
contrive
to
see
Harley
soon
again
,
to
hasten
this
business
from
the
Queen
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
to
-
day
at
Lord
Mountrath
's
,
with
Lord
Mountjoy
,
etc
.
<EOS>
;
but
the
wine
was
not
good
,
so
I
came
away
,
stayed
at
the
Coffee
-
house
till
seven
,
then
came
home
to
my
fire
,
the
maidenhead
of
my
second
half
-
bushel
,
and
am
now
in
bed
at
eleven
,
as
usual
.
'
<EOS>
Tis
mighty
warm
<EOS>
;
yet
I
fear
I
should
catch
cold
this
wet
weather
,
if
I
sat
an
evening
in
my
room
after
coming
from
warm
places
:
 
and
I
must
make
much
of
myself
,
because
MD
is
not
here
to
take
care
of
Presto
;
and
I
am
full
of
business
,
writing
,
etc
.
,
and
do
not
care
for
the
Coffee
-
house
;
and
so
this
serves
for
all
together
,
not
to
tell
it
you
over
and
over
,
as
silly
people
do
;
but
Presto
is
a
wiser
man
,
faith
,
than
so
,
let
me
tell
you
,
gentlewomen
.
 
<EOS>
See
,
I
am
got
to
the
third
side
;
but
,
faith
,
I
will
not
do
that
often
;
but
I
must
say
something
early
to
-
day
,
till
the
letter
is
done
,
and
on
Saturday
it
shall
go
;
so
I
must
leave
something
till
to
-
morrow
,
till
to
-
morrow
and
next
day
.
  
<EOS>

.
 
<EOS>
O
Lord
,
I
would
this
letter
was
with
you
with
all
my
heart
!
 
<EOS>
If
it
should
miscarry
,
what
a
deal
would
be
lost
!
 
<EOS>
I
forgot
to
leave
a
gap
in
the
last
line
but
one
for
the
seal
,
like
a
puppy
;
but
I
should
have
allowed
for
night
,
goodnight
;
but
when
I
am
taking
leave
,
I
can
not
leave
a
bit
,
faith
;
but
I
fancy
the
seal
will
not
come
there
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
to
-
day
at
Lady
Lucy
's
,
where
they
ran
down
my
"
Shower
"
;
and
said
,
"
Sid
Hamet
"
was
the
silliest
poem
they
ever
read
;
and
told
Prior
so
,
whom
they
thought
to
be
author
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
wonder
I
never
dined
there
before
?
 
<EOS>
But
I
am
too
busy
,
and
they
live
too
far
off
;
and
,
besides
,
I
do
not
like
women
so
much
as
I
did
.
 
<EOS>
(
MD
,
you
must
know
,
are
not
women
.
)
 
<EOS>
I
supped
to
-
night
at
Addison
's
,
with
Garth
,
Steele
,
and
Mr.
Dopping
;
and
am
come
home
late
.
 
<EOS>
Lewis
has
sent
to
me
to
desire
I
will
dine
with
some
company
I
shall
like
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
it
is
Mr.
Secretary
St.
John
's
appointment
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
a
letter
just
now
from
Raymond
,
who
is
at
Bristol
,
and
says
he
will
be
at
London
in
a
fortnight
,
and
leave
his
wife
behind
him
;
and
desires
any
lodging
in
the
house
where
I
am
:
 
but
that
must
not
be
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
not
know
what
to
do
with
him
in
town
:
 
to
be
sure
,
I
will
not
present
him
to
any
acquaintance
of
mine
;
and
he
will
live
a
delicate
life
,
a
parson
and
a
perfect
stranger
!
 
<EOS>
Paaast
twelvvve
o'clock
,
and
so
good

night
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
but
I
forgot
,
Jemmy
Leigh
is
come
to
town
;
says
he
has
brought
Dingley
's
things
,
and
will
send
them
with
the
first
convenience
.
 
<EOS>
My
parcel
,
I
hear
,
is
not
sent
yet
.
 
<EOS>
He
thinks
of
going
for
Ireland
in
a
month
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
write
tomorrow
,
because
 
what
,
because
of
the
Archbishop
;
because
I
will
seal
my
letter
early
;
because
I
am
engaged
from
noon
till
night
;
because
of
many
kind
of
things
;
and
yet
I
will
write
one
or
two
words
to
-
morrow
morning
,
to
keep
up
my
journal
constant
,
and
at
night
I
will
begin
my
ninth

<EOS>
Morning
by
candlelight

<EOS>
You
must
know
that
I
am
in
my
nightgown
every
morning
between
six
and
seven
,
and
Patrick
is
forced
to
ply
me
fifty
times
before
I
can
get
on
my
nightgown
;
and
so
now
I
will
take
my
leave
of
my
own
dear
MD
for
this
letter
,
and
begin
my
next
when
I
come
home
at
night

<EOS>
God
Almighty
bless
and
protect
dearest

Farewell

LETTER
9
.
 
<EOS>
LONDON
,
Nov.
11
,
1710
.
  
<EOS>
I
dined
to
-
day
,
by
invitation
,
with
the
Secretary
of
State
,
Mr.
St.
John
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Harley
came
in
to
us
before
dinner
,
and
made
me
his
excuses
for
not
dining
with
us
,
because
he
was
to
receive
people
who
came
to
propose
advancing
money
to
the
Government
:
 
there
dined
with
us
only
Mr.
Lewis
,
and
Dr.
Freind
(
that
writ
"
Lord
Peterborow
's
Actions
in
Spain
"
)
.
 
<EOS>
I
stayed
with
them
till
just
now
between
ten
and
eleven
,
and
was
forced
again
to
give
my
eighth
to
the
bellman
,
which
I
did
with
my
own
hands
,
rather
than
keep
it
till
next
post
.
<EOS>
The
Secretary
used
me
with
all
the
kindness
in
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
Prior
came
in
after
dinner
;
and
,
upon
an
occasion
,
he
(
the
Secretary
)
said
,
"
The
best
thing
I
ever
read
is
not
yours
,
but
Dr.
Swift
's
on
Vanbrugh
"
;
which
I
do
not
reckon
so
very
good
neither
.
 
<EOS>
But
Prior
was
damped
,
until
I
stuffed
him
with
two
or
three
compliments
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
thinking
what
a
veneration
we
used
to
have
for
Sir
William
Temple
,
because
he
might
have
been
Secretary
of
State
at
fifty
;
and
here
is
a
young
fellow
,
hardly
thirty
,
in
that
employment
.
 
<EOS>
His
father
is
a
man
of
pleasure
,
that
walks
the
Mall
,
and
frequents
St.
James
's
Coffee
-
house
,
and
the
chocolate
-
houses
;
and
the
young
son
is
principal
Secretary
of
State
.
 
<EOS>
Is
there
not
something
very
odd
in
that
?
 
<EOS>
He
told
me
,
among
other
things
,
that
Mr.
Harley
complained
he
could
keep
nothing
from
me
<EOS>
,
I
had
the
way
<EOS>
so
much
of
getting
into
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
knew
that
was
a
refinement
;
and
so
I
told
him
,
and
it
was
so
:
 
indeed
<EOS>
,
it
is
hard
to
see
these
great
men
use
me
like
one
who
was
their
betters
,
and
the
puppies
with
you
in
Ireland
hardly
regarding
me
:
 
but
there
are
some
reasons
for
all
this
,
which
I
will
tell
you
when
we
meet
.
 
<EOS>
At
coming
home
,
I
saw
a
letter
from
your
mother
,
in
answer
to
one
I
sent
her
two
days
ago
.
 
<EOS>
It
seems
she
is
in
town
;
but
can
not
come
out
in
a
morning
,
just
as
you
said
;
and
God
knows
when
I
shall
be
at
leisure
in
an
afternoon
:
 
for
if
I
should
send
her
a
penny
-
post
letter
,
and
afterwards
not
be
able
to
meet
her
,
it
would
vex
me
;
and
,
besides
,
the
days
are
short
,
and
why
she
can
not
come
early
in
a
morning
,
before
she
is
wanted
,
I
can
not
imagine
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
desire
her
to
let
Lady
Giffard
know
that
she
hears
I
am
in
town
;
and
that
she
would
go
to
see
me
,
to
inquire
after
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
wonder
she
will
confine
herself
so
much
to
that
old
beast
's
humour
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
I
can
not
in
honour
see
Lady
Giffard
,
and
consequently
not
go
into
her
house
.
 
<EOS>
This
I
think
is
enough
for
the
first
time
.
  
<EOS>
12
.
 
<EOS>
And
how
could
you
write
with
such
thin
paper
?
  
<EOS>
(
I
forgot
to
say
this
in
my
former
.
)
 
<EOS>
Can
not
you
get
thicker
?
 
<EOS>
Why
,
that
's
a
common
caution
that
writing
-
masters
give
their
scholars
;
you
must
have
heard
it
a
hundred
times
.
'
<EOS>
Tis
this
:
       
<EOS>
"
If
paper
be
thin
,
      
Ink
will
slip
in
;
      
But
,
if
it
be
thick
,
      
You
may
write
with
a
stick
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
had
a
letter
to
-
day
from
poor
Mrs.
Long
,
giving
me
an
account
of
her
present
life
,
obscure
in
a
remote
country
town
,
and
how
easy
she
is
under
it
.
<EOS>
Poor
creature
!
 
<EOS>
'
tis
just
such
an
alteration
in
life
,
as
if
Presto
should
be
banished
from
MD
,
and
condemned
to
converse
with
Mrs.
Raymond
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
to
-
day
with
Ford
,
Sir
Richard
Levinge
,
etc
.
,
at
a
place
where
they
board
,
hard
by
.
<EOS>
I
was
lazy
,
and
not
very
well
,
sitting
so
long
with
company
yesterday
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
very
busy
writing
this
evening
at
home
,
and
had
a
fire
:
 
I
am
spending
my
second
half
-
bushel
of
coals
;
and
now
am
in
bed
,
and
'
tis
late
.
  
<EOS>
13
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
to
-
day
in
the
City
,
and
then
went
to
christen
Will
Frankland
's
child
;
and
Lady
Falconbridge
was
one
of
the
godmothers
:
 
<EOS>
this
is
a
daughter
of
Oliver
Cromwell
,
and
extremely
like
him
by
his
pictures
that
I
have
seen
.
<EOS>
I
stayed
till
almost
eleven
,
and
am
now
come
home
and
gone
to
bed
.
 
<EOS>
My
business
in
the
City
was
,
to
thank
Stratford
for
a
kindness
he
has
done
me
,
which
now
I
will
tell
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
found
Bank
Stock
was
fallen
thirty
-
four
in
the
hundred
,
and
was
mighty
desirous
to
buy
it
;
but
I
was
a
little
too
late
for
the
cheapest
time
,
being
hindered
by
business
here
;
for
I
was
so
wise
to
guess
to
a
day
when
it
would
fall
.
 
<EOS>
My
project
was
this
:
 
<EOS>
I
had
three
hundred
pounds
in
Ireland
;
and
so
I
writ
to
Mr.
Stratford
in
the
City
,
to
desire
he
would
buy
me
three
hundred
pounds
in
Bank
Stock
,
and
that
he
should
keep
the
papers
,
and
that
I
would
be
bound
to
pay
him
for
them
;
and
,
if
it
should
rise
or
fall
,
I
would
take
my
chance
,
and
pay
him
interest
in
the
meantime
.
 
<EOS>
I
showed
my
letter
to
one
or
two
people
who
understand
those
things
;
and
they
said
money
was
so
hard
to
be
got
here
,
that
no
man
would
do
it
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
Stratford
,
who
is
the
most
generous
man
alive
,
has
done
it
:
 
<EOS>
but
it
costs
one
hundred
pounds
and
a
half
,
that
is
,
ten
shillings
;
so
that
three
hundred
pounds
cost
me
three
hundred
pounds
and
thirty
shillings
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
done
about
a
week
ago
,
and
I
can
have
five
pounds
for
my
bargain
already
.
 
<EOS>
Before
it
fell
,
it
was
one
hundred
and
thirty
pounds
;
and
we
are
sure
it
will
be
the
same
again
.
 
<EOS>
I
told
you
I
writ
to
your
mother
,
to
desire
that
Lady
Giffard
would
do
the
same
with
what
she
owes
you
;
but
she
tells
your
mother
she
has
no
money
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
to
God
all
you
had
in
the
world
<EOS>
was
there
.
 
<EOS>
Whenever
you
lend
money
,
take
this
rule
,
to
have
two
people
bound
,
who
have
both
visible
fortunes
;
for
they
will
hardly
die
together
;
and
,
when
one
dies
,
you
fall
upon
the
other
,
and
make
him
add
another
security
:
 
and
if
Rathburn
(
now
I
have
his
name
)
pays
you
in
your
money
,
let
me
know
,
and
I
will
direct
Parvisol
accordingly
:
 
however
,
he
shall
wait
on
you
and
know
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
ladies
,
enough
of
business
for
one
night
.
 
<EOS>
Paaaaast
twelvvve
o'clock
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
only
add
,
that
,
after
a
long
fit
of
rainy
weather
,
it
has
been
fair
two
or
three
days
,
and
is
this
day
grown
cold
and
frosty
;
so
that
you
must
give
poor
little
Presto
leave
to
have
a
fire
in
his
chamber
morning
and
evening
too
;
and
he
will
do
as
much
for
you
.
  
<EOS>

.
 
<EOS>
What
,
has
your
Chancellor
lost
his
senses
,
like
Will
Crowe
?
 
<EOS>
I
forgot
to
tell
Dingley
that
I
was
yesterday
at
Ludgate
,
bespeaking
the
spectacles
at
the
great
shop
there
,
and
shall
have
them
in
a
day
or
two
.
 
<EOS>
This
has
been
an
insipid
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
with
Mrs.
Vanhomrigh
,
and
came
gravely
home
,
after
just
visiting
the
Coffee
-
house
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
Richard
Cox
,
they
say
,
is
sure
of
going
over
Lord
Chancellor
,
who
is
as
arrant
a
puppy
as
ever
ate
bread
:
but
the
Duke
of
Ormond
has
a
natural
affection
to
puppies
;
which
is
a
thousand
pities
,
being
none
himself
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
amusing
myself
at
home
till
now
,
and
in
bed
bid
you
good
-
night
.
  
<EOS>
15
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
visiting
this
morning
,
but
nobody
was
at
home
,
Secretary
St.
John
,
Sir
Thomas
Hanmer
,
Sir
Chancellor
Cox
-
comb
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
I
attended
the
Duke
of
Ormond
with
about
fifty
other
Irish
gentlemen
at
Skinners
'
Hall
,
where
the
Londonderry
Society
laid
out
three
hundred
pounds
to
treat
us
and
his
Grace
with
a
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
Three
great
tables
with
the
dessert
laid
in
mighty
figure
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
Richard
Levinge
and
I
got
discreetly
to
the
head
of
the
second
table
,
to
avoid
the
crowd
at
the
first
:
 
<EOS>
but
it
was
so
cold
,
and
so
confounded
a
noise
with
the
trumpets
and
hautboys
,
that
I
grew
weary
,
and
stole
away
before
the
second
course
came
on
;
<EOS>
so
I
can
give
you
no
account
of
it
,
which
is
a
thousand
pities
.
 
<EOS>
I
called
at
Ludgate
for
Dingley
's
glasses
,
and
shall
have
them
in
a
day
or
two
;
and
I
doubt
it
will
cost
me
thirty
shillings
for
a
microscope
,
but
not
without
Stella
's
permission
;
for
I
remember
she
is
a
virtuoso
.
 
<EOS>
Shall
I
buy
it
or
no
?
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
not
the
great
bulky
ones
,
nor
the
common
little
ones
,
to
impale
a
louse
(
saving
your
presence
)
upon
a
needle
's
point
;
but
of
a
more
exact
sort
,
and
clearer
to
the
sight
,
with
all
its
equipage
in
a
little
trunk
that
you
may
carry
in
your
pocket
.
 
<EOS>
Tell
me
,
sirrah
,
shall
I
buy
it
or
not
for
you
?
  
<EOS>
I
came
home
straight
,
etc
.
  
<EOS>
16
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
to
-
day
in
the
city
with
Mr.
Manley
,
who
invited
Mr.
Addison
and
me
,
and
some
other
friends
,
to
his
lodging
,
and
entertained
us
very
handsomely
.
 
<EOS>
I
returned
with
Mr.
Addison
,
and
loitered
till
nine
in
the
Coffee
-
house
,
where
I
am
hardly
known
,
by
going
so
seldom
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
here
soliciting
for
Trounce
;
you
know
him
:
 
<EOS>
he
was
gunner
in
the
former
yacht
,
and
would
fain
be
so
in
the
present
one
if
you
remember
him
,
a
good
,
lusty
,
fresh
-
coloured
fellow
.
 
<EOS>
Shall
I
stay
till
I
get
another
letter
from
MD
before
I
close
up
this
?
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Addison
and
I
meet
a
little
seldomer
than
formerly
,
although
we
are
still
at
bottom
as
good
friends
as
ever
,
but
differ
a
little
about
party
.
  
<EOS>
17
.
 
<EOS>
To
-
day
I
went
to
Lewis
at
the
Secretary
's
office
;
where
I
saw
and
spoke
to
Mr.
Harley
,
who
promised
,
in
a
few
days
,
to
finish
the
rest
of
my
business
.
<EOS>
I
reproached
him
for
putting
me
on
the
necessity
of
minding
him
of
it
,
and
rallied
him
,
etc
.
,
which
he
took
very
well
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
to
-
day
with
one
Mr.
Gore
,
elder
brother
to
a
young
merchant
of
my
acquaintance
;
and
Stratford
and
my
other
friend
merchants
dined
with
us
,
where
I
stayed
late
,
drinking
claret
and
burgundy
;
and
am
just
got
to
bed
,
and
will
say
no
more
,
but
that
it
now
begins
to
be
time
to
have
a
letter
from
my
own
little
MD
;
for
the
last
I
had
above
a
fortnight
ago
,
and
the
date
was
old
too
.
  
<EOS>
18
.
 
<EOS>
To
-
day
I
dined
with
Lewis
and
Prior
at
an
eating
-
house
,
but
with
Lewis
's
wine
.
 
<EOS>
Lewis
went
away
,
and
Prior
<EOS>
and
I
sat
on
,
where
we
complimented
one
another
for
an
hour
or
two
upon
our
mutual
wit
and
poetry
.
 
<EOS>
Coming
home
at
seven
,
a
gentleman
unknown
stopped
me
in
the
Pall
Mall
,
and
asked
my
advice
;
said
he
had
been
to
see
the
Queen
(
who
was
just
come
to
town
,
and
the
people
in
waiting
would
not
let
him
see
her
<EOS>
;
that
he
had
two
hundred
thousand
men
ready
to
serve
her
in
the
war
;
that
he
knew
the
Queen
perfectly
well
,
and
had
an
apartment
at
Court
,
and
if
she
heard
he
was
there
,
she
would
send
for
him
immediately
;
that
she
owed
him
two
hundred
thousand
pounds
,
etc
.
,
and
he
desired
my
opinion
,
whether
he
should
go
try
again
whether
he
could
see
her
;
or
because
,
perhaps
,
she
was
weary
after
her
journey
,
whether
he
had
not
better
stay
till
to
-
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
a
mind
to
get
rid
of
my
companion
,
and
begged
him
of
all
love
to
go
and
wait
on
her
immediately
;
for
that
,
to
my
knowledge
,
the
Queen
would
admit
him
;
that
this
was
an
affair
of
great
importance
,
and
required
despatch
:
 
and
I
instructed
him
to
let
me
know
the
success
of
his
business
,
and
come
to
the
Smyrna
Coffee
-
house
,
where
I
would
wait
for
him
till
midnight
;
and
so
ended
this
adventure
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
have
fain
given
the
man
half
a
crown
;
but
was
afraid
to
offer
it
him
,
lest
he
should
be
offended
;
<EOS>
for
,
beside
his
money
,
he
said
he
had
a
thousand
pounds
a
year
.
 
<EOS>
I
came
home
not
early
;
and
<EOS>
so
,
madams
both
,
goodnight
,
etc
.
  
<EOS>
19
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
to
-
day
with
poor
Lord
Mountjoy
,
who
is
ill
of
the
gout
;
and
this
evening
I
christened
our
coffee
-
man
Elliot
's
child
,
where
the
rogue
had
a
most
noble
supper
,
and
Steele
<EOS>
and
I
sat
among
some
scurvy
company
over
a
bowl
of
punch
;
<EOS>
so
that
I
am
come
home
late
,
young
women
,
and
ca
n't
stay
to
write
to
little
rogues
.
  
<EOS>
2O.
 
<EOS>
I
loitered
at
home
,
and
dined
with
Sir
Andrew
Fountaine
at
his
lodging
,
and
then
came
home
:
 
a
silly
day
.
  
<EOS>
21
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
visiting
all
this
morning
,
and
then
went
to
the
Secretary
's
office
,
and
found
Mr.
Harley
,
with
whom
I
dined
;
and
Secretary
St.
John
,
etc
.
,
and
Harley
promised
in
a
very
few
days
to
finish
what
remains
of
my
business
.
<EOS>
Prior
was
of
the
company
,
and
we
all
dine
at
the
Secretary
's
to
-
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
I
saw
Stella
's
mother
this
morning
:
 
<EOS>
she
came
early
,
and
we
talked
an
hour
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
you
would
propose
to
Lady
Giffard
to
take
the
three
hundred
pounds
out
of
her
hands
,
and
give
her
common
interest
for
life
,
and
security
that
you
will
pay
her
:
 
the
Bishop
of
Clogher
,
or
any
friend
,
would
be
security
for
you
,
if
you
gave
them
counter
-
security
;
and
it
may
be
argued
that
it
will
pass
better
to
be
in
your
hands
than
hers
,
in
case
of
mortality
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
Your
mother
says
,
if
you
write
,
she
will
second
it
;
and
you
may
write
to
your
mother
,
and
then
it
will
come
from
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
tells
me
Lady
Giffard
has
a
mind
to
see
me
,
by
her
discourse
;
but
I
told
her
what
to
say
,
with
a
vengeance
.
 
<EOS>
She
told
Lady
Giffard
she
was
going
to
see
me
:
 
<EOS>
she
looks
extremely
well
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
writing
in
my
bed
like
a
tiger
;
and
so
good
-
night
,
etc
.
  
<EOS>
22
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
with
Secretary
St.
John
;
and
Lord
Dartmouth
,
who
is
t'other
Secretary
,
dined
with
us
,
and
Lord
Orrery
and
Prior
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
Harley
called
,
but
could
not
dine
with
us
,
and
would
have
had
me
away
while
I
was
at
dinner
;
but
I
did
not
like
the
company
he
was
to
have
.
 
<EOS>
We
stayed
till
eight
,
and
I
called
at
the
Coffee
-
house
,
and
looked
where
the
letters
lie
;
but
no
letter
directed
for
Mr.
Presto
:
 
at
last
<EOS>
I
saw
a
letter
to
Mr.
Addison
,
and
it
looked
like
a
rogue
's
hand
;
so
I
made
the
fellow
give
it
me
,
and
opened
it
before
him
,
and
saw
three
letters
all
for
myself
:
 
so
,
truly
,
I
put
them
in
my
pocket
,
and
came
home
to
my
lodging
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
and
so
you
shall
hear
:
 
well
,
and
<EOS>
so
I
found
one
of
them
in
Dingley
's
hand
,
and
t'other
in
Stella
's
,
and
the
third
in
Domville
's
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
so
you
shall
hear
;
so
,
said
I
to
myself
,
<EOS>
What
now
,
two
letters
from
MD
together
?
  
<EOS>
But
I
thought
there
was
something
in
the
wind
;
so
I
opened
one
,
and
I
opened
t'other
;
and
so
you
shall
hear
,
one
was
from
Walls
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
but
t'other
was
from
our
own
dear
MD
;
yes
it
was
.
 
<EOS>
O
faith
,
have
you
received
my
seventh
,
young
women
,
already
?
  
<EOS>
Then
I
must
send
this
to
-
morrow
,
else
there
will
be
old
doings
at
our
house
,
faith
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
I
wo
n't
answer
your
letter
in
this
:
 
no
,
faith
,
catch
me
at
that
,
and
I
never
saw
the
like
.
 
<EOS>
Well
;
but
as
to
Walls
,
tell
him
(
with
service
to
him
and
wife
,
etc
.
)
<EOS>
that
I
have
no
imagination
of
Mr.
Pratt
's
losing
his
place
:
 
and
while
Pratt
continues
,
Clements
is
in
no
danger
;
and
I
have
already
engaged
Lord
Hyde
he
speaks
of
,
for
Pratt
and
twenty
others
;
but
,
if
such
a
thing
should
happen
,
I
will
do
what
I
can
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
above
ten
businesses
of
other
people
's
now
on
my
hands
,
and
,
I
believe
,
shall
miscarry
in
half
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
your
sixth
I
now
have
received
.
 
<EOS>
I
writ
last
post
to
the
Bishop
of
Clogher
again
.
<EOS>
Shall
I
send
this
to
-
morrow
?
 
<EOS>
Well
,
I
will
,
to
oblige
MD
.
 
<EOS>
Which
would
you
rather
,
a
short
letter
every
week
,
or
a
long
one
every
fortnight
?
  
<EOS>
A
long
one
;
well
,
it
shall
be
done
,
and
so
good
-
night
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
but
is
this
a
long
one
?
<EOS>
No
,
I
warrant
you
:
 
too
long
for
naughty
girls
.
  
<EOS>
23
.
 
<EOS>
I
only
ask
,
have
you
got
both
the
ten
pounds
,
or
only
the
first
<EOS>
;
I
hope
you
mean
both
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
be
good
housewives
;
and
I
beg
you
to
walk
when
you
can
,
for
health
.
 
<EOS>
Have
you
the
horse
in
town
?
<EOS>
and
do
you
ever
ride
him
?
<EOS>
how
often
?
<EOS>
Confess
.
 
<EOS>
Ahhh
,
sirrah
<EOS>
,
have
I
caught
you
?
 
<EOS>
Can
you
contrive
to
let
Mrs.
Fenton
know
,
that
the
request
she
has
made
me
in
her
letter
I
will
use
what
credit
I
have
to
bring
about
,
although
I
hear
it
is
very
difficult
,
and
I
doubt
I
shall
not
succeed
?
 
<EOS>
Cox
is
not
to
be
your
Chancellor
:
 
all
joined
against
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
supping
with
Lord
Peterborow
at
his
house
,
with
Prior
,
Lewis
,
and
Dr.
Freind
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
the
ramblingest
lying
rogue
on
earth
.
 
<EOS>
Dr.
Raymond
is
come
to
town
:
 
'
tis
late
,
and
so
I
bid
you
good

night

<EOS>

.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
you
,
pretty
management
!
 
<EOS>
Ned
Southwell
told
me
the
other
day
he
had
a
letter
from
the
bishops
of
Ireland
,
with
an
address
to
the
Duke
of
Ormond
,
to
intercede
with
the
Queen
to
take
off
the
First
-
Fruits
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
with
him
to
-
day
,
and
saw
it
,
with
another
letter
to
him
from
the
Bishop
of
Kildare
,
to
call
upon
me
for
the
papers
,
etc
.
<EOS>
;
<EOS>
and
I
had
last
post
one
from
the
Archbishop
of
Dublin
,
telling
me
the
reason
of
this
proceeding
;
that
,
upon
hearing
the
Duke
of
Ormond
was
declared
Lord
Lieutenant
,
they
met
;
and
the
bishops
were
for
this
project
,
and
talked
coldly
of
my
being
solicitor
,
as
one
that
was
favoured
by
t'other
party
,
etc
.
,
but
desired
that
I
would
still
solicit
.
 
<EOS>
Now
the
wisdom
of
this
is
admirable
;
for
I
had
given
the
Archbishop
an
account
of
my
reception
from
Mr.
Harley
,
and
how
he
had
spoken
to
the
Queen
,
and
promised
it
should
be
done
;
but
Mr.
Harley
ordered
me
to
tell
no
person
alive
.
 
<EOS>
Some
time
after
,
he
gave
me
leave
to
let
the
Primate
and
Archbishop
know
that
the
Queen
had
remitted
the
First
-
Fruits
;
and
that
in
a
short
time
they
should
have
an
account
of
it
in
form
from
Lord
Dartmouth
,
Secretary
of
State
.
 
<EOS>
So
while
their
letter
was
on
the
road
to
the
Duke
of
Ormond
and
Southwell
,
mine
was
going
to
them
with
an
account
of
the
thing
being
done
.
 
<EOS>
I
writ
a
very
warm
answer
to
the
Archbishop
immediately
;
and
showed
my
resentments
,
as
I
ought
,
against
the
bishops
;
only
,
in
good
manners
,
excepting
himself
.
 
<EOS>
I
wonder
what
they
will
say
when
they
hear
the
thing
is
done
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
yesterday
forced
to
tell
Southwell
so
,
that
the
Queen
had
done
it
,
etc
.
;
for
he
said
,
my
Lord
Duke
would
think
of
it
some
months
hence
,
when
he
was
going
for
Ireland
;
and
he
had
it
three
years
in
doing
formerly
,
without
any
success
.
 
<EOS>
I
give
you
free
leave
to
say
,
on
occasion
,
that
it
is
done
;
and
that
Mr.
Harley
prevailed
on
the
Queen
to
do
it
,
etc
.
,
as
you
please
.
 
<EOS>
As
I
hope
to
live
,
I
despise
the
credit
of
it
,
out
of
an
excess
of
pride
;
and
desire
<EOS>
you
will
not
give
me
the
least
merit
when
you
talk
of
it
;
but
I
would
vex
the
bishops
,
and
have
it
spread
that
Mr.
Harley
had
done
it
:
 
<EOS>
pray
do
so
.
<EOS>
Your
mother
sent
me
last
night
a
parcel
of
wax
candles
,
and
a
bandbox
full
of
small
plumcakes
.
 
<EOS>
I
thought
it
had
been
something
for
you
;
and
,
without
opening
them
,
sent
answer
by
the
maid
that
brought
them
,
that
I
would
take
care
to
send
the
things
,
etc
.
<EOS>
;
but
I
will
write
her
thanks
.
 
<EOS>
Is
this
a
long
letter
,
sirrahs
?
  
<EOS>
Now
,
are
you
satisfied
?
  
<EOS>
I
have
had
no
fit
since
the
first
:
 
<EOS>
I
drink
brandy
every
morning
,
and
take
pills
every
night
.
 
<EOS>
Never
fear
,
I
an't
vexed
at
this
puppy
business
of
the
bishops
,
although
I
was
a
little
at
first
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
tell
you
my
reward
:
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Harley
will
think
he
has
done
me
a
favour
;
the
Duke
of
Ormond
,
perhaps
,
that
I
have
put
a
neglect
on
him
;
and
the
bishops
in
Ireland
,
that
I
have
done
nothing
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
So
goes
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
have
got
above
all
this
,
and
,
perhaps
,
I
have
better
reason
for
it
than
they
know
:
 
<EOS>
and
so
you
shall
hear
no
more
of
First
-
Fruits
,
dukes
,
Harleys
,
archbishops
,
and
Southwells
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
slipped
off
Raymond
upon
some
of
his
countrymen
,
to
show
him
the
town
,
etc
.
,
and
I
lend
him
Patrick
.
 
<EOS>
He
desires
to
sit
with
me
in
the
evenings
;
upon
which
I
have
given
Patrick
positive
orders
that
I
am
not
within
at
evenings
.

LETTER
10
.
 
<EOS>
LONDON
,
Nov.
25
,
1710
.
  
<EOS>
I
will
tell
you
something
that
's
plaguy
silly
:
 
<EOS>
I
had
forgot
to
say
on
the
23d
in
my
last
,
where
I
dined
;
and
because
I
had
done
it
constantly
,
I
thought
it
was
a
great
omission
,
and
was
going
to
interline
it
;
but
at
last
the
silliness
of
it
made
me
cry
,
<EOS>
Pshah
,
and
<EOS>
I
let
it
alone
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
to
-
day
to
see
the
Parliament
meet
;
but
only
saw
a
great
crowd
;
and
Ford
<EOS>
and
I
went
to
see
the
tombs
at
Westminster
,
and
sauntered
so
long
I
was
forced
to
go
to
an
eating
-
house
for
my
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
Bromley
is
chosen
Speaker
,
nemine
contradicente
:
 
<EOS>
Do
you
understand
those
two
words
?
  
<EOS>
And
Pompey
,
Colonel
Hill
's
black
,
designs
to
stand
Speaker
for
the
footmen
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
engaged
to
use
my
interest
for
him
,
and
have
spoken
to
Patrick
to
get
him
some
votes
.
 
<EOS>
We
are
now
all
impatient
for
the
Queen
's
speech
,
what
she
will
say
about
removing
the
Ministry
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
got
a
cold
,
and
I
do
n't
know
how
;
but
got
it
<EOS>
I
have
,
and
am
hoarse
<EOS>
:
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
whether
it
will
grow
better
or
worse
.
 
<EOS>
What
's
that
to
you
?
  
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
answer
your
letter
to
-
night
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
keep
you
a
little
longer
in
suspense
:
I
ca
n't
send
it
.
 
<EOS>
Your
mother
's
cakes
are
very
good
,
and
one
of
them
serves
me
for
a
breakfast
,
and
so
I
'll
go
sleep
like
a
good
boy
.
  
<EOS>
26
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
got
a
cruel
cold
,
and
stayed
within
all
this
day
in
my
nightgown
,
and
dined
on
sixpennyworth
of
victuals
,
and
read
and
writ
,
and
was
denied
to
everybody
.
 
<EOS>
Dr.
Raymond
called
often
,
and
I
was
denied
;
and
at
last
,
when
I
was
weary
,
I
let
him
come
up
,
and
asked
him
,
without
consequence
,
how
Patrick
denied
me
,
and
whether
he
had
the
art
of
it
?
 
<EOS>
So
by
this
means
he
shall
be
used
to
have
me
denied
to
him
;
otherwise
he
would
be
a
plaguy
trouble
and
hindrance
to
me
:
 
<EOS>
he
has
sat
with
me
two
hours
,
and
drank
a
pint
of
ale
cost
me
fivepence
,
and
smoked
his
pipe
,
and
it
is
now
past
eleven
that
he
is
just
gone
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
my
eighth
is
with
you
now
,
young
women
;
and
your
seventh
to
me
is
somewhere
in
a
post
-
boy
's
bag
;
and
so
go
to
your
gang
of
deans
,
and
Stoytes
,
and
Walls
,
and
lose
your
money
;
go
,
sauceboxes
:
 
and
so
good
-
night
,
and
be
happy
,
dear
rogues
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
but
your
box
was
sent
to
Dr.
Hawkshaw
by
Sterne
,
and
you
will
have
it
with
Hawkshaw
,
and
spectacles
,
etc
.
,
etc
.
  
<EOS>
27
.
 
<EOS>
To
-
day
Mr.
Harley
met
me
in
the
Court
of
Requests
,
and
whispered
me
to
dine
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
At
dinner
I
told
him
what
those
bishops
had
done
,
and
the
difficulty
I
was
under
.
 
<EOS>
He
bid
me
never
trouble
myself
;
he
would
tell
the
Duke
of
Ormond
<EOS>
the
business
was
done
,
and
that
he
need
not
concern
himself
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
So
now
I
am
easy
,
and
they
may
hang
themselves
for
a
parcel
of
insolent
,
ungrateful
rascals
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
I
told
you
in
my
last
,
how
they
sent
an
address
to
the
Duke
of
Ormond
,
and
a
letter
to
Southwell
,
to
call
on
me
for
the
papers
,
after
the
thing
was
over
;
but
they
had
not
received
my
letter
,
though
the
Archbishop
might
,
by
what
I
writ
to
him
,
have
expected
it
would
be
done
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
there
is
an
end
of
that
;
and
in
a
little
time
the
Queen
will
send
them
notice
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
the
methods
will
be
settled
;
and
then
I
shall
think
of
returning
,
although
the
baseness
of
those
bishops
makes
me
love
Ireland
less
than
I
did
.
  
<EOS>
28
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Halifax
sent
to
invite
me
to
dinner
;
where
I
stayed
till
six
,
and
crossed
him
in
all
his
Whig
talk
,
and
made
him
often
come
over
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
he
makes
court
to
the
new
men
,
although
he
affects
to
talk
like
a
Whig
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
a
letter
to
-
day
from
the
Bishop
of
Clogher
;
but
I
writ
to
him
lately
,
that
I
would
obey
his
commands
to
the
Duke
of
Ormond
.
 
<EOS>
He
says
I
bid
him
read
the
London
"
Shaver
,
"
and
that
you
both
swore
it
was
"
Shaver
,
"
and
not
"
Shower
.
<EOS>
"
You
all
lie
,
and
you
are
puppies
,
and
ca
n't
read
Presto
's
hand
.
 
<EOS>
The
Bishop
is
out
entirely
in
his
conjectures
of
my
share
in
the
Tatlers
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
other
things
to
mind
,
and
of
much
greater
importance
;
else
I
have
little
to
do
to
be
acquainted
with
a
new
Ministry
,
who
consider
me
a
little
more
than
Irish
bishops
do
.
  
<EOS>
29
.
 
<EOS>
Now
for
your
saucy
,
good
dear
letter
:
 
<EOS>
let
me
see
<EOS>
,
what
does
it
say
?
<EOS>
come
then
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
to
-
day
with
Ford
,
and
went
home
early
;
he
debauched
me
to
his
chamber
again
with
a
bottle
of
wine
till
twelve
:
 
so
good
-
night
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
write
an
answer
now
,
you
rogues
.
  
<EOS>
30
.
 
<EOS>
To
-
day
I
have
been
visiting
,
which
I
had
long
neglected
;
and
I
dined
with
Mrs.
Barton
alone
;
and
sauntered
at
the
Coffee
-
house
till
past
eight
,
and
have
been
busy
till
eleven
,
and
now
I
'll
answer
your
letter
,
saucebox
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
let
me
see
now
again
.
 
<EOS>
My
wax
candle
's
almost
out
,
but
however
I
'll
begin
.
 
<EOS>
Well
then
,
do
not
be
so
tedious
,
Mr.
Presto
;
what
can
you
say
to
MD
's
letter
?
 
<EOS>
Make
haste
,
have
done
with
your
preambles
 
<EOS>
Why
,
I
say
I
am
glad
you
are
so
often
abroad
;
your
mother
thinks
it
is
want
of
exercise
hurts
you
,
and
so
do
I.
<EOS>
(
She
called
here
to
-
night
,
but
I
was
not
within
,
that
's
by
the
bye
.
)
 
<EOS>
Sure
you
do
not
deceive
me
,
Stella
,
when
you
say
you
are
in
better
health
than
you
were
these
three
weeks
;
for
Dr.
 
Raymond
told
me
yesterday
,
that
Smyth
of
the
Blind
Quay
had
been
telling
Mr.
Leigh
that
he
left
you
extremely
ill
;
and
in
short
,
spoke
so
,
that
he
almost
put
poor
Leigh
into
tears
,
and
would
have
made
me
run
distracted
;
though
your
letter
is
dated
the
11th
instant
,
and
I
saw
Smyth
in
the
city
above
a
fortnight
ago
,
as
I
passed
by
in
a
coach
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
,
pray
,
do
n't
write
,
Stella
,
until
you
are
mighty
,
mighty
,
mighty
,
mighty
well
in
your
eyes
,
and
are
sure
it
wo
n't
do
you
the
least
hurt
.
 
<EOS>
Or
come
,
I
'll
tell
you
what
;
you
,
Mistress
Stella
,
shall
write
your
share
at
five
or
six
sittings
,
one
sitting
a
day
;
and
then
comes
Dingley
all
together
,
and
then
Stella
a
little
crumb
towards
the
end
,
to
let
us
see
she
remembers
Presto
;
and
then
conclude
with
something
handsome
and
genteel
,
as
your
most
humblecumdumble
,
or
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
O
Lord
!
 
<EOS>
does
Patrick
write
word
of
my
not
coming
till
spring
?
 
<EOS>
Insolent
man
!
<EOS>
he
know
my
secrets
?
 
<EOS>
No
;
as
my
Lord
Mayor
said
,
No
;
if
I
thought
my
shirt
knew
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
Faith
,
I
will
come
as
soon
as
it
is
any
way
proper
for
me
to
come
;
but
,
to
say
the
truth
,
I
am
at
present
a
little
involved
with
the
present
Ministry
in
some
certain
things
(
which
I
tell
you
as
a
secret
)
;
and
soon
as
ever
I
can
clear
my
hands
,
I
will
stay
no
longer
;
for
I
hope
the
First
-
Fruit
business
will
be
soon
over
in
all
its
forms
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
to
say
the
truth
,
the
present
Ministry
have
a
difficult
task
,
and
want
me
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
they
may
be
just
as
grateful
as
others
:
 
but
,
according
to
the
best
judgment
I
have
,
they
are
pursuing
the
true
interest
of
the
public
;
and
therefore
I
am
glad
to
contribute
what
is
in
my
power
.
 
<EOS>
For
God
's
sake
,
not
a
word
of
this
to
any
alive
.
 
<EOS>
Your
Chancellor
?
 
<EOS>
Why
,
madam
,
I
can
tell
you
he
has
been
dead
this
fortnight
.
 
<EOS>
Faith
,
I
could
hardly
forbear
our
little
language
about
a
nasty
dead
Chancellor
,
as
you
may
see
by
the
blot
.
 
<EOS>
Ploughing
?
  
<EOS>
A
pox
plough
them
;
they
'll
plough
me
to
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
But
have
you
got
your
money
,
<EOS>
both
the
ten
pounds
?
 
<EOS>
How
durst
he
pay
you
the
second
so
soon
?
  
<EOS>
Pray
be
good
huswifes
.
<EOS>
Ay
,
well
,
and
Joe
,
why
,
I
had
a
letter
lately
from
Joe
,
desiring
I
would
take
some
care
of
their
poor
town
,
who
,
he
says
,
will
lose
their
liberties
.
 
<EOS>
To
which
I
desired
Dr.
Raymond
would
return
answer
,
that
the
town
had
behaved
themselves
so
ill
to
me
,
so
little
regarded
the
advice
I
gave
them
,
and
disagreed
so
much
among
themselves
,
that
I
was
resolved
never
to
have
more
to
do
with
them
;
but
that
whatever
personal
kindness
I
could
do
to
Joe
,
should
be
done
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
,
when
you
happen
to
see
Joe
,
tell
him
this
,
lest
Raymond
should
have
blundered
or
forgotten
 
Poor
Mrs.
Wesley
!
 
<EOS>
Why
these
poligyes
for
being
abroad
?
 
<EOS>
Why
should
you
be
at
home
at
all
,
until
Stella
is
quite
well
?
  
<EOS>
So
,
here
is
Mistress
Stella
again
,
with
her
two
eggs
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
My
"
Shower
"
admired
with
you
;
why
,
the
Bishop
of
Clogher
says
,
he
has
seen
something
of
mine
of
the
same
sort
,
better
than
the
"
Shower
.
"
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
he
means
"
The
Morning
"
;
but
it
is
not
half
so
good
.
 
<EOS>
I
want
your
judgment
of
things
,
and
not
your
country
's
.
 
<EOS>
How
does
MD
like
it
?
<EOS>
and
do
they
taste
it
ALL
?
<EOS>
etc
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
glad
Dean
Bolton
has
paid
the
twenty
pounds
.
 
<EOS>
Why
should
not
I
chide
the
Bishop
of
Clogher
for
writing
to
the
Archbishop
of
Cashel
,
without
sending
the
letter
first
to
me
?
  
<EOS>
It
does
not
signify
a
#

;
 
for
he
has
no
credit
at
Court
.
 
<EOS>
Stuff
 
<EOS>
they
are
all
puppies
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
break
your
head
in
good
earnest
,
young
woman
,
for
your
nasty
jest
about
Mrs.
Barton
.
 
<EOS>
Unlucky
sluttikin
,
what
a
word
is
there
!
  
<EOS>
Faith
,
I
was
thinking
yesterday
,
when
I
was
with
her
,
whether
she
could
break
them
or
no
,
and
it
quite
spoilt
my
imagination
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Walls
,
does
Stella
win
as
she
pretends
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
indeed
,
Doctor
;
she
loses
always
,
and
will
play
so
VENTERSOMELY
,
how
can
she
win
?
"
 
<EOS>
See
here
now
;
an't
you
<EOS>
an
impudent
lying
slut
?
 
<EOS>
Do
,
open
Domville
's
letter
;
what
does
it
signify
,
if
you
have
a
mind
?
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
faith
,
you
write
smartly
with
your
eyes
shut
;
all
was
well
but
the
n.
 
<EOS>
See
how
I
can
do
it
;
MADAM
STELLA
,
YOUR
HUMBLE
SERVANT
.
 
<EOS>
O
,
but
one
may
look
whether
one
goes
crooked
or
no
,
and
so
write
on
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
tell
you
what
you
may
do
;
you
may
write
with
your
eyes
<EOS>
half
shut
,
just
as
when
one
is
going
to
sleep
:
 
<EOS>
I
have
done
so
for
two
or
three
lines
now
;
it
is
but
just
seeing
enough
to
go
straight
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
Madam
Dingley
,
I
think
I
bid
you
tell
Mr.
Walls
that
,
in
case
there
be
occasion
,
I
will
serve
his
friend
as
far
as
I
can
;
but
I
hope
there
will
be
none
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
I
believe
you
will
have
a
new
Parliament
;
but
I
care
not
whether
you
have
or
no
a
better
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
mistaken
in
all
your
conjectures
about
the
Tatlers
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
given
him
one
or
two
hints
,
and
you
have
heard
me
talk
about
the
Shilling
.
 
<EOS>
Faith
,
these
answering
letters
are
very
long
ones
:
 
<EOS>
you
have
taken
up
almost
the
room
of
a
week
in
journals
;
and
I
will
tell
you
what
,
I
saw
fellows
wearing
crosses
to-
day
,
and
I
wondered
what
was
the
matter
;
but
just
this
minute
I
recollect
it
is
little
Presto
's
birthday
;
and
I
was
resolved
these
three
days
to
remember
it
when
it
came
,
but
could
not
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
,
drink
my
health
to
-
day
at
dinner
;
do
,
you
rogues
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
like
"
Sid
Hamet
's
Rod
"
?
  
<EOS>
Do
you
understand
it
all
?
 
<EOS>
Well
,
now
at
last
I
have
done
with
your
letter
,
and
so
I
will
lay
me
down
to
sleep
,
and
about
,
fair
maids
;
and
<EOS>
I
hope
merry
maids
all
.

Dec.

.
 
<EOS>
Morning
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
Smyth
were
hanged
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
dreaming
the
most
melancholy
things
in
the
world
of
poor
Stella
,
and
was
grieving
and
crying
all
night
.
 
<EOS>
Pshah
,
it
is
foolish
:
 
I
will
rise
and
divert
myself
;
so
good
-
morrow
;
and
God
of
His
infinite
mercy
keep
and
protect
you
!
 
<EOS>
The
Bishop
of
Clogher
's
letter
is
dated
Nov.
21
.
 
<EOS>
He
says
you
thought
of
going
with
him
to
Clogher
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
heartily
glad
of
it
,
and
wish
you
would
ride
there
,
and
Dingley
go
in
a
coach
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
had
no
fit
since
my
first
,
although
sometimes
my
head
is
not
quite
in
good
order
.
 
<EOS>
At
night
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
this
morning
to
visit
Mr.
Pratt
,
who
is
come
over
with
poor
,
sick
Lord
Shelburne
:
 
<EOS>
they
made
me
dine
with
them
;
and
there
I
stayed
,
like
a
booby
,
till
eight
,
looking
over
them
at
ombre
,
and
then
came
home
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Shelburne
's
giddiness
is
turned
into
a
colic
,
and
he
looks
miserably
.
  
<EOS>

.
 
<EOS>
Steele
,
the
rogue
,
has
done
the
imprudentest
thing
in
the
world
:
 
<EOS>
he
said
something
in
a
Tatler
,
that
we
ought
to
use
the
word
Great
Britain
,
and
not
England
,
in
common
conversation
,
as
,
"
The
finest
lady
in
Great
Britain
,
"
etc
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
this
,
Rowe
,
Prior
,
and
<EOS>
I
sent
him
a
letter
,
turning
this
into
ridicule
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
to
-
day
printed
the
letter
,
and
signed
it
J.S.
,
M.P.
,
and
N.R.
,
<EOS>
the
first
letters
of
all
our
names
.
 
<EOS>
Congreve
told
me
to
-
day
,
he
smoked
it
immediately
.
 
<EOS>
Congreve
and
I
,
and
Sir
Charles
Wager
,
dined
to
-
day
at
Delaval
's
,
the
Portugal
Envoy
;
and
I
stayed
there
till
eight
,
and
came
home
,
and
am
now
writing
to
you
before
I
do
business
,
because
that
dog
Patrick
is
not
at
home
,
and
the
fire
is
not
made
,
and
I
am
not
in
my
gear
.
 
<EOS>
Pox
take
him
!
 
<EOS>
I
was
looking
by
chance
at
the
top
of
this
side
,
and
find
I
make
plaguy
mistakes
in
words
;
so
that
you
must
fence
against
that
as
well
as
bad
writing
.
<EOS>
Faith
,
I
ca
n't
nor
wo
n't
read
what
I
have
written
.
 
<EOS>
(
Pox
of
this
puppy
!
)
<EOS>
Well
,
I
'll
leave
you
till
I
am
got
to
bed
,
and
then
I
will
say
a
word
or
two
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
'
tis
now
almost
twelve
,
and
I
have
been
busy
ever
since
,
by
a
fire
too
<EOS>
(
I
have
my
coals
by
half
a
bushel
at
a
time
,
I
'll
assure
you
)
,
and
now
I
am
got
to
bed
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
and
what
have
you
to
say
to
Presto
now
he
is
abed
?
 
<EOS>
Come
now
,
let
us
hear
your
speeches
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
'
tis
a
lie
<EOS>
;
I
an't
sleepy
yet
.
 
<EOS>
Let
us
sit
up
a
little
longer
,
and
talk
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
where
have
you
been
to
-
day
,
that
you
are
<EOS>
but
just
this
minute
come
home
in
a
coach
?
 
<EOS>
What
have
you
lost
?
 
<EOS>
Pay
the
coachman
,
Stella
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
faith
,
not
<EOS>
I
,
he
'll
grumble
.
 
<EOS>
What
new
acquaintance
have
you
got
?
<EOS>
come
,
let
us
hear
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
made
Delaval
promise
to
send
me
some
Brazil
tobacco
from
Portugal
for
you
,
Madam
Dingley
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
you
will
have
your
chocolate
and
spectacles
before
this
comes
to
you
.
  
<EOS>

.
 
<EOS>
Pshaw
,
I
must
be
writing
to
these
dear
saucy
brats
every
night
,
whether
I
will
or
no
,
let
me
have
what
business
I
will
,
or
come
home
ever
so
late
,
or
be
ever
so
sleepy
;
but
an
old
saying
,
and
a
true
one
,
       
<EOS>
"
Be
you
lords
,
or
be
you
earls
,
      
<EOS>
You
must
write
to
naughty
girls
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
was
to
-
day
at
Court
,
and
saw
Raymond
among
the
Beefeaters
,
staying
to
see
the
Queen
:
 
<EOS>
so
I
put
him
in
a
better
station
,
made
two
or
three
dozen
of
bows
,
and
went
to
church
,
and
then
to
Court
again
,
to
pick
up
a
dinner
,
as
I
did
with
Sir
John
Stanley
;
and
then
we
went
to
visit
Lord
Mountjoy
,
and
just
now
left
him
;
and
'
tis
near
eleven
at
night
,
young
women
;
and
methinks
this
letter
comes
pretty
near
to
the
bottom
,
and
'
tis
but
eight
days
since
the
date
,
and
do
n't
think
I
'll
write
on
the
other
side
,
I
thank
you
for
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
Faith
,
if
I
would
use
you
to
letters
on
sheets
as
broad
as
this
room
,
you
would
always
expect
them
from
me
.
 
<EOS>
O
,
faith
<EOS>
,
I
know
you
well
enough
;
but
an
old
saying
,
etc
.
,
       
"
Two
sides
in
a
sheet
,
      
And
one
in
a
street
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
think
that
's
but
a
silly
old
saying
;
and
so
I
'll
go
to
sleep
,
and
do
you
so
too
.
  
<EOS>

.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
to
-
day
with
Mrs.
Vanhomrigh
,
and
then
came
home
,
and
studied
till
eleven
.
 
<EOS>
No
adventure
at
all
to
-
day
.
  
<EOS>

.
 
<EOS>
So
I
went
to
the
Court
of
Requests
<EOS>
(
we
have
had
the
Devil
and
all
of
rain
by
the
bye
)
to
pick
up
a
dinner
;
and
Henley
made
me
go
dine
with
him
and
one
Colonel
Bragg
at
a
tavern
;
cost
me
money
,
faith
.
 
<EOS>
Congreve
was
to
be
there
,
but
came
not
.
 
<EOS>
I
came
with
Henley
to
the
Coffee
-
house
,
where
Lord
Salisbury
seemed
mighty
desirous
to
talk
with
me
;
and
,
while
he
was
wriggling
himself
into
my
favour
<EOS>
,
that
dog
Henley
asked
me
aloud
,
whether
I
would
go
to
see
Lord
Somers
as
I
had
promised
(
which
was
a
lie
)
;
and
all
to
vex
poor
Lord
Salisbury
,
who
is
a
high
Tory
.
 
<EOS>
He
played
two
or
three
other
such
tricks
;
and
I
was
forced
to
leave
my
lord
,
and
I
came
home
at
seven
,
and
have
been
writing
ever
since
,
and
will
now
go
to
bed
.
 
<EOS>
The
other
day
I
saw
Jack
Temple
in
the
Court
of
Requests
:
 
<EOS>
it
was
the
first
time
of
seeing
him
;
so
we
talked
two
or
three
careless
words
,
and
parted
.
 
<EOS>
Is
it
true
that
your
Recorder
and
Mayor
,
and
fanatic
aldermen
,
<EOS>
a
month
or
two
ago
,
at
a
solemn
feast
,
drank
Mr.
Harley
's
,
Lord
Rochester
's
,
and
other
Tory
healths
?
 
<EOS>
Let
me
know
;
it
was
confidently
said
here
.
 
<EOS>
The
scoundrels
!
 
<EOS>
It
sha
n't
do
,
Tom
.
  
<EOS>
6
.
 
<EOS>
When
is
this
letter
to
go
,
I
wonder
?
 
<EOS>
harkee
,
young
women
,
tell
me
that
.
<EOS>
Saturday
next
for
certain
,
and
not
before
:
 
then
it
will
be
just
a
fortnight
;
time
enough
for
naughty
girls
,
and
long
enough
for
two
letters
,
faith
.
<EOS>
Congreve
and
Delaval
have
at
last
prevailed
on
Sir
Godfrey
Kneller
to
entreat
me
to
let
him
draw
my
picture
for
nothing
;
but
I
know
not
yet
when
I
shall
sit
.
 
<EOS>
I
t
is
such
monstrous
rainy
weather
,
that
there
is
no
doing
with
it
.
<EOS>
Secretary
St.
John
sent
to
me
this
morning
,
that
my
dining
with
him
to
-
day
was
put
off
till
to
-
morrow
;
so
I
peaceably
sat
with
my
neighbour
Ford
,
dined
with
him
,
and
came
home
at
six
,
and
am
now
in
bed
as
usual
;
and
now
it
is
time
to
have
another
letter
from
MD
,
yet
I
would
not
have
it
till
this
goes
;
for
that
would
look
like
two
letters
for
one
.
 
<EOS>
Is
it
not
whimsical
that
the
Dean
has
never
once
written
to
me
?
 
<EOS>
And
I
find
the
Archbishop
very
silent
to
that
letter
<EOS>
I
sent
him
with
an
account
that
the
business
was
done
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
he
knows
not
what
to
write
or
say
;
and
I
have
since
written
twice
to
him
,
both
times
with
a
vengeance
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
go
to
bed
,
sirrahs
,
and
so
will
I.
 
<EOS>
But
have
you
lost
to
-
day
?
 
<EOS>
Three
shillings
!
 
<EOS>
O
fie
,
O
fie
!
  
<EOS>
7
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
I
wo
n't
send
this
letter
to
-
day
,
nor
till
Saturday
,
faith
;
and
I
am
so
afraid
of
one
from
MD
between
this
and
that
<EOS>
;
if
it
comes
,
I
will
just
say
I
received
a
letter
,
and
that
is
all
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
to
-
day
with
Mr.
Secretary
St.
John
,
where
were
Lord
Anglesea
,
Sir
Thomas
Hanmer
,
Prior
,
Freind
,
etc
.
,
and
then
made
a
debauch
after
nine
at
Prior
's
house
,
and
have
eaten
cold
pie
,
and
I
hate
the
thoughts
of
it
,
and
I
am
full
,
and
I
do
n't
like
it
,
and
I
will
go
to
bed
,
and
it
is
late
,
and
so
good
-
night
.
  
<EOS>
8
.
 
<EOS>
To
-
day
I
dined
with
Mr.
Harley
and
Prior
;
but
Mr.
St.
John
did
not
come
,
though
he
promised
:
 
<EOS>
he
chid
me
for
not
seeing
him
oftener
.
 
<EOS>
Here
is
a
damned
,
libellous
pamphlet
come
out
against
Lord
Wharton
,
giving
the
character
first
,
and
then
telling
some
of
his
actions
:
 
the
character
is
very
well
,
but
the
facts
indifferent
.

It
has
been
sent
by
dozens
to
several
gentlemen
's
lodgings
,
and
I
had
one
or
two
of
them
;
but
nobody
knows
the
author
or
printer
.
 
<EOS>
We
are
terribly
afraid
of
the
plague
;
they
say
it
is
at
Newcastle
.
 
<EOS>
I
begged
Mr.
Harley
for
the
love
of
God
to
take
some
care
about
it
,
or
we
are
all
ruined
.
 
<EOS>
There
have
been
orders
for
all
ships
from
the
Baltic
to
pass
their
quarantine
before
they
land
;
but
they
neglect
it
.
 
<EOS>
You
remember
I
have
been
afraid
these
two
years
.

<EOS>
O
,
faith
<EOS>
,
you
are
a
saucy
rogue
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
had
your
sixth
letter
just
now
,
before
this
is
gone
;
but
I
will
not
answer
a
word
of
it
,
only
that
I
never
was
giddy
since
my
first
fit
;
but
I
have
had
a
cold
just
a
fortnight
,
and
cough
with
it
still
morning
and
evening
;
but
it
will
go
off
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
,
however
,
such
abominable
weather
that
no
creature
can
walk
.
 
<EOS>
They
say
here
three
of
your
Commissioners
will
be
turned
out
,
Ogle
,
South
,
and
St.
Quintin
;
and
that
Dick
Stewart
and
Ludlow
will
be
two
of
the
new
ones
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
a
little
soliciting
for
another
:
 
<EOS>
it
is
poor
Lord
Abercorn
,
but
that
is
a
secret
;
I
mean
,
that
I
befriend
him
is
a
secret
;
but
I
believe
it
is
too
late
,
by
his
own
fault
and
ill
fortune
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
with
him
to
-
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
heartily
sorry
you
do
not
go
to
Clogher
,
faith
,
I
am
;
and
so
God
Almighty
protect
poor
,
dear
,
dear
,
dear
,
dearest
MD
.
 
<EOS>
Farewell
till
to
-
night
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
begin
my
eleventh
to

night
;
so
I
am
always
writing
to
little
MD

LONDON
,
Dec.

1710
.
  
<EOS>
So
,
young
women
,
I
have
just
sent
my
tenth
to
the
post
-
office
,
and
,
as
I
told
you
,
have
received
your
seventh
(
faith
<EOS>
,
I
am
afraid
I
mistook
,
and
said
your
sixth
,
and
then
we
shall
be
all
in
confusion
this
month
.
)
 
<EOS>
Well
,
I
told
you
I
dined
with
Lord
Abercorn
to
-
day
;
and
that
is
enough
till
by
and
bye
;
for
I
must
go
write
idle
things
,
and
twittle
twattle
.
 
<EOS>
What
's
here
to
do
with
your
little
MD
's
?
 
<EOS>
and
so
I
put
this
by
for
a
while
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
now
late
,
and
<EOS>
I
can
only
say
MD
is
a
dear
,
saucy
rogue
,
and
what
then
?
 
<EOS>
Presto
loves
them
the
better
.

This
son

Patrick
is
out
of
the
way
,
and
I
can
do
nothing
;
am
forced
to
borrow
coals
:
 
'
tis
now
six
o'clock
,
and
I
am
come
home
after
a
pure
walk
in
the
park
;
delicate
weather
,
begun
only
to
-
day
.
 
<EOS>
A
terrible
storm
last
night
:
 
<EOS>
we
hear
one
of
your
packet
-
boats
is
cast
away
,
and
young
Beau
Swift
in
it
,
and
General
Sankey
:
 
<EOS>
I
know
not
the
truth
;
you
will
before
me
.
<EOS>
Raymond
talks
of
leaving
the
town
in
a
few
days
,
and
going
in
a
month
to
Ireland
,
for
fear
his
wife
should
be
too
far
gone
,
and
forced
to
be
brought
to
bed
here
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
he
is
in
the
right
;
but
perhaps
this
packet
-
boat
will
fright
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
no
relish
for
London
;
and
I
do
not
wonder
at
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
got
some
Templars
from
Ireland
that
show
him
the
town
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
let
him
see
me
above
twice
a
week
,
and
that
only
while
I
am
dressing
in
the
morning
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
now
the
puppy
's
come
in
,
and
I
have
got
my
own
ink
,
but
a
new
pen
;
and
so
now
you
are
rogues
and
sauceboxes
<EOS>
till
I
go
to
bed
;
for
I
must
go
study
,
sirrahs
.
<EOS>
Now
I
think
of
it
,
tell
the
Bishop
of
Clogher
,
he
shall
not
cheat
me
of
one
inch
of
my
bell
metal
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
it
is
nothing
but
to
save
the
town
money
;
and
Enniskillen
can
afford
it
better
than
Laracor
:
 
<EOS>
he
shall
have
<EOS>
but
one
thousand
five
hundred
weight
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
reading
,
etc
.
,
as
usual
,
and
am
now
going
to
bed
;
and
I
find
this
day
's
article
is
long
enough
:
 
<EOS>
so
get
you
gone
till
to
-
morrow
,
and
then
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
with
Sir
Matthew
Dudley
.
  
<EOS>
11
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
come
home
again
as
yesterday
,
and
the
puppy
had
again
locked
up
my
ink
,
notwithstanding
all
I
said
to
him
yesterday
;
but
he
came
home
a
little
after
me
,
so
all
is
well
:
 
<EOS>
they
are
lighting
my
fire
,
and
I
'll
go
study
.
 
<EOS>
The
fair
weather
is
gone
again
,
and
it
has
rained
all
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
like
this
open
weather
,
though
some
say
it
is
healthy
.
 
<EOS>
They
say
it
is
a
false
report
about
the
plague
at
Newcastle
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
news
to
-
day
:
 
<EOS>
I
dined
with
Mrs.
Vanhomrigh
,
to
desire
them
to
buy
me
a
scarf
;
and
Lady
Abercorn
is
to
buy
me
another
,
to
see
who
does
best
:
 
mine
is
all
in
rags
.
 
<EOS>
I
saw
the
Duke
of
Richmond
yesterday
at
Court
again
,
but
would
not
speak
to
him
:
 
<EOS>
I
believe
we
are
fallen
out
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
now
in
bed
;
and
it
has
rained
all
this
evening
,
like
wildfire
:
 
<EOS>
have
you
so
much
rain
in
your
town
?
 
<EOS>
Raymond
was
in
a
fright
,
as
I
expected
,
upon
the
news
of
this
shipwreck
;
but
I
persuaded
him
,
and
he
leaves
this
town
in
a
week
.
 
<EOS>
I
got
him
acquainted
with
Sir
Robert
Raymond
,
the
Solicitor
-
General
,
who
owns
him
to
be
of
his
family
;
and
I
believe
it
may
do
him
a
kindness
,
by
being
recommended
to
your
new
Lord
Chancellor
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
a
letter
from
Mrs.
Long
<EOS>
,
that
has
quite
turned
my
stomach
against
her
:
 
<EOS>
no
less
than
two
nasty
jests
in
it
,
with
dashes
to
suppose
them
.
 
<EOS>
She
is
corrupted
in
that
country
town
with
vile
conversation
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
not
answer
your
letter
till
I
have
leisure
:
 
<EOS>
so
let
this
go
on
as
it
will
<EOS>
,
what
care
I
?
<EOS>
what
cares
saucy
Presto
?
  
<EOS>

.
 
<EOS>
I
was
to
-
day
at
the
Secretary
's
office
with
Lewis
,
and
in
came
Lord
Rivers
;
who
took
Lewis
out
and
whispered
him
;
and
then
came
up
to
me
to
desire
my
acquaintance
,
<EOS>
etc
.
<EOS>
,
so
we
bowed
and
complimented
a
while
,
and
parted
<EOS>
and
I
dined
with
Phil
.
<EOS>
Savage
and
his
Irish
Club
,
at
their
boarding
-
place
;
and
,
passing
an
evening
scurvily
enough
,
did
not
come
home
till
eight
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Addison
and
I
hardly
meet
once
a
fortnight
;
his
Parliament
and
my
different
friendships
keep
us
asunder
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
Matthew
Dudley
turned
away
his
butler
yesterday
morning
;
and
at
night
the
poor
fellow
died
suddenly
in
the
streets
:
was
not
it
an
odd
event
?
 
<EOS>
But
what
care
you
?
 
<EOS>
But
then
I
knew
the
butler
.
  
<EOS>
Why
,
it
seems
your
packet
-
boat
is
not
lost
:
 
psha
,
how
silly
that
is
,
when
I
had
already
gone
through
the
forms
,
and
said
it
was
a
sad
thing
,
and
that
I
was
sorry
for
it
!
 
<EOS>
But
when
must
I
answer
this
letter
of
our
MD
's
?
 
<EOS>
Here
it
is
,
it
lies
between
this
paper
on
t'other
side
of
the
leaf
:
 
one
of
these
odd-
<EOS>
come
-
shortly
's
<EOS>
I
'll
consider
,
and
so
good
-
night
.
  
<EOS>

<EOS>
Morning
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
to
go
trapesing
with
Lady
Kerry
and
Mrs.
Pratt
to
see
sights
all
this
day
:
 
<EOS>
they
engaged
me
yesterday
morning
at
tea
.
 
<EOS>
You
hear
the
havoc
making
in
the
army
:
 
Meredith
,
Maccartney
,
and
Colonel
Honeywood
are
obliged
to
sell
their
commands
at
half
-
value
,
and
leave
the
army
,
for
drinking
destruction
to
the
present
Ministry
,
and
dressing
up
a
hat
on
a
stick
,
and
calling
it
Harley
;
then
drinking
a
glass
with
one
hand
,
and
discharging
a
pistol
with
the
other
at
the
maukin
,
wishing
it
were
Harley
himself
;
and
a
hundred
other
such
pretty
tricks
,
as
inflaming
their
soldiers
,
and
foreign
Ministers
,
against
the
late
changes
at
Court
.
 
<EOS>
Cadogan
has
had
a
little
paring
:
 
his
mother
told
me
yesterday
he
had
lost
the
place
of
Envoy
;
but
I
hope
they
will
go
no
further
with
him
,
for
he
was
not
at
those
mutinous
meetings
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
these
saucy
jades
take
up
so
much
of
my
time
with
writing
to
them
in
a
morning
;
but
,
faith
,
I
am
glad
to
see
you
whenever
I
can
:
a
little
snap
and
away
;
and
so
hold
your
tongue
,
for
I
must
rise
:
 
not
a
word
,
for
your
life
.
 
<EOS>
How
nowww
?
 
<EOS>
So
,
very
well
;
stay
till
I
come
home
,
and
then
,
perhaps
,
you
may
hear
further
from
me
.
 
<EOS>
And
where
will
you
go
to
-
day
,
for
I
ca
n't
be
with
you
for
these
ladies
?
 
<EOS>
It
is
a
rainy
,
ugly
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
'd
have
you
send
for
Walls
,
and
go
to
the
Dean
's
;
but
do
n't
play
small
games
when
you
lose
.
 
<EOS>
You
'll
be
ruined
by
Manilio
,
Basto
,
the
queen
,
and
two
small
trumps
,
in
red
.
 
<EOS>
I
confess
'
<EOS>
tis
a
good
hand
against
the
player
:
 
<EOS>
but
then
there
are
Spadilio
,
Punto
,
the
king
,
strong
trumps
,
against
you
,
which
,
with
one
trump
more
,
are
three
tricks
ten
ace
:
 
for
,
suppose
you
play
your
Manilio
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
silly
,
how
I
prate
,
and
ca
n't
get
away
from
this
MD
in
a
morning
!
 
<EOS>
Go
,
get
you
gone
,
dear
naughty
girls
,
and
let
me
rise
.
 
<EOS>
There
,
Patrick
locked
up
my
ink
again
the
third
time
last
night
:
 
<EOS>
the
rogue
gets
the
better
of
me
;
but
I
will
rise
in
spite
of
you
,
sirrahs
.
 
<EOS>
At
night

<EOS>
Lady
Kerry
,
Mrs.
Pratt
,
Mrs.
Cadogan

and
I

in
one
coach

Lady
Kerry

his
governor

and
two
gentlemen

little

<EOS>
(
Lord
Shelburne
's
children

in
a
third

all
hackneys

set
out
at
ten
o'clock
this
morning
from
Lord
Shelburne
's
house
in
Piccadilly
to
the
Tower
,
and
saw
all
the
sights
,
lions
,
etc
.
;
then
to
Bedlam
<EOS>
;
then
dined
at
the
chop
-
house
behind
the
Exchange
;
then
to
Gresham
College
(
but
the
keeper
was
not
at
home
)
;
and
concluded
the
night
at
the
Puppet
-
show
,
<EOS>
whence
we
came
home
safe
at
eight
,
and
I
left
them
.
 
<EOS>
The
ladies
were
all
in
mobs
(
how
do
you
call
it
?
)
,
undrest
;
and
it
was
the
rainiest
day
that
ever
dripped
;
and
I
am
weary
;
and
it
is
now
past
eleven
.
  
<EOS>
14
.
 
<EOS>
Stay
,
I
'll
answer
some
of
your
letter
this
morning
in
bed
:
 
<EOS>
let
me
see
;
come
and
appear
,
<EOS>
little
letter
.
 
<EOS>
Here
I
am
,
says
he
:
 
<EOS>
and
what
say
you
to
Mrs.
MD
this
morning
fresh
and
fasting
?
 
<EOS>
Who
dares
think
MD
negligent
?
 
<EOS>
I
allow
them
a
fortnight
;
and
they
give
it
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
fill
a
letter
in
a
week
;
but
it
is
longer
every
day
;
and
so
I
keep
it
a
fortnight
,
and
then
'
tis
cheaper
by
one
half
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
never
been
giddy
,
dear
Stella
,
since
that
morning
:
 
<EOS>
I
have
taken
a
whole
box
of
pills
,
and
kecked
at
them
every
night
,
and
drank
a
pint
of
brandy
at
mornings
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
then
,
you
kept
Presto
's
little
birthday
:
<EOS>
would
to
God
<EOS>
I
had
been
with
you
!
 
<EOS>
I
forgot
it
,
as
I
told
you
before
.
<EOS>
REdiculous
,
madam
?
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
you
mean
rIdiculous
:
 
let
me
have
no
more
of
that
;
'
tis
the
author
of
the
Atalantis
's
spelling
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
mended
it
in
your
letter
.
 
<EOS>
And
can
Stella
read
this
writing
without
hurting
her
dear
eyes
?
<EOS>
O
,
faith
,
I
am
afraid
not
.
 
<EOS>
Have
a
care
of
those
eyes
,
pray
,
pray
,
pretty
Stella

<EOS>
"
Tis
<EOS>
well
enough
what
you
observe
<EOS>
,
that
,
if
I
writ
better
,
perhaps
you
would
not
read
so
well
,
being
used
to
this
manner
;
'
tis
an
alphabet
you
are
used
to
:
 
you
know
such
a
pot
-
hook
makes
a
letter
;
and
you
know
what
letter
,
and
so
and
so
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
swear
he
told
me
so
,
and
that
they
were
long
letters
too
;
but
I
told
him
it
was
a
gasconnade
of
yours
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
talking
of
the
Bishop
of
Clogher
,
how
he
forgot
.
 
<EOS>
Turn
over
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
not
room
on
t'other
side
to
say
that
,
so
I
did
it
on
this
:
 
<EOS>
I
fancy
<EOS>
that
's
a
good
Irish
blunder
.
 
<EOS>
Ah
,
why
do
not
you
go
down
to
Clogher
,
nautinautinautideargirls
;
I
dare
not
say
nauti
without
dear
:
 
<EOS>
O
,
faith
,
you
govern
me
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
seriously
,
I
'm
sorry
you
do
n't
go
,
as
far
as
I
can
judge
at
this
distance
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
we
would
get
you
another
horse
;
I
will
make
Parvisol
get
you
one
.
 
<EOS>
I
always
doubted
that
horse
of
yours
:
 
<EOS>
prythee
sell
him
,
and
let
it
be
a
present
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
My
heart
aches
when
I
think
you
ride
him
.
 
<EOS>
Order
Parvisol
to
sell
him
,
and
that
you
are
to
return
me
the
money
:
 
<EOS>
I
shall
never
be
easy
until
he
is
out
of
your
hands
.
 
<EOS>
Faith
,
I
have
dreamt
five
or
six
times
of
horses
stumbling
since
I
had
your
letter
.
 
<EOS>
If
he
ca
n't
sell
him
,
let
him
run
this
winter
.
 
<EOS>
Faith
,
if
I
was
near
you
,
I
would
whip
your
#
#
#
#
 
to
some
tune
,
for
your
grave
,
saucy
answer
about
the
Dean
and
Johnsonibus
;
I
would
,
young
women
.
 
<EOS>
And
did
the
Dean
preach
for
me
?
 
<EOS>
Very
well
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
would
they
have
me
stand
here
and
preach
to
them
?
 
<EOS>
No
,
the
Tatler
of
the
Shilling
was
not
mine
,
more
than
the
hint
,
and
two
or
three
general
heads
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
much
more
important
business
on
my
hands
;
and
,
besides
,
the
Ministry
hate
to
think
that
I
should
help
him
,
and
have
made
reproaches
on
it
;
and
I
frankly
told
them
I
would
do
it
no
more
.
<EOS>
This
is
a
secret
though
,
Madam
Stella
.
 
<EOS>
You
win
eight
shillings
?
<EOS>
you
win
eight
fiddlesticks
.
 
<EOS>
Faith
,
you
say
nothing
of
what
you
lose
,
young
women
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
Manley
is
in
no
great
danger
;
for
Ned
Southwell
is
his
friend
,
and
so
is
Sir
Thomas
Frankland
;
and
his
brother
John
Manley
stands
up
heartily
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
On
t'other
side
,
all
the
gentlemen
of
Ireland
here
are
furiously
against
him
.
<EOS>
Now
,
Mistress
Dingley
,
an't
you
an
impudent
slut
,
to
expect
a
letter
next
packet
from
Presto
,
when
you
confess
yourself
that
you
had
so
lately
two
letters
in
four
days
?
 
<EOS>
Unreasonable
baggage
!
 
<EOS>
No
,
little
Dingley
,
I
am
always
in
bed
by
twelve
;
I
mean
my
candle
is
out
by
twelve
,
and
I
take
great
care
of
myself
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
let
everybody
know
,
upon
occasion
,
that
Mr.
Harley
got
the
First
-
Fruits
from
the
Queen
for
the
clergy
of
Ireland
,
and
that
nothing
remains
but
the
forms
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
So
you
say
the
Dean
and
you
dined
at
Stoyte
's
,
and
Mrs.
Stoyte
was
in
raptures
that
I
remembered
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
do
it
but
<EOS>
seldom
,
or
it
will
take
off
her
rapture
.
<EOS>
But
what
now
,
you
saucy
sluts
?
<EOS>
all
this
written
in
a
morning
,
and
I
must
rise
and
go
abroad
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
stay
till
night
:
 
<EOS>
do
not
think
I
will
squander
mornings
upon
you
,
pray
,
good
madam
.
<EOS>
Faith
,
if
I
go
on
longer
in
this
trick
of
writing
in
the
morning
,
I
shall
be
afraid
of
leaving
it
off
,
and
think
you
expect
it
,
and
be
in
awe
.
 
<EOS>
Good
-
morrow
,
sirrahs
,
I
will
rise
.
 
<EOS>
At
night
.
 
<EOS>
I
went
to
-
day
to
the
Court
of
Requests
<EOS>
(
I
will
not
answer
the
rest
of
your
letter
yet
,
that
by
the
way
,
in
hopes
to
dine
with
Mr.
Harley
:
 
but
Lord
Dupplin
,
his
son
-
in
-
law
,
told
me
he
did
not
dine
at
home
;
so
I
was
at
a
loss
,
until
I
met
with
Mr.
Secretary
St.
John
,
and
went
home
and
dined
with
him
,
where
he
told
me
of
a
good
bite
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Rivers
told
me
two
days
ago
,
that
he
was
resolved
to
come
Sunday
fortnight
next
to
hear
me
preach
before
the
Queen
.
 
<EOS>
I
assured
him
the
day
was
not
yet
fixed
,
and
I
knew
nothing
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
To
-
day
the
Secretary
told
me
that
his
father
,
Sir
Harry
St.
John
,
and
Lord
Rivers
were
to
be
at
St.
James
's
Church
,
to
hear
me
preach
there
;
and
were
assured
I
was
to
preach
:
 
<EOS>
so
there
will
be
another
bite
;
for
I
know
nothing
of
the
matter
,
but
that
Mr.
Harley
and
St.
John
are
resolved
I
must
preach
before
the
Queen
;
and
the
Secretary
of
State
has
told
me
he
will
give
me
three
weeks
"
warning
;
but
I
desired
to
be
excused
,
which
he
will
not
.
 
<EOS>
St.
John
,
"
You
shall
not
be
excused
"
:
 
however
,
I
hope
they
will
forget
it
;
for
if
it
should
happen
,
all
the
puppies
hereabouts
will
throng
to
hear
me
,
and
expect
something
wonderful
,
and
be
plaguily
baulked
;
for
I
shall
preach
plain
honest
stuff
.
 
<EOS>
I
stayed
with
St.
John
till
eight
,
and
then
came
home
;
and
Patrick
desired
leave
to
go
abroad
,
and
by
and
by
comes
up
the
girl
to
tell
me
,
a
gentleman
was
below
in
a
coach
,
who
had
a
bill
to
pay
me
;
so
I
let
him
come
up
,
and
who
should
it
be
<EOS>
but
Mr.
Addison
and
Sam
Dopping
,
to
haul
me
out
to
supper
,
where
I
stayed
till
twelve
.
 
<EOS>
If
Patrick
had
been
at
home
,
I
should
have
"
scaped
this
;
for
I
have
taught
him
to
deny
me
almost
as
well
as
Mr.
Harley
's
porter
.
 
<EOS>
Where
did
I
leave
off
in
MD
's
letter
?
<EOS>
let
me
see
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
now
I
have
it
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
pleased
to
say
,
Madam
Dingley
,
that
those
who
go
for
England
can
never
tell
when
to
come
back
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
mean
this
as
a
reflection
upon
Presto
,
madam
?
 
<EOS>
Sauceboxes
,
I
will
come
back
as
soon
as
I
can
,
as
hope
saved
,
and
I
hope
with
some
advantage
,
unless
all
Ministries
be
alike
,
as
perhaps
they
may
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
Hawkshaw
is
in
Dublin
before
now
,
and
that
you
have
your
things
,
and
like
your
spectacles
:
 
<EOS>
if
you
do
not
,
you
shall
have
better
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
Dingley
's
tobacco
did
not
spoil
Stella
's
chocolate
,
and
that
all
is
safe
:
 
<EOS>
pray
let
me
know
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Addison
and
I
are
different
as
black
and
white
,
and
I
believe
our
friendship
will
go
off
,
by
this
damned
business
of
party
:
 
<EOS>
he
can
not
bear
seeing
me
fall
in
so
with
this
Ministry
:
 
<EOS>
but
I
love
him
still
as
well
as
ever
,
though
we
seldom
meet
.
 
<EOS>
Hussy
,
Stella
,
you
jest
about
poor
Congreve
's
eyes
<EOS>
;
you
do
so
,
hussy
;
but
I
'll
bang
your
bones
,
faith
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
Steele
was
a
little
while
in
prison
,
or
at
least
in
a
spunging
-
house
,
some
time
before
I
came
,
but
not
since
.
 
<EOS>
P
ox
on
your
convocations
,
and
your
Lamberts
<EOS>
;
they
write
with
a
vengeance
!
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
you
think
it
a
piece
of
affectation
in
me
to
wish
your
Irish
folks
would
not
like
my
"
Shower
,
"
;
but
you
are
mistaken
.
<EOS>
I
should
be
glad
to
have
the
general
applause
there
as
I
have
here
(
though
I
say
it
)
;
but
I
have
only
that
of
one
or
two
,
and
therefore
I
would
have
none
at
all
,
but
let
you
all
be
in
the
wrong
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
,
this
is
not
what
I
would
say
;
but
I
am
so
tosticated
with
supper
and
stuff
,
that
I
ca
n't
express
myself
.
 
<EOS>
What
you
say
of
"
Sid
Hamet
"
is
well
enough
;
that
an
enemy
should
like
it
,
and
a
friend
not
;
and
that
telling
the
author
would
make
both
change
their
opinions
.
 
<EOS>
Why
did
you
not
tell
Griffyth
that
you
fancied
there
was
something
in
it
of
my
manner
;
but
first
spur
up
his
commendation
to
the
height
,
as
we
served
my
poor
uncle
about
the
sconce
that
I
mended
?
 
<EOS>
Well
,
I
desired
you
to
give
what
I
intended
for
an
answer
to
Mrs.
Fenton
,
to
save
her
postage
,
and
myself
trouble
;
and
I
hope
I
have
done
it
,
if
you
han't
.
  
<EOS>
15
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
,
what
a
long
day
's
writing
was
yesterday
's
answer
to
your
letter
,
sirrahs
!
 
<EOS>
I
dined
to
-
day
with
Lewis
and
Ford
,
whom
I
have
brought
acquainted
.
<EOS>
Lewis
told
me
a
pure
thing
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
been
hankering
with
Mr.
Harley
to
save
Steele
his
other
employment
,
and
have
a
little
mercy
on
him
;
and
I
had
been
saying
the
same
thing
to
Lewis
,
who
is
Mr.
Harley
's
chief
favourite
.
 
<EOS>
Lewis
tells
Mr.
Harley
how
kindly
I
should
take
it
,
if
he
would
be
reconciled
to
Steele
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Harley
,
on
my
account
,
falls
in
with
it
,
and
appoints
Steele
a
time
to
let
him
attend
him
,
which
Steele
accepts
with
great
submission
,
but
never
comes
,
nor
sends
any
excuse
.
 
<EOS>
Whether
it
was
blundering
,
sullenness
,
insolence
,
or
rancour
of
party
,
I
can
not
tell
;
but
I
shall
trouble
myself
no
more
about
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
Addison
hindered
him
out
of
mere
spite
,
being
grated
to
the
soul
to
think
he
should
ever
want
my
help
to
save
his
friend
;
yet
now
he
is
soliciting
me
to
make
another
of
his
friends
Queen
's
Secretary
at
Geneva
;
and
I
'll
do
it
if
I
can
;
it
is
poor
Pastoral
Philips
.
  
<EOS>
16
.
 
<EOS>
O
,
why
did
you
leave
my
picture
behind
you
at
t'other
lodgings
?
 
<EOS>
Forgot
it
?
 
<EOS>
Well
;
but
pray
remember
it
now
,
and
do
n't
roll
it
up
,
d'ye
hear
;
but
hang
it
carefully
in
some
part
of
your
room
,
where
chairs
and
candles
and
mop
-
sticks
wo
n't
spoil
it
,
sirrahs
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
truly
,
I
will
not
be
godfather
to
Goody
Walls
this
bout
,
and
I
hope
she
will
have
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
There
will
be
no
quiet
nor
cards
for
this
child
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
it
will
die
the
day
after
the
christening
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Harley
gave
me
a
paper
,
with
an
account
of
the
sentence
you
speak
of
against
the
lads
that
defaced
the
statue
,
and
that
Ingoldsby
reprieved
that
part
of
it
of
standing
before
the
statue
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
it
was
never
executed
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
got
your
Broderick
out
;
Doyne
is
to
succeed
him
,
and
Cox
Doyne
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
there
's
an
end
of
your
letter
;
'
tis
all
answered
;
and
now
I
must
go
on
upon
my
own
stock
.
 
<EOS>
Go
on
,
did
I
say
?
 
<EOS>
Why
,
I
have
written
enough
;
but
this
is
too
soon
to
send
it
yet
,
young
women
;
faith
,
I
dare
not
use
you
to
it
<EOS>
,
you
'll
always
expect
it
;
what
remains
shall
be
only
short
journals
of
a
day
,
and
so
I
'll
rise
for
this
morning
.
 
<EOS>
At
night
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
with
my
opposite
neighbour
,
Darteneuf
;
and
I
was
soliciting
this
day
to
present
the
Bishop
of
Clogher
Vice
-
Chancellor
;
but
it
wo
n't
do
;
they
are
all
set
against
him
,
and
the
Duke
of
Ormond
,
they
say
,
has
resolved
to
dispose
of
it
somewhere
else
.
 
<EOS>
Well
;
little
saucy
rogues
,
do
not
stay
out
too
late
to
-
night
,
because
it
is
Saturday
night
,
and
young
women
should
come
home
soon
then
.
  
<EOS>
17
.
 
<EOS>
I
went
to
Court
to
seek
a
dinner
:
 
but
the
Queen
was
not
at
church
,
she
has
got
a
touch
of
the
gout
;
so
the
Court
was
thin
,
and
I
went
to
the
Coffee
-
house
;
and
Sir
Thomas
Frankland
and
his
eldest
son
<EOS>
and
I
went
and
dined
with
his
son
William
.
 
<EOS>
I
talked
a
great
deal
to
Sir
Thomas
about
Manley
;
and
find
he
is
his
good
friend
,
and
so
has
Ned
Southwell
been
,
and
I
hope
he
will
be
safe
,
though
all
the
Irish
folks
here
are
his
mortal
enemies
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
devilish
bite
to
-
day
.
 
<EOS>
They
had
it
<EOS>
,
I
know
not
how
,
that
I
was
to
preach
this
morning
at
St.
James
's
Church
;
an
abundance
went
,
among
the
rest
Lord
Radnor
,
who
never
is
abroad
till
three
in
the
afternoon
.
 
<EOS>
I
walked
all
the
way
home
from
Hatton
Garden
at
six
,
by
moonlight
,
a
delicate
night
.
 
<EOS>
Raymond
called
at
nine
,
but
I
was
denied
;
and
now
I
am
in
bed
between
eleven
and
twelve
,
just
going
to
sleep
,
and
dream
of
my
own
dear
roguish
impudent
pretty
MD
.
  
<EOS>
18
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
now
have
short
days
'
works
,
just
a
few
lines
to
tell
you
where
I
am
,
and
what
I
am
doing
;
only
I
will
keep
room
for
the
last
day
to
tell
you
news
,
if
there
be
any
worth
sending
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
sometimes
like
to
do
it
at
the
top
of
my
letter
,
until
I
remark
it
would
be
old
before
it
reached
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
hunting
to
dine
with
Mr.
Harley
to
-
day
,
but
could
not
find
him
;
and
so
I
dined
with
honest
Dr.
Cockburn
,
and
came
home
at
six
,
and
was
taken
out
to
next
door
by
Dopping
and
Ford
,
to
drink
bad
claret
and
oranges
;
and
we
let
Raymond
come
to
us
,
who
talks
of
leaving
the
town
to
-
morrow
,
but
I
believe
will
stay
a
day
or
two
longer
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
now
late
,
and
I
will
say
no
more
,
but
end
this
line
with
bidding
my
own
dear
saucy
MD
goodnight
,
etc
.

<EOS>
I
am
come
down
proud
stomach
in
one
instance
,
for
I
went
to
-
day
to
see
the
Duke
of
Buckingham
,
but
came
too
late
:
 
<EOS>
then
I
visited
Mrs.
Barton
,
and
thought
to
have
dined
with
some
of
the
Ministry
;
but
it
rained
,
and
Mrs.
Vanhomrigh
was
nigh
,
and
I
took
the
opportunity
of
paying
her
for
a
scarf
she
bought
me
,
and
dined
there
;
at
four
I
went
to
congratulate
with
Lord
Shelburne
,
for
the
death
of
poor
Lady
Shelburne
dowager
;
he
was
at
his
country
house
,
and
returned
while
I
was
there
,
and
had
not
heard
of
it
,
and
he
took
it
very
well
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
now
come
home
before
six
,
and
find
a
packet
from
the
Bishop
of
Clogher
,
with
one
enclosed
to
the
Duke
of
Ormond
,
which
is
ten
days
earlier
dated
than
another
I
had
from
Parvisol
;
however
,
'
tis
<EOS>
no
matter
,
for
the
Duke
has
already
disposed
of
the
Vice
-
Chancellorship
to
the
Archbishop
of
Tuam
,
and
I
could
not
help
it
,
for
it
is
a
thing
wholly
you
know
in
the
Duke
's
power
;
and
I
find
the
Bishop
has
enemies
about
the
Duke
.
 
<EOS>
I
write
this
while
Patrick
is
folding
up
my
scarf
,
and
doing
up
the
fire
(
for
I
keep
a
fire
<EOS>
,
it
costs
me
twelvepence
a
week
)
;
and
so
be
quiet
till
I
am
gone
to
bed
,
and
then
sit
down
by
me
a
little
,
and
we
will
talk
a
few
words
more
.
<EOS>
Well
;
now
MD
is
at
my
bedside
;
and
now
what
shall
we
say
?
 
<EOS>
How
does
Mrs.
Stoyte
?
 
<EOS>
What
had
the
Dean
for
supper
?
 
<EOS>
How
much
did
Mrs.
Walls
win
?
 
<EOS>
Poor
Lady
Shelburne
:
 
<EOS>
well
,
go
get
you
to
bed
,
sirrahs
.
  
<EOS>

<EOS>
Morning
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
up
this
morning
early
,
and
shaved
by
candlelight
,
and
write
this
by
the
fireside
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
Raymond
just
came
in
and
took
his
leave
of
me
;
he
is
summoned
by
high
order
from
his
wife
,
but
pretends
he
has
had
enough
of
London
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
a
little
melancholy
to
part
with
him
;
he
goes
to
Bristol
,
where
they
are
to
be
with
his
merchant
brother
,
and
now
thinks
of
staying
till
May
;
so
she
must
be
brought
to
bed
in
England
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
so
easy
and
manageable
,
<EOS>
that
I
almost
repent
I
suffered
him
to
see
me
so
seldom
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
is
gone
,
and
will
save
Patrick
some
lies
in
a
week
:
 
<EOS>
Patrick
is
grown
admirable
at
it
,
and
will
make
his
fortune
.
 
<EOS>
How
now
,
sirrah
,
must
I
write
in
a
morning
to
your
impudence
?
       
<EOS>
Stay
till
night
,
     
<EOS>
And
then
I
'll
write
,
     
<EOS>
In
black
and
white
,
     
<EOS>
By
candlelight
,
     
Of
wax
<EOS>
so
bright
,
     
It
helps
the
sight
      
<EOS>
A
bite

<EOS>
Marry
come
up
,
Mistress
Boldface
.
 
<EOS>
At
night
.
 
<EOS>
Dr.
Raymond
came
back
,
and
goes
to
-
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
I
did
not
come
home
till
eleven
,
and
found
him
here
to
take
leave
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
went
to
the
Court
of
Requests
,
thinking
to
find
Mr.
Harley
and
dine
with
him
,
and
refused
Henley
,
and
everybody
,
and
at
last
knew
not
where
to
go
,
and
met
Jemmy
Leigh
by
chance
,
and
he
was
just
in
the
same
way
,
<EOS>
so
I
dined
at
his
lodgings
on
a
beef
-
steak
,
and
drank
your
health
;
then
left
him
and
went
to
the
tavern
with
Ben
Tooke
and
Portlack
,
the
Duke
of
Ormond
's
secretary
,
drinking
nasty
white
wine
till
eleven
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
sick
,
and
ashamed
of
it
,
etc
.
  
<EOS>
21
.
 
<EOS>
I
met
that
beast
Ferris
,
Lord
Berkeley
's
steward
formerly
;
I
walked
with
him
a
turn
in
the
Park
,
and
that
scoundrel
dog
is
as
happy
as
an
emperor
,
<EOS>
has
married
a
wife
with
a
considerable
estate
in
land
and
houses
about
this
town
,
and
lives
at
his
ease
at
Hammersmith
.
 
<EOS>
See
your
confounded
sect
!
<EOS>
Well
;
I
had
the
same
luck
to
-
day
with
Mr.
Harley
;
'
twas
a
lovely
day
,
and
went
by
water
into
the
City
,
and
dined
with
Stratford
at
a
merchant
's
house
,
and
walked
home
with
as
great
a
dunce
as
Ferris
,
I
mean
honest
Colonel
Caulfeild
,
and
came
home
by
eight
,
and
now
am
in
bed
,
and
going
to
sleep
for
a
wager
,
and
will
send
this
letter
on
Saturday
,
and
so
;
but
first
I
will
wish
you
a
merry
Christmas
and
a
happy
New
Year
,
and
pray
God
we
may
never
keep
them
asunder
again
.
  
<EOS>

<EOS>
Morning
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
going
now
to
Mr.
Harley
's
levee
on
purpose
to
vex
him
;
I
will
say
I
had
no
other
way
of
seeing
him
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
Patrick
says
it
is
a
dark
morning
,
and
that
the
Duke
of
Argyle
is
to
be
knighted
to
-
day
;
the
booby
means
installed
at
Windsor
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
must
rise
,
for
this
is
a
shaving
-
day
,
and
Patrick
says
there
is
a
good
fire
;
I
wish
MD
were
by
it
,
or
I
by
MD
's
.
 
<EOS>
At
night
.
 
<EOS>
I
forgot
to
tell
you
,
Madam
Dingley
,
that
I
paid
nine
shillings
for
your
glass
and
spectacles
,
of
which
three
were
for
the
Bishop
's
case
:
 
<EOS>
I
am
sorry
I
did
not
buy
you
such
another
case
;
but
if
you
like
it
,
I
will
bring
one
over
with
me
;
pray
tell
me
:
 
the
glass
to
read
was
four
shillings
,
the
spectacles
two
.
 
<EOS>
And
have
you
had
your
chocolate
?
 
<EOS>
Leigh
says
he
sent
the
petticoat
by
one
Mr.
Spencer
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
have
you
no
further
commissions
for
me
?
 
<EOS>
I
paid
the
glass
-
man
but
last
night
,
and
he
would
have
made
me
a
present
of
the
microscope
worth
thirty
shillings
,
and
would
have
sent
it
home
along
with
me
<EOS>
;
I
thought
the
deuce
was
in
the
man
:
 
<EOS>
he
said
I
could
do
him
more
service
than
that
was
worth
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
I
refused
his
present
,
but
promised
him
all
service
I
could
do
him
;
and
so
now
I
am
obliged
in
honour
to
recommend
him
to
everybody
.
 
<EOS>
At
night
.
 
<EOS>
I
went
to
Mr.
Harley
's
levee
;
he
came
and
asked
me
what
I
had
to
do
there
,
and
bid
me
come
and
dine
with
him
on
a
family
dinner
;
which
I
did
,
and
it
was
the
first
time
I
ever
saw
his
lady
and
daughter
;
at
five
my
Lord
Keeper
came
in
:
 
<EOS>
I
told
Mr.
Harley
,
he
had
formerly
presented
me
to
Sir
Simon
Harcourt
,
but
now
must
to
my
Lord
Keeper
;
so
he
laughed
,
etc
.
  
<EOS>

<EOS>
Morning
.
 
<EOS>
This
letter
goes
to
-
night
without
fail
;
I
hope
there
is
none
from
you
yet
at
the
Coffee

house
;
I
will
send
and
see
by

and
let
you
know

so

<EOS>
Patrick
goes
to
see
for
a
letter
:
 
<EOS>
what
will
you
lay
,
is
there
one
from
MD
or
no
?
 
<EOS>
No
,
I
say
;
done
for
sixpence
.
 
<EOS>
Why
has
the
Dean
never
once
written
to
me
?
 
<EOS>
I
won
sixpence
;
I
won
sixpence
;
there
is
not

<EOS>
Good

Stratford

I
dine
to

with
Lord
Mountjoy

<EOS>
God
Almighty

<EOS>
I
have
been
dining
at
Lord
Mountjoy
's

and
am
come
to
study

our
news
from
Spain
this
post
takes
off
some
of
our
fears

The
Parliament

prorogued

adjourned
rather
till
after

<EOS>
Bank
Stock

Patrick

Good

both

be

remember
your

you
sadly

Let
me
go
study

naughty

and
do
n't
keep
me
at
the
bottom
of
the
paper

<EOS>
O
,
faith
,
if
you
knew
what
lies
on
my
hands
constantly
,
you
would
wonder
to
see
how
I
could
write
such
long
letters
;
but
we
'll
talk
of
that
some
other
time

<EOS>
Good

God
bless

His

<EOS>
Ask
the
Bishop
of
Clogher
about
the
pun
I
sent
him
of
Lord
Stawel
's
brother
;
it
will
be
a
pure
bite

<EOS>
This
letter
has
199
lines
in
it
,
beside
all
postscripts
;
I
had
a
curiosity
to
reckon
.
  
<EOS>
There
is
a
long
letter
for
you
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
longer
than
a
sermon
,
faith
.
  
<EOS>
I
had
another
letter
from
Mrs.
Fenton

who
says
you
were
with

I
hope
you
did
not
go
on
purpose

<EOS>
I
will
answer
her
letter
soon

it
is
about
some
money
in
Lady
Giffard
's
hands

<EOS>
They
say
you
have
had
eight
packets
due

do
not

LETTER
12
.
 
<EOS>
LONDON
,
Dec.
23
,
1710
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
sent
my
11th
to
-
night
as
usual
,
and
begin
the
dozenth
,
and
I
told
you
I
dined
with
Stratford
at
Lord
Mountjoy
's
,
and
I
will
tell
you
no
more
at
present
,
guess
for
why
;
because
I
am
going
to
mind
things
,
and
mighty
affairs
,
not
your
nasty
First
-
Fruits
 
I
let
them
alone
till
Mr.
Harley
gets
the
Queen
's
letter
 
but
other
things
of
greater
moment
,
<EOS>
that
you
shall
know
one
day
,
when
the
ducks
have
eaten
up
all
the
dirt
.
 
<EOS>
So
sit
still
a
while
just
by
me
,
while
I
am
studying
,
and
do
n't
say
a
word
,
I
charge
you
,
and
when
I
am
going
to
bed
,
I
will
take
you
along
,
and
talk
with
you
a
little
while
,
so
there
,
sit
there
.
 
<EOS>
Come
then
,
let
us
see
what
we
have
to
say
to
these
saucy
brats
,
that
will
not
let
us
go
sleep
at
past
eleven
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
I
am
a
little
impatient
to
know
how
you
do
;
but
that
I
take
it
for
a
standing
maxim
,
that
when
you
are
silent
,
all
is
pretty
well
,
because
that
is
the
way
I
will
deal
with
you
;
and
if
there
was
anything
you
ought
to
know
now
,
I
would
write
by
the
first
post
,
although
I
had
written
but
<EOS>
the
day
before
.
 
<EOS>
Remember
this
,
young
women
;
and
God
Almighty
preserve
you
both
,
and
make
us
happy
together
;
and
tell
me
how
accompts
stand
between
us
,
that
you
may
be
paid
long
before
it
is
due
,
not
to
want
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
return
no
more
money
while
I
stay
,
so
that
you
need
not
be
in
pain
to
be
paid
;
but
let
me
know
at
least
a
month
before
you
can
want
.
 
<EOS>
Observe
this
,
d'ye
hear
,
little
dear
sirrahs
,
and
love
Presto
,
as
Presto
loves
MD
,
etc

You
will
have
a
merrier
Christmas
Eve
than
we
here
.
 
<EOS>
I
went
up
to
Court
before
church
;
and
in
one
of
the
rooms
,
there
being
but
little
company
,
<EOS>
a
fellow
in
a
red
coat
without
a
sword
came
up
to
me
,
and
,
after
words
of
course
,
asked
me
how
the
ladies
did
?
 
<EOS>
I
asked
,
"
<EOS>
What
ladies
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
He
said
,
"
Mrs.
Dingley
and
Mrs.
Johnson
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Very
well
,
"
said
I
,
"
when
I
heard
from
them
last
:
and
pray
when
came
you
from
thence
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
He
said
,
"
I
never
was
in
Ireland
"
;
and
just
at
that
word
Lord
Winchelsea
comes
up
to
me
,
and
the
man
went
off
:
as
I
went
out
<EOS>
I
saw
him
again
,
and
recollected
him
,
it
was
Vedeau
with
a
pox
:
 
<EOS>
I
then
went
and
made
my
apologies
,
that
my
head
was
full
of
something
I
had
to
say
to
Lord
Winchelsea
,
etc
.
,
and
I
asked
after
his
wife
,
and
so
all
was
well
;
and
he
inquired
after
my
lodging
,
because
he
had
some
favour
to
desire
of
me
in
Ireland
,
to
recommend
somebody
to
somebody
<EOS>
,
I
know
not
what
it
is
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
came
from
church
,
I
went
up
to
Court
again
,
where
Sir
Edmond
Bacon
told
me
the
bad
news
from
Spain
,
which
you
will
hear
before
this
reaches
you
;
as
we
have
it
now
,
we
are
undone
there
,
and
it
was
odd
to
see
the
whole
countenances
of
the
Court
changed
so
in
two
hours
.
 
<EOS>
Lady
Mountjoy
carried
me
home
to
dinner
,
where
I
stayed
not
long
after
,
and
came
home
early
,
and
now
am
got
into
bed
,
for
you
must
always
write
to
your
MD
's
in
bed
,
that
is
a
maxim
.
       
<EOS>
Mr.
White
and
Mr.
Red
,
     
Write
to
MD
when
abed
;
     
Mr.
Black
and
Mr.
Brown
,
     
Write
to
MD
when
you
're
down
;
     
Mr.
Oak
and
Mr.
Willow
,
     
Write
to
MD
on
your
pillow

<EOS>
What
is
this
?
<EOS>
faith
,
I
smell
fire
;
what
can
it
be
?
<EOS>
this
house
has
a
thousand
stinks
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
to
leave
it
on
Thursday
,
and
lodge
over
the
way
.
<EOS>
Faith
,
I
must
rise
,
and
look
at
my
chimney
,
for
the
smell
grows
stronger
,
stay
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
up
,
and
in
my
room
,
and
found
all
safe
,
only
a
mouse
within
the
fender
to
warm
himself
,
which
I
could
not
catch
.
 
<EOS>
I
smelt
nothing
there
,
but
now
in
my
bed
-
chamber
I
smell
it
again
;
I
believe
I
have
singed
the
woollen
curtain
,
and
that
is
all
,
though
I
can
not
smoke
it
.
 
<EOS>
Presto
is
plaguy
silly
to
-
night
,
<EOS>
an't
he
?
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
and
so
he
be
.
 
<EOS>
Ay
,
but
if
I
should
wake
and
see
fire
.
 
<EOS>
Well
;
I
will
venture
;
so
good
-
night
,
etc
.
  
<EOS>

.
 
<EOS>
Pray
,
young
women
,
if
I
write
so
much
as
this
every
day
,
how
will
this
paper
hold
a
fortnight
's
work
,
and
answer
one
of
yours
into
the
bargain
?
 
<EOS>
You
never
think
of
this
,
but
let
me
go
on
like
a
simpleton
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
you
a
merry
Christmas
,
and
many
,
many
a
one
with
poor
Presto
at
some
pretty
place
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
at
church
to
-
day
by
eight
,
and
received
the
Sacrament
,
and
came
home
by
ten
;
then
went
to
Court
at
two
:
 
<EOS>
it
was
a
Collar
-
day
,
that
is
,
when
the
Knights
of
the
Garter
wear
their
collars
;
but
the
Queen
stayed
so
late
at
Sacrament
,
that
I
came
back
,
and
dined
with
my
neighbour
Ford
,
because
all
people
dine
at
home
on
this
day
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
likewise
a
Collar
-
day
all
over
England
in
every
house
,
at
least
where
there
is
BRAWN
:
 
<EOS>
that
's
very
well
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
you
a
good
pun
;
a
fellow
hard
by
pretends
to
cure
agues
,
and
has
set
out
a
sign
,
and
spells
it
EGOES
;
a
gentleman
and
I
observing
it
,
he
said
,
"
How
does
that
fellow
pretend
to
cure
AGUES
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
said
I
did
not
know
;
but
I
was
sure
it
was
not
by
a
SPELL
.
<EOS>
That
is
admirable
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
you
asked
the
Bishop
about
that
pun
of
Lord
Stawel
's
brother
.
 
<EOS>
Bite
!
 
<EOS>
Have
I
caught
you
,
young
women
?
 
<EOS>
Must
you
pretend
to
ask
after
roguish
puns
,
and
Latin
ones
too
?
 
<EOS>
Oh
<EOS>
but
you
smoked
me
,
and
did
not
ask
the
Bishop
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
<EOS>
but
you
are
a
fool
,
and
you
did
.
 
<EOS>
I
met
Vedeau
again
at
Court
to
-
day
,
and
I
observed
he
had
a
sword
on
;
I
fancy
<EOS>
he
was
broke
,
and
has
got
a
commission
,
but
I
never
asked
him
.
 
<EOS>
Vedeau
<EOS>
I
think
his
name
is
,
yet
Parvisol
's
man
is
Vedel
,
that
is
true
.
 
<EOS>
Bank
Stock
will
fall
like
stock
-
fish
by
this
bad
news
,
and
two
days
ago
I
could
have
got
twelve
pounds
by
my
bargain
;
but
I
do
not
intend
to
sell
,
and
in
time
it
will
rise
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
odd
that
my
Lord
Peterborow
foretold
this
loss
two
months
ago
,
one
night
at
Mr.
Harley
's
,
when
I
was
there
;
he
bid
us
count
upon
it
,
that
Stanhope
would
lose
Spain
before
Christmas
;
that
he
would
venture
his
head
upon
it
,
and
gave
us
reasons
;
and
though
Mr.
Harley
argued
the
contrary
,
he
still
held
to
his
opinion
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
telling
my
Lord
Angelsea
this
at
Court
this
morning
;
and
a
gentleman
by
said
he
had
heard
my
Lord
Peterborow
affirm
the
same
thing
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
heard
wise
folks
say
,
"
An
ill
tongue
may
do
much
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
'
tis
an
odd
saying
,
       
"
<EOS>
Once
I
guessed
right
,
      
<EOS>
And
I
got
credit
by't
;
      
<EOS>
Thrice
<EOS>
I
guessed
wrong
,
      
<EOS>
And
I
kept
my
credit
on
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
No
,
it
is
you
are
sorry
,
not
I.

<EOS>
By
the
Lord
Harry
,
I
shall
be
undone
here
with
Christmas
boxes
.
 
<EOS>
The
rogues
of
the
Coffee
-
house
have
raised
their
tax
,
everyone
giving
a
crown
;
and
I
gave
mine
for
shame
,
besides
a
great
many
half
-
crowns
to
great
men
's
porters
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
I
went
to
-
day
by
water
into
the
city
,
and
dined
with
no
less
a
man
than
the
City
Printer
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
an
intimacy
between
us
,
built
upon
reasons
that
you
shall
know
when
I
see
you
;
but
the
rain
caught
me
within
twelvepenny
length
of
home
.
 
<EOS>
I
called
at
Mr.
Harley
's
,
who
was
not
within
,
dropped
my
half
-
crown
with
his
porter
,
drove
to
the
Coffee
-
house
,
where
the
rain
kept
me
till
nine
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
letters
to
-
day
from
the
Archbishop
of
Dublin
and
Mr.
Bernage
;
the
latter
sends
me
a
melancholy
account
of
Lady
Shelburne
's
death
,
and
his
own
disappointments
,
and
would
gladly
be
a
captain
;
if
I
can
help
him
,
I
will
.
  
<EOS>
27
.
 
<EOS>
Morning
.
 
<EOS>
I
bespoke
a
lodging
over
the
way
for
tomorrow
,
and
the
dog
let
it
yesterday
to
another
;
I
gave
him
no
earnest
,
so
<EOS>
it
seems
he
could
do
it
;
Patrick
would
have
had
me
give
him
earnest
to
bind
him
;
but
I
would
not
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
must
go
saunter
to
-
day
for
a
lodging
somewhere
else
.
 
<EOS>
Did
you
ever
see
so
open
a
winter
in
England
?
 
<EOS>
We
have
not
had
two
frosty
days
;
but
it
pays
it
off
in
rain
:
 
<EOS>
we
have
not
had
three
fair
days
these
six
weeks
.
 
<EOS>
O
,
faith
<EOS>
,
I
dreamt
mightily
of
MD
last
night
;
but
so
confused
,
I
can
not
tell
a
word
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
made
Ford
acquainted
with
Lewis
;
and
to
-
day
we
dined
together
:
 
<EOS>
in
the
evening
I
called
at
one
or
two
neighbours
,
hoping
to
spend
a
Christmas
evening
;
but
none
were
at
home
,
they
were
all
gone
to
be
merry
with
others
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
often
observed
this
,
that
in
merry
times
everybody
is
abroad
;
where
the
deuce
are
they
?
 
<EOS>
So
I
went
to
the
Coffee
-
house
,
and
talked
with
Mr.
Addison
an
hour
,
who
at
last
remembered
to
give
me
two
letters
,
which
I
can
not
answer
to
-
night
,
nor
to
-
morrow
<EOS>
neither
<EOS>
,
I
can
assure
you
,
young
women
,
count
upon
that
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
other
things
to
do
than
to
answer
naughty
girls
,
an
old
saying
and
true
,
       
<EOS>
Letters
from
MD
's
     
Must
not
be
answered
in
ten
days
:
  
<EOS>
it
is
but
bad
rhyme
,
etc
.
  
<EOS>
28
.
 
<EOS>
To
-
day
I
had
a
message
from
Sir
Thomas
Hanmer
,
to
dine
with
him
;
the
famous
Dr.
Smalridge
was
of
the
company
,
and
we
sat
till
six
;
and
I
came
home
to
my
new
lodgings
in
St.
Albans
Street
,
where
I
pay
the
same
rent
(
eight
shillings
a
week
)
for
an
apartment
two
pair
of
stairs
;
but
I
have
the
use
of
the
parlour
to
receive
persons
of
quality
,
and
I
am
got
into
my
new
bed
,
etc
.
  
<EOS>
29
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
Andrew
Fountaine
has
been
very
ill
this
week
;
and
sent
to
me
early
this
morning
to
have
prayers
,
which
you
know
is
the
last
thing
.
 
<EOS>
I
found
the
doctors
and
all
in
despair
about
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
read
prayers
to
him
,
found
he
had
settled
all
things
;
<EOS>
and
,
when
I
came
out
,
the
nurse
asked
me
whether
I
thought
it
possible
he
could
live
;
for
the
doctors
thought
not
.
 
<EOS>
I
said
,
I
believed
he
would
live
;
for
I
found
the
seeds
of
life
in
him
,
which
I
observe
seldom
fail
<EOS>
(
and
I
found
them
in
poor
,
dearest
Stella
,
when
she
was
ill
many
years
ago
)
;
and
to
-
night
I
was
with
him
again
,
and
he
was
mightily
recovered
,
and
I
hope
he
will
do
well
,
and
the
doctor
approved
my
reasons
;
but
,
if
he
should
die
,
I
should
come
off
scurvily
.
 
<EOS>
The
Secretary
of
State
(
Mr.
St.
John
)
sent
to
me
to
dine
with
him
;
Mr.
Harley
and
Lord
Peterborow
dined
there
too
;
and
at
night
came
Lord
Rivers
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Peterborow
goes
to
Vienna
in
a
day
or
two
:
 
<EOS>
he
has
promised
to
make
me
write
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Harley
went
away
at
six
;
but
we
stayed
till
seven
.
 
<EOS>
I
took
the
Secretary
aside
,
and
complained
to
him
of
Mr.
Harley
,
that
he
had
got
the
Queen
to
grant
the
First
-
Fruits
,
promised
to
bring
me
to
her
,
and
get
her
letter
to
the
bishops
of
Ireland
;
but
<EOS>
the
last
part
he
had
not
done
in
six
weeks
,
and
I
was
in
danger
to
lose
reputation
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
He
took
the
matter
right
,
desired
me
to
be
with
him
on
Sunday
morning
,
and
promises
me
to
finish
the
affair
in
four
days
;
so
I
shall
know
in
a
little
time
what
I
have
to
trust
to
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
nine
o'clock
,
and
I
must
go
study
,
you
little
rogues
;
and
so
good
-
night
,
etc
.
  
<EOS>
30
.
 
<EOS>
Morning

<EOS>
The
weather
grows
cold
,
you
sauceboxes
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
Andrew
Fountaine
,
they
bring
me
word
,
is
better
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
go
rise
,
for
my
hands
are
starving
while
I
write
in
bed
.
 
<EOS>
Night
.
 
<EOS>
Now
Sir
Andrew
Fountaine
is
recovering
,
he
desires
to
be
at
ease
;
for
I
called
in
the
morning
to
read
prayers
,
but
he
had
given
orders
not
to
be
disturbed
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
lost
a
legacy
by
his
living
;
for
he
told
me
he
had
left
me
a
picture
and
some
books
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
I
called
to
see
my
quondam
neighbour
Ford
<EOS>
(
do
you
know
what
quondam
is
,
though
?
)
,
and
he
engaged
me
to
dine
with
him
;
for
he
always
dines
at
home
on
Opera
-
days
.
 
<EOS>
I
came
home
at
six
,
writ
to
the
Archbishop
,
then
studied
till
past
eleven
,
and
stole
to
bed
,
to
write
to
MD
these
few
lines
,
to
let
you
know
I
am
in
good
health
at
the
present
writing
hereof
,
and
hope
in
God
MD
is
so
too
.
 
<EOS>
I
wonder
I
never
write
politics
to
you
:
 
<EOS>
I
could
make
you
the
profoundest
politician
in
all
the
lane
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
but
when
shall
we
answer
this
letter
,
No
.
8
of
MD
's
?
 
<EOS>
Not
till
next
year
,
faith
.
 
<EOS>
O
Lord
 
bo
 
<EOS>
but
that
will
be
a
Monday
next
.
 
<EOS>
Cod's
-
<EOS>
so
,
is
it
?
<EOS>
and
so
it
is
:
 
never
saw
the
like
.
 
<EOS>
I
made
a
pun
t'other
day
to
Ben
Portlack
about
a
pair
of
drawers
.
 
<EOS>
Poh
,
said
he
,
that
's

<EOS>
Pray
,
pray

Dingley

let
me
go
sleep
;
pray

pray
,
Stella

let
me
go
slumber

put
out
my

<EOS>
31
.
 
<EOS>
Morning
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
now
seven
,
and
I
have
got
a
fire
,
but
am
writing
abed
in
my
bed

chamber
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
not
shaving

day

so
I
shall
be
ready
early
to
go
before
church
to
Mr.
St.
John
;
and
to
-
morrow
I
will
answer
our
MD
's
letter
.
       
<EOS>
Would
you
answer
MD
's
letter
,
     
<EOS>
On
New
Year
's
Day
you
'll
do
it
better
;
     
<EOS>
For
,
when
the
year
with
MD
'
gins
,
     
It
without
MD
never
lins
.
  
<EOS>
(
These
proverbs
have
always
old
words
in
them
;
lins
is
leave
off
.
)
       
<EOS>
But
,
if
on
New
Year
you
write
nones
,
     
MD
then
will
bang
your
bones
.
  
<EOS>
But
Patrick
says
I
must
rise
.
 
<EOS>
Night
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
early
this
morning
with
Secretary
St.
John
,
and
gave
him
a
memorial
to
get
the
Queen
's
letter
for
the
First
-
Fruits
,
who
has
promised
to
do
it
in
a
very
few
days
.
 
<EOS>
He
told
me
he
had
been
with
the
Duke
of
Marlborough
,
who
was
lamenting
his
former
wrong
steps
in
joining
with
the
Whigs
,
and
said
he
was
worn
out
with
age
,
fatigues
,
and
misfortunes
.
 
<EOS>
I
swear
it
pitied
me
;
and
I
really
think
they
will
not
do
well
in
too
much
mortifying
that
man
,
although
indeed
it
is
his
own
fault
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
covetous
as
hell
,
and
ambitious
as
the
Prince
of
it
:
 
he
would
fain
have
been
General
for
life
,
and
has
broken
all
endeavours
for
peace
,
to
keep
his
greatness
and
get
money
.
 
<EOS>
He
told
the
Queen
he
was
neither
covetous
nor
ambitious
.
 
<EOS>
She
said
if
she
could
have
conveniently
turned
about
,
she
would
have
laughed
,
and
could
hardly
forbear
it
in
his
face
.
 
<EOS>
He
fell
in
with
all
the
abominable
measures
of
the
late
Ministry
,
because
they
gratified
him
for
their
own
designs
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
he
has
been
a
successful
General
,
and
I
hope
he
will
continue
his
command
.
 
<EOS>
O
Lord
,
smoke
the
politics
to
MD
!
 
<EOS>
Well
;
but
,
if
you
like
them
,
I
will
scatter
a
little
now
and
then
,
and
mine
are
all
fresh
from
the
chief
hands
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
I
dined
with
Mr.
Harley
,
and
came
away
at
six
:
 
<EOS>
there
was
much
company
,
and
I
was
not
merry
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Harley
made
me
read
a
paper
of
verses
of
Prior
's
.
 
<EOS>
I
read
them
plain
,
without
any
fine
manner
;
and
Prior
swore
,
I
should
never
read
any
of
his
again
;
but
he
would
be
revenged
,
and
read
some
of
mine
as
bad
.
 
<EOS>
I
excused
myself
,
and
said
I
was
famous
for
reading
verses
the
worst
in
the
world
;
and
that
everybody
snatched
them
from
me
when
I
offered
to
begin
.
 
<EOS>
So
we
laughed
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
Andrew
Fountaine
still
continues
ill
.
<EOS>
He
is
plagued
with
some
sort
of
bile
.
  
<EOS>
Jan.

<EOS>
Morning
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
my
dearest
,
pretty
Dingley
and
Stella
a
happy
New
Year
,
and
health
,
and
mirth
,
and
good
stomachs
,
and
Fr
's
company
.
 
<EOS>
Faith
,
I
did
not
know
how
to
write
Fr
.
 
<EOS>
I
wondered
what
was
the
matter
;
but
now
I
remember
I
always
write
Pdfr
.
 
<EOS>
Patrick
wishes
me
a
happy
New
Year
,
and
desires
I
would
rise
,
for
it
is
a
good
fire
,
and
faith
'
tis
cold
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
so
politic
last
night
with
MD
,
never
saw
the
like
.
 
<EOS>
Get
the
Examiners
,
and
read
them
;
the
last
nine
or
ten
are
full
of
the
reasons
for
the
late
change
,
and
of
the
abuses
of
the
last
Ministry
;
and
the
great
men
assure
me
they
are
all
true
.
<EOS>
They
are
written
by
their
encouragement
and
direction
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
rise
and
go
see
Sir
Andrew
Fountaine
;
but
perhaps
to
-
night
I
may
answer
MD
's
letter
:
 
<EOS>
so
good
-
morrow
,
my
mistresses
all
,
good
-
morrow
.
       
<EOS>
I
wish
you
<EOS>
both
a
merry
New
Year
,
     
Roast
beef
,
minced
pies
,
and
good
strong
beer
,
     
And
me
a
share
of
your
good
cheer
,
     
<EOS>
That
I
was
there
,
or
you
were
here
;
     
And
<EOS>
you
're
a
little
saucy
dear
.
  
<EOS>
Good
-
morrow
again
,
dear
sirrahs
;
one
can
not
rise
for
your
play
.
 
<EOS>
At
night
.
 
<EOS>
I
went
this
morning
to
visit
Lady
Kerry
and
Lord
Shelburne
;
and
they
made
me
dine
with
them
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
Andrew
Fountaine
is
better
.
 
<EOS>
And
now
let
us
come
and
see
what
this
saucy
,
dear
letter
of
MD
says
.
 
<EOS>
Come
out
,
letter
,
come
out
from
between
the
sheets
;
here
it
is
underneath
,
and
it
will
not
come
out
.
 
<EOS>
Come
out
again
<EOS>
,
I
say
:
 
so
there
.
 
<EOS>
Here
it
is
.
 
<EOS>
What
says
Presto
to
me
,
pray
?
<EOS>
says
it
.
<EOS>
Come
,
and
let
me
answer
for
you
to
your
ladies
.
 
<EOS>
Hold
up
your
head
then
,
like
a
good
letter
.
 
<EOS>
There
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
,
how
have
you
got
up
with
Presto
,
Madam
Stella
?
<EOS>
You
write
your
eighth
when
you
receive
mine
:
 
<EOS>
now
I
write
my
twelfth
when
I
receive
your
eighth
.
 
<EOS>
Do
not
you
allow
for
what
are
upon
the
road
,
simpleton
?
<EOS>
What
say
you
to
that
?
 
<EOS>
And
so
you
kept
Presto
's
little
birthday
,
I
warrant
:
would
to
God
I
had
been
at
the
health
rather
than
here
,
where
I
have
no
manner
of
pleasure
,
nothing
but
eternal
business
upon
my
hands
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
grow
wise
in
time
;
but
no
more
of
that
:
 
only
I
say
Amen
with
my
heart
and
vitals
,
that
we
may
never
be
asunder
again
ten
days
together
while
poor
Presto
lives
.
  
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
be
merry
so
near
any
splenetic
talk
;
so
I
made
that
long
line
,
and
now
all
's
well
again
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
you
are
a
pretending
slut
,
indeed
,
with
your
fourth
and
fifth
in
the
margin
,
and
your
journal
,
and
everything
.
 
<EOS>
Wind
 
<EOS>
we
saw
no
wind
here
,
nothing
at
all
extraordinary
at
any
time
.
 
<EOS>
We
had
it
once
when
you
had
it
not
.
 
<EOS>
But
an
old
saying
and
a
true
:
       
<EOS>
"
I
hate
all
wind
,
     
Before
and
behind
,
     
From
cheeks
with
eyes
,
     
Or
from
blind
.
 
<EOS>
"
   
Your
chimney
fall
down
!
 
<EOS>
God
preserve
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
you
only
mean
a
brick
or
two
:
 
<EOS>
but
that
's
a
d####ned
lie
of
your
chimney
being
carried
to
the
next
house
with
the
wind
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
put
such
things
upon
us
;
those
matters
will
not
pass
here
:
 
keep
a
little
to
possibilities
.
 
<EOS>
My
Lord
Hertford
would
have
been
ashamed
of
such
a
stretch
.
 
<EOS>
You
should
take
care
of
what
company
you
converse
with
:
 
when
one
gets
that
faculty
,
'
tis
hard
to
break
one
's
self
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
Jemmy
Leigh
talks
of
going
over
;
but
quando
?
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
when
he
will
go
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
now
you
have
had
my
ninth
,
now
you
are
come
up
with
me
;
marry
come
up
with
you
,
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
all
that
business
of
Lady
S
#
#
#
#
.
 
<EOS>
Will
nobody
cut
that
D####y
's
throat
?
 
<EOS>
Five
hundred
pounds
<EOS>
do
you
call
poor
pay
for
living
three
months
the
life
of
a
king
?
 
<EOS>
They
say
she
died
with
grief
,
partly
,
being
forced
to
appear
as
a
witness
in
court
about
some
squabble
among
their
servants
.
 
<EOS>
The
Bishop
of
Clogher
showed
you
a
pamphlet
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
but
you
must
not
give
your
mind
to
believe
those
things
;
people
will
say
anything
.
 
<EOS>
The
Character
is
here
reckoned
admirable
,
but
most
of
the
facts
are
trifles
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
first
printed
privately
here
;
and
then
some
bold
cur
ventured
to
do
it
publicly
,
and
sold
two
thousand
in
two
days
:
 
who
the
author
is
must
remain
uncertain
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
pretend
to
know
,
impudence
?
 
<EOS>
How
durst
you
think
so
?
 
<EOS>
Pox
on
your
Parliaments
:
the
Archbishop
has
told
me
of
it
;
but
we
do
not
vouchsafe
to
know
anything
of
it
here
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
no
,
no
more
of
your
giddiness
yet
;
thank
you
,
Stella
,
for
asking
after
it
;
thank
you
;
God
Almighty
bless
you
for
your
kindness
to
poor
Presto
.
<EOS>
You
write
to
Lady
Giffard
and
your
mother
upon
what
I
advise
when
it
is
too
late
.
 
<EOS>
But
yet
I
fancy
this
bad
news
will
bring
down
stocks
so
low
,
that
one
might
buy
to
great
advantage
.
 
<EOS>
I
design
to
venture
going
to
see
your
mother
<EOS>
some
day
when
Lady
Giffard
is
abroad
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
keep
your
Rathburn
and
stuff
.
<EOS>
I
thought
he
was
to
pay
in
your
money
upon
his
houses
to
be
flung
down
about
the
what
do
you
call
it
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
Madam
Dingley
,
I
sent
your
enclosed
to
Bristol
,
but
have
not
heard
from
Raymond
since
he
went
.
 
<EOS>
Come
,
come
,
<EOS>
young
women
,
I
keep
a
good
fire
;
it
costs
me
twelvepence
a
week
,
and
I
fear
something
more
;
vex
me
,
and
I
will
have
one
in
my
bed
-
chamber
too
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
did
not
I
tell
you
but
just
now
,
we
have
no
high
winds
here
?
 
<EOS>
Have
you
forgot
already
?
 
<EOS>
Now
you
're
at
it
again
,
silly
Stella
;
why
does
your
mother
say
my
candles
are
scandalous
?
 
<EOS>
They
are
good
sixes
in
the
pound
,
and
she
said
I
was
extravagant
enough
to
burn
them
by
daylight
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
burn
fewer
at
a
time
than
one
.
 
<EOS>
What
would
people
have
?
 
<EOS>
The
D
#
#
#
#
burst
Hawkshaw
.
 
<EOS>
He
told
me
he
had
not
the
box
;
and
the
next
day
Sterne
told
me
he
had
sent
it
a
fortnight
ago
.
 
<EOS>
Patrick
could
not
find
him
t'other
day
,
but
he
shall
to
-
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
Dear
life
and
heart
,
do
you
tease
me
?
<EOS>
does
Stella
tease
Presto
?
 
<EOS>
That
palsy
-
water
was
in
the
box
;
it
was
too
big
for
a
packet
,
and
I
was
afraid
of
its
breaking
.
<EOS>
Leigh
was
not
in
town
then
;
or
I
would
not
have
trusted
it
to
Sterne
,
whom
<EOS>
yet
I
have
befriended
enough
to
do
me
more
kindness
than
that
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
never
rest
till
you
have
it
,
or
till
it
is
in
a
way
for
you
to
have
it
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
dear
rogue
,
naughty
<EOS>
to
think
it
teases
me
;
how
could
I
ever
forgive
myself
for
neglecting
anything
that
related
to
your
health
?
 
<EOS>
Sure
I
were
a
Devil
if
I
did
.
  
<EOS>
See
how
far
I
am
forced
to
stand
from
Stella
,
because
I
am
afraid
she
thinks
poor
Presto
has
not
been
careful
about
her
little
things
;
I
am
sure
I
bought
them
immediately
according
to
order
,
and
packed
them
up
with
my
own
hands
,
and
sent
them
to
Sterne
,
and
was
six
times
with
him
about
sending
them
away
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
glad
you
are
pleased
with
your
glasses
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
got
another
velvet
cap
;
a
new
one
Lord
Herbert
bought
and
presented
me
one
morning
I
was
at
breakfast
with
him
,
where
he
was
as
merry
and
easy
as
ever
I
saw
him
,
yet
had
received
a
challenge
half
an
hour
before
,
and
half
an
hour
after
fought
a
duel
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
about
ten
days
ago
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
mistaken
in
your
guesses
about
Tatlers
:
 
<EOS>
I
did
neither
write
that
on
Noses
nor
Religion
,
nor
do
I
send
him
of
late
any
hints
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
Stella
,
when
I
read
your
letter
,
I
was
not
uneasy
at
all
;
but
when
I
came
to
answer
the
particulars
,
and
found
that
you
had
not
received
your
box
,
it
grated
me
to
the
heart
,
because
I
thought
,
through
your
little
words
,
that
you
imagined
I
had
not
taken
the
care
I
ought
.
 
<EOS>
But
there
has
been
some
blunder
in
this
matter
,
<EOS>
which
I
will
know
to
-
morrow
,
and
write
to
Sterne
,
for
fear
he
should
not
be
within
.
 
<EOS>
And
pray
,
pray
,
Presto
,
pray
now
do
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
Raymond
was
not
above
four
times
with
me
while
he
stayed
,
and
then
only
while
I
was
dressing
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Fenton
has
written
me
another
letter
about
some
money
of
hers
in
Lady
Giffard
's
hands
,
that
is
entrusted
to
me
by
my
mother
,
not
to
come
to
her
husband
.
 
<EOS>
I
send
my
letters
constantly
every
fortnight
,
and
,
if
you
will
have
them
oftener
,
you
may
,
but
then
they
will
be
the
shorter
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
,
let
Parvisol
sell
the
horse
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
spoke
to
you
of
it
in
a
former
letter
:
 
<EOS>
I
am
glad
you
are
rid
of
him
,
and
was
in
pain
while
I
thought
you
rode
him
;
but
,
if
he
would
buy
you
another
,
or
anybody
else
,
and
that
you
could
be
often
able
to
ride
,
why
do
not
you
do
it
?
  
<EOS>

.
 
<EOS>
I
went
this
morning
early
to
the
Secretary
of
State
,
Mr.
St.
John
;
and
he
told
me
from
Mr.
Harley
that
the
warrant
was
now
drawn
,
in
order
for
a
patent
for
the
First
-
Fruits
:
 
<EOS>
it
must
pass
through
several
offices
,
and
take
up
some
time
,
because
in
things
the
Queen
gives
they
are
always
considerate
;
but
that
,
he
assures
me
,
'
tis
granted
and
done
,
and
past
all
dispute
,
and
desires
I
will
not
be
in
any
pain
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
write
again
to
the
Archbishop
to
-
morrow
,
and
tell
him
this
,
and
I
desire
you
will
say
it
on
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
From
the
Secretary
I
went
to
Mr.
Sterne
,
who
said
he
would
write
to
you
to
-
night
;
and
that
the
box
must
be
at
Chester
;
and
that
some
friend
of
his
goes
very
soon
,
and
will
carry
it
over
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
with
Mr.
Secretary
St.
John
,
and
at
six
went
to
Darteneufs
house
to
drink
punch
with
him
,
and
Mr.
Addison
,
and
little
Harrison
,
a
young
poet
,
whose
fortune
I
am
making
.
 
<EOS>
Steele
was
to
have
been
there
,
but
came
not
,
nor
never
did
twice
,
since
I
knew
him
,
to
any
appointment
.
 
<EOS>
I
stayed
till
past
eleven
,
and
am
now
in
bed
.
 
<EOS>
Steele
's
last
Tatler
came
out
to
-
day
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
see
it
before
this
comes
to
you
,
and
how
he
takes
leave
of
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
He
never
told
so
much
as
Mr.
Addison
of
it
,
who
was
surprised
as
much
as
I
;
but
,
to
say
the
truth
,
it
was
time
,
for
he
grew
cruel
dull
and
dry
.
 
<EOS>
To
my
knowledge
he
had
several
good
hints
to
go
upon
;
but
he
was
so
lazy
and
weary
of
the
work
that
he
would
not
improve
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
will
send
this
after
to
-
morrow
:
 
<EOS>
shall
I
before
'
tis
full
,
Dingley
?

<EOS>
Lord
Peterborow
yesterday
called
me
into
a
barber
's
shop
,
and
there
we
talked
deep
politics
:
 
<EOS>
he
desired
me
to
dine
with
him
to
-
day
at
the
Globe
in
the
Strand
;
he
said
he
would
show
me
so
clearly
how
to
get
Spain
,
that
I
could
not
possibly
doubt
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
went
to
-
day
accordingly
,
and
saw
him
among
half
a
dozen
lawyers
and
attorneys
and
hang
-
dogs
,
signing
of
deeds
and
stuff
before
his
journey
;
for
he
goes
to
-
morrow
to
Vienna
.
 
<EOS>
I
sat
among
that
scurvy
company
till
after
four
,
but
heard
nothing
of
Spain
;
only
I
find
,
by
what
he
told
me
before
,
that
he
fears
he
shall
do
no
good
in
his
present
journey
.
 
<EOS>
We
are
to
be
mighty
constant
correspondents
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
took
my
leave
of
him
,
and
called
at
Sir
Andrew
Fountaine
's
,
who
mends
much
.
 
<EOS>
I
came
home
,
<EOS>
an't
<EOS>
please
you
,
at
six
,
and
have
been
studying
till
now
past
eleven
.
  
<EOS>

.
 
<EOS>
Morning
.
 
<EOS>
Morrow
,
little
dears
.
 
<EOS>
O
,
faith
,
I
have
been
dreaming
;
I
was
to
be
put
in
prison
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
why
,
and
I
was
so
afraid
of
a
black
dungeon
;
and
then
all
I
had
been
inquiring
yesterday
of
Sir
Andrew
Fountaine
's
sickness
I
thought
was
of
poor
Stella
.
 
<EOS>
The
worst
of
dreams
is
,
that
one
wakes
just
in
the
humour
they
leave
one
.
 
<EOS>
Shall
I
send
this
to
-
day
?
 
<EOS>
With
all
my
heart
:
 
<EOS>
it
is
two
days
within
the
fortnight
;
but
may
be
MD
are
in
haste
to
have
a
round
dozen
:
 
<EOS>
and
then
how
are
you
come
up
to
me
with
your
eighth
,
young
women
?
 
<EOS>
But
you
indeed
ought
to
write
twice
slower
than
I
,
because
there
are
two
of
you
;
I
own
that
.
 
<EOS>
Well
then
,
I
will
seal
up
this
letter
by
my
morning
candle
,
and
carry
it
into
the
city
with
me
,
where
I
go
to
dine
,
and
put
it
into
the
post
-
office
with
my
own
fair
hands
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
let
me
see
whether
I
have
any
news
to
tell
MD
.
 
<EOS>
They
say
they
will
very
soon
make
some
inquiries
into
the
corruptions
of
the
late
Ministry
;
and
they
must
do
it
,
to
justify
their
turning
them
out
.
<EOS>
Atterbury
,
we
think
,
is
to
be
Dean
of
Christ
Church
in
Oxford
;
but
the
College
would
rather
have
Smalridge
 
<EOS>
What
's
all
this
to
you
?
 
<EOS>
What
care
you
for
Atterburys
and
Smalridges
?
 
<EOS>
No
,
you
care
for
nothing
but
Presto
,
faith
.
<EOS>
So
I
will
rise
,
and
bid
you
farewell
;
yet
I
am
loth
to
do
so
,
because
there
is
a
great
bit
of
paper
yet
to
talk
upon
;
but
Dingley
will
have
it
so
:
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
says
she
,
"
make
your
journals
shorter
,
and
send
them
oftener
;
"
and
so
I
will
.
<EOS>
And
I
have
cheated
you
another
way
too
;
for
this
is
clipped
paper
,
and
holds
at
least
six
lines
less
than
the
former
ones
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
tell
you
a
good
thing
I
said
to
my
Lord
Carteret
.
 
<EOS>
"
So
,
"
says
he
,
"
my
Lord
came
up
to
me
,
and
asked
me
,
"
etc
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
I
,
"
<EOS>
my
Lord
never
did
,
nor
ever
can
come
up
to
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
We
all
pun
here
sometimes
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Carteret
set
down
Prior
t'other
day
in
his
chariot
;
and
Prior
thanked
him
for
his
CHARITY
;
that
was
fit
for
Dilly
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
remember
I
heard
one
good
one
from
the
Ministry
;
which
is
really
a
shame
.
 
<EOS>
Henley
is
gone
to
the
country
for
Christmas
.
 
<EOS>
The
puppy
comes
here
without
his
wife
,
and
keeps
no
house
,
and
would
have
me
dine
with
him
at
eating
-
houses
;
but
I
have
only
done
it
once
,
and
will
do
it
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
not
seen
me
for
some
time
in
the
Coffee
-
house
,
and
asking
after
me
,
desired
Lord
Herbert
to
tell
me
I
was
a
beast
for
ever
,
after
the
order
of
Melchisedec
.
 
<EOS>
Did
you
ever
read
the
Scripture
?
 
<EOS>
It
is
only
changing
the
word
priest
to
beast
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
am
bewitched
,
to
write
so
much
in
a
morning
to
you
,
little
MD
.
 
<EOS>
Let
me
go
,
will
you
?
<EOS>
and
I
'll
come
again
to
-
night
in
a
fine
clean
sheet
of
paper
;
but
I
can
nor
will
stay
no
longer
now
;
<EOS>
no
,
I
wo
n't
,
for
all
your
wheedling
:
 
no
,
no
,
look
off
,
do
not
smile
at
me
,
and
say
,
"
Pray
,
pray
,
Presto
,
write
a
little
more
.
"
 
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
you
are
a
wheedling
slut
,
you
be
so
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
but
prithee
turn
about
,
and
let
me
go
,
do
;
'
tis
a
good
girl
,
and
do
.
 
<EOS>
O
,
faith
,
my
morning
candle
is
just
out
,
and
I
must
go
now
in
spite
of
my
teeth
;
for
my
bed
-
chamber
is
dark
with
curtains
,
and
I
am
at
the
wrong
side
.
 
<EOS>
So
farewell
,
etc
.
<EOS>
etc
.
  
<EOS>
I
am
in
the
dark
almost
:
 
<EOS>
I
must
have
another
candle
,
when
I
am
up
,
to
seal
this
;
but
I
will
fold
it
up
in
the
dark
,
and
make
what
you
can
of
this
,
for
I
can
only
see
this
paper
I
am
writing
upon

<EOS>
Service

Mrs.
Walls

Stoyte

God
Almighty

<EOS>
What
I
am
doing
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
see

but
I
will
fold
it
up

and
not
look

LETTER
13
.
 
<EOS>
LONDON
,
Jan.
4
,
1710
-
11
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
going
into
the
City
(
where
I
dined
and
put
my
12th
,
with
my
own
fair
hands
,
into
the
post
-
office
as
I
came
back
,
which
was
not
till
nine
this
night
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
with
people
that
you
never
heard
of
,
nor
is
it
worth
your
while
to
know
;
an
authoress
and
a
printer
.
 
<EOS>
I
walked
home
for
exercise
,
and
at
eleven
got
to
bed
;
and
,
all
the
while
I
was
undressing
myself
<EOS>
,
there
was
I
speaking
monkey
things
in
air
,
just
as
if
MD
had
been
by
,
and
did
not
recollect
myself
till
I
got
into
bed
.
 
<EOS>
I
writ
last
night
to
the
Archbishop
,
and
told
him
the
warrant
was
drawn
for
the
First
-
Fruits
;
and
I
told
him
Lord
Peterborow
was
set
out
for
his
journey
to
Vienna
;
but
it
seems
the
Lords
have
addressed
to
have
him
stay
,
to
be
examined
about
Spanish
affairs
,
upon
this
defeat
there
,
and
to
know
where
the
fault
lay
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
writ
to
the
Archbishop
a
lie
;
but
I
think
it
was
not
a
sin
.
  
<EOS>
5
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Secretary
St.
John
sent
for
me
this
morning
so
early
,
that
I
was
forced
to
go
without
shaving
,
which
put
me
quite
out
of
method
.
 
<EOS>
I
called
at
Mr.
Ford
's
,
and
desired
him
to
lend
me
a
shaving
;
and
so
made
a
shift
to
get
into
order
again
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
!
<EOS>
here
is
an
impertinence
:
 
<EOS>
Sir
Andrew
Fountaine
's
mother
and
sister
are
come
above
a
hundred
miles
,
from
Worcester
,
to
see
him
before
he
died
.
 
<EOS>
They
got
here
but
yesterday
;
and
he
must
have
been
past
hopes
,
or
past
fears
,
before
they
could
reach
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
fell
a
scolding
when
I
heard
they
were
coming
;
and
the
people
about
him
wondered
at
me
,
and
said
what
a
mighty
content
it
would
be
on
both
sides
to
die
when
they
were
with
him
!
 
<EOS>
I
knew
the
mother
;
she
is
the
greatest
Overdo
upon
earth
;
and
the
sister
,
they
say
,
is
worse
;
the
poor
man
will
relapse
again
among
them
.
 
<EOS>
Here
was
the
scoundrel
brother
always
crying
in
the
outer
room
till
Sir
Andrew
was
in
danger
;
and
the
dog
was
to
have
all
his
estate
if
he
died
;
and
it
is
an
ignorant
,
worthless
,
scoundrel
-
rake
:
 
and
the
nurses
were
comforting
him
,
and
desiring
he
would
not
take
on
so
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
to
-
day
the
first
time
with
Ophy
Butler
and
his
wife
;
and
you
supped
with
the
Dean
,
and
lost
two
-
and
-
twenty
pence
at
cards
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
Mrs.
Walls
is
brought
to
bed
of
a
girl
,
who
died
two
days
after
it
was
christened
;
and
,
betwixt
you
and
me
<EOS>
,
she
is
not
very
sorry
:
she
loves
her
ease
and
diversions
too
well
to
be
troubled
with
children
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
go
to
bed
.
  
<EOS>
6
.
 
<EOS>
Morning
.
 
<EOS>
I
went
last
night
to
put
some
coals
on
my
fire
after
Patrick
was
gone
to
bed
;
and
there
I
saw
in
a
closet
a
poor
linnet
he
has
bought
to
bring
over
to
Dingley
:
 
<EOS>
it
cost
him
sixpence
,
and
is
as
tame
as
a
dormouse
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
he
does
not
know
he
is
a
bird
:
 
<EOS>
where
you
put
him
,
there
he
stands
,
and
seems
to
have
neither
hope
nor
fear
;
I
suppose
in
a
week
he
will
die
of
the
spleen
.
 
<EOS>
Patrick
advised
with
me
before
he
bought
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
laid
fairly
before
him
the
greatness
of
the
sum
,
and
the
rashness
of
the
attempt
;
showed
how
impossible
it
was
to
carry
him
safe
over
the
salt
sea
:
 
but
he
would
not
take
my
counsel
;
and
he
will
repent
it
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
very
cold
this
morning
in
bed
;
and
I
hear
there
is
a
good
fire
in
the
room
without
(
what
do
you
call
it
?
)
,
the
dining
-
room
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
it
will
be
good
weather
,
and
so
let
me
rise
,
sirrahs
,
do
so
.
 
<EOS>
At
night
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
this
morning
to
visit
the
Dean
,
or
Mr.
Prolocutor
<EOS>
,
I
think
you
call
him
,
do
n't
you
?
 
<EOS>
Why
should
not
I
go
to
the
Dean
's
as
well
as
you
?
 
<EOS>
A
little
,
black
man
,
of
pretty
near
fifty
?
 
<EOS>
Ay
,
the
same
.
 
<EOS>
A
good
,
pleasant
man
?
 
<EOS>
Ay
,
the
same
.
 
<EOS>
Cunning
enough
?
 
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
One
that
understands
his
own
interests
?
 
<EOS>
As
well
as
anybody
.
 
<EOS>
How
comes
it
MD
<EOS>
and
I
do
n't
meet
there
sometimes
?
 
<EOS>
A
very
good
face
,
and
abundance
of
wit
?
 
<EOS>
Do
you
know
his
lady
?
 
<EOS>
O
Lord
!
<EOS>
whom
do
you
mean
?
 
<EOS>
I
mean
Dr.
Atterbury
,
Dean
of
Carlisle
and
Prolocutor
.
 
<EOS>
Pshaw
,
Presto
,
you
are
a
fool
:
 
<EOS>
I
thought
you
had
meant
our
Dean
of
St.
Patrick
's
.
 
<EOS>
Silly
,
silly
,
silly
,
you
are
silly
,
both
are
silly
,
every
kind
of
thing
is
silly
.
 
<EOS>
As
I
walked
into
the
city
I
was
stopped
with
clusters
of
boys
and
wenches
buzzing
about
the
cake
-
shops
like
flies
.
 
<EOS>
There
had
the
fools
let
out
their
shops
two
yards
forward
into
the
streets
,
all
spread
with
great
cakes
frothed
with
sugar
,
and
stuck
with
streamers
of
tinsel
.
 
<EOS>
And
then
I
went
to
Bateman
's
the
bookseller
,
and
laid
out
eight
-
and
-
forty
shillings
for
books
.
 
<EOS>
I
bought
three
little
volumes
of
Lucian
in
French
for
our
Stella
,
and
so
and
so
.
 
<EOS>
Then
I
went
to
Garraway
's
to
meet
Stratford
and
dine
with
him
;
but
it
was
an
idle
day
with
the
merchants
,
and
he
was
gone
to
our
end
of
the
town
:
 
<EOS>
so
I
dined
with
Sir
Thomas
Frankland
at
the
Post
Office
,
and
we
drank
your
Manley
's
health
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
in
a
newspaper
that
he
was
turned
out
;
but
Secretary
St.
John
told
me
it
was
false
:
 
only
that
newswriter
is
a
plaguy
Tory
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
seen
one
bit
of
Christmas
merriment
.
  
<EOS>
7
.
 
<EOS>
Morning
.
 
<EOS>
Your
new
Lord
Chancellor
sets
out
to
-
morrow
for
Ireland
:
 
<EOS>
I
never
saw
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
carries
over
one
Trapp
a
parson
as
his
chaplain
,
a
sort
of
pretender
to
wit
,
a
second
-
rate
pamphleteer
for
the
cause
,
whom
they
pay
by
sending
him
to
Ireland
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
saw
Trapp
neither
.
 
<EOS>
I
met
Tighe
and
your
Smyth
of
Lovet
's
yesterday
by
the
Exchange
.
 
<EOS>
Tighe
<EOS>
and
I
took
no
notice
of
each
other
;
but
I
stopped
Smyth
,
and
told
him
of
the
box
that
lies
for
you
at
Chester
,
because
he
says
he
goes
very
soon
to
Ireland
,
I
think
this
week
:
 
<EOS>
and
I
will
send
this
morning
to
Sterne
,
to
take
measures
with
Smyth
;
so
good
-
morrow
,
sirrahs
,
and
let
me
rise
,
pray
.
 
<EOS>
I
took
up
this
paper
when
I
came
in
at
evening
,
<EOS>
I
mean
this
minute
,
and
then
said
I
,
"
No
,
no
,
indeed
,
MD
,
you
must
stay
"
;
and
then
was
laying
it
aside
,
but
could
not
for
my
heart
,
though
I
am
very
busy
,
till
I
just
ask
you
how
you
do
since
morning
;
by
and
by
we
shall
talk
more
,
so
let
me
leave
you
:
 
softly
down
,
little
paper
,
till
then
;
so
there
 
now
to
business
;
there
,
I
say
,
get
you
gone
;
no
,
I
will
not
push
you
neither
,
but
hand
you
on
one
side
 
<EOS>
So
 
<EOS>
Now
I
am
got
into
bed
,
I
'll
talk
with
you
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
 
Secretary
St.
John
sent
for
me
this
morning
in
all
haste
;
but
I
would
not
lose
my
shaving
,
for
fear
of
missing
church
.
 
<EOS>
I
went
to
Court
,
which
is
of
late
always
very
full
;
and
young
Manley
and
I
dined
at
Sir
Matthew
Dudley
's
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
talk
politics
.
 
<EOS>
I
protest
I
am
afraid
we
shall
all
be
embroiled
with
parties
.
 
<EOS>
The
Whigs
,
now
they
are
fallen
,
are
the
most
malicious
toads
in
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
had
now
a
second
misfortune
,
the
loss
of
several
Virginia
ships
.
 
<EOS>
I
fear
people
will
begin
to
think
that
nothing
thrives
under
this
Ministry
:
 
and
if
the
Ministry
can
once
be
rendered
odious
to
the
people
,
the
Parliament
may
be
chosen
Whig
or
Tory
as
the
Queen
pleases
.
<EOS>
Then
I
think
our
friends
press
a
little
too
hard
on
the
Duke
of
Marlborough
.
<EOS>
The
country
members
are
violent
to
have
past
faults
inquired
into
,
and
they
have
reason
;
but
I
do
not
observe
the
Ministry
to
be
very
fond
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
In
my
opinion
we
have
nothing
to
save
us
but
a
Peace
;
and
I
am
sure
we
can
not
have
such
a
one
as
we
hoped
;
and
then
the
Whigs
will
bawl
what
they
would
have
done
had
they
continued
in
power
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
the
Ministry
this
as
much
as
I
dare
;
and
shall
venture
to
say
a
little
more
to
them
,
especially
about
the
Duke
of
Marlborough
,
who
,
as
the
Whigs
give
out
,
will
lay
down
his
command
;
and
I
question
whether
ever
any
wise
State
laid
aside
a
general
who
had
been
successful
nine
years
together
,
whom
the
enemy
so
much
dread
,
and
his
own
soldiers
can
not
but
believe
must
always
conquer
;
and
you
know
that
in
war
opinion
is
nine
parts
in
ten
.
 
<EOS>
The
Ministry
hear
me
always
with
appearance
of
regard
,
and
much
kindness
;
but
I
doubt
they
let
personal
quarrels
mingle
too
much
with
their
proceedings
.
 
<EOS>
Meantime
,
they
seem
to
value
all
this
as
nothing
,
and
are
as
easy
and
merry
as
if
they
had
nothing
in
their
hearts
or
upon
their
shoulders
;
like
physicians
,
who
endeavour
to
cure
,
but
feel
no
grief
,
whatever
the
patient
suffers
.
 
<EOS>
Pshaw
,
what
is
all
this
?
  
<EOS>
Do
you
know
one
thing
,
that
I
find
I
can
write
politics
to
you
much
easier
than
to
anybody
alive
?
 
<EOS>
But
I
swear
my
head
is
full
;
and
I
wish
I
were
at
Laracor
,
with
dear
,
charming
MD
,
etc
.
  
<EOS>
8
.
 
<EOS>
Morning
.
 
<EOS>
Methinks
,
young
women
<EOS>
,
I
have
made
a
great
progress
in
four
days
,
at
the
bottom
of
this
side
already
,
and
no
letter
yet
come
from
MD
(
that
word
interlined
is
morning
)
.
 
<EOS>
I
find
I
have
been
writing
State
affairs
to
MD
.
<EOS>
How
do
they
relish
it
?
 
<EOS>
Why
,
anything
that
comes
from
Presto
is
welcome
;
though
really
,
to
confess
the
truth
,
if
they
had
their
choice
,
not
to
disguise
the
matter
,
they
had
rather
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
Presto
,
I
must
tell
you
,
you
grow
silly
,
says
Stella
.
 
<EOS>
That
is
but
one
body
's
opinion
,
madam
.
 
<EOS>
I
promised
to
be
with
Mr.
Secretary
St.
John
this
morning
;
but
I
am
lazy
,
and
will
not
go
,
because
I
had
a
letter
from
him
yesterday
,
to
desire
I
would
dine
there
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
I
shall
be
chid
;
but
what
care
I
?
 
<EOS>
Here
has
been
Mrs.
South
with
me
,
just
come
from
Sir
Andrew
Fountaine
,
and
going
to
market
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
still
in
a
fever
,
and
may
live
or
die
.
 
<EOS>
His
mother
and
sister
are
now
come
up
,
and
in
the
house
;
so
there
is
a
lurry
.
 
<EOS>
I
gave
Mrs.
South
half
a
pistole
for
a
New
Year
's
gift
.
 
<EOS>
So
good
-
morrow
,
dears
both
,
till
anon
.
 
<EOS>
At
night
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
!
<EOS>
I
have
been
with
Mr.
Secretary
from
dinner
till
eight
;
and
,
though
I
drank
wine
and
water
,
I
am
so
hot
!
 
<EOS>
Lady
Stanley
came
to
visit
Mrs.
St.
John
,
and
sent
up
for
me
to
make
up
a
quarrel
with
Mrs.
St.
John
,
whom
I
never
yet
saw
;
and
do
you
think
that
devil
of
a
Secretary
would
let
me
go
,
but
kept
me
by
main
force
,
though
I
told
him
I
was
in
love
with
his
lady
,
and
it
was
a
shame
to
keep
back
a
lover
,
etc
.
?
 
<EOS>
But
all
would
not
do
;
so
at
last
I
was
forced
to
break
away
,
but
never
went
up
,
it
was
then
too
late
;
and
here
I
am
,
and
have
a
great
deal
to
do
to
-
night
,
though
it
be
nine
o'clock
;
but
one
must
say
something
to
these
naughty
MD
's
,
else
there
will
be
no
quiet
.
  
<EOS>
9
.
 
<EOS>
To
-
day
Ford
and
I
set
apart
to
go
into
the
City
to
buy
books
;
but
we
only
had
a
scurvy
dinner
at
an
alehouse
;
and
he
made
me
go
to
the
tavern
and
drink
Florence
,
four
and
sixpence
a
flask
;
damned
wine
!
<EOS>
so
I
spent
my
money
,
which
I
seldom
do
,
and
passed
an
insipid
day
,
and
saw
nobody
,
and
it
is
now
ten
o'clock
,
and
I
have
nothing
to
say
,
but
that
'
tis
a
fortnight
to
-
morrow
since
I
had
a
letter
from
MD
;
but
if
I
have
it
time
enough
to
answer
here
,
'
<EOS>
tis
<EOS>
well
enough
,
otherwise
woe
betide
you
,
faith
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
go
to
the
toyman
's
,
here
just
in
Pall
Mall
,
and
he
sells
great
hugeous
battoons
;
yes
,
faith
,
and
so
he
does
.
 
<EOS>
Does
not
he
,
Dingley
?
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
faith
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
lose
your
money
this
Christmas
.
  
<EOS>
10
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
go
this
morning
to
Mr.
Secretary
St.
John
.
 
<EOS>
I
promised
yesterday
,
but
failed
,
so
ca
n't
write
any
more
till
night
to
poor
,
dear
MD
.
 
<EOS>
At
night
.
<EOS>
O
,
faith
,
Dingley
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
company
in
the
morning
,
and
could
not
go
where
I
designed
;
and
I
had
a
basket
from
Raymond
at
Bristol
,
with
six
bottles
of
wine
and
a
pound
of
chocolate
,
and
some
tobacco
to
snuff
;
and
he
writ
under
,
the
carriage
was
paid
;
but
he
lied
,
or
I
am
cheated
,
or
there
is
a
mistake
;
and
he
has
written
to
me
so
confusedly
about
some
things
,
that
Lucifer
could
not
understand
him
.
 
<EOS>
This
wine
is
to
be
drunk
with
Harley
's
brother
and
Sir
Robert
Raymond
,
Solicitor
-
General
,
in
order
to
recommend
the
Doctor
to
your
new
Lord
Chancellor
,
who
left
this
place
on
Monday
;
and
Raymond
says
he
is
hasting
to
Chester
,
to
go
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
he
leaves
his
wife
behind
;
for
when
he
left
London
he
had
no
thoughts
of
stirring
till
summer
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
suppose
he
will
be
with
you
before
this
.
 
<EOS>
Ford
came
and
desired
I
would
dine
with
him
,
because
it
was
Opera
-
day
;
which
I
did
,
and
sent
excuses
to
Lord
Shelburne
,
who
had
invited
me
.
  
<EOS>
11
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
setting
up
a
new
Tatler
,
little
Harrison
,
whom
I
have
mentioned
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
Others
have
put
him
on
it
,
and
I
encourage
him
;
and
he
was
with
me
this
morning
and
evening
,
showing
me
his
first
,
which
comes
out
on
Saturday
.
<EOS>
I
doubt
he
will
not
succeed
,
for
I
do
not
much
approve
his
manner
;
but
the
scheme
is
Mr.
Secretary
St.
John
's
and
mine
,
and
would
have
done
well
enough
in
good
hands
.
 
<EOS>
I
recommended
him
to
a
printer
,
whom
I
sent
for
,
and
settled
the
matter
between
them
this
evening
.
 
<EOS>
Harrison
has
just
left
me
,
and
I
am
tired
with
correcting
his
trash
.
  
<EOS>
12
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
this
morning
upon
some
business
with
Mr.
Secretary
St.
John
,
and
he
made
me
promise
to
dine
with
him
;
which
otherwise
I
would
have
done
with
Mr.
Harley
,
whom
I
have
not
been
with
these
ten
days
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
but
think
they
have
mighty
difficulties
upon
them
;
yet
I
always
find
them
as
easy
and
disengaged
as
schoolboys
on
a
holiday
.
 
<EOS>
Harley
has
the
procuring
of
five
or
six
millions
on
his
shoulders
,
and
the
Whigs
will
not
lend
a
groat
;
which
is
the
only
reason
of
the
fall
of
stocks
:
 
for
they
are
like
Quakers
and
fanatics
,
that
will
only
deal
among
themselves
,
while
all
others
deal
indifferently
with
them
.
 
<EOS>
Lady
Marlborough
offers
,
if
they
will
let
her
keep
her
employments
,
never
to
come
into
the
Queen
's
presence
.
 
<EOS>
The
Whigs
say
the
Duke
of
Marlborough
will
serve
no
more
;
but
I
hope
and
think
otherwise
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
to
Heaven
<EOS>
I
were
this
minute
with
MD
at
Dublin
;
for
I
am
weary
of
politics
,
that
give
me
such
melancholy
prospects
.
  
<EOS>
13
.
 
<EOS>
O
,
faith
<EOS>
,
I
had
an
ugly
giddy
fit
last
night
in
my
chamber
,
and
I
have
got
a
new
box
of
pills
to
take
,
and
hope
I
shall
have
no
more
<EOS>
this
good
while
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
tell
you
before
,
because
it
would
vex
you
,
little
rogues
;
but
now
it
is
over
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
to
-
day
with
Lord
Shelburne
;
and
to
-
day
<EOS>
little
Harrison
's
new
Tatler
came
out
:
 
<EOS>
there
is
not
much
in
it
,
but
I
hope
he
will
mend
.
 
<EOS>
You
must
understand
that
,
upon
Steele
's
leaving
off
,
there
were
two
or
three
scrub
Tatlers
came
out
,
and
one
of
them
holds
on
still
,
and
to
-
day
it
advertised
against
Harrison
's
;
and
so
there
must
be
disputes
which
are
genuine
,
like
the
strops
for
razors
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
afraid
the
little
toad
has
not
the
true
vein
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
tell
you
a
copy
of
verses
.
 
<EOS>
When
Mr.
St.
John
was
turned
out
from
being
Secretary
at
War
,
three
years
ago
,
he
retired
to
the
country
:
 
there
<EOS>
he
was
talking
of
something
he
would
have
written
over
his
summer
-
house
,
and
a
gentleman
gave
him
these
verses
        
From
business
and
the
noisy
world
retired
,
     
Nor
vexed
by
love
,
nor
by
ambition
fired
;
     
<EOS>
Gently
I
wait
the
call
of
Charon
's
boat
,
     
Still
drinking
like
a
fish
,
and
 
like
a
stoat
.
  
<EOS>
He
swore
to
me
he
could
hardly
bear
the
jest
;
for
he
pretended
to
retire
like
a
philosopher
,
though
he
was
but
twenty
-
eight
years
old
:
 
<EOS>
and
I
believe
the
thing
was
true
:
 
for
he
had
been
a
thorough
rake
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
the
three
grave
lines
do
introduce
the
last
well
enough
.
 
<EOS>
Od
<EOS>
so
,
but
I
will
go
sleep
;
I
sleep
early
now
.
  
<EOS>

.
 
<EOS>
O
,
faith
,
young
women
<EOS>
,
I
want
a
letter
from
MD
;
'
tis
now
nineteen
days
since
I
had
the
last
:
 
and
where
have
I
room
to
answer
it
,
pray
?
 
<EOS>
I
hope
I
shall
send
this
away
without
any
answer
at
all
;
for
I
'll
hasten
it
,
and
away
it
goes
on
Tuesday
,
by
which
time
this
side
will
be
full
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
send
it
two
days
sooner
on
purpose
out
of
spite
;
and
the
very
next
day
after
,
you
must
know
,
your
letter
will
come
,
and
then
'
tis
too
late
,
and
I
will
so
laugh
,
never
saw
the
like
!
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
spring
with
us
already
.
 
<EOS>
I
ate
asparagus
t'other
day
.
 
<EOS>
Did
you
ever
see
such
a
frostless
winter
?
 
<EOS>
Sir
Andrew
Fountaine
lies
still
extremely
ill
;
it
costs
him
ten
guineas
a
day
to
doctors
,
surgeons
,
and
apothecaries
,
and
has
done
so
these
three
weeks
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
to
-
day
with
Mr.
Ford
;
he
sometimes
chooses
to
dine
at
home
,
and
I
am
content
to
dine
with
him
;
and
at
night
I
called
at
the
Coffee
-
house
,
where
I
had
not
been
in
a
week
,
and
talked
coldly
a
while
with
Mr.
Addison
.
 
<EOS>
All
our
friendship
and
dearness
are
off
:
 
<EOS>
we
are
civil
acquaintance
,
talk
words
of
course
,
of
when
we
shall
meet
,
and
that
is
all
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
been
at
any
house
with
him
these
six
weeks
:
<EOS>
t'other
day
we
were
to
have
dined
together
at
the
Comptroller
's
;
but
I
sent
my
excuses
,
being
engaged
to
the
Secretary
of
State
.
 
<EOS>
Is
not
it
odd
?
<EOS>
But
I
think
he
has
used
me
ill
;
and
I
have
used
him
too
well
,
at
least
his
friend
Steele
.
  
<EOS>
15
.
 
<EOS>
It
has
cost
me
three
guineas
to
-
day
for
a
periwig
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
undone
!
 
<EOS>
It
was
made
by
a
Leicester
lad
,
who
married
Mr.
Worrall
's
daughter
,
where
my
mother
lodged
;
so
I
thought
it
would
be
cheap
,
and
especially
since
he
lives
in
the
city
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
London
lickpenny
:
 
<EOS>
I
find
it
true
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
given
Harrison
hints
for
another
Tatler
to
-
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
The
jackanapes
wants
a
right
taste
:
 
<EOS>
I
doubt
he
wo
n't
do
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
with
my
friend
Lewis
of
the
Secretary
's
office
,
and
am
got
home
early
,
because
I
have
much
business
to
do
;
but
before
I
begin
,
I
must
needs
say
something
to
MD
,
faith
 
No
,
faith
<EOS>
,
I
lie
,
it
is
<EOS>
but
nineteen
days
to
-
day
since
my
last
from
MD
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
got
Mr.
Harley
to
promise
that
whatever
changes
are
made
in
the
Council
,
the
Bishop
of
Clogher
shall
not
be
removed
,
and
he
has
got
a
memorial
accordingly
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
let
the
Bishop
know
so
much
in
a
post
or
two
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
a
secret
;
but
I
know
he
has
enemies
,
and
they
shall
not
be
gratified
,
if
they
designed
any
such
thing
,
which
perhaps
they
might
;
for
some
changes
there
will
be
made
.
 
<EOS>
So
drink
up
your
claret
,
and
be
quiet
,
and
do
not
lose
your
money
.
  
<EOS>
16
.
 
<EOS>
Morning
.
 
<EOS>
Faith
,
I
will
send
this
letter
to
-
day
to
shame
you
,
<EOS>
if
I
han't
one
from
MD
before
night
,
that
's
certain
.
 
<EOS>
Wo
n't
you
grumble
for
want
of
the
third
side
,
pray
now
?
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
I
warrant
you
;
yes
,
yes
,
you
shall
have
the
third
<EOS>
,
you
shall
so
,
when
you
can
catch
it
,
some
other
time
;
when
you
be
writing
girls
.
 
<EOS>
O
,
faith
<EOS>
,
I
think
I
wo
n't
stay
till
night
,
but
seal
up
this
just
now
,
and
carry
it
in
my
pocket
,
and
whip
it
into
the
post
-
office
as
I
come
home
at
evening
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
going
out
early
this
morning
.
 
<EOS>
Patrick
's
bills
for
coals
and
candles
,
etc
.
,
come
sometimes
to
three
shillings
a
week
;
I
keep
very
good
fires
,
though
the
weather
be
warm
.
 
<EOS>
Ireland
will
never
be
happy
till
you
get
small
coal
likewise
;
nothing
so
easy
,
so
convenient
,
so
cheap
,
so
pretty
,
for
lighting
a
fire
.
 
<EOS>
My
service
to
Mrs.
Stoyte
and
Walls
;
has
she
a
boy
or
a
girl
?
 
<EOS>
A
girl
,
hum
;
and
died
in
a
week
,
humm
;
and
was
poor
Stella
forced
to
stand
for
godmother
?
 
<EOS>
Let
me
know
how
accompts
stand
,
that
you
may
have
your
money
betimes
.
 
<EOS>
There
's
four
months
for
my
lodging
<EOS>
,
that
must
be
thought
on
too
:
 
and
so
go
dine
with
Manley
,
and
lose
your
money
,
do
,
extravagant
sluttikin
,
but
do
n't
fret
.
 
<EOS>
It
will
be
just
three
weeks
when
I
have
the
next
letter
,
that
's
to
-
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
Farewell
,
dearest
beloved
MD
;
and
love
poor
,
poor
Presto
,
who
has
not
had
one
happy
day
since
he
left
you
,
as
hope
saved
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
the
last
sally
I
will
ever
make
,
but
I
hope
it
will
turn
to
some
account
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
done
more
for
these
,
and
I
think
they
are
more
honest
than
the
last
;
however
,
I
will
not
be
disappointed
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
make
MD
and
me
easy
;
and
I
never
desired
more
.
 
<EOS>
Farewell

LETTER
14
.
 
<EOS>
LONDON
,
Jan.
16
,
171O-11
.
  
<EOS>
O
faith
,
young
women
<EOS>
,
I
have
sent
my
letter
N.13
without
one
crumb
of
an
answer
to
any
of
MD
's
,
there
's
for
you
now
;
and
yet
<EOS>
Presto
ben't
angry
,
faith
,
not
a
bit
,
only
he
will
begin
to
be
in
pain
next
Irish
post
,
except
he
sees
MD
's
little
handwriting
in
the
glass
-
frame
at
the
bar
of
St.
James
's
Coffee
-
house
,
where
Presto
would
never
go
but
for
that
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
Presto
is
at
home
,
God
help
him
,
every
night
from
six
till
bed
-
time
,
and
has
as
little
enjoyment
or
pleasure
in
life
at
present
as
anybody
in
the
world
,
although
in
full
favour
with
all
the
Ministry
.
 
<EOS>
As
hope
saved
,
nothing
gives
Presto
any
sort
of
dream
of
happiness
but
a
letter
now
and
then
from
his
own
dearest
MD
.
 
<EOS>
I
love
the
expectation
of
it
;
and
when
it
does
not
come
,
I
comfort
myself
that
I
have
it
yet
to
be
happy
with
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
faith
,
and
when
I
write
to
MD
,
I
am
happy
too
;
it
is
just
as
if
methinks
<EOS>
you
were
here
,
and
I
prating
to
you
,
and
telling
you
where
I
have
been
:
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
says
you
,
"
Presto
,
come
,
where
have
you
been
to
-
day
?
<EOS>
come
,
let
's
hear
now
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
so
then
I
answer
:
 
<EOS>
"
Ford
and
I
were
visiting
Mr.
Lewis
and
Mr.
Prior
;
and
Prior
has
given
me
a
fine
Plautus
;
and
then
Ford
would
have
had
me
dine
at
his
lodgings
,
and
so
I
would
not
;
and
<EOS>
so
I
dined
with
him
at
an
eating
-
house
,
which
I
have
not
done
five
times
since
I
came
here
;
and
<EOS>
so
I
came
home
,
after
visiting
Sir
Andrew
Fountaine
's
mother
and
sister
,
and
Sir
Andrew
Fountaine
is
mending
,
though
slowly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
17
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
making
,
this
morning
,
some
general
visits
,
and
at
twelve
I
called
at
the
Coffee
-
house
for
a
letter
from
MD
;
so
the
man
said
he
had
given
it
to
Patrick
.
 
<EOS>
Then
I
went
to
the
Court
of
Requests
and
Treasury
,
to
find
Mr.
Harley
,
and
,
after
some
time
spent
in
mutual
reproaches
,
I
promised
to
dine
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
stayed
there
till
seven
,
then
called
at
Sterne
's
and
Leigh
's
to
talk
about
your
box
,
and
to
have
it
sent
by
Smyth
.
 
<EOS>
Sterne
says
he
has
been
making
inquiries
,
and
will
set
things
right
as
soon
as
possible
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
it
lies
at
Chester
,
at
least
I
hope
so
,
and
only
wants
a
lift
over
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
Here
has
little
Harrison
been
to
complain
that
the
printer
I
recommended
to
him
for
his
Tatler
is
a
coxcomb
;
and
yet
to
see
how
things
will
happen
;
for
this
very
printer
is
my
cousin
,
his
name
is
Dryden
Leach
;
did
you
never
hear
of
Dryden
Leach
,
he
that
prints
the
Postman
?
 
<EOS>
He
acted
Oroonoko
;
he
's
in
love
with
Miss
Cross
.
 
<EOS>
W
ell
,
so
I
came
home
to
read
my
letter
from
Stella
,
but
the
dog
Patrick
was
abroad
;
at
last
he
came
,
and
I
got
my
letter
.
 
<EOS>
I
found
another
hand
had
superscribed
it
;
when
I
opened
it
,
I
found
it
written
all
in
French
,
and
subscribed
Bernage
:
 
<EOS>
faith
,
I
was
ready
to
fling
it
at
Patrick
's
head
.
 
<EOS>
Bernage
tells
me
he
had
been
to
desire
your
recommendation
to
me
,
to
make
him
a
captain
;
and
your
cautious
answer
,
that
he
had
as
much
power
with
me
as
you
,
was
a
notable
one
;
if
you
were
here
,
I
would
present
you
to
the
Ministry
as
a
person
of
ability
.
 
<EOS>
Bernage
should
let
me
know
where
to
write
to
him
;
this
is
the
second
letter
I
have
had
without
any
direction
;
however
,
I
beg
<EOS>
I
may
not
have
a
third
,
but
that
you
will
ask
him
,
and
send
me
how
I
shall
direct
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
,
tell
him
that
if
regiments
are
to
be
raised
here
,
as
he
says
,
I
will
speak
to
George
Granville
,
Secretary
at
War
,
to
make
him
a
captain
;
and
use
what
other
interest
I
conveniently
can
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
that
is
enough
,
and
so
tell
him
,
and
do
not
trouble
me
with
his
letters
,
when
I
expect
them
from
MD
;
do
you
hear
,
young
women
?
<EOS>
write
to
Presto
.
  
<EOS>

.
 
<EOS>
I
was
this
morning
with
Mr.
Secretary
St.
John
,
and
we
were
to
dine
at
Mr.
Harley
's
alone
,
about
some
business
of
importance
;
but
there
were
two
or
three
gentlemen
there
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Secretary
and
I
went
together
from
his
office
to
Mr.
Harley
's
,
and
thought
to
have
been
very
wise
;
but
the
deuce
a
bit
,
the
company
stayed
,
and
more
came
,
and
Harley
went
away
at
seven
,
and
the
Secretary
<EOS>
and
I
stayed
with
the
rest
of
the
company
till
eleven
;
I
would
then
have
had
him
come
away
;
but
he
was
in
for't
;
and
though
he
swore
he
would
come
away
at
that
flask
,
there
I
left
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
wonder
at
the
civility
of
these
people
;
when
he
saw
I
would
drink
no
more
,
he
would
always
pass
the
bottle
by
me
,
and
yet
I
could
not
keep
the
toad
from
drinking
himself
,
nor
he
would
not
let
me
go
neither
,
nor
Masham
,
who
was
with
us
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
got
home
,
I
found
a
parcel
directed
to
me
;
and
opening
it
<EOS>
,
I
found
a
pamphlet
written
entirely
against
myself
,
not
by
name
,
but
against
something
I
writ
:
it
is
pretty
civil
,
and
affects
to
be
so
,
and
I
think
I
will
take
no
notice
of
it
;
'
tis
against
something
written
very
lately
;
and
indeed
I
know
not
what
to
say
,
nor
do
I
care
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
you
are
a
saucy
rogue
for
losing
your
money
to
-
day
at
Stoyte
's
;
to
let
that
bungler
beat
you
,
fie
,
Stella
,
an't
<EOS>
you
ashamed
?
 
<EOS>
Well
,
I
forgive
you
this
once
,
never
do
so
again
;
no
,
noooo
.
 
<EOS>
Kiss
and
be
friends
,
sirrah
.
 
<EOS>
Come
,
let
me
go
sleep
,
I
go
earlier
to
bed
than
formerly
;
and
have
not
been
out
<EOS>
so
late
these
two
months
;
but
the
Secretary
was
in
a
drinking
humour
.
 
<EOS>
So
good
-
night
,
myownlittledearsaucyinsolentrogues
.
  
<EOS>
19
.
 
<EOS>
Then
you
read
that
long
word
in
the
last
line
;
no
,
faith
,
han't
you
.
<EOS>
Well
,
when
will
this
letter
come
from
our
MD
?
<EOS>
to
-
morrow
or
next
day
without
fail
;
yes
,
faith
,
<EOS>
and
so
it
is
coming
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
an
insipid
snowy
day
,
no
walking
day
,
and
I
dined
gravely
with
Mrs.
Vanhomrigh
,
and
came
home
,
and
am
now
got
to
bed
a
little
after
ten
;
I
remember
old
Culpepper
's
maxim
:
       
<EOS>
"
Would
you
have
a
settled
head
,
      
<EOS>
You
must
early
go
to
bed
:
      
<EOS>
I
tell
you
,
and
I
tell't
again
,
      
<EOS>
You
must
be
in
bed
at
ten
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
2O.
 
<EOS>
And
so
I
went
to
-
day
with
my
new
wig
,
o
hoao
,
to
visit
Lady
Worsley
,
whom
I
had
not
seen
before
,
although
she
was
near
a
month
in
town
.
 
<EOS>
Then
I
walked
in
the
Park
to
find
Mr.
Ford
,
whom
I
had
promised
to
meet
;
and
coming
down
the
Mall
,
who
should
come
towards
me
but
Patrick
,
and
gives
me
five
letters
out
of
his
pocket
.
 
<EOS>
I
read
the
superscription
of
the
first
,
"
Pshoh
,
"
said
I
;
of
the
second
,
"
Pshoh
"
again
;
of
the
third
,
"
Pshah
,
pshah
,
pshah
"
;
of
the
fourth
,
"
A
gad
,
a
gad
,
a
gad
<EOS>
,
I
'm
in
a
rage
"
;
of
the
fifth
and
last
,
"
O
hoooa
;
ay
marry
this
is
something
,
this
is
our
MD
"
;
so
truly
we
opened
it
,
I
think
immediately
,
and
it
began
the
most
impudently
in
the
world
,
thus
:
 
"
Dear
Presto
<EOS>
,
We
are
even
thus
far
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Now
we
are
even
,
"
quoth
Stephen
,
when
he
gave
his
wife
six
blows
for
one
.
 
<EOS>
I
received
your
ninth
four
days
after
I
had
sent
my
thirteenth
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
'll
reckon
with
you
anon
about
that
,
young
women
.
 
<EOS>
Why
did
not
you
recant
at
the
end
of
your
letter
,
when
you
got
my
eleventh
,
tell
me
that
,
<EOS>
huzzies
base
?
<EOS>
were
we
even
then
,
were
we
,
sirrah
?
 
<EOS>
But
I
wo
n't
answer
your
letter
now
<EOS>
,
I
'll
keep
it
for
another
time
.
 
<EOS>
We
had
a
great
deal
of
snow
to
-
day
,
and
'
tis
terrible
cold
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
with
Ford
,
because
it
was
his
Opera
-
day
and
snowed
,
so
I
did
not
care
to
stir
farther
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
send
tomorrow
to
Smyth
.
  
<EOS>
21
.
 
<EOS>
Morning
.
 
<EOS>
It
has
snowed
terribly
all
night
,
and
is
vengeance
cold
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
yet
up
,
but
can
not
write
long
;
my
hands
will
freeze
.
 
<EOS>
"
Is
there
a
good
fire
,
Patrick
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
I
will
rise
;
come
,
take
away
the
candle
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
know
I
write
on
the
dark
side
of
my
bed
-
chamber
,
and
am
forced
to
have
a
candle
till
I
rise
,
for
the
bed
stands
between
me
and
the
window
,
and
I
keep
the
curtains
shut
this
cold
weather
.
 
<EOS>
So
pray
<EOS>
let
me
rise
;
and
Patrick
,
here

away

<EOS>
At
night

<EOS>
We
are
now
here
in
high
frost
and
snow
,
the
largest
fire
can
hardly
keep
us
warm

<EOS>
It
is
very
ugly
walking
;
a
baker
's
boy
broke
his
thigh
yesterday
.
 
<EOS>
I
walk
slow
,
make
short
steps
,
and
never
tread
on
my
heel
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
<EOS>
a
good
proverb
the
Devonshire
people
have
<EOS>
:
       
"
Walk
fast
in
snow
,
      
In
frost
walk
slow
;
      
And
still
as
you
go
,
      
Tread
on
your
toe
.
   
<EOS>
When
frost
and
snow
are
both
together
,
   
Sit
by
the
fire
,
and
spare
shoe
-
leather

"
  
<EOS>
I
dined
to
-
day
with
Dr.
Cockburn
,
but
will
not
do
so
again
in
haste
,
he
has
generally
such
a
parcel
of
Scots
with
him
.

Starving

Do
n't
you
remember
I
used
to
come
into
your
chamber
,
and
turn
Stella
out
of
her
chair
,
and
rake
up
the
fire
in
a
cold
morning
,
and
cry
Uth

<EOS>
etc
.
 
<EOS>
O
,
faith
<EOS>
,
I
must
rise
,
my
hand
is
so
cold
I
can
write
no
more

<EOS>
So
good

At
night

<EOS>
I
went
this
morning
to
Lady
Giffard
's
house
,
and
saw
your
mother
,
and
made
her
give
me
a
pint
bottle
of
palsy
-
water
,
which
I
brought
home
in
my
pocket
;
and
sealed
and
tied
up
in
a
paper
,
and
sent
it
to
Mr.
Smyth
,
who
goes
to
-
morrow
for
Ireland
,
and
sent
a
letter
to
him
to
desire
his
care
of
it
,
and
that
he
would
inquire
at
Chester
about
the
box
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
not
within
:
 
<EOS>
so
the
bottle
and
letter
were
left
for
him
at
his
lodgings
,
with
strict
orders
to
give
them
to
him
;
and
I
will
send
Patrick
in
a
day
or
two
,
to
know
whether
it
was
given
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
Dr.
Stratford
and
I
dined
to
-
day
with
Mr.
Stratford
in
the
City
,
by
appointment
;
but
I
chose
to
walk
there
,
for
exercise
in
the
frost
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
weather
had
given
a
little
,
as
you
women
call
it
,
so
it
was
something
slobbery
.
 
<EOS>
I
did
not
get
home
till
nine
.
       
<EOS>
And
now
I
'm
in
bed
,
     
To
break
your
head
.

<EOS>
Morning
.
 
<EOS>
They
tell
me
it
freezes
again
,
but
it
is
not
so
cold
as
yesterday
:
 
<EOS>
so
now
I
will
answer
a
bit
of
your
letter
.
 
<EOS>
At
night
.
 
<EOS>
O
,
faith
,
I
was
just
going
to
answer
some
of
our
MD
's
letter
this
morning
,
when
a
printer
came
in
about
some
business
,
and
stayed
an
hour
;
so
I
rose
,
and
then
came
in
Ben
Tooke
,
and
then
I
shaved
and
scribbled
;
and
it
was
such
a
terrible
day
,
I
could
not
stir
out
till
one
,
and
<EOS>
then
I
called
at
Mrs.
Barton
's
,
and
we
went
to
Lady
Worsley
's
,
where
we
were
to
dine
by
appointment
.
 
<EOS>
The
Earl
of
Berkeley
is
going
to
be
married
to
Lady
Louisa
Lennox
,
the
Duke
of
Richmond
's
daughter
.
 
<EOS>
I
writ
this
night
to
Dean
Sterne
,
and
bid
him
tell
you
all
about
the
bottle
of
palsy
-
water
by
Smyth
;
and
to
-
morrow
morning
I
will
say
something
to
your
letter
.
  
<EOS>
24
.
 
<EOS>
Morning
.
 
<EOS>
Come
now
to
your
letter
.
 
<EOS>
As
for
your
being
even
with
me
,
I
have
spoken
to
that
already
.
 
<EOS>
So
now
,
my
dearly
beloved
,
let
us
proceed
to
the
next
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
always
grumbling
that
<EOS>
you
han't
letters
fast
enough
;
"
surely
we
shall
have
your
tenth
;
"
and
yet
,
before
you
end
your
letter
,
you
own
<EOS>
you
have
my
eleventh
.
 
<EOS>
And
why
did
not
MD
go
into
the
country
with
the
Bishop
of
Clogher
?
<EOS>
faith
,
such
a
journey
would
have
done
you
good
;
Stella
should
have
rode
,
and
Dingley
gone
in
the
coach
.
 
<EOS>
The
Bishop
of
Kilmore
<EOS>
I
know
nothing
of
;
he
is
old
,
and
may
die
;
he
lives
in
some
obscure
corner
,
for
I
never
heard
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
As
for
my
old
friends
,
if
you
mean
the
Whigs
,
I
never
see
them
,
as
you
may
find
by
my
journals
,
except
Lord
Halifax
,
and
him
very
seldom
;
Lord
Somers
never
since
the
first
visit
,
for
he
has
been
a
false
,
deceitful
rascal
.
 
<EOS>
My
new
friends
are
very
kind
,
and
I
have
promises
enough
,
but
I
do
not
count
upon
them
,
and
besides
my
pretences
are
very
young
to
them
.
<EOS>
However
,
we
will
see
what
may
be
done
;
and
if
nothing
at
all
,
I
shall
not
be
disappointed
;
although
perhaps
poor
MD
may
,
and
then
I
shall
be
sorrier
for
their
sakes
than
my
own
.
 
<EOS>
Talk
of
a
merry
Christmas
(
why
do
you
write
it
<EOS>
so
then
,
young
women
?
<EOS>
sauce
for
the
goose
is
sauce
for
the
gander
)
,
I
have
wished
you
all
that
two
or
three
letters
ago
.
 
<EOS>
Good
lack
;
and
your
news
,
that
Mr.
St.
John
is
going
to
Holland
<EOS>
;
he
has
no
such
thoughts
,
to
quit
the
great
station
he
is
in
;
nor
,
if
he
had
,
could
I
be
spared
to
go
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
faith
,
politic
Madam
Stella
,
you
come
with
your
two
eggs
a
penny
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
Madam
Dingley
,
and
so
Mrs.
Stoyte
invites
you
,
and
so
you
stay
at
Donnybrook
,
and
so
you
could
not
write
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
plaguy
exact
in
your
journals
,
from
Dec.
25
to
Jan.
4
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
Smyth
and
the
palsy
-
water
I
have
handled
already
,
and
he
does
not
lodge
(
or
rather
did
not
,
for
,
poor
man
,
now
he
is
gone
)
at
Mr.
Jesse
's
,
and
all
that
stuff
;
but
we
found
his
lodging
,
and
I
went
to
Stella
's
mother
on
my
own
head
,
for
I
never
remembered
it
was
in
the
letter
to
desire
another
bottle
;
but
I
was
so
fretted
,
so
tosticated
,
and
so
impatient
that
Stella
should
have
her
water
<EOS>
(
I
mean
decently
,
do
not
be
rogues
)
,
and
so
vexed
with
Sterne
's
carelessness
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
God
,
Stella
's
illness
may
not
return
!
 
<EOS>
If
they
come
seldom
,
they
begin
to
be
weary
;
I
judge
by
myself
;
for
when
I
seldom
visit
,
I
grow
weary
of
my
acquaintance
.
 
<EOS>
Leave
a
good
deal
of
my
tenth
unanswered
!
 
<EOS>
Impudent
slut
,
when
did
you
ever
answer
my
tenth
,
or
ninth
,
or
any
other
number
?
<EOS>
or
who
desires
you
to
answer
,
provided
you
write
?
 
<EOS>
I
defy
the
D
#
#
#
#
to
answer
my
letters
:
 
<EOS>
sometimes
there
may
be
one
or
two
things
I
should
be
glad
you
would
answer
;
but
I
forget
them
,
and
you
never
think
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
never
love
answering
letters
again
,
if
you
talk
of
answering
.
<EOS>
Answering
,
quotha
!
<EOS>
pretty
answerers
truly
.
 
<EOS>
As
for
the
pamphlet
you
speak
of
,
and
call
it
scandalous
,
and
that
one
Mr.
Presto
is
said
to
write
it
,
hear
my
answer
.
 
<EOS>
Fie
,
child
,
you
must
not
mind
what
every
idle
body
tells
you
 
<EOS>
I
believe
you
lie
,
and
that
the
dogs
were
not
crying
it
when
you
said
so
;
come
,
tell
truth
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
sorry
you
go
to
St.
Mary
's
<EOS>
so
soon
,
you
will
be
as
poor
as
rats
;
that
place
will
drain
you
with
a
vengeance
:
 
besides
,
I
would
have
you
think
of
being
in
the
country
in
summer
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
Stella
,
pippins
produced
plentifully
;
Parvisol
could
not
send
from
Laracor
:
 
<EOS>
there
were
about
half
a
score
,
I
would
be
glad
to
know
whether
they
were
good
for
anything
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Walls
at
Donnybrook
with
you
;
why
is
not
she
brought
to
bed
?
 
<EOS>
Well
,
well
,
well
,
Dingley
,
pray
be
satisfied
;
you
talk
as
if
you
were
angry
about
the
Bishop
's
not
offering
you
conveniences
for
the
journey
;
and
so
he
should
.
  
<EOS>
What
sort
of
Christmas
?
 
<EOS>
Why
,
I
have
had
no
Christmas
at
all
;
and
has
it
really
been
Christmas
of
late
?
 
<EOS>
I
never
once
thought
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
My
service
to
Mrs.
Stoyte
,
and
Catherine
;
and
let
Catherine
get
the
coffee
ready
against
I
come
,
and
not
have
so
much
care
on
her
countenance
;
for
all
will
go
well
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Bernage
,
Mr.
Bernage
,
Mr.
Fiddlenage
,
I
have
had
three
letters
from
him
now
successively
;
he
sends
no
directions
,
and
how
the
D
#
#
#
#
shall
I
write
to
him
?
<EOS>
I
would
have
burnt
his
last
,
if
I
had
not
seen
Stella
's
hand
at
the
bottom
:
his
request
is
all
nonsense
.
 
<EOS>
How
can
I
assist
him
in
buying
?
<EOS>
and
if
he
be
ordered
to
go
to
Spain
,
go
he
must
,
or
else
sell
,
and
I
believe
one
can
hardly
sell
in
such
a
juncture
.
 
<EOS>
If
he
had
stayed
,
and
new
regiments
raised
,
I
would
have
used
my
endeavour
to
have
had
him
removed
;
although
I
have
no
credit
that
way
,
or
very
little
:
 
<EOS>
but
,
if
the
regiment
goes
,
he
ought
to
go
too
;
he
has
had
great
indulgence
,
and
opportunities
of
saving
;
and
I
have
urged
him
to
it
a
hundred
times
.
 
<EOS>
What
can
I
do
?
<EOS>
whenever
it
lies
in
my
power
to
do
him
a
good
office
,
I
will
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
draw
up
this
into
a
handsome
speech
,
and
represent
it
to
him
from
me
,
and
that
I
would
write
,
if
I
knew
where
to
direct
to
him
;
and
so
I
have
told
you
,
and
desired
you
would
tell
him
,
fifty
times
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
Madam
Stella
,
I
think
I
can
read
your
long
concluding
word
,
but
you
ca
n't
read
mine
after
bidding
you
good
-
night
.
 
<EOS>
And
yet
methinks
<EOS>
,
I
mend
extremely
in
my
writing
;
but
when
Stella
's
eyes
are
well
,
I
hope
to
write
as
bad
as
ever
.
 
<EOS>
So
now
I
have
answered
your
letter
,
and
mine
is
an
answer
;
for
I
lay
yours
before
me
,
and
I
look
and
write
,
and
write
and
look
,
and
look
and
write
again
.
 
<EOS>
So
good
-
morrow
,
madams
both
,
and
I
will
go
rise
,
for
I
must
rise
;
for
I
take
pills
at
night
,
and
so
I
must
rise
early
<EOS>
,
I
do
n't
know
why
.
  
<EOS>
25
.
 
<EOS>
Morning
.
 
<EOS>
I
did
not
tell
you
how
I
passed
my
time
yesterday
,
nor
bid
you
good
-
night
,
and
there
was
good
reason
.
 
<EOS>
I
went
in
the
morning
to
Secretary
St.
John
about
some
business
;
he
had
got
a
great
Whig
with
him
;
a
creature
of
the
Duke
of
Marlborough
,
who
is
a
go
-
between
to
make
peace
between
the
Duke
and
the
Ministry
:
 
<EOS>
so
he
came
out
of
his
closet
,
and
,
after
a
few
words
,
desired
I
would
dine
with
him
at
three
;
but
Mr.
Lewis
stayed
till
six
before
he
came
;
and
there
we
sat
talking
,
and
the
time
slipped
so
,
that
at
last
,
when
I
was
positive
to
go
,
it
was
past
two
o'clock
;
so
I
came
home
,
and
went
straight
to
bed
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
never
let
me
look
at
his
watch
,
and
I
could
not
imagine
it
above
twelve
when
we
went
away
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
bid
you
good
-
night
for
last
night
,
and
now
I
bid
you
good
-
morrow
,
and
I
am
still
in
bed
,
though
it
be
near
ten
,
but
I
must
rise
.
  
<EOS>

<EOS>
I
have
been
so
lazy
and
negligent
these
last
four
days
that
I
could
not
write
to
MD
.
 
<EOS>
My
head
is
not
in
order
,
and
yet
is
not
absolutely
ill
,
but
giddyish
,
and
makes
me
listless
;
I
walk
every
day
,
and
take
drops
of
Dr.
Cockburn
,
and
I
have
just
done
a
box
of
pills
;
and
to
-
day
Lady
Kerry
sent
me
some
of
her
bitter
drink
,
which
I
design
to
take
twice
a
day
,
and
hope
I
shall
grow
better
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
I
were
with
MD
;
I
long
for
spring
and
good
weather
,
and
then
I
will
come
over
.
 
<EOS>
My
riding
in
Ireland
keeps
me
well
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
very
temperate
,
and
eat
of
the
easiest
meats
as
I
am
directed
,
and
hope
the
malignity
will
go
off
;
but
one
fit
shakes
me
a
long
time
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
to
-
day
with
Lord
Mountjoy
,
yesterday
at
Mr.
Stone
's
,
in
the
City
,
on
Sunday
at
Vanhomrigh
's
,
Saturday
with
Ford
,
and
Friday
I
think
at
Vanhomrigh
's
;
and
that
is
all
the
journal
I
can
send
MD
,
for
I
was
so
lazy
while
I
was
well
,
that
I
could
not
write
.
 
<EOS>
I
thought
to
have
sent
this
to
-
night
,
but
'
tis
ten
,
and
I
'll
go
to
bed
,
and
write
on
t'other
side
to
Parvisol
to
-
morrow
,
and
send
it
on
Thursday
;
and
so
good
-
night
,
my
dears
;
and
love
Presto
,
and
be
healthy
,
and
Presto
will

LETTER
15
.
 
<EOS>
LONDON
,
Jan.
31
,
1710
-
11
.
  
<EOS>
I
am
to
send
you
my
fourteenth
to
-
morrow
;
but
my
head
,
having
some
little
disorders
,
confounds
all
my
journals
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
early
this
morning
with
Mr.
Secretary
St.
John
about
some
business
,
so
I
could
not
scribble
my
morning
lines
to
MD
.
 
<EOS>
They
are
here
intending
to
tax
all
little
printed
penny
papers
a
halfpenny
every
half
-
sheet
,
which
will
utterly
ruin
Grub
Street
,
and
I
am
endeavouring
to
prevent
it
.
 
<EOS>
Besides
,
I
was
forwarding
an
impeachment
against
a
certain
great
person
;
that
was
two
of
my
businesses
with
the
Secretary
,
were
they
not
worthy
ones
?
 
<EOS>
It
was
Ford
's
birthday
,
and
I
refused
the
Secretary
,
and
dined
with
Ford
.
 
<EOS>
We
are
here
in
as
smart
a
frost
for
the
time
as
I
have
seen
;
delicate
walking
weather
,
and
the
Canal
and
Rosamond
's
Pond
full
of
the
rabble
sliding
and
with
skates
,
if
you
know
what
those
are
.
 
<EOS>
Patrick
's
bird

freezes

and
my

Feb.

.
 
<EOS>
I
was
this
morning
with
poor
Lady
Kerry
,
who
is
much
worse
in
her
head
than
<EOS>
I.
 
She
sends
me
bottles
of
her
bitter
;
and
we
are
so
fond
of
one
another
,
because
our
ailments
are
the
same
<EOS>
;
do
n't
you
know
that
,
Madam
Stella
?
<EOS>
Han't
<EOS>
I
seen
you
conning
ailments
with
Joe
's
wife
,
and
<EOS>
some
others
,
sirrah
?
<EOS>
I
walked
into
the
City
to
dine
,
because
of
the
walk
,
for
we
must
take
care
of
Presto
's
health
,
you
know
,
because
of
poor
little
MD
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
walked
plaguy
carefully
,
for
fear
of
sliding
against
my
will
;
but
I
am
very
busy
.
  
<EOS>

.
 
<EOS>
This
morning
Mr.
Ford
came
to
me
to
walk
into
the
City
,
where
he
had
business
,
and
then
to
buy
books
at
Bateman
's
;
and
I
laid
out
one
pound
five
shillings
for
a
Strabo
and
Aristophanes
,
and
I
have
now
got
books
enough
to
make
me
another
shelf
,
and
I
will
have
more
,
or
it
shall
cost
me
a
fall
;
and
so
as
we
came
back
,
we
drank
a
flask
of
right
French
wine
at
Ben
Tooke
's
chamber
;
and
when
I
got
home
,
Mrs.
Vanhomrigh
sent
me
word
her
eldest
daughter
was
taken
suddenly
very
ill
,
and
desired
I
would
come
and
see
her
.
<EOS>
I
went
,
and
found
it
was
a
silly
trick
of
Mrs.
Armstrong
,
Lady
Lucy
's
sister
,
who
,
with
Moll
Stanhope
,
was
visiting
there
:
 
<EOS>
however
,
I
rattled
off
the
daughter
.
  
<EOS>
3
.
 
<EOS>
To
-
day
I
went
and
dined
at
Lady
Lucy
's
,
<EOS>
where
you
know
I
have
not
been
this
long
time
.
 
<EOS>
They
are
plaguy
Whigs
,
especially
the
sister
Armstrong
,
the
most
insupportable
of
all
women
,
pretending
to
wit
,
without
any
taste
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
running
down
the
last
Examiner
,
the
prettiest
I
had
read
,
with
a
character
of
the
present
Ministry
.
 
<EOS>
I
left
them
at
five
,
and
came
home
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
forgot
to
tell
you
,
that
this
morning
my
cousin
Dryden
Leach
,
the
printer
,
came
to
me
with
a
heavy
complaint
,
that
Harrison
the
new
Tatler
had
turned
him
off
,
and
taken
the
last
Tatler
's
printers
again
.
 
<EOS>
He
vowed
revenge
;
I
answered
gravely
,
and
so
he
left
me
,
and
I
have
ordered
Patrick
to
deny
me
to
him
from
henceforth
:
 
and
at
night
comes
a
letter
from
Harrison
,
telling
me
the
same
thing
,
and
excused
his
doing
it
without
my
notice
,
because
he
would
bear
all
the
blame
;
and
in
his
Tatler
of
this
day
he
tells
you
the
story
,
how
he
has
taken
his
old
officers
,
and
there
is
a
most
humble
letter
from
Morphew
and
Lillie
to
beg
his
pardon
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
And
lastly
,
this
morning
Ford
sent
me
two
letters
from
the
Coffee
-
house
(
where
I
hardly
ever
go
)
,
one
from
the
Archbishop
of
Dublin
,
and
t'other
from
 
<EOS>
Who
do
you
think
t'other
was
from
?
  
<EOS>
I
'll
tell
you
,
because
you
are
friends
;
why
,
then
it
was
,
faith
,
it
was
from
my
own
dear
little
MD
,
N.10
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
but
will
not
answer
it
now
,
no
,
<EOS>
noooooh
,
I
'll
keep
it
between
the
two
sheets
;
here
it
is
,
just
under
;
<EOS>
oh
,
I
lifted
up
the
sheet
and
saw
it
there
:
 
lie
still
,
you
sha
n't
be
answered
yet
,
little
letter
;
for
I
must
go
to
bed
,
and
take
care
of
my
head
.
  
<EOS>
4
.
 
<EOS>
I
avoid
going
to
church
yet
,
for
fear
of
my
head
,
though
it
has
been
much
better
these
last
five
or
six
days
,
since
I
have
taken
Lady
Kerry
's
bitter
.
<EOS>
Our
frost
holds
like
a
dragon
.
 
<EOS>
I
went
to
Mr.
Addison
's
,
and
dined
with
him
at
his
lodgings
;
I
had
not
seen
him
these
three
weeks
,
we
are
grown
common
acquaintance
;
yet
what
have
not
I
done
for
his
friend
Steele
?
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Harley
reproached
me
the
last
time
I
saw
him
,
that
to
please
me
he
would
be
reconciled
to
Steele
,
and
had
promised
and
appointed
to
see
him
,
and
that
Steele
never
came
.
 
<EOS>
Harrison
,
whom
Mr.
Addison
recommended
to
me
,
I
have
introduced
to
the
Secretary
of
State
,
who
has
promised
me
to
take
care
of
him
;
and
I
have
represented
Addison
himself
so
to
the
Ministry
,
that
they
think
and
talk
in
his
favour
,
though
they
hated
him
before
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
he
is
now
in
my
debt
,
and
there
's
an
end
;
and
I
never
had
the
least
obligation
to
him
,
and
there
's
another
end
.
 
<EOS>
This
evening
I
had
a
message
from
Mr.
Harley
,
desiring
to
know
whether
I
was
alive
,
and
that
I
would
dine
with
him
to
-
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
They
dine
so
late
,
that
since
my
head
has
been
wrong
I
have
avoided
being
with
them
.
  
<EOS>
Patrick
has
been
out
of
favour
these
ten
days
;
I
talk
dry
and
cross
to
him
,
and
have
called
him
"
friend
"
three
or
four
times
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
sirrahs
,
get
you
gone
.
  
<EOS>
5
.
 
<EOS>
Morning
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
going
this
morning
to
see
Prior
,
who
dines
with
me
at
Mr.
Harley
's
;
so
I
ca
n't
stay
fiddling
and
talking
with
dear
little
brats
in
a
morning
,
and
'
tis
still
terribly
cold
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
my
cold
hand
was
in
the
warmest
place
about
you
,
young
women
<EOS>
,
I
'd
give
ten
guineas
upon
that
account
with
all
my
heart
,
faith
;
oh
,
it
starves
my
thigh
;
so
I
'll
rise
and
bid
you
good
-
morrow
,
my
ladies
both
,
good
-
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
Come
,
stand
away
,
let
me
rise
:
 
Patrick
,
take
away
the
candle
.
 
<EOS>
Is
there
a
good
fire
?
 
<EOS>
So
 
up
-
a
-
dazy
.
 
<EOS>
At
night
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Harley
did
not
sit
down
till
six
,
and
I
stayed
till
eleven
;
henceforth
I
will
choose
to
visit
him
in
the
evenings
,
and
dine
with
him
no
more
if
I
can
help
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
breaks
all
my
measures
,
and
hurts
my
health
;
my
head
is
disorderly
,
but
not
ill
,
and
I
hope
it
will
mend
.
  
<EOS>
6
.
 
<EOS>
Here
has
been
such
a
hurry
with
the
Queen
's
Birthday
,
so
much
fine
clothes
,
and
the
Court
so
crowded
that
I
did
not
go
there
.
 
<EOS>
All
the
frost
is
gone
.
 
<EOS>
It
thawed
on
Sunday
,
and
so
continues
,
yet
ice
is
still
on
the
Canal
(
I
did
not
mean
that
of
Laracor
,
but
St.
James
's
Park
)
and
boys
sliding
on
it
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Ford
pressed
me
to
dine
with
him
in
his
chamber
.
 
<EOS>
Did
not
I
tell
you
Patrick
has
got
a
bird
,
a
linnet
,
to
carry
over
to
Dingley
?
 
<EOS>
It
was
very
tame
at
first
,
and
'
tis
now
the
wildest
I
ever
saw
.
 
<EOS>
He
keeps
it
in
a
closet
,
where
it
makes
a
terrible
litter
;
but
I
say
nothing
:
 
<EOS>
I
am
as
tame
as
a
clout
.
 
<EOS>
When
must
we
answer
our
MD
's
letter
?
 
<EOS>
One
of
these
odd
-
come
-
shortlies
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
a
week
old
,
you
see
,
and
no
farther
yet
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Harley
desired
I
would
dine
with
him
again
to
-
day
;
but
I
refused
him
,
for
I
fell
out
with
him
yesterday
,
and
will
not
see
him
again
till
he
makes
me
amends
:
 
<EOS>
and
so
I
go
to
bed
.
  
<EOS>
7
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
this
morning
early
with
Mr.
Lewis
of
the
Secretary
's
office
,
and
saw
a
letter
Mr.
Harley
had
sent
to
him
,
desiring
to
be
reconciled
;
but
I
was
deaf
to
all
entreaties
,
and
have
desired
Lewis
to
go
to
him
,
and
let
him
know
I
expect
further
satisfaction
.
 
<EOS>
If
we
let
these
great
Ministers
pretend
too
much
,
there
will
be
no
governing
them
.
 
<EOS>
He
promises
to
make
me
easy
,
if
I
will
but
come
and
see
him
;
but
I
wo
n't
,
and
he
shall
do
it
by
message
,
or
I
will
cast
him
off
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
tell
you
the
cause
of
our
quarrel
when
I
see
you
,
and
refer
it
to
yourselves
.
 
<EOS>
In
that
he
did
something
,
which
he
intended
for
a
favour
;
and
I
have
taken
it
quite
otherwise
,
disliking
both
the
thing
and
the
manner
,
and
it
has
heartily
vexed
me
,
and
all
I
have
said
is
truth
,
though
it
looks
like
jest
;
and
I
absolutely
refused
to
submit
to
his
intended
favour
,
and
expect
further
satisfaction
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Ford
and
I
dined
with
Mr.
Lewis
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
a
monstrous
deal
of
snow
,
and
it
has
cost
me
two
shillings
to
-
day
in
chair
and
coach
,
and
walked
till
I
was
dirty
besides
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
not
what
it
is
now
to
read
or
write
after
I
am
in
bed
.
 
<EOS>
The
last
thing
I
do
up
is
to
write
something
to
our
MD
,
and
then
get
into
bed
,
and
put
out
my
candle
,
and
so
go
sleep
as
fast
as
ever
I
can
.
 
<EOS>
But
in
the
mornings
I
do
write
sometimes
in
bed
,
as
you
know
.
  
<EOS>
8
.
 
<EOS>
Morning
.
 
<EOS>
I
HAVE
DESIRED
APRONIA
<EOS>
TO
BE
ALWAYS
CAREFUL
,
ESPECIALLY
ABOUT
THE
LEGS
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
,
do
you
see
any
such
great
wit
in
that
sentence
?
 
<EOS>
I
must
freely
own
that
I
do
not
.
 
<EOS>
But
party
carries
everything
nowadays
,
and
what
a
splutter
have
I
heard
about
the
wit
of
that
saying
,
repeated
with
admiration
above
a
hundred
times
in
half
an
hour
!
 
<EOS>
Pray
read
it
over
again
this
moment
,
and
consider
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
the
word
is
ADVISED
,
and
not
DESIRED
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
not
have
remembered
it
if
I
had
not
heard
it
so
often
.
 
<EOS>
Why
 
ay
 
<EOS>
You
must
know
I
dreamed
it
just
now
,
and
waked
with
it
in
my
mouth
.
 
<EOS>
Are
you
bit
,
or
are
you
not
,
sirrahs
?
 
<EOS>
I
met
Mr.
Harley
in
the
Court
of
Requests
,
and
he
asked
me
how
long
I
had
learnt
the
trick
of
writing
to
myself
?
 
<EOS>
He
had
seen
your
letter
through
the
glass
case
at
the
Coffee
-
house
,
and
would
swear
it
was
my
hand
;
and
Mr.
Ford
,
who
took
and
sent
it
me
,
was
of
the
same
mind
.
 
<EOS>
I
remember
others
have
formerly
said
so
too
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
was
little
MD
's
writing-
master
.
 
<EOS>
B
ut
come
,
what
is
here
to
do
,
writing
to
young
women
in
a
morning
?
 
<EOS>
I
have
other
fish
to
fry
;
so
good
-
morrow
,
my
ladies
all
,
good
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
I
'll
answer
your
letter
to
-
night
,
perhaps
I
wo
n't
;
that
's
as
saucy
little
Presto
takes
the
humour
.
 
<EOS>
At
night
.
 
<EOS>
I
walked
in
the
Park
to
-
day
in
spite
of
the
weather
,
as
I
do
always
when
it
does
not
actually
rain
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
know
what
it
has
gone
and
done
?
 
<EOS>
We
had
a
thaw
for
three
days
,
then
a
monstrous
dirt
and
snow
,
and
now
it
freezes
,
like
a
pot
-
lid
,
upon
our
snow
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
with
Lady
Betty
Germaine
,
the
first
time
since
I
came
for
England
;
and
there
did
I
sit
,
like
a
booby
,
till
eight
,
looking
over
her
and
another
lady
at
piquet
,
when
I
had
other
business
enough
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
the
coldest
day
<EOS>
I
felt
this
year
.
  
<EOS>
9
.
 
<EOS>
Morning
.
 
<EOS>
After
I
had
been
abed
an
hour
last
night
,
I
was
forced
to
rise
and
call
to
the
landlady
and
maid
to
have
the
fire
removed
in
a
chimney
below
stairs
,
which
made
my
bed
-
chamber
smoke
,
though
I
had
no
fire
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
twice
served
so
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
lay
so
miserable
an
hour
in
my
life
.
 
<EOS>
Is
it
not
plaguy
vexatious
?
 
<EOS>
It
has
snowed
all
night
,
and
rains
this
morning
.
 
<EOS>
Come
,
<EOS>
where
's
MD
's
letter
?
 
<EOS>
Come
,
Mrs.
Letter
,
make
your
appearance
.
 
<EOS>
Here
am
I
,
says
she
,
answer
me
to
my
face
.
 
<EOS>
O
,
faith
<EOS>
,
I
am
sorry
you
had
my
twelfth
so
soon
;
I
doubt
you
will
stay
longer
for
the
rest
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
so
<EOS>
"
fraid
you
have
got
my
fourteenth
while
I
am
writing
this
;
and
I
would
always
have
one
letter
from
Presto
reading
,
one
travelling
,
and
one
writing
.
 
<EOS>
As
for
the
box
,
I
now
believe
it
lost
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
directed
for
Mr.
Curry
,
at
his
house
in
Capel
Street
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
a
letter
yesterday
from
Dr.
Raymond
in
Chester
,
who
says
he
sent
his
man
everywhere
,
and
can
not
find
it
;
and
 
God
knows
whether
Mr.
Smyth
will
have
better
success
.
 
<EOS>
Sterne
spoke
to
him
,
and
I
writ
to
him
with
the
bottle
of
palsy
-
water
;
that
bottle
,
I
hope
,
will
not
miscarry
:
 
I
long
to
hear
you
have
it
.
 
<EOS>
O
,
faith
<EOS>
,
you
have
too
good
an
opinion
of
Presto
's
care
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
negligent
enough
of
everything
but
MD
,
and
I
should
not
have
trusted
Sterne
.
  
<EOS>
But
it
shall
not
go
so
:
 
<EOS>
I
will
have
one
more
tug
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
what
you
say
of
Goodman
Peasly
and
Isaac
,
I
answer
as
I
did
before
.
 
<EOS>
Fie
,
child
,
you
must
not
give
yourself
the
way
to
believe
any
such
thing
:
 
and
afterwards
,
only
for
curiosity
,
you
may
tell
me
how
these
things
are
approved
,
and
how
you
like
them
;
and
whether
they
instruct
you
in
the
present
course
of
affairs
,
and
whether
they
are
printed
in
your
town
,
or
only
sent
from
hence
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
Andrew
Fountaine
is
recovered
;
so
take
your
sorrow
again
,
but
do
n't
keep
it
,
fling
it
to
the
dogs
.
 
<EOS>
And
does
little
MD
walk
indeed
?
 
<EOS>
I
'm
glad
of
it
at
heart
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
we
have
done
with
the
plague
here
:
 
<EOS>
it
was
very
saucy
in
you
to
pretend
to
have
it
before
your
betters
.
 
<EOS>
Your
intelligence
that
the
story
is
false
about
the
officers
forced
to
sell
,
is
admirable
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
see
them
all
three
here
every
day
,
no
more
in
the
army
than
you
.
 
<EOS>
Twelve
shillings
for
mending
the
strong
box
<EOS>
;
that
is
,
for
putting
a
farthing
's
worth
of
iron
on
a
hinge
,
and
gilding
it
;
give
him
six
shillings
,
and
I
'll
pay
it
,
and
never
employ
him
or
his
again
.
 
<EOS>
No
indeed
,
I
put
off
preaching
as
much
as
I
can
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
upon
another
foot
:
 
<EOS>
nobody
doubts
here
whether
I
can
preach
,
and
you
are
fools
.
  
<EOS>
The
account
you
give
of
that
weekly
paper
agrees
with
us
here
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Prior
was
like
to
be
insulted
in
the
street
for
being
supposed
the
author
of
it
;
but
one
of
the
last
papers
cleared
him
.
 
<EOS>
Nobody
knows
who
it
is
,
but
those
few
in
the
secret
,
I
suppose
the
Ministry
and
the
printer
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
Stella
's
eyes
!
 
<EOS>
God
bless
them
,
and
send
them
better
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
spare
them
,
and
write
not
above
two
lines
a
day
in
broad
daylight
.
 
<EOS>
How
does
Stella
look
,
Madam
Dingley
?
 
<EOS>
Pretty
well
,
a
handsome
young
woman
still
.
 
<EOS>
Will
she
pass
in
a
crowd
?
 
<EOS>
Will
she
make
a
figure
in
a
country
church
?
 
<EOS>
Stay
a
little
,
fair
ladies
.
 
<EOS>
I
this
minute
sent
Patrick
to
Sterne
:
 
<EOS>
he
brings
back
word
that
your
box
is
very
safe
with
one
Mr.
Earl
's
sister
in
Chester
,
and
that
Colonel
Edgworth
's
widow
goes
for
Ireland
on
Monday
next
,
and
will
receive
the
box
at
Chester
,
and
deliver
it
you
safe
:
 
<EOS>
so
there
are
some
hopes
now
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
let
us
go
on
to
your
letter
.
  
<EOS>
The
warrant
is
passed
for
the
First
-
Fruits
.
 
<EOS>
The
Queen
does
not
send
a
letter
;
but
a
patent
will
be
drawn
here
,
and
that
will
take
up
time
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Harley
of
late
has
said
nothing
of
presenting
me
to
the
Queen
:
 
<EOS>
I
was
overseen
when
I
mentioned
it
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
such
a
weight
of
affairs
on
him
,
that
he
can
not
mind
all
;
but
he
talked
of
it
three
or
four
times
to
me
,
long
before
I
dropped
it
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
What
,
is
not
Mrs.
Walls
"
business
over
yet
?
 
<EOS>
I
had
hopes
she
was
up
and
well
,
and
the
child
dead
before
this
time
.
 
<EOS>
You
did
right
,
at
last
,
to
send
me
your
accompts
;
but
I
did
not
stay
for
them
<EOS>
,
I
thank
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
you
have
your
bill
sent
in
my
last
,
and
there
will
be
eight
pounds
'
interest
soon
due
from
Hawkshaw
:
 
pray
look
at
his
bond
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
you
are
good
managers
;
and
that
,
when
I
say
so
,
Stella
wo
n't
think
I
intend
she
should
grudge
herself
wine
.
 
<EOS>
But
going
to
those
expensive
lodgings
requires
some
fund
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
you
had
stayed
till
I
came
over
,
for
some
reasons
.
 
<EOS>
That
Frenchwoman
will
be
grumbling
again
in
a
little
time
:
 
and
if
you
are
invited
anywhere
to
the
country
,
it
will
vex
you
to
pay
in
absence
;
and
the
country
may
be
necessary
for
poor
Stella
's
health
:
 
but
do
as
you
like
,
and
do
not
blame
Presto
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
but
you
are
telling
your
reasons
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
I
have
read
them
;
do
as
you
please
.
  
<EOS>
Yes
,
Raymond
says
he
must
stay
longer
than
he
thought
,
because
he
can
not
settle
his
affairs
.
 
<EOS>
M
#
#
#
#
is
in
the
country
at
some
friend
's
,
comes
to
town
in
spring
,
and
then
goes
to
settle
in
Herefordshire
.
 
<EOS>
Her
husband
is
a
surly
,
ill
-
natured
brute
,
and
cares
not
she
should
see
anybody
.
 
<EOS>
O
Lord
,
see
how
I
blundered
,
and
left
two
lines
short
;
it
was
that
ugly
score
in
the
paper
that
made
me
mistake
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
you
lie
about
the
story
of
the
fire
,
only
to
make
it
more
odd
.
 
<EOS>
Bernage
must
go
to
Spain
;
and
I
will
see
to
recommend
him
to
the
Duke
of
Argyle
,
his
General
,
when
I
see
the
Duke
next
:
 
but
the
officers
tell
me
it
would
be
dishonourable
in
the
last
degree
for
him
to
sell
now
,
and
he
would
never
be
preferred
in
the
army
;
so
that
,
unless
he
designs
to
leave
it
for
good
and
all
,
he
must
go
.
 
<EOS>
Tell
him
so
,
and
that
I
would
write
if
I
knew
where
to
direct
to
him
;
which
I
have
said
fourscore
times
already
.
<EOS>
I
had
rather
anything
almost
than
that
you
should
strain
yourselves
to
send
a
letter
when
it
is
inconvenient
;
we
have
settled
that
matter
already
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
write
when
I
can
,
and
so
shall
MD
;
and
upon
occasions
extraordinary
I
will
write
,
though
it
be
a
line
;
and
<EOS>
when
we
have
not
letters
soon
,
we
agree
that
all
things
are
well
;
and
so
that
's
settled
for
ever
,
and
so
hold
your
tongue
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
you
shall
have
your
pins
;
but
for
candles
'
ends
,
I
can
not
promise
,
because
I
burn
them
to
the
stumps
;
besides
,
I
remember
what
Stella
told
Dingley
about
them
many
years
ago
,
and
she
may
think
the
same
thing
of
me
.
  
<EOS>
And
Dingley
shall
have
her
hinged
spectacles
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
dear
Stella
,
how
durst
you
write
those
two
lines
by
candlelight
?
<EOS>
bang
your
bones
!
 
<EOS>
Faith
,
this
letter
shall
go
to
-
morrow
,
I
think
,
and
that
will
be
in
ten
days
from
the
last
,
young
women
;
that
's
too
soon
of
all
conscience
:
 
but
answering
yours
has
filled
it
up
so
quick
,
and
I
do
not
design
to
use
you
to
three
pages
in
folio
,
no
,
nooooh
.
 
<EOS>
All
this
is
one
morning
's
work
in
bed
;
 
and
so
good
-
morrow
,
little
sirrahs
;
that
's
for
the
rhyme
.
 
<EOS>
You
want
politics
:
 
<EOS>
faith
,
I
ca
n't
think
of
any
;
but
may
be
at
night
<EOS>
I
may
tell
you
a
passage
.
 
<EOS>
Come
,
sit
off
the
bed
,
and
let
me
rise
,
will
you
?
 
<EOS>
At
night
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
to
-
day
with
my
neighbour
Vanhomrigh
;
it
was
such
dismal
weather
<EOS>
I
could
not
stir
further
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
had
some
threatenings
with
my
head
,
but
no
fits
.
 
<EOS>
I
still
drink
Dr.
Radcliffe
's
bitter
,
and
will
continue
it
.
  
<EOS>
10
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
this
morning
to
see
the
Secretary
of
State
,
and
have
engaged
him
to
give
a
memorial
from
me
to
the
Duke
of
Argyle
in
behalf
of
Bernage
.
 
<EOS>
The
Duke
is
a
man
that
distinguishes
people
of
merit
,
and
I
will
speak
to
him
myself
;
but
the
Secretary
backing
it
will
be
very
effectual
,
and
I
will
take
care
to
have
it
done
to
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
tell
Bernage
so
,
and
that
I
think
nothing
can
be
luckier
for
him
,
and
that
I
would
have
him
go
by
all
means
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
order
it
that
the
Duke
shall
send
for
him
when
they
are
in
Spain
;
or
,
if
he
fails
,
that
he
shall
receive
him
kindly
when
he
goes
to
wait
on
him
.
 
<EOS>
Can
I
do
more
?
<EOS>
Is
not
this
a
great
deal
?
 
<EOS>
I
now
send
away
this
letter
,
that
you
may
not
stay
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
with
Ford
upon
his
Opera
-
day
,
and
am
now
come
home
,
and
am
going
to
study
;
do
not
you
presume
to
guess
,
sirrahs
,
impudent
saucy
dear
boxes
.
 
<EOS>
Towards
the
end
of
a
letter
I
could
not
say
saucy
boxes
without
putting
dear
between
.
 
<EOS>
An't
<EOS>
that
right
now
?
 
<EOS>
Farewell
.
 
<EOS>
THIS
should
BE
longer
,
BUT
that
I
send
IT
to
-
night
.
  
<EOS>
O
silly
,
silly
loggerhead
!
  
<EOS>
I
send
a
letter
this
post
to
one
Mr.
Staunton
,
and
I
direct
it
to
Mr.
Acton
's
in
St.
Michael
's
Lane
.
 
<EOS>
He
formerly
lodged
there
,
but
he
has
not
told
me
where
to
direct
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
send
to
that
Acton
,
whether
the
letter
is
come
there
,
and
whether
he
has
sent
it
to
Staunton
.
  
<EOS>
If
Bernage
designs
to
sell
his
commission
and
stay
at
home
,
pray
let
him
tell
me
so
,
that
my
recommendation
to
the
Duke
of
Argyle
may
not
be
in
vain
.

LETTER

.
 
<EOS>
LONDON
,
Feb.
10
,
1710
-
11
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
just
despatched
my
fifteenth
to
the
post
;
I
tell
you
how
things
will
be
,
after
I
have
got
a
letter
from
MD
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
in
furious
haste
to
finish
mine
,
for
fear
of
having
two
of
MD
's
to
answer
in
one
of
Presto
's
,
which
would
be
such
a
disgrace
<EOS>
,
never
saw
the
like
;
but
,
<EOS>
before
you
write
to
me
,
I
write
at
my
leisure
,
like
a
gentleman
,
a
little
every
day
,
just
to
let
you
know
how
matters
go
,
and
so
and
so
;
and
I
hope
before
this
comes
to
you
,
you
'll
have
got
your
box
and
chocolate
,
and
Presto
will
take
more
care
another
time
.
  
<EOS>
11
.
 
<EOS>
Morning
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
rise
and
go
see
my
Lord
Keeper
,
which
will
cost
me
two
shillings
in
coach
-
hire
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
call
them
two
thirteens
?
 
<EOS>
A
t
night
.
<EOS>
It
has
rained
all
day
,
and
there
was
no
walking
.
 
<EOS>
I
read
prayers
to
Sir
Andrew
Fountaine
in
the
forenoon
,
and
I
dined
with
three
Irishmen
,
at
one
Mr.
Cope
's
lodgings
;
the
other
two
were
one
Morris
an
archdeacon
,
and
Mr.
Ford
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
came
home
this
evening
,
I
expected
that
little
jackanapes
Harrison
would
have
come
to
get
help
about
his
Tatler
for
Tuesday
:
 
<EOS>
I
have
fixed
two
evenings
in
the
week
which
I
allow
him
to
come
.
 
<EOS>
The
toad
never
came
,
and
I
expecting
him
fell
a
reading
,
and
left
off
other
business
.
 
<EOS>
Come
,
what
are
you
doing
?
 
<EOS>
How
do
you
pass
your
time
this
ugly
weather
?
 
<EOS>
Gaming
and
drinking
<EOS>
,
I
suppose
:
 
fine
diversions
for
young
ladies
,
truly
!
 
<EOS>
I
wish
you
had
some
of
our
Seville
oranges
,
and
we
some
of
your
wine
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
the
finest
oranges
for
twopence
apiece
,
and
the
basest
wine
for
six
shillings
a
bottle
.
<EOS>
They
tell
me
wine
grows
cheap
with
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
resolved
to
have
half
a
hogshead
when
I
get
to
Ireland
,
if
it
be
good
and
cheap
,
as
it
used
to
be
;
and
I
will
treat
MD
at
my
table
in
an
evening
,
oh
hoa
,
and
laugh
at
great
Ministers
of
State
.
  
<EOS>
12
.
 
<EOS>
The
days
are
grown
fine
and
long
,
 
be
thanked
.
 
<EOS>
O
,
faith
<EOS>
,
you
forget
all
our
little
sayings
,
and
I
am
angry
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
to
-
day
with
Mr.
Secretary
St.
John
:
 
<EOS>
I
went
to
the
Court
of
Requests
at
noon
,
and
sent
Mr.
Harley
into
the
House
to
call
the
Secretary
,
to
let
him
know
I
would
not
dine
with
him
if
he
dined
late
.
 
<EOS>
By
good
luck
the
Duke
of
Argyle
was
at
the
lobby
of
the
House
too
,
and
I
kept
him
in
talk
till
the
Secretary
came
out
;
then
told
them
I
was
glad
to
meet
them
together
,
and
that
I
had
a
request
to
the
Duke
,
which
the
Secretary
must
second
,
and
his
Grace
must
grant
.
 
<EOS>
The
Duke
said
he
was
sure
it
was
something
insignificant
,
and
wished
it
was
ten
times
greater
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
Secretary
's
house
I
writ
a
memorial
,
and
gave
it
to
the
Secretary
to
give
the
Duke
,
and
shall
see
that
he
does
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
,
that
his
Grace
will
please
to
take
Mr.
Bernage
into
his
protection
;
and
if
he
finds
Bernage
answers
my
character
,
to
give
him
all
encouragement
.
 
<EOS>
Colonel
Masham
and
Colonel
Hill
<EOS>
(
Mrs.
Masham
's
brother
tell
me
my
request
is
reasonable
,
and
they
will
second
it
heartily
to
the
Duke
too
:
 
<EOS>
so
I
reckon
<EOS>
Bernage
is
on
a
very
good
foot
when
he
goes
to
Spain
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
tell
him
this
,
though
perhaps
I
will
write
to
him
before
he
goes
;
yet
where
shall
I
direct
?
<EOS>
for
I
suppose
he
has
left
Connolly
's
.
  
<EOS>
13
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
left
off
Lady
Kerry
's
bitter
,
and
got
another
box
of
pills
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
fits
of
giddiness
,
but
only
some
little
disorders
towards
it
;
and
I
walk
as
much
as
I
can
.
 
<EOS>
Lady
Kerry
is
just
as
I
am
,
only
a
great
deal
worse
:
I
dined
to
-
day
at
Lord
Shelburne
's
,
where
she
is
,
and
we
con
ailments
,
which
makes
us
very
fond
of
each
other
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
taken
Mr.
Harley
into
favour
again
,
and
called
to
see
him
,
but
he
was
not
within
;
I
will
use
to
visit
him
after
dinner
,
for
he
dines
too
late
for
my
head
:
 
<EOS>
then
I
went
to
visit
poor
Congreve
,
who
is
just
getting
out
of
a
severe
fit
of
the
gout
;
and
I
sat
with
him
till
near
nine
o'clock
.
 
<EOS>
He
gave
me
a
Tatler
he
had
written
out
,
as
blind
as
he
is
,
for
little
Harrison
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
about
a
scoundrel
that
was
grown
rich
,
and
went
and
bought
a
coat
of
arms
at
the
Herald
's
,
and
a
set
of
ancestors
at
Fleet
Ditch
;
'
tis
well
enough
,
and
shall
be
printed
in
two
or
three
days
,
and
if
you
read
those
kind
of
things
,
this
will
divert
you
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
now
between
ten
and
eleven
,
and
I
am
going
to
bed
.
  
<EOS>
14
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
Mrs.
Vanhomrigh
's
daughter
's
birthday
,
and
Mr.
Ford
and
I
were
invited
to
dinner
to
keep
it
,
and
we
spent
the
evening
there
,
drinking
punch
.
 
<EOS>
That
was
our
way
of
beginning
Lent
;
and
in
the
morning
Lord
Shelburne
,
Lady
Kerry
,
Mrs.
Pratt
,
and
I
,
went
to
Hyde
Park
,
instead
of
going
to
church
;
for
,
till
my
head
is
a
little
settled
,
I
think
it
better
not
to
go
;
it
would
be
so
silly
and
troublesome
to
go
out
sick
.
 
<EOS>
Dr.
Duke
died
suddenly
two
or
three
nights
ago
;
he
was
one
of
the
wits
when
we
were
children
,
but
turned
parson
,
and
left
it
,
and
never
writ
farther
than
a
prologue
or
recommendatory
copy
of
verses
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
a
fine
living
given
him
by
the
Bishop
of
Winchester
about
three
months
ago
;
he
got
his
living
suddenly
,
and
he
got
his
dying
so
too
.
  
<EOS>
15
.
 
<EOS>
I
walked
purely
to
-
day
about
the
Park
<EOS>
,
the
rain
being
just
over
,
of
which
we
have
had
a
great
deal
,
mixed
with
little
short
frosts
.
 
<EOS>
I
went
to
the
Court
of
Requests
,
thinking
,
if
Mr.
Harley
dined
early
,
to
go
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
But
meeting
Leigh
and
Sterne
,
they
invited
me
to
dine
with
them
,
and
away
we
went
.
 
<EOS>
When
we
got
into
his
room
,
one
H
#
#
#
#
,
a
worthless
Irish
fellow
,
was
there
,
ready
to
dine
with
us
;
so
I
stepped
out
,
and
whispered
them
,
that
I
would
not
dine
with
that
fellow
:
 
they
made
excuses
,
and
begged
me
to
stay
;
but
away
I
went
to
Mr.
Harley
's
,
and
he
did
not
dine
at
home
;
and
at
last
I
dined
at
Sir
John
Germaine
's
,
and
found
Lady
Betty
but
just
recovered
of
a
miscarriage
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
writing
an
inscription
for
Lord
Berkeley
's
tomb
;
you
know
the
young
rake
his
son
,
the
new
Earl
,
is
married
to
the
Duke
of
Richmond
's
daughter
,
at
the
Duke
's
country
house
,
and
are
now
coming
to
town
.
 
<EOS>
She
will
be
fluxed
in
two
months
,
and
they
'll
be
parted
in
a
year
.
 
<EOS>
You
ladies
are
brave
,
bold
,
venturesome
folks
;
and
the
chit
is
but
seventeen
,
and
is
ill
-
natured
,
covetous
,
vicious
,
and
proud
in
extremes
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
get
you
gone
to
Stoyte
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
16
.
 
<EOS>
Faith
,
this
letter
goes
on
but
slow
;
'
tis
a
week
old
,
and
the
first
side
not
written
.
 
<EOS>
I
went
to
-
day
into
the
City
for
a
walk
,
but
the
person
I
designed
to
dine
with
was
not
at
home
;
so
I
came
back
,
and
called
at
Congreve
's
,
and
dined
with
him
and
Estcourt
,
and
laughed
till
six
<EOS>
;
then
went
to
Mr.
Harley
's
,
who
was
not
gone
to
dinner
;
there
I
stayed
till
nine
,
and
we
made
up
our
quarrel
,
and
he
has
invited
me
to
dinner
to
-
morrow
,
which
is
the
day
of
the
week
(
Saturday
)
that
Lord
Keeper
and
Secretary
St.
John
dine
with
him
privately
,
and
at
last
they
have
consented
to
let
me
among
them
on
that
day
.
 
<EOS>
Atterbury
and
Prior
went
to
bury
poor
Dr.
Duke
.
 
<EOS>
Congreve
's
nasty
white
wine
has
given
me
the
heart
-
burn
.
  
<EOS>
17
.
 
<EOS>
I
took
some
good
walks
in
the
Park
to
-
day
,
and
then
went
to
Mr.
Harley
.
<EOS>
Lord
Rivers
was
got
there
before
me
,
and
I
chid
him
for
presuming
to
come
on
a
day
when
only
Lord
Keeper
and
the
Secretary
<EOS>
and
I
were
to
be
there
;
but
he
regarded
me
not
;
so
we
all
dined
together
,
and
sat
down
at
four
;
and
the
Secretary
has
invited
me
to
dine
with
him
to
-
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
I
told
them
I
had
no
hopes
they
could
ever
keep
in
,
but
that
I
saw
they
loved
one
another
<EOS>
so
well
,
as
indeed
they
seem
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
They
call
me
nothing
but
Jonathan
;
and
I
said
I
believed
they
would
leave
me
Jonathan
as
they
found
me
;
and
that
I
never
knew
a
Ministry
do
anything
for
those
whom
they
make
companions
of
their
pleasures
;
and
I
believe
you
will
find
it
so
<EOS>
;
but
I
care
not
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
upon
a
project
of
getting
five
hundred
pounds
,
without
being
obliged
to
anybody
;
but
that
is
a
secret
,
till
I
see
my
dearest
MD
;
and
so
hold
your
tongue
,
and
do
not
talk
,
sirrahs
,
for
I
am
now
about
it
.
  
<EOS>
18
.
 
<EOS>
My
head
has
no
fits
,
but
a
little
disordered
before
dinner
;
yet
I
walk
stoutly
,
and
take
pills
,
and
hope
to
mend
.
 
<EOS>
Secretary
St.
John
would
needs
have
me
dine
with
him
to
-
day
;
and
there
I
found
three
persons
I
never
saw
,
two
I
had
no
acquaintance
with
,
and
one
I
did
not
care
for
:
 
<EOS>
so
I
left
them
early
and
came
home
,
it
being
no
day
to
walk
,
but
scurvy
rain
and
wind
.
 
<EOS>
The
Secretary
tells
me
he
has
put
a
cheat
on
me
;
for
Lord
Peterborow
sent
him
twelve
dozen
flasks
of
burgundy
,
on
condition
that
I
should
have
my
share
;
but
he
never
was
quiet
till
they
were
all
gone
,
so
I
reckon
he
owes
me
thirty
-
six
pounds
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Peterborow
is
now
got
to
Vienna
,
and
I
must
write
to
him
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
I
begin
now
to
be
towards
looking
for
a
letter
from
some
certain
ladies
of
Presto
's
acquaintance
,
that
live
at
St.
Mary
's
,
and
are
called
in
a
certain
language
,
our
little
MD
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
stay
,
I
do
n't
expect
one
these
six
days
,
that
will
be
just
three
weeks
;
an't
I
<EOS>
a
reasonable
creature
?
 
<EOS>
We
are
plagued
here
with
an
October
Club
,
that
is
,
a
set
of
above
a
hundred
Parliament
men
of
the
country
,
who
drink
October
beer
at
home
,
and
meet
every
evening
at
a
tavern
near
the
Parliament
to
consult
affairs
,
and
drive
things
on
to
extremes
against
the
Whigs
,
to
call
the
old
Ministry
to
account
,
and
get
off
five
or
six
heads
.
 
<EOS>
The
Ministry
seem
not
to
regard
them
;
yet
one
of
them
in
confidence
told
me
that
there
must
be
something
thought
on
,
to
settle
things
better
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
tell
you
one
great
State
secret
:
 
the
Queen
,
sensible
how
much
she
was
governed
by
the
late
Ministry
,
runs
a
little
into
t'other
extreme
,
and
is
jealous
in
that
point
,
even
of
those
who
got
her
out
of
the
others
'
hands
.
 
<EOS>
The
Ministry
is
for
gentler
measures
,
and
the
other
Tories
for
more
violent
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Rivers
,
talking
to
me
the
other
day
,
cursed
the
paper
called
the
Examiner
,
for
speaking
civilly
of
the
Duke
of
Marlborough
;
this
I
happened
to
talk
of
to
the
Secretary
,
who
blamed
the
warmth
of
that
lord
and
some
others
,
and
swore
that
if
their
advice
were
followed
they
would
be
blown
up
in
twenty
-
four
hours
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
have
reason
to
think
that
they
will
endeavour
to
prevail
on
the
Queen
to
put
her
affairs
more
in
the
hands
of
a
Ministry
than
she
does
at
present
;
and
there
are
,
I
believe
,
two
men
thought
on
,
one
of
them
you
have
often
met
the
name
of
in
my
letters
.
 
<EOS>
But
so
much
for
politics
.
  
<EOS>
19
.
 
<EOS>
This
proved
a
terrible
rainy
day
,
which
prevented
my
walk
into
the
City
,
and
I
was
only
able
to
run
and
dine
with
my
neighbour
Vanhomrigh
,
where
Sir
Andrew
Fountaine
dined
too
,
who
has
just
began
to
sally
out
,
and
has
shipped
his
mother
and
sister
,
who
were
his
nurses
,
back
to
the
country
.
 
<EOS>
This
evening
was
fair
,
and
I
walked
a
little
in
the
Park
,
till
Prior
made
me
go
with
him
to
the
Smyrna
Coffee
-
house
,
where
I
sat
a
while
,
and
saw
four
or
five
Irish
persons
,
who
are
very
handsome
,
genteel
fellows
;
but
I
know
not
their
names
.
<EOS>
I
came
away
at
seven
,
and
got
home
.
 
<EOS>
Two
days
ago
I
writ
to
Bernage
,
and
told
him
what
I
had
done
,
and
directed
the
letter
to
Mr.
Curry
's
,
to
be
left
with
Dingley
.
 
<EOS>
Brigadiers
Hill
and
Masham
,
brother
and
husband
to
Mrs.
Masham
,
the
Queen
's
favourite
,
Colonel
Disney
,
and
I
,
have
recommended
Bernage
to
the
Duke
of
Argyle
;
and
Secretary
St.
John
has
given
the
Duke
my
memorial
;
and
,
besides
,
Hill
tells
me
,
that
Bernage
's
colonel
,
Fielding
,
designs
to
make
him
his
captain
-
lieutenant
:
 
<EOS>
but
I
believe
I
said
this
to
you
before
,
<EOS>
and
in
this
letter
;
but
I
will
not
look
.
  
<EOS>
20
.
 
<EOS>
Morning
.
 
<EOS>
It
snows
terribly
again
;
and
'
tis
mistaken
,
for
I
now
want
a
little
good
weather
.
 
<EOS>
I
bid
you
good
-
morrow
;
and
,
if
it
clear
up
,
get
you
gone
to
poor
Mrs.
Walls
,
who
has
had
a
hard
time
of
it
,
but
is
now
pretty
well
again
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
sorry
it
is
a
girl
:
 
the
poor
Archdeacon
too
<EOS>
,
see
how
simply
he
looked
when
they
told
him
:
 
what
did
it
cost
Stella
to
be
gossip
?
 
<EOS>
I
'll
rise
;
so
,
<EOS>
d'ye
hear
,
let
me
see
you
at
night
;
and
do
not
stay
late
out
,
and
catch
cold
,
sirrahs
.
 
<EOS>
At
night
.
 
<EOS>
It
grew
good
weather
,
and
I
got
a
good
walk
,
and
dined
with
Ford
upon
his
Opera
-
day
;
but
,
now
all
his
wine
is
gone
,
I
shall
dine
with
him
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
to
send
this
letter
before
I
hear
from
MD
,
methinks
there
is
 
something
great
in
doing
so
,
only
I
ca
n't
express
where
it
lies
;
and
,
faith
<EOS>
,
this
shall
go
by
Saturday
,
as
sure
as
you
're
a
rogue
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Edgworth
was
to
set
out
but
last
Monday
;
so
you
wo
n't
have
your
box
so
soon
perhaps
as
this
letter
;
but
Sterne
told
me
since
that
it
is
safe
at
Chester
,
and
that
she
will
take
care
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
'd
give
a
guinea
<EOS>
you
had
it
.
  
<EOS>
21
.
 
<EOS>
Morning
.
 
<EOS>
Faith
,
I
hope
it
will
be
fair
for
me
to
walk
into
the
City
;
for
I
take
all
occasions
of
walking
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
be
plaguy
busy
at
Laracor
if
I
were
there
now
,
cutting
down
willows
,
planting
others
,
scouring
my
canal
,
and
every
kind
of
thing
.
 
<EOS>
If
Raymond
goes
over
this
summer
,
you
must
submit
,
and
make
them
a
visit
,
that
we
may
have
another
eel
and
trout
fishing
;
and
that
Stella
may
ride
by
,
and
see
Presto
in
his
morning
-
gown
in
the
garden
,
and
so
go
up
with
Joe
to
the
Hill
of
Bree
,
and
round
by
Scurlock
's
Town
.
 
<EOS>
O
Lord
,
how
I
remember
names
!
<EOS>
faith
,
it
gives
me
short
sighs
;
therefore
no
more
of
that
,
if
you
love
me
.
 
<EOS>
Good
-
morrow
,
I
will
go
rise
like
a
gentleman
;
my
pills
say
I
must
.
 
<EOS>
At
night
.
 
<EOS>
Lady
Kerry
sent
to
desire
me
to
engage
some
lords
about
an
affair
she
has
in
their
house
here
:
 
<EOS>
I
called
to
see
her
,
but
found
she
had
already
engaged
every
lord
I
knew
,
and
that
there
was
no
great
difficulty
in
the
matter
;
and
it
rained
like
a
dog
;
so
I
took
coach
,
for
want
of
better
exercise
,
and
dined
privately
with
a
hang
-
dog
in
the
City
,
and
walked
back
in
the
evening
.
 
<EOS>
The
days
are
now
long
enough
to
walk
in
the
Park
after
dinner
;
and
so
I
do
whenever
it
is
fair
.
 
<EOS>
This
walking
is
a
strange
remedy
:
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Prior
walks
,
to
make
himself
fat
,
and
I
to
bring
myself
down
;
he
has
generally
a
cough
,
which
he
only
calls
a
cold
;
we
often
walk
round
the
Park
together
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
'll
go
sleep
.
  
<EOS>
22
.
 
<EOS>
It
snowed
all
this
morning
prodigiously
,
and
was
some
inches
thick
in
three
or
four
hours
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
with
Mr.
Lewis
of
the
Secretary
's
office
at
his
lodgings
:
 
<EOS>
the
chairmen
that
carried
me
squeezed
a
great
fellow
against
a
wall
,
who
wisely
turned
his
back
,
and
broke
one
of
the
side
-
glasses
in
a
thousand
pieces
.
 
<EOS>
I
fell
a
scolding
,
pretended
<EOS>
I
was
like
to
be
cut
to
pieces
,
and
made
them
set
down
the
chair
in
the
Park
,
while
they
picked
out
the
bits
of
glasses
;
and
,
when
I
paid
them
,
I
quarrelled
still
;
so
they
dared
not
grumble
,
and
I
came
off
for
my
fare
;
but
I
was
plaguily
afraid
they
would
have
said
,
"
God
bless
your
honour
,
wo
n't
you
give
us
something
for
our
glass
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Lewis
and
I
were
forming
a
project
how
I
might
get
three
or
four
hundred
pounds
,
which
I
suppose
may
come
to
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
Smyth
has
brought
you
your
palsy
-
drops
.
 
<EOS>
How
does
Stella
do
?
 
<EOS>
I
begin
more
and
more
to
desire
to
know
.
 
<EOS>
The
three
weeks
since
I
had
your
last
is
over
within
two
days
,
and
I
will
allow
three
for
accidents
.
  
<EOS>
23
.
 
<EOS>
The
snow
is
gone
every
bit
,
except
the
remainder
of
some
great
balls
made
by
the
boys
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Sterne
was
with
me
this
morning
about
an
affair
he
has
before
the
Treasury
.
 
<EOS>
That
drab
Mrs.
Edgworth
is
not
yet
set
out
,
but
will
infallibly
next
Monday
:
 
and
this
is
the
third
infallible
Monday
,
and
pox
take
her
!
 
<EOS>
So
you
will
have
this
letter
first
;
and
this
shall
go
to
-
morrow
;
and
,
if
I
have
one
from
MD
in
that
time
,
I
will
not
answer
it
till
my
next
;
only
I
will
say
,
"
Madam
,
I
received
your
letter
,
and
so
,
and
so
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
dined
to
-
day
with
my
Mistress
Butler
,
who
grows
very
disagreeable
.
  
<EOS>
24
.
 
<EOS>
Morning
.
 
<EOS>
This
letter
certainly
goes
this
evening
,
sure
as
you
're
alive
,
young
women
,
and
then
you
will
be
so
shamed
that
I
have
had
none
from
you
;
and
,
if
I
was
to
reckon
like
you
<EOS>
,
I
would
say
,
I
were
six
letters
before
you
,
for
this
is
N.16
,
and
I
have
had
your
N.10
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
reckon
you
have
received
but
fourteen
,
and
have
sent
eleven
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
to
go
to
-
day
a
Minister
-
of
-
State-
hunting
in
the
Court
of
Requests
;
for
I
have
something
to
say
to
Mr.
Harley
.
<EOS>
And
it
is
fine
,
cold
,
sunshiny
weather
;
I
wish
dear
MD
would
walk
this
morning
in
your
Stephen
's
Green
;
'
tis
as
good
as
our
Park
,
but
not
so
large
.
<EOS>
Faith
,
this
summer
we
'll
take
a
coach
for
sixpence
to
the
Green
Well
,
the
two
walks
,
and
thence
all
the
way
to
Stoyte
's
.
 
<EOS>
My
hearty
service
to
Goody
Stoyte
and
Catherine
;
and
<EOS>
I
hope
Mrs.
Walls
had
a
good
time
.
 
<EOS>
How
inconstant
I
am
!
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
imagine
I
was
ever
in
love
with
her
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
I
'm
going
;
what
have
you
to
say
?
 
<EOS>
I
DO
NOT
CARE
<EOS>
HOW
<EOS>
I
WRITE
NOW
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
design
to
write
on
this
side
;
these
few
lines
are
but
so
much
more
than
your
due
;
so
I
will
write
LARGE
or
small
as
I
please
.
 
<EOS>
O
,
faith
,
my
hands
are
starving
in
bed
;
I
believe
it
is
a
hard
frost
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
rise
,
and
bid
you
good
-
bye
,
for
I
'll
seal
this
letter
immediately
,
and
carry
it
in
my
pocket
,
and
put
it
into
the
post
-
office
with
my
own
fair
hands
.
 
<EOS>
Farewell
.
  
<EOS>
This
letter
is
just
a
fortnight
's
journal
to
-
day
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
and
so
it
is
,
I
'm
sure
,
says
you
,
with
your
two
eggs
a
penny
.
  
<EOS>
Lele
,
lele
,
lele

<EOS>
O
Lord
,
I
am
saying
lele
,
lele
,
to
myself
,
in
all
our
little
keys
:
 
and
,
now
you
talk
of
keys
,
that
dog
Patrick
broke
the
key
-
general
of
the
chest
of
drawers
with
six
locks
,
and
I
have
been
so
plagued
to
get
a
new
one
,
besides
my
good
two
shillings
!

LETTER
17
.
 
<EOS>
LONDON
,
Feb.
24
,
1710
-
11
.
  
<EOS>
Now
,
young
women
,
I
gave
in
my
sixteenth
this
evening
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
with
Ford
<EOS>
(
it
was
his
Opera
-
day
)
<EOS>
as
usual
;
it
is
very
convenient
to
me
to
do
so
,
for
coming
home
early
after
a
walk
in
the
Park
,
which
now
the
days
will
allow
.
 
<EOS>
I
called
on
the
Secretary
at
his
office
,
and
he
had
forgot
to
give
the
memorial
about
Bernage
to
the
Duke
of
Argyle
;
but
,
two
days
ago
,
I
met
the
Duke
,
who
desired
I
would
give
it
him
myself
,
which
should
have
more
power
with
him
than
all
the
Ministry
together
,
as
he
protested
solemnly
,
repeated
it
two
or
three
times
,
and
bid
me
count
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
So
that
I
verily
believe
Bernage
will
be
in
a
very
good
way
to
establish
himself
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
can
do
no
more
for
him
at
present
,
and
there
's
an
end
of
that
;
and
so
get
you
gone
to
bed
,
<EOS>
for
it
is
late
.
  
<EOS>
25
.
 
<EOS>
The
three
weeks
are
out
yesterday
since
I
had
your
last
,
and
so
now
I
will
be
expecting
every
day
a
pretty
dear
letter
from
my
own
MD
,
and
hope
to
hear
that
Stella
has
been
much
better
in
her
head
and
eyes
:
 
<EOS>
my
head
continues
as
it
was
,
no
fits
,
but
a
little
disorder
every
day
,
which
I
can
easily
bear
,
if
it
will
not
grow
worse
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
to
-
day
with
Mr.
Secretary
St.
John
,
<EOS>
on
condition
I
might
choose
my
company
,
which
were
Lord
Rivers
,
Lord
Carteret
,
Sir
Thomas
Mansel
,
and
Mr.
Lewis
;
I
invited
Masham
,
Hill
,
Sir
John
Stanley
,
and
George
Granville
,
but
they
were
engaged
;
and
I
did
it
in
revenge
of
his
having
such
bad
company
when
I
dined
with
him
before
;
so
we
laughed
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
ventured
to
go
to
church
to
-
day
,
which
I
have
not
done
this
month
before
.
<EOS>
Can
you
send
me
such
a
good
account
of
Stella
's
health
,
pray
now
?
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
I
hope
,
and
better
too
.
 
<EOS>
We
dined
(
says
you
)
at
the
Dean
's
,
and
played
at
cards
till
twelve
,
and
there
came
in
Mr.
French
,
and
Dr.
Travors
,
and
Dr.
Whittingham
,
and
Mr.
<EOS>
(
I
forget
his
name
,
that
I
always
tell
Mrs.
Walls
of
)
the
banker
's
son
,
a
pox
on
him
.
 
<EOS>
And
we
were
so
merry
;
<EOS>
I
vow
they
are
pure
good
company
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
lost
a
crown
;
for
you
must
know
I
had
always
hands
tempting
me
to
go
out
,
but
never
took
in
anything
,
and
often
two
black
aces
without
a
manilio
;
was
not
that
hard
,
Presto
?
 
<EOS>
Hold
your
tongue
,
etc
.
  
<EOS>
26
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
this
morning
with
Mr.
Secretary
about
some
business
,
and
he
tells
me
that
Colonel
Fielding
is
now
going
to
make
Bernage
his
captain
-
lieutenant
,
that
is
,
a
captain
by
commission
,
and
the
perquisites
of
the
company
;
but
not
captain
's
pay
,
only
the
first
step
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
he
will
like
it
;
and
the
recommendation
to
the
Duke
of
Argyle
goes
on
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
trouble
me
no
more
about
your
Bernage
;
the
jackanapes
understands
what
fair
solicitors
he
has
got
,
I
warrant
you
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
Andrew
Fountaine
and
I
dined
,
by
invitation
,
with
Mrs.
Vanhomrigh
.
 
<EOS>
You
say
they
are
of
no
consequence
:
 
<EOS>
why
,
they
keep
as
good
female
company
as
I
do
male
;
I
see
all
the
drabs
of
quality
at
this
end
of
the
town
with
them
:
 
<EOS>
I
saw
two
Lady
Bettys
there
this
afternoon
;
the
beauty
of
one
,
the
good
-
breeding
and
nature
of
t'other
,
and
the
wit
of
neither
,
would
have
made
a
fine
woman
.
 
<EOS>
Rare
walking
in
the
Park
now
:
 
<EOS>
why
do
n't
you
walk
in
the
Green
of
St.
Stephen
?
 
<EOS>
The
walks
there
are
finer
gravelled
than
the
Mall
.
<EOS>
What
beasts
the
Irish
women
are
,
never
to
walk
!
  
<EOS>
27
.
 
<EOS>
Darteneuf
and
I
,
and
little
Harrison
<EOS>
the
new
Tatler
,
and
Jervas
the
painter
,
dined
to
-
day
with
James
,
I
know
not
his
other
name
,
but
it
is
one
of
Darteneuf
's
dining
-
places
,
who
is
a
true
epicure
.
 
<EOS>
James
is
clerk
of
the
kitchen
to
the
Queen
,
and
has
a
little
snug
house
at
St.
James
's
;
and
we
had
the
Queen
's
wine
,
and
such
very
fine
victuals
that
I
could
not
eat
it
.
 
<EOS>
Three
weeks
and
three
days
since
my
last
letter
from
MD
;
rare
doings
!
<EOS>
why
,
truly
we
were
so
busy
with
poor
Mrs.
Walls
,
that
indeed
,
Presto
,
we
could
not
write
<EOS>
,
we
were
afraid
the
poor
woman
would
have
died
;
and
it
pitied
us
to
see
the
Archdeacon
,
how
concerned
he
was
.
 
<EOS>
The
Dean
never
came
to
see
her
<EOS>
but
once
;
but
now
she
is
up
again
,
and
we
go
and
sit
with
her
in
the
evenings
.
 
<EOS>
The
child
died
the
next
day
after
it
was
born
;
and
I
believe
,
between
friends
,
she
is
not
very
sorry
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
Presto
,
you
are
plaguy
silly
tonight
,
and
han't
guessed
one
word
right
;
for
she
and
the
child
are
both
well
,
and
it
is
a
fine
girl
,
likely
to
live
;
and
the
Dean
was
godfather
,
and
Mrs.
Catherine
and
I
were
godmothers
;
I
was
going
to
say
Stoyte
,
but
I
think
I
have
heard
they
do
n't
put
maids
and
married
women
together
;
<EOS>
though
I
know
not
why
I
think
so
,
nor
I
do
n't
care
;
what
care
I
?
<EOS>
but
I
must
prate
,
etc
.
  
<EOS>
28
.
 
<EOS>
I
walked
to
-
day
into
the
City
for
my
health
,
and
there
dined
;
which
I
always
do
when
the
weather
is
fair
,
and
business
permits
<EOS>
,
that
I
may
be
under
a
necessity
of
taking
a
good
walk
,
which
is
the
best
thing
I
can
do
at
present
for
my
health
.
 
<EOS>
Some
bookseller
has
raked
up
everything
I
writ
,
and
published
it
t'other
day
in
one
volume
;
but
I
know
nothing
of
it
,
'
twas
without
my
knowledge
or
consent
:
 
<EOS>
it
makes
a
four
-
shilling
book
,
and
is
called
Miscellanies
in
Prose
and
Verse
.
 
<EOS>
Tooke
pretends
<EOS>
he
knows
nothing
of
it
;
but
I
doubt
he
is
at
the
bottom
.
 
<EOS>
One
must
have
patience
with
these
things
;
the
best
of
it
is
,
I
shall
be
plagued
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
I
will
bring
a
couple
of
them
over
with
me
for
MD
;
perhaps
you
may
desire
to
see
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
hear
they
sell
mightily
.

March

.
 
<EOS>
Morning
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
calling
to
Patrick
to
look
in
his
almanac
for
the
day
of
the
month
;
I
did
not
know
<EOS>
but
it
might
be
leap
-
year
.
 
<EOS>
The
almanac
says
'
tis
the
third
after
leap
-
year
;
and
I
always
thought
till
now
,
that
every
third
year
was
leap
-
year
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
glad
they
come
so
seldom
;
but
I
'm
sure
<EOS>
'
twas
otherwise
when
I
was
a
young
man
<EOS>
;
I
see
times
are
mightily
changed
since
then
.
 
<EOS>
Write
to
me
,
sirrahs
<EOS>
;
be
sure
do
by
the
time
this
side
is
done
,
and
I
'll
keep
t'other
side
for
the
answer
:
 
<EOS>
so
I
'll
go
write
to
the
Bishop
of
Clogher
;
good
-
morrow
,
sirrahs
.
 
<EOS>
Night
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
to
-
day
at
Mrs.
Vanhomrigh
's
,
being
a
rainy
day
;
and
Lady
Betty
Butler
,
knowing
it
,
sent
to
let
me
know
she
expected
my
company
in
the
evening
,
where
the
Vans
(
so
we
call
them
)
were
to
be
.
 
<EOS>
The
Duchess
and
they
do
not
go
over
this
summer
with
the
Duke
;
so
I
go
to
bed
.
  
<EOS>
2
.
 
<EOS>
This
rainy
weather
undoes
me
in
coaches
and
chairs
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
traipsing
to
-
day
with
your
Mr.
Sterne
,
to
go
along
with
them
to
Moore
,
and
recommend
his
business
to
the
Treasury
.
 
<EOS>
Sterne
tells
me
his
dependence
is
wholly
on
me
;
but
I
have
absolutely
refused
to
recommend
it
to
Mr.
Harley
,
because
I
have
troubled
him
lately
so
much
with
other
folks
'
affairs
;
and
besides
,
to
tell
the
truth
,
Mr.
Harley
told
me
he
did
not
like
Sterne
's
business
:
 
<EOS>
however
,
I
will
serve
him
,
because
I
suppose
MD
would
have
me
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
in
saying
his
dependence
lies
wholly
on
me
,
he
lies
,
and
is
a
fool
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
with
Lord
Abercorn
,
whose
son
Peasley
will
be
married
at
Easter
to
ten
thousand
pounds
.
  
<EOS>
3
.
 
<EOS>
I
forgot
to
tell
you
that
yesterday
morning
I
was
at
Mr.
Harley
's
levee
:
<EOS>
he
swore
I
came
in
spite
,
to
see
him
among
a
parcel
of
fools
.
 
<EOS>
My
business
was
to
desire
<EOS>
I
might
let
the
Duke
of
Ormond
know
how
the
affair
stood
of
the
First
-
Fruits
.
 
<EOS>
He
promised
to
let
him
know
it
,
and
engaged
me
to
dine
with
him
to
-
day
.
 
<EOS>
Every
Saturday
,
Lord
Keeper
,
Secretary
St.
John
,
and
I
dine
with
him
,
and
sometimes
Lord
Rivers
;
and
they
let
in
none
else
.
 
<EOS>
Patrick
brought
me
some
letters
into
the
Park
;
among
which
one
was
from
Walls
;
and
t'other
,
<EOS>
yes
,
faith
,
t'other
was
from
our
little
MD
,
N.11
.
 
<EOS>
I
read
the
rest
in
the
Park
,
and
MD
's
in
a
chair
as
I
went
from
St.
James
's
to
Mr.
Harley
;
and
glad
enough
I
was
,
faith
,
to
read
it
,
and
see
all
right
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
but
I
wo
n't
answer
it
these
three
or
four
days
at
least
,
or
may
be
sooner
.
 
<EOS>
An't
<EOS>
I
silly
?
<EOS>
faith
,
your
letters
would
make
a
dog
silly
,
if
I
had
a
dog
to
be
silly
,
but
it
must
be
a
little
dog
.
 
<EOS>
I
stayed
with
Mr.
Harley
till
past
nine
,
where
we
had
much
discourse
together
after
the
rest
were
gone
;
and
I
gave
him
very
truly
my
opinion
where
he
desired
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
complained
he
was
not
very
well
,
and
has
engaged
me
to
dine
with
him
again
on
Monday
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
came
home
afoot
,
like
a
fine
gentleman
,
to
tell
you
all
this
.
  
<EOS>
4
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
to
-
day
with
Mr.
Secretary
St.
John
;
and
after
dinner
he
had
a
note
from
Mr.
Harley
,
that
he
was
much
out
of
order
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
God
preserve
his
health
!
<EOS>
everything
depends
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
The
Parliament
at
present
can
not
go
a
step
without
him
,
nor
the
Queen
neither
.
 
<EOS>
I
long
to
be
in
Ireland
;
but
the
Ministry
beg
me
to
stay
:
 
however
,
when
this
Parliament
lurry
is
over
,
I
will
endeavour
to
steal
away
;
by
which
time
I
hope
the
First
-
Fruit
business
will
be
done
.
 
<EOS>
This
kingdom
is
certainly
ruined
as
much
as
was
ever
any
bankrupt
merchant
.
 
<EOS>
We
must
have
peace
,
let
it
be
a
bad
or
a
good
one
,
though
nobody
dares
talk
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
The
nearer
I
look
upon
things
,
the
worse
I
like
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
the
confederacy
will
soon
break
to
pieces
,
and
our
factions
at
home
increase
.
 
<EOS>
The
Ministry
is
upon
a
very
narrow
bottom
,
and
stand
like
an
isthmus
,
between
the
Whigs
on
one
side
,
and
violent
Tories
on
the
other
.
<EOS>
They
are
able
seamen
;
but
the
tempest
is
too
great
,
the
ship
too
rotten
,
and
the
crew
all
against
them
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Somers
has
been
twice
in
the
Queen
's
closet
,
once
very
lately
;
and
your
Duchess
of
Somerset
,
who
now
has
the
key
,
is
a
most
insinuating
woman
;
and
I
believe
they
will
endeavour
to
play
the
same
game
that
has
been
played
against
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
told
them
of
all
this
,
which
they
know
already
,
but
they
can
not
help
it
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
cautioned
the
Queen
so
much
against
being
governed
,
that
she
observes
it
too
much
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
talk
till
to
-
morrow
upon
these
things
,
but
they
make
me
melancholy
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
but
observe
that
lately
,
after
much
conversation
with
Mr.
Harley
,
though
he
is
the
most
fearless
man
alive
,
and
the
least
apt
to
despond
,
he
confessed
to
me
that
uttering
his
mind
to
me
gave
him
ease
.
  
<EOS>
5
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Harley
continues
out
of
order
,
yet
his
affairs
force
him
abroad
:
 
<EOS>
he
is
subject
to
a
sore
throat
,
and
was
cupped
last
night
:
 
<EOS>
I
sent
and
called
two
or
three
times
.
 
<EOS>
I
hear
he
is
better
this
evening
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
to
-
day
in
the
City
with
Dr.
Freind
at
a
third
body
's
house
,
where
I
was
to
pass
for
somebody
else
;
and
there
was
a
plaguy
silly
jest
carried
on
,
that
made
me
sick
of
it
.
<EOS>
Our
weather
grows
fine
,
and
I
will
walk
like
camomile
.
 
<EOS>
And
pray
walk
you
to
your
Dean
's
,
or
your
Stoyte
's
,
or
your
Manley
's
,
or
your
Walls
'
.
 
<EOS>
But
your
new
lodgings
make
you
so
proud
<EOS>
,
you
will
walk
less
than
ever
.
 
<EOS>
Come
,
let
me
go
to
bed
,
sirrahs
.

<EOS>
Mr.
Harley
's
going
out
yesterday
has
put
him
a
little
backwards
.
 
<EOS>
I
called
twice
,
and
sent
,
for
I
am
in
pain
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
Ford
caught
me
,
and
made
me
dine
with
him
on
his
Opera
-
day
;
so
I
brought
Mr.
Lewis
with
me
,
and
sat
with
him
till
six
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
seen
Mr.
Addison
these
three
weeks
;
all
our
friendship
is
over
.
 
<EOS>
I
go
to
no
Coffee
-
house
.
 
<EOS>
I
presented
a
parson
of
the
Bishop
of
Clogher
's
,
one
Richardson
,
to
the
Duke
of
Ormond
to
-
day
:
 
he
is
translating
prayers
and
sermons
into
Irish
,
and
has
a
project
about
instructing
the
Irish
in
the
Protestant
religion
.
  
<EOS>

.
 
<EOS>
Morning
.
 
<EOS>
Faith
,
a
little
would
make
me
,
I
could
find
in
my
heart
,
if
it
were
not
for
one
thing
,
I
have
a
good
mind
,
if
I
had
not
something
else
to
do
,
I
would
answer
your
dear
saucy
letter
.
 
<EOS>
O
,
Lord
,
I
am
going
awry
with
writing
in
bed
.
 
<EOS>
O
,
faith
,
<EOS>
but
I
must
answer
it
,
or
I
sha
n't
have
room
,
for
it
must
go
on
Saturday
;
and
do
n't
think
I
will
fill
the
third
side
<EOS>
,
I
an't
come
to
that
yet
,
young
women
.
 
<EOS>
Well
then
,
as
for
your
Bernage
,
I
have
said
enough
:
 
<EOS>
I
writ
to
him
last
week
.
 
<EOS>
Turn
over
that
leaf
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
what
says
MD
to
the
world
to
come
?
 
<EOS>
I
tell
you
,
Madam
Stella
,
my
head
is
a
great
deal
better
,
and
I
hope
will
keep
so
.
 
<EOS>
How
came
yours
to
be
fifteen
days
coming
,
and
you
had
my
fifteenth
in
seven
?
 
<EOS>
Answer
me
that
,
rogues
.
 
<EOS>
Your
being
with
Goody
Walls
is
excuse
enough
:
 
<EOS>
I
find
I
was
mistaken
in
the
sex
,
'
tis
a
boy
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
I
understand
your
cypher
,
and
Stella
guesses
right
,
as
she
always
does
.
 
<EOS>
He
gave
me
al
bsadnuk
lboinlpl
dfaonr
ufainf
btoy
dpionufnad
,
which
I
sent
him
again
by
Mr.
Lewis
,
to
whom
I
writ
a
very
complaining
letter
that
was
showed
him
;
and
so
the
matter
ended
.
 
<EOS>
He
told
me
he
had
a
quarrel
with
me
;
I
said
I
had
another
with
him
,
and
we
returned
to
our
friendship
,
and
I
should
think
he
loves
me
as
well
as
a
great
Minister
can
love
a
man
in
so
short
a
time
.
 
<EOS>
Did
not
I
do
right
?
 
<EOS>
I
am
glad
at
heart
<EOS>
you
have
got
your
palsy-
water
;
pray
God
Almighty
it
may
do
my
dearest
<EOS>
little
Stella
good
!
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
Mrs.
Edgworth
set
out
last
Monday
se'ennight
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
I
do
read
the
Examiners
,
and
they
are
written
very
finely
,
as
you
judge
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
they
are
too
severe
on
the
Duke
;
they
only
tax
him
of
avarice
,
and
his
avarice
has
ruined
us
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
count
upon
all
things
in
them
to
be
true
.
 
<EOS>
The
author
has
said
it
is
not
Prior
,
but
perhaps
it
may
be
Atterbury
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
Madam
Dingley
,
says
she
,
'
tis
fine
weather
,
says
she
;
yes
,
says
she
,
and
we
have
got
to
our
new
lodgings
.
 
<EOS>
I
compute
you
ought
to
save
eight
pounds
by
being
in
the
others
five
months
;
and
you
have
no
more
done
it
than
eight
thousand
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
glad
you
are
rid
of
that
squinting
,
blinking
Frenchman
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
give
you
a
bill
on
Parvisol
for
five
pounds
for
the
half
-
year
.
 
<EOS>
And
must
I
go
on
at
four
shillings
a
week
,
and
neither
eat
nor
drink
for
it
?
 
<EOS>
Who
the
Devil
said
Atterbury
and
your
Dean
were
alike
?
 
<EOS>
I
never
saw
your
Chancellor
,
nor
his
chaplain
.
 
<EOS>
The
latter
has
a
good
deal
of
learning
,
and
is
a
well
-
wisher
to
be
an
author
:
 
<EOS>
your
Chancellor
is
an
excellent
man
.
 
<EOS>
As
for
Patrick
's
bird
,
he
bought
him
for
his
tameness
,
and
is
grown
the
wildest
I
ever
saw
.
 
<EOS>
His
wings
have
been
quilled
thrice
,
and
are
now
up
again
:
 
he
will
be
able
to
fly
after
us
to
Ireland
,
if
he
be
willing
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
Mrs.
Stella
,
Dingley
writes
more
like
Presto
than
you
;
for
all
you
superscribed
the
letter
,
as
who
should
say
,
Why
should
not
I
write
like
our
Presto
as
well
as
Dingley
?
 
<EOS>
You
with
your
awkward
SS
<EOS>
;
can
not
you
write
them
thus
,
SS
?
 
<EOS>
No
,
but
always
SSS
.
 
<EOS>
Spiteful
sluts
,
to
affront
Presto
's
writing
<EOS>
;
as
that
when
you
shut
your
eyes
you
write
most
like
Presto
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
the
time
when
I
did
not
write
to
you
half
so
plain
as
I
do
now
;
but
I
take
pity
on
you
both
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
very
much
concerned
for
Mrs.
Walls
's
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
Walls
says
nothing
of
it
to
me
in
his
letter
dated
after
yours
.
<EOS>
You
say
,
"
If
she
recovers
,
she
may
lose
her
sight
.
"
 
<EOS>
I
hope
she
is
in
no
danger
of
her
life
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
Ford
is
as
sober
as
I
please
:
 
<EOS>
I
use
him
to
walk
with
me
as
an
easy
companion
,
always
ready
for
what
I
please
,
when
I
am
weary
of
business
and
Ministers
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
go
to
a
Coffee
-
house
twice
a
month
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
very
regular
in
going
to
sleep
before
eleven
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
you
say
that
Stella
is
a
pretty
girl
;
and
so
she
be
,
and
methinks
<EOS>
I
see
her
just
now
as
handsome
as
the
day
is
long
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
know
what
?
<EOS>
when
I
am
writing
in
our
language
,
I
make
up
my
mouth
just
as
if
I
was
speaking
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
caught
myself
at
it
just
now
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
suppose
Dingley
is
so
fair
and
so
fresh
as
a
lass
in
May
,
and
has
her
health
,
and
no
spleen
.
 
<EOS>
In
your
account
you
sent
<EOS>
do
you
reckon
as
usual
from
the
1st
of
November
<EOS>

twelvemonth
?
 
<EOS>
Poor
Stella
,
will
not
Dingley
leave
her
a
little
daylight
to
write
to
Presto
?
 
<EOS>
Well
,
well

we
'll
have
daylight
shortly

of

At
night
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Barton
sent
this
morning
to
invite
me
to
dinner
;
and
there
I
dined
,
just
in
that
genteel
manner
that
MD
used
when
they
would
treat
some
better
sort
of
body
than
usual
.
  
<EOS>

.
 
<EOS>
O
dear
MD
,
my
heart
is
almost
broken
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
hear
the
thing
before
this
comes
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
writ
a
full
account
of
it
this
night
to
the
Archbishop
of
Dublin
;
and
the
Dean
may
tell
you
the
particulars
from
the
Archbishop
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
in
a
sorry
way
to
write
,
but
thought
it
might
be
proper
to
send
a
true
account
of
the
fact
;
for
you
will
hear
a
thousand
lying
circumstances
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
of
Mr.
Harley
's
being
stabbed
this
afternoon
,
at
three
o'clock
,
at
a
Committee
of
the
Council
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
playing
Lady
Catharine
Morris
's
cards
,
where
I
dined
,
when
young
Arundel
came
in
with
the
story
.
 
<EOS>
I
ran
away
immediately
to
the
Secretary
,
which
was
in
my
way
:
 
<EOS>
no
one
was
at
home
.
 
<EOS>
I
met
Mrs.
St.
John
in
her
chair
;
she
had
heard
it
imperfectly
.
 
<EOS>
I
took
a
chair
to
Mr.
Harley
,
who
was
asleep
,
and
they
hope
in
no
danger
;
but
he
has
been
out
of
order
,
and
was
so
when
he
came
abroad
to
-
day
,
and
it
may
put
him
in
a
fever
:
 
<EOS>
I
am
in
mortal
pain
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
That
desperate
French
villain
,
Marquis
de
Guiscard
,
stabbed
Mr.
Harley
.
 
<EOS>
Guiscard
was
taken
up
by
Mr.
Secretary
St.
John
's
warrant
for
high
treason
,
and
brought
before
the
Lords
to
be
examined
;
there
he
stabbed
Mr.
Harley
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
told
all
the
particulars
already
to
the
Archbishop
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
now
,
at
nine
,
sent
again
,
and
they
tell
me
he
is
in
a
fair
way
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
pardon
my
distraction
;
I
now
think
of
all
his
kindness
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
The
poor
creature
now
lies
stabbed
in
his
bed
by
a
desperate
French
Popish
villain
.
<EOS>
Good
-
night
,
and
God
preserve
you
both
,
and
pity
me
;
I
want
it
.
  
<EOS>
9
.
 
<EOS>
Morning
;
seven
,
in
bed
.
 
<EOS>
Patrick
is
just
come
from
Mr.
Harley
's
.
 
<EOS>
He
slept
well
till
four
;
the
surgeon
sat
up
with
him
:
 
<EOS>
he
is
asleep
again
:
 
<EOS>
he
felt
a
pain
in
his
wound
when
he
waked
:
 
<EOS>
they
apprehend
him
in
no
danger
.
 
<EOS>
This
account
the
surgeon
left
with
the
porter
,
to
tell
people
that
send
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
God
preserve
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
rising
,
and
going
to
Mr.
Secretary
St.
John
.
 
<EOS>
They
say
Guiscard
will
die
with
the
wounds
Mr.
St.
John
and
the
rest
gave
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
tell
you
more
at
night
.
 
<EOS>
Night
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Harley
still
continues
on
the
mending
hand
;
but
he
rested
ill
last
night
,
and
felt
pain
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
early
with
the
Secretary
this
morning
,
and
I
dined
with
him
,
and
he
told
me
several
particularities
of
this
accident
,
too
long
to
relate
now
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Harley
is
still
mending
this
evening
,
but
not
at
all
out
of
danger
;
and
till
then
I
can
have
no
peace
.
 
<EOS>
Good
-
night
,
etc
.
,
and
pity
Presto
.
  
<EOS>

.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Harley
was
restless
last
night
;
but
he
has
no
fever
,
and
the
hopes
of
his
mending
increase
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
a
letter
from
Mr.
Walls
,
and
one
from
Mr.
Bernage
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
answer
them
here
,
not
having
time
to
write
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
 
Walls
writes
about
three
things
.
 
<EOS>
First
,
about
a
hundred
pounds
from
Dr.
Raymond
,
of
which
I
hear
nothing
,
and
it
is
now
too
late
.
 
<EOS>
Secondly
,
about
Mr.
Clements
:
 
I
can
do
nothing
in
it
,
because
I
am
not
to
mention
Mr.
Pratt
;
and
I
can
not
recommend
without
knowing
Mr.
Pratt
's
objections
,
whose
relation
Clements
is
,
and
who
brought
him
into
the
place
.
 
<EOS>
The
third
is
about
my
being
godfather
to
the
child
:
 
<EOS>
that
is
in
my
power
,
and
(
since
there
is
no
remedy
)
will
submit
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
you
could
hinder
it
;
but
if
it
ca
n't
be
helped
,
pay
what
you
think
proper
,
and
get
the
Provost
to
stand
for
me
,
and
let
his
Christian
name
be
Harley
,
in
honour
of
my
friend
,
now
lying
stabbed
and
doubtful
of
his
life
.
 
<EOS>
As
for
Bernage
,
he
writes
me
word
that
his
colonel
has
offered
to
make
him
captain
-
lieutenant
for
a
hundred
pounds
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
such
a
fool
to
offer
him
money
without
writing
to
me
till
it
was
done
,
though
I
have
had
a
dozen
letters
from
him
;
and
then
he
desires
I
would
say
nothing
of
this
,
for
fear
his
colonel
should
be
angry
.
 
<EOS>
People
are
mad
.
 
<EOS>
What
can
I
do
?
 
<EOS>
I
engaged
Colonel
Disney
,
who
was
one
of
his
solicitors
to
the
Secretary
,
and
then
told
him
the
story
.
 
<EOS>
He
assured
me
that
Fielding
(
Bernage
's
colonel
)
said
he
might
have
got
that
sum
;
but
,
on
account
of
those
great
recommendations
he
had
,
would
give
it
him
for
nothing
:
 
and
I
would
have
Bernage
write
him
a
letter
of
thanks
,
as
of
a
thing
given
him
for
nothing
,
upon
recommendations
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
Disney
tells
me
he
will
again
speak
to
Fielding
,
and
clear
up
this
matter
;
then
I
will
write
to
Bernage
.
 
<EOS>
A
pox
on
him
for
promising
money
till
I
had
it
promised
to
me
;
and
then
making
it
such
a
ticklish
point
,
that
one
can
not
expostulate
with
the
colonel
upon
it
:
 
but
let
him
do
as
I
say
,
and
there
is
an
end
.
 
<EOS>
I
engaged
the
Secretary
of
State
in
it
;
and
am
sure
it
was
meant
a
kindness
to
me
,
and
that
no
money
should
be
given
,
and
a
hundred
pounds
is
too
much
in
a
Smithfield
bargain
,
as
a
major
-
general
told
me
,
whose
opinion
I
asked
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
now
hurried
,
and
can
say
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
Farewell
,
etc
.
<EOS>
etc
.
  
<EOS>
How
shall
I
superscribe
to
your
new
lodgings
,
pray
,
madams
?
 
<EOS>
Tell
me
but
that
,
impudence
and
saucy
-
face
.
  
<EOS>
Are
not
you
sauceboxes
to
write
"
lele
"
like
Presto
?
 
<EOS>
O
poor
Presto
!
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Harley
is
better
to
-
night
,
that
makes
me
so
pert
,
you
saucy
Gog

LETTER

<EOS>
LONDON
,
March
10
,
1710
-
11
.
  
<EOS>
Pretty
little
MD
must
expect
little
from
me
till
Mr.
Harley
is
out
of
danger
.
<EOS>
We
hope
he
is
so
now
;
but
I
am
subject
to
fear
for
my
friends
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
a
head
full
of
the
whole
business
of
the
nation
,
was
out
of
order
when
the
villain
stabbed
him
,
and
had
a
cruel
contusion
by
the
second
blow
.
 
<EOS>
But
all
goes
on
well
yet
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Ford
and
I
dined
with
Mr.
Lewis
,
and
we
hope
the
best
.
  
<EOS>
11
.
 
<EOS>
This
morning
Mr.
Secretary
and
I
met
at
Court
,
where
he
went
to
the
Queen
,
who
is
out
of
order
,
and
aguish
:
 
<EOS>
I
doubt
the
worse
for
this
accident
to
Mr.
Harley
.
 
<EOS>
We
went
together
to
his
house
,
and
his
wound
looks
well
,
and
he
is
not
feverish
at
all
,
and
I
think
it
is
foolish
in
me
to
be
so
much
in
pain
as
I
am
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
the
penknife
in
my
hand
,
which
is
broken
within
a
quarter
of
an
inch
of
the
handle
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
mind
to
write
and
publish
an
account
of
all
the
particularities
of
this
fact
:
 
<EOS>
it
will
be
very
curious
,
and
I
would
do
it
when
Mr.
Harley
is
past
danger
.
  
<EOS>
12
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
been
in
terrible
pain
to
-
day
about
Mr.
Harley
,
who
never
slept
last
night
,
and
has
been
very
feverish
.
 
<EOS>
But
this
evening
I
called
there
;
and
young
Mr.
Harley
(
his
only
son
)
tells
me
he
is
now
much
better
,
and
was
then
asleep
.
 
<EOS>
They
let
nobody
see
him
,
and
that
is
perfectly
right
.
 
<EOS>
The
Parliament
can
not
go
on
till
he
is
well
,
and
are
forced
to
adjourn
their
money
businesses
,
which
none
<EOS>
but
he
can
help
them
in
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
God
preserve
him
.
  
<EOS>
13
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Harley
is
better
to
-
day
,
slept
well
all
night
,
and
we
are
a
little
out
of
our
fears
.
 
<EOS>
I
send
and
call
three
or
four
times
every
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
went
into
the
City
for
a
walk
,
and
dined
there
with
a
private
man
;
and
coming
home
this
evening
,
broke
my
shin
in
the
Strand
over
a
tub
of
sand
left
just
in
the
way
.
<EOS>
I
got
home
dirty
enough
,
and
went
straight
to
bed
,
where
I
have
been
cooking
it
with
gold
-
beater
's
skin
,
and
have
been
peevish
enough
with
Patrick
,
who
was
near
an
hour
bringing
a
rag
from
next
door
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
my
right
shin
,
where
never
any
humour
fell
when
t'other
used
to
swell
;
so
I
apprehend
it
less
:
 
<EOS>
however
,
I
shall
not
stir
till
'
tis
well
,
which
I
reckon
will
be
in
a
week
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
very
careful
in
these
sort
of
things
;
but
I
wish
I
had
Mrs.
J
<EOS>
#
#
#
#
's
water
:
she
is
out
of
town
,
and
I
must
make
a
shift
with
alum
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
dine
with
Mrs.
Vanhomrigh
till
I
am
well
,
who
lives
but
five
doors
off
;
and
that
I
may
venture
.
  
<EOS>
14
.
 
<EOS>
My
journals
are
like
to
be
very
diverting
,
now
I
can
not
stir
abroad
,
between
accounts
of
Mr.
Harley
's
mending
,
and
of
my
broken
shin
.
 
<EOS>
I
just
walked
to
my
neighbour
Vanhomrigh
at
two
,
and
came
away
at
six
,
when
little
Harrison
the
Tatler
came
to
me
,
and
begged
me
to
dictate
a
paper
to
him
,
which
I
was
forced
in
charity
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Harley
still
mends
;
and
I
hope
in
a
day
or
two
to
trouble
you
no
more
with
him
,
nor
with
my
shin
.
 
<EOS>
Go
to
bed
and
sleep
,
sirrahs
,
that
you
may
rise
to
-
morrow
and
walk
to
Donnybrook
,
and
lose
your
money
with
Stoyte
and
the
Dean
;
do
so
,
dear
little
rogues
,
and
drink
Presto
's
health

<EOS>
O
pray

do
n't
you
drink
Presto

sometimes
with
your
deans
,
and
your
Stoytes
,
and
your
Walls
,
and
your
Manleys

and
your

a

<EOS>
I
was
this
morning
at
Mr.
Secretary
St.
John
's
for
all
my
shin
;
and
he
has
given
me
for
young
Harrison
the
Tatler
the
prettiest
employment
in
Europe
;
secretary
to
my
Lord
Raby
,
who
is
to
be
Ambassador
Extraordinary
at
the
Hague
,
where
all
the
great
affairs
will
be
concerted
;
so
we
shall
lose
the
Tatlers
in
a
fortnight
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
send
Harrison
to
-
morrow
morning
to
thank
the
Secretary
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
Biddy
Floyd
has
got
the
smallpox
.
 
<EOS>
I
called
this
morning
to
see
Lady
Betty
Germaine
,
and
when
she
told
me
so
,
I
fairly
took
my
leave
.
<EOS>
I
have
the
luck
of
it
;
for
about
ten
days
ago
I
was
to
see
Lord
Carteret
;
and
my
lady
was
entertaining
me
with
telling
of
a
young
lady
,
a
cousin
,
who
was
then
ill
in
the
house
of
the
smallpox
,
and
is
since
dead
:
 
<EOS>
it
was
near
Lady
Betty
's
,
and
I
fancy
Biddy
took
the
fright
by
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
with
Mr.
Secretary
;
and
a
physician
came
in
just
from
Guiscard
,
who
tells
us
he
is
dying
of
his
wounds
,
and
can
hardly
live
till
to
-
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
A
poor
wench
that
Guiscard
kept
,
sent
him
a
bottle
of
sack
;
but
the
keeper
would
not
let
him
touch
it
,
for
fear
it
was
poison
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
two
quarts
of
old
clotted
blood
come
out
of
his
side
to
-
day
,
and
is
delirious
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
sorry
he
is
dying
;
for
they
had
found
out
a
way
to
hang
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
certainly
had
an
intention
to
murder
the
Queen
.
  
<EOS>
16
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
made
but
<EOS>
little
progress
in
this
letter
for
so
many
days
,
thanks
to
Guiscard
and
Mr.
Harley
;
and
it
would
be
endless
to
tell
you
all
the
particulars
of
that
odious
fact
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
yet
hear
that
Guiscard
is
dead
,
but
they
say
'
tis
impossible
he
should
recover
.
 
<EOS>
I
walked
too
much
yesterday
for
a
man
with
a
broken
shin
;
to
-
day
I
rested
,
and
went
no
farther
than
Mrs.
Vanhomrigh
's
,
where
I
dined
;
and
Lady
Betty
Butler
coming
in
about
six
<EOS>
,
I
was
forced
in
good
manners
to
sit
with
her
till
nine
;
then
I
came
home
,
and
Mr.
Ford
came
in
to
visit
my
shin
,
and
sat
with
me
till
eleven
:
 
<EOS>
so
I
have
been
very
idle
and
naughty
.
 
<EOS>
It
vexes
me
to
the
pluck
that
I
should
lose
walking
this
delicious
day
.
 
<EOS>
Have
you
seen
the
Spectator
yet
,
a
paper
that
comes
out
every
day
?
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
written
by
Mr.
Steele
,
who
seems
to
have
gathered
new
life
,
and
have
a
new
fund
of
wit
;
it
is
in
the
same
nature
as
his
Tatlers
,
and
they
have
all
of
them
had
something
pretty
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
Addison
and
he
club
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
see
them
;
and
I
plainly
told
Mr.
Harley
and
Mr.
St.
John
,
ten
days
ago
,
before
my
Lord
Keeper
and
Lord
Rivers
,
that
I
had
been
foolish
enough
to
spend
my
credit
with
them
in
favour
of
Addison
and
Steele
;
but
that
I
would
engage
and
promise
never
to
say
one
word
in
their
behalf
,
having
been
used
so
ill
for
what
I
had
already
done
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
now
I
am
got
into
the
way
of
prating
again
,
there
will
be
no
quiet
for
me
.
       
<EOS>
When
Presto
begins
to
prate
,
     
Give
him
a
rap
upon
the
pate
.
  
<EOS>
O
Lord
,
how
I
blot
!
<EOS>
it
is
time
to
leave
off
,
etc

Guiscard
died
this
morning
at
two
;
and
the
coroner
's
inquest
have
found
that
he
was
killed
by
bruises
received
from
a
messenger
,
so
to
clear
the
Cabinet
Councillors
from
whom
he
received
his
wounds
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
a
letter
from
Raymond
,
who
can
not
hear
of
your
box
;
but
I
hope
you
have
it
before
this
comes
to
your
hands
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
to
-
day
with
Mr.
Lewis
of
the
Secretary
's
office
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Harley
has
abundance
of
extravasated
blood
comes
from
his
breast
out
of
his
wound
,
and
will
not
be
well
so
soon
as
we
expected
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
something
to
say
,
but
can
not
call
it
to
mind
.
 
<EOS>
(
What
was
it
?
)
  
<EOS>
18
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
to
-
day
at
Court
to
look
for
the
Duke
of
Argyle
,
and
gave
him
the
memorial
about
Bernage
.
 
<EOS>
The
Duke
goes
with
the
first
fair
wind
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
find
him
,
but
I
have
given
the
memorial
to
another
to
give
him
;
and
,
however
,
it
shall
be
sent
after
him
.
 
<EOS>
Bernage
has
made
a
blunder
in
offering
money
to
his
colonel
without
my
advice
;
however
,
he
is
made
captain
-
lieutenant
,
only
he
must
recruit
the
company
,
which
will
cost
him
forty
pounds
,
and
that
is
cheaper
than
an
hundred
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
to
-
day
with
Mr.
Secretary
St.
John
,
and
stayed
till
seven
,
but
would
not
drink
his
champagne
and
burgundy
,
for
fear
of
the
gout
.
 
<EOS>
My
shin
mends
,
but
is
not
well
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
it
will
by
the
time
I
send
this
letter
,
next
Saturday
.
  
<EOS>
19
.
 
<EOS>
I
went
to
-
day
into
the
City
,
but
in
a
coach
,
and
sossed
up
my
leg
on
the
seat
;
and
as
I
came
home
,
I
went
to
see
poor
Charles
Barnard
's
books
,
which
are
to
be
sold
by
auction
,
and
I
itch
to
lay
out
nine
or
ten
pounds
for
some
fine
editions
of
fine
authors
.
 
<EOS>
But
'
tis
too
far
,
and
I
shall
let
it
slip
,
as
I
usually
do
all
such
opportunities
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
in
a
coffee
-
house
with
Stratford
upon
chops
and
some
of
his
wine
.
 
<EOS>
Where
did
MD
dine
?
 
<EOS>
Why
,
poor
MD
dined
at
home
to
-
day
,
because
of
the
Archbishop
,
and
they
could
not
go
abroad
,
and
had
a
breast
of
mutton
and
a
pint
of
wine
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
Mrs.
Walls
mends
;
and
pray
give
me
an
account
what
sort
of
godfather
I
made
,
and
whether
I
behaved
myself
handsomely
.
 
<EOS>
The
Duke
of
Argyle
is
gone
;
and
whether
he
has
my
memorial
,
I
know
not
,
till
I
see
Dr.
Arbuthnot
,
to
whom
I
gave
it
.
 
<EOS>
That
hard
name
belongs
to
a
Scotch
doctor
,
an
acquaintance
of
the
Duke
's
and
me
;
Stella
ca
n't
pronounce
it
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
that
we
were
at
Laracor
this
fine
day
!
<EOS>
the
willows
begin
to
peep
,
and
the
quicks
to
bud
.
 
<EOS>
My
dream
is
out
:
 
<EOS>
I
was
a
-
dreamed
last
night
that
I
ate
ripe
cherries
.
 
<EOS>
And
now
they
begin
to
catch
the
pikes
,
and
will
shortly
the
trouts
(
pox
on
these
Ministers
!
)
 
<EOS>
and
I
would
fain
<EOS>
know
whether
the
floods
were
ever
so
high
as
to
get
over
the
holly
bank
or
the
river
<EOS>
walk
;
if
so
,
then
all
my
pikes
are
gone
;
but
I
hope
not
.
 
<EOS>
Why
do
n't
you
ask
Parvisol
these
things
,
sirrahs
?
 
<EOS>
And
then
my
canal
,
and
trouts
,
and
whether
the
bottom
be
fine
and
clear
?
 
<EOS>
But
harkee
,
ought
not
Parvisol
to
pay
in
my
last
year
's
rents
and
arrears
out
of
his
hands
?
 
<EOS>
I
am
thinking
,
if
either
of
you
have
heads
to
take
his
accounts
,
it
should
be
paid
in
to
you
;
otherwise
to
Mr.
Walls
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
write
an
order
on
t'other
side
;
and
do
as
you
will
.
 
<EOS>
Here
's
a
world
of
business
;
but
I
must
go
sleep
<EOS>
,
I
'm
drowsy
;
and
so
goodnight
,
etc
.
  
<EOS>

.
 
<EOS>
This
sore
shin
ruins
me
in
coach
-
hire
;
no
less
than
two
shillings
to
-
day
going
and
coming
from
the
City
,
where
I
dined
with
one
you
never
heard
of
,
and
passed
an
insipid
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
writ
this
post
to
Bernage
,
with
the
account
I
told
you
above
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
he
will
like
it
;
'
tis
his
own
fault
,
or
it
would
have
been
better
.
 
<EOS>
I
reckon
your
next
letter
will
be
full
of
Mr.
Harley
's
stabbing
.
 
<EOS>
He
still
mends
,
but
abundance
of
extravasated
blood
has
come
out
of
the
wound
:
he
keeps
his
bed
,
and
sees
nobody
.
 
<EOS>
The
Speaker
's
eldest
son
is
just
dead
of
the
smallpox
,
and
the
House
is
adjourned
a
week
,
to
give
him
time
to
wipe
off
his
tears
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
it
very
handsomely
done
;
but
I
believe
one
reason
is
,
that
they
want
Mr.
Harley
so
much
.
 
<EOS>
Biddy
Floyd
is
like
to
do
well
:
 
and
so
go
to
your
Dean
's
,
and
roast
his
oranges
,
and
lose
your
money
,
do
so
,
you
saucy
sluts
.
 
<EOS>
Stella
,
you
lost
three
shillings
and
fourpence
t'other
night
at
Stoyte
's
,
yes
,
you
did
,
and
Presto
stood
in
a
corner
,
and
saw
you
all
the
while
,
and
then
stole
away
.
 
<EOS>
I
dream
very
often
<EOS>
I
am
in
Ireland
,
and
that
I
have
left
my
clothes
and
things
behind
me
,
and
have
not
taken
leave
of
anybody
;
and
that
the
Ministry
expect
me
tomorrow
,
and
such
nonsense
.
  
<EOS>
21
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
not
for
a
guinea
have
a
letter
from
you
till
this
goes
;
and
go
it
shall
on
Saturday
,
faith
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
with
Mrs.
Vanhomrigh
,
to
save
my
shin
,
and
then
went
on
some
business
to
the
Secretary
,
and
he
was
not
at
home
.
  
<EOS>
22
.
 
<EOS>
Yesterday
was
a
short
day
's
journal
:
 
but
<EOS>
what
care
I
?
<EOS>
what
cares
saucy
Presto
?
 
<EOS>
Darteneuf
invited
me
to
dinner
to
-
day
.
 
<EOS>
Do
not
you
know
Darteneuf
?
 
<EOS>
That
's
the
man
that
knows
everything
,
and
that
everybody
knows
;
and
that
knows
where
a
knot
of
rabble
are
going
on
a
holiday
,
and
when
they
were
there
last
:
 
and
<EOS>
then
I
went
to
the
Coffee
-
house
.
 
<EOS>
My
shin
mends
,
but
is
not
quite
healed
:
 
<EOS>
I
ought
to
keep
it
up
,
but
I
do
n't
<EOS>
;
I
e'en
let
it
go
as
it
comes
.
 
<EOS>
Pox
take
Parvisol
and
his
watch
!
 
<EOS>
If
I
do
not
receive
the
ten
-
pound
bill
I
am
to
get
towards
it
,
I
will
neither
receive
watch
nor
chain
;
so
let
Parvisol
know
.
  
<EOS>
23
.
 
<EOS>
I
this
day
appointed
the
Duke
of
Ormond
to
meet
him
at
Ned
Southwell
's
,
about
an
affair
of
printing
Irish
Prayer
-
Books
,
etc
.
,
but
the
Duke
never
came
.
 
<EOS>
There
<EOS>
Southwell
had
letters
that
two
packets
are
taken
;
so
if
MD
writ
then
,
the
letters
are
gone
;
for
they
are
packets
coming
hither
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Harley
is
not
yet
well
,
but
his
extravasated
blood
continues
,
and
I
doubt
he
will
not
be
quite
well
in
a
good
while
:
 
<EOS>
I
find
you
have
heard
of
the
fact
by
Southwell
's
letters
from
Ireland
:
 
<EOS>
what
do
you
think
of
it
?
 
<EOS>
I
dined
with
Sir
John
Perceval
,
and
saw
his
lady
sitting
in
the
bed
,
in
the
forms
of
a
lying
-
in
woman
;
and
coming
home
my
sore
shin
itched
,
and
I
forgot
what
it
was
,
and
rubbed
off
the
scab
,
and
blood
came
;
but
I
am
now
got
into
bed
,
and
have
put
on
alum
curd
,
and
it
is
almost
well
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Rivers
told
me
yesterday
a
piece
of
bad
news
,
as
a
secret
,
that
the
Pretender
is
going
to
be
married
to
the
Duke
of
Savoy
's
daughter
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
very
bad
if
it
be
true
.
 
<EOS>
We
were
walking
in
the
Mall
with
some
Scotch
lords
,
and
he
could
not
tell
it
until
they
were
gone
,
and
he
bade
me
tell
it
to
none
but
the
Secretary
of
State
and
MD
.
 
<EOS>
This
goes
tomorrow
,
and
I
have
no
room
but
to
bid
my
dearest
little
MD
good
-
night
.
<EOS>
24
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
now
seal
up
this
letter
,
and
send
it
;
for
I
reckon
to
have
none
from
you
(
'
tis
morning
now
)
between
this
and
night
;
and
I
will
put
it
in
the
post
with
my
own
hands

<EOS>
I
am
going
out
in
great
haste

LETTER
19
.
 
<EOS>
LONDON
,
March
24
,
1710
-
11
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
little
cross
in
Presto
not
to
send
to
-
day
to
the
Coffee
-
house
to
see
whether
there
was
a
letter
from
MD
before
I
sent
away
mine
;
but
,
faith
,
I
did
it
on
purpose
,
because
I
would
scorn
to
answer
two
letters
of
yours
successively
.
 
<EOS>
This
way
of
journal
is
the
worst
in
the
world
for
writing
of
news
,
unless
one
does
it
the
last
day
;
and
so
I
will
observe
henceforward
,
if
there
be
any
politics
or
stuff
worth
sending
.
 
<EOS>
My
shin
mends
in
spite
of
the
scratching
last
night
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
to
-
day
at
Ned
Southwell
's
with
the
Bishop
of
Ossory
and
a
parcel
of
Irish
gentlemen
.
 
<EOS>
Have
you
yet
seen
any
of
the
Spectators
?
 
<EOS>
Just
three
weeks
to
-
day
since
I
had
your
last
,
N.11
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
afraid
I
have
lost
one
by
the
packet
that
was
taken
;
that
will
vex
me
,
considering
the
pains
MD
take
to
write
,
especially
poor
pretty
Stella
,
and
her
weak
eyes
.
<EOS>
God
bless
them
and
the
owner
,
and
send
them
well
,
and
little
me
together
,
I
hope
ere
long
.
 
<EOS>
This
illness
of
Mr.
Harley
puts
everything
backwards
,
and
he
is
still
down
,
and
like
to
be
so
,
by
that
extravasated
blood
which
comes
from
his
breast
to
the
wound
:
 
<EOS>
it
was
by
the
second
blow
Guiscard
gave
him
after
the
penknife
was
broken
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
shocked
at
that
villainy
whenever
I
think
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
Biddy
Floyd
is
past
danger
,
but
will
lose
all
her
beauty
:
 
<EOS>
she
had
them
mighty
thick
,
especially
about
her
nose
.
  
<EOS>
25
.
 
<EOS>
Morning
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
you
a
merry
New
Year
;
this
is
the
first
day
of
the
year
,
you
know
,
with
us
,
and
'
tis
Lady
-
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
rise
and
go
to
my
Lord
Keeper
:
it
is
not
shaving
-
day
to
-
day
,
so
I
shall
be
early
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
to
dine
with
Mr.
Secretary
St.
John
.
 
<EOS>
Good
-
morrow
,
my
mistresses
both
,
good
-
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
Stella
will
be
peeping
out
of
her
room
at
Mrs.
De
Caudres
"
down
upon
the
folks
as
they
come
from
church
;
and
there
comes
Mrs.
Proby
,
and
that
is
my
Lady
Southwell
,
and
there
is
Lady
Betty
Rochfort
.
 
<EOS>
I
long
to
hear
how
you
are
settled
in
your
new
lodgings
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
I
were
rid
of
my
old
ones
,
and
that
Mrs.
Brent
could
contrive
to
put
up
my
books
in
boxes
,
and
lodge
them
in
some
safe
place
,
and
you
keep
my
papers
of
importance
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
must
rise
,
I
tell
you
.
 
<EOS>
At
night
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
visited
and
dined
as
I
told
you
,
and
what
of
that
?
 
<EOS>
We
have
let
Guiscard
be
buried
at
last
,
after
showing
him
pickled
in
a
trough
this
fortnight
for
twopence
apiece
:
 
and
the
fellow
that
showed
would
point
to
his
body
,
and
,
"
See
,
gentlemen
,
this
is
the
wound
that
was
given
him
by
his
Grace
the
Duke
of
Ormond
;
and
this
is
the
wound
,
"
etc
.
,
and
then
the
show
was
over
,
and
another
set
of
rabble
came
in
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
hard
our
laws
would
not
suffer
us
to
hang
his
body
in
chains
,
because
he
was
not
tried
;
and
in
the
eye
of
our
law
every
man
is
innocent
till
then
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Harley
is
still
very
weak
,
and
never
out
of
bed
.
  
<EOS>
26
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
a
most
delicious
day
;
and
my
shin
being
past
danger
,
I
walked
like
lightning
above
two
hours
in
the
Park
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
generally
one
fair
day
,
and
then
a
great
deal
of
rain
for
three
or
four
days
together
.
 
<EOS>
All
things
are
at
a
stop
in
Parliament
for
want
of
Mr.
Harley
;
they
can
not
stir
an
inch
without
him
in
their
most
material
affairs
:
 
and
we
fear
,
by
the
caprice
of
Radcliffe
,
who
will
admit
none
but
his
own
surgeon
,
he
has
not
been
well
looked
after
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
at
an
alehouse
with
Mr.
Lewis
,
but
had
his
wine
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
begin
to
see
the
flowers
and
blossoms
of
the
field
?
 
<EOS>
How
busy
should
I
be
now
at
Laracor
!
 
<EOS>
No
news
of
your
box
?
 
<EOS>
I
hope
you
have
it
,
and
are
this
minute
drinking
the
chocolate
,
and
that
the
smell
of
the
Brazil
tobacco
has
not
affected
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
be
glad
to
know
whether
you
like
it
,
because
I
would
send
you
more
by
people
that
are
now
every
day
thinking
of
going
to
Ireland
<EOS>
;
therefore
pray
tell
me
,
and
tell
me
soon
:
and
I
will
have
the
strong
box
.
  
<EOS>

<EOS>
A
rainy
,
wretched
,
scurvy
day
from
morning
till
night
:
 
and
my
neighbour
Vanhomrigh
invited
me
to
dine
with
them
and
<EOS>
this
evening
I
passed
at
Mr.
Prior
<EOS>
's
with
Dr.
Freind
;
and
'
tis
now
past
twelve
,
so
I
must
go
sleep
.
  
<EOS>
28
.
 
<EOS>
Morning
.
 
<EOS>
O
,
faith
<EOS>
,
you
're
an
impudent
saucy
couple
of
sluttikins
for
presuming
to
write
so
soon
,
said
I
to
myself
this
morning
;
who
knows
but
there
may
be
a
letter
from
MD
at
the
Coffee
-
house
?
 
<EOS>
Well
,
you
must
know
,
and
so
,
I
just
now
sent
Patrick
,
and
he
brought
me
three
letters
,
but
not
one
from
MD
,
no
indeed
,
for
I
read
all
the
superscriptions
;
and
not
one
from
MD
.
 
<EOS>
One
<EOS>
I
opened
<EOS>
,
it
was
from
the
Archbishop
;
t'other
I
opened
,
it
was
from
Staunton
;
the
third
I
took
,
and
looked
at
the
hand
.
 
<EOS>
Whose
hand
is
this
?
<EOS>
says
I
;
yes
,
says
I
,
whose
hand
is
this
?
 
<EOS>
Then
there
was
wax
between
the
folds
;
then
I
began
to
suspect
;
then
I
peeped
;
faith
,
it
was
Walls
's
hand
after
all
:
 
<EOS>
then
I
opened
it
in
a
rage
,
and
then
it
was
little
MD
's
hand
,
dear
,
little
,
pretty
,
charming
MD
's
sweet
hand
again
.
 
<EOS>
O
Lord
,
an't
here
<EOS>
a
clutter
and
a
stir
,
and
a
bustle
?
<EOS>
never
saw
the
like
.
 
<EOS>
Faith
,
I
believe
yours
lay
some
days
at
the
post
-
office
,
and
that
it
came
before
my
eighteenth
went
,
but
that
I
did
not
expect
it
,
and
I
hardly
ever
go
there
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
and
so
you
think
I
'll
answer
this
letter
now
;
no
,
faith
,
and
so
I
wo
n't
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
make
you
wait
,
young
women
;
but
I
'll
inquire
immediately
about
poor
Dingley
's
exchequer
trangum
.
 
<EOS>
What
,
is
that
Vedel
again
a
soldier
?
<EOS>
was
he
broke
?
 
<EOS>
I
'll
put
it
in
Ben
Tooke
's
hand
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
Vedel
could
not
sell
it
.
 
<EOS>
At
night
.
 
<EOS>
Vedel
,
Vedel
,
poh
,
pox
,
I
think
it
is
Vedeau
;
ay
,
Vedeau
,
now
I
have
it
;
let
me
see
,
do
you
name
him
in
yours
?
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
Mr.
John
Vedeau
is
the
brother
;
but
where
does
this
brother
live
?
 
<EOS>
I
'll
inquire
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
a
fast
-
day
for
the
public
;
so
I
dined
late
with
Sir
Matthew
Dudley
,
whom
I
have
not
been
with
a
great
while
.
<EOS>
He
is
one
of
those
that
must
lose
his
employment
whenever
the
great
shake
comes
;
and
I
ca
n't
contribute
to
keep
him
in
,
though
I
have
dropped
words
in
his
favour
to
the
Ministry
;
but
he
is
too
violent
<EOS>
a
Whig
,
and
friend
to
the
Lord
Treasurer
,
to
stay
in
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
odd
to
think
how
long
they
let
those
people
keep
their
places
;
but
the
reason
is
,
they
have
not
enough
to
satisfy
all
expecters
,
and
so
they
keep
them
all
in
hopes
,
that
they
may
be
good
boys
in
the
meantime
;
and
thus
the
old
ones
hold
in
still
.
 
<EOS>
The
Comptroller
told
me
that
there
are
eight
people
expect
his
staff
.
 
<EOS>
I
walked
after
dinner
to
-
day
round
the
Park
.
 
<EOS>
What
,
do
I
write
politics
to
little
young
women
?
 
<EOS>
Hold
your
tongue
,
and
go
to
your
Dean
's
.
  
<EOS>
29
.
 
<EOS>
Morning
.
 
<EOS>
If
this
be
a
fine
day
,
I
will
walk
into
the
City
,
and
see
Charles
Barnard
's
library
.
 
<EOS>
What
care
I
for
your
letter
,
saucy
N.12
?
 
<EOS>
I
will
say
nothing
to
it
yet
:
 
<EOS>
faith
,
I
believe
this
will
be
full
before
its
time
,
and
then
go
it
must
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
always
write
once
a
fortnight
;
and
if
it
goes
sooner
by
filling
sooner
,
why
,
then
there
is
so
much
clear
gain
.
 
<EOS>
Morrow
,
morrow
,
rogues
and
lasses
both
,
I
ca
n't
lie
scribbling
here
in
bed
for
your
play
;
I
must
rise
,
and
so
morrow
again
.
 
<EOS>
At
night
.
 
<EOS>
Your
friend
Montgomery
and
his
sister
are
here
,
as
I
am
told
by
Patrick
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
seen
him
often
,
but
take
no
notice
of
him
:
 
<EOS>
he
is
grown
very
ugly
and
pimpled
.
 
<EOS>
They
tell
me
he
is
a
gamester
,
and
wins
money
.
 
<EOS>
How
could
I
help
it
,
pray
?
 
<EOS>
Patrick
snuffed
the
candle
too
short
,
and
the
grease
ran
down
upon
the
paper
.
 
<EOS>
It
an't
my
fault
,
'
tis
Patrick
's
fault
;
pray
now
do
n't
blame
Presto
.
 
<EOS>
I
walked
today
in
the
City
,
and
dined
at
a
private
house
,
and
went
to
see
the
auction
of
poor
Charles
Barnard
's
books
;
they
were
in
the
middle
of
the
physic
books
,
so
I
bought
none
;
and
they
are
so
dear
,
<EOS>
I
believe
I
shall
buy
none
,
and
there
is
an
end
;
and
go
to
Stoyte
's
,
and
I
'll
go
sleep
.
  
<EOS>
30
.
 
<EOS>
Morning
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
Good
Friday
,
you
must
know
;
and
I
must
rise
and
go
to
Mr.
Secretary
about
some
business
,
and
Mrs.
Vanhomrigh
desires
me
to
breakfast
with
her
,
because
she
is
to
intercede
for
Patrick
,
who
is
so
often
drunk
and
quarrelsome
in
the
house
,
that
I
was
resolved
to
send
him
over
;
but
he
knows
all
the
places
where
I
send
,
and
is
so
used
to
my
ways
,
that
it
would
be
inconvenient
to
me
;
but
when
I
come
to
Ireland
,
I
will
discharge
him
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
Thomas
Mansel
,
one
of
the
Lords
of
the
Treasury
,
setting
me
down
at
my
door
to
-
day
,
saw
Patrick
,
and
swore
he
was
a
Teague
-
lander
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
so
used
to
his
face
<EOS>
,
I
never
observed
it
,
but
thought
him
a
pretty
fellow
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
Andrew
Fountaine
<EOS>
and
I
supped
this
fast
-
day
with
Mrs.
Vanhomrigh
.
 
<EOS>
We
were
afraid
Mr.
Harley
's
wound
would
turn
to
a
fistula
;
but
we
think
the
danger
is
now
past
.
<EOS>
He
rises
every
day
,
and
walks
about
his
room
,
and
we
hope
he
will
be
out
in
a
fortnight
.
 
<EOS>
Prior
showed
me
a
handsome
paper
of
verses
he
has
writ
on
Mr.
Harley
's
accident
:
 
<EOS>
they
are
not
out
;
I
will
send
them
to
you
,
if
he
will
give
me
a
copy
.
  
<EOS>
31
.
 
<EOS>
Morning
.
 
<EOS>
What
shall
we
do
to
make
April
fools
this
year
<EOS>
,
now
it
happens
on
Sunday
?
 
<EOS>
Patrick
brings
word
that
Mr.
Harley
still
mends
,
and
is
up
every
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
design
to
see
him
in
a
few
days
:
 
<EOS>
and
he
brings
me
word
too
that
he
has
found
out
Vedeau
's
brother
's
shop
:
 
<EOS>
I
shall
call
there
in
a
day
or
two
.
<EOS>
It
seems
the
wife
lodges
next
door
to
the
brother
.
 
<EOS>
I
doubt
the
scoundrel
was
broke
,
and
got
a
commission
,
or
perhaps
is
a
volunteer
gentleman
,
and
expects
to
get
one
by
his
valour
.
 
<EOS>
Morrow
,
sirrahs
,
let
me
rise
.
 
<EOS>
At
night
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
to
-
day
with
Sir
Thomas
Mansel
.
 
<EOS>
We
were
walking
in
the
Park
,
and
Mr.
Lewis
came
to
us
.
 
<EOS>
Mansel
asked
where
we
dined
.
 
<EOS>
We
said
,
"
Together
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
said
,
we
should
dine
with
him
,
only
his
wife
desired
him
to
bring
nobody
,
because
she
had
only
a
leg
of
mutton
.
 
<EOS>
I
said
I
would
dine
with
him
to
choose
;
but
he
would
send
a
servant
to
order
a
plate
or
two
:
 
yet
this
man
has
ten
thousand
pounds
a
year
in
land
,
and
is
a
Lord
of
the
Treasury
,
and
is
not
covetous
neither
,
but
runs
out
merely
by
slattering
and
negligence
.
 
<EOS>
The
worst
dinner
I
ever
saw
at
the
Dean
's
was
better
:
 
<EOS>
but
so
it
is
with
abundance
of
people
here
.
 
<EOS>
I
called
at
night
at
Mr.
Harley
's
,
who
begins
to
walk
in
his
room
with
a
stick
,
but
is
mighty
weak
.
 
<EOS>
See
how
much
I
have
lost
with
that
ugly
grease
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
your
fault
,
pray
;
and
I
'll
go
to
bed
.
  
<EOS>
April

.
 
<EOS>
The
Duke
of
Buckingham
's
house
fell
down
last
night
with
an
earthquake
,
and
is
half
swallowed
up
;
wo
n't
you
go
and
see
it
?
 
<EOS>
An
April
fool
,
an
April
fool
,
oh
ho
,
young
women
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
do
n't
be
angry
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
make
you
an
April
fool
no
more
till
the
next
time
;
we
had
no
sport
here
,
because
it
is
Sunday
,
and
Easter
Sunday
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
with
the
Secretary
,
who
seemed
terribly
down
and
melancholy
,
which
Mr.
Prior
and
Lewis
observed
as
well
as
I
:
 
<EOS>
perhaps
something
is
gone
wrong
;
perhaps
there
is
nothing
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
God
bless
my
own
dearest
MD
,
and
all
is
well
.
  
<EOS>

.
 
<EOS>
We
have
such
windy
weather
,
'
tis
troublesome
walking
,
yet
all
the
rabble
have
got
into
our
Park
these
Easter
holidays
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
plagued
with
one
Richardson
,
an
Irish
parson
,
and
his
project
of
printing
Irish
Bibles
,
etc
.
,
to
make
you
Christians
in
that
country
:
 
<EOS>
I
befriend
him
<EOS>
what
I
can
,
on
account
of
the
Archbishop
and
Bishop
of
Clogher
.
 
<EOS>
But
what
business
have
I
to
meddle
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
Do
not
you
remember
that
,
sirrah
Stella
?
<EOS>
what
was
that
about
,
when
you
thought
I
was
meddling
with
something
that
was
not
my
business
?
 
<EOS>
O
,
faith
<EOS>
,
you
are
an
impudent
slut
,
I
remember
your
doings
,
I
'll
never
forget
you
as
long
as
I
live
.
 
<EOS>
Lewis
and
I
dined
together
at
his
lodgings
.
 
<EOS>
But
where
's
the
answer
to
this
letter
of
MD
's
?
 
<EOS>
O
,
faith
,
Presto
,
you
must
think
of
that
.
 
<EOS>
Time
enough
,
says
saucy
Presto

<EOS>
I
was
this
morning
to
see
Mrs.
Barton
<EOS>
:
 
<EOS>
I
love
her
better
than
anybody
here
,
and
see
her
seldomer
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
really
now
,
so
it
often
happens
in
the
world
,
that
where
one
loves
a
body
best
 
pshah
,
pshah
,
you
are
so
silly
with
your
moral
observations
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
but
she
told
me
a
very
good
story
.
 
<EOS>
An
old
gentlewoman
died
here
two
months
ago
,
and
left
in
her
will
,
to
have
eight
men
and
eight
maids
bearers
,
who
should
have
two
guineas
apiece
,
ten
guineas
to
the
parson
for
a
sermon
,
and
two
guineas
to
the
clerk
.
 
<EOS>
But
bearers
,
parson
,
and
clerk
must
be
all
true
virgins
;
and
not
to
be
admitted
till
they
took
their
oaths
of
virginity
:
 
<EOS>
so
the
poor
woman
still
lies
unburied
,
and
so
must
do
till
the
general
resurrection
.
 
<EOS>
I
called
at
Mr.
Secretary
's
,
to
see
what
the
D
#
#
#
#
ailed
him
on
Sunday
.
 
<EOS>
I
made
him
a
very
proper
speech
;
told
him
I
observed
he
was
much
out
of
temper
;
that
I
did
not
expect
he
would
tell
me
the
cause
,
but
would
be
glad
to
see
he
was
in
better
;
and
one
thing
I
warned
him
of
,
never
to
appear
cold
to
me
,
for
I
would
not
be
treated
like
a
schoolboy
;
that
I
had
felt
too
much
of
that
in
my
life
already
(
meaning
from
Sir
William
Temple
)
;
that
I
expected
every
great
Minister
who
honoured
me
with
his
acquaintance
,
if
he
heard
or
saw
anything
to
my
disadvantage
,
would
let
me
know
it
in
plain
words
,
and
not
put
me
in
pain
to
guess
by
the
change
or
coldness
of
his
countenance
or
behaviour
;
for
it
was
what
I
would
hardly
bear
from
a
crowned
head
,
and
I
thought
no
subject
's
favour
was
worth
it
;
and
that
I
designed
to
let
my
Lord
Keeper
and
Mr.
Harley
know
the
same
thing
,
that
they
might
use
me
accordingly
.
 
<EOS>
He
took
all
right
;
said
I
had
reason
;
vowed
nothing
ailed
him
but
sitting
up
whole
nights
at
business
,
and
one
night
at
drinking
;
would
have
had
me
dine
with
him
and
Mrs.
Masham
's
brother
,
to
make
up
matters
;
but
I
would
not
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
,
but
I
would
not
.
 
<EOS>
But
indeed
I
was
engaged
with
my
old
friend
Rollinson
;
you
never
heard
of
him
before
.
  
<EOS>

<EOS>
I
sometimes
look
a
line
or
two
back
,
and
see
plaguy
mistakes
of
the
pen
;
how
do
you
get
over
them
?
 
<EOS>
You
are
puzzled
sometimes
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
I
think
what
I
said
to
Mr.
Secretary
was
right
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
remember
how
I
used
to
be
in
pain
when
Sir
William
Temple
would
look
cold
and
out
of
humour
for
three
or
four
days
,
and
I
used
to
suspect
a
hundred
reasons
?
 
<EOS>
I
have
plucked
up
my
spirit
since
then
,
faith
;
he
spoilt
a
fine
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
with
my
neighbour
Vanhomrigh
,
and
MD
,
poor
MD
,
at
home
on
a
loin
of
mutton
and
half
a
pint
of
wine
,
and
the
mutton
was
raw
,
poor
Stella
could
not
eat
,
poor
dear
rogue
,
and
Dingley
was
so
vexed
;
but
we
will
dine
at
Stoyte
's
to
-
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Harley
promised
to
see
me
in
a
day
or
two
,
so
I
called
this
evening
;
but
his
son
and
others
were
abroad
,
and
he
asleep
,
so
I
came
away
,
and
found
out
Mrs.
Vedeau
.
<EOS>
She
drew
out
a
letter
from
Dingley
,
and
said
she
would
get
a
friend
to
receive
the
money
.
 
<EOS>
I
told
her
I
would
employ
Mr.
Tooke
in
it
henceforward
.
 
<EOS>
Her
husband
bought
a
lieutenancy
of
foot
,
and
is
gone
to
Portugal
.
 
<EOS>
He
sold
his
share
of
the
shop
to
his
brother
,
and
put
out
the
money
to
maintain
her
,
all
<EOS>
but
what
bought
the
commission
.
 
<EOS>
She
lodges
within
two
doors
of
her
brother
.
<EOS>
She
told
me
it
made
her
very
melancholy
to
change
her
manner
of
life
thus
,
but
trade
was
dead
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
She
says
she
will
write
to
you
soon
.
 
<EOS>
I
design
to
engage
Ben
Tooke
,
and
then
receive
the
parchment
from
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
gave
Mr.
Dopping
a
copy
of
Prior
's
verses
on
Mr.
Harley
;
he
sent
them
yesterday
to
Ireland
,
so
go
look
for
them
,
for
I
wo
n't
be
at
the
trouble
to
transcribe
them
here
.
 
<EOS>
They
will
be
printed
in
a
day
or
two
.
 
<EOS>
Give
my
hearty
service
to
Stoyte
and
Catherine
:
upon
my
word
I
love
them
dearly
,
and
desire
you
will
tell
them
so
:
 
pray
desire
<EOS>
Goody
Stoyte
not
to
let
Mrs.
Walls
and
Mrs.
Johnson
cheat
her
of
her
money
at
ombre
,
but
assure
her
from
me
that
she
is
a
bungler
.
 
<EOS>
Dine
with
her
to
-
day
,
and
tell
her
so
,
and
drink
my
health
,
and
good
voyage
,
and
speedy
return
,
and
so
you
're
a
rogue
.

<EOS>
Morning
.
 
<EOS>
Now
let
us
proceed
to
examine
a
saucy
letter
from
one
Madam
MD
.
 
<EOS>
God
Almighty
bless
poor
dear
Stella
,
and
send
her
a
great
many
birthdays
,
all
happy
,
and
healthy
,
and
wealthy
,
and
with
me
ever
together
,
and
never
asunder
again
,
unless
by
chance
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
find
you
are
happy
or
merry
there
,
it
makes
me
so
here
,
and
I
can
hardly
imagine
you
absent
when
I
am
reading
your
letter
,
or
writing
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
faith
<EOS>
,
you
are
just
here
upon
this
little
paper
,
and
therefore
I
see
and
talk
with
you
every
evening
constantly
,
and
sometimes
in
the
morning
,
but
not
always
in
the
morning
,
because
that
is
not
so
modest
to
young
ladies
.
 
<EOS>
What
,
you
would
fain
palm
a
letter
on
me
more
than
you
sent
:
and
I
,
like
a
fool
,
must
look
over
all
yours
,
to
see
whether
this
was
really
N.12
,
or
more
.
<EOS>
[
Patrick
has
this
moment
brought
me
letters
from
the
Bishop
of
Clogher
and
Parvisol
;
my
heart
was
at
my
mouth
for
fear
of
one
from
MD
;
what
a
disgrace
would
it
be
to
have
two
of
yours
to
answer
together
!
 
<EOS>
But
,
faith
,
this
shall
go
to
-
night
,
for
fear
;
and
then
come
when
it
will
,
I
defy
it
.
]
 
<EOS>
No
,
you
are
not
naughty
at
all
,
write
when
you
are
disposed
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
the
Dean
told
you
the
story
of
Mr.
Harley
from
the
Archbishop
;
I
warrant
it
never
spoiled
your
supper
,
or
broke
off
your
game
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
yet
,
have
not
you
the
box
?
 
<EOS>
I
wish
Mrs.
Edgworth
had
the
.
 
<EOS>
But
you
have
it
now
,
I
suppose
;
and
is
the
chocolate
good
,
or
has
the
tobacco
spoilt
it
?
 
<EOS>
Leigh
stays
till
Sterne
has
done
his
business
,
no
longer
;
and
when
that
will
be
,
God
knows
:
 
I
befriend
him
as
much
as
I
can
,
but
Harley
's
accident
stops
that
as
well
as
all
things
else
.
 
<EOS>
You
guess
,
Madam
Dingley
,
that
I
shall
stay
a
round
twelvemonth
;
as
hope
saved
,
I
would
come
over
,
if
I
could
,
this
minute
;
but
we
will
talk
of
that
by
and
by
.
<EOS>
Your
affair
of
Vedeau
<EOS>
I
have
told
you
of
already
;
now
to
the
next
,
turn
over
the
leaf
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Dobbins
lies
,
I
have
no
more
provision
here
or
in
Ireland
than
I
had
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
pleased
that
Stella
the
conjurer
approves
what
I
did
with
Mr.
Harley
;
but
your
generosity
makes
me
mad
;
I
know
you
repine
inwardly
at
Presto
's
absence
;
you
think
he
has
broken
his
word
of
coming
in
three
months
,
and
that
this
is
always
his
trick
;
and
now
Stella
says
she
does
not
see
possibly
how
I
can
come
away
in
haste
,
and
that
MD
is
satisfied
,
etc
.
<EOS>
An't
you
a
rogue
to
overpower
me
thus
?
 
<EOS>
I
did
not
expect
to
find
such
friends
as
I
have
done
.
 
<EOS>
They
may
indeed
deceive
me
too
.
 
<EOS>
But
there
are
important
reasons[Pox
on
this
grease
,
this
candle
tallow
!
]
<EOS>
why
they
should
not
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
used
barbarously
by
the
late
Ministry
;
I
am
a
little
piqued
in
honour
to
let
people
see
I
am
not
to
be
despised
.
 
<EOS>
The
assurances
they
give
me
,
without
any
scruple
or
provocation
,
are
such
as
are
usually
believed
in
the
world
;
they
may
come
to
nothing
,
but
the
first
opportunity
that
offers
,
and
is
neglected
,
I
shall
depend
no
more
,
but
come
away
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
say
a
thousand
things
on
this
head
,
if
I
were
with
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
thinking
why
Stella
should
not
go
to
the
Bath
,
if
she
be
told
it
will
do
her
good
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
make
Parvisol
get
up
fifty
pounds
,
and
pay
it
you
;
and
you
may
be
good
housewives
,
and
live
cheap
there
some
months
,
and
return
in
autumn
,
or
visit
London
,
as
you
please
:
 
<EOS>
pray
think
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
writ
to
Bernage
,
directed
to
Curry
's
<EOS>
;
I
wish
he
had
the
letter
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
send
the
bohea
tea
,
if
I
can
.
 
<EOS>
The
Bishop
of
Kilmore
,
I
do
n't
keep
such
company
;
an
old
dying
fool
whom
I
never
was
with
in
my
life
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
am
no
godfather
;
all
the
better
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
,
Stella
,
explain
those
two
words
of
yours
to
me
,
what
you
mean
by
VILLIAN
and
DAINGER
;
and
you
,
Madam
Dingley
,
what
is
CHRISTIANING
?
 
<EOS>
Lay
your
letter
THIS
WAY
,
THIS
WAY
,
and
the
devil
a
bit
of
difference
between
this
way
and
the
other
way
.
 
<EOS>
No
;
I
will
show
you
,
lay
them
THIS
WAY
,
THIS
WAY
,
and
not
THAT
WAY
,
THAT
WAY
.
 
<EOS>
Y
ou
shall
have
your
aprons
;
and
I
will
put
all
your
commissions
as
they
come
,
in
a
paper
together
,
and
do
not
think
I
will
forget
MD
's
orders
,
because
they
are
friends
;
I
will
be
as
careful
as
if
they
were
strangers
.
 
<EOS>
I
knew
not
what
to
do
about
this
Clements
.
 
<EOS>
Walls
will
not
let
me
say
anything
as
if
Mr.
Pratt
was
against
him
;
and
now
the
Bishop
of
Clogher
has
written
to
me
in
his
behalf
.
 
<EOS>
This
thing
does
not
rightly
fall
in
my
way
,
and
that
people
never
consider
:
 
I
always
give
my
good
offices
where
they
are
proper
,
and
that
I
am
judge
of
;
however
,
I
will
do
what
I
can
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
if
he
has
the
name
of
a
Whig
,
it
will
be
hard
,
considering
my
Lord
Anglesea
and
Hyde
are
very
much
otherwise
,
and
you
know
they
have
the
employment
of
Deputy
Treasurer
.
 
<EOS>
If
the
frolic
should
take
you
of
going
to
the
Bath
,
I
here
send
you
a
note
on
Parvisol
;
if
not
,
you
may
tear
it
,
and
there
's
an
end
.
<EOS>
Farewell
.
  
<EOS>
If
you
have
an
imagination
that
the
Bath
will
do
you
good
,
I
say
again
,
I
would
have
you
go
;
if
not
,
or
it
be
inconvenient
,
burn
this
note
.
 
<EOS>
Or
,
if
you
would
go
,
and
not
take
so
much
money
,
take
thirty
pounds
,
and
I
will
return
you
twenty
from
hence
.
 
<EOS>
Do
as
you
please
,
sirrahs
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
it
will
not
be
too
late
for
the
first
season
;
if
it
be
,
I
would
have
you
resolve
however
to
go
the
second
season
,
if
the
doctors
say
it
will
do
you
good
,
and
you
fancy
so
.

LETTER

<EOS>
LONDON
,
April
5
,
1711
.
  
<EOS>
I
put
my
nineteenth
in
the
post
-
office
just
now
myself
,
as
I
came
out
of
the
City
,
where
I
dined
.
 
<EOS>
This
rain
ruins
me
in
coach
-
hire
;
I
walked
away
sixpennyworth
,
and
came
within
a
shilling
length
,
and
then
took
a
coach
,
and
got
a
lift
back
for
nothing
;
and
am
now
busy
.

<EOS>
Mr.
Secretary
desired
I
would
see
him
this
morning
;
said
he
had
several
things
to
say
to
me
,
and
said
not
one
;
and
the
Duke
of
Ormond
sent
to
desire
I
would
meet
him
at
Mr.
Southwell
's
by
ten
this
morning
too
,
which
I
did
,
thinking
it
was
some
particular
matter
.
 
<EOS>
All
the
Irish
in
town
were
there
,
to
consult
upon
preventing
a
Bill
for
laying
a
duty
on
Irish
yarn
;
so
we
talked
a
while
,
and
then
all
went
to
the
lobby
of
the
House
of
Commons
,
to
solicit
our
friends
,
and
the
Duke
came
among
the
rest
;
and
Lord
Anglesea
solicited
admirably
,
and
I
did
wonders
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
after
all
,
the
matter
was
put
off
till
Monday
,
and
then
we
are
to
be
at
it
again
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
with
Lord
Mountjoy
,
and
looked
over
him
at
chess
,
which
put
me
in
mind
of
Stella
and
Griffyth
.
 
<EOS>
I
came
home
,
and
that
dog
Patrick
was
not
within
;
so
I
fretted
,
and
fretted
,
and
<EOS>
what
good
did
that
do
me
?
       
<EOS>
And
so
get
you
gone
to
your
deans
,
     
You
couple
of
queans
.
  
<EOS>
I
can
not
find
rhyme
to
Walls
and
Stoyte
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
yes
,
       
You
expect
Mrs.
Walls
,
     
Be
dressed
when
she
calls
,
     
To
carry
you
to
Stoyte
,
     
Or
else
HONI
SOIT
.
  
<EOS>
Henley
told
me
that
the
Tories
were
insup
-
port
-
able
people
,
because
they
are
for
bringing
in
French
claret
,
and
will
not
SUP
-
PORT
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Harley
will
hardly
get
abroad
this
week
or
ten
days
yet
.
 
<EOS>
I
reckon
,
when
I
send
away
this
letter
,
he
will
be
just
got
into
the
House
of
Commons
.
 
<EOS>
My
last
letter
went
in
twelve
days
,
and
so
perhaps
may
this
.
 
<EOS>
No
it
wo
n't
,
for
those
letters
that
go
under
a
fortnight
<EOS>
are
answers
to
one
of
yours
<EOS>
,
otherwise
you
must
take
the
days
as
they
happen
,
some
dry
,
some
wet
,
some
barren
,
some
fruitful
,
some
merry
,
some
insipid
;
<EOS>
some
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
write
you
word
exactly
the
first
day
I
see
young
gooseberries
,
and
pray
observe
how
much
later
you
are
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
not
had
five
fine
days
this
five
weeks
,
but
rain
or
wind
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
a
late
spring

say
here

<EOS>
Go
to
bed

keep
me
up
all

Ford
has
been
at
Epsom
,
to
avoid
Good
Friday
and
Easter
Sunday
.
 
<EOS>
He
forced
me
to
-
day
to
dine
with
him
;
and
tells
me
there
are
letters
from
Ireland
,
giving
an
account
of
a
great
indiscretion
in
the
Archbishop
of
Dublin
,
who
applied
a
story
out
of
Tacitus
very
reflectingly
on
Mr.
Harley
,
and
that
twenty
people
have
written
of
it
;
I
do
not
believe
it
yet
.
 
<EOS>
I
called
this
evening
to
see
Mr.
Secretary
,
who
has
been
very
ill
with
the
gravel
and
pain
in
his
back
,
by
burgundy
and
champagne
,
<EOS>
added
to
the
sitting
up
all
night
at
business
;
I
found
him
drinking
tea
while
the
rest
were
at
champagne
,
and
was
very
glad
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
chid
him
so
severely
that
I
hardly
knew
whether
he
would
take
it
well
:
 
<EOS>
then
I
went
and
sat
an
hour
with
Mrs.
St.
John
,
who
is
growing
a
great
favourite
of
mine
;
she
goes
to
the
Bath
on
Wednesday
,
for
she
is
much
out
of
health
,
and
has
begged
me
to
take
care
of
the
Secretary
.

<EOS>
I
dined
to
-
day
with
Mr.
Secretary
St.
John
;
he
gave
me
a
letter
to
read
,
which
was
from
the
publisher
of
the
newspaper
called
the
Postboy
;
in
it
there
was
a
long
copy
of
a
letter
from
Dublin
,
giving
an
account
of
what
the
Whigs
said
upon
Mr.
Harley
's
being
stabbed
,
and
how
much
they
abuse
him
and
Mr.
Secretary
St.
John
;
and
at
the
end
there
were
half
a
dozen
lines
,
telling
the
story
of
the
Archbishop
of
Dublin
,
and
abusing
him
horribly
;
this
was
to
be
printed
on
Tuesday
.
 
<EOS>
I
told
the
Secretary
I
would
not
suffer
that
about
the
Archbishop
to
be
printed
,
and
so
I
crossed
it
out
;
and
afterwards
,
to
prevent
all
danger
,
I
made
him
give
me
the
letter
,
and
,
upon
further
thought
,
would
let
none
of
it
be
published
:
 
<EOS>
and
I
sent
for
the
printer
,
and
told
him
so
,
and
ordered
him
,
in
the
Secretary
's
name
,
to
print
nothing
reflecting
on
anybody
in
Ireland
till
he
had
showed
it
me
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
I
have
prevented
a
terrible
scandal
to
the
Archbishop
,
by
a
piece
of
perfect
good
fortune
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
let
him
know
it
by
next
post
;
and
pray
,
if
you
pick
it
out
,
let
me
know
,
and
whether
he
is
thankful
for
it
;
but
say
nothing
.

<EOS>
I
was
to
-
day
at
the
House
of
Commons
again
about
their
yarn
,
at
Lord
Anglesea
's
desire
;
but
the
business
is
again
put
off
till
Monday
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
with
Sir
John
Stanley
,
by
an
assignation
I
had
made
with
Mr.
St.
John
,
and
George
Granville
,
the
Secretary
at
War
;
<EOS>
but
they
let
in
other
company
,
some
ladies
,
and
<EOS>
so
we
were
not
so
easy
as
I
intended
.
 
<EOS>
My
head
is
pretty
tolerable
,
but
every
day
I
feel
some
little
disorders
;
I
have
left
off
snuff
since
Sunday
,
finding
myself
much
worse
after
taking
a
good
deal
at
the
Secretary
's
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
not
let
him
drink
one
drop
of
champagne
or
burgundy
without
water
,
and
in
compliment
I
did
so
myself
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
much
better
;
but
when
he
is
well
,
he
is
like
Stella
,
and
will
not
be
governed
.
 
<EOS>
So
go
to
your
Stoyte
's
,
and
I
'll
go
sleep
.
  
<EOS>

.
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
visiting
Lady
Worsley
and
Mrs.
Barton
today
,
and
dined
soberly
with
my
friend
Lewis
.
 
<EOS>
The
Dauphin
is
dead
of
an
apoplexy
;
I
wish
he
had
lived
till
the
finishing
of
this
letter
,
that
it
might
be
news
to
you
.
<EOS>
Duncombe
,
the
rich
alderman
,
died
to
-
day
,
and
I
hear
has
left
the
Duke
of
Argyle
,
who
married
his
niece
,
two
hundred
thousand
pounds
;
I
hope
it
is
true
,
for
I
love
that
Duke
mightily
.
 
<EOS>
I
writ
this
evening
to
the
Archbishop
of
Dublin
,
about
what
I
told
you
;
and
then
went
to
take
leave
of
poor
Mrs.
St.
John
,
who
gave
me
strict
charge
to
take
care
of
the
Secretary
in
her
absence
;
said
she
had
none
to
trust
but
me
;
and
the
poor
creature
's
tears
came
fresh
in
her
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
Before
we
took
leave
,
I
was
drawn
in
by
the
other
ladies
and
Sir
John
Stanley
to
raffle
for
a
fan
,
with
a
pox
;
it
was
four
guineas
,
and
we
put
in
seven
shillings
apiece
,
several
raffling
for
absent
people
;
but
I
lost
,
and
so
missed
an
opportunity
of
showing
my
gallantry
to
Mrs.
St.
John
,
whom
I
designed
to
have
presented
it
to
if
I
had
won
.
 
<EOS>
Is
Dilly
gone
to
the
Bath
?
<EOS>
His
face
will
whizz
in
the
water
;
I
suppose
he
will
write
to
us
from
thence
,
and
will
take
London
in
his
way
back
.
 
<EOS>
The
rabble
will
say
,
"
There
goes
a
drunken
parson
"
;
and
,
which
is
worse
,
they
will
say
true
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
but
you
must
know
I
carried
Ford
to
dine
with
Mr.
St.
John
last
Sunday
,
that
he
may
brag
,
when
he
goes
back
,
of
dining
with
a
Secretary
of
State
.
 
<EOS>
The
Secretary
<EOS>
and
I
went
away
early
,
and
left
him
drinking
with
the
rest
,
and
he
told
me
that
two
or
three
of
them
were
drunk
.
 
<EOS>
They
talk
of
great
promotions
to
be
made
;
that
Mr.
Harley
is
to
be
Lord
Treasurer
,
and
Lord
Poulett
Master
of
the
Horse
,
etc
.
,
but
they
are
only
conjecture
.
 
<EOS>
The
Speaker
is
to
make
Mr.
Harley
a
compliment
the
first
time
he
comes
into
the
House
,
which
I
hope
will
be
in
a
week
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
had
an
ill
surgeon
,
by
the
caprice
of
that
puppy
Dr.
Radcliffe
,
which
has
kept
him
back
so
long
;
and
yesterday
he
got
a
cold
,
but
is
better
to
-
day
.
 
<EOS>
What
!
<EOS>
I
think
I
am
stark
mad
,
to
write
so
much
in
one
day
to
little
saucy
MD
;
here
is
a
deal
of
stuff
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
ca
n't
you
bid
those
little
dear
rogues
good
-
night
,
and
let
them
go
sleep
,
Mr.
Presto
?
 
<EOS>
When
your
tongue
runs
there
's
no
ho
with
you
,
pray
.
  
<EOS>
11
.
 
<EOS>
Again
at
the
lobby
(
like
a
lobcock
)
of
the
House
of
Commons
,
about
your
Irish
yarn
,
and
again
put
off
till
Friday
;
and
I
and
Patrick
went
into
the
City
by
water
,
where
I
dined
,
and
then
I
went
to
the
auction
of
Charles
Barnard
's
books
;
but
the
good
ones
were
so
monstrous
<EOS>
dear
<EOS>
,
I
could
not
reach
them
,
so
I
laid
out
one
pound
seven
shillings
but
very
indifferently
,
and
came
away
,
and
will
go
there
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
Henley
would
fain
engage
me
to
go
with
Steele
and
Rowe
,
etc
.
,
to
an
invitation
at
Sir
William
Read
's
.
 
<EOS>
Surely
you
have
heard
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
been
a
mountebank
,
and
is
the
Queen
's
oculist
;
he
makes
admirable
punch
,
and
treats
you
in
gold
vessels
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
am
engaged
,
and
will
not
go
,
neither
indeed
am
I
fond
of
the
jaunt
.
 
<EOS>
So
good
-
night
,
and
go
sleep
.
  
<EOS>
12
.
 
<EOS>
I
went
about
noon
to
the
Secretary
,
who
is
very
ill
with
a
cold
,
and
sometimes
of
the
gravel
,
with
his
champagne
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
I
scolded
him
like
a
dog
,
and
he
promises
faithfully
more
care
for
the
future
.
 
<EOS>
To
-
day
<EOS>
my
Lord
Anglesea
,
and
Sir
Thomas
Hammer
,
and
Prior
,
and
I
dined
,
by
appointment
,
with
Lieutenant
-
General
Webb
.
 
<EOS>
My
lord
and
I
stayed
till
ten
o'clock
;
but
we
drank
soberly
,
and
I
always
with
water
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
with
us
one
Mr.
Campain
,
one
of
the
October
Club
,
if
you
know
what
that
is
;
a
Club
of
country
members
,
who
think
the
Ministers
are
too
backward
in
punishing
and
turning
out
the
Whigs
.
 
<EOS>
I
found
my
lord
and
the
rest
thought
I
had
more
credit
with
the
Ministry
than
I
pretend
to
have
,
and
would
have
engaged
me
to
put
them
upon
something
that
would
satisfy
their
desires
,
and
indeed
I
think
they
have
some
reason
to
complain
;
however
,
I
will
not
burn
my
fingers
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
remember
Stella
's
chiding
,
"
What
had
you
to
do
with
what
did
not
belong
to
you
?
"
<EOS>
etc
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
you
will
give
me
leave
to
tell
the
Ministry
my
thoughts
when
they
ask
them
,
and
other
people
's
thoughts
sometimes
when
they
do
not
ask
;
so
thinks
Dingley
.
  
<EOS>
13
.
 
<EOS>
I
called
this
morning
at
Mrs.
Vedeau
's
again
,
who
has
employed
a
friend
to
get
the
money
;
it
will
be
done
in
a
fortnight
,
and
then
she
will
deliver
me
up
the
parchment
.
 
<EOS>
I
went
then
to
see
Mr.
Harley
,
who
I
hope
will
be
out
in
a
few
days
;
he
was
in
excellent
good
humour
,
only
complained
to
me
of
the
neglect
of
Guiscard
's
cure
,
<EOS>
how
glad
he
would
have
been
to
have
had
him
live
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Secretary
came
in
to
us
,
and
we
were
very
merry
till
Lord
Chamberlain
(
Duke
of
Shrewsbury
)
came
up
;
then
Colonel
Masham
and
I
went
off
,
after
I
had
been
presented
to
the
Duke
,
and
that
we
made
two
or
three
silly
compliments
suitable
to
the
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
Then
I
attended
at
the
House
of
Commons
about
your
yarn
,
and
it
is
again
put
off
.
 
<EOS>
Then
Ford
drew
me
to
dine
at
a
tavern
;
it
happened
to
be
the
day
and
the
house
where
the
October
Club
dine
.
<EOS>
After
we
had
dined
,
coming
down
<EOS>
we
called
to
inquire
whether
our
yarn
business
had
been
over
that
day
,
and
I
sent
into
the
room
for
Sir
George
Beaumont
.
<EOS>
But
I
had
like
to
be
drawn
into
a
difficulty
;
for
in
two
minutes
out
comes
Mr.
Finch
,
Lord
Guernsey
's
son
,
to
let
me
know
that
my
Lord
Compton
,
the
steward
of
this
feast
,
desired
,
in
the
name
of
the
Club
,
that
I
would
do
them
the
honour
to
dine
with
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
sent
my
excuses
,
adorned
with
about
thirty
compliments
,
and
got
off
as
fast
as
I
could
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
have
been
a
most
improper
thing
for
me
to
dine
there
,
considering
my
friendship
with
the
Ministry
.
 
<EOS>
The
Club
is
about
a
hundred
and
fifty
,
and
near
eighty
of
them
were
then
going
to
dinner
at
two
long
tables
in
a
great
ground
-
room
.
 
<EOS>
At
evening
I
went
to
the
auction
of
Barnard
's
books
,
and
laid
out
three
pounds
three
shillings
,
but
I
'll
go
there
no
more
;
and
<EOS>
so
I
said
once
before
,
<EOS>
but
now
I
'll
keep
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
forgot
to
tell
that
when
I
dined
at
Webb
's
with
Lord
Anglesea
,
I
spoke
to
him
of
Clements
,
as
one
recommended
for
a
very
honest
gentleman
and
good
officer
,
and
hoped
he
would
keep
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
said
he
had
not
thought
otherwise
,
and
that
he
should
certainly
hold
his
place
while
he
continued
to
deserve
it
;
and
I
could
not
find
there
had
been
any
intentions
from
his
lordship
against
him
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
tell
you
,
hunny
,
the
impropriety
of
this
.
 
<EOS>
A
great
man
will
do
a
favour
for
me
,
or
for
my
friend
;
but
why
should
he
do
it
for
my
friend
's
friend
?
 
<EOS>
Recommendations
should
stop
before
they
come
to
that
.
<EOS>
Let
any
friend
of
mine
recommend
one
of
his
to
me
for
a
thing
in
my
power
,
I
will
do
it
for
his
sake
;
but
to
speak
to
another
for
my
friend
's
friend
is
against
all
reason
;
and
I
desire
you
will
understand
this
,
and
discourage
any
such
troubles
given
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
this
may
do
some
good
to
Clements
<EOS>
,
it
can
do
him
no
hurt
;
and
I
find
by
Mrs.
Pratt
,
that
her
husband
is
his
friend
;
and
the
Bishop
of
Clogher
says
Clements
's
danger
is
not
from
Pratt
,
but
from
some
other
enemies
,
that
think
him
a
Whig
.
  
<EOS>
14
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
so
busy
this
morning
that
I
did
not
go
out
till
late
.
 
<EOS>
I
writ
to
-
day
to
the
Duke
of
Argyle
,
but
said
nothing
of
Bernage
,
who
,
I
believe
,
will
not
see
him
till
Spain
is
conquered
,
and
that
is
,
not
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
to
-
day
at
Lord
Shelburne
's
,
and
spoke
to
Mrs.
Pratt
again
about
Clements
;
her
husband
himself
wants
some
good
offices
,
and
I
have
done
him
very
good
ones
lately
,
and
told
Mrs.
Pratt
I
expected
her
husband
should
stand
by
Clements
in
return
.
<EOS>
Sir
Andrew
Fountaine
and
I
dined
with
neighbour
Vanhomrigh
;
he
is
mighty
ill
of
an
asthma
,
and
apprehends
himself
in
much
danger
;
'
tis
his
own
fault
,
that
will
rake
and
drink
,
when
he
is
but
just
crawled
out
of
his
grave
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
send
this
letter
just
now
,
because
I
think
my
half
-
year
is
out
for
my
lodging
;
and
,
if
you
please
,
I
would
be
glad
it
were
paid
off
,
and
some
deal
boxes
made
for
my
books
,
and
kept
in
some
safe
place
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
give
something
for
their
keeping
:
 
<EOS>
but
I
doubt
that
lodging
will
not
serve
me
when
I
come
back
;
I
would
have
a
larger
place
for
books
,
and
a
stable
,
if
possible
.
 
<EOS>
So
pray
be
so
kind
to
pay
the
lodging
,
and
all
accounts
about
it
;
and
get
Mrs.
Brent
to
put
up
my
things
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
have
no
books
put
in
that
trunk
where
my
papers
are
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
do
not
think
of
going
to
the
Bath
,
I
here
send
you
a
bill
on
Parvisol
for
twenty
pounds
Irish
,
out
of
which
you
will
pay
for
the
lodging
,
and
score
the
rest
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
Do
as
you
please
,
and
love
poor
Presto
,
that
loves
MD
better
than
his
life
a
thousand
millions
of
times
.
 
<EOS>
Farewell

etc

LETTER
21
.
 
<EOS>
LONDON
,
April
14
,
1711
.
  
<EOS>
Remember
,
sirrahs
,
that
there
are
but
nine
days
between
the
dates
of
my
two
former
letters
.
 
<EOS>
I
sent
away
my
twentieth
this
moment
,
and
now
am
writing
on
like
a
fish
,
as
if
nothing
was
done
.
 
<EOS>
But
there
was
a
cause
for
my
hasting
away
the
last
,
<EOS>
for
fear
it
should
not
come
time
enough
before
a
new
quarter
began
.
 
<EOS>
I
told
you
where
I
dined
to
-
day
;
but
forgot
to
tell
you
what
I
believe
,
that
Mr.
Harley
will
be
Lord
Treasurer
in
a
short
time
,
and
other
great
removes
and
promotions
made
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
my
thought
,
etc
.
  
<EOS>
15
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
this
morning
with
Mr.
Secretary
,
and
he
is
grown
pretty
well
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
with
him
to
-
day
,
and
drank
some
of
that
wine
which
the
Duke
of
Tuscany
used
to
send
to
Sir
William
Temple
:
 
he
always
sends
some
to
the
chief
Ministers
.
 
<EOS>
I
liked
it
mightily
,
but
he
does
not
;
and
he
ordered
his
butler
to
send
me
a
chest
of
it
to
-
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
Would
to
God
MD
had
it
!
 
<EOS>
The
Queen
is
well
again
,
and
was
at
chapel
to
-
day
,
etc
.
  
<EOS>
16
.
 
<EOS>
I
went
with
Ford
into
the
City
to
-
day
,
and
dined
with
Stratford
,
and
drank
Tokay
,
and
then
we
went
to
the
auction
;
but
I
did
not
lay
out
above
twelve
shillings
.
 
<EOS>
My
head
is
a
little
out
of
order
<EOS>
to
-
night
,
though
no
formal
fit
.
 
<EOS>
My
Lord
Keeper
has
sent
to
invite
me
to
dinner
to
-
morrow
,
and
you
'll
dine
better
with
the
Dean
;
and
God
bless
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
forgot
to
tell
you
that
yesterday
was
sent
me
a
Narrative
printed
,
with
all
the
circumstances
of
Mr.
Harley
's
stabbing
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
not
time
to
do
it
myself
;
so
I
sent
my
hints
to
the
author
of
the
Atalantis
,
and
she
has
cooked
it
into
a
sixpenny
pamphlet
,
in
her
own
style
,
only
the
first
page
is
left
as
I
was
beginning
it
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
was
afraid
of
disobliging
Mr.
Harley
or
Mr.
St.
John
in
one
critical
point
about
it
,
and
so
would
not
do
it
myself
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
worth
your
reading
,
for
the
circumstances
are
all
true
.
 
<EOS>
My
chest
of
Florence
was
sent
me
this
morning
,
and
cost
me
seven
and
sixpence
to
two
servants
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
give
two
guineas
you
had
it
,
etc
.
  
<EOS>
17
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
so
out
of
order
with
my
head
this
morning
,
that
I
was
going
to
send
my
excuses
to
my
Lord
Keeper
;
but
however
I
got
up
at
eleven
,
and
walked
there
after
two
,
and
stayed
till
eight
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
Sir
Thomas
Mansel
,
Prior
,
George
Granville
,
and
Mr.
Caesar
,
and
we
were
very
merry
.
 
<EOS>
My
head
is
still
wrong
,
but
I
have
had
no
formal
fit
,
only
I
totter
a
little
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
left
off
snuff
altogether
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
noble
roll
of
tobacco
for
grating
,
very
good
.
 
<EOS>
Shall
I
send
it
to
MD
,
if
she
likes
that
sort
?
 
<EOS>
My
Lord
Keeper
and
our
this
day
's
company
are
to
dine
on
Saturday
with
George
Granville
,
and
to
-
morrow
I
dine
with
Lord
Anglesea
.
  
<EOS>
18
.
 
<EOS>
Did
you
ever
see
such
a
blundering
goosecap
as
Presto
?
 
<EOS>
I
saw
the
number
21
at
top
,
and
so
I
went
on
as
if
it
were
the
day
of
the
month
,
whereas
this
is
but
Wednesday
the
18th
.
 
<EOS>
How
shall
I
do
to
blot
and
alter
them
?
 
<EOS>
I
have
made
a
shift
to
do
it
behind
,
but
it
is
a
great
botch
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
with
Lord
Anglesea
to
-
day
,
but
did
not
go
to
the
House
of
Commons
about
the
yarn
;
my
head
was
not
well
enough
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
not
what
is
the
matter
;
it
has
never
been
thus
before
:
 
two
days
together
giddy
from
morning
till
night
,
but
not
with
any
violence
or
pain
;
and
I
totter
a
little
,
but
can
make
shift
to
walk
.
 
<EOS>
I
doubt
I
must
fall
to
my
pills
again
:
 
<EOS>
I
think
of
going
into
the
country
a
little
way
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
you
what
you
must
do
henceforward
:
 
you
must
enclose
your
letter
in
a
fair
half
-
sheet
of
paper
,
and
direct
the
outside
"
To
Erasmus
Lewis
,
Esquire
,
at
my
Lord
Dartmouth
's
office
at
Whitehall
"
:
 
<EOS>
for
I
never
go
to
the
Coffee
-
house
,
and
they
will
grudge
to
take
in
my
letters
.
 
<EOS>
I
forgot
to
tell
you
that
your
mother
was
to
see
me
this
morning
,
and
brought
me
a
flask
of
sweet
-
water
for
a
present
,
admirable
for
my
head
;
but
I
shall
not
smell
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
She
is
going
to
Sheen
,
with
Lady
Giffard
:
 
<EOS>
she
would
fain
send
your
papers
over
to
you
,
or
give
them
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
Say
what
you
would
have
done
,
and
it
shall
be
done
;
because
I
love
Stella
,
and
she
is
a
good
daughter
,
they
say
,
and
so
is
Dingley
.
  
<EOS>

<EOS>
This
morning
General
Webb
was
to
give
me
a
visit
:
 
<EOS>
he
goes
with
a
crutch
and
stick
,
yet
was
forced
to
come
up
two
pair
of
stairs
.
 
<EOS>
I
promised
to
dine
with
him
,
but
afterwards
sent
my
excuses
,
and
dined
privately
in
my
friend
Lewis
's
lodgings
at
Whitehall
,
with
whom
I
had
much
business
to
talk
of
,
relating
to
the
public
and
myself
.
 
<EOS>
Little
Harrison
the
Tatler
goes
to
-
morrow
to
the
secretaryship
I
got
him
at
the
Hague
,
and
Mr.
St.
John
has
made
him
a
present
of
fifty
guineas
to
bear
his
charges
.
 
<EOS>
An't
<EOS>
I
a
good
friend
?
 
<EOS>
Why
are
not
you
a
young
fellow
,
that
I
might
prefer
you
?
 
<EOS>
I
had
a
letter
from
Bernage
from
Kinsale
:
 
<EOS>
he
tells
me
his
commission
for
captain
-
lieutenant
was
ready
for
him
at
his
arrival
:
 
<EOS>
so
there
are
two
jackanapeses
I
have
done
with
.
 
<EOS>
My
head
is
something
better
this
evening
,
though
not
well
.
  
<EOS>
20
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
this
morning
with
Mr.
Secretary
,
whose
packets
were
just
come
in
,
and
among
them
a
letter
from
Lord
Peterborow
to
me
:
 
<EOS>
he
writes
so
well
,
I
have
no
mind
to
answer
him
,
and
so
kind
,
that
I
must
answer
him
.
 
<EOS>
The
Emperor
's
death
must
,
I
think
,
cause
great
alterations
in
Europe
,
and
,
I
believe
,
will
hasten
a
peace
.
 
<EOS>
We
reckon
our
King
Charles
will
be
chosen
Emperor
,
and
the
Duke
of
Savoy
set
up
for
Spain
;
but
I
believe
he
will
make
nothing
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
Dr.
Freind
and
<EOS>
I
dined
in
the
City
at
a
printer
's
,
and
it
has
cost
me
two
shillings
in
coach
-
hire
,
and
a
great
deal
more
this
week
and
month
,
which
has
been
almost
all
rain
,
with
now
and
then
sunshine
,
and
is
the
truest
April
that
I
have
known
these
many
years
.
 
<EOS>
The
lime
-
trees
in
the
Park
are
all
out
in
leaves
,
though
not
large
leaves
yet
.
 
<EOS>
Wise
people
are
going
into
the
country
;
but
many
think
the
Parliament
can
hardly
be
up
these
six
weeks
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Harley
was
with
the
Queen
on
Tuesday
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
certainly
he
will
be
Lord
Treasurer
<EOS>
:
I
have
not
seen
him
this
week
.
  
<EOS>
21
.
 
<EOS>
Morning
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Keeper
,
and
I
,
and
Prior
,
and
Sir
Thomas
Mansel
,
have
appointed
to
dine
this
day
with
George
Granville
.
 
<EOS>
My
head
,
I
thank
God
,
is
better
;
but
to
be
giddyish
three
or
four
days
together
mortified
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
take
no
snuff
,
and
I
will
be
very
regular
in
eating
little
and
the
gentlest
meats
.
<EOS>
How
does
poor
Stella
just
now
,
with
her
deans
and
her
Stoytes
?
 
<EOS>
Do
they
give
you
health
for
the
money
you
lose
at
ombre
,
sirrah
?
 
<EOS>
What
say
you
to
that
?
<EOS>
Poor
Dingley
frets
to
see
Stella
lose
that
four
and
elevenpence
,
the
other
night
.
 
<EOS>
Let
us
rise
.
 
<EOS>
Morrow
,
sirrahs
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
rise
,
spite
of
your
little
teeth
;
good
-
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
At
night
.
 
<EOS>
O
,
faith
,
you
are
little
dear
saucyboxes
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
just
going
in
the
morning
to
tell
you
that
I
began
to
want
a
letter
from
MD
,
and
in
four
minutes
after
Mr.
Ford
sends
me
one
that
he
had
picked
up
at
St.
James
's
Coffee
-
house
;
for
I
go
to
no
coffee
-
house
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
And
,
faith
,
I
was
glad
at
heart
to
see
it
,
and
to
see
Stella
so
brisk
.
 
<EOS>
O
Lord
,
what
pretending
?
 
<EOS>
Well
,
but
I
will
not
answer
it
yet
;
I
'll
keep
it
for
t'other
side
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
we
dined
to
-
day
according
to
appointment
:
 
Lord
Keeper
went
away
at
near
eight
,
I
at
eight
,
and
I
believe
the
rest
will
be
fairly
fuddled
;
for
young
Harcourt
,
Lord
Keeper
's
son
,
began
to
prattle
before
I
came
away
.
 
<EOS>
It
will
not
do
with
Prior
's
lean
carcass
.
 
<EOS>
I
drink
little
,
miss
my
glass
often
,
put
water
in
my
wine
,
and
go
away
before
the
rest
,
which
I
take
to
be
a
good
receipt
for
sobriety
.
 
<EOS>
Let
us
put
it
into
rhyme
,
and
so
make
a
proverb
        
Drink
little
at
a
time
;
     
Put
water
with
your
wine
;
     
Miss
your
glass
<EOS>
when
you
can
;
     
And
go
off
the
first
man
.
  
<EOS>
God
be
thanked
,
I
am
much
better
than
I
was
,
though
something
of
a
totterer
.
<EOS>
I
ate
but
little
to
-
day
,
and
of
the
gentlest
meat
.
 
<EOS>
I
refused
ham
and
pigeons
,
pease
-
soup
,
stewed
beef
,
cold
salmon
,
because
they
were
too
strong
.
 
<EOS>
I
take
no
snuff
at
all
,
but
some
herb
snuff
prescribed
by
Dr.
Radcliffe
.
       
<EOS>
Go
to
your
deans
,
     
You
couple
of
queans
.
  
<EOS>
I
believe
I
said
that
already
.
 
<EOS>
What
care
I
?
 
<EOS>
what
cares
Presto
?
  
<EOS>
22
.
 
<EOS>
Morning
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
rise
and
go
to
the
Secretary
's
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Harley
has
been
out
of
town
this
week
to
refresh
himself
before
he
comes
into
Parliament
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
but
I
must
rise
,
so
there
is
no
more
to
be
said
;
and
so
morrow
,
sirrahs
both
.
  
<EOS>
Night
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
to
-
day
with
the
Secretary
,
who
has
engaged
me
for
every
Sunday
;
and
I
was
an
hour
with
him
this
morning
deep
in
politics
,
where
I
told
him
the
objections
of
the
October
Club
,
and
he
answered
all
except
one
,
that
no
inquiries
are
made
into
past
mismanagement
.
 
<EOS>
But
indeed
I
believe
they
are
not
yet
able
to
make
any
:
 
<EOS>
the
late
Ministry
were
too
cunning
in
their
rogueries
,
and
fenced
themselves
with
an
Act
of
general
pardon
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
Mr.
Harley
must
be
Lord
Treasurer
;
yet
he
makes
one
difficulty
which
is
hard
to
answer
:
 
<EOS>
he
must
be
made
a
lord
,
and
his
estate
is
not
large
enough
,
and
he
is
too
generous
to
make
it
larger
;
and
if
the
Ministry
should
change
soon
by
any
accident
,
he
will
be
left
in
the
suds
.
 
<EOS>
Another
difficulty
is
,
that
if
he
be
made
a
peer
,
they
will
want
him
prodigiously
in
the
House
of
Commons
,
of
which
he
is
the
great
mover
,
and
after
him
the
Secretary
,
and
hardly
any
else
of
weight
.
 
<EOS>
Two
shillings
more
to
-
day
for
coach
and
chair
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
be
ruined
.
  
<EOS>
23
.
 
<EOS>
So
you
expect
an
answer
to
your
letter
,
do
you
so
?
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
yes
,
you
shall
have
an
answer
,
you
shall
,
young
women
.
 
<EOS>
I
made
a
good
pun
on
Saturday
to
my
Lord
Keeper
.
 
<EOS>
After
dinner
we
had
coarse
Doiley
napkins
,
fringed
at
each
end
,
upon
the
table
,
to
drink
with
:
 
my
Lord
Keeper
spread
one
of
them
between
him
and
Mr.
Prior
;
I
told
him
I
was
glad
to
see
there
was
such
a
fringeship
[
friendship
]
between
Mr.
Prior
and
his
lordship
.
 
<EOS>
Prior
swore
it
was
the
worst
he
ever
heard
:
 
<EOS>
I
said
I
thought
so
too
;
but
at
the
same
time
I
thought
it
was
most
like
one
of
Stella
's
that
<EOS>
ever
I
heard
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
to
-
day
with
Lord
Mountjoy
,
and
this
evening
saw
the
Venetian
Ambassador
coming
from
his
first
public
audience
.
 
<EOS>
His
coach
was
the
most
monstrous
,
huge
,
fine
,
rich
gilt
thing
that
ever
I
saw
.
 
<EOS>
I
loitered
this
evening
,
and
came
home
late
.
  
<EOS>
24
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
this
morning
to
visit
the
Duchess
of
Ormond
,
who
has
long
desired
it
,
or
threatened
she
would
not
let
me
visit
her
daughters
.
 
<EOS>
I
sat
an
hour
with
her
,
and
we
were
good
company
,
when
in
came
the
Countess
of
Bellamont
,
with
a
pox
.
 
<EOS>
I
went
out
,
and
we
did
not
know
one
another
;
yet
hearing
me
named
<EOS>
,
she
asked
,
"
What
,
is
that
Dr.
Swift
?
"
said
she
and
I
were
very
well
acquainted
,
and
fell
a
railing
at
me
without
mercy
,
as
a
lady
told
me
that
was
there
;
yet
I
never
was
but
once
in
the
company
of
that
drab
of
a
Countess
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
Andrew
Fountaine
and
I
dined
with
my
neighbour
Van
.
 
<EOS>
I
design
in
two
days
,
if
possible
,
to
go
lodge
at
Chelsea
for
the
air
,
and
put
myself
under
a
necessity
of
walking
to
and
from
London
every
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
writ
this
post
to
the
Bishop
of
Clogher
a
long
politic
letter
,
to
entertain
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
to
buy
statues
and
harnese
for
them
,
with
a
vengeance
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
packed
and
sealed
up
<EOS>
MD
's
twelve
letters
against
I
go
to
Chelsea
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
put
the
last
commissions
of
MD
in
my
account
-
book
;
but
if
there
be
any
former
ones
,
I
have
forgot
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
Dingley
's
pocket
-
book
down
,
and
Stella
's
green
silk
apron
,
and
the
pound
of
tea
;
pray
send
me
word
if
you
have
any
other
,
and
down
they
shall
go
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
not
answer
your
letter
yet
,
saucy
boxes
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
with
the
Dean
just
now
,
Madam
Stella
,
losing
your
money
.
 
<EOS>
Why
do
not
you
name
what
number
you
have
received
?
 
<EOS>
You
say
you
have
received
my
letters
,
but
do
not
tell
the
number
.

I
was
this
day
dining
in
the
City
with
very
insignificant
,
low
,
and
scurvy
company
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
a
letter
from
the
Archbishop
of
Dublin
,
with
a
long
denial
of
the
report
raised
on
him
,
which
yet
has
been
since
assured
to
me
from
those
who
say
they
have
it
from
the
first
hand
;
but
I
can
not
believe
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
show
it
to
the
Secretary
to
-
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
not
answer
yours
till
I
get
to
Chelsea
.
  
<EOS>
26
.
 
<EOS>
Chelsea
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
sent
two
boxes
of
lumber
to
my
friend
Darteneuf
's
house
,
and
my
chest
of
Florence
and
other
things
to
Mrs.
Vanhomrigb
,
where
I
dined
to
-
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
this
morning
with
the
Secretary
,
and
showed
him
the
Archbishop
's
letter
,
and
convinced
him
of
his
Grace
's
innocence
,
and
I
will
do
the
same
to
Mr.
Harley
.
 
<EOS>
I
got
here
in
the
stage
-
coach
with
Patrick
and
my
portmanteau
for
sixpence
,
and
pay
six
shillings
a
week
for
one
silly
room
with
confounded
coarse
sheets
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
had
such
a
horrible
deal
of
rain
,
that
there
is
no
walking
to
London
,
and
I
must
go
as
I
came
until
it
mends
;
and
besides
the
whelp
has
taken
my
lodging
as
far
from
London
as
this
town
could
afford
,
at
least
half
a
mile
farther
than
he
need
;
but
I
must
be
content
.
 
<EOS>
The
best
is
,
I
lodge
just
over
against
Dr.
Atterbury
's
house
,
and
yet
perhaps
I
shall
not
like
the
place
the
better
for
that
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
I
will
stay
till
to
-
morrow
before
I
answer
your
letter
;
and
you
must
suppose
me
always
writing
at
Chelsea
from
henceforward
,
till
I
alter
,
and
say
London
.
 
<EOS>
This
letter
goes
on
Saturday
,
which
will
be
just
a
fortnight
;
so
go
and
cheat
Goody
Stoyte
,
etc
.
  
<EOS>
27
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
know
that
I
fear
my
whole
chest
of
Florence
is
turned
sour
,
at
least
the
two
first
flasks
were
so
,
and
hardly
drinkable
.
 
<EOS>
How
plaguy
unfortunate
am
I
!
<EOS>
and
the
Secretary
's
own
is
the
best
I
ever
tasted
;
and
I
must
not
tell
him
,
but
be
as
thankful
as
if
it
were
the
best
in
Christendom
.
<EOS>
I
went
to
town
in
the
sixpenny
stage
to
-
day
;
and
hearing
Mr.
Harley
was
not
at
home
,
I
went
to
see
him
,
because
I
knew
by
the
message
of
his
lying
porter
that
he
was
at
home
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
very
well
,
and
just
going
out
,
but
made
me
promise
to
dine
with
him
;
and
betwixt
that
and
indeed
strolling
about
,
I
lost
four
pound
seven
shillings
at
play
 
with
a####a####a
#
#
#
#
bookseller
,
and
got
but
about
half
a
dozen
books
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
buy
no
more
books
now
<EOS>
,
that
's
certain
.
<EOS>
Well
,
I
dined
at
Mr.
Harley
's
,
came
away
at
six
,
shifted
my
gown
,
cassock
,
and
periwig
,
and
walked
hither
to
Chelsea
,
as
I
always
design
to
do
when
it
is
fair
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
heartily
sorry
to
find
my
friend
the
Secretary
stand
a
little
ticklish
with
the
rest
of
the
Ministry
;
there
have
been
one
or
two
disobliging
things
that
have
happened
,
too
long
to
tell
:
 
and
t'other
day
in
Parliament
,
upon
a
debate
of
about
thirty
-
five
millions
that
have
not
been
duly
accounted
for
,
Mr.
Secretary
,
in
his
warmth
of
speech
,
and
zeal
for
his
friend
Mr.
Brydges
,
on
whom
part
of
the
blame
was
falling
,
said
he
did
not
know
that
either
Mr.
Brydges
or
the
late
Ministry
were
at
all
to
blame
in
this
matter
;
which
was
very
desperately
spoken
,
and
giving
up
the
whole
cause
:
 
for
the
chief
quarrel
against
the
late
Ministry
was
the
ill
management
of
the
treasure
,
and
was
more
than
all
the
rest
together
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
heard
of
this
matter
:
 
but
Mr.
Foley
beginning
to
discourse
to
-
day
at
table
,
without
naming
Mr.
St.
John
<EOS>
,
I
turned
to
Mr.
Harley
,
and
said
if
the
late
Ministry
were
not
to
blame
in
that
article
,
he
(
Mr.
Harley
)
ought
to
lose
his
head
for
putting
the
Queen
upon
changing
them
.
 
<EOS>
He
made
it
a
jest
;
but
by
some
words
dropped
,
I
easily
saw
that
they
take
things
ill
of
Mr.
St.
John
;
and
by
some
hints
given
me
from
another
hand
that
I
deal
with
,
I
am
afraid
the
Secretary
will
not
stand
long
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
the
fate
of
Courts
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
,
if
I
meet
Mr.
St.
John
alone
on
Sunday
,
tell
him
my
opinion
,
and
beg
him
to
set
himself
right
,
else
the
consequences
may
be
very
bad
;
for
I
see
not
how
they
can
well
want
him
neither
,
and
he
would
make
a
troublesome
enemy
.
 
<EOS>
But
enough
of
politics
.
  
<EOS>
28
.
 
<EOS>
Morning
.
 
<EOS>
I
forgot
to
tell
you
that
Mr.
Harley
asked
me
yesterday
how
he
came
to
disoblige
the
Archbishop
of
Dublin
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
which
(
having
not
his
letter
about
me
)
I
told
him
what
the
Bishop
had
written
to
me
on
that
subject
,
and
desired
I
might
read
him
the
letter
some
other
time
.
 
<EOS>
But
after
all
,
from
what
I
have
heard
from
other
hands
,
I
am
afraid
the
Archbishop
is
a
little
guilty
.
 
<EOS>
Here
is
one
Brent
Spencer
,
a
brother
of
Mr.
Proby
's
,
who
affirms
it
,
and
says
he
has
leave
to
do
so
from
Charles
Dering
,
who
heard
the
words
;
and
that
Ingoldsby
,
abused
the
Archbishop
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
but
now
for
your
saucy
letter
:
 
I
have
no
room
to
answer
it
;
O
yes
,
enough
on
t'other
side
.
 
<EOS>
Are
you
no
sicker
?
 
<EOS>
Stella
jeers
Presto
for
not
coming
over
by
Christmas
;
but
indeed
Stella
does
not
jeer
,
but
reproach
,
poor
poor
Presto
.
<EOS>
And
how
can
I
come
away
and
the
First
-
Fruits
not
finished
?
 
<EOS>
I
am
of
opinion
<EOS>
the
Duke
of
Ormond
will
do
nothing
in
them
before
he
goes
,
which
will
be
in
a
fortnight
,
they
say
;
and
then
they
must
fall
to
me
to
be
done
in
his
absence
.
<EOS>
No
,
indeed
,
I
have
nothing
to
print
:
 
<EOS>
you
know
they
have
printed
the
Miscellanies
already
.
 
<EOS>
Are
they
on
your
side
yet
?
 
<EOS>
If
you
have
my
snuff
box
,
I
will
have
your
strong
box
.
 
<EOS>
Hi
,
does
Stella
take
snuff
again
?
<EOS>
or
is
it
only
because
it
is
a
fine
box
?
 
<EOS>
Not
the
Meddle
,
but
the
Medley
,
you
fool
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
yes
,
a
wretched
thing
,
because
it
is
against
you
Tories
:
 
<EOS>
now
I
think
it
very
fine
,
and
the
Examiner
a
wretched
thing
.
 
<EOS>
Twist
your
mouth
,
sirrah
.
<EOS>
Guiscard
,
and
what
you
will
read
in
the
Narrative
,
I
ordered
to
be
written
,
and
nothing
else
.
 
<EOS>
The
Spectator
is
written
by
Steele
,
with
Addison
's
help
:
 
<EOS>
it
is
often
very
pretty
.
 
<EOS>
Yesterday
it
was
made
of
a
noble
hint
I
gave
him
long
ago
for
his
Tatlers
,
about
an
Indian
supposed
to
write
his
Travels
into
England
.
 
<EOS>
I
repent
he
ever
had
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
intended
to
have
written
a
book
on
that
subject
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
he
has
spent
it
all
in
one
paper
,
and
all
the
under
-
hints
there
are
mine
too
;
but
I
never
see
him
or
Addison
.
 
<EOS>
The
Queen
is
well
,
but
I
fear
will
be
no
long
liver
;
for
I
am
told
she
has
sometimes
the
gout
in
her
bowels
(
I
hate
the
word
bowels
)
.
 
<EOS>
My
ears
have
been
,
these
three
months
past
,
much
better
than
any
time
these
two
years
;
but
now
they
begin
to
be
a
little
out
of
order
again
.
 
<EOS>
My
head
is
better
,
though
not
right
;
but
I
trust
to
air
and
walking
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
got
my
letter
,
but
<EOS>
what
number
?
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
18
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
my
shin
has
been
well
this
month
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
Mrs.
Westley
came
away
without
her
husband
's
knowledge
,
while
she
was
in
the
country
:
 
<EOS>
she
has
written
to
me
for
some
tea
.
 
<EOS>
They
lie
;
Mr.
Harley
's
wound
was
very
terrible
:
he
had
convulsions
,
and
very
narrowly
escaped
.
 
<EOS>
The
bruise
was
nine
times
worse
than
the
wound
:
 
he
is
weak
still
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
Brooks
married
;
I
know
all
that
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
sorry
for
Mrs.
Walls
's
eye
:
 
<EOS>
I
hope
'
tis
better
.
 
<EOS>
O
yes
,
you
are
great
walkers
:
 
<EOS>
but
I
have
heard
them
say
,
"
Much
talkers
,
little
walkers
"
:
<EOS>
and
I
believe
I
may
apply
the
old
proverb
to
you
        
<EOS>
If
you
talked
no
more
than
you
walked
,
     
<EOS>
Those
that
think
you
wits
would
be
baulked
.
  
<EOS>
Yes
,
Stella
shall
have
a
large
printed
Bible
:
 
<EOS>
I
have
put
it
down
among
my
commissions
for
MD
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
glad
to
hear
you
have
taken
the
fancy
of
intending
to
read
the
Bible
.
 
<EOS>
Pox
take
the
box
;
is
not
it
come
yet
?
 
<EOS>
This
is
trusting
to
your
young
fellows
,
young
women
;
'
tis
your
fault
:
 
<EOS>
I
thought
you
had
such
power
with
Sterne
that
he
would
fly
over
Mount
Atlas
to
serve
you
.
 
<EOS>
You
say
you
are
not
splenetic
;
but
if
you
be
,
faith
,
you
will
break
poor
Presto
's
 
<EOS>
I
will
not
say
the
rest
;
but
I
vow
to
God
,
if
I
could
decently
come
over
now
,
I
would
,
and
leave
all
schemes
of
politics
and
ambition
for
ever
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
the
opportunities
here
of
preserving
my
health
by
riding
,
etc
.
,
that
I
have
in
Ireland
;
and
the
want
of
health
is
a
great
cooler
of
making
one
's
court
.
 
<EOS>
You
guess
right
about
my
being
bit
with
a
direction
from
Walls
,
and
the
letter
from
MD
:
 
<EOS>
I
believe
I
described
it
in
one
of
my
last
.
 
<EOS>
This
goes
to
-
night
;
and
I
must
now
rise
and
walk
to
town
,
and
walk
back
in
the
evening
.
 
<EOS>
God
Almighty
bless
and
preserve
poor
MD
.
 
<EOS>
Farewell
.
  
<EOS>
O
,
faith
<EOS>
,
do
n't
think
,
<EOS>
saucy
noses
,
that
I
'll
fill
this
third
side
:
 
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
stay
a
letter
above
a
fortnight
:
 
<EOS>
it
must
go
then
;
and
you
would
rather
see
a
short
one
like
this
,
than
want
it
a
week
longer
.

My
humble
service

LETTER

<EOS>
CHELSEA
,
April
28
,
1711
.
  
<EOS>
At
night
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
at
night
,
because
I
finished
my
twenty
-
first
this
morning
here
,
and
put
it
into
the
post
-
office
my
own
self
,
like
a
good
boy
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
am
a
little
before
you
now
,
young
women
:
 
<EOS>
I
am
writing
my
twenty
-
second
,
and
have
received
your
thirteenth
.
 
<EOS>
I
got
to
town
between
twelve
and
one
,
and
put
on
my
new
gown
and
periwig
,
and
dined
with
Lord
Abercorn
,
where
I
had
not
been
since
the
marriage
of
his
son
Lord
Peasley
,
who
has
got
ten
thousand
pounds
with
a
wife
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
now
a
country
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
I
walked
home
as
I
went
,
and
am
a
little
weary
,
and
am
got
into
bed
:
 
<EOS>
I
hope
in
God
the
air
and
exercise
will
do
me
a
little
good
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
inquiring
about
statues
for
Mrs.
Ashe
:
 
<EOS>
I
made
Lady
Abercorn
go
with
me
;
and
will
send
them
word
next
post
to
Clogher
.
 
<EOS>
I
hate
to
buy
for
her
:
 
<EOS>
I
am
sure
she
will
maunder
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
going
to
study
.
  
<EOS>
29
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
a
charming
walk
to
and
from
town
to
-
day
:
 
<EOS>
I
washed
,
shaved
and
all
,
and
changed
gown
and
periwig
,
by
half
an
hour
after
nine
,
and
went
to
the
Secretary
,
who
told
me
how
he
had
differed
with
his
friends
in
Parliament
:
 
<EOS>
I
apprehended
this
division
,
and
told
him
a
great
deal
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
went
to
Court
,
and
there
several
mentioned
it
to
me
as
what
they
much
disliked
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
with
the
Secretary
;
and
we
proposed
doing
some
business
of
importance
in
the
afternoon
,
which
he
broke
to
me
first
,
and
said
how
he
and
Mr.
Harley
were
convinced
of
the
necessity
of
it
;
yet
he
suffered
one
of
his
under
-
secretaries
to
come
upon
us
after
dinner
,
who
stayed
till
six
,
and
so
nothing
was
done
:
and
what
care
I
?
<EOS>
he
shall
send
to
me
the
next
time
,
and
ask
twice
.
 
<EOS>
To
-
morrow
<EOS>
I
go
to
the
election
at
Westminster
School
,
where
lads
are
chosen
for
the
University
:
 
<EOS>
they
say
it
is
a
sight
,
and
<EOS>
a
great
trial
of
wits
.
 
<EOS>
Our
Expedition
Fleet
is
but
just
sailed
:
 
<EOS>
I
believe
it
will
come
to
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Secretary
frets
at
their
tediousness
,
but
hopes
great
things
from
it
,
though
he
owns
four
or
five
princes
are
in
the
secret
;
and
,
for
that
reason
,
I
fear
it
is
no
secret
to
France
.
 
<EOS>
There
are
eight
regiments
;
and
the
Admiral
is
your
Walker
's
brother
the
midwife
.
  
<EOS>

.
 
<EOS>
Morn
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
here
in
a
pretty
pickle
:
 
<EOS>
it
rains
hard
;
and
the
cunning
natives
of
Chelsea
have
outwitted
me
,
and
taken
up
all
the
three
stage
coaches
.
 
<EOS>
What
shall
I
do
?
 
<EOS>
I
must
go
to
town
:
 
<EOS>
this
is
your
fault
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
walk
:
 
<EOS>
I
will
borrow
a
coat
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
the
blind
side
of
my
lodging
out
of
town
;
I
must
expect
such
inconveniences
as
these
.
 
<EOS>
Faith
,
I
'll
walk
in
the
rain
.
 
<EOS>
Morrow
.
 
<EOS>
At
night
.
 
<EOS>
I
got
a
gentleman
's
chaise
by
chance
,
and
so
went
to
town
for
a
shilling
,
and
lie
this
night
in
town
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
at
the
election
of
lads
at
Westminster
to
-
day
,
and
a
very
silly
thing
it
is
;
but
they
say
there
will
be
fine
doings
to
-
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
with
Dr.
Freind
,
the
second
master
of
the
school
,
with
a
dozen
parsons
and
others
:
 
<EOS>
Prior
would
make
me
stay
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Harley
is
to
hear
the
election
to
-
morrow
;
and
we
are
all
to
dine
with
tickets
,
and
hear
fine
speeches
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
terrible
rainy
weather
again
:
 
<EOS>
I
lie
at
a
friend
's
in
the
City
.
  
<EOS>
May
1
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
you
a
merry
May
Day
,
and
a
thousand
more
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
baulked
at
Westminster
;
I
came
too
late
:
 
<EOS>
I
heard
no
speeches
nor
verses
.
 
<EOS>
They
would
not
let
me
in
to
their
dining
-
place
for
want
of
a
ticket
;
and
I
would
not
send
in
for
one
,
because
Mr.
Harley
excused
his
coming
,
and
Atterbury
was
not
there
;
and
I
cared
not
for
the
rest
:
 
and
so
my
friend
Lewis
<EOS>
and
I
dined
with
Kitt
Musgrave
,
<EOS>
if
you
know
such
a
man
:
 
and
,
the
weather
mending
,
I
walked
gravely
home
this
evening
;
and
so
I
design
to
walk
and
walk
till
I
am
well
:
 
<EOS>
I
fancy
myself
a
little
better
already
.
 
<EOS>
How
does
poor
Stella
?
 
<EOS>
Dingley
is
well
enough
.
 
<EOS>
Go
,
get
you
gone
,
naughty
girl
,
you
are
well
enough
.
 
<EOS>
O
dear
MD
,
contrive
to
have
some
share
of
the
country
this
spring
:
 
go
to
Finglas
,
or
Donnybrook
,
or
Clogher
,
or
Killala
,
or
Lowth
.
 
<EOS>
Have
you
got
your
box
yet
?
<EOS>
Yes
,
yes
.
 
<EOS>
Do
not
write
to
me
again
till
this
letter
goes
:
 
<EOS>
I
must
make
haste
,
that
I
may
write
two
for
one
.
 
<EOS>
Go
to
the
Bath
:
 
<EOS>
I
hope
you
are
now
at
the
Bath
,
if
you
had
a
mind
to
go
;
or
go
to
Wexford
:
 
do
something
for
your
living
.
 
<EOS>
Have
you
given
up
my
lodging
,
according
to
order
?
 
<EOS>
I
have
had
just
now
a
compliment
from
Dean
Atterbury
's
lady
,
to
command
the
garden
and
library
,
and
whatever
the
house
affords
.
 
<EOS>
I
lodge
just
over
against
them
;
but
the
Dean
is
in
town
with
his
Convocation
:
 
<EOS>
so
I
have
my
Dean
and
Prolocutor
as
well
as
you
,
young
women
,
though
he
has
not
so
good
wine
,
nor
so
much
meat
.
  
<EOS>

.
 
<EOS>
A
fine
day
,
but
begins
to
grow
a
little
warm
;
and
that
makes
your
little
fat
Presto
sweat
in
the
forehead
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
,
are
not
the
fine
buns
sold
here
in
our
town
;
was
it
not
Rrrrrrrrrare
Chelsea
buns
?
 
<EOS>
I
bought
one
to
-
day
in
my
walk
;
it
cost
me
a
penny
;
it
was
stale
,
and
I
did
not
like
it
,
as
the
man
said
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
Andrew
Fountaine
and
I
dined
at
Mrs.
Vanhomrigh
's
,
and
had
a
flask
of
my
Florence
,
which
lies
in
their
cellar
;
and
so
I
came
home
gravely
,
and
saw
nobody
of
consequence
to
-
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
very
easy
here
,
nobody
plaguing
me
in
a
morning
;
and
Patrick
saves
many
a
score
lies
.
 
<EOS>
I
sent
over
to
Mrs
Atterbury
to
know
whether
I
might
wait
on
her
;
but
she
is
gone
a
visiting
:
 
we
have
exchanged
some
compliments
,
but
I
have
not
seen
her
yet
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
no
news
in
our
town
.
  
<EOS>

.
 
<EOS>
I
did
not
go
to
town
to
-
day
,
it
was
so
terrible
rainy
;
nor
have
I
stirred
out
of
my
room
till
eight
<EOS>
this
evening
,
when
I
crossed
the
way
to
see
Mrs.
Atterbury
,
and
thank
her
for
her
civilities
.
 
<EOS>
She
would
needs
send
me
some
veal
,
and
small
beer
,
and
ale
,
to
-
day
at
dinner
;
and
I
have
lived
a
scurvy
,
dull
,
splenetic
day
,
for
want
of
MD
:
 
<EOS>
I
often
thought
how
happy
I
could
have
been
,
had
it
rained
eight
thousand
times
more
,
if
MD
had
been
with
a
body
.
 
<EOS>
My
Lord
Rochester
is
dead
this
morning
;
they
say
at
one
o'clock
;
and
I
hear
he
died
suddenly
.
 
<EOS>
To
-
morrow
<EOS>
I
shall
know
more
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
a
great
loss
to
us
:
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
think
who
will
succeed
him
as
Lord
President
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
writing
a
long
letter
to
Lord
Peterborow
,
and
am
dull
.
  
<EOS>

.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
to
-
day
at
Lord
Shelburne
's
,
where
Lady
Kerry
made
me
a
present
of
four
India
handkerchiefs
,
which
I
have
a
mind
to
keep
for
little
MD
,
only
that
I
had
rather
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
a
mighty
handkerchief
-
monger
,
and
have
bought
abundance
of
snuff
ones
since
I
have
left
off
taking
snuff
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
am
resolved
,
when
I
come
over
,
MD
shall
be
acquainted
with
Lady
Kerry
:
 
we
have
struck
up
a
mighty
friendship
;
and
she
has
much
better
sense
than
any
other
lady
of
your
country
.
 
<EOS>
We
are
almost
in
love
with
one
another
:
 
<EOS>
but
she
is
most
egregiously
ugly
;
but
perfectly
well
-
bred
,
and
governable
as
I
please
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
resolved
,
when
I
come
,
to
keep
no
company
but
MD
:
 
<EOS>
you
know
I
kept
my
resolution
last
time
;
and
,
except
Mr.
Addison
,
conversed
with
none
but
you
and
your
club
of
deans
and
Stoytes
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
three
weeks
,
young
women
,
since
I
had
a
letter
from
you
;
and
yet
,
methinks
,
I
would
not
have
another
for
five
pounds
till
this
is
gone
;
and
yet
I
send
every
day
to
the
Coffee
-
house
,
and
I
would
fain
have
a
letter
,
and
not
have
a
letter
:
 
<EOS>
and
I
do
not
know
what
,
nor
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
how
,
and
this
goes
on
very
slow
;
it
is
a
week
to
-
morrow
since
I
began
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
a
poor
country
gentleman
,
and
do
not
know
how
the
world
passes
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
know
that
every
syllable
I
write
I
hold
my
lips
just
for
all
the
world
as
if
I
were
talking
in
our
own
little
language
to
MD
?
 
<EOS>
Faith
,
I
am
very
silly
;
but
I
can
not
help
it
for
my
life
.
 
<EOS>
I
got
home
early
to
-
night
.
 
<EOS>
My
solicitors
,
that
used
to
ply
me
every
morning
,
knew
not
where
to
find
me
;
and
I
am
so
happy
not
to
hear
"
Patrick
,
Patrick
,
"
called
a
hundred
times
every
morning
.
<EOS>
But
I
looked
backward
,
and
find
I
have
said
this
before
.
 
<EOS>
What
care
I
?
 
<EOS>
Go
to
the
Dean
,
and
roast
the
oranges
.
  
<EOS>

.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
to
-
day
with
my
friend
Lewis
,
and
we
were
deep
in
politics
how
to
save
the
present
Ministry
;
for
I
am
afraid
of
Mr.
Secretary
,
as
I
believe
I
told
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
went
in
the
evening
to
see
Mr.
Harley
;
and
,
upon
my
word
,
I
was
in
perfect
joy
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Secretary
was
just
going
out
of
the
door
;
but
I
made
him
come
back
,
and
there
was
the
old
Saturday
Club
,
Lord
Keeper
,
Lord
Rivers
,
Mr.
Secretary
,
Mr.
Harley
,
and
I
;
the
first
time
since
his
stabbing
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Secretary
went
away
;
but
I
stayed
till
nine
,
and
made
Mr.
Harley
show
me
his
breast
,
and
tell
all
the
story
;
and
I
showed
him
the
Archbishop
of
Dublin
's
letter
,
and
defended
him
effectually
.
 
<EOS>
We
were
all
in
mighty
good
humour
.
<EOS>
Lord
Keeper
and
I
left
them
together
,
and
I
walked
here
after
nine
two
miles
,
and
I
found
a
parson
drunk
fighting
with
a
seaman
,
and
Patrick
and
I
were
so
wise
to
part
them
,
but
the
seaman
followed
him
to
Chelsea
,
cursing
at
him
,
and
the
parson
slipped
into
a
house
,
and
I
know
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
It
mortified
me
to
see
a
man
in
my
coat
so
overtaken
.
 
<EOS>
A
pretty
scene
for
one
that
just
came
from
sitting
with
the
Prime
Ministers
!
 
<EOS>
I
had
no
money
in
my
pocket
,
and
so
could
not
be
robbed
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
nothing
but
Mr.
Harley
shall
make
me
take
such
a
journey
again
.
 
<EOS>
We
do
n't
yet
know
who
will
be
President
in
Lord
Rochester
's
room
.
 
<EOS>
I
measured
,
and
found
that
the
penknife
would
have
killed
Mr.
Harley
if
it
had
gone
but
<EOS>
half
the
breadth
of
my
thumb
-
nail
<EOS>
lower
,
<EOS>
so
near
was
he
to
death
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
so
curious
as
to
ask
him
what
were
his
thoughts
while
they
were
carrying
him
home
in
the
chair
.
 
<EOS>
He
said
he
concluded
himself
a
dead
man
.
 
<EOS>
He
will
not
allow
that
Guiscard
gave
him
the
second
stab
;
though
my
Lord
Keeper
,
who
is
blind
,
and
I
that
was
not
there
,
are
positive
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
wears
a
plaster
still
as
broad
as
half
a
crown
.
 
<EOS>
Smoke
how
wide
the
lines
are
,
but
,
faith
,
I
do
n't
do
it
on
purpose
:
 
<EOS>
but
I
have
changed
my
side
in
this
new
Chelsea
bed
,
and
I
do
not
know
how
,
methinks
,
but
it
is
so
unfit
,
and
so
awkward
,
never
saw
the
like
.
  
<EOS>

.
 
<EOS>
You
must
remember
to
enclose
your
letters
in
a
fair
paper
,
and
direct
the
outside
thus
:
 
"
To
Erasmus
Lewis
,
Esq
.
;
at
my
Lord
Dartmouth
's
office
at
Whitehall
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
said
so
before
,
but
it
may
miscarry
,
you
know
,
yet
I
think
none
of
my
letters
did
ever
miscarry
;
faith
<EOS>
,
I
think
never
one
;
among
all
the
privateers
and
the
storms
.
 
<EOS>
O
,
faith
,
my
letters
are
too
good
to
be
lost
.
<EOS>
MD
's
letters
may
tarry
,
but
never
miscarry
,
as
the
old
woman
used
to
say
.
 
<EOS>
And
indeed
,
how
should
they
miscarry
,
when
they
never
come
before
their
time
?
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
terrible
rainy
day
;
yet
I
made
a
shift
to
steal
fair
weather
overhead
enough
to
go
and
come
in
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
early
with
the
Secretary
,
and
dined
with
him
afterwards
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
morning
I
began
to
chide
him
,
and
tell
him
my
fears
of
his
proceedings
.
 
<EOS>
But
Arthur
Moore
came
up
and
relieved
him
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
forgot
,
for
you
never
heard
of
Arthur
Moore
.
 
<EOS>
But
when
I
get
Mr.
Harley
alone
,
I
will
know
the
bottom
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
have
Dr.
Raymond
over
before
this
letter
,
and
what
care
you
?
  
<EOS>
7
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
and
believe
my
walks
every
day
do
me
good
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
busy
at
home
,
and
set
out
late
this
morning
,
and
dined
with
Mrs.
Vanhomrigh
,
at
whose
lodgings
I
always
change
my
gown
and
periwig
.
 
<EOS>
I
visited
this
afternoon
,
and
among
others
,
poor
Biddy
Floyd
,
who
is
very
red
,
but
I
believe
wo
n't
be
much
marked
.
 
<EOS>
As
I
was
coming
home
,
I
met
Sir
George
Beaumont
in
the
Pall
Mall
,
who
would
needs
walk
with
me
as
far
as
Buckingham
House
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
telling
him
of
my
head
;
he
said
he
had
been
ill
of
the
same
disorder
,
and
by
all
means
forbid
me
bohea
tea
,
which
,
he
said
,
always
gave
it
him
;
and
that
Dr.
Radcliffe
said
it
was
very
bad
.
 
<EOS>
Now
I
had
observed
the
same
thing
,
and
have
left
it
off
this
month
,
having
found
myself
ill
after
it
several
times
;
and
I
mention
it
that
Stella
may
consider
it
for
her
own
poor
little
head
:
 
<EOS>
a
pound
lies
ready
packed
up
and
directed
for
Mrs.
Walls
,
to
be
sent
by
the
first
convenience
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Secretary
told
me
yesterday
that
Mr.
Harley
would
this
week
be
Lord
Treasurer
and
a
peer
;
so
I
expect
it
every
day
;
yet
perhaps
it
may
not
be
till
Parliament
is
up
,
which
will
be
in
a
fortnight
.
  
<EOS>

<EOS>
I
was
to
-
day
with
the
Duke
of
Ormond
,
and
recommended
to
him
the
care
of
poor
Joe
Beaumont
,
who
promises
me
to
do
him
all
justice
and
favour
,
and
give
him
encouragement
;
and
desired
I
would
give
a
memorial
to
Ned
Southwell
about
it
,
which
I
will
,
and
so
tell
Joe
when
you
see
him
,
though
he
knows
it
already
by
a
letter
I
writ
to
Mr.
Warburton
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
bloody
hot
walking
to
-
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
in
the
City
,
and
went
and
came
by
water
;
and
it
rained
so
this
evening
again
,
that
I
thought
I
should
hardly
be
able
to
get
a
dry
hour
to
walk
home
in
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
send
to
-
morrow
to
the
Coffee
-
house
for
a
letter
from
MD
;
but
I
would
not
have
one
methinks
till
this
is
gone
,
as
it
shall
on
Saturday
.
 
<EOS>
I
visited
the
Duchess
of
Ormond
this
morning
;
she
does
not
go
over
with
the
Duke
.
 
<EOS>
I
spoke
to
her
to
get
a
lad
touched
for
the
evil
,
the
son
of
a
grocer
in
Capel
Street
,
one
Bell
;
the
ladies
have
bought
sugar
and
plums
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Mary
used
to
go
there
often
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
Patrick
's
account
;
and
the
poor
fellow
has
been
here
some
months
with
his
boy
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
Queen
has
not
been
able
to
touch
,
and
it
now
grows
so
warm
<EOS>
,
I
fear
she
will
not
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
Go
,
go
,
go
to
the
Dean
's
,
and
let
him
carry
you
to
Donnybrook
,
and
cut
asparagus
.
<EOS>
Has
Parvisol
sent
you
any
this
year
?
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
sleep
in
the
beginnings
of
the
nights
,
the
heat
or
something
hinders
me
,
and
I
am
drowsy
in
the
mornings
.

<EOS>
Dr.
Freind
came
this
morning
to
visit
Atterbury
's
lady
and
children
as
physician
,
and
persuaded
me
to
go
with
him
to
town
in
his
chariot
.
 
<EOS>
He
told
me
he
had
been
an
hour
before
with
Sir
Cholmley
Dering
,
Charles
Dering
's
nephew
,
and
head
of
that
family
in
Kent
,
for
which
he
is
Knight
of
the
shire
.
 
<EOS>
He
said
he
left
him
dying
of
a
pistol
-
shot
quite
through
the
body
,
by
one
Mr.
Thornhill
.
 
<EOS>
They
fought
at
sword
and
pistol
this
morning
in
Tuttle
Fields
,
their
pistols
so
near
that
the
muzzles
touched
.
 
<EOS>
Thornhill
discharged
first
;
and
Dering
,
having
received
the
shot
,
discharged
his
pistol
as
he
was
falling
,
so
it
went
into
the
air
.
 
<EOS>
The
story
of
this
quarrel
is
long
.
 
<EOS>
Thornhill
had
lost
seven
teeth
by
a
kick
in
the
mouth
from
Dering
,
who
had
first
knocked
him
down
;
this
was
above
a
fortnight
ago
.
 
<EOS>
Dering
was
next
week
to
be
married
to
a
fine
young
lady
.
 
<EOS>
This
makes
a
noise
here
,
but
you
will
not
value
it
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
Mr.
Harley
,
Lord
Keeper
,
and
one
or
two
more
,
are
to
be
made
lords
immediately
;
their
patents
are
now
passing
,
and
I
read
the
preamble
to
Mr.
Harley
's
,
full
of
his
praises
.
 
<EOS>
Lewis
and
I
dined
with
Ford
:
I
found
the
wine
;
two
flasks
of
my
Florence
,
and
two
bottles
of
six
that
Dr.
Raymond
sent
me
of
French
wine
;
he
sent
it
to
me
to
drink
with
Sir
Robert
Raymond
and
Mr.
Harley
's
brother
,
whom
I
had
introduced
him
to
;
but
they
never
could
find
time
to
come
;
and
now
I
have
left
the
town
,
and
it
is
too
late
.
 
<EOS>
Raymond
will
think
it
a
cheat
.
 
<EOS>
What
care
I
,
sirrah
?

<EOS>
Pshaw

<EOS>
Patrick
brought
me
four
letters
to
-
day
:
 
from
Dilly
at
Bath
;
Joe
;
Parvisol
;
and
what
was
the
fourth
,
who
can
tell
?
 
<EOS>
Stand
away
,
who
'll
guess
?
 
<EOS>
Who
can
it
be
?
 
<EOS>
You
old
man
with
a
stick
<EOS>
,
can
you
tell
who
the
fourth
is
from
?
 
<EOS>
Iss
,
an
please
your
honour
<EOS>
,
it
is
from
one
Madam
MD
,
Number
Fourteen
.
 
<EOS>
Well
;
but
I
ca
n't
send
this
away
now
,
because
it
was
here
,
and
I
was
in
town
;
but
it
shall
go
on
Saturday
,
and
this
is
Thursday
night
,
and
it
will
be
time
enough
for
Wexford
.
 
<EOS>
Take
my
method
:
 
<EOS>
I
write
here
to
Parvisol
to
lend
Stella
twenty
pounds
,
and
to
take
her
note
promissory
to
pay
it
in
half
a
year
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
You
shall
see
,
and
if
you
want
more
,
let
me
know
afterwards
;
and
be
sure
my
money
shall
be
always
paid
constantly
too
.
 
<EOS>
Have
you
been
good
or
ill
housewives
,
pray
?
  
<EOS>
11
.
 
<EOS>
Joe
has
written
me
to
get
him
a
collector
's
place
,
nothing
less
;
he
says
all
the
world
knows
of
my
great
intimacy
with
Mr.
Harley
,
and
that
the
smallest
word
to
him
will
do
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
<EOS>
the
constant
ca
nt
of
puppies
who
are
at
a
distance
,
and
strangers
to
Courts
and
Ministers
.
 
<EOS>
My
answer
is
this
,
which
pray
send
:
 
that
I
am
ready
to
serve
Joe
as
far
as
I
can
;
that
I
have
spoken
to
the
Duke
of
Ormond
about
his
money
,
as
I
writ
to
Warburton
;
that
for
the
particular
he
mentions
,
it
is
a
work
of
time
,
which
I
can
not
think
of
at
present
;
but
,
if
accidents
and
opportunities
should
happen
hereafter
,
I
would
not
be
wanting
;
<EOS>
that
I
know
best
how
far
my
credit
goes
;
that
he
is
at
a
distance
,
and
can
not
judge
;
that
I
would
be
glad
to
do
him
good
,
and
if
fortune
throws
an
opportunity
in
my
way
I
shall
not
be
wanting
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
my
answer
,
which
you
may
send
or
read
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
contrive
that
Parvisol
may
not
run
away
with
my
two
hundred
pounds
;
but
get
Burton
's
note
,
and
let
the
money
be
returned
me
by
bill
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
laugh
,
for
I
will
be
suspicious
.
<EOS>
Teach
Parvisol
to
enclose
,
and
direct
the
outside
to
Mr.
Lewis
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
answer
your
letter
in
my
next
,
only
what
I
take
notice
of
here
excepted
.
 
<EOS>
I
forgot
to
tell
you
that
at
the
Court
of
Requests
to
-
day
<EOS>
I
could
not
find
a
dinner
I
liked
,
and
it
grew
late
,
and
I
dined
with
Mrs.
Vanhomrigh
,
etc
.
  
<EOS>
12
.
 
<EOS>
Morning
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
finish
this
letter
before
I
go
to
town
,
because
I
shall
be
busy
,
and
have
neither
time
nor
place
there

LETTER
23
.
 
<EOS>
CHELSEA
,
May
12
,
1711
.
  
<EOS>
I
sent
you
my
twenty
-
second
this
afternoon
in
town
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
with
Mr.
Harley
and
the
old
Club
,
Lord
Rivers
,
Lord
Keeper
,
and
Mr.
Secretary
.
 
<EOS>
They
rallied
me
last
week
,
and
said
I
must
have
Mr.
St.
John
's
leave
;
so
I
writ
to
him
yesterday
,
that
foreseeing
I
should
never
dine
again
with
Sir
Simon
Harcourt
,
Knight
,
and
Robert
Harley
,
Esq
.
<EOS>
,
I
was
resolved
to
do
it
to
-
day
.
 
<EOS>
The
jest
is
,
that
before
Saturday
next
we
expect
they
will
be
lords
;
for
Mr.
Harley
's
patent
is
drawing
,
to
be
Earl
of
Oxford
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Secretary
and
I
came
away
at
seven
,
and
he
brought
me
to
our
town
's
end
in
his
coach
;
<EOS>
so
I
lost
my
walk
.
<EOS>
St.
John
read
my
letter
to
the
company
,
which
was
all
raillery
,
and
passed
purely
.
  
<EOS>
13
.
 
<EOS>
It
rained
all
last
night
and
this
morning
as
heavy
as
lead
;
but
I
just
got
fair
weather
to
walk
to
town
before
church
.
 
<EOS>
The
roads
are
all
over
in
deep
puddle
.
 
<EOS>
The
hay
of
our
town
is
almost
fit
to
be
mowed
.
 
<EOS>
I
went
to
Court
after
church
(
as
I
always
do
on
Sundays
,
and
then
dined
with
Mr.
Secretary
,
who
has
engaged
me
for
every
Sunday
;
and
poor
MD
dined
at
home
upon
a
bit
of
veal
and
a
pint
of
wine
.
 
<EOS>
Is
it
not
plaguy
insipid
to
tell
you
every
day
where
I
dine
?
<EOS>
yet
now
I
have
got
into
the
way
of
it
<EOS>
,
I
can
not
forbear
it
neither
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
Mr.
Presto
,
you
had
better
go
answer
MD
's
letter
,
N.14
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
answer
it
when
I
please
,
Mr.
Doctor
.
 
<EOS>
What
is
that
you
say
?
 
<EOS>
The
Court
was
very
full
this
morning
,
expecting
Mr.
Harley
would
be
declared
Earl
of
Oxford
and
have
the
Treasurer
's
staff
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Harley
never
comes
to
Court
at
all
;
somebody
there
asked
me
the
reason
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
"
said
I
,
"
the
Lord
of
Oxford
knows
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
He
always
goes
to
the
Queen
by
the
back
stairs
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
told
for
certain
,
you
jackanapes
,
Lord
Santry
was
dead
,
Captain
Cammock
assured
me
so
;
and
now
he
's
alive
again
,
they
say
;
but
that
sha
n't
do
:
 
<EOS>
he
shall
be
dead
to
me
as
long
as
he
lives
.
 
<EOS>
Dick
Tighe
and
I
meet
,
and
never
stir
our
hats
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
resolved
to
mistake
him
for
Witherington
,
the
little
nasty
lawyer
that
came
up
to
me
so
sternly
at
the
Castle
the
day
I
left
Ireland
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
ask
the
gentleman
I
saw
walking
with
him
how
long
Witherington
has
been
in
town
.
  
<EOS>
14
.
 
<EOS>
I
went
to
town
to
-
day
by
water
.
 
<EOS>
The
hail
quite
discouraged
me
from
walking
,
and
there
is
no
shade
in
the
greatest
part
of
the
way
.
 
<EOS>
I
took
the
first
boat
,
and
had
a
footman
my
companion
;
then
I
went
again
by
water
,
and
dined
in
the
City
with
a
printer
,
to
whom
I
carried
a
pamphlet
in
manuscript
,
that
Mr.
Secretary
gave
me
.
 
<EOS>
The
printer
sent
it
to
the
Secretary
for
his
approbation
,
and
he
desired
me
to
look
it
over
,
which
I
did
,
and
found
it
a
very
scurvy
piece
.
 
<EOS>
The
reason
I
tell
you
so
,
is
because
it
was
done
by
your
parson
Slap
,
Scrap
,
Flap
(
what
d'ye
call
him
)
,
Trapp
,
your
Chancellor
's
chaplain
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
called
A
Character
of
the
Present
Set
of
Whigs
,
and
is
going
to
be
printed
,
and
no
doubt
the
author
will
take
care
to
produce
it
in
Ireland
.
 
<EOS>
Dr.
Freind
was
with
me
,
and
pulled
out
a
twopenny
pamphlet
just
published
,
called
The
State
of
Wit
,
giving
a
character
of
all
the
papers
that
have
come
out
of
late
.
 
<EOS>
The
author
seems
to
be
a
Whig
,
yet
he
speaks
very
highly
of
a
paper
called
the
Examiner
,
and
says
the
supposed
author
of
it
is
Dr.
Swift
.
 
<EOS>
But
above
all
things
he
praises
the
Tatlers
and
Spectators
;
and
I
believe
Steele
and
Addison
were
privy
to
the
printing
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
is
one
treated
by
these
impudent
dogs
.
 
<EOS>
And
that
villain
Curll
has
scraped
up
some
trash
,
and
calls
it
Dr.
Swift
's
Miscellanies
,
with
the
name
at
large
:
 
<EOS>
and
I
can
get
no
satisfaction
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
Nay
,
Mr.
Harley
told
me
he
had
read
it
,
and
only
laughed
at
me
before
Lord
Keeper
and
the
rest
.
 
<EOS>
Since
I
came
home
,
I
have
been
sitting
with
the
Prolocutor
,
Dean
Atterbury
,
who
is
my
neighbour
over
the
way
,
but
generally
keeps
in
town
with
his
Convocation
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
late

etc

<EOS>
My
walk
to
town
to
-
day
was
after
ten
,
and
prodigiously
hot
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
with
Lord
Shelburne
,
and
have
desired
Mrs.
Pratt
,
who
lodges
there
,
to
carry
over
Mrs.
Walls
's
tea
;
I
hope
she
will
do
it
,
and
they
talk
of
going
in
a
fortnight
.
 
<EOS>
My
way
is
this
:
 
I
leave
my
best
gown
and
periwig
at
Mrs.
Vanhomrigh
's
,
then
walk
up
the
Pall
Mall
,
through
the
Park
,
out
at
Buckingham
House
,
and
so
to
Chelsea
a
little
beyond
the
church
:
 
<EOS>
I
set
out
about
sunset
,
and
get
here
in
something
less
than
an
hour
;
it
is
two
good
miles
,
and
just
five
thousand
seven
hundred
and
forty
-
eight
steps
;
so
there
is
four
miles
a
day
walking
,
without
reckoning
what
I
walk
while
I
stay
in
town
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
pass
the
Mall
in
the
evening
,
it
is
prodigious
to
see
the
number
of
ladies
walking
there
;
and
I
always
cry
shame
at
the
ladies
of
Ireland
,
who
never
walk
at
all
,
as
if
their
legs
were
of
no
use
,
but
to
be
laid
aside
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
now
almost
three
weeks
here
,
and
I
thank
God
,
am
much
better
in
my
head
,
if
it
does
but
continue
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
you
what
,
if
I
was
with
you
,
when
we
went
to
Stoyte
at
Donnybrook
,
we
would
only
take
a
coach
to
the
hither
end
of
Stephen
's
Green
,
and
from
thence
go
every
step
on
foot
,
yes
,
faith
,
every
step
;
it
would
do
DD
good
as
well
as
Presto
.
 
<EOS>
Everybody
tells
me
I
look
better
already
;
for
,
faith
,
I
looked
sadly
,
that
is
certain
.
 
<EOS>
My
breakfast
is
milk
porridge
:
<EOS>
I
do
not
love
it
;
faith
,
I
hate
it
,
but
it
is
cheap
and
wholesome
;
and
I
hate
to
be
obliged
to
either
of
those
qualities

<EOS>
I
wonder
why
Presto
will
be
so
tedious
in
answering
MD
's
letters
;
because
he
would
keep
the
best
to
the
last
,
I
suppose
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
Presto
must
be
humoured
,
it
must
be
as
he
will
have
it
,
or
there
will
be
an
old
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
Dead
with
heat
;
are
not
you
very
hot
?
 
<EOS>
My
walks
make
my
forehead
sweat
rarely
;
sometimes
my
morning
journey
is
by
water
,
as
it
was
to
-
day
with
one
Parson
Richardson
,
who
came
to
see
me
,
on
his
going
to
Ireland
;
and
with
him
I
send
Mrs.
Walls
's
tea
,
and
three
books
I
got
from
the
Lords
of
the
Treasury
for
the
College
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
with
Lord
Shelburne
to
-
day
;
Lady
Kerry
and
Mrs.
Pratt
are
going
likewise
for
Ireland
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
!
<EOS>
I
forgot
,
I
dined
with
Mr.
Prior
to
-
day
,
at
his
house
,
with
Dean
Atterbury
and
others
;
and
came
home
pretty
late
,
and
I
think
I
'm
in
a
fuzz
,
and
do
n't
know
what
I
say
,
never
saw
the
like
.
  
<EOS>

.
 
<EOS>
Sterne
came
here
by
water
to
see
me
this
morning
,
and
I
went
back
with
him
to
his
boat
.
 
<EOS>
He
tells
me
that
Mrs.
Edgworth
married
a
fellow
in
her
journey
to
Chester
;
so
I
believe
she
little
thought
of
anybody
's
box
but
her
own
.
 
<EOS>
I
desired
Sterne
to
give
me
directions
where
to
get
the
box
in
Chester
,
which
he
says
he
will
to
-
morrow
;
and
I
will
write
to
Richardson
to
get
it
up
there
as
he
goes
by
,
and
whip
it
over
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
directed
to
Mrs.
Curry
:
 
you
must
caution
her
of
it
,
and
desire
her
to
send
it
you
when
it
comes
.
 
<EOS>
Sterne
says
Jemmy
Leigh
loves
London
mightily
;
that
makes
him
stay
so
long
,
I
believe
,
and
not
Sterne
's
business
,
which
Mr.
Harley
's
accident
has
put
much
backward
.
 
<EOS>
We
expect
now
every
day
that
he
will
be
Earl
of
Oxford
and
Lord
Treasurer
.
 
<EOS>
His
patent
is
passing
;
but
,
they
say
,
Lord
Keeper
's
not
yet
;
at
least
his
son
,
young
Harcourt
,
told
me
so
t'other
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
to
-
day
privately
with
my
friend
Lewis
at
his
lodgings
at
Whitehall
.
 
<EOS>
T'other
day
at
Whitehall
I
met
a
lady
of
my
acquaintance
,
whom
I
had
not
seen
before
since
I
came
to
England
;
we
were
mighty
glad
to
see
each
other
,
and
she
has
engaged
me
to
visit
her
,
as
I
design
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
one
Mrs.
Colledge
:
 
she
has
lodgings
at
Whitehall
,
having
been
seamstress
to
King
William
,
<EOS>
worth
three
hundred
a
year
.
 
<EOS>
Her
father
was
a
fanatic
joiner
,
hanged
for
treason
in
Shaftesbury
's
plot
.
 
<EOS>
This
noble
person
and
<EOS>
I
were
brought
acquainted
,
some
years
ago
,
by
Lady
Berkeley
.
 
<EOS>
I
love
good
creditable
acquaintance
:
 
<EOS>
I
love
to
be
the
worst
of
the
company
:
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
of
those
that
say
,
"
For
want
of
company
,
welcome
trumpery
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
was
this
evening
with
Lady
Kerry
and
Mrs.
Pratt
at
Vauxhall
,
to
hear
the
nightingales
;
but
they
are
almost
past
singing
.
  
<EOS>
18
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
hunting
the
Secretary
to
-
day
in
vain
about
some
business
,
and
dined
with
Colonel
Crowe
,
late
Governor
of
Barbados
,
and
your
friend
Sterne
was
the
third
:
 
<EOS>
he
is
very
kind
to
Sterne
,
and
helps
him
in
his
business
,
which
lies
asleep
till
Mr.
Harley
is
Lord
Treasurer
,
because
nothing
of
moment
is
now
done
in
the
Treasury
,
the
change
being
expected
every
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
sat
with
Dean
Atterbury
till
one
o'clock
after
I
came
home
;
so
'
tis
late
,
etc
.
  
<EOS>

.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
know
that
about
our
town
we
are
mowing
already
and
making
hay
,
and
it
smells
so
sweet
as
we
walk
through
the
flowery
meads
;
but
the
hay
-
making
nymphs
are
perfect
drabs
,
nothing
so
clean
and
pretty
as
farther
in
the
country
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
a
mighty
increase
of
dirty
wenches
in
straw
hats
since
I
knew
London
.
 
<EOS>
I
stayed
at
home
till
five
o'clock
,
and
dined
with
Dean
Atterbury
;
then
went
by
water
to
Mr.
Harley
's
,
where
the
Saturday
Club
was
met
,
with
the
addition
of
the
Duke
of
Shrewsbury
.
 
<EOS>
I
whispered
Lord
Rivers
that
I
did
not
like
to
see
a
stranger
among
us
;
and
the
rogue
told
it
aloud
:
but
Mr.
Secretary
said
the
Duke
writ
to
have
leave
;
so
I
appeared
satisfied
,
and
so
we
laughed
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Secretary
told
me
the
Duke
of
Buckingham
had
been
talking
to
him
much
about
me
,
and
desired
my
acquaintance
.
 
<EOS>
I
answered
it
could
not
be
,
for
he
had
not
made
sufficient
advances
.
 
<EOS>
Then
the
Duke
of
Shrewsbury
said
he
thought
that
Duke
was
not
used
to
make
advances
.
 
<EOS>
I
said
I
could
not
help
that
;
for
I
always
expected
advances
in
proportion
to
men
's
quality
,
and
more
from
a
duke
than
any
other
man
.
 
<EOS>
The
Duke
replied
that
he
did
not
mean
anything
of
his
quality
;
which
was
handsomely
said
enough
;
for
he
meant
his
pride
:
 
<EOS>
and
I
have
invented
a
notion
to
believe
that
nobody
is
proud
.
 
<EOS>
At
ten
all
the
company
went
away
;
and
from
ten
to
twelve
Mr.
Harley
and
I
sat
together
,
where
we
talked
through
a
great
deal
of
matters
<EOS>
I
had
a
mind
to
settle
with
him
;
and
then
walked
in
a
fine
moonshine
night
to
Chelsea
,
where
I
got
by
one
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Rivers
conjured
me
not
to
walk
so
late
;
but
I
would
,
because
I
had
no
other
way
;
but
I
had
no
money
to
lose
.
  
<EOS>
20
.
 
<EOS>
By
what
the
Lord
Keeper
told
me
last
night
,
I
find
he
will
not
be
made
a
peer
so
soon
;
but
Mr.
Harley
's
patent
for
Earl
of
Oxford
is
now
drawing
,
and
will
be
done
in
three
days
.
 
<EOS>
We
made
him
own
it
,
which
he
did
scurvily
,
and
then
talked
of
it
like
the
rest
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Secretary
had
too
much
company
with
him
to
-
day
;
so
I
came
away
soon
after
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
I
give
no
man
liberty
to
swear
or
talk
b####dy
,
and
I
found
some
of
them
were
in
constraint
,
so
I
left
them
to
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
you
a
merry
Whitsuntide
,
and
pray
tell
me
how
you
pass
away
your
time
;
but
,
faith
,
you
are
going
to
Wexford
,
and
I
fear
this
letter
is
too
late
;
it
shall
go
on
Thursday
,
and
sooner
it
can
not
<EOS>
,
I
have
so
much
business
to
hinder
me
answering
yours
.
 
<EOS>
Where
must
I
direct
in
your
absence
?
<EOS>
Do
you
quit
your
lodgings
?
  
<EOS>

<EOS>
Going
to
town
this
morning
,
I
met
in
the
Pall
Mall
a
clergyman
of
Ireland
,
whom
I
love
very
well
and
was
glad
to
see
,
and
with
him
a
little
jackanapes
,
of
Ireland
too
,
who
married
Nanny
Swift
,
Uncle
Adam
's
daughter
,
one
Perry
<EOS>
;
perhaps
you
may
have
heard
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
His
wife
has
sent
him
here
,
to
get
a
place
from
Lowndes
;
because
my
uncle
and
Lowndes
married
two
sisters
,
and
Lowndes
is
a
great
man
here
in
the
Treasury
;
but
by
good
luck
I
have
no
acquaintance
with
him
:
 
<EOS>
however
,
he
expected
I
should
be
his
friend
to
Lowndes
,
and
one
word
of
mine
,
etc
.
,
the
old
ca
nt
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
will
not
go
two
yards
to
help
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
with
Mrs.
Vanhomrigh
,
where
I
keep
my
best
gown
and
periwig
,
to
put
on
when
I
come
to
town
and
be
a
spark
.
  
<EOS>
22
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
to
-
day
in
the
City
,
and
coming
home
this
evening
,
I
met
Sir
Thomas
Mansel
and
Mr.
Lewis
in
the
Park
.
 
<EOS>
Lewis
whispered
me
that
Mr.
Harley
's
patent
for
the
Earl
of
Oxford
was
passed
in
Mr.
Secretary
St.
John
's
office
;
so
to
-
morrow
or
<EOS>
next
day
,
I
suppose
,
he
will
be
declared
Earl
of
Oxford
,
and
have
the
staff
.
 
<EOS>
This
man
has
grown
by
persecutions
,
turnings
out
,
and
stabbing
.
 
<EOS>
What
waiting
,
and
crowding
,
and
bowing
will
be
at
his
levee
!
<EOS>
yet
,
if
human
nature
be
capable
of
so
much
constancy
,
I
should
believe
he
will
be
the
same
man
still
,
bating
the
necessary
forms
of
grandeur
he
must
keep
up
.
'
<EOS>
Tis
late
,
sirrahs
,
and
I
'll
go
sleep
.
  
<EOS>
23
.
 
<EOS>
Morning
.
 
<EOS>
I
sat
up
late
last
night
,
and
waked
late
to
-
day
;
but
will
now
answer
your
letter
in
bed
before
I
go
to
town
,
and
I
will
send
it
to
-
morrow
;
for
perhaps
you
may
n't
go
so
soon
to
Wexford
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
you
are
not
out
in
your
number
;
the
last
was
Number
14
,
and
so
I
told
you
twice
or
thrice
;
will
you
never
be
satisfied
?
 
<EOS>
What
shall
we
do
for
poor
Stella
?
 
<EOS>
Go
to
Wexford
,
for
God
's
sake
:
 
<EOS>
I
wish
you
were
to
walk
there
by
three
miles
a
day
,
with
a
good
lodging
at
every
mile
's
end
.
 
<EOS>
Walking
has
done
me
so
much
good
,
that
I
can
not
but
prescribe
it
often
to
poor
Stella
.
 
<EOS>
Parvisol
has
sent
me
a
bill
for
fifty
pounds
,
which
I
am
sorry
for
,
having
not
written
to
him
for
it
,
only
mentioned
it
two
months
ago
;
but
I
hope
he
will
be
able
to
pay
you
what
I
have
drawn
upon
him
for
:
 
<EOS>
he
never
sent
me
any
sum
before
,
but
one
bill
of
twenty
pounds
half
a
year
ago
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
welcome
as
my
blood
to
every
farthing
I
have
in
the
world
;
and
all
that
grieves
me
is
,
I
am
not
richer
,
for
MD
's
sake
,
as
hope
saved
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
you
give
up
your
lodgings
when
you
go
to
Wexford
;
yet
that
will
be
inconvenient
too
:
 
yet
<EOS>
I
wish
again
you
were
under
a
necessity
of
rambling
the
country
until
Michaelmas
,
faith
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
let
them
keep
the
shelves
,
with
a
pox
;
yet
they
are
exacting
people
about
those
four
weeks
;
or
Mrs.
Brent
may
have
the
shelves
,
if
she
please
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
obliged
to
your
Dean
for
his
kind
offer
of
lending
me
money
.
 
<EOS>
Will
that
be
enough
to
say
?
 
<EOS>
A
hundred
people
would
lend
me
money
,
or
to
any
man
who
has
not
the
reputation
of
a
squanderer
.
<EOS>
O
,
faith
,
I
should
be
glad
to
be
in
the
same
kingdom
with
MD
,
however
,
although
you
are
at
Wexford
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
am
kept
here
by
a
most
capricious
fate
,
which
I
would
break
through
,
if
I
could
do
it
with
decency
or
honour
.
 
<EOS>
To
return
without
some
mark
of
distinction
would
look
extremely
little
;
and
I
would
likewise
gladly
be
somewhat
richer
than
I
am
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
say
no
more
,
but
beg
you
to
be
easy
till
Fortune
take
her
course
,
and
to
believe
that
MD
's
felicity
is
the
great
end
I
aim
at
in
all
my
pursuits
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
let
us
talk
no
more
on
this
subject
,
which
makes
me
melancholy
,
and
that
I
would
fain
divert
.
<EOS>
Believe
me
,
no
man
breathing
at
present
has
less
share
of
happiness
in
life
than
I
:
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
say
I
am
unhappy
at
all
,
but
that
everything
here
is
tasteless
to
me
for
want
of
being
as
I
would
be
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
,
a
short
sigh
,
and
no
more
of
this
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
come
and
let
's
see
what
's
next
,
young
women
.
 
<EOS>
Pox
take
Mrs.
Edgworth
and
Sterne
!
 
<EOS>
I
will
take
some
methods
about
that
box
.
 
<EOS>
What
orders
would
you
have
me
give
about
the
picture
?
 
<EOS>
Ca
n't
you
do
with
it
as
if
it
were
your
own
?
 
<EOS>
No
,
I
hope
Manley
will
keep
his
place
;
for
I
hear
nothing
of
Sir
Thomas
Frankland
's
losing
his
.
 
<EOS>
Send
nothing
under
cover
to
Mr.
Addison
,
but
"
To
Erasmus
Lewis
,
Esq
.
<EOS>
;
at
my
Lord
Dartmouth
's
office
at
Whitehall
.
"
 
<EOS>
Direct
your
outside
so
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
dear
Stella
,
do
n't
write
in
the
dark
,
nor
in
the
light
neither
,
but
dictate
to
Dingley
;
she
is
a
naughty
,
healthy
girl
,
and
may
drudge
for
both
.
 
<EOS>
Are
you
good
company
together
?
<EOS>
and
do
n't
you
quarrel
too
often
?
 
<EOS>
Pray
love
one
another
,
and
kiss
one
another
just
now
,
as
Dingley
is
reading
this
;
for
you
quarrelled
this
morning
just
after
Mrs.
Marget
had
poured
water
on
Stella
's
head
:
 
<EOS>
I
heard
the
little
bird
say
so
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
I
have
answered
everything
in
your
letter
that
required
it
,
and
yet
the
second
side
is
not
full
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
come
home
at
night
,
and
say
more
;
and
to
-
morrow
this
goes
for
certain
.
 
<EOS>
Go
,
get
you
gone
to
your
own
chambers
,
and
let
Presto
rise
like
a
modest
gentleman
,
and
walk
to
town
.
 
<EOS>
I
fancy
<EOS>
I
begin
to
sweat
less
in
the
forehead
by
constant
walking
than
I
used
to
do
;
<EOS>
but
then
I
shall
be
so
sunburnt
,
the
ladies
will
not
like
me
.
 
<EOS>
Come
,
let
me
rise
,
sirrahs
.
 
<EOS>
Morrow

At
night
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
with
Ford
to
-
day
at
his
lodgings
,
and
I
found
wine
out
of
my
own
cellar
<EOS>
,
some
of
my
own
chest
of
the
great
Duke
's
wine
:
 
it
begins
to
turn
.
 
<EOS>
They
say
wine
with
you
in
Ireland
is
half
a
crown
a
bottle
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
as
Stella
says
;
nothing
that
once
grows
dear
in
Ireland
ever
grows
cheap
again
,
except
corn
,
with
a
pox
,
to
ruin
the
parson
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
a
letter
to
-
day
from
the
Archbishop
of
Dublin
,
giving
me
further
thanks
about
vindicating
him
to
Mr.
Harley
and
Mr.
St.
John
,
and
telling
me
a
long
story
about
your
Mayor
's
election
<EOS>
,
wherein
I
find
he
has
had
a
finger
,
and
given
way
to
further
talk
about
him
;
but
we
know
nothing
of
it
here
yet
.
 
<EOS>
This
walking
to
and
fro
,
and
dressing
myself
,
takes
up
so
much
of
my
time
that
I
can
not
go
among
company
so
much
as
formerly
;
yet
what
must
a
body
do
?
 
<EOS>
I
thank
God
I
yet
continue
much
better
since
I
left
the
town
;
I
know
not
how
long
it
may
last
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
sure
it
has
done
me
some
good
for
the
present
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
totter
as
I
did
,
but
walk
firm
as
a
cock
,
only
once
or
twice
for
a
minute
<EOS>
,
I
do
not
know
how
;
but
it
went
off
,
and
I
never
followed
it
.
 
<EOS>
Does
Dingley
read
my
hand
as
well
as
ever
?
<EOS>
do
you
,
sirrah
?
 
<EOS>
Poor
Stella
must
not
read
Presto
's
ugly
small
hand
.
       
<EOS>
Preserve
your
eyes
,
     
<EOS>
If
you
be
wise
.
  
<EOS>
Your
friend
Walls
's
tea
will
go
in
a
day
or
two
towards
Chester
by
one
Parson
Richardson
.
 
<EOS>
My
humble
service
to
her
,
and
to
good
Mrs.
Stoyte
,
and
Catherine
;
and
pray
walk
while
you
continue
in
Dublin
.
 
<EOS>
I
expect
your
next
but
one
will
be
from
Wexford
.
 
<EOS>
God
bless

Morning

<EOS>
Mr.
Secretary
has
sent
his
groom
hither
,
to
invite
me
to
dinner
to

<EOS>
God
Almighty
for
ever

you
both

give
you
health

<EOS>
Amen

Farewell

<EOS>
Do
not
I
often
say
the
same
thing
two
or
three
times
in
the
same
letter
,
sirrah

<EOS>
Great

short

that

CHELSEA

May

.
  
<EOS>
Morning
.
 
<EOS>
Once
in
my
life
the
number
of
my
letters
and
of
the
day
of
the
month
is
the
same
;
that
's
lucky
,
boys
;
that
's
a
sign
that
things
will
meet
,
and
that
we
shall
make
a
figure
together
.
 
<EOS>
What
,
will
you
still
have
the
impudence
to
say
London
,
England
,
because
I
say
Dublin
,
Ireland
?
 
<EOS>
Is
there
no
difference
between
London
and
Dublin
,
saucyboxes
?
 
<EOS>
I
have
sealed
up
my
letter
,
and
am
going
to
town
.
 
<EOS>
Morrow
,
sirrahs
.
 
<EOS>
At
night
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
with
the
Secretary
to
-
day
;
we
sat
down
between
five
and
six
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Harley
's
patent
passed
this
morning
:
 
<EOS>
he
is
now
Earl
of
Oxford
,
Earl
Mortimer
,
and
Lord
Harley
of
Wigmore
Castle
.
 
<EOS>
My
letter
was
sealed
,
or
I
would
have
told
you
this
yesterday
;
but
the
public
news
may
tell
it
you
.
 
<EOS>
The
Queen
,
for
all
her
favour
,
has
kept
a
rod
for
him
in
her
closet
this
week
;
I
suppose
he
will
take
it
from
her
,
though
,
in
a
day
or
two
.
 
<EOS>
At
eight
o'clock
this
evening
it
rained
prodigiously
,
as
it
did
from
five
;
however
,
I
set
out
,
and
in
half
-
way
the
rain
lessened
,
and
I
got
home
,
but
tolerably
wet
;
and
this
is
the
first
wet
walk
I
have
had
in
a
month
's
time
that
I
am
here
<EOS>
but
,
however
,
I
got
to
bed
,
after
a
short
visit
to
Atterbury
.
  
<EOS>
25
.
 
<EOS>
It
rained
this
morning
,
and
I
went
to
town
by
water
;
and
Ford
and
I
dined
with
Mr.
Lewis
by
appointment
.
 
<EOS>
I
ordered
Patrick
to
bring
my
gown
and
periwig
to
Mr.
Lewis
,
because
I
designed
to
go
to
see
Lord
Oxford
,
and
so
I
told
the
dog
;
but
he
never
came
,
though
I
stayed
an
hour
longer
than
I
appointed
;
so
I
went
in
my
old
gown
,
and
sat
with
him
two
hours
,
but
could
not
talk
over
some
business
I
had
with
him
;
so
he
has
desired
me
to
dine
with
him
on
Sunday
,
and
I
must
disappoint
the
Secretary
.
 
<EOS>
My
lord
set
me
down
at
a
coffee
-
house
,
where
I
waited
for
the
Dean
of
Carlisle
's
chariot
to
bring
me
to
Chelsea
;
for
it
has
rained
prodigiously
all
this
afternoon
.
 
<EOS>
The
Dean
did
not
come
himself
,
but
sent
me
his
chariot
,
which
has
cost
me
two
shillings
to
the
coachman
;
and
so
I
am
got
home
,
and
Lord
knows
what
is
become
of
Patrick
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
must
send
him
over
to
you
;
for
he
is
an
intolerable
rascal
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
had
come
without
a
gown
,
he
would
have
served
me
so
,
though
my
life
and
preferment
should
have
lain
upon
it
:
 
and
I
am
making
a
livery
for
him
will
cost
me
four
pounds
;
but
I
will
order
the
tailor
to
-
morrow
to
stop
till
further
orders
.
 
<EOS>
My
Lord
Oxford
ca
n't
yet
abide
to
be
called
"
my
lord
"
;
and
when
I
called
him
"
my
lord
,
"
he
called
me
"
Dr.
Thomas
Swift
,
"
which
he
always
does
when
he
has
a
mind
to
tease
me
.
 
<EOS>
By
a
second
hand
,
he
proposed
my
being
his
chaplain
,
which
I
by
a
second
hand
excused
;
but
we
had
no
talk
of
it
to
-
day
:
 
but
I
will
be
no
man
's
chaplain
alive
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
must
go
and
be
busy
.
  
<EOS>
26
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
saw
Patrick
till
this
morning
,
and
that
only
once
,
for
I
dressed
myself
without
him
;
and
when
I
went
to
town
he
was
out
of
the
way
.
 
<EOS>
I
immediately
sent
for
the
tailor
,
and
ordered
him
to
stop
his
hand
in
Patrick
's
clothes
till
further
orders
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
if
it
were
in
Ireland
,
I
should
have
turned
him
off
ten
times
ago
;
and
it
is
no
regard
to
him
,
but
myself
,
that
has
made
me
keep
him
so
long
.
 
<EOS>
Now
I
am
afraid
to
give
the
rogue
his
clothes
.
 
<EOS>
What
shall
I
do
?
 
<EOS>
I
wish
MD
were
here
to
entreat
for
him
,
just
here
at
the
bed
's
side
.
 
<EOS>
Lady
Ashburnham
has
been
engaging
me
this
long
time
to
dine
with
her
,
and
I
set
to
-
day
apart
for
it
;
and
whatever
was
the
mistake
,
she
sent
me
word
she
was
at
dinner
and
undressed
,
but
would
be
glad
to
see
me
in
the
afternoon
:
 
<EOS>
so
I
dined
with
Mrs.
Vanhomrigh
,
and
would
not
go
to
see
her
at
all
,
in
a
huff
.
 
<EOS>
My
fine
Florence
is
turning
sour
with
a
vengeance
,
and
I
have
not
drunk
half
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
As
I
was
coming
home
to
-
night
,
Sir
Thomas
Mansel
and
Tom
Harley
met
me
in
the
Park
,
and
made
me
walk
with
them
till
nine
,
like
unreasonable
whelps
;
<EOS>
so
I
got
not
here
till
ten
:
 
<EOS>
but
it
was
a
fine
evening
,
and
the
foot
-
path
clean
enough
already
after
this
hard
rain
.
  
<EOS>
27
.
 
<EOS>
Going
this
morning
to
town
,
I
saw
two
old
lame
fellows
,
walking
to
a
brandy
-
shop
,
and
when
they
got
to
the
door
,
stood
a
long
time
complimenting
who
should
go
in
first
.
 
<EOS>
Though
this
be
no
jest
to
tell
,
it
was
an
admirable
one
to
see
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
to
-
day
with
my
Lord
Oxford
and
the
ladies
,
the
new
Countess
,
and
Lady
Betty
,
who
has
been
these
three
days
a
lady
born
.
 
<EOS>
My
lord
left
us
at
seven
,
and
I
had
no
time
to
speak
to
him
about
some
affairs
;
but
he
promises
in
a
day
or
two
we
shall
dine
alone
;
which
is
mighty
likely
,
considering
we
expect
every
moment
that
the
Queen
will
give
him
the
staff
,
and
then
he
will
be
so
crowded
he
will
be
good
for
nothing
:
 
for
aught
<EOS>
I
know
he
may
have
it
to
-
night
at
Council
.
  
<EOS>
28
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
a
petition
sent
me
t'other
day
from
one
Stephen
Gernon
,
setting
forth
that
he
formerly
lived
with
Harry
Tenison
,
who
gave
him
an
employment
of
gauger
,
and
that
he
was
turned
out
after
Harry
's
death
,
and
came
for
England
,
and
is
now
starving
,
or
,
as
he
expresses
it
,
<EOS>
THAT
THE
STAFF
OF
LIFE
HAS
BEEN
OF
LATE
A
STRANGER
TO
HIS
APPETITE
.
 
<EOS>
Today
the
poor
fellow
called
,
and
I
knew
him
very
well
,
a
young
slender
fellow
with
freckles
in
his
face
:
you
must
remember
him
;
he
waited
at
table
as
a
better
sort
of
servant
.
 
<EOS>
I
gave
him
a
crown
,
and
promised
to
do
what
I
could
to
help
him
to
a
service
,
which
I
did
for
Harry
Tenison
's
memory
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
bloody
hot
walking
to
-
day
,
and
I
was
so
lazy
<EOS>
I
dined
where
my
new
gown
was
,
at
Mrs.
Vanhomrigh
's
,
and
came
back
like
a
fool
,
and
the
Dean
of
Carlisle
has
sat
with
me
till
eleven
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Oxford
has
not
the
staff
yet
.
  
<EOS>
29
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
this
morning
in
town
by
ten
,
though
it
was
shaving
-
day
,
and
went
to
the
Secretary
about
some
affairs
,
then
visited
the
Duke
and
Duchess
of
Ormond
;
but
the
latter
was
dressing
to
go
out
,
and
I
could
not
see
her
.
 
<EOS>
My
Lord
Oxford
had
the
staff
given
him
this
morning
;
so
now
I
must
call
him
Lord
Oxford
no
more
,
but
Lord
Treasurer
:
 
<EOS>
I
hope
he
will
stick
there
:
 
<EOS>
this
is
twice
he
has
changed
his
name
this
week
;
and
I
heard
to
-
day
in
the
City
(
where
I
dined
)
that
he
will
very
soon
have
the
Garter
.
 
<EOS>
Pr'ythee
,
do
not
you
observe
how
strangely
I
have
changed
my
company
and
manner
of
living
?
 
<EOS>
I
never
go
to
a
coffee
-
house
;
you
hear
no
more
of
Addison
,
Steele
,
Henley
,
Lady
Lucy
,
Mrs.
Finch
,
Lord
Somers
,
Lord
Halifax
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
have
altered
for
the
better
.
 
<EOS>
Did
I
tell
you
the
Archbishop
of
Dublin
has
writ
me
a
long
letter
of
a
squabble
in
your
town
about
choosing
a
Mayor
,
and
that
he
apprehended
some
censure
for
the
share
he
had
in
it
?
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
heard
anything
of
it
here
;
but
I
shall
not
be
always
able
to
defend
him
.
 
<EOS>
We
hear
your
Bishop
Hickman
is
dead
;
but
nobody
here
will
do
anything
for
me
in
Ireland
;
so
they
may
die
as
fast
or
slow
as
they
please
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
you
are
constant
to
your
deans
,
and
your
Stoyte
,
and
your
Walls
.
 
<EOS>
Walls
will
have
her
tea
soon
;
Parson
Richardson
is
either
going
or
gone
to
Ireland
,
and
has
it
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
hear
Mr.
Lewis
has
two
letters
for
me
:
 
I
could
not
call
for
them
to
-
day
,
but
will
to
-
morrow
;
and
perhaps
one
of
them
may
be
from
our
little
MD
,
who
knows
,
man
?
<EOS>
who
can
tell
?
<EOS>
Many
a
more
unlikely
thing
has
happened
.
 
<EOS>
Pshaw
,
I
write
so
plaguy
little
,
I
can
hardly
see
it
myself
.
 
<EOS>
WRITE
BIGGER
,
SIRRAH
Presto
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
<EOS>
but
I
wo
n't
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
you
are
a
saucy
rogue
,
Mr.
Presto
,
you
are
so
impudent
.
 
<EOS>
Come
,
dear
rogues
,
let
Presto
go
to
sleep
;
I
have
been
with
the
Dean
,
and
'
tis
near
twelve
.
  
<EOS>

.
 
<EOS>
I
am
so
hot
and
lazy
after
my
morning
's
walk
,
that
I
loitered
at
Mrs.
Vanhomrigh
's
,
where
my
best
gown
and
periwig
are
,
and
out
of
mere
listlessness
dine
there
very
often
;
so
I
did
to
-
day
;
but
I
got
little
MD
's
letter
,
N.15
<EOS>
(
you
see
,
sirrahs
,
I
remember
to
tell
the
number
)
,
from
Mr.
Lewis
,
and
I
read
it
in
a
closet
they
lend
me
at
Mrs.
Van
's
;
and
I
find
Stella
is
a
saucy
rogue
and
a
great
writer
,
and
can
write
finely
still
when
her
hand
is
in
,
and
her
pen
good
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
came
here
to
-
night
,
I
had
a
mighty
mind
to
go
swim
after
I
was
cool
,
for
my
lodging
is
just
by
the
river
;
and
I
went
down
with
only
my
nightgown
and
slippers
on
at
eleven
,
but
came
up
again
;
however
,
one
of
these
nights
I
will
venture
.
  
<EOS>
31
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
so
hot
this
morning
with
my
walk
,
that
I
resolve
to
do
so
no
more
during
this
violent
burning
weather
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
comical
that
now
we
happen
to
have
such
heat
to
ripen
the
fruit
there
has
been
the
greatest
blast
that
was
ever
known
,
and
almost
all
the
fruit
is
despaired
of
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
with
Lord
Shelburne
:
<EOS>
Lady
Kerry
and
Mrs.
Pratt
are
going
to
Ireland
.
 
<EOS>
I
went
this
evening
to
Lord
Treasurer
,
and
sat
about
two
hours
with
him
in
mixed
company
;
he
left
us
,
and
went
to
Court
,
and
carried
two
staves
with
him
,
so
I
suppose
we
shall
have
a
new
Lord
Steward
or
Comptroller
to
-
morrow
;
I
smoked
that
State
secret
out
by
that
accident
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
not
answer
your
letter
yet
,
sirrahs
;
<EOS>
no
I
wo
n't
,
madam
.
  
<EOS>
June
1
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
you
a
merry
month
of
June
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
again
with
the
Vans
and
Sir
Andrew
Fountaine
.
 
<EOS>
I
always
give
them
a
flask
of
my
Florence
,
which
now
begins
to
spoil
,
but
it
is
near
an
end
.
 
<EOS>
I
went
this
afternoon
to
Mrs.
Vedeau
's
,
and
brought
away
Madam
Dingley
's
parchment
and
letter
of
attorney
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Vedeau
tells
me
she
has
sent
the
bill
a
fortnight
ago
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
give
the
parchment
to
Ben
Tooke
,
and
you
shall
send
him
a
letter
of
attorney
at
your
leisure
,
enclosed
to
Mr.
Presto
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
I
now
think
your
mackerel
is
full
as
good
as
ours
,
which
I
did
not
think
formerly
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
bit
about
two
staves
,
for
there
is
no
new
officer
made
to
-
day
.
 
<EOS>
This
letter
will
find
you
still
in
Dublin
,
I
suppose
,
or
at
Donnybrook
,
or
losing
your
money
at
Walls
'
(
how
does
she
do
?
)
.
  
<EOS>

.
 
<EOS>
I
missed
this
day
by
a
blunder
and
dining
in
the
City
.
  
<EOS>
3
.
 
<EOS>
No
boats
on
Sunday
,
never
:
 
<EOS>
so
I
was
forced
to
walk
,
and
so
hot
by
the
time
I
got
to
Ford
's
lodging
<EOS>
that
I
was
quite
spent
<EOS>
;
I
think
the
weather
is
mad
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
go
to
church
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
with
the
Secretary
as
usual
,
and
old
Colonel
Graham
that
lived
at
Bagshot
Heath
,
and
they
said
it
was
Colonel
Graham
's
house
.
 
<EOS>
Pshaw
,
I
remember
it
very
well
,
when
I
used
to
go
for
a
walk
to
London
from
Moor
Park
.
 
<EOS>
What
,
I
warrant
you
do
not
remember
the
Golden
Farmer
neither
,
figgarkick
soley
?
  
<EOS>

.
 
<EOS>
When
must
we
answer
this
letter
,
this
N.15
of
our
little
MD
?
 
<EOS>
Heat
and
laziness
,
and
Sir
Andrew
Fountaine
,
made
me
dine
to
-
day
again
at
Mrs.
Van
's
;
and
,
in
short
,
this
weather
is
unsupportable
:
 
<EOS>
how
is
it
with
you
?
 
<EOS>
Lady
Betty
Butler
and
Lady
Ashburnham
sat
with
me
two
or
three
hours
this
evening
in
my
closet
at
Mrs.
Van
's
.
 
<EOS>
They
are
very
good
girls
;
and
if
Lady
Betty
went
to
Ireland
,
you
should
let
her
be
acquainted
with
you
.
 
<EOS>
How
does
Dingley
do
this
hot
weather
?
 
<EOS>
Stella
,
I
think
,
never
complains
of
it
;
she
loves
hot
weather
.
<EOS>
There
has
not
been
a
drop
of
rain
since
Friday
se'ennight
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
you
do
love
hot
weather
,
<EOS>
naughty
Stella
,
you
do
so
;
and
Presto
ca
n't
abide
it
.
 
<EOS>
Be
a
good
girl
then
,
and
I
will
love
you
;
and
love
one
another
,
and
do
n't
be
quarrelling
girls
.
  
<EOS>

.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
in
the
City
to
-
day
,
and
went
from
hence
early
to
town
,
and
visited
the
Duke
of
Ormond
and
Mr.
Secretary
.
 
<EOS>
They
say
my
Lord
Treasurer
has
a
dead
warrant
in
his
pocket
;
they
mean
a
list
of
those
who
are
to
be
turned
out
of
employment
;
and
we
every
day
now
expect
those
changes
.
 
<EOS>
I
passed
by
the
Treasury
to
-
day
,
and
saw
vast
crowds
waiting
to
give
Lord
Treasurer
petitions
as
he
passes
by
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
now
at
the
top
of
power
and
favour
:
 
<EOS>
he
keeps
no
levees
yet
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
cruel
thirsty
this
hot
weather
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
just
this
minute
going
to
swim
.
 
<EOS>
I
take
Patrick
down
with
me
,
to
hold
my
nightgown
,
shirt
,
and
slippers
,
and
borrow
a
napkin
of
my
landlady
for
a
cap
.
 
<EOS>
So
farewell
till
I
come
up
;
but
there
is
no
danger
,
do
n't
be
frighted
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
swimming
this
half
-
hour
and
more
;
and
when
I
was
coming
out
I
dived
,
to
make
my
head
and
all
through
wet
,
like
a
cold
bath
;
but
,
as
I
dived
,
the
napkin
fell
off
and
is
lost
,
and
I
have
that
to
pay
for
.
 
<EOS>
O
,
faith
,
the
great
stones
were
so
sharp
<EOS>
,
I
could
hardly
set
my
feet
on
them
as
I
came
out
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
pure
and
warm
.
 
<EOS>
I
got
to
bed
,
and
will
now
go
sleep
.
  
<EOS>
6
.
 
<EOS>
Morning
.
 
<EOS>
This
letter
shall
go
to
-
morrow
;
so
I
will
answer
yours
when
I
come
home
to
-
night
.
 
<EOS>
I
feel
no
hurt
from
last
night
's
swimming
.
 
<EOS>
I
lie
with
nothing
but
the
sheet
over
me
,
and
my
feet
quite
bare
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
rise
and
go
to
town
before
the
tide
is
against
me
.
 
<EOS>
Morrow
,
sirrahs
;
dear
sirrahs
,
morrow
.
  
<EOS>
At
night
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
felt
so
hot
a
day
as
this
since
I
was
born
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
with
Lady
Betty
Germaine
,
and
there
was
the
young
Earl
of
Berkeley
and
his
fine
lady
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
saw
her
before
,
nor
think
her
near
so
handsome
as
she
passes
for
.
 
<EOS>
After
dinner
,
Mr.
Bertue
would
not
let
me
put
ice
in
my
wine
,
but
said
my
Lord
Dorchester
got
the
bloody
flux
with
it
,
and
that
it
was
the
worst
thing
in
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
are
we
plagued
,
thus
are
we
plagued
;
yet
I
have
done
it
five
or
six
times
this
summer
,
and
was
but
the
drier
and
the
hotter
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
makes
me
so
excessively
peevish
as
hot
weather
.
 
<EOS>
Lady
Berkeley
after
dinner
clapped
my
hat
on
another
lady
's
head
,
and
she
in
roguery
put
it
upon
the
rails
.
 
<EOS>
I
minded
them
not
;
but
in
two
minutes
they
called
me
to
the
window
,
and
Lady
Carteret
showed
me
my
hat
out
of
her
window
five
doors
off
,
where
I
was
forced
to
walk
to
it
,
and
pay
her
and
old
Lady
Weymouth
a
visit
,
with
some
more
beldames
.
 
<EOS>
Then
I
went
and
drank
coffee
,
and
made
one
or
two
puns
,
with
Lord
Pembroke
,
and
designed
to
go
to
Lord
Treasurer
;
but
it
was
too
late
,
and
beside
I
was
half
broiled
,
and
broiled
without
butter
;
for
I
never
sweat
after
dinner
,
if
I
drink
any
wine
.
<EOS>
Then
I
sat
an
hour
with
Lady
Betty
Butler
at
tea
,
and
everything
made
me
hotter
and
drier
.
 
<EOS>
Then
I
walked
home
,
and
was
here
by
ten
,
so
miserably
hot
,
that
I
was
in
as
perfect
a
passion
as
ever
<EOS>
I
was
in
my
life
at
the
greatest
affront
or
provocation
.
 
<EOS>
Then
I
sat
an
hour
,
till
I
was
quite
dry
and
cool
enough
to
go
swim
;
which
I
did
,
but
with
so
much
vexation
that
I
think
I
have
given
it
over
:
 
for
I
was
every
moment
disturbed
by
boats
,
rot
them
;
and
that
puppy
Patrick
,
standing
ashore
,
would
let
them
come
within
a
yard
or
two
,
and
then
call
sneakingly
to
them
.
 
<EOS>
The
only
comfort
I
proposed
here
in
hot
weather
is
gone
;
for
there
is
no
jesting
with
those
boats
after
it
is
dark
:
 
<EOS>
I
had
none
last
night
.
 
<EOS>
I
dived
to
dip
my
head
,
and
held
my
cap
on
with
both
my
hands
,
for
fear
of
losing
it
.
 
<EOS>
Pox
take
the
boats
!
 
<EOS>
Amen
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
near
twelve
,
and
<EOS>
so
I
'll
answer
your
letter
<EOS>
(
it
strikes
twelve
now
)
to
-
morrow
morning
.
  
<EOS>
7
.
 
<EOS>
Morning
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
now
let
us
answer
MD
's
letter
,
N.15
,
15
,
15
,
15
.
 
<EOS>
Now
have
I
told
you
the
number
?
 
<EOS>
15
,
15
;
there
,
impudence
,
to
call
names
in
the
beginning
of
your
letter
,
before
you
say
,
How
do
you
do
,
Mr.
Presto
?
 
<EOS>
There
is
your
breeding
!
 
<EOS>
Where
is
your
manners
,
sirrah
,
to
a
gentleman
?
 
<EOS>
Get
<EOS>
you
gone
,
you
couple
of
jades
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
I
never
sit
up
late
now
;
but
this
abominable
hot
weather
will
force
me
to
eat
or
drink
something
that
will
do
me
hurt
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
venture
to
eat
a
few
strawberries
.
 
<EOS>
Why
then
,
do
you
know
in
Ireland
that
Mr.
St.
John
talked
so
in
Parliament
?
 
<EOS>
Your
Whigs
are
plaguily
bit
;
for
he
is
entirely
for
their
being
all
out
.
 
<EOS>
And
are
you
as
vicious
in
snuff
as
ever
?
 
<EOS>
I
believe
,
as
you
say
,
it
does
neither
hurt
nor
good
;
but
I
have
left
it
off
,
and
when
anybody
offers
me
their
box
,
I
take
about
a
tenth
part
of
what
I
used
to
do
,
and
then
just
smell
to
it
,
and
privately
fling
the
rest
away
.
 
<EOS>
I
keep
to
my
tobacco
still
,
as
you
say
;
but
even
much
less
of
that
than
formerly
,
only
mornings
and
evenings
,
and
very
seldom
in
the
day
.
 
<EOS>
As
for
Joe
,
I
have
recommended
his
case
heartily
to
my
Lord
Lieutenant
;
and
,
by
his
direction
,
given
a
memorial
of
it
to
Mr.
Southwell
,
to
whom
I
have
recommended
it
likewise
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
do
no
more
,
if
he
were
my
brother
.
 
<EOS>
His
business
will
be
to
apply
himself
to
Southwell
.
 
<EOS>
And
you
must
desire
Raymond
,
if
Price
of
Galway
comes
to
town
,
to
desire
him
to
wait
on
Mr.
Southwell
,
as
recommended
by
me
for
one
of
the
Duke
's
chaplains
,
which
was
all
I
could
do
for
him
;
and
he
must
be
presented
to
the
Duke
,
and
make
his
court
,
and
ply
about
,
and
find
out
some
vacancy
,
and
solicit
early
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
The
bustle
about
your
Mayor
<EOS>
I
had
before
,
as
I
told
you
,
from
the
Archbishop
of
Dublin
.
 
<EOS>
Was
Raymond
not
come
till
May
18
?
 
<EOS>
So
he
says
fine
things
of
me
?
 
<EOS>
Certainly
he
lies
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
sure
I
used
him
indifferently
enough
;
and
we
never
once
dined
together
,
or
walked
,
or
were
in
any
third
place
;
only
he
came
sometimes
to
my
lodgings
,
and
even
there
was
oftener
denied
than
admitted
.
 
<EOS>
What
an
odd
bill
is
that
you
sent
of
Raymond
's
!
 
<EOS>
A
bill
upon
one
Murry
in
Chester
,
which
depends
entirely
not
only
upon
Raymond
's
honesty
,
but
his
discretion
;
and
in
money
matters
he
is
the
last
man
I
would
depend
on
.
 
<EOS>
Why
should
Sir
Alexander
Cairnes
in
London
pay
me
a
bill
,
drawn
by
God
<EOS>
knows
who
,
upon
Murry
in
Chester
?
 
<EOS>
I
was
at
Cairnes
's
,
and
they
can
do
no
such
thing
.
 
<EOS>
I
went
among
some
friends
,
who
are
merchants
,
and
I
find
the
bill
must
be
sent
to
Murry
,
accepted
by
him
,
and
then
returned
back
,
and
then
Cairnes
may
accept
or
refuse
it
as
he
pleases
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
I
gave
Sir
Thomas
Frankland
the
bill
,
who
has
sent
it
to
Chester
,
and
ordered
the
postmaster
there
to
get
it
accepted
,
and
then
send
it
back
,
and
in
a
day
or
two
I
shall
have
an
answer
;
and
therefore
this
letter
must
stay
a
day
or
two
longer
than
I
intended
,
and
see
what
answer
I
get
.
 
<EOS>
Raymond
should
have
written
to
Murry
at
the
same
time
,
to
desire
Sir
Alexander
Cairnes
to
have
answered
such
a
bill
,
if
it
come
.
 
<EOS>
But
Cairnes
's
clerks
(
himself
was
not
at
home
)
said
they
had
received
no
notice
of
it
,
and
could
do
nothing
;
and
advised
me
to
send
to
Murry
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
six
weeks
to
-
day
at
Chelsea
,
and
you
know
it
<EOS>
but
just
now
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
Dean
  
thinks
I
write
the
Medley
.
 
<EOS>
Pox
of
his
judgment
!
 
<EOS>
It
is
equal
to
his
honesty
.
 
<EOS>
Then
you
han't
seen
the
Miscellany
yet
?
 
<EOS>
Why
,
'
tis
a
four
-
shilling
book
:
 
<EOS>
has
nobody
carried
it
over
?
 
<EOS>
No
,
I
believe
Manley
will
not
lose
his
place
;
for
his
friend
in
England
is
so
far
from
being
out
that
he
has
taken
a
new
patent
since
the
Post
Office
Act
;
and
his
brother
Jack
Manley
here
takes
his
part
firmly
;
and
I
have
often
spoken
to
Southwell
in
his
behalf
,
and
he
seems
very
well
inclined
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
Irish
folks
here
in
general
are
horribly
violent
against
him
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
he
must
consider
he
could
not
send
Stella
wine
if
he
were
put
out
.
<EOS>
And
so
he
is
very
kind
,
and
sends
you
a
dozen
bottles
of
wine
AT
<EOS>
A
TIME
,
<EOS>
and
you
win
eight
shillings
<EOS>
AT
A
TIME
;
and
how
much
do
you
lose
?
 
<EOS>
No
,
no
,
never
one
syllable
about
that
,
I
warrant
you
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
this
same
Stella
is
so
unmerciful
a
writer
,
she
has
hardly
left
any
room
for
Dingley
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
have
such
summer
there
as
here
,
sure
the
Wexford
waters
are
good
by
this
time
.
 
<EOS>
I
forgot
what
weather
we
had
May
6th
;
go
look
in
my
journal
.
 
<EOS>
We
had
terrible
rain
the
24th
and
25th
,
and
never
a
drop
since
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
yes
,
I
remember
Berested
's
bridge
;
the
coach
sosses
up
and
down
as
one
goes
that
way
,
just
as
at
Hockley
-
in
-
the
-
Hole
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
impute
any
illness
or
health
<EOS>
I
have
to
good
or
ill
weather
,
but
to
want
of
exercise
,
or
ill
air
,
or
something
I
have
eaten
,
or
hard
study
,
or
sitting
up
;
and
so
I
fence
against
those
as
well
as
I
can
:
 
but
who
a
deuce
can
help
the
weather
?
 
<EOS>
Will
Seymour
,
the
General
,
was
excessively
hot
with
the
sun
shining
full
upon
him
;
so
he
turns
to
the
sun
,
and
says
,
"
Harkee
,
friend
,
you
had
better
go
and
ripen
cucumbers
than
plague
me
at
this
rate
,
"
etc
.
 
<EOS>
Another
time
,
fretting
at
the
heat
,
a
gentleman
by
said
it
was
such
weather
as
pleased
God
:
 
<EOS>
Seymour
said
,
"
Perhaps
it
may
;
but
I
am
sure
it
pleases
nobody
else
.
"
 
<EOS>
Why
,
Madam
Dingley
,
the
First
-
Fruits
are
done
.
 
<EOS>
Southwell
told
me
they
went
to
inquire
about
them
,
and
Lord
Treasurer
said
they
were
done
,
and
had
been
done
long
ago
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
'll
tell
you
a
secret
you
must
not
mention
,
that
the
Duke
of
Ormond
is
ordered
to
take
notice
of
them
in
his
speech
in
your
Parliament
:
 
<EOS>
and
I
desire
you
will
take
care
to
say
on
occasion
that
my
Lord
Treasurer
Harley
did
it
many
months
ago
,
before
the
Duke
was
Lord
Lieutenant
.
 
<EOS>
And
yet
I
can
not
possibly
come
over
yet
:
<EOS>
so
get
you
gone
to
Wexford
,
and
make
Stella
well
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
yes
,
I
take
care
not
to
walk
late
;
I
never
did
but
once
,
and
there
are
five
hundred
people
on
the
way
as
I
walk
.
<EOS>
Tisdall
is
a
puppy
,
and
I
will
excuse
him
the
half
-
hour
he
would
talk
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
As
for
the
Examiner
,
I
have
heard
a
whisper
that
after
that
of
this
day
,
which
tells
us
what
this
Parliament
has
done
,
you
will
hardly
find
them
so
good
.
 
<EOS>
I
prophesy
they
will
be
trash
for
the
future
;
and
methinks
in
this
day
's
Examiner
the
author
talks
doubtfully
,
as
if
he
would
write
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
Observe
whether
the
change
be
discovered
in
Dublin
,
only
for
your
own
curiosity
,
that
's
all
.
 
<EOS>
Make
a
mouth
there
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Vedeau
's
business
<EOS>
I
have
answered
,
and
I
hope
the
bill
is
not
lost
.
 
<EOS>
Morrow
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
stewing
hot
,
<EOS>
but
I
must
rise
and
go
to
town
between
fire
and
water
.
 
<EOS>
Morrow
,
sirrahs
both
,
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
At
night
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
to
-
day
with
Colonel
Crowe
,
Governor
of
Jamaica
,
and
your
friend
Sterne
.
 
<EOS>
I
presented
Sterne
to
my
Lord
Treasurer
's
brother
,
and
gave
him
his
case
,
and
engaged
him
in
his
favour
.
 
<EOS>
At
dinner
there
fell
the
swingingest
long
shower
,
and
the
most
grateful
to
me
,
that
ever
I
saw
:
 
it
thundered
fifty
times
at
least
,
and
the
air
is
so
cool
that
a
body
is
able
to
live
;
and
I
walked
home
to
-
night
with
comfort
,
and
without
dirt
.
 
<EOS>
I
went
this
evening
to
Lord
Treasurer
,
and
sat
with
him
two
hours
,
and
we
were
in
very
good
humour
,
and
he
abused
me
,
and
called
me
Dr.
Thomas
Swift
fifty
times
:
 
<EOS>
I
have
told
you
he
does
that
when
he
has
mind
to
make
me
mad
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
Thomas
Frankland
gave
me
to
-
day
a
letter
from
Murry
,
accepting
my
bill
;
so
all
is
well
:
 
only
,
by
a
letter
from
Parvisol
<EOS>
,
I
find
there
are
some
perplexities
.
 
<EOS>
Joe
has
likewise
written
to
me
,
to
thank
me
for
what
I
have
done
for
him
;
and
desires
I
would
write
to
the
Bishop
of
Clogher
,
that
Tom
Ashe
may
not
hinder
his
father
from
being
portreve
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
written
and
sent
to
Joe
several
times
,
that
I
will
not
trouble
myself
at
all
about
Trim
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
them
their
liberty
,
but
they
do
not
deserve
it
:
 
so
tell
Joe
,
and
send
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
mighty
happy
with
this
rain
:
 
<EOS>
I
was
at
the
end
of
my
patience
,
but
now
I
live
again
.
 
<EOS>
This
can
not
go
till
Saturday
;
and
perhaps
I
may
go
out
of
town
with
Lord
Shelburne
and
Lady
Kerry
to
-
morrow
for
two
or
three
days
.
 
<EOS>
Lady
Kerry
has
written
to
desire
it
;
but
tomorrow
I
shall
know
farther
.
 
<EOS>
O
<EOS>
this
dear
rain
,
I
can
not
forbear
praising
it
:
 
<EOS>
I
never
felt
myself
to
be
revived
so
in
my
life
.
 
<EOS>
It
lasted
from
three
till
five
,
hard
as
a
horn
,
and
mixed
with
hail
.
  
<EOS>

.
 
<EOS>
Morning
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
going
to
town
,
and
will
just
finish
this
there
,
if
I
go
into
the
country
with
Lady
Kerry
and
Lord
Shelburne
:
 
<EOS>
so
morrow
,
till
an
hour
or
two
hence
.
 
<EOS>
In
town
.
 
<EOS>
I
met
Cairnes
,
who
,
I
suppose
,
will
pay
me
the
money
;
though
he
says
I
must
send
him
the
bill
first
,
and
I
will
get
it
done
in
absence
.

Farewell

<EOS>
I
have
been
all
this
time
at
Wycombe
,
between
Oxford
and
London
,
with
Lord
Shelburne
,
who
has
the
squire
's
house
at
the
town
's
end
,
and
an
estate
there
in
a
delicious
country
.
 
<EOS>
Lady
Kerry
and
Mrs.
Pratt
were
with
us
,
and
we
passed
our
time
well
enough
;
and
there
I
wholly
disengaged
myself
from
all
public
thoughts
,
and
everything
but
MD
,
who
had
the
impudence
to
send
me
a
letter
there
;
but
I
'll
be
revenged
:
 
I
will
answer
it
.
 
<EOS>
This
day
,
the
20th
,
I
came
from
Wycombe
with
Lady
Kerry
after
dinner
,
lighted
at
Hyde
Park
Corner
,
and
walked
:
 
<EOS>
it
was
twenty
-
seven
miles
,
and
we
came
it
in
about
five
hours
.
  
<EOS>
21
.
 
<EOS>
I
went
at
noon
to
see
Mr.
Secretary
at
his
office
,
and
there
was
Lord
Treasurer
:
 
<EOS>
so
I
killed
two
birds
,
etc
.
,
and
we
were
glad
to
see
one
another
,
and
so
forth
.
 
<EOS>
And
the
Secretary
and
I
dined
at
Sir
William
Wyndham
's
,
who
married
Lady
Catharine
Seymour
,
your
acquaintance
,
I
suppose
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
ten
of
us
at
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
It
seems
,
in
my
absence
,
they
had
erected
a
Club
,
and
made
me
one
;
and
we
made
some
laws
to
-
day
,
which
I
am
to
digest
and
add
to
,
against
next
meeting
.
 
<EOS>
Our
meetings
are
to
be
every
Thursday
.
 
<EOS>
We
are
yet
but
twelve
:
 
<EOS>
Lord
Keeper
and
Lord
Treasurer
were
proposed
;
but
I
was
against
them
,
and
so
was
Mr.
Secretary
,
though
their
sons
are
of
it
,
and
so
they
are
excluded
;
but
we
design
to
admit
the
Duke
of
Shrewsbury
.
 
<EOS>
The
end
of
our
Club
is
,
to
advance
conversation
and
friendship
,
and
to
reward
deserving
persons
with
our
interest
and
recommendation
.
 
<EOS>
We
take
in
none
but
men
of
wit
or
men
of
interest
;
and
if
we
go
on
as
we
begin
,
no
other
Club
in
this
town
will
be
worth
talking
of
.
 
<EOS>
The
Solicitor
-
General
,
Sir
Robert
Raymond
,
is
one
of
our
Club
;
and
I
ordered
him
immediately
to
write
to
your
Lord
Chancellor
in
favour
of
Dr.
Raymond
:
 
<EOS>
so
tell
Raymond
,
if
you
see
him
;
but
I
believe
this
will
find
you
at
Wexford
.
 
<EOS>
This
letter
will
come
three
weeks
after
the
last
,
so
there
is
a
week
lost
;
but
that
is
owing
to
my
being
out
of
town
;
yet
I
think
it
is
right
,
because
it
goes
enclosed
to
Mr.
Reading
:
 
<EOS>
and
why
should
he
know
how
often
Presto
writes
to
MD
,
pray
?
 
<EOS>
I
sat
this
evening
with
Lady
Betty
Butler
and
Lady
Ashburnham
,
and
then
came
home
by
eleven
,
and
had
a
good
cool
walk
;
for
we
have
had
no
extreme
hot
weather
this
fortnight
,
but
a
great
deal
of
rain
at
times
,
and
a
body
can
live
and
breathe
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
it
will
hold
so
.
 
<EOS>
We
had
peaches
to
-
day
.
  
<EOS>
22
.
 
<EOS>
I
went
late
to
-
day
to
town
,
and
dined
with
my
friend
Lewis
.
 
<EOS>
I
saw
Will
Congreve
attending
at
the
Treasury
,
by
order
,
with
his
brethren
,
the
Commissioners
of
the
Wine
Licences
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
often
mentioned
him
with
kindness
to
Lord
Treasurer
;
and
Congreve
told
me
that
,
after
they
had
answered
to
what
they
were
sent
for
,
my
lord
called
him
privately
,
and
spoke
to
him
with
great
kindness
,
promising
his
protection
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
The
poor
man
said
he
had
been
used
so
ill
of
late
years
that
he
was
quite
astonished
at
my
lord
's
goodness
,
etc
.
,
and
desired
me
to
tell
my
lord
so
;
which
I
did
this
evening
,
and
recommended
him
heartily
.
 
<EOS>
My
lord
assured
me
he
esteemed
him
very
much
,
and
would
be
always
kind
to
him
;
<EOS>
that
what
he
said
was
to
make
Congreve
easy
,
because
he
knew
people
talked
as
if
his
lordship
designed
to
turn
everybody
out
,
and
particularly
Congreve
:
 
which
indeed
was
true
,
for
the
poor
man
told
me
he
apprehended
it
.
 
<EOS>
As
I
left
my
Lord
Treasurer
,
I
called
on
Congreve
(
knowing
where
he
dined
)
,
and
told
him
what
had
passed
between
my
lord
and
me
;
so
I
have
made
a
worthy
man
easy
,
and
that
is
a
good
day
's
work
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
proposing
to
my
lord
to
erect
a
society
or
academy
for
correcting
and
settling
our
language
,
that
we
may
not
perpetually
be
changing
as
we
do
.
 
<EOS>
He
enters
mightily
into
it
,
so
does
the
Dean
of
Carlisle
;
and
I
design
to
write
a
letter
to
Lord
Treasurer
with
the
proposals
of
it
,
and
publish
it
;
and
so
I
told
my
lord
,
and
he
approves
it
.
 
<EOS>
Yesterday
's
was
a
sad
Examiner
,
and
last
week
was
very
indifferent
,
though
some
little
scraps
of
the
old
spirit
,
as
if
he
had
given
some
hints
;
but
yesterday
's
is
all
trash
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
plain
the
hand
is
changed
.
  
<EOS>

<EOS>
I
have
not
been
in
London
to
-
day
:
 
for
Dr.
Gastrell
<EOS>
and
I
dined
,
by
invitation
,
with
the
Dean
of
Carlisle
,
my
neighbour
;
<EOS>
so
I
know
not
what
they
are
doing
in
the
world
,
a
mere
country
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
And
are
not
you
ashamed
both
to
go
into
the
country
just
when
I
did
,
and
stay
ten
days
,
just
as
I
did
,
saucy
monkeys
?
 
<EOS>
But
I
never
rode
;
I
had
no
horses
,
and
our
coach
was
out
of
order
,
and
we
went
and
came
in
a
hired
one
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
keep
your
lodgings
when
you
go
to
Wexford
?
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
you
do
;
for
you
will
hardly
stay
above
two
months
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
walking
about
our
town
to
-
night
,
and
it
is
a
very
scurvy
place
for
walking
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
thinking
to
leave
it
,
and
return
to
town
,
now
the
Irish
folks
are
gone
.
 
<EOS>
Ford
goes
in
three
days
.
 
<EOS>
How
does
Dingley
divert
herself
while
Stella
is
riding
?
<EOS>
work
,
or
read
,
or
walk
?
 
<EOS>
Does
Dingley
ever
read
to
you
?
 
<EOS>
Had
you
ever
a
book
with
you
in
the
country
?
 
<EOS>
Is
all
that
left
off
?
 
<EOS>
Confess
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
I
'll
go
sleep
;
'
tis
past
eleven
,
and
I
go
early
to
sleep
:
 
<EOS>
I
write
nothing
at
night
but
to
MD
.

Stratford
and
I
,
and
Pastoral
Philips
(
just
come
from
Denmark
)
dined
at
Ford

who
paid
his

goes

The
Earl
of
Peterborow
is
returned
from
Vienna
without
one
servant
:
 
he
left
them
scattered
in
several
towns
of
Germany
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
a
letter
from
him
,
four
days
ago
,
from
Hanover
,
where
he
desires
I
would
immediately
send
him
an
answer
to
his
house
at
Parson
's
Green
,
about
five
miles
off
.
 
<EOS>
I
wondered
what
he
meant
,
till
I
heard
he
was
come
.
 
<EOS>
He
sent
expresses
,
and
got
here
before
them
.
<EOS>
He
is
above
fifty
,
and
as
active
as
one
of
five
-
and
-
twenty
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
seen
him
yet
,
nor
know
when
I
shall
,
or
where
to
find
him
.

Poor
Duke
of
Shrewsbury
has
been
very
ill
of
a
fever
:
 
<EOS>
we
were
all
in
a
fright
about
him
:
 
<EOS>
I
thank
God
,
he
is
better
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
to
-
day
at
Lord
Ashburnham
's
,
with
his
lady
,
for
he
was
not
at
home
:
 
<EOS>
she
is
a
very
good
girl
,
and
always
a
great
favourite
of
mine
.
 
<EOS>
Sterne
tells
me
he
has
desired
a
friend
to
receive
your
box
in
Chester
,
and
carry
it
over
.
 
<EOS>
I
fear
he
will
miscarry
in
his
business
,
which
was
sent
to
the
Treasury
before
he
was
recommended
;
for
I
was
positive
only
to
second
his
recommendations
,
and
all
his
other
friends
failed
him
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
on
your
account
I
will
do
what
I
can
<EOS>
for
him
to
-
morrow
with
the
secretary
of
the
Treasury
.
  
<EOS>
26
.
 
<EOS>
We
had
much
company
to
-
day
at
dinner
at
Lord
Treasurer
's
.
 
<EOS>
Prior
never
fails
:
 
<EOS>
he
is
a
much
better
courtier
than
I
;
and
we
expect
every
day
that
he
will
be
a
Commissioner
of
the
Customs
,
and
that
in
a
short
time
a
great
many
more
will
be
turned
out
.
 
<EOS>
They
blame
Lord
Treasurer
for
his
slowness
in
turning
people
out
;
but
I
suppose
he
has
his
reasons
.
 
<EOS>
They
still
keep
my
neighbour
Atterbury
in
suspense
about
the
deanery
of
Christ
Church
,
which
has
been
above
six
months
vacant
,
and
he
is
heartily
angry
.
 
<EOS>
I
reckon
you
are
now
preparing
for
your
Wexford
expedition
;
and
poor
Dingley
is
full
of
carking
and
caring
,
scolding
.
 
<EOS>
How
long
will
you
stay
?
 
<EOS>
Shall
I
be
in
Dublin
before
you
return
?
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
fall
and
hurt
yourselves
,
nor
overturn
the
coach
.
 
<EOS>
Love
one
another
,
and
be
good
girls
;
and
drink
Presto
's
health
in
water
,
Madam
Stella
;
and
in
good
ale
,
Madam
Dingley
.
  
<EOS>

<EOS>
The
Secretary
appointed
me
to
dine
with
him
to
-
day
,
and
we
were
to
do
a
world
of
business
:
 
<EOS>
he
came
at
four
,
and
brought
Prior
with
him
,
and
had
forgot
the
appointment
,
and
no
business
was
done
.
 
<EOS>
I
left
him
at
eight
,
and
went
to
change
my
gown
at
Mrs.
Vanhomrigh
's
;
and
there
was
Sir
Andrew
Fountaine
at
ombre
with
Lady
Ashburnham
and
Lady
Frederic
Schomberg
,
and
Lady
Mary
Schomberg
,
and
Lady
Betty
Butler
,
and
others
,
talking
;
and
it
put
me
in
mind
of
the
Dean
and
Stoyte
,
and
Walls
,
and
Stella
at
play
,
and
Dingley
and
I
looking
on
.
 
<EOS>
I
stayed
with
them
till
ten
,
like
a
fool
.
 
<EOS>
Lady
Ashburnham
is
something
like
Stella
;
so
I
helped
her
,
and
wished
her
good
cards
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
late
,
etc
.
  
<EOS>
28
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
but
I
must
answer
this
letter
of
our
MD
's
.
 
<EOS>
Saturday
approaches
,
and
I
han't
written
down
this
side
.
 
<EOS>
O
,
faith
<EOS>
,
Presto
has
been
a
sort
of
a
lazy
fellow
:
 
but
Presto
will
remove
to
town
this
day
<EOS>
se'ennight
;
the
Secretary
has
commanded
me
to
do
so
;
and
I
believe
he
and
I
shall
go
for
some
days
to
Windsor
,
where
he
will
have
leisure
to
mind
some
business
we
have
together
.
 
<EOS>
To
-
day
,
our
Society
(
it
must
not
be
called
a
Club
)
dined
at
Mr.
Secretary
's
:
 
<EOS>
we
were
but
eight
;
the
rest
sent
excuses
,
or
were
out
of
town
.
<EOS>
We
sat
till
eight
,
and
made
some
laws
and
settlements
;
and
then
I
went
to
take
leave
of
Lady
Ashburnham
,
who
goes
out
of
town
to
-
morrow
,
as
a
great
many
of
my
acquaintance
are
already
,
and
left
the
town
very
thin
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
make
but
<EOS>
short
journeys
this
summer
,
and
not
be
long
out
of
London
.
 
<EOS>
The
days
are
grown
sensibly
short
already
,
all
our
fruit
blasted
.
 
<EOS>
Your
Duke
of
Ormond
is
still
at
Chester
;
and
perhaps
this
letter
will
be
with
you
as
soon
as
he
.
 
<EOS>
Sterne
's
business
is
quite
blown
up
:
 
<EOS>
they
stand
to
it
to
send
him
back
to
the
Commissioners
of
the
Revenue
in
Ireland
for
a
reference
,
and
all
my
credit
could
not
alter
it
,
though
I
almost
fell
out
with
the
secretary
of
the
Treasury
,
who
is
my
Lord
Treasurer
's
cousin
-
germain
,
and
<EOS>
my
very
good
friend
.
 
<EOS>
It
seems
every
step
he
has
hitherto
taken
hath
been
wrong
;
at
least
they
say
so
,
and
that
is
the
same
thing
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
heartily
sorry
for
it
;
and
I
really
think
they
are
in
the
wrong
,
and
use
him
hardly
;
but
I
can
do
no
more
.
  
<EOS>
29
.
 
<EOS>
Steele
has
had
the
assurance
to
write
to
me
that
I
would
engage
my
Lord
Treasurer
to
keep
a
friend
of
his
in
an
employment
:
 
<EOS>
I
believe
I
told
you
how
he
and
Addison
served
me
for
my
good
offices
in
Steele
's
behalf
;
and
I
promised
Lord
Treasurer
never
to
speak
for
either
of
them
again
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
Andrew
Fountaine
and
I
dined
to
-
day
at
Mrs.
Vanhomrigh
's
.
 
<EOS>
Dilly
Ashe
has
been
in
town
this
fortnight
:
 
<EOS>
I
saw
him
twice
;
he
was
four
days
at
Lord
Pembroke
's
in
the
country
,
punning
with
him
;
his
face
is
very
well
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
this
evening
two
or
three
hours
at
Lord
Treasurer
's
,
who
called
me
Dr.
Thomas
Swift
twenty
times
;
that
's
his
way
of
teasing
.
 
<EOS>
I
left
him
at
nine
,
and
got
home
here
by
ten
,
like
a
gentleman
;
and
to
-
morrow
morning
<EOS>
I
'll
answer
your
little
letter
,
sirrahs
.
  
<EOS>
30
.
 
<EOS>
Morning
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
terribly
sleepy
always
in
a
morning
;
I
believe
it
is
my
walk
over
-
night
that
disposes
me
to
sleep
:
 
faith
,
'
tis
now
striking
eight
,
and
I
am
but
just
awake
.
 
<EOS>
Patrick
comes
early
,
and
wakes
me
five
or
six
times
;
but
I
have
excuses
,
though
I
am
three
parts
asleep
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
him
I
sat
up
late
,
or
slept
ill
in
the
night
,
and
often
it
is
a
lie
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
now
got
little
MD
's
letter
before
me
,
N.16
,
no
more
,
nor
no
less
<EOS>
,
no
mistake
.
 
<EOS>
Dingley
says
,
"
This
letter
wo
n't
be
above
six
lines
"
;
and
I
was
afraid
it
was
true
,
though
I
saw
it
filled
on
both
sides
.
 
<EOS>
The
Bishop
of
Clogher
writ
<EOS>
me
word
you
were
in
the
country
,
and
that
he
heard
you
were
well
<EOS>
:
 
<EOS>
I
am
glad
at
heart
MD
rides
,
and
rides
,
and
rides
.
 
<EOS>
Our
hot
weather
ended
in
May
,
and
all
this
month
has
been
moderate
:
 
<EOS>
it
was
then
so
hot
<EOS>
I
was
not
able
to
endure
it
;
I
was
miserable
every
moment
,
and
found
myself
disposed
to
be
peevish
and
quarrelsome
:
 
<EOS>
I
believe
a
very
hot
country
would
make
me
stark
mad
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
my
head
continues
pretty
tolerable
,
and
I
impute
it
all
to
walking
.
 
<EOS>
Does
Stella
eat
fruit
?
 
<EOS>
I
eat
a
little
;
but
I
always
repent
,
and
resolve
against
it
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
in
very
hot
weather
I
always
go
to
town
by
water
;
but
I
constantly
walk
back
,
for
then
the
sun
is
down
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
Mrs.
Proby
goes
with
you
to
Wexford
:
 
<EOS>
she
's
admirable
company
;
you
'll
grow
plaguy
wise
with
those
you
frequent
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Taylor
and
Mrs.
Proby
!
<EOS>
take
care
of
infection
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
my
two
hundred
pounds
will
be
paid
,
but
that
Sir
Alexander
Cairnes
is
a
scrupulous
puppy
:
 
<EOS>
I
left
the
bill
with
Mr.
Stratford
,
who
is
to
have
the
money
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
Madam
Stella
,
what
say
you
?
<EOS>
you
ride
every
day
;
I
know
that
already
,
sirrah
;
and
,
if
you
rid
every
day
for
a
twelvemonth
,
you
would
be
still
better
and
better
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
I
hope
Parvisol
will
not
have
the
impudence
to
make
you
stay
an
hour
for
the
money
;
if
he
does
,
I
'll
UN
-
PARVISOL
him
;
pray
let
me
know
.
 
<EOS>
O
Lord
,
how
hasty
we
are
!
<EOS>
Stella
ca
n't
stay
writing
and
writing
;
she
must
write
and
go
a
cock
-
horse
,
pray
now
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
but
the
horses
are
not
come
to
the
door
;
the
fellow
ca
n't
find
the
bridle
;
your
stirrup
is
broken
;
where
did
you
put
the
whips
,
Dingley
?
<EOS>
Marget
,
where
have
you
laid
Mrs.
Johnson
's
ribbon
to
tie
about
her
?
<EOS>
reach
me
my
mask
:
 
<EOS>
sup
up
this
before
you
go
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
so
,
a
gallop
,
a
gallop
:
 
sit
fast
,
sirrah
,
and
do
n't
ride
hard
upon
the
stones
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
now
Stella
is
gone
,
tell
me
,
Dingley
,
is
she
a
good
girl
?
<EOS>
and
what
news
is
that
you
are
to
tell
me
?
  
<EOS>
No
,
I
believe
the
box
is
not
lost
:
 
<EOS>
Sterne
says
it
is
not
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
faith
,
you
must
go
to
Wexford
without
seeing
your
Duke
of
Ormond
,
unless
you
stay
on
purpose
;
perhaps
you
may
be
so
wise
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
you
this
is
your
sixteenth
letter
;
will
you
never
be
satisfied
?
 
<EOS>
No
,
no
,
I
will
walk
late
no
more
;
I
ought
less
to
venture
it
than
other
people
,
and
so
I
was
told
:
 
<EOS>
but
I
will
return
to
lodge
in
town
next
Thursday
.
 
<EOS>
When
you
come
from
Wexford
,
I
would
have
you
send
a
letter
of
attorney
to
Mr.
Benjamin
Tooke
,
bookseller
,
in
London
,
directed
to
me
;
and
he
shall
manage
your
affair
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
your
parchment
safely
locked
up
in
London
.
 
<EOS>
O
,
Madam
Stella
,
welcome
home
;
was
it
pleasant
riding
?
<EOS>
did
your
horse
stumble
?
<EOS>
how
often
did
the
man
light
to
settle
your
stirrup
?
<EOS>
ride
nine
miles
!
<EOS>
faith
,
you
have
galloped
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
but
where
is
the
fine
thing
you
promised
me
?
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
a
good
boy
,
ask
Dingley
else
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
you
did
not
meet
the
fine
-
thing
-
man
:
 
<EOS>
faith
,
you
are
a
cheat
.
<EOS>
So
you
will
see
Raymond
and
his
wife
in
town
.
 
<EOS>
Faith
,
that
riding
to
Laracor
gives
me
short
sighs
,
as
well
as
you
.
 
<EOS>
All
the
days
I
have
passed
here
have
been
dirt
to
those
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
gaining
enemies
by
the
scores
,
and
friends
by
the
couples
;
which
is
against
the
rules
of
wisdom
,
because
they
say
one
enemy
can
do
more
hurt
than
ten
friends
can
do
good
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
have
had
my
revenge
at
least
,
if
I
get
nothing
else
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
let
Fate
govern
.
 
<EOS>
Now
I
think
your
letter
is
answered
;
and
mine
will
be
shorter
than
ordinary
,
because
it
must
go
to
-
day
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
had
a
great
deal
of
scattering
rain
for
some
days
past
,
yet
it
hardly
keeps
down
the
dust
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
plays
acted
in
our
town
;
and
Patrick
was
at
one
of
them
,
<EOS>
oh
oh
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
damnably
mauled
one
day
when
he
was
drunk
;
he
was
at
cuffs
with
a
brother
-
footman
,
who
dragged
him
along
the
floor
upon
his
face
,
which
looked
for
a
week
after
as
if
he
had
the
leprosy
;
and
I
was
glad
enough
to
see
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
ten
times
sending
him
over
to
you
;
yet
now
he
has
new
clothes
,
and
a
laced
hat
,
which
the
hatter
brought
by
his
orders
,
and
he
offered
to
pay
for
the
lace
out
of
his
wages
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
to
dine
to
-
day
with
Dilly
at
Sir
Andrew
Fountaine
's
,
who
has
bought
a
new
house
,
and
will
be
weary
of
it
in
half
a
year
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
rise
and
shave
,
and
walk
to
town
,
unless
I
go
with
the
Dean
in
his
chariot
at
twelve
,
which
is
too
late
:
 
<EOS>
and
I
have
not
seen
that
Lord
Peterborow
yet
.
 
<EOS>
The
Duke
of
Shrewsbury
is
almost
well
again
,
and
will
be
abroad
in
a
day
or
two
:
 
<EOS>
what
care
you
?
 
<EOS>
There
it
is
now
:
 
you
do
not
care
for
my
friends
.
 
<EOS>
Farewell
,
my
dearest
lives
and
delights
<EOS>
;
I
love
you
better
than
ever
,
if
possible
,
as
hope
saved
,
I
do
,
and
ever
will
.
 
<EOS>
God
Almighty
bless
you
ever
,
and
make
us
happy
together
!
 
<EOS>
I
pray
for
this
twice
every
day
;
and
I
hope
God
will
hear
my
poor
hearty
prayers
.
 
<EOS>
Remember
,
if
I
am
used
ill
and
ungratefully
,
as
I
have
formerly
been
,
'
tis
what
I
am
prepared
for
,
and
shall
not
wonder
at
it
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
I
am
now
envied
,
and
thought
in
high
favour
,
and
have
every
day
numbers
of
considerable
men
teasing
me
to
solicit
for
them
.
 
<EOS>
And
the
Ministry
all
use
me
perfectly
well
;
and
<EOS>
all
that
know
them
say
they
love
me
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
I
can
count
upon
nothing
,
nor
will
,
but
upon
MD
's
love
and
kindness
.
 
<EOS>
They
think
me
useful
;
they
pretended
they
were
afraid
of
none
but
me
,
and
that
they
resolved
to
have
me
;
they
have
often
confessed
this
:
yet
all
makes
little
impression
on
me
.
 
<EOS>
Pox
of
these
speculations
!
<EOS>
they
give
me
the
spleen
;
and
that
is
a
disease
I
was
not
born
to
.
 
<EOS>
Let
me
alone
,
sirrahs
,
and
be
satisfied
:
 
<EOS>
I
am
,
as
long
as
MD
and
Presto
are
well
.
       
<EOS>
Little
wealth
,
     
And
much
health
,
     
And
a
life
by
stealth
:
  
<EOS>
that
is
all
we
want
;
and
so
farewell
,
dearest
MD
;
Stella
,
Dingley
,
Presto
,
all
together
,

Farewell

and

LETTER
26
.
 
<EOS>
CHELSEA
,
June
30
,
1711
.
  
<EOS>
See
what
large
paper
I
am
forced
to
take
,
to
write
to
MD
;
Patrick
has
brought
me
none
clipped
;
but
,
faith
,
the
next
shall
be
smaller
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
to
-
day
,
as
I
told
you
,
with
Dilly
at
Sir
Andrew
Fountaine
's
:
 
there
were
we
wretchedly
punning
,
and
writing
together
to
Lord
Pembroke
.
 
<EOS>
Dilly
is
just
such
a
puppy
as
ever
;
and
it
is
so
uncouth
,
after
so
long
an
intermission
.
 
<EOS>
My
twenty
-
fifth
is
gone
this
evening
to
the
post
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
will
direct
my
next
(
which
is
this
)
to
Mr.
Curry
's
,
and
let
them
send
it
to
Wexford
;
and
then
the
next
enclosed
to
Reading
.
 
<EOS>
Instruct
me
how
I
shall
do
.
 
<EOS>
I
long
to
hear
from
you
from
Wexford
,
and
what
sort
of
place
it
is
.
 
<EOS>
The
town
grows
very
empty
and
dull
.
 
<EOS>
This
evening
I
have
had
a
letter
from
Mr.
Philips
,
the
pastoral
poet
,
to
get
him
a
certain
employment
from
Lord
Treasurer
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
now
had
almost
all
the
Whig
poets
my
solicitors
;
and
I
have
been
useful
to
Congreve
,
Steele
,
and
Harrison
:
<EOS>
but
I
will
do
nothing
for
Philips
<EOS>
;
I
find
he
is
more
a
puppy
than
ever
,
so
do
n't
solicit
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
Besides
,
I
will
not
trouble
Lord
Treasurer
,
unless
upon
some
very
extraordinary
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
July
1
.
 
<EOS>
Dilly
lies
conveniently
for
me
when
I
come
to
town
from
Chelsea
of
a
Sunday
,
and
go
to
the
Secretary
's
;
so
I
called
at
his
lodgings
this
morning
,
and
sent
for
my
gown
,
and
dressed
myself
there
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
a
letter
from
the
Bishop
,
with
an
account
that
you
were
set
out
for
Wexford
the
morning
he
writ
,
which
was
June
26
,
and
he
had
the
letter
the
30th
;
that
was
very
quick
:
 
<EOS>
the
Bishop
says
you
design
to
stay
there
two
months
or
more
.
 
<EOS>
Dilly
had
also
a
letter
from
Tom
Ashe
,
full
of
Irish
news
;
that
your
Lady
Lyndon
is
dead
,
and
I
know
not
what
besides
of
Dr.
Coghill
losing
his
drab
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
The
Secretary
was
gone
to
Windsor
,
and
I
dined
with
Mrs.
Vanhomrigh
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Treasurer
is
at
Windsor
too
;
they
will
be
going
and
coming
all
summer
,
while
the
Queen
is
there
,
and
the
town
is
empty
,
and
I
fear
I
shall
be
sometimes
forced
to
stoop
beneath
my
dignity
,
and
send
to
the
ale
-
house
for
a
dinner
.
<EOS>
Well
,
sirrahs
,
had
you
a
good
journey
to
Wexford
?
<EOS>
did
you
drink
ale
by
the
way
?
<EOS>
were
you
never
overturned
?
<EOS>
how
many
things
did
you
forget
?
<EOS>
do
you
lie
on
straw
in
your
new
town
where
you
are
?
 
<EOS>
Cudshoe
,
the
next
letter
to
Presto
will
be
dated
from
Wexford
.
 
<EOS>
What
fine
company
have
you
there
?
<EOS>
what
new
acquaintance
have
you
got
?
 
<EOS>
You
are
to
write
constantly
to
Mrs.
Walls
and
Mrs.
Stoyte
:
 
and
the
Dean
said
,
"
Shall
we
never
hear
from
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Mr.
Dean
,
we
'll
make
bold
to
trouble
you
with
a
letter
.
"
 
<EOS>
Then
at
Wexford
;
when
you
meet
a
lady
,
"
Did
your
waters
pass
well
this
morning
,
madam
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Will
Dingley
drink
them
too
?
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
I
warrant
;
to
get
her
a
stomach
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
you
are
all
gamesters
at
Wexford
.
 
<EOS>
Do
not
lose
your
money
,
sirrah
,
far
from
home
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
I
shall
go
to
Windsor
in
a
few
days
;
at
least
,
the
Secretary
tells
me
so
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
a
small
house
there
,
with
just
room
enough
for
him
and
me
;
and
I
would
be
satisfied
to
pass
a
few
days
there
sometimes
.
 
<EOS>
Sirrahs
,
let
me
go
to
sleep
,
it
is
past
twelve
in
our
town
.
  
<EOS>

.
 
<EOS>
Sterne
came
to
me
this
morning
,
and
tells
me
he
has
yet
some
hopes
of
compassing
his
business
:
 
he
was
with
Tom
Harley
,
the
secretary
of
the
Treasury
,
and
made
him
doubt
a
little
he
was
in
the
wrong
;
the
poor
man
tells
me
it
will
almost
undo
him
if
he
fails
.
 
<EOS>
I
called
this
morning
to
see
Will
Congreve
,
who
lives
much
by
himself
,
is
forced
to
read
for
amusement
,
and
can
not
do
it
without
a
magnifying
-
glass
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
set
him
very
well
with
the
Ministry
,
and
I
hope
he
is
in
no
danger
of
losing
his
place
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
in
the
City
with
Dr.
Freind
,
not
among
my
merchants
,
but
with
a
scrub
instrument
of
mischief
of
mine
,
whom
I
never
mentioned
to
you
,
nor
am
like
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
You
two
little
saucy
Wexfordians
<EOS>
,
you
are
now
drinking
waters
.
 
<EOS>
You
drink
waters
!
<EOS>
you
go
fiddlestick
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
God
send
them
to
do
you
good
;
if
not
,
faith
,
next
summer
you
shall
come
to
the
Bath
.
  
<EOS>

.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Peterborow
desired
to
see
me
this
morning
at
nine
;
I
had
not
seen
him
before
since
he
came
home
.
 
<EOS>
I
met
Mrs.
Manley
there
,
who
was
soliciting
him
to
get
some
pension
or
reward
for
her
service
in
the
cause
,
by
writing
her
Atalantis
,
and
prosecution
,
etc
.
,
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
seconded
her
,
and
hope
they
will
do
something
for
the
poor
woman
.
 
<EOS>
My
lord
kept
me
two
hours
upon
politics
:
 
he
comes
home
very
sanguine
;
he
has
certainly
done
great
things
at
Savoy
and
Vienna
,
by
his
negotiations
:
 
he
is
violent
against
a
peace
,
and
finds
true
what
I
writ
to
him
,
that
the
Ministry
seems
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
reasons
well
;
yet
I
am
for
a
peace
.
 
<EOS>
I
took
leave
of
Lady
Kerry
,
who
goes
to
-
morrow
for
Ireland
;
she
picks
up
Lord
Shelburne
and
Mrs.
Pratt
at
Lord
Shelburne
's
house
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
this
evening
with
Lord
Treasurer
:
 
<EOS>
Tom
Harley
was
there
,
and
whispered
me
that
he
began
to
doubt
about
Sterne
's
business
;
I
told
him
he
would
find
he
was
in
the
wrong
.
 
<EOS>
I
sat
two
or
three
hours
at
Lord
Treasurer
's
;
he
rallied
me
sufficiently
upon
my
refusing
to
take
him
into
our
Club
,
and
told
a
judge
who
was
with
us
that
my
name
was
Thomas
Swift
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
a
mind
to
prevent
Sir
H.
Belasyse
going
to
Spain
,
who
is
a
most
covetous
cur
,
and
I
fell
a
railing
against
avarice
,
and
turned
it
so
that
he
smoked
me
,
and
named
Belasyse
.
 
<EOS>
I
went
on
,
and
said
it
was
a
shame
to
send
him
;
to
which
he
agreed
,
but
desired
I
would
name
some
who
understood
business
,
and
do
not
love
money
,
for
he
could
not
find
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
said
there
was
something
in
a
Treasurer
different
from
other
men
;
that
we
ought
not
to
make
a
man
a
Bishop
who
does
not
love
divinity
,
or
a
General
who
does
not
love
war
;
and
I
wondered
why
the
Queen
would
make
a
man
Lord
Treasurer
who
does
not
love
money
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
mightily
pleased
with
what
I
said
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
talking
of
the
First
-
Fruits
of
England
,
and
I
took
occasion
to
tell
him
that
I
would
not
for
a
thousand
pounds
anybody
<EOS>
but
he
had
got
them
for
Ireland
,
who
got
them
for
England
too
.
 
<EOS>
He
bid
me
consider
what
a
thousand
pounds
was
;
I
said
I
would
have
him
to
know
<EOS>
I
valued
a
thousand
pounds
as
little
as
he
valued
a
million
.
 
<EOS>
Is
it
not
silly
to
write
all
this
?
<EOS>
but
it
gives
you
an
idea
what
our
conversation
is
with
mixed
company
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
taken
a
lodging
in
Suffolk
Street
,
and
go
to
it
on
Thursday
;
and
design
to
walk
the
Park
and
the
town
,
to
supply
my
walking
here
:
 
yet
I
will
walk
here
sometimes
too
,
in
a
visit
now
and
then
to
the
Dean
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
was
almost
at
home
,
Patrick
told
me
he
had
two
letters
for
me
,
and
gave
them
to
me
in
the
dark
,
yet
I
could
see
one
of
them
was
from
saucy
MD
.
 
<EOS>
I
went
to
visit
the
Dean
for
half
an
hour
;
and
then
came
home
,
and
first
read
the
other
letter
,
which
was
from
the
Bishop
of
Clogher
,
who
tells
me
the
Archbishop
of
Dublin
mentioned
in
a
full
assembly
of
the
clergy
<EOS>
the
Queen
's
granting
the
First
-
Fruits
,
said
it
was
done
by
the
Lord
Treasurer
,
and
talked
much
of
my
merit
in
it
:
 
but
reading
yours
<EOS>
I
find
nothing
of
that
:
 
<EOS>
perhaps
the
Bishop
lies
,
out
of
a
desire
to
please
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
with
Mrs.
Vanhomrigh
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
sirrahs
,
you
are
gone
to
Wexford
;
but
I
'll
follow
you
.
  
<EOS>

.
 
<EOS>
Sterne
came
to
me
again
this
morning
,
to
advise
about
reasons
and
memorials
he
is
drawing
up
;
and
we
went
to
town
by
water
together
;
and
having
nothing
to
do
,
I
stole
into
the
City
to
an
instrument
of
mine
,
and
then
went
to
see
poor
Patty
Rolt
,
who
has
been
in
town
these
two
months
with
a
cousin
of
hers
.
 
<EOS>
Her
life
passes
with
boarding
in
some
country
town
as
cheap
as
she
can
,
and
,
when
she
runs
out
,
shifting
to
some
cheaper
place
,
or
coming
to
town
for
a
month
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
were
rich
,
I
would
ease
her
,
which
a
little
thing
would
do
.
<EOS>
Some
months
ago
I
sent
her
a
guinea
,
and
it
patched
up
twenty
circumstances
.
<EOS>
She
is
now
going
to
Berkhamstead
in
Hertfordshire
.
 
<EOS>
It
has
rained
and
hailed
prodigiously
to
-
day
,
with
some
thunder
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
the
last
night
I
lie
at
Chelsea
;
and
I
got
home
early
,
and
sat
two
hours
with
the
Dean
,
and
ate
victuals
,
having
had
a
very
scurvy
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
answer
your
letter
when
I
come
to
live
in
town
.
 
<EOS>
You
shall
have
a
fine
London
answer
:
 
<EOS>
but
first
I
will
go
sleep
,
and
dream
of
MD
.
  
<EOS>
London
,
July
5
.
 
<EOS>
This
day
I
left
Chelsea
for
good
(
that
's
a
genteel
phrase
)
,
and
am
got
into
Suffolk
Street
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
to
-
day
at
our
Society
,
and
we
are
adjourned
for
a
month
,
because
most
of
us
go
into
the
country
:
 
<EOS>
we
dined
at
Lord
Keeper
's
with
young
Harcourt
,
and
Lord
Keeper
was
forced
to
sneak
off
,
and
dine
with
Lord
Treasurer
,
who
had
invited
the
Secretary
and
me
to
dine
with
him
;
but
we
scorned
to
leave
our
company
,
as
George
Granville
did
,
whom
we
have
threatened
to
expel
:
 
however
<EOS>
,
in
the
evening
I
went
to
Lord
Treasurer
,
and
,
among
other
company
,
found
a
couple
of
judges
with
him
;
one
of
them
,
Judge
Powell
,
an
old
fellow
with
grey
hairs
,
was
the
merriest
old
gentleman
I
ever
saw
,
spoke
pleasant
things
,
and
laughed
and
chuckled
till
he
cried
again
.
 
<EOS>
I
stayed
till
eleven
,
because
I
was
not
now
to
walk
to
Chelsea
.
  
<EOS>

.
 
<EOS>
An
ugly
rainy
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
to
visit
Mrs.
Barton
,
then
called
at
Mrs.
Vanhomrigh
's
,
where
Sir
Andrew
Fountaine
and
the
rain
kept
me
to
dinner
;
and
there
did
<EOS>
I
loiter
all
the
afternoon
,
like
a
fool
,
out
of
perfect
laziness
,
and
the
weather
not
permitting
me
to
walk
:
 
<EOS>
but
I
'll
do
so
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
Are
your
waters
at
Wexford
good
in
this
rain
?
 
<EOS>
I
long
to
hear
how
you
are
established
there
,
how
and
whom
you
visit
,
what
is
your
lodging
,
what
are
your
entertainments
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
got
far
southwards
;
but
I
think
you
must
eat
no
fruit
while
you
drink
the
waters
.
 
<EOS>
I
ate
some
Kentish
cherries
t'other
day
,
and
I
repent
it
already
;
I
have
felt
my
head
a
little
disordered
.
 
<EOS>
We
had
not
a
hot
day
all
June
,
or
since
,
which
I
reckon
a
mighty
happiness
.
 
<EOS>
Have
you
left
a
direction
with
Reading
for
Wexford
?
 
<EOS>
I
will
,
as
I
said
,
direct
this
to
Curry
's
,
and
the
next
to
Reading
;
or
suppose
I
send
this
at
a
venture
straight
to
Wexford
?
 
<EOS>
It
would
vex
me
to
have
it
miscarry
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
a
letter
to
-
night
from
Parvisol
,
that
White
has
paid
me
most
of
my
remaining
money
;
and
another
from
Joe
,
that
they
have
had
their
election
at
Trim
,
but
not
a
word
of
who
is
chosen
portreeve
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
Joe
is
full
of
complaints
,
says
he
has
enemies
,
and
fears
he
will
never
get
his
two
hundred
pounds
;
and
I
fear
so
too
,
although
I
have
done
what
I
could
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
answer
your
letter
when
I
think
fit
,
when
saucy
Presto
thinks
fit
,
sirrahs
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
at
leisure
yet
;
when
I
have
nothing
to
do
,
perhaps
I
may
vouchsafe
.
 
<EOS>
O
Lord
,
the
two
Wexford
ladies
;
I
'll
go
dream
of
you
both
.
  
<EOS>

.
 
<EOS>
It
was
the
dismallest
rainy
day
I
ever
saw
:
 
<EOS>
I
went
to
the
Secretary
in
the
morning
,
and
he
was
gone
to
Windsor
.
 
<EOS>
Then
it
began
raining
,
and
I
struck
in
to
Mrs.
Vanhomrigh
's
,
and
dined
,
and
stayed
till
night
very
dull
and
insipid
.
 
<EOS>
I
hate
this
town
in
summer
;
I
'll
leave
it
for
a
while
,
if
I
can
have
time
.
  
<EOS>

.
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
fellow
of
your
town
,
one
Tisdall
,
<EOS>
lodges
in
the
same
house
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
Patrick
told
me
Squire
Tisdall
and
his
lady
lodged
here
.
 
<EOS>
I
pretended
<EOS>
I
never
heard
of
him
;
but
I
knew
his
ugly
face
,
and
saw
him
at
church
in
the
next
pew
to
me
,
and
he
often
looked
for
a
bow
,
but
it
would
not
do
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
he
lives
in
Capel
Street
,
and
has
an
ugly
fine
wife
in
a
fine
coach
.
 
<EOS>
Dr.
Freind
and
<EOS>
I
dined
in
the
City
by
invitation
,
and
I
drank
punch
,
very
good
,
but
it
makes
me
hot
.
 
<EOS>
People
here
are
troubled
with
agues
by
this
continuance
of
wet
,
cold
weather
;
but
I
am
glad
to
find
the
season
<EOS>
so
temperate
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
this
evening
to
see
Will
Congreve
,
who
is
a
very
agreeable
companion
.
  
<EOS>

.
 
<EOS>
I
was
to
-
day
in
the
City
,
and
dined
with
Mr.
Stratford
,
who
tells
me
Sir
Alexander
Cairnes
makes
difficulties
about
paying
my
bill
;
so
that
I
can
not
give
order
yet
to
Parvisol
to
deliver
up
the
bond
to
Dr.
Raymond
.
 
<EOS>
To
-
morrow
I
shall
have
a
positive
answer
:
 
that
Cairnes
is
a
shuffling
scoundrel
;
and
several
merchants
have
told
me
so
:
 
what
can
one
expect
from
a
Scot
and
a
fanatic
?
 
<EOS>
I
was
at
Bateman
's
the
bookseller
's
,
to
see
a
fine
old
library
he
has
bought
;
and
my
fingers
itched
,
as
yours
would
do
at
a
china
-
shop
;
but
I
resisted
,
and
found
everything
too
dear
,
and
I
have
fooled
away
too
much
money
that
way
already
.
 
<EOS>
So
go
and
drink
your
waters
,
saucy
rogue
,
and
make
yourself
well
;
and
pray
walk
while
you
are
there
:
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
notion
there
is
never
a
good
walk
in
Ireland
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
find
all
places
without
trees
?
 
<EOS>
Pray
observe
the
inhabitants
about
Wexford
;
they
are
old
English
;
see
what
they
have
particular
in
their
manners
,
names
,
and
language
:
 
magpies
have
been
always
there
,
and
nowhere
else
in
Ireland
,
till
of
late
years
.
 
<EOS>
They
say
the
cocks
and
dogs
go
to
sleep
at
noon
,
and
so
do
the
people
.
 
<EOS>
Write
your
travels
,
and
bring
home
good
eyes
and
health
.

<EOS>
I
dined
to
-
day
with
Lord
Treasurer
:
 
<EOS>
we
did
not
sit
down
till
four
.
 
<EOS>
I
despatched
three
businesses
with
him
,
and
forgot
a
fourth
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
have
got
a
friend
an
employment
;
and
besides
I
made
him
consent
to
let
me
bring
Congreve
to
dine
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
You
must
understand
I
have
a
mind
to
do
a
small
thing
,
only
turn
out
all
the
Queen
's
physicians
;
for
in
my
conscience
they
will
soon
kill
her
among
them
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
must
talk
over
that
matter
with
some
people
.
 
<EOS>
My
Lord
Treasurer
told
me
the
Queen
and
he
between
them
have
lost
the
paper
about
the
First
-
Fruits
,
but
desires
<EOS>
I
will
let
the
bishops
know
it
shall
be
done
with
the
first
opportunity
.
  
<EOS>

.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
to
-
day
with
neighbour
Van
,
and
walked
pretty
well
in
the
Park
this
evening
.
 
<EOS>
Stella
,
hussy
,
do
n't
you
remember
,
sirrah
,
you
used
to
reproach
me
about
meddling
in
other
folk
's
affairs
?
 
<EOS>
I
have
enough
of
it
now
:
 
two
people
came
to
me
to
-
night
in
the
Park
to
engage
to
speak
to
Lord
Treasurer
in
their
behalf
,
and
I
believe
they
make
up
fifty
who
have
asked
me
the
same
favour
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
hardened
,
and
resolve
to
trouble
him
,
or
any
other
Minister
,
less
than
ever
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
observe
those
who
have
ten
times
more
credit
than
I
will
not
speak
a
word
for
anybody
.
 
<EOS>
I
met
yesterday
the
poor
lad
I
told
you
of
,
who
lived
with
Mr.
Tenison
,
who
has
been
ill
of
an
ague
ever
since
I
saw
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
looked
wretchedly
,
and
was
exceeding
thankful
for
half
a
crown
I
gave
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
a
crown
from
me
before
.
  
<EOS>

.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
to
-
day
with
young
Manley
in
the
City
,
who
is
to
get
me
out
a
box
of
books
and
a
hamper
of
wine
from
Hamburg
.
 
<EOS>
I
inquired
of
Mr.
Stratford
,
who
tells
me
that
Cairnes
has
not
yet
paid
my
two
hundred
pounds
,
but
shams
and
delays
from
day
to
day
.
 
<EOS>
Young
Manley
's
wife
is
a
very
indifferent
person
of
a
young
woman
,
goggle
-
eyed
,
and
looks
like
a
fool
:
 
yet
he
is
a
handsome
fellow
,
and
married
her
for
love
after
long
courtship
,
and
she
refused
him
until
he
got
his
last
employment
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
I
shall
not
be
so
good
<EOS>
a
boy
for
writing
as
I
was
during
your
stay
at
Wexford
,
unless
I
may
send
my
letters
every
second
time
to
Curry
's
<EOS>
;
pray
let
me
know
.
 
<EOS>
This
,
I
think
,
shall
go
there
:
 
or
why
not
to
Wexford
itself
?
 
<EOS>
That
is
right
,
and
so
it
shall
this
next
Tuesday
,
although
it
costs
you
tenpence
.
 
<EOS>
What
care
I
?

<EOS>
This
toad
of
a
Secretary
is
come
from
Windsor
,
and
I
can
not
find
him
;
and
he
goes
back
on
Sunday
,
and
I
ca
n't
see
him
to
-
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
scurvily
to
-
day
with
Mr.
Lewis
and
a
parson
;
and
then
went
to
see
Lord
Treasurer
,
and
met
him
coming
from
his
house
in
his
coach
:
 
he
smiled
,
and
I
shrugged
,
and
we
smoked
each
other
;
and
so
my
visit
is
paid
.
 
<EOS>
I
now
confine
myself
to
see
him
only
twice
a
week
:
 
he
has
invited
me
to
Windsor
,
and
betwixt
two
stools
,
etc
.
<EOS>
I
will
go
live
at
Windsor
,
if
possible
,
that
's
pozzz
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
always
the
luck
to
pass
my
summer
in
London
.
 
<EOS>
I
called
this
evening
to
see
poor
Sir
Matthew
Dudley
,
a
Commissioner
of
the
Customs
;
I
know
he
is
to
be
out
for
certain
:
 
<EOS>
he
is
in
hopes
of
continuing
:
 
I
would
not
tell
him
bad
news
,
but
advised
him
to
prepare
for
the
worst
.
 
<EOS>
Dilly
was
with
me
this
morning
,
to
invite
me
to
dine
at
Kensington
on
Sunday
with
Lord
Mountjoy
,
who
goes
soon
for
Ireland
.
 
<EOS>
Your
late
Chief
-
Justice
Broderick
is
here
,
and
they
say
violent
as
a
tiger
.
<EOS>
How
is
party
among
you
at
Wexford
?
 
<EOS>
Are
the
majority
of
ladies
for
the
late
or
present
Ministry
?
 
<EOS>
Write
me
Wexford
news
,
and
love
Presto
,
because
he
is
a
good
boy
.
  
<EOS>

<EOS>
Although
it
was
shaving
-
day
,
I
walked
to
Chelsea
,
and
was
there
by
nine
this
morning
;
and
the
Dean
of
Carlisle
<EOS>
and
I
crossed
the
water
to
Battersea
,
and
went
in
his
chariot
to
Greenwich
,
where
we
dined
at
Dr.
Gastrell
's
,
and
passed
the
afternoon
at
Lewisham
,
at
the
Dean
of
Canterbury
's
;
and
there
I
saw
Moll
Stanhope
,
who
is
grown
monstrously
tall
,
but
not
so
handsome
as
formerly
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
the
first
little
rambling
journey
I
have
had
this
summer
about
London
,
and
they
are
the
agreeablest
pastimes
one
can
have
,
in
a
friend
's
coach
,
and
to
good
company
.
 
<EOS>
Bank
Stock
is
fallen
three
or
four
per
cent
.
<EOS>
by
the
whispers
about
the
town
of
the
Queen
's
<EOS>
being
ill
,
<EOS>
who
is
however
very
well
.
  
<EOS>
15
.
 
<EOS>
How
many
books
have
you
carried
with
you
to
Wexford
?
 
<EOS>
What
,
not
one
single
book
?
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
but
your
time
will
be
so
taken
up
;
and
you
can
borrow
of
the
parson
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
to
-
day
with
Sir
Andrew
Fountaine
and
Dilly
at
Kensington
with
Lord
Mountjoy
;
and
in
the
afternoon
Stratford
came
there
,
and
told
me
my
two
hundred
pounds
were
paid
at
last
;
so
that
business
is
over
,
and
I
am
at
ease
about
it
;
and
I
wish
all
your
money
was
in
the
Bank
too
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
have
my
other
hundred
pounds
there
,
that
is
in
Hawkshaw
's
hands
.
 
<EOS>
Have
you
had
the
interest
of
it
paid
yet
?
 
<EOS>
I
ordered
Parvisol
to
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
What
makes
Presto
write
so
crooked
?
 
<EOS>
I
will
answer
your
letter
to
-
morrow
,
and
send
it
on
Tuesday
.
 
<EOS>
Here
's
hot
weather
come
again
,
yesterday
and
to
-
day
:
 
fine
drinking
waters
now
.
 
<EOS>
We
had
a
sad
pert
dull
parson
at
Kensington
to
-
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
almost
repent
my
coming
to
town
;
I
want
the
walks
I
had
.
  
<EOS>
16
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
in
the
City
to
-
day
with
a
hedge
acquaintance
,
and
the
day
passed
without
any
consequence
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
answer
your
letter
to
-
morrow
.
  
<EOS>
17
.
 
<EOS>
Morning
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
put
your
letter
before
me
,
and
am
going
to
answer
it
.
<EOS>
Hold
your
tongue
:
 
stand
by
.
 
<EOS>
Your
weather
and
ours
were
not
alike
;
we
had
not
a
bit
of
hot
weather
in
June
,
yet
you
complain
of
it
on
the
19th
day
.
 
<EOS>
What
,
you
used
to
love
hot
weather
then
?
 
<EOS>
I
could
never
endure
it
:
 
<EOS>
I
detest
and
abominate
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
not
live
in
a
hot
country
,
to
be
king
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
What
a
splutter
you
keep
about
my
bonds
with
Raymond
,
and
all
to
affront
Presto
!
<EOS>
Presto
will
be
suspicious
of
everything
but
MD
,
in
spite
of
your
little
nose
.
<EOS>
Soft
and
fair
,
Madam
Stella
,
how
you
gallop
away
,
in
your
spleen
and
your
rage
,
about
repenting
my
journey
,
and
preferment
here
,
and
sixpence
a
dozen
,
and
nasty
England
,
and
Laracor
all
my
life
.
 
<EOS>
Hey
-
dazy
,
will
you
never
have
done
?
 
<EOS>
I
had
no
offers
of
any
living
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Keeper
told
me
some
months
ago
he
would
give
me
one
when
I
pleased
;
but
I
told
him
I
would
not
take
any
from
him
;
and
the
Secretary
told
me
t'other
day
he
had
refused
a
very
good
one
for
me
,
but
it
was
in
a
place
he
did
not
like
;
and
I
know
nothing
of
getting
anything
here
,
and
,
if
they
would
give
me
leave
,
I
would
come
over
just
now
.
<EOS>
Addison
,
I
hear
,
has
changed
his
mind
about
going
over
;
but
I
have
not
seen
him
these
four
months
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
ay
,
that
's
true
,
Dingley
;
that
's
like
herself
:
millions
of
businesses
to
do
before
she
goes
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
my
head
has
been
pretty
well
,
but
threatening
within
these
two
or
three
days
,
which
I
impute
to
some
fruit
I
ate
;
but
I
will
eat
no
more
:
 
not
a
bit
of
any
sort
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
you
had
a
journey
without
dust
,
and
that
was
happy
.
 
<EOS>
I
long
for
a
Wexford
letter
,
but
must
not
think
of
it
yet
:
 
<EOS>
your
last
was
finished
but
three
weeks
ago
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
d####d
news
<EOS>
you
tell
me
of
Mrs.
F
#
#
#
#
;
it
makes
me
love
England
less
a
great
deal
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
nothing
of
the
trunk
being
left
or
taken
;
<EOS>
so
'
tis
odd
enough
,
if
the
things
in
it
were
mine
;
and
I
think
I
was
told
that
there
are
some
things
for
me
that
my
mother
left
particularly
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
really
sorry
for
;
 
that
scoundrel
  
will
have
his
estate
after
his
mother
's
death
.
<EOS>
Let
me
know
if
Mrs.
Walls
has
got
her
tea
:
 
<EOS>
I
hope
Richardson
stayed
in
Dublin
till
it
came
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Walls
needed
not
have
that
blemish
in
her
eye
;
for
I
am
not
in
love
with
her
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
I
do
not
like
anything
in
the
Examiner
after
the
45th
,
except
the
first
part
of
the
46th
;
all
the
rest
is
trash
;
and
if
you
like
them
,
especially
the
47th
,
your
judgment
is
spoiled
by
ill
company
and
want
of
reading
,
<EOS>
which
I
am
more
sorry
for
than
you
think
:
 
and
I
have
spent
fourteen
years
in
improving
you
to
little
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
(
Mr.
Tooke
is
come
here
,
and
I
must
stop
.
)
 
<EOS>
At
night
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
with
Lord
Treasurer
to
-
day
,
and
he
kept
me
till
nine
;
so
I
can
not
send
this
to
-
night
,
as
I
intended
,
nor
write
some
other
letters
.
 
<EOS>
Green
,
his
surgeon
,
was
there
,
and
dressed
his
breast
;
that
is
,
put
on
a
plaster
,
which
is
still
requisite
:
 
and
I
took
an
opportunity
to
speak
to
him
of
the
Queen
;
but
he
cut
me
short
with
this
saying
,
"
Laissez
faire
a
Don
Antoine
,
"
which
is
a
French
proverb
,
expressing
,
"
Leave
that
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
find
he
is
against
her
taking
much
physic
;
and
I
doubt
he
can
not
persuade
her
to
take
Dr.
Radcliffe
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
she
is
very
well
now
,
and
all
the
story
of
her
illness
,
except
the
first
day
or
two
,
was
a
lie
.
 
<EOS>
We
had
some
business
,
that
company
hindered
us
from
doing
,
though
he
is
earnest
for
it
,
yet
would
not
appoint
me
a
certain
day
,
but
bids
me
come
at
all
times
till
we
can
have
leisure
.
 
<EOS>
This
takes
up
a
great
deal
of
my
time
,
and
I
can
do
nothing
I
would
do
for
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
with
the
Secretary
this
morning
,
and
we
both
think
to
go
to
Windsor
for
some
days
,
to
despatch
an
affair
,
if
we
can
have
leisure
.
 
<EOS>
Sterne
met
me
just
now
in
the
street
by
his
lodgings
,
and
I
went
in
for
an
hour
to
Jemmy
Leigh
,
who
loves
London
dearly
:
 
<EOS>
he
asked
after
you
with
great
respect
and
friendship
.
 
<EOS>
To
return
to
your
letter
.
 
<EOS>
Your
Bishop
Mills
hates
me
mortally
:
 
<EOS>
I
wonder
he
should
speak
well
of
me
,
having
abused
me
in
all
places
where
he
went
.
 
<EOS>
So
you
pay
your
way
.
 
<EOS>
Cudsho
:
 
<EOS>
you
had
a
fine
supper
<EOS>
,
I
warrant
;
two
pullets
,
and
a
bottle
of
wine
,
and
some
currants
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
just
three
weeks
to
-
day
since
you
set
out
to
Wexford
;
you
were
three
days
going
,
and
I
do
not
expect
a
letter
these
ten
days
yet
,
or
rather
this
fortnight
.
 
<EOS>
I
got
a
grant
of
the
Gazette
for
Ben
Tooke
this
morning
from
Mr.
Secretary
:
 
<EOS>
it
will
be
worth
to
him
a
hundred
pounds
a
year
.
  
<EOS>
18
.
 
<EOS>
To
-
day
I
took
leave
of
Mrs.
Barton
,
who
is
going
into
the
country
;
and
I
dined
with
Sir
John
Stanley
,
where
I
have
not
been
this
great
while
.
<EOS>
There
dined
with
us
Lord
Rochester
,
and
his
fine
daughter
,
Lady
Jane
,
just
growing
a
top
-
toast
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
endeavouring
to
save
Sir
Matthew
Dudley
,
but
fear
I
can
not
.
 
<EOS>
I
walked
the
Mall
six
times
to
-
night
for
exercise
,
and
would
have
done
more
;
but
,
as
empty
as
the
town
is
,
a
fool
got
hold
of
me
,
and
so
I
came
home
,
to
tell
you
this
shall
go
to
-
morrow
,
without
fail
,
and
follow
you
to
Wexford
,
like
a
dog
.
  
<EOS>
19
.
 
<EOS>
Dean
Atterbury
sent
to
me
to
dine
with
him
at
Chelsea
.
 
<EOS>
I
refused
his
coach
,
and
walked
,
and
am
come
back
by
seven
,
because
I
would
finish
this
letter
,
and
some
others
I
am
writing
.
 
<EOS>
Patrick
tells
me
the
maid
says
one
Mr.
Walls
,
a
clergyman
,
a
tall
man
,
was
here
to
visit
me
.
 
<EOS>
Is
it
your
Irish
Archdeacon
?
 
<EOS>
I
shall
be
sorry
for
it
;
but
I
shall
make
shift
to
see
him
seldom
enough
,
as
I
do
Dilly
.
 
<EOS>
What
can
he
do
here
?
<EOS>
or
is
it
somebody
else
?
 
<EOS>
The
Duke
of
Newcastle
is
dead
by
the
fall
he
had
from
his
horse
.
 
<EOS>
God
send
poor
Stella
her
health
,
and
keep
MD
happy
!
 
<EOS>
Farewell
,
and
love
Presto
,
who
loves
MD
above
all
things
ten
million
of
times
.
 
<EOS>
God
bless
the
dear
Wexford
girls
.
<EOS>
Farewell
again

LETTER
27
.
 
<EOS>
LONDON
,
July
19
,
1711
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
just
sent
my
26th
,
and
have
nothing
to
say
,
because
I
have
other
letters
to
write
(
pshaw
<EOS>
,
I
began
too
high
)
;
but
I
must
lay
the
beginning
like
a
nest
-
egg
:
 
to
-
morrow
<EOS>
I
will
say
more
,
and
fetch
up
this
line
to
be
straight
.
<EOS>
This
is
enough
at
present
for
two
dear
saucy
naughty
girls
.
  
<EOS>
20
.
 
<EOS>
Have
I
told
you
that
Walls
has
been
with
me
,
and
leaves
the
town
in
three
days
?
 
<EOS>
He
has
brought
no
gown
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
Dilly
carried
him
to
a
play
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
come
upon
a
foolish
errand
,
and
goes
back
as
he
comes
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
this
day
with
Lord
Peterborow
,
who
is
going
another
ramble
:
 
<EOS>
I
believe
I
told
you
so
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
with
Lord
Treasurer
,
but
can
not
get
him
to
do
his
own
business
with
me
;
he
has
put
me
off
till
to
-
morrow
.
  
<EOS>
21
,
22
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
yesterday
with
Lord
Treasurer
,
who
would
needs
take
me
along
with
him
to
Windsor
,
although
I
refused
him
several
times
,
having
no
linen
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
just
time
to
desire
Lord
Forbes
to
call
at
my
lodging
and
order
my
man
to
send
my
things
to
-
day
to
Windsor
by
his
servant
.
 
<EOS>
I
lay
last
night
at
the
Secretary
's
lodgings
at
Windsor
,
and
borrowed
one
of
his
shirts
to
go
to
Court
in
.
 
<EOS>
The
Queen
is
very
well
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
with
Mr.
Masham
;
and
not
hearing
anything
of
my
things
,
I
got
Lord
Winchelsea
to
bring
me
to
town
.
<EOS>
Here
I
found
that
Patrick
had
broke
open
the
closet
to
get
my
linen
and
nightgown
,
and
sent
them
to
Windsor
,
and
there
they
are
;
and
he
,
not
thinking
I
would
return
so
soon
,
is
gone
upon
his
rambles
:
 
<EOS>
so
here
I
am
left
destitute
,
and
forced
to
borrow
a
nightgown
of
my
landlady
,
and
have
not
a
rag
to
put
on
to
-
morrow
:
 
faith
,
it
gives
me
the
spleen
.
  
<EOS>
23
.
 
<EOS>
Morning
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
a
terrible
rainy
day
,
and
rained
prodigiously
on
Saturday
night
.
 
<EOS>
Patrick
lay
out
last
night
,
and
is
not
yet
returned
:
 
faith
<EOS>
,
poor
Presto
is
a
desolate
creature
;
neither
servant
,
nor
linen
,
nor
anything
.
  
<EOS>
Night
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Forbes
's
man
has
brought
back
my
portmantua
,
and
Patrick
is
come
;
so
I
am
in
Christian
circumstances
:
 
<EOS>
I
shall
hardly
commit
such
a
frolic
again
.
 
<EOS>
I
just
crept
out
to
Mrs.
Van
's
,
and
dined
,
and
stayed
there
the
afternoon
:
 
<EOS>
it
has
rained
all
this
day
.
 
<EOS>
Windsor
is
a
delicious
place
:
 
<EOS>
I
never
saw
it
before
,
except
for
an
hour
about
seventeen
years
ago
.
 
<EOS>
Walls
has
been
here
in
my
absence
,
I
suppose
,
to
take
his
leave
;
for
he
designed
not
to
stay
above
five
days
in
London
.
 
<EOS>
He
says
he
and
his
wife
will
come
here
for
some
months
next
year
;
and
,
in
short
,
he
dares
not
stay
now
for
fear
of
her
.
  
<EOS>
24
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
to
-
day
with
a
hedge
friend
in
the
City
;
and
Walls
overtook
me
in
the
street
,
and
told
me
he
was
just
getting
on
horseback
for
Chester
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
as
much
curiosity
as
a
cow
:
 
<EOS>
he
lodged
with
his
horse
in
Aldersgate
Street
:
 
<EOS>
he
has
bought
his
wife
a
silk
gown
,
and
himself
a
hat
.
 
<EOS>
And
what
are
you
doing
?
<EOS>
what
is
poor
MD
doing
now
?
<EOS>
how
do
you
pass
your
time
at
Wexford
?
<EOS>
how
do
the
waters
agree
with
you
?
 
<EOS>
Let
Presto
know
soon
;
for
Presto
longs
to
know
,
and
must
know
.
 
<EOS>
Is
not
Madam
Proby
curious
company
?
 
<EOS>
I
am
afraid
this
rainy
weather
will
spoil
your
waters
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
had
a
great
deal
of
wet
these
three
days
.
 
<EOS>
Tell
me
all
the
particulars
of
Wexford
:
 
<EOS>
the
place
,
the
company
,
the
diversions
,
the
victuals
,
the
wants
,
the
vexations
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
Dingley
never
saw
such
a
place
in
her
life
;
sent
all
over
the
town
for
a
little
parsley
to
a
boiled
chicken
,
and
it
was
not
to
be
had
;
the
butter
is
stark
naught
,
except
an
old
English
woman
's
;
and
it
is
such
a
favour
to
get
a
pound
from
her
now
<EOS>
and
then
!
 
<EOS>
I
am
glad
you
carried
down
your
sheets
with
you
,
else
you
must
have
lain
in
sackcloth
.
 
<EOS>
O
Lord
!
  
<EOS>
25
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
this
forenoon
with
Mr.
Secretary
at
his
office
,
and
helped
to
hinder
a
man
of
his
pardon
,
who
is
condemned
for
a
rape
.
 
<EOS>
The
Under
Secretary
was
willing
to
save
him
,
upon
an
old
notion
that
a
woman
can
not
be
ravished
;
but
I
told
the
Secretary
he
could
not
pardon
him
without
a
favourable
report
from
the
judge
;
besides
,
he
was
a
fiddler
,
and
consequently
a
rogue
,
and
deserved
hanging
for
some
thing
else
;
and
so
he
shall
swing
.
 
<EOS>
What
,
I
must
stand
up
for
the
honour
of
the
fair
sex
!
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
true
the
fellow
had
lain
with
her
a
hundred
times
before
,
but
what
care
I
for
that
!
 
<EOS>
What
,
must
a
woman
be
ravished
because
she
is
a
whore
?
 
<EOS>
The
Secretary
<EOS>
and
I
go
on
Saturday
to
Windsor
for
a
week
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
with
Lord
Treasurer
,
and
stayed
with
him
till
past
ten
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
to
-
day
at
his
levee
,
where
I
went
against
my
custom
,
because
I
had
a
mind
to
do
a
good
office
for
a
gentleman
:
 
<EOS>
so
I
talked
with
him
before
my
lord
,
that
he
might
see
me
,
and
then
found
occasion
to
recommend
him
this
afternoon
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
forced
to
excuse
my
coming
to
the
levee
,
that
I
did
it
to
see
the
sight
;
for
he
was
going
to
chide
me
away
:
 
<EOS>
I
had
never
been
there
but
once
,
and
that
was
long
before
he
was
Treasurer
.
 
<EOS>
The
rooms
were
all
full
,
and
as
many
Whigs
as
Tories
.
 
<EOS>
He
whispered
me
a
jest
or
two
,
and
bid
me
come
to
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
I
left
him
but
just
now
;
and
'
tis
late
.
  
<EOS>
26
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Addison
and
I
have
at
last
met
again
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
with
him
and
Steele
to
-
day
at
young
Jacob
Tonson
's
.
 
<EOS>
The
two
Jacobs
think
it
is
I
who
have
made
the
Secretary
take
from
them
the
printing
of
the
Gazette
,
which
they
are
going
to
lose
,
and
Ben
Tooke
and
another
are
to
have
it
.
 
<EOS>
Jacob
came
to
me
the
other
day
,
to
make
his
court
;
but
I
told
him
it
was
too
late
,
and
that
it
was
not
my
doing
.
 
<EOS>
I
reckon
they
will
lose
it
in
a
week
or
two
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Addison
and
I
talked
as
usual
,
and
as
if
we
had
seen
one
another
yesterday
;
and
Steele
and
I
were
very
easy
,
though
I
writ
him
lately
a
biting
letter
,
in
answer
to
one
of
his
,
where
he
desired
me
to
recommend
a
friend
of
his
to
Lord
Treasurer
.
 
<EOS>
Go
,
get
you
gone
to
your
waters
,
sirrah
.
 
<EOS>
Do
they
give
you
a
stomach
?
 
<EOS>
Do
you
eat
heartily
?
 
<EOS>
We
have
had
much
rain
to
-
day
and
yesterday
.
  
<EOS>
27
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
to
-
day
in
the
City
,
and
saw
poor
Patty
Rolt
,
and
gave
her
a
pistole
to
help
her
a
little
forward
against
she
goes
to
board
in
the
country
.
<EOS>
She
has
but
eighteen
pounds
a
year
to
live
on
,
and
is
forced
to
seek
out
for
cheap
places
.
 
<EOS>
Sometimes
they
raise
their
price
,
and
sometimes
they
starve
her
,
and
then
she
is
forced
to
shift
.
 
<EOS>
Patrick
the
puppy
put
too
much
ink
in
my
standish
,
and
,
carrying
too
many
things
together
<EOS>
,
I
spilled
it
on
my
paper
and
floor
.
 
<EOS>
The
town
is
dull
,
wet
,
and
empty
;
Wexford
is
worth
two
of
it
;
I
hope
so
at
least
,
and
that
poor
little
MD
finds
it
so
.
 
<EOS>
I
reckon
upon
going
to
Windsor
to
-
morrow
with
Mr.
Secretary
,
unless
he
changes
his
mind
,
or
some
other
business
prevents
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
stay
there
a
week
,
I
hope
.
  
<EOS>
28
.
 
<EOS>
Morning
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Secretary
sent
me
word
he
will
call
at
my
lodgings
by
two
this
afternoon
,
to
take
me
to
Windsor
;
so
I
must
dine
nowhere
;
and
I
promised
Lord
Treasurer
to
dine
with
him
to
-
day
;
but
I
suppose
we
shall
dine
at
Windsor
at
five
,
for
we
make
but
three
hours
there
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
going
abroad
,
but
have
left
Patrick
to
put
up
my
things
,
and
to
be
sure
to
be
at
home
half
an
hour
before
two
.
 
<EOS>
Windsor
,
at
night
.
 
<EOS>
We
did
not
leave
London
till
three
,
and
dined
here
between
six
and
seven
;
at
nine
I
left
the
company
,
and
went
to
see
Lord
Treasurer
,
who
is
just
come
.
 
<EOS>
I
chid
him
for
coming
so
late
;
he
chid
me
for
not
dining
with
him
;
said
he
stayed
an
hour
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
Then
I
went
and
sat
with
Mr.
Lewis
till
just
now
,
and
it
is
past
eleven
.
 
<EOS>
I
lie
in
the
same
house
with
the
Secretary
,
one
of
the
Prebendary
's
houses
.
 
<EOS>
The
Secretary
is
not
come
from
his
apartment
in
the
Castle
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
think
that
abominable
dog
Patrick
was
out
after
two
to
-
day
,
and
I
in
a
fright
every
moment
,
for
fear
the
chariot
should
come
;
and
when
he
came
in
,
he
had
not
put
up
one
rag
of
my
things
!
 
<EOS>
I
never
was
in
a
greater
passion
,
and
would
certainly
have
cropped
one
of
his
ears
,
if
I
had
not
looked
every
moment
for
the
Secretary
,
who
sent
his
equipage
to
my
lodging
before
,
and
came
in
a
chair
from
Whitehall
to
me
,
and
happened
to
stay
half
an
hour
later
than
he
intended
.
 
<EOS>
One
of
Lord
Treasurer
's
servants
gave
me
a
letter
to
-
night
:
 
<EOS>
I
found
it
was
from
#
#
#
#
,
 
with
an
offer
of
fifty
pounds
,
to
be
paid
me
in
what
manner
I
pleased
;
because
,
he
said
,
he
desired
to
be
well
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
in
a
rage
;
but
my
friend
Lewis
cooled
me
,
and
said
it
is
what
the
best
men
sometimes
meet
with
;
and
I
have
been
not
seldom
served
in
the
like
manner
,
although
not
so
grossly
.
 
<EOS>
In
these
cases
I
never
demur
a
moment
,
nor
ever
found
the
least
inclination
to
take
anything
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
I
will
go
try
to
sleep
in
my
new
bed
,
and
to
dream
of
poor
Wexford
MD
,
and
Stella
that
drinks
water
,
and
Dingley
that
drinks
ale
.
  
<EOS>

.
 
<EOS>
I
was
at
Court
and
church
to
-
day
,
as
I
was
this
day
<EOS>
se'ennight
:
 
<EOS>
I
generally
am
acquainted
with
about
thirty
in
the
drawing
-
room
,
and
I
am
so
proud
<EOS>
I
make
all
the
lords
come
up
to
me
:
 
<EOS>
one
passes
half
an
hour
pleasant
enough
.
 
<EOS>
We
had
a
dunce
to
preach
before
the
Queen
to
-
day
,
which
often
happens
.
 
<EOS>
Windsor
is
a
delicious
situation
,
but
the
town
is
scoundrel
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
this
morning
got
the
Gazette
for
Ben
Tooke
and
one
Barber
a
printer
;
it
will
be
about
three
hundred
pounds
a
year
between
them
.
 
<EOS>
The
other
fellow
was
printer
of
the
Examiner
,
which
is
now
laid
down
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
with
the
Secretary
:
 
<EOS>
we
were
a
dozen
in
all
,
three
Scotch
lords
,
and
Lord
Peterborow
.
<EOS>
The
Duke
of
Hamilton
would
needs
be
witty
,
and
hold
up
my
train
as
I
walked
upstairs
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
an
ill
circumstance
that
on
Sundays
much
company
always
meet
at
the
great
tables
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Treasurer
told
at
Court
what
I
said
to
Mr.
Secretary
on
this
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
The
Secretary
showed
me
his
bill
of
fare
,
to
encourage
me
to
dine
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Poh
,
"
said
I
,
"
show
me
a
bill
of
company
,
for
I
value
not
your
dinner
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
See
how
this
is
all
blotted
,
I
can
write
no
more
here
,
but
to
tell
you
I
love
MD
dearly
,
and
God
bless
them
.
  
<EOS>
30
.
 
<EOS>
In
my
conscience
,
I
fear
I
shall
have
the
gout
.
 
<EOS>
I
sometimes
feel
pains
about
my
feet
and
toes
:
 
<EOS>
I
never
drank
till
within
these
two
years
,
and
I
did
it
to
cure
my
head
.
 
<EOS>
I
often
sit
evenings
with
some
of
these
people
,
and
drink
in
my
turn
;
but
I
am
now
resolved
to
drink
ten
times
less
than
before
;
but
they
advise
me
to
let
what
I
drink
be
all
wine
,
and
not
to
put
water
to
it
.
<EOS>
Tooke
and
the
printer
stayed
to
-
day
to
finish
their
affair
,
and
treated
me
and
two
of
the
Under
Secretaries
upon
their
getting
the
Gazette
.
 
<EOS>
Then
I
went
to
see
Lord
Treasurer
,
and
chid
him
for
not
taking
notice
of
me
at
Windsor
.
 
<EOS>
He
said
he
kept
a
place
for
me
yesterday
at
dinner
,
and
expected
me
there
;
but
I
was
glad
I
did
not
go
,
because
the
Duke
of
Buckingham
was
there
,
and
that
would
have
made
us
acquainted
;
which
I
have
no
mind
to
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
we
appointed
to
sup
at
Mr.
Masham
's
,
and
there
stayed
till
past
one
o'clock
;
and
that
is
late
,
sirrahs
:
 
<EOS>
and
I
have
much
business
.
  
<EOS>
31
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
sent
a
noble
haunch
of
venison
this
afternoon
to
Mrs.
Vanhomrigh
:
I
wish
you
had
it
,
sirrahs
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
gravely
with
my
landlord
the
Secretary
.
<EOS>
The
Queen
was
abroad
to
-
day
in
order
to
hunt
;
but
,
finding
it
disposed
to
rain
,
she
kept
in
her
coach
;
she
hunts
in
a
chaise
with
one
horse
,
which
she
drives
herself
,
and
drives
furiously
,
like
Jehu
,
and
is
a
mighty
hunter
,
like
Nimrod
.
 
<EOS>
Dingley
has
heard
of
Nimrod
,
but
not
Stella
,
for
it
is
in
the
Bible
.
<EOS>
I
was
to
-
day
at
Eton
,
which
is
but
just
cross
the
bridge
,
to
see
my
Lord
Kerry
's
son
,
who
is
at
school
there
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Secretary
has
given
me
a
warrant
for
a
buck
;
I
ca
n't
send
it
to
MD
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
a
sad
thing
,
faith
,
considering
how
Presto
loves
MD
,
and
how
MD
would
love
Presto
's
venison
for
Presto
's
sake
.
<EOS>
God
bless
the
two
dear
Wexford
girls
!

<EOS>
We
had
for
dinner
the
fellow
of
that
haunch
of
venison
I
sent
to
London
;
'
twas
mighty
fat
and
good
,
and
eight
people
at
dinner
;
that
was
bad
.
<EOS>
The
Queen
and
I
were
going
to
take
the
air
this
afternoon
,
but
not
together
;
and
were
both
hindered
by
a
sudden
rain
.
 
<EOS>
Her
coaches
and
chaises
all
went
back
,
and
the
guards
too
;
and
I
scoured
into
the
market
-
place
for
shelter
.
 
<EOS>
I
intended
to
have
walked
up
the
finest
avenue
I
ever
saw
,
two
miles
long
,
with
two
rows
of
elms
on
each
side
.
 
<EOS>
I
walked
in
the
evening
a
little
upon
the
terrace
,
and
came
home
at
eight
:
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Secretary
came
soon
after
,
and
we
were
engaging
in
deep
discourse
,
and
I
was
endeavouring
to
settle
some
points
of
the
greatest
consequence
,
and
had
wormed
myself
pretty
well
into
him
,
when
his
Under
Secretary
came
in
(
who
lodges
in
the
same
house
with
us
)
and
interrupted
all
my
scheme
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
just
left
him
:
 
<EOS>
it
is
late
,
etc
.

.
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
now
five
days
at
Windsor
,
and
Patrick
has
been
drunk
three
times
that
I
have
seen
,
and
oftener
I
believe
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
lately
had
clothes
that
have
cost
me
five
pounds
,
and
the
dog
thinks
he
has
the
whip
-
hand
of
me
:
 
he
begins
to
master
me
;
so
now
I
am
resolved
to
part
with
him
,
and
will
use
him
without
the
least
pity
.
 
<EOS>
The
Secretary
<EOS>
and
I
have
been
walking
three
or
four
hours
to
-
day
.
 
<EOS>
The
Duchess
of
Shrewsbury
asked
him
,
was
not
that
Dr.
 
Dr.
 
<EOS>
and
she
could
not
say
my
name
in
English
,
but
said
Dr.
Presto
,
which
is
Italian
for
Swift
.
 
<EOS>
Whimsical
enough
,
as
Billy
Swift
says
.
 
<EOS>
I
go
to
-
morrow
with
the
Secretary
to
his
house
at
Bucklebury
,
twenty
-
five
miles
from
hence
,
and
return
early
on
Sunday
morning
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
leave
this
letter
behind
me
locked
up
,
and
give
you
an
account
of
my
journey
when
I
return
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
a
letter
yesterday
from
the
Bishop
of
Clogher
,
who
is
coming
up
to
his
Parliament
.
<EOS>
Have
you
any
correspondence
with
him
to
Wexford
?
 
<EOS>
Methinks
,
I
now
long
for
a
letter
from
you
,
dated
Wexford
,
July
24
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
O
Lord
,
that
would
be
so
pretending
;
and
then
,
says
you
,
Stella
ca
n't
write
much
,
because
it
is
bad
to
write
when
one
drinks
the
waters
;
and
I
think
,
says
you
,
I
find
myself
better
already
,
but
I
can
not
tell
yet
whether
it
be
the
journey
or
the
waters
.
<EOS>
Presto
is
so
silly
to
-
night
;
yes
he
be
;
but
Presto
loves
MD
dearly
,
as
hope
saved
.

<EOS>
Morning
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
to
go
this
day
at
noon
,
as
I
told
you
,
to
Bucklebury
:
 
<EOS>
we
dine
at
twelve
,
and
expect
to
be
there
in
four
hours
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
bid
you
good
-
night
now
,
because
I
shall
be
twenty
-
five
miles
from
this
paper
to
-
night
,
and
so
my
journal
must
have
a
break
;
so
good
-
morrow
,
etc
.
  
<EOS>

,

.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
yesterday
at
Bucklebury
,
where
we
lay
two
nights
,
and
set
out
this
morning
at
eight
,
and
were
here
at
twelve
;
in
four
hours
we
went
twenty
-
six
miles
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Secretary
was
a
perfect
country
gentleman
at
Bucklebury
:
 
<EOS>
he
smoked
tobacco
with
one
or
two
neighbours
;
he
inquired
after
the
wheat
in
such
a
field
;
he
went
to
visit
his
hounds
,
and
knew
all
their
names
;
he
and
his
lady
saw
me
to
my
chamber
just
in
the
country
fashion
.
 
<EOS>
His
house
is
in
the
midst
of
near
three
thousand
pounds
a
year
he
had
by
his
lady
,
who
is
descended
from
Jack
Newbury
,
of
whom
books
and
ballads
are
written
;
and
there
is
an
old
picture
of
him
in
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
She
is
a
great
favourite
of
mine
.
 
<EOS>
I
lost
church
to
-
day
;
but
I
dressed
and
shaved
,
and
went
to
Court
,
and
would
not
dine
with
the
Secretary
,
but
engaged
myself
to
a
private
dinner
with
Mr.
Lewis
,
and
one
friend
more
.
 
<EOS>
We
go
to
London
to
-
morrow
;
for
Lord
Dartmouth
,
the
other
Secretary
,
is
come
,
and
they
are
here
their
weeks
by
turns
.
  
<EOS>

.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Treasurer
comes
every
Saturday
to
Windsor
,
and
goes
away
on
Monday
or
Tuesday
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
with
him
this
morning
at
his
levee
<EOS>
,
for
one
can
not
see
him
otherwise
here
,
he
is
so
hurried
:
 
we
had
some
talk
;
and
I
told
him
I
would
stay
this
week
at
Windsor
by
myself
,
where
I
can
have
more
leisure
to
do
some
business
that
concerns
them
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Treasurer
and
the
Secretary
thought
to
mortify
me
;
for
they
told
me
they
had
been
talking
a
great
deal
of
me
to
-
day
to
the
Queen
,
and
she
said
she
had
never
heard
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
told
them
that
was
their
fault
,
and
not
hers
,
etc
.
,
<EOS>
and
so
we
laughed
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
with
the
Secretary
,
and
let
him
go
to
London
at
five
without
me
;
and
here
am
I
alone
in
the
Prebendary
's
house
,
which
Mr.
Secretary
has
taken
;
only
Mr.
Lewis
is
in
my
neighbourhood
,
and
we
shall
be
good
company
.
 
<EOS>
The
Vice
-
Chamberlain
,
and
Mr.
Masham
,
and
the
Green
Cloth
,
have
promised
me
dinners
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
want
but
four
till
Mr.
Secretary
returns
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
a
music
-
meeting
in
our
town
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
I
went
to
the
rehearsal
of
it
,
and
there
was
Margarita
,
and
her
sister
,
and
another
drab
,
and
a
parcel
of
fiddlers
:
 
<EOS>
I
was
weary
,
and
would
not
go
to
the
meeting
,
which
I
am
sorry
for
,
because
I
heard
it
was
a
great
assembly
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Lewis
came
from
it
,
and
sat
with
me
till
just
now
;
and
'
tis
late
.
  
<EOS>
7
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
do
no
business
,
I
fear
,
because
Mr.
Lewis
,
who
has
nothing
or
little
to
do
here
,
sticks
close
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
today
with
the
gentlemen
ushers
,
among
scurvy
company
;
but
the
Queen
was
hunting
the
stag
till
four
this
afternoon
,
and
she
drove
in
her
chaise
above
forty
miles
,
and
it
was
five
before
we
went
to
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
Here
are
fine
walks
about
this
town
.
 
<EOS>
I
sometimes
walk
up
the
avenue
.
  
<EOS>

.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
Drawing
-
room
to
-
day
at
Court
;
but
so
few
company
,
that
the
Queen
sent
for
us
into
her
bed
-
chamber
,
where
we
made
our
bows
,
and
stood
about
twenty
of
us
round
the
room
,
while
she
looked
at
us
round
with
her
fan
in
her
mouth
,
and
once
a
minute
said
about
three
words
to
some
that
were
nearest
her
,
and
then
she
was
told
dinner
was
ready
,
and
went
out
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
at
the
Green
Cloth
,
by
Mr.
Scarborow
's
invitation
,
who
is
in
waiting
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
much
the
best
table
in
England
,
and
costs
the
Queen
a
thousand
pounds
a
month
while
she
is
at
Windsor
or
Hampton
Court
,
and
is
the
only
mark
of
magnificence
or
hospitality
I
can
see
in
the
Queen
's
family
:
 
<EOS>
it
is
designed
to
entertain
foreign
Ministers
,
and
people
of
quality
,
who
come
to
see
the
Queen
,
and
have
no
place
to
dine
at
.

<EOS>
Mr.
Coke
,
the
Vice
-
Chamberlain
,
made
me
a
long
visit
this
morning
,
and
invited
me
to
dinner
;
but
the
toast
,
his
lady
,
was
unfortunately
engaged
to
Lady
Sunderland
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Treasurer
stole
here
last
night
,
but
did
not
lie
at
his
lodgings
in
the
Castle
;
and
,
after
seeing
the
Queen
,
went
back
again
.
<EOS>
I
just
drank
a
dish
of
chocolate
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
fancy
<EOS>
I
shall
have
reason
to
be
angry
with
him
very
soon
;
but
what
care
I
?
 
<EOS>
I
believe
I
shall
die
with
Ministries
in
my
debt
.
 
<EOS>
This
night
I
received
a
certain
letter
from
a
place
called
Wexford
,
from
two
dear
naughty
girls
of
my
acquaintance
;
but
,
faith
,
I
will
not
answer
it
here
,
no
in
troth
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
send
this
to
Mr.
Reading
,
supposing
it
will
find
you
returned
;
and
I
hope
better
for
the
waters
.

<EOS>
Mr.
Vice
-
Chamberlain
lent
me
his
horses
to
ride
about
and
see
the
country
this
morning
.
 
<EOS>
Dr.
Arbuthnot
,
the
Queen
's
physician
and
favourite
,
went
out
with
me
to
show
me
the
places
:
 
<EOS>
we
went
a
little
after
the
Queen
,
and
overtook
Miss
Forester
,
a
maid
of
honour
,
on
her
palfrey
,
taking
the
air
;
we
made
her
go
along
with
us
.
 
<EOS>
We
saw
a
place
they
have
made
for
a
famous
horse
-
race
to
-
morrow
,
where
the
Queen
will
come
.
 
<EOS>
We
met
the
Queen
coming
back
,
and
Miss
Forester
stood
,
like
us
,
with
her
hat
off
while
the
Queen
went
by
.
 
<EOS>
The
Doctor
<EOS>
and
I
left
the
lady
where
we
found
her
,
but
under
other
conductors
;
and
we
dined
at
a
little
place
he
has
taken
,
about
a
mile
off
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
came
back
<EOS>
I
found
Mr.
Scarborow
had
sent
all
about
to
invite
me
to
the
Green
Cloth
,
and
lessened
his
company
on
purpose
to
make
me
easy
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
very
obliging
,
and
will
cost
me
thanks
.
 
<EOS>
Much
company
is
come
to
town
this
evening
,
to
see
to-
morrow
's
race
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
tired
with
riding
a
trotting
mettlesome
horse
a
dozen
miles
,
having
not
been
on
horseback
this
twelvemonth
.
 
<EOS>
And
Miss
Forester
did
not
make
it
easier
;
she
is
a
silly
true
maid
of
honour
,
and
I
did
not
like
her
,
although
she
be
a
toast
,
and
was
dressed
like
a
man
.
  
<EOS>
11
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
send
this
letter
to
-
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
expect
the
Secretary
by
noon
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
not
go
to
the
race
unless
I
can
get
room
in
some
coach
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
now
morning
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
rise
,
and
fold
up
and
seal
my
letter
.
 
<EOS>
Farewell
,
and
God
preserve
dearest
MD
.
  
<EOS>
I
believe
I
shall
leave
this
town
on
Monday
.

LETTER
28
.
 
<EOS>
WINDSOR
,
Aug.
11
,
1711
.
  
<EOS>
I
sent
away
my
twenty
-
seventh
this
morning
in
an
express
to
London
,
and
directed
to
Mr.
Reading
:
 
this
shall
go
to
your
lodgings
,
where
I
reckon
you
will
be
returned
before
it
reaches
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
intended
to
go
to
the
race
to
-
day
,
but
was
hindered
by
a
visit
:
 
<EOS>
I
believe
I
told
you
so
in
my
last
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
to
-
day
at
the
Green
Cloth
,
where
everybody
had
been
at
the
race
but
myself
,
and
we
were
twenty
in
all
,
and
very
noisy
company
;
but
I
made
the
Vice
-
Chamberlain
and
two
friends
more
sit
at
a
side
table
,
to
be
a
little
quiet
.
 
<EOS>
At
six
I
went
to
see
the
Secretary
,
who
is
returned
;
but
Lord
Keeper
sent
to
desire
I
would
sup
with
him
,
where
I
stayed
till
just
now
:
 
<EOS>
Lord
Treasurer
and
Secretary
were
to
come
to
us
,
but
both
failed
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
late
,
etc
.
  
<EOS>
12
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
this
morning
to
visit
Lord
Keeper
,
who
made
me
reproaches
that
I
had
never
visited
him
at
Windsor
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
a
present
sent
him
of
delicious
peaches
,
and
he
was
champing
and
champing
,
but
<EOS>
I
durst
not
eat
one
;
I
wished
Dingley
had
some
of
them
,
for
poor
Stella
can
no
more
eat
fruit
than
Presto
.
<EOS>
Dilly
Ashe
is
come
to
Windsor
;
and
after
church
I
carried
him
up
to
the
drawing
-
room
,
and
talked
to
the
Keeper
and
Treasurer
,
on
purpose
to
show
them
to
him
;
and
he
saw
the
Queen
and
several
great
lords
,
and
the
Duchess
of
Montagu
;
he
was
mighty
happy
,
and
resolves
to
fill
a
letter
to
the
Bishop
.
 
<EOS>
My
friend
Lewis
<EOS>
and
I
dined
soberly
with
Dr.
Adams
,
the
only
neighbour
prebendary
.
 
<EOS>
One
of
the
prebendaries
here
is
lately
a
peer
,
by
the
death
of
his
father
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
now
Lord
Willoughby
of
Broke
,
and
will
sit
in
the
House
of
Lords
with
his
gown
.
 
<EOS>
I
supped
to
-
night
at
Masham
's
with
Lord
Treasurer
,
Mr.
Secretary
,
and
Prior
.
 
<EOS>
The
Treasurer
made
us
stay
till
twelve
,
before
he
came
from
the
Queen
,
and
'
tis
now
past
two
.
  
<EOS>
13
.
 
<EOS>
I
reckoned
upon
going
to
London
to
-
day
;
but
by
an
accident
the
Cabinet
Council
did
not
sit
last
night
,
and
sat
to
-
day
,
so
we
go
to
-
morrow
at
six
in
the
morning
.
 
<EOS>
I
missed
the
race
to
-
day
by
coming
out
too
late
,
when
everybody
's
coach
was
gone
,
and
ride
I
would
not
:
 
<EOS>
I
felt
my
last
riding
three
days
after
.
 
<EOS>
We
had
a
dinner
to
-
day
at
the
Secretary
's
lodgings
without
him
:
<EOS>
Mr.
Hare
,
his
Under
Secretary
,
Mr.
Lewis
,
Brigadier
Sutton
,
and
I
,
dined
together
;
and
I
made
the
Vice
-
Chamberlain
take
a
snap
with
us
,
rather
than
stay
till
five
for
his
lady
,
who
was
gone
to
the
race
.
 
<EOS>
The
reason
why
the
Cabinet
Council
was
not
held
last
night
was
because
Mr.
Secretary
St.
John
would
not
sit
with
your
Duke
of
Somerset
.
 
<EOS>
So
to
-
day
the
Duke
was
forced
to
go
to
the
race
while
the
Cabinet
was
held
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
music
-
meetings
in
our
town
,
and
I
was
at
the
rehearsal
t'other
day
;
but
I
did
not
value
it
,
nor
would
go
to
the
meeting
.
 
<EOS>
Did
I
tell
you
this
before
?
  
<EOS>
London
,
14
.
 
<EOS>
We
came
to
town
this
day
in
two
hours
and
forty
minutes
:
 
<EOS>
twenty
miles
are
nothing
here
.
 
<EOS>
I
found
a
letter
from
the
Archbishop
of
Dublin
,
sent
me
the
Lord
knows
how
.
 
<EOS>
He
says
some
of
the
bishops
will
hardly
believe
that
Lord
Treasurer
got
the
Queen
to
remit
the
First
-
Fruits
before
the
Duke
of
Ormond
was
declared
Lord
Lieutenant
,
and
that
the
bishops
have
written
a
letter
to
Lord
Treasurer
to
thank
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
sent
me
the
address
of
the
Convocation
,
ascribing
,
in
good
part
,
that
affair
to
the
Duke
,
who
had
less
share
in
it
than
MD
;
for
if
it
had
not
been
for
MD
,
I
should
not
have
been
so
good
a
solicitor
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
to
-
day
in
the
City
,
about
a
little
bit
of
mischief
,
with
a
printer
.
 
<EOS>
I
found
Mrs.
Vanhomrigh
all
in
combustion
,
squabbling
with
her
rogue
of
a
landlord
;
she
has
left
her
house
,
and
gone
out
of
our
neighbourhood
a
good
way
.
 
<EOS>
Her
eldest
daughter
is
come
of
age
,
and
going
to
Ireland
to
look
after
her
fortune
,
and
get
it
in
her
own
hands
.
  
<EOS>
15
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
to
-
day
with
Mrs.
Van
,
who
goes
to
-
night
to
her
new
lodgings
.
 
<EOS>
I
went
at
six
to
see
Lord
Treasurer
;
but
his
company
was
gone
,
contrary
to
custom
,
and
he
was
busy
,
and
I
was
forced
to
stay
some
time
before
I
could
see
him
.
 
<EOS>
We
were
together
hardly
an
hour
,
and
he
went
away
,
being
in
haste
.
 
<EOS>
He
desired
me
to
dine
with
him
on
Friday
,
because
there
would
be
a
friend
of
his
that
I
must
see
:
 
<EOS>
my
Lord
Harley
told
me
,
when
he
was
gone
,
that
it
was
Mrs.
Masham
his
father
meant
,
who
is
come
to
town
to
lie
-
in
,
and
whom
I
never
saw
,
though
her
husband
is
one
of
our
Society
.
 
<EOS>
God
send
her
a
good
time
!
<EOS>
her
death
would
be
a
terrible
thing
.
 
<EOS>
D
o
you
know
that
I
have
ventured
all
my
credit
with
these
great
Ministers
,
to
clear
some
misunderstandings
betwixt
them
;
and
<EOS>
if
there
be
no
breach
,
I
ought
to
have
the
merit
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
a
plaguy
ticklish
piece
of
work
,
and
<EOS>
a
man
hazards
losing
both
sides
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
a
pity
the
world
does
not
know
my
virtue
.
 
<EOS>
I
thought
the
clergy
in
Convocation
in
Ireland
would
have
given
me
thanks
for
being
their
solicitor
;
but
I
hear
of
no
such
thing
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
talk
occasionally
on
that
subject
,
and
let
me
know
what
you
hear
.
<EOS>
Do
you
know
the
greatness
of
my
spirit
,
that
I
value
their
thanks
not
a
rush
,
but
at
my
return
shall
freely
let
all
people
know
that
it
was
my
Lord
Treasurer
's
action
,
wherein
the
Duke
of
Ormond
had
no
more
share
than
a
cat
?
<EOS>
And
so
they
may
go
whistle
,
and
I
'll
go
sleep
.
  
<EOS>
16
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
this
day
in
the
City
,
and
dined
at
Pontack
's
with
Stratford
,
and
two
other
merchants
.
 
<EOS>
Pontack
told
us
,
although
his
wine
was
so
good
,
he
sold
it
cheaper
than
others
;
he
took
but
seven
shillings
a
flask
.
 
<EOS>
Are
not
these
pretty
rates
?
 
<EOS>
The
books
he
sent
for
from
Hamburg
are
come
,
but
not
yet
got
out
of
the
custom
-
house
.
 
<EOS>
My
library
will
be
at
least
double
when
I
come
back
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
go
to
Windsor
again
on
Saturday
,
to
meet
our
Society
,
who
are
to
sup
at
Mr.
Secretary
's
;
but
I
believe
I
shall
return
on
Monday
,
and
then
I
will
answer
your
letter
,
<EOS>
that
lies
here
safe
underneath
;
 
<EOS>
I
see
it
;
lie
still
:
<EOS>
I
will
answer
you
when
the
ducks
have
eaten
up
the
dirt
.
  
<EOS>
17
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
to
-
day
at
Lord
Treasurer
's
with
Mrs.
Masham
,
and
she
is
extremely
like
one
<EOS>
Mrs.
Malolly
,
that
was
once
my
landlady
in
Trim
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
used
with
mighty
kindness
and
respect
,
like
a
favourite
.
 
<EOS>
It
signifies
nothing
going
to
this
Lord
Treasurer
about
business
,
although
it
be
his
own
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
in
haste
,
and
desires
I
will
come
again
,
and
dine
with
him
to
-
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
His
famous
lying
porter
is
fallen
sick
,
and
they
think
he
will
die
:
 
<EOS>
I
wish
I
had
all
my
half
-
crowns
again
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
I
have
told
you
he
is
an
old
Scotch
fanatic
,
and
the
damn'dest
liar
in
his
office
alive
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
mind
to
recommend
Patrick
to
succeed
him
:
 
<EOS>
I
have
trained
him
up
pretty
well
.
 
<EOS>
I
reckon
for
certain
you
are
now
in
town
.
 
<EOS>
The
weather
now
begins
to
alter
to
rain
.
  
<EOS>
Windsor
,
18
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
to
-
day
with
Lord
Treasurer
,
and
he
would
make
me
go
with
him
to
Windsor
,
although
I
was
engaged
to
the
Secretary
,
to
whom
I
made
my
excuses
:
 
we
had
in
the
coach
besides
,
his
son
and
son
-
in
-
law
,
Lord
Harley
and
Lord
Dupplin
,
who
are
two
of
our
Society
,
and
seven
of
us
met
by
appointment
,
and
supped
this
night
with
the
Secretary
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
past
nine
before
we
got
here
,
but
<EOS>
a
fine
moonshiny
night
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
go
back
,
I
believe
,
on
Monday
.
'
<EOS>
Tis
very
late
.
  
<EOS>
19
.
 
<EOS>
The
Queen
did
not
stir
out
to
-
day
,
she
is
in
a
little
fit
of
the
gout
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
at
Mr.
Masham
's
;
we
had
none
but
our
Society
members
,
six
in
all
,
and
I
supped
with
Lord
Treasurer
.
 
<EOS>
The
Queen
has
ordered
twenty
thousand
pounds
to
go
on
with
the
building
at
Blenheim
,
which
has
been
starved
till
now
,
since
the
change
of
the
Ministry
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
it
is
to
reward
his
last
action
of
getting
into
the
French
lines
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Treasurer
kept
me
till
past
twelve
.
  
<EOS>
London
,
20
.
 
<EOS>
It
rained
terribly
every
step
of
our
journey
to
-
day
:
 
<EOS>
I
returned
with
the
Secretary
after
a
dinner
of
cold
meat
,
and
went
to
Mrs.
Van
's
,
where
I
sat
the
evening
.
 
<EOS>
I
grow
very
idle
,
because
I
have
a
great
deal
of
business
.
<EOS>
Tell
me
how
you
passed
your
time
at
Wexford
;
and
are
not
you
glad
at
heart
<EOS>
you
have
got
home
safe
to
your
lodgings
at
St.
Mary
's
,
pray
?
 
<EOS>
And
so
your
friends
come
to
visit
you
;
and
Mrs.
Walls
is
much
better
of
her
eye
;
and
the
Dean
is
just
as
he
used
to
be
:
 
and
what
does
Walls
say
of
London
?
'
<EOS>
tis
a
reasoning
coxcomb
.
 
<EOS>
And
Goody
Stoyte
,
and
Hannah
<EOS>
what
d'ye
call
her
;
no
,
her
name
an't
Hannah
,
Catherine
<EOS>
I
mean
;
they
were
so
glad
to
see
the
ladies
again
!
<EOS>
and
Mrs.
Manley
wanted
a
companion
at
ombre
.
  
<EOS>
21
.
 
<EOS>
I
writ
to
-
day
to
the
Archbishop
of
Dublin
,
and
enclosed
a
long
politic
paper
by
itself
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
the
bishops
are
all
angry
(
smoke
the
wax
-
candle
drop
at
the
bottom
of
this
paper
)
<EOS>
I
have
let
the
world
know
<EOS>
the
First
-
Fruits
were
got
by
Lord
Treasurer
before
the
Duke
of
Ormond
was
Governor
.
 
<EOS>
I
told
Lord
Treasurer
all
this
,
and
he
is
very
angry
;
but
I
pacified
him
again
by
telling
him
they
were
fools
,
and
knew
nothing
of
what
passed
here
;
but
thought
all
was
well
enough
if
they
complimented
the
Duke
of
Ormond
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Treasurer
gave
me
t'other
day
a
letter
of
thanks
he
received
from
the
bishops
of
Ireland
,
signed
by
seventeen
;
and
says
he
will
write
them
an
answer
.
 
<EOS>
The
Dean
of
Carlisle
sat
with
me
to
-
day
till
three
;
and
I
went
to
dine
with
Lord
Treasurer
,
who
dined
abroad
,
so
did
the
Secretary
,
and
I
was
left
in
the
suds
.
'
<EOS>
Twas
almost
four
,
and
I
got
to
Sir
Matthew
Dudley
,
who
had
half
dined
.
<EOS>
Thornhill
,
who
killed
Sir
Cholmley
Dering
,
was
murdered
by
two
men
,
on
Turnham
Green
,
last
Monday
night
:
 
as
they
stabbed
him
,
they
bid
him
remember
Sir
Cholmley
Dering
.
 
<EOS>
They
had
quarrelled
at
Hampton
Court
,
and
followed
and
stabbed
him
on
horseback
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
only
a
Grub
Street
paper
of
it
,
but
I
believe
it
is
true
.
 
<EOS>
I
went
myself
through
Turnham
Green
the
same
night
,
which
was
yesterday
.
  
<EOS>
22
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
had
terrible
rains
these
two
or
three
days
.
 
<EOS>
I
intended
to
dine
at
Lord
Treasurer
's
,
but
went
to
see
Lady
Abercorn
,
who
is
come
to
town
,
and
my
lord
;
and
I
dined
with
them
,
and
visited
Lord
Treasurer
this
evening
.
 
<EOS>
His
porter
is
mending
.
 
<EOS>
I
sat
with
my
lord
about
three
hours
,
and
am
come
home
early
to
be
busy
.
 
<EOS>
Passing
by
White
's
Chocolate
-
house
,
my
brother
Masham
called
me
,
and
told
me
his
wife
was
brought
to
bed
of
a
boy
,
and
both
very
well
.
 
<EOS>
(
Our
Society
,
you
must
know
,
are
all
brothers
.
)
 
<EOS>
Dr.
Garth
told
us
that
Mr.
Henley
is
dead
of
an
apoplexy
.
 
<EOS>
His
brother
-
in
-
law
,
Earl
Poulett
,
is
gone
down
to
the
Grange
,
to
take
care
of
his
funeral
.
 
<EOS>
The
Earl
of
Danby
,
the
Duke
of
Leeds
's
eldest
grandson
,
a
very
hopeful
young
man
of
about
twenty
,
is
dead
at
Utrecht
of
the
smallpox
.
 
<EOS>
I
long
to
know
whether
you
begin
to
have
any
good
effect
by
your
waters
.
 
<EOS>
Methinks
this
letter
goes
on
slowly
;
'
twill
be
a
fortnight
next
Saturday
since
it
was
begun
,
and
one
side
not
filled
.
 
<EOS>
O
fie
for
shame
,
Presto
!
 
<EOS>
Faith
,
I
'm
so
tosticated
to
and
from
Windsor
,
<EOS>
that
I
know
not
what
to
say
;
but
,
faith
,
I
'll
go
to
Windsor
again
on
Saturday
,
if
they
ask
me
,
not
else
.
 
<EOS>
So
lose
your
money
again
,
now
you
are
come
home
;
do
,
sirrah
.
  
<EOS>
Take
your
magnifying
-
glass
,
Madam
Dingley
.
  
<EOS>
You
sha
n't
read
this
,
sirrah
Stella
;
do
n't
read
it
for
your
life
,
for
fear
of
your
dearest
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
There
's
enough
for
this
side
;
these
Ministers
hinder
me
.
 
<EOS>
Pretty
,
dear
,
little
,
naughty
,
saucy
MD
.
  
<EOS>
Silly
,
impudent
,
loggerhead
Presto
.

<EOS>
Dilly
<EOS>
and
I
dined
to
-
day
with
Lord
Abercorn
,
and
had
a
fine
fat
haunch
of
venison
,
that
smelt
rarely
on
one
side
:
 
and
after
dinner
Dilly
won
half
a
crown
of
me
at
backgammon
at
his
lodgings
,
to
his
great
content
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
a
scurvy
empty
town
this
melancholy
season
of
the
year
;
but
I
think
our
weather
begins
to
mend
.
 
<EOS>
The
roads
are
as
deep
as
in
winter
.
 
<EOS>
The
grapes
are
sad
things
;
but
the
peaches
are
pretty
good
,
and
there
are
some
figs
.
 
<EOS>
I
sometimes
venture
to
eat
one
,
but
always
repent
it
.
 
<EOS>
You
say
nothing
of
the
box
sent
half
a
year
ago
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
you
would
pay
me
for
Mrs.
Walls
's
tea
.
 
<EOS>
Your
mother
is
in
the
country
,
I
suppose
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
send
me
the
account
of
MD
,
Madam
Dingley
,
as
it
stands
since
November
,
that
is
to
say
,
for
this
year
(
excluding
the
twenty
pounds
lent
Stella
for
Wexford
)
,
for
I
can
not
look
in
your
letters
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
ordered
that
Hawkshaw
's
interest
should
be
paid
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
When
you
think
proper
,
I
will
let
Parvisol
know
you
have
paid
that
twenty
pounds
,
or
part
of
it
;
and
so
go
play
with
the
Dean
,
and
I
will
answer
your
letter
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
Good
-
night
,
sirrahs
,
and
love
Presto
,
and
be
good
girls
.
  
<EOS>

<EOS>
I
dined
to
-
day
with
Lord
Treasurer
,
who
chid
me
for
not
dining
with
him
yesterday
,
<EOS>
for
it
seems
I
did
not
understand
his
invitation
;
and
their
Club
of
the
Ministry
dined
together
,
and
expected
me
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Radnor
and
I
were
walking
the
Mall
this
evening
;
and
Mr.
Secretary
met
us
,
and
took
a
turn
or
two
,
and
then
stole
away
,
and
we
both
believed
it
was
to
pick
up
some
wench
;
and
to
-
morrow
he
will
be
at
the
Cabinet
with
the
Queen
:
 
so
goes
the
world
!
<EOS>
Prior
has
been
out
of
town
<EOS>
these
two
months
,
nobody
knows
where
,
and
is
lately
returned
.
 
<EOS>
People
confidently
affirm
he
has
been
in
France
,
and
I
half
believe
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
said
he
was
sent
by
the
Ministry
,
and
for
some
overtures
towards
a
peace
.
 
<EOS>
The
Secretary
pretends
<EOS>
he
knows
nothing
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
your
Parliament
will
be
dissolved
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
talking
about
the
quarrel
between
your
Lords
and
Commons
with
Lord
Treasurer
,
and
did
,
at
the
request
of
some
people
,
desire
that
the
Queen
's
answer
to
the
Commons
'
address
might
express
a
dislike
of
some
principles
,
etc
.
;
but
was
answered
dubiously
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
now
to
your
letter
,
fair
ladies
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
drinking
is
bad
;
I
mean
writing
is
bad
in
drinking
the
waters
;
and
was
angry
to
see
so
much
in
Stella
's
hand
.
 
<EOS>
But
why
Dingley
drinks
them
,
I
can
not
imagine
;
but
truly
she
'll
drink
waters
as
well
as
Stella
:
 
<EOS>
why
not
?
 
<EOS>
I
hope
you
now
find
the
benefit
of
them
since
you
are
returned
;
pray
let
me
know
particularly
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
glad
you
are
forced
upon
exercise
,
which
,
I
believe
,
is
as
good
as
the
waters
for
the
heart
of
them
.
'
<EOS>
Tis
now
past
the
middle
of
August
;
so
by
your
reckoning
you
are
in
Dublin
.
<EOS>
It
would
vex
me
to
the
dogs
that
letters
should
miscarry
between
Dublin
and
Wexford
,
after
"
scaping
the
salt
seas
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
write
no
more
to
that
nasty
town
in
haste
again
,
I
warrant
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
four
Sundays
together
at
Windsor
,
of
which
a
fortnight
together
;
but
I
believe
I
shall
not
go
to
-
morrow
,
for
I
will
not
,
unless
the
Secretary
asks
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
all
your
news
about
the
Mayor
:
 
<EOS>
it
makes
no
noise
here
at
all
,
but
the
quarrel
of
your
Parliament
does
;
it
is
so
very
extraordinary
,
and
the
language
of
the
Commons
so
very
pretty
.
 
<EOS>
The
Examiner
has
been
down
this
month
,
and
was
very
silly
the
five
or
six
last
papers
;
but
there
is
a
pamphlet
come
out
,
in
answer
to
a
letter
to
the
seven
Lords
who
examined
Gregg
.
 
<EOS>
The
Answer
is
by
the
real
author
of
the
Examiner
,
as
I
believe
;
for
it
is
very
well
written
.
 
<EOS>
We
had
Trapp
's
poem
on
the
Duke
of
Ormond
printed
here
,
and
the
printer
sold
just
eleven
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
a
dull
piece
,
not
half
so
good
as
Stella
's
;
and
<EOS>
she
is
very
modest
to
compare
herself
with
such
a
poetaster
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
heartily
sorry
for
poor
Mrs.
Parnell
's
death
;
she
seemed
to
be
an
excellent
good
-
natured
young
woman
,
and
I
believe
the
poor
lad
is
much
afflicted
;
they
appeared
to
live
perfectly
well
together
.
 
<EOS>
Dilly
is
not
tired
at
all
with
England
,
but
intends
to
continue
here
a
good
while
:
 
<EOS>
he
is
mighty
easy
to
be
at
distance
from
his
two
sisters
-
in
-
law
.
 
<EOS>
He
finds
some
sort
of
scrub
acquaintance
;
goes
now
and
then
in
disguise
to
a
play
;
smokes
his
pipe
;
reads
now
and
then
a
little
trash
,
and
what
else
the
Lord
knows
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
him
now
and
then
;
for
he
calls
here
,
and
the
town
being
thin
,
I
am
less
pestered
with
company
than
usual
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
got
rid
of
many
of
my
solicitors
,
by
doing
nothing
for
them
:
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
above
eight
or
nine
left
,
and
I
'll
be
as
kind
to
them
.
 
<EOS>
Did
I
tell
you
of
a
knight
who
desired
me
to
speak
to
Lord
Treasurer
to
give
him
two
thousand
pounds
,
or
five
hundred
pounds
a
year
,
until
he
could
get
something
better
?
 
<EOS>
I
honestly
delivered
my
message
to
the
Treasurer
,
adding
,
the
knight
was
a
puppy
,
whom
I
would
not
give
a
groat
to
save
from
the
gallows
.
 
<EOS>
Cole
Reading
's
father
-
in
-
law
has
been
two
or
three
times
at
me
,
to
recommend
his
lights
to
the
Ministry
,
assuring
me
that
a
word
of
mine
would
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
Did
not
that
dog
use
to
speak
ill
of
me
,
and
profess
to
hate
me
?
 
<EOS>
He
knows
not
where
I
lodge
,
for
I
told
him
I
lived
in
the
country
;
and
I
have
ordered
Patrick
to
deny
me
constantly
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
Did
the
Bishop
of
London
die
in
Wexford
?
<EOS>
poor
gentleman
!
 
<EOS>
Did
he
drink
the
waters
?
<EOS>
were
you
at
his
burial
?
<EOS>
was
it
a
great
funeral
?
<EOS>
so
far
from
his
friends
!
 
<EOS>
But
he
was
very
old
:
 
<EOS>
we
shall
all
follow
.
<EOS>
And
yet
it
was
a
pity
,
if
God
pleased
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
a
good
man
;
not
very
learned
:
I
believe
he
died
but
poor
.
 
<EOS>
Did
he
leave
any
charity
legacies
?
<EOS>
who
held
up
his
pall
?
<EOS>
was
there
a
great
sight
of
clergy
?
<EOS>
do
they
design
a
tomb
for
him
?
  
<EOS>
Are
you
sure
it
was
the
Bishop
of
London
?
<EOS>
because
there
is
an
elderly
gentleman
here
that
we
give
the
same
title
to
:
 
or
did
you
fancy
all
this
in
your
water
,
as
others
do
strange
things
in
their
wine
?
 
<EOS>
They
say
these
waters
trouble
the
head
,
and
make
people
imagine
what
never
came
to
pass
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
make
no
more
of
killing
a
Bishop
?
<EOS>
are
these
your
Whiggish
tricks
?
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
yes
,
I
see
you
are
in
a
fret
.
 
<EOS>
O
,
faith
<EOS>
,
says
you
,
saucy
Presto
,
I
'll
break
your
head
;
what
,
ca
n't
one
report
what
one
hears
,
without
being
made
a
jest
and
a
laughing
-
stock
?
 
<EOS>
Are
these
your
English
tricks
,
with
a
murrain
?
 
<EOS>
And
Sacheverell
will
be
the
next
Bishop
?
 
<EOS>
He
would
be
glad
of
an
addition
of
two
hundred
pounds
a
year
to
what
he
has
,
and
that
is
more
than
they
will
give
him
,
for
aught
I
see
.
 
<EOS>
He
hates
the
new
Ministry
mortally
,
and
they
hate
him
,
and
pretend
to
despise
him
too
.
 
<EOS>
They
will
not
allow
him
to
have
been
the
occasion
of
the
late
change
;
at
least
some
of
them
will
not
:
 
<EOS>
but
my
Lord
Keeper
owned
it
to
me
the
other
day
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
Mr.
Addison
does
not
go
to
Ireland
this
year
:
 
<EOS>
he
pretended
he
would
;
but
he
is
gone
to
Bath
with
Pastoral
Philips
,
for
his
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
So
now
I
have
run
over
your
letter
;
and
I
think
this
shall
go
to
-
morrow
,
which
will
be
just
a
fortnight
from
the
last
,
and
bring
things
to
the
old
form
again
,
after
your
rambles
to
Wexford
,
and
mine
to
Windsor
.
 
<EOS>
Are
there
not
many
literal
faults
in
my
letters
?
 
<EOS>
I
never
read
them
over
,
and
I
fancy
there
are
.
 
<EOS>
What
do
you
do
then
?
<EOS>
do
you
guess
my
meaning
,
or
are
you
acquainted
with
my
manner
of
mistaking
?
 
<EOS>
I
lost
my
handkerchief
in
the
Mall
to
-
night
with
Lord
Radnor
;
but
I
made
him
walk
with
me
to
find
it
,
and
find
it
I
did
not
.
 
<EOS>
Tisdall
(
that
lodges
with
me
)
and
I
have
had
no
conversation
,
nor
do
we
pull
off
our
hats
in
the
streets
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
a
cousin
of
his
(
I
suppose
,
)
a
young
parson
,
that
lodges
in
the
house
too
;
a
handsome
,
genteel
fellow
.
 
<EOS>
Dick
Tighe
and
his
wife
lodged
over
against
us
;
and
he
has
been
seen
,
out
of
our
upper
windows
,
beating
her
two
or
three
times
:
 
<EOS>
they
are
both
gone
to
Ireland
,
but
not
together
;
and
he
solemnly
vows
never
to
live
with
her
.
 
<EOS>
Neighbours
do
not
stick
to
say
that
she
has
a
tongue
:
 
in
short
,
I
am
told
she
is
the
most
urging
,
provoking
devil
that
ever
was
born
;
and
he
a
hot
,
whiffling
puppy
,
very
apt
to
resent
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
keep
this
bottom
till
to
-
morrow
:
<EOS>
I
'm
sleepy
.
  
<EOS>
25
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
with
the
Secretary
this
morning
,
<EOS>
who
was
in
a
mighty
hurry
,
and
went
to
Windsor
in
a
chariot
with
Lord
Keeper
;
so
I
was
not
invited
,
and
am
forced
to
stay
at
home
,
but
not
at
all
against
my
will
;
for
I
could
have
gone
,
and
would
not
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
in
the
City
with
one
of
my
printers
,
for
whom
I
got
the
Gazette
,
and
am
come
home
early
;
and
have
nothing
to
say
to
you
more
,
but
finish
this
letter
,
and
not
send
it
by
the
bellman
.
 
<EOS>
Days
grow
short
,
and
the
weather
grows
bad
,
and
the
town
is
splenetic
,
and
things
are
so
oddly
contrived
that
I
can
not
be
absent
;
otherwise
I
would
go
for
a
few
days
to
Oxford
,
as
I
promised
.
 
<EOS>
They
say
it
is
certain
that
Prior
has
been
in
France
<EOS>
,
nobody
doubts
it
:
 
<EOS>
I
had
not
time
to
ask
the
Secretary
,
he
was
in
such
haste
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
I
will
take
my
leave
of
dearest
MD
for
a
while
;
for
I
must
begin
my
next
letter
to
-
night
:
 
<EOS>
consider
that
,
young
women
;
and
pray
be
merry
,
and
good
girls
,
and
love
Presto
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
now
but
one
business
the
Ministry
want
me
for
,
and
when
that
is
done
,
I
will
take
my
leave
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
got
a
penny
from
them
,
nor
expect
it
.
 
<EOS>
In
my
opinion
,
some
things
stand
very
ticklish
;
I
dare
say
nothing
at
this
distance
.
 
<EOS>
Farewell
,
dear
sirrahs
,
dearest
lives
:
 
<EOS>
there
is
peace
and
quiet
with
MD
,
and
nowhere
else
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
not
leisure
here
to
think
of
small
things
,
which
may
ruin
them
;
and
I
have
been
forward
enough
.
 
<EOS>
Farewell
again
<EOS>
,
dearest
rogues
;
I
am
never
happy
<EOS>
but
when
I
write
or
think
of
MD
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
enough
of
Courts
and
Ministries
,
and
wish
I
were
at
Laracor
;
and
if
I
could
with
honour
come
away
this
moment
,
I
would
.
<EOS>
Bernage
came
to
see
me
to
-
day
;
he
is
just
landed
from
Portugal
,
and
come
to
raise
recruits
;
he
looks
very
well
,
and
seems
pleased
with
his
station
and
manner
of
life
.
 
<EOS>
He
never
saw
London
nor
England
before
;
he
is
ravished
with
Kent
,
which
was
his
first
prospect
when
he
landed
.
 
<EOS>
Farewell
again
,
etc

LETTER
29
.
 
<EOS>
LONDON
,
Aug.
25
,
1711
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
got
a
pretty
small
gilt
sheet
of
paper
,
to
write
to
MD
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
this
moment
sent
my
28th
by
Patrick
,
who
tells
me
he
has
put
it
in
the
post
-
office
;
'
tis
directed
to
your
lodgings
:
 
if
it
wants
more
particular
direction
,
you
must
set
me
right
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
now
a
solar
month
and
two
days
since
the
date
of
your
last
,
N.18
;
and
I
reckon
you
are
now
quiet
at
home
,
and
thinking
to
begin
your
19th
,
which
will
be
full
of
your
quarrel
between
the
two
Houses
,
all
which
I
know
already
.
 
<EOS>
Where
shall
I
dine
to
-
morrow
?
<EOS>
can
you
tell
?
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Vanhomrigh
boards
now
,
and
can
not
invite
one
;
and
there
I
used
to
dine
when
I
was
at
a
loss
:
 
and
all
my
friends
are
gone
out
of
town
,
and
your
town
is
now
at
the
fullest
,
with
your
Parliament
and
Convocation
.
 
<EOS>
But
let
me
alone
,
sirrahs
;
for
Presto
is
going
to
be
very
busy
;
not
Presto
,
but
the
other
I.
  
26
.
 
<EOS>
People
have
so
left
the
town
that
I
am
at
a
loss
for
a
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
a
long
time
since
I
have
been
at
London
upon
a
Sunday
;
and
the
Ministers
are
all
at
Windsor
.
 
<EOS>
It
cost
me
eighteenpence
in
coach
-
hire
before
I
could
find
a
place
to
dine
in
.
 
<EOS>
I
went
to
Frankland
's
,
and
he
was
abroad
,
and
the
drab
his
wife
looked
out
at
window
,
and
bowed
to
me
without
inviting
me
up
:
 
<EOS>
so
I
dined
with
Mr.
Coote
,
my
Lord
Mountrath
's
brother
;
my
lord
is
with
you
in
Ireland
.
 
<EOS>
This
morning
at
five
my
Lord
Jersey
died
of
the
gout
in
his
stomach
,
or
apoplexy
,
or
both
:
 
<EOS>
he
was
abroad
yesterday
,
and
his
death
was
sudden
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
Chamberlain
to
King
William
,
and
a
great
favourite
,
turned
out
by
the
Queen
as
a
Tory
,
and
stood
now
fair
to
be
Privy
Seal
;
and
by
his
death
will
,
I
suppose
,
make
that
matter
easier
,
which
has
been
a
very
stubborn
business
at
Court
,
as
I
have
been
informed
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
remember
so
many
people
of
quality
to
have
died
in
so
short
a
time
.
  
<EOS>
27
.
 
<EOS>
I
went
to
-
day
into
the
City
,
to
thank
Stratford
for
my
books
,
and
dine
with
him
,
and
settle
my
affairs
of
my
money
in
the
Bank
,
and
receive
a
bill
for
Mrs.
Wesley
for
some
things
I
am
to
buy
for
her
;
and
the
d
#
#
#
#
a
one
of
all
these
could
I
do
.
 
<EOS>
The
merchants
were
all
out
of
town
,
and
I
was
forced
to
go
to
a
little
hedge
place
for
my
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
May
my
enemies
live
here
in
summer
!
<EOS>
and
yet
I
am
so
unlucky
that
I
can
not
possibly
be
out
of
the
way
at
this
juncture
.
 
<EOS>
People
leave
the
town
so
late
in
summer
,
and
return
so
late
in
winter
,
that
they
have
almost
inverted
the
seasons
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
autumn
<EOS>
this
good
while
in
St.
James
's
Park
;
the
limes
have
been
losing
their
leaves
,
and
those
remaining
on
the
trees
are
all
parched
:
 
<EOS>
I
hate
this
season
,
where
everything
grows
worse
and
worse
.
 
<EOS>
The
only
good
thing
of
it
is
the
fruit
,
and
that
I
dare
not
eat
.
 
<EOS>
Had
you
any
fruit
at
Wexford
?
 
<EOS>
A
few
cherries
,
and
durst
not
eat
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
hear
we
have
yet
got
a
new
Privy
Seal
.
 
<EOS>
The
Whigs
whisper
that
our
new
Ministry
differ
among
themselves
,
and
they
begin
to
talk
out
Mr.
Secretary
:
 
<EOS>
they
have
some
reasons
for
their
whispers
,
although
I
thought
it
was
a
greater
secret
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
much
like
the
posture
of
things
;
I
always
apprehended
that
any
falling
out
would
ruin
them
,
and
so
I
have
told
them
several
times
.
 
<EOS>
The
Whigs
are
mighty
full
of
hopes
at
present
;
and
whatever
is
the
matter
,
all
kind
of
stocks
fall
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
yet
talked
with
the
Secretary
about
Prior
's
journey
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
be
apt
to
think
it
may
foretell
a
peace
,
and
that
is
all
we
have
to
preserve
us
.
 
<EOS>
The
Secretary
is
not
come
from
Windsor
,
but
I
expect
him
to
-
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
Burn
all
politics
!
  
<EOS>
28
.
 
<EOS>
We
begin
to
have
fine
weather
,
and
I
walked
to
-
day
to
Chelsea
,
and
dined
with
the
Dean
of
Carlisle
,
who
is
laid
up
with
the
gout
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
now
fixed
that
he
is
to
be
Dean
of
Christ
Church
in
Oxford
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
advising
him
to
use
his
interest
to
prevent
any
misunderstanding
between
our
Ministers
;
but
he
is
too
wise
to
meddle
,
though
he
fears
the
thing
and
the
consequences
as
much
as
I.
He
will
get
into
his
own
warm
,
quiet
deanery
,
and
leave
them
to
themselves
;
and
he
is
in
the
right
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
came
home
to
-
night
,
I
found
a
letter
from
Mr.
Lewis
,
who
is
now
at
Windsor
;
and
in
it
,
forsooth
,
another
which
looked
like
Presto
's
hand
;
and
what
should
it
be
but
a
19th
from
MD
?
 
<EOS>
O
,
faith
<EOS>
,
I
"
scaped
narrowly
,
for
I
sent
my
28th
but
on
Saturday
;
and
what
should
I
have
done
if
I
had
two
letters
to
answer
at
once
?
 
<EOS>
I
did
not
expect
another
from
Wexford
,
that
is
certain
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
I
must
be
contented
;
but
you
are
dear
saucy
girls
,
for
all
that
,
to
write
so
soon
again
,
faith
;
an't
you
?
  
<EOS>
29
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
to
-
day
with
Lord
Abercorn
,
and
took
my
leave
of
them
:
 
<EOS>
they
set
out
to
-
morrow
for
Chester
,
and
,
I
believe
,
will
now
fix
in
Ireland
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
made
a
pretty
good
journey
of
it
:
 
his
eldest
son
is
married
to
a
lady
with
ten
thousand
pounds
;
and
his
second
son
has
,
t'other
day
,
got
a
prize
in
the
lottery
of
four
thousand
pounds
,
beside
two
small
ones
of
two
hundred
pounds
each
:
 
<EOS>
nay
,
the
family
was
so
fortunate
,
that
my
lord
bestowing
one
ticket
,
which
is
a
hundred
pounds
,
to
one
of
his
servants
,
who
had
been
his
page
,
the
young
fellow
got
a
prize
,
which
has
made
it
another
hundred
.
 
<EOS>
I
went
in
the
evening
to
Lord
Treasurer
,
who
desires
I
will
dine
with
him
to
-
morrow
,
when
he
will
show
me
the
answer
he
designs
to
return
to
the
letter
of
thanks
from
your
bishops
in
Ireland
.
 
<EOS>
The
Archbishop
of
Dublin
desired
me
to
get
myself
mentioned
in
the
answer
which
my
lord
would
send
;
but
I
sent
him
word
I
would
not
open
my
lips
to
my
lord
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
says
it
would
convince
the
bishops
of
what
I
have
affirmed
,
that
the
First
-
Fruits
were
granted
before
the
Duke
of
Ormond
was
declared
Governor
;
and
I
writ
to
him
that
I
would
not
give
a
farthing
to
convince
them
.
 
<EOS>
My
Lord
Treasurer
began
a
health
to
my
Lord
Privy
Seal
:
 
Prior
punned
,
and
said
it
was
so
privy
,
he
knew
not
who
it
was
;
but
I
fancy
they
have
fixed
it
all
,
and
we
shall
know
to
-
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
But
what
care
you
who
is
Privy
Seal
,
saucy
sluttikins
?
  
<EOS>
30
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
went
out
this
morning
,
I
was
surprised
with
the
news
that
the
Bishop
of
Bristol
is
made
Lord
Privy
Seal
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
his
name
is
Robinson
,
and
that
he
was
many
years
Envoy
in
Sweden
.
 
<EOS>
All
the
friends
of
the
present
Ministry
are
extremely
glad
,
and
the
clergy
above
the
rest
.
 
<EOS>
The
Whigs
will
fret
to
death
to
see
a
civil
employment
given
to
a
clergyman
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
very
handsome
thing
in
my
Lord
Treasurer
,
and
will
bind
the
Church
to
him
for
ever
.
<EOS>
I
dined
with
him
to
-
day
,
but
he
had
not
written
his
letter;[see
above
,
29th
Aug.
]
but
told
me
he
would
not
offer
to
send
it
without
showing
it
to
me
:
 
<EOS>
he
thought
that
would
not
be
just
,
since
I
was
so
deeply
concerned
in
the
affair
.
<EOS>
We
had
much
company
:
 
Lord
Rivers
,
Mar
,
and
Kinnoull
,
Mr.
Secretary
,
George
Granville
,
and
Masham
:
 
the
last
has
invited
me
to
the
christening
of
his
son
to
-
morrow
se'ennight
;
and
on
Saturday
I
go
to
Windsor
with
Mr.
Secretary
.
  
<EOS>
31
.
 
<EOS>
Dilly
<EOS>
and
I
walked
to
-
day
to
Kensington
to
Lady
Mountjoy
,
who
invited
us
to
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
He
returned
soon
,
to
go
to
a
play
,
it
being
the
last
that
will
be
acted
for
some
time
:
 
<EOS>
he
dresses
himself
like
a
beau
,
and
no
doubt
makes
a
fine
figure
.
 
<EOS>
I
went
to
visit
some
people
at
Kensington
:
 
<EOS>
Ophy
Butler
's
wife
there
lies
very
ill
of
an
ague
,
which
is
a
very
common
disease
here
,
and
little
known
in
Ireland
.
<EOS>
I
am
apt
to
think
we
shall
soon
have
a
peace
,
by
the
little
words
I
hear
thrown
out
by
the
Ministry
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
just
thought
of
a
project
to
bite
the
town
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
told
you
that
it
is
now
known
that
Mr.
Prior
has
been
lately
in
France
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
make
a
printer
of
my
own
sit
by
me
one
day
,
and
I
will
dictate
to
him
a
formal
relation
of
Prior
's
journey
,
with
several
particulars
,
all
pure
invention
;
and
I
doubt
not
but
it
will
take
.
  
<EOS>
Sept.
1
.
 
<EOS>
Morning
.
 
<EOS>
I
go
to
-
day
to
Windsor
with
Mr.
Secretary
;
and
Lord
Treasurer
has
promised
to
bring
me
back
.
 
<EOS>
The
weather
has
been
fine
for
some
time
,
and
I
believe
we
shall
have
a
great
deal
of
dust
.
 
<EOS>
At
night
.
 
<EOS>
Windsor
.
<EOS>
The
Secretary
and
I
dined
to
-
day
at
Parson
's
Green
,
at
my
Lord
Peterborow
's
house
,
who
has
left
it
and
his
gardens
to
the
Secretary
during
his
absence
.
<EOS>
It
is
the
finest
garden
I
have
ever
seen
about
this
town
;
and
abundance
of
hot
walls
for
grapes
,
where
they
are
in
great
plenty
,
and
ripening
fast
.
 
<EOS>
I
durst
not
eat
any
fruit
but
one
fig
;
but
I
brought
a
basket
full
to
my
friend
Lewis
here
at
Windsor
.
 
<EOS>
Does
Stella
never
eat
any
?
<EOS>
what
,
no
apricots
at
Donnybrook
!
<EOS>
nothing
but
claret
and
ombre
!
 
<EOS>
I
envy
people
maunching
and
maunching
peaches
and
grapes
,
and
I
not
daring
to
eat
a
bit
.
 
<EOS>
My
head
is
pretty
well
,
<EOS>
only
a
sudden
turn
any
time
makes
me
giddy
for
a
moment
,
and
sometimes
it
feels
very
stuffed
;
but
if
it
grows
no
worse
,
I
can
bear
it
very
well
.
 
<EOS>
I
take
all
opportunities
of
walking
;
and
we
have
a
delicious
park
here
just
joining
to
the
Castle
,
and
an
avenue
in
the
great
park
very
wide
and
two
miles
long
,
set
with
a
double
row
of
elms
on
each
side
.
 
<EOS>
Were
you
ever
at
Windsor
?
 
<EOS>
I
was
once
,
a
great
while
ago
;
but
had
quite
forgotten
it
.
  
<EOS>
2
.
 
<EOS>
The
Queen
has
the
gout
,
and
did
not
come
to
chapel
,
nor
stir
out
from
her
chamber
,
but
received
the
sacrament
there
,
as
she
always
does
the
first
Sunday
in
the
month
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
we
had
a
great
Court
;
and
,
among
others
,
I
saw
your
Ingoldsby
,
who
,
seeing
me
talk
very
familiarly
with
the
Keeper
,
Treasurer
,
etc
.
,
came
up
and
saluted
me
,
and
began
a
very
impertinent
discourse
about
the
siege
of
Bouchain
.
 
<EOS>
I
told
him
I
could
not
answer
his
questions
,
but
I
would
bring
him
one
that
should
;
so
I
went
and
fetched
Sutton
(
who
brought
over
the
express
about
a
month
ago
)
,
and
delivered
him
to
the
General
,
and
bid
him
answer
his
questions
;
and
<EOS>
so
I
left
them
together
.
 
<EOS>
Sutton
after
some
time
comes
back
in
a
rage
,
finds
me
with
Lord
Rivers
and
Masham
,
and
there
complains
of
the
trick
I
had
played
him
,
and
swore
he
had
been
plagued
to
death
with
Ingoldsby
's
talk
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
told
me
Ingoldsby
asked
him
what
I
meant
by
bringing
him
;
so
,
I
suppose
,
he
smoked
me
a
little
.
 
<EOS>
So
we
laughed
,
etc
.
<EOS>
My
Lord
Willoughby
,
who
is
one
of
the
chaplains
,
and
Prebendary
of
Windsor
,
read
prayers
last
night
to
the
family
;
and
the
Bishop
of
Bristol
,
who
is
Dean
of
Windsor
,
officiated
last
night
at
the
Cathedral
.
 
<EOS>
This
they
do
to
be
popular
;
and
it
pleases
mightily
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
with
Mr.
Masham
,
because
he
lets
me
have
a
select
company
:
 
for
the
Court
here
<EOS>
have
got
by
the
end
a
good
thing
I
said
to
the
Secretary
some
weeks
ago
.
 
<EOS>
He
showed
me
his
bill
of
fare
,
to
tempt
me
to
dine
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Poh
,
"
said
I
,
"
I
value
not
your
bill
of
fare
;
give
me
your
bill
of
company
.
"
 
<EOS>
Lord
Treasurer
was
mightily
pleased
,
and
told
it
everybody
as
a
notable
thing
.
 
<EOS>
I
reckon
upon
returning
to
-
morrow
:
 
<EOS>
they
say
the
Bishop
will
then
have
the
Privy
Seal
delivered
him
at
a
great
Council
.
  
<EOS>
3
.
 
Windsor
still
.
 
<EOS>
The
Council
was
held
so
late
to
-
day
that
I
do
not
go
back
to
town
till
to
-
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
The
Bishop
was
sworn
Privy
Councillor
,
and
had
the
Privy
Seal
given
him
:
 
and
now
the
patents
are
passed
for
those
who
were
this
long
time
to
be
made
lords
or
earls
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Raby
,
who
is
Earl
of
Strafford
,
is
on
Thursday
to
marry
a
namesake
of
Stella
's
;
the
daughter
of
Sir
H.
Johnson
in
the
City
;
he
has
three
-
score
thousand
pounds
with
her
,
ready
money
;
besides
the
rest
at
the
father
's
death
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
got
my
friend
Stratford
to
be
one
of
the
directors
of
the
South
Sea
Company
,
who
were
named
to
-
day
.
 
<EOS>
My
Lord
Treasurer
did
it
for
me
a
month
ago
;
and
one
of
those
whom
I
got
to
be
printer
of
the
Gazette
I
am
recommending
to
be
printer
to
the
same
company
.
 
<EOS>
He
treated
Mr.
Lewis
and
me
to
-
day
at
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
I
supped
last
night
and
this
with
Lord
Treasurer
,
Keeper
,
etc
.
,
and
took
occasion
to
mention
the
printer
.
 
<EOS>
I
said
it
was
the
same
printer
whom
my
Lord
Treasurer
has
appointed
to
print
for
the
South
Sea
Company
.
 
<EOS>
He
denied
,
and
I
insisted
on
it
;
and
I
got
the
laugh
on
my
side
.
  
<EOS>
London
,
4
.
 
<EOS>
I
came
as
far
as
Brentford
in
Lord
Rivers
's
chariot
,
who
had
business
with
Lord
Treasurer
;
then
I
went
into
Lord
Treasurer
's
.
 
<EOS>
We
stopped
at
Kensington
,
where
Lord
Treasurer
went
to
see
Mrs.
Masham
,
who
is
now
what
they
call
in
the
straw
.
 
<EOS>
We
got
to
town
by
three
,
and
I
lighted
at
Lord
Treasurer
's
,
who
commanded
me
not
to
stir
:
 
<EOS>
but
I
was
not
well
;
and
when
he
went
up
,
I
begged
the
young
lord
to
excuse
me
,
and
so
went
into
the
City
by
water
,
where
I
could
be
easier
,
and
dined
with
the
printer
,
and
dictated
to
him
some
part
of
Prior
's
Journey
to
France
.
 
<EOS>
I
walked
from
the
City
,
for
I
take
all
occasions
of
exercise
.
 
<EOS>
Our
journey
was
horridly
dusty
.
  
<EOS>
5
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
went
out
to
-
day
,
I
found
it
had
rained
mightily
in
the
night
,
and
the
streets
were
as
dirty
as
winter
:
 
<EOS>
it
is
very
refreshing
after
ten
days
dry
.
 
<EOS>
I
went
into
the
City
,
and
dined
with
Stratford
,
thanked
him
for
his
books
,
gave
him
joy
of
his
being
director
,
of
which
he
had
the
first
notice
by
a
letter
from
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
ate
sturgeon
,
and
it
lies
on
my
stomach
.
 
<EOS>
I
almost
finished
Prior
's
Journey
at
the
printer
's
;
and
came
home
pretty
late
,
with
Patrick
at
my
heels
.
  
<EOS>
7
.
 
<EOS>
Morning
.
 
<EOS>
But
what
shall
we
do
about
this
letter
of
MD
's
,
N.19
?
 
<EOS>
Not
a
word
answered
yet
,
and
so
much
paper
spent
!
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
do
anything
in
it
,
sweethearts
,
till
night
.
 
<EOS>
At
night
.
 
<EOS>
O
Lord
,
O
Lord
!
<EOS>
the
greatest
disgrace
that
ever
was
has
happened
to
Presto
.
 
<EOS>
What
do
you
think
?
<EOS>
but
,
when
I
was
going
out
this
forenoon
a
letter
came
from
MD
,
N.20
,
dated
Dublin
.
 
<EOS>
O
dear
,
O
dear
!
 
<EOS>
O
sad
,
O
sad
!
 
<EOS>
Now
I
have
two
letters
together
to
answer
:
 
here
they
are
,
lying
together
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
will
only
answer
the
first
;
for
I
came
in
late
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
with
my
friend
Lewis
at
his
lodgings
,
and
walked
at
six
to
Kensington
to
Mrs.
Masham
's
son
's
christening
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
very
private
;
nobody
there
but
my
Lord
Treasurer
,
his
son
and
son
-
in
-
law
,
that
is
to
say
,
Lord
Harley
and
Lord
Dupplin
,
and
Lord
Rivers
and
I.
 
<EOS>
The
Dean
of
Rochester
christened
the
child
,
but
soon
went
away
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Treasurer
and
Lord
Rivers
were
godfathers
;
and
Mrs.
Hill
,
Mrs.
Masham
's
sister
,
godmother
.
 
<EOS>
The
child
roared
like
a
bull
,
and
I
gave
Mrs.
Masham
joy
of
it
;
and
she
charged
me
to
take
care
of
my
nephew
,
because
,
Mr.
Masham
being
a
brother
of
our
Society
,
his
son
,
you
know
,
is
consequently
a
nephew
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Masham
sat
up
dressed
in
bed
,
but
not
,
as
they
do
in
Ireland
,
with
all
smooth
about
her
,
as
if
she
was
cut
off
in
the
middle
;
for
you
might
see
the
counterpane
(
what
d'ye
call
it
?
)
<EOS>
rise
about
her
hips
and
body
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
another
name
of
the
counterpane
;
and
you
will
laugh
now
,
sirrahs
.
 
<EOS>
George
Granville
came
in
at
supper
,
and
we
stayed
till
eleven
;
and
Lord
Treasurer
set
me
down
at
my
lodging
in
Suffolk
Street
.
 
<EOS>
Did
I
ever
tell
you
that
Lord
Treasurer
hears
ill
with
the
left
ear
,
just
as
I
do
?
 
<EOS>
He
always
turns
the
right
,
and
his
servants
whisper
him
at
that
only
.
 
<EOS>
I
dare
not
tell
him
that
I
am
so
too
,
<EOS>
for
fear
he
should
think
I
counterfeited
,
to
make
my
court
.
  
<EOS>

.
 
<EOS>
You
must
read
this
before
the
other
;
for
I
mistook
,
and
forgot
to
write
yesterday
's
journal
,
it
was
so
insignificant
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
with
Dr.
Cockburn
,
and
sat
the
evening
with
Lord
Treasurer
till
ten
o'clock
.
 
<EOS>
On
Thursdays
he
has
always
a
large
select
company
,
and
expects
me
.
 
<EOS>
So
good
-
night
for
last
night
,
etc
.
  
<EOS>
8
.
 
<EOS>
Morning
.
 
<EOS>
I
go
to
Windsor
with
Lord
Treasurer
to
-
day
,
and
will
leave
this
behind
me
,
to
be
sent
to
the
post
.
 
<EOS>
And
now
let
us
hear
what
says
the
first
letter
,
N.19
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
still
at
Wexford
,
as
you
say
,
Madam
Dingley
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
no
letter
from
me
ever
yet
miscarried
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
Inish
-
Corthy
,
and
the
river
Slainy
<EOS>
;
fine
words
those
in
a
lady
's
mouth
.
 
<EOS>
Your
hand
like
Dingley
's
<EOS>
,
you
scambling
,
scattering
sluttikin
!
 
<EOS>
YES
,
MIGHTY
LIKE
INDEED
,
IS
NOT
IT
?
<EOS>
Pisshh
,
do
not
talk
of
writing
or
reading
till
your
eyes
are
well
,
and
long
well
;
only
I
would
have
Dingley
read
sometimes
to
you
,
that
you
may
not
lose
the
desire
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
God
be
thanked
,
that
the
ugly
numbing
is
gone
!
 
<EOS>
Pray
use
exercise
when
you
go
to
town
.
 
<EOS>
What
game
is
that
ombra
which
Dr.
Elwood
and
you
play
at
?
<EOS>
is
it
the
Spanish
game
ombre
?
 
<EOS>
Your
card
-
purse
?
<EOS>
you
a
card
-
purse
!
<EOS>
you
a
fiddlestick
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
luck
indeed
;
and
luck
in
a
bag
.
 
<EOS>
What
a
devil
!
<EOS>
is
that
eight
-
shilling
tea
-
kettle
copper
,
or
tin
japanned
?
 
<EOS>
It
is
like
your
Irish
politeness
,
raffling
for
tea
-
kettles
.
 
<EOS>
What
a
splutter
you
keep
,
to
convince
me
that
Walls
has
no
taste
!
 
<EOS>
My
head
continues
pretty
well
.
 
<EOS>
Why
do
you
write
,
dear
sirrah
<EOS>
Stella
,
when
you
find
your
eyes
so
weak
that
you
can
not
see
?
<EOS>
what
comfort
is
there
in
reading
what
you
write
,
when
one
knows
that
?
 
<EOS>
So
Dingley
can
not
write
,
because
of
the
clutter
of
new
company
come
to
Wexford
!
<EOS>
I
suppose
the
noise
of
their
hundred
horses
disturbs
you
;
or
do
you
lie
in
one
gallery
,
as
in
an
hospital
?
 
<EOS>
What
!
<EOS>
you
are
afraid
of
losing
in
Dublin
the
acquaintance
you
have
got
in
Wexford
,
and
chiefly
the
Bishop
of
Raphoe
,
an
old
,
doting
,
perverse
coxcomb
?
 
<EOS>
Twenty
at
a
time
at
breakfast
.
 
<EOS>
That
is
like
five
pounds
at
a
time
,
when
it
was
never
but
once
.
 
<EOS>
I
doubt
,
Madam
Dingley
,
you
are
apt
to
lie
in
your
travels
,
though
not
so
bad
as
Stella
;
she
tells
thumpers
,
as
I
shall
prove
in
my
next
,
if
I
find
this
receives
encouragement
.
 
<EOS>
So
Dr.
Elwood
says
there
are
a
world
of
pretty
things
in
my
works
.
 
<EOS>
A
pox
on
his
praises
!
<EOS>
an
enemy
here
would
say
more
.
 
<EOS>
The
Duke
of
Buckingham
would
say
as
much
,
though
he
and
I
are
terribly
fallen
out
;
and
the
great
men
are
perpetually
inflaming
me
against
him
:
 
<EOS>
they
bring
me
all
he
says
of
me
,
and
,
I
believe
,
make
it
worse
out
of
roguery
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
'
tis
<EOS>
not
your
pen
is
bewitched
,
Madam
Stella
,
but
your
old
SCRAWLING
,
SPLAY
-
FOOT
POT
-
HOOKS
,
S
,
S
,
ay
<EOS>
that
's
it
:
 
there
<EOS>
the

s
,
there
,
there
,
that
's
exact

<EOS>
Farewell
,
etc
.
  
<EOS>
Our
fine
weather
is
gone
;
and
I
doubt
we
shall
have
a
rainy
journey
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
Faith
,
'
tis
shaving
-
day
,
and
I
have
much
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
When
Stella
says
her
pen
was
bewitched
,
it
was
only
because
there
was
a
hair
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
,
the
fellow
they
call
God
-
help
-
it
had
the
same
thoughts
of
his
wife
,
and
for
the
same
reason
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
this
is
very
well
observed
,
and
I
unfolded
the
letter
to
tell
you
it
.
  
<EOS>
Cut
off
those
two
notes
above
;
and
see
the
nine
pounds
indorsed
,
and
receive
the
other
;
and
send
me
word
how
my
accounts
stand
,
that
they
may
be
adjusted
by
Nov.
1
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
be
very
particular
;
but
the
twenty
pounds
I
lend
you
is
not
to
be
included
:
 
so
make
no
blunder
.
 
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
wrong
you
,
nor
you
sha
n't
wrong
me
;
that
is
the
short
.
 
<EOS>
O
Lord
,
how
stout
Presto
is
of
late
!
 
<EOS>
But
he
loves
MD
more
than
his
life
a
thousand
times
,
for
all
his
stoutness
;
tell
them
that
;
and
that
I
'll
swear
it
,
as
hope
saved
,
ten
millions
of
times
,
etc
.
<EOS>
etc
.
  
<EOS>
I
open
my
letter
once
more
,
to
tell
Stella
that
if
she
does
not
use
exercise
after
her
waters
,
it
will
lose
all
the
effects
of
them
:
 
I
should
not
live
if
I
did
not
take
all
opportunities
of
walking
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
,
pray
,
do
this
,
to
oblige
poor
Presto

LETTER
30
.
 
<EOS>
WINDSOR
,
Sept.
8
,
1711
.
  
<EOS>
I
made
the
coachman
stop
,
and
put
in
my
twenty
-
ninth
at
the
post
-
office
at
two
o'clock
to
-
day
,
as
I
was
going
to
Lord
Treasurer
,
with
whom
I
dined
,
and
came
here
by
a
quarter
-
past
eight
;
but
the
moon
shone
,
and
so
we
were
not
in
much
danger
of
overturning
;
which
,
however
,
he
values
not
a
straw
,
and
only
laughs
when
I
chide
at
him
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
nobody
but
he
and
I
,
and
we
supped
together
,
with
Mr.
Masham
,
and
Dr.
Arbuthnot
,
the
Queen
's
favourite
physician
,
a
Scotchman
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
keep
myself
awake
after
supper
,
but
did
all
I
was
able
to
disguise
it
,
and
thought
I
came
off
clear
;
but
,
at
parting
,
he
told
me
I
had
got
my
nap
already
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
now
one
o'clock
;
but
he
loves
sitting
up
late
.
  
<EOS>

.
 
<EOS>
The
Queen
is
still
in
the
gout
,
but
recovering
:
 
<EOS>
she
saw
company
in
her
bed
-
chamber
after
church
;
but
the
crowd
was
so
great
,
I
could
not
see
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
with
my
brother
Sir
William
Wyndham
,
and
some
others
of
our
Society
,
to
avoid
the
great
tables
on
Sunday
at
Windsor
,
which
I
hate
.
 
<EOS>
The
usual
company
supped
to
-
night
at
Lord
Treasurer
's
,
which
was
Lord
Keeper
,
Mr.
Secretary
,
George
Granville
,
Masham
,
Arbuthnot
,
and
I.
 
<EOS>
But
showers
have
hindered
me
from
walking
to
-
day
,
and
that
I
do
not
love
.
 
<EOS>
Noble
fruit
,
and
I
dare
not
eat
a
bit
.
 
<EOS>
I
ate
one
fig
to
-
day
,
and
sometimes
a
few
mulberries
,
because
it
is
said
they
are
wholesome
,
and
you
know
a
good
name
does
much
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
return
to
town
to
-
morrow
,
though
I
thought
to
have
stayed
a
week
,
to
be
at
leisure
for
something
I
am
doing
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
have
put
it
off
till
next
;
for
I
shall
come
here
again
on
Saturday
,
when
our
Society
are
to
meet
at
supper
at
Mr.
Secretary
's
.
 
<EOS>
My
life
is
very
regular
here
:
 
on
Sunday
morning
I
constantly
visit
Lord
Keeper
,
and
sup
at
Lord
Treasurer
's
with
the
same
set
of
company
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
not
sleepy
to
-
night
;
I
resolved
I
would
not
;
yet
it
is
past
midnight
at
this
present
writing
.
  
<EOS>
London
,
10
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Treasurer
and
Masham
and
I
left
Windsor
at
three
this
afternoon
:
 
we
dropped
Masham
at
Kensington
with
his
lady
,
and
got
home
by
six
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
seven
before
we
sat
down
to
dinner
,
and
I
stayed
till
past
eleven
.
 
<EOS>
Patrick
came
home
with
the
Secretary
:
 
<EOS>
I
am
more
plagued
with
Patrick
and
my
portmantua
than
with
myself
.
 
<EOS>
I
forgot
to
tell
you
that
when
I
went
to
Windsor
on
Saturday
I
overtook
Lady
Giffard
and
Mrs.
Fenton
in
a
chariot
,
going
,
I
suppose
,
to
Sheen
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
then
in
a
chariot
too
,
of
Lord
Treasurer
's
brother
,
who
had
business
with
the
Treasurer
;
and
my
lord
came
after
,
and
overtook
me
at
Turnham
Green
,
four
miles
from
London
;
and
then
the
brother
went
back
,
and
I
went
in
the
coach
with
Lord
Treasurer
:
 
<EOS>
so
it
happened
that
those
people
saw
me
,
and
not
with
Lord
Treasurer
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
F.
was
to
see
me
about
a
week
ago
;
and
desired
I
would
get
her
son
into
the
Charter
-
house
.
  
<EOS>
11
.
 
<EOS>
This
morning
the
printer
sent
me
an
account
of
Prior
's
Journey
;
it
makes
a
twopenny
pamphlet
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
you
will
see
it
,
for
I
dare
engage
it
will
run
;
'
tis
a
formal
,
grave
lie
,
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
.
 
<EOS>
I
writ
all
but
about
the
last
page
;
that
I
dictated
,
and
the
printer
writ
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Secretary
sent
to
me
to
dine
where
he
did
;
it
was
at
Prior
's
:
 
when
I
came
in
,
Prior
showed
me
the
pamphlet
,
seemed
to
be
angry
,
and
said
,
"
Here
is
our
English
liberty
!
"
 
<EOS>
I
read
some
of
it
,
and
said
I
liked
it
mightily
,
and
envied
the
rogue
the
thought
;
for
,
had
it
come
into
my
head
,
I
should
have
certainly
done
it
myself
.
 
<EOS>
We
stayed
at
Prior
's
till
past
ten
;
and
then
the
Secretary
received
a
packet
with
the
news
of
Bouchain
being
taken
,
for
which
the
guns
will
go
off
to
-
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
Prior
owned
his
having
been
in
France
,
for
it
was
past
denying
:
 
<EOS>
it
seems
he
was
discovered
by
a
rascal
at
Dover
,
who
had
positive
orders
to
let
him
pass
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
we
shall
have
a
peace
.
  
<EOS>
12
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
terrible
rainy
weather
,
and
has
cost
me
three
shillings
in
coaches
and
chairs
to
-
day
,
yet
I
was
dirty
into
the
bargain
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
three
hours
this
morning
with
the
Secretary
about
some
business
of
moment
,
and
then
went
into
the
City
to
dine
.
 
<EOS>
The
printer
tells
me
he
sold
yesterday
a
thousand
of
Prior
's
Journey
,
and
had
printed
five
hundred
more
.
 
<EOS>
It
will
do
rarely
,
I
believe
,
and
is
a
pure
bite
.
 
<EOS>
And
what
is
MD
doing
all
this
while
?
<EOS>
got
again
to
their
cards
,
their
Walls
,
their
deans
,
their
Stoytes
,
and
their
claret
?
<EOS>
Pray
present
my
service
to
Mr.
Stoyte
and
Catherine
.
 
<EOS>
Tell
Goody
Stoyte
<EOS>
she
owes
me
a
world
of
dinners
,
and
I
will
shortly
come
over
and
demand
them
.
 
<EOS>
Did
I
tell
you
of
the
Archbishop
of
Dublin
's
last
letter
?
 
<EOS>
He
had
been
saying
,
in
several
of
his
former
,
that
he
would
shortly
write
to
me
something
about
myself
;
and
it
looked
as
if
he
intended
something
for
me
:
 
at
last
out
<EOS>
it
comes
,
and
consists
of
two
parts
.
 
<EOS>
First
,
he
advises
me
to
strike
in
for
some
preferment
now
<EOS>
I
have
friends
;
and
secondly
,
he
advises
me
,
since
I
have
parts
,
and
learning
,
and
a
happy
pen
,
to
think
of
some
new
subject
in
divinity
not
handled
by
others
,
which
I
should
manage
better
than
anybody
.
 
<EOS>
A
rare
spark
this
,
with
a
pox
!
<EOS>
but
I
shall
answer
him
as
rarely
.
 
<EOS>
Methinks
he
should
have
invited
me
over
,
and
given
me
some
hopes
or
promises
.
 
<EOS>
But
hang
him
!
<EOS>
and
so
good
-
night
,
etc
.
  
<EOS>
13
.
 
<EOS>
It
rained
most
furiously
all
this
morning
till
about
twelve
,
and
sometimes
thundered
;
I
trembled
for
my
shillings
,
but
it
cleared
up
,
and
I
made
a
shift
to
get
a
walk
in
the
Park
,
and
then
went
with
the
Secretary
to
dine
with
Lord
Treasurer
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
Thursdays
there
is
always
a
select
company
:
we
had
the
Duke
of
Shrewsbury
,
Lord
Rivers
,
the
two
Secretaries
,
Mr.
Granville
,
and
Mr.
Prior
.
 
<EOS>
Half
of
them
went
to
Council
at
six
;
but
Rivers
,
Granville
,
Prior
,
and
I
,
stayed
till
eight
.
 
<EOS>
Prior
was
often
affecting
to
be
angry
at
the
account
of
his
journey
to
Paris
;
and
indeed
the
two
last
pages
,
which
the
printer
got
somebody
to
add
,
are
so
romantic
,
they
spoil
all
the
rest
.
 
<EOS>
Dilly
Ashe
pretended
to
me
that
he
was
only
going
to
Oxford
and
Cambridge
for
a
fortnight
,
and
then
would
come
back
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
see
him
as
I
appointed
t'other
day
;
but
some
of
his
friends
tell
me
he
took
leave
of
them
as
going
to
Ireland
;
and
so
they
say
at
his
lodging
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
the
rogue
was
ashamed
to
tell
me
so
,
because
I
advised
him
to
stay
the
winter
,
and
he
said
he
would
.
 
<EOS>
I
find
he
had
got
into
a
good
set
of
scrub
acquaintance
,
and
I
thought
passed
his
time
very
merrily
;
but
I
suppose
he
languished
after
Balderig
,
and
the
claret
of
Dublin
;
and
,
after
all
,
I
think
he
is
in
the
right
;
for
he
can
eat
,
drink
,
and
converse
better
there
than
here
.
 
<EOS>
Bernage
was
with
me
this
morning
:
 
<EOS>
he
calls
now
and
then
;
he
is
in
terrible
fear
of
a
peace
.
 
<EOS>
He
said
he
never
had
his
health
so
well
as
in
Portugal
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
a
favourite
of
his
Colonel
.
  
<EOS>
14
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
mortified
enough
to
-
day
,
not
knowing
where
in
the
world
to
dine
<EOS>
,
the
town
is
so
empty
.
 
<EOS>
I
met
H.
Coote
,
and
thought
he
would
invite
me
,
but
he
did
not
:
 
<EOS>
Sir
John
Stanley
did
not
come
into
my
head
;
so
I
took
up
with
Mrs.
Van
,
and
dined
with
her
and
her
damned
landlady
,
who
,
I
believe
,
by
her
eyebrows
,
is
a
bawd
.
 
<EOS>
This
evening
I
met
Addison
and
Pastoral
Philips
in
the
Park
,
and
supped
with
them
at
Addison
's
lodgings
:
 
<EOS>
we
were
very
good
company
,
and
I
yet
know
no
man
half
so
agreeable
to
me
as
he
is
.
 
<EOS>
I
sat
with
them
till
twelve
,
so
you
may
think
it
is
late
,
young
women
;
however
,
I
would
have
some
little
conversation
with
MD
before
your
Presto
goes
to
bed
,
because
it
makes
me
sleep
,
and
dream
,
and
so
forth
.
 
<EOS>
Faith
,
this
letter
goes
on
slowly
enough
,
sirrahs
;
but
I
can
not
write
much
at
a
time
till
you
are
quite
settled
after
your
journey
,
you
know
,
and
have
gone
all
your
visits
,
and
lost
your
money
at
ombre
.
 
<EOS>
You
never
play
at
chess
now
,
Stella
.
 
<EOS>
That
puts
me
in
mind
of
Dick
Tighe
;
I
fancy
<EOS>
I
told
you
he
used
to
beat
his
wife
here
;
and
she
deserved
it
;
and
he
resolves
to
part
with
her
;
and
they
went
to
Ireland
in
different
coaches
.
 
<EOS>
O
Lord
,
I
said
all
this
before
,
I
am
sure
.
 
<EOS>
Go
to
bed
,
sirrahs
.
  
<EOS>
Windsor
,
15
.
 
<EOS>
I
made
the
Secretary
stop
at
Brentford
,
because
we
set
out
at
two
this
afternoon
,
and
fasting
would
not
agree
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
only
designed
to
eat
a
bit
of
bread
-
and
-
butter
;
but
he
would
light
,
and
we
ate
roast
beef
like
dragons
.
 
<EOS>
And
he
made
me
treat
him
and
two
more
gentlemen
;
faith
,
it
cost
me
a
guinea
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
like
such
jesting
,
yet
<EOS>
I
was
mightily
pleased
with
it
too
.
<EOS>
To
-
night
our
Society
met
at
the
Secretary
's
:
 
there
were
nine
of
us
;
and
we
have
chosen
a
new
member
,
the
Earl
of
Jersey
,
whose
father
died
lately
.
'
<EOS>
Tis
past
one
,
and
I
have
stolen
away
.
  
<EOS>
16
.
 
<EOS>
I
design
to
stay
here
this
week
by
myself
,
about
some
business
that
lies
on
my
hands
,
and
will
take
up
a
great
deal
of
time
.
 
<EOS>
Dr.
Adams
,
one
of
the
canons
,
invited
me
to
-
day
to
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
The
tables
are
so
full
here
on
Sunday
that
it
is
hard
to
dine
with
a
few
,
and
Dr.
Adams
knows
I
love
to
do
so
;
which
is
very
obliging
.
 
<EOS>
The
Queen
saw
company
in
her
bed
-
chamber
;
she
looks
very
well
,
but
she
sat
down
.
 
<EOS>
I
supped
with
Lord
Treasurer
as
usual
,
and
stayed
till
past
one
as
usual
,
and
with
our
usual
company
,
except
Lord
Keeper
,
who
did
not
come
this
time
to
Windsor
.
 
<EOS>
I
hate
these
suppers
mortally
,
but
I
seldom
eat
anything
.
  
<EOS>
17
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Treasurer
and
Mr.
Secretary
stay
here
till
tomorrow
;
some
business
keeps
them
,
and
I
am
sorry
for
it
,
for
they
hinder
me
a
day
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Lewis
and
I
were
going
to
dine
soberly
with
a
little
Court
friend
at
one
.
 
<EOS>
But
Lord
Harley
and
Lord
Dupplin
kept
me
by
force
,
and
said
we
should
dine
at
Lord
Treasurer
's
,
who
intended
to
go
at
four
to
London
.
 
<EOS>
I
stayed
like
a
fool
,
and
went
with
the
two
young
lords
to
Lord
Treasurer
,
who
very
fairly
turned
us
all
three
out
of
doors
.
 
<EOS>
They
both
were
invited
to
the
Duke
of
Somerset
,
but
he
was
gone
to
a
horse
-
race
,
and
would
not
come
till
five
;
so
we
were
forced
to
go
to
a
tavern
,
and
sent
for
wine
from
Lord
Treasurer
's
,
who
at
last
,
we
were
told
,
did
not
go
to
town
till
the
morrow
,
and
at
Lord
Treasurer
's
we
supped
again
;
and
I
desired
him
to
let
me
add
four
shillings
to
the
bill
I
gave
him
.
<EOS>
We
sat
up
till
two
,
yet
I
must
write
to
little
MD
.
  
<EOS>
18
.
 
<EOS>
They
are
all
gone
early
this
morning
,
and
I
am
alone
to
seek
my
fortune
;
but
Dr.
Arbuthnot
engages
me
for
my
dinners
;
and
he
yesterday
gave
me
my
choice
of
place
,
person
,
and
victuals
for
to
-
day
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
chose
to
dine
with
Mrs.
Hill
,
who
is
one
of
the
dressers
,
and
Mrs.
Masham
's
sister
,
no
company
but
us
three
,
and
to
have
a
shoulder
of
mutton
,
a
small
one
;
which
was
exactly
,
only
there
was
too
much
victuals
besides
;
and
the
Doctor
's
wife
was
of
the
company
.
 
<EOS>
And
to
-
morrow
Mrs.
Hill
and
<EOS>
I
are
to
dine
with
the
Doctor
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
seen
a
fellow
often
about
Court
whom
I
thought
I
knew
.
 
<EOS>
I
asked
who
he
was
,
and
they
told
me
it
was
the
gentleman
porter
;
then
I
called
him
to
mind
;
he
was
Killy
's
acquaintance
(
I
wo
n't
say
yours
)
;
I
think
his
name
is
Lovet
,
or
Lovel
,
or
something
like
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
he
does
not
know
me
,
and
in
my
present
posture
I
shall
not
be
fond
of
renewing
old
acquaintance
;
I
believe
I
used
to
see
him
with
the
Bradleys
;
and
,
by
the
way
,
I
have
not
seen
Mrs.
Bradley
since
I
came
to
England
.
 
<EOS>
I
left
your
letter
in
London
,
like
a
fool
;
and
can
not
answer
it
till
I
go
back
,
which
will
not
be
until
Monday
next
;
so
this
will
be
above
a
fortnight
from
my
last
;
but
I
will
fetch
it
up
in
my
next
;
so
go
and
walk
to
the
Dean
's
for
your
health
this
fine
weather
.
  
<EOS>
19
.
 
<EOS>
The
Queen
designs
to
have
cards
and
dancing
here
next
week
,
which
makes
us
think
she
will
stay
here
longer
than
we
believed
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Masham
is
not
well
after
her
lying
-
in
:
 
<EOS>
I
doubt
she
got
some
cold
;
she
is
lame
in
one
of
her
legs
with
a
rheumatic
pain
.
 
<EOS>
Dr.
Arbuthnot
and
Mrs.
Hill
go
tomorrow
to
Kensington
to
see
her
,
and
return
the
same
night
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Hill
and
I
dined
with
the
Doctor
to
-
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
rode
out
this
morning
with
the
Doctor
to
see
Cranburn
,
a
house
of
Lord
Ranelagh
's
,
and
the
Duchess
of
Marlborough
's
lodge
,
and
the
Park
;
the
finest
places
they
are
,
for
nature
and
plantations
,
that
ever
I
saw
;
and
the
finest
riding
upon
artificial
roads
,
made
on
purpose
for
the
Queen
.
 
<EOS>
Arbuthnot
made
me
draw
up
a
sham
subscription
for
a
book
,
called
A
History
of
the
Maids
of
Honour
since
Harry
the
Eighth
,
showing
they
make
the
best
wives
,
with
a
list
of
all
the
maids
of
honour
since
,
etc
.
;
to
pay
a
crown
in
hand
,
and
the
other
crown
upon
delivery
of
the
book
;
and
all
in
common
forms
of
those
things
.
 
<EOS>
We
got
a
gentleman
to
write
it
fair
,
because
my
hand
is
known
;
and
we
sent
it
to
the
maids
of
honour
,
when
they
came
to
supper
.
 
<EOS>
If
they
bite
at
it
,
it
will
be
a
very
good
Court
jest
;
and
the
Queen
will
certainly
have
it
:
 
<EOS>
we
did
not
tell
Mrs.
Hill
.
  
<EOS>
20
.
 
<EOS>
To
-
day
I
was
invited
to
the
Green
Cloth
by
Colonel
Godfrey
,
who
married
the
Duke
of
Marlborough
's
sister
,
mother
to
the
Duke
of
Berwick
by
King
James
:
 
<EOS>
I
must
tell
you
those
things
that
happened
before
you
were
born
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
made
my
excuses
,
and
young
Harcourt
<EOS>
(
Lord
Keeper
's
son
)
<EOS>
and
I
dined
with
my
next
neighbour
,
Dr
Adams
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Masham
is
better
,
and
will
be
here
in
three
or
four
days
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
need
;
for
the
Duchess
of
Somerset
is
thought
to
gain
ground
daily
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
not
sent
you
over
all
your
bills
;
and
I
think
we
have
altered
your
money
-
bill
.
 
<EOS>
The
Duke
of
Ormond
is
censured
here
,
by
those
in
power
,
for
very
wrong
management
in
the
affair
of
the
mayoralty
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
governed
by
fools
,
and
has
usually
much
more
sense
than
his
advisers
,
but
never
proceeds
by
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
know
how
your
health
continues
after
Wexford
.
<EOS>
Walk
and
use
exercise
,
sirrahs
both
;
and
get
somebody
to
play
at
shuttlecock
with
you
,
Madam
Stella
,
and
walk
to
the
Dean
's
and
Donnybrook
.
  
<EOS>
21
.
 
<EOS>
Colonel
Godfrey
sent
to
me
again
to
-
day
;
<EOS>
so
I
dined
at
the
Green
Cloth
,
and
we
had
but
eleven
at
dinner
,
which
is
a
small
number
there
,
<EOS>
the
Court
being
always
thin
of
company
till
Saturday
night
.
 
<EOS>
This
new
ink
and
pen
make
a
strange
figure
;
I
MUST
WRITE
LARGER
,
<EOS>
YES
<EOS>
I
MUST
,
<EOS>
OR
STELLA
WILL
NOT
BE
<EOS>
ABLE
<EOS>
TO
READ
THIS
.
 
<EOS>
S.
S.
S.
,
there
is
your
S
's
for
you
,
Stella
.
 
<EOS>
The
maids
of
honour
are
bit
,
and
have
all
contributed
their
crowns
,
and
are
teasing
others
to
subscribe
for
the
book
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
tell
Lord
Keeper
and
Lord
Treasurer
to
-
morrow
;
and
I
believe
the
Queen
will
have
it
.
 
<EOS>
After
a
little
walk
this
evening
,
I
squandered
away
the
rest
of
it
in
sitting
at
Lewis
's
lodging
,
while
he
and
Dr.
Arbuthnot
played
at
picquet
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
that
foolish
pleasure
,
which
I
believe
nobody
has
beside
me
,
except
old
Lady
Berkeley
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
fretted
when
I
came
away
:
 
I
will
loiter
<EOS>
so
no
more
,
for
I
have
a
plaguy
deal
of
business
upon
my
hands
,
and
very
little
time
to
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
The
pamphleteers
begin
to
be
very
busy
against
the
Ministry
:
 
I
have
begged
Mr.
Secretary
to
make
examples
of
one
or
two
of
them
,
and
he
assures
me
he
will
.
 
<EOS>
They
are
very
bold
and
abusive
.
  
<EOS>
22
.
 
<EOS>
This
being
the
day
the
Ministry
come
to
Windsor
,
I
ate
a
bit
or
two
at
Mr.
Lewis
's
lodgings
,
because
I
must
sup
with
Lord
Treasurer
;
and
at
half
an
hour
after
one
,
I
led
Mr.
Lewis
a
walk
up
the
avenue
,
which
is
two
miles
long
.
<EOS>
We
walked
in
all
about
five
miles
;
but
I
was
so
tired
with
his
slow
walking
,
that
I
left
him
here
,
and
walked
two
miles
towards
London
,
hoping
to
meet
Lord
Treasurer
,
and
return
with
him
;
but
it
grew
darkish
,
and
I
was
forced
to
walk
back
,
so
I
walked
nine
miles
in
all
;
and
Lord
Treasurer
did
not
come
till
after
eight
;
which
is
very
wrong
,
for
there
was
no
moon
,
and
I
often
tell
him
how
ill
he
does
to
expose
himself
so
;
but
he
only
makes
a
jest
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
supped
with
him
,
and
stayed
till
now
,
when
it
is
half
an
hour
after
two
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
as
merry
and
careless
and
disengaged
as
a
young
heir
at
one
-
and
-
twenty
.
'
<EOS>
Tis
late
indeed
.
  
<EOS>
23
.
 
<EOS>
The
Secretary
did
not
come
last
night
,
but
at
three
this
afternoon
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
seen
him
yet
,
but
I
verily
think
they
are
contriving
a
peace
as
fast
as
they
can
,
without
which
it
will
be
impossible
to
subsist
.
 
<EOS>
The
Queen
was
at
church
to
-
day
,
but
was
carried
in
a
chair
.
 
<EOS>
I
and
Mr.
Lewis
dined
privately
with
Mr.
Lowman
,
Clerk
of
the
Kitchen
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
to
see
Lord
Keeper
this
morning
,
and
told
him
the
jest
of
the
maids
of
honour
;
and
Lord
Treasurer
had
it
last
night
.
 
<EOS>
That
rogue
Arbuthnot
puts
it
all
upon
me
.
 
<EOS>
The
Court
was
very
full
to
-
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
expected
Lord
Treasurer
would
have
invited
me
to
supper
;
but
he
only
bowed
to
me
;
and
we
had
no
discourse
in
the
drawing
-
room
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
now
seven
at
night
,
and
I
am
at
home
;
and
I
hope
Lord
Treasurer
will
not
send
for
me
to
supper
:
 
if
he
does
not
,
I
will
reproach
him
;
and
he
will
pretend
to
chide
me
for
not
coming
.
 
<EOS>
So
farewell
<EOS>
till
I
go
to
bed
,
for
I
am
going
to
be
busy
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
now
past
ten
,
and
I
went
down
to
ask
the
servants
about
Mr.
Secretary
:
 
<EOS>
they
tell
me
the
Queen
is
yet
at
Council
,
and
that
she
went
to
supper
,
and
came
out
to
the
Council
afterwards
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
certain
they
are
managing
a
peace
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
go
to
bed
,
and
there
is
an
end
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
now
eleven
,
and
a
messenger
is
come
from
Lord
Treasurer
to
sup
with
them
;
but
I
have
excused
myself
,
and
am
glad
I
am
in
bed
;
for
else
I
should
sit
up
till
two
,
and
drink
till
I
was
hot
.
 
<EOS>
Now
I
'll
go
sleep
.
  
<EOS>
London
,
24
.
 
<EOS>
I
came
to
town
by
six
with
Lord
Treasurer
,
and
have
stayed
till
ten
.
 
<EOS>
That
of
the
Queen
's
going
out
to
sup
,
and
coming
in
again
,
is
a
lie
,
as
the
Secretary
told
me
this
morning
;
but
I
find
the
Ministry
are
very
busy
with
Mr.
Prior
,
and
I
believe
he
will
go
again
to
France
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
told
so
much
,
that
we
shall
certainly
have
a
peace
very
soon
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
charming
weather
all
last
week
at
Windsor
;
but
we
have
had
a
little
rain
to
-
day
,
and
yesterday
was
windy
.
 
<EOS>
Prior
's
Journey
sells
still
;
they
have
sold
two
thousand
,
although
the
town
is
empty
.
 
<EOS>
I
found
a
letter
from
Mrs.
Fenton
here
,
desiring
me
,
in
Lady
Giffard
's
name
,
to
come
and
pass
a
week
at
Sheen
,
while
she
is
at
Moor
Park
.
<EOS>
I
will
answer
it
with
a
vengeance
:
 
and
now
you
talk
of
answering
,
there
is
MD
's
N.20
<EOS>
is
yet
to
be
answered
:
 
<EOS>
I
had
put
it
up
so
safe
<EOS>
,
I
could
hardly
find
it
;
but
here
it
is
,
faith
,
and
I
am
afraid
I
can
not
send
this
till
Thursday
;
for
I
must
see
the
Secretary
to
-
morrow
morning
,
and
be
in
some
other
place
in
the
evening
.
  
<EOS>
25
.
 
<EOS>
Stella
writes
like
an
emperor
,
and
gives
such
an
account
of
her
journey
,
never
saw
the
like
.
 
<EOS>
Let
me
see
<EOS>
;
stand
away
,
let
us
compute
;
you
stayed
four
days
at
Inish
-
Corthy
,
two
nights
at
Mrs.
Proby
's
mother
's
,
and
yet
was
but
six
days
in
journey
;
for
your
words
are
,
"
We
left
Wexford
this
day
se'ennight
,
and
came
here
last
night
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
have
heard
them
say
that
"
travellers
may
lie
by
authority
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Make
up
this
,
if
you
can
.
 
<EOS>
How
far
is
it
from
Wexford
to
Dublin
?
<EOS>
how
many
miles
did
you
travel
in
a
day
?
 
<EOS>
Let
me
see
 
thirty
pounds
in
two
months
is
nine
score
pounds
a
year
;
a
matter
of
nothing
in
Stella
's
purse
!
 
<EOS>
I
dreamed
Billy
Swift
was
alive
,
and
that
I
told
him
you
writ
<EOS>
me
word
he
was
dead
,
and
that
you
had
been
at
his
funeral
;
<EOS>
and
I
admired
at
your
impudence
,
and
was
in
mighty
haste
to
run
and
let
you
know
what
lying
rogues
you
were
.
<EOS>
Poor
lad
!
<EOS>
he
is
dead
of
his
mother
's
former
folly
and
fondness
;
and
yet
now
I
believe
,
as
you
say
,
that
her
grief
will
soon
wear
off
.
 
<EOS>
O
yes
,
Madam
Dingley
,
mightily
tired
of
the
company
,
no
doubt
of
it
,
at
Wexford
!
 
<EOS>
And
your
description
of
it
is
excellent
;
clean
sheets
,
but
bare
walls
;
I
suppose
then
you
lay
upon
the
walls
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Walls
has
got
her
tea
;
but
who
pays
me
the
money
?
 
<EOS>
Come
,
I
shall
never
get
it
;
so
I
make
a
present
of
it
,
to
stop
some
gaps
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
Where
's
the
thanks
of
the
house
?
 
<EOS>
So
,
that
's
well
;
why
,
it
cost
four
-
and
-
thirty
shillings
<EOS>
English
 
you
must
adjust
that
with
Mrs.
Walls
;
I
think
that
is
so
many
pence
more
with
you
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
Leigh
and
Sterne
<EOS>
,
I
suppose
,
were
not
at
the
water
-
side
:
 
<EOS>
I
fear
Sterne
's
business
will
not
be
done
;
I
have
not
seen
him
<EOS>
this
good
while
.
 
<EOS>
I
hate
him
,
for
the
management
of
that
box
;
and
I
was
the
greatest
fool
in
nature
for
trusting
to
such
a
young
jackanapes
;
I
will
speak
to
him
once
more
about
it
,
when
I
see
him
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Addison
and
I
met
once
more
since
,
and
I
supped
with
him
;
I
believe
I
told
you
so
somewhere
in
this
letter
.
 
<EOS>
The
Archbishop
chose
an
admirable
messenger
in
Walls
,
to
send
to
me
;
yet
I
think
him
fitter
for
a
messenger
than
anything
.
 
<EOS>
The
D
#
#
#
#
<EOS>
she
has
!
<EOS>
I
did
not
observe
her
looks
.
 
<EOS>
Will
she
rot
out
of
modesty
with
Lady
Giffard
?
<EOS>
I
pity
poor
Jenny
 
b
ut
<EOS>
her
husband
is
a
dunce
,
and
with
respect
to
him
she
loses
little
by
her
deafness
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
,
Madam
Stella
,
in
your
accounts
you
mistook
one
liquor
for
another
,
and
it
was
an
hundred
and
forty
quarts
of
wine
,
and
thirty
-
two
of
water
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
all
written
in
the
morning
before
I
go
to
the
Secretary
,
as
I
am
now
doing
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
answered
your
letter
a
little
shorter
than
ordinary
;
but
I
have
a
mind
it
should
go
to
-
day
,
and
I
will
give
you
my
journal
at
night
in
my
next
;
for
I
'm
so
afraid
of
another
letter
before
this
goes
:
 
<EOS>
I
will
never
have
two
together
again
unanswered
.
 
<EOS>
What
care
I
for
Dr.
Tisdall
and
Dr.
Raymond
,
or
how
many
children
they
have
!
 
<EOS>
I
wish
they
had
a
hundred
apiece
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Treasurer
promises
me
to
answer
the
bishops
'
letter
to
-
morrow
,
and
show
it
me
;
and
I
believe
it
will
confirm
all
I
said
,
and
mortify
those
that
threw
the
merit
on
the
Duke
of
Ormond
;
for
I
have
made
him
jealous
of
it
;
and
t'other
day
,
talking
of
the
matter
,
he
said
,
"
I
am
your
witness
,
you
got
it
for
them
before
the
Duke
was
Lord
Lieutenant
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
My
humble
service
to
Mrs.
Walls

Mrs.
Stoyte

Catherine

<EOS>
Farewell
,
etc
.
  
<EOS>
What
do
you
do
when
you
see
any
literal
mistakes
in
my
letters
?
<EOS>
how
do
you
set
them
right
?
<EOS>
for
I
never
read
them
over
to
correct
them
.
 
<EOS>
Farewell
,
again
.
  
<EOS>
Pray
send
this
note
to

LETTER
31
.
 
<EOS>
LONDON
,
Sept.
25
,
1711
.
  
<EOS>
I
dined
in
the
City
to
-
day
,
and
at
my
return
I
put
my
30th
into
the
post
-
office
;
and
when
I
got
home
<EOS>
I
found
for
me
one
of
the
noblest
letters
I
ever
read
:
 
<EOS>
it
was
from
#
#
#
#
,
 
three
sides
and
a
half
in
folio
,
on
a
large
sheet
of
paper
;
the
two
first
pages
made
up
of
satire
upon
London
,
and
crowds
and
hurry
,
stolen
from
some
of
his
own
schoolboy
's
exercises
:
 
the
side
and
a
half
remaining
is
spent
in
desiring
me
to
recommend
Mrs.
South
,
your
Commissioner
's
widow
,
to
my
Lord
Treasurer
for
a
pension
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
the
prettiest
,
discreetest
fellow
that
ever
my
eyes
beheld
,
or
that
ever
dipped
pen
into
ink
.
<EOS>
I
know
not
what
to
say
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
A
pox
on
him
<EOS>
,
I
have
too
many
such
customers
on
this
side
already
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
will
send
him
word
that
I
never
saw
my
Lord
Treasurer
in
my
life
:
 
<EOS>
I
am
sure
I
industriously
avoided
the
name
of
any
great
person
when
I
saw
him
,
for
fear
of
his
reporting
it
in
Ireland
.
 
<EOS>
And
this
recommendation
must
be
a
secret
too
,
for
fear
<EOS>
the
Duke
of
Bolton
should
know
it
,
and
think
it
was
too
mean
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
read
so
d####d
a
letter
in
my
life
:
 
<EOS>
a
little
would
make
me
send
it
over
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
send
you
a
pattern
,
the
first
place
I
cast
my
eyes
on
<EOS>
,
I
will
not
pick
and
choose
.
 
<EOS>
IN
THIS
PLACE
<EOS>
(
meaning
the
Exchange
in
London
)
,
WHICH
IS
THE
COMPENDIUM
OF
OLD
TROYNOVANT
,
<EOS>
AS
THAT
IS
OF
THE
WHOLE
BUSY
WORLD
,
I
GOT
SUCH
A
SURFEIT
,
THAT
<EOS>
I
GREW
SICK
OF
MANKIND
,
AND
RESOLVED
FOR
EVER
<EOS>
AFTER
TO
BURY
MYSELF
IN
THE
SHADY
RETREAT
OF
     
.
 
<EOS>
You
must
know
that
London
has
been
called
by
some
Troynovant
,
or
New
Troy
.
 
<EOS>
Will
you
have
any
more
?
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
one
little
bit
for
Stella
,
because
she
'll
be
fond
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
This
wondrous
theatre
(
meaning
London
)
was
no
more
to
me
than
a
desert
,
and
I
should
less
complain
of
solitude
in
a
Connaught
shipwreck
,
or
even
the
great
bog
of
Allen
.
 
<EOS>
A
little
scrap
for
Mrs.
Marget
,
<EOS>
and
then
I
have
done
.
 
<EOS>
THEIR
ROYAL
FANUM
,
WHEREIN
<EOS>
THE
IDOL
PECUNIA
IS
DAILY
WORSHIPPED
,
SEEMED
TO
ME
<EOS>
TO
BE
<EOS>
JUST
LIKE
A
HIVE
OF
BEES
WORKING
AND
LABOURING
UNDER
HUGE
WEIGHTS
OF
CARES
.
 
<EOS>
Fanum
is
a
temple
,
but
he
means
the
Exchange
;
and
Pecunia
is
money
:
 
<EOS>
so
now
Mrs.
Marget
will
understand
her
part
.
 
<EOS>
One
more
paragraph
,
and
I
#
#
#
#
 
<EOS>
Well
,
come
,
do
n't
be
in
such
a
rage
,
you
shall
have
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
,
Stella
,
be
satisfied
;
'
tis
very
pretty
:
 
and
that
I
must
be
acquainted
with
such
a
dog
as
this
!
 
<EOS>
Our
peace
goes
on
fast
.
 
<EOS>
Prior
was
with
the
Secretary
two
hours
this
morning
:
 
<EOS>
I
was
there
a
little
after
he
went
away
,
and
was
told
it
.
<EOS>
I
believe
he
will
soon
be
despatched
again
to
France
;
and
I
will
put
somebody
to
write
an
account
of
his
second
journey
:
 
<EOS>
I
hope
you
have
seen
the
other
.
<EOS>
This
latter
has
taken
up
my
time
with
storming
at
it
.
  
<EOS>

<EOS>
Bernage
has
been
with
me
these
two
days
;
yesterday
I
sent
for
him
to
let
him
know
that
Dr.
Arbuthnot
is
putting
in
strongly
to
have
his
brother
made
a
captain
over
Bernage
's
head
.
 
<EOS>
Arbuthnot
's
brother
is
but
an
ensign
,
but
the
Doctor
has
great
power
with
the
Queen
:
 
yet
he
told
me
he
would
not
do
anything
hard
to
a
gentleman
who
is
my
friend
;
and
I
have
engaged
the
Secretary
and
his
Colonel
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
To
-
day
he
told
me
very
melancholy
,
that
the
other
had
written
from
Windsor
(
where
he
went
to
solicit
)
that
he
has
got
the
company
;
and
Bernage
is
full
of
the
spleen
.
 
<EOS>
I
made
the
Secretary
write
yesterday
a
letter
to
the
Colonel
in
Bernage
's
behalf
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
it
will
do
yet
;
and
I
have
written
to
Dr.
Arbuthnot
to
Windsor
,
not
to
insist
on
doing
such
a
hardship
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
in
the
City
at
Pontack
's
,
with
Stratford
;
it
cost
me
seven
shillings
:
 
he
would
have
treated
,
but
I
did
not
let
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
removed
my
money
from
the
Bank
to
another
fund
.
 
<EOS>
I
desire
Parvisol
may
speak
to
Hawkshaw
to
pay
in
my
money
when
he
can
,
for
I
will
put
it
in
the
funds
;
and
,
in
the
meantime
,
borrow
so
much
of
Mr.
Secretary
,
who
offers
to
lend
it
me
.
 
<EOS>
Go
to
the
Dean
's
,
sirrahs
.
  
<EOS>

<EOS>
Bernage
was
with
me
again
to
-
day
,
and
is
in
great
fear
,
and
so
was
I
;
but
this
afternoon
,
at
Lord
Treasurer
's
,
where
I
dined
,
my
brother
,
George
Granville
,
Secretary
at
War
,
after
keeping
me
a
while
in
suspense
,
told
me
that
Dr.
Arbuthnot
had
waived
the
business
,
because
he
would
not
wrong
a
friend
of
mine
;
that
his
brother
is
to
be
a
lieutenant
,
and
Bernage
is
made
a
captain
.
 
<EOS>
I
called
at
his
lodging
,
and
<EOS>
the
soldier
's
coffee
-
house
,
to
put
him
out
of
pain
,
but
can
not
find
him
;
so
I
have
left
word
,
and
shall
see
him
to
-
morrow
morning
,
I
suppose
.
 
<EOS>
Bernage
is
now
easy
;
he
has
ten
shillings
a
day
,
beside
lawful
cheating
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
he
gives
a
private
sum
to
his
Colonel
,
but
it
is
very
cheap
:
 
<EOS>
his
Colonel
loves
him
well
,
but
is
surprised
to
see
him
have
so
many
friends
.
 
<EOS>
So
he
is
now
quite
off
my
hands
.
 
<EOS>
I
left
the
company
early
to
-
night
,
at
Lord
Treasurer
's
;
but
the
Secretary
followed
me
,
to
desire
I
would
go
with
him
to
W
#
#
#
#
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Lewis
's
man
came
in
before
I
could
finish
that
word
beginning
with
a
W
,
which
ought
to
be
Windsor
,
and
brought
me
a
very
handsome
rallying
letter
from
Dr.
Arbuthnot
,
to
tell
me
he
had
,
in
compliance
to
me
,
given
up
his
brother
's
pretensions
in
favour
of
Bernage
,
this
very
morning
;
that
the
Queen
had
spoken
to
Mr.
Granville
to
make
the
company
easy
in
the
other
's
having
the
captainship
.
 
<EOS>
Whether
they
have
done
it
to
oblige
me
or
no
,
I
must
own
it
so
.
 
<EOS>
He
says
he
this
very
morning
begged
Her
Majesty
to
give
Mr.
Bernage
the
company
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
mighty
well
pleased
to
have
succeeded
so
well
;
but
you
will
think
me
tedious
,
although
you
like
the
man
,
as
I
think
.
  
<EOS>
Windsor
,
28
.
 
<EOS>
I
came
here
a
day
sooner
than
ordinary
,
at
Mr.
Secretary
's
desire
,
and
supped
with
him
and
Prior
,
and
two
private
Ministers
from
France
,
and
a
French
priest
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
not
the
two
Ministers
'
names
;
but
they
are
come
about
the
peace
.
 
<EOS>
The
names
the
Secretary
called
them
,
I
suppose
,
were
feigned
;
they
were
good
rational
men
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
already
settled
all
things
with
France
,
and
very
much
to
the
honour
and
advantage
of
England
;
and
the
Queen
is
in
mighty
good
humour
.
 
<EOS>
All
this
news
is
a
mighty
secret
;
the
people
in
general
know
that
a
peace
is
forwarding
.
 
<EOS>
The
Earl
of
Strafford
is
to
go
soon
to
Holland
,
and
let
them
know
what
we
have
been
doing
:
 
and
then
there
will
be
the
devil
and
all
to
pay
;
but
we
'll
make
them
swallow
it
with
a
pox
.
<EOS>
The
French
Ministers
stayed
with
us
till
one
,
and
the
Secretary
<EOS>
and
I
sat
up
talking
till
two
;
so
you
will
own
'
tis
late
,
sirrahs
,
and
time
for
your
little
saucy
Presto
to
go
to
bed
and
sleep
adazy
;
and
God
bless
poor
little
MD
:
 
<EOS>
I
hope
they
are
now
fast
asleep
,
and
dreaming
of
Presto
.
  
<EOS>

<EOS>
Lord
Treasurer
came
to
-
night
,
as
usual
,
at
half
an
hour
after
eight
,
as
dark
as
pitch
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
weary
of
chiding
him
;
so
I
commended
him
for
observing
his
friend
's
advice
,
and
coming
so
early
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
two
hours
with
Lady
Oglethorpe
to
-
night
,
and
then
supped
with
Lord
Treasurer
,
after
dining
at
the
Green
Cloth
:
 
<EOS>
I
stayed
till
two
;
this
is
the
effect
of
Lord
Treasurer
's
being
here
;
I
must
sup
with
him
;
and
he
keeps
cursed
hours
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Keeper
and
the
Secretary
were
absent
;
they
can
not
sit
up
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
This
long
sitting
up
makes
the
periods
in
my
letters
so
short
.
 
<EOS>
I
design
to
stay
here
all
the
next
week
,
to
be
at
leisure
by
myself
,
to
finish
something
of
weight
I
have
upon
my
hands
,
and
which
must
soon
be
done
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
then
think
of
returning
to
Ireland
,
if
these
people
will
let
me
;
and
I
know
nothing
else
they
have
for
me
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
I
gave
Dr.
Arbuthnot
my
thanks
for
his
kindness
to
Bernage
,
whose
commission
is
now
signed
.
 
<EOS>
Methinks
I
long
to
know
something
of
Stella
's
health
,
how
it
continues
after
Wexford
waters
.

<EOS>
The
Queen
was
not
at
chapel
to
-
day
,
and
all
for
the
better
,
for
we
had
a
dunce
to
preach
:
 
<EOS>
she
has
a
little
of
the
gout
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
with
my
brother
Masham
,
and
a
moderate
company
,
and
would
not
go
to
Lord
Treasurer
's
till
after
supper
at
eleven
o'clock
,
and
pretended
I
had
mistaken
the
hour
;
so
I
ate
nothing
:
 
and
a
little
after
twelve
the
company
broke
up
,
the
Keeper
and
Secretary
refusing
to
stay
;
<EOS>
so
I
saved
this
night
's
debauch
.
 
<EOS>
Prior
went
away
yesterday
with
his
Frenchmen
,
and
a
thousand
reports
are
raised
in
this
town
.
<EOS>
Some
said
they
knew
one
to
be
the
Abbe
de
Polignac
:
 
others
swore
it
was
the
Abbe
du
Bois
.
 
<EOS>
The
Whigs
are
in
a
rage
about
the
peace
;
but
we
'll
wherret
them
,
I
warrant
,
boys
.
 
<EOS>
Go
,
go
,
go
to
the
Dean
's
and
do
n't
mind
politics
,
young
women
<EOS>
,
they
are
not
good
after
the
waters
;
they
are
stark
naught
:
 
they
strike
up
into
the
head
.
 
<EOS>
Go
,
get
two
black
aces
,
and
fish
for
a
manilio

Sir
John
Walter
,
an
honest
drunken
fellow
,
is
now
in
waiting
,
and
invited
me
to
the
Green
Cloth
to
-
day
,
that
he
might
not
be
behindhand
with
Colonel
Godfrey
,
who
is
a
Whig
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
engaged
to
the
Mayor
's
feast
with
Mr.
Masham
;
but
waiting
to
take
leave
of
Lord
Treasurer
<EOS>
,
I
came
too
late
,
and
so
returned
sneaking
to
the
Green
Cloth
,
and
did
not
see
my
Lord
Treasurer
neither
;
but
was
resolved
not
to
lose
two
dinners
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
took
leave
to
-
day
of
my
friend
and
solicitor
Lord
Rivers
,
who
is
commanded
by
the
Queen
to
set
out
for
Hanover
on
Thursday
.
 
<EOS>
The
Secretary
does
not
go
to
town
till
to
-
morrow
;
he
and
I
,
and
two
friends
more
,
drank
a
sober
bottle
of
wine
here
at
home
,
and
parted
at
twelve
;
he
goes
by
seven
to
-
morrow
morning
,
so
I
shall
not
see
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
power
over
his
cellar
in
his
absence
,
and
make
little
use
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Dartmouth
and
my
friend
Lewis
stay
here
this
week
;
but
I
can
never
work
out
a
dinner
from
Dartmouth
.
 
<EOS>
Masham
has
promised
to
provide
for
me
:
 
<EOS>
I
squired
his
lady
out
of
her
chaise
to
-
day
,
and
must
visit
her
in
a
day
or
two
.
<EOS>
So
you
have
had
a
long
fit
of
the
finest
weather
in
the
world
;
but
I
am
every
day
in
pain
that
it
will
go
off
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
done
no
business
to
-
day
;
I
am
very
idle
.

<EOS>
My
friend
Lewis
and
I
,
to
avoid
over
much
eating
and
great
tables
,
dined
with
honest
Jemmy
Eckershall
,
Clerk
of
the
Kitchen
,
now
in
waiting
,
and
I
bespoke
my
dinner
:
 
but
the
cur
had
your
acquaintance
Lovet
,
the
gentleman
porter
,
to
be
our
company
.
 
<EOS>
Lovet
,
towards
the
end
of
dinner
,
after
twenty
wrigglings
,
said
he
had
the
honour
to
see
me
formerly
at
Moor
Park
,
and
thought
he
remembered
my
face
.
 
<EOS>
I
said
I
thought
I
remembered
him
,
and
was
glad
to
see
him
,
etc
.
,
and
I
escaped
for
that
much
,
for
he
was
very
pert
.
 
<EOS>
It
has
rained
all
this
day
,
and
I
doubt
our
good
weather
is
gone
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
very
idle
this
afternoon
,
playing
at
twelvepenny
picquet
with
Lewis
:
 
<EOS>
I
won
seven
shillings
,
which
is
the
only
money
I
won
this
year
:
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
played
above
four
times
,
and
I
think
always
at
Windsor
.
 
<EOS>
Cards
are
very
dear
:
 
there
is
a
duty
on
them
of
sixpence
a
pack
,
which
spoils
small
gamesters
.
  
<EOS>

.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Masham
sent
this
morning
to
desire
I
would
ride
out
with
him
,
the
weather
growing
again
very
fine
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
very
busy
,
and
sent
my
excuses
;
but
desired
he
would
provide
me
a
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
with
him
,
his
lady
,
and
her
sister
,
Mrs.
Hill
,
who
invites
us
to
-
morrow
to
dine
with
her
,
and
we
are
to
ride
out
in
the
morning
.
 
<EOS>
I
sat
with
Lady
Oglethorpe
till
eight
this
evening
,
then
was
going
home
to
write
;
looked
about
for
the
woman
that
keeps
the
key
of
the
house
:
 
<EOS>
she
told
me
Patrick
had
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
cooled
my
heels
in
the
cloisters
till
nine
,
then
went
in
to
the
music
-
meeting
,
where
I
had
been
often
desired
to
go
;
but
was
weary
in
half
an
hour
of
their
fine
stuff
,
and
stole
out
so
privately
that
everybody
saw
me
;
and
cooled
my
heels
in
the
cloisters
again
till
after
ten
:
 
then
came
in
Patrick
.
 
<EOS>
I
went
up
,
shut
the
chamber
door
,
and
gave
him
two
or
three
swinging
cuffs
on
the
ear
,
and
I
have
strained
the
thumb
of
my
left
hand
with
pulling
him
,
which
I
did
not
feel
until
he
was
gone
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
plaguily
afraid
and
humbled
.
  
<EOS>

<EOS>
It
was
the
finest
day
in
the
world
,
and
we
got
out
before
eleven
,
a
noble
caravan
of
us
.
 
<EOS>
The
Duchess
of
Shrewsbury
in
her
own
chaise
with
one
horse
,
and
Miss
Touchet
with
her
,
Mrs.
Masham
and
Mrs.
Scarborow
,
one
of
the
dressers
,
in
one
of
the
Queen
's
chaises
;
Miss
Forester
and
Miss
Scarborow
,
two
maids
of
honour
,
and
Mrs.
Hill
on
horseback
.
 
<EOS>
The
Duke
of
Shrewsbury
,
Mr.
Masham
,
George
Fielding
,
Arbuthnot
,
and
I
,
on
horseback
too
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Hill
's
horse
was
hired
for
Miss
Scarborow
,
but
she
took
it
in
civility
;
her
own
horse
was
galled
and
could
not
be
rid
,
but
kicked
and
winced
:
 
the
hired
horse
was
not
worth
eighteenpence
.
 
<EOS>
I
borrowed
coat
,
boots
,
and
horse
,
and
in
short
we
had
all
the
difficulties
,
and
more
than
we
used
to
have
in
making
a
party
from
Trim
to
Longfield
's
.
 
<EOS>
My
coat
was
light
camlet
,
faced
with
red
velvet
,
and
silver
buttons
.
 
<EOS>
We
rode
in
the
great
park
and
the
forest
about
a
dozen
miles
,
and
the
Duchess
<EOS>
and
I
had
much
conversation
:
 
<EOS>
we
got
home
by
two
,
and
Mr.
Masham
,
his
lady
,
Arbuthnot
and
I
,
dined
with
Mrs.
Hill
.
 
<EOS>
Arbuthnot
made
us
all
melancholy
,
by
some
symptoms
of
bloody
u####e
:
 
he
expects
a
cruel
fit
of
the
stone
in
twelve
hours
;
he
says
he
is
never
mistaken
,
and
he
appears
like
a
man
that
was
to
be
racked
to
-
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
but
hope
it
will
not
be
so
bad
;
he
is
a
perfectly
honest
man
,
and
one
I
have
much
obligation
to
.
 
<EOS>
It
rained
a
little
this
afternoon
,
and
grew
fair
again
.
 
<EOS>
Lady
Oglethorpe
sent
to
speak
to
me
,
and
it
was
to
let
me
know
that
Lady
Rochester
desires
she
and
I
may
be
better
acquainted
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
a
little
too
late
;
for
I
am
not
now
in
love
with
Lady
Rochester
:
 
<EOS>
they
shame
me
out
of
her
,
because
she
is
old
.
 
<EOS>
Arbuthnot
says
he
hopes
my
strained
thumb
is
not
the
gout
;
for
he
has
often
found
people
so
mistaken
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
remember
the
particular
thing
that
gave
it
me
,
only
I
had
it
just
after
beating
Patrick
,
and
now
it
is
better
;
so
I
believe
he
is
mistaken
.

<EOS>
The
Duchess
of
Shrewsbury
sent
to
invite
me
to
dinner
;
but
I
was
abroad
last
night
when
her
servant
came
,
and
this
morning
I
sent
my
excuses
,
because
I
was
engaged
,
which
I
was
sorry
for
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Forester
taxed
me
yesterday
about
the
History
of
the
Maids
of
Honour
;
but
I
told
her
fairly
it
was
no
jest
of
mine
;
for
I
found
they
did
not
relish
it
altogether
well
;
and
I
have
enough
already
of
a
quarrel
with
that
brute
Sir
John
Walter
,
who
has
been
railing
at
me
in
all
companies
ever
since
I
dined
with
him
;
that
I
abused
the
Queen
's
meat
and
drink
,
and
said
nothing
at
the
table
was
good
,
and
all
a
d####d
lie
;
for
after
dinner
,
commending
the
wine
,
I
said
I
thought
it
was
something
small
.
 
<EOS>
You
would
wonder
how
all
my
friends
laugh
at
this
quarrel
.
 
<EOS>
It
will
be
such
a
jest
for
the
Keeper
,
Treasurer
,
and
Secretary
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
with
honest
Colonel
Godfrey
,
took
a
good
walk
of
an
hour
on
the
terrace
,
and
then
came
up
to
study
;
but
it
grows
bloody
cold
,
and
I
have
no
waistcoat
here
.
  
<EOS>

.
 
<EOS>
I
never
dined
with
the
chaplains
till
to
-
day
;
but
my
friend
Gastrell
and
the
Dean
of
Rochester
had
often
invited
me
,
and
I
happened
to
be
disengaged
:
 
<EOS>
it
is
the
worst
provided
table
at
Court
.
 
<EOS>
We
ate
on
pewter
:
<EOS>
every
chaplain
,
when
he
is
made
a
dean
,
gives
a
piece
of
plate
,
and
so
they
have
got
a
little
,
some
of
it
very
old
.
 
<EOS>
One
who
was
made
Dean
of
Peterborough
(
a
small
deanery
)
said
he
would
give
no
plate
;
he
was
only
Dean
of
Pewterborough
.
 
<EOS>
The
news
of
Mr.
Hill
's
miscarriage
in
his
expedition
came
to
-
day
,
and
I
went
to
visit
Mrs.
Masham
and
Mrs.
Hill
,
his
two
sisters
,
to
condole
with
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
advised
them
by
all
means
to
go
to
the
music
-
meeting
to
-
night
,
to
show
they
were
not
cast
down
,
etc
.
,
and
they
thought
my
advice
was
right
,
and
went
.
 
<EOS>
I
doubt
Mr.
Hill
and
his
admiral
made
wrong
steps
;
however
,
we
lay
it
all
to
a
storm
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
I
sat
with
the
Secretary
at
supper
;
then
we
both
went
to
Lord
Treasurer
's
supper
,
and
sat
till
twelve
.
 
<EOS>
The
Secretary
is
much
mortified
about
Hill
,
because
this
expedition
was
of
his
contriving
,
and
he
counted
much
upon
it
;
but
Lord
Treasurer
was
just
as
merry
as
usual
,
and
old
laughing
at
Sir
John
Walter
and
me
falling
out
.
 
<EOS>
I
said
nothing
grieved
me
but
that
they
would
take
example
,
and
perhaps
presume
upon
it
,
and
get
out
of
my
government
;
but
that
I
thought
I
was
not
obliged
to
govern
bears
,
though
I
governed
men
.
 
<EOS>
They
promise
to
be
as
obedient
as
ever
,
and
so
we
laughed
;
and
<EOS>
so
I
go
to
bed
;
for
it
is
colder
still
,
and
you
have
a
fire
now
,
and
are
at
cards
at
home
.

<EOS>
Lord
Harley
and
I
dined
privately
to
-
day
with
Mrs.
Masham
and
Mrs.
Hill
,
and
my
brother
Masham
.
 
<EOS>
I
saw
Lord
Halifax
at
Court
,
and
we
joined
and
talked
;
and
the
Duchess
of
Shrewsbury
came
up
and
reproached
me
for
not
dining
with
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
said
that
was
not
so
soon
done
,
for
I
expected
more
advances
from
ladies
,
<EOS>
especially
duchesses
:
 
<EOS>
she
promised
to
comply
with
any
demands
I
pleased
;
and
I
agreed
to
dine
with
her
to
-
morrow
,
if
I
did
not
go
to
London
too
soon
,
as
I
believe
I
shall
before
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
Lady
Oglethorpe
brought
me
and
the
Duchess
of
Hamilton
together
to
-
day
in
the
drawing
-
room
,
and
I
have
given
her
some
encouragement
,
but
not
much
.
 
<EOS>
Everybody
has
been
teasing
Walter
.
 
<EOS>
He
told
Lord
Treasurer
that
he
took
his
company
from
him
that
were
to
dine
with
him
:
 
<EOS>
my
lord
said
,
"
I
will
send
you
Dr.
Swift
:
"
 
Lord
Keeper
bid
him
take
care
what
he
did
;
"
for
,
"
said
he
,
"
Dr.
Swift
is
not
only
all
our
favourite
,
but
our
governor
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
old
company
supped
with
Lord
Treasurer
,
and
got
away
by
twelve
.
  
<EOS>
London
,
8
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
I
shall
go
no
more
to
Windsor
,
for
we
expect
the
Queen
will
come
in
ten
days
to
Hampton
Court
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
frost
last
night
,
and
cruel
cold
to
-
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
dine
with
the
Duchess
,
for
I
left
Windsor
half
an
hour
after
one
with
Lord
Treasurer
,
and
we
called
at
Kensington
,
where
Mrs.
Masham
was
got
to
see
her
children
for
two
days
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
,
or
rather
supped
,
with
Lord
Treasurer
,
and
stayed
till
after
ten
.
 
<EOS>
Tisdall
and
his
family
are
gone
from
hence

upon
some
wrangle
with
the

<EOS>
Yesterday
I
had
two
letters
brought
me
to
Mr.
Masham
's
;
one
from
Ford
,
and
t'other
from
our
little
MD
,
N.21
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
not
tell
you
till
to
-
day
,
because
I
would
not
.
 
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
answer
it
till
the
next
,
because
I
have
slipped
two
days
by
being
at
Windsor
,
which
I
must
recover
here
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
sirrahs
,
I
must
go

<EOS>
The
roads
were

hard

I
suppose
our
fair
weather
is
now
at
an
end

<EOS>
I
think
I
'll
put
on
my
waistcoat
to

day
:
 
<EOS>
shall
I
?
 
<EOS>
Well
,
I
will
then

to
please
MD

I
think
of
dining
at

LETTER
32
.
 
<EOS>
LONDON
,
Oct.
9
,
1711
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
forced
to
lie
down
at
twelve
to
-
day
,
and
mend
my
night
's
sleep
:
 
<EOS>
I
slept
till
after
two
,
and
then
sent
for
a
bit
of
mutton
and
pot
of
ale
from
the
next
cook
's
shop
,
and
had
no
stomach
.
 
<EOS>
I
went
out
at
four
,
and
called
to
see
Biddy
Floyd
,
which
I
had
not
done
these
three
months
:
 
<EOS>
she
is
something
marked
,
but
has
recovered
her
complexion
quite
,
and
looks
very
well
.
 
<EOS>
Then
I
sat
the
evening
with
Mrs.
Vanhomrigh
,
and
drank
coffee
,
and
ate
an
egg
.
 
<EOS>
I
likewise
took
a
new
lodging
to
-
day
,
not
liking
a
ground
-
floor
,
nor
the
ill
smell
,
and
other
circumstances
.
 
<EOS>
I
lodge
,
or
shall
lodge
,
by
Leicester
Fields
,
and
pay
ten
shillings
a
week
;
that
wo
n't
hold
out
long
,
faith
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
lie
here
<EOS>
but
one
night
more
.
 
<EOS>
It
rained
terribly
till
one
o'clock
to
-
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
lie
,
for
I
shall
lie
here
two
nights
,
till
Thursday
,
and
then
remove
.
 
<EOS>
Did
I
tell
you
that
my
friend
Mrs.
Barton
has
a
brother
drowned
,
that
went
on
the
expedition
with
Jack
Hill
?
 
<EOS>
He
was
a
lieutenant
-
colonel
,
and
a
coxcomb
;
and
she
keeps
her
chamber
in
form
,
and
the
servants
say
she
receives
no
messages
.
 
<EOS>
Answer
MD
's
letter
,
Presto
,
d'ye
hear
?
 
<EOS>
No
,
says
Presto
,
I
wo
n't
yet
,
I
'm
busy
;
you
're
a
saucy
rogue
.
 
<EOS>
Who
talks
?

<EOS>
It
cost
me
two
shillings
in
coach
-
hire
to
dine
in
the
City
with
a
printer
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
sent
,
and
caused
to
be
sent
,
three
pamphlets
out
in
a
fortnight
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
ply
the
rogues
warm
;
and
whenever
anything
of
theirs
makes
a
noise
,
it
shall
have
an
answer
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
instructed
an
under
spur
-
leather
to
write
so
,
that
it
is
taken
for
mine
.
 
<EOS>
A
rogue
that
writes
a
newspaper
,
called
The
Protestant
Postboy
,
has
reflected
on
me
in
one
of
his
papers
;
but
the
Secretary
has
taken
him
up
,
and
he
shall
have
a
squeeze
extraordinary
.
 
<EOS>
He
says
that
an
ambitious
tantivy
,
missing
of
his
towering
hopes
of
preferment
in
Ireland
,
is
come
over
to
vent
his
spleen
on
the
late
Ministry
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
tantivy
him
with
a
vengeance
.
 
<EOS>
I
sat
the
evening
at
home
,
and
am
very
busy
,
and
can
hardly
find
time
to
write
,
unless
it
were
to
MD
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
in
furious
haste
.

<EOS>
I
dined
to
-
day
with
Lord
Treasurer
.
 
<EOS>
Thursdays
are
now
his
days
when
his
choice
company
comes
,
but
we
are
too
much
multiplied
.
 
<EOS>
George
Granville
sent
his
excuses
upon
being
ill
;
I
hear
he
apprehends
the
apoplexy
,
which
would
grieve
me
much
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Treasurer
calls
Prior
nothing
but
Monsieur
Baudrier
,
which
was
the
feigned
name
of
the
Frenchman
that
writ
his
Journey
to
Paris
.
<EOS>
They
pretend
to
suspect
me
,
so
I
talk
freely
of
it
,
and
put
them
out
of
their
play
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Treasurer
calls
me
now
Dr.
Martin
,
because
martin
is
a
sort
of
a
swallow
,
and
so
is
a
swift
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
and
I
came
last
Monday
from
Windsor
,
we
were
reading
all
the
signs
on
the
road
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
a
pure
trifler
;
tell
the
Bishop
of
Clogher
so
.
 
<EOS>
I
made
him
make
two
lines
in
verse
for
the
Bell
and
Dragon
,
and
they
were
rare
bad
ones
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
Dilly
is
with
you
by
this
time
:
 
what
could
his
reason
be
of
leaving
London
,
and
not
owning
it
?
 
<EOS>
'
Twas
plaguy
silly
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
his
natural
inconstancy
made
him
weary
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
he
is
the
king
of
inconstancy
.
 
<EOS>
I
stayed
with
Lord
Treasurer
till
ten
;
we
had
five
lords
and
three
commoners
.
 
<EOS>
Go
to
ombre
,
sirrahs

Mrs.
Vanhomrigh
has
changed
her
lodging
as
well
as
I.
 
<EOS>
She
found
she
had
got
with
a
bawd
,
and
removed
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
with
her
to
-
day
;
for
though
she
boards
,
her
landlady
does
not
dine
with
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
grown
a
mighty
lover
of
herrings
;
but
they
are
much
smaller
here
than
with
you
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
afternoon
I
visited
an
old
major
-
general
,
and
ate
six
oysters
;
then
sat
an
hour
with
Mrs.
Colledge
,
the
joiner
's
daughter
that
was
hanged
;
it
was
the
joiner
was
hanged
,
and
not
his
daughter
;
with
Thompson
's
wife
,
a
magistrate
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
the
famous
Mrs.
Floyd
of
Chester
,
who
,
I
think
,
is
the
handsomest
woman
(
except
MD
)
that
ever
I
saw
.
 
<EOS>
She
told
me
that
twenty
people
had
sent
her
the
verses
upon
Biddy
,
as
meant
to
her
:
 
and
,
indeed
,
in
point
of
handsomeness
,
she
deserves
them
much
better
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
not
go
to
Windsor
to
-
morrow
,
and
so
I
told
the
Secretary
to
-
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
hate
the
thoughts
of
Saturday
and
Sunday
suppers
with
Lord
Treasurer
.
 
<EOS>
Jack
Hill
is
come
home
from
his
unfortunate
expedition
,
and
is
,
I
think
,
now
at
Windsor
:
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
yet
seen
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
privately
blamed
by
his
own
friends
for
want
of
conduct
.
 
<EOS>
He
called
a
council
of
war
,
and
therein
it
was
determined
to
come
back
.
 
<EOS>
But
they
say
a
general
should
not
do
that
,
because
the
officers
will
always
give
their
opinion
for
returning
,
since
the
blame
will
not
lie
upon
them
,
but
the
general
.
 
<EOS>
I
pity
him
heartily
.
<EOS>
Bernage
received
his
commission
to
-
day
.
  
<EOS>

.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
to
-
day
with
Colonel
Crowe
,
late
Governor
of
Barbadoes
;
he
is
a
great
acquaintance
of
your
friend
Sterne
,
to
whom
I
trusted
the
box
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Treasurer
has
refused
Sterne
's
business
,
and
I
doubt
he
is
a
rake
;
Jemmy
Leigh
stays
for
him
,
and
nobody
knows
where
to
find
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
so
busy
now
<EOS>
I
have
hardly
time
to
spare
to
write
to
our
little
MD
,
but
in
a
fortnight
I
hope
it
will
be
over
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
going
now
to
be
busy
,
etc
.

<EOS>
I
was
going
to
dine
with
Dr.
Cockburn
,
but
Sir
Andrew
Fountaine
met
me
,
and
carried
me
to
Mrs.
Van
's
,
where
I
drank
the
last
bottle
of
Raymond
's
wine
,
admirable
good
,
better
than
any
I
get
among
the
Ministry
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
pick
up
time
to
answer
this
letter
of
MD
's
;
I
'll
do
it
in
a
day
or
two
for
certain
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
glad
I
am
not
at
Windsor
,
for
it
is
very
cold
,
and
I
wo
n't
have
a
fire
till
November
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
contriving
how
to
stop
up
my
grate
with
bricks
.
 
<EOS>
Patrick
was
drunk
last
night
;
but
did
not
come
to
me
,
else
<EOS>
I
should
have
given
him
t'other
cuff
.
 
<EOS>
I
sat
this
evening
with
Mrs.
Barton
;
it
is
the
first
day
of
her
seeing
company
;
but
I
made
her
merry
enough
,
and
we
were
three
hours
disputing
upon
Whig
and
Tory
.
 
<EOS>
She
grieved
for
her
brother
only
for
form
,
and
he
was
a
sad
dog
.
 
<EOS>
Is
Stella
well
enough
to
go
to
church
,
pray
?
<EOS>
no
numbings
left
?
<EOS>
no
darkness
in
your
eyes
?
<EOS>
do
you
walk
and
exercise
?
 
<EOS>
Your
exercise
is
ombre

<EOS>
People
are
coming
up
to
town
:
 
<EOS>
the
Queen
will
be
at
Hampton
Court
in
a
week
.
<EOS>
Lady
Betty
Germaine
,
I
hear
,
is
come
;
and
Lord
Pembroke
is
coming
:
 
<EOS>
his
wife
is
as
big
with
child
as
she
can
tumble
.
  
<EOS>

.
 
<EOS>
I
sat
at
home
till
four
this
afternoon
to
-
day
writing
,
and
ate
a
roll
and
butter
;
then
visited
Will
Congreve
an
hour
or
two
,
and
supped
with
Lord
Treasurer
,
who
came
from
Windsor
to
-
day
,
and
brought
Prior
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
The
Queen
has
thanked
Prior
for
his
good
service
in
France
,
and
promised
to
make
him
a
Commissioner
of
the
Customs
.
 
<EOS>
Several
of
that
Commission
are
to
be
out
;
among
the
rest
,
my
friend
Sir
Matthew
Dudley
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
do
nothing
for
him
<EOS>
,
he
is
so
hated
by
the
Ministry
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Treasurer
kept
me
till
twelve
,
so
I
need
not
tell
you
it
is
now
late
.
  
<EOS>

.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
to
-
day
with
Mr.
Secretary
at
Dr.
Coatesworth
's
,
where
he
now
lodges
till
his
house
be
got
ready
in
Golden
Square
.
 
<EOS>
One
Boyer
,
a
French
dog
,
has
abused
me
in
a
pamphlet
,
and
I
have
got
him
up
in
a
messenger
's
hands
:
 
<EOS>
the
Secretary
promises
me
to
swinge
him
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Treasurer
told
me
last
night
that
he
had
the
honour
to
be
abused
with
me
in
a
pamphlet
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
make
that
rogue
an
example
,
for
warning
to
others
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
to
see
Jack
Hill
this
morning
,
<EOS>
who
made
that
unfortunate
expedition
;
and
there
is
still
more
misfortune
;
for
that
ship
,
which
was
admiral
of
his
fleet
,
is
blown
up
in
the
Thames
,
by
an
accident
and
carelessness
of
some
rogue
,
who
was
going
,
as
they
think
,
to
steal
some
gunpowder
:
 
five
hundred
men
are
lost
.
 
<EOS>
We
do
n't
yet
know
the
particulars
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
got
home
by
seven
,
and
am
going
to
be
busy
,
and
you
are
going
to
play
and
supper
<EOS>
;
you
live
ten
times
happier
than
I
;
but
I
should
live
ten
times
happier
than
you
if
I
were
with
MD
.
 
<EOS>
I
saw
Jemmy
Leigh
to
-
day
in
the
street
,
who
tells
me
that
Sterne
has
not
lain
above
once
these
three
weeks
in
his
lodgings
,
and
he
doubts
he
takes
ill
courses
;
he
stays
only
till
he
can
find
Sterne
to
go
along
with
him
,
and
he
can
not
hear
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
begged
him
to
inquire
about
the
box
when
he
comes
to
Chester
,
which
he
promises
.
  
<EOS>

.
 
<EOS>
The
Secretary
and
I
dined
to
-
day
with
Brigadier
Britton
,
a
great
friend
of
his
.
 
<EOS>
The
lady
of
the
house
is
very
gallant
,
about
thirty
-
five
;
she
is
said
to
have
a
great
deal
of
wit
;
but
I
see
nothing
among
any
of
them
that
equals
MD
by
a
bar
's
length
,
as
hope
saved
.
 
<EOS>
My
Lord
Treasurer
is
much
out
of
order
;
he
has
a
sore
throat
,
and
the
gravel
,
and
a
pain
in
his
breast
where
the
wound
was
:
 
pray
God
preserve
him
.
 
<EOS>
The
Queen
comes
to
Hampton
Court
on
Tuesday
next
;
people
are
coming
fast
to
town
,
and
I
must
answer
MD
's
letter
,
which
I
can
hardly
find
time
to
do
,
though
I
am
at
home
the
greatest
part
of
the
day
.
 
<EOS>
Lady
Betty
Germaine
and
I
were
disputing
Whig
and
Tory
to
death
this
morning
.
 
<EOS>
She
is
grown
very
fat
,
and
looks
mighty
well
.
 
<EOS>
Biddy
Floyd
was
there
,
and
she
is
,
I
think
,
very
much
spoiled
with
the
smallpox
.
  
<EOS>
18
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Treasurer
is
still
out
of
order
,
and
that
breaks
our
method
of
dining
there
to
-
day
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
often
subject
to
a
sore
throat
,
and
some
time
or
other
it
will
kill
him
,
unless
he
takes
more
care
than
he
is
apt
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
said
about
the
town
that
poor
Lord
Peterborow
was
dead
at
Frankfort
;
but
he
is
something
better
,
and
the
Queen
is
sending
him
to
Italy
,
where
I
hope
the
warm
climate
will
recover
him
:
 
he
has
abundance
of
excellent
qualities
,
and
we
love
one
another
mightily
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
this
afternoon
in
the
City
,
ate
a
bit
of
meat
,
and
settled
some
things
with
a
printer
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
answer
your
letter
on
Saturday
,
if
possible
,
and
then
send
away
this
;
so
to
fetch
up
the
odd
days
I
lost
at
Windsor
,
and
keep
constant
to
my
fortnight
.
 
<EOS>
Ombre
time
is
now
coming
on
,
and
we
shall
have
nothing
but
Manley
,
and
Walls
,
and
Stoytes
,
and
the
Dean
.
 
<EOS>
Have
you
got
no
new
acquaintance
?
 
<EOS>
Poor
girls
<EOS>
;
nobody
knows
MD
's
good
qualities
.
 
<EOS>
"
Tis
very
cold
;
but
I
will
not
have
a
fire
till
November
,
that
's
pozz
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
but
coming
home
to
-
night
,
I
found
on
my
table
a
letter
from
MD
;
<EOS>
faith
,
I
was
angry
,
that
is
,
with
myself
;
and
I
was
afraid
too
to
see
MD
's
hand
so
soon
,
for
fear
of
something
<EOS>
,
I
do
n't
know
what
:
 
<EOS>
at
last
I
opened
it
,
and
it
was
over
well
,
and
a
bill
for
the
two
hundred
guineas
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
'
tis
a
sad
thing
that
this
letter
is
not
gone
,
nor
your
twenty
-
first
answered
yet
.
  
<EOS>
19
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
invited
to
-
day
to
dine
with
Mrs.
Van
,
with
some
company
who
did
not
come
;
but
I
ate
nothing
but
herrings
;
you
must
know
I
hardly
ever
eat
of
above
one
thing
,
and
that
the
plainest
ordinary
meat
at
table
;
I
love
it
best
,
and
believe
it
wholesomest
.
 
<EOS>
You
love
rarities
;
yes
you
do
;
I
wish
you
had
all
that
I
ever
see
where
I
go
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
coming
home
early
,
and
met
the
Secretary
in
his
chair
,
who
persuaded
me
to
go
with
him
to
Britton
's
;
for
he
said
he
had
been
all
day
at
business
,
and
had
eaten
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
went
,
and
the
time
passed
so
,
that
we
stayed
till
two
,
so
you
may
believe
'
tis
late
enough
.
  
<EOS>

<EOS>
This
day
has
gone
all
wrong
,
by
sitting
up
so
late
last
night
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Treasurer
is
not
yet
well
,
and
ca
n't
go
to
Windsor
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
with
Sir
Matthew
Dudley
,
and
took
occasion
to
hint
to
him
that
he
would
lose
his
employment
,
for
which
I
am
very
sorry
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Pembroke
and
his
family
are
all
come
to
town
.
<EOS>
I
was
kept
so
long
at
a
friend
's
this
evening
that
I
can
not
send
this
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
When
I
knocked
at
my
lodgings
,
a
fellow
asked
me
where
lodged
Dr.
Swift
?
 
<EOS>
I
told
him
I
was
the
person
:
 
<EOS>
he
gave
me
a
letter
he
brought
from
the
Secretary
's
office
,
and
I
gave
him
a
shilling
:
 
<EOS>
when
I
came
up
,
I
saw
Dingley
's
hand
:
 
<EOS>
faith
,
I
was
afraid
,
I
do
not
know
what
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
it
was
a
formal
letter
,
from
Dingley
about
her
exchequer
business
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
I
'll
do
it
on
Monday
,
and
settle
it
with
Tooke
.
 
<EOS>
And
now
,
boys
,
for
your
letter
,
I
mean
the
first
,
N.21
.
 
<EOS>
Let
's
see
;
come
out
,
little
letter
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
had
the
letter
from
the
Bishop
that
Raymond
mentions
;
but
I
have
written
to
Ned
Southwell
,
to
desire
the
Duke
of
Ormond
to
speak
to
his
reverence
,
that
he
may
leave
off
his
impertinence
.
 
<EOS>
What
a
pox
can
they
think
I
am
doing
for
the
Archbishop
here
?
<EOS>
You
have
a
pretty
notion
of
me
in
Ireland
,
to
make
me
an
agent
for
the
Archbishop
of
Dublin
.
 
<EOS>
Why
!
<EOS>
do
you
think
I
value
your
people
's
ingratitude
about
my
part
in
serving
them
?
 
<EOS>
I
remit
them
their
first
-
fruits
of
ingratitude
,
as
freely
as
I
got
the
other
remitted
to
them
.
 
<EOS>
The
Lord
Treasurer
defers
writing
his
letter
to
them
,
or
else
they
would
be
plaguily
confounded
by
this
time
.
 
<EOS>
For
he
designs
to
give
the
merit
of
it
wholly
to
the
Queen
and
me
,
and
to
let
them
know
it
was
done
before
the
Duke
of
Ormond
was
Lord
Lieutenant
.
 
<EOS>
You
visit
,
you
dine
abroad
,
you
see
friends
;
you
pilgarlick
;
you
walk
from
Finglas
,
you
a
cat
's
foot
.
 
<EOS>
O
Lord
 
<EOS>
Lady
Gore
hung
her
child
by
the
WAIST
;
what
is
that
waist
?
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
understand
that
word
;
he
must
hang
on
till
you
explain
or
spell
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
believe
he
was
pretty
,
that
's
a
liiii
.
 
<EOS>
Pish
!
<EOS>
burn
your
First
-
Fruits
;
again
at
it
.
 
<EOS>
Stella
has
made
twenty
false
spellings
in
her
writing
;
I
'll
send
them
to
you
all
back
again
on
the
other
side
of
this
letter
,
to
mend
them
;
I
wo
n't
miss
one
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
I
think
there
were
seventeen
bishops
'
names
to
the
letter
Lord
Oxford
received
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
send
you
some
pamphlets
by
Leigh
;
put
me
in
mind
of
it
on
Monday
,
for
I
shall
go
then
to
the
printer
;
yes
,
and
the
Miscellany
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
mightily
obliged
to
Walls
,
but
I
do
n't
deserve
it
by
any
usage
of
him
here
,
having
seen
him
but
twice
,
and
once
en
passant
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Manley
forsworn
ombre
!
<EOS>
What
!
<EOS>
and
no
blazing
star
appear
?
<EOS>
no
monsters
born
?
<EOS>
no
whale
thrown
up
?
<EOS>
have
you
not
found
out
some
evasion
for
her
?
 
<EOS>
She
had
no
such
regard
to
oaths
in
her
younger
days
.
 
<EOS>
I
got
the
books
for
nothing
,
Madam
Dingley
;
but
the
wine
I
got
not
;
it
was
but
a
promise
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
my
head
is
pretty
well
in
the
main
,
only
now
<EOS>
and
then
a
little
threatening
or
so
.
 
<EOS>
You
talk
of
my
reconciling
some
great
folks
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
you
what
.
 
<EOS>
The
Secretary
told
me
last
night
that
he
had
found
the
reason
why
the
Queen
was
cold
to
him
for
some
months
past
;
that
a
friend
had
told
it
him
yesterday
;
and
it
was
,
that
they
suspected
he
was
at
the
bottom
with
the
Duke
of
Marlborough
.
 
<EOS>
Then
he
said
he
had
reflected
upon
all
I
had
spoken
to
him
long
ago
,
but
he
thought
it
had
only
been
my
suspicion
,
and
my
zeal
and
kindness
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
said
I
had
reason
to
take
that
very
ill
,
to
imagine
I
knew
so
little
of
the
world
as
to
talk
at
a
venture
to
a
great
Minister
;
that
I
had
gone
between
him
and
Lord
Treasurer
often
,
and
told
each
of
them
what
I
had
said
to
the
other
,
and
that
I
had
informed
him
so
before
.
 
<EOS>
He
said
all
that
you
may
imagine
to
excuse
himself
,
and
approve
my
conduct
.
 
<EOS>
I
told
him
I
knew
all
along
that
this
proceeding
of
mine
was
the
surest
way
to
send
me
back
to
my
willows
in
Ireland
,
but
that
I
regarded
it
not
,
provided
I
could
do
the
kingdom
service
in
keeping
them
well
together
.
 
<EOS>
I
minded
him
how
often
I
had
told
Lord
Treasurer
,
Lord
Keeper
,
and
him
together
,
that
all
things
depended
on
their
union
,
and
that
my
comfort
was
to
see
them
love
one
another
;
and
I
had
told
them
all
singly
that
I
had
not
said
this
by
chance
,
etc
.
<EOS>
He
was
in
a
rage
to
be
thus
suspected
;
swears
he
will
be
upon
a
better
foot
,
or
none
at
all
;
and
I
do
not
see
how
they
can
well
want
him
in
this
juncture
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
to
find
a
way
of
settling
this
matter
.
 
<EOS>
I
act
an
honest
part
,
that
will
bring
me
neither
honour
nor
praise
.
 
<EOS>
MD
must
think
the
better
of
me
for
it
:
 
nobody
else
shall
ever
know
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
Here
's
politics
enough
for
once
;
but
Madam
DD
gave
me
occasion
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
told
you
I
have
got
into
lodgings
that
do
n't
smell
ill
 
O
Lord
!
<EOS>
the
spectacles
:
 
<EOS>
well
,
I
'll
do
that
on
Monday
too
;
although
it
goes
against
me
to
be
employed
for
folks
that
neither
you
nor
I
care
a
groat
for
.
 
<EOS>
Is
the
eight
pounds
from
Hawkshaw
included
in
the
thirty
-
nine
pounds
five
shillings
and
twopence
?
 
<EOS>
How
do
I
know
by
this
how
my
account
stands
?
 
<EOS>
Ca
n't
you
write
five
or
six
lines
to
cast
it
up
?
 
<EOS>
Mine
is
forty
-
four
pounds
per
annum
,
and
eight
pounds
from
Hawkshaw
makes
fifty
-
two
pounds
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
set
it
right
,
and
let
me
know
;
you
had
best
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
now
I
have
answered
N.21
,
and
'
tis
late
,
and
I
will
answer
N.22
in
my
next
:
this
can
not
go
to
-
night
,
but
shall
on
Tuesday
:
 
and
so
go
to
your
play
,
and
lose
your
money
,
with
your
two
eggs
a
penny
;
silly
jade
;
you
witty
?
<EOS>
very
pretty
.

<EOS>
Mrs.
Van
would
have
me
dine
with
her
again
to
-
day
,
and
so
I
did
,
though
Lady
Mountjoy
has
sent
two
or
three
times
to
have
me
see
and
dine
with
her
,
and
she
is
a
little
body
I
love
very
well
.
 
<EOS>
My
head
has
ached
a
little
in
the
evenings
these
three
or
four
days
,
but
it
is
not
of
the
giddy
sort
,
so
I
do
not
much
value
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
to
see
Lord
Harley
to
-
day
,
but
Lord
Treasurer
took
physic
;
and
I
could
not
see
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
voided
much
gravel
,
and
is
better
,
but
not
well
:
 
<EOS>
he
talks
of
going
on
Tuesday
to
see
the
Queen
at
Hampton
Court
;
I
wish
he
may
be
able
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
saw
so
fine
a
summer
day
as
this
was
:
 
<EOS>
how
is
it
with
you
,
pray
?
<EOS>
and
ca
n't
you
remember
,
naughty
packs
?
 
<EOS>
I
han't
seen
Lord
Pembroke
yet
.
 
<EOS>
He
will
be
sorry
to
miss
Dilly
:
 
<EOS>
I
wonder
you
say
nothing
of
Dilly
's
being
got
to
Ireland
;
if
he
be
not
there
soon
,
I
shall
have
some
certain
odd
thoughts
:
 
guess
them
if
you
can
.
  
<EOS>
22
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
in
the
City
to
-
day
with
Dr.
Freind
,
at
one
of
my
printers
:
 
<EOS>
I
inquired
for
Leigh
,
but
could
not
find
him
:
 
<EOS>
I
have
forgot
what
sort
of
apron
you
want
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
rout
among
your
letters
,
a
needle
in
a
bottle
of
hay
.
 
<EOS>
I
gave
Sterne
directions
,
but
where
to
find
him
Lord
knows
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
bespoken
the
spectacles
;
got
a
set
of
Examiners
,
and
five
pamphlets
,
which
I
have
either
written
or
contributed
to
,
except
the
best
,
which
is
the
vindication
of
the
Duke
of
Marlborough
,
and
is
entirely
of
the
author
of
the
Atalantis
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
settled
Dingley
's
affair
with
Tooke
,
who
has
undertaken
it
,
and
understands
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
bespoken
a
Miscellany
:
 
<EOS>
what
would
you
have
me
do
more
?
 
<EOS>
It
cost
me
a
shilling
coming
home
;
it
rains
terribly
,
and
did
so
in
the
morning
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Treasurer
has
had
an
ill
day
,
in
much
pain
.
 
<EOS>
He
writes
and
does
business
in
his
chamber
<EOS>
now
he
is
ill
:
 
<EOS>
the
man
is
bewitched
:
 
he
desires
to
see
me
,
and
I
'll
maul
him
,
but
he
will
not
value
it
a
rush
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
half
weary
of
them
all
.
 
<EOS>
I
often
burst
out
into
these
thoughts
,
and
will
certainly
steal
away
as
soon
as
I
decently
can
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
many
friends
,
and
many
enemies
;
and
the
last
are
more
constant
in
their
nature
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
shuddering
at
all
to
think
of
retiring
to
my
old
circumstances
,
if
you
can
be
easy
;
but
I
will
always
live
in
Ireland
as
I
did
the
last
time
;
I
will
not
hunt
for
dinners
there
,
nor
converse
with
more
than
a
very
few
.
  
<EOS>
23
.
 
<EOS>
Morning
.
 
<EOS>
This
goes
to
-
day
,
and
shall
be
sealed
by
and
by
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Treasurer
takes
physic
again
to
-
day
:
 
<EOS>
I
believe
I
shall
dine
with
Lord
Dupplin
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Tooke
brought
me
a
letter
directed
for
me
at
Morphew
's
the
bookseller
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
,
by
the
postage
,
it
came
from
Ireland
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
a
woman
's
hand
,
and
seems
false
spelt
on
purpose
:
 
it
is
in
such
sort
of
verse
as
Harris
's
petition
;
rallies
me
for
writing
merry
things
,
and
not
upon
divinity
;
and
is
like
the
subject
of
the
Archbishop
's
last
letter
,
as
I
told
you
.
 
<EOS>
Can
you
guess
whom
it
came
from
?
 
<EOS>
It
is
not
ill
written
;
pray
find
it
out
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
a
Latin
verse
at
the
end
of
<EOS>
it
all
rightly
spelt
;
yet
the
English
,
as
I
think
,
affectedly
wrong
in
many
places
.
 
<EOS>
My
plaguing
time
is
coming
.
 
<EOS>
A
young
fellow
brought
me
a
letter
from
Judge
Coote
,
with
recommendation
to
be
lieutenant
of
a
man
-
of
-
war
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
the
son
of
one
Echlin
,
who
was
minister
of
Belfast
before
Tisdall
,
and
I
have
got
some
other
new
customers
;
but
I
shall
trouble
my
friends
as
little
as
possible
.
<EOS>
Saucy
Stella
used
to
jeer
me
for
meddling
with
other
folks
'
affairs
;
but
now
I
am
punished
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
Patrick
has
brought
the

I
have
no
more
room
.
<EOS>
Farewell

LETTER
33
.
 
<EOS>
LONDON
,
Oct.
23
,
1711
.
  
<EOS>
I
dined
with
Lord
Dupplin
as
I
told
you
I
would
,
and
put
my
thirty
-
second
into
the
post
-
office
my
own
self
;
and
I
believe
there
has
not
been
one
moment
since
we
parted
wherein
a
letter
was
not
upon
the
road
going
or
coming
to
or
from
PMD
.
 
<EOS>
If
the
Queen
knew
it
,
she
would
give
us
a
pension
;
for
it
is
we
bring
good
luck
to
their
post
-
boys
and
their
packets
;
else
they
would
break
their
necks
and
sink
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
an
old
saying
and
a
true
one
:
       
<EOS>
Be
it
snow
,
or
storm
,
or
hail
,
     
PMD
's
letters
never
fail
;
     
<EOS>
Cross
winds
may
sometimes
make
them
tarry
,
     
But
PMD
's
letters
ca
n't
miscarry
.
  
<EOS>
Terrible
rain
to
-
day
,
but
<EOS>
it
cleared
up
at
night
enough
to
save
my
twelvepence
coming
home
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Treasurer
is
much
better
this
evening
.
 
<EOS>
I
hate
to
have
him
ill
,
he
is
so
confoundedly
careless
.
 
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
answer
your
letter
yet
,
so
be
satisfied
.
  
<EOS>
24
.
 
<EOS>
I
called
at
Lord
Treasurer
's
to
-
day
at
noon
:
 
<EOS>
he
was
eating
some
broth
in
his
bed
-
chamber
,
undressed
,
with
a
thousand
papers
about
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
a
little
fever
upon
him
,
and
his
eye
terribly
bloodshot
;
yet
he
dressed
himself
and
went
out
to
the
Treasury
.
 
<EOS>
He
told
me
he
had
a
letter
from
a
lady
with
a
complaint
against
me
;
it
was
from
Mrs.
Cutts
,
a
sister
of
Lord
Cutts
,
who
writ
to
him
that
I
had
abused
her
brother
:
 
<EOS>
you
remember
the
"
Salamander
,
"
it
is
printed
in
the
Miscellany
.
 
<EOS>
I
told
my
lord
that
I
would
never
regard
complaints
,
and
that
I
expected
,
whenever
he
received
any
against
me
,
he
would
immediately
put
them
into
the
fire
,
and
forget
them
,
else
I
should
have
no
quiet
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
a
little
turn
in
my
head
this
morning
;
which
,
though
it
did
not
last
above
a
moment
,
yet
being
of
the
true
sort
,
has
made
me
as
weak
as
a
dog
all
this
day
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
<EOS>
the
first
I
have
had
this
half
-
year
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
take
my
pills
if
I
hear
of
it
again
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
at
Lady
Mountjoy
's
with
Harry
Coote
,
and
went
to
see
Lord
Pembroke
upon
his
coming
to
town
.
 
<EOS>
The
Whig
party
are
furious
against
a
peace
,
and
every
day
some
ballad
comes
out
reflecting
on
the
Ministry
on
that
account
.
 
<EOS>
The
Secretary
St.
John
has
seized
on
a
dozen
booksellers
and
publishers
into
his
messengers
'
hands
.
 
<EOS>
Some
of
the
foreign
Ministers
have
published
the
preliminaries
agreed
on
here
between
France
and
England
;
and
people
rail
at
them
as
insufficient
to
treat
a
peace
upon
;
but
the
secret
is
,
that
the
French
have
agreed
to
articles
much
more
important
,
which
our
Ministers
have
not
communicated
,
and
the
people
,
who
think
they
know
all
,
are
discontented
that
there
is
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
an
inconvenience
I
foretold
to
the
Secretary
,
but
we
could
contrive
no
way
to
fence
against
it
.
<EOS>
So
there
's
politics
for
you
.
  
<EOS>

<EOS>
The
Queen
is
at
Hampton
Court
:
 
<EOS>
she
went
on
Tuesday
in
that
terrible
rain
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
with
Lewis
at
his
lodgings
,
to
despatch
some
business
we
had
.
<EOS>
I
sent
this
morning
and
evening
to
Lord
Treasurer
,
and
he
is
much
worse
by
going
out
;
I
am
in
pain
about
evening
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
sent
for
Dr.
Radcliffe
;
pray
God
preserve
him
.
 
<EOS>
The
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
showed
me
to
-
day
a
ballad
in
manuscript
against
Lord
Treasurer
and
his
South
Sea
project
;
it
is
very
sharply
written
:
 
if
it
be
not
printed
,
I
will
send
it
you
.
 
<EOS>
If
it
be
,
it
shall
go
in
your
packet
of
pamphlets
.
 
<EOS>
I
found
out
your
letter
about
directions
for
the
apron
,
and
have
ordered
to
be
bought
a
cheap
green
silk
work
apron
;
I
have
it
by
heart
.
 
<EOS>
I
sat
this
evening
with
Mrs.
Barton
,
who
is
my
near
neighbour
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
delicious
day
,
and
I
got
my
walk
,
and
was
thinking
whether
MD
was
walking
too
just
at
that
time
that
Presto
was
.
<EOS>
This
paper
does
not
cost
me
a
farthing
,
I
have
it
from
the
Secretary
's
office
.
 
<EOS>
I
long
till
to
-
morrow
to
know
how
my
Lord
Treasurer
sleeps
this
night
,
and
to
hear
he
mends
:
 
we
are
all
undone
without
him
;
so
pray
for
him
,
sirrahs
,
and
do
n't
stay
too
late
at
the
Dean
's
.
  
<EOS>
26
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
with
Mrs.
Van
;
for
the
weather
is
so
bad
,
and
I
am
so
busy
,
that
I
ca
n't
dine
with
great
folks
:
 
and
besides
I
dare
eat
but
little
,
to
keep
my
head
in
order
,
which
is
better
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Treasurer
is
very
ill
,
but
I
hope
in
no
danger
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
no
quiet
with
the
Whigs
,
they
are
so
violent
against
a
peace
;
but
I
'll
cool
them
,
with
a
vengeance
,
very
soon
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
heard
from
the
Bishop
of
Clogher
,
whether
he
has
got
his
statues
.
 
<EOS>
I
writ
to
him
six
weeks
ago
;
he
's
so
busy
with
his
Parliament
.
 
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
answer
your
letter
yet
,
say
what
you
will
,
saucy
girls
.
  
<EOS>
27
.
 
<EOS>
I
forgot
to
go
about
some
business
this
morning
,
which
cost
me
double
the
time
;
and
<EOS>
I
was
forced
to
be
at
the
Secretary
's
office
till
four
,
and
lose
my
dinner
;
so
I
went
to
Mrs.
Van
's
,
and
made
them
get
me
three
herrings
,
which
I
am
very
fond
of
,
and
they
are
a
light
victuals
:
 
besides
<EOS>
,
I
was
to
have
supped
at
Lady
Ashburnham
's
;
but
the
drab
did
not
call
for
us
in
her
coach
,
as
she
promised
,
but
sent
for
us
,
and
so
I
sent
my
excuses
.
 
<EOS>
It
has
been
a
terrible
rainy
day
,
but
so
flattering
in
the
morning
,
that
I
would
needs
go
out
in
my
new
hat
.
 
<EOS>
I
met
Leigh
and
Sterne
as
I
was
going
into
the
Park
.
 
<EOS>
Leigh
says
he
will
go
to
Ireland
in
ten
days
,
if
he
can
get
Sterne
to
go
with
him
;
so
I
will
send
him
the
things
for
MD
,
and
I
have
desired
him
to
inquire
about
the
box
.
<EOS>
I
hate
that
Sterne
for
his
carelessness
about
it
;
but
it
was
my
fault
.
  
<EOS>
29
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
all
this
terrible
rainy
day
with
my
friend
Lewis
upon
business
of
importance
;
and
I
dined
with
him
,
and
came
home
about
seven
,
and
thought
I
would
amuse
myself
a
little
,
after
the
pains
I
had
taken
.
 
<EOS>
I
saw
a
volume
of
Congreve
's
plays
in
my
room
,
that
Patrick
had
taken
to
read
;
and
I
looked
into
it
,
and
in
mere
loitering
read
in
it
till
twelve
,
like
an
owl
and
a
fool
:
 
if
ever
<EOS>
I
do
so
again
;
never
saw
the
like
.
 
<EOS>
Count
Gallas
,
the
Emperor
's
Envoy
,
you
will
hear
,
is
in
disgrace
with
us
:
 
<EOS>
the
Queen
has
ordered
her
Ministers
to
have
no
more
commerce
with
him
;
the
reason
is
,
the
fool
writ
a
rude
letter
to
Lord
Dartmouth
,
Secretary
of
State
,
complaining
of
our
proceedings
about
a
peace
;
and
he
is
always
in
close
confidence
with
Lord
Wharton
and
Sunderland
,
and
others
of
the
late
Ministry
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
you
begin
to
think
there
will
be
no
peace
;
the
Whigs
here
are
sure
it
can
not
be
,
and
stocks
are
fallen
again
.
<EOS>
But
I
am
confident
there
will
,
unless
France
plays
us
tricks
;
and
you
may
venture
a
wager
with
any
of
your
Whig
acquaintance
that
we
shall
not
have
another
campaign
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
get
more
by
it
than
by
ombre
,
sirrah
.
 
<EOS>
I
let
slip
telling
you
yesterday
's
journal
,
which
I
thought
to
have
done
this
morning
,
but
blundered
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
yesterday
at
Harry
Coote
's
,
with
Lord
Hatton
,
Mr.
Finch
,
a
son
of
Lord
Nottingham
,
and
Sir
Andrew
Fountaine
.
 
<EOS>
I
left
them
soon
,
but
hear
they
stayed
till
two
in
the
morning
,
and
were
all
drunk
:
 
and
so
good
-
night
for
last
night
,
and
good
-
night
for
to
-
night
.
 
<EOS>
You
blundering
goosecap
,
an't
<EOS>
you
ashamed
to
blunder
to
young
ladies
?
 
<EOS>
I
shall
have
a
fire
in
three
or
four
days
now
,
<EOS>
oh
ho
.
  
<EOS>
30
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
to
-
day
in
the
City
concerting
some
things
with
a
printer
,
and
am
to
be
to
-
morrow
all
day
busy
with
Mr.
Secretary
about
the
same
.
 
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
tell
you
now
;
but
the
Ministers
reckon
it
will
do
abundance
of
good
,
and
open
the
eyes
of
the
nation
,
who
are
half
bewitched
against
a
peace
.
 
<EOS>
Few
of
this
generation
can
remember
anything
but
war
and
taxes
,
and
they
think
it
is
as
it
should
be
;
whereas
'
<EOS>
tis
certain
we
are
the
most
undone
people
in
Europe
,
as
I
am
afraid
I
shall
make
<EOS>
appear
beyond
all
contradiction
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
forgot
;
I
wo
n't
tell
you
what
I
will
do
,
nor
what
I
will
not
do
:
 
<EOS>
so
let
me
alone
,
and
go
to
Stoyte
,
and
give
Goody
Stoyte
and
Catherine
my
humble
service
<EOS>
;
I
love
Goody
Stoyte
better
than
Goody
Walls
.
 
<EOS>
Who
'll
pay
me
for
this
green
apron
?
 
<EOS>
I
will
have
the
money
;
it
cost
ten
shillings
and
sixpence
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
it
plaguy
dear
for
a
cheap
thing
;
but
they
said
that
English
silk
would
cockle
,
and
I
know
not
what
.
<EOS>
You
have
the
making
into
the
bargain
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
right
Italian
:
 
<EOS>
I
have
sent
it
and
the
pamphlets
to
Leigh
,
and
will
send
the
Miscellanies
and
spectacles
in
a
day
or
two
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
send
more
;
but
,
faith
,
I
'm
plaguy
poor
at
present
.
  
<EOS>
31
.
 
<EOS>
The
devil
's
in
this
Secretary
:
 
<EOS>
when
I
went
this
morning
he
had
people
with
him
;
but
says
he
,
"
we
are
to
dine
with
Prior
to
-
day
,
and
then
will
do
all
our
business
in
the
afternoon
"
:
 
at
two
,
Prior
sends
word
he
is
otherwise
engaged
;
then
the
Secretary
and
I
go
and
dine
with
Brigadier
Britton
,
sit
till
eight
,
grow
merry
,
no
business
done
;
he
is
in
haste
to
see
Lady
Jersey
;
we
part
,
and
appoint
no
time
to
meet
again
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
the
fault
of
all
the
present
Ministers
,
teasing
me
to
death
for
my
assistance
,
laying
the
whole
weight
of
their
affairs
upon
it
,
yet
slipping
opportunities
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Treasurer
mends
every
day
,
though
slowly
:
 
<EOS>
I
hope
he
will
take
care
of
himself
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
,
will
you
send
to
Parvisol
to
send
me
a
bill
of
twenty
pounds
as
soon
as
he
can
,
for
I
want
money
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
have
money
;
I
will
have
money
,
sirrahs
.
  
<EOS>
Nov.

.
 
<EOS>
I
went
to
-
day
into
the
City
to
settle
some
business
with
Stratford
,
and
to
dine
with
him
;
but
he
was
engaged
,
and
I
was
so
angry
I
would
not
dine
with
any
other
merchant
,
but
went
to
my
printer
,
and
ate
a
bit
,
and
did
business
of
mischief
with
him
,
and
I
shall
have
the
spectacles
and
Miscellany
to
-
morrow
,
and
leave
them
with
Leigh
.
 
<EOS>
A
fine
day
always
makes
me
go
into
the
City
,
if
I
can
spare
time
,
because
it
is
exercise
;
and
that
does
me
more
good
than
anything
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
heard
nothing
since
of
my
head
,
but
a
little
,
I
do
n't
know
<EOS>
how
,
sometimes
:
 
<EOS>
but
I
am
very
temperate
,
especially
now
the
Treasurer
is
ill
,
and
the
Ministers
often
at
Hampton
Court
,
and
the
Secretary
not
yet
fixed
in
his
house
,
and
I
hate
dining
with
many
of
my
old
acquaintance
.
 
<EOS>
Here
has
been
a
fellow
discovered
going
out
of
the
East
India
House
with
sixteen
thousand
pounds
in
money
and
bills
;
he
would
have
escaped
,
if
he
had
not
been
so
uneasy
with
thirst
,
that
he
stole
out
before
his
time
,
and
was
caught
.
 
<EOS>
But
what
is
that
to
MD
?
 
<EOS>
I
wish
we
had
the
money
,
provided
the
East
India
Company
was
never
the
worse
;
you
know
we
must
not
covet
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
Our
weather
,
for
this
fortnight
past
,
is
chequered
,
a
fair
and
a
rainy
day
:
 
<EOS>
this
was
very
fine
,
and
I
have
walked
four
miles
;
wish
MD
would
do
so
,
lazy
sluttikins
.
  
<EOS>

.
 
<EOS>
It
has
rained
all
day
with
a
continuendo
,
and
I
went
in
a
chair
to
dine
with
Mrs.
Van
;
always
there
in
a
very
rainy
day
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
made
a
shift
to
come
back
afoot
.
 
<EOS>
I
live
a
very
retired
life
,
pay
very
few
visits
,
and
keep
but
very
little
company
;
I
read
no
newspapers
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
sorry
I
sent
you
the
Examiner
,
<EOS>
for
the
printer
is
going
to
print
them
in
a
small
volume
:
 
<EOS>
it
seems
the
author
is
too
proud
to
have
them
printed
by
subscription
,
though
his
friends
offered
,
they
say
,
to
make
it
worth
five
hundred
pounds
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
The
Spectators
are
likewise
printing
in
a
larger
and
a
smaller
volume
,
so
I
believe
they
are
going
to
leave
them
off
,
and
indeed
people
grow
weary
of
them
,
though
they
are
often
prettily
written
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
had
no
news
for
me
to
send
you
now
towards
the
end
of
my
letter
.
 
<EOS>
The
Queen
has
the
gout
a
little
:
I
hoped
the
Lord
Treasurer
would
have
had
it
too
,
but
Radcliffe
told
me
yesterday
it
was
the
rheumatism
in
his
knee
and
foot
;
however
,
he
mends
,
and
I
hope
will
be
abroad
in
a
short
time
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
told
they
design
giving
away
several
employments
before
the
Parliament
sits
,
which
will
be
the
thirteenth
instant
.
 
<EOS>
I
either
do
not
like
,
or
not
understand
this
policy
;
and
if
Lord
Treasurer
does
not
mend
soon
,
they
must
give
them
just
before
the
session
.
<EOS>
But
he
is
the
greatest
procrastinator
in
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
3
.
 
<EOS>
A
fine
day
this
,
<EOS>
and
I
walked
a
pretty
deal
.
 
<EOS>
I
stuffed
the
Secretary
's
pockets
with
papers
,
which
he
must
read
and
settle
at
Hampton
Court
,
where
he
went
to
-
day
,
and
stays
some
time
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
no
lodgings
for
me
there
,
so
I
ca
n't
go
,
for
the
town
<EOS>
is
small
,
chargeable
,
and
inconvenient
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Treasurer
had
a
very
ill
night
last
night
,
with
much
pain
in
his
knee
and
foot
,
but
is
easier
to
-
day
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
I
went
to
visit
Prior
about
some
business
,
and
so
he
was
not
within
,
and
so
Sir
Andrew
Fountaine
made
me
dine
to
-
day
again
with
Mrs.
Van
,
and
<EOS>
I
came
home
soon
,
remembering
this
must
go
to
-
night
,
and
that
I
had
a
letter
of
MD
's
to
answer
.
 
<EOS>
O
Lord
,
where
is
it
?
<EOS>
let
me
see
;
so
,
so
,
here
it
is
.
 
<EOS>
You
grudge
writing
so
soon
.
 
<EOS>
Pox
on
that
bill
!
<EOS>
the
woman
would
have
me
manage
that
money
for
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
what
to
do
with
it
now
<EOS>
I
have
it
:
 
<EOS>
I
am
like
the
unprofitable
steward
in
the
Gospel
:
 
<EOS>
I
laid
it
up
in
a
napkin
;
there
thou
hast
what
is
thine
own
,
<EOS>
etc
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
well
,
I
know
of
your
new
Mayor
.
<EOS>
(
I
'll
tell
you
a
pun
:
 
a
fishmonger
owed
a
man
two
crowns
;
so
he
sent
him
a
piece
of
bad
ling
and
a
tench
,
and
then
said
he
was
paid
:
 
<EOS>
how
is
that
now
?
<EOS>
find
it
out
;
for
I
wo
n't
tell
it
you
:
 
<EOS>
which
of
you
finds
it
out
?
)
 
<EOS>
Well
,
but
as
I
was
saying
,
what
care
I
for
your
Mayor
?
 
<EOS>
I
fancy
Ford
may
tell
Forbes
right
about
my
returning
to
Ireland
before
Christmas
,
or
soon
after
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
sorry
you
did
not
go
on
with
your
story
about
Pray
God
<EOS>
you
be
John
;
I
never
heard
it
in
my
life
,
and
wonder
what
it
can
be
.
 
<EOS>
Ah
,
Stella
,
faith
,
you
leaned
upon
your
Bible
to
think
what
to
say
when
you
writ
that
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
that
story
of
the
Secretary
's
making
me
an
example
is
true
;
"
never
heard
it
before
;
"
why
,
how
could
you
hear
it
?
<EOS>
is
it
possible
to
tell
you
the
hundredth
part
of
what
passes
in
our
companies
here
?
 
<EOS>
The
Secretary
is
as
easy
with
me
as
Mr.
Addison
was
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
often
thought
what
a
splutter
Sir
William
Temple
makes
about
being
Secretary
of
State
:
 
<EOS>
I
think
Mr.
St.
John
the
greatest
young
man
I
ever
knew
;
wit
,
capacity
,
beauty
,
quickness
of
apprehension
,
good
learning
,
and
an
excellent
taste
;
the
best
orator
in
the
House
of
Commons
,
admirable
conversation
,
good
nature
,
and
good
manners
;
<EOS>
generous
,
and
a
despiser
of
money
.
 
<EOS>
His
only
fault
is
talking
to
his
friends
in
way
of
complaint
of
too
great
a
load
of
business
,
which
looks
a
little
like
affectation
;
and
he
endeavours
too
much
to
mix
the
fine
gentleman
and
man
of
pleasure
with
the
man
of
business
.
 
<EOS>
What
truth
and
sincerity
he
may
have
I
know
not
:
 
<EOS>
he
is
now
but
thirty
-
two
,
and
has
been
Secretary
above
a
year
.
 
<EOS>
Is
not
all
this
extraordinary
?
<EOS>
how
he
stands
with
the
Queen
and
Lord
Treasurer
<EOS>
I
have
told
you
before
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
his
character
;
and
I
believe
you
will
be
diverted
by
knowing
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
writ
to
the
Archbishop
of
Dublin
,
Bishop
of
Cloyne
and
of
Clogher
together
,
five
weeks
ago
from
Windsor
:
 
<EOS>
I
hope
they
had
my
letters
;
pray
know
if
Clogher
had
his
.
 
<EOS>
Fig
for
your
physician
and
his
advice
,
Madam
Dingley
:
 
<EOS>
if
I
grow
worse
,
I
will
;
otherwise
I
will
trust
to
temperance
and
exercise
:
 
your
fall
of
the
leaf
;
what
care
I
when
the
leaves
fall
?
 
<EOS>
I
am
sorry
to
see
them
fall
with
all
my
heart
;
but
why
should
I
take
physic
because
leaves
fall
off
from
trees
?
<EOS>
that
wo
n't
hinder
them
from
falling
.
 
<EOS>
If
a
man
falls
from
a
horse
,
must
I
take
physic
for
that
?
 
<EOS>
This
arguing
makes
you
mad
;
but
it
is
true
right
reason
,
not
to
be
disproved
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
glad
at
heart
to
hear
poor
Stella
is
better
;
use
exercise
and
walk
,
spend
pattens
and
spare
potions
,
wear
out
clogs
and
waste
claret
.
 
<EOS>
Have
you
found
out
my
pun
of
the
fishmonger
?
<EOS>
do
n't
read
a
word
more
till
you
have
got
it
.
 
<EOS>
And
Stella
is
handsome
again
,
you
say
?
<EOS>
and
is
she
fat
?
 
<EOS>
I
have
sent
to
Leigh
the
set
of
Examiners
:
 
<EOS>
the
first
thirteen
were
written
by
several
hands
,
some
good
,
some
bad
;
the
next
three
-
and
-
thirty
were
all
by
one
hand
,
that
makes
forty
-
six
:
 
then
that
author
,
whoever
he
was
,
laid
it
down
on
purpose
to
confound
guessers
;
and
the
last
six
were
written
by
a
woman
.
 
<EOS>
Then
there
is
an
account
of
Guiscard
by
the
same
woman
,
but
the
facts
sent
by
Presto
.
 
<EOS>
Then
an
answer
to
the
letter
to
the
Lords
about
Gregg
by
Presto
;
Prior
's
Journey
by
Presto
;
Vindication
of
the
Duke
of
Marlborough
,
entirely
by
the
same
woman
;
Comment
on
Hare
's
Sermon
by
the
same
woman
,
only
hints
sent
to
the
printer
from
Presto
to
give
her
.
 
<EOS>
Then
there
's
the
Miscellany
,
an
apron
for
Stella
,
a
pound
of
chocolate
,
without
sugar
,
for
Stella
,
a
fine
snuff
-
rasp
of
ivory
,
given
me
by
Mrs.
St.
John
for
Dingley
,
and
a
large
roll
of
tobacco
,
which
she
must
hide
or
cut
shorter
out
of
modesty
,
and
four
pair
of
spectacles
for
the
Lord
knows
who
.
 
<EOS>
There
's
the
cargo
<EOS>
,
I
hope
it
will
come
safe
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
Mrs.
Masham
and
I
are
very
well
;
we
write
to
one
another
,
but
it
is
upon
business
;
I
believe
I
told
you
so
before
:
 
pray
pardon
my
forgetfulness
in
these
cases
;
poor
Presto
ca
n't
help
it
.
 
<EOS>
MD
shall
have
the
money
as
soon
as
Tooke
gets
it
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
I
think
I
have
answered
all
,
and
the
paper
is
out
,
and
now
I
have
fetched
up
my
week
,
and
will
send
you
another
this
day
fortnight
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
you
rogues
,
two
crowns
make
TENCH
-
ILL
-
LING
:
 
<EOS>
you
are
so
dull
you
could
never
have
found
it
out
.
 
<EOS>
Farewell

LETTER

<EOS>
LONDON
,
Nov.
3
,
1711
.
  
<EOS>
My
thirty
-
third
lies
now
before
me
just
finished
,
and
I
am
going
to
seal
and
send
it
,
so
let
me
know
whether
you
would
have
me
add
anything
<EOS>
:
 
<EOS>
I
gave
you
my
journal
of
this
day
;
and
it
is
now
nine
at
night
,
and
I
am
going
to
be
busy
for
an
hour
or
two
.
  
<EOS>
4
.
 
<EOS>
I
left
a
friend
's
house
to
-
day
where
I
was
invited
,
just
when
dinner
was
setting
on
,
and
pretended
I
was
engaged
,
because
I
saw
some
fellows
I
did
not
know
;
and
went
to
Sir
Matthew
Dudley
's
,
where
I
had
the
same
inconvenience
,
but
he
would
not
let
me
go
;
otherwise
I
would
have
gone
home
,
and
sent
for
a
slice
of
mutton
and
a
pot
of
ale
,
rather
than
dine
with
persons
unknown
,
as
bad
,
for
aught
<EOS>
I
know
,
as
your
deans
,
parsons
,
and
curates
.
 
<EOS>
Bad
slabby
weather
to
-
day
.
 
<EOS>
Now
methinks
<EOS>
I
write
at
ease
,
when
I
have
no
letter
of
MD
's
to
answer
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
mistook
,
and
have
got
the
large
paper
.
 
<EOS>
The
Queen
is
laid
up
with
the
gout
at
Hampton
Court
:
 
<EOS>
she
is
now
seldom
without
it
any
long
time
together
;
I
fear
it
will
wear
her
out
in
a
very
few
years
.
 
<EOS>
I
plainly
find
I
have
less
twitchings
about
my
toes
since
these
Ministers
are
sick
and
out
of
town
,
and
that
I
do
n't
dine
with
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
compound
for
a
light
easy
gout
to
be
perfectly
well
in
my
head
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
walk
when
the
frost
comes
,
young
ladies
go
a
frost
-
biting
.
 
<EOS>
It
comes
into
my
head
,
that
,
from
the
very
time
you
first
went
to
Ireland
,
I
have
been
always
plying
you
to
walk
and
read
.
 
<EOS>
The
young
fellows
here
have
begun
a
kind
of
fashion
to
walk
,
and
many
of
them
have
got
swingeing
strong
shoes
on
purpose
;
it
has
got
as
far
as
several
young
lords
;
if
it
hold
,
it
would
be
a
very
good
thing
.
 
<EOS>
Lady
Lucy
and
I
are
fallen
out
;
she
rails
at
me
,
and
I
have
left
visiting
her
.
  
<EOS>
5
.
 
<EOS>
MD
was
very
troublesome
to
me
last
night
in
my
sleep
;
I
was
a
dreamed
,
methought
,
that
Stella
was
here
.
 
<EOS>
I
asked
her
after
Dingley
,
and
she
said
she
had
left
her
in
Ireland
,
because
she
designed
her
stay
to
be
short
,
and
such
stuff
.
 
<EOS>
Monsieur
Pontchartain
,
the
Secretary
of
State
in
France
,
and
Monsieur
Fontenelle
,
the
Secretary
of
the
Royal
Academy
there
(
who
writ
the
Dialogues
des
Morts
,
etc
.
)
,
have
sent
letters
to
Lord
Pembroke
that
the
Academy
have
,
with
the
King
's
consent
,
chosen
him
one
of
their
members
in
the
room
of
one
who
is
lately
dead
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
cautious
gentleman
has
given
me
the
letters
to
show
my
Lord
Dartmouth
and
Mr.
St.
John
,
our
two
Secretaries
,
and
let
them
see
there
is
no
treason
in
them
;
which
I
will
do
on
Wednesday
,
when
they
come
from
Hampton
Court
.
 
<EOS>
The
letters
are
very
handsome
,
and
it
is
a
very
great
mark
of
honour
and
distinction
to
Lord
Pembroke
.
 
<EOS>
I
hear
the
two
French
Ministers
are
come
over
again
about
the
peace
;
but
I
have
seen
nobody
of
consequence
to
know
the
truth
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
to
-
day
with
a
lady
of
my
acquaintance
,
who
was
sick
,
in
her
bed
-
chamber
,
upon
three
herrings
and
a
chicken
:
 
<EOS>
the
dinner
was
my
bespeaking
.
 
<EOS>
We
begin
now
to
have
chestnuts
and
Seville
oranges
;
have
you
the
latter
yet
?
 
<EOS>
'
Twas
a
terrible
windy
day
,
and
we
had
processions
in
carts
of
the
Pope
and
the
Devil
,
and
the
butchers
rang
their
cleavers
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
this
is
the
Fifth
of
November
,
Popery
and
gunpowder
.
  
<EOS>
6
.
 
<EOS>
Since
I
am
used
to
this
way
of
writing
,
I
fancy
<EOS>
I
could
hardly
make
out
a
long
letter
to
MD
without
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
ought
to
allow
for
every
line
taken
up
by
telling
you
where
I
dined
;
but
that
will
not
be
above
seven
lines
in
all
,
half
a
line
to
a
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
Your
Ingoldsby
is
going
over
,
and
they
say
here
he
is
to
be
made
a
lord
.
 
<EOS>
Here
was
I
staying
in
my
room
till
two
this
afternoon
for
that
puppy
Sir
Andrew
Fountaine
,
who
was
to
go
with
me
into
the
City
,
and
never
came
;
and
if
I
had
not
shot
a
dinner
flying
,
with
one
Mr.
Murray
,
I
might
have
fasted
,
or
gone
to
an
alehouse
.
 
<EOS>
You
never
said
one
word
of
Goody
Stoyte
in
your
letter
;
but
I
suppose
these
winter
nights
we
shall
hear
more
of
her
.
 
<EOS>
Does
the
Provost
laugh
as
much
as
he
used
to
do
?
 
<EOS>
We
reckon
him
here
a
good
-
for
-
nothing
fellow
.
 
<EOS>
I
design
to
write
to
your
Dean
one
of
these
days
,
but
I
can
never
find
time
,
nor
what
to
say
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
think
of
something
:
 
<EOS>
but
if
DD
were
not
in
Ireland
I
believe
seriously
I
should
not
think
of
the
place
twice
a
year
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
there
ever
makes
the
subject
of
talk
in
any
company
where
I
am
.
  
<EOS>
7
.
 
<EOS>
I
went
to
-
day
to
the
City
on
business
;
but
stopped
at
a
printer
's
,
and
stayed
there
:
 
<EOS>
it
was
a
most
delicious
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
hear
the
Parliament
is
to
be
prorogued
for
a
fortnight
longer
;
I
suppose
,
either
because
the
Queen
has
the
gout
,
or
that
Lord
Treasurer
is
not
well
,
or
that
they
would
do
something
more
towards
a
peace
.
 
<EOS>
I
called
at
Lord
Treasurer
's
at
noon
,
and
sat
a
while
with
Lord
Harley
,
but
his
father
was
asleep
.
 
<EOS>
A
bookseller
has
reprinted
or
new
-
titled
a
sermon
of
Tom
Swift
's
,
printed
last
year
,
and
publishes
an
advertisement
calling
it
Dr.
Swift
's
Sermon
.
 
<EOS>
Some
friend
of
Lord
Galway
has
,
by
his
directions
,
published
a
four
-
shilling
book
about
his
conduct
in
Spain
,
to
defend
him
;
I
have
but
just
seen
it
.
 
<EOS>
But
what
care
you
for
books
,
except
Presto
's
Miscellanies
?
 
<EOS>
Leigh
promised
to
call
and
see
me
,
but
has
not
yet
;
I
hope
he
will
take
care
of
his
cargo
,
and
get
your
Chester
box
.
 
<EOS>
A
murrain
take
that
box
!
<EOS>
everything
is
spoiled
that
is
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
How
does
the
strong
box
do
?
 
<EOS>
You
say
nothing
of
Raymond
:
 
<EOS>
is
his
wife
brought
to
bed
again
;
or
how
?
<EOS>
has
he
finished
his
house
;
paid
his
debts
;
and
put
out
the
rest
of
the
money
to
use
?
 
<EOS>
I
am
glad
to
hear
<EOS>
poor
Joe
is
like
to
get
his
two
hundred
pounds
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
Trim
is
now
reduced
to
slavery
again
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
glad
of
it
;
the
people
were
as
great
rascals
as
the
gentlemen
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
must
go
to
bed
,
sirrahs
<EOS>
:
the
Secretary
is
still
at
Hampton
Court
with
my
papers
,
or
is
come
only
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
They
plague
me
with
attending
them
.
  
<EOS>
8
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
with
the
Secretary
this
morning
,
and
we
dined
with
Prior
,
and
did
business
this
afternoon
till
about
eight
;
and
I
must
alter
and
undo
,
and
a
clutter
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
glad
the
Parliament
is
prorogued
.
 
<EOS>
I
stayed
with
Prior
till
eleven
;
the
Secretary
left
us
at
eight
.
 
<EOS>
Prior
,
I
believe
,
will
be
one
of
those
employed
to
make
the
peace
,
when
a
Congress
is
opened
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Ashburnham
told
to
-
day
at
the
Coffee
-
house
that
Lord
Harley
was
yesterday
morning
married
to
the
Duke
of
Newcastle
's
daughter
,
the
great
heiress
,
and
it
got
about
all
the
town
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
saw
Lord
Harley
yesterday
at
noon
in
his
nightgown
,
and
he
dined
in
the
City
with
Prior
and
others
;
so
it
is
not
true
;
but
I
hope
it
will
be
so
;
for
I
know
it
has
been
privately
managing
this
long
time
:
the
lady
will
not
have
half
her
father
's
estate
;
for
the
Duke
left
Lord
Pelham
's
son
his
heir
.
 
<EOS>
The
widow
Duchess
will
not
stand
to
the
will
,
and
she
is
now
at
law
with
Pelham
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
at
worst
,
the
girl
will
have
about
ten
thousand
pounds
a
year
to
support
the
honour
;
for
Lord
Treasurer
will
never
save
a
groat
for
himself
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Harley
is
a
very
valuable
young
gentleman
;
and
they
say
the
girl
is
handsome
,
and
has
good
sense
,
but
red
hair
.
  
<EOS>

.
 
<EOS>
I
designed
a
jaunt
into
the
City
to
-
day
to
be
merry
,
but
was
disappointed
;
so
one
always
is
in
this
life
;
and
I
could
not
see
Lord
Dartmouth
to
-
day
,
with
whom
I
had
some
business
.
 
<EOS>
Business
and
pleasure
both
disappointed
.
 
<EOS>
You
can
go
to
your
Dean
,
and
for
want
of
him
,
Goody
Stoyte
,
or
Walls
,
or
Manley
,
and
meet
everywhere
with
cards
and
claret
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
privately
with
a
friend
on
a
herring
and
chicken
,
and
half
a
flask
of
bad
Florence
.
 
<EOS>
I
begin
to
have
fires
now
,
when
the
mornings
are
cold
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
got
some
loose
bricks
at
the
back
of
my
grate
for
good
husbandry
.
 
<EOS>
Fine
weather
.
 
<EOS>
Patrick
tells
me
my
caps
are
wearing
out
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
not
how
to
get
others
.
 
<EOS>
I
want
a
necessary
woman
strangely
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
as
helpless
as
an
elephant
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
three
packets
from
the
Archbishop
of
Dublin
,
cost
me
four
shillings
,
all
about
Higgins
,
printed
stuff
,
and
two
long
letters
.
 
<EOS>
His
people
forgot
to
enclose
them
to
Lewis
;
and
they
were
only
directed
to
Doctor
Swift
,
without
naming
London
or
anything
else
.
 
<EOS>
I
wonder
how
they
reached
me
,
unless
the
postmaster
directed
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
read
all
the
trash
,
and
am
weary
.
  
<EOS>

.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
if
you
must
have
it
out
,
something
is
to
be
published
of
great
moment
,
and
three
or
four
great
people
are
to
see
there
are
no
mistakes
in
point
of
fact
:
 
and
'
tis
so
troublesome
to
send
it
among
them
,
and
get
their
corrections
,
that
I
am
weary
as
a
dog
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
to
-
day
with
the
printer
,
and
was
there
all
the
afternoon
;
and
it
plagues
me
,
and
there
's
an
end
,
and
what
would
you
have
?
 
<EOS>
Lady
Dupplin
,
Lord
Treasurer
's
daughter
,
is
brought
to
bed
of
a
son
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Treasurer
has
had
an
ugly
return
of
his
gravel
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
good
for
us
to
live
in
gravel
pits
,
but
not
for
gravel
pits
to
live
in
us
;
a
man
in
this
case
should
leave
no
stone
unturned
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Treasurer
's
sickness
,
the
Queen
's
gout
,
the
forwarding
the
peace
,
occasion
putting
off
the
Parliament
a
fortnight
longer
.
 
<EOS>
My
head
has
had
no
ill
returns
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
good
walking
to
-
day
in
the
City
,
and
take
all
opportunities
of
it
on
purpose
for
my
health
;
but
I
ca
n't
walk
in
the
Park
,
because
that
is
only
for
walking
's
sake
,
and
loses
time
,
so
I
mix
it
with
business
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
MD
walked
half
as
much
as
Presto
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
was
with
you
,
I
'd
make
you
walk
;
I
would
walk
behind
or
before
you
,
and
you
should
have
masks
on
,
and
be
tucked
up
like
anything
;
and
Stella
is
naturally
a
stout
walker
,
and
carries
herself
firm
;
methinks
I
see
her
strut
,
and
step
clever
over
a
kennel
;
and
Dingley
would
do
well
enough
if
her
petticoats
were
pinned
up
;
but
she
is
so
embroiled
,
and
so
fearful
,
<EOS>
and
then
Stella
scolds
,
and
Dingley
stumbles
,
and
is
so
daggled
.
 
<EOS>
Have
you
got
the
whalebone
petticoats
among
you
yet
?
 
<EOS>
I
hate
them
;
a
woman
here
may
hide
a
moderate
gallant
under
them
.
 
<EOS>
Pshaw
,
what
's
all
this
<EOS>
I
'm
saying
?
 
<EOS>
Methinks
I
am
talking
to
MD
face
to
face
.
  
<EOS>
11
.
 
<EOS>
Did
I
tell
you
that
old
Frowde
,
the
old
fool
,
is
selling
his
estate
at
Pepperhara
,
and
is
skulking
about
the
town
nobody
knows
where
?
<EOS>
and
who
do
you
think
manages
all
this
for
him
,
but
that
rogue
Child
,
the
double
squire
of
Farnham
?
 
<EOS>
I
have
put
Mrs.
Masham
,
the
Queen
's
favourite
,
upon
buying
it
,
but
that
is
yet
a
great
secret
;
and
I
have
employed
Lady
Oglethorpe
to
inquire
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
with
Lady
Oglethorpe
to
-
day
<EOS>
,
who
is
come
to
town
for
a
week
or
two
,
and
to
-
morrow
<EOS>
I
will
see
to
hunt
out
the
old
fool
:
 
he
is
utterly
ruined
,
and
at
this
present
in
some
blind
alley
with
some
dirty
wench
.
<EOS>
He
has
two
sons
that
must
starve
,
and
he
never
gives
them
a
farthing
.
 
<EOS>
If
Mrs.
Masham
buys
the
land
,
I
will
desire
her
to
get
the
Queen
to
give
some
pension
to
the
old
fool
,
to
keep
him
from
absolutely
starving
.
 
<EOS>
What
do
you
meddle
with
other
people
's
affairs
for
?
says
Stella
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
but
Mr.
Masham
and
his
wife
are
very
urgent
with
me
,
since
I
first
put
them
in
the
head
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
with
Sir
Matthew
Dudley
,
who
,
I
doubt
,
will
soon
lose
his
employment
.
  
<EOS>
12
.
 
<EOS>
Morning
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
going
to
hunt
out
old
Frowde
,
and
to
do
some
business
in
the
City
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
yet
called
to
Patrick
to
know
whether
it
be
fair
.
 
<EOS>
It
has
been
past
dropping
these
two
days
.
 
<EOS>
Rainy
weather
hurts
my
pate
and
my
purse
.
 
<EOS>
He
tells
me
'
tis
very
windy
,
and
begins
to
look
dark
;
woe
be
to
my
shillings
!
<EOS>
an
old
saying
and
a
true
,
       
Few
fillings
,
     
<EOS>
Many
shillings
.
  
<EOS>
If
the
day
be
dark
,
my
purse
will
be
light
.
       
<EOS>
To
my
enemies
be
this
curse
,
     
A
dark
day
and
a
light
purse
.
  
<EOS>
And
so
I
'll
rise
,
and
go
to
my
fire
,
for
Patrick
tells
me
I
have
a
fire
;
yet
it
is
not
shaving
-
day
,
nor
is
the
weather
cold
;
this
is
too
extravagant
.
 
<EOS>
What
is
become
of
Dilly
?
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
you
have
him
with
you
.
 
<EOS>
Stella
is
just
now
showing
a
white
leg
,
and
putting
it
into
the
slipper
.
 
<EOS>
Present
my
service
to
her
,
and
tell
her
I
am
engaged
to
the
Dean
,
and
desire
she
will
come
too
:
 
or
,
Dingley
,
ca
n't
you
write
a
note
?
 
<EOS>
This
is
Stella
's
morning
dialogue
,
no
,
morning
speech
I
mean
.
 
<EOS>
Morrow
,
sirrahs
,
and
let
me
rise
as
well
as
you
;
but
<EOS>
I
promise
you
Walls
ca
n't
dine
with
the
Dean
to
-
day
,
for
she
is
to
be
at
Mrs.
Proby
's
just
after
dinner
,
and
to
go
with
Gracy
Spencer
to
the
shops
to
buy
a
yard
of
muslin
,
and
a
silver
lace
for
an
under
petticoat
.
 
<EOS>
Morrow
again
,
sirrahs
.
 
<EOS>
At
night
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
with
Stratford
in
the
City
,
but
could
not
finish
my
affairs
with
him
;
but
now
I
am
resolved
to
buy
five
hundred
pounds
South
Sea
Stock
,
which
will
cost
me
three
hundred
and
eighty
ready
money
;
and
I
will
make
use
of
the
bill
of
a
hundred
pounds
you
sent
me
,
and
transfer
Mrs.
Walls
over
to
Hawkshaw
;
or
if
she
dislikes
it
,
I
will
borrow
a
hundred
pounds
of
the
Secretary
,
and
repay
her
.
 
<EOS>
Three
shillings
coach
-
hire
to
-
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
spoken
to
Frowde
's
brother
to
get
me
the
lowest
price
of
the
estate
,
to
tell
Mrs.
Masham
.
  
<EOS>
13
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
privately
with
a
friend
to
-
day
in
the
neighbourhood
.
 
<EOS>
Last
Saturday
night
I
came
home
,
and
the
drab
had
just
washed
my
room
,
and
my
bed
-
chamber
was
all
wet
,
and
I
was
forced
to
go
to
bed
in
my
own
defence
,
and
no
fire
:
 
<EOS>
I
was
sick
on
Sunday
,
and
now
have
got
a
swingeing
cold
.
 
<EOS>
I
scolded
like
a
dog
at
Patrick
,
although
he
was
out
with
me
:
 
<EOS>
I
detest
washing
of
rooms
;
ca
n't
they
wash
them
in
a
morning
,
and
make
a
fire
,
and
leave
open
the
windows
?
 
<EOS>
I
slept
not
a
wink
last
night
for
hawking
and
spitting
:
 
<EOS>
and
now
everybody
has
colds
.
 
<EOS>
Here
's
a
clutter
:
 
<EOS>
I
'll
go
to
bed
and
sleep
if
I
can
.
  
<EOS>

<EOS>
Lady
Mountjoy
sent
to
me
two
days
ago
,
so
I
dined
with
her
to
-
day
,
and
in
the
evening
went
to
see
Lord
Treasurer
.
 
<EOS>
I
found
Patrick
had
been
just
there
with
a
how
d'ye
,
and
my
lord
had
returned
answer
that
he
desired
to
see
me
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Masham
was
with
him
when
I
came
,
and
they
are
never
disturbed
:
 
'
tis
<EOS>
well
she
is
not
very
handsome
;
they
sit
alone
together
settling
the
nation
.
 
<EOS>
I
sat
with
Lady
Oxford
,
and
stopped
Mrs.
Masham
as
she
came
out
,
and
told
her
what
progress
I
had
made
,
etc
.
,
and
then
went
to
Lord
Treasurer
:
 
<EOS>
he
is
very
well
,
only
uneasy
at
rising
or
sitting
,
with
some
rheumatic
pain
in
his
thigh
,
and
a
foot
weak
.
 
<EOS>
He
showed
me
a
small
paper
,
sent
by
an
unknown
hand
to
one
Mr.
Cook
,
who
sent
it
to
my
lord
:
 
<EOS>
it
was
written
in
plain
large
letters
thus
       
"
<EOS>
Though
G####d
's
knife
did
not
succeed
,
      
<EOS>
A
F####n
's
yet
may
do
the
deed
.
"
  
<EOS>
And
a
little
below
:
 
"
BURN
THIS
,
YOU
DOG
.
"
 
<EOS>
My
lord
has
frequently
such
letters
as
these
:
 
once
he
showed
me
one
,
which
was
a
vision
describing
a
certain
man
,
his
dress
,
his
sword
,
and
his
countenance
,
who
was
to
murder
my
lord
.
 
<EOS>
And
he
told
me
he
saw
a
fellow
in
the
chapel
at
Windsor
with
a
dress
very
like
it
.
 
<EOS>
They
often
send
him
letters
signed
,
"
Your
humble
servant
,
The
Devil
,
"
and
such
stuff
.
 
<EOS>
I
sat
with
him
till
after
ten
,
and
have
business
to
do
.
  
<EOS>
15
.
 
<EOS>
The
Secretary
came
yesterday
to
town
from
Hampton
Court
,
so
I
went
to
him
early
this
morning
;
but
he
went
back
last
night
again
:
 
and
coming
home
to
-
night
<EOS>
I
found
a
letter
from
him
to
tell
me
that
he
was
just
come
from
Hampton
Court
,
and
just
returning
,
and
will
not
be
here
till
Saturday
night
.
 
<EOS>
A
pox
take
him
!
<EOS>
he
stops
all
my
business
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
beg
leave
to
come
back
when
I
have
got
over
this
,
and
hope
to
see
MD
in
Ireland
soon
after
Christmas
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
weary
of
Courts
,
and
want
my
journeys
to
Laracor
;
they
did
me
more
good
than
all
the
Ministries
these
twenty
years
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
to
-
day
in
the
City
,
but
did
no
business
as
I
designed
.
 
<EOS>
Lady
Mountjoy
tells
me
that
Dilly
is
got
to
Ireland
,
and
that
the
Archbishop
of
Dublin
was
the
cause
of
his
returning
so
soon
.
 
<EOS>
The
Parliament
was
prorogued
two
days
ago
for
a
fortnight
,
which
,
with
the
Queen
's
absence
,
makes
the
town
very
dull
and
empty
.
 
<EOS>
They
tell
me
the
Duke
of
Ormond
brings
all
the
world
away
with
him
from
Ireland
.
 
<EOS>
London
has
nothing
so
bad
in
it
in
winter
as
your
knots
of
Irish
folks
;
but
I
go
to
no
coffee
-
house
,
and
so
I
seldom
see
them
.
 
<EOS>
This
letter
shall
go
on
Saturday
;
and
then
I
am
even
with
the
world
again
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
lent
money
,
and
can
not
get
it
,
and
am
forced
to
borrow
for
myself
.
  
<EOS>

.
 
<EOS>
My
man
made
a
blunder
this
morning
,
and
let
up
a
visitor
,
when
I
had
ordered
to
see
nobody
;
so
I
was
forced
to
hurry
a
hang
-
dog
instrument
of
mine
into
my
bed
-
chamber
,
and
keep
him
cooling
his
heels
there
above
an
hour
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
going
on
fairly
in
the
common
forms
of
a
great
cold
;
I
believe
it
will
last
me
about
ten
days
in
all
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
have
told
you
,
that
in
those
two
verses
sent
to
Lord
Treasurer
,
G####d
stands
for
Guiscard
;
that
is
easy
;
but
we
differed
about
F####n
;
I
thought
it
was
for
Frenchman
,
because
he
hates
them
,
and
they
him
:
 
<EOS>
and
so
it
would
be
,
<EOS>
That
although
Guiscard
's
knife
missed
its
design
,
the
knife
of
a
Frenchman
might
yet
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
My
lord
thinks
it
stands
for
Felton
,
the
name
of
him
that
stabbed
the
first
Duke
of
Buckingham
.
<EOS>
Sir
Andrew
Fountaine
and
I
dined
with
the
Vans
to
-
day
,
and
my
cold
made
me
loiter
all
the
evening
.
 
<EOS>
Stay
,
young
women
,
do
n't
you
begin
to
owe
me
a
letter
?
<EOS>
just
a
month
to
-
day
since
I
had
your
N.22
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
stay
a
week
longer
,
and
then
,
I
'll
expect
like
agog
;
till
then
you
may
play
at
ombre
,
and
so
forth
,
as
you
please
.
 
<EOS>
The
Whigs
are
still
crying
down
our
peace
,
but
we
will
have
it
,
I
hope
,
in
spite
of
them
:
 
<EOS>
the
Emperor
comes
now
with
his
two
eggs
a
penny
,
and
promises
wonders
to
continue
the
war
;
but
it
is
too
late
;
only
I
hope
the
fear
of
it
will
serve
to
spur
on
the
French
to
be
easy
and
sincere
:
  
Night
,
sirrahs
;
I
'll
go
early
to
bed
.
  
<EOS>
17
.
 
<EOS>
Morning
.
 
<EOS>
This
goes
to
-
night
;
I
will
put
it
myself
in
the
post
-
office
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
just
now
a
long
letter
from
the
Archbishop
of
Dublin
,
giving
me
an
account
of
the
ending
your
session
<EOS>
,
how
it
ended
in
a
storm
;
which
storm
,
by
the
time
it
arrives
here
,
will
be
only
half
nature
.
 
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
help
it
,
I
wo
n't
hide
.
 
<EOS>
I
often
advised
the
dissolution
of
that
Parliament
,
although
I
did
not
think
the
scoundrels
had
so
much
courage
;
but
they
have
it
only
in
the
wrong
,
like
a
bully
that
will
fight
for
a
whore
,
and
run
away
in
an
army
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
,
by
several
things
the
Archbishop
says
,
he
is
not
very
well
either
with
the
Government
or
clergy
.
 
<EOS>
See
how
luckily
my
paper
ends
with
a
fortnight
.
 
<EOS>
God
Almighty
bless
and
preserve
dearest
little
MD
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
your
Lord
Lieutenant
is
now
setting
out
for
England
.
 
<EOS>
I
wonder
the
Bishop
of
Clogher
does
not
write
to
me
,
or
let
me
know
of
his
statues
,
and
how
he
likes
them
:
 
I
will
write
to
him
again
,
as
soon
as
I
have
leisure
.
 
<EOS>
Farewell
,
dearest
MD
,
and
love
Presto
,
who
loves
MD
infinitely
above
all
earthly
things
,
and
who
will
.
 
<EOS>
My
service
to
Mrs.
Stoyte
and
Catherine

<EOS>
I
'm
sitting
in
my
bed
,
but
will
rise
to
seal
this

<EOS>
Morrow
,
dear
rogues
:
 
Farewell
again

dearest
MD

LETTER
35
.
 
<EOS>
LONDON
,
NOV
.
17
,
1711
.
  
<EOS>
I
put
my
last
this
evening
in
the
post
-
office
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
with
Dr.
Cockburn
.
<EOS>
This
being
Queen
Elizabeth
's
birthday
,
we
have
the
D
#
#
#
#
and
all
to
do
among
us
.
 
<EOS>
I
just
heard
of
the
stir
as
my
letter
was
sealed
this
morning
,
and
was
so
cross
I
would
not
open
it
to
tell
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
visiting
Lady
Oglethorpe
and
Lady
Worsley
;
the
latter
is
lately
come
to
town
for
the
winter
,
and
with
child
,
and
what
care
you
?
 
<EOS>
This
is
Queen
Elizabeth
's
birthday
,
usually
kept
in
this
town
by
apprentices
,
etc
.
<EOS>
;
but
the
Whigs
designed
a
mighty
procession
by
midnight
,
and
had
laid
out
a
thousand
pounds
to
dress
up
the
Pope
,
Devil
,
cardinals
,
Sacheverell
,
etc
.
,
and
carry
them
with
torches
about
,
and
burn
them
.
 
<EOS>
They
did
it
by
contribution
.
 
<EOS>
Garth
gave
five
guineas
;
Dr.
Garth
I
mean
,
if
ever
you
heard
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
But
they
were
seized
last
night
,
by
order
from
the
Secretary
:
 
<EOS>
you
will
have
an
account
of
it
,
for
they
bawl
it
about
the
streets
already
.
 
<EOS>
They
had
some
very
foolish
and
mischievous
designs
;
and
it
was
thought
they
would
have
put
the
rabble
upon
assaulting
my
Lord
Treasurer
's
house
and
the
Secretary
's
,
and
other
violences
.
<EOS>
The
militia
was
raised
to
prevent
it
,
and
now
,
I
suppose
,
all
will
be
quiet
.
<EOS>
The
figures
are
now
at
the
Secretary
's
office
at
Whitehall
.
 
<EOS>
I
design
to
see
them
if
I
can
.
  
<EOS>
18
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
this
morning
with
Mr.
Secretary
,
who
just
came
from
Hampton
Court
.
<EOS>
He
was
telling
me
more
particulars
about
this
business
of
burning
the
Pope
.
<EOS>
It
cost
a
great
deal
of
money
,
and
had
it
gone
on
,
would
have
cost
three
times
as
much
;
but
the
town
is
full
of
it
,
and
half
a
dozen
Grub
Street
papers
already
.
 
<EOS>
The
Secretary
and
I
dined
at
Brigadier
Britton
's
,
but
I
left
them
at
six
,
upon
an
appointment
with
some
sober
company
of
men
and
ladies
,
to
drink
punch
at
Sir
Andrew
Fountaine
's
.
 
<EOS>
We
were
not
very
merry
;
and
I
do
n't
love
rack
punch
<EOS>
,
I
love
it
better
with
brandy
;
are
you
of
my
opinion
?
 
<EOS>
Why
then
,
twelvepenny
weather
;
sirrahs
,
why
do
n't
you
play
at
shuttlecock
?
 
<EOS>
I
have
thought
of
it
a
hundred
times
;
faith
,
Presto
will
come
over
after
Christmas
,
and
will
play
with
Stella
before
the
cold
weather
is
gone
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
read
the
Spectators
?
 
<EOS>
I
never
do
;
they
never
come
in
my
way
;
I
go
to
no
coffee
-
houses
.
<EOS>
They
say
abundance
of
them
are
very
pretty
;
they
are
going
to
be
printed
in
small
volumes
;
I
'll
bring
them
over
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
be
out
of
my
hurry
in
a
week
,
and
if
Leigh
be
not
gone
over
,
I
will
send
you
by
him
what
I
am
now
finishing
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
where
Leigh
is
;
I
have
not
seen
him
this
good
<EOS>
while
,
though
he
promised
to
call
:
 
I
shall
send
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
The
Queen
comes
to
town
on
Thursday
for
good
and
all
.
  
<EOS>
19
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
this
morning
at
Lord
Dartmouth
's
office
,
and
sent
out
for
him
from
the
Committee
of
Council
,
about
some
business
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
asking
him
more
concerning
this
bustle
about
the
figures
in
wax
-
work
of
the
Pope
,
and
Devil
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
not
at
leisure
,
or
he
would
have
seen
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
hear
the
owners
are
so
impudent
,
that
they
design
to
replevin
them
by
law
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
assured
that
the
figure
of
the
Devil
is
made
as
like
Lord
Treasurer
as
they
could
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
I
dined
with
a
friend
in
St.
James
's
Street
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Treasurer
,
I
am
told
,
was
abroad
to
-
day
;
I
will
know
to
-
morrow
<EOS>
how
he
does
after
it
.
 
<EOS>
The
Duke
of
Marlborough
is
come
,
and
was
yesterday
at
Hampton
Court
with
the
Queen
;
no
,
it
was
t'other
day
;
no
,
it
was
yesterday
;
for
to
-
day
I
remember
Mr.
Secretary
was
going
to
see
him
,
when
I
was
there
,
not
at
the
Duke
of
Marlborough
's
,
but
at
the
Secretary
's
;
the
Duke
is
not
so
fond
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
What
care
I
?
 
<EOS>
I
won
seven
shillings
to
-
night
at
picquet
:
 
<EOS>
I
play
twice
a
year
or
so
.
  
<EOS>
20
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
so
teased
with
Whiggish
discourse
by
Mrs.
Barton
and
Lady
Betty
Germaine
,
never
saw
the
like
.
 
<EOS>
They
turn
all
this
affair
of
the
Pope
-
burning
into
ridicule
;
and
,
indeed
,
they
have
made
too
great
a
clutter
about
it
,
if
they
had
no
real
reason
to
apprehend
some
tumults
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
with
Lady
Betty
.
 
<EOS>
I
hear
Prior
's
commission
is
passed
to
be
Ambassador
Extraordinary
and
Plenipotentiary
for
the
peace
;
my
Lord
Privy
Seal
,
who
you
know
is
Bishop
of
Bristol
,
is
the
other
;
and
Lord
Strafford
,
already
Ambassador
at
The
Hague
,
the
third
:
 
I
am
forced
to
tell
you
,
ignorant
sluts
,
who
is
who
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
punning
scurvily
with
Sir
Andrew
Fountaine
and
Lord
Pembroke
this
evening
:
 
<EOS>
do
you
ever
pun
now
?
 
<EOS>
Sometimes
with
the
Dean
,
or
Tom
Leigh
.
 
<EOS>
Prior
puns
very
well
.
 
<EOS>
Odso
,
I
must
go
see
His
Excellency
,
'
tis
a
noble
advancement
:
 
<EOS>
but
they
could
do
no
less
,
after
sending
him
to
France
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Strafford
is
as
proud
as
Hell
,
and
how
he
will
bear
one
of
Prior
's
mean
birth
on
an
equal
character
with
him
,
I
know
not
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
I
go
to
my
business
,
and
bid
you
good
-
night
.
  
<EOS>
21
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
this
morning
busy
with
my
printer
:
 
<EOS>
I
gave
him
the
fifth
sheet
,
and
then
I
went
and
dined
with
him
in
the
City
,
to
correct
something
,
and
alter
,
etc
.
,
and
I
walked
home
in
the
dusk
,
and
the
rain
overtook
me
:
 
<EOS>
and
I
found
a
letter
here
from
Mr.
Lewis
;
<EOS>
well
,
and
so
I
opened
it
;
and
he
says
the
peace
is
past
danger
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
<EOS>
and
so
there
was
another
letter
enclosed
in
his
:
 
<EOS>
well
,
and
so
I
looked
on
the
outside
of
this
t'other
letter
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
and
so
who
do
you
think
this
t'other
letter
was
from
?
 
<EOS>
Well
,
and
so
I
'll
tell
you
;
it
was
from
little
MD
,
N.23
,
23
,
23
,
23
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
you
it
is
no
more
,
I
have
told
you
so
before
:
 
<EOS>
but
I
just
looked
again
to
satisfy
you
.
 
<EOS>
Hie
,
Stella
,
you
write
like
an
emperor
,
a
great
deal
together
;
a
very
good
hand
,
and
but
four
false
spellings
in
all
.
 
<EOS>
Shall
I
send
them
to
you
?
 
<EOS>
I
am
glad
you
did
not
take
my
correction
ill
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
but
I
wo
n't
answer
your
letter
now
,
sirrah
saucyboxes
,
no
,
no
;
not
yet
;
just
a
month
and
three
days
from
the
last
,
which
is
just
five
weeks
:
<EOS>
you
see
it
comes
just
when
I
begin
to
grumble
.
  
<EOS>
22
.
 
<EOS>
Morning
.
 
<EOS>
Tooke
has
just
brought
me
Dingley
's
money
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
give
you
a
note
for
it
at
the
end
of
this
letter
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
half
a
crown
for
entering
the
letter
of
attorney
;
but
I
swore
to
stop
that
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
spend
your
money
bravely
here
.
 
<EOS>
Morrow
,
dear
sirrahs
.
 
<EOS>
At
night
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
to
-
day
with
Sir
Thomas
Hanmer
;
his
wife
,
the
Duchess
of
Grafton
,
dined
with
us
:
 
<EOS>
she
wears
a
great
high
head
-
dress
,
such
as
was
in
fashion
fifteen
years
ago
,
and
looks
like
a
mad
woman
in
it
;
yet
she
has
great
remains
of
beauty
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
this
evening
to
see
Lord
Harley
,
and
thought
to
have
sat
with
Lord
Treasurer
,
but
he
was
taken
up
with
the
Dutch
Envoy
and
such
folks
;
and
I
would
not
stay
.
<EOS>
One
particular
in
life
here
,
different
from
what
I
have
in
Dublin
,
is
,
that
whenever
I
come
home
I
expect
to
find
some
letter
for
me
,
and
seldom
miss
;
and
never
any
worth
a
farthing
,
but
often
to
vex
me
.
 
<EOS>
The
Queen
does
not
come
to
town
till
Saturday
.
 
<EOS>
Prior
is
not
yet
declared
;
but
these
Ministers
being
at
Hampton
Court
<EOS>
,
I
know
nothing
;
and
if
I
write
news
from
common
hands
,
it
is
always
lies
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
think
it
affectation
;
but
nothing
has
vexed
me
more
for
some
months
past
,
than
people
I
never
saw
pretending
to
be
acquainted
with
me
,
and
yet
speak
ill
of
me
too
;
at
least
some
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
An
old
crooked
Scotch
countess
,
whom
I
never
heard
of
in
my
life
,
told
the
Duchess
of
Hamilton
t'other
day
that
I
often
visited
her
.
 
<EOS>
People
of
worth
never
do
that
;
so
that
a
man
only
gets
the
scandal
of
having
scurvy
acquaintance
.
 
<EOS>
Three
ladies
were
railing
against
me
some
time
ago
,
and
said
they
were
very
well
acquainted
with
me
;
two
of
which
I
had
never
heard
of
,
and
the
third
I
had
only
seen
twice
where
I
happened
to
visit
.
 
<EOS>
A
man
who
has
once
seen
me
in
a
coffee
-
house
will
ask
me
how
I
do
,
when
he
sees
me
talking
at
Court
with
a
Minister
of
State
;
who
is
sure
to
ask
me
how
I
came
acquainted
with
that
scoundrel
.
 
<EOS>
But
come
,
sirrahs
,
this
is
all
stuff
to
you
,
so
I
'll
say
no
more
on
this
side
the
paper
,
but
turn
over
.
  
<EOS>
23
.
 
<EOS>
My
printer
invited
Mr.
Lewis
and
me
to
dine
at
a
tavern
to
-
day
,
which
I
have
not
done
five
times
since
I
came
to
England
;
I
never
will
call
it
Britain
,
pray
do
n't
call
it
Britain
.
 
<EOS>
My
week
is
not
out
,
and
one
side
of
this
paper
is
out
,
and
I
have
a
letter
to
answer
of
MD
's
into
the
bargain
:
 
<EOS>
must
I
write
on
the
third
side
?
<EOS>
faith
,
that
will
give
you
an
ill
habit
.
 
<EOS>
I
saw
Leigh
last
night
:
 
<EOS>
he
gives
a
terrible
account
of
Sterne
;
he
reckons
he
is
seduced
by
some
wench
;
he
is
over
head
and
ears
in
debt
,
and
has
pawned
several
things
.
 
<EOS>
Leigh
says
he
goes
on
Monday
next
for
Ireland
,
but
believes
Sterne
will
not
go
with
him
;
Sterne
has
kept
him
these
three
months
.
 
<EOS>
Leigh
has
got
the
apron
and
things
,
and
promises
to
call
for
the
box
at
Chester
;
but
I
despair
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
Good
-
night
,
sirrahs
;
I
have
been
late
abroad
.
  
<EOS>
24
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
finished
my
pamphlet
to
-
day
,
which
has
cost
me
so
much
time
and
trouble
:
 
it
will
be
published
in
three
or
four
days
,
when
the
Parliament
begins
sitting
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
the
Queen
is
come
to
town
,
but
know
nothing
,
having
been
in
the
City
finishing
and
correcting
with
the
printer
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
came
home
,
I
found
letters
on
my
table
as
usual
,
and
one
from
your
mother
,
to
tell
me
that
you
desire
your
writings
and
a
picture
should
be
sent
to
me
,
to
be
sent
over
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
just
answered
her
letter
,
and
promised
to
take
care
of
them
if
they
be
sent
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
She
is
at
Farnham
:
 
<EOS>
it
is
too
late
to
send
them
by
Leigh
;
besides
,
I
will
wait
your
orders
,
Madam
Stella
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
going
to
finish
a
letter
to
Lord
Treasurer
about
reforming
our
language
;
but
first
I
must
put
an
end
to
a
ballad
;
and
go
you
to
your
cards
,
sirrahs
,
this
is
card
season
.
  
<EOS>
25
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
early
with
the
Secretary
to
-
day
,
but
he
was
gone
to
his
devotions
,
and
to
receive
the
sacrament
:
 
<EOS>
several
rakes
did
the
same
;
it
was
not
for
piety
,
but
employments
;
according
to
Act
of
Parliament
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
with
Lady
Mary
Dudley
;
and
passed
my
time
since
insipidly
,
only
I
was
at
Court
at
noon
,
and
saw
fifty
acquaintance
<EOS>
I
had
not
met
this
long
time
:
 
<EOS>
that
is
the
advantage
of
a
Court
,
and
I
fancy
<EOS>
I
am
better
known
than
any
man
that
goes
there
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
John
Walter
's
quarrel
with
me
has
entertained
the
town
ever
since
;
and
yet
we
never
had
a
word
,
only
he
railed
at
me
behind
my
back
.
 
<EOS>
The
Parliament
is
again
to
be
prorogued
for
eight
or
nine
days
,
for
the
Whigs
are
too
strong
in
the
House
of
Lords
:
 
<EOS>
other
reasons
are
pretended
,
but
that
is
the
truth
.
 
<EOS>
The
prorogation
is
not
yet
known
,
but
will
be
to
-
morrow
.
  
<EOS>

<EOS>
Mr.
Lewis
and
I
dined
with
a
friend
of
his
,
and
unexpectedly
there
dined
with
us
an
Irish
knight
,
one
Sir
John
St.
Leger
,
who
follows
the
law
here
,
but
at
a
great
distance
:
 
<EOS>
he
was
so
pert
,
I
was
forced
to
take
him
down
more
than
once
.
 
<EOS>
I
saw
to
-
day
<EOS>
the
Pope
,
and
Devil
,
and
the
other
figures
of
cardinals
,
etc
.
,
fifteen
in
all
,
which
have
made
such
a
noise
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
put
an
under
-
strapper
upon
writing
a
twopenny
pamphlet
to
give
an
account
of
the
whole
design
.
 
<EOS>
My
large
pamphlet
will
be
published
to
-
morrow
;
copies
are
sent
to
the
great
men
this
night
.
 
<EOS>
Domville
is
come
home
from
his
travels
;
I
am
vexed
at
it
:
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
seen
him
yet
;
I
design
to
present
him
to
all
the
great
men
.
  
<EOS>
27
.
 
<EOS>
Domville
came
to
me
this
morning
,
and
we
dined
at
Pontack
's
,
and
were
all
day
together
,
till
six
this
evening
:
 
<EOS>
he
is
perfectly
as
fine
<EOS>
a
gentleman
as
I
know
<EOS>
;
he
set
me
down
at
Lord
Treasurer
's
,
with
whom
I
stayed
about
an
hour
,
till
Monsieur
Buys
,
the
Dutch
Envoy
,
came
to
him
about
business
.
 
<EOS>
My
Lord
Treasurer
is
pretty
well
,
but
stiff
in
the
hips
with
the
remains
of
the
rheumatism
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
to
bring
Domville
to
my
Lord
Harley
in
a
day
or
two
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
the
dirtiest
rainy
day
that
ever
I
saw
.
 
<EOS>
The
pamphlet
is
published
;
Lord
Treasurer
had
it
by
him
on
the
table
,
and
was
asking
me
about
the
mottoes
in
the
title
-
page
;
he
gave
me
one
of
them
himself
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
send
you
the
pamphlet
,
if
I
can
.
  
<EOS>

<EOS>
Mrs.
Van
sent
to
me
to
dine
with
her
to
-
day
,
because
some
ladies
of
my
acquaintance
were
to
be
there
;
and
there
I
dined
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
this
morning
to
return
Domville
his
visit
,
and
went
to
visit
Mrs.
Masham
,
who
was
not
within
.
<EOS>
I
am
turned
out
of
my
lodging
by
my
landlady
:
 
it
seems
her
husband
and
her
son
are
coming
home
;
but
I
have
taken
another
lodging
hard
by
,
in
Leicester
Fields
.
 
<EOS>
I
presented
Mr.
Domville
to
Mr.
Lewis
and
Mr.
Prior
this
morning
.
<EOS>
Prior
<EOS>
and
I
are
called
the
two
Sosias
,
in
a
Whig
newspaper
.
 
<EOS>
Sosias
,
can
you
read
it
?
 
<EOS>
The
pamphlet
begins
to
make
a
noise
:
 
<EOS>
I
was
asked
by
several
whether
I
had
seen
it
,
and
they
advised
me
to
read
it
,
for
it
was
something
very
extraordinary
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
be
suspected
;
and
it
will
have
several
paltry
answers
.
 
<EOS>
It
must
take
its
fate
,
as
Savage
said
of
his
sermon
that
he
preached
at
Farnham
on
Sir
William
Temple
's
death
.
 
<EOS>
Domville
saw
Savage
in
Italy
,
and
says
he
is
a
coxcomb
,
and
half
mad
:
 
he
goes
in
red
,
and
with
yellow
waistcoats
,
and
was
at
ceremony
kneeling
to
the
Pope
on
a
Palm
Sunday
,
which
is
much
more
than
kissing
his
toe
;
and
I
believe
it
will
ruin
him
here
when
'
tis
told
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
answer
your
letter
in
my
new
lodgings
:
 
<EOS>
I
have
hardly
room
;
I
must
borrow
from
the
other
side
.
  
<EOS>

New
lodgings

<EOS>
My
printer
came
this
morning
to
tell
me
he
must
immediately
print
a
second
edition
,
and
Lord
Treasurer
made
one
or
two
small
additions
:
 
they
must
work
day
and
night
to
have
it
out
on
Saturday
;
they
sold
a
thousand
in
two
days
.
 
<EOS>
Our
Society
met
to
-
day
;
nine
of
us
were
present
:
 
<EOS>
we
dined
at
our
brother
Bathurst
's
.
 
<EOS>
We
made
several
regulations
,
and
have
chosen
three
new
members
,
Lord
Orrery
,
Jack
Hill
,
who
is
Mrs.
Masham
's
brother
,
he
that
lately
miscarried
in
the
expedition
to
Quebec
,
and
one
Colonel
Disney
.
 
<EOS>
W
e
have
taken
a
room
in
a
house
near
St.
James
's
to
meet
in
.
 
<EOS>
I
left
them
early
about
correcting
the
pamphlet
,
etc
.
,
and
am
now
got
home
,
etc
.
  
<EOS>
30
.
 
<EOS>
This
morning
I
carried
Domville
to
see
my
Lord
Harley
,
and
I
did
some
business
with
Lord
Treasurer
,
and
have
been
all
this
afternoon
with
the
printer
,
adding
something
to
the
second
edition
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
with
the
printer
:
the
pamphlet
makes
a
world
of
noise
,
and
will
do
a
great
deal
of
good
;
it
tells
abundance
of
most
important
facts
which
were
not
at
all
known
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
answer
your
letter
to
-
morrow
morning
;
or
suppose
I
answer
it
just
now
,
though
it
is
pretty
late
.
 
<EOS>
Come
then
.
 
<EOS>
You
say
you
are
busy
with
Parliaments
,
etc
.
<EOS>
;
that
's
more
than
ever
<EOS>
I
will
be
when
I
come
back
;
but
you
will
have
none
these
two
years
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Santry
,
etc
.
<EOS>
,
yes
,
I
have
had
enough
on't
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
glad
Dilly
is
mended
;
does
not
he
thank
me
for
showing
him
the
Court
and
the
great
people
's
faces
?
 
<EOS>
He
had
his
glass
out
at
the
Queen
and
the
rest
.
 
<EOS>
'
<EOS>
Tis
right
what
Dilly
says
:
 
I
depend
upon
nothing
from
my
friends
,
but
to
go
back
as
I
came
.
 
<EOS>
Never
fear
Laracor
,
'
twill
mend
with
a
peace
,
or
surely
they
'll
give
me
the
Dublin
parish
.
 
<EOS>
Stella
is
in
the
right
:
 
the
Bishop
of
Ossory
is
the
silliest
,
best
-
natured
wretch
breathing
,
of
as
little
consequence
as
an
egg
-
shell
.
<EOS>
Well
,
the
spelling
I
have
mentioned
before
;
only
the
next
time
say
AT
LEAST
,
and
not
AT
LEST
.
 
<EOS>
Pox
on
your
Newbury
!
<EOS>
what
can
I
do
for
him
?
 
<EOS>
I
'll
give
his
case
<EOS>
(
I
am
glad
it
is
not
a
woman
's
)
to
what
members
I
know
;
that
's
all
I
can
do
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Treasurer
's
lameness
goes
off
daily
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
<EOS>
God
preserve
poor
good
Mrs.
Stoyte
;
she
would
be
a
great
loss
to
us
all
:
 
pray
give
her
my
service
,
and
tell
her
she
has
my
heartiest
prayers
.
 
<EOS>
I
pity
poor
Mrs.
Manley
;
but
I
think
the
child
is
happy
to
die
,
considering
how
little
provision
it
would
have
had
.
 
<EOS>
Poh
,
every
pamphlet
abuses
me
,
and
for
things
that
I
never
writ
.
 
<EOS>
Joe
should
have
written
me
thanks
for
his
two
hundred
pounds
:
 
<EOS>
I
reckon
he
got
it
by
my
means
;
and
I
must
thank
the
Duke
of
Ormond
,
who
I
dare
swear
<EOS>
will
say
he
did
it
on
my
account
.
 
<EOS>
Are
they
golden
pippins
,
those
seven
apples
?
 
<EOS>
We
have
had
much
rain
every
day
as
well
as
you
.
 
<EOS>
7
pounds
,
17
shillings
,
8
pence
,
old
blunderer
,
not
18
shillings
:
 
<EOS>
I
have
reckoned
it
eighteen
times
.
 
<EOS>
Hawkshaw
's
eight
pounds
is
not
reckoned
and
if
it
be
secure
,
it
may
lie
where
it
is
,
unless
they
desire
to
pay
it
:
 
<EOS>
so
Parvisol
may
let
it
drop
till
further
orders
;
for
I
have
put
Mrs.
Wesley
's
money
into
the
Bank
,
and
will
pay
her
with
Hawkshaw
's
.
 
<EOS>
I
mean
that
Hawkshaw
's
money
goes
for
an
addition
to
MD
,
you
know
;
but
be
good
housewives
.
 
<EOS>
Bernage
never
comes
now
to
see
me
;
he
has
no
more
to
ask
;
but
I
hear
he
has
been
ill
.
 
<EOS>
A
pox
on
Mrs.
South
's
affair
;
I
can
do
nothing
in
it
,
but
by
way
of
assisting
anybody
else
that
solicits
it
,
by
dropping
a
favourable
word
,
if
it
comes
in
my
way
.
<EOS>
Tell
Walls
I
do
no
more
for
anybody
with
my
Lord
Treasurer
,
especially
a
thing
of
this
kind
.
 
<EOS>
Tell
him
I
have
spent
all
my
discretion
,
and
have
no
more
to
use
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
I
have
answered
your
letter
fully
and
plainly
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
I
have
got
to
the
third
side
of
my
paper
,
which
is
more
than
belongs
to
you

young
women

O

I

methought
I
was
speaking

dearest

face
to
face

There

so

enough

<EOS>
Pish
,
sirrahs
,
put
a
date
always
at
the
bottom
of
your
letter
,
as
well
as
the
top
,
that
I
may
know
when
you
send
it
;
your
last
is
of
November
3
,
yet
I
had
others
at
the
same
time
,
written
a
fortnight
after
.
 
<EOS>
Whenever
you
would
have
any
money
,
send
me
word
three
weeks
before
,
and
in
that
time
you
will
certainly
have
an
answer
,
with
a
bill
on
Parvisol
:
 
<EOS>
pray
do
this
;
for
my
head
is
full
,
and
it
will
ease
my
memory
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
I
think
I
quoted
to
you
some
of
#
#
#
#
"
s
letter
,
so
you
may
imagine
how
witty
the
rest
was
;
for
it
was
all
of
a
bunch
,
as
Goodman
Peesley
says
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
let
us
have
no
more
bussiness
,
but
busyness
:
 
<EOS>
the
deuce
take
me
if
I
know
how
to
spell
it
;
your
wrong
spelling
,
Madam
Stella
,
has
put
me
out
:
 
<EOS>
it
does
not
look
right
;
let
me
see
,
bussiness
,
busyness
,
business
,
bisyness
,
bisness
,
bysness
;
faith
,
I
know
not
which
is
right
<EOS>
,
I
think
the
second
;
I
believe
I
never
writ
the
word
in
my
life
before
;
yes
,
sure
I
must
,
though
;
business
,
busyness
,
bisyness
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
perplexed
myself
,
and
ca
n't
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
Prithee
ask
Walls
.
 
<EOS>
Business
,
I
fancy
that
's
right
.
<EOS>
Yes
it
is
;
I
looked
in
my
own
pamphlet
,
and
found
it
twice
in
ten
lines
,
to
convince
you
that
I
never
writ
it
before
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
now
I
see
it
as
plain
as
can
be
;
so
yours
is
only
an
s
too
much
.
 
<EOS>
The
Parliament
will
certainly
meet
on
Friday
next
:
 
the
Whigs
will
have
a
great
majority
in
the
House
of
Lords
,
no
care
is
taken
to
prevent
it
;
there
is
too
much
neglect
;
they
are
warned
of
it
,
and
that
signifies
nothing
:
 
<EOS>
it
was
feared
there
would
be
some
peevish
address
from
the
Lords
against
a
peace
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
said
about
the
town
that
several
of
the
Allies
begin
now
to
be
content
that
a
peace
should
be
treated
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
all
the
news
I
have
.
 
<EOS>
The
Queen
is
pretty
well
:
 
and
so
now
I
bid
poor
dearest
MD
farewell
till
to
-
night
;
then
I
will
talk
with
them
again
.
  
<EOS>
The
fifteen
images
that
I
saw
were
not
worth
forty
pounds
,
so
I
stretched
a
little
when
I
said
a
thousand
.
 
<EOS>
The
Grub
Street
account
of
that
tumult
is
published
.
 
<EOS>
The
Devil
is
not
like
Lord
Treasurer
:
 
<EOS>
they
were
all
in
your
odd
antic
masks
,
bought
in
common
shops
.
 
<EOS>
I
fear
Prior
will
not
be
one
of
the
plenipotentiaries
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
looking
over
this
letter
,
and
find
I
make
many
mistakes
of
leaving
out
words
<EOS>
;
so
'
tis
impossible
to
find
my
meaning
,
unless
you
be
conjurers
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
take
more
care
for
the
future
,
and
read
over
every
day
just
what
I
have
written
that
day
,
which
will
take
up
no
time
to
speak
of

LETTER
36
.
 
<EOS>
LONDON
,
Dec.
1
,
1711
.
  
<EOS>
My
last
was
put
in
this
evening
.
 
<EOS>
I
intended
to
dine
with
Mr.
Masham
to
-
day
,
and
called
at
White
's
chocolate
house
to
see
if
he
was
there
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Wharton
saw
me
at
the
door
,
and
I
saw
him
,
but
took
no
notice
,
and
was
going
away
,
but
he
came
through
the
crowd
,
called
after
me
,
and
asked
me
how
I
did
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
pretty
;
and
I
believe
he
wished
every
word
he
spoke
was
a
halter
to
hang
me
.
 
<EOS>
Masham
did
not
dine
at
home
,
so
I
ate
with
a
friend
in
the
neighbourhood
.
<EOS>
The
printer
has
not
sent
me
the
second
edition
;
I
know
not
the
reason
,
for
it
certainly
came
out
to
-
day
;
perhaps
they
are
glutted
with
it
already
.
 
<EOS>
I
found
a
letter
from
Lord
Harley
on
my
table
,
to
tell
me
that
his
father
desires
I
would
make
two
small
alterations
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
going
to
be
busy
,
etc
.

.
 
Morning
.
 
<EOS>
See
the
blunder
;
I
was
making
it
the
37th
day
of
the
month
,
from
the
number
above
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
but
I
am
staying
here
for
old
Frowde
,
who
appointed
to
call
this
morning
:
 
<EOS>
I
am
ready
dressed
to
go
to
church
:
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
he
dare
not
stir
out
but
on
Sundays
.
 
<EOS>
The
printer
called
early
this
morning
,
told
me
the
second
edition
went
off
yesterday
in
five
hours
,
and
he
must
have
a
third
ready
to
-
morrow
,
for
they
might
have
sold
half
another
:
 
his
men
are
all
at
work
with
it
,
though
it
be
Sunday
.
 
<EOS>
This
old
fool
will
not
come
,
and
I
shall
miss
church
.
 
<EOS>
Morrow

<EOS>
At
night
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
at
Court
to
-
day
:
 
<EOS>
the
Queen
is
well
,
and
walked
through
part
of
the
rooms
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
with
the
Secretary
,
and
despatched
some
business
.
 
<EOS>
He
tells
me
the
Dutch
Envoy
designs
to
complain
of
that
pamphlet
.
 
<EOS>
The
noise
it
makes
is
extraordinary
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
fit
it
should
answer
the
pains
I
have
been
at
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
it
will
be
printed
in
Ireland
.
 
<EOS>
Some
lay
it
to
Prior
,
others
to
Mr.
Secretary
St.
John
,
but
I
am
always
the
first
they
lay
everything
to
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
go
sleep
,
etc
.
  
<EOS>

.
 
<EOS>
I
have
ordered
Patrick
not
to
let
any
odd
fellow
come
up
to
me
;
and
a
fellow
would
needs
speak
with
me
from
Sir
George
Pretyman
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
never
heard
of
him
,
and
would
not
see
the
messenger
:
 
but
at
last
it
proved
that
this
Sir
George
has
sold
his
estate
,
and
is
a
beggar
.
 
<EOS>
Smithers
,
the
Farnham
carrier
,
brought
me
this
morning
a
letter
from
your
mother
,
with
three
papers
enclosed
of
Lady
Giffard
's
writing
;
one
owning
some
exchequer
business
of
100
pounds
to
be
Stella
's
;
another
for
100
pounds
that
she
has
of
yours
,
which
I
made
over
to
you
for
Mariston
;
and
a
third
for
300
pounds
;
the
last
is
on
stamped
paper
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
they
had
better
lie
in
England
in
some
good
hand
till
Lady
Giffard
dies
;
and
I
will
think
of
some
such
hand
before
I
come
over
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
asking
Smithers
about
all
the
people
of
Farnham
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
White
has
left
off
dressing
,
is
troubled
with
lameness
and
swelled
legs
,
and
seldom
stirs
out
;
but
her
old
hang
-
dog
husband
as
hearty
as
ever
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
this
morning
with
Lord
Treasurer
,
about
something
he
would
have
altered
in
the
pamphlet
;
but
it
ca
n't
be
till
the
fourth
edition
,
which
I
believe
will
be
soon
;
for
I
dined
with
the
printer
,
and
he
tells
me
they
have
sold
off
half
the
third
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Perceval
and
her
daughter
have
been
in
town
these
three
weeks
,
which
I
never
heard
till
to
-
day
;
and
Mrs.
Wesley
is
come
to
town
too
,
to
consult
Dr.
Radcliffe
.
 
<EOS>
The
Whigs
are
resolved
to
bring
that
pamphlet
into
the
House
of
Lords
to
have
it
condemned
,
so
I
hear
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
printer
will
stand
to
it
,
and
not
own
the
author
;
he
must
say
he
had
it
from
the
penny
-
post
.
 
<EOS>
Some
people
talk
as
if
the
House
of
Lords
would
do
some
peevish
thing
,
for
the
Whigs
are
now
a
great
majority
in
it
;
our
Ministers
are
too
negligent
of
such
things
:
 
<EOS>
I
have
never
slipped
giving
them
warning
;
some
of
them
are
sensible
of
it
;
but
Lord
Treasurer
stands
too
much
upon
his
own
legs
.
 
<EOS>
I
fancy
his
good
fortune
will
bear
him
out
in
everything
;
but
in
reason
I
should
think
this
Ministry
to
stand
very
unsteady
;
if
they
can
carry
a
peace
,
they
may
hold
;
I
believe
not
else
.

<EOS>
Mr.
Secretary
sent
to
me
to
-
day
to
dine
with
him
alone
;
but
we
had
two
more
with
us
,
which
hindered
me
doing
some
business
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
this
morning
with
young
Harcourt
,
secretary
to
our
Society
,
to
take
a
room
for
our
weekly
meetings
;
and
the
fellow
asked
us
five
guineas
a
week
only
to
have
leave
to
dine
once
a
week
;
was
not
that
pretty
?
<EOS>
so
we
broke
off
with
him
,
and
are
to
dine
next
Thursday
at
Harcourt
's
(
he
is
Lord
Keeper
's
son
)
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
sold
off
above
half
the
third
edition
,
and
answers
are
coming
out
:
 
<EOS>
the
Dutch
Envoy
refused
dining
with
Dr.
Davenant
,
because
he
was
suspected
to
write
it
:
 
<EOS>
I
have
made
some
alterations
in
every
edition
,
and
it
has
cost
me
more
trouble
,
for
the
time
,
since
the
printing
,
than
before
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
sent
over
to
Ireland
,
and
I
suppose
you
will
have
it
reprinted
.
  
<EOS>
5
.
 
<EOS>
They
are
now
printing
the
fourth
edition
,
which
is
reckoned
very
extraordinary
,
considering
'
tis
a
dear
twelvepenny
book
,
and
not
bought
up
in
numbers
by
the
party
to
give
away
,
as
the
Whigs
do
,
but
purely
upon
its
own
strength
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
got
an
under
spur
-
leather
to
write
an
Examiner
again
,
and
the
Secretary
and
I
will
now
and
then
send
hints
;
but
we
would
have
it
a
little
upon
the
Grub
Street
,
to
be
a
match
for
their
writers
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
with
Lord
Treasurer
to
-
day
at
five
:
 
<EOS>
he
dined
by
himself
after
his
family
,
and
drinks
no
claret
yet
,
for
fear
of
his
rheumatism
,
of
which
he
is
almost
well
.
<EOS>
He
was
very
pleasant
,
as
he
is
always
:
 
yet
I
fancied
he
was
a
little
touched
with
the
present
posture
of
affairs
.
 
<EOS>
The
Elector
of
Hanover
's
Minister
here
has
given
in
a
violent
memorial
against
the
peace
,
and
caused
it
to
be
printed
.
 
<EOS>
The
Whig
lords
are
doing
their
utmost
for
a
majority
against
Friday
,
and
design
,
if
they
can
,
to
address
the
Queen
against
the
peace
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Nottingham
,
a
famous
Tory
and
speech
-
maker
,
is
gone
over
to
the
Whig
side
:
they
toast
him
daily
,
and
Lord
Wharton
says
,
It
is
Dismal
<EOS>
(
so
they
call
him
from
his
looks
)
will
save
England
at
last
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Treasurer
was
hinting
as
if
he
wished
a
ballad
was
made
on
him
,
and
I
will
get
up
one
against
to-
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
He
gave
me
a
scurrilous
printed
paper
of
bad
verses
on
himself
,
under
the
name
of
the
English
Catiline
,
and
made
me
read
them
to
the
company
.
<EOS>
It
was
his
birthday
,
which
he
would
not
tell
us
,
but
Lord
Harley
whispered
it
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
6
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
this
morning
making
the
ballad
<EOS>
,
two
degrees
above
Grub
Street
:
 
at
noon
I
paid
a
visit
to
Mrs.
Masham
,
and
then
went
to
dine
with
our
Society
.
<EOS>
Poor
Lord
Keeper
dined
below
stairs
,
I
suppose
,
on
a
bit
of
mutton
.
 
<EOS>
We
chose
two
members
:
 
<EOS>
we
were
eleven
met
,
the
greatest
meeting
we
ever
had
:
 
<EOS>
I
am
next
week
to
introduce
Lord
Orrery
.
 
<EOS>
The
printer
came
before
we
parted
,
and
brought
the
ballad
,
which
made
them
laugh
very
heartily
a
dozen
times
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
going
to
print
the
pamphlet
in
small
,
a
fifth
edition
,
to
be
taken
off
by
friends
,
and
sent
into
the
country
.
 
<EOS>
A
sixpenny
answer
is
come
out
,
good
for
nothing
,
but
guessing
me
,
among
others
,
for
the
author
.
 
<EOS>
To
-
morrow
is
the
fatal
day
for
the
Parliament
meeting
,
and
we
are
full
of
hopes
and
fears
.
 
<EOS>
We
reckon
we
have
a
majority
of
ten
on
our
side
in
the
House
of
Lords
;
yet
I
observed
Mrs.
Masham
<EOS>
a
little
uneasy
:
 
<EOS>
she
assures
me
<EOS>
the
Queen
is
stout
.
 
<EOS>
The
Duke
of
Marlborough
has
not
seen
the
Queen
for
some
days
past
;
Mrs.
Masham
is
glad
of
it
,
because
she
says
he
tells
a
hundred
lies
to
his
friends
of
what
she
says
to
him
:
 
he
is
one
day
humble
,
and
the
next
day
on
the
high
ropes
.
 
<EOS>
The
Duke
of
Ormond
,
they
say
,
will
be
in
town
to
-
night
by
twelve
.
  
<EOS>

.
 
<EOS>
This
being
the
day
the
Parliament
was
to
meet
,
and
the
great
question
to
be
determined
,
I
went
with
Dr.
Freind
to
dine
in
the
City
,
on
purpose
to
be
out
of
the
way
,
and
we
sent
our
printer
to
see
what
was
our
fate
;
but
he
gave
us
a
most
melancholy
account
of
things
.
 
<EOS>
The
Earl
of
Nottingham
began
,
and
spoke
against
a
peace
,
and
desired
that
in
their
address
they
might
put
in
a
clause
to
advise
the
Queen
not
to
make
a
peace
without
Spain
;
which
was
debated
,
and
carried
by
the
Whigs
by
about
six
voices
:
 
and
this
has
happened
entirely
by
my
Lord
Treasurer
's
neglect
,
who
did
not
take
timely
care
to
make
up
all
his
strength
,
although
every
one
of
us
gave
him
caution
enough
.
<EOS>
Nottingham
has
certainly
been
bribed
.
 
<EOS>
The
question
is
yet
only
carried
in
the
Committee
of
the
whole
House
,
and
we
hope
when
it
is
reported
to
the
House
to
-
morrow
,
we
shall
have
a
majority
,
by
some
Scotch
lords
coming
to
town
.
<EOS>
However
,
it
is
a
mighty
blow
and
loss
of
reputation
to
Lord
Treasurer
,
and
may
end
in
his
ruin
.
 
<EOS>
I
hear
the
thing
only
as
the
printer
brought
it
,
who
was
at
the
debate
;
but
how
the
Ministry
take
it
,
or
what
their
hopes
and
fears
are
,
<EOS>
I
can
not
tell
until
I
see
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
be
early
with
the
Secretary
to
-
morrow
,
and
then
I
will
tell
you
more
,
and
shall
write
a
full
account
to
the
Bishop
of
Clogher
to
-
morrow
,
and
to
the
Archbishop
of
Dublin
,
if
I
have
time
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
horribly
down
at
present
.
 
<EOS>
I
long
to
know
how
Lord
Treasurer
bears
this
,
and
what
remedy
he
has
.
 
<EOS>
The
Duke
of
Ormond
came
this
day
to
town
,
and
was
there
.
  
<EOS>
8
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
early
this
morning
with
the
Secretary
,
and
talked
over
this
matter
.
<EOS>
He
hoped
that
when
it
was
reported
this
day
in
the
House
of
Lords
,
they
would
disagree
with
their
Committee
,
and
so
the
matter
would
go
off
,
only
with
a
little
loss
of
reputation
to
the
Lord
Treasurer
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
with
Mr.
Cockburn
,
and
after
,
a
Scotch
member
came
in
,
and
told
us
that
the
clause
was
carried
against
the
Court
in
the
House
of
Lords
almost
two
to
one
.
 
<EOS>
I
went
immediately
to
Mrs.
Masham
,
and
meeting
Dr.
Arbuthnot
(
the
Queen
's
favourite
physician
)
,
we
went
together
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
just
come
from
waiting
at
the
Queen
's
dinner
,
and
going
to
her
own
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
heard
nothing
of
the
thing
being
gone
against
us
.
<EOS>
It
seems
Lord
Treasurer
had
been
so
negligent
that
he
was
with
the
Queen
while
the
question
was
put
in
the
House
:
 
I
immediately
told
Mrs.
Masham
that
either
she
and
Lord
Treasurer
had
joined
with
the
Queen
to
betray
us
,
or
that
they
two
were
betrayed
by
the
Queen
:
 
<EOS>
she
protested
solemnly
it
was
not
the
former
,
and
I
believed
her
;
but
she
gave
me
some
lights
to
suspect
the
Queen
is
changed
.
 
<EOS>
For
yesterday
,
when
the
Queen
was
going
from
the
House
,
where
she
sat
to
hear
the
debate
,
the
Duke
of
Shrewsbury
,
Lord
Chamberlain
,
asked
her
whether
he
or
the
Great
Chamberlain
Lindsey
ought
to
lead
her
out
;
she
answered
short
,
"
Neither
of
you
,
"
and
gave
her
hand
to
the
Duke
of
Somerset
,
who
was
louder
than
any
in
the
House
for
the
clause
against
peace
.
 
<EOS>
She
gave
me
one
or
two
more
instances
of
this
sort
,
which
convince
me
that
the
Queen
is
false
,
or
at
least
very
much
wavering
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Masham
begged
us
to
stay
,
because
Lord
Treasurer
would
call
,
and
we
were
resolved
to
fall
on
him
about
his
negligence
in
securing
a
majority
.
 
<EOS>
He
came
,
and
appeared
in
good
humour
as
usual
,
but
I
thought
his
countenance
was
much
cast
down
.
 
<EOS>
I
rallied
him
,
and
desired
him
to
give
me
his
staff
,
which
he
did
:
 
<EOS>
I
told
him
,
if
he
would
secure
it
me
a
week
,
I
would
set
all
right
:
 
<EOS>
he
asked
how
;
I
said
I
would
immediately
turn
Lord
Marlborough
,
his
two
daughters
,
the
Duke
and
Duchess
of
Somerset
,
and
Lord
Cholmondeley
,
out
of
all
their
employments
;
and
I
believe
he
had
not
a
friend
but
was
of
my
opinion
.
 
<EOS>
Arbuthnot
asked
how
he
came
not
to
secure
a
majority
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
answer
nothing
but
<EOS>
that
he
could
not
help
it
,
if
people
would
lie
and
forswear
.
 
<EOS>
A
poor
answer
for
a
great
Minister
.
 
<EOS>
There
fell
from
him
a
Scripture
expression
,
that
"
the
hearts
of
kings
are
unsearchable
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
told
him
it
was
what
I
feared
,
and
was
from
him
the
worst
news
he
could
tell
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
begged
him
to
know
what
he
had
to
trust
to
:
 
<EOS>
he
stuck
a
little
;
but
at
last
bid
me
not
fear
,
for
all
would
be
well
yet
.
 
<EOS>
We
would
fain
have
had
him
eat
a
bit
where
he
was
,
but
he
would
go
home
,
it
was
past
six
:
 
<EOS>
he
made
me
go
home
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
There
we
found
his
brother
and
Mr.
Secretary
.
 
<EOS>
He
made
his
son
take
a
list
of
all
in
the
House
of
Commons
who
had
places
,
and
yet
voted
against
the
Court
,
in
such
a
manner
as
if
they
should
lose
their
places
:
 
<EOS>
I
doubt
he
is
not
able
to
compass
it
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Keeper
came
in
an
hour
,
and
they
were
going
upon
business
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
left
him
,
and
returned
to
Mrs.
Masham
;
but
she
had
company
with
her
,
and
I
would
not
stay
.
  
<EOS>
This
is
a
long
journal
,
and
of
a
day
that
may
produce
great
alterations
,
and
hazard
the
ruin
of
England
.
 
<EOS>
The
Whigs
are
all
in
triumph
;
they
foretold
how
all
this
would
be
,
but
we
thought
it
boasting
.
 
<EOS>
Nay
,
they
said
the
Parliament
should
be
dissolved
before
Christmas
,
and
perhaps
it
may
:
 
<EOS>
this
is
all
your
d-
  
d
 
<EOS>
Duchess
of
Somerset
's
doings
.
 
<EOS>
I
warned
them
of
it
nine
months
ago
,
and
a
hundred
times
since
:
 
the
Secretary
always
dreaded
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
told
Lord
Treasurer
I
should
have
the
advantage
of
him
;
for
he
would
lose
his
head
,
and
I
should
only
be
hanged
,
and
so
carry
my
body
entire
to
the
grave
.
  
<EOS>
9
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
this
morning
with
Mr.
Secretary
:
 
<EOS>
we
are
both
of
opinion
that
the
Queen
is
false
.
 
<EOS>
I
told
him
what
I
heard
,
and
he
confirmed
it
by
other
circumstances
.
 
<EOS>
I
then
went
to
my
friend
Lewis
,
who
had
sent
to
see
me
.
 
<EOS>
He
talks
of
nothing
but
retiring
to
his
estate
in
Wales
.
 
<EOS>
He
gave
me
reasons
to
believe
the
whole
matter
is
settled
between
the
Queen
and
the
Whigs
;
he
hears
that
Lord
Somers
is
to
be
Treasurer
,
and
believes
that
,
sooner
than
turn
out
the
Duchess
of
Somerset
,
she
will
dissolve
the
Parliament
,
and
get
a
Whiggish
one
,
which
may
be
done
by
managing
elections
.
 
<EOS>
Things
are
now
in
the
crisis
,
and
a
day
or
two
will
determine
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
desired
him
to
engage
Lord
Treasurer
that
as
soon
as
he
finds
the
change
is
resolved
on
,
he
will
send
me
abroad
as
Queen
's
Secretary
somewhere
or
other
,
where
I
may
remain
till
the
new
Ministers
recall
me
;
and
then
I
will
be
sick
for
five
or
six
months
,
till
the
storm
has
spent
itself
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
he
will
grant
me
this
;
for
I
should
hardly
trust
myself
to
the
mercy
of
my
enemies
while
their
anger
is
fresh
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
to
-
day
with
the
Secretary
,
who
affects
mirth
,
and
seems
to
hope
all
will
yet
be
well
.
 
<EOS>
I
took
him
aside
after
dinner
,
told
him
how
I
had
served
them
,
and
had
asked
no
reward
,
but
thought
I
might
ask
security
;
and
then
desired
the
same
thing
of
him
,
to
send
me
abroad
before
a
change
.
 
<EOS>
He
embraced
me
,
and
swore
he
would
take
the
same
care
of
me
as
himself
,
etc
.
,
but
bid
me
have
courage
,
for
that
in
two
days
my
Lord
Treasurer
's
wisdom
would
appear
greater
than
ever
;
that
he
suffered
all
that
had
happened
on
purpose
,
and
had
taken
measures
to
turn
it
to
advantage
.
 
<EOS>
I
said
,
"
God
send
it
"
;
<EOS>
but
I
do
not
believe
a
syllable
;
and
,
as
far
as
I
can
judge
,
the
game
is
lost
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
know
more
soon
,
and
my
letters
will
at
least
be
a
good
history
to
show
you
the
steps
of
this
change
.
  
<EOS>
10
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
this
morning
with
Lewis
,
who
thinks
they
will
let
the
Parliament
sit
till
they
have
given
the
money
,
and
then
dissolve
them
in
spring
,
and
break
the
Ministry
.
 
<EOS>
He
spoke
to
Lord
Treasurer
about
what
I
desired
him
.
 
<EOS>
My
lord
desired
him
with
great
earnestness
to
assure
me
that
all
would
be
well
,
and
that
I
should
fear
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
in
the
City
with
a
friend
.
 
<EOS>
This
day
the
Commons
went
to
the
Queen
with
their
address
,
and
all
the
Lords
who
were
for
the
peace
went
with
them
,
to
show
their
zeal
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
now
some
further
conviction
that
the
Queen
is
false
,
and
it
begins
to
be
known
.
  
<EOS>
11
.
 
<EOS>
I
went
between
two
and
three
to
see
Mrs.
Masham
;
while
I
was
there
she
went
to
her
bed
-
chamber
to
try
a
petticoat
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Treasurer
came
in
to
see
her
,
and
seeing
me
in
the
outer
room
,
fell
a
rallying
me
:
 
<EOS>
says
he
,
"
You
had
better
keep
company
with
me
,
than
with
such
a
fellow
as
Lewis
,
who
has
not
the
soul
of
a
chicken
,
nor
the
heart
of
a
mite
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Then
he
went
in
to
Mrs.
Masham
,
and
as
he
came
back
desired
her
leave
to
let
me
go
home
with
him
to
dinner
.
<EOS>
He
asked
whether
I
was
not
afraid
to
be
seen
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
said
I
never
valued
my
Lord
Treasurer
in
my
life
,
and
therefore
should
have
always
the
same
esteem
for
Mr.
Harley
and
Lord
Oxford
.
 
<EOS>
He
seemed
to
talk
confidently
,
as
if
he
reckoned
that
all
this
would
turn
to
advantage
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
forbear
hinting
that
he
was
not
sure
of
the
Queen
,
and
that
those
scoundrel
,
starving
lords
would
never
have
dared
to
vote
against
the
Court
,
if
Somerset
had
not
assured
them
that
it
would
please
the
Queen
.
 
<EOS>
He
said
that
was
true
,
and
Somerset
did
so
.
 
<EOS>
I
stayed
till
six
;
then
De
Buys
,
the
Dutch
Envoy
,
came
to
him
,
and
I
left
him
.
 
<EOS>
Prior
was
with
us
a
while
after
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
him
and
all
of
them
cast
down
,
though
they
make
the
best
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
12
.
 
<EOS>
Ford
is
come
to
town
;
I
saw
him
last
night
:
 
<EOS>
he
is
in
no
fear
,
but
sanguine
,
although
I
have
told
him
the
state
of
things
.
 
<EOS>
This
change
so
resembles
the
last
,
that
I
wonder
they
do
not
observe
it
.
 
<EOS>
The
Secretary
sent
for
me
yesterday
to
dine
with
him
,
but
I
was
abroad
;
I
hope
he
had
something
to
say
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
morning
,
and
I
write
in
bed
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
going
to
the
Duke
of
Ormond
,
whom
I
have
not
yet
seen
.
 
<EOS>
Morrow
,
sirrahs
.
 
<EOS>
At
night
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
to
see
the
Duke
of
Ormond
this
morning
:
 
<EOS>
he
asked
me
two
or
three
questions
after
his
civil
way
,
and
they
related
to
Ireland
:
 
<EOS>
at
last
I
told
him
that
,
from
the
time
I
had
seen
him
,
I
never
once
thought
of
Irish
affairs
.
 
<EOS>
He
whispered
me
that
he
hoped
I
had
done
some
good
things
here
:
 
<EOS>
I
said
,
if
everybody
else
had
done
half
as
much
,
we
should
not
be
as
we
are
<EOS>
:
 
<EOS>
then
we
went
aside
,
and
talked
over
affairs
.
 
<EOS>
I
told
him
how
all
things
stood
,
and
advised
him
what
was
to
be
done
.
 
<EOS>
I
then
went
and
sat
an
hour
with
the
Duchess
;
then
as
long
with
Lady
Oglethorpe
,
who
is
so
cunning
a
devil
that
I
believe
she
could
yet
find
a
remedy
,
if
they
would
take
her
advice
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
with
a
friend
at
Court
.
  
<EOS>
13
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
this
morning
with
the
Secretary
:
 
<EOS>
he
will
needs
pretend
to
talk
as
if
things
would
be
well
:
 
<EOS>
"
Will
you
believe
it
,
"
said
he
,
"
if
you
see
these
people
turned
out
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
said
,
yes
,
if
I
saw
the
Duke
and
Duchess
of
Somerset
out
:
 
<EOS>
he
swore
if
they
were
not
,
he
would
give
up
his
place
.
 
<EOS>
Our
Society
dined
to
-
day
at
Sir
William
Wyndham
's
;
we
were
thirteen
present
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Orrery
and
two
other
members
were
introduced
:
 
<EOS>
I
left
them
at
seven
.
 
<EOS>
I
forgot
to
tell
you
that
the
printer
told
me
yesterday
that
Morphew
,
the
publisher
,
was
sent
for
by
that
Lord
Chief
-
Justice
,
who
was
a
manager
against
Sacheverell
;
he
showed
him
two
or
three
papers
and
pamphlets
;
among
the
rest
mine
of
the
Conduct
of
the
Allies
,
threatened
him
,
asked
who
was
the
author
,
and
has
bound
him
over
to
appear
next
term
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
not
have
the
impudence
to
do
this
,
if
he
did
not
foresee
what
was
coming
at
Court
.
  
<EOS>
14
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Shelburne
was
with
me
this
morning
,
to
be
informed
of
the
state
of
affairs
,
and
desired
I
would
answer
all
his
objections
against
a
peace
,
which
was
soon
done
,
for
he
would
not
give
me
room
to
put
in
a
word
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
a
man
of
good
sense
enough
;
but
argues
so
violently
,
that
he
will
some
day
or
other
put
himself
into
a
consumption
.
 
<EOS>
He
desires
that
he
may
not
be
denied
when
he
comes
to
see
me
,
which
I
promised
,
but
will
not
perform
.
 
<EOS>
Leigh
and
Sterne
set
out
for
Ireland
on
Monday
se'nnight
:
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
they
will
be
with
you
long
before
this
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
to
-
night
drinking
very
good
wine
in
scurvy
company
,
at
least
some
of
them
;
I
was
drawn
in
,
but
will
be
more
cautious
for
the
future
;
'
tis
late
,
etc
.
  
<EOS>
15
.
 
<EOS>
Morning
.
 
<EOS>
They
say
the
Occasional
Bill
is
brought
to
-
day
into
the
House
of
Lords
;
but
I
know
not
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
now
put
an
end
to
my
letter
,
and
give
it
into
the
post
-
house
myself
.
 
<EOS>
This
will
be
a
memorable
letter
,
and
I
shall
sigh
to
see
it
some
years
hence
.
 
<EOS>
Here
are
the
first
steps
toward
the
ruin
of
an
excellent
Ministry
;
for
I
look
upon
them
as
certainly
ruined
;
and
God
knows
what
may
be
the
consequences
.
 
<EOS>
I
now
bid
my
dearest
MD
farewell
;
for
company
is
coming
,
and
I
must
be
at
Lord
Dartmouth
's
office
by
noon
.
 
<EOS>
Farewell
,
dearest
MD
<EOS>
;
I
wish
you
a
merry
Christmas
;
I
believe
you
will
have
this
about
that
time
.
 
<EOS>
Love
Presto
,
who
loves
MD
above
all
things
a
thousand
times
.
<EOS>
Farewell
again
,
dearest
MD
,

LETTER
37
.
 
<EOS>
LONDON
,
Dec.
15
,
1711
.
  
<EOS>
I
put
in
my
letter
this
evening
myself
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
to
-
day
inquiring
at
the
Secretary
's
office
of
Mr.
Lewis
how
things
went
:
 
<EOS>
I
there
met
Prior
,
<EOS>
who
told
me
he
gave
all
for
gone
,
etc
.
,
and
was
of
opinion
<EOS>
the
whole
Ministry
would
give
up
their
places
next
week
:
 
<EOS>
Lewis
thinks
they
will
not
till
spring
,
when
the
session
is
over
;
both
of
them
entirely
despair
.
 
<EOS>
I
went
to
see
Mrs.
Masham
,
who
invited
me
to
dinner
;
but
I
was
engaged
to
Lewis
.
 
<EOS>
At
four
I
went
to
Masham
's
.
 
<EOS>
He
came
and
whispered
me
that
he
had
it
from
a
very
good
hand
that
all
would
be
well
,
and
I
found
them
both
very
cheerful
.
 
<EOS>
The
company
was
going
to
the
opera
,
but
desired
I
would
come
and
sup
with
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
did
so
at
ten
,
and
Lord
Treasurer
was
there
,
and
sat
with
us
till
past
twelve
,
and
was
more
cheerful
than
I
have
seen
him
these
ten
days
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Masham
told
me
he
was
mightily
cast
down
some
days
ago
,
and
he
could
not
indeed
hide
it
from
me
.
<EOS>
Arbuthnot
is
in
good
hopes
that
the
Queen
has
not
betrayed
us
,
but
only
has
been
frightened
,
and
flattered
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
can
not
yet
be
of
his
opinion
,
whether
my
reasons
are
better
,
or
that
my
fears
are
greater
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
resolve
,
if
they
give
up
,
or
are
turned
out
soon
,
to
retire
for
some
months
,
and
I
have
pitched
upon
the
place
already
:
 
<EOS>
but
I
will
take
methods
for
hearing
from
MD
,
and
writing
to
them
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
would
be
out
of
the
way
upon
the
first
of
the
ferment
;
for
they
lay
all
things
on
me
,
even
some
I
have
never
read
.
  
<EOS>
16
.
 
<EOS>
I
took
courage
to
-
day
,
and
went
to
Court
with
a
very
cheerful
countenance
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
mightily
crowded
;
both
parties
coming
to
observe
each
other
's
faces
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
avoided
Lord
Halifax
's
bow
till
he
forced
it
on
me
;
but
we
did
not
talk
together
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
make
less
than
fourscore
bows
,
of
which
about
twenty
might
be
to
Whigs
.
 
<EOS>
The
Duke
of
Somerset
is
gone
to
Petworth
,
and
,
I
hear
,
the
Duchess
too
,
of
which
I
shall
be
very
glad
.
 
<EOS>
Prince
Eugene
,
who
was
expected
here
some
days
ago
,
we
are
now
told
,
will
not
come
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
The
Whigs
designed
to
have
met
him
with
forty
thousand
horse
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Treasurer
told
me
some
days
ago
of
his
discourse
with
the
Emperor
's
Resident
,
that
puppy
Hoffman
,
about
Prince
Eugene
's
coming
;
by
which
I
found
my
lord
would
hinder
it
,
if
he
could
;
and
we
shall
be
all
glad
if
he
does
not
come
,
and
think
it
a
good
point
gained
.

Sir
Andrew
Fountaine
,
Ford
,
and
<EOS>
I
dined
to
-
day
with
Mrs.
Van
,
by
invitation
.
  
<EOS>
17
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
mistaken
the
day
of
the
month
,
and
been
forced
to
mend
it
thrice
.
<EOS>
I
dined
to
-
day
with
Mr.
Masham
and
his
lady
,
by
invitation
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Treasurer
was
to
be
there
,
but
came
not
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
to
entertain
Buys
,
<EOS>
the
Dutch
Envoy
,
who
speaks
English
well
enough
:
 
<EOS>
he
was
plaguily
politic
,
telling
a
thousand
lies
,
of
which
none
passed
upon
any
of
us
.
 
<EOS>
We
are
still
in
the
condition
of
suspense
,
and
I
think
have
little
hopes
.
 
<EOS>
The
Duchess
of
Somerset
is
not
gone
to
Petworth
;
only
the
Duke
,
and
that
is
a
poor
sacrifice
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
the
Queen
certainly
designs
to
change
the
Ministry
,
but
perhaps
may
put
it
off
till
the
session
is
over
:
 
and
<EOS>
I
think
they
had
better
give
up
now
,
if
she
will
not
deal
openly
;
and
then
they
need
not
answer
for
the
consequences
of
a
peace
,
when
it
is
in
other
hands
,
and
may
yet
be
broken
.
 
<EOS>
They
say
my
Lord
Privy
Seal
sets
out
for
Holland
this
week
:
 
<EOS>
so
the
peace
goes
on
.
  
<EOS>

.
 
<EOS>
It
has
rained
hard
from
morning
till
night
,
and
cost
me
three
shillings
in
coach
-
hire
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
had
abundance
of
wet
weather
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
in
the
City
,
and
was
with
the
printer
,
who
has
now
a
fifth
edition
of
the
Conduct
,
etc
.
<EOS>
:
it
is
in
small
,
and
sold
for
sixpence
;
they
have
printed
as
many
as
three
editions
,
because
they
are
to
be
sent
in
numbers
into
the
country
by
great
men
,
etc
.
,
who
subscribe
for
hundreds
.
 
<EOS>
It
has
been
sent
a
fortnight
ago
to
Ireland
:
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
you
will
print
it
there
.
 
<EOS>
The
Tory
Lords
and
Commons
in
Parliament
argue
all
from
it
;
and
all
agree
that
never
anything
of
that
kind
was
of
so
great
consequence
,
or
made
so
many
converts
.
 
<EOS>
By
the
time
I
have
sent
this
letter
,
I
expect
to
hear
from
little
MD
:
 
it
will
be
a
month
,
two
days
hence
,
since
I
had
your
last
,
and
I
will
allow
ten
days
for
accidents
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
get
rid
of
the
leavings
of
a
cold
I
got
a
month
ago
,
or
else
it
is
a
new
one
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
writing
letters
all
this
evening
till
I
am
weary
,
and
I
am
sending
out
another
little
thing
,
which
I
hope
to
finish
this
week
,
and
design
to
send
to
the
printer
in
an
unknown
hand
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
printed
a
Grub
Street
speech
of
Lord
Nottingham
;
and
he
was
such
an
owl
to
complain
of
it
in
the
House
of
Lords
,
who
have
taken
up
the
printer
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
heard
at
Court
that
Walpole
(
a
great
Whig
member
)
said
that
I
and
my
whimsical
Club
writ
it
at
one
of
our
meetings
,
and
that
I
should
pay
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
will
find
he
lies
:
 
<EOS>
and
I
shall
let
him
know
by
a
third
hand
<EOS>
my
thoughts
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
to
be
Secretary
of
State
,
if
the
Ministry
changes
;
but
he
has
lately
had
a
bribe
proved
against
him
in
Parliament
,
while
he
was
Secretary
at
War
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
one
of
the
Whigs
'
chief
speakers
.
  
<EOS>
19
.
 
<EOS>
Sad
dismal
weather
.
 
<EOS>
I
went
to
the
Secretary
's
office
,
and
Lewis
made
me
dine
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
intended
to
have
dined
with
Lord
Treasurer
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
seen
the
Secretary
this
week
.
 
<EOS>
Things
do
not
mend
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Dartmouth
despairs
,
and
is
for
giving
up
<EOS>
;
Lewis
is
of
the
same
mind
;
but
Lord
Treasurer
only
says
,
"
Poh
,
poh
,
all
will
be
well
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
am
come
home
early
to
finish
something
I
am
doing
;
but
I
find
I
want
heart
and
humour
,
and
would
read
any
idle
book
that
came
in
my
way
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
just
sent
away
a
penny
paper
to
make
a
little
mischief
.
 
<EOS>
Patrick
is
gone
to
the
burial
of
an
Irish
footman
,
who
was
Dr.
King
's
servant
;
he
died
of
a
consumption
,
a
fit
death
for
a
poor
starving
wit
's
footman
.
 
<EOS>
The
Irish
servants
always
club
to
bury
a
countryman
.
  
<EOS>
20
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
with
the
Secretary
this
morning
,
and
,
for
aught
I
can
see
,
we
shall
have
a
languishing
death
:
 
<EOS>
I
can
know
nothing
,
nor
themselves
neither
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
,
you
know
,
with
our
Society
,
and
that
odious
Secretary
would
make
me
President
next
week
;
so
I
must
entertain
them
this
day
se'nnight
at
the
Thatched
House
Tavern
,
where
we
dined
to
-
day
:
 
<EOS>
it
will
cost
me
five
or
six
pounds
;
yet
the
Secretary
says
he
will
give
me
wine
.
 
<EOS>
I
found
a
letter
when
I
came
home
from
the
Bishop
of
Clogher
.
  
<EOS>
21
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
the
first
time
I
ever
got
a
new
cold
before
the
old
one
was
going
:
 
<EOS>
it
came
yesterday
,
and
appeared
in
all
due
forms
,
eyes
and
nose
running
,
etc
.
,
and
is
now
very
bad
;
and
I
can
not
tell
how
I
got
it
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
Andrew
Fountaine
and
I
were
invited
to
dine
with
Mrs.
Van
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
this
morning
with
the
Duke
of
Ormond
;
and
neither
he
nor
I
can
think
of
anything
to
comfort
us
in
present
affairs
.
 
<EOS>
We
must
certainly
fall
,
if
the
Duchess
of
Somerset
be
not
turned
out
;
and
nobody
believes
the
Queen
will
ever
part
with
her
.
 
<EOS>
The
Duke
and
I
were
settling
when
Mr.
Secretary
and
I
should
dine
with
him
,
and
he
fixes
upon
Tuesday
;
and
when
I
came
away
I
remembered
it
was
Christmas
Day
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
to
see
Lady
#
#
#
#
,
 
who
is
just
up
after
lying
-
in
;
and
the
ugliest
sight
I
have
seen
,
pale
,
dead
,
old
and
yellow
,
for
want
of
her
paint
.
 
<EOS>
She
has
turned
my
stomach
.
 
<EOS>
But
she
will
soon
be
painted
,
and
a
beauty
again
.
  
<EOS>
22
.
 
<EOS>
I
find
myself
disordered
with
a
pain
all
round
the
small
of
my
back
,
which
I
imputed
to
champagne
<EOS>
I
had
drunk
;
but
find
it
to
have
been
only
my
new
cold
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
fine
frosty
day
,
and
I
resolved
to
walk
into
the
City
.
 
<EOS>
I
called
at
Lord
Treasurer
's
at
eleven
,
and
stayed
some
time
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
showed
me
a
letter
from
a
great
Presbyterian
parson
to
him
,
complaining
how
their
friends
had
betrayed
them
by
passing
this
Conformity
Bill
;
and
he
showed
me
the
answer
he
had
written
,
which
his
friends
would
not
let
him
send
;
but
was
a
very
good
one
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
very
cheerful
;
but
gives
one
no
hopes
,
nor
has
any
to
give
.
 
<EOS>
I
went
into
the
City
,
and
there
I
dined
.
  
<EOS>
23
.
 
<EOS>
Morning
.
 
<EOS>
As
I
was
dressing
to
go
to
church
,
a
friend
that
was
to
see
me
advised
me
not
to
stir
out
;
so
I
shall
keep
at
home
to
-
day
,
and
only
eat
some
broth
,
if
I
can
get
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
a
terrible
cold
frost
,
and
snow
fell
yesterday
,
which
still
remains
:
 
look
there
<EOS>
,
you
may
see
it
from
the
penthouses
.
 
<EOS>
The
Lords
made
yesterday
two
or
three
votes
about
peace
,
and
Hanover
,
of
a
very
angry
kind
to
vex
the
Ministry
,
and
they
will
meet
sooner
by
a
fortnight
than
the
Commons
;
and
they
say
,
are
preparing
some
knocking
addresses
.
 
<EOS>
Morrow
,
sirrahs
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
sit
at
home
,
and
when
I
go
to
bed
I
will
tell
you
how
I
am
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
sat
at
home
all
day
,
and
eaten
only
a
mess
of
broth
and
a
roll
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
written
a
Prophecy
,
which
I
design
to
print
;
I
did
it
to
-
day
,
and
some
other
verses
.
  
<EOS>
24
.
 
<EOS>
I
went
into
the
City
to
-
day
in
a
coach
,
and
dined
there
.
 
<EOS>
My
cold
is
going
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
now
bitter
hard
frost
,
and
has
been
so
these
three
or
four
days
.
<EOS>
My
Prophecy
is
printed
,
and
will
be
published
after
Christmas
Day
;
I
like
it
mightily
:
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
how
it
will
pass
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
never
understand
it
at
your
distance
,
without
help
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
everybody
will
guess
it
to
be
mine
,
because
it
is
somewhat
in
the
same
manner
with
that
of
"
Merlin
"
in
the
Miscellanies
.
 
<EOS>
My
Lord
Privy
Seal
set
out
this
day
for
Holland
:
 
he
'll
have
a
cold
journey
.
 
<EOS>
I
gave
Patrick
half
a
crown
for
his
Christmas
box
,
on
condition
he
would
be
good
,
and
he
came
home
drunk
at
midnight
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
taken
a
memorandum
of
it
,
because
I
never
design
to
give
him
a
groat
more
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
cruel
cold
.
  
<EOS>
25
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
MD
a
merry
Christmas
,
and
many
a
one
;
but
mine
is
melancholy
:
 
I
durst
not
go
to
church
to
-
day
,
finding
myself
a
little
out
of
order
,
and
it
snowing
prodigiously
,
and
freezing
.
 
<EOS>
At
noon
I
went
to
Mrs.
Van
,
who
had
this
week
engaged
me
to
dine
there
to
-
day
:
 
<EOS>
and
there
I
received
the
news
that
poor
Mrs.
Long
died
at
Lynn
in
Norfolk
on
Saturday
last
,
at
four
in
the
morning
<EOS>
:
she
was
sick
but
four
hours
.
 
<EOS>
We
suppose
it
was
the
asthma
,
which
she
was
subject
to
as
well
as
the
dropsy
,
as
she
sent
me
word
in
her
last
letter
,
written
about
five
weeks
ago
;
but
then
said
she
was
recovered
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
was
more
afflicted
at
any
death
.
 
<EOS>
The
poor
creature
had
retired
to
Lynn
two
years
ago
,
to
live
cheap
,
and
pay
her
debts
.
 
<EOS>
In
her
last
letter
she
told
me
she
hoped
to
be
easy
by
Christmas
;
and
she
kept
her
word
,
although
she
meant
it
otherwise
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
all
sorts
of
amiable
qualities
,
and
no
ill
ones
,
but
the
indiscretion
of
too
much
neglecting
her
own
affairs
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
two
thousand
pounds
left
her
by
an
old
grandmother
,
with
which
she
intended
to
pay
her
debts
,
and
live
on
an
annuity
she
had
of
one
hundred
pounds
a
year
,
and
Newburg
House
,
which
would
be
about
sixty
pounds
more
.
 
<EOS>
That
odious
grandmother
living
so
long
,
forced
her
to
retire
;
for
the
two
thousand
pounds
was
settled
on
her
after
the
old
woman
's
death
,
yet
her
brute
of
a
brother
,
Sir
James
Long
,
would
not
advance
it
for
her
;
else
she
might
have
paid
her
debts
,
and
continued
here
,
and
lived
still
:
 
<EOS>
I
believe
melancholy
helped
her
on
to
her
grave
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
ordered
a
paragraph
to
be
put
in
the
Postboy
,
giving
an
account
of
her
death
,
and
making
honourable
mention
of
her
;
which
is
all
I
can
do
to
serve
her
memory
:
 
but
one
reason
was
spite
;
for
her
brother
would
fain
have
her
death
a
secret
,
to
save
the
charge
of
bringing
her
up
here
to
bury
her
,
or
going
into
mourning
.
 
<EOS>
Pardon
all
this
,
for
the
sake
of
a
poor
creature
I
had
so
much
friendship
for
.
  
<EOS>
26
.
 
<EOS>
I
went
to
Mr.
Secretary
this
morning
,
and
he
would
have
me
dine
with
him
.
<EOS>
I
called
at
noon
at
Mrs.
Masham
's
,
who
desired
me
not
to
let
the
Prophecy
be
published
,
for
fear
of
angering
the
Queen
about
the
Duchess
of
Somerset
;
so
I
writ
to
the
printer
to
stop
them
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
been
printed
and
given
about
,
but
not
sold
.
 
<EOS>
I
saw
Lord
Treasurer
there
,
who
had
been
two
hours
with
the
Queen
;
and
Mrs.
Masham
is
in
hopes
things
will
do
well
again
.
 
<EOS>
I
went
at
night
again
,
and
supped
at
Mr.
Masham
's
,
and
Lord
Treasurer
sat
with
us
till
one
o'clock
.
<EOS>
So
'
tis
late
,
etc
.
  
<EOS>
27
.
 
<EOS>
I
entertained
our
Society
at
the
Thatched
House
Tavern
to
-
day
at
dinner
;
but
<EOS>
brother
Bathurst
sent
for
wine
,
the
house
affording
none
.
 
<EOS>
The
printer
had
not
received
my
letter
,
and
so
he
brought
up
dozens
apiece
of
the
Prophecy
;
but
I
ordered
him
to
part
with
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
an
admirable
good
one
,
and
people
are
mad
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
The
frost
still
continues
violently
cold
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Masham
invited
me
to
come
to
-
night
and
play
at
cards
;
but
our
Society
did
not
part
till
nine
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
supped
with
Mrs.
Hill
,
her
sister
,
and
there
was
Mrs.
Masham
and
Lord
Treasurer
,
and
we
stayed
till
twelve
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
endeavouring
to
get
a
majority
against
next
Wednesday
,
when
the
House
of
Lords
is
to
meet
,
and
the
Whigs
intend
to
make
some
violent
addresses
against
a
peace
,
if
not
prevented
.
<EOS>
God
knows
what
will
become
of
us
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
still
prodigiously
cold
;
but
so
I
told
you
already
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
eggs
on
the
spit

When
I
came
home
tonight
I
found
,
forsooth
,
a
letter
from
MD
,
N.24
,
24
,
24
,

;
there
,
do
you
know
the
numbers
now
?
<EOS>
and
at
the
same
time
one
from
Joe
,
full
of
thanks
:
 
let
him
know
I
have
received
it
,
and
am
glad
of
his
success
,
but
wo
n't
put
him
to
the
charge
of
a
letter
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
a
letter
some
time
ago
from
Mr.
Warburton
,
and
I
beg
one
of
you
will
copy
out
what
I
shall
tell
you
,
and
send
it
by
some
opportunity
to
Warburton
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
as
follows
:
 
<EOS>
The
Doctor
has
received
Mr.
Warburton
's
letter
,
and
desires
he
will
let
the
Doctor
know
where
that
accident
he
mentions
is
like
soon
to
happen
,
and
he
will
do
what
he
can
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
And
pray
,
<EOS>
madam
,
let
them
know
that
I
do
this
to
save
myself
the
trouble
,
and
them
the
expense
of
a
letter
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
think
that
this
is
enough
for
one
that
comes
home
at
twelve
from
a
Lord
Treasurer
and
Mrs.
Masham
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
I
could
tell
you
ten
thousand
things
of
our
mad
politics
,
upon
what
small
circumstances
great
affairs
have
turned
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
will
go
rest
my
busy
head
.
  
<EOS>

<EOS>
I
was
this
morning
with
brother
Bathurst
to
see
the
Duke
of
Ormond
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
given
his
Grace
some
hopes
to
be
one
of
our
Society
.
 
<EOS>
The
Secretary
and
I
and
Bathurst
are
to
dine
with
him
on
Sunday
next
.
 
<EOS>
The
Duke
is
not
in
much
hopes
,
but
has
been
very
busy
in
endeavouring
to
bring
over
some
lords
against
next
Wednesday
.
 
<EOS>
The
Duchess
caught
me
as
I
was
going
out
;
she
is
sadly
in
fear
about
things
,
and
blames
me
for
not
mending
them
by
my
credit
with
Lord
Treasurer
;
and
I
blame
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
met
me
in
the
street
at
noon
,
and
engaged
me
to
dine
with
her
,
which
I
did
;
and
we
talked
an
hour
after
dinner
in
her
closet
.
 
<EOS>
If
we
miscarry
on
Wednesday
,
I
believe
it
will
be
by
some
strange
sort
of
neglect
.
 
<EOS>
They
talk
of
making
eight
new
lords
by
calling
up
some
peers
'
eldest
sons
;
but
they
delay
strangely
.
 
<EOS>
I
saw
Judge
Coote
to
-
day
at
the
Duke
of
Ormond
's
:
 
<EOS>
he
desires
to
come
and
see
me
,
to
justify
his
principles

shall

Shelburne
has

I
write
this
post

<EOS>
I
owe
the
Archbishop
a

this
long
time
.
 
<EOS>
All
people
that
come
from
Ireland
complain
of
him
,
and
scold
me
for
protecting
him

<EOS>
Pray
,
Madam
Dingley

let
me
know
what
Presto
has
received
for
this

or
whether
anything
is
due

nine

ones

the

has
turned

She
is
awaked

so
is
Lord

<EOS>
I
want
nothing

to

the

out

But
we
shall

without

LETTER
38
.
 
<EOS>
LONDON
,
Dec.
29
,
1711
.
  
<EOS>
I
put
my
letter
in
this
evening
,
after
coming
from
dinner
at
Ned
Southwell
's
,
where
I
drank
very
good
Irish
wine
,
and
we
are
in
great
joy
at
this
happy
turn
of
affairs
.
 
<EOS>
The
Queen
has
been
at
last
persuaded
to
her
own
interest
and
security
,
and
I
freely
think
she
must
have
made
both
herself
and
kingdom
very
unhappy
,
if
she
had
done
otherwise
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
still
a
mighty
secret
that
Masham
is
to
be
one
of
the
new
lords
;
they
say
he
does
not
yet
know
it
himself
;
but
the
Queen
is
to
surprise
him
with
it
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Secretary
will
be
a
lord
at
the
end
of
the
session
;
but
they
want
him
still
in
Parliament
.
 
<EOS>
After
all
,
it
is
a
strange
unhappy
necessity
of
making
so
many
peers
together
;
but
the
Queen
has
drawn
it
upon
herself
,
by
her
confounded
trimming
and
moderation
.
 
<EOS>
Three
,
as
I
told
you
,

our

<EOS>
I
writ
the
Dean
and
you
a
lie
yesterday
;
for
the
Duke
of
Somerset
is
not
yet
turned
out
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
to
-
day
at
Court
,
and
resolved
to
be
very
civil
to
the
Whigs
;
but
saw
few
there
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
was
in
the
bed
-
chamber
talking
to
Lord
Rochester
,
he
went
up
to
Lady
Burlington
,
who
asked
him
who
I
was
;
and
Lady
Sunderland
<EOS>
and
she
whispered
about
me
:
 
<EOS>
I
desired
Lord
Rochester
to
tell
Lady
Sunderland
<EOS>
I
doubted
she
was
not
as
much
in
love
with
me
as
I
was
with
her
;
but
he
would
not
deliver
my
message
.
 
<EOS>
The
Duchess
of
Shrewsbury
came
running
up
to
me
,
and
clapped
her
fan
up
to
hide
us
from
the
company
,
and
we
gave
one
another
joy
of
this
change
;
but
sighed
when
we
reflected
on
the
Somerset
family
not
being
out
.
 
<EOS>
The
Secretary
and
I
,
and
brother
Bathurst
,
and
Lord
Windsor
,
dined
with
the
Duke
of
Ormond
.
 
<EOS>
Bathurst
and
Windsor
are
to
be
two
of
the
new
lords
.
 
<EOS>
I
desired
my
Lord
Radnor
's
brother
,
at
Court
to
-
day
,
to
let
my
lord
know
I
would
call
on
him
at
six
,
which
I
did
,
and
was
arguing
with
him
three
hours
to
bring
him
over
to
us
,
and
I
spoke
so
closely
that
I
believe
he
will
be
tractable
;
but
he
is
a
scoundrel
,
and
though
I
said
I
only
talked
for
my
love
to
him
,
I
told
a
lie
;
for
I
did
not
care
if
he
were
hanged
:
 
but
everyone
gained
over
is
of
consequence
.
 
<EOS>
The
Duke
of
Marlborough
was
at
Court
today
,
and
nobody
hardly
took
notice
of
him

<EOS>
Masham
's
being
a

begins
to
take
wind
:
 
<EOS>
nothing
at
Court
can
be
kept
a

will
be
a
great

Our
frost
is
broken
since
yesterday
,
and
it
is
very
slabbery
;
yet
I
walked
to
the
City
and
dined
,
and
ordered
some
things
with
the
printer
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
settled
Dr.
King
in
the
Gazette
;
it
will
be
worth
two
hundred
pounds
a
year
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
Our
new
lords
'
patents
are
passed
:
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
like
the
expedient
,
if
we
could
have
found
any
other
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
I
have
said
this
before
.
 
<EOS>
I
hear
the
Duke
of
Marlborough
is
turned
out
of
all
his
employments
:
 
<EOS>
I
shall
know
to
-
morrow
when
I
am
to
carry
Dr.
King
to
dine
with
the
Secretary
.
 
<EOS>
These
are
strong
remedies
;
pray
God
the
patient
is
able
to
bear
them
.
 
<EOS>
The
last
Ministry
people
are
utterly

<EOS>
Now
I
wish
my
dearest
little
MD
many
happy
new
years
;
yes
,
both
Dingley
and
Stella
,
ay
and
Presto
too
,
many
happy
new
years
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
with
the
Secretary
,
and
it
is
true
that
the
Duke
of
Marlborough
is
turned
out
of
all
.
<EOS>
The
Duke
of
Ormond
has
got
his
regiment
of
foot
-
guards
,
I
know
not
who
has
the
rest
.
<EOS>
If
the
Ministry
be
not
sure
of
a
peace
,
I
shall
wonder
at
this
step
,
and
do
not
approve
it
at
best
.
<EOS>
The
Queen
and
Lord
Treasurer
mortally
hate
the
Duke
of
Marlborough
,
and
to
that
he
owes
his
fall
,
more
than
to
his
other
faults
:
unless
he
has
been
tampering
too
far
with
his
party
,
of
which
I
have
not
heard
any
particulars
;
however
it
be
,
the
world
abroad
will
blame
us
.
 
<EOS>
I
confess
my
belief
that
he
has
not
one
good
quality
in
the
world
beside
that
of
a
general
,
and
even
that
I
have
heard
denied
by
several
great
soldiers
.
 
<EOS>
But
we
have
had
constant
success
in
arms
while
he
commanded
.
 
<EOS>
Opinion
is
a
mighty
matter
in
war
,
and
I
doubt
the
French
think
it
impossible
to
conquer
an
army
that
he
leads
,
and
our
soldiers
think
the
same
;
and
how
far
even
this
step
may
encourage
the
French
to
play
tricks
with
us
,
no
man
knows
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
love
to
see
personal
resentment
mix
with
public
affairs
.

This
being
the
day
the
Lords
meet
,
and
the
new
peers
to
be
introduced
,
I
went
to
Westminster
to
see
the
sight
;
but
the
crowd
was
too
great
in
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
only
went
into
the
robing
-
room
,
to
give
my
four
brothers
joy
,
and
Sir
Thomas
Mansel
,
and
Lord
Windsor
;
the
other
six
I
am
not
acquainted
with
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
apprehended
the
Whigs
would
have
raised
some
difficulties
,
but
nothing
happened
.
 
<EOS>
I
went
to
see
Lady
Masham
at
noon
,
and
wish
her
joy
of
her
new
honour
,
and
a
happy
new
year
.
 
<EOS>
I
found
her
very
well
pleased
;
for
peerage
will
be
some
sort
of
protection
to
her
upon
any
turn
of
affairs
.
 
<EOS>
She
engaged
me
to
come
at
night
,
and
sup
with
her
and
Lord
Treasurer
:
 
<EOS>
I
went
at
nine
,
and
she
was
not
at
home
,
so
I
would
not
stay
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
no
,
I
wo
n't
answer
your
letter
yet
,
young
women

<EOS>
I
dined
with
a
friend
in
the
neighbourhood
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
nothing
here
like
Christmas
,
except
brawn
or
mince
-
pies
in
places
where
I
dine
,
and
giving
away
my
half
-
crowns
like
farthings
to
great
men
's
porters
and
butlers
.
<EOS>
Yesterday
I
paid
seven
good
guineas
to
the
fellow
at
the
tavern
where
I
treated
the
Society
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
great
mind
to
send
you
the
bill
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
told
you
some
articles
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
heard
whether
anything
was
done
in
the
House
of
Lords
after
introducing
the
new
ones

This

Lord

we
choose
every
week
;
the
last
President
treats
and
chooses
his
successor
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
our
dinner
cost
fifteen
pounds
beside
wine
.
 
<EOS>
The
Secretary
grew
brisk
,
and
would
not
let
me
go
,
nor
Lord
Lansdowne
,
who
would
fain
have
gone
home
to
his
lady
,
being
newly
married
to
Lady
Mary
Thynne
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
near
one
when
we
parted

so
you
must
think
I
can
not
write
much

night

The
adjourning
of
the
House
of
Lords
yesterday
,
as
the
Queen
desired

was
just
carried
by
the
twelve
new
lords
,
and
one
more

<EOS>
Lord
Radnor
was
not
there
:
 
<EOS>
I
hope
I
have
cured
him

<EOS>
Did
I
tell
you
that
I
have
brought
Dr.
King
in
to
be
Gazetteer
?
 
<EOS>
It
will
be
worth
above
two
hundred
pounds
a
year
to
him
:
 
<EOS>
I
believe
I
told
you
so
before
,
but
I
am
forgetful
.
 
<EOS>
Go
,
get
you
gone
to
ombre
,
and
claret
,
and
toasted
oranges
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
go
sleep
.

.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
get
rid
of
the
leavings
of
my
cold
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
in
the
City
to
-
day
,
and
dined
with
my
printer
,
and
gave
him
a
ballad
made
by
several
hands
,
I
know
not
whom
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
Lord
Treasurer
had
a
finger
in
it
;
I
added
three
stanzas
;
I
suppose
Dr.
Arbuthnot
had
the
greatest
share
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
been
overseeing
some
other
little
prints
,
and
a
pamphlet
made
by
one
of
my
under
-
strappers
.
<EOS>
Somerset
is
not
out
yet
.
 
<EOS>
I
doubt
not
<EOS>
but
you
will
have
the
Prophecy
in
Ireland
,
although
it
is
not
published
here
,
only
printed
copies
given
to
friends
.
 
<EOS>
Tell
me
,
do
you
understand
it
?
 
<EOS>
No
,
faith
,
not
without
help
.
 
<EOS>
Tell
me
what
you
stick
at
,
and
I
'll
explain
.
 
<EOS>
We
turned
out
a
member
of
our
Society
yesterday
for
gross
neglect
and
non
-
attendance
.
 
<EOS>
I
writ
to
him
by
order
to
give
him
notice
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
Tom
Harley
,
secretary
to
the
Treasurer
,
and
cousin
-
german
to
Lord
Treasurer
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
going
to
Hanover
from
the
Queen
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
to
give
the
Duke
of
Ormond
notice
of
his
election
as
soon
as
I
can
see
him
.
  
<EOS>

.
 
<EOS>
I
went
this
morning
with
a
parishioner
of
mine
,
one
Nuttal
,
who
came
over
here
for
a
legacy
of
one
hundred
pounds
,
and
a
roguish
lawyer
had
refused
to
pay
him
,
and
would
not
believe
he
was
the
man
.
 
<EOS>
I
writ
to
the
lawyer
a
sharp
letter
,
that
I
had
taken
Nuttal
into
my
protection
,
and
was
resolved
to
stand
by
him
,
and
the
next
news
was
,
that
the
lawyer
desired
I
would
meet
him
,
and
attest
<EOS>
he
was
the
man
,
which
I
did
,
and
his
money
was
paid
upon
the
spot
.
 
<EOS>
I
then
visited
Lord
Treasurer
,
who
is
now
right
again
,
and
all
well
,
only
that
the
Somerset
family
is
not
out
yet
.
 
<EOS>
I
hate
that
;
I
do
n't
like
it
,
as
the
man
said
,
by
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
Then
I
went
and
visited
poor
Will
Congreve
,
who
had
a
French
fellow
tampering
with
one
of
his
eyes
;
he
is
almost
blind
of
both
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
with
some
merchants
in
the
City
,
but
could
not
see
Stratford
,
with
whom
I
had
business
.
 
<EOS>
Presto
,
leave
off
your
impertinence
,
and
answer
our
letter
,
saith
MD
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
yes
,
one
of
these
days
,
when
I
have
nothing
else
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
O
,
faith
,
this
letter
is
a
week
written
,
and
not
one
side
done
yet
.
<EOS>
These
ugly
spots
are
not
tobacco
,
but
this
is
the
last
gilt
sheet
I
have
of
large
paper
,
therefore
hold
your
tongue
.
 
<EOS>
Nuttal
was
surprised
when
they
gave
him
bits
of
paper
instead
of
money
,
but
I
made
Ben
Tooke
put
him
in
his
geers
:
 
he
could
not
reckon
ten
pounds
,
but
was
puzzled
with
the
Irish
way
.
 
<EOS>
Ben
Tooke
and
my
printer
have
desired
me
to
make
them
stationers
to
the
Ordnance
,
of
which
Lord
Rivers
is
Master
,
instead
of
the
Duke
of
Marlborough
.
 
<EOS>
It
will
be
a
hundred
pounds
a
year
apiece
to
them
,
if
I
can
get
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
try
to
-
morrow
.
  
<EOS>
6
.
 
<EOS>
I
went
this
morning
to
Earl
Rivers
,
gave
him
joy
of
his
new
employment
,
and
desired
him
to
prefer
my
printer
and
bookseller
to
be
stationers
to
his
office
.
 
<EOS>
He
immediately
granted
it
me
;
but
,
like
an
old
courtier
,
told
me
it
was
wholly
on
my
account
,
but
that
he
heard
I
had
intended
to
engage
Mr.
Secretary
to
speak
to
him
,
and
desired
I
would
engage
him
to
do
so
,
but
that
,
however
,
he
did
it
only
for
my
sake
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
a
Court
trick
,
to
oblige
as
many
as
you
can
at
once
.
 
<EOS>
I
read
prayers
to
poor
Mrs.
Wesley
,
who
is
very
much
out
of
order
,
instead
of
going
to
church
;
and
then
I
went
to
Court
,
which
I
found
very
full
,
in
expectation
of
seeing
Prince
Eugene
,
who
landed
last
night
,
and
lies
at
Leicester
House
;
he
was
not
to
see
the
Queen
till
six
this
evening
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
and
believe
he
comes
too
late
to
do
the
Whigs
<EOS>
any
good
.
 
<EOS>
I
refused
dining
with
the
Secretary
,
and
was
like
to
lose
my
dinner
,
which
was
at
a
private
acquaintance
's
.
 
<EOS>
I
went
at
six
 
to
see
the
Prince
at
Court
,
but
he
was
gone
in
to
the
Queen
;
and
when
he
came
out
,
Mr.
Secretary
,
who
introduced
him
,
walked
so
near
him
that
he
quite
screened
me
from
him
with
his
great
periwig
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
tell
you
a
good
passage
:
 
as
Prince
Eugene
was
going
with
Mr.
Secretary
to
Court
,
he
told
the
Secretary
that
Hoffman
,
the
Emperor
's
Resident
,
said
to
His
Highness
that
it
was
not
proper
to
go
to
Court
without
a
long
wig
,
and
his
was
a
tied
-
up
one
:
 
<EOS>
"
Now
,
"
says
the
Prince
,
"
I
knew
not
what
to
do
,
for
I
never
had
a
long
periwig
in
my
life
;
and
I
have
sent
to
all
my
valets
and
footmen
,
to
see
whether
any
of
them
have
one
,
that
I
might
borrow
it
,
but
none
of
them
has
any
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Was
not
this
spoken
very
greatly
with
some
sort
of
contempt
?
 
<EOS>
But
the
Secretary
said
it
was
a
thing
of
no
consequence
,
and
only
observed
by
gentlemen
ushers
.
 
<EOS>
I
supped
with
Lord
Masham
,
where
Lord
Treasurer
and
Mr.
Secretary
supped
with
us
:
 
the
first
left
us
at
twelve
,
but
the
rest
did
not
part
till
two
,
yet
I
have
written
all
this
,
because
it
is
fresh
:
 
and
<EOS>
now
I
'll
go
sleep
if
I
can
;
that
is
,
I
believe
I
shall
,
because
I
have
drank
a
little
.
  
<EOS>
7
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
this
morning
to
give
the
Duke
of
Ormond
notice
of
the
honour
<EOS>
done
him
to
make
him
one
of
our
Society
,
and
to
invite
him
on
Thursday
next
to
the
Thatched
House
:
 
he
has
accepted
it
with
the
gratitude
and
humility
such
a
preferment
deserves
,
but
can
not
come
till
the
next
meeting
,
because
Prince
Eugene
is
to
dine
with
him
that
day
,
which
I
allowed
for
:
 
a
good
excuse
,
and
will
report
accordingly
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
with
Lord
Masham
,
and
sat
there
till
eight
this
evening
,
and
came
home
,
because
I
was
not
very
well
,
but
a
little
griped
;
but
now
I
am
well
again
,
I
will
not
go
,
at
least
but
very
seldom
,
to
Lord
Masham
's
suppers
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Treasurer
is
generally
there
,
and
that
tempts
me
,
but
late
sitting
up
does
not
agree
with
me
:
 
<EOS>
there
's
the
short
and
the
long
,
and
I
wo
n't
do
it
;
so
take
your
answer
,
dear
little
young
women
;
and
I
have
no
more
to
say
to
you
to
-
night
,
because
of
the
Archbishop
,
for
I
am
going
to
write
a
long
letter
to
him
,
but
not
so
politely
as
formerly
:
 
I
wo
n't
trust
him
.
  
<EOS>
8
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
then
,
come
,
let
us
see
this
letter
;
if
I
must
answer
it
,
I
must
.
<EOS>
What
's
here
now
?
<EOS>
yes
,
faith
,
I
lamented
my
birthday
two
days
after
,
and
that
's
all
:
 
<EOS>
and
you
rhyme
,
Madam
Stella
;
were
those
verses
made
upon
my
birthday
?
<EOS>
faith
,
when
I
read
them
,
I
had
them
running
in
my
head
all
the
day
,
and
said
them
over
a
thousand
times
;
they
drank
your
health
in
all
their
glasses
,
and
wished
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
get
them
out
of
my
head
.
 
<EOS>
What
?
<EOS>
no
,
I
believe
it
was
not
;
what
do
I
say
upon
the
eighth
of
December
?
 
<EOS>
Compare
,
and
see
whether
I
say
so
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
glad
of
Mrs.
Stoyte
's
recovery
,
heartily
glad
;
your
Dolly
Manley
's
and
Bishop
of
Cloyne
's
child
I
have
no
concern
about
:
I
am
sorry
in
a
civil
way
,
that
's
all
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
yes
,
Sir
George
St.
George
dead
.
 
<EOS>
G
o
,
cry
,
Madam
Dingley
<EOS>
;
I
have
written
to
the
Dean
.
 
<EOS>
Raymond
will
be
rich
,
for
he
has
the
building
itch
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
all
he
has
got
may
put
him
out
of
debt
.
 
<EOS>
Poh
,
I
have
fires
like
lightning
;
they
cost
me
twelvepence
a
week
,
beside
small
coal
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
got
four
new
caps
,
madam
,
very
fine
and
convenient
,
with
striped
cambric
,
instead
of
muslin
;
so
Patrick
need
not
mend
them
,
but
take
the
old
ones
.
 
<EOS>
Stella
snatched
Dingley
's
word
out
of
her
pen
;
<EOS>
Presto
a
cold
?
 
<EOS>
Why
,
all
the
world
here
is
dead
with
them
:
 
<EOS>
I
never
had
anything
like
it
in
my
life
;
'
tis
not
gone
in
five
weeks
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
Leigh
is
with
you
before
this
,
and
has
brought
your
box
.
 
<EOS>
How
do
you
like
the
ivory
rasp
?
 
<EOS>
Stella
is
angry
;
but
I
'll
have
a
finer
thing
for
her
.
 
<EOS>
Is
not
the
apron
as
good
?
 
<EOS>
I
'm
sure
I
shall
never
be
paid
it
;
so
all
's
well
again
.
 
<EOS>
What
?
<EOS>
the
quarrel
with
Sir
John
Walter
?
 
<EOS>
Why
,
we
had
not
one
word
of
quarrel
;
only
he
railed
at
me
when
I
was
gone
:
 
and
Lord
Keeper
and
Treasurer
teased
me
for
a
week
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
nuts
to
them
;
a
serious
thing
with
a
vengeance
.
 
<EOS>
The
Whigs
may
sell
their
estates
then
,
or
hang
themselves
,
as
they
are
disposed
;
for
a
peace
there
will
be
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Treasurer
told
me
that
Connolly
was
going
to
Hanover
.
 
<EOS>
Your
Provost
is
a
coxcomb
.
 
<EOS>
Stella
is
a
good
girl
for
not
being
angry
when
I
tell
her
of
spelling
;
I
see
none
wrong
in
this
.
 
<EOS>
God
Almighty
be
praised
that
your
disorder
lessens
;
it
increases
my
hopes
mightily
that
they
will
go
off
.
<EOS>
And
have
you
been
plagued
with
the
fear
of
the
plague
?
<EOS>
never
mind
those
reports
;
I
have
heard
them
five
hundred
times
.
 
<EOS>
Replevi
?
 
<EOS>
Replevin
,
simpleton
,
'
tis
Dingley
<EOS>
I
mean
;
<EOS>
but
it
is
a
hard
word
,
and
so
I
'll
excuse
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
stated
Dingley
's
accounts
in
my
last
.
<EOS>
I
forgot
Catherine
's
sevenpenny
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
it
was
the
beef
-
steaks
;
I
'll
call
and
eat
them
in
spring
;
but
Goody
Stoyte
must
give
me
coffee
,
or
green
tea
,
for
I
drink
no
bohea
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
ay
,
the
pamphlet
;
but
there
are
some
additions
to
the
fourth
edition
;
the
fifth
edition
was
of
four
thousand
,
in
a
smaller
print
,
sold
for
sixpence
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
I
had
the
twenty
-
pound
bill
from
Parvisol
:
 
and
what
then
?
 
<EOS>
Pray
now
eat
the
Laracor
apples
;
I
beg
you
not
to
keep
them
,
but
tell
me
what
they
are
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
had
Tooke
's
bill
in
my
last
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
there
now
,
your
whole
letter
is
answered
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
you
what
I
do
;
I
lay
your
letter
before
me
,
and
take
it
in
order
,
and
answer
what
is
necessary
;
and
so
and
so
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
when
I
expected
we
were
all
undone
,
I
designed
to
retire
for
six
months
,
and
then
steal
over
to
Laracor
;
and
I
had
in
my
mouth
a
thousand
times
two
lines
of
Shakespeare
,
where
Cardinal
Wolsey
says
,
       
"
A
weak
old
man
,
battered
with
storms
of
state
,
      
<EOS>
Is
come
to
lay
his
weary
bones
among
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
beg
your
pardon
;
I
have
cheated
you
all
this
margin
,
I
did
not
perceive
it
;
and
I
went
on
wider
and
wider
like
Stella
;
awkward
sluts
<EOS>
;
SHE
WRITES
<EOS>
SO
SO
,
THERE
:
 
<EOS>
that
's
as
like
as
two
eggs
a
penny
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
weak
old
man
,
"
now
I
am
saying
it
,
and
shall
till
to
-
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
The
Duke
of
Marlborough
says
there
is
nothing
he
now
desires
so
much
as
to
contrive
some
way
how
to
soften
Dr.
Swift
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
mistaken
;
for
those
things
that
have
been
hardest
against
him
were
not
written
by
me
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Secretary
told
me
this
from
a
friend
of
the
Duke
's
;
and
I
'm
sure
now
he
is
down
,
I
shall
not
trample
on
him
;
although
I
love
him
not
,
I
dislike
his
being
out
.
 
<EOS>
Bernage
was
to
see
me
this
morning
,
and
gave
some
very
indifferent
excuses
for
not
calling
here
so
long
.
 
<EOS>
I
care
not
twopence
.
 
<EOS>
Prince
Eugene
did
not
dine
with
the
Duke
of
Marlborough
on
Sunday
,
but
was
last
night
at
Lady
Betty
Germaine
's
assemblee
,
and
a
vast
number
of
ladies
to
see
him
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Lewis
and
I
dined
with
a
private
friend
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
this
morning
to
see
the
Duke
of
Ormond
,
who
appointed
me
to
meet
him
at
the
Cockpit
at
one
,
but
never
came
.
 
<EOS>
I
sat
too
some
time
with
the
Duchess
.
 
<EOS>
We
do
n't
like
things
very
well
yet
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
come
home
early
,
and
going
to
be
busy
.
<EOS>
I
'll
go
write
.
  
<EOS>

.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
go
sleep
last
night
till
past
two
,
and
was
waked
before
three
by
a
noise
of
people
endeavouring
to
break
open
my
window
.
 
<EOS>
For
a
while
I
would
not
stir
,
thinking
it
might
be
my
imagination
;
but
hearing
the
noise
continued
,
I
rose
and
went
to
the
window
,
and
then
it
ceased
.
 
<EOS>
I
went
to
bed
again
,
and
heard
it
repeated
more
violently
;
then
I
rose
and
called
up
the
house
,
and
got
a
candle
:
 
<EOS>
the
rogues
had
lifted
up
the
sash
a
yard
;
there
are
great
sheds
before
my
windows
,
although
my
lodgings
be
a
storey
high
;
and
if
they
get
upon
the
sheds
they
are
almost
even
with
my
window
.
 
<EOS>
We
observed
their
track
,
and
panes
of
glass
fresh
broken
.
 
<EOS>
The
watchmen
told
us
to
-
day
they
saw
them
,
but
could
not
catch
them
.
 
<EOS>
They
attacked
others
in
the
neighbourhood
about
the
same
time
,
and
actually
robbed
a
house
in
Suffolk
Street
,
which
is
the
next
street
but
one
to
us
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
said
they
are
seamen
discharged
from
service
.
 
<EOS>
I
went
up
to
call
my
man
,
and
found
his
bed
empty
;
it
seems
he
often
lies
abroad
.
 
<EOS>
I
challenged
him
this
morning
as
one
of
the
robbers
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
a
sad
dog
;
and
the
minute
I
come
to
Ireland
I
will
discard
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
this
day
got
double
iron
bars
to
every
window
in
my
dining
-
room
and
bed
-
chamber
;
and
I
hide
my
purse
in
my
thread
stocking
between
the
bed
's
head
and
the
wainscot
.
 
<EOS>
Lewis
and
I
dined
with
an
old
Scotch
friend
,
who
brought
the
Duke
of
Douglas
and
three
or
four
more
Scots
upon
us
.
  
<EOS>
10
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
our
Society
day
,
you
know
;
but
the
Duke
of
Ormond
could
not
be
with
us
,
because
he
dined
with
Prince
Eugene
.
 
<EOS>
It
cost
me
a
guinea
contribution
to
a
poet
,
who
had
made
a
copy
of
verses
upon
monkeys
,
applying
the
story
to
the
Duke
of
Marlborough
;
the
rest
gave
two
guineas
,
except
the
two
physicians
,
who
followed
my
example
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
like
this
custom
:
 
<EOS>
the
next
time
I
will
give
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
I
sat
this
evening
at
Lord
Masham
's
with
Lord
Treasurer
:
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
like
his
countenance
;
nor
I
do
n't
like
the
posture
of
things
well
.
       
<EOS>
We
can
not
be
stout
,
     
<EOS>
Till
Somerset
's
out
:
  
as
the
old
saying
is
.
  
<EOS>
11
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Lewis
and
I
dined
with
the
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
,
who
eats
the
most
elegantly
of
any
man
I
know
in
town
.
 
<EOS>
I
walked
lustily
in
the
Park
by
moonshine
till
eight
,
to
shake
off
my
dinner
and
wine
;
and
then
went
to
sup
at
Mr.
Domville
's
with
Ford
,
and
stayed
till
twelve
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
told
me
to
-
day
as
a
great
secret
that
the
Duke
of
Somerset
will
be
out
soon
,
that
the
thing
is
fixed
;
but
what
shall
we
do
with
the
Duchess
?
 
<EOS>
They
say
the
Duke
will
make
her
leave
the
Queen
out
of
spite
,
if
he
be
out
.
 
<EOS>
It
has
stuck
upon
that
fear
<EOS>
a
good
while
already
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
but
Lewis
gave
me
a
letter
from
MD
,
N.25
.
 
<EOS>
O
Lord
,
I
did
not
expect
one
this
fortnight
,
faith
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
mighty
good
<EOS>
,
that
's
certain
:
 
<EOS>
but
I
wo
n't
answer
it
,
because
this
goes
to
-
morrow
,
only
what
you
say
of
the
printer
being
taken
up
;
I
value
it
not
;
all
's
safe
there
;
nor
do
I
fear
anything
,
unless
the
Ministry
be
changed
:
 
<EOS>
I
hope
that
danger
is
over
.
<EOS>
However
,
I
shall
be
in
Ireland
before
such
a
change
;
which
could
not
be
,
I
think
,
till
the
end
of
the
session
,
if
the
Whigs
'
designs
had
gone
on
.
 
<EOS>
Have
not
you
an
apron
by
Leigh
,
Madam
Stella
?
<EOS>
have
you
all
I
mentioned
in
a
former
letter
?
  
<EOS>
12
.
 
<EOS>
Morning
.
 
<EOS>
This
goes
to
-
day
as
usual
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
of
going
into
the
City
;
but
of
that
at
night
.

'
Tis
fine
moderate
weather
these

LETTER
39
.
 
<EOS>
LONDON
,
Jan.
12,1711
-
12
.
  
<EOS>
When
I
sealed
up
my
letter
this
morning
,
I
looked
upon
myself
to
be
not
worth
a
groat
in
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
Last
night
,
after
Mr.
Ford
and
I
left
Domville
,
Ford
desired
me
to
go
with
him
for
a
minute
upon
earnest
business
,
and
then
told
me
that
both
he
and
I
were
ruined
;
for
he
had
trusted
Stratford
with
five
hundred
pounds
for
tickets
for
the
lottery
,
and
he
had
been
with
Stratford
,
who
confessed
he
had
lost
fifteen
thousand
pounds
by
Sir
Stephen
Evans
,
who
broke
last
week
;
that
he
concluded
Stratford
must
break
too
;
that
he
could
not
get
his
tickets
,
but
Stratford
made
him
several
excuses
,
which
seemed
very
blind
ones
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
And
Stratford
had
near
four
hundred
pounds
of
mine
,
to
buy
me
five
hundred
pounds
in
the
South
Sea
Company
.
 
<EOS>
I
came
home
reflecting
a
little
;
nothing
concerned
me
but
MD
.
 
<EOS>
I
called
all
my
philosophy
and
religion
up
;
and
,
I
thank
God
,
it
did
not
keep
me
awake
beyond
my
usual
time
above
a
quarter
of
an
hour
.
 
<EOS>
This
morning
I
sent
for
Tooke
,
whom
I
had
employed
to
buy
the
stock
of
Stratford
,
and
settle
things
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
told
me
I
was
secure
;
for
Stratford
had
transferred
it
to
me
in
form
in
the
South
Sea
House
,
and
he
had
accepted
it
for
me
,
and
all
was
done
on
stamped
parchment
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
he
would
be
further
informed
;
and
at
night
sent
me
a
note
to
confirm
me
.
<EOS>
However
,
I
am
not
yet
secure
;
and
,
besides
,
am
in
pain
for
Ford
,
whom
I
first
brought
acquainted
with
Stratford
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
in
the
City
.
  
<EOS>
13
.
 
<EOS>
Domville
and
I
dined
with
Ford
to
-
day
by
appointment
:
 
the
Lord
Mansel
told
me
at
Court
to
-
day
that
I
was
engaged
to
him
;
but
Stratford
had
promised
Ford
to
meet
him
and
me
to
-
night
at
Ford
's
lodgings
.
 
<EOS>
He
did
so
;
said
he
had
hopes
to
save
himself
in
his
affair
with
Evans
.
 
<EOS>
Ford
asked
him
for
his
tickets
:
 
<EOS>
he
said
he
would
send
them
tomorrow
;
but
looking
in
his
pocket
-
book
,
said
he
believed
he
had
some
of
them
about
him
,
and
gave
him
as
many
as
came
to
two
hundred
pounds
,
which
rejoiced
us
much
;
besides
,
he
talked
so
frankly
,
that
we
might
think
there
is
no
danger
.
 
<EOS>
I
asked
him
,
Was
there
any
more
to
be
settled
between
us
in
my
affair
?
 
<EOS>
He
said
,
No
;
and
answered
my
questions
just
as
Tooke
had
got
them
from
others
;
so
I
hope
I
am
safe
.
 
<EOS>
This
has
been
a
scurvy
affair
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
Stella
would
have
half
laughed
at
me
,
to
see
a
suspicious
fellow
like
me
overreached
.
 
<EOS>
I
saw
Prince
Eugene
to
-
day
at
Court
:
I
do
n't
think
him
an
ugly
-
faced
fellow
,
but
well
enough
,
and
a
good
shape
.
  
<EOS>
14
.
 
<EOS>
The
Parliament
was
to
sit
to
-
day
,
and
met
;
but
were
adjourned
by
the
Queen
's
directions
till
Thursday
.
 
<EOS>
She
designs
to
make
some
important
speech
then
.
 
<EOS>
She
pretended
illness
;
but
I
believe
they
were
not
ready
,
and
they
expect
some
opposition
:
 
and
the
Scotch
lords
are
angry
,
and
must
be
pacified
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
this
morning
to
invite
the
Duke
of
Ormond
to
our
Society
on
Thursday
,
where
he
is
then
to
be
introduced
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
appointed
me
at
twelve
to
-
morrow
about
some
business
:
 
<EOS>
I
would
fain
have
his
help
to
impeach
a
certain
lord
;
but
I
doubt
we
shall
make
nothing
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
intended
to
have
dined
with
Lord
Treasurer
,
but
I
was
told
he
would
be
busy
:
 
<EOS>
so
I
dined
with
Mrs.
Van
;
and
at
night
I
sat
with
Lord
Masham
till
one
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Treasurer
was
there
,
and
chid
me
for
not
dining
with
him
:
 
<EOS>
he
was
in
very
good
humour
.
 
<EOS>
I
brought
home
two
flasks
of
burgundy
in
my
chair
:
 
<EOS>
I
wish
MD
had
them
.
 
<EOS>
You
see
it
is
very
late
;
so
I
'll
go
to
bed
,
and
bid
MD
good
night
.
  
<EOS>
15
.
 
<EOS>
This
morning
I
presented
my
printer
and
bookseller
to
Lord
Rivers
,
to
be
stationers
to
the
Ordnance
;
stationers
,
that
's
the
word
;
I
did
not
write
it
plain
at
first
.
<EOS>
I
believe
it
will
be
worth
three
hundred
pounds
a
year
between
them
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
the
third
employment
I
have
got
for
them
.
 
<EOS>
Rivers
told
them
the
Doctor
commanded
him
,
and
he
durst
not
refuse
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
have
dined
with
Lord
Treasurer
to
-
day
again
,
but
Lord
Mansel
would
not
let
me
,
and
forced
me
home
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
very
deep
with
the
Duke
of
Ormond
to
-
day
at
the
Cockpit
,
where
we
met
to
be
private
;
but
I
doubt
I
can
not
do
the
mischief
I
intended
.
<EOS>
My
friend
Penn
came
there
,
Will
Penn
the
Quaker
,
at
the
head
of
his
brethren
,
to
thank
the
Duke
for
his
kindness
to
their
people
in
Ireland
.
 
<EOS>
To
see
a
dozen
scoundrels
with
their
hats
on
,
and
the
Duke
complimenting
with
his
off
,
was
a
good
sight
enough
.
 
<EOS>
I
sat
this
evening
with
Sir
William
Robinson
,
who
has
mighty
often
invited
me
to
a
bottle
of
wine
:
 
<EOS>
and
it
is
past
twelve
.
  
<EOS>
16
.
 
<EOS>
This
being
fast
-
day
,
Dr.
Freind
and
I
went
into
the
City
to
dine
late
,
like
good
fasters
.
 
<EOS>
My
printer
and
bookseller
want
me
to
hook
in
another
employment
for
them
in
the
Tower
,
because
it
was
enjoyed
before
by
a
stationer
,
although
it
be
to
serve
the
Ordnance
with
oil
,
tallow
,
etc
.
,
and
is
worth
four
hundred
pounds
per
annum
more
:
 
I
will
try
what
I
can
do
.
 
<EOS>
They
are
resolved
to
ask
several
other
employments
of
the
same
nature
to
other
offices
;
and
I
will
then
grease
fat
sows
,
and
see
whether
it
be
possible
to
satisfy
them
.
 
<EOS>
Why
am
not
I
a
stationer
?
 
<EOS>
The
Parliament
sits
to
-
morrow
,
and
Walpole
,
late
Secretary
at
War
,
is
to
be
swinged
for
bribery
,
and
the
Queen
is
to
communicate
something
of
great
importance
to
the
two
Houses
,
at
least
they
say
so
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
must
think
of
answering
your
letter
in
a
day
or
two
.
  
<EOS>
17
.
 
<EOS>
I
went
this
morning
to
the
Duke
of
Ormond
about
some
business
,
and
he
told
me
he
could
not
dine
with
us
today
,
being
to
dine
with
Prince
Eugene
.
<EOS>
Those
of
our
Society
of
the
House
of
Commons
could
not
be
with
us
,
the
House
sitting
late
on
Walpole
.
 
<EOS>
I
left
them
at
nine
,
and
they
were
not
come
.
 
<EOS>
We
kept
some
dinner
for
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
Walpole
will
be
sent
to
the
Tower
,
and
expelled
the
House
;
but
this
afternoon
the
members
I
spoke
with
in
the
Court
of
Requests
talked
dubiously
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
will
be
a
leading
card
to
maul
the
Duke
of
Marlborough
for
the
same
crime
,
or
at
least
to
censure
him
.
 
<EOS>
The
Queen
's
message
was
only
to
give
them
notice
of
the
peace
she
is
treating
,
and
to
desire
they
will
make
some
law
to
prevent
libels
against
the
Government
;
so
farewell
to
Grub
Street
.
  
<EOS>
18
.
 
<EOS>
I
heard
to
-
day
that
the
commoners
of
our
Society
did
not
leave
the
Parliament
till
eleven
at
night
,
then
went
to
those
I
left
,
and
stayed
till
three
in
the
morning
.
 
<EOS>
Walpole
is
expelled
,
and
sent
to
the
Tower
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
this
morning
again
with
Lord
Rivers
,
and
have
made
him
give
the
other
employment
to
my
printer
and
bookseller
;
'
tis
worth
a
great
deal
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
with
my
friend
Lewis
privately
,
to
talk
over
affairs
.
 
<EOS>
We
want
to
have
this
Duke
of
Somerset
out
,
and
he
apprehends
it
will
not
be
,
but
I
hope
better
.
 
<EOS>
They
are
going
now
at
last
to
change
the
Commissioners
of
the
Customs
;
my
friend
Sir
Matthew
Dudley
will
be
out
,
and
three
more
,
and
Prior
will
be
in
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
made
Ford
copy
out
a
small
pamphlet
,
and
sent
it
to
the
press
,
that
I
might
not
be
known
for
author
;
'
tis
A
Letter
to
the
October
Club
,
if
ever
you
heard
of
such
a
thing
.
 
<EOS>
Methinks
this
letter
goes
on
but
slowly
for
almost
a
week
:
 
<EOS>
I
want
some
little
conversation
with
MD
,
and
to
know
what
they
are
doing
just
now
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
sick
of
politics
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
dined
with
Lord
Treasurer
these
three
weeks
:
he
chides
me
,
but
I
do
n't
care
:
 
I
do
n't
.
  
<EOS>

.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
to
-
day
with
Lord
Treasurer
:
 
<EOS>
this
is
his
day
of
choice
company
,
where
they
sometimes
admit
me
,
but
pretend
to
grumble
.
 
<EOS>
And
to
-
day
they
met
on
some
extraordinary
business
;
the
Keeper
,
Steward
,
both
Secretaries
,
Lord
Rivers
,
and
Lord
Anglesea
:
 
<EOS>
I
left
them
at
seven
,
and
came
away
,
and
have
been
writing
to
the
Bishop
of
Clogher
.
 
<EOS>
I
forgot
to
know
where
to
direct
to
him
since
Sir
George
St.
George
's
death
,
but
I
have
directed
to
the
same
house
<EOS>
:
you
must
tell
me
better
,
for
the
letter
is
sent
by
the
bellman
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
write
to
me
again
till
this
is
gone
,
I
charge
you
,
for
I
wo
n't
answer
two
letters
together
.
 
<EOS>
The
Duke
of
Somerset
is
out
,
and
was
with
his
yellow
liveries
at
Parliament
to
-
day
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
he
had
the
same
with
the
Queen
,
when
he
was
Master
of
the
Horse
:
 
<EOS>
we
hope
the
Duchess
will
follow
,
or
that
he
will
take
her
away
in
spite
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Treasurer
,
I
hope
,
has
now
saved
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
Has
the
Dean
received
my
letter
?
<EOS>
ask
him
at
cards
to
-
night
.
  
<EOS>
20
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
world
of
people
to
-
day
at
Court
to
see
Prince
Eugene
,
but
all
bit
,
for
he
did
not
come
.
 
<EOS>
I
saw
the
Duchess
of
Somerset
talking
with
the
Duke
of
Buckingham
;
she
looked
a
little
down
,
but
was
extremely
courteous
.
 
<EOS>
The
Queen
has
the
gout
,
but
is
not
in
much
pain
.
 
<EOS>
Must
I
fill
this
line
too
?
<EOS>
well
then
,
so
let
it
be
.
 
<EOS>
The
Duke
of
Beaufort
has
a
mighty
mind
to
come
into
our
Society
;
shall
we
let
him
?
 
<EOS>
I
spoke
to
the
Duke
of
Ormond
about
it
,
and
he
doubts
a
little
whether
to
let
him
in
or
no
.
 
<EOS>
They
say
the
Duke
of
Somerset
is
advised
by
his
friends
to
let
his
wife
stay
with
the
Queen
;
I
am
sorry
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
with
the
Secretary
to
-
day
,
with
mixed
company
;
I
do
n't
love
it
.
 
<EOS>
Our
Society
does
not
meet
till
Friday
,
because
Thursday
will
be
a
busy
day
in
the
House
of
Commons
,
<EOS>
for
then
the
Duke
of
Marlborough
's
bribery
is
to
be
examined
into
about
the
pension
paid
him
by
those
that
furnished
bread
to
the
army
.
  
<EOS>
21
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
five
times
with
the
Duke
of
Ormond
about
a
perfect
trifle
,
and
he
forgets
it
:
 
<EOS>
I
used
him
like
a
dog
this
morning
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
asked
to
-
day
by
several
in
the
Court
of
Requests
whether
it
was
true
that
the
author
of
the
Examiner
was
taken
up
in
an
action
of
twenty
thousand
pounds
by
the
Duke
of
Marlborough
?
 
<EOS>
I
dined
in
the
City
,
where
my
printer
showed
me
a
pamphlet
,
called
Advice
to
the
October
Club
,
which
he
said
was
sent
him
by
an
unknown
hand
:
 
<EOS>
I
commended
it
mightily
;
he
never
suspected
me
;
'
tis
a
twopenny
pamphlet
.
 
<EOS>
I
came
home
and
got
timely
to
bed
;
but
about
eleven
one
of
the
Secretary
's
servants
came
to
me
to
let
me
know
that
Lord
Treasurer
would
immediately
speak
to
me
at
Lord
Masham
's
upon
earnest
business
,
and
that
,
if
I
was
abed
,
I
should
rise
and
come
.
 
<EOS>
I
did
so
:
 
<EOS>
Lord
Treasurer
was
above
with
the
Queen
;
and
when
he
came
down
he
laughed
,
and
said
it
was
not
he
that
sent
for
me
:
 
<EOS>
the
business
was
of
no
great
importance
,
only
to
give
me
a
paper
,
which
might
have
been
done
to
-
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
I
stayed
with
them
till
past
one
,
and
then
got
to
bed
again
.
 
<EOS>
Pize
take
their
frolics
.
 
<EOS>
I
thought
to
have
answered
your
letter
.
  
<EOS>
22
.
 
<EOS>
Dr.
Gastrell
was
to
see
me
this
morning
:
 
<EOS>
he
is
an
eminent
divine
,
one
of
the
canons
of
Christ
Church
,
and
one
I
love
very
well
:
 
<EOS>
he
said
he
was
glad
to
find
I
was
not
with
James
Broad
.
 
<EOS>
I
asked
what
he
meant
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
"
says
he
,
"
have
you
not
seen
the
Grub
Street
paper
,
that
says
Dr.
Swift
was
taken
up
as
author
of
the
Examiner
,
on
an
action
of
twenty
thousand
pounds
,
and
was
now
at
James
Broad
's
?
<EOS>
"
who
,
I
suppose
,
is
some
bailiff
.
 
<EOS>
I
knew
of
this
;
but
at
the
Court
of
Requests
twenty
people
told
me
they
heard
I
had
been
taken
up
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Lansdowne
observed
to
the
Secretary
and
me
that
the
Whigs
spread
three
lies
yesterday
;
that
about
me
;
and
another
,
that
Maccartney
,
who
was
turned
out
last
summer
,
is
again
restored
to
his
places
in
the
army
;
and
the
third
,
that
Jack
Hill
's
commission
for
Lieutenant
of
the
Tower
is
stopped
,
and
that
Cadogan
is
to
continue
.
 
<EOS>
Lansdowne
thinks
they
have
some
design
by
these
reports
;
I
can
not
guess
it
.
 
<EOS>
Did
I
tell
you
that
Sacheverell
has
desired
mightily
to
come
and
see
me
?
<EOS>
but
I
have
put
it
off
:
 
<EOS>
he
has
heard
that
I
have
spoken
to
the
Secretary
in
behalf
of
a
brother
whom
he
maintains
,
and
who
desires
an
employment
.
 
<EOS>
T'other
day
at
the
Court
of
Requests
Dr.
Yalden
saluted
me
by
name
:
 
<EOS>
Sacheverell
,
who
was
just
by
,
came
up
to
me
,
and
made
me
many
acknowledgment
and
compliments
.
 
<EOS>
Last
night
I
desired
Lord
Treasurer
to
do
something
for
that
brother
of
Sacheverell
's
:
 
he
said
he
never
knew
he
had
a
brother
,
but
thanked
me
for
telling
him
,
and
immediately
put
his
name
in
his
table
-
book
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
let
Sacheverell
know
this
,
that
he
may
take
his
measures
accordingly
,
but
he
shall
be
none
of
my
acquaintance
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
to
-
day
privately
with
the
Secretary
,
left
him
at
six
,
paid
a
visit
or
two
,
and
came
home
.
  
<EOS>
23
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
again
to
-
day
with
the
Secretary
,
but
could
not
despatch
some
business
I
had
with
him
,
he
has
so
much
besides
upon
his
hands
at
this
juncture
,
and
preparing
against
the
great
business
to
-
morrow
,
which
we
are
top
full
of
.
 
<EOS>
The
Minister
's
design
is
that
the
Duke
of
Marlborough
shall
be
censured
as
gently
as
possible
,
provided
his
friends
will
not
make
head
to
defend
him
,
but
if
they
do
,
it
may
end
in
some
severer
votes
.
 
<EOS>
A
gentleman
,
who
was
just
now
with
him
,
tells
me
he
is
much
cast
down
,
and
fallen
away
;
but
he
is
positive
,
if
he
has
but
ten
friends
in
the
House
,
that
they
shall
defend
him
to
the
utmost
,
and
endeavour
to
prevent
the
least
censure
upon
him
,
which
I
think
can
not
be
,
since
the
bribery
is
manifest
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
Solomon
Medina
paid
him
six
thousand
pounds
a
year
to
have
the
employment
of
providing
bread
for
the
army
,
and
the
Duke
owns
it
in
his
letter
to
the
Commissioners
of
Accounts
.
<EOS>
I
was
to
-
night
at
Lord
Masham
's
:
 
Lord
Dupplin
took
out
my
new
little
pamphlet
,
and
the
Secretary
read
a
great
deal
of
it
to
Lord
Treasurer
:
 
<EOS>
they
all
commended
it
to
the
skies
,
and
so
did
I
,
and
they
began
a
health
to
the
author
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
doubt
Lord
Treasurer
suspected
;
for
he
said
,
"
This
is
Mr.
Davenant
's
style
,
"
which
is
his
ca
nt
when
he
suspects
me
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
carried
the
matter
very
well
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Treasurer
put
the
pamphlet
in
his
pocket
to
read
at
home
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
answer
your
letter
to
-
morrow
.
  
<EOS>
24
.
 
<EOS>
The
Secretary
made
me
promise
to
dine
with
him
today
,
after
the
Parliament
was
up
:
 
<EOS>
I
said
I
would
come
;
but
<EOS>
I
dined
at
my
usual
time
,
knowing
the
House
would
sit
late
on
this
great
affair
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
at
a
tavern
with
Mr.
Domville
and
another
gentleman
;
I
have
not
done
so
before
these
many
months
.
<EOS>
At
ten
this
evening
I
went
to
the
Secretary
,
but
he
was
not
come
home
:
 
<EOS>
I
sat
with
his
lady
till
twelve
,
then
came
away
;
and
he
just
came
as
I
was
gone
,
and
he
sent
to
my
lodgings
,
but
I
would
not
go
back
;
and
<EOS>
so
I
know
not
how
things
have
passed
,
but
hope
all
is
well
;
and
I
will
tell
you
to
-
morrow
day
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
late
,
etc
.
  
<EOS>
25
.
 
<EOS>
The
Secretary
sent
to
me
this
morning
to
know
whether
we
should
dine
together
.
 
<EOS>
I
went
to
him
,
and
there
I
learned
that
the
question
went
against
the
Duke
of
Marlborough
,
by
a
majority
of
a
hundred
;
so
<EOS>
the
Ministry
is
mighty
well
satisfied
,
and
the
Duke
will
now
be
able
to
do
no
hurt
.
 
<EOS>
The
Secretary
and
I
,
and
Lord
Masham
,
etc
.
,
dined
with
Lieutenant
-
General
Withers
,
who
is
just
going
to
look
after
the
army
in
Flanders
:
 
the
Secretary
<EOS>
and
I
left
them
a
little
after
seven
,
and
I
am
come
home
,
and
will
now
answer
your
letter
,
because
this
goes
to
-
morrow
:
 
<EOS>
let
me
see
 
The
box
at
Chester
;
<EOS>
oh
,
burn
that
box
,
and
hang
that
Sterne
;
I
have
desired
one
to
inquire
for
it
who
went
toward
Ireland
last
Monday
,
but
I
am
in
utter
despair
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
I
was
not
splenetic
;
you
see
what
plunges
the
Court
has
been
at
to
set
all
right
again
.
<EOS>
And
that
Duchess
is
not
out
yet
,
and
may
one
day
cause
more
mischief
.
<EOS>
Somerset
shows
all
about
a
letter
from
the
Queen
,
desiring
him
to
let
his
wife
continue
with
her
.
 
<EOS>
Is
not
that
rare
!
 
<EOS>
I
find
Dingley
smelled
a
rat
;
because
the
Whigs
are
UPISH
;
<EOS>
but
if
ever
I
hear
that
word
again
,
I
'll
UPPISH
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
glad
you
got
your
rasp
safe
and
sound
;
does
Stella
like
her
apron
?
 
<EOS>
Your
critics
about
guarantees
of
succession
are
puppies
;
that
's
an
answer
to
the
objection
.
 
<EOS>
The
answerers
here
made
the
same
objection
,
but
it
is
wholly
wrong
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
of
your
opinion
that
Lord
Marlborough
is
used
too
hardly
:
 
<EOS>
I
have
often
scratched
out
passages
from
papers
and
pamphlets
<EOS>
sent
me
,
before
they
were
printed
,
because
I
thought
them
too
severe
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
is
certainly
a
vile
man
,
and
has
no
sort
of
merit
beside
the
military
.
 
<EOS>
The
Examiners
are
good
for
little
:
 
I
would
fain
have
hindered
the
severity
of
the
two
or
three
last
,
but
could
not
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
either
bring
your
papers
over
,
or
leave
them
with
Tooke
,
for
whose
honesty
I
will
engage
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
think
it
is
best
not
to
venture
them
with
me
at
sea
.
 
<EOS>
Stella
is
a
prophet
,
by
foretelling
so
very
positively
that
all
would
be
well
.
 
<EOS>
Duke
of
Ormond
speak
against
peace
?
 
<EOS>
No
,
simpleton
,
he
is
one
of
the
staunchest
we
have
for
the
Ministry
.
 
<EOS>
Neither
trouble
yourself
about
the
printer
:
 
<EOS>
he
appeared
the
first
day
of
the
term
,
and
is
to
appear
when
summoned
again
;
but
nothing
else
will
come
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Chief
-
Justice
is
cooled
since
this
new
settlement
.
 
<EOS>
No
<EOS>
;
I
will
not
split
my
journals
in
half
;
I
will
write
but
once
a
fortnight
:
 
<EOS>
but
you
may
do
as
you
will
;
which
is
,
read
only
half
at
once
,
and
t'other
half
next
week
.
 
<EOS>
So
now
your
letter
is
answered
.
 
<EOS>
(
P
#
#
#
#
on
these
blots
.
)
 
<EOS>
What
must
I
say
more
?
 
<EOS>
I
will
set
out
in
March
,
if
there
be
a
fit
of
fine
weather
;
unless
the
Ministry
desire
me
to
stay
till
the
end
of
the
session
,
which
may
be
a
month
longer
;
but
I
believe
they
will
not
:
 
for
I
suppose
the
peace
will
be
made
,
and
they
will
have
no
further
service
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
make
my
canal
fine
this
summer
,
as
fine
as
I
can
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
afraid
I
shall
see
great
neglects
among
my
quicksets
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
the
cherry
-
trees
on
the
river
walk
are
fine
things
now
.
 
<EOS>
But
no
more
of
this
.
  
<EOS>
26
.
 
<EOS>
I
forgot
to
finish
this
letter
this
morning
,
and
am
come
home
<EOS>
so
late
I
must
give
it
to
the
bellman
;
but
I
would
have
it
go
to
-
night
,
lest
you
should
think
there
is
anything
in
the
story
of
my
being
arrested
in
an
action
of
twenty
thousand
pounds
by
Lord
Marlborough
,
which
I
hear
is
in
Dyer
's
Letter
,
and
,
consequently
,
I
suppose
,
gone
to
Ireland
.
 
<EOS>
Farewell

LETTER

<EOS>
LONDON
,
Jan.
26
,
1711
-
12
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
no
gilt
paper
left
of
this
size
,
so
you
must
be
content
with
plain
.
<EOS>
Our
Society
dined
together
today
,
for
it
was
put
off
,
as
I
told
you
,
upon
Lord
Marlborough
's
business
on
Thursday
.
 
<EOS>
The
Duke
of
Ormond
dined
with
us
to
-
day
,
the
first
time
:
 
<EOS>
we
were
thirteen
at
table
;
and
Lord
Lansdowne
came
in
after
dinner
,
so
that
we
wanted
but
three
.
 
<EOS>
The
Secretary
proposed
the
Duke
of
Beaufort
,
who
desires
to
be
one
of
our
Society
;
but
I
stopped
it
,
because
the
Duke
of
Ormond
doubts
a
little
about
it
;
and
he
was
gone
before
it
was
proposed
.
 
<EOS>
I
left
them
at
seven
,
and
sat
this
evening
with
poor
Mrs.
Wesley
,
who
has
been
mightily
ill
to
-
day
with
a
fainting
fit
;
she
has
often
convulsions
,
too
:
 
<EOS>
she
takes
a
mixture
with
asafoetida
,
which
I
have
now
in
my
nose
,
and
everything
smells
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
smelt
it
before
;
'
tis
abominable
.
<EOS>
We
have
eight
packets
,
they
say
,
due
from
Ireland
.
  
<EOS>

.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
see
Prince
Eugene
at
Court
to
-
day
,
the
crowd
was
so
great
.
<EOS>
The
Whigs
contrive
to
have
a
crowd
always
about
him
,
and
employ
the
rabble
to
give
the
word
,
when
he
sets
out
from
any
place
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
Duchess
of
Hamilton
came
from
the
Queen
after
church
,
she
whispered
me
that
she
was
going
to
pay
me
a
visit
.
 
<EOS>
I
went
to
Lady
Oglethorpe
's
,
the
place
appointed
;
for
ladies
always
visit
me
in
third
places
;
and
she
kept
me
till
near
four
:
 
<EOS>
she
talks
too
much
,
is
a
plaguy
detractor
,
and
I
believe
I
shall
not
much
like
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
engaged
to
dine
with
Lord
Masham
:
 
<EOS>
they
stayed
as
long
as
they
could
,
yet
had
almost
dined
,
and
were
going
in
anger
to
pull
down
the
brass
peg
for
my
hat
,
but
Lady
Masham
saved
it
.
 
<EOS>
At
eight
I
went
again
to
Lord
Masham
's
;
Lord
Treasurer
is
generally
there
at
night
:
 
<EOS>
we
sat
up
till
almost
two
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Treasurer
has
engaged
me
to
contrive
some
way
to
keep
the
Archbishop
of
York
from
being
seduced
by
Lord
Nottingham
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
do
what
I
can
in
it
to
-
morrow
.
'
<EOS>
Tis
very
late
,
so
I
must
go
sleep
.

<EOS>
Poor
Mrs.
Manley
,
the
author
,
is
very
ill
of
a
dropsy
and
sore
leg
:
 
<EOS>
the
printer
tells
me
he
is
afraid
she
can
not
live
long
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
heartily
sorry
for
her
:
 
<EOS>
she
has
very
generous
principles
for
one
of
her
sort
,
and
a
great
deal
of
good
sense
and
invention
:
 
<EOS>
she
is
about
forty
,
very
homely
,
and
very
fat
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Van
made
me
dine
with
her
to
-
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
this
morning
with
the
Duke
of
Ormond
and
the
Prolocutor
about
what
Lord
Treasurer
spoke
to
me
yesterday
;
I
know
not
what
will
be
the
issue
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
but
a
slender
majority
in
the
House
of
Lords
,
and
we
want
more
.
 
<EOS>
We
are
sadly
mortified
at
the
news
of
the
French
taking
the
town
in
Brazil
from
the
Portuguese
.
 
<EOS>
The
sixth
edition
of
three
thousand
of
the
Conduct
of
the
Allies
is
sold
,
and
the
printer
talks
of
a
seventh
:
 
eleven
thousand
of
them
have
been
sold
,
which
is
a
most
prodigious
run
.
 
<EOS>
The
little
twopenny
Letter
of
Advice
to
the
October
Club
does
not
sell
:
I
know
not
the
reason
,
<EOS>
for
it
is
finely
written
,
I
assure
you
;
and
,
like
a
true
author
,
I
grow
fond
of
it
,
because
it
does
not
sell
:
 
you
know
that
it
is
usual
to
writers
to
condemn
the
judgment
of
the
world
:
 
if
I
had
hinted
it
to
be
mine
,
everybody
would
have
bought
it
,
but
it
is
a
great
secret
.
  
<EOS>

<EOS>
I
borrowed
one
or
two
idle
books
of
Contes
des
Fees
,
and
have
been
reading
them
these
two
days
,
although
I
have
much
business
upon
my
hands
.
 
<EOS>
I
loitered
till
one
at
home
;
then
went
to
Mr.
Lewis
at
his
office
;
and
the
Vice
-
Chamberlain
told
me
that
Lady
Rialton
had
yesterday
resigned
her
employment
of
lady
of
the
bed
-
chamber
,
and
that
Lady
Jane
Hyde
,
Lord
Rochester
's
daughter
,
a
mighty
pretty
girl
,
is
to
succeed
.
 
<EOS>
He
said
,
too
,
that
Lady
Sunderland
would
resign
in
a
day
or
two
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
with
Lewis
,
and
then
went
to
see
Mrs.
Wesley
,
who
is
better
to
-
day
.
 
<EOS>
But
you
must
know
that
Mr.
Lewis
gave
me
two
letters
,
one
from
the
Bishop
of
Cloyne
,
with
an
enclosed
from
Lord
Inchiquin
to
Lord
Treasurer
,
which
he
desires
I
would
deliver
and
recommend
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
told
that
lord
was
much
in
with
Lord
Wharton
,
and
I
remember
he
was
to
have
been
one
of
the
Lords
Justices
by
his
recommendation
;
yet
the
Bishop
recommends
him
as
a
great
friend
to
the
Church
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
do
what
I
think
proper
.
 
<EOS>
T'other
letter
was
from
little
saucy
MD
,
N.26
.
 
<EOS>
O
Lord
,
never
saw
the
like
,
under
a
cover
,
too
,
and
by
way
of
journal
;
we
shall
never
have
done
.
 
<EOS>
Sirrahs
,
how
durst
you
write
so
soon
,
sirrahs
?
 
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
answer
it
yet
.

<EOS>
I
was
this
morning
with
the
Secretary
,
who
was
sick
,
and
out
of
humour
<EOS>
:
he
would
needs
drink
champagne
some
days
ago
,
on
purpose
to
spite
me
,
because
I
advised
him
against
it
,
and
now
he
pays
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
Stella
used
to
do
such
tricks
formerly
;
he
put
me
in
mind
of
her
.
 
<EOS>
Lady
Sunderland
has
resigned
her
place
too
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
Lady
Catherine
Hyde
that
succeeds
Lady
Rialton
,
and
not
Lady
Jane
.
 
<EOS>
Lady
Catherine
is
the
late
Earl
of
Rochester
's
daughter
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
with
the
Secretary
,
then
visited
his
lady
;
and
sat
this
evening
with
Lady
Masham
:
 
the
Secretary
came
to
us
;
but
Lord
Treasurer
did
not
;
he
dined
with
the
Master
of
the
Rolls
,
and
stayed
late
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
Our
Society
does
not
meet
till
to
-
morrow
se'nnight
,
because
we
think
the
Parliament
will
be
very
busy
to
-
morrow
upon
the
state
of
the
war
,
and
the
Secretary
,
who
is
to
treat
as
President
,
must
be
in
the
House
.
 
<EOS>
I
fancy
my
talking
of
persons
and
things
here
<EOS>
must
be
very
tedious
to
you
,
because
you
know
nothing
of
them
,
and
I
talk
as
if
you
did
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
Kevin
's
Street
,
and
Werburgh
Street
,
<EOS>
and
(
what
do
you
call
the
street
where
Mrs.
Walls
lives
?
)
<EOS>
and
Ingoldsby

Higgins
,
and
Lord
Santry

but
<EOS>
what
care
you
for
Lady
Catherine
Hyde
?
 
<EOS>
Why
do
you
say
nothing
of
your
health

hope
it
is
well

Trimnel
,
Bishop
of
Norwich
,
who
was
with
this
Lord
Sunderland
at
Moor
Park
in
their
travels
,
preached
yesterday
before
the
House
of
Lords
;
and
to
-
day
the
question
was
put
to
thank
him
,
and
print
his
sermon
;
but
passed
against
him
;
for
it
was
a
terrible
Whig
sermon
.
 
<EOS>
The
Bill
to
repeal
the
Act
for
naturalising
Protestant
foreigners
passed
the
House
of
Lords
to
-
day
by
a
majority
of
twenty
,
though
the
Scotch
lords
went
out
,
and
would
vote
neither
way
,
in
discontent
about
the
Duke
of
Hamilton
's
patent

you
know
anything
of
it

A
poem
is
come
out
to
-
day
inscribed
to
me
,
by
way
of
a
flirt
;
for
it
is
a
Whiggish
poem
,
and
good
for
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
They
plagued
me
with
it
in
the
Court
of
Requests
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
with
Lord
Treasurer
at
five
alone
,
only
with
one
Dutchman
.
 
<EOS>
Prior
is
now
a
Commissioner
of
the
Customs

I
told
you
so
before

I
suppose

When
I
came
home
to
-
night
,
I
found
a
letter
from
Dr.
Sacheverell
,
thanking
me
for
recommending
his
brother
to
Lord
Treasurer
and
Mr.
Secretary
for
a
place
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Treasurer
sent
to
him
about
it
:
 
<EOS>
so
good
<EOS>
a
solicitor
was
I
,
although
I
once
hardly
thought
I
should
be
a
solicitor
for
Sacheverell
.

Has
not
your
Dean
of
St.
Patrick
received
my
letter
?
<EOS>
you
say
nothing
of
it
,
although
I
writ
above
a
month

.
 
<EOS>
My
printer
has
got
the
gout
,
and
I
was
forced
to
go
to
him
to
-
day
,
and
there
I
dined
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
most
delicious
day
:
 
<EOS>
why
do
n't
you
observe
whether
the

days
be
fine
with
you

<EOS>
To

night
,
at
six
,
Dr.
Atterbury
,
and
Prior
,
and
I

Dr.

met
at
Dr.
Robert
Freind

house
at
Westminster
,
who
is
master
of
the
school
:
 
there
<EOS>
we
sat
till
one

and
were
good
enough
company
.
 
<EOS>
I
here
take
leave
to
tell
politic
Dingley
that
the
passage
in
the
Conduct
of
the
Allies
is
so
far
from
being
blamable
that
the
Secretary
designs
to
insist
upon
it
in
the
House
of
Commons
,
when
the
Treaty
of
Barrier
is
debated
there
,
as
it
now
shortly
will
,
for
they
have
ordered
it
to
be
laid
before
them

The

This
ends
Christmas
,
and
what
care
I
?
 
<EOS>
I
have
neither
seen

heard
any
Christmas
this
year

<EOS>
I
passed
a
lazy
dull
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
this
morning
with
Lord
Treasurer
,
to
get
some
papers
from
him
,
which
he
will
remember
as
much
as
a
cat
,
although
it
be
his
own
business
.
 
<EOS>
It
threatened
rain
,
but
did
not
much
;
and
Prior
and
I
walked
an
hour
in
the
Park
,
which
quite
put
me
out
of
my
measures
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
with
a
friend
hard
by
;
and
in
the
evening
sat
with
Lord
Masham
till
twelve
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Treasurer
did
not
come
;
this
is
an
idle
dining
-
day
usually
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
We
want
to
hear
from
Holland
how
our
peace
goes
on
;
for
we
are
afraid
of
those
scoundrels
the
Dutch
,
lest
they
should
play
us
tricks
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Mar
,
a
Scotch
earl
,
was
with
us
at
Lord
Masham
's
:
 
<EOS>
I
was
arguing
with
him
about
the
stubbornness
and
folly
of
his
countrymen
;
they
are
so
angry
about
the
affair
of
the
Duke
of
Hamilton
,
whom
the
Queen
has
made
a
duke
of
England
,
and
the
House
of
Lords
will
not
admit
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
swears
he
would
vote
for
us
,
but
dare
not
,
because
all
Scotland
would
detest
him
if
he
did
:
 
he
should
never
be
chosen
again
,
nor
be
able
to
live
there
.

<EOS>
I
was
at
Court
to
-
day
to
look
for
a
dinner
,
but
did
not
like
any
that
were
offered
me
;
and
I
dined
with
Lord
Mountjoy
.
 
<EOS>
The
Queen
has
the
gout
in
her
knee
,
and
was
not
at
chapel
.
 
<EOS>
I
hear
we
have
a
Dutch
mail
,
but
<EOS>
I
know
not
what
news
,
although
I
was
with
the
Secretary
this
morning
.
 
<EOS>
He
showed
me
a
letter
from
the
Hanover
Envoy
,
Mr.
Bothmar
,
complaining
that
the
Barrier
Treaty
is
laid
before
the
House
of
Commons
;
and
desiring
that
no
infringement
may
be
made
in
the
guarantee
of
the
succession
;
but
the
Secretary
has
written
him
a
peppering
answer
.
 
<EOS>
I
fancy
<EOS>
you
understand
all
this
,
and
are
able
states
-
girls
,
since
you
have
read
the
Conduct
of
the
Allies
.
 
<EOS>
We
are
all
preparing
against
the
Birthday
;
I
think
it
is
Wednesday
next
.
 
<EOS>
If
the
Queen
's
gout
increases
,
it
will
spoil
sport
.
 
<EOS>
Prince
Eugene
has
two
fine
suits
made
against
it
;
and
the
Queen
is
to
give
him
a
sword
worth
four
thousand
pounds
,
the
diamonds
set
transparent
.

I
was
this
morning
soliciting
at
the
House
of
Commons
'
door
for
Mr.
Vesey
,
a
son
of
the
Archbishop
of
Tuam
,
who
has
petitioned
for
a
Bill
to
relieve
him
in
some
difficulty
about
his
estate
:
 
<EOS>
I
secured
him
above
fifty
members
.
<EOS>
I
dined
with
Lady
Masham
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
no
packet
from
Holland
,
as
I
was
told
yesterday
:
 
and
this
wind
will
hinder
many
people
from
appearing
at
the
Birthday
,
who
expected
clothes
from
Holland
.
 
<EOS>
I
appointed
to
meet
a
gentleman
at
the
Secretary
's
to
-
night
,
and
they
both
failed
.
 
<EOS>
The
House
of
Commons
have
this
day
made
many
severe
votes
about
our
being
abused
by
our
Allies
.
 
<EOS>
Those
who
spoke
drew
all
their
arguments
from
my
book
,
and
their
votes
confirm
all
I
writ
;
the
Court
had
a
majority
of
a
hundred
and
fifty
:
 
<EOS>
all
agree
that
it
was
my
book
that
spirited
them
to
these
resolutions
;
I
long
to
see
them
in
print
.
<EOS>
My
head
has
not
been
as
well
as
I
could
wish
it
for
some
days
past
,
but
I
have
not
had
any
giddy
fit
,
and
I
hope
it
will
go
over
.

The
Secretary
turned
me
out
of
his
room
this
morning
,
and
showed
me
fifty
guineas
rolled
up
,
which
he
was
going
to
give
some
French
spy
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
with
four
Irishmen
at
a
tavern
to

day

I

resolved
against
it
before
,
but
I
broke
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
played
at
cards
this
evening
at
Lady
Masham
's
,
but
I
only
played
for
her
while
she
was
waiting
;
and
I
won
her
a
pool
,
and
supped
there
.
<EOS>
Lord
Treasurer
was
with
us
,
but
went
away
before
twelve
.
 
<EOS>
The
ladies
and
lords
have
all
their
clothes
ready
against
to
-
morrow
:
 
<EOS>
I
saw
several
mighty
fine
,
and
I
hope
there
will
be
a
great
appearance
,
in
spite
of
that
spiteful
French
fashion
of
the
Whiggish
ladies
not
to
come
,
which
they
have
all
resolved
to
a
woman
;
and
I
hope
it
will
more
spirit
the
Queen
against
them
for
ever
.

<EOS>
I
went
to
dine
at
Lord
Masham
's
at
three
,
and
met
all
the
company
just
coming
out
of
Court
;
a
mighty
crowd
:
 
<EOS>
they
stayed
long
for
their
coaches
:
 
<EOS>
I
had
an
opportunity
of
seeing
several
lords
and
ladies
of
my
acquaintance
in
their
fineries
.
 
<EOS>
Lady
Ashburnham
looked
the
best
in
my
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
They
say
the
Court
was
never
fuller
nor
finer
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Treasurer
,
his
lady
,
and
two
daughters
and
Mrs.
Hill
,
dined
with
Lord
and
Lady
Masham
;
the
five
ladies
were
monstrous
fine
.
 
<EOS>
The
Queen
gave
Prince
Eugene
the
diamond
sword
to
-
day
;
but
nobody
was
by
when
she
gave
it
except
my
Lord
Chamberlain
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
an
entertainment
of
opera
songs
at
night
,
and
the
Queen
was
at
all
the
entertainment
,
and
is
very
well
after
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
saw
Lady
Wharton
,
as
ugly
as
the
devil
,
coming
out
in
the
crowd
all
in
an
undress
;
she
has
been
with
the
Marlborough
daughters
and
Lady
Bridgewater
in
St.
James
's
,
looking
out
of
the
window
<EOS>
all
undressed
to
see
the
sight
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
hear
that
one
Whig
lady
was
there
,
except
those
of
the
bed
-
chamber
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
has
made
so
great
a
noise
as
one
Kelson
's
chariot
,
that
cost
nine
hundred
and
thirty
pounds
,
the
finest
was
ever
seen
.
 
<EOS>
The
rabble
huzzaed
him
as
much
as
they
did
Prince
Eugene
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
Birthday
chat
.
  
<EOS>

.
 
<EOS>
Our
Society
met
to
-
day
:
 
<EOS>
the
Duke
of
Ormond
was
not
with
us
;
we
have
lessened
our
dinners
,
which
were
grown
so
extravagant
that
Lord
Treasurer
and
everybody
else
cried
shame
.
 
<EOS>
I
left
them
at
seven
,
visited
for
an
hour
,
and
then
came
home
,
like
a
good
boy
.
 
<EOS>
The
Queen
is
much
better
after
yesterday
's
exercise
:
 
<EOS>
her
friends
wish
she
would
use
a
little
more
.
 
<EOS>
I
opposed
Lord
Jersey
's
election
into
our
Society
,
and
he
is
refused
:
 
<EOS>
I
likewise
opposed
the
Duke
of
Beaufort
;
but
I
believe
he
will
be
chosen
in
spite
of
me
:
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
much
care
<EOS>
;
I
shall
not
be
with
them
above
two
months
;
for
I
resolve
to
set
out
for
Ireland
the
beginning
of
April
next
(
before
I
treat
them
again
)
,
and
see
my
willows
.

<EOS>
I
dined
to
-
day
in
the
City
.
 
<EOS>
This
morning
a
scoundrel
dog
,
one
of
the
Queen
's
music
,
a
German
,
whom
I
had
never
seen
,
got
access
to
me
in
my
chamber
by
Patrick
's
folly
,
and
gravely
desired
me
to
get
an
employment
in
the
Customs
for
a
friend
of
his
,
who
would
be
very
grateful
;
and
likewise
to
forward
a
project
of
his
own
,
for
raising
ten
thousand
pounds
a
year
upon
operas
:
 
<EOS>
I
used
him
civiller
than
he
deserved
;
but
it
vexed
me
to
the
pluck
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
told
I
had
a
mighty
interest
with
Lord
Treasurer
,
and
one
word
of
mine
,
etc
.
<EOS>
Well
;
I
got
home
early
on
purpose
to
answer
MD
's
letter
,
N.26
;
for
this
goes
to
-
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
Well
;
I
never
saw
such
a
letter
in
all
my
life
;
so
saucy
,
<EOS>
so
journalish
,
so
sanguine
,
<EOS>
so
pretending
,
so
everything
.
 
<EOS>
I
satisfied
all
your
fears
in
my
last
:
 
<EOS>
all
is
gone
well
,
as
you
say
;
yet
you
are
an
impudent
slut
to
be
so
positive
;
you
will
swagger
so
upon
your
sagacity
that
we
shall
never
have
done
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
do
n't
mislay
your
reply
;
I
would
certainly
print
it
,
if
I
had
it
here
:
 
<EOS>
how
long
is
it
?
<EOS>
I
suppose
half
a
sheet
:
 
was
the
answer
written
in
Ireland
?
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
yes
,
you
shall
have
a
letter
when
you
come
from
Ballygall
.
 
<EOS>
I
need
not
tell
you
again
who
's
out
and
who
's
in
:
 
we
can
never
get
out
the
Duchess
of
Somerset
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
they
say
Presto
writ
the
Conduct
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
Do
they
like
it
?
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
care
whether
they
do
or
no
;
but
the
resolutions
printed
t'other
day
in
the
Votes
are
almost
quotations
from
it
,
and
would
never
have
passed
if
that
book
had
not
been
written
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
not
meddle
with
the
Spectator
,
let
him
fair
-
sex
it
to
the
world
's
end
.
 
<EOS>
My
disorder
is
over
,
but
blood
was
not
from
the
p
-
les
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
Madam
Dingley
,
the
frost
;
why
,
we
had
a
great
frost
,
but
I
forget
how
long
ago
;
it
lasted
above
a
week
or
ten
days
:
 
<EOS>
I
believe
about
six
weeks
ago
;
but
it
did
not
break
so
soon
with
us
,
I
think
,
as
December
29
;
yet
I
think
it
was
about
that
time
,
on
second
thoughts
.
 
<EOS>
MD
can
have
no
letter
from
Presto
,
says
you
;
and
yet
four
days
before
you
own
<EOS>
you
had
my
thirty
-
seventh
,
unreasonable
sluts
!
 
<EOS>
The
Bishop
of
Gloucester
is
not
dead
,
and
I
am
as
likely
to
succeed
the
Duke
of
Marlborough
as
him
if
he
were
;
there
's
enough
for
that
now
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
not
unlikely
that
the
Duke
of
Shrewsbury
will
be
your
Governor
;
at
least
I
believe
the
Duke
of
Ormond
will
not
return
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
Stella
again
:
 
<EOS>
why
,
really
three
editions
of
the
Conduct
,
etc
.
,
is
very
much
for
Ireland
;
it
is
a
sign
you
have
some
honest
among
you
.
 
<EOS>
Well
;
I
will
do
Mr.
Manley
all
the
service
I
can
;
but
he
will
ruin
himself
.
 
<EOS>
What
business
had
he
to
engage
at
all
about
the
City
?
 
<EOS>
Ca
n't
he
wish
his
cause
well
,
and
be
quiet
,
when
he
finds
that
stirring
will
do
it
no
good
,
and
himself
a
great
deal
of
hurt
?
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
imagine
who
should
open
my
letter
:
 
<EOS>
it
must
be
done
at
your
side
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
hear
of
any
thoughts
of
turning
out
Mr.
Manley
,
I
will
endeavour
to
prevent
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
already
had
all
the
gentlemen
of
Ireland
here
upon
my
back
often
,
for
defending
him
.
 
<EOS>
So
now
I
have
answered
your
saucy
letter
.
 
<EOS>
My
humble
service
to
Goody
Stoyte
and
Catherine
<EOS>
;
I
will
come
soon
for
my
dinner
.
  
<EOS>

<EOS>
Morning

<EOS>
My
cold
goes
off
at
last
;
but
I
think
I
have
got
a
small
new
one
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
news
since
last
.
 
<EOS>
They
say
we
hear
by
the
way
of
Calais
,
that
peace
is
very
near
concluding
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
it
may
be
true
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
go
and
seal
up
my
letter
,
and
give
it
myself
to
-
night
into
the
post
-
office
;
and
<EOS>
so
I
bid
my
dearest
MD
farewell
till
to
-
night
.
 
<EOS>
I
heartily
wish
myself
with
them
,
as
hope
saved
.
 
<EOS>
My
willows
,
and
quicksets
,
and
trees
,
will
be
finely
improved
,
I
hope
,
this
year
.
 
<EOS>
It
has
been
fine
hard
frosty
weather
yesterday
and
to

day
.
<EOS>
Farewell

LETTER

<EOS>
LONDON
,
Feb.

1711
-
12
.
  
<EOS>
When
my
letter
is
gone
,
and
I
have
none
of
yours
to
answer
,
my
conscience
is
so
clear
,
and
my
shoulder
so
light
,
and
I
go
on
with
such
courage
to
prate
upon
nothing
to
deerichar
MD
,
oo
would
wonder
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
with
Sir
Matthew
Dudley
,
who
is
newly
turned
out
of
Commission
of
the
Customs
.
 
<EOS>
He
affects
a
good
heart
,
and
talks
in
the
extremity
of
Whiggery
,
which
was
always
his
principle
,
though
he
was
gentle
a
little
,
while
he
kept
in
employment
.
 
<EOS>
We
can
yet
get
no
packets
from
Holland
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
been
with
any
of
the
Ministry
these
two
or
three
days
.
 
<EOS>
I
keep
out
of
their
way
on
purpose
,
for
a
certain
reason
,
for
some
time
,
though
I
must
dine
with
the
Secretary
to
-
morrow
,
the
choosing
of
the
company
being
left
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
engaged
Lord
Anglesea
and
Lord
Carteret
,
and
have
promised
to
get
three
more
;
but
I
have
a
mind
that
none
else
should
be
admitted
:
 
however
,
if
I
like
anybody
at
Court
to
-
morrow
,
I
may
perhaps
invite
them
.

I
have
got
another
cold

not
very
bad

I
saw
Prince
Eugene
at
Court
to
-
day
very
plain
;
he
's
plaguy
yellow
,
and
tolerably
ugly
besides
.
 
<EOS>
The
Court
was
very
full
,
and
people
had
their
Birthday
clothes
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
with
the
Secretary
to
-
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
to
invite
five
,
but
I
only
invited
two
,
Lord
Anglesea
and
Lord
Carteret
.
 
<EOS>
Pshaw
,
I
told
you
this
but
yesterday
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
no
packets
from
Holland
yet
.
 
<EOS>
Here
are
a
parcel
of
drunken
Whiggish
lords
,
like
your
Lord
Santry
,
who
come
into
chocolate
-
houses
and
rail
aloud
at
the
Tories
,
and
have
challenges
sent
them
,
and
the
next
morning
come
and
beg
pardon
.
 
<EOS>
General
Ross
was
like
to
swinge
the
Marquis
of
Winchester
for
this
trick
t'other
day
;
and
we
have
nothing
else
now
to
talk
of
till
the
Parliament
has
had
another
bout
with
the
state
of
the
war
,
as
they
intended
in
a
few
days
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
ordered
the
Barrier
Treaty
to
be
laid
before
them
;
and
it
was
talked
some
time
ago
,
as
if
there
was
a
design
to
impeach
Lord
Townshend
,
who
made
it
.

I
have
no
more
politics
now

I
dined
with
Lord
Anglesea
to
-
day
,
who
had
seven
Irishmen
to
be
my
companions
,
of
which
two
only
were
coxcombs
;
one
I
did
not
know
,
and
t'other
was
young
Blith
,
who
is
a
puppy
of
figure
here
,
with
a
fine
chariot
.
 
<EOS>
He
asked
me
one
day
at
Court
,
when
I
had
been
just
talking
with
some
lords
who
stood
near
me
,
"
Doctor
,
when
shall
we
see
you
in
the
county
of
Meath
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
whispered
him
to
take
care
what
he
said
,
for
the
people
would
think
he
was
some
barbarian
.
 
<EOS>
He
never
would
speak
to
me
since
,
till
we
met
to
-
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
went
to
Lady
Masham
's
to
-
night
,
and
sat
with
Lord
Treasurer
and
the
Secretary
there
till
past
two
o'clock
;
and
when
I
came
home
,
found
some
letters
from
Ireland
,
which
I
read
,
but
can
say
nothing
of
them
till
to
-
morrow
,
'
tis
so
very
late

but
I
must
always
be

One
letter
was
from
the
Bishop
of
Clogher
last
night
,
and
t'other
from
Walls
,
about
Mrs.
South
's
salary
,
and
his
own
pension
of
18
pounds
for
his
tithe
of
the
park
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
do
nothing
in
either
;
the
first
I
can
not
serve
in
,
and
the
other
is
a
trifle
;
only
you
may
tell
him
I
had
his
letter
,
and
will
speak
to
Ned
Southwell
about
what
he
desires
me
.
 
<EOS>
You
say
nothing
of
your
Dean
's
receiving
my
letter
.
 
<EOS>
I
find
Clements
,
whom
I
recommended
to
Lord
Anglesea
last
year
,
at
Walls
's
desire
,
or
rather
the
Bishop
of
Clogher
's
,
is
mightily
in
Lord
Anglesea
's
favour
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
tell
the
Bishop
and
Walls
so
;
I
said
to
Lord
Anglesea
that
I
was
[
glad
]
<EOS>
I
had
the
good
luck
to
recommend
him
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
in
the
City
with
my
printer
,
to
consult
with
him
about
some
papers
Lord
Treasurer
gave
me
last
night
,
as
he
always
does
,
too
late
;
however
,
I
will
do
something
with
them
.

My
third
cold
is
a
little
better
;
I
never
had
anything
like
it
before
,
three
colds
successively
;
I
hope
I
shall
have
the
fourth
.
 
<EOS>
Those
messengers
come
from
Holland
to
-
day
,
and
they
brought
over
the
six
packets
that
were
due
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
not
the
particulars
yet
,
for
when
I
was
with
the
Secretary
at
noon
they
were
just
opening
;
but
one
thing
I
find
,
that
the
Dutch
are
playing
us
tricks
,
and
tampering
with
the
French
;
they
are
dogs
;
I
shall
know
more

about
some
observations

The
French
raise
difficulties
,
and
make
such
offers
to
the
Allies
as
can
not
be
accepted
.
 
<EOS>
And
the
Dutch
are
uneasy
that
we
are
likely
to
get
anything
for
ourselves
;
and
the
Whigs
are
glad
at
all
this
.
 
<EOS>
I
came
home
early
,
and
have
been
very
busy
three
or
four
hours
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
a
letter
from
Dr.
Pratt
to
-
day
by
a
private
hand
,
recommending
the
bearer
to
me
,
for
something
that
I
shall
not
trouble
myself
about
.
 
<EOS>
Wesley
writ
to
recommend
the
same
fellow
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
His
expression
is
that
,
hearing
I
am
acquainted
with
my
Lord
Treasurer
,
he
desires
I
would
do
so
and
so
:
 
a
matter
of
nothing
.
<EOS>
What
puppies
are
mankind
!
 
<EOS>
I
hope
I
shall
be
wiser
when
I
have
once
done
with
Courts
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
you
han't
troubled
me
much
with
your
recommendations
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
do
you
all
the
saavis
I
could
.
  
<EOS>
Pray
have
you
got
your
aplon
,
maram
Ppt

<EOS>
I
paid
for
it
but
<EOS>
yesterday
;
that
puts
me
in
mind
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
writ
an
inventory
of
what
things
I
sent
by
Leigh
in
one
of
my
letters
;
did
you
compare
it
with
what
you
got
?
 
<EOS>
I
hear
nothing
of
your

now

do
you
never

Our
Society
dined
to
-
day
at
Mr.
Secretary
's
house
.
 
<EOS>
I
went
there
at
four
;
but
hearing
the
House
of
Commons
would
sit
late
upon
the
Barrier
Treaty
<EOS>
,
I
went
for
an
hour
to
Kensington
,
to
see
Lord
Masham
's
children
.
 
<EOS>
My
young
nephew
,
his
son
of
six
months
old
,
has
got
a
swelling
in
his
neck
;
I
fear
it
is
the
evil
.
 
<EOS>
We
did
not
go
to
dinner
till
eight
at
night
,
and
I
left
them
at
ten
.
 
<EOS>
The
Commons
have
been
very
severe
on
the
Barrier
Treaty
,
as
you
will
find
by
their
votes
.
 
<EOS>
A
Whig
member
took
out
the
Conduct
of
the
Allies
,
and
read
that
passage
about
the
succession
with
great
resentment
;
but
none
seconded
him
.
 
<EOS>
The
Church
party
carried
every
vote
by
a
great
majority
.
 
<EOS>
The
A.B.
Dublin
is
so
railed
at
by
all
who
come
from
Ireland
that
I
can
defend
him
no
longer
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Anglesea
assured
me
that
the
story
of
applying
Piso
out
of
Tacitus
to
Lord
Treasurer
's
being
wounded
is
true
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
the
Duke
of
Beaufort
will
be
admitted
to
our
Society
next
meeting
.
 
<EOS>
To
-
day
I
published
the
Fable
of
Midas
,
a
poem
,
printed
in
a
loose
half
-
sheet
of
paper
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
not
how
it
will
sell
;
but
it
passed
wonderfully
at
our
Society
to
-
night
;
and
Mr.
Secretary
read
it
before
me
the
other
night
to
Lord
Treasurer
,
at
Lord
Masham
's
,
where
they
equally
approved
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
Tell
me
how
it
passes
with
you
.
<EOS>
I
think
this
paper
is
larger
than
ordinary
;
for
here
is
six
days
'
journal
,
and
no
nearer
the
bottom
.
 
<EOS>
I
fear
these
journals
are
very
dull
.

<EOS>
Mr.
Lewis
and
I
dined
by
invitation
with
a
Scotch
acquaintance
,
after
I
had
been
very
busy
in
my
chamber
till
two
afternoon
.
 
<EOS>
My
third
cold
is
now
very
troublesome
on
my
breast
,
especially
in
the
morning
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
a
great
revolution
in
my
health
;
colds
never
used
to
return
so
soon
with
me
,
or
last
so
long
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
very
surprising
this
news
to
-
day
of
the
Dauphin
and
Dauphiness
both
dying
within
six
days
.
 
<EOS>
They
say
the
old
King
is
almost
heart
-
broke
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
had
prodigious
mortifications
in
his
family
.
 
<EOS>
The
Dauphin
has
left
two
little
sons
,
of
four
and
two
years
old
;
the
eldest
is
sick
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
a
foolish
story
got
about
the
town
that
Lord
Strafford
,
one
of
our
Plenipotentiaries
,
is
in
the
interests
of
France
;
and
it
has
been
a
good
while
said
that
Lord
Privy
Seal
<EOS>
and
he
do
not
agree
very
well
.
 
<EOS>
They
are
both
long
practised
in
business
,
but
neither
of
them
of
much
parts
.
 
<EOS>
Strafford
has
some
life
and
spirit
,
but
is
infinitely
proud
,
and
wholly
illiterate
.

<EOS>
I
dined
to
-
day
in
the
City
with
my
printer
,
to
finish
something
I
am
doing
about
the
Barrier
Treaty
;
but
it
is
not
quite
done
.
 
<EOS>
I
went
this
evening
to
Lord
Masham
's
,
where
Lord
Treasurer
sat
with
us
till
past
twelve
.
<EOS>
The
Lords
have
voted
an
Address
to
the
Queen
,
to
tell
her
they
are
not
satisfied
with
the
King
of
France
's
offers
.
 
<EOS>
The
Whigs
brought
it
in
of
a
sudden
;
and
the
Court
could
not
prevent
it
,
and
therefore
did
not
oppose
it
.
<EOS>
The
House
of
Lords
is
too
strong
in
Whigs
,
notwithstanding
the
new
creations
;
for
they
are
very
diligent
,
and
the
Tories
as
lazy
:
 
the
side
that
is
down
has
always
most
industry
.
 
<EOS>
The
Whigs
intended
to
have
made
a
vote
that
would
reflect
on
Lord
Treasurer
;
but
their
project
was
not
ripe
.
 
<EOS>
I
hit
my
face
such
a
rap
by
calling
the
coach
to
stop
to
-
night
,
that
it
is
plaguy
sore
,
the
bone
beneath
the
eye

The
Court
was
mighty
full
to

day
,
and
has
been
these
many
Sundays
;
but
the
Queen
was
not
at
chapel
.
 
<EOS>
She
has
got
a
little
fit
of
the
gout
in
her
foot
.
 
<EOS>
The
good
of
going
to
Court
is
that
one
sees
all
one
's
acquaintance
,
whom
otherwise
I
should
hardly
meet
twice
a
year
.
 
<EOS>
Prince
Eugene
dines
with
the
Secretary
to
-
day
,
with
about
seven
or
eight
General
Officers
,
or
foreign
Ministers
.
 
<EOS>
They
will
be
all
drunk
,
I
am
sure
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
was
in
company
with
this
Prince
:
 
<EOS>
I
have
proposed
to
some
lords
that
we
should
have
a
sober
meal
with
him
;
but
I
ca
n't
compass
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
come
over
in
the
Dutch
news
prints
that
I
was
arrested
on
an
action
of
twenty
thousand
pounds
by
the
Duke
of
Marlborough
.
 
<EOS>
I
did
not
like
my
Court
invitation
to
-
day
;
so
Sir
Andrew
Fountaine
and
<EOS>
I
went
and
dined
with
Mrs.
Van
.
 
<EOS>
I
came
home
at
six
,
and
have
been
very
busy
till
this
minute

and
it

I
got
into

to
write

Pray
is
Dr.
Griffith
reconciled
to
me
yet

Have

Lewis
had
Guiscard
's
picture
:
 
he
bought
it
,
and
offered
it
to
Lord
Treasurer
,
who
promised
to
send
for
it
,
but
never
did
;
so
I
made
Lewis
give
it
me
,
and
I
have
it
in
my
room
;
and
now
Lord
Treasurer
says
he
will
take
it
from
me
:
 
is
that
fair
?
 
<EOS>
He
designs
to
have
it
at
length
in
the
clothes
he
was
when
he
did
the
action
,
and
a
penknife
in
his
hand
;
and
Kneller
is
to
copy
it
from
this
that
I
have
.
 
<EOS>
I
intended
to
dine
with
Lord
Treasurer
to

day
,
but
he
has
put
me
off
till
to

morrow
;
so
I
dined
with
Lord
Dupplin
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
Lord
Dupplin
very
well
;
he
is
a
brother
of
the
Society

<EOS>
Well

but
I
have
received
a
letter
from
the
Bishop
of
Cloyne
,
to
solicit
an
affair
for
him
with
Lord
Treasurer
,
and
with
the
Parliament
,
which
I
will
do
as
soon
as
fly

so
keen
about
other
people
's
affairs

I

you
have
been
in

about
the
report
of
my
being
arrested

<EOS>
The
pamphleteers
have
let
me
alone
this
month

which
is
a
great
wonder

only
the

of
the
Answer

I
dined
with
Lord
Treasurer
to

day
,
and
sat
with
him
till
ten
,
in
spite
of
my
teeth
,
though
my
printer
waited
for
me
to
correct
a
sheet
.
 
<EOS>
I
told
him
of
four
lines
I
writ
extempore
with
my
pencil
,
on
a
bit
of
paper
in
his
house
,
while
he
lay
wounded
.
 
<EOS>
Some
of
the
servants
,
I
suppose
,
made
waste
-
paper
of
them
,
and
he
never
had
heard
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
Shall
I
tell
them
you
?
 
<EOS>
They
were
inscribed
to
Mr.
Harley
's
physician
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
       
On
Britain
Europe
's
safety
lies
;
     
<EOS>
Britain
is
lost

if
Harley
dies

Harley
depends
upon
your
skill
:
     
<EOS>
Think
what
you
save
,
or
what
you
kill
.
  
<EOS>
Are
not
they
well
enough
to
be
done
off

hand
;
for
that
is
the
meaning
of
the
word
extempore
,
which
you
did
not
know
,
did
you
?
 
<EOS>
I
proposed
that
some
company
should
dine
with
him
on
the
8th
of
March
,
which
was
the
day
he
was
wounded
,
but
he
says
he
designs
that
the
Lords
of
the
Cabinet
,
who
then
sat
with
him
,
should
dine
that
day
with
him
:
 
<EOS>
however
,
he
has
invited
me
too

the
Secretary
coming
out
from
Sir

for
two
hours

in
vain
,
about

I
went
into

to
correct

sheets

the
Barrier
Treaty

Remarks

which
must

<EOS>
I
have
been
horrible
busy
for
some
days
past

with
this
and
some
other
things
;
and
I
wanted
some
very
necessary
papers
,
which
the
Secretary
was
to
give
me
,
and
the
pamphlet
must
now
be
published
without
them
.
<EOS>
But
they
are
all
busy
too

Sir

Ministry
about

will
be
mentioned

<EOS>
The
Secretary
,
I

<EOS>
It

<EOS>
I

sent

I
left
them
at
seven

being
engaged
to
go
to
Sir

who
desired
I
would
see

shall
succeed

because
it
is

I
have
taken
my
share

I
finished
the
rest
of
my

today
,
and
sent
it
to
him
about
one
o'clock
;
and
then
dined
privately
with
my
friend
Mr.
Lewis
,
to
talk
over
some
affairs
of
moment
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
gotten
the
thirteenth
volume
of
Rymer
's
Collection
of
the
Records
of
the
Tower
for
the
University
of
Dublin
.
 
<EOS>
I
have

now

<EOS>
I
will
write
to
the
Provost
,
to
know
how
I
shall
send
them
to
him

no

I
wo
n't

for
I
will
bring
them
myself
among
my
own
books

<EOS>
I
was
with
Hanmer
this
morning
,
and
there
were
the
Secretary
and
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
very
busy
with
him
,
laying
their
heads
together
about
the
representation

<EOS>
I
went
to
Lord
Masham

and
Lady
Masham
made
me
read
to
her
a
pretty
twopenny
pamphlet
,
called
The
St.
Albans
Ghost
.
 
<EOS>
I
thought
I
had
writ
it
myself
;
so
did
they
;
but
I
did
not
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Treasurer
came
down
to
us
from
the
Queen

and
we
stayed
till
two
o'clock

That
is
the

LETTER
42
.
 
<EOS>
LONDON
,
Feb.
23
,
1711
-
12
.
  
<EOS>
After
having
disposed
my
last
letter
in
the
post
-
office
,
I
am
now
to
begin
this
with
telling
MD
that
I
dined
with
the
Secretary
to
-
day
,
who
is
much
out
of
order
with
a
cold
,
and
feverish
;
yet
he
went
to
the
Cabinet
Council
tonight
at
six
,
against
my
will
.
 
<EOS>
The
Secretary
is
much
the
greatest
commoner
in
England
,
and
turns
the
whole
Parliament
,
who
can
do
nothing
without
him
;
and
if
he
lives
and
has
his
health
,
will
,
I
believe
,
be
one
day
at
the
head
of
affairs
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
told
him
sometimes
that
,
if
I
were
a
dozen
years
younger
,
I
would
cultivate
his
favour
,
and
trust
my
fortune
with
his
.
 
<EOS>
But
what
care
oo
for
all
this
?
 
<EOS>
I
am
sorry
when
I
came
first
acquainted
with
this
Ministry
that
I
did
not
send
you
their
names
and
characters
,
and
then
you
would
have
relished
what
I
would
have
writ
,
especially
if
I
had
let
you
into
the
particulars
of
affairs
:
 
but
enough
of
this
.
 
<EOS>
Nite
,
deelest
logues
.
  
<EOS>
24
.
 
<EOS>
I
went
early
this
morning
to
the
Secretary
,
who
is
not
yet
well
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
Thomas
Hanmer
and
the
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
came
while
I
was
there
,
and
he
would
not
let
me
stir
;
so
I
did
not
go
to
church
,
but
was
busy
with
them
till
noon
,
about
the
affair
I
told
you
in
my
last
.
 
<EOS>
The
other
two
went
away
;
and
I
dined
with
the
Secretary
,
and
found
my
head
very
much
out
of
order
,
but
no
absolute
fit
;
and
I
have
not
been
well
all
this
day
.
 
<EOS>
It
has
shook
me
a
little
.
 
<EOS>
I
sometimes
sit
up
very
late
at
Lord
Masham
's
,
and
have
writ
much
for
several
days
past
:
 
<EOS>
but
I
will
amend
both
;
for
I
have
now
very
little
business
,
and
hope
I
shall
have
no
more
,
and
I
am
resolved
to
be
a
great
rider
this
summer
in
Ireland
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
to
see
Mrs.
Wesley
this
evening
,
who
has
been
somewhat
better
for
this
month
past
,
and
talks
of
returning
to
the
Bath
in
a
few
weeks
.
 
<EOS>
Our
peace
goes
on
but
slowly
;
the
Dutch
are
playing
tricks
,
and
we
do
not
push
it
strongly
as
we
ought
.
 
<EOS>
The
fault
of
our
Court
is
delay
,
of
which
the
Queen
has
a
great
deal
;
and
Lord
Treasurer
is
not
without
his
share
.
<EOS>
But
pay
richar
MD
<EOS>
ret
<EOS>
us
know
a
little
of
your
life
and
tonvelsasens
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
play
at
ombre
,
or
visit
the
Dean
,
and
Goody
Walls
and
Stoytes
and
Manleys
,
as
usual
?
 
<EOS>
I
must
have
a
letter
from
oo
,
to
fill
the
other
side
of
this
sheet
.
<EOS>
Let
me
know
what
you
do
.
 
<EOS>
Is
my
aunt
alive
yet
?
  
<EOS>
Oh
,
pray
,
now
I
think
of
it
,
be
so
kind
to
step
to
my
aunt
,
and
take
notice
of
my
great
-
grandfather
's
picture
;
you
know
he
has
a
ring
on
his
finger
,
with
a
seal
of
an
anchor
and
dolphin
about
it
;
but
I
think
there
is
besides
,
at
the
bottom
of
the
picture
,
the
same
coat
of
arms
quartered
with
another
,
which
I
suppose
was
my
great
-
grandmother
's
.
 
<EOS>
If
this
be
so
,
it
is
a
stronger
argument
than
the
seal
.
 
<EOS>
And
pray
see
whether
you
think
that
coat
of
arms
was
drawn
at
the
same
time
with
the
picture
,
or
whether
it
be
of
a
later
hand
;
and
ask
my
aunt
what
she
knows
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
But
perhaps
there
is
no
such
coat
of
arms
on
the
picture
,
and
I
only
dreamed
it
.
 
<EOS>
My
reason
is
,
because
I
would
ask
some
herald
here
,
whether
I
should
choose
that
coat
,
or
one
in
Guillim
's
large
folio
of
heraldry
,
where
my
uncle
Godwin
is
named
with
another
coat
of
arms
of
three
stags
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
sad
stuff
to
rite
;
so
nite
,
MD
.
  
<EOS>
25
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
this
morning
again
with
the
Secretary
,
and
we
were
two
hours
busy
;
and
then
went
together
to
the
Park
,
Hyde
Park
,
I
mean
;
and
he
walked
to
cure
his
cold
,
and
we
were
looking
at
two
Arabian
horses
sent
some
time
ago
to
Lord
Treasurer
.
 
<EOS>
The
Duke
of
Marlborough
's
coach
overtook
us
,
with
his
Grace
and
Lord
Godolphin
in
it
;
but
they
did
not
see
us
,
to
our
great
satisfaction
;
for
neither
of
us
desired
that
either
of
those
two
lords
should
see
us
together
.
<EOS>
There
was
half
a
dozen
ladies
riding
like
cavaliers
to
take
the
air
.
 
<EOS>
My
head
is
better
to
-
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
with
the
Secretary
;
but
we
did
no
business
after
dinner
,
and
at
six
I
walked
into
the
fields
;
the
days
are
grown
pure
and
long
;
then
I
went
to
visit
Perceval
and
his
family
,
whom
I
had
seen
but
twice
since
they
came
to
town
.
 
<EOS>
They
too
are
going
to
the
Bath
next
month
.
 
<EOS>
Countess
Doll
of
Meath
is
such
an
owl
that
,
wherever
I
visit
,
people
are
asking
me
whether
I
know
such
an
Irish
lady
,
and
her
figure
and
her
foppery
?
 
<EOS>
I
came
home
early
,
and
have
been
amusing
myself
with
looking
into
one
of
Rymer
's
volumes
of
the
Records
of
the
Tower
,
and
am
mighty
easy
to
think
I
have
no
urgent
business
upon
my
hands
.
 
<EOS>
My
third
cold
is
not
yet
off
;
I
sometimes
cough
,
and
am
not
right
with
it
in
the
morning
.
 
<EOS>
Did
I
tell
you
that
I
believe
it
is
Lady
Masham
's
hot
room
that
gives
it
me
?
 
<EOS>
I
never
knew
such
a
stove
;
and
in
my
conscience
I
believe
both
my
lord
and
she
,
my
Lord
Treasurer
,
Mr.
Secretary
,
and
myself
have
all
suffered
by
it
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
all
had
colds
together
,
but
I
walk
home
on
foot
.
 
<EOS>
Nite
dee
logues
.
  
<EOS>
26
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
again
busy
with
the
Secretary
.
 
<EOS>
We
read
over
some
papers
,
and
did
a
good
deal
of
business
;
and
I
dined
with
him
,
and
we
were
to
do
more
business
after
dinner
;
but
after
dinner
is
after
dinner
 
an
old
saying
and
a
true
,
"
much
drinking
,
little
thinking
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
We
had
company
with
us
,
and
nothing
could
be
done
,
and
I
am
to
go
there
again
to
-
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
now
nothing
to
do
;
and
the
Parliament
,
by
the
Queen
's
recommendation
,
is
to
take
some
method
for
preventing
libels
,
etc
.
,
which
will
include
pamphlets
,
I
suppose
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
what
method
they
will
take
,
but
it
comes
on
in
a
day
or
two
.
 
<EOS>
To
-
day
in
the
morning
I
visited
upwards
:
 
<EOS>
first
I
saw
the
Duke
of
Ormond
below
stairs
,
and
gave
him
joy
of
his
being
declared
General
in
Flanders
;
then
I
went
up
one
pair
of
stairs
,
and
sat
with
the
Duchess
;
then
I
went
up
another
pair
of
stairs
,
and
paid
a
visit
to
Lady
Betty
;
and
desired
her
woman
to
go
up
to
the
garret
,
that
I
might
pass
half
an
hour
with
her
,
but
she
was
young
and
handsome
,
and
would
not
.
 
<EOS>
The
Duke
is
our
President
this
week
,
and
I
have
bespoke
a
small
dinner
on
purpose
,
for
good
example
.
 
<EOS>
Nite

deelest
logues

<EOS>
27
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
again
with
the
Secretary
this
morning
;
but
we
only
read
over
some
papers
with
Sir
Thomas
Hanmer
;
then
I
called
at
Lord
Treasurer
's
;
it
was
his
levee
-
day
,
but
I
went
up
to
his
bed
-
chamber
,
and
said
what
I
had
to
say
.
 
<EOS>
I
came
down
and
peeped
in
at
the
chamber
,
where
a
hundred
fools
were
waiting
,
and
two
streets
were
full
of
coaches
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
in
the
City
with
my
printer
,
and
came
back
at
six
to
Lord
Treasurer
,
who
had
invited
me
to
dinner
,
but
I
refused
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
sat
there
an
hour
or
two
,
and
then
went
to
Lord
Masham
's
.
<EOS>
They
were
all
abroad
:
 
so
truly
I
came
,
and
read
whatever
stuff
was
next
me
.
<EOS>
I
can
sit
and
be
idle
now
,
which
I
have
not
been
above
a
year
past
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
I
will
stay
out
the
session
,
to
see
if
they
have
any
further
commands
for
me
,
and
that
,
I
suppose
,
will
end
in
April
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
may
go
somewhat
before
,
for
I
hope
all
will
be
ended
by
then
,
and
we
shall
have
either
a
certain
peace
,
or
certain
war
.
 
<EOS>
The
Ministry
is
contriving
new
funds
for
money
by
lotteries
,
and
we
go
on
as
if
the
war
were
to
continue
,
but
I
believe
it
will
not
.
 
<EOS>

<EOS>
I
have
been
packing
up
some
books
in
a
great
box
I
have
bought
,
and
must
buy
another
for
clothes
and
luggage
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
a
beginning
towards
a
removal
.
<EOS>
I
have
sent
to
Holland
for
a
dozen
shirts
,
and
design
to
buy
another
new
gown
and
hat
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
come
over
like
a
zinkerman
,
and
lay
out
nothing
in
clothes
in
Ireland
this
good
while
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
writ
this
night
to
the
Provost
.
<EOS>
Our
Society
met
to
-
day
as
usual
,
and
we
were
fourteen
,
beside
the
Earl
of
Arran
,
whom
his
brother
,
the
Duke
of
Ormond
,
brought
among
us
against
all
order
.
 
<EOS>
We
were
mightily
shocked
;
but
,
after
some
whispers
,
it
ended
in
choosing
Lord
Arran
one
of
our
Society
,
which
I
opposed
to
his
face
,
but
it
was
carried
by
all
the
rest
against
me
.

<EOS>
Prince
George
was
born
on
this
day

<EOS>
People
are
mistaken
;
and
some
here
think
it
is
St.
David
's
Day
;
but
they
do
not
understand
the
virtue
of
leap
year
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
nothing
to
do
now
,
boys
,
and
have
been
reading
all
this
day
like
Gumdragon
;
<EOS>
and
yet
I
was
dictating
some
trifles
this
morning
to
a
printer
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
with
a
friend
hard
by
,
and
the
weather
was
so
discouraging
I
could
not
walk
.
 
<EOS>
I
came
home
early
,
and
have
read
two
hundred
pages
of
Arran
.
 
<EOS>
Alexander
the
Great
is
just
dead

<EOS>
I
do
not
think
he
was
poisoned
;
betwixt
you
and
me
,
all
those
are
but
<EOS>
idle
stories
:
 
<EOS>
it
is
certain
that
neither
Ptolemy
nor
Aristobulus
thought
so
,
and
they
were
both
with
him
when
he
died
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
a
pity
we
have
not
their
histories
.
 
<EOS>
The
Bill
for
limiting
Members
of
Parliament
to
have
<EOS>
but
so
many
places
passed
the
House
of
Commons
,
and
will
pass
the
House
of
Lords
,
in
spite
of
the
Ministry
,
which
you
know
is
a
great
lessening
of
the
Queen
's
power
.
 
<EOS>
Four
of
the
new
lords
voted
against
the
Court
in
this
point
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
certainly
a
good
Bill
in
the
reign
of
an
ill
prince
,
but
I
think
things
are
not
settled
enough
for
it
at
present
.

And
the

may
want
a
majority
upon
a

I
went
into
the
City
to
inquire
after
poor
Stratford
,
who
has
put
himself
a
prisoner
into
the
Queen
's
Bench
,
for
which
his
friends
blame
him
much
,
because
his
creditors
designed
to
be
very
easy
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
grasped
at
too
many
things
together
,
and
that
was
his
ruin
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
one
circumstance
relative
to
Lieutenant
-
General
Meredith
that
is
very
melancholy
:
 
<EOS>
Meredith
was
turned
out
of
all
his
employments
last
year
,
and
had
about
10,000
pounds
left
to
live
on
.
 
<EOS>
Stratford
,
upon
friendship
,
desired
he
might
have
the
management
of
it
for
Meredith
,
to
put
it
into
the
stocks
and
funds
for
the
best
advantage
,
and
now
he
has
lost
it
all
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
heard
me
often
talk
of
Stratford
;
we
were
class
-
fellows
at
school
and
university
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
with
some
merchants
,
his
friends
,
to
-
day
,
and
they
said
they
expected
his
breaking
this
good
while
.
 
<EOS>
I
gave
him
notice
of
a
treaty
of
peace
,
while
it
was
a
secret
,
of
which
he
might
have
made
good
use
,
but
that
helped
to
ruin
him
;
for
he
gave
money
,
reckoning
there
would
be
actually
a
peace
by
this
time
,
and
consequently
stocks
rise
high
.
 
<EOS>
Ford
narrowly
"
scaped
losing
500
pounds
by
him

and
so
did
I
too

Morning
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
wakened
at
three
this
morning
,
my
man
and
the
people
of
the
house
telling
me
of
a
great
fire
in
the
Haymarket
.
 
<EOS>
I
slept
again
,
and
two
hours
after
my
man
came
in
again
,
and
told
me
it
was
my
poor
brother
Sir
William
Wyndham
's
house
burnt
,
and
that
two
maids
,
leaping
out
of
an
upper
room
to
avoid
the
fire
,
both
fell
on
their
heads
,
one
of
them
upon
the
iron
spikes
before
the
door
,
and
both
lay
dead
in
the
streets
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
supposed
to
have
been
some
carelessness
of
one
or
both
those
maids
.
 
<EOS>
The
Duke
of
Ormond
was
there
helping
to
put
out
the
fire
.
 
<EOS>
Brother
Wyndham
gave
6,000
pounds
but
a
few
months
ago
for
that
house
,
as
he
told
me
,
and
it
was
very
richly
furnished
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
know
more
particulars
at
night
.
 
<EOS>
He
married
Lady
Catherine
Seymour
,
the
Duke
of
Somerset
's
daughter
;
<EOS>
you
know
her
,
I
believe
.
 
<EOS>
At
night
.
<EOS>
Wyndham
's
young
child
escaped
very
narrowly
;
Lady
Catherine
escaped
barefoot
;
they
all
went
to
Northumberland
House
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Brydges
's
house
,
at
next
door
,
is
damaged
much
,
and
was
like
to
be
burnt
.
 
<EOS>
Wyndham
has
lost
above
10,000
pounds
by
this
accident
;
his
lady
above
a
thousand
pounds
worth
of
clothes
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
terrible
accident
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
not
at
Court
to
-
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
with
Lord
Masham
.
 
<EOS>
The
Queen
was
not

church
.
 
<EOS>

<EOS>
Pray
tell
Walls
that
I
spoke
to
the
Duke
of
Ormond
and
Mr.
Southwell
about
his
friend
's
affair
,
who
,
I
find
,
needed
not
me
for
a
solicitor
,
for
they
both
told
me
the
thing
would
be
done
.
 
<EOS>
I
likewise
mentioned
his
own
affair
to
Mr.
Southwell
,
and
I
hope
that
will
be
done
too
,
for
Southwell
seems
to
think
it
reasonable
,
and
I
will
mind
him
of
it
again
.
 
<EOS>
Tell
him
this
nakedly
.
 
<EOS>
You
need
not
know
the
particulars
.
 
<EOS>
They
are
secrets
:
 
<EOS>
one
of
them
is
about
Mrs.
South
having
a
pension
;
the
other
about
his
salary
from
the
Government
for
the
tithes
of
the
park
that
lie
in
his
parish
,
to
be
put
upon
the
establishment
,
but
oo

<EOS>
zees

and
we

<EOS>
I
dined
in
the
City
with
my
printer
,
with
whom
I
had
some
small
affair
;
but
I
have
no
large
work
on
my
hands
now

<EOS>
I
was
with
Lord
Treasurer
this
morning
,
and
hat

Oo
dined
with

Monday

<EOS>
I
sat
to
-
day
with
poor
Mrs.
Wesley
,
who
made
me
dine
with
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
is
much
better
than
she
was
.
 
<EOS>
I
heartily
pray
for
her
health
,
out
of
the
entire
love
I
bear
to
her
worthy
husband
.
 
<EOS>
This
day
has
passed
very
insignificantly
.
<EOS>
But
it
is
a
great
comfort
to
me
now
that
I
can
come
home
and
read
,
and
have
nothing
upon
my
hands
to
write
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
at
Lord
Masham
's
to
-
night
,
and
stayed
there
till
one
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Treasurer
was
there
;
but
I
thought
,
I
thought
he
looked
melancholy
,
just
as
he
did
at
the
beginning
of
the
session
,
and
he
was
not
so
merry
as
usual
.
 
<EOS>
In
short
,
the
majority
in
the
House
of
Lords
is
a
very
weak
one
:
 
and
he
has
much
ado
to
keep
it
up
;
and
he
is
not
able
to
make
those
removes
he
would
,
and
oblige
his
friends
;
and
I
doubt
too
he
does
not
take
care
enough
about
it
,
or
rather
can
not
do
all
himself
,
and
will
not
employ
others
:
 
which
is
his
great
fault
,
as
I
have
often
told
you
.

Tis

<EOS>
I
wish
you
a
merry
Lent
.
 
<EOS>
I
hate
Lent
;
I
hate
different
diets
,
and
furmity
and
butter
,
and
herb
porridge
;
and
sour
devout
faces
of
people
who
only
put
on
religion
for
seven
weeks

<EOS>
I
was
at
the
Secretary
's
office
this
morning
;
and
there
a
gentleman
brought
me
two
letters
,
dated
last
October
;
one
from
the
Bishop
of
Clogher
,
t'other
from
Walls
.
 
<EOS>
The
gentleman
is
called
Colonel
Newburgh
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
you
mentioned
him
to
me
some
time
ago
;
he
has
business
in
the
House
of
Lords
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
do
him
what
service
I
can
.
 
<EOS>
The
Representation
of
the
House
of
Commons
is
printed

<EOS>
I
have
not
seen
it
yet
;
it
is
plaguy
severe
,
they
say
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
with
Dr.
Arbuthnot
,
and
had
a
true
Lenten
dinner
,
not
in
point
of
victuals
,
but
spleen
;
for
his
wife
and
a
child
or
two
were
sick
in
the
house
,
and
that
was
full
as
mortifying
as
fish
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
had
fine
mighty
cold
frosty
weather
for
some
days
past
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
you
take
the
advantage
of
it
,
and
walk
now
and
then
.
 
<EOS>
You
never
answer
that
part
of
my
letters
where
I
desire
you
to
walk
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
keep
my
breath
to
cool
my
Lenten
porridge

Tell
Jemmy
Leigh
that
his
boy
that
robbed
him
now
appears
about
the
town
:
 
<EOS>
Patrick
has
seen
him
once
or
twice
.
 
<EOS>
I
knew
nothing
of
his
being
robbed
till
Patrick
told
me
he
had
seen
the
boy
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
it
had
been
Sterne
that
had
been
robbed
,
to
be
revenged

lost

I
hear
Mr.
Prior
has
suffered
by
Stratford
's
breaking
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
yesterday
to
see
Prior
,
who
is
not
well
,
and
I
thought
he
looked
melancholy
.
 
<EOS>
He
can
ill
afford
to
lose
money
.
 
<EOS>
I
walked
before
dinner
in
the
Mall
a
good
while
with
Lord
Arran
and
Lord
Dupplin
,
two
of
my
brothers
,
and
then
we
went
to
dinner
,
where
the
Duke
of
Beaufort
was
our
President
.
 
<EOS>
We
were
but
eleven
to
-
day
.
 
<EOS>
We
are
now
in
all
nine
lords
and
ten
commoners
.
 
<EOS>
The
Duke
of
Beaufort
had
the
confidence
to
propose
his
brother
-
in
-
law
,
the
Earl
of
Danby
,
to
be
a
member
;
but
I
opposed
it
so
warmly
that
it
was
waived
.
 
<EOS>
Danby
is
not
above
twenty
,
and
we
will
have
no
more
boys
,
and
we
want
but
two
to
make
up
our
number
.
 
<EOS>
I
stayed
till
eight
,
and
then
we
all
went
away
soberly
.
 
<EOS>
The
Duke
of
Ormond
's
treat
last
week
cost
20
pounds
,
though
it
was
only
four
dishes
and
four
,
without
a
dessert
;
and
I
bespoke
it
in
order
to
be
cheap
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
I
could
not
prevail
to
change
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Treasurer
is
in
a
rage
with
us
for
being
so
extravagant
:
 
and
the
wine
was
not
reckoned
neither
;
for
that
is
always
brought
by
him
that
is
President
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Orrery
is
to
be
President
next
week
;
and
I
will
see
whether
it
can
not
be
cheaper
;
or
else
we
will
leave
the
house
.
.
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Masham
made
me
go
home
with
him
to
-
night
to
eat
boiled
oysters
.
 
<EOS>
Take
oysters
,
wash
them
clean
;
that
is
,
wash
their
shells
clean
;
then
put
your
oysters
into
an
earthen
pot
,
with
their
hollow
sides
down
,
then
put
this
pot
into
a
great
kettle
with
water
,
and
so
let
them
boil
.
<EOS>
Your
oysters
are
boiled
in
their
own
liquor
,
and
not
mixed
water
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Treasurer
was
not
with
us
;
he
was
very
ill
to
-
day
with
a
swimming
in
the
head
,
and
is
gone
home
to
be
cupped

sent
to
desire

to
excuse
him
to
the
Queen

I
was
to

at
the
House
of
Lords
about
a
friend

Bill
.
 
<EOS>
Then
I
crossed
the
water
at
Westminster
Stairs
to
Southwark
,
went
through
St.
George
's
Fields
to
the
Mint
,
which
is
the
dominion
of
the
King
's
Bench
Prison
,
where
Stratford
lodges
in
a
blind
alley
,
and
writ
to
me
to
come
to
him
;
but
he
was
gone
to
the
"
Change
.
 
<EOS>
I
thought
he
had
something
to
say
to
me
about
his
own
affairs
.
 
<EOS>
I
found
him
at
his
usual
coffee
-
house
,
and
went
to
his
own
lodgings
,
and
dined
with
him
and
his
wife
,
and
other
company
.
 
<EOS>
His
business
was
only
to
desire
I
would
intercede
with
the
Ministry
about
his
brother
-
in
-
law
,
Ben
Burton
,
of
Dublin
,
the
banker
,
who
is
likely
to
come
into
trouble
,
as
we
hear
,
about
spreading
false
Whiggish
news
.
 
<EOS>
I
hate
Burton
,
and
told
Stratford
so
;
and
I
will
advise
the
Duke
of
Ormond
to
make
use
of
it
,
to
keep
the
rogue
in
awe
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Stratford
tells
me
her
husband
's
creditors
have
consented
to
give
him
liberty
to
get
up
his
debts
abroad
;
and
she
hopes
he
will
pay
them
all

LETTER

<EOS>
LONDON
,
March
8
,
1711
-

.
  
<EOS>
I
carried
my
forty
-
second
letter
in
my
pocket
till
evening
,
and
then
put
it
in
the
general
post
.
 
<EOS>
I
went
in
the
morning
to
see
Lord
Treasurer
,
who
had
taken
physic
,
and
was
drinking
his
broth
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
been
with
the
Secretary
before
,
to
recommend
a
friend
,
one
Dr.
Freind
,
to
be
Physician
-
General
;
and
the
Secretary
promised
to
mention
it
to
the
Queen
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
serve
everybody
but
myself
.
 
<EOS>
Then
I
went
to
Court
,
and
carried
Lord
Keeper
and
the
Secretary
to
dine
with
Lord
Masham
,
when
we
drank
the
Queen
and
Lord
Treasurer
with
every
health
,
because
this
was
the
day
of
his
stabbing
.
 
<EOS>
Then
I
went
and
played
pools
at
picquet
with
Lady
Masham
and
Mrs.
Hill
;
won
ten
shillings
,
gave
a
crown
to
the
box
,
and
came
home
.
 
<EOS>
I
met
at
my
lodgings
a
letter
from
Joe
,
with
a
bit
annexed
from
Ppt
.
 
<EOS>
What
Joe
asks
is
entirely
out
of
my
way
,
and
I
take
it
for
a
foolish
whim
in
him
.
 
<EOS>
Besides
,
I
know
not
who
is
to
give
a
patent
:
if
the
Duke
of
Ormond
,
I
would
speak
to
him
;
and
if
it
come
in
my
head
I
will
mention
it
to
Ned
Southwell
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
no
patents
that
I
know
of
for
such
things
here
,
but
good
security
is
all
;
and
to
think
that
I
would
speak
to
Lord
Treasurer
for
any
such
matter
at
random
is
a
jest
.
 
<EOS>
Did
I
tell
you
of
a
race
of
rakes
,
called
the
Mohocks
,
that
play
the
devil
about
this
town
every
night
,
slit
people
's
noses
,
and
beat
them

I
did
not
care
to
dine
with
;
so
I
dined
with
Mrs.
Van
.
 
<EOS>
Young
Davenant
was
telling
us
at
Court
how
he
was
set
upon
by
the
Mohocks
,
and
how
they
ran
his
chair
through
with
a
sword
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
not
safe
being
in
the
streets
at
night
for
them
.

The
Bishop
of
Salisbury
's
son
is
said
to
be
of
the
gang
.
 
<EOS>
They
are
all
Whigs
;
and
a
great
lady
sent
to
me
,
to
speak
to
her
father
and
to
Lord
Treasurer
,
to
have
a
care
of
them
,
and
to
be
careful
likewise
of
myself
;
for
she
heard
they
had
malicious
intentions
against
the
Ministers
and
their
friends
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
not
whether
there
be
anything
in
this
,
though
others
are
of
the
same
opinion
.
 
<EOS>
The
weather
still
continues
very
fine
and
frosty
.
 
<EOS>
I
walked
in
the
Park
this
evening
,
and
came
home
early
to
avoid
the
Mohocks
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Treasurer
is
better

<EOS>
I
went
this
morning
again
to
the
Lord
Treasurer
,
who
is
quite
recovered
;
and
I
stayed
till
he
went
out
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
with
a
friend
in
the
City
,
about
a
little
business
of
printing
;
but
not
my
own
.
 
<EOS>
You
must
buy
a
small
twopenny
pamphlet
,
called
Law
is
a
Bottomless
Pit
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
very
prettily
written
,
and
there
will
be
a
Second
Part
.
 
<EOS>
The
Commons
are
very
slow
in
bringing
in
their
Bill
to
limit
the
press
,
and
the
pamphleteers
make
good
use
of
their
time
;
for
there
come
out
three
or
four
every
day
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
but
is
not
it
time
,
methinks
,
to
have
a
letter
from
MD
?
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
now
six
weeks
since
I
had
your
Number

.
 
<EOS>
I
can
assure
oo
<EOS>
I
expect
one
before
this
goes
;
and
I
'll
make
shorter
day

journals
than
usual
,

cause
I
hope
to
fill
up
a
good
deal
of

Lord

has
lent
the
long
letter
I
writ
him
to
Prior
,
and
I
ca
n't
get
Prior
to
return
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
want
to
have
it
printed
,
and
to
make
up
this
Academy
for
the
improvement
of
our

we

I
dined
privately
with
my
friend
Lewis
,
and
then
went
to
see
Ned
Southwell
,
and
talk
with
him
about
Walls
's
business
,
and
<EOS>
Mrs.
South
's
.
 
<EOS>
The
latter
will
be
done
;
but
his
own
not
.
 
<EOS>
Southwell
tells
me
that
it
must
be
laid
before
Lord
Treasurer
,
and
the
nature
of
it
explained
,
and
a
great
deal
of
clutter
,
which
is
not
worth
the
while
;
and
maybe
Lord
Treasurer
wo
n't
do
it
[
at
]
last
;
and
it
is
,
as
Walls
says
himself
,
not
above
forty
shillings
a
year
difference
.
 
<EOS>
You
must
tell
Walls
this
,
unless
he
would
have
the
business
a
secret
from
you
:
 
in
that
case
<EOS>
only
say
I
did
all
I
could
with
Ned
Southwell
,
and
it
ca
n't
be
done
;
for
it
must
be
laid
before
Lord
Treasurer
,
etc
.
,
who
will
not
do
it
;
and
besides
,
it
is
not
worth
troubling
his
lordship
.

<EOS>
Grub

papers
about
them
fly
like
lightning
,
and
a
list
printed
of
near
eighty
put
into
several
prisons
,
and
all
a
lie
;
and
I
begin
almost
to
think
there
is
no
truth
,
or
very
little
,
in
the
whole
story
.
 
<EOS>
He
that
abused
Davenant
was
a
drunken
gentleman
;
none
of
that
gang
.
 
<EOS>
My
man
tells
me
that
one
of
the
lodgers
heard
in
a
coffee
-
house
,
publicly
,
that
one
design
of
the
Mohocks
was
upon
me
,
if
they
could
catch
me
;
and
though
I
believe
nothing
of
it
,
I
forbear
walking
late
,
and
they
have
put
me
to
the
charge
of
some
shillings
already
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
to
-
day
with
Lord
Treasurer
and
two
gentlemen
of
the
Highlands
of
Scotland
,
yet
<EOS>
very
polite
men
.
 
<EOS>
I
sat
there
till
nine
,
and
then
went
to
Lord
Masham
's
,
where
Lord
Treasurer
followed
me
,
and
we
sat
till
twelve
;
and
I
came
home
in
a
chair
for
fear
of
the
Mohocks
,
and
I
have
given
him
warning
of
it
too
.
 
<EOS>
Little
Harrison
,
whom
I
sent
to
Holland
,
is
now
actually
made
Queen

Secretary
at
The
Hague

<EOS>
It
will
be
in

<EOS>
Here
is
a
young
fellow
has
writ
some
Sea
Eclogues
,
poems
of
Mermen
,
resembling
pastorals
of
shepherds
,
and
they
are
very
pretty
,
and
the
thought
is
new
.
 
<EOS>
Mermen
are
he

mermaids
;
Tritons
,
natives
of
the
sea
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
understand
me
?
 
<EOS>
I
think
to
recommend
him
to
our
Society
to
-
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
His
name
is
Diaper

P

on
him
,
I
must
do
something
for
him
,
and
get
him
out
of
the
way
.
 
<EOS>
I
hate
to
have
any
new
wits
rise
,
but
when
they
do
rise
I
would
encourage
them
;
but
they
tread
on
our
heels
and
thrust
us
off
the
stage

You
would
laugh
to
see
our
printer
constantly
attending
our
Society
after
dinner
,
and
bringing
us
whatever
new
thing
he
has
printed
,
which
he
seldom
fails
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
he
had
nothing
to

day

<EOS>
Lord
Lansdowne
,
one
of
our
Society
,
was
offended
at
a
passage
in
this
day
's
Examiner
,
which
he
thinks
reflects
on
him
,
as
I
believe
it
does
,
though
in
a
mighty
civil
way
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
only
that
his
underlings
cheat

but
that
he
is
a
very
fine
gentleman

way

<EOS>
Lord
Orrery
was
President

were
absent

<EOS>
Brother
Wyndham
recommended
Diaper
to
the

<EOS>
I
believe
we
shall
make
a
contribution
among
ourselves
,
which
I
do
n't
like

<EOS>
Lord
Treasurer
has
yet
done
nothing
for
us
,
but
we
shall
try
him
soon

<EOS>
The
company
parted
early
,
but
Freind
,
and
Prior
,
and
I
,
sat
a
while
longer
and
reformed
the
State
,
and
found
fault
with
the
Ministry
.
 
<EOS>
Prior
hates
his
Commission
of
the
Customs
,
because
it
spoils
his
wit
.
 
<EOS>
He
says
he
dreams
of
nothing

and

I
have
been
plagued
this
morning
with
solicitors
,
and
with
nobody
more
than
my
brother
,
Dr.
Freind
,
who
must
needs
have
to
get
<EOS>
old
Dr.
Lawrence
,
the
Physician
-
General
,
turned
out
and
himself
in
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
argued
with
me
so
long
upon
the
reasonableness
of
it
,
that
I
am
fully
convinced
it
is
very
unreasonable
;
and
so
I
would
tell
the
Secretary
,
if
I
had
not
already
made
him
speak
to
the
Queen
.
 
<EOS>
Besides
,
I
know
not
but
my
friend
Dr.
Arbuthnot
would
be
content
to
have
it
himself
,
and
I
love
him
ten
times
better
than
Freind
.
<EOS>
What
's
all
this
to
you
?
<EOS>
but
I
must
talk
of
things
as
they
happen
in
the
day
,
whether
you
know
anything
of
them
or
no
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
in
the
City
,
and
,
coming
back
,
one
Parson
Richardson
of
Ireland
overtook
me
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
here
last
summer
upon
a
project
of
converting
the
Irish
and
printing
Bibles
,
etc
.
,
in
that
language
,
and
is
now
returned
to
pursue
it
on
.
 
<EOS>
He
tells
me
Dr.
Coghill
came
last
night
[
to
]
town
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
send
to
see
how
he
does
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
He
gave
me
a
letter
from
Walls
about
his
old
business
.

<EOS>
I
had
intended
to
be
early
with
the
Secretary
this
morning
,
when
my
man
admitted
upstairs
one
Mr.
Newcomb
,
an
officer
,
who
brought
me
a
letter
from
the
Bishop
of
Clogher
,
with
four
lines
added
by
Mrs.
Ashe
,
all
about
that
Newcomb
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
,
indeed
,
his
case
is
hard
,
but
God
knows
whether
I
shall
be
able
to
do
him
any
service
.
 
<EOS>
People
will
not
understand
:
 
I
am
a
very
good
second
,
but
I
care
not
to
begin
a
recommendation
,
unless
it
be
for
an
intimate
friend
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
I
will
do
what
I
can
.
 
<EOS>
I
missed
the
Secretary
,
and
then
walked
to
Chelsea
to
dine
with
the
Dean
of
Christ
Church
,
who
was
engaged
to
Lord
Orrery
with
some
other
Christ
Church
men
.
 
<EOS>
He
made
me
go
with
him
whether
I
would
or
not
,
for
they
have
this
long
time
admitted
me
a
Christ
Church
man
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Orrery
,
generally
every
winter
,
gives
his
old
acquaintance
of
that
college
a
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
nine
clergymen
at
table
,
and
four
laymen
.
 
<EOS>
The
Dean
<EOS>
and
I
soon
left
them
,
and
after
a
visit
or
two
,
I
went
to
Lord
Masham
's
,
and
Lord
Treasurer
,
Arbuthnot
<EOS>
and
I
sat
till
twelve
.
 
<EOS>
And
now
I
am
come
home
and
got
to
bed
.
 
<EOS>
I
came
afoot
,
but
had
my
man
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Treasurer
advised
me
not
to
go
in
a
chair
,
because
the
Mohocks
insult
chairs
more
than
they
do
those
on
foot
.
 
<EOS>
They
think
there
is
some
mischievous
design
in
those
villains
.
 
<EOS>
Several
of
them
,
Lord
Treasurer
told
me
,
are
actually
taken
up
.
 
<EOS>
I
heard
at
dinner
that
one
of
them
was
killed
last
night
.
 
<EOS>
We
shall
know
more
in
a
little
time

I
do
n't
like
them

the
men
said

This

General
Ross

recommended
Newcomb

case
to
him
,
who
promises
to
join
with
me
in
working
up
the
Duke
of
Ormond
to
do
something

<EOS>
Lord
Winchelsea
told
me
to
-
day
at
Court
that
two
of
the
Mohocks
caught
a
maid
of
old
Lady
Winchelsea
's
,
at
the
door
of
their
house
in
the
Park
,
where
she
was
with
a
candle
,
and
had
just
lighted
out
somebody
.
 
<EOS>
They
cut
all
her
face
,
and
beat
her
without
any
provocation

I
hear
my

has
got

Mohock

The

I
dined
with
Crowe
,
late
Governor
of
Barbados

an
acquaintance

Sterne

<EOS>
After
dinner
I
asked
him
whether
he
had
heard
of
Sterne
.
 
<EOS>
"
Here
he
is

"
said
he
,
"
at
the
door
in

coach

<EOS>
and
in
came
Sterne
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
been
here
this
week

<EOS>
He
is
buying
a
captainship
in
his
cousin
Sterne

regiment

<EOS>
He
told
me
he
left
Jemmy
Leigh
playing
at
cards
with
you
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
to
give
800
guineas
for
his
commission

I
suppose
you
know
all
this
better

I.

thanks
for
getting

It
was

six
or
seven
weeks

spoke

Sacheverell
brought

him

We
dined
together

,
and
I
sat
with
them
till

<EOS>
I
little
thought
,
and
<EOS>
I
believe
so
did
he
,
that
ever
I
should
be
his
solicitor
to
the
present
Ministry
,
when
I
left
Ireland

This
is
the
seventh
I
have
now
provided
for

I
came

can
do
nothing

myself

I
do
n't
care

I
shall
have

other
people
obliged

me

Trapp
is
a

the
t'other
is
not

deep

and
their
judgment
in
things

sense
is

The
Second

I
walked
this
evening
in
the
Park
,
and
met
Prior
,
who
made
me
go
home
with
him
,
where
I
stayed
till
past
twelve
,
and
could
not
get
a
coach
,
and
was
alone
,
and
was
afraid
enough
of
the
Mohocks
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
do
so
no
more
,
though
I
got
home
safe
.
 
<EOS>
Prior
<EOS>
and
I
were
talking
discontentedly
of
some
managements
,
that
no
more
people
are
turned
out
,
which
get
Lord
Treasurer
many
enemies
:
but
whether
the
fault
be
in
him
,
or
the
Queen
,
I
know
not
;
I
doubt
,
in
both
.
<EOS>
Ung
omens
,
it
is
now
seven
weeks
since
I
received
your
last
;
but
I
expect
one
next
Irish
packet
,
to
fill
the
rest
of
this
paper
;
but
if
it
do
n't
come
,
I
'll
do
without
it
:
 
<EOS>
so
I
wish
oo
good
luck
at
ombre
with
the

Newcomb
came
to
me
this
morning
,
and
I
went
to
the
Duke
of
Ormond
to
speak
for
him
;
but
the
Duke
was
just
going
out
to
take
the
oaths
for
General
.
<EOS>
The
Duke
of
Shrewsbury
is
to
be
Lord
Lieutenant
of
Ireland
.
 
<EOS>
I
walked
with
Domville
and
Ford
to
Kensington
,
where
we
dined
,
and
it
cost
me
above
a
crown
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
like
it
,
as
the
man
said
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
very
windy
walking
.
 
<EOS>
I
saw
there
Lord
Masham
's
children
.
 
<EOS>
The
youngest
,
my
nephew
,
I
fear
,
has
got
the
king
's
evil
;
the
other
two
are
daughters
of
three
and
four
years
old
.
 
<EOS>
'
Twas
very
windy
walking
.
 
<EOS>
The
gardens
there
are
mighty
fine
.
 
<EOS>
I
passed
the
evening
at
Lord
Masham
's
with
Lord
Treasurer
and
Arbuthnot
,
as
usual
,
and
we
stayed
till
past
one
;
but
I
had
my
man
to
come
with
me
,
and
at
home
I
found
three
letters
;
one
from
one
Fetherston
,
a
parson
,
with
a
postscript
of
Tisdall
's
to
recommend
him
:
 
and
Fetherston
,
whom
I
never
saw
,
has
been
so
kind
to
give
me
a
letter
of
attorney
to
recover
a
debt
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
Another
from
Lord
Abercorn
,
to
get
him
the
dukedom
of
Chatelherault
from
the
King
of
France
;
in
which
I
will
do
what
I
can
,
for
his
pretensions
are
very
just
.
 
<EOS>
The
third
,
I
warrant
you
,
from
our
MD
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
a
great
stir
this
,
of
getting
a
dukedom
from
the
King
of
France
<EOS>
:
but
it
is
only
to
speak
to
the
Secretary
,
and
get
the
Duke
of
Ormond
to
engage
in
it
,
and
mention
the
case
to
Lord
Treasurer
,
etc
.
,
and
this
I
shall
do
.

I
was
with
the
Duke
of
Ormond
this
morning
,
about
Lord
Abercorn
,
Dr.
Freind
,
and
Newcomb
.
 
<EOS>
Some
will
do
,
and
some
will
not
do
;
that
's
wise
,
marams
.
 
<EOS>
The
Duke
of
Shrewsbury
is
certainly
to
be
your
Governor
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
go
in
a
day
or
two
,
and
give
the
Duchess
joy
,
and
recommend
the
Archbishop
of
Dublin
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
writ
to
the
Archbishop
,
some
months
ago
,
that
it
would
be
so
,
and
told
him
I
would
speak
a
good
word
for
him
to
the
Duchess
;
and
he
says
he
has
a
great
respect
for
her
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
I
made
our
Society
change
their
house
,
and
we
met
to
-
day
at
the
Star
and
Garter
in
the
Pall
Mall
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Arran
was
President
.
 
<EOS>
The
other
dog
was
so
extravagant
in
his
bills
,
that
for
four
dishes
and
four
,
first
and
second
course
,
without
wine
or
dessert
,
he
charged
twenty
-
one
pounds
,
six
shillings
,
and
eightpence
,
to
the
Duke
of
Ormond
.
 
<EOS>
We
design
,
when
all
have
been
Presidents
this
turn
,
to
turn
it
into
a
reckoning
of
so
much
a
head
;
but
we
shall
break
up
when
the
session
ends

Morning

<EOS>
Now
I
will
answer
MD
's
rettle
,
N.27
;
you
that
are
adding
to
your
number
and
grumbling
,
had
made
it
26
,
and
then
altered
it
to
27
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
it
is
above
a
month
since
your
last
;
yes
,
it
is
above
seven
weeks
since
I
had
your
last
:
 
<EOS>
but
I
ought
to
consider
that
this
was
twelve
days
right
,
so
that
makes
it
pretty
even
.
 
<EOS>
O
,
the
sirry
zade
,
with
her
excuses
of
a
fortnight
at
Ballygall
,
seeing
their
friends
,
and
landlord
running
away
.
 
<EOS>
O
Rold
,
hot
a
cruttle
and
a
bustle
!
 
<EOS>
No
 
if
you
will
have
it
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
Dean
of
Wells
,
nor
know
anything
of
being
so
;
nor
is
there
anything
in
the
story
;
and
that
's
enough
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
Roper
sent
that
news
:
 
<EOS>
Roper
is
my
humble
slave
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
I
heard
of
your
resolves
,
and
that
Burton
was
embroiled
.
 
<EOS>
Stratford
spoke
to
me
in
his
behalf
;
but
I
said
I
hated
the
rascal
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
Catherine
gone
to
Wales
?
 
<EOS>
But
she
will
come
back
again
,
I
hope
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
see
her
in
my
journey
,
if
she
were
near
the
road
;
and
bring
her
over

<EOS>
Joe
is
a
fool

that
sort
of
business
is
not
at
all
in

put

off

I

her
a

<EOS>
Who
would
have
her

<EOS>
Dilly
will
be
governed

and
she
will
govern

Is
not

<EOS>
Why
,
Sterne
told
me
he
left
you
at

with
Leigh
;
and
yet
you
never
saw
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
nothing
of
his

being
here

it
may
cost

I
do

<EOS>
He
is
a
little
in
doubt
about
buying
his
commission
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
I
will
bring
oo
over
all
the
little
papers
I
can
think
on
.
 
<EOS>
I
thought
I
sent
you
,
by
Leigh
,
all
that
were
good
at
that
time
.
 
<EOS>
The
author
of
the
Sea
Eclogues
sent
books
to
the
Society
yesterday
,
and
we
gave
him
guineas
apiece
;
and
,
maybe
,
will
do
further
from
him
(
for
him
,
I
mean
)
.
 
<EOS>
So
the
Bishop
of
Clogher
,
and
lady
,
were
your
guests
for
a
night
or
two
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
Ppt
,
you
are
grown
a
great
gamester
and
company
keeper

<EOS>
I
did
say
to
myself
,
when
I
read
those
names
,
just
what
you
guess
;
and
you
clear
up
the
matter
wonderfully
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
converse
with
those
two
nymphs
if
you
please
,
but

take

if
ever
I
do

Pray

God
keep

many

I
doubt
the
session
will
not
be
over
till
the
end
of
April
;
however
,
I
shall
not
wait
for
it
,
if
the
Ministry
will
let
me
go
sooner

<EOS>
I
wish
I
were
just

I

bring

my

which
you

I.

Oh

now
you
have
got
Number

<EOS>
Why

perhaps
,
I
forgot

and
kept
it
to
next
post
in
my
pocket
:
 
I
have
done
such
tricks

<EOS>
My

people

I
did

so
I
went

then
sat
with
Lord
Masham

there

had

the

I
went

to
Court
,
and
the
company
was
almost
gone

<EOS>
The
Court
serves
me
for
a
coffee

house
;
once
a
week
I
meet
acquaintance
there
,
that
I
should
not
otherwise
see
in
a
quarter
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
a
flying
report
that
the
French
have
offered
a
cessation
of
arms
,
and
to
give
us
Dunkirk
,
and
the
Dutch
Namur
,
for
security

till
the
peace
is
made

The
Duke
of
Ormond

they
say
,
goes
in
a
week
.
 
<EOS>
Abundance
of
his
equipage
is
already
gone
.
 
<EOS>
His
friends
are
afraid
the
expense
of
this
employment
will
ruin
him
,
since
he
must
lose
the
government
of
Ireland
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
privately
with
a
friend
,
and
refused
all
dinners
offered
me
at
Court
;
which
,
however
,
were
but
two
,
and
I
did
not
like
either
.
 
<EOS>
Did
I
tell
you
of
a
scoundrel
about
the
Court
that
sells
employments
to
ignorant
people
,
and
cheats
them
of
their
money
?
 
<EOS>
He
lately
made
a
bargain
for
the
Vice
-
Chamberlain
's
place
,
for
seven
thousand
pounds
,
and
had
received
some
guineas
earnest
;
but
the
whole
thing
was
discovered
t'other
day
,
and
examination
taken
of
it
by
Lord
Dartmouth
,
and
I
hope
he
will
be
swinged
.
 
<EOS>
The
Vice

Chamberlain
told
me
several
particulars
of
it
last
night
at

left

Then
I

to
her
about
the
Duke
's
being
Lord
Lieutenant
.
 
<EOS>
She
said
she
knew
nothing
of
it
;
but
I
rallied
her
out
of
that
,
and
she
resolves
not
to
stay
behind
the
Duke
.
 
<EOS>
I
intend
to
recommend
the
Bishop
of
Clogher
to
her
for
an
acquaintance
.
 
<EOS>
He
will
like
her
very
well
<EOS>
:
she
is
,
indeed
,
a
most
agreeable
woman
,
and
a
great
favourite
of
mine
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
not
whether
the
ladies
in
Ireland
will
like
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
at
the
Court
of
Requests
,
to
get
some
lords
to
be
at
a
committee
to
-
morrow
,
about
a
friend
's
Bill
:
 
and
then
the
Duke
of
Beaufort
gave
me
a
poem
,
finely
bound
in
folio
,
printed
at
Stamford
,
and
writ
by
a
country
squire
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Exeter
desired
the
Duke
to
give
it
the
Queen
,
because
the
author
is
his
friend
;
but
the
Duke
desired
I
would
let
him
know
whether
it
was
good
for
anything
.
 
<EOS>
I
brought
it
home
,
and
will
return
it
to
-
morrow
,
as
the
dullest
thing
I
ever
read
;
and
advise
the
Duke
not
to
present
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
with
Domville
at
his
lodgings
,
by
invitation
;
for
he
goes
in
a
few
days
for
Ireland
.

twelve

Above
five

Dr.

I
dined

Our
news
about
a

begins

I
have
not
these

seen
anybody

ask

We
had

I

that
on
Sunday
last
,
about
seven
at
night
<EOS>
,
it
lightened
above
fifty
times
as
I
walked
the
Mall
,
which
I
think
is
extraordinary
at
this
time
of
the

,
and
the
weather
was
very
hot

<EOS>
Had
you
anything
of
this
in

I
intended
to
dine
with
Lord

to

Lord
Mansel

made
me
dine
with

The
news
of
the
French
desiring
a
cessation

was

We
shall
know

am

whether
there
will
be

I
believe
I
shall
lose
credit
with
you
by
not
coming
over
at
the
beginning
of
April
;
but
I
hoped
the
session
would
be
ended

I
must
stay
till
then

yet
I
would

be
at

Dr.

was
President
.
 
<EOS>
His
dinner
was
dressed
in
the
Queen
's
kitchen
,
and
was
mighty
fine
.
 
<EOS>
We
ate
it
at
Ozinda
's
Chocolate
-
house
,
just
by
St.
James
's
.
 
<EOS>
We
were
never
merrier
,
nor
better
company
,
and
did
not
part
till
after
eleven
.
 
<EOS>
I
did
not
summon
Lord
Lansdowne
:
 
<EOS>
he
and
I
are
fallen
out
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
something
in
an
Examiner
a
fortnight
ago
that
he
thought
reflected
on
the
abuses
in
his
office
(
he
is
Secretary
at
War
)
,
and
he
writ
to
the
Secretary
that
he
heard
I
had
inserted
that
paragraph
.
 
<EOS>
This
I
resented
highly
,
that
he
should
complain
of
me
before
he
spoke
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
sent
him
a
peppering
letter
,
and
would
not
summon
him
by
a
note
,
as
I
did
the
rest
;
nor
ever
will
have
anything
to
say
to
him
,

he
begs
my
pardon

I
met
Lord

to

at
Lady
Masham

He
would
fain
have
carried
me
home

I
begged

I
dined
with
Lord

three

four
fellows
I
never
saw
before

<EOS>
I
left
them
at

came
home

have
been
writing
to
the
Archbishop
of
Dublin

cousin
Deane

in
answer
to
one
of
his
of
four
months
old

I
spied
by
chance

routing
among

<EOS>
I
have
a
pain
these
two
days
exactly
upon
the
top
of
my
left
shoulder

<EOS>
I
fear
it
is
something
rheumatic
;
it
winches
now
and
then
.
 
<EOS>
Shall
I
put
flannel
to
it
?
<EOS>
Domville
is
going

Does
the
Bishop
of
Clogher
talk
of
coming
for
England
this
summer

<EOS>
I
think
Lord
Molesworth
told
me
so
about
two
months

The
weather
is
bad
again

rainy

very
cold

Do
you
know

A
projector
has
been
applying
himself
to
me
,
to
recommend
him
to
the
Ministry
,
because
he
pretends
to
have
found
out
the
longitude
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
he
has
no
more
found
it
out
than
he
has
found
out
mine
.

However

I
will

Mr.

and
I
dined
with
Mr.
Domville

take

<EOS>
I
drank
three
or
four
glasses
of
champagne
by
perfect
teasing
,
though
it
is
bad
for
my
pain
;
but
if
it
continue
,
I
will
not
drink
any
wine
without
water
till
I
am
well

The
weather
is
abominably
cold

wet

I
am
got
into
bed

and
have
put
some
old
flannel
,
for
want
of
new
,
to
my
shoulder
,
and
rubbed
it
with
Hungary
water
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
plaguy
hard
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
would
drink
any
wine
,
if
it
were
not
for
my
head
,
and
drinking
has
given
me
this
pain

I
will
try
abstemiousness
for
a

How
does
MD
do

how

I
hate
pain

said

go

water

My
man
is

Do
you
know
that
t'other
day
he
was
forced
to
beg
my
pardon
,
that
he
could
not
shave
my
head

his
hand
shook
so

He
is
drunk
every

,
and
I
design
to
turn
him
off
soon
as
ever
<EOS>
I
get
to
Ireland
.
<EOS>
I
'll
write
no

am

The

collar

that
side
my
neck

<EOS>
On
Thursday
morning
appeared
great
red
spots
in
all
those
places
where
my
pain
was
,
and
the
violence
of
the
pain
was
confined
to
my
neck
behind
,
a
little
on
the
left
side
;
which
was
so
violent
that
I
had
not
a
minute
's
ease

nor
hardly
a
minute
's
sleep
in
three
days

nights

The
spots
increased
every
day

and
bred
little
pimples

which
are
now
grown
white

full

LONDON

<EOS>
I
had
your

-
eighth
two
or
three
days
ago
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
hardly
answer
it
now
.
<EOS>
Since
my
last
I
have
been
extremely
ill
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
this
day
just
a
month
since
I
felt
a
small
pain
on
the
tip
of
my
left
shoulder
,
which
grew
worse
,
and
spread
for
six
days
;
then
broke
all
out
by
my
collar
and
left
side
of
my
neck
in
monstrous
red
spots
inflamed
,
and
these
grew
to
small
pimples
.
 
<EOS>
For
four
days
I
had
no
rest
,
nor
nights
,
for
a
pain
in
my
neck
;
then
I
grew
a
little
better
;
afterward
,
where
my
pains
were
,
a
cruel
itching
seized
me
,
beyond
whatever
I
could
imagine
,
and
kept
me
awake
several
nights
.
 
<EOS>
I
rubbed
it
vehemently
,
but
did
not
scratch
it
:
 
<EOS>
then
it
grew
into
three
or
four
great
sores
like
blisters
,
and
run
;
at
last
I
advised
the
doctor
to
use
it
like
a
blister
,
so
I
did
with
melilot
plasters
,
which
still
run
:
 
and
am
now
in
pain
enough
,
but
am
daily
mending
.
 
<EOS>
I
kept
my
chamber
a
fortnight
,
then
went
out
a
day
or
two
,
but
then
confined
myself
again
.
 
<EOS>
Two
days

I
went
to
a

to
dine

yesterday
again
kept

I
never

so
much
in

<EOS>
I
have
taken
my

two
inches

I

leaner

LETTER
46
.
 
<EOS>
LONDON
,
May
10
,
1712
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
not
yet
ease
or
humour
enough
to
go
on
in
my
journal
method
,
though
I
have
left
my
chamber
these
ten
days
.
 
<EOS>
My
pain
continues
still
in
my
shoulder
and
collar
:
I
keep
flannel
on
it
,
and
rub
it
with
brandy
,
and
take
a
nasty
diet
drink
.
 
<EOS>
I
still
itch
terribly
,
and
have
some
few
pimples
;
I
am
weak
,
and
sweat
;
and
then
the
flannel
makes
me
mad
with
itching
;
but
I
think
my
pain
lessens
.
 
<EOS>
A
journal
,
while
I
was
sick
,
would
have
been
a
noble
thing
,
made
up
of
pain
and
physic
,
visits
,
and
messages
;
<EOS>
the
two
last
were
almost
as
troublesome
as
the
two
first
.
 
<EOS>
One
good
circumstance
is
that
I
am
grown
much
leaner
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
I
told
you
that
I
have
taken
in
my
breeches
two
inches
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
your
N.29
last
night
.
 
<EOS>
In
answer
to
your
good
opinion
of
my
disease
,
the
doctors
said
they
never
saw
anything
so
odd
of
the
kind
;
they
were
not
properly
shingles
,
but
herpes
miliaris
,
and
twenty
other
hard
names
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
never
be
sick
like
other
people
,
but
always
something
out
of
the
common
way
;
and
as
for
your
notion
of
its
coming
without
pain
,
it
neither
came
,
nor
stayed
,
nor
went
without
pain
,
and
the
most
pain
I
ever
bore
in
my
life
.
<EOS>
Medemeris
is
retired
in
the
country
,
with
the
beast
her
husband
,
long
ago
.
<EOS>
I
thank
the
Bishop
of
Clogher
for
his
proxy
;
I
will
write
to
him
soon
.
 
<EOS>
Here
is
Dilly
's
wife
in
town
;
but
I
have
not
seen
her
yet
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
sinkerton
:
 
'
tis
not
a
sign
of
health
,
but
a
sign
that
,
if
it
had
not
come
out
,
some
terrible
fit
of
sickness
would
have
followed
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
at
our
Society
last
Thursday
,
to
receive
a
new
member
,
the
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
;
but
I
drink
nothing
above
wine
and
water
.
 
<EOS>
We
shall
have
a
peace
,
I
hope
,
soon
,
or
at
least
entirely
broke
;
but
I
believe
the
first
.
 
<EOS>
My
Letter
to
Lord
Treasurer
,
about
the
English
tongue
,
is
now
printing
;
and
I
suffer
my
name
to
be
put
at
the
end
of
it
,
which
I
never
did
before
in
my
life
.
 
<EOS>
The
Appendix
to
the
Third
Part
of
John
Bull
was
published
yesterday
;
it
is
equal
to
the
rest
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
you
read
John
Bull
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
Scotch
gentleman
,
a
friend
of
mine
,
that
writ
it
;
but
they
put
it
upon
me
.
 
<EOS>
The
Parliament
will
hardly
be
up
till
June
.
 
<EOS>
We
were
like
to
be
undone
some
days
ago
with
a
tack
;
but
we
carried
it
bravely
,
and
the
Whigs
came
in
to
help
us
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
Lady
Masham
,
I
am
afraid
,
will
lose
her
only
son
,
<EOS>
about
a
twelvemonth
old
,
with
the
king
's
evil
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
would
let
Mrs.
Fenton
see
me
during
my
illness
,
though
she
often
came
;
but
she
has
been
once
here
since
I
recovered
.
 
<EOS>
Bernage
has
been
twice
to
see
me
of
late
.
<EOS>
His
regiment
will
be
broke
,
and
he
only
upon
half
-
pay
;
so
perhaps
he
thinks
he
will
want
me
again
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
told
here
the
Bishop
of
Clogher
and
family
are
coming
over
,
but
he
says
nothing
of
it
himself
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
returning
the
visits
of
those
that
sent
howdees
in
my
sickness
;
particularly
the
Duchess
of
Hamilton
,
who
came
and
sat
with
me
two
hours
.
 
<EOS>
I
make
bargains
with
all
people
that
I
dine
with
,
to
let
me
scrub
my
back
against
a
chair
;
and
the
Duchess
of
Ormond
was
forced
to
bear
it
the
other
day
.
 
<EOS>
Many
of
my
friends
are
gone
to
Kensington
,
where
the
Queen
has
been
removed
for
some
time
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
a
long
letter
for
a
kick
body
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
begin
the
next
in
the
journal
way
,
though
my
journals
will
be
sorry
ones
.
 
<EOS>
My
left
hand
is
very
weak
,
and
trembles
;
but
my
right
side
has
not
been
touched
.
       
<EOS>
This
is
a
pitiful
letter
     
<EOS>
For
want
of
a
better
;
     
But
plagued
with
a
tetter
,
     
<EOS>
My
fancy
does
fetter
.
  
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
my
poor
willows
and
quicksets
!
 
<EOS>
Well
,
but
you
must
read
John
Bull
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
understand
it
all
?
 
<EOS>
Did
I
tell
you
that
young
Parson
Gery
is
going
to
be
married
,
and
asked
my
advice
when
it
was
too
late
to
break
off
?
 
<EOS>
He
tells
me
Elwick
has
purchased
forty
pounds
a
year
in
land
adjoining
to
his

LETTER
47

<EOS>
LONDON
,
May
31
,
1712
.
  
<EOS>
I
can
not
yet
arrive
to
my
journal
letters
,
my
pains
continuing
still
,
though
with
less
violence
;
but
I
do
n't
love
to
write
journals
while
I
am
in
pain
;
and
above
all
,
not
journals
to
MD
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
however
,
I
am
so
much
mended
,
<EOS>
that
I
intend
my
next
<EOS>
shall
be
in
the
old
way
;
and
yet
I
shall
,
perhaps
,
break
my
resolution
when
I
feel
pain
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
I
have
lost
credit
with
you
,
in
relation
to
my
coming
over
;
but
I
protest
it
is
impossible
for
one
who
has
anything
to
do
with
this
Ministry
to
be
certain
when
he
fixes
any
time
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
a
business
which
,
till
it
take
some
turn
or
other
,
I
can
not
leave
this
place
in
prudence
or
honour
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
never
wished
so
much
as
now
that
I
had
stayed
in
Ireland
;
but
the
die
is
cast
,
and
is
now
a
spinning
,
and
till
it
settles
,
I
can
not
tell
whether
it
be
an
ace
or
a
sise
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
confident
by
what
you
know
yourselves
,
that
you
will
justify
me
in
all
this
.
 
<EOS>
The
moment
I
am
used
ill
,
I
will
leave
them
;
but
know
not
how
to
do
it
while
things
are
in
suspense
.
<EOS>
The
session
will
soon
be
over
(
I
believe
in
a
fortnight
)
,
and
the
peace
,
we
hope
,
will
be
made
in
a
short
time
;
and
there
will
be
no
further
occasion
for
me
;
nor
have
I
anything
to
trust
to
<EOS>
but
Court
gratitude
,
so
that
I
expect
to
see
my
willows
a
month
after
the
Parliament
is
up
:
 
<EOS>
but
I
will
take
MD
in
my
way
,
and
not
go
to
Laracor
like
an
unmannerly
spraenekich
ferrow
.
 
<EOS>
Have
you
seen
my
Letter
to
Lord
Treasurer
?
 
<EOS>
There
are
two
answers
come
out
to
it
already
;
though
it
is
no
politics
,
but
a
harmless
proposal
about
the
improvement
of
the
English
Tongue
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
if
I
writ
an
essay
upon
a
straw
some
fool
would
answer
it
.
 
<EOS>
About
ten
days
hence
I
expect
a
letter
from
MD
;
N.30
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
now
writing
it
,
near
the
end
,
as
I
guess
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
received
DD
's
money
;
but
I
will
give
you
a
note
for
it
on
Parvisol
,
and
bed
oo
paadon
I
have
not
done
it
before
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
just
now
thinking
to
go
lodge
at
Kensington
for
the
air
.
 
<EOS>
Lady
Masham
has
teased
me
to
do
it
,
but
business
has
hindered
me
;
but
now
Lord
Treasurer
has
removed
thither
.
 
<EOS>
Fifteen
of
our
Society
dined
together
under
a
canopy
in
an
arbour
at
Parson
's
Green
last
Thursday
:
 
I
never
saw
anything
so
fine
and
romantic
.
 
<EOS>
We
got
a
great
victory
last
Wednesday
in
the
House
of
Lords
by
a
majority
,
I
think
,
of
twenty
-
eight
;
and
the
Whigs
had
desired
their
friends
to
bespeak
places
to
see
Lord
Treasurer
carried
to
the
Tower
.
 
<EOS>
I
met
your
Higgins
here
yesterday
:
he
roars
at
the
insolence
of
the
Whigs
in
Ireland
,
talks
much
of
his
own
sufferings
and
expenses
in
asserting
the
cause
of
the
Church
;
and
I
find
he
would
fain
plead
merit
enough
to
desire
that
his
fortune
should
be
mended
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
he
designs
to
make
as
much
noise
as
he
can
in
order
to
preferment
.
<EOS>
Pray
let
the
Provost
,
when
he
sees
you
,
give
you
ten
English
shillings
,
and
I
will
give
as
much
here
to
the
man
who
delivered
me
Rymer
's
books
:
 
<EOS>
he
knows
the
meaning
.
 
<EOS>
Tell
him
I
will
not
trust
him
,
but
that
you
can
order
it
to
be
paid
me
here
;
and
I
will
trust
you
till
I
see
you
.
 
<EOS>
Have
I
told
you
that
the
rogue
Patrick
has
left
me
these
two
months
,
to
my
great
satisfaction
?
 
<EOS>
I
have
got
another
,
who
seems
to
be
much
better
,
if
he
continues
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
printing
a
threepenny
pamphlet
,
and
shall
print
another
in
a
fortnight
,
and
then
I
have
done
,
unless
some
new
occasion
starts
.
 
<EOS>
Is
my
curate
Warburton
married
to
Mrs.
Melthrop
in
my
parish
?
<EOS>
so
I
hear
.
 
<EOS>
Or
is
it
a
lie
?
 
<EOS>
Has
Raymond
got
to
his
new
house
?
 
<EOS>
Do
you
see
Joe

and

What

you

<EOS>
How
stands

<EOS>
My
service
to
Mrs.
Stoyte
,
and
Catherine
,
if
she
be
come
from
Wales
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
yet
seen
Dilly
Ashe
's
wife
.
 
<EOS>
I
called
once
,
but
she
was
not
at
home
:
 
<EOS>
I
think
she
is
under
the
doctor
's
hand
.
.
.
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
the
news
of
the
Duke
of
Ormond
producing
letters
in
the
council
of
war
,
with
orders
not
to
fight
,
will
surprise
you
in
Ireland
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Treasurer
said
in
the
House
of
Lords
that
in
a
few
days
the
treaty
of
peace
should
be
laid
before
them
;
and
our
Court
thought
it
wrong
to
hazard
a
battle
,
and
sacrifice
many
lives
in
such
a
juncture
.
 
<EOS>
If
the
peace
holds
,
all
will
do
well
,
otherwise
I
know
not
how
we
shall
weather
it
.
 
<EOS>
And
it
was
reckoned
as
a
wrong
step
in
politics
for
Lord
Treasurer
to
open
himself
so
much
.
 
<EOS>
The
Secretary
would
not
go
so
far
to
satisfy
the
Whigs
in
the
House
of
Commons
;
but
there
all
went
swimmingly
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
say
no
more
to
oo
to
-
nite
,
sellohs
,
because
I
must
send
away
the
letter
,
not

and
besides
,
I
have
not
much

KENSINGTON
,
June
17
,
1712
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
been
so
tosticated
about
since
my
last
,
that
I
could
not
go
on
in
my
journal
manner
,
though
my
shoulder
is
a
great
deal
better
;
however
,
I
feel
constant
pain
in
it
,
but
I
think
it
diminishes
,
and
I
have
cut
off
some
slices
from
my
flannel
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
lodged
here
near
a
fortnight
,
partly
for
the
air
and
exercise
,
partly
to
be
near
the
Court
,
where
dinners
are
to
be
found
.
 
<EOS>
I
generally
get
a
lift
in
a
coach
to
town
,
and
in
the
evening
I
walk
back
.
 
<EOS>
On
Saturday
I
dined
with
the
Duchess
of
Ormond
at
her
lodge
near
Sheen
,
and
thought
to
get
a
boat
back
as
usual
.
 
<EOS>
I
walked
by
the
bank
to
Cue
[
Kew
]
,
but
no
boat
,
then
to
Mortlake
,
but
no
boat
,
and
it
was
nine
o'clock

At
last
a
little
sculler
called
,
full
of
nasty
people
.
 
<EOS>
I
made
him
set
me
down
at
Hammersmith
,
so
walked
two
miles
to
this
place
,
and
got
here
by
eleven
.
 
<EOS>
Last
night
I
had
another
such
difficulty
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
in
the
City
till
past
ten
at
night
;
it
rained
hard
,
but
no
coach
to
be
had
.
 
<EOS>
It
gave
over
a
little
,
and
I
walked
all
the
way
here
,
and
got
home
by
twelve
.
 
<EOS>
I
love
these
shabby
difficulties
when
they
are
over
;
but
I
hate
them
,
because
they
arise
from
not
having
a
thousand
pound
a
year
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
your
N.30
about
three
days
ago
,
which
I
will
now
answer
.
 
<EOS>
And
first
,
I
did
not
relapse
,
but
found
I
came
out
before
I
ought
;
and
so
,
and
so
,
as
I
have
told
you
in
some
of
my
last
.
 
<EOS>
The
first
coming
abroad
made
people
think
I
was
quite
recovered
,
and
I
had
no
more
messages
afterwards
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
but
John
Bull
is
not
writ
by
the
person
you
imagine
,
as
hope
!
 
<EOS>
It
is
too
good
for
another
to
own
.
 
<EOS>
Had
it
been
Grub
Street
<EOS>
,
I
would
have
let
people
think
as
they
please
;
and
I
think
that
's
right
:
 
is
not
it
now
?
<EOS>
so
flap
ee
hand
,
and
make
wry
<EOS>
mouth
oo
-
self
,
sauci
doxi
.
 
<EOS>
Now
comes
DD
.
 
<EOS>
Why
sollah
,
I
did
write
in
a
fortnight
my
47th
;
and
if
it
did
not
come
in
due
time
,
can
I
help
wind
and
weather
?
<EOS>
am
I
a
Laplander
?
<EOS>
am
I
a
witch
?
<EOS>
can
I
work
miracles
?
<EOS>
can
I
make
easterly
winds
?
 
<EOS>
Now
I
am
against
Dr.
Smith
.
 
<EOS>
I
drink
little
water
with
my
wine
,
yet
I
believe
he
is
right
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
Dr.
Cockburn
told
me
a
little
wine
would
not
hurt
me
;
but
it
is
so
hot
and
dry
,
and
water
is
so
dangerous
.
 
<EOS>
The
worst
thing
here
is
my
evenings
at
Lord
Masham
's
,
where
Lord
Treasurer
comes
,
and
we
sit
till
after
twelve
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
is
convenient
<EOS>
I
should
be
among
them
for
a
while
as
much
as
possible
.
 
<EOS>
I
need
not
tell
oo
why
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
hope
that
will
be
at
an
end
in
a
month
or
two
,
one
way
or
other
,
and
I
am
resolved
it
shall
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
ca
n't
go
to
Tunbridge
,
or
anywhere
else
out
of
the
way
,
in
this
juncture
.
 
<EOS>
So
Ppt
designs
for
Templeoag
<EOS>
(
what
a
name
is
that
!
)
.
 
<EOS>
Whereabouts
is
that
place
?
 
<EOS>
I
hope
not
very
far
from
Dublin
.
<EOS>
Higgins
is
here
,
roaring
that
all
is
wrong
in
Ireland
,
and
would
have
me
get
him
an
audience
of
Lord
Treasurer
to
tell
him
so
;
but
I
will
have
nothing
to
do
in
it
,
no
,
not
I
,
faith
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
had
no
thunder
till
last
night
,
and
till
then
we
were
dead
for
want
of
rain
;
but
there
fell
a
great
deal
:
 
<EOS>
no
field
looked
green
.
 
<EOS>
I
reckon
the
Queen
will
go
to
Windsor
in
three
or
four
weeks
:
and
if
the
Secretary
takes
a
house
there
,
I
shall
be
sometimes
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
But
how
affectedly
Ppt
talks
of
my
being
here
all
the
summer
;
which
I
do
not
intend
:
 
nor
<EOS>
to
stay
one
minute
longer
in
England
than
becomes
the
circumstances
I
am
in
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
you
would
go
soon
into
the
country
,
and
take
a
good
deal
of
it
;
and
where
better
than
Trim
?
 
<EOS>
Joe
will
be
your
humble
servant
,
Parvisol
your
slave
,
and
Raymond
at
your
command
,
for
he
piques
himself
on
good
manners
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
seen
Dilly
's
wife
 
<EOS>
and
I
have
seen
once
or
twice
<EOS>
old
Bradley
here
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
very
well
,
very
old
,
and
very
wise
:
 
<EOS>
I
believe
I
must
go
see
his
wife
,
when
I
have
leisure
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
be
glad
to
see
Goody
Stoyte
and
her
husband
;
pray
give
them
my
humble
service
,
and
to
Catherine
,
and
to
Mrs.
Walls
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
the
least
bit
in
love
with
Mrs.
Walls
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
the
cares
of
the
husband
increase
with
the
fruitfulness
of
the
wife
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
grad
at
halt
to
hear
of
Ppt
's
good
health
:
 
<EOS>
pray
let
her
finish
it
by
drinking
waters
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
DD
had
her
bill
,
and
has
her
money
.
 
<EOS>
Remember
to
write
a
due
time
before
ME
money
is
wanted
,
and
be
good
galls
,
dood
dallars
,
I
mean
,
and
no
crying
dallars
.
 
<EOS>
I
heard
somebody
coming
upstairs
,
and
forgot
I
was
in
the
country
;
and
I
was
afraid
of
a
visitor
:
 
<EOS>
that
is
one
advantage
of
being
here
,
that
I
am
not
teased
with
solicitors
.
 
<EOS>
Molt
,
the
chemist
,
is
my
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
My
service
to
Dr.
Smith
.
 
<EOS>
I
sent
the
question
to
him
about
Sir
Walter
Raleigh
's
cordial
,
and
the
answer
he
returned
is
in
these
words
:
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
directly
after
Mr.
Boyle
's
receipt
.
"
 
<EOS>
That
commission
is
performed
;
if
he
wants
any
of
it
,
Molt
shall
use
him
fairly
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
Smith
is
one
of
your
physicians
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
now
your
letter
is
fully
and
impartially
answered
;
not
as
rascals
answer
me
:
 
<EOS>
I
believe
,
if
I
writ
an
essay
upon
a
straw
,
I
should
have
a
shoal
of
answerers
:
 
but
no
matter
for
that
;
you
see
I
can
answer
without
making
any
reflections
,
as
becomes
men
of
learning
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
but
now
for
the
peace
:
 
<EOS>
why
,
we
expect
it
daily
;
but
the
French
have
the
staff
in
their
own
hands
,
and
we
trust
to
their
honesty
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
it
were
otherwise
.
 
<EOS>
Things
are
now
in
the
way
of
being
soon
in
the
extremes
of
well
or
ill
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
and
believe
the
first
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Wharton
is
gone
out
of
town
in
a
rage
,
and
curses
himself
and
friends
for
ruining
themselves
in
defending
Lord
Marlborough
and
Godolphin
,
and
taking
Nottingham
into
their
favour
.
 
<EOS>
He
swears
he
will
meddle
no
more
during
this
reign
;
a
pretty
speech
at
sixty
-
six
,
and
the
Queen
is
near
twenty
years
younger
,
and
now
in
very
good
health
;
for
you
must
know
her
health
is
fixed
by
a
certain
reason
,
that
she
has
done
with
braces
(
I
must
use
the
expression
)
,
and
nothing
ill
is
happened
to
her
since
;
so
she
has
a
new
lease
of
her
life
.
 
<EOS>
Read

<EOS>
Do

Why

you

so

<EOS>
I
mean
does
DD
read

Ppt

<EOS>
Do
you
walk
?
 
<EOS>
I
think
Ppt
should
walk
to
DD
;
as
DD
reads
to
Ppt
,
for
Ppt
oo
must
know
is
a
good
walker
;
but
not
so
good
as
Pdfr

<EOS>
I
intend

but
it
threatens
rain

I

late
to
get

;
and
I
must
write
to
the
Bishop
of
Clogher
.

LETTER
49
.
 
<EOS>
KENSINGTON
,
July
1
,
1712
.
  
<EOS>
I
never
was
in
a
worse
station
for
writing
letters
than
this
,
especially
for
writing
to
MD
,
since
I
left
off
my
journals
.
 
<EOS>
For
I
go
to
town
early
;
and
when
I
come
home
at
night
,
I
generally
go
to
Lord
Masham
,
where
Lord
Treasurer
comes
,
and
we
stay
till
past
twelve
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
am
now
resolved
to
write
journals
again
,
though
my
shoulder
is
not
yet
well
;
for
I
have
still
a
few
itching
pimples
,
and
a
little
pain
now
and
then
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
now
high
cherry
-
time
with
us
;
take
notice
,
is
it
so
soon
with
you
?
 
<EOS>
And
we
have
early
apricots
,
and
gooseberries
are
ripe
.
 
<EOS>
On
Sunday
Archdeacon
Parnell
came
here
to
see
me
.
 
<EOS>
It
seems
he
has
been
ill
for
grief
of
his
wife
's
death
,
and
has
been
two
months
at
the
Bath
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
a
mind
to
go
to
Dunkirk
with
Jack
Hill
,
and
I
persuade
him
to
it
,
and
have
spoke
to
Hill
to
receive
him
;
but
I
doubt
he
wo
n't
have
spirit
to
go
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
made
Ford
Gazetteer
,
and
got
two
hundred
pounds
a
year
settled
on
the
employment
by
the
Secretary
of
State
,
beside
the
perquisites
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
the
prettiest
employment
in
England
of
its
bigness
;
yet
the
puppy
does
not
seem
satisfied
with
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
people
keep
some
follies
to
themselves
,
till
they
have
occasion
to
produce
them
.
 
<EOS>
He
thinks
it
not
genteel
enough
,
and
makes
twenty
difficulties
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
impossible
to
make
any
man
easy
.
 
<EOS>
His
salary
is
paid
him
every
week
,
if
he
pleases
,
without
taxes
or
abatements
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
little
to
do
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
a
pretty
office
,
with
coals
,
candles
,
papers
,
etc
.
<EOS>
;
can
frank
what
letters
he
will
;
and
his
perquisites
,
if
he
takes
care
,
may
be
worth
one
hundred
pounds
more
.
 
<EOS>
I
hear
the
Bishop
of
Clogher
is
landing
,
or
landed
,
in
England
;
and
I
hope
to
see
him
in
a
few
days
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
to
see
Mrs.
Bradley
on
Sunday
night
.
 
<EOS>
Her
youngest
son
is
married
to
somebody
worth
nothing
,
and
her
daughter
was
forced
to
leave
Lady
Giffard
,
because
she
was
striking
up
an
intrigue
with
a
footman
,
who
played
well
upon
the
flute
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
the
mother
's
account
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
Yesterday
the
old
Bishop
of
Worcester
,
who
pretends
to
be
a
prophet
,
went
to
the
Queen
,
by
appointment
,
to
prove
to
Her
Majesty
,
out
of
Daniel
and
the
Revelations
,
that
four
years
hence
there
would
be
a
war
of
religion
;
that
the
King
of
France
would
be
a
Protestant
,
and
fight
on
their
side
;
that
the
Popedom
would
be
destroyed
,
etc
.
;
and
declared
that
he
would
be
content
to
give
up
his
bishopric
if
it
were
not
true
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Treasurer
,
who
told
it
me
,
was
by
,
and
some
others
;
and
I
am
told
Lord
Treasurer
confounded
him
sadly
in
his
own
learning
,
which
made
the
old
fool
very
quarrelsome
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
near
ninety
years
old
.
 
<EOS>
Old
Bradley
is
fat
and
lusty
,
and
has
lost
his
palsy
.
 
<EOS>
Have
you
seen
Toland
's
Invitation
to
Dismal
?
 
<EOS>
How
do
you
like
it
?
 
<EOS>
But
it
is
an
imitation
of
Horace
,
and
perhaps
you
do
n't
understand
Horace
.
 
<EOS>
Here
has
been
a
great
sweep
of
employments
,
and
we
expect
still
more
removals
.
 
<EOS>
The
Court
seems
resolved
to
make
thorough
work
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Hill
intended
to
set
out
to
-
morrow
for
Dunkirk
,
of
which
he
is
appointed
Governor
;
but
he
tells
me
to
-
day
that
he
can
not
go
till
Thursday
or
Friday
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
it
were
over
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Secretary
tells
me
he
is
[
in
]
<EOS>
no
fear
at
all
that
France
will
play
tricks
with
us
.
 
<EOS>
If
we
have
Dunkirk
once
,
all
is
safe
.
 
<EOS>
We
rail
now
all
against
the
Dutch
,
who
,
indeed
,
have
acted
like
knaves
,
fools
,
and
madmen
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Secretary
is
soon
to
be
made
a
viscount
.
 
<EOS>
He
desired
I
would
draw
the
preamble
of
his
patent
;
but
I
excused
myself
from
a
work
that
might
lose
me
a
great
deal
of
reputation
,
and
get
me
very
little
.
 
<EOS>
We
would
fain
have
the
Court
make
him
an
earl
,
but
it
would
not
be
;
and
therefore
he
will
not
take
the
title
of
Bullenbrook
,
which
is
lately
extinct
in
the
elder
branch
of
his
family
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
advised
him
to
be
called
Lord
Pomfret
;
but
he
thinks
that
title
is
already
in
some
other
family
;
and
,
besides
,
he
objects
that
it
is
in
Yorkshire
,
where
he
has
no
estate
;
but
there
is
nothing
in
that
,
and
I
love
Pomfret
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
love
Pomfret
?
 
<EOS>
Why
?
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
in
all
our
histories
;
they
are
full
of
Pomfret
Castle
.
<EOS>
But
what
's
all
this
to
you
?
 
<EOS>
You
do
n't
care
for
this
.
 
<EOS>
Is
Goody
Stoyte
come
to
London
?
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
heard
of
her
yet
.
 
<EOS>
The
Dean
of
St.
Patrick
's
never
had
the
manners
to
answer
my
letter
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
t'other
day
to
see
Sterne
and
his
wife
.
 
<EOS>
She
is
not
half
so
handsome
as
when
I
saw
her
with
you
at
Dublin
.
 
<EOS>
They
design
to
pass
the
summer
at
a
house
near
Lord
Somers
's
,
about
a
dozen
miles
off
.
 
<EOS>
You
never
told
me
how
my
"
Letter
to
Lord
Treasurer
"
passes
in
Ireland
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
you
are
drinking
at
this
time
Temple
-
something
's
waters
.
 
<EOS>
Steele
was
arrested
the
other
day
for
making
a

He
is
now
under
prosecution

but
they
think
it
will
be
dropped
out
of
pity

<EOS>
I
believe
he
will
very
soon
lose
his
employment

for
he
has
been
mighty
impertinent
of
late
in
his
Spectators

I

never

his
behalf

We
have
had
very
little
hot
weather
during
the
whole
month
of
June

and
for
a
week
past
we
have
had
a
great
deal
of

not
every

I

LETTER

<EOS>
KENSINGTON
,
July
17
,
1712
.
  
<EOS>
I
am
weary
of
living
in
this
place
,
and
glad
to
leave
it
soon
.
 
<EOS>
The
Queen
goes
on
Tuesday
to
Windsor
,
and
I
shall
follow
in
three
or
four
days
after
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
do
nothing
here
,
going
early
to
London
,
and
coming
late
from
it
,
and
supping
at
Lady
Masham
's
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
to
-
day
with
the
Duke
of
Argyle
at
Cue
[
Kew
]
,
and
would
not
go
to
the
Court
to
-
night
,
because
of
writing
to
MD
.
 
<EOS>
The
Bishop
of
Clogher
has
been
here
this
fortnight
:
 
<EOS>
I
see
him
as
often
as
I
can
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
Master
Ashe
has
a
sad
redness
in
his
face
;
it
is
St.
Anthony
's
fire
;
his
face
all
swelled
,
and
will
break
in
his
cheek
,
but
no
danger
.
 
<EOS>
Since
Dunkirk
has
been
in
our
hands
,
Grub
Street
has
been
very
fruitful
.
 
<EOS>
Pdfr
has
writ
five
or
six
Grub
Street
papers
this
last
week
.
 
<EOS>
Have
you
seen
Toland
's
Invitation
to
Dismal
,
or
Hue
and
Cry
after
Dismal
,
or
Ballad
on
Dunkirk
,
or
Argument
that
Dunkirk
is
not
in
our
Hands
?
 
<EOS>
Poh
!
<EOS>
you
have
seen
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
dead
here
with
the
hot
weather
;
yet
I
walk
every
night
home
,
and
believe
it
does
me
good
:
<EOS>
but
my
shoulder
is
not
yet
right
;
itchings
,
and
scratchings
,
and
small
achings
.
 
<EOS>
Did
I
tell
you
I
had
made
Ford
Gazetteer
,
with
two
hundred
pounds
a
year
salary
,
beside
perquisites
?
 
<EOS>
I
had
a
letter
lately
from
Parvisol
,
who
says
my
canal
looks
very
finely
;
I
long
to
see
it
;
but
no
apples
;
all
blasted
again
.
 
<EOS>
He
tells
me
there
will
be
a
triennial
visitation
in
August
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
send
Raymond
another
proxy
.
 
<EOS>
So
now
I
will
answer
oo
rettle
N.33
,
dated
June
17
.
 
<EOS>
Ppt
writes
as
well
as
ever
,
for
all
her
waters
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
I
had
never
come
here
,
as
often
and
as
heartily
as
Ppt
.
 
<EOS>
What
had
I
to
do
here
?
 
<EOS>
I
have
heard
of
the
Bishop
's
making
me
uneasy
,
but
I
did
not
think
it
was
because
I
never
writ
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
A
little
would
make
me
write
to
him
,
but
I
do
n't
know
what
to
say
.
 
<EOS>
I
find
I
am
obliged
to
the
Provost
for
keeping
the
Bishop
from
being
impertinent
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
Maram
DD
,
but
oo
would
not
be
content
with
letters
flom
Pdfr
of
six
lines
,
or
twelve
either
,
fais
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
Ppt
will
have
done
with
the
waters
soon
,
and
find
benefit
by
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
,
if
they
were
as
far
off
as
Wexford
,
they
would
do
as
much
good
;
for
I
take
the
journey
to
contribute
as
much
as
anything
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
assure
you
the
Bishop
of
Clogher
's
being
here
does
not
in
the
least
affect
my
staying
or
going
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
talked
to
Higgins
but
once
in
my
life
in
the
street
,
and
I
believe
he
and
I
shall
hardly
meet
but
by
chance
.
 
<EOS>
What
care
I
whether
my
Letter
to
Lord
Treasurer
be
commended
there
or
no
?
 
<EOS>
Why
does
not
somebody
among
you
answer
it
,
as
three
or
four
have
done
here
?
 
<EOS>
(
I
am
now
sitting
with
nothing
but
my
nightgown
,
for
heat
.
)
 
<EOS>
Ppt
shall
have
a
great
Bible
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
put
it
down
in
my
memlandums
just
now
.
 
<EOS>
And
DD
shall
be
repaid
her
t'other
book
;
but
patience
,
all
in
good
time
:
 
<EOS>
you
are
so
hasty
,
a
dog
would
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
So
Ppt
has
neither
won
nor
lost
.
<EOS>
Why
,
mun
,
I
play
sometimes
too
at
picket
,
that
is
picquet
,
I
mean
;
but
very
seldom
.
 
<EOS>
Out
late
?
<EOS>
why
,
'
tis
only
at
Lady
Masham
's
,
and
that
is
in
our
town
;
but
I
never
come
late
here
from
London
,
except
once
in
rain
,
when
I
could
not
get
a
coach
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
had
very
little
thunder
here
;
none
these
two
months
.
<EOS>
Why
,
pray
,
madam
philosopher
,
how
did
the
rain
hinder
the
thunder
from
doing
any
harm
?
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
it
ssquenched
it
.
 
<EOS>
So
here
comes
Ppt

with
her
little
watery
postscript

I

<EOS>
You
hear
Secretary
St.
John
is
made
Viscount
Bullinbrook
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
hardly
persuade
him
to
take
that
title
,
because
the
eldest
branch
of
his
family
had
it
in
an
earldom
,
and
it
was
last
year
extinct
.
 
<EOS>
If
he
did
not
take
it
,
I
advised
him
to
be
Lord
Pomfret
,
which
I
think
is
a
noble
title
.
 
<EOS>
You
hear
of
it
often
in
the
Chronicles
,
Pomfret
Castle
:
 
<EOS>
but
we
believed
it
was
among
the
titles
of
some
other
lord
.
 
<EOS>
Jack
Hill
sent
his
sister
a
pattern
of
a
head
-
dress
from
Dunkirk
;
it
was
like
our
fashion
twenty
years
ago
,
only
not
quite
so
high
,
and
looked
very
ugly
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
made
Trapp
chaplain
to
Lord
Bullinbroke
,
and
he
is
mighty
happy
and
thankful
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Addison
returned
me
my
visit
this

<EOS>
He
lives

I

mighty

Pray

I
dined
yesterday
with
Lord
Treasurer

sat
with
him
till
ten
at
night
;
yet
could
not
find
a
minute
for
some
business
I
had
with
him
.
<EOS>
He
brought
me
to
Kensington
,
and
Lord
Bulingbrook
would
not
let
me
go
away
till
two
;
and
I
am
now
in

very
lazy

Grub
Street
has

ten
days
to

then
an
Act
of
Parliament
takes
place
that
ruins
it

by
taxing
every

at
a

We
have
news
just

not
the
particulars

that
the

,
at
the

of
eight
thousand
Dutch
,
is
beaten
,
lost
the
greatest
part
of
his
men
,
and
himself
a
prisoner
.

This
perhaps
may
cool
their
courage
,
and
make
them
think
of
a
peace

LETTER
51
.
 
<EOS>
LONDON
,
Aug.
7
,
1712
.
  
<EOS>
I
had
your
N.32
at
Windsor
:
 
<EOS>
I
just
read
it
,
and
immediately
sealed
it
up
again
,
and
shall
read
it
no
more
this
twelvemonth
at
least
.
 
<EOS>
The
reason
of
my
resentment
at
it
is
,
because
you
talk
as
glibly
of
a
thing
as
if
it
were
done
,
which
,
for
aught
I
know
,
is
farther
from
being
done
than
ever
,
since
I
hear
not
a
word
of
it
,
though
the
town
is
full
of
it
,
and
the
Court
always
giving
me
joy
and
vexation
.
 
<EOS>
You
might
be
sure
I
would
have
let
you
know
as
soon
as
it
was
done
;
but
I
believe
you
fancied
I
would
affect
not
to
tell
it
you
,
but
let
you
learn
it
from
newspapers
and
reports
.
 
<EOS>
I
remember
only
there
was
something
in
your
letter
about
ME
's
money
,
and
that
shall
be
taken
care
of
on
the
other
side
.
 
<EOS>
I
left
Windsor
on
Monday
last
,
upon
<EOS>
Lord
Bolingbroke
's
being
gone
to
France
,
and
somebody
's
being
here
that
I
ought
often
to
consult
with
in
an
affair
I
am
upon
:
 
but
<EOS>
that
person
talks
of
returning
to
Windsor
again
,
and
I
believe
I
shall
follow
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
now
in
a
hedge
-
lodging
very
busy
,
as
I
am
every
day
till
noon
<EOS>
:
 
<EOS>
so
that
this
letter
is
like
to
be
short
,
and
you
are
not
to
blame
me
these
two
months
;
for
I
protest
,
if
I
study
ever
so
hard
,
I
can
not
in
that
time
compass
what
I
am
upon
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
a
fever
both
here
and
at
Windsor
,
which
hardly
anybody
misses
;
but
it
lasts
not
above
three
or
four
days
,
and
kills
nobody
.
 
<EOS>
The
Queen
has
forty
servants
down
of
it
at
once
.
<EOS>
I
dined
yesterday
with
Treasurer
,
but
could
do
no
business
,
though
he
sent
for
me
,
I
thought
,
on
purpose
;
but
he
desires
I
will
dine
with
him
again
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
Windsor
is
a
most
delightful
place
,
and
at
this
time
abounds
in
dinners
.
 
<EOS>
My
lodgings
there
look
upon
Eton
and
the
Thames
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
I
was
owner
of
them
;
they
belong
to
a
prebend
.
 
<EOS>
God
knows
what
was
in
your
letter
;
and
if
it
be
not
answered
,
whose
fault
is
it
,
sauci
dallars
?
 
<EOS>
Do
you
know
that
Grub
Street
is
dead
and
gone
last
week
?
 
<EOS>
No
more
ghosts
or
murders
now
for
love
or
money
.
 
<EOS>
I
plied
it
pretty
close
the
last
fortnight
,
and
published
at
least
seven
penny
papers
of
my
own
,
besides
some
of
other
people
's
:
 
but
now
every
single
half
-
sheet
pays
a
halfpenny
to
the
Queen
.
 
<EOS>
The
Observator
is
fallen
;
the
Medleys
are
jumbled
together
with
the
Flying
Post
;
the
Examiner
is
deadly
sick
;
the
Spectator
keeps
up
,
and
doubles
its
price
;
I
know
not
how
long
it
will
hold
.
<EOS>
Have
you
seen
the
red
stamp
the
papers
are
marked
with
?
 
<EOS>
Methinks
it
is
worth
a
halfpenny
,
the
stamping

.

Lord
Bolingbroke
and
Prior
set
out

last
Saturday

My

the

Dutch
are
too
much
mauled

from

it

not

Dilly
is
just

he
used

puns
as
plentifully

such

If
you
have
not
your
letters
in
due
time
for
two
months
hence
,
impute
it
to
my
being
tosticated
between
this
and
Windsor
.
 
<EOS>
And
pray
send
me
again
the

of
ME
's

I
will
not
look
into
your

it

<EOS>
Poor
Lord
Winchelsea
is
dead
,
to
my
great
grief
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
a
worthy
honest
gentleman
,
and
particular
friend
of
mine
:
 
<EOS>
and
,
what
is
yet
worse
,
my
old
acquaintance
,
Mrs.
Finch
,
is
now
Countess
of
Winchelsea
,
the
title
being
fallen
to
her
husband
,
but
without
much
estate
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
poring
my
eyes
all
this
morning
,
and
it
is
now
past
two
afternoon
,
so
<EOS>
I
shall
take
a
little
walk
in
the
Park
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
play
at
ombre
still
?
 
<EOS>
Or
is
that
off
by
Mr.
Stoyte
's
absence
,
and
Mrs.
Manley
's
grief
?
<EOS>
Somebody
was
telling
me
of
a
strange
sister
that
Mrs.
Manley
has
got
in
Ireland
,
who
disappointed
you
all
about
her
being
handsome

LETTER
52
.
 
<EOS>
WINDSOR
,
Sept.
15
,
1712
.
  
<EOS>
I
never
was
so
long
without
writing
to
MD
as
now
,
since
I
left
them
,
nor
ever
will
again
while
I
am
able
to
write
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
expected
from
one
week
to
another
that
something
would
be
done
in
my
own
affairs
;
but
nothing
at
all
is
,
nor
I
do
n't
know
when
anything
will
,
or
whether
ever
at
all
,
so
slow
are
people
at
doing
favours
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
much
out
of
order
of
late
with
the
old
giddiness
in
my
head
.
 
<EOS>
I
took
a
vomit
for
it
two
days
ago
,
and
will
take
another
about
a
day
or
two
hence
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
eat
mighty
little
fruit
;
yet
I
impute
my
disorder
to
that
little
,
and
shall
henceforth
wholly
forbear
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
engaged
in
a
long
work
,
and
have
done
all
I
can
of
it
,
and
wait
for
some
papers
from
the
Ministry
for
materials
for
the
rest
;
and
they
delay
me
,
as
if
it
were
a
favour
I
asked
of
them
;
so
that
I
have
been
idle
here
this
good
while
,
and
it
happened
in
a
right
time
,
when
I
was
too
much
out
of
order
to
study
.
 
<EOS>
One
is
kept
constantly
out
of
humour
by
a
thousand
unaccountable
things
in
public
proceedings
;
and
when
I
reason
with
some
friends
,
we
can
not
conceive
how
affairs
can
last
as
they
are
.
 
<EOS>
God
only
knows
,
but
it
is
a
very
melancholy
subject
for
those
who
have
any
near
concern
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
again
endeavouring
,
as
I
was
last
year
,
to
keep
people
from
breaking
to
pieces
upon
a
hundred
misunderstandings
.
 
<EOS>
One
can
not
withhold
them
from
drawing
different
ways
,
while
the
enemy
is
watching
to
destroy
both
.
 
<EOS>
See
how
my
style
is
altered
,
by
living
and
thinking
and
talking
among
these
people
,
instead
of
my
canal
and
river
-
walk
and
willows
.
 
<EOS>
I
lose
all
my
money
here
among
the
ladies
;
so
that
I
never
play
when
I
can
help
it
,
being
sure
to
lose
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
lost
five
pounds
the
five
weeks
I
have
been
here
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
Ppt
is
luckier
at
picquet
with
the
Dean
and
Mrs.
Walls
.
 
<EOS>
The
Dean
never
answered
my
letter
,
though
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
clearly
forgot
whether
I
sent
a
bill
for
ME
in
any
of
my
last
letters
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
did
;
pray
let
me
know
,
and
always
give
me
timely
notice
.
 
<EOS>
I
wait
here
but
<EOS>
to
see
what
they
will
do
for
me
;
and
whenever
preferments
are
given
from
me
,
as
hope
saved
,
I
will
come
over
.
  
<EOS>

.
 
<EOS>
I
have
taken
a
vomit
to
-
day
,
and
hope
I
shall
be
better
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
very
giddy
since
I
writ
what
is
before
,
yet
not
as
I
used
to
be
:
 
more
frequent
,
but
not
so
violent
.
 
<EOS>
Yesterday
we
were
alarmed
with
the
Queen
's
being
ill
:
 
<EOS>
she
had
an
aguish
and
feverish
fit
;
and
you
never
saw
such
countenances
as
we
all
had
,
such
dismal
melancholy
.
 
<EOS>
Her
physicians
from
town
were
sent
for
,
but
towards
night
she
grew
better
;
to
-
day
she
missed
her
fit
,
and
was
up
:
 
<EOS>
we
are
not
now
in
any
fear
;
it
will
be
at
worst
but
an
ague
,
and
we
hope
even
that
will
not
return
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Treasurer
would
not
come
here
from
London
,
because
it
would
make
a
noise
if
he
came
before
his
usual
time
,
which
is
Saturday
,
and
he
goes
away
on
Mondays
.
 
<EOS>
The
Whigs
have
lost
a
great
support
in
the
Earl
of
Godolphin
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
a
good
jest
to
hear
the
Ministers
talk
of
him
now
with
humanity
and
pity
,
because
he
is
dead
,
and
can
do
them
no
more
hurt
.
 
<EOS>
Lady
Orkney
,
the
late
King
's
mistress
(
who
lives
at
a
fine
place
,
five
miles
from
hence
,
called
Cliffden
)
,
and
I
,
are
grown
mighty
acquaintance
.
 
<EOS>
She
is
the
wisest
woman
I
ever
saw
;
and
Lord
Treasurer
made
great
use
of
her
advice
in
the
late
change
of
affairs
.
 
<EOS>
I
heard
Lord
Marlborough
is
growing
ill
of
his
diabetes
;
which
,
if
it
be
true
,
may
soon
carry
him
off
;
and
then
the
Ministry
will
be
something
more
at
ease
.
 
<EOS>
MD
has
been
a
long
time
without
writing
to
Pdfr
,
though
they
have
not
the
same
cause
:
it
is
seven
weeks
since
your
last
came
to
my
hands
,
which
was
N.32
,
that
you
may
not
be
mistaken
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
Ppt
has
not
wanted
her
health
.
 
<EOS>
You
were
then
drinking
waters
.
 
<EOS>
The
doctor
tells
me
I
must
go
into
a
course
of
steel
,
though
I
have
not
the
spleen
;
for
that
they
can
never
give
me
,
though
I
have
as
much
provocation
to
it
as
any
man
alive
.
 
<EOS>
Bernage
's
regiment
is
broke
;
but
he
is
upon
half
-
pay
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
seen
him
this
long
time
;
but
I
suppose
he
is
overrun
with
melancholy
.
 
<EOS>
My
Lord
Shrewsbury
is
certainly
designed
to
be
Governor
of
Ireland
;
and
I
believe
the
Duchess
will
please
the
people
there
mightily
.
 
<EOS>
The
Irish
Whig
leaders
promise
great
things
to
themselves
from
his
government
;
but
care
shall
be
taken
,
if
possible
,
to
prevent
them
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Fenton
has
writ
to
me
that
she
has
been
forced
to
leave
Lady
Giffard
,
and
come
to
town
,
for
a
rheumatism
:
 
<EOS>
that
lady
does
not
love
to
be
troubled
with
sick
people
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Fenton
writes
to
me
as
one
dying
,
and
desires
I
would
think
of
her
son
:
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
answered
her
letter
.
 
<EOS>
She
is
retired
to
Mrs.
Povey
's
.
 
<EOS>
Is
my
aunt
alive
yet
?
<EOS>
and
do
you
ever
see
her
?
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
she
has
forgot
the
loss
of
her
son
.
 
<EOS>
Is
Raymond
's
new
house
quite
finished
?
<EOS>
and
does
he
squander
as
he
used
to
do
?
 
<EOS>
Has
he
yet
spent
all
his
wife
's
fortune
?
 
<EOS>
I
hear
there
are
five
or
six
people
putting
strongly
in
for
my
livings
;
God
help
them
!
 
<EOS>
But
if
ever
the
Court
should
give
me
anything
,
I
would
recommend
Raymond
to
the
Duke
of
Ormond
;
not
for
any
particular
friendship
to
him
,
but
because
it
would
be
proper
for
the
minister
of
Trim
to
have
Laracor
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
keep
the
gold
-
studded
snuff
-
box
now
;
for
my
brother
Hill
,
Governor
of
Dunkirk
,
has
sent
me
the
finest
that
ever
you
saw
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
allowed
at
Court
that
none
in
England
comes
near
it
,
though
it
did
not
cost
above
twenty
pounds
.
<EOS>
And
the
Duchess
of
Hamilton
has
made
me
pockets
for
[
it
]
like
a
woman
's
,
with
a
belt
and
buckle
(
for
,
you
know
,
I
wear
no
waistcoat
in
summer
)
,
and
there
are
several
divisions
,
and
one
on
purpose
for
my
box
,
<EOS>
oh
ho
!
 
<EOS>
We
have
had
most
delightful
weather
this
whole
week
;
but
illness
and
vomiting
have
hindered
me
from
sharing
in
a
great
part
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
Lady
Masham
made
the
Queen
send
to
Kensington
for
some
of
her
preserved
ginger
for
me
,
which
I
take
in
the
morning
,
and
hope
it
will
do
me
good
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Brent
sent
me
a
letter
by
a
young
fellow
,
a
printer
,
desiring
I
would
recommend
him
here
,
which
you
may
tell
her
I
have
done
:
 
<EOS>
but
I
can
not
promise
what
will
come
of
it
<EOS>
,
for
it
is
necessary
they
should
be
made
free
here
before
they
can
be
employed
.
 
<EOS>
I
remember
I
put
the
boy
prentice
to
Brent
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
Parvisol
has
set
my
tithes
well
this
year
:
 
<EOS>
he
has
writ
nothing
to
me
about
it
;
pray
talk
to
him
of
it
when
you
see
him
,
and
let
him
give
me
an
account
how
things
are
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
the
corn
is
now
off
the
ground
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
he
has
sold
that
great
ugly
horse
.
<EOS>
Why
do
n't
you
sell
to
him
?
 
<EOS>
He
keeps
me
at
charges
for
horses
that
I
never
ride
:
 
<EOS>
yours
is
lame
,
and
will
never
be
good
for
anything
.
 
<EOS>
The
Queen
will
stay
here
about
a
month
longer
,
I
suppose
;
but
Lady
Masham
will
go
in
ten
days
to
lie
in
at
Kensington
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
creature
,
she
fell
down
in
the
court
here
t'other
day
.
 
<EOS>
She
would
needs
walk
across
it
upon
some
displeasure
with
her
chairmen
,
and
was
likely
to
be
spoiled
so
near
her
time

but
we
hope
all
is
over
for
a
black
eye

a
sore
side

though
I
shall
not

I
find
I
can
fill

LETTER
53
.
 
<EOS>
LONDON
,
Oct.
9
,
1712
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
left
Windsor
these
ten
days
,
and
am
deep
in
pills
with
asafoetida
,
and
a
steel
bitter
drink
;
and
I
find
my
head
much
better
than
it
was
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
very
much
discouraged
;
for
I
used
to
be
ill
for
three
or
four
days
together
,
ready
to
totter
as
I
walked
.
 
<EOS>
I
take
eight
pills
a
day
,
and
have
taken
,
I
believe
,
a
hundred
and
fifty
already
.
 
<EOS>
The
Queen
,
Lord
Treasurer
,
Lady
Masham
,
and
I
,
were
all
ill
together
,
but
are
now
all
better
;
only
Lady
Masham
expects
every
day
to
lie
in
at
Kensington
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
never
such
a
lump
of
lies
spread
about
the
town
together
as
now
.
 
<EOS>
I
doubt
not
<EOS>
but
you
will
have
them
in
Dublin
before
this
comes
to
you
,
and
all
without
the
least
grounds
of
truth
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
mightily
put
backward
in
something
I
am
writing
by
my
illness
,
but
hope
to
fetch
it
up
,
so
as
to
be
ready
when
the
Parliament
meets
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Treasurer
has
had
an
ugly
fit
of
the
rheumatism
,
but
is
now
near
quite
well
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
playing
at
one
-
and
-
thirty
with
him
and
his
family
t'other
night
.
 
<EOS>
He
gave
us
all
twelvepence
apiece
to
begin
with
:
 
<EOS>
it
put
me
in
mind
of
Sir
William
Temple
.
<EOS>
I
asked
both
him
and
Lady
Masham
seriously
whether
the
Queen
were
at
all
inclined
to
a
dropsy
,
and
they
positively
assured
me
she
was
not
:
 
so
did
her
physician
Arbuthnot
,
who
always
attends
her
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
these
devils
have
spread
that
she
has
holes
in
her
legs
,
and
runs
at
her
navel
,
and
<EOS>
I
know
not
what
.
<EOS>
Arbuthnot
has
sent
me
from
Windsor
a
pretty
Discourse
upon
Lying
,
and
I
have
ordered
the
printer
to
come
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
a
proposal
for
publishing
a
curious
piece
,
called
The
Art
of
Political
Lying
,
in
two
volumes
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
And
then
there
is
an
abstract
of
the
first
volume
,
just
like
those
pamphlets
which
they
call
The
Works
of
the
Learned
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
get
it
when
it
comes
out
.
 
<EOS>
The
Queen
has
a
little
of
the
gout
in
one
of
her
hands
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
she
will
stay
a
month
still
at
Windsor
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Treasurer
showed
me
the
kindest
letter
from
her
in
the
world
,
by
which
I
picked
out
one
secret
,
that
there
will
be
soon
made
some
Knights
of
the
Garter
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
another
is
fallen
by
Lord
Godolphin
's
death
:
he
will
be
buried
in
a
day
or
two
at
Westminster
Abbey
.
 
<EOS>
I
saw
Tom
Leigh
in
town
once
.
 
<EOS>
The
Bishop
of
Clogher
has
taken
his
lodging
for
the
winter

they
are
all
well
.
 
<EOS>
I
hear
there
are
in
town
abundance
of
people
from
Ireland
;
<EOS>
half
a
dozen
bishops
at
least
.
<EOS>
The
poor
old
Bishop
of
London
,
at
past
fourscore
,
fell
down
backward
going
upstairs
,
and
I
think
broke
or
cracked
his
skull
;
yet
is
now
recovering
.
 
<EOS>
The
town
is
as
empty
as
at
midsummer
;
and
if
I
had
not
occasion
for
physic
,
I
would
be
at
Windsor
still
.
 
<EOS>
Did
I
tell
you
of
Lord
Rivers
's
will
?
 
<EOS>
He
has
left
legacies
to
about
twenty
paltry
old
whores
by
name
,
and
not
a
farthing
to
any
friend
,
dependent
,
or
relation
:
 
he
has
left
from
his
only
child
,
Lady
Barrymore
,
her
mother
's
estate
,
and
given
the
whole
to
his
heir
-
male
,
a
popish
priest
,
a
second
cousin
,
who
is
now
Earl
Rivers
,
and
whom
he
used
in
his
life
like
a
footman
.
 
<EOS>
After
him
it
goes
to
his
chief
wench
and
bastard
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Treasurer
and
Lord
Chamberlain
are
executors
of
this
hopeful
will
.
 
<EOS>
I
loved
the
man
,
and
detest
his
memory
.
 
<EOS>
We
hear
nothing
of
peace
yet
:
 
<EOS>
I
believe
verily
the
Dutch
are
so
wilful
,
because
they
are
told
the
Queen
can
not
live
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
poor
MD
's
letter
,
N.3
,
at
Windsor
:
 
<EOS>
but
I
could
not
answer
it
then
;
poor
Pdfr
was
vely
kick
then
:
 
and
,
besides
,
it
was
a
very
inconvenient
place
to
send
letters
from
.
 
<EOS>
Oo
thought
to
come
home
the
same
day
,
and
stayed
a
month
:
 
<EOS>
that
was
a
sign
<EOS>
the
place
was
agreeable
.
<EOS>
I
should
love
such
a
sort
of
jaunt
.
 
<EOS>
Is
that
lad
Swanton
a
little
more
fixed
than
he
used
to
be
?
 
<EOS>
I
think
you
like
the
girl
very
well
.
 
<EOS>
She
has
left
off
her
grave
airs
,
I
suppose
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
now
told
Lord
Godolphin
was
buried
last
night
.
 
<EOS>
O
poo
Ppt
!
<EOS>
lay
down
oo
head
aden

fais
I.
.

<EOS>
;
I
always
reckon
if
oo
are
ill
<EOS>
I
shall
hear
it
,
and
therefore
hen
oo
are
silent
<EOS>
I
reckon
all
is
well
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
I
"
scaped
the
new
fever
for
the
same
reason
that
Ppt
did
,
because
I
am
not
well
;
but
why
should
DD
"
scape
it
,
pray
?
 
<EOS>
She
is
melthigal
,
oo
know
,
and
ought
to
have
the
fever
;
but
I
hope
it
is
now
too
late
,
and
she
wo
n't
have
it
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
Some
physicians
here
talk
very
melancholy
,
and
think
it
foreruns
the
plague
,
which
is
actually
at
Hamburg
.
 
<EOS>
I
hoped
Ppt
would
have
done
with
her
illness
;
but
I
think
we
both
have
that
faculty
never
to
part
with
a
disorder
for
ever
;
we
are
very
constant
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
had
my
giddiness
twenty
-
three
years
by
fits
.
 
<EOS>
Will
Mrs.
Raymond
never
have
done
lying
-
in
?
 
<EOS>
He
intends
to
leave
beggars
enough
;
for
I
daresay
he
has
squandered
away
the
best
part
of
his
fortune
already
,
and
is
not
out
of
debt
.
<EOS>
I
had
a
letter
from
him
lately
.
  
<EOS>
Oct.
11
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Treasurer
sent
for
me
yesterday
and
the
day
before
to
sit
with
him
,
because
he
is
not
yet
quite
well
enough
to
go
abroad
;
and
I
could
not
finish
my
letter
.
 
<EOS>
How
the
deuce
come
I
to
be
so
exact
in
ME
money
?
 
<EOS>
Just
seventeen
shillings
and
eightpence
more
than
due
;
I
believe
you
cheat
me
.
 
<EOS>
If
Hawkshaw
does
not
pay
the
interest
I
will
have
the
principal
;
pray
speak
to
Parvisol
and
have
his
advice
what
I
should
do
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
Service
to
Mrs.
Stoyte

<EOS>
Ppt

a
petition
with
many
apologies
.
 
<EOS>
John
Danvers
,
you
know
,
is
Lady
Giffard
's
friend

<EOS>
The
rest
I
never
heard
of
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
you
what
,
as
things
are
at
present
,
I
can
not
possibly
speak
to
Lord
Treasurer
for
anybody
.
 
<EOS>
I
need
tell
you
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
Something
or
nothing
will
be
done
in
my
own
affairs
:
 
if
the
former
,
I
will
be
a
solicitor
for
your
sister
;
if
the
latter
,
I
have
done
with
Courts
for
ever
.
<EOS>
Opportunities
will
often
fall
in
my
way
,
if
I
am
used
well
,
and
I
will
then
make
it
my
business
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
my
delight
to
do
good
offices
for
people
who
want
and
deserve
,
and
a
tenfold
delight
to
do
it
to
a
relation
of
Ppt
,
whose
affairs
she
has
so
at
heart
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
taken
down
his
name
and
his
case
(
not
HER
case
)
,
and
whenever
a
proper
time
comes
,
I
will
do
all
I
can
;
zat
's
enough
to
say
when
I
can
do
no
more
;
and
I
beg
oo
pardon
a
sousand
times
,
that
I
can
not
do
better

<EOS>
I
hope
the
Dean
of
St.
P[atrick

well

<EOS>
I
am
glad
of

pray
do
n't

I

Have

It

Lord
Bolingbroke
has
been
idle
at

house
this

I

two

some

LETTER
54
.
 
<EOS>
LONDON
,
Oct.
28
,
1712
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
been
in
physic
this
month
,
and
have
been
better
these
three
weeks
.
 
<EOS>
I
stop
my
physic
,
by
the
doctor
's
orders
,
till
he
sends
me
further
directions
.
<EOS>
DD
grows
politician
,
and
longs
to
hear
the
peace
is
proclaimed
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
we
shall
have
it
soon
,
for
the
Dutch
are
fully
humbled
;
and
Prior
is
just
come
over
from
France
for
a
few
days
;
I
suppose
upon
some
important
affair
.
 
<EOS>
I
saw
him
last
night
,
but
had
no
private
talk
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
Stocks
rise
upon
his
coming
.
 
<EOS>
As
for
my
stay
in
England
,
it
can
not
be
long
now
,
so
tell
my
friends
.
<EOS>
The
Parliament
will
not
meet
till
after
Christmas
,
and
by
that
time
the
work
I
am
doing
will
be
over
,
and
then
nothing
shall
keep
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
very
much
discontented
at
Parvisol
,
about
neglecting
to
sell
my
horses
,
etc
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Masham
is
not
yet
brought
to
bed
;
but
we
expect
it
daily
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
with
her
to
-
day
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Bolingbroke
returned
about
two
months
ago
,
and
Prior
about
a
week
;
and
goes
back
(
Prior
I
mean
)
in
a
few
days
.
 
<EOS>
Who
told
you
of
my
snuff
-
box
and
pocket
?
 
<EOS>
Did
I
?
 
<EOS>
I
had
a
letter
to
-
day
from
Dr.
Coghill
,
desiring
me
to
get
Raphoe
for
Dean
Sterne
,
and
the
deanery
for
myself
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
indeed
,
I
have
such
obligations
to
Sterne
.
 
<EOS>
But
however
,
if
I
am
asked
who
will
make
a
good
bishop
,
I
shall
name
him
before
anybody
.
 
<EOS>
Then
comes
another
letter
,
desiring
I
would
recommend
a
Provost
,
supposing
that
Pratt
(
who
has
been
here
about
a
week
)
will
certainly
be
promoted
;
but
I
believe
he
will
not
.
 
<EOS>
I
presented
Pratt
to
Lord
Treasurer
,
and
truly
young
Molyneux
would
have
had
me
present
him
too
;
but
I
directly
answered
him
I
would
not
,
unless
he
had
business
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
the
son
of
one
Mr.
Molyneux
of
Ireland
.
 
<EOS>
His
father
wrote
a
book
;
I
suppose
you
know
it
.
 
<EOS>
Here
is
the
Duke
of
Marlborough
going
out
of
England
<EOS>
(
Lord
knows
why
)
,
which
causes
many
speculations
.
 
<EOS>
Some
say
he
is
conscious
of
guilt
,
and
dare
not
stand
it
.
 
<EOS>
Others
think
he
has
a
mind
to
fling
an
odium
on
the
Government
,
as
who
should
say
that
one
who
has
done
such
great
services
to
his
country
can
not
live
quietly
in
it
,
by
reason
of
the
malice
of
his
enemies
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
helped
to
patch
up
these
people
together
once
more
.
 
<EOS>
God
knows
how
long
it
may
last
.
<EOS>
I
was
to
-
day
at
a
trial
between
Lord
Lansdowne
and
Lord
Carteret
,
two
friends
of
mine
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
in
the
Queen
's
Bench
,
for
about
six
thousand
a
year
(
or
nine
,
I
think
)
.
 
<EOS>
I
sat
under
Lord
Chief
-
Justice
Parker
,
and
his
pen
falling
down
<EOS>
I
reached
it
up
.
 
<EOS>
He
made
me
a
low
bow
;
and
I
was
going
to
whisper
him
that
I
HAD
DONE
GOOD
FOR
EVIL
;
FOR
HE
WOULD
HAVE
TAKEN
MINE
FROM
ME
.
 
<EOS>
I
told
it
Lord
Treasurer
and
Bolingbroke
.
<EOS>
Parker
would
not
have
known
me
,
if
several
lords
on
the
bench
,
and
in
the
court
,
bowing
,
had
not
turned
everybody
's
eyes
,
and
set
them
a
whispering
.
 
<EOS>
I
owe
the
dog
a
spite
,
and
will
pay
him
in
two
months
at
furthest
,
if
I
can
.
 
<EOS>
So
much
for
that
.
 
<EOS>
But
you
must
have
chat
,
and
<EOS>
I
must
say
every
sorry
thing
that
comes
into
my
head
.
 
<EOS>
They
say
the
Queen
will
stay
a
month
longer
at
Windsor
.
<EOS>
These
devils
of
Grub
Street
rogues
,
that
write
the
Flying
Post
and
Medley
in
one
paper
,
will
not
be
quiet
.
 
<EOS>
They
are
always
mauling
Lord
Treasurer
,
Lord
Bolingbroke
,
and
me
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
the
dog
under
prosecution
,
but
Bolingbroke
is
not
active
enough
;
but
I
hope
to
swinge
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
a
Scotch
rogue
,
one
Ridpath
.
 
<EOS>
They
get
out
upon
bail
,
and
write
on
.
 
<EOS>
We
take
them
again
,
and
get
fresh
bail
;
so
it
goes
round
.
 
<EOS>
They
say
some
learned
Dutchman
has
wrote
a
book
,
proving
by
civil
law
that
we
do
them
wrong
by
this
peace
;
but
I
shall
show
by
plain
reason
that
we
have
suffered
the
wrong
,
and
not
they
.
 
<EOS>
I
toil
like
a
horse
,
and
have
hundreds
of
letters
still
to
read
and
squeeze
a
line
out
of
each
,
or
at
least
the
seeds
of
a
line
.
 
<EOS>
Strafford
goes
back
to
Holland
in
a
day
or
two
,
and
I
hope
our
peace
is
very
near
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
about
thirty
pages
more
to
write
(
that
is
,
to
be
extracted
)
,
which
will
be
sixty
in
print
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
the
most
troublesome
part
of
all
,
and
I
can
not
keep
myself
private
,
though
I
stole
into
a
room
up
two
pair
of
stairs
,
when
I
came
from
Windsor
;
but
my
present
man
has
not
yet
learned
his
lesson
of
denying
me
discreetly
.

<EOS>
The
Duchess
of
Ormond
found
me
out
to
-
day
,
and
made
me
dine
with
her
.
<EOS>
Lady
Masham
is
still
expecting
.
 
<EOS>
She
has
had
a
cruel
cold
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
finish
my
letter
last
post
for
the
soul
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Bolingbroke
has
had
my
papers
these
six
weeks
,
and
done
nothing
to
them
.
 
<EOS>
Is
Tisdall
yet
in
the
world
?
 
<EOS>
I
propose
writing
controversies
,
to
get
a
name
with
posterity
.
 
<EOS>
The
Duke
of
Ormond
will
not
be
over
these
three
or
four
days
.
 
<EOS>
I
desire
to
make
him
join
with
me
in
settling
all
right
among
our
people
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
ordered
the
Duchess
to
let
me
have
an
hour
with
the
Duke
at
his
first
coming
,
to
give
him
a
true
state
of
persons
and
things
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
the
Duke
of
Shrewsbury
will
hardly
be
declared
your
Governor
yet
;
at
least
,
I
think
so
now
;
but
resolutions
alter
very
often
.
 
<EOS>
The
Duke
of
Hamilton
gave
me
a
pound
of
snuff
to
-
day
,
admirable
good
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
DD
had
it
,
and
<EOS>
Ppt
too
,
if
she
likes
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
cost
me
a
quarter
of
an
hour
of
his
politics
,
which
I
was
forced
to
hear
.
 
<EOS>
Lady
Orkney
is
making
me
a
writing
-
table
of
her
own
contrivance
,
and
a
bed
nightgown
.
 
<EOS>
She
is
perfectly
kind
,
like
a
mother
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
the
devil
was
in
it
the
other
day
,
that
I
should
talk
to
her
of
an
ugly
squinting
cousin
of
hers
,
and
the
poor
lady
herself
,
you
know
,
squints
like
a
dragon
.
 
<EOS>
The
other
day
we
had
a
long
discourse
with
her
about
love
;
and
she
told
us
a
saying
of
her
sister
Fitz
-
Hardinge
,
which
I
thought
excellent
,
that
in
men
,
desire
begets
love
,
and
in
women
,
love
begets
desire
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
abundance
of
our
old
criers
still
hereabouts
.
 
<EOS>
I
hear
every
morning
your
women
with
the
old
satin
and
taffeta
,
etc
.
,
the
fellow
with
old
coats
,
suits
or
cloaks
.
 
<EOS>
Our
weather
is
abominable
of
late
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
not
two
tolerable
days
in
twenty
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
lost
money
again
at
ombre
,
with
Lord
Orkney
and
others
;
yet
,
after
all
,
this
year
I
have
lost
but
three
-
and
-
twenty
shillings
;
so
that
,
considering
card
money
,
I
am
no
loser
.
  
<EOS>
Our
Society
hath
not
yet
renewed
their
meetings
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
we
shall
continue
to
do
some
good
this
winter
;
and
Lord
Treasurer
promises
the
Academy
for
reforming
our
language
<EOS>
shall
soon
go
forward
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
now
go
hunt
those
dry
letter
 
for
materials
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
see
something
very
notable
,
I
hope
.
 
<EOS>
So
much
for
that

LETTER
55
.
 
<EOS>
LONDON
,
Nov.
15
,
1712
.
  
<EOS>
Before
this
comes
to
your
hands
,
you
will
have
heard
of
the
most
terrible
accident
that
hath
almost
ever
happened
.
 
<EOS>
This
morning
,
at
eight
,
my
man
brought
me
word
that
the
Duke
of
Hamilton
had
fought
with
Lord
Mohun
,
and
killed
him
,
and
was
brought
home
wounded
.
 
<EOS>
I
immediately
sent
him
to
the
Duke
's
house
,
in
St.
James
's
Square
;
but
the
porter
could
hardly
answer
for
tears
,
and
a
great
rabble
was
about
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
In
short
,
they
fought
at
seven
this
morning
.
 
<EOS>
The
dog
Mohun
was
killed
on
the
spot
;
and
while
the
Duke
was
over
him
,
Mohun
,
shortening
his
sword
,
stabbed
him
in
at
the
shoulder
to
the
heart
.
 
<EOS>
The
Duke
was
helped
toward
the
cake
-
house
by
the
Ring
in
Hyde
Park
(
where
they
fought
)
,
and
died
on
the
grass
,
before
he
could
reach
the
house
;
and
was
brought
home
in
his
coach
by
eight
,
while
the
poor
Duchess
was
asleep
.
 
<EOS>
Maccartney
,
and
one
Hamilton
,
were
the
seconds
,
who
fought
likewise
,
and
are
both
fled
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
told
that
a
footman
of
Lord
Mohun
's
stabbed
the
Duke
of
Hamilton
;
and
some
say
Maccartney
did
so
too
.
 
<EOS>
Mohun
gave
the
affront
,
and
yet
sent
the
challenge
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
infinitely
concerned
for
the
poor
Duke
,
who
was
a
frank
,
honest
,
good
-
natured
man
.
 
<EOS>
I
loved
him
very
well
,
and
I
think
he
loved
me
better
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
the
greatest
mind
in
the
world
to
have
me
go
with
him
to
France
,
but
durst
not
tell
it
me
;
and
those
he
did
,
said
I
could
not
be
spared
,
which
was
true
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
removed
the
poor
Duchess
to
a
lodging
in
the
neighbourhood
,
where
I
have
been
with
her
two
hours
,
and
am
just
come
away
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
saw
so
melancholy
a
scene
;
for
indeed
all
reasons
for
real
grief
belong
to
her
;
nor
is
it
possible
for
anybody
to
be
a
greater
loser
in
all
regards
.
 
<EOS>
She
has
moved
my
very
soul
.
 
<EOS>
The
lodging
was
inconvenient
,
and
they
would
have
removed
her
to
another
;
but
I
would
not
suffer
it
,
because
it
had
no
room
backward
,
and
she
must
have
been
tortured
with
the
noise
of
the
Grub
Street
screamers
mention[ing
]
her
husband
's
murder
to
her
ears
.
  
<EOS>
I
believe
you
have
heard
the
story
of
my
escape
,
in
opening
the
bandbox
sent
to
Lord
Treasurer
.
 
<EOS>
The
prints
have
told
a
thousand
lies
of
it
;
but
at
last
we
gave
them
a
true
account
of
it
at
length
,
printed
in
the
evening
;
only
I
would
not
suffer
them
to
name
me
,
having
been
so
often
named
before
,
and
teased
to
death
with
questions
.
 
<EOS>
I
wonder
how
I
came
to
have
so
much
presence
of
mind
,
which
is
usually
not
my
talent
;
but
so
it
pleased
God
,
and
I
saved
myself
and
him
;
for
there
was
a
bullet
apiece
.
 
<EOS>
A
gentleman
told
me
that
if
I
had
been
killed
,
the
Whigs
would
have
called
it
a
judgment
,
because
the
barrels
were
of
inkhorns
,
with
which
I
had
done
them
so
much
mischief
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
pure
Grub
Street
of
it
,
full
of
lies
and
inconsistencies
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
like
these
things
at
all
,
and
I
wish
myself
more
and
more
among
my
willows
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
a
devilish
spirit
among
people
,
and
the
Ministry
must
exert
themselves
,
or
sink
.
 
<EOS>
Nite
dee
sollahs
,
I
'll
go
seep
.
  
<EOS>
16
.
 
<EOS>
I
thought
to
have
finished
this
yesterday
;
but
was
too
much
disturbed
.
 
<EOS>
I
sent
a
letter
early
this
morning
to
Lady
Masham
,
to
beg
her
to
write
some
comforting
words
to
the
poor
Duchess
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
to-[day
]
<EOS>
with
Lady
Masham
at
Kensington
,
where
she
is
expecting
these
two
months
to
lie
in
.
 
<EOS>
She
has
promised
me
to
get
the
Queen
to
write
to
the
Duchess
kindly
on
this
occasion
;
and
to
-
morrow
I
will
beg
Lord
Treasurer
to
visit
and
comfort
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
with
her
two
hours
again
,
and
find
her
worse
:
 
her
violences
not
so
frequent
,
but
her
melancholy
more
formal
and
settled
.
 
<EOS>
She
has
abundance
of
wit
and
spirit
;
about
thirty
-
three
years
old
;
handsome
and
airy
,
and
seldom
spared
anybody
that
gave
her
the
least
provocation
;
by
which
she
had
many
enemies
and
few
friends
.
 
<EOS>
Lady
Orkney
,
her
sister
-
in
-
law
,
is
come
to
town
on
this
occasion
,
and
has
been
to
see
her
,
and
behaved
herself
with
great
humanity
.
<EOS>
They
have
been
always
very
ill
together
,
and
the
poor
Duchess
could
not
have
patience
when
people
told
her
I
went
often
to
Lady
Orkney
's
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
am
resolved
to
make
them
friends
;
for
the
Duchess
is
now
no
more
the
object
of
envy
,
and
must
learn
humility
from
the
severest
master
,
Affliction
.
 
<EOS>
I
design
to
make
the
Ministry
put
out
a
proclamation
<EOS>
(
if
it
can
be
found
proper
)
against
that
villain
Maccartney
.
 
<EOS>
What
shall
we
do
with
these
murderers
?
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
end
this
letter
to
-
night
,
and
there
is
no
occasion
;
for
I
can
not
send
it
till
Tuesday
,
and
the
crowner
's
inquest
on
the
Duke
's
body
is
to
be
to
-
morrow
,
and
<EOS>
I
shall
know
more
.
 
<EOS>
But
what
care
oo
for
all
this
?
 
<EOS>
Iss
,
poo
MD
<EOS>
i
m
<EOS>
sorry
for
poo

's
friends
;
and
this
is
a
very
surprising
event
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
late

and
I
'll
go
to
bed
.
 
<EOS>
This
looks

<EOS>
I
was
to
-
day
at
noon
with
the
Duchess
of
Hamilton
again
,
after
I
had
been
with
Lady
Orkney
,
and
charged
her
to
be
kind
to
her
sister
in
her
affliction
.
<EOS>
The
Duchess
told
me
Lady
Orkney
had
been
with
her
,
and
that
she
did
not
treat
her
as
gently
as
she
ought
.
 
<EOS>
They
hate
one
another
,
but
I
will
try
to
patch
it
up
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
drawing
up
a
paragraph
for
the
Postboy
,
to
be
out
to
-
morrow
,
and
as
malicious
as
possible
,
and
very
proper
for
Abel
Roper
,
the
printer
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
at
Lord
Treasurer
's
at
six
in
the
evening
,
which
is
his
usual
hour
of
returning
from
Windsor
:
 
<EOS>
he
promises
to
visit
the
Duchess
to
-
morrow
,
and
says
he
has
a
message
to
her
from
the
Queen
.
 
<EOS>
Thank
God
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
stayed
till
past
one
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
So

The
Committee
of
Council
is
to
sit
this
afternoon
upon
the
affair
of
the
Duke
of
Hamilton
's
murder
,
and
I
hope
a
proclamation
will
be
out
against
Maccartney
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
just
now
(
'
tis
now
noon
)
with
the
Duchess
,
to
let
her
know
Lord
Treasurer
will
see
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
is
mightily
out
of
order
.
 
<EOS>
The
jury
have
not
yet
brought
in
their
verdict
upon
the
crowner
's
inquest
.
<EOS>
We
suspect
Maccartney
stabbed
the
Duke
while
he
was
fighting
.
 
<EOS>
The
Queen
and
Lord
Treasurer
are
in
great
concern
at
this
event
.
 
<EOS>
I
dine
to
-
day
again
with
Lord
Treasurer
;
but
must
send
this
to
the
post
-
office
before
,
because
else
I
shall
not
have
time
;
he
usually
keeping
me
so
late
.
 
<EOS>
Ben
Tooke
bid
me
write
to
DD
to
send
her
certificate
,
for
it
is
high
time
it
should
be
sent
,
he
says
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
make
Parvisol
write
to
me
,
and
send
me
a
general
account
of
my
affairs
;
and
let
him
know
I
shall
be
over
in
spring
,
and
that
by
all
means
he
sells
the
horses
.
<EOS>
Prior
has
kissed
the
Queen
's
hand
,
and
will
return
to
France
in
a
few
days
,
and
Lord
Strafford
to
Holland
;
and
now
the
King
of
Spain
has
renounced
his
pretensions
to
France
,
the
peace
must
follow
very
soon
unavoidably
.
 
<EOS>
You
must
no
more
call
Philip
,
Duke
of
Anjou
,
for
we
now
acknowledge
him
King
of
Spain
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Pratt
tells
me
you
are
all
mad
in
Ireland
with
your
playhouse
frolics
and
prologues
,
and
I
know
not
what
.
 
<EOS>
The
Bishop
of
Clogher
and
family
are
well
<EOS>
:
they
have
heard
from
you
,
or
you
from
them
,
<EOS>
lately
,
I
have
forgot
<EOS>
which
:
 
<EOS>
I
dined
there
t'other
day
,
but
the
Bishop
came
not
till
after
dinner
;
and
our
meat
and
drink
was
very
so
so
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Vedeau
was
with
me
yesterday
,
and
inquired
after
you
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
a
lieutenant
,
and
is
now
broke
,
and
upon
half
-
pay
.
<EOS>
He
asked
me
nothing
for
himself
;
but
wanted
an
employment
for
a
friend
,
who
would
give
a
handsome
pair
of
gloves
.
 
<EOS>
One
Hales
sent
me
up
a
letter
t'other
day
,
which
said
you
lodged
in
his
house
,
and
therefore
desired
I
would
get
him
a
civil
employment
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
not
be
within
,
and
have
directed
my
man
to
give
him
an
answer
,
that
I
never
open
letters
brought
me
by
the
writers
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
complaining
to
a
lady
that
I
wanted
to
mend
an
employment
from
forty
to
sixty
pounds
a
year
,
in
the
Salt
Office
,
and
thought
it
hard
<EOS>
I
could
not
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
She
told
me
one
Mr.
Griffin
should
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
And
afterward
I
met
Griffin
at
her
lodgings
;
and
he
was
,
as
I
found
,
one
I
had
been
acquainted
with
.
 
<EOS>
I
named
Filby
to
him
,
and
his
abode
somewhere
near
Nantwich
.
 
<EOS>
He
said
frankly
he
had
formerly
examined
the
man
,
and
found
he
understood
very
little
of
his
business
;
but
if
he
heard
he
mended
,
he
would
do
what
I
desired
.
<EOS>
I
will
let
it
rest
a
while
,
and
then
resume
it
;
and
if
Ppt
writes
to
Filby
,
she
may
advise
him
to
diligence
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
I
told
Griffin
positively
I
would
have
it
done
,
if
the
man
mended
.

This
is

I

and
<EOS>
little

these
toads
of
Ministers
are
so
slow
in

for
meddling
in
other
people
's
affairs
:
 
<EOS>
I
have
enough
of
it
now
,
with
a
wanion
.
 
<EOS>
Two
women
have
been
here
six
times
apiece
;
I
never
saw
them
yet
.
<EOS>
The
first
I
have
despatched
with
a
letter
;
the
other
I
must
see
,
and
tell
her
I
can
do
nothing
for
her
:
 
<EOS>
she
is
wife
of
one
Connor
,
an
old
college
acquaintance
,
and
comes
on
a
foolish
errand
,
for
some
old
pretensions
,
that
will
succeed
when
I
am
Lord
Treasurer
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
got
[
up
]
two
pair
of
stairs
,
in
a
private
lodging
,
and
have
ordered
all
my
friends
not
to
discover
where
I
am
;
yet
every
morning
two
or
three
sots
are
plaguing
me
,
and
my
present
servant
has
not
yet
his
lesson
perfect
of
denying
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
written
a
hundred
and
thirty
pages
in
folio
,
to
be
printed
,
and
must
write
thirty
more
,
which
will
make
a
large
book
of
four
shillings
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
I
knew
an
opportunity
of
sending
you
some
snuff
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
watch
who
goes
to
Ireland
,
and
do
it
if
possible
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
a
letter
from
Parvisol
,
and
find
he
has
set
my
livings
very
low
.
 
<EOS>
Colonel
Hamilton
,
who
was
second
to
the
Duke
of
Hamilton
,
is
tried
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
he
is
come
off
,
but
have
not
heard
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
with
Lord
Treasurer
,
but
left
him
by
nine
,
and
visited
some
people
.
 
<EOS>
Lady
Betty
,
his
daughter
,
will
be
married
on
Monday
next
(
as
I
suppose
)
to
the
Marquis
of
Caermarthen
.
 
<EOS>
I
did
not
know
your
country
place
had
been
Portraine
,
till
you
told
me
so
in
your
last
.
 
<EOS>
Has
Swanton
taken
it
of
Wallis
?
 
<EOS>
That
Wallis
was
a
grave

wise
coxcomb

God
be
thanked
that

The
pamphlet
of
Political
Lying
is
written
by
Dr.
Arbuthnot
,
the
author
of
John
Bull
;
'
tis
very
pretty
,
but
not
so
obvious
to
be
understood
.
 
<EOS>
Higgins
,
first
chaplain
to
the
Duke
of
Hamilton
?
 
<EOS>
Why
,
the
Duke
of
Hamilton
never
dreamt
of
a
chaplain
,
nor
I
believe
ever
heard
of
Higgins
.

We

Swanton

Ay

now
I
see
Portraune

I
never

Now

<EOS>
So
,
you
read
one
of
the
Grub
Streets
about
the
bandbox
.
<EOS>
The
Whig
papers
have
abused
me
about
the
bandbox
.
 
<EOS>
God
help
me
,
what
could
I
do
?
 
<EOS>
I
fairly
ventured
my
life
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
a
particular
account
of
it
in
the
Postboy
,
and
Evening
Post
of
that
day
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Treasurer
has
had
the
seal
sent
him
that
sealed
the
box
,
and
directions
where
to
find
the
other
pistol
in
a
tree
in
St.
James
's
Park
,
which
Lord
Bolingbroke
's
messenger
found
accordingly
;
but
who
sent
the
present
is
not
yet
known
.
 
<EOS>
The
Duke
of
Hamilton
avoided
the
quarrel
as
much
as
possible
,
according
to
the
foppish
rules
of
honour
in
practice
.
 
<EOS>
What
signified
your
writing
angry
to
Filby

I

you
said

I
was
at

christening
on
Monday

<EOS>
I
could
not
get
the
child
named
Robin

after
Lord
Treasurer
;
it

Samuel

after

<EOS>
My

sent
me
some

I
wish
you
had
share
of
it
:
 
<EOS>
but
they

'
tis
good
for
me

and
I
design
to
drink
some
in
a
morning
.
 
<EOS>
Our
Society
meets
next
Thursday
,
now
the
Queen
is
in
town
;
and
Lord
Treasurer
assures
me
that
the
Society
for
reforming
the
language
shall
soon
be
established
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
given
away
ten
shillings

Hot
a
stir
is
here
about
your
company
and
visits
!
 
<EOS>
Charming
company
,
no
doubt
<EOS>
;
now
I
keep
no
company
at
all
,
nor
have
I
any
desire
to
keep
any
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
go
to
a
coffee
-
house
nor
a
tavern
,
nor
have
touched
a
card
since
I
left
Windsor
.
 
<EOS>
I
make
few
visits
,
nor
go
to
levees
;
my
only
debauching
is
sitting
late
where
I
dine
,
if
I
like
the
company
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
almost
dropped
the
Duchesses
of
Shrewsbury
and
Hamilton
,
and
several
others
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Treasurer
,
the
Duke
of
Ormond
,
and
Lady
Orkney
are
all
that
I
see
very
often
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
yes
,
and
Lady
Masham
and
Lord
Bolingbroke
,
and
one
or
two
private
friends
.
 
<EOS>
I
make
no
figure
but
at
Court
,
where
I
affect
to
turn
from
a
lord
to
the
meanest
of
my
acquaintance
,
and
I
love
to
go
there
on
Sundays
to
see
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
to
say
the
truth
,
I
am
growing
weary
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
dislike
a
million
of
things
in
the
course
of
public
affairs
;
and
if
I
were
to
stay
here
much
longer
,
I
am
sure
I
should
ruin
myself
with
endeavouring
to
mend
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
every
day
invited
into
schemes
of
doing
this
,
but
I
can
not
find
any
that
will
probably
succeed
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
impossible
to
save
people
against
their
own
will
;
and
I
have
been
too
much
engaged
in
patchwork
already
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
understand
all
this
stuff
?
 
<EOS>
No

<EOS>
Well

you
are
now
returned

I

It

I
have
not

this

to

him
;
he
is

a

Lady
Orkney
has
just
sent
to
invite
me
to
dinner

she
has
not

the

I

come
very
much
off

I

My

two

coals
in

I

<EOS>
Lord
Abercorn

will
plague

I
can

him
no

The
Duke
of
Shrewsbury
goes
in
a
day
or
two
for
France
,
perhaps
to
-
day

<EOS>
We
shall
have
a
peace
very
soon
;
the
Dutch
are
almost
entirely
agreed
,
and
if
they
stop
we
shall
make
it
without
them

that
has
been
long
resolved

<EOS>
One
Squire
Jones
,
a
scoundrel
in
my
parish

has
writ
to
me
to
desire
I
would
engage
Joe
Beaumont
to
give
him
his
interest
for
Parliament
-
man
for
Trim
:
 
pray
tell
Joe
this
;
and
if
he
designed
to
vote
for
him
already
,
then
he
may
tell
Jones
that
I
received
his
letter
,
and
that
I
writ
to
Joe
to
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
If
Joe
be
engaged
for
any
other
,
then
he
may
do
what
he
will
:
 
and
Parvisol
may
say
he
spoke
to
Joe
,
but
Joe
's
engaged
,
etc

I
received
three
pair
of
fine

stockings
from

lately

Our

was
to

to

day

but
Lord
Harley

who

which
the
Duke

was
soliciting
for
;
but
Abercorn
resolves
to
spoil
their
title
,
if
they
will
not
allow
him
a
fourth
part

I
have
advised
the
Duchess
to
compound
with

The

I

I

she

prude
that
she
will
not
let
so
much
as
her
picture
be
alone
in

all
my
mornings
are
lost
with
people
,
who
will
not
take
answers
below
stairs
;
such
as
Dilly
,
and
the
Bishop
,
and
Provost
,
etc

<EOS>
Lady
Orkney
invited
me
to
dinner
to
-
day
,
which
hindered
me
from
dining
with
Lord
Treasurer
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
his
day
that
his
chief
friends
in
the
Ministry
dine
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
I
went
there
about
six
,
and
sat
with
them
till
past
nine
,
when
they
all
went
off
;
but
he
kept
me
back
,
and
told
me
the
circumstances
of
Lady
Betty
's
match
.
 
<EOS>
The
young
fellow
has
60,000
pounds
ready
money
,
three
great
houses
furnished
,
7,000
pounds
a
year
at
present
,
and
about
five
more
after
his
father
and
mother
die
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
Lady
Betty
's
portion
is
not
above
8,000
pounds
.
 
<EOS>
I
remember
either
Tisdall
writ
to
me
in
somebody
's
letter
,
or
you
did
it
for
him
,
that
I
should
mention
him
on
occasion
to
Lord
Anglesea
,
with
whom
,
he
said
,
he
had
some
little
acquaintance
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Anglesea
was
with
me
to
-
night
at
Lord
Treasurer
's
;
and
then
I
asked
him
about
Tisdall
,
and
described
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
said
he
never
saw
him
,
but
that
he
had
sent
him
his
book
.
 
<EOS>
See
what
it
is
to
be
a
puppy
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
tell
Mr.
Walls
that
Lord
Anglesea
thanked
me
for
recommending
Clements
to
him
;
that
he
says
he
is
20,000
pounds
the
better
for
knowing
Clements
.
 
<EOS>
But
pray
do
n't
let
Clements
go
and
write
a
letter
of
thanks
,
and
tell
my
lord
that
he
hears
so
and
so
,
etc
.
<EOS>
Why
,
'
tis
but
like
an
Irish
understanding
to
do
so
.
 
<EOS>
Sad
weather
;
two
shillings
in
coaches
to
-
day
,
and
yet
I
am
dirty
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
now
going
to
read
over
something
and
correct
it
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
nite

<EOS>

.
 
<EOS>
Puppies
have
got
a
new
way
of
plaguing
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
find
letters
directed
for
me
at
Lord
Treasurer
's
,
sometimes
with
enclosed
ones
to
him
,
and
sometimes
with
projects
,
and
some
times
with
libels
.
 
<EOS>
I
usually
keep
them
three
or
four
days
without
opening
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
at
Court
to
-
day
,
as
I
always
am
on
Sundays
,
instead
of
a
coffee
-
house
,
to
see
my
acquaintance
.
 
<EOS>
This
day
se'nnight
,
after
I
had
been
talking
at
Court
with
Sir
William
Wyndham
,
the
Spanish
Ambassador
came
to
him
and
said
he
heard
that
was
Dr.
Swift
,
and
desired
him
to
tell
me
that
his
master
,
and
the
King
of
France
,
and
the
Queen
,
were
more
obliged
to
me
than
any
man
in
Europe
;
so
we
bowed
,
and
shook
hands
,
etc
.
<EOS>
I
took
it
very
well
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
with
Lord
Treasurer
,
and
must
again
to
-
morrow
,
though
I
had
rather
not
(
as
DD
says
)
;
but
now
the
Queen
is
in
town
,
he
does
not
keep
me
so
late
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
had
time
to
see
Fanny
Manley
since
she
came
,
but
intend
it
one
of
these
days
.
 
<EOS>
Her
uncle
,
Jack
Manley
,
I
hear
,
can
not
live
a
month
,
which
will
be
a
great
loss
to
her
father
in
Ireland
,
for
I
believe
he
is
one
of
his
chief
supports
.
 
<EOS>
Our
peace
now
will
soon
be
determined
;
for
Lord
Bolingbroke
tells
me
this
morning
that
four
provinces
of
Holland
have
complied
with
the
Queen
,
and
we
expect
the
rest
will
do
so
immediately
.
 
<EOS>

<EOS>
Lord
Keeper
promised
me
yesterday
the
first
convenient
living
to
poor
Mr.
Gery
,
who
is
married
,
and
wants
some
addition
to
what
he
has
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
a
very
worthy
creature
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
a
letter
some
weeks
ago
from
Elwick
,
who
married
Betty
Gery
.
 
<EOS>
It
seems
the
poor
woman
died
some
time
last
summer
.
 
<EOS>
Elwick
grows
rich
,
and
purchases
lands
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
with
Lord
Treasurer
to
-
day
,
who
has
engaged
me
to
come
again
to
-
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
I
gave
Lord
Bolingbroke
a
poem
of
Parnell
's
.
 
<EOS>
I
made
Parnell
insert
some
compliments
in
it
to
his
lordship
.
<EOS>
He
is
extremely
pleased
with
it
,
and
read
some
parts
of
it
to
-
day
to
Lord
Treasurer
,
who
liked
it
as
much
.
 
<EOS>
And
indeed
he
outdoes
all
our
poets
here
a
bar
's
length
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Bolingbroke
has
ordered
me
to
bring
him
to
dinner
on
Christmas
Day
,
and
I
made
Lord
Treasurer
promise
to
see
him
;
and
it
may
one
day
do
Parnell
a
kindness
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
Parnell
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
I
have
told
you
of
that
poem
.

Nite

<EOS>
This
morning
I
presented
one
Diaper
,
a
poet
,
to
Lord
Bolingbroke
,
with
a
new
poem
,
which
is
a
very
good
one
;
and
I
am
to
give
him
a
sum
of
money
from
my
lord
;
and
I
have
contrived
to
make
a
parson
of
him
,
for
he
is
half
one
already
,
being
in
deacon
's
orders
,
and
serves
a
small
cure
in
the
country
;
but
has
a
sword
at
his
a
#
#
#
#
here
in
town
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
a
poor
little
short
wretch
,
but
will
do
best
in
a
gown
,
and
we
will
make
Lord
Keeper
give
him
a
living
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Bolingbroke
writ
to
Lord
Treasurer
to
excuse
me
to
-
day
;
so
I
dined
with
the
former
,
and
Monteleon
,
the
Spanish
Ambassador
,
who
made
me
many
compliments
.
<EOS>
I
stayed
till
nine
,
and
now
it
is
past
ten
,
and
my
man
has
locked
me
up
,
and
I
have
just
called
to
mind
that
I
shall
be
in
disgrace
with
Tom
Leigh
.
 
<EOS>
That
coxcomb
had
got
into
acquaintance
with
one
Eckershall
,
Clerk
of
the
Kitchen
to
the
Queen
,
who
was
civil
to
him
at
Windsor
on
my
account
;
for
I
had
done
some
service
to
Eckershall
.
 
<EOS>
Leigh
teases
me
to
pass
an
evening
at
his
lodgings
with
Eckershall
.
 
<EOS>
I
put
it
off
several
times
,
but
was
forced
at
last
to
promise
I
would
come
to
-
night
;
and
it
never
was
in
my
head
till
I
was
locked
up
,
and
I
have
called
and
called
,
but
my
man
is
gone
to
bed
;
so
I
will
write
an
excuse
to
-
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
I
detest
that
Tom
Leigh
,
and
am
as
formal
to
him
as
I
can
when
I
happen
to
meet
him
in
the
Park
.
 
<EOS>
The
rogue
frets
me
,
if
he
knew
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
asked
me
why
I
did
not
wait
on
the
Bishop
of
Dromore
.
 
<EOS>
I
answered
I
had
not
the
honour
to
be
acquainted
with
him
,
and
would
not
presume
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
He
takes
me
seriously
,
and
says
the
Bishop
is
no
proud
man
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
He
tells
me
of
a
judge
in
Ireland
that
has
done
ill
things
.
 
<EOS>
I
ask
why
he
is
not
out
?
 
<EOS>
Says
he
,
"
I
think
the
bishops
,
and
you
,
and
I
,
and
the
rest
of
the
clergy
,
should
meet
and
consult
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
beg
his
pardon
,
and
say
,
"
I
can
not
be
serviceable
that
way
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
He
answers
,
"
Yes
,
everybody
may
help
something
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
see
how
curiously
he
contrives
to
vex
me
;
for
the
dog
knows
that
with
half
a
word
I
could
do
more
than
all
of
them
together
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
only
does
it
from
the
pride
and
envy
of
his
own
heart
,
and
not
out
of
a
humorous
design
of
teasing
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
one
of
those
that
would
rather
a
service
should
not
be
done
,
than
done
by
a
private
man
,
and
of
his
own
country
.
 
<EOS>
You
take
all
this
,
do
n't
you
?

I
dined
to
-
day
with
the
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
,
in
order
to
look
over
some
of
my
papers
;
but
nothing
was
done
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
also
mediating
between
the
Hamilton
family
and
Lord
Abercorn
,
to
have
them
compound
with
him
;
and
I
believe
they
will
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Selkirk
,
the
late
Duke
's
brother
,
is
to
be
in
town
,
in
order
to
go
to
France
,
to
make
the
demands
;
and
the
Ministry
are
of
opinion
they
will
get
some
satisfaction
,
and
they
empowered
me
to
advise
the
Hamilton
side
to
agree
with
Abercorn
,
who
asks
a
fourth
part
,
and
will
go
to
France
and
spoil
all
if
they
wo
n't

<EOS>
I
carried
Parnell
to
dine
at
Lord
Bolingbroke
's
,
and
he
behaved
himself
very
well
;
and
Lord
Bolingbroke
is
mightily
pleased
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
at
St.
James
's
Chapel
by
eight
this
morning
;
and
church
and
sacrament
were
done
by
ten
.
 
<EOS>
The
Queen
has
the
gout
in
her
hand
,
and
did
not
come
to
church
today
;
and
I
stayed
so
long
in
my
chamber
that
I
missed
going
to
Court
.
 
<EOS>
Did
I
tell
you
that
the
Queen
designs
to
have
a
Drawing

room
and
company
every
day
?
 
<EOS>

<EOS>
I
was
to
wish
the
Duke
of
Ormond
a
happy
Christmas
,
and
give
half
a
crown
to
his
porter
.
 
<EOS>
It
will
cost
me
a
dozen
half
-
crowns
among
such
fellows
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
with
Lord
Treasurer
,
who
chid
me
for
being
absent
three
days
.
 
<EOS>
Mighty
kind
,
with
a
p

;
less
of
civility
,
and
more
of
his
interest
!
 
<EOS>
We
hear
Maccartney
is
gone
over
to
Ireland
.
 
<EOS>
Was
it
not
comical
for
a
gentleman
to
be
set
upon
by
highwaymen
,
and
to
tell
them
he
was
Maccartney
?
 
<EOS>
Upon
which
they
brought
him
to
a
justice
of
peace
,
in
hopes
of
the
reward
,
and
the
rogues
were
sent
to
gaol
.
 
<EOS>
Was
it
not
great
presence
of
mind
?
 
<EOS>
But
maybe
you
heard
this
already
;
for
there
was
a
Grub
Street
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Bolingbroke
told
me
I
must
walk
away
to
-
day
when
dinner
was
done
,
because
Lord
Treasurer
,
and
he
,
and
another
,
were
to
enter
upon
business
;
but
I
said
it
was
as
fit
<EOS>
I
should
know
their
business
as
anybody
,
for
I
was
to
justify
[
it
]
.
 
<EOS>
So
the
rest
went
,
and
I
stayed
,
and
it
was
so
important
<EOS>
,
I
was
like
to
sleep
over
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
left
them
at
nine

and
it
is
now

dined

General

,
Governor
of
Dunkirk
.
 
<EOS>
Lady
Masham
and
Mrs.
Hill
,
his
two
sisters
,
were
of
the
company
,
and
there
have
I
been
sitting
this
evening
till
eleven
,
looking
over
others
at
play
;
for
I
have
left
off
loving
play
myself
;
and
I
think
Ppt
is
now
a
great
gamester
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
great
cold
on
me
,
not
quite
at
its
height
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
them
seldom
,
and
therefore
ought
to
be
patient
.
 
<EOS>
I
met
Mr.
Addison
and
Pastoral
Philips
on
the
Mall
to
-
day
,
and
took
a
turn
with
them
;
but
they
both
looked
terrible
dry
and
cold
.
 
<EOS>
A
curse
of
party
!
 
<EOS>
And
do
you
know
I
have
taken
more
pains
to
recommend
the
Whig
wits
to
the
favour
and
mercy
of
the
Ministers
than
any
other
people

<EOS>
Steele
I
have
kept
in
his
place

<EOS>
Congreve
<EOS>
I
have
got
to
be
used

secured

<EOS>
Rowe
I
have
recommended

got
a
promise
of
a
place

<EOS>
Philips
I
could
certainly
have
provided
for
,
if
he
had
not
run
party
mad
,
and
made
me
withdraw
my
recommendation
;
and
I
set
Addison
so
right
at
first
that
he
might
have
been
employed
,
and
have
partly
secured
him
the
place
he
has
;
yet
I
am
worse
used
by
that
faction
than
any
man
.
 
<EOS>
Well

go

My
cold
is
so
bad
that
I
could
not
go
to
church
today
,
nor
to
Court
;
but
I
was
engaged
to
Lord
Orkney
's
with
the
Duke
of
Ormond
,
at
dinner
;
and
ventured
,
because
I
could
cough
and
spit
there
as
I
pleased
.
 
<EOS>
The
Duke
and
Lord
Arran
left
us
,
and
I
have
been
sitting
ever
since
with
Lord
and
Lady
Orkney
till
past
eleven

and
my
cold
is
worse
,
and
makes
me
giddy

<EOS>
I
hope
it
is
only
my
cold
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
says
Ppt
,
everybody
is
giddy
with
a
cold
;
I
hope
it
is
no
more

but
I
'll
go
to
bed

for
the

has
bawled

Past

<EOS>
I
got
out
early
to

day
,
and
escaped
all
my
duns
.
 
<EOS>
I
went
to
see
Lord
Bolingbroke
about
some
business
,
and
truly
he
was
gone
out
too
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
in
the
City
upon
the
broiled
leg
of
a
goose
and
a
bit
of
brawn

I

something

me

I

at

I
will
not
embitter
worse
those
I

already

till
I
have

under

and
the

know
my

so
that
you
may
be
disappointed
in
seeing
this

expected

Duke
of
Ormond
,
Lord
Arran
,
and
I
,
dined
privately
to
-
day
at
an
old
servant
's
house
of
his
.
 
<EOS>
The
Council
made
us
part
at
six
.
 
<EOS>
One
Mrs.
Ramsay
dined
with
us
;
an
old
lady
of
about
fifty
-
five
,
that
we
are
all
very
fond
of
.
 
<EOS>
I
called
this
evening
at
Lord
Treasurer
's
,
and
sat
with
him
two
hours
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
been
cupped
for
a
cold
,
and
has
been
very
ill
.
 
<EOS>
He
can
not
dine
with
Parnell
and
me
at
Lord
Bolingbroke
's
to

morrow
,
but
says
he
will
see
Parnell
some
other
time
.
 
<EOS>
I
hoise
up
Parnell
partly
to
spite
the
envious
Irish
folks
here
,
particularly
Tom
Leigh
.
 
<EOS>
I
saw
the
Bishop
of
Clogher
's
family
to

;
Miss

mighty

of
a

coughs

<EOS>
To

day
<EOS>
Parnell
and
I
dined
with
Lord
Bolingbroke
,
to
correct
Parnell
's
poem
.
 
<EOS>
I
made
him
show
all
the
places
he
disliked
;
and
when
Parnell
has
corrected
it
fully
he
shall
print
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
went
this
evening
to
sit
with
Lord
Treasurer
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
better
,
and
will
be
out
in
a
day
or
two
.
 
<EOS>
I
sat
with
him
while
the
young
folks
went
to
supper
;
and
then
went
down
,
and
there
were
the
young
folks
merry
together
,
having
turned
Lady
Oxford
up
to
my
lord
,
and
I
stayed
with
them
till
twelve
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
the
young
couple
,
Lord
and
Lady
Caermarthen
,
and
Lord
and
Lady
Dupplin
,
and
Lord
Harley
and
I
;
and
the
old
folks
were
together
above
.
 
<EOS>
It
looked
like
what
I
have
formerly
done
so
often
;
stealing
together
from
the
old
folks
,
though
indeed
it
was
not
from
poor
Lord
Treasurer
,
who
is
as
young
a
fellow
as
any
of
us
:
 
but
<EOS>
Lady
Oxford
is
a
silly
mere
old
woman
.

My

is
still
so

I

I
forgot
to
tell
you
that
yesterday
Lord
Abercorn
was
here
,
teasing
me
about
his
French
duchy
,
and
suspecting
my
partiality
to
the
Hamilton
family
in
such
a
whimsical
manner
that
Dr.
Pratt
,
who
was
by
,
thought
he
was
mad
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
no
sooner
gone
<EOS>
but
Lord
Orkney
sent
to
know
whether
he
might
come
and
sit
with
me
half
an
hour
upon
some
business
.
 
<EOS>
I
returned
answer
that
I
would
wait
on
him
;
which
I
did
.
<EOS>
We
discoursed
a
while
,
and
he
left
me
with
Lady
Orkney
;
and
in
came
the
Earl
of
Selkirk
,
whom
I
had
never
seen
before
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
another
brother
of
the
Duke
of
Hamilton
,
and
is
going
to
France
,
by
a
power
from
his
mother
,
the
old
Duchess
,
to
negotiate
their
pretensions
to
the
duchy
of
Chatelherault
.
 
<EOS>
He
teased
me
for
two
hours
in
spite
of
my
teeth
,
and
held
my
hand
when
I
offered
to
stir
;
would
have
had
me
engage
the
Ministry
to
favour
him
against
Lord
Abercorn
,
and
to
convince
them
that
Lord
Abercorn
had
no
pretensions
;
and
desired
I
would
also
convince
Lord
Abercorn
himself
so
;
and
concluded
he
was
sorry
I
was
a
greater
friend
to
Abercorn
than
Hamilton
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
no
patience
,
and
used
him
with
some
plainness
.
 
<EOS>
Am
not
I
purely
handled
between
a
couple
of
puppies
?
 
<EOS>
Ay
,
says
Ppt
,
you
must
be
meddling
in
other
folks
'
affairs
.
 
<EOS>
I
appeal
to
the
Bishop
of
Clogher
whether
Abercorn
did
not
complain
that
I
would
not
let
him
see
me
last
year
,
and
that
he
swore
he
would
take
no
denial
from
my
servant
when
he
came
again
.
 
<EOS>
The
Ministers
gave
me
leave
to
tell
the
Hamilton
family
it
was
their
opinion
that
they
ought
to
agree
with
Abercorn
.
<EOS>
Lord
Anglesea
was
then
by
,
and
told
Abercorn
;
upon
which
he
gravely
tells
me
I
was
commissioned
by
the
Ministers
,
and
ought
to
perform
my
commission
,
etc
.
  
<EOS>
But
I
'll
have
done
with
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
warned
Lord
Treasurer
and
Lord
Bolingbroke
to
beware
of
Selkirk
's
teasing
,
;
  
x
 
on
him
!
 
<EOS>
Yet
Abercorn
vexes
me
more
.
 
<EOS>
The
whelp
owes
to
me
all
the
kind
receptions
he
has
had
from
the
Ministry
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
to

day
at
Lord
Treasurer
's
with
the
young
folks
,
and
sat
with
Lord
Treasurer
till
nine
,
and
then
was
forced
to
Lady
Masham
's
,
and
sat
there
till
twelve
,
talking
of
affairs
,
till
I
am
out
of
humour
,
as
everyone
must
that
knows
them
inwardly

<EOS>
A

things
wrong

most
of
them
easy
to
mend

yet
our
schemes
availing
at

little

nothing

I
twice
patched
up

all

is

to

burdening

LONDON

<EOS>
I
ended
my
last
with
the
melancholy
news
of
poor
Lady
Ashburnham
's
death
.
 
<EOS>
The
Bishop
of
Clogher
and
Dr.
Pratt
made
me
dine
with
them
to
-
day
at
Lord
Mountjoy
's
,
pursuant
to
an
engagement
,
which
I
had
forgot
.
 
<EOS>
Lady
Mountjoy
told
me
that
Maccartney
was
got
safe
out
of
our
clutches
,
for
she
had
spoke
with
one
who
had
a
letter
from
him
from
Holland
.
 
<EOS>
Others
say
the
same
thing
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
hard
such
a
dog
should
escape

<EOS>
As
I
left
Lord
Mountjoy

<EOS>
I
saw
the
Duke
d"Aumont
,
the
French
Ambassador
,
going
from
Lord
Bolingbroke
's
,
where
he
dined
,
to
have
a
private
audience
of
the
Queen
.
 
<EOS>
I
followed
,
and
went
up
to
Court
,
where
there
was
a
great
crowd
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
talking
with
the
Duke
of
Argyle
by
the
fireside
in
the
bed
-
chamber
,
when
the
Ambassador
came
out
from
the
Queen
.
 
<EOS>
Argyle
presented
me
to
him
,
and
Lord
Bolingbroke
<EOS>
and
we
talked
together
a
while
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
a
fine
gentleman
,
something
like
the
Duke
of
Ormond
,
and
just
such
an
expensive
man
.
 
<EOS>
After
church

day
I
showed

Bishop
of
Clogher
,
at

Lord

and
went
out
this
evening
to
the
Queen
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
with
Lady
Oxford
,
and
then
sat
with
Lord
Treasurer
while
he
went
out
.
 
<EOS>
He
gave
me
a
letter
from
an
unknown
hand
,
relating
to
Dr.
Brown
,
Bishop
of
Cork
,
recommending
him
to
a
better
bishopric
,
as
a
person
who
opposed
Lord
Wharton
,
and
was
made
a
bishop
on
that
account
,
celebrating
him
for
a
great
politician
,
etc
.
<EOS>
:
 
in
short
,
<EOS>
all
directly
contrary
to
his
character
,
which
I
made
bold
to
explain
.
 
<EOS>
What
dogs
there
are
in
the
world
!
 
<EOS>
I
was
to
see
the
poor
Duke
and
Duchess
of
Ormond
this
morning
.
 
<EOS>
The
Duke
was
in
his
public
room
,
with
Mr.
Southwell
and
two
more
gentlemen
.
 
<EOS>
When
Southwell
and
I
were
alone
with
him
,
he
talked
something
of
Lord
Ashburnham
,
that
he
was
afraid
the
Whigs
would
get
him
again
.
 
<EOS>
He
bore
up
as
well
as
he
could
,
but
<EOS>
something
falling
accidentally
in
discourse
,
the
tears
were
just
falling
out
of
his
eyes
,
and
I
looked
off
to
give
him
an
opportunity
(
which
he
took
)
of
wiping
them
with
his
handkerchief
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
saw
anything
so
moving
,
nor
such
a
mixture
of
greatness
of
mind
,
and
tenderness
,
and
discretion
.

Lord
Bolingbroke

and
<EOS>
I
dined
,
by
invitation
,
with
my
friend
Darteneuf
,
whom
you
have
heard
me
talk
of
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Bolingbroke
likes
Parnell
mightily
;
and
it
is
pleasant
to
see
that
one
who
hardly
passed
for
anything
in
Ireland
makes
his
way
here
with
a
little
friendly
forwarding
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
scurvy
rainy
weather
,
and
I
have
hardly
been
abroad
to

day
,
nor
know
anything
that
passes
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Treasurer
is
quite
recovered
,
and
I
hope
will
be
careful
to
keep
himself
well
.
 
<EOS>
The
Duchess
of
Marlborough
is
leaving
England
to
go
to
her
Duke
,
and
makes
presents
of
rings
to
several
friends
,
they
say
worth
two
hundred
pounds
apiece
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
sure
she
ought
to
give
me
one
,
though
the
Duke
pretended
to
think
me
his
greatest
enemy
,
and
got
people
to
tell
me
so
,
and
very
mildly
to
let
me
know
how
gladly
he
would
have
me
softened
toward
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
bid
a
lady
of
his
acquaintance
and
mine
<EOS>
let
him
know
that
I
had
hindered
many
a
bitter
thing
against
him
;
not
for
his
own
sake
,
but
because
I
thought
it
looked
base

I
desired
everything
should
be
left
him
,
except
power

<EOS>
I
dined
with
Lord
and
Lady
Masham
to
-
day
,
and
this
evening
played
at
ombre
with
Mrs.
Vanhom
,
merely
for
amusement
.
 
<EOS>
The
Ministers
have
got
my
papers
,
and
will
neither
read
them
nor
give
them
to
me
;
and
I
can
hardly
do
anything
.
<EOS>
Very
warm
slabby
weather
,
but
I
made
a
shift
to
get
a
walk
;
yet
I
lost
half
of
it
,
by
shaking
off
Lord
Rochester
,
who
is
a
good
,
civil
,
simple
man
.
 
<EOS>
The
Bishop
of
Ossory
will
not
be
Bishop
of
Hereford
,
to
the
great
grief
of
himself
and
his
wife
.
 
<EOS>
And
hat
is
MD
doing
now
<EOS>
,
I
wonder
?
 
<EOS>
Playing
at
cards
with
the
Dean
and
Mrs.
Walls
?
 
<EOS>
I
think
it
is
not
certain
yet
that
Maccartney
is
escaped
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
plagued
with
bad
authors
,
verse
and
prose
,
who
send
me
their
books
and
poems
,
the
vilest
trash
I
ever
saw
;
but
I
have
given
their
names
to
my
man
,
never
to
let
them
see
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
got
new
ink
,
and
'
tis
very
white
;
and
I
do
n't
see
that
it
turns
black
at
all
.

I
'll
go
to

<EOS>
Oo
must
understand
that
I
am
in
my
geers
,
and
have
got
a
chocolate
-
pot
,
a
present
from
Mrs.
Ashe
of
Clogher
,
and
some
chocolate
from
my
brother
Ormond
,
and
I
treat
folks
sometimes
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
with
Lord
Treasurer
at
five
o'clock
to
-
day
,
and
was
by
while
he
and
Lord
Bolingbroke
were
at
business
;
for
it
is
fit
<EOS>
I
should
know
all
that
passes
now
,
because
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
The
Duke
of
Ormond
employed
me
to
speak
to
Lord
Treasurer
to
-
day
about
an
affair
,
and
I
did
so
;
and
the
Duke
had
spoke
himself
two
hours
before
,
which
vexed
me
,
and
I
will
chide
the
Duke
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
tell
you
a
good
thing
;
there
is
not
one
of
the
Ministry
but
what
will
employ
me
as
gravely
to
speak
for
them
to
Lord
Treasurer
as
if
I
were
their
brother
or
his
;
and
I
do
it
as
gravely
:
 
<EOS>
though
I
know
they
do
it
only
because
they
will
not
make
themselves
uneasy
,
or
had
rather
I
should
be
denied
than
they
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
our
peace
will
not
be
finished
these
two
months
;
for
I
think
we
must
have
a
return
from
Spain
by
a
messenger
,
who
will
not
go
till
Sunday
next
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Treasurer
has
invited
me
to
dine
with
him
again
to

morrow

Dr.
Pratt
drank
chocolate
with
me
this
morning
,
and
then
we
walked
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
yesterday
with
him
to
see
Lady
Betty
Butler
,
grieving
for
her
sister
Ashburnham
.
 
<EOS>
The
jade
was
in
bed
in
form
,
and
she
did
so
ca
nt
,
she
made
me
sick
.
 
<EOS>
I
meet
Tom
Leigh
every
day
in
the
Park
,
to
preserve
his
health
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
as
ruddy
as
a
rose
,
and
tells
me
his
Bishop
of
Dromore
recovers
very
much
.
<EOS>
That
Bishop
has
been
very
near
dying
.
 
<EOS>
This
day
's
Examiner
talks
of
the
play
of
"
What
is
it
like
?
"
<EOS>
and
you
will
think
it
to
be
mine
,
and
be
bit
;
for
I
have
no
hand
in
these
papers
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
with
Lord
Treasurer
,
and
shall
again
to
-
morrow
,
which
is
his
day
when
all
the
Ministers
dine
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
calls
it
whipping
-
day
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
always
on
Saturday
,
and
we
do
indeed
usually
rally
him
about
his
faults
on
that
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
of
the
original
Club
,
when
only
poor
Lord
Rivers
,
Lord
Keeper
,
and
Lord
Bolingbroke
came
;
but
now
Ormond
,
Anglesea
,
Lord
Steward
,
Dartmouth
,
and
other
rabble
intrude
,
and
I
scold
at
it
;
but
now
they
pretend
as
good
a
title
as
I
;
<EOS>
and
,
indeed
,
many
Saturdays
I
am
not
there
.
 
<EOS>
The
company
being
too
many
,
I
do
n't
love
it

<EOS>
At
seven
<EOS>
this
evening
,
as
we
sat
after
dinner
at
Lord
Treasurer
's
,
a
servant
said
Lord
Peterborow
was
at
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Treasurer
and
Lord
Bolingbroke
went
out
to
meet
him
,
and
brought
him
in
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
just
returned
from
abroad
,
where
he
has
been
above
a
year
.
 
<EOS>
Soon
as
he
saw
me
,
he
left
the
Duke
of
Ormond
and
other
lords
,
and
ran
and
kissed
me
before
he
spoke
to
them
;
but
chid
me
terribly
for
not
writing
to
him
,
which
I
never
did
this
last
time
he
was
abroad
,
not
knowing
where
he
was
;
and
he
changed
places
so
often
,
it
was
impossible
a
letter
should
overtake
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
left
England
with
a
bruise
,
by
his
coach
overturning
,
<EOS>
that
made
him
spit
blood
,
and
was
so
ill
,
we
expected
every
post
to
hear
of
his
death
;
but
he
outrode
it
or
outdrank
it
,
or
something
,
and
is
come
home
lustier
than
ever
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
at
least
sixty
,
and
has
more
spirits
than
any
young
fellow
I
know
in
England
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
got
the
old
Oxford
regiment
of
horse
,
and
I
believe
will
have
a
Garter
.
 
<EOS>
I
love
the
hang

dog
dearly
.

The
Court
was
crammed
to
-
day
to
see
the
French
Ambassador
;
but
he
did
not
come
.
 
<EOS>
Did
I
never
tell
you
that
I
go
to
Court
on
Sundays
as
to
a
coffee
-
house
,
to
see
acquaintance
,
whom
I
should
otherwise
not
see
twice
a
year
?
 
<EOS>
The
Provost
and
I
dined
with
Ned
Southwell
,
by
appointment
,
in
order
to
settle
your
kingdom
,
if
my
scheme
can
be
followed
;
but
I
doubt
our
Ministry
will
be
too
tedious
.
 
<EOS>
You
must
certainly
have
a
new
Parliament
;
but
they
would
have
that
a
secret
yet
.
 
<EOS>
Our
Parliament
here
will
be
prorogued
for
three
weeks
.
<EOS>
Those
puppies
the
Dutch
will
not
yet
come
in
,
though
they
pretend
to
submit
to
the
Queen
in
everything
;
but
they
would
fain
try
first
how
our
session
begins
,
in
hopes
to
embroil
us
in
the
House
of
Lords
:
 
and
if
my
advice
had
been
taken
,
the
session
should
have
begun
,
and
we
would
have
trusted
the
Parliament
to
approve
the
steps
already
made
toward
the
peace
,
and
had
an
Address
perhaps
from
them
to
conclude
without
the
Dutch
,
if
they
would
not
agree
.
 
<EOS>
Others
are
of
my
mind
,
but
it
is
not
reckoned
so
safe
,
it
seems
;
yet
<EOS>
I
doubt
whether
the
peace
will
be
ready
so
soon
as
three
weeks
,
but
that
is
a
secret
.
 
<EOS>
Nite

<EOS>

<EOS>
Pratt
<EOS>
and
I
walked
into
the
City
to
one
Bateman
's
,
a
famous
bookseller
,
for
old
books
.
 
<EOS>
There
I
laid
out
four
pounds
like
a
fool
,
and
we
dined
at
a
hedge
ale
-
house
,
for
two
shillings
and
twopence
,
like
emperors
.
<EOS>
Let
me
see
,
I
bought
Plutarch
,
two
volumes
,
for
thirty
shillings
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
I
'll
tell
you
no
more
;
oo
do
n't
understand
Greek
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
no
news
,
and
I
have
nothing
more
to
say
to
-
day
,
and
I
ca
n't
finish
my
work
.
 
<EOS>
These
Ministers
will
not
find
time
to
do
what
I
would
have
them
.
 
<EOS>
So

<EOS>
I
was
to
have
dined
to
-
day
with
Lord
Keeper
,
but
would
not
,
because
that
brute
Sir
John
Walter
was
to
be
one
of
the
company
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
remember
he
railed
at
me
last
summer
was
twelvemonth
at
Windsor
,
and
has
never
begged
my
pardon
,
though
he
promised
to
do
it
;
and
Lord
Mansel
,
who
was
one
of
the
company
,
would
certainly
have
set
us
together
by
the
ears
,
out
of
pure
roguish
mischief
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
dined
with
Lord
Treasurer
,
where
there
was
none
but
Lord
Bolingbroke
.
 
<EOS>
I
stayed
till
eight
,
and
then
went
to
Lady
Orkney
's
,
who
has
been
sick
,
and
sat
with
her
till
twelve
,
from
whence
you
may
consider
it
is
late
,
sollahs
.
 
<EOS>
The
Parliament
was
prorogued
to
-
day
,
as
I
told
you
,
for
three
weeks
.
 
<EOS>
Our
weather
is
very
bad
and
slobbery
,
and
I
shall
spoil
my
new
hat
<EOS>
(
I
have
bought
a
new
hat
)
,
or
empty
my
pockets
.
 
<EOS>
Does
Hawkshaw
pay
the
interest
he
owes
?
 
<EOS>
Lord
Abercorn
plagues
me
to
death
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
now
not
above
six
people
to
provide
for
,
and
about
as
many
to
do
good
offices
to
;
and
thrice
as
many
that
I
will
do
nothing
for
;
nor
can
I
if
I
would
.

Nite

<EOS>
To
-
day
I
took
the
circle
of
morning
visits
.
 
<EOS>
I
went
to
the
Duchess
of
Ormond
,
and
there
was
she
,
and
Lady
Betty
,
and
Lord
Ashburnham
together
:
 
<EOS>
this
was
the
first
time
the
mother
and
daughter
saw
each
other
since
Lady
Ashburnham
's
death
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
both
in
tears
,
and
I
chid
them
for
being
together
,
and
made
Lady
Betty
go
to
her
own
chamber
;
then
sat
a
while
with
the
Duchess
,
and
went
after
Lady
Betty
,
and
all
was
well
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
something
of
farce
in
all
these
mournings
,
let
them
be
ever
so
serious
.
 
<EOS>
People
will
pretend
to
grieve
more
than
they
really
do
,
and
that
takes
off
from
their
true
grief
.
 
<EOS>
I
then
went
to
the
Duchess
of
Hamilton
,
who
never
grieved
,
but
raged
,
and
stormed
,
and
railed
.
 
<EOS>
She
is
pretty
quiet
now
,
but
has
a
diabolical
temper
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Keeper
and
his
son
,
and
their
two
ladies
,
and
I
,
dined
to
-
day
with
Mr.
Caesar
,
Treasurer
of
the
Navy
,
at
his
house
in
the
City
,
where
he
keeps
his
office
.
 
<EOS>
We
happened
to
talk
of
Brutus
,
and
I
said
something
in
his
praise
,
when
it
struck
me
immediately
that
I
had
made
a
blunder
in
doing
so
;
and
,
therefore
,
I
recollected
myself
,
and
said
,
"
Mr.
Caesar
,
I
beg
your
pardon
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
So
we
laughed
,
etc

<EOS>
I
forgot
to
tell
you
that
last
night
I
had
a
present
sent
me
<EOS>
(
I
found
it
,
when
I
came
home
,
in
my
chamber
)
of
the
finest
wild
fowl
I
ever
saw
,
with
the
vilest
letter
,
and
from
the
vilest
poet
in
the
world
,
who
sent
it
me
as
a
bribe
to
get
him
an
employment
.
 
<EOS>
I
knew
not
where
the
scoundrel
lived
,
so
<EOS>
I
could
not
send
them
back
,
and
therefore
I
gave
them
away
as
freely
as
I
got
them
,
and
have
ordered
my
man
never
to
let
up
the
poet
when
he
comes
.
 
<EOS>
The
rogue
should
have
kept
the
wings
at
least
for
his
muse
.
 
<EOS>
One
of
his
fowls
was
a
large
capon
pheasant
,
as
fat
as
a
pullet
.
 
<EOS>
I
ate
share
of
it
to
-
day
with
a
friend
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
now
a
Drawing
-
room
every
Wednesday
,
Thursday
,
and
Saturday
at
one
o'clock
.
 
<EOS>
The
Queen
does
not
come
out
;
but
all
her
Ministers
,
foreigners
,
and
persons
of
quality
are
at
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
there
to
-
day
;
and
as
Lord
Treasurer
came
towards
me
,
I
avoided
him
,
and
he
hunted
me
thrice
about
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
I
affect
never
to
take
notice
of
him
at
church
or
Court
.
 
<EOS>
He
knows
it
,
for
I
have
told
him
so
;
and
to
-
night
,
at
Lord
Masham
's
,
he
gave
an
account
of
it
to
the
company
;
but
my
reasons
are
,
that
people
seeing
me
speak
to
him
causes
a
great
deal
of
teasing
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
you
what
comes
into
my
head
,
that
I
never
knew
whether
MD
were
Whigs
or
Tories
,
and
I
value
our
conversation
the
more
that
it
never
turned
on
that
subject
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
fancy
that
Ppt
is
a
Tory
,
and
a
violent
one
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
why
;
but
methinks
<EOS>
she
looks
like
one
,
and
DD
a
sort
of
a
Trimmer
.
 
<EOS>
Am
I
right
?
 
<EOS>
I
gave
the
Examiner
a
hint
about
this
prorogation
,
and
to
praise
the
Queen
for
her
tenderness
to
the
Dutch
in
giving
them
still
more
time
to
submit
.
 
<EOS>
It
fitted
the
occasions
at
present
.

I
was

<EOS>
The
Duke
of
Ormond
<EOS>
and
I
were
to
dine
at
Lord
Orkney
's
.
 
<EOS>
The
Duke
was
at
the
Committee
,
so
I
thought
all
was
safe
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
went
there
,
they
had
almost
dined
;
for
the
Duke
had
sent
to
excuse
himself
,
which
I
never
knew
.
 
<EOS>
I
came
home
at
seven
,
and
began
a
little
whim
,
which
just
came
into
my
head
;
and
will
make
a
threepenny
pamphlet
.
 
<EOS>
It
shall
be
finished
and

This
rogue
Parnell
has
not
yet
corrected
his
poem
,
and
I
would
fain
have
it
out
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
to
-
day
with
Lord
Treasurer
,
and
his
Saturday
company
,
nine
of
us
in
all
.
 
<EOS>
They
went
away
at
seven
,
and
Lord
Treasurer
<EOS>
and
I
sat
talking
an
hour
after
.
 
<EOS>
After
dinner
he
was
talking
to
the
lords
about
the
speech
the
Queen
must
make
when
the
Parliament
meets
.
 
<EOS>
He
asked
me
how
I
would
make
it
.
<EOS>
I
was
going
to
be
serious
,
because
it
was
seriously
put
;
but
I
turned
it
to
a
jest
.
 
<EOS>
And
because
they
had
been
speaking
of
the
Duchess
of
Marlborough
going
to
Flanders
after
the
Duke
,
I
said
the
speech
should
begin
thus
:
 
"
<EOS>
My
Lords
and
Gentlemen
,
<EOS>
In
order
to
my
own
quiet
,
and
that
of
my
subjects
,
I
have
thought
fit
to
send
the
Duchess
of
Marlborough
abroad
after
the
Duke
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
This
took
well
,
and
turned
off
the
discourse
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
tell
you
I
do
not
at
all
like
the
present
situation
of
affairs
,
and
remember
I
tell
you
so
.
 
<EOS>
Things
must
be
on
another
foot
,
or
we
are
all
undone
.

I
hate
this
driving
always
to
an
inch

The

dined
at

it

print

what
relates

The
Bishop
of
Dromore
is
dying

They
thought
yesterday
he
could
not
live
two

he
is
still
alive

is
utterly

I
was
this
morning
to
see
the
Duke
and
Duchess
of
Ormond
.
 
<EOS>
The
Duke
d'Aumont
came
in
while
I
was
with
the
Duke
of
Ormond
,
and
we
complimented
each
other
like
dragons
.
 
<EOS>
A
poor
fellow
called
at
the
door
where
I
lodge
,
with
a
parcel
of
oranges
for
a
present
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
bid
my
man
know
what
his
name
was
,
and
whence
he
came
.
 
<EOS>
He
sent
word
<EOS>
his
name
was
Bun
,
and
that
I
knew
him
very
well
.
 
<EOS>
I
bid
my
man
tell
him
I
was
busy
,
and
he
could
not
speak
to
me
;
and
not
to
let
him
leave
his
oranges
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
no
more
of
it
,
but
<EOS>
I
am
sure
I
never
heard
the
name
,
and
I
shall
take
no
such
presents
from
strangers
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
he
might
be
only
some
beggar
,
who
wanted
a
little
money
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
it
might
be
something
worse
.
 
<EOS>
Let
them
keep
their
poison
for
their
rats

I
do

A
Committee
of
our
Society
dined
to

day
with
the
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
.
 
<EOS>
Our
Society
does
not
meet
now
as
usual
,
for
which
I
am
blamed
:
but
till
Lord
Treasurer
will
agree
to
give
us
money
and
employments
to
bestow
<EOS>
,
I
am
averse
to
it
;
and
he
gives
us
nothing
but
promises
.
 
<EOS>
The
Bishop
of
Dromore
is
still
alive
,
and
that
is
all
.
 
<EOS>
We
expect
every
day
he
will
die
,
and
then
Tom
Leigh
must
go
back
,
which
is
one
good
thing
to
the
town

I
believe
Pratt
will
drive
at

of
these
bishoprics

Our

I
was
to

with

a

have
written

not
politics

It
will
be
out
by

If
it
succeeds

I
will
tell
you

We
had
a
prodigious
thaw
to

day
,
as
bad
as
rain
;
yet
I
walked
like
a
good
boy
all
the
way

<EOS>
The
Bishop
of
Dromore
still
draws
breath
,
but
can
not
live
two
days
longer

<EOS>
My
large
book
lies
flat

<EOS>
Some
people
think
a
great

not

printed

<EOS>
I
believe
I
told
you
so
before

<EOS>
This
letter
shall
not
go

up
the
three
weeks
exactly

I
allow

six
weeks

<EOS>
Lord
Treasurer
quarrelled
with
me
at
Court
for
being
four
days
without
dining
with
him
;
so
I
dined
there
to
-
day
,
and
he
has
at
last
fallen
in
with
my
project
(
as
he
calls
it
)
of
coining
halfpence
and
farthings
,
with
devices
,
like
medals
,
in
honour
of

every

changing
the
device

The

appointed
to
dine
with
Ned
Southwell
to

day
,
to
talk
of
settling
your
affairs
of
Parliament
in
Ireland
,
but
there
was
a
mixture
of
company
,
and
the
Duke
of
Ormond
was
in
haste
,
and
nothing
was
done
.
<EOS>
If
your
Parliament
meets
this
summer
,
it
must
be
a
new
one
;
but
I
find
some
are
of
opinion
<EOS>
there
should
be
none
at
all
these
two
years
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
trouble
myself
no
more
about

serve

Dr.

at

to

it
was
comical
to
see
Lord
Abercorn
bowing
to
me
,
but
not
speaking
,
and
Lord
Selkirk
the
same
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
with
Lord
Treasurer
and
his
Saturday
Club
,
and
sat
with
him
two
hours
after
the
rest
were
gone
,
and
spoke
freer
to
him
of
affairs
than
I
am
afraid
others
do
,
who
might
do
more
good
.
 
<EOS>
All
his
friends
repine
,
and
shrug
their
shoulders
;
but
will
not
deal
with
him
so
freely
as
they
ought

It
is
an
odd
business
;
the
Parliament
just
going
to
sit

and
no
employments
given

They
say
they
will
give

There

a

so
Ossory

I
hinted
so
to
his
friends
two
months
ago

to
make
him
leave
off
deluding
himself
,
and
being
indiscreet

as
he
was

LONDON

1712

1713

<EOS>
We
had
such
a
terrible
storm
to
-
day
,
that
,
going
to
Lord
Bolingbroke
's
,
I
saw
a
hundred
tiles
fallen
down
;
and
one
swinger
fell
about
forty
yards
before
me
,
that
would
have
killed
a
horse
:
 
so
,
after
church
and
Court
<EOS>
,
I
walked
through
the
Park
,
and
took
a
chair
to
Lord
Treasurer
's
.
 
<EOS>
Next
door
to
his
house
,
a
tin
chimneytop
had
fallen
down
,
with
a
hundred
bricks
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
grown
calm
this
evening
.
 
<EOS>
I
wonder
had
you
such
a
wind
to

day
?
 
<EOS>
I
hate
it
as
much
as
any
hog
does

Lord
Treasurer
has
engaged
me
to
dine
again
with
him
to

morrow

He
has
those
tricks
sometimes
of
inviting
me
from
day
to
day
,
which
I
am
forced
to
break
through
.

My
little
pamphlet

This
morning
I
felt
a
little
touch

giddiness

which
has
disordered

weakened
me

its
ugly
remains
all
this
day

After
dinner
at
Lord
Treasurer
's
,
the
French
Ambassador
,
Duke
d'Aumont
,
sent
Lord
Treasurer
word
that
his
house
was
burnt
down
to
the
ground
.
 
<EOS>
It
took
fire
in
the
upper
rooms
,
while
he
was
at
dinner
with
Monteleon
,
the
Spanish
Ambassador
,
and
other
persons
;
and
soon
after
Lord
Bolingbroke
came
to
us
with
the
same
story
.
<EOS>
We
are
full
of
speculations
upon
it
,
but
I
believe
it
was
the
carelessness
of
his
French
rascally
servants
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
odd
that
this
very
day
Lord
Somers
,
Wharton
,
Sunderland
,
Halifax
,
and
the
whole
club
of
Whig
lords
,
dined
at
Pontack
's
in
the
City
,
as
I
received
private
notice
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
some
damned
design

<EOS>
I
tell
you
another
odd
thing
;
I
was
observing
it
to
Lord
Treasurer
,
that
he
was
stabbed
on
the
day
King
William
died
;
and
the
day
I
saved
his
life
,
by
opening
the
bandbox
,
was
King
William
's
birthday
.
 
<EOS>
My
friend
Mr.
Lewis
has
had
a
lie
spread
on
him
by
the
mistake
of
a
man
,
who
went
to
another
of
his
name
,
to
give
him
thanks
for
passing
his
Privy
Seal
to
come
from
France
.
 
<EOS>
That
other
Lewis
spread
about
that
the
man
brought
him
thanks
from
Lord
Perth
and
Lord
Melfort
(
<EOS>
two
lords
with
the
Pretender
)
,
for
his
great
services
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
The
Lords
will
examine
that
t'other
Lewis
to
-
morrow
in
council
;
and
I
believe
you
will
hear
of
it
in
the
prints
,
for
I
will
make
Abel
Roper
give
a
relation
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
tell
me
if
it
be
necessary
to
write
a
little
plainer
;
for
I
looked
over
a
bit
of
my
last
letter
,
and
could
hardly
read
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
mend
my
hand

if
oo
please

this
makes
four
days
together

he
has
invited
me
again
to

morrow

I
absolutely
refused
him

I
was
this
evening
at
a
christening
with
him
of
Lord
Dupplin

daughter

<EOS>
He
went
away
at
ten

but
they
kept
me
and
some
others
till
past
twelve
;
so
you
may
be
sure
<EOS>
'
tis
late
,
as
they
say
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
now
stronger
suspicions
that
the
Duke
d"Aumont
's
house
was
set
on
fire
by
malice
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
to
-
day
to
see
Lord
Keeper
,
who
has
quite
lost
his
voice
with
a
cold
.
 
<EOS>
There
Dr.
Radcliffe
told
me
that
it
was
the
Ambassador
's
confectioner
set
the
house
on
fire
by
boiling
sugar
,
and
going
down
and
letting
it
boil
over
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
others
still
think
differently

to
judge

where
the
Spanish
Ambassador
talked
to
me
as
if
he
did
not
suspect
any
design
in
burning
d'Aumont
's
house
:
 
but
Abbe
Gaultier
,
Secretary
for
France
here
,
said
quite
otherwise
;
and
that
d'Aumont
had
a
letter
the
very
same
day
to
let
him
know
his
house
should
be
burnt
,
and
they
tell
several
other
circumstances
too
tedious
to
write
.
 
<EOS>
One
is
,
that
a
fellow
mending
the
tiles
just
when

saw

in

Neither

Abercorn

speak

Our
Society
met
to
-
day
,
fourteen
of
us
,
and
at
a
tavern
.
 
<EOS>
We
now
resolve
to
meet
but
once
a
fortnight
,
and
have
a
Committee
every
other
week
of
six
or
seven
,
to
consult
about
doing
some
good
.
 
<EOS>
I
proposed
another
message
to
Lord
Treasurer
by
three
principal
members
,
to
give
a
hundred
guineas
to
a
certain
person
,
and
they
are
to
urge
it
as
well
as
they
can
.
 
<EOS>
We
also
raised
sixty
guineas
upon
our
own
Society
;
but
I
made
them
do
it
by
sessors
,
and
I
was
one
of
them
,
and
we
fitted
our
tax
to
the
several
estates
.
 
<EOS>
The
Duke
of
Ormond
pays
ten
guineas
,
and
I
the
third
part
of
a
guinea
;
at
that
rate
,
they
may
tax
as
often
as
they
please
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
but
I
must
answer
oor

<EOS>
I
have
drank
Spa
waters
this
two
or
three
days
;
but
they
do
not
pass
,
and
make
me
very
giddy
.
 
<EOS>
I
an't
<EOS>
well
;
faith
,
I
'll
take
them
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
I
sauntered
after
church
with
the
Provost
to
-
day
to
see
a
library
to
be
sold
,
and
dined
at
five
with
Lord
Orkney
.
 
<EOS>
We
still
think
there
was
malice
in
burning
d'Aumont
's
house
.
 
<EOS>
I
hear
little
Harrison
is
come
over
;
it
was
he
I
sent
to
Utrecht
.
<EOS>
He
is
now
Queen
's
Secretary
to
the
Embassy
,
and
has
brought
with
him
the
Barrier
Treaty
,
as
it
is
now
corrected
by
us
,
and
yielded
to
by
the
Dutch
,
which
was
the
greatest
difficulty
to
retard
the
peace
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
he
will
bring
over
the
peace
a
month
hence
,
for
we
will
send
him
back
as
soon
as
possible
.
<EOS>
I
long
to
see
the
little
brat
,
my
own
creature
.
 
<EOS>
His
pay
is
in
all
a
thousand
pounds
a
year
,
and
they
have
never
paid
him
a
groat
,
though
I
have
teased
their
hearts
out
.
 
<EOS>
He
must
be
three
or
four
hundred
pounds
in
debt
at
least
,
the
brat
!
 
<EOS>
Let
me
go
to

Harrison
was
with
me
this
morning
:
 
<EOS>
we
talked
three
hours
,
and
then
I
carried
him
to
Court
.
 
<EOS>
When
we
went
down
to
the
door
of
my
lodging
,
I
found
a
coach
waited
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
chid
him
for
it
;
but
he
whispered
me
<EOS>
it
was
impossible
to
do
otherwise
;
and
in
the
coach
he
told
me
he
had
not
one
farthing
in
his
pocket
to
pay
it
;
and
therefore
took
the
coach
for
the
whole
day
,
and
intended
to
borrow
money
somewhere
or
other
.
 
<EOS>
So
there
was
the
Queen
's
Minister
entrusted
in
affairs
of
the
greatest
importance
,
without
a
shilling
in
his
pocket
to
pay
a
coach
!
 
<EOS>
I
paid
him
while
he
was
with
me
seven
guineas
,
<EOS>
in
part
of
a
dozen
of
shirts
he
bought
me
in
Holland
.
 
<EOS>
I
presented
him
to
the
Duke
of
Ormond
,
and
several
lords
at
Court
;
and
I
contrived
it
so
that
Lord
Treasurer
came
to
me
and
asked
(
I
had
Parnell
by
me
)
<EOS>
whether
that
was
Dr.
Parnell
,
and
came
up
and
spoke
to
him
with
great
kindness
,
and
invited
him
to
his
house
.
 
<EOS>
I
value
myself
upon
making
the
Ministry
desire
to
be
acquainted
with
Parnell
,
and
not
Parnell
with
the
Ministry
.
 
<EOS>
His
poem
is
almost
fully
corrected
,
and
shall
soon
be
out
.
 
<EOS>
Here
's
enough
for
to
-
day
:
only
to
tell
you
that
I
was
in
the
City
with
my
printer
to
alter
an
Examiner
about
my
friend
Lewis
's
story
,
which
will
be
told
with
remarks
.
 
<EOS>

<EOS>
I
could
do
nothing
till
to
-
day
about
the
Examiner
,
but
the
printer
came
this
morning
,
and
I
dictated
to
him
what
was
fit
to
be
said
,
and
then
Mr.
Lewis
came
,
and
corrected
it
as
he
would
have
it
;
so
I
was
neither
at
church
nor
Court
.
 
<EOS>
The
Duke
of
Ormond
<EOS>
and
I
dined
at
Lord
Orkney
's
.
 
<EOS>
I
left
them
at
seven
,
and
sat
with
Sir
Andrew
Fountaine
,
who
has
a
very
bad
sore
leg
,
for
which
he
designs
to
go
to
France
.
 
<EOS>
Fais

here
's
a

and
one

Oh

but
I

now
but
once

<EOS>
The
Parliament
is
to
sit
on
the
third
,
but
will
adjourn
for
three
or
four
days
;
for
the
Queen
is
laid
up
with
the
gout
,
and
both
Speakers
out
of
order
,
though
one
of
them
,
the
Lord
Keeper
,
is
almost
well
.
 
<EOS>
I
spoke
to
the
Duke
of
Ormond
a
good
deal
about
Ireland
.
 
<EOS>
We
do
not
altogether
agree
,
nor
am
<EOS>
I
judge
enough
of
Irish
affairs
;
but
I
will
speak
to
Lord
Treasurer
to
-
morrow
,
that
we
three
may
settle
them
some
way
or
other

I
had
a
letter
some
days
ago
from
Moll
Gery
;
her
name
is
now
Wigmore
,
and
her
husband
has
turned
parson
.
 
<EOS>
She
desires
nothing
but
that
I
would
get
Lord
Keeper
to
give
him
a
living
;
but
I
will
send
her
no
answer
,
though
she
desires
it
much
.
 
<EOS>
She
still
makes
mantuas
at
Farnham
.
 
<EOS>
It
rained
all
this
day
,
and
Dilly
came
to
me
,
and
was
coaching
it
into
the
City
;
so
I
went
with
him
for
a
shaking
,
because
it
would
not
cost
me
a
farthing
.
 
<EOS>
There
I
met
my
friend
Stratford
,
the
merchant
,
who
is
going
abroad
to
gather
up
his
debts
,
and
be
clear
in
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
He
begged
that
I
would
dine
with
some
merchant
friends
of
ours
there
,
because
it
was
the
last
time
I
should
see
him
:
 
<EOS>
so
I
did
,
and
thought
to
have
seen
Lord
Treasurer
in
the
evening
,
but
he
happened
to
go
out
at
five
;
so
I
visited
some
friends
,
and
came
home
.
 
<EOS>
And
now
I
have
the
greatest
part
of
your
letter
to
answer
;
<EOS>
and
yet
I
will
not
do
it
to
-
night
,
say
what
oo
please
.
 
<EOS>
The
Parliament
meets
to
-
morrow
,
but
will
be
prorogued
for
a
fortnight
;
which
disappointment
will
,
I
believe
,
vex
abundance
of
them
,
though
they
are
not
Whigs
;
for
they
are
forced
to
be
in
town
at
expense
for
nothing
:
but
we
want
an
answer
from
Spain
,
before
we
are
sure
of
everything
being
right
for
the
peace
;
and
God
knows
whether
we
can
have
that
answer
this
month
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
a
most
ticklish
juncture
of
affairs
;
we
are
always
driving
to
an
inch
:
 
<EOS>
I
am
weary
of
it
.

<EOS>
The
Parliament
met
,
and
was
prorogued
,
as
I
said
,
and
I
found
some
cloudy
faces
,
and
heard
some
grumbling
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
got
over
all
our
difficulties
with
France
,
I
think
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
now
settled
all
the
articles
of
commerce
between
us
and
them
,
wherein
they
were
very
much
disposed
to
play
the
rogue
if
we
had
not
held
them
to
[
it
]
;
and
this
business
we
wait
from
Spain
is
to
prevent
some
other
rogueries
of
the
French
,
who
are
finding
an
evasion
to
trade
to
the
Spanish
West
Indies
;
but
I
hope
we
shall
prevent
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
with
Lord
Treasurer
,
and
he
was
in
good
humour
enough
.
 
<EOS>
I
gave
him
that
part
of
my
book
in
manuscript
to
read
where
his
character
was
,
and
drawn
pretty
freely
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
reading
and
correcting
it
with
his
pencil
,
when
the
Bishop
of
St.
David
's
(
now
removing
to
Hereford
)
came
in
and
interrupted
us
.
 
<EOS>
I
left
him
at
eight
,
and
sat
till
twelve
with
the
Provost
and
Bishop
of
Clogher
at
the
Provost
's
.

<EOS>
I
was
to
-
day
at
Court
,
but
kept
out
of
Lord
Treasurer
's
way
,
because
I
was
engaged
to
the
Duke
of
Ormond
,
where
I
dined
,
and
,
I
think
,
ate
and
drank
too
much
.
 
<EOS>
I
sat
this
evening
with
Lady
Masham
,
and
then
with
Lord
Masham
and
Lord
Treasurer
at
Lord
Masham
's
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
last
year
,
you
may
remember
,
my
constant
evening
place
.
 
<EOS>
I
saw
Lady
Jersey
with
Lady
Masham
,
who
has
been
laying
out
for
my
acquaintance
,
and
has
forced
a
promise
for
me
to
drink
chocolate
with
her
in
a
day
or
two
,
which
I
know
not
whether
I
shall
perform
<EOS>
(
I
have
just
mended
my
pen
,
you
see
)
,
for
I
do
not
much
like
her
character
;
but
she
is
very
malicious
,
and
therefore
I
think
I
must
keep
fair
with
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
send
this
letter
till
Saturday
next
<EOS>

I
find
;
so
I
will
answer

I
see
no
different
days
of
the
month
;
yet
it
is
dated
January

<EOS>
so
it
was
long
a
coming
.
 
<EOS>
I
did
not
write
to
Dr.
Coghill
that
I
would
have
nothing
in
Ireland
,
but
that
I
was
soliciting
nothing
anywhere
,
and
that
is
true
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
named
Dr.
Sterne
to
Lord
Treasurer
,
Lord
Bolingbroke
,
and
the
Duke
of
Ormond
,
for
a
bishopric
,
and
I
did
it
heartily
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
not
what
will
come
of
it
;
but
I
tell
you
as
a
great
secret
that
I
have
made
the
Duke
of
Ormond
promise
me
to
recommend
nobody
till
he
tells
me
,
and
this
for
some
reasons
too
long
to
mention

fine
clothes

I
went

I

where
the
ladies
were

When
I
came
from
Lord
Keeper

I
called
at
Lord
Treasurer

,
because
I
heard
he
was
very
fine
,
and
that
was
a
new
thing
;
and
it
was
true
,
for
his
coat
and
waistcoat
were
embroidered

I
have
seen
the
Provost
often
since
,
and
never
spoke
to
him
to
speak
to
the
Temples
about
Daniel
Carr

do

I

I

I

I

It

I
intended
to
have
dined
with
Lord

went
to
see
Sir
Andrew
Fountaine
,
and
he
kept
me
to
dinner
,
which
saved
coach

hire

and
I
stayed
with
him
all
the
afternoon
,
and
lost
thirteen
shillings
and
sixpence
at
ombre

There
was
management

Lord

will
chide

The

Lady

I

I
thought
to
have
dined
with
Lord

to

day
,
but
he
dined
abroad
at
Tom
Harley
's
;
so
I
dined
at
Lord
Masham

,
and
was
winning
all
I
had
lost
playing
with
Lady
Masham
at
crown
picquet
,
when
we
went
to
pools
,
and
I
lost
it
again

Lord

came
in

Miss

am
gone
out

tells
me
at

I
was
this
morning
to
see
Lady
Jersey
,
and
we
have
made
twenty
parties
about
dining
together
,

I
shall
hardly
keep
one
of
them

She
is
reduced
after
all
her
greatness
to
seven

I
stole
away
from
Lord

intended
to
have
passed
the

Sir

his

met
them
in

have
there
sat

My

I
was
at

made

walk
with

in

Yesterday

he
says

He
is
in
deep

I
dined
to

with
our
Society

the
greatest
dinner
I
have
ever
seen
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
at
Jack
Hill
's
,
the
Governor
of
Dunkirk
.
 
<EOS>
I
gave
an
account
of
sixty
guineas
I
had
collected
,
and
am
to
give
them
away
to
two
authors
to
-
morrow
;
and
Lord
Treasurer
has
promised
us
a
hundred
pounds
to
reward
some
others

<EOS>
I
found
a
letter
on
my
table
last
night
to
tell
me
that
poor
little
Harrison
,
the
Queen
's
Secretary
,
that
came
lately
from
Utrecht
with
the
Barrier
Treaty
,
was
ill
,
and
desired
to
see
me
at
night
;
but
it
was
late
,
and
I
could
not
go
till
to
-
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
often
mentioned
him
in
my
letters
,
you
may
remember
.

<EOS>
I
went
in
the
morning
,
and
found
him
mighty
ill
,
and
got
thirty
guineas
for
him
from
Lord
Bolingbroke
,
and
an
order
for
a
hundred
pounds
from
the
Treasury
to
be
paid
him
to

morrow

and
I
have
got
him
removed
to
Knightsbridge
for
air
.

He
has
a
fever

inflammation
on
his
lungs

I
hope
will
do
well

I
was
to
see
a
poor
poet
,
one
Mr.
Diaper
,
in
a
nasty
garret
,
very
sick
.
 
<EOS>
I
gave
him
twenty
guineas
from
Lord
Bolingbroke
,
and
disposed
the
other
sixty
to
two
other
authors
,
and
desired
a
friend
to
receive
the
hundred
pounds
for
poor
Harrison
,
and
will
carry
it
to
him
to
-
morrow
morning
.
 
<EOS>
I
sent
to
see
how
he
did
,
and
he
is
extremely
ill
;
and
I
very
much
afflicted
for
him
,
for
he
is
my
own
creature
,
and
in
a
very
honourable
post
,
and
very
worthy
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
in
the
City

<EOS>
I
am
in
much
concern

this
poor

took
Parnell
this

we
walked
to

poor
Harrison

<EOS>
I
had
the
hundred
pounds
in
my
pocket

<EOS>
I
told
Parnell
<EOS>
I
was
afraid
to
knock
at
the
door
;
my
mind
misgave
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
knocked
,
and
his
man
in
tears
told
me
his
master
was
dead
an
hour
before
.
 
<EOS>
Think
what
grief
this
is
to
me

<EOS>
I
went
to
his

have
been
ordering
things
for
his
funeral
with
as
little
cost
as
possible

to

Lord

concerned

I
told

I
could
not
dine
with
Lord
Treasurer

nor
anywhere
else

but
got
a
bit
of
meat
toward

grieved

Pray

God
Almighty
bless

I
dined

with
Mr.
Rowe
and
a
projector
,
who
has
been
teasing
me
with
twenty
schemes
to
get
grants
;
and
I
do
n't
like
one
of
them
;
and
,
besides
,
I
was
out
of
humour
for
the
loss
of

At
ten

I
was
at

I
ordered
to
be

We
had

one

when
it
was
carrying
us
home
after
the
funeral

the
braces
broke

we
were
forced
to
sit
in
it

and
have
it
held
up

my

went
for
chairs

at
eleven

these
four
days

nor
can
I
till

I
have
several
engagements
till
then

and
he
will
chide
me
to
some
purpose

I
am
perplexed
with
this
hundred
pounds
of
poor
Harrison
's
,
what
to
do
with
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
pay
his
relations
till
they
administer
,
for
he

debt

nothing

The

was
prorogued

grumble

the
good
of
it

the
peace
can
not
be
finished
by
the
time
they
meet

there
are
so
many
fiddling
things
to
do

you
have

I
have
given
away

send
every

does

she
is
very
full

in
no

will
lose

The
Earl

been
teasing
me
these
three
months
to
dine
with
him
;
and
this
day
was
appointed
about
a
week
ago
,
and
I
named
my
company
;
Lord
Stawel
,
Colonel
Disney
,
and
Dr.
Arbuthnot
;
but
the
two
last
slipped
out
their
necks
,
and
left
Stawell
and
me
to
dine
there
.
 
<EOS>
We
did
not
dine
till
seven
,
because
it
is
Ash
Wednesday
.
 
<EOS>
We
had
nothing
but
fish
,
which
Lord
Stawell
could
not
eat
,
and
got
a
broiled
leg
of
a
turkey
.

Our
wine
was
poison

yet
the

has
twelve

His

were
raw

his

tallow

He
shall
not

again

everybody
has
laughed
at
me
for
dining

I
was
to

day
to
let
Harrison

know
I
could

There
were

believe
they
think
the
peace
must
be
made

so
come
to

to
speak
to
Lord
Bolingbroke
to
look
over
Parnell
's
poem
since
it
is
corrected
;
and
Parnell
and
I
dined
with
him
,
and
he
has
shown
him
three
or
four
more
places
to
alter
a
little
.
 
<EOS>
Lady
Bolingbroke
came
down
to
us
while
we
were
at
dinner
,
and
Parnell
stared
at
her
as
if
she
were
a
goddess
.
 
<EOS>
I
thought
she
was
like
Parnell
's
wife
,
and
he
thought
so
too
.
<EOS>
Parnell
is
much
pleased
with
Lord
Bolingbroke
's
favour
to
him
,
and
I
hope
it
may
one
day
turn
to
his
advantage

His

will
be

Hyde
,
the
Spanish
Ambassador
,
the
Duke
d'Atree
,
another
Spaniard
,
and
I
,
dined
to
-
day
by
appointment
with
Lord
Bolingbroke
;
but
they
fell
a
drinking
so
many
Spanish
healths
in
champagne
that
I
stole
away
to
the
ladies
,
and
drank
tea
till
eight
;
and
then
went
and
lost
my
money
at
ombre
with
Sir
Andrew
Fountaine
,
who
has
a
very
bad
leg
.
<EOS>
Miss
Ashe
is
past
all
danger
;
and
her
eye
,
which
was
lately
bad
<EOS>
(
I
suppose
one
effect
of
her
distemper
)
,
is
now
better
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
let
the
Bishop
see
me
,
nor
shall
this
good
while
.
 
<EOS>
Good
luck
!
<EOS>
when
I
came
home
,
I
warrant
,
I
found
a
letter
from
MD
,
No.38
;
and
oo
write
so
small
nowadays
<EOS>
,
I
hope
oo
poor
eyes
are
better
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
this
shall
go
to
-
morrow
se'nnight
,
with
a
bill
for
MD
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
speak
to
Mr.
Griffin
to
-
morrow
about
Ppt
's
brother
Filby
,
and
desire
,
whether
he
deserves
or
no
,
that
his
employment
may
be
mended
;
that
is
to
say
,
if
I
can
see
Griffin
;
otherwise
not
;
and
I
'll
answer
oo
rettle
hen
<EOS>

Pdfr
think
fit

<EOS>
Methinks
<EOS>
I
writ
a
little
saucy
last
night
.
 
<EOS>
I
mean
the
last
.
.
.
  
<EOS>
I
saw
Griffin
at
Court
.
 
<EOS>
He
says
he
knows
nothing
of
a
salt
-
work
at
Recton
;
but
that
he
will
give
Filby
a
better
employment
,
and
desires
Filby
will
write
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
knew
how
to
write
to
Filby
,
I
would
;
but
pray
do
you
.
 
<EOS>
Bid
him
make
no
mention
of
you
;
but
only
let
Mr.
Griffin
know
that
he
has
the
honour
to
be
recommended
by
Dr.
S
#
#
#
#
,
etc
.
;
that
he
will
endeavour
to
deserve
,
etc
.
<EOS>
;
and
if
you
dictated
a
whole
letter
for
him
,
it
would
be
better
;
I
hope
he
can
write
and
spell
well
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
inquire
for
a
direction
to
Griffin
before
I
finish
this
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
with
Lord
Treasurer
and
seven
lords
to
-
day
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
Saturday
is
his
great
day
,
but
I
sat
with
them
alone
till
eight
,
and
then
came
home
,
and
have
been
writing
a
letter
to
Mrs.
Davis
,
at
York
.
 
<EOS>
She
took
care
to
have
a
letter
delivered
for
me
at
Lord
Treasurer
's
;
for
I
would
not
own
one
she
sent
by
post
.
 
<EOS>
She
reproaches
me
for
not
writing
to
her
these
four
years
;
and
I
have
honestly
told
her
it
was
my
way
never
to
write
to
those
whom
I
am
never
likely
to
see
,
unless
I
can
serve
them
,
which
I
can
not
her
,

<EOS>
I
dined
to
-
day
at
Lord
Orkney
's
,
with
the
Duke
of
Ormond
and
Sir
Thomas
Hanmer
.
 
<EOS>
Have
you
ever
heard
of
the
latter
?
 
<EOS>
He
married
the
Duchess
of
Grafton
in
his
youth
<EOS>
(
she
dined
with
us
too
)
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
the
most
considerable
man
in
the
House
of
Commons
.
 
<EOS>
He
went
last
spring
to
Flanders
,
with
the
Duke
of
Ormond
;
from
thence
to
France
,
and
was
going
to
Italy
;
but
the
Ministry
sent
for
him
,
and
he
has
been
come
over
about
ten
days
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
much
out
of
humour
with
things
:
 
<EOS>
he
thinks
the
peace
is
kept
off
too
long
,
and
is
full
of
fears
and
doubts
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
thought
he
is
designed
for
Secretary
of
State
,
instead
of
Lord
Dartmouth
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
been
acquainted
these
two
years
;
and
I
intend
,
in
a
day
or
two
,
to
have
an
hour
's
talk
with
him
on
affairs
.
 
<EOS>
I
saw
the
Bishop
of
Clogher
at
Court
;
Miss
is
recovering
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
not
how
much
she
will
be
marked
.
<EOS>
The
Queen
is
slowly
mending
of
her
gout
,
and
intends
to
be
brought
in
a
chair
to
Parliament
when
it
meets
,
which
will
be
March
3
;
for
I
suppose
they
will
prorogue
no
more
;
yet
the
peace
will
not
be
signed
then
,
and
we
apprehend
the
Tories
themselves
will
many
of
them
be
discontented
.

It
was
ill
weather
to
-
day
,
and
I
dined
with
Sir
Andrew
Fountaine
,
and
in
the
evening
played
at
ombre
with
him
and
the
Provost
,
and
won
twenty
-
five
shillings
;
so
I
have
recovered
myself
pretty
well
.
 
<EOS>
Dilly
has
been
dunning
me
to
see
Fanny
Manley
;
but
I
have
not
yet
been
able
to
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Ashe
is
now
quite
out
of
danger
;
and
hope
will
not
be
much
marked
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
tell
how
to
direct
to
Griffin
;
and
think
he
lives
in
Bury
Street
,
near
St.
James
's
Street
,
hard
by
me
;
but
I
suppose
your
brother
may
direct
to
him
to
the
Salt
Office
,
and
,
as
I
remember
,
he
knows
his
Christian
name
,
because
he
sent
it
me
in
the
list
of
the
Commissioners
.

I
walked
this
morning
to
Chelsea
,
to
see
Dr.
Atterbury
,
Dean
of
Christ
Church
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
business
with
him
about
entering
Mr.
Fitzmaurice
,
my
Lord
Kerry
's
son
,
into
his
College
;
and
Lady
Kerry
is
a
great
favourite
of
mine
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Harley
,
Lord
Dupplin
,
young
Bromley
<EOS>
the
Speaker
's
son
,
and
I
,
dined
with
Dr.
Stratford
and
some
other
clergymen
;
<EOS>
but
I
left
them
at
seven
to
go
to
Lady
Jersey
,
to
see
Monteleon
the
Spanish
Ambassador
play
at
ombre
.
 
<EOS>
Lady
Jersey
was
abroad
,
and
I
chid
the
servants
,
and
made
a
rattle
;
but
since
I
came
home
she
sent
me
a
message
that
I
was
mistaken
,
and
that
the
meeting
is
to
be
to
-
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
worse
memory
than
when
I
left
you
,
and
every
day
forget
appointments
;
but
here
my
memory
was
by
chance
too
good
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
'll
go
to
-
morrow
;
for
Lady
Catherine
Hyde
and
Lady
Bolingbroke
are
to
be
there
by
appointment
,
and
I
listed
up
my
periwig
,
and
all
,
to
make
a
figure
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
who
can
help
it
?
 
<EOS>
Not
I
,
vow
to
.
.

!

Nite

<EOS>
Lord
Treasurer
met
me
last
night
at
Lord
Masham
's
,
and
thanked
me
for
my
company
in
a
jeer
,
because
I
had
not
dined
with
him
in
three
days
.
 
<EOS>
He
chides
me
if
I
stay
away
but
two
days
together
.
 
<EOS>
What
will
this
come
to
?
 
<EOS>
Nothing
.
<EOS>
My
grandmother
used
to
say
,
"
More
of
your
lining
,
and
less
of
your
dining
.
"
<EOS>
However
,
I
dined
with
him
,
and
could
hardly
leave
him
at
eight
,
to
go
to
Lady
Jersey
's
,
where
five
or
six
foreign
Ministers
were
,
and
as
many
ladies
.
<EOS>
Monteleon
played
like
the
English
,
and
cried
"
gacco
,
"
and
knocked
his
knuckles
for
trump
,
and
played
at
small
games
like
Ppt
.
 
<EOS>
Lady
Jersey
whispered
me
to
stay
and
sup
with
the
ladies
when
the
fellows
were
gone
;
but
they
played
till
eleven
,
and
I
would
not
stay
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
this
letter
must
go
on
Saturday
<EOS>
;
that
's
certain
;
and
it
is
not
half
full
yet
.
 
<EOS>
Lady
Catherine
Hyde
had
a
mighty
mind
I
should
be
acquainted
with
Lady
Dalkeith
,
her
sister
,
the
Duke
of
Monmouth
's
eldest
son
's
widow
,
who
was
of
the
company
to
-
night
;
but
I
did
not
like
her
;
she
paints
too
much
.

<EOS>
This
day
our
Society
met
at
the
Duke
of
Ormond
's
,
but
I
had
business
that
called
me
another
way
;
so
I
sent
my
excuses
,
and
dined
privately
with
a
friend
.
 
<EOS>
Besides
,
Sir
Thomas
Hanmer
whispered
me
last
night
at
Lady
Jersey
's
that
I
must
attend
Lord
Treasurer
and
Duke
of
Ormond
at
supper
at
his
house
to
-
night
;
which
I
did
at
eleven
,
and
stayed
till
one
,
so
oo
may
be
sure
'
tis
late
enough
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
the
Duchess
of
Grafton
,
and
the
Duke
her
son
;
nine
of
us
in
all
.
 
<EOS>
The
Duke
of
Ormond
chid
me
for
not
being
at
the
Society
to
-
day
,
and
said
sixteen
were
there
.
 
<EOS>
I
said
I
never
knew
sixteen
people
good
company
in
my
life
;
no
,
fais
,
nor
eight
either
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
no
news
in
this
town
at
all
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
why
I
do
n't
write
you
news
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
less
of
what
passes
than
anybody
,
because
I
go
to
no
coffee
-
house
,
nor
see
any
but
Ministers
,
and
such
people
;
and
Ministers
never
talk
politics
in
conversation
.
 
<EOS>
The
Whigs
are
forming
great
schemes
against
the
meeting
of
Parliament
,
which
will
be
next
Tuesday
,
I
still
think
,
without
fail
;
and
we
hope
to
hear
by
then
that
the
peace
is
ready
to
sign
.

I
passed
a
very
insipid
day
,
and
dined
privately
with
a
friend
in
the
neighbourhood
.
 
<EOS>
Did
I
tell
you
that
I
have
a
very
fine
picture
of
Lady
Orkney
,
an
original
,
by
Sir
Godfrey
Kneller
,
three
-
quarters
length
?
 
<EOS>
I
have
it
now
at
home
,
with
a
fine
frame
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Bolingbroke
and
Lady
Masham
have
promised
to
sit
for
me
;
but
I
despair
of
Lord
Treasurer
;
only
I
hope
he
will
give
me
a
copy
,
and
then
I
shall
have
all
the
pictures
of
those
I
really
love
here
;
just
half
a
dozen
;
only
I
'll
make
Lord
Keeper
give
me
his
print
in
a
frame
.
 
<EOS>
This
letter
must
go
to
-
morrow
,
because
of
sending
ME
a
bill
;
else
it
should
not
till
next
week
,
I
assure
oo
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
little
to
do
now
with
my
pen
;
for
my
grand
business
stops
till
they
are
more
pressing
,
and
till
something
or
other
happens
;
and
I
believe
I
shall
return
with
disgust
to
finish
it
,
it
is
so
very
laborious
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
Thomas
Hanmer
has
my

the
Duke
d'Atree
lost
six
times

<EOS>
I
was
at
Court
to
-
day
,
when
the
Abbe
Gaultier
whispered
me
that
a
courier
was
just
come
with
an
account
that
the
French
King
had
consented
to
all
the
Queen
's
demands
,
and
his
consent
was
carried
to
Utrecht
,
and
the
peace
will
be
signed
in
a
few
days
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
the
general
peace
can
not
be
so
soon
ready
;
but
that
is
no
matter
.
 
<EOS>
The
news
presently
ran
about
the
Court
.
 
<EOS>
I
saw
the
Queen
carried
out
in
her
chair
,
to
take
the
air
in
the
garden
.
 
<EOS>
I
met
Griffin
at
Court
,
and
he
told
me
that
orders
were
sent
to
examine
Filby
;
and
,
if
he
be
fit

to
make
him
(
I
think
he
called
it
)
an
assistant
;
I
do
n't

Supervisor

I
think

but
it
is
some
employment
a

better

The
Parliament
will
have
another

@@@Tis
out

whether
I
answered
all
your
letter
in
my
last
yesterday
or
no

I
think
I
was
in
haste

could
not

now
I
see
I
answered
a
good

of
it

no

only
about
your
brother

and
ME
's
bill

<EOS>
I
dined
with
Lady
Orkney

and
we
talked
politics
till
eleven
at
night

,
as
usual

found
everything
wrong

put
ourselves
out

have

sent

I
box

I
get

come
naked
into

lodging

so

I
dined
with
my
printer
,
and
walked
home
,
and
went
to
sit
with
Lady
Clarges
.
 
<EOS>
I
found
four
of
them
at
whist
;
Lady
Godolphin
was
one
.
 
<EOS>
I
sat
by
her
,
and
talked
of
her
cards
,
etc
.
,
but
she
would
not
give
me
one
look
,
nor
say
a
word
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
She
refused
some
time
ago
to
be
acquainted
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
she
is
Lord
Marlborough
's
eldest
daughter
.
 
<EOS>
She
is
a
fool
for
her
pains
,
and
I
'll
pull
her
down
.
 
<EOS>
What
can
I
do
for
Dr.
Smith
's
daughter
's
husband
?
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
personal
credit
with
any
of
the
Commissioners
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
speak
to
Keatley
;
but
I
believe
it
will
signify
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
Customs
people
must
rise
by
degrees
,
and
he
must
at
first
take
what
is
very
low
,
if
he
be
qualified
for
that
.
 
<EOS>
Ppt
mistakes
me
;
I
am
not
angry
at
your
recommending
anyone
to
me
,
provided
you
will
take
my
answer
.
 
<EOS>
Some
things
are
in
my
way
,
and
then
I
serve
those
I
can
.
 
<EOS>
But
people
will
not
distinguish
,
but
take
things
ill
,
when
I
have
no
power
;
but
Ppt
is
wiser
.
 
<EOS>
And
employments
in
general
are
very
hard
to
be
got

I
dined
to

with
Lord

who
chid
me
for
my
absence
,
which
was
only
from
Saturday
last
.
 
<EOS>
The
Parliament
was
again
prorogued
for
a
week
,
and
I
suppose
the
peace
will
be
ready
by
then
,
and
the
Queen
will
be
able
to
be
brought
to
the
House
,
and
make
her
speech
.
 
<EOS>
I
saw
Dr.
Griffith
two
or
three
months
ago
,
at
a
Latin
play
at
Westminster
;
but
did
not
speak
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
he
will
not
die
;
I
should
be
sorry
for
Ppt
's
sake
;
he
is
very
tender
of
her
.
<EOS>
I
have
long
lost
all
my
colds
,
and
the
weather
mends
a

<EOS>
I
take
some
steel
drops
,
and
my
head
is
pretty
well
.
 
<EOS>
I
walk
when
I
can
,
but
am
grown
very
idle
;
and
,
not
finishing
my
thing
,
I
gamble
abroad
and
play
at
ombre
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
be
more
careful
in
my
physic
than
Mrs.
Price
:
 
'
tis
<EOS>
not
a
farthing
matter
her
death
,
I
think
<EOS>
;
and
so
I
say
no
more
to

night
,

will
read
a
dull
book
,

go

Mr.
Ford
has
been
this
half
-
year
inviting
me
to
dine
at
his
lodgings
:
 
<EOS>
so
I
did
to
-
day
,
and
brought
the
Provost
and
Dr.
Parnell
with
me
,
and
my
friend
Lewis
was
there
.
 
<EOS>
Parnell
went
away
,
and
the
other
three
played
at
ombre
,
and
I
looked
on
;
which
I
love
,
and
would
not
play
.
 
<EOS>
Tisdall
is
a
pretty
fellow
,
as
you
say
;
and
when
I
come
back
to
Ireland
with
nothing
,
he
will
condole
with
me
with
abundance
of
secret
pleasure
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
I
told
you
what
he
wrote
to
me
,
that
I
have
saved
England
,
and
he
Ireland
;
but
I
can
bear
that
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
learned
to
hear
and
see
,
and
say
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
to
see
the
Duchess
of
Hamilton
to
-
day
,
and
met
Blith
of
Ireland
just
going
out
of
her
house
into
his
coach
.
 
<EOS>
I
asked
her
how
she
came
to
receive
young
fellows
.
 
<EOS>
It
seems
he
had
a
ball
in
the
Duke
of
Hamilton
's
house
when
the
Duke
died
;
and
the
Duchess
got
an
advertisement
put
in
the
Postboy
,
reflecting
on
the
ball
,
because
the
Marlborough
daughters
were
there
;
and
Blith
came
to
beg
the
Duchess
's
pardon
,
and
clear
himself
.

is
well
almost
again

<EOS>
I
have
many
visits
to

day
.
 
<EOS>
I
met
Blith
at
the
Duke
of
Ormond
's
;
and
he
begged
me
to
carry
him
to
the
Duchess
of
Hamilton
,
to
beg
her
pardon
again
.
 
<EOS>
I
did
on
purpose
to
see
how
the
blunderbuss
behaved
himself
;
but
I
begged
the
Duchess
to
use
him
mercifully
,
for
she
is
the
devil
of
a
teaser
.
 
<EOS>
The
good
of
it
is
,
she
ought
to
beg
his
pardon
,
for
he
meant
no
harm
;
yet
she
would
not
allow
him
to
put
in
an
advertisement
to
clear
himself
from
hers
,
though
hers
was
all
a
lie
.
 
<EOS>
He
appealed
to
me
,
and
I
gravely
gave
it
against
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
at
Court
to
-
day
,
and
the
foreign
Ministers
have
got
a
trick
of
employing
me
to
speak
for
them
to
Lord
Treasurer
and
Lord
Bolingbroke
;
which
I
do
when
the
case
is
reasonable
.

The

need
not
fear

I

their
Governor

I
dined
with
Sir
Thomas
Hanmer
and
his
Duchess
.
 
<EOS>
The
Duke
of
Ormond
was
there
,
but
we
parted
soon
,
and
I
went
to
visit
Lord
Pembroke
for
the
first
time
;
but
it
was
to
see
some
curious
books
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Cholmondeley
came
in
;
but
I
would
not
talk
to
him
,
though
he
made
many
advances
.

I
hate
the
scoundrel
for

at
an
auction
of
pictures
with
Pratt
,
and
laid
out
two
pound
five
shillings
for
a
picture
of
Titian
,
and
if
it
were
a
Titian
it
would
be
worth
twice
as
many
pounds
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
am
cheated
,
I
'll
part
with
it
to
Lord
Masham
:
 
if
it
be
a
bargain
,
I
'll
keep
it
to
myself
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
my
conscience

<EOS>
But
I
made
Pratt
buy
several
pictures
for
Lord
Masham
.
 
<EOS>
Pratt
is
a
great
virtuoso
that
way

<EOS>
I
dined
with
Lord
Treasurer
,
but
made
him
go
to
Court
at
eight

<EOS>
I
always
tease
him
to
be
gone
.
 
<EOS>
I
thought
to
have
made
Parnell
dine
with
him
,
but
he
was
ill

his

is
out

like
mine

<EOS>
I
was
at
Lord

talked
gravely
to
me
of
not
seeing
the
Irish
bishops
here
,

the
Irish
gentlemen
;

I
believe
my

fretted
him

I
would

though
it
was
Saturday
<EOS>
(

went

There

He
showed
me
some
of

speech

which
I
corrected
in
several
places

and
penned
the
vote
of
address
of
thanks
for
the
speech

but
I
was
of
opinion
the
House
should
not
sit
on
Tuesday
next
,
unless
they
hear
the
peace
is
signed

that
is
,
provided

Lord

would
have
had

dine

to

day

he
desired
me
last
night
,
but
I
refused
,
because
he
would
not
keep
the
day
of
his
stabbing
with
all
the
Cabinet
,
as
he
intended
:
 
<EOS>
so
I
dined
with
my

the
Provost
and
Parnell

and
Ford

At

Lewis
brought

word

I

they
are
sure
of
the
peace

then
they
are
right
in
my
opinion

otherwise
I
think
they
have
done
wrong

might
have
sat
three
weeks

we
did
some
business
.
 
<EOS>
Our
printer
was
to
attend
us
,
as
usual
;
and
the
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
sent
the
author
of
the
Examiner
twenty
guineas
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
an
ingenious
fellow
,
but
the
most
confounded
vain
coxcomb
in
the
world
,
so
that
I
dare
not
let
him
see
me
,
nor
am
acquainted
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
much
discourse
with
the
Duke
of
Ormond
this
morning
,
and
am
driving
some
points
to
secure
us
all
in
case
of
accidents
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
I
left
the
Society
at
seven
.
 
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
drink
now
at
all
with
any
pleasure
.
 
<EOS>
I
love
white
Portugal
wine
better
than
claret
,
champagne
,
or
burgundy
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
sad
vulgar
appetite
.
 
<EOS>
I
remember
Ppt
used
to
maunder
,
when
I
came
from
a
great
dinner
,
and
DD
had
<EOS>
but
a
bit
of
mutton
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
endure
above
one
dish
;
nor
ever
could
since
I
was
a
boy
,
and
loved
stuffing
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
fine
day
,
which
is
a
rarity
with
us
<EOS>

I
assure
[

<EOS>
Never

I
had
a
rabble
of
Irish
parsons
this
morning
drinking
my
chocolate
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
remember
appointments
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
to
have
supped
last
night
with
the
Swedish
Envoy
at
his
house
,
and
some
other
company
,
but
forgot
it
;
and
he
rallied
me
to
-
day
at
Lord
Bolingbroke
's
,
who
excused
me
,
saying
,
the
Envoy
ought
not
to
be
angry
,
because
I
serve
Lord
Treasurer
and
him
the
same
way
.
<EOS>
For
that
reason
,
I
very
seldom
promise
to
go
anywhere
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
with
Lord
Treasurer
,
who
chid
me
for
being
absent
so
long
,
as
he
always
does
if
I
miss
a
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
sat
three
hours
this
evening
with
Lady
Jersey
;
but
the
first
two
hours
she
was
at
ombre
with
some
company
.
 
<EOS>
I
left
Lord
Treasurer
at
eight
:
 
<EOS>
I
fancied
he
was
a
little
thoughtful
,
for
he
was
playing
with
an
orange
by
fits
,
which
,
I
told
him
,
among
common
men
looked
like
the
spleen
.
 
<EOS>
This
letter
shall
not
go
to
-
morrow
;
no
haste
,
ung
oomens
;
nothing
that
presses
.
 
<EOS>
I
promised
but
once
in
three
weeks
,
and
I
am
better
than
my
word
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
the
peace
may
be
ready
,
I
mean
that
we
have
notice
it
is
signed
,
before
Tuesday
;
otherwise
the
grumbling
will
much
increase
.

It
was
a
lovely
day
this
,
and
I
took
the
advantage
of
walking
a
good
deal
in
the
Park
,
before
I
went
to
Court
.
 
<EOS>
Colonel
Disney
,
one
of
our
Society
,
is
ill
of
a
fever
,
and
,
we
fear
,
in
great
danger
.
 
<EOS>
We
all
love
him
mightily
,
and
he
would
be
a
great
loss
.
 
<EOS>
I
doubt
I
shall
not
buy
the
library
;
for
a
roguey
bookseller
has
offered
sixty
pounds
more
than
I
designed
to
give
;
so
you
see
I
meant
to
have
a
good
bargain
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
with
Lord
Treasurer
and
his
Saturday
company
;
but
there
were
but
seven
at
table
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Peterborrow
is
ill
,
and
spits
blood
,
with
a
bruise
he
got
before
he
left
England
;
but
,
I
believe
,
an
Italian
lady
he
has
brought
over
is
the
cause
that
his
illness
returns
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
old
Lady
Bellasis
is
dead
at
last

<EOS>
She
has
left
Lord
Berkeley
of
Stratton
one
of
her
executors
,
and
it
will
be
of
great
advantage
to
him
;
they
say
above
ten
thousand
pounds
.
 
<EOS>
I
stayed
with
Lord
Treasurer
upon
business
,
after
the
company
was
gone
;
but
I
dare
not
tell
you
upon
what
.
 
<EOS>
My
letters
would
be
good
memoirs
,
if
I
durst
venture
to
say
a
thousand
things
that
pass
;
but
I
hear
so
much
of
letters
opening

again
to

I
had
ready
what
he
wanted

he
would

put

off

The
Queen
goes
to
chapel
now

<EOS>
She
is
carried
in
an
open
chair
,
and
will
be
well
enough
to
go
to
Parliament
on
Tuesday
,
if
the
Houses
meet
,
which
is
not
yet
certain
;
neither
,
indeed
,
can
the
Ministers
themselves
tell
;
for
it
depends
on
winds
and
weather
,
and
circumstances
of
negotiation

<EOS>
However
,
we
go
on
as
if
it
was
certainly
to
meet
;
and
I
am
to
be
at
Lord
Treasurer
's
to

morrow
,
upon
that
supposition
,
to
settle
some
things
relating
that
way

he
told

the

prorogued
till

<EOS>
They
have
had
some
expresses
,
by
which
they
count
that
the
peace
may
be
signed
by
that
time

at

,
that
France

Holland
,
and
we
,
will
sign
some
articles
,
by
which
we
shall
engage
to
sign
the
peace
when
it
is
ready

but
Spain
has
no
Minister
there
;
for
Monteleon
,
who
is
to
be
their
Ambassador
at
Utrecht
,
is
not
yet
gone
from
hence
;
and
till
he
is
there
,
the
Spaniards
can
sign
no
peace
:
 
and
[
of
]
one
thing
take
notice
,
that
a
general
peace
can
hardly
be
finished
these
two
months
,
so
as
to
be
proclaimed
here
;
for
,
after
signing
,
it
must
be
ratified
;
that
is
,
confirmed
by
the
several
princes
at
their
Courts
,
which
to
Spain
will
cost
a
month
;
for
we
must
have
notice
that
it
is
ratified
in
all
Courts
before
we
can
proclaim
it

The

were
disappointed
that

not
meet
to

it

I

there

asked

None

But
Sir

told
him
the
pun

find
he
has
been

Halifax

with
four
principal
Whigs

but
he
is
resolved
to
begin
a
speech
against
them
when
the
Parliament
sits
;
and
I
have
begged
that
the
Ministers
may
have
a
meeting
on
purpose
to
settle
that
matter
,
and
let
us
be
the
attackers
;
and
I
believe
it
will
come
to
something
,
for
the
Whigs
intend
to
attack
the
Ministers
:

if
,
instead
of
that
,
the
Ministers
attack
the
Whigs
,
it
will
be
better

I

we
shall
attack
them
on

declare
for
it
after
the
peace

<EOS>
Annesley
said
twenty
people
had
told
him
this
.
 
<EOS>
You
must
know
this
is
what
they
endeavour
to
report
of
Lord
Treasurer
,
that
he
designs
to
declare
for
the
Whigs
;
and
a
Scotch
fellow
has
wrote
the
same
to
Scotland
;
and
his
meeting
with
those
lords
gives
occasion
to
such
reports
.
 
<EOS>
Let
me
henceforth
call
Lord
Treasurer
Eltee
,
because
possibly
my
letters
may
be
opened
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
remember
Eltee

I
dined
to
-
day
at
Sir
Thomas
Hanmer
's
,
by
an
old
appointment
:
 
there
was
the
Duke
of
Ormond
,
and
Lord
and
Lady
Orkney
.
 
<EOS>
I
left
them
at
six
.
 
<EOS>
Everybody
is
as
sour
as
vinegar
.
 
<EOS>
I
endeavour
to
keep
a
firm
friendship
between
the
Duke
of
Ormond
and
Eltee
.
 
<EOS>
(
Oo
know
who
Eltee
is
,
or
have
oo
fordot
already
?
)
 
<EOS>
I
have
great
designs
,
if
I
can
compass
them
;
but
delay
is
rooted
in
Eltee
's
heart
;
yet
the
fault
is
not
altogether
there
,
that
things
are
no
better
.
 
<EOS>
Here
is
<EOS>
the
cursedest
libel
in
verse
come
out
that
ever
was
seen
,
called
The
Ambassadress
;
it
is
very
dull
,
too
;
it
has
been
printed
three
or
four
different
ways
,
and
is
handed
about
,
but
not
sold
.
 
<EOS>
It
abuses
the
Queen
horribly
.
 
<EOS>
The
Examiner
has
cleared
me
to

day
of
being
author
of
his
paper
,
and
done
it
with
great
civilities
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
it
will
stop
people
's
mouths

if
not

they
must
go
on

be

It

in

<EOS>
I
went
to
Colonel
Disney
,
who
is
past

.
 
<EOS>
Then
I
visited
Lord
Keeper
,
who
was
at
dinner
;
but
I
would
not
dine
with
him
,
but
drove
to
Lord
Treasurer
(
<EOS>
Eltee
I
mean
)
,
paid
the
coachman
,
and
went
in
;
but
he
dined
abroad
:
 
<EOS>
so
I
was
forced
to
call
the
coachman
again
,
and
went
to
Lord
Bolingbroke
's
.
 
<EOS>
He
dined
abroad
too
;
and
at
Lord
Dupplin
's
I
alighted
,
and
by
good
luck
got
a
dinner
there
,
and
then
went
to
the
Latin
play
at
Westminster
School
,
acted
by
the
boys
;
and
Lord
Treasurer
(
Eltee
I
mean
again
)
honoured
them
with
his
presence
.

Lady
Masham
's
eldest
son

about

I

Our
peace
will
certainly
be
ready
by
Thursday
fortnight
;
but
our
Plenipotentiaries
were
to
blame
that
it
was
not
done
already
.
 
<EOS>
They
thought
their
powers
were
not
full
enough
to
sign
the
peace
,
unless
every
Prince
was
ready
,
which
can
not
yet
be
;
for
Spain
has
no
Minister
yet
at
Utrecht

now
ours
have
new

Weather
worse

terrible
rain
all

I
was
resolved
I
would
spend
no
more
money

<EOS>
I
went
to
an
auction
of
pictures
with
Dr.
Pratt
,
and
there
met
the
Duke
of
Beaufort
,
who
promised
to
come
with
me
to
Court
,
but
did
not
.
 
<EOS>
So
a
coach
I
got
,
and
went
to
Court
,
and
did
some
little
business
there
,
but
was
forced
to
go
home
;
for
oo
must
understand
I
take
a
little
physic
over

<EOS>
I
thought
to
have
dined
with
Eltee
,
but
would
not
,
merely
to
save
a
shilling
;
but
I
dined
privately
with
a
friend
,
and
played
at
ombre

and
won
six
shillings

The
Bishop
of
Clogher
has
bought

and
Dr.

has
got
him
very
good
pennyworths

I
can

Though
it
was
shaving

head
and

,
yet
I
was
out
early
to
see
Lord
Bolingbroke
,
and
talk
over
affairs
with
him
;
and
then
I
went
to
the
Duke
of
Ormond
's
,
and
so
to
Court
,
where
the
Ministers
did
not
come
,
because
the
Parliament
was
prorogued
till
this
day

We
had
terrible

Our
Society
met
this
day
,
but
I
left
them
before
seven
,
and
went
to
Sir
A[ndrew

F[ountaine
]
,
and
played
at
ombre
with
him
and
Sir
Thomas
Clarges
,
till

and
then
went
to
Sir
Thomas
Hanmer
.
 
<EOS>
His
wife
,
the
Duchess
of
Grafton
,
left
us
after
a
little
while
,
and
I
stayed
with
him
about
an
hour
,
upon
some
affairs
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Bolingbroke
left
us
at
the
Society
before
I
went
;
for
there
is
an
express
from
Utrecht
,
but
I
know
not
yet
what
it
contains
;
only
I
know
the
Ministers
expect
the
peace
will
be
signed
in
a
week
,
which
is
a

I

<EOS>
poor
Harrison

mother
;
you
would
laugh
to
see
how
cautious
I
am
of
paying
her
the
100
pounds
I
received
for
her
son
from
the
Treasury
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
asked
every
creature
<EOS>
I
know
whether
I
may
do
it
safely
,
yet
durst
not
venture
,
till
my
Lord
Keeper
assured
me
there
was
no
danger
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
paid
her
,
but
will
in
a
day
or
two
:
 
though
I
have
a
great
mind
to
stay
till
<EOS>
Ppt
sends
me
her
opinion
,
because
Ppt
is
a
great
lawyer
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
to
-
day
with
a
mixture
of
people
at
a
Scotchman
's
,
who
made
the
invitation
to
Mr.
Lewis
and
me
,
and
has
some
design
upon
us
,
which
we
know
very
well
.
 
<EOS>
I
went
afterwards
to
see
a
famous
moving
picture
,
and
I
never
saw
anything
so
pretty
.
 
<EOS>
You
see

except
about
half
a
dozen

and
they
were
all
here

and
Mr.

was
one
,

I
had

I

his
Saturday
company
,
as
usual
,
and
could
not
get
away
till
nine
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Peterborow
was
making
long
harangues
,
and
Eltee
kept
me
in
spite
.
 
<EOS>
Then
I
went
to
see
the
Bishop
of
Ossory
,
who
had
engaged
me
in
the
morning
;
he
is
going
to
Ireland
.
 
<EOS>
The
Bishop
of
Killaloe
and
Tom
Leigh
was
with
us
.
 
<EOS>
The
latter
had
wholly
changed
his
style
,
by
seeing
how
the
bishops
behaved
themselves
,
and
he
seemed
to
think
me
one
of
more
importance
than
I
really
am
.
 
<EOS>
I
put
the
ill
conduct
of
the
bishops
about
the
First
-
Fruits
,
with
relation
to
Eltee
and
me
,
strongly
upon
Killaloe
,
and
showed
how
it
had
hindered
me
from
getting
a
better
thing
for
them
,
called
the
Crown
rents
,
which
the
Queen
had
promised
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
nothing
to
say
,
but
was
humble
,
and
desired
my
interest
in
that
and
some
other
things
.

<EOS>
I
have
been
employed
in
endeavouring
to
save
one
of
your
junior
Fellows
,
who
came
over
here
for
a
dispensation
from
taking
orders
,
and
,
in
soliciting
it
,
has
run
out
his
time
,
and
now
his
fellowship
is
void
,
if
the
College
pleases
,
unless
the
Queen
suspends
the
execution
,
and
gives
him
time
to
take
orders
.
 
<EOS>
I
spoke
to
all
the
Ministers
yesterday
about
it
;
but
they
say
the
Queen
is
angry
,
and
thought
it
was
a
trick
to
deceive
her
;
and
she
is
positive
,
and
so
the
man
must
be
ruined
,
for
I
can
not
help
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
saw
him
in
my
life
;
but
the
case
was
so
hard
,
I
could
not
forbear
interposing
.
<EOS>
Your
Government
recommended
him
to
the
Duke
of
Ormond
,
and
he
thought
they
would
grant
it
;
and
by
the
time
it
was
refused
,
the
fellowship
by
rigour
is
forfeited
.
 
<EOS>
I
dined
with
Dr.
Arbuthnot
(
one
of
my
brothers
)
at
his
lodgings
in
Chelsea
,
and
was
there
at
chapel
;
and
the
altar
put
me
in
mind
of
Tisdall
's
outlandish
would
at
your
hospital
for
the
soldiers
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
not
at
Court
to
-
day
,
and
I
hear
the
Queen
was
not
at
church
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
the
gout
has
seized
her
again
.

<EOS>
I
was
naming
some
time
ago
,
to
a
certain
person
,
another
certain
person
,
that
was
very
deserving
,
and
poor
and
sickly
;
and
t'other
,
that
first
certain
person
,
gave
me
a
hundred
pounds
to
give
the
other
,
which
I
have
not
yet
done
.
 
<EOS>
The
person
who
is
to
have
it
never
saw
the
giver
,
nor
expects
one
farthing
,
nor
has
the
least
knowledge
or
imagination
of
it
;
so
I
believe
it
will
be
a
very
agreeable
surprise
;
for
I
think
it
is
a
handsome
present
enough
.
 
<EOS>
At
night
I
dined
in
the
City
,
at
Pontack
's
,
with
Lord
Dupplin
,
and
some
others
.
 
<EOS>
We
were
treated
by
one
Colonel
Cleland
,
who
has
a
mind
to
be
Governor
of
Barbados
,
and
is
laying
these
long
traps
for
me
and
others
,
to
engage
our
interests
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
a
true
Scotchman
.
 
<EOS>
I
paid
the
hundred
pounds
this
evening
,
and
it
was
an
agreeable
surprise
to
the
receiver
.
<EOS>
We
reckon
the
peace
is
now
signed
,
and
that
we
shall
have
it
in
three
days
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
it
is
pretty
sure

I
was
acquainted
with
the
steward
,
when
I
was
giving
myself
airs
of
being
at
some
lord

house

<EOS>
Sir
Andrew
Fountaine
invited
the
Bishop
of
Clogher
and
me
,
and
some
others
,
to
dine
where
he
did
;
and
he
carried
us
to
the
Duke
of
Kent
's
,
who
was
gone
out
of
town
;
but
the
steward
treated
us
nobly
,
and
showed
us
the
fine
pictures
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
yet
seen
Miss
Ashe

<EOS>
I
wait
till
she
has
been
abroad

and
taken
the
air

This
evening
Lady
Masham
,
Dr.
Arbuthnot
,
and
I
,
were
contriving
a
lie
for
to

morrow
,
that
Mr.
Noble
,
who
was
hanged
last
Saturday
,
was
recovered
by
his
friends
,
and
then
seized
again
by
the
sheriff
,
and
is
now
in
a
messenger
's
hands
at
the
Black
Swan
in
Holborn
.
 
<EOS>
We
are
all
to
send
to
our
friends
,
to
know
whether
they
have
heard
anything
of
it
,
and
so
we
hope
it
will
spread
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
we
shall
do
our
endeavours
;
nothing
shall
be
wanting
on
our
parts

and
leave
the
rest
to
fortune

We
had
no
success
in
our

though
I
sent
my
man
to
several
houses
,
to
inquire
among
the
footmen
,
without
letting
him
into
the
secret
;
but
I
doubt
my
colleagues
did
not
contribute
as
they
ought

Parnell

I
dined
with

to

You

told

After
dinner
we
all
went
to
Lord
Bolingbroke
's
,
who
had
desired
me
to
dine
with
him
;
but
I
would
not
,
because
I
heard
it
was
to
look
over
a
dull
poem
of
one
parson
Trapp
upon
the
peace
.
 
<EOS>
The
Swedish
Envoy
told
me
to
-
day
at
Court
that
he
was
in
great
apprehensions
about
his
master
;
and
indeed
we
are
afraid
that
prince
has
died
among
those
Turkish
dogs
.
 
<EOS>
I
prevailed
on
Lord
Bolingbroke
to
invite
Mr.
Addison
to
dine
with
him
on
Good
Friday
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
we
shall
be
mighty
mannerly
.
 
<EOS>
Addison
is
to
have
a
play
of
his
acted
on
Friday
in
Easter
Week
:
 
'
tis
a
tragedy
,
called
Cato
;
I
saw
it
unfinished
some
years
ago
.
 
<EOS>
Did
I
tell
you
that
Steele
has
begun
a
new
daily
paper
,
called
the
Guardian
?
<EOS>
they
say
good
for
nothing
.

I
was
this
morning
with
Lord
Bolingbroke
,
and
he
tells
me
a
Spanish
courier
is
just
come
,
with
the
news
that
the
King
of
Spain
has
agreed
to
everything
that
the
Queen
desires
;
and
the
Duke
d'Ossuna
has
left
Paris
in
order
to
his
journey
to
Utrecht
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
prevailed
on
to
come
home
with
Trapp
,
and
read
his
poem
and
correct
it
;
but
it
was
good
for
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
While
I
was
thus
employed
,
Sir
Thomas
Hanmer
came
up
to
my
chamber
,
and
balked
me
of
a
journey
<EOS>
he
and
I
intended
this
week
to
Lord
Orkney
's
at
Cliffden
;
but
he
is
not
well
,
and
his
physician
will
not
let
him
undertake
such
a
journey
.
 
<EOS>
I
intended
to
dine
with
Lord
Treasurer
;
but
going
to
see
Colonel
Disney
,
who
lives
with
General
Withers
<EOS>
,
I
liked
the
General
's
little
dinner
so
well
,
that
I
stayed
and
took
share
of
it
,
and
did
not
go
to
Lord
Treasurer
till
six
,
where
I
found
Dr.
Sacheverell
,
who
told
us
that
the
bookseller
had
given
him
100
pounds
for
his
sermon
,
preached
last
Sunday
,
and
intended
to
print
30,000
:
 
<EOS>
I
believe
he
will
be
confoundedly
bit
,
and
will
hardly
sell
above
half
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
fires
still
,
though
April
has
begun
,
against
my
old
maxim
;
but
the
weather
is
wet
and
cold
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
saw
such
a
long
run
of
ill
weather
in
my
life

<EOS>
Mr.
St.
John
,
Lord
Bolingbroke
's
brother
,
came
this
day
at
noon
with
an
express
from
Utrecht
,
that
the
peace
is
signed
by
all
the
Ministers
there
,
but
those
of
the
Emperor
,
who
will
likewise
sign
in
a
few
days
;
so
that
now
the
great
work
is
in
effect
done
,
and
I
believe
it
will
appear
a
most
excellent
peace
for
Europe
,
particularly
for
England
.
 
<EOS>
Addison
and
I
,
and
some
others
,
dined
with
Lord
Bolingbroke
,
and
sat
with
him
till
twelve
.
 
<EOS>
We
were
very
civil
,
but
yet
when
we
grew
warm
,
we
talked
in
a
friendly
manner
of
party
.
 
<EOS>
Addison
raised
his
objections
,
and
Lord
Bolingbroke
answered
them
with
great
complaisance
.
<EOS>
Addison
began
Lord
Somers
's
health
,
which
went
about
;
but
I
bid
him
not
name
Lord
Wharton
's
,
for
I
would
not
pledge
it
;
and
I
told
Lord
Bolingbroke
frankly
that
Addison
loved
Lord
Wharton
as
little
as
I
did
:
 
<EOS>
so
we
laughed
,
<EOS>
etc
.
<EOS>
Well
,
but
you
are
glad
of
the
peace
,
you
Ppt
the
Trimmer
,
are
not
you
?
 
<EOS>
As
for
DD
I
do
n't
doubt
her
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
now
,
if
I
did
not
think
Ppt
had
been
a
violent
Tory
,
and
DD
the
greater
Whig
of

This
Passion
Week
,
people
are
so
demure
,
especially
this
last
day
,
that
I
told
Dilly
,
who
called
here
,
that
I
would
dine
with
him
,
and
so
I
did
,
faith
;
and
had
a
small
shoulder
of
mutton
of
my
own
bespeaking
.
 
<EOS>
It
rained
all
day
.
<EOS>
I
came
home
at
seven
,
and
have
never
stirred
out
,
but
have
been
reading
Sacheverell
's
long
dull
sermon
,
which
he
sent
me
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
the
first
sermon
since
his
suspension
is
expired
;
but
not
a
word
in
it
upon
the
occasion
,
except
two
or
three
remote
hints
.
 
<EOS>
The
Bishop
of
Clogher
has
been
sadly
bit
by
Tom
Ashe
,
who
sent
him
a
pun
,
which
the
Bishop
had
made
,
and
designed
to
send
to
him
,
but
delayed
it
;
and
Lord
Pembroke
and
<EOS>
I
made
Sir
Andrew
Fountaine
write
it
to
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
I
told
you
of
it
in
my
last
;
it
succeeded
right
,
and
the
Bishop
was
wondering
to
Lord
Pembroke
how
he
and
his
brother
could
hit
on
the
same
thing
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
go
to
bed
soon
,
for
I
must
be
at
church
by
eight
to
-
morrow
,
Easter
Day

Warburton
wrote
to
me
two
letters
about
a
living
of
one
Foulkes
,
who
is
lately
dead
in
the
county
of
Meath
.
 
<EOS>
My
answer
is
,
that
before
I
received
the
first
letter
,
General
Gorges
had
recommended
a
friend
of
his
to
the
Duke
of
Ormond
,
which
was
the
first
time
I
heard
of
its
vacancy
,
and
it
was
the
Provost
told
me
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
verily
that
Foulkes
was
not
dead
when
Gorges
recommended
the
other
:
 
for
Warburton
's
last
letter
said
that
Foulkes
was
dead
the
day
before
the
date
.
 
<EOS>
This
has
prevented
me
from
serving
Warburton
,
as
I
would
have
done
,
if
I
had
received
early
notice
enough
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
say
or
write
this
to
Warburton
,
to
justify
me
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
at
church
at
eight
this
morning
,
and
dressed
and
shaved
after
I
came
back
,
but
was
too
late
at
Court
;
and
Lord
Abingdon
was
like
to
have
snapped
me
for
dinner
,
and
I
believe
will
fall
out
with
me
for
refusing
him
;
but
I
hate
dining
with
them
,
and
I
dined
with
a
private
friend
,
and
took
two
or
three
good
walks
;
for
it
was
a
very
fine
day
,
the
first
we
have
had
a
great
while
.
 
<EOS>
Remember
,
was
Easter
Day
a

I
was
this

at

at
the
rehearsal
of
Mr.
Addison
's
play
,
called
Cato
,
which
is
to
be
acted
on
Friday
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
not
above
half
a
score
of
us
to
see
it
.
 
<EOS>
We
stood
on
the
stage
,
and
it
was
foolish
enough
to
see
the
actors
prompted
every
moment
,
and
<EOS>
the
poet
directing
them
;
and
the
drab
that
acts
Cato
's
daughter
,
out
in
the
midst
of
a
passionate
part
,
and
then
calling
out
,
"
What
's
next
?
"
 
<EOS>
The
Bishop
of
Clogher
was
there
too
;
but
he
stood
privately
in
a
gallery
.
 
<EOS>
I
went
to
dine
with
Lord
Treasurer
,
but
he
was
gone
to
Wimbledon
,
his
daughter
Caermarthen
's
country
seat
,
seven
miles
off
.
<EOS>
So
I
went
back
,
and
dined
privately
with
Mr.
Addison
,
whom
I
had
left
to
go
to
Lord
Treasurer
.
 
<EOS>
I
keep
fires
yet

I
am
very
extravagant

I
sat
this

O
pray
tell
Swanton
<EOS>
I
had
his
letter
,
but
can
not
contrive
how
to
serve
him

<EOS>
If
a
Governor
were
to
go

I
would
recommend
him
as
far
as
lay
in
my
power

I
can

and
<EOS>
you
know
all

in

at

almost
all

<EOS>
If
I
were
on

and
had
credit
with
a
Lord
Lieutenant
,
I
would
very
heartily
recommend

answered

I
was
this

with
Lord

to
present
to
him
a
young
son
of
the
late
Earl
of
Jersey
,
at
the
desire
of
the
widow

<EOS>
There
I
saw
the
mace
and
great
coach
ready
for
Lord
Treasurer
,
who
was
going
to
Parliament
.
 
<EOS>
Our
Society
met
to
-
day
;
but
I
expected
the
Houses
would
sit
longer
than
I
cared
to
fast
;
so
I
dined
with
a
friend
,
and
never
inquired
how
matters
went
till
eight
this
evening
,
when
I
went
to
Lord
Orkney
's
,
where
I
found
Sir
Thomas
Hanmer
.
<EOS>
The
Queen
delivered
her
speech
very
well
,
but
a
little
weaker
in
her
voice
.
<EOS>
The
crowd
was
vast
.
 
<EOS>
The
order
for
the
Address
was
moved
,
and
opposed
by
Lord
Nottingham
,
Halifax
,
and
Cowper
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Treasurer
spoke
with
great
spirit
and
resolution
;
Lord
Peterborow
flirted
against
the
Duke
of
Marlborough
(
who
is
in
Germany
,
you
know
)
,
but
it
was
in
answer
to
one
of
Halifax
's
impertinences
.
 
<EOS>
The
order
for
an
Address
passed
by
a
majority
of
thirty
-
three
,
and
the
Houses
rose
before
six
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
the
account
I
heard
at
Lord
Orkney
's
.
<EOS>
The
Bishop
of
Chester
,
a
high
Tory
,
was
against
the
Court
.
 
<EOS>
The
Duchess
of
Marlborough
sent
for
him
some
months
ago
,
to
justify
herself
to
him
in
relation
to
the
Queen
,
and
showed
him
letters
,
and
told
him
stories
,
which
the
weak
man
believed
,
and
was
perverted
.

This
Parliament

time
hinders
our
Court
meetings
on
Wednesdays

Thursdays

and
Saturdays

<EOS>
I
had
a
great
deal
of
business
to
-
night
,
which
gave
me
a
temptation
to
be
idle
,
and
I
lost
a
dozen
shillings
at
ombre
,
with
Dr.
Pratt
and
another
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
to
see
t'other
day
the
Bishop
of
Clogher
and
lady
,
but
did
not
see
Miss.

It
rains

Lady
Masham
's
eldest
boy
is
very
ill
:
 
<EOS>
I
doubt
he
will
not
live
,
and
she
stays
at
Kensington
to
nurse
him
,
which
vexes
us
all
.
 
<EOS>
She
is
so
excessively
fond
<EOS>
,
it
makes
me
mad
.
 
<EOS>
She
should
never
leave
the
Queen
,
but
leave
everything
,
to
stick
to
what
is
so
much
the
interest
of
the
public
,
as
well
as
her
own
.

her

Lord

,
with
his
Saturday
company

We
had
ten
at
table
,
all
lords
but
myself
and
the
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
.
 
<EOS>
Argyle
went
off
at
six
,
and
was
in
very
indifferent
humour
as
usual
.
 
<EOS>
Duke
of
Ormond
and
Lord
Bolingbroke
were
absent
.
 
<EOS>
I
stayed
till
near
ten
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Treasurer
showed
us
a
small
picture
,
enamelled
work
,
and
set
in
gold
,
worth
about
twenty
pounds
;
a
picture
,
I
mean
,
of
the
Queen
,
which
she
gave
to
the
Duchess
of
Marlborough
,
set
in
diamonds
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
Duchess
was
leaving
England
,
she
took
off
all
the
diamonds
,
and
gave
the
picture
to
one
Mrs.
Higgins
(
an
old
intriguing
woman
,
whom
everybody
knows
)
,
bidding
her
make
the
best
of
it
she
could
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Treasurer
sent
to
Mrs.
Higgins
for
this
picture
,
and
gave
her
a
hundred
pounds
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
Was
ever
such
an
ungrateful
beast
as
that
Duchess
?
<EOS>
or
did
you
ever
hear
such
a
story
?
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
the
Whigs
will
not
believe
it
.
<EOS>
Pray
,
try
them
.
 
<EOS>
Takes
off
the
diamonds
,
and
gives
away
the
picture
to
an
insignificant
woman
,
as
a
thing
of
no
consequence
:
 
and
gives
it
to
her
to
sell
,
like
a
piece
of
old

fashioned
plate
.

Is
she
not
a
detestable
slut
?

I
went
to
Court

on
purpose
to
present
Mr.
Berkeley
,
one
of
your
Fellows
of
Dublin
College
,
to
Lord
Berkeley
of
Stratton
.
 
<EOS>
That
Mr.
Berkeley
is
a
very
ingenious
man
,
and
great
philosopher
,
and
I
have
mentioned
him
to
all
the
Ministers
,
and
given
them
some
of
his
writings
;
and
I
will
favour
him
as
much
as
I
can
.
 
<EOS>
This
<EOS>
I
think
I
am
bound
to
,
in
honour
and
conscience
,
to
use
all
my
little
credit
toward
helping
forward
men
of
worth
in
the
world

<EOS>
The
Queen
was
at
chapel
to

I
dined

Lord
Orkney

Lord
Arran

and
Sir
Thomas
Hanmer

<EOS>
Mr.
St.
John

Secretary
at
Utrecht

expects
every

to
return
there
with
the
ratification
of
the
peace

<EOS>
Did
I
tell
you
in
my
last
of
Addison

play
called
Cato
,
and
that
I
was
at
the
rehearsal
of
it

This
morning
my
friend
,
Mr.
Lewis
,
came
to
me
,
and
showed
me
an
order
for
a
warrant
for
the
three
vacant
deaneries
;
but
none
of
them
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
what
I
always
foresaw
,
and
received
the
notice
of
it
better
,
I
believe
,
than
he
expected
.
 
<EOS>
I
bid
Mr.
Lewis
tell
Lord
Treasurer
that
I
took
nothing
ill
of
him
but
his
not
giving
me
timely
notice
,
as
he
promised
to
do
,
if
he
found
the
Queen
would
do
nothing
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
At
noon
,
Lord
Treasurer
hearing
I
was
in
Mr.
Lewis
's
office
,
came
to
me
,
and
said
many
things
too
long
to
repeat
.
 
<EOS>
I
told
him
I
had
nothing
to
do
but
go
to
Ireland
immediately
;
for
I
could
not
,
with
any
reputation
,
stay
longer
here
,
unless
I
had
something
honourable
immediately
given
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
We
dined
together
at
the
Duke
of
Ormond
's
.
 
<EOS>
He
there
told
me
he
had
stopped
the
warrants
for
the
deans
,
that
what
was
done
for
me
might
be
at
the
same
time
,
and
he
hoped
to
compass
it
to
-
night
;
but
I
believe
him
not
.
 
<EOS>
I
told
the
Duke
of
Ormond
<EOS>
my
intentions
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
content
Sterne
should
be
a
bishop
,
and
I
have
St.
Patrick
's
;
but
I
believe
nothing
will
come
of
it
,
for
stay
I
will
not
;
and
so
I
believe
for
all
oo
.
.
.
 
<EOS>
oo
may
see
me
in
Dublin
before
April
ends
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
less
out
of
humour
than
you
would
imagine
:
 
and
if
it
were
not
that
impertinent
people
will
condole
with
me
,
as
they
used
to
give
me
joy
,
I
would
value
it
less
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
will
avoid
company
,
and
muster
up
my
baggage
,
and
send
them
next
Monday
by
the
carrier
to
Chester
,
and
come
and
see
my
willows
,
against
the
expectation
of
all
the

I
dined
in

and
ordered
a
lodging
to
be
got
ready
for
me
against
I
<EOS>
came
to
pack
up
my
things
;
for
I
will
leave
this
end
of
the
town
as
soon
as
ever
the
warrants
for
the
deaneries
are
out
,
which
are
yet
stopped
.
<EOS>
Lord
Treasurer
told
Mr.
Lewis
that
it
should
be
determined
to
-
night
:
 
and
so
he
will
for
a
hundred
nights
.
 
<EOS>
So
he
said
yesterday
,
<EOS>
but
I
value
it
not

<EOS>
My
daily
journals
shall
be
but
short
till
I
get
into
the
City
,
and
then
I
will
send
away
this
,
and
follow
it
myself
;
and
design
to
walk
it
all
the
way
to
Chester
,
my
man
and
I
,
by
ten
miles
a
day

<EOS>
It

Lord
Bolingbroke
made
me
dine
with
him
to

day
;
he
was
as
good
company
as
ever
;
and
told
me
the
Queen
would
determine
something
for
me
to
-
night
.
 
<EOS>
The
dispute
is
,
Windsor
or
St.
Patrick
's
.
 
<EOS>
I
told
him
I
would
not
stay
for
their
disputes
,
and
he
thought
I
was
in
the
right
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Masham
told
me
that
Lady
Masham
is
angry
I
have
not
been
to
see
her
since
this
business
,
and
desires
I
will
come
to

<EOS>
I
was
this
noon
at
Lady
Masham
's
,
who
was
just
come
from
Kensington
,
where
her
eldest
son
is
sick
.
 
<EOS>
She
said
much
to
me
of
what
she
had
talked
to
the
Queen
and
Lord
Treasurer
.
 
<EOS>
The
poor
lady
fell
a
shedding
tears
openly
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
bear
to
think
of
my
having
St.
Patrick
's
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
never
more
moved
than
to
see
so
much
friendship
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
not
stay
with
her
,
but
went
and
dined
with
Dr.
Arbuthnot
,
with
Mr.
Berkeley
,
one
of
your
Fellows
,
whom
I
have
recommended
to
the
Doctor
,
and
to
Lord
Berkeley
of
Stratton
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Lewis
tells
me
that
the
Duke
of
Ormond
has
been
to
-
day
with
the
Queen
;
and
she
was
content
that
Dr.
Sterne
should
be
Bishop
of
Dromore
,
and
I
Dean
of
St.
Patrick
's
;
but
then
out
came
Lord
Treasurer
,
and
said
he
would
not
be
satisfied
but
that
I
must
be
Prebend[ary
]
of
Windsor
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
he
perplexes
things
.
 
<EOS>
I
expect
neither
;
but
I
confess
,
as
much
as
I
love
England
,
I
am
so
angry
at
this
treatment
that
,
if
I
had
my
choice
,
I
would
rather
have
St.
Patrick
's
.
 
<EOS>
Lady
Masham
says
she
will
speak
to
purpose
to
the
Queen
to

<EOS>
I
went
to
dine
at
Lady
Masham
's
to

day
,
and
she
was
taken
ill
of
a
sore
throat
,
and
aguish
.
 
<EOS>
She
spoke
to
the
Queen
last
night
,
but
had
not
much
time
.
<EOS>
The
Queen
says
she
will
determine
to
-
morrow
with
Lord
Treasurer
.
 
<EOS>
The
warrants
for
the
deaneries
are
still
stopped
,
for
fear
I
should
be
gone
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
think
anything
will
be
done
?
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
care
whether
it
is
or
no
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
,
I
prepare
for
my
journey
,
and
see
no
great
people
,
nor
will
see
Lord
Treasurer
any
more
,
if
I
go
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Treasurer
told
Mr.
Lewis
it
should
be
done
to
-
night
;
so
he
said
five
nights
ago
.
 
<EOS>
Nite

<EOS>
This
morning
Mr.
Lewis
sent
me
word
that
Lord
Treasurer
told
him
the
Queen
would
determine
at
noon
.
 
<EOS>
At
three
Lord
Treasurer
sent
to
me
to
come
to
his
lodgings
at
St.
James
's
,
and
told
me
the
Queen
was
at
last
resolved
that
Dr.
Sterne
should
be
Bishop
of
Dromore
,
and
I
Dean
of
St.
Patrick
's
;
and
that
Sterne
's
warrant
should
be
drawn
immediately
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
the
deanery
is
in
the
Duke
of
Ormond
's
gift
;
but
this
is
concerted
between
the
Queen
,
Lord
Treasurer
,
and
the
Duke
of
Ormond
,
to
make
room
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
whether
it
will
yet
be
done
;
some
unlucky
accident
may
yet
come
.
 
<EOS>
Neither
<EOS>
can
I
feel
joy
at
passing
my
days
in
Ireland
;
and
I
confess
I
thought
the
Ministry
would
not
let
me
go
;
but
perhaps
they
ca
n't
help
it
.
 
<EOS>
Nite

<EOS>

.
 
<EOS>
I
forgot
to
tell
you
that
Lord
Treasurer
forced
me
to
dine
with
him
yesterday
as
usual
,
with
his
Saturday
company
;
which
I
did
after
frequent
refusals
.
 
<EOS>
To
-
day
I
dined
with
a
private
friend
,
and
was
not
at
Court
.
 
<EOS>
After
dinner
Mr.
Lewis
sent
me
a
note
,
that
the
Queen
stayed
till
she
knew
whether
the
Duke
of
Ormond
approved
of
Sterne
for
Bishop
.
 
<EOS>
I
went
this
evening
,
and
found
the
Duke
of
Ormond
at
the
Cock
-
pit
,
and
told
him
,
and
desired
he
would
go
to
the
Queen
,
and
approve
of
Sterne
.
 
<EOS>
He
made
objections
,
desired
I
would
name
any
other
deanery
,
for
he
did
not
like
Sterne
;
that
Sterne
never
went
to
see
him
;
that
he
was
influenced
by
the
Archbishop
of
Dublin
,
etc
.
;
so
all
now
is
broken
again
.
 
<EOS>
I
sent
out
for
Lord
Treasurer
,
and
told
him
this
.
 
<EOS>
He
says
all
will
do
well
;
but
I
value
not
what
he
says
.
 
<EOS>
This
suspense
vexes
me
worse

anything
else

the
Duke
of
Ormond

<EOS>
He
repeated
the
same
proposals
of
any
other
deanery
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
I
desired
he
would
put
me
out
of
the
case
,
and
do
as
he
pleased
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
with
great
kindness
,
he
said
he
would
consent
;
but
would
do
it
for
no
man
alive
but
me
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
And
he
will
speak
to
the
Queen
today
or
to

<EOS>
so
,
perhaps
,
something
will
come
of
it

he
is
satisfied
that
Sterne
should
be
Bishop

she
consents
I
shall
be
Dean

I
suppose
the
warrants
will
be
drawn
in
a

<EOS>
I
dined
at
an
ale

house

I
am
not

invited
me
to
dine
with
him
to

This

I
thought
I
was
to
pay
<EOS>
but
six
hundred
pounds
for
the
house
;
but
<EOS>
the
Bishop
of
Clogher
says
eight
hundred
pounds
;
first
-
fruits
one
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
,
and
so
,
with
patent
,
a
thousand
pounds
in
all
;
so
that
I
shall
not
be
the
better
for
the
deanery
these
three
years
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
in
some
time
they
will
be
persuaded
here
to
give
me
some
money
to
pay
off
these
debts
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
finish
the
book
I
am
writing
,
before
I
can
go
over
;
and
they
expect
I
shall
pass
next
winter
here
,
and
then
I
will
dun
them
to
give
me
a
sum
of
money
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
I
hope
to
pass
four
or
five
months
with
MD
,
and
whatever
comes
on
it
.
 
<EOS>
MD
's
allowance
must
be
increased
,

shall
be
too

just
ten

<EOS>

to

Sterne
.
 
<EOS>
Never
man
had
so
many
enemies
of
Ireland
as
he
.
 
<EOS>
I
carried
it
with
the
strongest
hand
possible
.
 
<EOS>
If
he
does
not
use
me
well
and
gently
in
what
dealings
I
shall
have
with
him
,
he
will
be
the
most
ungrateful
of
mankind
.
 
<EOS>
The
Archbishop
of
York
,
my
mortal
enemy
,
has
sent
,
by
a
third
hand
,
that
he
would
be
glad
to
see
me
.
 
<EOS>
Shall
I
see
him
,
or
not
?
 
<EOS>
I
hope
to
be
over
in
a
month
,
and
that
MD
,
with
their
raillery
,
will
be
mistaken
,
that
I
shall
make
it
three
years
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
answer
oo
rettle
soon
;
but
no
more
journals
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
be
very
busy
.
<EOS>
Short
letters
from
hence
forward

<EOS>
I
shall
not
part
with
Laracor
.
 
<EOS>
That
is
all
I
have
to
live
on
,
except
the
deanery
be
worth
more
than
four
hundred
pounds
a
year
.
 
<EOS>
Is
it
?
 
<EOS>
If
it
be
,
the
overplus
shall
be
divided
between
MD
and
FW
beside
usual
allowance
of
MD
.

<EOS>
Pray
write
to
me
a
good

humoured
letter
immediately
,
let
it
be
ever
so
short

<EOS>
This
affair
was
carried
with
great
difficulty
,
which
vexes
me
.
 
<EOS>
But
they
say
here
'
tis
much
to
my
reputation
that
I
have
made
a
bishop
,
in
spite
of
all
the

get

to

<EOS>
I
had
this
letter
all
day
in
my
pocket
,
waiting
till
I
heard
the
warrants
were
gone
over
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Lewis
sent
to
Southwell
's
clerk
at
ten
;
and
he
said
the
Bishop
of
Killaloe
had
desired
they
should
be
stopped
till
next
post
.
 
<EOS>
He
sent
again
,
that
the
Bishop
of
Killaloe
's
business
had
nothing
to
do
with
ours
.
<EOS>
Then
I
went
myself
,
but
it
was
past
eleven
,
and
asked
the
reason
.
 
<EOS>
Killaloe
is
removed
to
Raphoe
,
and
he
has
a
mind
to
have
an
order
for
the
rents
of
Raphoe
,
that
have
fallen
due
since
the
vacancy
,
and
he
would
have
all
stop
till
he
has
gotten
that
.
 
<EOS>
A
pretty
request
!
 
<EOS>
But
the
clerk
,
at
Mr.
Lewis
's
message
,
sent
the
warrants
for
Sterne
and
me
;
but
then
it
was
too
late
to
send
this
,
which
frets
me
heartily
,
that
MD
should
not
have
intelligence
first
from
Pdfr
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
to
take
a
hundred
pounds
a
year
out
of
the
deanery
,
and
divide
it
between
MD
and
Pr
,
and
so
be

in
paying
the

LONDON

<EOS>
I
had
yours
,
No
.
40
,
yesterday
.
 
<EOS>
Your
new
Bishop
acts
very
ungratefully
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
say
so
bad
of
it
as
he
deserved
.
 
<EOS>
I
begged
at
the
same
post
<EOS>
his
warrant
and
mine
went
over
,
that
he
would
leave
those
livings
to
my
disposal
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
write
this
post
to
him
to
let
him
know
how
ill
I
take
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
letters
to
tell
me
that
I
ought
to
think
of
employing
some
body
to
set
the
tithes
of
the
deanery
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
not
what
to
do
at
this
distance
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
be
in
Ireland
under
a
month
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
write
two
orders
;
one
to
Parvisol
,
and
t'other
to
Parvisol
,
and
a
blank
for
whatever
fellow
it
is
whom
the
last
Dean
employed
;
and
I
would
desire
you
to
advise
with
friends
which
to
make
use
of
:
 
and
<EOS>
if
the
latter
,
let
the
fellow
's
name
be
inserted
,
and
both
act
by
commission
.
 
<EOS>
If
the
former
,
then
speak
to
Parvisol
,
and
know
whether
he
can
undertake
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
doubt
it
is
hardly
to
be
done
by
a
perfect
stranger
alone
,
as
Parvisol
is
.
 
<EOS>
He
may
perhaps
venture
at
all
,
to
keep
up
his
interest
with
me
;
but
that
is
needless
,
for
I
am
willing
to
do
him
any
good
,
that
will
do
me
no
harm
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
advise
with
Walls
and
Raymond
,
and
a
little
with
Bishop
Sterne
for
form
.
 
<EOS>
Tell
Raymond
<EOS>
I
can
not
succeed
for
him
to
get
that
living
of
Moimed
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
represented
here
as
a
great
sinecure
.
 
<EOS>
Several
chaplains
have
solicited
for
it
;
and
it
has
vexed
me
so
,
that
,
if
I
live
,
I
will
make
it
my
business
to
serve
him
better
in
something
else
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
heartily
sorry
for
his
illness
,
and
that
of
the
other
two
.
 
<EOS>
If
it
be
not
necessary
to
let
the
tithes
till
a
month
hence
,
you
may
keep
the
two
papers
,
and
advise
well
in
the
meantime
;
and
whenever
it
is
absolutely
necessary
,
then
give
that
paper
which
you
are
most
advised
to
.
 
<EOS>
I
thank
Mr.
Walls
for
his
letter
.
 
<EOS>
Tell
him
that
must
serve
for
an
answer
,
with
my
service
to
him
and
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
buy
Bishop
Sterne
's
hair
as
soon
as
his
household
goods
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
be
ruined
,
or
at
least
sadly
cramped
,
unless
the
Queen
will
give
me
a
thousand
pounds
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
sure
she
owes
me
a
great
deal
more
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Treasurer
rallies
me
upon
it
,
and
I
believe
intends
it
;
but
,
quando
?
 
<EOS>
I
am
advised
to
hasten
over
as
soon
as
possible
,
and
so
I
will
,
and
hope
to
set
out
the
beginning
of
June
.
 
<EOS>
Take
no
lodging
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
What
?
<EOS>
at
your
old
tricks
again
?
 
<EOS>
I
can
lie
somewhere
after
I
land
,
and
I
care
not
where
,
nor
how
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
buy
your

DD

<EOS>
your

me
some

I
will
perform
them
as
far
as
oo
poo
<EOS>

can

The

I
sent
before
this
was
to
have
gone
a

an
accident
hindered
it

to

upon
