PROLOGUE--1599
-
-DOCTOR
LAMB
  
<EOS>
The
Sixteenth
Century
drew
to
a
close
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
last
day
of
the
last
year
,
and
two
hours
only
were
wanting
to
the
birth
of
another
year
and
of
another
century
.
 
<EOS>
The
night
was
solemn
and
beautiful
.
<EOS>
Myriads
of
stars
paved
the
deep
vault
of
heaven
;
the
crescent
moon
hung
like
a
silver
lamp
in
the
midst
of
them
;
a
stream
of
rosy
and
quivering
light
issuing
from
the
north
traversed
the
sky
,
like
the
tail
of
some
stupendous
comet
;
while
from
its
point
of
effluence
broke
forth
,
ever
and
anon
,
coruscations
rivalling
in
splendour
and
variety
of
hue
the
most
brilliant
discharge
of
fireworks
.
 
<EOS>
A
sharp
frost
prevailed
;
but
the
atmosphere
was
clear
and
dry
,
and
neither
wind
nor
snow
aggravated
the
wholesome
rigour
of
the
season
.
<EOS>
The
water
lay
in
thick
congealed
masses
around
the
conduits
and
wells
,
and
the
buckets
were
frozen
on
their
stands
.
<EOS>
The
thoroughfares
were
sheeted
with
ice
,
and
dangerous
to
horsemen
and
vehicles
;
but
the
footways
were
firm
and
pleasant
to
the
tread
.
 
<EOS>
Here
and
there
,
a
fire
was
lighted
in
the
streets
,
round
which
ragged
urchins
and
mendicants
were
collected
,
roasting
fragments
of
meat
stuck
upon
iron
prongs
;
or
quaffing
deep
draughts
of
metheglin
and
ale
,
out
of
leathern
cups
.
<EOS>
Crowds
were
collected
in
the
open
places
,
watching
the
wonders
in
the
heavens
,
and
drawing
auguries
from
them
,
chiefly
sinister
,
for
most
of
the
beholders
<EOS>
thought
the
signs
portended
the
speedy
death
of
the
queen
,
and
the
advent
of
a
new
monarch
from
the
north
a
safe
and
easy
interpretation
,
considering
the
advanced
age
and
declining
health
of
the
illustrious
Elizabeth
,
together
with
the
known
appointment
of
her
successor
,
James
of
Scotland
.
 
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
the
early
habits
of
the
times
,
few
persons
had
retired
to
rest
,
a
universal
wish
prevailing
among
the
citizens
to
see
the
new
year
in
,
and
welcome
the
century
accompanying
it
.
<EOS>
Lights
glimmered
in
most
windows
,
revealing
the
holly
-
sprigs
and
laurel
leaves
stuck
thickly
in
their
diamond
panes
;
while
,
whenever
a
door
was
opened
,
a
ruddy
gleam
burst
across
the
street
;
and
a
glance
inside
the
dwelling
showed
its
inmates
either
gathered
round
the
glowing
hearth
,
occupied
in
mirthful
sports
--
<EOS>
fox
-
i'-th'-hole
,
blind
-
man's
-
buff
,
or
shoe
-
the-
mare
--
or
seated
at
the
ample
board
groaning
with
Christmas
cheer
.
 
<EOS>
Music
and
singing
were
heard
at
every
comer
,
and
bands
of
comely
damsels
,
escorted
by
their
sweethearts
,
went
from
house
to
house
,
bearing
huge
brown
bowls
dressed
with
ribands
and
rosemary
,
and
filled
with
a
drink
called
"
lamb's
-
wool
"
,
composed
of
sturdy
ale
,
sweetened
with
sugar
,
spiced
with
nutmeg
,
and
having
toasts
and
burnt
crabs
floating
within
it,--a
draught
from
which
seldom
brought
its
pretty
bearers
less
than
a
groat
,
and
occasionally
a
more
valuable
coin
.
<EOS>
Such
was
the
vigil
of
the
year
1600
.
 
<EOS>
On
this
night
,
and
at
the
tenth
hour
,
a
man
of
striking
and
venerable
appearance
was
seen
to
emerge
upon
a
small
wooden
balcony
,
projecting
from
a
bay
-
window
near
the
top
of
a
picturesque
structure
situated
at
the
southern
extremity
of
London
-
bridge
.
 
<EOS>
The
old
man
's
beard
and
hair
were
as
white
as
snow
--
<EOS>
the
former
descending
almost
to
his
girdle
<EOS>
;
so
were
the
thick
over
--
hanging
brows
that
shaded
his
still
piercing
eyes
.
<EOS>
His
forehead
,
was
high
,
bald
,
and
ploughed
by
innumerable
wrinkles
.
<EOS>
His
countenance
,
despite
its
death-
like
paleness
,
had
a
noble
and
majestic
cast
,
and
his
figure
,
though
worn
to
the
bone
by
a
life
of
the
severest
study
,
and
bent
by
the
weight
of
years
,
must
have
been
once
lofty
and
commanding
.
<EOS>
His
dress
consisted
of
a
doublet
and
hose
of
sad
-
coloured
cloth
,
over
which
he
wore
a
loose
gown
of
black
silk
.
<EOS>
His
head
was
covered
by
a
square
black
cap
,
from
beneath
which
his
silver
locks
strayed
over
his
shoulders
.
 
<EOS>
Known
by
the
name
of
Doctor
Lamb
,
and
addicted
to
alchemical
and
philosophical
pursuits
,
this
venerable
personage
was
esteemed
by
the
vulgar
as
little
better
than
a
wizard
.
<EOS>
Strange
tales
were
reported
and
believed
of
him
.
<EOS>
Amongst
others
,
it
was
said
that
he
possessed
a
familiar
,
because
he
chanced
to
employ
a
deformed
,
crack
-
brained
dwarf
,
who
assisted
him
in
his
operations
,
and
whom
he
appropriately
enough
denominated
Flapdragon
.
 
<EOS>
Doctor
Lamb
's
gaze
was
fixed
intently
upon
the
heavens
,
and
he
seemed
to
be
noting
the
position
of
the
moon
with
reference
to
some
particular
star
.
 
<EOS>
After
remaining
in
this
posture
for
a
few
minutes
,
he
was
about
to
retire
,
when
a
loud
crash
arrested
him
,
and
he
turned
to
see
whence
it
proceeded
.
 
<EOS>
Immediately
before
him
stood
the
Southwark
Gateway
--
a
square
stone
building
,
with
a
round
,
embattled
turret
at
each
corner
,
and
a
flat
,
leaden
roof
,
planted
with
a
forest
of
poles
,
fifteen
or
sixteen
feet
high
,
garnished
with
human
heads
.
<EOS>
To
his
surprise
,
the
doctor
perceived
that
two
of
these
poles
had
just
been
overthrown
by
a
tall
man
,
who
was
in
the
act
of
stripping
them
of
their
grisly
burdens
.
 
<EOS>
Having
accomplished
his
object
,
the
mysterious
plunderer
thrust
his
spoil
into
a
leathern
bag
with
which
he
was
provided
,
tied
its
mouth
,
and
was
about
to
take
his
departure
by
means
of
a
rope
-
ladder
attached
to
the
battlements
,
when
his
retreat
was
suddenly
cut
off
by
the
gatekeeper
,
armed
with
a
halberd
,
and
bearing
a
lantern
,
who
issued
from
a
door
opening
upon
the
leads
.
 
<EOS>
The
baffled
marauder
looked
round
,
and
remarking
the
open
window
at
which
Doctor
Lamb
was
stationed
,
hurled
the
sack
and
its
contents
through
it
.
<EOS>
He
then
tried
to
gain
the
ladder
,
but
was
intercepted
by
the
gatekeeper
,
who
dealt
him
a
severe
blow
on
the
head
with
his
halberd
.
<EOS>
The
plunderer
uttered
a
loud
cry
,
and
attempted
to
draw
his
sword
;
but
before
he
could
do
so
,
he
received
a
thrust
in
the
side
from
his
opponent
.
<EOS>
He
then
fell
,
and
the
gatekeeper
would
have
repeated
the
blow
,
if
the
doctor
had
not
called
to
him
to
desist
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
not
kill
him
,
good
Baldred
,
"
he
cried
.
<EOS>
"
The
attempt
may
not
be
so
criminal
as
it
appears
.
<EOS>
Doubtless
,
the
mutilated
remains
which
the
poor
wretch
has
attempted
to
carry
off
,
are
those
of
his
kindred
,
and
horror
at
their
exposure
must
have
led
him
to
commit
the
offence
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
may
be
,
doctor
,
"
replied
Baldred
;
"
and
if
so
I
shall
be
sorry
I
have
hurt
him
.
<EOS>
But
I
am
responsible
for
the
safe
custody
of
these
traitorous
relics
,
and
it
is
as
much
as
my
own
head
is
worth
to
permit
their
removal
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
it
,
"
replied
Doctor
Lamb
;
"
and
you
are
fully
justified
in
what
you
have
done
.
<EOS>
It
may
throw
some
light
upon
the
matter
,
to
know
whose
miserable
remains
have
been
disturbed
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
They
were
the
heads
of
two
rank
,
papists
,
"
replied
Baldred
,
"
who
were
decapitated
on
Tower
Hill
,
on
Saint
Nicholas
's
day
,
three
weeks
ago
,
for
conspiring
against
the
queen
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
their
names
?
"
demanded
the
doctor
.
<EOS>
"
How
were
they
called
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
They
were
father
and
son
,
"
replied
Baldred;--"Sir
Simon
Darcy
and
Master
Reginald
Darcy
.
<EOS>
Perchance
they
were
known
to
your
worship
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Too
well
--
too
well
!
"
replied
Doctor
Lamb
,
in
a
voice
of
emotion
,
that
startled
his
hearer
.
<EOS>
"
They
were
near
kinsmen
mine
own
.
<EOS>
What
is
he
like
who
has
made
this
strange
attempt
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Of
a
verity
,
a
fair
youth
,
"
replied
Baldred
,
holding
down
the
lantern
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Heaven
grant
<EOS>
I
have
not
wounded
him
to
the
death
!
<EOS>
No
,
his
heart
still
beats
.
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
here
are
his
tablets
,
"
he
added
,
taking
a
small
book
from
his
doublet
;
"
these
may
give
the
information
you
seek
.
<EOS>
You
were
right
in
your
conjecture
,
doctor
.
<EOS>
The
name
herein
inscribed
is
the
same
as
that
borne
by
the
others
--
Auriol
Darcy
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
see
it
all
,
"
cried
Lamb
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
a
pious
and
praiseworthy
deed
.
<EOS>
Bring
the
unfortunate
youth
to
my
dwelling
,
Baldred
,
and
you
shall
be
well
rewarded
.
<EOS>
Use
despatch
,
I
pray
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
As
the
gatekeeper
essayed
to
comply
,
the
wounded
man
groaned
deeply
,
as
if
in
great
pain
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ring
me
the
weapon
with
which
you
smote
him
,
"
cried
Doctor
Lamb
,
in
accents
of
commiseration
,
"
and
I
will
anoint
it
with
the
powder
of
sympathy
.
<EOS>
His
anguish
will
be
speedily
abated
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
your
worship
can
accomplish
wonders
,
"
cried
Baldred
,
throwing
the
halberd
into
the
balcony
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
do
my
part
as
gently
as
I
can
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
as
the
alchemist
took
up
the
weapon
,
and
disappeared
through
the
window
,
the
gatekeeper
lifted
the
wounded
man
by
the
shoulders
,
and
conveyed
him
down
a
narrow
winding
staircase
to
a
lower
chamber
.
<EOS>
Though
he
proceeded
carefully
,
the
sufferer
was
put
to
excruciating
pain
;
and
when
Baldred
placed
him
on
a
wooden
bench
,
and
held
a
lamp
towards
him
,
he
perceived
that
his
features
were
darkened
and
distorted
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
fear
it
's
all
over
with
him
,
"
murmured
the
gatekeeper
;
"
I
shall
have
a
dead
body
to
take
to
Doctor
Lamb
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
a
charity
to
knock
him
on
the
head
,
rather
than
let
him
suffer
thus
.
<EOS>
The
doctor
passes
for
a
cunning
man
,
but
if
he
can
cure
this
poor
youth
without
seeing
him
,
by
the
help
of
his
sympathetic
ointment
,
I
shall
begin
to
believe
,
what
some
folks
avouch
,
that
he
has
relations
with
the
devil
.
"
 
<EOS>
While
Baldred
was
ruminating
in
this
manner
,
a
sudden
and
extraordinary
change
took
place
in
the
sufferer
.
<EOS>
As
if
by
magic
,
the
contraction
of
the
muscles
subsided
;
the
features
assumed
a
wholesome
hue
,
and
the
respiration
was
no
longer
laborious
.
<EOS>
Baldred
stared
as
if
a
miracle
had
been
wrought
.
 
<EOS>
Now
that
the
countenance
of
the
youth
had
regained
its
original
expression
,
the
gatekeeper
could
not
help
being
struck
by
its
extreme
beauty
.
<EOS>
The
face
was
a
perfect
oval
,
with
regular
and
delicate
features
.
<EOS>
A
short
silken
moustache
covered
the
upper
lip
,
which
was
short
and
proud
,
and
a
pointed
beard
terminated
the
chin
.
<EOS>
The
hair
was
black
,
glossy
,
and
cut
short
,
so
as
to
disclose
a
highly
intellectual
expanse
of
brow
.
 
<EOS>
The
youth
's
figure
was
slight
,
but
admirably
proportioned
His
attire
consisted
of
a
black
satin
doublet
,
slashed
with
white
,
hose
of
black
silk
,
and
a
short
velvet
mantle
.
<EOS>
His
eyes
were
still
closed
,
and
it
was
difficult
to
say
what
effect
they
might
give
to
the
face
when
they
lighted
it
up
;
but
notwithstanding
its
beauty
,
it
was
impossible
not
to
admit
that
a
strange
,
sinister
,
and
almost
demoniacal
expression
pervaded
the
countenance
.
 
<EOS>
All
at
once
,
and
with
as
much
suddenness
as
his
cure
had
been
effected
,
the
young
man
started
,
uttering
a
piercing
cry
,
and
placed
his
hand
to
his
side
.
 
<EOS>
"
Caitiff
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
,
fixing
his
blazing
eyes
on
the
gatekeeper
,
"
why
do
you
torture
me
thus
?
<EOS>
Finish
me
at
once
--
Oh
!
"
 
<EOS>
And
overcome
by
anguish
,
he
sank
back
again
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
touched
you
,
sir
,
"
replied
Baldred
.
<EOS>
"
I
brought
you
here
to
succour
you
.
<EOS>
You
will
be
easier
anon
.
<EOS>
Doctor
Lamb
must
have
wiped
the
halberd
,
"
he
added
to
himself
.
 
<EOS>
Another
sudden
change
.
<EOS>
The
pain
fled
from
the
sufferer
's
countenance
,
and
he
became
easy
as
before
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
have
you
done
to
me
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
,
with
a
look
of
gratitude
;
"
the
torture
of
my
wound
has
suddenly
ceased
,
and
I
feel
as
if
a
balm
had
been
dropped
into
it
,
Let
me
remain
in
this
state
if
you
have
any
pity
--
or
despatch
me
,
for
my
late
agony
was
almost
insupportable
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
cared
for
by
one
who
has
greater
skill
than
any
surgeon
in
London
,
"
replied
Baldred
.
<EOS>
"
If
I
can
manage
to
transport
you
to
his
lodgings
,
he
will
speedily
heal
your
wounds
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Do
not
delay
,
then
,
"
replied
Auriol
,
faintly
;
"
for
though
I
am
free
from
pain
,
I
feel
that
my
life
is
ebbing
fast
away
.
 
<EOS>
"
Press
this
handkerchief
to
your
side
,
and
lean
on
me
.
"
said
Baldred
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Doctor
Lamb
's
dwelling
is
but
a
step
from
the
gateway
--
in
fact
,
the
first
house
on
the
bridge
.
<EOS>
By
the
way
,
the
doctor
declares
he
is
your
kinsman
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
the
first
I
ever
heard
of
him
,
"
replied
Auriol
,
faintly
;
"
but
take
me
to
him
quickly
,
or
it
will
be
too
late
.
"
 
<EOS>
In
another
moment
they
were
at
the
doctor
's
door
.
<EOS>
Baldred
tapped
against
it
,
and
the
summons
was
instantly
answered
by
a
diminutive
personage
,
clad
in
a
jerkin
of
coarse
grey
serge
,
and
having
a
leathern
apron
tied
round
his
waist
.
<EOS>
This
was
Flapdragon
.
 
<EOS>
Blear
-
eyed
,
smoke
-
begrimed
,
lantern
-
jawed
,
the
poor
dwarf
seemed
as
if
his
whole
life
had
been
spent
over
the
furnace
.
<EOS>
And
so
,
in
fact
,
it
had
been
.
<EOS>
He
had
become
little
better
than
a
pair
of
human
bellows
.
<EOS>
In
his
hand
he
held
the
halberd
with
which
Auriol
had
been
wounded
.
 
<EOS>
"
So
you
have
been
playing
the
leech
.
<EOS>
,
Flapdragon
,
eh
?
"
cried
Baldred
.
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
marry
have
I
,
"
replied
the
dwarf
,
with
a
wild
grin
,
and
displaying
a
wolfish
set
of
teeth
,
"
<EOS>
My
master
ordered
me
to
smear
the
halberd
with
the
sympathetic
ointment
.
<EOS>
I
obeyed
him
;
rubbed
the
steel
point
,
first
on
one
side
,
then
on
the
other
;
next
wiped
it
;
and
then
smeared
it
again
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Whereby
you
put
the
patient
to
exquisite
pain
,
"
replied
Baldred
;
"
but
help
me
to
transport
him
to
the
laboratory
'
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
not
if
the
doctor
will
care
to
be
disturbed
,
"
said
Flapdragon
.
<EOS>
"
He
is
busily
engaged
on
a
grand
operation
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
take
the
risk
on
myself
,
"
said
Baldred
.
<EOS>
"
The
youth
will
die
if
he
remains
here
.
<EOS>
See
,
he
has
fainted
already
!
"
 
<EOS>
Thus
urged
,
the
dwarf
laid
down
the
halberd
,
and
between
the
two
,
Auriol
was
speedily
conveyed
up
a
wide
oaken
staircase
to
the
laboratory
.
<EOS>
Doctor
Lamb
was
plying
the
bellows
at
the
furnace
,
on
which
a
large
alembic
was
placed
,
and
he
was
so
engrossed
by
his
task
,
that
he
scarcely
noticed
the
entrance
of
the
others
.
 
<EOS>
"
Place
the
youth
on
the
ground
,
and
rear
his
head
against
the
chair
,
"
he
cried
,
hastily
,
to
the
dwarf
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Bathe
his
brows
with
the
decoction
in
that
crucible
.
<EOS>
I
will
attend
to
him
anon
.
<EOS>
Come
to
me
on
the
morrow
,
Baldred
,
and
I
will
repay
thee
for
thy
trouble
.
<EOS>
I
am
busy
now
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
These
relics
,
doctor
,
"
cried
the
gatekeeper
,
glancing
at
the
bag
,
which
was
lying
on
the
ground
,
and
from
which
a
bald
head
extruded--"I
ought
to
take
them
back
with
me
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Heed
them
not
--
they
will
be
safe
in
my
keeping
,
"
cried
Doctor
Lamb
,
impatiently
;
"
tomorrow
--
tomorrow
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Casting
a
furtive
glance
round
the
laboratory
,
and
shrugging
his
shoulders
,
Baldred
departed
;
and
Flapdragon
having
bathed
the
sufferer
's
temples
with
the
decoction
,
in
obedience
to
his
master
's
injunctions
,
turned
to
inquire
what
he
should
do
next
.
 
<EOS>
"
Be
gone
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
doctor
,
so
fiercely
that
the
dwarf
darted
out
of
the
room
,
clapping
the
door
after
him
.
 
<EOS>
Doctor
Lamb
then
applied
himself
to
his
task
with
renewed
ardour
,
and
in
a
few
seconds
became
wholly
insensible
of
the
presence
of
a
stranger
.
 
<EOS>
Revived
by
the
stimulant
,
Auriol
presently
opened
his
eyes
,
and
gazing
round
the
room
,
thought
he
must
be
dreaming
,
so
strange
and
fantastical
did
all
appear
.
<EOS>
The
floor
was
covered
with
the
implements
used
by
the
adept
--
bolt
-
heads
,
crucibles
,
cucurbites
,
and
retorts
,
scattered
about
without
any
attempt
at
arrangement
.
<EOS>
In
one
corner
was
a
large
terrestrial
sphere
;
near
it
was
an
astrolabe
;
and
near
that
a
heap
of
disused
glass
vessels
.
<EOS>
On
the
other
side
,
lay
a
black
,
mysterious
-
looking
book
,
fastened
with
brazen
clasps
.
<EOS>
Around
it
,
were
a
ram
's
horn
,
a
pair
of
forceps
,
a
roll
of
parchment
,
a
pestle
and
mortar
,
and
a
large
plate
of
copper
,
graven
with
the
mysterious
symbols
of
the
Isaical
table
.
<EOS>
Near
this
was
the
leathern
bag
containing
the
two
decapitated
heads
,
one
of
which
had
burst
forth
.
<EOS>
On
a
table
,
at
the
further
end
of
the
room
,
stood
a
large
open
volume
,
with
parchment
leaves
,
covered
with
cabbalistical
characters
,
referring
to
the
names
of
spirits
.
<EOS>
Near
it
were
two
parchment
scrolls
,
written
in
letters
,
respectively
denominated
by
the
Chaldaic
sages
,
"
the
Malachim
"
,
and
"
the
Passing
of
the
River
"
.
<EOS>
One
of
these
scrolls
was
kept
in
its
place
by
a
skull
.
<EOS>
An
ancient
and
grotesque
-
looking
brass
lamp
,
with
two
snake
-
headed
burners
,
lighted
the
room
.
<EOS>
From
the
ceiling
depended
a
huge
scaly
sea
-
monster
,
with
outspread
fins
,
open
jaws
,
garnished
with
tremendous
teeth
,
and
great
goggling
eyes
,
<EOS>
Near
it
hung
a
celestial
sphere
.
<EOS>
The
chimney
-
piece
,
which
was
curiously
carved
,
and
projected
far
into
the
room
,
was
laden
with
various
implements
of
Hermetic
science
.
<EOS>
Above
it
were
hung
dried
bats
and
flitter
-
mice
,
interspersed
with
the
skulls
of
birds
and
apes
.
<EOS>
Attached
to
the
chimney
-
piece
was
a
horary
,
sculptured
in
stone
,
near
which
hung
a
large
star
-
fish
.
<EOS>
The
fireplace
was
occupied
by
the
furnace
,
in
which
,
as
has
been
stated
,
was
placed
an
alembic
,
communicating
by
means
of
a
long
serpentine
pipe
with
a
receiver
.
<EOS>
Within
the
room
were
two
skeletons
,
one
of
which
,
placed
behind
a
curtain
in
the
deep
embrasure
of
the
window
,
where
its
polished
bones
glistened
in
the
white
moonlight
,
had
a
horrible
effect
.
<EOS>
The
other
enjoyed
more
comfortable
quarters
near
the
chimney
,
its
fleshless
feet
dangling
down
in
the
smoke
arising
from
the
furnace
.
 
<EOS>
Doctor
Lamb
,
meanwhile
,
steadily
pursued
his
task
,
though
he
ever
and
anon
paused
,
to
fling
certain
roots
and
drugs
upon
the
charcoal
.
<EOS>
As
he
did
this
,
various
-
coloured
flames
broke
forth
--
now
blue
,
now
green
,
now
blood
-
red
.
 
<EOS>
Tinged
by
these
fires
,
the
different
objects
in
the
chamber
seemed
to
take
other
forms
,
and
to
become
instinct
with
animation
.
<EOS>
The
gourd-
shaped
cucurbites
were
transformed
into
great
bloated
toads
bursting
with
venom
;
the
long
-
necked
bolt
-
heads
became
monstrous
serpents
;
the
worm
-
like
pipes
turned
into
adders
;
the
alembics
looked
like
plumed
helmets
;
the
characters
on
the
Isaical
table
,
and
those
on
the
parchments
,
seemed
traced
in
fire
,
and
to
be
ever
changing
;
the
sea-
monster
bellowed
and
roared
,
and
,
flapping
his
fins
,
tried
to
burst
from
his
hook
;
the
skeletons
wagged
their
jaws
,
and
raised
their
fleshless
fingers
in
mockery
,
while
blue
lights
burnt
in
their
eyeless
sockets
;
the
bellows
became
a
prodigious
bat
fanning
the
fire
with
its
wings
:
and
the
old
Alchemist
assumed
the
appearance
of
the
arch
-
fiend
presiding
over
a
witches
'
sabbath
.
 
<EOS>
Auriol
's
brain
reeled
,
and
he
pressed
his
hand
to
his
eyes
,
to
exclude
these
phantasms
from
his
sight
.
<EOS>
But
even
thus
they
pursued
him
;
and
he
imagined
he
could
hear
the
infernal
riot
going
on
around
him
.
 
<EOS>
Suddenly
,
he
was
roused
by
a
loud
joyful
cry
,
and
,
uncovering
his
eyes
,
he
beheld
Doctor
Lamb
pouring
the
contents
of
the
matrass
--
a
bright
,
transparent
liquid
--
into
a
small
phial
.
<EOS>
Having
carefully
secured
the
bottle
with
a
glass
stopper
,
the
old
man
held
it
towards
the
light
,
and
gazed
at
it
with
rapture
.
<EOS>
"
At
length
,
"
he
exclaimed
aloud--"at
length
,
the
great
work
is
achieved
.
<EOS>
With
the
birth
of
the
century
now
expiring
I
first
saw
light
,
and
the
draught
I
hold
in
my
hand
shall
enable
me
to
see
the
opening
of
centuries
and
centuries
to
come
.
<EOS>
Composed
of
the
lunar
stones
,
the
solar
stones
,
and
the
mercurial
stones
--
prepared
according
to
the
instructions
of
the
Rabbi
Ben
Lucca
,
namely
,
by
the
separation
of
the
pure
from
the
impure
,
the
volatilisation
of
the
fixed
,
and
the
fixing
of
the
volatile
;
this
elixir
shall
renew
my
youth
,
like
that
of
the
eagle
,
and
give
me
length
of
days
greater
than
any
patriarch
ever
enjoyed
.
"
 
<EOS>
While
thus
speaking
,
he
held
up
the
sparkling
liquid
,
and
gazed
at
it
like
a
Persian
worshipping
the
sun
.
 
<EOS>
"
To
live
for
ever
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
,
after
a
pause--"to
escape
the
jaws
of
death
just
when
they
are
opening
to
devour
me!--to
<EOS>
be
free
from
all
accidents!--'tis
a
glorious
thought
!
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
I
bethink
me
,
the
rabbi
said
there
was
one
peril
against
which
the
elixir
could
not
guard
me
--
one
vulnerable
point
;
by
which
,
like
the
heel
of
Achilles
,
death
might
reach
me
!
<EOS>
What
is
it?--where
can
it
lie
?
"
 
<EOS>
And
he
relapsed
into
deep
thought
.
 
<EOS>
"
This
uncertainty
will
poison
all
my
happiness
,
"
he
continued
;
"
I
shall
live
in
constant
dread
,
as
of
an
invisible
enemy
.
<EOS>
But
no
matter
!
<EOS>
Perpetual
life!--perpetual
youth!--what
more
need
be
desired
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
more
,
indeed
!
"
cried
Auriol
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ha
!
"
exclaimed
the
doctor
,
suddenly
recollecting
the
wounded
man
,
and
concealing
the
phial
beneath
his
gown
.
 
<EOS>
"
Your
caution
is
vain
,
doctor
,
"
said
Auriol
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
heard
what
you
have
uttered
.
<EOS>
You
fancy
you
have
discovered
the
elixir
vitae
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Fancy
,
I
have
discovered
it
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Doctor
Lamb
.
<EOS>
"
The
matter
is
past
all
doubt
.
<EOS>
I
am
the
possessor
of
the
wondrous
secret
,
which
the
greatest
philosophers
of
all
ages
have
sought
to
discover
--
the
miraculous
preservative
of
the
body
against
decay
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
man
who
brought
me
hither
told
me
you
were
my
kinsman
,
"
said
Auriol
.
<EOS>
"
Is
it
so
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
,
"
replied
the
doctor
,
"
and
you
shall
now
learn
the
connect
ion
that
subsists
between
us
.
<EOS>
Look
at
that
ghastly
relic
,
"
he
added
,
pointing
to
the
head
protruding
from
the
bag
,
"
that
was
once
my
son
Simon
.
<EOS>
His
son
's
head
is
within
the
sack
--
your
father
's
head
--
so
that
four
generations
are
brought
together
.
"
<EOS>
"
Gracious
Heaven
!
"
exclaimed
the
young
man
,
raising
himself
on
his
elbow
.
<EOS>
"
You
,
then
,
are
my
great
-
grandsire
.
<EOS>
My
father
supposed
you
had
died
in
his
infancy
.
<EOS>
An
old
tale
runs
in
the
family
that
you
were
charged
with
sorcery
,
and
fled
to
avoid
the
stake
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
true
that
I
fled
,
and
took
the
name
I
bear
at
present
,
"
replied
the
old
man
,
"
but
<EOS>
I
need
scarcely
say
that
the
charge
brought
against
me
was
false
.
<EOS>
I
have
devoted
myself
to
abstrusest
science
;
have
held
commune
with
the
stars
;
and
have
wrested
the
most
hidden
secrets
from
Nature
--
but
that
is
all
.
<EOS>
Two
crimes
alone
have
stained
my
soul
,
but
both
,
I
trust
,
have
been
expiated
by
repentance
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Were
they
deeds
of
blood
?
"
asked
Auriol
.
 
<EOS>
"
One
was
so
,
"
replied
Darcy
,
with
a
shudder
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
a
cowardly
and
treacherous
deed
,
aggravated
by
the
basest
ingratitude
.
<EOS>
Listen
,
and
you
shall
hear
how
it
chanced
.
<EOS>
A
Roman
rabbi
,
named
Ben
Lucca
,
skilled
in
Hermetic
science
,
came
to
this
city
.
<EOS>
His
fame
reached
me
,
and
I
sought
him
out
,
offering
myself
as
his
disciple
.
<EOS>
For
months
,
I
remained
with
him
in
his
laboratory
working
at
the
furnace
,
and
poring
over
mystic
lore
.
<EOS>
One
night
,
he
showed
me
that
volume
,
and
,
pointing
to
a
page
within
it
,
said
:
'
Those
characters
contain
the
secret
of
confecting
the
elixir
of
life
.
<EOS>
I
now
explain
them
to
you
;
and
afterwards
we
will
proceed
to
the
operation
.
'
<EOS>
With
this
,
he
unfolded
the
mystery
;
but
he
bade
me
observe
,
that
the
menstruum
was
defective
on
one
point
.
<EOS>
Wherefore
,
he
said
,
'
there
will
still
be
peril
from
some
hidden
cause
.
'
<EOS>
Oh
,
with
what
greediness
I
drank
in
his
words
!
<EOS>
How
I
gazed
at
the
mystic
characters
,
as
he
explained
their
import
!
<EOS>
What
visions
floated
before
me
of
perpetual
youth
and
enjoyment
.
<EOS>
At
that
moment
a
demon
whispered
in
my
ear,--"This
secret
must
be
thine
own
.
<EOS>
No
one
else
must
possess
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ha
!
"
exclaimed
Auriol
,
starting
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
evil
thought
was
no
sooner
conceived
than
acted
upon
,
"
pursued
Darcy
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Instantly
drawing
my
poniard
,
I
plunged
it
to
the
rabbi
's
heart
.
<EOS>
But
mark
what
followed
.
<EOS>
His
blood
fell
upon
the
book
,
and
obliterated
the
characters
;
nor
could
I
by
any
effort
of
memory
recall
the
composition
of
the
elixir
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
When
did
you
regain
the
secret
?
"
asked
Auriol
,
curiously
.
 
<EOS>
"
Tonight
,
"
replied
Darcy--"within
this
hour
.
<EOS>
For
nigh
fifty
years
after
that
fatal
night
I
have
been
making
fruitless
experiments
.
<EOS>
A
film
of
blood
has
obscured
my
mental
sight
.
<EOS>
I
have
proceeded
by
calcitration
,
solution
,
putrefaction
--
have
produced
the
oils
which
will
fix
crude
mercury
,
and
convert
all
bodies
into
sol
and
luna
;
but
I
have
ever
failed
in
fermenting
the
stone
into
the
true
elixir
.
<EOS>
Tonight
,
it
came
into
my
head
to
wash
the
blood
-
stained
page
containing
the
secret
with
a
subtle
liquid
.
<EOS>
I
did
so
;
and
doubting
the
efficacy
of
the
experiment
,
left
it
to
work
,
while
I
went
forth
to
breath
the
air
at
my
window
.
<EOS>
My
eyes
were
cast
upwards
,
and
I
was
struck
with
the
malignant
aspect
of
my
star
.
<EOS>
How
to
reconcile
this
with
the
good
fortune
which
has
just
befallen
me
,
I
know
not
--
<EOS>
but
so
it
was
.
<EOS>
At
this
juncture
,
your
rash
,
but
pious
attempt
occurred
.
<EOS>
Having
discovered
our
relationship
,
and
enjoined
the
gatekeeper
to
bring
you
hither
,
I
returned
to
my
old
laboratory
.
<EOS>
On
glancing
towards
the
mystic
volume
,
what
was
my
surprise
to
see
the
page
free
from
blood
!
"
 
<EOS>
Auriol
uttered
a
slight
exclamation
,
and
gazed
at
the
book
with
superstitious
awe
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
sight
was
so
surprising
,
that
I
dropped
the
sack
I
had
brought
with
me
,
"
pursued
Darcy
.
"
<EOS>
Fearful
of
again
losing
the
secret
,
I
nerved
myself
to
the
task
,
and
placing
fuel
on
the
fire
,
dismissed
my
attendant
with
brief
injunctions
relative
to
you
.
<EOS>
I
then
set
to
work
.
<EOS>
How
I
have
succeeded
,
you
perceive
.
<EOS>
I
hold
in
my
hand
the
treasure
I
have
so
long
sought
--
so
eagerly
coveted
.
<EOS>
The
whole
world
's
wealth
should
not
purchase
it
from
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
Auriol
gazed
earnestly
at
his
aged
relative
,
but
he
said
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
"
In
a
few
moments
I
shall
be
as
full
of
vigour
and
activity
as
yourself
,
"
continued
Darcy
.
<EOS>
"
We
shall
be
no
longer
the
great
-
grandsire
and
his
descendant
,
but
friends
--
companions
--
equals,--equals
in
age
,
strength
,
activity
,
beauty
,
fortune
--
for
youth
is
fortune
ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
Methinks
I
am
already
young
again
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
spoke
of
two
crimes
with
which
your
conscience
was
burdened
,
"
remarked
Auriol
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
mentioned
but
one
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
other
was
not
so
foul
as
that
I
have
described
,
"
replied
Darcy
,
in
an
altered
tone
,
"
in
as
much
as
it
was
unintentional
,
and
occasioned
by
no
base
motive
.
<EOS>
My
wife
,
your
ancestress
,
was
a
most
lovely
woman
,
and
so
passionately
was
I
enamoured
of
her
,
that
I
tried
by
every
art
to
heighten
and
preserve
her
beauty
.
<EOS>
I
fed
her
upon
the
flesh
of
capons
,
nourished
with
vipers
;
caused
her
to
steep
her
lovely
limbs
in
baths
distilled
from
roses
and
violets
;
and
had
recourse
to
the
most
potent
cosmetics
.
<EOS>
At
last
I
prepared
a
draught
from
poisons--
<EOS>
yes
,
poisons
--
the
effect
of
which
I
imagined
would
be
wondrous
.
<EOS>
She
drank
it
,
and
expired
horribly
disfigured
.
<EOS>
Conceive
my
despair
at
beholding
the
fair
image
of
my
idolatry
destroyed
--
defaced
by
my
hand
.
<EOS>
In
my
frenzy
I
should
have
laid
violent
hands
upon
myself
,
if
I
had
not
been
restrained
.
<EOS>
Love
may
again
rule
my
heart
--
beauty
may
again
dazzle
my
eyes
,
but
I
shall
never
more
feel
the
passion
I
entertained
for
my
lost
Amice
--
never
more
behold
charms
equal
to
hers
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
he
pressed
his
hand
to
his
face
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
mistake
you
then
committed
should
serve
as
a
warning
,
"
replied
Auriol
.
<EOS>
"
What
if
it
be
poison
you
have
now
confected
?
<EOS>
Try
a
few
drops
of
it
on
some
animal
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
--
no
;
it
is
the
true
elixir
,
"
replied
Darcy
.
<EOS>
"
Not
a
drop
must
be
wasted
.
<EOS>
You
will
witness
its
effect
anon
.
<EOS>
Like
the
snake
,
I
shall
cast
my
slough
,
and
come
forth
younger
than
I
was
at
twenty
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Meantime
,
I
beseech
you
to
render
me
some
assistance
,
"
groaned
Auriol
,
"
or
,
while
you
are
preparing
for
immortality
,
I
shall
expire
before
your
eyes
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Be
not
afraid
,
"
replied
Darcy
;
"
you
shall
take
no
harm
.
<EOS>
I
will
care
for
you
presently
;
and
I
understand
leechcraft
so
well
,
that
I
will
answer
for
your
speedy
and
perfect
recovery
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Drink
,
then
,
to
it
!
"
cried
Auriol
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
not
what
stays
my
hand
,
"
said
the
old
man
,
raising
the
phial
;
"
but
now
that
immortality
is
in
my
reach
,
I
dare
not
grasp
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Give
me
the
potion
,
then
,
"
cried
Auriol
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
for
worlds
,
"
rejoined
Darcy
,
hugging
the
phial
to
his
breast
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
;
I
will
be
young
again
--
rich
--
happy
.
<EOS>
I
will
go
forth
into
the
world
--
I
will
bask
in
the
smiles
of
beauty
--
<EOS>
I
will
feast
,
revel
,
sing
--
life
shall
be
one
perpetual
round
of
enjoyment
.
<EOS>
Now
for
the
trial
--
ha
!
"
<EOS>
and
,
as
he
raised
the
potion
towards
his
lips
,
a
sudden
pang
shot
across
his
heart
.
<EOS>
"
What
is
this
?
"
<EOS>
he
cried
,
staggering
.
"
<EOS>
Can
death
assail
me
when
I
am
just
about
to
enter
upon
perpetual
life
?
<EOS>
Help
me
,
good
grandson
!
<EOS>
Place
the
phial
to
my
lips
.
<EOS>
Pour
its
contents
down
my
throat
--
quick
!
<EOS>
quick
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
too
weak
to
stir
,
"
groaned
Auriol
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
delayed
it
too
long
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Heavens
!
<EOS>
we
shall
both
perish
,
"
shrieked
Darcy
,
vainly
endeavouring
to
raise
his
palsied
arm,--"perish
with
the
blissful
shore
in
view
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
he
sank
backwards
,
and
would
have
fallen
to
the
ground
if
he
had
not
caught
at
the
terrestrial
sphere
for
support
.
 
<EOS>
"
Help
me
--
help
me
!
"
<EOS>
he
screamed
,
fixing
a
glance
of
unutterable
anguish
on
his
relative
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
worth
the
struggle
,
"
cried
Auriol
.
<EOS>
And
,
by
a
great
effort
,
he
raised
himself
,
and
staggered
towards
the
old
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
Saved
--
saved
!
"
shrieked
Darcy
.
<EOS>
"
Pour
it
down
my
throat
.
<EOS>
An
instant
,
and
all
will
be
well
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Think
you
I
have
done
this
for
you
?
"
cried
Auriol
,
snatching
the
potion
;
"
no
--
no
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
,
supporting
himself
against
the
furnace
,
he
placed
the
phial
to
his
lips
,
and
eagerly
drained
its
contents
.
 
<EOS>
The
old
man
seemed
paralysed
by
the
action
,
but
kept
his
eye
fixed
upon
the
youth
till
he
had
drained
the
elixir
to
the
last
drop
.
<EOS>
He
then
uttered
a
piercing
cry
,
threw
up
his
arm
,
and
fell
heavily
backwards
.
 
<EOS>
Dead
--
dead
!
 
<EOS>
Flashes
of
light
passed
before
Auriol
's
eyes
,
and
strange
noises
smote
his
ears
.
<EOS>
For
a
moment
he
was
bewildered
as
with
wine
,
and
laughed
and
sang
discordantly
like
a
madman
.
<EOS>
Every
object
reeled
and
danced
around
him
.
<EOS>
The
glass
vessels
and
jars
clashed
their
brittle
sides
together
,
yet
remained
uninjured
;
the
furnace
breathed
forth
flames
and
mephitic
vapours
;
the
spiral
worm
of
the
alembic
became
red
hot
,
and
seemed
filled
with
molten
lead
;
the
pipe
of
the
bolt
-
head
ran
blood
;
the
sphere
of
the
earth
rolled
along
the
floor
,
and
rebounded
from
the
wail
as
if
impelled
by
a
giant
hand
;
the
skeletons
grinned
and
gibbered
;
so
did
the
death's
-
head
on
the
table
;
so
did
the
skulls
against
the
chimney
;
<EOS>
the
monstrous
sea
-
fish
belched
forth
fire
and
smoke
<EOS>
;
the
bald
decapitated
head
opened
its
eyes
,
and
fixed
them
,
with
a
stony
glare
,
on
the
young
man
;
while
the
dead
alchemist
shook
his
hand
menacingly
at
him
.
 
<EOS>
Unable
to
bear
these
accumulated
horrors
,
Auriol
became
,
for
a
short
space
,
insensible
.
<EOS>
On
recovering
,
all
was
still
.
<EOS>
The
lights
within
the
lamp
had
expired
;
but
the
bright
moonlight
,
streaming
through
the
window
,
fell
upon
the
rigid
features
of
the
unfortunate
alchemist
,
and
on
the
cabalistic
characters
of
the
open
volume
beside
him
.
<EOS>
Eager
to
test
the
effect
of
the
elixir
,
Auriol
put
his
hand
to
his
side
.
<EOS>
All
traces
of
the
wound
were
gone
;
nor
did
he
experience
the
slightest
pain
in
any
other
part
of
his
body
.
<EOS>
On
the
contrary
,
he
seemed
endowed
with
preternatural
strength
.
<EOS>
His
breast
dilated
with
rapture
,
and
he
longed
to
expand
his
joy
in
active
notion
.
<EOS>
Striding
over
the
body
of
his
aged
relative
,
he
threw
open
the
window
.
<EOS>
As
he
did
so
joyous
peals
burst
from
surrounding
churches
,
announcing
the
arrival
of
the
new
year
.
<EOS>
While
listening
to
this
clamour
,
Auriol
gazed
at
the
populous
and
picturesque
city
<EOS>
stretched
out
before
him
,
and
bathed
in
the
moonlight
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
hundred
years
hence
,
"
he
thought
,
"
and
scarcely
one
soul
of
the
thousands
within
those
houses
will
be
living
,
save
myself
.
<EOS>
A
hundred
years
after
that
,
and
their
children
's
children
will
be
gone
to
the
grave
.
<EOS>
But
I
shall
live
on
--
shall
live
through
all
changes
--
all
customs
--
all
time
.
<EOS>
What
revelations
I
shall
then
have
to
make
,
if
I
should
dare
to
disclose
them
!
"
 
<EOS>
As
he
ruminated
thus
,
the
skeleton
hanging
near
him
was
swayed
by
the
wind
,
and
its
bony
fingers
came
in
contact
with
his
cheek
.
<EOS>
A
dread
idea
was
suggested
by
the
occurrence
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
is
one
peril
to
be
avoided
<EOS>
,
"
he
thought
;
"
ONE
PERIL!--what
is
it
?
<EOS>
Pshaw
!
<EOS>
I
will
think
no
more
of
it
.
<EOS>
It
may
never
arise
.
<EOS>
I
will
be
gone
.
<EOS>
This
place
fevers
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
With
this
,
he
left
the
laboratory
,
and
hastily
descending
the
stairs
,
at
the
foot
of
which
he
found
Flapdragon
,
passed
out
of
the
house
.

<EOS>
THE
RUINED
HOUSE
IN
THE
VAUXHALL
ROAD
 
<EOS>
One
night
,
in
the
spring
of
1830
,
two
men
issued
from
a
low
,
obscurely
situated
public
-
house
,
near
Millbank
,
and
shaped
their
course
apparently
in
the
direction
of
Vauxhall
-
bridge
.
<EOS>
Avoiding
the
footpath
near
the
river
,
they
moved
stealthily
along
the
further
side
of
the
road
,
where
the
open
ground
offered
them
an
easy
means
of
flight
,
in
case
such
a
course
should
he
found
expedient
.
<EOS>
So
far
as
it
could
be
discerned
by
the
glimpses
of
the
moon
,
which
occasionally
shone
forth
from
a
rack
of
heavy
clouds
,
the
appearance
of
these
personages
was
not
much
in
their
favour
.
<EOS>
Haggard
features
,
stamped
deeply
with
the
characters
of
crime
and
debauchery
;
fierce
,
restless
eyes
;
beards
of
several
days
'
growth
;
wild
,
unkempt
heads
of
hair
,
formed
their
chief
personal
characteristics
;
while
sordid
and
ragged
clothes
;
shoes
without
soles
;
and
old
hats
without
crowns
,
constituted
the
sum
of
their
apparel
.
 
<EOS>
One
of
them
was
tall
and
gaunt
,
with
large
hands
and
feet
;
but
despite
his
meagreness
,
he
evidently
possessed
great
strength
:
the
other
was
considerably
shorter
,
but
broad
-
shouldered
,
bow
-
legged
,
long
-
armed
,
and
altogether
a
most
formidable
ruffian
.
<EOS>
This
fellow
had
high
cheekbones
,
a
long
aquiline
nose
,
and
a
coarse
mouth
and
chin
,
in
which
the
animal
greatly
predominated
.
<EOS>
He
had
a
stubby
red
beard
,
with
sandy
hair
,
white
brows
and
eyelashes
.
<EOS>
The
countenance
of
the
other
was
dark
and
repulsive
,
and
covered
with
blotches
,
the
result
of
habitual
intemperance
.
<EOS>
His
eyes
had
a
leering
and
malignant
look
.
<EOS>
A
handkerchief
spotted
with
blood
,
and
tied
across
his
brow
,
contrasted
strongly
with
his
matted
black
hair
,
and
increased
his
natural
appearance
of
ferocity
.
<EOS>
The
shorter
ruffian
carried
a
mallet
upon
his
shoulder
,
and
his
companion
concealed
something
beneath
the
breast
of
his
coat
,
which
afterwards
proved
to
be
a
dark
lantern
.
 
<EOS>
Not
a
word
passed
between
them
;
but
keeping
a
vigilant
look
-
out
,
they
trudged
on
with
quick
,
shambling
steps
.
<EOS>
A
few
sounds
arose
from
the
banks
of
the
river
,
and
there
was
now
and
then
a
plash
in
the
water
,
or
a
distant
cry
,
betokening
some
passing
craft
;
but
generally
all
was
profoundly
still
.
<EOS>
The
quaint
,
Dutch
-
looking
structures
on
the
opposite
bank
,
the
line
of
coal
-
barges
and
lighters
moored
to
the
strand
,
the
great
timber
-
yards
and
coal
-
yards
,
the
brewhouses
,
gasworks
,
and
waterworks
,
could
only
be
imperfectly
discerned
;
but
the
moonlight
fell
clear
upon
the
ancient
towers
of
Lambeth
Palace
,
and
on
the
neighbouring
church
.
<EOS>
The
same
glimmer
also
ran
like
a
silver
belt
across
the
stream
,
and
revealed
the
great
,
stern
,
fortress
-
like
pile
of
the
Penitentiary
--
perhaps
the
most
dismal
-
looking
structure
in
the
whole
metropolis
.
<EOS>
The
world
of
habitations
beyond
this
melancholy
prison
were
buried
in
darkness
.
<EOS>
The
two
men
,
however
,
thought
nothing
of
these
things
,
and
saw
nothing
of
them
;
but
,
on
arriving
within
a
couple
of
hundred
yards
of
the
bridge
,
suddenly
,
as
if
by
previous
concert
,
quitted
the
road
,
and
,
leaping
a
rail
,
ran
across
a
field
,
and
plunged
into
a
hollow
formed
by
a
dried
pit
,
where
they
came
to
a
momentary
halt
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
ai
n't
a
-
been
<EOS>
a
-
gammonin
'
me
in
this
matter
,
Tinker

<EOS>
"
observed
the
shorter
individual
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
cove
's
sure
to
come
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
you
ca
n't
expect
me
to
answer
for
another
as
I
can
for
myself
,
Sandman
,
"
replied
the
other
;
"
but
if
his
own
word
's
to
be
taken
for
it
,
he
's
sartin
to
be
there
.
<EOS>
I
heerd
him
say
,
as
plainly
as
I
'm
a-
<EOS>
speakin
'
to
you,--'I'll
be
here
tomorrow
night
at
the
same
hour--
'
"
 
"
<EOS>
And
that
wos
one
o'clock
?
"
said
the
Sandman
.
 
<EOS>
"
Thereabouts
,
"
replied
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
who
did
he
say
that
to
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
the
Sandman
.
 
<EOS>
"
To
hisself
,
I
s'pose
,
"
answered
the
Tinker
;
"
for
,
as
I
told
you
afore
,
I
could
see
no
one
vith
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Do
you
think
he
's
one
of
our
perfession
?
"
inquired
the
Sandman
.
 
<EOS>
"
Bless
you
!
<EOS>
no
--
that
he
hain't
,
"
returned
the
Tinker
.
<EOS>
"
He
's
a
reg'lar
slap
-
up
swell
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
no
reason
at
all
,
"
said
the
Sandman
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Many
a
first
-
rate
svell
practises
in
our
line
.
<EOS>
But
he
ca
n't
be
in
his
right
mind
to
come
to
such
a
ken
as
that
,
and
go
on
as
you
mentions
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
As
to
that
I
ca
n't
say
,
"
replied
the
Tinker
;
"
and
it
do
n't
much
matter
,
as
far
as
ve're
consarned
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Devil
a
bit
,
"
rejoined
the
Sandman
,
"
except
--
you're
sure
it
worn't
<EOS>
a
sperrit
,
Tinker
.
<EOS>
I
've
heerd
say
that
this
crib
is
haanted
,
and
though
I
do
n't
fear
no
livin
'
man
,
<EOS>
a
ghost
's
a
different
sort
of
customer
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Vell
,
you
'll
find
our
svell
raal
flesh
and
blood
,
you
may
depend
upon
it
,
"
replied
the
Tinker
.
"
<EOS>
So
come
along
,
and
do
n't
let
's
be
frightenin
'
<EOS>
ourselves
vith
ould
vimen
's
tales
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
With
this
they
emerged
from
the
pit
,
crossed
the
lower
part
of
the
field
,
and
entered
a
narrow
thoroughfare
,
skirted
by
a
few
detached
houses
,
which
brought
them
into
the
Vauxhall
-
bridge
road
.
 
<EOS>
Here
they
kept
on
the
side
of
the
street
most
in
shadow
,
and
crossed
over
whenever
they
came
to
a
lamp
.
<EOS>
By
-
and
-
by
,
two
watchmen
were
seen
advancing
from
Belvoir
-
terrace
,
and
,
as
the
guardians
of
the
night
drew
near
,
the
ruffians
crept
into
an
alley
to
let
them
pass
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
the
coast
was
clear
,
they
ventured
forth
,
and
quickening
their
pace
,
came
to
a
row
of
deserted
and
dilapidated
houses
.
<EOS>
This
was
their
destination
.
 
<EOS>
The
range
of
habitations
in
question
,
more
than
a
dozen
in
number
,
were
,
in
all
probability
,
what
is
vulgarly
called
"
in
Chancery
"
,
and
shared
the
fate
of
most
property
similarly
circumstanced
.
<EOS>
They
were
in
a
sad
ruinous
state
--
unroofed
,
without
windows
and
floors
.
<EOS>
The
bare
walls
were
alone
left
standing
,
and
these
were
in
a
very
tumbledown
condition
.
<EOS>
These
neglected
dwellings
served
as
receptacles
for
old
iron
,
blocks
of
stone
and
wood
,
and
other
ponderous
matters
.
<EOS>
The
aspect
of
the
whole
place
was
so
dismal
and
suspicious
,
that
it
was
generally
avoided
by
passengers
after
nightfall
.
 
<EOS>
Skulking
along
the
blank
and
dreary
walls
,
the
Tinker
,
who
was
now
a
little
in
advance
,
stopped
before
a
door
,
and
pushing
it
open
,
entered
the
dwelling
.
<EOS>
His
companion
followed
him
.
 
<EOS>
The
extraordinary
and
incongruous
assemblage
of
objects
which
met
the
gaze
of
the
Sandman
,
coupled
with
the
deserted
appearance
of
the
place
,
produced
an
effect
upon
his
hardy
but
superstitious
nature
.
 
<EOS>
Looking
round
,
he
beheld
huge
mill
-
stones
,
enormous
water
-
wheels
,
boilers
of
steam
-
engines
,
iron
vats
,
cylinders
,
cranes
,
iron
pumps
of
the
strangest
fashion
,
a
gigantic
pair
of
wooden
scales
,
old
iron
safes
,
old
boilers
,
old
gas
-
pipes
,
old
water
-
pipes
,
cracked
old
bells
,
old
birdcages
,
old
plates
of
iron
,
old
pulleys
,
ropes
,
and
rusty
chains
,
huddled
and
heaped
together
in
the
most
fantastic
disorder
.
<EOS>
In
the
midst
of
the
chaotic
mass
frowned
the
bearded
and
colossal
head
of
Neptune
,
which
had
once
decorated
the
forepart
of
a
man
-
of
-
war
.
<EOS>
Above
it
,
on
a
sort
of
framework
,
lay
the
prostrate
statue
of
a
nymph
,
together
with
a
bust
of
Fox
,
the
nose
of
the
latter
being
partly
demolished
,
and
the
eyes
knocked
in
.
<EOS>
Above
these
,
three
garden
divinities
laid
their
heads
amicably
together
.
<EOS>
On
the
left
stood
a
tall
Grecian
warrior
,
minus
the
head
and
right
hand
.
<EOS>
The
whole
was
surmounted
by
an
immense
ventilator
,
stuck
on
the
end
of
an
iron
rod
,
ascending
,
like
a
lightning
-
conductor
,
from
the
steam
-
engine
pump
.
 
<EOS>
Seen
by
the
transient
light
of
the
moon
,
the
various
objects
above
enumerated
produced
a
strange
effect
upon
the
beholder
's
imagination
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
mixture
of
the
grotesque
and
terrible
about
them
.
<EOS>
Nor
was
the
building
itself
devoid
of
a
certain
influence
upon
his
mind
.
<EOS>
The
ragged
brickwork
,
over
-
grown
with
weeds
,
took
with
him
the
semblance
of
a
human
face
,
and
seemed
to
keep
a
wary
eye
on
what
was
going
forward
below
.
 
<EOS>
A
means
of
crossing
from
one
side
of
the
building
to
the
other
,
without
descending
into
the
vault
beneath
,
was
afforded
by
a
couple
of
planks
;
though
as
the
wall
on
the
farther
side
was
some
feet
higher
than
that
near
at
hand
,
and
the
planks
were
considerably
bent
,
the
passage
appeared
hazardous
.
 
<EOS>
Glancing
round
for
a
moment
,
the
Tinker
leaped
into
the
cellar
,
and
,
unmasking
his
lantern
,
showed
a
sort
of
hiding
-
place
,
between
a
bulk
of
timber
and
a
boiler
,
to
which
he
invited
his
companion
.
 
<EOS>
The
Sandman
jumped
down
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
ale
I
drank
at
the
'
Two
Fighting
Cocks
'
has
made
me
feel
drowsy
,
Tinker
,
"
he
remarked
,
stretching
himself
on
the
bulk
;
"
I
'll
just
take
a
snooze
.
<EOS>
Vake
me
up
if
I
snore
--
or
ven
our
sperrit
appears
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
The
Tinker
replied
in
the
affirmative
;
and
the
other
had
just
become
lost
to
consciousness
,
when
he
received
a
nudge
in
the
side
,
and
his
companion
whispered--"He
's
here
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Vhere
--
vhere
?
"
demanded
the
Sandman
,
in
some
trepidation
.
 
<EOS>
"
Look
up
,
and
you
'll
see
him
,
"
replied
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
Slightly
altering
his
position
,
the
Sandman
caught
sight
of
a
figure
standing
upon
the
planks
above
them
.
<EOS>
It
was
that
of
a
young
man
.
<EOS>
His
hat
was
off
,
and
his
features
,
exposed
to
the
full
radiance
of
the
moon
,
looked
deathly
pale
,
and
though
handsome
,
had
a
strange
sinister
expression
.
<EOS>
He
was
tall
,
slight
,
and
well
-
proportioned
;
and
the
general
cut
of
his
attire
,
the
tightly
buttoned
,
single
-
breasted
coat
,
together
with
the
moustache
upon
his
lip
,
gave
him
a
military
air
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
seems
a
-
valkin
'
in
his
sleep
,
"
muttered
the
Sandman
.
<EOS>
"
He
's
a-
<EOS>
speakin
'
to
some
von
unwisible
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Hush
hush
!
"
whispered
the
other
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Let
's
hear
wot
he
's
a
-
sayin
'
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Why
have
you
brought
me
here
?
<EOS>
"
cried
the
young
man
,
in
a
voice
so
hollow
that
it
thrilled
his
auditors
.
<EOS>
"
What
is
to
be
done
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
makes
my
blood
run
cold
to
hear
him
,
"
whispered
the
Sandman
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Vot
d'ye
think
he
sees
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Why
do
you
not
speak
to
me
?
"
cried
the
young
man--"why
<EOS>
do
you
beckon
me
forward
?
<EOS>
Well
,
I
obey
.
<EOS>
I
will
follow
you
.
"
<EOS>
And
he
moved
slowly
across
the
plank
.
 
<EOS>
"
See
,
he
's
a
-
goin
'
through
that
door
,
"
cried
the
Tinker
.
<EOS>
"
Let
's
foller
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
half
like
it
,
"
replied
the
Sandman
,
his
teeth
chattering
with
apprehension
.
<EOS>
"
We
shall
see
summat
as'll
take
avay
our
senses
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Tut
!
"
cried
the
Tinker
;
"
it
's
only
a
sleepy
-
valker
.
<EOS>
Wot
are
you
afeerd
on
?
"
 
<EOS>
With
this
he
vaulted
upon
the
planks
,
and
peeping
cautiously
out
of
the
open
door
to
which
they
led
,
saw
the
object
of
his
scrutiny
enter
the
adjoining
house
through
a
broken
window
.
 
<EOS>
Making
a
sign
to
the
Sandman
,
who
was
close
at
his
heels
,
the
Tinker
crept
forward
on
all
fours
,
and
,
on
reaching
the
window
,
raised
himself
just
sufficiently
to
command
the
interior
of
the
dwelling
.
<EOS>
Unfortunately
for
him
,
the
moon
was
at
this
moment
obscured
,
and
he
could
distinguish
nothing
except
the
dusky
outline
of
the
various
objects
with
which
the
place
was
filled
,
and
which
were
nearly
of
the
same
kind
as
those
of
the
neighbouring
habitation
.
<EOS>
He
listened
intently
,
but
not
the
slightest
sound
reached
his
ears
.
 
<EOS>
After
some
time
spent
in
this
way
,
he
began
to
fear
the
young
man
must
have
departed
,
when
all
at
once
a
piercing
scream
resounded
through
the
dwelling
.
<EOS>
Some
heavy
matter
was
dislodged
,
with
a
thundering
crash
,
and
footsteps
were
heard
approaching
the
window
.
 
<EOS>
Hastily
retreating
to
their
former
hiding
-
place
,
the
Tinker
and
his
companion
had
scarcely
regained
it
,
when
the
young
man
again
appeared
on
the
plank
.
<EOS>
His
demeanour
had
undergone
a
fearful
change
.
<EOS>
He
staggered
rather
than
walked
,
and
his
countenance
was
even
paler
than
before
.
<EOS>
Having
crossed
the
plank
,
he
took
his
way
along
the
top
of
the
broken
wall
towards
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
,
then
,
Sandman
!
"
cried
the
Tinker
;
"
now
's
your
time
!
"
 
<EOS>
The
other
nodded
,
and
,
grasping
his
mallet
with
a
deadly
and
determined
purpose
,
sprang
noiselessly
upon
the
wall
,
and
overtook
his
intended
victim
just
before
he
gained
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
Hearing
a
sound
behind
him
,
the
young
man
turned
,
and
only
just
became
conscious
of
the
presence
of
the
Sandman
,
when
the
mallet
descended
upon
his
head
,
and
he
fell
crushed
and
senseless
to
the
ground
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
work
's
done
!
"
cried
the
Sandman
to
his
companion
,
who
instantly
came
up
with
the
dark
lantern
;
"
let
's
take
him
below
,
and
strip
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Agreed
,
"
replied
the
Tinker
;
"
but
first
let
's
see
wot
he
has
got
in
his
pockets
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Vith
all
my
'
art
<EOS>
,
"
replied
the
Sandman
,
searching
the
clothes
of
the
victim
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
reader!--I
hope
it
's
well
lined
.
<EOS>
We
'll
examine
it
below
.
<EOS>
The
body
'
ud
tell
awkvard
tales
if
any
von
should
chance
to
peep
in
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Shall
we
strip
him
here
?
"
said
the
Tinker
.
<EOS>
"
Now
the
darkey
shines
on
'em
,
you
see
what
famous
togs
the
cull
has
on
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Do
you
vant
to
have
us
scragged
,
fool
?
<EOS>
"
cried
the
Sandman
,
springing
into
the
vault
<EOS>
"
Hoist
him
down
here
.
"
 
<EOS>
With
this
,
he
placed
the
wounded
man
's
legs
over
his
own
shoulders
,
and
,
aided
by
his
comrade
,
was
in
the
act
of
heaving
down
the
body
,
when
the
street
-
door
suddenly
flew
open
,
and
a
stout
individual
,
attended
by
a
couple
of
watchmen
,
appeared
at
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
the
villains
are
!
"
shouted
the
newcomer
.
<EOS>
They
have
been
murderin
'
a
gentleman
.
<EOS>
Seize
'
em
--
seize
'
em
!
"
 
<EOS>
And
,
as
he
spoke
,
he
discharged
a
pistol
,
the
ball
from
which
whistled
past
the
ears
of
the
Tinker
.
 
<EOS>
Without
waiting
for
another
salute
of
the
same
kind
,
which
might
possibly
be
nearer
<EOS>
its
mark
<EOS>
,
the
ruffian
kicked
the
lantern
into
the
vault
,
and
sprang
after
the
Sandman
,
who
had
already
disappeared
.
 
<EOS>
Acquainted
with
the
intricacies
of
the
place
,
the
Tinker
guided
his
companion
through
a
hole
into
an
adjoining
vault
,
whence
they
scaled
a
wail
,
got
into
the
next
house
,
and
passing
through
an
open
window
,
made
good
their
retreat
,
while
the
watchmen
were
vainly
searching
for
them
under
every
bulk
and
piece
of
iron
.
 
<EOS>
"
Here
,
watchmen
!
<EOS>
"
cried
the
stout
individual
,
who
had
acted
as
leader
;
"
never
mind
the
villains
just
now
,
but
help
me
to
convey
this
poor
young
gentleman
to
my
house
,
where
proper
assistance
can
be
rendered
him
.
<EOS>
He
still
breathes
;
but
he
has
received
a
terrible
blow
on
the
head
.
<EOS>
I
hope
his
skull
ai
n't
broken
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
to
be
hoped
it
ai
n't
,
Mr.
Thorneycroft
,
"
replied
the
foremost
watchman
;
"
but
them
was
two
desperate
characters
,
as
ever
I
see
,
and
capable
of
any
ahtterosity
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
a
frightful
scream
I
heard
to
be
sure
!
"
cried
Mr.
Thorneycroft
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
certain
sornethin
'
dreadful
was
goin'
on
.
<EOS>
It
was
fortunate
<EOS>
I
was
n't
gone
to
bed
;
and
still
more
fortunate
you
happened
to
be
comin
'
up
at
the
time
.
<EOS>
But
we
must
n't
stand
chatterin
'
here
.
<EOS>
Bring
the
poor
young
gentleman
along
.
"
 
<EOS>
Preceded
by
Mr.
Thorneycroft
,
the
watchmen
carried
the
wounded
man
across
the
road
towards
a
small
house
,
the
door
of
which
was
held
open
by
a
female
servant
,
with
a
candle
in
her
band
.
<EOS>
The
poor
woman
uttered
a
cry
of
horror
as
the
body
was
brought
in
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
be
cryin
'
out
in
that
way
,
Peggy
,
"
cried
Mr.
Thorneycroft
,
"
but
go
and
get
me
some
brandy
.
<EOS>
Here
,
watchmen
,
lay
the
poor
young
gentleman
down
on
the
sofa
--
there
,
gently
,
gently
.
<EOS>
And
now
,
one
of
you
run
to
Wheeler
-
street
,
and
fetch
Mr.
Howell
,
the
surgeon
.
<EOS>
Less
noise
,
Peggy
--
less
noise
,
or
you
'll
waken
Miss
Ebba
,
and
I
would
n't
have
her
disturbed
for
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
With
this
,
he
snatched
the
bottle
of
brandy
from
the
maid
filled
a
wine
-
glass
with
the
spirit
,
and
poured
it
down
the
throat
of
the
wounded
man
.
<EOS>
A
stifling
sound
followed
,
and
after
struggling
violently
for
respiration
for
a
few
seconds
,
the
patient
opened
his
eyes
.

<EOS>
THE
DOG
-
FANCIER
 
<EOS>
The
Rookery
!
<EOS>
Who
that
has
passed
Saint
Giles
's
,
on
the
way
to
the
city
,
or
corning
from
it
,
but
has
caught
a
glimpse
,
through
some
narrow
opening
,
of
its
squalid
habitations
,
and
wretched
and
ruffianly
occupants
!
<EOS>
Who
but
must
have
been
struck
with
amazement
,
that
such
a
huge
receptacle
of
vice
and
crime
should
be
allowed
to
exist
in
the
very
heart
of
the
metropolis
,
like
an
ulcerated
spot
,
capable
of
tainting
the
whole
system
!
<EOS>
Of
late
,
the
progress
of
improvement
has
caused
its
removal
;
but
whether
any
less
cogent
motive
would
have
abated
the
nuisance
,
may
be
questioned
.
<EOS>
For
years
the
evil
was
felt
,
and
complained
of
,
but
no
effort
was
made
to
remedy
it
,
or
to
cleanse
these
worse
than
Augean
stables
.
<EOS>
As
the
place
is
now
partially
,
if
not
altogether
,
swept
away
,
and
a
wide
and
airy
street
passes
through
the
midst
of
its
foul
recesses
,
a
slight
sketch
may
be
given
of
its
former
appearance
.
 
<EOS>
Entering
a
narrow
street
,
guarded
by
posts
and
crossbars
,
a
few
steps
from
the
crowded
thoroughfare
brought
you
into
a
frightful
region
,
the
refuge
,
it
was
easy
to
perceive
,
of
half
the
lawless
characters
infesting
the
metropolis
.
<EOS>
The
coarsest
ribaldry
assailed
your
ears
,
and
noisome
odours
afflicted
your
sense
of
smell
.
<EOS>
As
you
advanced
,
picking
your
way
through
kennels
flowing
with
filth
,
or
over
putrescent
heaps
of
rubbish
and
oyster
-
shells
,
all
the
repulsive
and
hideous
features
of
the
place
were
displayed
before
you
.
<EOS>
There
was
something
savagely
picturesque
in
the
aspect
of
the
place
,
but
its
features
were
too
loathsome
to
be
regarded
with
any
other
feeling
than
disgust
.
<EOS>
The
houses
looked
as
sordid
,
and
as
thickly
crusted
with
the
leprosy
of
vice
,
as
their
tenants
.
<EOS>
Horrible
habitations
they
were
,
in
truth
.
<EOS>
Many
of
them
were
without
windows
,
and
where
the
frames
were
left
,
brown
paper
or
tin
supplied
the
place
of
glass
;
some
even
wanted
doors
,
and
no
effort
was
made
to
conceal
the
squalor
within
.
<EOS>
On
the
contrary
,
it
seemed
to
be
intruded
on
observation
.
<EOS>
Miserable
rooms
,
almost
destitute
of
furniture
;
floors
and
walls
caked
with
dirt
,
or
decked
with
coarse
flaring
prints
;
shameless
and
abandoned
-
looking
women
;
children
without
shoes
and
stockings
,
and
with
scarcely
a
rag
to
their
backs
:
these
were
the
chief
objects
that
met
the
view
.
<EOS>
Of
men
,
few
were
visible
--
the
majority
being
out
on
business
<EOS>
,
it
is
to
be
presumed
;
but
where
a
solitary
straggler
was
seen
,
his
sinister
looks
and
<EOS>
mean
attire
were
in
perfect
keeping
with
the
spot
.
<EOS>
So
thickly
inhabited
were
these
wretched
dwellings
,
that
every
chamber
,
from
garret
to
cellar
,
swarmed
with
inmates
.
<EOS>
As
to
the
cellars
,
they
looked
like
dismal
caverns
,
which
a
wild
beast
would
shun
.
<EOS>
Clothes
-
lines
were
hung
from
house
to
house
,
festooned
with
every
kind
of
garment
.
<EOS>
Out
of
the
main
street
branched
several
alleys
and
passages
,
all
displaying
the
same
degree
of
misery
,
or
,
if
possible
,
worse
,
and
teeming
with
occupants
.
<EOS>
Personal
security
,
however
,
forbade
any
attempt
to
track
these
labyrinths
;
but
imagination
,
after
the
specimen
afforded
,
could
easily
picture
them
.
<EOS>
It
was
impossible
to
move
a
step
without
insult
or
annoyance
.
<EOS>
Every
human
being
seemed
brutalised
and
degraded
;
and
the
women
appeared
utterly
lost
to
decency
,
and
made
the
street
ring
with
their
cries
,
their
quarrels
,
and
their
imprecations
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
positive
relief
to
escape
from
this
hotbed
of
crime
to
the
world
without
,
and
breathe
a
purer
atmosphere
.
 
<EOS>
Such
being
the
aspect
of
the
Rookery
in
the
daytime
,
what
must
it
have
been
when
crowded
with
its
denizens
at
night
!
<EOS>
Yet
at
such
an
hour
it
will
now
be
necessary
to
enter
its
penetralia
.
 
<EOS>
After
escaping
from
the
ruined
house
in
the
Vauxhall
-
road
,
the
two
ruffians
shaped
their
course
towards
Saint
Giles
's
,
running
the
greater
part
of
the
way
,
and
reaching
the
Broadway
Just
as
the
church
clock
struck
two
.
<EOS>
Darting
into
a
narrow
alley
,
and
heedless
of
any
obstructions
they
encountered
in
their
path
,
they
entered
a
somewhat
wider
cross
-
street
,
which
they
pursued
for
a
short
distance
,
and
then
struck
into
an
entry
,
at
the
bottom
of
which
was
a
swing
door
that
admitted
them
into
a
small
court
,
where
they
found
a
dwarfish
person
wrapped
in
a
tattered
watchman
's
great
-
coat
,
seated
on
a
stool
with
a
horn
lantern
in
his
hand
and
a
cutty
in
his
mouth
,
the
glow
of
which
lighted
up
his
hard
,
withered
features
.
<EOS>
This
was
the
deputy
-
porter
of
the
lodging
-
house
<EOS>
they
were
about
to
enter
.
<EOS>
Addressing
him
by
the
name
of
Old
Parr
,
the
ruffians
passed
on
,
and
lifting
the
latch
of
another
door
,
entered
a
sort
of
kitchen
,
at
the
farther
end
of
which
blazed
a
cheerful
fire
,
with
a
large
copper
kettle
boiling
upon
it
.
<EOS>
On
one
side
of
the
room
was
a
deal
table
,
round
which
several
men
of
sinister
aspect
and
sordid
attire
were
collected
,
playing
at
cards
.
<EOS>
A
smaller
table
of
the
same
material
stood
near
the
fire
,
and
opposite
it
was
a
staircase
leading
to
the
upper
rooms
.
<EOS>
The
place
was
dingy
and
dirty
in
the
extreme
,
the
floors
could
not
have
been
scoured
for
years
,
and
the
walls
were
begrimed
with
filth
.
<EOS>
In
one
corner
,
with
his
head
resting
on
a
heap
of
coals
and
coke
,
lay
a
boy
almost
as
black
as
a
chimney-
sweep
,
fast
asleep
.
<EOS>
He
was
the
waiter
.
<EOS>
The
principal
light
was
afforded
by
a
candle
stuck
against
the
wall
,
with
a
tin
reflector
behind
it
.
<EOS>
Before
the
fire
,
with
his
back
turned
towards
it
,
stood
a
noticeable
individual
,
clad
in
a
velveteen
jacket
,
with
ivory
buttons
,
a
striped
waistcoat
,
drab
knees
,
a
faded
black
silk
neckcloth
tied
in
a
great
bow
,
and
a
pair
of
ancient
Wellingtons
ascending
half
-
way
up
his
legs
,
which
looked
disproportionately
thin
when
compared
with
the
upper
part
of
his
square
,
robustious
,
and
somewhat
pursy
frame
.
<EOS>
His
face
was
broad
,
jolly
,
and
good
-
humoured
,
with
a
bottle
-
shaped
nose
,
fleshy
lips
,
and
light
grey
eyes
,
glistening
with
cunning
and
roguery
.
<EOS>
His
hair
,
which
dangled
in
long
flakes
over
his
ears
and
neck
,
was
of
a
dunnish
red
,
as
were
also
his
whiskers
and
beard
.
<EOS>
A
superannuated
white
castor
,
with
a
black
hatband
round
it
,
was
cocked
knowingly
on
one
side
of
his
head
,
and
gave
him
a
flashy
and
sporting
look
.
<EOS>
His
particular
vocation
was
made
manifest
by
the
number
of
dogs
he
had
about
him
.
<EOS>
A
beautiful
black
-
tan
spaniel
,
of
Charles
<EOS>
the
Second
's
breed
,
popped
its
short
snubby
nose
and
long
silken
ears
out
of
each
coat
-
pocket
.
<EOS>
A
pug
was
thrust
into
his
breast
,
and
he
carried
an
exquisite
Blenheim
under
either
arm
.
<EOS>
At
his
feet
reposed
an
Isle
of
Skye
terrier
,
and
a
partly
cropped
French
poodle
,
of
snowy
whiteness
,
with
a
red
worsted
riband
round
his
throat
.
<EOS>
This
person
,
it
need
scarcely
be
said
,
was
a
dog
-
fancier
,
or
,
in
other
words
,
a
dealer
in
,
and
a
stealer
of
dogs
,
as
well
as
a
practiser
of
all
the
tricks
connected
with
that
nefarious
trade
.
<EOS>
His
self
-
satisfied
air
made
it
evident
he
thought
himself
a
smart
clever
fellow,--and
adroit
and
knavish
<EOS>
he
was
,
no
doubt,--while
his
droll
,
plausible
,
and
rather
winning
manners
,
helped
him
materially
to
impose
upon
his
customers
.
<EOS>
His
real
name
was
Taylor
,
but
he
was
known
among
his
companions
by
the
appellation
of
Ginger
.
<EOS>
On
the
entrance
of
the
Sandman
and
the
Tinker
,
he
nodded
familiarly
to
them
,
and
with
a
sly
look
inquired--"Vell
,
my
'
arties
--
wot
luck
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
pretty
middling
'
,
"
replied
the
Sandman
,
gruffly
.
 
<EOS>
And
seating
himself
at
the
table
,
near
the
fire
,
he
kicked
up
the
lad
,
who
was
lying
fast
asleep
on
the
coals
,
and
bade
him
<EOS>
fetch
a
pot
of
half
-
and
-
half
.
<EOS>
The
Tinker
took
a
place
beside
him
,
and
they
waited
in
silence
the
arrival
of
the
liquor
,
which
,
when
it
came
,
was
disposed
of
at
a
couple
of
pulls
;
while
Mr.
Ginger
,
seeing
they
were
engaged
,
sauntered
towards
the
card
-
table
,
attended
by
his
four
-
footed
companions
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
now
,
"
said
the
Sandman
,
unable
to
control
his
curiosity
longer
,
and
taking
out
his
pocket
-
book
,
<EOS>
"
we
'll
see
what
fortun
'
has
given
us
.
"
 
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
unclasped
the
pocket
-
book
,
while
the
Tinker
bent
over
him
in
eager
curiosity
.
<EOS>
But
their
search
for
money
was
fruitless
.
<EOS>
Not
a
single
bank
-
note
was
forthcoming
.
<EOS>
There
were
several
memoranda
and
slips
of
paper
,
a
few
cards
,
and
an
almanack
for
the
year
--
that
was
,
all
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
great
disappointment
.
 
<EOS>
"
So
we
've
had
all
this
trouble
for
nuffin
'
,
and
nearly
got
shot
into
the
bargain
,
"
cried
the
Sandman
,
slapping
down
the
book
on
the
table
with
an
oath
.
<EOS>
"
I
vish
I
'd
never
undertaken
the
job
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
let
's
give
it
up
in
sich
an
'
urry
,
"
replied
the
Tinker
;
"
summat
may
be
made
on
it
yet
.
<EOS>
Let
's
look
over
them
papers
.
<EOS>
"
 
"
Look
'em
over
yourself
,
"
rejoined
the
Sandman
,
pushing
the
book
towards
him
.
<EOS>
"
I
've
done
wi
'
'em
.
<EOS>
Here
,
lazy
-
bones
,
bring
two
glasses
'
<EOS>
o
'
rum
-
and
-
water
--
stiff
,
d'ye
hear
?
"
 
<EOS>
While
the
sleepy
youth
bestirred
himself
to
obey
these
injunctions
,
the
Tinker
read
over
every
memorandum
in
the
pocket
-
book
,
and
then
proceeded
carefully
to
examine
the
different
scraps
of
paper
with
which
it
was
filled
.
<EOS>
Not
content
with
one
perusal
,
he
looked
them
all
over
again
,
and
then
began
to
rub
his
hands
with
great
glee
.
 
<EOS>
"
Wot
's
the
matter
?
"
<EOS>
cried
the
Sandman
,
who
had
lighted
a
cutty
,
and
was
quietly
smoking
it
.
<EOS>
"
Wot
's
the
row
,
eh
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Vy
,
this
is
it
,
"
replied
the
Tinker
,
unable
to
contain
his
satisfaction
;
"
there
's
secrets
contained
in
this
here
pocket
-
book
as'll
be
worth
a
hundred
pound
and
better
to
us
.
<EOS>
We
ha'n't
had
our
trouble
for
nuffin
'
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Glad
to
hear
it
!
"
said
the
Sandman
,
looking
hard
at
him

"
replied
the
Tinker
,
with
mysterious
emphasis
.
"
<EOS>
He
seems
to
be
a
terrible
chap
,
and
to
have
committed
murder
wholesale
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Wholesale
!
"
echoed
the
Sandman
,
removing
the
pipe
from
his
lips
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
That
sounds
awful
.
<EOS>
But
what
a
precious
donkey
he
must
be
to
register
his
crimes
<EOS>
i
'
that
way
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
did
n't
expect
the

book
to
fall
into
our

,
"
said
the
Tinker
.
 
<EOS>
"
Werry
likely
not
,
"
replied
the
Sandman
;
"
but
somebody
else
might
see
it
.
<EOS>
I
repeat
,
he
must
be
a
fool
.
<EOS>
S'pose
we
wos
to
make
a
entry
of
everythin

<EOS>
Wot
a

<EOS>
there

"
 
<EOS>
"
Ourn
is

replied
the

"
This

Wot
age
should
you

"
Vy

"
Five

There

"
 
<EOS>
"
Five

an'-sixty

<EOS>
"
cried
the

;
"
there
must
be
some
mistake
<EOS>
i

the

there
.
"
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
it
's
all
clear
an
'
reg'lar
,
"
rejoined
the
other
;
"
and
that
does
n't
seem
to
be
the
end
of
it
neither
.
<EOS>
I
looked
over
the
papers
twice
,
and
one
,
dated
1780
,
refers
to
some
other
dokiments
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
They
must
relate
to
his
granddad
,
then
,
"
said
the
Sandman
;
"
it
's
impossible
they
can
refer
to
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
I
tell
'
ee
they
do
refer
to
him
,
"
said
the
Tinker
,
somewhat
angrily
,
at
having
his
assertion
denied
;
"
at
least
,
if
his
own
word
's
to
be
taken
.
<EOS>
Anyhow
,
these
papers
is
waluable
to
us
.
<EOS>
If
no
one
else
believes
in
'em
,
it
's
clear
he
believes
in
'em
hisself
,

will
be
glad
to
buy
'em
from
us

"
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
a
view
<EOS>
o
'
the
case
worthy
of
an
Old
Bailey
lawyer
,
"
replied
the
Sandman
.
<EOS>
"
Wot
's
the
gemman
's
name
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
name
on
the
card
is
Auriol
Darcy

"
replied
the
Tinker
.
 
<EOS>
"
Any
address
?
<EOS>
"
asked
the
Sandman
.
 
<EOS>
The
Tinker
shook
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
unlucky
agin
,
"
said
the
Sandman
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ai
n't
there
<EOS>
no

o

clue
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
None
votiver
,
as
I

<EOS>
"
Vy

zounds
,
then
,
ve're
jist

cried
the

<EOS>
"
But
it
do
n't
matter
.
<EOS>
There
's
not
much
chance
<EOS>
o

makin
'
a
bargin
vith
him

<EOS>
The
crak
o

<EOS>
the

done
his

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Nuffin
'
o

"
replied
the
Tinker

"
<EOS>
He
alvays
recovers
from
every
kind
of
accident

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Alvays
recovers

"
exclaimed
the
Sandman
,
in
amazement
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Wot
a
constitootion
he
must
have
.
"
 
"
Surprisin
'
!
"
replied
the
Tinker
;
"
he
never
suffers
from
injuries
--
at
least
,
not
much
;
never
grows
old
;
and
never
expects
to
die
;
for
he
mentions
wot
<EOS>
he
intends
doin'
a
hundred
years
hence
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
he
's
a
lu
-
nattic
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
Sandman
,
"
a
downright
lu
-
nattic
;
and
that
accounts
for
his
wisitin
'
that
'
ere
ruined
house
,
and
a-
fancyin
'
<EOS>
he
heerd
some
one
talk
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
's
mad
,
depend
upon
it

<EOS>
That
is
,
if
I
ai
n't
cured
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
'
I
'm
of
a
different
opinion
,
"
said
the
Tinker
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
so
am
I
,
"
said
Mr.
Ginger
,
who
had
approached
unobserved
,
and
overheard
the
greater
part
of
their
discourse
.
 
<EOS>
"
Vy
,
vot
<EOS>
can
you
know
about
it
,
Ginger
?
"
said
the
Sandman
,
looking
up
,
evidently
rather
annoyed
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
only
know
this
,
"
replied
Ginger
,
"
that
you
've
got
a
good
case
,
and
if
you
'll
let
me
into
it
,
I
'll
engage
to
make
summat
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Vell
,
I
'm
agreeable
,
"
said
the
Sandman
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
so
am
I
,
"
added
the
Tinker
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
that
I
pays
much
regard
to
wot
<EOS>
you
've
bin
a
readin
'
in
his
papers
,
"
pursued
Ginger
;
<EOS>
"
the
gemman
's
evidently
half
-
cracked
,
if
he
ai
n't
cracked
altogether
--
but
he
's
jist
the
person
to
work
upon
.
<EOS>
He
fancies
hisself
immortal
--
eh
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Exactly
so
,
"
replied
the
Tinker
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
he
also
fancies
he
's
'
committed
a
lot
o
'
murders
?
<EOS>
"
pursued
Ginger
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
desperate
lot
,
"
replied
the
Tinker
.
 
<EOS>
"
Then
he
'll
be
glad
to
buy
those
papers
at
any
price
,
"
said
Ginger
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ve'll
deal
vith
him
in
regard
to
the
pocketbook
,
as
I
deals
vith
regard
to
a
dog
--
ask
a
price
for
its
restitootion
.
"
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
must
find
him
out
first
,
"
said
the
Sandman
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
's
no
difficulty
in
that
,
"
rejoined
Ginger
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
be
constantly
on
the
look
-
out
.
<EOS>
You
're
sure
to
meet
him
some
time
or
other
'
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
true
,
"
replied
the
Sandman
;
"
and
there
's
no
fear
of
his
knowin
'
us
,
for
the
werry
moment
he
looked
round
<EOS>
I
knocked
him
on
the
head
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Arter
all
,
"
said
the
Tinker
,
"
there
's
<EOS>
no
branch
o
'
<EOS>
the
perfession
so
safe
as
yours
,
Ginger
.
<EOS>
The
law
is
favourable
to
you
,
and
the
beaks
is
afeerd
to
touch
you
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
shall
turn
dog
-
fancier
myself
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
good
business
,
"
replied
Ginger
,
"
but
it
requires
a
hedication
.
<EOS>
As
I
wos
sayin
'
,
we
gets
a
high
price
sometimes
for
restorin
'
a
favourite
,
especially
ven
ve've
a
soft
-
hearted
lady
to
deal
vith
.
<EOS>
There
's
some
vimen
as
fond
o
'
dogs
as
o
'
their
own
childer
,
and
ven
ve
gets
one
<EOS>
o
'
<EOS>
their
precious
pets
<EOS>
,
ve
makes
'em
ransom
it
as
the
brigands
you
see
at
the
Adelphi
or
the
Surrey
sarves
their
prisoners
,
threatenin
'
to
send
first
an
ear
,
and
then
a
paw
,
or
a
tail
,
and
so
on
.
<EOS>
I
'll
tell
you
wot
happened
t'other
day
.
<EOS>
There
wos
a
lady
--
a
Miss
Vite
--
as
was
desperate
fond
of
her
dog
.
<EOS>
It
wos
a
ugly
warmint
,
but
no
matter
for
that
--
the
creater
had
gained
her
heart
.
<EOS>
Vell
,
she
lost
it
;
and
,
somehow
or
other
,
I
found
it
.
<EOS>
She
vos
in
great
trouble
,
and
a
friend
o
'
mine
calls
to
say
she
can
have
the
dog
agin
,
but
she
must
pay
eight
pound
for
it
.
<EOS>
She
thinks
this
dear
,
and
a
friend
o
'
her
own
adwises
her
to
wait
,
sayin
'
better
terms
will
be
offered
;
so
I
sends
vord
by
my
friend
that
if
she
do
n't
come
down
at
once
the
poor
animal
's
throat
vill
be
cut
that
werry
night
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ha!--ha!--ha
!
"
laughed
the
others
.
 
<EOS>
"
Vell
,
she
sent
four
pound
,
and
I
put
up
with
it
,
"
pursued
Ginger
;
"
but
about
a
month
arterwards
<EOS>
she
loses
her
favourite
agin
,
and
,
strange
to
say
,
I
finds
it
.
<EOS>
The
same
game
is
played
over
again
,
and
she
comes
down
with
another
four
pound
.
<EOS>
But
she
takes
care
this
time
that
I
sha'n't
repeat
the
trick
;
for
no
sooner
does
she
obtain
persession
of
her
favourite
than
she
embarks
in
the
steamer
for
France
,
in
the
hope
of
keeping
her
dog
safe
there
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Oh

sang
the
Tinker

<EOS>
"
But
there
's
dog
-
fanciers
in
France
,
ai
n't
there
?
"
asked
the
Sandman
.
 
<EOS>
"
Lor
,
bless
'

,
yes

"
replied
Ginger
;
"
there
's
as
many
fanciers

France

here

<EOS>
Vy
,
ve
drives

<EOS>
There
's
scarcely
a

the

London

takes
out
a

They
goes
to
Ostend

Antverp
,
Rotterdam
,
Hamburg
,
and
sometimes
to
Havre

<EOS>
There
's
a
Mounseer
Coqquilu
as
comes
over
to
buy
dogs
,
and
ve
takes
'em
to
him
at
a
house
near
Billinsgit
market

<EOS>
"
Then
you
're
alvays
sure

<EOS>
a
ready
market
somehow

"
observed
the
Sandman
.
 
<EOS>
"
Sartin
,
"
replied
Ginger
,
"
cos
the
law
's
so
kind
to
us

<EOS>
Vy
,
bless
you

a
perliceman

n't
detain
us
,
even
if
he
knows

a
stolen

'd

<EOS>
Now
,
jist
to
show
you
the
difference
atwixt
<EOS>
the
two
perfessions:--I
steals
a

walue
,
maybe

fifty
pound
,
or
p'raps
more

<EOS>
Even
if
I
'm
catched
<EOS>
i
'
<EOS>
the
fact
I
may
get
fined
twenty

six

if
you
steals

you

abroad

dead
certainty

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
seems
hard
on
us

"
observed
the
Sandman
,
reflectively
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
the
law
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Ginger
,
triumphantly
.
<EOS>
"
Now
,
ve
generally
escapes
by

the
fine

our

and

<EOS>
Ve
alvays
stands
by

There

so

<EOS>
In

the
dog
is
delivered
up
to
us

<EOS>
"
The
law
seems
made
for
dog

fanciers

"
remarked
the
Tinker
.
 
<EOS>
"
Wot
d'ye
think
<EOS>
o
'
<EOS>
this
?
"
pursued
Ginger
.
<EOS>
"
I
'
wos
a
-
standin
'
at
the
corner
o

Gray

a

<EOS>
it
is
,
a
real
long-
eared
Charley

a
follerin

of

<EOS>
Vell
,
the
moment
I
spies
it
,
I
unties
my
apron
,
whips
up
the
dog
,
and
covers
it
up
in
a
trice
.
<EOS>
Vell
,
the
lady
sees
me
,
an
'
gives
me
in
charge
to
a
perliceman
.
<EOS>
But
that
si'nifies
nuffin

.
<EOS>
I
brings
six
vitnesses
to
svear
the
dog
vos
mine
,
and
I
actually
had
it
since
it
vos
a
blind
little
puppy
;
and
,
wot
's
more
,
I
brings
its
mother
,
and
that
settles
the
pint
.
<EOS>
So
in
course
I
'm
discharged
;
the
dog
is
given
up
to
me
;

the
lady
goes
avay
lamentin

<EOS>
I
then
plays
the
amiable
,
an
'
offers
to
sell
it
her
for
twenty
guineas
,
seein
'
as
how
she
had
taken
a

it

but
she
von't
bite

<EOS>
So
if
I
do

sell
it
next

I
shall
send
it
to
Mounseer

<EOS>
The
only
vay
you
can
go
wrong
is
to

the

<EOS>
"
Some
of
the
Fancy

given

cruelty

"
pursued
Ginger
,
"
and
crops
a
dog
's
ears
,
or
pulls
out
his
teeth
to
disguise
him
;
but
I
'm
too
fond

I

"
<EOS>
No

Ve

out

soon
after

Ay

Ginger

<EOS>
"
To

said
the

our

There

never

I

<EOS>
There

our

here

him

he
declares
he

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Walker

exclaimed
Ginger
,
putting
his
finger
to
his
nose
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
may
larf
,
but
it
's
true
,
"
replied
the
Tinker
.
<EOS>
"
I
recollect
an
old
man
tellin
'
me
that
he
knew
the
deputy
sixty
years
ago

and
he
looked
jist
the

"
 
<EOS>
"
Humph

Ginger
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He

so

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
the
cur'ousest
part
of

"
said
the
Tinker

<EOS>
"
He

THE
HAND
AND
THE
CLOAK
 
<EOS>
A
furious
barking
from
Mr.
Ginger
's
dogs
,
shortly
after
the
departure
of
the
drowsy
youth
,
announced
the
approach
of
a
grotesque
-
looking
little
personage
,
whose
shoulders
barely
reached
to
a
level
with
the
top
of
the
table
.
<EOS>
This
was
Old
Parr
.
<EOS>
The
dwarf
's
head
was
much
too
large
for
his
body
,
as
is
mostly
the
case
with
undersized
persons
,
and
was
covered
with
a
forest
of
rusty
black
hair
,
protected
by
a
strangely
shaped
seal
-
skin
cap
.
<EOS>
His
hands
and
feet
were
equally
disproportioned
to
his
frame
,
and
his
arms
were
so
long
that
he
could
touch
his
ankles
while
standing
upright
.
<EOS>
His
spine
was
crookened
,
and
his
head
appeared
buried
in
his
breast
.
<EOS>
The
general
character
of
his
face
seemed
to
appertain
to
the
middle
period
of
life
;
but
a
closer
inspection
enabled
the
beholder
to
detect
in
it
marks
of
extreme
old
age
.
<EOS>
The
nose
was
broad
and
flat
,
like
that
of
an
orang
-
outang
;
the
resemblance
to
which
animal
was
heightened
by
a
very
long
upper
lip
,
projecting
jaws
,
almost
total
absence
of
chin
,
and
a
retreating
forehead
.
<EOS>
The
little
old
man
's
complexion
was
dull
and
swarthy
,
but
his
eyes
were
keen
and
sparkling
.
 
<EOS>
His
attire
was
as
singular
as
his
person
.
<EOS>
Having
recently
served
as
double
to
a
famous
demon
-
dwarf
at
the
Surrey
Theatre
,
he
had
become
possessed
of
a
cast
-
off
pair
of
tawny
tights
,
an
elastic
shirt
of
the
same
material
and
complexion
,
to
the
arms
of
which
little
green
bat-
<EOS>
like
wings
were
attached
,
while
a
blood
-
red
tunic
with
vandyke
points
was
girded
round
his
waist
.
<EOS>
In
this
strange
apparel
his
diminutive
limbs
were
encased
,
while
additional
warmth
was
afforded
by
the
great-
coat
already
mentioned
,
the
tails
of
which
swept
the
floor
after
him
like
a
train
.
 
<EOS>
Having
silenced
his
dogs
with
some
difficulty
,
Mr.
Ginger
burst
into
a
roar
of
laughter
,
excited
by
the
little
old
man
's
grotesque
appearance
,
in
which
he
was
joined
by
the
Tinker
;
but
the
Sandman
never
relaxed
a
muscle
of
his
sullen
countenance
.
 
<EOS>
Their
hilarity
,
however
,
was
suddenly
checked
by
an
inquiry
from
the
dwarf
,
in
a
shrill
,
odd
tone
,
'
whether
they
had
sent
for
him
only
to
laugh
at
him
?
'
 
<EOS>
"
Sartainly
not
,
deputy
,
"
replied
the
Tinker
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Here
,
lazy
-
bones
,
glasses
o
'
rum
-
an'-vater
,
all
round
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
drowsy
youth
bestirred
himself
to
execute
the
command
.
<EOS>
The
spirit
was
brought
;
water
was
procured
from
the
boiling
copper
;
and
the
Tinker
handed
his
guest
a
smoking
rummer
,
accompanied
with
a
polite
request
to
make
himself
comfortable
.
 
<EOS>
Opposite
the
table
at
which
the
party
were
seated
,
it
has
been
said
,
was
a
staircase
old
and
crazy
,
and
but
imperfectly
protected
by
a
broken
hand
-
rail
.
<EOS>
Midway
up
it
stood
a
door
equally
dilapidated
,
but
secured
by
a
chain
and
lock
,
of
which
Old
Parr
,
as
deputy
-
chamberlain
,
kept
the
key
.
<EOS>
Beyond
this
point
,
the
staircase
branched
off
on
the
right
,
and
a
row
of
stout
wooden
banisters
,
ranged
like
the
feet
of
so
many
cattle
,
was
visible
from
beneath
.
<EOS>
Ultimately
,
the
staircase
reached
a
small
gallery
,
if
such
a
name
can
be
applied
to
a
narrow
passage
,
communicating
with
the
bedrooms
,
the
doors
of
which
,
as
a
matter
of
needful
precaution
,
were
locked
outside
;
and
as
the
windows
were
grated
,
no
one
could
leave
his
chamber
without
the
knowledge
of
the
landlord
or
his
representative
.
<EOS>
No
lights
were
allowed
in
the
bedrooms
,
nor
in
the
passage
adjoining
them
.
 
<EOS>
Conciliated
by
the
Tinker
's
offering
,
Old
Parr
mounted
the
staircase
,
and
planting
himself
near
the
door
,
took
off
his
great
-
coat
,
and
sat
down
upon
it
.
<EOS>
His
impish
garb
being
thus
more
fully
displayed
,
he
looked
so
unearthly
and
extraordinary
that
the
dogs
began
to
howl
fearfully
,
and
Ginger
had
enough
to
do
to
quiet
them
.
 
<EOS>
Silence
being
at
length
restored
,
the
Tinker
,
winking
slyly
at
his
companions
,
opened
the
conversation
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
deputy
,
"
he
observed
,
"
<EOS>
ve've
bin
havin'
<EOS>
a
bit
o
'
<EOS>
a
dispute
vich
you
can
settle
for
us
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
let
's
see
,
"
squeaked
the
dwarf
.
<EOS>
"
What
is
it
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Vy
,
it
's
relative
to
your
age
,
"
rejoined
the
Tinker
.
<EOS>
"
Ven
wos
you
born
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
so
long
ago
,
I
ca
n't
recollect
,
"
returned
Old
Parr
,
rather
sulkily
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
must
ha
'
seen
some
changes
in
your
time
?
"
resumed
the
Tinker
,
waiting
till
the
little
old
man
had
made
some
progress
with
his
grog
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
rayther
think
I
have
--
a
few
,
"
replied
Old
Parr
,
whose
tongue
the
generous
liquid
had
loosened
.
<EOS>
"
I
've
seen
this
great
city
of
London
pulled
down
,
and
built
up
again
--
if
that
's
anything
.
<EOS>
I
've
seen
it
grow
,
and
grow
,
till
it
has
reached
its
present
size
.
<EOS>
You
'll
scarcely
believe
me
,
when
I
tell
you
,
that
I
recollect
this
Rookery
of
ours--
<EOS>
this
foul
vagabond
neighbourhood
--
an
open
country
field
,
with
hedges
round
it
,
and
trees
.
<EOS>
And
a
lovely
spot
it
was
.
<EOS>
Broad
Saint
Giles
's
,
at
the
time
I
speak
of
,
was
a
little
country
village
,
consisting
of
a
few
straggling
houses
standing
by
the
roadside
,
and
there
was
n't
a
single
habitation
between
it
and
Convent
-
garden
(
for
so
<EOS>
the
present
market
was
once
called
)
;
while
that
garden
,
which
was
fenced
round
with
pales
,
like
a
park
,
extended
from
Saint
Martin's
-
lane
to
Drury
-
house
,
a
great
mansion
situated
on
the
easterly
side
of
Drury
-
lane
,
amid
a
grove
of
beautiful
timber
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
My
eyes
!
"
cried
Ginger
,
with
a
prolonged
whistle
;
"
the
place
must
be
preciously
transmogrified
indeed
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
If
I
were
to
describe
the
changes
that
have
taken
place
in
London
since
I
've
known
It
,
I
might
go
on
talking
for
a
month
,
"
pursued
Old
Parr
.
<EOS>
"
The
whole
aspect
of
the
place
is
altered
.
<EOS>
The
Thames
itself
is
unlike
the
Thames
of
old
.
<EOS>
Its
waters
were
once
as
clear
and
bright
above
London
-
bridge
as
they
are
now
at
Kew
or
Richmond
;
and
its
banks
,
from
Whitefriars
to
Scotland
-
yard
,
were
edged
with
gardens
.
<EOS>
And
then
the
thousand
gay
wherries
and
gilded
barges
that
covered
its
bosom--
all
are
gone
--
all
are
gone
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Those
must
ha
'
been
nice
times
for
the
jolly
young
vatermen
vich
at
Blackfriars
wos
used
for
to
ply
,
"
chanted
the
Tinker
;
"
but
the
steamers
has
put
their
noses
out
o
'
joint
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
True
,
"
replied
Old
Parr
;
"
and
I
,
for
one
,
am
sorry
for
it
.
<EOS>
Remembering
,
as
I
do
,
what
the
river
used
to
be
when
enlightened
by
gay
craft
and
merry
company
,
I
ca
n't
help
wishing
its
waters
less
muddy
,
and
those
ugly
coal
-
barges
,
lighters
,
and
steamers
,
away
.
<EOS>
London
is
a
mighty
city
,
wonderful
to
behold
and
examine
,
inexhaustible
in
its
wealth
and
power
;
but
in
point
of
beauty
,
it
is
not
to
be
compared
with
the
city
of
Queen
Bess
's
days
.
<EOS>
You
should
have
seen
the
Strand
then
--
a
line
of
noblemen
's
houses
--
and
as
to
Lombard-
street
and
Gracechurch
-
street
,
with
their
wealthy
goldsmith
's
shops--
<EOS>
but
I
do
n't
like
to
think
of
'
em
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yell
,
I
'm
content
vith
Lunnun
as
it
is
,
"
replied
the
Tinker
,
"
'
specially
as
there
ai
n't
much
chance
<EOS>
o
'
the
ould
city
bein
'
rewived

"
 
<EOS>
"
Not
much
,
"
replied
the
dwarf
,
finishing
his
glass
,
which
was
replenished
at
a
sign
from
the
Tinker
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
s'pose
,
my
wenerable
,
you
've
seen
the
king
as
bequeathed
his
name
to
these
pretty
creaters

said
Ginger
,
raising
his
coat
--
pockets
,
so
as
to
exhibit
the
heads
of
the
two
little
black
-
and
-
tan
spaniels
.
 
<EOS>
"
What

cried
the
dwarf--"often

<EOS>
I
was
page
to
his
favourite
mistress
,
the
Duchess
of
Cleveland
,
and
I
have
seen
him
a
hundred
times

a
pack
of
dogs
of
that
description
at
his
heels

"
said
Ginger
,
rising
and
lighting
a
pipe
at
the
fire
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
loved
the
femi
-
nine
specious
as
well
as
the
ca
-
nine
specious
.
<EOS>
Can
you
tell
us
anythin
'
more
about
him
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Not
now
,
"
replied
Old
Parr
.
<EOS>
"
I
've
seen
so
much
,
and
heard
so
much
,
that
my
brain
is
quite
addled
.
<EOS>
My
memory
sometimes
deserts
me
altogether
,
and
my
past
life
appears
like
a
dream
.
<EOS>
Imagine
what
my
feelings
must
be
,
to
walk
through
streets
,
still
called
by
the
old
names
,
but
in
other
respects
wholly
changed
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
if
you
could
but
have
a
glimpse
of
Old
London
,
you
would
not
be
able
to
endure
the
modern
city
.
<EOS>
The
very
atmosphere
was
different
from
that
which
we
now
breathe
,
charged
with
the
smoke
of
myriads
of
sea
-
coal
fires
;
and
the
old
picturesque
houses
had
a
charm
about
them
,
which
the
present
habitations
,
however
commodious
,
altogether
want
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
talk
like
one
o
'
<EOS>
them
smart
chaps
<EOS>
they
calls
,
and
werry
properly
,
penny
-
a
-
liars
,
"
observed
Ginger
.
<EOS>
"
But
you
make
me
long
to
ha
'
lived
<EOS>
i
'
those
times
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
If
you
had
lived
in
them
,
you
would
have
belonged
to
Paris
-
garden
,
or
the
bull
-
baiting
and
bear
-
baiting
houses
in
Southwark
,
"
replied
Old
Parr
.
<EOS>
"
I
've
seen
fellows
just
like
you
at
each
of
those
places
.
<EOS>
Strange
,
though
times
and
fashions
change
,
men
continue
the
same
.
<EOS>
I
often
meet
a
face
that
I
can
remember
in
James
the
First
's
time
.
<EOS>
But
the
old
places
are
gone
--
clean
gone
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Accordin
'
to
your
own
showin
'
,
my
wenerable
friend
<EOS>
,
you
must
ha
'
lived
<EOS>
uppards
o
'
two
hundred
and
seventy
year
,
"
said
Ginger
,
assuming
a
consequential
manner
.
<EOS>
"
Now
,
doorin
'
all
that
time
,
have
you
never
felt
inclined
to
'
kick
the
bucket
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Not
the
least
,
"
replied
Old
Parr
.
<EOS>
"
My
bodily
health
has
been
excellent
.
<EOS>
But
,
as
I
have
just
said
,
my
intellects
are
a
little
impaired
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Not
a
little
,
I
should
think
,
"
replied
Ginger
,
hemming
significantly
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
vether
<EOS>
you
're
a
deceivin
'
of
us
or
yourself
,
my
wenerable
;
but
von
thing
's
quite
clear
--
you
ca
n't
have
lived
all
that
time
.
<EOS>
It
's
not
in
nater
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Very
well
,
then
--
I
have
n't
,
"
said
Old
Parr
.
 
<EOS>
And
he
finished
his
rum
-
and
-
water
,
and
set
down
the
glass
,
which
was
instantly
filled
again
by
the
drowsy
youth
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
've
seen
some
picters
o
'
Old
Lunnum
,
and
they
've
haanted
you
in
your
dreams
,
till
you
've
begun
to
fancy
<EOS>
you
lived
in
those
times
,
"
said
Ginger
.
 
<EOS>
"
Very
likely
,
"
replied
Old
Parr--"very
likely
.
"
 
<EOS>
There
was
something
,
however
,
in
his
manner
calculated
to
pique
the
dog
-
fancier
's
curiosity
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
comes
it
,
"
he
said
,
stretching
out
his
legs
,
and
arranging
his
neckcloth,--"how
comes
it
,
if
you
've
lived
so
long
,
that
you
ai
n't
higher
up
in
the
stirrups
--
better
off
,
as
folks
say
?
"
 
<EOS>
The
dwarf
made
no
reply
,
but
covering
his
face
with
his
hands
,
seemed
a
prey
to
deep
emotion
.
<EOS>
After
a
few
moments
'
pause
,
Ginger
repeated
the
question
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
you
wo
n't
believe
what
I
tell
you
,
it
's
useless
to
give
an
answer
,
"
said
Old
Parr
,
somewhat
gruffly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
yes
,
I
believe
you
,
deputy
,
"
observed
the
Tinker
,
"
and
so
does
the
Sandman
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
then
,
"
replied
the
dwarf
,
"
I
'll
tell
you
how
it
comes
to
pass
.
<EOS>
Fate
has
been
against
me
.
<EOS>
I
've
had
plenty
of
chances
,
but
I
never
could
get
on
.
<EOS>
I
've
been
in
a
hundred
different
walks
of
life
,
but
they
always
led
down
hill
.
<EOS>
It
's
my
destiny
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
hard
,
"
rejoined
the
Tinker--"werry
hard
.
<EOS>
But
how
d'ye
account
for
livin
'
so
long
?
"
he
added
,
winking
as
he
spoke
to
the
others
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
've
already
given
you
an
explanation
,
"
replied
the
dwarf
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
but
it
's
a
cur
-
ous
story
,
and
I
vants
my
friends
to
hear
it
,
"
said
the
Tinker
,
in
a
coaxing
tone
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
then
,
to
oblige
you
,
I
'll
go
through
it
again
,
"
rejoined
the
dwarf
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
know
I
was
for
some
time
servant
to
Doctor
Lamb
,
an
old
alchemist
,
who
lived
during
the
reign
of
good
Queen
Bess
,
and
who
used
to
pass
all
his
time
in
trying
to
find
out
the
secret
of
changing
lead
and
copper
into
gold
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
've
known
several
indiwiduals
as
has
found
out
that
secret
,
wenerable
,
"
observed
Ginger
.
"
<EOS>
And
ve
calls
'em
smashers
,
now
-
a
-
days
not
halchemists
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Doctor
Lamb
's
object
was
actually
to
turn
base
metal
into
gold
,
"
rejoined
Old
Parr
,
in
a
tone
of
slight
contempt
.
"
<EOS>
But
his
chief
aim
was
to
produce
the
Elixir
of
Long
Life
.
<EOS>
Night
and
day
he
worked
at
the
operation;--night
and
day
<EOS>
I
laboured
with
him
,
until
at
last
we
were
both
brought
to
the
verge
of
the
grave
in
our
search
after
immortality
.
<EOS>
One
night
--
I
remember
it
<EOS>
well,--it
was
the
last
night
of
the
sixteenth
century,--a
young
man
,
severely
wounded
,
was
brought
to
my
master
's
dwelling
on
London
-
bridge
.
<EOS>
I
helped
to
convey
him
to
the
laboratory
,
where
I
left
him
with
the
doctor
,
who
was
busy
with
his
experiments
.
<EOS>
My
curiosity
being
aroused
,
I
listened
at
the
door
,
and
though
I
could
not
distinguish
much
that
passed
inside
,
I
heard
sufficient
to
convince
me
that
Doctor
Lamb
had
made
the
grand
discovery
,
and
succeeded
in
distilling
the
elixir
.
<EOS>
Having
learnt
this
,
I
went
down
stairs
,
wondering
what
would
next
ensue
.
<EOS>
Half
an
hour
elapsed
,
and
while
the
bells
were
ringing
in
the
new
year
joyfully
,
the
young
man
whom
I
had
assisted
to
carry
upstairs
,
and
whom
I
supposed
at
death
's
door
,
marched
down
as
firmly
as
if
nothing
had
happened
,
passed
by
me
,
and
disappeared
,
before
I
could
shake
off
my
astonishment
.
<EOS>
I
saw
at
once
he
had
drunk
the
elixir
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ah!--ah
!
"
exclaimed
the
Tinker
,
with
a
knowing
glance
at
his
companions
,
who
returned
it
with
gestures
of
equal
significance
.
 
<EOS>
"
As
soon
as
he
was
gone
,
"
pursued
the
dwarf
,
"
<EOS>
I
flew
to
the
laboratory
,
and
there
,
extended
on
the
floor
,
I
found
the
dead
body
of
Dr.
Lamb
.
<EOS>
I
debated
with
myself
what
to
do
--
whether
to
pursue
his
murderer
,
for
such
I
accounted
the
young
man
;
but
,
on
reflection
,
I
thought
the
course
useless
.
<EOS>
I
next
looked
round
to
see
whether
the
precious
elixir
was
gone
.
<EOS>
On
the
table
stood
a
phial
,
from
which
a
strong
spirituous
odour
exhaled
;
but
it
was
empty
.
<EOS>
I
then
turned
my
attention
to
a
receiver
,
connected
by
a
worm
with
an
alembic
on
the
furnace
.
<EOS>
On
examining
it
,
I
found
it
contained
a
small
quantity
of
a
bright
transparent
liquid
,
which
,
poured
forth
into
a
glass
,
emitted
precisely
the
same
odour
as
the
phial
.
<EOS>
Persuaded
this
must
be
the
draught
of
immortality
,
I
raised
it
to
my
lips
;
but
apprehension
lest
it
might
be
poison
stayed
my
hand
.
<EOS>
Reassured
,
however
,
by
the
thought
of
the
young
man
's
miraculous
recovery
,
I
quaffed
the
potion
.
<EOS>
It
was
as
if
I
had
swallowed
fire
,
and
at
first
I
thought
all
was
over
with
me
.
<EOS>
I
shrieked
out
;
but
there
was
no
one
to
heed
my
cries
,
unless
it
were
my
dead
master
,
and
two
or
three
skeletons
with
which
the
walls
were
garnished
.
<EOS>
And
these
,
in
truth
,
did
seem
to
hear
me
;
for
the
dead
corpse
opened
its
glassy
orbs
,
and
eyed
me
reproachfully
;
the
skeletons
shook
their
fleshless
arms
and
gibbered
;
and
the
various
strange
objects
with
which
the
chamber
was
filled
,
seemed
to
deride
and
menace
me
.
<EOS>
The
terror
occasioned
by
these
fantasies
,
combined
with
the
potency
of
the
draught
,
took
away
my
senses
.
<EOS>
When
I
recovered
,
I
found
all
tranquil
.
<EOS>
Doctor
Lamb
was
lying
stark
and
stiff
at
my
feet
,
with
an
expression
of
reproach
on
his
fixed
countenance
;
and
the
skeletons
were
hanging
quietly
in
their
places
.
<EOS>
Convinced
that
I
was
proof
against
death
,
I
went
forth
.
<EOS>
But
a
curse
went
with
me
!
<EOS>
From
that
day
to
this
,
I
have
lived
,
but
it
has
been
in
such
poverty
and
distress
,
that
I
had
better
far
have
died
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
I
am
constantly
haunted
by
visions
of
my
old
master
.
<EOS>
He
seems
to
hold
converse
with
me
--
to
lead
me
into
strange
places
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Exactly
the
case
with
the
t'other
,
"
whispered
the
Tinker
to
the
Sandman
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Have
you
ever
,
in
the
coorse
<EOS>
o
'
<EOS>
your
long
life
,
met
the
young
man
as
drank
the
'
lixir
?
<EOS>
"
he
inquired
of
the
dwarf
.
 
<EOS>
"
Never
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Do
you
happen
to
rekilect
his
name
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
;
it
has
quite
escaped
my
memory
,
"
answered
Old
Parr
.
 
<EOS>
"
Should
you
rekilect
it
,
if
you
heerd
it
?
"
asked
the
Tinker
.
 
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
I
might
,
"
returned
the
dwarf
;
"
but
I
ca
n't
say
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Wos
it
Auriol
Darcy
?
"
demanded
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
was
the
name
,
"
cried
Old
Parr
,
starting
up
in
extreme
surprise
.
<EOS>
"
I
heard
Doctor
Lamb
call
him
so
.
<EOS>
But
how
,
in
the
name
of
wonder
,
do
you
come
to
know
it
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ve've
got
summat
,
at
last
,
"
said
the
Tinker
,
with
a
self
-
applauding
glance
at
his
friends
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
come
to
know
it
,
I
say
?
<EOS>
"
repeated
the
dwarf
,
in
extreme
agitation
.
 
<EOS>
"
Never
mind
,
"
rejoined
the
Tinker
,
with
a
cunning
look
;
"
you
see
I
does
know
some
cur'ous
matters
as
vell
as
you
,
my
old
file
.
<EOS>
You
'll
be
good
evidence
,
in
case

vishes

fact
agin

<EOS>
"
Prove
what?--and
against
whom
?
"
cried
the
 
"
One
more
questin
,
and
I
've
done
,
"
pursued
the
Tinker
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Should
you
know
this
young
man
again
,
in
case
you
chanced
to
come
across
him
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
doubt
of
it
,
"
replied
Old
Parr
;
"
his
figure
often
flits
before
me
in
dreams
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Shall
ve
let
him
into
it
?
"
said
the
Tinker
,
consulting
his
companions
in
a
low
tone
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
--
ay
,
"
replied
the
Sandman
.
 
<EOS>
"
Better
vait
a
bit
,
"
remarked
Ginger
,
shaking
his
head
dubiously
.
<EOS>
"
There
's
no
hurry
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
;
ve
must
decide
at
vonce
,
"
said
the
Tinker
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Jist
examine
them
papers
,
"
he
added
,
handing
the
pocket
-
book
to
Old
Parr
,
"
and
favour
us
vith
your
opinion

"
 
<EOS>
The
dwarf
was
about
to
unclasp
the
book
committed
to
his
charge
,
when
a
hand
was
suddenly
thrust
through
the
banisters
of
the
upper
part
of
the
staircase
,
which
,
as
has
been
already
stated
,
was
divided
from
the
lower
by
the
door
.
<EOS>
A
piece
of
heavy
black
drapery
next
descended
like
a
cloud
,
concealing
all
behind
it
except
the
hand
,
with
which
the
dwarf
was
suddenly
seized
by
the
nape
of
the
neck
,
lifted
up
in
the
air
,
and
,
notwithstanding
his
shrieks
and
struggles
,
carried
clean
off
.
 
<EOS>
Great
confusion
attended
his
disappearance
.
<EOS>
The
dogs
set
up
a
prodigious
barking
,
and
flew
to
the
rescue
--
one
of
the
largest
of
them
passing
over
the
body
of
the
drowsy
waiter
,
who
had
sought
his
customary
couch
upon
the
coals
,
and
rousing
him
from
his
slumbers
;
while
the
Tinker
,
uttering
a
fierce
imprecation
,
upset
his
chair
in
his
haste
to
catch
hold
of
the
dwarf
's
legs
;
but
the
latter
was
already
out
of
reach
,
and
the
next
moment
had
vanished
entirely
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
eyes
!
<EOS>
here
's
a
pretty
go
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Ginger
,
who
,
with
his
back
to
the
fire
,
had
witnessed
the
occurrence
in
open
-
mouthed
astonishment
,
"
Vy
,
curse
it
!
<EOS>
if
the
wenerable
ai
n't

taken
the
pocket

book

<EOS>
It
's
my
opinion
<EOS>
the
devil
has
flown
avay
with
the
old
feller
.
<EOS>
His
time
wos
nearer
at

and
than

expected

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Devil

I
'll
have
him
back

the
pocket-
book
!
"
cried
the
Tinker
.
<EOS>
And
,
dashing
up
the
stairs
,
he
caught
hold
of
the
railing
above
,
and
swinging
himself
up
by
a
powerful
effort
,
passed
through
an
opening
,
<EOS>
occasioned
by
the
removal
of
one
of
the
banisters
.
 
<EOS>
Groping
along
the
gallery
,
which
was
buried
in
profound
darkness
,
he
shouted
to
the
dwarf
,
but
received
no
answer
to
his
vociferations
;
neither
could
he
discover
any
one
,
though
he
felt
on
either
side
of
the
passage
with
outstretched
hands
.
<EOS>
The
occupants
of
the
different
chambers
,
alarmed
by
the
noise
,
called
out
to
know
what
was
going
forward
;
but
being
locked
in
their
rooms
,
they
could
render
no
assistance
.
 
<EOS>
While
the
Tinker
was
thus
pursuing
his
search
in
the
dark
,
venting
his
rage
and
disappointment
in
the
most
dreadful
imprecations
,
the
staircase
door
was
opened
by
the
landlord
,
who
had
found
the
key
in
the
great
-
coat
left
behind
by
the
dwarf
.
<EOS>
With
the
landlord
came
the
Sandman
and
Ginger
,
the
latter
of
whom
was
attended
by
all
his
dogs
,
still
barking
furiously
;
while
the
rear
of
the
party
was
brought
up
by
the
drowsy
waiter
,
now
wide
awake
with
fright
,
and
carrying
a
candle
.
 
<EOS>
But
though
every
nook
and
corner
of
the
place
was
visited
--
though
the
attics
were
searched
and
all
the
windows
examined
--
not
a
trace
of
the
dwarf
could
be
discovered
,
nor
any
clue
to
his
mysterious
disappearance
detected
.
<EOS>
Astonishment
and
alarm
sat
on
every
countenance
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
the
devil
can
have
become
of
him
?
"
cried
the
landlord
,
with
a
look
of
dismay
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
that
's
the
questin
!
<EOS>
"
rejoined
the
Tinker
.
<EOS>
"
I
begin
to
be
of
Ginger
's
opinion
,
that
the
devil
himself
must
have
flown
avay
vith
him
.
<EOS>
No
von
else
could
ha
'
taken
a
fancy
to
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
only
saw
a
hand
and
a
black
cloak
,
"
said
the
Sandman
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
thought
I
seed
a
pair
o
'
hoofs
,
"
cried
the
waiter
;
"
and
I
'm
quite
sure
I
seed
a
pair
o
'
great
glitterin
'
eyes
,
"
he
added
,
opening
his
own
lacklustre
orbs
to
their
widest
extent
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
strange
affair
,
"
observed
the
landlord
,
gravely
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
certain
that
no
one
has
entered
the
house
wearing
a
cloak
such
as
you
describe
;
nor
could
any
of
the
lodgers
,
to
my
knowledge
,
get
out
of
their
rooms
.
<EOS>
It
was
Old
Parr
's
business
,
as
you
know
,
to
lock
'em
up
carefully
for
the
night
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Veil
,
all
's
over
vith
him
now
,
"
said
the
Tinker
;
"
and
vith
our
affair
,
too
<EOS>
,
I
'm
afeerd
.
<EOS>
"
 
"
Do
n't
say
die
jist
yet
,
"
rejoined
Ginger
.
<EOS>
"
The
wenerable
's
gone
,
to
be
sure
;
and
the
only
thing
he
has
left
behind
him
,
barrin
'
his
top-
coat
,
is
this

<EOS>
bit

There

Concurring
in

they
all
descended

THE
IRON
-
MERCHANT
'S
DAUGHTER
 
<EOS>
A
WEEK
had
elapsed
since
Auriol
Darcy
was
conveyed
to
the
iron-
merchant
's
dwelling
,
after
the
attack
made
upon
him
by
the
ruffians
in
the
ruined
house
;
and
though
almost
recovered
from
the
serious
injuries
he
had
received
,
he
still
remained
the
guest
of
his
preserver
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
bright
spring
morning
,
when
a
door
leading
to
the
yard
in
front
of
the
house
opened
,
and
a
young
girl
,
bright
and
fresh
as
the
morning
's
self
,
issued
from
it
.
 
<EOS>
A
lovelier
creature
than
Ebba
Thorneycroft
can
not
be
imagined
.
<EOS>
Her
figure
was
perfection
slight
,
tall
,
and
ravishingly
proportioned
,
with
a
slender
waist
,
little
limbs
,
and
fairy
feet
that
would
have
made
the
fortune
of
an
opera
-
dancer
.
<EOS>
Her
features
were
almost
angelic
in
expression
,
with
an
outline
of
the
utmost
delicacy
and
precision
not
cold
,
classical
regularity
but
that
softer
and
incomparably
more
lovely
mould
peculiar
to
our
own
clime
.
<EOS>
Ebba
's
countenance
was
a
type
of
Saxon
beauty
.
<EOS>
Her
complexion
was
pure
white
,
tinged
with
a
slight
bloom
.
<EOS>
Her
eyes
were
of
a
serene
summer
blue
,
arched
over
by
brows
some
shades
darker
than
the
radiant
tresses
that
fell
on
either
cheek
,
and
were
parted
over
a
brow
smoother
than
alabaster
.
<EOS>
Her
attire
was
simple
,
but
tasteful
,
and
by
its
dark
colour
threw
into
relief
the
exceeding
fairness
of
her
skin
.
 
<EOS>
Ebba
's
first
care
was
to
feed
her
favourite
linnet
,
placed
in
a
cage
over
the
door
.
<EOS>
Having
next
patted
the
head
of
a
huge
bulldog
who
came
out
of
his
kennel
to
greet
her
,
and
exchanged
a
few
words
with
two
men
employed
at
a
forge
in
the
inner
part
of
the
building
on
the
right
,
she
advanced
farther
into
the
yard
.
 
<EOS>
This
part
of
the
premises
,
being
strewn
with
ironwork
of
every
possible
shape
,
presented
a
very
singular
appearance
,
and
may
merit
some
description
.
<EOS>
There
were
heaps
of
rusty
iron
chains
flung
together
like
fishermen
's
nets
,
old
iron
area
-
guards
,
iron
kitchen
-
fenders
,
old
grates
,
safes
,
piles
of
old
iron
bowls
,
a
large
assortment
of
old
iron
pans
and
dishes
,
a
ditto
of
old
ovens
,
kettles
without
number
,
sledge-
hammers
,
anvils
,
braziers
,
chimney
-
cowls
,
and
smokejacks
.
 
<EOS>
Stout
upright
posts
,
supporting
cross
-
beams
on
the
top
,
were
placed
at
intervals
on
either
side
of
the
yard
,
and
these
were
decorated
,
in
the
most
artistic
style
,
with
rat
-
traps
,
man
-
traps
,
iron
lanterns
,
pulleys
,
padlocks
,
chains
,
trivets
,
triangles
,
iron
rods
,
disused
street
lamps
,
dismounted
cannon
and
anchors
.
<EOS>
Attached
to
hooks
in
the
cross
-
beam
nearest
the
house
hung
a
row
of
old
horseshoes
,
while
from
the
centre
depended
a
large
rusty
bell
.
<EOS>
Near
the
dog
's
kennel
was
a
tool
-
box
,
likewise
garnished
with
horse
-
shoes
,
and
containing
pincers
,
files
,
hammers
,
and
other
implements
proper
to
the
smith
.
<EOS>
Beyond
this
was
an
open
doorway
leading
to
the
workshop
,
where
the
two
men
before
mentioned
were
busy
at
the
forge
.
 
<EOS>
Though
it
was
still
early
,
the
road
was
astir
with
passengers
,
and
many
wagons
and
carts
,
laden
with
hay
,
straw
,
and
vegetables
,
were
passing
.
<EOS>
Ebba
,
however
,
had
been
solely
drawn
forth
by
the
beauty
of
the
morning
,
and
she
stopped
for
a
moment
at
the
street
gate
,
to
breathe
the
barmy
air
.
<EOS>
As
she
inhaled
the
gentle
breeze
,
and
felt
the
warm
sunshine
upon
her
cheek
,
her
thoughts
wandered
away
into
the
green
meadows
in
which
she
had
strayed
as
a
child
,
and
she
longed
to
ramble
amid
them
again
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
she
scarcely
desired
a
solitary
stroll
;
but
however
this
might
be
,
she
was
too
much
engrossed
by
the
reverie
to
notice
a
tall
man
,
wrapped
in
a
long
black
cloak
,
who
regarded
her
with
the
most
fixed
attention
,
as
he
passed
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
road
.
 
<EOS>
Proceeding
to
a
short
distance
,
this
personage
crossed
over
,
and
returned
slowly
towards
the
iron
-
merchant
's
dwelling
.
<EOS>
Ebba
then
,
for
the
first
time
,
remarked
him
,
and
was
startled
by
his
strange
,
sinister
appearance
.
<EOS>
His
features
were
handsome
,
but
so
malignant
and
fierce
in
expression
,
that
they
inspired
only
aversion
.
<EOS>
A
sardonic
grin
curled
his
thin
lips
,
and
his
short
,
crisply
curled
hair
,
raven
black
in
hue
,
contrasted
forcibly
and
disagreeably
with
his
cadaverous
complexion
.
<EOS>
An
attraction
like
that
of
the
snake
seemed
to
reside
in
his
dark
blazing
eyes
,
for
Ebba
trembled
like
a
bird
beneath
their
influence
,
and
could
not
remove
her
gaze
from
them
.
<EOS>
A
vague
presentiment
of
coming
ill
smote
her
,
and
she
dreaded
lest
the
mysterious
being
before
her
might
be
connected
in
some
inexplicable
way
with
her
future
destiny
.
 
<EOS>
On
his
part
,
the
stranger
was
not
insensible
to
the
impression
he
had
produced
,
and
suddenly
halting
,
he
kept
his
eyes
riveted
on
those
of
the
girl
,
who
,
after
remaining
spell
-
bound
,
as
it
were
,
for
a
few
moments
,
precipitately
retreated
towards
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
Just
as
she
reached
the
door
,
and
was
about
to
pass
through
it
,
Auriol
came
forth
.
<EOS>
He
was
pale
,
as
if
from
recent
suffering
,
and
bore
his
left
arm
in
a
sling
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
look
agitated
,
"
he
said
,
<EOS>
noticing
Ebba
's
uneasiness
.
<EOS>
"
What
has
happened
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Not
much
,
"
she
replied
,
a
deep
blush
mantling
her
cheeks
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
have
been
somewhat
alarmed
by
the
person
near
the
gate
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Indeed
!
"
cried
Auriol
,
darting
forward
.
<EOS>
"
Where
is
he
?
<EOS>
I
see
no
one
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Not
a
tall
man
,
wrapped
in
a
long
black
cloak
?
"
rejoined
Ebba
,
following
him
cautiously
.
"
<EOS>
Ha
!
"
cried
Auriol
.
<EOS>
"
Has
he
been
here
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
you
know
the
person
I
allude
to
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
rejoined
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
some
one
answering
his
description
,
"
he
replied
,
with
a
forced
smile
.
 
<EOS>
"
Once
beheld
,
the
man
I
mean
is
not
to
be
forgotten
,
"
said
Ebba
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
has
a
countenance
such
as
I
never
saw
before
.
<EOS>
If
I
could
believe
in
the
'
evil
eye
'
,
I
should
be
sure
he
possessed
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
'
Tis
he
,
there
can
be
no
doubt
,
"
rejoined
Auriol
,
in
a
sombre
tone
.
 
<EOS>
"
Who
and
what
is
he
,
then
?
"
demanded
Ebba
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
is
a
messenger
of
ill
,
"
replied
Auriol
,
"
and
I
am
thankful
he
is
gone
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Are
you
quite
sure
of
it
?
"
<EOS>
she
asked
,
glancing
timorously
up
and
down
the
road
.
<EOS>
But
the
mysterious
individual
could
no
longer
be
seen
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
so
,
after
exciting
my
curiosity
in
this
manner
,
you
will
not
satisfy
it
?
<EOS>
"
she
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
,
"
rejoined
Auriol
,
somewhat
sternly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
then
,
since
you
are
so
ungracious
,
I
shall
go
and
prepare
breakfast
,
"
she
replied
.
<EOS>
"
My
father
must
be
down
by
this
time
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Stay
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Auriol
,
arresting
her
,
as
she
was
about
to
pass
through
the
door
.
<EOS>
"
I
wish
to
have
a
word
with
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
Ebba
stopped
,
and
the
bloom
suddenly
forsook
her
cheeks
.
 
<EOS>
But
Auriol
seemed
unable
to
proceed
.
<EOS>
Neither
dared
to
regard
the
other
;
and
a
profound
silence
prevailed
between
them
for
a
few
moments
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ebba
,
"
said
Auriol
at
length
,
"
I
am
about
to
leave
your
father
's
house
today
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Why
so
soon
?
<EOS>
"
she
exclaimed
,
looking
up
into
his
face
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
not
entirely
recovered
yet
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
dare
not
stay
longer
,
"
he
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
Dare
not
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Ebba
.
<EOS>
And
she
again
cast
down
her
eyes
;
but
Auriol
made
no
reply
.
 
<EOS>
Fortunately
the
silence
was
broken
by
the
clinking
of
the
smith
's
hammers
upon
the
anvil
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
must
really
go
,
"
said
Ebba
,
looking
up
,
after
a
long
pause
,
<EOS>
"
I
hope
we
shall
see
you
again
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Most
assuredly
,
"
replied
Auriol
.
<EOS>
"
I
owe
your
worthy
father
a
deep
debt
of
gratitude
--
a
debt
which
,
I
fear
,
I
shall
never
be
able
to
repay
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
My
father
is
more
than
repaid
in
saving
your
life
,
"
she
replied
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
he
will
be
sorry
to
learn
you
are
going
so
soon
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
here
a
week
,
"
said
Auriol
.
<EOS>
"
If
I
remained
longer
,
I
might
not
be
able
to
go
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
There
was
another
pause
,
during
which
a
stout
old
fellow
in
the
workshop
quitted
the
anvil
for
a
moment
,
and
,
catching
a
glimpse
of
the
young
couple
,
muttered
to
his
helpmate
:
 
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
Ned
,
I
'm
a
-
thinkin
'
our
master'll
soon
have
a
son
-
in
-
law
.
<EOS>
There
's
pretty
plain
signs
on
it
at
yonder
door
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
So
there
be
,
John
,
"
replied
Ned
,
peeping
round
.
"
<EOS>
He
's
a
good
-
lookin
'
young
feller
that
.
<EOS>
I
wish
ve
could
hear
their
discoorse
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
that
ai
n't
fair
,
"
replied
John
,
raking
some
small
coal
upon
the
fire
,
and
working
away
at
the
bellows
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
would
not
for
the
world
ask
a
disagreeable
question
,
"
said
Ebba
,
again
raising
her
eyes
,
"
<EOS>
but
since
you
are
about
to
quit
us
,
I
must
confess
I
should
like
to
know
something
of
your
history
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Forgive
me
if
I
decline
to
comply
with
your
desire
,
"
replied
Auriol
.
<EOS>
"
You
would
not
believe
me
,
were
I
to
relate
my
history
.
<EOS>
But
this
I
may
say
,
that
it
is
stranger
and
wilder
than
any
you
ever
heard
.
<EOS>
The
prisoner
,
in
his
cell
is
not
restrained
by
more
terrible
fetters
than
those
which
bind
me
to
silence
.
"
 
<EOS>
Ebba
gazed
at
him
as
if
she
feared
his
reasoning
were
wandering
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
think
me
mad
,
"
said
Auriol
;
"
would
I
were
so
!
<EOS>
But
I
shall
never
lose
the
clear
perception
of
my
woes
.
<EOS>
Hear
me
,
Ebba
!
<EOS>
Fate
has
brought
me
into
this
house
.
<EOS>
I
have
seen
you
,
and
experienced
your
gentle
ministry
;
and
it
is
impossible
,
so
circumstanced
,
to
be
blind
to
your
attractions
.
<EOS>
I
have
only
been
too
sensible
to
them
--
but
I
will
not
dwell
on
that
theme
,
nor
run
the
risk
of
exciting
a
passion
which
must
destroy
you
.
<EOS>
I
will
ask
you
to
hate
me
--
to
regard
me
as
a
monster
whom
you
ought
to
shun
rather
than
as
a
being
for
whom
you
should
entertain
the
slightest
sympathy
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
some
motive
in
saying
this
to
me
,
"
cried
the
terrified
girl
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
motive
is
to
warn
you
,
"
said
Auriol
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
love
me
,
you
are
lost
--
utterly
lost
!
"
 
<EOS>
She
was
so
startled
,
that
she
could
make
no
reply
,
but
burst
into
tears
.
<EOS>
Auriol
took
her
hand
,
which
she
unresistingly
yielded
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
terrible
fatality
attaches
to
me
,
in
which
you
must
have
no
share
,
"
he
said
,
in
a
solemn
tone
.
 
<EOS>
"
Would
you
had
never
come
to
my
father
's
house
!
"
<EOS>
she
exclaimed
,
in
a
voice
of
anguish
.
 
<EOS>
"
Is
it
,
then
,
too
late
?
"
cried
Auriol
,
despairingly
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
--
if
to
love
you
be
fatal
,
"
she
rejoined
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ha
!
"
exclaimed
Auriol
,
striking
his
forehead
with
his
clenched
hand
.
<EOS>
"
Recall
your
words
--
Ebba
--
recall
them
--
but
no
,
once
uttered
--
it
is
impossible
.
<EOS>
You
are
bound
to
me
for
ever
.
<EOS>
I
must
fulfil
my
destiny
.
"
 
<EOS>
At
this
juncture
a
low
growl
broke
from
the
dog
,
and
,
guided
by
the
sound
,
the
youthful
couple
beheld
,
standing
near
the
gate
,
the
tall
dark
man
in
the
black
cloak
.
<EOS>
A
fiendish
smile
sat
upon
his
countenance
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
is
the
man
who
frightened
me
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Ebba
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
the
person
I
supposed
!
"
ejaculated
Auriol
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
speak
to
him
.
<EOS>
Leave
me
,
Ebba
.
<EOS>
I
will
join
you
presently
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
as
the
girl
,
half
sinking
with
apprehension
,
withdrew
,
he
advanced
quickly
toward
the
intruder
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
sought
you
for
some
days
,
"
said
the
tall
man
,
in
a
stern
,
commanding
voice
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
not
kept
your
appointment
with
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
could
not
,
"
replied
Auriol--"an
accident
has
befallen
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
it
,
"
rejoined
the
other
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
aware
you
were
assailed
by
ruffians
in
the
ruined
house
over
the
way
.
<EOS>
But
you
are
recovered
now
,
and
can
go
forth
.
<EOS>
You
ought
to
have
communicated
with
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
was
my
intention
to
do
so
,
"
said
Auriol
.
 
<EOS>
"
Our
meeting
can
not
be
delayed
much
longer
,
"
pursued
the
stranger
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
give
you
three
more
days
.
<EOS>
On
the
evening
of
the
last
day
,
at
the
hour
of
seven
,
I
shall
look
for
you
at
the
foot
of
the
statue
in
Hyde
Park
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
be
there
,
"
replied
Auriol
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
girl
must
be
the
next
victim
,
"
said
the
stranger
,
with
a
grim
smile
.
 
<EOS>
"
Peace
!
"
thundered
Auriol
.
 
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
I
need
not
remind
you
of
the
tenure
by
which
you
maintain
your
power
,
"
rejoined
the
stranger
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
will
not
trouble
you
further
now
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
,
wrapping
his
cloak
more
closely
round
him
,
he
disappeared
.
 
<EOS>
"
Fate
has
once
more
involved
me
in
its
net
,
"
cried
Auriol
,
bitterly
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
will
save
Ebba
,
whatever
it
may
cost
me
.
<EOS>
I
will
see
her
no
more
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
instead
of
returning
to
the
house
,
he
hurried
away
in
the
opposite
direction
of
the
stranger
.
   
<EOS>
V.
THE
MEETING
NEAR
THE
STATUE
 
<EOS>
The
evening
of
the
third
day
arrived
,
and
Auriol
entered
Hyde
Park
by
Stanhope
-
gate
.
<EOS>
Glancing
at
his
watch
,
and
finding
it
wanted
nearly
three
quarters
of
an
hour
of
the
time
appointed
for
his
meeting
with
the
mysterious
stranger
,
he
struck
across
the
Park
,
in
the
direction
of
the
Serpentine
River
.
<EOS>
Apparently
he
was
now
perfectly
recovered
,
for
his
arm
was
without
the
support
of
the
sling
,
and
he
walked
with
great
swiftness
.
<EOS>
But
his
countenance
was
deathly
pale
,
and
his
looks
were
so
wild
and
disordered
,
that
the
few
persons
he
encountered
shrank
from
him
aghast
.
 
<EOS>
A
few
minutes
'
rapid
walking
brought
him
to
the
eastern
extremity
of
the
Serpentine
,
and
advancing
close
to
the
edge
of
the
embankment
,
he
gazed
at
the
waters
beneath
his
feet
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
would
plunge
into
them
,
if
I
could
find
repose
,
"
he
murmured
.
<EOS>
"
But
it
would
avail
nothing
.
<EOS>
I
should
only
add
to
my
sufferings
.
<EOS>
No
;
I
must
continue
to
endure
the
weight
of
a
life
burned
by
crime
and
remorse
,
till
I
can
find
out
the
means
of
freeing
myself
from
it
.
<EOS>
Once
I
dreaded
this
unknown
danger
,
but
now
I
seek
for
it
in
vain
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
current
of
his
thoughts
were
here
interrupted
by
the
sudden
appearance
of
a
dark
object
on
the
surface
of
the
water
,
which
he
at
first
took
to
he
a
huge
fish
,
with
a
pair
of
green
fins
springing
from
its
back
;
but
after
watching
it
more
closely
for
a
few
moments
,
he
became
convinced
that
it
was
a
human
being
,
tricked
out
in
some
masquerade
attire
,
while
the
slight
struggles
which
it
made
proved
that
life
was
not
entirely
extinct
.
 
<EOS>
Though
,
the
moment
before
,
he
had
contemplated
self
-
destruction
,
and
had
only
been
restrained
from
the
attempt
by
the
certainty
of
failing
in
his
purpose
,
instinct
prompted
him
to
rescue
the
perishing
creature
before
him
.
<EOS>
Without
hesitation
,
therefore
,
and
without
tarrying
to
divest
himself
of
his
clothes
,
he
dashed
into
the
water
,
and
striking
out
,
instantly
reached
the
object
of
his
quest
,
which
still
continued
to
float
,
and
turning
it
over
,
for
the
face
<EOS>
was
downwards
<EOS>
,
he
perceived
it
was
an
old
man
,
of
exceedingly
small
size
,
habited
in
a
pantomimic
garb
.
<EOS>
He
also
remarked
that
a
rope
was
twisted
round
the
neck
of
the
unfortunate
being
,
making
it
evident
that
some
violent
attempt
had
been
made
upon
his
life
.
 
<EOS>
Without
pausing
for
further
investigation
,
he
took
firm
hold
of
the
leathern
wings
of
the
dwarf
,
and
with
his
disengaged
hand
propelled
himself
towards
the
shore
,
dragging
the
other
after
him
.
<EOS>
The
next
instant
he
reached
the
bank
,
clambered
up
the
low
brickwork
,
and
placed
his
burden
in
safety
.
 
<EOS>
The
noise
of
the
plunge
had
attracted
attention
,
and
several
persons
now
hurried
to
the
spot
.
<EOS>
On
coming
up
,
and
finding
Auriol
bending
over
a
water
-
sprite
--
for
such
,
at
first
sight
,
the
dwarf
appeared
--
they
could
not
repress
their
astonishment
.
<EOS>
Wholly
insensible
to
the
presence
of
those
around
him
,
Auriol
endeavoured
to
recall
where
he
had
seen
the
dwarf
before
.
<EOS>
All
at
once
,
the
recollection
flashed
upon
him
,
and
he
cried
aloud
,
"
Why
,
it
is
my
poor
murdered
grandfather
's
attendant
,
Flapdragon
!
<EOS>
But
no
no!--he
must
be
dead
ages
ago
!
<EOS>
Yet
the
resemblance
is
singularly
striking
!
"
 
<EOS>
Auriol
's
exclamations
,
coupled
with
his
wild
demeanour
,
surprised
the
bystanders
,
and
they
came
to
the
conclusion
that
he
must
be
a
travelling
showman
,
who
had
attempted
to
drown
his
dwarf
--
the
grotesque
,
impish
garb
of
the
latter
convincing
them
that
he
had
been
exhibited
at
a
booth
.
<EOS>
They
made
signs
,
therefore
,
to
each
other
not
to
let
Auriol
escape
,
and
one
of
them
,
raising
the
dwarf
's
head
on
his
knee
,
produced
a
flask
,
and
poured
some
brandy
from
it
down
his
throat
,
while
others
chafed
his
hands
These
efforts
were
attended
with
much
speedier
success
than
might
have
been
anticipated
.
<EOS>
After
a
struggle
or
two
for
respiration
the
dwarf
opened
his
eyes
,
and
gazed
at
the
group
around
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
must
be
Flapdragon
!
"
exclaimed
Auriol
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
who
calls
me
?
"
cried
the
dwarf
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
!
"
rejoined
Auriol
.
<EOS>
"
Do
you
not
recollect
me
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
To
be
sure
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
dwarf
,
gazing
at
him
fixedly
;
"
you
are--
"
<EOS>
and
he
stopped
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
been
thrown
into
the
water
,
Master
Flapdragon
?
<EOS>
"
cried
a
bystander
,
noticing
the
cord
round
the
dwarf
's
throat
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
,
"
replied
the
little
old
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
By
your
governor
--
that
is
,
by
this
person
?
"
cried
another
,
laying
hold
of
Auriol
.
 
<EOS>
"
By
him
--
no
,
"
said
the
dwarf
;
"
I
have
not
seen
that
gentleman
for
nearly
three
centuries
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Three
centuries
,
my
little
patriarch
?
"
said
the
man
who
had
given
him
the
brandy
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
That
's
a
long
time
.
<EOS>
Think
again
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
perfectly
true
,
nevertheless
,
"
replied
the
dwarf
.
 
<EOS>
"
His
wits
have
been
washed
away
by
the
water
,
"
said
the
first
speaker
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Give
him
a
drop
more
brandy
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Not
a
bit
of
it
,
"
rejoined
the
dwarf
;
"
my
senses
were
never
clearer
than
at
this
moment
.
<EOS>
At
last
we
have
met
,
"
he
continued
,
addressing
Auriol
,
"
and
I
hope
we
shall
not
speedily
part
again
.
<EOS>
We
hold
life
by
the
same
tie
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
How
came
you
in
the
desperate
condition
in
which
I
found
you
?
"
demanded
Auriol
,
evasively
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
was
thrown
into
the
canal
with
a
stone
to
my
neck
,
like
a
dog
about
to
be
drowned
,
"
replied
the
dwarf
.
"
<EOS>
But
,
as
you
are
aware
,
I
'm
not
so
easily
disposed
of
.
"
 
<EOS>
Again
the
bystanders
exchanged
significant
looks
.
 
<EOS>
"
By
whom
was
the
attempt
made
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Auriol
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
the
villain
's
name
,
"
rejoined
the
dwarf
,
"
but
he
's
a
very
tall
,
dark
man
,
and
is
generally
wrapped
in
a
long
black
cloak
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ha
!
"
exclaimed
Auriol
.
<EOS>
"
When
was
it
done
?
"
 
"
Some
nights
ago
,
I
should
fancy
,
"
replied
the
dwarf
,
"
for
I
've
been
a
terrible
long
time
under
water
.
<EOS>
I
have
only
just
managed
to
shake
off
the
stone
.
"
 
<EOS>
At
this
speech
there
was
a
titter
of
incredulity
among
the
bystanders
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
may
laugh
,
but
it
's
true
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
dwarf
,
angrily
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
must
speak
of
this
anon
,
"
said
Auriol
.
<EOS>
"
Will
you
convey
him
to
the
nearest
tavern
?
"
<EOS>
he
added
,
placing
money
in
the
hands
of
the
man
who
held
the
dwarf
in
his
arms
.
 
<EOS>
"
Willingly
,
sir
,
"
replied
the
man
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
take
him
to
the
Life
Guardsman
,
near
the
barracks
,
that
's
the
nearest
public
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
'll
join
him
there
in
an
hour
,
"
replied
Auriol
,
moving
away
.
 
<EOS>
And
as
he
disappeared
,
the
man
took
up
his
little
burden
,
and
bent
his
steps
towards
the
barracks
.
 
<EOS>
Utterly
disregarding
the
dripping
state
of
his
habiliments
,
Auriol
proceeded
quickly
to
the
place
of
rendezvous
.
<EOS>
Arrived
there
,
he
looked
around
,
and
not
seeing
any
one
,
flung
himself
upon
a
bench
at
the
foot
of
the
gentle
eminence
on
which
the
gigantic
statue
of
Achilles
is
placed
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
becoming
rapidly
dark
,
and
heavy
clouds
,
portending
speedy
rain
,
increased
the
gloom
.
<EOS>
Auriol
's
thoughts
were
sombre
as
the
weather
and
the
hour
,
and
he
fell
into
a
deep
fit
of
abstraction
,
from
which
he
was
roused
by
a
hand
laid
on
his
shoulder
.
 
<EOS>
Recoiling
at
the
touch
,
he
raised
his
eyes
,
and
beheld
the
stranger
leaning
over
him
,
and
gazing
at
him
with
a
look
of
diabolical
exultation
.
<EOS>
The
cloak
was
thrown
partly
aside
,
so
as
to
display
the
tall
,
gaunt
figure
of
its
wearer
;
while
the
large
collar
of
sable
fur
with
which
it
was
decorated
stood
out
like
the
wings
of
a
demon
.
<EOS>
The
stranger
's
hat
was
off
,
and
his
high
broad
forehead
,
white
as
marble
,
was
fully
revealed
.
 
<EOS>
"
Our
meeting
must
be
brief
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
Are
you
prepared
to
fulfill
the
compact
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
require
?
"
replied
Auriol
.
 
<EOS>
"
Possession
of
the
girl
I
saw
three
days
ago
,
"
said
the
other
;
"
the
iron
-
merchant
's
daughter
,
Ebba
.
<EOS>
She
must
be
mine
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Never
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Auriol
,
firmly--"never
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Beware
how
you
tempt
me
to
exert
my
power
,
"
said
the
stranger
;
<EOS>
"
she
must
be
mine
--
or---
<EOS>
"
 
"
I
defy
you
!
"
rejoined
Auriol
;
"
I
will
never
consent
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Fool
!
"
cried
the
other
,
seizing
him
by
the
arm
,
and
fixing
a
withering
glance
upon
him
.
<EOS>
"
Bring
her
to
me
ere
<EOS>
the
week
be
out
,
or
dread
my
vengeance
!
"
 
<EOS>
And
,
enveloping
himself
in
his
cloak
,
he
retreated
behind
the
statue
,
and
was
lost
to
view
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
disappeared
,
a
moaning
wind
arose
,
and
heavy
rain
descended
.
<EOS>
Still
Auriol
did
not
quit
the
bench

INTERMEAN
   
<EOS>
I.
THE
TOMB
OF
THE
ROSICRUCIAN
 
<EOS>
On
the
night
of
the
1st
of
March
,
1800
,
and
at
a
late
hour
,
a
man
,
wrapped
in
a
large
horseman
's
cloak
,
and
of
strange
and
sinister
appearance
,
entered
an
old
deserted
house
in
the
neighbourhood
of
Stepney
-
green
.
<EOS>
He
was
tall
,
carried
himself
very
erect
,
and
seemed
in
the
full
vigour
of
early
manhood
;
but
his
features
had
a
worn
and
ghastly
look
,
as
if
bearing
the
stamp
of
long
-
indulged
and
frightful
excesses
,
while
his
dark
gleaming
eyes
gave
him
an
expression
almost
diabolical
.
 
<EOS>
This
person
had
gained
the
house
from
a
garden
behind
it
,
and
now
stood
in
a
large
dismantled
hall
,
from
which
a
broad
oaken
staircase
,
with
curiously
-
carved
banisters
,
led
to
a
gallery
,
and
hence
to
the
upper
chambers
of
the
habitation
.
<EOS>
Nothing
could
be
more
dreary
than
the
aspect
of
the
place
.
<EOS>
The
richly
moulded
ceiling
was
festooned
with
spiders
'
webs
,
and
in
some
places
had
fallen
in
heaps
upon
the
floor
;
the
glories
of
the
tapestry
upon
the
walls
were
obliterated
by
damps
;
the
squares
and
black
and
white
marble
,
with
which
the
hall
was
paved
,
were
loosened
,
and
quaked
beneath
the
footsteps
;
the
wide
and
empty
fireplace
yawned
like
the
mouth
of
a
cavern
;
the
bolts
of
the
closed
windows
were
rusted
in
their
sockets
;
and
the
heaps
of
dust
before
the
outer
door
proved
that
long
years
had
elapsed
since
any
one
had
passed
through
it
.
 
<EOS>
Taking
a
dark
lantern
from
beneath
his
cloak
,
the
individual
in
question
gazed
for
a
moment
around
him
,
and
then
,
with
a
sardonic
smile
playing
upon
his
features
,
directed
his
steps
towards
a
room
on
the
right
,
the
door
of
which
stood
open
.
 
<EOS>
This
chamber
,
which
was
large
and
cased
with
oak
,
was
wholly
unfurnished
,
like
the
hall
,
and
in
an
equally
dilapidated
condition
.
<EOS>
The
only
decoration
remaining
on
its
walls
was
the
portrait
of
a
venerable
personage
in
the
cap
and
gown
of
Henry
the
Eighth
's
time
,
painted
against
a
panel
--
a
circumstance
which
had
probably
saved
it
from
destruction
and
beneath
it
,
fixed
in
another
panel
,
a
plate
of
brass
,
covered
with
mystical
characters
and
symbols
,
and
inscribed
with
the
name
Cyprianus
de
Rougemont
,
Fra
.
<EOS>
R.C.
<EOS>
The
same
name
likewise
appeared
upon
a
label
beneath
the
portrait
,
with
the
date
,
1550
.
 
<EOS>
Pausing
before
the
portrait
,
the
young
man
threw
the
light
of
the
lantern
full
upon
it
,
and
revealed
features
somewhat
resembling
his
own
in
form
,
but
of
a
severe
and
philosophic
cast
.
<EOS>
In
the
eyes
alone
could
be
discerned
the
peculiar
and
terrible
glimmer
which
distinguished
his
own
glances
.
<EOS>
After
regarding
the
portrait
for
some
time
fixedly
,
he
thus
addressed
it
:
 
<EOS>
"
Dost
hear
me
,
old
ancestor
?
<EOS>
"
he
cried
.
<EOS>
"
I
,
thy
descendant
,
Cyprian
de
Rougemont
,
call
upon
thee
to
point
out
where
thy
gold
is
hidden
?
<EOS>
I
know
that
thou
wert
a
brother
of
the
Rosy
Cross
--
one
of
the
illuminati
--
and
didst
penetrate
the
mysteries
of
nature
,
and
enter
the
region
of
light
.
<EOS>
I
know
also
,
that
thou
wert
buried
in
this
house
with
a
vast
treasure
;
but
though
I
have
made
diligent
search
for
it
,
and
others
have
searched
before
me
,
thy
grave
has
never
yet
been
discovered
!
<EOS>
Listen
to
me
!
<EOS>
Methought
Satan
appeared
to
me
in
a
dream
last
night
,
and
bade
me
come
hither
,
and
I
should
find
what
I
sought
.
<EOS>
The
conditions
he
proposed
were
,
that
I
should
either
give
him
my
own
soul
,
or
win
him
that
of
Auriol
Darcy
.
<EOS>
I
assented
.
<EOS>
I
am
here
.
<EOS>
Where
is
thy
treasure
?
"
 
<EOS>
After
a
pause
,
he
struck
the
portrait
with
his
clenched
hand
,
exclaiming
in
a
loud
voice
:
 
<EOS>
"
Dost
hear
me
,
I
say
,
old
ancestor
?
<EOS>
I
call
on
thee
to
give
me
thy
treasure
.
<EOS>
Dost
hear
,
I
say
?
"
 
<EOS>
And
he
repeated
the
blow
with
greater
violence
.
 
<EOS>
Disturbed
by
the
shock
,
the
brass
plate
beneath
the
picture
started
from
its
place
,
and
fell
to
the
ground
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
is
this
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Rougemont
,
gazing
into
the
aperture
left
by
the
plate
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ha!--my
invocation
has
been
heard
!
"
 
<EOS>
And
,
snatching
up
the
lantern
,
he
discovered
,
at
the
bottom
of
a
little
recess
,
about
two
feet
deep
,
a
stone
,
with
an
iron
ring
in
the
centre
of
it
.
<EOS>
Uttering
a
joyful
cry
,
he
seized
the
ring
,
and
drew
the
stone
forward
without
difficulty
,
disclosing
an
open
space
beyond
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
This
,
then
,
'
is
the
entrance
to
my
ancestor
's
tomb
,
"
cried
Rougemont
;
"
there
can
be
no
doubt
of
it
.
<EOS>
The
old
Rosicrucian
has
kept
his
secret
well
;
but
the
devil
has
helped
me
to
wrest
it
from
him
.
<EOS>
And
now
to
procure
the
necessary
implements
,
in
case
,
as
is
not
unlikely
,
I
should
experience
further
difficulty
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
With
this
,
he
hastily
quitted
the
room
,
but
returned
almost
immediately
with
a
mallet
,
a
lever
,
and
a
pitchfork
;
armed
with
which
and
the
lantern
,
he
crept
through
the
aperture
.
<EOS>
This
done
,
he
found
himself
at
the
head
of
a
stone
staircase
,
which
he
descended
,
and
came
to
the
arched
entrance
of
a
vault
.
<EOS>
The
door
,
which
was
of
stout
oak
,
was
locked
,
but
holding
up
the
light
towards
it
,
he
read
the
following
inscription
:
 
POST
C.C.L.
ANNOS
PATEBO
,
1550
.
 
<EOS>
"
In
two
hundred
and
fifty
years
I
shall
open
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Rougemont
,
"
and
the
date
1550
-
-why
<EOS>
,
the
exact
time
is
arrived
.
<EOS>
Old
Cyprian
must
have
foreseen
what
would
happen
,
and
evidently
intended
to
make
me
his
heir
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
occasion
for
the
devil
's
interference
.
<EOS>
And
see
,
the
key
is
in
the
lock
.
<EOS>
So
!
<EOS>
"
And
he
turned
it
,
and
pushing
against
the
door
with
some
force
,
the
rusty
hinges
gave
way
,
and
it
fell
inwards
.
 
<EOS>
From
the
aperture
left
by
the
fallen
door
,
a
soft
and
silvery
light
,
streamed
forth
,
and
,
stepping
forward
,
Rougemont
found
himself
in
a
spacious
vault
,
from
the
ceiling
of
which
hung
a
large
globe
of
crystal
,
containing
in
its
heart
a
little
flame
,
which
diffused
a
radiance
gentle
as
that
of
the
moon
,
around
,
This
,
then
,
was
the
ever-
burning
lamp
of
the
Rosicrucians
,
and
Rougemont
gazed
at
if
with
astonishment
.
<EOS>
Two
hundred
and
fifty
years
had
elapsed
since
that
wondrous
flame
had
been
lighted
,
and
yet
it
burnt
on
brightly
as
ever
.
<EOS>
Hooped
round
the
globe
<EOS>
was
a
serpent
with
its
tail
in
its
mouth
--
an
emblem
of
eternity
--
<EOS>
wrought
in
purest
gold
;
while
above
it
were
a
pair
of
silver
wings
,
in
allusion
to
the
soul
.
<EOS>
Massive
chains
of
the
more
costly
metal
,
fashioned
like
twisted
snakes
,
served
as
suspenders
to
the
lamp
.
 
<EOS>
But
Rougemont
's
astonishment
at
this
marvel
quickly
gave
way
to
other
feelings
,
and
he
gazed
around
the
vault
with
greedy
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
septilateral
chamber
,
about
eight
feet
high
built
of
stone
,
and
supported
by
beautifully
groined
arches
.
<EOS>
The
surface
of
the
masonry
was
as
smooth
and
fresh
as
if
the
chisel
had
only
just
left
it
.
 
<EOS>
In
six
of
the
corners
were
placed
large
chests
,
ornamented
with
ironwork
of
the
most
exquisite
workmanship
,
and
these
Rougemont
's
imagination
pictured
as
filled
with
inexhaustible
treasure
;
while
in
the
seventh
corner
,
near
the
door
,
was
a
beautiful
little
piece
of
monumental
sculpture
in
white
marble
,
representing
two
kneeling
and
hooded
figures
,
holding
a
veil
between
them
,
which
partly
concealed
the
entrance
to
a
small
recess
.
<EOS>
On
one
of
the
chests
opposite
the
monument
just
described
stood
a
strangely
formed
bottle
and
a
cup
of
antique
workmanship
,
both
incrusted
with
gems
.
 
<EOS>
The
walls
were
covered
with
circles
,
squares
and
diagrams
,
and
in
some
places
were
ornamented
with
grotesque
carvings
.
<EOS>
In
the
centre
of
the
vault
was
a
round
altar
of
black
marble
,
covered
with
a
plate
of
gold
,
on
which
Rougemont
read
the
following
inscription
:
 
Hoc
universi
compendium
unius
mihi
sepulcrum
feci
.
 
<EOS>
"
Here
,
then
,
old
Cyprian
lies
,
"
he
cried
.
 
<EOS>
And
,
prompted
by
some
irresistible
impulse
,
he
seized
the
altar
by
the
upper
rim
,
and
overthrew
it
.
<EOS>
The
heavy
mass
of
marble
fell
with
a
thundering
crash
,
breaking
asunder
the
flag
beneath
it
.
<EOS>
It
might
be
the
reverberation
of
the
vaulted
roof
,
but
a
deep
groan
seemed
to
reproach
the
young
man
for
his
sacrilege
.
<EOS>
Undeterred
,
however
,
by
this
warning
,
Rougemont
placed
the
point
of
the
lever
between
the
interstices
of
the
broken
stone
,
and
,
exerting
all
his
strength
,
speedily
raised
the
fragments
,
and
laid
open
the
grave
.
 
<EOS>
Within
it
,
in
the
garb
he
wore
in
life
,
with
his
white
beard
streaming
to
his
waist
,
lay
the
unconfined
body
of
his
ancestor
,
Cyprian
de
Rougemont
.
<EOS>
The
corpse
had
evidently
been
carefully
embalmed
,
and
the
features
were
unchanged
by
decay
.
<EOS>
Upon
the
breast
,
with
the
hands
placed
over
it
,
lay
a
large
book
,
bound
in
black
vellum
,
and
fastened
with
brazen
clasps
.
<EOS>
Instantly
possessing
himself
of
this
mysterious
looking
volume
,
Rougemont
knelt
upon
the
nearest
chest
,
and
opened
it
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
disappointed
in
his
expectation
.
<EOS>
All
the
pages
he
examined
were
filled
with
cabalistic
characters
,
which
he
was
totally
unable
to
decipher
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
,
however
,
he
chanced
upon
One
page
,
the
import
of
which
he
comprehended
,
and
he
remained
for
some
time
absorbed
in
its
contemplation
,
while
an
almost
fiendish
smile
played
upon
his
features
.
 
<EOS>
"
Aha
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
,
closing
the
volume
,
"
I
see
now
the
cause
of
my
extraordinary
dream
.
<EOS>
My
ancestor
's
wondrous
power
was
of
infernal
origin
--
the
result
,
in
fact
,
of
a
compact
with
the
Prince
of
Darkness
.
<EOS>
But
what
care
I
for
that
?
<EOS>
Give
me
wealth
--
no
matter
what
source
it
comes
from!--ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
"
 
<EOS>
And
seizing
the
lever
,
he
broke
open
the
chest
beside
him
.
<EOS>
It
was
filled
with
bars
of
silver
.
<EOS>
The
next
he
visited
in
the
same
way
was
full
of
gold
.
<EOS>
The
third
was
laden
with
pearls
and
precious
stones
;
and
the
rest
contained
treasure
to
an
incalculable
amount
.
<EOS>
Rougemont
gazed
at
them
in
transports
of
joy
.
 
<EOS>
"
At
length
I
have
my
wish
,
"
he
cried
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Boundless
wealth
,
and
therefore
boundless
power
is
mine
.
<EOS>
I
can
riot
in
pleasure
--
<EOS>
riot
in
vengeance
.
<EOS>
As
to
my
soul
,
I
will
run
the
risk
of
its
perdition
;
but
it
shall
go
hard
if
I
destroy
not
that
of
Auriol
.
<EOS>
His
love
of
play
and
his
passion
for
Edith
Talbot
shall
be
the
means
by
which
I
will
work
.
<EOS>
But
I
must
not
neglect
another
agent
which
is
offered
me
.
<EOS>
That
bottle
,
I
have
learnt
from
yon
volume
,
contains
an
infernal
potion
,
which
,
without
destroying
life
,
shatters
the
brain
,
and
creates
maddening
fancies
.
<EOS>
It
will
well
serve
my
purpose
;
and
I
thank
thee
,
Satan
,
for
the
gift
.

THE
COMPACT
 
<EOS>
Another
two
months
after
this
occurrence
,
and
near
midnight
,
a
young
man
was
hurrying
along
Pall
-
mall
,
with
a
look
of
the
wildest
despair
,
when
his
headlong
course
was
suddenly
arrested
by
a
strong
grasp
,
while
a
familiar
voice
sounded
in
his
ear
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
useless
to
meditate
self
-
destruction
Auriol
Darcy
,
"
cried
the
person
who
had
checked
him
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
find
life
a
burden
,
I
can
make
it
tolerable
to
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
Turning
round
at
the
appeal
,
Auriol
beheld
a
tall
man
,
wrapped
in
a
long
black
cloak
,
whose
sinister
features
were
well
known
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Leave
me
,
Rougemont
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
,
fiercely
.
<EOS>
"
I
want
no
society
--
above
all
,
not
yours
.
<EOS>
You
know
very
well
that
you
have
ruined
me
,
and
that
nothing
more
is
to
be
got
from
me
.
<EOS>
Leave
me
,
I
say
,
or
I
may
do
you
a
mischief
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Tut
,
tut
,
Auriol
,
I
am
your
friend
!
"
<EOS>
replied
Rougemont
.
<EOS>
"
I
purpose
to
relieve
your
distress
.
"
<EOS>
"
Will
you
give
me
back
the
money
you
have
won
from
me
?
"
cried
Auriol
.
<EOS>
"
Will
you
pay
my
inexorable
creditors
?
<EOS>
Will
you
save
me
from
a
prison
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
do
all
this
,
and
more
,
"
replied
Rougemont
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
make
you
one
of
the
richest
men
in
London
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Spare
your
insulting
jests
,
sir
,
"
cried
Auriol
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
in
no
mood
to
bear
them
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
jesting
,
"
rejoined
Rougemont
.
<EOS>
"
Come
with
me
,
and
you
shall
be
convinced
of
my
sincerity
.
"
 
<EOS>
Auriol
at
length
assented
,
and
they
turned
into
Saint
James's
-
square
,
and
paused
before
a
magnificent
house
.
<EOS>
Rougemont
ascended
the
steps
.
<EOS>
Auriol
,
who
had
accompanied
him
almost
mechanically
,
gazed
at
him
with
astonishment
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
you
live
here
?
<EOS>
"
he
inquired
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ask
no
questions
,
"
replied
Rougemont
,
knocking
at
the
door
,
which
was
instantly
opened
by
a
hall
porter
,
while
other
servants
in
rich
liveries
appeared
at
a
distance
.
<EOS>
Rougemont
addressed
a
few
words
in
an
undertone
to
them
,
and
they
instantly
bowed
respectfully
to
Auriol
,
while
the
foremost
of
them
led
the
way
up
a
magnificent
staircase
.
 
<EOS>
All
this
was
a
mystery
to
the
young
man
,
but
he
followed
his
conductor
without
a
word
,
and
was
presently
ushered
into
a
gorgeously
furnished
and
brilliantly
illuminated
apartment
.
 
<EOS>
The
servant
then
left
them
;
and
as
soon
as
he
was
gone
Auriol
exclaimed--"Is
it
to
mock
me
that
you
have
brought
me
hither
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
To
mock
you
--
no
,
"
replied
Rougemont
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
told
you
that
I
mean
to
make
you
rich
.
<EOS>
But
you
look
greatly
exhausted
.
<EOS>
A
glass
of
wine
will
revive
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
as
he
spoke
,
he
stepped
towards
a
small
cabinet
,
and
took
from
it
a
curiously
-
shaped
bottle
and
a
goblet
.
 
<EOS>
"
Taste
this
wine
--
it
has
been
long
in
our
family
,
"
he
added
,
filling
the
cup
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
strange
,
bewildering
drink
,
"
cried
Auriol
,
setting
down
the
empty
goblet
,
and
passing
his
hand
before
his
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
taken
it
upon
an
empty
stomach
--
that
is
all
,
"
said
Rougemont
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
be
better
anon
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
feel
as
if
I
were
going
mad
,
"
cried
Auriol
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
some
damnable
potion
you
have
given
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ha
!
ha
!
"
laughed
Rougemont
.
<EOS>
"
It
reminds
you
of
the
elixir
you
once
quaffed
--
eh
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
A
truce
to
this
raillery
!
"
cried
Auriol
,
angrily
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
said
I
am
in
no
mood
to
bear
it
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Pshaw
!
<EOS>
I
mean
no
offence
,
"
rejoined
the
other
,
changing
his
manner
.
<EOS>
"
What
think
you
of
this
house
?
"
 
"
That
it
is
magnificent
,
"
replied
Auriol
,
gazing
around
.
<EOS>
"
I
envy
you
its
possession
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
shall
be
yours
,
if
you
please
,
"
replied
Rougemont
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mine
!
<EOS>
you
are
mocking
me
again
.
<EOS>
"
 
"
Not
in
the
least
.
<EOS>
You
shall
buy
it
from
me
,
if
you
please
.
"
<EOS>
'
 
<EOS>
"
At
what
price
?
"
asked
Auriol
,
bitterly
.
 
<EOS>
"
At
a
price
you
can
easily
pay
,
"
replied
the
other
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Come
this
way
,
and
we
will
conclude
the
bargain
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Proceeding
towards
the
farther
end
of
the
room
,
they
entered
a
small
exquisitely
furnished
chamber
,
surrounded
with
sofas
of
the
most
luxurious
description
.
<EOS>
In
the
midst
was
a
table
,
on
which
writing
materials
were
placed
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
were
a
fruitless
boon
to
give
you
this
house
without
the
means
of
living
in
it
,
"
said
Rougemont
,
carefully
closing
the
door
.
<EOS>
"
This
pocket
-
book
will
furnish
you
with
them
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Notes
to
an
immense
amount
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Auriol
,
opening
the
pocket
-
book
,
and
glancing
at
its
contents
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
are
yours
,
together
with
the
house
,
"
cried
Rougemont
,
"
if
you
will
but
sign
a
compact
with
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
A
compact
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Auriol
,
regarding
him
with
a
look
of
undefinable
terror
.
<EOS>
"
Who
and
what
are
you
?
"
 
"
Some
men
would
call
me
the
devil
!
"
<EOS>
replied
Rougemont
,
carelessly
.
<EOS>
"
But
you
know
me
too
well
to
suppose
that
I
merit
such
a
designation
.
<EOS>
I
offer
you
wealth
.
<EOS>
What
more
could
you
require
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
upon
what
terms
?
"
demanded
Auriol
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
easiest
imaginable
,
"
replied
the
other
.
<EOS>
"
You
shall
judge
for
yourself
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
as
he
spoke
,
he
opened
a
writing
-
desk
upon
the
table
,
and
took
from
it
a
parchment
.
 
<EOS>
"
Sit
down
,
"
he
added
,
"
and
read
this
.
"
 
<EOS>
Auriol
complied
,
and
as
he
scanned
the
writing
he
became
transfixed
with
fear
and
astonishment
,
while
the
pocket
-
book
dropped
from
his
grasp
.
 
<EOS>
After
a
while
,
he
looked
up
at
Rougemont
,
who
was
leaning
over
his
shoulder
,
and
whose
features
were
wrinkled
with
a
derisive
smile
.
 
<EOS>
"
Then
you
are
the
Fiend
?
<EOS>
"
he
cried
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
you
will
have
it
so
--
certainly
,
"
replied
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
Satan
in
the
form
of
the
man
I
once
knew
,
"
cried
Auriol
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Avaunt
!
<EOS>
I
will
have
no
dealings
with
you
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
thought
you
wiser
than
to
indulge
in
such
idle
fears
,
Darcy
,
"
rejoined
the
other
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Granting
even
your
silly
notion
of
me
to
be
correct
,
what
need
you
be
alarmed
?
<EOS>
You
are
immortal
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
True
,
"
rejoined
Auriol
thoughtfully
;
"
but
yet---
"
 
"
Pshaw
!
"
<EOS>
rejoined
the
other
,
"
sign
and
have
done
with
the
matter
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
By
this
compact
I
am
bound
to
deliver
a
victim
--
a
female
<EOS>
victim--
<EOS>
whenever
you
shall
require
it
,
"
cried
Auriol
.
 
<EOS>
"
Precisely
,
"
replied
the
other
;
"
you
can
have
no
difficulty
in
fulfilling
that
condition
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
if
I
fail
in
doing
so
,
I
am
doomed---
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
you
will
not
fail
,
"
interrupted
the
other
,
lighting
a
taper
,
and
sealing
the
parchment
.
<EOS>
"
Now
sign
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
Auriol
mechanically
took
the
pen
,
and
gazed
fixedly
on
the
document
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
bring
eternal
destruction
on
myself
if
I
sign
it
,
"
he
muttered
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
stroke
of
the
pen
will
rescue
you
from
utter
ruin
,
"
said
Rougemont
,
leaning
over
his
shoulder
.
<EOS>
"
Riches
and
happiness
are
yours
.
<EOS>
You
will
not
have
such
another
chance
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Tempter
!
"
cried
Auriol
,
hastily
attaching
his
signature
to
the
paper
.
<EOS>
But
he
instantly
started
back
aghast
at
the
fiendish
laugh
that
rang
in
his
ears
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
repent
--
give
it
me
back
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
,
endeavouring
to
snatch
the
parchment
which
Rougemont
thrust
into
his
bosom
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
too
late
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
latter
,
in
a
triumphant
tone
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
mine
--
irredeemably
mine
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ha
!
"
exclaimed
Auriol
,
sinking
back
on
the
couch
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
leave
you
in
possession
of
your
house
,
"
pursued
Rougemont
;
"
but
I
shall
return
in
a
week
,
when
I
shall
require
my
first
victim
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Your
first
victim
!
<EOS>
oh
,
Heaven
!
"
exclaimed
Auriol
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
and
my
choice
falls
on
Edith
Talbot
!
"
replied
Rougemont
.
 
<EOS>
"
Edith
Talbot
!
"
exclaimed
Auriol
;
"
she
your
victim
!
<EOS>
Think
you
I
would
resign
her
<EOS>
I
love
better
than
life
to
you
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
because
she
loves
you
that
I
have
chosen
her
,
"
rejoined
Rougemont
,
with
a
bitter
laugh
.
"
<EOS>
And
such
will
ever
be
the
case
with
you
.
<EOS>
Seek
not
to
love
again
,
for
your
passion
will
be
fatal
to
the
object
of
it
.
<EOS>
When
the
week
has
elapsed
,
I
shall
require
Edith
at
your
hands
.
<EOS>
Till
then
,
farewell
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Stay
!
"
cried
Auriol
.
<EOS>
"
I
break
the
bargain
with
thee
,
fiend
.
<EOS>
I
will
have
none
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
abjure
thee
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
he
rushed
wildly
after
Rougemont
,
who
had
already
gained
the
larger
chamber
;
but
,
<EOS>
ere
he
could
reach
him
,
the
mysterious
individual
had
passed
through
the
outer
door
,
and
when
Auriol
emerged
upon
the
gallery
,
he
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
.
 
<EOS>
Several
servants
immediately
answered
the
frantic
shouts
of
the
young
man
,
and
informed
him
that
Mr.
Rougemont
had
quitted
the
house
some
moments
ago
,
telling
them
that
their
master
was
perfectly
satisfied
with
the
arrangements
he
had
made
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
we
hope
nothing
has
occurred
to
alter
your
opinion
,
sir
?
"
said
the
hall
porter
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
sure
Mr.
Rougemont
is
gone
?
"
cried
Auriol
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
quite
sure
,
sir
,
"
cried
the
hall
porter
.
<EOS>
"
I
helped
him
on
with
his
cloak
myself
.
<EOS>
He
said
he
should
return
this
day
week
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
If
he
comes
I
will
not
see
him
,
"
cried
Auriol
,
sharply
;
"
mind
that
.
<EOS>
Deny
me
to
him
;
and
on
no
account
whatever
let
him
enter
the
house
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Your
orders
shall
be
strictly
obeyed
,
"
replied
the
porter
,
staring
with
surprise
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
leave
me
,
"
cried
Auriol
.
 
<EOS>
And
as
they
quitted
him
,
he
added
,
in
a
tone
and
with
a
gesture
of
the
deepest
despair
,
"
All
precautions
are
useless
.
<EOS>
I
am
indeed
lost
!

III

<EOS>
IRRESOLUTION
 
On
returning
to
the
cabinet
,
where
his
fatal
compact
with
Rougemont
had
been
signed
,
Auriol
perceived
the
pocket
-
book
lying
on
the
floor
near
the
table
,
and
,
taking
it
up
<EOS>
,
he
was
about
to
deposit
it
in
the
writing
-
desk
,
when
an
irresistible
impulse
prompted
him
once
more
to
examine
its
contents
.
<EOS>
Unfolding
the
roll
of
notes
,
he
counted
them
,
and
found
they
amounted
to
more
than
a
hundred
thousand
pounds
.
<EOS>
The
sight
of
so
much
wealth
,
and
the
thought
of
the
pleasure
and
the
power
it
would
procure
him
,
gradually
dispelled
his
fears
,
and
arising
in
a
transport
of
delight
,
he
exclaimed--"Yes
,
yes
--
all
obstacles
are
now
removed
!
<EOS>
When
Mr.
Talbot
finds
I
am
become
thus
wealthy
,
he
will
no
longer
refuse
me
his
daughter
.
<EOS>
But
I
am
mad
,
"
he
added
,
suddenly
checking
himself--"worse
than
mad
,
to
indulge
such
hopes
.
<EOS>
If
it
be
indeed
the
Fiend
to
whom
I
have
sold
myself
,
I
have
no
help
from
perdition
!
<EOS>
if
it
be
man
,
I
am
scarcely
less
terribly
fettered
.
<EOS>
In
either
case
,
I
will
not
,
remain
here
longer
;
nor
will
I
avail
myself
of
this
accursed
money
,
which
has
tempted
me
to
my
undoing
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
,
hurling
the
pocket
-
book
to
the
farther
end
of
the
room
,
he
was
about
to
pass
through
the
door
,
when
a
mocking
laugh
arrested
him
.
<EOS>
He
looked
round
with
astonishment
and
dread
,
but
could
see
no
one
.
<EOS>
After
a
while
,
he
again
moved
forward
,
but
a
voice
,
which
he
recognised
as
that
of
Rougemont
,
called
upon
him
to
stay
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
will
be
in
vain
to
fly
,
"
said
the
unseen
speaker
.
<EOS>
"
You
can
not
escape
me
.
<EOS>
Whether
you
remain
here
or
not
--
whether
you
use
the
wealth
I
have
given
you
,
or
leave
it
behind
you
--
you
can
not
annul
your
bargain
.
<EOS>
With
this
knowledge
,
you
are
at
liberty
to
go
.
<EOS>
But
remember
,
on
the
seventh
night
from
this
I
shall
require
Edith
Talbot
from
you
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Where
are
you
fiend
?
"
demanded
Auriol
,
gazing
around
,
furiously
.
"
<EOS>
Show
yourself
,
that
I
may
confront
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
A
mocking
laugh
was
the
only
response
deigned
to
this
injunction
.
 
<EOS>
"
Give
me
back
the
compact
,
"
cried
Auriol
,
imploringly
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
signed
in
ignorance
.
<EOS>
I
knew
not
the
price
<EOS>
I
was
to
pay
for
your
assistance
.
<EOS>
Wealth
is
of
no
value
to
me
without
Edith
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Without
wealth
you
could
not
obtain
her
,
"
replied
the
voice
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
only
,
therefore
,
where
you
were
.
<EOS>
But
you
will
think
better
of
the
bargain
tomorrow
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
I
counsel
you
to
place
the
money
you
have
so
unwisely
cast
from
you
safely
under
lock
and
key
,
and
to
seek
repose
.
<EOS>
You
will
awaken
with
very
different
thoughts
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
How
am
I
to
account
for
my
sudden
accession
of
wealth
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Auriol
,
after
a
pause
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
a
gambler
,
and
ask
that
question
!
"
returned
the
unseen
stranger
with
a
bitter
laugh
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
will
make
your
mind
easy
on
that
score
.
<EOS>
As
regards
the
house
,
you
will
find
a
regular
conveyance
of
it
within
that
writing
-
desk
,
while
the
note
lying
on
the
table
,
which
bears
your
address
,
comes
from
me
,
and
announces
the
payment
of
a
hundred
and
twenty
thousand
pounds
to
you
,
as
a
debt
of
honour
.
<EOS>
You
see
I
have
provided
against
every
difficulty
.
<EOS>
And
now
farewell
!
"
 
<EOS>
The
voice
was
then
hushed
;
and
though
Auriol
addressed
several
other
questions
to
the
unseen
speaker
no
answer
was
returned
him
.
 
<EOS>
After
some
moments
of
irresolution
,
Auriol
once
more
took
up
the
pocket
-
book
,
and
deposited
it
in
the
writing
-
desk
,
in
which
he
found
,
as
he
had
been
led
to
expect
,
a
deed
conveying
the
house
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
then
opened
the
note
lying
upon
the
table
,
and
found
its
contents
accorded
with
what
had
just
been
told
him
.
<EOS>
Placing
it
with
the
pocket-
book
,
he
locked
the
writing
-
desk
,
exclaiming
,
"
It
is
useless
to
struggle
further
--
I
must
yield
to
fate
!
"
 
<EOS>
This
done
,
he
went
into
the
adjoining
room
,
and
,
casting
his
eyes
about
,
remarked
the
antique
bottle
and
flagon
.
<EOS>
The
latter
was
filled
to
the
brim
--
how
or
with
what
,
Auriol
paused
not
to
examine
;
but
seizing
the
cup
with
desperation
,
he
placed
it
to
his
lips
,
and
emptied
it
at
a
draught
.
<EOS>
A
species
of
intoxication
,
but
pleasing
as
that
produced
by
opium
,
presently
succeeded
.
<EOS>
All
his
fears
left
him
,
and
in
their
place
the
gentlest
and
most
delicious
fancies
arose
.
<EOS>
Surrendering
himself
delightedly
to
their
influence
,
he
sank
upon
a
couch
,
and
for
some
time
was
wrapped
in
a
dreamy
elysium
,
imagining
himself
wandering
with
Edith
Talbot
in
a
lovely
garden
,
redolent
of
sweets
,
and
vocal
with
the
melody
of
birds
.
<EOS>
Their
path
led
through
a
grove
,
in
the
midst
of
which
was
a
fountain
;
and
they
were
hastening
towards
its
marble
brink
,
when
all
at
once
Edith
uttered
a
scream
,
and
,
starting
back
,
pointed
to
a
large
black
snake
lying
before
her
,
and
upon
which
she
would
have
trodden
the
next
moment
.
<EOS>
Auriol
sprang
forward
and
tried
to
crush
the
reptile
with
his
heel
;
but
,
avoiding
the
blow
,
it
coiled
around
his
leg
,
and
plunged
its
venom
teeth
into
his
flesh
.
<EOS>
The
anguish
occasioned
by
the
imaginary
wound
roused
him
from
his
slumber
,
and
looking
up
,
he
perceived
that
a
servant
was
in
attendance
.
 
<EOS>
Bowing
<EOS>
obsequiously
,
the
man
inquired
whether
he
had
occasion
for
anything
.
 
<EOS>
"
Show
me
to
my
bedroom
--
that
is
all
I
require
,
"
replied
Auriol
,
scarcely
able
to
shake
off
the
effect
of
the
vision
.
 
<EOS>
And
,
getting
up
,
he
followed
the
man
,
almost
mechanically
,
out
of
the
room
.

<EOS>
EDITH
<EOS>
TALBOT
 
<EOS>
It
was
late
when
Auriol
arose
on
the
following
morning
.
<EOS>
At
first
,
finding
himself
in
a
large
and
most
luxuriantly
furnished
chamber
,
he
was
at
a
loss
to
conceive
how
he
came
there
,
and
it
was
some
time
before
he
could
fully
recall
the
mysterious
events
of
the
previous
night
.
<EOS>
As
had
been
foretold
,
however
,
by
Rougemont
,
his
position
did
not
cause
him
so
much
anxiety
as
before
.
 
<EOS>
After
attiring
himself
,
he
descended
to
the
lower
apartments
,
in
one
of
which
a
sumptuous
breakfast
awaited
him
;
and
having
partaken
of
it
,
he
took
a
complete
survey
of
the
house
,
and
found
it
larger
and
more
magnificent
even
than
he
had
supposed
it
.
<EOS>
He
next
supplied
himself
from
the
pocket
-
book
with
a
certain
sum
,
for
which
he
fancied
he
might
have
occasion
in
the
course
of
the
day
,
and
sallied
forth
.
<EOS>
His
first
business
was
to
procure
a
splendid
carriage
and
horse
,
and
to
order
some
new
and
rich
habiliments
to
be
made
with
the
utmost
expedition
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
proceeded
towards
May
Fair
,
and
knocked
at
the
door
of
a
large
house
at
the
upper
end
of
Curzon
-
street
.
<EOS>
His
heart
beat
violently
as
he
was
shown
into
an
elegant
drawing
-
room
,
and
his
trepidation
momentarily
increased
,
until
the
servant
reappeared
and
expressed
his
regret
that
he
had
misinformed
him
in
stating
that
Miss
Talbot
was
at
home
.
<EOS>
Both
she
and
Mr.
Talbot
,
he
said
,
had
gone
out
about
half
an
hour
ago
.
<EOS>
Auriol
looked
incredulous
,
but
,
without
making
any
remark
,
departed
.
<EOS>
Hurrying
home
,
he
wrote
a
few
lines
to
Mr.
Talbot
,
announcing
the
sudden
and
extraordinary
change
in
his
fortune
,
and
formally
demanding
the
hand
of
Edith
.
<EOS>
He
was
about
to
despatch
this
letter
,
when
a
note
was
brought
him
by
his
servant
.
<EOS>
It
was
from
Edith
.
<EOS>
Having
ascertained
his
new
address
from
his
card
,
she
wrote
to
assure
him
of
her
constant
attachment
.
<EOS>
Transported
by
this
proof
of
her
affection
,
Auriol
half
devoured
the
note
with
kisses
,
and
instantly
sent
off
his
own
letter
to
her
father
--
merely
adding
a
few
words
to
say
that
he
would
call
for
an
answer
on
the
morrow
.
<EOS>
But
he
had
not
to
wait
thus
long
for
a
reply
.
<EOS>
Ere
an
hour
had
elapsed
,
Mr.
Talbot
brought
it
in
person
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Talbot
was
a
man
of
about
sixty
--
tall
,
thin
,
and
gentlemanlike
in
deportment
,
with
grey
hair
,
and
black
eyebrows
,
which
lent
considerable
expression
to
the
orbs
beneath
them
.
<EOS>
His
complexion
was
a
bilious
brown
,
and
he
possessed
none
of
the
good
looks
which
in
his
daughter
had
so
captivated
Auriol
,
and
which
it
is
to
be
presumed
,
therefore
,
she
inherited
from
her
mother
.
 
<EOS>
A
thorough
man
of
the
world
,
though
not
an
unamiable
person
,
Mr.
Talbot
was
entirely
influenced
by
selfish
considerations
.
<EOS>
He
had
hitherto
looked
with
an
unfavourable
eye
upon
Auriol
's
attentions
to
his
daughter
,
from
a
notion
that
the
connection
would
be
very
undesirable
in
a
pecuniary
point
of
view
;
but
the
magnificence
of
the
house
in
Saint
James
's
square
,
which
fully
bore
out
Auriol
's
account
of
his
newly
acquired
wealth
,
wrought
a
complete
change
in
his
opinions
,
and
he
soon
gave
the
young
man
to
understand
that
he
should
be
delighted
to
have
him
for
a
son
-
in
-
law
.
<EOS>
Finding
him
so
favourably
disposed
,
Auriol
entreated
him
to
let
the
marriage
take
place
--
within
three
days
,
if
possible
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Talbot
was
greatly
grieved
that
he
could
not
comply
with
his
young
friend
's
request
<EOS>
but
he
was
obliged
to
start
the
next
morning
for
Nottingham
and
could
not
possibly
return
under
three
days
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
we
can
be
married
before
you
go
?
"
cried
Auriol
.
 
<EOS>
"
Scarcely
,
I
fear
,
"
replied
Mr.
Talbot
,
smiling
blandly
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
control
your
impatience
,
my
dear
young
friend
.
<EOS>
On
the
sixth
day
from
this
--
that
is
;
on
Wednesday
in
next
week
--
we
are
now
at
Friday
--
you
shall
be
made
happy
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
coincidence
between
this
appointment
and
the
time
fixed
by
Rougemont
for
the
delivery
of
his
victim
,
struck
Auriol
forcibly
.
<EOS>
His
emotion
however
,
escaped
Mr.
Talbot
,
who
soon
after
departed
,
having
engaged
his
future
son
-
in
-
law
to
dine
with
him
at
seven
o'clock
.
 
<EOS>
Auriol
it
need
scarcely
be
said
,
was
punctual
to
the
hour
,
or
,
rather
,
he
anticipated
it
.
<EOS>
He
found
Edith
alone
in
the
drawing
-
room
,
and
seated
near
the
window
,
which
was
filled
with
choicest
flowers
.
<EOS>
On
seeing
him
,
she
uttered
an
exclamation
of
joy
,
and
sprang
to
meet
him
.
<EOS>
The
young
man
pressed
his
lips
fervently
to
the
little
hand
extended
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
Edith
Talbot
was
a
lovely
brunette
.
<EOS>
Her
features
were
regular
,
and
her
eyes
which
were
perfectly
splendid
were
dark
,
almond
-
shaped
,
and
of
almost
Oriental
languor
.
<EOS>
Her
hair
which
she
wore
braided
over
her
brow
and
gathered
behind
in
a
massive
roll
,
was
black
and
glossy
as
a
raven
's
wing
.
<EOS>
Her
cheeks
were
dimpled
,
her
lips
of
velvet
softness
and
her
teeth
like
ranges
of
pearls
.
<EOS>
Perfect
grace
accompanied
all
her
movements
,
and
one
only
wondered
that
feet
so
small
as
those
she
possessed
should
have
the
power
of
sustaining
a
form
which
,
though
lightsome
,
was
yet
rounded
in
its
proportions
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
heard
,
dear
Edith
,
that
your
father
has
consented
to
our
union
?
"
said
Auriol
,
after
gazing
at
her
for
a
few
moments
in
silent
admiration
.
 
<EOS>
Edith
murmured
an
affirmative
,
and
blushed
deeply
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
has
fixed
Wednesday
next
,
"
pursued
Auriol
;
"
but
I
wish
an
earlier
day
could
have
been
named
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
presentiment
that
if
our
marriage
is
so
long
delayed
,
it
will
not
take
place
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
full
of
misgivings
,
Auriol
,
"
she
replied
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
confess
it
,
"
he
said
;
"
and
my
apprehensions
have
risen
to
such
a
point
that
I
feel
disposed
to
urge
you
to
a
private
marriage
,
during
your
father
's
absence
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
no
,
Auriol
;
much
as
I
love
you
,
I
could
never
consent
to
such
a
step
,
"
she
cried
.
<EOS>
"
You
can
not
urge
me
to
it
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
abuse
my
dear
father
's
trusting
love
.
<EOS>
I
have
never
deceived
him
,
and
that
is
the
best
assurance
I
can
give
you
that
I
shall
never
deceive
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
Further
conversation
was
interrupted
by
the
entrance
of
Mr.
Talbot
,
who
held
out
both
his
hands
to
Auriol
,
and
professed
the
greatest
delight
to
see
him
.
<EOS>
And
no
doubt
he
was
sincere
.
<EOS>
The
dinner
passed
off
most
pleasantly
,
and
so
did
the
evening
;
for
the
old
gentleman
was
in
high
sprits
,
and
his
hilarity
was
communicated
to
the
young
couple
.
<EOS>
When
Auriol
and
Mr.
Talbot
went
upstairs
to
tea
,
they
found
that
Edith
's
aunt
,
Mrs.
Maitland
,
had
arrived
to
take
charge
of
her
during
her
father
's
absence
.
<EOS>
This
lady
had
always
exhibited
a
partiality
for
Auriol
,
and
had
encouraged
his
suit
to
her
niece
;
consequently
she
was
well
satisfied
with
the
turn
affairs
had
taken
.
<EOS>
It
was
near
midnight
before
Auriol
could
tear
himself
away
;
and
when
he
rose
to
depart
,
Mr.
Talbot
,
who
had
yawned
frequently
,
but
fruitlessly
,
to
give
him
a
hint
,
told
him
he
might
depend
upon
seeing
him
back
on
the
evening
of
the
third
day
,
and
in
the
meantime
he
committed
him
to
the
care
of
Mrs.
Maitland
and
Edith
.
 
<EOS>
Three
days
flew
by
rapidly
and
delightfully
;
and
on
the
evening
of
the
last
,
just
as
the
little
party
were
assembled
in
the
drawing
-
room
,
after
dinner
,
Mr.
Talbot
returned
from
his
journey
.
"
<EOS>
Well
,
here
I
am
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
,
clasping
Edith
to
his
bosom
,
"
without
having
encountered
any
misadventure
.
<EOS>
On
the
contrary
,
I
have
completed
my
business
to
my
entire
satisfaction
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
how
delighted
I
am
to
see
you
dear
papa
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Edith
.
"
<EOS>
Now
,
Auriol
,
you
can
have
no
more
apprehensions
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Apprehensions
of
what
?
"
cried
Mr.
Talbot
.
 
<EOS>
"
Of
some
accident
befalling
you
,
which
might
have
interfered
with
our
happiness
,
sir
,
"
replied
Auriol
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
lovers
are
full
of
idle
fears
!
"
cried
Mr.
Talbot
.
<EOS>
"
They
are
unreasonable
beings
.
<EOS>
However
,
here
I
am
,
as
I
said
before
,
safe
and
sound
.
<EOS>
Tomorrow
we
will
finish
all
preliminary
arrangements
,
and
the
day
after
you
shall
be
made
happy
--
ha
!
ha
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Do
you
know
,
papa
,
Auriol
intends
to
give
a
grand
ball
on
our
wedding
-
day
,
and
has
invited
all
his
acquaintance
to
it
?
"
remarked
Edith
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
have
not
invited
Cyprian
Rougemont
?
"
said
Mr.
Talbot
,
regarding
him
fixedly
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
,
sir
,
"
replied
Auriol
turning
pale
.
<EOS>
"
But
why
do
you
particularize
him
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Because
I
have
heard
some
things
of
him
not
much
to
his
credit
,
"
replied
Mr.
Talbot
.
<EOS>
"
What
--
what
have
you
heard
,
sir
?
"
demanded
Auriol
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
one
should
n't
believe
all
the
ill
one
hears
of
a
man
;
and
,
indeed
,
I
can
not
believe
all
I
have
heard
of
Cyprian
Rougemont
,
"
replied
Mr.
Talbot
;
"
but
I
should
be
glad
if
you
dropped
his
acquaintance
altogether
.
<EOS>
And
now
let
us
change
the
subject
.
"
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Talbot
seated
himself
besides
Mrs.
Maitland
,
and
began
to
give
her
some
account
of
his
journey
,
which
appeared
to
have
been
as
pleasant
as
it
had
been
rapid
.
 
<EOS>
Unable
to
shake
off
the
gloom
which
had
stolen
over
him
,
Auriol
took
his
leave
,
promising
to
meet
Mr.
Talbot
at
his
lawyer
's
in
Lincoln
's
Inn
,
at
noon
on
the
following
day
.
<EOS>
He
was
there
at
the
time
appointed
and
,
to
Mr.
Talbot
's
great
delight
,
and
the
no
small
surprise
of
the
lawyer
,
paid
over
a
hundred
thousand
pounds
,
to
be
settled
on
his
future
wife
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
a
perfect
man
of
honour
,
Auriol
,
"
said
Mr.
Talbot
,
clapping
him
on
the
shoulder
,
"
and
I
hope
Edith
will
make
you
an
excellent
wife
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
I
have
no
doubt
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Nor
I,--if
I
ever
possess
her
,
"
mentally
ejaculated
Auriol
.
 
<EOS>
The
morning
passed
in
other
preparations
.
<EOS>
In
the
evening
the
lovers
met
as
usual
,
and
separated
with
the
full
persuasion
,
on
Edith
's
part
at
least
,
that
the
next
day
would
make
them
happy
.
<EOS>
Since
the
night
of
the
compact
,
Auriol
had
neither
seen
Rougemont
,
nor
heard
from
him
,
and
he
neglected
no
precaution
to
prevent
his
intrusion
.

THE
SEVENTH
NIGHT
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
delicious
morning
,
in
May
,
and
the
sun
shone
brightly
on
Auriol
's
gorgeous
equipage
,
as
he
drove
to
St.
George
's
,
Hanover-
square
,
where
he
was
united
to
Edith
.
<EOS>
Thus
far
all
seemed
auspicious
,
and
he
thought
he
could
now
bid
defiance
to
fate
.
<EOS>
With
the
object
of
his
love
close
beside
him
,
and
linked
to
him
by
the
strongest
and
holiest
ties
,
it
seemed
impossible
she
could
be
snatched
from
him
.
<EOS>
Nothing
occurred
during
the
morning
to
give
him
uneasiness
,
and
he
gave
orders
that
a
carriage
and
four
should
be
ready
an
hour
before
midnight
,
to
convey
him
and
his
bride
to
Richmond
,
where
they
were
to
spend
their
honeymoon
.
 
<EOS>
Night
came
,
and
with
it
began
to
arrive
the
guests
who
were
bidden
to
the
ball
.
<EOS>
No
expense
had
been
spared
by
Auriol
to
give
splendour
to
his
fete
.
<EOS>
It
was
in
all
respects
magnificent
.
<EOS>
The
amusements
of
the
evening
commenced
with
a
concert
,
which
was
performed
by
the
first
singers
from
the
Italian
Opera
;
after
which
,
the
ball
was
opened
by
Auriol
and
his
lovely
bride
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
the
dance
was
over
,
Auriol
made
a
sign
to
an
attendant
who
instantly
disappeared
.
 
<EOS>
"
Are
you
prepared
to
quit
this
gay
scene
with
me
,
Edith
?
<EOS>
"
he
asked
,
with
a
heart
swelling
with
rapture
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Quite
so
,
"
she
replied
,
gazing
at
him
with
tenderness
;
"
I
long
to
be
alone
with
you
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Come
then
,
"
said
Auriol
.
 
<EOS>
Edith
arose
,
and
passing
her
arm
under
that
of
her
husband
,
they
quitted
the
ball
-
room
,
but
in
place
of
descending
the
principal
staircase
,
they
took
a
more
private
course
.
<EOS>
The
hall
,
which
they
were
obliged
to
cross
and
which
they
entered
from
a
side
-
door
,
was
spacious
and
beautifully
proportioned
,
and
adorned
with
numerous
statues
on
pedestals
.
<EOS>
The
ceiling
was
decorated
with
fresco
paintings
,
and
supported
by
two
stately
scagliola
pillars
.
<EOS>
From
between
these
,
a
broad
staircase
of
white
marble
ascended
to
the
upper
room
.
<EOS>
As
Auriol
had
foreseen
,
the
staircase
was
thronged
with
guests
ascending
to
the
ball
-
room
,
the
doors
of
which
being
open
,
afforded
glimpses
of
the
dancers
,
and
gave
forth
strains
of
liveliest
music
.
<EOS>
Anxious
to
avoid
a
newly
arrived
party
in
the
hall
,
Auriol
and
his
bride
lingered
for
a
moment
near
a
pillar
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ha
!
who
is
this
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Edith
,
as
a
tall
man
,
with
a
sinister
countenance
,
and
habited
entirely
in
black
moved
from
the
farther
side
of
the
pillar
,
and
planted
himself
in
their
path
,
with
his
back
partly
towards
them
.
 
<EOS>
A
thrill
of
apprehension
passed
through
Auriol
's
frame
.
<EOS>
He
looked
up
and
beheld
Rougemont
,
who
,
glancing
over
his
shoulder
fixed
his
malignant
gaze
upon
him
.
<EOS>
Retreat
was
now
impossible
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
thought
to
delude
me
,
"
said
Rougemont
,
in
a
deep
whisper
,
audible
only
to
Auriol
;
"
but
you
counted
without
your
host
.
<EOS>
I
am
come
to
claim
my
victim
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
is
the
matter
with
you
,
that
you
tremble
so
,
dear
Auriol
?
<EOS>
"
cried
Edith
.
<EOS>
"
Who
is
this
strange
person
?
"
 
<EOS>
But
her
husband
returned
no
answer
.
<EOS>
Terror
had
taken
away
his
power
of
utterance
.
 
<EOS>
"
Your
carriage
waits
for
you
at
the
door
,
madam
--
<EOS>
all
is
prepared
,
"
said
Rougemont
,
advancing
towards
her
,
and
taking
her
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
coming
,
Auriol
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Edith
,
who
scarcely
knew
whether
to
draw
back
or
go
forward
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
--
yes
,
"
cried
Auriol
,
who
fancied
he
saw
a
means
of
escape
.
<EOS>
"
This
is
my
friend
,
Mr.
Rougemont
--
go
with
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Rougemont
,
"
cried
Edith
.
<EOS>
"
You
told
my
father
he
would
not
be
here
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Your
husband
did
not
invite
me
,
madam
,
"
said
Rougemont
,
with
sarcastic
emphasis
;
"
but
knowing
I
should
be
welcome
,
I
came
unasked
.
<EOS>
But
let
us
avoid
those
persons
.
"
 
<EOS>
In
another
moment
they
were
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
The
carriage
was
there
with
its
four
horses
,
and
a
man
-
servant
,
in
travelling
attire
,
stood
beside
the
steps
.
<EOS>
Reassured
by
the
sight
,
Auriol
recovered
his
courage
,
and
suffered
Rougemont
to
throw
a
cloak
over
Edith
's
shoulders
.
<EOS>
The
next
moment
she
tripped
up
the
steps
of
the
carriage
,
and
was
ensconced
within
it
.
<EOS>
Auriol
was
about
to
follow
her
,
when
he
received
a
violent
blow
on
the
chest
,
which
stretched
him
on
the
pavement
.
<EOS>
Before
he
could
regain
his
feet
,
Rougemont
had
sprung
into
the
carriage
.
<EOS>
The
steps
were
instantly
put
up
by
the
man
-
servant
,
who
mounted
the
box
with
the
utmost
celerity
,
while
the
postilions
,
plunging
spurs
into
their
horses
,
dashed
off
with
lightning
speed
.
<EOS>
As
the
carriage
turned
the
corner
of
King
-
street
,
Auriol
,
who
had
just
arisen
,
beheld
,
by
the
light
of
a
lamp
,
Rougemont
's
face
at
the
window
of
the
carriage
,
charged
with
an
expression
of
the
most
fiendish
triumph
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
is
the
matter
?
"
cried
Mr.
Talbot
,
who
had
approached
Auriol
.
<EOS>
"
I
came
to
bid
you
good
-
bye
.
<EOS>
Why
do
I
find
you
here
alone
?
<EOS>
Where
is
the
carriage?--what
has
become
of
Edith
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
She
is
in
the
power
of
the
Fiend
,
and
I
have
sold
her
to
him
,
"
replied
Auriol
,
gloomily
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
mean
you
,
wretch
?
"
cried
Mr.
Talbot
,
in
a
voice
of
distraction
.
<EOS>
"
I
heard
that
Cyprian
Rougemont
was
here
.
<EOS>
Can
it
be
he
that
has
gone
off
with
her
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
hit
the
truth
,
"
replied
Auriol
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
bought
her
with
the
money
I
gave
you
.
<EOS>
I
have
sold
her
and
myself
to
perdition
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Horror
!
"
exclaimed
the
old
man
,
falling
backwards
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
breathe
your
last
<EOS>
--
breathe
your
last
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Auriol
,
wildly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Would
I
could
yield
up
my
life
,
likewise
!
"
 
<EOS>
And
he
hurried
away
,
utterly
unconscious
whither
<EOS>
he
went
.

BOOK
<EOS>
THE
SECOND
--
CYPRIAN
DE
ROUGEMONT
   
I.
<EOS>
THE
CELL
 
Mr.
Thorneycroft
and
his
companions
had
scarcely
gained
a
passage
in
the
deserted
house
,
which
they
had
entered
in
the
manner
described
in
a
previous
chapter
,
when
they
were
alarmed
by
the
sudden
and
furious
ringing
of
a
bell
overhead
.
<EOS>
The
noise
brought
them
instantly
to
a
halt
,
and
each
man
grasped
his
arms
in
expectation
of
an
attack
,
but
the
peal
ceasing
in
a
few
moments
,
and
all
continuing
quiet
,
they
moved
on
as
before
,
and
presently
reached
a
large
hall
with
a
lofty
window
over
the
door
,
which
,
being
without
shutters
,
afforded
light
enough
to
reveal
the
dilapidated
condition
of
the
mansion
.
 
<EOS>
From
this
hall
four
side
doors
opened
,
apparently
communicating
with
different
chambers
,
three
of
which
were
cautiously
tried
by
Reeks
,
but
they
proved
to
be
fastened
.
<EOS>
The
fourth
,
however
,
yielded
to
his
touch
,
and
admitted
them
to
a
chamber
,
which
seemed
to
have
been
recently
occupied
,
for
a
lamp
was
burning
within
it
.
<EOS>
The
walls
were
pannelled
with
dusty
oak
,
and
hung
at
the
lower
end
with
tapestry
,
representing
the
Assyrian
monarch
Ninus
,
and
his
captive
Zoroaster
,
King
of
the
Bactrians
.
<EOS>
The
chief
furniture
consisted
of
three
large
high
-
backed
and
grotesquely
carved
arm
-
chairs
,
near
one
of
which
stood
a
powerful
electrical
machine
.
<EOS>
Squares
and
circles
were
traced
upon
the
floor
,
and
here
and
there
were
scattered
cups
and
balls
,
and
other
matters
apparently
belonging
to
a
conjuring
apparatus
.
 
<EOS>
The
room
might
be
the
retreat
of
a
man
of
science
,
or
it
might
be
the
repository
of
a
juggler
.
<EOS>
But
whoever
its
occupant
was
,
and
whatsoever
his
pursuits
,
the
good
things
of
the
world
were
not
altogether
neglected
by
him
,
as
was
proved
by
a
table
spread
with
viands
,
and
furnished
with
glasses
,
together
with
a
couple
of
taper
-
necked
bottles
.
 
<EOS>
While
glancing
upwards
,
Mr.
Thorneycroft
remarked
that
just
above
each
chair
the
ceiling
was
pierced
with
a
round
hole
,
the
meaning
of
which
he
could
not
at
the
time
comprehend
,
though
after
circumstances
sufficiently
explained
it
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
singular
room
,
"
he
observed
to
Reeks
,
on
concluding
his
survey
.
<EOS>
"
Did
you
expect
to
find
anyone
here
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
hardly
know
,
"
replied
the
other
.
<EOS>
"
That
bell
may
have
given
the
alarm
.
<EOS>
But
I
will
soon
ascertain
the
point
.
<EOS>
Remain
here
till
I
return
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
not
going
to
leave
us
?
<EOS>
"
rejoined
Mr.
Thorneycroft
,
uneasily
.
 
<EOS>
"
Only
for
a
moment
,
"
said
Reeks
.
<EOS>
"
Keep
quiet
,
and
no
harm
will
befall
you
.
<EOS>
Whatever
you
may
hear
without
,
do
not
stir
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
are
we
likely
to
hear
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Thorneycroft
,
with
increasing
trepidation
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
impossible
to
say
,
"
answered
Reeks
;
"
but
I
warn
you
not
to
cry
out
unnecessarily
,
as
such
an
imprudence
would
endanger
our
safety
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
quite
sure
you
do
n't
mean
to
abandon
us
?
"
<EOS>
persisted
Thorneycroft
.
 
<EOS>
"
Make
yourself
easy
;
I
have
no
such
intention
,
"
rejoined
Reeks
,
sternly
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
ve'll
take
care
of
you
,
do
n't
be
afeerd
,
old
gent
,
"
said
Ginger
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
ve'll
take
care
on
you
,
"
added
the
Tinker
and
the
Sandman
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
may
depend
upon
them
as
upon
me
,
sir
,
"
said
Reeks
.
<EOS>
"
Before
we
explore
the
subterranean
apartments
,
I
wish
to
see
whether
anyone
is
upstairs
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Wot
's
that
you
say
about
subterranean
apartments
,
Mr.
Reeks
?
"
interposed
Ginger
.
"
<EOS>
Ye
ai
n't
a
-
goin
'
below
,
eh
?
"
 
<EOS>
But
without
paying
any
attention
to
the
inquiry
,
Reeks
quitted
the
room
,
and
closed
the
door
carefully
after
him
.
<EOS>
He
next
crossed
the
hall
,
and
cautiously
ascending
a
staircase
at
the
farther
end
of
it
,
reached
the
landing
-
place
.
<EOS>
Beyond
it
was
a
gallery
,
from
which
several
chambers
opened
.
 
<EOS>
Advancing
a
few
paces
,
he
listened
intently
,
and
hearing
a
slight
sound
in
an
apartment
to
the
right
,
he
stepped
softly
towards
it
,
and
placing
his
eye
to
the
keyhole
,
beheld
a
tall
man
,
dressed
in
black
pacing
to
and
fro
with
rapid
strides
,
while
three
other
persons
,
wrapped
in
sable
gowns
,
and
disguised
with
hideous
masks
,
stood
silent
and
motionless
at
a
little
distance
from
him
.
<EOS>
In
the
tall
man
he
recognised
Cyprian
Rougemont
.
<EOS>
Upon
a
table
in
the
middle
of
the
room
was
laid
a
large
open
volume
,
bound
in
black
vellum
.
<EOS>
Near
it
stood
a
lamp
,
which
served
to
illumine
the
scene
.
 
<EOS>
Suddenly
,
Rougemont
stopped
,
and
turning
over
several
leaves
of
the
book
,
which
were
covered
with
cabalistic
characters
,
appeared
in
search
of
some
magic
formula
.
<EOS>
Before
he
could
find
it
,
however
,
a
startling
interruption
occurred
.
<EOS>
An
alarum
-
bell
,
fixed
against
the
wall
,
began
to
ring
,
and
at
the
same
moment
the
doors
of
a
cabinet
flew
open
,
and
a
large
ape
(
for
such
it
seemed
to
Reeks
)
,
clothed
in
a
woollen
shirt
and
drawers
,
sprang
forth
,
and
bounding
upon
the
table
beside
Rougemont
,
placed
its
mouth
to
his
ear
.
<EOS>
The
communication
thus
strangely
made
seemed
highly
displeasing
to
Rougemont
,
who
knitted
his
brows
,
and
delivered
some
instructions
in
an
under
tone
to
the
monkey
.
<EOS>
The
animal
nodded
its
head
in
token
of
obedience
,
jumped
off
the
table
,
and
bounded
back
to
the
cabinet
,
the
doors
of
which
closed
as
before
.
<EOS>
Rougemont
next
took
up
the
lamp
,
with
the
evident
intention
of
quitting
the
room
,
seeing
which
,
Reeks
hastily
retreated
to
an
adjoining
chamber
,
the
door
of
which
was
fortunately
open
,
and
had
scarcely
gained
its
shelter
when
the
four
mysterious
personages
appeared
on
the
gallery
.
<EOS>
Reeks
heard
their
footsteps
descending
the
staircase
,
and
then
,
creeping
cautiously
after
them
,
watched
them
across
the
hall
,
and
pause
before
the
chamber
containing
Mr.
Thorneycroft
and
his
companions
.
<EOS>
After
a
moment
's
deliberation
,
Rougemont
noiselessly
locked
the
door
,
took
out
the
key
,
and
leaving
two
of
his
attendants
on
guard
,
returned
with
the
third
towards
the
staircase
.
 
<EOS>
Without
tarrying
to
confront
them
,
Reeks
started
back
,
and
hurried
along
the
gallery
till
he
came
to
a
back
staircase
,
which
conducted
him
,
by
various
descents
,
to
the
basement
floor
,
where
,
after
traversing
one
or
two
vaults
,
he
entered
a
subterranean
passage
,
arched
overhead
,
and
having
several
openings
at
the
sides
,
apparently
communicating
with
other
passages
.
<EOS>
It
was
lighted
at
intervals
by
lamps
,
which
emitted
a
feeble
radiance
.
 
<EOS>
By
the
light
of
one
of
these
,
Reeks
discovered
the
door
of
a
cell
.
<EOS>
It
was
of
iron
,
and
as
he
struck
it
with
his
hand
,
returned
a
hollow
clangour
.
<EOS>
On
repeating
the
blow
,
a
hoarse
voice
from
within
cried
,
"
Leave
me
in
peace
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Is
it
Auriol
Darcy
who
speaks
?
"
demanded
Reeks
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
,
"
replied
the
prisoner
.
<EOS>
"
Who
are
you
that
put
the
question
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
A
friend
,
"
replied
Reeks
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
friend
here
,
"
said
Auriol
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
mistaken
,
"
rejoined
Reeks
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
come
with
Mr.
Thorneycroft
to
deliver
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Thorneycroft
has
come
too
late
.
<EOS>
He
has
lost
his
daughter
,
"
replied
Auriol
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
has
happened
to
her
?
"
demanded
Reeks
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
is
in
the
power
of
the
Fiend
,
"
replied
Auriol
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
she
is
detained
by
Cyprian
Rougemont
,
"
said
Reeks
.
<EOS>
"
But
what
has
befallen
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
She
has
become
like
his
other
victims
--
like
my
victims
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Auriol
,
distractedly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
not
despair
,
"
rejoined
Reeks
.
<EOS>
"
She
may
yet
be
saved
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Saved
!
<EOS>
how
?
"
cried
Auriol
.
<EOS>
"
All
is
over
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
So
it
may
seem
to
you
,
"
rejoined
Reeks
;
"
but
you
are
the
victim
of
delusion
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
that
I
could
think
so
!
"
exclaimed
Auriol
.
<EOS>
"
But
no
--
I
saw
her
fall
into
the
pit
.
<EOS>
I
beheld
her
veiled
figure
rise
from
it
.
<EOS>
I
witnessed
her
signature
to
the
fatal
scroll
.
<EOS>
There
could
be
no
illusion
in
what
I
then
beheld
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Despite
all
this
,
you
will
see
her
again
,
"
said
Reeks
.
 
<EOS>
"
Who
are
you
who
give
me
this
promise
?
"
asked
Auriol
.
 
<EOS>
"
As
I
have
already
declared
,
a
friend
,
"
replied
Reeks
.
 
<EOS>
"
Are
you
human
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
As
yourself
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
you
seek
in
vain
to
struggle
with
the
powers
of
darkness
,
"
said
Auriol
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
fear
of
Cyprian
Rougemont
,
"
rejoined
Reeks
,
with
a
laugh
.
 
<EOS>
"
Your
voice
seems
familiar
to
me
,
"
said
Auriol
.
<EOS>
"
Tell
me
who
you
are
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
shall
know
anon
,
"
replied
Reeks
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
,
hist!--we
are
interrupted
.
<EOS>
Someone
approaches

THE
ENCHANTED
CHAIRS
 
<EOS>
More
than
ten
minutes
had
elapsed
since
Reek
's
departure
,
and
Mr.
Thorneycroft
,
who
had
hitherto
had
some
difficulty
in
repressing
his
anger
,
now
began
to
give
vent
to
it
in
muttered
threats
and
complaints
.
<EOS>
His
impatience
was
shared
by
the
Tinker
,
who
,
stepping
up
to
Ginger
,
said--"Wot
<EOS>
the
devil
can
Mr.
Reeks
be
about
?
<EOS>
I
hope
nuffin
'
has
happened
to
him
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
mention
a
certain
gent
's
name
here
,
"
remarked
Ginger
;
"
or
if
you
do
,
treat
it
vith
proper
respect
.
"
 
"
Pshaw
!
"
exclaimed
the
Tinker
,
impatiently
;
"
I
do
n't
like
a
man
stayin
'
avay
in
this
manner
.
<EOS>
It
looks
suspicious
.
<EOS>
I
wotes
ve
goes
and
sees
arter
him
.
<EOS>
Ve
can
leave
the
old
gent
to
take
a
keviet
nap
by
himself
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
disturb
yourself
,
sir
.
<EOS>
Ve'll
only
jist
giv
'
a
look
about
us
,
and
then
come
back
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Stay
where
you
are
,
rascal
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Thorneycroft
,
angrily
.
<EOS>
"
I
wo
n't
be
left
.
<EOS>
Stay
where
you
are
,
I
command
you
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Vell
,
ve've
got
a
noo
captain
,
I
'm
a
-
thinkin

,
"
said
the
Tinker
,
winking
at
the
others
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ve've
no
vish
to
disobleege
you
,
sir
.
<EOS>
I
'll
only
jist
peep
out
into
the
hall
,
and
see
if
Mr.
Reeks
is
anyvhere
thereabouts
.
<EOS>
Vy
,
zounds
!
"
<EOS>
he
added
,
as
he
tried
the
door
,
"
it
's
locked
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
's
locked
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Thorneycroft
,
in
dismay
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
door
,
to
be
sure
,
"
replied
the
Tinker
.
"
<EOS>
Ve're
prisoners
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
Lord
,
you
do
n't
say
so
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
iron
-
merchant
,
in
an
agony
of
fright
.
<EOS>
"
What
will
become
of
us
?
"
 
<EOS>
A
roar
of
laughter
from
the
others
converted
his
terror
into
fury
 
<EOS>
"
I
see
how
it
is
,
"
he
cried
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
entrapped
me
,
ruffians
.
<EOS>
It
's
all
a
trick
.
<EOS>
You
mean
to
murder
me
.
<EOS>
But
I
'll
sell
my
life
dearly
.
<EOS>
The
first
one
who
approaches
shall
have
his
brains
blown
out
.
"
<EOS>
And
as
he
spoke
,
he
levelled
a
pistol
at
the
Tinker
's
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
Holloa
!
<EOS>
wot
are
you
arter
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
cried
the
individual
,
sheltering
his
head
with
his
hands
.
<EOS>
"
You
're
a
labourin
'
under
a
mistake
--
a
complete
mistake

<EOS>
If
it

ve're
catched
in
it
as
vall
as
yourself

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
To
be

"
added
the
Sandman
.
<EOS>
"
Sit
down
,
and
vait
a
bit
.
<EOS>
I
dessay
Mr.
Reeks'll

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
well
,
I
must
resign
myself
,
I
suppose
,
"
groaned
Thorneycroft
,
sinking
into
a
chair
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
terrible
situation
to
be
placed
in
--
shut
up
in
a
haunted
house
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
've
been
in
many
much
vurser
sitivations

"
observed
Ginger
,
"
and
<EOS>
I
alvays
found
the
best
vay
to
get
out
on
'em
wos
to
take
things
quietly
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Besides
,
there
's
no
help
for
it
,
"
said
the
Tinker
,
seating
himself
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
remains
to
be
seen
,
"
observed
the
Sandman
,
taking
the
chair
opposite
Thorneycroft
.
<EOS>
"
If
Reeks
do
n't
come
back
soon
,
I
'll
bust
open
the
door
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Plenty
o
'
time
for
that
,
"
said
Ginger
,
sauntering
towards
the
table
on
which
the
provisions
were
spread
;
"
wot
do
you
say
to
a
mouthful
o
'
wittles
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
would
n't
touch
'em
for
the
world
,
"
replied
the
Sandman
.
 
<EOS>
"
Nor
I
,
"
added
the
Tinker
;
"
they
may
be
pisoned
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Pisoned
--
nonsense
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Ginger
;
"
do
n't
you

some
von

<EOS>
takin

Vith

the

<EOS>
"
Do

cried
Mr.
Thorneycroft
.
<EOS>
"
I
agree
with
your
companions

it
may
be
poisoned

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
I

"
cried
Ginger
,
helping
himself
to
a
dish
before
him
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
good

pigeon
-
pie
as
ever
I

<EOS>
Your

Mr.
Thorneycroft

he
added
,
filling
a
goblet
from
one
of
the
bottles
.
<EOS>
"
My
service

gents

<EOS>
Famous
tipple

"
<EOS>
drawing
a
long
breath
after
the
draught
,
and
smacking
his
lips
with
amazing
satisfaction
.
"
<EOS>
Never
tasted
sich
<EOS>
a
glass
o
'
<EOS>
wine
in
all
my

days

"
he
continued
,
replenishing
the
goblet
:
"
I
wonder
wot
it
's
called
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Prussic
acid
,
"
replied
Mr.
Thorneycroft
,
gruffly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Proossic
fiddlesticks
,
"
cried
Ginger
;
"
more
likely
Tokay
.
<EOS>
I
shall
finish
the
bottle
,
and
never

vorse
for

<EOS>
"
He
's
gettin

the

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I

it

Tokay

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
No

cried
Thorneycroft
;
"
let
him
alone
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
must
taste
it
,
"
said
the
Tinker
,
unable
to
resist
the
temptation
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Here
,
give
us
a
glass
,
Ginger
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Vith
pleasure

"
replied
Ginger
,
filling
a
goblet
to
the
brim
,
and
handing
it
to
him
.
<EOS>
"
You
'd
better
be
perwailed
upon

Sandy

"
 
<EOS>
"
Vell
,
I
s'pose
<EOS>
I
must
,
"
replied
the
Sandman
,
taking
the
goblet
proffered
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Here
's
the
beak
's
healths
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Ginger
.
<EOS>
"
I
gives
that
toast
'cos
<EOS>
they
're
alvays
so
kind
to
us
dog
-
fanciers

"
 
<EOS>
"
Dog
-
fanciers

say
,
rather
,
dog
-
stealers
;
for
that
's
the
name
such
vagabonds
deserve
to
be
known
by

"
said
Mr.
Thorneycroft
,
with
some
asperity
.
 
<EOS>
"
Vell
,
ve
von't
quarrel
about
names
,
"
replied
Ginger
,
laughing
,
"
but
I
'll
relate
a
circumstance
to
you
<EOS>
as'll
prove
that
wotever
your
opinion

may
be

the

upholds
it

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
There
can
be
but
one
opinion
as
to
your
nefarious
profession
,
"
said
Mr.
Thorneycroft
,
"
and
that
is
,
that
it
's
as
bad
as
horse
-
stealing
and
sheep
-
stealing
,
and
should
be
punished
as
those
offences
are
punished
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
So
I
think
,
sir
,
"
said
Ginger
,
winking
at
the
others
;
"
but
to
my
story
,
and
do
n't
interrupt
me
,
or
I
ca
n't
get
through
vith
it
properly
.
<EOS>
There
's
a
gent
livin
'
not
a
hundred
miles
from
Pall
-
Mall
,
as
the
noospapers
says
,
as
had
a
favourite
Scotch
terrier
,
not
worth
more
nor
half
-
a
-
crown
to
any
one
but
hisself
,
but
highly
wallerable
to
him
,
'cos
<EOS>
it
wos
a
favourite
.
<EOS>
Vell
,
the
dog
is
lost
.
<EOS>
A
pal
of
mine
gets
hold
on
it
,
and
the
gent
soon
offers
a
reward
for
its
recovery
.
<EOS>
This
do
n't
bring
it
back
quite
so
soon
as
he
expects
,
'cos
he
do
n't
offer
enough
;
so
he
goes
to
an
agent
,
Mr.
Simpkins
,
in
the
Edger
-
road
,
and
Mr.
Simpkins
says
to
him
--
says
he
,
'
How
are
you
,
sir
?
<EOS>
I
expected
you
some
days
ago

<EOS>
You
've
com'd
about
that
ere
Scotch
terrier

<EOS>
You
've
got
a
wallable
greyhound

I
understand

<EOS>
A
man
told
me
he
'd
have
that
afore

<EOS>
Seein

Mr.

'
Vel

I
'll
tell
you
wot
you
must
give
for

<EOS>
The
party
von't
take
less
than
six
guineas
.
<EOS>
He
knows
it
ai
n't
vorth
six
shillin
'
,
but
it
's
a
great
favourite
,
and
has
given
him
a
precious

gettin

it

<EOS>
Give
him
trouble

'
<EOS>
cries
the
gent

<EOS>
angrily--'and
what
has
it
given
me
?
<EOS>
I
hope
to
see
the
rascal
hanged
!
<EOS>
I
shall
pay
no
such
money

'
<EOS>
'
<EOS>
Werry
vell
,
'
replies
Mr.
Simpkins
,
coolly
,
'
then
your
dog'll
be
bled
to
death
,
as
the
nobleman
's
wos

and
thrown
down
a
breathless
carkis
afore
your

'
 
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
mean
to
say
that
such
a
horrid
circumstance
as
that
really
took
place
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Thorneycroft
,
who
was
much
interested
in
the
relation
.
 
<EOS>
"
Only
t'other
day
,
I
assure
you
,
"
replied
Ginger
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'd
shoot
the
ruffian
who
treated
a
dog
of
mine
<EOS>
so
,
if
I
caught
him
!
"
cried
Mr.
Thorneycroft
,
indignantly
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
sarve
him
right

too

"
said
Ginger

<EOS>
"
I
discourages
all
cruelty

<EOS>
But
do
n't

me
again

<EOS>
Arter
a
bit
more
chafferin
'
vith
Mr.
Simphins
<EOS>
,
the
gent
offers
three
pound
for
his
dog
,
and
then
goes
avay
;
Next
day
he
reads
a
report

i

the
Times

that
a

up

dogs
is
shut
up
in
the
green

yard
behind
the
police

office
in
Bow

street
<EOS>
So
he
goes
there
in
search
o

<EOS>
his
favourite
,
and
sure
enough
he
finds
it
,
but
the
inspector
von't
give
it
up

<EOS>
"
Shameful

cried
Mr.

<EOS>
"
Shameful

Ginger

Thinkin

The

<EOS>

Under

cried
Thorneycroft
.
 
<EOS>
"
Under
their
werry
noses
,
"
replied
Ginger
.
<EOS>
"
But
now
comes
the
cream
o
'
the
jest

<EOS>
You
shall
hear
wot
the
beak
says
to
him

the

craves
his

<EOS>
'
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
interfere
in

says
he
,
a

bendin
'
of
his
brows
in
a
majestic
manner
.

<EOS>
Parties

vith
complaints
of
vhich
I
ca
n't
take

<EOS>
This
place
ai

an

office

and
I
sha
n't
suffer
it
to
be
made
von

<EOS>
I
von't
listen

'
<EOS>
Statements
affectin
'
our

you
tvig
that
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
,
indeed
,
"
said
Thorneycroft
,
sighing
;
"
and
I
am
sorry
to
think
such
a
remark
should
have
dropped
from
the
bench
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
're
right
to
say
it
dropped
from
it
,
sir
,
"
laughed
Ginger
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
told
you
the
beaks
vos
our
best
friends
;
they
alvays
takes
our
parts
.
<EOS>
Ven
the
gent
urges
that
it
was
a
subject
of
ser'ous
importance
to
dog
-
owners
,
the
magistrit
angrily
interrupts
him
<EOS>
,
sayin'--'Then
let
there
be
a
meetin
'
of
dog
-
owners
to
discuss
their
grievances
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
come
to
me

<EOS>
I
ca
n't
help
you

'
<EOS>
And
he
vouldn't
<EOS>
if
he
could
,
'cos
<EOS>
he
's
the
dog
-
fancier
's
friend
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
looks
like
it
,
I
must
own
,
"
replied
Thorneycroft
.
<EOS>
"
Such
reprehensible
indifference
gives
encouragement
to
people
of
your
profession
.
<EOS>
Government
itself
is
to
blame
.
<EOS>
As
all
persons
who
keep
dogs
pay
a
tax
for
them
,
their
property
ought
to
be
protected
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
'm
quite
satisfied
vith
<EOS>
the
present
state
of
the
law
,
"
said
Ginger
;
"
here
's
the
vorthy
beak
!
<EOS>
I
'll
drink
his
health
for
a
second
time
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Halloa
!
<EOS>
wot
's
that
?
<EOS>
"
cried
the
Tinker
;
"
I
thought
I
heerd
a
noise
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
So
did
I
,
"
rejoined
the
Sandman
;
"
<EOS>
a
strange
sort
o
'
rumblin
'
sound
overhead
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
There
it
goes
again
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Ginger
;
"
wot
an
awful
din
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Now
it
's
underneath
,
"
said
Mr.
Thorneycroft
,
turning
pale
,
and
trembling
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
It
sounds
as
if
some
hidden
machinery
were
at
work
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
noise
,
which
up
to
this
moment
had
borne
an
indistinct
resemblance
to
the
creaking
of
wheels
and
pulleys
,
now
increased
to
a
violent
clatter
,
while
the
house
was
shaken
as
if
by
the
explosion
of
a
mine
beneath
it
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
,
the
occupants
of
the
chairs
received
a
sharp
electrical
shock
,
that
agitated
every
limb
,
and
caused
Mr.
Thorneycroft
to
let
fall
his
pistol
,
which
went
off
as
it
reached
the
ground
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
,
the
Sandman
dropped
his
goblet
,
and
the
Tinker
relinquished
his
grasp
of
the
cutlass
.
<EOS>
Before
they
could
recover
from
the
shock
,
all
three
were
caught
by
stout
wooden
hooks
,
which
,
detaching
themselves
from
the
back
of
the
chairs
,
pinioned
their
arms
,
while
their
legs
were
restrained
by
fetters
,
which
sprang
from
the
ground
and
clasped
round
their
ankles
.
<EOS>
Thus
fixed
,
they
struggled
vainly
to
get
free
.
<EOS>
The
chairs
seemed
nailed
to
the
ground
,
so
that
all
efforts
to
move
them
proved
futile
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
worst
was
to
come
.
<EOS>
From
the
holes
in
the
ceiling
already
alluded
to
,
descended
three
heavy
bell
-
shaped
helmets
,
fashioned
like
those
worn
by
divers
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
,
and
having
round
eyelet
-
holes
of
glass
.
<EOS>
It
was
evident
,
from
the
manner
of
their
descent
,
that
these
helmets
must
drop
on
the
heads
of
the
sitters
--
a
conviction
that
filled
them
with
inexpressible
terror
.
<EOS>
They
shouted
,
and
swore
frightfully
;
but
their
vociferations
availed
them
nothing
.
<EOS>
Down
came
the
helmets
,
and
the
same
moment
the
monkey
which
had
been
seen
by
Reeks
issued
from
a
cupboard
at
the
top
of
a
cabinet
,
and
grinned
and
gibbered
at
them
.
 
<EOS>
Down
came
the
first
helmet
,
and
covered
the
Tinker
to
the
shoulders
.
<EOS>
His
appearance
was
at
once
ludicrous
and
terrible
,
and
his
roaring
within
the
casque
sounded
like
the
bellowing
of
a
baited
bull
.
 
<EOS>
Down
came
the
second
helmet
,
though
rather
more
slowly
,
and
the
Sandman
was
eclipsed
in
the
same
manner
as
the
Tinker
,
and
roared
as
loudly
.
 
<EOS>
In
both
these
instances
the
helmets
had
dropped
without
guidance
,
but
in
the
case
of
Mr.
Thorneycroft
,
a
hand
,
thrust
out
of
the
hole
in
the
ceiling
,
held
the
helmet
suspended
over
his
head
,
like
the
sword
of
Damocles
.
<EOS>
While
the
poor
iron
-
merchant
momentarily
expected
the
same
doom
as
his
companions
,
his
attention
was
attracted
towards
the
monkey
,
which
,
clinging
with
one
hand
to
the
side
of
the
cabinet
,
extended
the
other
skinny
arm
towards
him
,
and
exclaimed--"Will
you
swear
to
go
hence
if
you
are
spared
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
will
not
,
"
replied
the
iron
-
merchant
.
<EOS>
He
had
scarcely
spoken
,
when
the
helmet
fell
with
a
jerk
,
and
extinguished
him
like
the
others
.
 
<EOS>
Ginger
alone
remained
.
<EOS>
During
the
whole
of
this
strange
scene
,
he
had
stood
with
the
bottle
in
hand
,
transfixed
with
terror
and
astonishment
,
and
wholly
unable
to
move
or
cry
out
.
<EOS>
A
climax
was
put
to
his
fright
,
by
the
descent
of
the
three
chairs
,
with
their
occupants
,
through
the
floor
into
a
vault
beneath
;
and
as
the
helmets
were
whisked
up
again
to
the
ceiling
,
and
the
trap
-
doors
closed
upon
the
chairs
,
he
dropped
the
bottle
,
and
fell
with
his
face
upon
the
table
.
<EOS>
He
was
,
however
,
soon
roused
by
a
pull
at
his
hair
,
while
a
shrill
voice
called
him
by
his
name
.
 
<EOS>
"
Who
is
it
?
<EOS>
"
groaned
the
dog
-
fancier
.
 
<EOS>
"
Look
up
!
"
cried
the
speaker
,
again
plucking
his
hair
.
 
<EOS>
Ginger
complied
,
and
beheld
the
monkey
seated
beside
him
.
"
<EOS>
Vy
,
it
ca
n't
be
,
surely
,
"
he
cried
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
yet
I
could
almost
svear
it
was
Old
Parr
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
're
near
the
mark
,
"
replied
the
other
,
with
a
shrill
laugh
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
your
venerable
friend
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Vot
the
deuce
are
you
doing
here
,
and
in
this
dress
,
or
rayther
undress
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Ginger
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ven
<EOS>
I
see
you
this
mornin
'
,
you
wos
in
the
serwixe
of
Mr.
Loftus
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
've
got
a
new
master
since
then
,
"
replied
the
dwarf
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'm
sorry
to
hear
it
,
"
said
Ginger
,
shaking
his
head
.
<EOS>
"
You
hav'n't
sold
yourself
,
like
Doctor
Forster---
"
 
"
Faustus
,
my
dear
Ginger
--
not
Forster
,
"
corrected
Old
Parr
.
"
<EOS>
No
,
no
,
I
've
made
a
bargain
.
<EOS>
And
to
be
plain
with
you
,
I
've
no
desire
to
remain
long
in
my
present
master
's
service
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
like
to
ask
the
question
too
directly
,
wenerable
,
"
said
<EOS>
Ginger
,
in
a
deprecatory
tone--"but
is
your
master
--
hem!--is
he--
hem!--the
--
<EOS>
the---
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
devil
,
you
would
say
,
"
supplied
Old
Parr
.
"
<EOS>
Between
ourselves
,
I
'm
afraid
there
's
no
denying
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
La
!
wot
a
horrible
idea
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Ginger
with
a
shudder
;
"
it
makes
the
flesh
creep
on
one
's
bones
.
<EOS>
Then
we
're
in
your
master
's
power
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Very
like
it
,
"
replied
Old
Parr
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
there
ai
n't
no
chance
o
'
deliverance
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
None
that
occurs
to
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
Lord
!
<EOS>
oh
Lord
!
"
groaned
Ginger
;
"
I
'll
repent
.
<EOS>
I
'll
become
a
reformed
character
.
<EOS>
I
'll
never
steal
dogs
no
more
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
In
that
case
,
there
may
be
some
chance
for
you
,
"
said
Old
Parr
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
could
help
you
to
escape
.
<EOS>
Come
with
me
,
and
I
'll
try
and
get
you
out
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
wot
is
to
become
of
the
others
?
"
demanded
Ginger
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
leave
them
to
their
fate
,
"
replied
Old
Parr
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
that
'll
never
do
,
"
cried
Ginger
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ve're
all
in
the
same
boat
,
and
must
row
out
together
the
best
vay
ve
can
.
<EOS>
I
tell
you
wot
<EOS>
it
is
,
wenerable
,
"
he
added
,
seizing
him
by
the
throat--"your
master
may
be
the
devil
,
but
you
're
mortal
;
and
if
you
do
n't
help
me
to
deliver
my
companions
,
I
'll
squeege
your
windpipe
for
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
not
the
way
to
induce
me
to
help
you
,
"
said
Old
Parr
,
twisting
himself
like
an
eel
out
of
the
other
's
grip
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Now
get
out
,
if
you
can
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
be
angry
,
"
cried
Ginger
,
seeing
the
mistake
he
had
committed
,
and
trying
to
conciliate
him
;
"
I
only
meant
to
frighten
you
a
bit
.
<EOS>
Can
you
tell
me
if
Mr.
Auriol
Darcy
is
here
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
he
is
,
and
a
close
prisoner
,
"
replied
Old
Parr
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
the
girl
--
Miss
Ebber
,
wot
of
her
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
say
,
"
rejoined
Old
Parr
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
only
speak
to
the
living
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
she
's
dead
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Ginger
,
with
a
look
of
horror
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
a
secret
,
"
replied
the
dwarf
,
mysteriously
;
"
and
I
'm
bound
by
a
terrible
oath
not
to
disclose
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
'll
have
it
out
of
you
notvithstandin
'
,
"
muttered
Ginger
.
<EOS>
"
I
vish
you
would
lend
me
a
knock
on
the
head
,
old
feller
.
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
help
thinkin
'
I
've
got
a
terrible
fit
o
'
the
nightmare
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Let
this
waken
you
,
then
,
"
said
Old
Parr
,
giving
him
a
sound
buffet
on
the
ear
.
 
<EOS>
"
Holloa
,
wenerable
!
<EOS>
not
so
hard
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Ginger
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ha
!
ha
!
ha
!
"
screamed
the
dwarf
.
<EOS>
"
You
know
what
you
're
about
now
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Not
exactly
,
"
said
Ginger
.
<EOS>
"
I
vish
I
wos
fairly
out
<EOS>
o
'
this
cursed
place
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
should
n't
have
ventured
into
the
lion
's
den
,
"
said
Old
Parr
,
in
a
taunting
tone
.
<EOS>
"
But
come
with
me
,
and
perhaps
I
may
be
able
to
do
something
towards
your
liberation
.
"
 
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
drew
aside
the
tapestry
,
and
opened
a
panel
behind
it
,
through
which
he
passed
,
and
beckoned
Ginger
to
follow
him
.
<EOS>
Taking
a
pistol
from
his
pocket
,
the
latter
complied

GERRARD
PASTON
 
Before
the
chair
,
in
which
Mr.
Thorneycroft
was
fixed
,
reached
the
ground
terror
had
taken
away
his
senses
.
<EOS>
A
bottle
of
salts
,
placed
to
his
nose
,
revived
him
after
a
time
;
but
he
had
nearly
relapsed
into
insensibility
on
seeing
two
strange
figures
,
in
hideous
masks
and
sable
cloaks
,
standing
on
either
side
of
him
,
while
at
a
little
distance
was
a
third
,
who
carried
a
strangely
fashioned
lantern
.
<EOS>
He
looked
round
for
his
companions
in
misfortune
,
but
,
though
the
chairs
were
there
,
they
were
unoccupied
.
 
<EOS>
The
masked
attendants
paid
no
attention
to
the
iron
-
merchant
's
cries
and
entreaties
;
but
as
soon
as
they
thought
him
able
to
move
,
they
touched
a
spring
,
which
freed
his
arms
and
legs
from
their
bondage
,
and
raising
him
,
dragged
him
out
of
the
vault
,
and
along
a
narrow
passage
,
till
they
came
to
a
large
sepulchral
-
looking
chamber
,
cased
with
black
marble
,
in
the
midst
of
which
,
on
a
velvet
fauteuil
of
the
same
hue
as
the
walls
,
sat
Cyprian
Rougemont
.
<EOS>
It
was
,
in
fact
,
the
chamber
where
Ebba
had
been
subject
to
her
terrible
trial
.
 
<EOS>
Bewildered
with
terror
,
the
poor
iron
-
merchant
threw
himself
at
the
feet
of
Rougemont
,
who
,
eyeing
him
with
a
look
of
malignant
triumph
,
cried
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
come
to
seek
your
daughter
.
<EOS>
Behold
her
!
"
 
<EOS>
And
at
the
words
,
the
large
black
curtains
at
the
farther
end
of
the
room
were
suddenly
withdrawn
,
and
discovered
the
figure
of
Ebba
Thorneycroft
standing
at
the
foot
of
the
marble
staircase
.
<EOS>
Her
features
were
as
pale
as
death
;
her
limbs
rigid
and
motionless
;
but
her
eyes
blazed
with
preternatural
light
.
<EOS>
On
beholding
her
,
Mr.
Thorneycroft
uttered
a
loud
cry
,
and
,
springing
to
his
feet
would
have
rushed
towards
her
,
but
he
was
held
back
by
the
two
masked
attendants
,
who
seized
each
arm
,
and
detained
him
by
main
force
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ebba
?
"
<EOS>
he
cried--"Ebba
!
"
 
<EOS>
But
she
appeared
wholly
insensible
to
his
cries
,
and
remained
in
the
same
attitude
,
with
her
eyes
turned
away
from
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
ails
her
?
"
cried
the
agonized
father
.
"
<EOS>
Ebba
!
Ebba
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Call
louder
,
"
said
Rougemont
,
with
a
jeering
laugh
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
you
not
know
me
?
<EOS>
do
you
not
hear
me
?
<EOS>
"
shrieked
Mr.
Thorneycroft
.
 
<EOS>
Still
the
figure
remained
immovable
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
told
you
you
should
see
her
,
"
replied
Rougemont
,
in
a
taunting
tone
;
"
but
she
is
beyond
your
reach
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Not
so
,
not
so
!
"
cried
Thorneycroft
.
<EOS>
"
Come
to
me
,
Ebba!--come
to
your
father
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
Heaven
!
<EOS>
she
hears
me
not
!
<EOS>
she
heeds
me
not
!
<EOS>
Her
senses
are
gone
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
She
is
fast
bound
by
a
spell
,
"
said
Rougemont
.
<EOS>
"
Take
a
last
look
at
her
.
<EOS>
You
will
see
her
no
more
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
,
stretching
out
his
hand
,
the
curtains
slowly
descended
,
and
shrouded
the
figure
from
view
.
 
<EOS>
Thorneycroft
groaned
aloud
.
 
<EOS>
"
Are
you
not
content
?
"
cried
Rougemont
.
"
<EOS>
Will
you
depart
in
peace
,
and
swear
never
to
come
here
more
?
<EOS>
If
so
,
I
will
liberate
you
and
your
companions
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
So
far
from
complying
with
your
request
,
I
swear
never
to
rest
till
I
have
rescued
my
child
from
you
,
accursed
being
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Thorneycroft
energetically
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
sealed
your
doom
,
then
,
"
replied
Rougemont
.
"
<EOS>
But
before
you
are
yourself
immured
,
you
shall
see
how
Auriol
Darcy
is
circumstanced
.
<EOS>
Bring
him
along
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
,
followed
by
the
attendants
,
who
dragged
Mr.
Thorneycroft
after
him
,
he
plunged
into
an
opening
on
the
right
.
<EOS>
A
few
steps
brought
him
to
the
entrance
of
the
cell
.
<EOS>
Touching
the
heavy
iron
door
,
it
instantly
swung
open
,
and
disclosed
Auriol
chained
to
a
stone
at
the
farther
corner
of
the
narrow
chamber
.
 
<EOS>
Not
a
word
was
spoken
for
some
minutes
,
but
the
captives
regarded
each
other
piteously
.
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Mr.
Thorneycroft
,
"
cried
Auriol
,
at
length
,
"
I
beseech
<EOS>
you
forgive
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
destroyed
your
daughter
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
!
"
exclaimed
the
iron
-
merchant
,
in
astonishment
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
true
,
"
said
Rougemont
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
would
have
saved
her
if
it
had
been
possible
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Auriol
.
<EOS>
"
I
warned
her
that
to
love
me
would
be
fatal
to
her
.
<EOS>
I
told
her
I
was
linked
to
an
inexorable
destiny
,
which
would
involve
her
in
its
meshes
--
but
in
vain
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
"
ejaculated
Thorneycroft
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
see
you
ought
to
blame
him
,
not
me
,
"
said
Rougemont
,
with
a
derisive
laugh
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
would
have
given
my
life
,
my
soul
,
to
preserve
her
,
<EOS>
had
it
been
possible
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Auriol
.
 
<EOS>
"
Horrors
crowd
so
thick
upon
me
that
my
brain
reels
,
"
cried
Thorneycroft
"
Merciless
wretch
!
"
<EOS>
he
added
,
to
Rougemont
,
"
fiend--
<EOS>
whatever
you
are
,
complete
your
work
of
ruin
by
my
destruction
.
<EOS>
I
have
nothing
left
to
tie
me
to
life
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
would
have
the
miserable
live
,
"
said
Rougemont
,
with
a
diabolical
laugh
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
only
the
happy
I
seek
to
destroy
.
<EOS>
But
you
have
to
thank
your
own
obstinacy
for
your
present
distress
.
<EOS>
Bid
a
lasting
farewell
to
Auriol
.
<EOS>
You
will
see
him
no
more
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Hold
!
"
exclaimed
Auriol
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
word
before
we
part
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
hold
!
<EOS>
"
echoed
a
loud
and
imperious
voice
,
from
the
depths
of
the
passage
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ha!--who
speaks
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
Rougemont
,
a
shade
passing
over
his
countenance
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
,
Gerard
Paston
!
"
exclaimed
Reeks
,
stepping
forward
.
<EOS>
The
crape
was
gone
from
his
brow
,
and
in
its
place
was
seen
the
handsome
and
resolute
features
of
a
man
of
middle
life
.
<EOS>
He
held
a
pistol
in
either
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
Is
it
you
,
Gerard
Paston
?
"
cried
Auriol
,
regarding
him
;
"
the
brother
of
Clara
,
my
second
victim
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
,
"
replied
the
other
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Your
deliverance
is
at
hand
,
Auriol
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
you
have
dared
to
penetrate
here
,
Gerard
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Rougemont
,
stamping
the
ground
with
rage
.
<EOS>
"
Recollect
,
you
are
bound
to
me
by
the
same
ties
as
Auriol
,
and
you
shall
share
his
fate
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
intimidated
by
threats
,
"
replied
Paston
,
with
a
scornful
laugh
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
employed
your
arts
too
long
.
<EOS>
Deliver
up
Auriol
and
this
gentleman
at
once
,
or---
"
<EOS>
And
he
levelled
the
pistols
at
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Fire
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Rougemont
,
drawing
himself
up
to
his
towering
height
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
earthly
bullets
can
injure
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ve'll
try
that
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Ginger
,
coming
up
at
the
moment
behind
Paston
.
 
<EOS>
And
he
discharged
a
pistol
,
with
a
deliberate
aim
,
at
the
breast
of
Rougemont
.
<EOS>
The
latter
remained
erect
,
and
apparently
uninjured
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
see
how
ineffectual
your
weapons
are
,
"
said
Rougemont
,
with
a
derisive
laugh
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
must
be
the
devil
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Ginger
running
off
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
try
mine
,
"
said
Paston
.
 
<EOS>
But
before
he
could
draw
the
triggers
,
the
pistols
were
wrested
from
his
grasp
by
the
two
attendants
,
who
had
quitted
Thorneycroft
,
and
stolen
upon
him
unperceived
,
and
who
next
pinioned
his
arms
.
   
<EOS>
IV
.
<EOS>
THE
PIT
 
<EOS>
So
bewildered
was
the
poor
iron
-
merchant
by
the
strange
and
terrible
events
that
had
befallen
him
,
that
,
though
released
by
the
two
masked
attendants
,
who
left
him
,
as
before
related
,
to
seize
Gerard
Paston
<EOS>
,
he
felt
utterly
incapable
of
exertion
,
and
would
probably
have
made
no
effort
to
regain
his
freedom
,
if
his
coat
had
not
been
vigorously
plucked
behind
,
while
a
low
voice
urged
him
to
fly
.
<EOS>
Glancing
in
the
direction
of
the
friendly
speaker
,
he
could
just
discern
a
diminutive
object
standing
within
the
entrance
of
a
side
-
passage
,
and
reared
up
against
the
wall
so
as
to
be
out
of
sight
of
Rougemont
and
his
attendants
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
monkey
--
or
rather
Old
Parr
--
who
,
continuing
to
tug
violently
at
his
coat
,
at
last
succeeded
in
drawing
him
backwards
into
the
passage
,
and
then
grasping
his
hand
tightly
,
hurried
him
along
it
.
<EOS>
The
passage
was
wholly
unlighted
,
but
Mr.
Thorneycroft
could
perceive
that
it
was
exceedingly
circuitous
,
and
winded
round
like
a
maze
.
 
<EOS>
"
Where
are
you
taking
me
?
"
<EOS>
he
inquired
,
attempting
to
stop
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ask
no
questions
,
"
rejoined
the
dwarf
,
pulling
him
along
.
"
<EOS>
Do
you
want
to
be
captured
,
and
shut
up
in
a
cell
for
the
rest
of
your
life
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Certainly
not
,
"
replied
Thorneycroft
,
accelerating
his
movements
;
"
I
hope
there
's
no
chance
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
There
's
every
chance
of
it
,
"
rejoined
Old
Parr
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
're
taken
,
you
'll
share
Auriol
's
fate
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Lord
!
<EOS>
I
hope
not
,
"
groaned
the
iron
-
merchant
.
<EOS>
"
I
declare
,
you
frighten
me
so
much
that
you
take
away
all
power
of
movement
.
<EOS>
I
shall
drop
in
a
minute
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Come
along
,
I
say
,
"
screamed
the
dwarf
.
<EOS>
"
I
hear
them
close
behind
us
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
as
he
spoke
,
shouts
,
and
the
noise
of
rapidly
approaching
footsteps
,
resounded
along
the
passage
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
stir
another
step
,
"
gasped
the
iron
-
merchant
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
completely
done
.
<EOS>
Better
yield
at
once
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
,
without
a
struggle
?
"
cried
the
dwarf
,
tauntingly
.
"
<EOS>
Think
of
your
daughter
,
and
let
the
thought
of
her
nerve
your
heart
.
<EOS>
She
is
lost
for
ever
,
if
you
do
n't
get
out
of
this
accursed
place
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
She
is
lost
for
ever
as
it
is
,
"
cried
the
iron
-
merchant
despairingly
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
--
she
may
yet
be
saved
,
"
rejoined
the
dwarf
.
<EOS>
"
Come
on
--
come
one--
<EOS>
they
are
close
behind
us
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
it
was
evident
,
from
the
increased
clamour
,
that
their
pursuers
were
upon
them
.
 
<EOS>
Roused
by
the
imminence
of
the
danger
,
and
by
the
hope
of
rescuing
his
daughter
,
Mr.
Thorneycroft
exerted
all
his
energies
,
and
sprang
forward
.
<EOS>
A
little
farther
on
,
they
were
stopped
by
a
door
.
<EOS>
It
was
closed
;
and
venting
his
disappointment
in
a
scream
,
the
dwarf
searched
for
the
handle
,
but
could
not
find
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
are
entrapped
--
we
shall
be
caught
,
"
he
cried
,
"
and
then
woe
to
both
of
us
.
<EOS>
Fool
that
I
was
to
attempt
your
preservation
.
<EOS>
Better
I
had
left
you
to
rot
in
a
dungeon
than
have
incurred
Rougemont
's
displeasure
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
iron
-
merchant
replied
by
a
groan
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
all
over
with
me
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
give
it
up
--
I'll
die
here
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
--
we
are
saved
,
"
cried
the
dwarf
,
as
the
light
,
now
flashing
strongly
upon
the
door
,
revealed
a
small
iron
button
within
it,--
"
saved
--
saved
!
"
 
<EOS>
As
he
spoke
,
he
pressed
against
the
button
,
which
moved
a
spring
,
and
the
door
flew
open
.
<EOS>
Just
as
they
passed
through
it
,
the
two
masked
attendants
came
in
sight
.
<EOS>
The
dwarf
instantly
shut
the
door
,
and
finding
a
bolt
on
the
side
next
him
,
shot
it
into
the
socket
.
<EOS>
Scarcely
had
he
accomplished
this
,
when
the
pursuers
came
up
,
and
dashed
themselves
against
the
door
;
but
finding
it
bolted
,
presently
ceased
their
efforts
,
and
apparently
withdrew
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
are
gone
by
some
other
way
to
intercept
us
,
"
cried
Old
Parr
,
who
had
paused
for
a
moment
to
listen
;
"
come
on
,
Mr.
Thorneycroft
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
'll
try
,
"
replied
the
iron
-
merchant
,
with
a
subdued
groan
,
"
but
I
'm
completely
spent
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
that
I
ever
ventured
into
this
place
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
too
late
to
think
of
that
now
;
besides
,
you
came
here
to
rescue
your
daughter
,
"
rejoined
Old
Parr
.
<EOS>
"
Take
care
and
keep
near
me
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
where
this
passage
leads
to
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
you
know
?
"
inquired
the
iron
-
merchant
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
in
the
least
,
"
returned
the
dwarf
.
<EOS>
"
This
is
the
first
time
I
've
been
here
--
and
it
shall
be
the
last
,
if
I
'm
allowed
any
choice
in
the
matter
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
n't
told
me
how
you
came
here
at
all
,
"
observed
Thorneycroft
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
hardly
know
myself
,
"
replied
the
dwarf
;
"
but
I
find
it
more
difficult
to
get
out
than
I
did
to
get
in
.
<EOS>
How
this
passage
twists
about
.
<EOS>
I
declare
we
seem
to
be
returning
to
the
point
we
started
from
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
we
are
turning
round
ourselves
,
"
cried
Thorneycroft
,
in
an
agony
of
fright
.
<EOS>
"
My
head
is
going
.
<EOS>
Oh
dear
!
<EOS>
oh
dear
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Why
it
does
seem
very
strange
,
I
must
say
,
"
remarked
the
dwarf
,
coming
to
a
halt
.
<EOS>
"
I
could
almost
fancy
that
the
solid
stone
walls
were
moving
around
us
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
They
are
moving
,
"
cried
Thorneycroft
,
stretching
out
his
hand
.
<EOS>
"
I
feel
'em
.
<EOS>
Lord
have
mercy
upon
us
,
and
deliver
us
from
the
power
of
the
Evil
One
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
place
seems
on
fire
,
"
cried
the
dwarf
.
<EOS>
"
A
thick
smoke
fills
the
passage
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
perceive
it
,
Mr.
Thorneycroft
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
I!--to
be
sure
I
do
,
"
cried
the
iron
-
merchant
,
coughing
and
sneezing
.
<EOS>
"
I
feel
as
if
I
were
in
a
room
with
a
smoky
chimney
,
and
no
window
open
.
<EOS>
Oh!--oh!--I'm
choking
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
mind
it
,
"
cried
the
dwarf
,
who
seemed
quite
at
his
ease
.
<EOS>
"
We
shall
soon
be
out
of
the
smoke
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
stand
it
,
"
cried
Mr.
Thorneycroft
;
"
I
shall
die
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
poah--
pish
--
puff
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Come
on
,
I
tell
you
--
you'll
get
some
fresh
air
in
a
minute
,
"
rejoined
Old
Parr
.
"
<EOS>
Halloa
!
<EOS>
how
's
this
?
<EOS>
No
outlet
.
<EOS>
We
're
come
to
a
dead
stop
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Dead
stop
,
indeed
!
"
echoed
the
iron
-
merchant
.
<EOS>
"
We
've
come
to
that
long
ago
.
<EOS>
But
what
new
difficulty
has
arisen
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Merely
that
the
road
's
blocked
up
by
a
solid
wall
--
that
's
all
,
"
replied
Old
Parr
.
 
<EOS>
"
Blocked
up
!
"
exclaimed
Thorneycroft
.
<EOS>
"
Then
we
're
entombed
alive
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
,
"
said
the
dwarf
,
with
affected
nonchalance
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
to
you
,
you
've
the
comfort
of
knowing
it
'll
soon
be
over
with
you
.
<EOS>
But
for
me
,
nothing
can
harm
me
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
be
too
sure
of
that
,
"
cried
a
voice
above
them
.
 
<EOS>
"
Did
you
speak
,
Mr.
Thorneycroft
?
<EOS>
"
asked
the
dwarf
.
 
<EOS>
"
N
-
o
-
o
--
not
I
,
"
gasped
the
iron
-
merchant
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
suffocating
--
help
to
drag
me
out
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Get
out
if
you
can
,
"
cried
the
voice
that
had
just
spoken
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
Rougemont
himself
,
"
cried
the
dwarf
,
in
alarm
.
<EOS>
"
Then
there
's
no
escape
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
None
whatever
,
rascal
,
"
replied
the
unseen
speaker
.
<EOS>
"
I
want
you
.
<EOS>
I
have
more
work
for
you
to
do
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
wo
n't
leave
Mr.
Thorneycroft
,
"
cried
the
dwarf
,
resolutely
.
<EOS>
"
I
've
promised
to
preserve
him
,
and
I
'll
keep
my
word
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Fool
!
"
cried
the
other
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
obey
when
I
command
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
as
the
words
were
uttered
,
a
hand
was
thrust
down
from
above
,
which
,
grasping
the
dwarf
by
the
nape
of
the
neck
,
drew
him
upwards
.
 
<EOS>
"
Lay
hold
of
me
,
Mr.
Thorneycroft
,
"
screamed
Old
Parr
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
going
up
again
--
lay
hold
of
me
--
pull
me
down
.
"
 
<EOS>
Well
-
nigh
stifled
by
the
thickening
and
pungent
vapour
,
the
poor
iron-
merchant
found
compliance
impossible
.
<EOS>
Before
he
could
reach
the
dwarf
,
the
little
fellow
was
carried
off
.
<EOS>
Left
to
himself
,
Mr.
Thorneycroft
staggered
along
the
passage
,
expecting
every
moment
to
drop
,
until
at
length
a
current
of
fresh
air
blew
in
his
face
,
and
enabled
him
to
breathe
more
freely
.
<EOS>
Some
what
revived
,
he
went
on
,
but
with
great
deliberation
,
and
it
was
well
<EOS>
he
did
so
<EOS>
,
for
he
suddenly
arrived
at
the
brink
of
a
pit
about
eight
feet
in
depth
,
into
which
,
if
he
had
approached
it
incautiously
,
he
must
infallibly
have
stumbled
,
and
in
all
probability
have
broken
his
neck
.
<EOS>
This
pit
evidently
communicated
with
a
lower
range
of
chambers
,
as
was
shown
by
a
brazen
lamp
burning
under
an
archway
.
<EOS>
A
ladder
was
planted
at
one
side
,
and
by
this
Mr.
Thorneycroft
descended
,
but
scarcely
had
he
set
foot
on
the
ground
,
than
he
felt
himself
rudely
grasped
by
a
man
who
stepped
from
under
the
archway
.
<EOS>
The
next
moment
,
however
,
he
was
released
,
while
the
familiar
voice
of
the
Tinker
exclaimed
.
 
<EOS>
"
Vy
,
bless
my
'
art
,
if
it
ai
n't
Mister
Thorneycroft
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
it
's
me
,
certainly
,
Mr.
Tinker
,
"
replied
the
iron
-
merchant
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Who
's
that
you
've
got
with
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Vy
,
who
should
it
be
<EOS>
but
the
Sandman
,
"
rejoined
the
other
,
gruffly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ve've
set
ourselves
free
at
last
,
and
have
made
some
nice
diskiveries
into
the
bargin
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
ve've
found
it
all
out
,
added
the
Tinker
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
have
you
discovered
--
what
have
you
found
out
?
"
cried
the
iron-
merchant
,
breathlessly
.
"
<EOS>
Have
you
found
my
daughter
?
<EOS>
Where
is
she
?
<EOS>
Take
me
to
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Not
so
fast
,
old
gent
,
not
so
fast
,
"
rejoined
the
Tinker
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ye
ai
n't
sure
as
'
ow
ve've
found
your
darter
,
but
ve've
catched
a
peep
of
a
nice
young
'
ooman
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
it
must
be
her
no
doubt
of
it
,
"
cried
the
iron
-
merchant
.
<EOS>
"
Where
is
she
?
<EOS>
Take
me
to
her
without
a
moment
's
delay
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
ve
ca
n't
get
to
her
,
I
tell
'
ee
,
"
replied
the
Tinker
,
"
Ye
knows
the
place
'
vere
<EOS>
she
's
a
-
shut
<EOS>
up,--that
's
all
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Take
me
to
it
,
"
cried
Mr.
Thorneycroft
,
eagerly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yell
,
if
you
must
go
,
step
this
vay
,
then
,
"
rejoined
the
Tinker
,
proceeding
towards
the
archway
.
<EOS>
"
Halloa
,
Sandy
,
did
you
shut
the
door
arter
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Not
I
,
"
replied
the
other
;
"
open
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Easily
said
,
"
rejoined
the
Tinker
,
"
but
not
quevite
so
easily
done
.
<EOS>
Vy
,
zounds
,
it
's
shut
of
itself
and
bolted
itself
on
t'other
side
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Someone
must
have
followed
you
,
"
groaned
Thorneycroft
.
<EOS>
"
We
're
watched
on
all
sides
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
and
from
above
,
too
,
"
cried
the
Sandman
.
<EOS>
"
Look
up
there
!
"
<EOS>
he
added
,
in
accents
of
alarm
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
matter
?
<EOS>
What
new
danger
is
at
hand
?
<EOS>
"
inquired
the
iron-
merchant
.
 
<EOS>
"
Look
up
,
I
say
,
"
cried
the
Sandman
.
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
ye
see
,
Tinker
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
ay
,
I
see
,
"
replied
the
other
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
roof
's
a
-
comin
'
in
upon
us
.
<EOS>
Let
's
get
out
o
'
this
as
fast
as
ve
can
.
"
<EOS>
And
he
kicked
and
pushed
against
the
door
,
but
all
his
efforts
were
unavailing
to
burst
it
open
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
the
Sandman
rushed
towards
the
ladder
,
but
before
he
could
mount
it
all
egress
by
that
means
was
cut
off
.
<EOS>
An
immense
iron
cover
worked
in
a
groove
was
pushed
by
some
unseen
machinery
over
the
top
of
the
pit
,
and
enclosed
them
in
it
.
   
<EOS>
V.
NEW
PERPLEXITIES
 
<EOS>
For
several
hours
deep
sleep
,
occasioned
by
some
potent
medicaments
,
had
bound
up
the
senses
of
Auriol
.
<EOS>
On
awaking
,
he
found
himself
within
a
cell
,
the
walls
,
the
floor
,
and
the
ceiling
of
which
were
of
solid
stone
masonry
.
<EOS>
In
the
midst
of
this
chamber
,
and
supporting
the
ponderous
roof
,
stood
a
massive
granite
pillar
,
the
capital
of
which
was
grotesquely
ornamented
with
death's
-
heads
and
crossbones
,
and
against
this
pillar
leaned
Auriol
,
with
his
left
arm
chained
by
heavy
links
of
iron
to
a
ring
in
the
adjoining
wall
.
<EOS>
Beside
him
stood
a
pitcher
of
water
,
and
near
him
lay
an
antique
-
looking
book
,
bound
in
black
vellum
.
<EOS>
The
dungeon
in
which
he
was
confined
was
circular
in
form
,
with
a
coved
roof
,
sustained
by
the
pillar
before
mentioned
,
and
was
approached
by
a
steep
flight
of
steps
rising
from
a
doorway
,
placed
some
six
feet
below
the
level
of
the
chamber
,
and
surmounted
by
a
pointed
arch
.
<EOS>
A
stream
of
light
,
descending
from
a
narrow
aperture
in
the
roof
,
fell
upon
his
wasted
and
haggard
features
.
<EOS>
His
dark
brown
hair
hung
about
his
face
in
elf
-
locks
,
his
beard
was
untrimmed
,
and
a
fixed
and
stony
glare
like
that
of
insanity
sat
in
his
eye
.
<EOS>
He
was
seated
on
the
ground
--
<EOS>
neither
bench
nor
stool
being
allowed
him
--
with
his
hand
supporting
his
chin
.
<EOS>
His
gaze
was
fixed
upon
vacancy
--
if
that
can
be
called
vacancy
,
which
to
him
was
filled
with
vivid
images
.
<EOS>
His
garb
was
not
that
of
modern
times
,
but
consisted
of
a
doublet
and
hose
of
rich
material
,
wrought
in
the
fashion
of
Elizabeth
's
days
.
 
<EOS>
After
remaining
for
some
time
in
this
musing
attitude
,
Auriol
opened
the
old
tome
before
him
,
and
began
to
turn
over
its
leaves
.
<EOS>
It
was
full
of
magical
disquisitions
and
mysterious
characters
,
and
he
found
inscribed
on
one
of
its
earlier
pages
a
name
which
instantly
riveted
his
attention
.
<EOS>
Having
vainly
sought
some
explanation
of
this
name
in
the
after
contents
of
the
book
,
he
laid
it
aside
,
and
became
lost
in
meditation
.
<EOS>
His
reverie
ended
,
he
heaved
a
deep
sigh
,
and
turned
again
to
the
open
volume
lying
before
him
,
and
in
doing
so
his
eye
rested
for
the
first
time
on
his
habiliments
.
<EOS>
On
beholding
them
he
started
,
and
held
out
his
arm
to
examine
the
sleeve
more
narrowly
.
<EOS>
Satisfied
that
he
was
not
deceived
,
he
arose
and
examined
himself
from
head
to
foot
.
<EOS>
He
found
himself
,
as
has
been
stated
,
attired
in
the
garb
of
a
gentleman
of
Elizabeth
's
time
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
can
this
mean
?
<EOS>
"
he
cried
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Have
I
endured
a
long
and
troubled
dream
,
during
which
I
have
fancied
myself
living
through
more
than
two
centuries
?
<EOS>
Oh
,
Heaven
,
that
it
may
be
so
!
<EOS>
Oh
,
that
the
fearful
crimes
I
suppose
I
have
committed
have
only
been
enacted
in
a
dream
!
<EOS>
Oh
,
that
my
victims
are
imaginary
!
<EOS>
Oh
,
that
Ebba
should
only
prove
a
lovely
phantom
of
the
night
!
<EOS>
And
yet
,
I
could
almost
wish
the
rest
were
real
--
so
that
she
might
exist
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
bear
to
think
that
she
is
nothing
more
than
a
vision
,
But
it
must
be
so
<EOS>
--
I
have
been
dreaming--
and
what
a
dream
<EOS>
it
has
been!--what
strange
glimpses
it
has
afforded
me
into
futurity
!
<EOS>
Methought
I
lived
in
the
reigns
of
many
sovereigns--
beheld
one
of
them
carried
to
the
block
--
saw
revolutions
convulse
the
kingdom
--
<EOS>
old
dynasties
shaken
down
,
and
new
ones
spring
up
.
<EOS>
Fashions
seem
to
me
to
have
so
changed
,
that
I
had
clean
forgotten
the
old
ones
;
while
my
fellow
-
men
scarcely
appeared
the
same
as
heretofore
.
<EOS>
Can
I
be
the
same
myself
?
<EOS>
Is
this
the
dress
I
once
wore
?
<EOS>
Let
me
seek
for
some
proof
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
thrusting
his
hand
into
his
doublet
,
he
drew
forth
some
tablets
,
and
hastily
examined
them
.
<EOS>
They
bore
his
name
,
and
contained
some
writing
,
and
he
exclaimed
aloud
with
joy
,
"
This
is
proof
enough
--
I
have
been
dreaming
all
this
while
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
scheme
works
to
a
miracle
,
"
muttered
a
personage
stationed
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
springing
from
the
doorway
,
and
who
,
though
concealed
from
view
himself
,
was
watching
the
prisoner
with
a
malignant
and
exulting
gaze
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
yet
,
why
am
I
here
?
"
pursued
Auriol
,
looking
around
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
I
see
how
it
is
,
"
he
added
,
with
a
shudder
;
"
I
have
been
mad
--
perhaps
am
mad
still
.
<EOS>
That
will
account
for
the
strange
delusion
under
which
I
have
laboured
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
act
upon
that
hint
,
"
muttered
the
listener
.
 
<EOS>
"
Of
what
use
is
memory
,
"
continued
Auriol
,
musingly
,
"
if
things
that
are
not
,
seem
as
if
they
were
?
<EOS>
If
joys
and
sorrows
which
we
have
never
endured
are
stamped
upon
the
brain
--
if
visions
of
scenes
,
and
faces
and
events
which
we
have
never
witnessed
,
never
known
,
haunt
us
,
as
if
they
had
once
been
familiar
?
<EOS>
But
I
am
mad
--
mad
!
"
 
<EOS>
The
listener
laughed
to
himself
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
else
,
if
I
were
not
mad
,
could
I
have
believed
that
I
had
swallowed
the
fabled
elixir
vitae
?
<EOS>
And
yet
,
is
it
a
fable
?
<EOS>
for
I
am
puzzled
still
.
<EOS>
Methinks
<EOS>
I
am
old
--
old
--
<EOS>
old
--
though
I
feel
young
,
and
look
young
.
<EOS>
All
this
is
madness
.
<EOS>
Yet
how
clear
and
distinct
it
seems
!
<EOS>
I
can
call
to
mind
events
in
Charles
the
Second
's
time
.
<EOS>
Ha!--who
told
me
of
Charles
the
Second
?
<EOS>
How
know
I
there
was
such
a
king
?
<EOS>
The
reigning
sovereign
should
be
James
,
and
yet
I
fancy
<EOS>
it
is
George
the
Fourth
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
I
am
mad
--
clean
mad
!
"
 
<EOS>
There
was
another
pause
,
during
which
the
listener
indulged
in
a
suppressed
fit
of
laughter
.
<EOS>
"
Would
I
could
look
forth
from
this
dungeon
,
"
pursued
Auriol
,
again
breaking
silence
,
"
and
satisfy
myself
of
the
truth
or
falsehood
of
my
doubts
by
a
view
of
the
external
world
,
for
I
am
so
perplexed
in
mind
,
that
if
I
were
not
distracted
already
,
they
would
be
enough
to
drive
me
so
.
<EOS>
What
dismal
,
terrible
fancies
have
possessed
me
,
and
weigh
upon
me
still
--
the
compact
with
Rougemont
--
ha
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Now
it
comes
,
"
cried
the
listener
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
that
I
could
shake
off
the
conviction
that
this
were
not
so
--
that
my
soul
,
though
heavily
laden
,
might
still
be
saved
!
<EOS>
Oh
,
that
I
dared
to
hope
this
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
must
interrupt
him
if
he
pursues
this
strain
,
"
said
the
listener
.
 
<EOS>
"
Whether
my
crimes
are
real
or
imaginary
--
whether
I
snatched
the
cup
of
immortality
from
my
grandsire
's
dying
lips
--
whether
I
signed
a
compact
with
the
Fiend
,
and
delivered
him
a
victim
on
each
tenth
year
--
I
can
not
now
know
;
but
if
it
is
so
,
I
deeply
,
deeply
regret
them
,
and
would
expiate
my
offences
by
a
life
of
penance
.
"
 
<EOS>
At
this
moment
Rougemont
,
attired
in
a
dress
similar
to
that
of
the
prisoner
,
marched
up
the
steps
,
and
cried
,
"
<EOS>
What
ho
,
Auriol!--Auriol
Darcy
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Who
speaks
?
"
demanded
Auriol
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
is
it
you
,
Fiend
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
,
you
are
still
in
your
old
fancies
,
"
rejoined
Rougemont
.
<EOS>
"
I
thought
the
draught
I
gave
you
last
night
would
have
amended
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Tell
me
who
and
what
I
am
,
"
cried
Auriol
,
stupefied
with
astonishment
;
"
in
what
age
I
am
living
;
and
whether
I
am
in
my
right
mind
or
not
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
For
the
first
,
you
are
called
Auriol
Darcy
,
"
replied
Rougemont
;
"
for
the
second
,
you
are
living
in
the
reign
of
his
most
Catholic
Majesty
James
I
of
England
,
and
VIth
of
Scotland
;
and
for
the
third
,
I
trust
you
will
soon
recover
your
reason
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Amazement
!
"
cried
Auriol
,
striking
his
brow
with
his
clenched
hand
.
<EOS>
"
Then
I
am
mad
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
plain
your
reason
is
returning
,
since
you
are
conscious
of
your
condition
,
"
replied
Rougemont
;
"
but
calm
yourself
,
you
have
been
subject
to
raging
frenzies
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
I
have
been
shut
up
here
for
safety
?
"
demanded
Auriol
.
 
<EOS>
"
Precisely
,
"
observed
the
other
.
"
<EOS>
And
you
are---
"
 
"
Your
keeper
,
"
replied
Rougemont
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
God
!
<EOS>
what
a
brain
mine
must
be
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Auriol
.
<EOS>
"
Answer
me
one
question
--
Is
there
such
a
person
as
Ebba
Thorneycroft
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
often
raved
about
her
,
"
replied
Rougemont
.
<EOS>
"
But
she
is
a
mere
creature
of
the
imagination
.
"
 
<EOS>
Auriol
groaned
,
and
sank
against
the
wall
.
 
<EOS>
"
Since
you
have
become
so
reasonable
,
you
shall
again
go
forth
into
the
world
,
"
said
Rougemont
;
"
but
the
first
essay
must
be
made
at
night
,
for
fear
of
attracting
observation
.
<EOS>
I
will
come
to
you
again
a
few
hours
hence
.
<EOS>
Farewell
,
for
the
present
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
casting
a
sinister
glance
at
his
captive
,
he
turned
upon
his
heel
,
descended
the
steps
,
and
quitted
the
cell
.
   
<EOS>
VI
.
<EOS>
DOCTOR
LAMB
<EOS>
AGAIN
 
<EOS>
Night
came
,
and
the
cell
grew
profoundly
dark
.
<EOS>
Auriol
became
impatient
for
the
appearance
of
his
keeper
,
but
hour
after
hour
passed
<EOS>
and
he
did
not
arrive
.
<EOS>
Worn
out
,
at
length
,
with
doubt
and
bewildering
speculations
,
the
miserable
captive
was
beset
with
the
desire
to
put
an
end
to
his
torments
by
suicide
,
and
he
determined
to
execute
his
fell
purpose
without
delay
.
<EOS>
An
evil
chance
seemed
also
to
befriend
him
,
for
scarcely
was
the
idea
formed
,
than
his
foot
encountered
something
on
the
ground
,
the
rattling
of
which
attracted
his
attention
,
and
stooping
to
take
it
up
,
he
grasped
the
bare
blade
of
a
knife
.
 
<EOS>
"
This
will
,
at
all
events
,
solve
my
doubts
,
"
he
cried
aloud
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
sheathe
this
weapon
in
my
heart
,
and
,
if
I
am
mortal
,
my
woes
will
be
ended
.
"
 
<EOS>
As
he
spoke
,
be
placed
the
point
to
his
breast
with
the
full
intent
to
strike
,
but
before
he
could
inflict
the
slightest
wound
,
his
arm
was
forcibly
arrested
.
 
<EOS>
"
Would
you
destroy
yourself
,
madman
?
"
<EOS>
roared
a
voice
.
<EOS>
"
I
thought
your
violence
was
abated
,
and
that
you
might
go
forth
in
safety
.
<EOS>
But
I
find
you
are
worse
than
ever
.
"
 
<EOS>
Auriol
uttered
a
groan
and
let
the
knife
fall
to
the
ground
.
<EOS>
The
newcomer
kicked
it
to
a
distance
with
his
foot
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
shall
be
removed
to
another
chamber
,
"
he
pursued
,
"
where
you
can
be
more
strictly
watched
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Take
me
forth
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
take
me
forth
,
"
cried
Auriol
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
a
mere
impulse
of
desperation
,
which
I
now
repent
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
dare
not
trust
you
.
<EOS>
You
will
commit
some
act
of
insane
fury
,
for
which
I
myself
shall
have
to
bear
the
blame
.
<EOS>
When
I
yielded
to
your
entreaties
on
a
former
occasion
,
and
took
you
forth
,
I
narrowly
prevented
you
from
doing
all
we
met
a
mischief
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
recollection
of
any
such
circumstance
,
"
returned
Auriol
,
mournfully
.
<EOS>
"
But
it
may
be
true
,
nevertheless
.
<EOS>
And
if
so
,
it
only
proves
the
lamentable
condition
to
which
I
am
reduced
memory
and
reason
gone
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
both
gone
,
"
cried
the
other
,
with
an
irrepressible
chuckle
.
"
<EOS>
Ha
!
"
exclaimed
Auriol
,
starring
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
so
mad
<EOS>
but
I
recognize
in
you
the
Evil
Being
who
tempted
me
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
so
oblivious
as
to
forget
our
terrible
interviews
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
,
you
are
in
your
lunes
again
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Rougemont
fiercely
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Nay
,
then
I
must
call
my
assistants
,
and
bin
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Let
me
be
--
let
me
be
!
"
<EOS>
implored
Auriol
,
"
and
I
will
offend
you
no
more
.
<EOS>
Whatever
thoughts
may
arise
within
me
,
I
will
not
give
utterance
to
them
.
<EOS>
Only
take
me
forth
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
came
for
that
purpose
,
"
said
Rougemont
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
repeat
,
I
dare
not
.
<EOS>
You
are
not
sufficiently
master
of
yourself
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Try
me
,
"
said
Auriol
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
rejoined
the
other
,
"
I
will
see
what
I
can
do
to
calm
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
disappeared
for
a
few
moments
,
and
then
returning
with
a
torch
,
placed
it
on
the
ground
,
and
producing
a
phial
,
handed
it
to
the
captive
.
 
<EOS>
"
Drink
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
.
 
<EOS>
Without
a
moment
's
hesitation
Auriol
complied
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
seems
to
me
rather
a
stimulant
than
a
soothing
potion
,
"
he
remarked
,
after
emptying
the
phial
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
in
no
condition
to
judge
,
"
rejoined
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
And
he
proceeded
to
unfasten
Auriol
's
chain
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
then
,
come
with
me
,
"
he
said
,
"
and
do
not
make
any
attempt
at
evasion
,
or
you
will
rue
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
Like
one
in
a
dream
,
Auriol
followed
his
conductor
down
the
flight
of
steps
leading
from
the
dungeon
,
and
along
a
narrow
passage
.
<EOS>
As
he
proceeded
,
he
thought
he
heard
stealthy
footsteps
behind
him
;
but
he
never
turned
his
head
,
to
see
whether
he
was
really
followed
.
<EOS>
In
this
way
they
reached
a
short
steep
staircase
,
and
,
mounting
it
,
entered
a
vault
,
in
which
Rougemont
paused
,
and
placed
the
torch
he
had
brought
with
him
upon
the
floor
.
<EOS>
Its
lurid
glimmer
partially
illumined
the
chamber
,
and
showed
that
it
was
built
of
stone
.
<EOS>
Rude
benches
of
antique
form
were
set
about
the
vault
,
and
motioning
Auriol
to
be
seated
upon
one
of
them
,
Rougemont
sounded
a
silver
whistle
.
<EOS>
The
summons
was
shortly
afterwards
answered
by
the
dwarf
,
in
whose
attire
a
new
change
had
taken
place
.
<EOS>
He
was
now
clothed
in
a
jerkin
of
grey
serge
,
fashioned
like
the
garments
worn
by
the
common
people
in
Elizabeth
's
reign
,
and
wore
a
trencher
cap
on
his
head
.
<EOS>
Auriol
watched
him
as
he
timidly
advanced
towards
Rougemont
,
and
had
an
indistinct
recollection
of
having
seen
him
before
;
but
could
not
call
to
mind
how
or
where
.
 
<EOS>
"
Is
your
master
a
-
bed
?
"
demanded
Rougemont
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
-
bed
!
<EOS>
Good
lack
,
sir
!
"
exclaimed
the
dwarf
,
"
little
of
sleep
;
knows
Doctor
Lamb
.
<EOS>
He
will
toil
at
the
furnace
till
the
stars
have
set
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Doctor
Lamb
!
"
repeated
Auriol
.
<EOS>
"
Surely
I
have
heard
that
name
before
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Very
likely
,
"
replied
Rougemont
,
"
for
it
is
the
name
borne
by
your
nearest
kinsman
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
How
is
the
poor
young
gentleman
?
"
asked
the
dwarf
,
glancing
commiseratingly
at
Auriol
.
<EOS>
"
My
master
often
makes
inquiries
after
his
grandson
,
and
grieves
that
the
state
of
his
mind
should
render
it
necessary
to
confine
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
His
grandson
!
<EOS>
I
--
Doctor
Lamb
's
grandson
!
"
cried
Auriol
.
 
<EOS>
"
In
sooth
are
you
,
young
sir
,
"
returned
the
dwarf
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Were
you
in
your
reason
,
you
would
be
aware
that
my
master
's
name
is
the
same
as
your
own
--
Darcy
--
Reginald
Darcy
.
<EOS>
He
assumes
the
name
of
Doctor
Lamb
to
delude
the
multitude
.
<EOS>
He
told
you
as
much
yourself
,
sweet
sir
,
if
your
poor
wits
would
enable
you
to
recollect
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Am
I
in
a
dream
,
good
fellow
,
tell
me
that
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Auriol
,
lost
in
amazement
.
 
<EOS>
"
Alack
,
no
,
sir
,
"
replied
the
dwarf
;
"
to
my
thinking
,
you
are
wide
awake
.
<EOS>
But
you
know
,
sir
,
"
he
added
,
touching
his
forehead
,
"
you
have
been
a
little
wrong
here
,
and
your
memory
and
reason
are
not
of
the
clearest
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Where
does
my
grandsire
dwell
?
"
asked
Auriol
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
here
,
sir
,
"
replied
the
dwarf
;
"
and
for
the
matter
of
locality
,
the
house
is
situated
on
the
south
end
of
London
-
bridge
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
On
the
bridge
--
did
you
say
on
the
bridge
,
friend
?
"
cried
Auriol
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
on
the
bridge
--
where
else
should
it
be
?
<EOS>
You
would
not
have
your
grandsire
live
under
the
river
?
<EOS>
"
rejoined
the
dwarf
;
"
though
,
for
ought
I
know
,
some
of
these
vaults
may
go
under
it
.
<EOS>
They
are
damp
enough
.
"
 
<EOS>
Auriol
was
lost
in
reflection
,
and
did
not
observe
a
sign
that
passed
between
the
dwarf
and
Rougemont
.
 
<EOS>
"
Will
it
disturb
Doctor
Lamb
if
his
grandson
goes
up
to
him
?
"
said
the
latter
,
after
a
brief
pause
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
master
does
not
like
to
be
interrupted
in
his
operations
,
as
you
know
,
sir
,
"
replied
the
dwarf
,
"
and
seldom
suffers
anyone
,
except
myself
,
to
enter
his
laboratory
;
but
I
will
make
so
bold
as
to
introduce
Master
Auriol
,
if
he
desires
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
will
confer
the
greatest
favour
on
me
by
doing
so
,
"
cried
Auriol
,
rising
.
 
<EOS>
"
Sit
down
--
sit
down
!
"
<EOS>
said
Rougemont
,
authoritatively
.
<EOS>
"
You
can
not
go
up
till
the
doctor
has
been
apprised
.
<EOS>
Remain
here
,
while
Flapdragon
and
I
ascertain
his
wishes
.
"
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
quitted
the
chamber
by
a
farther
outlet
with
the
dwarf
.
 
<EOS>
During
the
short
time
that
Auriol
was
left
alone
,
he
found
it
vain
to
attempt
to
settle
his
thoughts
,
or
to
convince
himself
that
he
was
not
labouring
under
some
strange
delusion
.
<EOS>
He
was
aroused
at
length
by
the
dwarf
,
who
returned
alone
.
 
<EOS>
"
Your
grandsire
will
see
you
,
"
said
the
mannikin
.
 
<EOS>
"
One
word
before
we
go
,
"
cried
Auriol
,
seizing
his
arm
.
 
<EOS>
"
Saints
!
<EOS>
how
you
frighten
me
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
the
dwarf
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
keep
composed
,
or
I
dare
not
take
you
to
my
master
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Pardon
me
,
"
replied
Auriol
;
"
I
meant
not
to
alarm
you
.
<EOS>
Where
is
the
person
who
brought
me
hither
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
,
your
keeper
?
"
said
the
dwarf
.
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
he
is
within
call
.
<EOS>
He
will
come
to
you
anon
.
<EOS>
Now
follow
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
taking
up
the
torch
,
he
led
the
way
out
of
the
chamber
.
<EOS>
Mounting
a
spiral
staircase
,
apparently
within
a
turret
,
they
came
to
a
door
,
which
being
opened
by
Flapdragon
,
disclosed
a
scene
that
well
-
nigh
stupefied
Auriol
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
the
laboratory
precisely
as
he
had
seen
it
above
two
centuries
ago
.
<EOS>
The
floor
was
strewn
with
alchemical
implements
--
the
table
was
covered
with
mystic
parchments
inscribed
with
cabalistic
characters--
the
furnace
stood
in
the
corner
--
<EOS>
crucibles
and
cucurbites
decorated
the
chimney
-
board
--
the
sphere
and
brazen
lamp
hung
from
the
ceiling--
<EOS>
the
skeletons
grinned
from
behind
the
chimney
-
corner
--
all
was
there
as
he
had
seen
it
before
!
<EOS>
There
was
also
Doctor
Lamb
,
in
his
loose
gown
of
sable
silk
,
with
a
square
black
cap
upon
his
venerable
head
,
and
his
snowy
beard
streaming
to
his
girdle
.
 
<EOS>
The
old
man
's
gaze
was
fixed
upon
a
crucible
placed
upon
the
furnace
,
and
he
was
occupied
in
working
the
bellows
.
<EOS>
He
moved
his
head
as
Auriol
entered
the
chamber
,
and
the
features
became
visible
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
face
never
to
be
forgotten
.
 
<EOS>
"
Come
in
,
grandson
,
"
said
the
old
man
,
kindly
.
<EOS>
"
Come
in
,
and
close
the
door
after
you
.
<EOS>
The
draught
affects
the
furnace
--
my
Athanor
,
as
we
adepts
term
it
.
<EOS>
So
you
are
better
,
your
keeper
tells
me
--
much
better
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Are
you
Indeed
living
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Auriol
,
rushing
wildly
towards
him
,
and
attempting
to
take
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
Off
--
off
!
"
cried
the
old
man
,
drawing
back
as
if
alarmed
.
<EOS>
"
You
disturb
my
operations
.
<EOS>
Keep
him
calm
,
Flapdragon
,
or
take
him
hence
.
<EOS>
He
may
do
me
a
mischief
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
such
intention
,
sir
,
"
said
Auriol
;
"
indeed
I
have
not
.
<EOS>
I
only
wish
to
be
assured
that
you
are
my
aged
relative
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
To
be
sure
he
is
,
young
sir
,
"
interposed
the
dwarf
.
<EOS>
"
Why
should
you
doubt
it
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
sir
,
"
cried
Auriol
,
throwing
himself
at
the
old
man
's
feet
,
"
pity
me
if
I
am
mad
;
but
offer
me
some
explanation
,
which
may
tend
to
restore
me
to
my
senses
.
<EOS>
My
reason
seems
gone
,
yet
I
appear
capable
of
receiving
impressions
from
external
objects
.
<EOS>
I
see
you
,
and
appear
to
know
you
.
<EOS>
I
see
this
chamber
--
these
alchemical
implements
--
that
furnace
--
these
different
objects
--
and
I
appear
to
recognize
them
.
<EOS>
Am
I
deceived
,
or
is
this
real
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
not
deceived
,
my
son
,
"
replied
the
old
man
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
been
in
this
room
before
,
and
you
have
seen
me
before
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
useless
to
explain
to
you
now
how
you
have
suffered
from
fever
,
and
what
visions
your
delirium
has
produced
.
<EOS>
When
you
are
perfectly
restored
,
we
will
talk
the
matter
over
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
,
as
he
said
this
,
he
began
to
blow
the
fire
anew
,
and
watched
with
great
apparent
interest
the
changing
colours
of
the
liquid
cucurbite
placed
on
the
furnace
.
 
<EOS>
Auriol
looked
at
him
earnestly
,
but
could
not
catch
another
glance
,
so
intently
was
the
old
man
occupied
.
<EOS>
At
length
he
ventured
to
break
the
silence
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
feel
perfectly
convinced
,
if
I
might
look
forth
from
that
window
,
"
he
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
Convinced
of
what
?
"
rejoined
the
old
man
,
somewhat
sharply
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
I
am
what
I
seem
,
"
replied
Auriol
.
 
<EOS>
"
Look
forth
,
then
,
"
said
the
old
man
.
<EOS>
"
But
do
not
disturb
me
by
idle
talk
.
<EOS>
There
is
the
rosy
colour
in
the
projection
for
which
I
have
been
so
long
waiting
.
"
 
<EOS>
Auriol
then
walked
to
the
window
and
gazed
through
the
tinted
panes
.
<EOS>
It
was
very
dark
,
and
objects
could
only
be
imperfectly
distinguished
.
<EOS>
Still
he
fancied
he
could
detect
the
gleam
of
the
river
beneath
him
,
and
what
seemed
a
long
line
of
houses
on
the
bridge
.
<EOS>
He
also
fancied
he
discerned
other
buildings
,
with
the
high
roofs
,
the
gables
,
and
the
other
architectural
peculiarities
of
the
structures
of
Elizabeth
's
time
.
<EOS>
He
persuaded
himself
,
also
,
that
he
could
distinguish
through
the
gloom
the
venerable
Gothic
pile
of
Saint
Paul
's
Cathedral
on
the
other
side
of
the
water
,
and
,
as
if
to
satisfy
him
that
he
was
right
,
a
deep
solemn
bell
tolled
forth
the
hour
of
two
.
<EOS>
After
a
while
he
returned
from
the
window
,
and
said
to
his
supposed
grandsire
,
"
I
am
satisfied
.
<EOS>
I
have
lived
centuries
in
a
few
nights
.

<EOS>
THE
CHARLES
<EOS>
THE
SECOND
SPANIEL
 
<EOS>
IT
was
about
two
o'clock
,
on
a
charming
spring
day
,
that
a
stout
middle
-
aged
man
,
accompanied
by
a
young
person
of
extraordinary
beauty
,
took
up
his
station
in
front
of
Langham
Church
.
<EOS>
Just
as
the
clock
struck
the
hour
,
a
young
man
issued
at
a
quick
pace
from
a
cross
-
street
,
and
came
upon
the
couple
before
he
was
aware
of
it
.
<EOS>
He
was
evidently
greatly
embarrassed
,
and
would
have
beaten
a
retreat
,
but
that
was
impossible
.
<EOS>
His
embarrassment
was
in
some
degree
shared
by
the
young
lady
;
she
blushed
deeply
,
but
could
not
conceal
her
satisfaction
at
the
encounter
.
<EOS>
The
elder
individual
,
who
did
not
appear
to
notice
the
confusion
of
either
party
,
immediately
extended
his
hand
to
the
young
man
,
and
exclaimed
:
 
<EOS>
"
What
!
<EOS>
Mr.
Darcy
,
is
it
you
?
<EOS>
Why
,
we
thought
we
had
lost
you
,
sir
!
<EOS>
What
took
you
off
so
suddenly
?
<EOS>
We
have
been
expecting
you
these
four
days
,
and
were
now
walking
about
to
try
and
find
you
.
<EOS>
My
daughter
has
been
,
terrible
uneasy
.
<EOS>
Have
n't
you
,
Ebba
?
"
 
<EOS>
The
young
lady
made
no
answer
to
this
appeal
,
but
east
down
her
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
was
my
intention
to
call
,
and
give
you
an
explanation
of
my
strange
conduct
,
today
,
"
replied
Auriol
.
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
received
my
letter
,
stating
that
my
sudden
departure
was
unavoidable
.
"
 
"
To
be
sure
;
and
I
also
received
the
valuable
snuff
-
box
you
were
so
good
as
to
send
me
,
"
replied
Mr.
Thorneycroft
.
<EOS>
"
But
you
neglected
to
tell
me
how
to
acknowledge
the
gift
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
could
not
give
an
address
at
the
moment
,
"
said
Auriol
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
am
glad
to
find
you
have
got
the
use
of
your
arm
again
,
"
observed
the
iron
-
merchant
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
ca
n't
say
you
look
so
well
as
when
you
left
us
.
<EOS>
You
seem
paler
--
eh
?
<EOS>
what
do
you
think
,
Ebba
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Darcy
looks
as
if
he
were
suffering
from
mental
anxiety
rather
than
from
bodily
ailment
,
"
she
replied
,
timidly
..
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
so
,
"
replied
Auriol
,
regarding
her
fixedly
.
<EOS>
"
A
very
disastrous
circumstance
has
happened
to
me
.
<EOS>
But
answer
me
one
question
:
has
the
mysterious
person
in
the
black
cloak
troubled
you
again
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
mysterious
person
?
"
demanded
Mr.
Thorneycroft
,
opening
his
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
"
Never
mind
,
father
,
"
replied
Ebba
.
<EOS>
"
I
saw
him
last
night
,
"
she
added
to
Auriol
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
sitting
in
the
back
room
alone
,
wondering
what
had
become
of
you
,
when
I
heard
a
tap
against
the
window
,
which
was
partly
open
,
and
,
looking
up
,
I
beheld
the
tall
stranger
.
<EOS>
It
was
nearly
dark
,
but
the
light
of
the
fire
revealed
his
malignant
countenance
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
exaggerate
,
when
I
say
his
eyes
gleamed
like
those
of
a
tiger
.
<EOS>
I
was
terribly
frightened
,
but
something
prevented
me
from
crying
out
.
<EOS>
After
gazing
at
me
for
a
few
moments
,
with
a
look
that
seemed
to
fascinate
while
it
frightened
me
,
he
said--'You
desire
to
see
Auriol
Darcy
.
<EOS>
I
have
just
quitted
him
.
<EOS>
Go
to
Langham
-
place
tomorrow
,
and
,
as
the
clock
strikes
two
,
you
will
behold
him
.
'
<EOS>
Without
waiting
for
any
reply
on
my
part
,
he
disappeared
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
you
never
told
me
this
,
you
little
rogue
!
"
cried
Mr.
Thorneycroft
.
<EOS>
"
You
persuaded
me
to
come
out
with
you
,
in
the
hope
of
meeting
Mr.
Darcy
;
but
you
did
not
say
you
were
sure
to
find
him
.
<EOS>
So
you
sent
this
mysterious
gentleman
to
her
,
eh
?
"
<EOS>
he
added
to
Auriol
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
did
not
,
"
replied
the
other
,
gloomily
.
 
<EOS>
"
Indeed
!
"
exclaimed
the
iron
-
merchant
with
a
puzzled
look
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
then
I
suppose
he
thought
it
might
relieve
her
anxiety
.
<EOS>
However
,
since
we
have
met
,
I
hope
you
'll
walk
home
and
dine
with
us
.
"
 
<EOS>
Auriol
was
about
to
decline
the
invitation
,
but
Ebba
glanced
at
him
entreatingly
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
an
engagement
,
but
I
will
forgo
it
,
"
he
said
,
offering
his
arm
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
And
they
walked
along
towards
Oxford
-
street
,
while
Mr.
Thorneycroft
followed
a
few
paces
behind
them
.
 
<EOS>
"
This
is
very
kind
of
you
,
Mr.
Darcy
,
"
said
Ebba
.
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
have
been
so
wretched
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
grieve
to
hear
it
,
"
he
rejoined
.
<EOS>
"
I
hoped
you
had
forgotten
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
you
did
not
think
so
,
"
she
cried
.
 
<EOS>
As
she
spoke
,
she
felt
a
shudder
pass
through
Auriol
's
frame
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
ails
you
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
anxiously
inquired
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
would
have
shunned
you
,
if
I
could
,
Ebba
,
"
he
replied
;
"
but
a
fate
,
against
which
it
is
vain
to
contend
,
has
brought
us
together
again
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
of
it
,
"
she
replied
;
"
because
ever
since
our
last
interview
,
I
have
been
reflecting
on
what
you
then
said
to
me
,
and
am
persuaded
you
are
labouring
under
some
strange
delusion
,
occasioned
by
your
recent
accident
.
<EOS>
"
 
"
Be
not
deceived
,
Ebba
,
"
cried
Auriol
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
under
a
terrible
influence
.
<EOS>
I
need
not
remind
you
of
the
mysterious
individual
who
tapped
at
your
window
last
night
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
of
him
?
"
demanded
Ebba
,
with
a
thrill
of
apprehension
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
it
is
who
controls
my
destiny
,
"
replied
Auriol
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
what
has
he
to
do
with
me
?
"
asked
Ebba
.
 
<EOS>
"
Much
,
much
,
"
he
replied
,
with
a
perceptible
shudder
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
terrify
me
,
Auriol
,
"
she
rejoined
.
<EOS>
"
Tell
me
what
you
mean
--
in
pity
,
tell
me
?
"
 
Before
Auriol
could
reply
Mr.
Thorneycroft
stepped
forward
,
and
turned
the
conversation
into
another
channel
.
 
<EOS>
Soon
after
this
,
they
reached
the
Quadrant
,
and
were
passing
beneath
the
eastern
colonnade
,
when
Ebba
's
attention
was
attracted
towards
a
man
who
was
leading
a
couple
of
dogs
by
a
string
,
while
he
had
others
under
his
arm
,
others
again
in
his
pocket
,
and
another
in
his
breast
.
<EOS>
It
was
Mr.
Ginger
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
a
pretty
little
dog
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Ebba
,
remarking
the
Charles
the
Second
spaniel
.
 
<EOS>
"
Allow
me
to
present
you
with
it
?
"
said
Auriol
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
know
I
should
value
it
,
as
coming
from
you
,
"
she
replied
,
blushing
deeply
;
"
but
I
can
not
accept
it
;
so
I
will
not
look
at
it
again
,
for
fear
I
should
be
tempted
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
dog
-
fancier
,
however
,
noticing
Ebba
's
admiration
,
held
forward
the
spaniel
,
and
said
,
"
Do
jist
look
at
the
pretty
little
creater
,
miss
.
<EOS>
It
han't
its
equil
for
beauty
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
be
afeerd
on
it
,
miss
.
<EOS>
It
's
as
gentle
as
a
lamb
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
you
little
darling
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ebba
said
,
patting
its
sleek
head
and
long
silken
ears
,
while
it
fixed
its
large
black
eyes
upon
her
,
as
if
entreating
her
to
become
its
purchaser
.
 
<EOS>
"
Fairy
seems
to
have
taken
quite
a
fancy
to
you
miss
,
"
observed
Ginger
;
"
and
she
ai
nt
<EOS>
i
'
<EOS>
the
habit
<EOS>
o
'
fallin
'
<EOS>
i
'
love
at
first
sight
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
wonder
at
it
,
though
for
my
part
.
<EOS>
I
should
do
jist
the
same
,
if
I
wos
in
her
place
.
<EOS>
Veil
,
now
,
miss
,
as
she
seems
to
like
you
,
and
you
seem
to
like
her
<EOS>
,
I
wo
n't
copy
the
manners
o

<EOS>
them
'
ere
fathers
as
has
stony
'
arts
,
and
part
two
true
lovvers
.
<EOS>
You
shall
have
her
a
bargin
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
call
a
bargain
,
my
good
man
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Ebba
,
smiling
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
could
afford
to
give
her
to
you
,
miss
,
"
replied
Ginger
;
"
you
should
have
her
,
and
welcome
.
<EOS>
But
I
must
airn
a
livelihood
,
and
Fairy
is
the
most
wallerable
part
<EOS>
o
'
<EOS>
my
stock
.
<EOS>
I
'll
tell
you
wot
<EOS>
I
give
for
her
myself
,
and
you
shall
have
her
at
a
trifle
beyond
it
.
<EOS>
I
'd
scorn
to
take
adwantage
o
'
<EOS>
the
likes
<EOS>
o
'
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
did
n't
give
too
much
,
then
,
friend
,
"
replied
Ebba
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
give
hayf
her
wally
--
not
hayf
,
"
said
Ginger
;
"
and
if
so
be
you
do
n't
like
her
in
a
month
's
time
<EOS>

<EOS>
Ask
Mr.

the

gunmaker

Bond

street
,
about
me
--
him
as

Bond

street
--
<EOS>
an
:
he
'll
tell
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
you
have
n't
answered
the
lady
's
question
,
"
said
Auriol
.
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
ask
for
the
dog
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Do
you
want
it
for
yourself
,
sir
,
or
for
her
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Ginger
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
does
it
matter
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Auriol
,
angrily
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
great
deal
,
sir
,
"
replied
Ginger
;
"
it
'll
make
a
mater'al
difference
in
the
price
.
<EOS>
To
you
,
she
'll
be
five
-
an'-twenty
guineas
.
<EOS>
To
the
young
lady
,
twenty
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
suppose
I
buy
her
for
the
young
lady
?
"
said
Auriol
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
then
,
in
coorse
,
you
'll
get
her
at
the
lower
figure
!
"
<EOS>
replied
Ginger
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
do
n't
mean
to
buy
the
dog
?
"
interposed
Mr.
Thorneycroft
.
<EOS>
"
The
price
is
monstrous
--
preposterous
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
may
appear
so
to
you
,
sir
,
"
said
Ginger
,
"
because
you
're
<EOS>
ignorant
o
'
the
wally
of
sich
a
hanimal
<EOS>
;
but
I
can
tell
you
it
's
cheap
--
<EOS>
dirt
cheap

Vy

his

<EOS>
"
I

I

Mr.

gruffly

<EOS>
"
Eighty

said
Ginger
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Eighty

,
as
I

a

man

no

<EOS>
The

"
 
<EOS>
"
Stuff

cried
Mr.
Thorneycroft
;
"
I

to
be
gammoned
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
no

said
Ginger
.
<EOS>
"
Look

She

"
returned
Ebba
,
again
patting
the
animal
's
head
.
 
<EOS>
While
this
was
passing
,
two
men
of
very
suspicious
mien
,
ensconced
behind
a
pillar
adjoining
the
group
,
were
reconnoitring
Auriol
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
him
!
"
<EOS>
whispered
the
taller
and
darker
of
the
two
to
his
companion--"it
's
the
young
man
<EOS>

been
lookin

for

Auriol
Darcy

"
 
<EOS>
"
It
seems
like
him

said
the
other
,
edging
round
the
pillar
as
far
as
he
could
without
exposure
.
<EOS>
"
I
vish
he

<EOS>
"
It

said
the
Tinker

<EOS>
"
Ve

<EOS>
"
Vell
,
I
'll

said
Ginger
,
coaxingly
,
"

"
 
<EOS>
Auriol
,
who
had
fallen
into
a
fit
of
abstraction
,
here
remarked
:
 
"
What
's
that
you
are
saying

fellow

"
 
<EOS>
"
I
vos
a

sayin

replied
Ginger
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
then
,
I
close
with
you

<EOS>
Here
's
the

said
Auriol
,
taking
out
his
purse
.
 
<EOS>
"
On

Auriol

"
cried
Ebba
,
quickly
.
<EOS>
"
It

too
much

"
 
<EOS>
"
A
great
deal
too
much
,
Mr.
Darcy

"
said
Thorneycroft
.
 
<EOS>
"
Auriol

Darcy

"
<EOS>
muttered
Ginger
.
<EOS>
"
Can

Vere

<EOS>
Oh
,
it
's
all

"
<EOS>
he
added
,
receiving
a
signal
from
behind
the
pillar
.
<EOS>
"
They
're
on
the
look
-
out

I

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Give
the

the

take

man

"
said
Auriol
,
sharply
.
 
<EOS>
"
Beg
pardon
,
sir
,
"
said
Ginger
,
"
but
had
n't
I
better
carry
the
dog
home
for
the
young

<EOS>
It
might
meet

some
accident
in

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Accident!--stuff
and
nonsense
!
"
cried
Mr.
Thorneycroft
.
<EOS>
"
The
rascal
only
wants
to
follow
you
home
,
that
he
may
know
where
you
live
,
and
steal
the
dog
back
again
.
<EOS>
Take
my
advice
,
Mr.
Darcy
,
and
do
n't
buy
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
bargain
's
concluded
,
"
said
Ginger
,
delivering
the
dog
to
Ebba
,
and
taking
the
money
from
Auriol
,
which
,
having
counted
,
he
thrust
into
his
capacious
breeches
-
pocket
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
shall
I
thank
you
for
this
treasure
,
Auriol
?
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Ebba
,
in
an
ecstasy
of
delight
.
 
<EOS>
"
By
transferring
to
it
all
regard
you
may
entertain
for
me
,
"
he
replied
,
in
a
low
tone
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
is
impossible
,
"
she
answered
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
vote
we
drive
away
at
once
,
"
said
Mr.
Thorneycroft
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Halloa
!
<EOS>
jarvey
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
,
hailing
a
coach
that
was
passing
;
adding
,
as
the
vehicle
stopped
,
"
Now
get
in
,
Ebba
.
<EOS>
By
this
means
we
shall
avoid
being
followed
by
the
rascal
.
"
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
got
into
the
coach
.
<EOS>
As
Auriol
was
about
to
follow
him
,
he
felt
a
slight
touch
on
his
arm
,
and
,
turning
,
beheld
a
tall
and
very
forbidding
man
by
his
side
.
 
<EOS>
"
Beg
pardin
,
sir
,
"
said
the
fellow
,
touching
his
hat
,
"
but
ai
n't
your
name
Mr.
Auriol
Darcy
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
,
"
replied
Auriol
,
regarding
him
fixedly
.
<EOS>
"
Why
do
you
ask
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I

replied
the
Tinker
.
 
<EOS>
"
Say
what
you
have
to
say
at
once
,
"
rejoined
Auriol
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
nothing
of
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
'll
know
me
better
by
-
and
-
by
sir
,
"
said
the
Tinker
,
in
a
significant
tone
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
speak
to
you
,
and
alone
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
If
you
do
n't
go
about
your
business

fellow

instantly
,
I
'll
give
you
in

"
cried
Auriol
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
you
von't
sir
--
no
you
von't
,
"
replied
the
Tinker
,
shaking
his
head
.
<EOS>
And
then
,
lowering
his
voice
,
he
added
,
"
You
'll
be
glad
to

<EOS>
"
Wo

Mr.
Darcy

"
<EOS>
cried
Thorneycroft
,
whose
back
was
towards
the
Tinker
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
speak
to
this
man
,
"
replied
Auriol
,
"
I
'll
come
to
you
in
the
evening
.
<EOS>
Till
then
,
farewell
,
Ebba
.
"
<EOS>
And
,
as
the
coach
drove
away
,
he
added
to
the
Tinker
,
"
Now
,
rascal
,
what
have
you
to
say
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Step
this
vay

replied
the
Tinker
.
<EOS>
"
There

VII

<EOS>
THE
HAND
,
AGAIN
!
 
<EOS>
Followed
by
Auriol
,
who
,
in
his
turn
,
was
followed
by
Ginger
and
the
Sandman
,
the
Tinker
directed
his
steps
to
Great
Windmill
-
street
;
where
he
entered
a
public
-
house
,
called
the
Black
Lion
.
<EOS>
Leaving
his
four-
footed
attendants
with
the
landlord
,
with
whom
he
was
acquainted
,
Ginger
caused
the
party
to
be
shown
into
a
private
room
,
and
,
on
entering
it
,
Auriol
flung
himself
into
a
chair
,
while
the
dog
--
fancier
stationed
himself
near
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
what
do
you
want
with
me
?
"
demanded
Auriol
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
shall
learn
presently
,
"
replied
the
Tinker
;
"
but
first
,
it
may
be
as
vell
to
state
,
that
a
certain
pocket
-
book
has
been
found
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ah

"
exclaimed
Auriol
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
the
villains
who
beset
me
in
the
ruined
house
in
the
Vauxhall

road

"
 
<EOS>
"
Your
pocket
-
book
has
been
found
,
I
tell
you
,
"
replied
the
Tinker
,
"
and
from
it
ve
have
made
the
most
awful
diskiveries
.
<EOS>
Our
werry
'
air
stood
on

<EOS>
ven

first
read

<EOS>
What

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Hangin

cried
the
Sandman
;
"
but
if

<EOS>
"
I
hope

"
said
Ginger
.
 
<EOS>
"
Peace
!
"
thundered
Auriol
.
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
require
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
A
hundred
pound
each'll
buy
our
silence

"
replied
the
Tinker
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ve

to
have

said
the
Sandman
,
"
for
screenin

<EOS>
"
Ve
do

said
Ginger
.
 
<EOS>
"
You

,
"
pursued
the
Tinker
,
"
<EOS>
that
ve
ai
nt
'
perfectly
acvainted
with
your
history
,
but
to
prove
that
ve
are
,
I
'll
just
rub
up
your
memory
.
<EOS>
Did
you
ever
hear
tell
of
a
gemman
as
murdered
Doctor
Lamb
,
the
famous
halchemist
o
'
<EOS>
Queen
Bess
's
time
,
and
,
havin'
drank
the
'
lixir
vich
the
doctor

made
for

,
has
lived
ever
since
?
<EOS>
Did
you
ever
hear
tell
of
such
a
person
,
I
say
?
"
 
<EOS>
Auriol
gazed
at
him
in
astonishment
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
idle
tale
are
you
inventing
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
at
length
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
no
idle
tale
,
"
replied
the
Tinker
,
boldly
.
<EOS>
"
Ve
can
bring
a
vitness
as'll
prove
the
fact
--
a
livin
'
vitness
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
witness
?
"
cried
Auriol
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
you
rekilect
the
dwarf
as
used
to
serve
Doctor
Lamb
?
"
rejoined
the
Tinker
.
<EOS>
"
He
's
alive
still
;
and
ve
calls
him
Old
Parr
,
on
account
of
his
great
age
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Where
is
he?--what
has
become
of
him
?
"
demanded
Auriol
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
ve'll
preduce
him
in
doo
time
,
"
replied
the
Tinker
,
cunningly
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
tell
me
where
the
poor
fellow
is
?
"
cried
Auriol
.
"
<EOS>
Have
you
seen
him
since
last
night
?
<EOS>
I
sent
him
to
a
public
-
house
at
Kensington
,
but
he
has
disappeared
from
it
,
and
I
can
discover
no
traces
of
him
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
'll
turn
up
somewhere
--
never
fear
,
"
rejoined
the
Tinker
"
<EOS>
But
now
,
sir
,
that
ve
fairly
understands
each
other
,
are
you
agreeable
to
our

<EOS>
You

an

not

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
pocket

book
must
be
delivered
up
to
me
if
I
assent
,
"
said
Auriol
,
"
and
the
poor

must
be
found
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Vy
,
as
to
that
,
I
can
scarcely
promise

"
replied
the
Tinker
;
"
there
's
a
difficulty
in
the
case

you
see

<EOS>
But
the
pocket

never

you

it
,
or
you
get
nothing
from
me

"
cried
Auriol
.
 
<EOS>
"
Here
's
a
bit
o
'
paper
as
come
from
the
pocket
-
book
,
"
said
Ginger
.
<EOS>
"
Would
you
like
to
hear
wot
's
written
upon
it
?
<EOS>
Here
are
the
words:--
'
How
many
crimes
have
I
to
reproach
myself
with
!
<EOS>
How
many
innocents
have
I
destroyed
!
<EOS>
And
all
owing
to
my
fatal
compact
with---
"
 
"
Give
me
that
paper
,
"
cried
Auriol
,
rising
and
attempting
to
snatch
it
from
the
dog
-
fancier
.
 
<EOS>
Just
at
this
moment
,
and
while
Ginger
retreated
from
Auriol
,
the
door
behind
him
was
noiselessly
opened
--
a
hand
was
thrust
through
the
chink
--
and
the
paper
was
snatched
from
his
grasp
.
<EOS>
Before
Ginger
could
turn
round
,
the
door
was
closed
again
.
 
<EOS>
"
Halloa
!
<EOS>
What
's
that
?
"
<EOS>
he
cried
.
<EOS>
"
The
paper
's
gone
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
hand
again
!
"
cried
the
Sandman
,
in
alarm
.
<EOS>
"
See
who
's
in
the
passage
--
open
the
door
--
quick
!
"
 
<EOS>
Ginger
cautiously
complied
and
,
peeping
forth
,
said
:
 
"
There
's
no
one
there
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
the
devil
.
<EOS>
I
'll
have
nuffin
'
more
to
do
wi
'
the
matter
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Poh
!
<EOS>
poh
!
<EOS>
do
n't
be
so
chicken-'arted
!
"
cried
the
Tinker
.
"
<EOS>
But
come
what
may
,
the
gemman
sha'n't
stir
till
he
undertakes
to
pay
us
three
hundred
pounds
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
seek
to
frighten
me
in
vain
,
villain
,
"
cried
Auriol
,
upon
whom
the
recent
occurrence
had
not
been
lost
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
but
to
stamp
my
foot
,
and
I
can
instantly
bring
assistance
that
shall
overpower
you
.
<EOS>
"
 
"
Do
n't
provoke
him
,
"
whispered
Ginger
,
plucking
the
Tinker
's
sleeve
.
"
For
my
part
,
I
sha
n't
stay
any
longer
.
<EOS>
I
would
n't
take
his
money
.
"
<EOS>
And
he
quitted
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'll
go
and
see
wot
's
the
matter
<EOS>
wi
'
Ginger
,
"
said
the
Sandman
slinking
after
him
.
 
<EOS>
The
Tinker
looked
nervously
round
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
proof
against
his
superstitious
fears
.
 
<EOS>
"
Here
,
take
this
purse
,
and
trouble
me
no
more
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Auriol
.
<EOS>
The
Tinker
's
hands
clutched
the
purse
mechanically
,
but
he
instantly
laid
it
down
again
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'm
bad
enough
--
but
I
wo
n't
sell
myseff
to
the
devil
,
"
he
said
.
 
<EOS>
And
he
followed
his
companions
.
 
<EOS>
Left
alone
,
Auriol
groaned
aloud
,
and
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
.
<EOS>
When
he
looked
up
,
he
found
the
tall
man
in
the
black
cloak
standing
beside
him
.
<EOS>
A
demoniacal
smile
played
upon
his
features
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
here
?
"
cried
Auriol
.
 
<EOS>
"
Of
course
,
"
replied
the
stranger
.
<EOS>
"
I
came
to
watch
over
your
safety
.
<EOS>
You
were
in
danger
from
those
men
.
<EOS>
But
you
need
not
concern
yourself
more
about
them
.
<EOS>
I
have
your
pocket
-
book
,
and
the
slip
of
paper
that
dropped
from
it
.
<EOS>
Here
are
both
.
<EOS>
Now
let
us
talk
on
other
matters
.
<EOS>
You
have
just
parted
from
Ebba
,
and
will
see
her
again
this
evening
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Perchance
,
"
replied
Auriol
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
will
,
"
rejoined
the
stranger
,
peremptorily
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Remember
,
your
ten
years
'
limit
draws
to
a
close
.
<EOS>
In
a
few
days
it
will
be
at
an
end
;
and
if
you
renew
it
not
,
you
will
incur
the
penalty
,
and
you
know
it
to
be
terrible
.
<EOS>
With
the
means
of
renewal
in
your
hands
,
why
hesitate
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Because
I
will
not
sacrifice
the
girl
,
"
replied
Auriol
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
can
not
help
yourself
,
"
cried
the
stranger
,
scornfully
.
<EOS>
"
I
command
you
to
bring
her
to
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
persist
in
my
refusal
,
"
replied
Auriol
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
useless
to
brave
my
power
,
"
said
the
stranger
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
moon
is
just
born
.
<EOS>
When
it
has
attained
its
first
quarter
,
Ebba
shall
be
mine
.
<EOS>
Till
then
,
farewell
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
as
the
words
were
uttered
,
he
passed
through
the
door
.

THE
BARBER
OF
LONDON
 
<EOS>
Who
has
not
heard
of
the
Barber
of
London
?
<EOS>
His
dwelling
is
in
the
neighbourhood
of
Lincoln
's
Inn
.
<EOS>
It
is
needless
to
particularize
the
street
,
for
everybody
knows
the
shop
;
that
is
to
say
,
every
member
of
the
legal
profession
,
high
or
low
.
<EOS>
All
,
to
the
very
judges
themselves
,
have
their
hair
cut
,
or
their
wigs
dressed
by
him
.
<EOS>
A
pleasant
fellow
is
Mr.
Tuffnell
Trigge
--
<EOS>
Figaro
himself
not
pleasanter
--
and
if
you
do
not
shave
yourself
--
if
you
want
a
becoming
flow
imparted
to
your
stubborn
locks
,
or
if
you
require
a
wig
,
I
recommend
you
to
the
care
of
Mr.
Tuffnell
Trigge
.
<EOS>
Not
only
will
he
treat
you
well
,
but
he
will
regale
you
with
all
the
gossip
of
the
court
;
he
will
give
you
the
last
funny
thing
of
Mr.
Serjeant
Larkins
;
he
will
tell
you
how
many
briefs
the
great
Mr.
Skinner
Fyne
receives
--
what
the
Vice
-
Chancellor
is
doing
;
and
you
will
own
,
on
rising
that
have
never
spent
a
five
minutes
more
agreeably
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
you
are
likely
to
see
some
noticeable
characters
,
for
Mr.
Trigge
's
shop
is
quite
a
lounge
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
you
may
find
a
young
barrister
who
has
just
been
"
called
"
,
ordering
his
"
first
wig
"
,
and
you
may
hear
the
prognostications
of
Mr.
Trigge
to
his
future
distinction
.
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
sir
,
"
he
will
say
,
glancing
at
the
stolid
features
of
the
young
man
,
"
you
have
quite
the
face
of
the
Chief
Justice
--
quite
the
face
of
the
chief
--
I
do
n't
recollect
him
ordering
his
first
wig
<EOS>
--
that
was
a
little
before
my
time
;
but
I
hope
to
live
to
see
you
chief
,
sir
.
<EOS>
Quite
within
your
reach
,
if
you
choose
to
apply
.
<EOS>
Sure
of
it
,
sir
--
quite
sure
.
<EOS>
"
Or
you
may
see
him
attending
to
some
grave
master
in
Chancery
,
and
listening
with
profound
attention
to
his
remarks
;
or
screaming
with
laughter
at
the
jokes
of
some
smart
special
pleader
;
or
talking
of
the
theatres
,
the
actors
and
actresses
,
to
some
young
attorneys
,
or
pupils
in
conveyancers
'
chambers
;
for
those
are
the
sort
of
customers
in
whom
Mr.
Trigge
chiefly
delights
;
with
them
,
indeed
,
he
is
great
,
for
it
is
by
them
he
has
been
dubbed
the
Barber
of
London
.
<EOS>
His
shop
is
also
frequented
by
managing
clerks
,
barristers
'
clerks
,
engrossing
clerks
and
others
;
but
these
are
,
for
the
most
part
,
his
private
friends
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Trigge
's
shop
is
none
of
your
spruce
West
end
hair
-
cutting
establishments
,
with
magnificent
mirrors
on
every
side
,
in
which
you
may
see
the
back
of
your
head
,
the
front
,
and
the
side
,
all
at
once
,
with
walls
bedizened
with
glazed
French
paper
,
and
with
an
ante
-
room
full
of
bears'-grease
,
oils
,
creams
,
tooth
-
powders
,
and
cut
glass
.
<EOS>
No
,
it
is
a
real
barber
's
and
hairdresser
's
shop
,
of
the
good
old
stamp
,
where
you
may
get
cut
and
curled
for
a
shilling
,
and
shaved
for
half
the
price
.
 
<EOS>
True
,
the
floor
is
not
covered
with
a
carpet
.
<EOS>
But
what
of
that
?
<EOS>
It
bears
the
imprint
of
innumerable
customers
,
and
is
scattered
over
with
their
hair
.
<EOS>
In
the
window
,
there
is
an
assortment
of
busts
moulded
in
wax
,
exhibiting
the
triumphs
of
Mr.
Trigge
's
art
;
and
,
above
these
,
are
several
specimens
of
legal
wigs
.
<EOS>
On
the
little
counter
behind
the
window
,
amid
large
pots
of
pommade
,
and
bears'-grease
,
and
the
irons
and
brushes
in
constant
use
by
the
barber
,
are
other
bustos
,
done
to
the
life
,
and
for
ever
glancing
amiably
into
the
room
.
<EOS>
On
the
block
is
a
judge
's
wig
,
which
Mr.
Trigge
has
just
been
dressing
,
and
a
little
farther
,
on
a
higher
block
,
is
that
of
a
counsel
.
<EOS>
On
either
side
of
the
fireplace
are
portraits
of
Lord
Eldon
and
Lord
Lyndhurst
.
<EOS>
Some
other
portraits
of
pretty
actresses
are
likewise
to
be
seen
.
<EOS>
Against
the
counter
rests
a
board
,
displaying
the
playbill
of
the
evening
;
and
near
it
is
a
large
piece
of
emblematical
crockery
,
indicating
that
bears'-grease
may
be
had
on
the
premises
.
<EOS>
Amongst
Mr.
Trigge
's
live-
stock
may
be
enumerated
his
favourite
magpie
,
placed
in
a
wicker
cage
in
the
window
,
which
chatters
incessantly
,
and
knows
everything
its
master
avouches
,
"
as
well
as
a
Christian
"
.
 
<EOS>
And
now
as
to
Mr.
Tuffnell
Trigge
himself
.
<EOS>
He
is
very
tall
and
very
thin
,
and
holds
himself
so
upright
that
he
loses
not
an
inch
of
his
stature
.
<EOS>
His
head
is
large
and
his
face
long
,
with
marked
,
if
not
very
striking
features
,
charged
<EOS>
,
it
must
be
admitted
with
a
very
self-
satisfied
expression
.
<EOS>
One
can
not
earn
the
appellation
of
the
Barber
of
London
without
talent
;
and
it
is
the
consciousness
of
this
talent
that
lends
to
Mr.
Trigge
's
features
their
apparently
conceited
expression
.
<EOS>
A
fringe
of
black
whisker
adorns
his
cheek
and
chin
,
and
his
black
bristly
hair
is
brushed
back
,
so
as
to
exhibit
the
prodigious
expanse
of
his
forehead
.
<EOS>
His
eyebrows
are
elevated
,
as
if
in
constant
scorn
.
 
<EOS>
The
attire
in
which
Mr.
Trigge
is
ordinarily
seen
,
consists
of
a
black
velvet
waistcoat
,
and
tight
black
continuations
.
<EOS>
These
are
protected
by
a
white
apron
tied
round
his
waist
,
with
pockets
to
hold
his
scissors
and
combs
;
over
all
,
he
wears
a
short
nankeen
jacket
,
into
the
pockets
of
which
his
hands
are
constantly
thrust
when
not
otherwise
employed
.
<EOS>
A
black
satin
stock
with
a
large
bow
encircles
his
throat
,
and
his
shirt
is
fastened
by
black
enamel
studs
.
<EOS>
Such
is
Mr.
Tuffnell
Trigge
,
yclept
the
Barber
of
London
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
time
of
his
introduction
to
the
reader
,
Mr.
Trigge
had
just
advertised
for
an
assistant
,
his
present
young
man
,
Rutherford
Watts
,
being
about
to
leave
him
,
and
set
up
for
himself
in
Canterbury
.
<EOS>
It
was
about
two
o'clock
,
and
Mr.
Trigge
had
just
withdrawn
into
an
inner
room
to
take
some
refection
,
when
,
on
returning
,
he
found
Watts
occupied
in
cutting
the
hair
of
a
middle
-
aged
,
sour
-
looking
gentleman
,
who
was
seated
before
the
fire
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Trigge
bowed
to
the
sour
-
looking
gentleman
,
and
appeared
ready
to
enter
into
conversation
with
him
,
but
no
notice
being
taken
of
his
advances
,
he
went
and
talked
to
his
magpie
.
 
<EOS>
While
he
was
chattering
to
it
,
the
sagacious
bird
screamed
forth
:
"
Pretty
dear!--pretty
dear
!
"
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
what
's
that
?
<EOS>
Who
is
it
?
<EOS>
"
cried
Trigge
.
 
<EOS>
"
Pretty
dear!--pretty
dear
!
"
reiterated
the
magpie
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
this
,
Trigge
looked
around
,
and
saw
a
very
singular
little
man
enter
the
shop
.
<EOS>
He
had
somewhat
the
appearance
of
a
groom
being
clothed
in
a
long
grey
coat
,
drab
knees
,
and
small
top
-
boots
.
<EOS>
He
had
a
large
and
remarkable
projecting
mouth
,
like
that
of
a
baboon
,
and
a
great
shock
head
of
black
hair
.
 
<EOS>
"
Pretty
dear!--pretty
dear
!
"
screamed
the
magpie
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
see
nothing
pretty
about
him
,
"
thought
Mr.
Trigge
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
a
strange
fellow
.
<EOS>
It
would
puzzle
the
Lord
Chancellor
himself
to
say
what
his
age
might
be
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
little
man
took
off
his
hat
,
and
making
a
profound
bow
to
the
barber
,
unfolded
the
Times
newspaper
,
which
he
carried
under
his
arm
,
and
held
it
up
to
Trigge
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
want
,
my
little
friend
,
eh
?
"
said
the
barber
.
 
<EOS>
"
High
wages!--high
wages
!
"
screamed
the
magpie
.
 
<EOS>
"
Is
this
yours
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
replied
the
little
man
,
pointing
to
an
advertisement
in
the
newspaper
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
yes
,
that
's
my
advertisement
,
friend
,
"
replied
Mr.
Trigge
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
what
of
it
?
"
 
<EOS>
Before
the
little
man
could
answer
a
slight
interruption
occurred
.
<EOS>
While
eyeing
the
newcomer
,
Watts
neglected
to
draw
forth
the
hot
curling
-
irons
,
in
consequence
of
which
he
burnt
the
sour
-
looking
gentleman
's
forehead
and
singed
his
hair
.
 
<EOS>
"
Take
care
,
sir
!
"
cried
the
gentleman
,
furiously
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
the
devil
are
you
about
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
!
take
care
,
sir
,
as
Judge
Learmouth
observes
to
a
saucy
witness
,
"
cried
Trigge--"'take
care
,
or
I
'll
commit
you
!
'
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
D
--
n
Judge
Learmouth
!
"
cried
the
gentleman
,
angrily
.
<EOS>
"
If
I
were
a
judge
,
I
'd
hang
such
a
careless
fellow
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Sarve
him
right
!
"
<EOS>
screamed
Mag--"sarve
him
right
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Beg
pardon
,
sir
,
"
cried
Watts
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
rectify
you
in
a

"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
my
little
friend
,
"
observed
Trigge
,
"
and
what
may
be
your
object
in
coming
to
me
,
as
the
great
conveyancer
,
Mr.
Plodwell
,
observes
to
his
clients
--
what
may
be
your
object
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
want
an
assistant
,
do
n't
you
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
rejoined
the
little
man
,
humbly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
you
apply
on
your
own
account
,
or
on
behalf
of
a
friend
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Trigge
.
 
<EOS>
"
On
my
own
,
"
replied
the
little
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
are
your
qualifications
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
Trigge--"what
are
your
qualifications
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
fancy
I
understand
something
of
the
business
,
"
replied
the
little
man
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
a
perruquier
myself
,
when
wigs
were
more
in
fashion
than
they
are
now
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ha
!
indeed
!
"
said
Trigge
,
laughing
.
<EOS>
"
That
must
have
been
in
the
last
century
--
in
Queen
Anne
's
time
--
eh
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
hit
it
exactly
,
sir
,
"
replied
the
little
man
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
in
Queen
Anne
's
time
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
you
recollect
when
wigs
were
first
worn
,
my
little
Nestor
,
"
cried
Mr.
Trigge
.
 
<EOS>
"
Perfectly
,
"
replied
the
little
man
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
French
periwigs
were
first
worn
in
Charles
the
Second
's
time
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
saw
'em
,
of
course
?
"
cried
the
barber
,
with
a
sneer
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
did
,
"
replied
the
little
man
,
quietly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
he
must
be
out
of
his
mind
,
"
cried
Trigge
.
<EOS>
"
We
shall
have
a
commission
de
lunatico
to
issue
here
,
as
the
Master
of
the
Rolls
would
observe
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
hope
I
may
suit
you
,
sir
,
"
said
the
little
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
you
will
,
my
friend
,
"
replied
Mr.
Trigge
;
"
I
do
n't
think
you
will
.
<EOS>
You
do
n't
seem
to
have
a
hand
for
hair
-
dressing
.
<EOS>
Are
you
aware
of
the
talent
the
art
requires
?
<EOS>
Are
you
aware
what
it
has
cost
me
to
earn
the
enviable
title
of
the
Barber
of
London
?
<EOS>
I
'm
as
proud
of
that
title
as
if
I
were---
<EOS>
"
 
"
Lord
Chancellor!--Lord
Chancellor
!
"
screamed
Mag
.
 
<EOS>
"
Precisely
,
Mag
,
"
said
Mr.
Trigge
;
"
as
if
I
were
Lord
Chancellor
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
'm
sorry
for
it
,
"
said
the
little
man
,
disconsolately
.
 
<EOS>
"
Pretty
dear
!
"
<EOS>
screamed
Mag
;
<EOS>
"
pretty
dear
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
a
wonderful
bird
you
have
got
!
"
said
the
sour
-
looking
gentleman
,
rising
and
paying
Mr.
Trigge
.
<EOS>
"
I
declare
its
answers
are
quite
appropriate
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
Mag
is
a
clever
creature
,
sir
--
that
she
is
,
"
replied
the
barber
.
<EOS>
"
I
gave
a
good
deal
for
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Little
or
nothing
!
"
screamed
Mag--"little
or
nothing
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
is
your
name
,
friend
?
"
said
the
gentleman
,
addressing
the
little
man
,
who
still
lingered
in
the
shop
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
sir
,
I
've
had
many
names
in
my
time
,
"
he
replied
.
<EOS>
"
At
one
time
I
was
called
Flapdragon
--
at
another
,
Old
Parr
--
but
my
real
name
,
I
believe
,
is
Morse
--
Gregory
Morse
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
An
Old
Bailey
answer
,
"
cried
Mr.
Trigge
,
shaking
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
Flapdragon
,
alias
Old
Parr
--
alias
Gregory
Morse
--
<EOS>
alias---
"
 
"
Pretty
dear
!
"
<EOS>
screamed
Mag
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
you
want
a
place
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
the
sour
-
looking
gentleman
,
eyeing
him
narrowly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Sadly
,
"
replied
Morse
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
then
,
follow
me
,
"
said
the
gentleman
,
"
and
I
'll
see
what
can
be
done
for
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
they
left
the
shop
together

<EOS>
THE
MOON
IN
THE
FIRST
QUARTER
 
IN
spite
of
his
resolution
to
the
contrary
,
Auriol
found
it
impossible
to
resist
the
fascination
of
Ebba
's
society
,
and
became
a
daily
visitor
at
her
father
's
house
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Thorneycroft
noticed
the
growing
attachment
between
them
with
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
His
great
wish
was
to
see
his
daughter
united
to
the
husband
of
her
choice
,
and
in
the
hope
of
smoothing
the
way
,
he
let
Auriol
understand
that
he
should
give
her
a
considerable
marriage
-
portion
.
 
<EOS>
For
the
last
few
days
a
wonderful
alteration
had
taken
place
in
Auriol
's
manner
,
and
he
seemed
to
have
shaken
off
altogether
the
cloud
that
had
hitherto
sat
upon
his
spirits
.
<EOS>
Enchanted
by
the
change
,
Ebba
indulged
in
the
most
blissful
anticipations
of
the
future
.
 
<EOS>
One
evening
they
walked
forth
together
,
and
almost
unconsciously
directed
their
steps
towards
the
river
.
<EOS>
Lingering
on
its
banks
,
they
gazed
on
the
full
tide
,
admired
the
glorious
sunset
,
and
breathed
over
and
over
again
those
tender
nothings
so
eloquent
in
lovers
'
ears
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
how
different
you
are
from
what
you
were
a
week
ago
,
"
said
Ebba
,
playfully
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Promise
me
not
to
indulge
in
any
more
of
those
gloomy
fancies
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
indulge
in
them
if
I
can
help
it
,
rest
assured
,
sweet
Ebba
,
"
he
replied
.
<EOS>
"
But
my
spirits
are
not
always
under
my
control
.
<EOS>
I
am
surprised
at
my
own
cheerfulness
this
evening
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
never
felt
so
happy
,
"
she
replied
;
"
and
the
whole
scene
is
in
unison
with
my
feelings
.
<EOS>
How
soothing
is
the
calm
river
flowing
at
our
feet!--how
tender
is
the
warm
sky
,
still
flushed
with
red
,
though
the
sun
has
set
!
<EOS>
And
see
,
yonder
hangs
the
crescent
moon
.
<EOS>
She
is
in
her
first
quarter
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
moon
in
her
first
quarter
!
"
cried
Auriol
,
in
a
tone
of
anguish
.
<EOS>
"
All
then
is
over
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
means
this
sudden
change
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Ebba
,
frightened
by
his
looks
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Ebba
,
"
he
replied
,
"
I
must
leave
you
.
<EOS>
I
have
allowed
myself
to
dream
of
happiness
too
long
.
<EOS>
I
am
an
accursed
being
,
doomed
only
to
bring
misery
upon
those
who
love
me
.
<EOS>
I
warned
you
on
the
onset
,
but
you
would
not
believe
me
.
<EOS>
Let
me
go
,
and
perhaps
it
may
not
yet
be
too
late
to
save
you
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
no
,
do
not
leave
me
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Ebba
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
fear
while
you
are
with
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
you
do
not
know
the
terrible
fate
I
am
linked
to
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
This
is
the
night
when
it
will
be
accomplished
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Your
moody
fancies
do
not
alarm
me
as
they
used
to
do
,
dear
Auriol
,
"
she
rejoined
,
"
because
I
know
them
to
be
the
fruit
of
a
diseased
imagination
.
<EOS>
Come
,
let
us
continue
our
walk
,
"
she
added
,
taking
his
arm
kindly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ebba
,
"
he
cried
,
"
I
implore
you
to
let
me
go
!
<EOS>
I
have
not
the
power
to
tear
myself
away
unless
you
aid
me
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
'm
glad
to
hear
it
,
"
she
rejoined
,
"
for
then
I
shall
hold
you
fast
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
know
not
what
you
do
!
"
cried
Auriol
.
<EOS>
"
Release
me
!
<EOS>
oh
,
release
me
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
In
a
few
moments
the
fit
will
be
passed
,
"
she
rejoined
.
<EOS>
"
Let
us
walk
towards
the
abbey
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
in
vain
to
struggle
against
fate
,
"
ejaculated
Auriol
,
despairingly
.
 
<EOS>
And
he
suffered
himself
to
be
led
in
the
direction
proposed
.
 
<EOS>
Ebba
continued
to
talk
,
but
her
discourse
fell
upon
a
deaf
ear
,
and
at
last
she
became
silent
too
.
<EOS>
In
this
way
they
proceeded
along
Millbank-
street
and
Abingdon
-
street
,
until
,
turning
off
on
the
right
,
they
found
themselves
before
an
old
and
partly
demolished
building
.
<EOS>
By
this
time
it
had
become
quite
dark
,
for
the
moon
was
hidden
behind
a
rack
of
clouds
,
but
a
light
was
seen
in
the
upper
storey
of
the
structure
,
occasioned
,
no
doubt
,
by
a
fire
within
it
,
which
gave
a
very
picturesque
effect
to
the
broken
outline
of
the
walls
.
 
<EOS>
Pausing
for
a
moment
to
contemplate
the
ruin
,
Ebba
expressed
a
wish
to
enter
it
.
<EOS>
Auriol
offered
no
opposition
,
and
passing
through
an
arched
doorway
,
and
ascending
a
short
,
spiral
,
stone
staircase
,
they
presently
arrived
at
a
roofless
chamber
,
which
it
was
evident
,
from
the
implements
and
rubbish
lying
about
,
was
about
to
be
razed
to
the
ground
.
<EOS>
On
one
side
there
was
a
large
arch
,
partly
bricked
up
,
through
which
opened
a
narrow
doorway
,
though
at
some
height
from
the
ground
;
With
this
a
plank
communicated
,
while
beneath
it
lay
a
great
heap
of
stones
,
amongst
which
were
some
grotesque
carved
heads
.
<EOS>
In
the
centre
of
the
chamber
was
a
large
square
opening
,
like
the
mouth
of
a
trapdoor
,
from
which
the
top
of
a
ladder
projected
,
and
near
it
stood
a
flaming
brazier
,
which
had
cast
forth
the
glare
seen
from
below
.
<EOS>
Over
the
ruinous
walls
on
the
right
hung
the
crescent
moon
,
now
emerged
from
the
cloud
,
and
shedding
a
ghostly
glimmer
on
the
scene
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
a
strange
place
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Ebba
,
gazing
around
with
some
apprehension
.
<EOS>
"
It
looks
like
a
spot
one
reads
of
in
romance
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
where
that
trap
leads
to
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Into
the
vault
beneath
,
no
doubt
,
"
replied
Auriol
.
<EOS>
"
But
why
did
we
come
hither
?
"
 
<EOS>
As
he
spoke
,
there
was
a
sound
like
mocking
laughter
,
but
whence
arising
it
was
difficult
to
say
.
 
<EOS>
"
Did
you
hear
that
sound
?
"
cried
Auriol
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
was
nothing
but
the
echo
of
laughter
from
the
street
,
"
she
replied
.
<EOS>
"
You
alarm
yourself
without
reason
,
Auriol
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
not
without
reason
,
"
he
cried
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
in
the
power
of
a
terrible
being
,
who
seeks
to
destroy
you
,
and
I
know
that
he
is
at
hand
.
<EOS>
Listen
to
me
,
Ebba
,
and
however
strange
<EOS>
my
recital
may
appear
,
do
not
suppose
it
the
ravings
of
a
madman
,
but
be
assured
it
is
the
truth
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Beware
!
"
cried
a
deep
voice
,
issuing
apparently
from
the
depths
of
the
vault
.
 
<EOS>
"
Some
one
spoke
,
"
cried
Ebba
.
<EOS>
"
I
begin
to
share
your
apprehensions
;
Let
us
quit
this
place
.
"
<EOS>
"
Come
,
then
,
"
said
Auriol
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
so
fast
,
"
cried
a
deep
voice
.
 
<EOS>
And
they
beheld
the
mysterious
owner
of
the
black
cloak
barring
their
passage
out
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ebba
,
you
are
mine
,
"
cried
the
stranger
.
<EOS>
"
Auriol
has
brought
you
to
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
false
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Auriol
.
<EOS>
"
I
never
will
yield
her
to
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Remember
your
compact
,
"
rejoined
the
stranger
,
with
a
mocking
laugh
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Auriol
!
"
cried
Ebba
,
"
I
fear
for
your
soul
.
<EOS>
You
have
not
made
a
compact
with
this
fiend
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
has
,
"
replied
the
stranger
;
"
and
by
that
compact
you
are
surrendered
to
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
,
as
he
spoke
,
he
advanced
towards
her
,
and
enveloping
her
in
his
cloak
,
her
cries
were
instantly
stifled
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
shall
not
go
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Auriol
,
seizing
him
.
"
<EOS>
Release
her
,
or
I
renounce
you
wholly
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Fool
!
"
cried
the
stranger
,
"
since
you
provoke
my
wrath
,
take
your
doom
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
he
stamped
on
the
ground
.
<EOS>
At
this
signal
an
arm
was
thrust
from
the
trap
-
door
,
and
Auriol
's
hand
was
seized
with
an
iron
grasp
.
 
<EOS>
While
this
took
place
,
the
stranger
bore
his
lovely
burden
swiftly
up
the
plank
leading
to
the
narrow
doorway
in
the
wall
,
and
just
as
he
was
passing
through
it
he
pointed
towards
the
sky
,
and
shouted
with
a
mocking
smile
to
Auriol---
 
"
Behold
!
<EOS>
the
moon
is
in
her
first
quarter
.
<EOS>
My
words
are
fulfilled
!
"
 
<EOS>
And
he
disappeared
.
 
<EOS>
Auriol
tried
to
disengage
himself
from
the
grasp
imposed
upon
him
in
vain
.
<EOS>
Uttering
ejaculations
of
rage
and
despair
,
he
was
dragged
forcibly
backwards
into
the
vault
.

<EOS>
THE
STATUE
AT
<EOS>
CHARING
-
CROSS
 
<EOS>
ONE
morning
,
two
persons
took
their
way
along
Parliament
-
street
and
Whitehall
,
and
,
chatting
as
they
walked
,
turning
into
the
entrance
of
Spring
-
gardens
,
for
the
purpose
of
looking
at
the
statue
at
Charing-
cross
.
<EOS>
One
of
them
was
remarkable
for
his
dwarfish
stature
and
strange
withered
features
.
<EOS>
The
other
was
a
man
of
middle
size
,
thin
,
rather
elderly
,
and
with
a
sharp
countenance
,
the
sourness
of
which
was
redeemed
by
a
strong
expression
of
benevolence
He
was
clad
in
a
black
coat
,
rather
rusty
,
but
well
brushed
,
buttoned
up
to
the
chin
,
black
tights
,
short
drab
gaiters
,
and
wore
a
white
neckcloth
and

Mr.
Loftus
(
for
so
he
was
called
)
was
a
retired
merchant
of
moderate
fortune
,
and
lived
in
Abingdon
-
street
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
bachelor
,
and
therefore
pleased
himself
;
and
being
a
bit
of
an
antiquary
,
rambled
about
all
day
long
in
search
of
some
object
of
interest
.
<EOS>
His
walk
,
on
the
present
occasion
,
was
taken
with
that
view
.
 
<EOS>
"
By
Jove
!
<EOS>
what
a
noble
statue
that
is
,
Morse
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Loftus
,
gazing
at
it
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
horse
is
magnificent
--
positively
magnificent
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
recollect
when
the
spot
was
occupied
by
a
gibbet
,
and
when
,
in
lieu
of
a
statue
,
an
effigy
of
the
martyred
monarch
was
placed
there
,
"
replied
Morse
.
<EOS>
"
That
was
in
the
time
of
the
Protectorate
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
can
not
get
those
dreams
out
of
your
head
,
Morse
,
"
said
Loftus
,
smiling
.
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
could
persuade
myself
I
had
lived
for
two
centuries
and
a
half
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Would
you
could
have
seen
the
ancient
cross
,
which
once
stood
there
,
erected
by
Edward
the
First
to
his
beloved
wife
,
Eleanor
of
Castile
,
"
said
Morse
,
heedless
of
the
other
's
remark
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
much
mutilated
when
I
remember
it
;
some
of
the
pinnacles
were
broken
,
and
the
foliage
defaced
,
but
statues
of
the
queen
were
still
standing
in
the
recesses
;
and
altogether
the
effect
was
beautiful
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
must
have
been
charming
,
"
observed
Loftus
,
rubbing
his
hands
;
"
and
,
<EOS>
though
I
like
the
statue
,
I
would
much
rather
have
had
the
old
Gothic
cross
.
<EOS>
But
how
fortunate
the
former
escaped
destruction
in
Oliver
Cromwell
's
time
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
tell
you
how
that
came
to
pass
,
sir
,
"
replied
Morse
,
"
for
I
was
assistant
to
John
Rivers
,
the
brazier
,
to
whom
the
statue
was
sold
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
indeed
!
"
exclaimed
Loftus
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
heard
something
of
the
story
,
but
should
like
to
have
full
particulars
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
shall
hear
them
,
then
,
"
replied
Morse
.
"
<EOS>
Yon
statue
,
which
,
as
you
know
,
was
cast
by
Hubert
le
Sueur
,
in
1633
,
was
ordered
by
parliament
to
be
sold
and
broken
to
pieces
.
<EOS>
Well
,
my
master
,
John
Rivers
,
being
a
staunch
royalist
,
though
he
did
not
dare
to
avow
his
principles
,
determined
to
preserve
it
from
destruction
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
he
offered
a
good
round
sum
for
it
,
and
was
declared
the
purchaser
.
<EOS>
But
how
to
dispose
of
it
was
the
difficulty
.
<EOS>
He
could
trust
none
of
his
men
,
but
me
whom
he
knew
to
be
as
hearty
a
hater
of
the
Roundheads
,
and
as
loyal
to
the
memory
of
our
slaughtered
sovereign
,
as
himself
.
<EOS>
Well
,
we
digged
a
great
pit
,
secretly
,
in
the
cellar
,
whither
the
statue
had
been
conveyed
,
and
buried
it
.
<EOS>
The
job
occupied
us
nearly
a
month
;
and
during
that
time
,
my
master
collected
together
all
the
pieces
of
old
brass
he
could
procure
.
<EOS>
These
he
afterwards
produced
,
and
declared
they
were
the
fragments
of
the
statue
.
<EOS>
But
the
cream
of
the
jest
was
to
come
.
<EOS>
He
began
to
cast
handles
of
knives
and
forks
in
brass
,
giving
it
out
that
they
were
made
from
the
metal
of
the
statue
.
<EOS>
And
plenty
of
'em
he
sold
too
,
for
the
Cavaliers
bought
'em
as
memorials
of
their
martyred
monarch
,
and
the
Roundheads
as
evidences
of
his
fall
.
<EOS>
In
this
way
he
soon
got
back
his
outlay
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ha
!
ha
!
ha
!
"
laughed
Loftus
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
in
due
season
came
the
Restoration
,
"
pursued
Morse
;
"
and
my
master
made
known
to
King
Charles
<EOS>
the
Second
the
treasure
he
had
kept
concealed
for
him
.
<EOS>
It
was
digged
forth
,
placed
in
its
old
position--
<EOS>
but
I
forget
whether
the
brazier
was
rewarded
.
<EOS>
I
rather
think
not
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
matter
,
"
cried
Loftus
;
"
he
was
sufficiently
rewarded
by
the
consciousness
of
having
done
a
noble
action
.
<EOS>
But
let
us
go
and
examine
the
sculpture
on
the
pedestal
more
closely
.
"
 
<EOS>
With
this
,
he
crossed
over
the
road
;
and
,
taking
off
his
hat
,
thrust
his
head
through
the
iron
railing
surrounding
the
pedestal
,
while
Morse
,
in
order
to
point
out
the
beauties
of
the
sculpture
with
greater
convenience
,
mounted
upon
a
stump
beside
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
aware
that
this
is
the
work
of
Grinling
Gibbons
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
cried
the
dwarf
.
 
<EOS>
"
To
be
sure
I
am
,
"
replied
Loftus--"to
be
sure
.
<EOS>
What
fancy
and
gusto
is
displayed
in
the
treatment
of
these
trophies
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
execution
of
the
royal
arms
is
equally
admirable
,
"
cried
Morse
.
 
<EOS>
"
Never
saw
anything
finer
,
"
rejoined
Loftus--"never
,
upon
my
life
.
"
 
<EOS>
Every
one
knows
how
easily
a
crowd
is
collected
in
London
,
and
it
can
not
be
supposed
that
our
two
antiquaries
would
be
allowed
to
pursue
their
investigations
unmolested
.
<EOS>
Several
ragged
urchins
got
round
them
,
and
tried
to
discover
what
they
were
looking
at
,
at
the
same
time
cutting
their
jokes
upon
them
.
<EOS>
These
were
speedily
joined
by
a
street
-
sweeper
,
rather
young
in
the
profession
,
a
ticket
-
porter
,
a
butcher
's
apprentice
,
an
old
Israelitish
clothes
-
man
,
a
coalheaver
,
and
a
couple
of
charity
-
boys
.
 
<EOS>
"
My

cried
the
street
-
sweeper
,
"

<EOS>
If

"
 
<EOS>
"
Old
Spectacles

he
has
found

"
remarked
the
porter
;
"

"
 
<EOS>
"

;

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Only
think
of
living
all
my
life
in
London
,
and
never
examining
this
admirable
work
of
art
before
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Loftus
,
quite
unconscious
that
he
had
become
the
object
of
general
curiosity
.
 
<EOS>
"
Look
closer
at
it
,
old
gem'man
,
"
cried
the
porter
.
<EOS>
"
The
nearer
you
get
,
the
more
you
'll
admire
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Quite
true
,
"
replied
Loftus
,
fancying
Morse
had
spoken
;
"
it
'll
bear
the
closest
inspection
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
Ned
,
"
observed
one
of
the
charity
-
boys
to
the
other
,
"
do
you
get

;
they
must

"
 
<EOS>
"
I
'm
afraid

Joe

"
replied
the
other
;
"
but
just
give

a
lift
,
and
I
'll
try
.
"
<EOS>
"
Wot

<EOS>
cried
the
coal
-
heaver
;

"
 
<EOS>
"
Wot

<EOS>
cried
a
ragamuffin
lad
,
accompanied
by
a
bull
-
dog
.
<EOS>
"
I
've
a
good
mind
to
chuck
the

off

<EOS>
"
That

cried
another
rapscallion
behind
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Arrah

<EOS>
let

alone
,
will
you

,
you

<EOS>
"
cried
an
Irish
bricklayer
;
"
do

they

paiceable

"
 
<EOS>
"
Oh

<EOS>
screamed
the
little
street-
sweeper
.
<EOS>
"
Vell

<EOS>
"
Never

the

<EOS>
"
Och

cried
an
applewoman
,
against
whom
the
bricklayer
had
run
his
barrow
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Divil
seize
you
for

wagabone

<EOS>
Why
do

not
dhrive
into

in

way
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Axes
pardon
,
Molly
,
"
said
the
bricklayer
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
was
so
interested
in
them
antiquaries
,
that
I
did
n't
obsarve
ye
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Antiquaries
be

<EOS>
what
's
such
warmint
to

<EOS>
"
cried
the
applewoman
,
furious
.
<EOS>
"
You
've
destroyed
my
day
's
market
,
and
bad
luck
to
ye

"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
never
heed
,
Molly

"
cried
the
good
-
natured
bricklayer
;
"
I
'll
make

<EOS>
Pick

"
 
<EOS>
While
this
was
passing
,
a
stout
gentleman
came
from
the
farthest
side
of
the
statue
,
and
perceiving
Loftus
,
cried--"Why
,
brother
-
in
-
law
,
is
that
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
But
Loftus
was
too
much
engrossed
to
notice
him
,
and
continued
to
expiate
upon
the
beauty
of
the
trophies
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
are
you
talking
about
,
brother
?
"
<EOS>
cried
the
stout
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
"
Grinling
Gibbons
,
"
replied
Loftus
,
without
turning
round
.
"
<EOS>
Horace
Walpole
said
that
no
one
before
him
could
give
to
wood
the
airy
lightness
of
a
flower
,
and
here
he
has
given
it
to
a
stone
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
This
may
be
all
very
fine
,
my
good
fellow
,
"
said
the
stout
gentleman
,
seizing
him
by
the
shoulder
,
"
but
do
n't
you
see
the
crowd
you
're
collecting
round
you
?
<EOS>
You
'll
be
mobbed
presently
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
how
the
devil
did
you
come
here
,
brother
Thorneycroft
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Loftus
,
at
last
recognizing
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Come
along
,
and
I
'll
tell
you
,
"
replied
the
iron
-
merchant
,
dragging
him
away
,
while
Morse
followed
closely
behind
them
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
so
glad
to
have
met
you
,
"
pursued
Thorneycroft
,
as
soon
as
they
were
clear
of
the
mob
;
"
you
'll
be
shocked
to
hear
what
has
happened
to
your
niece
,
Ebba
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
what
has
happened
to
her
?
"
demanded
Loftus
.
<EOS>
"
You
alarm
me
.
<EOS>
Out
with
it
at
once
.
<EOS>
I
hate
to
be
kept
in
suspense
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
She
has
left
me
,
"
replied
Thorneycroft--"left
<EOS>
her
old
indulgent
father
--
run
away
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Run
away
!
"
exclaimed
Loftus
.
"
<EOS>
Impossible
!
<EOS>
I
'll
not
believe
it
--
even
from
your
lips
.
<EOS>
"
 
"
Would
it
were
not
so!--but
it
is
,
alas
!
<EOS>
too
true
,
"
replied
Thorneycroft
,
mournfully
.
"
<EOS>
And
the
thing
was
so
unnecessary
,
for
I
would
gladly
have
given
her
to
the
young
man
.
<EOS>
My
sole
hope
is
that
she
has
not
utterly
disgrace'd
herself
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
she
is
too
high
principled
for
that
,
"
cried
Loftus
.
"
<EOS>
Rest
easy
on
that
score
.
<EOS>
But
with
whom
has
she
run
away
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
With
a
young
man
named
Auriol
Darcy
,
"
replied
Thorneycroft
.
<EOS>
"
He
was
brought
to
my
house
under
peculiar
circumstances
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
never
heard
of
him
,
"
said
Loftus
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
I
have
,
"
interposed
Morse
.
<EOS>
"
I
've
known
him
these
two
hundred
years
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Eh
day
!
<EOS>
who
's
this
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Thorneycroft
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
crack
-
brained
little
fellow
,
whom
I
've
engaged
as
valet
,
"
replied
Loftus
.
"
<EOS>
He
fancies
he
was
born
in
Queen
Elizabeth
's
time
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
no
fancy
,
"
cried
Morse
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
perfectly
acquainted
with
Auriol
Darcy
's
history
.
<EOS>
He
drank
of
the
same
elixir
as
myself
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
If
you
know
him
,
can
you
give
us
a
clue
to
find
him
?
"
asked
Thorneycroft
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
I
can
not
,
"
replied
Morse
.
<EOS>
"
I
only
saw
him
for
a
few
minutes
the
other
night
,
after
I
had
been
thrown
into
the
Serpentine
by
the
tall
man
in
the
black
cloak
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
's
that
you
say
?
<EOS>
"
cried
Thorneycroft
,
quickly
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
heard
Ebba
speak
of
a
tall
man
in
a
black
cloak
having
some
mysterious
connection
with
Auriol
.
<EOS>
I
hope
that
person
has
nothing
to
do
with
her
disappearance
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
n't
wonder
if
he
had
,
"
replied
Morse
.
<EOS>
"
I
believe
that
black
gentleman
to
be---
"
 
<EOS>
"
What!--who
?
"
demanded
Thorneycroft
.
 
<EOS>
"
Neither
more
nor
less
than
the
devil
,
"
replied
Morse
,
mysteriously
.
 
<EOS>
"
Pshaw
!
<EOS>
poh
!
<EOS>
"
cried
Loftus
.
<EOS>
"
I
told
you
the
poor
fellow
was
half
cracked
.
"
 
<EOS>
At
this
moment
,
a
roguish
-
looking
fellow
,
with
red
whiskers
and
hair
,
and
clad
in
a
velveteen
jacket
with
ivory
buttons
,
who
had
been
watching
the
iron
-
merchant
at
some
distance
,
came
up
,
and
touching
his
hat
,
said
,
"
Mr.
Thorneycroft
,
I
believe
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
My
name
is
Thorneycroft
,
fellow
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
iron
-
merchant
,
eyeing
him
askance
.
"
<EOS>
And
your
name
,
I
fancy
,
is
Ginger
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Exactly
,
sir
,
"
replied
the
dog
-
fancier
,
again
touching
his
hat
,
"
ex-
actly
.
<EOS>
I
did
n't
think
you
would
rekilect
me
,
sir
.
<EOS>
I
bring
you
some
news
of
your
darter
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Of
Ebba
!
"
exclaimed
Thorneycroft
,
in
a
tone
of
deep
emotion
.
<EOS>
"
I
hope
your
news
is
good
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
wish
it
wos
better
,
for
her
sake
as
well
as
yours
,
sir
,
"
replied
the
dog
-
fancier
,
gravely
;
"
but
I
'm
afeerd
<EOS>
she
's
in
werry
bad
hands
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
she
is
,
if
she
's
in
the
hands
<EOS>
o
'
the
black
gentleman
,
"
observed
Morse
.
 
<EOS>
"
Vy
,
Old
Parr
,
that
ai
n't
you
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Ginger
,
gazing
at
him
in
astonishment
.
<EOS>
"
Vy
,
'
ow
you
are
transmogrified
,
to
be
sure
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
what
of
my
daughter
?
"
cried
Thorneycroft
;
"
where
is
she
?
<EOS>
Take
me
to
her
,
and
you
shall
be
well
rewarded
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
'll
do
my
best
to
take
you
to
her
,
and
without
any
reward
,
sir
,
"
replied
Ginger
,
"
for
my
heart
bleeds
for
the
poor
young
creater
.
<EOS>
As
I
said
afore
,
she
's
in
dreadful
bad
hands
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Do
you
allude
to
Mr.
Auriol
Darcy
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Thorneycroft
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
he
's
as
much
a
wictim
of
this
infernal
plot
as
your
darter
,
"
replied
Ginger
;
"
I
thought
him
quite
different
at
first
--
but
I
've
altered
my
mind
entirely
since
some
matters
has
come
to
my
knowledge
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
alarm
me
greatly
by
these
dark
hints
,
"
cried
Thorneycroft
.
<EOS>
"
What
is
to
be
done
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
know
in
a
few
hours
,
"
replied
Ginger
.
<EOS>
"
I
ai
n't
got
the
exact
clue
yet
.
<EOS>
But
come
to
me
at
eleven
o'clock
tonight
,
at
the
Turk
's
Head
,
at
<EOS>
the
back
o
'
Shoreditch
Church
,
and
<EOS>
I
'll
put
you
on
the
right
scent
.
<EOS>
You
must
come
alone
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
wish
this
gentleman
,
my
brother
-
in
-
law
,
to
accompany
me
,
"
said
Thorneycroft
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
could
n't
help
you
,
"
replied
Ginger
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
take
care
to
have
plenty
of
assistance
.
<EOS>
It
's
a
dangerous
bus'ness
,
and
can
only
be
managed
in
a
sartin
way
,
and
by
a
sartin
person
,
and
he
'd
object
to
any
von
<EOS>
but
you
.
<EOS>
Tonight
,
at
eleven
!
<EOS>
Good
by
,
Old
Parr
.
<EOS>
We
shall
meet
again
ere
long

<EOS>
And
without
a

more
,
he
hurried
away

PREPARATIONS
 
<EOS>
On
that
same
night
,
at
the
appointed
hour
,
Mr.
Thorneycroft
repaired
to
Shoreditch
,
and
entering
a
narrow
street
behind
the
church
,
speedily
discovered
the
Turk
's
Head
,
at
the
door
of
which
a
hackney-
coach
was
standing
.
<EOS>
He
was
shown
by
the
landlord
into
a
small
back
room
,
in
which
three
men
were
seated
at
a
small
table
,
smoking
,
and
drinking
gin
and
water
,
while
a
fourth
was
standing
near
the
fire
,
with
his
back
towards
the
door
.
<EOS>
The
latter
was
a
tall
powerfully
-
built
man
,
wrapped
in
a
rough
great
-
coat
,
and
did
not
turn
round
on
the
iron
-
merchant
's
entrance
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
punctual
,
Mr.
Thorneycroft
,
"
said
Ginger
,
who
was
one
of
the
trio
at
the
table
;
"
and
I
'm
happy
to
say
<EOS>
,
I
've
arranged
everythin
'
for
you
,
sir
.
<EOS>
My
friends
are
ready
to
undertake
the
job
.
<EOS>
Only
they
von't
do
it
on
quite
sich
easy
terms
as
mine
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
Tinker
and
the
Sandman
coughed
slightly
,
to
intimate
their
entire
concurrence
in
Mr.
Ginger
's
remark
.
 
<EOS>
"
As
I
said
to
you
this
mornin
'
,
Mr.
Thorneycroft
,
"
pursued
Ginger
,
"
this
is
a
difficult
and
a
dangerous
bus'ness
;
and
there
's
<EOS>
no
knowin
'
wot
may
come
on
it
.
<EOS>
But
it
's
your
only
chance
<EOS>
o
'
recoverin
'
your
darter
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
it
's
your
only
chance
,
"
echoed
the
Tinker
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ve're
about
to
risk
our
precious
lives
for
you
,
sir
<EOS>
,
"
said
the
Sandman
;
"
so
,
in
coorse
,
ve
expects
a
perportionate
revard
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
If
you
enable
me
to
regain
my
daughter
,
you
shall
not
find
me
ungrateful
,
"
rejoined
the
iron
-
merchant
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
must
have
a
hundred
pounds
,
"
said
the
Tinker--"that
's
my
lowest
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
mine
,
too
,
"
said
the
Sandman
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
take
nuffin
'
but
the
glory
,
as
I
said
afore
,
"
remarked
Ginger
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
sworn
champion
o
'
poor
distressed
young
damsils
;
but
my
friends
must
make
their
own
bargins
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
assent
,
"
returned
Mr.
Thorneycroft
;
"
and
the
sooner
we
set
out
the
better
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Are
you
armed
?
"
asked
Ginger
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
a
brace
of
pistols
in
my
pocket
,
"
replied
Thorneycroft
.
 
<EOS>
"
All
right
,
then
--
ve've
all
got
pops
and
cutlashes
,
"
said
Ginger
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
So
let
's
be
off
.
"
 
<EOS>
As
he
spoke
,
the
Tinker
and
Sandman
arose
;
and
the
man
in
the
rough
great
-
coat
,
who
had
hitherto
remained
with
his
back
to
them
,
turned
round
.
<EOS>
To
the
iron
-
merchant
's
surprise
,
he
perceived
that
the
face
of
this
individual
was
covered
with
a
piece
of
black
crepe
.
 
<EOS>
"
Who
is
this
!
"
<EOS>
he
demanded
with
some
misgiving
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
friend
,
"
replied
Ginger
.
<EOS>
"
Vithout
him
ve
could
do
nuffin
'
.
<EOS>
His
name
is
Reeks
,
and
he
is
the
chiefman
in
our
enterprise
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
claims
a
reward
too
,
I
suppose
?
"
said
Thorneycroft
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
tell
you
what
reward
I
claim
,
Mr.
Thorneycroft
,
"
rejoined
Reeks
,
in
a
deep
stern
tone
,
"
when
all
is
over
.
<EOS>
Meantime
,
give
me
your
solemn
pledge
,
that
whatever
you
may
behold
tonight
,
you
will
not
divulge
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
give
it
,
"
replied
the
iron
-
merchant
,
"
provided
always---
"
 
"
No
provision
,
sir
,
"
interrupted
the
other
,
quickly
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
swear
to
keep
silence
unconditionally
,
or
I
will
not
move
a
foot
-
step
with
you
;
and
I
alone
can
guide
you
where
your
daughter
is
detained
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Svear
,
sir
;
it
is
your
only
chance
,
"
whispered
Ginger
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
if
it
must
be
,
I
do
swear
to
keep
silence
,
"
rejoined
Mr.
Thorneycroft
;
"
but
your
proceedings
appear
very
mysterious
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
whole
affair
is
mysterious
,
"
replied
Reeks
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
also
consent
to
have
a
bandage
passed
over
your
eyes
when
you
get
into
the
coach
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Anything
more
?
"
asked
the
iron
-
merchant
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
must
engage
to
obey
my
orders
,
without
questioning
,
when
we
arrive
at
our
destination
,
"
rejoined
Reeks
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Otherwise
,
there
is
no
chance
of
success
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Be
it
as
you
will
,
"
returned
Thorneycroft
,
"
I
must
perforce
agree
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
All
then
is
clearly
understood
,
"
said
Reeks
,
"
and
we
can
now
set
out
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Upon
this
,
Ginger
conducted
Mr.
Thorneycroft
to
the
coach
,
and
as
soon
as
the
latter
got
into
it
,
tied
a
handkerchief
tightly
over
his
eyes
.
<EOS>
In
this
state
Mr.
Thorneycroft
heard
the
Tinker
and
the
Sandman
take
their
places
near
him
,
but
not
remarking
the
voice
of
Reeks
,
concluded
that
he
must
have
got
outside
.
 
<EOS>
The
next
moment
,
the
coach
was
put
in
motion
,
and
rattled
over
the
stones
at
a
rapid
pace
.
<EOS>
It
made
many
turns
;
but
at
length
proceeded
steadily
onwards
,
while
from
the
profound
silence
around
,
and
the
greater
freshness
of
the
air
,
Mr.
Thorneycroft
began
to
fancy
they
had
gained
the
country
.
<EOS>
Not
a
word
was
spoken
by
anyone
during
the
ride
.
 
<EOS>
After
a
while
,
the
coach
stopped
,
the
door
was
opened
,
and
Mr.
Thorneycroft
was
helped
out
.
<EOS>
The
iron
-
merchant
expected
his
bandage
would
now
be
removed
,
but
he
was
mistaken
,
for
Reeks
,
taking
his
arm
,
drew
him
along
at
a
quick
pace
.
<EOS>
As
they
advanced
,
the
iron
-
merchant
's
conductor
whispered
him
to
be
cautious
,
and
,
at
the
same
time
,
made
him
keep
close
to
a
wall
.
<EOS>
A
door
was
presently
opened
,
and
as
soon
as
the
party
had
passed
through
it
,
closed
.
 
<EOS>
The
bandage
was
then
removed
from
Thorneycroft
's
eyes
,
and
he
found
himself
in
a
large
and
apparently
neglected
garden
.
<EOS>
Though
the
sky
was
cloudy
,
there
was
light
enough
to
enable
him
to
distinguish
that
they
were
near
an
old
dilapidated
mansion
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
are
now
arrived
,
"
said
Reeks
,
to
the
iron
-
merchant
,
"
and
you
will
have
need
of
all
your
resolution
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
deliver
her
,
or
perish
in
the
attempt
,
"
said
Thorneycroft
,
taking
out
his
pistols
.
<EOS>
The
others
drew
their
cutlasses
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
then
,
follow
me
,
"
said
Reeks
,
"
and
act
as
I
direct
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
With
this
he
struck
into
an
alley
formed
by
thick
hedges
of
privet
,
which
brought
them
to
the
back
part
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
Passing
through
a
door
,
he
entered
the
yard
,
and
creeping
cautiously
along
the
wall
,
reached
a
low
window
,
which
he
contrived
to
open
without
noise
.
<EOS>
He
then
passed
through
it
,
and
was
followed
by
the
others
.

<EOS>
THE
CHAMBER
OF
MYSTERY
 
<EOS>
We
shall
now
return
to
the
night
of
Ebba
's
seizure
by
the
mysterious
stranger
.
<EOS>
Though
almost
deprived
of
consciousness
by
terror
,
the
poor
girl
could
distinguish
,
from
the
movements
of
her
captor
,
that
she
was
borne
down
a
flight
of
steps
,
or
some
steep
descent
,
and
then
for
a
considerable
distance
along
level
ground
.
<EOS>
She
was
next
placed
in
a
carriage
,
which
was
driven
with
great
swiftness
,
and
though
it
was
impossible
to
conjecture
in
what
direction
<EOS>
she
was
conveyed
,
it
seemed
to
her
terrified
imagination
as
if
she
were
hurried
down
a
precipice
,
and
she
expected
every
moment
to
be
dashed
in
pieces
.
<EOS>
At
length
,
the
vehicle
stopped
,
and
she
was
lifted
out
of
it
,
and
carried
along
a
winding
passage
;
after
which
,
the
creaking
of
hinges
announced
that
a
door
was
opened
.
<EOS>
Having
passed
through
it
,
she
was
deposited
on
a
bench
,
when
,
fright
over
-
mastering
her
,
her
senses
completely
forsook
her
.
 
<EOS>
On
recovering
,
she
found
herself
seated
on
a
fauteuil
covered
with
black
velvet
,
in
the
midst
of
a
gloomy
chamber
of
vast
extent
,
while
beside
her
,
and
supporting
her
from
falling
,
stood
the
mysterious
and
terrible
stranger
.
<EOS>
He
held
a
large
goblet
filled
with
some
potent
liquid
to
her
lips
,
and
compelled
her
to
swallow
a
portion
of
it
.
<EOS>
The
powerful
stimulant
revived
her
,
but
,
at
the
same
time
,
produced
a
strange
excitement
,
against
which
she
struggled
with
all
her
power
.
<EOS>
Her
persecutor
again
held
the
goblet
towards
her
,
while
a
sardonic
smile
played
upon
his
features
.
 
<EOS>
"
Drink
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
;
"
it
will
restore
you
,
and
you
have
much
to
go
through
.
"
 
<EOS>
Ebba
mechanically
took
the
cup
,
and
raised
it
to
her
lips
,
but
noticing
the
stranger
's
glance
of
exaltation
,
dashed
it
to
the
ground
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
acted
foolishly
,
"
he
said
,
sternly
;
"
the
potion
would
have
done
you
good
.
"
 
<EOS>
Withdrawing
her
eyes
from
his
gaze
,
which
she
felt
exercise
and
irresistible
influence
over
her
,
Ebba
gazed
fearfully
round
the
chamber
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
vast
and
gloomy
,
and
seemed
like
the
interior
of
a
sepulchre--
<EOS>
the
walls
and
ceiling
being
formed
of
black
marble
,
while
the
floor
was
paved
with
the
same
material
.
<EOS>
Not
far
from
where
she
sat
,
on
an
estrade
,
approached
by
a
couple
of
steps
,
stood
a
table
covered
with
black
velvet
,
on
which
was
placed
an
immense
lamp
,
fashioned
like
an
imp
supporting
a
cauldron
on
his
outstretched
wings
.
<EOS>
In
this
lamp
were
several
burners
,
which
cast
a
lurid
light
throughout
the
chamber
.
<EOS>
Over
it
hung
a
cap
equally
fantastically
fashioned
.
<EOS>
A
dagger
,
with
a
richly
wrought
hilt
,
was
stuck
into
the
table
;
and
beside
it
lay
a
strangely
shaped
mask
,
an
open
book
,
an
antique
inkstand
,
and
a
piece
of
parchment
,
on
which
some
characters
were
inscribed
.
<EOS>
Opposite
these
stood
a
curiously
carved
ebony
chair
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
lower
end
of
the
room
,
which
was
slightly
elevated
above
the
rest
,
hung
a
large
black
curtain
;
and
on
the
step
,
in
front
of
it
,
were
placed
two
vases
of
jet
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
is
behind
that
curtain
?
"
<EOS>
shudderingly
demanded
Ebba
of
her
companion
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
will
see
anon
,
"
he
replied
.
"
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
seat
yourself
on
that
chair
,
and
glance
at
the
writing
on
the
scroll
.
"
 
<EOS>
Ebba
did
not
move
,
but
the
stranger
took
her
hand
,
and
drew
her
to
the
seat
.
 
<EOS>
"
Read
what
is
written
on
that
paper
,
"
he
cried
,
imperiously
.
 
<EOS>
Ebba
glanced
at
the
document
,
and
a
shudder
passed
over
her
frame
.
 
<EOS>
"
By
this
,
"
she
cried
,
"
I
surrender
myself
,
soul
and
body
,
to
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
do
,
"
replied
the
stranger
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
committed
no
crime
that
can
place
me
within
the
power
of
the
Fiend
,
"
cried
Ebba
,
falling
upon
her
knees
.
<EOS>
"
I
call
upon
Heaven
for
protection
!
<EOS>
Avaunt
!
"
 
<EOS>
As
the
words
were
uttered
,
the
cap
suddenly
fell
upon
the
lamp
,
and
the
chamber
was
buried
in
profound
darkness
.
<EOS>
Mocking
laughter
rang
in
her
ears
,
succeeded
by
wailing
cries
inexpressibly
dreadful
to
hear
.
 
<EOS>
Ebba
continued
to
pray
fervently
for
her
own
deliverance
,
and
for
that
of
Auriol
.
<EOS>
In
the
midst
of
her
supplications
she
was
aroused
by
strains
of
music
in
the
most
exquisite
sweetness
,
proceeding
apparently
from
behind
the
curtain
,
and
while
listening
to
these
sounds
she
was
startled
by
a
deafening
crash
as
if
a
large
gong
had
been
stricken
.
<EOS>
The
cover
of
the
lamp
was
then
slowly
raised
,
and
the
burners
blazed
forth
as
before
,
while
from
the
two
vases
in
front
of
the
curtain
arose
clouds
of
incense
,
filling
the
chamber
with
stupifying
fragrance
.
 
<EOS>
Again
the
gong
was
stricken
,
and
Ebba
looked
round
towards
the
curtain
.
<EOS>
Above
each
vase
towered
a
gigantic
figure
,
wrapped
in
a
long
black
cloak
,
the
lower
part
of
which
was
concealed
by
the
thick
vapour
.
<EOS>
Hoods
,
like
the
cowls
of
monks
,
were
drawn
over
the
heads
of
these
grim
and
motionless
figures
;
mufflers
enveloped
their
chins
,
and
they
wore
masks
,
from
the
holes
of
which
gleamed
eyes
of
unearthly
brightness
.
<EOS>
Their
hands
were
crossed
upon
their
breasts
.
<EOS>
Between
them
squatted
two
other
spectral
forms
,
similarly
cloaked
,
hooded
,
and
masked
,
with
their
gleaming
eyes
fixed
upon
her
,
and
their
skinny
fingers
pointing
derisively
at
her
.
 
<EOS>
Behind
the
curtain
was
placed
a
strong
light
,
which
showed
a
wide
staircase
of
black
marble
,
leading
to
some
upper
chamber
,
and
at
the
same
time
threw
the
reflection
of
a
gigantic
figure
upon
the
drapery
,
while
a
hand
,
the
finger
of
which
pointed
towards
her
,
was
thrust
from
an
opening
between
its
folds
.
 
<EOS>
Forcibly
averting
her
gaze
,
Ebba
covered
her
eyes
with
her
hands
,
but
looking
up
again
after
a
brief
space
,
beheld
an
ebon
door
at
the
side
revolve
upon
its
hinges
,
and
give
entrance
to
three
female
figures
,
robed
in
black
,
hooded
and
veiled
,
and
having
their
hands
folded
,
in
a
melancholy
manner
,
across
their
breasts
.
<EOS>
Slowly
and
noiselessly
advancing
,
they
halted
within
a
few
paces
of
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
Who
,
and
what
are
ye
?
<EOS>
"
she
cried
,
wild
with
terror
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
victims
of
Auriol
!
"
replied
the
figure
on
the
right
.
"
<EOS>
As
we
are
,
such
will
you
be
ere
long
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
crime
have
you
committed
?
"
demanded
Ebba
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
have
loved
him
,
"
replied
the
second
figure
.
 
<EOS>
"
Is
that
a
crime
?
"
cried
Ebba
.
<EOS>
"
If
so
,
I
am
equally
culpable
with
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
will
share
our
doom
,
"
replied
the
third
figure
.
 
<EOS>
"
Heaven
have
mercy
upon
me
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
agonized
girl
,
dropping
upon
her
knees
.
 
<EOS>
At
this
moment
a
terrible
voice
from
behind
the
curtain
exclaimed---
 
"
Sign
,
or
Auriol
is
lost
for
ever
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
yield
my
soul
,
even
to
save
him
,
"
cried
Ebba
distractedly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Witness
his
chastisement
,
then
,
"
cried
the
voice
.
 
<EOS>
And
as
the
words
were
uttered
,
a
side
door
was
opened
on
the
opposite
side
,
and
Auriol
was
dragged
forth
from
it
by
two
masked
personages
,
who
looked
like
familiars
of
the
Inquisition
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
not
yield
to
the
demands
of
this
fiend
,
Ebba
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Auriol
,
gazing
at
her
distractedly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Will
you
save
him
before
he
is
cast
,
living
,
into
the
tomb
?
"
cried
the
voice
.
 
<EOS>
And
at
the
words
,
a
heavy
slab
or
marble
rose
slowly
from
the
floor
near
where
Ebba
sat
,
and
disclosed
a
dark
pit
beneath
.
 
<EOS>
Ebba
gazed
into
the
abyss
with
indescribable
terror
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
he
will
be
immured
,
unless
you
sign
,
"
cried
the
voice
;
"
and
,
as
he
is
immortal
,
he
will
endure
an
eternity
of
torture
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
save
him
so
,
but
I
may
precede
him
,
"
cried
Ebba
.
<EOS>
And
throwing
her
hands
aloft
,
she
flung
herself
into
the
pit
.
 
<EOS>
A
fearful
cry
resounded
through
the
chamber
.
<EOS>
It
broke
from
Auriol
,
who
vainly
strove
to
burst
from
those
who
held
him
,
and
precipitate
himself
after
Ebba
.
 
<EOS>
Soon
after
this
,
and
while
Auriol
was
gazing
into
the
abyss
,
a
tongue
of
blue
flame
arose
from
it
,
danced
for
a
moment
in
the
air
,
and
then
vanished
.
<EOS>
No
sooner
was
it
gone
than
a
figure
,
shrouded
in
black
habiliments
,
and
hooded
and
muffled
up
like
the
three
other
female
forms
,
slowly
ascended
from
the
vault
,
apparently
without
support
,
and
remained
motionless
at
its
brink
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ebba
!
"
exclaimed
Auriol
,
in
a
voice
of
despair
.
<EOS>
"
Is
it
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
The
figure
bowed
its
head
,
but
spoke
not
.
 
<EOS>
"
Sign
!
"
thundered
the
voice
.
"
<EOS>
Your
attempt
at
self
-
destruction
has
placed
you
wholly
in
my
power
.
<EOS>
Sign
!
"
 
<EOS>
At
this
injunction
,
the
figure
moved
slowly
towards
the
table
,
and
,
to
his
unspeakable
horror
,
Auriol
beheld
it
take
up
the
pen
and
write
upon
the
parchment
.
<EOS>
He
bent
forward
,
and
saw
that
the
name
inscribed
thereon
was
EBBA
THORNEYCROFT
.
 
<EOS>
The
groan
to
which
he
gave
utterance
was
echoed
by
a
roar
of
diabolical
laughter
.
 
<EOS>
The
figure
then
moved
slowly
away
,
and
ranged
itself
with
the
other
veiled
forms
.
 
<EOS>
"
All
is
accomplished
,
"
cried
the
voice
.
"
<EOS>
Away
with
him
!
"
 
<EOS>
On
this
,
a
terrible
clangour
was
heard
;
the
lights
were
extinguished
;
and
Auriol
was
dragged
through
the
doorway
from
which
he
had
been
brought
forth
.
