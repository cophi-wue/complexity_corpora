  
<EOS>
Mr.
Vavasor
and
His
Daughter
.
 
<EOS>
Whether
or
no
,
she
,
whom
you
are
to
forgive
,
if
you
can
,
did
or
did
not
belong
to
the
Upper
Ten
Thousand
of
this
our
English
world
,
I
am
not
prepared
to
say
with
any
strength
of
affirmation
.
<EOS>
By
blood
she
was
connected
with
big
people
,
 
distantly
connected
with
some
very
big
people
indeed
,
people
who
belonged
to
the
Upper
Ten
Hundred
if
there
be
any
such
division
;
but
of
these
very
big
relations
she
had
known
and
seen
little
,
and
they
had
cared
as
little
for
her
.
<EOS>
Her
grandfather
,
Squire
Vavasor
of
Vavasor
Hall
,
in
Westmoreland
,
was
a
country
gentleman
,
possessing
some
thousand
a
year
at
the
outside
,
and
he
therefore
never
came
up
to
London
,
and
had
no
ambition
to
have
himself
numbered
as
one
in
any
exclusive
set
.
<EOS>
A
hot
-
headed
,
ignorant
,
honest
old
gentleman
,
he
lived
ever
at
Vavasor
Hall
,
declaring
to
any
who
would
listen
to
him
,
that
the
country
was
going
to
the
mischief
,
and
congratulating
himself
that
at
any
rate
,
in
his
county
,
parliamentary
reform
had
been
powerless
to
alter
the
old
political
arrangements
.
<EOS>
Alice
Vavasor
,
whose
offence
against
the
world
I
am
to
tell
you
,
and
if
possible
to
excuse
,
was
the
daughter
of
his
younger
son
;
and
as
her
father
,
John
Vavasor
,
had
done
nothing
to
raise
the
family
name
to
eminence
,
Alice
could
not
lay
claim
to
any
high
position
from
her
birth
as
a
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
John
Vavasor
had
come
up
to
London
early
in
life
as
a
barrister
,
and
had
failed
.
<EOS>
He
had
failed
at
least
in
attaining
either
much
wealth
or
much
repute
,
though
he
had
succeeded
in
earning
,
or
perhaps
I
might
better
say
,
in
obtaining
,
a
livelihood
.
<EOS>
He
had
married
a
lady
somewhat
older
than
himself
,
who
was
in
possession
of
four
hundred
a
year
,
and
who
was
related
to
those
big
people
to
whom
I
have
alluded
.
<EOS>
Who
these
were
and
the
special
nature
of
the
relationship
,
I
shall
be
called
upon
to
explain
hereafter
,
but
at
present
it
will
suffice
to
say
that
Alice
Macleod
gave
great
offence
to
all
her
friends
by
her
marriage
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
,
however
,
give
them
much
time
for
the
indulgence
of
their
anger
.
<EOS>
Having
given
birth
to
a
daughter
within
twelve
months
of
her
marriage
,
she
died
,
leaving
in
abeyance
that
question
as
to
whether
the
fault
of
her
marriage
should
or
should
not
be
pardoned
by
her
family
.
  
<EOS>
When
a
man
marries
an
heiress
for
her
money
,
if
that
money
be
within
her
own
control
,
as
was
the
case
with
Miss
Macleod
's
fortune
,
it
is
generally
well
for
the
speculating
lover
that
the
lady
's
friends
should
quarrel
with
him
and
with
her
.
<EOS>
She
is
thereby
driven
to
throw
herself
entirely
into
the
gentleman
's
arms
,
and
he
thus
becomes
possessed
of
the
wife
and
the
money
without
the
abominable
nuisance
of
stringent
settlements
.
<EOS>
But
the
Macleods
,
though
they
quarrelled
with
Alice
,
did
not
quarrel
with
her
_
<EOS>
à
l'outrance
_
.
<EOS>
They
snubbed
herself
and
her
chosen
husband
;
but
they
did
not
so
far
separate
themselves
from
her
and
her
affairs
as
to
give
up
the
charge
of
her
possessions
.
<EOS>
Her
four
hundred
a
year
was
settled
very
closely
on
herself
and
on
her
children
,
without
even
a
life
interest
having
been
given
to
Mr.
Vavasor
,
and
therefore
when
she
died
the
mother
's
fortune
became
the
property
of
the
little
baby
.
<EOS>
But
,
under
these
circumstances
,
the
big
people
did
not
refuse
to
interest
themselves
to
some
extent
on
behalf
of
the
father
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
suppose
that
any
actual
agreement
or
compact
was
made
between
Mr.
Vavasor
and
the
Macleods
;
but
it
came
to
be
understood
between
them
that
if
he
made
no
demand
upon
them
for
his
daughter
's
money
,
and
allowed
them
to
have
charge
of
her
education
,
they
would
do
something
for
him
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
practising
barrister
,
though
his
practice
had
never
amounted
to
much
;
and
a
practising
barrister
is
always
supposed
to
be
capable
of
filling
any
situation
which
may
come
his
way
.
<EOS>
Two
years
after
his
wife
's
death
Mr.
Vavasor
was
appointed
assistant
commissioner
in
some
office
which
had
to
do
with
insolvents
,
and
which
was
abolished
three
years
after
his
appointment
.
<EOS>
It
was
at
first
thought
that
he
would
keep
his
eight
hundred
a
year
for
life
and
be
required
to
do
nothing
for
it
;
but
a
wretched
cheeseparing
Whig
government
,
as
John
Vavasor
called
it
when
describing
the
circumstances
of
the
arrangement
to
his
father
,
down
in
Westmoreland
,
would
not
permit
this
;
it
gave
him
the
option
of
taking
four
hundred
a
year
for
doing
nothing
,
or
of
keeping
his
whole
income
and
attending
three
days
a
week
for
three
hours
a
day
during
term
time
,
at
a
miserable
dingy
little
office
near
Chancery
Lane
,
where
his
duty
would
consist
in
signing
his
name
to
accounts
which
he
never
read
,
and
at
which
he
was
never
supposed
even
to
look
.
<EOS>
He
had
sulkily
elected
to
keep
the
money
,
and
this
signing
had
been
now
for
nearly
twenty
years
the
business
of
his
life
.
<EOS>
Of
course
he
considered
himself
to
be
a
very
hardly
-
used
man
.
<EOS>
One
Lord
Chancellor
after
another
he
petitioned
,
begging
that
he
might
be
relieved
from
the
cruelty
of
his
position
,
and
allowed
to
take
his
salary
without
doing
anything
in
return
for
it
.
<EOS>
The
amount
of
work
which
he
did
perform
was
certainly
a
minimum
of
labour
.
<EOS>
Term
time
,
as
terms
were
counted
in
Mr.
Vavasor
's
office
,
hardly
comprised
half
the
year
,
and
the
hours
of
weekly
attendance
did
not
do
more
than
make
one
day
's
work
a
week
for
a
working
man
;
but
Mr.
Vavasor
had
been
appointed
an
assistant
commissioner
,
and
with
every
Lord
Chancellor
he
argued
that
all
Westminster
Hall
,
and
Lincoln
's
Inn
to
boot
,
had
no
right
to
call
upon
him
to
degrade
himself
by
signing
his
name
to
accounts
.
<EOS>
In
answer
to
every
memorial
he
was
offered
the
alternative
of
freedom
with
half
his
income
;
and
so
the
thing
went
on
.
  
<EOS>
There
can
,
however
,
be
no
doubt
that
Mr.
Vavasor
was
better
off
and
happier
with
his
almost
nominal
employment
than
he
would
have
been
without
it
.
<EOS>
He
always
argued
that
it
kept
him
in
London
;
but
he
would
undoubtedly
have
lived
in
London
with
or
without
his
official
occupation
.
<EOS>
He
had
become
so
habituated
to
London
life
in
a
small
way
,
before
the
choice
of
leaving
London
was
open
to
him
,
that
nothing
would
have
kept
him
long
away
from
it
.
<EOS>
After
his
wife
's
death
he
dined
at
his
club
every
day
on
which
a
dinner
was
not
given
to
him
by
some
friend
elsewhere
,
and
was
rarely
happy
except
when
so
dining
.
<EOS>
They
who
have
seen
him
scanning
the
steward
's
list
of
dishes
,
and
giving
the
necessary
orders
for
his
own
and
his
friend
's
dinner
,
at
about
half
past
four
in
the
afternoon
,
have
seen
John
Vavasor
at
the
only
moment
of
the
day
at
which
he
is
ever
much
in
earnest
.
<EOS>
All
other
things
are
light
and
easy
to
him
,
 
to
be
taken
easily
and
to
be
dismissed
easily
.
<EOS>
Even
the
eating
of
the
dinner
calls
forth
from
him
no
special
sign
of
energy
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
a
frown
will
gather
on
his
brow
as
he
tastes
the
first
half
glass
from
his
bottle
of
claret
;
but
as
a
rule
that
which
he
has
prepared
for
himself
with
so
much
elaborate
care
,
is
consumed
with
only
pleasant
enjoyment
.
<EOS>
Now
and
again
it
will
happen
that
the
cook
is
treacherous
even
to
him
,
and
then
he
can
hit
hard
;
but
in
hitting
he
is
quiet
,
and
strikes
with
a
smile
on
his
face
.
  
<EOS>
Such
had
been
Mr.
Vavasor
's
pursuits
and
pleasures
in
life
up
to
the
time
at
which
my
story
commences
.
<EOS>
But
I
must
not
allow
the
reader
to
suppose
that
he
was
a
man
without
good
qualities
.
<EOS>
Had
he
when
young
possessed
the
gift
of
industry
I
think
that
he
might
have
shone
in
his
profession
,
and
have
been
well
spoken
of
and
esteemed
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
As
it
was
he
was
a
discontented
man
,
but
nevertheless
he
was
popular
,
and
to
some
extent
esteemed
.
<EOS>
He
was
liberal
as
far
as
his
means
would
permit
;
he
was
a
man
of
his
word
;
and
he
understood
well
that
code
of
by
-
laws
which
was
presumed
to
constitute
the
character
of
a
gentleman
in
his
circle
.
<EOS>
He
knew
how
to
carry
himself
well
among
men
,
and
understood
thoroughly
what
might
be
said
,
and
what
might
not
;
what
might
be
done
among
those
with
whom
he
lived
,
and
what
should
be
left
undone
.
<EOS>
By
nature
,
too
,
he
was
kindly
disposed
,
loving
many
persons
a
little
if
he
loved
few
or
none
passionately
.
<EOS>
Moreover
,
at
the
age
of
fifty
,
he
was
a
handsome
man
,
with
a
fine
forehead
,
round
which
the
hair
and
beard
was
only
beginning
to
show
itself
to
be
grey
.
<EOS>
He
stood
well
,
with
a
large
person
,
only
now
beginning
to
become
corpulent
.
<EOS>
His
eyes
were
bright
and
grey
,
and
his
mouth
and
chin
were
sharply
cut
,
and
told
of
gentle
birth
.
<EOS>
Most
men
who
knew
John
Vavasor
well
,
declared
it
to
be
a
pity
that
he
should
spend
his
time
in
signing
accounts
in
Chancery
Lane
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
said
that
Alice
Vavasor
's
big
relatives
cared
but
little
for
her
in
her
early
years
;
but
I
have
also
said
that
they
were
careful
to
undertake
the
charge
of
her
education
,
and
I
must
explain
away
this
little
discrepancy
.
<EOS>
The
biggest
of
these
big
people
had
hardly
heard
of
her
;
but
there
was
a
certain
Lady
Macleod
,
not
very
big
herself
,
but
,
as
it
were
,
hanging
on
to
the
skirts
of
those
who
were
so
,
who
cared
very
much
for
Alice
.
<EOS>
She
was
the
widow
of
a
Sir
Archibald
Macleod
,
K.C.B.
,
who
had
been
a
soldier
,
she
herself
having
also
been
a
Macleod
by
birth
;
and
for
very
many
years
past
 
from
a
time
previous
to
the
birth
of
Alice
Vavasor
 
<EOS>
she
had
lived
at
Cheltenham
,
making
short
sojourns
in
London
during
the
spring
,
when
the
contents
of
her
limited
purse
would
admit
of
her
doing
so
.
<EOS>
Of
old
Lady
Macleod
I
think
I
may
say
that
she
was
a
good
woman
;
 
that
she
was
a
good
woman
,
though
subject
to
two
of
the
most
serious
drawbacks
to
goodness
which
can
afflict
a
lady
.
<EOS>
She
was
a
Calvinistic
Sabbatarian
in
religion
,
and
in
worldly
matters
she
was
a
devout
believer
in
the
high
rank
of
her
noble
relatives
.
<EOS>
She
could
almost
worship
a
youthful
marquis
,
though
he
lived
a
life
that
would
disgrace
a
heathen
among
heathens
;
and
she
could
and
did
,
in
her
own
mind
,
condemn
crowds
of
commonplace
men
and
women
to
all
eternal
torments
of
which
her
imagination
could
conceive
,
because
they
listened
to
profane
music
in
a
park
on
Sunday
.
<EOS>
Yet
she
was
a
good
woman
.
<EOS>
Out
of
her
small
means
she
gave
much
away
.
<EOS>
She
owed
no
man
anything
.
<EOS>
She
strove
to
love
her
neighbours
.
<EOS>
She
bore
much
pain
with
calm
unspeaking
endurance
,
and
she
lived
in
trust
of
a
better
world
.
<EOS>
Alice
Vavasor
,
who
was
after
all
only
her
cousin
,
she
loved
with
an
exceeding
love
,
and
yet
Alice
had
done
very
much
to
extinguish
such
love
.
<EOS>
Alice
,
in
the
years
of
her
childhood
,
had
been
brought
up
by
Lady
Macleod
;
at
the
age
of
twelve
she
had
been
sent
to
a
school
at
Aix
-
la
-
Chapelle
,
 
a
comitatus
of
her
relatives
having
agreed
that
such
was
to
be
her
fate
,
much
in
opposition
to
Lady
Macleod
's
judgement
;
at
nineteen
she
had
returned
to
Cheltenham
,
and
after
remaining
there
for
little
more
than
a
year
,
had
expressed
her
unwillingness
to
remain
longer
with
her
cousin
.
<EOS>
She
could
sympathize
neither
with
her
relative
's
faults
or
virtues
.
<EOS>
She
made
an
arrangement
,
therefore
,
with
her
father
,
that
they
two
would
keep
house
together
in
London
,
and
so
they
had
lived
for
the
last
five
years
;
 
for
Alice
Vavasor
when
she
will
be
introduced
to
the
reader
had
already
passed
her
twenty
-
fourth
birthday
.
  
<EOS>
Their
mode
of
life
had
been
singular
and
certainly
not
in
all
respects
satisfactory
.
<EOS>
Alice
when
she
was
twenty
-
one
had
the
full
command
of
her
own
fortune
;
and
when
she
induced
her
father
,
who
for
the
last
fifteen
years
had
lived
in
lodgings
,
to
take
a
small
house
in
Queen
Anne
Street
,
of
course
she
offered
to
incur
a
portion
of
the
expense
.
<EOS>
He
had
warned
her
that
his
habits
were
not
those
of
a
domestic
man
,
but
he
had
been
content
simply
so
to
warn
her
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
felt
it
to
be
his
duty
to
decline
the
arrangement
because
he
knew
himself
to
be
unable
to
give
to
his
child
all
that
attention
which
a
widowed
father
under
such
circumstances
should
pay
to
an
only
daughter
.
<EOS>
The
house
had
been
taken
,
and
Alice
and
he
had
lived
together
,
but
their
lives
had
been
quite
apart
.
<EOS>
For
a
short
time
,
for
a
month
or
two
,
he
had
striven
to
dine
at
home
and
even
to
remain
at
home
through
the
evening
;
but
the
work
had
been
too
hard
for
him
<EOS>
and
he
had
utterly
broken
down
.
<EOS>
He
had
said
to
her
and
to
himself
that
his
health
would
fail
him
under
the
effects
of
so
great
a
change
made
so
late
in
life
,
and
I
am
not
sure
that
he
had
not
spoken
truly
.
<EOS>
At
any
rate
the
effort
had
been
abandoned
,
and
Mr.
Vavasor
now
never
dined
at
home
.
<EOS>
Nor
did
he
and
his
daughter
ever
dine
out
together
.
<EOS>
Their
joint
means
did
not
admit
of
their
giving
dinners
,
and
therefore
they
could
not
make
their
joint
way
in
the
same
circle
.
<EOS>
It
thus
came
to
pass
that
they
lived
apart
,
 
quite
apart
.
<EOS>
They
saw
each
other
,
probably
daily
;
but
they
did
little
more
than
see
each
other
.
<EOS>
They
did
not
even
breakfast
together
,
and
after
three
o'clock
in
the
day
Mr.
Vavasor
was
never
to
be
found
in
his
own
house
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Vavasor
had
made
for
herself
a
certain
footing
in
society
,
though
I
am
disposed
to
doubt
her
right
to
be
considered
as
holding
a
place
among
the
Upper
Ten
Thousand
.
<EOS>
Two
classes
of
people
she
had
chosen
to
avoid
,
having
been
driven
to
such
avoidings
by
her
aunt
's
preferences
;
marquises
and
such
-
like
,
whether
wicked
or
otherwise
,
she
had
eschewed
,
and
had
eschewed
likewise
all
Low
Church
tendencies
.
<EOS>
The
eschewing
of
marquises
is
not
generally
very
difficult
.
<EOS>
Young
ladies
living
with
their
fathers
on
very
moderate
incomes
in
or
about
Queen
Anne
Street
are
not
usually
much
troubled
on
that
matter
.
<EOS>
Nor
can
I
say
that
Miss
Vavasor
was
so
troubled
.
<EOS>
But
with
her
there
was
a
certain
definite
thing
to
be
done
towards
such
eschewal
.
<EOS>
Lady
Macleod
by
no
means
avoided
her
noble
relatives
,
nor
did
she
at
all
avoid
Alice
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
When
in
London
she
was
persevering
in
her
visits
to
Queen
Anne
Street
,
though
she
considered
herself
,
nobody
knew
why
,
not
to
be
on
speaking
terms
with
Mr.
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
And
she
strove
hard
to
produce
an
intimacy
between
Alice
and
her
noble
relatives
 
such
an
intimacy
as
that
which
she
herself
enjoyed
;
 
an
intimacy
which
gave
her
a
footing
in
their
houses
but
no
footing
in
their
hearts
,
or
even
in
their
habits
.
<EOS>
But
all
this
Alice
declined
with
as
much
consistency
as
she
did
those
other
struggles
which
her
old
cousin
made
on
her
behalf
,
 
strong
,
never
-
flagging
,
but
ever
-
failing
efforts
to
induce
the
girl
to
go
to
such
places
of
worship
as
Lady
Macleod
herself
frequented
.
  
<EOS>
A
few
words
must
be
said
as
to
Alice
Vavasor
's
person
;
one
fact
also
must
be
told
,
and
then
,
I
believe
,
I
may
start
upon
my
story
.
<EOS>
As
regards
her
character
,
I
will
leave
it
to
be
read
in
the
story
itself
.
<EOS>
The
reader
already
knows
that
she
appears
upon
the
scene
at
no
very
early
age
,
and
the
mode
of
her
life
had
perhaps
given
to
her
an
appearance
of
more
years
than
those
which
she
really
possessed
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
that
her
face
was
old
,
but
that
there
was
nothing
that
was
girlish
in
her
manners
.
<EOS>
Her
demeanour
was
as
staid
,
and
her
voice
as
self
-
possessed
as
though
she
had
already
been
ten
years
married
.
<EOS>
In
person
she
was
tall
and
well
made
,
rather
large
in
her
neck
and
shoulders
,
as
were
all
the
Vavasors
,
but
by
no
means
fat
.
<EOS>
Her
hair
was
brown
,
but
very
dark
,
and
she
wore
it
rather
lower
upon
her
forehead
than
is
customary
at
the
present
day
.
<EOS>
Her
eyes
,
too
,
were
dark
,
though
they
were
not
black
,
and
her
complexion
,
though
not
quite
that
of
a
brunette
,
was
far
away
from
being
fair
.
<EOS>
Her
nose
was
somewhat
broad
,
and
_
retroussé
_
too
,
but
to
my
thinking
it
was
a
charming
nose
,
full
of
character
,
and
giving
to
her
face
at
times
a
look
of
pleasant
humour
,
which
it
would
otherwise
have
lacked
.
<EOS>
Her
mouth
was
large
,
and
full
of
character
,
and
her
chin
oval
,
dimpled
,
and
finely
chiselled
,
like
her
father
's
.
<EOS>
I
beg
you
,
in
taking
her
for
all
in
all
,
to
admit
that
she
was
a
fine
,
handsome
,
high
-
spirited
young
woman
.
  
<EOS>
And
now
for
my
fact
.
<EOS>
At
the
time
of
which
I
am
writing
she
was
already
engaged
to
be
married
.
   
<EOS>
Lady
Macleod
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
say
that
the
house
in
Queen
Anne
Street
was
a
pleasant
house
.
<EOS>
I
am
now
speaking
of
the
material
house
,
made
up
of
the
walls
and
furniture
,
and
not
of
any
pleasantness
or
unpleasantness
supplied
by
the
inmates
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
small
house
on
the
south
side
of
the
street
,
squeezed
in
between
two
large
mansions
which
seemed
to
crush
it
,
and
by
which
its
fair
proportion
of
doorstep
and
area
was
in
truth
curtailed
.
<EOS>
The
stairs
were
narrow
;
the
dining
-
room
was
dark
,
and
possessed
none
of
those
appearances
of
plenteous
hospitality
which
a
dining
-
room
should
have
.
<EOS>
But
all
this
would
have
been
as
nothing
if
the
drawing
-
room
had
been
pretty
as
it
is
the
bounden
duty
of
all
drawing
-
rooms
to
be
.
<EOS>
But
Alice
Vavasor
's
drawing
-
room
was
not
pretty
.
<EOS>
Her
father
had
had
the
care
of
furnishing
the
house
,
and
he
had
intrusted
the
duty
to
a
tradesman
who
had
chosen
green
paper
,
a
green
carpet
,
green
curtains
,
and
green
damask
chairs
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
green
damask
sofa
,
and
two
green
arm
-
chairs
opposite
to
each
other
at
the
two
sides
of
the
fireplace
.
<EOS>
The
room
was
altogether
green
,
and
was
not
enticing
.
<EOS>
In
shape
it
was
nearly
square
,
the
very
small
back
room
on
the
same
floor
not
having
been
,
as
is
usual
,
added
to
it
.
<EOS>
This
had
been
fitted
up
as
a
"
study
"
for
Mr.
Vavasor
,
and
was
very
rarely
used
for
any
purpose
.
  
<EOS>
Most
of
us
know
when
we
enter
a
drawing
-
room
whether
it
is
a
pretty
room
or
no
;
but
how
few
of
us
know
how
to
make
a
drawing
-
room
pretty
!
<EOS>
There
has
come
up
in
London
in
these
latter
days
a
form
of
room
so
monstrously
ugly
that
I
will
venture
to
say
that
no
other
people
on
earth
but
Londoners
would
put
up
with
it
.
<EOS>
Londoners
,
as
a
rule
,
take
their
houses
as
they
can
get
them
,
looking
only
to
situation
,
size
,
and
price
.
<EOS>
What
Grecian
,
<EOS>
what
Roman
,
<EOS>
what
Turk
,
what
Italian
would
endure
,
or
would
ever
have
endured
,
to
use
a
room
with
a
monstrous
cantle
in
the
form
of
a
parallelogram
cut
sheerly
out
of
one
corner
of
it
?
<EOS>
This
is
the
shape
of
room
we
have
now
adopted
,
 
or
rather
which
the
builders
have
adopted
for
us
,
 
in
order
to
throw
the
whole
first
floor
into
one
apartment
which
may
be
presumed
to
have
noble
dimensions
,
 
with
such
drawback
from
it
as
the
necessities
of
the
staircase
may
require
.
<EOS>
A
sharp
unadorned
corner
projects
itself
into
these
would
-
be
noble
dimensions
,
and
as
ugly
a
form
of
chamber
is
produced
as
any
upon
which
the
eye
can
look
.
<EOS>
I
would
say
more
on
the
subject
if
I
dared
to
do
so
here
,
but
I
am
bound
now
to
confine
myself
to
Miss
Vavasor
's
room
.
<EOS>
The
monstrous
deformity
of
which
I
have
spoken
was
not
known
when
that
house
in
Queen
Anne
Street
was
built
.
<EOS>
There
is
to
be
found
no
such
abomination
of
shape
in
the
buildings
of
our
ancestors
,
 
not
even
in
the
days
of
George
the
Second
.
<EOS>
But
yet
the
drawing
-
room
of
which
I
speak
was
ugly
,
and
Alice
knew
that
it
was
so
.
<EOS>
She
knew
that
it
was
ugly
,
and
she
would
greatly
have
liked
to
banish
the
green
sofa
,
to
have
re
-
papered
the
wall
,
and
to
have
hung
up
curtains
with
a
dash
of
pink
through
them
.
<EOS>
With
the
green
carpet
she
would
have
been
contented
.
<EOS>
But
her
father
was
an
extravagant
man
;
and
from
the
day
on
which
she
had
come
of
age
she
had
determined
that
it
was
her
special
duty
to
avoid
extravagance
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
the
ugliest
room
I
ever
saw
in
my
life
,
"
her
father
once
said
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
very
pretty
,
"
Alice
replied
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
go
halves
with
you
in
the
expense
of
redoing
it
,
"
said
Mr.
Vavasor
.
  
<EOS>
"
Would
n't
that
be
extravagant
,
papa
?
<EOS>
The
things
have
not
been
here
quite
four
years
yet
.
"
  
<EOS>
Then
Mr.
Vavasor
had
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
said
nothing
more
about
it
.
<EOS>
It
was
little
to
him
whether
the
drawing
-
room
in
Queen
Anne
Street
was
ugly
or
pretty
.
<EOS>
He
was
on
the
committee
of
his
club
,
and
he
took
care
that
the
furniture
there
should
be
in
all
respects
comfortable
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
now
June
;
and
that
month
Lady
Macleod
was
in
the
habit
of
spending
among
her
noble
relatives
in
London
when
she
had
succeeded
in
making
both
ends
so
far
overlap
each
other
at
Cheltenham
as
to
give
her
the
fifty
pounds
necessary
for
this
purpose
.
<EOS>
For
though
she
spent
her
month
in
London
among
her
noble
friends
,
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
her
noble
friends
gave
her
bed
or
board
.
<EOS>
They
sometimes
gave
her
tea
,
such
as
it
was
,
and
once
or
twice
in
the
month
they
gave
the
old
lady
a
second
-
rate
dinner
.
<EOS>
On
these
occasions
she
hired
a
little
parlour
and
bedroom
behind
it
in
King
Street
,
Saint
James
's
,
and
lived
a
hot
,
uncomfortable
life
,
going
about
at
nights
to
gatherings
of
fashionable
people
of
which
she
in
her
heart
disapproved
,
seeking
for
smiles
which
seldom
came
to
her
,
and
which
she
excused
herself
for
desiring
because
they
were
the
smiles
of
her
kith
and
her
kin
,
telling
herself
always
that
she
made
this
vain
journey
to
the
modern
Babylon
for
the
good
of
Alice
Vavasor
,
and
telling
herself
as
often
that
she
now
made
it
for
the
last
time
.
<EOS>
On
the
occasion
of
her
preceding
visit
she
had
reminded
herself
that
she
was
then
seventy
-
five
years
old
,
and
had
sworn
to
herself
that
she
would
come
to
London
no
more
;
but
here
she
was
again
in
London
,
having
justified
the
journey
to
herself
on
the
plea
that
there
were
circumstances
in
Alice
's
engagement
which
made
it
desirable
that
she
should
for
a
while
be
near
her
niece
.
<EOS>
Her
niece
,
as
she
thought
,
was
hardly
managing
her
own
affairs
discreetly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
aunt
,
"
said
Alice
,
as
the
old
lady
walked
into
the
drawing
-
room
one
morning
at
eleven
o'clock
.
<EOS>
Alice
always
called
Lady
Macleod
her
aunt
,
though
,
as
has
been
before
explained
,
there
was
no
such
close
connexion
between
them
.
<EOS>
During
Lady
Macleod
's
sojourn
in
London
these
morning
visits
were
made
almost
every
day
.
<EOS>
Alice
never
denied
herself
,
and
even
made
a
point
of
remaining
at
home
to
receive
them
unless
she
had
previously
explained
that
she
would
be
out
;
but
I
am
not
prepared
to
say
that
they
were
,
of
their
own
nature
,
agreeable
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Would
you
mind
shutting
the
window
,
my
dear
?
"
said
Lady
Macleod
,
seating
herself
stiffly
on
one
of
the
small
ugly
green
chairs
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
educated
at
a
time
when
easy
-
chairs
were
considered
vicious
,
and
among
people
who
regarded
all
easy
postures
as
being
so
;
and
she
could
still
boast
,
at
seventy
-
six
,
that
she
never
leaned
back
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Would
you
mind
shutting
the
window
?
<EOS>
I
'm
so
warm
that
I
'm
afraid
of
the
draught
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
mean
to
say
that
you
've
walked
from
King
Street
,
"
said
Alice
,
doing
as
she
was
desired
.
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
I
do
,
 
every
step
of
the
way
.
<EOS>
Cabs
are
so
ruinous
.
<EOS>
It
's
a
most
unfortunate
thing
;
they
always
say
it
's
just
over
the
two
miles
here
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
believe
a
word
of
it
,
because
I
'm
only
a
little
more
than
the
half
-
hour
walking
it
;
and
those
men
will
say
anything
.
<EOS>
But
how
can
I
prove
it
,
you
know
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
really
think
it
's
too
far
for
you
to
walk
when
it
's
so
warm
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
what
can
I
do
,
my
dear
?
<EOS>
I
must
come
,
when
I
've
specially
come
up
to
London
to
see
you
.
<EOS>
I
shall
have
a
cab
back
again
,
because
it
'll
be
hotter
then
,
and
dear
Lady
Midlothian
has
promised
to
send
her
carriage
at
three
to
take
me
to
the
concert
.
<EOS>
I
do
so
wish
you
'd
go
,
Alice
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
out
of
the
question
,
aunt
.
<EOS>
The
idea
of
my
going
in
that
way
at
the
last
moment
,
without
any
invitation
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
would
n't
be
without
an
invitation
,
Alice
.
<EOS>
The
marchioness
has
said
to
me
over
and
over
again
how
glad
she
would
be
to
see
you
,
if
I
would
bring
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
does
n't
she
come
and
call
if
she
is
so
anxious
to
know
me
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
you
've
no
right
to
expect
it
;
you
have
n't
indeed
.
<EOS>
She
never
calls
even
on
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
I
've
no
right
,
and
I
do
n't
expect
it
,
and
I
do
n't
want
it
.
<EOS>
But
neither
has
she
a
right
to
suppose
that
,
under
such
circumstances
,
I
shall
go
to
her
house
.
<EOS>
You
might
as
well
give
it
up
,
aunt
.
<EOS>
Cart
ropes
would
n't
drag
me
there
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
are
very
wrong
,
 
particularly
under
your
present
circumstances
.
<EOS>
A
young
woman
that
is
going
to
be
married
,
as
you
are
 
"
  
<EOS>
"
As
I
am
,
 
perhaps
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
nonsense
,
Alice
.
<EOS>
Of
course
you
are
;
and
for
his
sake
you
are
bound
to
cultivate
any
advantages
that
naturally
belong
to
you
.
<EOS>
As
to
Lady
Midlothian
or
the
marchioness
coming
to
call
on
you
here
in
your

all
that

you
really
have
no
right
to
look

<EOS>

And
I
do
n't
look
for
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
sort
of
people
are
not
expected
to
call

If
you
'll
think
of
it
,
how
could
they
do
it
with
all
the
demands
they
have
on
their
time

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
aunt
,
I
would
n't
interfere
with
their
time
for
worlds
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nobody
can
say
of
me
,
<EOS>
I
'm
sure
,
that
I
run
after
great
people
or
rich
people
.
<EOS>
It
does
happen
that
some
of
the
nearest
relations
I
have
,
 
<EOS>
indeed
I
may
say
the
nearest
relations
,
 
are
people
of
high
rank
;
and
I
do
not
see
that
I
'm
bound
to
turn
away
from
my
own
flesh
and
blood
because
of
that
,
particularly
when
they
are
always
so
anxious
to
keep
up
the
connexion
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
only
speaking
of
myself
,
aunt
.
<EOS>
It
is
very
different
with
you
.
<EOS>
You
have
known
them
all
your
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
how
are
you
to
know
them
if
you
wo
n't
begin
?
<EOS>
Lady
Midlothian
said
to
me
only
yesterday
that
she
was
glad
to
hear
that
you
were
going
to
be
married
so
respectably
,
and
then
 
"
  
"
Upon
my
word
I
'm
very
much
obliged
to
her
ladyship
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
whether
she
considered
that
she
married
respectably
when
she
took
Lord
Midlothian
?
"
  
<EOS>
Now
Lady
Midlothian
had
been
unfortunate
in
her
marriage
,
having
united
herself
to
a
man
of
bad
character
,
who
had
used
her
ill
,
and
from
whom
she
had
now
been
for
some
years
separated
.
<EOS>
Alice
might
have
spared
her
allusion
to
this
misfortune
when
speaking
of
the
countess
to
the
cousin
who
was
so
fond
of
her
,
but
she
was
angered
by
the
application
of
that
odious
word
respectable
to
her
own
prospects
;
and
perhaps
the
more
angered
as
she
was
somewhat
inclined
to
feel
that
the
epithet
did
suit
her
own
position
.
<EOS>
Her
engagement
,
she
had
sometimes
told
herself
,
was
very
respectable
,
and
had
as
often
told
herself
that
it
lacked
other
attractions
which
it
should
have
possessed
.
<EOS>
She
was
not
quite
pleased
with
herself
in
having
accepted
John
Grey
,
 
or
rather
perhaps
was
not
satisfied
with
herself
in
having
loved
him
.
<EOS>
In
her
many
thoughts
on
the
subject
,
she
always
admitted
to
herself
that
she
had
accepted
him
simply
because
she
loved
him
;
 
that
she
had
given
her
quick
assent
to
his
quick
proposal
simply
because
he
had
won
her
heart
.
<EOS>
But
she
was
sometimes
almost
angry
with
herself
that
she
had
permitted
her
heart
to
be
thus
easily
taken
from
her
,
and
had
rebuked
herself
for
her
girlish
facility
.
<EOS>
But
the
marriage
would
be
at
any
rate
respectable
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Grey
was
a
man
of
high
character
,
of
good
though
moderate
means
;
he
was
,
too
,
well
educated
,
of
good
birth
,
a
gentleman
,
and
a
man
of
talent
.
<EOS>
No
one
could
deny
that
the
marriage
would
be
highly
respectable
,
and
her
father
had
been
more
than
satisfied
.
<EOS>
Why
Miss
Vavasor
herself
was
not
quite
satisfied
will
<EOS>
,
I
hope
,
in
time
make
itself
appear
.
<EOS>
In
the
meanwhile
it
can
be
understood
that
Lady
Midlothian
's
praise
would
gall
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Alice
,
do
n't
be
uncharitable
,
"
said
Lady
Macleod
severely
.
<EOS>
"
Whatever
may
have
been
Lady
Midlothian
's
misfortunes
<EOS>
no
one
can
say
they
have
resulted
from
her
own
fault
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
they
can
,
aunt
,
if
she
married
a
man
whom
she
knew
to
be
a
scapegrace
because
he
was
very
rich
and
an
earl
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
was
the
daughter
of
a
nobleman
herself
,
and
only
married
in
her
own
degree
.
<EOS>
But
I
do
n't
want
to
discuss
that
.
<EOS>
She
meant
to
be
good
-
natured
when
she
mentioned
your
marriage
,
and
you
should
take
it
as
it
was
meant
.
<EOS>
After
all
she
was
only
your
mother
's
second
cousin
 
"
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
aunt
,
I
make
no
claim
on
her
cousinship
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
she
admits
the
claim
,
and
is
quite
anxious
that
you
should
know
her
.
<EOS>
She
has
been
at
the
trouble
to
find
out
everything
about
Mr.
Grey
,
and
told
me
that
nothing
could
be
more
satisfactory
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
word
I
am
very
much
obliged
to
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lady
Macleod
was
a
woman
of
much
patience
,
and
possessed
also
of
considerable
perseverance
.
<EOS>
For
another
half
-
hour
she
went
on
expatiating
on
the
advantages
which
would
accrue
to
Alice
as
a
married
woman
from
an
acquaintance
with
her
noble
relatives
,
and
endeavouring
to
persuade
her
that
no
better
opportunity
than
the
present
would
present
itself
.
<EOS>
There
would
be
a
place
in
Lady
Midlothian
's
carriage
,
as
none
other
of
the
daughters
were
going
but
Lady
Jane
.
<EOS>
Lady
Midlothian
would
take
it
quite
as
a
compliment
,
and
a
concert
was
not
like
a
ball
or
any
customary
party
.
<EOS>
An
unmarried
girl
might
very
properly
go
to
a
concert
under
such
circumstances
as
now
existed
without
any
special
invitation
.
<EOS>
Lady
Macleod
ought
to
have
known
her
adopted
niece
better
.
<EOS>
Alice
was
immoveable
.
<EOS>
As
a
matter
of
course
she
was
immoveable
.
<EOS>
Lady
Macleod
had
seldom
been
able
to
persuade
her
to
anything
,
and
ought
to
have
been
well
sure
that
,
of
all
things
,
she
could
not
have
persuaded
her
to
this
.
  
<EOS>
Then
,
at
last
,
they
came
to
another
subject
,
as
to
which
Lady
Macleod
declared
that
she
had
specially
come
on
this
special
morning
,
forgetting
,
probably
,
that
she
had
already
made
the
same
assertion
with
reference
to
the
concert
.
<EOS>
But
in
truth
the
last
assertion
was
the
correct
one
,
and
on
that
other
subject
she
had
been
hurried
on
to
say
more
than
she
meant
by
the
eagerness
of
the
moment
.
<EOS>
All
the
morning
she
had
been
full
of
the
matter
on
which
she
was
now
about
to
speak
.
<EOS>
She
had
discussed
it
quite
at
length
with
Lady
Midlothian
;
 
though
she
was
by
no
means
prepared
to
tell
Alice
Vavasor
that
any
such
discussion
had
taken
place
.
<EOS>
From
the
concert
,
and
the
effect
which
Lady
Midlothian
's
countenance
might
have
upon
Mr.
Grey
's
future
welfare
,
she
got
herself
by
degrees
round
to
a
projected
Swiss
tour
which
Alice
was
about
to
make
.
<EOS>
Of
this
Swiss
tour
she
had
heard
before
,
but
had
not
heard
who
were
to
be
Miss
Vavasor
's
companions
until
Lady
Midlothian
had
told
her
.
<EOS>
How
it
had
come
to
pass
that
Lady
Midlothian
had
interested
herself
so
much
in
the
concerns
of
a
person
whom
she
did
not
know
,
and
on
whom
she
in
her
greatness
could
not
be
expected
to
call
,
I
can
not
say
;
but
from
some
quarter
she
had
learned
who
were
the
proposed
companions
of
Alice
Vavasor
's
tour
,
and
she
had
told
Lady
Macleod
that
she
did
not
at
all
approve
of
the
arrangement
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
when
do
you
go
,
Alice
?
"
said
Lady
Macleod
.
  
<EOS>
"
Early
in
July
,
I
believe
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
very
hot
,
but
Kate
must
be
back
by
the
middle
of
August
.
"
<EOS>
Kate
Vavasor
was
Alice
's
first
cousin
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
<EOS>
Kate
is
to
go
with
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
she
is
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
go
alone
,
or
with
no
one
but
George
.
<EOS>
Indeed
it
was
Kate
who
made
up
the
party
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
you
could
not
go
alone
with
George
,
"
said
Lady
Macleod
,
very
grimly
.
<EOS>
Now
George
Vavasor
was
Kate
's
brother
,
and
was
therefore
also
first
cousin
to
Alice
.
<EOS>
He
was
heir
to
the
old
squire
down
in
Westmoreland
,
with
whom
Kate
lived
,
their
father
being
dead
.
<EOS>
Nothing
,
it
would
seem
,
could
be
more
rational
than
that
Alice
should
go
to
Switzerland
with
her
cousins
;
but
Lady
Macleod
was
clearly
not
of
this
opinion
;
she
looked
very
grim
as
she
made
this
allusion
to
cousin
George
,
and
seemed
to
be
preparing
herself
for
a
fight
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
exactly
what
I
say
,
"
answered
Alice
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
,
indeed
,
he
is
simply
going
as
an
escort
to
me
and
Kate
,
as
we
do
n't
like
the
rôle
of
unprotected
females
.
<EOS>
It
is
very
good
-
natured
of
him
,
seeing
how
much
his
time
is
taken
up
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
thought
he
never
did
anything
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
because
you
do
n't
know
him
,
aunt
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
certainly
I
do
n't
know
him
.
<EOS>
"
She
did
not
add
that
she
had
no
wish
to
know
Mr.
George
Vavasor
,
but
she
looked
it
.
"
<EOS>
And
has
your
father
been
told
that
he
is
going
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
he
has
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
does
 
"
Lady
Macleod
hesitated
a
little
before
she
went
on
,
and
then
finished
her
question
with
a
little
spasmodic
assumption
of
courage
.
"
<EOS>
And
does
Mr.
Grey
know
that
he
is
going
?
"
  
<EOS>
Alice
remained
silent
for
a
full
minute
before
she
answered
this
question
,
during
which
Lady
Macleod
sat
watching
her
grimly
,
with
her
eyes
very
intent
upon
her
niece
's
face
.
<EOS>
If
she
supposed
such
silence
to
have
been
in
any
degree
produced
by
shame
in
answering
the
question
,
she
was
much
mistaken
.
<EOS>
But
it
may
be
doubted
whether
she
understood
the
character
of
the
girl
whom
she
thought
she
knew
so
well
,
and
it
is
probable
that
she
did
make
such
mistake
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
might
tell
you
simply
that
he
does
,
"
said
Alice
at
last
,
"
seeing
that
I
wrote
to
him
yesterday
,
letting
him
know
that
such
were
our
arrangements
;
but
I
feel
that
I
should
not
thus
answer
the
question
you
mean
to
ask
.
<EOS>
You
want
to
know
whether
Mr.
Grey
will
approve
of
it
.
<EOS>
As
I
only
wrote
yesterday
of
course
I
have
not
heard
,
and
therefore
can
not
say
.
<EOS>
But
I
can
say
this
,
aunt
,
that
much
as
I
might
regret
his
disapproval
,
it
would
make
no
change
in
my
plans
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Would
it
not
?
<EOS>
Then
I
must
tell
you
,
you
are
very
wrong
.
<EOS>
It
ought
to
make
a
change
.
<EOS>
What
!
<EOS>
the
disapproval
of
the
man
you
are
going
to
marry
make
no
change
in
your
plans
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Not
in
that
matter
.
<EOS>
Come
,
aunt
,
if
we
must
discuss
this
matter
<EOS>
let
us
do
it
at
any
rate
fairly
.
<EOS>
In
an
ordinary
way
,
if
Mr.
Grey
had
asked
me
to
give
up
for
any
reason
my
trip
altogether
,
I
should
have
given
it
up
certainly
,
as
I
would
give
up
any
other
indifferent
project
at
the
request
of
so
dear
a
friend
,
 
a
friend
with
whom
I
am
<EOS>
so
 
so
 
so
closely
connected
.
<EOS>
But
if
he
asked
me
not
to
travel
with
my
cousin
George
,
I
should
refuse
him
absolutely
,
without
a
word
of
parley
on
the
subject
,
simply
because
of
the
nature
and
closeness
of
my
connection
with
him
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
you
understand
what
I
mean
,
aunt
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
I
do
.
<EOS>
You
mean
that
you
would
refuse
to
obey
him
on
the
very
subject
on
which
he
has
a
right
to
claim
your
obedience
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
has
no
right
to
claim
my
obedience
on
any
subject
,
"
said
Alice
;
and
as
she
spoke
Aunt
Macleod
jumped
up
with
a
little
start
at
the
vehemence
of
the
words
,
and
of
the
tone
in
which
they
were
expressed
.
<EOS>
She
had
heard
that
tone
before
,
and
might
have
been
used
to
it
;
but
,
nevertheless
,
the
little
jump
was
involuntary
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
At
present
he
has
no
right
to
my
obedience
on
any
subject
,
but
least
of
all
on
that
,
"
said
Alice
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
His
advice
he
may
give
me
,
but
I
am
quite
sure
he
will
not
ask
for
obedience
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
if
he
advises
you
you
will
slight
his
advice
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
he
tells
me
that
I
had
better
not
travel
with
my
cousin
George
I
shall
certainly
not
take
his
advice
.
<EOS>
Moreover
,
I
should
be
careful
to
let
him
know
how
much
I
was
offended
by
any
such
counsel
from
him
.
<EOS>
It
would
show
a
littleness
on
his
part
,
and
a
suspicion
of
which
I
can
not
suppose
him
to
be
capable
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Alice
,
as
she
said
this
,
got
up
from
her
seat
and
walked
about
the
room
.
<EOS>
When
she
had
finished
she
stood
at
one
of
the
windows
with
her
back
to
her
visitor
.
<EOS>
There
was
silence
between
them
for
a
minute
or
two
,
during
which
Lady
Macleod
was
deeply
considering
how
best
she
might
speak
the
terrible
words
,
which
,
as
Alice
's
nearest
female
relative
,
she
felt
herself
bound
to
utter
.
<EOS>
At
last
she
collected
her
thoughts
and
her
courage
,
and
spoke
out
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Alice
,
I
need
hardly
say
that
if
you
had
a
mother
living
,
or
any
person
with
you
filling
the
place
of
a
mother
,
I
should
not
interfere
in
this
matter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
,
Aunt
Macleod
,
if
you
think
I
am
wrong
you
have
quite
a
right
to
say
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
think
you
are
wrong
,
 
very
wrong
,
indeed
;
and
if
you
persist
in
this
I
am
afraid
I
must
say
that
I
shall
think
you
wicked
.

Of
course
Mr.
Grey
can
not
like
you
to
travel
with
George
Vavasor

And
why
not

<EOS>
Alice
,
as
she
asked
this
question
,
turned
round
and
confronted
Lady
Macleod
boldly
.
<EOS>
She
spoke
with
a
steady
voice
,
and
fixed
her
eyes
upon
the
old
lady
's
face
,
as
though
determined
to
show
that
she
had
no
fear
of
what
might
be
said
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
not
,
Alice
?
<EOS>
Surely
you
do
not
wish
me
to
say
why
not
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
do
wish
you
to
say
why
not
.
<EOS>
How
can
I
defend
myself
till
the
accusation
is
made
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
now
engaged
to
marry
Mr.
Grey
,
with
the
consent
and
approbation
of
all
your
friends
.
<EOS>
Two
years
ago
you
had
 
<EOS>
had
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
Had
what
,
aunt
?
<EOS>
If
you
mean
to
say
that
two
years
ago
I
was
engaged
to
my
cousin
George
<EOS>
you
are
mistaken
.
<EOS>
Three
years
ago
I
told
him
that
under
certain
conditions
I
would
become
engaged
to
him
.
<EOS>
But
my
conditions
did
not
suit
him
,
nor
his
me
,
and
no
engagement
was
ever
made
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Grey
knows
the
history
of
the
whole
thing
.
<EOS>
As
far
as
it
was
possible
I
have
told
him
everything
that
took
place
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
fact
was
,
Alice
,
that
George
Vavasor
's
mode
of
life
was
such
that
an
engagement
with
him
would
have
been
absolute
madness
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
aunt
,
you
must
excuse
me
if
I
say
that
I
can
not
discuss
George
Vavasor
's
mode
of
life
.
<EOS>
If
I
were
thinking
of
becoming
his
wife
you
would
have
a
perfect
right
to
discuss
it
,
because
of
your
constant
kindness
to
me
.
<EOS>
But
as
matters
are
he
is
simply
a
cousin
;
and
as
I
like
him
<EOS>
and
you
do
not
,
we
had
better
say
nothing
about
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
say
this
 
that
after
what
has
passed
,
and
at
the
present
crisis
of
your
life
 
"
  
"
Dear
aunt
,
I
'm
not
in
any
crisis
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
you
are
,
Alice
;
in
the
most
special
crisis
of
a
girl
's
life
.
<EOS>
You
are
still
a
girl
,
but
you
are
the
promised
wife
of
a
very
worthy
man
,
who
will
look
to
you
for
all
his
domestic
happiness
.
<EOS>
George
Vavasor
has
the
name
,
at
least
,
of
being
very
wild
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
worthy
man
and
the
wild
man
must
fight
it
out
between
them
.
<EOS>
If
I
were
going
away
with
George
by
himself
,
there
might
be
something
in
what
you
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
That
would
be
monstrous
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Monstrous
or
not
<EOS>
,
it
is
n't
what
I
'm
about
to
do
.
<EOS>
Kate
and
I
have
put
our
purses
together
,
and
are
going
to
have
an
outing
for
our
special
fun
and
gratification
.
<EOS>
As
we
should
be
poor
travellers
alone
,
George
has
promised
to
go
with
his
sister
.
<EOS>
Papa
knows
all
about
it
,
and
never
thought
of
making
any
objection
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lady
Macleod
shook
her
head
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
like
to
say
anything
against
Mr.
Vavasor
before
his
daughter
;
but
the
shaking
of
her
head
was
intended
to
signify
that
Mr.
Vavasor
's
assent
in
such
a
matter
was
worth
nothing
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
only
say
again
,
"
said
Lady
Macleod
,
"
that
I
think
Mr.
Grey
will
be
displeased
,
 
and
that
he
will
have
very
great
cause
for
displeasure
.
<EOS>
And
I
think
,
moreover
,
that
his
approbation
ought
to
be
your
chief
study
.
<EOS>
I
believe
,
my
dear
,
I
'll
ask
you
to
let
Jane
get
me
a
cab
.
<EOS>
I
sha
n't
have
a
bit
too
much
time
to
dress
for
the
concert
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Alice
simply
rang
the
bell
,
and
said
no
further
word
on
the
subject
which
they
had
been
discussing
.
<EOS>
When
Lady
Macleod
got
up
to
go
away
,
Alice
kissed
her
,
as
was
customary
with
them
,
and
the
old
lady
as
she
went
uttered
her
customary
valediction
.
<EOS>
"
God
bless
you
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
Good
-
bye
!
<EOS>
I
'll
come
to
-
morrow
if
I
can
.
<EOS>
"
There
was
therefore
no
quarrel
between
them
.
<EOS>
But
both
of
them
felt
that
words
had
been
spoken
which
must
probably
lead
to
some
diminution
of
their
past
intimacy
.
  
<EOS>
When
Lady
Macleod
had
gone
Alice
sat
alone
for
an
hour
thinking
of
what
had
passed
between
them
,
 
thinking
rather
of
those
two
men
,
the
worthy
man
and
the
wild
man
,
whose
names
had
been
mentioned
in
close
connection
with
herself
.
<EOS>
John
Grey
was
a
worthy
man
,
a
man
worthy
at
all
points
,
as
far
as
she
knew
him
.
<EOS>
She
told
herself
it
was
so
.
<EOS>
And
she
told
herself
,
also
,
that
her
cousin
George
was
wild
,
 
very
wild
.
<EOS>
And
yet
her
thoughts
were
,
I
fear
,
on
the
whole
more
kindly
towards
her
cousin
than
towards
her
lover
.
<EOS>
She
had
declared
to
her
aunt
that
John
Grey
would
be
incapable
of
such
suspicion
as
would
be
shown
by
any
objection
on
his
part
to
the
arrangements
made
for
the
tour
.
<EOS>
She
had
said
so
,
and
had
so
believed
;
and
yet
she
continued
to
brood
over
the
position
which
her
affairs
would
take
,
if
he
did
make
the
objection
which
Lady
Macleod
anticipated
.
<EOS>
She
told
herself
over
and
over
again
,
that
under
such
circumstances
she
would
not
give
way
an
inch
.
"
<EOS>
He
is
free
to
go
,
"
she
said
to
herself
.
<EOS>
"
If
he
does
not
trust
me
he
is
quite
free
to
go
.
<EOS>
"
It
may
almost
be
said
that
she
came
at
last
to
anticipate
from
her
lover
that
very
answer
to
her
own
letter
which
she
had
declared
him
to
be
incapable
of
making
.
   
<EOS>
John
Grey
,
the
Worthy
Man
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Grey
's
answer
to
Alice
Vavasor
's
letter
,
which
was
duly
sent
by
return
of
post
and
duly
received
on
the
morning
after
Lady
Macleod
's
visit
,
may
perhaps
be
taken
as
giving
a
sample
of
his
worthiness
.
<EOS>
It
was
dated
from
Nethercoats
,
a
small
country
-
house
in
Cambridgeshire
which
belonged
to
him
,
at
which
he
already
spent
much
of
his
time
,
and
at
which
he
intended
to
live
altogether
after
his
marriage
.
  
<EOS>
Nethercoats
,
June
,
186
 
.
  
<EOS>
DEAREST
ALICE
,
  
<EOS>
I
am
glad
you
have
settled
your
affairs
,
 
foreign
affairs
,
I
mean
,
 
so
much
to
your
mind
.
<EOS>
As
to
your
home
affairs
they
are
not
,
to
my
thinking
,
quite
so
satisfactorily
arranged
.
<EOS>
But
as
I
am
a
party
interested
in
the
latter
<EOS>
my
opinion
may
perhaps
have
an
undue
bias
.
<EOS>
Touching
the
tour
,
I
quite
agree
with
you
that
you
and
Kate
would
have
been
uncomfortable
alone
.
<EOS>
It
's
a
very
fine
theory
,
that
of
women
being
able
to
get
along
without
men
as
well
as
with
them
;
but
,
like
other
fine
theories
,
it
will
be
found
very
troublesome
by
those
who
first
put
it
in
practice
.
<EOS>
Gloved
hands
,
petticoats
,
feminine
softness
,
and
the
general
homage
paid
to
beauty
,
all
stand
in
the
way
of
success
.
<EOS>
These
things
may
perhaps
some
day
be
got
rid
of
,
and
possibly
with
advantage
;
but
while
young
ladies
are
still
encumbered
with
them
a
male
companion
will
always
be
found
to
be
a
comfort
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
quite
know
whether
your
cousin
George
is
the
best
possible
knight
you
might
have
chosen
.
<EOS>
I
should
consider
myself
to
be
infinitely
preferable
,
had
my
going
been
upon
the
cards
.
<EOS>
Were
you
in
danger
of
meeting
Paynim
foes
,
he
,
no
doubt
,
would
kill
them
off
much
quicker
than
I
could
do
,
and
would
be
much
more
serviceable
in
liberating
you
from
the
dungeons
of
oppressors
,
or
even
from
stray
tigers
in
the
Swiss
forests
.
<EOS>
But
I
doubt
his
being
punctual
with
the
luggage
.
<EOS>
He
will
want
you
or
Kate
to
keep
the
accounts
,
if
any
are
kept
.
<EOS>
He
will
be
slow
in
getting
you
glasses
of
water
at
the
railway
stations
,
and
will
always
keep
you
waiting
at
breakfast
.
<EOS>
I
hold
that
a
man
with
two
ladies
on
a
tour
should
be
an
absolute
slave
to
them
,
or
they
will
not
fully
enjoy
themselves
.
<EOS>
He
should
simply
be
an
upper
servant
,
with
the
privilege
of
sitting
at
the
same
table
with
his
mistresses
.
<EOS>
I
have
my
doubts
as
to
whether
your
cousin
is
fit
for
the
place
;
but
,
as
to
myself
,
it
is
just
the
thing
that
I
was
made
for
.
<EOS>
Luckily
,
however
,
neither
you
nor
Kate
are
without
wills
of
your
own
,
and
perhaps
you
may
be
able
to
reduce
Mr.
Vavasor
to
obedience
.
  
<EOS>
As
to
the
home
affairs
I
have
very
little
to
say
here
,
 
in
this
letter
.
<EOS>
I
shall
of
course
run
up
and
see
you
before
you
start
,
and
shall
probably
stay
a
week
in
town
.
<EOS>
I
know
I
ought
not
to
do
so
,
as
it
will
be
a
week
of
idleness
,
and
yet
not
a
week
of
happiness
.
<EOS>
I
'd
sooner
have
an
hour
with
you
in
the
country
than
a
whole
day
in
London
.
<EOS>
And
I
always
feel
in
town
that
I
've
too
much
to
do
to
allow
of
my
doing
anything
.
<EOS>
If
it
were
sheer
idleness
I
could
enjoy
it
,
but
it
is
a
feverish
idleness
,
in
which
one
is
driven
here
and
there
,
expecting
some
gratification
which
not
only
never
comes
,
but
which
never
even
begins
to
come
.
<EOS>
I
will
,
however
,
undergo
a
week
of
it
,
 
say
the
last
seven
days
of
this
month
,
and
shall
trust
to
you
to
recompense
me
by
as
much
of
yourself
as
your
town
doings
will
permit
.
  
<EOS>
And
now
again
as
to
those
home
affairs
.
<EOS>
If
I
say
nothing
now
I
believe
you
will
understand
why
I
refrain
.
<EOS>
You
have
cunningly
just
left
me
to
imply
,
from
what
you
say
,
that
all
my
arguments
have
been
of
no
avail
;
but
you
do
not
answer
them
,
or
even
tell
me
that
you
have
decided
.
<EOS>
I
shall
therefore
imply
nothing
,
and
still
trust
to
my
personal
eloquence
for
success
.
<EOS>
Or
rather
not
trust
,
 
not
trust
,
but
hope
.
  
<EOS>
The
garden
is
going
on
very
well
.
<EOS>
We
are
rather
short
of
water
,
and
therefore
not
quite
as
bright
as
I
had
hoped
;
but
we
are
preparing
with
untiring
industry
for
future
brightness
.
<EOS>
Your
commands
have
been
obeyed
in
all
things
,
and
Morrison
always
says
"
The
mistress
did
n't
mean
this
,
"
or
"
The
mistress
did
intend
that
.
"
<EOS>
God
bless
the
mistress
is
what
I
now
say
,
and
send
her
home
,
to
her
own
home
,
to
her
flowers
,
and
her
fruit
,
and
her
house
,
and
her
husband
,
as
soon
as
may
be
,
with
no
more
of
these
delays
which
are
to
me
so
grievous
,
and
which
seem
to
me
to
be
so
unnecessary
.
<EOS>
That
is
my
prayer
.
  
<EOS>
Yours
ever
and
always
,
  
J.
G.
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
give
commands
,
"
Alice
said
to
herself
,
as
she
sat
with
the
letter
at
her
solitary
breakfast
-
table
.
"
<EOS>
He
asked
me
how
I
liked
the
things
,
and
of
course
I
was
obliged
to
say
.
<EOS>
I
was
obliged
to
seem
to
care
,
even
if
I
did
n't
care
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Such
were
her
first
thoughts
as
she
put
the
letter
back
into
its
envelope
,
after
reading
it
the
second
time
.
<EOS>
When
she
opened
it
,
which
she
did
quickly
,
not
pausing
a
moment
lest
she
should
suspect
herself
of
fearing
to
see
what
might
be
its
contents
,
her
mind
was
full
of
that
rebuke
which
her
aunt
had
anticipated
,
and
which
she
had
almost
taught
herself
to
expect
.
<EOS>
She
had
torn
the
letter
open
rapidly
,
and
had
dashed
at
its
contents
with
quick
eyes
.
<EOS>
In
half
a
moment
she
had
seen
what
was
the
nature
of
the
reply
respecting
the
proposed
companion
of
her
tour
,
and
then
she
had
completed
her
reading
slowly
enough
.
"
<EOS>
No
;
I
gave
no
commands
,
"
she
repeated
to
herself
,
as
though
she
might
thereby
absolve
herself
from
blame
in
reference
to
some
possible
future
accusations
,
which
might
perhaps
be
brought
against
her
under
certain
circumstances
which
she
was
contemplating
.
  
<EOS>
Then
she
considered
the
letter
bit
by
bit
,
taking
it
backwards
,
and
sipping
her
tea
every
now
<EOS>
and
then
amidst
her
thoughts
.
<EOS>
No
;
she
had
no
home
,
no
house
,
there
.
<EOS>
She
had
no
husband
;
 
not
as
yet
.
<EOS>
He
spoke
of
their
engagement
as
though
it
were
a
betrothal
,
as
betrothals
used
to
be
of
yore
;
as
though
they
were
already
in
some
sort
married
.
<EOS>
Such
betrothals
were
not
made
now
-
a
-
days
.
<EOS>
There
still
remained
,
both
to
him
and
to
her
,
a
certain
liberty
of
extricating
themselves
from
this
engagement
.
<EOS>
Should
he
come
to
her
and
say
that
he
found
that
their
contemplated
marriage
would
not
make
him
happy
<EOS>
,
would
not
she
release
him
without
a
word
of
reproach
?
<EOS>
Would
not
she
regard
him
as
much
more
honourable
in
doing
so
than
in
adhering
to
a
marriage
which
was
distasteful
to
him
?
<EOS>
And
if
she
would
so
judge
him
,
 
judge
him
and
certainly
acquit
him
,
<EOS>
was
it
not
reasonable
that
she
under
similar
circumstances
should
expect
a
similar
acquittal
?
<EOS>
Then
she
declared
to
herself
that
she
carried
on
this
argument
within
her
own
breast
simply
as
an
argument
,
induced
to
do
so
by
that
assertion
on
his
part
that
he
was
already
her
husband
,
 
that
his
house
was
even
now
her
home
.
<EOS>
She
had
no
intention
of
using
that
power
which
was
still
hers
.
<EOS>
She
had
no
wish
to
go
back
from
her
pledged
word
.
<EOS>
She
thought
that
she
had
no
such
wish
.
<EOS>
She
loved
him
much
,
and
admired
him
even
more
than
she
loved
him
.
<EOS>
He
was
noble
,
generous
,
clever
,
good
,
 
so
good
as
to
be
almost
perfect
;
nay
,
for
aught
she
knew
he
was
perfect
.
<EOS>
Would
that
he
had
some
faults
!
<EOS>
Would
that
he
had
!
<EOS>
Would
that
he
had
!
<EOS>
How
could
she
,
full
of
faults
as
she
knew
herself
to
be
,
 
how
could
she
hope
to
make
happy
a
man
perfect
as
he
was
!
<EOS>
But
then
there
would
be
no
doubt
as
to
her
present
duty
.
<EOS>
She
loved
him
,
and
that
was
everything
.
<EOS>
Having
told
him
that
she
loved
him
,
and
having
on
that
score
accepted
his
love
,
nothing
but
a
change
in
her
heart
towards
him
could
justify
her
in
seeking
to
break
the
bond
which
bound
them
together
.
<EOS>
She
did
love
him
,
and
she
loved
him
only
.
  
<EOS>
But
she
had
once
loved
her
cousin
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
truly
it
was
so
.
<EOS>
In
her
thoughts
she
did
not
now
deny
it
.
<EOS>
She
had
loved
him
,
and
was
tormented
by
a
feeling
that
she
had
had
a
more
full
delight
in
that
love
than
in
this
other
that
had
sprung
up
subsequently
.
<EOS>
She
had
told
herself
that
this
had
come
of
her
youth
;
 
that
love
at
twenty
was
sweeter
than
it
could
be
afterwards
.
<EOS>
There
had
been
a
something
of
rapture
in
that
earlier
dream
which
could
never
be
repeated
,
 
which
could
never
live
,
indeed
,
except
in
a
dream
.
<EOS>
Now
,
now
that
she
was
older
and
perhaps
wiser
,
love
meant
a
partnership
,
in
which
each
partner
would
be
honest
to
the
other
,
in
which
each
would
wish
and
strive
for
the
other
's
welfare
,
so
that
thus
their
joint
welfare
might
be
insured
.
<EOS>
Then
,
in
those
early
girlish
days
,
it
had
meant
a
total
abnegation
of
self
.
<EOS>
The
one
was
of
earth
,
and
therefore
possible
.
<EOS>
The
other
had
been
a
ray
from
heaven
,
 
and
impossible
,
except
in
a
dream
.
  
<EOS>
And
she
had
been
mistaken
in
her
first
love
.
<EOS>
She
admitted
that
frankly
.
<EOS>
He
whom
she
had
worshipped
had
been
an
idol
of
clay
,
and
she
knew
that
it
was
well
for
her
to
have
abandoned
that
idolatry
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
only
been
untrue
to
her
,
but
,
worse
than
that
,
had
been
false
in
excusing
his
untruth
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
only
promised
falsely
,
but
had
made
such
promises
with
a
deliberate
,
premeditated
falsehood
.
<EOS>
And
he
had
been
selfish
,
coldly
selfish
,
weighing
the
value
of
his
own
low
lusts
against
that
of
her
holy
love
.
<EOS>
She
had
known
this
,
and
had
parted
from
him
with
an
oath
to
herself
that
no
promised
contrition
on
his
part
should
ever
bring
them
again
together
.
<EOS>
But
she
had
pardoned
him
as
a
man
,
though
never
as
a
lover
,
and
had
bade
him
welcome
again
as
a
cousin
and
as
her
friend
's
brother
.
<EOS>
She
had
again
become
very
anxious
as
to
his
career
,
not
hiding
her
regard
,
but
professing
that
anxiety
aloud
.
<EOS>
She
knew
him
to
be
clever
,
ambitious
,
bold
,
 
and
<EOS>
she
believed
even
yet
,
in
spite
of
her
own
experience
,
that
he
might
not
be
bad
at
heart
.
<EOS>
Now
,
as
she
told
herself
that
in
truth
she
loved
the
man
to
whom
her
troth
was
plighted
,
I
fear
that
she
almost
thought
more
of
that
other
man
from
whom
she
had
torn
herself
asunder
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
should
he
find
himself
unhappy
in
London
?
<EOS>
"
she
said
,
as
she
went
back
to
the
letter
.
<EOS>
"
Why
should
he
pretend
to
condemn
the
very
place
which
most
men
find
the
fittest
for
all
their
energies
?
<EOS>
Were
I
a
man
,
no
earthly
consideration
should
induce
me
to
live
elsewhere
.
<EOS>
It
is
odd
how
we
differ
in
all
things
.
<EOS>
However
brilliant
might
be
his
own
light
,
he
would
be
contented
to
hide
it
under
a
bushel
!
"
  
<EOS>
And
at
last
she
recurred
to
that
matter
as
to
which
she
had
been
so
anxious
when
she
first
opened
her
lover
's
letter
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
remembered
how
assured
she
had
expressed
herself
that
Mr.
Grey
would
not
condescend
to
object
to
her
travelling
with
her
cousin
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
so
condescended
.
<EOS>
He
had
written
on
the
matter
with
a
pleasant
joke
,
like
a
gentleman
as
he
was
,
disdaining
to
allude
to
the
past
passages
in
the
life
of
her
whom
he
loved
,
abstaining
even
from
expressing
anything
that
might
be
taken
as
a
permission
on
his
part
.
<EOS>
There
had
been
in
Alice
's
words
,
as
she
told
him
of
their
proposed
plan
,
a
something
that
had
betrayed
a
tremor
in
her
thoughts
.
<EOS>
She
had
studiously
striven
so
to
frame
her
phrases
that
her
tale
might
be
told
as
any
other
simple
statement
,
 
as
though
there
had
been
no
trembling
in
her
mind
as
she
wrote
.
<EOS>
But
she
had
failed
,
and
she
knew
that
she
had
failed
.
<EOS>
She
had
failed
;
and
he
had
read
all
her
effort
and
all
her
failure
.
<EOS>
She
was
quite
conscious
of
this
;
she
felt
it
thoroughly
;
and
she
knew
that
he
was
noble
and
a
gentleman
to
the
last
drop
of
his
blood
.
<EOS>
And
yet
 
yet
 
yet
there
was
almost
a
feeling
of
disappointment
in
that
he
had
not
written
such
a
letter
as
Lady
Macleod
had
anticipated
.
  
<EOS>
During
the
next
week
Lady
Macleod
still
came
almost
daily
to
Queen
Anne
Street
,
but
nothing
further
was
said
between
her
and
Miss
Vavasor
as
to
the
Swiss
tour
;
nor
were
any
questions
asked
about
Mr.
Grey
's
opinion
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
The
old
lady
of
course
discovered
that
there
was
no
quarrel
,
or
,
as
she
believed
,
any
probability
of
a
quarrel
;
and
with
that
she
was
obliged
to
be
contented
.
<EOS>
Nor
did
she
again
on
this
occasion
attempt
to
take
Alice
to
Lady
Midlothian
's
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
their
usual
subjects
of
conversation
were
almost
abandoned
,
and
Lady
Macleod
's
visits
,
though
they
were
as
constant
as
heretofore
,
were
not
so
long
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
dare
to
talk
about
Mr.
Grey
,
and
because
she
did
not
so
dare
,
was
determined
to
regard
herself
as
in
a
degree
ill
-
used
.
<EOS>
So
she
was
silent
,
reserved
,
and
fretful
.
<EOS>
At
length
came
the
last
day
of
her
London
season
,
and
her
last
visit
to
her
niece
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
come
because
it
's
my
last
day
,
"
said
Lady
Macleod
;
"
but
really
I
'm
so
hurried
,
and
have
so
many
things
to
do
,
that
I
hardly
know
how
to
manage
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
very
kind
,
"
said
Alice
,
giving
her
aunt
an
affectionate
squeeze
of
the
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
keeping
the
cab
,
so
I
can
just
stay
twenty
-
five
minutes
.
<EOS>
I
've
marked
the
time
accurately
,
but
I
know
the
man
will
swear
it
's
over
the
half
-
hour
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
'll
have
no
more
trouble
about
cabs
,
aunt
,
when
you
are
back
in
Cheltenham
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
flies
are
worse
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
I
really
think
they
're
worse
.
<EOS>
I
pay
the
bill
every
month
,
but
they
've
always
one
down
that
I
did
n't
have
.
<EOS>
It
's
the
regular
practice
,
for
I
've
had
them
from
all
the
men
in
the
place
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
hard
enough
to
find
honest
men
anywhere
,
I
suppose
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Or
honest
women
either
.
<EOS>
What
do
you
think
of
Mrs.
Green
wanting
to
charge
me
for
an
extra
week
,
because
she
says
I
did
n't
give
her
notice
till
Tuesday
morning
?
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
pay
her
,
and
she
may
stop
my
things
if
she
dares
.
<EOS>
However
,
it
's
the
last
time
.
<EOS>
I
shall
never
come
up
to
London
again
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
aunt
,
do
n't
say
that
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
do
say
it
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
What
should
an
old
woman
like
me
do
,
trailing
up
to
town
every
year
,
merely
because
it
's
what
people
choose
to
call
the
season
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
To
see
your
friends
,
of
course
.
<EOS>
Age
does
n't
matter
when
a
person
's
health
is
so
good
as
yours
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
knew
what
I
suffer
from
lumbago
,
 
though
I
must
say
coming
to
London
always
does
cure
that
for
the
time
.
<EOS>
But
as
for
friends
 
!
<EOS>
Well
,
I
suppose
one
has
no
right
to
complain
when
one
gets
to
be
as
old
as
I
am
;
but
I
declare
I
believe
that
those
I
love
best
would
sooner
be
without
me
than
with
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
mean
me
,
aunt
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
my
dear
,
I
do
n't
mean
you
.
<EOS>
Of
course
my
life
would
have
been
very
different
if
you
could
have
consented
to
remain
with
me
till
you
were
married
.
<EOS>
But
I
did
n't
mean
you
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
that
I
meant
any
one
.
<EOS>
You
should
n't
mind
what
an
old
woman
like
me
says
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
You
're
a
little
melancholy
because
you
're
going
away
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
why
I
stayed
the
last
week
.
<EOS>
I
did
say
to
Lady
Midlothian
that
I
thought
I
should
go
on
the
20th
;
and
,
though
I
know
that
she
knew
that
I
really
did
n't
go
,
she
has
not
once
sent
to
me
since
.
<EOS>
To
be
sure
they
've
been
out
every
night
;
but
I
thought
she
might
have
asked
me
to
come
and
lunch
.
<EOS>
It
's
so
very
lonely
dining
by
myself
in
lodgings
in
London
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
yet
you
never
will
come
and
dine
with
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
my
dear
;
no
.
<EOS>
But
we
wo
n't
talk
about
that
.
<EOS>
I
've
just
one
word
more
to
say
.
<EOS>
Let
me
see
.
<EOS>
I
've
just
six
minutes
to
stay
.
<EOS>
I
've
made
up
my
mind
that
I
'll
never
come
up
to
town
again
,
 
except
for
one
thing
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
what
's
that
,
aunt
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Alice
,
as
she
asked
the
question
,
well
knew
what
that
one
thing
was
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
come
for
your
marriage
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
I
do
hope
you
will
not
keep
me
long
waiting
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
make
any
promise
.
<EOS>
There
's
no
knowing
when
that
may
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
why
should
there
be
no
knowing
?
<EOS>
I
always
think
that
when
a
girl
is
once
engaged
the
sooner
<EOS>
she
's
married
the
better
.
<EOS>
There
may
be
reasons
for
delay
on
the
gentleman
's
part
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
very
often
are
,
you
know
,
"
  
"
But
,
Alice
,
you
do
n't
mean
to
say
that
Mr.
Grey
is
putting
it
off
?
"
  
<EOS>
Alice
was
silent
for
a
moment
,
during
which
Lady
Macleod
's
face
assumed
a
look
of
almost
tragic
horror
.
<EOS>
Was
there
something
wrong
on
Mr.
Grey
's
side
of
which
she
was
altogether
unaware
?
<EOS>
Alice
,
though
for
a
second
or
two
she
had
been
guilty
of
a
slight
playful
deceit
,
was
too
honest
to
allow
the
impression
to
remain
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
aunt
,
"
she
said
;
"
Mr.
Grey
is
not
putting
it
off
.
<EOS>
It
has
been
left
to
me
to
fix
the
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
why
do
n't
you
fix
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
such
a
serious
thing
!
<EOS>
After
all
it
is
not
more
than
four
months
yet
since
I
 
I
accepted
him
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
that
there
has
been
any
delay
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
might
fix
the
time
now
,
if
he
wishes
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
perhaps
I
shall
,
 
some
day
,
aunt
.
<EOS>
I
'm
going
to
think
about
it
,
and
you
must
n't
drive
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
should
have
some
one
to
advise
you
,
Alice
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
that
's
just
it
.
<EOS>
People
always
do
seem
to
think
it
so
terrible
that
a
girl
should
have
her
own
way
in
anything
.
<EOS>
She
must
n't
like
any
one
at
first
;
and
then
,
when
she
does
like
some
one
,
she
must
marry
him
directly
<EOS>
she
's
bidden
.
<EOS>
I
have
n't
much
of
my
own
way
at
present
;
but
you
see
,
when
I
'm
married
I
sha
n't
have
it
at
all
.
<EOS>
You
ca
n't
wonder
that
I
should
n't
be
in
a
hurry
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
advocating
anything
like
hurry
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
But
,
goodness
gracious
me
!
<EOS>
I
've
been
here
twenty
-
eight
minutes
,
and
that
horrid
man
will
impose
upon
me
.
<EOS>
Good
-
bye
<EOS>
;
God
bless
you
!
<EOS>
Mind
you
write
.
"
<EOS>
And
Lady
Macleod
hurried
out
of
the
room
more
intent
at
the
present
moment
upon
saving
her
sixpence
than
she
was
on
any
other
matter
whatsoever
.
  
<EOS>
And
then
John
Grey
came
up
to
town
,
arriving
a
day
or
two
after
the
time
that
he
had
fixed
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
,
perhaps
,
improbable
that
Alice
had
used
some
diplomatic
skill
in
preventing
a
meeting
between
Lady
Macleod
and
her
lover
.
<EOS>
They
both
were
very
anxious
to
obtain
the
same
object
,
and
Alice
was
to
some
extent
opposed
to
their
views
.
<EOS>
Had
Lady
Macleod
and
John
Grey
put
their
forces
together
<EOS>
she
might
have
found
herself
unable
to
resist
their
joint
endeavours
.
<EOS>
She
was
resolved
that
she
would
not
at
any
rate
name
any
day
for
her
marriage
before
her
return
from
Switzerland
;
and
she
may
therefore
have
thought
it
wise
to
keep
Mr.
Grey
in
the
country
till
after
Lady
Macleod
had
gone
,
even
though
she
thereby
cut
down
the
time
of
his
sojourn
in
London
to
four
days
.
<EOS>
On
the
occasion
of
that
visit
Mr.
Vavasor
did
a
very
memorable
thing
.
<EOS>
He
dined
at
home
with
the
view
of
welcoming
his
future
son
-
in
-
law
.
<EOS>
He
dined
at
home
,
and
asked
,
or
rather
assented
to
Alice
's
asking
,
George
and
Kate
Vavasor
to
join
the
dinner
-
party
.
<EOS>
"
What
an
auspicious
omen
for
the
future
nuptials
!
"
said
Kate
,
with
her
little
sarcastic
smile
.
"
<EOS>
Uncle
John
dines
at
home
,
and
Mr.
Grey
joins
in
the
dissipation
of
a
dinner
-
party
.
<EOS>
We
shall
all
be
changed
soon
,
I
suppose
,
and
George
and
I
will
take
to
keeping
a
little
cottage
in
the
country
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Kate
,
"
said
Alice
,
angrily
,
"
I
think
you
are
about
the
most
unjust
person
I
ever
met
.
<EOS>
I
would
forgive
your
raillery
,
however
painful
it
might
be
,
if
it
were
only
fair
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
to
whom
is
it
unfair
on
the
present
occasion
;
 
to
your
father
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
not
intended
for
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
To
yourself
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
care
nothing
as
to
myself
;
you
know
that
very
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
it
must
have
been
unfair
to
Mr.
Grey
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Yes
;
it
was
Mr.
Grey
whom
you
meant
to
attack
.
<EOS>
If
I
can
forgive
him
for
not
caring
for
society
,
surely
you
might
do
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Exactly
;
<EOS>
but
that
's
just
what
you
ca
n't
do
,
<EOS>
my
dear
.
<EOS>
You
do
n't
forgive
him
.
<EOS>
If
you
did
you
might
be
quite
sure
that
I
should
say
nothing
.
<EOS>
And
if
you
choose
to
bid
me
hold
my
tongue
I
will
say
nothing
.
<EOS>
But
when
you
tell
me
all
your
own
thoughts
about
this
thing
you
can
hardly
expect
but
that
I
should
let
you
know
mine
in
return
.
<EOS>
I
'm
not
particular
;
and
if
you
are
ready
for
a
little
good
,
wholesome
,
useful
hypocrisy
,
I
wo
n't
balk
you
.
<EOS>
I
may
n't
be
quite
so
dishonest
as
you
call
me
,
but
I
'm
not
so
wedded
to
truth
<EOS>
but
what
I
can
look
,
and
act
,
and
speak
a
few
falsehoods
if
you
wish
it
.
<EOS>
Only
let
us
understand
each
other
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
I
wish
for
no
falsehood
,
Kate
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
it
's
very
hard
to
understand
what
you
do
wish
.
<EOS>
I
know
that
for
the
last
year
or
two
I
have
been
trying
to
find
out
your
wishes
,
and
,
upon
my
word
,
my
success
has
been
very
indifferent
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
you
wish
to
marry
Mr.
Grey
,
but
I
'm
by
no
means
certain
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
the
last
thing
on
earth
you
'd
wish
would
be
to
marry
George
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
very
last
.
<EOS>
You
're
right
there
at
any
rate
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Alice
 
!
<EOS>
sometimes
you
drive
me
too
hard
;
you
do
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
You
make
me
doubt
whether
I
hate
or
love
you
most
.
<EOS>
Knowing
what
my
feelings
are
about
George
,
I
can
not
understand
how
you
can
bring
yourself
to
speak
of
him
to
me
with
such
contempt
!
"
<EOS>
Kate
Vavasor
,
as
she
spoke
these
words
,
left
the
room
with
a
quick
step
,
and
hurried
up
to
her
own
chamber
.
<EOS>
There
Alice
found
her
in
tears
,
and
was
driven
by
her
friend
's
real
grief
into
the
expression
of
an
apology
,
which
she
knew
was
not
properly
due
from
her
.
<EOS>
Kate
was
acquainted
with
all
the
circumstances
of
that
old
affair
between
her
brother
and
Alice
.
<EOS>
She
had
given
in
her
adhesion
to
the
propriety
of
what
Alice
had
done
.
<EOS>
She
had
allowed
that
her
brother
George
's
behaviour
had
been
such
as
to
make
any
engagement
between
them
impossible
.
<EOS>
The
fault
,
therefore
,
had
been
hers
in
making
any
reference
to
the
question
of
such
a
marriage
.
<EOS>
Nor
had
it
been
by
any
means
her
first
fault
of
the
same
kind
.
<EOS>
Till
Alice
had
become
engaged
to
Mr.
Grey
<EOS>
she
had
spoken
of
George
only
as
her
brother
,
or
as
her
friend
's
cousin
,
but
now
she
was
constantly
making
allusion
to
those
past
occurrences
,
which
all
of
them
should
have
striven
to
forget
.
<EOS>
Under
these
circumstances
was
not
Lady
Macleod
right
in
saying
that
George
Vavasor
should
not
have
been
accepted
as
a
companion
for
the
Swiss
tour
?
  
<EOS>
The
little
dinner
-
party
went
off
very
quietly
;
and
if
no
other
ground
existed
for
charging
Mr.
Grey
with
London
dissipation
than
what
that
afforded
,
he
was
accused
most
unjustly
.
<EOS>
The
two
young
men
had
never
before
met
each
other
;
and
Vavasor
had
gone
to
his
uncle
's
house
,
prepared
not
only
to
dislike
but
to
despise
his
successor
in
Alice
's
favour
.
<EOS>
But
in
this
he
was
either
disappointed
or
gratified
,
as
the
case
may
be
.
"
<EOS>
He
has
plenty
to
say
for
himself
,
"
he
said
to
Kate
on
his
way
home
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
yes
;
he
can
talk
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
he
does
n't
talk
like
a
prig
either
,
which
was
what
I
expected
.
<EOS>
He
's
uncommonly
handsome
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
thought
men
never
saw
that
in
each
other
.
<EOS>
I
never
see
it
in
any
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
see
it
in
every
animal
 
in
men
,
women
,
horses
,
dogs
,
and
even
pigs
.
<EOS>
I
like
to
look
on
handsome
things
.
<EOS>
I
think
people
always
do
who
are
ugly
themselves
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
so
you
're
going
into
raptures
in
favour
of
John
Grey
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
'm
not
.
<EOS>
I
very
seldom
go
into
raptures
about
anything
.
<EOS>
But
he
talks
in
the
way
I
like
a
man
to
talk
.
<EOS>
How
he
bowled
my
uncle
over
about
those
actors
;
and
yet
if
my
uncle
knows
anything
about
anything
it
is
about
the
stage
twenty
years
ago
.
<EOS>
"
There
was
nothing
more
said
then
about
John
Grey
;
but
Kate
understood
her
brother
well
enough
to
be
aware
that
this
praise
meant
very
little
.
<EOS>
George
Vavasor
spoke
sometimes
from
his
heart
,
and
did
so
more
frequently
to
his
sister
than
to
any
one
else
;
but
his
words
came
generally
from
his
head
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
day
after
the
little
dinner
in
Queen
Anne
Street
,
John
Grey
came
to
say
good
-
bye
to
his
betrothed
;
 
for
his
betrothed
<EOS>
she
certainly
was
,
in
spite
of
those
very
poor
arguments
which
she
had
used
in
trying
to
convince
herself
that
she
was
still
free
if
she
wished
to
claim
her
freedom
.
<EOS>
Though
he
had
been
constantly
with
Alice
during
the
last
three
days
,
he
had
not
hitherto
said
anything
as
to
the
day
of
their
marriage
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
constantly
with
her
alone
,
sitting
for
hours
in
that
ugly
green
drawing
-
room
,
but
he
had
never
touched
the
subject
.
<EOS>
He
had
told
her
much
of
Switzerland
,
which
she
had
never
yet
seen
but
which
he
knew
well
.
<EOS>
He
had
told
her
much
of
his
garden
and
house
,
whither
<EOS>
she
had
once
gone
with
her
father
,
whilst
paying
a
visit
nominally
to
the
colleges
at
Cambridge
.
<EOS>
And
he
had
talked
of
various
matters
,
matters
bearing
in
no
immediate
way
upon
his
own
or
her
affairs
;
for
Mr.
Grey
was
a
man
who
knew
well
how
to
make
words
pleasant
;
but
previous
to
this
last
moment
he
had
said
nothing
on
that
subject
on
which
he
was
so
intent
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Alice
,
"
he
said
,
when
the
last
hour
had
come
,
"
and
about
that
question
of
home
affairs
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Let
us
finish
off
the
foreign
affairs
first
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
have
finished
them
;
have
n't
we
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Finished
them
!
<EOS>
why
we
have
n't
started
yet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
you
have
n't
started
.
<EOS>
But
we
've
had
the
discussion
.
<EOS>
Is
there
any
reason
why
you
'd
rather
not
have
this
thing
settled
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
no
special
reason
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
why
not
let
it
be
fixed
?
<EOS>
Do
you
fear
coming
to
me
as
my
wife
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
think
that
you
repent
your
goodness
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
I
do
n't
repent
it
;
 
what
you
call
my
goodness
?
<EOS>
I
love
you
too
entirely
for
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
My
darling
!
"
<EOS>
And
now
he
passed
his
arm
round
her
waist
as
they
stood
near
the
empty
fireplace
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
if
you
love
me
 
"
  
"
I
do
love
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
why
should
you
not
wish
to
come
to
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
wish
it
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
wish
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
Alice
,
you
must
have
wished
it
altogether
when
you
consented
to
be
my
wife
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
person
may
wish
for
a
thing
altogether
,
and
yet
not
wish
for
it
instantly
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Instantly
!
<EOS>
Come
;
I
have
not
been
hard
on
you
.
<EOS>
This
is
still
June
.
<EOS>
Will
you
say
the
middle
of
September
,
and
we
shall
still
be
in
time
for
warm
pleasant
days
among
the
lakes
?
<EOS>
Is
that
asking
for
too
much
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
asking
for
anything
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
but
it
is
,
love
.
<EOS>
Grant
it
,
and
I
will
swear
that
you
have
granted
me
everything
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
was
silent
,
having
things
to
say
but
not
knowing
in
what
words
to
put
them
.
<EOS>
Now
that
he
was
with
her
she
could
not
say
the
things
which
she
had
told
herself
that
she
would
utter
to
him
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
bring
herself
to
hint
to
him
that
his
views
of
life
were
so
unlike
her
own
,
that
there
could
be
no
chance
of
happiness
between
them
,
unless
each
could
strive
to
lean
somewhat
towards
the
other
.
<EOS>
No
man
could
be
more
gracious
in
word
and
manner
than
John
Grey
;
no
man
more
chivalrous
in
his
carriage
towards
a
woman
;
but
he
always
spoke
and
acted
as
though
there
could
be
no
question
that
his
manner
of
life
was
to
be
adopted
,
without
a
word
or
thought
of
doubting
,
by
his
wife
.
<EOS>
When
two
came
together
,
why
should
not
each
yield
something
,
and
each
claim
something
?
<EOS>
This
she
had
meant
to
say
to
him
on
this
day
;
but
now
that
he
was
with
her
she
could
not
say
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
John
,
"
she
said
at
last
,
"
do
not
press
me
about
this
till
I
return
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
then
you
will
say
the
time
is
short
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
short
then
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
answer
you
now
;
 
indeed
,
I
can
not
.
<EOS>
That
is
I
can
not
answer
in
the
affirmative
.
<EOS>
It
is
such
a
solemn
thing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Will
it
ever
be
less
solemn
,
dearest
?
"
  
"
Never
,
I
hope
never
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
did
not
press
her
further
then
,
but
kissed
her
and
bade
her
farewell
.
   
<EOS>
George
Vavasor
,
the
Wild
Man
.
 
<EOS>
It
will
no
doubt
be
understood
that
George
Vavasor
did
not
roam
about
in
the
woods
unshorn
,
or
wear
leathern
trappings
and
sandals
,
like
Robinson
Crusoe
,
instead
of
coats
and
trousers
.
<EOS>
His
wildness
was
of
another
kind
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
I
do
n't
know
that
he
was
in
truth
at
all
wild
,
though
Lady
Macleod
had
called
him
so
,
and
Alice
had
assented
to
her
use
of
the
word
.
  
<EOS>
George
Vavasor
had
lived
in
London
since
he
was
twenty
,
and
now
,
at
the
time
of
the
beginning
of
my
story
,
he
was
a
year
or
two
over
thirty
.
<EOS>
He
was
and
ever
had
been
the
heir
to
his
grandfather
's
estate
;
but
that
estate
was
small
,
and
when
George
first
came
to
London
his
father
was
a
strong
man
of
forty
,
with
as
much
promise
of
life
in
him
as
his
son
had
.
<EOS>
A
profession
had
therefore
been
absolutely
necessary
to
him
;
and
he
had
,
at
his
uncle
<EOS>
John
's
instance
,
been
placed
in
the
office
of
a
parliamentary
land
agent
.
<EOS>
With
this
parliamentary
land
agent
he
had
quarrelled
to
the
knife
,
but
not
before
he
had
by
his
talents
made
himself
so
useful
that
he
had
before
him
the
prospects
of
a
lucrative
partnership
in
the
business
.
<EOS>
George
Vavasor
had
many
faults
,
but
idleness
 
absolute
idleness
 
was
not
one
of
them
.
<EOS>
He
would
occasionally
postpone
his
work
to
pleasure
.
<EOS>
He
would
be
at
Newmarket
when
he
should
have
been
at
Whitehall
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
not
usual
with
him
to
be
in
bed
when
he
should
be
at
his
desk
,
and
when
he
was
at
his
desk
he
did
not
whittle
his
ruler
,
or
pick
his
teeth
,
or
clip
his
nails
.
<EOS>
Upon
the
whole
his
friends
were
pleased
with
the
first
five
years
of
his
life
in
London
 
in
spite
of
his
having
been
found
to
be
in
debt
on
more
than
one
occasion
.
<EOS>
But
his
debts
had
been
paid
;
and
all
was
going
on
swimmingly
,
when
one
day
he
knocked
down
the
parliamentary
agent
with
a
blow
between
the
eyes
,
and
then
there
was
an
end
of
that
.
<EOS>
He
himself
was
wo
nt
to
say
that
he
had
known
very
well
what
he
was
about
,
that
it
had
behoved
him
to
knock
down
the
man
who
was
to
have
been
his
partner
,
and
that
he
regretted
nothing
in
the
matter
.
<EOS>
At
any
rate
the
deed
was
looked
upon
with
approving
eyes
by
many
men
of
good
standing
,
 
or
,
at
any
rate
,
sufficient
standing
to
help
George
to
another
position
;
and
within
six
weeks
of
the
time
of
his
leaving
the
office
at
Whitehall
,
he
had
become
a
partner
in
an
established
firm
of
wine
merchants
.
<EOS>
A
great
-
aunt
had
just
then
left
him
a
couple
of
thousand
pounds
,
which
no
doubt
assisted
him
in
his
views
with
the
wine
merchants
.
  
<EOS>
In
this
employment
he
remained
for
another
period
of
five
years
,
and
was
supposed
by
all
his
friends
to
be
doing
very
well
.
<EOS>
And
indeed
he
did
not
do
badly
,
only
that
he
did
not
do
well
enough
to
satisfy
himself
.
<EOS>
He
was
ambitious
of
making
the
house
to
which
he
belonged
the
first
house
in
the
trade
in
London
,
and
scared
his
partners
by
the
boldness
and
extent
of
his
views
.
<EOS>
He
himself
declared
that
if
they
would
only
have
gone
along
with
him
he
would
have
made
them
princes
in
the
wine
market
.
<EOS>
But
they
were
men
either
of
more
prudence
or
of
less
audacity
than
he
,
and
they
declined
to
walk
in
his
courses
.
<EOS>
At
the
end
of
the
five
years
Vavasor
left
the
house
,
not
having
knocked
any
one
down
on
this
occasion
,
and
taking
with
him
a
very
nice
sum
of
money
.
  
<EOS>
The
two
last
of
these
five
years
had
certainly
been
the
best
period
of
his
life
,
for
he
had
really
worked
very
hard
,
like
a
man
,
giving
up
all
pleasure
that
took
time
from
him
,
 
and
giving
up
also
most
pleasures
which
were
dangerous
on
account
of
their
costliness
.
<EOS>
He
went
to
no
races
,
played
no
billiards
,
and
spoke
of
Cremorne
as
a
childish
thing
,
which
he
had
abandoned
now
that
he
was
no
longer
a
child
.
<EOS>
It
was
during
these
two
years
that
he
had
had
his
love
passages
with
his
cousin
;
and
it
must
be
presumed
that
he
had
,
at
any
rate
,
intended
at
one
time
to
settle
himself
respectably
as
a
married
man
.
<EOS>
He
had
,
however
,
behaved
very
badly
to
Alice
,
and
the
match
had
been
broken
off
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
also
during
the
last
two
years
quarrelled
with
his
grandfather
.
<EOS>
He
had
wished
to
raise
a
sum
of
money
on
the
Vavasor
estate
,
which
,
as
it
was
unentailed
,
he
could
only
do
with
his
grandfather
's
concurrence
.
<EOS>
The
old
gentleman
would
not
hear
of
it
,
 
would
listen
with
no
patience
to
the
proposition
.
<EOS>
It
was
in
vain
that
George
attempted
to
make
the
squire
understand
that
the
wine
business
was
going
on
very
well
,
that
he
himself
owed
no
man
anything
,
that
everything
with
him
was
flourishing
;
 
but
that
his
trade
might
be
extended
indefinitely
by
the
use
of
a
few
thousand
pounds
at
moderate
interest
.
<EOS>
Old
Mr.
Vavasor
was
furious
.
<EOS>
No
documents
and
no
assurances
could
make
him
lay
aside
a
belief
that
the
wine
merchants
,
and
the
business
,
and
his
grandson
were
all
ruined
and
ruinous
together
.
<EOS>
No
one
but
a
ruined
man
would
attempt
to
raise
money
on
the
family
estate
!
<EOS>
So
they
had
quarrelled
,
and
had
never
spoken
or
seen
each
other
since
.
"
<EOS>
He
shall
have
the
estate
for
his
life
,
"
the
squire
said
to
his
son
John
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
I
have
a
right
to
leave
it
away
from
him
.
<EOS>
It
never
has
been
left
away
from
the
heir
.
<EOS>
But
I
'll
tie
it
up
so
that
he
sha
n't
cut
a
tree
on
it
.
"
<EOS>
John
Vavasor
perhaps
thought
that
the
old
rule
of
primogeniture
might
under
such
circumstances
have
been
judiciously
abandoned
 
in
this
one
instance
,
in
his
own
favour
.
<EOS>
But
he
did
not
say
so
.
<EOS>
Nor
would
he
have
said
it
had
there
been
a
chance
of
his
doing
so
with
success
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
man
from
whom
no
very
noble
deed
could
be
expected
;
but
he
was
also
one
who
would
do
no
ignoble
deed
.
  
<EOS>
After
that
George
Vavasor
had
become
a
stockbroker
,
and
a
stockbroker
he
was
now
.
<EOS>
In
the
first
twelve
months
after
his
leaving
the
wine
business
,
 
the
same
being
the
first
year
after
his
breach
with
Alice
,
 
he
had
gone
back
greatly
in
the
estimation
of
men
.
<EOS>
He
had
lived
in
open
defiance
of
decency
.
<EOS>
He
had
spent
much
money
and
had
apparently
made
none
,
and
had
been
,
as
all
his
friends
declared
,
on
the
high
road
to
ruin
.
<EOS>
Aunt
Macleod
had
taken
her
judgement
from
this
period
of
his
life
when
she
had
spoken
of
him
as
a
man
who
never
did
anything
.
<EOS>
But
he
had
come
forth
again
suddenly
as
a
working
man
;
and
now
they
who
professed
to
know
,
declared
that
he
was
by
no
means
poor
.
<EOS>
He
was
in
the
City
every
day
;
and
during
the
last
two
years
had
earned
the
character
of
a
shrewd
fellow
who
knew
what
he
was
about
,
who
might
not
perhaps
be
very
mealy
-
mouthed
in
affairs
of
business
,
but
who
was
fairly
and
decently
honourable
in
his
money
transactions
.
<EOS>
In
fact
,
he
stood
well
on
"
Change
.
  
<EOS>
And
during
these
two
years
he
had
stood
a
contest
for
a
seat
in
Parliament
,
having
striven
to
represent
the
metropolitan
borough
of
Chelsea
,
on
the
extremely
Radical
interest
.
<EOS>
It
is
true
that
he
had
failed
,
and
that
he
had
spent
a
considerable
sum
of
money
in
the
contest
.
<EOS>
"
Where
on
earth
does
your
nephew
get
his
money
?
<EOS>
"
men
said
to
John
Vavasor
at
his
club
.
"
<EOS>
Upon
my
word
I
do
n't
know
,
"
said
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
"
He
does
n't
get
it
from
me
,
and
I
'm
sure
he
does
n't
get
it
from
my
father
.
"
<EOS>
But
George
Vavasor
,
though
he
failed
at
Chelsea
,
did
not
spend
his
money
altogether
fruitlessly
.
<EOS>
He
gained
reputation
by
the
struggle
,
and
men
came
to
speak
of
him
as
though
he
were
one
who
would
do
something
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
stockbroker
,
a
thorough
-
going
Radical
,
and
yet
he
was
the
heir
to
a
fine
estate
,
which
had
come
down
from
father
to
son
for
four
hundred
years
!
<EOS>
There
was
something
captivating
about
his
history
and
adventures
,
especially
as
just
at
the
time
of
the
election
he
became
engaged
to
an
heiress
,
who
died
a
month
before
the
marriage
should
have
taken
place
.
<EOS>
She
died
without
a
will
,
and
her
money
all
went
to
some
third
cousins
.
  
<EOS>
George
Vavasor
bore
this
last
disappointment
like
a
man
,
and
it
was
at
this
time
that
he
again
became
fully
reconciled
to
his
cousin
.
<EOS>
Previous
to
this
they
had
met
;
and
Alice
,
at
her
cousin
<EOS>
Kate
's
instigation
,
had
induced
her
father
to
meet
him
.
<EOS>
But
at
first
there
had
been
no
renewal
of
real
friendship
.
<EOS>
Alice
had
given
her
cordial
assent
to
her
cousin
's
marriage
with
the
heiress
,
Miss
Grant
,
telling
Kate
that
such
an
engagement
was
the
very
thing
to
put
him
thoroughly
on
his
feet
.
<EOS>
And
then
she
had
been
much
pleased
by
his
spirit
at
that
Chelsea
election
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
grand
of
him
,
was
n't
it
?
"
said
Kate
,
her
eyes
brimming
full
of
tears
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
very
spirited
,
"
said
Alice
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
knew
all
,
you
would
say
so
.
<EOS>
They
could
get
no
one
else
to
stand
but
that
Mr.
Travers
,
and
he
would
n't
come
forward
,
unless
they
would
guarantee
all
his
expenses
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
hope
it
did
n't
cost
George
much
,
"
said
Alice
.
<EOS>
"
It
did
,
though
;
nearly
all
he
had
got
.
<EOS>
But
what
matters
?
<EOS>
Money
's
nothing
to
him
,
except
for
its
uses
.
<EOS>
My
own
little
mite
is
my
own
now
,
and
he
shall
have
every
farthing
of
it
for
the
next
election
,
even
though
I
should
go
out
as
a
housemaid
the
next
day
.
<EOS>
"
There
must
have
been
something
great
about
George
Vavasor
,
or
he
would
not
have
been
so
idolized
by
such
a
girl
as
his
sister
Kate
.
  
<EOS>
Early
in
the
present
spring
,
before
the
arrangements
for
the
Swiss
journey
were
made
,
George
Vavasor
had
spoken
to
Alice
about
that
intended
marriage
which
had
been
broken
off
by
the
lady
's
death
.
<EOS>
He
was
sitting
one
evening
with
his
cousin
in
the
drawing
-
room
in
Queen
Anne
Street
,
waiting
for
Kate
,
who
was
to
join
him
there
before
going
to
some
party
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
whether
Kate
had
had
a
hint
from
her
brother
to
be
late
!
<EOS>
At
any
rate
,
the
two
were
together
for
an
hour
,
and
the
talk
had
been
all
about
himself
.
<EOS>
He
had
congratulated
her
on
her
engagement
with
Mr.
Grey
,
which
had
just
become
known
to
him
,
and
had
then
spoken
of
his
own
last
intended
marriage
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
grieved
for
her
,
"
he
said
,
"
greatly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
sure
you
did
,
George
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
did
;
 
for
her
,
herself
.
<EOS>
Of
course
the
world
has
given
me
credit
for
lamenting
the
loss
of
her
money
.
<EOS>
But
the
truth
is
,
that
as
regards
both
herself
and
her
money
,
it
is
much
better
for
me
that
we
were
never
married
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
mean
even
though
she
should
have
lived
?
"
  
"
Yes
;
 
even
had
she
lived
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
why
so
?
<EOS>
If
you
liked
her
,
her
money
was
surely
no
drawback
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
not
if
I
had
liked
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
did
you
not
like
her
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
George
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
not
love
her
as
a
man
should
love
his
wife
,
if
you
mean
that
.
<EOS>
As
for
my
liking
her
,
I
did
like
her
.
<EOS>
I
liked
her
very
much
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
would
have
loved
her
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
find
that
task
of
loving
so
very
easy
.
<EOS>
It
might
have
been
that
I
should
have
learned
to
hate
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
so
,
it
is
better
for
you
,
and
better
for
her
,
that
she
has
gone
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
better
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
of
it
.
<EOS>
And
yet
I
grieve
for
her
,
and
in
thinking
of
her
<EOS>
I
almost
feel
as
though
I
were
guilty
of
her
death
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
she
never
suspected
that
you
did
not
love
her
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
no
.
<EOS>
But
she
was
not
given
to
think
much
of
such
things
.
<EOS>
She
took
all
that
for
granted
.
<EOS>
Poor
girl
!
<EOS>
she
is
at
rest
now
,
and
her
money
has
gone
,
where
it
should
go
,
among
her
own
relatives
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
with
such
feelings
as
yours
are
about
her
,
her
money
would
have
been
a
burden
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
not
have
taken
it
.
<EOS>
I
hope
,
at
least
,
that
I
would
not
have
taken
it
.
<EOS>
Money
is
a
sore
temptation
,
especially
to
a
poor
man
like
me
.
<EOS>
It
is
well
for
me
that
the
trial
did
not
come
in
my
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
are
not
such
a
very
poor
man
now
,
are
you
,
George
?
<EOS>
I
thought
your
business
was
a
good
one
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
,
and
I
have
no
right
to
be
a
poor
man
.
<EOS>
But
a
man
will
be
poor
who
does
such
mad
things
as
I
do
.
<EOS>
I
had
three
or
four
thousand
pounds
clear
,
and
I
spent
every
shilling
of
it
on
the
Chelsea
election
.
<EOS>
Goodness
knows
whether
I
shall
have
a
shilling
at
all
when
another
chance
comes
round
;
but
if
I
have
I
shall
certainly
spend
it
,
and
if
I
have
not
,
I
shall
go
in
debt
wherever
I
can
raise
a
hundred
pounds
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
will
be
successful
at
last
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
feel
sure
that
I
shall
.
<EOS>
But
,
in
the
mean
time
,
I
can
not
but
know
that
my
career
is
perfectly
reckless
.
<EOS>
No
woman
ought
to
join
her
lot
to
mine
unless
she
has
within
her
courage
to
be
as
reckless
as
I
am
.
<EOS>
You
know
what
men
do
when
they
toss
up
for
shillings
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
suppose
I
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
tossing
up
every
day
of
my
life
for
every
shilling
that
I
have
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
you
mean
that
you
're
 
gambling
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
No
.
<EOS>
I
have
given
that
up
altogether
.
<EOS>
I
used
to
gamble
,
but
I
never
do
that
now
,
and
never
shall
again
.
<EOS>
What
I
mean
is
this
,
 
that
I
hold
myself
in
readiness
to
risk
everything
at
any
moment
,
in
order
to
gain
any
object
that
may
serve
my
turn
.
<EOS>
I
am
always
ready
to
lead
a
forlorn
hope
.
<EOS>
That
's
what
I
mean
by
tossing
up
every
day
for
every
shilling
that
I
have
.

<EOS>
Alice
did
not
quite
understand
him
,
and
perhaps
he
did
not
intend
that
she
should
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
his
object
was
to
mystify
her
imagination
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
understand
him
,
but
I
fear
that
she
admired
the
kind
of
courage
which
he
professed
.
<EOS>
And
he
had
not
only
professed
it
:
in
that
matter
of
the
past
election
he
had
certainly
practised
it
.
  
<EOS>
In
talking
of
beauty
to
his
sister
he
had
spoken
of
himself
as
being
ugly
.
<EOS>
He
would
not
generally
have
been
called
ugly
by
women
,
had
not
one
side
of
his
face
been
dreadfully
scarred
by
a
cicatrice
,
which
in
healing
,
had
left
a
dark
indented
line
down
from
his
left
eye
to
his
lower
jaw
.
<EOS>
That
black
ravine
running
through
his
cheek
was
certainly
ugly
.
<EOS>
On
some
occasions
,
when
he
was
angry
or
disappointed
,
it
was
very
hideous
;
for
he
would
so
contort
his
face
that
the
scar
would
,
as
it
were
,
stretch
itself
out
,
revealing
all
its
horrors
,
and
his
countenance
would
become
all
scar
.
"
<EOS>
He
looked
at
me
like
the
devil
himself
 
making
the
hole
in
his
face
gape
at
me
,
"
the
old
squire
had
said
to
John
Vavasor
in
describing
the
interview
in
which
the
grandson
had
tried
to
bully
his
grandfather
into
assenting
to
his
own
views
about
the
mortgage
.
<EOS>
But
in
other
respects
George
's
face
was
not
ugly
,
and
might
have
been
thought
handsome
by
many
women
.
<EOS>
His
hair
was
black
,
and
was
parted
in
the
front
.
<EOS>
His
forehead
,
though
low
,
was
broad
.
<EOS>
His
eyes
were
dark
and
bright
,
and
his
eyebrows
were
very
full
,
and
perfectly
black
.
<EOS>
At
those
periods
of
his
anger
,
all
his
face
which
was
not
scar
,
was
eye
and
eyebrow
.
<EOS>
He
wore
a
thick
black
moustache
,
which
covered
his
mouth
,
but
no
whiskers
.
<EOS>
People
said
of
him
that
he
was
so
proud
of
his
wound
that
he
would
not
grow
a
hair
to
cover
it
.
<EOS>
The
fact
,
however
,
was
that
no
whisker
could
be
made
to
come
sufficiently
forward
to
be
of
service
,
and
therefore
he
wore
none
.
  
<EOS>
The
story
of
that
wound
should
be
told
.
<EOS>
When
he
was
yet
hardly
more
than
a
boy
,
before
he
had
come
up
to
London
,
he
was
living
in
a
house
in
the
country
which
his
father
then
occupied
.
<EOS>
At
the
time
his
father
was
absent
,
and
he
and
his
sister
only
were
in
the
house
with
the
maid
-
servants
.
<EOS>
His
sister
had
a
few
jewels
in
her
room
,
and
an
exaggerated
report
of
them
having
come
to
the
ears
of
certain
enterprising
burglars
,
a
little
plan
was
arranged
for
obtaining
them
.
<EOS>
A
small
boy
was
hidden
in
the
house
,
a
window
was
opened
,
and
at
the
proper
witching
hour
of
night
a
stout
individual
crept
up
-
stairs
in
his
stocking
-
feet
,
and
was
already
at
Kate
Vavasor
's
door
,
 
<EOS>
when
,
in
the
dark
,
dressed
only
in
his
nightshirt
,
wholly
unarmed
,
George
Vavasor
flew
at
the
fellow
's
throat
.
<EOS>
Two
hours
elapsed
before
the
horror
-
stricken
women
of
the
house
could
bring
men
to
the
place
.
<EOS>
George
's
face
had
then
been
ripped
open
from
the
eye
downwards
,
with
some
chisel
,
or
house
-
breaking
instrument
.
<EOS>
But
the
man
was
dead
.
<EOS>
George
had
wrenched
from
him
his
own
tool
,
and
having
first
jabbed
him
all
over
with
insufficient
wounds
,
had
at
last
driven
the
steel
through
his
windpipe
.
<EOS>
The
small
boy
escaped
,
carrying
with
him
two
shillings
and
threepence
which
Kate
had
left
upon
the
drawing
-
room
mantelpiece
.
  
<EOS>
George
Vavasor
was
rather
low
in
stature
,
but
well
made
,
with
small
hands
and
feet
,
but
broad
in
the
chest
and
strong
in
the
loins
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
fine
horseman
and
a
hard
rider
;
and
men
who
had
known
him
well
said
that
he
could
fence
and
shoot
with
a
pistol
as
few
men
care
to
do
in
these
peaceable
days
.
<EOS>
Since
volunteering
had
come
up
,
he
had
become
a
captain
of
Volunteers
,
and
had
won
prizes
with
his
rifle
at
Wimbledon
.
  
<EOS>
Such
had
been
the
life
of
George
Vavasor
,
and
such
was
his
character
,
and
such
his
appearance
.
<EOS>
He
had
always
lived
alone
in
London
,
and
did
so
at
present
;
but
just
now
his
sister
was
much
with
him
,
as
she
was
staying
up
in
town
with
an
aunt
,
another
Vavasor
by
birth
,
with
whom
the
reader
will
,
if
he
persevere
,
become
acquainted
in
course
of
time
.
<EOS>
I
hope
he
will
persevere
a
little
,
for
of
all
the
Vavasors
<EOS>
Mrs.
Greenow
was
perhaps
the
best
worth
knowing
.
<EOS>
But
Kate
Vavasor
's
home
was
understood
to
be
in
her
grandfather
's
house
in
Westmoreland
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
evening
before
they
started
for
Switzerland
,
George
and
Kate
walked
from
Queen
Anne
Street
,
where
they
had
been
dining
with
Alice
,
to
Mrs.
Greenow
's
house
.
<EOS>
Everything
had
been
settled
about
luggage
,
hours
of
starting
,
and
routes
as
regarded
their
few
first
days
;
and
the
common
purse
had
been
made
over
to
George
.
<EOS>
That
portion
of
Mr.
Grey
's
letter
had
been
read
which
alluded
to
the
Paynims
and
the
glasses
of
water
,
and
everything
had
passed
in
the
best
of
good
-
humour
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
endeavour
to
get
the
cold
water
for
you
,
"
George
had
said
;
"
but
as
to
the
breakfasts
,
I
can
only
hope
you
wo
n't
put
me
to
severe
trials
by
any
very
early
hours
.
<EOS>
When
people
go
out
for
pleasure
it
should
be
pleasure
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
brother
and
sister
walked
through
two
or
three
streets
in
silence
,
and
then
Kate
asked
a
question
.
  
<EOS>
"
George
,
I
wonder
what
your
wishes
really
are
about
Alice
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
she
should
n't
want
her
breakfast
too
early
while
we
are
away
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
means
that
I
'm
to
hold
my
tongue
,
of
course
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
it
does
n't
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
it
means
that
you
intend
to
hold
yours
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
not
that
either
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
what
does
it
mean
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
I
have
no
fixed
wishes
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
Of
course
she
'll
marry
this
man
John
Grey
,
and
then
no
one
will
hear
another
word
about
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
will
no
doubt
,
if
you
do
n't
interfere
.
<EOS>
Probably
she
will
whether
you
interfere
or
not
.
<EOS>
But
if
you
wish
to
interfere
 
"
  
"
She
's
got
four
hundred
a
year
,
and
is
not
so
good
-
looking
as
she
was
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
she
has
got
four
hundred
a
year
,
and
she
is
more
handsome
now
than
ever
she
was
.
<EOS>
I
know
that
you
think
so
;
 
and
that
you
love
her
and
love
no
one
else
 
unless
you
have
a
sneaking
fondness
for
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
leave
you
to
judge
of
that
last
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
as
for
me
,
 
I
only
love
two
people
in
the
world
;
her
and
you
.
<EOS>
If
ever
you
mean
to
try
,
you
should
try
now
.

Swiss
tour

"
<EOS>
Six
Weeks
in
the
Bernese
Oberland
,
by
party
of
three
,
"
would
have
but
very
small
chance
of
success
in
the
literary
world
at
present
,
and
I
should
consider
myself
to
be
dishonest
if
I
attempt
to
palm
off
such
matter
on
the
public
in
the
pages
of
a
novel

It
is
true
that
I
have
just
returned
from
Switzerland
,
and
should
find
such
a
course
of
writing
very
convenient

But
I
dismiss
the
temptation

strong
as
it
is

No

any
longer
wants
to

told
anything
of

or
of

<EOS>
Ludgate
Hill
is
now
-
a
-
days
more
interesting
than
the
Jungfrau
.
  
<EOS>
The
Vavasors
were
not
very
energetic
on
their
tour
.
<EOS>
As
George
had
said
,
they
had
gone
out
for
pleasure
and
not
for
work
.
<EOS>
They
went
direct
to
Interlaken
and
then
hung
about
between
that
place
and
Grindelwald
and
Lauterbrunnen
,
It
delighted
him
to
sit
still
on
some
outer
bench
,
looking
at
the
mountains
,
with
a
cigar
in
his
mouth
,
and
it
seemed
to
delight
them
to
be
with
him
.
<EOS>
Much
that
Mr.
Grey
prophesied
had
come
true
.
<EOS>
The
two
girls
were
ministers
to
him
,
instead
of
having
him
as
their
slave
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
fine
fellows
those
Alpine
club
men
think
themselves
,
"
he
said
on
one
of
these
occasions
,
"
and
how
thoroughly
they
despise
the
sort
of
enjoyment
I
get
from
mountains
.
<EOS>
But
they
're
mistaken
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
see
why
either
need
be
mistaken
,
"
said
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
they
are
mistaken
,
"
he
continued
.
<EOS>
"
They
rob
the
mountains
of
their
poetry
,
which
is
or
should
be
their
greatest
charm
.
<EOS>
Mont
Blanc
can
have
no
mystery
for
a
man
who
has
been
up
it
half
a
dozen
times
.
<EOS>
It
's
like
getting
behind
the
scenes
at
a
ballet
,
or
making
a
conjuror
explain
his
tricks
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
is
the
exercise
nothing
?
"
said
Kate
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
the
exercise
is
very
fine
;
 
but
that
avoids
the
question
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
they
all
botanize
,
"
said
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
believe
it
.
<EOS>
I
believe
that
the
most
of
them
simply
walk
up
the
mountain
and
down
again
.
<EOS>
But
if
they
did
,
that
avoids
the
question
also
.
<EOS>
The
poetry
and
mystery
of
the
mountains
are
lost
to
those
who
make
themselves
familiar
with
their
details
,
not
the
less
because
such
familiarity
may
have
useful
results
.
<EOS>
In
this
world
things
are
beautiful
only
because
they
are
not
quite
seen
,
or
not
perfectly
understood
.
<EOS>
Poetry
is
precious
chiefly
because
it
suggests
more
than
it
declares
.
<EOS>
Look
in
there
,
through
that
valley
,
where
you
just
see
the
distant
little
peak
at
the
end
.
<EOS>
Are
you
not
dreaming
of
the
unknown
beautiful
world
that
exists
up
there
;
 
beautiful
,
as
heaven
is
beautiful
,
because
you
know
nothing
of
the
reality
?
<EOS>
If
you
make
your
way
up
there
and
back
to
-
morrow
,
and
find
out
all
about
it
,
do
you
mean
to
say
that
it
will
be
as
beautiful
to
you
when
you
come
back
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
 
I
think
it
would
,
"
said
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
you
've
no
poetry
in
you
.
<EOS>
Now
I
'm
made
up
of
poetry
.
<EOS>
"
After
that
they
began
to
laugh
at
him
and
were
very
happy
.
  
<EOS>
I
think
that
Mr.
Grey
was
right
in
answering
Alice
's
letter
as
he
did
;
but
I
think
that
Lady
Macleod
was
also
right
in
saying
that
Alice
should
not
have
gone
to
Switzerland
in
company
with
George
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
A
peculiar
familiarity
sprang
up
,
which
,
had
all
its
circumstances
been
known
to
Mr.
Grey
,
would
not
have
entirely
satisfied
him
,
even
though
no
word
was
said
which
might
in
itself
have
displeased
him
.
<EOS>
During
the
first
weeks
of
their
travelling
<EOS>
no
word
was
said
which
would
have
displeased
him
;
but
at
last
,
when
the
time
for
their
return
was
drawing
nigh
,
when
their
happiness
was
nearly
over
,
and
that
feeling
of
melancholy
was
coming
on
them
which
always
pervades
the
last
hours
of
any
period
that
has
been
pleasant
,
 
then
words
became
softer
than
they
had
been
,
and
references
were
made
to
old
days
,
 
allusions
which
never
should
have
been
permitted
between
them
.
  
<EOS>
Alice
had
been
very
happy
,
 
more
happy
perhaps
in
that
she
had
been
a
joint
minister
with
Kate
to
her
cousin
George
's
idle
fantasies
,
than
she
would
have
been
hurrying
about
with
him
as
her
slave
.
<EOS>
They
had
tacitly
agreed
to
spoil
him
with
comforts
;
and
girls
are
always
happier
in
spoiling
some
man
than
in
being
spoiled
by
men
.
<EOS>
And
he
had
taken
it
all
well
,
doing
his
despotism
pleasantly
,
exacting
much
,
but
exacting
nothing
that
was
disagreeable
.
<EOS>
And
he
had
been
amusing
always
,
as
Alice
thought
without
any
effort
.
<EOS>
But
men
and
women
,
when
they
show
themselves
at
their
best
,
seldom
do
so
without
an
effort
.
<EOS>
If
the
object
be
near
the
heart
the
effort
will
be
pleasant
to
him
who
makes
it
,
and
if
it
be
made
well
,
it
will
be
hidden
;
but
,
not
the
less
,
will
the
effort
be
there
.
<EOS>
George
Vavasor
had
on
the
present
occasion
done
his
very
best
to
please
his
cousin
.
  
<EOS>
They
were
sitting
at
Basle
one
evening
in
the
balcony
of
the
big
hotel
which
overlooks
the
Rhine
.
<EOS>
The
balcony
runs
the
length
of
the
house
,
and
is
open
to
all
the
company
;
but
it
is
spacious
,
and
little
parties
can
be
formed
there
with
perfect
privacy
.
<EOS>
The
swift
broad
Rhine
runs
underneath
,
rushing
through
from
the
bridge
which
here
spans
the
river
;
and
every
now
and
then
on
summer
evenings
<EOS>
loud
shouts
come
up
from
strong
swimmers
in
the
water
,
who
are
glorying
in
the
swiftness
of
the
current
.
<EOS>
The
three
were
sitting
there
,
by
themselves
,
at
the
end
of
the
balcony
.
<EOS>
Coffee
was
before
them
on
a
little
table
,
and
George
's
cigar
,
as
usual
,
was
in
his
mouth
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
nearly
all
over
,
"
said
he
,
after
they
had
remained
silent
for
some
minutes
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
do
think
it
has
been
a
success
,
"
said
Kate
.
<EOS>
"
Always
excepting
about
the
money
.
<EOS>
I
'm
ruined
for
ever
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
make
your
money
all
straight
,
"
said
George
.
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
you
'll
do
nothing
of
the
kind
,
"
said
Kate
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
ruined
,
but
you
are
ruineder
.
<EOS>
But
what
signifies
?
<EOS>
It
is
such
a
great
thing
ever
to
have
had
six
weeks
"
happiness
,
that
the
ruin
is
,
in
point
of
fact
,
a
good
speculation
.
<EOS>
What
do
you
say
,
Alice
?
<EOS>
Wo
n't
you
vote
,
too
,
that
we
've
done
it
well
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
we
've
done
it
very
well
.
<EOS>
I
have
enjoyed
myself
thoroughly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
now
you
've
got
to
go
home
to
John
Grey
and
Cambridgeshire
!
<EOS>
It
's
no
wonder
you
should
be
melancholy
.
<EOS>
"
That
was
the
thought
in
Kate
's
mind
,
but
she
did
not
speak
it
out
on
this
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
good
of
you
,
Alice
,
"
said
Kate
.
<EOS>
"
Is
it
not
,
George
?
<EOS>
I
like
a
person
who
will
give
a
hearty
meed
of
approbation
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
am
giving
the
meed
of
approbation
to
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
like
a
person
even
to
do
that
heartily
,
"
said
Kate
.
<EOS>
"
Not
that
George
and
I
are
thankful
for
the
compliment
.
<EOS>
We
are
prepared
to
admit
that
we
owe
almost
everything
to
you
,
 
are
we
not
,
George
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
not
;
by
any
means
,
"
said
George
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
am
,
and
I
expect
to
have
something
pretty
said
to
me
in
return
.
<EOS>
Have
I
been
cross
once
,
Alice
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
I
do
n't
think
you
have
.
<EOS>
You
are
never
cross
,
though
you
are
often
ferocious
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
have
n't
been
once
ferocious
,
 
nor
has
George
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
would
have
been
the
most
ungrateful
man
alive
if
he
had
,
"
said
Alice
.
<EOS>
"
We
've
done
nothing
since
we
've
started
but
realize
from
him
that
picture
in
"
Punch
"
of
the
young
gentleman
at
Jeddo
who
had
a
dozen
ladies
to
wait
upon
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
now
he
has
got
to
go
home
to
his
lodgings
,
and
wait
upon
himself
again
.
<EOS>
Poor
fellow
!
<EOS>
I
do
pity
you
,
George
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
you
do
n't
;
 
nor
does
Alice
.
<EOS>
I
believe
girls
always
think
that
a
bachelor
in
London
has
the
happiest
of
all
lives
.
<EOS>
It
's
because
they
think
so
that
they
generally
want
to
put
an
end
to
the
man
's
condition
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
envy
that
makes
us
want
to
get
married
,
 
not
love
,
"
said
Kate
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
the
devil
in
some
shape
,
as
often
as
not
,
"
said
he
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
With
a
man
,
marriage
always
seems
to
him
to
be
an
evil
at
the
instant
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Not
always
,
"
said
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
Almost
always
;
 
but
he
does
it
,
as
he
takes
physic
,
because
something
worse
will
come
if
he
do
n't
.
<EOS>
A
man
never
likes
having
his
tooth
pulled
out
,
but
all
men
do
have
their
teeth
pulled
out
,
 
and
they
who
delay
it
too
long
suffer
the
very
mischief
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
like
George
's
philosophy
,
"
said
Kate
,
getting
up
from
her
chair
as
she
spoke
;
"
it
is
so
sharp
,
and
has
such
a
pleasant
acid
taste
about
it
;
and
then
we
all
know
that
it
means
nothing
.
<EOS>
Alice
,
I
'm
going
up
-
stairs
to
begin
the
final
packing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
come
with
you
,
dear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
do
n't
.
<EOS>
To
tell
the
truth
I
'm
only
going
into
that
man
's
room
because
he
wo
n't
put
up
a
single
thing
of
his
own
decently
.
<EOS>
We
'll
do
ours
,
of
course
,
when
we
go
up
to
bed
.
<EOS>
Whatever
you
disarrange
to
-
night
,
Master
George
,
you
must
rearrange
for
yourself
to
-
morrow
morning
,
for
I
promise
I
wo
n't
go
into
your
room
at
five
o'clock
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
I
do
hate
that
early
work
,
"
said
George
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
be
down
again
very
soon
,
"
said
Kate
.
<EOS>
"
Then
we
'll
take
one
turn
on
the
bridge
and
go
to
bed
.
"
  
<EOS>
Alice
and
George
were
left
together
sitting
in
the
balcony
.
<EOS>
They
had
been
alone
together
before
many
times
since
their
travels
had
commenced
;
but
they
both
of
them
felt
that
there
was
something
to
them
in
the
present
moment
different
from
any
other
period
of
their
journey
.
<EOS>
There
was
something
that
each
felt
to
be
sweet
,
undefinable
,
and
dangerous
.
<EOS>
Alice
had
known
that
it
would
be
better
for
her
to
go
up
-
stairs
with
Kate
;
but
Kate
's
answer
had
been
of
such
a
nature
that
had
she
gone
she
would
have
shown
that
she
had
some
special
reason
for
going
.
<EOS>
Why
should
she
show
such
a
need
?
<EOS>
Or
why
,
indeed
,
should
she
entertain
it
?
  
<EOS>
Alice
was
seated
quite
at
the
end
of
the
gallery
,
and
Kate
's
chair
was
at
her
feet
in
the
corner
.
<EOS>
When
Alice
and
Kate
had
seated
themselves
,
the
waiter
had
brought
a
small
table
for
the
coffee
-
cups
,
and
George
had
placed
his
chair
on
the
other
side
of
that
.
<EOS>
So
that
Alice
was
,
as
it
were
,
a
prisoner
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
slip
away
without
some
special
preparation
for
going
,
and
Kate
had
so
placed
her
chair
in
leaving
,
that
she
must
actually
have
asked
George
to
move
it
before
she
could
escape
.
<EOS>
But
why
should
she
wish
to
escape
?
<EOS>
Nothing
could
be
more
lovely
and
enticing
than
the
scene
before
her
.
<EOS>
The
night
had
come
on
,
with
quick
but
still
unperceived
approach
,
as
it
does
in
those
parts
;
for
the
twilight
there
is
not
prolonged
as
it
is
with
us
more
northern
folk
.
<EOS>
The
night
had
come
on
,
but
there
was
a
rising
moon
,
which
just
sufficed
to
give
a
sheen
to
the
water
beneath
her
.
<EOS>
The
air
was
deliciously
soft
;
 
of
that
softness
which
produces
no
sensation
either
of
warmth
or
cold
,
but
which
just
seems
to
touch
one
with
loving
tenderness
,
as
though
the
unseen
spirits
of
the
air
kissed
one
's
forehead
as
they
passed
on
their
wings
.
<EOS>
The
Rhine
was
running
at
her
feet
,
so
near
,
that
in
the
soft
half
light
it
seemed
as
though
she
might
step
into
its
ripple
.
<EOS>
The
Rhine
was
running
by
with
that
delicious
sound
of
rapidly
moving
waters
,
that
fresh
refreshing
gurgle
of
the
river
,
which
is
so
delicious
to
the
ear
at
all
times
.
<EOS>
If
you
be
talking
,
it
wraps
up
your
speech
,
keeping
it
for
yourselves
,
making
it
difficult
neither
to
her
who
listens
nor
to
him
who
speaks
.
<EOS>
If
you
would
sleep
,
it
is
of
all
lullabies
the
sweetest
.
<EOS>
If
you
are
alone
and
would
think
,
it
aids
all
your
thoughts
.
<EOS>
If
you
are
alone
,
and
,
alas
!
<EOS>
would
not
think
,
 
if
thinking
be
too
painful
,
 
it
will
dispel
your
sorrow
,
and
give
the
comfort
which
music
alone
can
give
.
<EOS>
Alice
felt
that
the
air
kissed
her
,
that
the
river
sang
for
her
its
sweetest
song
,
that
the
moon
shone
for
her
with
its
softest
light
,
 
that
light
which
lends
the
poetry
of
half
-
developed
beauty
to
everything
that
it
touches
.
<EOS>
Why
should
she
leave
it
?
  
<EOS>
Nothing
was
said
for
some
minutes
after
Kate
's
departure
,
and
Alice
was
beginning
to
shake
from
her
that
half
feeling
of
danger
which
had
come
over
her
.
<EOS>
Vavasor
had
sat
back
in
his
chair
,
leaning
against
the
house
,
with
his
feet
raised
upon
a
stool
;
his
arms
were
folded
across
his
breast
,
and
he
seemed
to
have
divided
himself
between
his
thoughts
and
his
cigar
.
<EOS>
Alice
was
looking
full
upon
the
river
,
and
her
thoughts
had
strayed
away
to
her
future
home
among
John
Grey
's
flower
-
beds
and
shrubs
;
but
<EOS>
the
river
,
though
it
sang
to
her
pleasantly
,
seemed
to
sing
a
song
of
other
things
than
such
a
home
as
that
,
 
a
song
full
of
mystery
,
as
are
all
river
songs
when
one
tries
to
understand
their
words
.
  
<EOS>
"
When
are
you
to
be
married
,
Alice
?
"
said
George
at
last
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
George
!
"
said
she
.
<EOS>
"
You
ask
me
a
question
as
though
you
were
putting
a
pistol
to
my
ear
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
sorry
the
question
was
so
unpleasant
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
say
that
it
was
unpleasant
;
but
you
asked
it
so
suddenly
!
<EOS>
The
truth
is
,
I
did
n't
expect
you
to
speak
at
all
just
then
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
I
was
thinking
of
something
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
if
it
be
not
unpleasant
,
 
when
are
you
to
be
married
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
fixed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
about
when
,
I
mean
?
<EOS>
This
summer
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Certainly
not
this
summer
,
for
the
summer
will
be
over
when
we
reach
home
.
"
  
"
This
winter
?
<EOS>
Next
spring
?
<EOS>
Next
year
?
 
<EOS>
or
in
ten
years
"
time
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Before
the
expiration
of
the
ten
years
,
I
suppose
.
<EOS>
Anything
more
exact
than
that
I
ca
n't
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
you
like
it
?
"
<EOS>
he
then
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
,
being
married
?
<EOS>
You
see
I
've
never
tried
yet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
idea
of
it
,
 
the
anticipation
,
You
look
forward
with
satisfaction
to
the
kind
of
life
you
will
lead
at
Nethercoats
?
<EOS>
Do
n't
suppose
I
am
saying
anything
against
it
,
for
I
have
no
conception
what
sort
of
a
place
Nethercoats
is
.
<EOS>
On
the
whole
I
do
n't
know
that
there
is
any
kind
of
life
better
than
that
of
an
English
country
gentleman
in
his
own
place
;
 
that
is
,
if
he
can
keep
it
up
,
and
not
live
as
the
old
squire
does
,
in
a
state
of
chronic
poverty
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Grey
's
place
does
n't
entitle
him
to
be
called
a
country
gentleman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
like
the
prospect
of
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
George
,
how
you
do
cross
-
question
one
!
<EOS>
Of
course
I
like
it
,
or
I
should
n't
have
accepted
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
does
not
follow
.
<EOS>
But
I
quite
acknowledge
that
I
have
no
right
to
cross
-
question
you
.
<EOS>
If
I
ever
had
such
right
on
the
score
of
cousinship
,
I
have
lost
it
on
the
score
of
 
;
but
we
wo
n't
mind
that
,
will
we
,
Alice
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
To
this
she
at
first
made
no
answer
,
but
he
repeated
the
question
.
<EOS>
"
Will
we
,
Alice
?
"
  
"
Will
we
what
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Recur
to
the
old
days
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
should
we
recur
to
them
?
<EOS>
They
are
passed
,
and
as
we
are
again
friends
and
dear
cousins
the
sting
of
them
is
gone
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
yes
!
<EOS>
The
sting
of
them
is
gone
.
<EOS>
It
is
for
that
reason
,
because
it
is
so
,
that
we
may
at
last
recur
to
them
without
danger
.
<EOS>
If
we
regret
nothing
,
 
if
neither
of
us
has
anything
to
regret
,
why
not
recur
to
them
,
and
talk
of
them
freely
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
George
;
that
would
not
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
By
heavens
,
no
!
<EOS>
It
would
drive
me
mad
;
and
if
I
know
aught
of
you
,
it
would
hardly
leave
you
as
calm
as
you
are
at
present
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
As
I
would
wish
to
be
left
calm
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
Would
you
?
<EOS>
Then
I
suppose
I
ought
to
hold
my
tongue
.
<EOS>
But
,
Alice
,
I
shall
never
have
the
power
of
speaking
to
you
again
as
I
speak
now
.
<EOS>
Since
we
have
been
out
together
,
we
have
been
dear
friends
;
is
it
not
so
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
shall
we
not
always
be
dear
friends
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
certainly
not
.
<EOS>
How
will
it
be
possible
?
<EOS>
Think
of
it
.
<EOS>
How
can
I
really
be
your
friend
when
you
are
the
mistress
of
that
man
's
house
in
Cambridgeshire
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
George
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
mean
nothing
disrespectful
.
<EOS>
I
truly
beg
your
pardon
if
it
has
seemed
so
.
<EOS>
Let
me
say
that
gentleman
's
house
;
 
for
he
is
a
gentleman
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
he
certainly
is
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
could
not
have
accepted
him
were
he
not
so
.
<EOS>
But
how
can
I
be
your
friend
when
you
are
his
wife
?
<EOS>
I
may
still
call
you
cousin
Alice
,
and
pat
your
children
on
the
head
if
I
chance
to
see
them
;
and
shall
stop
in
the
streets
and
shake
hands
with
him
if
I
meet
him
;
 
that
is
if
my
untoward
fate
does
not
induce
him
to
cut
my
acquaintance
;
 
but
as
for
friendship
,
that
will
be
over
when
you
and
I
shall
have
parted
next
Thursday
evening
at
London
Bridge
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
George
,
do
n't
say
so
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
why
on
Thursday
?
<EOS>
Do
you
mean
that
you
wo
n't
come
to
Queen
Anne
Street
any
more
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
that
is
what
I
do
mean
.
<EOS>
This
trip
of
ours
has
been
very
successful
,
Kate
says
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
Kate
knows
nothing
about
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
has
been
very
pleasant
,
 
at
least
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
the
pleasure
has
had
no
drawback
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
None
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
has
been
very
pleasant
to
me
,
also
;
 
but
the
pleasure
has
had
its
alloy
.
<EOS>
Alice
,
I
have
nothing
to
ask
from
you
,
 
nothing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Anything
that
you
should
ask
,
I
would
do
for
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
nothing
to
ask
;
 
nothing
.
<EOS>
But
I
have
one
word
to
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
George
,
do
not
say
it
.
<EOS>
Let
me
go
up
-
stairs
.
<EOS>
Let
me
go
to
Kate
.
"
  
"
Certainly
;
if
you
wish
it
you
shall
go
.
"
<EOS>
He
still
held
his
foot
against
the
chair
which
barred
her
passage
,
and
did
not
attempt
to
rise
as
he
must
have
done
to
make
way
for
her
passage
out
.
"
<EOS>
Certainly
you
shall
go
to
Kate
,
if
you
refuse
to
hear
me
.
<EOS>
But
after
all
that
has
passed
between
us
,
after
these
six
weeks
of
intimate
companionship
,
I
think
you
ought
to
listen
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
tell
you
that
I
have
nothing
to
ask
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
going
to
make
love
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Alice
had
commenced
some
attempt
to
rise
,
but
she
had
again
settled
herself
in
her
chair
.
<EOS>
And
now
,
when
he
paused
for
a
moment
,
she
made
no
further
sign
that
she
wished
to
escape
,
nor
did
she
say
a
word
to
intimate
her
further
wish
that
he
should
be
silent
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
going
to
make
love
to
you
,
"
he
said
again
.
"
<EOS>
As
for
making
love
,
as
the
word
goes
,
that
must
be
over
between
you
and
me
.
<EOS>
It
has
been
made
and
marred
,
and
can
not
be
remade
.
<EOS>
It
may
exist
,
or
it
may
have
been
expelled
;
but
where
it
does
not
exist
,
it
will
never
be
brought
back
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
should
not
be
spoken
of
between
you
and
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
So
,
no
doubt
,
any
proper
-
going
duenna
would
say
,
and
so
,
too
,
little
children
should
be
told
;
but
between
you
and
me
there
can
be
no
necessity
for
falsehood
.
<EOS>
We
have
grown
beyond
our
sugar
-
toothed
ages
,
and
are
now
men
and
women
.
<EOS>
I
perfectly
understood
your
breaking
away
from
me
.
<EOS>
I
understood
you
,
and
in
spite
of
my
sorrow
knew
that
you
were
right
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
going
to
accuse
or
to
defend
myself
;
but
I
knew
that
you
were
right
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
let
there
be
no
more
about
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
there
must
be
more
about
it
.
<EOS>
I
did
not
understand
you
when
you
accepted
Mr.
Grey
.
<EOS>
Against
him
I
have
not
a
whisper
to
make
.
<EOS>
He
may
be
perfect
for
aught
I
know
.
<EOS>
But
,
knowing
you
as
I
thought
I
did
,
I
could
not
understand
your
loving
such
a
man
as
him
.
<EOS>
It
was
as
though
one
who
had
lived
on
brandy
should
take
himself
suddenly
to
a
milk
diet
,
 
and
enjoy
the
change
!
<EOS>
A
milk
diet
is
no
doubt
the
best
.
<EOS>
But
men
who
have
lived
on
brandy
ca
n't
make
those
changes
very
suddenly
.
<EOS>
They
perish
in
the
attempt
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
always
,
George
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
may
be
done
with
months
of
agony
;
 
but
there
was
no
such
agony
with
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Who
can
tell
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
will
tell
me
the
cure
was
made
.
<EOS>
I
thought
so
,
and
therefore
thought
that
I
should
find
you
changed
.
<EOS>
I
thought
that
you
,
who
had
been
all
fire
,
would
now
have
turned
yourself
into
soft
-
flowing
milk
and
honey
,
and
have
become
fit
for
the
life
in
store
for
you
.
<EOS>
With
such
a
one
I
might
have
travelled
from
Moscow
to
Malta
without
danger
.
<EOS>
The
woman
fit
to
be
John
Grey
's
wife
<EOS>
would
certainly
do
me
no
harm
,
 
could
not
touch
my
happiness
.
<EOS>
I
might
have
loved
her
once
,
 
might
still
love
the
memory
of
what
she
had
been
;
but
her
,
in
her
new
form
,
after
her
new
birth
,
 
such
a
one
as
that
,
Alice
,
could
be
nothing
to
me
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
mistake
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
enough
of
wisdom
in
me
to
know
how
much
better
,
ay
,
and
happier
a
woman
she
might
be
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
that
I
thought
you
had
descended
in
the
scale
;
but
I
gave
you
credit
for
virtues
which
you
have
not
acquired
.
<EOS>
Alice
,
that
wholesome
diet
of
which
I
spoke
is
not
your
diet
.
<EOS>
You
would
starve
on
it
,
and
perish
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
had
spoken
with
great
energy
,
but
still
in
a
low
voice
,
having
turned
full
round
upon
the
table
,
with
both
his
arms
upon
it
,
and
his
face
stretched
out
far
over
towards
her
.
<EOS>
She
was
looking
full
at
him
;
and
,
as
I
have
said
before
,
that
scar
and
his
gloomy
eyes
and
thick
eyebrows
seemed
to
make
up
the
whole
of
his
face
.
<EOS>
But
the
scar
had
never
been
ugly
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
knew
the
story
,
and
when
he
was
her
lover
she
had
taken
pride
in
the
mark
of
the
wound
.
<EOS>
She
looked
at
him
,
but
though
he
paused
she
did
not
speak
.
<EOS>
The
music
of
the
river
was
still
in
her
ears
,
and
there
came
upon
her
a
struggle
as
though
she
were
striving
to
understand
its
song
.
<EOS>
Were
the
waters
also
telling
her
of
the
mistake
she
had
made
in
accepting
Mr.
Grey
as
her
husband
?
<EOS>
What
her
cousin
was
now
telling
her
,
 
was
it
not
a
repetition
of
words
which
she
had
spoken
to
herself
hundreds
of
times
during
the
last
two
months
?
<EOS>
Was
she
not
telling
herself
daily
,
 
hourly
,
 
always
,
 
in
every
thought
of
her
life
,
that
in
accepting
Mr.
Grey
she
had
assumed
herself
to
be
mistress
of
virtues
which
she
did
not
possess
?
<EOS>
Had
she
not
,
in
truth
,
rioted
upon
brandy
,
till
the
innocence
of
milk
was
unfitted
for
her
?
<EOS>
This
man
now
came
and
rudely
told
her
all
this
,
 
but
did
he
not
tell
her
the
truth
?
<EOS>
She
sat
silent
and
convicted
;
only
gazing
into
his
face
when
his
speech
was
done
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
learned
this
since
we
have
been
again
together
,
Alice
;
and
finding
you
,
not
the
angel
I
had
supposed
,
finding
you
to
be
the
same
woman
I
had
once
loved
,
 
the
safety
that
I
anticipated
has
not
fallen
to
my
lot
.
<EOS>
That
's
all
.
<EOS>
Here
's
Kate
,
and
now
we
'll
go
for
our
walk
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
Bridge
over
the
Rhine
.
 
<EOS>
"
George
,
"
said
Kate
,
speaking
before
she
quite
got
up
to
them
,
"
will
you
tell
me
whether
you
have
been
preparing
all
your
things
for
an
open
sale
by
auction
?
<EOS>
"
Then
she
stole
a
look
at
Alice
,
and
having
learned
from
that
glance
that
something
had
occurred
which
prevented
Alice
from
joining
her
in
her
raillery
,
she
went
on
with
it
herself
rapidly
,
as
though
to
cover
Alice
's
confusion
,
and
give
her
time
to
rally
before
they
should
all
move
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Would
you
believe
it
?
<EOS>
he
had
three
razors
laid
out
on
his
table
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
A
man
must
shave
,
 
even
at
Basle
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
But
not
with
three
razors
at
once
;
and
three
hair
-
brushes
,
and
half
a
dozen
toothbrushes
,
and
a
small
collection
of
combs
,
and
four
or
five
little
glass
bottles
,
looking
as
though
they
contained
poison
,
 
all
with
silver
tops
.
<EOS>
I
can
only
suppose
you
desired
to
startle
the
weak
mind
of
the
chambermaid
.
<EOS>
I
have
put
them
all
up
;
but
remember
this
,
if
they
are
taken
out
again
you
are
responsible
.
<EOS>
And
I
will
not
put
up
your
boots
,
George
.
<EOS>
What
can
you
have
wanted
with
three
pairs
of
boots
at
Basle
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
When
you
have
completed
the
list
of
my
wardrobe
we
'll
go
out
upon
the
bridge
.
<EOS>
That
is
,
if
Alice
likes
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
yes
;
I
shall
like
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Come
along
then
,
"
said
Kate
.
<EOS>
And
so
they
moved
away
.
<EOS>
When
they
got
upon
the
bridge
Alice
and
Kate
were
together
,
while
George
strolled
behind
them
,
close
to
them
,
but
not
taking
any
part
in
their
conversation
,
 
as
though
he
had
merely
gone
with
them
as
an
escort
.
<EOS>
Kate
seemed
to
be
perfectly
content
with
this
arrangement
,
chattering
to
Alice
,
so
that
she
might
show
that
there
was
nothing
serious
on
the
minds
of
any
of
them
.
<EOS>
It
need
hardly
be
said
that
Alice
at
this
time
made
no
appeal
to
George
to
join
them
.
<EOS>
He
followed
them
at
their
heels
,
with
his
hands
behind
his
back
,
looking
down
upon
the
pavement
and
simply
waiting
upon
their
pleasure
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
know
,
"
said
Kate
,
"
I
have
a
very
great
mind
to
run
away
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Where
do
you
want
to
run
to
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
;
 
that
would
n't
much
signify
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
I
'd
go
to
the
little
inn
at
Handek
.
<EOS>
It
's
a
lonely
place
,
where
nobody
would
hear
of
me
,
 
and
I
should
have
the
waterfall
.
<EOS>
I
'm
afraid
they
'd
want
to
have
their
bill
paid
.
<EOS>
That
would
be
the
worst
of
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
why
run
away
just
now
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wo
n't
,
because
you
would
n't
like
going
home
with
George
alone
,
 
<EOS>
and
I
suppose
he
'd
be
bound
to
look
after
me
,
as
he
's
doing
now
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
what
he
thinks
of
having
to
walk
over
the
bridge
after
us
girls
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
he
'd
be
in
that
place
down
there
drinking
beer
,
if
we
were
n't
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
he
wanted
to
go
,
I
dare
say
he
would
,
in
spite
of
us
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
ungrateful
of
you
,
for
I
'm
sure
we
've
never
been
kept
in
a
moment
by
his
failing
us
.
<EOS>
But
as
I
was
saying
,
I
do
dread
going
home
.
<EOS>
You
are
going
to
John
Grey
,
which
may
be
pleasant
enough
;
but
I
'm
going
 
to
Aunt
Greenow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
your
own
choice
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
it
's
not
.
<EOS>
I
have
n't
any
choice
in
the
matter
.
<EOS>
Of
course
I
might
refuse
to
speak
to
Aunt
Greenow
,
and
nobody
could
make
me
;
 
but
practically
I
have
n't
any
choice
in
the
matter
.
<EOS>
Fancy
a
month
at
Yarmouth
with
no
companion
but
such
a
woman
as
that
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
n't
mind
it
.
<EOS>
Aunt
Greenow
always
seems
to
me
to
be
a
very
good
sort
of
woman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
may
be
a
good
woman
,
but
I
must
say
I
think
she
's
of
a
bad
sort
.
<EOS>
You
've
never
heard
her
talk
about
her
husband
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
never
;
I
think
she
did
cry
a
little
the
first
day
she
came
to
Queen
Anne
Street
,
but
that
was
n't
unnatural
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
was
thirty
years
older
than
herself
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
still
he
was
her
husband
.
<EOS>
And
even
if
her
tears
are
assumed
,
what
of
that
?
<EOS>
What
's
a
woman
to
do
?
<EOS>
Of
course
she
was
wrong
to
marry
him
.
<EOS>
She
was
thirty
-
five
,
and
had
nothing
,
while
he
was
sixty
-
five
,
and
was
very
rich
.
<EOS>
According
to
all
accounts
she
made
him
a
very
good
wife
,
and
now
that
she
's
got
all
his
money
,
you
would
n't
have
her
go
about
laughing
within
three
months
of
his
death
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
I
would
n't
have
her
laugh
;
but
neither
would
I
have
her
cry
.
<EOS>
And
she
's
quite
right
to
wear
weeds
;
but
she
need
n't
be
so
very
outrageous
in
the
depth
of
her
hems
,
or
so
very
careful
that
her
caps
are
becoming
.
<EOS>
Her
eyes
will
be
worn
out
by
their
double
service
.
<EOS>
They
are
always
red
with
weeping
,
and
yet
she
is
ready
every
minute
with
a
full
battery
of
execution
for
any
man
that
she
sees
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
why
have
you
consented
to
go
to
Yarmouth
with
her
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Just
because
she
's
got
forty
thousand
pounds
.
<EOS>
If
Mr.
Greenow
had
left
her
with
a
bare
maintenance
I
do
n't
suppose
I
should
ever
have
held
out
my
hand
to
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
you
're
as
bad
as
she
is
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Quite
as
bad
;
 
and
that
's
<EOS>
what
makes
me
want
to
run
away
.
<EOS>
But
it
is
n't
my
own
fault
altogether
.
<EOS>
It
's
the
fault
of
the
world
at
large
.
<EOS>
Does
anybody
ever
drop
their
rich
relatives
?
<EOS>
When
she
proposed
to
take
me
to
Yarmouth
,
was
n't
it
natural
that
the
squire
should
ask
me
to
go
?
<EOS>
When
I
told
George
,
was
n't
it
natural
that
he
should
say
,
"
Oh
,
go
by
all
means
.
<EOS>
She
's
got
forty
thousand
pounds
!
<EOS>
"
One
ca
n't
pretend
to
be
wiser
or
better
than
one
's
relatives
.
<EOS>
And
after
all
what
can
I
expect
from
her
money
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nothing
,
I
should
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
a
halfpenny
.
<EOS>
I
'm
nearly
thirty
<EOS>
and
she
's
only
forty
,
and
of
course
she
'll
marry
again
.
<EOS>
I
will
say
of
myself
,
too
,
that
no
person
living
cares
less
for
money
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
think
no
one
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yet
one
sticks
to
one
's
rich
relatives
.
<EOS>
It
's
the
way
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Then
she
paused
a
moment
.
"
<EOS>
But
shall
I
tell
you
,
Alice
,
why
I
do
stick
to
her
?
<EOS>
Perhaps
you
'll
think
the
object
as
mean
as
though
I
wanted
her
money
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
is
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Because
it
is
on
the
cards
that
she
may
help
George
in
his
career
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
want
money
,
but
he
may
.
<EOS>
And
for
such
purposes
as
his
,
I
think
it
fair
that
all
the
family
should
contribute
.
<EOS>
I
feel
sure
that
he
would
make
a
name
for
himself
in
Parliament
;
and
if
I
had
my
way
I
would
spend
every
shilling
of
Vavasor
money
in
putting
him
there
.
<EOS>
When
I
told
the
squire
<EOS>
so
I
thought
he
would
have
eaten
me
.
<EOS>
I
really
did
think
he
would
have
turned
me
out
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
serve
you
right
too
after
what
had
happened
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
care
.
<EOS>
Let
him
turn
me
out
.
<EOS>
I
was
determined
he
should
know
what
I
thought
.
<EOS>
He
swore
at
me
;
and
then
he
was
so
unhappy
at
what
he
had
done
that
he
came
and
kissed
me
that
night
in
my
bedroom
,
and
gave
me
a
ten
-
pound
note
.
<EOS>
What
do
you
think
I
did
with
it
?
<EOS>
I
sent
it
as
a
contribution
to
the
next
election
and
George
has
it
now
locked
up
in
a
box
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
tell
him
that
I
told
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Then
they
stopped
and
leaned
for
a
while
over
the
parapet
of
the
bridge
.
<EOS>
"
Come
here
,
George
,
"
said
Kate
;
and
she
made
room
for
him
between
herself
and
Alice
.
<EOS>
"
Would
n't
you
like
to
be
swimming
down
there
as
those
boys
were
doing
when
we
went
out
into
the
balcony
?
<EOS>
The
water
looks
so
enticing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
say
I
should
;
 
unless
it
might
be
a
pleasant
way
of
swimming
into
the
next
world
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
so
like
to
feel
myself
going
with
the
stream
,
"
said
Kate
;
"
particularly
by
this
light
.
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
fancy
in
the
least
that
I
should
be
drowned
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
fancy
anything
else
,
"
said
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
so
pleasant
to
feel
the
water
gliding
along
one
's
limbs
,
and
to
be
carried
away
headlong
,
 
knowing
that
you
were
on
the
direct
road
to
Rotterdam
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
so
arrive
there
without
your
clothes
,
"
said
George
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
would
be
brought
after
in
a
boat
.
<EOS>
Did
n't
you
see
that
those
boys
had
a
boat
with
them
?
<EOS>
But
if
I
lived
here
,
I
'd
never
do
it
except
by
moonlight
.
<EOS>
The
water
looks
so
clear
and
bright
now
,
and
the
rushing
sound
of
it
is
so
soft
!
<EOS>
The
sea
at
Yarmouth
wo
n't
be
anything
like
that
I
suppose
.
<EOS>
"
  
Neither
of
them
any
longer
answered
her
,
and
yet
she
went
on
talking
about
the
river
,
and
their
aunt
,
and
her
prospects
at
Yarmouth
.
<EOS>
Neither
of
them
answered
her
,
and
yet
it
seemed
that
they
had
not
a
word
to
say
to
each
other
.
<EOS>
But
still
they
stood
there
looking
down
upon
the
river
,
and
every
now
<EOS>
and
then
Kate
's
voice
was
to
be
heard
,
preventing
the
feeling
which
might
otherwise
have
arisen
that
their
hearts
were
too
full
for
speech
.
  
<EOS>
At
last
Alice
seemed
to
shiver
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
slight
trembling
in
her
arms
,
which
George
felt
rather
than
saw
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
cold
,
"
he
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
are
let
us
go
in
.
<EOS>
I
thought
you
shivered
with
the
night
air
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
n't
that
.
<EOS>
I
was
thinking
of
something
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
ever
think
of
things
that
make
you
shiver
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
I
do
,
very
often
;
 
so
often
that
I
have
to
do
my
shiverings
inwardly
.
<EOS>
Otherwise
people
would
think
I
had
the
palsy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
mean
things
of
moment
,
"
said
Alice
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Little
bits
of
things
make
me
do
it
;
 
perhaps
a
word
that
I
said
and
ought
not
to
have
said
ten
years
ago
;
 
the
most
ordinary
little
mistakes
,
even
my
own
past
thoughts
to
myself
about
the
merest
trifles
.
<EOS>
They
are
always
making
me
shiver
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
not
because
you
have
committed
any
murder
then
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
but
it
's
my
conscience
all
the
same
,
I
suppose
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
I
'm
not
so
good
as
you
.
<EOS>
I
doubt
it
's
not
my
conscience
at
all
.
<EOS>
When
I
think
of
a
chance
I
've
let
go
by
,
as
I
have
thousands
,
then
it
is
that
I
shiver
.
<EOS>
But
,
as
I
tell
you
,
I
shiver
inwardly
.
<EOS>
I
've
been
in
one
long
shiver
ever
since
we
came
out
because
of
one
chance
that
I
let
go
by
.
<EOS>
Come
,
we
'll
go
in
.
<EOS>
We
've
to
be
up
at
five
o'clock
,
and
now
it
's
eleven
.
<EOS>
I
'll
do
the
rest
of
my
shivering
in
bed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
tired
of
being
out
?
"
said
Kate
,
when
the
other
two
began
to
move
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
tired
of
being
out
,
but
George
reminds
me
that
we
have
to
be
up
at
five
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
George
would
hold
his
tongue
.
<EOS>
We
ca
n't
come
to
the
bridge
at
Basle
every
night
in
our
lives
.
<EOS>
If
one
found
oneself
at
the
top
of
Sinai
<EOS>
I
'm
afraid
the
first
feeling
would
be
one
of
fear
lest
one
would
n't
be
down
in
time
to
dress
for
dinner
.
<EOS>
Are
you
aware
,
George
,
that
the
king
of
rivers
is
running
beneath
your
feet
,
and
that
the
moon
is
shining
with
a
brilliance
you
never
see
at
home
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
stay
here
all
night
if
you
'll
put
off
going
to
-
morrow
,
"
said
George
.
  
<EOS>
"
Our
money
would
n't
hold
out
,
"
said
Kate
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
talk
about
Sinai
any
more
after
that
,
"
said
he
,
"
but
let
's
go
in
to
bed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
They
walked
across
the
bridge
back
to
the
hotel
in
the
same
manner
as
before
,
the
two
girls
going
together
with
the
young
man
after
them
,
and
so
they
went
up
the
front
steps
of
the
hotel
,
through
the
hall
,
and
on
to
the
stairs
.
<EOS>
Here
George
handed
Alice
her
candle
,
and
as
he
did
so
he
whispered
a
few
words
to
her
.
<EOS>
"
My
shivering
fit
has
to
come
yet
,
"
said
he
,
"
and
will
last
me
the
whole
night
.
<EOS>
"
She
would
have
given
much
to
be
able
to
answer
him
lightly
,
as
though
what
he
had
said
had
meant
nothing
;
 
but
she
could
n't
do
it
;
the
light
speech
would
not
come
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
was
conscious
of
all
this
,
and
went
away
to
her
own
room
without
answering
him
at
all
.
<EOS>
Here
she
sat
down
at
the
window
looking
out
upon
the
river
till
Kate
should
join
her
.
<EOS>
Their
rooms
opened
through
from
one
to
the
other
,
and
she
would
not
begin
her
packing
till
her
cousin
should
come
.
  
<EOS>
But
Kate
had
gone
with
her
brother
,
promising
,
as
she
did
so
,
that
she
would
be
back
in
half
a
minute
.
<EOS>
That
half
minute
was
protracted
beyond
half
an
hour
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
'll
take
my
advice
,
"
said
Kate
,
at
last
,
standing
up
with
her
candle
in
her
hand
,
"
you
'll
ask
her
in
plain
words
to
give
you
another
chance
.
<EOS>
Do
it
to
-
morrow
at
Strasbourg
;
you
'll
never
have
a
better
opportunity
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
bid
her
throw
John
Grey
over
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
say
anything
about
John
Grey
;
leave
her
to
settle
that
matter
with
herself
.
<EOS>
Believe
me
that
she
has
quite
courage
enough
to
dispose
of
John
Grey
,
if
she
has
courage
enough
to
accept
your
offer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Kate
,
you
women
never
understand
each
other
.
<EOS>
If
I
were
to
do
that
,
all
her
most
powerful
feelings
would
be
arrayed
in
arms
against
me
.
<EOS>
I
must
leave
her
to
find
out
first
that
she
wishes
to
be
rid
of
her
engagement
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
has
found
that
out
long
ago
.
<EOS>
Do
you
think
I
do
n't
know
what
she
wishes
?
<EOS>
But
if
you
ca
n't
bring
yourself
to
speak
to
her
,
she
'll
marry
him
in
spite
of
her
wishes
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Bring
myself
!
<EOS>
I
've
never
been
very
slow
in
bringing
myself
to
speak
to
any
one
when
there
was
need
.
<EOS>
It
is
n't
very
pleasant
sometimes
,
but
I
do
it
,
if
I
find
occasion
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
surely
it
must
be
pleasant
with
her
.
<EOS>
You
must
be
glad
to
find
that
she
still
loves
you
.
<EOS>
You
still
love
her
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
word
I
do
n't
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
n't
provoke
me
,
George
.
<EOS>
I
'm
moving
heaven
and
earth
to
bring
you
two
together
;
but
if
I
did
n't
think
you
loved
her
,
I
'd
go
to
her
at
once
and
bid
her
never
see
you
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
word
,
Kate
,
I
sometimes
think
it
would
be
better
if
you
'd
leave
heaven
and
earth
alone
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
I
will
.
<EOS>
But
of
all
human
beings
,
surely
you
're
the
most
ungrateful
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
should
n't
she
marry
John
Grey
if
she
likes
him
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
she
does
n't
like
him
.
<EOS>
And
I
hate
him
.
<EOS>
I
hate
the
sound
of
his
voice
,
and
the
turn
of
his
eye
,
and
that
slow
,
steady
movement
of
his
,
 
as
though
he
was
always
bethinking
himself
that
he
would
n't
wear
out
his
clothes
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
see
that
your
hating
him
ought
to
have
anything
to
do
with
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
're
going
to
preach
morals
,
I
'll
leave
you
.
<EOS>
It
's
the
darling
wish
of
my
heart
that
she
should
be
your
wife
.
<EOS>
If
you
ever
loved
anybody
,
 
and
I
sometimes
doubt
whether
you
ever
did
,
 
but
if
you
did
,
you
loved
her

"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
and
do
are
different
things

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
well
,
George
;
then
I
have
done
.
<EOS>
It
has
been
the
same
in
every
twist
and
turn
of
my
life
.
<EOS>
In
everything
that
I
have
striven
to
do
for
you

you
have
thrown
yourself
over
,
in
order

I
might
be
thrown
over
too

this
merely
to
vex
me

not

told

everything

used

No
;
 
if
I
thought
so
,
I
would
have
no
hand
in
doing
it
.
<EOS>
She
would
be
miserable
with
him
,
and
make
him
miserable
as
well
.
<EOS>
She
does
not
really
love
him
.
<EOS>
He
loves
her
,
but
I
've
nothing
to
do
with
that
.
<EOS>
It
's
nothing
to
me
if
he
breaks
his
heart
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
break
mine
if
you
do
n't
let
me
go
to
bed
.
"
  
<EOS>
With
that
she
went
away
and
hurried
along
the
corridor
,
till
she
came
to
her
cousin
's
room
.
<EOS>
She
found
Alice
still
seated
at
the
window
,
or
rather
kneeling
on
the
chair
,
with
her
head
out
through
the
lattice
.
<EOS>
"
Why
,
you
lazy
creature
,
"
said
Kate
;
<EOS>
"
I
declare
you
have
n't
touched
a
thing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
said
we
'd
do
it
together
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
he
has
kept
me
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
what
a
man
he
is
!
<EOS>
If
he
ever
does
get
married
,
what
will
his
wife
do
with
him
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
he
ever
will
,
"
said
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
you
?
<EOS>
I
dare
say
you
understand
him
better
than
I
do
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
I
think
that
the
only
thing
wanting
to
make
him
thoroughly
good
,
is
a
wife
.
<EOS>
But
it
is
n't
every
woman
that
would
do
for
him
.
<EOS>
And
the
woman
who
marries
him
should
have
high
courage
.
<EOS>
There
are
moments
with
him
when
he
is
very
wild
;
but
he
never
is
cruel
and
never
hard
.
<EOS>
Is
Mr.
Grey
ever
hard
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Never
;
nor
yet
wild
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
certainly
not
that
.
<EOS>
I
'm
quite
sure
he
's
never
wild
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
When
you
say
that
,
Kate
,
I
know
that
you
mean
to
abuse
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
upon
my
word
.
<EOS>
What
's
the
good
of
abusing
him
to
you
?
<EOS>
I
like
a
man
to
be
wild
,
 
wild
in
my
sense
.
<EOS>
You
knew
that
before
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
whether
you
'd
like
a
wild
man
for
yourself
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
that
's
a
question
I
've
never
asked
myself
.
<EOS>
I
've
been
often
curious
to
consider
what
sort
of
husband
would
suit
you
,
but
I
've
had
very
few
thoughts
about
a
husband
for
myself
.
<EOS>
The
truth
is
,
I
'm
married
to
George
.
<EOS>
Ever
since
 
"
  
"
Ever
since
what
?
"
  
"
Since
you
and
he
were
parted
,
I
've
had
nothing
to
do
in
life
but
to
stick
to
him
.
<EOS>
And
I
shall
do
so
to
the
end
,
 
unless
one
thing
should
happen
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
's
that
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Unless
you
should
become
his
wife
after
all
.
<EOS>
He
will
never
marry
anybody
else
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Kate
,
you
should
n't
allude
to
such
a
thing
now
.
<EOS>
You
know
that
it
's
impossible
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
perhaps
so
.
<EOS>
As
far
as
I
'm
concerned
,
it
is
all
the
better
for
me
.
<EOS>
If
George
ever
married
,
I
should
have
nothing
to
do
in
the
world
;
 
literally
nothing
 
<EOS>
nothing
 
<EOS>
nothing
 
nothing
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Kate
,
do
n't
talk
in
that
way
,
"
and
Alice
came
up
to
her
and
embraced
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Go
away
,
"
said
she
.
<EOS>
"
Go
,
Alice
<EOS>
;
you
and
I
must
part
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
bear
it
any
longer
.
<EOS>
You
must
know
it
all
.
<EOS>
When
you
are
married
to
John
Grey
,
our
friendship
must
be
over
.
<EOS>
If
you
became
George
's
wife
I
should
become
nobody
.
<EOS>
I
've
nothing
else
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
You
and
he
would
be
so
all
-
sufficient
for
each
other
,
that
I
should
drop
away
from
you
like
an
old
garment
.
<EOS>
But
I
'd
give
up
all
,
everything
,
<EOS>
every
hope
I
have
,
to
see
you
become
George
's
wife
.
<EOS>
I
know
myself
not
to
be
good
.
<EOS>
I
know
myself
to
be
very
bad
,
and
yet
I
care
nothing
for
myself
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
Alice
,
do
n't
;
I
do
n't
want
your
caresses
.
<EOS>
Caress
him
,
and
I
'll
kneel
at
your
feet
and
cover
them
with
kisses
.
<EOS>
"
She
had
now
thrown
herself
upon
a
sofa
,
and
had
turned
her
face
away
to
the
wall
.
  
<EOS>
"
Kate
,
you
should
n't
speak
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
I
should
n't
,
 
<EOS>
but
I
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
,
who
know
everything
,
must
know
that
I
can
not
marry
your
brother
,
 
even
if
he
wished
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
does
wish
it

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
though
I
were
under
no
other
engagement

<EOS>
"
  
"
And
why
not
?
"
said
Kate
,
again
starting
up
.
<EOS>
"
What
is
there
to
separate
you
from
George
now
,
but
that
unfortunate
affair
,
that
will
end
in
the
misery
of
you
all
.
<EOS>
Do
you
think
I
ca
n't
see
?
<EOS>
Do
n't
I
know
which
of
the
two
men
you
like
best
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
making
me
sorry
,
Kate
,
that
I
have
ventured
to
come
here
in
your
brother
's
company
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
only
unkind
of
you
to
talk
to
me
in
this
way
,
but
worse
than
that
 
<EOS>
it
is
indelicate
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
indelicate
!
<EOS>
How
I
do
hate
that
word
.
<EOS>
If
any
word
in
the
language
reminds
me
of
a
whited
sepulchre
it
is
that
;
 
all
clean
and
polished
outside
with
filth
and
rottenness
within
.
<EOS>
Are
your
thoughts
delicate
?
<EOS>
that
's
the
thing
.
<EOS>
You
are
engaged
to
marry
John
Grey
.
<EOS>
That
may
be
delicate
enough
if
you
love
him
truly
,
and
feel
yourself
fitted
to
be
his
wife
;
but
it
's
about
the
most
indelicate
thing
you
can
do
,
if
you
love
any
one
better
than
him
.
<EOS>
Delicacy
with
many
women
is
like
their
cleanliness
.
<EOS>
Nothing
can
be
nicer
than
the
whole
outside
get
-
up
,
but
you
would
n't
wish
to
answer
for
anything
beneath
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
think
ill
of
me
like
that
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
No
;
I
do
n't
think
ill
of
you
.
<EOS>
How
can
I
think
ill
of
you
when
I
know
that
all
your
difficulties
have
come
from
him
?
<EOS>
It
has
n't
been
your
fault
;
it
has
been
his
throughout
.
<EOS>
It
is
he
who
has
driven
you
to
sacrifice
yourself
on
this
altar
.
<EOS>
If
we
can
,
both
of
us
,
manage
to
lay
aside
all
delicacy
and
pretence
,
and
dare
to
speak
the
truth
,
we
shall
acknowledge
that
it
is
so
.
<EOS>
Had
Mr.
Grey
come
to
you
while
things
were
smooth
between
you
and
George
,
would
you
have
thought
it
possible
that
he
could
be
George
's
rival
in
your
estimation
?
<EOS>
It
is
Hyperion
to
Satyr
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
which
is
the
Satyr
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
leave
your
heart
to
tell
you
.
<EOS>
You
know
what
is
the
darling
wish
of
my
heart
.
<EOS>
But
,
Alice
,
if
I
thought
that
Mr.
Grey
was
to
you
Hyperion
,
 
if
I
thought
that
you
could
marry
him
with
that
sort
of
worshipping
,
idolatrous
love
which
makes
a
girl
proud
as
well
as
happy
in
her
marriage
,
I
would
n't
raise
a
little
finger
to
prevent
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
To
this
Alice
made
no
answer
,
and
then
Kate
allowed
the
matter
to
drop
.
<EOS>
Alice
made
no
answer
,
though
she
felt
that
she
was
allowing
judgement
to
go
against
her
by
default
in
not
doing
so
.
<EOS>
She
had
intended
to
fight
bravely
,
and
to
have
maintained
the
excellence
of
her
present
position
as
the
affianced
bride
of
Mr.
Grey
,
but
she
felt
that
she
had
failed
.
<EOS>
She
felt
that
she
had
,
in
some
sort
,
acknowledged
that
the
match
was
one
to
be
deplored
;
 
that
her
words
in
her
own
defence
would
by
no
means
have
satisfied
Mr.
Grey
,
if
Mr.
Grey
could
have
heard
them
;
 
that
they
would
have
induced
him
to
offer
her
back
her
troth
rather
than
have
made
him
happy
as
a
lover
.
<EOS>
But
she
had
nothing
further
to
say
.
<EOS>
She
could
do
something
.
<EOS>
She
would
hurry
home
and
bid
him
name
the
earliest
day
he
pleased
.
<EOS>
After
that
her
cousin
would
cease
to
disturb
her
in
her
career
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
nearly
one
o'clock
before
the
two
girls
began
to
prepare
for
their
morning
start
,
and
Alice
,
when
they
had
finished
their
packing
,
seemed
to
be
worn
out
with
fatigue
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
are
tired
,
dear
,
we
'll
put
it
off
,
"
said
Kate
.
<EOS>
"
Not
for
worlds
,
"
said
Alice
.
<EOS>
"
For
half
a
word
we
'll
do
it
,
"
continued
Kate
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
slip
out
to
George
and
tell
him
,
and
there
's
nothing
he
'd
like
so
much
.
"
<EOS>
But
Alice
would
not
consent
.
  
<EOS>
About
two
they
got
into
bed
,
and
punctually
at
six
they
were
at
the
railway
station
.
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
speak
to
me
,
"
said
George
,
when
he
met
them
at
their
door
in
the
passage
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
only
yawn
in
your
face
.
"
<EOS>
However
,
they
were
in
time
,
 
which
means
abroad
that
they
were
at
the
station
half
an
hour
before
their
train
started
,
 
and
they
went
on
upon
their
journey
to
Strasbourg
.
  
<EOS>
There
is
nothing
further
to
be
told
of
their
tour
.
<EOS>
They
were
but
two
days
and
nights
on
the
road
from
Basle
to
London
;
and
during
those
two
days
and
nights
neither
George
nor
Kate
spoke
a
word
to
Alice
of
her
marriage
,
nor
was
any
allusion
made
to
the
balcony
at
the
inn
,
or
to
the
bridge
over
the
river
.
   
<EOS>
Aunt
Greenow
.
 
<EOS>
Kate
Vavasor
remained
only
three
days
in
London
before
she
started
for
Yarmouth
;
and
during
those
three
days
she
was
not
much
with
her
cousin
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
my
aunt
's
,
body
and
soul
,
for
the
next
six
weeks
,
"
she
said
to
Alice
,
when
she
did
come
to
Queen
Anne
Street
on
the
morning
after
her
arrival
.
"
<EOS>
And
she
is
exigeant
in
a
manner
I
ca
n't
at
all
explain
to
you
.
<EOS>
You
must
n't
be
surprised
if
I
do
n't
even
write
a
line
.
<EOS>
I
've
escaped
by
stealth
now
.
<EOS>
She
went
up
-
stairs
to
try
on
some
new
weeds
for
the
seaside
,
and
then
I
bolted
.
<EOS>
"
She
did
not
say
a
word
about
George
;
nor
during
those
three
days
,
nor
for
some
days
afterwards
,
did
George
show
himself
.
<EOS>
As
it
turned
out
afterwards
,
he
had
gone
off
to
Scotland
,
and
had
remained
a
week
among
the
grouse
.
<EOS>
Thus
,
at
least
,
he
had
accounted
for
himself
and
his
movements
;
but
all
George
Vavasor
's
friends
knew
that
his
goings
out
and
comings
in
were
seldom
accounted
for
openly
like
those
of
other
men
.
  
<EOS>
It
will
perhaps
be
as
well
to
say
a
few
words
about
Mrs.
Greenow
before
we
go
with
her
to
Yarmouth
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Greenow
was
the
only
daughter
and
the
youngest
child
of
the
old
squire
at
Vavasor
Hall
.
<EOS>
She
was
just
ten
years
younger
than
her
brother
John
,
and
I
am
inclined
to
think
that
she
was
almost
justified
in
her
repeated
assertion
that
the
difference
was
much
greater
than
ten
years
,
by
the
freshness
of
her
colour
,
and
by
the
general
juvenility
of
her
appearance
.
<EOS>
She
certainly
did
not
look
forty
,
and
who
can
expect
a
woman
to
proclaim
herself
to
be
older
than
her
looks
?
<EOS>
In
early
life
she
had
been
taken
from
her
father
's
house
,
and
had
lived
with
relatives
in
one
of
the
large
towns
in
the
north
of
England
.
<EOS>
It
is
certain
she
had
not
been
quite
successful
as
a
girl
.
<EOS>
Though
she
had
enjoyed
the
name
of
being
a
beauty
,
she
had
not
the
usual
success
which
comes
from
such
repute
.
<EOS>
At
thirty
-
four
she
was
still
unmarried
.
<EOS>
She
had
,
moreover
,
acquired
the
character
of
being
a
flirt
;
and
I
fear
that
the
stories
which
were
told
of
her
,
though
doubtless
more
than
half
false
,
had
in
them
sufficient
of
truth
to
justify
the
character
.
<EOS>
Now
this
was
very
sad
,
seeing
that
Arabella
Vavasor
had
no
fortune
,
and
that
she
had
offended
her
father
and
brothers
by
declining
to
comply
with
their
advice
at
certain
periods
of
her
career
.
<EOS>
There
was
,
indeed
,
considerable
trouble
in
the
minds
of
the
various
male
Vavasors
with
reference
to
Arabella
,
when
tidings
suddenly
reached
the
Hall
that
she
was
going
to
be
married
to
an
old
man
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
married
to
the
old
man
;
and
the
marriage
fortunately
turned
out
satisfactorily
,
at
any
rate
for
the
old
man
and
for
her
family
.
<EOS>
The
Vavasors
were
relieved
from
all
further
trouble
,
and
were
as
much
surprised
as
gratified
when
they
heard
that
she
did
her
duty
well
in
her
new
position
.
<EOS>
Arabella
had
long
been
a
thorn
in
their
side
,
never
having
really
done
anything
which
they
could
pronounce
to
be
absolutely
wrong
,
but
always
giving
them
cause
for
fear
.
<EOS>
Now
they
feared
no
longer
.
<EOS>
Her
husband
was
a
retired
merchant
,
very
rich
,
not
very
strong
in
health
,
and
devoted
to
his
bride
.
<EOS>
Rumours
soon
made
their
way
to
Vavasor
Hall
,
and
to
Queen
Anne
Street
,
that
Mrs.
Greenow
was
quite
a
pattern
wife
,
and
that
Mr.
Greenow
considered
himself
to
be
the
happiest
old
man
in
Lancashire
.
<EOS>
And
now
in
her
prosperity
she
quite
forgave
the
former
slights
which
had
been
put
upon
her
by
her
relatives
.
<EOS>
She
wrote
to
her
dear
niece
Alice
,
and
to
her
dearest
niece
Kate
,
and
sent
little
presents
to
her
father
.
<EOS>
On
one
occasion
she
took
her
husband
to
Vavasor
Hall
,
and
there
was
a
regular
renewal
of
all
the
old
family
feelings
.
<EOS>
Arabella
's
husband
was
an
old
man
,
and
was
very
old
for
his
age
;
but
the
whole
thing
was
quite
respectable
,
and
there
was
,
at
any
rate
,
no
doubt
about
the
money
.
<EOS>
Then
Mr.
Greenow
died
;
and
the
widow
,
having
proved
the
will
,
came
up
to
London
and
claimed
the
commiseration
of
her
nieces
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
not
go
to
Yarmouth
with
her
for
a
month
?
<EOS>
"
George
had
said
to
Kate
.
<EOS>
"
Of
course
it
will
be
a
bore
.
<EOS>
But
an
aunt
with
forty
thousand
pounds
has
a
right
to
claim
attention
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Kate
acknowledged
the
truth
of
the
argument
and
agreed
to
go
to
Yarmouth
for
a
month
.
"
<EOS>
Your
aunt
Arabella
has
shown
herself
to
be
a
very
sensible
woman
,
"
the
old
squire
had
written
;
"
much
more
sensible
than
anybody
thought
her
before
her
marriage
.
<EOS>
Of
course
you
should
go
with
her
if
she
asks
you
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
aunt
,
uncle
,
or
cousin
,
in
the
uncontrolled
possession
of
forty
thousand
pounds
was
ever
unpopular
in
the
family
?
  
<EOS>
Yarmouth
is
not
a
very
prepossessing
place
to
the
eye
.
<EOS>
To
my
eye
,
at
any
rate
,
it
is
not
so
.
<EOS>
There
is
an
old
town
with
which
summer
visitors
have
little
or
nothing
to
do
;
and
there
are
the
new
houses
down
by
the
sea
-
side
,
to
which
,
at
any
rate
,
belongs
the
full
advantage
of
sea
air
.
<EOS>
A
kind
of
esplanade
runs
for
nearly
a
mile
along
the
sands
,
and
there
are
built
,
or
in
the
course
of
building
,
rows
of
houses
appropriated
to
summer
visitors
all
looking
out
upon
the
sea
.
<EOS>
There
is
no
beauty
unless
the
yellow
sandy
sea
can
be
called
beautiful
.
<EOS>
The
coast
is
low
and
straight
,
and
the
east
wind
blows
full
upon
it
.
<EOS>
But
the
place
is
healthy
;
and
Mrs.
Greenow
was
probably
right
in
thinking
that
she
might
there
revive
some
portion
of
the
health
which
she
had
lost
in
watching
beside
the
couch
of
her
departing
lord
.
  
<EOS>
"
Omnibus
;
 
<EOS>
no
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
Jeannette
,
get
me
a
fly
.
<EOS>
"
These
were
the
first
words
Mrs.
Greenow
spoke
as
she
put
her
foot
upon
the
platform
at
the
Yarmouth
station
.
<EOS>
Her
maid
's
name
was
Jenny
;
but
Kate
had
already
found
,
somewhat
to
her
dismay
,
that
orders
had
been
issued
before
they
left
London
that
the
girl
was
henceforth
to
be
called
Jeannette
.
<EOS>
Kate
had
also
already
found
that
her
aunt
could
be
imperious
;
but
this
taste
for
masterdom
had
not
shown
itself
so
plainly
in
London
as
it
did
from
the
moment
that
the
train
had
left
the
station
at
Shoreditch
.
<EOS>
In
London
Mrs.
Greenow
had
been
among
Londoners
,
and
her
career
had
hitherto
been
provincial
.
<EOS>
Her
spirit
,
no
doubt
,
had
been
somewhat
cowed
by
the
novelty
of
her
position
.
<EOS>
But
when
she
felt
herself
to
be
once
beyond
the
stones
as
the
saying
used
to
be
,
she
was
herself
again
;
and
at
Ipswich
she
had
ordered
Jeannette
to
get
her
a
glass
of
sherry
with
an
air
which
had
created
a
good
deal
of
attention
among
the
guards
and
porters
.
  
<EOS>
The
fly
was
procured
;
and
with
considerable
exertion
<EOS>
all
Mrs.
Greenow
's
boxes
,
together
with
the
more
moderate
belongings
of
her
niece
and
maid
,
were
stowed
on
the
top
of
it
,
round
upon
the
driver
's
body
on
the
coach
box
,
on
the
maid
's
lap
,
and
I
fear
in
Kate
's
also
,
and
upon
the
vacant
seat
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
large
house
in
Montpelier
Parade
,
"
said
Mrs.
Greenow
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
is
all
large
,
ma'am
,
"
said
the
driver
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
largest
,
"
said
Mrs.
Greenow
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
're
much
of
a
muchness
,
"
said
the
driver
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
Mrs.
Jones
's
,
"
said
Mrs.
Greenow
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
was
particularly
told
it
was
the
largest
in
the
row
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jones
's
well
,
"
said
the
driver
,
<EOS>
and
away
they
went
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jones
's
house
was
handsome
and
comfortable
;
but
I
fear
Mrs.
Greenow
's
satisfaction
in
this
respect
was
impaired
by
her
disappointment
in
finding
that
it
was
not
perceptibly
bigger
than
those
to
the
right
and
left
of
her
.
<EOS>
Her
ambition
in
this
and
in
other
similar
matters
would
have
amused
Kate
greatly
had
she
been
a
bystander
,
and
not
one
of
her
aunt
's
party
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Greenow
was
good
-
natured
,
liberal
,
and
not
by
nature
selfish
;
but
she
was
determined
not
to
waste
the
good
things
which
fortune
had
given
,
and
desired
that
all
the
world
should
see
that
she
had
forty
thousand
pounds
of
her
own
.
<EOS>
And
in
doing
this
she
was
repressed
by
no
feeling
of
false
shame
.
<EOS>
She
never
hesitated
in
her
demands
through
bashfulness
.
<EOS>
She
called
aloud
for
such
comfort
and
grandeur
as
Yarmouth
could
afford
her
,
and
was
well
pleased
that
all
around
should
hear
her
calling
.
<EOS>
Joined
to
all
this
was
her
uncontrolled
grief
for
her
husband
's
death
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
Greenow
!
sweet
lamb
!
<EOS>
Oh
,
Kate
,
if
you
'd
only
known
that
man
!
"
<EOS>
When
she
said
this
she
was
sitting
in
the
best
of
Mrs.
Jones
's
sitting
-
rooms
,
waiting
to
have
dinner
announced
.
<EOS>
She
had
taken
a
drawing
-
room
and
dining
-
room
,
"
because
,
"
as
she
had
said
,
"
she
did
n't
see
why
people
should
be
stuffy
when
they
went
to
the
seaside
;
 
not
if
they
had
means
to
make
themselves
comfortable
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Kate
,
I
do
wish
you
'd
known
him
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
had
,
"
said
Kate
,
 
very
untruly
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
unfortunately
away
when
he
went
to
Vavasor
Hall
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
yes
;
but
it
was
at
home
,
in
the
domestic
circle
,
that
Greenow
should
have
been
seen
to
be
appreciated
.
<EOS>
I
was
a
happy
woman
,
Kate
,
while
that
lasted
.
"
<EOS>
And
Kate
was
surprised
to
see
that
real
tears
 
one
or
two
on
each
side
 
were
making
their
way
down
her
aunt
's
cheeks
.
<EOS>
But
they
were
soon
checked
with
a
handkerchief
of
the
broadest
hem
and
of
the
finest
cambric
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dinner
,
ma'am
,
"
said
Jeannette
,
opening
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
Jeannette
,
I
told
you
always
to
say
that
dinner
was
served
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Dinner
's
served
then
,
"
said
Jeannette
in
a
tone
of
anger
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
,
Kate
,
"
said
her
aunt
.
<EOS>
"
I
've
but
little
appetite
myself
,
but
there
's
no
reason
you
should
n't
eat
your
dinner
.
<EOS>
I
specially
wrote
to
Mrs.
Jones
to
have
some
sweetbread
.
<EOS>
I
do
hope
she
's
got
a
decent
cook
.
<EOS>
It
's
very
little
<EOS>
I
eat
myself
,
but
I
do
like
to
see
things
nice
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
next
day
was
Sunday
;
and
it
was
beautiful
to
see
how
Mrs.
Greenow
went
to
church
in
all
the
glory
of
widowhood
.
<EOS>
There
had
been
a
great
unpacking
after
that
banquet
on
the
sweetbread
,
and
all
her
funereal
millinery
had
been
displayed
before
Kate
's
wondering
eyes
.
<EOS>
The
charm
of
the
woman
was
in
this
,
 
that
she
was
not
in
the
least
ashamed
of
anything
that
she
did
.
<EOS>
She
turned
over
all
her
wardrobe
of
mourning
,
showing
the
richness
of
each
article
,
the
stiffness
of
the
crape
,
the
fineness
of
the
cambric
,
the
breadth
of
the
frills
,
 
telling
the
price
of
each
to
a
shilling
,
while
she
explained
how
the
whole
had
been
amassed
without
any
consideration
of
expense
.
<EOS>
This
she
did
with
all
the
pride
of
a
young
bride
when
she
shows
the
glories
of
her
trousseau
to
the
friend
of
her
bosom
.
<EOS>
Jeannette
stood
by
the
while
,
removing
one
thing
and
exhibiting
another
.
<EOS>
Now
and
again
through
the
performance
,
Mrs.
Greenow
would
rest
a
while
from
her
employment
,
and
address
the
shade
of
the
departed
one
in
terms
of
most
endearing
affection
.
<EOS>
In
the
midst
of
this
Mrs.
Jones
came
in
;
but
the
widow
was
not
a
whit
abashed
by
the
presence
of
the
stranger
.
<EOS>
"
Peace
be
to
his
manes
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
at
last
,
as
she
carefully
folded
up
a
huge
black
crape
mantilla
.
<EOS>
She
made
,
however
,
but
one
syllable
of
the
classical
word
,
and
Mrs.
Jones
thought
that
her
lodger
had
addressed
herself
to
the
mortal
"
remains
"
of
her
deceased
lord
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
left
her
uncommon
well
off
,
I
suppose
,
"
said
Mrs.
Jones
to
Jeannette
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
may
say
that
,
ma'am
.
<EOS>
It
's
more
nor
a
hundred
thousand
of
pounds
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Pounds
of
sterling
,
ma'am
!
<EOS>
Indeed
it
is
;
 
to
my
knowledge
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
do
n't
she
have
a
carriage
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
So
she
do
;
 
but
a
lady
ca
n't
bring
her
carriage
down
to
the
sea
when
she
's
only
just
buried
her
husband
as
one
may
say
.
<EOS>
What
'd
folks
say
if
they
saw
her
in
her
own
carriage
?
<EOS>
But
it
ai
n't
because
she
ca
n't
afford
it
,
Mrs.
Jones
.
<EOS>
And
now
we
're
talking
of
it
<EOS>
you
must
order
a
fly
for
church
to
-
morrow
<EOS>
,
that
'll
look
private
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
She
said
I
was
to
get
a
man
that
had
a
livery
coat
and
gloves
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
man
with
the
coat
and
gloves
was
procured
;
and
Mrs.
Greenow
's
entry
into
church
made
quite
a
sensation
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
thoughtfulness
about
her
<EOS>
which
alone
showed
that
she
was
a
woman
of
no
ordinary
power
.
<EOS>
She
foresaw
all
necessities
,
and
made
provision
for
all
emergencies
.
<EOS>
Another
would
not
have
secured
an
eligible
sitting
,
and
been
at
home
in
Yarmouth
church
,
till
half
the
period
of
her
sojourn
there
was
over
.
<EOS>
But
Mrs.
Greenow
had
done
it
all
.
<EOS>
She
walked
up
the
middle
aisle
with
as
much
self
-
possession
as
though
the
chancel
had
belonged
to
her
family
for
years
;
and
the
respectable
pew
-
opener
absolutely
deserted
two
or
three
old
ladies
whom
she
was
attending
,
to
show
Mrs.
Greenow
into
her
seat
.
<EOS>
When
seated
,
she
was
the
cynosure
of
all
eyes
.
<EOS>
Kate
Vavasor
became
immediately
aware
that
a
great
sensation
had
been
occasioned
by
their
entrance
,
and
equally
aware
that
none
of
it
was
due
to
her
.
<EOS>
I
regret
to
say
that
this
feeling
continued
to
show
itself
throughout
the
whole
service
.
<EOS>
How
many
ladies
of
forty
go
to
church
without
attracting
the
least
attention
!
<EOS>
But
it
is
hardly
too
much
to
say
that
every
person
in
that
church
had
looked
at
Mrs.
Greenow
.
<EOS>
I
doubt
if
there
was
present
there
a
single
married
lady
who
,
on
leaving
the
building
,
did
not
speak
to
her
husband
of
the
widow
.
<EOS>
There
had
prevailed
during
the
whole
two
hours
a
general
though
unexpressed
conviction
that
something
worthy
of
remark
had
happened
that
morning
.
<EOS>
It
had
an
effect
even
upon
the
curate
's
reading
;
and
the
incumbent
,
while
preaching
his
sermon
,
could
not
keep
his
eyes
off
that
wonderful
bonnet
and
veil
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
next
morning
,
before
eleven
,
Mrs.
Greenow
's
name
was
put
down
at
the
Assembly
Room
.
<EOS>
"
I
need
hardly
say
that
in
my
present
condition
I
care
nothing
for
these
things
.
<EOS>
Of
course
I
would
sooner
be
alone
.
<EOS>
But
,
my
dear
Kate
,
I
know
what
I
owe
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Kate
,
with
less
intelligence
than
might
have
been
expected
from
one
so
clever
,
began
to
assure
her
aunt
that
she
required
no
society
;
and
that
,
coming
thus
with
her
to
the
seaside
in
the
early
days
of
her
widowhood
,
she
had
been
well
aware
that
they
would
live
retired
.
<EOS>
But
Mrs.
Greenow
soon
put
her
down
,
and
did
so
without
the
slightest
feeling
of
shame
or
annoyance
on
her
own
part
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
,
"
she
said
,
"
in
this
matter
you
must
let
me
do
what
I
know
to
be
right
.
<EOS>
I
should
consider
myself
to
be
very
selfish
if
I
allowed
my
grief
to
interfere
with
your
amusements
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
aunt
,
I
do
n't
care
for
such
amusements
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
nonsense
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
You
ought
to
care
for
them
.
<EOS>
How
are
you
to
settle
yourself
in
life
if
you
do
n't
care
for
them
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
aunt
,
I
am
settled
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Settled
!
"
said
Mrs.
Greenow
,
astounded
,
as
though
there
must
have
been
some
hidden
marriage
of
which
she
had
not
heard
.
<EOS>
"
But
that
's
nonsense
.
<EOS>
Of
course
you
're
not
settled
;
and
how
are
you
to
be
,
if
I
allow
you
to
shut
yourself
up
in
such
a
place
as
this
,
 
just
where
a
girl
has
a
chance
?
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
in
vain
that
Kate
tried
to
stop
her
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
easy
to
stop
Mrs.
Greenow
when
she
was
supported
by
the
full
assurance
of
being
mistress
of
the
place
and
of
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
my
dear
;
I
know
very
well
what
I
owe
to
you
,
and
I
shall
do
my
duty
.
<EOS>
As
I
said
before
,
society
can
have
no
charms
now
for
such
a
one
as
I
am
.
<EOS>
All
that
social
intercourse
could
ever
do
for
me
<EOS>
lies
buried
in
my
darling
's
grave
.
<EOS>
My
heart
is
desolate
,
and
must
remain
so
.
<EOS>
But
I
'm
not
going
to
immolate
you
on
the
altars
of
my
grief
.
<EOS>
I
shall
force
myself
to
go
out
for
your
sake
,
Kate
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
dear
aunt
,
the
world
will
think
it
<EOS>
so
odd
,
just
at
present
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
care
twopence
for
the
world
.
<EOS>
What
can
the
world
do
to
me
?
<EOS>
I
'm
not
dependent
on
the
world
,
 
thanks
to
the
care
of
that
sainted
lamb
.
<EOS>
I
can
hold
my
own
;
and
as
long
as
I
can
do
that
the
world
wo
n't
hurt
me
.
<EOS>
No
,
Kate
,
if
I
think
a
thing
's
right
I
shall
do
it
.
<EOS>
I
mean
to
make
the
place
pleasant
for
you
if
I
can
,
and
the
world
may
object
if
it
likes
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Greenow
was
probably
right
in
her
appreciation
of
the
value
of
her
independence
.
<EOS>
Remarks
may
perhaps
have
been
made
by
the
world
of
Yarmouth
as
to
her
early
return
to
society
.
<EOS>
People
,
no
doubt
,
did
remind
each
other
that
old
Greenow
was
hardly
yet
four
months
buried
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jones
and
Jeannette
probably
had
their
little
jokes
down
-
stairs
.
<EOS>
But
this
did
not
hurt
Mrs.
Greenow
.
<EOS>
What
was
said
,
was
not
said
in
her
hearing
,
Mrs.
Jones
's
bills
were
paid
every
Saturday
with
admirable
punctuality
;
and
as
long
as
this
was
done
everybody
about
the
house
treated
the
lady
with
that
deference
which
was
due
to
the
respectability
of
her
possessions
.
<EOS>
When
a
recently
bereaved
widow
attempts
to
enjoy
her
freedom
without
money
,
then
it
behoves
the
world
to
speak
aloud
;
 
and
the
world
does
its
duty
.
  
<EOS>
Numerous
people
came
to
call
at
Montpelier
Parade
,
and
Kate
was
astonished
to
find
that
her
aunt
had
so
many
friends
.
<EOS>
She
was
indeed
so
bewildered
by
these
strangers
that
she
could
hardly
ascertain
whom
her
aunt
had
really
known
before
,
and
whom
she
now
saw
for
the
first
time
.
<EOS>
Somebody
had
known
somebody
who
had
known
somebody
else
,
and
that
was
allowed
to
be
a
sufficient
introduction
,
 
always
presuming
that
the
existing
somebody
was
backed
by
some
known
advantages
of
money
or
position
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Greenow
could
smile
from
beneath
her
widow
's
cap
in
a
most
bewitching
way
.
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
word
then
she
is
really
handsome
,
"
Kate
wrote
one
day
to
Alice
.
<EOS>
But
she
could
also
frown
,
and
knew
well
how
to
put
aside
,
or
,
if
need
be
,
to
reprobate
any
attempt
at
familiarity
from
those
whose
worldly
circumstances
were
supposed
to
be
disadvantageous
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
aunt
,
"
said
Kate
one
morning
after
their
walk
upon
the
pier
,
"
how
you
did
snub
that
Captain
Bellfield
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Captain
Bellfield
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
I
do
n't
believe
he
's
a
captain
at
all
.
<EOS>
At
any
rate
he
has
sold
out
,
and
the
tradesmen
have
had
a
scramble
for
the
money
.
<EOS>
He
was
only
a
lieutenant
when
the
97th
were
in
Manchester
,
and
I
'm
sure
he
's
never
had
a
shilling
to
purchase
since
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
everybody
here
seems
to
know
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
they
do
not
know
so
much
of
him
as
I
do
.
<EOS>
The
idea
of
his
having
the
impudence
to
tell
me
I
was
looking
very
well
!
<EOS>
Nothing
can
be
so
mean
as
men
who
go
about
in
that
way
when
they
have
n't
money
enough
in
their
pockets
to
pay
their
washerwomen
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
But
how
do
you
know
,
aunt
,
that
Captain
Bellfield
has
n't
paid
his
washerwoman
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
more
than
you
think
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
It
's
my
business
.
<EOS>
How
could
I
tell
whose
attentions
you
should
receive
and
whose
you
should
n't
,
if
I
did
n't
inquire
into
these
things
?
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
in
vain
that
Kate
rebelled
,
or
attempted
to
rebel
against
this
more
than
maternal
care
.
<EOS>
She
told
her
aunt
that
she
was
now
nearly
thirty
,
and
that
she
had
managed
her
own
affairs
,
at
any
rate
with
safety
,
for
the
last
ten
years
;
 
but
it
was
to
no
purpose
.
<EOS>
Kate
would
get
angry
;
but
Mrs.
Greenow
never
became
angry
.
<EOS>
Kate
would
be
quite
in
earnest
;
but
Mrs.
Greenow
would
push
aside
all
that
her
niece
said
as
though
it
were
worth
nothing
.
<EOS>
Kate
was
an
unmarried
woman
with
a
very
small
fortune
,
and
therefore
,
of
course
,
was
desirous
of
being
married
with
as
little
delay
as
possible
.
<EOS>
It
was
natural
that
she
should
deny
that
it
was
so
,
especially
at
this
early
date
in
their
mutual
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
When
the
niece
came
to
know
her
aunt
more
intimately
,
there
might
be
confidence
between
them
,
and
then
they
would
do
better
.
<EOS>
But
Mrs.
Greenow
would
spare
neither
herself
nor
her
purse
on
Kate
's
behalf
,
and
she
would
be
a
dragon
of
watchfulness
in
protecting
her
from
the
evil
desires
of
such
useless
men
as
Captain
Bellfield
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
declare
,
<EOS>
Kate
,
I
do
n't
understand
you
,
"
she
said
one
morning
to
her
niece
as
they
sat
together
over
a
late
breakfast
.
<EOS>
They
had
fallen
into
luxurious
habits
,
and
I
am
afraid
it
was
past
eleven
o'clock
,
although
the
breakfast
things
were
still
on
the
table
.
<EOS>
Kate
would
usually
bathe
before
breakfast
,
but
Mrs.
Greenow
was
never
out
of
her
room
till
half
-
past
ten
.
<EOS>
"
I
like
the
morning
for
contemplation
,
"
she
once
said
.
<EOS>
"
When
a
woman
has
gone
through
all
that
I
have
suffered
<EOS>
she
has
a
great
deal
to
think
of
.
"
<EOS>
"
And
it
is
so
much
more
comfortable
to
be
a
-
thinking
when
one
's
in
bed
,
"
said
Jeannette
,
who
was
present
at
the
time
.
<EOS>
"
Child
,
hold
your
tongue
,
"
said
the
widow
.
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
ma'am
,
"
said
Jeannette
.
<EOS>
But
we
'll
return
to
the
scene
at
the
breakfast
-
table
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
n't
you
understand
,
aunt
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
only
danced
twice
last
night
,
and
once
you
stood
up
with
Captain
Bellfield
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
On
purpose
to
ask
after
that
poor
woman
who
washes
his
clothes
without
getting
paid
for
it
.
"
  
"
Nonsense
,
Kate
;
you
did
n't
ask
him
anything
of
the
kind
,
I
'm
sure
.
<EOS>
It
's
very
provoking
.
<EOS>
It
is
indeed
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
But
what
harm
can
Captain
Bellfield
do
me
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
good
can
he
do
you
?
<EOS>
That
's
the
question
.
<EOS>
You
see
,
my
dear
,
years
will
go
by
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
mean
to
say
you
ai
n't
quite
as
young
as
ever
you
were
,
and
nothing
can
be
nicer
and
fresher
than
you
are
;
 
especially
since
you
took
to
bathing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
aunt
,
do
n't
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
the
truth
must
be
spoken
.
<EOS>
I
declare
I
do
n't
think
I
ever
saw
a
young
woman
so
improvident
as
you
are
.
<EOS>
When
are
you
to
begin
to
think
about
getting
married
if
you
do
n't
do
it
now
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
never
begin
to
think
about
it
,
till
I
buy
my
wedding
clothes
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
nonsense
,
 
sheer
nonsense
.
<EOS>
How
are
you
to
get
wedding
clothes
if
you
have
never
thought
about
getting
a
husband
?
<EOS>
Did
n't
I
see
Mr.
Cheesacre
ask
you
for
a
dance
last
night
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
he
did
;
while
you
were
talking
to
Captain
Bellfield
yourself
,
aunt
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Captain
Bellfield
ca
n't
hurt
me
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
And
why
did
n't
you
dance
with
Mr.
Cheesacre
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
's
a
fat
Norfolk
farmer
,
with
not
an
idea
beyond
the
virtues
of
stall
-
feeding
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
every
acre
of
it
is
his
own
land
,
 
every
acre
!
<EOS>
And
he
bought
another
farm
for
thirteen
thousand
pounds
only
last
autumn
.
<EOS>
They
're
better
than
the
squires
,
 
some
of
those
gentlemen
farmers
;
they
are
indeed
.
<EOS>
And
of
all
men
in
the
world
they
're
the
easiest
managed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
a
recommendation
,
no
doubt
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
it
is
;
 
a
great
recommendation
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Greenow
had
no
idea
of
joking
when
her
mind
was
intent
on
serious
things
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
's
to
take
us
to
the
picnic
to
-
morrow
,
and
I
do
hope
you
'll
manage
to
let
him
sit
beside
you
.
<EOS>
It
'll
be
the
place
of
honour
,
because
he
gives
all
the
wine
.
<EOS>
He
's
picked
up
with
that
man
Bellfield
,
and
he
's
to
be
there
;
but
if
you
allow
your
name
to
be
once
mixed
up
with
his
,
it
will
be
all
over
with
you
as
far
as
Yarmouth
is
concerned
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
at
all
want
to
be
mixed
up
with
Captain
Bellfield
,
as
you
call
it
,
"
said
Kate
.
<EOS>
Then
she
subsided
into
her
novel
,
while
Mrs.
Greenow
busied
herself
about
the
good
things
for
the
picnic
.
<EOS>
In
truth
,
the
aunt
did
not
understand
the
niece
.
<EOS>
Whatsoever
might
be
the
faults
of
Kate
Vavasor
,
an
unmaidenly
desire
of
catching
a
husband
for
herself
was
certainly
not
one
of
them
.
   
<EOS>
Mr.
Cheesacre
.
 
<EOS>
Yarmouth
is
not
a
happy
place
for
a
picnic
.
<EOS>
A
picnic
should
be
held
among
green
things
.
<EOS>
Green
turf
is
absolutely
an
essential
.
<EOS>
There
should
be
trees
,
broken
ground
,
small
paths
,
thickets
,
and
hidden
recesses
.
<EOS>
There
should
,
if
possible
,
be
rocks
,
old
timber
,
moss
,
and
brambles
.
<EOS>
There
should
certainly
be
hills
and
dales
,
 
on
a
small
scale
;
and
above
all
,
there
should
be
running
water
.
<EOS>
There
should
be
no
expanse
.
<EOS>
Jones
should
not
be
able
to
see
all
Greene
's
movements
,
nor
should
Augusta
always
have
her
eye
upon
her
sister
Jane
.
<EOS>
But
the
spot
chosen
for
Mr.
Cheesacre
's
picnic
at
Yarmouth
had
none
of
the
virtues
above
described
.
<EOS>
It
was
on
the
seashore
.
<EOS>
Nothing
was
visible
from
the
site
but
sand
and
sea
.
<EOS>
There
were
no
trees
there
and
nothing
green
;
 
neither
was
there
any
running
water
.
<EOS>
But
there
was
a
long
,
dry
,
flat
strand
;
there
was
an
old
boat
half
turned
over
,
under
which
it
was
proposed
to
dine
;
and
in
addition
to
this
,
benches
,
boards
,
and
some
amount
of
canvas
for
shelter
were
provided
by
the
liberality
of
Mr.
Cheesacre
.
<EOS>
Therefore
it
was
called
Mr.
Cheesacre
's
picnic
.
  
<EOS>
But
it
was
to
be
a
marine
picnic
,
and
therefore
the
essential
attributes
of
other
picnics
were
not
required
.
<EOS>
The
idea
had
come
from
some
boating
expeditions
,
in
which
mackerel
had
been
caught
,
and
during
which
food
had
been
eaten
,
not
altogether
comfortably
,
in
the
boats
.
<EOS>
Then
a
thought
had
suggested
itself
to
Captain
Bellfield
that
they
might
land
and
eat
their
food
,
and
his
friend
Mr.
Cheesacre
had
promised
his
substantial
aid
.
<EOS>
A
lady
had
surmised
that
Ormesby
sands
would
be
the
very
place
for
dancing
in
the
cool
of
the
evening
.
<EOS>
They
might
"
Dance
on
the
sand
,
"
she
said
,
"
and
yet
no
footing
seen
.
"
<EOS>
And
so
the
thing
had
progressed
,
and
the
picnic
been
inaugurated
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
Mr.
Cheesacre
's
picnic
undoubtedly
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Cheesacre
was
to
supply
the
boats
,
the
wine
,
the
cigars
,
the
music
,
and
the
carpenter
's
work
necessary
for
the
turning
of
the
old
boat
into
a
banqueting
saloon
.
<EOS>
But
Mrs.
Greenow
had
promised
to
provide
the
eatables
,
and
enjoyed
as
much
of
the
_
éclat
_
as
the
master
of
the
festival
.
<EOS>
She
had
known
Mr.
Cheesacre
now
for
ten
days
and
was
quite
intimate
with
him
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
stout
,
florid
man
,
of
about
forty
-
five
,
a
bachelor
,
apparently
much
attached
to
ladies
"
society
,
bearing
no
sign
of
age
except
that
he
was
rather
bald
,
and
that
grey
hairs
had
mixed
themselves
with
his
whiskers
,
very
fond
of
his
farming
,
and
yet
somewhat
ashamed
of
it
when
he
found
himself
in
what
he
considered
to
be
polite
circles
.
<EOS>
And
he
was
,
moreover
,
a
little
inclined
to
seek
the
honour
which
comes
from
a
well
-
filled
and
liberally
-
opened
purse
.
<EOS>
He
liked
to
give
a
man
a
dinner
and
then
to
boast
of
the
dinner
he
had
given
.
<EOS>
He
was
very
proud
when
he
could
talk
of
having
mounted
,
for
a
day
's
hunting
,
any
man
who
might
be
supposed
to
be
of
higher
rank
than
himself
.
<EOS>
"
I
had
Grimsby
with
me
the
other
day
,
 
the
son
of
old
Grimsby
of
Hatherwick
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
Blessed
if
he
did
n't
stake
my
bay
mare
.
<EOS>
But
what
matters
?
<EOS>
I
mounted
him
again
the
next
day
just
the
same
.
<EOS>
"
Some
people
thought
he
was
soft
,
for
it
was
very
well
known
throughout
Norfolk
that
young
Grimsby
would
take
a
mount
wherever
he
could
get
it
.
<EOS>
In
these
days
Mrs.
Greenow
had
become
intimate
with
Mr.
Cheesacre
,
and
had
already
learned
that
he
was
the
undoubted
owner
of
his
own
acres
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
would
n't
do
for
me
,
"
she
had
said
to
him
,
"
to
be
putting
myself
forward
,
as
if
I
were
giving
a
party
myself
,
or
anything
of
that
sort
;
 
would
it
now
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
perhaps
not
.
<EOS>
But
you
might
come
with
us
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
So
I
will
,
Mr.
Cheesacre
,
for
that
dear
girl
's
sake
.
<EOS>
I
should
never
forgive
myself
if
I
debarred
her
from
all
the
pleasures
of
youth
,
because
of
my
sorrows
.
<EOS>
I
need
hardly
say
that
at
such
a
time
as
this
nothing
of
that
sort
can
give
me
any
pleasure
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
not
,
"
said
Mr.
Cheesacre
,
with
solemn
look
.
  
<EOS>
"
Quite
out
of
the
question
.
"
And
Mrs.
Greenow
wiped
away
her
tears
.
<EOS>
"
For
though
as
regards
age
I
might
dance
on
the
sands
as
merrily
as
the
best
of
them
 
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
I
'm
sure
you
could
,
Mrs.
Greenow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
's
a
woman
to
enjoy
herself
if
her
heart
lies
buried
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
it
wo
n't
be
<EOS>
so
always
,
Mrs.
Greenow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Greenow
shook
her
head
to
show
that
she
hardly
knew
how
to
answer
such
a
question
.
<EOS>
Probably
it
would
be
so
always
;
 
but
she
did
not
wish
to
put
a
damper
on
the
present
occasion
by
making
so
sad
a
declaration
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
as
I
was
saying
,
"
continued
she
 
<EOS>
"
if
you
and
I
do
it
between
us
wo
n't
that
be
the
surest
way
of
having
it
come
off
nicely
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Cheesacre
thought
that
it
would
be
the
best
way
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Exactly
so
;
 
I
'll
do
the
meat
and
pastry
and
fruit
,
and
you
shall
do
the
boats
and
the
wine
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
the
music
,
"
said
Cheesacre
,
"
and
the
expenses
at
the
place
.
<EOS>
"
He
did
not
choose
that
any
part
of
his
outlay
should
go
unnoticed
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
go
halves
in
all
that
if
you
like
,
"
said
Mrs.
Greenow
.
<EOS>
But
Mr.
Cheesacre
had
declined
this
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
begrudge
the
expense
,
but
only
wished
that
it
should
be
recognised
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
,
Mr.
Cheesacre
,
"
continued
Mrs.
Greenow
.
<EOS>
"
I
did
mean
to
send
the
music
;
I
did
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
could
n't
hear
of
it
,
Mrs.
Greenow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
mention
it
now
,
because
I
was
thinking
of
getting
Blowehard
to
come
.
<EOS>
That
other
man
,
Flutey
,
would
n't
do
at
all
out
in
the
open
air
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
shall
be
Blowehard
,
"
said
Mr.
Cheesacre
;
and
it
was
Blowehard
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Greenow
liked
to
have
her
own
way
in
these
little
things
,
though
her
heart
did
lie
buried
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
morning
of
the
picnic
Mr.
Cheesacre
came
down
to
Montpelier
Parade
with
Captain
Bellfield
,
whose
linen
on
that
occasion
certainly
gave
no
outward
sign
of
any
quarrel
between
him
and
his
washerwoman
.
<EOS>
He
was
got
up
wonderfully
,
and
was
prepared
at
all
points
for
the
day
's
work
.
<EOS>
He
had
on
a
pseudo
-
sailor
's
jacket
,
very
liberally
ornamented
with
brass
buttons
,
which
displayed
with
great
judgement
the
exquisite
shapes
of
his
pseudo
-
sailor
's
duck
trousers
.
<EOS>
Beneath
them
there
was
a
pair
of
very
shiny
patent
-
leather
shoes
,
well
adapted
for
dancing
on
the
sand
,
presuming
him
to
be
anxious
of
doing
so
,
as
Venus
offered
to
do
,
without
leaving
any
footmarks
.
<EOS>
His
waistcoat
was
of
a
delicate
white
fabric
,
ornamented
with
very
many
gilt
buttons
.
<EOS>
He
had
bejewelled
studs
in
his
shirt
,
and
yellow
kid
gloves
on
his
hands
;
having
,
of
course
,
another
pair
in
his
pocket
for
the
necessities
of
the
evening
.
<EOS>
His
array
was
quite
perfect
,
and
had
stricken
dismay
into
the
heart
of
his
friend
Cheesacre
,
when
he
joined
that
gentleman
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
well
-
made
man
,
nearly
six
feet
high
,
with
dark
hair
,
dark
whiskers
,
and
dark
moustache
,
nearly
black
,
but
of
that
suspicious
hue
which
to
the
observant
beholder
seems
always
to
tell
a
tale
of
the
hairdresser
's
shop
.
<EOS>
He
was
handsome
,
too
,
with
well
-
arranged
features
,
 
but
carrying
,
perhaps
,
in
his
nose
some
first
symptoms
of
the
effects
of
midnight
amusements
.
<EOS>
Upon
the
whole
,
however
,
he
was
a
nice
man
to
look
at
 
for
those
who
like
to
look
on
nice
men
of
that
kind
.
  
<EOS>
Cheesacre
,
too
,
had
adopted
something
of
a
sailor
's
garb
.
<EOS>
He
had
on
a
jacket
of
a
rougher
sort
,
coming
down
much
lower
than
that
of
the
captain
,
being
much
looser
,
and
perhaps
somewhat
more
like
a
garment
which
a
possible
seaman
might
possibly
wear
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
disgusted
with
himself
the
moment
that
he
saw
Bellfield
.
<EOS>
His
heart
had
been
faint
,
and
he
had
not
dared
to
ornament
himself
boldly
as
his
friend
had
done
.
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
Guss
,
you
are
a
swell
,
"
he
exclaimed
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
explained
that
Captain
Bellfield
had
been
christened
Gustavus
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
much
about
that
,
"
said
the
captain
;
"
my
fellow
sent
me
this
toggery
,
and
said
that
it
was
the
sort
of
thing
.
<EOS>
I
'll
change
with
you
if
you
like
it
.
"
<EOS>
But
Cheesacre
could
not
have
worn
that
jacket
,
and
he
walked
on
,
hating
himself
.
  
<EOS>
It
will
be
remembered
that
Mrs.
Greenow
had
spoken
with
considerable
severity
of
Captain
Bellfield
's
pretensions
when
discussing
his
character
with
her
niece
;
but
,
nevertheless
,
on
the
present
occasion
she
received
him
with
most
gracious
smiles
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
that
her
estimate
of
his
character
had
been
altered
,
or
that
she
was
making
sacrifice
of
her
own
feelings
in
consideration
of
Mr.
Cheesacre
,
who
was
known
to
be
the
captain
's
intimate
friend
.
<EOS>
But
she
had
smiles
for
both
of
them
.
<EOS>
She
had
a
wondrous
power
of
smiling
;
and
could
,
upon
occasion
,
give
signs
of
peculiar
favour
to
half
a
dozen
different
gentlemen
in
as
many
minutes
.
<EOS>
They
found
her
in
the
midst
of
hampers
which
were
not
yet
wholly
packed
,
while
Mrs.
Jones
,
Jeannette
,
and
the
cook
of
the
household
moved
around
her
,
on
the
outside
of
the
circle
,
ministering
to
her
wants
.
<EOS>
She
had
in
her
hand
an
outspread
clean
napkin
,
and
she
wore
fastened
round
her
dress
a
huge
coarse
apron
,
that
she
might
thus
be
protected
from
some
possible
ebullition
of
gravy
,
or
escape
of
salad
mixture
,
or
cream
;
but
in
other
respects
she
was
clothed
in
the
fullest
honours
of
widowhood
.
<EOS>
She
had
not
mitigated
her
weeds
by
half
an
inch
.
<EOS>
She
had
scorned
to
make
any
compromise
between
the
world
of
pleasure
and
the
world
of
woe
.
<EOS>
There
she
was
,
a
widow
,
declared
by
herself
to
be
of
four
months
"
standing
,
with
a
buried
heart
,
making
ready
a
dainty
banquet
with
skill
and
liberality
.
<EOS>
She
was
ready
on
the
instant
to
sit
down
upon
the
baskets
in
which
the
grouse
pie
had
been
just
carefully
inhumed
,
and
talked
about
her
sainted
lamb
with
a
deluge
of
tears
.
<EOS>
If
anybody
did
n't
like
it
,
that
person
 
might
do
the
other
thing
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Cheesacre
and
Captain
Bellfield
thought
that
they
did
like
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
Mr.
Cheesacre
,
if
you
have
n't
caught
me
before
I
've
half
done
!
<EOS>
Captain
Bellfield
,
I
hope
you
think
my
apron
becoming
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Everything
that
you
wear
,
Mrs.
Greenow
,
is
always
becoming
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
n't
talk
in
that
way
when
you
know
 
;
but
never
mind
 
we
will
think
of
nothing
sad
to
-
day
if
we
can
help
it
.
<EOS>
Will
we
,
Mr.
Cheesacre
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
dear
<EOS>
no
<EOS>
;
I
should
think
not
;
 
unless
it
should
come
on
to
rain
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
wo
n't
rain
 
we
wo
n't
think
of
such
a
thing
.
<EOS>
But
,
by
the
by
,
Captain
Bellfield
,
I
and
my
niece
do
mean
to
send
out
a
few
things
,
just
in
a
bag
you
know
,
so
that
we
may
tidy
ourselves
up
a
little
after
the
sea
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
want
it
mentioned
,
because
if
it
gets
about
among
the
other
ladies
,
they
'd
think
we
wanted
to
make
a
dressing
of
it
;
 
and
there
would
n't
be
room
for
them
all
;
would
there
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
there
would
n't
,
"
said
Mr.
Cheesacre
,
who
had
been
out
on
the
previous
evening
,
inspecting
,
and
perhaps
limiting
,
the
carpenters
in
their
work
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
just
it
,
"
said
Mrs.
Greenow
.
<EOS>
"
But
there
wo
n't
be
any
harm
,
will
there
,
<EOS>
Mr.
Cheesacre
,
in
Jeanette
's
going
out
with
our
things
?
<EOS>
She
'll
ride
in
the
cart
,
you
know
,
with
the
eatables
.
<EOS>
I
know
Jeannette
's
a
friend
of
yours
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
shall
be
delighted
to
have
Jeanette
,
"
said
Mr.
Cheesacre
.
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
ye
,
sir
,
"
said
Jeannette
,
with
a
curtsey
.
  
<EOS>
"
Jeannette
,
do
n't
you
let
Mr.
Cheesacre
turn
your
head
;
and
mind
you
behave
yourself
and
be
useful
.
<EOS>
Well
;
let
me
see
;
 
what
else
is
there
?
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jones
,
you
might
as
well
give
me
that
ham
now
.
<EOS>
Captain
Bellfield
,
hand
it
over
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
put
it
into
the
basket
,
because
you
'd
turn
it
the
wrong
side
down
.
<EOS>
There
now
,
if
you
have
n't
nearly
made
me
upset
the
apricot
pie
.
"
<EOS>
Then
,
in
the
transfer
of
the
dishes
between
the
captain
and
the
widow
,
there
occurred
some
little
innocent
by
-
play
,
which
seemed
to
give
offence
to
Mr.
Cheesacre
;
so
that
that
gentleman
turned
his
back
upon
the
hampers
and
took
a
step
away
towards
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Greenow
saw
the
thing
at
a
glance
,
and
immediately
applied
herself
to
cure
the
wound
.
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
think
,
Mr.
Cheesacre
,
"
said
she
,
"
Kate
would
n't
come
down
because
she
did
n't
choose
that
you
should
see
her
with
an
apron
on
over
her
frock
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
sure
I
do
n't
know
why
Miss
Vavasor
should
care
about
my
seeing
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Nor
I
either
.
<EOS>
That
's
just
what
I
said
.
<EOS>
Do
step
up
into
the
drawing
-
room
;
you
'll
find
her
there
,
and
you
can
make
her
answer
for
herself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
would
n't
come
down
for
me
,
"
said
Mr.
Cheesacre
.
<EOS>
But
he
did
n't
stir
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
he
was
n't
willing
to
leave
his
friend
with
the
widow
.
  
<EOS>
At
length
the
last
of
the
dishes
was
packed
and
Mrs.
Greenow
went
up
-
stairs
with
the
two
gentlemen
.
<EOS>
There
they
found
Kate
and
two
or
three
other
ladies
who
had
promised
to
embark
under
the
protection
of
Mrs.
Greenow
's
wings
.
<EOS>
There
were
the
two
Miss
Fairstairs
,
whom
Mrs.
Greenow
had
especially
patronized
,
and
who
repaid
that
lady
for
her
kindness
by
an
amount
of
outspoken
eulogy
which
startled
Kate
by
its
audacity
.
  
<EOS>
"
Your
dear
aunt
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Fanny
Fairstairs
had
said
on
coming
into
the
room
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
I
ever
came
across
a
woman
with
such
genuine
milk
of
human
kindness
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nor
with
so
much
true
wit
,
"
said
her
sister
Charlotte
,
 
who
had
been
called
Charlie
on
the
sands
of
Yarmouth
for
the
last
twelve
years
.
  
<EOS>
When
the
widow
came
into
the
room
,
they
flew
at
her
and
devoured
her
with
kisses
,
and
swore
that
they
had
never
seen
her
looking
so
well
.
<EOS>
But
as
the
bright
new
gloves
which
both
the
girls
wore
had
been
presents
from
Mrs.
Greenow
,
they
certainly
did
owe
her
some
affection
.
<EOS>
There
are
not
many
ladies
who
would
venture
to
bestow
such
gifts
upon
their
friends
after
so
very
short
an
acquaintance
;
but
Mrs.
Greenow
had
a
power
that
was
quite
her
own
in
such
matters
.
<EOS>
She
was
already
on
a
very
confidential
footing
with
the
Miss
Fairstairs
,
and
had
given
them
much
useful
advice
as
to
their
future
prospects
.
  
<EOS>
And
then
was
there
a
Mrs.
Green
,
whose
husband
was
first
-
lieutenant
on
board
a
man
-
of
-
war
on
the
West
Indian
Station
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Green
was
a
quiet
,
ladylike
little
woman
,
rather
pretty
,
very
silent
,
and
,
as
one
would
have
thought
,
hardly
adapted
for
the
special
intimacy
of
Mrs.
Greenow
.
<EOS>
But
Mrs.
Greenow
had
found
out
that
she
was
alone
,
not
very
rich
,
and
in
want
of
the
solace
of
society
.
<EOS>
Therefore
she
had
,
from
sheer
good
-
nature
,
forced
herself
upon
Mrs.
Green
,
and
<EOS>
Mrs.
Green
,
with
much
trepidation
,
had
consented
to
be
taken
to
the
picnic
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
your
husband
would
like
it
,
"
Mrs.
Greenow
had
said
,
"
<EOS>
and
I
hope
I
may
live
to
tell
him
that
I
made
you
go
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
came
in
also
a
brother
of
the
Fairstairs
girls
,
Joe
Fairstairs
,
a
lanky
,
useless
,
idle
young
man
,
younger
than
them
,
who
was
supposed
to
earn
his
bread
in
an
attorney
's
office
at
Norwich
,
or
rather
to
be
preparing
to
earn
it
at
some
future
time
,
and
who
was
a
heavy
burden
upon
all
his
friends
.
<EOS>
"
We
told
Joe
to
come
to
the
house
,
"
said
Fanny
to
the
widow
,
apologetically
,
"
because
we
thought
he
might
be
useful
in
carrying
down
the
cloaks
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Greenow
smiled
graciously
upon
Joe
,
and
assured
him
that
she
was
charmed
to
see
him
,
without
any
reference
to
such
services
as
those
mentioned
.
  
<EOS>
And
then
they
started
.
<EOS>
When
they
got
to
the
door
both
Cheesacre
and
the
captain
made
an
attempt
to
get
possession
of
the
widow
's
arm
.
<EOS>
But
she
had
it
all
arranged
.
<EOS>
Captain
Bellfield
found
himself
constrained
to
attend
to
Mrs.
Green
,
while
Mr.
Cheesacre
walked
down
to
the
beach
beside
Kate
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
take
your
arm
,
Mr.
Joe
,
"
said
the
widow
,
"
and
the
girls
shall
come
with
us
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
when
they
got
to
the
boats
,
round
which
the
other
comers
to
the
picnic
were
already
assembled
,
Mr.
Cheesacre
,
 
although
both
the
boats
were
for
the
day
his
own
,
 
found
himself
separated
from
the
widow
.
<EOS>
He
got
into
that
which
contained
Kate
Vavasor
,
and
was
shoved
off
from
the
beach
while
he
saw
Captain
Bellfield
arranging
Mrs.
Greenow
's
drapery
.
<EOS>
He
had
declared
to
himself
that
it
should
be
otherwise
;
and
that
as
he
had
to
pay
the
piper
,
the
piper
should
play
as
he
liked
it
.
<EOS>
But
Mrs.
Greenow
with
a
word
or
two
had
settled
it
all
,
and
Mr.
Cheesacre
had
found
himself
to
be
powerless
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
How
absurd
Bellfield
looks
in
that
jacket
,
does
n't
he
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
to
Kate
,
as
he
took
his
seat
in
the
boat
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
think
so
?
<EOS>
I
thought
it
was
so
very
pretty
and
becoming
for
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Cheesacre
hated
Captain
Bellfield
,
and
regretted
more
than
ever
that
he
had
not
done
something
for
his
own
personal
adornment
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
endure
to
think
that
his
friend
,
who
paid
for
nothing
,
should
carry
away
the
honours
of
the
morning
and
defraud
him
of
the
delights
which
should
justly
belong
to
him
,
"
It
may
be
becoming
,
"
said
Cheesacre
;
"
but
do
n't
you
think
it
's
awfully
extravagant
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
As
to
that
I
ca
n't
tell
.
<EOS>
You
see
I
do
n't
at
all
know
what
is
the
price
of
a
jacket
covered
all
over
with
little
brass
buttons
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
the
waistcoat
,
Miss
Vavasor
!
"
said
Cheesacre
,
almost
solemnly
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
waistcoat
I
should
think
must
have
been
expensive
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
dreadful
!
<EOS>
and
he
's
got
nothing
,
Miss
Vavasor
;
literally
nothing
.
<EOS>
Do
you
know
,
"
 
<EOS>
and
he
reduced
his
voice
to
a
whisper
as
he
made
this
communication
,
 
<EOS>
"
I
lent
him
twenty
pounds
the
day
before
yesterday
;
I
did
indeed
.
<EOS>
You
wo
n't
mention
it
again
,
of
course
.
<EOS>
I
tell
you
,
because
,
as
you
are
seeing
a
good
deal
of
him
just
now
,
I
think
it
right
that
you
should
know
on
what
sort
of
a
footing
he
stands
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
all
fair
,
they
say
,
in
love
and
war
,
and
this
small
breach
of
confidence
was
,
we
must
presume
,
a
love
stratagem
on
the
part
of
Mr.
Cheesacre
.
<EOS>
He
was
at
this
time
smitten
with
the
charms
both
of
the
widow
and
of
the
niece
,
and
he
constantly
found
that
the
captain
was
interfering
with
him
on
whichever
side
he
turned
himself
.
<EOS>
On
the
present
occasion
he
had
desired
to
take
the
widow
for
his
share
,
and
was
,
upon
the
whole
,
inclined
to
think
that
the
widow
was
the
more
worthy
of
his
attentions
.
<EOS>
He
had
made
certain
little
inquiries
within
the
last
day
or
two
,
the
answers
to
which
had
been
satisfactory
.
<EOS>
These
he
had
by
no
means
communicated
to
his
friend
,
to
whom
,
indeed
,
he
had
expressed
an
opinion
that
Mrs.
Greenow
was
after
all
only
a
flash
in
the
pan
.
<EOS>
"
She
does
very
well
pour
passer
le
temps
,
"
the
captain
had
answered
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Cheesacre
had
not
quite
understood
the
exact
gist
of
the
captain
's
meaning
,
but
had
felt
certain
that
his
friend
was
playing
him
false
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
want
it
to
be
mentioned
again
,
Miss
Vavasor
,
"
he
continued
.
  
<EOS>
"
Such
things
should
not
be
mentioned
at
all
,
"
Kate
replied
,
having
been
angered
at
the
insinuation
that
the
nature
of
Captain
Bellfield
's
footing
could
be
a
matter
of
any
moment
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
they
should
n't
;
and
therefore
I
know
that
I
'm
quite
safe
with
you
,
Miss
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
He
's
a
very
pleasant
fellow
,
very
;
and
has
seen
the
world
,
 
uncommon
;
but
he
's
better
for
eating
and
drinking
with
than
he
is
for
buying
and
selling
with
,
as
we
say
in
Norfolk
.
<EOS>
Do
you
like
Norfolk
,
Miss
Vavasor
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
was
in
it
before
,
and
now
I
've
only
seen
Yarmouth
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
nice
place
,
Yarmouth
,
very
;
but
you
should
come
up
and
see
our
lands
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
you
do
n't
know
that
we
feed
one
-
third
of
England
during
the
winter
months
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Dear
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
do
,
though
;
nobody
knows
what
a
county
Norfolk
is
.
<EOS>
Taking
it
altogether
,
including
the
game
you
know
,
and
Lord
Nelson
,
and
its
watering
-
places
and
the
rest
of
it
,
I
do
n't
think
there
's
a
county
in
England
to
beat
it
.
<EOS>
Fancy
feeding
one
-
third
of
all
England
and
Wales
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
With
bread
and
cheese
,
do
you
mean
,
and
those
sort
of
things
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Beef
!
"
said
Mr.
Cheesacre
,
and
in
his
patriotic
energy
he
repeated
the
word
aloud
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Beef
!
<EOS>
Yes
indeed
;
but
if
you
were
to
tell
them
that
in
London
they
would
n't
believe
you
.
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
you
should
certainly
come
down
and
see
our
lands
.
<EOS>
The
7.45
A.M.
train
would
take
you
through
Norwich
to
my
door
,
as
one
may
say
,
and
you
would
be
back
by
the
6.22
P.M.
<EOS>
"
In
this
way
he
brought
himself
back
again
into
good
-
humour
,
feeling
,
that
in
the
absence
of
the
widow
,
he
could
not
do
better
than
make
progress
with
the
niece
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
mean
time
Mrs.
Greenow
and
the
captain
were
getting
on
very
comfortably
in
the
other
boat
.
<EOS>
"
Take
an
oar
,
Captain
,
"
one
of
the
men
had
said
to
him
as
soon
as
he
had
placed
the
ladies
.
"
<EOS>
Not
to
-
day
,
Jack
,
"
he
had
answered
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
content
myself
with
being
bo'san
this
morning
.
"
<EOS>
"
The
best
thing
as
the
bo'san
does
is
to
pipe
all
hands
to
grog
,
"
said
the
man
.
<EOS>
"
I
wo
n't
be
behind
in
that
either
,
"
said
the
captain
;
and
so
they
all
went
on
swimmingly
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
a
fine
generous
fellow
your
friend
,
Mr.
Cheesacre
,
is
!
"
said
the
widow
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
he
is
;
he
's
a
capital
fellow
in
his
way
.
<EOS>
Some
of
these
Norfolk
farmers
are
no
end
of
good
fellows
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
suppose
he
's
something
more
than
a
common
farmer
.
<EOS>
He
's
visited
by
the
people
about
where
he
lives
,
is
n't
he
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
yes
,
in
a
sort
of
a
way
.
<EOS>
The
county
people
,
you
know
,
keep
themselves
very
much
to
themselves
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
of
course
.
<EOS>
But
his
house
;
 
he
has
a
good
sort
of
place
,
has
n't
he
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
yes
;
 
a
very
good
house
;
 
a
little
too
near
to
the
horse
-
pond
for
my
taste
.
<EOS>
But
when
a
man
gets
his
money
out
of
the
till
,
he
must
n't
be
ashamed
of
the
counter
;
 
must
he
,
Mrs.
Greenow
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
he
could
live
like
a
gentleman
if
he
let
his
own
land
,
could
n't
he
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
depends
upon
how
a
gentleman
wishes
to
live
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Here
the
privacy
of
their
conversation
was
interrupted
by
an
exclamation
from
a
young
lady
to
the
effect
that
Charlie
Fairstairs
was
becoming
sick
.
<EOS>
This
Charlie
stoutly
denied
,
and
proved
the
truth
of
her
assertion
by
her
behaviour
.
<EOS>
Soon
after
this
they
completed
their
marine
adventures
,
and
prepared
to
land
close
to
the
spot
at
which
the
banquet
was
prepared
.
   
<EOS>
The
Rivals
.
 
<EOS>
There
had
been
a
pretence
of
fishing
,
but
no
fish
had
been
caught
.
<EOS>
It
was
soon
found
that
such
an
amusement
would
interfere
with
the
ladies
"
dresses
,
and
the
affairs
had
become
too
serious
to
allow
of
any
trivial
interruption
.
<EOS>
"
I
really
think
,
Mr.
Cheesacre
,
"
an
anxious
mother
had
said
,
"
that
you
'd
better
give
it
up
.
<EOS>
The
water
off
the
nasty
cord
has
got
all
over
Maria
's
dress
,
already
.
<EOS>
"
Maria
made
a
faint
protest
that
it
did
not
signify
in
the
least
;
but
the
fishing
was
given
up
,
 
not
without
an
inward
feeling
on
the
part
of
Mr.
Cheesacre
that
if
Maria
chose
to
come
out
with
him
in
his
boat
,
having
been
invited
especially
to
fish
,
she
ought
to
have
put
up
with
the
natural
results
.
<EOS>
"
There
are
people
who
like
to
take
everything
and
never
like
to
give
anything
,
"
he
said
to
Kate
afterwards
,
as
he
was
walking
up
with
her
to
the
picnic
dinner
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
unreasonable
and
unjust
.
<EOS>
The
girls
had
graced
his
party
with
their
best
hats
and
freshest
muslins
,
not
that
they
might
see
him
catch
a
mackerel
,
but
that
they
might
flirt
and
dance
to
the
best
advantage
.
<EOS>
"
You
ca
n't
suppose
that
any
girl
will
like
to
be
drenched
with
sea
-
water
when
she
has
taken
so
much
trouble
with
her
starch
,
"
said
Kate
.
<EOS>
"
Then
she
should
n't
come
fishing
,
"
said
Mr.
Cheesacre
.
<EOS>
"
I
hate
such
airs
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
But
when
they
arrived
at
the
old
boat
,
Mrs.
Greenow
shone
forth
pre
-
eminently
as
the
mistress
of
the
occasion
,
altogether
overshadowing
Mr.
Cheesacre
by
the
extent
of
her
authority
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
little
contest
for
supremacy
between
them
,
invisible
to
the
eyes
of
the
multitude
;
but
Mr.
Cheesacre
in
such
a
matter
had
not
a
chance
against
Mrs.
Greenow
.
<EOS>
I
am
disposed
to
think
that
she
would
have
reigned
even
though
she
had
not
contributed
to
the
eatables
;
but
with
that
point
in
her
favour
,
she
was
able
to
make
herself
supreme
.
<EOS>
Jeannette
,
too
,
was
her
servant
,
which
was
a
great
thing
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Cheesacre
soon
gave
way
;
and
though
he
bustled
about
and
was
conspicuous
,
he
bustled
about
in
obedience
to
orders
received
,
and
became
a
head
servant
.
<EOS>
Captain
Bellfield
also
made
himself
useful
,
but
he
drove
Mr.
Cheesacre
into
paroxysms
of
suppressed
anger
by
giving
directions
,
and
by
having
those
directions
obeyed
.
<EOS>
A
man
to
whom
he
had
lent
twenty
pounds
the
day
before
yesterday
,
and
who
had
not
contributed
so
much
as
a
bottle
of
champagne
!
  
<EOS>
"
We
're
to
dine
at
four
,
and
now
it
's
half
-
past
three
,
"
said
Mrs.
Greenow
,
addressing
herself
to
the
multitude
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
to
begin
to
dance
at
six
,
"
said
an
eager
young
lady
.
  
<EOS>
"
Maria
,
hold
your
tongue
,
"
said
the
young
lady
's
mother
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
we
'll
dine
at
four
,
"
said
Mr.
Cheesacre
.
<EOS>
"
And
as
for
the
music
,
I
've
ordered
it
to
be
here
punctual
at
half
-
past
five
.
<EOS>
We
're
to
have
three
horns
,
cymbals
,
triangle
,
and
a
drum
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
very
nice
;
is
n't
it
,
Mrs.
Greenow
?
"
said
Charlie
Fairstairs
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
now
suppose
we
begin
to
unpack
,
"
said
Captain
Bellfield
.
<EOS>
"
Half
the
fun
is
in
arranging
the
things
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
dear
,
yes
;
more
than
half
,
"
said
Fanny
Fairstairs
.
  
<EOS>
"
Bellfield
,
do
n't
mind
about
the
hampers
,
"
said
Cheesacre
.
<EOS>
"
Wine
is
a
ticklish
thing
to
handle
,
and
there
's
my
man
there
to
manage
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
odd
if
I
do
n't
know
more
about
wine
than
the
boots
from
the
hotel
,
"
said
Bellfield
.
<EOS>
This
allusion
to
the
boots
almost
cowed
Mr.
Cheesacre
,
and
made
him
turn
away
,
leaving
Bellfield
with
the
widow
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
great
unpacking
,
during
which
Captain
Bellfield
and
Mrs.
Greenow
constantly
had
their
heads
in
the
same
hamper
.
<EOS>
I
by
no
means
intend
to
insinuate
that
there
was
anything
wrong
in
this
.
<EOS>
People
engaged
together
in
unpacking
pies
and
cold
chickens
must
have
their
heads
in
the
same
hamper
.
<EOS>
But
a
great
intimacy
was
thereby
produced
,
and
the
widow
seemed
to
have
laid
aside
altogether
that
prejudice
of
hers
with
reference
to
the
washerwoman
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
long
table
placed
on
the
sand
,
sheltered
by
the
upturned
boat
from
the
land
side
,
but
open
towards
the
sea
,
and
over
this
,
supported
on
poles
,
there
was
an
awning
.
<EOS>
Upon
the
whole
the
arrangement
was
not
an
uncomfortable
one
for
people
who
had
selected
so
very
uncomfortable
a
dining
-
room
as
the
sand
of
the
sea
-
shore
.
<EOS>
Much
was
certainly
due
to
Mr.
Cheesacre
for
the
expenditure
he
had
incurred
,
 
and
something
perhaps
to
Captain
Bellfield
for
his
ingenuity
in
having
suggested
it
.
  
<EOS>
Now
came
the
placing
of
the
guests
for
dinner
,
and
Mr.
Cheesacre
made
another
great
effort
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
tell
you
what
,
"
he
said
,
aloud
,
"
<EOS>
Bellfield
and
<EOS>
I
will
take
the
two
ends
of
the
table
,
and
Mrs.
Greenow
shall
sit
at
my
right
hand
.
<EOS>
"
This
was
not
only
boldly
done
,
but
there
was
a
propriety
in
it
which
at
first
sight
seemed
to
be
irresistible
.
<EOS>
Much
as
he
had
hated
and
did
hate
the
captain
,
he
had
skilfully
made
the
proposition
in
such
a
way
as
to
flatter
him
,
and
it
seemed
for
a
few
moments
as
though
he
were
going
to
have
it
all
his
own
way
.
<EOS>
But
Captain
Bellfield
was
not
a
man
to
submit
to
defeat
in
such
a
matter
as
this
without
an
effort
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
that
will
do
,
"
said
he
.
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Greenow
gives
the
dinner
,
and
Cheesacre
gives
the
wine
.
<EOS>
We
must
have
them
at
the
two
ends
of
the
table
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
Mrs.
Greenow
wo
n't
refuse
to
allow
me
to
hand
her
to
the
place
which
belongs
to
her
.
<EOS>
I
will
sit
at
her
right
hand
and
be
her
minister
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Greenow
did
not
refuse
,
 
and
so
the
matter
was
adjusted
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Cheesacre
took
his
seat
in
despair
.
<EOS>
It
was
nothing
to
him
that
he
had
Kate
Vavasor
at
his
left
hand
.
<EOS>
He
liked
talking
to
Kate
very
well
,
but
he
could
not
enjoy
that
pleasure
while
Captain
Bellfield
was
in
the
very
act
of
making
progress
with
the
widow
.
<EOS>
"
One
would
think
that
he
had
given
it
himself
;
would
n't
you
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
to
Maria
's
mother
,
who
sat
at
his
right
hand
.
  
<EOS>
The
lady
did
not
in
the
least
understand
him
.
"
<EOS>
Given
what
?
"
said
she
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
the
music
and
the
wine
and
all
the
rest
of
it
.
<EOS>
There
are
some
people
full
of
that
kind
of
impudence
.
<EOS>
How
they
manage
to
carry
it
on
without
ever
paying
a
shilling
,
I
never
could
tell
.
<EOS>
I
know
I
have
to
pay
my
way
,
and
something
over
and
beyond
generally
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Maria
's
mother
said
,
"
Yes
,
indeed
.
"
<EOS>
She
had
other
daughters
there
besides
Maria
,
and
was
looking
down
the
table
to
see
whether
they
were
judiciously
placed
.
<EOS>
Her
beauty
,
her
youngest
one
,
Ophelia
,
was
sitting
next
to
that
ne'er
-
do
-
well
Joe
Fairstairs
,
and
this
made
her
unhappy
.
<EOS>
"
Ophelia
,
my
dear
,
you
are
dreadfully
in
the
draught
;
there
's
a
seat
up
here
,
just
opposite
,
where
you
'll
be
more
comfortable
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
no
draught
here
,
mamma
,
"
said
Ophelia
,
without
the
slightest
sign
of
moving
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
Ophelia
liked
the
society
of
that
lanky
,
idle
,
useless
young
man
.
  
<EOS>
The
mirth
of
the
table
certainly
came
from
Mrs.
Greenow
's
end
.
<EOS>
The
widow
had
hardly
taken
her
place
before
she
got
up
again
and
changed
with
the
captain
.
<EOS>
It
was
found
that
the
captain
could
better
carve
the
great
grouse
pie
from
the
end
than
from
the
side
.
<EOS>
Cheesacre
,
when
he
saw
this
,
absolutely
threw
down
his
knife
and
fork
violently
upon
the
table
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Is
anything
the
matter
?
"
said
Maria
's
mother
.
  
<EOS>
"
Matter
!
"
said
he
.
<EOS>
Then
he
shook
his
head
in
grief
of
heart
and
vexation
of
spirit
,
and
resumed
his
knife
and
fork
.
<EOS>
Kate
watched
it
all
,
and
was
greatly
amused
.
<EOS>
"
I
never
saw
a
man
so
nearly
broken
-
hearted
,
"
she
said
,
in
her
letter
to
Alice
the
next
day
.
<EOS>
"
Eleven
,
thirteen
,
eighteen
,
twenty
-
one
,
"
said
Cheesacre
to
himself
,
reckoning
up
in
his
misery
the
number
of
pounds
sterling
which
he
would
have
to
pay
for
being
ill
-
treated
in
this
way
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ladies
and
gentlemen
,
"
said
Captain
Bellfield
,
as
soon
as
the
eating
was
over
,
"
if
I
may
be
permitted
to
get
upon
my
legs
for
two
minutes
,
I
am
going
to
propose
a
toast
to
you
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
real
patron
of
the
feast
had
actually
not
yet
swallowed
his
last
bit
of
cheese
.
<EOS>
The
thing
was
indecent
in
the
violence
of
its
injustice
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
please
,
Captain
Bellfield
,
"
said
the
patron
,
indifferent
to
the
cheese
in
his
throat
,
"
I
'll
propose
the
toast
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nothing
on
earth
could
be
better
,
my
dear
fellow
,
"
said
the
captain
,
"
and
I
'm
sure
I
should
be
the
last
man
in
the
world
to
take
the
job
out
of
the
hands
of
one
who
would
do
it
so
much
better
than
I
can
;
but
as
it
's
your
health
that
we
're
going
to
drink
,
I
really
do
n't
see
how
you
are
to
do
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Cheesacre
grunted
and
sat
down
.
<EOS>
He
certainly
could
not
propose
his
own
health
,
nor
did
he
complain
of
the
honour
that
was
to
be
done
him
.
<EOS>
It
was
very
proper
that
his
health
should
be
drunk
,
and
he
had
now
to
think
of
the
words
in
which
he
would
return
thanks
.
<EOS>
But
the
extent
of
his
horror
may
be
imagined
when
Bellfield
got
up
and
made
a
most
brilliant
speech
in
praise
of
Mrs.
Greenow
.
<EOS>
For
full
five
minutes
he
went
on
without
mentioning
the
name
of
Cheesacre
.
<EOS>
Yarmouth
,
he
said
,
had
never
in
his
days
been
so
blessed
as
it
had
been
this
year
by
the
presence
of
the
lady
who
was
now
with
them
.
<EOS>
She
had
come
among
them
,
he
declared
,
forgetful
of
herself
and
of
her
great
sorrows
,
with
the
sole
desire
of
adding
something
to
the
happiness
of
others
.
<EOS>
Then
Mrs.
Greenow
had
taken
out
her
pocket
-
handkerchief
,
sweeping
back
the
broad
ribbons
of
her
cap
over
her
shoulders
.
<EOS>
Altogether
the
scene
was
very
affecting
,
and
Cheesacre
was
driven
to
madness
.
<EOS>
They
were
the
very
words
that
he
had
intended
to
speak
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hate
all
this
kind
of
thing
,
"
he
said
to
Kate
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
so
fulsome
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
After
-
dinner
speeches
never
mean
anything
,
"
said
Kate
.
  
<EOS>
At
last
,
when
Bellfield
had
come
to
an
end
of
praising
Mrs.
Greenow
,
he
told
the
guests
that
he
wished
to
join
his
friend
Mr.
Cheesacre
in
the
toast
,
the
more
so
as
it
could
hardly
be
hoped
that
Mrs.
Greenow
would
herself
rise
to
return
thanks
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
better
fellow
than
his
friend
Cheesacre
,
whom
he
had
known
for
he
would
not
say
how
many
years
.
<EOS>
He
was
quite
sure
they
would
all
have
the
most
sincere
pleasure
in
joining
the
health
of
Mr.
Cheesacre
with
that
of
Mrs.
Greenow
.
<EOS>
Then
there
was
a
clattering
of
glasses
and
a
murmuring
of
healths
,
and
Mr.
Cheesacre
slowly
got
upon
his
legs
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
very
much
obliged
to
this
company
,
"
said
he
,
"
and
to
my
friend
Bellfield
,
who
really
is
,
 
<EOS>
but
perhaps
that
does
n't
signify
now
.
<EOS>
I
've
had
the
greatest
pleasure
in
getting
up
this
little
thing
,
and
I
'd
made
up
my
mind
to
propose
Mrs.
Greenow
's
health
;
but
,
h'm
,
ha
,
no
doubt
it
has
been
in
better
hands
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
,
considering
all
things
,
Bellfield
might
have
waited
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
With
such
a
subject
on
my
hands
,
I
could
n't
wait
a
moment
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
interrupt
you
,
Captain
Bellfield
,
and
<EOS>
perhaps
you
'll
let
me
go
on
without
interrupting
me
.
<EOS>
We
've
all
drunk
Mrs.
Greenow
's
health
,
and
I
'm
sure
she
's
very
much
obliged
.
<EOS>
So
am
I
for
the
honour
you
've
done
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
taken
some
trouble
in
getting
up
this
little
thing
,
and
I
hope
you
like
it
.
<EOS>
I
think
somebody
said
something
about
liberality
.
<EOS>
I
beg
to
assure
you
that
I
do
n't
think
of
that
for
a
moment
.
<EOS>
Somebody
must
pay
for
these
sort
of
things
,
and
I
'm
always
very
glad
to
take
my
turn
.
<EOS>
I
dare
say
Bellfield
will
give
us
the
next
picnic
,
and
if
he
'll
appoint
a
day
before
the
end
of
the
month
,
I
shall
be
happy
to
be
one
of
the
party
.
"
<EOS>
Then
he
sat
down
with
some
inward
satisfaction
,
fully
convinced
that
he
had
given
his
enemy
a
fatal
blow
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nothing
on
earth
would
give
me
so
much
pleasure
,
"
said
Bellfield
.
<EOS>
After
that
he
turned
again
to
Mrs.
Greenow
and
went
on
with
his
private
conversation
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
no
more
speaking
,
nor
was
there
much
time
for
other
after
-
dinner
ceremonies
.
<EOS>
The
three
horns
,
the
cymbals
,
the
triangle
,
and
the
drum
were
soon
heard
tuning
-
up
behind
the
banqueting
-
hall
,
and
the
ladies
went
to
the
further
end
of
the
old
boat
to
make
their
preparations
for
the
dance
.
<EOS>
Then
it
was
that
the
thoughtful
care
of
Mrs.
Greenow
,
in
having
sent
Jeannette
with
brushes
,
combs
,
clean
handkerchiefs
,
and
other
little
knick
-
knackeries
,
became
so
apparent
.
<EOS>
It
was
said
that
the
widow
herself
actually
changed
her
cap
,
 
which
was
considered
by
some
to
be
very
unfair
,
as
there
had
been
an
understanding
that
there
should
be
no
dressing
.
<EOS>
On
such
occasions
ladies
are
generally
willing
to
forego
the
advantage
of
dressing
on
the
condition
that
other
ladies
shall
forego
the
same
advantage
;
but
when
this
compact
is
broken
by
any
special
lady
,
the
treason
is
thought
to
be
very
treacherous
.
<EOS>
It
is
as
though
a
fencer
should
remove
the
button
from
the
end
of
his
foil
.
<EOS>
But
Mrs.
Greenow
was
so
good
-
natured
in
tendering
the
services
of
Jeannette
to
all
the
young
ladies
,
and
was
so
willing
to
share
with
others
those
good
things
of
the
toilet
which
her
care
had
provided
,
that
her
cap
was
forgiven
her
by
the
most
of
those
present
.
  
<EOS>
When
ladies
have
made
up
their
minds
to
dance
they
will
dance
let
the
circumstances
of
the
moment
be
ever
so
antagonistic
to
that
exercise
.
<EOS>
A
ploughed
field
in
February
would
not
be
too
wet
,
nor
the
side
of
a
house
too
uneven
.
<EOS>
In
honest
truth
the
sands
of
the
seashore
are
not
adapted
for
the
exercise
.
<EOS>
It
was
all
very
well
for
Venus
to
make
the
promise
,
but
when
making
it
she
knew
that
Adonis
would
not
keep
her
to
her
word
.
<EOS>
Let
any
lightest
-
limbed
nymph
try
it
,
and
she
will
find
that
she
leaves
most
palpable
footing
.
<EOS>
The
sands
in
question
were
doubtless
compact
,
firm
,
and
sufficiently
moist
to
make
walking
on
them
comfortable
;
but
they
ruffled
themselves
most
uncomfortably
under
the
unwonted
pressure
to
which
they
were
subjected
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
our
friends
did
dance
on
the
sands
;
finding
,
however
,
that
quadrilles
and
Sir
Roger
de
Coverley
suited
them
better
than
polkas
and
waltzes
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
my
friend
,
no
,
"
Mrs.
Greenow
said
to
Mr.
Cheesacre
when
that
gentleman
endeavoured
to
persuade
her
to
stand
up
;
"
Kate
will
be
delighted
I
am
sure
to
join
you
,
 
<EOS>
but
as
for
me
,
you
must
excuse
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
But
Mr.
Cheesacre
was
not
inclined
at
that
moment
to
ask
Kate
Vavasor
to
dance
with
him
.
<EOS>
He
was
possessed
by
an
undefined
idea
that
Kate
had
snubbed
him
,
and
as
Kate
's
fortune
was
,
as
he
said
,
literally
nothing
,
he
was
not
at
all
disposed
to
court
her
favour
at
the
expense
of
such
suffering
to
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
not
quite
sure
that
I
'll
dance
myself
,
"
said
he
,
seating
himself
in
a
corner
of
the
tent
by
Mrs.
Greenow
's
side
.
<EOS>
Captain
Bellfield
at
that
moment
was
seen
leading
Miss
Vavasor
away
to
a
new
place
on
the
sands
,
whither
he
was
followed
by
a
score
of
dancers
;
and
Mr.
Cheesacre
saw
that
now
at
last
he
might
reap
the
reward
for
which
he
had
laboured
.
<EOS>
He
was
alone
with
the
widow
,
and
having
been
made
bold
by
wine
,
had
an
opportunity
of
fighting
his
battle
,
than
which
none
better
could
ever
be
found
.
<EOS>
He
was
himself
by
no
means
a
poor
man
,
and
he
despised
poverty
in
others
.
<EOS>
It
was
well
that
there
should
be
poor
gentry
,
in
order
that
they
might
act
as
satellites
to
those
who
,
like
himself
,
had
money

<EOS>
As
to
Mrs.
Greenow
's
money
,
there
was
no
doubt
.
<EOS>
He
knew
it
all
to
a
fraction
.
<EOS>
She
had
spread
for
herself
,
or
some
one
else
had
spread
for
her
,
a
report
that
her
wealth
was
almost
unlimited
;
but
the
forty
thousand
pounds
was
a
fact
,
and
any
such
innocent
fault
as
that
little
fiction
might
well
be
forgiven
to
a
woman
endorsed
with
such
substantial
virtues
.
<EOS>
And
she
was
handsome
too
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Cheesacre
,
as
he
regarded
her
matured
charms
,
sometimes
felt
that
he
should
have
been
smitten
even
without
the
forty
thousand
pounds
.
"
<EOS>
By
George
!
<EOS>
there
's
flesh
and
blood
,
"
he
had
once
said
to
his
friend
Bellfield
before
he
had
begun
to
suspect
that
man
's
treachery
.
<EOS>
His
admiration
must
then
have
been
sincere
,
for
at
that
time
the
forty
thousand
pounds
was
not
an
ascertained
fact
.
<EOS>
Looking
at
the
matter
in
all
its
bearings
Mr.
Cheesacre
thought
that
he
could
n't
do
better
.
<EOS>
His
wooing
should
be
fair
,
honest
,
and
above
board
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
thriving
man
,
and
what
might
not
they
two
do
in
Norfolk
if
they
put
their
wealth
together
?
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Mr.
Cheesacre
,
you
should
join
them
,
"
said
Mrs.
Greenow
;
"
they
'll
not
half
enjoy
themselves
without
you
.
<EOS>
Kate
will
think
that
you
mean
to
neglect
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
sha
n't
dance
,
Mrs.
Greenow
,
unless
you
like
to
stand
up
for
a
set
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
my
friend
,
no
;
I
shall
not
do
that
.
<EOS>
I
fear
you
forget
how
recent
has
been
my
bereavement
.
<EOS>
Your
asking
me
is
the
bitterest
reproach
to
me
for
having
ventured
to
join
your
festive
board
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Upon
my
honour
I
did
n't
mean
it
,
Mrs.
Greenow
.
<EOS>
I
did
n't
mean
it
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
suspect
you
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
been
unmanly
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
nobody
can
say
that
of
me
.
<EOS>
There
is
n't
a
man
or
woman
in
Norfolk
that
would
n't
say
I
was
manly
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
quite
sure
of
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
my
faults
,
I
'm
aware
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
what
are
your
faults
,
Mr.
Cheesacre
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
;
perhaps
I
'm
extravagant
.
<EOS>
But
it
's
only
in
these
kind
of
things
you
know
,
when
I
spend
a
little
money
for
the
sake
of
making
my
friends
happy
.
<EOS>
When
I
'm
about
,
on
the
lands
at
home
,
I
ai
n't
extravagant
,
I
can
tell
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Extravagance
is
a
great
vice
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
ai
n't
extravagant
in
that
sense
;
 
not
a
bit
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
But
when
a
man
's
enamoured
,
and
perhaps
looking
out
for
a
wife
,
he
does
like
to
be
a
little
free
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
are
you
looking
out
for
a
wife
,
Mr.
Cheesacre
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
told
you
I
suppose
you
'd
only
laugh
at
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
indeed
I
would
not
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
given
to
joking
when
any
one
that
I
regard
speaks
to
me
seriously
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Ai
n't
you
though
?
<EOS>
I
'm
so
glad
of
that
.
<EOS>
When
one
has
really
got
a
serious
thing
to
say
,
one
does
n't
like
to
have
fun
poked
at
one
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
,
besides
,
how
could
I
laugh
at
marriages
,
seeing
how
happy
I
have
been
in
that
condition
?
 
<EOS>
so
 
very
 
happy
,
"
and
<EOS>
Mrs.
Greenow
put
up
her
handkerchief
to
her
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
happy
that
you
'll
try
it
again
some
day
;
wo
n't
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Never
,
Mr.
Cheesacre
;
never
.
<EOS>
Is
that
the
way
you
talk
of
serious
things
without
joking
?
<EOS>
Anything
like
love
 
love
of
that
sort
 
is
over
for
me
.
<EOS>
It
lies
buried
under
the
sod
with
my
poor
dear
departed
saint
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
Mrs.
Greenow
,
"
 
and
Cheesacre
,
as
he
prepared
to
argue
the
question
with
her
,
got
nearer
to
her
in
the
corner
behind
the
table
,
 
"
But
,
Mrs.
Greenow
,
care
killed
a
cat
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
sometimes
I
think
that
care
will
kill
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
by
George
;
not
if
I
can
prevent
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
're
very
kind
,
Mr.
Cheesacre
;
but
there
's
no
preventing
such
care
as
mine
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
n't
there
though
?
<EOS>
I
'll
tell
you
what
,
Mrs.
Greenow
;
I
'm
in
earnest
,
I
am
indeed
.
<EOS>
If
you
'll
inquire
,
you
'll
find
there
is
n't
a
fellow
in
Norfolk
pays
his
way
better
than
I
do
,
or
is
better
able
to
do
it
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
pay
a
sixpence
of
rent
,
and
I
sit
upon
seven
hundred
acres
of
as
good
land
as
there
is
in
the
county
.
<EOS>
There
's
not
an
acre
that
wo
n't
do
me
a
bullock
and
a
half
.
<EOS>
Just
put
that
and
that
together
,
and
see
what
it
comes
to
.
<EOS>
And
,
mind
you
,
some
of
these
fellows
that
farm
their
own
land
are
worse
off
than
if
they
'd
rent
to
pay
.
<EOS>
They
've
borrowed
so
much
to
carry
on
with
,
that
the
interest
is
more
than
rent
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
owe
a
sixpence
to
ere
a
man
or
ere
a
company
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
I
can
walk
into
every
bank
in
Norwich
without
seeing
my
master
.
<EOS>
There
ai
n't
any
of
my
paper
flying
about
,
Mrs.
Greenow
.
<EOS>
I
'm
Samuel
Cheesacre
of
Oileymead
,
and
it
's
all
my
own
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Cheesacre
,
as
he
thus
spoke
of
his
good
fortunes
and
firm
standing
in
the
world
,
became
impetuous
in
the
energy
of
the
moment
,
and
brought
down
his
fist
powerfully
on
the
slight
table
before
them
.
<EOS>
The
whole
fabric
rattled
,
and
the
boat
resounded
,
but
the
noise
he
had
made
seemed
to
assist
him
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
all
my
own
,
Mrs.
Greenow
,
and
the
half
of
it
shall
be
yours
if
you
'll
please
to
take
it
;
"
then
he
stretched
out
his
hand
to
her
,
not
as
though
he
intended
to
grasp
hers
in
a
grasp
of
love
,
but
as
if
he
expected
some
hand
-
pledge
from
her
as
a
token
that
she
accepted
the
bargain
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
'd
known
Greenow
,
Mr.
Cheesacre
 
"
  
"
I
've
no
doubt
he
was
a
very
good
sort
of
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
'd
known
him
,
you
would
not
have
addressed
me
in
this
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
difference
would
that
make
?
<EOS>
My
idea
is
that
care
killed
a
cat
,
as
I
said
before
.
<EOS>
I
never
knew
what
was
the
good
of
being
unhappy
.
<EOS>
If
I
find
early
mangels
do
n't
do
on
a
bit
of
land
,
then
I
sow
late
turnips
;
and
never
cry
after
spilt
milk
.
<EOS>
Greenow
was
the
early
mangels
;
I
'll
be
the
late
turnips
.
<EOS>
Come
then
,
say
the
word
.
<EOS>
There
ai
n't
a
bedroom
in
my
house
,
 
not
one
of
the
front
ones
,
 
that
is
n't
mahogany
furnished
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
's
furniture
to
me
?
"
said
Mrs.
Greenow
,
with
her
handkerchief
to
her
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
Just
at
this
moment
Maria
's
mother
stepped
in
under
the
canvas
.
<EOS>
It
was
most
inopportune
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Cheesacre
felt
that
he
was
progressing
well
,
and
was
conscious
that
he
had
got
safely
over
those
fences
in
the
race
which
his
bashfulness
would
naturally
make
difficult
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
knew
that
he
had
done
this
under
the
influence
of
the
champagne
,
and
was
aware
that
it
might
not
be
easy
to
procure
again
a
combination
of
circumstances
that
would
be
so
beneficial
to
him
.
<EOS>
But
now
he
was
interrupted
just
as
he
was
expecting
success
.
<EOS>
He
was
interrupted
,
and
felt
himself
to
be
looking
like
a
guilty
creature
under
the
eye
of
the
strange
lady
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
a
word
to
say
;
but
drawing
himself
suddenly
a
foot
and
half
away
from
the
widow
's
side
,
sat
there
confessing
his
guilt
in
his
face
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Greenow
felt
no
guilt
,
and
was
afraid
of
no
strange
eyes
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Cheesacre
and
I
are
talking
about
farming
,
"
she
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
;
farming
!
"
answered
Maria
's
mother
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Cheesacre
thinks
that
turnips
are
better
than
early
mangels
,
"
said
Mrs.
Greenow
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
do
,
"
said
Cheesacre
,
  
<EOS>
"
I
prefer
the
early
mangels
,
"
said
Mrs.
Greenow
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
nature
ever
intended
those
late
crops
.
<EOS>
What
do
you
say
,
Mrs.
Walker
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
daresay
Mr.
Cheesacre
understands
what
he
's
about
when
he
's
at
home
,
"
said
the
lady
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
what
a
bit
of
land
can
do
as
well
as
any
man
in
Norfolk
,
"
said
the
gentleman
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
may
be
very
well
in
Norfolk
,
"
said
Mrs.
Greenow
,
rising
from
her
seat
;
"
but
the
practice
is
n't
thought
much
of
in
the
other
counties
with
which
I
am
better
acquainted
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'd
just
come
in
to
say
that
I
thought
we
might
be
getting
to
the
boats
,
"
said
Mrs.
Walker
.
<EOS>
"
My
Ophelia
is
so
delicate
.
"
<EOS>
At
this
moment
the
delicate
Ophelia
was
to
be
seen
,
under
the
influence
of
the
music
,
taking
a
distant
range
upon
the
sands
with
Joe
Fairstairs
<EOS>
"
arm
round
her
waist
.
<EOS>
The
attitude
was
justified
by
the
tune
that
was
in
progress
,
and
there
is
no
reason
why
a
galop
on
the
sands
should
have
any
special
termination
in
distance
,
as
it
must
have
in
a
room
.
<EOS>
But
,
under
such
circumstances
,
Mrs.
Walker
's
solicitude
was
not
unreasonable
.
  
<EOS>
The
erratic
steps
of
the
distant
dancers
were
recalled
and
preparations
were
made
for
the
return
journey
.
<EOS>
Others
had
strayed
besides
the
delicate
Ophelia
and
the
idle
Joe
,
and
some
little
time
was
taken
up
in
collecting
the
party
.
<EOS>
The
boats
had
to
be
drawn
down
,
and
the
boatmen
fetched
from
their
cans
and
tobacco
-
pipes
.
<EOS>
"
I
hope
they
're
sober
,
"
said
Mrs.
Walker
,
with
a
look
of
great
dismay
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sober
as
judges
,
"
said
Bellfield
,
who
had
himself
been
looking
after
the
remains
of
Mr.
Cheesacre
's
hampers
,
while
that
gentleman
had
been
so
much
better
engaged
in
the
tent
.
  
<EOS>
"
Because
,
"
continued
Mrs.
Walker
,
"
I
know
that
they
play
all
manner
of
tricks
when
they
're
 
in
liquor
.
<EOS>
They
'd
think
nothing
of
taking
us
out
to
sea
,
Mrs.
Greenow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
do
wish
they
would
,
"
said
Ophelia
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ophelia
,
mind
you
come
in
the
boat
with
me
,
"
said
her
mother
,
and
she
looked
very
savage
when
she
gave
the
order
.
<EOS>
It
was
Mrs.
Walker
's
intention
that
that
boat
should
not
carry
Joe
Fairstairs
.
<EOS>
But
Joe
and
her
daughter
together
were
too
clever
for
her
.
<EOS>
When
the
boats
went
off
she
found
herself
to
be
in
that
one
over
which
Mr.
Cheesacre
presided
,
while
the
sinning
Ophelia
with
her
good
-
for
-
nothing
admirer
were
under
the
more
mirthful
protection
of
Captain
Bellfield
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mamma
will
be
so
angry
,
"
said
Ophelia
,
"
and
it
was
all
your
fault
.
<EOS>
I
did
mean
to
go
into
the
other
boat
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
,
Mr.
Fairstairs
.
<EOS>
"
Then
they
got
settled
down
in
their
seats
,
to
the
satisfaction
,
let
us
hope
,
of
them
both
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Cheesacre
had
vainly
endeavoured
to
arrange
that
Mrs.
Greenow
should
return
with
him
.
<EOS>
But
not
only
was
Captain
Bellfield
opposed
to
such
a
change
in
their
positions
,
but
so
also
was
Mrs.
Greenow
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
we
'd
better
go
back
as
we
came
,
"
she
said
,
giving
her
hand
to
the
Captain
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
certainly
,
"
said
Captain
Bellfield
.
<EOS>
"
Why
should
there
be
any
change
?
<EOS>
Cheesacre
,
old
fellow
,
mind
<EOS>
you
look
after
Mrs.
Walker
.
<EOS>
Come
along
,
my
hearty
.
<EOS>
"
It
really
almost
appeared
that
Captain
Bellfield
was
addressing
Mrs.
Greenow
as
"
his
hearty
,
"
but
it
must
be
presumed
that
the
term
of
genial
endearment
was
intended
for
the
whole
boat
's
load
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Greenow
took
her
place
on
the
comfortable
broad
bench
in
the
stern
,
and
Bellfield
seated
himself
beside
her
,
with
the
tiller
in
his
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
're
going
to
steer
,
Captain
Bellfield
,
I
beg
that
you
'll
be
careful
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Careful
,
 
and
with
you
on
board
!
"
said
the
Captain
.
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
you
know
that
I
would
sooner
perish
beneath
the
waves
than
that
a
drop
of
water
should
touch
you
roughly
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
see
,
we
might
perish
beneath
the
waves
together
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Together
!
<EOS>
What
a
sweet
word
that
is
;
 
perish
together
!
<EOS>
If
it
were
not
that
there
might
be
something
better
even
than
that
,
I
would
wish
to
perish
in
such
company
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
should
not
wish
anything
of
the
kind
,
Captain
Bellfield
,
and
therefore
pray
be
careful
.
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
no
perishing
by
water
on
that
occasion
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Cheesacre
's
boat
reached
the
pier
at
Yarmouth
first
,
and
gave
up
its
load
without
accident
.
<EOS>
Very
shortly
afterwards
Captain
Bellfield
's
crew
reached
the
same
place
in
the
same
state
of
preservation
.
<EOS>
"
There
,
"
said
he
,
as
he
handed
out
Mrs.
Greenow
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
brought
you
to
no
harm
,
at
any
rate
as
yet
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
,
as
I
hope
,
will
not
do
so
hereafter
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
May
the
heavens
forbid
it
,
Mrs.
Greenow
!
<EOS>
Whatever
may
be
our
lots
hereafter
,
 
yours
<EOS>
I
mean
and
mine
,
 
<EOS>
I
trust
that
yours
may
be
free
from
all
disaster
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
that
I
might
venture
to
hope
that
,
at
some
future
day
,
the
privilege
might
be
mine
of
protecting
you
from
all
danger
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
protect
myself
very
well
,
I
can
assure
you
.
<EOS>
Good
night
,
Captain
Bellfield
.
<EOS>
We
wo
n't
take
you
and
Mr.
Cheesacre
out
of
your
way
;
 
will
we
,
Kate
?
<EOS>
We
have
had
a
most
pleasant
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
They
were
now
upon
the
esplanade
,
and
Mrs.
Greenow
's
house
was
to
the
right
,
whereas
the
lodgings
of
both
the
gentlemen
were
to
the
left
.
<EOS>
Each
of
them
fought
hard
for
the
privilege
of
accompanying
the
widow
to
her
door
;
but
Mrs.
Greenow
was
self
-
willed
,
and
upon
this
occasion
would
have
neither
of
them
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Joe
Fairstairs
must
pass
the
house
,
"
said
she
,
"
and
he
will
see
us
home
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Cheesacre
,
good
night
.
<EOS>
Indeed
you
shall
not
;
 
not
a
step
.
<EOS>
"
There
was
that
in
her
voice
which
induced
Mr.
Cheesacre
to
obey
her
,
and
which
made
Captain
Bellfield
aware
that
he
would
only
injure
his
cause
if
he
endeavoured
to
make
further
progress
in
it
on
the
present
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Kate
,
what
do
you
think
of
the
day
?
<EOS>
"
the
aunt
said
when
she
was
alone
with
her
niece
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
think
much
about
such
days
,
aunt
.
<EOS>
It
was
all
very
well
,
but
I
fear
I
have
not
the
temperament
fitted
for
enjoying
the
fun
.
<EOS>
I
envied
Ophelia
Walker
because
she
made
herself
thoroughly
happy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
like
to
see
girls
enjoy
themselves
,
"
said
Mrs.
Greenow
,
"
I
do
,
indeed
;
 
and
young
men
too
.
<EOS>
It
seems
so
natural
;
why
should
n't
young
people
flirt
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Or
old
people
either
for
the
matter
of
that
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Or
old
people
either
,
 
if
they
do
n't
do
any
harm
to
anybody
.
<EOS>
I
'll
tell
you
what
it
is
,
Kate
;
people
have
become
so
very
virtuous
,
that
they
're
driven
into
all
manner
of
abominable
resources
for
amusement
and
occupation
.
<EOS>
If
I
had
sons
and
daughters
<EOS>
I
should
think
a
little
flirting
the
very
best
thing
for
them
as
a
safety
valve
.
<EOS>
When
people
get
to
be
old
,
there
's
a
difficulty
.
<EOS>
They
want
to
flirt
with
the
young
people
and
the
young
people
do
n't
want
them
.
<EOS>
If
the
old
people
would
be
content
to
flirt
together
,
I
do
n't
see
why
they
should
ever
give
it
up
;
 
till
they
're
obliged
to
give
up
every
thing
,
and
go
away
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
That
was
Mrs.
Greenow
's
doctrine
on
the
subject
of
flirtation
.
   
<EOS>
Nethercoats
.
 
<EOS>
We
will
leave
Mrs.
Greenow
with
her
niece
and
two
sisters
at
Yarmouth
,
and
returning
by
stages
to
London
,
will
call
upon
Mr.
Grey
at
his
place
in
Cambridgeshire
as
we
pass
by
.
<EOS>
I
believe
it
is
conceded
by
all
the
other
counties
,
that
Cambridgeshire
possesses
fewer
rural
beauties
than
any
other
county
in
England
.
<EOS>
It
is
very
flat
;
it
is
not
well
timbered
;
the
rivers
are
merely
dikes
;
and
in
a
very
large
portion
of
the
county
the
farms
and
fields
are
divided
simply
by
ditches
 
not
by
hedgerows
.
<EOS>
Such
arrangements
are
,
no
doubt
,
well
adapted
for
agricultural
purposes
,
but
are
not
conducive
to
rural
beauty
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Grey
's
residence
was
situated
in
a
part
of
Cambridgeshire
in
which
the
above
-
named
characteristics
are
very
much
marked
.
<EOS>
It
was
in
the
Isle
of
Ely
,
some
few
miles
distant
from
the
Cathedral
town
,
on
the
side
of
a
long
straight
road
,
which
ran
through
the
fields
for
miles
without
even
a
bush
to
cheer
it
.
<EOS>
The
name
of
his
place
was
Nethercoats
,
and
here
he
lived
generally
throughout
the
year
,
and
here
he
intended
to
live
throughout
his
life
.
  
<EOS>
His
father
had
held
a
prebendal
stall
at
Ely
in
times
when
prebendal
stalls
were
worth
more
than
they
are
at
present
,
and
having
also
been
possessed
of
a
living
in
the
neighbourhood
,
had
amassed
a
considerable
sum
of
money
.
<EOS>
With
this
he
had
during
his
life
purchased
the
property
of
Nethercoats
,
and
had
built
on
it
the
house
in
which
his
son
now
lived
.
<EOS>
He
had
married
late
in
life
,
and
had
lost
his
wife
soon
after
the
birth
of
an
only
child
.
<EOS>
The
house
had
been
built
in
his
own
parish
,
and
his
wife
had
lived
there
for
a
few
months
and
had
died
there
.
<EOS>
But
after
that
event
the
old
clergyman
had
gone
back
to
his
residence
in
the
Close
at
Ely
,
and
there
John
Grey
had
had
the
home
of
his
youth
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
brought
up
under
his
father
's
eye
,
having
been
sent
to
no
public
school
.
<EOS>
But
he
had
gone
to
Cambridge
,
had
taken
college
honours
,
and
had
then
,
his
father
dying
exactly
at
this
time
,
declined
to
accept
a
fellowship
.
<EOS>
His
father
had
left
to
him
an
income
of
some
fifteen
hundred
a
year
,
and
with
this
he
sat
himself
down
,
near
to
his
college
friends
,
near
also
to
the
old
cathedral
which
he
loved
,
in
the
house
which
his
father
had
built
.
  
<EOS>
But
though
Nethercoats
possessed
no
beauty
of
scenery
,
though
the
country
around
it
was
in
truth
as
uninteresting
as
any
country
could
be
,
it
had
many
delights
of
its
own
.
<EOS>
The
house
itself
was
as
excellent
a
residence
for
a
country
gentleman
of
small
means
as
taste
and
skill
together
could
construct
.
<EOS>
I
doubt
whether
prettier
rooms
were
ever
seen
than
the
drawing
-
room
,
the
library
,
and
the
dining
-
room
at
Nethercoats
.
<EOS>
They
were
all
on
the
ground
-
floor
,
and
all
opened
out
on
to
the
garden
and
lawn
.
<EOS>
The
library
,
which
was
the
largest
of
the
three
,
was
a
handsome
chamber
,
and
so
filled
as
to
make
it
well
known
in
the
University
as
one
of
the
best
private
collections
in
that
part
of
England
.
<EOS>
But
perhaps
the
gardens
of
Nethercoats
constituted
its
greatest
glory
.
<EOS>
They
were
spacious
and
excellently
kept
up
,
and
had
been
originally
laid
out
with
that
knowledge
of
gardening
without
which
no
garden
,
merely
as
a
garden
,
can
be
effective
.
<EOS>
And
such
,
of
necessity
,
was
the
garden
of
Nethercoats
.
<EOS>
Fine
single
forest
trees
there
were
none
there
,
nor
was
it
possible
that
there
should
have
been
any
such
.
<EOS>
Nor
could
there
be
a
clear
rippling
stream
with
steep
green
banks
,
and
broken
rocks
lying
about
its
bed
.
<EOS>
Such
beauties
are
beauties
of
landscape
,
and
do
not
of
their
nature
belong
to
a
garden
.
<EOS>
But
the
shrubs
of
Nethercoats
were
of
the
rarest
kind
,
and
had
been
long
enough
in
their
present
places
to
have
reached
the
period
of
their
beauty
.
<EOS>
Nothing
had
been
spared
that
a
garden
could
want
.
<EOS>
The
fruit
-
trees
were
perfect
in
their
kind
,
and
the
glass
-
houses
were
so
good
and
so
extensive
that
John
Grey
in
his
prudence
<EOS>
was
some
times
tempted
to
think
that
he
had
too
much
of
them
.
  
<EOS>
It
must
be
understood
that
there
were
no
grounds
,
according
to
the
meaning
usually
given
to
that
word
,
belonging
to
the
house
at
Nethercoats
.
<EOS>
Between
the
garden
and
the
public
road
there
was
a
paddock
belonging
to
the
house
,
along
the
side
of
which
,
but
divided
from
it
by
a
hedge
and
shrubbery
,
ran
the
private
carriageway
up
to
the
house
.
<EOS>
This
swept
through
the
small
front
flower
-
garden
,
dividing
it
equally
;
but
the
lawns
and
indeed
the
whole
of
that
which
made
the
beauty
of
the
place
lay
on
the
back
of
the
house
,
on
which
side
opened
the
windows
from
the
three
sitting
-
rooms
.
<EOS>
Down
on
the
public
road
there
stood
a
lodge
at
which
lived
one
of
the
gardeners
.
<EOS>
There
was
another
field
of
some
six
or
seven
acres
,
to
which
there
was
a
gate
from
the
corner
of
the
front
paddock
,
and
which
went
round
two
sides
of
the
garden
.
<EOS>
This
was
Nethercoats
,
and
the
whole
estate
covered
about
twelve
acres
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
not
a
place
for
much
bachelor
enjoyment
of
that
sort
generally
popular
with
bachelors
;
nevertheless
Mr.
Grey
had
been
constant
in
his
residence
there
for
the
seven
years
which
had
now
elapsed
since
he
had
left
his
college
.
<EOS>
His
easy
access
to
Cambridge
had
probably
done
much
to
mitigate
what
might
otherwise
have
been
the
too
great
tedium
of
his
life
;
and
he
had
,
prompted
thereto
by
early
associations
,
found
most
of
his
society
in
the
Close
of
Ely
Cathedral
.
<EOS>
But
,
with
all
the
delight
he
could
derive
from
these
two
sources
,
there
had
still
been
many
solitary
hours
in
his
life
,
and
he
had
gradually
learned
to
feel
that
he
of
all
men
wanted
a
companion
in
his
home
.
  
<EOS>
His
visits
to
London
had
generally
been
short
and
far
between
,
occasioned
probably
by
some
need
in
the
library
,
or
by
the
necessity
of
some
slight
literary
transaction
with
the
editor
or
publisher
of
a
periodical
.
<EOS>
In
one
of
these
visits
he
had
met
Alice
Vavasor
,
and
had
remained
in
Town
,
 
I
will
not
say
till
Alice
had
promised
to
share
his
home
in
Cambridgeshire
,
but
so
long
that
he
had
resolved
before
he
went
that
he
would
ask
her
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
He
had
asked
her
,
and
we
know
that
he
had
been
successful
.
<EOS>
He
had
obtained
her
promise
,
and
from
that
moment
all
his
life
had
been
changed
for
him
.
<EOS>
Hitherto
at
Nethercoats
his
little
smoking
-
room
,
his
books
,
and
his
plants
had
been
everything
to
him
.
<EOS>
Now
he
began
to
surround
himself
with
an
infinity
of
feminine
belongings
,
and
to
promise
himself
an
infinity
of
feminine
blessings
,
wondering
much
that
he
should
have
been
content
to
pass
so
long
a
portion
of
his
life
in
the
dull
seclusion
which
he
had
endured
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
by
nature
an
impatient
man
;
but
now
he
became
impatient
,
longing
for
the
fruition
of
his
new
idea
of
happiness
,
 
longing
to
have
that
as
his
own
which
he
certainly
loved
beyond
all
else
in
the
world
,
and
which
,
perhaps
,
was
all
he
had
ever
loved
with
the
perfect
love
of
equality
.
<EOS>
But
though
impatient
,
and
fully
aware
of
his
own
impatience
,
he
acknowledged
to
himself
that
Alice
could
not
be
expected
to
share
it
.
<EOS>
He
could
plan
nothing
now
,
 
could
have
no
pleasure
in
life
that
she
was
not
expected
to
share
.
<EOS>
But
as
yet
it
could
not
be
so
with
her
.
<EOS>
She
had
her
house
in
London
,
her
town
society
,
and
her
father
.
<EOS>
And
,
inasmuch
as
the
change
for
her
would
be
much
greater
than
it
would
be
for
him
<EOS>
,
it
was
natural
that
she
should
require
some
small
delay
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
pressed
her
.
<EOS>
At
least
he
had
not
pressed
her
with
that
eager
pressure
which
a
girl
must
resist
with
something
of
the
opposition
of
a
contest
,
if
she
resist
it
at
all
.
<EOS>
But
in
truth
his
impatience
was
now
waxing
strong
,
and
during
the
absence
in
Switzerland
of
which
we
have
spoken
,
he
resolved
that
a
marriage
very
late
in
the
autumn
,
 
that
a
marriage
even
in
winter
,
would
be
better
than
a
marriage
postponed
till
the
following
year
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
yet
late
in
August
when
the
party
returned
from
their
tour
.
<EOS>
Would
not
a
further
delay
of
two
months
suffice
for
his
bride
?
  
<EOS>
Alice
had
written
to
him
occasionally
from
Switzerland
,
and
her
first
two
letters
had
been
very
charming
.
<EOS>
They
had
referred
almost
exclusively
to
the
tour
,
and
had
been
made
pleasant
with
some
slightly
coloured
account
of
George
Vavasor
's
idleness
,
and
of
Kate
's
obedience
to
her
brother
's
behests
.
<EOS>
Alice
had
never
written
much
of
love
in
her
love
-
letters
,
and
Grey
was
well
enough
contented
with
her
style
,
though
it
was
not
impassioned
.
<EOS>
As
for
doubting
her
love
,
it
was
not
in
the
heart
of
the
man
to
do
so
after
it
had
been
once
assured
to
him
by
her
word
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
so
slightly
respect
himself
or
her
as
to
leave
room
for
such
a
doubt
in
his
bosom
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
man
who
could
never
have
suggested
to
himself
that
a
woman
loved
him
till
the
fact
was
there
before
him
;
but
who
having
ascertained
,
as
he
might
think
,
the
fact
,
could
never
suggest
to
himself
that
her
love
would
fail
him
.
<EOS>
Her
first
two
letters
from
Switzerland
had
been
very
pleasant
;
but
after
that
there
had
seemed
to
have
crept
over
her
a
melancholy
which
she
unconsciously
transferred
to
her
words
,
and
which
he
could
not
but
taste
in
them
,
 
at
first
unconsciously
,
also
,
but
soon
with
so
plain
a
flavour
that
he
recognised
it
,
and
made
it
a
matter
of
mental
inquiry

<EOS>
During
the
three
or
four
last
days
of
the
journey
,
while
they
were
at
Basle
and
on
their
way
home
,
she
had
not
written
.
<EOS>
But
she
did
write
on
the
day
after
her
arrival
,
having
then
received
from
Mr.
Grey
a
letter
,
in
which
he
told
her
how
very
much
she
would
add
to
his
happiness
if
she
would
now
agree
that
their
marriage
should
not
be
postponed
beyond
the
end
of
October
.
<EOS>
This
letter
she
found
in
her
room
on
her
return
,
and
this
she
answered
at
once
.
<EOS>
And
she
answered
it
in
such
words
that
Mr.
Grey
resolved
that
he
would
at
once
go
to
her
in
London
.
<EOS>
I
will
give
her
letter
at
length
,
as
I
shall
then
be
best
able
to
proceed
with
my
story
quickly
.

DEAREST
JOHN
,
    
<EOS>
We
reached
home
yesterday
tired
enough
,
as
we
came
through
from
Paris
without
stopping
.
<EOS>
I
may
indeed
say
that
we
came
through
from
Strasbourg
,
as
we
only
slept
in
Paris
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
like
Strasbourg
.
<EOS>
A
steeple
,
after
all
,
is
not
everything
,
and
putting
the
steeple
aside
,
I
do
n't
think
the
style
is
good
.
<EOS>
But
the
hotel
was
uncomfortable
,
which
goes
for
so
much
;
 
and
then
we
were
saturated
with
beauty
of
a
better
kind
.
  
<EOS>
I
got
your
letter
<EOS>
directly
I
came
in
last
night
,
and
I
suppose
I
had
better
dash
at
it
at
once
.
<EOS>
I
would
so
willingly
delay
doing
so
,
saying
nice
little
things
the
while
,
did
I
not
know
that
this
would
be
mere
cowardice
.
<EOS>
Whatever
happens
I
wo
n't
be
a
coward
,
and
therefore
I
will
tell
you
at
once
that
I
can
not
let
you
hope
that
we
should
be
married
this
year
.
<EOS>
Of
course
you
will
ask
me
why
,
as
you
have
a
right
to
do
,
and
of
course
I
am
bound
to
answer
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
that
I
can
give
any
answer
with
which
you
will
not
have
a
right
to
complain
.
<EOS>
If
it
be
so
,
I
can
only
ask
your
pardon
for
the
injury
I
am
doing
you
.
  
<EOS>
Marriage
is
a
great
change
in
life
,
 
much
greater
to
me
than
to
you
,
who
will
remain
in
your
old
house
,
will
keep
your
old
pursuits
,
will
still
be
your
own
master
,
and
will
change
in
nothing
,
 
except
in
this
,
that
you
will
have
a
companion
who
probably
may
not
be
all
that
you
expect
.
<EOS>
But
I
must
change
everything
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
to
me
as
though
I
were
passing
through
a
grave
to
a
new
world
.
<EOS>
I
shall
see
nothing
that
I
have
been
accustomed
to
see
,
and
must
abandon
all
the
ways
of
life
that
I
have
hitherto
adopted
.
<EOS>
Of
course
I
should
have
thought
of
this
before
I
accepted
you
;
and
I
did
think
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
made
up
my
mind
that
,
as
I
truly
loved
you
,
I
would
risk
the
change
;
 
that
I
would
risk
it
for
your
sake
and
for
mine
,
hoping
that
I
might
add
something
to
your
happiness
,
and
that
I
might
secure
my
own
.
<EOS>
Dear
John
,
do
not
suppose
that
I
despair
that
it
may
be
so
;
but
,
indeed
,
you
must
not
hurry
me
.
<EOS>
I
must
tune
myself
to
the
change
that
I
have
to
make
.
<EOS>
What
if
I
should
wake
some
morning
after
six
months
living
with
you
,
and
tell
you
that
the
quiet
of
your
home
was
making
me
mad
?
  
<EOS>
You
must
not
ask
me
again
till
the
winter
shall
have
passed
away
.
<EOS>
If
in
the
meantime
I
shall
find
that
I
have
been
wrong
,
I
will
humbly
confess
that
I
have
wronged
you
,
and
ask
you
to
forgive
me
.
<EOS>
And
I
will
freely
admit
this
.
<EOS>
If
the
delay
which
I
now
purpose
is
so
contrary
to
your
own
plans
as
to
make
your
marriage
,
under
such
circumstances
,
not
that
which
you
had
expected
,
I
know
that
you
are
free
to
tell
me
so
,
and
to
say
that
our
engagement
shall
be
over
.
<EOS>
I
am
well
aware
that
I
can
have
no
right
to
bind
you
to
a
marriage
at
one
period
which
you
had
only
contemplated
as
to
take
place
at
another
period
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
may
promise
that
I
will
obey
any
wish
you
may
express
in
anything
,
 
except
in
that
one
thing
which
you
urged
in
your
last
letter
.
  
<EOS>
Kate
is
going
down
to
Yarmouth
with
Mrs.
Greenow
,
and
I
shall
see
no
more
of
her
probably
till
next
year
,
as
she
will
be
due
in
Westmoreland
after
that
.
<EOS>
George
left
me
at
the
door
when
he
brought
me
home
,
and
declared
that
he
intended
to
vanish
out
of
London
.
<EOS>
Whether
in
town
or
out
,
he
is
never
to
be
seen
at
this
period
of
the
year
.
<EOS>
Papa
offers
to
go
to
Ramsgate
for
a
fortnight
,
but
he
looks
so
wretched
when
he
makes
the
offer
,
that
I
shall
not
have
the
heart
to
hold
him
to
it
.
<EOS>
Lady
Macleod
very
much
wants
me
to
go
to
Cheltenham
.
<EOS>
I
very
much
want
not
to
go
,
simply
because
I
can
never
agree
with
her
about
anything
;
but
it
will
probably
end
in
my
going
there
for
a
week
or
two
.
<EOS>
Over
and
beyond
that
,
I
have
no
prospects
before
Christmas
which
are
not
purely
domestic
.
<EOS>
There
is
a
project
that
we
shall
all
eat
our
Christmas
dinner
at
Vavasor
Hall
,
 
of
course
not
including
George
,
 
but
<EOS>
this
project
is
quite
in
the
clouds
,
and
,
as
far
as
I
am
concerned
,
will
remain
there
.
  
<EOS>
Dear
John
,
let
me
hear
that
this
letter
does
not
make
you
unhappy
.
  
<EOS>
Most
affectionately
yours
,
  
ALICE
VAVASOR
.
  
<EOS>
At
Nethercoats
,
the
post
was
brought
in
at
breakfast
-
time
,
and
Mr.
Grey
was
sitting
with
his
tea
and
eggs
before
him
,
when
he
read
Alice
's
letter
.
<EOS>
He
read
it
twice
before
he
began
to
think
what
he
would
do
in
regard
to
it
,
and
then
referred
to
one
or
two
others
which
he
had
received
from
Switzerland
,
 
reading
them
also
very
carefully
.
<EOS>
After
that
,
he
took
up
the
slouch
hat
which
he
had
been
wearing
in
the
garden
before
he
was
called
to
his
breakfast
,
and
,
with
the
letters
in
his
hand
,
sauntered
down
among
the
shrubs
and
lawns
.
  
<EOS>
He
knew
,
he
thought
he
knew
,
that
there
was
more
in
Alice
's
mind
than
a
mere
wish
for
delay
.
<EOS>
There
was
more
in
it
than
that
hesitation
to
take
at
once
a
step
which
she
really
desired
to
take
,
if
not
now
,
then
after
some
short
interval
.
<EOS>
He
felt
that
she
was
unhappy
,
and
unhappy
because
she
distrusted
the
results
of
her
marriage
;
but
it
never
for
a
moment
occurred
to
him
that
,
therefore
,
the
engagement
between
them
should
be
broken
.
<EOS>
In
the
first
place
he
loved
her
too
well
to
allow
of
his
admitting
such
an
idea
without
terrible
sorrow
to
himself
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
constant
,
firm
man
,
somewhat
reserved
,
and
unwilling
to
make
new
acquaintances
,
and
,
therefore
,
specially
unwilling
to
break
away
from
those
which
he
had
made
.
<EOS>
Undoubtedly
,
had
he
satisfied
himself
that
Alice
's
happiness
demanded
such
a
sacrifice
of
himself
,
he
would
have
made
it
,
and
made
it
without
a
word
of
complaint
.
<EOS>
The
blow
would
not
have
prostrated
him
,
but
the
bruise
would
have
remained
on
his
heart
,
indelible
,
not
to
be
healed
but
by
death
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
submitted
,
and
no
man
would
have
seen
that
he
had
been
injured
.
<EOS>
But
it
did
not
once
occur
to
him
that
such
a
proceeding
on
his
part
would
be
beneficial
to
Alice
.
<EOS>
Without
being
aware
of
it
,
he
reckoned
himself
to
be
the
nobler
creature
of
the
two
,
and
now
thought
of
her
as
of
one
wounded
,
and
wanting
a
cure
.
<EOS>
Some
weakness
had
fallen
on
her
,
and
strength
must
be
given
to
her
from
another
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
in
the
least
doubt
her
love
,
but
he
knew
that
she
had
been
associated
,
for
a
few
weeks
past
,
with
two
persons
whose
daily
conversation
would
be
prone
to
weaken
the
tone
of
her
mind
.
<EOS>
He
no
more
thought
of
giving
her
up
than
a
man
thinks
of
having
his
leg
cut
off
because
he
has
sprained
his
sinews
.
<EOS>
He
would
go
up
to
town
and
see
her
,
and
would
not
even
yet
abandon
all
hope
that
she
might
be
found
sitting
at
his
board
when
Christmas
should
come
.
<EOS>
By
that
day
's
post
he
wrote
a
short
note
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dearest
Alice
,
"
he
said
,
"
I
have
resolved
to
go
to
London
at
once
.
<EOS>
I
will
be
with
you
in
the
evening
at
eight
,
the
day
after
to
-
morrow
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yours
,
J.
G.
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
no
more
in
the
letter
than
that
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
now
,
"
she
said
,
when
she
received
it
,
"
I
must
dare
to
tell
him
the
whole
truth
.
"
   
<EOS>
John
Grey
Goes
to
London
.
 
<EOS>
And
what
was
the
whole
truth
?
<EOS>
Alice
Vavasor
,
when
she
declared
to
herself
that
she
must
tell
her
lover
the
whole
truth
,
was
expressing
to
herself
her
intention
of
putting
an
end
to
her
engagement
with
Mr.
Grey
.
<EOS>
She
was
acknowledging
that
that
which
had
to
be
told
was
not
compatible
with
the
love
and
perfect
faith
which
she
owed
to
the
man
who
was
her
affianced
husband
.
<EOS>
And
yet
,
why
should
it
be
so
?
<EOS>
She
did
not
intend
to
tell
him
that
she
had
been
false
in
her
love
to
him
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
that
her
heart
had
again
veered
itself
round
and
given
itself
to
that
wild
cousin
of
hers
.
<EOS>
Though
she
might
feel
herself
constrained
to
part
from
John
Grey
,
George
Vavasor
could
never
be
her
husband
.
<EOS>
Of
that
she
assured
herself
fifty
times
during
the
two
days
'
grace
which
had
been
allowed
her
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
she
went
farther
than
that
with
herself
,
and
pronounced
a
verdict
against
any
marriage
as
possible
to
her
if
she
now
decided
against
this
marriage
which
had
for
some
months
past
been
regarded
as
fixed
by
herself
and
all
her
friends
.
  
<EOS>
People
often
say
that
marriage
is
an
important
thing
,
and
should
be
much
thought
of
in
advance
,
and
marrying
people
are
cautioned
that
there
are
many
who
marry
in
haste
and
repent
at
leisure
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
sure
,
however
,
that
marriage
may
not
be
pondered
over
too
much
;
nor
do
I
feel
certain
that
the
leisurely
repentance
does
not
as
often
follow
the
leisurely
marriages
as
it
does
the
rapid
ones
.
<EOS>
That
some
repent
no
one
can
doubt
;
but
I
am
inclined
to
believe
that
most
men
and
women
take
their
lots
as
they
find
them
,
marrying
as
the
birds
do
by
force
of
nature
,
and
going
on
with
their
mates
with
a
general
,
though
not
perhaps
an
undisturbed
satisfaction
,
feeling
inwardly
assured
that
Providence
,
if
it
have
not
done
the
very
best
for
them
,
has
done
for
them
as
well
as
they
could
do
for
themselves
with
all
the
thought
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
that
a
woman
can
assure
to
herself
,
by
her
own
prudence
and
taste
,
a
good
husband
any
more
than
she
can
add
two
cubits
to
her
stature
;
but
husbands
have
been
made
to
be
decently
good
,
 
and
wives
too
,
for
the
most
part
,
in
our
country
,
 
so
that
the
thing
does
not
require
quite
so
much
thinking
as
some
people
say
.
  
<EOS>
That
Alice
Vavasor
had
thought
too
much
about
it
,
I
feel
quite
sure
.
<EOS>
She
had
gone
on
thinking
of
it
till
she
had
filled
herself
with
a
cloud
of
doubts
which
even
the
sunshine
of
love
was
unable
to
drive
from
her
heavens
.
<EOS>
That
a
girl
should
really
love
the
man
she
intends
to
marry
,
 
that
,
at
any
rate
,
may
be
admitted
.
<EOS>
But
love
generally
comes
easily
enough
.
<EOS>
With
all
her
doubts
Alice
never
doubted
her
love
for
Mr.
Grey
.
<EOS>
Nor
did
she
doubt
his
character
,
nor
his
temper
,
nor
his
means
.
<EOS>
But
she
had
gone
on
thinking
of
the
matter
till
her
mind
had
become
filled
with
some
undefined
idea
of
the
importance
to
her
of
her
own
life
.
<EOS>
What
should
a
woman
do
with
her
life
?
<EOS>
There
had
arisen
round
her
a
flock
of
learned
ladies
asking
that
question
,
to
whom
it
seems
that
the
proper
answer
has
never
yet
occurred
.
<EOS>
Fall
in
love
,
marry
the
man
,
have
two
children
,
and
live
happy
ever
afterwards
.
<EOS>
I
maintain
that
answer
has
as
much
wisdom
in
it
as
any
other
that
can
be
given
;
 
or
perhaps
more
.
<EOS>
The
advice
contained
in
it
can
not
,
perhaps
,
always
be
followed
to
the
letter
;
but
neither
can
the
advice
of
the
other
kind
,
which
is
given
by
the
flock
of
learned
ladies
who
ask
the
question
.
  
<EOS>
A
woman
's
life
is
important
to
her
,
 
as
is
that
of
a
man
to
him
,
 
not
chiefly
in
regard
to
that
which
she
shall
do
with
it
.
<EOS>
The
chief
thing
for
her
to
look
to
is
the
manner
in
which
that
something
shall
be
done
.
<EOS>
It
is
of
moment
to
a
young
man
when
entering
life
to
decide
whether
he
shall
make
hats
or
shoes
;
but
not
of
half
the
moment
that
will
be
that
other
decision
,
whether
he
shall
make
good
shoes
or
bad
.
<EOS>
And
so
with
a
woman
;
 
if
she
shall
have
recognised
the
necessity
of
truth
and
honesty
for
the
purposes
of
her
life
,
I
do
not
know
that
she
need
ask
herself
many
questions
as
to
what
she
will
do
with
it
.
  
<EOS>
Alice
Vavasor
was
ever
asking
herself
that
question
,
and
had
by
degrees
filled
herself
with
a
vague
idea
that
there
was
a
something
to
be
done
;
a
something
over
and
beyond
,
or
perhaps
altogether
beside
that
marrying
and
having
two
children
;
 
if
she
only
knew
what
it
was
.
<EOS>
She
had
filled
herself
,
or
had
been
filled
by
her
cousins
,
with
an
undefined
ambition
that
made
her
restless
without
giving
her
any
real
food
for
her
mind
.
<EOS>
When
she
told
herself
that
she
would
have
no
scope
for
action
in
that
life
in
Cambridgeshire
which
Mr.
Grey
was
preparing
for
her
,
she
did
not
herself
know
what
she
meant
by
action
.
<EOS>
Had
any
one
accused
her
of
being
afraid
to
separate
herself
from
London
society
,
she
would
have
declared
that
she
went
very
little
into
society
and
disliked
that
little
.
<EOS>
Had
it
been
whispered
to
her
that
she
loved
the
neighbourhood
of
the
shops
,
she
would
have
scorned
the
whisperer
.
<EOS>
Had
it
been
suggested
that
the
continued
rattle
of
the
big
city
was
necessary
to
her
happiness
,
she
would
have
declared
that
she
and
her
father
had
picked
out
for
their
residence
the
quietest
street
in
London
because
she
could
not
bear
noise
;
 
and
yet
she
told
herself
that
she
feared
to
be
taken
into
the
desolate
calmness
of
Cambridgeshire
.
  
<EOS>
When
she
did
contrive
to
find
any
answer
to
that
question
as
to
what
she
should
do
with
her
life
,
 
or
rather
what
she
would
wish
to
do
with
it
if
she
were
a
free
agent
,
it
was
generally
of
a
political
nature
.
<EOS>
She
was
not
so
far
advanced
as
to
think
that
women
should
be
lawyers
and
doctors
,
or
to
wish
that
she
might
have
the
privilege
of
the
franchise
for
herself
;
but
she
had
undoubtedly
a
hankering
after
some
second
-
hand
political
manoeuvering
.
<EOS>
She
would
have
liked
,
I
think
,
to
have
been
the
wife
of
the
leader
of
a
Radical
opposition
,
in
the
time
when
such
men
were
put
into
prison
,
and
to
have
kept
up
for
him
his
seditious
correspondence
while
he
lay
in
the
Tower
.
<EOS>
She
would
have
carried
the
answers
to
him
inside
her
stays
,
 
and
have
made
long
journeys
down
into
northern
parts
without
any
money
,
if
the
cause
required
it
.
<EOS>
She
would
have
liked
to
have
around
her
ardent
spirits
,
male
or
female
,
who
would
have
talked
of
"
the
cause
,
"
and
have
kept
alive
in
her
some
flame
of
political
fire
.
<EOS>
As
it
was
,
she
had
no
cause
.
<EOS>
Her
father
's
political
views
were
very
mild
.
<EOS>
Lady
Macleod
's
were
deadly
conservative
.
<EOS>
Kate
Vavasor
was
an
aspiring
Radical
just
now
,
because
her
brother
was
in
the
same
line
;
but
during
the
year
of
the
love
-
passages
between
George
and
Alice
,
George
Vavasor
's
politics
had
been
as
conservative
as
you
please
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
become
a
Radical
till
he
had
quarrelled
with
his
grandfather
.
<EOS>
Now
,
indeed
,
he
was
possessed
of
very
advanced
views
,
 
views
with
which
Alice
felt
that
she
could
sympathize
.
<EOS>
But
what
would
be
the
use
of
sympathizing
down
in
Cambridgeshire
?
<EOS>
John
Grey
had
,
so
to
speak
,
no
politics
.
<EOS>
He
had
decided
views
as
to
the
treatment
which
the
Roman
Senate
received
from
Augustus
,
and
had
even
discussed
with
Alice
the
conduct
of
the
Girondists
at
the
time
of
Robespierre
's
triumph
;
but
for
Manchester
and
its
cares
he
had
no
apparent
solicitude
,
and
had
declared
to
Alice
that
he
would
not
accept
a
seat
in
the
British
House
of
Commons
if
it
were
offered
to
him
free
of
expense
.
<EOS>
What
political
enthusiasm
could
she
indulge
with
such
a
companion
down
in
Cambridgeshire
?
  
<EOS>
She
thought
too
much
of
all
this
,
 
and
was
,
if
I
may
say
,
over
-
prudent
in
calculating
the
chances
of
her
happiness
and
of
his
.
<EOS>
For
,
to
give
her
credit
for
what
was
her
due
,
she
was
quite
as
anxious
on
the
latter
head
as
on
the
former
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
care
for
the
Roman
Senate
,
"
she
would
say
to
herself
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
care
much
for
the
Girondists
.
<EOS>
How
am
I
to
talk
to
him
day
after
day
,
night
after
night
,
when
we
shall
be
alone
together
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
No
doubt
her
tour
in
Switzerland
with
her
cousin
had
had
some
effect
in
making
such
thoughts
stronger
now
than
they
had
ever
been
.
<EOS>
She
had
not
again
learned
to
love
her
cousin
.
<EOS>
She
was
as
firmly
sure
as
ever
that
she
could
never
love
him
more
.
<EOS>
He
had
insulted
her
love
;
and
though
she
had
forgiven
him
and
again
enrolled
him
among
her
dearest
friends
,
she
could
never
again
feel
for
him
that
passion
which
a
woman
means
when
she
acknowledges
that
she
is
in
love
.
<EOS>
That
,
as
regarded
her
and
George
Vavasor
,
was
over
.
<EOS>
But
,
nevertheless
,
there
had
been
a
something
of
romance
during
those
days
in
Switzerland
which
she
feared
she
would
regret
when
she
found
herself
settled
at
Nethercoats
.
<EOS>
She
envied
Kate
.
<EOS>
Kate
could
,
as
his
sister
,
attach
herself
on
to
George
's
political
career
,
and
obtain
from
it
all
that
excitement
of
life
which
Alice
desired
for
herself
.
<EOS>
Alice
could
not
love
her
cousin
and
marry
him
;
but
she
felt
that
if
she
could
do
so
without
impropriety
she
would
like
to
stick
close
to
him
like
another
sister
,
to
spend
her
money
in
aiding
his
career
in
Parliament
as
Kate
would
do
,
and
trust
herself
and
her
career
into
the
boat
which
he
was
to
command
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
love
her
cousin
;
but
she
still
believed
in
him
,
 
with
a
faith
which
he
certainly
did
not
deserve
.
  
<EOS>
As
the
two
days
passed
over
her
,
her
mind
grew
more
and
more
fixed
as
to
its
purpose
.
<EOS>
She
would
tell
Mr.
Grey
that
she
was
not
fit
to
be
his
wife
 
<EOS>
and
she
would
beg
him
to
pardon
her
and
to
leave
her
.
<EOS>
It
never
occurred
to
her
that
perhaps
he
might
refuse
to
let
her
go
.
<EOS>
She
felt
quite
sure
that
she
would
be
free
as
soon
as
she
had
spoken
the
word
which
she
intended
to
speak
.
<EOS>
If
she
could
speak
it
with
decision
she
would
be
free
,
and
to
attain
that
decision
she
would
school
herself
with
her
utmost
strength
.
<EOS>
At
one
moment
she
thought
of
telling
all
to
her
father
and
of
begging
him
to
break
the
matter
to
Mr.
Grey
;
but
she
knew
that
her
father
would
not
understand
her
,
and
that
he
would
be
very
hostile
to
her
,
 
saying
hard
,
uncomfortable
words
,
which
would
probably
be
spared
if
the
thing
were
done
before
he
was
informed
.
<EOS>
Nor
would
she
write
to
Kate
,
whose
letters
to
her
at
this
time
were
full
of
wit
at
the
expense
of
Mrs.
Greenow
.
<EOS>
She
would
tell
Kate
as
soon
as
the
thing
was
done
,
but
not
before
.
<EOS>
That
Kate
would
sympathize
with
her
,
she
was
quite
certain
.
  
<EOS>
So
the
two
days
passed
by
and
the
time
came
at
which
John
Grey
was
to
be
there
.
<EOS>
As
the
minute
hand
on
the
drawing
-
room
clock
came
round
to
the
full
hour
,
she
felt
that
her
heart
was
beating
with
a
violence
which
she
could
not
repress
.
<EOS>
The
thing
seemed
to
her
to
assume
bigger
dimensions
than
it
had
hitherto
done
.
<EOS>
She
began
to
be
aware
that
she
was
about
to
be
guilty
of
a
great
iniquity
,
when
it
was
too
late
for
her
to
change
her
mind
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
bring
herself
to
resolve
that
she
would
,
on
the
moment
,
change
her
mind
.
<EOS>
She
believed
that
she
could
never
pardon
herself
such
weakness
.
<EOS>
But
yet
she
felt
herself
to
be
aware
that
her
purpose
was
wicked
.
<EOS>
When
the
knock
at
the
door
was
at
last
heard
she
trembled
and
feared
that
she
would
almost
be
unable
to
speak
to
him
.
<EOS>
Might
it
be
possible
that
there
should
yet
be
a
reprieve
for
her
?
<EOS>
No
;
it
was
his
step
on
the
stairs
,
and
there
he
was
in
the
room
with
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dearest
,
"
he
said
,
coming
to
her
.
<EOS>
His
smile
was
sweet
and
loving
as
it
ever
was
,
and
his
voice
had
its
usual
manly
,
genial
,
loving
tone
.
<EOS>
As
he
walked
across
the
room
Alice
felt
that
he
was
a
man
of
whom
a
wife
might
be
very
proud
.
<EOS>
He
was
tall
and
very
handsome
,
with
brown
hair
,
with
bright
blue
eyes
,
and
a
mouth
like
a
god
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
beauty
of
his
mouth
,
 
beauty
which
comprised
firmness
within
itself
,
that
made
Alice
afraid
of
him
.
<EOS>
He
was
still
dressed
in
his
morning
clothes
;
but
he
was
a
man
who
always
seemed
to
be
well
dressed
.
<EOS>
"
My
dearest
,
"
he
said
,
advancing
across
the
room
,
and
before
she
knew
how
to
stop
herself
or
him
,
he
had
taken
her
in
his
arms
and
kissed
her
.
  
<EOS>
He
did
not
immediately
begin
about
the
letter
,
but
placed
her
upon
the
sofa
,
seating
himself
by
her
side
,
and
looked
into
her
face
with
loving
eyes
,
 
not
as
though
to
scrutinize
what
might
be
amiss
there
,
but
as
though
determined
to
enjoy
to
the
full
his
privilege
as
a
lover
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
reproach
at
any
rate
in
his
countenance
;
 
none
as
yet
;
nor
did
it
seem
that
he
thought
that
he
had
any
cause
for
fear
.
<EOS>
They
sat
in
this
way
for
a
moment
or
two
in
silence
,
and
during
those
moments
Alice
was
summoning
up
her
courage
to
speak
.
<EOS>
The
palpitation
at
her
heart
was
already
gone
,
and
she
was
determined
that
she
would
speak
.
  
<EOS>
"
Though
I
am
very
glad
to
see
you
,
"
she
said
,
at
last
,
"
I
am
sorry
that
my
letter
should
have
given
you
the
trouble
of
this
journey
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Trouble
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
you
ought
to
know
that
it
is
no
trouble
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
enough
to
do
down
at
Nethercoats
to
make
the
running
up
to
you
at
any
time
an
unpleasant
excitement
.
<EOS>
So
your
Swiss
journey
went
off
pleasantly
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
it
went
off
very
pleasantly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
This
she
said
in
that
tone
of
voice
which
clearly
implies
that
the
speaker
is
not
thinking
of
the
words
spoken
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
Kate
has
now
left
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
she
is
with
her
aunt
,
at
the
seaside
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
So
I
understand
;
 
and
your
cousin
George
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
know
much
of
George
's
movements
.
<EOS>
He
may
be
in
Town
,
but
I
have
not
seen
him
since
I
came
back
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
that
is
the
way
with
friends
living
in
London
.
<EOS>
Unless
circumstances
bring
them
together
,
they
are
in
fact
further
apart
than
if
they
lived
fifty
miles
asunder
in
the
country
.
<EOS>
And
he
managed
to
get
through
all
the
trouble
without
losing
your
luggage
for
you
very
often
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
were
to
say
that
we
did
not
lose
his
,
that
would
be
nearer
the
mark
.
<EOS>
But
,
John
,
you
have
come
up
to
London
in
this
sudden
way
to
speak
to
me
about
my
letter
to
you
.
<EOS>
Is
it
not
so
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Certainly
it
is
so
.
<EOS>
Certainly
I
have
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
thought
much
,
since
,
of
what
I
then
wrote
,
very
much
,
 
very
much
,
indeed
;
and
I
have
learned
to
feel
sure
that
we
had
better
 
"
  
"
Stop
,
Alice
;
stop
a
moment
,
love
.
<EOS>
Do
not
speak
hurriedly
.
<EOS>
Shall
I
tell
you
what
I
learned
from
your
letter
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Yes
;
tell
me
,
if
you
think
it
better
that
you
should
do
so
.
"
  
"
Perhaps
it
may
be
better
.
<EOS>
I
learned
,
love
,
that
something
had
been
said
or
done
during
your
journey
,
 
or
perhaps
only
something
thought
,
that
had
made
you
melancholy
,
and
filled
your
mind
for
a
while
with
those
unsubstantial
and
indefinable
regrets
for
the
past
which
we
are
all
apt
to
feel
at
certain
moments
of
our
life
.
<EOS>
There
are
few
of
us
who
do
not
encounter
,
now
and
again
,
some
of
that
irrational
spirit
of
sadness
which
,
when
over
-
indulged
,
drives
men
to
madness
and
self
-
destruction
.
<EOS>
I
used
to
know
well
what
it
was
before
I
knew
you
;
but
since
I
have
had
the
hope
of
having
you
in
my
house
,
I
have
banished
it
utterly
.
<EOS>
In
that
I
think
I
have
been
stronger
than
you
.
<EOS>
Do
not
speak
under
the
influence
of
that
spirit
till
you
have
thought
whether
you
,
too
,
can
not
banish
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
tried
,
and
it
will
not
be
banished
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Try
again
,
Alice
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
damned
spirit
,
and
belongs
neither
to
heaven
nor
to
earth
.
<EOS>
Do
not
say
to
me
the
words
that
you
were
about
to
say
till
you
have
wrestled
with
it
manfully
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
know
what
those
words
were
to
be
.
<EOS>
If
you
love
me
,
those
words
should
not
be
spoken
.
<EOS>
If
you
do
not
 
"
  
"
If
I
do
not
love
you
,
I
love
no
one
upon
earth
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
it
.
<EOS>
I
believe
it
as
I
believe
in
my
own
love
for
you
.
<EOS>
I
trust
your
love
implicitly
,
Alice
.
<EOS>
I
know
that
you
love
me
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
can
read
your
mind
.
<EOS>
Tell
me
that
I
may
return
to
Cambridgeshire
,
and
again
plead
my
cause
for
an
early
marriage
from
thence
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
take
such
speech
from
you
to
mean
more
than
it
says
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
sat
quiet
,
looking
at
him
 
looking
full
into
his
face
.
<EOS>
She
had
in
nowise
changed
her
mind
,
but
after
such
words
from
him
,
she
did
not
know
how
to
declare
to
him
her
resolution
.
<EOS>
There
was
something
in
his
manner
that
awed
her
,
 
and
something
also
that
softened
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Tell
me
,
"
said
he
,
"
that
I
may
see
you
again
to
-
morrow
morning
in
our
usual
quiet
,
loving
way
,
and
that
I
may
return
home
to
-
morrow
evening
.
<EOS>
Pronounce
a
yea
to
that
speech
from
me
,
and
I
will
ask
for
nothing
further
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
I
can
not
do
so
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
And
the
tone
of
her
voice
,
as
she
spoke
,
was
different
to
any
tone
that
he
had
heard
before
from
her
mouth
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
that
melancholy
fiend
too
strong
for
you
?
"
<EOS>
He
smiled
as
he
said
this
,
and
as
he
smiled
,
he
took
her
hand
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
attempt
to
withdraw
it
,
but
sat
by
him
in
a
strange
calmness
,
looking
straight
before
her
into
the
middle
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
not
struggled
with
it
.
<EOS>
You
know
,
as
I
do
,
that
it
is
a
bad
fiend
and
a
wicked
one
,
 
a
fiend
that
is
prompting
you
to
the
worst
cruelty
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
Alice
!
<EOS>
Alice
!
<EOS>
Alice
!
<EOS>
Try
to
think
of
all
this
as
though
some
other
person
were
concerned
.
<EOS>
If
it
were
your
friend
,
what
advice
would
you
give
her
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
bid
her
tell
the
man
who
had
loved
her
,
 
<EOS>
that
is
,
if
he
were
noble
,
good
,
and
great
,
 
that
she
found
herself
to
be
unfit
to
be
his
wife
;
and
then
I
would
bid
her
ask
his
pardon
humbly
on
her
knees
.
<EOS>
"
As
she
said
this
,
she
sank
before
him
on
to
the
floor
,
and
looked
up
into
his
face
with
an
expression
of
sad
contrition
which
almost
drew
him
from
his
purposed
firmness
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
purposed
to
be
firm
,
 
to
yield
to
her
in
nothing
,
resolving
to
treat
all
that
she
might
say
as
the
hallucination
of
a
sickened
imagination
,
 
as
the
effect
of
absolute
want
of
health
,
for
which
some
change
in
her
mode
of
life
would
be
the
best
cure
.
<EOS>
She
might
bid
him
begone
in
what
language
she
would
.
<EOS>
He
knew
well
that
such
was
her
intention
.
<EOS>
But
he
would
not
allow
a
word
coming
from
her
in
such
a
way
to
disturb
arrangements
made
for
the
happiness
of
their
joint
lives
.
<EOS>
As
a
loving
husband
would
treat
a
wife
,
who
,
in
some
exceptionable
moment
of
a
melancholy
malady
,
should
declare
herself
unable
to
remain
longer
in
her
home
,
so
would
he
treat
her
.
<EOS>
As
for
accepting
what
she
might
say
as
his
dismissal
,
he
would
as
soon
think
of
taking
the
fruit
-
trees
from
the
southern
wall
because
the
sun
sometimes
shines
from
the
north
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
treat
either
his
interests
or
hers
so
lightly
as
that
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
what
if
he
granted
no
such
pardon
,
Alice
?
<EOS>
I
will
grant
none
such
.
<EOS>
You
are
my
wife
,
my
own
,
my
dearest
,
my
chosen
one
.
<EOS>
You
are
all
that
I
value
in
the
world
,
my
treasure
and
my
comfort
,
my
earthly
happiness
and
my
gleam
of
something
better
that
is
to
come
hereafter
.
<EOS>
Do
you
think
that
I
shall
let
you
go
from
me
in
that
way
?
<EOS>
No
,
love
.
<EOS>
If
you
are
ill
I
will
wait
till
your
illness
is
gone
by
;
and
,
if
you
will
let
me
,
I
will
be
your
nurse
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
ill
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
ill
with
any
defined
sickness
.
<EOS>
You
do
not
shake
with
ague
,
nor
does
your
head
rack
you
with
aching
;
but
yet
you
may
be
ill
.
<EOS>
Think
of
what
has
passed
between
us
.
<EOS>
Must
you
not
be
ill
when
you
seek
to
put
an
end
to
all
that
without
any
cause
assigned
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
not
hear
my
reasons
,
"
 
she
was
still
kneeling
before
him
and
looking
up
into
his
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
hear
them
if
you
will
tell
me
that
they
refer
to
any
supposed
faults
of
my
own
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
no
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
I
will
not
hear
them
.
<EOS>
It
is
for
me
to
find
out
your
faults
,
and
when
I
have
found
out
any
that
require
complaint
,
I
will
come
and
make
it
.
<EOS>
Dear
Alice
,
I
wish
you
knew
how
I
long
for
you
.
"
<EOS>
Then
he
put
his
hand
upon
her
hair
,
as
though
he
would
caress
her
.
  
<EOS>
But
this
she
would
not
suffer
,
so
she
rose
slowly
,
and
stood
with
her
hand
upon
the
table
in
the
middle
of
the
room
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Grey
 
<EOS>
"
she
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
will
call
me
so
,
I
shall
think
it
only
a
part
of
your
malady
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Grey
,
"
she
continued
,
"
I
can
only
hope
that
you
will
take
me
at
my
word
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
but
I
will
not
;
certainly
I
will
not
,
if
that
would
be
adverse
to
my
own
interests
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
thinking
of
your
interests
;
I
am
,
indeed
;
 
at
any
rate
as
much
as
of
my
own
.
<EOS>
I
feel
quite
sure
that
I
should
not
make
you
happy
as
your
wife
,
 
quite
sure
;
and
feeling
that
,
I
think
that
I
am
right
,
even
after
all
that
has
passed
,
to
ask
your
forgiveness
,
and
to
beg
that
our
engagement
may
be
over
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
Alice
,
no
;
never
with
my
consent
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
tell
you
with
what
contentment
I
would
marry
you
to
-
morrow
,
 
to
-
morrow
,
or
next
month
,
or
the
month
after
.
<EOS>
But
if
it
can
not
be
so
,
then
I
will
wait
.
<EOS>
Nothing
but
your
marriage
with
some
one
else
would
convince
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
convince
you
in
that
way
,
"
she
said
,
smiling
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
convince
me
in
no
other
.
<EOS>
You
have
not
spoken
to
your
father
of
this
as
yet
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Not
as
yet
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
not
do
so
,
at
any
rate
for
the
present
.
<EOS>
You
will
own
that
it
might
be
possible
that
you
would
have
to
unsay
what
you
had
said
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
it
is
not
possible
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Give
yourself
and
me
the
chance
.
<EOS>
It
can
do
no
harm
.
<EOS>
And
,
Alice
,
I
ask
you
now
for
no
reasons
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
ask
your
reasons
,
or
even
listen
to
them
,
because
I
do
not
believe
that
they
will
long
have
effect
even
on
yourself
.
<EOS>
Do
you
still
think
of
going
to
Cheltenham
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
decided
nothing
as
yet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
were
you
,
I
would
go
.
<EOS>
I
think
a
change
of
air
would
be
good
for
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
you
treat
me
as
though
I
were
partly
silly
,
and
partly
insane
;
but
it
is
not
so
.
<EOS>
The
change
you
speak
of
should
be
in
my
nature
,
and
in
yours
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
shook
his
head
and
still
smiled
.
<EOS>
There
was
something
in
the
imperturbed
security
of
his
manner
which
almost
made
her
angry
with
him
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
as
though
he
assumed
so
great
a
superiority
that
he
felt
himself
able
to
treat
any
resolve
of
hers
as
the
petulance
of
a
child
.
<EOS>
And
though
he
spoke
in
strong
language
of
his
love
,
and
of
his
longing
that
she
should
come
to
him
,
yet
he
was
so
well
able
to
command
his
feelings
,
that
he
showed
no
sign
of
grief
at
the
communication
she
had
made
to
him
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
doubt
his
love
,
but
she
believed
him
to
be
so
much
the
master
of
his
love
,
 
as
he
was
the
master
of
everything
else
,
that
her
separation
from
him
would
cause
him
no
uncontrollable
grief
.
<EOS>
In
that
she
utterly
failed
to
understand
his
character
.
<EOS>
Had
she
known
him
better
,
she
might
have
been
sure
that
such
a
separation
now
would
with
him
have
carried
its
mark
to
the
grave
.
<EOS>
Should
he
submit
to
her
decision
,
he
would
go
home
and
settle
himself
to
his
books
the
next
day
;
but
on
no
following
day
would
he
be
again
capable
of
walking
forth
among
his
flowers
with
an
easy
heart
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
strong
,
constant
man
,
perhaps
over
-
conscious
of
his
own
strength
;
but
then
his
strength
was
great
.
"
<EOS>
He
is
perfect
!
"
<EOS>
Alice
had
said
to
herself
often
.
<EOS>
"
Oh
that
he
were
less
perfect
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
did
not
stay
with
her
long
after
the
last
word
that
has
been
recorded
.
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
,
"
he
said
,
as
for
a
moment
he
held
her
hand
at
parting
,
"
I
had
better
not
come
to
-
morrow
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
;
it
is
better
not
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
advise
you
not
to
tell
your
father
of
this
,
and
doubtless
you
will
think
of
it
before
you
do
so
.
<EOS>
But
if
you
do
tell
him
,
let
me
know
that
you
have
done
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
that
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Because
in
such
case
I
also
must
see
him
.
<EOS>
God
bless
you
,
Alice
!
<EOS>
God
bless
you
,
dearest
,
dearest
Alice
!
"
<EOS>
Then
he
went
,
and
she
sat
there
on
the
sofa
without
moving
,
till
she
heard
her
father
's
feet
as
he
came
up
the
stairs
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
,
Alice
,
are
you
not
in
bed
yet
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
yet
,
papa
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
so
John
Grey
has
been
here
.
<EOS>
He
has
left
his
stick
in
the
hall
.
<EOS>
I
should
know
it
among
a
thousand
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
he
has
been
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
anything
the
matter
,
Alice
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
papa
,
nothing
is
the
matter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
has
not
made
himself
disagreeable
,
has
he
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Not
in
the
least
.
<EOS>
He
never
does
anything
wrong
.
<EOS>
He
may
defy
man
or
woman
to
find
fault
with
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
So
that
is
it
,
is
it
?
<EOS>
He
is
just
a
shade
too
good
.
<EOS>
Well
,
I
have
always
thought
that
myself
.
<EOS>
But
it
's
a
fault
on
the
right
side
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
no
fault
,
Papa
.
<EOS>
If
there
be
any
fault
,
it
is
not
with
him
.
<EOS>
But
I
am
yawning
and
tired
,
and
I
will
go
to
bed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
he
to
be
here
to
-
morrow
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
he
returns
to
Nethercoats
early
.
<EOS>
Good
night
,
papa
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Vavasor
,
as
he
went
up
to
his
bedroom
,
felt
sure
that
there
had
been
something
wrong
between
his
daughter
and
her
lover
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
how
she
'll
ever
put
up
with
him
,
"
he
said
to
himself
,
"
he
is
so
terribly
conceited
.
<EOS>
I
shall
never
forget
how
he
went
on
about
Charles
Kemble
,
and
what
a
fool
he
made
of
himself
.
"
  
<EOS>
Alice
,
before
she
went
to
bed
,
sat
down
and
wrote
a
letter
to
her
cousin
Kate
.
   
<EOS>
Mr.
George
Vavasor
at
Home
.
 
<EOS>
It
can
not
perhaps
fairly
be
said
that
George
Vavasor
was
an
unhospitable
man
,
seeing
that
it
was
his
custom
to
entertain
his
friends
occasionally
at
Greenwich
,
Richmond
,
or
such
places
;
and
he
would
now
and
again
have
a
friend
to
dine
with
him
at
his
club
.
<EOS>
But
he
never
gave
breakfasts
,
dinners
,
or
suppers
under
his
own
roof
.
<EOS>
During
a
short
period
of
his
wine
-
selling
career
,
at
which
time
he
had
occupied
handsome
rooms
over
his
place
of
business
in
New
Burlington
Street
,
he
had
presided
at
certain
feasts
given
to
customers
or
expectant
customers
by
the
firm
;
but
he
had
not
found
this
employment
to
his
taste
,
and
had
soon
relinquished
it
to
one
of
the
other
partners
.
<EOS>
Since
that
he
had
lived
in
lodgings
in
Cecil
Street
,
 
down
at
the
bottom
of
that
retired
nook
,
near
to
the
river
and
away
from
the
Strand
.
<EOS>
Here
he
had
simply
two
rooms
on
the
first
floor
,
and
hither
his
friends
came
to
him
very
rarely
.
<EOS>
They
came
very
rarely
on
any
account
.
<EOS>
A
stray
man
might
now
and
then
pass
an
hour
with
him
here
;
but
on
such
occasions
the
chances
were
that
the
visit
had
some
reference
,
near
or
distant
,
to
affairs
of
business
.
<EOS>
Eating
or
drinking
there
was
never
any
to
be
found
here
by
the
most
intimate
of
his
allies
.
<EOS>
His
lodgings
were
his
private
retreat
,
and
they
were
so
private
that
<EOS>
but
few
of
his
friends
knew
where
he
lived
.
  
<EOS>
And
had
it
been
possible
<EOS>
he
would
have
wished
that
no
one
should
have
known
his
whereabouts
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
aware
that
he
had
any
special
reason
for
this
peculiarity
,
or
that
there
was
anything
about
his
mode
of
life
that
required
hiding
;
but
he
was
a
man
who
had
always
lived
as
though
secrecy
in
certain
matters
might
at
any
time
become
useful
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
had
a
mode
of
dressing
himself
when
he
went
out
at
night
that
made
it
almost
impossible
that
any
one
should
recognise
him
.
<EOS>
The
people
at
his
lodgings
did
not
even
know
that
he
had
relatives
,
and
his
nearest
relatives
hardly
knew
that
he
had
lodgings
.
<EOS>
Even
Kate
had
never
been
at
the
rooms
in
Cecil
Street
,
and
addressed
all
her
letters
to
his
place
of
business
or
his
club
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
man
who
would
bear
no
inquiry
into
himself
.
<EOS>
If
he
had
been
out
of
view
for
a
month
,
and
his
friends
asked
him
where
he
had
been
,
he
always
answered
the
question
falsely
,
or
left
it
unanswered
.
<EOS>
There
are
many
men
of
whom
everybody
knows
all
about
all
their
belongings
;
 
as
to
whom
everybody
knows
where
they
live
,
whither
they
go
<EOS>
,
what
is
their
means
,
and
how
they
spend
it
.
<EOS>
But
there
are
others
of
whom
no
man
knows
anything
,
and
George
Vavasor
was
such
a
one
.
<EOS>
For
myself
I
like
the
open
babbler
the
best
.
<EOS>
Babbling
may
be
a
weakness
,
but
to
my
thinking
mystery
is
a
vice
.
  
<EOS>
Vavasor
also
maintained
another
little
establishment
,
down
in
Oxfordshire
;
but
the
two
establishments
did
not
even
know
of
each
other
's
existence
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
third
,
too
,
very
closely
hidden
from
the
world
's
eye
,
which
shall
be
nameless
;
but
of
the
establishment
in
Oxfordshire
he
did
sometimes
speak
,
in
very
humble
words
,
among
his
friends
.
<EOS>
When
he
found
himself
among
hunting
men
,
he
would
speak
of
his
two
nags
at
Roebury
,
saying
that
he
had
never
yet
been
able
to
mount
a
regular
hunting
stable
,
and
that
he
supposed
he
never
would
;
but
that
there
were
at
Roebury
two
indifferent
beasts
of
his
if
any
one
chose
to
buy
them
.
<EOS>
And
men
very
often
did
buy
Vavasor
's
horses
.
<EOS>
When
he
was
on
them
they
always
went
well
and
sold
themselves
readily
.
<EOS>
And
though
he
thus
spoke
of
two
,
and
perhaps
did
not
keep
more
during
the
summer
,
he
always
seemed
to
have
horses
enough
when
he
was
down
in
the
country
.
<EOS>
No
one
even
knew
George
Vavasor
not
to
hunt
because
he
was
short
of
stuff
.
<EOS>
And
here
,
at
Roebury
,
he
kept
a
trusty
servant
,
an
ancient
groom
with
two
little
bushy
grey
eyes
which
looked
as
though
they
could
see
through
a
stable
door
.
<EOS>
Many
were
the
long
whisperings
which
George
and
Bat
Smithers
carried
on
at
the
stable
door
,
in
the
very
back
depth
of
the
yard
attached
to
the
hunting
inn
at
Roebury
.
<EOS>
Bat
regarded
his
master
as
a
man
wholly
devoted
to
horses
,
but
often
wondered
why
he
was
not
more
regular
in
his
sojournings
in
Oxfordshire
.
<EOS>
Of
any
other
portion
of
his
master
's
life
Bat
knew
nothing
.
<EOS>
Bat
could
give
the
address
of
his
master
's
club
in
London
,
but
he
could
give
no
other
address
.
  
<EOS>
But
though
Vavasor
's
private
lodgings
were
so
very
private
,
he
had
,
nevertheless
,
taken
some
trouble
in
adorning
them
.
<EOS>
The
furniture
in
the
sitting
-
room
was
very
neat
,
and
the
book
-
shelves
were
filled
with
volumes
that
shone
with
gilding
on
their
backs
.
<EOS>
The
inkstand
,
the
paper
-
weight
,
the
envelope
case
on
his
writing
-
table
were
all
handsome
.
<EOS>
He
had
a
single
good
portrait
of
a
woman
's
head
hanging
on
one
of
his
walls
.
<EOS>
He
had
a
special
place
adapted
for
his
pistols
,
others
for
his
foils
,
and
again
another
for
his
whips
.
<EOS>
The
room
was
as
pretty
a
bachelor
's
room
as
you
would
wish
to
enter
,
but
you
might
see
,
by
the
position
of
the
single
easy
-
chair
that
was
brought
forward
,
that
it
was
seldom
appropriated
to
the
comfort
of
more
than
one
person
.
<EOS>
Here
he
sat
lounging
over
his
breakfast
,
late
on
a
Sunday
morning
in
September
,
when
all
the
world
was
out
of
town
.
<EOS>
He
was
reading
a
letter
which
had
just
been
brought
down
to
him
from
his
club
.
<EOS>
Though
the
writer
of
it
was
his
sister
Kate
,
she
had
not
been
privileged
to
address
it
to
his
private
lodgings
.
<EOS>
He
read
it
very
quickly
,
running
rapidly
over
its
contents
,
and
then
threw
it
aside
from
him
as
though
it
were
of
no
moment
,
keeping
,
however
,
an
enclosure
in
his
hand
.
<EOS>
And
yet
the
letter
was
of
much
moment
,
and
made
him
think
deeply
.
<EOS>
"
If
I
did
it
at
all
,
"
said
he
,
"
it
would
be
more
with
the
object
of
cutting
him
out
than
with
any
other
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
reader
will
hardly
require
to
be
told
that
the
him
in
question
was
John
Grey
,
and
that
Kate
's
letter
was
one
instigating
her
brother
to
renew
his
love
affair
with
Alice
.
<EOS>
And
Vavasor
was
in
truth
well
inclined
to
renew
it
,
and
would
have
begun
the
renewing
it
at
once
,
had
he
not
doubted
his
power
with
his
cousin
.
<EOS>
Indeed
it
has
been
seen
that
he
had
already
attempted
some
commencement
of
such
renewal
at
Basle
.
<EOS>
He
had
told
Kate
more
than
once
that
Alice
's
fortune
was
not
much
,
and
that
her
beauty
was
past
its
prime
;
and
he
would
no
doubt
repeat
the
same
objections
to
his
sister
with
some
pretence
of
disinclination
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
his
custom
to
show
his
hand
to
the
players
at
any
game
that
he
played
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
,
in
truth
,
very
anxious
to
obtain
from
Alice
a
second
promise
of
her
hand
.
<EOS>
How
soon
after
that
he
might
marry
her
,
would
be
another
question
.
  
<EOS>
Perhaps
it
was
not
Alice
's
beauty
that
he
coveted
,
nor
yet
her
money
exclusively
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
he
thought
her
very
beautiful
,
and
was
fully
aware
that
her
money
would
be
of
great
service
to
him
.
<EOS>
But
I
believe
that
he
was
true
in
that
word
that
he
spoke
to
himself
,
and
that
his
chief
attraction
was
the
delight
which
he
would
have
in
robbing
Mr.
Grey
of
his
wife
.
<EOS>
Alice
had
once
been
his
love
,
had
clung
to
his
side
,
had
whispered
love
to
him
,
and
he
had
enough
of
the
weakness
of
humanity
in
him
to
feel
the
soreness
arising
from
her
affection
for
another
.
<EOS>
When
she
broke
away
from
him
he
had
acknowledged
that
he
had
been
wrong
,
and
when
,
since
her
engagement
with
Mr.
Grey
,
he
had
congratulated
her
,
he
had
told
her
in
his
quiet
,
half
-
whispered
,
impressive
words
how
right
she
was
;
but
not
the
less
,
therefore
,
did
he
feel
himself
hurt
that
John
Grey
should
be
her
lover
.
<EOS>
And
when
he
had
met
this
man
he
had
spoken
well
of
him
to
his
sister
,
saying
that
he
was
a
gentleman
,
a
scholar
,
and
a
man
of
parts
;
but
not
the
less
had
he
hated
him
from
the
first
moment
of
his
seeing
him
.
<EOS>
Such
hatred
under
such
circumstances
was
almost
pardonable
.
<EOS>
But
George
Vavasor
,
when
he
hated
,
was
apt
to
follow
up
his
hatred
with
injury
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
violently
dislike
a
man
and
yet
not
wish
to
do
him
any
harm
.
<EOS>
At
present
,
as
he
sat
lounging
in
his
chair
,
he
thought
that
he
would
like
to
marry
his
cousin
Alice
;
but
he
was
quite
sure
that
he
would
like
to
be
the
means
of
putting
a
stop
to
the
proposed
marriage
between
Alice
and
John
Grey
.
  
<EOS>
Kate
had
been
very
false
to
her
friend
,
and
had
sent
up
to
her
brother
the
very
letter
which
Alice
had
written
to
her
after
that
meeting
in
Queen
Anne
Street
which
was
described
in
the
last
chapter
,
 
or
rather
a
portion
of
it
,
for
with
the
reserve
common
to
women
she
had
kept
back
the
other
half
.
<EOS>
Alice
had
declared
to
herself
that
she
would
be
sure
of
her
cousin
's
sympathy
,
and
had
written
out
all
her
heart
on
the
matter
,
as
was
her
<EOS>
wo
nt
when
writing
to
Kate
.
<EOS>
"
But
you
must
understand
,
"
she
wrote
,
"
that
all
that
I
said
to
him
went
with
him
for
nothing
.
<EOS>
I
had
determined
to
make
him
know
that
everything
between
us
must
be
over
,
but
I
failed
.
<EOS>
I
found
that
I
had
no
words
at
command
,
but
that
he
was
able
to
talk
to
me
as
though
I
were
a
child
.
<EOS>
He
told
me
that
I
was
sick
and
full
of
phantasies
,
and
bade
me
change
the
air
.
<EOS>
As
he
spoke
in
this
way
,
I
could
not
help
feeling
how
right
he
was
to
use
me
so
;
but
I
felt
also
that
he
,
in
his
mighty
superiority
,
could
never
be
a
fitting
husband
for
a
creature
so
inferior
to
him
as
I
am
.
<EOS>
Though
I
altogether
failed
to
make
him
understand
that
it
was
so
,
every
moment
that
we
were
together
made
me
more
fixed
in
my
resolution
.
"
  
<EOS>
This
letter
from
Alice
to
Kate
,
Vavasor
read
over
and
over
again
,
though
Kate
's
letter
to
himself
,
which
was
the
longer
one
,
he
had
thrown
aside
after
the
first
glance
.
<EOS>
There
was
nothing
that
he
could
learn
from
that
.
<EOS>
He
was
as
good
a
judge
of
the
manner
in
which
he
would
play
his
own
game
as
Kate
could
be
;
but
in
this
matter
he
was
to
learn
how
he
would
play
his
game
from
a
knowledge
of
the
other
girl
's
mind
.
<EOS>
"
She
'll
never
marry
him
,
at
any
rate
,
"
he
said
to
himself
,
"
and
she
is
right
.
<EOS>
He
'd
make
an
upper
servant
of
her
;
very
respectable
,
no
doubt
,
but
still
only
an
upper
servant
.
<EOS>
Now
with
me
;
 
<EOS>
well
,
I
hardly
know
what
I
should
make
of
her
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
think
of
myself
as
a
man
married
.
<EOS>
"
Then
he
threw
her
letter
after
Kate
's
,
and
betook
himself
to
his
newspaper
and
his
cigar
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
two
hours
after
this
,
and
he
still
wore
his
dressing
-
gown
,
and
he
was
still
lounging
in
his
easy
-
chair
,
when
the
waiting
-
maid
at
the
lodgings
brought
him
up
word
that
a
gentleman
wished
to
see
him
.
<EOS>
Vavasor
kept
no
servant
of
his
own
except
that
confidential
groom
down
at
Bicester
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
rule
with
him
that
people
could
be
better
served
and
cheaper
served
by
other
people
's
servants
than
by
their
own
.
<EOS>
Even
in
the
stables
at
Bicester
<EOS>
the
innkeeper
had
to
find
what
assistance
was
wanted
,
and
charge
for
it
in
the
bill
.
<EOS>
And
George
Vavasor
was
no
Sybarite
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
deem
it
impracticable
to
put
on
his
own
trousers
without
having
a
man
standing
at
his
foot
to
hold
up
the
leg
of
the
garment
.
<EOS>
A
valet
about
a
man
knows
a
great
deal
of
a
man
's
ways
,
and
therefore
George
had
no
valet
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
gentleman
!
<EOS>
"
said
he
to
the
girl
.
<EOS>
"
Does
the
gentleman
look
like
a
public
-
house
keeper
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
think
he
do
,
"
said
the
girl
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
show
him
up
,
"
said
George
.
  
<EOS>
And
the
gentleman
was
a
public
-
house
keeper
.
<EOS>
Vavasor
was
pretty
sure
of
his
visitor
before
he
desired
the
servant
to
give
him
entrance
.
<EOS>
It
was
Mr.
Grimes
from
the
"
Handsome
Man
"
public
-
house
and
tavern
,
in
the
Brompton
Road
,
and
he
had
come
by
appointment
to
have
a
little
conversation
with
Mr.
Vavasor
on
matters
political
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Grimes
was
a
man
who
knew
that
business
was
business
,
and
as
such
had
some
considerable
weight
in
his
own
neighbourhood
.
<EOS>
With
him
politics
was
business
,
as
well
as
beer
,
and
omnibus
-
horses
,
and
foreign
wines
;
 
in
the
fabrication
of
which
latter
article
<EOS>
Mr.
Grimes
was
supposed
to
have
an
extended
experience
.
<EOS>
To
such
as
him
,
when
intent
on
business
,
Mr.
Vavasor
was
not
averse
to
make
known
the
secrets
of
his
lodging
-
house
;
and
now
,
when
the
idle
of
London
world
was
either
at
morning
church
or
still
in
bed
,
Mr.
Grimes
had
come
out
by
appointment
to
do
a
little
political
business
with
the
lately
-
rejected
member
for
the
Chelsea
Districts
.
  
<EOS>
Vavasor
had
been
,
as
I
have
said
,
lately
rejected
,
and
the
new
member
who
had
beaten
him
at
the
hustings
had
sat
now
for
one
session
in
parliament
.
<EOS>
Under
his
present
reign
he
was
destined
to
the
honour
of
one
other
session
,
and
then
the
period
of
his
existing
glory
,
 
for
which
he
was
said
to
have
paid
nearly
six
thousand
pounds
,
 
would
be
over
.
<EOS>
But
he
might
be
elected
again
,
perhaps
for
a
full
period
of
six
sessions
;
and
it
might
be
hoped
that
this
second
election
would
be
conducted
on
more
economical
principles
.
<EOS>
To
this
,
the
economical
view
of
the
matter
,
Mr.
Grimes
was
very
much
opposed
,
and
was
now
waiting
upon
George
Vavasor
in
Cecil
Street
,
chiefly
with
the
object
of
opposing
the
new
member
's
wishes
on
this
head
.
<EOS>
No
doubt
Mr.
Grimes
was
personally
an
advocate
for
the
return
of
Mr.
Vavasor
,
and
would
do
all
in
his
power
to
prevent
the
re
-
election
of
the
young
Lord
Kilfenora
,
whose
father
,
the
Marquis
of
Bunratty
,
<EOS>
had
scattered
that
six
thousand
pounds
among
the
electors
and
non
-
electors
of
Chelsea
;
but
his
main
object
was
that
money
should
be
spent
.
"
<EOS>
"
Tain't
altogether
for
myself
,
"
he
said
to
a
confidential
friend
in
the
same
way
of
business
;
"
I
do
n't
get
so
much
on
it
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
sometimes
not
none
.
<EOS>
May
be
<EOS>
I
've
a
bill
agin
some
of
those
gents
not
paid
this
werry
moment
.
<EOS>
But
it
's
the
game
<EOS>
I
looks
to
.
<EOS>
If
the
game
dies
away
,
it
'll
never
be
got
up
again
;
 
never
.
<EOS>
Who
'll
care
about
elections
then
?
<EOS>
Anybody'd
go
and

we
was
to
let
the
game
go
by
!
"
<EOS>
And
so
,
that
the
game
might
not
go
by
,
Mr.
Grimes
was
now
present
in
Mr.
George
Vavasor
's
rooms
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
Mr.
Grimes
,
"
said
George
,
"
how
are
you
this
morning
?
<EOS>
Sit
down
,
Mr.
Grimes
.
<EOS>
If
every
man
were
as
punctual
as
you
are
,
the
world
would
go
like
clock
-
work
;
would
n't
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Business
is
business
,
Mr.
Vavasor
,
"
said
the
publican
,
after
having
made
his
salute
,
and
having
taken
his
chair
with
some
little
show
of
mock
modesty
.
<EOS>
"
That
's
my
maxim
.
<EOS>
If
I
did
n't
stick
to
that
,
nothing
would
n't
ever
stick
to
me
;
and
nothing
does
n't
much
as
it
is
.
<EOS>
Times
is
very
bad
,
Mr.
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
they
are
.
<EOS>
They
're
always
bad
.
<EOS>
What
was
the
Devil
made
for
,
except
that
they
should
be
bad
?
<EOS>
But
I
should
have
thought
you
publicans
were
the
last
men
who
ought
to
complain
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Lord
love
you
,
Mr.
Vavasor
;
why
,
I
suppose
of
all
the
men
as
is
put
upon
,
we
're
put
upon
the
worst
.
<EOS>
What
's
the
good
of
drawing
of
beer
,
if
the
more
you
draw
the
more
you
do
n't
make
.
<EOS>
Yesterday
as
ever
was
was
Saturday
,
and
we
drawed
three
pound
ten
and
nine
.
<EOS>
What
'll
that
come
to
,
Mr.
Vavasor
,
when
you
reckons
it
up
with
the
brewer
?
<EOS>
Why
,
it
's
a
next
to
nothing
.
<EOS>
You
knows
that
well
enough
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
word
I
do
n't
.
<EOS>
But
I
know
you
do
n't
sell
a
pint
of
beer
without
getting
a
profit
out
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Lord
love
you
,
Mr.
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
If
I
had
n't
nothink
to
look
to
<EOS>
but
beer
<EOS>
I
could
n't
keep
a
house
over
my
head
;
no
I
could
n't
.
<EOS>
That
house
of
mine
belongs
to
Meux
's
people
;
and
very
good
people
<EOS>
they
are
too
;
 
have
made
a
sight
of
money
;
have
n't
they
,
Mr.
Vavasor
?
<EOS>
I
has
to
get
my
beer
from
them
in
course
.
<EOS>
Why
not
,
when
it
's
their
house
?
<EOS>
But
if
I
sells
their
stuff
as
I
gets
it
,
there
ai
n't
a
halfpenny
coming
to
me
out
of
a
gallon
.
<EOS>
Look
at
that
,
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
then
you
do
n't
sell
it
as
you
get
it
.
<EOS>
You
stretch
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
in
course
.
<EOS>
I
'm
not
going
to
tell
you
a
lie
,
Mr.
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
You
know
what
's
what
as
well
as
I
do
,
and
<EOS>
a
sight
better
,
I
expect
.
<EOS>
There
's
a
dozen
different
ways
of
handling
beer
,
Mr.
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
But
what
's
the
use
of
that
,
when
they
can
take
four
or
five
pounds
a
day
over
the
counter
for
their
rot
-
gut
stuff
at
the
"
Cadogan
Arms
,
"
and
I
ca
n't
do
no
better
nor
yet
perhaps
<EOS>
so
well
,
for
a
real
honest
glass
of
beer
.
<EOS>
Stretch
it
!
<EOS>
It
's
my
belief
the
more
you
poison
their
liquor
,
the
more
the
people
likes
it
!

<EOS>
Mr.
Grimes
was
a
stout
man
,
not
very
tall
,
with
a
mottled
red
face
,
and
large
protruding
eyes
.
<EOS>
As
regards
his
own
person
,
Mr.
Grimes
might
have
been
taken
as
a
fair
sample
of
the
English
innkeeper
,
as
described
for
many
years
past
.
<EOS>
But
in
his
outer
garments
he
was
very
unlike
that
description
.
<EOS>
He
wore
a
black
,
swallow
-
tailed
coat
,
made
,
however
,
to
set
very
loose
upon
his
back
,
a
black
waistcoat
,
and
black
pantaloons
.
<EOS>
He
carried
,
moreover
,
in
his
hands
a
black
chimney
-
pot
hat
.
<EOS>
Not
only
have
the
top
-
boots
and
breeches
vanished
from
the
costume
of
innkeepers
,
but
also
the
long
,
particoloured
waistcoat
,
and
<EOS>
the
birds"-eye
fogle
round
their
necks
.
<EOS>
They
get
themselves
up
to
look
like
Dissenting
ministers
or
undertakers
,
except
that
there
is
still
a
something
about
their
rosy
gills
which
tells
a
tale
of
the
spigot
and
corkscrew
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Grimes
had
only
just
finished
the
tale
of
his
own
hard
ways
as
a
publican
,
when
the
door
-
bell
was
again
rung
.
<EOS>
"
There
's
Scruby
,
"
said
George
Vavasor
,
"
and
now
we
can
go
to
business
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Mr.

His
Odd
Money

<EOS>
The
handmaiden
at
George
Vavasor
's
lodgings
announced
"
another
gent
,
"
and
then
Mr.
Scruby
entered
the
room
in
which
were
seated
George
,
and
Mr.
Grimes
the
publican
from
the
"
Handsome
Man
"
on
the
Brompton
Road
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Scruby
was
an
attorney
from
Great
Marlborough
Street
,
supposed
to
be
very
knowing
in
the
ways
of
metropolitan
elections
;
and
he
had
now
stepped
round
,
as
he
called
it
,
with
the
object
of
saying
a
few
words
to
Mr.
Grimes
,
partly
on
the
subject
of
the
forthcoming
contest
at
Chelsea
,
and
partly
on
that
of
the
contest
last
past
.
<EOS>
These
words
were
to
be
said
in
the
presence
of
Mr.
Vavasor
,
the
person
interested
.
<EOS>
That
some
other
words
had
been
spoken
between
Mr.
Scruby
and
Mr.
Grimes
on
the
same
subjects
behind
Mr.
Vavasor
's
back
<EOS>
I
think
very
probable
.
<EOS>
But
even
though
this
might
have
been
so
I
am
not
prepared
to
say
that
Mr.
Vavasor
had
been
deceived
by
their
combinations
.
  
<EOS>
The
two
men
were
very
civil
to
each
other
in
their
salutations
,
the
attorney
assuming
an
air
of
patronizing
condescension
,
always
calling
the
other
Grimes
;
whereas
Mr.
Scruby
was
treated
with
considerable
deference
by
the
publican
,
and
was
always
called
Mr.
Scruby
.
<EOS>
"
Business
is
business
,
"
said
the
publican
as
soon
as
these
salutations
were
over
;
"
is
n't
it
now
,
Mr.
Scruby
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
I
suppose
Grimes
thinks
Sunday
morning
a
particularly
good
time
for
business
,
"
said
the
attorney
,
laughing
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
quiet
,
you
know
,
"
said
Grimes
.
<EOS>
"
But
it
warn't
me
as
named
Sunday
morning
.
<EOS>
It
was
Mr.
Vavasor
here
.
<EOS>
But
it
is
quiet
;
ai
n't
it
,
Mr.
Scruby
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Scruby
acknowledged
that
it
was
quiet
,
especially
looking
out
over
the
river
,
and
then
they
proceeded
to
business
.
<EOS>
"
We
must
pull
the
governor
through
better
next
time
than
we
did
last
,
"
said
the
attorney
.
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
we
must
,
Mr.
Scruby
;
but
,
Lord
love
you
,
Mr.
Vavasor
,
whose
fault
was
it
?
<EOS>
What
notice
did
I
get
,
 
just
tell
me
that
?
<EOS>
Why
,
Travers
's
name
was
up
on
the
liberal
interest
ever
so
long
before
the
governor
had
ever
thought
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nobody
is
blaming
you
,
Mr.
Grimes
,
"
said
George
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
nobody
ca
n't
,
Mr.
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
I
done
my
work
true
as
steel
,
and
there
ai
n't
another
man
about
the
place
as
could
have
done
half
as
much
.
<EOS>
You
ask
Mr.
Scruby
else
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Scruby
knows
,
if
ere
a
man
in
London
does
.
<EOS>
I
tell
you
what
it
is
,
Mr.
Vavasor
,
them
Chelsea
fellows
,
who
lives
mostly
down
by
the
river
,
ai
n't
like
your
Maryboners
or
Finsburyites
.
<EOS>
It
wants
something
of
a
man
to
manage
them
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
it
<EOS>
Mr.
Scruby
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
wants
something
of
a
man
to
manage
any
of
them
as
far
as
my
experience
goes
,
"
said
Mr.
Scruby
.
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
it
do
;
and
there
ai
n't
one
in
London
knows
so
much
about
it
as
you
do
,
Mr.
Scruby
.
<EOS>
I
will
say
that
for
you
.
<EOS>
But
the
long
and
the
short
of
it
is
this
;
 
business
is
business
,
and
money
is
money
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Money
is
money
,
certainly
,
"
said
Mr.
Scruby
.
<EOS>
"
There
's
no
doubt
in
the
world
about
that
,
Grimes
;
 
and
a
deal
of
it
you
had
out
of
the
last
election
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
had
n't
;
begging
your
pardon
,
Mr.
Scruby
,
for
making
so
free
.
<EOS>
What
I
had
to
my
own
cheek
was
n't
nothing
to
speak
of
.
<EOS>
I
was
n't
paid
for
my
time
;
that
's
what
I
was
n't
.
<EOS>
You
look
how
a
publican
's
business
gets
cut
up
at
them
elections
;
 
and
then
the
state
of
the
house
afterwards
!
<EOS>
What
would
the
governor
say
to
me
if
I
was
to
put
down
painting
inside
and
out
in
my
little
bill
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
does
n't
seem
to
make
much
difference
how
you
put
it
down
,
"
said
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
"
The
total
is
what
I
look
at
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Just
so
,
Mr.
Vavasor
;
just
so
.
<EOS>
The
total
is
what
I
looks
at
too
.
<EOS>
And
I
has
to
look
at
it
a
deuced
long
time
before
I
gets
it
.
<EOS>
I
ai
n't
a
got
it
yet
;
have
I
,
Mr.
Vavasor
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
;
if
you
ask
me
I
should
say
you
had
,
"
said
George
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
I
paid
Mr.
Scruby
three
hundred
pounds
on
your
account
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
got
every
shilling
of
it
,
Mr.
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
I
'm
not
a
going
to
deny
the
money
,
Mr.
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
You
'll
never
find
me
doing
that
.
<EOS>
I
'm
as
round
as
your
hat
,
and
as
square
as
your
elbow
,
 
I
am
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Scruby
knows
me
;
do
n't
you
,
Mr.
Scruby
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
I
know
you
too
well
,
Grimes
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
you
do
n't
,
Mr.
Scruby
;
not
a
bit
too
well
.
<EOS>
Nor
I
do
n't
know
you
too
well
,
either
.
<EOS>
I
respect
you
,
Mr.
Scruby
,
because
you
're
a
man
as
understands
your
business
.
<EOS>
But
as
I
was
saying
,
what
's
three
hundred
pounds
when
a
man
's
bill
is
three
hundred
and
ninety
-
two
thirteen
and
fourpence
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
thought
that
was
all
settled
,
Mr.
Scruby
,
"
said
Vavasor
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
you
see
,
Mr.
Vavasor
,
it
's
very
hard
to
settle
these
things
.
<EOS>
If
you
ask
me
whether
Mr.
Grimes
here
can
sue
you
for
the
balance
,
I
tell
you
very
plainly
that
he
ca
n't
.
<EOS>
We
were
a
little
short
of
money
when
we
came
to
a
settlement
,
as
is
generally
the
case
at
such
times
,
and
so
we
took
Mr.
Grimes
"
receipt
for
three
hundred
pounds
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
you
did
,
Mr.
Scruby
.
"
  
"
Not
on
account
,
but
in
full
of
all
demands
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Now
Mr.
Scruby
!
"
and
the
publican
as
he
made
this
appeal
looked
at
the
attorney
with
an
expression
of
countenance
which
was
absolutely
eloquent
.
<EOS>
"
Are
you
going
to
put
me
off
with
such
an
excuse
as
that
?
"
<EOS>
so
the
look
spoke
plainly
enough
.
"
<EOS>
Are
you
going
to
bring
up
my
own
signature
against
me
,
when
you
know
very
well
that
I
should
n't
have
got
a
shilling
at
all
for
the
next
twelve
months
if
I
had
n't
given
it
?
<EOS>
Oh
Mr.
Scruby
!
<EOS>
"
That
's
what
Mr.
Grimes
"
look
said
,
and
both
Mr.
Scruby
and
Mr.
Vavasor
understood
it
perfectly
.
  
<EOS>
"
In
full
of
all
demands
,
"
said
Mr.
Scruby
,
with
a
slight
tone
of
triumph
in
his
voice
,
as
though
to
show
that
Grimes
"
appeal
had
no
effect
at
all
upon
his
conscience
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
were
to
go
into
a
court
of
law
,
Grimes
,
you
would
n't
have
a
leg
to
stand
upon
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
court
of
law

<EOS>
Who
's
a
going
to
law
with
the
governor
,
I
should
like
to
know
?
<EOS>
not
I
;
not
if
he
did
n't
pay
me
them
<EOS>
ninety
-
two
pounds
thirteen
and
fourpence
for
the
next
five
years
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Five
years
or
fifteen
would
make
no
difference
,
"
said
Scruby
.
<EOS>
"
You
could
n't
do
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
ai
n't
a
going
to
try
.
<EOS>
That
's
not
the
ticket
I
've
come
here
about

Mr.
Vavasor

this
blessed
Sunday
morning

<EOS>
Going
to
law

indeed

<EOS>
But
Mr.

I

got
a
family

<EOS>
"
Not

vale
of
Taunton

I
hope

said
George

<EOS>
"
They
is
at
the

Brompton
Road

<EOS>
I
'm
at
,
<EOS>
Mr.
Scruby
?
<EOS>
As
if
you
did
n't
know
very
well
what
I
'm
at
.
<EOS>
There
's
my
house
;
 
in
all
them
<EOS>
Chelsea
districts
<EOS>
it
's
the
most
convenientest
of
any
public
as
is
open
for
all
manner
of
election
purposes
.
<EOS>
That
's
given
up
to
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
what
next
?
"
said
Scruby
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
next
is
,
I
myself
.
<EOS>
There
is
n't
one
of
the
lot
of
"
em
can
work
them
<EOS>
Chelsea
fellows
down
along
the
river
unless
it
is
me
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Scruby
knows
that
.
<EOS>
Why
I
've
been
a
getting
of
them
up
with
a
view
to
this
very
job
ever
since
;
 
why
ever
since
they
was
a
talking
of
the
Chelsea
districts
.
<EOS>
When
Lord
Robert
was
a
coming
in
for
the
county
on
the
religious
dodge
,
he
could
n't
have
worked
them
fellows
anyhow
,
only
for
me
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Scruby
knows
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Let
's
take
it
all
for
granted
,
Mr.
Grimes
,
"
said
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
"
What
comes
next
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
;
 
them
Bunratty
people
;
it
is
they
as
has
come
next
.
<EOS>
They
know
which
side
their
bread
is
likely
to
be
buttered
;
they
do
.
<EOS>
They
're
a
bidding
for
the
"
Handsome
Man
"
already
;
they
are
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
'd
let
your
house
to
the
Tory
party
,
Grimes
!
"
said
Mr.
Scruby
,
in
a
tone
in
which
disgust
and
anger
were
blended
.
  
<EOS>
"
Who
said
anything
of
my
letting
my
house
to
the
Tory
party
,
Mr.
Scruby
?
<EOS>
I
'm
as
round
as
your
hat
,
Mr.
Scruby
,
and
as
square
as
your
elbow
;
I
am
.
<EOS>
But
suppose
as
all
the
liberal
gents
as
employs
you
,
Mr.
Scruby
,
was
to
turn
again
you
and
not
pay
you
your
little
bills
,
would
n't
you
have
your
eyes
open
for
customers
of
another
kind
?
<EOS>
Come
now
,
Mr.
Scruby
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
wo
n't
make
much
of
that
game
,
Grimes
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
not
;
perhaps
not
.
<EOS>
There
's
a
risk
in
all
these
things
;
is
n't
there
,
Mr.
Vavasor
?
<EOS>
I
should
like
to
see
you
a
Parliament
gent
;
I
should
indeed
.
<EOS>
You
'd
be
a
credit
to
the
districts
;
I
really
think
you
would
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
much
obliged
by
your
good
opinion
,
Mr.
Grimes
,
"
said
George
.
  
<EOS>
"
When
I
sees
a
gent
coming
forward
I
knows
whether
he
's
fit
for
Parliament
,
or
whether
he
ai
n't
.
<EOS>
I
says
you
are
fit
.
<EOS>
But
Lord
love
you
,
Mr.
Vavasor
;
it
's
a
thing
a
gentleman
always
has
to
pay
for
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
true
enough
;
a
deal
more
than
it
's
worth
,
generally
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
A
thing
's
worth
what
it
fetches
.
<EOS>
I
'm
worth
what
I
'll
fetch
;
that
's
the
long
and
the
short
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
want
to
have
my
balance
<EOS>
,
that
's
the
truth
.
<EOS>
It
's
the
odd
money
in
a
man
's
bill
as
always
carries
the
profit
.
<EOS>
You
ask
Mr.
Scruby
else
;
 
only
with
a
lawyer
<EOS>
it
's
all
profit
I
believe
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
what
you
know
about
it
,
"
said
Scruby
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
cut
off
a
man
's
odd
money
,
"
continued
the
publican
,
"
you
break
his
heart
.
<EOS>
He
'd
almost
sooner
have
that
and
leave
the
other
standing
.
<EOS>
He
'd
call
the
hundreds
capital
,
and
if
he
lost
them
at
last
,
why
he
'd
put
it
down
as
being
in
the
way
of
trade
.
<EOS>
But
the
odd
money
;
 
he
looks
at
that
,
Mr.
Vavasor
,
as
in
a
manner
the
very
sweat
of
his
brow
,
the
work
of
his
own
hand
;
that
's
what
goes
to
his
family
,
and
keeps
the
pot
a
boiling
down
-
stairs
.
<EOS>
Never
stop
a
man
's
odd
money
,
Mr.
Vavasor
;
that
is
,
unless
he
comes
it
very
strong
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
is
it
you
want
now
?
"
said
Scruby
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wants
ninety
-
two
pounds
thirteen
and
fourpence
,
Mr.
Scruby
,
and
then
we
'll
go
to
work
for
the
new
fight
with
contented
hearts
.
<EOS>
If
we
're
to
begin
at
all
,
it
's
quite
time
;
it
is
indeed
,
Mr.
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
what
you
mean
us
to
understand
is
,
that
you
wo
n't
begin
at
all
without
your
money
,
"
said
the
lawyer
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
about
it
,
Mr.
Scruby
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Take
a
fifty
-
pound
note
,
Grimes
,
"
said
the
lawyer
.
  
<EOS>
"
Fifty
-
pound
notes
are
not
so
ready
,
"
said
George
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
he
'll
be
only
too
happy
to
have
your
acceptance
;
wo
n't
you
,
Grimes
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
Not
for
fifty
pounds
,
Mr.
Scruby
.
<EOS>
It
's
the
odd
money
that
I
wants
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
mind
the
thirteen
and
four
,
because
that
's
neither
here
nor
there
among
friends
,
but
if
I
did
n't
get
all
them
<EOS>
ninety
-
two
pounds
<EOS>
I
should
be
a
broken
-
hearted
man
;
I
should
indeed
,
Mr.
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
I
could
n't
go
about
your
work
for
next
year
so
as
to
do
you
justice
among
the
electors
.
<EOS>
I
could
n't
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
'd
better
give
him
a
bill
for
ninety
pounds
at
three
months
,
Mr.
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
doubt
he
has
got
a
stamp
in
his
pocket
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
I
have
,
Mr.
Scruby
;
there
ai
n't
no
mistake
about
that
.
<EOS>
A
bill
stamp
is
a
thing
that
often
turns
up
convenient
with
gents
as
mean
business
like
Mr.
Vavasor
and
you
.
<EOS>
But
you
must
make
it
ninety
-
two
;
you
must
indeed
,
Mr.
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
And
do
make
it
two
months
if
you
can
,
Mr.
Vavasor
;
they
do
charge
so
unconscionable
on
ninety
days
at
them
branch
banks
;
they
do
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
George
Vavasor
and
Mr.
Scruby
,
between
them
,
yielded
at
last
,
so
far
as
to
allow
the
bill
to
be
drawn
for
ninety
-
two
pounds
,
but
they
were
stanch
as
to
the
time
.
<EOS>
"
If
it
must
be
,
it
must
,
"
said
the
publican
,
with
a
deep
sigh
,
as
he
folded
up
the
paper
and
put
it
into
the
pocket
of
a
huge
case
which
he
carried
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
now
,
gents
,
I
'll
tell
you
what
it
is
.
<EOS>
We
'll
make
safe
work
of
this
here
next
election
.
<EOS>
We
know
what
's
to
be
our
little
game
in
time
,
and
if
we
do
n't
go
in
and
win
,
my
name
ai
n't
Jacob
Grimes
,
and
I
ai
n't
the
landlord
of
the
"
Handsome
Man
.
<EOS>
"
As
you
gents
has
perhaps
got
something
to
say
among
yourselves
,
I
'll
make
so
bold
as
to
wish
you
good
morning
.
"
<EOS>
So
,
with
that
,
Mr.
Grimes
lifted
his
hat
from
the
floor
,
and
bowed
himself
out
of
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
could
n't
have
done
it
cheaper
;
you
could
n't
,
indeed
,
"
said
the
lawyer
,
as
soon
as
the
sound
of
the
closing
front
door
had
been
heard
.
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
not
;
but
what
a
thief
the
man
is
!
<EOS>
I
remember
your
telling
me
that
the
bill
was
about
the
most
preposterous
you
had
ever
seen
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
So
it
was
,
and
if
we
had
n't
wanted
him
again
of
course
we
should
n't
have
paid
him
.
<EOS>
But
we
'll
have
it
all
off
his
next
account
,
Mr.
Vavasor
,
 
<EOS>
every
shilling
of
it
,
It
's
only
lent
;
that
's
all
;
 
it
's
only
lent
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
one
does
n't
want
to
lend
such
a
man
money
,
if
one
could
help
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
true
.
<EOS>
If
you
look
at
it
in
that
light
,
it
's
quite
true
.
<EOS>
But
you
see
we
can
not
do
without
him
.
<EOS>
If
he
had
n't
got
your
bill
,
he
'd
have
gone
over
to
the
other
fellows
before
the
week
was
over
;
and
the
worst
of
it
would
have
been
that
he
knows
our
hand
.
<EOS>
Looking
at
it
all
round
you
've
got
him
cheap
,
Mr.
Vavasor
;
 
you
have
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Looking
at
it
all
round
is
just
what
I
do
n't
like
,
Mr.
Scruby
,
But
if
a
man
will
have
a
whistle
,
he
must
pay
for
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
ca
n't
do
it
cheap
for
any
of
these
metropolitan
seats
;
you
ca
n't
,
indeed
,
Mr.
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
That
is
,
a
new
man
ca
n't
.
<EOS>
When
you
've
been
in
four
or
five
times
,
like
old
Duncombe
,
why
then
,
of
course
,
you
may
snap
your
fingers
at
such
men
as
Grimes
.
<EOS>
But
the
Chelsea
districts
ai
n't
dear
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
call
them
by
any
means
dear
.
<EOS>
Now
Marylebone
is
dear
,
 
and
so
is
Southwark
.
<EOS>
It
's
dear
,
and
nasty
;
that
's
what
the
borough
is
.
<EOS>
Only
that
I
never
tell
tales
,
I
could
tell
you
a
tale
,
Mr.
Vavasor
,
that
'd
make
your
hair
stand
on
end
;
I
could
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
the
game
is
hardly
worth
the
candle
,
I
believe
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
depends
on
what
way
you
choose
to
look
at
it
.
<EOS>
A
seat
in
Parliament
is
a
great
thing
to
a
man
who
wants
to
make
his
way
;
 
a
very
great
thing
;
 
specially
when
a
man
's
young
,
like
you
,
Mr.
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Young
!
"
said
George
.
<EOS>
"
Sometimes
it
seems
to
me
as
though
I
've
been
living
for
a
hundred
years
.
<EOS>
But
I
wo
n't
trouble
you
with
that
,
Mr.
Scruby
,
and
I
believe
I
need
n't
keep
you
any
longer
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
With
that
,
he
got
up
and
bowed
the
attorney
out
of
the
room
,
with
just
a
little
more
ceremony
than
he
had
shown
to
the
publican
.
  
<EOS>
"
Young
!
"
said
Vavasor
to
himself
,
when
he
was
left
alone
.
<EOS>
"
There
's
my
uncle
,
or
the
old
squire
,
 
they
're
both
younger
men
than
I
am
.
<EOS>
One
cares
for
his
dinner
,
and
the
other
for
his
bullocks
and
his
trees
.
<EOS>
But
what
is
there
that
I
care
for
,
unless
it
is
not
getting
among
the
sheriff
's
officers
for
debt
?
"
<EOS>
Then
he
took
out
a
little
memorandum
-
book
from
his
breast
-
pocket
,
and
having
made
in
it
an
entry
as
to
the
amount
and
date
of
that
bill
which
he
had
just
accepted
on
the
publican
's
behalf
,
he
conned
over
the
particulars
of
its
pages
.
"
<EOS>
Very
blue
<EOS>
;
very
blue
,
indeed
,
"
he
said
to
himself
when
he
had
completed
the
study
.
"
<EOS>
But
nobody
shall
say
I
had
n't
the
courage
to
play
the
game
out
,
and
that
old
fellow
must
die
some
day
,
one
supposes
.
<EOS>
If
I
were
not
a
fool
,
I
should
make
it
up
with
him
before
he
went
;
but
I
am
a
fool
,
and
shall
remain
so
to
the
last
.
<EOS>
"
Soon
after
that
he
dressed
himself
slowly
,
reading
a
little
every
now
<EOS>
and
then
as
he
did
so
.
<EOS>
When
his
toilet
was
completed
,
and
his
Sunday
newspapers
sufficiently
perused
,
he
took
up
his
hat
and
umbrella
and
sauntered
out
.

Alice
Vavasor
Becomes
Troubled
.
 
<EOS>
Kate
Vavasor
had
sent
to
her
brother
only
the
first
half
of
her
cousin
's
letter
,
that
half
in
which
Alice
had
attempted
to
describe
what
had
taken
place
between
her
and
Mr.
Grey
.
<EOS>
In
doing
this
,
Kate
had
been
a
wicked
traitor
,
 
a
traitor
to
that
feminine
faith
against
which
treason
on
the
part
of
one
woman
is
always
unpardonable
in
the
eyes
of
other
women
.
<EOS>
But
her
treason
would
have
been
of
a
deeper
die
<EOS>
had
she
sent
the
latter
portion
,
for
in
that
Alice
had
spoken
of
George
Vavasor
himself
.
<EOS>
But
even
of
this
treason
,
Kate
would
,
I
think
,
have
been
guilty
,
had
the
words
which
Alice
wrote
been
of
a
nature
to
serve
her
own
purpose
if
read
by
her
brother
.
<EOS>
But
they
had
not
been
of
this
nature
.
<EOS>
They
had
spoken
of
George
as
a
man
with
whom
any
closer
connection
than
that
which
existed
at
present
was
impossible
,
and
had
been
written
with
the
view
of
begging
Kate
to
desist
from
making
futile
attempts
in
that
direction
.
<EOS>
"
I
feel
myself
driven
,
"
Alice
had
said
,
"
to
write
all
this
,
as
otherwise
,
 
if
I
were
simply
to
tell
you
that
I
have
resolved
to
part
from
Mr.
Grey
,
 
you
would
think
that
the
other
thing
might
follow
.
<EOS>
The
other
thing
can
not
follow
.
<EOS>
I
should
think
myself
untrue
in
my
friendship
to
you
if
I
did
not
tell
you
about
Mr.
Grey
;
and
you
will
be
untrue
in
your
friendship
to
me
if
you
take
advantage
of
my
confidence
by
saying
more
about
your
brother
.

Alice
's
letter
Kate
had
not
sent
to
George
Vavasor
;
 
"
But
the
other
thing
shall
follow
,
"
Kate
had
said
,
as
she
read
the
words
for
the
second
time
,
and
then
put
the
papers
into
her
desk
.
<EOS>
"
It
shall
follow
.
"
  
<EOS>
To
give
Kate
Vavasor
her
due
,
she
was
,
at
any
rate
,
unselfish
in
her
intrigues
.
<EOS>
She
was
obstinately
persistent
,
and
she
was
moreover
unscrupulous
,
but
she
was
not
selfish
.
<EOS>
Many
years
ago
she
had
made
up
her
mind
that
George
and
Alice
should
be
man
and
wife
,
feeling
that
such
a
marriage
would
be
good
at
any
rate
for
her
brother
.
<EOS>
It
had
been
almost
brought
about
,
and
had
then
been
hindered
altogether
through
a
fault
on
her
brother
's
part
.
<EOS>
But
she
had
forgiven
him
this
sin
as
she
had
forgiven
many
others
,
and
she
was
now
at
work
in
his
behalf
again
,
determined
that
they
two
should
be
married
,
even
though
neither
of
them
might
be
now
anxious
that
it
should
be
so
.
<EOS>
The
intrigue
itself
was
dear
to
her
,
and
success
in
it
was
necessary
to
her
self
-
respect
.
  
<EOS>
She
answered
Alice
's
letter
with
a
pleasant
,
gossiping
epistle
,
which
shall
be
recorded
,
as
it
will
tell
us
something
of
Mrs.
Greenow
's
proceedings
at
Yarmouth
.
<EOS>
Kate
had
promised
to
stay
at
Yarmouth
for
a
month
,
but
she
had
already
been
there
six
weeks
,
and
was
still
under
her
aunt
's
wing
.

<EOS>
DEAREST
ALICE
,
  
<EOS>
Of
course
I
am
delighted
.
<EOS>
It
is
no
good
saying
that
I
am
not
.
<EOS>
I
know
how
difficult
it
is
to
deal
with
you
,
and
therefore
I
sit
down
to
answer
your
letter
with
fear
and
trembling
,
lest
I
should
say
a
word
too
much
,
and
thereby
drive
you
back
,
or
not
say
quite
enough
and
thereby
fail
to
encourage
you
on
.
<EOS>
Of
course
I
am
glad
.
<EOS>
I
have
long
thought
that
Mr.
Grey
could
not
make
you
happy
,
and
as
I
have
thought
so
,
how
can
I
not
be
glad
?
<EOS>
It
is
no
use
saying
that
he
is
good
and
noble
,
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
.
<EOS>
I
have
never
denied
it
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
not
suited
to
you
,
and
his
life
would
have
made
you
wretched
.
<EOS>
Ergo
,
I
rejoice
.
<EOS>
And
as
you
are
the
dearest
friend
I
have
,
of
course
I
rejoice
mightily
.
  
<EOS>
I
can
understand
accurately
the
sort
of
way
in
which
the
interview
went
.
<EOS>
Of
course
he
had
the
best
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
can
see
him
so
plainly
as
he
stood
up
in
unruffled
self
-
possession
,
ignoring
all
that
you
said
,
suggesting
that
you
were
feverish
or
perhaps
bilious
,
waving
his
hand
over
you
a
little
,
as
though
that
might
possibly
do
you
some
small
good
,
and
then
taking
his
leave
with
an
assurance
that
it
would
be
all
right
as
soon
as
the
wind
changed
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
it
's
very
noble
in
him
,
not
taking
you
at
your
word
,
and
giving
you
,
as
it
were
,
another
chance
;
but
there
is
a
kind
of
nobility
which
is
almost
too
great
for
this
world
.
<EOS>
I
think
very
well
of
you
,
<EOS>
my
dear
,
as
women
go
,
but
I
do
not
think
well
enough
of
you
to
believe
that
you
are
fit
to
be
Mr.
John
Grey
's
wife
.
  
<EOS>
Of
course
I
'm
very
glad
.
<EOS>
You
have
known
my
mind
from
the
first
to
the
last
,
and
,
therefore
,
what
would
be
the
good
of
my
mincing
matters
?
<EOS>
No
woman
wishes
her
dearest
friend
to
marry
a
man
to
whom
she
herself
is
antipathetic
.
<EOS>
You
would
have
been
as
much
lost
to
me
,
had
you
become
Mrs.
Grey
of
Nethercoats
,
Cambridgeshire
,
as
though
you
had
gone
to
heaven
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
say
but
what
Nethercoats
may
be
a
kind
of
heaven
,
 
but
then
one
does
n't
wish
one
's
friend
that
distant
sort
of
happiness
.
<EOS>
A
flat
Eden
I
can
fancy
it
,
hemmed
in
by
broad
dykes
,
in
which
cream
and
eggs
are
very
plentiful
,
where
an
Adam
and
an
Eve
might
drink
the
choicest
tea
out
of
the
finest
china
,
with
toast
buttered
to
perfection
,
from
year
's
end
to
year
's
end
;
into
which
no
money
troubles
would
ever
find
their
way
,
nor
yet
any
naughty
novels
.
<EOS>
But
such
an
Eden
is
not
tempting
to
me
,
nor
,
as
I
think
,
to
you
.
<EOS>
I
can
fancy
you
stretching
your
poor
neck
over
the
dyke
,
longing
to
fly
away
that
you
might
cease
to
be
at
rest
,
but
knowing
that
the
matrimonial
dragon
was
too
strong
for
any
such
flight
.
<EOS>
If
ever
bird
banged
his
wings
to
pieces
against
gilded
bars
,
you
would
have
banged
yours
to
pieces
in
that
cage
.
  
<EOS>
You
say
that
you
have
failed
to
make
him
understand
that
the
matter
is
settled
.
<EOS>
I
need
not
say
that
of
course
it
is
settled
,
and
that
he
must
be
made
to
understand
it
.
<EOS>
You
owe
it
to
him
now
to
put
him
out
of
all
doubt
.
<EOS>
He
is
,
I
suppose
,
accessible
to
the
words
of
a
mortal
,
god
though
he
be
.
<EOS>
But
I
do
not
fear
about
this
,
for
,
after
all
,
you
have
as
much
firmness
about
you
as
most
people
;
 
perhaps
as
much
as
he
has
at
bottom
,
though
you
may
not
have
so
many
occasions
to
show
it
.
  
<EOS>
As
to
that
other
matter
I
can
only
say
that
you
shall
be
obliged
,
as
far
as
it
is
in
my
power
to
obey
you
.
<EOS>
For
what
may
come
out
from
me
by
word
of
mouth
when
we
are
together
,
I
will
not
answer
with
certainty
.
<EOS>
But
my
pen
is
under
better
control
,
and
it
shall
not
write
the
offending
name
.
  
<EOS>
And
now
I
must
tell
you
a
little
about
myself
;
 
or
rather
<EOS>
,
I
am
inclined
to
spin
a
yarn
,
and
tell
you
a
great
deal
.
<EOS>
I
have
got
such
a
lover
!
<EOS>
But
I
did
describe
him
before
.
<EOS>
Of
course
it
's
Mr.
Cheesacre
.
<EOS>
If
I
were
to
say
he
has
n't
declared
himself
,
I
should
hardly
give
you
a
fair
idea
of
my
success
.
<EOS>
And
yet
he
has
not
declared
himself
,
 
and
,
which
is
worse
,
is
very
anxious
to
marry
a
rival
.
<EOS>
But
it
's
a
strong
point
in
my
favour
that
my
rival
wants
him
to
take
me
,
and
that
he
will
assuredly
be
driven
to
make
me
an
offer
sooner
or
later
,
in
obedience
to
her
orders
.
<EOS>
My
aunt
is
my
rival
,
and
I
do
not
feel
the
least
doubt
as
to
his
having
offered
to
her
half
a
dozen
times
.
<EOS>
But
then
she
has
another
lover
,
Captain
Bellfield
,
and
I
see
that
she
prefers
him
.
<EOS>
He
is
a
penniless
scamp
and
looks
as
though
he
drank
.
<EOS>
He
paints
his
whiskers
too
,
which
I
do
n't
like
;
and
,
being
forty
,
tries
to
look
like
twenty
-
five
.
<EOS>
Otherwise
he
is
agreeable
enough
,
and
I
rather
approve
of
my
aunt
's
taste
in
preferring
him
.
  
<EOS>
But
my
lover
has
solid
attractions
,
and
allures
me
on
by
a
description
of
the
fat
cattle
which
he
sends
to
market
.
<EOS>
He
is
a
man
of
substance
,
and
should
I
ever
become
Mrs.
Cheesacre
<EOS>
,
I
have
reason
to
think
that
I
shall
not
be
left
in
want
.
<EOS>
We
went
up
to
his
place
on
a
visit
the
other
day
.
<EOS>
Oileymead
is
the
name
of
my
future
home
;
 
not
so
pretty
as
Nethercoats
,
is
it
?
<EOS>
And
we
had
such
a
time
there
!
<EOS>
We
reached
the
place
at
ten
and
left
it
at
four
,
and
he
managed
to
give
us
three
meals
.
<EOS>
I
'm
sure
we
had
before
our
eyes
at
different
times
every
bit
of
china
,
delf
,
glass
,
and
plate
in
the
establishment
.
<EOS>
He
made
us
go
into
the
cellar
,
and
told
us
how
much
wine
he
had
got
there
,
and
how
much
beer
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
all
paid
for
,
Mrs.
Greenow
,
every
bottle
of
it
,
"
he
said
,
turning
round
to
my
aunt
,
with
a
pathetic
earnestness
,
for
which
I
had
hardly
given
him
credit
.
<EOS>
"
Everything
in
this
house
is
my
own
;
it
's
all
paid
for
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
call
anything
a
man
's
own
till
it
's
paid
for
.
<EOS>
Now
that
jacket
that
Bellfield
swells
about
with
on
the
sands
at
Yarmouth
,
 
<EOS>
that
's
not
his
own
,
 
<EOS>
and
it
's
not
like
to
be
either
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
then
he
winked
his
eye
as
though
bidding
my
aunt
to
think
of
that
before
she
encouraged
such
a
lover
as
Bellfield
.
<EOS>
He
took
us
into
every
bedroom
,
and
disclosed
to
us
all
the
glories
of
his
upper
chambers
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
done
you
good
to
see
him
lifting
the
counterpanes
,
and
bidding
my
aunt
feel
the
texture
of
the
blankets
!
<EOS>
And
then
to
see
her
turn
round
to
me
and
say
:
 
"
Kate
,
it
's
simply
the
best
-
furnished
house
I
ever
went
over
in
my
life
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
does
seem
very
comfortable
,
"
said
I.
"
Comfortable
!
"
<EOS>
said
he
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
I
do
n't
think
there
's
<EOS>
anybody
can
say
that
Oileymead
is
n't
comfortable
.
<EOS>
"
I
did
so
think
of
you
and
Nethercoats
.
<EOS>
The
attractions
are
the
same
;
 
only
in
the
one
place
you
would
have
a
god
for
your
keeper
,
and
in
the
other
a
brute
.
<EOS>
For
myself
,
if
ever
I
'm
to
have
a
keeper
at
all
,
I
shall
prefer
a
man
.
<EOS>
But
when
we
got
to
the
farmyard
his
eloquence
reached
the
highest
pitch
.
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Greenow
,
"
said
he
,
"
look
at
that
,
"
and
he
pointed
to
heaps
of
manure
raised
like
the
streets
of
a
little
city
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Look
at
that
!
"
<EOS>
"
There
's
a
great
deal
,
"
said
my
aunt
.
<EOS>
"
I
believe
you
,
"
said
he
.
<EOS>
"
I
've
more
muck
upon
this
place
here
than
any
farmer
in
Norfolk
,
gentle
or
simple
;
I
do
n't
care
who
the
other
is
.
"
<EOS>
Only
fancy
,
Alice
<EOS>
;
it
may
all
be
mine
;
the
blankets
,
the
wine
,
the
muck
,
and
the
rest
of
it
.
<EOS>
So
my
aunt
assured
me
when
we
got
home
that
evening
.
<EOS>
When
I
remarked
that
the
wealth
had
been
exhibited
to
her
and
not
to
me
,
she
did
not
affect
to
deny
it
,
but
treated
that
as
a
matter
of
no
moment
.
"
<EOS>
He
wants
a
wife
,
my
dear
,
"
she
said
,
"
and
you
may
pick
him
up
to
-
morrow
by
putting
out
your
hand
.
<EOS>
"
When
I
remarked
that
his
mind
seemed
to
be
intent
on
low
things
,
and
specially
named
the
muck
,
she
only
laughed
at
me
.
<EOS>
"
Money
's
never
dirty
,
"
she
said
,
"
nor
yet
what
makes
money
.
"
<EOS>
She
talks
of
taking
lodgings
in
Norwich
for
the
winter
,
saying
that
in
her
widowed
state
she
will
be
as
well
there
as
anywhere
else
,
and
she
wants
me
to
stay
with
her
up
to
Christmas
.
<EOS>
Indeed
she
first
proposed
the
Norwich
plan
on
the
ground
that
it
might
be
useful
to
me
,
 
with
a
view
to
Mr.
Cheesacre
,
of
course
;
but
I
fancy
that
she
is
unwilling
to
tear
herself
away
from
Captain
Bellfield
.
<EOS>
At
any
rate
to
Norwich
she
will
go
,
and
I
have
promised
not
to
leave
her
before
the
second
week
in
November
.
<EOS>
With
all
her
absurdities
I
like
her
.
<EOS>
Her
faults
are
terrible
faults
,
but
she
has
not
the
fault
of
hiding
them
by
falsehood
.
<EOS>
She
is
never
stupid
,
and
she
is
very
good
-
natured
.
<EOS>
She
would
have
allowed
me
to
equip
myself
from
head
to
foot
at
her
expense
,
if
I
would
have
accepted
her
liberality
,
and
absolutely
offered
to
give
me
my
trousseau
if
I
would
marry
Mr.
Cheesacre
.
  
<EOS>
I
live
in
the
hope
that
you
will
come
down
to
the
old
place
at
Christmas
.
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
offend
you
more
than
I
can
help
.
<EOS>
At
any
rate
he
wo
n't
be
there
.
<EOS>
And
if
I
do
n't
see
you
there
,
where
am
I
to
see
you
?
<EOS>
If
I
were
you
I
would
certainly
not
go
to
Cheltenham
.
<EOS>
You
are
never
happy
there
.
  
<EOS>
Do
you
ever
dream
of
the
river
at
Basle
?
<EOS>
I
do
;
 
so
often
.
  
<EOS>
Most
affectionately
yours
,
  
KATE
VAVASOR
.
  
<EOS>
Alice
had
almost
lost
the
sensation
created
by
the
former
portion
of
Kate
's
letter
by
the
fun
of
the
latter
,
before
she
had
quite
made
that
sensation
her
own
.
<EOS>
The
picture
of
the
Cambridgeshire
Eden
would
have
displeased
her
had
she
dwelt
upon
it
,
and
the
allusion
to
the
cream
and
toast
would
have
had
the
very
opposite
effect
to
that
which
Kate
had
intended
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
Kate
had
felt
this
,
and
had
therefore
merged
it
all
in
her
stories
about
Mr.
Cheesacre
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
go
to
Cheltenham
,
"
she
said
to
herself
.
"
<EOS>
He
has
recommended
it
.
<EOS>
I
shall
never
be
his
wife
;
 
but
,
till
we
have
parted
altogether
,
I
will
show
him
that
I
think
well
of
his
advice
.
<EOS>
"
That
same
afternoon
she
told
her
father
that
she
would
go
to
Lady
Macleod
's
at
Cheltenham
before
the
end
of
the
month
.
<EOS>
She
was
,
in
truth
,
prompted
to
this
by
a
resolution
,
of
which
she
was
herself
hardly
conscious
,
that
she
would
not
at
this
period
of
her
life
be
in
any
way
guided
by
her
cousin
.
<EOS>
Having
made
up
her
mind
about
Mr.
Grey
,
it
was
right
that
she
should
let
her
cousin
know
her
purpose
;
but
she
would
never
be
driven
to
confess
to
herself
that
Kate
had
influenced
her
in
the
matter
.
<EOS>
She
would
go
to
Cheltenham
.
<EOS>
Lady
Macleod
would
no
doubt
vex
her
by
hourly
solicitations
that
the
match
might
be
renewed
;
but
,
if
she
knew
herself
,
she
had
strength
to
withstand
Lady
Macleod
.
  
<EOS>
She
received
one
letter
from
Mr.
Grey
before
the
time
came
for
her
departure
,
and
she
answered
it
,
telling
him
of
her
intention
;
 
telling
him
also
that
she
now
felt
herself
bound
to
explain
to
her
father
her
present
position
.
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
this
,
"
she
said
,
"
in
consequence
of
what
you
said
to
me
on
the
matter
.
<EOS>
My
father
will
know
it
to
-
morrow
,
and
on
the
following
morning
I
shall
start
for
Cheltenham
.
<EOS>
I
have
heard
from
Lady
Macleod
and
she
expects
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
On
the
following
morning
she
did
tell
her
father
,
standing
by
him
as
he
sat
at
his
breakfast
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
!
<EOS>
"
said
he
,
putting
down
his
tea
-
cup
and
looking
up
into
her
face
;
"
What
!
<EOS>
not
marry
John
Grey
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
papa
;
I
know
how
strange
you
must
think
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
say
that
there
has
been
no
quarrel
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
 
there
has
been
no
quarrel
.
<EOS>
By
degrees
I
have
learned
to
feel
that
I
should
not
make
him
happy
as
his
wife
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
d
 
<EOS>
---
d
nonsense
,
"
said
Mr.
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
Now
such
an
expression
as
this
from
him
,
addressed
to
his
daughter
,
showed
that
he
was
very
deeply
moved
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
papa
!
<EOS>
do
n't
talk
to
me
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
it
is
.
<EOS>
I
never
heard
such
trash
in
my
life
.
<EOS>
If
he
comes
to
me
I
shall
tell
him
so
.
<EOS>
Not
make
him
happy
!
<EOS>
Why
ca
n't
you
make
him
happy
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
are
not
suited
to
each
other
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
what
's
the
matter
with
him
?
<EOS>
He
's
a
gentleman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
he
's
a
gentleman
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
a
man
of
honour
,
and
with
good
means
,
and
with
all
that
knowledge
and
reading
which
you
profess
to
like
.
<EOS>
Look
here
,
Alice
;
I
am
not
going
to
interfere
,
nor
shall
I
attempt
to
make
you
marry
anyone
.
<EOS>
You
are
your
own
mistress
as
far
as
that
is
concerned
.
<EOS>
But
I
do
hope
,
for
your
sake
and
for
mine
,
 
I
do
hope
that
there
is
nothing
again
between
you
and
your
cousin
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
nothing
,
papa
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
not
like
your
going
abroad
with
him
,
though
I
did
n't
choose
to
interrupt
your
plan
by
saying
so
.
<EOS>
But
if
there
were
anything
of
that
kind
going
on
,
I
should
be
bound
to
tell
you
that
your
cousin
's
position
at
present
is
not
a
good
one
.
<EOS>
Men
do
not
speak
well
of
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
nothing
between
us
,
papa
;
but
if
there
were
,
men
speaking
ill
of
him
would
not
deter
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
men
speaking
well
of
Mr.
Grey
will
not
do
the
other
thing
.
<EOS>
I
know
very
well
that
women
can
be
obstinate
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
n't
come
to
this
resolution
without
thinking
much
about
it
,
papa
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
not
.
<EOS>
Well
;
 
I
ca
n't
say
anything
more
.
<EOS>
You
are
your
own
mistress
,
and
your
fortune
is
in
your
own
keeping
.
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
make
you
marry
John
Grey
.
<EOS>
I
think
you
very
foolish
,
and
if
he
comes
to
me
I
shall
tell
him
so
.
<EOS>
You
are
going
down
to
Cheltenham
,
are
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
papa
;
I
have
promised
Lady
Macleod
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
well
.
<EOS>
I
'd
sooner
it
should
be
you
than
me
;
that
's
all
I
can
say
.
<EOS>
"
Then
he
took
up
his
newspaper
,
thereby
showing
that
he
had
nothing
further
to
say
on
the
matter
,
and
Alice
left
him
alone
.
  
<EOS>
The
whole
thing
was
so
vexatious
that
even
Mr.
Vavasor
was
disturbed
by
it
.
<EOS>
As
it
was
not
term
time
he
had
no
signing
to
do
in
Chancery
Lane
,
and
could
not
,
therefore
,
bury
his
unhappiness
in
his
daily
labour
,
 
or
rather
in
his
labour
that
was
by
no
means
daily
.
<EOS>
So
he
sat
at
home
till
four
o'clock
,
expressing
to
himself
in
various
phrases
his
wonder
that
"
any
man
alive
should
ever
rear
a
daughter
.
"
<EOS>
And
when
he
got
to
his
club
the
waiters
found
him
quite
unmanageable
about
his
dinner
,
which
he
ate
alone
,
rejecting
all
proposition
of
companionship
.
<EOS>
But
later
in
the
evening
he
regained
his
composure
over
a
glass
of
whiskey
-
toddy
and
a
cigar
.
<EOS>
"
She
's
got
her
own
money
,
"
he
said
to
himself
,
"
and
what
does
it
matter
?
<EOS>
I
do
n't
suppose
she
'll
marry
her
cousin
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
think
she
's
fool
enough
for
that
.
<EOS>
And
after
all
she
'll
probably
make
it
up
again
with
John
Grey
.
"
<EOS>
And
in
this
way
he
determined
that
he
might
let
this
annoyance
run
off
him
,
and
that
he
need
not
as
a
father
take
the
trouble
of
any
interference
.
  
<EOS>
But
while
he
was
at
his
club
there
came
a
visitor
to
Queen
Anne
Street
,
and
that
visitor
was
the
dangerous
cousin
of
whom
,
according
to
his
uncle
's
testimony
,
men
at
present
did
not
speak
well
.
<EOS>
Alice
had
not
seen
him
since
they
had
parted
on
the
day
of
their
arrival
in
London
,
 
nor
,
indeed
,
had
heard
of
his
whereabouts
.
<EOS>
In
the
consternation
of
her
mind
at
this
step
which
she
was
taking
,
 
a
step
which
she
had
taught
herself
to
regard
as
essentially
her
duty
before
it
was
taken
,
but
which
seemed
to
herself
to
be
false
and
treacherous
<EOS>
the
moment
she
had
taken
it
<EOS>
,
 
she
had
become
aware
that
she
had
been
wrong
to
travel
with
her
cousin
.
<EOS>
She
felt
sure
,
 
she
thought
that
she
was
sure
,
 
that
her
doing
so
<EOS>
had
in
nowise
affected
her
dealings
with
Mr.
Grey
.
<EOS>
She
was
very
certain
,
 
<EOS>
she
thought
that
she
was
certain
,
 
that
she
would
have
rejected
him
just
the
same
<EOS>
had
she
never
gone
to
Switzerland
.
<EOS>
But
every
one
would
say
of
her
that
her
journey
to
Switzerland
with
such
companions
had
produced
that
result
.
<EOS>
It
had
been
unlucky
and
she
was
sorry
for
it
,
and
she
now
wished
to
avoid
all
communication
with
her
cousin
till
this
affair
should
be
altogether
over
.
<EOS>
She
was
especially
unwilling
to
see
him
;
but
she
had
not
felt
it
necessary
to
give
any
special
injunctions
as
to
his
admittance
;
and
now
,
before
she
had
time
to
think
of
it
,
 
on
the
eve
of
her
departure
for
Cheltenham
,
 
<EOS>
he
was
in
the
room
with
her
,
just
as
the
dusk
of
the
October
evening
was
coming
on
.
<EOS>
She
was
sitting
away
from
the
fire
,
almost
behind
the
window
-
curtains
,
thinking
of
John
Grey
and
very
unhappy
in
her
thoughts
,
when
George
Vavasor
was
announced
.
<EOS>
It
will
of
course
be
understood
that
Vavasor
had
at
this
time
received
his
sister
's
letter
.
<EOS>
He
had
received
it
,
and
had
had
time
to
consider
the
matter
since
the
Sunday
morning
on
which
we
saw
him
in
his
own
rooms
in
Cecil
Street
.
<EOS>
"
She
can
turn
it
all
into
capital
to
-
morrow
,
if
she
pleases
,
"
he
had
said
to
himself
when
thinking
of
her
income
.
<EOS>
But
he
had
also
reminded
himself
that
her
grandfather
would
probably
enable
him
to
settle
an
income
out
of
the
property
upon
Alice
,
in
the
event
of
their
being
married
.
<EOS>
And
then
he
had
also
felt
that
he
could
have
no
greater
triumph
than
"
walking
atop
of
John
Grey
,
"
as
he
called
it
.
<EOS>
His
return
for
the
Chelsea
Districts
would
hardly
be
sweeter
to
him
than
that
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
have
thought
I
had
vanished
out
of
the
world
,
"
said
George
,
coming
up
to
her
with
his
extended
hand
.
  
<EOS>
Alice
was
confused
,
and
hardly
knew
how
to
address
him
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Somebody
told
me
that
you
were
shooting
,
"
she
said
after
a
pause
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
I
was
,
but
my
shooting
is
not
like
the
shooting
of
your
great
Nimrods
,
 
men
who
are
hunters
upon
the
earth
.
<EOS>
Two
days
among
the
grouse
and
two
more
among
the
partridges
are
about
the
extent
of
it
.
<EOS>
Capel
Court
is
the
preserve
in
which
I
am
usually
to
be
found
.
"
  
<EOS>
Alice
knew
nothing
of
Capel
Court
,
and
said
,
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Have
you
heard
from
Kate
?
"
George
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
once
or
twice
;
she
is
still
at
Yarmouth
with
Aunt
Greenow
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
is
going
to
Norwich
,
as
she
says
.
<EOS>
Kate
seems
to
have
made
a
league
with
Aunt
Greenow
.
<EOS>
I
,
who
do
n't
pretend
to
be
very
disinterested
in
money
matters
,
think
that
she
is
quite
right
.
<EOS>
No
doubt
Aunt
Greenow
may
marry
again
,
but
friends
with
forty
thousand
pounds
are
always
agreeable
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
believe
that
Kate
thinks
much
of
that
,
"
said
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
so
much
as
she
ought
,
I
dare
say
.
<EOS>
Poor
Kate
is
not
a
rich
woman
,
or
,
I
fear
,
likely
to
become
one
.
<EOS>
She
does
n't
seem
to
dream
of
getting
married
,
and
her
own
fortune
is
less
than
a
hundred
a
year
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Girls
who
never
dream
of
getting
married
are
just
those
who
make
the
best
marriages
at
last
,
"
said
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Perhaps
so
,
<EOS>
but
I
wish
I
was
easier
about
Kate
.
<EOS>
She
is
the
best
sister
a
man
ever
had
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
she
is
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
have
done
nothing
for
her
as
yet
.
<EOS>
I
did
think
,
while
I
was
in
that
wine
business
,
that
I
could
have
done
anything
I
pleased
for
her
.
<EOS>
But
my
grandfather
's
obstinacy
put
me
out
of
that
;
and
now
I
'm
beginning
the
world
again
,
 
that
is
,
comparatively
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
whether
you
think
I
'm
wrong
in
trying
to
get
into
Parliament
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
quite
right
.
<EOS>
I
admire
you
for
it
.
<EOS>
It
is
just
what
I
would
do
in
your
place
.
<EOS>
You
are
unmarried
,
and
have
a
right
to
run
the
risk
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
so
glad
to
hear
you
speak
like
that
,
"
said
he
.
<EOS>
He
had
now
managed
to
take
up
that
friendly
,
confidential
,
almost
affectionate
tone
of
talking
which
he
had
so
often
used
when
abroad
with
her
,
and
which
he
had
failed
to
assume
when
first
entering
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
always
thought
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
have
never
said
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Have
n't
I
?
<EOS>
I
thought
I
had
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Not
heartily
like
that
.
<EOS>
I
know
that
people
abuse
me
;
 
<EOS>
my
own
people
,
my
grandfather
,
and
probably
your
father
,
 
saying
that
I
am
reckless
and
the
rest
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
do
risk
everything
for
my
object
;
but
I
do
not
know
that
any
one
can
blame
me
,
 
unless
it
be
Kate
.
<EOS>
To
whom
else
do
I
owe
anything
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Kate
does
not
blame
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
she
sympathizes
with
me
;
<EOS>
she
,
and
she
only
,
unless
it
be
you
.
"
<EOS>
Then
he
paused
for
an
answer
,
but
she
made
him
none
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
is
brave
enough
to
give
me
her
hearty
sympathy
.
<EOS>
But
perhaps
for
that
very
reason
I
ought
to
be
the
more
chary
in
endangering
the
only
support
that
she
is
like
to
have
.
<EOS>
What
is
ninety
pounds
a
year
for
the
maintenance
of
a
single
lady
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
that
Kate
will
always
live
with
me
,
"
said
Alice
;
"
that
is
,
as
soon
as
she
has
lost
her
home
at
Vavasor
Hall
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
had
been
very
crafty
and
had
laid
a
trap
for
her
.
<EOS>
He
had
laid
a
trap
for
her
,
and
she
had
fallen
into
it
.
<EOS>
She
had
determined
not
to
be
induced
to
talk
of
herself
;
but
he
had
brought
the
thing
round
so
cunningly
that
the
words
were
out
of
her
mouth
before
she
remembered
whither
they
would
lead
her
.
<EOS>
She
did
remember
this
as
she
was
speaking
them
,
but
then
it
was
too
late
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
;
 
at
Nethercoats
?
"
said
he
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Neither
she
nor
I
doubt
your
love
,
but
few
men
would
like
such
an
intruder
as
that
into
their
household
,
and
of
all
men
Mr.
Grey
,
whose
nature
is
retiring
,
would
like
it
the
least
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
not
thinking
of
Nethercoats
,
"
said
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
no
;
that
is
it
,
you
see
.
<EOS>
Kate
says
so
often
to
me
that
when
you
are
married
she
will
be
alone
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
she
will
ever
find
that
I
shall
separate
myself
from
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
not
by
any
will
of
your
own
.
<EOS>
Poor
Kate
!
<EOS>
You
can
not
be
surprised
that
she
should
think
of
your
marriage
with
dread
.
<EOS>
How
much
of
her
life
has
been
made
up
of
her
companionship
with
you
;
 
and
all
the
best
of
it
too
!
<EOS>
You
ought
not
to
be
angry
with
her
for
regarding
your
withdrawal
into
Cambridgeshire
with
dismay
.
"
  
<EOS>
Alice
could
not
act
the
lie
which
now
seemed
to
be
incumbent
on
her
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
let
him
talk
of
Nethercoats
as
though
it
were
to
be
her
future
home
.
<EOS>
She
made
the
struggle
,
and
she
found
that
she
could
not
do
it
.
<EOS>
She
was
unable
to
find
the
words
which
should
tell
no
lie
to
the
ear
,
and
which
should
yet
deceive
him
.
"
<EOS>
Kate
may
still
live
with
me
,
"
she
said
slowly
.
<EOS>
"
Everything
is
over
between
me
and
Mr.
Grey
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Alice
!
 
is
that
true
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
George
;
it
is
true
.
<EOS>
If
you
will
allow
me
to
say
so
<EOS>
,
I
would
rather
not
talk
about
it
;
 
not
just
at
present
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
does
Kate
know
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Kate
knows
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
my
uncle
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
papa
knows
it
also
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Alice
,
how
can
I
help
speaking
of
it
?
<EOS>
How
can
I
not
tell
you
that
I
am
rejoiced
that
you
are
saved
from
a
thraldom
which
I
have
long
felt
sure
would
break
your
heart
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Pray
do
not
talk
of
it
further
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
;
if
I
am
forbidden
I
shall
of
course
obey
.
<EOS>
But
I
own
it
is
hard
to
me
.
<EOS>
How
can
I
not
congratulate
you
?
"
<EOS>
To
this
she
answered
nothing
,
but
beat
with
her
foot
upon
the
floor
as
though
she
were
impatient
of
his
words
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
Alice
,
I
understand
.
<EOS>
You
are
angry
with
me
,
"
he
continued
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
yet
you
have
no
right
to
be
surprised
that
when
you
tell
me
this
I
should
think
of
all
that
passed
between
us
in
Switzerland
.
<EOS>
Surely
the
cousin
who
was
with
you
then
has
a
right
to
say
what
he
thinks
of
this
change
in
your
life
;
at
any
rate
he
may
do
so
,
if
as
in
this
case
he
approves
altogether
of
what
you
are
doing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
of
your
approval
,
George
;
but
pray
let
that
be
an
end
to
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
After
that
the
two
sat
silent
for
a
minute
or
two
.
<EOS>
She
was
waiting
for
him
to
go
,
but
she
could
not
bid
him
leave
the
house
.
<EOS>
She
was
angry
with
herself
,
in
that
she
had
allowed
herself
to
tell
him
of
her
altered
plans
,
and
she
was
angry
with
him
because
he
would
not
understand
that
she
ought
to
be
spared
all
conversation
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
So
she
sat
looking
through
the
window
at
the
row
of
gaslights
as
they
were
being
lit
,
and
he
remained
in
his
chair
with
his
elbow
on
the
table
and
his
head
resting
on
his
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
remember
asking
me
whether
I
ever
shivered
,
"
he
said
at
last
;
"
 
whether
I
ever
thought
of
things
that
made
me
shiver
?
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
remember
;
on
the
bridge
at
Basle
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
I
remember
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Alice
;
 
one
cause
for
my
shivering
is
over
.
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
say
more
than
that
now
.
<EOS>
Shall
you
remain
long
at
Cheltenham
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Just
a
month
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
then
you
come
back
here
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
so
.
<EOS>
Papa
and
I
will
probably
go
down
to
Vavasor
Hall
before
Christmas
.
<EOS>
How
much
before
I
can
not
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
shall
see
you
at
any
rate
after
your
return
from
Cheltenham
?
<EOS>
Of
course
Kate
will
know
,
and
she
will
tell
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
Kate
will
know
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
she
will
stay
here
when
she
comes
up
from
Norfolk
.
<EOS>
Good
-
bye
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Good
-
bye
,
Alice
.
<EOS>
I
shall
have
fewer
fits
of
that
inward
shivering
that
you
spoke
of
,
 
many
less
,
on
account
of
what
I
have
now
heard
.
<EOS>
God
bless
you
,
Alice
;
good
-
bye
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Good
-
bye
,
George
.
"
  
<EOS>
As
he
went
he
took
her
hand
and
pressed
it
closely
between
his
own
.
<EOS>
In
those
days
when
they
were
lovers
,
 
engaged
lovers
,
a
close
,
long
-
continued
pressure
of
her
hand
had
been
his
most
eloquent
speech
of
love
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
been
given
to
many
kisses
,
 
not
even
to
many
words
of
love
.
<EOS>
But
he
would
take
her
hand
and
hold
it
,
even
as
he
looked
away
from
her
,
and
she
remembered
well
the
touch
of
his
palm
.
<EOS>
It
was
ever
cool
,
 
cool
,
and
with
a
surface
smooth
as
a
woman
's
,
 
a
small
hand
that
had
a
firm
grip
.
<EOS>
There
had
been
days
when
she
had
loved
to
feel
that
her
own
was
within
it
,
when
she
trusted
in
it
,
and
intended
that
it
should
be
her
staff
through
life
.
<EOS>
Now
she
distrusted
it
;
and
as
the
thoughts
of
the
old
days
came
upon
her
,
and
the
remembrance
of
that
touch
was
recalled
,
she
drew
her
hand
away
rapidly
.
<EOS>
Not
for
that
had
she
driven
from
her
as
honest
a
man
as
had
ever
wished
to
mate
with
a
woman
.
<EOS>
He
,
George
Vavasor
,
had
never
so
held
her
hand
since
the
day
when
they
had
parted
,
and
now
on
this
first
occasion
of
her
freedom
she
felt
it
again
.
<EOS>
What
did
he
think
of
her
?
<EOS>
Did
he
suppose
that
she
could
transfer
her
love
in
that
way
,
as
a
flower
may
be
taken
from
one
buttonhole
and
placed
in
another
?
<EOS>
He
read
it
all
,
and
knew
that
he
was
hurrying
on
too
quickly
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
understand
well
,
"
he
said
in
a
whisper
,
"
what
your
present
feelings
are
;
but
I
do
not
think
you
will
be
really
angry
with
me
because
I
have
been
unable
to
repress
my
joy
at
what
I
can
not
but
regard
as
your
release
from
a
great
misfortune
.
"
<EOS>
Then
he
went
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
release
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
seating
herself
on
the
chair
from
which
he
had
risen
.
<EOS>
"
My
release
from
a
misfortune
!
<EOS>
No
;
 
but
my
fall
from
heaven
!
<EOS>
Oh
,
what
a
man
he
is
!
<EOS>
That
he
should
have
loved
me
,
and
that
I
should
have
driven
him
away
from
me
!
"
<EOS>
Her
thoughts
travelled
off
to
the
sweetness
of
that
home
at
Nethercoats
,
to
the
excellence
of
that
master
who
might
have
been
hers
;
and
then
in
an
agony
of
despair
she
told
herself
that
she
had
been
an
idiot
and
a
fool
,
as
well
as
a
traitor
.
<EOS>
What
had
she
wanted
in
life
that
she
should
have
thus
quarrelled
with
as
happy
a
lot
as
ever
had
been
offered
to
a
woman
?
<EOS>
Had
she
not
been
mad
,
when
she
sent
from
her
side
the
only
man
that
she
loved
,
 
the
only
man
that
she
had
ever
truly
respected
?
<EOS>
For
hours
she
sat
there
,
all
alone
,
putting
out
the
candles
which
the
servant
had
lighted
for
her
,
and
leaving
untasted
the
tea
that
was
brought
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
Poor
Alice
!
<EOS>
I
hope
that
she
may
be
forgiven
.
<EOS>
It
was
her
special
fault
,
that
when
at
Rome
she
longed
for
Tibur
,
and
when
at
Tibur
she
regretted
Rome
.
<EOS>
Not
that
her
cousin
George
is
to
be
taken
as
representing
the
joys
of
the
great
capital
,
though
Mr.
Grey
may
be
presumed
to
form
no
inconsiderable
part
of
the
promised
delights
of
the
country
.
<EOS>
Now
that
she
had
sacrificed
her
Tibur
,
because
it
had
seemed
to
her
that
the
sunny
quiet
of
its
pastures
lacked
the
excitement
necessary
for
the
happiness
of
life
,
she
was
again
prepared
to
quarrel
with
the
heartlessness
of
Rome
,
and
already
was
again
sighing
for
the
tranquillity
of
the
country
.
  
<EOS>
Sitting
there
,
full
of
these
regrets
,
she
declared
to
herself
that
she
would
wait
for
her
father
's
return
,
and
then
,
throwing
herself
upon
his
love
and
upon
his
mercy
,
would
beg
him
to
go
to
Mr.
Grey
and
ask
for
pardon
for
her
.
<EOS>
"
I
should
be
very
humble
to
him
,
"
she
said
;
"
but
he
is
so
good
,
that
I
may
dare
to
be
humble
before
him
.
"
<EOS>
So
she
waited
for
her
father
.
<EOS>
She
waited
till
twelve
,
till
one
,
till
two
;
 
but
still
he
did
not
come
.
<EOS>
Later
than
that
she
did
not
dare
to
wait
for
him
.
<EOS>
She
feared
to
trust
him
on
such
business
returning
so
late
as
that
,
 
after
so
many
cigars
;
after
,
perhaps
,
some
superfluous
beakers
of
club
nectar
.
<EOS>
His
temper
at
such
a
moment
would
not
be
fit
for
such
work
as
hers
.
<EOS>
But
if
he
was
late
in
coming
home
,
who
had
sent
him
away
from
his
home
in
unhappiness
?
<EOS>
Between
two
and
three
<EOS>
she
went
to
bed
,
and
on
the
following
morning
she
left
Queen
Anne
Street
for
the
Great
Western
Station
before
her
father
was
up
.
   
<EOS>
Paramount
Crescent
.
 
<EOS>
Lady
Macleod
lived
at
No
.
3
,
Paramount
Crescent
,
in
Cheltenham
,
where
she
occupied
a
very
handsome
first
-
floor
drawing
-
room
,
with
a
bedroom
behind
it
,
looking
over
a
stable
-
yard
,
and
a
small
room
which
would
have
been
the
dressing
-
room
had
the
late
Sir
Archibald
been
alive
,
but
which
was
at
present
called
the
dining
-
room
:
and
in
it
Lady
Macleod
did
dine
whenever
her
larger
room
was
to
be
used
for
any
purposes
of
evening
company
.
<EOS>
The
vicinity
of
the
stable
-
yard
was
not
regarded
by
the
tenant
as
among
the
attractions
of
the
house
;
but
it
had
the
effect
of
lowering
the
rent
,
and
Lady
Macleod
was
a
woman
who
regarded
such
matters
.
<EOS>
Her
income
,
though
small
,
would
have
sufficed
to
enable
her
to
live
removed
from
such
discomforts
;
but
she
was
one
of
those
women
who
regard
it
as
a
duty
to
leave
something
behind
them
,
 
even
though
it
be
left
to
those
who
do
not
at
all
want
it
;
and
Lady
Macleod
was
a
woman
who
wilfully
neglected
no
duty
.
<EOS>
So
she
pinched
herself
,
and
inhaled
the
effluvia
of
the
stables
,
and
squabbled
with
the
cabmen
,
in
order
that
she
might
bequeath
a
thousand
pounds
or
two
to
some
Lady
Midlothian
,
who
cared
,
perhaps
,
little
for
her
,
and
would
hardly
thank
her
memory
for
the
money
.
  
<EOS>
Had
Alice
consented
to
live
with
her
,
she
would
have
merged
that
duty
of
leaving
money
behind
her
in
that
other
duty
of
finding
a
home
for
her
adopted
niece
.
<EOS>
But
Alice
had
gone
away
,
and
therefore
the
money
was
due
to
Lady
Midlothian
rather
than
to
her
.
<EOS>
The
saving
,
however
,
was
postponed
whenever
Alice
would
consent
to
visit
Cheltenham
;
and
a
bedroom
was
secured
for
her
which
did
not
look
out
over
the
stables
.
<EOS>
Accommodation
was
also
found
for
her
maid
much
better
than
that
provided
for
Lady
Macleod
's
own
maid
.
<EOS>
She
was
a
hospitable
,
good
old
woman
,
painfully
struggling
to
do
the
best
she
could
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
pity
that
she
was
such
a
bore
,
a
pity
that
she
was
so
hard
to
cabmen
and
others
,
a
pity
that
she
suspected
all
tradesmen
,
servants
,
and
people
generally
of
a
rank
of
life
inferior
to
her
own
,
a
pity
that
she
was
disposed
to
condemn
for
ever
and
ever
so
many
of
her
own
rank
because
they
played
cards
on
week
days
,
and
did
not
go
to
church
on
Sundays
,
 
and
a
pity
,
as
I
think
above
all
,
that
while
she
was
so
suspicious
of
the
poor
she
was
so
lenient
to
the
vices
of
earls
,
earl
's
sons
,
and
such
like
.
  
<EOS>
Alice
,
having
fully
considered
the
matter
,
had
thought
it
most
prudent
to
tell
Lady
Macleod
by
letter
what
she
had
done
in
regard
to
Mr.
Grey
.
<EOS>
There
had
been
many
objections
to
the
writing
of
such
a
letter
,
but
there
appeared
to
be
stronger
objection
to
that
telling
it
face
to
face
which
would
have
been
forced
upon
her
<EOS>
had
she
not
written
.
<EOS>
There
would
in
such
case
have
arisen
on
Lady
Macleod
's
countenance
a
sternness
of
rebuke
which
Alice
did
not
choose
to
encounter
.
<EOS>
The
same
sternness
of
rebuke
would
come
upon
the
countenance
on
receipt
of
the
written
information
;
but
it
would
come
in
its
most
aggravated
form
on
the
immediate
receipt
of
the
letter
,
and
some
of
its
bitterness
would
have
passed
away
before
Alice
's
arrival
.
<EOS>
I
think
that
Alice
was
right
.
<EOS>
It
is
better
for
both
parties
that
any
great
offence
should
be
confessed
by
letter
.
  
<EOS>
But
Alice
trembled
as
the
cab
drew
up
at
No
.
3
,
Paramount
Crescent
.
<EOS>
She
met
her
aunt
,
as
was
usual
,
just
inside
the
drawing
-
room
door
,
and
she
saw
at
once
that
if
any
bitterness
had
passed
away
from
that
face
,
the
original
bitterness
must
indeed
have
been
bitter
.
<EOS>
She
had
so
timed
her
letter
that
Lady
Macleod
should
have
no
opportunity
of
answering
it
.
<EOS>
The
answer
was
written
there
in
the
mingled
anger
and
sorrow
of
those
austere
features
.
  
<EOS>
"
Alice
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
as
she
took
her
niece
in
her
arms
and
kissed
her
;
"
oh
,
Alice
,
what
is
this
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
aunt
;
it
is
very
bad
,
I
know
,
"
and
poor
Alice
tried
to
make
a
jest
of
it
.
"
<EOS>
Young
ladies
are
very
wicked
when
they
do
n't
know
their
own
minds
.
<EOS>
But
if
they
have
n't
known
them
and
have
been
wicked
,
what
can
they
do
but
repent
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Repent
!
"
said
Lady
Macleod
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
;
I
hope
you
will
repent
.
<EOS>
Poor
Mr.
Grey
;
 
<EOS>
what
must
he
think
of
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
only
hope
,
aunt
,
that
he
wo
n't
think
of
it
at
all
for
very
long
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
nonsense
,
my
dear
,
Of
course
he
'll
think
of
it
,
and
of
course
you
'll
marry
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
,
aunt
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
you
will
.
<EOS>
Why
,
Alice
,
has
n't
it
been
all
settled
among
families
?
<EOS>
Lady
Midlothian
knew
all
the
particulars
of
it
just
as
well
as
I
did
.
<EOS>
And
is
not
your
word
pledged
to
him
?
<EOS>
I
really
do
n't
understand
what
you
mean
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
see
how
it
is
possible
you
should
go
back
.
<EOS>
Gentlemen
when
they
do
that
kind
of
thing
are
put
out
of
society
;
 
but
I
really
think
it
is
worse
in
a
woman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
they
may
if
they
please
put
me
out
of
society
;
 
only
that
I
do
n't
know
that
I
'm
particularly
in
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
the
wickedness
of
the
thing
,
Alice
!
<EOS>
I
'm
obliged
to
say
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
When
you
talk
to
me
about
society
,
aunt
,
and
about
Lady
Midlothian
,
I
give
up
to
you
,
willingly
;
 
the
more
willingly
,
perhaps
,
because
I
do
n't
care
much
for
one
or
the
other
.
"
<EOS>
Here
Lady
Macleod
tried
to
say
a
word
;
but
she
failed
,
and
Alice
went
on
,
boldly
looking
up
into
her
aunt
's
face
,
which
became
a
shade
more
bitter
than
ever
.
"
<EOS>
But
when
you
tell
me
about
wickedness
and
my
conscience
,
then
I
must
be
my
own
judge
.
<EOS>
It
is
my
conscience
,
and
the
fear
of
committing
wickedness
,
that
has
made
me
do
this
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
should
submit
to
be
guided
by
your
elders
,
Alice
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
my
elders
in
such
a
matter
as
this
can
not
teach
me
.
<EOS>
It
can
not
be
right
that
I
should
go
to
a
man
's
house
and
be
his
wife
,
if
I
do
not
think
that
I
can
make
him
happy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
why
did
you
accept
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Because
I
was
mistaken
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
going
to
defend
that
.
<EOS>
If
you
choose
to
scold
me
for
that
,
you
may
do
so
,
aunt
,
and
I
will
not
answer
you
.
<EOS>
But
as
to
marrying
him
or
not
marrying
him
now
,
 
as
to
that
,
I
must
judge
for
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
a
pity
<EOS>
you
did
not
know
your
own
mind
earlier
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
a
pity
,
 
a
great
pity
.
<EOS>
I
have
done
myself
an
injury
that
is
quite
irretrievable
;
 
I
know
that
,
and
am
prepared
to
bear
it
.
<EOS>
I
have
done
him
,
too
,
an
injustice
which
I
regret
with
my
whole
heart
.
<EOS>
I
can
only
excuse
myself
by
saying
that
I
might
have
done
him
a
worse
injustice
.
"
  
<EOS>
All
this
was
said
at
the
very
moment
of
her
arrival
,
and
the
greeting
did
not
seem
to
promise
much
for
the
happiness
of
the
next
month
;
but
perhaps
it
was
better
for
them
both
that
the
attack
and
the
defence
should
thus
be
made
suddenly
,
at
their
first
meeting
.
<EOS>
It
is
better
to
pull
the
string
at
once
when
you
are
in
the
shower
-
bath
,
and
not
to
stand
shivering
,
thinking
of
the
inevitable
shock
which
you
can
only
postpone
for
a
few
minutes
.
<EOS>
Lady
Macleod
in
this
case
had
pulled
the
string
,
and
thus
reaped
the
advantage
of
her
alacrity
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
my
dear
,
"
said
her
ladyship
,
"
I
suppose
you
will
like
to
go
up
-
stairs
and
take
off
your
bonnet
.
<EOS>
Mary
shall
bring
you
some
tea
when
you
come
down
.
"
<EOS>
So
Alice
escaped
,
and
when
she
returned
to
the
comfort
of
her
cup
of
tea
in
the
drawing
-
room
,
the
fury
of
the
storm
had
passed
away
.
<EOS>
She
sat
talking
of
other
things
till
dinner
;
and
though
Lady
Macleod
did
during
the
evening
make
one
allusion
to
"
poor
Mr.
Grey
,
"
the
subject
was
allowed
to
drop
.
<EOS>
Alice
was
very
tender
as
to
her
aunt
's
ailments
,
was
more
than
ordinarily
attentive
to
the
long
list
of
Cheltenham
iniquities
which
was
displayed
to
her
,
and
refrained
from
combating
any
of
her
aunt
's
religious
views
.
<EOS>
After
a
while
they
got
upon
the
subject
of
Aunt
Greenow
,
for
whose
name
Lady
Macleod
had
a
special
aversion
,
 
as
indeed
<EOS>
she
had
for
all
the
Vavasor
side
of
Alice
's
family
;
and
then
Alice
offered
to
read
,
and
did
read
to
her
aunt
many
pages
out
of
one
of
those
terrible
books
of
wrath
,
which
from
time
to
time
come
forth
and
tell
us
that
there
is
no
hope
for
us
.
<EOS>
Lady
Macleod
liked
to
be
so
told
;
and
as
she
now
,
poor
woman
,
could
not
read
at
nights
herself
,
she
enjoyed
her
evening
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Macleod
no
doubt
did
enjoy
her
niece
's
sojourn
at
Cheltenham
,
but
I
do
not
think
it
could
have
been
pleasant
to
Alice
.
<EOS>
On
the
second
day
nothing
was
said
about
Mr.
Grey
,
and
Alice
hoped
that
by
her
continual
readings
in
the
book
of
wrath
<EOS>
her
aunt
's
heart
might
be
softened
towards
her
.
<EOS>
But
it
seemed
that
Lady
Macleod
measured
the
periods
of
respite
,
for
on
the
third
day
and
on
the
fifth
she
returned
to
the
attack
.
"
<EOS>
Did
John
Grey
still
wish
that
the
match
should
go
on
?
"
<EOS>
she
asked
,
categorically
.
<EOS>
It
was
in
vain
that
Alice
tried
to
put
aside
the
question
,
and
begged
that
the
matter
might
not
be
discussed
.
<EOS>
Lady
Macleod
insisted
on
her
right
to
carry
on
the
examination
,
and
Alice
was
driven
to
acknowledge
that
she
believed
he
did
wish
it
.
<EOS>
She
could
hardly
say
otherwise
,
seeing
that
she
had
at
that
moment
a
letter
from
him
in
her
pocket
,
in
which
he
still
spoke
of
his
engagement
as
being
absolutely
binding
on
him
,
and
expressed
a
hope
that
this
change
from
London
to
Cheltenham
would
bring
her
round
and
set
everything
to
rights
.
<EOS>
He
certainly
did
,
in
a
fashion
,
wave
his
hand
over
her
,
as
Kate
had
said
of
him
.
<EOS>
This
letter
Alice
had
resolved
that
she
would
not
answer
.
<EOS>
He
would
probably
write
again
,
and
she
would
beg
him
to
desist
.
<EOS>
Instead
of
Cheltenham
bringing
her
round
,
Cheltenham
had
made
her
firmer
than
ever
in
her
resolution
.
<EOS>
I
am
inclined
to
think
that
the
best
mode
of
bringing
her
round
at
this
moment
would
have
been
a
course
of
visits
from
her
cousin
George
,
and
a
series
of
letters
from
her
cousin
Kate
.
<EOS>
Lady
Macleod
's
injunctions
would
certainly
not
bring
her
round
.
  
<EOS>
After
ten
days
,
ten
terrible
days
,
devoted
to
discussions
on
matrimony
in
the
morning
,
and
to
the
book
of
wrath
in
the
evening
,
 
relieved
by
two
tea
-
parties
,
in
which
the
sins
of
Cheltenham
were
discussed
at
length
,
 
Lady
Macleod
herself
got
a
letter
from
Mr.
Grey
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Grey
's
kindest
compliments
to
Lady
Macleod
.
<EOS>
He
believed
that
Lady
Macleod
was
aware
of
the
circumstances
of
his
engagement
with
Miss
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
Might
he
call
on
Miss
Vavasor
at
Lady
Macleod
's
house
in
Cheltenham
?
<EOS>
and
might
he
also
hope
to
have
the
pleasure
of
making
Lady
Macleod
's
acquaintance
?
<EOS>
Alice
had
been
in
the
room
when
her
aunt
received
this
letter
,
but
her
aunt
had
said
nothing
,
and
Alice
had
not
known
from
whom
the
letter
had
come
.
<EOS>
When
her
aunt
crept
away
with
it
after
breakfast
she
had
suspected
nothing
,
and
had
never
imagined
that
Lady
Macleod
,
in
the
privacy
of
her
own
room
looking
out
upon
the
stables
,
had
addressed
a
letter
to
Nethercoats
.
<EOS>
But
such
a
letter
had
been
addressed
to
Nethercoats
,
and
Mr.
Grey
had
been
informed
that
he
would
be
received
in
Paramount
Crescent
with
great
pleasure
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Grey
had
even
indicated
the
day
on
which
he
would
come
,
and
on
the
morning
of
that
day
Lady
Macleod
had
presided
over
the
two
teacups
in
a
state
of
nervous
excitement
which
was
quite
visible
to
Alice
.
<EOS>
More
than
once
Alice
asked
little
questions
,
not
supposing
that
she
was
specially
concerned
in
the
matter
which
had
caused
her
aunt
's
fidgety
restlessness
,
but
observing
it
so
plainly
that
it
was
almost
impossible
not
to
allude
to
it
.
<EOS>
"
There
's
nothing
the
matter
,
my
dear
,
at
all
,
"
at
last
Lady
Macleod
said
;
but
as
she
said
so
she
was
making
up
her
mind
that
the
moment
had
not
come
in
which
she
must
apprise
Alice
of
Mr.
Grey
's
intended
visit
.
<EOS>
As
Alice
had
questioned
her
at
the
breakfast
table
she
would
say
nothing
about
it
then
,
but
waited
till
the
teacups
were
withdrawn
,
and
till
the
maid
had
given
her
last
officious
poke
to
the
fire
.
<EOS>
Then
she
began
.
<EOS>
She
had
Mr.
Grey
's
letter
in
her
pocket
,
and
as
she
prepared
herself
to
speak
,
she
pulled
it
out
and
held
it
on
the
little
table
before
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Alice
<EOS>
,
"
she
said
,
"
I
expect
a
visitor
here
to
-
day
.
"
  
<EOS>
Alice
knew
instantly
who
was
the
expected
visitor
.
<EOS>
Probably
any
girl
under
such
circumstances
would
have
known
equally
well
.
"
<EOS>
A
visitor
,
aunt
,
"
she
said
,
and
managed
to
hide
her
knowledge
admirably
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Alice
a
visitor
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
told
you
before
,
only
I
thought
,
 
I
thought
I
had
better
not
.
<EOS>
It
is
Mr.
 
Mr.
Grey
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
,
aunt
!
<EOS>
Is
he
coming
to
see
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
;
 
he
is
desirous
no
doubt
of
seeing
you
more
especially
;
but
he
has
expressed
a
wish
to
make
my
acquaintance
,
which
I
can
not
,
under
the
circumstances
,
think
is
unnatural
.
<EOS>
Of
course
,
Alice
,
he
must
want
to
talk
over
this
affair
with
your
friends
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
could
have
spared
them
,
"
said
Alice
,
 
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
could
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
brought
his
letter
here
,
and
you
can
see
it
if
you
please
.
<EOS>
It
is
very
nicely
written
,
and
as
far
as
I
am
concerned
I
should
not
think
of
refusing
to
see
him
.
<EOS>
And
now
comes
the
question
.
<EOS>
What
are
we
to
do
with
him
?
<EOS>
Am
I
to
ask
him
to
dinner
?
<EOS>
I
take
it
for
granted
that
he
will
not
expect
me
to
offer
him
a
bed
,
as
he
knows
that
I
live
in
lodgings
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
no
,
aunt
;
he
certainly
will
not
expect
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
ought
I
to
ask
him
to
dinner
?
<EOS>
I
should
be
most
happy
to
entertain
him
,
though
you
know
how
very
scanty
<EOS>
my
means
of
doing
so
are
;
 
but
<EOS>
I
really
do
not
know
how
it
might
be
,
 
between
you
and
him
,
I
mean
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
We
should
not
fight
,
aunt
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
suppose
not
;
 
but
if
you
can
not
be
affectionate
in
your
manner
to
him
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
will
not
answer
for
my
manners
,
aunt
;
but
you
may
be
sure
of
this
,
 
that
I
should
be
affectionate
in
my
heart
.
<EOS>
I
shall
always
regard
him
as
a
dearly
loved
friend
;
though
for
many
years
,
no
doubt
,
I
shall
be
unable
to
express
my
friendship
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
may
be
all
very
well
,
Alice
,
but
it
will
not
be
what
he
will
want
.
<EOS>
I
think
upon
the
whole
that
I
had
better
not
ask
him
to
dinner
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
not
,
aunt
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
period
of
the
day
in
which
any
special
constraint
among
people
is
more
disagreeable
than
at
any
other
time
,
and
then
at
dinner
the
servants
must
see
it
.
<EOS>
I
think
there
might
be
some
awkwardness
if
he
were
to
dine
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
really
think
there
would
,
"
said
Alice
,
anxious
to
have
the
subject
dropped
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
he
wo
n't
think
that
I
am
inhospitable
.
<EOS>
I
should
be
so
happy
to
do
the
best
I
could
for
him
,
for
I
regard
him
,
Alice
,
quite
as
though
he
were
to
be
your
husband
.
<EOS>
And
when
anybody
at
all
connected
with
me
has
come
to
Cheltenham
<EOS>
I
always
have
asked
them
to
dine
,
and
then
I
have
Gubbins
's
man
to
come
and
wait
at
table
,
 
as
you
know

"
Of
all
men
in
the
world
<EOS>
Mr.
Grey
is
the
last
to
think
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
should
only
make
me
the
more
careful
.
<EOS>
But
I
think
it
would
perhaps
be
more
comfortable
if
he
were
to
come
in
the
evening
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Much
more
comfortable
,
aunt
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
he
will
be
here
in
the
afternoon
,
before
dinner
,
and
we
had
better
wait
at
home
for
him
.
<EOS>
I
dare
say
he
'll
want
to
see
you
alone
,
and
therefore
I
'll
retire
to
my
own
rooms
,
"
 
looking
over
the
stables
!
<EOS>
Dear
old
lady
.
<EOS>
"
But
if
you
wish
it
,
I
will
receive
him
first
 
<EOS>
and
then
Martha
,
"
 
<EOS>
Martha
was
Alice
's
maid
 
"
can
fetch
you
down
.

<EOS>
This
discussion
as
to
the
propriety
or
impropriety
of
giving
her
lover
a
dinner
had
not
been
pleasant
to
Alice
,
but
,
nevertheless
,
when
it
was
over
she
felt
grateful
to
Lady
Macleod
.
<EOS>
There
was
an
attempt
in
the
arrangement
to
make
Mr.
Grey
's
visit
as
little
painful
as
possible
;
and
though
such
a
discussion
at
such
a
time
might
as
well
have
been
avoided
,
the
decision
to
which
her
ladyship
had
at
last
come
with
reference
both
to
the
dinner
and
the
management
of
the
visit
<EOS>
was
,
no
doubt
,
the
right
one
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Macleod
had
been
quite
correct
in
all
her
anticipations
.
<EOS>
At
three
o'clock
Mr.
Grey
was
announced
,
and
Lady
Macleod
,
alone
,
received
him
in
her
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
She
had
intended
to
give
him
a
great
deal
of
good
advice
,
to
bid
him
still
keep
up
his
heart
and
as
it
were
hold
up
his
head
,
to
confess
to
him
how
very
badly
Alice
was
behaving
,
and
to
express
her
entire
concurrence
with
that
theory
of
bodily
ailment
as
the
cause
and
origin
of
her
conduct
.
<EOS>
But
she
found
that
Mr.
Grey
was
a
man
to
whom
she
could
not
give
much
advice
.
<EOS>
It
was
he
who
did
the
speaking
at
this
conference
,
and
not
she
.
<EOS>
She
was
overawed
by
him
after
the
first
three
minutes
.
<EOS>
Indeed
her
first
glance
at
him
had
awed
her
.
<EOS>
He
was
so
handsome
,
 
and
<EOS>
then
,
in
his
beauty
,
he
had
so
quiet
and
almost
saddened
an
air
!
<EOS>
Strange
to
say
that
after
she
had
seen
him
,
Lady
Macleod
entertained
for
him
an
infinitely
higher
admiration
than
before
,
and
yet
she
was
less
surprised
than
she
had
been
at
Alice
's
refusal
of
him
.
<EOS>
The
conference
was
very
short
;
and
Mr.
Grey
had
not
been
a
quarter
of
an
hour
in
the
house
before
Martha
attended
upon
her
mistress
with
her
summons
.
  
<EOS>
Alice
was
ready
and
came
down
instantly
.
<EOS>
She
found
Mr.
Grey
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
room
waiting
to
receive
her
,
and
the
look
of
majesty
which
had
cowed
Lady
Macleod
had
gone
from
his
countenance
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
have
received
her
with
a
kinder
smile
,
had
she
come
to
him
with
a
promise
that
she
would
at
this
meeting
name
the
day
for
their
marriage
.
<EOS>
"
At
any
rate
it
does
not
make
him
unhappy
,
"
she
said
to
herself
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
not
angry
,
"
he
said
,
"
that
I
should
have
followed
you
all
the
way
here
,
to
see
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
certainly
;
not
angry
,
Mr.
Grey
.
<EOS>
All
anger
that
there
may
be
between
us
must
be
on
your
side
.
<EOS>
I
feel
that
thoroughly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
there
shall
be
none
on
either
side
.
<EOS>
Whatever
may
be
done
,
I
will
not
be
angry
with
you
.
<EOS>
Your
father
advised
me
to
come
down
here
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
seen
him
,
then
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
have
seen
him
.
<EOS>
I
was
in
London
the
day
you
left
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
so
terrible
to
think
that
I
should
have
brought
upon
you
all
this
trouble
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
bring
upon
me
much
worse
trouble
than
that
unless
 
.
<EOS>
But
I
have
not
now
come
down
here
to
tell
you
that
.
<EOS>
I
believe
that
according
to
rule
in
such
matters
I
should
not
have
come
to
you
at
all
,
but
I
do
n't
know
that
I
care
much
about
such
rules
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
I
that
have
broken
all
rules
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
When
a
lady
tells
a
gentleman
that
she
does
not
wish
to
see
more
of
him
 
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Mr.
Grey
,
I
have
not
told
you
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Have
you
not
?
<EOS>
I
am
glad
at
any
rate
to
hear
you
deny
it
.
<EOS>
But
you
will
understand
what
I
mean
.
<EOS>
When
a
gentleman
gets
his
dismissal
from
a
lady
he
should
accept
it
,
 
<EOS>
that
is
,
his
dismissal
under
such
circumstances
as
I
have
received
mine
.
<EOS>
But
I
can
not
lay
down
my
love
in
that
way
;
nor
,
maintaining
my
love
,
can
I
give
up
the
battle
.
<EOS>
It
seems
to
me
that
I
have
a
right
at
any
rate
to
know
something
of
your
comings
and
goings
as
long
as
,
 
unless
,
Alice
,
you
should
take
another
name
than
mine
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
intention
is
to
keep
my
own
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
This
she
said
in
the
lowest
possible
tone
,
 
almost
in
a
whisper
,
 
with
her
eyes
fixed
upon
the
ground
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
will
not
deny
me
that
right
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
hinder
you
.
<EOS>
Whatever
you
may
do
,
I
myself
have
sinned
so
against
you
that
I
can
have
no
right
to
blame
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
shall
be
no
question
between
us
of
injury
from
one
to
the
other
.
<EOS>
In
any
conversation
that
we
may
have
,
or
in
any
correspondence
 
"
  
"
Oh
,
Mr.
Grey
,
do
not
ask
me
to
write
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Listen
to
me
.
<EOS>
Should
there
be
any
on
either
side
<EOS>
,
there
shall
be
no
idea
of
any
wrong
done
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
have
done
you
wrong
;
 
great
wrong
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
Alice
;
I
will
not
have
it
so
.
<EOS>
When
I
asked
you
to
accept
my
hand
,
 
begging
the
greatest
boon
which
it
could
ever
come
to
my
lot
to
ask
from
a
fellow
-
mortal
,
 
I
knew
well
how
great
was
your
goodness
to
me
when
you
told
me
that
it
should
be
mine
.
<EOS>
Now
that
you
refuse
it
,
I
know
also
that
you
are
good
,
thinking
that
in
doing
so
you
are
acting
for
my
welfare
,
 
thinking
more
of
my
welfare
than
of
your
own
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
yes
,
yes
;
it
is
so
,
Mr.
Grey
;
indeed
it
is
so
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Believing
that
,
how
can
I
talk
of
wrong
?
<EOS>
That
you
are
wrong
in
your
thinking
on
this
subject
,
 
that
your
mind
has
become
twisted
by
false
impressions
,
 
that
I
believe
.
<EOS>
But
I
can
not
therefore
love
you
less
,
 
nor
,
so
believing
,
can
I
consider
myself
to
be
injured
.
<EOS>
Nor
am
I
even
so
little
selfish
as
you
are
.
<EOS>
I
think
if
you
were
my
wife
that
I
could
make
you
happy
;
but
I
feel
sure
that
my
happiness
depends
on
your
being
my
wife
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
looked
up
into
his
face
,
but
it
was
still
serene
in
all
its
manly
beauty
.
<EOS>
Her
cousin
George
,
if
he
were
moved
to
strong
feeling
,
showed
it
at
once
in
his
eyes
,
 
in
his
mouth
,
in
the
whole
visage
of
his
countenance
.
<EOS>
He
glared
in
his
anger
,
and
was
impassioned
in
his
love
.
<EOS>
But
Mr.
Grey
when
speaking
of
the
happiness
of
his
entire
life
,
when
confessing
that
it
was
now
at
stake
with
a
decision
against
him
that
would
be
ruinous
to
it
,
spoke
without
a
quiver
in
his
voice
,
and
had
no
more
sign
of
passion
in
his
face
than
if
he
were
telling
his
gardener
to
move
a
rose
tree
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
 
and
believe
that
you
will
find
your
happiness
elsewhere
,
Mr.
Grey
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
;
we
can
but
differ
,
Alice
.
<EOS>
In
that
we
do
differ
.
<EOS>
And
now
I
will
say
one
word
to
explain
why
I
have
come
here
.
<EOS>
If
I
were
to
write
to
you
against
your
will
,
it
would
seem
that
I
were
persecuting
you
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
bring
myself
to
do
that
,
even
though
I
had
the
right
.
<EOS>
But
if
I
were
to
let
you
go
from
me
,
taking
what
you
have
said
to
me
and
doing
nothing
,
it
would
seem
that
I
had
accepted
your
decision
as
final
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
do
so
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
do
so
.
<EOS>
I
come
simply
to
tell
you
that
I
am
still
your
suitor
.
<EOS>
If
you
will
let
me
,
I
will
see
you
again
early
in
January
,
 
as
soon
as
you
have
returned
to
town
.
<EOS>
You
will
hardly
refuse
to
see
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
she
said
;
"
I
can
not
refuse
to
see
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
it
shall
be
so
,
"
he
said
,
"
and
I
will
not
trouble
you
with
letters
,
nor
will
I
trouble
you
longer
now
with
words
.
<EOS>
Tell
your
aunt
that
I
have
said
what
I
came
to
say
,
and
that
I
give
her
my
kindest
thanks
.
"
<EOS>
Then
he
took
her
hand
and
pressed
it
,
 
not
as
George
Vavasor
had
pressed
it
,
 
and
was
gone
.
<EOS>
When
Lady
Macleod
returned
,
she
found
that
the
question
of
the
evening
's
tea
arrangements
had
settled
itself
.
   
<EOS>
The
Roebury
Club
.
 
<EOS>
It
has
been
said
that
George
Vavasor
had
a
little
establishment
at
Roebury
,
down
in
Oxfordshire
,
and
thither
he
betook
himself
about
the
middle
of
November
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
long
known
in
this
county
,
and
whether
or
no
men
spoke
well
of
him
as
a
man
of
business
in
London
,
men
spoke
well
of
him
down
there
,
as
one
who
knew
how
to
ride
to
hounds
.
<EOS>
Not
that
Vavasor
was
popular
among
fellow
-
sportsmen
.
<EOS>
It
was
quite
otherwise
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
a
man
that
made
himself
really
popular
in
any
social
meetings
of
men
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
himself
care
for
the
loose
little
talkings
,
half
flat
and
half
sharp
,
of
men
when
they
meet
together
in
idleness
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
open
enough
in
his
nature
for
such
popularity
.
<EOS>
Some
men
were
afraid
of
him
,
and
some
suspected
him
.
<EOS>
There
were
others
who
made
up
to
him
,
seeking
his
intimacy
,
but
these
he
usually
snubbed
,
and
always
kept
at
a
distance
.
<EOS>
Though
he
had
indulged
in
all
the
ordinary
pleasures
of
young
men
,
he
had
never
been
a
jovial
man
.
<EOS>
In
his
conversations
with
men
he
always
seemed
to
think
that
he
should
use
his
time
towards
serving
some
purpose
of
business
.
<EOS>
With
women
he
was
quite
the
reverse
.
<EOS>
With
women
he
could
be
happy
.
<EOS>
With
women
he
could
really
associate
.
<EOS>
A
woman
he
could
really
love
;
 
<EOS>
but
I
doubt
whether
for
all
that
he
could
treat
a
woman
well
.
  
<EOS>
But
he
was
known
in
the
Oxfordshire
country
as
a
man
who
knew
what
he
was
about
,
and
such
men
are
always
welcome
.
<EOS>
It
is
the
man
who
does
not
know
how
to
ride
that
is
made
uncomfortable
in
the
hunting
field
by
cold
looks
or
expressed
censure
.
<EOS>
And
yet
it
is
very
rarely
that
such
men
do
any
real
harm
.
<EOS>
Such
a
one
may
now
and
then
get
among
the
hounds
or
override
the
hunt
,
but
it
is
not
often
so
.
<EOS>
Many
such
complaints
are
made
;
but
in
truth
the
too
forward
man
,
who
presses
the
dogs
,
is
generally
one
who
can
ride
,
but
is
too
eager
or
too
selfish
to
keep
in
his
proper
place
.
<EOS>
The
bad
rider
,
like
the
bad
whist
player
,
pays
highly
for
what
he
does
not
enjoy
,
and
should
be
thanked
.
<EOS>
But
at
both
games
he
gets
cruelly
snubbed
.
<EOS>
At
both
games
George
Vavasor
was
great
and
he
never
got
snubbed
.
  
<EOS>
There
were
men
who
lived
together
at
Roebury
in
a
kind
of
club
,
 
four
or
five
of
them
,
who
came
thither
from
London
,
running
backwards
and
forwards
as
hunting
arrangements
enabled
them
to
do
so
,
 
a
brewer
or
two
and
a
banker
,
with
a
would
-
be
fast
attorney
,
a
sporting
literary
gentleman
,
and
a
young
unmarried
Member
of
Parliament
who
had
no
particular
home
of
his
own
in
the
country
.
<EOS>
These
men
formed
the
Roebury
Club
,
and
a
jolly
life
they
had
of
it
.
<EOS>
They
had
their
own
wine
closet
at
the
King
's
Head
,
 
or
Roebury
Inn
as
the
house
had
come
to
be
popularly
called
,
 
and
supplied
their
own
game
.
<EOS>
The
landlord
found
everything
else
;
and
as
they
were
not
very
particular
about
their
bills
,
they
were
allowed
to
do
pretty
much
as
they
liked
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
They
were
rather
imperious
,
very
late
in
their
hours
,
sometimes
,
though
not
often
,
noisy
,
and
once
there
had
been
a
hasty
quarrel
which
had
made
the
landlord
in
his
anger
<EOS>
say
that
the
club
should
be
turned
out
of
his
house
.
<EOS>
But
they
paid
well
,
chaffed
the
servants
much
oftener
than
they
bullied
them
,
and
on
the
whole
were
very
popular
.
  
<EOS>
To
this
club
Vavasor
did
not
belong
,
alleging
that
he
could
not
afford
to
live
at
their
pace
,
and
alleging
,
also
,
that
his
stays
at
Roebury
were
not
long
enough
to
make
him
a
desirable
member
.
<EOS>
The
invitation
to
him
was
not
repeated
and
he
lodged
elsewhere
in
the
little
town
.
<EOS>
But
he
occasionally
went
in
of
an
evening
,
and
would
make
up
with
the
members
a
table
at
whist
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
come
down
to
Roebury
by
mail
train
,
ready
for
hunting
the
next
morning
,
and
walked
into
the
club
-
room
just
at
midnight
.
<EOS>
There
he
found
Maxwell
the
banker
,
Grindley
the
would
-
be
fast
attorney
,
and
Calder
Jones
the
Member
of
Parliament
,
playing
dummy
.
<EOS>
Neither
of
the
brewers
were
there
,
nor
was
the
sporting
literary
gentleman
.
  
<EOS>
"
Here
's
Vavasor
,
"
said
Maxwell
,
"
and
now
we
wo
n't
play
this
blackguard
game
any
longer
.
<EOS>
Somebody
told
me
,
Vavasor
,
that
you
were
gone
away
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Gone
away
;
 
what
,
like
a
fox
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
what
it
was
;
that
something
had
happened
to
you
since
last
season
;
that
you
were
married
,
or
dead
,
or
gone
abroad
.
<EOS>
By
George
,
I
've
lost
the
trick
after
all
!
<EOS>
I
hate
dummy
like
the
devil
.
<EOS>
I
never
hold
a
card
in
dummy
's
hand
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
I
know
;
that
's
seven
points
on
each
side
.
<EOS>
Vavasor
,
come
and
cut
.
<EOS>
Upon
my
word
if
any
one
had
asked
me
,
I
should
have
said
you
were
dead
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
see
,
nobody
ever
does
think
of
asking
you
anything
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
you
probably
mean
,
"
said
Grindley
,
"
is
that
Vavasor
was
not
returned
for
Chelsea
last
February
;
but
you
've
seen
him
since
that
.
<EOS>
Are
you
going
to
try
it
again
,
Vavasor
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
'll
lend
me
the
money
I
will
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
see
what
on
earth
a
man
gains
by
going
into
the
house
,
"
said
Calder
Jones
.
<EOS>
"
I
could
n't
help
myself
as
it
happened
,
but
,
upon
my
word
it
's
a
deuce
of
a
bore
.
<EOS>
A
fellow
thinks
he
can
do
as
he
likes
about
going
,
 
but
he
ca
n't
.
<EOS>
It
would
n't
do
for
me
to
give
it
up
,
because
 
"
  
"
Oh
no
,
of
course
not
;
where
should
we
all
be
?
"
said
Vavasor
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's

<EOS>
"
D
 
---
parliament
,
and
now
let
's
have
a
rubber
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
They
played
till
three
and
Mr.
Calder
Jones
lost
a
good
deal
of
money
,
 
a
good
deal
of
money
in
a
little
way
,
for
they
never
played
above
ten
-
shilling
points
,
and
no
bet
was
made
for
more
than
a
pound
or
two
.
<EOS>
But
Vavasor
was
the
winner
,
and
when
he
left
the
room
he
became
the
subject
of
some
ill
-
natured
remarks
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
he
likes
coming
in
here
,
"
said
Grindley
,
who
had
himself
been
the
man
to
invite
him
to
belong
to
the
club
,
and
who
had
at
one
time
indulged
the
ambition
of
an
intimacy
with
George
Vavasor
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
understand
it
,
"
said
Calder
Jones
,
who
was
a
little
bitter
about
his
money
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Last
year
he
seemed
to
walk
in
just
when
he
liked
,
as
though
he
were
one
of
us
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
's
a
bad
sort
of
fellow
,
"
said
Grindley
;
"
he
's
so
uncommonly
dark
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
where
on
earth
he
gets
his
money
from
,
He
was
heir
to
some
small
property
in
the
north
,
but
he
lost
every
shilling
of
that
when
he
was
in
the
wine
trade
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
're
wrong
there
,
Grindems
,
"
said
Maxwell
,
 
making
use
of
a
playful
nickname
which
he
had
invented
for
his
friend
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
made
a
pot
of
money
at
the
wine
business
,
and
had
he
stuck
to
it
he
would
have
been
a
rich
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
's
lost
it
all
since
then
,
and
that
place
in
the
north
into
the
bargain
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Wrong
again
,
Grindems
,
my
boy
.
<EOS>
If
old
Vavasor
were
to
die
to
-
morrow
,
Vavasor
Hall
would
go
just
as
he
might
choose
to
leave
it
.
<EOS>
George
may
be
a
ruined
man
for
aught
<EOS>
I
know
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
There
's
no
doubt
about
that
,
I
believe
,
"
said
Grindley
.
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
not
,
Grindems
;
but
he
ca
n't
have
lost
Vavasor
Hall
because
he
has
never
as
yet
had
an
interest
in
it
.
<EOS>
He
's
the
natural
heir
,
and
will
probably
get
it
some
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
All
the
same
,
"
said
Calder
Jones
,
"
is
n't
it
rather
odd
<EOS>
he
should
come
in
here
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
've
asked
him
often
enough
,
"
said
Maxwell
;
"
not
because
we
like
him
,
but
because
we
want
him
so
often
to
make
up
a
rubber
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
like
George
Vavasor
,
and
I
do
n't
know
who
does
;
but
I
like
him
better
than
dummy
.
<EOS>
And
I
'd
sooner
play
whist
with
men
<EOS>
I
do
n't
like
,
Grindems
,
than
I
'd
not
play
at
all
.
"
<EOS>
A
bystander
might
have
thought
from
the
tone
of
Mr.
Maxwell
's
voice
that
he
was
alluding
to
Mr.
Grindley
himself
,
but
Mr.
Grindley
did
n't
seem
to
take
it
in
that
light
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
true
,
of
course
,
"
said
he
.
<EOS>
"
We
ca
n't
pick
men
just
as
we
please
.
<EOS>
But
I
certainly
did
n't
think
that
he
'd
make
it
out
for
another
season
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
club
breakfasted
the
next
morning
at
nine
o'clock
,
in
order
that
they
might
start
at
half
-
past
for
the
meet
at
Edgehill
.
<EOS>
Edgehill
is
twelve
miles
from
Roebury
,
and
the
hacks
would
do
it
in
an
hour
and
a
half
,
 
or
perhaps
a
little
less
.
"
<EOS>
Does
anybody
know
anything
about
that
brown
horse
of
Vavasor
's
?
"
said
Maxwell
.
<EOS>
"
I
saw
him
coming
into
the
yard
yesterday
with
that
old
groom
of
his
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
had
a
brown
horse
last
season
,
"
said
Grindley
;
 
"
a
little
thing
that
went
very
fast
,
but
was
n't
quite
sound
on
the
road
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
was
a
mare
,
"
said
Maxwell
,
"
and
he
sold
her
to
Cinquebars
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
*
  
"
For
a
hundred
and
fifty
,
"
said
Calder
Jones
,
"
and
she
was
n't
worth
the
odd
fifty
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
won
seventy
with
her
at
Leamington
,
"
said
Maxwell
,
"
and
I
doubt
whether
he
'd
take
his
money
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Is
Cinquebars
coming
down
here
this
year
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
,
"
said
Maxwell
.
<EOS>
"
I
hope
not
.
<EOS>
He
's
the
best
fellow
in
the
world
,
but
he
ca
n't
ride
,
and
he
do
n't
care
for
hunting
,
and
he
makes
more
row
than
any
fellow
I
ever
met
.
<EOS>
I
wish
some
fellow
could
tell
me
something
about
that
fellow
's
brown
horse
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'd
never
buy
a
horse
of
Vavasor
's
if
I
were
you
,
"
said
Grindley
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
never
has
anything
that
's
all
right
all
round
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
who
has
?
"
said
Maxwell
,
as
he
took
into
his
plate
a
second
mutton
chop
,
which
had
just
been
brought
up
hot
into
the
room
especially
for
him
.
<EOS>
"
That
's
the
mistake
men
make
about
horses
,
and
that
's
why
there
's
so
much
cheating
.
<EOS>
I
never
ask
for
a
warranty
with
a
horse
,
and
do
n't
very
often
have
a
horse
examined
.
<EOS>
Yet
I
do
as
well
as
others
.
<EOS>
You
ca
n't
have
perfect
horses
any
more
than
you
can
perfect
men
,
or
perfect
women
.
<EOS>
You
put
up
with
red
hair
,
or
bad
teeth
,
or
big
feet
,
 
or
sometimes
with
the
devil
of
a
voice
.
<EOS>
But
a
man
when
he
wants
a
horse
wo
n't
put
up
with
anything
!
<EOS>
Therefore
those
who
've
got
horses
to
sell
must
lie
.
<EOS>
When
I
go
into
the
market
with
three
hundred
pounds
I
expect
a
perfect
animal
.
<EOS>
As
I
never
do
that
now
I
never
expect
a
perfect
animal
.
<EOS>
I
like
"
em
to
see
;
I
like
"
<EOS>
em
to
have
four
legs
;
and
I
like
"
em
to
have
a
little
wind
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
much
mind
anything
else
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
By
Jove
you
're
about
right
,
"
said
Calder
Jones
.
<EOS>
The
reader
will
therefore
readily
see
that
Mr.
Maxwell
the
banker
reigned
as
king
in
that
club
.
  
<EOS>
Vavasor
had
sent
two
horses
on
in
charge
of
Bat
Smithers
,
and
followed
on
a
pony
about
fourteen
hands
high
,
which
he
had
ridden
as
a
cover
hack
for
the
last
four
years
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
start
till
near
ten
,
but
he
was
able
to
catch
Bat
with
his
two
horses
about
a
mile
and
a
half
on
that
side
of
Edgehill
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Have
you
managed
to
come
along
pretty
clean
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
master
asked
as
he
came
up
with
his
servant
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
be
the
most
beastly
roads
in
all
England
,
"
said
Bat
,
who
always
found
fault
with
any
county
in
which
he
happened
to
be
located
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
'll
warrant
I
'm
cleaner
than
most
on
"
em
.
<EOS>
What
for
any
county
should
make
such
roads
as
them
<EOS>
I
never
could
tell
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
The
roads
about
there
are
bad
,
certainly
;
 
very
bad
.
<EOS>
But
I
suppose
they
would
have
been
better
had
Providence
sent
better
materials
.
<EOS>
And
what
do
you
think
of
the
brown
horse
,
Bat
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
said
no
more
,
and
that
he
said
with
a
drawl
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
's
as
fine
an
animal
to
look
at
as
ever
<EOS>
I
put
my
eye
on
,
"
said
George
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
's
all
that
,
"
said
Bat
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
's
got
lots
of
pace
too
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
sure
he
has
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
they
tell
me
you
ca
n't
beat
him
at
jumping
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
They
can
mostly
do
that
,
sir
,
if
they
're
well
handled
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
see
he
's
a
deal
over
my
weight
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
he
is
,
Mr.
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
He
is
a
fourteen
stoner
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Or
fifteen
,
"
said
Vavasor
.
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
he
may
,
sir
.
<EOS>
There
's
no
knowing
what
a
"
orse
can
carry
till
he
's
tried
.
"
  
<EOS>
George
asked
his
groom
no
more
questions
,
but
felt
sure
that
he
had
better
sell
his
brown
horse
if
he
could
.
<EOS>
Now
I
here
protest
that
there
was
nothing
specially
amiss
with
the
brown
horse
.
<EOS>
Towards
the
end
of
the
preceding
season
he
had
overreached
himself
and
had
been
lame
,
and
had
been
sold
by
some
owner
with
more
money
than
brains
who
had
not
cared
to
wait
for
a
cure
.
<EOS>
Then
there
had
gone
with
him
a
bad
character
,
and
a
vague
suspicion
had
attached
itself
to
him
,
as
there
does
to
hundreds
of
horses
which
are
very
good
animals
in
their
way
.
<EOS>
He
had
come
thus
to
Tattersall
's
,
and
Vavasor
had
bought
him
cheap
,
thinking
that
he
might
make
money
of
him
,
from
his
form
and
action
.
<EOS>
He
had
found
nothing
amiss
with
him
,
 
nor
,
indeed
,
had
Bat
Smithers
.
<EOS>
But
his
character
went
with
him
,
and
therefore
Bat
Smithers
thought
it
well
to
be
knowing
.
<EOS>
George
Vavasor
knew
as
much
of
horses
as
most
men
can
,
 
as
,
perhaps
,
as
any
man
can
who
is
not
a
dealer
,
or
a
veterinary
surgeon
;
but
he
,
like
all
men
,
doubted
his
own
knowledge
,
though
on
that
subject
he
would
never
admit
that
he
doubted
it
.
<EOS>
Therefore
he
took
Bat
's
word
and
felt
sure
that
the
horse
was
wrong
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
shall
have
a
run
from
the
big
wood
,
"
said
George
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
they
make
un
break
,
you
will
,
sir
,
"
said
Bat
.
  
<EOS>
"
At
any
rate
I
'll
ride
the
brown
horse
,
"
said
George
.
<EOS>
Then
,
as
soon
as
that
was
settled
between
them
,
the
Roebury
Club
overtook
them
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
now
a
rush
of
horses
on
the
road
altogether
,
and
they
were
within
a
quarter
of
a
mile
of
Edgehill
church
,
close
to
which
was
the
meet
.
<EOS>
Bat
with
his
two
hunters
fell
a
little
behind
,
and
the
others
trotted
on
together
.
<EOS>
The
other
grooms
with
their
animals
were
on
in
advance
,
and
were
by
this
time
employed
in
combing
out
forelocks
,
and
rubbing
stirrup
leathers
and
horses
"
legs
free
from
the
dirt
of
the
roads
;
 
but
Bat
Smithers
was
like
his
master
,
and
did
not
congregate
much
with
other
men
,
and
Vavasor
was
sure
to
give
orders
to
his
servant
different
from
the
orders
given
by
others
.
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
well
mounted
this
year
?
"
<EOS>
Maxwell
asked
of
George
Vavasor
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
indeed
;
I
never
was
what
I
call
well
mounted
yet
.
<EOS>
I
generally
have
one
horse
and
three
or
four
cripples
.
<EOS>
That
brown
horse
behind
there
is
pretty
good
,
I
believe
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
see
your
man
has
got
the
old
chestnut
mare
with
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
's
one
of
the
cripples
,
 
not
but
what
she
's
as
sound
as
a
bell
,
and
as
good
a
hunter
as
ever
I
wish
to
ride
;
but
she
makes
a
little
noise
when
she
's
going
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
So
that
you
can
hear
her
three
fields
off
,
"
said
Grindley
.
  
<EOS>
"
Five
if
the
fields
are
small
enough
and
your
ears
are
sharp
enough
,
"
said
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
"
All
the
same
I
would
n't
change
her
for
the
best
horse
I
ever
saw
under
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Had
you
there
,
Grindems
,
"
said
Maxwell
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
he
did
n't
,
"
said
Grindley
.
<EOS>
"
He
did
n't
have
me
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Your
horses
,
Grindley
,
are
always
up
to
all
the
work
they
have
to
do
,
"
said
George
;
"
<EOS>
and
I
do
n't
know
what
any
man
wants
more
than
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Had
you
again
,
Grindems
,
"
said
Maxwell
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
ride
against
him
any
day
,
"
said
Grindley
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
or
against
a
brick
wall
either
,
if
your
horse
did
n't
know
any
better
,
"
said
George
.
  
<EOS>
"
Had
you
again
,
Grindems
,
"
said
Maxwell
.
<EOS>
Whereupon
Mr.
Grindley
trotted
on
,
round
the
corner
by
the
church
,
and
into
the
field
in
which
the
hounds
were
assembled
.
<EOS>
The
fire
had
become
too
hot
for
him
,
and
he
thought
it
best
to
escape
.
<EOS>
Had
it
been
Vavasor
alone
<EOS>
he
would
have
turned
upon
him
and
snarled
,
but
he
could
not
afford
to
exhibit
any
ill
temper
to
the
king
of
the
club
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Grindley
was
not
popular
,
and
were
Maxwell
to
turn
openly
against
him
his
sporting
life
down
at
Roebury
would
decidedly
be
a
failure
.
  
<EOS>
The
lives
of
such
men
as
Mr.
Grindley
,
 
men
who
are
tolerated
in
the
daily
society
of
others
who
are
accounted
their
superiors
,
do
not
seem
to
have
many
attractions
.
<EOS>
And
yet
how
many
such
men
does
one
see
in
almost
every
set
?
<EOS>
Why
Mr.
Grindley
should
have
been
inferior
to
Mr.
Maxwell
the
banker
,
or
to
Stone
,
or
to
Prettyman
who
were
brewers
,
or
even
to
Mr.
Pollock
<EOS>
the
heavy
-
weight
literary
gentleman
,
I
can
hardly
say
.
<EOS>
An
attorney
by
his
trade
is
at
any
rate
as
good
as
a
brewer
,
and
there
are
many
attorneys
who
hold
their
heads
high
anywhere
.
<EOS>
Grindley
was
a
rich
man
,
 
or
at
any
rate
rich
enough
for
the
life
he
led
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
much
about
his
birth
,
but
I
believe
it
was
as
good
as
Maxwell
's
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
ignorant
,
or
a
fool
;
 
whereas
I
rather
think
Maxwell
was
a
fool
.
<EOS>
Grindley
had
made
his
own
way
in
the
world
,
but
Maxwell
would
certainly
not
have
made
himself
a
banker
if
his
father
had
not
been
a
banker
before
him
;
nor
could
the
bank
have
gone
on
and
prospered
<EOS>
had
there
not
been
partners
there
who
were
better
men
of
business
than
our
friend
.
<EOS>
Grindley
knew
that
he
had
a
better
intellect
than
Maxwell
;
and
yet
he
allowed
Maxwell
to
snub
him
,
and
he
toadied
Maxwell
in
return
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
on
the
score
of
riding
that
Maxwell
claimed
and
held
his
superiority
,
for
Grindley
did
not
want
pluck
,
and
every
one
knew
that
Maxwell
had
lived
freely
and
that
his
nerves
were
not
what
they
had
been
.
<EOS>
I
think
it
had
come
from
the
outward
look
of
the
men
,
from
the
form
of
each
,
from
the
gait
and
visage
which
in
one
was
good
and
in
the
other
insignificant
.
<EOS>
The
nature
of
such
dominion
of
man
over
man
is
very
singular
,
but
this
is
certain
that
when
once
obtained
in
manhood
it
may
be
easily
held
.
  
<EOS>
Among
boys
at
school
the
same
thing
is
even
more
conspicuous
,
because
boys
have
less
of
conscience
than
men
,
are
more
addicted
to
tyranny
,
and
when
weak
are
less
prone
to
feel
the
misery
and
disgrace
of
succumbing
.
<EOS>
Who
has
been
through
a
large
school
and
does
not
remember
the
Maxwells
and
Grindleys
,
 
the
tyrants
and
the
slaves
,
 
those
who
domineered
and
those
who
submitted
?
<EOS>
Nor
was
it
,
even
then
,
personal
strength
,
nor
always
superior
courage
,
that
gave
the
power
of
command
.
<EOS>
Nor
was
it
intellect
,
or
thoughtfulness
,
nor
by
any
means
such
qualities
as
make
men
and
boys
lovable
.
<EOS>
It
is
said
by
many
who
have
had
to
deal
with
boys
,
that
certain
among
them
claim
and
obtain
ascendancy
by
the
spirit
within
them
;
but
I
doubt
whether
the
ascendancy
is
not
rather
thrust
on
them
than
claimed
by
them
.
<EOS>
Here
again
I
think
the
outward
gait
of
the
boy
goes
far
towards
obtaining
for
him
the
submission
of
his
fellows
.
  
<EOS>
But
the
tyrant
boy
does
not
become
the
tyrant
man
,
or
the
slave
boy
the
slave
man
,
because
the
outward
visage
,
that
has
been
noble
or
mean
in
the
one
,
changes
and
becomes
so
often
mean
or
noble
in
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
"
By
George
,
there
's
Pollock
!
<EOS>
"
said
Maxwell
,
as
he
rode
into
the
field
by
the
church
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
bet
half
a
crown
that
he
's
come
down
from
London
this
morning
,
that
he
was
up
all
night
last
night
,
and
that
he
tells
us
<EOS>
so
three
times
before
the
hounds
go
out
of
the
paddock
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Pollock
was
the
heavy
-
weight
sporting
literary
gentleman
.
   
<EOS>
Edgehill
.
 
<EOS>
Of
all
sights
in
the
world
there
is
,
I
think
,
none
more
beautiful
than
that
of
a
pack
of
fox
-
hounds
seated
,
on
a
winter
morning
,
round
the
huntsman
,
if
the
place
of
meeting
has
been
chosen
with
anything
of
artistic
skill
.
<EOS>
It
should
be
in
a
grassy
field
,
and
the
field
should
be
small
.
<EOS>
It
should
not
be
absolutely
away
from
all
buildings
,
and
the
hedgerows
should
not
have
been
clipped
and
pared
,
and
made
straight
with
reference
to
modern
agricultural
economy
.
<EOS>
There
should
be
trees
near
,
and
the
ground
should
be
a
little
uneven
,
so
as
to
mark
some
certain
small
space
as
the
exact
spot
where
the
dogs
and
servants
of
the
hunt
should
congregate
.
  
<EOS>
There
are
well
-
known
grand
meets
in
England
,
in
the
parks
of
noblemen
,
before
their
houses
,
or
even
on
what
are
called
their
lawns
;
but
these
magnificent
affairs
have
but
little
of
the
beauty
of
which
I
speak
.
<EOS>
Such
assemblies
are
too
grand
and
too
ornate
,
and
,
moreover
,
much
too
far
removed
from
true
sporting
proprieties
.
<EOS>
At
them
,
equipages
are
shining
,
and
ladies
"
dresses
are
gorgeous
,
and
crowds
of
tradesmen
from
the
neighbouring
town
have
come
there
to
look
at
the
grand
folk
.
<EOS>
To
my
eye
there
is
nothing
beautiful
in
that
.
<EOS>
The
meet
I
speak
of
is
arranged
with
a
view
to
sport
,
but
the
accident
of
the
locality
may
make
it
the
prettiest
thing
in
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
Such
,
in
a
special
degree
,
was
the
case
at
Edgehill
.
<EOS>
At
Edgehill
the
whole
village
consisted
of
three
or
four
cottages
;
but
there
was
a
small
old
church
,
with
an
old
grey
tower
,
and
a
narrow
,
green
,
almost
dark
,
churchyard
,
surrounded
by
elm
-
trees
.
<EOS>
The
road
from
Roebury
to
the
meet
passed
by
the
church
stile
,
and
turning
just
beyond
it
came
upon
the
gate
which
led
into
the
little
field
in
which
the
hounds
felt
themselves
as
much
at
home
as
in
their
kennels
.
<EOS>
There
might
be
six
or
seven
acres
in
the
field
,
which
was
long
and
narrow
,
so
that
the
huntsman
had
space
to
walk
leisurely
up
and
down
with
the
pack
clustering
round
him
,
when
he
considered
that
longer
sitting
might
chill
them
.
<EOS>
The
church
tower
was
close
at
hand
,
visible
through
the
trees
,
and
the
field
itself
was
green
and
soft
,
though
never
splashing
with
mud
or
heavy
with
holes
.
  
<EOS>
Edgehill
was
a
favourite
meet
in
that
country
,
partly
because
foxes
were
very
abundant
in
the
great
wood
adjacent
,
partly
because
the
whole
country
around
is
grass
-
land
,
and
partly
,
no
doubt
,
from
the
sporting
propensities
of
the
neighbouring
population
.
<EOS>
As
regards
my
own
taste
,
I
do
not
know
that
I
do
like
beginning
a
day
with
a
great
wood
,
 
and
if
not
beginning
it
,
certainly
not
ending
it
.
<EOS>
It
is
hard
to
come
upon
the
cream
of
hunting
,
as
it
is
upon
the
cream
of
any
other
delight
.
<EOS>
Who
can
always
drink
Lafitte
of
the
finest
,
can
always
talk
to
a
woman
who
is
both
beautiful
and
witty
,
or
can
always
find
the
right
spirit
in
the
poetry
he
reads
?
<EOS>
A
man
has
usually
to
work
through
much
mud
before
he
gets
his
nugget
.
<EOS>
It
is
so
certainly
in
hunting
,
and
a
big
wood
too
frequently
afflicts
the
sportsman
,
as
the
mud
does
the
miner
.
<EOS>
The
small
gorse
cover
is
the
happy
,
much
-
envied
bit
of
ground
in
which
the
gold
is
sure
to
show
itself
readily
.
<EOS>
But
without
the
woods
the
gorse
would
not
hold
the
foxes
,
and
without
the
mud
the
gold
would
not
have
found
its
resting
-
place
.
  
<EOS>
But
,
as
I
have
said
,
Edgehill
was
a
popular
meet
,
and
,
as
regarded
the
meet
itself
,
was
eminently
picturesque
.
<EOS>
On
the
present
occasion
the
little
field
was
full
of
horsemen
,
moving
about
slowly
,
chatting
together
,
smoking
cigars
,
getting
off
from
their
hacks
and
mounting
their
hunters
,
giving
orders
to
their
servants
,
and
preparing
for
the
day
.
<EOS>
There
were
old
country
gentlemen
there
,
greeting
each
other
from
far
sides
of
the
county
;
sporting
farmers
who
love
to
find
themselves
alongside
their
landlords
,
and
to
feel
that
the
pleasures
of
the
country
are
common
to
both
;
men
down
from
town
,
like
our
friends
of
the
Roebury
club
,
who
made
hunting
their
chosen
pleasure
,
and
who
formed
,
in
number
,
perhaps
the
largest
portion
of
the
field
;
officers
from
garrisons
round
about
;
a
cloud
of
servants
,
and
a
few
nondescript
stragglers
who
had
picked
up
horses
,
hither
and
thither
,
round
the
country
.
<EOS>
Outside
the
gate
on
the
road
were
drawn
up
a
variety
of
vehicles
,
open
carriages
,
dog
-
carts
,
gigs
,
and
waggonettes
,
in
some
few
of
which
were
seated
ladies
who
had
come
over
to
see
the
meet
.
<EOS>
But
Edgehill
was
,
essentially
,
not
a
ladies
'
meet
.
<EOS>
The
distances
to
it
were
long
,
and
the
rides
in
Cranby
Wood
 
<EOS>
the
big
wood
 
were
not
adapted
for
wheels
.
<EOS>
There
were
one
or
two
ladies
on
horseback
,
as
is
always
the
case
;
but
Edgehill
was
not
a
place
popular
,
even
with
hunting
ladies
.
<EOS>
One
carriage
,
that
of
the
old
master
of
the
hounds
,
had
entered
the
sacred
precincts
of
the
field
,
and
from
this
the
old
baronet
was
just
descending
,
as
Maxwell
,
Calder
Jones
,
and
Vavasor
rode
into
the
field
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
I
see
you
well
,
Sir
William
,
"
said
Maxwell
,
greeting
the
master
.
<EOS>
Calder
Jones
also
made
his
little
speech
,
and
so
did
Vavasor
.
  
<EOS>
"
Humph
 
<EOS>
well
,
yes
,
I
'm
pretty
well
,
thank'ee
.
<EOS>
Just
move
on
,
will
you
?
<EOS>
My
mare
ca
n't
stir
here
.
<EOS>
"
Then
some
one
else
spoke
to
him
,
and
he
only
grunted
in
answer
.
<EOS>
Having
slowly
been
assisted
up
on
to
his
horse
,
 
for
he
was
over
seventy
years
of
age
,
 
he
trotted
off
to
the
hounds
,
while
all
the
farmers
round
him
touched
their
hats
to
him
.
<EOS>
But
his
mind
was
laden
with
affairs
of
import
,
and
he
noticed
no
one
.
<EOS>
In
a
whispered
voice
he
gave
his
instructions
to
his
huntsman
,
who
said
,
"
Yes
,
Sir
William
,
"
"
No
,
Sir
William
,
"
"
No
doubt
,
Sir
William
.
<EOS>
"
One
long
-
eared
,
long
-
legged
fellow
,
in
a
hunting
-
cap
and
scarlet
coat
,
hung
listening
by
,
anxious
to
catch
something
of
the
orders
for
the
morning
.
<EOS>
"
Who
the
devil
's
that
fellow
,
that
's
all
breeches
and
boots
?
"
said
Sir
William
aloud
to
some
one
near
him
,
as
the
huntsman
moved
off
with
the
hounds
.
<EOS>
Sir
William
knew
the
man
well
enough
,
but
was
minded
to
punish
him
for
his
discourtesy
.
<EOS>
"
Where
shall
we
find
first
,
Sir
William
?
"
said
Calder
Jones
,
in
a
voice
that
was
really
very
humble
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
How
the
mischief
am
I
to
know
where
the
foxes
are
?
"
said
Sir
William
,
with
an
oath
;
and
Calder
Jones
retired
unhappy
,
and
for
the
moment
altogether
silenced
.
  
<EOS>
And
yet
Sir
William
was
the
most
popular
man
in
the
county
,
and
no
more
courteous
gentleman
ever
sat
at
the
bottom
of
his
own
table
.
<EOS>
A
mild
man
he
was
,
too
,
when
out
of
his
saddle
,
and
<EOS>
one
by
no
means
disposed
to
assume
special
supremacy
.
<EOS>
But
a
master
of
hounds
,
if
he
have
long
held
the
country
,
 
and
Sir
William
had
held
his
for
more
than
thirty
years
,
 
obtains
a
power
which
that
of
no
other
potentate
can
equal
.
<EOS>
He
may
say
and
do
what
he
pleases
,
and
his
tyranny
is
always
respected
.
<EOS>
No
conspiracy
against
him
has
a
chance
of
success
;
no
sedition
will
meet
with
sympathy
;
 
that
is
,
if
he
be
successful
in
showing
sport
.
<EOS>
If
a
man
be
sworn
at
,
abused
,
and
put
down
without
cause
,
let
him
bear
it
and
think
that
he
has
been
a
victim
for
the
public
good
.
<EOS>
And
let
him
never
be
angry
with
the
master
.
<EOS>
That
rough
tongue
is
the
necessity
of
the
master
's
position
.
<EOS>
They
used
to
say
that
no
captain
could
manage
a
ship
without
swearing
at
his
men
.
<EOS>
But
what
are
the
captain
's
troubles
in
comparison
with
those
of
the
master
of
hounds
?
<EOS>
The
captain
's
men
are
under
discipline
,
and
can
be
locked
up
,
flogged
,
or
have
their
grog
stopped
.
<EOS>
The
master
of
hounds
can
not
stop
the
grog
of
any
offender
,
and
he
can
only
stop
the
tongue
,
or
horse
,
of
such
an
one
by
very
sharp
words
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Pollock
,
when
did
you
come
?
"
said
Maxwell
.
  
<EOS>
"
By
George
,
"
said
the
literary
gentleman
,
"
just
down
from
London
by
the
8.30
from
Euston
Square
,
and
got
over
here
from
Winslow
in
a
trap
,
with
two
fellows
I
never
saw
in
my
life
before
.
<EOS>
We
came
tandem
in
a
fly
,
and
did
the
nineteen
miles
in
an
hour
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Come
,
Athenian
,
draw
it
mild
,
"
said
Maxwell
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
did
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
whether
they
'll
pay
me
their
share
of
the
fly
.
<EOS>
I
had
to
leave
Onslow
Crescent
at
a
quarter
before
eight
,
and
I
did
three
hours
<EOS>
"
work
before
I
started
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
you
did
it
by
candle
-
light
,
"
said
Grindley
.
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
I
did
;
and
why
should
n't
I
?
<EOS>
Do
you
suppose
no
one
can
work
by
candle
-
light
except
a
lawyer
?
<EOS>
I
suppose
you
fellows
were
playing
whist
,
and
drinking
hard
.
<EOS>
I
'm
uncommon
glad
<EOS>
I
was
n't
with
you
,
for
I
shall
be
able
to
ride
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
bet
you
a
pound
,
"
said
Jones
,
"
<EOS>
if
there
's
a
run
,
I
see
more
of
it
than
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
take
that
bet
with
Jones
,
"
said
Grindley
,
"
and
Vavasor
shall
be
the
judge
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Gentlemen
,
the
hounds
ca
n't
get
out
,
if
you
will
stop
up
the
gate
,
"
said
Sir
William
.
<EOS>
Then
the
pack
passed
through
,
and
they
all
trotted
on
for
four
miles
,
to
Cranby
Wood
.
  
<EOS>
Vavasor
,
as
he
rode
on
to
the
wood
,
was
alone
,
or
speaking
,
from
time
to
time
,
a
few
words
to
his
servant
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
ride
the
chestnut
mare
in
the
wood
,
"
he
said
,
"
and
do
you
keep
near
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
bean't
to
be
galloping
up
and
down
them
rides
<EOS>
,
I
suppose
,
"
said
Bat
,
almost
contemptuously
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
sha
n't
gallop
up
and
down
the
rides
,
myself
;
but
do
you
mark
me
,
to
know
where
I
am
,
so
that
I
can
change
if
a
fox
should
go
away
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
'll
be
here
all
day
,
sir
.
<EOS>
That
's
my
belief
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
so
,
I
wo
n't
ride
the
brown
horse
at
all
.
<EOS>
But
do
you
take
care
to
let
me
have
him
if
there
's
a
chance
.
<EOS>
Do
you
understand
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
yes
,
I
understand
,
sir
.
<EOS>
There
ai
n't
no
difficulty
in
my
understanding
;
 
only
I
do
n't
think
,
<EOS>
sir
,
you
'll
ever
get
a
fox
out
of
that
wood
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
Why
,
it
stands
to
reason
.
<EOS>
The
wind
's
from
the
north
-
east
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Cranby
Wood
is
very
large
,
 
there
being
,
in
truth
,
two
or
three
woods
together
.
<EOS>
It
was
nearly
twelve
before
they
found
;
and
then
for
an
hour
there
was
great
excitement
among
the
men
,
who
rode
up
and
down
the
rides
as
the
hounds
drove
the
fox
from
one
end
to
another
of
the
enclosure
.
<EOS>
Once
or
twice
the
poor
animal
did
try
to
go
away
,
and
then
there
was
great
hallooing
,
galloping
,
and
jumping
over
unnecessary
fences
;
but
he
was
headed
back
again
,
or
changed
his
mind
,
not
liking
the
north
-
east
wind
of
which
Bat
Smithers
had
predicted
such
bad
things
.
<EOS>
After
one
the
crowd
of
men
became
rather
more
indifferent
,
and
clustered
together
in
broad
spots
,
eating
their
lunch
,
smoking
cigars
,
and
chaffing
each
other
.
<EOS>
It
was
singular
to
observe
the
amazing
quantity
of
ham
sandwiches
and
of
sherry
that
had
been
carried
into
Cranby
Wood
on
that
day
.
<EOS>
Grooms
appeared
to
have
been
laden
with
cases
,
and
men
were
as
well
armed
with
flasks
at
their
saddle
-
bows
as
they
used
to
be
with
pistols
.
<EOS>
Maxwell
and
Pollock
formed
the
centre
of
one
of
these
crowds
,
and
chaffed
each
other
with
the
utmost
industry
,
till
,
tired
of
having
inflicted
no
wounds
,
they
turned
upon
Grindley
and
drove
him
out
of
the
circle
.
<EOS>
"
You
'll
make
that
man
cut
his
throat
,
if
you
go
on
at
that
,
"
said
Pollock
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Shall
I
?
"
said
Maxwell
.
<EOS>
"
Then
I
'll
certainly
stick
to
him
for
the
sake
of
humanity
in
general
.
<EOS>
"
During
all
this
time
Vavasor
sat
apart
,
quite
alone
,
and
Bat
Smithers
grimly
kept
his
place
,
about
three
hundred
yards
from
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
sha
n't
do
any
good
to
-
day
,
"
said
Grindley
,
coming
up
to
Vavasor
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
sure
I
do
n't
know
,
"
said
Vavasor
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
old
fellow
has
got
to
be
so
stupid
,
he
does
n't
know
what
he
's
about
,
"
said
Grindley
,
meaning
Sir
William
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
can
he
make
the
fox
break
?
"
said
Vavasor
;
and
as
his
voice
was
by
no
means
encouraging
Grindley
rode
away
.
  
<EOS>
Lunch
and
cigars
lasted
till
two
,
during
which
hour
the
hounds
,
<EOS>
the
huntsmen
,
the
whips
,
and
old
Sir
William
were
hard
at
work
,
as
also
were
some
few
others
who
persistently
followed
every
chance
of
the
game
.
<EOS>
From
that
till
three
there
were
two
or
three
flashes
in
the
pan
,
and
false
reports
as
to
foxes
which
had
gone
away
,
which
first
set
men
galloping
,
and
then
made
them
very
angry
.
<EOS>
After
three
,
men
began
to
say
naughty
things
,
to
abuse
Cranby
Wood
,
to
wish
violently
that
they
had
remained
at
home
or
gone
elsewhere
,
and
to
speak
irreverently
of
their
ancient
master
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
the
cussidest
place
in
all
creation
,
"
said
Maxwell
.
<EOS>
"
I
often
said
I
'd
not
come
here
any
more
,
and
now
I
say
it
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
yet
you
'll
be
here
the
next
meet
,
"
said
Grindley
,
who
had
sneaked
back
to
his
old
companions
in
weariness
of
spirit
.
  
<EOS>
"
Grindems
,
you
know
a
sight
too
much
,
"
said
Maxwell
;
"
you
do
indeed
.
<EOS>
An
ordinary
fellow
has
no
chance
with
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Grindley
was
again
going
to
catch
it
,
but
was
on
this
time
saved
by
the
appearance
of
the
huntsman
,
who
came
galloping
up
one
of
the
rides
,
with
a
lot
of
the
hounds
at
his
heels
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
n't
away
,
Tom
,
surely
?
"
said
Maxwell
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
's
out
of
the
wood
somewheres
,
"
said
Tom
;
 
and
off
they
all
went
.
<EOS>
Vavasor
changed
his
horse
,
getting
on
to
the
brown
one
,
and
giving
up
his
chestnut
mare
to
Bat
Smithers
,
who
suggested
that
he
might
as
well
go
home
to
Roebury
now
.
<EOS>
Vavasor
gave
him
no
answer
,
but
,
trotting
on
to
the
point
where
the
rides
met
,
stopped
a
moment
and
listened
carefully
.
<EOS>
Then
he
took
a
path
diverging
away
from
that
by
which
the
huntsmen
and
the
crowd
of
horsemen
had
gone
,
and
made
the
best
of
his
way
through
the
wood
.
<EOS>
At
the
end
of
this
he
came
upon
Sir
William
,
who
,
with
no
one
near
him
but
his
servant
,
was
standing
in
the
pathway
of
a
little
hunting
-
gate
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hold
hard
,
"
said
Sir
William
.
<EOS>
"
The
hounds
are
not
out
of
the
wood
yet
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Is
the
fox
away
,
sir
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
good
of
that
if
we
ca
n't
get
the
hounds
out
?
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
he
's
away
.
<EOS>
He
passed
out
where
I
'm
standing
.
"
<EOS>
And
then
he
began
to
blow
his
horn
lustily
,
and
by
degrees
other
men
and
a
few
hounds
came
down
the
ride
.
<EOS>
Then
Tom
,
with
his
horse
almost
blown
,
made
his
appearance
outside
the
wood
,
and
soon
there
came
a
rush
of
men
,
nearly
on
the
top
of
one
another
,
pushing
on
,
not
knowing
whither
,
but
keenly
alive
to
the
fact
that
the
fox
had
at
last
consented
to
move
his
quarters
.
  
<EOS>
Tom
touched
his
hat
,
and
looked
at
his
master
,
inquiringly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
's
gone
for
Claydon
's
,
"
said
the
master
.
<EOS>
"
Try
them
up
that
hedgerow
.
<EOS>
"
Tom
did
try
them
up
the
hedgerow
,
and
in
half
a
minute
the
hounds
came
upon
the
scent
.
<EOS>
Then
you
might
see
men
settling
their
hats
on
their
heads
,
and
feeling
their
feet
in
the
stirrups
.
<EOS>
The
moment
for
which
they
had
so
long
waited
had
come
,
and
yet
there
were
many
who
would
now
have
preferred
that
the
fox
should
be
headed
back
into
cover
.
<EOS>
Some
had
but
<EOS>
little
confidence
in
their
half
-
blown
horses
;
 
with
many
the
waiting
,
though
so
abused
and
anathematized
,
was
in
truth
more
to
their
taste
than
the
run
itself
;
 
with
others
the
excitement
had
gone
by
,
and
a
gallop
over
a
field
or
two
was
necessary
before
it
would
be
restored
.
<EOS>
With
most
men
at
such
a
moment
there
is
a
little
nervousness
,
some
fear
of
making
a
bad
start
,
a
dread
lest
others
should
have
more
of
the
success
of
the
hunt
than
falls
to
them
.
<EOS>
But
there
was
a
great
rush
and
a
mighty
bustle
as
the
hounds
made
out
their
game
,
and
Sir
William
felt
himself
called
upon
to
use
the
rough
side
of
his
tongue
to
more
than
one
delinquent
.
  
<EOS>
And
then
certain
sly
old
stagers
might
be
seen
turning
off
to
the
left
,
instead
of
following
the
course
of
the
game
as
indicated
by
the
hounds
.
<EOS>
They
were
men
who
had
felt
the
air
as
they
came
out
,
and
knew
that
the
fox
must
soon
run
down
wind
,
whatever
he
might
do
for
the
first
half
mile
or
so
,
 
men
who
knew
also
which
was
the
shortest
way
to
Claydon
's
by
the
road
.
<EOS>
Ah
,
the
satisfaction
that
there
is
when
these
men
are
thrown
out
,
and
their
dead
knowledge
proved
to
be
of
no
avail
!
<EOS>
If
a
fox
will
only
run
straight
,
heading
from
the
cover
on
his
real
line
,
these
very
sagacious
gentlemen
seldom
come
to
much
honour
and
glory
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
present
instance
the
beast
seemed
determined
to
go
straight
enough
,
for
the
hounds
ran
the
scent
along
three
or
four
hedgerows
in
a
line
.
<EOS>
He
had
managed
to
get
for
himself
full
ten
minutes
"
start
,
and
had
been
able
to
leave
the
cover
and
all
his
enemies
well
behind
him
before
he
bethought
himself
as
to
his
best
way
to
his
purposed
destination
.
<EOS>
And
here
,
from
field
to
field
,
there
were
little
hunting
-
gates
at
which
men
crowded
lustily
,
poking
and
shoving
each
other
's
horses
,
and
hating
each
other
with
a
bitterness
of
hatred
which
is
,
I
think
,
known
nowhere
else
.
<EOS>
No
hunting
man
ever
wants
to
jump
if
he
can
help
it
,
and
the
hedges
near
the
gate
were
not
alluring
.
<EOS>
A
few
there
were
who
made
lines
for
themselves
,
taking
the
next
field
to
the
right
,
or
scrambling
through
the
corners
of
the
fences
while
the
rush
was
going
on
at
the
gates
;
and
among
these
was
George
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
He
never
rode
in
a
crowd
,
always
keeping
himself
somewhat
away
from
men
as
well
as
hounds
.
<EOS>
He
would
often
be
thrown
out
,
and
then
men
would
hear
no
more
of
him
for
that
day
.
<EOS>
On
such
occasions
he
did
not
show
himself
,
as
other
men
do
,
twenty
minutes
after
the
fox
had
been
killed
or
run
to
ground
,
 
but
betook
himself
home
by
himself
,
going
through
the
byeways
and
lanes
,
thus
leaving
no
report
of
his
failure
to
be
spoken
of
by
his
compeers
.
  
<EOS>
As
long
as
the
line
of
gates
lasted
,
the
crowd
continued
as
thick
as
ever
,
and
the
best
man
was
he
whose
horse
could
shove
the
hardest
.
<EOS>
After
passing
some
four
or
five
fields
in
this
way
they
came
out
upon
a
road
,
and
,
the
scent
holding
strong
,
the
dogs
crossed
it
without
any
demurring
.
<EOS>
Then
came
doubt
into
the
minds
of
men
,
many
of
whom
,
before
they
would
venture
away
from
their
position
on
the
lane
,
narrowly
watched
the
leading
hounds
to
see
whether
there
was
indication
of
a
turn
to
the
one
side
or
the
other
.
<EOS>
Sir
William
,
whose
seventy
odd
years
excused
him
,
turned
sharp
to
the
left
,
knowing
that
he
could
make
Claydon
's
that
way
;
and
very
many
were
the
submissive
horsemen
who
followed
him
;
a
few
took
the
road
to
the
right
,
having
in
their
minds
some
little
game
of
their
own
.
<EOS>
The
hardest
riders
there
had
already
crossed
from
the
road
into
the
country
,
and
were
going
well
to
the
hounds
,
ignorant
,
some
of
them
,
of
the
brook
before
them
,
and
others
unheeding
.
<EOS>
Foremost
among
these
was
Burgo
Fitzgerald
,
 
Burgo
Fitzgerald
,
whom
no
man
had
ever
known
to
crane
at
a
fence
,
or
to
hug
a
road
,
or
to
spare
his
own
neck
or
his
horse
's
.
<EOS>
And
yet
poor
Burgo
seldom
finished
well
,
 
coming
to
repeated
grief
in
this
matter
of
his
hunting
,
as
he
did
so
constantly
in
other
matters
of
his
life
.
  
<EOS>
But
almost
neck
and
neck
with
Burgo
was
Pollock
,
the
sporting
literary
gentleman
.
<EOS>
Pollock
had
but
two
horses
to
his
stud
,
and
was
never
known
to
give
much
money
for
them
;
 
and
he
weighed
without
his
boots
,
fifteen
stones
!
<EOS>
No
one
ever
knew
how
Pollock
did
it
;
 
more
especially
as
all
the
world
declared
that
he
was
as
ignorant
of
hunting
as
any
tailor
.
<EOS>
He
could
ride
,
or
when
he
could
n't
ride
he
could
tumble
,
 
men
said
that
of
him
,
 
and
he
would
ride
as
long
as
the
beast
under
him
could
go
.
<EOS>
But
few
knew
the
sad
misfortunes
which
poor
Pollock
sometimes
encountered
;
 
the
muddy
ditches
in
which
he
was
left
;
the
despair
with
which
he
would
stand
by
his
unfortunate
horse
when
the
poor
brute
could
no
longer
move
across
some
deep
-
ploughed
field
;
the
miles
that
he
would
walk
at
night
beside
a
tired
animal
,
as
he
made
his
way
slowly
back
to
Roebury
!
  
<EOS>
Then
came
Tom
the
huntsman
,
with
Calder
Jones
close
to
him
,
and
Grindley
intent
on
winning
his
sovereign
.
<EOS>
Vavasor
had
also
crossed
the
road
somewhat
to
the
left
,
carrying
with
him
one
or
two
who
knew
that
he
was
a
safe
man
to
follow
.
<EOS>
Maxwell
had
been
ignominiously
turned
by
the
hedge
,
which
,
together
with
its
ditch
,
formed
a
fence
such
as
all
men
do
not
love
at
the
beginning
of
a
run
.
<EOS>
He
had
turned
from
it
,
acknowledging
the
cause
.
<EOS>
"
By
George
!
"
said
he
,
"
that
's
too
big
for
me
yet
awhile
;
and
there
's
no
end
of
a
river
at
the
bottom
.
<EOS>
"
So
he
had
followed
the
master
down
the
road
.
  
<EOS>
All
those
whom
we
have
named
managed
to
get
over
the
brook
,
Pollock
's
horse
barely
contriving
to
get
up
his
hind
legs
from
the
broken
edge
of
the
bank
.
<EOS>
Some
nags
refused
it
,
and
their
riders
thus
lost
all
their
chance
of
sport
for
that
day
.
<EOS>
Such
is
the
lot
of
men
who
hunt
.
<EOS>
A
man
pays
five
or
six
pounds
for
his
day
's
amusement
,
and
it
is
ten
to
one
that
the
occurrences
of
the
day
disgust
rather
than
gratify
him
!
<EOS>
One
or
two
got
in
,
and
scrambled
out
on
the
other
side
,
but
Tufto
Pearlings
,
the
Manchester
man
from
Friday
Street
,
stuck
in
the
mud
at
the
bottom
,
and
could
not
get
his
mare
out
till
seven
men
had
come
with
ropes
to
help
him
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Where
the
devil
is
my
fellow
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Pearlings
asked
of
the
countrymen
;
but
the
countrymen
could
not
tell
him
that
"
his
fellow
"
with
his
second
horse
was
riding
the
hunt
with
great
satisfaction
to
himself
.
  
<EOS>
George
Vavasor
found
that
his
horse
went
with
him
uncommonly
well
,
taking
his
fences
almost
in
the
stride
of
his
gallop
,
and
giving
unmistakeable
signs
of
good
condition
.
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
what
it
is
that
's
amiss
with
him
,
"
said
George
to
himself
,
resolving
,
however
,
that
he
would
sell
him
that
day
if
he
got
an
opportunity
.
<EOS>
Straight
went
the
line
of
the
fox
,
up
from
the
brook
,
and
Tom
began
to
say
that
his
master
had
been
wrong
about
Claydon
's
.
  
<EOS>
"
Where
are
we
now
?
"
said
Burgo
,
as
four
or
five
of
them
dashed
through
the
open
gate
of
a
farmyard
.
  
<EOS>
"
This
is
Bulby
's
farm
,
"
said
Tom
,
"
and
we
're
going
right
away
for
Elmham
Wood
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Elmham
Wood
be
d
 
---
,
"
said
a
stout
farmer
,
who
had
come
as
far
as
that
with
them
.
<EOS>
"
You
wo
n't
see
Elmham
Wood
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
you
know
best
,
"
said
Tom
;
and
then
they
were
through
the
yard
,
across
another
road
,
and
down
a
steep
ravine
by
the
side
of
a
little
copse
.
<EOS>
"
He
's
been
through
them
firs
,
any
way
,
"
said
Tom
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
To
him
,
Gaylass
!
"
<EOS>
Then
up
they
went
the
other
side
of
the
ravine
,
and
saw
the
body
of
the
hounds
almost
a
field
before
them
at
the
top
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
 
that
took
some
of
the
wind
out
of
a
fellow
,
"
said
Pollock
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
n't
mind
about
wind
now
,
"
said
Burgo
,
dashing
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
Was
n't
the
pace
awful
,
coming
up
to
that
farmhouse
?
"
said
Calder
Jones
,
looking
round
to
see
if
Grindley
was
shaken
off
.
<EOS>
But
Grindley
,
with
some
six
or
seven
others
,
was
still
there
.
<EOS>
And
there
,
also
,
always
in
the
next
field
to
the
left
,
was
George
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
He
had
spoken
no
word
to
any
one
since
the
hunt
commenced
,
nor
had
he
wished
to
speak
to
any
one
.
<EOS>
He
desired
to
sell
his
horse
,
 
and
he
desired
also
to
succeed
in
the
run
for
other
reasons
than
that
,
though
I
think
he
would
have
found
it
difficult
to
define
them
.
  
<EOS>
Now
they
had
open
grass
land
for
about
a
mile
,
but
with
very
heavy
fences
,
 
so
that
the
hounds
gained
upon
them
a
little
,
and
Pollock
's
weight
began
to
tell
.
<EOS>
The
huntsman
and
Burgo
were
leading
with
some
fortunate
county
gentleman
whose
good
stars
had
brought
him
in
upon
them
at
the
farmyard
gate
.
<EOS>
It
is
the
injustice
of
such
accidents
as
this
that
breaks
the
heart
of
a
man
who
has
honestly
gone
through
all
the
heat
and
work
of
the
struggle
!
<EOS>
And
the
hounds
had
veered
a
little
round
to
the
left
,
making
,
after
all
,
for
Claydon
's
.
<EOS>
"
Darned
if
the
Squire
warn't
<EOS>
right
,
"
said
Tom
.
<EOS>
Sir
William
,
though
a
baronet
,
was
familiarly
called
the
Squire
throughout
the
hunt
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
ai
n't
going
for
Claydon
's
now
?
"
asked
Burgo
.
  
<EOS>
"
Them
's
Claydon
's
beeches
we
sees
over
there
,
"
said
Tom
.
"
<EOS>
"
Tain't
often
the
Squire
's
wrong
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Here
they
came
to
a
little
double
rail
and
a
little
quick
-
set
hedge
.
<EOS>
A
double
rail
is
a
nasty
fence
always
if
it
has
been
made
any
way
strong
,
and
one
which
a
man
with
a
wife
and
a
family
is
justified
in
avoiding
.
<EOS>
They
mostly
can
be
avoided
,
having
gates
;
and
this
could
have
been
avoided
.
<EOS>
But
Burgo
never
avoided
anything
,
and
went
over
it
beautifully
.
<EOS>
The
difficulty
is
to
be
discreet
when
the
man
before
one
has
been
indiscreet
.
<EOS>
Tom
went
for
the
gate
,
as
did
Pollock
,
who
knew
that
he
could
have
no
chance
at
the
double
rails
.
<EOS>
But
Calder
Jones
came
to
infinite
grief
,
striking
the
top
bar
of
the
second
rail
,
and
going
head
-
foremost
out
of
his
saddle
,
as
though
thrown
by
a
catapult
.
<EOS>
There
we
must
leave
him
.
<EOS>
Grindley
,
rejoicing
greatly
at
this
discomfiture
,
made
for
the
gate
;
but
the
country
gentleman
with
the
fresh
horse
accomplished
the
rails
,
and
was
soon
alongside
of
Burgo
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
see
you
at
the
start
,
"
said
Burgo
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
did
n't
see
you
,
"
said
the
country
gentleman
;
"
so
it
's
even
.
"
  
<EOS>
Burgo
did
not
see
the
thing
in
the
same
light
,
but
he
said
no
more
.
<EOS>
Grindley
and
Tom
were
soon
after
them
,
Tom
doing
his
utmost
to
shake
off
the
attorney
.
<EOS>
Pollock
was
coming
on
also
;
but
the
pace
had
been
too
much
for
him
,
and
though
the
ground
rode
light
his
poor
beast
laboured
and
grunted
sorely
.
<EOS>
The
hounds
were
still
veering
somewhat
to
the
left
,
and
Burgo
,
jumping
over
a
small
fence
into
the
same
field
with
them
,
saw
that
there
was
a
horseman
ahead
of
him
.
<EOS>
This
was
George
Vavasor
,
who
was
going
well
,
without
any
symptom
of
distress
.
  
<EOS>
And
now
they
were
at
Claydon
's
,
having
run
over
some
seven
miles
of
ground
in
about
thirty
-
five
minutes
.
<EOS>
To
those
who
do
not
know
what
hunting
is
,
this
pace
does
not
seem
very
extraordinary
;
but
it
had
been
quite
quick
enough
,
as
was
testified
by
the
horses
which
had
gone
the
distance
.
<EOS>
Our
party
entered
Claydon
's
Park
at
back
,
through
a
gate
in
the
park
palings
that
was
open
on
hunting
days
;
but
a
much
more
numerous
lot
was
there
almost
as
soon
as
them
,
who
had
come
in
by
the
main
entrance
.
<EOS>
This
lot
was
headed
by
Sir
William
,
and
our
friend
Maxwell
was
with
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
jolly
thing
so
far
,
"
said
Burgo
to
Maxwell
;
"
about
the
best
we
've
had
this
year
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
see
a
yard
of
it
,
"
said
Maxwell
.
<EOS>
"
I
had
n't
nerve
to
get
off
the
first
road
,
and
I
have
n't
been
off
it
ever
since
.
<EOS>
"
Maxwell
was
a
man
who
never
lied
about
his
hunting
,
or
had
the
slightest
shame
in
riding
roads
.
<EOS>
"
Who
's
been
with
you
?
"
said
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
've
been
Tom
and
I
;
 
and
Calder
Jones
was
there
for
a
while
.
<EOS>
I
think
he
killed
himself
somewhere
.
<EOS>
And
there
was
Pollock
,
and
your
friend
Grindley
,
and
a
chap
whose
name
I
do
n't
know
who
dropped
out
of
heaven
about
half
-
way
in
the
run
;
and
there
was
another
man
whose
back
I
saw
just
now
;
there
he
is
,
 
by
heavens
,
it
's
Vavasor
!
<EOS>
I
did
n't
know
he
was
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
They
hung
about
the
Claydon
covers
for
ten
minutes
,
and
then
their
fox
went
off
again
,
 
their
fox
or
another
,
as
to
which
there
was
a
great
discussion
afterwards
;
but
he
who
would
have
suggested
the
idea
of
a
new
fox
to
Sir
William
would
have
been
a
bold
man
.
<EOS>
A
fox
,
however
,
went
off
,
turning
still
to
the
left
from
Claydon
's
towards
Roebury
.
<EOS>
Those
ten
minutes
had
brought
up
some
fifty
men
;
but
it
did
not
bring
up
Calder
Jones
nor
Tufto
Pearlings
,
nor
some
half
-
dozen
others
who
had
already
come
to
serious
misfortune
;
but
Grindley
was
there
,
very
triumphant
in
his
own
success
,
and
already
talking
of
Jones
's
sovereign
.
<EOS>
And
Pollock
was
there
also
,
thankful
for
the
ten
minutes
"
law
,
and
trusting
that
wind
might
be
given
to
his
horse
to
finish
the
run
triumphantly
.
  
<EOS>
But
the
pace
on
leaving
Claydon
's
was
better
than
ever
.
<EOS>
This
may
have
come
from
the
fact
that
the
scent
was
keener
,
as
they
got
out
so
close
upon
their
game
.
<EOS>
But
I
think
they
must
have
changed
their
fox
.
<EOS>
Maxwell
,
who
saw
him
go
,
swore
that
he
was
fresh
and
clean
.
<EOS>
Burgo
said
that
he
knew
it
to
be
the
same
fox
,
but
gave
no
reason
.
"
<EOS>
Same
fox
!
<EOS>
in
course
it
was
;
why
should
n't
it
be
the
same
?
"
said
Tom
.
<EOS>
The
country
gentleman
who
had
dropped
from
heaven
was
quite
sure
that
they
had
changed
,
and
so
were
most
of
those
who
had
ridden
the
road
.
<EOS>
Pollock
confined
himself
to
hoping
that
he
might
soon
be
killed
,
and
that
thus
his
triumph
for
the
day
might
be
assured
.
  
<EOS>
On
they
went
,
and
the
pace
soon
became
too
good
for
the
poor
author
.
<EOS>
His
horse
at
last
refused
a
little
hedge
,
and
there
was
not
another
trot
to
be
got
out
of
him
.
<EOS>
That
night
Pollock
turned
up
at
Roebury
about
nine
o'clock
,
very
hungry
,
 
and
it
was
known
that
his
animal
was
alive
;
 
but
the
poor
horse
ate
not
a
grain
of
oats
that
night
,
nor
on
the
next
morning
.
<EOS>
Vavasor
had
again
taken
a
line
to
himself
,
on
this
occasion
a
little
to
the
right
of
the
meet
;
but
Maxwell
followed
him
and
rode
close
with
him
to
the
end
.
<EOS>
Burgo
for
a
while
still
led
the
body
of
the
field
,
incurring
at
first
much
condemnation
from
Sir
William
,
 
nominally
for
hurrying
on
among
the
hounds
,
but
in
truth
because
he
got
before
Sir
William
himself
.
<EOS>
During
this
latter
part
of
the
run
Sir
William
stuck
to
the
hounds
in
spite
of
his
seventy
odd
years
.
<EOS>
Going
down
into
Marham
Bottom
,
some
four
or
five
were
left
behind
,
for
they
feared
the
soft
ground
near
the
river
,
and
did
not
know
the
pass
through
it
.
<EOS>
But
Sir
William
knew
it
,
and
those
who
remained
close
to
him
got
over
that
trouble
.
<EOS>
Burgo
,
who
would
still
lead
,
nearly
foundered
in
the
bog
;
 
but
he
was
light
,
and
his
horse
pulled
him
through
,
 
leaving
a
fore
-
shoe
in
the
mud
.
<EOS>
After
that
Burgo
was
contented
to
give
Sir
William
the
lead
.
  
<EOS>
Then
they
came
up
by
Marham
Pits
to
Cleshey
Small
Wood
,
which
they
passed
without
hanging
there
a
minute
,
and
over
the
grass
lands
of
Cleshey
Farm
.
<EOS>
Here
Vavasor
and
Maxwell
joined
the
others
,
having
gained
some
three
hundred
yards
in
distance
by
their
course
,
but
having
been
forced
to
jump
the
Marham
Stream
which
Sir
William
had
forded
.
<EOS>
The
pace
now
was
as
good
as
the
horses
could
make
it
,
 
and
perhaps
something
better
as
regarded
some
of
them
.
<EOS>
Sir
William
's
servant
had
been
with
him
,
and
he
had
got
his
second
horse
at
Claydon
's
;
Maxwell
had
been
equally
fortunate
;
Tom
's
second
horse
had
not
come
up
,
and
his
beast
was
in
great
distress
;
Grindley
had
remained
behind
at
Marham
Bottom
,
being
contented
perhaps
with
having
beaten
Calder
Jones
,
 
from
whom
by
-
the
-
by
I
may
here
declare
that
he
never
got
his
sovereign
.
<EOS>
Burgo
,
Vavasor
,
and
the
country
gentleman
still
held
on
;
but
it
was
devoutly
desired
by
all
of
them
that
the
fox
might
soon
come
to
the
end
of
his
tether
.
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
that
intense
longing
that
the
fox
may
fail
,
when
the
failings
of
the
horse
begin
to
make
themselves
known
,
 
and
<EOS>
the
consciousness
comes
on
that
all
that
one
has
done
will
go
for
nothing
unless
the
thing
can
be
brought
to
a
close
in
a
field
or
two
!
<EOS>
So
far
you
have
triumphed
,
leaving
scores
of
men
behind
;
but
of
what
good
is
all
that
,
if
you
also
are
to
be
left
behind
at
the
last
?
  
<EOS>
It
was
manifest
now
to
all
who
knew
the
country
that
the
fox
was
making
for
Thornden
Deer
Park
,
but
Thornden
Deer
Park
was
still
two
miles
ahead
of
them
,
and
the
hounds
were
so
near
to
their
game
that
the
poor
beast
could
hardly
hope
to
live
till
he
got
there
.
<EOS>
He
had
tried
a
well
-
known
drain
near
Cleshey
Farm
House
;
but
it
had
been
inhospitably
,
nay
cruelly
,
closed
against
him
.
<EOS>
Soon
after
that
he
threw
himself
down
in
a
ditch
,
and
the
eager
hounds
overran
him
,
giving
him
a
moment
's
law
,
 
and
giving
also
a
moment
's
law
to
horses
that
wanted
it
as
badly
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
about
done
for
,
"
said
Burgo
to
Maxwell
.
"
<EOS>
Luckily
for
you
,
"
said
Maxwell
,
"
the
fox
is
much
in
the
same
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
But
the
fox
had
still
more
power
left
in
him
than
poor
Burgo
Fitzgerald
's
horse
.
<EOS>
He
gained
a
minute
's
check
and
then
he
started
again
,
being
viewed
away
by
Sir
William
himself
.
<EOS>
The
country
gentleman
of
whom
mention
has
been
made
also
viewed
him
,
and
holloa'd
as
he
did
so
:
"
Yoicks
,
tally
;
gone
away
!
"
<EOS>
The
unfortunate
man
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
the
d
 
---
are
you
roaring
at
?
"
said
Sir
William
.
<EOS>
"
Do
you
suppose
I
do
n't
know
where
the
fox
is
?
"
<EOS>
Whereupon
the
country
gentleman
retreated
,
and
became
less
conspicuous
than
he
had
been
.
  
<EOS>
Away
they
went
again
,
off
Cleshey
and
into
Thornden
parish
,
on
the
land
of
Sorrel
Farm
,
 
a
spot
well
to
be
remembered
by
one
or
two
ever
afterwards
.
<EOS>
Here
Sir
William
made
for
a
gate
which
took
him
a
little
out
of
the
line
,
but
Maxwell
and
Burgo
Fitzgerald
,
followed
by
Vavasor
,
went
straight
ahead
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
huge
ditch
and
boundary
bank
there
which
Sir
William
had
known
and
had
avoided
.
<EOS>
Maxwell
,
whose
pluck
had
returned
to
him
at
last
,
took
it
well
.
<EOS>
His
horse
was
comparatively
fresh
and
made
nothing
of
it
.
<EOS>
Then
came
poor
Burgo
!
<EOS>
Oh
,
Burgo
,
hadst
thou
not
have
been
a
very
child
,
thou
shouldst
have
known
that
now
,
at
this
time
of
the
day
,
 
after
all
that
thy
gallant
horse
had
done
for
thee
,
 
it
was
impossible
to
thee
or
him
.
<EOS>
But
when
did
Burgo
Fitzgerald
know
anything
?
<EOS>
He
rode
at
the
bank
as
though
it
had
been
the
first
fence
of
the
day
,
striking
his
poor
beast
with
his
spurs
,
as
though
muscle
,
strength
,
and
new
power
could
be
imparted
by
their
rowels
.
<EOS>
The
animal
rose
at
the
bank
and
in
some
way
got
upon
it
,
scrambling
as
he
struck
it
with
his
chest
,
and
then
fell
headlong
into
the
ditch
at
the
other
side
,
a
confused
mass
of
head
,
limbs
,
and
body
.
<EOS>
His
career
was
at
an
end
,
and
he
had
broken
his
heart
!
<EOS>
Poor
noble
beast
,
noble
in
vain
!
<EOS>
To
his
very
last
gasp
he
had
done
his
best
,
and
had
deserved
that
he
should
have
been
in
better
hands
.
<EOS>
His
master
's
ignorance
had
killed
him
.
<EOS>
There
are
men
who
never
know
how
little
a
horse
can
do
,
 
or
how
much
!
  
<EOS>
There
was
to
some
extent
a
gap
in
the
fence
when
Maxwell
had
first
ridden
it
and
Burgo
had
followed
him
;
a
gap
,
or
break
in
the
hedge
at
the
top
,
indicating
plainly
the
place
at
which
a
horse
could
best
get
over
.
<EOS>
To
this
spot
Vavasor
followed
,
and
was
on
the
bank
at
Burgo
's
heels
before
he
knew
what
had
happened
.
<EOS>
But
the
man
had
got
away
and
only
the
horse
lay
there
in
the
ditch
.
<EOS>
"
Are
you
hurt
?
"
said
Vavasor
;
"
can
I
do
anything
?
"
<EOS>
But
he
did
not
stop
,
"
If
you
can
find
a
chap
just
send
him
to
me
,
"
said
Burgo
in
a
melancholy
tone
.
<EOS>
Then
he
sat
down
,
with
his
feet
in
the
ditch
,
and
looked
at
the
carcase
of
his
horse
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
no
more
need
of
jumping
that
day
.
<EOS>
The
way
was
open
into
the
next
field
,
 
a
turnip
field
,
 
and
there
amidst
the
crisp
breaking
turnip
-
tops
,
with
the
breath
of
his
enemies
hot
upon
him
,
with
their
sharp
teeth
at
his
entrails
,
biting
at
them
impotently
in
the
agonies
of
his
death
struggle
,
poor
Reynard
finished
his
career
.
<EOS>
Maxwell
was
certainly
the
first
there
,
 
but
Sir
William
and
George
Vavasor
were
close
upon
him
.
<EOS>
That
taking
of
brushes
of
which
we
used
to
hear
is
a
little
out
of
fashion
;
but
if
such
honour
were
due
to
any
one
it
was
due
to
Vavasor
,
for
he
and
he
only
had
ridden
the
hunt
throughout
.
<EOS>
But
he
claimed
no
honour
,
and
none
was
specially
given
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
and
Maxwell
rode
homewards
together
,
having
sent
assistance
to
poor
Burgo
Fitzgerald
;
and
as
they
went
along
the
road
,
saying
but
little
to
each
other
,
Maxwell
,
in
a
very
indifferent
voice
,
asked
him
a
question
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
want
for
that
horse
,
Vavasor
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
hundred
and
fifty
,
"
said
Vavasor
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
's
mine
,
"
said
Maxwell
.
<EOS>
So
the
brown
horse
was
sold
for
about
half
his
value
,
because
he
had
brought
with
him
a
bad
character
.
   
<EOS>
Alice
Vavasor
's
Great
Relations
.
 
<EOS>
Burgo
Fitzgerald
,
of
whose
hunting
experiences
something
has
been
told
in
the
last
chapter
,
was
a
young
man
born
in
the
purple
of
the
English
aristocracy
.
<EOS>
He
was
related
to
half
the
dukes
in
the
kingdom
,
and
had
three
countesses
for
his
aunts
.
<EOS>
When
he
came
of
age
he
was
master
of
a
sufficient
fortune
to
make
it
quite
out
of
the
question
that
he
should
be
asked
to
earn
his
bread
;
and
though
that
,
and
other
windfalls
that
had
come
to
him
,
had
long
since
been
spent
,
no
one
had
ever
made
to
him
so
ridiculous
a
proposition
as
that
.
<EOS>
He
was
now
thirty
,
and
for
some
years
past
had
been
known
to
be
much
worse
than
penniless
;
but
still
he
lived
on
in
the
same
circles
,
still
slept
softly
and
drank
of
the
best
,
and
went
about
with
his
valet
and
his
groom
and
his
horses
,
and
fared
sumptuously
every
day
.
<EOS>
Some
people
said
the
countesses
did
it
for
him
,
and
some
said
that
it
was
the
dukes
;
 
while
others
,
again
,
declared
that
the
Jews
were
his
most
generous
friends
.
<EOS>
At
any
rate
he
still
seemed
to
live
as
he
had
always
lived
,
setting
tradesmen
at
defiance
,
and
laughing
to
scorn
all
the
rules
which
regulate
the
lives
of
other
men
.
  
<EOS>
About
eighteen
months
before
the
time
of
which
I
am
now
speaking
,
a
great
chance
had
come
in
this
young
man
's
way
,
and
he
had
almost
succeeded
in
making
himself
one
of
the
richest
men
in
England
.
<EOS>
There
had
been
then
a
great
heiress
in
the
land
,
on
whom
the
properties
of
half
-
a
-
dozen
ancient
families
had
concentrated
;
and
Burgo
,
who
in
spite
of
his
iniquities
still
kept
his
position
in
the
drawing
-
rooms
of
the
great
,
had
almost
succeeded
in
obtaining
the
hand
and
the
wealth
,
 
as
people
still
said
that
he
had
obtained
the
heart
,
 
of
the
Lady
Glencora
M'Cluskie
.
<EOS>
But
sundry
mighty
magnates
,
driven
almost
to
despair
at
the
prospect
of
such
a
sacrifice
,
had
sagaciously
put
their
heads
together
,
and
the
result
had
been
that
the
Lady
Glencora
had
heard
reason
.
<EOS>
She
had
listened
,
 
with
many
haughty
tossings
indeed
of
her
proud
little
head
,
with
many
throbbings
of
her
passionate
young
heart
;
but
in
the
end
she
listened
and
heard
reason
.
<EOS>
She
saw
Burgo
,
for
the
last
time
,
and
told
him
that
she
was
the
promised
bride
of
Plantagenet
Palliser
,
nephew
and
heir
of
the
Duke
of
Omnium
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
borne
it
like
a
man
,
 
never
having
groaned
openly
,
or
quivered
once
before
any
comrade
at
the
name
of
the
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
She
had
married
Mr.
Palliser
at
St.
George
's
Square
,
and
on
the
morning
of
the
marriage
he
had
hung
about
his
club
door
in
Pall
Mall
,
listening
to
the
bells
,
and
saying
a
word
or
two
about
the
wedding
,
with
admirable
courage
.
<EOS>
It
had
been
for
him
a
great
chance
,
 
and
he
had
lost
it
.
<EOS>
Who
can
say
,
too
,
that
his
only
regret
was
for
the
money
?
<EOS>
He
had
spoken
once
of
it
to
a
married
sister
of
his
,
in
whose
house
he
had
first
met
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
never
marry
now
,
 
that
is
all
,
"
he
said
 
<EOS>
and
then
he
went
about
,
living
his
old
reckless
life
,
with
the
same
recklessness
as
ever
.
<EOS>
He
was
one
of
those
young
men
with
dark
hair
and
blue
eyes
,
 
who
wear
no
beard
,
and
are
certainly
among
the
handsomest
of
all
God
's
creatures
.
<EOS>
No
more
handsome
man
than
Burgo
Fitzgerald
lived
in
his
days
;
and
this
merit
at
any
rate
was
his
,
 
that
he
thought
nothing
of
his
own
beauty
.
<EOS>
But
he
lived
ever
without
conscience
,
without
purpose
,
 
with
no
idea
that
it
behoved
him
as
a
man
to
do
anything
but
eat
and
drink
,
 
or
ride
well
to
hounds
till
some
poor
brute
,
much
nobler
than
himself
,
perished
beneath
him
.
  
<EOS>
He
chiefly
concerns
our
story
at
this
present
time
because
the
Lady
Glencora
who
had
loved
him
,
 
and
would
have
married
<EOS>
him
had
not
those
sagacious
heads
prevented
it
<EOS>
,
 
was
a
cousin
of
Alice
Vavasor
's
.
<EOS>
She
was
among
those
very
great
relations
with
whom
Alice
was
connected
by
her
mother
's
side
,
 
being
indeed
so
near
to
Lady
Macleod
,
that
she
was
first
cousin
to
that
lady
,
only
once
removed
.
<EOS>
Lady
Midlothian
was
aunt
to
the
Lady
Glencora
,
and
our
Alice
might
have
called
cousins
,
and
not
been
forbidden
,
with
the
old
Lord
of
the
Isles
,
Lady
Glencora
's
father
,
 
who
was
dead
,
however
,
some
time
previous
to
that
affair
with
Burgo
,
 
and
with
the
Marquis
of
Auld
Reekie
,
who
was
Lady
Glencora
's
uncle
,
and
had
been
her
guardian
.
<EOS>
But
Alice
had
kept
herself
aloof
from
her
grand
relations
on
her
mother
's
side
,
choosing
rather
to
hold
herself
as
belonging
to
those
who
were
her
father
's
kindred
.
<EOS>
With
Lady
Glencora
,
however
,
she
had
for
a
short
time
 
for
some
week
or
ten
days
,
 
been
on
terms
of
almost
affectionate
intimacy
.
<EOS>
It
had
been
then
,
when
the
wayward
heiress
with
the
bright
waving
locks
had
been
most
strongly
minded
to
give
herself
and
her
wealth
to
Burgo
Fitzgerald
.
<EOS>
Burgo
had
had
money
dealings
with
George
Vavasor
,
and
knew
him
,
 
knew
him
intimately
,
and
had
learned
the
fact
of
his
cousinship
between
the
heiress
and
his
friend
's
cousin
.
<EOS>
Whereupon
in
the
agony
of
those
weeks
in
which
the
sagacious
heads
were
resisting
her
love
,
Lady
Glencora
came
to
her
cousin
in
Queen
Anne
Street
,
and
told
Alice
all
that
tale
.
"
<EOS>
Was
Alice
,
"
she
asked
,
"
afraid
of
the
marquises
and
the
countesses
,
or
of
all
the
rank
and
all
the
money
which
they
boasted
?
"
<EOS>
Alice
answered
that
she
was
not
at
all
afraid
of
them
.
"
<EOS>
Then
would
she
permit
Lady
Glencora
and
Burgo
to
see
each
other
in
the
drawing
-
room
at
Queen
Anne
Street
,
just
once
!
"
<EOS>
Just
once
,
 
so
that
they
might
arrange
that
little
plan
of
an
elopement
.
<EOS>
But
Alice
could
not
do
that
for
her
newly
found
cousin
.
<EOS>
She
endeavoured
to
explain
that
it
was
not
the
dignity
of
the
sagacious
heads
which
stood
in
her
way
,
but
her
woman
's
feeling
of
what
was
right
and
wrong
in
such
a
matter
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
should
I
not
marry
him
?
"
said
Lady
Glencora
,
with
her
eyes
flashing
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
is
my
equal
.
"
  
<EOS>
Alice
explained
that
she
had
no
word
to
say
against
such
a
marriage
.
<EOS>
She
counselled
her
cousin
to
be
true
to
her
love
if
her
love
was
in
itself
true
.
<EOS>
But
she
,
an
unmarried
woman
,
who
had
hitherto
not
known
her
cousin
,
might
not
give
such
help
as
that
!
<EOS>
"
If
you
will
not
help
me
,
I
am
helpless
!
"
said
the
Lady
Glencora
,
and
then
she
kneeled
at
Alice
's
knees
and
threw
her
wavy
locks
abroad
on
Alice
's
lap
.
<EOS>
"
How
shall
I
bribe
you
?
"
said
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
"
Next
to
him
I
will
love
you
better
than
all
the
world
.
"
<EOS>
But
Alice
,
though
she
kissed
the
fair
forehead
and
owned
that
such
reward
would
be
worth
much
to
her
,
could
not
take
any
bribe
for
such
a
cause
.
<EOS>
Then
Lady
Glencora
had
been
angry
with
her
,
calling
her
heartless
,
and
threatening
her
that
she
too
might
have
sorrow
of
her
own
and
want
assistance
.
<EOS>
Alice
told
nothing
of
her
own
tale
,
 
how
she
had
loved
her
cousin
and
had
been
forced
to
give
him
up
,
but
said
what
kind
words
she
could
,
and
she
of
the
waving
hair
and
light
blue
eyes
had
been
pacified
.
<EOS>
Then
she
had
come
again
,
 
had
come
daily
while
the
sagacious
heads
were
at
work
,
 
and
Alice
in
her
trouble
had
been
a
comfort
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
But
the
sagacious
heads
were
victorious
,
as
we
know
,
and
Lady
Glencora
M'Cluskie
became
Lady
Glencora
Palliser
with
all
the
propriety
in
the
world
,
instead
of
becoming
wife
to
poor
Burgo
,
with
all
imaginable
impropriety
.
<EOS>
And
then
she
wrote
a
letter
to
Alice
,
very
short
and
rather
sad
;
but
still
with
a
certain
sweetness
in
it
.
<EOS>
"
She
had
been
counselled
that
it
was
not
fitting
for
her
to
love
as
she
had
thought
to
love
,
and
she
had
resolved
to
give
up
her
dream
.
<EOS>
Her
cousin
Alice
,
she
knew
,
would
respect
her
secret
.
<EOS>
She
was
going
to
become
the
wife
of
the
best
man
<EOS>
,
she
thought
,
in
all
the
world
;
and
it
should
be
the
one
care
of
her
life
to
make
him
happy
.
"
<EOS>
She
said
not
a
word
in
all
her
letter
of
loving
this
newly
found
lord
.
<EOS>
"
She
was
to
be
married
at
once
.
<EOS>
Would
Alice
be
one
among
the
bevy
of
bridesmaids
who
were
to
grace
the
ceremony
?
"
  
<EOS>
Alice
wished
her
joy
heartily
,
 
"
heartily
,
"
she
said
,
but
had
declined
that
office
of
bridesmaid
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
wish
to
undergo
the
cold
looks
of
the
Lady
Julias
and
Lady
Janes
who
all
would
know
each
other
,
but
none
of
whom
would
know
her
.
<EOS>
So
she
sent
her
cousin
a
little
ring
,
and
asked
her
to
keep
it
amidst
all
the
wealthy
tribute
of
marriage
gifts
which
would
be
poured
forth
at
her
feet
.
  
<EOS>
From
that
time
to
this
present
Alice
had
heard
no
more
of
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
married
late
in
the
preceding
season
and
had
gone
away
with
Mr.
Palliser
,
spending
her
honeymoon
amidst
the
softnesses
of
some
Italian
lake
.
<EOS>
They
had
not
returned
to
England
till
the
time
had
come
for
them
to
encounter
the
magnificent
Christmas
festivities
of
Mr.
Palliser
's
uncle
,
the
Duke
.
<EOS>
On
this
occasion
Gatherum
Castle
,
the
vast
palace
which
the
Duke
had
built
at
a
cost
of
nearly
a
quarter
of
a
million
,
was
opened
,
as
it
had
never
been
opened
before
;
 
for
the
Duke
's
heir
had
married
to
the
Duke
's
liking
,
and
the
Duke
was
a
man
who
could
do
such
things
handsomely
when
he
was
well
pleased
.
<EOS>
Then
there
had
been
a
throng
of
bridal
guests
,
and
a
succession
of
bridal
gaieties
which
had
continued
themselves
even
past
the
time
at
which
Mr.
Palliser
was
due
at
Westminster
;
 
and
Mr.
Palliser
was
a
legislator
who
served
his
country
with
the
utmost
assiduity
.
<EOS>
So
the
London
season
commenced
,
progressed
,
and
was
consumed
;
and
still
Alice
heard
nothing
more
of
her
friend
and
cousin
Lady
Glencora
.
  
<EOS>
But
this
had
troubled
her
not
at
all
.
<EOS>
A
chance
circumstance
,
the
story
of
which
she
had
told
to
no
one
,
had
given
her
a
short
intimacy
with
this
fair
child
of
the
gold
mines
,
but
she
had
felt
that
they
two
could
not
live
together
in
habits
of
much
intimacy
.
<EOS>
She
had
,
when
thinking
of
the
young
bride
,
only
thought
of
that
wild
love
episode
in
the
girl
's
life
.
<EOS>
It
had
been
strange
to
her
that
she
should
in
one
week
have
listened
to
the
most
passionate
protestations
from
her
friend
of
love
for
one
man
,
and
then
have
been
told
in
the
next
that
another
man
was
to
be
her
friend
's
husband
!
<EOS>
But
she
reflected
that
her
own
career
was
much
the
same
,
 
only
with
the
interval
of
some
longer
time
.
  
<EOS>
But
her
own
career
was
not
the
same
.
<EOS>
Glencora
had
married
Mr.
Palliser
,
 
had
married
him
without
pausing
to
doubt
;
 
but
Alice
had
gone
on
doubting
till
at
last
<EOS>
she
had
resolved
that
she
would
not
marry
Mr.
Grey
.
<EOS>
She
thought
of
this
much
in
those
days
at
Cheltenham
,
and
wondered
often
whether
Glencora
lived
with
her
husband
in
the
full
happiness
of
conjugal
love
.
  
<EOS>
One
morning
,
about
three
days
after
Mr.
Grey
's
visit
,
there
came
to
her
two
letters
,
as
to
neither
of
which
did
she
know
the
writer
by
the
handwriting
.
<EOS>
Lady
Macleod
had
told
her
,
 
with
some
hesitation
,
indeed
,
for
Lady
Macleod
was
afraid
of
her
,
 
but
had
told
her
,
nevertheless
,
more
than
once
,
that
those
noble
relatives
had
heard
of
the
treatment
to
which
Mr.
Grey
was
being
subjected
,
and
had
expressed
their
great
sorrow
,
 
if
not
dismay
or
almost
anger
.
<EOS>
Lady
Macleod
,
indeed
,
had
gone
as
far
as
she
dared
,
and
might
have
gone
further
without
any
sacrifice
of
truth
.
<EOS>
Lady
Midlothian
had
said
that
it
would
be
disgraceful
to
the
family
,
and
Lady
Glencora
's
aunt
,
the
Marchioness
of
Auld
Reekie
,
had
demanded
to
be
told
what
it
was
the
girl
wanted
.
  
<EOS>
When
the
letters
came
Lady
Macleod
was
not
present
,
and
I
am
disposed
to
think
that
one
of
them
had
been
written
by
concerted
arrangement
with
her
.
<EOS>
But
if
so
she
had
not
dared
to
watch
the
immediate
effect
of
her
own
projectile
.
<EOS>
This
one
was
from
Lady
Midlothian
.
<EOS>
Of
the
other
Lady
Macleod
certainly
knew
nothing
,
though
it
also
had
sprung
out
of
the
discussions
which
had
taken
place
as
to
Alice
's
sins
in
the
Auld
Reekie
-
Midlothian
set
.
<EOS>
This
other
letter
was
from
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
Alice
opened
the
two
,
one
without
reading
the
other
,
very
slowly
.
<EOS>
Lady
Midlothian
's
was
the
first
opened
,
and
then
came
a
spot
of
anger
on
Alice
's
cheeks
as
she
saw
the
signature
,
and
caught
a
word
or
two
as
she
allowed
her
eye
to
glance
down
the
page
.
<EOS>
Then
she
opened
the
other
,
which
was
shorter
,
and
when
she
saw
her
cousin
's
signature
,
"
Glencora
Palliser
,
"
she
read
that
letter
first
,
 
read
it
twice
before
she
went
back
to
the
disagreeable
task
of
perusing
Lady
Midlothian
's
lecture
.
<EOS>
The
reader
shall
have
both
the
letters
,
but
that
from
the
Countess
shall
have
precedence
.

MY
DEAR
MISS
VAVASOR
,
  
<EOS>
I
have
not
the
pleasure
of
knowing
you
personally
,
though
I
have
heard
of
you
very
often
from
our
dear
mutual
friend
and
relative
Lady
Macleod
,
with
whom
I
understand
that
you
are
at
present
on
a
visit
.
<EOS>
Your
grandmother
,
 
by
the
mother
's
side
,
 
Lady
Flora
Macleod
,
and
my
mother
the
Countess
of
Leith
,
were
half
-
sisters
;
and
though
circumstances
since
that
have
prevented
our
seeing
so
much
of
each
other
as
is
desirable
,
I
have
always
remembered
the
connection
,
and
have
ever
regarded
you
as
one
in
whose
welfare
I
am
bound
by
ties
of
blood
to
take
a
warm
interest
.
  
<EOS>
"
"
Since
that
!
"
 
<EOS>
what
does
she
mean
by
"
since
that
'
?
"
said
Alice
to
herself
.
<EOS>
"
She
has
never
set
eyes
on
me
at
all
.
<EOS>
Why
does
she
talk
of
not
having
seen
as
much
of
me
as
is
desirable
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
had
learned
with
great
gratification
that
you
were
going
to
be
married
to
a
most
worthy
gentleman
,
Mr.
John
Grey
of
Nethercoats
,
in
Cambridgeshire
.
<EOS>
When
I
first
heard
this
I
made
it
my
business
to
institute
some
inquiries
,
and
I
was
heartily
glad
to
find
that
your
choice
had
done
you
so
much
credit
.
<EOS>
[
If
the
reader
has
read
Alice
's
character
as
I
have
meant
it
should
be
read
,
it
will
thoroughly
be
understood
that
this
was
wormwood
to
her
.
]
<EOS>
I
was
informed
that
Mr.
Grey
is
in
every
respect
a
gentleman
,
 
that
he
is
a
man
of
most
excellent
habits
,
and
one
to
whom
any
young
woman
could
commit
her
future
happiness
with
security
,
that
his
means
are
very
good
for
his
position
,
and
that
there
was
no
possible
objection
to
such
a
marriage
.
<EOS>
All
this
gave
great
satisfaction
to
me
,
in
which
I
was
joined
by
the
Marchioness
of
Auld
Reekie
,
who
is
connected
with
you
almost
as
nearly
as
I
am
,
and
who
,
I
can
assure
you
,
feels
a
considerable
interest
in
your
welfare
.
<EOS>
I
am
staying
with
her
now
,
and
in
all
that
I
say
,
she
agrees
with
me
.
  
<EOS>
You
may
feel
then
how
dreadfully
we
were
dismayed
when
we
were
told
by
dear
Lady
Macleod
that
you
had
told
Mr.
Grey
that
you
intended
to
change
your
mind
!
<EOS>
My
dear
Miss
Vavasor
,
can
this
be
true
?
<EOS>
There
are
things
in
which
a
young
lady
has
no
right
to
change
her
mind
after
it
has
been
once
made
up
;
and
certainly
when
a
young
lady
has
accepted
a
gentleman
,
that
is
one
of
them
.
<EOS>
He
can
not
legally
make
you
become
his
wife
,
but
he
has
a
right
to
claim
you
before
God
and
man
.
<EOS>
Have
you
considered
that
he
has
probably
furnished
his
house
in
consequence
of
his
intended
marriage
,
 
and
perhaps
in
compliance
with
your
own
especial
wishes
?
<EOS>
[
I
think
that
Lady
Macleod
must
have
told
the
Countess
something
that
she
had
heard
about
the
garden
.
]
<EOS>
Have
you
reflected
that
he
has
of
course
told
all
his
friends
?
<EOS>
Have
you
any
reason
to
give
?
<EOS>
I
am
told
,
none
!
<EOS>
Nothing
should
ever
be
done
without
a
reason
;
much
less
such
a
thing
as
this
in
which
your
own
interests
and
,
I
may
say
,
respectability
are
involved
.
<EOS>
I
hope
you
will
think
of
this
before
you
persist
in
destroying
your
own
happiness
and
perhaps
that
of
a
very
worthy
man
.
  
<EOS>
I
had
heard
,
some
years
ago
,
when
you
were
much
younger
,
that
you
had
become
imprudently
attached
in
another
direction
 
with
a
gentleman
with
none
of
those
qualities
to
recommend
him
which
speak
so
highly
for
Mr.
Grey
.
<EOS>
It
would
grieve
me
very
much
,
as
it
would
also
the
Marchioness
,
who
in
this
matter
thinks
exactly
as
I
do
,
if
I
were
led
to
suppose
that
your
rejection
of
Mr.
Grey
had
been
caused
by
_
any
renewal
of
that
project
_
.
<EOS>
Nothing
,
my
dear
Miss
Vavasor
,
could
be
more
unfortunate
,
 
and
I
might
almost
add
a
stronger
word
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
been
advised
that
a
line
from
me
as
representing
your
poor
mother
's
family
,
especially
as
I
have
at
the
present
moment
the
opportunity
of
expressing
Lady
<EOS>
Auld
Reekie
's
sentiments
as
well
as
my
own
,
might
be
of
service
.
<EOS>
I
implore
you
,
my
dear
Miss
Vavasor
,
to
remember
what
you
owe
to
God
and
man
,
and
to
carry
out
an
engagement
made
by
yourself
,
that
is
in
all
respects
comme
il
faut
,
and
which
will
give
entire
satisfaction
to
your
friends
and
relatives
.
  
<EOS>
MARGARET
M.
MIDLOTHIAN
.
  
<EOS>
I
think
that
Lady
Macleod
had
been
wrong
in
supposing
that
this
could
do
any
good
.
<EOS>
She
should
have
known
Alice
better
;
and
should
also
have
known
the
world
better
.
<EOS>
But
her
own
reverence
for
her
own
noble
relatives
was
so
great
that
she
could
not
understand
,
even
yet
,
that
all
such
feeling
was
wanting
to
her
niece
.
<EOS>
It
was
to
her
impossible
that
the
expressed
opinion
of
such
an
one
as
the
Countess
of
Midlothian
,
owning
her
relationship
and
solicitude
,
and
condescending
at
the
same
time
to
express
friendship
,
 
she
could
not
,
I
say
,
understand
that
the
voice
of
such
an
one
,
so
speaking
,
should
have
no
weight
<EOS>
whatever
.
<EOS>
But
I
think
that
she
had
been
quite
right
in
keeping
out
of
Alice
's
way
at
the
moment
of
the
arrival
of
the
letter
.
<EOS>
Alice
read
it
,
slowly
,
and
then
replacing
it
in
its
envelope
,
leaned
back
quietly
in
her
chair
,
 
with
her
eyes
fixed
upon
the
teapot
on
the
table
.
<EOS>
She
had
,
however
,
the
other
letter
on
which
to
occupy
her
mind
,
and
thus
relieve
her
from
the
effects
of
too
deep
an
animosity
against
the
Countess
.
  
<EOS>
The
Lady
Glencora
's
letter
was
as
follows
:
  
<EOS>
Matching
Priory
,
Thursday
.
  
<EOS>
DEAR
COUSIN
,
  
<EOS>
I
have
just
come
home
from
Scotland
,
where
they
have
been
telling
me
something
of
your
little
troubles
.
<EOS>
I
had
little
troubles
once
too
,
and
you
were
so
good
to
me
!
<EOS>
Will
you
come
to
us
here
for
a
few
weeks
?
<EOS>
We
shall
be
here
till
Christmas
-
time
,
when
we
go
somewhere
else
.
<EOS>
I
have
told
my
husband
that
you
are
a
great
friend
of
mine
as
well
as
a
cousin
,
and
that
he
must
be
good
to
you
.
<EOS>
He
is
very
quiet
,
and
works
very
hard
at
politics
;
but
I
think
you
will
like
him
.
<EOS>
Do
come
!
<EOS>
There
will
be
a
good
many
people
here
,
so
that
you
will
not
find
it
dull
.
<EOS>
If
you
will
name
the
day
we
will
send
the
carriage
for
you
at
Matching
Station
,
and
I
dare
say
I
can
manage
to
come
myself
.
  
<EOS>
Yours
affectionately
,
  
G.
PALLISER
.
  
<EOS>
P.S.
<EOS>
I
know
what
will
be
in
your
mind
.
<EOS>
You
will
say
,
why
did
not
she
come
to
me
in
London
?
<EOS>
She
knew
the
way
to
Queen
Anne
Street
well
enough
.
<EOS>
Dear
Alice
,
do
n't
say
that
.
<EOS>
Believe
me
,
I
had
much
to
do
and
think
of
in
London
.
<EOS>
And
if
I
was
wrong
,
yet
you
will
forgive
me
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
says
I
am
to
give
you
his
love
,
 
as
being
a
cousin
,
 
and
say
that
you
must
come
!
  
<EOS>
This
letter
was
certainly
better
than
the
other
,
but
Alice
,
on
reading
it
,
came
to
a
resolve
that
she
would
not
accept
the
invitation
.
<EOS>
In
the
first
place
,
even
that
allusion
to
her
little
troubles
jarred
upon
her
feelings
;
and
then
she
thought
that
her
rejection
of
Mr.
Grey
could
be
no
special
reason
why
she
should
go
to
Matching
Priory
.
<EOS>
Was
it
not
very
possible
that
she
had
been
invited
that
she
might
meet
Lady
Midlothian
there
,
and
encounter
all
the
strength
of
a
personal
battery
from
the
Countess
?
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
's
letter
she
would
of
course
answer
,
but
to
Lady
Midlothian
she
would
not
condescend
to
make
any
reply
whatever
.
  
<EOS>
About
eleven
o'clock
Lady
Macleod
came
down
to
her
.
<EOS>
For
half
-
an
-
hour
or
so
Alice
said
nothing
;
nor
did
Lady
Macleod
ask
any
question
.
<EOS>
She
looked
inquisitively
at
Alice
,
eyeing
the
letter
which
was
lying
by
the
side
of
her
niece
's
workbasket
,
but
she
said
no
word
about
Mr.
Grey
or
the
Countess
.
<EOS>
At
last
Alice
spoke
.
  
<EOS>
"
Aunt
,
"
she
said
,
"
I
have
had
a
letter
this
morning
from
your
friend
,
Lady
Midlothian
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
is
my
cousin
,
Alice
;
and
yours
as
much
as
mine
.
"
  
"
Your
cousin
then
,
aunt
.
<EOS>
But
it
is
of
more
moment
that
she
is
your
friend
.
<EOS>
She
certainly
is
not
mine
,
nor
can
her
cousinship
afford
any
justification
for
her
interfering
in
my
affairs
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Alice
,
 
from
her
position
 
"
  
"
Her
position
can
be
nothing
to
me
,
aunt
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
submit
to
it
.
<EOS>
There
is
her
letter
,
which
you
can
read
if
you
please
.
<EOS>
After
that
you
may
burn
it
.
<EOS>
I
need
hardly
say
that
I
shall
not
answer
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
what
am
I
to
say
to
her
,
Alice
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Nothing
from
me
,
aunt
;
 
from
yourself
,
whatever
you
please
,
of
course
.
<EOS>
"
Then
there
was
silence
between
them
for
a
few
minutes
.
"
<EOS>
And
I
have
had
another
letter
,
from
Lady
Glencora
,
who
married
Mr.
Palliser
,
and
whom
I
knew
in
London
last
spring
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
has
that
offended
you
,
too
?
"
  
"
No
,
there
is
no
offence
in
that
.
<EOS>
She
asks
me
to
go
and
see
her
at
Matching
Priory
,
her
husband
's
house
;
but
I
shall
not
go
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
But
at
last
Alice
agreed
to
pay
this
visit
,
and
it
may
be
as
well
to
explain
here
how
she
was
brought
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
She
wrote
to
Lady
Glencora
,
declining
,
and
explaining
frankly
that
she
did
decline
,
because
she
thought
it
probable
that
she
might
there
meet
Lady
Midlothian
.
<EOS>
Lady
Midlothian
,
she
said
,
had
interfered
very
unwarrantably
in
her
affairs
,
and
she
did
not
wish
to
make
her
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
To
this
Lady
Glencora
replied
,
post
haste
,
that
she
had
intended
no
such
horrid
treachery
as
that
for
Alice
;
that
neither
would
Lady
Midlothian
be
there
,
nor
any
of
that
set
;
by
which
Alice
knew
that
Lady
Glencora
referred
specially
to
her
aunt
the
Marchioness
;
that
no
one
would
be
at
Matching
who
could
torment
Alice
,
either
with
right
or
without
it
,
"
except
so
far
as
I
myself
may
do
so
,
"
Lady
Glencora
said
;
and
then
she
named
an
early
day
in
November
,
at
which
she
would
herself
undertake
to
meet
Alice
at
the
Matching
Station
.
<EOS>
On
receipt
of
this
letter
,
Alice
,
after
two
days
'
doubt
,
accepted
the
invitation
.
   
<EOS>
Tribute
from
Oileymead
.
 
<EOS>
Kate
Vavasor
,
in
writing
to
her
cousin
Alice
,
felt
some
little
difficulty
in
excusing
herself
for
remaining
in
Norfolk
with
Mrs.
Greenow
.
<EOS>
She
had
laughed
at
Mrs.
Greenow
before
she
went
to
Yarmouth
,
and
had
laughed
at
herself
for
going
there
.
<EOS>
And
in
all
her
letters
since
,
she
had
spoken
of
her
aunt
as
a
silly
,
vain
,
worldly
woman
,
weeping
crocodile
tears
,
for
an
old
husband
whose
death
had
released
her
from
the
tedium
of
his
company
,
and
spreading
lures
to
catch
new
lovers
.
<EOS>
But
yet
she
agreed
to
stay
with
her
aunt
,
and
remain
with
her
in
lodgings
at
Norwich
for
a
month
.
  
<EOS>
But
Mrs.
Greenow
had
about
her
something
more
than
Kate
had
acknowledged
when
she
first
attempted
to
read
her
aunt
's
character
.
<EOS>
She
was
clever
,
and
in
her
own
way
persuasive
.
<EOS>
She
was
very
generous
,
and
possessed
a
certain
power
of
making
herself
pleasant
to
those
around
her
.
<EOS>
In
asking
Kate
to
stay
with
her
she
had
so
asked
as
to
make
it
appear
that
Kate
was
to
confer
the
favour
.
<EOS>
She
had
told
her
niece
that
she
was
all
alone
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
money
,
"
she
had
said
,
with
more
appearance
of
true
feeling
than
Kate
had
observed
before
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
money
,
but
I
have
nothing
else
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
home
.
<EOS>
Why
should
I
not
remain
here
in
Norfolk
,
where
I
know
a
few
people
?
<EOS>
If
you
'll
say
that
you
'll
go
anywhere
else
with
me
,
I
'll
go
to
any
place
you
'll
name
.
<EOS>
"
Kate
had
believed
this
to
be
hardly
true
.
<EOS>
She
had
felt
sure
that
her
aunt
wished
to
remain
in
the
neighbourhood
of
her
seaside
admirers
;
but
,
nevertheless
,
she
had
yielded
,
and
at
the
end
of
October
the
two
ladies
,
with
Jeannette
,
settled
themselves
in
comfortable
lodgings
within
the
precincts
of
the
Close
at
Norwich
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Greenow
at
this
time
had
been
dead
very
nearly
six
months
,
but
his
widow
made
some
mistakes
in
her
dates
and
appeared
to
think
that
the
interval
had
been
longer
.
<EOS>
On
the
day
of
their
arrival
at
Norwich
it
was
evident
that
this
error
had
confirmed
itself
in
her
mind
.
"
<EOS>
Only
think
,
"
she
said
,
as
she
unpacked
a
little
miniature
of
the
departed
one
,
and
sat
with
it
for
a
moment
in
her
hands
,
as
she
pressed
her
handkerchief
to
her
eyes
,
"
only
think
,
that
it
is
barely
nine
months
since
he
was
with
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Six
,
you
mean
,
aunt
,
"
said
Kate
,
unadvisedly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Only
nine
months
"
repeated
Mrs.
Greenow
,
as
though
she
had
not
heard
her
niece
.
"
<EOS>
Only
nine
months
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
After
that
Kate
attempted
to
correct
no
more
such
errors
.
<EOS>
"
It
happened
in
May
,
Miss
,
"
Jeannette
said
afterwards
to
Miss
Vavasor
,
"
and
that
,
as
we
reckons
,
it
will
be
just
a
twelvemonth
come
Christmas
.
"
<EOS>
But
Kate
paid
no
attention
to
this
.
  
<EOS>
And
Jeannette
was
very
ungrateful
,
and
certainly
should
have
indulged
herself
in
no
such
sarcasms
.
<EOS>
When
Mrs.
Greenow
made
a
slight
change
in
her
mourning
,
which
she
did
on
her
arrival
at
Norwich
,
using
a
little
lace
among
her
crapes
,
Jeannette
reaped
a
rich
harvest
in
gifts
of
clothes
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Greenow
knew
well
enough
that
she
expected
more
from
a
servant
than
mere
service
;
 
that
she
wanted
loyalty
,
discretion
,
and
perhaps
sometimes
a
little
secrecy
;
 
and
as
she
paid
for
these
things
,
she
should
have
had
them
.
  
<EOS>
Kate
undertook
to
stay
a
month
with
her
aunt
at
Norwich
,
and
Mrs.
Greenow
undertook
that
Mr.
Cheesacre
should
declare
himself
as
Kate
's
lover
,
before
the
expiration
of
the
month
.
<EOS>
It
was
in
vain
that
Kate
protested
that
she
wanted
no
such
lover
,
and
that
she
would
certainly
reject
him
if
he
came
.
<EOS>
"
That
's
all
very
well
,
my
dear
,
"
Aunt
Greenow
would
say
.
<EOS>
"
A
girl
must
settle
herself
some
day
,
you
know
;
 
and
you
'd
have
it
all
your
own
way
at
Oileymead
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
But
the
offer
certainly
showed
much
generosity
on
the
part
of
Aunt
Greenow
,
inasmuch
as
Mr.
Cheesacre
's
attentions
were
apparently
paid
to
herself
rather
than
to
her
niece
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Cheesacre
was
very
attentive
.
<EOS>
He
had
taken
the
lodgings
in
the
Close
,
and
had
sent
over
fowls
and
cream
from
Oileymead
,
and
had
called
on
the
morning
after
their
arrival
;
but
in
all
his
attentions
he
distinguished
the
aunt
more
particularly
than
the
niece
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
all
for
Mr.
Cheesacre
,
Miss
,
"
said
Jeannette
once
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
Captain
is
perhaps
the
nicerer
-
looking
gentleman
,
and
he
ai
n't
so
podgy
like
;
but
what
's
good
looks
if
a
gentleman
has
n't
got
nothing
?
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
abide
anything
that
's
poor
;
neither
ca
n't
Missus
.
"
<EOS>
From
which
it
was
evident
that
Jeannette
gave
Miss
Vavasor
no
credit
in
having
Mr.
Cheesacre
in
her
train
.
  
<EOS>
Captain
Bellfield
was
also
at
Norwich
,
having
obtained
some
quasi
-
military
employment
there
in
the
matter
of
drilling
volunteers
.
<EOS>
Certain
capacities
in
that
line
it
may
be
supposed
that
he
possessed
,
and
,
as
his
friend
Cheesacre
said
of
him
,
he
was
going
to
earn
an
honest
penny
once
in
his
life
.
<EOS>
The
Captain
and
Mr.
Cheesacre
had
made
up
any
little
differences
that
had
existed
between
them
at
Yarmouth
,
and
were
close
allies
again
when
they
left
that
place
.
<EOS>
Some
little
compact
on
matters
of
business
must
have
been
arranged
between
them
,
 
for
the
Captain
<EOS>
was
in
funds
again
.
<EOS>
He
was
in
funds
again
through
the
liberality
of
his
friend
,
 
and
no
payment
of
former
loans
had
been
made
,
nor
had
there
been
any
speech
of
such
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Cheesacre
had
drawn
his
purse
-
strings
liberally
,
and
had
declared
that
if
all
went
well
the
hospitality
of
Oileymead
should
not
be
wanting
during
the
winter
.
<EOS>
Captain
Bellfield
had
nodded
his
head
and
declared
that
all
should
go
well
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
wo
n't
see
much
of
the
Captain
,
I
suppose
,
"
said
Mr.
Cheesacre
to
Mrs.
Greenow
on
the
morning
of
the
day
after
her
arrival
at
Norwich
.
<EOS>
He
had
come
across
the
whole
way
from
Oileymead
to
ask
her
if
she
found
herself
comfortable
,
 
and
perhaps
with
an
eye
to
the
Norwich
markets
at
the
same
time
.
<EOS>
He
now
wore
a
pair
of
black
riding
boots
over
his
trousers
,
and
a
round
topped
hat
,
and
looked
much
more
at
home
than
he
had
done
by
the
seaside
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
much
,
I
dare
say
,
"
said
the
widow
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
tells
me
that
he
must
be
on
duty
ten
or
twelve
hours
a
day
.
<EOS>
Poor
fellow
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
deuced
good
thing
for
him
,
and
he
ought
to
be
very
much
obliged
to
me
for
putting
him
in
the
way
of
getting
it
.
<EOS>
But
he
told
me
to
tell
you
that
if
he
did
n't
call
,
you
were
not
to
be
angry
with
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
no
;
 
I
shall
remember
,
of
course
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
if
he
do
n't
work
now
he
must
come
to
grief
.
<EOS>
He
has
n't
got
a
shilling
that
he
can
call
his
own
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Has
n't
he
really
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Not
a
shilling
,
Mrs.
Greenow
;
 
and
then
he
's
awfully
in
debt
.
<EOS>
He
is
n't
a
bad
fellow
,
you
know
,
only
there
's
no
trusting
him
for
anything
.
"
<EOS>
Then
after
a
few
further
inquiries
that
were
almost
tender
,
and
a
promise
of
further
supplies
from
the
dairy
,
Mr.
Cheesacre
took
his
leave
,
almost
forgetting
to
ask
after
Miss
Vavasor
.
  
<EOS>
But
as
he
left
the
house
he
had
a
word
to
say
to
Jeannette
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
has
n't
been
here
,
has
he
,
Jenny
?
"
<EOS>
"
We
have
n't
seen
a
sight
of
him
yet
,
sir
,
 
<EOS>
and
I
have
thought
it
a
little
odd
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Then
Mr.
Cheesacre
gave
the
girl
half
-
a
-
crown
,
and
went
his
way
.
<EOS>
Jeannette
,
I
think
,
must
have
forgotten
that
the
Captain
had
looked
in
after
leaving
his
military
duties
on
the
preceding
evening
.
  
<EOS>
The
Captain
's
ten
or
twelve
hours
of
daily
work
was
performed
,
no
doubt
,
at
irregular
intervals
,
 
some
days
late
and
some
days
early
,
 
for
he
might
be
seen
about
Norwich
almost
at
all
times
,
during
the
early
part
of
that
November
;
 
and
he
might
be
very
often
seen
going
into
the
Close
.
<EOS>
In
Norwich
there
are
two
weekly
market
-
days
,
but
on
those
days
the
Captain
was
no
doubt
kept
more
entirely
to
his
military
employment
,
for
at
such
times
he
never
was
seen
near
the
Close
.
<EOS>
Now
Mr.
Cheesacre
's
visits
to
the
town
were
generally
made
on
market
-
days
,
and
so
it
happened
that
they
did
not
meet
.
<EOS>
On
such
occasions
Mr.
Cheesacre
always
was
driven
to
Mrs.
Greenow
's
door
in
a
cab
,
 
for
he
would
come
into
town
by
railway
,
 
and
he
would
deposit
a
basket
bearing
the
rich
produce
of
his
dairy
.
<EOS>
It
was
in
vain
that
Mrs.
Greenow
protested
against
these
gifts
,
 
for
she
did
protest
and
declared
that
if
they
were
continued
,
they
would
be
sent
back
.
<EOS>
They
were
,
however
,
continued
,
and
Mrs.
Greenow
was
at
her
wits
"
end
about
them
.
<EOS>
Cheesacre
would
not
come
up
with
them
;
but
leaving
them
,
would
go
about
his
business
,
and
would
return
to
see
the
ladies
.
<EOS>
On
such
occasions
he
would
be
very
particular
in
getting
his
basket
from
Jeannette
.
<EOS>
As
he
did
so
he
would
generally
ask
some
question
about
the
Captain
,
and
Jeannette
would
give
him
answers
confidentially
,
 
so
that
there
was
a
strong
friendship
between
these
two
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
am
I
to
do
about
it
?
"
said
Mrs.
Greenow
,
as
Kate
came
into
the
sitting
-
room
one
morning
,
and
saw
on
the
table
a
small
hamper
lined
with
a
clean
cloth
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
as
much
as
Jeannette
has
been
able
to
carry
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
So
it
is
,
ma'am
,
 
quite
;
and
I
'm
strong
in
the
arm
,
too
,
ma'am
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
am
I
to
do
,
Kate
?
<EOS>
He
is
such
a
good
creature
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
he
do
admire
you
both
so
much
,
"
said
Jeannette
.
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
I
do
n't
want
to
offend
him
for
many
reasons
,
"
said
the
aunt
,
looking
knowingly
at
her
niece
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
anything
about
your
reasons
,
aunt
,
but
if
I
were
you
,
I
should
leave
the
basket
just
as
it
is
till
he
comes
in
the
afternoon
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Would
you
mind
seeing
him
yourself
,
Kate
,
and
explaining
to
him
that
it
wo
n't
do
to
get
on
in
this
way
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
you
would
n't
mind
telling
him
that
if
he
'll
promise
not
to
bring
any
more
,
you
wo
n't
object
to
take
this
one
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Indeed
,
aunt
,
I
ca
n't
do
that
.
<EOS>
They
're
not
brought
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Kate
!
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nonsense
,
aunt
;
 
I
wo
n't
have
you
say
so
;
 
before
Jeannette
,
too
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
's
for
both
,
ma'am
;
I
do
indeed
.
<EOS>
And
there
certainly
ai
n't
any
cream
to
be
bought
like
it
in
Norwich
:
 
nor
yet
eggs
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
what
there
is
in
the
basket
.
"
<EOS>
And
the
widow
lifted
up
the
corner
of
the
cloth
.
<EOS>
"
I
declare
if
there
is
n't
a
turkey
poult
already
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
!
"
said
Jeannette
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
turkey
poult
!
<EOS>
Why
,
that
's
worth
ten
and
sixpence
in
the
market
if
it
's
worth
a
penny
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
out
of
the
question
that
I
should
take
upon
myself
to
say
anything
to
him
about
it
,
"
said
Kate
.
  
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
word
I
do
n't
see
why
you
should
n't
,
as
well
as
I
,
"
said
Mrs.
Greenow
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
tell
you
what
,
ma'am
,
"
said
Jeannette
:
"
let
me
just
ask
him
who
they
're
for
;
 
he
'll
tell
me
anything
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
n't
do
anything
of
the
kind
,
Jeannette
,
"
said
Kate
.
<EOS>
"
Of
course
,
aunt
,
they
're
brought
for
you
.
<EOS>
There
's
no
doubt
about
that
.
<EOS>
A
gentleman
does
n't
bring
cream
and
turkeys
to
 
<EOS>
I
've
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
see
why
a
gentleman
should
n't
bring
cream
and
turkeys
to
you
just
as
well
as
to
me
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
he
told
me
once
as
much
himself
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
,
if
they
're
for
me
,
I
'll
leave
them
down
outside
the
front
door
,
and
he
may
find
his
provisions
there
.
"
<EOS>
And
Kate
proceeded
to
lift
the
basket
off
the
table
.
  
<EOS>
"
Leave
it
alone
,
Kate
,
"
said
Mrs.
Greenow
,
with
a
voice
that
was
rather
solemn
;
and
which
had
,
too
,
something
of
sadness
in
its
tone
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Leave
it
alone
.
<EOS>
I
'll
see
Mr.
Cheesacre
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
do
hope
you
wo
n't
mention
my
name
.
<EOS>
It
's
the
most
absurd
thing
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
The
man
never
spoke
two
dozen
words
to
me
in
his
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
speaks
to
me
,
though
,
"
said
Mrs.
Greenow
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
dare
say
he
does
,
"
said
Kate
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
about
you
,
too
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
does
n't
come
here
with
those
big
flowers
in
his
button
-
hole
for
nothing
,
"
said
Jeannette
,
 
"
not
<EOS>
if
I
knows
what
a
gentleman
means
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
he
does
n't
,
"
said
Mrs.
Greenow
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
do
n't
object
,
aunt
,
"
said
Kate
,
"
I
will
write
to
grandpapa
and
tell
him
that
I
will
return
home
at
once
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
!
 
<EOS>
because
of
Mr.
Cheesacre
?
"
said
Mrs.
Greenow
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
you
'll
be
so
silly
as
that
,
my
dear
.
"
  
<EOS>
On
the
present
occasion
Mrs.
Greenow
undertook
that
she
would
see
the
generous
gentleman
,
and
endeavour
to
stop
the
supplies
from
his
farmyard
.
<EOS>
It
was
well
understood
that
he
would
call
about
four
o'clock
,
when
his
business
in
the
town
would
be
over
;
and
that
he
would
bring
with
him
a
little
boy
,
who
would
carry
away
the
basket
.
<EOS>
At
that
hour
Kate
of
course
was
absent
,
and
the
widow
received
Mr.
Cheesacre
alone
.
<EOS>
The
basket
and
cloth
were
there
,
in
the
sitting
-
room
,
and
on
the
table
were
laid
out
the
rich
things
which
it
had
contained
;
 
the
turkey
poult
first
,
on
a
dish
provided
in
the
lodging
-
house
,
then
a
dozen
fresh
eggs
in
a
soup
plate
,
then
the
cream
in
a
little
tin
can
,
which
,
for
the
last
fortnight
,
had
passed
regularly
between
Oileymead
and
the
house
in
the
Close
,
and
as
to
which
Mr.
Cheesacre
was
very
pointed
in
his
inquiries
with
Jeannette
.
<EOS>
Then
behind
the
cream
there
were
two
or
three
heads
of
broccoli
,
and
a
stick
of
celery
as
thick
as
a
man
's
wrist
.
<EOS>
Altogether
the
tribute
was
a
very
comfortable
assistance
to
the
housekeeping
of
a
lady
living
in
a
small
way
in
lodgings
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Cheesacre
,
when
he
saw
the
array
on
the
long
sofa
-
table
,
knew
that
he
was
to
prepare
himself
for
some
resistance
;
but
that
resistance
would
give
him
,
he
thought
,
an
opportunity
of
saying
a
few
words
that
he
was
desirous
of
speaking
,
and
he
did
not
altogether
regret
it
.
<EOS>
"
I
just
called
in
,
"
he
said
,
"
to
see
how
you
were
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
are
not
likely
to
starve
,
"
said
Mrs.
Greenow
,
pointing
to
the
delicacies
from
Oileymead
.
  
<EOS>
"
Just
a
few
trifles
that
my
old
woman
asked
me
to
bring
in
,
"
said
Cheesacre
.
<EOS>
"
She
insisted
on
putting
them
up
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
your
old
woman
is
by
far
too
magnificent
,
"
said
Mrs.
Greenow
.
<EOS>
"
She
really
frightens
Kate
and
me
out
of
our
wits
.
"
  
Mr.
Cheesacre
had
no
wish
that
Miss
Vavasor
's
name
should
be
brought
into
play
upon
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Dear
Mrs.
Greenow
,
"
said
he
,
"
there
is
no
cause
for
you
to
be
alarmed
,
I
can
assure
you
.
<EOS>
Mere
trifles
;
 
light
as
air
<EOS>
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
think
anything
of
such
things
as
these
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
and
Kate
think
a
great
deal
of
them
,
 
a
very
great
deal
,
I
can
assure
you
.
<EOS>
Do
you
know
,
we
had
a
long
debate
this
morning
whether
or
no
we
would
return
them
to
Oileymead
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Return
them
,
Mrs.
Greenow
!
"
  
"
Yes
,
indeed
:
what
are
women
,
situated
as
we
are
,
to
do
under
such
circumstances
?
<EOS>
When
gentlemen
will
be
too
liberal
,
their
liberality
must
be
repressed
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
have
I
been
too
liberal
,
Mrs.
Greenow
?
<EOS>
What
is
a
young
turkey
and
a
stick
of
celery
when
a
man
is
willing
to
give
everything
that
he
has
in
the
world
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
've
got
a
great
deal
more
in
the
world
,
Mr.
Cheesacre
,
than
you
'd
like
to
part
with
.
<EOS>
But
we
wo
n't
talk
of
that
,
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
When
shall
we
talk
of
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
really
have
anything
to
say
,
you
had
by
far
better
speak
to
Kate
herself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Greenow
,
you
mistake
me
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
you
mistake
me
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Just
at
this
moment
,
as
he
was
drawing
close
to
the
widow
,
she
heard
,
or
fancied
that
she
heard
,
Jeannette
's
step
,
and
,
going
to
the
sitting
-
room
door
,
called
to
her
maid
.
<EOS>
Jeannette
did
not
hear
her
,
but
the
bell
was
rung
,
and
then
Jeannette
came
.
<EOS>
"
You
may
take
these
things
down
,
Jeannette
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Cheesacre
has
promised
that
no
more
shall
come
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
have
n't
promised
,
"
said
Mr.
Cheesacre
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
oblige
me
and
Kate
,
I
know
;
 
and
,
Jeannette
,
tell
Miss
Vavasor
that
I
am
ready
to
walk
with
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
Then
Mr.
Cheesacre
knew
that
he
could
not
say
those
few
words
on
that
occasion
;
and
as
the
hour
of
his
train
was
near
,
he
took
his
departure
,
and
went
out
of
the
Close
,
followed
by
the
little
boy
,
carrying
the
basket
,
the
cloth
,
and
the
tin
can
.
   
<EOS>
Which
Shall
It
Be
?
 
<EOS>
The
next
day
was
Sunday
,
and
it
was
well
known
at
the
lodging
-
house
in
the
Close
that
Mr.
Cheesacre
would
not
be
seen
there
then
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Greenow
had
specially
warned
him
that
she
was
not
fond
of
Sunday
visitors
,
fearing
that
otherwise
he
might
find
it
convenient
to
give
them
too
much
of
his
society
on
that
idle
day
.
<EOS>
In
the
morning
the
aunt
and
niece
both
went
to
the
Cathedral
,
and
then
at
three
o'clock
they
dined
.
<EOS>
But
on
this
occasion
they
did
not
dine
alone
.
<EOS>
Charlie
Fairstairs
,
who
,
with
her
family
,
had
come
home
from
Yarmouth
,
had
been
asked
to
join
them
;
and
in
order
that
Charlie
might
not
feel
it
dull
,
Mrs.
Greenow
had
,
with
her
usual
good
-
nature
,
invited
Captain
Bellfield
.
<EOS>
A
very
nice
little
dinner
they
had
.
<EOS>
The
captain
carved
the
turkey
,
giving
due
honour
to
Mr.
Cheesacre
as
he
did
so
;
and
when
he
nibbled
his
celery
with
his
cheese
,
he
was
prettily
jocose
about
the
richness
of
the
farmyard
at
Oileymead
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
the
most
generous
man
I
ever
met
,
"
said
Mrs.
Greenow
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
he
is
,
"
said
Captain
Bellfield
,
"
and
we
'll
drink
his
health
.
<EOS>
Poor
old
Cheesy
!
<EOS>
It
's
a
great
pity
he
should
n't
get
himself
a
wife
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
any
man
more
calculated
to
make
a
young
woman
happy
,
"
said
Mrs.
Greenow
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
indeed
,
"
said
Miss
Fairstairs
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
told
that
his
house
and
all
about
it
is
quite
beautiful
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Especially
the
straw
-
yard
and
the
horse
-
pond
,
"
said
the
Captain
.
<EOS>
And
then
they
drank
the
health
of
their
absent
friend
.
  
<EOS>
It
had
been
arranged
that
the
ladies
should
go
to
church
in
the
evening
,
and
it
was
thought
that
Captain
Bellfield
would
,
perhaps
,
accompany
them
;
but
when
the
time
for
starting
came
,
Kate
and
Charlie
were
ready
,
but
the
widow
was
not
,
and
she
remained
,
 
in
order
,
as
she
afterwards
explained
to
Kate
,
that
Captain
Bellfield
might
not
seem
to
be
turned
out
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
He
had
made
no
offer
churchwards
,
and
,
 
"
Poor
man
,
"
as
Mrs.
Greenow
said
in
her
little
explanation
,
"
if
I
had
n't
let
him
stay
there
,
he
would
have
had
no
resting
-
place
for
the
sole
of
his
foot
,
but
some
horrid
barrack
-
room
!
"
<EOS>
Therefore
the
Captain
was
allowed
to
find
a
resting
-
place
in
Mrs.
Greenow
's
drawing
-
room
;
but
on
the
return
of
the
young
ladies
from
church
,
he
was
not
there
,
and
the
widow
was
alone
,
"
looking
back
,
"
she
said
,
"
to
things
that
were
gone
;
 
that
were
gone
.
<EOS>
But
come
,
dears
<EOS>
,
I
am
not
going
to
make
you
melancholy
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
So
they
had
tea
,
and
Mr.
Cheesacre
's
cream
was
used
with
liberality
.
  
<EOS>
Captain
Bellfield
had
not
allowed
the
opportunity
to
slip
idly
from
his
hands
.
<EOS>
In
the
first
quarter
of
an
hour
after
the
younger
ladies
had
gone
,
he
said
little
or
nothing
,
but
sat
with
a
wine
-
glass
before
him
,
which
once
or
twice
he
filled
from
the
decanter
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
afraid
the
wine
is
not
very
good
,
"
said
Mrs.
Greenow
.
<EOS>
"
But
one
ca
n't
get
good
wine
in
lodgings
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
not
thinking
very
much
about
it
,
Mrs.
Greenow
;
that
's
the
truth
,
"
said
the
Captain
.
<EOS>
"
I
daresay
the
wine
is
very
good
of
its
kind
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Then
there
was
another
period
of
silence
between
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
you
find
it
rather
dull
,
living
in
lodgings
;
do
n't
you
?
"
asked
the
Captain
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
quite
what
you
mean
by
dull
,
Captain
Bellfield
;
but
a
woman
circumstanced
as
I
am
,
ca
n't
find
her
life
very
gay
.
<EOS>
It
's
not
a
full
twelvemonth
yet
since
I
lost
all
that
made
life
desirable
,
and
sometimes
I
wonder
at
myself
for
holding
up
as
well
as
I
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
wicked
to
give
way
to
grief
too
much
,
Mrs.
Greenow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
what
my
dear
Kate
always
says
to
me
,
and
I
'm
sure
I
do
my
best
to
overcome
it
.
<EOS>
"
Upon
this
soft
tears
trickled
down
her
cheek
,
showing
in
their
course
that
she
at
any
rate
used
no
paint
in
producing
that
freshness
of
colour
which
was
one
of
her
great
charms
.
<EOS>
Then
she
pressed
her
handkerchief
to
her
eyes
,
and
removing
it
,
smiled
faintly
on
the
Captain
.
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
intend
to
treat
you
to
such
a
scene
as
this
,
Captain
Bellfield
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
nothing
on
earth
,
Mrs.
Greenow
,
I
desire
so
much
,
as
permission
to
dry
those
tears
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Time
alone
can
do
that
,
Captain
Bellfield
;
 
time
alone
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
can
not
time
be
aided
by
love
and
friendship
and
affection
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
By
friendship
,
yes
.
<EOS>
What
would
life
be
worth
without
the
solace
of
friendship
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
how
much
better
is
the
warm
glow
of
love
?
"
<EOS>
Captain
Bellfield
,
as
he
asked
this
question
,
deliberately
got
up
,
and
moved
his
chair
over
to
the
widow
's
side
.
<EOS>
But
the
widow
as
deliberately
changed
her
position
to
the
corner
of
a
sofa
.
<EOS>
The
Captain
did
not
at
once
follow
her
,
nor
did
he
in
any
way
show
that
he
was
aware
that
she
had
fled
from
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
much
better
is
the
warm
glow
of
love
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
again
,
contenting
himself
with
looking
into
her
face
with
all
his
eyes
.
<EOS>
He
had
hoped
that
he
would
have
been
able
to
press
her
hand
by
this
time
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
warm
,
glow
of
love
,
Captain
Bellfield
,
if
you
have
ever
felt
it
 
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
have
ever
felt
it
!
<EOS>
Do
I
not
feel
it
now
,
Mrs.
Greenow
?
<EOS>
There
can
be
no
longer
any
mask
kept
upon
my
feelings
.
<EOS>
I
never
could
restrain
the
yearnings
of
my
heart
when
they
have
been
strong
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Have
they
often
been
strong
,
Captain
Bellfield
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
;
often
;
 
in
various
scenes
of
life
;
on
the
field
of
battle
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
did
not
know
that
you
had
seen
active
service
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
!
 
not
on
the
plains
of
Zuzuland
,
when
with
fifty
picked
men
I
kept
five
hundred
Caffres
at
bay
for
seven
weeks
;
 
never
knew
the
comfort
of
a
bed
,
or
a
pillow
to
my
head
,
for
seven
long
weeks
!
<EOS>
"
  
"
Not
for
seven
weeks
?
"
said
Mrs.
Greenow
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
.
<EOS>
Did
I
not
see
active
service
at
Essiquebo
,
on
the
burning
coast
of
Guiana
,
when
all
the
wild
Africans
from
the
woods
rose
up
to
destroy
the
colony
;
or
again
at
the
mouth
of
the
Kitchyhomy
River
,
when
I
made
good
the
capture
of
a
slaver
by
my
own
hand
and
my
own
sword
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
really
had
n't
heard
,
"
said
Mrs.
Greenow
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
I
understand
.
<EOS>
I
know
.
<EOS>
Cheesy
is
the
best
fellow
in
the
world
in
some
respects
,
but
he
can
not
bring
himself
to
speak
well
of
a
fellow
behind
his
back
.
<EOS>
I
know
who
has
belittled
me
.
<EOS>
Who
was
the
first
to
storm
the
heights
of
Inkerman
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
the
Captain
,
thinking
in
the
heat
of
the
moment
that
he
might
as
well
be
hung
for
a
sheep
as
a
lamb
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
when
you
spoke
of
yearnings
,
I
thought
you
meant
yearnings
of
a
softer
kind
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
So
I
did
.
<EOS>
So
I
did
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
why
I
have
been
led
away
to
speak
of
deeds
that
are
very
seldom
mentioned
,
at
any
rate
by
myself
.
<EOS>
But
I
can
not
bear
that
a
slanderous
backbiting
tongue
should
make
you
think
that
I
have
seen
no
service
.
<EOS>
I
have
served
her
Majesty
in
the
four
quarters
of
the
globe
,
Mrs.
Greenow
;
and
now
I
am
ready
to
serve
you
in
any
way
in
which
you
will
allow
me
to
make
my
service
acceptable
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Whereupon
he
took
one
stride
over
to
the
sofa
,
and
went
down
upon
his
knees
before
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
Captain
Bellfield
,
I
do
n't
want
any
services
.
<EOS>
Pray
get
up
now
;
the
girl
will
come
in
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
care
nothing
for
any
girl
.
<EOS>
I
am
planted
here
till
some
answer
shall
have
been
made
to
me
;
till
some
word
shall
have
been
said
that
may
give
me
a
little
hope
.
<EOS>
"
Then
he
attempted
to
get
hold
of
her
hand
,
but
she
put
them
behind
her
back
and
shook
her
head
.
<EOS>
"
Arabella
,
"
he
said
,
"
will
you
not
speak
a
word
to
me
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Not
a
word
,
Captain
Bellfield
,
till
you
get
up
;
and
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
have
you
call
me
Arabella
.
<EOS>
I
am
the
widow
of
Samuel
Greenow
,
than
whom
no
man
was
more
respected
where
he
was
known
,
and
it
is
not
fitting
that
I
should
be
addressed
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
want
you
to
become
my
wife
,
 
and
then
 
"
  
"
Ah
,
then
indeed
!
<EOS>
But
that
then
is
n't
likely
to
come
.
<EOS>
Get
up
,
Captain
Bellfield
,
or
I
'll
push
you
over
and
then
ring
the
bell
.
<EOS>
A
man
never
looks
so
much
like
a
fool
as
when
he
's
kneeling
down
,
 
unless
he
's
saying
his
prayers
,
as
you
ought
to
be
doing
now
.
<EOS>
Get
up
,
I
tell
you
.
<EOS>
It
's
just
half
past
seven
,
and
I
told
Jeannette
to
come
to
me
then
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
that
in
the
widow
's
voice
which
made
him
get
up
,
and
he
rose
slowly
to
his
feet
.
<EOS>
"
You
've
pushed
all
the
chairs
about
,
you
stupid
man
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
Then
in
one
minute
she
had
restored
the
scattered
furniture
to
their
proper
places
,
and
had
rung
the
bell
.
<EOS>
When
Jeannette
came
she
desired
that
tea
might
be
ready
by
the
time
that
the
young
ladies
returned
,
and
asked
Captain
Bellfield
if
a
cup
should
be
set
for
him
.
<EOS>
This
he
declined
,
and
bade
her
farewell
while
Jeannette
was
still
in
the
room
.
<EOS>
She
shook
hands
with
him
without
any
sign
of
anger
,
and
even
expressed
a
hope
that
they
might
see
him
again
before
long
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
's
a
very
handsome
man
,
is
the
Captain
,
"
said
Jeannette
,
as
the
hero
of
the
Kitchyhomy
River
descended
the
stairs
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
should
n't
think
about
handsome
men
,
child
,
"
said
Mrs.
Greenow
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
I
'm
sure
I
do
n't
,
"
said
Jeannette
.
<EOS>
"
Not
no
more
than
anybody
else
;
but
if
a
man
is
handsome
,
ma'am
,
why
it
stands
to
reason
that
he
is
handsome
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
Captain
Bellfield
has
given
you
a
kiss
and
a
pair
of
gloves
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
As
for
gloves
and
such
like
,
Mr.
Cheesacre
is
much
better
for
giving
than
the
Captain
;
as
we
all
know
;
do
n't
we
,
ma'am
?
<EOS>
But
in
regard
to
kisses
,
they
're
presents
as
I
never
takes
from
anybody
.
<EOS>
Let
everybody
pay
his
debts
.
<EOS>
If
the
Captain
ever
gets
a
wife
,
let
him
kiss
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
On
the
following
Tuesday
morning
Mr.
Cheesacre
as
usual
called
in
the
Close
,
but
he
brought
with
him
no
basket
.
<EOS>
He
merely
left
a
winter
nosegay
made
of
green
leaves
and
laurestinus
flowers
,
and
sent
up
a
message
to
say
that
he
should
call
at
half
past
three
,
and
hoped
that
he
might
then
be
able
to
see
Mrs.
Greenow
 
on
particular
business
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
means
you
,
Kate
,
"
said
Mrs.
Greenow
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
it
does
n't
;
it
does
n't
mean
me
at
all
.
<EOS>
At
any
rate
he
wo
n't
see
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
dare
say
it
's
me
<EOS>
he
wishes
to
see
.
<EOS>
It
seems
to
be
the
fashionable
plan
now
for
gentlemen
to
make
offers
by
deputy
.
<EOS>
If
he
says
anything
,
I
can
only
refer
him
to
you
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
you
can
;
you
can
tell
him
simply
that
I
wo
n't
have
him
.
<EOS>
But
he
is
no
more
thinking
of
me
than
 
"
  
"
Than
he
is
of
me
,
you
were
going
to
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
No
,
aunt
;
I
was
n't
going
to
say
that
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
we
shall
see
.
<EOS>
If
he
does
mean
anything
,
of
course
you
can
please
yourself
;
but
I
really
think
you
might
do
worse
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
if
I
do
n't
want
to
do
at
all
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
well
;
you
must
have
your
own
way
.
<EOS>
I
can
only
tell
you
what
I
think
.
"
  
<EOS>
At
half
past
three
o'clock
punctually
Mr.
Cheesacre
came
to
the
door
,
and
was
shown
up
-
stairs
.
<EOS>
He
was
told
by
Jeannette
that
Captain
Bellfield
had
looked
in
on
the
Sunday
afternoon
,
but
that
Miss
Fairstairs
and
Miss
Vavasor
had
been
there
the
whole
time
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
got
on
his
black
boots
nor
yet
had
his
round
topped
hat
.
<EOS>
And
as
he
did
wear
a
new
frock
coat
,
and
had
his
left
hand
thrust
into
a
kid
glove
,
Jeannette
was
quite
sure
that
he
intended
business
of
some
kind
.
<EOS>
With
new
boots
,
creaking
loudly
,
he
walked
up
into
the
drawing
-
room
,
and
there
he
found
the
widow
alone
.
  
<EOS>
"
Thanks
for
the
flowers
<EOS>
,
"
she
said
at
once
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
so
good
of
you
to
bring
something
that
we
could
accept
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
As
for
that
,
"
said
he
,
"
I
do
n't
see
why
you
should
scruple
about
a
trifle
of
cream
,
but
I
hope
that
any
such
feeling
as
that
will
be
over
before
long
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
To
this
the
widow
made
no
answer
,
but
she
looked
very
sweetly
on
him
as
she
bade
him
sit
down
.
  
<EOS>
He
did
sit
down
;
but
first
he
put
his
hat
and
stick
carefully
away
in
one
corner
,
and
then
he
pulled
off
his
glove
 
somewhat
laboriously
,
for
his
hand
was
warm
.
<EOS>
He
was
clearly
prepared
for
great
things
.
<EOS>
As
he
pushed
up
his
hair
with
his
hands
there
came
from
his
locks
an
ambrosial
perfume
,
 
as
of
marrow
-
oil
,
and
there
was
a
fixed
propriety
of
position
of
every
hair
of
his
whiskers
,
which
indicated
very
plainly
that
he
had
been
at
a
hairdresser
's
shop
since
he
left
the
market
.
<EOS>
Nor
do
I
believe
that
he
had
worn
that
coat
when
he
came
to
the
door
earlier
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
If
I
were
to
say
that
he
had
called
at
his
tailor
's
also
,
I
do
not
think
that
I
should
be
wrong
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
goes
everything
at
Oileymead
?
"
said
Mrs.
Greenow
,
seeing
that
her
guest
wanted
some
little
assistance
in
leading
off
the
conversation
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pretty
well
,
Mrs.
Greenow
;
pretty
well
.
<EOS>
Everything
will
go
very
well
if
I
am
successful
in
the
object
which
I
have
on
hand
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
sure
I
hope
you
'll
be
successful
in
all
your
undertakings
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
In
all
my
business
undertakings
I
am
,
Mrs.
Greenow
.
<EOS>
There
is
n't
a
shilling
due
on
my
land
to
e'er
a
bank
in
Norwich
;
and
I
have
n't
thrashed
out
a
quarter
of
last
year
's
corn
yet
,
which
is
more
than
many
of
them
can
say
.
<EOS>
But
there
ai
n't
many
of
them
who
do
n't
have
to
pay
rent
,
and
<EOS>
so
perhaps
I
ought
n't
to
boast
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
that
Providence
has
been
very
good
to
you
,
Mr.
Cheesacre
,
as
regards
worldly
matters
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
I
have
n't
left
it
all
to
Providence
,
either
.
<EOS>
Those
who
do
,
generally
go
to
the
wall
,
as
far
as
I
can
see
.
<EOS>
I
'm
always
at
work
late
and
early
,
and
I
know
when
I
get
a
profit
out
of
a
man
's
labour
<EOS>
and
when
I
do
n't
,
as
well
as
though
it
was
my
only
chance
of
bread
and
cheese
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
always
thought
you
understood
farming
business
,
Mr.
Cheesacre
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
do
.
<EOS>
I
like
a
bit
of
fun
<EOS>
well
enough
,
when
the
time
for
it
comes
,
as
you
saw
at
Yarmouth
.
<EOS>
And
I
keep
my
three
or
four
hunters
,
as
I
think
a
country
gentleman
should
;
and
I
shoot
over
my
own
ground
.
<EOS>
But
I
always
stick
to
my
work
.
<EOS>
There
are
men
,
like
Bellfield
,
who
wo
n't
work
.
<EOS>
What
do
they
come
to
?
<EOS>
They
're
always
borrowing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
he
has
fought
his
country
's
battles
,
Mr.
Cheesacre
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
fight
!
<EOS>
I
suppose
he
's
been
telling
you
some
of
his
old
stories
.
<EOS>
He
was
ten
years
in
the
West
Indies
,
and
all
his
fighting
was
with
the
mosquitoes
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
he
was
in
the
Crimea
.
<EOS>
At
Inkerman
,
for
instance
 
"
  
"
He
in
the
Crimea
!
<EOS>
Well
,
never
mind
.
<EOS>
But
do
you
inquire
before
you
believe
that
story
.
<EOS>
But
as
I
was
saying
,
Mrs.
Greenow
,
you
have
seen
my
little
place
at
Oileymead
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
charming
house
.
<EOS>
All
you
want
is
a
mistress
for
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
it
;
that
's
just
it
.
<EOS>
All
I
want
is
a
mistress
for
it
.
<EOS>
And
there
's
only
one
woman
on
earth
that
I
would
wish
to
see
in
that
position
.
<EOS>
Arabella
Greenow
,
will
you
be
that
woman
?
"
<EOS>
As
he
made
the
offer
he
got
up
and
stood
before
her
,
placing
his
right
hand
upon
his
heart
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
,
Mr.
Cheesacre
!
"
she
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
you
.
<EOS>
Who
else
?
<EOS>
Since
I
saw
you
what
other
woman
has
been
anything
to
me
;
or
,
indeed
,
I
may
say
before
?
<EOS>
Since
the
first
day
I
saw
you
<EOS>
I
felt
that
there
my
happiness
depended
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Mr.
Cheesacre
,
I
thought
you
were
looking
elsewhere
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
no
.
<EOS>
There
never
was
such
a
mistake
as
that
.
<EOS>
I
have
the
highest
regard
and
esteem
for
Miss
Vavasor
,
but
really
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
Mr.
Cheesacre
,
what
am
I
to
say
to
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
are
you
to
say
to
me
?
<EOS>
Say
that
you
'll
be
mine
.
<EOS>
Say
that
I
shall
be
yours
.
<EOS>
Say
that
all
I
have
at
Oileymead
shall
be
yours
.
<EOS>
Say
that
the
open
carriage
for
a
pair
of
ponies
to
be
driven
by
a
lady
which
I
have
been
looking
at
this
morning
shall
be
yours
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
indeed
;
the
sweetest
thing
you
ever
saw
in
your
life
,
 
just
like
one
that
the
lady
of
the
Lord
Lieutenant
drives
about
in
always
.
<EOS>
That
's
what
you
must
say
.
<EOS>
Come
,
Mrs.
Greenow
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
Mr.
Cheesacre
,
you
do
n't
know
what
it
is
to
have
buried
the
pride
of
your
youth
hardly
yet
twelve
months
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
have
buried
him
,
and
there
let
there
be
an
end
of
it
.
<EOS>
Your
sitting
here
all
alone
,
morning
,
noon
,
and
night
,
wo
n't
bring
him
back
.
<EOS>
I
'm
sorry
for
him
;
I
am
indeed
.
<EOS>
Poor
Greenow
!
<EOS>
But
what
more
can
I
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
do
more
,
Mr.
Cheesacre
.
<EOS>
I
can
mourn
for
him
in
solitude
and
in
silence
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
no
.
<EOS>
What
's
the
use
of
it
,
 
breaking
your
heart
for
nothing
,
 
and
my
heart
too
.
<EOS>
You
never
think
of
that
.
"
<EOS>
And
Mr.
Cheesacre
spoke
in
a
tone
that
was
full
of
reproach
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
can
not
be
,
Mr.
Cheesacre
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
,
but
it
can
be
.
<EOS>
Come
,
Mrs.
Greenow
.
<EOS>
We
understand
each
other
well
enough
now
,
surely
.
<EOS>
Come
,
dearest
.
"
<EOS>
And
he
approached
her
as
though
to
put
his
arm
round
her
waist
.
<EOS>
But
at
that
moment
there
came
a
knock
at
the
door
,
and
Jeannette
,
entering
the
room
,
told
her
mistress
that
Captain
Bellfield
was
below
and
wanted
to
know
whether
he
could
see
her
for
a
minute
on
particular
business
.
  
<EOS>
"
Show
Captain
Bellfield
up
,
certainly
,
"
said
Mrs.
Greenow
.
  
<EOS>
"
D
 
---
Captain
Bellfield

"
said
Mr.
Cheesacre
.
   
<EOS>
Alice
Is
Taught
to
Grow
Upwards
,
Towards
the
Light
.
 
<EOS>
Before
the
day
came
on
which
Alice
was
to
go
to
Matching
Priory
,
she
had
often
regretted
that
she
had
been
induced
to
make
the
promise
,
and
yet
she
had
as
often
resolved
that
there
was
no
possible
reason
why
she
should
not
go
to
Matching
Priory
.
<EOS>
But
she
feared
this
commencement
of
a
closer
connection
with
her
great
relations
.
<EOS>
She
had
told
herself
so
often
that
she
was
quite
separated
from
them
,
that
the
slight
accident
of
blood
in
no
way
tied
her
to
them
or
them
to
her
,
 
<EOS>
this
lesson
had
been
so
thoroughly
taught
to
her
by
the
injudicious
attempts
of
Lady
Macleod
to
teach
an
opposite
lesson
,
that
she
did
not
like
the
idea
of
putting
aside
the
effect
of
that
teaching
.
<EOS>
And
perhaps
she
was
a
little
afraid
of
the
great
folk
whom
she
might
probably
meet
at
her
cousin
's
house
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
herself
she
had
liked
,
 
and
had
loved
too
with
that
momentary
love
which
certain
circumstances
of
our
life
will
sometimes
produce
,
a
love
which
is
strong
while
it
lasts
,
but
which
can
be
laid
down
when
the
need
of
it
is
passed
.
<EOS>
She
had
liked
and
loved
Lady
Glencora
,
and
had
in
no
degree
been
afraid
of
her
during
those
strange
visitings
in
Queen
Anne
Street
;
 
but
she
was
by
no
means
sure
that
she
should
like
Lady
Glencora
in
the
midst
of
her
grandeur
and
surrounded
by
the
pomp
of
her
rank
.
<EOS>
She
would
have
no
other
friend
or
acquaintance
in
that
house
,
and
feared
that
she
might
find
herself
desolate
,
cold
,
and
wounded
in
her
pride
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
tricked
into
the
visit
,
too
,
or
rather
had
tricked
herself
into
it
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
sure
that
there
had
been
a
joint
scheme
between
her
cousin
and
Lady
Midlothian
,
and
could
not
resist
the
temptation
of
repudiating
it
in
her
letter
to
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
But
there
had
been
no
such
scheme
;
she
had
wronged
Lady
Glencora
,
and
had
therefore
been
unable
to
resist
her
second
request
.
<EOS>
But
she
felt
unhappy
,
fearing
that
she
would
be
out
of
her
element
,
and
more
than
once
half
made
up
her
mind
to
excuse
herself
.
  
<EOS>
Her
aunt
had
,
from
the
first
,
thought
well
of
her
going
,
believing
that
it
might
probably
be
the
means
of
reconciling
her
to
Mr.
Grey
.
<EOS>
Moreover
,
it
was
a
step
altogether
in
the
right
direction
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
would
,
if
she
lived
,
become
a
Duchess
,
and
as
she
was
decidedly
Alice
's
cousin
,
of
course
Alice
should
go
to
her
house
when
invited
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
acknowledged
that
Lady
Macleod
was
not
selfish
in
her
worship
of
rank
.
<EOS>
She
had
played
out
her
game
in
life
,
and
there
was
no
probability
that
she
would
live
to
be
called
cousin
by
a
Duchess
of
Omnium
.
<EOS>
She
bade
<EOS>
Alice
go
to
Matching
Priory
,
simply
because
she
loved
her
niece
,
and
therefore
wished
her
to
live
in
the
best
and
most
eligible
way
within
her
reach
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
owe
it
as
a
duty
to
your
family
to
go
,
"
said
Lady
Macleod
.
  
<EOS>
What
further
correspondence
about
her
affairs
had
passed
between
Lady
Macleod
and
Lady
Midlothian
Alice
never
knew
.
<EOS>
She
steadily
refused
all
entreaty
made
that
she
would
answer
the
Countess
's
letter
,
and
at
last
threatened
her
aunt
that
if
the
request
were
further
urged
she
would
answer
it
,
 
telling
Lady
Midlothian
that
she
had
been
very
impertinent
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
becoming
a
very
old
woman
,
Alice
,
"
the
poor
lady
said
,
piteously
,
"
<EOS>
and
I
suppose
I
had
better
not
interfere
any
further
.
<EOS>
Whatever
I
have
said
I
have
always
meant
to
be
for
your
good
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Then
Alice
got
up
,
and
kissing
her
aunt
,
tried
to
explain
to
her
that
she
resented
no
interference
from
her
,
and
felt
grateful
for
all
that
she
both
said
and
did
;
but
that
she
could
not
endure
meddling
from
people
whom
she
did
not
know
,
and
who
thought
themselves
entitled
to
meddle
by
their
rank
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
because
they
are
cousins
as
well
,
"
said
Lady
Macleod
,
in
a
softly
sad
,
apologetic
voice
.
  
<EOS>
Alice
left
Cheltenham
about
the
middle
of
November
on
her
road
to
Matching
Priory
.
<EOS>
She
was
to
sleep
in
London
one
night
,
and
go
down
to
Matching
in
Yorkshire
with
her
maid
on
the
following
day
.
<EOS>
Her
father
undertook
to
meet
her
at
the
Great
Western
Station
,
and
to
take
her
on
the
following
morning
to
the
Great
Northern
.
<EOS>
He
said
nothing
in
his
letter
about
dining
with
her
,
but
when
he
met
her
,
muttered
something
about
an
engagement
,
and
taking
her
home
graciously
promised
that
he
would
breakfast
with
her
on
the
following
morning
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
very
glad
you
are
going
,
Alice
,
"
he
said
when
they
were
in
the
cab
together
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
papa
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
?
 
<EOS>
because
I
think
it
's
the
proper
thing
to
do
.
<EOS>
You
know
I
've
never
said
much
to
you
about
these
people
.
<EOS>
They
're
not
connected
with
me
,
and
I
know
that
they
hate
the
name
of
Vavasor
;
 
not
but
what
the
name
is
a
deal
older
than
any
of
theirs
,
and
the
family
too
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
therefore
I
do
n't
understand
why
you
think
I
'm
specially
right
.
<EOS>
If
you
were
to
say
I
was
specially
wrong
,
I
should
be
less
surprised
,
and
of
course
I
should
n't
go
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
should
go
by
all
means
.
<EOS>
Rank
and
wealth
are
advantages
,
let
anybody
say
what
they
will
to
the
contrary
.
<EOS>
Why
else
does
everybody
want
to
get
them
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
sha
n't
get
them
by
going
to
Matching
Priory
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
'll
get
part
of
their
value
.
<EOS>
Take
them
as
a
whole
,
the
nobility
of
England
are
pleasant
acquaintances
to
have
.
<EOS>
I
have
n't
run
after
them
very
much
myself
,
though
I
married
,
as
I
may
say
,
among
them
.
<EOS>
That
very
thing
rather
stood
in
my
way
than
otherwise
.
<EOS>
But
you
may
be
sure
of
this
,
that
men
and
women
ought
to
grow
,
like
plants
,
upwards
.
<EOS>
Everybody
should
endeavour
to
stand
as
well
as
he
can
in
the
world
,
and
if
I
had
a
choice
of
acquaintance
between
a
sugar
-
baker
and
a
peer
,
I
should
prefer
the
peer
,
 
unless
,
indeed
,
the
sugar
-
baker
had
something
very
strong
on
his
side
to
offer
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
call
that
tuft
-
hunting
,
and
it
does
not
necessitate
toadying
.
<EOS>
It
's
simply
growing
up
,
towards
the
light
,
as
the
trees
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Alice
listened
to
her
father
's
worldly
wisdom
with
a
smile
,
but
she
did
not
attempt
to
answer
him
.
<EOS>
It
was
very
seldom
,
indeed
,
that
he
took
upon
himself
the
labour
of
lecturing
her
,
or
that
he
gave
her
even
as
much
counsel
as
he
had
given
now
.
"
<EOS>
Well
,
papa
,
I
hope
I
shall
find
myself
growing
towards
the
light
,
"
she
said
as
she
got
out
of
the
cab
.
<EOS>
Then
he
had
not
entered
the
house
,
but
had
taken
the
cab
on
with
him
to
his
club
.
  
<EOS>
On
her
table
Alice
found
a
note
from
her
cousin
George
.
<EOS>
"
I
hear
you
are
going
down
to
the
Pallisers
at
Matching
Priory
to
-
morrow
,
and
as
I
shall
be
glad
to
say
one
word
to
you
<EOS>
before
you
go
,
will
you
let
me
see
you
this
evening
,
 
say
at
nine
?
 
<EOS>
G.
V.
<EOS>
"
She
felt
immediately
that
she
could
not
help
seeing
him
,
but
she
greatly
regretted
the
necessity
.
<EOS>
She
wished
that
she
had
gone
directly
from
Cheltenham
to
the
North
,
 
regardless
even
of
those
changes
of
wardrobe
which
her
purposed
visit
required
.
<EOS>
Then
she
set
herself
to
considering
.
<EOS>
How
had
George
heard
of
her
visit
to
the
Priory
,
and
how
had
he
learned
the
precise
evening
which
she
would
pass
in
London
?
<EOS>
Why
should
he
be
so
intent
on
watching
all
her
movements
as
it
seemed
that
he
was
?
<EOS>
As
to
seeing
him
she
had
no
alternative
,
so
she
completed
her
arrangements
for
her
journey
before
nine
,
and
then
awaited
him
in
the
drawing
-
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
so
glad
you
're
going
to
Matching
Priory
,
"
were
the
first
words
he
said
.
<EOS>
He
,
too
,
might
have
taught
her
to
grow
towards
the
light
,
if
she
had
asked
him
for
his
reasons
;
 
but
this
she
did
not
do
just
then
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
did
you
learn
that
I
was
going
?
<EOS>
"
she
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
heard
it
from
a
friend
of
mine
.
<EOS>
Well
;
 
from
Burgo
Fitzgerald
,
if
you
must
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
From
Mr.
Fitzgerald
?
<EOS>
"
said
Alice
,
in
profound
astonishment
:
"
How
could
Mr.
Fitzgerald
have
heard
of
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
more
than
I
know
,
Alice
.
<EOS>
Not
directly
from
Lady
Glencora
,
I
should
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
That
would
be
impossible
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
quite
so
,
no
doubt
.
<EOS>
I
think
she
keeps
up
her
intimacy
with
Burgo
's
sister
,
and
perhaps
it
got
round
to
him
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
did
he
tell
you
also
that
I
was
going
to
-
morrow
?
<EOS>
He
must
have
known
all
about
it
very
accurately
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
then
I
asked
Kate
,
and
Kate
told
me
when
you
were
going
.
<EOS>
Yes
;
I
know
.
<EOS>
Kate
has
been
wrong
,
has
n't
she
?
<EOS>
Kate
was
cautioned
,
no
doubt
,
to
say
nothing
about
your
comings
and
goings
to
so
inconsiderable
a
person
as
myself
.
<EOS>
But
you
must
not
be
down
upon
Kate
.
<EOS>
She
never
mentioned
it
till
I
showed
by
my
question
to
her
that
I
knew
all
about
your
journey
to
Matching
.
<EOS>
I
own
<EOS>
I
do
not
understand
why
it
should
be
necessary
to
keep
me
so
much
in
the
dark
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Alice
felt
that
she
was
blushing
.
<EOS>
The
caution
had
been
given
to
Kate
because
Kate
still
transgressed
in
her
letters
,
by
saying
little
words
about
her
brother
.
<EOS>
And
Alice
did
not
even
now
believe
Kate
to
have
been
false
to
her
;
but
she
saw
that
she
herself
had
been
imprudent
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
understand
it
,
"
continued
George
,
speaking
without
looking
at
her
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
It
was
but
the
other
day
that
we
were
such
dear
friends
!
<EOS>
Do
you
remember
the
balcony
at
Basle
?
<EOS>
and
now
it
seems
that
we
are
quite
estranged
;
 
nay
,
worse
than
estranged
;
that
I
am
,
as
it
were
,
under
some
ban
.
<EOS>
Have
I
done
anything
to
offend
you
,
Alice
?
<EOS>
If
so
,
speak
out
,
like
a
woman
of
spirit
as
you
are
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nothing
,
"
said
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
why
am
I
tabooed
?
<EOS>
Why
was
I
told
the
other
day
that
I
might
not
congratulate
you
on
your
happy
emancipation
?
<EOS>
I
say
boldly
,
that
had
you
resolved
on
that
while
we
were
together
in
Switzerland
,
you
would
have
permitted
me
,
as
a
friend
,
almost
as
a
brother
,
to
discuss
it
with
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
not
,
George
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
you
would
.
<EOS>
And
why
has
Kate
been
warned
not
to
tell
me
of
this
visit
to
the
Pallisers
?
<EOS>
I
know
she
has
been
warned
though
she
has
not
confessed
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Alice
sat
silent
,
not
knowing
what
to
say
in
answer
to
this
charge
brought
against
her
,
 
thinking
,
perhaps
,
that
the
questioner
would
allow
his
question
to
pass
without
an
answer
.
<EOS>
But
Vavasor
was
not
so
complaisant
.
<EOS>
"
If
there
be
any
reason
,
Alice
,
I
think
that
I
have
a
right
to
ask
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
For
a
few
seconds
she
did
not
speak
a
word
,
but
sat
considering
.
<EOS>
He
also
remained
silent
with
his
eyes
fixed
upon
her
.
<EOS>
She
looked
at
him
and
saw
nothing
but
his
scar
,
 
nothing
but
his
scar
and
the
brightness
of
his
eyes
,
which
was
almost
fierce
.
<EOS>
She
knew
that
he
was
in
earnest
,
and
therefore
resolved
that
she
would
be
in
earnest
also
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
that
you
have
such
a
right
,
"
she
said
at
last
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
let
me
exercise
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
that
you
have
such
a
right
,
but
I
think
also
that
you
are
ungenerous
to
exercise
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
understand
that
.
<EOS>
By
heavens
,
Alice
,
I
can
not
be
left
in
this
suspense
!
<EOS>
If
I
have
done
anything
to
offend
you
,
perhaps
I
can
remove
the
offence
by
apology
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
done
nothing
to
offend
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Or
if
there
be
any
cause
why
our
friendship
should
be
dropped
,
 
why
we
should
be
on
a
different
footing
to
each
other
in
London
than
we
were
in
Switzerland
<EOS>
,
I
may
acknowledge
it
,
if
it
be
explained
to
me
.
<EOS>
But
I
can
not
put
up
with
the
doubt
,
when
I
am
told
that
I
have
a
right
to
demand
its
solution
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
I
will
be
frank
with
you
,
George
,
though
my
being
so
will
,
as
you
may
guess
,
be
very
painful
.
"
<EOS>
She
paused
again
,
looking
at
him
to
see
if
yet
he
would
spare
her
;
but
he
was
all
scar
and
eyes
as
before
,
and
there
was
no
mercy
in
his
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
Your
sister
,
George
,
has
thought
that
my
parting
with
Mr.
Grey
might
lead
to
a
renewal
of
a
purpose
of
marriage
between
you
and
me
.
<EOS>
You
know
her
eagerness
,
and
will
understand
that
it
may
have
been
necessary
that
I
should
require
silence
from
her
on
that
head
.
<EOS>
You
ought
now
to
understand
it
all
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
then
am
being
punished
for
her
sins
,
"
he
said
;
and
suddenly
the
scar
on
his
face
was
healed
up
again
,
and
there
was
something
of
the
old
pleasantness
in
his
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
said
nothing
about
any
sins
,
George
,
but
I
have
found
it
necessary
to
be
on
my
guard
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
he
said
,
after
a
short
pause
,
"
You
are
an
honest
woman
,
Alice
,
 
the
honestest
I
ever
knew
.
<EOS>
I
will
bring
Kate
to
order
,
 
and
,
now
,
we
may
be
friends
again
;
may
we
not
?
"
<EOS>
And
he
extended
his
hand
to
her
across
the
table
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
she
said
,
"
certainly
,
if
you
wish
it
.
"
<EOS>
She
spoke
doubtingly
,
with
indecision
in
her
voice
,
as
though
remembering
at
the
moment
that
he
had
given
her
no
pledge
.
<EOS>
"
I
certainly
do
wish
it
very
much
,
"
said
he
;
and
then
she
gave
him
her
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
may
now
talk
about
your
new
freedom
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
she
;
"
no
.
<EOS>
Do
not
speak
of
that
.
<EOS>
A
woman
does
not
do
what
I
have
done
in
that
affair
without
great
suffering
.
<EOS>
I
have
to
think
of
it
daily
;
but
do
not
make
me
speak
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
this
other
subject
,
this
visit
to
Matching
;
surely
I
may
speak
of
that
?
<EOS>
"
There
was
something
now
in
his
voice
so
bright
,
that
she
felt
the
influence
of
it
,
and
answered
him
cheerfully
,
"
I
do
n't
see
what
you
can
have
to
say
about
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
have
a
great
deal
.
<EOS>
I
am
so
glad
you
are
going
.
<EOS>
Mind
you
cement
a
close
intimacy
with
Mr.
Palliser
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
With
Mr.
Palliser
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Yes
;
with
Mr.
Palliser
.
<EOS>
You
must
read
all
the
blue
books
about
finance
.
<EOS>
I
'll
send
them
to
you
if
you
like
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
George
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
quite
in
earnest
.
<EOS>
That
is
,
not
in
earnest
about
the
blue
books
,
as
you
would
not
have
time
;
but
about
Mr.
Palliser
.
<EOS>
He
will
be
the
new
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
without
a
doubt
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Will
he
indeed
?
<EOS>
But
why
should
I
make
a
bosom
friend
of
the
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
want
any
public
money
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
do
,
my
girl
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
see
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
I
do
n't
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
shall
get
returned
at
this
next
election
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
sure
I
hope
you
will
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
if
I
do
,
of
course
it
will
be
my
game
to
support
the
ministry
;
 
or
rather
the
new
ministry
;
for
of
course
there
will
be
changes
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
they
will
be
on
the
right
side
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
a
doubt
of
that
,
Alice
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
they
might
be
changed
altogether
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
that
's
impossible
.
<EOS>
It
's
very
well
as
a
dream
;
but
there
are
no
such
men
as
you
want
to
see
,
 
men
really
from
the
people
,
 
strong
enough
to
take
high
office
.
<EOS>
A
man
ca
n't
drive
four
horses
because
he
's
a
philanthropist
,
 
or
rather
a
philhorseophist
,
and
is
desirous
that
the
team
should
be
driven
without
any
hurt
to
them
.
<EOS>
A
man
ca
n't
govern
well
,
simply
because
he
is
genuinely
anxious
that
men
should
be
well
governed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
will
there
never
be
any
such
men
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wo
n't
say
that
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
mind
confessing
to
you
that
it
is
my
ambition
to
be
such
a
one
myself
.
<EOS>
But
a
child
must
crawl
before
he
can
walk
.
<EOS>
Such
a
one
as
I
,
hoping
to
do
something
in
politics
,
must
spare
no
chance
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
something
to
me
that
Mr.
Palliser
should
become
the
friend
of
any
dear
friend
of
mine
,
 
especially
of
a
dear
friend
bearing
the
same
name
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
afraid
,
George
,
you
'll
find
me
a
bad
hand
at
making
any
such
friendship
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
say
he
is
led
immensely
by
his
wife
,
and
that
she
is
very
clever
.
<EOS>
But
I
mean
this
chiefly
,
Alice
,
<EOS>
that
I
do
hope
I
shall
have
all
your
sympathy
in
any
political
career
that
I
may
make
,
and
all
your
assistance
also
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
sympathy
I
think
I
can
promise
you
.
<EOS>
My
assistance
,
I
fear
,
would
be
worthless
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
By
no
means
worthless
,
Alice
;
not
if
I
see
you
take
that
place
in
the
world
which
I
hope
to
see
you
fill
.
<EOS>
Do
you
think
women
nowadays
have
no
bearing
upon
the
politics
of
the
times
?
<EOS>
Almost
as
much
as
men
have
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
In
answer
to
which
Alice
shook
her
head
;
but
,
nevertheless
,
she
felt
in
some
way
pleased
and
flattered
.
  
<EOS>
George
left
her
without
saying
a
word
more
about
her
marriage
prospects
past
or
future
,
and
Alice
as
she
went
to
bed
felt
glad
that
this
explanation
between
them
had
been
made
.
   
<EOS>
Dandy
and
Flirt
.
 
<EOS>
Alice
reached
the
Matching
Road
Station
about
three
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
without
adventure
,
and
immediately
on
the
stopping
of
the
train
became
aware
that
all
trouble
was
off
her
own
hands
.
<EOS>
A
servant
in
livery
came
to
the
open
window
,
and
touching
his
hat
to
her
,
inquired
if
she
were
Miss
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
Then
her
dressing
-
bag
and
shawls
and
cloaks
were
taken
from
her
,
and
she
was
conveyed
through
the
station
by
the
station
-
master
on
one
side
of
her
,
the
footman
on
the
other
,
and
by
the
railway
porter
behind
.
<EOS>
She
instantly
perceived
that
she
had
become
possessed
of
great
privileges
by
belonging
even
for
a
time
to
Matching
Priory
,
and
that
she
was
essentially
growing
upwards
towards
the
light
.
  
<EOS>
Outside
,
on
the
broad
drive
before
the
little
station
,
she
saw
an
omnibus
that
was
going
to
the
small
town
of
Matching
,
intended
for
people
who
had
not
grown
upwards
as
had
been
her
lot
;
and
she
saw
also
a
light
stylish
-
looking
cart
which
she
would
have
called
a
Whitechapel
<EOS>
had
she
been
properly
instructed
in
such
matters
,
and
a
little
low
open
carriage
with
two
beautiful
small
horses
,
in
which
was
sitting
a
lady
enveloped
in
furs
.
<EOS>
Of
course
this
was
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
Another
servant
was
standing
on
the
ground
,
holding
the
horses
of
the
carriage
and
the
cart
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
Alice
,
I
'm
so
glad
you
've
come
,
"
said
a
voice
from
the
furs
.
<EOS>
"
Look
here
,
dear
;
your
maid
can
go
in
the
dog
-
cart
with
your
things
,
"
 
it
was
n't
a
dog
-
cart
,
but
Lady
Glencora
knew
no
better
;
 
"
she
'll
be
quite
comfortable
there
;
and
do
you
get
in
here
.
<EOS>
Are
you
very
cold
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
no
;
not
cold
at
all
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
it
is
awfully
cold
.
<EOS>
You
've
been
in
the
stuffy
carriage
,
but
you
'll
find
it
cold
enough
out
here
,
I
can
tell
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
Lady
Glencora
,
I
am
so
sorry
that
I
've
brought
you
out
on
such
a
morning
,
"
said
Alice
,
getting
in
and
taking
the
place
<EOS>
assigned
her
next
to
the
charioteer
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
nonsense
!
<EOS>
Sorry
!
<EOS>
Why
I
've
looked
forward
to
meeting
you
all
alone
,
ever
since
I
knew
you
were
coming
.
<EOS>
If
it
had
snowed
all
the
morning
I
should
have
come
just
the
same
.
<EOS>
I
drive
out
almost
every
day
when
I
'm
down
here
,
 
<EOS>
that
is
,
when
the
house
is
not
too
crowded
,
or
I
can
make
an
excuse
.
<EOS>
Wrap
these
things
over
you
;
there
are
plenty
of
them
.
<EOS>
You
shall
drive
if
you
like
.
<EOS>
"
Alice
,
however
,
declined
the
driving
,
expressing
her
gratitude
in
what
prettiest
words
she
could
find
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
like
driving
better
than
anything
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
does
n't
like
ladies
to
hunt
,
and
of
course
it
would
n't
do
as
he
does
not
hunt
himself
.
<EOS>
I
do
ride
,
but
he
never
gets
on
horseback
.
<EOS>
I
almost
fancy
I
should
like
to
drive
four
-
in
-
hand
,
 
<EOS>
only
I
know
I
should
be
afraid
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
would
look
very
terrible
,
"
said
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
would
n't
it
?
<EOS>
The
look
would
be
the
worst
of
it
;
as
it
is
all
the
world
over
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
I
wish
there
were
no
such
things
as
looks
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
mean
anything
improper
,
you
know
;
only
one
does
get
so
hampered
,
right
and
left
,
for
fear
of
Mrs.
Grundy
.
<EOS>
I
endeavour
to
go
straight
,
and
get
along
pretty
well
on
the
whole
,
I
suppose
.
<EOS>
Baker
,
you
must
put
Dandy
in
the
bar
;
he
pulls
so
,
going
home
,
that
I
ca
n't
hold
him
in
the
check
.
"
<EOS>
She
stopped
the
horses
,
and
Baker
,
a
very
completely
-
got
-
up
groom
of
some
forty
years
of
age
,
who
sat
behind
,
got
down
and
put
the
impetuous
Dandy
"
in
the
bar
,
"
thereby
changing
the
rein
,
so
that
the
curb
was
brought
to
bear
on
him
.
<EOS>
"
They
're
called
Dandy
and
Flirt
,
"
continued
Lady
Glencora
,
speaking
to
Alice
.
"
<EOS>
Ai
n't
they
a
beautiful
match
?
<EOS>
The
Duke
gave
them
to
me
and
named
them
himself
.
<EOS>
Did
you
ever
see
the
Duke
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Never
,
"
said
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
wo
n't
be
here
before
Christmas
,
but
you
shall
be
introduced
some
day
in
London
.
<EOS>
He
's
an
excellent
creature
and
I
'm
a
great
pet
of
his
;
though
,
after
all
,
I
never
speak
half
a
dozen
words
to
him
when
I
see
him
.
<EOS>
He
's
one
of
those
people
who
never
talk
.
<EOS>
I
'm
one
of
those
who
like
talking
,
as
you
'll
find
out
.
<EOS>
I
think
it
runs
in
families
;
and
the
Pallisers
are
non
-
talkers
.
<EOS>
That
does
n't
mean
that
they
are
not
speakers
,
for
Mr.
Palliser
has
plenty
to
say
in
the
House
,
and
they
declare
that
he
's
one
of
the
few
public
men
who
've
got
lungs
enough
to
make
a
financial
statement
without
breaking
down
.
"
  
<EOS>
Alice
was
aware
that
she
had
as
yet
hardly
spoken
herself
,
and
began
to
bethink
herself
that
she
did
n't
know
what
to
say
.
<EOS>
Had
Lady
Glencora
paused
on
the
subject
of
Dandy
and
Flirt
,
she
might
have
managed
to
be
enthusiastic
about
the
horses
,
but
she
could
not
discuss
freely
the
general
silence
of
the
Palliser
family
,
nor
the
excellent
lungs
,
as
regarded
public
purposes
,
of
the
one
who
was
the
husband
of
her
present
friend
.
<EOS>
So
she
asked
how
far
it
was
to
Matching
Priory
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
're
not
tired
of
me
already
,
I
hope
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
mean
that
,
"
said
Alice
.
<EOS>
"
I
delight
in
the
drive
.
<EOS>
But
somehow
one
expects
Matching
Station
to
be
near
Matching
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
yes
;
that
's
a
great
cheat
.
<EOS>
It
's
not
Matching
Station
at
all
but
Matching
Road
Station
,
and
it
's
eight
miles
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
great
bore
,
for
though
the
omnibus
brings
our
parcels
,
we
have
to
be
constantly
sending
over
,
and
it
's
very
expensive
,
I
can
assure
you
.
<EOS>
I
want
Mr.
Palliser
to
have
a
branch
,
but
he
says
he
would
have
to
take
all
the
shares
himself
,
and
that
would
cost
more
,
I
suppose
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Is
there
a
town
at
Matching
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
a
little
bit
of
a
place
.
<EOS>
I
'll
go
round
by
it
if
you
like
,
and
in
at
the
further
gate
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
no
!
"
said
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
,
but
I
should
like
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
borough
once
,
and
belonged
to
the
Duke
;
but
they
put
it
out
at
the
Reform
Bill
.
<EOS>
They
made
some
kind
of
bargain
;
 
he
was
to
keep
either
Silverbridge
or
Matching
,
but
not
both
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
sits
for
Silverbridge
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
The
Duke
chose
Silverbridge
,
 
or
rather
his
father
did
,
as
he
was
then
going
to
build
his
great
place
in
Barsetshire
;
 
that
's
near
Silverbridge
.
<EOS>
But
the
Matching
people
have
n't
forgiven
him
yet
.
<EOS>
He
was
sitting
for
Matching
himself
when
the
Reform
Bill
passed
.
<EOS>
Then
his
father
died
,
and
he
has
n't
lived
there
much
since
.
<EOS>
It
's
a
great
deal
nicer
place
than
Gatherum
Castle
,
only
not
half
so
grand
.
<EOS>
I
hate
grandeur
;
do
n't
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
tried
much
of
it
,
as
you
have
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Come
now
;
that
's
not
fair
.
<EOS>
There
's
no
one
in
the
world
less
grand
than
I
am
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
mean
that
I
've
not
had
grand
people
about
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Having
cut
all
your
cousins
,
 
and
Lady
Midlothian
in
particular
,
like
a
naughty
girl
as
you
are
.
<EOS>
I
was
so
angry
with
you
when
you
accused
me
of
selling
you
about
that
.
<EOS>
You
ought
to
have
known
that
I
was
the
last
person
in
the
world
to
have
done
such
a
thing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
not
think
you
meant
to
sell
me
,
but
I
thought
 
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
you
did
,
Alice
.
<EOS>
I
know
what
you
thought
;
you
thought
that
Lady
Midlothian
was
making
a
tool
of
me
that
I
might
bring
you
under
her
thumb
,
so
that
she
might
bully
you
into
Mr.
Grey
's
arms
.
<EOS>
That
's
what
you
thought
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
that
I
was
at
all
entitled
to
your
good
opinion
,
but
I
was
not
entitled
to
that
special
bad
opinion
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
had
no
bad
opinion
;
 
but
it
was
so
necessary
that
I
should
guard
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
shall
be
guarded
.
<EOS>
I
'll
take
you
under
my
shield
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Grey
sha
n't
be
named
to
you
,
except
that
I
shall
expect
you
to
tell
me
all
about
it
;
and
you
must
tell
me
all
about
that
dangerous
cousin
,
too
,
of
whom
they
were
saying
such
terrible
things
down
in
Scotland
.
<EOS>
I
had
heard
of
him
before
.
"
<EOS>
These
last
words
Lady
Glencora
spoke
in
a
lower
voice
and
in
an
altered
tone
,
 
slowly
,
as
though
she
were
thinking
of
something
that
pained
her
.
<EOS>
It
was
from
Burgo
Fitzgerald
that
she
had
heard
of
George
Vavasor
.
  
<EOS>
Alice
did
not
know
what
to
say
.
<EOS>
She
found
it
impossible
to
discuss
all
the
most
secret
and
deepest
of
her
feelings
out
in
that
open
carriage
,
perhaps
in
the
hearing
of
the
servant
behind
,
on
this
her
first
meeting
with
her
cousin
,
 
of
whom
,
in
fact
,
she
knew
very
little
.
<EOS>
She
had
not
intended
to
discuss
these
things
at
all
,
and
certainly
not
in
such
a
manner
as
this
.
<EOS>
So
she
remained
silent
.
<EOS>
"
This
is
the
beginning
of
the
park
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
,
pointing
to
a
grand
old
ruin
of
an
oak
tree
,
which
stood
on
the
wide
margin
of
the
road
,
outside
the
rounded
corner
of
the
park
palings
,
propped
up
with
a
skeleton
of
supporting
sticks
all
round
it
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
that
is
Matching
oak
,
under
which
Coeur
de
Lion
or
Edward
the
Third
<EOS>
,
I
forget
which
,
was
met
by
Sir
Guy
de
Palisere
as
he
came
from
the
war
,
or
from
hunting
,
or
something
of
that
kind
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
king
,
you
know
,
who
had
been
fighting
or
whatever
it
was
,
and
Sir
Guy
entertained
him
when
he
was
very
tired
.
<EOS>
Jeffrey
Palliser
,
who
is
my
husband
's
cousin
,
says
that
old
Sir
Guy
luckily
pulled
out
his
brandy
-
flask
.
<EOS>
But
the
king
immediately
gave
him
all
the
lands
of
Matching
,
 
only
there
was
a
priory
then
and
a
lot
of
monks
,
and
I
do
n't
quite
understand
how
that
was
.
<EOS>
But
I
know
one
of
the
younger
brothers
always
used
to
be
abbot
and
sit
in
the
House
of
Lords
.
<EOS>
And
the
king
gave
him
Littlebury
at
the
same
time
,
which
is
about
seven
miles
away
from
here
.
<EOS>
As
Jeffrey
Palliser
says
,
it
was
a
great
deal
of
money
for
a
pull
at
his
flask
.
<EOS>
Jeffrey
Palliser
is
here
now
,
and
I
hope
you
'll
like
him
.
<EOS>
If
I
have
no
child
,
and
Mr.
Palliser
were
not
to
marry
again
,
Jeffrey
would
be
the
heir
.
"
<EOS>
And
here
again
her
voice
was
low
and
slow
,
and
altogether
changed
in
its
tone
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
that
's
the
way
most
of
the
old
families
got
their
estates
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Either
so
,
or
by
robbery
.
<EOS>
Many
of
them
were
terrible
thieves
,
my
dear
,
and
I
dare
say
Sir
Guy
was
no
better
than
he
should
be
.
<EOS>
But
since
that
they
have
always
called
some
of
the
Pallisers
Plantagenet
.
<EOS>
My
husband
's
name
is
Plantagenet
.
<EOS>
The
Duke
is
called
George
Plantagenet
,
and
the
king
was
his
godfather
.
<EOS>
The
queen
is
my
godmother
,
I
believe
,
but
I
do
n't
know
that
I
'm
much
the
better
for
it
.
<EOS>
There
's
no
use
in
godfathers
and
godmothers
;
 
do
you
think
there
is
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
much
as
it
's
managed
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
had
a
child
,
 
Oh
,
Alice
,
it
's
a
dreadful
thing
not
to
have
a
child
when
so
much
depends
on
it
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
're
such
a
short
time
married
yet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
well
;
I
can
see
it
in
his
eyes
when
he
asks
me
questions
;
but
I
do
n't
think
he
'd
say
an
unkind
word
,
not
if
his
own
position
depended
on
it
.
<EOS>
Ah
,
well
;
this
is
Matching
.
<EOS>
That
other
gate
we
passed
,
where
Dandy
wanted
to
turn
in
,
 
<EOS>
that
's
where
we
usually
go
up
,
but
I
've
brought
you
round
to
show
you
the
town
.
<EOS>
That
's
the
inn
,
 
whoever
can
possibly
come
to
stay
there
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
;
I
never
saw
anybody
go
in
or
out
.
<EOS>
That
's
the
baker
who
bakes
our
bread
,
 
we
baked
it
at
the
house
at
first
,
but
nobody
could
eat
it
;
and
I
know
that
that
man
there
mends
Mr.
Palliser
's
shoes
.
<EOS>
He
's
very
particular
about
his
shoes
.
<EOS>
We
shall
see
the
church
as
we
go
in
at
the
other
gate
.
<EOS>
It
is
in
the
park
,
and
is
very
pretty
,
 
but
not
half
so
pretty
as
the
priory
ruins
close
to
the
house
.
<EOS>
The
ruins
are
our
great
lion
.
<EOS>
I
do
so
love
to
wander
about
them
at
moonlight
.
<EOS>
I
often
think
of
you
when
I
do
;
I
do
n't
know
why
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
do
know
why
,
and
I
'll
tell
you
some
day
.
<EOS>
Come
,
Miss
Flirt
!
"
  
<EOS>
As
they
drove
up
through
the
park
,
Lady
Glencora
pointed
out
first
the
church
<EOS>
and
then
the
ruins
,
through
the
midst
of
which
the
road
ran
,
<EOS>
and
then
they
were
at
once
before
the
front
door
.
<EOS>
The
corner
of
the
modern
house
came
within
two
hundred
yards
of
the
gateway
of
the
old
priory
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
large
building
,
very
pretty
,
with
two
long
fronts
;
but
it
was
no
more
than
a
house
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
a
palace
,
nor
a
castle
,
nor
was
it
hardly
to
be
called
a
mansion
.
<EOS>
It
was
built
with
gabled
roofs
,
four
of
which
formed
the
side
from
which
the
windows
of
the
drawing
-
rooms
opened
out
upon
a
lawn
which
separated
the
house
from
the
old
ruins
,
and
which
indeed
surrounded
the
ruins
,
and
went
inside
them
,
forming
the
present
flooring
of
the
old
chapel
,
and
the
old
refectory
,
and
the
old
cloisters
.
<EOS>
Much
of
the
cloisters
indeed
was
standing
,
and
there
the
stone
pavement
remained
;
but
the
square
of
the
cloisters
was
all
turfed
,
and
in
the
middle
of
it
stood
a
large
modern
stone
vase
,
out
of
the
broad
basin
of
which
hung
flowering
creepers
and
green
tendrils
.
  
<EOS>
As
Lady
Glencora
drove
up
to
the
door
,
a
gentleman
,
who
had
heard
the
sound
of
the
wheels
,
came
forth
to
meet
them
.
<EOS>
"
There
's
Mr.
Palliser
,
"
said
she
;
"
that
shows
that
you
are
an
honoured
guest
,
for
you
may
be
sure
that
he
is
hard
at
work
and
would
not
have
come
out
for
anybody
else
.
<EOS>
Plantagenet
,
here
is
Miss
Vavasor
,
perished
.
<EOS>
Alice
,
my
husband
.
"
<EOS>
Then
Mr.
Palliser
put
forth
his
hand
and
helped
her
out
of
the
carriage
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
've
not
found
it
very
cold
,
"
said
he
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
winter
has
come
upon
us
quite
suddenly
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
said
nothing
more
to
her
than
this
,
till
he
met
her
again
before
dinner
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
tall
thin
man
,
apparently
not
more
than
thirty
years
of
age
,
looking
in
all
respects
like
a
gentleman
,
but
with
nothing
in
his
appearance
that
was
remarkable
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
face
that
you
might
see
and
forget
,
and
see
again
and
forget
again
;
and
yet
when
you
looked
at
it
and
pulled
it
to
pieces
,
you
found
that
it
was
a
fairly
good
face
,
showing
intellect
in
the
forehead
,
and
much
character
in
the
mouth
.
<EOS>
The
eyes
too
,
though
not
to
be
called
bright
,
had
always
something
to
say
for
themselves
,
looking
as
though
they
had
a
real
meaning
.
<EOS>
But
the
outline
of
the
face
was
almost
insignificant
,
being
too
thin
;
and
he
wore
no
beard
to
give
it
character
.
<EOS>
But
,
indeed
,
Mr.
Palliser
was
a
man
who
had
never
thought
of
assisting
his
position
in
the
world
by
his
outward
appearance
.
<EOS>
Not
to
be
looked
at
,
but
to
be
read
about
in
the
newspapers
,
was
his
ambition
.
<EOS>
Men
said
that
he
was
to
be
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
,
and
no
one
thought
of
suggesting
that
the
insignificance
of
his
face
would
stand
in
his
way
.
  
<EOS>
"
Are
the
people
all
out
?
"
<EOS>
his
wife
asked
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
men
have
not
come
in
from
shooting
;
 
at
least
I
think
not
;
 
and
some
of
the
ladies
are
driving
,
I
suppose
.
<EOS>
But
I
have
n't
seen
anybody
since
you
went
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
you
have
n't
.
<EOS>
He
never
has
time
,
Alice
,
to
see
any
one
.
<EOS>
But
we
'll
go
up
-
stairs
,
dear
.
<EOS>
I
told
them
to
let
us
have
tea
in
my
dressing
-
room
,
as
I
thought
you
'd
like
that
better
than
going
into
the
drawing
-
room
before
you
had
taken
off
your
things
.
<EOS>
You
must
be
famished
,
I
know
.
<EOS>
Then
you
can
come
down
,
or
if
you
want
to
avoid
two
dressings
you
can
sit
over
the
fire
up
-
stairs
till
dinner
-
time
.
"
<EOS>
So
saying
she
skipped
up
-
stairs
and
Alice
followed
her
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Here
's
my
dressing
-
room
,
and
here
's
your
room
all
but
opposite
.
<EOS>
You
look
out
into
the
park
.
<EOS>
It
's
pretty
,
is
n't
it
?
<EOS>
But
come
into
my
dressing
-
room
,
and
see
the
ruins
out
of
the
window
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Alice
followed
Lady
Glencora
across
the
passage
into
what
she
called
her
dressing
-
room
,
and
there
found
herself
surrounded
by
an
infinitude
of
feminine
luxuries
.
<EOS>
The
prettiest
of
tables
were
there
;
 
the
easiest
of
chairs
;
 
the
most
costly
of
cabinets
;
 
the
quaintest
of
old
china
ornaments
.
<EOS>
It
was
bright
with
the
gayest
colours
,
 
made
pleasant
to
the
eye
with
the
binding
of
many
books
,
having
nymphs
painted
on
the
ceiling
and
little
Cupids
on
the
doors
.
<EOS>
"
Is
n't
it
pretty
?
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
turning
quickly
on
Alice
.
<EOS>
"
I
call
it
my
dressing
-
room
because
in
that
way
I
can
keep
people
out
of
it
,
but
I
have
my
brushes
and
soap
in
a
little
closet
there
,
and
my
clothes
,
 
my
clothes
are
everywhere
<EOS>
I
suppose
,
only
there
are
none
of
them
here
.
<EOS>
Is
n't
it
pretty
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
pretty
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
Duke
did
it
all
.
<EOS>
He
understands
such
things
thoroughly
.
<EOS>
Now
to
Mr.
Palliser
a
dressing
-
room
is
a
dressing
-
room
,
and
a
bedroom
a
bedroom
.
<EOS>
He
cares
for
nothing
being
pretty
;
not
even
his
wife
,
or
he
would
n't
have
married
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
would
n't
say
that
if
you
meant
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
do
n't
know
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
when
I
look
at
myself
,
when
I
simply
am
myself
,
with
no
making
up
or
grimacing
,
you
know
,
I
think
I
'm
the
ugliest
young
woman
the
sun
ever
shone
on
.
<EOS>
And
in
ten
years
"
time
I
shall
be
the
ugliest
old
woman
.
<EOS>
Only
think
,
 
my
hair
is
beginning
to
get
grey
,
and
I
'm
not
twenty
-
one
yet
.
<EOS>
Look
at
it
;
"
and
she
lifted
up
the
wavy
locks
just
above
her
ear
.
"
<EOS>
But
there
's
one
comfort
;
he
does
n't
care
about
beauty
.
<EOS>
How
old
are
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Over
five
-
and
-
twenty
,
"
said
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nonsense
;
 
<EOS>
then
I
ought
n't
to
have
asked
you
.
<EOS>
I
am
so
sorry
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
nonsense
at
any
rate
.
<EOS>
Why
should
you
think
I
should
be
ashamed
of
my
age
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
why
,
only
somehow
,
people
are
;
and
I
did
n't
think
you
were
so
old
.
<EOS>
Five
-
and
-
twenty
seems
so
old
to
me
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
nothing
if
you
were
married
;
only
,
you
see
,
you
wo
n't
get
married
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
I
may
yet
;
some
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
you
will
.
<EOS>
You
'll
have
to
give
way
.
<EOS>
You
'll
find
that
they
'll
get
the
better
of
you
.
<EOS>
Your
father
will
storm
at
you
,
and
Lady
Macleod
will
preach
at
you
,
and
Lady
Midlothian
will
jump
upon
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
not
a
bit
afraid
of
Lady
Midlothian
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
what
it
is
,
my
dear
,
to
be
jumped
upon
.
<EOS>
We
talked
with
such
horror
of
the
French
people
giving
their
daughters
in
marriage
,
just
as
they
might
sell
a
house
or
a
field
,
but
we
do
exactly
the
same
thing
ourselves
.
<EOS>
When
they
all
come
upon
you
in
earnest
<EOS>
how
are
you
to
stand
against
them
?
<EOS>
How
can
any
girl
do
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
shall
be
able
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
To
be
sure
you
're
older
,
 
and
you
are
not
so
heavily
weighted
.
<EOS>
But
never
mind
;
I
did
n't
mean
to
talk
about
that
;
 
not
yet
at
any
rate
.
<EOS>
Well
,
now
,
my
dear
,
I
must
go
down
.
<EOS>
The
Duchess
of
St.
Bungay
is
here
,
and
Mr.
Palliser
will
be
angry
if
I
do
n't
do
pretty
to
her
.
<EOS>
The
Duke
is
to
be
the
new
President
of
the
Council
,
or
rather
<EOS>
,
I
believe
he
is
President
now
.
<EOS>
I
try
to
remember
it
all
,
but
it
is
so
hard
when
one
does
n't
really
care
two
pence
how
it
goes
.
<EOS>
Not
but
what
I
'm
very
anxious
that
Mr.
Palliser
should
be
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
.
<EOS>
And
now
,
will
you
remain
here
,
or
will
you
come
down
with
me
,
or
will
you
go
to
your
own
room
,
and
I
'll
call
for
you
when
I
go
down
to
dinner
?
<EOS>
We
dine
at
eight
.
"
  
<EOS>
Alice
decided
that
she
would
stay
in
her
own
room
till
dinner
time
,
and
was
taken
there
by
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
She
found
her
maid
unpacking
her
clothes
,
and
for
a
while
employed
herself
in
assisting
at
the
work
;
but
that
was
soon
done
,
and
then
she
was
left
alone
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
feel
so
strange
,
ma'am
,
among
all
those
people
down
-
stairs
,
"
said
the
girl
.
<EOS>
"
They
all
seem
to
look
at
me
as
though
they
did
n't
know
who
I
was
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
'll
get
over
that
soon
,
Jane
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
I
shall
;
but
you
see
,
they
're
all
like
knowing
each
other
,
miss
.
"
  
<EOS>
Alice
,
when
she
sat
down
alone
,
felt
herself
to
be
very
much
in
the
same
condition
as
her
maid
.
<EOS>
What
would
the
Duchess
of
St.
Bungay
or
Mr.
Jeffrey
Palliser
,
 
who
himself
might
live
to
be
a
duke
if
things
went
well
for
him
,
 
care
for
her
?
<EOS>
As
to
Mr.
Palliser
,
the
master
of
the
house
,
it
was
already
evident
to
her
that
he
would
not
put
himself
out
of
his
way
for
her
.
<EOS>
Had
she
not
done
wrong
to
come
there
?
<EOS>
If
it
were
possible
for
her
to
fly
away
,
back
to
the
dullness
of
Queen
Anne
Street
,
or
even
to
the
preachings
of
Lady
Macleod
,
would
she
not
do
so
immediately
?
<EOS>
What
business
had
she
<EOS>
,
 
she
asked
herself
,
 
to
come
to
such
a
house
as
that
?
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
was
very
kind
to
her
,
but
frightened
her
even
by
her
kindness
.
<EOS>
Moreover
,
she
was
aware
that
Lady
Glencora
could
not
devote
herself
especially
to
any
such
guest
as
she
was
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
must
of
course
look
after
her
duchesses
,
and
do
pretty
,
as
she
called
it
,
to
her
husband
's
important
political
alliances
.
  
<EOS>
And
then
she
began
to
think
about
Lady
Glencora
herself
.
<EOS>
What
a
strange
,
weird
nature
she
was
,
 
with
her
round
blue
eyes
and
wavy
hair
,
looking
sometimes
like
a
child
and
sometimes
almost
like
an
old
woman
!
<EOS>
And
how
she
talked
!
<EOS>
What
things
she
said
,
and
what
terrible
forebodings
she
uttered
of
stranger
things
that
she
meant
to
say
!
<EOS>
Why
had
she
at
their
first
meeting
made
that
allusion
to
the
mode
of
her
own
betrothal
,
 
and
then
,
checking
herself
for
speaking
of
it
<EOS>
so
soon
,
almost
declare
that
she
meant
to
speak
more
of
it
hereafter
?
<EOS>
"
She
should
never
mention
it
to
any
one
,
"
said
Alice
to
herself
.
<EOS>
"
If
her
lot
in
life
has
not
satisfied
her
,
there
is
so
much
the
more
reason
why
she
should
not
mention
it
.
"
<EOS>
Then
Alice
protested
to
herself
that
no
father
,
no
aunt
,
no
Lady
Midlothian
should
persuade
her
into
a
marriage
of
which
she
feared
the
consequences
.
<EOS>
But
Lady
Glencora
had
made
for
herself
excuses
which
were
not
altogether
untrue
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
very
young
,
and
had
been
terribly
weighted
with
her
wealth
.
  
<EOS>
And
it
seemed
to
Alice
that
her
cousin
had
told
her
everything
in
that
hour
and
a
half
that
they
had
been
together
.
<EOS>
She
had
given
a
whole
history
of
her
husband
and
of
herself
.
<EOS>
She
had
said
how
indifferent
he
was
to
her
pleasures
,
and
how
vainly
she
strove
to
interest
herself
in
his
pursuits
.
<EOS>
And
then
,
as
yet
,
she
was
childless
and
without
prospect
of
a
child
,
when
,
as
she
herself
had
said
,
 
"
so
much
depended
on
it
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
very
strange
to
Alice
that
all
this
should
have
been
already
told
to
her
.
<EOS>
And
why
should
Lady
Glencora
think
of
Alice
when
she
walked
out
among
the
priory
ruins
by
moonlight
?
  
<EOS>
The
two
hours
seemed
to
her
very
long
,
 
as
though
she
were
passing
her
time
in
absolute
seclusion
at
Matching
.
<EOS>
Of
course
she
did
not
dare
to
go
down
-
stairs
.
<EOS>
But
at
last
her
maid
came
to
dress
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
get
on
below
,
Jane
?
"
<EOS>
her
mistress
asked
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
miss
,
they
are
uncommon
civil
,
and
I
do
n't
think
after
all
it
will
be
so
bad
.
<EOS>
We
had
our
teas
very
comfortable
in
the
housekeeper
's
room
.
<EOS>
There
are
five
or
six
of
us
altogether
,
all
ladies"-maids
,
miss
;
and
there
's
nothing
on
earth
to
do
all
the
day
long
,
only
sit
and
do
a
little
needlework
over
the
fire
.
"
  
<EOS>
A
few
minutes
before
eight
Lady
Glencora
knocked
at
Alice
's
door
,
and
took
her
arm
to
lead
her
to
the
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
Alice
saw
that
she
was
magnificently
dressed
,
with
an
enormous
expanse
of
robe
,
and
that
her
locks
had
been
so
managed
that
no
one
could
suspect
the
presence
of
a
grey
hair
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
with
all
her
magnificence
,
she
looked
almost
a
child
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Let
me
see
,
"
she
said
,
as
they
went
down
-
stairs
together
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
tell
Jeffrey
to
take
you
in
to
dinner
.
<EOS>
He
's
about
the
easiest
young
man
we
have
here
.
<EOS>
He
rather
turns
up
his
nose
at
everything
,
but
that
does
n't
make
him
the
less
agreeable
;
does
it
,
dear
?
 
unless
he
turns
up
his
nose
at
you
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
perhaps
he
will
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
he
wo
n't
do
that
.
<EOS>
That
would
be
uncourteous
,
 
and
he
's
the
most
courteous
man
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
There
's
nobody
here
,
you
see
,
"
she
said
as
they
entered
the
room
,
"
and
I
did
n't
suppose
there
would
be
.
<EOS>
It
's
always
proper
to
be
first
in
one
's
own
house
.
<EOS>
I
do
so
try
to
be
proper
,
 
and
it
is
such
trouble
.
<EOS>
Talking
of
people
earning
their
bread
,
Alice
;
 
I
'm
sure
I
earn
mine
.
<EOS>
Oh
dear
!
 
<EOS>
what
fun
it
would
be
to
be
sitting
somewhere
in
Asia
,
eating
a
chicken
with
one
's
fingers
,
and
lighting
a
big
fire
outside
one
's
tent
to
keep
off
the
lions
and
tigers
.
<EOS>
Fancy
your
being
on
one
side
of
the
fire
and
the
lions
and
tigers
on
the
other
,
grinning
at
you
through
the
flames
!
"
<EOS>
Then
Lady
Glencora
strove
to
look
like
a
lion
,
and
grinned
at
herself
in
the
glass
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
sort
of
grin
would
n't
frighten
me
,
"
said
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
dare
say
not
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
reading
about
it
in
that
woman
's
travels
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
here
they
are
,
and
I
must
n't
make
any
more
faces
.
<EOS>
Duchess
,
do
come
to
the
fire
.
<EOS>
I
hope
you
've
got
warm
again
.
<EOS>
This
is
my
cousin
,
Miss
Vavasor
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
Duchess
made
a
stiff
little
bow
of
condescension
,
and
then
declared
that
she
was
charmingly
warm
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
how
you
manage
in
your
house
,
but
the
staircases
are
so
comfortable
.
<EOS>
Now
at
Longroyston
we
've
taken
all
the
trouble
in
the
world
,
 
put
down
hot
-
water
pipes
all
over
the
house
,
and
everything
else
that
could
be
thought
of
,
and
yet
,
you
ca
n't
move
about
the
place
without
meeting
with
draughts
at
every
corner
of
the
passages
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
Duchess
spoke
with
an
enormous
emphasis
on
every
other
word
,
sometimes
putting
so
great
a
stress
on
some
special
syllable
,
as
almost
to
bring
her
voice
to
a
whistle
.
<EOS>
This
she
had
done
with
the
word
"
pipes
"
to
a
great
degree
,
 
so
that
Alice
never
afterwards
forgot
the
hot
-
water
pipes
of
Longroyston
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
telling
Lady
Glencora
,
Miss
Palliser
,
that
I
never
knew
a
house
so
warm
as
this
,
 
or
,
I
'm
sorry
to
say
,
"
 
and
here
the
emphasis
was
very
strong
on
the
word
<EOS>
sorry
,
 
"
so
cold
as
Longroyston
.
"
<EOS>
And
the
tone
in
which
Longroyston
was
uttered
would
almost
have
drawn
tears
from
a
critical
audience
in
the
pit
of
a
playhouse
.
<EOS>
The
Duchess
was
a
woman
of
about
forty
,
very
handsome
,
but
with
no
meaning
in
her
beauty
,
carrying
a
good
fixed
colour
in
her
face
,
which
did
not
look
like
paint
,
but
which
probably
had
received
some
little
assistance
from
art
.
<EOS>
She
was
a
well
-
built
,
sizeable
woman
,
with
good
proportions
and
fine
health
,
 
but
a
fool
.
<EOS>
She
had
addressed
herself
to
one
Miss
Palliser
;
but
two
Miss
Pallisers
,
cousins
of
Plantagenet
Palliser
,
had
entered
the
room
at
the
same
time
,
of
whom
I
may
say
,
whatever
other
traits
of
character
they
may
have
possessed
,
that
at
any
rate
they
were
not
fools
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
always
easy
to
warm
a
small
house
like
this
,
"
said
Miss
Palliser
,
whose
Christian
names
,
unfortunately
for
her
,
were
Iphigenia
Theodata
,
and
who
by
her
cousin
and
sister
was
called
Iphy
 
"
<EOS>
and
I
suppose
equally
difficult
to
warm
a
large
one
such
as
Longroyston
.
<EOS>
"
The
other
Miss
Palliser
had
been
christened
Euphemia
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
've
got
no
pipes
,
Duchess
,
at
any
rate
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
;
and
Alice
,
as
she
sat
listening
,
thought
she
discerned
in
Lady
Glencora
's
pronunciation
of
the
word
pipes
an
almost
hidden
imitation
of
the
Duchess
's
whistle
.
<EOS>
It
must
have
been
so
,
for
at
the
moment
Lady
Glencora
's
eye
met
Alice
's
for
an
instant
,
and
was
then
withdrawn
,
so
that
Alice
was
compelled
to
think
that
her
friend
and
cousin
was
not
always
quite
successful
in
those
struggles
she
made
to
be
proper
.
  
<EOS>
Then
the
gentlemen
came
in
one
after
another
,
and
other
ladies
,
till
about
thirty
people
were
assembled
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
came
up
and
spoke
another
word
to
Alice
in
a
kind
voice
,
 
meant
to
express
some
sense
of
connection
if
not
cousinship
.
<EOS>
"
My
wife
has
been
thinking
so
much
of
your
coming
.
<EOS>
I
hope
we
shall
be
able
to
amuse
you
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Alice
,
who
had
already
begun
to
feel
desolate
,
was
grateful
,
and
made
up
her
mind
that
she
would
try
to
like
Mr.
Palliser
.
  
<EOS>
Jeffrey
Palliser
was
almost
the
last
in
the
room
,
but
directly
he
entered
Lady
Glencora
got
up
from
her
seat
,
and
met
him
as
he
was
coming
into
the
crowd
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
take
my
cousin
,
Alice
Vavasor
,
in
to
dinner
,
"
she
said
,
"
and
;
 
will
you
oblige
me
to
-
day
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Yes
;
 
as
you
ask
me
like
that
.
"
  
"
Then
try
to
make
her
comfortable
.
"
<EOS>
After
that
she
introduced
them
,
and
Jeffrey
Palliser
stood
opposite
to
Alice
,
talking
to
her
,
till
dinner
was
announced
.
   
<EOS>
Dinner
at
Matching
Priory
.
 
<EOS>
Alice
found
herself
seated
near
to
Lady
Glencora
's
end
of
the
table
,
and
,
in
spite
of
her
resolution
to
like
Mr.
Palliser
,
she
was
not
sorry
that
such
an
arrangement
had
been
made
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
had
taken
the
Duchess
out
to
dinner
,
and
Alice
wished
to
be
as
far
removed
as
possible
from
her
Grace
.
<EOS>
She
found
herself
seated
between
her
bespoken
friend
Jeffrey
Palliser
and
the
Duke
,
and
as
soon
as
she
was
seated
Lady
Glencora
introduced
her
to
her
second
neighbour
.
<EOS>
"
My
cousin
,
Duke
,
"
Lady
Glencora
said
,
"
and
a
terrible
Radical
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
indeed
;
I
'm
glad
of
that
.
<EOS>
We
're
sadly
in
want
of
a
few
leading
Radicals
,
and
perhaps
I
may
be
able
to
gain
one
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Alice
thought
of
her
cousin
George
,
and
wished
that
he
,
instead
of
herself
,
was
sitting
next
to
the
Duke
of
St.
Bungay
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
'm
afraid
I
never
shall
be
a
leading
Radical
,
"
she
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
shall
lead
me
at
any
rate
,
if
you
will
,
"
said
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
As
the
little
dogs
lead
the
blind
men
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
Lady
Glencora
,
not
so
.
<EOS>
But
as
the
pretty
women
lead
the
men
who
have
eyes
in
their
head
.
<EOS>
There
is
nothing
I
want
so
much
,
Miss
Vavasor
,
as
to
become
a
Radical
;
 
if
I
only
knew
how
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
's
very
easy
to
know
how
,
"
said
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
?
<EOS>
I
do
n't
.
<EOS>
I
've
voted
for
every
liberal
measure
that
has
come
seriously
before
Parliament
since
I
had
a
seat
in
either
House
,
and
I
've
not
been
able
to
get
beyond
Whiggery
yet
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Have
you
voted
for
the
ballot
?
"
asked
Alice
,
almost
trembling
at
her
own
audacity
as
she
put
the
question
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
;
no
,
I
've
not
.
<EOS>
And
I
suppose
that
is
the
crux
.
<EOS>
But
the
ballot
has
never
been
seriously
brought
before
any
House
in
which
I
have
sat
.
<EOS>
I
hate
it
with
so
keen
a
private
hatred
,
that
I
doubt
whether
I
could
vote
for
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
the
Radicals
love
it
,
"
said
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
Palliser
,
"
said
the
Duke
,
speaking
loudly
from
his
end
of
the
table
,
"
I
'm
told
you
can
never
be
entitled
to
call
yourself
a
Radical
till
you
've
voted
for
the
ballot
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
want
to
be
called
a
Radical
,
"
said
Mr.
Palliser
,
 
"
or
to
be
called
anything
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Except
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
in
a
low
voice
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
that
's
about
the
finest
ambition
by
which
a
man
can
be
moved
,
"
said
the
Duke
.
<EOS>
"
The
man
who
can
manage
the
purse
-
strings
of
this
country
can
manage
anything
.
"
<EOS>
Then
that
conversation
dropped
and
the
Duke
ate
his
dinner
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
especially
commissioned
to
amuse
you
,
"
said
Mr.
Jeffrey
Palliser
to
Alice
.
<EOS>
"
But
when
I
undertook
the
task
I
had
no
conception
that
you
would
be
calling
Cabinet
Ministers
over
the
coals
about
their
politics
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
nothing
of
the
kind
,
surely
,
Mr.
Palliser
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
all
Radicals
do
vote
for
the
ballot
,
and
that
's
why
I
said
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Your
definition
was
perfectly
just
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
,
only
 
"
  
"
Only
what
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Lady
Glencora
need
not
have
been
so
anxious
to
provide
specially
for
your
amusement
.
<EOS>
Not
but
what
I
'm
very
much
obliged
to
her
,
 
of
course
.
<EOS>
But
Miss
Vavasor
,
unfortunately
I
'm
not
a
politician
.
<EOS>
I
have
n't
a
chance
of
a
seat
in
the
House
,
and
so
I
despise
politics
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Women
are
not
allowed
to
be
politicians
in
this
country
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Thank
God
,
they
ca
n't
do
much
in
that
way
;
 
not
directly
,
I
mean
.
<EOS>
Only
think
where
we
should
be
if
we
had
a
feminine
House
of
Commons
,
with
feminine
debates
,
carried
on
,
of
course
,
with
feminine
courtesy
.
<EOS>
My
cousins
Iphy
and
Phemy
there
would
of
course
be
members
.
<EOS>
You
do
n't
know
them
yet
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
not
yet
.
<EOS>
Are
they
politicians
?
"
  
"
Not
especially
.
<EOS>
They
have
their
tendencies
,
which
are
decidedly
liberal
.
<EOS>
There
has
never
been
a
Tory
Palliser
known
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
But
they
are
too
clever
to
give
themselves
up
to
anything
in
which
they
can
do
nothing
.
<EOS>
Being
women
they
live
a
depressed
life
,
devoting
themselves
to
literature
,
fine
arts
,
social
economy
,
and
the
abstract
sciences
.
<EOS>
They
write
wonderful
letters
;
but
I
believe
their
correspondence
lists
are
quite
full
,
so
that
you
have
no
chance
at
present
of
getting
on
either
of
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
n't
the
slightest
pretension
to
ask
for
such
an
honour
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
if
you
mean
because
you
do
n't
know
them
,
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
have
no
claim
either
private
or
public
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
either
.
<EOS>
They
do
n't
at
all
seek
people
of
note
as
their
correspondents
.
<EOS>
Free
communication
with
all
the
world
is
their
motto
,
and
Rowland
Hill
is
the
god
they
worship
.
<EOS>
Only
they
have
been
forced
to
guard
themselves
against
too
great
an
accession
of
paper
and
ink
.
<EOS>
Are
you
fond
of
writing
letters
,
Miss
Vavasor
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
to
my
friends
;
but
I
like
getting
them
better
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shrewdly
suspect
they
do
n't
read
half
what
they
get
.
<EOS>
Is
it
possible
any
one
should
go
through
two
sheets
of
paper
filled
by
our
friend
the
Duchess
there
?
<EOS>
No
;
their
delight
is
in
writing
.
<EOS>
They
sit
each
at
her
desk
after
breakfast
,
and
go
on
till
lunch
.
<EOS>
There
is
a
little
rivalry
between
them
,
not
expressed
to
each
other
,
but
visible
to
their
friends
.
<EOS>
Iphy
certainly
does
get
off
the
greater
number
,
and
I
'm
told
crosses
quite
as
often
as
Phemy
,
but
then
she
has
the
advantage
of
a
bolder
and
larger
hand
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
they
write
to
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
dear
<EOS>
no
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
think
they
ever
write
to
any
relative
.
<EOS>
They
do
n't
discuss
family
affairs
and
such
topics
as
that
.
<EOS>
Architecture
goes
a
long
way
with
them
,
and
whether
women
ought
to
be
clerks
in
public
offices
.
<EOS>
Iphy
has
certain
American
correspondents
that
take
up
much
of
her
time
,
but
she
acknowledges
she
does
not
read
their
letters
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
I
certainly
shall
not
write
to
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
are
not
American
,
I
hope
.
<EOS>
I
do
hate
the
Americans
.
<EOS>
It
's
the
only
strong
political
feeling
I
have
.
<EOS>
I
went
there
once
,
and
found
I
could
n't
live
with
them
on
any
terms
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
they
please
themselves
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
see
they
are
to
be
hated
because
they
do
n't
live
after
our
fashion
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
;
it
's
jealousy
of
course
.
<EOS>
I
know
that
.
<EOS>
I
did
n't
come
across
a
cab
-
driver
who
was
n't
a
much
better
educated
man
than
I
am
.
<EOS>
And
as
for
their
women
,
they
know
everything
.
<EOS>
But
I
hated
them
,
and
I
intend
to
hate
them
.
<EOS>
You
have
n't
been
there
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
no
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
I
will
make
bold
to
say
that
any
English
lady
who
spent
a
month
with
them
and
did
n't
hate
them
would
have
very
singular
tastes
.
<EOS>
I
begin
to
think
they
'll
eat
each
other
up
,
and
then
there
'll
come
an
entirely
new
set
of
people
of
a
different
sort
.
<EOS>
I
always
regarded
the
States
as
a
Sodom
and
Gomorrah
,
prospering
in
wickedness
,
on
which
fire
and
brimstone
were
sure
to
fall
sooner
or
later
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
that
's
wicked
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
wicked
,
as
Topsy
used
to
say
.
<EOS>
Do
you
hunt
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
shoot
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Shoot
!
<EOS>
What
;
with
a
gun
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
I
was
staying
in
a
house
last
week
with
a
lady
who
shot
a
good
deal
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
I
do
n't
shoot
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
ride
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
I
wish
I
did
.
<EOS>
I
have
never
ridden
because
I
've
no
one
to
ride
with
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
drive
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
I
do
n't
drive
either
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
what
do
you
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
sit
at
home
,
and
 
"
  
"
Mend
your
stockings
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
I
do
n't
do
that
,
because
it
's
disagreeable
;
but
I
do
work
a
good
deal
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
I
have
amused
myself
by
reading
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
;
they
never
do
that
here
.
<EOS>
I
have
heard
that
there
is
a
library
,
but
the
clue
to
it
has
been
lost
,
and
nobody
now
knows
the
way
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
believe
in
libraries
.
<EOS>
Nobody
ever
goes
into
a
library
to
read
,
any
more
than
you
would
into
a
larder
to
eat
.
<EOS>
But
there
is
this
difference
;
 
the
food
you
consume
does
come
out
of
the
larders
,
but
the
books
you
read
never
come
out
of
the
libraries
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Except
Mudie
's
,
"
said
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
yes
;
he
is
the
great
librarian
.
<EOS>
And
you
mean
to
read
all
the
time
you
are
here
,
Miss
Vavasor
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
mean
to
walk
about
the
priory
ruins
sometimes
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
you
must
go
by
moonlight
,
and
I
'll
go
with
you
.
<EOS>
Only
is
n't
it
rather
late
in
the
year
for
that
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
think
it
is
,
 
for
you
,
Mr.
Palliser
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Then
the
Duke
spoke
to
her
again
,
and
she
found
that
she
got
on
very
well
during
dinner
.
<EOS>
But
she
could
not
but
feel
angry
with
herself
in
that
she
had
any
fear
on
the
subject
;
 
and
yet
she
could
not
divest
herself
of
that
fear
.
<EOS>
She
acknowledged
to
herself
that
she
was
conscious
of
a
certain
inferiority
to
Lady
Glencora
and
to
Mr.
Jeffrey
Palliser
,
which
almost
made
her
unhappy
.
<EOS>
As
regarded
the
Duke
on
the
other
side
of
her
,
she
had
no
such
feeling
.
<EOS>
He
was
old
enough
to
be
her
father
,
and
was
a
Cabinet
Minister
;
therefore
he
was
entitled
to
her
reverence
.
<EOS>
But
how
was
it
that
she
could
not
help
accepting
the
other
people
<EOS>
round
her
as
being
indeed
superior
to
herself
?
<EOS>
Was
she
really
learning
to
believe
that
she
could
grow
upwards
by
their
sunlight
?
  
<EOS>
"
Jeffrey
is
a
pleasant
fellow
,
is
he
not
?
"
said
Lady
Glencora
to
her
as
they
passed
back
through
the
billiard
-
room
to
the
drawing
-
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
Very
pleasant
;
 
a
little
sarcastic
,
perhaps
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
think
you
would
soon
find
yourself
able
to
get
the
better
of
that
if
he
tries
it
upon
you
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
;
and
then
the
ladies
were
all
in
the
drawing
-
room
together
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
quite
deliciously
warm
,
coming
from
one
room
to
another
,
"
said
the
Duchess
,
putting
her
emphasis
on
the
"
one
"
and
the
"
other
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
we
had
better
keep
continually
moving
,
"
said
a
certain
Mrs.
Conway
Sparkes
,
a
literary
lady
,
who
had
been
very
handsome
,
who
was
still
very
clever
,
who
was
not
perhaps
very
good
-
natured
,
and
of
whom
the
Duchess
of
St.
Bungay
was
rather
afraid
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
we
may
be
warm
here
too
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
not
deliciously
warm
,
"
said
Mrs.
Conway
Sparkes
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
makes
me
tremble
in
every
limb
when
Mrs.
Sparkes
attacks
her
,
"
Lady
Glencora
said
to
Alice
in
Alice
's
own
room
that
night
,
"
for
I
know
she
'll
tell
the
Duke
;
and
he
'll
tell
that
tall
man
with
red
hair
whom
you
see
standing
about
,
and
the
tall
man
with
red
hair
will
tell
Mr.
Palliser
,
and
then
I
shall
catch
it
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
who
is
the
tall
man
with
red
hair
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
's
a
political
link
between
the
Duke
and
Mr.
Palliser
.
<EOS>
His
name
is
Bott
,
and
he
's
a
Member
of
Parliament
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
why
should
he
interfere
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
it
's
his
business
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
quite
understand
all
the
ins
and
outs
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
believe
he
's
to
be
one
of
Mr.
Palliser
's
private
secretaries
if
he
becomes
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
he
does
n't
tell
;
 
<EOS>
only
I
think
he
does
all
the
same
.
<EOS>
He
always
calls
me
Lady
Glen
-
cowrer
.
<EOS>
He
comes
out
of
Lancashire
,
and
made
calico
as
long
as
he
could
get
any
cotton
.
<EOS>
"
But
this
happened
in
the
bedroom
,
and
we
must
go
back
for
a
while
to
the
drawing
-
room
.
  
<EOS>
The
Duchess
had
made
no
answer
to
Mrs.
Sparkes
,
and
<EOS>
so
nothing
further
was
said
about
the
warmth
.
<EOS>
Nor
,
indeed
,
was
there
any
conversation
that
was
comfortably
general
.
<EOS>
The
number
of
ladies
in
the
room
was
too
great
for
that
,
and
ladies
do
not
divide
themselves
nicely
into
small
parties
,
as
men
and
women
do
when
they
are
mixed
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
behaved
pretty
by
telling
the
Duchess
all
about
her
pet
pheasants
;
Mrs.
Conway
Sparkes
told
ill
-
natured
tales
of
some
one
to
Miss
Euphemia
Palliser
;
one
of
the
Duchess
's
daughters
walked
off
to
a
distant
piano
with
an
admiring
friend
and
touched
a
few
notes
;
while
Iphigenia
Palliser
boldly
took
up
a
book
,
and
placed
herself
at
a
table
.
<EOS>
Alice
,
who
was
sitting
opposite
to
Lady
Glencora
,
began
to
speculate
whether
she
might
do
the
same
;
but
her
courage
failed
her
,
and
she
sat
on
,
telling
herself
that
she
was
out
of
her
element
.
"
<EOS>
Alice
Vavasor
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
after
a
while
,
suddenly
,
and
in
a
somewhat
loud
voice
,
"
can
you
play
billiards
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Alice
,
rather
startled
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
you
shall
learn
to
-
night
,
and
if
nobody
else
will
teach
you
,
you
shall
be
my
pupil
.
"
<EOS>
Whereupon
Lady
Glencora
rang
the
bell
and
ordered
that
the
billiard
-
table
might
be
got
ready
.
<EOS>
"
You
'll
play
,
Duchess
,
of
course
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
so
nice
and
warm
,
that
I
think
I
will
,
"
said
the
Duchess
;
but
as
she
spoke
she
looked
suspiciously
to
that
part
of
the
room
where
Mrs.
Conway
Sparkes
was
sitting
.
  
<EOS>
"
Let
us
all
play
,
"
said
Mrs.
Conway
Sparkes
,
"
and
then
it
will
be
nicer
,
 
and
perhaps
warmer
,
too
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
gentlemen
joined
them
just
as
they
were
settling
themselves
round
the
table
,
and
as
many
of
them
stayed
there
,
the
billiard
-
room
became
full
.
<EOS>
Alice
had
first
a
cue
put
into
her
hand
,
and
making
nothing
of
that
was
permitted
to
play
with
a
mace
.
<EOS>
The
duty
of
instructing
her
devolved
on
Jeffrey
Palliser
,
and
the
next
hour
passed
pleasantly
;
 
not
so
pleasantly
,
she
thought
afterwards
,
as
did
some
of
those
hours
in
Switzerland
when
her
cousins
were
with
her
.
<EOS>
After
all
,
she
could
get
more
out
of
her
life
with
such
associates
as
them
,
than
she
could
with
any
of
these
people
at
Matching
.
<EOS>
She
felt
quite
sure
of
that
;
 
though
Jeffrey
Palliser
did
take
great
trouble
to
teach
her
the
game
,
and
once
or
twice
made
her
laugh
heartily
by
quizzing
the
Duchess
's
attitude
as
she
stood
up
to
make
her
stroke
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
could
play
billiards
,
"
said
Mrs.
Sparkes
,
on
one
of
these
occasions
;
"
I
do
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
thought
you
said
you
were
coming
to
play
,
"
said
the
Duchess
,
almost
majestically
,
and
with
a
tone
of
triumph
evidently
produced
by
her
own
successes
.
  
<EOS>
"
Only
to
see
your
Grace
,
"
said
Mrs.
Sparkes
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
that
there
is
anything
more
to
see
in
me
than
in
anybody
else
,
"
said
the
Duchess
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
,
that
was
a
cannon
.
<EOS>
Will
you
mark
that
for
our
side
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
no
,
Duchess
,
you
hit
the
same
ball
twice
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Very
well
;
 
then
I
suppose
Miss
Vavasor
plays
now
.
<EOS>
That
was
a
miss
.
<EOS>
Will
you
mark
that
,
if
you
please
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
This
latter
demand
was
made
with
great
stress
,
as
though
she
had
been
defrauded
in
the
matter
of
the
cannon
,
and
was
obeyed
.
<EOS>
Before
long
,
the
Duchess
,
with
her
partner
,
Lady
Glencora
,
won
the
game
,
 
which
fact
,
however
,
was
,
I
think
,
owing
rather
to
Alice
's
ignorance
than
to
her
Grace
's
skill
.
<EOS>
The
Duchess
,
however
,
was
very
triumphant
,
and
made
her
way
back
into
the
drawing
-
room
with
a
step
which
seemed
to
declare
loudly
that
she
had
trumped
Mrs.
Sparkes
at
last
.
  
<EOS>
Not
long
after
this
the
ladies
went
up
-
stairs
on
their
way
to
bed
.
<EOS>
Many
of
them
,
perhaps
,
did
not
go
to
their
pillows
at
once
,
as
it
was
as
yet
not
eleven
o'clock
,
and
it
was
past
ten
when
they
all
came
down
to
breakfast
.
<EOS>
At
any
rate
,
Alice
,
who
had
been
up
at
seven
,
did
not
go
to
bed
then
,
nor
for
the
next
two
hours
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
come
into
your
room
just
for
one
minute
,
"
Lady
Glencora
said
as
she
passed
on
from
the
door
to
her
own
room
;
and
in
about
five
minutes
she
was
back
with
her
cousin
.
"
<EOS>
Would
you
mind
going
into
my
room
 
<EOS>
it
's
just
there
,
and
sitting
with
Ellen
for
a
minute
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
This
Lady
Glencora
said
in
the
sweetest
possible
tone
to
the
girl
who
was
waiting
on
Alice
;
and
then
,
when
they
were
alone
together
,
she
got
into
a
little
chair
by
the
fireside
and
prepared
herself
for
conversation
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
keep
you
up
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
while
I
tell
you
something
.
<EOS>
But
first
of
all
,
how
do
you
like
the
people
?
<EOS>
Will
you
be
able
to
be
comfortable
with
them
?
"
<EOS>
Alice
of
course
said
that
she
thought
she
would
;
and
then
there
came
that
little
discussion
in
which
the
duties
of
Mr.
Bott
,
the
man
with
the
red
hair
,
were
described
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
've
got
something
to
tell
you
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
,
when
they
had
already
been
there
some
twenty
minutes
.
<EOS>
"
Sit
down
opposite
to
me
,
and
look
at
the
fire
while
I
look
at
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
it
anything
terrible
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
nothing
wrong
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Lady
Glencora
,
if
it
's
 
"
  
"
I
wo
n't
have
you
call
me
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
I
call
you
Alice
?
<EOS>
Why
are
you
so
unkind
to
me
?
<EOS>
I
have
not
come
to
you
now
asking
you
to
do
for
me
anything
that
you
ought
not
to
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
are
going
to
tell
me
something
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Alice
felt
sure
that
the
thing
to
be
told
would
have
some
reference
to
Mr.
Fitzgerald
,
and
she
did
not
wish
to
hear
Mr.
Fitzgerald
's
name
from
her
cousin
's
lips
.
  
<EOS>
"
Tell
you
something
;
 
of
course
I
am
.
<EOS>
I
'm
going
to
tell
you
that
,
 
that
in
writing
to
you
the
other
day
I
wrote
a
fib
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
n't
that
I
wished
to
deceive
you
;
 
only
I
could
n't
say
it
all
in
a
letter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Say
all
what
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
I
confessed
that
I
had
been
very
bad
in
not
coming
to
you
in
London
last
year
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
thought
of
it
for
a
moment
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
did
not
care
whether
I
came
or
not
:
was
that
it
?
<EOS>
But
never
mind
.
<EOS>
Why
should
you
have
cared
?
<EOS>
But
I
cared
.
<EOS>
I
told
you
in
my
letter
that
I
did
n't
come
because
I
had
so
many
things
on
hand
.
<EOS>
Of
course
that
was
a
fib
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Everybody
makes
excuses
of
that
kind
,
"
said
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
they
do
n't
make
them
to
the
very
people
of
all
others
whom
they
want
to
know
and
love
.
<EOS>
I
was
longing
to
come
to
you
every
day
.
<EOS>
But
I
feared
I
could
not
come
without
speaking
of
him
;
 
and
I
had
determined
never
to
speak
of
him
again
.
<EOS>
"
This
she
said
in
that
peculiar
low
voice
which
she
assumed
at
times
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
why
do
it
now
,
Lady
Glencora
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wo
n't
be
called
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
Call
me
Cora

<EOS>
I
had
a
sister
once
,
older
than
I
,
and
she
used
to
call
me
Cora
.
<EOS>
If
she
had
lived
 
.
<EOS>
But
never
mind
that
now

<EOS>
She
did
n't
live

<EOS>
I
'll
tell
you
why
I
do
it
now

<EOS>
Because
I
can
not
help
it
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
I
've
met
him
.
<EOS>
I
've
been
in
the
same
room
with
him
,
and
have
spoken
to
him
.
<EOS>
What
's
the
good
of
any
such
resolution
now
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
have
met
him
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
he
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
 
knew
all
about
it
.
<EOS>
When
he
talked
of
taking
me
to
the
house
,
I
whispered
to
him
that
I
thought
Burgo
would
be
there
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
not
call
him
by
his
Christian
name
,
"
said
Alice
,
almost
with
a
shudder
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
not
?
 
<EOS>
why
not
his
Christian
name
?
<EOS>
I
did
when
I
told
my
husband
.
<EOS>
Or
perhaps
I
said
Burgo
Fitzgerald
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Well
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
he
bade
me
go
.
<EOS>
He
said
it
did
n't
signify
,
and
that
I
had
better
learn
to
bear
it
.
<EOS>
Bear
it
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
If
I
am
to
meet
him
,
and
speak
to
him
,
and
look
at
him
,
surely
I
may
mention
his
name
.
"
<EOS>
And
then
she
paused
for
an
answer
.
"
<EOS>
May
I
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
am
I
to
say
?
"
exclaimed
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
Anything
you
please
,
that
's
not
a
falsehood
.
<EOS>
But
I
've
got
you
here
because
I
do
n't
think
you
will
tell
a
falsehood
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
Alice
,
I
do
so
want
to
go
right
,
and
it
is
so
hard
!
"
  
<EOS>
Hard
,
indeed
,
poor
creature
,
for
one
so
weighted
as
she
had
been
,
and
sent
out
into
the
world
with
so
small
advantages
of
previous
training
or
of
present
friendship
!
<EOS>
Alice
began
to
feel
now
that
she
had
been
enticed
to
Matching
Priory
because
her
cousin
wanted
a
friend
,
and
of
course
she
could
not
refuse
to
give
the
friendship
that
was
asked
from
her
.
<EOS>
She
got
up
from
her
chair
,
and
kneeling
down
at
the
other
's
feet
put
up
her
face
and
kissed
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
knew
you
would
be
good
to
me
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
"
I
knew
you
would
.
<EOS>
And
you
may
say
whatever
you
like
.
<EOS>
But
I
could
not
bear
that
you
should
not
know
the
real
reason
why
I
neither
came
to
you
nor
sent
for
you
after
we
went
to
London
.
<EOS>
You
'll
come
to
me
now
;
wo
n't
you
,
dear
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Yes
;
 
and
you
'll
come
to
me
,
"
said
Alice
,
making
in
her
mind
a
sort
of
bargain
that
she
was
not
to
be
received
into
Mr.
Palliser
's
house
after
the
fashion
in
which
Lady
Midlothian
had
proposed
to
receive
her
.
<EOS>
But
it
struck
her
at
once
that
this
was
unworthy
of
her
,
and
ungenerous
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
'll
come
to
you
,
"
she
added
,
"
<EOS>
whether
you
come
to
me
or
not
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
go
to
you
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
,
"
of
course
,
 
why
should
n't
I
?
<EOS>
But
you
know
what
I
mean
.
<EOS>
We
shall
have
dinners
and
parties
and
lots
of
people
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
we
shall
have
none
,
"
said
Alice
,
smiling
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
therefore
there
is
so
much
more
excuse
for
your
coming
to
me
;
 
or
rather
<EOS>
I
mean
so
much
more
reason
,
for
I
do
n't
want
excuses
.
<EOS>
Well
,
dear
,
I
'm
so
glad
I
've
told
you
.
<EOS>
I
was
afraid
to
see
you
in
London
.
<EOS>
I
should
hardly
have
known
how
to
look
at
you
then
.
<EOS>
But
I
've
got
over
that
now
.
<EOS>
"
Then
she
smiled
and
returned
the
kiss
which
Alice
had
given
her
.
<EOS>
It
was
singular
to
see
her
standing
on
the
bedroom
rug
with
all
her
magnificence
of
dress
,
but
with
her
hair
pushed
back
behind
her
ears
,
and
her
eyes
red
with
tears
,
 
as
though
the
burden
of
the
magnificence
remained
to
her
after
its
purpose
was
over
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
declare
it
's
ever
so
much
past
twelve
.
<EOS>
Good
night
,
now
,
dear
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
whether
he
's
come
up
.
<EOS>
But
I
should
have
heard
his
step
if
he
had
.
<EOS>
He
never
treads
lightly
.
<EOS>
He
seldom
gives
over
work
till
after
one
,
and
sometimes
goes
on
till
three
.
<EOS>
It
's
the
only
thing
he
likes
,
I
believe
.
<EOS>
God
bless
you
!
<EOS>
good
night
.
<EOS>
I
've
such
a
deal
more
to
say
to
you
;
and
Alice
,
you
must
tell
me
something
about
yourself
,
too
;
wo
n't
you
,
dear
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Then
without
waiting
for
an
answer
Lady
Glencora
went
,
leaving
Alice
in
a
maze
of
bewilderment
.
<EOS>
She
could
hardly
believe
that
all
she
had
heard
,
and
all
she
had
done
,
had
happened
since
she
left
Queen
Anne
Street
that
morning
.
   
<EOS>
Three
Politicians
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
was
one
of
those
politicians
in
possessing
whom
England
has
perhaps
more
reason
to
be
proud
than
of
any
other
of
her
resources
,
and
who
,
as
a
body
,
give
to
her
that
exquisite
combination
of
conservatism
and
progress
which
is
her
present
strength
and
best
security
for
the
future
.
<EOS>
He
could
afford
to
learn
to
be
a
statesman
,
and
had
the
industry
wanted
for
such
training
.
<EOS>
He
was
born
in
the
purple
,
noble
himself
,
and
heir
to
the
highest
rank
as
well
as
one
of
the
greatest
fortunes
of
the
country
,
already
very
rich
,
surrounded
by
all
the
temptations
of
luxury
and
pleasure
;
and
yet
he
devoted
himself
to
work
with
the
grinding
energy
of
a
young
penniless
barrister
labouring
for
a
penniless
wife
,
and
did
so
without
any
motive
more
selfish
than
that
of
being
counted
in
the
roll
of
the
public
servants
of
England
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
a
brilliant
man
,
and
understood
well
that
such
was
the
case
.
<EOS>
He
was
now
listened
to
in
the
House
,
as
the
phrase
goes
;
but
he
was
listened
to
as
a
laborious
man
,
who
was
in
earnest
in
what
he
did
,
who
got
up
his
facts
with
accuracy
,
and
who
,
dull
though
he
be
,
was
worthy
of
confidence
.
<EOS>
And
he
was
very
dull
.
<EOS>
He
rather
prided
himself
on
being
dull
,
and
on
conquering
in
spite
of
his
dullness
.
<EOS>
He
never
allowed
himself
a
joke
in
his
speeches
,
nor
attempted
even
the
smallest
flourish
of
rhetoric
.
<EOS>
He
was
very
careful
in
his
language
,
labouring
night
and
day
to
learn
to
express
himself
with
accuracy
,
with
no
needless
repetition
of
words
,
perspicuously
with
regard
to
the
special
object
he
might
have
in
view
.
<EOS>
He
had
taught
himself
to
believe
that
oratory
,
as
oratory
,
was
a
sin
against
that
honesty
in
politics
by
which
he
strove
to
guide
himself
.
<EOS>
He
desired
to
use
words
for
the
purpose
of
teaching
things
which
he
knew
and
which
others
did
not
know
;
and
he
desired
also
to
be
honoured
for
his
knowledge
.
<EOS>
But
he
had
no
desire
to
be
honoured
for
the
language
in
which
his
knowledge
was
conveyed
.
<EOS>
He
was
an
upright
,
thin
,
laborious
man
;
who
by
his
parts
alone
could
have
served
no
political
party
materially
,
but
whose
parts
were
sufficient
to
make
his
education
,
integrity
,
and
industry
useful
in
the
highest
degree
.
<EOS>
It
is
the
trust
which
such
men
inspire
which
makes
them
so
serviceable
;
 
trust
not
only
in
their
labour
,
 
for
any
man
rising
from
the
mass
of
the
people
may
be
equally
laborious
;
nor
yet
simply
in
their
honesty
and
patriotism
.
<EOS>
The
confidence
is
given
to
their
labour
,
honesty
,
and
patriotism
joined
to
such
a
personal
stake
in
the
country
as
gives
them
a
weight
and
ballast
which
no
politician
in
England
can
possess
without
it
.
  
<EOS>
If
he
was
dull
as
a
statesman
he
was
more
dull
in
private
life
,
and
it
may
be
imagined
that
such
a
woman
as
his
wife
would
find
some
difficulty
in
making
his
society
the
source
of
her
happiness
.
<EOS>
Their
marriage
,
in
a
point
of
view
regarding
business
,
had
been
a
complete
success
,
 
and
a
success
,
too
,
when
on
the
one
side
,
that
of
Lady
Glencora
,
there
had
been
terrible
dangers
of
shipwreck
,
and
when
on
his
side
also
there
had
been
some
little
fears
of
a
mishap
.
<EOS>
As
regards
her
it
has
been
told
how
near
she
went
to
throwing
herself
,
with
all
her
vast
wealth
,
into
the
arms
of
a
young
man
,
whom
no
father
,
no
guardian
could
have
regarded
as
a
well
-
chosen
husband
for
any
girl
;
 
one
who
as
yet
had
shown
no
good
qualities
,
who
had
been
a
spendthrift
,
unprincipled
,
and
debauched
.
<EOS>
Alas
,
she
had
loved
him
!
<EOS>
It
is
possible
that
her
love
and
her
wealth
might
have
turned
him
from
evil
to
good
.
<EOS>
But
who
would
have
ventured
to
risk
her
,
 
I
will
not
say
her
and
her
vast
inheritances
,
 
on
such
a
chance
?
<EOS>
That
evil
,
however
,
had
been
prevented
,
and
those
about
her
had
managed
to
marry
her
to
a
young
man
,
very
steady
by
nature
,
with
worldly
prospects
as
brilliant
as
her
own
,
and
with
a
station
than
which
the
world
offers
nothing
higher
.
<EOS>
His
little
threatened
mischance
,
 
a
passing
fancy
for
a
married
lady
who
was
too
wise
to
receive
vows
which
were
proffered
not
in
the
most
ardent
manner
,
 
had
,
from
special
reasons
,
given
some
little
alarm
to
his
uncle
,
which
had
just
sufficed
at
the
time
to
make
so
very
judicious
a
marriage
doubly
pleasant
to
that
noble
duke
,
So
that
all
things
and
all
people
had
conspired
to
shower
substantial
comforts
on
the
heads
of
this
couple
,
when
they
were
joined
together
,
and
men
and
women
had
not
yet
ceased
to
declare
how
happy
were
both
in
the
accumulated
gifts
of
fortune
.
  
<EOS>
And
as
regards
Mr.
Palliser
,
I
think
that
his
married
life
,
and
the
wife
,
whom
he
certainly
had
not
chosen
,
but
who
had
dropped
upon
him
,
suited
him
admirably
.
<EOS>
He
wanted
great
wealth
for
that
position
at
which
he
aimed
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
rich
before
his
marriage
with
his
own
wealth
,
 
so
rich
that
he
could
throw
thousands
away
if
he
wished
it
;
but
for
him
and
his
career
was
needed
that
colossal
wealth
which
would
make
men
talk
about
it
,
 
which
would
necessitate
an
expansive
expenditure
,
reaching
far
and
wide
,
doing
nothing
,
or
less
than
nothing
,
for
his
own
personal
comfort
,
but
giving
to
him
at
once
that
rock
-
like
solidity
which
is
so
necessary
to
our
great
aristocratic
politicians
.
<EOS>
And
his
wife
was
,
as
far
as
he
knew
,
all
that
he
desired
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
dabbled
much
in
the
fountains
of
Venus
,
though
he
had
forgotten
himself
once
,
and
sinned
in
coveting
another
man
's
wife
.
<EOS>
But
his
sin
then
had
hardly
polluted
his
natural
character
,
and
his
desire
had
been
of
a
kind
which
was
almost
more
gratified
in
its
disappointment
than
it
would
have
been
in
its
fruition
.
<EOS>
On
the
morning
after
the
lady
had
frowned
on
him
he
had
told
himself
that
he
was
very
well
out
of
that
trouble
.
<EOS>
He
knew
that
it
would
never
be
for
him
to
hang
up
on
the
walls
of
a
temple
a
well
-
worn
lute
as
a
votive
offering
when
leaving
the
pursuits
of
love
.
<EOS>
_
Idoneus
puellis
_
he
never
could
have
been
.
<EOS>
So
he
married
Lady
Glencora
and
was
satisfied
.
<EOS>
The
story
of
Burgo
Fitzgerald
was
told
to
him
,
and
he
supposed
that
most
girls
had
some
such
story
to
tell
.
<EOS>
He
thought
little
about
it
,
and
by
no
means
understood
her
when
she
said
to
him
,
with
all
the
impressiveness
which
she
could
throw
into
the
words
,
"
You
must
know
that
I
have
really
loved
him
.
"
<EOS>
"
You
must
love
me
now
,
"
he
had
replied
with
a
smile
;
and
then
as
regarded
his
mind
,
the
thing
was
over
.
<EOS>
And
since
his
marriage
he
had
thought
that
things
matrimonial
had
gone
well
with
him
,
and
with
her
too
.
<EOS>
He
gave
her
almost
unlimited
power
of
enjoying
her
money
,
and
interfered
but
little
in
her
way
of
life
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
he
would
say
a
word
of
caution
to
her
with
reference
to
those
childish
ways
which
hardly
became
the
dull
dignity
of
his
position
;
and
his
words
then
would
have
in
them
something
of
unintentional
severity
,
 
whether
instigated
or
not
by
the
red
-
haired
Radical
Member
of
Parliament
,
I
will
not
pretend
to
say
;
 
but
on
the
whole
he
was
contented
and
loved
his
wife
,
as
he
thought
,
very
heartily
,
and
at
least
better
than
he
loved
any
one
else
.
<EOS>
One
cause
of
unhappiness
,
or
rather
one
doubt
as
to
his
entire
good
fortune
,
was
beginning
to
make
itself
felt
,
as
his
wife
had
to
her
sorrow
already
discovered
.
<EOS>
He
had
hoped
that
before
this
he
might
have
heard
that
she
would
give
him
a
child
.
<EOS>
But
the
days
were
young
yet
for
that
trouble
,
and
the
care
had
not
become
a
sorrow
.
  
<EOS>
But
this
judicious
arrangement
as
to
properties
,
this
well
-
ordered
alliance
between
families
,
had
not
perhaps
suited
her
as
well
as
it
had
suited
him
.
<EOS>
I
think
that
she
might
have
learned
to
forget
her
early
lover
,
or
to
look
back
upon
it
with
a
soft
melancholy
hardly
amounting
to
regret
,
had
her
new
lord
been
more
tender
in
his
ways
with
her
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
that
Lady
Glencora
's
heart
was
made
of
that
stern
stuff
which
refuses
to
change
its
impressions
;
but
it
was
a
heart
,
and
it
required
food
.
<EOS>
To
love
and
fondle
someone
,
 
to
be
loved
and
fondled
,
were
absolutely
necessary
to
her
happiness
.
<EOS>
She
wanted
the
little
daily
assurance
of
her
supremacy
in
the
man
's
feelings
,
the
constant
touch
of
love
,
half
accidental
half
contrived
,
the
passing
glance
of
the
eye
telling
perhaps
of
some
little
joke
understood
only
between
them
two
rather
than
of
love
,
the
softness
of
an
occasional
kiss
given
here
and
there
when
chance
might
bring
them
together
,
some
half
-
pretended
interest
in
her
little
doings
,
a
nod
,
a
wink
,
a
shake
of
the
head
,
or
even
a
pout
.
<EOS>
It
should
have
been
given
to
her
to
feed
upon
such
food
as
this
daily
,
and
then
she
would
have
forgotten
Burgo
Fitzgerald
.
<EOS>
But
Mr.
Palliser
understood
none
of
these
things
;
and
therefore
the
image
of
Burgo
Fitzgerald
in
all
his
beauty
was
ever
before
her
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
But
not
the
less
was
Mr.
Palliser
<EOS>
a
prosperous
man
,
as
to
the
success
of
whose
career
few
who
knew
him
had
much
doubt
.
<EOS>
It
might
be
written
in
the
book
of
his
destiny
that
he
would
have
to
pass
through
some
violent
domestic
trouble
,
some
ruin
in
the
hopes
of
his
home
,
of
a
nature
to
destroy
then
and
for
ever
the
worldly
prospects
of
other
men
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
one
who
would
pass
through
such
violence
,
should
it
come
upon
him
,
without
much
scathe
.
<EOS>
To
lose
his
influence
with
his
party
would
be
worse
to
him
than
to
lose
his
wife
,
and
public
disgrace
would
hit
him
harder
than
private
dishonour
.
  
<EOS>
And
the
present
was
the
very
moment
in
which
success
was
,
as
was
said
,
coming
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
had
already
held
laborious
office
under
the
Crown
,
but
had
never
sat
in
the
Cabinet
.
<EOS>
He
had
worked
much
harder
than
Cabinet
Ministers
generally
work
,
 
but
hitherto
had
worked
without
any
reward
that
was
worth
his
having
.
<EOS>
For
the
stipend
which
he
had
received
had
been
nothing
to
him
,
 
as
the
great
stipend
which
he
would
receive
,
if
his
hopes
were
true
,
would
also
be
nothing
to
him
.
<EOS>
To
have
ascendancy
over
other
men
,
to
be
known
by
his
countrymen
as
one
of
their
real
rulers
,
to
have
an
actual
and
acknowledged
voice
in
the
management
of
nations
,
 
those
were
the
rewards
for
which
he
looked
;
and
now
in
truth
it
seemed
as
though
they
were
coming
to
him
.
<EOS>
It
was
all
but
known
that
the
existing
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
would
separate
himself
from
the
Government
,
carrying
various
others
with
him
,
either
before
or
immediately
consequent
on
the
meeting
of
Parliament
;
 
and
it
was
all
but
known
,
also
,
that
Mr.
Palliser
would
fill
his
place
,
taking
that
high
office
at
once
,
although
he
had
never
hitherto
sat
in
that
august
assembly
which
men
call
the
Cabinet
.
<EOS>
He
could
thus
afford
to
put
up
with
the
small
everyday
calamity
of
having
a
wife
who
loved
another
man
better
than
she
loved
him
.
  
<EOS>
The
presence
of
the
Duke
of
St.
Bungay
at
Matching
was
assumed
to
be
a
sure
sign
of
Mr.
Palliser
's
coming
triumph
.
<EOS>
The
Duke
was
a
statesman
of
a
very
different
class
,
but
he
also
had
been
eminently
successful
as
an
aristocratic
pillar
of
the
British
Constitutional
Republic
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
minister
of
very
many
years
"
standing
,
being
as
used
to
cabinet
sittings
as
other
men
are
to
their
own
armchairs
;
but
he
had
never
been
a
hard
-
working
man
.
<EOS>
Though
a
constant
politician
,
he
had
ever
taken
politics
easy
whether
in
office
or
out
.
<EOS>
The
world
had
said
before
now
that
the
Duke
might
be
Premier
,
only
that
he
would
not
take
the
trouble
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
consulted
by
a
very
distinguished
person
,
 
so
the
papers
had
said
more
than
once
,
 
as
to
the
making
of
Prime
Ministers
.
<EOS>
His
voice
in
council
was
esteemed
to
be
very
great
.
<EOS>
He
was
regarded
as
a
strong
rock
of
support
to
the
liberal
cause
,
and
yet
nobody
ever
knew
what
he
did
;
nor
was
there
much
record
of
what
he
said
.
<EOS>
The
offices
which
he
held
,
or
had
held
,
were
generally
those
to
which
no
very
arduous
duties
were
attached
.
<EOS>
In
severe
debates
he
never
took
upon
himself
the
brunt
of
opposition
oratory
.
<EOS>
What
he
said
in
the
House
was
generally
short
and
pleasant
,
 
with
some
slight
,
drolling
,
undercurrent
of
uninjurious
satire
running
through
it
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
a
walking
miracle
of
the
wisdom
of
common
sense
.
<EOS>
He
never
lost
his
temper
.
<EOS>
He
never
made
mistakes
.
<EOS>
He
never
grew
either
hot
or
cold
in
a
cause
.
<EOS>
He
was
never
reckless
in
politics
,
and
never
cowardly
.
<EOS>
He
snubbed
no
man
,
and
took
snubbings
from
no
man
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
Knight
of
the
Garter
,
a
Lord
Lieutenant
of
his
county
,
and
at
sixty
-
two
had
his
digestion
unimpaired
and
his
estate
in
excellent
order
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
great
buyer
of
pictures
,
which
,
perhaps
,
he
did
not
understand
,
and
a
great
collector
of
books
which
certainly
he
never
read
.
<EOS>
All
the
world
respected
him
,
and
he
was
a
man
to
whom
the
respect
of
all
the
world
was
as
the
breath
of
his
nostrils
.
  
<EOS>
But
even
he
was
not
without
his
peacock
on
the
wall
,
his
skeleton
in
the
closet
,
his
thorn
in
his
side
;
though
the
peacock
did
not
scream
loud
,
the
skeleton
was
not
very
terrible
in
his
anatomical
arrangement
,
nor
was
the
thorn
likely
to
fester
to
a
gangrene
.
<EOS>
The
Duke
was
always
in
awe
about
his
wife
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
ever
uneasy
about
his
wife
,
but
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
he
feared
the
machinations
of
any
Burgo
Fitzgerald
as
being
destructive
of
his
domestic
comfort
.
<EOS>
The
Duchess
was
and
always
had
been
all
that
is
proper
.
<EOS>
Ladies
in
high
rank
,
when
gifted
with
excelling
beauty
,
have
often
been
made
the
marks
of
undeserved
calumny
;
 
but
no
breath
of
slander
had
ever
touched
her
name
.
<EOS>
I
doubt
if
any
man
alive
had
ever
had
the
courage
even
to
wink
at
her
since
the
Duke
had
first
called
her
his
own
.
<EOS>
Nor
was
she
a
spendthrift
,
or
a
gambler
.
<EOS>
She
was
not
fast
in
her
tastes
,
or
given
to
any
pursuit
that
was
objectionable
.
<EOS>
She
was
simply
a
fool
,
and
as
a
fool
was
ever
fearing
that
she
was
the
mark
of
ridicule
.
<EOS>
In
all
such
miseries
she
would
complain
sorrowfully
,
piteously
,
and
occasionally
very
angrily
,
to
her
dear
Duke
and
protector
;
till
sometimes
her
dear
Duke
did
not
quite
know
what
to
do
with
her
or
how
to
protect
her
.
<EOS>
It
did
not
suit
him
,
a
Knight
of
the
Garter
and
a
Duke
of
St.
Bungay
,
to
beg
mercy
for
that
poor
wife
of
his
from
such
a
one
as
Mrs.
Conway
Sparkes
;
nor
would
it
be
more
in
his
way
to
lodge
a
formal
complaint
against
that
lady
before
his
host
or
hostess
,
 
as
one
boy
at
school
may
sometimes
do
as
regards
another
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
do
n't
like
the
people
,
my
dear
,
we
will
go
away
,
"
he
said
to
her
late
on
that
evening
of
which
we
have
spoken
.
"
<EOS>
No
,
"
she
replied
,
"
I
do
not
wish
to
go
away
.
<EOS>
I
have
said
that
we
would
stay
till
December
,
and
Longroyston
wo
n't
be
ready
before
that
.
<EOS>
But
I
think
that
something
ought
to
be
done
to
silence
that
woman
.
"
<EOS>
And
the
accent
came
strong
upon
"
something
,
"
and
then
again
with
terrific
violence
upon
"
woman
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
Duke
did
not
know
how
to
silence
Mrs.
Conway
Sparkes
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
great
principle
of
his
life
never
to
be
angry
with
any
one
.
<EOS>
How
could
he
get
at
Mrs.
Conway
Sparkes
?
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
she
is
worth
your
attention
,
"
said
the
husband
.
<EOS>
"
That
's
all
very
well
,
Duke
,
"
said
the
wife
,
"
and
perhaps
she
is
not
.
<EOS>
But
I
find
her
in
this
house
,
and
I
do
n't
like
to
be
laughed
at
.
<EOS>
I
think
Lady
Glencora
should
make
her
know
her
place
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Lady
Glencora
is
very
young
,
my
dear
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
about
being
so
very
young
,
"
said
the
Duchess
,
whose
ear
had
perhaps
caught
some
little
hint
of
poor
Lady
Glencora
's
almost
unintentional
mimicry
.
<EOS>
Now
as
appeals
of
this
kind
were
being
made
frequently
to
the
Duke
,
and
as
he
was
often
driven
to
say
some
word
,
of
which
he
himself
hardly
approved
,
to
some
one
in
protection
of
his
Duchess
,
he
was
aware
that
the
matter
was
an
annoyance
,
and
at
times
almost
wished
that
her
Grace
was
at
 
Longroyston
.
  
<EOS>
And
there
was
a
third
politician
staying
at
Matching
Priory
who
had
never
yet
risen
to
the
rank
of
a
statesman
,
but
who
had
his
hopes
.
<EOS>
This
was
Mr.
Bott
,
the
member
for
St.
Helens
,
whom
Lady
Glencora
had
described
as
a
man
who
stood
about
,
with
red
hair
,
 
and
perhaps
told
tales
of
her
to
her
husband
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bott
was
a
person
who
certainly
had
had
some
success
in
life
and
who
had
won
it
for
himself
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
very
young
,
being
at
this
time
only
just
on
the
right
side
of
fifty
.
<EOS>
He
was
now
enjoying
his
second
session
in
Parliament
,
having
been
returned
as
a
pledged
disciple
of
the
Manchester
school
.
<EOS>
Nor
had
he
apparently
been
false
to
his
pledges
.
<EOS>
At
St.
Helens
he
was
still
held
to
be
a
good
man
and
true
.
<EOS>
But
they
who
sat
on
the
same
side
with
him
in
the
House
and
watched
his
political
manoeuvres
,
knew
that
he
was
striving
hard
to
get
his
finger
into
the
public
pie
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
a
rich
man
,
though
he
had
made
calico
and
had
got
into
Parliament
.
<EOS>
And
though
he
claimed
to
be
a
thoroughgoing
<EOS>
Radical
<EOS>
,
he
was
a
man
who
liked
to
live
with
aristocrats
,
and
was
fond
of
listening
to
the
whispers
of
such
as
the
Duke
of
St.
Bungay
or
Mr.
Palliser
.
<EOS>
It
was
supposed
that
he
did
understand
something
of
finance
.
<EOS>
He
was
at
any
rate
great
in
figures
;
and
as
he
was
possessed
of
much
industry
,
and
was
obedient
withal
,
he
was
a
man
who
might
make
himself
useful
to
a
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
ambitious
of
changes
.
  
<EOS>
There
are
men
who
get
into
such
houses
as
Matching
Priory
and
<EOS>
whose
presence
there
is
a
mystery
to
many
;
 
as
to
whom
the
ladies
of
the
house
never
quite
understand
why
they
are
entertaining
such
a
guest
.
"
<EOS>
And
Mr.
Bott
is
coming
,
"
Mr.
Palliser
had
said
to
his
wife
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Bott
!
"
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
had
answered
.
<EOS>
"
Goodness
me
!
<EOS>
who
is
Mr.
Bott
?
"
<EOS>
"
He
is
member
for
St.
Helens
,
"
said
Mr.
Palliser
.
<EOS>
"
A
very
serviceable
man
in
his
way
.
"
<EOS>
"
And
what
am
I
to
do
with
him
?
"
asked
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
that
you
can
do
anything
with
him
.
<EOS>
He
is
a
man
who
has
a
great
deal
of
business
,
and
I
dare
say
he
will
spend
most
of
his
time
in
the
library
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
So
Mr.
Bott
arrived
.
<EOS>
But
though
a
huge
pile
of
letters
and
papers
came
to
him
every
morning
by
post
,
he
unfortunately
did
not
seem
to
spend
much
of
his
time
in
the
library
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
he
had
not
found
the
clue
to
that
lost
apartment
.
<EOS>
Twice
he
went
out
shooting
,
but
as
on
the
first
day
he
shot
the
keeper
,
and
on
the
second
very
nearly
shot
the
Duke
,
he
gave
that
up
.
<EOS>
Hunting
he
declined
,
though
much
pressed
to
make
an
essay
in
that
art
by
Jeffrey
Palliser
.
<EOS>
He
seemed
to
spend
his
time
,
as
Lady
Glencora
said
,
in
standing
about
,
 
except
at
certain
times
when
he
was
closeted
with
Mr.
Palliser
,
and
when
,
it
may
be
presumed
,
he
made
himself
useful
.
<EOS>
On
such
days
he
would
be
seen
at
the
hour
of
lunch
with
fingers
much
stained
with
ink
,
and
it
was
generally
supposed
that
on
those
occasions
he
had
been
counting
up
taxes
and
calculating
the
effect
of
great
financial
changes
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
tall
,
wiry
,
strong
man
,
with
a
bald
head
and
bristly
red
beard
,
which
,
however
,
was
cut
off
from
his
upper
and
under
lip
.
<EOS>
This
was
unfortunate
,
as
had
he
hidden
his
mouth
<EOS>
he
would
not
have
been
in
so
marked
a
degree
an
ugly
man
.
<EOS>
His
upper
lip
was
very
long
,
and
his
mouth
was
mean
.
<EOS>
But
he
had
found
that
without
the
help
of
a
razor
to
these
parts
he
could
not
manage
his
soup
to
his
satisfaction
,
and
preferring
cleanliness
to
beauty
had
shaved
himself
accordingly
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
n't
dislike
Mr.
Bott
so
much
,
"
Lady
Glencora
said
to
her
husband
,
"
if
he
did
n't
rub
his
hands
and
smile
so
often
,
and
seem
to
be
going
to
say
something
when
he
really
is
not
going
to
say
anything
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
you
need
trouble
yourself
about
him
,
my
dear
,
"
Mr.
Palliser
had
answered
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
when
he
looks
at
me
in
that
way
,
I
ca
n't
help
stopping
,
as
I
think
he
is
going
to
speak
;
and
then
he
always
says
,
"
Can
I
do
anything
for
you
,
Lady
Glen
-
cowrer
?
"
<EOS>
"
  
She
instantly
saw
that
her
husband
did
not
like
this
.
"
Do
n't
be
angry
with
me
,
dear
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
admit
that
he
is
rather
a
bore
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
at
all
angry
,
Glencora
,
"
said
the
husband
;
"
and
if
you
insist
upon
it
,
I
will
see
that
he
leaves
;
 
and
in
such
case
will
of
course
never
ask
him
again
.
<EOS>
But
that
might
be
prejudicial
to
me
,
as
he
is
a
man
whom
I
trust
in
politics
,
and
who
may
perhaps
be
serviceable
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Of
course
Lady
Glencora
declared
that
Mr.
Bott
might
remain
as
long
as
he
and
her
husband
desired
,
and
of
course
she
mentioned
his
name
no
more
to
Mr.
Palliser
;
but
from
that
time
forth
she
regarded
Mr.
Bott
as
an
enemy
,
and
felt
also
that
Mr.
Bott
regarded
her
in
the
same
light
.
  
<EOS>
When
it
was
known
among
outside
politicians
that
the
Duke
of
St.
Bungay
was
staying
at
Matching
Priory
,
outside
<EOS>
politicians
became
more
sure
than
ever
that
Mr.
Palliser
would
be
the
new
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
.
<EOS>
The
old
minister
and
the
young
minister
were
of
course
arranging
matters
together
.
<EOS>
But
I
doubt
whether
Mr.
Palliser
and
the
Duke
ever
spoke
on
any
such
topic
during
the
entire
visit
.
<EOS>
Though
Mr.
Bott
was
occasionally
closeted
with
Mr.
Palliser
,
the
Duke
never
troubled
himself
with
such
closetings
.
<EOS>
He
went
out
shooting
 
on
his
pony
,
read
his
newspaper
,
wrote
his
notes
,
and
looked
with
the
eye
of
a
connoisseur
over
all
Mr.
Palliser
's
farming
apparatus
.
<EOS>
"
You
seem
to
have
a
good
man
,
I
should
say
,
"
said
the
Duke
.
<EOS>
"
What
!
<EOS>
Hubbings
?
<EOS>
Yes
;
 
he
was
a
legacy
from
my
uncle
when
he
gave
me
up
the
Priory
.
"
<EOS>
"
A
very
good
man
,
I
should
say
.
<EOS>
Of
course
he
wo
n't
make
it
pay
;
but
he
'll
make
it
look
as
though
it
did
;
 
which
is
the
next
best
thing
.
<EOS>
I
could
never
get
rent
out
of
land
that
I
farmed
myself
,
 
never
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
not
,
"
said
Mr.
Palliser
,
who
did
not
care
much
about
it
.
<EOS>
The
Duke
would
have
talked
to
him
by
the
hour
together
about
farming
had
Mr.
Palliser
been
so
minded
;
but
he
talked
to
him
very
little
about
politics
.
<EOS>
Nor
during
the
whole
time
of
his
stay
at
Matching
did
the
Duke
make
any
other
allusion
to
Mr.
Palliser
's
hopes
as
regarded
the
ministry
,
than
that
in
which
he
had
told
Lady
Glencora
at
the
dinner
-
table
that
her
husband
's
ambition
was
the
highest
by
which
any
man
could
be
moved
.
  
<EOS>
But
Mr.
Bott
was
sometimes
honoured
by
a
few
words
with
the
Duke
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
shall
muster
pretty
strong
,
your
Grace
,
"
Mr.
Bott
had
said
to
him
one
day
before
dinner
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
depends
on
how
the
changes
go
,
"
said
the
Duke
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
there
will
be
a
change
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
yes
;
there
'll
be
a
change
,
 
certainly
,
I
should
say
.
<EOS>
And
it
will
be
in
your
direction
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
in
Palliser
's
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
I
should
think
so
;
 
that
is
,
if
it
suits
him
.
<EOS>
By
-
the
-
by
,
Mr.
Bott
 
<EOS>
"
Then
there
was
a
little
whispered
communication
,
in
which
perhaps
Mr.
Bott
was
undertaking
some
commission
of
that
nature
which
Lady
Glencora
had
called
"
telling
.
"
   
<EOS>
In
Which
Much
of
the
History
of
the
Pallisers
Is
Told
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
end
of
ten
days
Alice
found
herself
quite
comfortable
at
Matching
Priory
.
<EOS>
She
had
now
promised
to
remain
there
till
the
second
week
of
December
,
at
which
time
she
was
to
go
to
Vavasor
Hall
,
 
there
to
meet
her
father
and
Kate
.
<EOS>
The
Pallisers
were
to
pass
their
Christmas
with
the
Duke
of
Omnium
in
Barsetshire
.
<EOS>
"
We
always
are
to
do
that
,
"
said
Glencora
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
the
state
occasion
at
Gatherum
Castle
,
but
it
only
lasts
for
one
week
.
<EOS>
Then
we
go
somewhere
else
.
<EOS>
Oh
dear
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
do
you
say
"
oh
dear
"
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Because
 
;
I
do
n't
think
I
mean
to
tell
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
I
'm
sure
I
wo
n't
ask
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
so
like
you
,
Alice
.
<EOS>
But
I
can
be
as
firm
as
you
,
and
I
'm
sure
I
wo
n't
tell
you
unless
you
do
ask
.
<EOS>
"
But
Alice
did
not
ask
,
and
it
was
not
long
before
Lady
Glencora
's
firmness
gave
way
.
  
<EOS>
But
,
as
I
have
said
,
Alice
had
become
quite
comfortable
at
Matching
Priory
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
she
was
already
growing
upwards
towards
the
light
.
<EOS>
At
any
rate
she
could
listen
with
pleasure
to
the
few
words
the
Duke
would
say
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
could
even
chat
a
little
to
the
Duchess
,
 
so
that
her
Grace
had
observed
to
Lady
Glencora
that
"
her
cousin
was
a
very
nice
person
,
 
a
very
nice
person
indeed
.
<EOS>
What
a
pity
it
was
that
she
had
been
so
ill
-
treated
by
that
gentleman
in
Oxfordshire
!
"
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
had
to
explain
that
the
gentleman
lived
in
Cambridgeshire
,
and
that
he
,
at
any
rate
,
had
not
treated
anybody
ill
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Do
you
mean
that
she
 
jilted
him
?
"
said
the
Duchess
,
almost
whistling
,
and
opening
her
eyes
very
wide
.
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
,
I
'm
sorry
for
that
.
<EOS>
I
should
n't
have
thought
it
.
"
<EOS>
And
when
she
next
spoke
to
Alice
she
assumed
rather
a
severe
tone
of
emphasis
;
 
but
this
was
soon
abandoned
when
Alice
listened
to
her
with
complacency
.
  
<EOS>
Alice
also
had
learned
to
ride
,
 
or
rather
had
resumed
her
riding
,
which
for
years
had
been
abandoned
.
<EOS>
Jeffrey
Palliser
had
been
her
squire
,
and
she
had
become
intimate
with
him
so
as
to
learn
to
quarrel
with
him
and
to
like
him
,
 
to
such
an
extent
that
Lady
Glencora
had
laughingly
told
her
that
she
was
going
to
do
more
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
rather
think
not
,
"
said
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
what
has
thinking
to
do
with
it
?
<EOS>
Who
ever
thinks
about
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
just
at
present
,
 
at
any
rate
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Upon
my
word
it
would
be
very
nice
;
 
and
then
perhaps
some
day
you
'd
be
the
Duchess
.
"
  
"
Glencora
,
do
n't
talk
such
nonsense
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Those
are
the
speculations
which
people
make
.
<EOS>
Only
I
should
spite
you
by
killing
myself
,
so
that
he
might
marry
again
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
can
you
say
such
horrid
things
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
shall
,
 
some
day
.
<EOS>
What
right
have
I
to
stand
in
his
way
?
<EOS>
He
spoke
to
me
the
other
day
about
Jeffrey
's
altered
position
,
and
I
knew
what
he
meant
;
 
or
rather
what
he
did
n't
mean
to
say
,
but
what
he
thought
.
<EOS>
But
I
sha
n't
kill
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
think
not
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
only
know
one
other
way
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
thinking
of
things
which
should
never
be
in
your
thoughts
,
"
said
Alice
vehemently
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Have
you
no
trust
in
God
's
providence
?
<EOS>
Can
not
you
accept
what
has
been
done
for
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Bott
had
gone
away
,
much
to
Lady
Glencora
's
delight
,
but
had
unfortunately
come
back
again
.
<EOS>
On
his
return
Alice
heard
more
of
the
feud
between
the
Duchess
and
Mrs.
Conway
Sparkes
.
<EOS>
"
I
did
not
tell
you
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
to
her
friend
;
 
<EOS>
"
I
did
not
tell
you
before
he
went
that
I
was
right
about
his
tale
-
bearing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
did
he
bear
tales
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
I
did
get
the
scolding
,
and
I
know
very
well
that
it
came
through
him
,
though
Mr.
Palliser
did
not
say
so
.
<EOS>
But
he
told
me
that
the
Duchess
had
felt
herself
hurt
by
that
other
woman
's
way
of
talking
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
it
was
not
your
fault
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
that
's
what
I
said
.
<EOS>
It
was
he
who
desired
me
to
ask
Mrs.
Conway
Sparkes
to
come
here
.
<EOS>
I
did
n't
want
her
.
<EOS>
She
goes
everywhere
,
and
it
is
thought
a
catch
to
get
her
;
but
if
she
had
been
drowned
in
the
Red
Sea
I
should
n't
have
minded
.
<EOS>
When
I
told
him
that
,
he
said
it
was
nonsense
,
 
which
of
course
it
was
;
and
then
he
said
I
ought
to
make
her
hold
her
tongue
.
<EOS>
Of
course
I
said
I
could
n't
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Conway
Sparkes
would
n't
care
for
me
.
<EOS>
If
she
quizzed
me
,
myself
,
I
told
him
that
I
could
take
care
of
myself
,
though
she
were
ten
times
Mrs.
Conway
Sparkes
,
and
had
written
finer
poetry
than
Tennyson
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
fine
;
 
some
of
it
,
"
said
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
dare
say
!
<EOS>
I
know
a
great
deal
of
it
by
heart
,
only
I
would
n't
give
her
the
pleasure
of
supposing
that
I
had
ever
thought
so
much
about
her
poetry
.
<EOS>
And
then
I
told
him
that
I
could
n't
take
care
of
the
Duchess
,
 
and
he
told
me
that
I
was
a
child
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
only
meant
that
in
love
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
a
child
;
I
know
that
.
<EOS>
Why
did
n't
he
marry
some
strong
-
minded
,
ferocious
woman
that
could
keep
his
house
in
order
,
and
frown
Mrs.
Sparkes
out
of
her
impudence
?
<EOS>
It
was
n't
my
fault
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
did
n't
tell
him
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
did
.
<EOS>
Then
he
kissed
me
,
and
said
it
was
all
right
,
and
told
me
that
I
should
grow
older
.
"
<EOS>
And
Mrs.
Sparkes
will
grow
more
impudent
,
"
I
said
,
"
and
the
Duchess
more
silly
.
"
<EOS>
And
after
that
I
went
away
.
<EOS>
Now
this
horrid
Mr.
Bott
has
come
back
again
,
and
only
that
it
would
be
mean
in
me
to
condescend
so
far
,
I
would
punish
him
.
<EOS>
He
grins
and
smiles
at
me
,
and
rubs
his
big
hands
more
than
ever
,
because
he
feels
that
he
has
behaved
badly
.
<EOS>
Is
it
not
horrid
to
have
to
live
in
the
house
with
such
people
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
you
need
mind
him
much
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
;
but
I
am
the
mistress
here
,
and
am
told
that
I
am
to
entertain
the
people
.
<EOS>
Fancy
entertaining
the
Duchess
of
St.
Bungay
and
Mr.
Bott
!
"
  
<EOS>
Alice
had
now
become
so
intimate
with
Lady
Glencora
that
she
did
not
scruple
to
read
her
wise
lectures
,
 
telling
her
that
she
allowed
herself
to
think
too
much
of
little
things
,
 
and
too
much
also
of
some
big
things
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
regards
Mr.
Bott
,
"
said
Alice
,
"
I
think
you
should
bear
it
as
though
there
were
no
such
person
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
But
that
would
be
pretence
,
 
especially
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
it
would
not
be
pretence
;
it
would
be
the
reticence
which
all
women
should
practise
,
 
and
you
,
in
your
position
,
more
almost
than
any
other
woman
.
"
<EOS>
Then
Lady
Glencora
pouted
,
told
Alice
that
it
was
a
pity
she
had
not
married
Mr.
Palliser
,
and
left
her
.
  
<EOS>
That
evening
,
 
the
evening
of
Mr.
Bott
's
return
to
Matching
,
that
gentleman
found
a
place
near
to
Alice
in
the
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
He
had
often
come
up
to
her
,
rubbing
his
hands
together
,
and
saying
little
words
,
as
though
there
was
some
reason
from
their
positions
that
they
two
should
be
friends
.
<EOS>
Alice
had
perceived
this
,
and
had
endeavoured
with
all
her
force
to
shake
him
off
;
but
he
was
a
man
,
who
if
he
understood
a
hint
,
never
took
it
.
<EOS>
A
cold
shoulder
was
nothing
to
him
,
if
he
wanted
to
gain
the
person
who
showed
it
him
.
<EOS>
His
code
of
perseverance
taught
him
that
it
was
a
virtue
to
overcome
cold
shoulders
.
<EOS>
The
man
or
woman
who
received
his
first
overtures
with
grace
would
probably
be
one
on
whom
it
would
be
better
that
he
should
look
down
and
waste
no
further
time
;
whereas
he
or
she
who
could
afford
to
treat
him
with
disdain
would
no
doubt
be
worth
gaining
.
<EOS>
Such
men
as
Mr.
Bott
are
ever
gracious
to
cold
shoulders
.
<EOS>
The
colder
the
shoulders
,
the
more
gracious
are
the
Mr.
Botts
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
a
delightful
person
is
our
dear
friend
,
Lady
Glencora
!
"
said
Mr.
Bott
,
having
caught
Alice
in
a
position
from
which
she
could
not
readily
escape
.
  
<EOS>
Alice
had
half
a
mind
to
differ
,
or
to
make
any
remark
that
might
rid
her
from
Mr.
Bott
.
<EOS>
But
she
did
not
dare
to
say
a
word
that
might
seem
to
have
been
said
playfully
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
indeed
,
"
she
replied
.
<EOS>
"
How
very
cold
it
is
to
-
night
!
"
<EOS>
She
was
angry
with
herself
for
her
own
stupidity
as
soon
as
the
phrase
was
out
of
her
mouth
,
and
then
she
almost
laughed
as
she
thought
of
the
Duchess
and
the
hot
-
water
pipes
at
Longroyston
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
it
is
cold
.
<EOS>
You
and
her
ladyship
are
great
friends
,
I
believe
,
Miss
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
She
is
my
cousin
,
"
said
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
yes
;
that
is
so
pleasant
.
<EOS>
I
have
reason
to
know
that
Mr.
Palliser
is
very
much
gratified
that
you
should
be
so
much
with
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
This
was
unbearable
.
<EOS>
Alice
could
not
quite
assume
sufficient
courage
to
get
up
from
her
chair
and
walk
away
from
him
,
and
yet
she
felt
that
she
must
escape
further
conversation
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
that
I
am
very
much
with
her
,
and
if
I
were
I
ca
n't
think
it
would
make
any
difference
to
Mr.
Palliser
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
But
Mr.
Bott
was
not
a
man
to
be
put
down
when
he
had
a
purpose
in
hand
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
assure
you
that
those
are
his
sentiments
.
<EOS>
Of
course
we
all
know
that
dear
Lady
Glencora
is
young
.
<EOS>
She
is
very
young
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Bott
,
I
really
would
rather
not
talk
about
my
cousin
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
dear
Miss
Vavasor
;
 
when
we
both
have
her
welfare
in
view
 
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
n't
her
welfare
in
view
,
Mr.
Bott
;
not
in
the
least
.
<EOS>
There
is
no
reason
why
I
should
.
<EOS>
You
must
excuse
me
if
I
say
I
can
not
talk
about
her
welfare
with
a
perfect
stranger
.
<EOS>
"
Then
she
did
get
up
,
and
went
away
from
the
Member
of
Parliament
,
leaving
him
rather
astonished
at
her
audacity
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
a
constant
man
,
and
his
inner
resolve
was
simply
to
the
effect
that
he
would
try
it
again
.
  
<EOS>
I
wonder
whether
Jeffrey
Palliser
did
think
much
of
the
difference
between
his
present
position
and
that
which
would
have
been
his
had
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
been
the
happy
possessor
of
a
cradle
up
-
stairs
with
a
boy
in
it
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
he
must
have
done
so
.
<EOS>
It
is
hardly
possible
that
any
man
should
not
be
alive
to
the
importance
of
such
a
chance
.
<EOS>
His
own
present
position
was
one
of
the
most
unfortunate
which
can
fall
to
the
lot
of
a
man
.
<EOS>
His
father
,
the
Duke
's
youngest
brother
,
had
left
him
about
six
hundred
a
year
,
and
had
left
him
also
a
taste
for
living
with
people
of
six
thousand
.
<EOS>
The
propriety
of
earning
his
bread
had
never
been
put
before
him
.
<EOS>
His
father
had
been
in
Parliament
,
and
had
been
the
most
favoured
son
of
the
old
Duke
,
who
for
some
years
before
his
death
had
never
spoken
to
him
who
now
reigned
over
the
house
of
the
Pallisers
.
<EOS>
Jeffrey
's
father
had
been
brought
up
at
Matching
Priory
as
scions
of
ducal
houses
are
brought
up
,
and
on
the
old
man
's
death
had
been
possessed
of
means
sufficient
to
go
on
in
the
same
path
,
though
with
difficulty
.
<EOS>
His
brother
had
done
something
for
him
,
and
at
various
times
he
had
held
some
place
near
the
throne
.
<EOS>
But
on
his
death
,
when
the
property
left
behind
him
was
divided
between
his
son
and
three
daughters
,
Jeffrey
Palliser
became
possessed
of
the
income
above
stated
.
<EOS>
Of
course
he
could
live
on
it
,
 
and
as
during
the
winter
months
of
the
year
a
home
was
found
for
him
free
of
cost
,
he
could
keep
hunters
,
and
live
as
rich
men
live
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
a
poor
,
embarrassed
man
,
without
prospects
,
 
until
this
fine
ducal
prospect
became
opened
to
him
by
the
want
of
that
cradle
at
Matching
Priory
.
  
<EOS>
But
the
prospect
was
no
doubt
very
distant
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
might
yet
have
as
many
sons
as
Hecuba
.
<EOS>
Or
she
might
die
,
and
some
other
more
fortunate
lady
might
become
the
mother
of
his
cousin
's
heir
.
<EOS>
Or
the
Duke
might
marry
and
have
a
son
.
<EOS>
And
,
moreover
,
his
cousin
was
only
one
year
older
than
himself
,
and
the
great
prize
,
if
it
came
his
way
,
might
not
come
for
forty
years
as
yet
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
his
hand
might
now
be
acceptable
in
quarters
where
it
would
certainly
be
rejected
had
Lady
Glencora
possessed
that
cradle
up
-
stairs
.
<EOS>
We
can
not
but
suppose
that
he
must
have
made
some
calculations
of
this
nature
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
pity
you
should
do
nothing
all
your
life
,
"
his
cousin
Plantagenet
said
to
him
one
morning
just
at
this
time
.
<EOS>
Jeffrey
had
sought
the
interview
in
his
cousin
's
room
,
and
I
fear
had
done
so
with
some
slight
request
for
ready
money
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
am
I
to
do
?
"
said
Jeffrey
.
  
<EOS>
"
At
any
rate
you
might
marry
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
yes
;
 
I
could
marry
.
<EOS>
There
's
no
man
so
poor
but
what
he
can
do
that
.
<EOS>
The
question
would
be
how
I
might
like
the
subsequent
starvation
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
see
that
you
need
starve
.
<EOS>
Though
your
own
fortune
is
small
,
it
is
something
,
 
and
many
girls
have
fortunes
of
their
own
.
"
  
<EOS>
Jeffrey
thought
of
Lady
Glencora
,
but
he
made
no
allusion
to
her
in
speech
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
I
'm
very
good
at
that
kind
of
thing
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
When
the
father
and
mother
came
to
ask
of
my
house
and
my
home
<EOS>
I
should
break
down
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
say
it
as
praising
myself
;
 
indeed
,
quite
the
reverse
;
but
I
fear
I
have
not
a
mercenary
tendency
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
nonsense
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
yes
;
quite
so
.
<EOS>
I
admit
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Men
must
have
mercenary
tendencies
or
they
would
not
have
bread
.
<EOS>
The
man
who
ploughs
that
he
may
live
does
so
because
he
,
luckily
,
has
a
mercenary
tendency
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Just
so
.
<EOS>
But
you
see
I
am
less
lucky
than
the
ploughman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
no
vulgar
error
so
vulgar
,
 
<EOS>
that
is
to
say
,
common
or
erroneous
,
as
that
by
which
men
have
been
taught
to
say
that
mercenary
tendencies
are
bad
.
<EOS>
A
desire
for
wealth
is
the
source
of
all
progress
.
<EOS>
Civilization
comes
from
what
men
call
greed
.
<EOS>
Let
your
mercenary
tendencies
be
combined
with
honesty
and
they
can
not
take
you
astray
.
<EOS>
"
This
the
future
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
said
with
much
of
that
air
and
tone
of
wisdom
which
a
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
ought
to
possess
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
have
n't
got
any
such
tendencies
,
"
said
Jeffrey
.
  
<EOS>
"
Would
you
like
to
occupy
a
farm
in
Scotland
?
"
said
Plantagenet
Palliser
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
pay
rent
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
would
have
to
pay
rent
of
course
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
no
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
dishonest
,
as
I
know
I
should
never
pay
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
too
old
,
I
fear
,
for
the
public
service
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
mean
a
desk
in
the
Treasury
,
 
with
a
hundred
a
year
.
<EOS>
Yes
;
I
think
I
am
too
old
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
have
you
no
plan
of
your
own
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
much
of
one
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
I
have
thought
I
would
go
to
New
Zealand
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
would
have
to
be
a
farmer
there
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
 
I
should
n't
do
that
.
<EOS>
I
should
get
up
an
opposition
to
the
Government
and
that
sort
of
thing
,
and
then
they
would
buy
me
off
and
give
me
a
place
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
does
very
well
here
,
Jeffrey
,
if
a
man
can
get
into
Parliament
and
has
capital
enough
to
wait
;
but
I
do
n't
think
it
would
do
out
there
.
<EOS>
Would
you
like
to
go
into
Parliament
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
;
here
?
<EOS>
Of
course
I
should
.
<EOS>
Only
I
should
be
sure
to
get
terribly
into
debt
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
owe
very
much
,
now
,
 
not
to
speak
of
,
 
except
what
I
owe
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
owe
nothing
to
me
,
"
said
Plantagenet
,
with
some
little
touch
of
magniloquence
in
his
tone
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
;
do
n't
speak
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
brother
,
and
between
you
and
me
<EOS>
it
means
nothing
.
<EOS>
You
see
,
Jeffrey
,
it
may
be
that
I
shall
have
to
look
to
you
as
my
 
my
 
my
heir
,
in
short
.
"
<EOS>
Hereupon
Jeffrey
muttered
something
as
to
the
small
probability
of
such
necessity
,
and
as
to
the
great
remoteness
of
any
result
even
if
it
were
so
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
all
true
,
"
said
the
elder
heir
of
the
Pallisers
,
"
but
still
 
.
<EOS>
In
short
,
I
wish
you
would
do
something
.
<EOS>
Do
you
think
about
it
;
and
then
some
day
speak
to
me
again
.
"
  
<EOS>
Jeffrey
,
as
he
left
his
cousin
with
a
cheque
for
£
500
in
his
waist
-
coat
pocket
,
thought
that
the
interview
which
had
at
one
time
taken
important
dimensions
,
had
not
been
concluded
altogether
satisfactorily
.
<EOS>
A
seat
in
Parliament
!
<EOS>
Yes
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
If
his
cousin
would
so
far
use
his
political
,
monetary
,
or
ducal
interest
as
to
do
that
for
him
;
 
as
to
give
him
something
of
the
status
properly
belonging
to
the
younger
son
of
the
House
,
then
indeed
life
would
have
some
charms
for
him
!
<EOS>
But
as
for
the
farm
in
Scotland
,
or
a
desk
at
an
office
in
London
,
 
his
own
New
Zealand
plan
would
be
better
than
those
.
<EOS>
And
then
as
he
went
along
of
course
he
bethought
himself
that
it
might
be
his
lot
yet
to
die
,
and
at
least
to
be
buried
,
in
the
purple
,
as
a
Duke
of
Omnium
.
<EOS>
If
so
,
certainly
it
would
be
his
duty
to
prepare
another
heir
,
and
leave
a
duke
behind
him
,
 
if
it
were
possible
.
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
going
to
ride
with
us
after
lunch
?
"
said
Lady
Glencora
to
him
as
he
strolled
into
the
drawing
-
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Jeffrey
;
"
I
'm
going
to
study
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
To
do
what
?
"
said
Lady
Glencora
.
  
<EOS>
"
To
study
;
 
or
rather
I
shall
spend
to
-
day
in
sitting
down
and
considering
what
I
will
study
.
<EOS>
My
cousin
has
just
been
telling
me
that
I
ought
to
do
something
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
So
you
ought
,
"
said
Iphigenia
energetically
from
her
writing
-
desk
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
he
did
n't
seem
to
have
any
clear
opinion
what
it
ought
to
be
.
<EOS>
You
see
there
ca
n't
be
two
Chancellors
of
the
Exchequer
at
the
same
time
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Sparkes
,
what
ought
a
young
man
like
me
to
set
about
doing
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Go
into
Parliament
,
I
should
say
,
"
said
Mrs.
Sparkes
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
yes
;
exactly
.
<EOS>
He
had
some
notion
of
that
kind
,
too
,
but
he
did
n't
name
any
particular
place
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
'll
try
the
City
of
London
.
<EOS>
They
've
four
there
,
and
of
course
the
chance
of
getting
in
would
thereby
be
doubled
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
thought
that
commercial
men
were
generally
preferred
in
the
City
,
"
said
the
Duchess
,
taking
a
strong
and
good
-
natured
interest
in
the
matter
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Palliser
means
to
make
a
fortune
in
trade
as
a
preliminary
,
"
said
Mrs.
Sparkes
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
he
meant
anything
of
the
kind
,
"
said
the
Duchess
.
  
<EOS>
"
At
any
rate
I
have
got
to
do
something
,
so
I
ca
n't
go
and
ride
,
"
said
Jeffrey
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
ought
to
do
something
,
"
said
Iphigenia
from
her
desk
.
  
<EOS>
Twice
during
this
little
conversation
Lady
Glencora
had
looked
up
,
catching
Alice
's
eye
,
and
Alice
had
well
known
what
she
had
meant
.
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
"
the
glance
had
said
,
"
Plantagenet
is
beginning
to
take
an
interest
in
his
cousin
,
and
you
know
why
.
<EOS>
The
man
who
is
to
be
the
father
of
the
future
dukes
must
not
be
allowed
to
fritter
away
his
time
in
obscurity
.
<EOS>
Had
I
that
cradle
up
-
stairs
Jeffrey
might
be
as
idle
as
he
pleased
.
<EOS>
"
Alice
understood
it
well
.
  
<EOS>
Of
course
Jeffrey
did
join
the
riding
party
.
<EOS>
"
What
is
a
man
like
me
to
do
who
wants
to
do
something
?
"
he
said
to
Alice
.
<EOS>
Alice
was
quite
aware
that
Lady
Glencora
had
contrived
some
little
scheme
that
Mr.
Palliser
should
be
riding
next
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
liked
Mr.
Palliser
,
and
therefore
had
no
objection
;
but
she
declared
to
herself
that
her
cousin
was
a
goose
for
her
pains
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Sparkes
says
you
ought
to
go
into
Parliament
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
 
and
the
dear
Duchess
would
perhaps
suggest
a
house
in
Belgrave
Square
.
<EOS>
I
want
to
hear
your
advice
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
only
say
ditto
to
Miss
Palliser
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
!
<EOS>
Iphy
?
<EOS>
About
procrastination
?
<EOS>
But
you
see
the
more
of
my
time
he
steals
the
better
it
is
for
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
the
evil
you
have
got
to
cure
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
cousin
Plantagenet
suggested
 
marriage
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
very
good
thing
too
,
I
'm
sure
,
"
said
Alice
;
"
<EOS>
only
it
depends
something
on
the
sort
of
wife
you
get
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
mean
,
of
course
,
how
much
money
she
has
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Not
altogether
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Looking
at
it
from
my
cousin
's
point
of
view
,
I
suppose
that
it
is
the
only
important
point
.
<EOS>
Who
are
there
coming
up
this
year
,
 
in
the
way
of
heiresses
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
word
I
do
n't
know
.
<EOS>
In
the
first
place
,
how
much
money
makes
an
heiress
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
For
such
a
fellow
as
me
,
I
suppose
ten
thousand
pounds
ought
to
do
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
not
much
,
"
said
Alice
,
who
had
exactly
that
amount
of
her
own
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
 
;
perhaps
that
's
too
moderate
.
<EOS>
But
the
lower
one
went
in
the
money
speculation
,
the
greater
would
be
the
number
to
choose
from
,
and
the
better
the
chance
of
getting
something
decent
in
the
woman
herself
.
<EOS>
I
have
something
of
my
own
,
 
not
much
you
know
;
so
with
the
lady
's
ten
thousand
pounds
we
might
be
able
to
live
,
 
in
some
second
-
rate
French
town
perhaps
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
do
n't
see
what
you
would
gain
by
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
people
here
would
have
got
rid
of
me
.
<EOS>
That
seems
to
be
the
great
thing
.
<EOS>
If
you
hear
of
any
girl
with
about
that
sum
,
moderately
good
-
looking
,
not
too
young
so
that
she
might
know
something
of
the
world
,
decently
born
,
and
able
to
read
and
write
,
perhaps
you
will
bear
me
in
mind
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
will
,
"
said
Alice
,
who
was
quite
aware
that
he
had
made
an
accurate
picture
of
her
own
position
.
<EOS>
"
When
I
meet
such
a
one
,
I
will
send
for
you
at
once
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
no
such
person
now
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
no
;
not
just
at
present
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
declare
I
do
n't
think
he
could
do
anything
better
,
"
her
cousin
said
to
her
that
night
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
was
now
in
the
habit
of
having
Alice
with
her
in
what
she
called
her
dressing
-
room
every
evening
,
and
then
they
would
sit
till
the
small
hours
came
upon
them
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
always
burnt
the
midnight
oil
and
came
to
bed
with
the
owls
.
<EOS>
They
would
often
talk
of
him
and
his
prospects
till
Alice
had
perhaps
inspired
his
wife
with
more
of
interest
in
him
and
them
than
she
had
before
felt
.
<EOS>
And
Alice
had
managed
generally
to
drive
her
friend
away
from
those
topics
which
were
so
dangerous
,
 
those
allusions
to
her
childlessness
,
and
those
hints
that
Burgo
Fitzgerald
was
still
in
her
thoughts
.
<EOS>
And
sometimes
,
of
course
,
they
had
spoken
of
Alice
's
own
prospects
,
till
she
got
into
a
way
of
telling
her
cousin
freely
all
that
she
felt
.
<EOS>
On
such
occasions
Lady
Glencora
would
always
tell
her
that
she
had
been
right
,
 
if
she
did
not
love
the
man
.
"
<EOS>
Though
your
finger
were
put
out
for
the
ring
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
on
one
such
occasion
,
"
you
should
go
back
,
if
you
did
not
love
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
did
love
him
,
"
said
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
I
do
n't
understand
it
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
;
and
,
in
truth
,
close
as
was
their
intimacy
,
they
did
not
perfectly
understand
each
other
.
  
<EOS>
But
on
this
occasion
they
were
speaking
of
Jeffrey
Palliser
.
<EOS>
"
I
declare
I
do
n't
think
he
could
do
any
better
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
talk
such
nonsense
,
I
will
not
stay
,
"
said
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
why
should
it
be
nonsense
?
<EOS>
You
would
be
very
comfortable
with
your
joint
incomes
.
<EOS>
He
is
one
of
the
best
fellows
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
It
is
clear
that
he
likes
you
;
and
then
we
should
be
so
near
to
each
other
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
Mr.
Palliser
would
do
something
for
him
if
he
married
,
 
and
especially
if
I
asked
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
only
know
of
two
things
against
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
are
they
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
he
would
not
take
me
for
his
wife
,
and
that
I
would
not
take
him
for
my
husband
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
not
?
<EOS>
What
do
you
dislike
in
him
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
dislike
him
at
all
.
<EOS>
I
like
him
very
much
indeed
.
<EOS>
But
one
ca
n't
marry
all
the
people
one
likes
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
what
reason
is
there
why
you
should
n't
marry
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
This
chiefly
,
"
said
Alice
,
after
a
pause
;
"
that
I
have
just
separated
myself
from
a
man
whom
I
certainly
did
love
truly
,
and
that
I
can
not
transfer
my
affections
quite
so
quickly
as
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
As
soon
as
the
words
were
out
of
her
mouth
she
knew
that
they
should
not
have
been
spoken
.
<EOS>
It
was
exactly
what
Glencora
had
done
.
<EOS>
She
had
loved
a
man
and
had
separated
herself
from
him
and
had
married
another
all
within
a
month
or
two
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
first
became
red
as
fire
over
her
whole
face
and
shoulders
,
and
Alice
afterwards
did
the
same
as
she
looked
up
,
as
though
searching
in
her
cousin
's
eyes
for
pardon
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
an
unmaidenly
thing
to
do
,
certainly
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
very
slowly
,
and
in
her
lowest
voice
.
"
<EOS>
Nay
,
it
is
unwomanly
;
but
one
may
be
driven
.
<EOS>
One
may
be
so
driven
that
all
gentleness
of
womanhood
is
driven
out
of
one
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Glencora
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
not
propose
that
you
should
do
it
as
a
sudden
thing
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Glencora
!
"
  
"
I
did
do
it
suddenly
.
<EOS>
I
know
it
.
<EOS>
I
did
it
like
a
beast
that
is
driven
as
its
owner
chooses
.
<EOS>
I
know
it
.
<EOS>
I
was
a
beast
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
Alice
,
if
you
know
how
I
hate
myself
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
love
you
with
all
my
heart
,
"
said
Alice
.
<EOS>
"
Glencora
,
I
have
learned
to
love
you
so
dearly
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
you
are
the
only
being
that
does
.
<EOS>
He
ca
n't
love
me
.
<EOS>
How
is
it
possible
?
<EOS>
You
,
 
and
perhaps
another
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
are
many
who
love
you
.
<EOS>
He
loves
you
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
loves
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
impossible
.
<EOS>
I
have
never
said
a
word
to
him
that
could
make
him
love
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
never
done
a
thing
for
him
that
can
make
him
love
me
.
<EOS>
The
mother
of
his
child
he
might
have
loved
,
because
of
that
.
<EOS>
Why
should
he
love
me
?
<EOS>
We
were
told
to
marry
each
other
and
did
it
.
<EOS>
When
could
he
have
learned
to
love
me
?
<EOS>
But
,
Alice
,
he
requires
no
loving
,
either
to
take
it
or
to
give
it
.
<EOS>
I
wish
it
were
so
with
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Alice
said
what
she
could
to
comfort
her
,
but
her
words
were
but
of
little
avail
as
regarded
those
marriage
sorrows
.
  
<EOS>
"
Forgive
you
!
"
<EOS>
at
last
Glencora
said
.
<EOS>
"
What
have
I
to
forgive
?
<EOS>
You
do
n't
suppose
I
do
not
know
it
all
,
and
think
of
it
all
without
the
chance
of
some
stray
word
like
that
!
<EOS>
Forgive
you
!
<EOS>
I
am
so
grateful
that
you
love
me
!
<EOS>
Some
one
's
love
<EOS>
I
must
have
found
,
 
or
I
could
not
have
remained
here
.
"
   
<EOS>
Lady
Midlothian
.
 
<EOS>
A
week
or
ten
days
after
this
,
Alice
,
when
she
came
down
to
the
breakfast
-
parlour
one
morning
,
found
herself
alone
with
Mr.
Bott
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
fashion
at
Matching
Priory
for
people
to
assemble
rather
late
in
the
day
.
<EOS>
The
nominal
hour
for
breakfast
was
ten
,
and
none
of
the
ladies
of
the
party
were
ever
seen
before
that
.
<EOS>
Some
of
the
gentlemen
would
breakfast
earlier
,
especially
on
hunting
mornings
;
and
on
some
occasions
the
ladies
,
when
they
came
together
,
would
find
themselves
altogether
deserted
by
their
husbands
and
brothers
.
<EOS>
On
this
day
it
was
fated
that
Mr.
Bott
alone
should
represent
the
sterner
sex
,
and
when
Alice
entered
the
room
he
was
standing
on
the
rug
with
his
back
to
the
fire
,
waiting
till
the
appearance
of
some
other
guest
should
give
him
the
sanction
necessary
for
the
commencement
of
his
morning
meal
.
<EOS>
Alice
,
when
she
saw
him
,
would
have
retreated
had
it
been
possible
,
for
she
had
learned
to
dislike
him
greatly
,
and
was
,
indeed
,
almost
afraid
of
him
;
but
she
could
not
do
so
without
making
her
flight
too
conspicuous
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
intend
to
prolong
your
stay
here
,
Miss
Vavasor
?
"
said
Mr.
Bott
,
taking
advantage
of
the
first
moment
at
which
she
looked
up
from
a
letter
which
she
was
reading
.
  
<EOS>
"
For
a
few
more
days
,
I
think
,
"
said
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
 
I
'm
glad
of
that
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
has
pressed
me
so
much
to
remain
till
he
goes
to
the
Duke
's
,
that
I
can
not
get
away
sooner
.
<EOS>
As
I
am
an
unmarried
man
myself
,
I
can
employ
my
time
as
well
in
one
place
as
in
another
;
 
at
this
time
of
the
year
at
least
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
find
that
very
convenient
,
"
said
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
it
is
convenient
.
<EOS>
You
see
in
my
position
,
 
Parliamentary
position
,
I
mean
,
 
I
am
obliged
,
as
a
public
man
,
to
act
in
concert
with
others
.
<EOS>
A
public
man
can
be
of
no
service
unless
he
is
prepared
to
do
that
.
<EOS>
We
must
give
and
take
,
you
know
,
Miss
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
As
Miss
Vavasor
made
no
remark
in
answer
to
this
,
Mr.
Bott
continued
 
<EOS>
"
I
always
say
to
the
men
of
my
party
,
 
<EOS>
of
course
I
regard
myself
as
belonging
to
the
extreme
Radicals
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
indeed
!
"
said
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
I
came
into
Parliament
on
that
understanding
;
and
I
have
never
seen
any
occasion
as
yet
to
change
any
political
opinion
that
I
have
expressed
.
<EOS>
But
I
always
say
to
the
gentlemen
with
whom
I
act
,
that
nothing
can
be
done
if
we
do
n't
give
and
take
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
mind
saying
to
you
,
Miss
Vavasor
,
that
I
look
upon
our
friend
,
Mr.
Palliser
,
as
the
most
rising
public
man
in
the
country
.
<EOS>
I
do
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
happy
to
hear
you
say
so
,
"
said
his
victim
,
who
found
herself
driven
to
make
some
remark
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
I
,
as
an
extreme
Radical
,
do
not
think
I
can
serve
my
party
better
than
by
keeping
in
the
same
boat
with
him
,
as
long
as
it
will
hold
the
two
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
'll
make
a
Government
hack
of
you
,
"
a
friend
of
mine
said
to
me
the
other
day
.
"
<EOS>
And
I
'll
make
a
Manchester
school
Prime
Minister
of
him
,
"
I
replied
.
<EOS>
I
rather
think
I
know
what
I
'm
about
,
Miss
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
No
doubt
,
"
said
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
so
does
he
;
 
and
so
does
he
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
is
not
the
man
to
be
led
by
the
nose
by
any
one
.
<EOS>
But
it
's
a
fair
system
of
give
and
take
.
<EOS>
You
ca
n't
get
on
in
politics
without
it
.
<EOS>
What
a
charming
woman
is
your
relative
,
Lady
Glencowrer
!
<EOS>
I
remember
well
what
you
said
to
me
the
other
evening
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
you
?
"
said
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
quite
agree
with
you
that
confidential
intercourse
regarding
dear
friends
should
not
be
lightly
made
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Certainly
not
,
"
said
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
there
are
occasions
,
Miss
Vavasor
;
there
are
occasions
when
the
ordinary
laws
by
which
we
govern
our
social
conduct
must
be
made
somewhat
elastic
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
this
one
of
them
,
Mr.
Bott
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
it
not
?
<EOS>
Just
listen
to
me
for
one
moment
,
Miss
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
Our
friend
,
Mr.
Palliser
,
I
am
proud
to
say
,
relies
much
upon
my
humble
friendship
.
<EOS>
Our
first
connection
has
,
of
course
,
been
political
;
but
it
has
extended
beyond
that
,
and
has
become
pleasantly
social
;
 
I
may
say
,
very
pleasantly
social
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
a
taste
Mr.
Palliser
must
have
!
"
<EOS>
Alice
thought
to
herself
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
need
not
tell
you
that
Lady
Glencowrer
is
 
very
young
;
we
may
say
,
very
young
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Bott
,
I
will
not
talk
to
you
about
Lady
Glencora
Palliser
.
"
  
<EOS>
This
Alice
said
in
a
determined
voice
,
and
with
all
the
power
of
resistance
at
her
command
.
<EOS>
She
frowned
too
,
and
looked
savagely
at
Mr.
Bott
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
a
man
of
considerable
courage
,
and
knew
how
to
bear
such
opposition
without
flinching
.
  
<EOS>
"
When
I
tell
you
,
Miss
Vavasor
,
that
I
speak
solely
with
a
view
to
her
domestic
happiness
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
that
she
wishes
to
have
any
such
guardian
of
her
happiness
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
if
he
wishes
it
,
Miss
Vavasor
!
<EOS>
Now
I
have
the
means
of
knowing
that
he
has
the
greatest
reliance
on
your
judgement
.
"
  
<EOS>
Hereupon
Alice
got
up
with
the
intention
of
leaving
the
room
,
but
she
was
met
at
the
door
by
Mrs.
Conway
Sparkes
.
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
running
from
your
breakfast
,
Miss
Vavasor
?
"
said
she
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
Mrs.
Sparkes
;
I
am
running
from
Mr.
Bott
,
"
said
Alice
,
who
was
almost
beside
herself
with
anger
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Bott
,
what
is
this
?
"
said
Mrs.
Sparkes
.
<EOS>
"
Ha
,
ha
,
ha
,
"
laughed
Mr.
Bott
.
  
<EOS>
Alice
returned
to
the
room
,
and
Mrs.
Sparkes
immediately
saw
that
she
had
in
truth
been
running
from
Mr.
Bott
.
<EOS>
"
I
hope
I
shall
be
able
to
keep
the
peace
,
"
said
she
.
<EOS>
"
I
trust
his
offence
was
not
one
that
requires
special
punishment
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Ha
,
ha
,
ha
,
"
again
laughed
Mr.
Bott
,
who
rather
liked
his
position
.
  
<EOS>
Alice
was
very
angry
with
herself
,
feeling
that
she
had
told
more
of
the
truth
to
Mrs.
Sparkes
than
she
should
have
done
,
unless
she
was
prepared
to
tell
the
whole
.
<EOS>
As
it
was
,
she
wanted
to
say
something
,
and
did
not
know
what
to
say
;
but
her
confusion
was
at
once
stopped
by
the
entrance
of
Lady
Glencora
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Sparkes
,
good
morning
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
"
I
hope
nobody
has
waited
breakfast
.
<EOS>
Good
morning
,
Mr.
Bott
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
Alice
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
the
matter
?
"
said
Alice
,
going
up
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Alice
,
such
a
blow
!
"
<EOS>
But
Alice
could
see
that
her
cousin
was
not
quite
in
earnest
;
 
that
the
new
trouble
,
though
it
might
be
vexatious
,
was
no
great
calamity
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Come
here
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
;
and
they
both
went
into
an
embrasure
of
the
window
.
<EOS>
"
Now
I
shall
have
to
put
your
confidence
in
me
to
the
test
.
<EOS>
This
letter
is
from
,
 
whom
do
you
think
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
can
I
guess
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
From
Lady
Midlothian
!
<EOS>
and
she
's
coming
here
on
Monday
,
on
her
road
to
London
.
<EOS>
Unless
you
tell
me
that
you
are
quite
sure
this
is
as
unexpected
by
me
as
by
you
,
I
will
never
speak
to
you
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
quite
sure
of
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
then
we
can
consult
.
<EOS>
But
first
we
'll
go
and
have
some
breakfast
.
"
<EOS>
Then
more
ladies
swarmed
into
the
room
,
 
the
Duchess
and
her
daughter
,
and
the
two
Miss
Pallisers
,
and
others
;
and
Mr.
Bott
had
his
hands
full
in
attending
,
 
or
rather
in
offering
to
attend
,
to
their
little
wants
.
  
<EOS>
The
morning
was
nearly
gone
before
Alice
and
her
cousin
had
any
further
opportunity
of
discussing
in
private
the
approach
of
Lady
Midlothian
;
but
Mr.
Palliser
had
come
in
among
them
,
and
had
been
told
of
the
good
thing
which
was
in
store
for
him
.
<EOS>
"
We
shall
be
delighted
to
see
Lady
Midlothian
,
"
said
Mr.
Palliser
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
there
is
somebody
here
who
will
not
be
at
all
delighted
to
see
her
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
to
her
husband
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
there
,
indeed
?
"
said
he
.
<EOS>
"
Who
is
that
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Her
most
undutiful
cousin
,
Alice
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
But
,
Alice
,
Mr.
Palliser
knows
nothing
about
it
,
and
it
is
too
long
to
explain
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
extremely
sorry
 
<EOS>
"
began
Mr.
Palliser
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
assure
you
it
does
not
signify
in
the
least
,
"
said
Alice
.
<EOS>
"
It
will
only
be
taking
me
away
three
days
earlier
.
"
  
<EOS>
Upon
hearing
this
Mr.
Palliser
looked
very
serious
.
<EOS>
What
quarrel
could
Miss
Vavasor
have
had
with
Lady
Midlothian
which
should
make
it
impossible
for
them
to
be
visitors
at
the
same
house
?
  
<EOS>
"
It
will
do
no
such
thing
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
"
Do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
are
coward
enough
to
run
away
from
her
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
afraid
,
Miss
Vavasor
,
that
we
can
hardly
bid
her
not
come
,
"
said
Mr.
Palliser
.
<EOS>
In
answer
to
this
,
Alice
protested
that
she
would
not
for
worlds
have
been
the
means
of
keeping
Lady
Midlothian
away
from
Matching
.
<EOS>
"
I
should
tell
you
,
Mr.
Palliser
,
that
I
have
never
seen
Lady
Midlothian
,
though
she
is
my
far
-
away
cousin
.
<EOS>
Nor
have
I
ever
quarrelled
with
her
.
<EOS>
But
she
has
given
me
advice
by
letter
,
and
I
did
not
answer
her
because
I
thought
she
had
no
business
to
interfere
.
<EOS>
I
shall
go
away
,
not
because
I
am
afraid
of
her
,
but
because
,
after
what
has
passed
,
our
meeting
would
be
unpleasant
to
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
could
tell
her
that
Miss
Vavasor
is
here
,
"
said
Mr.
Palliser
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
then
she
need
not
come
unless
she
pleased
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
matter
was
so
managed
at
last
that
Alice
found
herself
unable
to
leave
Matching
without
making
more
of
Lady
Midlothian
's
coming
than
it
was
worth
.
<EOS>
It
would
undoubtedly
be
very
disagreeable
,
 
this
unexpected
meeting
with
her
relative
;
but
,
as
Lady
Glencora
said
,
Lady
Midlothian
would
not
eat
her
.
<EOS>
In
truth
,
she
felt
ashamed
of
herself
in
that
she
was
afraid
of
her
relative
.
<EOS>
No
doubt
she
was
afraid
of
her
.
<EOS>
So
much
she
was
forced
to
admit
to
herself
.
<EOS>
But
she
resolved
at
last
that
she
would
not
let
her
drive
her
out
of
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
Mr.
Bott
an
admirer
of
your
cousin
?
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Sparkes
said
that
evening
to
Lady
Glencora
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
very
distant
one
I
should
think
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
.
  
<EOS>
"
Goodness
gracious
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
an
old
lady
who
had
been
rather
awed
by
Alice
's
intimacy
and
cousinship
with
Lady
Glencora
;
"
it
's
the
very
last
thing
I
should
have
dreamt
of
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
did
n't
dream
it
,
first
or
last
,
"
said
Mrs.
Sparkes
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
do
you
ask
?
"
said
Lady
Glencora
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
suppose
that
I
am
asking
whether
Miss
Vavasor
is
an
admirer
of
his
,
"
said
Mrs.
Sparkes
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
suspicion
of
that
nature
.
<EOS>
I
rather
think
that
when
he
plays
Bacchus
she
plays
Ariadne
,
with
full
intention
of
flying
from
him
in
earnest
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
Mr.
Bott
inclined
to
play
Bacchus
?
"
asked
Lady
Glencora
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
rather
thought
he
was
this
morning
.
<EOS>
If
you
observe
,
he
has
something
of
a
godlike
and
triumphant
air
about
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
his
godship
will
triumph
there
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
really
think
she
would
be
throwing
herself
very
much
away
,
"
said
the
old
lady
.
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Vavasor
is
not
at
all
disposed
to
do
that
,
"
said
Mrs.
Sparkes
.
<EOS>
Then
that
conversation
was
allowed
to
drop
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
following
Monday
,
Lady
Midlothian
arrived
.
<EOS>
The
carriage
was
sent
to
meet
her
at
the
station
about
three
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
,
and
Alice
had
to
choose
whether
she
would
undergo
her
first
introduction
immediately
on
her
relative
's
arrival
,
or
whether
she
would
keep
herself
out
of
the
way
till
she
should
meet
her
in
the
drawing
-
room
before
dinner
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
receive
her
when
she
comes
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
,
"
and
of
course
will
tell
her
that
you
are
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Yes
,
that
will
be
best
;
and
 
;
dear
me
,
I
declare
I
do
n't
know
how
to
manage
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
bring
her
to
you
in
my
room
if
you
like
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
that
would
be
too
solemn
,
"
said
Alice
.
<EOS>
"
That
would
make
her
understand
that
I
thought
a
great
deal
about
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
we
'll
let
things
take
their
chance
,
and
you
shall
come
across
her
just
as
you
would
any
other
stranger
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
settled
at
last
that
this
would
be
the
better
course
,
but
that
Lady
Midlothian
was
to
be
informed
of
Alice
's
presence
at
the
Priory
as
soon
as
she
should
arrive
.
  
<EOS>
Alice
was
in
her
own
room
when
the
carriage
in
which
sat
the
unwelcome
old
lady
was
driven
up
to
the
hall
-
door
.
<EOS>
She
heard
the
wheels
plainly
,
and
knew
well
that
her
enemy
was
within
the
house
.
<EOS>
She
had
striven
hard
all
the
morning
to
make
herself
feel
indifferent
to
this
arrival
,
but
had
not
succeeded
;
and
was
angry
with
herself
at
finding
that
she
sat
up
-
stairs
with
an
anxious
heart
,
because
she
knew
that
her
cousin
was
in
the
room
down
-
stairs
.
<EOS>
What
was
Lady
Midlothian
to
her
that
she
should
be
afraid
of
her
?
<EOS>
And
yet
she
was
very
much
afraid
of
Lady
Midlothian
.
<EOS>
She
questioned
herself
on
the
subject
over
and
over
again
,
and
found
herself
bound
to
admit
that
such
was
the
fact
.
<EOS>
At
last
,
about
five
o'clock
,
having
reasoned
much
with
herself
,
and
rebuked
herself
for
her
own
timidity
,
she
descended
into
the
drawing
-
room
,
 
Lady
Glencora
having
promised
that
she
would
at
that
hour
be
there
,
 
and
on
opening
the
door
became
immediately
conscious
that
she
was
in
the
presence
of
her
august
relative
.
<EOS>
There
sat
Lady
Midlothian
in
a
great
chair
opposite
the
fire
,
and
Lady
Glencora
sat
near
to
her
on
a
stool
.
<EOS>
One
of
the
Miss
Pallisers
was
reading
in
a
further
part
of
the
room
,
and
there
was
no
one
else
present
in
the
chamber
.
  
<EOS>
The
Countess
of
Midlothian
was
a
very
little
woman
,
between
sixty
and
seventy
years
of
age
,
who
must
have
been
very
pretty
in
her
youth
.
<EOS>
At
present
she
made
no
pretension
either
to
youth
or
beauty
,
 
as
some
ladies
above
sixty
will
still
do
,
 
but
sat
confessedly
an
old
woman
in
all
her
external
relations
.
<EOS>
She
wore
a
round
bonnet
which
came
much
over
her
face
,
 
being
accustomed
to
continue
the
use
of
her
bonnet
till
dinner
time
when
once
she
had
been
forced
by
circumstances
to
put
it
on
.
<EOS>
She
wore
a
short
cloak
which
fitted
close
to
her
person
,
and
,
though
she
occupied
a
great
arm
-
chair
,
sat
perfectly
upright
,
looking
at
the
fire
.
<EOS>
Very
small
she
was
,
but
she
carried
in
her
grey
eyes
and
sharp
-
cut
features
a
certain
look
of
importance
which
saved
her
from
being
considered
as
small
in
importance
.
<EOS>
Alice
,
as
soon
as
she
saw
her
,
knew
that
she
was
a
lady
over
whom
no
easy
victory
could
be
obtained
.
  
<EOS>
"
Here
is
Alice
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
,
rising
as
her
cousin
entered
the
room
.
<EOS>
"
Alice
,
let
me
introduce
you
to
Lady
Midlothian
.
"
  
<EOS>
Alice
,
as
she
came
forward
,
was
able
to
assume
an
easy
demeanour
,
even
though
her
heart
within
was
failing
her
.
<EOS>
She
put
out
her
hand
,
leaving
it
to
the
elder
lady
to
speak
the
first
words
of
greeting
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
at
last
to
be
able
to
make
your
acquaintance
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Lady
Midlothian
;
"
very
glad
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
still
Alice
did
not
speak
.
"
<EOS>
Your
aunt
,
Lady
Macleod
,
is
one
of
my
oldest
friends
,
and
I
have
heard
her
speak
of
you
very
often
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
Lady
Macleod
has
often
spoken
to
me
of
your
ladyship
,
"
said
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
we
know
each
other
's
names
,
"
said
the
Countess
;
"
and
it
will
be
well
that
we
should
be
acquainted
with
each
other
's
persons
.
<EOS>
I
am
becoming
an
old
woman
,
and
if
I
did
not
learn
to
know
you
now
,
or
very
shortly
,
I
might
never
do
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Alice
could
not
help
thinking
that
even
under
those
circumstances
neither
might
have
had
,
so
far
as
that
was
concerned
,
much
cause
of
sorrow
,
but
she
did
not
say
so
.
<EOS>
She
was
thinking
altogether
of
Lady
Midlothian
's
letter
to
her
,
and
trying
to
calculate
whether
or
no
it
would
be
well
for
her
to
rush
away
at
once
to
the
subject
.
<EOS>
That
Lady
Midlothian
would
mention
the
letter
,
Alice
felt
well
assured
;
and
when
could
it
be
better
mentioned
than
now
,
in
Glencora
's
presence
,
 
when
no
other
person
was
near
them
to
listen
to
her
?
<EOS>
"
You
are
very
kind
,
"
said
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
wish
to
be
so
,
"
said
Lady
Midlothian
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Blood
is
thicker
than
water
,
my
dear
;
and
I
know
no
earthly
ties
that
can
bind
people
together
if
those
of
family
connection
will
not
do
so
.
<EOS>
Your
mother
,
when
she
and
I
were
young
,
was
my
dearest
friend
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
knew
my
mother
,
"
said
Alice
,
 
feeling
,
however
,
as
she
spoke
,
that
the
strength
of
her
resistance
to
the
old
woman
was
beginning
to
give
way
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
my
dear
,
you
never
did
;
and
that
is
to
my
thinking
another
reason
why
they
who
loved
her
should
love
you
.
<EOS>
But
Lady
Macleod
is
your
nearest
relative
,
 
on
your
mother
's
side
,
I
mean
,
 
and
she
has
done
her
duty
by
you
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
she
has
,
Lady
Midlothian
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
has
,
and
others
,
therefore
,
have
been
the
less
called
upon
to
interfere
.
<EOS>
I
only
say
this
,
my
dear
,
in
my
own
vindication
,
 
feeling
,
perhaps
,
that
my
conduct
needs
some
excuse
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
sure
Alice
does
not
think
that
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
what
I
think
rather
than
what
Alice
thinks
that
concerns
my
own
shortcomings
,
"
said
Lady
Midlothian
,
with
a
smile
which
was
intended
to
be
pleasant
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
have
wished
to
make
up
for
former
lost
opportunities
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Alice
knew
that
she
was
about
to
refer
to
her
letter
,
and
trembled
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
anxious
now
to
be
reckoned
one
of
Alice
Vavasor
's
friends
,
if
she
will
allow
me
to
become
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
only
be
too
proud
,
 
if
 
"
  
"
If
what
,
my
dear
?
"
said
the
old
lady
.
<EOS>
I
believe
that
she
meant
to
be
gracious
,
but
there
was
something
in
her
manner
,
or
,
perhaps
,
rather
in
her
voice
,
so
repellant
,
that
Alice
felt
that
they
could
hardly
become
true
friends
.
<EOS>
"
If
what
,
my
dear
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Alice
means
 
"
began
Lady
Glencora
.
  
<EOS>
"
Let
Alice
say
what
she
means
herself
,
"
said
Lady
Midlothian
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hardly
know
how
to
say
what
I
do
mean
,
"
said
Alice
,
whose
spirit
within
her
was
rising
higher
as
the
occasion
for
using
it
came
upon
her
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
assured
that
you
and
I
,
Lady
Midlothian
,
differ
very
much
as
to
a
certain
matter
;
and
as
it
is
one
in
which
I
must
be
guided
by
my
own
opinion
,
and
not
that
of
any
other
person
,
<EOS>
perhaps
 
"
  
"
You
mean
about
Mr.
Grey
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Alice
;
"
I
mean
about
Mr.
Grey
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
so
much
about
that
matter
,
and
your
happiness
as
therein
concerned
,
that
when
I
heard
that
you
were
here
I
was
determined
to
take
Matching
in
my
way
to
London
,
so
that
I
might
have
an
opportunity
of
speaking
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
you
knew
that
Alice
was
here
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
.
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
I
did
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
you
have
heard
all
the
history
,
Glencora
?
"
  
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
was
forced
to
acknowledge
that
she
had
heard
the
history
,
 
"
the
history
"
being
poor
Alice
's
treatment
of
Mr.
Grey
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
do
you
think
of
it
?
"
<EOS>
Both
Alice
and
her
hostess
looked
round
to
the
further
end
of
the
room
in
which
Miss
Palliser
was
reading
,
intending
thus
to
indicate
that
the
lady
knew
as
yet
none
of
the
circumstances
,
and
that
there
could
be
no
good
reason
why
she
should
be
instructed
in
them
at
this
moment
.
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
another
time
and
another
place
may
be
better
,
"
said
Lady
Midlothian
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
must
go
the
day
after
to
-
morrow
,
 
indeed
<EOS>
,
I
thought
of
going
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Lady
Midlothian
!
"
exclaimed
Lady
Glencora
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
regard
this
as
merely
a
passing
visit
,
made
upon
business
.
<EOS>
But
,
as
I
was
saying
,
when
shall
I
get
an
opportunity
of
speaking
to
Alice
where
we
need
not
be
interrupted
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
suggested
her
room
up
-
stairs
,
and
offered
the
use
of
it
then
,
or
on
that
night
when
the
world
should
be
about
to
go
to
bed
.
<EOS>
But
the
idea
of
this
premeditated
lecture
was
terrible
to
Alice
,
and
she
determined
that
she
would
not
endure
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Lady
Midlothian
,
it
would
really
be
of
no
use
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Of
no
use
,
my
dear
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
I
did
get
your
letter
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
as
you
have
not
answered
it
,
I
have
come
all
this
way
to
see
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
so
sorry
if
I
give
offence
,
but
it
is
a
subject
which
I
can
not
bring
myself
to
discuss
"
 
<EOS>
she
was
going
to
say
with
a
stranger
,
but
she
was
able
to
check
herself
before
the
offensive
word
was
uttered
,
 
"
which
I
can
not
bring
myself
to
discuss
with
any
one
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
do
n't
mean
to
say
that
you
wo
n't
see
me
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
talk
upon
that
matter
,
"
said
Alice
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
do
it
even
with
Lady
Macleod
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Lady
Midlothian
,
and
<EOS>
her
sharp
grey
eyes
now
began
to
kindle
with
anger
;
"
and
therefore
it
is
so
very
necessary
that
other
friends
should
interfere
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
will
endure
no
interference
,
"
said
Alice
,
"
either
from
persons
who
are
friends
or
who
are
not
friends
.
"
<EOS>
And
as
she
spoke
she
rose
from
her
chair
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
forgive
me
,
Lady
Midlothian
,
if
I
say
that
I
can
have
no
conversation
with
you
on
this
matter
.
<EOS>
"
Then
she
walked
out
of
the
room
,
leaving
the
Countess
and
Lady
Glencora
together
.
<EOS>
As
she
went
Miss
Palliser
lifted
her
eyes
from
her
book
,
and
knew
that
there
had
been
a
quarrel
,
but
I
doubt
if
she
had
heard
any
of
the
words
which
had
been
spoken
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
most
self
-
willed
young
woman
I
ever
met
in
my
life
,
"
said
Lady
Midlothian
,
as
soon
as
Alice
was
gone
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
knew
very
well
how
it
would
be
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
it
is
quite
frightful
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
She
has
been
engaged
,
with
the
consent
of
all
her
friends
,
to
this
young
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
all
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
must
think
she
is
very
wrong
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
quite
understand
her
,
but
I
suppose
she
fears
they
would
not
be
happy
together
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Understand
her
!
<EOS>
I
should
think
not
;
nobody
can
understand
her
.
<EOS>
A
young
woman
to
become
engaged
to
a
gentleman
in
that
way
,
 
before
all
the
world
,
as
one
may
say
;
 
to
go
to
his
house
,
as
I
am
told
,
and
talk
to
the
servants
,
and
give
orders
about
the
furniture
and
then
turn
round
and
simply
say
that
she
has
changed
her
mind
!
<EOS>
She
has
n't
given
the
slightest
reason
to
my
knowledge
.
"
<EOS>
And
Lady
Midlothian
,
as
she
insisted
on
the
absolute
iniquity
of
Alice
's
proceedings
,
almost
startled
Lady
Glencora
by
the
eagerness
of
her
countenance
.
<EOS>
Lady
Midlothian
had
been
one
of
those
who
,
even
now
not
quite
two
years
ago
,
had
assisted
in
obtaining
the
submission
of
Lady
Glencora
herself
.
<EOS>
Lady
Midlothian
seemed
on
the
present
occasion
to
remember
nothing
of
this
,
but
Lady
Glencora
remembered
it
very
exactly
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
not
give
it
up
,
"
continued
Lady
Midlothian
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
the
greatest
possible
objection
to
her
father
,
who
contrived
to
connect
himself
with
our
family
in
a
most
shameful
manner
,
without
the
slightest
encouragement
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
think
I
have
spoken
to
him
since
,
but
I
shall
see
him
now
and
tell
him
my
opinion
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Alice
held
her
ground
,
and
avoided
all
further
conversation
with
Lady
Midlothian
.
<EOS>
A
message
came
to
her
through
Lady
Glencora
imploring
her
to
give
way
,
but
she
was
quite
firm
.
  
<EOS>
"
Good
-
bye
to
you
,
"
Lady
Midlothian
said
to
her
as
she
went
.
"
<EOS>
Even
yet
I
hope
that
things
may
go
right
,
and
if
so
you
will
find
that
I
can
forget
and
forgive
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
perseverance
merits
success
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
to
Alice
,
"
she
ought
to
succeed
.
"
<EOS>
"
But
she
wo
n't
succeed
,
"
said
Alice
.
   
<EOS>
The
Priory
Ruins
.
 
<EOS>
Lady
Midlothian
went
away
on
her
road
to
London
on
the
Wednesday
morning
,
and
Alice
was
to
follow
her
on
the
next
day
.
<EOS>
It
was
now
December
,
and
the
weather
was
very
clear
and
frosty
,
but
at
night
there
was
bright
moonlight
.
<EOS>
On
this
special
night
the
moon
would
be
full
,
and
Lady
Glencora
had
declared
that
she
and
Alice
would
go
out
amidst
the
ruins
.
<EOS>
It
was
no
secret
engagement
,
having
been
canvassed
in
public
,
and
having
been
met
with
considerable
discouragement
by
some
of
the
party
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
had
remarked
that
the
night
air
would
be
very
cold
,
and
Mr.
Bott
had
suggested
all
manner
of
evil
consequences
.
<EOS>
Had
Mr.
Palliser
alone
objected
,
Lady
Glencora
might
have
given
way
,
but
Mr.
Bott
's
word
riveted
her
purpose
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
are
not
going
to
be
frightened
,
"
Lady
Glencora
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
People
do
not
generally
walk
out
at
night
in
December
,
"
Mr.
Palliser
observed
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
just
the
reason
why
we
want
to
do
it
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
"
But
we
shall
wrap
ourselves
up
,
and
nobody
need
be
afraid
.
<EOS>
Jeffrey
,
we
shall
expect
you
to
stand
sentinel
at
the
old
gate
,
and
guard
us
from
the
ghosts
.
"
  
<EOS>
Jeffrey
Palliser
,
bargaining
that
he
might
be
allowed
a
cigar
,
promised
that
he
would
do
as
he
was
bidden
.
  
<EOS>
The
party
at
Matching
Priory
had
by
this
time
become
very
small
.
<EOS>
There
were
indeed
no
guests
left
,
not
counting
those
of
the
Palliser
family
,
excepting
Miss
Vavasor
,
Mr.
Bott
,
and
an
old
lady
who
had
been
a
great
friend
of
Mr.
Palliser
's
mother
.
<EOS>
It
was
past
ten
in
the
evening
when
Lady
Glencora
declared
that
the
time
had
arrived
for
them
to
carry
out
their
purpose
.
<EOS>
She
invited
the
two
Miss
Pallisers
to
join
her
,
but
they
declined
,
urging
their
fear
of
the
night
air
,
and
showing
by
their
manner
that
they
thought
the
proposition
a
very
imprudent
one
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bott
offered
to
accompany
them
,
but
Lady
Glencora
declined
his
attendance
very
stoutly
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
indeed
,
Mr.
Bott
;
you
were
one
of
those
who
preached
a
sermon
against
my
dissipation
in
the
morning
,
and
I
'm
not
going
to
allow
you
to
join
it
,
now
the
time
for
its
enjoyment
has
come
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Lady
Glencora
,
if
I
were
you
,
indeed
I
would
n't
,
"
said
the
old
lady
,
looking
round
towards
Mr.
Palliser
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Mrs.
Marsham
,
if
you
were
me
,
indeed
you
would
,
"
and
Lady
Glencora
also
looked
at
her
husband
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
a
foolish
thing
to
do
,
"
said
Mr.
Palliser
,
sternly
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
forbid
it
,
of
course
we
wo
n't
go
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
.
  
<EOS>
"
Forbid
it
:
 
<EOS>
no
;
I
shall
not
forbid
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Allons
donc
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
.
  
<EOS>
She
and
Alice
were
already
muffled
in
cloaks
and
thick
shawls
,
and
Alice
now
followed
her
out
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
door
which
opened
from
the
billiard
-
room
out
on
to
the
grand
terrace
,
which
ran
in
front
of
the
house
,
and
here
they
found
Jeffrey
Palliser
already
armed
with
his
cigar
.
<EOS>
Alice
,
to
tell
the
truth
,
would
much
have
preferred
to
abandon
the
expedition
,
but
she
had
felt
that
it
would
be
cowardly
in
her
to
desert
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
There
had
not
arisen
any
very
close
intimacy
between
her
and
Mr.
Palliser
,
but
she
entertained
a
certain
feeling
that
Mr.
Palliser
trusted
her
,
and
liked
her
to
be
with
his
wife
.
<EOS>
She
would
have
wished
to
justify
this
supposed
confidence
,
and
was
almost
sure
that
Mr.
Palliser
expected
her
to
do
so
in
this
instance
.
<EOS>
She
did
say
a
word
or
two
to
her
cousin
up
-
stairs
,
urging
that
perhaps
her
husband
would
not
like
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Let
him
say
so
plainly
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
,
"
and
I
'll
give
it
up
instantly
.
<EOS>
But
I
'm
not
going
to
be
lectured
out
of
my
purposes
<EOS>
secondhand
by
Mr.
Bott
or
old
Mother
Marsham
.
<EOS>
I
understand
all
these
people
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
And
if
you
throw
me
over
,
Alice
,
I
'll
never
forgive
you
,
"
Lady
Glencora
added
.
  
<EOS>
After
this
Alice
resolved
that
she
would
not
throw
her
friend
over
.
<EOS>
She
was
afraid
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
But
she
was
also
becoming
a
little
afraid
of
her
friend
,
 
<EOS>
afraid
that
she
would
be
driven
some
day
either
to
throw
her
over
,
or
to
say
words
to
her
that
would
be
very
unpalatable
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
Jeffrey
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
as
they
walked
abreast
along
the
broad
terrace
towards
the
ruins
,
"
when
we
get
under
the
old
gateway
you
must
let
me
and
Alice
go
round
the
dormitory
and
the
chapel
alone
.
<EOS>
Then
we
'll
come
back
by
the
cloisters
,
and
we
'll
take
another
turn
outside
with
you
.
<EOS>
The
outside
is
the
finest
by
this
light
,
 
only
I
want
to
show
Alice
something
by
ourselves
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
're
not
afraid
,
I
know
,
and
if
Miss
Vavasor
is
not
 
"
  
"
Miss
Vavasor
,
 
who
,
I
think
,
would
have
allowed
you
to
call
her
by
her
other
name
on
such
an
occasion
as
this
,
 
is
never
afraid
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Glencora
,
how
dare
you
say
so
?
"
said
Alice
.
<EOS>
"
I
really
think
we
had
better
go
back
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
felt
herself
to
be
very
angry
with
her
cousin
.
<EOS>
She
almost
began
to
fear
that
she
had
mistaken
her
,
and
had
thought
better
of
her
than
she
had
deserved
.
<EOS>
What
she
had
now
said
struck
Alice
as
being
vulgar
,
 
as
being
premeditated
vulgarity
,
and
her
annoyance
was
excessive
.
<EOS>
Of
course
Mr.
Palliser
would
think
that
she
was
a
consenting
party
to
the
proposition
made
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Go
back
!
"
said
Glencora
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
We
'll
go
on
,
and
leave
him
here
.
<EOS>
Then
he
can
call
nobody
anything
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
be
angry
with
me
,
"
she
said
,
as
soon
as
they
were
out
of
hearing
.
<EOS>
"
The
truth
is
this
;
 
if
you
choose
to
have
him
for
your
husband
,
you
may
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
if
I
do
not
choose
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
there
can
be
no
harm
done
,
and
I
will
tell
him
so
.
<EOS>
But
,
Alice
,
 
think
of
this
.
<EOS>
Whom
will
you
meet
that
would
suit
you
better
?
<EOS>
And
you
need
not
decide
now
.
<EOS>
You
need
not
say
a
word
,
but
leave
me
to
tell
him
,
that
if
it
is
to
be
thought
of
at
all
,
it
can
not
be
thought
of
till
he
meets
you
in
London
.
<EOS>
Trust
me
,
you
will
be
safe
with
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
shall
tell
him
nothing
of
the
kind
,
"
said
Alice
.
<EOS>
"
I
believe
you
to
be
joking
throughout
,
and
I
think
the
joke
is
a
bad
one
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
there
you
wrong
me
.
<EOS>
Indeed
I
am
not
joking
.
<EOS>
I
know
that
in
what
I
am
saying
I
am
telling
you
the
simple
truth
.
<EOS>
He
has
said
enough
to
me
to
justify
me
in
saying
so
.
<EOS>
Alice
,
think
of
it
all
.
<EOS>
It
would
reconcile
me
to
much
,
and
it
would
be
something
to
be
the
mother
of
the
future
Duke
of
Omnium
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
To
me
it
would
be
nothing
,
"
said
Alice
;
"
less
than
nothing
.
<EOS>
I
mean
to
say
that
the
temptation
is
one
so
easily
resisted
that
it
acts
in
the
other
way
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
say
anything
more
about
it
,
Glencora
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
do
n't
wish
it
,
I
will
not
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
 
I
do
not
wish
it
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
think
I
ever
saw
moonlight
so
bright
as
this
.
<EOS>
Look
at
the
lines
of
that
window
against
the
light
.
<EOS>
They
are
clearer
than
you
ever
see
them
in
the
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
They
were
now
standing
just
within
the
gateway
of
the
old
cruciform
chapel
,
having
entered
the
transept
from
a
ruined
passage
which
was
supposed
to
have
connected
the
church
with
the
dormitory
.
<EOS>
The
church
was
altogether
roofless
,
but
the
entire
walls
were
standing
.
<EOS>
The
small
clerestory
windows
of
the
nave
were
perfect
,
and
the
large
windows
of
the
two
transepts
and
of
the
west
end
were
nearly
so
.
<EOS>
Of
the
opposite
window
,
which
had
formed
the
back
of
the
choir
,
very
little
remained
.
<EOS>
The
top
of
it
,
with
all
its
tracery
,
was
gone
,
and
three
broken
upright
mullions
of
uneven
heights
alone
remained
.
<EOS>
This
was
all
that
remained
of
the
old
window
,
but
a
transom
or
cross
-
bar
of
stone
had
been
added
to
protect
the
carved
stone
-
work
of
the
sides
,
and
save
the
form
of
the
aperture
from
further
ruin
.
<EOS>
That
this
transom
was
modern
was
to
be
seen
from
the
magnificent
height
and
light
grace
of
the
workmanship
in
the
other
windows
,
in
which
the
long
slender
mullions
rose
from
the
lower
stage
or
foundation
of
the
whole
up
into
the
middle
tracery
of
the
arch
without
protection
or
support
,
and
then
lost
themselves
among
the
curves
,
not
running
up
into
the
roof
or
soffit
,
and
there
holding
on
as
though
unable
to
stand
alone
.
<EOS>
Such
weakness
as
that
had
not
as
yet
shown
itself
in
English
church
architecture
when
Matching
Priory
was
built
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
it
not
beautiful
!
"
said
Glencora
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
love
it
so
!
<EOS>
And
there
is
a
peculiar
feeling
of
cold
about
the
chill
of
the
moon
,
different
from
any
other
cold
.
<EOS>
It
makes
you
wrap
yourself
up
tight
,
but
it
does
not
make
your
teeth
chatter
;
and
it
seems
to
go
into
your
senses
rather
than
into
your
bones
.
<EOS>
But
I
suppose
that
's
nonsense
,
"
she
added
,
after
a
pause
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
more
so
than
what
people
are
supposed
to
talk
by
moonlight
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
unkind
.
<EOS>
I
'd
like
what
I
say
on
such
an
occasion
to
be
more
poetical
or
else
more
nonsensical
than
what
other
people
say
under
the
same
circumstances
.
<EOS>
And
now
I
'll
tell
you
why
I
always
think
of
you
when
I
come
here
by
moonlight
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
suppose
you
do
n't
often
come
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
do
;
that
is
to
say
,
I
did
come
very
often
when
we
had
the
full
moon
in
August
.
<EOS>
The
weather
was
n't
like
this
,
and
I
used
to
run
out
through
the
open
windows
and
nobody
knew
where
I
was
gone
.
<EOS>
I
made
him
come
once
,
but
he
did
n't
seem
to
care
about
it
.
<EOS>
I
told
him
that
part
of
the
refectory
wall
was
falling
;
so
he
looked
at
that
,
and
had
a
mason
sent
the
next
day
.
<EOS>
If
anything
is
out
of
order
he
has
it
put
to
rights
at
once
.
<EOS>
There
would
have
been
no
ruins
if
all
the
Pallisers
had
been
like
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
So
much
the
better
for
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
 
I
say
no
.
<EOS>
Things
may
live
too
long
.
<EOS>
But
now
I
'm
going
to
tell
you
.
<EOS>
Do
you
remember
that
night
I
brought
you
home
from
the
play
to
Queen
Anne
Street
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
I
do
,
 
very
well
.
"
  
<EOS>
Alice
had
occasion
to
remember
it
,
for
it
had
been
in
the
carriage
on
that
evening
that
she
had
positively
refused
to
give
any
aid
to
her
cousin
in
that
matter
relating
to
Burgo
Fitzgerald
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
do
you
remember
how
the
moon
shone
then
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
think
I
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
I
do
.
<EOS>
As
we
came
round
the
corner
out
of
Cavendish
Square
<EOS>
he
was
standing
there
,
 
and
a
friend
of
yours
was
standing
with
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
friend
of
mine
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Never
mind
that
;
it
does
not
matter
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
mean
my
cousin
George
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
do
mean
your
cousin
;
and
oh
,
Alice
!
<EOS>
dear
Alice
!
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
why
I
should
love
you
,
for
if
you
had
not
been
hardhearted
that
night
,
 
<EOS>
stony
cruel
in
your
hard
propriety
,
I
should
have
gone
with
him
then
,
and
all
this
icy
coldness
would
have
been
prevented
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
was
standing
quite
close
to
Alice
,
and
as
she
spake
she
shook
with
shivering
and
wrapped
her
furs
closer
and
still
closer
about
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
very
cold
,
"
said
Alice
.
<EOS>
"
We
had
better
go
in
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
am
not
cold
,
 
not
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
go
in
yet
.
<EOS>
Jeffrey
will
come
to
us
directly
.
<EOS>
Yes
;
 
we
should
have
escaped
that
night
if
you
would
have
allowed
him
to
come
into
your
house
.
<EOS>
Ah
,
well
!
<EOS>
we
did
n't
,
and
there
's
an
end
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
Glencora
,
 
you
can
not
regret
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
regret
it
!
<EOS>
Alice
,
where
can
your
heart
be
?
<EOS>
Or
have
you
a
heart
?
<EOS>
Not
regret
it
!
<EOS>
I
would
give
everything
I
have
in
the
world
to
have
been
true
to
him
.
<EOS>
They
told
me
that
he
would
spend
my
money
.
<EOS>
Though
he
should
have
spent
every
farthing
of
it
,
I
regret
it
;
though
he
should
have
made
me
a
beggar
,
I
regret
it
.
<EOS>
They
told
me
that
he
would
ill
-
use
me
,
and
desert
me
,
 
perhaps
beat
me
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
believe
it
;
but
even
though
that
should
have
been
so
,
I
regret
it
.
<EOS>
It
is
better
to
have
a
false
husband
than
to
be
a
false
wife
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Glencora
,
do
not
speak
like
that
.
<EOS>
Do
not
try
to
make
me
think
that
anything
could
tempt
you
to
be
false
to
your
vows
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Tempt
me
to
be
false
!
<EOS>
Why
,
child
,
it
has
been
all
false
throughout
.
<EOS>
I
never
loved
him
.
<EOS>
How
can
you
talk
in
that
way
,
when
you
know
that
I
never
loved
him
?
<EOS>
They
browbeat
me
and
frightened
me
till
I
did
as
I
was
told
;
 
and
now
;
 
what
am
I
now
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
his
honest
wife
.
<EOS>
Glencora
,
listen
to
me
.
"
<EOS>
And
Alice
took
hold
of
her
arm
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
she
said
,
"
no
;
I
am
not
honest
.
<EOS>
By
law
I
am
his
wife
;
but
the
laws
are
liars
!
<EOS>
I
am
not
his
wife
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
say
the
thing
that
I
am
.
<EOS>
When
I
went
to
him
at
the
altar
,
I
knew
that
I
did
not
love
the
man
that
was
to
be
my
husband
.
<EOS>
But
him
,
 
Burgo
,
 
I
love
him
with
all
my
heart
and
soul
.
<EOS>
I
could
stoop
at
his
feet
and
clean
his
shoes
for
him
,
and
think
it
no
disgrace
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Cora
,
my
friend
,
do
not
say
such
words
as
those
!
<EOS>
Remember
what
you
owe
your
husband
and
yourself
,
and
come
away
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
know
what
I
owe
him
,
and
I
will
pay
it
him
.
<EOS>
Alice
,
if
I
had
a
child
I
think
I
would
be
true
to
him
.
<EOS>
Think
!
<EOS>
I
know
I
would
;
 
though
I
had
no
hour
of
happiness
left
to
me
in
my
life
.
<EOS>
But
what
now
is
the
only
honest
thing
that
I
can
do
?
<EOS>
Why
,
leave
him
;
 
so
leave
him
that
he
may
have
another
wife
and
be
the
father
of
a
child
.
<EOS>
What
injury
shall
I
do
him
by
leaving
him
?
<EOS>
He
does
not
love
me
;
you
know
yourself
that
he
does
not
love
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
that
he
does
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Alice
,
that
is
untrue
.
<EOS>
He
does
not
;
and
you
have
seen
clearly
that
it
is
so
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
that
he
can
love
no
woman
.
<EOS>
But
another
woman
would
give
him
a
son
,
and
he
would
be
happy
.
<EOS>
I
tell
you
that
every
day
and
every
night
,
 
every
hour
of
every
day
and
of
every
night
,
 
I
am
thinking
of
the
man
I
love
.
<EOS>
I
have
nothing
else
to
think
of
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
occupation
,
 
no
friends
,
 
no
one
to
whom
I
care
to
say
a
word
.
<EOS>
But
I
am
always
talking
to
Burgo
in
my
thoughts
;
and
he
listens
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
dream
that
his
arm
is
round
me
 
"
  
"
Oh
,
Glencora
!
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Well
!
 
<EOS>
Do
you
begrudge
me
that
I
should
tell
you
the
truth
?
<EOS>
You
have
said
that
you
would
be
my
friend
,
and
you
must
bear
the
burden
of
my
friendship
.
<EOS>
And
now
,
 
this
is
what
I
want
to
tell
you
.
 
<EOS>
Immediately
after
Christmas
,
we
are
to
go
to
Monkshade
,
and
he
will
be
there
.
<EOS>
Lady
Monk
is
his
aunt
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
not
go
.
<EOS>
No
power
should
take
you
there
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
easily
said
,
child
;
but
all
the
same
I
must
go
.
<EOS>
I
told
Mr.
Palliser
that
he
would
be
there
,
and
he
said
it
did
not
signify
.
<EOS>
He
actually
said
that
it
did
not
signify
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
whether
he
understands
what
it
is
for
people
to
love
each
other
;
 
whether
he
has
ever
thought
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
tell
him
plainly
that
you
will
not
go
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
.
<EOS>
I
told
him
plainly
as
words
could
tell
him
.
"
<EOS>
Glencora
,
"
he
said
,
 
and
you
know
the
way
he
looks
when
he
means
to
be
lord
and
master
,
and
put
on
the
very
husband
indeed
,
 
<EOS>
"
This
is
an
annoyance
which
you
must
bear
and
overcome
.
<EOS>
It
suits
me
that
we
should
go
to
Monkshade
,
and
it
does
not
suit
me
that
there
should
be
any
one
whom
you
are
afraid
to
meet
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Could
I
tell
him
that
he
would
lose
his
wife
if
I
did
go
?
<EOS>
Could
I
threaten
him
that
I
would
throw
myself
into
Burgo
's
arms
if
that
opportunity
were
given
to
me
?
<EOS>
You
are
very
wise
,
and
very
prudent
.
<EOS>
What
would
you
have
had
me
say
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
would
have
you
now
tell
him
everything
,
rather
than
go
to
that
house
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Alice
,
look
here
.
<EOS>
I
know
what
I
am
,
and
what
I
am
like
to
become
.
<EOS>
I
loathe
myself
,
and
I
loathe
the
thing
that
I
am
thinking
of
.
<EOS>
I
could
have
clung
to
the
outside
of
a
man
's
body
,
to
his
very
trappings
,
and
loved
him
ten
times
better
than
myself
!
 
<EOS>
ay
,
even
though
he
had
ill
-
treated
me
,
 
if
I
had
been
allowed
to
choose
a
husband
for
myself
.
<EOS>
Burgo
would
have
spent
my
money
,
 
all
that
it
would
have
been
possible
for
me
to
give
him
.
<EOS>
But
there
would
have
been
something
left
,
and
I
think
that
by
that
time
I
could
have
won
even
him
to
care
for
me
.
<EOS>
But
with
that
man
 
!
<EOS>
Alice
you
are
very
wise
.
<EOS>
What
am
I
to
do
?
"
  
<EOS>
Alice
had
no
doubt
as
to
what
her
cousin
should
do
.
<EOS>
She
should
be
true
to
her
marriage
-
vow
,
whether
that
vow
when
made
were
true
or
false
.
<EOS>
She
should
be
true
to
it
as
far
as
truth
would
now
carry
her
.
<EOS>
And
in
order
that
she
might
be
true
,
she
should
tell
her
husband
as
much
as
might
be
necessary
to
induce
him
to
spare
her
the
threatened
visit
to
Monkshade
.
<EOS>
All
that
she
said
to
Lady
Glencora
,
as
they
walked
slowly
across
the
chapel
.
<EOS>
But
Lady
Glencora
was
more
occupied
with
her
own
thoughts
than
with
her
friend
's
advice
.
<EOS>
"
Here
's
Jeffrey
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
What
an
unconscionable
time
we
have
kept
him
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
mention
it
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
And
I
should
n't
have
come
to
you
now
,
only
that
I
thought
I
should
find
you
both
freezing
into
marble
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
are
not
such
cold
-
blooded
creatures
as
that
,
 
are
we
,
Alice
?
"
said
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
"
And
now
we
'll
go
round
the
outside
;
only
we
must
not
stay
long
,
or
we
shall
frighten
those
two
delicious
old
duennas
,
Mrs.
Marsham
and
Mr.
Bott
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
These
last
words
were
said
as
it
were
in
a
whisper
to
Alice
;
but
they
were
so
whispered
that
there
was
no
real
attempt
to
keep
them
from
the
ears
of
Mr.
Jeffrey
Palliser
.
<EOS>
Glencora
,
Alice
thought
,
should
not
have
allowed
the
word
duenna
to
have
passed
her
lips
in
speaking
to
any
one
;
but
,
above
all
,
she
should
not
have
done
so
in
the
hearing
of
Mr.
Palliser
's
cousin
.
  
<EOS>
They
walked
<EOS>
all
round
the
ruin
,
on
a
raised
gravel
-
path
which
had
been
made
there
;
and
Alice
,
who
could
hardly
bring
herself
to
speak
,
 
so
full
was
her
mind
of
that
which
had
just
been
said
to
her
,
 
was
surprised
to
find
that
Glencora
could
go
on
,
in
her
usual
light
humour
,
chatting
as
though
there
were
no
weight
within
her
to
depress
her
spirits
.
   
<EOS>
Alice
Leaves
the
Priory
.
 
<EOS>
As
they
came
in
at
the
billiard
-
room
door
,
Mr.
Palliser
was
there
to
meet
them
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
be
very
cold
,
"
he
said
to
Glencora
,
who
entered
first
.
"
<EOS>
No
,
indeed
,
"
said
Glencora
;
 
but
her
teeth
were
chattering
,
and
her
whole
appearance
gave
the
lie
to
her
words
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Jeffrey
,
"
said
Mr.
Palliser
,
turning
to
his
cousin
,
"
I
am
angry
with
you
.
<EOS>
You
,
at
least
,
should
have
known
better
than
to
have
allowed
her
to
remain
so
long
.
"
<EOS>
Then
Mr.
Palliser
turned
away
,
and
walked
his
wife
off
,
taking
no
notice
whatsoever
of
Miss
Vavasor
.
  
<EOS>
Alice
felt
the
slight
,
and
understood
it
all
.
<EOS>
He
had
told
her
plainly
enough
,
though
not
in
words
,
that
he
had
trusted
his
wife
with
her
,
and
that
she
had
betrayed
the
trust
.
<EOS>
She
might
have
brought
Glencora
in
within
five
or
six
minutes
,
instead
of
allowing
her
to
remain
out
there
in
the
freezing
night
air
for
nearly
three
-
quarters
of
an
hour
.
<EOS>
That
was
the
accusation
which
Mr.
Palliser
made
against
her
,
and
he
made
it
with
the
utmost
severity
.
<EOS>
He
asked
no
question
of
her
whether
she
were
cold
.
<EOS>
He
spoke
no
word
to
her
,
nor
did
he
even
look
at
her
.
<EOS>
She
might
get
herself
away
to
her
bedroom
as
she
pleased
.
<EOS>
Alice
understood
all
this
completely
,
and
though
she
knew
that
she
had
not
deserved
such
severity
,
she
was
not
inclined
to
resent
it
.
<EOS>
There
was
so
much
in
Mr.
Palliser
's
position
that
was
to
be
pitied
,
that
Alice
could
not
find
it
in
her
heart
to
be
angry
with
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
provoked
with
us
,
now
,
"
said
Jeffrey
Palliser
,
standing
with
her
for
a
moment
in
the
billiard
-
room
,
as
he
handed
her
a
candle
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
afraid
that
she
will
have
caught
cold
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
;
and
he
thinks
it
wrong
that
she
should
remain
out
at
night
so
long
.
<EOS>
You
can
easily
understand
,
Miss
Vavasor
,
that
he
has
not
much
sympathy
for
romance
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
dare
say
he
is
right
,
"
said
Alice
,
not
exactly
knowing
what
to
say
,
and
not
being
able
to
forget
what
had
been
said
about
herself
and
Jeffrey
Palliser
when
they
first
left
the
house
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Romance
usually
means
nonsense
,
I
believe
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
not
Glencora
's
doctrine
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
but
she
is
younger
than
I
am
.
<EOS>
My
feet
are
very
cold
,
Mr.
Palliser
,
and
I
think
I
will
go
up
to
my
room
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Good
night
,
"
said
Jeffrey
,
offering
her
his
hand
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
so
hard
that
you
should
have
incurred
his
displeasure
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
will
not
hurt
me
,
"
said
Alice
,
smiling
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
 
but
he
does
not
forget
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Even
that
will
not
hurt
me
.
<EOS>
Good
night
,
Mr.
Palliser
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
As
it
is
the
last
night
,
may
I
say
good
night
,
Alice
?
<EOS>
I
shall
be
away
to
-
morrow
before
you
are
up
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
still
held
her
hand
;
but
it
had
not
been
in
his
for
half
a
minute
,
and
she
had
thought
nothing
of
that
,
nor
did
she
draw
it
away
even
now
suddenly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
"
said
she
,
"
Glencora
was
very
wrong
there
,
 
doing
an
injury
without
meaning
it
to
both
of
us
.
<EOS>
There
can
be
no
possible
reason
why
you
should
call
me
otherwise
than
is
customary
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Can
there
never
be
a
reason
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
Mr.
Palliser
.
<EOS>
Good
night
;
 
and
if
I
am
not
to
see
you
to
-
morrow
morning
,
good
-
bye
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
certainly
not
see
me
to
-
morrow
morning
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Good
-
bye
.
<EOS>
Had
it
not
been
for
this
folly
of
Glencora
's
,
our
acquaintance
would
have
been
very
pleasant
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
To
me
it
has
been
very
pleasant
.
<EOS>
Good
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Then
she
left
him
,
and
went
up
alone
to
her
own
room
.
<EOS>
Whether
or
no
other
guests
were
still
left
in
the
drawing
-
room
she
did
not
know
;
but
she
had
seen
that
Mr.
Palliser
took
his
wife
up
-
stairs
,
and
therefore
she
considered
herself
right
in
presuming
that
the
party
was
broken
up
for
the
night
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
,
 
Plantagenet
Palliser
,
according
to
all
rules
of
courtesy
should
have
said
a
word
to
her
as
he
went
;
but
,
as
I
have
said
before
,
Alice
was
disposed
to
overlook
his
want
of
civility
on
this
occasion
.
<EOS>
So
she
went
up
alone
to
her
room
,
and
was
very
glad
to
find
herself
able
to
get
close
to
a
good
fire
.
<EOS>
She
was
,
in
truth
,
very
cold
 
cold
to
her
bones
,
in
spite
of
what
Lady
Glencora
had
said
on
behalf
of
the
moonlight
.
<EOS>
They
two
had
been
standing
all
but
still
during
the
greater
part
of
the
time
that
they
had
been
talking
,
and
Alice
,
as
she
sat
herself
down
,
found
that
her
feet
were
numbed
with
the
damp
that
had
penetrated
through
her
boots
.
<EOS>
Certainly
Mr.
Palliser
had
reason
to
be
angry
that
his
wife
should
have
remained
out
in
the
night
air
so
long
,
 
though
perhaps
not
with
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
And
then
she
began
to
think
of
what
had
been
told
her
;
and
to
try
to
think
of
what
,
under
such
circumstances
,
it
behoved
her
to
do
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
doubt
that
Lady
Glencora
had
intended
to
declare
that
,
if
opportunity
offered
itself
,
she
would
leave
her
husband
,
and
put
herself
under
the
protection
of
Mr.
Fitzgerald
;
and
Alice
,
moreover
,
had
become
painfully
conscious
that
the
poor
deluded
unreasoning
creature
had
taught
herself
to
think
that
she
might
excuse
herself
for
this
sin
to
her
own
conscience
by
the
fact
that
she
was
childless
,
and
that
she
might
thus
give
to
the
man
who
had
married
her
an
opportunity
of
seeking
another
wife
who
might
give
him
an
heir
.
<EOS>
Alice
well
knew
how
insufficient
such
an
excuse
would
be
even
to
the
wretched
woman
who
had
framed
it
for
herself
.
<EOS>
But
still
it
would
operate
,
 
manifestly
had
already
operated
,
on
her
mind
,
teaching
her
to
hope
that
good
might
come
out
of
evil
.
<EOS>
Alice
,
who
was
perfectly
clearsighted
as
regarded
her
cousin
,
however
much
impaired
her
vision
might
have
been
with
reference
to
herself
,
saw
nothing
but
absolute
ruin
,
ruin
of
the
worst
and
most
intolerable
description
,
in
the
plan
which
Lady
Glencora
seemed
to
have
formed
.
<EOS>
To
her
it
was
black
in
the
depths
of
hell
;
and
she
knew
that
to
Glencora
<EOS>
also
it
was
black
.
<EOS>
"
I
loathe
myself
,
"
Glencora
had
said
,
"
and
the
thing
that
I
am
thinking
of
.
"
  
<EOS>
What
was
Alice
to
do
under
these
circumstances
?
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
,
she
was
aware
,
had
quarrelled
with
her
;
for
in
his
silent
way
he
had
first
shown
that
he
had
trusted
her
as
his
wife
's
friend
;
and
then
,
on
this
evening
,
he
had
shown
that
he
had
ceased
to
trust
her
.
<EOS>
But
she
cared
little
for
this
.
<EOS>
If
she
told
him
that
she
wished
to
speak
to
him
,
he
would
listen
,
let
his
opinion
of
her
be
what
it
might
;
and
having
listened
he
would
surely
act
in
some
way
that
would
serve
to
save
his
wife
.
<EOS>
What
Mr.
Palliser
might
think
of
herself
,
Alice
cared
but
little
.
  
<EOS>
But
then
there
came
to
her
an
idea
that
was
in
every
respect
feminine
,
 
that
in
such
a
matter
she
had
no
right
to
betray
her
friend
.
<EOS>
When
one
woman
tells
the
story
of
her
love
to
another
woman
,
the
confidant
always
feels
that
she
will
be
a
traitor
if
she
reveals
the
secret
.
<EOS>
Had
Lady
Glencora
made
Alice
believe
that
she
meditated
murder
,
or
robbery
,
Alice
would
have
had
no
difficulty
in
telling
the
tale
,
and
thus
preventing
the
crime
.
<EOS>
But
now
she
hesitated
,
feeling
that
she
would
disgrace
herself
by
betraying
her
friend
.
<EOS>
And
,
after
all
,
was
it
not
more
than
probable
that
Glencora
had
no
intention
of
carrying
out
a
threat
the
very
thought
of
which
must
be
terrible
to
herself
?
  
<EOS>
As
she
was
thinking
of
all
this
,
sitting
in
her
dressing
-
gown
close
over
the
fire
,
there
came
a
loud
knock
at
the
door
,
which
,
as
she
had
turned
the
key
,
she
was
forced
to
answer
in
person
.
<EOS>
She
opened
the
door
,
and
there
was
Iphigenia
Palliser
,
Jeffrey
's
cousin
,
and
Mr.
Palliser
's
cousin
.
"
<EOS>
Miss
Vavasor
,
"
she
said
,
"
I
know
that
I
am
taking
a
great
liberty
,
but
may
I
come
into
your
room
for
a
few
minutes
?
<EOS>
I
so
much
wish
to
speak
to
you
!
"
<EOS>
Alice
of
course
bade
her
enter
,
and
placed
a
chair
for
her
by
the
fire
.
  
<EOS>
Alice
Vavasor
had
made
very
little
intimacy
with
either
of
the
two
Miss
Pallisers
.
<EOS>
It
had
seemed
to
herself
as
though
there
had
been
two
parties
in
the
house
,
and
that
she
had
belonged
to
the
one
which
was
headed
by
the
wife
,
whereas
the
Miss
Pallisers
had
been
naturally
attached
to
that
of
the
husband
.
<EOS>
These
ladies
,
as
she
had
already
seen
,
almost
idolized
their
cousin
;
and
though
Plantagenet
Palliser
had
till
lately
treated
Alice
with
the
greatest
personal
courtesy
,
there
had
been
no
intimacy
of
friendship
between
them
,
and
consequently
none
between
her
and
his
special
adherents
.
<EOS>
Nor
was
either
of
these
ladies
prone
to
sudden
friendship
with
such
a
one
as
Alice
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
A
sudden
friendship
,
with
a
snuffy
president
of
a
foreign
learned
society
,
with
some
personally
unknown
lady
employed
on
female
emigration
,
was
very
much
in
their
way
.
<EOS>
But
Alice
had
not
shown
herself
to
be
useful
or
learned
,
and
her
special
intimacy
with
Lady
Glencora
had
marked
her
out
as
in
some
sort
separated
from
them
and
their
ways
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
that
I
am
intruding
,
"
said
Miss
Palliser
,
as
though
she
were
almost
afraid
of
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
dear
,
no
,
"
said
Alice
.
<EOS>
"
If
I
can
do
anything
for
you
I
shall
be
very
happy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
going
to
-
morrow
,
and
if
I
did
not
speak
to
you
now
I
should
have
no
other
opportunity
.
<EOS>
Glencora
seems
to
be
very
much
attached
to
you
,
and
we
all
thought
it
so
good
a
thing
that
she
should
have
such
a
friend
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
have
not
all
changed
your
minds
,
"
said
Alice
,
with
a
faint
smile
,
thinking
as
she
spoke
that
the
"
all
"
must
have
been
specially
intended
to
include
the
master
of
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
no
;
 
by
no
means
.
<EOS>
I
did
not
mean
that
.
<EOS>
My
cousin
,
Mr.
Palliser
,
I
mean
,
liked
you
so
much
when
you
came
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
he
does
not
like
me
quite
so
much
now
,
because
I
went
out
in
the
moonlight
with
his
wife
.
<EOS>
Is
n't
that
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
;
 
no
,
Miss
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
I
had
not
intended
to
mention
that
at
all
.
<EOS>
I
had
not
indeed
.
<EOS>
I
have
seen
him
certainly
since
you
came
in
,
 
just
for
a
minute
,
and
he
is
vexed
.
<EOS>
But
it
is
not
about
that
that
I
would
speak
to
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
saw
plainly
enough
that
he
was
angry
with
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
thought
you
would
have
brought
her
in
earlier
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
why
should
he
think
that
I
can
manage
his
wife
?
<EOS>
She
was
the
mistress
out
there
as
she
is
in
here
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
has
been
unreasonable
.
<EOS>
Not
that
it
signifies
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
he
has
been
unreasonable
;
I
do
n't
,
indeed
,
Miss
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
He
has
certainly
been
vexed
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
he
has
much
to
vex
him
.
<EOS>
You
see
,
Glencora
is
very
young
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Bott
also
had
declared
that
Lady
Glencora
was
very
young
.
<EOS>
It
was
probable
,
therefore
,
that
that
special
phrase
had
been
used
in
some
discussion
among
Mr.
Palliser
's
party
as
to
Glencora
's
foibles
.
<EOS>
So
thought
Alice
as
the
remembrance
of
the
word
came
upon
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
is
not
younger
than
when
Mr.
Palliser
married
her
,
"
Alice
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
mean
that
if
a
man
marries
a
young
wife
he
must
put
up
with
the
trouble
.
<EOS>
That
is
a
matter
of
course
.
<EOS>
But
their
ages
,
in
truth
,
are
very
suitable
.
<EOS>
My
cousin
himself
is
not
yet
thirty
.
<EOS>
When
I
say
that
Glencora
is
young
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
You
mean
that
she
is
younger
in
spirit
,
and
perhaps
in
conduct
,
than
he
had
expected
to
find
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
are
not
to
suppose
that
he
complains
,
Miss
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
He
is
much
too
proud
for
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
hope
so
,
"
said
Alice
,
thinking
of
Mr.
Bott
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hardly
know
how
to
explain
to
you
what
I
wish
to
say
,
or
how
far
I
may
be
justified
in
supposing
that
you
will
believe
me
to
be
acting
solely
on
Glencora
's
behalf
.
<EOS>
I
think
you
have
some
influence
with
her
;
 
and
I
know
no
one
else
that
has
any
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
friendship
with
her
is
not
of
very
long
date
,
Miss
Palliser
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
it
,
but
still
there
is
the
fact
.
<EOS>
Am
I
not
right
in
supposing
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
In
supposing
what
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
In
supposing
that
you
had
heard
the
name
of
Mr.
Fitzgerald
as
connected
with
Glencora
's
before
her
marriage
with
my
cousin
?
"
  
Alice
paused
a
moment
before
she
answered
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
had
,
"
she
then
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
think
you
were
agreed
,
with
her
other
relations
,
that
such
a
marriage
would
have
been
very
dreadful
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
spoke
of
the
matter
in
the
presence
of
any
relatives
of
Glencora
's
.
<EOS>
You
must
understand
,
Miss
Palliser
,
that
though
I
am
her
far
-
away
cousin
,
I
do
not
even
know
her
nearest
connections
.
<EOS>
I
never
saw
Lady
Midlothian
till
she
came
here
the
other
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
advised
her
to
abandon
Mr.
Fitzgerald
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Never
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
she
was
much
with
you
,
just
at
that
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
used
to
see
her
,
certainly
.
"
  
<EOS>
Then
there
was
a
pause
,
and
Miss
Palliser
,
in
truth
,
scarcely
knew
how
to
go
on
.
<EOS>
There
had
been
a
hardness
about
Alice
which
her
visitor
had
not
expected
,
 
an
unwillingness
to
speak
or
even
to
listen
,
which
made
Miss
Palliser
almost
wish
that
she
were
out
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
She
had
,
however
,
mentioned
Burgo
Fitzgerald
's
name
,
and
out
of
the
room
now
she
could
not
go
without
explaining
why
she
had
done
so
.
<EOS>
But
at
this
point
Alice
came
suddenly
to
her
assistance
.
  
<EOS>
"
Just
then
she
was
often
with
me
,
"
said
Alice
,
continuing
her
reply
;
"
and
there
was
much
talk
between
us
about
Mr.
Fitzgerald
.
<EOS>
What
was
my
advice
then
can
be
of
little
matter
;
but
in
this
we
shall
be
both
agreed
,
Miss
Palliser
,
that
Glencora
now
should
certainly
not
be
called
upon
to
be
in
his
company
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
has
told
you
,
then
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
;
 
she
has
told
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
he
is
to
be
at
Lady
Monk
's
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
has
told
me
that
Mr.
Palliser
expects
her
to
meet
him
at
the
place
to
which
they
are
going
when
they
leave
the
Duke
's
,
and
that
she
thinks
it
hard
that
she
should
be
subjected
to
such
a
trial
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
should
be
no
trial
,
Miss
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
can
it
be
otherwise
?
<EOS>
Come
,
Miss
Palliser
;
if
you
are
her
friend
,
be
fair
to
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
her
friend
;
 
but
I
am
,
above
everything
,
my
cousin
's
friend
.
<EOS>
He
has
told
me
that
she
has
complained
of
having
to
meet
this
man
.
<EOS>
He
declares
that
it
should
be
nothing
to
her
,
and
that
the
fear
is
an
idle
folly
.
<EOS>
It
should
be
nothing
to
her
,
but
still
the
fear
may
not
be
idle
.
<EOS>
Is
there
any
reason
,
 
any
real
reason
,
 
why
she
should
not
go
?
<EOS>
Miss
Vavasor
,
I
conjure
you
to
tell
me
,
 
even
though
in
doing
so
you
must
cast
so
deep
reproach
upon
her
name
!
<EOS>
Anything
will
be
better
than
utter
disgrace
and
sin
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
conceive
that
I
cast
no
reproach
upon
her
in
saying
that
there
is
great
reason
why
she
should
not
go
to
Monkshade
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
think
there
is
absolute
grounds
for
interference
?
<EOS>
I
must
tell
him
,
you
know
,
openly
what
he
would
have
to
fear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
 
nay
,
Miss
Palliser
,
I
know
,
 
that
there
is
ample
reason
why
you
should
save
her
from
being
taken
to
Monkshade
,
if
you
have
the
power
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
only
do
it
,
or
attempt
to
do
it
,
by
telling
him
just
what
you
tell
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
tell
him
.
<EOS>
You
must
have
thought
of
that
,
I
suppose
,
before
you
came
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
 
yes
,
Miss
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
I
had
thought
of
it
.
<EOS>
No
doubt
I
had
thought
of
it
.
<EOS>
But
I
had
believed
all
through
that
you
would
assure
me
that
there
was
no
danger
.
<EOS>
I
believed
that
you
would
have
said
that
she
was
innocent
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
she
is
innocent
,
"
said
Alice
,
rising
from
her
chair
,
as
though
she
might
thus
give
emphasis
to
words
which
she
hardly
dared
to
speak
above
a
whisper
.
<EOS>
"
She
is
innocent
.
<EOS>
Who
accuses
her
of
guilt
?
<EOS>
You
ask
me
a
question
on
his
behalf
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
On
hers
 
and
on
his
,
Miss
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
question
which
I
feel
myself
bound
to
answer
truly
,
 
to
answer
with
reference
to
the
welfare
of
them
both
;
but
I
will
not
have
it
said
that
I
accuse
her
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
attached
to
Mr.
Fitzgerald
when
your
cousin
married
her
.
<EOS>
He
knew
that
this
had
been
the
case
.
<EOS>
She
told
him
the
whole
truth
.
<EOS>
In
a
worldly
point
of
view
her
marriage
with
Mr.
Fitzgerald
would
probably
have
been
very
imprudent
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
would
have
been
utterly
ruinous
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
so
;
I
say
nothing
about
that
.
<EOS>
But
as
it
turned
out
,
she
gave
up
her
own
wishes
and
married
your
cousin
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
about
her
own
wishes
,
Miss
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
what
she
did
.
<EOS>
She
would
have
married
Mr.
Fitzgerald
,
had
she
not
been
hindered
by
the
advice
of
those
around
her
.
<EOS>
It
can
not
be
supposed
that
she
has
forgotten
him
in
so
short
a
time
.
<EOS>
There
can
be
no
guilt
in
her
remembrance
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
guilt
in
loving
any
other
than
her
husband
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
,
Miss
Palliser
,
it
was
her
marriage
that
was
guilty
,
and
not
her
love
.
<EOS>
But
all
that
is
done
and
past
.
<EOS>
It
should
be
your
cousin
's
object
to
teach
her
to
forget
Mr.
Fitzgerald
,
and
he
will
not
do
that
by
taking
her
to
a
house
where
that
gentleman
is
staying
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
has
said
so
much
to
you
herself
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
that
I
need
declare
to
you
what
she
has
said
herself
.
<EOS>
You
have
asked
me
a
question
,
and
I
have
answered
it
,
and
I
am
thankful
to
you
for
having
asked
it
.
<EOS>
What
object
can
either
of
us
have
but
to
assist
her
in
her
position
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
to
save
him
from
dishonour
.
<EOS>
I
had
so
hoped
that
this
was
simply
a
childish
dread
on
her
part
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
so
.
<EOS>
It
is
no
childish
dread
.
<EOS>
If
you
have
the
power
to
prevent
her
going
to
Lady
Monk
's
,
I
implore
you
to
use
it
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
I
will
ask
you
to
promise
me
that
you
will
do
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
After
what
you
have
said
,
I
have
no
alternative
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Exactly
.
<EOS>
There
is
no
alternative
.
<EOS>
Either
for
his
sake
or
for
hers
,
there
is
none
.
"
  
<EOS>
Thereupon
Miss
Palliser
got
up
,
and
wishing
her
companion
good
night
,
took
her
departure
.
<EOS>
Throughout
the
interview
there
had
been
no
cordiality
of
feeling
between
them
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
pretence
of
friendship
,
even
as
they
were
parting
.
<EOS>
They
acknowledged
that
their
objects
were
different
.
<EOS>
That
of
Alice
was
to
save
Lady
Glencora
from
ruin
.
<EOS>
That
of
Miss
Palliser
was
to
save
her
cousin
from
disgrace
,
 
with
perhaps
some
further
honest
desire
to
prevent
sorrow
and
sin
.
<EOS>
One
loved
Lady
Glencora
,
and
the
other
clearly
did
not
love
her
.
<EOS>
But
,
nevertheless
,
Alice
felt
that
Miss
Palliser
,
in
coming
to
her
,
had
acted
well
,
and
that
to
herself
this
coming
had
afforded
immense
relief
.
<EOS>
Some
step
would
now
be
taken
to
prevent
that
meeting
which
she
had
so
deprecated
,
and
it
would
be
taken
without
any
great
violation
of
confidence
on
her
part
.
<EOS>
She
had
said
nothing
as
to
which
Lady
Glencora
could
feel
herself
aggrieved
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
next
morning
she
was
down
in
the
breakfast
-
room
soon
after
nine
,
and
had
not
been
in
the
room
many
minutes
before
Mr.
Palliser
entered
.
<EOS>
"
The
carriage
is
ordered
for
you
at
a
quarter
before
ten
,
"
he
said
,
"
and
I
have
come
down
to
give
you
your
breakfast
.
<EOS>
"
There
was
a
smile
on
his
face
as
he
spoke
,
and
Alice
could
see
that
he
intended
to
make
himself
pleasant
.
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
allow
me
to
give
you
yours
instead
?
"
said
she
.
<EOS>
But
as
it
happened
,
no
giving
on
either
side
was
needed
,
as
Alice
's
breakfast
was
brought
to
her
separately
.
  
<EOS>
"
Glencora
bids
me
say
that
she
will
be
down
immediately
,
"
said
Mr.
Palliser
.
  
<EOS>
Alice
then
made
some
inquiry
with
reference
to
the
effects
of
last
night
's
imprudence
,
which
received
only
a
half
-
pronounced
reply
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
was
willing
to
be
gracious
,
but
did
not
intend
to
be
understood
as
having
forgiven
the
offence
.
<EOS>
The
Miss
Pallisers
then
came
in
together
,
and
after
them
Mr.
Bott
,
closely
followed
by
Mrs.
Marsham
,
and
all
of
them
made
inquiries
after
Lady
Glencora
,
as
though
it
was
to
be
supposed
that
she
might
probably
be
in
a
perilous
state
after
what
she
had
undergone
on
the
previous
evening
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bott
was
particularly
anxious
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
frost
was
so
uncommonly
severe
,
"
said
he
,
"
that
any
delicate
person
like
Lady
Glencora
must
have
suffered
in
remaining
out
so
long
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
insinuation
that
Alice
was
not
a
delicate
person
and
that
,
as
regarded
her
,
the
severity
of
the
frost
was
of
no
moment
,
was
very
open
,
and
was
duly
appreciated
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bott
was
aware
that
his
great
patron
had
in
some
sort
changed
his
opinion
about
Miss
Vavasor
,
and
he
was
of
course
disposed
to
change
his
own
.
<EOS>
A
fortnight
since
Alice
might
have
been
as
delicate
as
she
pleased
in
Mr.
Bott
's
estimation
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
do
not
consider
Lady
Glencora
delicate
,
"
said
Alice
to
Mr.
Palliser
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
is
not
robust
,
"
said
the
husband
.
  
<EOS>
"
By
no
means
,
"
said
Mrs.
Marsham
.
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
,
no
,
"
said
Mr.
Bott
.
  
<EOS>
Alice
knew
that
she
was
being
accused
of
being
robust
herself
;
but
she
bore
it
in
silence
.
<EOS>
Ploughboys
and
milkmaids
are
robust
,
and
the
accusation
was
a
heavy
one
.
<EOS>
Alice
,
however
,
thought
that
she
would
not
have
minded
it
,
if
she
could
have
allowed
herself
to
reply
;
but
this
at
the
moment
of
her
going
away
she
could
not
do
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
she
is
as
strong
as
the
rest
of
us
,
"
said
Iphigenia
Palliser
,
who
felt
that
after
last
night
she
owed
something
to
Miss
Vavasor
.
  
<EOS>
"
As
some
of
us
,
"
said
Mr.
Bott
,
determined
to
persevere
in
his
accusation
.
  
<EOS>
At
this
moment
Lady
Glencora
entered
,
and
encountered
the
eager
inquiries
of
her
two
duennas
.
<EOS>
These
,
however
,
she
quickly
put
aside
,
and
made
her
way
up
to
Alice
.
<EOS>
"
The
last
morning
has
come
,
then
,
"
she
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
indeed
,
"
said
Alice
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
must
have
thought
that
I
was
never
going
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
On
the
other
hand
,
"
said
he
,
"
<EOS>
I
have
felt
much
obliged
to
you
for
staying
.
"
<EOS>
But
he
said
it
coldly
;
and
Alice
began
to
wish
that
she
had
never
seen
Matching
Priory
.
  
<EOS>
"
Obliged
!
"
exclaimed
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
tell
you
how
much
obliged
I
am
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
Alice
,
I
wish
you
were
going
to
stay
with
us
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
are
leaving
this
in
a
week
's
time
,
"
said
Mr.
Palliser
.
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
we
are
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
With
all
my
heart
I
wish
we
were
not
.
<EOS>
Dear
Alice
!
<EOS>
I
suppose
we
shall
not
meet
till
we
are
all
in
town
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
let
me
know
when
you
come
up
,
"
said
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
send
to
you
instantly
;
and
,
Alice
,
I
will
write
to
you
from
Gatherum
,
 
or
from
Monkshade
.
"
  
<EOS>
Alice
could
not
help
looking
around
and
catching
Miss
Palliser
's
eye
.
<EOS>
Miss
Palliser
was
standing
with
her
foot
on
the
fender
,
but
was
so
placed
that
she
could
see
Alice
.
<EOS>
She
made
a
slight
sign
with
her
head
,
as
much
as
to
say
that
Lady
Glencora
must
have
no
opportunity
of
writing
from
the
latter
place
;
but
she
said
nothing
.
  
<EOS>
Then
the
carriage
was
announced
,
and
Mr.
Palliser
took
Alice
out
on
his
arm
.
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
come
to
the
door
,
Glencora
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
especially
wish
you
not
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
"
The
two
cousins
then
kissed
each
other
,
and
Alice
went
away
to
the
carriage
.
  
<EOS>
"
Good
-
bye
,
Miss
Vavasor
,
"
said
Mr.
Palliser
;
but
he
expressed
no
wish
that
he
might
see
her
again
as
his
guest
at
Matching
Priory
.
  
<EOS>
Alice
,
as
she
was
driven
in
solitary
grandeur
to
the
railway
station
,
could
not
but
wish
that
she
had
never
gone
there
.
   
<EOS>
Burgo
Fitzgerald
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
night
before
Christmas
Eve
two
men
were
sitting
together
in
George
Vavasor
's
rooms
in
Cecil
Street
.
<EOS>
It
was
past
twelve
o'clock
,
and
they
were
both
smoking
;
there
were
square
bottles
on
the
table
containing
spirits
,
with
hot
water
and
cold
water
in
jugs
,
and
one
of
the
two
men
was
using
,
and
had
been
using
,
these
materials
for
enjoyment
.
<EOS>
Vavasor
had
not
been
drinking
,
nor
did
it
appear
as
though
he
intended
to
begin
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
little
weak
brandy
and
water
in
a
glass
by
his
side
,
but
there
it
had
remained
untouched
for
the
last
twenty
minutes
.
<EOS>
His
companion
,
however
,
had
twice
in
that
time
replenished
his
beaker
,
and
was
now
puffing
out
the
smoke
of
his
pipe
with
the
fury
of
a
steamer
's
funnel
when
she
has
not
yet
burned
the
black
off
her
last
instalment
of
fresh
coals
.
<EOS>
This
man
was
Burgo
Fitzgerald
.
<EOS>
He
was
as
handsome
as
ever
;
 
a
man
whom
neither
man
nor
woman
could
help
regarding
as
a
thing
beautiful
to
behold
;
 
but
not
the
less
was
there
in
his
eyes
and
cheeks
a
look
of
haggard
dissipation
,
 
of
riotous
living
,
which
had
become
wearisome
,
by
its
continuance
,
even
to
himself
,
 
that
told
to
all
who
saw
him
much
of
the
history
of
his
life
.
<EOS>
Most
men
who
drink
at
nights
,
and
are
out
till
cockcrow
doing
deeds
of
darkness
,
become
red
in
their
faces
,
have
pimpled
cheeks
and
watery
eyes
,
and
are
bloated
and
not
comfortable
to
be
seen
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
kind
dispensation
of
Providence
who
thus
affords
to
such
sinners
a
visible
sign
,
to
be
seen
day
by
day
,
of
the
injury
which
is
being
done
.
<EOS>
The
first
approach
of
a
carbuncle
on
the
nose
,
about
the
age
of
thirty
,
has
stopped
many
a
man
from
drinking
.
<EOS>
No
one
likes
to
have
carbuncles
on
his
nose
,
or
to
appear
before
his
female
friends
with
eyes
which
look
as
though
they
were
swimming
in
grog
.
<EOS>
But
to
Burgo
Fitzgerald
Providence
in
her
anger
had
not
afforded
this
protection
.
<EOS>
He
became
at
times
pale
,
sallow
,
worn
,
and
haggard
.
<EOS>
He
grew
thin
,
and
still
thinner
.
<EOS>
At
times
he
had
been
ill
to
death
's
door
.
<EOS>
Among
his
intimate
friends
there
were
those
who
heard
him
declare
frequently
that
his
liver
had
become
useless
to
him
;
and
that
,
as
for
gastric
juices
,
he
had
none
left
to
him
.
<EOS>
But
still
his
beauty
remained
.
<EOS>
The
perfect
form
of
his
almost
god
-
like
face
was
the
same
as
ever
,
and
the
brightness
of
his
bright
blue
eye
was
never
quenched
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
present
occasion
he
had
come
to
Vavasor
's
room
with
the
object
of
asking
from
him
certain
assistance
,
and
perhaps
also
some
amount
of
advice
.
<EOS>
But
as
regarded
the
latter
article
he
was
,
I
think
,
in
the
state
of
most
men
when
they
seek
for
counsellors
who
shall
counsel
them
to
do
evil
.
<EOS>
Advice
administered
in
accordance
with
his
own
views
would
give
him
comfortable
encouragement
,
but
advice
on
the
other
side
he
was
prepared
to
disregard
altogether
.
<EOS>
These
two
men
had
known
each
other
long
,
and
a
close
intimacy
had
existed
between
them
in
the
days
past
,
previous
to
Lady
Glencora
's
engagement
with
Mr.
Palliser
.
<EOS>
When
Lady
Glencora
endeavoured
,
vainly
as
we
know
,
to
obtain
aid
from
Alice
Vavasor
,
Burgo
had
been
instigated
to
believe
that
Alice
's
cousin
might
assist
him
.
<EOS>
Any
such
assistance
George
Vavasor
would
have
been
quite
ready
to
give
.
<EOS>
Some
pecuniary
assistance
he
had
given
,
he
at
that
time
having
been
in
good
funds
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
he
had
for
a
moment
induced
Burgo
to
think
that
he
could
obtain
for
the
pair
the
use
of
the
house
in
Queen
Anne
Street
as
a
point
at
which
they
might
meet
,
and
from
whence
they
might
start
on
their
journey
of
love
.
<EOS>
All
that
was
over
.
<EOS>
Those
hopes
had
been
frustrated
,
and
Lady
Glencora
M'Cluskie
had
become
Lady
Glencora
Palliser
and
not
Lady
Glencora
Fitzgerald
.
<EOS>
But
now
other
hopes
had
sprung
up
,
and
Burgo
was
again
looking
to
his
friend
for
assistance
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
she
would
,
"
Burgo
said
,
as
he
lifted
the
glass
to
his
mouth
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
thing
of
that
sort
that
a
man
can
only
believe
,
 
perhaps
only
hope
,
 
till
he
has
tried
.
<EOS>
I
know
that
she
is
not
happy
with
him
,
and
I
have
made
up
my
mind
that
I
will
at
least
ask
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
he
would
have
her
fortune
all
the
same
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
how
that
would
be
.
<EOS>
I
have
n't
inquired
,
and
I
do
n't
mean
to
inquire
.
<EOS>
Of
course
I
do
n't
expect
you
or
any
one
else
to
believe
me
,
but
her
money
has
no
bearing
on
the
question
now
.
<EOS>
Heaven
knows
I
want
money
bad
enough
,
but
I
would
n't
take
away
another
man
's
wife
for
money
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
mean
to
say
you
think
it
would
be
wicked
.
<EOS>
I
supposed
you
to
be
above
those
prejudices
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
all
very
well
for
you
to
chaff
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
no
chaff
at
all
.
<EOS>
I
tell
you
fairly
I
would
n't
run
away
with
any
man
's
wife
.
<EOS>
I
have
an
old
-
fashioned
idea
that
when
a
man
has
got
a
wife
he
ought
to
be
allowed
to
keep
her
.
<EOS>
Public
opinion
,
I
know
,
is
against
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
he
ran
away
with
my
wife
,
"
said
Burgo
,
with
emphasis
;
"
that
's
the
way
I
look
at
it
.
<EOS>
She
was
engaged
to
me
first
;
and
she
really
loved
me
,
while
she
never
cared
for
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nevertheless
,
marriage
is
marriage
,
and
the
law
is
against
you
.
<EOS>
But
if
I
did
go
in
for
such
a
troublesome
job
at
all
,
I
certainly
should
keep
an
eye
upon
the
money
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
can
make
no
difference
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
did
make
a
difference
,
I
suppose
,
when
you
first
thought
of
marrying
her
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
it
did
.
<EOS>
My
people
brought
us
together
because
she
had
a
large
fortune
and
I
had
none
.
<EOS>
There
's
no
doubt
in
the
world
about
that
.
<EOS>
And
I
'll
tell
you
what
<EOS>
;
I
believe
that
old
harridan
of
an
aunt
of
mine
is
willing
to
do
the
same
thing
now
again
.
<EOS>
Of
course
she
does
n't
say
as
much
.
<EOS>
She
would
n't
dare
do
that
,
but
I
do
believe
she
means
it
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
where
she
expects
to
go
to
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
grateful
on
your
part
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
soul
I
hate
her
.
<EOS>
I
do
indeed
.
<EOS>
It
is
n't
love
for
me
now
so
much
as
downright
malice
against
Palliser
,
because
he
baulked
her
project
before
.
<EOS>
She
is
a
wicked
old
woman
.
<EOS>
Some
of
us
fellows
are
wicked
enough
 
you
and
I
for
instance
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
Thank
you
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
,
however
,
that
I
am
qualified
to
run
in
a
curricle
with
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
we
are
angels
to
such
an
old
she
-
devil
as
that
.
<EOS>
You
may
believe
me
or
not
,
as
you
like
.
 
<EOS>
I
dare
say
you
wo
n't
believe
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
say
I
do
,
at
any
rate
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
truth
is
,
I
want
to
get
her
,
partly
because
I
love
her
;
but
chiefly
because
I
do
believe
in
my
heart
that
she
loves
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
for
her
sake
then
!
<EOS>
You
are
ready
to
sacrifice
yourself
to
do
her
a
good
turn
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
As
for
sacrificing
myself
,
that
's
done
.
<EOS>
I
'm
a
man
utterly
ruined
and
would
cut
my
throat
to
-
morrow
for
the
sake
of
my
relations
,
if
I
cared
enough
about
them
.
<EOS>
I
know
my
own
condition
pretty
well
.
<EOS>
I
have
made
a
shipwreck
of
everything
,
and
have
now
only
got
to
go
down
among
the
breakers
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Only
you
would
like
to
take
Lady
Glencora
with
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
by
heavens
!
<EOS>
But
sometimes
,
when
I
do
think
about
it
at
all
,
 
which
I
do
as
seldom
as
I
can
,
 
it
seems
to
me
that
I
might
still
become
a
different
fellow
if
it
were
possible
for
me
to
marry
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Had
you
married
her
when
she
was
free
to
marry
any
one
and
when
her
money
was
her
own
,
it
might
have
been
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
would
be
quite
as
much
so
now
.
<EOS>
I
do
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
If
I
could
get
her
once
,
say
to
Italy
,
or
perhaps
to
Greece
<EOS>
,
I
think
I
could
treat
her
well
,
and
live
with
her
quietly
.
<EOS>
I
know
that
I
would
try
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Without
the
assistance
of
brandy
and
cigars
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
"
  
"
And
without
any
money
.
<EOS>
"

With
only
a
little
.
<EOS>
I
know
you
'll
laugh
at
me
;
but
I
make
pictures
to
myself
of
a
sort
of
life
which
I
think
would
suit
us
,
and
be
very
different
from
this
hideous
way
of
living
,
with
which
I
have
become
so
sick
that
I
loathe
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Something
like
Juan
and
Haidée
,
with
Planty
Pall
coming
after
you
,
like
old
Lambro
.
<EOS>
"
By
the
nickname
of
Planty
Pall
George
Vavasor
intended
to
designate
Lady
Glencora
's
present
husband
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
'd
get
a
divorce
,
of
course
,
and
then
we
should
be
married
.
<EOS>
I
really
do
n't
think
he
'd
dislike
it
,
when
it
was
all
done
.
<EOS>
They
tell
me
he
does
n't
care
for
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
seen
her
since
her
marriage
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
twice
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
have
spoken
to
her
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Once
only
,
 
so
as
to
be
able
to
do
more
than
ask
her
if
she
were
well
.
<EOS>
Once
,
for
about
two
minutes
,
I
did
speak
to
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
did
she
say
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
said
it
would
be
better
that
we
should
not
meet
.
<EOS>
When
she
said
that
,
I
knew
that
she
was
still
fond
of
me
.
<EOS>
I
could
have
fallen
at
her
feet
that
moment
,
only
the
room
was
full
of
people
.
<EOS>
I
do
think
that
she
is
fond
of
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Vavasor
paused
a
few
minutes
.
<EOS>
"
I
dare
say
she
is
fond
of
you
,
"
he
then
said
;
"
but
whether
she
has
pluck
for
such
a
thing
as
this
,
is
more
than
I
can
say
.
<EOS>
Probably
she
has
not
.
<EOS>
And
if
she
has
,
probably
you
would
fail
in
carrying
out
your
plan
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
get
a
little
money
first
,
"
said
Burgo
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
that
's
an
operation
which
no
doubt
you
find
more
difficult
every
day
,
as
you
grow
older
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
seems
to
be
much
the
same
sort
of
thing
.
<EOS>
I
went
to
Magruin
this
morning
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
's
the
fellow
that
lives
out
near
Gray
's
Inn
Lane
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Just
beyond
the
Foundling
Hospital
.
<EOS>
I
went
to
him
,
and
he
was
quite
civil
about
it
.
<EOS>
He
says
I
owe
him
over
three
thousand
pounds
,
but
that
does
n't
seem
to
make
any
difference
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
much
did
you
ever
have
from
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
recollect
that
I
ever
absolutely
had
any
money
.
<EOS>
He
got
a
bill
of
mine
from
a
tailor
who
went
to
smash
,
and
he
kept
on
renewing
that
till
it
grew
to
be
ever
so
many
bills
.
<EOS>
I
think
he
did
once
let
me
have
twenty
-
four
pounds
,
 
but
certainly
never
more
than
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
he
says
he
'll
give
you
money
now
?
<EOS>
I
suppose
you
told
him
why
you
wanted
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
name
her
,
 
but
I
told
him
what
would
make
him
understand
that
I
hoped
to
get
off
with
a
lady
who
had
a
lot
of
tin
.
<EOS>
I
asked
him
for
two
hundred
and
fifty
.
<EOS>
He
says
he
'll
let
me
have
one
hundred
and
fifty
on
a
bill
at
two
months
for
five
hundred
,
 
with
your
name
to
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
With
my
name
to
it
!
<EOS>
That
's
kind
on
his
part
,
 
and
on
yours
too
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
I
ca
n't
take
it
up
at
the
end
of
two
months
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
dare
say
not
,
"
said
Vavasor
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
he
wo
n't
come
upon
you
then
,
 
nor
for
a
year
or
more
afterwards
.
<EOS>
I
did
pay
you
what
you
lent
me
before
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
you
did
.
<EOS>
I
always
thought
that
to
be
a
special
compliment
on
your
part
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
'll
find
I
'll
pull
you
through
now
in
some
way
.
<EOS>
If
I
do
n't
succeed
in
this
I
shall
go
off
the
hooks
altogether
soon
;
and
if
I
were
dead
my
people
would
pay
my
debts
then
.
<EOS>
"
  
Before
the
evening
was
over
Vavasor
promised
the
assistance
asked
of
him
.
<EOS>
He
knew
that
he
was
lending
his
name
to
a
man
who
was
utterly
ruined
,
and
putting
it
into
the
hands
of
another
man
who
was
absolutely
without
conscience
in
the
use
he
would
make
of
it
.
<EOS>
He
knew
that
he
was
creating
for
himself
trouble
,
and
in
all
probability
loss
,
which
he
was
ill
able
to
bear
.
<EOS>
But
the
thing
was
one
which
came
within
the
pale
of
his
laws
.
<EOS>
Such
assistance
as
that
he
might
ask
of
others
,
and
had
asked
and
received
before
now
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
reckless
deed
on
his
part
,
but
then
all
his
doings
were
reckless
.
<EOS>
It
was
consonant
with
his
mode
of
life
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
thought
you
would
,
old
fellow
,
"
said
Burgo
,
as
he
got
up
to
go
away
.
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
,
you
know
,
I
shall
pull
through
in
this
;
and
perhaps
,
after
all
,
some
part
of
her
fortune
will
come
with
her
.
<EOS>
If
so
you
'll
be
all
right
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
I
may
.
<EOS>
But
look
here
,
Burgo
,
 
do
n't
you
give
that
fellow
up
the
bill
till
you
've
got
the
money
into
your
fist
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
may
be
quite
easy
about
that
.
<EOS>
I
know
their
tricks
.
<EOS>
He
and
I
will
go
to
the
bank
together
,
and
we
shall
squabble
there
at
the
door
about
four
or
five
<EOS>
odd
sovereigns
<EOS>
,
 
and
at
last
I
shall
have
to
give
him
up
two
or
three
.
<EOS>
Beastly
old
robber
!
<EOS>
I
declare
I
think
he
's
worse
than
I
am
myself
.
"
<EOS>
Then
Burgo
Fitzgerald
took
a
little
more
brandy
and
water
and
went
away
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
living
at
this
time
in
the
house
of
one
of
his
relatives
in
Cavendish
Square
,
north
of
Oxford
Street
.
<EOS>
His
uncles
and
his
aunts
,
and
all
those
who
were
his
natural
friends
,
had
clung
to
him
with
a
tenacity
that
was
surprising
;
for
he
had
never
been
true
to
any
of
them
,
and
did
not
even
pretend
to
like
them
.
<EOS>
His
father
,
with
whom
for
many
years
he
had
not
been
on
speaking
terms
,
was
now
dead
;
but
he
had
sisters
whose
husbands
would
still
open
their
houses
to
him
,
either
in
London
or
in
the
country
;
 
would
open
their
houses
to
him
,
and
lend
him
their
horses
,
and
provide
him
with
every
luxury
which
the
rich
enjoy
,
 
except
ready
money
.
<EOS>
When
the
uttermost
stress
of
pecuniary
embarrassment
would
come
upon
him
,
they
would
pay
something
to
stave
off
the
immediate
evil
.
<EOS>
And
so
Burgo
went
on
.
<EOS>
Nobody
now
thought
of
saying
much
to
reproach
him
.
<EOS>
It
was
known
to
be
waste
of
words
,
and
trouble
in
vain
.
<EOS>
They
were
still
fond
of
him
because
he
was
beautiful
and
never
vain
of
his
beauty
;
 
because
in
the
midst
of
his
recklessness
there
was
always
about
him
a
certain
kindliness
which
made
him
pleasant
to
those
around
him
.
<EOS>
He
was
soft
and
gracious
with
children
,
and
would
be
very
courteous
to
his
lady
cousins
.
<EOS>
They
knew
that
as
a
man
he
was
worthless
,
but
nevertheless
they
loved
him
.
<EOS>
I
think
the
secret
of
it
was
chiefly
in
this
,
 
that
he
seemed
to
think
so
little
of
himself
.
  
<EOS>
But
now
as
he
walked
home
in
the
middle
of
the
night
from
Cecil
Street
to
Cavendish
Square
he
did
think
much
of
himself
.
<EOS>
Indeed
such
self
-
thoughts
come
naturally
to
all
men
,
be
their
outward
conduct
ever
so
reckless
.
<EOS>
Every
man
to
himself
is
the
centre
of
the
whole
world
;
 
the
axle
on
which
it
all
turns
.
<EOS>
All
knowledge
is
but
his
own
perception
of
the
things
around
him
.
<EOS>
All
love
,
and
care
for
others
,
and
solicitude
for
the
world
's
welfare
,
are
but
his
own
feelings
as
to
the
world
's
wants
and
the
world
's
merits
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
played
his
part
as
a
centre
of
all
things
very
badly
.
<EOS>
Of
that
he
was
very
well
aware
.
<EOS>
He
had
sense
enough
to
know
that
it
should
be
a
man
's
lot
to
earn
his
bread
after
some
fashion
,
and
he
often
told
himself
that
never
as
yet
had
he
earned
so
much
as
a
penny
roll
.
<EOS>
He
had
learned
to
comprehend
that
the
world
's
progress
depends
on
the
way
in
which
men
do
their
duty
by
each
other
,
 
that
the
progress
of
one
generation
depends
on
the
discharge
of
such
duties
by
that
which
preceded
it
;
 
and
he
knew
that
he
,
in
his
generation
,
had
done
nothing
to
promote
such
progress
.
<EOS>
He
thoroughly
despised
himself
,
 
if
there
might
be
any
good
in
that
!
<EOS>
But
on
such
occasions
as
these
,
when
the
wine
he
had
drunk
was
sufficient
only
to
drive
away
from
him
the
numbness
of
despair
,
when
he
was
all
alone
with
the
cold
night
air
upon
his
face
,
when
the
stars
were
bright
above
him
and
the
world
around
him
was
almost
quiet
,
he
would
still
ask
himself
whether
there
might
not
yet
be
,
even
for
him
,
some
hope
of
a
redemption
,
 
some
chance
of
a
better
life
in
store
for
him
.
<EOS>
He
was
still
young
,
 
wanting
some
years
of
thirty
.
<EOS>
Could
there
be
,
even
for
him
,
some
mode
of
extrication
from
his
misery
?
  
<EOS>
We
know
what
was
the
mode
which
now
,
at
this
moment
,
was
suggesting
itself
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
was
proposing
to
himself
,
as
the
best
thing
that
he
could
do
,
to
take
away
another
man
's
wife
and
make
himself
happy
with
her
!
<EOS>
What
he
had
said
to
Vavasor
as
to
disregarding
Lady
Glencora
's
money
had
been
perfectly
true
.
<EOS>
That
in
the
event
of
her
going
off
with
him
,
some
portion
of
her
enormous
wealth
would
still
cling
to
her
,
he
did
believe
.
<EOS>
Seeing
that
she
had
no
children
he
could
not
understand
where
else
it
should
all
go
.
<EOS>
But
he
thought
of
this
as
it
regarded
her
,
not
as
it
regarded
him
.
<EOS>
When
he
had
before
made
his
suit
to
her
,
 
<EOS>
a
suit
which
was
then
honourable
,
however
disadvantageous
it
might
have
seemed
to
be
to
her
 
he
had
made
in
his
mind
certain
calculations
as
to
the
good
things
which
would
result
to
him
if
he
were
successful
He
would
keep
hounds
,
and
have
three
or
four
horses
every
day
for
his
own
riding
,
and
he
would
have
no
more
interviews
with
Magruin
,
waiting
in
that
rogue
's
dingy
back
parlour
for
many
a
weary
wretched
half
-
hour
,
till
the
rogue
should
be
pleased
to
show
himself
.
<EOS>
So
far
he
had
been
mercenary
;
but
he
had
learned
to
love
the
girl
,
and
to
care
more
for
her
than
for
her
money
,
and
when
the
day
of
disappointment
came
upon
him
,
 
the
day
on
which
she
had
told
him
that
all
between
them
was
to
be
over
for
ever
,
 
he
had
,
for
a
few
hours
,
felt
the
loss
of
his
love
more
than
the
loss
of
his
money
.
  
<EOS>
Then
he
had
had
no
further
hope
.
<EOS>
No
such
idea
as
that
which
now
filled
his
mind
had
then
come
upon
him
.
<EOS>
The
girl
had
gone
from
him
and
married
another
man
,
and
there
was
an
end
of
it
.
<EOS>
But
by
degrees
tidings
had
reached
him
that
she
was
not
happy
,
 
reaching
him
through
the
mouths
of
people
who
were
glad
to
exaggerate
all
that
they
had
heard
.
<EOS>
A
whole
tribe
of
his
female
relatives
had
been
anxious
to
promote
his
marriage
with
Lady
Glencora
M'Cluskie
,
declaring
that
,
after
all
that
was
come
and
gone
,
Burgo
would
come
forth
from
his
troubles
as
a
man
of
great
wealth
.
<EOS>
So
great
was
the
wealth
of
the
heiress
that
it
might
withstand
even
his
propensities
for
spending
.
<EOS>
That
whole
tribe
had
been
bitterly
disappointed
;
and
when
they
heard
that
Mr.
Palliser
's
marriage
had
given
him
no
child
,
and
that
Lady
Glencora
was
unhappy
,
 
they
made
their
remarks
in
triumph
rather
than
in
sorrow
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
say
that
they
looked
forward
approvingly
to
such
a
step
as
that
which
Burgo
now
wished
to
take
,
 
though
as
regarded
his
aunt
,
Lady
Monk
,
he
himself
had
accused
her
;
but
they
whispered
that
such
things
had
been
done
and
must
be
expected
,
when
marriages
were
made
up
as
had
been
that
marriage
between
Mr.
Palliser
and
his
bride
.
  
<EOS>
As
he
walked
on
,
thinking
of
his
project
,
he
strove
hard
to
cheat
himself
into
a
belief
that
he
would
do
a
good
thing
in
carrying
Lady
Glencora
away
from
her
husband
.
<EOS>
Bad
as
had
been
his
life
he
had
never
before
done
aught
so
bad
as
that
.
<EOS>
The
more
fixed
his
intention
became
,
the
more
thoroughly
he
came
to
perceive
how
great
and
grievous
was
the
crime
which
he
contemplated
.
<EOS>
To
elope
with
another
man
's
wife
no
longer
appeared
to
him
to
be
a
joke
at
which
such
men
as
he
might
smile
.
<EOS>
But
he
tried
to
think
that
in
this
case
there
would
be
special
circumstances
which
would
almost
justify
him
,
and
also
her
.
<EOS>
They
had
loved
each
other
and
had
sworn
to
love
each
other
with
constancy
.
<EOS>
There
had
been
no
change
in
the
feelings
or
even
in
the
wishes
of
either
of
them
.
<EOS>
But
cold
people
had
come
between
them
with
cold
calculations
,
and
had
separated
them
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
,
he
told
himself
,
made
to
marry
a
man
she
did
not
love
.
<EOS>
If
they
two
loved
each
other
truly
,
would
it
not
still
be
better
that
they
should
come
together
?
<EOS>
Would
not
the
sin
be
forgiven
on
account
of
the
injustice
which
had
been
done
to
them
?
<EOS>
Had
Mr.
Palliser
a
right
to
expect
more
from
a
wife
who
had
been
made
to
marry
him
without
loving
him
?
<EOS>
Then
he
reverted
to
those
dreams
of
a
life
of
love
,
in
some
sunny
country
,
of
which
he
had
spoken
to
Vavasor
,
and
he
strove
to
nourish
them
.
<EOS>
Vavasor
had
laughed
at
him
,
talking
of
Juan
and
Haidée
.
<EOS>
But
Vavasor
,
he
said
to
himself
,
was
a
hard
cold
man
,
who
had
no
touch
of
romance
in
his
character
.
<EOS>
He
would
not
be
laughed
out
of
his
plan
by
such
as
he
,
 
nor
would
he
be
frightened
by
the
threat
of
any
Lambro
who
might
come
after
him
,
whether
he
might
come
in
the
guise
of
indignant
uncle
or
injured
husband
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
crossed
from
Regent
Street
through
Hanover
Square
,
and
as
he
came
out
by
the
iron
gates
into
Oxford
Street
,
a
poor
wretched
girl
,
lightly
clad
in
thin
raiment
,
into
whose
bones
the
sharp
freezing
air
was
penetrating
,
asked
him
for
money
.
<EOS>
Would
he
give
her
something
to
get
drink
,
so
that
for
a
moment
she
might
feel
the
warmth
of
her
life
renewed
?
<EOS>
Such
midnight
petitions
were
common
enough
in
his
ears
,
and
he
was
passing
on
without
thinking
of
her
.
<EOS>
But
she
was
urgent
,
and
took
hold
of
him
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
For
love
of
God
,
"
she
said
,
"
if
it
's
only
a
penny
to
get
a
glass
of
gin
!
<EOS>
Feel
my
hand
,
 
how
cold
it
is
.
"
<EOS>
And
she
strove
to
put
it
up
against
his
face
.
  
<EOS>
He
looked
round
at
her
and
saw
that
she
was
very
young
,
 
sixteen
,
perhaps
,
at
the
most
,
and
that
she
had
once
,
 
nay
very
lately
,
 
been
exquisitely
pretty
.
<EOS>
There
still
lingered
about
her
eyes
some
remains
of
that
look
of
perfect
innocency
and
pure
faith
which
had
been
hers
not
more
than
twelve
months
since
.
<EOS>
And
now
,
at
midnight
,
in
the
middle
of
the
streets
,
she
was
praying
for
a
pennyworth
of
gin
,
as
the
only
comfort
she
knew
,
or
could
expect
!
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
cold
!
"
<EOS>
said
he
,
trying
to
speak
to
her
cheerily
.
  
<EOS>
"
Cold
!
"
said
she
,
repeating
the
word
,
and
striving
to
wrap
herself
closer
in
her
rags
,
as
she
shivered
 
"
Oh
God
!
<EOS>
if
you
knew
what
it
was
to
be
as
cold
as
I
am
!
<EOS>
I
have
nothing
in
the
world
,
 
not
one
penny
,
 
not
a
hole
to
lie
in
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
are
alike
then
,
"
said
Burgo
,
with
a
slight
low
laugh
.
<EOS>
"
I
also
have
nothing
.
<EOS>
You
can
not
be
poorer
than
I
am
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
poor
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
said
.
<EOS>
And
then
she
looked
up
into
his
face
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Gracious
;
how
beautiful
you
are
!
<EOS>
Such
as
you
are
never
poor
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
laughed
again
,
 
in
a
different
tone
.
<EOS>
He
always
laughed
when
any
one
told
him
of
his
beauty
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
a
deal
poorer
than
you
,
my
girl
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
nothing
.
<EOS>
I
have
thirty
thousand
pounds
worse
than
nothing
.
<EOS>
But
come
along
,
and
I
will
get
you
something
to
eat
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
?
"
said
she
,
eagerly
.
<EOS>
Then
looking
up
at
him
again
,
she
exclaimed
 
"
Oh
,
you
are
so
handsome
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
took
her
to
a
public
-
house
and
gave
her
bread
and
meat
and
beer
,
and
stood
by
her
while
she
ate
it
.
<EOS>
She
was
shy
with
him
then
,
and
would
fain
have
taken
it
to
a
corner
by
herself
,
had
he
allowed
her
.
<EOS>
He
perceived
this
,
and
turned
his
back
to
her
,
but
still
spoke
to
her
a
word
or
two
as
she
ate
.
<EOS>
The
woman
at
the
bar
who
served
him
looked
at
him
wonderingly
,
staring
into
his
face
;
and
the
pot
-
boy
woke
himself
thoroughly
that
he
might
look
at
Burgo
;
and
the
waterman
from
the
cab
-
stand
stared
at
him
;
and
women
who
came
in
for
gin
looked
almost
lovingly
up
into
his
eyes
.
<EOS>
He
regarded
them
all
not
at
all
,
showing
no
feeling
of
disgrace
at
his
position
,
and
no
desire
to
carry
himself
as
a
ruffler
.
<EOS>
He
quietly
paid
what
was
due
when
the
girl
had
finished
her
meal
,
and
then
walked
with
her
out
of
the
shop
.
"
<EOS>
And
now
,
"
said
he
,
"
what
must
I
do
with
you
?
<EOS>
If
I
give
you
a
shilling
can
you
get
a
bed
?
"
<EOS>
She
told
him
that
she
could
get
a
bed
for
sixpence
.
"
<EOS>
Then
keep
the
other
sixpence
for
your
breakfast
,
"
said
he
.
<EOS>
"
But
you
must
promise
me
that
you
will
buy
no
gin
to
-
night
.
"
<EOS>
She
promised
him
,
and
then
he
gave
her
his
hand
as
he
wished
her
good
night
;
 
his
hand
,
which
it
had
been
the
dearest
wish
of
Lady
Glencora
to
call
her
own
.
<EOS>
She
took
it
and
pressed
it
to
her
lips
.
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
might
once
see
you
again
,
"
she
said
,
"
because
you
are
so
good
and
so
beautiful
.
"
<EOS>
He
laughed
again
cheerily
,
and
walked
on
,
crossing
the
street
towards
Cavendish
Square
.
<EOS>
She
stood
looking
at
him
till
he
was
out
of
sight
,
and
then
as
she
moved
away
,
 
let
us
hope
to
the
bed
which
his
bounty
had
provided
,
and
not
to
a
gin
-
shop
,
 
she
exclaimed
to
herself
again
and
again
 
<EOS>
"
Gracious
,
how
beautiful
he
was
!
"
<EOS>
"
He
's
a
good
un
,
"
the
woman
at
the
public
-
house
had
said
as
soon
as
he
left
it
;
"
but
,
my
!
<EOS>
did
you
ever
see
a
man
's
face
handsome
as
that
fellow
's
?
"
  
<EOS>
Poor
Burgo
!
<EOS>
All
who
had
seen
him
since
life
had
begun
with
him
had
loved
him
and
striven
to
cherish
him
.
<EOS>
And
with
it
all
,
to
what
a
state
had
he
come
!
<EOS>
Poor
Burgo
!
<EOS>
had
his
eyes
been
less
brightly
blue
,
and
his
face
less
godlike
in
form
,
it
may
be
that
things
would
have
gone
better
with
him
.
<EOS>
A
sweeter
-
tempered
man
than
he
never
lived
,
 
nor
one
who
was
of
a
kinder
nature
.
<EOS>
At
this
moment
he
had
barely
money
about
him
to
take
him
down
to
his
aunt
's
house
at
Monkshade
,
and
as
he
had
promised
to
be
there
before
Christmas
Day
,
he
was
bound
to
start
on
the
next
morning
,
before
help
from
Mr.
Magruin
was
possible
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
out
of
his
very
narrow
funds
he
had
given
half
a
crown
to
comfort
the
poor
creature
who
had
spoken
to
him
in
the
street
.
   
<EOS>
Containing
a
Love
Letter
.
 
<EOS>
Vavasor
,
as
he
sat
alone
in
his
room
,
after
Fitzgerald
had
left
him
,
began
to
think
of
the
days
in
which
he
had
before
wished
to
assist
his
friend
in
his
views
with
reference
to
Lady
Glencora
;
 
or
rather
he
began
to
think
of
Alice
's
behaviour
then
,
and
of
Alice
's
words
.
<EOS>
Alice
had
steadfastly
refused
to
give
any
aid
.
<EOS>
No
less
likely
assistant
for
such
a
purpose
could
have
been
selected
.
<EOS>
But
she
had
been
very
earnest
in
declaring
that
it
was
Glencora
's
duty
to
stand
by
her
promise
to
Burgo
.
"
<EOS>
He
is
a
desperate
spendthrift
,
"
Kate
Vavasor
had
said
to
her
.
"
<EOS>
Then
let
her
teach
him
to
be
otherwise
,
"
Alice
had
answered
.
<EOS>
"
That
might
have
been
a
good
reason
for
refusing
his
offer
when
he
first
made
it
;
but
it
can
be
no
excuse
for
untruth
,
now
that
she
has
told
him
that
she
loves
him
!
"
<EOS>
"
If
a
woman
,
"
she
had
said
again
,
"
wo
n't
venture
her
fortune
for
the
man
she
loves
,
her
love
is
not
worth
having
.
<EOS>
"
All
this
George
Vavasor
remembered
now
;
and
as
he
remembered
it
he
asked
himself
whether
the
woman
that
had
once
loved
him
would
venture
her
fortune
for
him
still
.
  
<EOS>
Though
his
sister
had
pressed
him
on
the
subject
with
all
the
vehemence
that
she
could
use
,
he
had
hardly
hitherto
made
up
his
mind
that
he
really
desired
to
marry
Alice
.
<EOS>
There
had
grown
upon
him
lately
certain
Bohemian
propensities
,
 
a
love
of
absolute
independence
in
his
thoughts
as
well
as
actions
,
 
which
were
antagonistic
to
marriage
.
<EOS>
He
was
almost
inclined
to
think
that
marriage
was
an
old
-
fashioned
custom
,
fitted
indeed
well
enough
for
the
usual
dull
life
of
the
world
at
large
,
 
as
many
men
both
in
heathen
and
in
Christian
ages
have
taught
themselves
to
think
of
religion
,
 
but
which
was
not
adapted
to
his
advanced
intelligence
.
<EOS>
If
he
loved
any
woman
he
loved
his
cousin
Alice
.
<EOS>
If
he
thoroughly
respected
any
woman
he
respected
her
.
<EOS>
But
that
idea
of
tying
himself
down
to
a
household
was
in
itself
distasteful
to
him
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
thing
terrible
to
think
of
,
"
he
once
said
to
a
congenial
friend
in
these
days
of
his
life
,
"
that
a
man
should
give
permission
to
a
priest
to
tie
him
to
another
human
being
like
a
Siamese
twin
,
so
that
all
power
of
separate
and
solitary
action
should
be
taken
from
him
for
ever
!
<EOS>
The
beasts
of
the
field
do
not
treat
each
other
so
badly
.
<EOS>
They
neither
drink
themselves
drunk
,
nor
eat
themselves
stupid
;
 
nor
do
they
bind
themselves
together
in
a
union
which
both
would
have
to
hate
.
<EOS>
"
In
this
way
George
Vavasor
,
trying
to
imitate
the
wisdom
of
the
brutes
,
had
taught
himself
some
theories
of
a
peculiar
nature
.
<EOS>
But
,
nevertheless
,
as
he
thought
of
Alice
Vavasor
on
this
occasion
,
he
began
to
feel
that
if
a
Siamese
twin
were
necessary
for
him
,
she
of
all
others
was
the
woman
to
whom
he
would
wish
to
be
so
bound
.
  
<EOS>
And
if
he
did
it
at
all
,
he
must
do
it
now
.
<EOS>
Under
the
joint
instigation
of
himself
and
his
sister
,
 
as
he
thought
,
and
perhaps
not
altogether
without
reason
,
 
she
had
broken
her
engagement
with
Mr.
Grey
.
<EOS>
That
she
would
renew
it
again
if
left
to
herself
,
he
believed
probable
.
<EOS>
And
then
,
despite
that
advanced
intelligence
which
had
taught
him
to
regard
all
forms
and
ceremonies
with
the
eye
of
a
philosopher
,
he
had
still
enough
of
human
frailty
about
him
to
feel
keenly
alive
to
the
pleasure
of
taking
from
John
Grey
the
prize
which
John
Grey
had
so
nearly
taken
from
him
.
<EOS>
If
Alice
could
have
been
taught
to
think
as
he
did
as
to
the
absurdity
of
those
indissoluble
ties
,
that
would
have
been
better
.
<EOS>
But
nothing
would
have
been
more
impossible
than
the
teaching
of
such
a
lesson
to
his
cousin
Alice
.
<EOS>
George
Vavasor
was
a
man
of
courage
,
and
dared
do
most
things
;
 
but
he
would
not
have
dared
to
commence
the
teaching
of
such
a
lesson
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
And
now
,
at
this
moment
,
what
was
his
outlook
into
life
generally
?
<EOS>
He
had
very
high
ambition
,
and
a
fair
hope
of
gratifying
it
if
he
could
only
provide
that
things
should
go
well
with
him
for
a
year
or
so
.
<EOS>
He
was
still
a
poor
man
,
having
been
once
nearly
a
rich
man
;
but
still
so
much
of
the
result
of
his
nearly
acquired
riches
remained
to
him
,
that
on
the
strength
of
them
he
might
probably
find
his
way
into
Parliament
.
<EOS>
He
had
paid
the
cost
of
the
last
attempt
,
and
might
,
in
a
great
degree
,
carry
on
this
present
attempt
on
credit
.
<EOS>
If
he
succeeded
there
would
be
open
to
him
a
mode
of
life
,
agreeable
in
itself
,
and
honourable
among
men
.
<EOS>
But
how
was
he
to
bear
the
cost
of
this
for
the
next
year
,
or
the
next
two
years
?
<EOS>
His
grandfather
was
still
alive
,
and
would
probably
live
over
that
period
.
<EOS>
If
he
married
Alice
he
would
do
so
with
no
idea
of
cheating
her
out
of
her
money
.
<EOS>
She
should
learn
,
 
nay
,
she
had
already
learned
from
his
own
lips
,
 
how
perilous
was
his
enterprise
.
<EOS>
But
he
knew
her
to
be
a
woman
who
would
boldly
risk
all
in
money
,
though
no
consideration
would
induce
her
to
stir
a
hair
's
breadth
towards
danger
in
reputation
.
<EOS>
Towards
teaching
her
that
doctrine
at
which
I
have
hinted
,
he
would
not
have
dared
to
make
an
attempt
;
but
he
felt
that
he
should
have
no
repugnance
to
telling
her
that
he
wanted
to
spend
all
her
money
in
the
first
year
or
two
of
their
married
life
!
  
<EOS>
He
was
still
in
his
arm
-
chair
,
thinking
of
all
this
,
with
that
small
untasted
modicum
of
brandy
and
water
beside
him
,
when
he
heard
some
distant
Lambeth
clock
strike
three
from
over
the
river
.
<EOS>
Then
he
rose
from
his
seat
,
and
taking
the
candles
in
his
hand
,
sat
himself
down
at
a
writing
-
desk
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
"
I
need
n't
send
it
when
it
's
written
,
"
he
said
to
himself
,
"
and
the
chances
are
that
I
wo
n't
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Then
he
took
his
paper
,
and
wrote
as
follows
:
    
DEAR
ALICE
,
  
<EOS>
The
time
was
when
the
privilege
was
mine
of
beginning
my
letters
to
you
with
a
warmer
show
of
love
than
the
above
word
contains
,
 
when
I
might
and
did
call
you
dearest
;
but
I
lost
that
privilege
through
my
own
folly
,
and
since
that
it
has
been
accorded
to
another
.
<EOS>
But
you
have
found
,
 
with
a
thorough
honesty
of
purpose
than
which
I
know
nothing
greater
,
 
that
it
has
behoved
you
to
withdraw
that
privilege
also
.
<EOS>
I
need
hardly
say
that
I
should
not
have
written
as
I
now
write
,
had
you
not
found
it
expedient
to
do
as
you
have
done
.
<EOS>
I
now
once
again
ask
you
to
be
my
wife
.
<EOS>
In
spite
of
all
that
passed
in
those
old
days
,
 
of
all
the
selfish
folly
of
which
I
was
then
guilty
,
I
think
you
know
,
and
at
the
time
knew
,
that
I
ever
loved
you
.
<EOS>
I
claim
to
say
for
myself
that
my
love
to
you
was
true
from
first
to
last
,
and
I
claim
from
you
belief
for
that
statement
.
<EOS>
Indeed
I
do
not
think
that
you
ever
doubted
my
love
.
  
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
when
you
told
me
that
I
might
no
longer
hope
to
make
you
my
wife
,
I
had
no
word
of
remonstrance
that
I
could
utter
.
<EOS>
You
acted
as
any
woman
would
act
whom
love
had
not
made
a
fool
.
<EOS>
Then
came
the
episode
of
Mr.
Grey
;
and
bitter
as
have
been
my
feelings
whilst
that
engagement
lasted
,
I
never
made
any
attempt
to
come
between
you
and
the
life
you
had
chosen
.
<EOS>
In
saying
this
I
do
not
forget
the
words
which
I
spoke
last
summer
at
Basle
,
when
,
as
far
as
I
knew
,
you
still
intended
that
he
should
be
your
husband
.
<EOS>
But
what
I
said
then
was
nothing
to
that
which
,
with
much
violence
,
I
refrained
from
saying
.
<EOS>
Whether
you
remember
those
few
words
I
can
not
tell
;
but
certainly
you
would
not
have
remembered
them
,
 
would
not
even
have
noticed
them
,
 
had
your
heart
been
at
Nethercoats
.
  
<EOS>
But
all
this
is
nothing
.
<EOS>
You
are
now
again
a
free
woman
;
and
once
again
I
ask
you
to
be
my
wife
.
<EOS>
We
are
both
older
than
we
were
when
we
loved
before
,
and
will
both
be
prone
to
think
of
marriage
in
a
somewhat
different
light
.
<EOS>
Then
personal
love
for
each
other
was
most
in
our
thoughts
.
<EOS>
God
forbid
that
it
should
not
be
much
in
our
thoughts
now
!
<EOS>
Perhaps
I
am
deceiving
myself
in
saying
that
it
is
not
even
now
stronger
in
mine
than
any
other
consideration
.
<EOS>
But
we
have
both
reached
that
time
of
life
,
when
it
is
probable
that
in
any
proposition
of
marriage
we
should
think
more
of
our
adaptability
to
each
other
than
we
did
before
.
<EOS>
For
myself
I
know
that
there
is
much
in
my
character
and
disposition
to
make
me
unfit
to
marry
a
woman
of
the
common
stamp
.
<EOS>
You
know
my
mode
of
life
,
and
what
are
my
hopes
and
my
chances
of
success
.
<EOS>
I
run
great
risk
of
failing
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
that
I
shall
encounter
ruin
where
I
look
for
reputation
and
a
career
of
honour
.
<EOS>
The
chances
are
perhaps
more
in
favour
of
ruin
than
of
success
.
<EOS>
But
,
whatever
may
be
the
chances
,
I
shall
go
on
as
long
as
any
means
of
carrying
on
the
fight
are
at
my
disposal
.
<EOS>
If
you
were
my
wife
to
-
morrow
<EOS>
I
should
expect
to
use
your
money
,
if
it
were
needed
,
in
struggling
to
obtain
a
seat
in
Parliament
and
a
hearing
there
.
<EOS>
I
will
hardly
stoop
to
tell
you
that
I
do
not
ask
you
to
be
my
wife
for
the
sake
of
this
aid
;
 
but
if
you
were
to
become
my
wife
I
should
expect
all
your
cooperation
;
 
with
your
money
,
possibly
,
but
certainly
with
your
warmest
spirit
.
  
<EOS>
And
now
,
once
again
,
Alice
,
 
dearest
Alice
,
will
you
be
my
wife
?
<EOS>
I
have
been
punished
,
and
I
have
kissed
the
rod
,
 
as
I
never
kissed
any
other
rod
.
<EOS>
You
can
not
accuse
my
love
.
<EOS>
Since
the
time
in
which
I
might
sit
with
my
arm
round
your
waist
,
I
have
sat
with
<EOS>
it
round
no
other
waist
.
<EOS>
Since
your
lips
were
mine
,
no
other
lips
have
been
dear
to
me
.
<EOS>
Since
you
were
my
counsellor
,
I
have
had
no
other
counsellor
,
 
unless
it
be
poor
Kate
,
whose
wish
that
we
may
at
length
be
married
is
second
in
earnestness
only
to
my
own
.
<EOS>
Nor
do
I
think
you
will
doubt
my
repentance
.
<EOS>
Such
repentance
indeed
claims
no
merit
,
as
it
has
been
the
natural
result
of
the
loss
which
I
have
suffered
.
<EOS>
Providence
has
hitherto
been
very
good
to
me
in
not
having
made
that
loss
irremediable
by
your
marriage
with
Mr.
Grey
.
<EOS>
I
wish
you
now
to
consider
the
matter
well
,
and
to
tell
me
whether
you
can
pardon
me
and
still
love
me
.
<EOS>
Do
I
flatter
myself
when
I
feel
that
I
doubt
your
pardon
almost
more
than
I
doubt
your
love
?
  
<EOS>
Think
of
this
thing
in
all
its
bearings
before
you
answer
me
.
<EOS>
I
am
so
anxious
that
you
should
think
of
it
that
I
will
not
expect
your
reply
till
this
day
week
.
<EOS>
It
can
hardly
be
your
desire
to
go
through
life
unmarried
.
<EOS>
I
should
say
that
it
must
be
essential
to
your
ambition
that
you
should
join
your
lot
to
that
of
some
man
the
nature
of
whose
aspirations
would
be
like
to
your
own
.
<EOS>
It
is
because
this
was
not
so
<EOS>
as
regarded
him
whose
suit
you
had
accepted
,
that
you
found
yourself
at
last
obliged
to
part
from
him
.
<EOS>
May
I
not
say
that
with
us
there
would
be
no
such
difference
?
<EOS>
It
is
because
I
believe
that
in
this
respect
we
are
fitted
for
each
other
,
as
man
and
woman
seldom
are
fitted
,
that
I
once
again
ask
you
to
be
my
wife
.
  
<EOS>
This
will
reach
you
at
Vavasor
,
where
you
will
now
be
with
the
old
squire
and
Kate
.
<EOS>
I
have
told
her
nothing
of
my
purpose
in
writing
this
letter
.
<EOS>
If
it
should
be
that
your
answer
is
such
as
I
desire
,
I
should
use
the
opportunity
of
our
re
-
engagement
to
endeavour
to
be
reconciled
to
my
grandfather
.
<EOS>
He
has
misunderstood
me
and
has
ill
-
used
me
.
<EOS>
But
I
am
ready
to
forgive
that
,
if
he
will
allow
me
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
In
such
case
you
and
Kate
would
arrange
that
,
and
I
would
,
if
possible
,
go
down
to
Vavasor
while
you
are
there
.
<EOS>
But
I
am
galloping
on
a
-
head
foolishly
in
thinking
of
this
,
and
am
counting
up
my
wealth
while
the
crockery
in
my
basket
is
so
very
fragile
.
<EOS>
One
word
from
you
will
decide
whether
or
no
I
shall
ever
bring
it
into
market
.
  
<EOS>
If
that
word
is
to
be
adverse
do
not
say
anything
of
a
meeting
between
me
and
the
Squire
.
<EOS>
Under
such
circumstances
it
would
be
impossible
.
<EOS>
But
,
oh
,
Alice
!
<EOS>
do
not
let
it
be
adverse
.
<EOS>
I
think
you
love
me
.
<EOS>
Your
woman
's
pride
towards
me
has
been
great
and
good
and
womanly
;
but
it
has
had
its
way
;
and
,
if
you
love
me
,
might
now
be
taught
to
succumb
.
  
<EOS>
Dear
Alice
,
will
you
be
my
wife
?
  
<EOS>
Yours
,
in
any
event
,
most
affectionately
,
  
GEORGE
VAVASOR
.
  
<EOS>
Vavasor
,
when
he
had
finished
his
letter
,
went
back
to
his
seat
over
the
fire
,
and
there
he
sat
with
it
close
at
his
hand
for
nearly
an
hour
.
<EOS>
Once
or
twice
he
took
it
up
with
fingers
almost
itching
to
throw
it
into
the
fire
.
<EOS>
He
took
it
up
and
held
the
corners
between
his
forefinger
and
thumb
,
throwing
forward
his
hand
towards
the
flame
,
as
though
willing
that
the
letter
should
escape
from
him
and
perish
if
chance
should
so
decide
.
<EOS>
But
chance
did
not
so
decide
,
and
the
letter
was
put
back
upon
the
table
at
his
elbow
.
<EOS>
Then
when
the
hour
was
nearly
over
he
read
it
again
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
bet
two
to
one
that
she
gives
way
,
"
he
said
to
himself
,
as
he
put
the
sheet
of
paper
back
into
the
envelope
.
"
<EOS>
Women
are
such
out
-
and
-
out
fools
.
<EOS>
"
Then
he
took
his
candle
,
and
carrying
his
letter
with
him
,
went
into
his
bedroom
.
  
<EOS>
The
next
morning
was
the
morning
of
Christmas
Eve
.
<EOS>
At
about
nine
o'clock
a
boy
came
into
his
room
who
was
accustomed
to
call
for
orders
for
the
day
.
<EOS>
"
Jem
,
"
he
said
to
the
boy
,
"
there
's
half
a
crown
lying
there
on
the
looking
-
glass
.
"
<EOS>
Jem
looked
and
acknowledged
the
presence
of
the
half
-
crown
.
"
<EOS>
Is
it
a
head
or
a
tail
,
Jem
?
"
<EOS>
asked
the
boy
's
master
.
<EOS>
Jem
scrutinized
the
coin
,
and
declared
that
the
uppermost
surface
showed
a
tail
.
"
<EOS>
Then
take
that
letter
and
post
it
,
"
said
George
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
Whereupon
Jem
,
asking
no
question
and
thinking
but
little
of
the
circumstances
under
which
the
command
was
given
,
did
take
the
letter
and
did
post
it
.
<EOS>
In
due
accordance
with
postal
regulations
it
reached
Vavasor
Hall
and
was
delivered
to
Alice
on
the
Christmas
morning
.
  
<EOS>
A
merry
<EOS>
Christmas
did
not
fall
to
the
lot
of
George
Vavasor
on
the
present
occasion
.
<EOS>
An
early
Christmas
-
box
he
did
receive
in
the
shape
of
a
very
hurried
note
from
his
friend
Burgo
.
<EOS>
"
This
will
be
brought
to
you
by
Stickling
,
"
the
note
said
;
but
who
Stickling
was
Vavasor
did
not
know
.
<EOS>
"
I
send
the
bill
.
<EOS>
Could
n't
you
get
the
money
and
send
it
me
,
as
I
do
n't
want
to
go
up
to
town
again
before
the
thing
comes
off
?
<EOS>
You
're
a
trump
;
and
will
do
the
best
you
can
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
let
that
rogue
off
for
less
than
a
hundred
and
twenty
.
 
<EOS>
Yours
,
B.
F.
"
Vavasor
,
therefore
,
having
nothing
better
to
do
,
spent
his
Christmas
morning
in
calling
on
Mr.
Magruin
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Mr.
Vavasor
,
"
said
Magruin
;
"
really
this
is
no
morning
for
business
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Time
and
tide
wait
for
no
man
,
Mr.
Magruin
,
and
my
friend
wants
his
money
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Mr.
Vavasor
,
 
to
-
morrow
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
If
time
and
tide
wo
n't
wait
,
neither
will
love
.
<EOS>
Come
,
Mr.
Magruin
,
out
with
your
cheque
-
book
,
and
do
n't
let
's
have
any
nonsense
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
is
the
lady
sure
,
Mr.
Vavasor
?
"
asked
Mr.
Magruin
,
anxiously
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ladies
never
are
sure
,
"
said
Vavasor
;
"
hardly
more
sure
than
bills
made
over
to
money
-
lenders
.
<EOS>
I
'm
not
going
to
wait
here
all
day
.
<EOS>
Are
you
going
to
give
him
the
money
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Christmas
-
day
,
Mr.
Vavasor
!
<EOS>
There
's
no
getting
money
in
the
city
to
-
day
.
"
  
<EOS>
But
Vavasor
before
he
left
did
get
the
money
from
Mr.
Magruin
,
 
£
122
10s
.
 
<EOS>
for
which
an
acceptance
at
two
months
for
£
500
was
given
in
exchange
,
 
and
carried
it
off
in
triumph
.
<EOS>
"
Do
tell
him
to
be
punctual
,
"
said
Mr.
Magruin
,
when
Vavasor
took
his
leave
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
so
like
young
men
to
be
punctual
.
<EOS>
But
I
really
think
Mr.
Fitzgerald
is
the
most
unpunctual
young
man
I
ever
did
know
yet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
he
is
,
"
said
George
Vavasor
,
as
he
went
away
.
  
<EOS>
He
ate
his
Christmas
dinner
in
absolute
solitude
at
an
eating
-
house
near
his
lodgings
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
supposed
that
no
man
dares
to
dine
at
his
club
on
a
Christmas
Day
.
<EOS>
He
at
any
rate
did
not
so
dare
;
 
and
after
dinner
he
wandered
about
through
the
streets
,
wondering
within
his
mind
how
he
would
endure
the
restraints
of
married
life
.
<EOS>
And
the
same
dull
monotony
of
his
days
was
continued
for
a
week
,
during
which
he
waited
,
not
impatiently
,
for
an
answer
to
his
letter
.
<EOS>
And
before
the
end
of
the
week
the
answer
came
.
   
<EOS>
Among
the
Fells
.
 
<EOS>
Alice
came
down
to
breakfast
on
that
Christmas
morning
at
Vavasor
Hall
without
making
any
sign
as
to
the
letter
she
had
received
.
<EOS>
The
party
there
consisted
of
her
grandfather
,
her
father
,
her
cousin
Kate
,
and
herself
.
<EOS>
They
all
made
their
Christmas
salutations
as
is
usual
,
and
Alice
received
and
made
hers
as
did
the
others
,
without
showing
that
anything
had
occurred
to
disturb
her
tranquillity
.
<EOS>
Kate
remarked
that
she
had
heard
that
morning
from
Aunt
Greenow
,
and
promised
to
show
Alice
the
letter
after
breakfast
.
<EOS>
But
Alice
said
no
word
of
her
own
letter
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
did
n't
your
aunt
come
here
to
eat
her
Christmas
dinner
?
"
said
the
Squire
.
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
,
sir
,
because
you
did
n't
ask
her
,
"
said
Kate
,
standing
close
to
her
grandfather
,
 
for
the
old
man
was
somewhat
deaf
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
why
did
n't
you
ask
her
;
 
that
is
,
if
she
stands
upon
asking
to
come
to
her
old
home
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nay
,
sir
,
but
I
could
n't
do
that
without
your
bidding
.
<EOS>
We
Vavasors
are
not
always
fond
of
meeting
each
other
.

Hold
your
tongue
,
Kate
.
<EOS>
I
know
what
you
mean
,
and
you
should
be
the
last
to
speak
of
it
.
<EOS>
Alice
,
my
dear
,
come
and
sit
next
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
am
much
obliged
to
you
for
coming
down
all
this
way
to
see
your
old
grandfather
at
Christmas
.
<EOS>
I
am
indeed
.
<EOS>
I
only
wish
you
had
brought
better
news
about
your
sweetheart
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
'll
think
better
of
it
before
long
,
sir
,
"
said
her
father
.
  
<EOS>
"
Papa
,
you
should
n't
say
that
.
<EOS>
You
would
not
wish
me
to
marry
against
my
own
judgement
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
much
about
ladies
"
judgements
,
"
said
the
old
man
.
<EOS>
"
It
does
seem
to
me
that
when
a
lady
makes
a
promise
she
ought
to
keep
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
According
to
that
,
"
said
Kate
,
"
if
I
were
engaged
to
a
man
,
and
found
that
he
was
a
murderer
,
I
still
ought
to
marry
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
Mr.
Grey
is
not
a
murderer
,
"
said
the
Squire
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pray
,
 
pray
,
do
n't
talk
about
it
,
"
said
Alice
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
do
I
really
can
not
sit
and
hear
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
given
over
saying
anything
on
the
subject
,
"
said
John
Vavasor
,
speaking
as
though
he
had
already
expended
upon
it
a
vast
amount
of
paternal
eloquence
.
<EOS>
He
had
,
however
,
never
said
more
than
has
been
recorded
in
these
pages
.
<EOS>
Alice
during
this
conversation
,
sat
with
her
cousin
's
letter
in
her
pocket
,
and
as
yet
had
not
even
begun
to
think
what
should
be
the
nature
of
her
reply
.
  
<EOS>
The
Squire
of
Vavasor
Hall
was
a
stout
old
man
,
with
a
red
face
and
grey
eyes
,
which
looked
fiercely
at
you
,
and
with
long
grey
hair
,
and
a
rough
grey
beard
,
which
gave
him
something
of
the
appearance
of
an
old
lion
.
<EOS>
He
was
passionate
,
unreasoning
,
and
specially
impatient
of
all
opposition
;
but
he
was
affectionate
,
prone
to
forgive
when
asked
to
do
so
,
unselfish
,
and
hospitable
.
<EOS>
He
was
,
moreover
,
guided
strictly
by
rules
,
which
he
believed
to
be
rules
of
right
.
<EOS>
His
grandson
George
had
offended
him
very
deeply
,
 
had
offended
him
and
never
asked
his
pardon
.
<EOS>
He
was
determined
that
such
pardon
should
never
be
given
,
unless
it
were
asked
for
with
almost
bended
knees
;
but
,
nevertheless
,
this
grandson
should
be
his
heir
.
<EOS>
That
was
his
present
intention
.
<EOS>
The
right
of
primogeniture
could
not
,
in
accordance
with
his
theory
,
be
abrogated
by
the
fact
that
it
was
,
in
George
Vavasor
's
case
,
protected
by
no
law
.
<EOS>
The
Squire
could
leave
Vavasor
Hall
to
whom
he
pleased
,
but
he
could
not
have
hoped
to
rest
quietly
in
his
grave
<EOS>
should
it
be
found
that
he
had
left
it
to
any
one
but
the
eldest
son
of
his
own
eldest
son
.
<EOS>
Though
violent
,
and
even
stern
,
he
was
more
prone
to
love
than
to
anger
;
and
though
none
of
those
around
him
dared
to
speak
to
him
of
his
grandson
,
yet
he
longed
in
his
heart
for
some
opportunity
of
being
reconciled
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
The
whole
party
went
to
church
on
this
Christmas
morning
.
<EOS>
The
small
parish
church
of
Vavasor
,
an
unpretending
wooden
structure
,
with
a
single
bell
which
might
be
heard
tinkling
for
a
mile
or
two
over
the
fells
,
stood
all
alone
about
half
a
mile
from
the
Squire
's
gate
.
<EOS>
Vavasor
was
a
parish
situated
on
the
intermediate
ground
between
the
mountains
of
the
lake
country
and
the
plains
.
<EOS>
Its
land
was
unproductive
,
ill
-
drained
,
and
poor
,
and
yet
it
possessed
little
or
none
of
the
beauty
which
tourists
go
to
see
.
<EOS>
It
was
all
amidst
the
fells
,
and
very
dreary
.
<EOS>
There
were
long
skirtings
of
dark
pines
around
a
portion
of
the
Squire
's
property
,
and
at
the
back
of
the
house
there
was
a
thick
wood
of
firs
running
up
to
the
top
of
what
was
there
called
the
Beacon
Hill
.
<EOS>
Through
this
there
was
a
wild
steep
walk
which
came
out
upon
the
moorland
,
and
from
thence
there
was
a
track
across
the
mountain
to
Hawes
Water
and
Naddale
,
and
on
over
many
miles
to
the
further
beauties
of
Bowness
and
Windermere
.
<EOS>
They
who
knew
the
country
,
and
whose
legs
were
of
use
to
them
,
could
find
some
of
the
grandest
scenery
in
England
within
reach
of
a
walk
from
Vavasor
Hall
;
but
to
others
the
place
was
very
desolate
.
<EOS>
For
myself
,
I
can
find
I
know
not
what
of
charm
in
wandering
over
open
,
unadorned
moorland
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
more
in
the
softness
of
the
grass
to
the
feet
,
and
the
freshness
of
the
air
to
the
lungs
,
than
in
anything
that
meets
the
eye
.
<EOS>
You
might
walk
for
miles
and
miles
to
the
north
-
east
,
or
east
,
or
south
-
east
of
Vavasor
without
meeting
any
object
to
arrest
the
view
.
<EOS>
The
great
road
from
Lancaster
to
Carlisle
crossed
the
outskirts
of
the
small
parish
about
a
mile
from
the
church
,
and
beyond
that
the
fell
seemed
to
be
interminable
.
<EOS>
Towards
the
north
it
rose
,
and
towards
the
south
it
fell
,
and
it
rose
and
fell
very
gradually
.
<EOS>
Here
and
there
some
slight
appearance
of
a
valley
might
be
traced
which
had
been
formed
by
the
action
of
the
waters
;
but
such
breakings
of
ground
were
inconsiderable
,
and
did
not
suffice
to
interrupt
the
stern
sameness
of
the
everlasting
moorland
.
  
<EOS>
The
daily
life
at
Vavasor
was
melancholy
enough
for
such
a
one
as
the
Squire
's
son
,
who
regarded
London
as
the
only
place
on
the
earth
's
surface
in
which
a
man
could
live
with
comfort
.
<EOS>
The
moors
offered
no
charms
to
him
.
<EOS>
Nor
did
he
much
appreciate
the
homely
comforts
of
the
Hall
;
for
the
house
,
though
warm
,
was
old
-
fashioned
and
small
,
and
the
Squire
's
cook
was
nearly
as
old
as
the
Squire
himself
.
<EOS>
John
Vavasor
's
visits
to
Vavasor
were
always
visits
of
duty
rather
than
of
pleasure
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
not
so
with
Alice
.
<EOS>
She
could
be
very
happy
there
with
Kate
;
for
,
like
herself
,
Kate
was
a
good
walker
and
loved
the
mountains
.
<EOS>
Their
regard
for
each
other
had
grown
and
become
strong
because
they
had
gone
together
o'er
river
and
moor
,
and
because
they
had
together
disregarded
those
impediments
of
mud
and
wet
which
frighten
so
many
girls
away
from
the
beauties
of
nature
.
  
<EOS>
On
this
Christmas
Day
they
all
went
to
church
,
the
Squire
being
accompanied
by
Alice
in
a
vehicle
which
in
Ireland
is
called
an
inside
jaunting
-
car
,
and
which
is
perhaps
the
most
uncomfortable
kind
of
vehicle
yet
invented
;
while
John
Vavasor
walked
with
his
niece
.
<EOS>
But
the
girls
had
arranged
that
immediately
after
church
they
would
start
for
a
walk
up
the
Beacon
Hill
,
across
the
fells
,
towards
Hawes
Water
.
<EOS>
They
always
dined
at
the
Hall
at
the
vexatious
hour
of
five
;
but
as
their
church
service
,
with
the
sacrament
included
,
would
be
completed
soon
after
twelve
,
and
as
lunch
was
a
meal
which
the
Squire
did
not
himself
attend
,
they
could
have
full
four
hours
for
their
excursion
.
<EOS>
This
had
all
been
planned
before
Alice
received
her
letter
;
but
there
was
nothing
in
that
to
make
her
change
her
mind
about
the
walk
.
  
<EOS>
"
Alice
,
my
dear
,
"
said
the
old
man
to
her
when
they
were
together
in
the
jaunting
-
car
,
"
you
ought
to
get
married
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
Squire
was
hard
of
hearing
,
and
under
any
circumstances
an
inside
jaunting
-
car
is
a
bad
place
for
conversation
,
as
your
teeth
are
nearly
shaken
out
of
your
head
by
every
movement
which
the
horse
makes
.
<EOS>
Alice
therefore
said
nothing
,
but
smiled
faintly
,
in
reply
to
her
grandfather
.
<EOS>
On
returning
from
church
he
insisted
that
Alice
should
again
accompany
him
,
telling
her
specially
that
he
desired
to
speak
to
her
.
"
<EOS>
My
dear
child
,
"
he
said
,
"
I
have
been
thinking
a
great
deal
about
you
,
and
you
ought
to
get
married
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
sir
,
perhaps
I
shall
some
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
if
you
quarrel
with
all
your
suitors
,
"
said
the
old
man
.
<EOS>
"
You
quarrelled
with
your
cousin
George
,
and
now
you
have
quarrelled
with
Mr.
Grey
.
<EOS>
You
'll
never
get
married
,
<EOS>
my
dear
,
if
you
go
on
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
should
I
be
married
more
than
Kate
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Oh
,
Kate
!
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
that
anybody
wants
to
marry
Kate
.
<EOS>
I
wish
you
'd
think
of
what
I
say
.
<EOS>
If
you
do
n't
get
married
before
long
,
perhaps
you
'll
never
get
married
at
all
.
<EOS>
Gentlemen
wo
n't
stand
that
kind
of
thing
for
ever
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
two
girls
took
a
slice
of
cake
each
in
her
hand
,
and
started
on
their
walk
.
<EOS>
"
We
sha
n't
be
able
to
get
to
the
lake
,
"
said
Kate
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Alice
;
"
<EOS>
but
we
can
go
as
far
as
the
big
stone
on
Swindale
Fell
,
where
we
can
sit
down
and
see
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
remember
the
last
time
we
sat
there
?
"
said
Kate
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
nearly
three
years
ago
,
and
it
was
then
that
you
told
me
that
all
was
to
be
over
between
you
and
George
.
<EOS>
Do
you
remember
what
a
fool
I
was
,
and
how
I
screamed
in
my
sorrow
?
<EOS>
I
sometimes
wonder
at
myself
and
my
own
folly
.
<EOS>
How
is
it
that
I
can
never
get
up
any
interest
about
my
own
belongings
?
<EOS>
And
then
we
got
soaking
wet
through
coming
home
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
remember
that
very
well
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
how
dark
it
was
!
<EOS>
That
was
in
September
,
but
we
had
dined
early
.
<EOS>
If
we
go
as
far
as
Swindale
we
shall
have
<EOS>
it
very
dark
coming
home
to
-
day
;
 
<EOS>
but
I
do
n't
mind
that
through
the
Beacon
Wood
,
because
I
know
my
way
so
well
.
<EOS>
You
wo
n't
be
afraid
of
half
an
hour
's
dark
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
no
,
"
said
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
I
do
remember
that
day
.
<EOS>
Well
;
it
's
all
for
the
best
,
I
suppose
.
<EOS>
And
now
I
must
read
you
my
aunt
's
letter
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Then
,
while
they
were
still
in
the
wood
,
Kate
took
out
the
letter
from
her
aunt
and
read
it
,
while
they
still
walked
slowly
up
the
hill
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
that
hitherto
neither
of
her
two
suitors
had
brought
the
widow
to
terms
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
she
continued
to
write
of
Mr.
Cheesacre
as
though
that
gentleman
were
inconsolable
for
the
loss
of
Kate
,
and
gave
her
niece
much
serious
advice
as
to
the
expedience
of
returning
to
Norfolk
,
in
order
that
she
might
secure
so
eligible
a
husband
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
understand
all
the
time
,
Alice
,
"
said
Kate
,
pausing
as
she
read
the
letter
,
"
that
the
dear
man
has
never
given
me
the
slightest
ground
for
the
faintest
hope
,
and
that
I
know
to
a
certainty
that
he
makes
an
offer
to
her
twice
a
week
,
 
<EOS>
that
is
,
on
every
market
day
.
<EOS>
You
ca
n't
enjoy
half
the
joke
if
you
wo
n't
bear
that
in
mind
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Alice
promised
that
she
would
bear
it
all
in
mind
,
and
then
Kate
went
on
with
her
reading
.
<EOS>
Poor
Bellfield
was
working
very
hard
at
his
drill
,
Mrs.
Greenow
went
on
to
say
;
so
hard
that
sometimes
she
really
thought
the
fatigue
would
be
too
much
for
his
strength
.
<EOS>
He
would
come
in
sometimes
of
an
evening
and
just
take
a
cup
of
tea
;
 
generally
on
Mondays
and
Thursdays
.
<EOS>
"
These
are
not
market
days
at
Norwich
,
"
said
Kate
;
"
and
thus
unpleasant
meetings
are
avoided
.
"
<EOS>
"
He
comes
in
,
"
said
Mrs.
Greenow
,
"
and
takes
a
little
tea
;
and
sometimes
I
think
that
he
will
faint
at
my
feet
.
"
<EOS>
"
That
he
kneels
there
on
every
occasion
,
"
said
Kate
,
"
and
repeats
his
offer
also
twice
a
week
,
I
have
not
the
least
doubt
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
will
she
accept
him
at
last
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Really
I
do
n't
know
what
to
think
of
it
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
I
fancy
that
she
likes
the
fun
of
the
thing
,
but
that
she
is
too
wide
-
awake
to
put
herself
in
any
man
's
power
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
doubt
she
lends
him
money
,
because
he
wants
it
sadly
and
she
is
very
generous
.
<EOS>
She
gives
him
money
,
I
feel
sure
,
but
takes
his
receipt
on
stamped
paper
for
every
shilling
.
<EOS>
That
's
her
character
all
over
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
letter
then
went
on
to
say
that
the
writer
had
made
up
her
mind
to
remain
at
Norwich
certainly
through
the
winter
and
spring
,
and
that
she
was
anxiously
desirous
that
her
dear
Kate
should
go
back
to
her
.
<EOS>
"
Come
and
have
one
other
look
at
Oileymead
,
"
said
the
letter
,
"
and
then
,
if
you
make
up
your
mind
that
you
do
n't
like
it
or
him
,
I
wo
n't
ask
you
to
think
of
them
ever
again
.
<EOS>
I
believe
him
to
be
a
very
honest
fellow
.
"
<EOS>
"
Did
you
ever
know
such
a
woman
?
"
said
Kate
;
"
with
all
her
faults
I
believe
she
would
go
through
fire
and
water
to
serve
me
.
<EOS>
I
think
she
'd
lend
me
money
without
any
stamped
paper
.
"
<EOS>
Then
Aunt
Greenow
's
letter
was
put
up
,
and
the
two
girls
had
come
out
upon
the
open
fell
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
delicious
afternoon
for
a
winter
's
walk
.
<EOS>
The
air
was
clear
and
cold
,
but
not
actually
frosty
.
<EOS>
The
ground
beneath
their
feet
was
dry
,
and
the
sky
,
though
not
bright
,
had
that
appearance
of
enduring
weather
which
gives
no
foreboding
of
rain
.
<EOS>
There
is
a
special
winter
's
light
,
which
is
very
clear
though
devoid
of
all
brilliancy
,
 
through
which
every
object
strikes
upon
the
eye
with
well
-
marked
lines
,
and
under
which
almost
all
forms
of
nature
seem
graceful
to
the
sight
if
not
actually
beautiful
.
<EOS>
But
there
is
a
certain
melancholy
which
ever
accompanies
it
.
<EOS>
It
is
the
light
of
the
afternoon
,
and
gives
token
of
the
speedy
coming
of
the
early
twilight
.
<EOS>
It
tells
of
the
shortness
of
the
day
,
and
contains
even
in
its
clearness
a
promise
of
the
gloom
of
night
.
<EOS>
It
is
absolute
light
,
but
it
seems
to
contain
the
darkness
which
is
to
follow
it
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
that
it
is
ever
to
be
seen
and
felt
so
plainly
as
on
the
wide
moorland
,
where
the
eye
stretches
away
over
miles
,
and
sees
at
the
world
's
end
the
faint
low
lines
of
distant
clouds
settling
themselves
upon
the
horizon
.
<EOS>
Such
was
the
light
of
this
Christmas
afternoon
,
and
both
the
girls
had
felt
the
effects
of
it
before
they
reached
the
big
stone
on
Swindale
Fell
,
from
which
they
intended
to
look
down
upon
the
loveliness
of
Hawes
Water
.
<EOS>
As
they
went
up
through
the
wood
there
had
been
some
laughter
between
them
over
Aunt
Greenow
's
letter
;
and
they
had
discussed
almost
with
mirth
the
merits
of
Oileymead
and
Mr.
Cheesacre
;
but
as
they
got
further
on
to
the
fell
,
and
as
the
half
-
melancholy
wildness
of
the
place
struck
them
,
their
words
became
less
light
,
and
after
a
while
they
almost
ceased
to
speak
.
  
<EOS>
Alice
had
still
her
letter
in
her
pocket
.
<EOS>
She
had
placed
it
there
when
she
came
down
to
breakfast
,
and
had
carried
it
with
her
since
.
<EOS>
She
had
come
to
no
resolution
as
yet
as
to
her
answer
to
it
,
nor
had
she
resolved
whether
or
no
she
would
show
it
to
Kate
.
<EOS>
Kate
had
ever
been
regarded
by
her
as
her
steadfast
friend
.
<EOS>
In
all
these
affairs
she
had
spoken
openly
to
Kate
.
<EOS>
We
know
that
Kate
had
in
part
betrayed
her
,
but
Alice
suspected
no
such
treason
.
<EOS>
She
had
often
quarrelled
with
Kate
;
but
she
had
quarrelled
with
her
not
on
account
of
any
sin
against
the
faith
of
their
friendship
.
<EOS>
She
believed
in
her
cousin
perfectly
,
though
she
found
herself
often
called
upon
to
disagree
with
her
almost
violently
.
<EOS>
Why
should
she
not
show
this
letter
to
Kate
,
and
discuss
it
in
all
its
bearings
before
she
replied
to
it
?
<EOS>
This
was
in
her
mind
as
she
walked
silently
along
over
the
fell
.
  
<EOS>
The
reader
will
surmise
from
this
that
she
was
already
half
inclined
to
give
way
,
and
to
join
her
lot
to
that
of
her
cousin
George
.
<EOS>
Alas
,
yes
!
<EOS>
The
reader
will
be
right
in
his
surmise
.
<EOS>
And
yet
it
was
not
her
love
for
the
man
that
prompted
her
to
run
so
terrible
a
risk
.
<EOS>
Had
it
been
so
<EOS>
,
I
think
that
it
would
be
easier
to
forgive
her
.
<EOS>
She
was
beginning
to
think
that
love
,
 
the
love
of
which
she
had
once
thought
so
much
,
 
did
not
matter
.
<EOS>
Of
what
use
was
it
,
and
to
what
had
it
led
?
<EOS>
What
had
love
done
for
her
friend
Glencora
?
<EOS>
What
had
love
done
for
her
?
<EOS>
Had
she
not
loved
John
Grey
,
and
had
she
not
felt
that
with
all
her
love
life
with
him
would
have
been
distasteful
to
her
?
<EOS>
It
would
have
been
impossible
for
her
to
marry
a
man
whom
personally
she
disliked
;
but
she
liked
her
cousin
George
,
 
well
enough
,
as
she
said
to
herself
almost
indifferently
.
  
<EOS>
Upon
the
whole
it
was
a
grievous
task
to
her
in
these
days
,
 
this
having
to
do
something
with
her
life
.
<EOS>
Was
it
not
all
vain
and
futile
?
<EOS>
As
for
that
girl
's
dream
of
the
joys
of
love
which
she
had
once
dreamed
,
 
that
had
gone
from
her
slumbers
,
never
to
return
.
<EOS>
How
might
she
best
make
herself
useful
,
 
useful
in
some
sort
that
might
gratify
her
ambition
;
 
that
was
now
the
question
which
seemed
to
her
to
be
of
most
importance
.
  
<EOS>
Her
cousin
's
letter
to
her
had
been
very
crafty
.
<EOS>
He
had
studied
the
whole
of
her
character
accurately
as
he
wrote
it
.
<EOS>
When
he
had
sat
down
to
write
it
<EOS>
he
had
been
indifferent
to
the
result
;
but
he
had
written
it
with
that
care
to
attain
success
which
a
man
uses
when
he
is
anxious
not
to
fail
in
an
attempt
.
<EOS>
Whether
or
no
he
cared
to
marry
his
cousin
was
a
point
so
little
interesting
to
him
that
chance
might
decide
it
for
him
;
but
when
chance
had
decided
that
he
did
wish
it
,
it
was
necessary
for
his
honour
that
he
should
have
that
for
which
he
condescended
to
ask
.
  
<EOS>
His
letter
to
her
had
been
clever
and
very
crafty
.
<EOS>
"
At
any
rate
he
does
me
justice
,
"
she
said
to
herself
,
when
she
read
those
words
about
her
money
,
and
the
use
which
he
proposed
to
make
of
it
.
"
<EOS>
He
is
welcome
to
it
all
if
it
will
help
him
in
his
career
,
whether
he
has
it
as
my
friend
or
as
my
husband
.
"
<EOS>
Then
she
thought
of
Kate
's
promise
of
her
little
mite
,
and
declared
to
herself
that
she
would
not
be
less
noble
than
her
cousin
Kate
.
<EOS>
And
would
it
not
be
well
that
she
should
be
the
means
of
reconciling
George
to
his
grandfather
?
<EOS>
George
was
the
representative
of
the
family
,
 
of
a
family
so
old
that
no
one
now
knew
which
had
first
taken
the
ancient
titular
name
of
some
old
Saxon
landowner
,
 
the
parish
,
or
the
man
.
<EOS>
There
had
been
in
old
days
some
worthy
Vavaseurs
,
as
Chaucer
calls
them
,
whose
rank
and
bearing
had
been
adopted
on
the
moorland
side
.
<EOS>
Of
these
things
Alice
thought
much
,
and
felt
that
it
should
be
her
duty
so
to
act
,
that
future
Vavasors
might
at
any
rate
not
be
less
in
the
world
than
they
who
had
passed
away
.
<EOS>
In
a
few
years
at
furthest
,
George
Vavasor
must
be
Vavasor
of
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
Would
it
not
be
right
that
she
should
help
him
to
make
that
position
honourable
?
  
<EOS>
They
walked
on
,
exchanging
now
and
again
a
word
or
two
,
till
the
distant
Cumberland
mountains
began
to
form
themselves
in
groups
of
beauty
before
their
eyes
.
<EOS>
"
There
's
Helvellyn
at
last
,
"
said
Kate
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
always
happy
when
I
see
that
.
"
<EOS>
"
And
is
n't
that
Kidsty
Pike
?
"
asked
Alice
.
"
<EOS>
No
;
you
do
n't
see
Kidsty
yet
.
<EOS>
But
you
will
when
you
get
up
to
the
bank
there
.
<EOS>
That
's
<EOS>
Scaw
Fell
on
the
left
;
 
the
round
distant
top
.
<EOS>
I
can
distinguish
it
,
though
I
doubt
whether
you
can
.
<EOS>
"
Then
they
went
on
again
,
and
were
soon
at
the
bank
from
whence
the
sharp
top
of
the
mountain
which
Alice
had
named
was
visible
.
"
<EOS>
And
now
we
are
on
Swindale
,
and
in
five
minutes
we
shall
get
to
the
stone
.
"
  
<EOS>
In
less
than
five
minutes
they
were
there
;
and
then
,
but
not
till
then
,
the
beauty
of
the
little
lake
,
lying
down
below
them
in
the
quiet
bosom
of
the
hills
,
disclosed
itself
.
<EOS>
A
lake
should
,
I
think
,
be
small
,
and
should
be
seen
from
above
,
to
be
seen
in
all
its
glory
.
<EOS>
The
distance
should
be
such
that
the
shadows
of
the
mountains
on
its
surface
may
just
be
traced
,
and
that
some
faint
idea
of
the
ripple
on
the
waters
may
be
present
to
the
eye
.
<EOS>
And
the
form
of
the
lakes
should
be
irregular
,
curving
round
from
its
base
among
the
lower
hills
,
deeper
and
still
deeper
into
some
close
nook
up
among
the
mountains
from
which
its
head
waters
spring
.
<EOS>
It
is
thus
that
a
lake
should
be
seen
,
and
it
was
thus
that
Hawes
Water
was
seen
by
them
from
the
flat
stone
on
the
side
of
Swindale
Fell
.
<EOS>
The
basin
of
the
lake
has
formed
itself
into
the
shape
of
the
figure
of
3
,
and
the
top
section
of
the
figure
lies
embosomed
among
the
very
wildest
of
the
Westmoreland
mountains
.
<EOS>
Altogether
it
is
not
above
three
miles
long
,
and
every
point
of
it
was
to
be
seen
from
the
spot
on
which
the
girls
sat
themselves
down
.
<EOS>
The
water
beneath
was
still
as
death
,
and
as
dark
,
 
and
looked
almost
as
cold
.
<EOS>
But
the
slow
clouds
were
passing
over
it
,
and
the
shades
of
darkness
on
its
surface
changed
themselves
with
gradual
changes
.
<EOS>
And
though
no
movement
was
visible
,
there
was
ever
and
again
in
places
a
slight
sheen
upon
the
lake
,
which
indicated
the
ripple
made
by
the
breeze
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
so
glad
I
've
come
here
,
"
said
Alice
,
seating
herself
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
bear
the
idea
of
coming
to
Vavasor
without
seeing
one
of
the
lakes
at
least
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
'll
get
over
to
Windermere
one
day
,
"
said
Kate
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
we
shall
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
think
it
possible
that
I
should
stay
long
.
<EOS>
Kate
,
I
've
got
a
letter
to
show
you
.
"
<EOS>
And
there
was
that
in
the
tone
of
her
voice
which
instantly
put
Kate
upon
her
mettle
.
  
<EOS>
Kate
seated
herself
also
,
and
put
up
her
hand
for
the
letter
.
"
<EOS>
Is
it
from
Mr.
Grey
?
<EOS>
"
she
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Alice
;
"
it
is
not
from
Mr.
Grey
.
<EOS>
"
And
she
gave
her
companion
the
paper
.
<EOS>
Kate
before
she
had
touched
it
had
seen
that
it
was
from
her
brother
George
;
and
as
she
opened
it
looked
anxiously
into
Alice
's
face
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Has
he
offended
you
?
"
<EOS>
Kate
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
Read
it
,
"
said
Alice
,
"
and
then
we
'll
talk
of
it
afterwards
,
 
as
we
go
home
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Then
she
got
up
from
the
stone
and
walked
a
step
or
two
towards
the
brow
of
the
fell
,
and
stood
there
looking
down
upon
the
lake
,
while
Kate
read
the
letter
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
when
she
returned
to
her
place
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
said
Kate
.
<EOS>
"
Alice
,
Alice
,
it
will
,
indeed
,
be
well
if
you
listen
to
him
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
Alice
,
may
I
hope
?
<EOS>
Alice
,
my
own
Alice
,
my
darling
,
my
friend
!
<EOS>
Say
that
it
shall
be
so
.
"
<EOS>
And
Kate
knelt
at
her
friend
's
feet
upon
the
heather
,
and
looked
up
into
her
face
with
eyes
full
of
tears
.
<EOS>
What
shall
we
say
of
a
woman
who
could
be
as
false
as
she
had
been
,
and
yet
could
be
so
true
?
  
<EOS>
Alice
made
no
immediate
answer
,
but
still
continued
to
gaze
down
over
her
friend
upon
the
lake
.
<EOS>
"
Alice
,
"
continued
Kate
,
"
I
did
not
think
I
should
be
made
so
happy
<EOS>
this
Christmas
Day
.
<EOS>
You
could
not
have
the
heart
to
bring
me
here
and
show
me
this
letter
in
this
way
,
and
bid
me
read
it
so
calmly
,
and
then
tell
me
that
it
is
all
for
nothing
.
<EOS>
No
;
you
could
not
do
that
?
<EOS>
Alice
,
I
am
so
happy
.
<EOS>
I
will
so
love
this
place
.
<EOS>
I
hated
it
before
.
"
<EOS>
And
then
she
put
her
face
down
upon
the
boulder
-
stone
and
kissed
it
.
<EOS>
Still
Alice
said
nothing
,
but
she
began
to
feel
that
she
had
gone
further
than
she
had
intended
.
<EOS>
It
was
almost
impossible
for
her
now
to
say
that
her
answer
to
George
must
be
a
refusal
.
  
<EOS>
Then
Kate
again
went
on
speaking
.
"
<EOS>
But
is
it
not
a
beautiful
letter
?
<EOS>
Say
,
Alice
,
 
is
it
not
a
letter
of
which
if
you
were
his
brother
you
would
feel
proud
if
another
girl
had
shown
it
to
you
?
<EOS>
I
do
feel
proud
of
him
.
<EOS>
I
know
that
he
is
a
man
with
a
manly
heart
and
manly
courage
,
who
will
yet
do
manly
things
.
<EOS>
Here
out
on
the
mountain
,
with
nobody
near
us
,
with
Nature
all
round
us
<EOS>
,
I
ask
you
on
your
solemn
word
as
a
woman
,
do
you
love
him
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Love
him
!
"
said
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
 
love
him
:
as
a
woman
should
love
her
husband
.
<EOS>
Is
not
your
heart
his
?
<EOS>
Alice
,
there
need
be
no
lies
now
.
<EOS>
If
it
be
so
,
it
should
be
your
glory
to
say
so
,
here
,
to
me
,
as
you
hold
that
letter
in
your
hand
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
have
no
such
glory
,
Kate
.
<EOS>
I
have
ever
loved
my
cousin
;
but
not
so
passionately
as
you
seem
to
think
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
there
can
be
no
passion
in
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
not
,
Kate
.
<EOS>
I
would
sometimes
hope
that
it
is
so
.
<EOS>
But
come
;
we
shall
be
late
;
and
you
will
be
cold
sitting
there
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
sit
here
all
night
to
be
sure
that
your
answer
would
be
as
I
would
have
it
.
<EOS>
But
,
Alice
,
at
any
rate
you
shall
tell
me
before
I
move
what
your
answer
is
to
be
.
<EOS>
I
know
you
will
not
refuse
him
;
but
make
me
happy
by
saying
so
with
your
own
lips
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
tell
you
before
you
move
,
Kate
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
why
not
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Because
I
have
not
as
yet
resolved
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
that
is
impossible
.
<EOS>
That
is
quite
impossible
.
<EOS>
On
such
a
subject
and
under
such
circumstances
a
woman
must
resolve
at
the
first
moment
.
<EOS>
You
had
resolved
,
I
know
,
before
you
had
half
read
the
letter
;
 
though
,
perhaps
,
it
may
not
suit
you
to
say
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
quite
mistaken
.
<EOS>
Come
along
and
let
us
walk
,
and
I
will
tell
you
all
.
"
<EOS>
Then
Kate
arose
,
and
they
turned
their
back
to
the
lake
,
and
began
to
make
their
way
homewards
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
made
up
my
mind
as
to
what
answer
I
will
give
him
;
but
I
have
shown
you
his
letter
in
order
that
I
might
have
some
one
with
whom
I
might
speak
openly
.
<EOS>
I
knew
well
how
it
would
be
,
and
that
you
would
strive
to
hurry
me
into
an
immediate
promise
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
 
no
<EOS>
;
I
want
nothing
of
the
kind
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
yet
I
could
not
deny
myself
the
comfort
of
your
friendship
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
Alice
,
I
will
not
hurry
you
.
<EOS>
I
will
do
nothing
that
you
do
not
wish
.
<EOS>
But
you
can
not
be
surprised
that
I
should
be
very
eager
.
<EOS>
Has
it
not
been
the
longing
of
all
my
life
?
<EOS>
Have
I
not
passed
my
time
plotting
and
planning
and
thinking
of
it
till
I
have
had
time
to
think
of
nothing
else
?
<EOS>
Do
you
know
what
I
suffered
when
,
through
George
's
fault
,
the
engagement
was
broken
off
?
<EOS>
Was
it
not
martyrdom
to
me
,
 
that
horrid
time
in
which
your
Crichton
from
Cambridgeshire
was
in
the
ascendant
?
<EOS>
Did
I
not
suffer
the
tortures
of
purgatory
while
that
went
on
;
 
and
yet
,
on
the
whole
,
did
I
not
bear
them
with
patience
?
<EOS>
And
,
now
,
can
you
be
surprised
that
I
am
wild
with
joy
when
I
begin
to
see
that
everything
will
be
as
I
wish
;
 
<EOS>
for
it
will
be
as
I
wish
,
Alice
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
that
you
have
not
resolved
to
accept
him
.
<EOS>
But
you
would
have
resolved
to
refuse
him
instantly
had
<EOS>
that
been
your
destined
answer
to
his
letter
.
<EOS>
"
There
was
but
little
more
said
between
them
on
the
subject
as
they
were
passing
over
the
fell
,
but
when
they
were
going
down
the
path
through
the
Beacon
Wood
,
Kate
again
spoke
:
"
You
will
not
answer
him
without
speaking
to
me
first
?
"
said
Kate
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
,
at
any
rate
,
not
send
my
answer
without
telling
you
,
"
said
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
will
let
me
see
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
"
said
Alice
;
"
I
will
not
promise
that
.
<EOS>
But
if
it
is
unfavourable
I
will
show
it
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
I
shall
never
see
it
,
"
said
Kate
,
laughing
.
<EOS>
"
But
that
is
quite
enough
for
me
.
<EOS>
I
by
no
means
wish
to
criticise
the
love
-
sweet
words
in
which
you
tell
him
that
his
offences
are
all
forgiven
.
<EOS>
I
know
how
sweet
they
will
be
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
heavens
!
<EOS>
how
I
envy
him
!
"
  
<EOS>
Then
they
were
at
home
;
and
the
old
man
met
them
at
the
front
door
,
glowering
at
them
angrily
from
out
his
old
leonine
eyes
,
because
the
roast
beef
was
already
roasted
.
<EOS>
He
had
his
great
uncouth
silver
watch
in
his
hand
,
which
was
always
a
quarter
of
an
hour
too
fast
,
and
he
pointed
at
it
fiercely
,
showing
them
the
minute
hand
at
ten
minutes
past
the
hour
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
grandpapa
,
you
are
always
too
fast
,
"
said
Kate
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
are
always
too
slow
,
miss
,
"
said
the
hungry
old
squire
.
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
,
it
is
not
five
yet
.
<EOS>
Is
it
,
Alice
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
how
long
are
you
going
to
be
dressing
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Not
ten
minutes
;
 
are
we
,
Alice
?
<EOS>
And
,
grandpapa
,
pray
do
n't
wait
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
wait
!
<EOS>
That
's
what
they
always
say
,
"
he
muttered
,
peevishly
.
"
<EOS>
As
if
one
would
be
any
better
waiting
for
them
after
the
meat
is
on
the
table
.
<EOS>
"
But
neither
Kate
nor
Alice
heard
this
,
as
they
were
already
in
their
rooms
.
  
<EOS>
Nothing
more
was
said
that
evening
between
Alice
and
Kate
about
the
letter
;
but
Kate
,
as
she
wished
her
cousin
good
night
inside
her
bedroom
door
,
spoke
to
her
just
one
word
 
<EOS>
"
Pray
for
him
to
-
night
,
"
she
said
,
"
as
you
pray
for
those
you
love
best
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Alice
made
no
answer
,
but
we
may
believe
that
she
did
as
she
was
desired
to
do
.
   
<EOS>
Containing
an
Answer
to
the
Love
Letter
.
 
<EOS>
Alice
had
had
a
week
allowed
to
her
to
write
her
answer
;
but
she
sent
it
off
before
the
full
week
was
past
.
<EOS>
"
Why
should
I
keep
him
in
suspense
?
"
<EOS>
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
If
it
is
to
be
so
,
there
can
be
no
good
in
not
saying
so
at
once
.
"
<EOS>
Then
she
thought
,
also
,
that
if
this
were
to
be
her
destiny
it
might
be
well
for
Mr.
Grey
that
all
his
doubts
on
the
matter
should
be
dispelled
.
<EOS>
She
had
treated
him
badly
,
 
very
badly
.
<EOS>
She
had
so
injured
him
that
the
remembrance
of
the
injury
must
always
be
a
source
of
misery
to
her
;
but
she
owed
to
him
above
everything
to
let
him
know
what
were
her
intentions
as
soon
as
they
were
settled
.
<EOS>
She
tried
to
console
herself
by
thinking
that
the
wound
to
him
would
be
easy
to
cure
.
"
<EOS>
He
also
is
not
passionate
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
But
in
so
saying
she
deceived
herself
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
man
in
whom
Love
could
be
very
passionate
;
 
and
was
,
moreover
,
one
in
whom
Love
could
hardly
be
renewed
.
  
<EOS>
Each
morning
Kate
asked
her
whether
her
answer
was
written
;
and
on
the
third
day
after
Christmas
,
just
before
dinner
,
Alice
said
that
she
had
written
it
,
and
that
it
was
gone
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
it
is
n't
post
-
day
,
"
said
Kate
;
 
for
the
post
illuminated
Vavasor
but
three
days
a
week
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
given
a
boy
sixpence
to
take
it
to
Shap
,
"
said
Alice
,
blushing
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
have
you
said
?
<EOS>
"
asked
Kate
,
taking
hold
of
the
other
's
arm
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
kept
my
promise
,
"
said
Alice
;
"
and
do
you
keep
yours
by
asking
no
further
questions
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
sister
,
 
my
own
sister
,
"
said
Kate
.
<EOS>
And
then
,
as
Alice
met
her
embrace
,
there
was
no
longer
any
doubt
as
to
the
nature
of
the
reply
.
  
<EOS>
After
this
there
was
of
course
much
close
discussion
between
them
as
to
what
other
steps
should
now
be
taken
.
<EOS>
Kate
wanted
her
cousin
to
write
immediately
to
Mr.
Grey
,
and
was
somewhat
frightened
when
Alice
declined
to
do
so
till
she
had
received
a
further
letter
from
George
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
not
proposed
any
horrid
stipulations
to
him
?
"
exclaimed
Kate
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
what
you
may
call
horrid
stipulations
,
"
said
Alice
,
gravely
.
<EOS>
"
My
conditions
have
not
been
very
hard
,
and
I
do
not
think
you
would
have
disapproved
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
But
he
!
 
<EOS>
He
is
so
impetuous
!
<EOS>
Will
he
disapprove
them
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
told
him
 
<EOS>
But
,
Kate
,
this
is
just
what
I
did
not
mean
to
tell
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
should
there
be
secrets
between
us
?
"
said
Kate
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
shall
be
none
,
then
.
<EOS>
I
have
told
him
that
I
can
not
bring
myself
to
marry
him
instantly
;
 
that
he
must
allow
me
twelve
months
to
wear
off
,
if
I
can
in
that
time
,
much
of
sadness
and
of
self
-
reproach
which
has
fallen
to
my
lot
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Twelve
months
,
Alice
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Listen
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
said
so
.
<EOS>
But
I
have
told
him
also
that
if
he
wishes
it
still
,
I
will
at
once
tell
papa
and
grandpapa
that
I
hold
myself
as
engaged
to
him
,
so
that
he
may
know
that
I
bind
myself
to
him
as
far
as
it
is
possible
that
I
should
do
so
.
<EOS>
And
I
have
added
something
else
,
Kate
,
"
she
continued
to
say
after
a
slight
pause
,
 
"
something
else
which
I
can
tell
you
,
though
I
could
tell
it
to
no
other
person
.
<EOS>
I
can
tell
you
because
you
would
do
,
and
will
do
the
same
.
<EOS>
I
have
told
him
that
any
portion
of
my
money
is
at
his
service
which
may
be
needed
for
his
purposes
before
that
twelve
months
is
over
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Alice
!
<EOS>
No
;
 
no
.
<EOS>
You
shall
not
do
that
.
<EOS>
It
is
too
generous
.
"
<EOS>
And
Kate
perhaps
felt
at
the
moment
that
her
brother
was
a
man
to
whom
such
an
offer
could
hardly
be
made
with
safety
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
have
done
it
.
<EOS>
Mercury
,
with
sixpence
in
his
pocket
,
is
already
posting
my
generosity
at
Shap
.
<EOS>
And
,
to
tell
the
truth
,
Kate
,
it
is
no
more
than
fair
.
<EOS>
He
has
honestly
told
me
that
while
the
old
Squire
lives
he
will
want
my
money
to
assist
him
in
a
career
of
which
I
do
much
more
than
approve
.
<EOS>
It
has
been
my
earnest
wish
to
see
him
in
Parliament
.
<EOS>
It
will
now
be
the
most
earnest
desire
of
my
heart
;
 
the
one
thing
as
to
which
I
shall
feel
an
intense
anxiety
.
<EOS>
How
then
can
I
have
the
face
to
bid
him
<EOS>
wait
twelve
months
for
that
which
is
specially
needed
in
six
months
"
time
?
<EOS>
It
would
be
like
the
workhouses
which
are
so
long
in
giving
bread
,
that
in
the
mean
time
the
wretches
starve
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
the
wretch
sha
n't
starve
,
"
said
Kate
.
<EOS>
"
My
money
,
small
as
it
is
,
will
carry
him
over
this
bout
.
<EOS>
I
have
told
him
that
he
shall
have
it
,
and
that
I
expect
him
to
spend
it
.
<EOS>
Moreover
,
I
have
no
doubt
that
Aunt
Greenow
would
lend
me
what
he
wants
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
should
not
wish
him
to
borrow
from
Aunt
Greenow
.
<EOS>
She
would
advance
him
the
money
,
as
you
say
,
upon
stamped
paper
,
and
then
talk
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
shall
have
mine
,
"
said
Kate
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
who
are
you
?
"
said
Alice
,
laughing
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
not
going
to
be
his
wife
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
shall
not
touch
your
money
till
you
are
his
wife
,
"
said
Kate
,
very
seriously
.
<EOS>
"
I
wish
you
would
consent
to
change
your
mind
about
this
stupid
tedious
year
,
and
then
you
might
do
as
you
pleased
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
doubt
such
a
settlement
might
be
made
as
to
the
property
here
,
when
my
grandfather
hears
of
it
,
as
would
make
you
ultimately
safe
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
do
you
think
I
care
to
be
ultimately
safe
,
as
you
call
it
?
<EOS>
Kate
,
my
dear
,
you
do
not
understand
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
not
.
<EOS>
And
yet
I
thought
that
I
had
known
something
about
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
because
I
do
not
care
for
the
safety
of
which
you
speak
that
I
am
now
going
to
become
your
brother
's
wife
.
<EOS>
Do
you
suppose
that
I
do
not
see
that
I
must
run
much
risk
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
prefer
the
excitement
of
London
to
the
tranquillity
,
may
I
say
,
of
Cambridgeshire
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
Exactly
;
 
and
therefore
I
have
told
George
that
he
shall
have
my
money
whenever
he
wants
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Kate
was
very
persistent
in
her
objection
to
this
scheme
till
George
's
answer
came
.
<EOS>
His
answer
to
Alice
was
accompanied
by
a
letter
to
his
sister
,
and
after
that
Kate
said
nothing
more
about
the
money
question
.
<EOS>
She
said
no
more
then
;
but
it
must
not
therefore
be
supposed
that
she
was
less
determined
than
she
had
been
that
no
part
of
Alice
's
fortune
should
be
sacrificed
to
her
brother
's
wants
;
 
at
any
rate
before
Alice
should
become
her
brother
's
wife
.
<EOS>
But
her
brother
's
letter
for
the
moment
stopped
her
mouth
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
necessary
that
she
should
speak
to
him
before
she
again
spoke
to
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
In
what
words
Alice
had
written
her
assent
it
will
be
necessary
that
the
reader
should
know
,
in
order
that
something
may
be
understood
of
the
struggle
which
she
made
upon
the
occasion
;
but
they
shall
be
given
presently
,
when
I
come
to
speak
of
George
Vavasor
's
position
as
he
received
them
.
<EOS>
George
's
reply
was
very
short
and
apparently
very
frank
.
<EOS>
He
deprecated
the
delay
of
twelve
months
,
and
still
hoped
to
be
able
to
induce
her
to
be
more
lenient
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
advised
her
to
write
to
Mr.
Grey
at
once
,
 
and
as
regarded
the
Squire
he
gave
her
_
carte
<EOS>
blanche
_
to
act
as
she
pleased
.
<EOS>
If
the
Squire
required
any
kind
of
apology
,
expression
of
sorrow
,
 
and
asking
for
pardon
,
or
such
like
,
he
,
George
,
would
,
under
the
circumstances
as
they
now
existed
,
comply
with
the
requisition
most
willingly
.
<EOS>
He
would
regard
it
as
a
simple
form
,
made
necessary
by
his
coming
marriage
.
<EOS>
As
to
Alice
's
money
,
he
thanked
her
heartily
for
her
confidence
.
<EOS>
If
the
nature
of
his
coming
contest
at
Chelsea
should
make
it
necessary
,
he
would
use
her
offer
as
frankly
as
it
had
been
made
.
<EOS>
Such
was
his
letter
to
Alice
.
<EOS>
What
was
contained
in
his
letter
to
Kate
,
Alice
never
knew
.
  
<EOS>
Then
came
the
business
of
telling
this
new
love
tale
,
 
<EOS>
the
third
which
poor
Alice
had
been
forced
to
tell
her
father
and
grandfather
;
 
and
a
grievous
task
it
was
.
<EOS>
In
this
matter
she
feared
her
father
much
more
than
her
grandfather
,
and
therefore
she
resolved
to
tell
her
grandfather
first
;
 
or
,
rather
,
she
determined
that
she
would
tell
the
Squire
,
and
that
in
the
mean
time
Kate
should
talk
to
her
father
.
  
<EOS>
"
Grandpapa
,
"
she
said
to
him
the
morning
after
she
had
received
her
cousin
's
second
letter
.
 
<EOS>
The
old
man
was
in
the
habit
of
breakfasting
alone
in
a
closet
of
his
own
,
which
was
called
his
dressing
-
room
,
but
in
which
he
kept
no
appurtenances
for
dressing
,
but
in
lieu
of
them
a
large
collection
of
old
spuds
and
sticks
and
horse's
-
bits
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
broken
spade
here
,
and
a
hoe
or
two
;
and
a
small
table
in
the
corner
was
covered
with
the
debris
of
tradesmen
's
bills
from
Penrith
,
and
dirty
scraps
which
he
was
wo
nt
to
call
his
farm
accounts
.
 
<EOS>
"
Grandpapa
,
"
said
Alice
,
rushing
away
at
once
into
the
middle
of
her
subject
,
"
you
told
me
the
other
day
that
you
thought
I
ought
to
be
 
married
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
I
,
my
dear
?
<EOS>
Well
,
yes
;
so
I
did
.
<EOS>
And
so
you
ought
;
 
I
mean
to
that
Mr.
Grey
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
impossible
,
sir
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
what
's
the
use
of
your
coming
and
talking
to
me
about
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
This
made
Alice
's
task
not
very
easy
;
but
,
nevertheless
,
she
persevered
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
come
,
grandpapa
,
to
tell
you
of
another
engagement
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Another
!
"
said
he
.
<EOS>
And
by
the
tone
of
his
voice
he
accused
his
granddaughter
of
having
a
larger
number
of
favoured
suitors
than
ought
to
fall
to
the
lot
of
any
young
lady
.
<EOS>
It
was
very
hard
upon
her
,
but
still
she
went
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
,
"
said
she
,
"
that
some
years
ago
I
was
to
have
been
married
to
my
cousin
George
;
"
 
and
then
she
paused
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
said
the
old
man
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
remember
you
told
me
then
that
you
were
much
pleased
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
So
I
was
.
<EOS>
George
was
doing
well
then
;
or
,
 
which
is
more
likely
,
 
had
made
us
believe
that
he
was
doing
well
.
<EOS>
Have
you
made
it
up
with
him
again
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
that
's
the
meaning
of
your
jilting
Mr.
Grey
,
is
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
Poor
Alice
!
<EOS>
It
is
hard
to
explain
how
heavy
a
blow
fell
upon
her
from
the
open
utterance
of
that
word
!
<EOS>
Of
all
words
in
the
language
it
was
the
one
which
she
now
most
dreaded
.
<EOS>
She
had
called
herself
a
jilt
,
with
that
inaudible
voice
which
one
uses
in
making
self
-
accusations
;
 
but
hitherto
no
lips
had
pronounced
the
odious
word
to
her
ears
.
<EOS>
Poor
Alice
!
<EOS>
She
was
a
jilt
;
and
perhaps
it
may
have
been
well
that
the
old
man
should
tell
her
so
.
  
<EOS>
"
Grandpapa
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
;
and
there
was
that
in
the
tone
of
her
voice
which
somewhat
softened
the
Squire
's
heart
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
my
dear
,
I
do
n't
want
to
be
ill
-
natured
.
<EOS>
So
you
are
going
at
last
to
marry
George
,
are
you
?
<EOS>
I
hope
he
'll
treat
you
well
;
that
's
all
.
<EOS>
Does
your
father
approve
of
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
told
you
first
,
sir
;
 
because
I
wish
to
obtain
your
consent
to
seeing
George
again
here
as
your
grandson
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Never
,
"
said
the
old
man
,
snarling
;
 
"
never
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
he
has
been
wrong
,
he
will
beg
your
pardon
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
he
has
been
wrong
!
<EOS>
Did
n't
he
want
to
squander
every
shilling
of
the
property
,
 
property
which
has
never
belonged
to
him
;
 
property
which
I
could
give
to
Tom
,
Dick
,
or
Harry
to
-
morrow
,
if
I
liked
?
 
<EOS>
If
he
has
been
wrong
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
defending
him
,
sir
;
 
but
I
thought
that
,
perhaps
,
on
such
an
occasion
as
this
 
"
  
"
A
Tom
Fool
's
occasion
!
<EOS>
You
've
got
money
of
your
own
.
<EOS>
He
'll
spend
all
that
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
He
will
be
less
likely
to
do
so
if
you
will
recognise
him
as
your
heir
.
<EOS>
Pray
believe
,
sir
,
that
he
is
not
the
sort
of
man
that
he
was
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
must
be
a
very
clever
sort
of
man
,
I
think
,
when
he
has
talked
you
out
of
such
a
husband
as
John
Grey
.
<EOS>
It
's
astounding
to
me
,
 
with
that
ugly
mug
of
his
!
<EOS>
Well
,
my
dear
,
if
your
father
approves
of
it
,
and
if
George
will
ask
my
pardon
,
 
but
<EOS>
I
do
n't
think
he
ever
will
 
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
will
,
sir
.
<EOS>
I
am
his
messenger
for
as
much
as
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
you
are
,
are
you
?
<EOS>
Then
you
may
also
be
my
messenger
to
him
,
and
tell
him
that
,
for
your
sake
,
I
will
let
him
come
back
here
.
<EOS>
I
know
he
'll
insult
me
the
first
day
;
but
I
'll
try
and
put
up
with
it
,
 
for
your
sake
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
Of
course
I
must
know
what
your
father
thinks
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
may
be
imagined
that
Kate
's
success
was
even
less
than
that
which
Alice
achieved
.
<EOS>
"
I
knew
it
would
be
so
,
"
said
John
Vavasor
,
when
his
niece
first
told
him
;
 
<EOS>
and
as
he
spoke
he
struck
his
hand
upon
the
table
.
<EOS>
"
I
knew
all
along
how
it
would
be
.
"
  
"
And
why
should
it
not
be
so
,
Uncle
John
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
your
brother
,
and
I
will
not
tell
you
why
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
think
that
he
is
a
spendthrift
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
that
he
is
as
unsafe
a
man
as
ever
<EOS>
I
knew
to
be
intrusted
with
the
happiness
of
any
young
woman
.
<EOS>
That
is
all
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
hard
upon
him
,
uncle
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
so
.
<EOS>
Tell
Alice
this
from
me
,
 
that
as
I
have
never
yet
been
able
to
get
her
to
think
anything
of
my
opinion
,
I
do
not
at
all
expect
that
I
shall
be
able
to
induce
her
to
do
so
now
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
even
make
the
attempt
.
<EOS>
As
my
son
-
in
-
law
I
will
not
receive
George
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
Tell
Alice
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
Alice
was
told
her
father
's
message
;
but
Kate
in
telling
it
felt
no
deep
regret
.
<EOS>
She
well
knew
that
Alice
would
not
be
turned
back
from
her
present
intention
by
her
father
's
wishes
.
<EOS>
Nor
would
it
have
been
very
reasonable
that
she
should
.
<EOS>
Her
father
had
for
many
years
relieved
himself
from
the
burden
of
a
father
's
cares
,
and
now
had
hardly
the
right
to
claim
a
father
's
privileges
.
  
<EOS>
We
will
now
go
once
again
to
George
Vavasor
's
room
in
Cecil
Street
,
in
which
he
received
Alice
's
letter
.
<EOS>
He
was
dressing
when
it
was
first
brought
to
him
;
and
when
he
recognised
the
handwriting
he
put
it
down
on
his
toilet
table
unopened
.
<EOS>
He
put
it
down
,
and
went
on
brushing
his
hair
,
as
though
he
were
determined
to
prove
to
himself
that
he
was
indifferent
as
to
the
tidings
which
it
might
contain
.
<EOS>
He
went
on
brushing
his
hair
,
and
cleaning
his
teeth
,
and
tying
his
cravat
carefully
over
his
turned
-
down
collar
,
while
the
unopened
letter
lay
close
to
his
hand
.
<EOS>
Of
course
he
was
thinking
of
it
,
 
<EOS>
of
course
he
was
anxious
,
 
<EOS>
of
course
his
eye
went
to
it
from
moment
to
moment
.
<EOS>
But
he
carried
it
with
him
into
the
sitting
-
room
still
unopened
,
and
so
it
remained
until
after
the
girl
had
brought
him
his
tea
and
his
toast
.
<EOS>
"
And
now
,
"
said
he
,
as
he
threw
himself
into
his
arm
-
chair
,
"
let
us
see
what
the
girl
of
my
heart
says
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
The
girl
of
his
heart
said
to
him
as
follows
:
    
MY
DEAR
GEORGE
,
  
<EOS>
I
feel
great
difficulty
in
answering
your
letter
.
<EOS>
Could
I
have
my
own
way
,
I
should
make
no
answer
to
it
at
present
,
but
leave
it
for
the
next
six
months
,
so
that
then
such
answer
might
hereafter
be
made
as
circumstances
should
seem
to
require
.
<EOS>
This
will
be
little
flattering
to
you
,
but
it
is
less
flattering
to
myself
.
<EOS>
Whatever
answer
I
may
make
,
how
can
anything
in
this
affair
be
flattering
either
to
you
or
to
me
?
<EOS>
We
have
been
like
children
who
have
quarrelled
over
our
game
of
play
,
till
now
,
at
the
close
of
our
little
day
of
pleasure
,
we
are
fain
to
meet
each
other
in
tears
,
and
acknowledge
that
we
have
looked
for
delights
where
no
delights
were
to
be
found
.
  
<EOS>
Kate
,
who
is
here
,
talks
to
me
of
passionate
love
.
<EOS>
There
is
no
such
passion
left
to
me
;
 
nor
,
as
I
think
,
to
you
either
.
<EOS>
It
would
not
now
be
possible
that
you
and
I
should
come
together
on
such
terms
as
that
.
<EOS>
We
could
not
stand
up
together
as
man
and
wife
with
any
hope
of
a
happy
marriage
,
unless
we
had
both
agreed
that
such
happiness
might
be
had
without
passionate
love
.
  
<EOS>
You
will
see
from
all
this
that
I
do
not
refuse
your
offer
.
<EOS>
Without
passion
,
I
have
for
you
a
warm
affection
,
which
enables
me
to
take
a
livelier
interest
in
your
career
than
in
any
other
of
the
matters
which
are
around
me
.
<EOS>
Of
course
,
if
I
become
your
wife
that
interest
will
be
still
closer
and
dearer
,
and
I
do
feel
that
I
can
take
in
it
that
concern
which
a
wife
should
have
in
her
husband
's
affairs
.
  
<EOS>
If
it
suits
you
,
I
will
become
your
wife
;
 
but
it
can
not
be
quite
at
once
.
<EOS>
I
have
suffered
much
from
the
past
conflicts
of
my
life
,
and
there
has
been
very
much
with
which
I
must
reproach
myself
.
<EOS>
I
know
that
I
have
behaved
badly
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
I
have
to
undergo
the
doubly
bitter
self
-
accusation
of
having
behaved
in
a
manner
which
the
world
will
call
unfeminine
.
<EOS>
You
must
understand
that
I
have
not
passed
through
this
unscathed
,
and
I
must
beg
you
to
allow
me
some
time
for
a
cure
.
<EOS>
A
perfect
cure
<EOS>
I
may
never
expect
,
but
I
think
that
in
twelve
months
from
this
time
I
may
so
far
have
recovered
my
usual
spirit
and
ease
of
mind
as
to
enable
me
to
devote
myself
to
your
happiness
.
<EOS>
Dear
George
,
if
you
will
accept
me
under
such
circumstances
,
I
will
be
your
wife
,
and
will
endeavour
to
do
my
duty
by
you
faithfully
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
said
that
even
now
,
as
your
cousin
,
I
take
a
lively
interest
in
your
career
,
 
of
course
<EOS>
I
mean
your
career
as
a
politician
,
 
and
especially
in
your
hopes
of
entering
Parliament
.
<EOS>
I
understand
,
accurately
as
I
think
,
what
you
have
said
about
my
fortune
,
and
I
perfectly
appreciate
your
truth
and
frankness
.
<EOS>
If
I
had
nothing
of
my
own
you
,
in
your
circumstances
,
could
not
possibly
take
me
as
your
wife
.
<EOS>
I
know
,
moreover
,
that
your
need
of
assistance
from
my
means
is
immediate
rather
than
prospective
.
<EOS>
My
money
may
be
absolutely
necessary
to
you
within
this
year
,
during
which
,
as
I
tell
you
most
truly
,
I
can
not
bring
myself
to
become
a
married
woman
.
<EOS>
But
my
money
shall
be
less
cross
-
grained
than
myself
.
<EOS>
You
will
take
it
as
frankly
as
I
mean
it
when
I
say
,
that
whatever
you
want
for
your
political
purposes
shall
be
forthcoming
at
your
slightest
wish
.
<EOS>
Dear
George
,
let
me
have
the
honour
and
glory
of
marrying
a
man
who
has
gained
a
seat
in
the
Parliament
of
Great
Britain
!
<EOS>
Of
all
positions
which
a
man
may
attain
that
,
to
me
,
is
the
grandest
.
  
<EOS>
I
shall
wait
for
a
further
letter
from
you
before
I
speak
either
to
my
father
or
to
my
grandfather
.
<EOS>
If
you
can
tell
me
that
you
accede
to
my
views
,
I
will
at
once
try
to
bring
about
a
reconciliation
between
you
and
the
Squire
.
<EOS>
I
think
that
that
will
be
almost
easier
than
inducing
my
father
to
look
with
favour
upon
our
marriage
.
<EOS>
But
I
need
hardly
say
that
should
either
one
or
the
other
oppose
it
,
 
or
should
both
do
so
,
 
that
would
not
turn
me
from
my
purpose
.
  
<EOS>
I
also
wait
for
your
answer
to
write
a
last
line
to
Mr.
Grey
.
  
<EOS>
Your
affectionate
cousin
,
  
ALICE
VAVASOR
.
  
<EOS>
George
Vavasor
when
he
had
read
the
letter
threw
it
carelessly
from
him
on
to
the
breakfast
table
,
and
began
to
munch
his
toast
.
<EOS>
He
threw
it
carelessly
from
him
,
as
though
taking
a
certain
pride
in
his
carelessness
.
"
<EOS>
Very
well
,
"
said
he
;
"
so
be
it
.
<EOS>
It
is
probably
the
best
thing
that
I
could
do
,
whatever
the
effect
may
be
on
her
.
"
<EOS>
Then
he
took
up
his
newspaper
.
<EOS>
But
before
the
day
was
over
he
had
made
many
plans
,
 
plans
made
almost
unconsciously
,
 
as
to
the
benefit
which
might
accrue
to
him
from
the
offer
which
she
had
made
of
her
money
.
<EOS>
And
before
night
he
had
written
that
reply
to
her
of
which
we
have
heard
the
contents
;
and
had
written
also
to
his
sister
Kate
a
letter
,
of
which
Kate
had
kept
the
contents
to
herself
.
   
<EOS>
Monkshade
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
first
of
the
new
year
came
round
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
was
not
keeping
her
appointment
at
Lady
Monk
's
house
.
<EOS>
She
went
to
Gatherum
Castle
,
and
let
us
hope
that
she
enjoyed
the
magnificent
Christmas
hospitality
of
the
Duke
;
but
when
the
time
came
for
moving
on
to
Monkshade
,
she
was
indisposed
,
and
Mr.
Palliser
went
thither
alone
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
returned
to
Matching
and
remained
at
home
,
while
her
husband
was
away
,
in
company
with
the
two
Miss
Pallisers
.
  
<EOS>
When
the
tidings
reached
Monkshade
that
Lady
Glencora
was
not
to
be
expected
,
Burgo
Fitzgerald
was
already
there
,
armed
with
such
pecuniary
assistance
as
George
Vavasor
had
been
able
to
wrench
out
of
the
hands
of
Mr.
Magruin
.
<EOS>
"
Burgo
,
"
said
his
aunt
,
catching
him
one
morning
near
his
bedroom
door
as
he
was
about
to
go
down
-
stairs
in
hunting
trim
,
"
Burgo
,
your
old
flame
,
Lady
Glencora
,
is
not
coming
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Lady
Glencora
not
coming
!
"
<EOS>
said
Burgo
,
betraying
by
his
look
and
the
tone
of
his
voice
too
clearly
that
this
change
in
the
purpose
of
a
married
lady
was
to
him
of
more
importance
than
it
should
have
been
.
<EOS>
Such
betrayal
,
however
,
to
Lady
Monk
was
not
perhaps
matter
of
much
moment
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
;
she
is
not
coming
.
<EOS>
It
ca
n't
be
matter
of
any
moment
to
you
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
by
heavens
,
it
is
,
"
said
he
,
putting
his
hand
up
to
his
forehead
,
and
leaning
back
against
the
wall
of
the
passage
as
though
in
despair
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
matter
of
moment
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
am
the
most
unfortunate
devil
that
ever
lived
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Fie
,
Burgo
,
fie
!
<EOS>
You
must
not
speak
in
that
way
of
a
married
woman
.
<EOS>
I
begin
to
think
it
is
better
that
she
should
not
come
.
"
<EOS>
At
this
moment
another
man
booted
and
spurred
came
down
the
passage
,
upon
whom
Lady
Monk
smiled
sweetly
,
speaking
some
pretty
little
word
as
he
passed
.
<EOS>
Burgo
spoke
never
a
word
,
but
still
stood
leaning
against
the
wall
,
with
his
hand
to
his
forehead
,
showing
that
he
had
heard
something
which
had
moved
him
greatly
.
<EOS>
"
Come
back
into
your
room
,
Burgo
,
"
said
his
aunt
;
and
they
both
went
in
at
the
door
that
was
nearest
to
them
,
for
Lady
Monk
had
been
on
the
look
-
out
for
him
,
and
had
caught
him
as
soon
as
he
appeared
in
the
passage
.
<EOS>
"
If
this
does
annoy
you
,
you
should
keep
it
to
yourself
!
<EOS>
What
will
people
say
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
can
I
help
what
they
say
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
would
not
wish
to
injure
her
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
I
thought
it
best
to
tell
you
,
for
fear
you
should
show
any
special
sign
of
surprise
if
you
heard
of
it
first
in
public
.
<EOS>
It
is
very
weak
in
you
to
allow
yourself
to
feel
that
sort
of
regard
for
a
married
woman
.
<EOS>
If
you
can
not
constrain
yourself
I
shall
be
afraid
to
let
you
meet
her
in
Brook
Street
.
"
  
<EOS>
Burgo
looked
for
a
moment
into
his
aunt
's
face
without
answering
her
,
and
then
turned
away
towards
the
door
.
<EOS>
"
You
can
do
as
you
please
about
that
,
"
said
he
;
"
but
you
know
as
well
as
I
do
what
I
have
made
up
my
mind
to
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nonsense
,
Burgo
;
I
know
nothing
of
the
kind
.
<EOS>
But
do
you
go
down
-
stairs
to
breakfast
,
and
do
n't
look
like
that
when
you
go
among
the
people
there
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lady
Monk
was
a
woman
now
about
fifty
years
of
age
,
who
had
been
a
great
beauty
,
and
who
was
still
handsome
in
her
advanced
age
.
<EOS>
Her
figure
was
very
good
.
<EOS>
She
was
tall
and
of
fine
proportion
,
though
by
no
means
verging
to
that
state
of
body
which
our
excellent
American
friend
and
critic
Mr.
Hawthorne
has
described
as
beefy
and
has
declared
to
be
the
general
condition
of
English
ladies
of
Lady
Monk
's
age
.
<EOS>
Lady
Monk
was
not
beefy
.
<EOS>
She
was
a
comely
,
handsome
,
upright
,
dame
,
 
one
of
whom
,
as
regards
her
outward
appearance
,
England
might
be
proud
,
 
and
of
whom
Sir
Cosmo
Monk
was
very
proud
.
<EOS>
She
had
come
of
the
family
of
the
Worcestershire
Fitzgeralds
,
of
whom
it
used
to
be
said
that
there
never
was
one
who
was
not
beautiful
and
worthless
.
<EOS>
Looking
at
Lady
Monk
you
would
hardly
think
that
she
could
be
a
worthless
woman
;
but
there
were
one
or
two
who
professed
to
know
her
,
and
who
declared
that
she
was
a
true
scion
of
the
family
to
which
she
belonged
;
 
that
even
her
husband
's
ample
fortune
had
suffered
from
her
extravagance
,
that
she
had
quarrelled
with
her
only
son
,
and
had
succeeded
in
marrying
her
daughter
to
the
greatest
fool
in
the
peerage
.
<EOS>
She
had
striven
very
hard
to
bring
about
a
marriage
between
her
nephew
and
the
great
heiress
,
and
was
a
woman
not
likely
to
pardon
those
who
had
foiled
her
.
  
<EOS>
At
this
moment
Burgo
felt
very
certain
that
his
aunt
was
aware
of
his
purpose
,
and
could
not
forgive
her
for
pretending
to
be
innocent
of
it
.
<EOS>
In
this
he
was
most
ungrateful
,
as
well
as
unreasonable
,
 
and
very
indiscreet
also
.
<EOS>
Had
he
been
a
man
who
ever
reflected
he
must
have
known
that
such
a
woman
as
his
aunt
could
only
assist
him
as
long
as
she
might
be
presumed
to
be
ignorant
of
his
intention
.
<EOS>
But
Burgo
never
reflected
.
<EOS>
The
Fitzgeralds
never
reflected
till
they
were
nearer
forty
than
thirty
,
and
then
people
began
to
think
worse
of
them
than
they
had
thought
before
.
  
<EOS>
When
Burgo
reached
the
dining
-
room
there
were
many
men
there
,
but
no
ladies
.
<EOS>
Sir
Cosmo
Monk
,
a
fine
bald
-
headed
hale
man
of
about
sixty
,
was
standing
up
at
the
sideboard
,
cutting
a
huge
game
pie
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
man
also
who
did
not
reflect
much
,
but
who
contrived
to
keep
straight
in
his
course
through
the
world
without
much
reflection
.
<EOS>
"
Palliser
is
coming
without
her
,
"
he
said
in
his
loud
clear
voice
,
thinking
nothing
of
his
wife
's
nephew
.
<EOS>
"
She
's
ill
,
she
says
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
'm
sorry
for
it
,
"
said
one
man
.
<EOS>
"
She
's
a
deal
the
better
fellow
of
the
two
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
has
twice
more
go
in
her
than
Planty
Pall
,
"
said
another
.
  
<EOS>
"
Planty
is
no
fool
,
I
can
tell
you
,
"
said
Sir
Cosmo
,
coming
to
the
table
with
his
plate
full
of
pie
.
<EOS>
"
We
think
he
's
about
the
most
rising
man
we
have
.
"
<EOS>
Sir
Cosmo
was
the
member
for
his
county
,
and
was
a
Liberal
.
<EOS>
He
had
once
,
when
a
much
younger
man
,
been
at
the
Treasury
,
and
had
since
always
spoken
of
the
Whig
Government
as
though
he
himself
were
in
some
sort
a
part
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Burgo
,
do
you
hear
that
Palliser
is
coming
without
his
wife
?
"
said
one
man
,
 
a
very
young
man
,
who
hardly
knew
what
had
been
the
circumstances
of
the
case
.
<EOS>
The
others
,
when
they
saw
Burgo
enter
,
had
been
silent
on
the
subject
of
Lady
Glencora
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
heard
,
 
and
be
d
 
<EOS>
---
d
to
him
,
"
said
Burgo
.
<EOS>
Then
there
was
suddenly
a
silence
in
the
room
,
and
everyone
seemed
to
attend
assiduously
to
his
breakfast
.
<EOS>
It
was
very
terrible
,
this
clear
expression
of
a
guilty
meaning
with
reference
to
the
wife
of
another
man
!
<EOS>
Burgo
regarded
neither
his
plate
nor
his
cup
,
but
thrusting
his
hands
into
his
breeches
pockets
,
sat
back
in
his
chair
with
the
blackness
as
of
a
thunder
cloud
upon
his
brow
.
  
<EOS>
"
Burgo
,
you
had
better
eat
your
breakfast
,
"
said
Sir
Cosmo
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
want
any
breakfast
.
"
<EOS>
He
took
,
however
,
a
bit
of
toast
,
and
crumbling
it
up
in
his
hand
as
he
put
a
morsel
into
his
mouth
,
went
away
to
the
sideboard
and
filled
for
himself
a
glass
of
cherry
brandy
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
do
n't
eat
any
breakfast
the
less
of
that
you
take
the
better
,
"
said
Sir
Cosmo
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
all
right
now
,
"
said
he
,
and
coming
back
to
the
table
,
went
through
some
form
of
making
a
meal
with
a
roll
and
a
cup
of
tea
.
  
<EOS>
They
who
were
then
present
used
afterwards
to
say
that
they
should
never
forget
that
breakfast
.
<EOS>
There
had
been
something
,
they
declared
,
in
the
tone
of
Burgo
's
voice
when
he
uttered
his
curse
against
Mr.
Palliser
,
which
had
struck
them
all
with
dread
.
<EOS>
There
had
,
too
,
they
said
,
been
a
blackness
in
his
face
,
so
terrible
to
be
seen
,
that
it
had
taken
from
them
all
the
power
of
conversation
.
<EOS>
Sir
Cosmo
,
when
he
had
broken
the
ominous
silence
,
had
done
so
with
a
manifest
struggle
.
<EOS>
The
loud
clatter
of
glasses
with
which
Burgo
had
swallowed
his
dram
,
as
though
resolved
to
show
that
he
was
regardless
who
might
know
that
he
was
drinking
,
added
to
the
feeling
.
<EOS>
It
may
easily
be
understood
that
there
was
no
further
word
spoken
at
that
breakfast
-
table
about
Planty
Pall
or
his
wife
.
  
<EOS>
On
that
day
Burgo
Fitzgerald
startled
all
those
who
saw
him
by
the
mad
way
in
which
he
rode
.
<EOS>
Early
in
the
day
there
was
no
excuse
for
any
such
rashness
.
<EOS>
The
hounds
went
from
wood
to
wood
,
and
men
went
in
troops
along
the
forest
sides
as
they
do
on
such
occasions
.
<EOS>
But
Burgo
was
seen
to
cram
his
horse
at
impracticable
places
,
and
to
ride
at
gates
and
rails
as
though
resolved
to
do
himself
and
his
uncle
's
<EOS>
steed
a
mischief
.
<EOS>
This
was
so
apparent
that
some
friend
spoke
to
Sir
Cosmo
Monk
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
do
nothing
,
"
said
Sir
Cosmo
.
<EOS>
"
He
is
a
man
whom
no
one
's
words
will
control
.
<EOS>
Something
has
ruffled
him
this
morning
,
and
he
must
run
his
chance
till
he
becomes
quiet
.
<EOS>
"
In
the
afternoon
there
was
a
good
run
,
and
Burgo
again
rode
as
hard
as
he
could
make
his
horse
carry
him
;
 
but
then
there
was
the
usual
excuse
for
hard
riding
;
and
such
riding
in
a
straight
run
is
not
dangerous
,
as
it
is
when
the
circumstances
of
the
occasion
do
not
warrant
it
,
But
<EOS>
,
be
that
as
it
may
,
Burgo
went
on
to
the
end
of
the
day
without
accident
,
and
as
he
went
home
,
assured
Sir
Cosmo
,
in
a
voice
which
was
almost
cheery
,
that
his
mare
Spinster
was
by
far
the
best
thing
in
the
Monkshade
stables
.
<EOS>
Indeed
Spinster
made
quite
a
character
that
day
,
and
was
sold
at
the
end
of
the
season
for
three
hundred
guineas
on
the
strength
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
am
,
however
,
inclined
to
believe
that
there
was
nothing
particular
about
the
mare
.
<EOS>
Horses
always
catch
the
temperament
of
their
riders
,
and
when
a
man
wishes
to
break
his
neck
,
he
will
generally
find
a
horse
willing
to
assist
him
in
appearance
,
but
able
to
save
him
in
the
performance
.
<EOS>
Burgo
,
at
any
rate
,
did
not
break
his
neck
,
and
appeared
at
the
dinner
-
table
in
a
better
humour
than
that
which
he
had
displayed
in
the
morning
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
day
appointed
Mr.
Palliser
reached
Monkshade
.
<EOS>
He
was
,
in
a
manner
,
canvassing
for
the
support
of
the
Liberal
party
,
and
it
would
not
have
suited
him
to
show
any
indifference
to
the
invitation
of
so
influential
a
man
as
Sir
Cosmo
.
<EOS>
Sir
Cosmo
had
a
little
party
of
his
own
in
the
House
,
consisting
of
four
or
five
other
respectable
country
gentlemen
,
who
troubled
themselves
little
with
thinking
,
and
who
mostly
had
bald
heads
.
<EOS>
Sir
Cosmo
was
a
man
with
whom
it
was
quite
necessary
that
such
an
aspirant
as
Mr.
Palliser
should
stand
well
,
and
therefore
Mr.
Palliser
came
to
Monkshade
,
although
Lady
Glencora
was
unable
to
accompany
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
are
so
sorry
,
"
said
Lady
Monk
.
<EOS>
"
We
have
been
looking
forward
to
having
Lady
Glencora
with
us
beyond
everything
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
declared
that
Lady
Glencora
herself
was
overwhelmed
with
grief
in
that
she
should
have
been
debarred
from
making
this
special
visit
.
<EOS>
She
had
,
however
,
been
so
unwell
at
Gatherum
,
the
anxious
husband
declared
,
as
to
make
it
unsafe
for
her
to
go
again
away
from
home
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
it
is
nothing
serious
,
"
said
Lady
Monk
,
with
a
look
of
grief
<EOS>
so
well
arranged
that
any
stranger
would
have
thought
that
all
the
Pallisers
must
have
been
very
dear
to
her
heart
.
<EOS>
Then
Mr.
Palliser
went
on
to
explain
that
Lady
Glencora
had
unfortunately
been
foolish
.
<EOS>
During
one
of
those
nights
of
hard
frost
she
had
gone
out
among
the
ruins
at
Matching
,
to
show
them
by
moonlight
to
a
friend
.
<EOS>
The
friend
had
thoughtlessly
,
foolishly
,
and
in
a
manner
which
Mr.
Palliser
declared
to
be
very
reprehensible
,
allowed
Lady
Glencora
to
remain
among
the
ruins
till
she
had
caught
cold
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
very
wrong
!
"
said
Lady
Monk
with
considerable
emphasis
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
very
wrong
,
"
said
Mr.
Palliser
,
speaking
of
poor
Alice
almost
maliciously
.
"
<EOS>
However
,
she
caught
a
cold
which
,
unfortunately
,
has
become
worse
at
my
uncle
's
,
and
so
I
was
obliged
to
take
her
home
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lady
Monk
perceived
that
Mr.
Palliser
had
in
truth
left
his
wife
behind
because
he
believed
her
to
be
ill
,
and
not
because
he
was
afraid
of
Burgo
Fitzgerald
.
<EOS>
So
accomplished
a
woman
as
Lady
Monk
felt
no
doubt
that
the
wife
's
absence
was
caused
by
fear
of
the
lover
,
and
not
by
any
cold
caught
in
viewing
ruins
by
moonlight
.
<EOS>
She
was
not
to
be
deceived
in
such
a
matter
.
<EOS>
But
she
became
aware
that
Mr.
Palliser
had
been
deceived
.
<EOS>
As
she
was
right
in
this
we
must
go
back
for
a
moment
,
and
say
a
word
of
things
as
they
went
on
at
Matching
after
Alice
Vavasor
had
left
that
place
.
  
<EOS>
Alice
had
told
Miss
Palliser
that
steps
ought
to
be
taken
,
whatever
might
be
their
cost
,
to
save
Lady
Glencora
from
the
peril
of
a
visit
to
Monkshade
.
<EOS>
To
this
Miss
Palliser
had
assented
,
and
,
when
she
left
Alice
,
was
determined
to
tell
Mr.
Palliser
the
whole
story
.
<EOS>
But
when
the
time
for
doing
so
had
come
,
her
courage
failed
her
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
find
words
in
which
to
warn
the
husband
that
his
wife
would
not
be
safe
in
the
company
of
her
old
lover
.
<EOS>
The
task
with
Lady
Glencora
herself
,
bad
as
that
would
be
,
might
be
easier
,
and
this
task
<EOS>
she
at
last
undertook
,
 
not
without
success
.
  
<EOS>
"
Glencora
,
"
she
said
,
when
she
found
a
fitting
opportunity
,
"
you
wo
n't
be
angry
,
I
hope
,
if
I
say
a
word
to
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
depends
very
much
upon
what
the
word
is
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
And
here
it
must
be
acknowledged
that
Mr.
Palliser
's
wife
had
not
done
much
to
ingratiate
herself
with
Mr.
Palliser
's
cousins
;
 
not
perhaps
so
much
as
she
should
have
done
,
seeing
that
she
found
them
in
her
husband
's
house
.
<EOS>
She
had
taught
herself
to
think
that
they
were
hard
,
stiff
,
and
too
proud
of
bearing
the
name
of
Palliser
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
some
little
attempt
may
have
been
made
by
one
or
both
of
them
to
teach
her
something
,
and
it
need
hardly
be
said
that
such
an
attempt
on
the
part
of
a
husband
's
unmarried
female
relations
would
not
be
forgiven
by
a
young
bride
.
<EOS>
She
had
undoubtedly
been
ungracious
,
and
of
this
Miss
Palliser
was
well
aware
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
 
the
word
shall
be
as
little
unpleasant
as
I
can
make
it
,
"
said
Miss
Palliser
,
already
appreciating
fully
the
difficulty
of
her
task
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
why
say
anything
that
is
unpleasant
?
<EOS>
However
,
if
it
is
to
be
said
,
let
us
have
it
over
at
once
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
going
to
Monkshade
,
I
believe
,
with
Plantagenet
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Well
;
 
and
what
of
that
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
Glencora
,
I
think
you
had
better
not
go
.
<EOS>
Do
you
not
think
so
yourself
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Who
has
been
talking
to
you
?
"
said
Lady
Glencora
,
turning
upon
her
very
sharply
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nobody
has
been
talking
to
me
;
 
not
in
the
sense
you
mean
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Plantagenet
has
spoken
to
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
a
word
,
"
said
Miss
Palliser
.
<EOS>
"
You
may
be
sure
that
he
would
not
utter
a
word
on
such
a
subject
to
anyone
unless
it
were
to
yourself
.
<EOS>
But
,
dear
Glencora
,
you
should
not
go
there
;
 
<EOS>
I
mean
it
in
all
kindness
and
love
,
 
I
do
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
Saying
this
she
offered
her
hand
to
Glencora
,
and
Glencora
took
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
you
do
,
"
said
she
in
a
low
voice
.
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
I
do
.
<EOS>
The
world
is
so
hard
and
cruel
in
what
it
says
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
do
not
care
two
straws
for
what
the
world
says
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
But
he
might
care
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
my
fault
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
want
to
go
to
Monkshade
.
<EOS>
Lady
Monk
was
my
friend
once
,
but
I
do
not
care
if
I
never
see
her
again
.
<EOS>
I
did
not
arrange
this
visit
.
<EOS>
It
was
Plantagenet
who
did
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
he
will
not
take
you
there
if
you
say
you
do
not
wish
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
said
so
,
and
he
told
me
that
I
must
go
.
<EOS>
You
will
hardly
believe
me
,
 
but
I
condescended
even
to
tell
him
why
I
thought
it
better
to
remain
away
.
<EOS>
He
told
me
,
in
answer
,
that
it
was
a
silly
folly
which
I
must
live
down
,
and
that
it
did
not
become
me
to
be
afraid
of
any
man
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
you
are
not
afraid
,
but
 
"
  
"
I
am
afraid
.
<EOS>
That
is
just
the
truth
.
<EOS>
I
am
afraid
;
 
but
what
can
I
do
more
than
I
have
done
?
"
  
<EOS>
This
was
very
terrible
to
Miss
Palliser
.
<EOS>
She
had
not
thought
that
Lady
Glencora
would
say
so
much
,
and
she
felt
a
true
regret
in
having
been
made
to
hear
words
which
so
nearly
amounted
to
a
confession
.
<EOS>
But
for
this
there
was
no
help
now
.
<EOS>
There
were
not
many
more
words
between
them
,
and
we
already
know
the
result
of
the
conversation
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
became
so
ill
from
the
effects
of
her
imprudent
lingering
among
the
ruins
that
she
was
unable
to
go
to
Monkshade
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
remained
three
days
at
Monkshade
,
and
cemented
his
political
alliance
with
Sir
Cosmo
much
in
the
same
way
as
he
had
before
done
with
the
Duke
of
St.
Bungay
.
<EOS>
There
was
little
or
nothing
said
about
politics
,
and
certainly
not
a
word
that
could
be
taken
as
any
definite
party
understanding
between
the
men
;
but
they
sat
at
dinner
together
at
the
same
table
,
drank
a
glass
of
wine
or
two
out
of
the
same
decanters
,
and
dropped
a
chance
word
now
and
again
about
the
next
session
of
Parliament
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
that
anything
more
had
been
expected
either
by
Mr.
Palliser
or
by
Sir
Cosmo
;
but
it
seemed
to
be
understood
when
Mr.
Palliser
went
away
that
Sir
Cosmo
was
of
opinion
that
that
young
scion
of
a
ducal
house
ought
to
become
the
future
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
in
the
Whig
Government
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
see
that
there
's
so
much
in
him
,
"
said
one
young
member
of
Parliament
to
Sir
Cosmo
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
rather
think
that
there
is
,
all
the
same
,
"
said
the
baronet
.
<EOS>
"
There
's
a
good
deal
in
him
,
I
believe
!
<EOS>
I
dare
say
he
's
not
very
bright
,
but
I
do
n't
know
that
we
want
brightness
.
<EOS>
A
bright
financier
is
the
most
dangerous
man
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
We
've
had
enough
of
that
already
.
<EOS>
Give
me
sound
common
sense
,
with
just
enough
of
the
gab
in
a
man
to
enable
him
to
say
what
he
's
got
to
say
!
<EOS>
We
do
n't
want
more
than
that
nowadays
.
"
<EOS>
From
which
it
became
evident
that
Sir
Cosmo
was
satisfied
with
the
new
political
candidate
for
high
place
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Monk
took
an
occasion
to
introduce
Mr.
Palliser
to
Burgo
Fitzgerald
;
with
what
object
it
is
difficult
to
say
,
unless
she
was
anxious
to
make
mischief
between
the
men
.
<EOS>
Burgo
scowled
at
him
;
but
Mr.
Palliser
did
not
notice
the
scowl
,
and
put
out
his
hand
to
his
late
rival
most
affably
.
<EOS>
Burgo
was
forced
to
take
it
,
and
as
he
did
so
made
a
little
speech
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
sorry
that
we
have
not
the
pleasure
of
seeing
Lady
Glencora
with
you
,
"
said
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
is
unfortunately
indisposed
,
"
said
Mr.
Palliser
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
for
it
,
"
said
Burgo
 
"
very
sorry
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
Then
he
turned
his
back
and
walked
away
.
<EOS>
The
few
words
he
had
spoken
,
and
the
manner
in
which
he
had
carried
himself
,
had
been
such
as
to
make
all
those
around
them
notice
it
.
<EOS>
Each
of
them
knew
that
Lady
Glencora
's
name
should
not
have
been
in
Burgo
's
mouth
,
and
all
felt
a
fear
not
easily
to
be
defined
that
something
terrible
would
come
of
it
.
<EOS>
But
Mr.
Palliser
himself
did
not
seem
to
notice
anything
,
or
to
fear
anything
;
and
nothing
terrible
did
come
of
it
during
that
visit
of
his
to
Monkshade
.
   
<EOS>
Mr.
Vavasor
Speaks
to
His
Daughter
.
 
<EOS>
Alice
Vavasor
returned
to
London
with
her
father
,
leaving
Kate
at
Vavasor
Hall
with
her
grandfather
.
<EOS>
The
journey
was
not
a
pleasant
one
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Vavasor
knew
that
it
was
his
duty
to
do
something
,
 
to
take
some
steps
with
the
view
of
preventing
the
marriage
which
his
daughter
meditated
;
but
he
did
not
know
what
that
something
should
be
,
and
he
did
know
that
,
whatever
it
might
be
,
the
doing
of
it
would
be
thoroughly
disagreeable
.
<EOS>
When
they
started
from
Vavasor
he
had
as
yet
hardly
spoken
to
her
a
word
upon
the
subject
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
congratulate
you
,
"
he
had
simply
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
hope
the
time
may
come
,
papa
,
when
you
will
,
"
Alice
had
answered
;
and
that
had
been
all
.
  
<EOS>
The
squire
had
promised
that
he
would
consent
to
a
reconciliation
with
his
grandson
,
if
Alice
's
father
would
express
himself
satisfied
with
the
proposed
marriage
.
<EOS>
John
Vavasor
had
certainly
expressed
nothing
of
the
kind
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
so
badly
of
him
,
"
he
had
said
,
speaking
to
the
old
man
of
George
,
"
that
I
would
rather
know
that
almost
any
other
calamity
was
to
befall
her
,
than
that
she
should
be
united
to
him
.
"
<EOS>
Then
the
squire
,
with
his
usual
obstinacy
,
had
taken
up
the
cudgels
on
behalf
of
his
grandson
;
and
had
tried
to
prove
that
the
match
after
all
would
not
be
so
bad
in
its
results
as
his
son
seemed
to
expect
.
<EOS>
"
It
would
do
very
well
for
the
property
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
settle
the
estate
on
their
eldest
son
,
so
that
he
could
not
touch
it
;
and
I
do
n't
see
why
he
should
n't
reform
as
well
as
another
.
"
<EOS>
John
Vavasor
had
then
declared
that
George
was
thoroughly
bad
,
that
he
was
an
adventurer
;
that
he
believed
him
to
be
a
ruined
man
,
and
that
he
would
never
reform
.
<EOS>
The
squire
upon
this
had
waxed
angry
,
and
in
this
way
George
obtained
aid
and
assistance
down
at
the
old
house
,
which
he
certainly
had
no
right
to
expect
.
<EOS>
When
Alice
wished
her
grandfather
good
-
bye
the
old
man
gave
her
a
message
to
his
grandson
.
<EOS>
"
You
may
tell
him
,
"
said
he
,
"
that
I
will
never
see
him
again
unless
he
begs
my
pardon
for
his
personal
bad
conduct
to
me
,
but
that
if
he
marries
you
,
I
will
take
care
that
the
property
is
properly
settled
upon
his
child
and
yours
.
<EOS>
I
shall
always
be
glad
to
see
you
,
my
dear
;
and
for
your
sake
,
I
will
see
him
if
he
will
humble
himself
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
There
was
no
word
spoken
then
about
her
father
's
consent
;
and
Alice
,
when
she
left
Vavasor
,
felt
that
the
squire
was
rather
her
friend
than
her
enemy
in
regard
to
this
thing
which
she
contemplated
.
<EOS>
That
her
father
was
and
would
be
an
uncompromising
enemy
to
her
,
 
uncompromising
though
probably
not
energetical
,
 
<EOS>
she
was
well
aware
;
and
,
therefore
,
the
journey
up
to
London
was
not
comfortable
.
  
<EOS>
Alice
had
resolved
,
with
great
pain
to
herself
,
that
in
this
matter
she
owed
her
father
no
obedience
.
<EOS>
"
There
can
not
be
obedience
on
one
side
,
"
she
said
to
herself
,
"
without
protection
and
support
on
the
other
.
"
<EOS>
Now
it
was
quite
true
that
John
Vavasor
had
done
little
in
the
way
of
supporting
or
protecting
his
daughter
.
<EOS>
Early
in
life
,
before
she
had
resided
under
the
same
roof
with
him
in
London
,
he
had
,
as
it
were
,
washed
his
hands
of
all
solicitude
regarding
her
;
and
having
no
other
ties
of
family
,
had
fallen
into
habits
of
life
which
made
it
almost
impossible
for
him
to
live
with
her
as
any
other
father
would
live
with
his
child
.
<EOS>
Then
,
when
there
first
sprang
up
between
them
that
manner
of
sharing
the
same
house
without
any
joining
together
of
their
habits
of
life
,
he
had
excused
himself
to
himself
by
saying
that
Alice
was
unlike
other
girls
,
and
that
she
required
no
protection
.
<EOS>
Her
fortune
was
her
own
,
and
at
her
own
disposal
.
<EOS>
Her
character
was
such
that
she
showed
no
inclination
to
throw
the
burden
of
such
disposal
on
her
father
's
shoulders
.
<EOS>
She
was
steady
,
too
,
and
given
to
no
pursuits
which
made
it
necessary
that
he
should
watch
closely
over
her
.
<EOS>
She
was
a
girl
,
he
thought
,
who
could
do
as
well
without
surveillance
as
with
it
,
 
as
well
,
or
perhaps
better
.
<EOS>
So
it
had
come
to
pass
that
Alice
had
been
the
free
mistress
of
her
own
actions
,
and
had
been
left
to
make
the
most
she
could
of
her
own
hours
.
<EOS>
It
can
not
be
supposed
that
she
had
eaten
her
lonely
dinners
in
Queen
Anne
Street
night
after
night
,
week
after
week
,
month
after
month
,
without
telling
herself
that
her
father
was
neglecting
her
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
perceive
that
he
spent
every
evening
in
society
,
but
never
an
evening
in
her
society
,
without
feeling
that
the
tie
between
her
<EOS>
and
him
was
not
the
strong
bond
which
usually
binds
a
father
to
his
child
.
<EOS>
She
was
well
aware
that
she
had
been
ill
-
used
in
being
thus
left
desolate
in
her
home
.
<EOS>
She
had
uttered
no
word
of
complaint
;
but
she
had
learned
,
without
being
aware
that
she
was
doing
so
,
to
entertain
a
firm
resolve
that
her
father
should
not
guide
her
in
her
path
through
life
.
<EOS>
In
that
affair
of
John
Grey
they
had
both
for
a
time
thought
alike
,
and
Mr.
Vavasor
had
believed
that
his
theory
with
reference
to
Alice
had
been
quite
correct
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
left
to
herself
,
and
was
going
to
dispose
of
herself
in
a
way
than
which
nothing
could
be
more
eligible
.
<EOS>
But
evil
days
were
now
coming
,
and
Mr.
Vavasor
,
as
he
travelled
up
to
London
,
with
his
daughter
seated
opposite
to
him
in
the
railway
carriage
,
felt
that
now
,
at
last
,
he
must
interfere
.
<EOS>
In
part
of
the
journey
they
had
the
carriage
to
themselves
,
and
Mr.
Vavasor
thought
that
he
would
begin
what
he
had
to
say
;
but
he
put
it
off
till
others
joined
them
,
and
then
there
was
no
further
opportunity
for
such
conversation
as
that
which
would
be
necessary
between
them
.
<EOS>
They
reached
home
about
eight
in
the
evening
,
having
dined
on
the
road
.
<EOS>
"
She
will
be
tired
to
-
night
,
"
he
said
to
himself
,
as
he
went
off
to
his
club
,
"
and
I
will
speak
to
her
to
-
morrow
.
"
<EOS>
Alice
specially
felt
his
going
on
this
evening
.
<EOS>
When
two
persons
had
together
the
tedium
of
such
a
journey
as
that
from
Westmoreland
up
to
London
,
there
should
be
some
feeling
between
them
to
bind
them
together
while
enjoying
the
comfort
of
the
evening
.
<EOS>
Had
he
stayed
and
sat
with
her
at
her
tea
-
table
,
Alice
would
at
any
rate
have
endeavoured
to
be
soft
with
him
in
any
discussion
that
might
have
been
raised
;
but
he
went
away
from
her
at
once
,
leaving
her
to
think
alone
over
the
perils
of
the
life
before
her
.
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
speak
to
you
after
breakfast
to
-
morrow
,
"
he
said
as
he
went
out
.
<EOS>
Alice
answered
that
she
should
be
there
,
 
as
a
matter
of
course
.
<EOS>
She
scorned
to
tell
him
that
she
was
always
there
,
 
always
alone
at
home
.
<EOS>
She
had
never
uttered
a
word
of
complaint
,
and
she
would
not
begin
now
.
  
<EOS>
The
discussion
after
breakfast
the
next
day
was
commenced
with
formal
and
almost
ceremonial
preparation
.
<EOS>
The
father
and
daughter
breakfasted
together
,
with
the
knowledge
that
the
discussion
was
coming
.
<EOS>
It
did
not
give
to
either
of
them
a
good
appetite
,
and
very
little
was
said
at
table
.
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
come
up
-
stairs
?
"
<EOS>
said
Alice
,
when
she
perceived
that
her
father
had
finished
his
tea
.
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
that
will
be
best
,
"
said
he
.
<EOS>
Then
he
followed
her
into
the
drawing
-
room
in
which
the
fire
had
just
been
lit
.
  
<EOS>
"
Alice
,
"
said
he
,
"
I
must
speak
to
you
about
this
engagement
of
yours
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Wo
n't
you
sit
down
,
papa
?
<EOS>
It
does
look
so
dreadful
,
your
standing
up
over
one
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
"
He
had
placed
himself
on
the
rug
with
his
back
to
the
incipient
fire
,
but
now
,
at
her
request
,
he
sat
himself
down
opposite
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
greatly
grieved
when
I
heard
of
this
at
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
that
you
should
be
grieved
,
papa
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
grieved
.
<EOS>
I
must
confess
that
I
never
could
understand
why
you
treated
Mr.
Grey
as
you
have
done
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
papa
,
that
's
done
and
past
.
<EOS>
Pray
let
that
be
among
the
bygones
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Does
he
know
yet
of
your
engagement
with
your
cousin
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
will
know
it
by
this
time
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
I
beg
of
you
,
as
a
great
favour
,
to
postpone
your
letter
to
him
.
"
<EOS>
To
this
Alice
made
no
answer
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
troubled
you
with
many
such
requests
,
Alice
.
<EOS>
Will
you
tell
me
that
this
one
shall
be
granted
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
that
I
owe
it
to
him
as
an
imperative
duty
to
let
him
know
the
truth
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
may
change
your
mind
again
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Alice
found
that
this
was
hard
to
bear
and
hard
to
answer
;
but
there
was
a
certain
amount
of
truth
in
the
grievous
reproach
conveyed
in
her
father
's
words
,
which
made
her
bow
her
neck
to
it
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
right
to
say
that
it
is
impossible
,
"
she
replied
,
in
words
that
were
barely
audible
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
 
exactly
so
,
"
said
her
father
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
therefore
it
will
be
better
that
you
should
postpone
any
such
communication
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
For
how
long
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Till
you
and
I
shall
have
agreed
together
that
he
should
be
told
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
No
,
papa
;
I
will
not
consent
to
that
.
<EOS>
I
consider
myself
bound
to
let
him
know
the
truth
without
delay
.
<EOS>
I
have
done
him
a
great
injury
,
and
I
must
put
an
end
to
that
as
soon
as
possible
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
done
him
an
injury
certainly
,
my
dear
;
 
a
very
great
injury
,
"
said
Mr.
Vavasor
,
going
away
from
his
object
about
the
proposed
letter
;
"
and
I
believe
he
will
feel
it
as
such
to
the
last
day
of
his
life
,
if
this
goes
on
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
not
.
<EOS>
I
believe
that
it
will
not
be
so
.
<EOS>
I
feel
sure
that
it
will
not
be
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
But
of
course
what
I
am
thinking
of
now
is
your
welfare
,
 
not
his
.
<EOS>
When
you
simply
told
me
that
you
intended
to
 
.
<EOS>
"
Alice
winced
,
for
she
feared
to
hear
from
her
father
that
odious
word
which
her
grandfather
had
used
to
her
;
and
indeed
the
word
had
been
on
her
father
's
lips
,
but
he
had
refrained
and
spared
her
 
"
that
you
intended
to
break
your
engagement
with
Mr.
Grey
,
"
he
continued
,
"
I
said
little
or
nothing
to
you
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
ask
you
to
marry
any
man
,
even
though
you
had
yourself
promised
to
marry
him
.
<EOS>
But
when
you
tell
me
that
you
are
engaged
to
your
cousin
George
,
the
matter
is
very
different
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
well
of
your
cousin
.
<EOS>
Indeed
I
think
anything
but
well
of
him
.
<EOS>
It
is
my
duty
to
tell
you
that
the
world
speaks
very
ill
of
him
.
"
<EOS>
He
paused
,
but
Alice
remained
silent
.
<EOS>
"
When
you
were
about
to
travel
with
him
,
"
he
continued
,
"
I
ought
perhaps
to
have
told
you
the
same
.
<EOS>
But
I
did
not
wish
to
pain
you
or
his
sister
;
and
,
moreover
,
I
have
heard
worse
of
him
since
then
,
 
much
worse
than
I
had
heard
before
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
As
you
did
not
tell
me
before
,
I
think
you
might
spare
me
now
,
"
said
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
my
dear
;
I
can
not
allow
you
to
sacrifice
yourself
without
telling
you
that
you
are
doing
so
.
<EOS>
If
it
were
not
for
your
money
he
would
never
think
of
marrying
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
that
I
am
well
aware
,
"
said
Alice
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
has
told
me
so
himself
very
plainly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
yet
you
will
marry
him
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Certainly
I
will
.
<EOS>
It
seems
to
me
,
papa
,
that
there
is
a
great
deal
of
false
feeling
about
this
matter
of
money
in
marriage
,
 
or
rather
,
perhaps
,
a
great
deal
of
pretended
feeling
.
<EOS>
Why
should
I
be
angry
with
a
man
for
wishing
to
get
that
for
which
every
man
is
struggling
?
<EOS>
At
this
point
of
George
's
career
the
use
of
money
is
essential
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
marry
without
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
had
better
then
give
him
your
money
without
yourself
,
"
said
her
father
,
speaking
in
irony
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
just
what
I
mean
to
do
,
papa
,
"
said
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
!
"
said
Mr.
Vavasor
,
jumping
up
from
his
seat
.
<EOS>
"
You
mean
to
give
him
your
money
before
you
marry
him
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Certainly
I
do
;
 
if
he
should
want
it
;
 
or
,
I
should
rather
say
,
as
much
as
he
may
want
of
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Heavens
and
earth
!
"
exclaimed
Mr.
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
"
Alice
,
you
must
be
mad
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
To
part
with
my
money
to
my
friend
?
"
said
she
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
kind
of
madness
of
which
I
need
not
at
any
rate
<EOS>
be
ashamed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Tell
me
this
,
Alice
;
has
he
got
any
of
it
as
yet
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
a
shilling
.
<EOS>
Papa
,
pray
do
not
look
at
me
like
that
.
<EOS>
If
I
had
no
thought
of
marrying
him
you
would
not
call
me
mad
because
I
lent
to
my
cousin
what
money
he
might
need
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
only
say
that
so
much
of
your
fortune
was
thrown
away
,
and
if
it
were
not
much
that
would
be
an
end
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
would
sooner
see
you
surrender
to
him
the
half
of
all
you
have
,
without
any
engagement
to
marry
him
,
than
know
that
he
had
received
a
shilling
from
you
under
such
a
promise
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
prejudiced
against
him
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Was
it
prejudice
that
made
you
reject
him
once
before
?
<EOS>
Did
you
condemn
him
then
through
prejudice
?
<EOS>
Had
you
not
ascertained
that
he
was
altogether
unworthy
of
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
were
both
younger
,
then
,
"
said
Alice
,
speaking
very
softly
,
but
very
seriously
.
<EOS>
"
We
were
both
much
younger
then
,
and
looked
at
life
with
other
eyes
than
those
which
we
now
use
.
<EOS>
For
myself
I
expected
much
then
,
which
I
now
seem
hardly
to
regard
at
all
;
and
as
for
him
,
he
was
then
attached
to
pleasures
to
which
I
believe
he
has
now
learned
to
be
indifferent
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Psha
!
"
ejaculated
the
father
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
only
speak
as
I
believe
,
"
continued
Alice
.
"
<EOS>
And
I
think
I
may
perhaps
know
more
of
his
manner
of
life
than
you
do
,
papa
.
<EOS>
But
I
am
prepared
to
run
risks
now
which
I
feared
before
.
<EOS>
Even
though
he
were
all
that
you
think
him
to
be
,
I
would
still
endeavour
to
do
my
duty
to
him
,
and
to
bring
him
to
other
things
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
it
you
expect
to
get
by
marrying
him
?
"
asked
Mr.
Vavasor
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
husband
whose
mode
of
thinking
is
congenial
to
my
own
,
"
answered
Alice
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
husband
who
proposes
to
himself
a
career
in
life
with
which
I
can
sympathize
.
<EOS>
I
think
that
I
may
perhaps
help
my
cousin
in
the
career
which
he
has
chosen
,
and
that
alone
is
a
great
reason
why
I
should
attempt
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
With
your
money
?
"
said
Mr.
Vavasor
with
a
sneer
.
  
<EOS>
"
Partly
with
my
money
,
"
said
Alice
,
disdaining
to
answer
the
sneer
.
<EOS>
"
Though
it
were
only
with
my
money
,
even
that
would
be
something
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Alice
,
as
your
father
,
I
can
only
implore
you
to
pause
before
you
commit
yourself
to
his
hands
.
<EOS>
If
he
demands
money
from
you
,
and
you
are
minded
to
give
it
to
him
,
let
him
have
it
in
moderation
.
<EOS>
Anything
will
be
better
than
marrying
him
.
<EOS>
I
know
that
I
can
not
hinder
you
;
you
are
as
much
your
own
mistress
as
I
am
my
own
master
,
 
or
rather
a
great
deal
more
,
as
my
income
depends
on
my
going
to
that
horrid
place
in
Chancery
Lane
.
<EOS>
But
yet
I
suppose
you
must
think
something
of
your
father
's
wishes
and
your
father
's
opinion
.
<EOS>
It
will
not
be
pleasant
for
you
to
stand
at
the
altar
without
my
being
there
near
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
To
this
Alice
made
no
answer
;
but
she
told
herself
that
it
had
not
been
pleasant
to
her
to
have
stood
at
so
many
places
during
the
last
four
years
,
 
and
to
have
found
herself
so
often
alone
,
 
without
her
father
being
near
to
her
.
<EOS>
That
had
been
his
fault
,
and
it
was
not
now
in
her
power
to
remedy
the
ill
-
effects
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Has
any
day
been
fixed
between
you
and
him
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
papa
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nothing
has
been
said
about
that
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
something
has
been
said
.
<EOS>
I
have
told
him
that
it
can
not
be
for
a
year
yet
.
<EOS>
It
is
because
I
told
him
that
,
that
I
told
him
also
that
he
should
have
my
money
when
he
wanted
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
all
of
it
?
"
said
Mr.
Vavasor
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
suppose
he
will
need
it
all
.
<EOS>
He
intends
to
stand
again
for
Chelsea
,
and
it
is
the
great
expense
of
the
election
which
makes
him
want
money
.
<EOS>
You
are
not
to
suppose
that
he
has
asked
me
for
it
.
<EOS>
When
I
made
him
understand
that
I
did
not
wish
to
marry
quite
yet
,
I
offered
him
the
use
of
that
which
would
be
ultimately
his
own
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
he
has
accepted
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
answered
me
just
as
I
had
intended
,
 
that
when
the
need
came
he
would
take
me
at
my
word
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
,
Alice
,
I
will
tell
you
what
is
my
belief
.
<EOS>
He
will
drain
you
of
every
shilling
of
your
money
,
and
when
that
is
gone
,
there
will
be
no
more
heard
of
the
marriage
.
<EOS>
We
must
take
a
small
house
in
some
cheap
part
of
the
town
and
live
on
my
income
as
best
we
may
.
<EOS>
I
shall
go
and
insure
my
life
,
so
that
you
may
not
absolutely
starve
when
I
die
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Having
said
this
,
Mr.
Vavasor
went
away
,
not
immediately
to
the
insurance
office
,
as
his
words
seemed
to
imply
,
but
to
his
club
where
he
sat
alone
,
reading
the
newspaper
,
very
gloomily
,
till
the
time
came
for
his
afternoon
rubber
of
whist
,
and
the
club
dinner
bill
for
the
day
was
brought
under
his
eye
.
  
<EOS>
Alice
had
no
such
consolations
in
her
solitude
.
<EOS>
She
had
fought
her
battle
with
her
father
tolerably
well
,
but
she
was
now
called
upon
to
fight
a
battle
with
herself
,
which
was
one
much
more
difficult
to
win
.
<EOS>
Was
her
cousin
,
her
betrothed
as
she
now
must
regard
him
,
the
worthless
,
heartless
,
mercenary
rascal
which
her
father
painted
him
?
<EOS>
There
had
certainly
been
a
time
,
and
that
not
very
long
distant
,
in
which
Alice
herself
had
been
almost
constrained
so
to
regard
him
.
<EOS>
Since
that
any
change
for
the
better
in
her
opinion
of
him
had
been
grounded
on
evidence
given
either
by
himself
or
by
his
sister
Kate
.
<EOS>
He
had
done
nothing
to
inspire
her
with
any
confidence
,
unless
his
reckless
daring
in
coming
forward
to
contest
a
seat
in
Parliament
could
be
regarded
as
a
doing
of
something
.
<EOS>
And
he
had
owned
himself
to
be
a
man
almost
penniless
;
he
had
spoken
of
himself
as
being
utterly
reckless
,
 
as
being
one
whose
standing
in
the
world
was
and
must
continue
to
be
a
perch
on
the
edge
of
a
precipice
,
from
which
any
accident
might
knock
him
headlong
.
<EOS>
Alice
believed
in
her
heart
that
this
last
profession
or
trade
to
which
he
had
applied
himself
,
was
becoming
as
nothing
to
him
,
 
that
he
received
from
it
no
certain
income
;
 
no
income
that
a
man
could
make
to
appear
respectable
to
fathers
or
guardians
when
seeking
a
girl
in
marriage
.
<EOS>
Her
father
declared
that
all
men
spoke
badly
of
him
.
<EOS>
Alice
knew
her
father
to
be
an
idle
man
,
a
man
given
to
pleasure
,
to
be
one
who
thought
by
far
too
much
of
the
good
things
of
the
world
;
but
she
had
never
found
him
to
be
either
false
or
malicious
.
<EOS>
His
unwonted
energy
in
this
matter
was
in
itself
evidence
that
he
believed
himself
to
be
right
in
what
he
said
.
  
<EOS>
To
tell
the
truth
,
Alice
was
frightened
at
what
she
had
done
,
and
almost
repented
of
it
already
.
<EOS>
Her
acceptance
of
her
cousin
's
offer
had
not
come
of
love
;
 
nor
had
it
,
in
truth
,
come
chiefly
of
ambition
.
<EOS>
She
had
not
so
much
asked
herself
why
she
should
do
this
thing
,
as
why
she
should
not
do
it
,
 
seeing
that
it
was
required
of
her
by
her
friend
.
<EOS>
What
after
all
did
it
matter
?
<EOS>
That
was
her
argument
with
herself
.
<EOS>
It
can
not
be
supposed
that
she
looked
back
on
the
past
events
of
her
life
with
any
self
-
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
self
-
satisfaction
,
but
in
truth
there
was
more
self
-
reproach
than
she
deserved
.
<EOS>
As
a
girl
she
had
loved
her
cousin
George
passionately
,
and
that
love
had
failed
her
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
tell
herself
that
she
had
been
wrong
when
she
gave
him
up
,
but
she
thought
herself
to
have
been
most
unfortunate
in
the
one
necessity
.
<EOS>
After
such
an
experience
as
that
,
would
it
not
have
been
better
for
her
to
have
remained
without
further
thought
of
marriage
?
  
<EOS>
Then
came
that
terrible
episode
in
her
life
for
which
she
never
could
forgive
herself
.
<EOS>
She
had
accepted
Mr.
Grey
because
she
liked
him
and
honoured
him
.
"
<EOS>
And
I
did
love
him
,
"
she
said
to
herself
,
now
on
this
morning
.
<EOS>
Poor
,
wretched
,
heart
-
wrung
woman
!
<EOS>
As
she
sat
there
thinking
of
it
all
in
her
solitude
she
was
to
be
pitied
at
any
rate
,
if
not
to
be
forgiven
.
<EOS>
Now
,
as
she
thought
of
Nethercoats
,
with
its
quiet
life
,
its
gardens
,
its
books
,
and
the
peaceful
affectionate
ascendancy
of
him
who
would
have
been
her
lord
and
master
,
her
feelings
were
very
different
from
those
which
had
induced
her
to
resolve
that
she
would
not
stoop
to
put
her
neck
beneath
that
yoke
.
<EOS>
Would
it
not
have
been
well
for
her
to
have
a
master
who
by
his
wisdom
and
strength
could
save
her
from
such
wretched
doubtings
as
these
?
<EOS>
But
she
had
refused
to
bend
,
and
then
she
had
found
herself
desolate
and
alone
in
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
can
do
him
good
why
should
I
not
marry
him
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
In
that
feeling
had
been
the
chief
argument
which
had
induced
her
to
return
such
an
answer
as
she
had
sent
to
her
cousin
.
"
<EOS>
For
myself
,
what
does
it
matter
?
<EOS>
As
to
this
life
of
mine
and
all
that
belongs
to
it
,
why
should
I
regard
it
otherwise
than
to
make
it
of
some
service
to
some
one
who
is
dear
to
me
?
"
<EOS>
He
had
been
ever
dear
to
her
from
her
earliest
years
.
<EOS>
She
believed
in
his
intellect
,
even
if
she
could
not
believe
in
his
conduct
.
<EOS>
Kate
,
her
friend
,
longed
for
this
thing
.
<EOS>
As
for
that
dream
of
love
,
it
meant
nothing
;
and
as
for
those
arguments
of
prudence
,
 
that
cold
calculation
about
her
money
,
which
all
people
seemed
to
expect
from
her
,
 
she
would
throw
it
to
the
winds
.
<EOS>
What
if
she
were
ruined
!
<EOS>
There
was
always
the
other
chance
.
<EOS>
She
might
save
him
from
ruin
,
and
help
him
to
honour
and
fortune
.
  
<EOS>
But
then
,
when
the
word
was
once
past
her
lips
,
there
returned
to
her
that
true
woman
's
feeling
which
made
her
plead
for
a
long
day
,
 
which
made
her
feel
that
that
long
day
would
be
all
too
short
,
 
which
made
her
already
dread
the
coming
of
the
end
of
the
year
.
<EOS>
She
had
said
that
she
would
become
George
Vavasor
's
wife
,
but
she
wished
that
the
saying
so
might
be
the
end
of
it
.
<EOS>
When
he
came
to
her
to
embrace
her
how
should
she
receive
him
?
<EOS>
The
memory
of
John
Grey
's
last
kiss
still
lingered
on
her
lips
.
<EOS>
She
had
told
herself
that
she
scorned
the
delights
of
love
;
if
it
were
so
,
was
she
not
bound
to
keep
herself
far
from
them
;
if
it
were
so
,
 
would
not
her
cousin
's
kiss
pollute
her
?
  
<EOS>
"
It
may
be
as
my
father
says
,
"
she
thought
.
<EOS>
"
It
may
be
that
he
wants
my
money
only
;
if
so
,
let
him
have
it
.
<EOS>
Surely
when
the
year
is
over
I
shall
know
.
<EOS>
"
Then
a
plan
formed
itself
in
her
head
,
which
she
did
not
make
willingly
,
with
any
voluntary
action
of
her
mind
,
 
but
which
came
upon
her
as
plans
do
come
,
 
and
recommended
itself
to
her
in
despite
of
herself
.
<EOS>
He
should
have
her
money
as
he
might
call
for
it
,
 
all
of
it
excepting
some
small
portion
of
her
income
,
which
might
suffice
to
keep
her
from
burdening
her
father
.
<EOS>
Then
,
if
he
were
contented
,
he
should
go
free
,
without
reproach
,
and
there
should
be
an
end
of
all
question
of
marriage
for
her
.
  
<EOS>
As
she
thought
of
this
,
and
matured
it
in
her
mind
,
the
door
opened
,
and
the
servant
announced
her
cousin
George
.
   
<EOS>
Passion
versus
Prudence
.
 
<EOS>
It
had
not
occurred
to
Alice
that
her
accepted
lover
would
come
to
her
so
soon
.
<EOS>
She
had
not
told
him
expressly
of
the
day
on
which
she
would
return
,
and
had
not
reflected
that
Kate
would
certainly
inform
him
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
thinking
so
much
of
the
distant
perils
of
this
engagement
,
that
this
peril
,
so
sure
to
come
upon
her
before
many
days
or
hours
could
pass
by
,
had
been
forgotten
.
<EOS>
When
the
name
struck
her
ear
,
and
George
's
step
was
heard
outside
on
the
landing
-
place
,
she
felt
the
blood
rush
violently
to
her
heart
,
and
she
jumped
up
from
her
seat
panic
-
stricken
and
in
utter
dismay
.
<EOS>
How
should
she
receive
him
?
<EOS>
And
then
again
,
with
what
form
of
affection
would
she
be
accosted
by
him
?
<EOS>
But
he
was
there
in
the
room
with
her
before
she
had
had
a
moment
allowed
to
her
for
thought
.
  
<EOS>
She
hardly
ventured
to
look
up
at
him
;
but
,
nevertheless
,
she
became
aware
that
there
was
something
in
his
appearance
and
dress
brighter
,
more
lover
-
like
,
perhaps
newer
,
than
was
usual
with
him
.
<EOS>
This
in
itself
was
an
affliction
to
her
.
<EOS>
He
ought
to
have
understood
that
such
an
engagement
as
theirs
not
only
did
not
require
,
but
absolutely
forbade
,
any
such
symptom
of
young
love
as
this
.
<EOS>
Even
when
their
marriage
came
,
if
it
must
come
,
it
should
come
without
any
customary
sign
of
smartness
,
without
any
outward
mark
of
exaltation
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
been
very
good
in
him
to
have
remained
away
from
her
for
weeks
and
months
;
but
to
come
upon
her
thus
,
on
the
first
morning
of
her
return
,
was
a
cruelty
not
to
be
forgiven
.
<EOS>
These
were
the
feelings
with
which
Alice
regarded
her
betrothed
when
he
came
to
see
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Alice
,
"
said
he
,
coming
up
to
her
with
his
extended
hand
,
 
"
Dearest
Alice
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
gave
him
her
hand
,
and
muttered
some
word
which
was
inaudible
even
to
him
;
she
gave
him
her
hand
,
and
immediately
endeavoured
to
resume
it
,
but
he
held
it
clenched
within
his
own
,
and
she
felt
that
she
was
his
prisoner
.
<EOS>
He
was
standing
close
to
her
now
,
and
she
could
not
escape
from
him
.
<EOS>
She
was
trembling
with
fear
lest
worse
might
betide
her
even
than
this
.
<EOS>
She
had
promised
to
marry
him
,
and
now
she
was
covered
with
dismay
as
she
felt
rather
than
thought
how
very
far
she
was
from
loving
the
man
to
whom
she
had
given
this
promise
.
  
<EOS>
"
Alice
,
"
he
said
,
"
I
am
a
man
once
again
.
<EOS>
It
is
only
now
that
I
can
tell
you
what
I
have
suffered
during
these
last
few
years
.
"
<EOS>
He
still
held
her
hand
,
but
he
had
not
as
yet
attempted
any
closer
embrace
.
<EOS>
She
knew
that
she
was
standing
away
from
him
awkwardly
,
almost
showing
her
repugnance
to
him
;
but
it
was
altogether
beyond
her
power
to
assume
an
attitude
of
ordinary
ease
.
<EOS>
"
Alice
,
"
he
continued
,
"
I
feel
that
I
am
a
strong
man
again
,
armed
to
meet
the
world
at
all
points
.
<EOS>
Will
you
not
let
me
thank
you
for
what
you
have
done
for
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
must
speak
to
him
!
<EOS>
Though
the
doing
so
should
be
ever
so
painful
to
her
,
she
must
say
some
word
to
him
which
should
have
in
it
a
sound
of
kindness
.
<EOS>
After
all
,
it
was
his
undoubted
right
to
come
to
her
,
and
the
footing
on
which
he
assumed
to
stand
was
simply
that
which
she
herself
had
given
to
him
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
his
fault
if
at
this
moment
he
inspired
her
with
disgust
rather
than
with
love
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
done
nothing
for
you
,
George
,
"
she
said
,
"
nothing
at
all
.
"
<EOS>
Then
she
got
her
hand
away
from
him
,
and
retreated
back
to
a
sofa
where
she
seated
herself
,
leaving
him
still
standing
in
the
space
before
the
fire
.
<EOS>
"
That
you
may
do
much
for
yourself
is
my
greatest
hope
.
<EOS>
If
I
can
help
you
,
I
will
do
so
most
heartily
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Then
she
became
thoroughly
ashamed
of
her
words
,
feeling
that
she
was
at
once
offering
to
him
the
use
of
her
purse
.
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
you
will
help
me
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
full
of
plans
,
all
of
which
you
must
share
with
me
.
<EOS>
But
now
,
at
this
moment
,
my
one
great
plan
is
that
in
which
you
have
already
consented
to
be
my
partner
.
<EOS>
Alice
,
you
are
my
wife
now
.
<EOS>
Tell
me
that
it
will
make
you
happy
to
call
me
your
husband
.
"
  
<EOS>
Not
for
worlds
could
she
have
said
so
at
this
moment
.
<EOS>
It
was
ill
-
judged
in
him
to
press
her
thus
.
<EOS>
He
should
already
have
seen
,
with
half
an
eye
,
that
no
such
triumph
as
that
which
he
now
demanded
could
be
his
on
this
occasion
.
<EOS>
He
had
had
his
triumph
when
,
in
the
solitude
of
his
own
room
,
with
quiet
sarcasm
he
had
thrown
on
one
side
of
him
the
letter
in
which
she
had
accepted
him
,
as
though
the
matter
had
been
one
almost
indifferent
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
had
no
right
to
expect
the
double
triumph
.
<EOS>
Then
he
had
frankly
told
himself
that
her
money
would
be
useful
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
should
have
been
contented
with
that
conviction
,
and
not
have
required
her
also
to
speak
to
him
soft
winning
words
of
love
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
must
be
still
distant
,
George
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
suffered
so
much
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
it
has
been
my
fault
that
you
have
suffered
;
I
know
that
.
<EOS>
These
years
of
misery
have
been
my
doing
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
,
however
,
the
year
of
coming
misery
that
was
the
most
to
be
dreaded
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
say
that
,
"
she
replied
,
"
nor
have
I
ever
thought
it
.
<EOS>
I
have
myself
and
myself
only
to
blame
.
<EOS>
"
Here
he
altogether
misunderstood
her
,
believing
her
to
mean
that
the
fault
for
which
she
blamed
herself
had
been
committed
in
separating
herself
from
him
on
that
former
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
"
Alice
,
dear
,
let
bygones
be
bygones
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Bygones
will
not
be
bygones
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
well
for
people
to
say
so
,
but
it
is
never
true
.
<EOS>
One
might
as
well
say
so
to
one
's
body
as
to
one
's
heart
.
<EOS>
But
the
hairs
will
grow
grey
,
and
the
heart
will
grow
cold
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
see
that
one
follows
upon
the
other
,
"
said
George
.
<EOS>
"
My
hair
is
growing
very
grey
;
"
 
and
to
show
that
it
was
so
,
he
lifted
the
dark
lock
from
the
side
of
his
forehead
,
and
displayed
the
incipient
grizzling
of
the
hair
from
behind
.
<EOS>
"
If
grey
hairs
make
an
old
man
,
Alice
,
you
will
marry
an
old
husband
;
but
even
you
shall
not
be
allowed
to
say
that
my
heart
is
old
.
"
  
<EOS>
That
word
"
husband
,
"
which
her
cousin
had
twice
used
,
was
painful
to
Alice
's
ear
.
<EOS>
She
shrunk
from
it
with
palpable
bodily
suffering
.
<EOS>
Marry
an
old
husband
!
<EOS>
His
age
was
nothing
to
the
purpose
,
though
he
had
been
as
old
as
Enoch
.
<EOS>
But
she
was
again
obliged
to
answer
him
.
<EOS>
"
I
spoke
of
my
own
heart
,
"
said
she
:
"
<EOS>
I
sometimes
feel
that
it
has
grown
very
old
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Alice
,
that
is
hardly
cheering
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
come
to
me
too
quickly
,
George
,
and
do
not
reflect
how
much
there
is
that
I
must
remember
.
<EOS>
You
have
said
that
bygones
should
be
bygones
.
<EOS>
Let
them
be
so
,
at
any
rate
as
far
as
words
are
concerned
.
<EOS>
Give
me
a
few
months
in
which
I
may
learn
,
 
not
to
forget
them
,
for
that
will
be
impossible
,
 
but
to
abstain
from
speaking
of
them
.
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
something
in
her
look
as
she
spoke
,
and
in
the
tone
of
her
voice
that
was
very
sad
.
<EOS>
It
struck
him
forcibly
,
but
it
struck
him
with
anger
rather
than
with
sadness
.
<EOS>
Doubtless
her
money
had
been
his
chief
object
when
he
offered
to
renew
his
engagement
with
her
.
<EOS>
Doubtless
he
would
have
made
no
such
offer
<EOS>
had
she
been
penniless
,
or
even
had
his
own
need
been
less
pressing
.
<EOS>
But
,
nevertheless
,
he
desired
something
more
than
money
.
<EOS>
The
triumph
of
being
preferred
to
John
Grey
,
 
of
having
John
Grey
sent
altogether
adrift
,
in
order
that
his
old
love
might
be
recovered
,
would
have
been
too
costly
a
luxury
for
him
to
seek
,
had
he
not
in
seeking
it
been
able
to
combine
prudence
with
the
luxury
.
<EOS>
But
though
his
prudence
had
been
undoubted
,
he
desired
the
luxury
also
.
<EOS>
It
was
on
a
calculation
of
the
combined
advantage
that
he
had
made
his
second
offer
to
his
cousin
.
<EOS>
As
he
would
by
no
means
have
consented
to
proceed
with
the
arrangement
without
the
benefit
of
his
cousin
's
money
,
so
also
did
he
feel
unwilling
to
dispense
with
some
expression
of
her
love
for
him
,
which
would
be
to
him
triumphant
.
<EOS>
Hitherto
in
their
present
interview
<EOS>
there
had
certainly
been
no
expression
of
her
love
.
  
<EOS>
"
Alice
,
"
he
said
,
"
your
greeting
to
me
is
hardly
all
that
I
had
hoped
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
it
not
?
"
said
she
.
"
<EOS>
Indeed
,
George
,
I
am
sorry
that
you
should
be
disappointed
;
but
what
can
I
say
?
<EOS>
You
would
not
have
me
affect
a
lightness
of
spirit
which
I
do
not
feel
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
wish
,
"
said
he
,
very
slowly
,
 
<EOS>
"
if
you
wish
to
retract
your
letter
to
me
,
you
now
have
my
leave
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
What
an
opportunity
was
this
of
escape
!
<EOS>
But
she
had
not
the
courage
to
accept
it
.
<EOS>
What
girl
,
under
such
circumstances
,
would
have
had
such
courage
?
<EOS>
How
often
are
offers
made
to
us
which
we
would
almost
give
our
eyes
to
accept
,
but
dare
not
accept
because
we
fear
the
countenance
of
the
offerer
?
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
wish
to
retract
my
letter
,
"
said
she
,
speaking
as
slowly
as
he
had
spoken
;
"
but
I
wish
to
be
left
awhile
,
that
I
may
recover
my
strength
of
mind
.
<EOS>
Have
you
not
heard
doctors
say
,
that
muscles
which
have
been
strained
,
should
be
allowed
rest
,
or
they
will
never
entirely
renew
their
tension
?
<EOS>
It
is
so
with
me
now
;
if
I
could
be
quiet
for
a
few
months
,
I
think
I
could
learn
to
face
the
future
with
a
better
courage
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
is
that
all
you
can
say
to
me
,
Alice
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
would
you
have
me
say
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
would
fain
hear
one
word
of
love
from
you
;
is
that
unreasonable
?
<EOS>
I
would
wish
to
know
from
your
own
lips
that
you
have
satisfaction
in
the
renewed
prospect
of
our
union
;
is
that
too
ambitious
?
<EOS>
It
might
have
been
that
I
was
over
-
bold
in
pressing
my
suit
upon
you
again
;
but
as
you
accepted
it
,
have
I
not
a
right
to
expect
that
you
should
show
me
that
you
have
been
happy
in
accepting
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
But
she
had
not
been
happy
in
accepting
it
.
<EOS>
She
was
not
happy
now
that
she
had
accepted
it
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
show
to
him
any
sign
of
such
joy
as
that
which
he
desired
to
see
.
<EOS>
And
now
,
at
this
moment
,
she
feared
with
an
excessive
fear
that
there
would
come
some
demand
for
an
outward
demonstration
of
love
,
such
as
he
in
his
position
might
have
a
right
to
make
.
<EOS>
She
seemed
to
be
aware
that
this
might
be
prevented
only
by
such
demeanour
on
her
part
as
that
which
she
had
practised
,
and
she
could
not
,
therefore
,
be
stirred
to
the
expression
of
any
word
of
affection
.
<EOS>
She
listened
to
his
appeal
,
and
when
it
was
finished
she
made
no
reply
.
<EOS>
If
he
chose
to
take
her
in
dudgeon
,
he
must
do
so
.
<EOS>
She
would
make
for
him
any
sacrifice
that
was
possible
to
her
,
but
this
sacrifice
was
not
possible
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
have
not
a
word
to
say
to
me
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
.
<EOS>
She
looked
up
at
him
,
and
saw
that
the
cicature
on
his
face
was
becoming
ominous
;
his
eyes
were
bent
upon
her
with
all
their
forbidding
brilliance
,
and
he
was
assuming
that
look
of
angry
audacity
which
was
so
peculiar
to
him
,
and
which
had
so
often
cowed
those
with
whom
he
was
brought
in
contact
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
other
word
,
at
present
,
George
;
I
have
told
you
that
I
am
not
at
ease
.
<EOS>
Why
do
you
press
me
now
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
had
her
letter
to
him
in
the
breast
-
pocket
of
his
coat
,
and
his
hand
was
on
it
,
that
he
might
fling
it
back
to
her
,
and
tell
her
that
he
would
not
hold
her
to
be
his
promised
wife
under
such
circumstances
as
these
.
<EOS>
The
anger
which
would
have
induced
him
to
do
so
was
the
better
part
of
his
nature
.
<EOS>
Three
or
four
years
since
,
this
better
part
would
have
prevailed
,
and
he
would
have
given
way
to
his
rage
.
<EOS>
But
now
,
as
his
fingers
played
upon
the
paper
,
he
remembered
that
her
money
was
absolutely
essential
to
him
,
 
that
some
of
it
was
needed
by
him
almost
instantly
,
 
that
on
this
very
morning
he
was
bound
to
go
where
money
would
be
demanded
from
him
,
and
that
his
hopes
with
regard
to
Chelsea
could
not
be
maintained
unless
he
was
able
to
make
some
substantial
promise
of
providing
funds
.
<EOS>
His
sister
Kate
's
fortune
was
just
two
thousand
pounds
.
<EOS>
That
,
and
no
more
,
was
now
the
capital
at
his
command
,
if
he
should
abandon
this
other
source
of
aid
.
<EOS>
Even
that
must
go
,
if
all
other
sources
should
fail
him
;
but
he
would
fain
have
that
untouched
,
if
it
were
possible
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
that
that
old
man
in
Westmoreland
would
die
and
be
gathered
to
his
fathers
,
now
that
he
was
full
of
years
and
ripe
for
the
sickle
!
<EOS>
But
there
was
no
sign
of
death
about
the
old
man
.
<EOS>
So
his
fingers
released
their
hold
on
the
letter
,
and
he
stood
looking
at
her
in
his
anger
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
wish
me
then
to
go
from
you
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
not
be
angry
with
me
,
George
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Angry
!
<EOS>
I
have
no
right
to
be
angry
.
<EOS>
But
,
by
heaven
,
I
am
wrong
there
.
<EOS>
I
have
the
right
,
and
I
am
angry
.
<EOS>
I
think
you
owed
it
me
to
give
me
some
warmer
welcome
.
<EOS>
Is
it
to
be
thus
with
us
always
for
the
next
accursed
year
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Oh
,
George
!
"
  
"
To
me
it
will
be
accursed
.
<EOS>
But
is
it
to
be
thus
between
us
always
?
<EOS>
Alice
,
I
have
loved
you
above
all
women
.
<EOS>
I
may
say
that
I
have
never
loved
any
woman
but
you
;
and
yet
I
am
sometimes
driven
to
doubt
whether
you
have
a
heart
in
you
capable
of
love
.
<EOS>
After
all
that
has
passed
,
all
your
old
protestations
,
all
my
repentance
,
and
your
proffer
of
forgiveness
,
you
should
have
received
me
with
open
arms
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
I
may
go
now
,
and
feel
that
I
have
been
kicked
out
of
your
house
like
a
dog
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
speak
to
me
like
that
,
and
look
at
me
like
that
,
how
can
I
answer
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
want
no
answer
.
<EOS>
I
wanted
you
to
put
your
hand
in
mine
,
to
kiss
me
,
and
to
tell
me
that
you
are
once
more
my
own
.
<EOS>
Alice
,
think
better
of
it
;
kiss
me
,
and
let
me
feel
my
arm
once
more
round
your
waist
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
shuddered
as
she
sat
,
still
silent
,
on
her
seat
,
and
he
saw
that
she
shuddered
.
<EOS>
With
all
his
desire
for
her
money
,
 
his
instant
need
of
it
,
 
this
was
too
much
for
him
;
and
he
turned
upon
his
heel
,
and
left
the
room
without
another
word
.
<EOS>
She
heard
his
quick
step
as
he
hurried
down
the
stairs
,
but
she
did
not
rise
to
arrest
him
.
<EOS>
She
heard
the
door
slam
as
he
left
the
house
,
but
still
she
did
not
move
from
her
seat
.
<EOS>
Her
immediate
desire
had
been
that
he
should
go
,
 
and
now
he
was
gone
.
<EOS>
There
was
in
that
a
relief
which
almost
comforted
her
.
<EOS>
And
this
was
the
man
from
whom
,
within
the
last
few
days
,
she
had
accepted
an

George
,
when
he
left
the
house
,
walked
hurriedly
into
Cavendish
Square
,
and
down
along
the
east
side
,
till
he
made
his
way
out
along
Princes
Street
,
into
the
Circus
in
Oxford
Street
.
<EOS>
Close
to
him
there
,
in
Great
Marlborough
Street
,
was
the
house
of
his
parliamentary
attorney
,
Mr.
Scruby
,
on
whom
he
was
bound
to
call
on
that
morning
.
<EOS>
As
he
had
walked
away
from
Queen
Anne
Street
,
he
had
thought
of
nothing
but
that
too
visible
shudder
which
his
cousin
Alice
had
been
unable
to
repress
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
feeding
on
his
anger
,
and
indulging
it
,
telling
himself
at
one
moment
that
he
would
let
her
and
her
money
go
from
him
whither
they
list
,
 
and
making
inward
threats
in
the
next
that
the
time
should
come
in
which
he
would
punish
her
for
this
ill
-
usage
.
<EOS>
But
there
was
the
necessity
of
resolving
what
he
would
say
to
Mr.
Scruby
.
<EOS>
To
Mr.
Scruby
was
still
due
some
trifle
on
the
cost
of
the
last
election
;
but
even
if
this
were
paid
,
Mr.
Scruby
would
make
no
heavy
advance
towards
the
expense
of
the
next
election
.
<EOS>
Whoever
might
come
out
at
the
end
of
such
affairs
without
a
satisfactory
settlement
of
his
little
bill
,
as
had
for
a
while
been
the
case
with
Mr.
Grimes
,
from
the
"
Handsome
Man
,
"
 
and
as
,
indeed
,
still
was
the
case
with
him
,
as
that
note
of
hand
at
three
months
<EOS>
"
date
was
not
yet
paid
,
 
Mr.
Scruby
seldom
allowed
himself
to
suffer
.
<EOS>
It
was
true
that
the
election
would
not
take
place
till
the
summer
;
but
there
were
preliminary
expenses
which
needed
ready
money
.
<EOS>
Metropolitan
voters
,
as
Mr.
Scruby
often
declared
,
required
to
be
kept
in
good
humour
,
 
so
that
Mr.
Scruby
wanted
the
present
payment
of
some
five
hundred
pounds
,
and
a
well
-
grounded
assurance
that
he
would
be
put
in
full
funds
by
the
beginning
of
next
June
.
<EOS>
Even
Mr.
Scruby
might
not
be
true
as
perfect
steel
,
if
he
thought
that
his
candidate
at
the
last
moment
would
not
come
forth
properly
prepared
.
<EOS>
Other
candidates
,
with
money
in
their
pockets
,
might
find
their
way
into
Mr.
Scruby
's
offices
.
<EOS>
As
George
Vavasor
crossed
Regent
Street
,
he
gulped
down
his
anger
,
and
applied
his
mind
to
business
.
<EOS>
Should
he
prepare
himself
to
give
orders
that
Kate
's
little
property
should
be
sold
out
,
or
would
he
resolve
to
use
his
cousin
's
money
?
<EOS>
That
his
cousin
's
money
would
still
be
at
his
disposal
,
in
spite
of
the
stormy
mood
in
which
he
had
retreated
from
her
presence
,
he
felt
sure
;
but
the
asking
for
it
on
his
part
would
be
unpleasant
.
<EOS>
That
duty
he
must
entrust
to
Kate
.
<EOS>
But
as
he
reached
Mr.
Scruby
's
door
,
he
had
decided
that
for
such
purposes
as
those
now
in
hand
,
it
was
preferable
that
he
should
use
his
wife
's
fortune
.
<EOS>
It
was
thus
that
in
his
own
mind
he
worded
the
phrase
,
and
made
for
himself
an
excuse
.
<EOS>
Yes
;
 
he
would
use
his
wife
's
fortune
,
and
explain
to
Mr.
Scruby
that
he
would
be
justified
in
doing
so
by
the
fact
that
his
own
heritage
would
be
settled
on
her
at
her
marriage
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
suppose
that
he
altogether
liked
it
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
,
at
any
rate
as
yet
,
an
altogether
heartless
swindler
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
take
his
cousin
's
money
without
meaning
,
 
without
thinking
that
he
meant
,
to
repay
her
in
full
all
that
he
took
.
<EOS>
Her
behaviour
to
him
this
very
morning
had
no
doubt
made
the
affair
more
difficult
to
his
mind
,
and
more
unpleasant
than
it
would
have
been
had
she
smiled
on
him
;
but
even
as
it
was
,
he
managed
to
assure
himself
that
he
was
doing
her
no
wrong
,
and
with
this
self
-
assurance
he
entered
Mr.
Scruby
's
office
.
  
<EOS>
The
clerks
in
the
outer
office
were
very
civil
to
him
,
and
undertook
to
promise
him
that
he
should
not
be
kept
waiting
an
instant
.
<EOS>
There
were
four
gentlemen
in
the
little
parlour
,
they
said
,
waiting
to
see
Mr.
Scruby
,
but
there
they
should
remain
till
Mr.
Vavasor
's
interview
was
over
.
<EOS>
One
gentleman
,
as
it
seemed
,
was
even
turned
out
to
make
way
for
him
;
for
as
George
was
ushered
into
the
lawyer
's
room
,
a
little
man
,
looking
very
meek
,
was
hurried
away
from
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
can
wait
,
Smithers
,
"
said
Mr.
Scruby
,
speaking
from
within
.
<EOS>
"
I
sha
n't
be
very
long
.
"
Vavasor
apologized
to
his
agent
for
the
injury
he
was
doing
Smithers
;
but
Mr.
Scruby
explained
that
he
was
only
a
poor
devil
of
a
printer
,
looking
for
payment
of
his
little
account
.
<EOS>
He
had
printed
and
posted
30,000
placards
for
one
of
the
late
Marylebone
candidates
,
and
found
some
difficulty
in
getting
his
money
.
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
when
they
're
in
a
small
way
of
business
,
it
ruins
them
,
"
said
Scruby
.
<EOS>
"
Now
that
poor
devil
,
 
he
has
n't
had
a
shilling
of
his
money
yet
,
and
the
greater
part
has
been
paid
out
of
his
pocket
to
the
posters
.
<EOS>
It
is
hard
.
"
  
<EOS>
It
comforted
Vavasor
when
he
thus
heard
that
there
were
others
who
were
more
backward
in
their
payments
,
even
than
himself
,
and
made
him
reflect
that
a
longer
credit
than
had
yet
been
achieved
by
him
,
might
perhaps
be
within
his
reach
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
astonishing
how
much
a
man
may
get
done
for
him
,
"
said
he
,
"
without
paying
anything
for
years
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
that
's
true
.
<EOS>
So
he
may
,
if
he
knows
how
to
go
about
it
.
<EOS>
But
when
he
does
pay
,
Mr.
Vavasor
,
he
does
it
through
the
nose
;
 
cent
.
<EOS>
per
cent
.
<EOS>
,
and
worse
,
for
all
his
former
shortcomings
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
many
there
are
who
never
pay
at
all
,
"
said
George
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Mr.
Vavasor
;
 
that
's
true
,
too
.
<EOS>
But
see
what
a
life
they
lead
.
<EOS>
It
is
n't
a
pleasant
thing
to
be
afraid
of
coming
into
your
agent
's
office
;
not
what
you
would
like
,
Mr.
Vavasor
;
 
not
if
I
know
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
was
afraid
of
meeting
anyone
yet
,
"
said
Vavasor
;
"
but
I
do
n't
know
what
I
may
come
to
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nor
never
will
,
I
'll
go
bail
.
<EOS>
But
,
Lord
love
you
,
I
could
tell
you
such
tales
!
<EOS>
I
've
had
Members
of
Parliament
,
past
,
present
,
and
future
,
almost
down
on
their
knees
to
me
in
this
little
room
.
<EOS>
It
's
about
a
month
or
six
weeks
before
the
elections
come
on
when
they
're
at
their
worst
.
<EOS>
There
is
so
much
you
see
,
Mr.
Vavasor
,
for
which
a
gentleman
must
pay
ready
money
.
<EOS>
It
is
n't
like
a
business
in
which
a
lawyer
is
supposed
to
find
the
capital
.
<EOS>
If
I
had
money
enough
to
pay
out
of
my
own
pocket
all
the
cost
of
all
the
metropolitan
gentlemen
for
whom
I
act
,
why
,
I
could
live
on
the
interest
without
any
trouble
,
and
go
into
Parliament
myself
like
a
man
.
"
  
<EOS>
George
Vavasor
perfectly
understood
that
Mr.
Scruby
was
explaining
to
him
,
with
what
best
attempt
at
delicacy
he
could
make
,
that
funds
for
the
expense
of
the
Chelsea
election
were
not
to
be
forthcoming
from
the
Great
Marlborough
Street
establishment
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
so
,
"
said
he
.
<EOS>
"
But
you
do
do
it
sometimes
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Never
,
Mr.
Vavasor
,
"
said
Mr.
Scruby
,
very
solemnly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
a
rule
,
never
.
<EOS>
I
may
advance
the
money
,
on
interest
,
of
course
,
when
I
receive
a
guarantee
from
the
candidate
's
father
,
or
from
six
or
seven
among
the
committee
,
who
must
all
be
very
substantial
,
 
very
substantial
indeed
.
<EOS>
But
in
a
general
way
I
do
n't
do
it
.
<EOS>
It
is
n't
my
place
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
thought
you
did
;
 
but
at
any
rate
I
do
n't
want
you
to
do
it
for
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
quite
sure
you
do
n't
,
"
said
Mr.
Scruby
,
with
a
brighter
tone
of
voice
than
that
he
had
just
been
using
.
<EOS>
"
I
never
thought
you
did
,
Mr.
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
Lord
bless
you
,
Mr.
Vavasor
<EOS>
,
I
know
the
difference
between
gentlemen
as
soon
as
I
see
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Then
they
went
to
business
,
and
Vavasor
became
aware
that
it
would
be
thought
convenient
that
he
should
lodge
with
Mr.
Scruby
,
to
his
own
account
,
a
sum
not
less
than
six
hundred
pounds
within
the
next
week
,
and
it
would
be
also
necessary
that
he
should
provide
for
taking
up
that
bill
,
amounting
to
ninety
-
two
pounds
,
which
he
had
given
to
the
landlord
of
the
"
Handsome
Man
.
<EOS>
"
In
short
,
it
would
be
well
that
he
should
borrow
a
thousand
pounds
from
Alice
,
and
as
he
did
not
wish
that
the
family
attorney
of
the
Vavasors
should
be
employed
to
raise
it
,
he
communicated
to
Mr.
Scruby
as
much
of
his
plans
as
was
necessary
,
 
feeling
more
hesitation
in
doing
it
than
might
have
been
expected
from
him
.
<EOS>
When
he
had
done
so
,
he
was
very
intent
on
explaining
also
that
the
money
taken
from
his
cousin
,
and
future
bride
,
would
be
repaid
to
her
out
of
the
property
in
Westmoreland
,
which
was
,
 
<EOS>
did
he
say
settled
on
himself
?
<EOS>
I
am
afraid
he
did
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
yes
;
 
a
family
arrangement
,
"
said
Mr.
Scruby
,
as
he
congratulated
him
on
his
proposed
marriage
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Scruby
did
not
care
a
straw
from
what
source
the
necessary
funds
might
be
drawn
.
   
<EOS>
John
Grey
Goes
a
Second
Time
to
London
.
 
<EOS>
Early
in
that
conversation
which
Mr.
Vavasor
had
with
his
daughter
,
and
which
was
recorded
a
few
pages
back
,
he
implored
her
to
pause
a
while
before
she
informed
Mr.
Grey
of
her
engagement
with
her
cousin
.
<EOS>
Nothing
,
however
,
on
that
point
had
been
settled
between
them
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Vavasor
had
wished
her
to
say
that
she
would
not
write
till
he
should
have
assented
to
her
doing
so
.
<EOS>
She
had
declined
to
bind
herself
in
this
way
,
and
then
they
had
gone
off
to
other
things
;
 
to
George
Vavasor
's
character
and
the
disposition
of
her
money
.
<EOS>
Alice
,
however
,
had
felt
herself
bound
not
to
write
to
Mr.
Grey
quite
at
once
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
when
her
cousin
left
her
she
had
no
appetite
for
writing
such
a
letter
as
hers
was
to
be
.
<EOS>
A
day
or
two
passed
by
her
in
this
way
,
and
nothing
more
was
said
by
her
or
her
father
.
<EOS>
It
was
now
the
middle
of
January
,
and
the
reader
may
remember
that
Mr.
Grey
had
promised
that
he
would
come
to
her
in
London
in
that
month
,
as
soon
as
he
should
know
that
she
had
returned
from
Westmoreland
.
<EOS>
She
must
at
any
rate
do
something
to
prevent
that
visit
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Grey
would
not
come
without
giving
her
notice
.
<EOS>
She
knew
enough
of
the
habits
of
the
man
to
be
sure
of
that
.
<EOS>
But
she
desired
that
her
letter
to
him
should
be
in
time
to
prevent
his
to
her
;
so
when
those
few
days
were
gone
,
she
sat
down
to
write
without
speaking
to
her
father
again
upon
the
subject
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
terrible
job
;
 
perhaps
the
most
difficult
of
all
the
difficult
tasks
which
her
adverse
fate
had
imposed
upon
her
.
<EOS>
She
found
when
she
did
attempt
it
,
that
she
could
have
done
it
better
if
she
had
done
it
at
the
moment
when
she
was
writing
the
other
letter
to
her
cousin
George
.
<EOS>
Then
Kate
had
been
near
her
,
and
she
had
been
comforted
by
Kate
's
affectionate
happiness
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
strengthened
at
that
moment
by
a
feeling
that
she
was
doing
the
best
in
her
power
,
if
not
for
herself
,
at
any
rate
for
others
.
<EOS>
All
that
comfort
and
all
that
strength
had
left
her
now
.
<EOS>
The
atmosphere
of
the
fells
had
buoyed
her
up
,
and
now
the
thick
air
of
London
depressed
her
.
<EOS>
She
sat
for
hours
with
the
pen
in
her
hand
,
and
could
not
write
the
letter
.
<EOS>
She
let
a
day
go
by
and
a
night
,
and
still
it
was
not
written
.
<EOS>
She
hardly
knew
herself
in
her
unnatural
weakness
.
<EOS>
As
the
mental
photographs
of
the
two
men
forced
themselves
upon
her
,
she
could
not
force
herself
to
forget
those
words
 
<EOS>
"
Look
here
,
upon
this
picture
 
and
on
this
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
How
was
it
that
she
now
knew
how
great
was
the
difference
between
the
two
men
,
<EOS>
how
immense
the
pre
-
eminence
of
him
whom
she
had
rejected
;
 
and
that
she
had
not
before
been
able
to
see
this
on
any
of
those
many
previous
occasions
on
which
she
had
compared
the
two
together
?
<EOS>
As
she
thought
of
her
cousin
<EOS>
George
's
face
when
he
left
her
room
a
few
days
since
,
and
remembered
Mr.
Grey
's
countenance
when
last
he
held
her
hand
at
Cheltenham
,
the
quiet
dignity
of
his
beauty
which
would
submit
to
show
no
consciousness
of
injury
<EOS>
,
she
could
not
but
tell
herself
that
when
Paradise
had
been
opened
to
her
,
she
had
declared
herself
to
be
fit
only
for
Pandemonium
.
<EOS>
In
that
was
her
chief
misery
;
that
now
,
 
now
when
it
was
too
late
,
 
she
could
look
at
it
aright
.
  
<EOS>
But
the
letter
must
be
written
,
and
on
the
second
day
she
declared
to
herself
that
she
would
not
rise
from
her
chair
till
it
was
done
.
<EOS>
The
letter
was
written
on
that
day
and
was
posted
.
<EOS>
I
will
now
ask
the
reader
to
go
down
with
me
to
Nethercoats
that
we
may
be
present
with
John
Grey
when
he
received
it
.
<EOS>
He
was
sitting
at
breakfast
in
his
study
there
,
and
opposite
to
him
,
lounging
in
an
arm
-
chair
,
with
a
_
Quarterly
_
<EOS>
in
his
hand
,
was
the
most
intimate
of
his
friends
,
Frank
Seward
,
a
fellow
of
the
college
to
which
they
had
both
belonged
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Seward
was
a
clergyman
,
and
the
tutor
of
his
college
,
and
a
man
who
worked
very
hard
at
Cambridge
.
<EOS>
In
the
days
of
his
leisure
he
spent
much
of
his
time
at
Nethercoats
,
and
he
was
the
only
man
to
whom
Grey
had
told
anything
of
his
love
for
Alice
and
of
his
disappointment
.
<EOS>
Even
to
Seward
he
had
not
told
the
whole
story
.
<EOS>
He
had
at
first
informed
his
friend
that
he
was
engaged
to
be
married
,
and
as
he
had
told
this
as
no
secret
,
 
having
even
said
that
he
hated
secrets
on
such
matters
,
 
<EOS>
the
engagement
had
been
mentioned
in
the
common
room
of
their
college
,
and
men
at
Cambridge
knew
that
Mr.
Grey
was
going
to
take
to
himself
a
wife
.
<EOS>
Then
Mr.
Seward
had
been
told
that
trouble
had
come
,
and
that
it
was
not
improbable
that
there
would
be
no
such
marriage
.
<EOS>
Even
when
saying
this
Mr.
Grey
told
none
of
the
particulars
,
though
he
owned
to
his
friend
that
a
heavy
blow
had
struck
him
.
<EOS>
His
intimacy
with
Seward
was
of
that
thorough
kind
which
is
engendered
only
out
of
such
young
and
lasting
friendship
as
had
existed
between
them
;
but
even
to
such
a
friend
as
this
Mr.
Grey
could
not
open
his
whole
heart
.
<EOS>
It
was
only
to
a
friend
who
should
also
be
his
wife
that
he
could
do
that
,
 
as
he
himself
thoroughly
understood
.
<EOS>
He
had
felt
that
such
a
friend
was
wanting
to
him
,
and
he
had
made
the
attempt
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
speak
of
this
as
yet
,
"
he
had
said
to
Mr.
Seward
.
<EOS>
"
Of
course
when
the
matter
is
settled
,
those
few
people
who
know
me
must
know
it
.
<EOS>
But
perhaps
there
may
be
a
doubt
as
yet
,
and
as
long
as
there
is
a
doubt
,
it
is
better
that
it
should
not
be
discussed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
had
said
no
more
than
this
,
 
had
imputed
no
blame
to
Alice
,
 
had
told
none
of
the
circumstances
;
but
Seward
had
known
that
the
girl
had
jilted
his
friend
,
and
had
made
up
his
mind
that
she
must
be
heartless
and
false
.
<EOS>
He
had
known
also
that
his
friend
would
never
look
for
any
other
such
companion
for
his
home
.
  
<EOS>
Letters
were
brought
to
each
of
them
on
this
morning
,
and
Seward
's
attention
was
of
course
occupied
by
those
which
he
received
.
<EOS>
Grey
,
as
soon
as
the
envelopes
had
touched
his
hand
,
became
aware
that
one
of
them
was
from
Alice
,
and
this
he
at
once
opened
.
<EOS>
He
did
it
very
calmly
,
but
without
any
of
that
bravado
of
indifference
with
which
George
Vavasor
had
received
Alice
's
letter
from
Westmoreland
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
right
that
I
should
tell
you
at
once
,
"
said
Alice
,
rushing
into
the
middle
of
her
subject
without
even
the
formality
of
the
customary
address
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
right
that
I
should
tell
you
at
once
that
 
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
the
difficulty
which
she
had
encountered
when
her
words
had
carried
her
as
far
as
this
!
 
<EOS>
"
that
my
cousin
,
George
Vavasor
,
has
repeated
to
me
his
offer
of
marriage
,
and
that
I
have
accepted
it
.
<EOS>
I
tell
you
,
chiefly
in
order
that
I
may
save
you
from
the
trouble
which
you
purposed
to
take
when
I
last
saw
you
at
Cheltenham
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
tell
you
any
of
the
circumstances
of
this
engagement
,
because
I
have
no
right
to
presume
that
you
will
care
to
hear
them
.
<EOS>
I
hardly
dare
to
ask
you
to
believe
of
me
that
in
all
that
I
have
done
,
I
have
endeavoured
to
act
with
truth
and
honesty
.
<EOS>
That
I
have
been
very
ignorant
,
foolish
,
 
what
you
will
<EOS>
that
is
bad
,
<EOS>
I
know
well
;
otherwise
there
could
not
have
been
so
much
in
the
last
few
years
of
my
life
on
which
I
am
utterly
ashamed
to
look
back
.
<EOS>
For
the
injury
that
I
have
done
you
,
I
can
only
express
deep
contrition
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
dare
to
ask
you
to
forgive
me
.
 
<EOS>
ALICE
VAVASOR
.
<EOS>
"
She
had
tormented
herself
in
writing
this
,
 
had
so
nearly
driven
herself
distracted
with
attempts
which
she
had
destroyed
,
that
she
would
not
even
read
once
to
herself
these
last
words
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
'll
know
it
,
and
that
is
all
that
is
necessary
,
"
she
said
to
herself
as
she
sent
the
letter
away
from
her
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Grey
read
it
twice
over
,
leaving
the
other
letters
unnoticed
on
the
table
by
his
tea
-
cup
.
<EOS>
He
read
it
twice
over
,
and
the
work
of
reading
it
was
one
to
him
of
intense
agony
.
<EOS>
Hitherto
he
had
fed
himself
with
hope
.
<EOS>
That
Alice
should
have
been
brought
to
think
of
her
engagement
with
him
in
a
spirit
of
doubt
and
with
a
mind
<EOS>
so
troubled
,
that
she
had
been
inclined
to
attempt
an
escape
from
it
,
had
been
very
grievous
to
him
;
but
it
had
been
in
his
mind
a
fantasy
,
a
morbid
fear
of
himself
,
which
might
be
cured
by
time
.
<EOS>
He
,
at
any
rate
,
would
give
all
his
energies
towards
achieving
such
a
cure
.
<EOS>
There
had
been
one
thing
,
however
,
which
he
most
feared
;
 
which
he
had
chiefly
feared
,
though
he
had
forbidden
himself
to
think
that
it
could
be
probable
,
and
this
thing
had
now
happened
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
ever
disliked
and
feared
George
Vavasor
;
 
not
from
any
effect
which
the
man
had
upon
himself
,
for
as
we
know
his
acquaintance
with
Vavasor
was
of
the
slightest
;
 
but
he
had
feared
and
disliked
his
influence
upon
Alice
.
<EOS>
He
had
also
feared
the
influence
of
her
cousin
Kate
.
<EOS>
To
have
cautioned
Alice
against
her
cousins
would
have
been
to
him
impossible
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
his
nature
to
express
suspicion
to
one
he
loved
.
<EOS>
Is
the
tone
of
that
letter
remembered
in
which
he
had
answered
Alice
when
she
informed
him
that
her
cousin
George
was
to
go
with
Kate
and
her
to
Switzerland
?
<EOS>
He
had
written
,
with
a
pleasant
joke
,
words
which
Alice
had
been
able
to
read
with
some
little
feeling
of
triumph
to
her
two
friends
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
so
written
because
he
liked
what
he
knew
of
the
man
.
<EOS>
He
disliked
all
that
he
knew
of
him
.
<EOS>
But
it
had
not
been
possible
for
him
to
show
that
he
distrusted
the
prudence
of
her
,
whom
,
as
his
future
wife
,
he
was
prepared
to
trust
in
all
things
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
said
that
he
read
Alice
's
letter
with
an
agony
of
sorrow
<EOS>
;
as
he
sat
with
it
in
his
hand
he
suffered
as
,
probably
,
he
had
never
suffered
before
.
<EOS>
But
there
was
nothing
in
his
countenance
to
show
that
he
was
in
pain
.
<EOS>
Seward
had
received
some
long
epistle
,
crossed
from
end
to
end
,
 
indicative
,
I
should
say
,
of
a
not
far
distant
termination
to
that
college
tutorship
,
 
and
was
reading
it
with
placid
contentment
.
<EOS>
It
did
not
occur
to
him
to
look
across
at
Grey
,
but
had
he
done
so
,
I
doubt
whether
he
would
have
seen
anything
to
attract
his
attention
.
<EOS>
But
Grey
,
though
he
was
wounded
,
would
not
allow
himself
to
be
dismayed
.
<EOS>
There
was
less
hope
now
than
before
,
but
there
might
still
be
hope
;
 
hope
for
her
,
even
though
there
might
be
none
for
him
.
<EOS>
Tidings
had
reached
his
ears
also
as
to
George
Vavasor
,
which
had
taught
him
to
believe
that
the
man
was
needy
,
reckless
,
and
on
the
brink
of
ruin
.
<EOS>
Such
a
marriage
to
Alice
Vavasor
would
be
altogether
ruinous
.
<EOS>
Whatever
might
be
his
own
ultimate
fate
he
would
still
seek
to
save
her
from
that
.
<EOS>
Her
cousin
,
doubtless
,
wanted
her
money
.
<EOS>
Might
it
not
be
possible
that
he
would
be
satisfied
with
her
money
,
and
that
thus
the
woman
might
be
saved
?
  
<EOS>
"
Seward
,
"
he
said
at
last
,
addressing
his
friend
,
who
had
not
yet
come
to
the
end
of
the
last
crossed
page
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
there
anything
wrong
?
"
said
Seward
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
;
 
yes
;
there
is
something
a
little
wrong
.
<EOS>
I
fear
I
must
leave
you
,
and
go
up
to
town
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nobody
ill
,
I
hope
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
 
nobody
is
ill
.
<EOS>
But
I
must
go
up
to
London
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bole
will
take
care
of
you
,
and
you
must
not
be
angry
with
me
for
leaving
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Seward
assured
him
that
he
would
not
be
in
the
least
angry
,
and
that
he
was
thoroughly
conversant
with
the
capabilities
and
good
intentions
of
Mrs.
Bole
the
housekeeper
;
but
added
,
that
as
he
was
so
near
his
own
college
,
he
would
of
course
go
back
to
Cambridge
.
<EOS>
He
longed
to
say
some
word
as
to
the
purpose
of
Grey
's
threatened
journey
;
to
make
some
inquiry
as
to
this
new
trouble
;
but
he
knew
that
Grey
was
a
man
who
did
not
well
bear
close
inquiries
,
and
he
was
silent
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
not
stay
here
?
"
said
Grey
,
after
a
minute
's
pause
.
<EOS>
"
I
wish
you
would
,
old
fellow
;
I
do
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
There
was
a
tone
of
special
affection
in
his
voice
which
struck
Seward
at
once
.
<EOS>
"
If
I
can
be
of
the
slightest
service
or
comfort
to
you
,
I
will
of
course
.
"
  
<EOS>
Grey
again
sat
silent
for
a
little
while
.
<EOS>
"
I
wish
you
would
;
I
do
,
indeed
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
I
will
.
"
<EOS>
And
again
there
was
a
pause
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
got
a
letter
here
from
 
Miss
Vavasor
,
"
said
Grey
.
  
<EOS>
"
May
I
hope
that
 
"
  
"
No
;
 
it
does
not
bring
good
news
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
that
I
can
tell
it
you
all
.
<EOS>
I
would
if
I
could
,
but
the
whole
story
is
one
not
to
be
told
in
a
hurry
.
<EOS>
I
should
leave
false
impressions
.
<EOS>
There
are
things
which
a
man
can
not
tell
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
there
are
,
"
said
Seward
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
with
all
my
heart
that
you
knew
it
all
as
I
know
it
;
but
that
is
impossible
.
<EOS>
There
are
things
which
happen
in
a
day
which
it
would
take
a
lifetime
to
explain
.
<EOS>
"
Then
there
was
another
pause
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
heard
bad
news
this
morning
,
and
I
must
go
up
to
London
at
once
.
<EOS>
I
shall
go
into
Ely
so
as
to
be
there
by
twelve
;
and
if
you
will
,
you
shall
drive
me
over
.
<EOS>
I
may
be
back
in
a
day
;
certainly
in
less
than
a
week
;
but
it
will
be
a
comfort
to
me
to
know
that
I
shall
find
you
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
matter
was
so
arranged
,
and
at
eleven
they
started
.
<EOS>
During
the
first
two
miles
not
a
word
was
spoken
between
them
.
"
<EOS>
Seward
,
"
Grey
said
at
last
,
"
if
I
fail
in
what
I
am
going
to
attempt
,
it
is
probable
that
you
will
never
hear
Alice
Vavasor
's
name
mentioned
by
me
again
;
but
I
want
you
always
to
bear
this
in
mind
;
 
that
at
no
moment
has
my
opinion
of
her
ever
been
changed
,
nor
must
you
in
such
case
imagine
from
my
silence
that
it
has
changed
.
<EOS>
Do
you
understand
me
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
To
my
thinking
she
is
the
finest
of
God
's
creatures
that
I
have
known
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
that
in
her
future
life
she
will
be
severed
from
me
altogether
;
but
I
shall
not
,
therefore
,
think
the
less
well
of
her
;
and
I
wish
that
you
,
as
my
friend
,
should
know
that
I
so
esteem
her
,
even
though
her
name
should
never
be
mentioned
between
us
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Seward
,
in
some
few
words
,
assured
him
that
it
should
be
so
,
and
then
they
finished
their
journey
in
silence
.
  
<EOS>
From
the
station
at
Ely
,
Grey
sent
a
message
by
the
wires
up
to
John
Vavasor
,
saying
that
he
would
call
on
him
that
afternoon
at
his
office
in
Chancery
Lane
.
<EOS>
The
chances
were
always
much
against
finding
Mr.
Vavasor
at
his
office
;
but
on
this
occasion
the
telegram
did
reach
him
there
,
and
he
remained
till
the
unaccustomed
hour
of
half
<EOS>
past
four
to
meet
the
man
who
was
to
have
been
his
son
-
in
-
law
.
  
<EOS>
"
Have
you
heard
from
her
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
as
soon
as
Grey
entered
the
dingy
little
room
,
not
in
Chancery
Lane
,
but
in
its
neighbourhood
,
which
was
allocated
to
him
for
his
signing
purposes
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
 
said
Grey
;
"
she
has
written
to
me
.
"
  
"
And
told
you
about
her
cousin
George
.
<EOS>
I
tried
to
hinder
her
from
writing
,
but
she
is
very
wilful
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
should
you
have
hindered
her
?
<EOS>
If
the
thing
was
to
be
told
,
it
is
better
that
it
should
be
done
at
once
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
hoped
that
there
might
be
an
escape
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
what
you
think
of
all
this
,
Grey
,
but
to
me
it
is
the
bitterest
misfortune
that
I
have
known
.
<EOS>
And
I
've
had
some
bitter
things
,
too
,
"
he
added
,
 
thinking
of
that
period
of
his
life
,
when
the
work
of
which
he
was
ashamed
was
first
ordained
as
his
future
task
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
the
escape
that
you
hoped
?
"
asked
Grey
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hardly
know
.
<EOS>
The
whole
thing
seems
to
me
to
be
so
mad
,
that
I
partly
trusted
that
she
would
see
the
madness
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
sure
whether
you
know
anything
of
my
nephew
George
?
"
asked
Mr.
Vavasor
.
  
<EOS>
"
Very
little
,
"
said
Grey
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
him
to
be
utterly
an
adventurer
,
 
a
man
without
means
and
without
principle
,
 
upon
the
whole
about
as
bad
a
man
as
you
may
meet
.
<EOS>
I
give
you
my
word
,
Grey
,
that
I
do
n't
think
I
know
a
worse
man
.
<EOS>
He
's
going
to
marry
her
for
her
money
;
then
he
will
beggar
her
,
after
that
he
'll
ill
-
treat
her
,
and
yet
what
can
I
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Prevent
the
marriage
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
how
,
my
dear
fellow
?
<EOS>
Prevent
it
!
<EOS>
It
's
all
very
well
to
say
that
,
and
it
's
the
very
thing
I
want
to
do
.
<EOS>
But
how
am
I
to
prevent
it
?
<EOS>
She
's
as
much
her
own
master
as
you
are
yours
.
<EOS>
She
can
give
him
every
shilling
of
her
fortune
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
How
am
I
to
prevent
her
from
marrying
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Let
her
give
him
every
shilling
of
her
fortune
to
-
morrow
,
"
said
Grey
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
is
she
to
do
then
?
"
asked
Mr.
Vavasor
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
 
then
,
 
then
,
 
then
let
her
come
to
me
,
"
said
John
Grey
;
and
as
he
spoke
there
was
the
fragment
of
a
tear
in
his
eye
,
and
the
hint
of
quiver
in
his
voice
.
  
<EOS>
Even
the
worldly
,
worn
-
out
,
unsympathetic
nature
of
John
Vavasor
was
struck
,
and
,
as
it
were
,
warmed
by
this
.
  
<EOS>
"
God
bless
you
;
God
bless
you
,
my
dear
fellow
.
<EOS>
I
heartily
wish
for
her
sake
that
I
could
look
forward
to
any
such
an
end
to
this
affair
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
why
not
look
forward
to
it
?
<EOS>
You
say
that
he
merely
wants
her
money
.
<EOS>
As
he
wants
it
let
him
have
it
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
Grey
,
you
do
not
know
Alice
;
you
do
not
understand
my
girl
.
<EOS>
When
she
had
lost
her
fortune
nothing
would
induce
her
to
become
your
wife
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Leave
that
to
follow
as
it
may
,
"
said
John
Grey
.
<EOS>
"
Our
first
object
must
be
to
sever
her
from
a
man
,
who
is
,
as
you
say
,
himself
on
the
verge
of
ruin
;
and
who
would
certainly
make
her
wretched
.
<EOS>
I
am
here
now
,
not
because
I
wish
her
to
be
my
own
wife
,
but
because
I
wish
that
she
should
not
become
the
wife
of
such
a
one
as
your
nephew
.
<EOS>
If
I
were
you
I
would
let
him
have
her
money
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
were
I
,
you
would
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
it
than
the
man
that
is
as
yet
unborn
.
<EOS>
I
know
that
she
will
give
him
her
money
because
she
has
said
so
;
but
I
have
no
power
as
to
her
giving
it
<EOS>
or
as
to
her
withholding
it
.
<EOS>
That
's
the
hardship
of
my
position
;
 
but
it
is
of
no
use
to
think
of
that
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
John
Grey
certainly
did
not
think
about
it
.
<EOS>
He
knew
well
that
Alice
was
independent
,
and
that
she
was
not
inclined
to
give
up
that
independence
to
anyone
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
expected
that
her
father
would
be
able
to
do
much
towards
hindering
his
daughter
from
becoming
the
wife
of
George
Vavasor
,
but
he
had
wished
that
he
himself
and
her
father
should
be
in
accord
in
their
views
,
and
he
found
that
this
was
so
.
<EOS>
When
he
left
Mr.
Vavasor
's
room
nothing
had
been
said
about
the
period
of
the
marriage
.
<EOS>
Grey
thought
it
improbable
that
Alice
would
find
herself
able
to
give
herself
in
marriage
to
her
cousin
immediately
,
 
so
soon
after
her
breach
with
him
;
but
as
to
this
he
had
no
assurance
,
and
he
determined
to
have
the
facts
from
her
own
lips
,
if
she
would
see
him
.
<EOS>
So
he
wrote
to
her
,
naming
a
day
on
which
he
would
call
upon
her
early
in
the
morning
;
and
having
received
from
her
no
prohibition
,
he
was
in
Queen
Anne
Street
at
the
hour
appointed
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
conceived
a
scheme
which
he
had
not
made
known
to
Mr.
Vavasor
,
and
as
to
the
practicability
of
which
he
had
much
doubt
;
but
which
,
nevertheless
,
he
was
resolved
to
try
if
he
should
find
the
attempt
possible
.
<EOS>
He
himself
would
buy
off
George
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
He
had
ever
been
a
prudent
man
,
and
he
had
money
at
command
.
<EOS>
If
Vavasor
was
such
a
man
as
they
,
who
knew
him
best
,
represented
him
,
such
a
purchase
might
be
possible
.
<EOS>
But
then
,
before
this
was
attempted
,
he
must
be
quite
sure
that
he
knew
his
man
,
and
he
must
satisfy
himself
also
that
in
doing
so
he
would
not
,
in
truth
,
add
to
Alice
's
misery
.
<EOS>
He
could
hardly
bring
himself
to
think
it
possible
that
she
did
,
in
truth
,
love
her
cousin
with
passionate
love
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
to
him
,
as
he
remembered
what
Alice
had
been
to
himself
,
that
this
must
be
impossible
.
<EOS>
But
if
it
were
so
,
that
of
course
must
put
an
end
to
his
interference
.
<EOS>
He
thought
that
if
he
saw
her
he
might
learn
all
this
,
and
therefore
he
went
to
Queen
Anne
Street
.
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
he
must
come
if
he
will
,
"
she
said
to
herself
when
she
received
his
note
.
<EOS>
"
It
can
make
no
matter
.
<EOS>
He
will
say
nothing
half
so
hard
to
me
as
what
I
say
to
myself
all
day
long
.
"
<EOS>
But
when
the
morning
came
,
and
the
hour
came
,
and
the
knock
at
the
door
for
which
her
ears
were
on
the
alert
,
her
heart
misgave
her
,
and
<EOS>
she
felt
that
the
present
moment
of
her
punishment
,
though
not
the
heaviest
,
would
still
be
hard
to
bear
.
  
<EOS>
He
came
slowly
up
-
stairs
,
 
his
step
was
ever
slow
,
 
and
gently
opened
the
door
for
himself
.
<EOS>
Then
,
before
he
even
looked
at
her
,
he
closed
it
again
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
how
to
explain
that
it
was
so
;
but
it
was
this
perfect
command
of
himself
at
all
seasons
which
had
in
part
made
Alice
afraid
of
him
,
and
drove
her
to
believe
that
they
were
not
fitted
for
each
other
.
<EOS>
She
,
when
he
thus
turned
for
a
moment
from
her
,
and
then
walked
slowly
towards
her
,
stood
with
both
her
hands
leaning
on
the
centre
table
of
the
room
,
and
with
her
eyes
fixed
upon
its
surface
.
  
<EOS>
"
Alice
,
"
he
said
,
walking
up
to
her
very
slowly
.
  
<EOS>
Her
whole
frame
shuddered
as
she
heard
the
sweetness
of
his
voice
.
<EOS>
Had
I
not
better
tell
the
truth
of
her
at
once
?
<EOS>
Oh
,
if
she
could
only
have
been
his
again
!
<EOS>
What
madness
during
these
last
six
months
had
driven
her
to
such
a
plight
as
this
!
<EOS>
The
old
love
came
back
upon
her
.
<EOS>
Nay
;
it
had
never
gone
.
<EOS>
But
that
trust
in
his
love
returned
to
her
,
 
that
trust
which
told
her
that
such
love
and
such
worth
would
have
sufficed
to
make
her
happy
.
<EOS>
But
this
confidence
in
him
was
worthless
now
!
<EOS>
Even
though
he
should
desire
it
,
she
could
not
change
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
Alice
,
"
he
said
again
.
<EOS>
And
then
,
as
slowly
she
looked
up
at
him
,
he
asked
her
for
her
hand
.
<EOS>
"
You
may
give
it
me
,
"
he
said
,
"
as
to
an
old
friend
.
"
<EOS>
She
put
her
hand
in
his
hand
,
and
then
,
withdrawing
it
,
felt
that
she
must
never
trust
herself
to
do
so
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
Alice
,
"
he
continued
,
"
I
do
not
expect
you
to
say
much
to
me
;
but
there
is
a
question
or
two
which
I
think
you
will
answer
.
<EOS>
Has
a
day
been
fixed
for
this
marriage
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
she
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
Will
it
be
in
a
month
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
no
;
 
not
for
a
year
,
"
she
replied
hurriedly
;
 
and
he
knew
at
once
by
her
voice
that
she
already
dreaded
this
new
wedlock
.
<EOS>
Whatever
of
anger
he
might
before
have
felt
for
her
was
banished
.
<EOS>
She
had
brought
herself
by
her
ill
-
judgement
,
 
by
her
ignorance
,
as
she
had
confessed
,
 
to
a
sad
pass
;
but
he
believed
that
she
was
still
worthy
of
his
love
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
now
one
other
question
,
Alice
;
 
<EOS>
but
if
you
are
silent
,
I
will
not
ask
it
again
.
<EOS>
Can
you
tell
me
why
you
have
again
accepted
your
cousin
's
offer
?
"
  
"
Because
 
,
"
she
said
very
quickly
,
looking
up
as
though
she
were
about
to
speak
with
all
her
old
courage
.
<EOS>
"
But
you
would
never
understand
me
,
"
she
said
,
 
"
and
there
can
be
no
reason
why
I
should
dare
to
hope
that
you
should
ever
think
well
of
me
again
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
knew
that
there
was
no
love
,
 
<EOS>
no
love
for
that
man
to
whom
she
had
pledged
her
hand
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
know
,
on
the
other
hand
,
how
strong
,
how
unchanged
,
how
true
was
her
love
for
himself
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
of
himself
he
was
thinking
not
at
all
.
<EOS>
He
desired
to
learn
whether
she
would
suffer
,
if
by
any
scheme
he
might
succeed
in
breaking
off
this
marriage
.
<EOS>
When
he
had
asked
her
whether
she
were
to
be
married
at
once
,
she
had
shuddered
at
the
thought
.
<EOS>
When
he
asked
her
why
she
had
accepted
her
cousin
,
she
had
faltered
,
and
hinted
at
some
excuse
which
he
might
fail
to
understand
.
<EOS>
Had
she
loved
George
Vavasor
,
he
could
have
understood
that
well
enough
.
  
<EOS>
"
Alice
,
"
he
said
,
speaking
still
very
slowly
,
"
nothing
has
ever
yet
been
done
which
need
to
a
certainty
separate
you
and
me
.
<EOS>
I
am
a
persistent
man
,
and
I
do
not
even
yet
give
up
all
hope
.
<EOS>
A
year
is
a
long
time
.
<EOS>
As
you
say
yourself
,
I
do
not
as
yet
quite
understand
you
.
<EOS>
But
,
Alice
,
 
and
I
think
that
the
position
in
which
we
stood
a
few
months
since
justifies
me
in
saying
so
without
offence
,
 
I
love
you
now
as
well
as
ever
,
and
should
things
change
with
you
<EOS>
,
I
can
not
tell
you
with
how
much
joy
and
eagerness
I
should
take
you
back
to
my
bosom
.
<EOS>
My
heart
is
yours
now
as
it
has
been
since
I
knew
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Then
he
again
just
touched
her
hand
,
and
left
her
before
she
had
been
able
to
answer
a
word
.
   
<EOS>
Mr.
Tombe
's
Advice
.
 
<EOS>
Alice
sat
alone
for
an
hour
without
moving
when
John
Grey
had
left
her
,
and
the
last
words
which
he
had
uttered
were
sounding
in
her
ears
all
the
time
,
"
My
heart
is
still
yours
,
as
it
has
been
since
I
knew
you
.
<EOS>
"
There
had
been
something
in
his
words
which
had
soothed
her
spirits
,
and
had
,
for
the
moment
,
almost
comforted
her
.
<EOS>
At
any
rate
,
he
did
not
despise
her
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
have
spoken
such
words
as
these
to
her
had
he
not
still
held
her
high
in
his
esteem
.
<EOS>
Nay
;
 
had
he
not
even
declared
that
he
would
yet
take
her
as
his
own
if
she
would
come
to
him
?
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
tell
you
with
how
much
joy
I
would
take
you
back
to
my
bosom
!
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
that
might
never
be
.
<EOS>
But
yet
the
assurance
had
been
sweet
to
her
;
 
dangerously
sweet
,
as
she
soon
told
herself
.
<EOS>
She
knew
that
she
had
lost
her
Eden
,
but
it
was
something
to
her
that
the
master
of
the
garden
had
not
himself
driven
her
forth
.
<EOS>
She
sat
there
,
thinking
of
her
fate
,
as
though
it
belonged
to
some
other
one
,
 
not
to
herself
;
as
though
it
were
a
tale
that
she
had
read
.
<EOS>
Herself
she
had
shipwrecked
altogether
;
but
though
she
might
sink
,
she
had
not
been
thrust
from
the
ship
by
hands
which
she
loved
.
  
<EOS>
But
would
it
not
have
been
better
that
he
should
have
scorned
her
and
reviled
her
?
<EOS>
Had
he
been
able
to
do
so
<EOS>
,
he
at
least
would
have
escaped
the
grief
of
disappointed
love
.
<EOS>
Had
he
learned
to
despise
her
,
he
would
have
ceased
to
regret
her
.
<EOS>
She
had
no
right
to
feel
consolation
in
the
fact
that
his
sufferings
were
equal
to
her
own
.
<EOS>
But
when
she
thought
of
this
,
she
told
herself
that
it
could
not
be
that
it
was
so
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
man
,
she
said
,
not
passionate
by
nature
.
<EOS>
Alas
!
<EOS>
it
was
the
mistake
she
had
ever
made
when
summing
up
the
items
of
his
character
!
<EOS>
He
might
be
persistent
,
she
thought
,
in
still
striving
to
do
that
upon
which
he
had
once
resolved
.
<EOS>
He
had
said
so
,
and
that
which
he
said
was
always
true
to
the
letter
.
<EOS>
But
,
nevertheless
,
when
this
thing
which
he
still
chose
to
pursue
should
have
been
put
absolutely
beyond
his
reach
,
he
would
not
allow
his
calm
bosom
to
be
harassed
by
a
vain
regret
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
man
too
whole
at
every
point
,
 
<EOS>
so
Alice
told
herself
,
 
to
allow
his
happiness
to
be
marred
by
such
an
accident
.
  
<EOS>
But
must
the
accident
occur
?
<EOS>
Was
there
no
chance
that
he
might
be
saved
,
even
from
such
trouble
as
might
follow
upon
such
a
loss
?
<EOS>
Could
it
not
be
possible
that
he
might
be
gratified
,
 
since
it
would
gratify
him
,
 
and
that
she
might
be
saved
!
<EOS>
Over
and
over
again
she
considered
this
,
 
but
always
as
though
it
were
another
woman
whom
she
would
fain
save
,
and
not
herself
.
  
<EOS>
But
she
knew
that
her
own
fate
was
fixed
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
mad
when
she
had
done
the
thing
,
but
the
thing
was
not
on
that
account
the
less
done
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
mad
when
she
had
trusted
herself
abroad
with
two
persons
,
both
of
whom
,
as
she
had
well
known
,
were
intent
on
wrenching
her
happiness
from
out
of
her
grasp
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
mad
when
she
had
told
herself
,
whilst
walking
over
the
Westmoreland
fells
,
that
after
all
she
might
as
well
marry
her
cousin
,
since
that
other
marriage
was
then
beyond
her
reach
!
<EOS>
Her
two
cousins
had
succeeded
in
blighting
all
the
hopes
of
her
life
;
 
but
what
could
she
now
think
of
herself
in
that
she
had
been
so
weak
as
to
submit
to
such
usage
from
their
hands
?
<EOS>
Alas
!
 
<EOS>
she
told
herself
,
admitting
in
her
misery
all
her
weakness
,
 
alas
<EOS>
,
she
had
no
mother
.
<EOS>
She
had
gloried
in
her
independence
,
and
this
had
come
of
it
!
<EOS>
She
had
scorned
the
prudence
of
Lady
Macleod
,
and
her
scorn
had
brought
her
to
this
pass
!
  
<EOS>
Was
she
to
give
herself
bodily
,
 
body
and
soul
,
as
she
said
aloud
in
her
solitary
agony
,
 
to
a
man
whom
she
did
not
love
?
<EOS>
Must
she
submit
to
his
caresses
,
 
lie
on
his
bosom
,
 
turn
herself
warmly
to
his
kisses
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
"
she
said
,
"
no
,
"
 
speaking
audibly
,
as
she
walked
about
the
room
;
"
no
;
 
<EOS>
it
was
not
in
my
bargain
;
I
never
meant
it
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
if
so
what
had
she
meant
;
 
what
had
been
her
dream
?
<EOS>
Of
what
marriage
had
she
thought
,
when
she
was
writing
that
letter
back
to
George
Vavasor
?
<EOS>
How
am
I
to
analyse
her
mind
,
and
make
her
thoughts
and
feelings
intelligible
to
those
who
may
care
to
trouble
themselves
with
the
study
?
<EOS>
Any
sacrifice
she
would
make
for
her
cousin
which
one
friend
could
make
for
another
.
<EOS>
She
would
fight
his
battles
with
her
money
,
with
her
words
,
with
her
sympathy
.
<EOS>
She
would
sit
with
him
if
he
needed
it
,
and
speak
comfort
to
him
by
the
hour
.
<EOS>
His
disgrace
should
be
her
disgrace
;
 
his
glory
her
glory
;
 
his
pursuits
her
pursuits
.
<EOS>
Was
not
that
the
marriage
to
which
she
had
consented
?
<EOS>
But
he
had
come
to
her
and
asked
her
for
a
kiss
,
and
she
had
shuddered
before
him
,
when
he
made
the
demand
.
<EOS>
Then
that
other
one
had
come
and
had
touched
her
hand
,
and
the
fibres
of
her
body
had
seemed
to
melt
within
her
at
the
touch
,
so
that
she
could
have
fallen
at
his
feet
.
  
<EOS>
She
had
done
very
wrong
.
<EOS>
She
knew
that
she
had
done
wrong
.
<EOS>
She
knew
that
she
had
sinned
with
that
sin
which
specially
disgraces
a
woman
.
<EOS>
She
had
said
that
she
would
become
the
wife
of
a
man
to
whom
she
could
not
cleave
with
a
wife
's
love
;
and
,
mad
with
a
vile
ambition
,
she
had
given
up
the
man
for
whose
modest
love
<EOS>
her
heart
was
longing
.
<EOS>
She
had
thrown
off
from
her
that
wondrous
aroma
of
precious
delicacy
,
which
is
the
greatest
treasure
of
womanhood
.
<EOS>
She
had
sinned
against
her
sex
;
and
,
in
an
agony
of
despair
,
as
she
crouched
down
upon
the
floor
with
her
head
against
her
chair
,
she
told
herself
that
there
was
no
pardon
for
her
.
<EOS>
She
understood
it
now
,
and
knew
that
she
could
not
forgive
herself
.
  
<EOS>
But
can
you
forgive
her
,
delicate
reader
?
<EOS>
Or
am
I
asking
the
question
too
early
in
my
story
?
<EOS>
For
myself
,
I
have
forgiven
her
.
<EOS>
The
story
of
the
struggle
has
been
present
to
my
mind
for
many
years
,
 
and
I
have
learned
to
think
that
even
this
offence
against
womanhood
may
,
with
deep
repentance
,
be
forgiven
.
<EOS>
And
you
also
must
forgive
her
before
we
close
the
book
,
or
else
my
story
will
have
been
told
amiss
.
  
<EOS>
But
let
us
own
that
she
had
sinned
,
 
almost
damnably
,
almost
past
forgiveness
.
<EOS>
What
;
 
think
that
she
knew
what
love
meant
,
and
not
know
which
of
two
she
loved
!
<EOS>
What
;
 
doubt
,
of
two
men
for
whose
arms
she
longed
,
of
which
the
kisses
would
be
sweet
to
bear
;
on
which
side
lay
the
modesty
of
her
maiden
love
!
<EOS>
Faugh
!
<EOS>
She
had
submitted
to
pollution
of
heart
and
feeling
before
she
had
brought
herself
to
such
a
pass
as
this
.
<EOS>
Come
;
 
<EOS>
let
us
see
if
it
be
possible
that
she
may
be
cleansed
by
the
fire
of
her
sorrow
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
am
I
to
do
?
"
<EOS>
She
passed
that
whole
day
in
asking
herself
that
question
.
<EOS>
She
was
herself
astounded
at
the
rapidity
with
which
the
conviction
had
forced
itself
upon
her
that
a
marriage
with
her
cousin
would
be
to
her
almost
impossible
;
and
could
she
permit
it
to
be
said
of
her
that
she
had
thrice
in
her
career
<EOS>
jilted
a
promised
suitor
,
 
that
three
times
she
would
go
back
from
her
word
because
her
fancy
had
changed
?
<EOS>
Where
could
she
find
the
courage
to
tell
her
father
,
to
tell
Kate
,
to
tell
even
George
himself
,
that
her
purpose
was
again
altered
?
<EOS>
But
she
had
a
year
at
her
disposal
.
<EOS>
If
only
during
that
year
he
would
take
her
money
and
squander
it
,
and
then
require
nothing
further
of
her
hands
,
might
she
not
thus
escape
the
doom
before
her
?
<EOS>
Might
it
not
be
possible
that
the
refusal
should
this
time
come
from
him
?
<EOS>
But
she
succeeded
in
making
one
resolve
.
<EOS>
She
thought
at
least
that
she
succeeded
.
<EOS>
Come
what
might
,
she
would
never
stand
with
him
at
the
altar
.
<EOS>
While
there
was
a
cliff
from
which
she
might
fall
,
water
that
would
cover
her
,
a
death
-
dealing
grain
that
might
be
mixed
in
her
cup
,
she
could
not
submit
herself
to
be
George
Vavasor
's
wife
.
<EOS>
To
no
ear
could
she
tell
of
this
resolve
.
<EOS>
To
no
friend
could
she
hint
her
purpose
.
<EOS>
She
owed
her
money
to
the
man
after
what
had
passed
between
them
.
<EOS>
It
was
his
right
to
count
upon
such
assistance
as
that
would
give
him
,
and
he
should
have
it
.
<EOS>
Only
as
his
betrothed
she
could
give
it
him
,
for
she
understood
well
that
if
there
were
any
breach
between
them
,
his
accepting
of
such
aid
would
be
impossible
.
<EOS>
He
should
have
her
money
,
and
then
,
when
the
day
came
,
some
escape
should
be
found
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
afternoon
her
father
came
to
her
,
and
it
may
be
as
well
to
explain
that
Mr.
Grey
had
seen
him
again
that
day
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Grey
,
when
he
left
Queen
Anne
Street
,
had
gone
to
his
lawyer
,
and
from
thence
had
made
his
way
to
Mr.
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
It
was
between
five
and
six
when
Mr.
Vavasor
came
back
to
his
house
,
and
he
then
found
his
daughter
sitting
over
the
drawing
-
room
fire
,
without
lights
,
in
the
gloom
of
the
evening
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Vavasor
had
returned
with
Grey
to
the
lawyer
's
chambers
,
and
had
from
thence
come
direct
to
his
own
house
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
startled
at
the
precision
with
which
all
the
circumstances
of
his
daughter
's
position
had
been
explained
to
a
mild
-
eyed
old
gentleman
,
with
a
bald
head
,
who
carried
on
his
business
in
a
narrow
,
dark
,
clean
street
,
behind
Doctors
"
Commons
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Tombe
was
his
name
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
;
"
Mr.
Grey
had
said
,
when
Mr.
Vavasor
had
asked
as
to
the
peculiar
nature
of
Mr.
Tombe
's
business
;
"
he
is
not
specially
an
ecclesiastical
lawyer
.
<EOS>
He
had
a
partner
at
Ely
,
and
was
always
employed
by
my
father
,
and
by
most
of
the
clergy
there
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Tombe
had
evinced
no
surprise
,
no
dismay
,
and
certainly
no
mock
delicacy
,
when
the
whole
affair
was
under
discussion
.
<EOS>
George
Vavasor
was
to
get
present
moneys
,
but
,
 
if
it
could
be
so
arranged
 
from
John
Grey
's
stores
rather
than
from
those
belonging
to
Alice
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Tombe
could
probably
arrange
that
with
Mr.
Vavasor
's
lawyer
,
who
would
no
doubt
be
able
to
make
difficulty
as
to
raising
ready
money
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Tombe
would
be
able
to
raise
ready
money
without
difficulty
.
<EOS>
And
then
,
at
last
,
George
Vavasor
was
to
be
made
to
surrender
his
bride
,
taking
or
having
taken
the
price
of
his
bargain
.
<EOS>
John
Vavasor
sat
by
in
silence
as
the
arrangement
was
being
made
,
not
knowing
how
to
speak
.
<EOS>
He
had
no
money
with
which
to
give
assistance
.
<EOS>
"
I
wish
you
to
understand
from
the
lady
's
father
,
"
Grey
said
to
the
lawyer
,
"
that
the
marriage
would
be
regarded
by
him
with
as
much
dismay
as
by
myself
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Certainly
;
 
it
would
be
ruinous
,
"
Mr.
Vavasor
had
answered
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
you
see
,
<EOS>
Mr.
Tombe
,
"
Mr.
Grey
went
on
,
"
we
only
wish
to
try
the
man
.
<EOS>
If
he
be
not
such
as
we
believe
him
to
be
,
he
can
prove
it
by
his
conduct
.
<EOS>
If
he
is
worthy
of
her
,
he
can
then
take
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
merely
wish
to
open
her
eyes
,
Mr.
Grey
,
"
said
the
mild
-
eyed
lawyer
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
that
he
should
have
what
money
he
wants
,
and
then
we
shall
find
what
it
is
he
really
wishes
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Yes
;
we
shall
know
our
man
,
"
said
the
lawyer
.
<EOS>
"
He
shall
have
the
money
,
Mr.
Grey
,
"
and
so
the
interview
had
been
ended
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Vavasor
,
when
he
entered
the
drawing
-
room
,
addressed
his
daughter
in
a
cheery
voice
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
;
all
in
the
dark
?
"
  
"
Yes
,
papa
.
<EOS>
Why
should
I
have
candles
when
I
am
doing
nothing
?
<EOS>
I
did
not
expect
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
I
suppose
not
.
<EOS>
I
came
here
because
I
want
to
say
a
few
words
to
you
about
business
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
business
,
papa
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Alice
well
understood
the
tone
of
her
father
's
voice
.
<EOS>
He
was
desirous
of
propitiating
her
;
but
was
at
the
same
time
desirous
of
carrying
some
point
in
which
he
thought
it
probable
that
she
would
oppose
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
;
my
love
,
if
I
understood
you
rightly
,
your
cousin
George
wants
some
money
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
not
say
that
he
wants
it
now
;
but
I
think
he
will
want
it
before
the
time
for
the
election
comes
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
so
,
he
will
want
it
at
once
.
<EOS>
He
has
not
asked
you
for
it
yet
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
he
has
merely
said
that
should
he
be
in
need
he
would
take
me
at
my
word
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
there
is
no
doubt
that
he
wants
it
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
I
believe
that
he
is
almost
entirely
without
present
means
of
his
own
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
hardly
think
so
;
but
I
have
no
knowledge
about
it
.
<EOS>
I
can
only
say
that
he
has
not
asked
me
yet
,
and
that
I
should
wish
to
oblige
him
whenever
he
may
do
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
To
what
extent
,
Alice
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
what
I
have
.
<EOS>
I
get
about
four
hundred
a
year
,
but
I
do
not
know
what
it
is
worth
,
or
how
far
it
can
all
be
turned
into
money
.
<EOS>
I
should
wish
to
keep
a
hundred
a
year
and
let
him
have
the
rest
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
;
eight
thousand
pounds
!
<EOS>
"
said
the
father
who
in
spite
of
his
wish
not
to
oppose
her
,
could
not
but
express
his
dismay
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
imagine
that
he
will
want
so
much
;
but
if
he
should
,
I
wish
that
he
should
have
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Heaven
and
earth
!
"
said
John
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
"
Of
course
we
should
have
to
give
up
the
house
.
<EOS>
"
He
could
not
suppress
his
trouble
,
or
refrain
from
bursting
out
in
agony
at
the
prospect
of
such
a
loss
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
he
has
asked
me
for
nothing
yet
,
papa
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
exactly
;
and
perhaps
he
may
not
;
but
I
wish
to
know
what
to
do
when
the
demand
is
made
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
going
to
oppose
you
now
;
your
money
is
your
own
,
and
you
have
a
right
to
do
with
it
as
you
please
;
 
but
would
you
gratify
me
in
one
thing
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
it
,
papa
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
When
he
does
apply
,
let
the
amount
be
raised
through
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
through
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Come
to
me
;
I
mean
,
so
that
I
may
see
the
lawyer
,
and
have
the
arrangements
made
.
<EOS>
"
Then
he
explained
to
her
that
in
dealing
with
large
sums
of
money
,
it
could
not
be
right
that
she
should
do
so
without
his
knowledge
,
even
though
the
property
was
her
own
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
promise
you
that
I
will
not
oppose
your
wishes
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
Then
Alice
undertook
that
when
such
case
should
arise
the
money
should
be
raised
through
his
means
.
  
<EOS>
The
day
but
one
following
this
she
received
a
letter
from
Lady
Glencora
,
who
was
still
at
Matching
Priory
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
light
-
spirited
,
chatty
,
amusing
letter
,
intended
to
be
happy
in
its
tone
,
 
intended
to
have
a
flavour
of
happiness
,
but
just
failing
through
the
too
apparent
meaning
of
a
word
here
and
there
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
see
that
I
am
at
Matching
,
"
the
letter
said
,
"
whereas
you
will
remember
that
I
was
to
have
been
at
Monkshade
.
<EOS>
I
escaped
at
last
by
a
violent
effort
,
and
am
now
passing
my
time
innocently
,
 
<EOS>
I
fear
not
so
profitably
as
she
would
induce
me
to
do
,
 
with
Iphy
Palliser
.
<EOS>
You
remember
Iphy
.
<EOS>
She
is
a
good
creature
,
and
would
fain
turn
even
me
to
profit
,
if
it
were
possible
.
<EOS>
I
own
that
I
am
thinking
of
them
all
at
Monkshade
,
and
am
in
truth
delighted
that
I
am
not
there
.
<EOS>
My
absence
is
entirely
laid
upon
your
shoulders
.
<EOS>
That
wicked
evening
amidst
the
ruins
!
<EOS>
Poor
ruins
.
<EOS>
I
go
there
alone
sometimes
and
fancy
that
I
hear
such
voices
from
the
walls
,
and
see
such
faces
through
the
broken
windows
!
<EOS>
All
the
old
Pallisers
come
and
frown
at
me
,
and
tell
me
that
I
am
not
good
enough
to
belong
to
them
.
<EOS>
There
is
a
particular
window
to
which
Sir
Guy
comes
and
makes
faces
at
me
.
<EOS>
I
told
Iphy
the
other
day
,
and
she
answered
me
very
gravely
,
that
I
might
,
if
I
chose
,
make
myself
good
enough
for
the
Pallisers
.
<EOS>
Even
for
the
Pallisers
!
<EOS>
Is
n't
that
beautiful
?
"
  
<EOS>
Then
Lady
Glencora
went
on
to
say
,
that
her
husband
intended
to
come
up
to
London
early
in
the
session
,
and
that
she
would
accompany
him
.
<EOS>
"
That
is
,
"
added
Lady
Glencora
,
"
if
I
am
still
good
enough
for
the
Pallisers
at
that
time
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
Inn
at
Shap
.
 
<EOS>
When
George
Vavasor
left
Mr.
Scruby
's
office
 
the
attentive
reader
will
remember
that
he
did
call
upon
Mr.
Scruby
,
the
Parliamentary
lawyer
,
and
there
recognised
the
necessity
of
putting
himself
in
possession
of
a
small
sum
of
money
with
as
little
delay
as
possible
;
 
when
he
left
the
attorney
's
office
,
he
was
well
aware
that
the
work
to
be
done
was
still
before
him
.
<EOS>
And
he
knew
also
that
the
job
to
be
undertaken
was
a
very
disagreeable
job
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
like
the
task
of
borrowing
his
cousin
Alice
's
money
.
  
<EOS>
We
all
of
us
know
that
swindlers
and
rogues
do
very
dirty
tricks
,
and
we
are
apt
to
picture
to
ourselves
a
certain
amount
of
gusto
and
delight
on
the
part
of
the
swindlers
in
the
doing
of
them
.
<EOS>
In
this
,
I
think
we
are
wrong
.
<EOS>
The
poor
,
broken
,
semi
-
genteel
beggar
,
who
borrows
half
-
sovereigns
apiece
from
all
his
old
acquaintances
,
knowing
that
they
know
that
he
will
never
repay
them
,
suffers
a
separate
little
agony
with
each
petition
that
he
makes
.
<EOS>
He
does
not
enjoy
pleasant
sailing
in
this
journey
which
he
is
making
.
<EOS>
To
be
refused
is
painful
to
him
.
<EOS>
To
get
his
half
sovereign
with
scorn
is
painful
.
<EOS>
To
get
it
with
apparent
confidence
in
his
honour
is
almost
more
painful
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
D
 
---
it
<EOS>
,
"
he
says
to
himself
on
such
rare
occasions
,
"
I
will
pay
that
fellow
;
"
and
yet
,
as
he
says
it
,
he
knows
that
he
never
will
pay
even
that
fellow
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
comfortless
unsatisfying
trade
,
that
of
living
upon
other
people
's
money
.
  
<EOS>
How
was
George
Vavasor
to
make
his
first
step
towards
getting
his
hand
into
his
cousin
's
purse
?
<EOS>
He
had
gone
to
her
asking
for
her
love
,
and
she
had
shuddered
when
he
asked
her
.
<EOS>
That
had
been
the
commencement
of
their
life
under
their
new
engagement
.
<EOS>
He
knew
very
well
that
the
money
would
be
forthcoming
when
he
demanded
it
,
 
but
under
their
present
joint
circumstances
<EOS>
,
how
was
he
to
make
the
demand
?
<EOS>
If
he
wrote
to
her
,
should
he
simply
ask
for
money
,
and
make
no
allusion
to
his
love
?
<EOS>
If
he
went
to
her
in
person
,
should
he
make
his
visit
a
mere
visit
of
business
,
 
as
he
might
call
on
his
banker
?
  
<EOS>
He
resolved
at
last
that
Kate
should
do
the
work
for
him
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
he
had
felt
all
along
that
it
would
be
well
that
Kate
should
act
as
ambassador
between
him
and
Alice
in
money
matters
,
as
she
had
long
done
in
other
things
.
<EOS>
He
could
talk
to
Kate
as
he
could
not
talk
to
Alice
;
 
and
then
,
between
the
women
,
those
hard
money
necessities
would
be
softened
down
by
a
romantic
phraseology
which
he
would
not
himself
know
how
to
use
with
any
effect
.
<EOS>
He
made
up
his
mind
to
see
Kate
,
and
with
this
view
he
went
down
to
Westmoreland
;
and
took
himself
to
a
small
wayside
inn
at
Shap
among
the
fells
,
which
had
been
known
to
him
of
old
.
<EOS>
He
gave
his
sister
notice
that
he
would
be
there
,
and
begged
her
to
come
over
to
him
as
early
as
she
might
find
it
possible
on
the
morning
after
his
arrival
.
<EOS>
He
himself
reached
the
place
late
in
the
evening
by
train
from
London
.
<EOS>
There
is
a
station
at
Shap
,
by
which
the
railway
company
no
doubt
conceives
that
it
has
conferred
on
that
somewhat
rough
and
remote
locality
all
the
advantages
of
a
refined
civilization
;
but
I
doubt
whether
the
Shappites
have
been
thankful
for
the
favour
.
<EOS>
The
landlord
at
the
inn
,
for
one
,
is
not
thankful
.
<EOS>
Shap
had
been
a
place
owing
all
such
life
as
it
had
possessed
to
coaching
and
posting
.
<EOS>
It
had
been
a
stage
on
the
high
road
from
Lancaster
to
Carlisle
,
and
though
it
lay
high
and
bleak
among
the
fells
,
and
was
a
cold
,
windy
,
thinly
-
populated
place
,
 
filling
all
travellers
with
thankfulness
that
they
had
not
been
made
Shappites
,
nevertheless
,
it
had
had
its
glory
in
its
coaching
and
posting
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
doubt
that
there
are
men
and
women
who
look
back
with
a
fond
regret
to
the
palmy
days
of
Shap
.
  
<EOS>
Vavasor
reached
the
little
inn
about
nine
in
the
evening
on
a
night
that
was
pitchy
dark
,
and
in
a
wind
which
made
it
necessary
for
him
to
hold
his
hat
on
to
his
head
.
<EOS>
"
What
a
beastly
country
to
live
in
,
"
he
said
to
himself
,
resolving
that
he
would
certainly
sell
Vavasor
Hall
in
spite
of
all
family
associations
,
if
ever
the
power
to
do
so
should
be
his
.
"
<EOS>
What
trash
it
is
,
"
he
said
,
"
hanging
on
to
such
a
place
as
that
without
the
means
of
living
like
a
gentleman
,
simply
because
one
's
ancestors
have
done
so
.
"
<EOS>
And
then
he
expressed
a
doubt
to
himself
whether
all
the
world
contained
a
more
ignorant
,
opinionated
,
useless
old
man
than
his
grandfather
,
 
or
,
in
short
,
a
greater
fool
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Mr.
George
,
"
said
the
landlord
as
soon
as
he
saw
him
,
"
a
sight
of
you
's
guid
for
sair
een
.
<EOS>
It
's
o'er
lang
since
you
've
been
<EOS>
doon
amang
the
fells
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
George
did
not
want
to
converse
with
the
innkeeper
,
or
to
explain
how
it
was
that
he
did
not
visit
Vavasor
Hall
.
<EOS>
The
innkeeper
,
no
doubt
,
knew
all
about
it
,
 
knew
that
the
grandfather
had
quarrelled
with
his
grandson
,
and
knew
the
reason
why
;
but
George
,
if
he
suspected
such
knowledge
,
did
not
choose
to
refer
to
it
.
<EOS>
So
he
simply
grunted
something
in
reply
,
and
getting
himself
in
before
a
spark
of
fire
which
hardly
was
burning
in
a
public
room
with
a
sandy
floor
,
begged
that
the
little
sitting
-
room
up
-
stairs
might
be
got
ready
for
him
.
<EOS>
There
he
passed
the
evening
in
solitude
,
giving
no
encouragement
to
the
landlord
,
who
,
nevertheless
,
looked
him
up
three
or
four
times
,
 
till
at
last
George
<EOS>
said
that
his
head
ached
,
and
that
he
would
wish
to
be
alone
.
"
<EOS>
He
was
always
one
of
them
cankery
chiels
as
never
have
a
kindly
word
for
man
nor
beast
,
"
said
the
landlord
.
<EOS>
"
Seems
as
though
that
raw
slash
in
his
face
had
gone
right
through
into
his
heart
.
"
<EOS>
After
that
George
was
left
alone
,
and
sat
thinking
whether
it
would
not
be
better
to
ask
Alice
for
two
thousand
pounds
at
once
,
 
so
as
to
save
him
from
the
disagreeable
necessity
of
a
second
borrowing
before
their
marriage
.
<EOS>
He
was
very
uneasy
in
his
mind
.
<EOS>
He
had
flattered
himself
through
it
all
that
his
cousin
had
loved
him
.
<EOS>
He
had
felt
sure
that
such
was
the
case
while
they
were
together
in
Switzerland
.
<EOS>
When
she
had
determined
to
give
up
John
Grey
,
of
course
he
had
told
himself
the
same
thing
.
<EOS>
When
she
had
at
once
answered
his
first
subsequent
overture
with
an
assent
,
he
had
of
course
been
certain
that
it
was
so
.
<EOS>
Dark
,
selfish
,
and
even
dishonest
as
he
was
,
he
had
,
nevertheless
,
enjoyed
something
of
a
lover
's
true
pleasure
in
believing
that
Alice
had
still
loved
him
through
all
their
mischances
.
<EOS>
But
his
joy
had
<EOS>
in
a
moment
been
turned
into
gall
during
that
interview
in
Queen
Anne
Street
.
<EOS>
He
had
read
the
truth
at
a
glance
.
<EOS>
A
man
must
be
very
vain
,
or
else
very
little
used
to
such
matters
,
who
at
George
Vavasor
's
age
can
not
understand
the
feelings
with
which
a
woman
receives
him
.
<EOS>
When
Alice
contrived
as
she
had
done
to
escape
the
embrace
he
was
so
well
justified
in
asking
,
he
knew
the
whole
truth
.
<EOS>
He
was
sore
at
heart
,
and
very
angry
withal
.
<EOS>
He
could
have
readily
spurned
her
from
him
,
and
rejected
her
who
had
once
rejected
him
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
done
so
had
not
his
need
for
her
money
restrained
him
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
a
man
who
could
deceive
himself
in
such
matters
.
<EOS>
He
knew
that
this
was
so
,
and
he
told
himself
that
he
was
a
rascal
.
  
<EOS>
Vavasor
Hall
was
,
by
the
road
,
about
five
miles
from
Shap
,
and
it
was
not
altogether
an
easy
task
for
Kate
to
get
over
to
the
village
without
informing
her
grandfather
that
the
visit
was
to
be
made
,
and
what
was
its
purport
.
<EOS>
She
could
,
indeed
,
walk
,
and
the
walk
would
not
be
so
long
as
that
she
had
taken
with
Alice
to
Swindale
fell
;
 
but
walking
to
an
inn
on
a
high
road
,
is
not
the
same
thing
as
walking
to
a
point
on
a
hill
side
over
a
lake
.
<EOS>
Had
she
been
dirty
,
draggled
,
and
wet
through
on
Swindale
<EOS>
fell
,
it
would
have
simply
been
matter
for
mirth
;
but
her
brother
she
knew
would
not
have
liked
to
see
her
enter
the
Lowther
Arms
at
Shap
in
such
a
condition
.
<EOS>
It
,
therefore
,
became
necessary
that
she
should
ask
her
grandfather
to
lend
her
the
jaunting
car
.
  
<EOS>
"
Where
do
you
want
to
go
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
sharply
.
<EOS>
In
such
establishments
as
that
at
Vavasor
Hall
the
family
horse
is
generally
used
for
double
duties
.
<EOS>
Though
he
draws
the
lady
of
the
house
one
day
,
he
is
not
too
proud
to
draw
manure
on
the
next
.
<EOS>
And
it
will
always
be
found
that
the
master
of
the
house
gives
a
great
preference
to
the
manure
over
the
lady
.
<EOS>
The
squire
at
Vavasor
had
come
to
do
so
to
such
an
extent
that
he
regarded
any
application
for
the
animal
's
services
as
an
encroachment
.
  
<EOS>
"
Only
to
Shap
,
grandpapa
.
"
  
"
To
Shap
!
<EOS>
what
on
earth
can
take
you
to
Shap
?
<EOS>
There
are
no
shops
at
Shap
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
going
to
do
shopping
.
<EOS>
I
want
to
see
some
one
there
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Whom
can
you
want
to
see
at
Shap
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Then
it
occurred
to
Kate
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
that
she
might
as
well
tell
her
grandfather
the
fact
.
<EOS>
"
My
brother
has
come
down
,
"
she
said
;
"
and
is
at
the
inn
there
.
<EOS>
I
had
not
intended
to
tell
you
,
as
I
did
not
wish
to
mention
his
name
till
you
had
consented
to
receive
him
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
he
expects
to
come
here
now
;
 
does
he
?
"
said
the
squire
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
no
,
sir
.
<EOS>
I
think
he
has
no
expectation
of
the
kind
.
<EOS>
He
has
come
down
simply
to
see
me
;
 
about
business
I
believe
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Business
!
<EOS>
what
business
?
<EOS>
I
suppose
he
wants
to
get
your
money
from
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
is
with
reference
to
his
marriage
.
<EOS>
I
think
he
wants
me
to
use
my
influence
with
Alice
that
it
may
not
be
delayed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Look
here
,
Kate
;
if
ever
you
lend
him
your
money
,
or
any
of
it
,
 
that
is
,
of
the
principal
I
mean
,
 
I
will
never
speak
to
him
again
under
any
circumstance
.
<EOS>
And
more
than
that
!
<EOS>
Look
here
,
Kate
.
<EOS>
In
spite
of
all
that
has
past
and
gone
,
the
property
will
become
his
for
his
life
when
I
die
,
 
unless
I
change
my
will
.
<EOS>
If
he
gets
your
money
from
you
,
I
will
change
it
,
and
he
shall
not
be
a
shilling
richer
at
my
death
than
he
is
now
.
<EOS>
You
can
have
the
horse
to
go
to
Shap
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
What
unlucky
chance
had
it
been
which
had
put
this
idea
into
the
old
squire
's
head
on
this
especial
morning
?
<EOS>
Kate
had
resolved
that
she
would
entreat
her
brother
to
make
use
of
her
little
fortune
.
<EOS>
She
feared
that
he
was
now
coming
with
some
reference
to
his
cousin
's
money
,
 
that
something
was
to
be
done
to
enable
him
to
avail
himself
of
his
cousin
's
offer
;
and
Kate
,
almost
blushing
in
the
solitude
of
her
chamber
at
the
thought
,
was
determined
that
her
brother
must
be
saved
from
such
temptation
.
<EOS>
She
knew
that
money
was
necessary
to
him
.
<EOS>
She
knew
that
he
could
not
stand
a
second
contest
without
assistance
.
<EOS>
With
all
their
confidences
,
he
had
never
told
her
much
of
his
pecuniary
circumstances
in
the
world
,
but
she
was
almost
sure
that
he
was
a
poor
man
.
<EOS>
He
had
said
as
much
as
that
to
her
,
and
in
his
letter
desiring
her
to
come
to
him
at
Shap
,
he
had
inserted
a
word
or
two
purposely
intended
to
prepare
her
mind
for
monetary
considerations
.
  
<EOS>
As
she
was
jogged
along
over
the
rough
road
to
Shap
,
she
made
up
her
mind
that
Aunt
Greenow
would
be
the
proper
person
to
defray
the
expense
of
the
coming
election
.
<EOS>
To
give
Kate
her
due
she
would
have
given
up
every
shilling
of
her
own
money
without
a
moment
's
hesitation
,
or
any
feeling
that
her
brother
would
be
wrong
to
accept
it
.
<EOS>
Nor
would
she
,
perhaps
,
have
been
unalterably
opposed
to
his
taking
Alice
's
money
,
had
Alice
simply
been
his
cousin
.
<EOS>
She
felt
that
as
Vavasors
they
were
bound
to
stand
by
the
future
head
of
the
family
in
an
attempt
which
was
to
be
made
,
as
she
felt
,
for
the
general
Vavasor
interest
.
<EOS>
But
she
could
not
endure
to
think
that
her
brother
should
take
the
money
of
the
girl
whom
he
was
engaged
to
marry
.
<EOS>
Aunt
Greenow
's
money
she
thought
was
fair
game
.
<EOS>
Aunt
Greenow
herself
had
made
various
liberal
offers
to
herself
which
Kate
had
declined
,
not
caring
to
be
under
pecuniary
obligations
even
to
Aunt
Greenow
without
necessity
;
but
she
felt
that
for
such
a
purpose
as
her
brother
's
contest
,
she
need
not
hesitate
to
ask
for
assistance
,
and
she
thought
also
that
such
assistance
would
be
forthcoming
.
  
<EOS>
"
Grandpapa
knows
that
you
are
here
,
George
,
"
said
Kate
,
when
their
first
greeting
was
over
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
deuce
he
does
!
<EOS>
and
why
did
you
tell
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
could
not
get
the
car
to
come
in
without
letting
him
know
why
I
wanted
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
nonsense
!
<EOS>
as
if
you
could
n't
have
made
any
excuse
!
<EOS>
I
was
particularly
anxious
that
he
should
not
guess
that
I
am
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
see
that
it
can
make
any
difference
,
George
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
see
that
it
can
,
 
a
very
great
difference
.
<EOS>
It
may
prevent
my
ever
being
able
to
get
near
him
again
before
he
dies
.
<EOS>
What
did
he
say
about
my
coming
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
did
n't
say
much
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
made
no
offer
as
to
my
going
there
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
not
have
gone
if
he
had
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
now
that
I
ever
shall
go
.
<EOS>
To
be
there
to
do
any
good
,
 
so
as
to
make
him
alter
his
will
,
and
leave
me
in
the
position
which
I
have
a
right
to
expect
,
would
take
more
time
than
the
whole
property
is
worth
.
<EOS>
And
he
would
endeavour
to
tie
me
down
in
some
way
I
could
not
stand
;
 
perhaps
ask
me
to
give
up
my
notion
for
going
into
Parliament
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
might
ask
you
,
but
he
would
not
make
it
ground
for
another
quarrel
,
if
you
refused
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
so
unreasonable
and
ignorant
that
I
am
better
away
from
him
.
<EOS>
But
,
Kate
,
you
have
not
congratulated
me
on
my
matrimonial
prospects
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
I
did
,
George
,
when
I
wrote
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
you
?
<EOS>
well
;
I
had
forgotten
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
that
any
very
strong
congratulatory
tone
is
necessary
.
<EOS>
As
things
go
,
perhaps
it
may
be
as
well
for
all
of
us
,
and
that
's
about
the
best
that
can
be
said
for
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
George
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
see
I
'm
not
romantic
,
Kate
,
as
you
are
.
<EOS>
Half
a
dozen
children
with
a
small
income
do
not
generally
present
themselves
as
being
desirable
to
men
who
wish
to
push
their
way
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
you
have
always
longed
to
make
her
your
wife
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
anything
of
the
kind
.
<EOS>
You
have
always
been
under
a
match
-
making
hallucination
on
that
point
.
<EOS>
But
in
this
case
you
have
been
so
far
successful
,
and
are
entitled
to
your
triumph
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
want
any
triumph
;
you
ought
to
know
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
'll
tell
you
what
I
do
want
,
Kate
.
<EOS>
I
want
some
money
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Then
he
paused
,
but
as
she
did
not
answer
immediately
,
he
was
obliged
to
go
on
speaking
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
not
at
all
sure
that
I
have
not
been
wrong
in
making
this
attempt
to
get
into
Parliament
,
 
that
I
'm
not
struggling
to
pick
fruit
which
is
above
my
reach
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
say
that
,
George
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
,
but
I
ca
n't
help
feeling
it
.
<EOS>
I
need
hardly
tell
you
that
I
am
ready
to
risk
anything
of
my
own
.
<EOS>
If
I
know
myself
I
would
toss
up
to
-
morrow
,
or
for
the
matter
of
that
to
-
day
,
between
the
gallows
and
a
seat
in
the
House
.
<EOS>
But
I
can
not
go
on
with
this
contest
by
risking
what
is
merely
my
own
.
<EOS>
Money
,
for
immediate
use
,
I
have
none
left
,
and
my
neck
,
though
I
were
ever
so
willing
to
risk
it
,
is
of
no
service
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Whatever
I
have
can
be
yours
to
-
morrow
,
"
said
Kate
,
in
a
hesitating
voice
,
which
too
plainly
pronounced
her
misery
as
she
made
the
offer
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
refrain
herself
from
making
it
.
<EOS>
Though
her
grandfather
's
threat
was
ringing
in
her
ears
,
 
though
she
knew
that
she
might
be
ruining
her
brother
by
proposing
such
a
loan
,
she
had
no
alternative
.
<EOS>
When
her
brother
told
her
of
his
want
of
money
,
she
could
not
abstain
from
tendering
to
him
the
use
of
what
was
her
own
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
"
said
he
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
not
take
your
money
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
would
not
scruple
,
if
you
knew
how
welcome
you
are
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
At
any
rate
,
I
shall
not
take
it
.
<EOS>
I
should
not
think
it
right
.
<EOS>
All
that
you
have
would
only
just
suffice
for
my
present
wants
,
and
I
should
not
choose
to
make
you
a
beggar
.
<EOS>
There
would
,
moreover
,
be
a
difficulty
about
readjusting
the
payment
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
would
be
no
difficulty
,
because
no
one
need
be
consulted
but
us
two
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
not
think
it
right
,
and
therefore
let
there
be
an
end
of
it
,
"
said
George
in
a
tone
of
voice
which
had
in
it
something
of
magniloquence
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
it
you
wish
then
?
"
said
Kate
,
who
knew
too
well
what
he
did
wish
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
explain
to
you
.
<EOS>
When
Alice
and
I
are
married
,
of
course
there
will
be
a
settlement
made
on
her
,
and
as
we
are
both
the
grandchildren
of
the
old
squire
<EOS>
I
shall
propose
that
the
Vavasor
property
shall
be
hers
for
life
in
the
event
of
her
outliving
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
said
Kate
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
if
this
be
done
,
there
can
be
no
harm
in
my
forestalling
some
of
her
property
,
which
,
under
the
circumstances
of
such
a
settlement
,
would
of
course
become
mine
when
we
are
married
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
the
squire
might
leave
the
property
to
whom
he
pleases
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
know
very
well
that
he
wo
n't
,
at
any
rate
,
leave
it
out
of
the
family
.
<EOS>
In
fact
,
he
would
only
be
too
glad
to
consent
to
such
an
agreement
as
that
I
have
proposed
,
because
he
would
thereby
rob
me
of
all
power
in
the
matter
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
that
could
not
be
done
till
you
are
married
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Look
here
,
Kate
;
 
do
n't
you
make
difficulties
.
"
<EOS>
And
now
,
as
he
looked
at
her
,
the
cicature
on
his
face
seemed
to
open
and
yawn
at
her
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
mean
to
say
that
you
wo
n't
help
me
,
do
say
so
,
and
I
will
go
back
to
London
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
do
anything
in
my
power
to
help
you
,
 
<EOS>
that
was
not
wrong
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
anybody
could
say
as
much
as
that
.
<EOS>
That
is
not
much
of
an
offer
if
you
are
to
keep
to
yourself
the
power
of
deciding
what
is
wrong
.
<EOS>
Will
you
write
to
Alice
,
 
or
better
still
,
go
to
her
,
and
explain
that
I
want
the
money
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
can
I
go
to
London
now
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
can
do
it
very
well
,
if
you
choose
.
<EOS>
But
if
that
be
too
much
,
then
write
to
her
.
<EOS>
It
will
come
much
better
from
you
than
from
me
;
write
to
her
,
and
explain
that
I
must
pay
in
advance
the
expenses
of
this
contest
,
and
that
I
can
not
look
for
success
unless
I
do
so
.
<EOS>
I
did
not
think
that
the
demand
would
come
so
quick
on
me
;
but
they
know
that
I
am
not
a
man
of
capital
,
and
therefore
I
can
not
expect
them
to
carry
on
the
fight
for
me
,
unless
they
know
that
the
money
is
sure
.
<EOS>
Scruby
has
been
bitten
two
or
three
times
by
these
metropolitan
fellows
,
and
he
is
determined
that
he
will
not
be
bitten
again
.
"
<EOS>
Then
he
paused
for
Kate
to
speak
.
  
<EOS>
"
George
,
"
she
said
,
slowly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
you
would
try
any
other
scheme
but
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
no
other
scheme
!
<EOS>
That
's
so
like
a
woman
;
 
to
quarrel
with
the
only
plan
that
is
practicable
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
you
ought
to
take
Alice
's
money
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Kate
,
you
must
allow
me
to
be
the
best
judge
of
what
I
ought
to
do
,
and
what
I
ought
not
to
do
.
<EOS>
Alice
herself
understands
the
matter
perfectly
.
<EOS>
She
knows
that
I
can
not
obtain
this
position
,
which
is
as
desirable
for
her
as
it
is
for
me
 
"
  
"
And
for
me
as
much
as
for
either
,
"
said
Kate
,
interrupting
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Very
well
.
<EOS>
Alice
,
I
say
,
knows
that
I
can
not
do
this
without
money
,
and
has
offered
the
assistance
which
I
want
.
<EOS>
I
would
rather
that
you
should
tell
her
how
much
I
want
,
and
that
I
want
it
now
,
than
that
I
should
do
so
.
<EOS>
That
is
all
.
<EOS>
If
you
are
half
the
woman
that
I
take
you
to
be
,
you
will
understand
this
well
enough
.
"
  
<EOS>
Kate
did
understand
it
well
enough
.
<EOS>
She
was
quite
awake
to
the
fact
that
her
brother
was
ashamed
of
the
thing
he
was
about
to
do
,
 
so
much
ashamed
of
it
that
he
was
desirous
of
using
her
voice
instead
of
his
own
.
<EOS>
"
I
want
you
to
write
to
her
quite
at
once
,
"
he
continued
;
"
since
you
seem
to
think
that
it
is
not
worth
while
to
take
the
trouble
of
a
journey
to
London
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
no
question
about
the
trouble
,
"
said
Kate
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
walk
to
London
to
get
the
money
for
you
,
if
that
were
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
think
that
Alice
will
refuse
to
lend
it
me
?
"
<EOS>
said
he
,
looking
into
her
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
that
she
would
not
,
but
I
think
that
you
ought
not
to
take
it
from
her
.
<EOS>
There
seems
to
me
to
be
something
sacred
about
property
that
belongs
to
the
girl
you
are
going
to
marry
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
there
is
anything
on
earth
<EOS>
I
hate
,
"
said
George
,
walking
about
the
room
,
"
it
is
romance
.
<EOS>
If
you
keep
it
for
reading
in
your
bedroom
,
it
's
all
very
well
for
those
who
like
it
,
but
when
it
comes
to
be
mixed
up
with
one
's
business
it
plays
the
devil
.
<EOS>
If
you
would
only
sift
what
you
have
said
,
you
would
see
what
nonsense
it
is
.
<EOS>
Alice
and
I
are
to
be
man
and
wife
.
<EOS>
All
our
interests
,
and
all
our
money
,
and
our
station
in
life
,
whatever
it
may
be
,
are
to
be
joint
property
.
<EOS>
And
yet
she
is
the
last
person
in
the
world
to
whom
I
ought
to
go
for
money
to
improve
her
prospects
as
well
as
my
own
.
<EOS>
That
's
what
you
call
delicacy
.
<EOS>
I
call
it
infernal
nonsense
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
what
I
'll
do
,
George
.
<EOS>
I
'll
ask
Aunt
Greenow
to
lend
you
the
money
,
 
or
to
lend
it
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
believe
she
'd
give
me
a
shilling
.
<EOS>
Moreover
,
I
want
it
quite
immediately
,
and
the
time
taken
up
in
letter
-
writing
and
negotiations
would
be
fatal
to
me
.
<EOS>
If
you
wo
n't
apply
to
Alice
,
I
must
.
<EOS>
I
want
you
to
tell
me
whether
you
will
oblige
me
in
this
matter
.
"
  
<EOS>
Kate
was
still
hesitating
as
to
her
answer
,
when
there
came
a
knock
at
the
door
,
and
a
little
crumpled
note
was
brought
up
to
her
.
<EOS>
A
boy
had
just
come
with
it
across
the
fell
from
Vavasor
Hall
,
and
Kate
,
as
soon
as
she
saw
her
name
on
the
outside
,
knew
that
it
was
from
her
grandfather
.
<EOS>
It
was
as
follows
:
    
<EOS>
"
If
George
wishes
to
come
to
the
Hall
,
let
him
come
.
<EOS>
If
he
chooses
to
tell
me
that
he
regrets
his
conduct
to
me
,
I
will
see
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
it
?
"
said
George
.
<EOS>
Then
Kate
put
the
note
into
her
brother
's
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
do
nothing
of
the
kind
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
What
good
should
I
get
by
going
to
the
old
man
's
house
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Every
good
,
"
said
Kate
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
do
n't
go
now
you
never
can
do
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Never
till
it
's
my
own
,
"
said
George
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
show
him
that
you
are
determined
to
be
at
variance
with
him
,
it
never
will
be
your
own
;
 
unless
,
indeed
,
it
should
some
day
come
to
you
as
part
of
Alice
's
fortune
.
<EOS>
Think
of
it
,
George
;
you
would
not
like
to
receive
everything
from
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
walked
about
the
room
,
muttering
maledictions
between
his
teeth
and
balancing
,
as
best
he
was
able
at
such
a
moment
,
his
pride
against
his
profit
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
n't
answered
my
question
,
"
said
he
.
<EOS>
"
If
I
go
to
the
Hall
,
will
you
write
to
Alice
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
No
,
George
<EOS>
;
I
can
not
write
to
Alice
asking
her
for
the
money
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
wo
n't
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
could
not
bring
myself
to
do
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
,
Kate
,
you
and
my
grandfather
may
work
together
for
the
future
.
<EOS>
You
may
get
him
to
leave
you
the
place
<EOS>
if
you
have
skill
enough
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
as
undeserved
a
reproach
as
any
woman
ever
encountered
,
"
said
Kate
,
standing
her
ground
boldly
before
him
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
If
you
have
either
heart
or
conscience
,
you
will
feel
that
it
is
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
not
much
troubled
with
either
one
or
the
other
,
I
fancy
.
<EOS>
Things
are
being
brought
to
such
a
pass
with
me
that
I
am
better
without
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
take
my
money
,
George
;
just
for
the
present
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
.
<EOS>
I
have
n't
much
conscience
;
but
I
have
a
little
left
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
let
me
write
to
Mrs.
Greenow
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
the
slightest
objection
;
but
it
will
be
of
no
use
whatsoever
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
do
so
,
at
any
rate
.
<EOS>
And
now
will
you
come
to
the
Hall
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
To
beg
that
old
fool
's
pardon
?
<EOS>
No
;
I
wo
n't
.
<EOS>
In
the
mood
I
am
in
at
present
,
I
could
n't
do
it
.
<EOS>
I
should
only
anger
him
worse
than
ever
.
<EOS>
Tell
him
that
I
've
business
which
calls
me
back
to
London
at
once
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
thousand
pities
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
ca
n't
be
helped
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
may
make
so
great
a
difference
to
you
for
your
whole
life
!
"
urged
Kate
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
tell
you
what
I
'll
do
,
"
said
George
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
go
to
Vavasor
and
put
up
with
the
old
squire
's
insolence
,
if
you
'll
make
this
application
for
me
to
Alice
.
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
whether
it
occurred
to
him
that
his
sister
desired
his
presence
at
the
Hall
solely
on
his
own
behalf
.
<EOS>
The
same
idea
certainly
did
not
occur
to
Kate
.
<EOS>
She
hesitated
,
feeling
that
she
would
almost
do
anything
to
achieve
a
reconciliation
between
her
grandfather
and
her
brother
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
'll
let
me
write
to
Aunt
Greenow
first
,
"
said
she
.
<EOS>
"
It
will
take
only
two
days
,
 
or
at
the
most
three
?
"
  
<EOS>
To
this
George
consented
as
though
he
were
yielding
a
great
deal
;
and
Kate
,
with
a
sore
conscience
,
with
a
full
knowledge
that
she
was
undertaking
to
do
wrong
,
promised
that
she
would
apply
to
Alice
for
her
money
,
if
sufficient
funds
should
not
be
forthcoming
from
Mrs.
Greenow
.
<EOS>
Thereupon
,
George
graciously
consented
to
proceed
to
his
bedroom
,
and
put
together
his
clothes
with
a
view
to
his
visit
to
the
Hall
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
thank
Providence
,
Kate
,
that
circumstances
make
it
impossible
for
me
to
stay
above
two
days
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
linen
to
last
me
longer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
'll
manage
that
for
you
at
the
Hall
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
you
wo
n't
do
anything
of
the
kind
.
<EOS>
And
look
,
Kate
,
when
I
make
that
excuse
do
n't
you
offer
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
I
will
stay
there
over
to
-
morrow
night
,
and
shall
go
into
Kendal
early
,
so
as
to
catch
the
express
train
up
on
Thursday
morning
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
throw
me
over
by
any
counter
proposition
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Then
they
started
together
in
the
car
,
and
very
few
words
were
said
till
they
reached
the
old
lodge
,
which
stood
at
the
entrance
to
the
place
.
<EOS>
"
Eh
,
Mr.
George
;
be
that
you
?
"
said
the
old
woman
,
who
came
out
to
swing
back
for
them
the
broken
gate
.
<EOS>
"
A
sight
of
you
is
good
for
sair
een
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
the
same
welcome
that
the
inn
-
keeper
had
given
him
,
and
equally
sincere
.
<EOS>
George
had
never
made
himself
popular
about
the
place
,
but
he
was
the
heir
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
you
had
better
go
into
the
drawing
-
room
,
"
said
Kate
;
"
while
I
go
to
my
grandfather
.
<EOS>
You
wo
n't
find
a
fire
there
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Manage
it
how
you
please
;
but
do
n't
keep
me
in
the
cold
very
long
.
<EOS>
Heavens
,
what
a
country
house
!
<EOS>
The
middle
of
January
,
and
no
fires
in
the
room
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
remember
,
George
,
when
you
see
him
you
must
say
that
you
regret
that
you
ever
displeased
him
.
<EOS>
Now
that
you
are
here
,
do
n't
let
there
be
any
further
misunderstanding
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
very
probable
that
there
will
be
,
"
said
George
.
<EOS>
"
I
only
hope
he
'll
let
me
have
the
old
horse
to
take
me
back
to
Shap
if
there
is
.
<EOS>
There
he
is
at
the
front
door
,
so
I
sha
n't
have
to
go
into
the
room
without
a
fire
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
old
man
was
standing
at
the
hall
steps
when
the
car
drove
up
,
as
though
to
welcome
his
grandson
.
<EOS>
He
put
out
his
hand
to
help
Kate
down
the
steps
,
keeping
his
eye
all
the
time
on
George
's
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
you
've
come
back
,
"
the
squire
said
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
;
 
I
've
come
back
,
like
the
prodigal
son
in
the
parable
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
prodigal
son
was
contrite
.
<EOS>
I
hope
you
are
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Pretty
well
for
that
,
sir
.
<EOS>
I
'm
sorry
there
has
been
any
quarrel
,
and
all
that
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Go
in
,
"
said
the
squire
,
very
angrily
.
<EOS>
"
Go
in
.
<EOS>
To
expect
anything
gracious
from
you
would
be
to
expect
pearls
from
swine
.
<EOS>
Go
in
.
"
  
<EOS>
George
went
in
,
shrugging
his
shoulders
as
his
eyes
met
his
sister
's
.
<EOS>
It
was
in
this
fashion
that
the
reconciliation
took
place
between
Squire
Vavasor
and
his
heir
.
   
<EOS>
Mr.
Cheesacre
's
Hospitality
.
 
<EOS>
As
the
winter
wore
itself
away
,
Mr.
Cheesacre
,
happy
as
he
was
amidst
the
sports
of
Norfolk
,
and
prosperous
as
he
might
be
with
the
augean
spoils
of
Oileymead
,
fretted
himself
with
an
intense
anxiety
to
bring
to
a
close
<EOS>
that
affair
which
he
had
on
his
hands
with
the
widow
Greenow
.
<EOS>
There
were
two
special
dangers
which
disturbed
him
.
<EOS>
She
would
give
herself
and
all
her
money
to
that
adventurer
,
Bellfield
;
or
else
she
would
spend
her
own
money
so
fast
before
he
got
hold
upon
it
,
that
the
prize
would
be
greatly
damaged
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
 
---
if
she
has
n't
been
and
set
up
a
carriage
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
to
himself
one
day
,
as
standing
on
the
pavement
of
Tombland
,
in
Norwich
,
he
saw
Mrs.
Greenow
issue
forth
from
the
Close
in
a
private
brougham
,
accompanied
by
one
of
the
Fairstairs
girls
.
<EOS>
"
She
's
been
and
set
up
her
carriage
as
sure
as
my
name
's
Cheesacre
!
"
  
<EOS>
Whatever
reason
he
might
have
to
fear
the
former
danger
,
we
may
declare
that
he
had
none
whatever
as
to
the
latter
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Greenow
knew
what
she
was
doing
with
her
money
as
well
as
any
lady
in
England
.
<EOS>
The
private
carriage
was
only
a
hired
brougham
taken
by
the
month
,
and
as
to
that
boy
in
buttons
whom
she
had
lately
established
,
why
should
she
not
keep
a
young
servant
,
and
call
him
a
page
,
if
it
gave
her
any
comfort
to
do
so
?
<EOS>
If
Mr.
Cheesacre
had
also
known
that
she
had
lent
the
Fairstairs
family
fifty
pounds
to
help
them
through
with
some
difficulty
which
Joe
had
encountered
with
the
Norwich
tradespeople
,
he
would
have
been
beside
himself
with
dismay
.
<EOS>
He
desired
to
obtain
the
prize
unmutilated
,
 
in
all
its
fair
proportions
.
<EOS>
Any
such
clippings
he
regarded
as
robberies
against
himself
.
  
<EOS>
But
he
feared
Bellfield
more
than
he
feared
the
brougham
.
<EOS>
That
all
is
fair
in
love
and
war
was
no
doubt
,
at
this
period
,
Captain
Bellfield
's
maxim
,
and
we
can
only
trust
that
he
found
in
it
some
consolation
,
or
ease
to
his
conscience
,
in
regard
to
the
monstrous
lies
which
he
told
his
friend
.
<EOS>
In
war
,
no
doubt
,
all
stratagems
are
fair
.
<EOS>
The
one
general
is
quite
justified
in
making
the
other
believe
that
he
is
far
to
the
right
,
when
in
truth
he
is
turning
his
enemy
's
left
flank
.
<EOS>
If
successful
,
he
will
be
put
upon
a
pedestal
for
his
clever
deceit
,
and
crowned
with
laurels
because
of
his
lie
.
<EOS>
If
Bellfield
could
only
be
successful
,
and
achieve
for
himself
the
mastery
over
those
forty
thousand
pounds
,
the
world
would
forgive
him
and
place
,
on
his
brow
also
,
some
not
uncomfortable
crown
.
<EOS>
In
the
mean
time
,
his
stratagems
were
as
deep
and
his
lies
as
profound
as
those
of
any
general
.
  
<EOS>
It
must
not
be
supposed
that
Cheesacre
ever
believed
him
.
<EOS>
In
the
first
place
,
he
knew
that
Bellfield
was
not
a
man
to
be
believed
in
any
way
.
<EOS>
Had
he
not
been
living
on
lies
for
the
last
ten
years
?
<EOS>
But
then
a
man
may
lie
in
such
a
way
as
to
deceive
,
though
no
one
believe
him
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Cheesacre
was
kept
in
an
agony
of
doubt
while
Captain
Bellfield
occupied
his
lodgings
in
Norwich
.
<EOS>
He
fee'd
Jeannette
liberally
.
<EOS>
He
even
fee'd
Charlie
Fairstairs
,
 
Miss
Fairstairs
<EOS>
I
mean
,
 
with
gloves
,
and
chickens
from
Oileymead
,
so
that
he
might
know
whether
that
kite
fluttered
about
his
dovecoat
,
and
of
what
nature
were
the
flutterings
.
<EOS>
He
went
even
further
than
this
,
and
fee'd
the
Captain
himself
,
 
binding
him
down
not
to
flutter
as
value
given
in
return
for
such
fees
.
<EOS>
He
attempted
even
to
fee
the
widow
,
 
cautioning
her
against
the
fluttering
,
as
he
tendered
to
her
,
on
his
knees
,
a
brooch
as
big
as
a
breast
-
plate
.
<EOS>
She
waved
aside
the
breast
-
plate
,
declaring
that
the
mourning
ring
which
contained
poor
Greenow
's
final
grey
lock
of
hair
,
was
the
last
article
from
a
jeweller
's
shop
which
should
ever
find
a
place
about
her
person
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
she
declared
that
Captain
Bellfield
was
nothing
to
her
;
Mr.
Cheesacre
need
have
no
fears
in
that
quarter
.
<EOS>
But
then
,
she
added
,
neither
was
he
to
have
any
hope
.
<EOS>
Her
affections
were
all
buried
under
the
cold
sod
.
<EOS>
This
was
harassing
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
though
no
absolute
satisfaction
was
to
be
attained
in
the
wooing
of
Mrs.
Greenow
,
there
was
a
pleasantness
in
the
occupation
which
ought
to
have
reconciled
her
suitors
to
their
destiny
.
<EOS>
With
most
ladies
,
when
a
gentleman
has
been
on
his
knees
before
one
of
them
in
the
morning
,
with
outspoken
protestations
of
love
,
with
clearly
defined
proffers
of
marriage
,
with
a
minute
inventory
of
the
offerer
's
worldly
wealth
,
 
down
even
to
the
"
mahogany
-
furnitured
"
bed
-
chambers
,
as
was
the
case
with
Mr.
Cheesacre
,
and
when
all
these
overtures
have
been
peremptorily
declined
,
 
a
gentleman
in
such
a
case
,
I
say
,
would
generally
feel
some
awkwardness
in
sitting
down
to
tea
with
the
lady
at
the
close
of
such
a
performance
.
<EOS>
But
with
Mrs.
Greenow
there
was
no
such
awkwardness
.
<EOS>
After
an
hour
's
work
of
the
nature
above
described
she
would
play
the
hostess
with
a
genial
hospitality
,
that
eased
off
all
the
annoyance
of
disappointment
;
and
then
at
the
end
of
the
evening
,
she
would
accept
a
squeeze
of
the
hand
,
a
good
,
palpable
,
long
-
protracted
squeeze
,
with
that
sort
of
"
do
n't
;
 
have
done
now
,
"
by
which
Irish
young
ladies
allure
their
lovers
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Cheesacre
,
on
such
occasions
,
would
leave
the
Close
,
swearing
that
she
should
be
his
on
the
next
market
-
day
,
 
or
at
any
rate
,
on
the
next
Saturday
.
<EOS>
Then
,
on
the
Monday
,
tidings
would
reach
him
that
Bellfield
had
passed
all
Sunday
afternoon
with
his
lady
-
love
,
 
Bellfield
,
to
whom
he
had
lent
five
pounds
on
purpose
that
he
might
be
enabled
to
spend
that
very
Sunday
with
some
officers
of
the
Suffolk
volunteers
at
Ipswich
.
<EOS>
And
hearing
this
,
he
would
walk
out
among
those
rich
heaps
,
at
the
back
of
his
farmyard
,
uttering
deep
curses
against
the
falsehood
of
men
and
the
fickleness
of
women
.
  
<EOS>
Driven
to
despair
,
he
at
last
resolved
to
ask
Bellfield
to
come
to
Oileymead
for
a
month
.
<EOS>
That
drilling
at
Norwich
,
or
the
part
of
it
which
was
supposed
to
be
profitable
,
was
wearing
itself
out
.
<EOS>
Funds
were
low
with
the
Captain
,
 
as
he
did
not
scruple
to
tell
his
friend
Cheesacre
,
and
he
accepted
the
invitation
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
mount
you
with
the
harriers
,
old
fellow
,
"
Cheesacre
had
said
;
"
and
give
you
a
little
shooting
.
<EOS>
Only
I
wo
n't
have
you
go
out
when
I
'm
not
with
you
.
"
<EOS>
Bellfield
agreed
,
Each
of
them
understood
the
nature
of
the
bargain
;
though
Bellfield
,
I
think
,
had
somewhat
the
clearer
understanding
in
the
matter
.
<EOS>
He
would
not
be
so
near
the
widow
as
he
had
been
at
Norwich
,
but
he
would
not
be
less
near
than
his
kind
host
.
<EOS>
And
his
host
would
no
doubt
watch
him
closely
;
 
but
then
he
also
could
watch
his
host
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
railway
station
not
two
miles
from
Oileymead
,
and
the
journey
thence
into
Norwich
was
one
of
half
an
hour
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Cheesacre
would
doubtless
be
very
jealous
of
such
journeys
,
but
with
all
his
jealousy
he
could
not
prevent
them
.
<EOS>
And
then
,
in
regard
to
this
arrangement
,
Mr.
Cheesacre
paid
the
piper
,
whereas
Captain
Bellfield
paid
nothing
.
<EOS>
Would
it
not
be
sweet
to
him
if
he
could
carry
off
his
friend
's
prize
from
under
the
very
eaves
of
his
friend
's
house
?
  
<EOS>
And
Mrs.
Greenow
also
understood
the
arrangement
.
<EOS>
"
Going
to
Oileymead
;
are
you
?
"
<EOS>
she
said
when
Captain
Bellfield
came
to
tell
her
of
his
departure
.
<EOS>
Charlie
Fairstairs
was
with
her
,
so
that
the
Captain
could
not
utilize
the
moment
in
any
special
way
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
quite
delightful
,
"
continued
the
widow
,
"
to
see
how
fond
you
two
gentlemen
are
of
each
other
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
gentlemen
always
like
to
go
best
to
gentlemen
's
houses
where
there
are
no
ladies
,
"
said
Charlie
Fairstairs
,
whose
career
in
life
had
not
as
yet
been
satisfactory
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
As
for
that
,
"
said
Bellfield
,
"
I
wish
with
all
my
heart
that
dear
old
Cheesy
would
get
a
wife
.
<EOS>
He
wants
a
wife
badly
,
if
ever
a
man
did
,
with
all
that
house
full
of
blankets
and
crockery
.
<EOS>
Why
do
n't
you
set
your
cap
at
him
,
Miss
Fairstairs
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
;
 
at
a
farmer
!
"
said
Charlie
who
was
particularly
anxious
that
her
dear
friend
,
Mrs.
Greenow
,
should
not
marry
Mr.
Cheesacre
,
and
who
weakly
thought
to
belittle
him
accordingly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Give
him
my
kind
love
,
"
said
Mrs.
Greenow
,
thereby
resenting
the
impotent
interference
.
<EOS>
"
And
look
here
,
Captain
Bellfield
,
suppose
you
both
dine
with
me
next
Saturday
.
<EOS>
He
always
comes
in
on
Saturday
,
and
you
might
as
well
come
too
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Captain
Bellfield
declared
that
he
would
only
be
too
happy
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
Charlie
shall
come
to
set
her
cap
at
Mr.
Cheesacre
,
"
said
the
widow
,
turning
a
soft
and
gracious
eye
on
the
Captain
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
happy
to
come
,
"
 
said
Charlie
,
quite
delighted
;
"
but
not
with
that
object
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Cheesacre
is
very
respectable
,
I
'm
sure
.
<EOS>
"
Charlie
's
mother
had
been
the
daughter
of
a
small
squire
who
had
let
his
land
to
tenants
,
and
she
was
,
therefore
,
justified
by
circumstances
in
looking
down
upon
a
farmer
.
  
<EOS>
The
matter
was
so
settled
,
 
pending
the
consent
of
Mr.
Cheesacre
;
and
Bellfield
went
out
to
Oileymead
.
<EOS>
He
knew
the
ways
of
the
house
,
and
was
not
surprised
to
find
himself
left
alone
till
after
dusk
;
nor
was
he
much
surprised
when
he
learned
that
he
was
not
put
into
one
of
the
mahogany
-
furnitured
chambers
,
but
into
a
back
room
looking
over
the
farm
-
yard
in
which
there
was
no
fire
-
place
.
<EOS>
The
Captain
had
already
endured
some
of
the
evils
of
poverty
,
and
could
have
put
up
with
this
easily
had
nothing
been
said
about
it
.
<EOS>
As
it
was
,
Cheesacre
brought
the
matter
forward
,
and
apologized
,
and
made
the
thing
difficult
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
old
fellow
,
"
he
said
,
"
there
are
the
rooms
,
and
of
course
they
're
empty
.
<EOS>
But
it
's
such
a
bore
hauling
out
all
the
things
and
putting
up
the
curtains
.
<EOS>
You
'll
be
very
snug
where
you
are
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
do
very
well
,
"
said
Bellfield
rather
sulkily
.
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
you
'll
do
very
well
.
<EOS>
It
's
the
warmest
room
in
the
house
in
one
way
.
<EOS>
"
He
did
not
say
in
what
way
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
the
near
neighbourhood
of
the
stables
may
have
had
a
warming
effect
.
  
<EOS>
Bellfield
did
not
like
it
;
but
what
is
a
poor
man
to
do
under
such
circumstances
?
<EOS>
So
he
went
up
-
stairs
and
washed
his
hands
before
dinner
in
the
room
without
a
fire
-
place
,
flattering
himself
that
he
would
yet
be
even
with
his
friend
Cheesacre
.
  
<EOS>
They
dined
together
not
in
the
best
humour
,
and
after
dinner
they
sat
down
to
enjoy
themselves
with
pipes
and
brandy
and
water
.
<EOS>
Bellfield
,
having
a
taste
for
everything
that
was
expensive
,
would
have
preferred
cigars
;
but
his
friend
put
none
upon
the
table
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Cheesacre
,
though
he
could
spend
his
money
liberally
when
occasion
required
such
spending
,
knew
well
the
value
of
domestic
economy
.
<EOS>
He
was
n't
going
to
put
himself
out
,
as
he
called
it
,
for
Bellfield
!
<EOS>
What
was
good
enough
for
himself
was
good
enough
for
Bellfield
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
beggar
,
you
know
;
just
a
regular
beggar
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
as
he
was
betrayed
into
saying
to
Mrs.
Greenow
on
some
occasion
just
at
this
period
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Poor
fellow
!
<EOS>
He
only
wants
money
to
make
him
almost
perfect
,
"
Mrs.
Greenow
had
answered
;
 
and
Mr.
Cheesacre
had
felt
that
he
had
made
a
mistake
.
  
<EOS>
Both
the
men
became
talkative
,
if
not
good
-
humoured
,
under
the
effects
of
the
brandy
and
water
,
and
the
Captain
then
communicated
Mrs.
Greenow
's
invitation
to
Mr.
Cheesacre
.
<EOS>
He
had
had
his
doubts
as
to
the
propriety
of
doing
so
,
 
thinking
that
perhaps
it
might
be
to
his
advantage
to
forget
the
message
.
<EOS>
But
he
reflected
that
he
was
at
any
rate
a
match
for
Cheesacre
when
they
were
present
together
,
and
finally
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
message
should
be
delivered
.
<EOS>
"
I
had
to
go
and
just
wish
her
goodbye
you
know
,
"
he
said
apologetically
,
as
he
finished
his
little
speech
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
see
that
at
all
,
"
said
Cheesacre
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
my
dear
fellow
,
how
foolishly
jealous
you
are
.
<EOS>
If
I
were
to
be
downright
uncivil
to
her
,
as
you
would
have
me
be
,
it
would
only
call
attention
to
the
thing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
not
a
bit
jealous
.
<EOS>
A
man
who
sits
upon
his
own
ground
as
I
do
has
n't
any
occasion
to
be
jealous
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
what
your
own
ground
has
to
do
with
it
,
 
but
we
'll
let
that
pass
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
has
a
great
deal
to
do
with
it
.
<EOS>
If
a
man
does
intend
to
marry
he
ought
to
have
things
comfortable
about
him
;
unless
he
wants
to
live
on
his
wife
,
which
I
look
upon
as
about
the
meanest
thing
a
man
can
do
.
<EOS>
By
George
,
I
'd
sooner
break
stones
than
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
This
was
hard
for
any
captain
to
bear
,
 
even
for
Captain
Bellfield
;
but
he
did
bear
it
,
 
looking
forward
to
revenge
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
no
pleasing
you
,
I
know
,
"
said
he
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
there
's
the
fact
.
<EOS>
I
went
to
say
goodbye
to
her
,
and
she
asked
me
to
give
you
that
message
.
<EOS>
Shall
we
go
or
not
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Cheesacre
sat
for
some
time
silent
,
blowing
out
huge
clouds
of
smoke
while
he
meditated
a
little
plan
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
tell
you
what
it
is
,
Bellfield
,
"
he
said
at
last
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
's
nothing
to
you
,
and
if
you
wo
n't
mind
it
,
I
'll
go
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jones
shall
get
you
anything
you
like
for
dinner
,
 
and
,
 
and
 
<EOS>
I
'll
stand
you
a
bottle
of
the
"
34
port
!
"
  
<EOS>
But
Captain
Bellfield
was
not
going
to
put
up
with
this
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
sold
himself
altogether
to
work
Mr.
Cheesacre
's
will
.
"
<EOS>
No
,
old
fellow
,
"
said
he
;
"
that
cock
wo
n't
fight
.
<EOS>
She
has
asked
me
to
dine
with
her
on
Saturday
,
and
I
mean
to
go
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
intend
that
she
shall
think
that
I
'm
afraid
of
her
,
 
or
of
you
either
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
;
 
do
n't
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
do
n't
,
"
said
the
Captain
stoutly
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
you
'd
pay
me
some
of
that
money
you
owe
me
,
"
said
Cheesacre
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
So
I
will
,
 
when
I
've
married
the
widow
.
<EOS>
Ha
,
 
ha
,
 
ha
.
"
  
Cheesacre
longed
to
turn
him
out
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
Words
to
bid
him
go
,
were
,
so
to
say
,
upon
his
tongue
.
<EOS>
But
the
man
would
only
have
taken
himself
to
Norwich
,
and
would
have
gone
without
any
embargo
upon
his
suit
;
all
their
treaties
would
then
be
at
an
end
.
"
<EOS>
She
knows
a
trick
worth
two
of
that
,
"
said
Cheesacre
at
last
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
dare
say
she
does
;
and
if
so
,
why
should
n't
I
go
and
dine
with
her
next
Saturday
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
tell
you
why
,
 
because
you
're
in
my
way
.
<EOS>
The
deuce
is
in
it
if
I
have
n't
made
the
whole
thing
clear
enough
.
<EOS>
I
've
told
you
all
my
plans
because
I
thought
you
were
my
friend
,
and
I
've
paid
you
well
to
help
me
,
too
;
and
yet
it
seems
to
me
you
'd
do
anything
in
your
power
to
throw
me
over
,
 
<EOS>
only
you
ca
n't
.

<EOS>
"
What
an
ass
you
are
,
"
said
the
Captain
after
a
pause
;
"
just
you
listen
to
me
.
<EOS>
That
scraggy
young
woman
,
Charlie
Fairstairs
,
is
to
be
there
of
course
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
know
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
that
I
do
know
.
<EOS>
She
was
present
when
the
whole
thing
was
arranged
,
and
I
heard
her
asked
,
and
heard
her
say
that
she
would
come
;
 
and
for
the
matter
of
that
I
heard
her
declare
that
she
would
n't
set
her
cap
at
you
,
because
you
're
a
farmer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
word
she
's
kind
.
<EOS>
Upon
my
word
she
is
,
"
said
Cheesacre
,
getting
very
angry
and
very
red
.
"
<EOS>
Charlie
Fairstairs
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
I
would
n't
pick
her
out
of
a
gutter
with
a
pair
of
tongs
.
<EOS>
She
ai
n't
good
enough
for
my
bailiff
,
let
alone
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
somebody
must
take
her
in
hand
on
Saturday
,
if
you
're
to
do
any
good
,
"
said
the
crafty
Bellfield
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
the
deuce
does
she
have
that
nasty
creature
there
for
?
"
said
Cheesacre
,
who
thought
it
very
hard
that
everything
should
not
be
arranged
exactly
as
he
would
desire
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
wants
a
companion
,
of
course
.
<EOS>
You
can
get
rid
of
Charlie
,
you
know
,
when
you
make
her
Mrs.
Cheesacre
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Get
rid
of
her
!
<EOS>
You
do
n't
suppose
she
'll
ever
put
her
foot
in
this
house
.
<EOS>
Not
if
I
know
it
.
<EOS>
I
've
detested
that
woman
for
the
last
ten
years
.
<EOS>
"
Cheesacre
could
forgive
no
word
of
slight
respecting
his
social
position
,
and
the
idea
of
Miss
Fairstairs
having
pretended
to
look
down
upon
him
,
galled
him
to
the
quick
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
'll
have
to
dine
with
her
at
any
rate
,
"
said
Bellfield
,
"
<EOS>
and
I
always
think
that
four
are
better
company
than
three
on
such
occasions
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Cheesacre
grunted
an
unwilling
assent
,
and
after
this
it
was
looked
upon
as
an
arranged
thing
that
they
two
should
go
into
Norwich
on
the
Saturday
together
,
and
that
they
should
both
dine
with
the
widow
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
Mrs.
Greenow
got
two
notes
,
one
from
each
of
them
,
accepting
the
invitation
.
<EOS>
Cheesacre
wrote
in
the
singular
number
,
altogether
ignoring
Captain
Bellfield
,
as
he
might
have
ignored
his
footman
<EOS>
had
he
intended
to
take
one
.
<EOS>
The
captain
condescended
to
use
the
plural
pronoun
.
<EOS>
"
We
shall
be
so
happy
to
come
,
"
said
he
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Dear
old
Cheesy
is
out
of
his
little
wits
with
delight
,
"
he
added
,
"
and
has
already
begun
to
polish
off
the
effects
of
the
farmyard
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Effects
of
the
farmyard
,
"
said
Mrs.
Greenow
aloud
,
in
Jeannette
's
hearing
,
when
she
received
the
note
.
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
well
for
Captain
Bellfield
if
he
had
a
few
such
effects
himself
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
can
give
him
enough
,
ma'am
,
"
said
Jeannette
,
"
to
make
him
a
better
man
than
Mr.
Cheesacre
any
day
.
<EOS>
And
for
a
gentleman
 
of
course
I
say
nothing
,
but
if
I
was
a
lady
,
I
know
which
should
be
the
man
for
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs.
Greenow
's
Little
Dinner
in
the
Close
.
 
<EOS>
How
deep
and
cunning
are
the
wiles
of
love
!
<EOS>
When
that
Saturday
morning
arrived
not
a
word
was
said
by
Cheesacre
to
his
rival
as
to
his
plans
for
the
day
.
<EOS>
"
You
'll
take
the
dog
-
cart
in
?
"
<EOS>
Captain
Bellfield
had
asked
overnight
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
what
I
shall
do
as
yet
,
"
replied
he
who
was
master
of
the
house
,
of
the
dog
-
cart
,
and
,
as
he
fondly
thought
,
of
the
situation
.
<EOS>
But
Bellfield
knew
that
Cheesacre
must
take
the
dog
-
cart
,
and
was
contented
.
<EOS>
His
friend
would
leave
him
behind
,
if
it
were
possible
,
but
Bellfield
would
take
care
that
it
should
not
be
possible
.
  
<EOS>
Before
breakfast
Mr.
Cheesacre
surreptitiously
carried
out
into
the
yard
a
bag
containing
all
his
apparatus
for
dressing
,
 
his
marrow
oil
for
his
hair
,
his
shirt
with
the
wondrous
worked
front
upon
an
under
-
stratum
of
pink
to
give
it
colour
,
his
shiny
boots
,
and
all
the
rest
of
the
paraphernalia
.
<EOS>
When
dining
in
Norwich
on
ordinary
occasions
,
he
simply
washed
his
hands
there
,
trusting
to
the
chambermaid
at
the
inn
to
find
him
a
comb
;
and
now
he
came
down
with
his
bag
surreptitiously
,
and
hid
it
away
in
the
back
of
the
dog
-
cart
with
secret
,
but
alas
,
not
unobserved
hands
,
hoping
that
Bellfield
would
forget
his
toilet
.
<EOS>
But
when
did
such
a
Captain
ever
forget
his
outward
man
?
<EOS>
Cheesacre
,
as
he
returned
through
the
kitchen
from
the
yard
into
the
front
hall
,
perceived
another
bag
lying
near
the
door
,
apparently
filled
almost
as
well
as
his
own
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
the
deuce
are
you
going
to
do
with
all
this
luggage
?
"
<EOS>
said
he
,
giving
the
bag
a
kick
.
  
<EOS>
"
Put
it
where
I
saw
you
putting
yours
when
I
opened
my
window
just
now
,
"
said
Bellfield
.
  
<EOS>
"
D
 
---
the
window
,
"
exclaimed
Cheesacre
,
and
then
they
sat
down
to
breakfast
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
How
you
do
hack
that
ham
about
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
ever
found
hams
yourself
you
'd
be
more
particular
in
cutting
them
.
<EOS>
"
This
was
very
bad
.
<EOS>
Even
Bellfield
could
not
bear
it
with
equanimity
,
and
feeling
unable
to
eat
the
ham
under
such
circumstances
,
made
his
breakfast
with
a
couple
of
fresh
eggs
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
did
n't
mean
to
eat
the
meat
,
why
the
mischief
did
you
cut
it
?
"
said
Cheesacre
.
  
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
word
,
Cheesacre
,
you
're
too
bad
;
 
upon
my
word
you
are
,
"
said
Bellfield
,
almost
sobbing
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
matter
now
?
"
said
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
"
Who
wants
your
ham
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
,
I
suppose
,
or
you
would
n't
cut
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
I
do
n't
;
nor
anything
else
either
that
you
've
got
.
<EOS>
It
is
n't
fair
to
ask
a
fellow
into
your
house
,
and
then
say
such
things
to
him
as
that
.
<EOS>
And
it
is
n't
what
I
've
been
accustomed
to
either
;
I
can
tell
you
that
,
Mr.
Cheesacre
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
bother
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
all
very
well
to
say
bother
,
but
I
choose
to
be
treated
like
a
gentleman
wherever
I
go
.
<EOS>
You
and
I
have
known
each
other
a
long
time
,
and
I
'd
put
up
with
more
from
you
than
from
anyone
else
;
but
 
"
  
"
Can
you
pay
me
the
money
that
you
owe
me
,
Bellfield
?
<EOS>
"
said
Cheesacre
,
looking
hard
at
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
ca
n't
,
"
said
Bellfield
;
"
not
immediately
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
eat
your
breakfast
,
and
hold
your
tongue
.
"
  
<EOS>
After
that
Captain
Bellfield
did
eat
his
breakfast
,
 
leaving
the
ham
however
untouched
,
and
did
hold
his
tongue
,
vowing
vengeance
in
his
heart
.
<EOS>
But
the
two
men
went
into
Norwich
more
amicably
together
than
they
would
have
done
<EOS>
had
there
been
no
words
between
them
.
<EOS>
Cheesacre
felt
that
he
had
trespassed
a
little
,
and
therefore
offered
the
Captain
a
cigar
as
he
seated
himself
in
the
cart
.
<EOS>
Bellfield
accepted
the
offering
,
and
smoked
the
weed
of
peace
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
"
said
Cheesacre
,
as
he
drove
into
the
Swan
yard
,
"
what
do
you
mean
to
do
with
yourself
all
day
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
go
down
to
the
quarters
,
and
look
the
fellows
up
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
All
right
.
<EOS>
But
mind
this
,
Bellfield
;
 
it
's
an
understood
thing
,
that
you
're
not
to
be
in
the
Close
before
four
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wo
n't
be
in
the
Close
before
four
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
well
.
<EOS>
That
's
understood
.
<EOS>
If
you
deceive
me
,
I
'll
not
drive
you
back
to
Oileymead
to
-
night
.
"
  
<EOS>
In
this
instance
Captain
Bellfield
had
no
intention
to
deceive
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
think
it
probable
that
he
could
do
himself
any
good
by
philandering
about
the
widow
early
in
the
day
.
<EOS>
She
would
be
engaged
with
her
dinner
and
with
an
early
toilet
.
<EOS>
Captain
Bellfield
,
moreover
,
had
learned
from
experience
that
the
first
comer
has
not
always
an
advantage
in
ladies
"
society
.
<EOS>
The
mind
of
a
woman
is
greedy
after
novelty
,
and
it
is
upon
the
stranger
,
or
upon
the
most
strange
of
her
slaves
around
her
,
that
she
often
smiles
the
sweetest
.
<EOS>
The
cathedral
clock
,
therefore
,
had
struck
four
before
Captain
Bellfield
rang
Mrs.
Greenow
's
bell
,
and
then
,
when
he
was
shown
into
the
drawing
-
room
,
he
found
Cheesacre
there
alone
,
redolent
with
the
marrow
oil
,
and
beautiful
with
the
pink
bosom
.
  
<EOS>
"
Have
n't
you
seen
her
yet
?
"
asked
the
Captain
almost
in
a
whisper
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Cheesacre
sulkily
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nor
yet
Charlie
Fairstairs
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
've
seen
nobody
,
"
said
Cheesacre
.
  
<EOS>
But
at
this
moment
he
was
compelled
to
swallow
his
anger
,
as
Mrs.
Greenow
,
accompanied
by
her
lady
guest
,
came
into
the
room
.
<EOS>
"
Whoever
would
have
expected
two
gentlemen
to
be
so
punctual
,
"
said
she
,
"
especially
on
market
-
day
!
<EOS>
"
  
"
Market
-
day
makes
no
difference
when
I
come
to
see
you
,
"
said
Cheesacre
,
putting
his
best
foot
forward
,
while
Captain
Bellfield
contented
himself
with
saying
something
civil
to
Charlie
.
<EOS>
He
would
bide
his
time
and
ride
a
waiting
race
.
  
<EOS>
The
widow
was
almost
gorgeous
in
her
weeds
.
<EOS>
I
believe
that
she
had
not
sinned
in
her
dress
against
any
of
those
canons
which
the
semi
-
ecclesiastical
authorities
on
widowhood
have
laid
down
as
to
the
outward
garments
fitted
for
gentlemen
's
relicts
.
<EOS>
The
materials
were
those
which
are
devoted
to
the
deepest
conjugal
grief
.
<EOS>
As
regarded
every
item
of
the
written
law
her
suttee
worship
was
carried
out
to
the
letter
.
<EOS>
There
was
the
widow
's
cap
,
generally
so
hideous
,
so
well
known
to
the
eyes
of
all
men
,
so
odious
to
womanhood
.
<EOS>
Let
us
hope
that
such
headgear
may
have
some
assuaging
effect
on
the
departed
spirits
of
husbands
.
<EOS>
There
was
the
dress
of
deep
,
clinging
,
melancholy
crape
,
 
of
crape
which
becomes
so
brown
and
so
rusty
,
and
which
makes
the
six
months
"
widow
seem
so
much
more
afflicted
a
creature
than
she
whose
husband
is
just
gone
,
and
whose
crape
is
therefore
new
.
<EOS>
There
were
the
trailing
weepers
,
and
the
widow
's
kerchief
pinned
close
round
her
neck
and
somewhat
tightly
over
her
bosom
.
<EOS>
But
there
was
that
of
genius
about
Mrs.
Greenow
,
that
she
had
turned
every
seeming
disadvantage
to
some
special
profit
,
and
had
so
dressed
herself
that
though
she
had
obeyed
the
law
to
the
letter
,
she
had
thrown
the
spirit
of
it
to
the
winds
.
<EOS>
Her
cap
sat
jauntily
on
her
head
,
and
showed
just
so
much
of
her
rich
brown
hair
as
to
give
her
the
appearance
of
youth
which
she
desired
.
<EOS>
Cheesacre
had
blamed
her
in
his
heart
for
her
private
carriage
,
but
she
spent
more
money
,
I
think
,
on
new
crape
than
she
did
on
her
brougham
.
<EOS>
It
never
became
brown
and
rusty
with
her
,
or
formed
itself
into
old
lumpy
folds
,
or
shaped
itself
round
her
like
a
grave
cloth
.
<EOS>
The
written
law
had
not
interdicted
crinoline
,
and
she
loomed
as
large
with
weeds
,
which
with
her
were
not
sombre
,
as
she
would
do
with
her
silks
when
the
period
of
her
probation
should
be
over
.
<EOS>
Her
weepers
were
bright
with
newness
,
and
she
would
waft
them
aside
from
her
shoulder
with
an
air
which
turned
even
them
into
auxiliaries
.
<EOS>
Her
kerchief
was
fastened
close
round
her
neck
and
close
over
her
bosom
;
but
Jeannette
well
knew
what
she
was
doing
as
she
fastened
it
,
 
and
so
did
Jeannette
's
mistress
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Greenow
would
still
talk
much
about
her
husband
,
declaring
that
her
loss
was
as
fresh
to
her
wounded
heart
,
as
though
he
,
on
whom
all
her
happiness
had
rested
,
had
left
her
only
yesterday
;
but
yet
she
mistook
her
dates
,
frequently
referring
to
the
melancholy
circumstance
,
as
having
taken
place
fifteen
months
ago
.
<EOS>
In
truth
,
however
,
Mr.
Greenow
had
been
alive
within
the
last
nine
months
,
 
as
everybody
around
her
knew
.
<EOS>
But
if
she
chose
to
forget
the
exact
day
,
why
should
her
friends
or
dependents
remind
her
of
it
?
<EOS>
No
friend
or
dependent
did
remind
her
of
it
,
and
Charlie
Fairstairs
spoke
of
the
fifteen
months
with
bold
confidence
,
 
<EOS>
false
-
tongued
little
parasite
that
she
was
.
  
<EOS>
"
Looking
well
,
"
said
the
widow
,
in
answer
to
some
outspoken
compliment
from
Mr.
Cheesacre
.
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
'm
well
enough
in
health
,
and
I
suppose
I
ought
to
be
thankful
that
it
is
so
.
<EOS>
But
if
you
had
buried
a
wife
whom
you
had
loved
within
the
last
eighteen
months
,
you
would
have
become
as
indifferent
as
I
am
to
all
that
kind
of
thing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
was
married
yet
,
"
said
Mr.
Cheesacre
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
therefore
you
know
nothing
about
it
.
<EOS>
Everything
in
the
world
is
gay
and
fresh
to
you
.
<EOS>
If
I
were
you
,
Mr.
Cheesacre
,
I
would
not
run
the
risk
.
<EOS>
It
is
hardly
worth
a
woman
's
while
,
and
I
suppose
not
a
man
's
.
<EOS>
The
sufferings
are
too
great
!
"
<EOS>
Whereupon
she
pressed
her
handkerchief
to
her
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
mean
to
try
all
the
same
,
"
said
Cheesacre
,
looking
the
lover
all
over
as
he
gazed
into
the
fair
one
's
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
that
you
may
be
successful
,
Mr.
Cheesacre
,
and
that
she
may
not
be
torn
away
from
you
early
in
life
.
<EOS>
Is
dinner
ready
,
Jeannette
?
<EOS>
That
's
well
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Cheesacre
,
will
you
give
your
arm
to
Miss
Fairstairs
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
no
doubt
as
to
Mrs.
Greenow
's
correctness
.
<EOS>
As
Captain
Bellfield
held
,
or
had
held
,
her
Majesty
's
commission
,
he
was
clearly
entitled
to
take
the
mistress
of
the
festival
down
to
dinner
.
<EOS>
But
Cheesacre
would
not
look
at
it
in
this
light
.
<EOS>
He
would
only
remember
that
he
had
paid
for
the
Captain
's
food
for
some
time
past
,
that
the
Captain
had
been
brought
into
Norwich
in
his
gig
,
that
the
Captain
owed
him
money
,
and
ought
,
so
to
say
,
to
be
regarded
as
his
property
on
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
"
I
pay
my
way
,
and
that
ought
to
give
a
man
higher
station
than
being
a
beggarly
captain
,
 
which
I
do
n't
believe
he
is
,
if
all
the
truth
was
known
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
thus
that
he
took
an
occasion
to
express
himself
to
Miss
Fairstairs
on
that
very
evening
.
"
<EOS>
Military
rank
is
always
recognised
,
"
Miss
Fairstairs
had
replied
,
taking
Mr.
Cheesacre
's
remarks
as
a
direct
slight
upon
herself
.
<EOS>
He
had
taken
her
down
to
dinner
,
and
had
then
come
to
her
complaining
that
he
had
been
injured
in
being
called
upon
to
do
so
!
<EOS>
"
If
you
were
a
magistrate
,
Mr.
Cheesacre
,
you
would
have
rank
;
but
I
believe
you
are
not
.
"
<EOS>
Charlie
Fairstairs
knew
well
what
she
was
about
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Cheesacre
had
striven
much
to
get
his
name
put
upon
the
commission
of
the
peace
,
but
had
failed
.
"
<EOS>
Nasty
,
scraggy
old
cat
,
"
Cheesacre
said
to
himself
,
as
he
turned
away
from
her
.
  
<EOS>
But
Bellfield
gained
little
by
taking
the
widow
down
.
<EOS>
He
and
Cheesacre
were
placed
at
the
top
and
bottom
of
the
table
,
so
that
they
might
do
the
work
of
carving
;
and
the
ladies
sat
at
the
sides
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Greenow
's
hospitality
was
very
good
.
<EOS>
The
dinner
was
exactly
what
a
dinner
ought
to
be
for
four
persons
.
<EOS>
There
was
soup
,
fish
,
a
cutlet
,
a
roast
fowl
,
and
some
game
.
<EOS>
Jeannette
waited
at
table
nimbly
,
and
the
thing
could
not
have
been
done
better
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Greenow
's
appetite
was
not
injured
by
her
grief
,
and
she
so
far
repressed
for
the
time
all
remembrance
of
her
sorrow
as
to
enable
her
to
play
the
kind
hostess
to
perfection
.
<EOS>
Under
her
immediate
eye
Cheesacre
was
forced
into
apparent
cordiality
with
his
friend
Bellfield
,
and
the
Captain
himself
took
the
good
things
which
the
gods
provided
with
thankful
good
-
humour
.
  
<EOS>
Nothing
,
however
,
was
done
at
the
dinner
-
table
.
<EOS>
No
work
got
itself
accomplished
.
<EOS>
The
widow
was
so
accurately
fair
in
the
adjustment
of
her
favours
,
that
even
Jeannette
could
not
perceive
to
which
of
the
two
she
turned
with
the
amplest
smile
.
<EOS>
She
talked
herself
and
made
others
talk
,
till
Cheesacre
became
almost
comfortable
,
in
spite
of
his
jealousy
.
"
<EOS>
And
now
,
"
she
said
,
as
she
got
up
to
leave
the
room
,
when
she
had
taken
her
own
glass
of
wine
,
"
We
will
allow
these
two
gentlemen
just
half
an
hour
,
eh
Charlie
?
<EOS>
and
then
we
shall
expect
them
up
-
stairs
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ten
minutes
will
be
enough
for
us
here
,
"
said
Cheesacre
,
who
was
in
a
hurry
to
utilize
his
time
.
  
<EOS>
"
Half
an
hour
,
"
said
Mrs.
Greenow
,
not
without
some
little
tone
of
command
in
her
voice
.
<EOS>
Ten
minutes
might
be
enough
for
Mr.
Cheesacre
,
but
ten
minutes
was
not
enough
for
her
.
  
<EOS>
Bellfield
had
opened
the
door
,
and
it
was
upon
him
that
the
widow
's
eye
glanced
as
she
left
the
room
.
<EOS>
Cheesacre
saw
it
,
and
resolved
to
resent
the
injury
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
tell
you
what
it
is
,
Bellfield
,
"
he
said
,
as
he
sat
down
moodily
over
the
fire
,
"
I
wo
n't
have
you
coming
here
at
all
,
till
this
matter
is
settled
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Till
what
matter
is
settled
?
"
said
Bellfield
,
filling
his
glass
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
what
matter
I
mean
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
take
such
a
deuce
of
a
time
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
do
n't
.
<EOS>
I
take
as
little
time
as
anybody
could
.
<EOS>
That
other
fellow
has
only
been
dead
about
nine
months
,
and
I
've
got
the
thing
in
excellent
training
already
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
harm
do
I
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
disturb
me
,
and
you
disturb
her
.
<EOS>
You
do
it
on
purpose
.
<EOS>
Do
you
suppose
I
ca
n't
see
?
<EOS>
I
'll
tell
you
<EOS>
what
,
now
;
if
you
'll
go
clean
out
of
Norwich
for
a
month
,
I
'll
lend
you
two
hundred
pounds
on
the
day
she
becomes
Mrs.
Cheesacre
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
where
am
I
to
go
to
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
may
stay
at
Oileymead
,
if
you
like
;
 
that
is
,
on
condition
that
you
do
stay
there
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
be
told
that
I
hack
the
ham
because
it
's
not
my
own
.
<EOS>
Shall
I
tell
you
a
piece
of
my
mind
,
Cheesacre
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
That
woman
has
no
more
idea
of
marrying
you
than
she
has
of
marrying
the
Bishop
.
<EOS>
Wo
n't
you
fill
your
glass
,
old
fellow
?
<EOS>
I
know
where
the
tap
is
if
you
want
another
bottle
.
<EOS>
You
may
as
well
give
it
up
,
and
spend
no
more
money
in
pink
fronts
and
polished
boots
on
her
account
.
<EOS>
You
're
a
podgy
man
,
you
see
,
and
Mrs.
Greenow
does
n't
like
podgy
men
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Cheesacre
sat
looking
at
him
with
his
mouth
open
,
dumb
with
surprise
,
and
almost
paralysed
with
impotent
anger
.
<EOS>
What
had
happened
during
the
last
few
hours
to
change
so
entirely
the
tone
of
his
dependent
captain
?
<EOS>
Could
it
be
that
Bellfield
had
been
there
during
the
morning
,
and
that
she
had
accepted
him
?
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
very
podgy
,
Cheesacre
,
"
Bellfield
continued
,
"
and
then
you
so
often
smell
of
the
farm
-
yard
;
and
you
talk
too
much
of
your
money
and
your
property
.
<EOS>
You
'd
have
had
a
better
chance
if
you
had
openly
talked
to
her
of
hers
,
 
as
I
have
done
.
<EOS>
As
it
is
,
you
have
n't
any
chance
at
all
.
"
  
<EOS>
Bellfield
,
as
he
thus
spoke
to
the
man
opposite
to
him
,
went
on
drinking
his
wine
comfortably
,
and
seemed
to
be
chuckling
with
glee
.
<EOS>
Cheesacre
was
so
astounded
,
so
lost
in
amazement
that
the
creature
whom
he
had
fed
,
 
whom
he
had
bribed
with
money
out
of
his
own
pocket
,
should
thus
turn
against
him
,
that
for
a
while
he
could
not
collect
his
thoughts
or
find
voice
wherewith
to
make
any
answer
.
<EOS>
It
occurred
to
him
immediately
that
Bellfield
was
even
now
,
at
this
very
time
,
staying
at
his
house
,
 
that
he
,
Cheesacre
,
was
expected
to
drive
him
,
Bellfield
,
back
to
Oileymead
,
to
his
own
Oileymead
,
on
this
very
evening
;
and
as
he
thought
of
this
he
almost
fancied
that
he
must
be
in
a
dream
.
<EOS>
He
shook
himself
,
and
looked
again
,
and
there
sat
Bellfield
,
eyeing
him
through
the
bright
colour
of
a
glass
of
port
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
I
've
told
you
a
bit
of
my
mind
,
Cheesy
,
my
boy
,
"
continued
Bellfield
,
"
and
you
'll
save
yourself
a
deal
of
trouble
and
annoyance
if
you
'll
believe
what
I
say
.
<EOS>
She
does
n't
mean
to
marry
you
.
<EOS>
It
's
most
probable
that
she
'll
marry
me
;
but
,
at
any
rate
,
she
wo
n't
marry
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
mean
to
pay
me
my
money
,
sir
?
"
said
Cheesacre
,
at
last
,
finding
his
readiest
means
of
attack
in
that
quarter
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
when
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
When
I
've
married
Mrs.
Greenow
,
 
and
,
therefore
,
I
expect
your
assistance
in
that
little
scheme
.
<EOS>
Let
us
drink
her
health
.
<EOS>
We
shall
always
be
delighted
to
see
you
at
our
house
,
Cheesy
,
my
boy
,
and
you
shall
be
allowed
to
hack
the
hams
just
as
much
as
you
please
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
shall
be
made
to
pay
for
this
,
"
said
Cheesacre
,
gasping
with
anger
;
 
gasping
almost
more
with
dismay
than
he
did
with
anger
.
  
<EOS>
"
All
right
,
old
fellow
;
I
'll
pay
for
it
,
 
with
the
widow
's
money
.
<EOS>
Come
;
our
half
-
hour
is
nearly
over
;
shall
we
go
up
-
stairs
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
expose
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
n't
now
;
 
do
n't
be
ill
-
natured
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
tell
me
where
you
mean
to
sleep
to
-
night
,
Captain
Bellfield
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
sleep
at
Oileymead
it
will
only
be
on
condition
that
I
have
one
of
the
mahogany
-
furnitured
bedrooms
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
'll
never
put
your
foot
in
that
house
again
.
<EOS>
You
're
a
rascal
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Come
,
come
,
Cheesy
,
it
wo
n't
do
for
us
to
quarrel
in
a
lady
's
house
.
<EOS>
It
would
n't
be
the
thing
at
all
.
<EOS>
You
're
not
drinking
your
wine
.
<EOS>
You
might
as
well
take
another
glass
,
and
then
we
'll
go
up
-
stairs
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
've
left
your
traps
at
Oileymead
,
and
not
one
of
them
you
shall
have
<EOS>
till
you
've
paid
me
every
shilling
<EOS>
you
owe
me
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
believe
you
've
a
shirt
in
the
world
beyond
what
you
've
got
there
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
lucky
<EOS>
I
brought
one
in
to
change
;
was
n't
it
,
Cheesy
?
<EOS>
I
should
n't
have
thought
of
it
only
for
the
hint
you
gave
me
.
<EOS>
I
might
as
well
ring
the
bell
for
Jeannette
to
put
away
the
wine
,
if
you
wo
n't
take
any
more
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Then
he
rang
the
bell
,
and
when
Jeannette
came
he
skipped
lightly
up
-
stairs
into
the
drawing
-
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
Was
he
here
before
to
-
day
?
"
said
Cheesacre
,
nodding
his
head
at
the
doorway
through
which
Bellfield
had
passed
.
  
<EOS>
"
Who
?
<EOS>
The
Captain
?
<EOS>
Oh
dear
<EOS>
no
.
<EOS>
The
Captain
do
n't
come
here
much
now
;
 
not
to
say
often
,
by
no
means
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
's
a
confounded
rascal
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Mr.
Cheesacre
!
"
said
Jeannette
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
;
 
and
I
ai
n't
sure
that
there
ai
n't
others
nearly
as
bad
as
he
is
.
"
  
"
If
you
mean
me
,
Mr.
Cheesacre
,
I
do
declare
you
're
a
wronging
me
;
I
do
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
meaning
of
his
going
on
in
this
way
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
nothing
of
his
ways
,
Mr.
Cheesacre
;
but
I
've
been
as
true
to
you
,
sir
;
 
so
<EOS>
I
have
;
 
as
true
as
true
.
"
<EOS>
And
Jeannette
put
her
handkerchief
up
to
her
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
He
moved
to
the
door
,
and
then
a
thought
occurred
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
put
his
hand
to
his
trousers
pocket
,
and
turning
back
towards
the
girl
,
gave
her
half
-
a
-
crown
.
<EOS>
She
curtsied
as
she
took
it
,
and
then
repeated
her
last
words
.
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Mr.
Cheesacre
,
 
as
true
as
true
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Cheesacre
said
nothing
further
,
but
followed
his
enemy
up
to
the
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
"
What
game
is
up
now
,
I
wonder
,
"
said
Jeannette
to
herself
,
when
she
was
left
alone
.
<EOS>
"
They
two'll
be
cutting
each
other
's
throatses
before
they
've
done
,
and
then
my
missus
will
take
the
surwiver
.
<EOS>
"
But
she
made
up
her
mind
that
Cheesacre
should
be
the
one
to
have
his
throat
cut
fatally
,
and
that
Bellfield
should
be
the
survivor
.
  
<EOS>
Cheesacre
,
when
he
reached
the
drawing
-
room
,
found
Bellfield
sitting
on
the
same
sofa
with
Mrs.
Greenow
looking
at
a
book
of
photographs
which
they
both
of
them
were
handling
together
.
<EOS>
The
outside
rim
of
her
widow
's
frill
on
one
occasion
touched
the
Captain
's
whisker
,
and
as
it
did
so
the
Captain
looked
up
with
a
gratified
expression
of
triumph
.
<EOS>
If
any
gentleman
has
ever
seen
the
same
thing
under
similar
circumstances
,
he
will
understand
that
Cheesacre
must
have
been
annoyed
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Mrs.
Greenow
,
waving
her
handkerchief
,
of
which
little
but
a
two
-
inch
-
deep
border
seemed
to
be
visible
.
<EOS>
Bellfield
knew
at
once
that
it
was
not
the
same
handkerchief
which
she
had
waved
before
they
went
down
to
dinner
.
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
 
there
he
is
.
<EOS>
It
's
so
like
him
.
"
<EOS>
And
then
she
apostrophized
the
_
carte
de
visite
_
of
the
departed
one
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Dear
Greenow
;
dear
husband
!
<EOS>
When
my
spirit
is
false
to
thee
,
let
thine
forget
to
visit
me
softly
in
my
dreams
.
<EOS>
Thou
wast
unmatched
among
husbands
.
<EOS>
Whose
tender
kindness
was
ever
equal
to
thine
?
<EOS>
whose
sweet
temper
was
ever
so
constant
?
<EOS>
whose
manly
care
so
all
-
sufficient
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
While
the
words
fell
from
her
lips
her
little
finger
was
touching
Bellfield
's
little
finger
,
as
they
held
the
book
between
them
.
<EOS>
Charlie
Fairstairs
and
Mr.
Cheesacre
were
watching
her
narrowly
,
and
she
knew
that
they
were
watching
her
.
<EOS>
She
was
certainly
a
woman
of
great
genius
and
of
great
courage
.
  
<EOS>
Bellfield
,
moved
by
the
eloquence
of
her
words
,
looked
with
some
interest
at
the
photograph
.
<EOS>
There
was
represented
there
before
him
,
a
small
,
grey
-
looking
,
insignificant
old
man
,
with
pig
's
eyes
and
a
toothless
mouth
,
 
one
who
should
never
have
been
compelled
to
submit
himself
to
the
cruelty
of
the
sun
's
portraiture
!
<EOS>
Another
widow
,
even
if
she
had
kept
in
her
book
the
photograph
of
such
a
husband
,
would
have
scrambled
it
over
silently
,
 
would
have
been
ashamed
to
show
it
.
"
<EOS>
Have
you
ever
seen
it
,
Mr.
Cheesacre
?
"
asked
Mrs.
Greenow
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
so
like
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
saw
it
at
Yarmouth
,
"
said
Cheesacre
,
very
sulkily
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
you
did
not
,
"
said
the
lady
with
some
dignity
,
and
not
a
little
of
rebuke
in
her
tone
;
"
simply
because
it
never
was
at
Yarmouth
.
<EOS>
A
larger
one
you
may
have
seen
,
which
I
always
keep
,
and
always
shall
keep
,
close
by
my
bedside
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
if
I
know
it
,
"
said
Captain
Bellfield
to
himself
.
<EOS>
Then
the
widow
punished
Mr.
Cheesacre
for
his
sullenness
by
whispering
a
few
words
to
the
Captain
;
and
Cheesacre
in
his
wrath
turned
to
Charlie
Fairstairs
.
<EOS>
Then
it
was
that
he
spake
out
his
mind
about
the
Captain
's
rank
,
and
was
snubbed
by
Charlie
,
 
as
was
told
a
page
or
two
back
.
  
<EOS>
After
that
,
coffee
was
brought
to
them
,
and
here
again
Cheesacre
in
his
ill
-
humour
allowed
the
Captain
to
out
-
manoeuvre
him
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
Captain
who
put
the
sugar
into
the
cups
and
handed
them
round
.
<EOS>
He
even
handed
a
cup
to
his
enemy
.
<EOS>
"
None
for
me
,
Captain
Bellfield
;
many
thanks
for
your
politeness
all
the
same
,
"
said
Mr.
Cheesacre
;
and
Mrs.
Greenow
knew
from
the
tone
of
his
voice
that
there
had
been
a
quarrel
.
  
<EOS>
Cheesacre
sitting
then
in
his
gloom
,
had
resolved
upon
one
thing
,
 
or
,
I
may
perhaps
say
,
upon
two
things
.
<EOS>
He
had
resolved
that
he
would
not
leave
the
room
that
evening
till
Bellfield
had
left
it
;
and
that
he
would
get
a
final
answer
from
the
widow
,
if
not
that
night
,
 
for
he
thought
it
very
possible
that
they
might
both
be
sent
away
together
,
 
then
early
after
breakfast
on
the
following
morning
.
<EOS>
For
the
present
,
he
had
given
up
any
idea
of
turning
his
time
to
good
account
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
perhaps
a
coward
,
but
he
had
not
that
special
courage
which
enables
a
man
to
fight
well
under
adverse
circumstances
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
cowed
by
the
unexpected
impertinence
of
his
rival
,
 
by
the
insolence
of
a
man
to
whom
he
thought
that
he
had
obtained
the
power
of
being
always
himself
as
insolent
as
he
pleased
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
recover
his
ground
quickly
,
or
carry
himself
before
his
lady
's
eye
as
though
he
was
unconscious
of
the
wound
he
had
received
.
<EOS>
So
he
sat
silent
,
while
Bellfield
was
discoursing
fluently
.
<EOS>
He
sat
in
silence
,
comforting
himself
with
reflections
on
his
own
wealth
,
and
on
the
poverty
of
the
other
,
and
promising
himself
a
rich
harvest
of
revenge
when
the
moment
should
come
in
which
he
might
tell
Mrs.
Greenow
how
absolutely
that
man
was
a
beggar
,
a
swindler
,
and
a
rascal
.
  
<EOS>
And
he
was
astonished
when
an
opportunity
for
doing
so
came
very
quickly
.
<EOS>
Before
the
neighbouring
clock
had
done
striking
seven
,
Bellfield
rose
from
his
chair
to
go
.
<EOS>
He
first
of
all
spoke
a
word
of
farewell
to
Miss
Fairstairs
;
then
he
turned
to
his
late
host
;
"
Good
night
,
Cheesacre
,
"
he
said
,
in
the
easiest
tone
in
the
world
;
after
that
he
pressed
the
widow
's
hand
and
whispered
his
adieu
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
thought
you
were
staying
at
Oileymead
?
"
said
Mrs.
Greenow
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
came
from
there
this
morning
,
"
said
the
Captain
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
he
is
n't
going
back
there
,
I
can
tell
you
,
"
said
Mr.
Cheesacre
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
indeed
,
"
said
Mrs.
Greenow
;
"
I
hope
there
is
nothing
wrong
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
All
as
right
as
a
trivet
,
"
said
the
Captain
;
and
then
he
was
off
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
promised
mamma
that
I
would
be
home
by
seven
,
"
said
Charlie
Fairstairs
,
rising
from
her
chair
.
<EOS>
It
can
not
be
supposed
that
she
had
any
wish
to
oblige
Mr.
Cheesacre
,
and
therefore
this
movement
on
her
part
must
be
regarded
simply
as
done
in
kindness
to
Mrs.
Greenow
.
<EOS>
She
might
be
mistaken
in
supposing
that
Mrs.
Greenow
would
desire
to
be
left
alone
with
Mr.
Cheesacre
;
but
it
was
clear
to
her
that
in
this
way
she
could
give
no
offence
,
whereas
it
was
quite
possible
that
she
might
offend
by
remaining
.
<EOS>
A
little
after
seven
Mr.
Cheesacre
found
himself
alone
with
the
lady
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
sorry
to
find
,
"
said
she
,
gravely
,
"
that
you
two
have
quarrelled
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Greenow
,
"
said
he
,
jumping
up
,
and
becoming
on
a
sudden
full
of
life
,
"
that
man
is
a
downright
swindler
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Mr.
Cheesacre
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
.
<EOS>
He
'll
tell
you
that
he
was
at
Inkerman
,
but
I
believe
he
was
in
prison
all
the
time
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
Captain
had
been
arrested
,
I
think
twice
,
and
thus
Mr.
Cheesacre
justified
to
himself
this
assertion
.
<EOS>
"
I
doubt
whether
he
ever
saw
a
shot
fired
,
"
he
continued
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
's
none
the
worse
for
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
he
tells
such
lies
;
and
then
he
has
not
a
penny
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
How
much
do
you
suppose
he
owes
me
,
now
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
However
much
it
is
,
I
'm
sure
you
are
too
much
of
a
gentleman
to
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Well
;
 
yes
,
I
am
,
"
said
he
,
trying
to
recover
himself
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
when
I
asked
him
how
he
intended
to
pay
me
,
what
do
you
think
he
said
?
<EOS>
He
said
he
'd
pay
me
when
he
got
your
money
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
money
!
<EOS>
He
could
n't
have
said
that
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
he
did
,
Mrs.
Greenow
;
I
give
you
my
word
and
honour
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
pay
you
when
I
get
the
widow
's
money
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
You
gentlemen
must
have
a
nice
way
of
talking
about
me
when
I
am
absent
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
said
a
disrespectful
word
about
you
in
my
life
,
Mrs.
Greenow
,
 
or
thought
one
.
<EOS>
He
does
;
 
he
says
horrible
things
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
horrible
things
,
Mr.
Cheesacre
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
ca
n't
tell
you
;
 
but
he
does
.
<EOS>
What
can
you
expect
from
such
a
man
as
that
,
who
,
to
my
knowledge
,
wo
n't
have
a
change
of
clothes
to
-
morrow
,
except
what
he
brought
in
on
his
back
this
morning
.
<EOS>
Where
he
's
to
get
a
bed
to
-
night
,
I
do
n't
know
,
for
I
doubt
whether
he
's
got
half
-
a
-
crown
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Poor
Bellfield
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
he
is
poor
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
how
gracefully
he
carries
his
poverty
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
call
it
very
disgraceful
,
Mrs.
Greenow
.
<EOS>
"
To
this
she
made
no
reply
,
and
then
he
thought
that
he
might
begin
his
work
.
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Greenow
,
 
may
I
say
Arabella
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Cheesacre
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
may
n't
I
?
<EOS>
Come
,
Mrs.
Greenow
.
<EOS>
You
know
well
enough
by
this
time
what
it
is
I
mean
.
<EOS>
What
's
the
use
of
shilly
-
shallying
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Shilly
-
shallying
,
Mr.
Cheesacre
!
<EOS>
I
never
heard
such
language
.
<EOS>
If
I
bid
you
good
night
,
now
,
and
tell
you
that
it
is
time
for
you
to
go
home
,
shall
you
call
that
shilly
-
shallying
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
had
made
a
mistake
in
his
word
and
repented
it
.
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
Mrs.
Greenow
;
I
do
indeed
.
<EOS>
I
did
n't
mean
anything
offensive
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Shilly
-
shallying
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
There
's
very
little
shall
in
it
,
I
can
assure
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
poor
man
was
dreadfully
crestfallen
,
so
much
so
that
the
widow
's
heart
relented
,
and
she
pardoned
him
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
in
her
nature
to
quarrel
with
people
;
 
at
any
rate
,
not
with
her
lovers
.
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
Mrs.
Greenow
,
"
said
the
culprit
,
humbly
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
granted
,
"
said
the
widow
;
"
but
never
tell
a
lady
again
that
she
is
shilly
-
shallying
.
<EOS>
And
look
here
,
Mr.
Cheesacre
,
if
it
should
ever
come
to
pass
that
you
are
making
love
to
a
lady
in
earnest
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
could
n't
be
more
in
earnest
,
"
said
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
you
are
making
love
to
a
lady
in
earnest
,
talk
to
her
a
little
more
about
your
passion
and
a
little
less
about
your
purse
.
<EOS>
Now
,
good
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
we
are
friends
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
yes
;
 
as
good
friends
as
ever
.
"
  
<EOS>
Cheesacre
,
as
he
drove
himself
home
in
the
dark
,
tried
to
console
himself
by
thinking
of
the
miserable
plight
in
which
Bellfield
would
find
himself
at
Norwich
,
with
no
possessions
but
what
he
had
brought
into
the
town
that
day
in
a
small
bag
.
<EOS>
But
as
he
turned
in
at
his
own
gate
he
met
two
figures
emerging
;
one
of
them
was
laden
with
a
portmanteau
,
and
the
other
with
a
hat
case
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
only
me
,
Cheesy
,
my
boy
,
"
said
Bellfield
.
<EOS>
"
I
've
just
come
down
by
the
rail
to
fetch
my
things
,
and
I
'm
going
back
to
Norwich
by
the
9.20
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
've
stolen
anything
of
mine
I
'll
have
you
prosecuted
,
"
roared
Cheesacre
,
as
he
drove
his
gig
up
to
his
own
door
.
     
<EOS>
A
Noble
Lord
Dies
.
 
<EOS>
George
Vavasor
remained
about
four
days
beneath
his
grandfather
's
roof
;
but
he
was
not
happy
there
himself
,
nor
did
he
contribute
to
the
happiness
of
any
one
else
.
<EOS>
He
remained
there
in
great
discomfort
so
long
,
being
unwilling
to
leave
till
an
answer
had
been
received
to
the
request
made
to
Aunt
Greenow
,
in
order
that
he
might
insist
on
Kate
's
performance
of
her
promise
with
reference
to
Alice
,
if
that
answer
should
be
unfavourable
.
<EOS>
During
these
five
days
Kate
did
all
in
her
power
to
induce
her
brother
to
be
,
at
any
rate
,
kind
in
his
manner
towards
his
grandfather
,
but
it
was
in
vain
.
<EOS>
The
Squire
would
not
be
the
first
to
be
gracious
;
and
George
,
quite
as
obstinate
as
the
old
man
,
would
take
no
steps
in
that
direction
till
encouraged
to
do
so
by
graciousness
from
the
other
side
.
<EOS>
Poor
Kate
entreated
each
of
them
to
begin
,
but
her
entreaties
were
of
no
avail
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
is
an
ill
-
mannered
cub
,
"
the
old
man
said
,
"
and
I
was
a
fool
to
let
him
into
the
house
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
mention
his
name
to
me
again
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
George
argued
the
matter
more
at
length
.
<EOS>
Kate
spoke
to
him
of
his
own
interest
in
the
matter
,
urging
upon
him
that
he
might
,
by
such
conduct
,
drive
the
Squire
to
exclude
him
altogether
from
the
property
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
must
do
as
he
likes
,
"
George
said
,
sulkily
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
for
Alice
's
sake
!
"
<EOS>
Kate
answered
.
  
<EOS>
"
Alice
would
be
the
last
to
expect
me
to
submit
to
unreasonable
ill
-
usage
for
the
sake
of
money
.
<EOS>
As
regards
myself
,
I
confess
that
I
'm
very
fond
of
money
and
am
not
particularly
squeamish
.
<EOS>
I
would
do
anything
that
a
man
can
do
to
secure
it
.
<EOS>
But
this
I
ca
n't
do
.
<EOS>
I
never
injured
him
,
and
I
never
asked
him
to
injure
himself
.
<EOS>
I
never
attempted
to
borrow
money
from
him
.
<EOS>
I
have
never
cost
him
a
shilling
.
<EOS>
When
I
was
in
the
wine
business
he
might
have
enabled
me
to
make
a
large
fortune
simply
by
settling
on
me
then
the
reversion
of
property
which
,
when
he
dies
,
ought
to
be
my
own
.
<EOS>
He
was
so
perversely
ignorant
that
he
would
make
no
inquiry
,
but
chose
to
think
that
I
was
ruining
myself
,
at
the
only
time
of
my
life
when
I
was
really
doing
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
he
had
a
right
to
act
as
he
pleased
,
"
urged
Kate
.
  
<EOS>
"
Certainly
he
had
.
<EOS>
But
he
had
no
right
to
resent
my
asking
such
a
favour
at
his
hands
.
<EOS>
He
was
an
ignorant
old
fool
not
to
do
it
;
but
I
should
never
have
quarrelled
with
him
on
that
account
.
<EOS>
Nature
made
him
a
fool
,
and
it
was
n't
his
fault
.
<EOS>
But
I
ca
n't
bring
myself
to
kneel
in
the
dirt
before
him
simply
because
I
asked
for
what
was
reasonable
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
two
men
said
very
little
to
each
other
.
<EOS>
They
were
never
alone
together
except
during
that
half
-
hour
after
dinner
in
which
they
were
supposed
to
drink
their
wine
.
<EOS>
The
old
Squire
always
took
three
glasses
of
port
during
this
period
,
and
expected
that
his
grandson
would
take
three
with
him
.
<EOS>
But
George
would
drink
none
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
given
up
drinking
wine
after
dinner
,
"
said
he
,
when
his
grandfather
pushed
the
bottle
over
to
him
.
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
you
mean
that
you
drink
nothing
but
claret
,
"
said
the
Squire
,
in
a
tone
of
voice
that
was
certainly
not
conciliatory
.
<EOS>
"
I
mean
simply
what
I
say
,
"
said
George
 
"
that
I
have
given
up
drinking
wine
after
dinner
.
<EOS>
"
The
old
man
could
not
openly
quarrel
with
his
heir
on
such
a
point
as
that
.
<EOS>
Even
Mr.
Vavasor
could
not
tell
his
grandson
that
he
was
going
to
the
dogs
because
he
had
become
temperate
.
<EOS>
But
,
nevertheless
,
there
was
offence
in
it
;
and
when
George
sat
perfectly
silent
,
looking
at
the
fire
,
evidently
determined
to
make
no
attempt
at
conversation
,
the
offence
grew
,
and
became
strong
.
<EOS>
"
What
the
devil
's
the
use
of
your
sitting
there
if
you
neither
drink
nor
talk
?
"
said
the
old
man
.
"
<EOS>
No
use
in
the
world
,
that
I
can
see
,
"
said
George
;
"
if
,
however
,
I
were
to
leave
you
,
you
would
abuse
me
for
it
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
care
how
soon
you
leave
me
,
"
said
the
Squire
.
<EOS>
From
all
which
it
may
be
seen
that
George
Vavasor
's
visit
to
the
hall
of
his
ancestors
was
not
satisfactory
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
fourth
day
,
about
noon
,
came
Aunt
Greenow
's
reply
.
"
<EOS>
Dearest
Kate
,
"
she
said
,
"
I
am
not
going
to
do
what
you
ask
me
,
"
 
thus
rushing
instantly
into
the
middle
of
her
subject
.
  
<EOS>
You
see
,
I
do
n't
know
my
nephew
,
and
have
no
reason
for
being
specially
anxious
that
he
should
be
in
Parliament
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
care
two
straws
about
the
glory
of
the
Vavasor
family
.
<EOS>
If
I
had
never
done
anything
for
myself
,
the
Vavasors
would
have
done
very
little
for
me
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
care
much
about
what
you
call
"
blood
.
<EOS>
"
I
like
those
who
like
me
,
and
whom
I
know
.
<EOS>
I
am
very
fond
of
you
,
and
because
you
have
been
good
to
me
<EOS>
I
would
give
you
a
thousand
pounds
if
you
wanted
it
for
yourself
;
but
I
do
n't
see
why
I
am
to
give
my
money
to
those
I
do
n't
know
.
<EOS>
If
it
is
necessary
to
tell
my
nephew
of
this
,
pray
tell
him
that
I
mean
no
offence
.
  
<EOS>
Your
friend
C.
is
still
waiting
 
waiting
 
waiting
,
patiently
;
but
his
patience
may
be
exhausted
.
  
<EOS>
Your
affectionate
aunt
,
  
ARABELLA
GREENOW
.
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
she
wo
n't
,
"
said
George
,
as
he
threw
back
the
letter
to
his
sister
.
<EOS>
"
Why
should
she
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
had
hoped
she
would
,
"
said
Kate
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
should
she
?
<EOS>
What
did
I
ever
do
for
her
?
<EOS>
She
is
a
sensible
woman
.
<EOS>
Who
is
your
friend
C.
,
and
why
is
he
waiting
patiently
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
a
man
who
would
be
glad
to
marry
her
for
her
money
,
if
she
would
take
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
what
does
she
mean
by
his
patience
being
exhausted
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
her
folly
.
<EOS>
She
chooses
to
pretend
to
think
that
the
man
is
a
lover
of
mine
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Has
he
got
any
money
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
lots
of
money
 
or
money
's
worth
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
is
his
name
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
His
name
is
Cheesacre
.
<EOS>
But
pray
do
n't
trouble
yourself
to
talk
about
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
he
wants
to
marry
you
,
and
has
plenty
of
money
,
why
should
n't
you
take
him
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Good
heavens
,
George
!
<EOS>
In
the
first
place
he
does
not
want
to
marry
me
.
<EOS>
In
the
next
place
all
his
heart
is
in
his
farmyard
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
a
very
good
place
to
have
it
,
"
said
George
.
  
<EOS>
"
Undoubtedly
.
<EOS>
But
,
really
,
you
must
not
trouble
yourself
to
talk
about
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Only
this
,
 
that
I
should
be
very
glad
to
see
you
well
married
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Should
you
?
"
said
she
,
thinking
of
her
close
attachment
to
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
now
,
about
the
money
,
"
said
George
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
write
to
Alice
at
once
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
George
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
you
must
;
you
have
promised
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
it
would
have
been
much
wiser
if
you
had
taken
me
at
my
word
,
and
done
it
at
once
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
do
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Then
the
scar
on
his
face
opened
itself
,
and
his
sister
stood
before
him
in
fear
and
trembling
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Do
you
mean
to
tell
me
,
"
said
he
,
"
that
you
will
go
back
from
your
word
,
and
deceive
me
;
 
that
after
having
kept
me
here
by
this
promise
,
you
will
not
do
what
you
have
said
you
would
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Take
my
money
now
,
and
pay
me
out
of
hers
as
soon
as
you
are
married
.
<EOS>
I
will
be
the
first
to
claim
it
from
her
,
 
and
from
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
nonsense
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
should
it
be
nonsense
?
<EOS>
Surely
you
need
have
no
scruple
with
me
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
none
with
you
if
I
wanted
assistance
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Look
here
,
Kate
;
I
wo
n't
have
it
,
and
there
's
an
end
of
it
.
<EOS>
All
that
you
have
in
the
world
would
not
pull
me
through
this
election
,
and
therefore
such
a
loan
would
be
worse
than
useless
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
am
I
to
ask
her
for
more
than
two
thousand
pounds
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
to
ask
her
simply
for
one
thousand
.
<EOS>
That
is
what
I
want
,
and
must
have
,
at
present
.
<EOS>
And
she
knows
that
I
want
it
,
and
that
she
is
to
supply
it
;
only
she
does
not
know
that
my
need
is
so
immediate
.
<EOS>
That
you
must
explain
to
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
sooner
burn
my
hand
,
George
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
burning
your
hand
,
unfortunately
,
wo
n't
do
any
good
.
<EOS>
Look
here
,
Kate
;
I
insist
upon
your
doing
this
for
me
.
<EOS>
If
you
do
not
,
I
shall
do
it
,
of
course
,
myself
;
but
I
shall
regard
your
refusal
as
an
unjustifiable
falsehood
on
your
part
,
and
shall
certainly
not
see
you
afterwards
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
wish
,
for
reasons
which
you
may
well
understand
,
to
write
to
Alice
myself
on
any
subject
at
present
.
<EOS>
I
now
claim
your
promise
to
do
so
;
and
if
you
refuse
,
I
shall
know
very
well
what
to
do
.
"
  
<EOS>
Of
course
she
did
not
persist
in
her
refusal
.
<EOS>
With
a
sorrowful
heart
,
and
with
fingers
that
could
hardly
form
the
needful
letters
,
she
did
write
a
letter
to
her
cousin
,
which
explained
the
fact
 
that
George
Vavasor
immediately
wanted
a
thousand
pounds
for
his
electioneering
purposes
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
stiff
,
uncomfortable
letter
,
unnatural
in
its
phraseology
,
telling
its
own
tale
of
grief
and
shame
.
<EOS>
Alice
understood
very
plainly
all
the
circumstances
under
which
it
was
written
,
but
she
sent
back
word
to
Kate
at
once
,
undertaking
that
the
money
should
be
forthcoming
;
and
she
wrote
again
before
the
end
of
January
,
saying
that
the
sum
named
had
been
paid
to
George
's
credit
at
his
own
bankers
.
  
<EOS>
Kate
had
taken
immense
pride
in
the
renewal
of
the
match
between
her
brother
and
her
cousin
,
and
had
rejoiced
in
it
greatly
as
being
her
own
work
.
<EOS>
But
all
that
pride
and
joy
were
now
over
.
<EOS>
She
could
no
longer
write
triumphant
notes
to
Alice
,
speaking
always
of
George
as
one
who
was
to
be
their
joint
hero
,
foretelling
great
things
of
his
career
in
Parliament
,
and
saying
little
soft
things
of
his
enduring
love
.
<EOS>
It
was
no
longer
possible
to
her
now
to
write
of
George
at
all
,
and
it
was
equally
impossible
to
Alice
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
no
letters
passed
between
them
,
when
that
monetary
correspondence
was
over
,
up
to
the
end
of
the
winter
.
<EOS>
Kate
remained
down
in
Westmoreland
,
wretched
and
ill
at
ease
,
listening
to
hard
words
spoken
by
her
grandfather
against
her
brother
,
and
feeling
herself
unable
to
take
her
brother
's
part
as
she
had
been
wo
nt
to
do
in
other
times
.
  
<EOS>
George
returned
to
town
at
the
end
of
those
four
days
,
and
found
that
the
thousand
pounds
was
duly
placed
to
his
credit
before
the
end
of
the
month
.
<EOS>
It
is
hardly
necessary
to
tell
the
reader
that
this
money
had
come
from
the
stores
of
Mr.
Tombe
,
and
that
Mr.
Tombe
duly
debited
Mr.
Grey
with
the
amount
.
<EOS>
Alice
,
in
accordance
with
her
promise
,
had
told
her
father
that
the
money
was
needed
,
and
her
father
,
in
accordance
with
his
promise
,
had
procured
it
without
a
word
of
remonstrance
.
<EOS>
"
Surely
I
must
sign
some
paper
,
"
Alice
had
said
.
<EOS>
But
she
had
been
contented
when
her
father
told
her
that
the
lawyers
would
manage
all
that
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
nearly
the
end
of
February
when
George
Vavasor
made
his
first
payment
to
Mr.
Scruby
on
behalf
of
the
coming
election
;
and
when
he
called
at
Mr.
Scruby
's
office
with
this
object
,
he
received
some
intelligence
which
surprised
him
not
a
little
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
n't
heard
the
news
,
"
said
Scruby
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
news
?
<EOS>
"
said
George
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
Marquis
is
as
nearly
off
the
hooks
as
a
man
can
be
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Scruby
,
as
he
communicated
the
tidings
,
showed
clearly
by
his
face
and
voice
that
they
were
supposed
to
be
of
very
great
importance
;
but
Vavasor
did
not
at
first
seem
to
be
as
much
interested
in
the
fate
of
"
the
Marquis
"
as
Scruby
had
intended
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
very
sorry
for
him
,
"
said
George
.
<EOS>
"
Who
is
the
Marquis
?
<EOS>
There
'll
be
sure
to
come
another
,
so
it
do
n't
much
signify
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
will
come
another
,
and
that
's
just
it
.
<EOS>
It
's
the
Marquis
of
Bunratty
;
and
if
he
drops
,
our
young
Member
will
go
into
the
Upper
House
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
,
immediately
;
before
the
end
of
the
Session
?
"
<EOS>
George
,
of
course
,
knew
well
enough
that
such
would
be
the
case
,
but
the
effect
which
this
event
would
have
upon
himself
now
struck
him
suddenly
.
  
<EOS>
"
To
be
sure
,
"
said
Scruby
.
<EOS>
"
The
writ
would
be
out
immediately
.
<EOS>
I
should
be
glad
enough
of
it
,
only
that
I
know
that
Travers
's
people
have
heard
of
it
before
us
,
and
that
they
are
ready
to
be
up
with
their
posters
<EOS>
directly
the
breath
is
out
of
the
Marquis
's
body
.
<EOS>
We
must
go
to
work
immediately
;
that
's
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
will
only
be
for
part
of
a
Session
,
"
said
George
.
  
<EOS>
"
Just
so
,
"
said
Mr.
Scruby
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
then
there
'll
be
the
cost
of
another
election
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
true
,
"
said
Mr.

"
but
in
such
cases
we
do
manage
to
make
it
come
a
little
cheaper

<EOS>
If
you
lick
Travers
now
,
it
may
be
that
you
'll
have
a
walk
-
over
for
the
next
.

<EOS>
"
Have
you
seen
Grimes
?
"
asked
George
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
have
;
the
blackguard
!
<EOS>
He
is
going
to
open
his
house
on
Travers
's
side
.
<EOS>
He
came
to
me
as
bold
as
brass
,
and
told
me
so
,
saying
that
he
never
liked
gentlemen
who
kept
him
waiting
for
his
odd
money
.
<EOS>
What
angers
me
is
that
he
ever
got
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
have
not
managed
it
very
well
,
certainly
,
"
said
Vavasor
,
looking
nastily
at
the
attorney
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
ca
n't
help
those
little
accidents
,
Mr.
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
There
are
worse
accidents
than
that
turn
up
almost
daily
in
my
business
.
<EOS>
You
may
think
yourself
almost
lucky
that
I
have
n't
gone
over
to
Travers
myself
.
<EOS>
He
is
a
Liberal
,
you
know
;
and
it
has
n't
been
for
want
of
an
offer
,
I
can
tell
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Vavasor
was
inclined
to
doubt
the
extent
of
his
luck
in
this
respect
,
and
was
almost
disposed
to
repent
of
his
Parliamentary
ambition
.
<EOS>
He
would
now
be
called
upon
to
spend
certainly
not
less
than
three
thousand
pounds
of
his
cousin
's
money
on
the
chance
of
being
able
to
sit
in
Parliament
for
a
few
months
.
<EOS>
And
then
,
after
what
a
fashion
would
he
be
compelled
to
negotiate
that
loan
!
<EOS>
He
might
,
to
be
sure
,
allow
the
remainder
of
this
Session
to
run
,
and
stand
,
as
he
had
intended
,
at
the
general
election
;
but
he
knew
that
if
he
now
allowed
a
Liberal
to
win
the
seat
,
the
holder
of
the
seat
would
be
almost
sure
of
subsequent
success
.
<EOS>
He
must
either
fight
now
,
or
give
up
the
fight
altogether
;
and
he
was
a
man
who
did
not
love
to
abandon
any
contest
in
which
he
had
been
engaged
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Squire
,
"
said
Scruby
,
"
how
is
it
to
be
?
"
<EOS>
And
Vavasor
felt
that
he
detected
in
the
man
's
voice
some
diminution
of
that
respect
with
which
he
had
hitherto
been
treated
as
a
paying
candidate
for
a
metropolitan
borough
.
  
<EOS>
"
This
lord
is
not
dead
yet
,
"
said
Vavasor
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
he
's
not
dead
yet
,
that
we
have
heard
;
but
it
wo
n't
do
for
us
to
wait
.
<EOS>
We
want
every
minute
of
time
that
we
can
get
.
<EOS>
There
is
n't
any
hope
for
him
,
I
'm
told
.
<EOS>
It
's
gout
in
the
stomach
,
or
dropsy
at
the
heart
,
or
some
of
those
things
that
make
a
fellow
safe
to
go
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
wo
n't
do
to
wait
for
the
next
election
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
ask
me
,
I
should
say
certainly
not
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
I
should
n't
wish
to
have
to
conduct
it
under
such
circumstances
.
<EOS>
I
hate
a
fight
when
there
's
no
chance
of
success
.
<EOS>
I
grudge
spending
a
man
's
money
in
such
a
case
;
I
do
indeed
,
Mr.
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
Grimes
's
going
over
wo
n't
make
much
difference
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
The
blackguard
!
<EOS>
He
'll
take
a
hundred
and
fifty
votes
,
I
suppose
;
perhaps
more
.
<EOS>
But
that
is
not
much
in
such
a
constituency
as
the
Chelsea
districts
.
<EOS>
You
see
,
Travers
played
<EOS>
mean
at
the
last
election
,
and
that
will
be
against
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
the
Conservatives
will
have
a
candidate
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
no
knowing
;
but
I
do
n't
think
they
will
.
<EOS>
They
'll
try
one
at
the
general
,
no
doubt
;
but
if
the
two
sitting
Members
can
pull
together
,
they
wo
n't
have
much
of
a
chance
.
"
  
<EOS>
Vavasor
found
himself
compelled
to
say
that
he
would
stand
;
and
Scruby
undertook
to
give
the
initiatory
orders
at
once
,
not
waiting
even
till
the
Marquis
should
be
dead
.
<EOS>
"
We
should
have
our
houses
open
as
soon
as
theirs
,
"
said
he
.
<EOS>
"
There
's
a
deal
in
that
.
"
<EOS>
So
George
Vavasor
gave
his
orders
.
<EOS>
"
If
the
worst
comes
to
the
worst
,
"
he
said
to
himself
,
"
I
can
always
cut
my
throat
.
"
  
<EOS>
As
he
walked
from
the
attorney
's
office
to
his
club
he
bethought
himself
that
that
might
not
unprobably
be
the
necessary
termination
of
his
career
.
<EOS>
Everything
was
going
wrong
with
him
.
<EOS>
His
grandfather
,
who
was
eighty
years
of
age
,
would
not
die
,
 
appeared
to
have
no
symptoms
of
dying
;
 
whereas
this
Marquis
,
who
was
not
yet
much
over
fifty
,
was
rushing
headlong
out
of
the
world
,
simply
because
he
was
the
one
man
whose
continued
life
at
the
present
moment
would
be
serviceable
to
George
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
As
he
thought
of
his
grandfather
he
almost
broke
his
umbrella
by
the
vehemence
with
which
he
struck
it
against
the
pavement
.
<EOS>
What
right
could
an
ignorant
old
fool
like
that
have
to
live
for
ever
,
keeping
the
possession
of
a
property
which
he
could
not
use
,
and
ruining
those
who
were
to
come
after
him
?
<EOS>
If
now
,
at
this
moment
,
that
wretched
place
down
in
Westmoreland
could
become
his
,
he
might
yet
ride
triumphantly
over
his
difficulties
,
and
refrain
from
sullying
his
hands
with
more
of
his
cousin
's
money
till
she
should
become
his
wife
.
  
<EOS>
Even
that
thousand
pounds
had
not
passed
through
his
hands
without
giving
him
much
bitter
suffering
.
<EOS>
As
is
always
the
case
in
such
matters
,
the
thing
done
was
worse
than
the
doing
of
it
.
<EOS>
He
had
taught
himself
to
look
at
it
lightly
whilst
it
was
yet
unaccomplished
;
but
he
could
not
think
of
it
lightly
now
.
<EOS>
Kate
had
been
right
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
been
better
for
him
to
take
her
money
.
<EOS>
Any
money
would
have
been
better
than
that
upon
which
he
had
laid
his
sacrilegious
hands
.
<EOS>
If
he
could
have
cut
a
purse
,
after
the
old
fashion
,
the
stain
of
the
deed
would
hardly
have
been
so
deep
.
<EOS>
In
these
days
,
 
for
more
than
a
month
,
indeed
,
after
his
return
from
Westmoreland
,
 
he
did
not
go
near
Queen
Anne
Street
,
trying
to
persuade
himself
that
he
stayed
away
because
of
her
coldness
to
him
.
<EOS>
But
,
in
truth
,
he
was
afraid
of
seeing
her
without
speaking
of
her
money
,
and
afraid
to
see
her
if
he
were
to
speak
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
seen
the
_
Globe
_
?
<EOS>
"
someone
said
to
him
as
he
entered
the
club
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
indeed
;
I
have
seen
nothing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Bunratty
died
in
Ireland
this
morning
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
you
'll
be
up
for
the
Chelsea
districts
?
"
   
<EOS>
Parliament
Meets
.
 
<EOS>
Parliament
opened
that
year
on
the
twelfth
of
February
,
and
Mr.
Palliser
was
one
of
the
first
Members
of
the
Lower
House
to
take
his
seat
.
<EOS>
It
had
been
generally
asserted
through
the
country
,
during
the
last
week
,
that
the
existing
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
had
,
so
to
say
,
ceased
to
exist
as
such
;
that
though
he
still
existed
to
the
outer
world
,
drawing
his
salary
,
and
doing
routine
work
,
 
if
a
man
so
big
can
have
any
routine
work
to
do
,
 
he
existed
no
longer
in
the
inner
world
of
the
cabinet
.
<EOS>
He
had
differed
,
men
said
,
with
his
friend
and
chief
,
the
Prime
Minister
,
as
to
the
expediency
of
repealing
what
were
left
of
the
direct
taxes
of
the
country
,
and
was
prepared
to
launch
himself
into
opposition
with
his
small
bodyguard
of
followers
,
with
all
his
energy
and
with
all
his
venom
.
  
<EOS>
There
is
something
very
pleasant
in
the
close
,
bosom
friendship
,
and
bitter
,
uncompromising
animosity
,
of
these
human
gods
,
 
of
these
human
beings
who
would
be
gods
were
they
not
shorn
so
short
of
their
divinity
in
that
matter
of
immortality
.
<EOS>
If
it
were
so
arranged
that
the
same
persons
were
always
friends
,
and
the
same
persons
were
always
enemies
,
as
used
to
be
the
case
among
the
dear
old
heathen
gods
and
goddesses
;
 
if
Parliament
were
an
Olympus
in
which
Juno
and
Venus
never
kissed
,
the
thing
would
not
be
nearly
so
interesting
.
<EOS>
But
in
this
Olympus
partners
are
changed
,
the
divine
bosom
,
now
rabid
with
hatred
against
some
opposing
deity
,
suddenly
becomes
replete
with
love
towards
its
late
enemy
,
and
exciting
changes
occur
which
give
to
the
whole
thing
all
the
keen
interest
of
a
sensational
novel
.
<EOS>
No
doubt
this
is
greatly
lessened
for
those
who
come
too
near
the
scene
of
action
.
<EOS>
Members
of
Parliament
,
and
the
friends
of
Members
of
Parliament
,
are
apt
to
teach
themselves
that
it
means
nothing
;
that
Lord
This
does
not
hate
Mr.
That
,
or
think
him
a
traitor
to
his
country
,
or
wish
to
crucify
him
;
and
that
Sir
John
of
the
Treasury
is
not
much
in
earnest
when
he
speaks
of
his
noble
friend
at
the
"
Foreign
Office
"
as
a
god
to
whom
no
other
god
was
ever
comparable
in
honesty
,
discretion
,
patriotism
,
and
genius
.
<EOS>
But
the
outside
Briton
who
takes
a
delight
in
politics
,
 
and
this
description
should
include
ninety
-
nine
educated
Englishmen
out
of
every
hundred
,
 
should
not
be
desirous
of
peeping
behind
the
scenes
.
<EOS>
No
beholder
at
any
theatre
should
do
so
.
<EOS>
It
is
good
to
believe
in
these
friendships
and
these
enmities
,
and
very
pleasant
to
watch
their
changes
.
<EOS>
It
is
delightful
when
Oxford
embraces
Manchester
,
finding
that
it
can
not
live
without
support
in
that
quarter
;
and
very
delightful
when
the
uncompromising
assailant
of
all
men
in
power
receives
the
legitimate
reward
of
his
energy
by
being
taken
in
among
the
bosoms
of
the
blessed
.
  
<EOS>
But
although
the
outer
world
was
so
sure
that
the
existing
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
had
ceased
to
exist
,
when
the
House
of
Commons
met
that
gentleman
took
his
seat
on
the
Treasury
Bench
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
,
who
had
by
no
means
given
a
general
support
to
the
Ministry
in
the
last
Session
,
took
his
seat
on
the
same
side
of
the
House
indeed
,
but
low
down
,
and
near
to
the
cross
benches
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bott
sat
close
behind
him
,
and
men
knew
that
Mr.
Bott
was
a
distinguished
member
of
Mr.
Palliser
's
party
,
whatever
that
party
might
be
.
<EOS>
Lord
Cinquebars
moved
the
Address
,
and
I
must
confess
that
he
did
it
very
lamely
.
<EOS>
He
was
once
accused
by
Mr.
Maxwell
,
the
brewer
,
of
making
a
great
noise
in
the
hunting
-
field
.
<EOS>
The
accusation
could
not
be
repeated
as
to
his
performance
on
this
occasion
,
as
no
one
could
hear
a
word
that
he
said
.
<EOS>
The
Address
was
seconded
by
Mr.
Loftus
Fitzhoward
,
a
nephew
of
the
Duke
of
St.
Bungay
,
who
spoke
as
though
he
were
resolved
to
trump
poor
Lord
Cinquebars
in
every
sentence
which
he
pronounced
,
 
as
we
so
often
hear
the
second
clergyman
from
the
Communion
Table
trumping
his
weary
predecessor
,
who
has
just
finished
the
Litany
not
in
the
clearest
or
most
audible
voice
.
<EOS>
Every
word
fell
from
Mr.
Fitzhoward
with
the
elaborate
accuracy
of
a
separate
pistol
-
shot
;
and
as
he
became
pleased
with
himself
in
his
progress
,
and
warm
with
his
work
,
he
accented
his
words
sharply
,
made
rhetorical
pauses
,
even
moved
his
hands
about
in
action
,
and
quite
disgusted
his
own
party
,
who
had
been
very
well
satisfied
with
Lord
Cinquebars
.
<EOS>
There
are
many
rocks
which
a
young
speaker
in
Parliament
should
avoid
,
but
no
rock
which
requires
such
careful
avoiding
as
the
rock
of
eloquence
.
<EOS>
Whatever
may
be
his
faults
,
let
him
at
least
avoid
eloquence
.
<EOS>
He
should
not
be
inaccurate
,
which
,
however
,
is
not
much
;
he
should
not
be
long
-
winded
,
which
is
a
good
deal
;
he
should
not
be
ill
-
tempered
,
which
is
more
;
but
none
of
these
faults
are
so
damnable
as
eloquence
.
<EOS>
All
Mr.
Fitzhoward
's
friends
and
all
his
enemies
knew
that
he
had
had
his
chance
,
and
that
he
had
thrown
it
away
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
Queen
's
Speech
there
had
been
some
very
lukewarm
allusion
to
remission
of
direct
taxation
.
<EOS>
This
remission
,
which
had
already
been
carried
so
far
,
should
be
carried
further
if
such
further
carrying
were
found
practicable
.
<EOS>
So
had
said
the
Queen
.
<EOS>
Those
words
,
it
was
known
,
could
not
have
been
approved
of
by
the
energetic
and
still
existing
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
.
<EOS>
On
this
subject
the
mover
of
the
Address
said
never
a
word
,
and
the
seconder
only
a
word
or
two
.
<EOS>
What
they
had
said
had
,
of
course
,
been
laid
down
for
them
;
though
,
unfortunately
,
the
manner
of
saying
could
not
be
so
easily
prescribed
.
<EOS>
Then
there
arose
a
great
enemy
,
a
man
fluent
of
diction
,
apparently
with
deep
malice
at
his
heart
,
though
at
home
,
 
as
we
used
to
say
at
school
,
 
one
of
the
most
good
-
natured
fellows
in
the
world
;
one
ambitious
of
that
godship
which
a
seat
on
the
other
side
of
the
House
bestowed
,
and
greedy
to
grasp
at
the
chances
which
this
disagreement
in
the
councils
of
the
gods
might
give
him
.
<EOS>
He
was
quite
content
,
he
said
,
to
vote
for
the
Address
,
as
,
he
believed
,
would
be
all
the
gentlemen
on
his
side
of
the
House
.
<EOS>
No
one
could
suspect
them
or
him
of
giving
a
factious
opposition
to
Government
.
<EOS>
Had
they
not
borne
and
forborne
beyond
all
precedent
known
in
that
House
?
<EOS>
Then
he
touched
lightly
,
and
almost
with
grace
to
his
opponents
,
on
many
subjects
,
promising
support
,
and
barely
hinting
that
they
were
totally
and
manifestly
wrong
in
all
things
.
<EOS>
But
 
.
<EOS>
Then
the
tone
of
his
voice
changed
,
and
the
well
-
known
look
of
fury
was
assumed
upon
his
countenance
.
<EOS>
Then
great
Jove
on
the
other
side
pulled
his
hat
over
his
eyes
,
and
smiled
blandly
.
<EOS>
Then
members
put
away
the
papers
they
had
been
reading
for
a
moment
,
and
men
in
the
gallery
began
to
listen
.
<EOS>
But
 
.
<EOS>
The
long
and
the
short
of
it
was
this
;
that
the
existing
Government
had
come
into
power
on
the
cry
of
a
reduction
of
taxation
,
and
now
they
were
going
to
shirk
the
responsibility
of
their
own
measures
.
<EOS>
They
were
going
to
shirk
the
responsibility
of
their
own
election
cry
,
although
it
was
known
that
their
own
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
was
prepared
to
carry
it
out
to
the
full
.
<EOS>
He
was
willing
to
carry
it
out
to
the
full
<EOS>
were
he
not
restrained
by
the
timidity
,
falsehood
,
and
treachery
of
his
colleagues
,
of
whom
,
of
course
,
the
most
timid
,
the
most
false
,
and
the
most
treacherous
was
 
the
great
god
Jove
,
who
sat
blandly
smiling
on
the
other
side
.
  
<EOS>
No
one
should
ever
go
near
the
House
of
Commons
who
wishes
to
enjoy
all
this
.
<EOS>
It
was
so
manifestly
evident
that
neither
Jove
nor
any
of
his
satellites
cared
twopence
for
what
the
irate
gentleman
was
saying
;
nay
,
it
became
so
evident
that
,
in
spite
of
his
assumed
fury
,
the
gentleman
was
not
irate
.
<EOS>
He
intended
to
communicate
his
look
of
anger
to
the
newspaper
reports
of
his
speech
;
and
he
knew
from
experience
that
he
could
succeed
in
that
.
<EOS>
And
men
walked
about
the
House
in
the
most
telling
moments
,
 
enemies
shaking
hands
with
enemies
,
 
in
a
way
that
showed
an
entire
absence
of
all
good
,
honest
hatred
among
them
.
<EOS>
But
the
gentleman
went
on
and
finished
his
speech
,
demanding
at
last
,
in
direct
terms
,
that
the
Treasury
Jove
should
state
plainly
to
the
House
who
was
to
be
,
and
who
was
not
to
be
,
the
bearer
of
the
purse
among
the
gods
.
  
<EOS>
Then
Treasury
Jove
got
up
smiling
,
and
thanked
his
enemy
for
the
cordiality
of
his
support
.
"
<EOS>
He
had
always
,
"
he
said
,
"
done
the
gentleman
's
party
justice
for
their
clemency
,
and
had
feared
no
opposition
from
them
;
and
he
was
glad
to
find
that
he
was
correct
in
his
anticipations
as
to
the
course
they
would
pursue
on
the
present
occasion
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
went
on
saying
a
good
deal
about
home
matters
,
and
foreign
matters
,
proving
that
everything
was
right
,
just
as
easily
as
his
enemy
had
proved
that
everything
was
wrong
.
<EOS>
On
all
these
points
he
was
very
full
,
and
very
courteous
;
but
when
he
came
to
the
subject
of
taxation
,
he
simply
repeated
the
passage
from
the
Queen
's
Speech
,
expressing
a
hope
that
his
right
honourable
friend
,
the
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
,
would
be
able
to
satisfy
the
judgement
of
the
House
,
and
the
wishes
of
the
people
.
<EOS>
That
specially
personal
question
which
had
been
asked
he
did
not
answer
at
all
.
  
<EOS>
But
the
House
was
still
all
agog
,
as
was
the
crowded
gallery
.
<EOS>
The
energetic
and
still
existing
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
was
then
present
,
divided
only
by
one
little
thin
Secretary
of
State
from
Jove
himself
.
<EOS>
Would
he
get
up
and
declare
his
purposes
?
<EOS>
He
was
a
man
who
almost
always
did
get
up
when
an
opportunity
offered
itself
,
 
or
when
it
did
not
.
<EOS>
Some
second
little
gun
was
fired
off
from
the
Opposition
benches
,
and
then
there
was
a
pause
.
<EOS>
Would
the
purse
-
bearer
of
Olympus
rise
upon
his
wings
and
speak
his
mind
,
or
would
he
sit
in
silence
upon
his
cloud
?
<EOS>
There
was
a
general
call
for
the
purse
-
bearer
,
but
he
floated
in
silence
,
and
was
inexplicable
.
<EOS>
The
purse
-
bearer
was
not
to
be
bullied
into
any
sudden
reading
of
the
riddle
.
<EOS>
Then
there
came
on
a
general
debate
about
money
matters
,
in
which
the
purse
-
bearer
did
say
a
few
words
,
but
he
said
nothing
as
to
the
great
question
at
issue
.
<EOS>
At
last
up
got
Mr.
Palliser
,
towards
the
close
of
the
evening
,
and
occupied
a
full
hour
in
explaining
what
taxes
the
Government
might
remit
with
safety
,
and
what
they
might
not
,
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Bott
,
meanwhile
,
prompting
him
with
figures
from
behind
with
an
assiduity
that
was
almost
too
persistent
.
<EOS>
According
to
Mr.
Palliser
,
the
words
used
in
the
Queen
's
Speech
were
not
at
all
too
cautious
.
<EOS>
The
Members
went
out
gradually
,
and
the
House
became
very
thin
during
this
oration
;
but
the
newspapers
declared
,
next
morning
,
that
his
speech
had
been
the
speech
of
the
night
,
and
that
the
perspicuity
of
Mr.
Palliser
pointed
him
out
as
the
coming
man
.
  
<EOS>
He
returned
home
to
his
house
in
Park
Lane
quite
triumphant
after
his
success
,
and
found
Lady
Glencora
,
at
about
twelve
o'clock
,
sitting
alone
.
<EOS>
She
had
arrived
in
town
on
that
day
,
having
come
up
at
her
own
request
,
instead
of
remaining
at
Matching
Priory
till
after
Easter
,
as
he
had
proposed
.
<EOS>
He
had
wished
her
to
stay
,
in
order
,
as
he
had
said
,
that
there
might
be
a
home
for
his
cousins
.
<EOS>
But
she
had
expressed
herself
unwilling
to
remain
without
him
,
explaining
that
the
cousins
might
have
the
home
in
her
absence
,
as
well
as
they
could
in
her
presence
;
and
he
had
given
way
.
<EOS>
But
,
in
truth
,
she
had
learned
to
hate
her
cousin
Iphy
Palliser
with
a
hatred
that
was
unreasonable
,
 
seeing
that
she
did
not
also
hate
Alice
Vavasor
,
who
had
done
as
much
to
merit
her
hatred
as
had
her
cousin
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
knew
by
what
means
her
absence
from
Monkshade
had
been
brought
about
.
<EOS>
Miss
Palliser
had
told
her
all
that
had
passed
in
Alice
's
bedroom
on
the
last
night
of
Alice
's
stay
at
Matching
,
and
had
,
by
so
doing
,
contrived
to
prevent
the
visit
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
understood
well
all
that
Alice
had
said
:
and
yet
,
though
she
hated
Miss
Palliser
for
what
had
been
done
,
she
entertained
no
anger
against
Alice
.
<EOS>
Of
course
Alice
would
have
prevented
that
visit
to
Monkshade
if
it
were
in
her
power
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
Of
course
she
would
save
her
friend
.
<EOS>
It
is
hardly
too
much
to
say
that
Lady
Glencora
looked
to
Alice
to
save
her
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
she
hated
Iphy
Palliser
for
engaging
herself
in
the
same
business
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
looked
to
Alice
to
save
her
,
and
yet
it
may
be
doubted
whether
she
did
,
in
truth
,
wish
to
be
saved
.
  
<EOS>
While
she
was
at
Matching
,
and
before
Mr.
Palliser
had
returned
from
Monkshade
,
a
letter
reached
her
,
by
what
means
she
had
never
learned
.
<EOS>
"
A
letter
has
been
placed
within
my
writing
-
case
,
"
she
said
to
her
maid
,
quite
openly
.
<EOS>
"
Who
put
it
there
?
"
<EOS>
The
maid
had
declared
her
ignorance
in
a
manner
that
had
satisfied
Lady
Glencora
of
her
truth
.
<EOS>
"
If
such
a
thing
happens
again
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
,
"
I
shall
be
obliged
to
have
the
matter
investigated
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
allow
that
anything
should
be
put
into
my
room
surreptitiously
.
<EOS>
"
There
,
then
,
had
been
an
end
of
that
,
as
regarded
any
steps
taken
by
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
The
letter
had
been
from
Burgo
Fitzgerald
,
and
had
contained
a
direct
proposal
that
she
should
go
off
with
him
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
at
Matching
,
"
the
letter
said
,
"
at
the
Inn
;
but
I
do
not
dare
to
show
myself
,
lest
I
should
do
you
an
injury
.
<EOS>
I
walked
round
the
house
yesterday
,
at
night
,
and
I
know
that
I
saw
your
room
.
<EOS>
If
I
am
wrong
in
thinking
that
you
love
me
,
I
would
not
for
worlds
insult
you
by
my
presence
;
but
if
you
love
me
still
,
I
ask
you
to
throw
aside
from
you
that
fictitious
marriage
,
and
give
yourself
to
the
man
whom
,
if
you
love
him
,
you
should
regard
as
your
husband
.
<EOS>
"
There
had
been
more
of
it
,
but
it
had
been
to
the
same
effect
.
<EOS>
To
Lady
Glencora
it
had
seemed
to
convey
an
assurance
of
devoted
love
,
 
of
that
love
which
,
in
former
days
,
her
friends
had
told
her
was
not
within
the
compass
of
Burgo
's
nature
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
asked
her
to
meet
him
then
,
but
saying
that
he
would
return
to
Matching
after
Parliament
was
met
,
begged
her
to
let
him
have
some
means
of
knowing
whether
her
heart
was
true
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
She
told
no
one
of
the
letter
,
but
she
kept
it
,
and
read
it
over
and
over
again
in
the
silence
and
solitude
of
her
room
.
<EOS>
She
felt
that
she
was
guilty
in
thus
reading
it
,
 
even
in
keeping
it
from
her
husband
's
knowledge
;
but
though
conscious
of
this
guilt
,
though
resolute
almost
in
its
commission
,
still
she
determined
not
to
remain
at
Matching
after
her
husband
's
departure
,
 
not
to
undergo
the
danger
of
remaining
there
while
Burgo
Fitzgerald
should
be
in
the
vicinity
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
analyse
her
own
wishes
.
<EOS>
She
often
told
herself
,
as
she
had
told
Alice
,
that
it
would
be
better
for
them
all
that
she
should
go
away
;
that
in
throwing
herself
even
to
the
dogs
,
if
such
must
be
the
result
,
she
would
do
more
of
good
than
of
harm
.
<EOS>
She
declared
to
herself
,
in
the
most
passionate
words
she
could
use
,
that
she
loved
this
man
with
all
her
heart
.
<EOS>
She
protested
that
the
fault
would
not
be
hers
,
but
theirs
,
who
had
forced
her
to
marry
the
man
she
did
not
love
.
<EOS>
She
assured
herself
that
her
husband
had
no
affection
for
her
,
and
that
their
marriage
was
in
every
respect
prejudicial
to
him
.
<EOS>
She
recurred
over
and
over
again
,
in
her
thoughts
,
to
her
own
childlessness
,
and
to
his
extreme
desire
for
an
heir
.
"
<EOS>
Though
I
do
sacrifice
myself
,
"
she
would
say
,
"
I
shall
do
more
of
good
than
harm
,
and
I
can
not
be
more
wretched
than
I
am
now
.
"
<EOS>
But
yet
she
fled
to
London
because
she
feared
to
leave
herself
at
Matching
when
Burgo
Fitzgerald
should
be
there
.
<EOS>
She
sent
no
answer
to
his
letter
.
<EOS>
She
made
no
preparation
for
going
with
him
.
<EOS>
She
longed
to
see
Alice
,
to
whom
alone
,
since
her
marriage
,
had
she
ever
spoken
of
her
love
,
and
intended
to
tell
her
the
whole
tale
of
that
letter
.
<EOS>
She
was
as
one
who
,
in
madness
,
was
resolute
to
throw
herself
from
a
precipice
,
but
to
whom
some
remnant
of
sanity
remained
which
forced
her
to
seek
those
who
would
save
her
from
herself
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
had
not
seen
her
since
her
arrival
in
London
,
and
,
of
course
,
he
took
her
by
the
hand
and
kissed
her
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
the
embrace
of
a
brother
rather
than
of
a
lover
or
a
husband
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
,
with
her
full
woman
's
nature
,
understood
this
thoroughly
,
and
appreciated
by
instinct
the
true
bearing
of
every
touch
from
his
hand
.
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
are
well
?
"
<EOS>
she
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
yes
;
quite
well
.
<EOS>
And
you
?
<EOS>
A
little
fatigued
with
your
journey
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
not
much
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
we
have
had
a
debate
on
the
Address
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
want
to
know
how
it
has
gone
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
it
has
concerned
you
particularly
,
I
do
,
of
course
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Concerned
me
!
<EOS>
It
has
concerned
me
certainly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
have
n't
appointed
you
yet
;
have
they
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
they
do
n't
appoint
people
during
debates
,
in
the
House
of
Commons
.
<EOS>
But
I
fear
I
shall
never
make
you
a
politician
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
almost
afraid
you
never
will
.
<EOS>
But
I
'm
not
the
less
anxious
for
your
success
,
since
you
wish
it
yourself
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
understand
why
you
should
work
so
very
hard
;
but
,
as
you
like
it
,
I
'm
as
anxious
as
anybody
can
be
that
you
should
triumph
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
I
do
like
it
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
A
man
must
like
something
,
and
I
do
n't
know
what
there
is
to
like
better
.
<EOS>
Some
people
can
eat
and
drink
all
day
;
and
some
people
can
care
about
a
horse
.
<EOS>
I
can
do
neither
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
there
were
others
,
Lady
Glencora
thought
,
who
could
love
to
lie
in
the
sun
,
and
could
look
up
into
the
eyes
of
women
,
and
seek
their
happiness
there
.
<EOS>
She
was
sure
,
at
any
rate
,
that
she
knew
one
such
.
<EOS>
But
she
said
nothing
of
this
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
spoke
for
a
moment
to
Lord
Brock
,
"
said
Mr.
Palliser
.
<EOS>
Lord
Brock
was
the
name
by
which
the
present
Jove
of
the
Treasury
was
known
among
men
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
did
Lord
Brock
say
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
He
did
n't
say
much
,
but
he
was
very
cordial
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
thought
,
Plantagenet
,
that
he
could
appoint
you
if
he
pleased
?
<EOS>
Does
n't
he
do
it
all
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
in
one
sense
,
he
does
.
<EOS>
But
I
do
n't
suppose
I
shall
ever
make
you
understand

"
<EOS>
He
endeavoured
,
however
,
to
do
so
on
the
present
occasion
,
and
gave
her
a
somewhat
longer
lecture
on
the
working
of
the
British
Constitution
,
and
the
manner
in
which
British
politics
evolved
themselves
,
than
would
have
been
expected
from
most
young
husbands
to
their
young
wives
under
similar
circumstances
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
yawned
,
and
strove
lustily
,
but
ineffectually
,
to
hide
her
yawn
in
her
handkerchief
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
I
see
you
do
n't
care
a
bit
about
it
,
"
said
he
,
peevishly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
be
angry
,
Plantagenet
.
<EOS>
Indeed
I
do
care
about
it
,
but
I
am
so
ignorant
that
I
ca
n't
understand
it
all
at
once
.
<EOS>
I
am
rather
tired
,
and
I
think
I
'll
go
to
bed
now
.
<EOS>
Shall
you
be
late
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
not
very
;
that
is
,
I
shall
be
rather
late
.
<EOS>
I
've
a
lot
of
letters
I
want
to
write
to
-
night
,
as
I
must
be
at
work
all
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
By
-
the
-
by
,
Mr.
Bott
is
coming
to
dine
here
.
<EOS>
There
will
be
no
one
else
.
<EOS>
"
The
next
day
was
a
Wednesday
,
and
the
House
would
not
sit
in
the
evening
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Bott
!
<EOS>
"
said
Lady
Glencora
,
showing
by
her
voice
that
she
anticipated
no
pleasure
from
that
gentleman
's
company
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Mr.
Bott
.
<EOS>
Have
you
any
objection
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
no
.
<EOS>
Would
you
like
to
dine
alone
with
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
should
I
dine
alone
with
him
?
<EOS>
Why
should
n't
you
eat
your
dinner
with
us
?
<EOS>
I
hope
you
are
not
going
to
become
fastidious
,
and
to
turn
up
your
nose
at
people
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Marsham
is
in
town
,
and
I
dare
say
she
'll
come
to
you
if
you
ask
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
But
this
was
too
much
for
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
She
was
disposed
to
be
mild
,
but
she
could
not
endure
to
have
her
two
duennas
thus
brought
upon
her
together
on
the
first
day
of
her
arrival
in
London
.
<EOS>
And
Mrs.
Marsham
would
be
worse
than
Mr.
Bott
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bott
would
be
engaged
with
Mr.
Palliser
during
the
greater
part
of
the
evening
.
<EOS>
"
I
thought
,
"
said
she
,
"
of
asking
my
cousin
,
Alice
Vavasor
,
to
spend
the
evening
with
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Vavasor
!
"
said
the
husband
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
say
that
I
thought
Miss
Vavasor
 
<EOS>
"
He
was
going
to
make
some
allusion
to
that
unfortunate
hour
spent
among
the
ruins
,
but
he
stopped
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
have
nothing
to
say
against
my
cousin
?
"
said
his
wife
.
<EOS>
"
She
is
my
only
near
relative
that
I
really
care
for
;
 
the
only
woman
,
I
mean
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
I
do
n't
mean
to
say
anything
against
her
.
<EOS>
She
's
very
well
as
a
young
lady
,
I
dare
say
.
<EOS>
I
would
sooner
that
you
would
ask
Mrs.
Marsham
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
was
standing
,
waiting
to
go
away
to
her
own
room
,
but
it
was
absolutely
necessary
that
this
matter
should
be
decided
before
she
went
.
<EOS>
She
felt
that
he
was
hard
to
her
,
and
unreasonable
,
and
that
he
was
treating
her
like
a
child
who
should
not
be
allowed
her
own
way
in
anything
.
<EOS>
She
had
endeavoured
to
please
him
,
and
,
having
failed
,
was
not
now
disposed
to
give
way
.
  
<EOS>
"
As
there
will
be
no
other
ladies
here
to
-
morrow
evening
,
Plantagenet
,
and
as
I
have
not
yet
seen
Alice
since
I
have
been
in
town
,
I
wish
you
would
let
me
have
my
way
in
this
.
<EOS>
Of
course
I
can
not
have
very
much
to
say
to
Mrs.
Marsham
,
who
is
an
old
woman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
especially
want
Mrs.
Marsham
to
be
your
friend
,
"
said
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
Friendships
will
not
come
by
ordering
,
Plantagenet
,
"
said
she
.
  
<EOS>
"
Very
well
,
"
said
he
.
<EOS>
"
Of
course
,
you
will
do
as
you
please
.
<EOS>
I
am
sorry
that
you
have
refused
the
first
favour
I
have
asked
you
this
year
.
<EOS>
"
Then
he
left
the
room
,
and
she
went
away
to
bed
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs.
Marsham
.
 
<EOS>
But
Lady
Glencora
was
not
brought
to
repentance
by
her
husband
's
last
words
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
to
her
to
be
so
intolerably
cruel
,
this
demand
of
his
,
that
she
should
be
made
to
pass
the
whole
of
her
first
evening
in
town
with
an
old
woman
for
whom
it
was
impossible
that
she
should
entertain
the
slightest
regard
,
that
she
resolved
upon
rebellion
.
<EOS>
Had
he
positively
ordered
Mrs.
Marsham
,
she
would
have
sent
for
that
lady
,
and
have
contented
herself
with
enduring
her
presence
in
disdainful
silence
;
but
Mr.
Palliser
had
not
given
any
order
.
<EOS>
He
had
made
a
request
,
and
a
request
,
from
its
very
nature
,
admits
of
no
obedience
.
<EOS>
The
compliance
with
a
request
must
be
voluntary
,
and
she
would
not
send
for
Mrs.
Marsham
,
except
upon
compulsion
.
<EOS>
Had
not
she
also
made
a
request
to
him
,
and
had
not
he
refused
it
?
<EOS>
It
was
his
prerogative
,
undoubtedly
,
to
command
;
but
in
that
matter
of
requests
she
had
a
right
to
expect
that
her
voice
should
be
as
potent
as
his
own
.
<EOS>
She
wrote
a
line
,
therefore
,
to
Alice
before
she
went
to
bed
,
begging
her
cousin
to
come
to
her
early
on
the
following
day
,
so
that
they
might
go
out
together
,
and
then
afterwards
dine
in
company
with
Mr.
Bott
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
that
will
be
an
inducement
to
you
,
"
Lady
Glencora
said
,
"
because
your
generous
heart
will
feel
of
what
service
you
may
be
to
me
.
<EOS>
Nobody
else
will
be
here
,
 
unless
,
indeed
,
Mrs.
Marsham
should
be
asked
,
unknown
to
myself
.
"
  
<EOS>
Then
she
sat
herself
down
to
think
,
 
to
think
especially
about
the
cruelty
of
husbands
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
told
over
and
over
again
,
in
the
days
before
her
marriage
,
that
Burgo
would
ill
-
use
her
if
he
became
her
husband
.
<EOS>
The
Marquis
of
Auld
Reekie
had
gone
so
far
as
to
suggest
that
Burgo
might
probably
beat
her
.
<EOS>
But
what
hard
treatment
,
even
what
beating
,
could
be
so
unendurable
as
this
total
want
of
sympathy
,
as
this
deadness
in
life
,
which
her
present
lot
entailed
upon
her
?
<EOS>
As
for
that
matter
of
beating
,
she
ridiculed
the
idea
in
her
very
soul
.
<EOS>
She
sat
smiling
at
the
absurdity
of
the
thing
as
she
thought
of
the
beauty
of
Burgo
's
eyes
,
of
the
softness
of
his
touch
,
of
the
loving
,
almost
worshipping
,
tones
of
his
voice
.
<EOS>
Would
it
not
even
be
better
to
be
beaten
by
him
than
to
have
politics
explained
to
her
at
one
o'clock
at
night
by
such
a
husband
as
Plantagenet
Palliser
?
<EOS>
The
British
Constitution
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
Had
she
married
Burgo
<EOS>
they
would
have
been
in
sunny
Italy
,
and
he
would
have
told
her
some
other
tale
than
that
as
they
sat
together
under
the
pale
moonlight
.
<EOS>
She
had
a
little
water
-
coloured
drawing
called
Raphael
and
Fornarina
,
and
she
was
infantine
enough
to
tell
herself
that
the
so
-
called
Raphael
was
like
her
Burgo
 
<EOS>
no
,
not
her
Burgo
,
but
the
Burgo
that
was
not
hers
.
<EOS>
At
any
rate
,
all
the
romance
of
the
picture
she
might
have
enjoyed
had
they
allowed
her
to
dispose
as
she
had
wished
of
her
own
hand
.
<EOS>
She
might
have
sat
in
marble
balconies
,
while
the
vines
clustered
over
her
head
,
and
he
would
have
been
at
her
knee
,
hardly
speaking
to
her
,
but
making
his
presence
felt
by
the
halo
of
its
divinity
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
called
upon
her
for
no
hard
replies
.
<EOS>
With
him
near
her
she
would
have
enjoyed
the
soft
air
,
and
would
have
sat
happy
,
without
trouble
,
lapped
in
the
delight
of
loving
.
<EOS>
It
was
thus
that
Fornarina
sat
.
<EOS>
And
why
should
not
such
a
lot
have
been
hers
?
<EOS>
Her
Raphael
would
have
loved
her
,
let
them
say
what
they
would
about
his
cruelty
.
  
<EOS>
Poor
,
wretched
,
overburthened
child
,
to
whom
the
commonest
lessons
of
life
had
not
yet
been
taught
,
and
who
had
now
fallen
into
the
hands
of
one
who
was
so
ill
-
fitted
to
teach
them
!
<EOS>
Who
would
not
pity
her
?
<EOS>
Who
could
say
that
the
fault
was
hers
?
<EOS>
The
world
had
laden
her
with
wealth
till
she
had
had
no
limb
free
for
its
ordinary
uses
,
and
then
had
turned
her
loose
to
run
her
race
!
  
<EOS>
"
Have
you
written
to
your
cousin
?
"
<EOS>
her
husband
asked
her
the
next
morning
.
<EOS>
His
voice
,
as
he
spoke
,
clearly
showed
that
his
anger
was
either
over
or
suppressed
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
I
have
asked
her
to
come
and
drive
,
and
then
to
stay
for
dinner
.
<EOS>
I
shall
send
the
carriage
for
her
if
she
can
come
.
<EOS>
The
man
is
to
wait
for
an
answer
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Very
well
,
"
said
Mr.
Palliser
,
mildly
.
<EOS>
And
then
,
after
a
short
pause
,
he
added
,
"
As
that
is
settled
,
perhaps
you
would
have
no
objection
to
ask
Mrs.
Marsham
also
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Wo
n't
she
probably
be
engaged
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
I
think
not
,
"
said
Mr.
Palliser
.
<EOS>
And
then
he
added
,
being
ashamed
of
the
tinge
of
falsehood
of
which
he
would
otherwise
have
been
guilty
,
"
I
know
she
is
not
engaged
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
expects
to
come
,
then
?
"
said
Lady
Glencora
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
asked
her
,
if
you
mean
that
,
Glencora
.
<EOS>
Had
I
done
so
<EOS>
,
I
should
have
said
so
.
<EOS>
I
told
her
that
I
did
not
know
what
your
engagements
were
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
write
to
her
,
if
you
please
,
"
said
the
wife
,
who
felt
that
she
could
hardly
refuse
any
longer
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
,
my
dear
!
"
said
the
husband
.
<EOS>
So
Lady
Glencora
did
write
to
Mrs.
Marsham
,
who
promised
to
come
,
 
as
did
also
Alice
Vavasor
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
would
,
at
any
rate
,
have
Alice
to
herself
for
some
hours
before
dinner
.
<EOS>
At
first
she
took
comfort
in
that
reflection
;
but
after
a
while
she
bethought
herself
that
she
would
not
know
what
to
tell
Alice
,
or
what
not
to
tell
.
<EOS>
Did
she
mean
to
show
that
letter
to
her
cousin
?
<EOS>
If
she
did
show
it
,
then
,
 
so
she
argued
with
herself
,
 
she
must
bring
herself
to
endure
the
wretchedness
of
her
present
lot
,
and
must
give
up
for
ever
all
her
dreams
about
Raphael
and
Fornarina
.
<EOS>
If
she
did
not
show
it
,
 
or
,
at
any
rate
,
tell
of
it
,
 
then
it
would
come
to
pass
that
she
would
leave
her
husband
under
the
protection
of
another
man
,
and
she
would
become
 
what
she
did
not
dare
to
name
even
to
herself
.
<EOS>
She
declared
that
so
it
must
be
.
<EOS>
She
knew
that
she
would
go
with
Burgo
,
should
he
ever
come
to
her
with
the
means
of
going
at
his
and
her
instant
command
.
<EOS>
But
should
she
bring
herself
to
let
Alice
know
that
such
a
letter
had
been
conveyed
to
her
,
Burgo
would
never
have
such
power
.
  
<EOS>
I
remember
the
story
of
a
case
of
abduction
in
which
a
man
was
tried
for
his
life
,
and
was
acquitted
,
because
the
lady
had
acquiesced
in
the
carrying
away
while
it
was
in
progress
.
<EOS>
She
had
,
as
she
herself
declared
,
armed
herself
with
a
sure
and
certain
charm
or
talisman
against
such
dangers
,
which
she
kept
suspended
round
her
neck
;
but
whilst
she
was
in
the
post
-
chaise
she
opened
the
window
and
threw
the
charm
from
her
,
no
longer
desiring
,
as
the
learned
counsel
for
the
defence
efficiently
alleged
,
to
be
kept
under
the
bonds
of
such
protection
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
's
state
of
mind
was
,
in
its
nature
,
nearly
the
same
as
that
of
the
lady
in
the
post
-
chaise
.
<EOS>
Whether
or
no
she
would
use
her
charm
,
she
had
not
yet
decided
,
but
the
power
of
doing
so
was
still
hers
.
  
<EOS>
Alice
came
,
and
the
greeting
between
the
cousins
was
very
affectionate
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
received
her
as
though
they
had
been
playmates
from
early
childhood
;
and
Alice
,
though
such
impulsive
love
was
not
natural
to
her
as
to
the
other
,
could
not
bring
herself
to
be
cold
to
one
who
was
so
warm
to
her
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
had
she
not
promised
her
love
in
that
meeting
at
Matching
Priory
in
which
her
cousin
had
told
her
of
all
her
wretchedness
?
<EOS>
"
I
will
love
you
!
"
<EOS>
Alice
had
said
;
and
though
there
was
much
in
Lady
Glencora
that
she
could
not
approve
,
 
much
even
that
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
like
,
 
still
she
would
not
allow
her
heart
to
contradict
her
words
.
  
<EOS>
They
sat
so
long
over
the
fire
in
the
drawing
-
room
that
at
last
they
agreed
that
the
driving
should
be
abandoned
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
use
of
it
?
"
said
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
"
There
's
nothing
to
see
,
and
the
wind
is
as
cold
as
charity
.
<EOS>
We
are
much
more
comfortable
here
;
are
we
not
?
"
<EOS>
Alice
quite
acquiesced
in
this
,
having
no
great
desire
to
be
driven
through
the
parks
in
the
gloom
of
a
February
afternoon
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
had
Dandy
and
Flirt
up
here
,
there
would
be
some
fun
in
it
;
but
Mr.
Palliser
does
n't
wish
me
to
drive
in
London
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
it
would
be
dangerous
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Not
in
the
least
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
think
it
's
that
he
minds
;
but
he
has
an
idea
that
it
looks
fast
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
So
it
does
.
<EOS>
If
I
were
a
man
,
I
'm
sure
I
should
n't
like
my
wife
to
drive
horses
about
London
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
why
not
?
<EOS>
Just
because
you
'd
be
a
tyrant
,
 
like
other
husbands
?
<EOS>
What
's
the
harm
of
looking
fast
,
if
one
does
n't
do
anything
improper
?
<EOS>
Poor
Dandy
,
and
dear
Flirt
!
<EOS>
I
'm
sure
they
'd
like
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
Mr.
Palliser
does
n't
care
for
that
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
tell
you
something
else
he
does
n't
care
for
.
<EOS>
He
does
n't
care
whether
Dandy
's
mistress
likes
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
n't
say
that
,
Glencora
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
not
say
it
,
 
to
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
n't
teach
yourself
to
think
it
.
<EOS>
That
's
what
I
mean
.
<EOS>
I
believe
he
would
consent
to
anything
that
he
did
n't
think
wrong
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Such
as
lectures
about
the
British
Constitution
!
<EOS>
But
never
mind
about
that
,
Alice
.
<EOS>
Of
course
the
British
Constitution
is
everything
to
him
,
and
I
wish
I
knew
more
about
it
;
 
that
's
all
.
<EOS>
But
I
have
n't
told
you
whom
you
are
to
meet
at
dinner
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
you
have
 
Mr.
Bott
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
there
's
another
guest
,
a
Mrs.
Marsham
.
<EOS>
I
thought
I
'd
got
rid
of
her
for
to
-
day
,
when
I
wrote
to
you
;
but
I
had
n't
.
<EOS>
She
's
coming
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
wo
n't
hurt
me
at
all
,
"
said
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
will
hurt
me
very
much
.
<EOS>
She
'll
destroy
the
pleasure
of
our
whole
evening
.
<EOS>
I
do
believe
that
she
hates
you
,
and
that
she
thinks
you
instigate
me
to
all
manner
of
iniquity
.
<EOS>
What
fools
they
all
are
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Who
are
they
all
,
Glencora
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
and
that
man
,
and
 
.
<EOS>
Never
mind
.
<EOS>
It
makes
me
sick
when
I
think
that
they
should
be
so
blind
.
<EOS>
Alice
,
I
hardly
know
how
much
I
owe
to
you
;
I
do
n't
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
Everything
,
I
believe
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
,
as
she
spoke
,
put
her
hand
into
her
pocket
,
and
grasped
the
letter
which
lay
there
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
nonsense
,
"
said
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
it
's
not
nonsense
.
<EOS>
Who
do
you
think
came
to
Matching
when
I
was
there
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
;
 
to
the
house
?
"
said
Alice
,
feeling
almost
certain
that
Mr.
Fitzgerald
was
the
person
to
whom
Lady
Glencora
was
alluding
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
not
to
the
house
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
it
is
the
person
of
whom
I
am
thinking
,
"
said
Alice
,
solemnly
,
"
let
me
implore
you
not
to
speak
of
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
why
should
I
not
speak
of
him
?
<EOS>
Did
I
not
speak
of
him
before
to
you
,
and
was
it
not
for
good
?
<EOS>
How
are
you
to
be
my
friend
,
if
I
may
not
speak
to
you
of
everything
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
should
not
think
of
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
nonsense
you
talk
,
Alice
!
<EOS>
Not
think
of
him
!
<EOS>
How
is
one
to
help
one
's
thoughts
?
<EOS>
Look
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Her
hand
was
on
the
letter
,
and
it
would
have
been
out
in
a
moment
,
and
thrown
upon
Alice
's
lap
,
had
not
the
servant
opened
the
door
and
announced
Mrs.
Marsham
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
how
I
do
wish
we
had
gone
to
drive
!
"
said
Lady
Glencora
,
in
a
voice
which
the
servant
certainly
heard
,
and
which
Mrs.
Marsham
would
have
heard
had
she
not
been
a
little
hard
of
hearing
,
 
in
her
bonnet
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
do
,
my
dear
?
"
said
Mrs.
Marsham
.
<EOS>
"
I
thought
I
'd
just
come
across
from
Norfolk
Street
and
see
you
,
though
I
am
coming
to
dinner
in
the
evening
.
<EOS>
It
's
only
just
a
step
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
How
d'ye
do
,
Miss
Vavasor
?
"
<EOS>
and
she
made
a
salutation
to
Alice
which
was
nearly
as
cold
as
it
could
be
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Marsham
was
a
woman
who
had
many
good
points
.
<EOS>
She
was
poor
,
and
bore
her
poverty
without
complaint
<EOS>
She
was
connected
by
blood
and
friendship
with
people
rich
and
titled
;
but
she
paid
to
none
of
them
egregious
respect
on
account
of
their
wealth
or
titles
.
<EOS>
She
was
staunch
in
her
friendships
,
and
staunch
in
her
enmities
.
<EOS>
She
was
no
fool
,
and
knew
well
what
was
going
on
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
She
could
talk
about
the
last
novel
,
or
 
if
need
be
 
about
the
Constitution
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
a
true
wife
,
though
sometimes
too
strong
-
minded
,
and
a
painstaking
mother
,
whose
children
,
however
,
had
never
loved
her
as
most
mothers
like
to
be
loved
.
  
<EOS>
The
catalogue
of
her
faults
must
be
quite
as
long
as
that
of
her
virtues
.
<EOS>
She
was
one
of
those
women
who
are
ambitious
of
power
,
and
not
very
scrupulous
as
to
the
manner
in
which
they
obtain
it
.
<EOS>
She
was
hardhearted
,
and
capable
of
pursuing
an
object
without
much
regard
to
the
injury
she
might
do
.
<EOS>
She
would
not
flatter
wealth
or
fawn
before
a
title
,
but
she
was
not
above
any
artifice
by
which
she
might
ingratiate
herself
with
those
whom
it
suited
her
purpose
to
conciliate
.
<EOS>
She
thought
evil
rather
than
good
.
<EOS>
She
was
herself
untrue
in
action
,
if
not
absolutely
in
word
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
say
that
she
would
coin
lies
,
but
she
would
willingly
leave
false
impressions
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
the
bosom
friend
,
and
in
many
things
the
guide
in
life
,
of
Mr.
Palliser
's
mother
;
and
she
took
a
special
interest
in
Mr.
Palliser
's
welfare
.
<EOS>
When
he
married
,
she
heard
the
story
of
the
loves
of
Burgo
and
Lady
Glencora
;
and
though
she
thought
well
of
the
money
,
she
was
not
disposed
to
think
very
well
of
the
bride
.
<EOS>
She
made
up
her
mind
that
the
young
lady
would
want
watching
,
and
she
was
of
opinion
that
no
one
would
be
so
well
able
to
watch
Lady
Glencora
as
herself
.
<EOS>
She
had
not
plainly
opened
her
mind
on
this
matter
to
Mr.
Palliser
;
she
had
not
made
any
distinct
suggestion
to
him
that
she
would
act
as
Argus
to
his
wife
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
would
have
rejected
any
such
suggestion
,
and
Mrs.
Marsham
knew
that
he
would
do
so
;
but
she
had
let
a
word
or
two
drop
,
hinting
that
Lady
Glencora
was
very
young
,
 
hinting
that
Lady
Glencora
's
manners
were
charming
in
their
childlike
simplicity
;
but
hinting
also
that
precaution
was
,
for
that
reason
,
the
more
necessary
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
,
who
suspected
nothing
as
to
Burgo
or
as
to
any
other
special
peril
,
whose
whole
disposition
was
void
of
suspicion
,
whose
dry
nature
realized
neither
the
delights
nor
the
dangers
of
love
,
acknowledged
that
Glencora
was
young
.
<EOS>
He
especially
wished
that
she
should
be
discreet
and
matronly
;
he
feared
no
lovers
,
but
he
feared
that
she
might
do
silly
things
,
 
that
she
would
catch
cold
,
 
and
not
know
how
to
live
a
life
becoming
the
wife
of
a
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
.
<EOS>
Therefore
he
submitted
Glencora
,
 
and
,
to
a
certain
extent
,
himself
,
 
into
the
hands
of
Mrs.
Marsham
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
had
not
been
twenty
-
four
hours
in
the
house
with
this
lady
before
she
recognized
in
her
a
duenna
.
<EOS>
In
all
such
matters
no
one
could
be
quicker
than
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
She
might
be
very
ignorant
about
the
British
Constitution
,
and
,
alas
!
<EOS>
very
ignorant
also
as
to
the
real
elements
of
right
and
wrong
in
a
woman
's
conduct
,
but
she
was
no
fool
.
<EOS>
She
had
an
eye
that
could
see
,
and
an
ear
that
could
understand
,
and
an
abundance
of
that
feminine
instinct
which
teaches
a
woman
to
know
her
friend
or
her
enemy
at
a
glance
,
at
a
touch
,
at
a
word
.
<EOS>
In
many
things
Lady
Glencora
was
much
quicker
,
much
more
clever
,
than
her
husband
,
though
he
was
to
be
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
,
and
though
she
did
know
nothing
of
the
Constitution
.
<EOS>
She
knew
,
too
,
that
he
was
easily
to
be
deceived
,
 
that
though
his
intelligence
was
keen
,
his
instincts
were
dull
,
 
that
he
was
gifted
with
no
fineness
of
touch
,
with
no
subtle
appreciation
of
the
characters
of
men
and
women
;
and
,
to
a
certain
extent
,
she
looked
down
upon
him
for
his
obtusity
.
<EOS>
He
should
have
been
aware
that
Burgo
was
a
danger
to
be
avoided
;
and
he
should
have
been
aware
also
that
Mrs.
Marsham
was
a
duenna
not
to
be
employed
.
<EOS>
When
a
woman
knows
that
she
is
guarded
by
a
watch
-
dog
,
she
is
bound
to
deceive
her
Cerberus
,
if
it
be
possible
,
and
is
usually
not
ill
-
disposed
to
deceive
also
the
owner
of
Cerberus
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
felt
that
Mrs.
Marsham
was
her
Cerberus
,
and
she
was
heartily
resolved
that
if
she
was
to
be
kept
in
the
proper
line
at
all
,
she
would
not
be
so
kept
by
Mrs.
Marsham
.
  
<EOS>
Alice
rose
and
accepted
Mrs.
Marsham
's
salutation
quite
as
coldly
as
it
had
been
given
,
and
from
that
time
forward
those
two
ladies
were
enemies
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Marsham
,
groping
quite
in
the
dark
,
partly
guessed
that
Alice
had
in
some
way
interfered
to
prevent
Lady
Glencora
's
visit
to
Monkshade
,
and
,
though
such
prevention
was
,
no
doubt
,
good
in
that
lady
's
eyes
,
she
resented
the
interference
.
<EOS>
She
had
made
up
her
mind
that
Alice
was
not
the
sort
of
friend
that
Lady
Glencora
should
have
about
her
.
<EOS>
Alice
recognized
and
accepted
the
feud
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
thought
I
might
find
you
at
home
,
"
said
Mrs.
Marsham
,
"
as
I
know
you
are
lazy
about
going
out
in
the
cold
,
 
unless
it
be
for
a
foolish
midnight
ramble
,
"
and
Mrs.
Marsham
shook
her
head
.
<EOS>
She
was
a
little
woman
,
with
sharp
small
eyes
,
with
a
permanent
colour
in
her
face
,
and
two
short
,
crisp
,
grey
curls
at
each
side
of
her
face
;
always
well
dressed
,
always
in
good
health
,
and
,
as
Lady
Glencora
believed
,
altogether
incapable
of
fatigue
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
ramble
you
speak
of
was
very
wise
,
I
think
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
;
"
but
I
never
could
see
the
use
of
driving
about
in
London
in
the
middle
of
winter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
One
ought
to
go
out
of
the
house
every
day
,
"
said
Mrs.
Marsham
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hate
all
those
rules
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
,
Alice
?
<EOS>
"
Alice
did
not
hate
them
,
therefore
she
said
nothing
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Glencora
,
one
must
live
by
rules
in
this
life
.
<EOS>
You
might
as
well
say
that
you
hated
sitting
down
to
dinner
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
So
I
do
,
very
often
;
almost
always
when
there
's
company
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
'll
get
over
that
feeling
after
another
season
in
town
,
"
said
Mrs.
Marsham
,
pretending
to
suppose
that
Lady
Glencora
alluded
to
some
remaining
timidity
in
receiving
her
own
guests
.
  
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
word
I
do
n't
think
I
shall
.
<EOS>
It
's
a
thing
that
seems
always
to
be
getting
more
grievous
,
instead
of
less
so
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bott
is
coming
to
dine
here
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
no
mistaking
the
meaning
of
this
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
pretending
even
to
mistake
it
.
<EOS>
Now
,
Mrs.
Marsham
had
accepted
the
right
hand
of
fellowship
from
Mr.
Bott
,
 
not
because
she
especially
liked
him
,
but
in
compliance
with
the
apparent
necessities
of
Mr.
Palliser
's
position
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bott
had
made
good
his
ground
about
Mr.
Palliser
;
and
Mrs.
Marsham
,
as
she
was
not
strong
enough
to
turn
him
off
from
it
,
had
given
him
the
right
hand
of
fellowship
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Bott
is
a
Member
of
Parliament
,
and
a
very
serviceable
friend
of
Mr.
Palliser
's
,
"
said
Mrs.
Marsham
.
  
<EOS>
"
All
the
same
;
we
do
not
like
<EOS>
Mr.
Bott
 
<EOS>
do
we
,
Alice
?
<EOS>
He
is
Doctor
Fell
to
us
;
only
I
think
we
could
tell
why
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
certainly
do
not
like
him
,
"
said
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
can
be
but
of
small
matter
to
you
,
Miss
Vavasor
,
"
said
Mrs.
Marsham
,
"
as
you
will
not
probably
have
to
see
much
of
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Of
the
very
smallest
moment
,
"
said
Alice
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
did
annoy
me
once
,
but
will
never
,
I
dare
say
,
have
an
opportunity
of
doing
so
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
what
the
annoyance
may
have
been
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
you
do
n't
,
Mrs.
Marsham
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
should
n't
have
thought
it
likely
that
a
person
so
fully
employed
as
Mr.
Bott
,
and
employed
,
too
,
on
matters
of
such
vast
importance
,
would
have
gone
out
of
his
way
to
annoy
a
young
lady
whom
he
chanced
to
meet
for
a
day
or
two
in
a
country
-
house
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
that
Alice
means
that
he
attempted
to
flirt
with
her
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
,
laughing
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Fancy
Mr.
Bott
's
flirtation
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
he
did
not
attempt
,
"
said
Mrs.
Marsham
;
and
the
words
,
the
tone
,
and
the
innuendo
together
were
more
than
Alice
was
able
to
bear
with
equanimity
.
  
<EOS>
"
Glencora
,
"
said
she
,
rising
from
her
chair
,
"
I
think
I
'll
leave
you
alone
with
Mrs.
Marsham
.
<EOS>
I
'm
not
disposed
to
discuss
Mr.
Bott
's
character
,
and
certainly
not
to
hear
his
name
mentioned
in
disagreeable
connection
with
my
own
.
"
  
<EOS>
But
Lady
Glencora
would
not
let
her
go
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Nonsense
,
Alice
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
and
I
ca
n't
fight
our
little
battles
against
Mr.
Bott
and
Mrs.
Marsham
without
running
away
,
it
is
odd
.
<EOS>
There
is
a
warfare
in
which
they
who
run
away
never
live
to
fight
another
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
,
Glencora
,
you
do
not
count
me
as
your
enemy
?
"
said
Mrs.
Marsham
,
drawing
herself
up
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
shall
,
 
certainly
,
if
you
attack
Alice
.
<EOS>
Love
me
,
love
my
dog
.
<EOS>
I
beg
your
pardon
,
Alice
;
but
what
I
meant
was
this
,
Mrs.
Marsham
;
Love
me
,
love
the
best
friend
I
have
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
not
mean
to
offend
Miss
Vavasor
,
"
said
Mrs.
Marsham
,
looking
at
her
very
grimly
.
<EOS>
Alice
merely
bowed
her
head
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
offended
,
and
she
would
not
deny
it
.
<EOS>
After
that
,
Mrs.
Marsham
took
herself
off
,
saying
that
she
would
be
back
to
dinner
.
<EOS>
She
was
angry
,
but
not
unhappy
.
<EOS>
She
thought
that
she
could
put
down
Miss
Vavasor
,
and
she
was
prepared
to
bear
a
good
deal
from
Lady
Glencora
 
for
Mr.
Palliser
's
sake
,
as
she
said
to
herself
,
with
some
attempt
at
a
sentimental
remembrance
of
her
old
friend
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
's
a
nasty
old
cat
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
,
as
soon
as
the
door
was
closed
;
and
she
said
these
words
with
so
droll
a
voice
,
with
such
a
childlike
shaking
of
her
head
,
with
so
much
comedy
in
her
grimace
,
that
Alice
could
not
but
laugh
.
<EOS>
"
She
is
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
her
,
and
you
'll
have
to
know
her
,
too
,
before
you
've
done
with
her
.
<EOS>
It
wo
n't
at
all
do
for
you
to
run
away
when
she
spits
at
you
.
<EOS>
You
must
hold
your
ground
,
and
show
your
claws
,
 
and
make
her
know
that
if
she
spits
,
you
can
scratch
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
do
n't
want
to
be
a
cat
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
'll
find
I
'm
of
the
genus
,
but
of
the
tiger
kind
,
if
she
persecutes
me
.
<EOS>
Alice
,
there
's
one
thing
I
have
made
up
my
mind
about
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
be
persecuted
.
<EOS>
If
my
husband
tells
me
to
do
anything
,
as
long
as
he
is
my
husband
I
'll
do
it
;
but
I
wo
n't
be
persecuted
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
should
remember
that
she
was
a
very
old
friend
of
Mr.
Palliser
's
mother
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
remember
;
and
that
may
be
a
very
good
reason
why
she
should
come
here
occasionally
,
or
go
to
Matching
,
or
to
any
place
in
which
we
may
be
living
.
<EOS>
It
's
a
bore
,
of
course
;
but
it
's
a
natural
bore
,
and
one
that
ought
to
be
borne
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
that
will
be
the
beginning
and
the
end
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
afraid
not
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
It
may
perhaps
be
the
end
of
it
,
but
I
fear
it
wo
n't
be
the
beginning
.
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
be
persecuted
.
<EOS>
If
she
gives
me
advice
,
I
shall
tell
her
to
her
face
that
it
's
not
wanted
;
and
if
she
insults
any
friend
of
mine
,
as
she
did
you
,
I
shall
tell
her
that
she
had
better
stay
away
.
<EOS>
She
'll
go
and
tell
him
,
of
course
;
but
I
ca
n't
help
that
.
<EOS>
I
've
made
up
my
mind
that
I
wo
n't
be
persecuted
.
"
  
<EOS>
After
that
,
Lady
Glencora
felt
no
further
inclination
to
show
Burgo
's
letter
to
Alice
on
that
occasion
.
<EOS>
They
sat
over
the
drawing
-
room
fire
,
talking
chiefly
of
Alice
's
affairs
,
till
it
was
time
for
them
to
dress
.
<EOS>
But
Alice
,
though
she
spoke
much
of
Mr.
Grey
,
said
no
word
as
to
her
engagement
with
George
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
How
could
she
speak
of
it
,
inasmuch
as
she
had
already
resolved
,
 
already
almost
resolved
,
 
that
that
engagement
also
should
be
broken
?
  
<EOS>
Alice
,
when
she
came
down
to
the
drawing
-
room
,
before
dinner
,
found
Mr.
Bott
there
alone
.
<EOS>
She
had
dressed
more
quickly
than
her
friend
,
and
Mr.
Palliser
had
not
yet
made
his
appearance
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
not
expect
the
pleasure
of
meeting
Miss
Vavasor
to
-
day
,
"
he
said
,
as
he
came
up
,
offering
his
hand
.
<EOS>
She
gave
him
her
hand
,
and
then
sat
down
,
merely
muttering
some
word
of
reply
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
spent
a
very
pleasant
month
down
at
Matching
together
;
 
did
n't
you
think
so
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
spent
a
pleasant
month
there
certainly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
left
,
if
I
remember
,
the
morning
after
that
late
walk
out
among
the
ruins
?
<EOS>
That
was
unfortunate
,
was
it
not
?
<EOS>
Poor
Lady
Glencora
!
<EOS>
it
made
her
very
ill
;
so
much
so
,
that
she
could
not
go
to
Monkshade
,
as
she
particularly
wished
.
<EOS>
It
was
very
sad
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
is
very
delicate
,
 
very
delicate
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
We
,
who
have
the
privilege
of
being
near
her
,
ought
always
to
remember
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
she
is
at
all
delicate
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
do
n't
you
?
<EOS>
I
'm
afraid
that
's
your
mistake
,
Miss
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
she
has
very
good
health
,
which
is
the
greatest
blessing
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
By
delicate
I
suppose
you
mean
weak
and
infirm
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
dear
,
no
,
 
not
in
the
least
,
 
not
infirm
certainly
!
<EOS>
I
should
be
very
sorry
to
be
supposed
to
have
said
that
Lady
Glencora
is
infirm
.
<EOS>
What
I
mean
is
,
not
robust
,
Miss
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
Her
general
organization
,
if
you
understand
me
,
is
exquisitely
delicate
.
<EOS>
One
can
see
that
,
I
think
,
in
every
glance
of
her
eye
.
"
  
<EOS>
Alice
was
going
to
protest
that
she
had
never
seen
it
at
all
,
when
Mr.
Palliser
entered
the
room
along
with
Mrs.
Marsham
.
  
<EOS>
The
two
gentlemen
shook
hands
,
and
then
Mr.
Palliser
turned
to
Alice
.
<EOS>
She
perceived
at
once
by
his
face
that
she
was
unwelcome
,
and
wished
herself
away
from
his
house
.
<EOS>
It
might
be
all
very
well
for
Lady
Glencora
to
fight
with
Mrs.
Marsham
,
 
and
with
her
husband
,
too
,
in
regard
to
the
Marsham
persecution
,
 
but
there
could
be
no
reason
why
she
should
do
so
.
<EOS>
He
just
touched
her
hand
,
barely
closing
his
thumb
upon
her
fingers
,
and
asked
her
how
she
was
.
<EOS>
Then
he
turned
away
from
her
side
of
the
fire
,
and
began
talking
to
Mrs.
Marsham
on
the
other
.
<EOS>
There
was
that
in
his
face
and
in
his
manner
which
was
positively
offensive
to
her
.
<EOS>
He
made
no
allusion
to
his
former
acquaintance
with
her
,
 
spoke
no
word
about
Matching
,
no
word
about
his
wife
,
as
he
would
naturally
have
done
to
his
wife
's
friend
.
<EOS>
Alice
felt
the
blood
mount
into
her
face
,
and
regretted
greatly
that
she
had
ever
come
among
these
people
.
<EOS>
Had
she
not
long
since
made
up
her
mind
that
she
would
avoid
her
great
relations
,
and
did
not
all
this
prove
that
it
would
have
been
well
for
her
to
have
clung
to
that
resolution
?
<EOS>
What
was
Lady
Glencora
to
her
that
she
should
submit
herself
to
be
treated
as
though
she
were
a
poor
companion
,
 
a
dependent
,
who
received
a
salary
for
her
attendance
,
 
an
indigent
cousin
,
hanging
on
to
the
bounty
of
her
rich
connection
?
<EOS>
Alice
was
proud
to
a
fault
.
<EOS>
She
had
nursed
her
pride
till
it
was
very
faulty
.
<EOS>
All
her
troubles
and
sorrows
in
life
had
come
from
an
overfed
craving
for
independence
.
<EOS>
Why
,
then
,
should
she
submit
to
be
treated
with
open
want
of
courtesy
by
any
man
;
but
,
of
all
men
,
why
should
she
submit
to
it
from
such
a
one
as
Mr.
Palliser
,
 
the
heir
of
a
ducal
house
,
rolling
in
wealth
,
and
magnificent
with
all
the
magnificence
of
British
pomp
and
pride
?
<EOS>
No
;
she
would
make
Lady
Glencora
understand
that
the
close
intimacies
of
daily
life
were
not
possible
to
them
!
  
<EOS>
"
I
declare
I
'm
very
much
ashamed
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
,
as
she
entered
the
room
.
<EOS>
"
I
sha
n't
apologize
to
you
,
Alice
,
for
it
was
you
who
kept
me
talking
;
but
I
do
beg
Mrs.
Marsham
's
pardon
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Marsham
was
all
smiles
and
forgiveness
,
and
hoped
that
Lady
Glencora
would
not
make
a
stranger
of
her
.
<EOS>
Then
dinner
was
announced
,
and
Alice
had
to
walk
down
stairs
by
herself
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
care
a
doit
for
that
,
but
there
had
been
a
disagreeable
little
contest
when
the
moment
came
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
had
wished
to
give
up
Mr.
Bott
to
her
cousin
,
but
Mr.
Bott
had
stuck
manfully
to
Lady
Glencora
's
side
.
<EOS>
He
hoped
to
take
Lady
Glencora
down
to
dinner
very
often
,
and
was
not
at
all
disposed
to
abate
his
privilege
.
  
<EOS>
During
dinner
-
time
Alice
said
very
little
,
nor
was
there
given
to
her
opportunity
of
saying
much
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
but
think
of
the
day
of
her
first
arrival
at
Matching
Priory
,
when
she
had
sat
between
the
Duke
of
St.
Bungay
and
Jeffrey
Palliser
,
and
when
everybody
had
been
so
civil
to
her
!
<EOS>
She
now
occupied
one
side
of
the
table
by
herself
,
away
from
the
fire
,
where
she
felt
cold
and
desolate
in
the
gloom
of
the
large
half
-
lighted
room
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
occupied
himself
with
Mrs.
Marsham
,
who
talked
politics
to
him
;
and
Mr.
Bott
never
lost
a
moment
in
his
endeavours
to
say
some
civil
word
to
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
gave
him
no
encouragement
;
but
she
hardly
dared
to
snub
him
openly
in
her
husband
's
immediate
presence
.
<EOS>
Twenty
times
during
dinner
she
said
some
little
word
to
Alice
,
attempting
at
first
to
make
the
time
pleasant
,
and
then
,
when
the
matter
was
too
far
gone
for
that
,
attempting
to
give
some
relief
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
of
no
avail
.
<EOS>
There
are
moments
in
which
conversation
seems
to
be
impossible
,
 
in
which
the
very
gods
interfere
to
put
a
seal
upon
the
lips
of
the
unfortunate
one
.
<EOS>
It
was
such
a
moment
now
with
Alice
.
<EOS>
She
had
never
as
yet
been
used
to
snubbing
.
<EOS>
Whatever
position
she
had
hitherto
held
,
in
that
she
had
always
stood
foremost
,
 
much
more
so
than
had
been
good
for
her
.
<EOS>
When
she
had
gone
to
Matching
,
she
had
trembled
for
her
position
;
but
there
all
had
gone
well
with
her
;
there
Lady
Glencora
's
kindness
had
at
first
been
able
to
secure
for
her
a
reception
that
had
been
flattering
,
and
almost
better
than
flattering
.
<EOS>
Jeffrey
Palliser
had
been
her
friend
,
and
would
,
had
she
so
willed
it
,
have
been
more
than
her
friend
.
<EOS>
But
now
she
felt
that
the
halls
of
the
Pallisers
were
too
cold
for
her
,
and
that
the
sooner
she
escaped
from
their
gloom
and
hard
discourtesy
the
better
for
her
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Marsham
,
when
the
three
ladies
had
returned
to
the
drawing
-
room
together
,
was
a
little
triumphant
.
<EOS>
She
felt
that
she
had
put
Alice
down
;
and
with
the
energetic
prudence
of
a
good
general
who
knows
that
he
should
follow
up
a
victory
,
let
the
cost
of
doing
so
be
what
it
may
,
she
determined
to
keep
her
down
.
<EOS>
Alice
had
resolved
that
she
would
come
as
seldom
as
might
be
to
Mr.
Palliser
's
house
in
Park
Lane
.
<EOS>
That
resolution
on
her
part
was
in
close
accordance
with
Mrs.
Marsham
's
own
views
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
Miss
Vavasor
going
to
walk
home
?
<EOS>
"
she
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
Walk
home
;
 
all
along
Oxford
Street
!
<EOS>
Good
gracious
!
<EOS>
no
.
<EOS>
Why
should
she
walk
?
<EOS>
The
carriage
will
take
her
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
Or

"
said
Alice
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
quite
used
to
go
about
London
in
a
cab
by
myself
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
they
are
nice
for
young
ladies
after
dark
,
"
said
Mrs.
Marsham
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
going
to
offer
my
servant
to
walk
with
her
.
<EOS>
She
is
an
elderly
woman
,
and
would
not
mind
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
sure
Alice
is
very
much
obliged
,
"
said
Lady
.
<EOS>
Glencora
;
"
but
she
will
have
the
carriage
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
very
good
-
natured
,
"
said
Mrs.
Marsham
;
"
but
gentlemen
do
so
dislike
having
their
horses
out
at
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
No
gentleman
's
horses
will
be
out
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
,
savagely
;
"
and
as
for
mine
,
it
's
what
they
are
there
for
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
not
often
that
Lady
Glencora
made
any
allusion
to
her
own
property
,
or
allowed
any
one
near
her
to
suppose
that
she
remembered
the
fact
that
her
husband
's
great
wealth
was
,
in
truth
,
her
wealth
.
<EOS>
As
to
many
matters
her
mind
was
wrong
.
<EOS>
In
some
things
her
taste
was
not
delicate
as
should
be
that
of
a
woman
.
<EOS>
But
,
as
regarded
her
money
,
no
woman
could
have
behaved
with
greater
reticence
,
or
a
purer
delicacy
.
<EOS>
But
now
,
when
she
was
twitted
by
her
husband
's
special
friend
with
ill
-
usage
to
her
husband
's
horses
,
because
she
chose
to
send
her
own
friend
home
in
her
own
carriage
,
she
did
find
it
hard
to
bear
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
dare
say
it
's
all
right
,
"
said
Mrs.
Marsham
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
all
right
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
has
given
me
my
horses
for
my
own
use
,
to
do
as
I
like
with
them
;
and
if
he
thinks
I
take
them
out
when
they
ought
to
be
left
at
home
,
he
can
tell
me
so
.
<EOS>
Nobody
else
has
a
right
to
do
it
.
"
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
,
by
this
time
,
was
almost
in
a
passion
,
and
showed
that
she
was
so
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Lady
Glencora
,
you
have
mistaken
me
,
"
said
Mrs.
Marsham
;
"
I
did
not
mean
anything
of
that
kind
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
so
sorry
,
"
said
Alice
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
it
is
such
a
pity
,
as
I
am
quite
used
to
going
about
in
cabs
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
you
are
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
"
Why
should
n't
you
?
<EOS>
I
'd
go
home
in
a
wheelbarrow
if
I
could
n't
walk
,
and
had
no
other
conveyance
.
<EOS>
That
's
not
the
question
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Marsham
understands
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Upon
my
word
,
I
do
n't
understand
anything
,
"
said
that
lady
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
understand
this
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
;
"
that
in
all
such
matters
as
that
,
I
intend
to
follow
my
own
pleasure
.
<EOS>
Come
,
Alice
,
let
us
have
some
coffee
,
"
 
<EOS>
and
she
rang
the
bell
.
<EOS>
"
What
a
fuss
we
have
made
about
a
stupid
old
carriage
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
gentlemen
did
not
return
to
the
drawing
-
room
that
evening
,
having
,
no
doubt
,
joint
work
to
do
in
arranging
the
great
financial
calculations
of
the
nation
;
and
,
at
an
early
hour
,
Alice
was
taken
home
in
Lady
Glencora
's
brougham
,
leaving
her
cousin
still
in
the
hands
of
Mrs.
Marsham
.
   
<EOS>
The
Election
for
the
Chelsea
Districts
.
 
<EOS>
March
came
,
and
still
the
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
held
his
position
.
<EOS>
In
the
early
days
of
March
there
was
given
in
the
House
a
certain
parliamentary
explanation
on
the
subject
,
which
,
however
,
did
not
explain
very
much
to
any
person
.
<EOS>
A
statement
was
made
which
was
declared
by
the
persons
making
it
to
be
altogether
satisfactory
,
but
nobody
else
seemed
to
find
any
satisfaction
in
it
.
<EOS>
The
big
wigs
of
the
Cabinet
had
made
an
arrangement
which
,
from
the
language
used
by
them
on
this
occasion
,
they
must
be
supposed
to
have
regarded
as
hardly
less
permanent
than
the
stars
;
but
everybody
else
protested
that
the
Government
was
going
to
pieces
;
and
Mr.
Bott
was
heard
to
declare
in
clubs
and
lobbies
,
and
wherever
he
could
get
a
semi
-
public
,
political
hearing
,
that
this
kind
of
thing
would
n't
do
.
<EOS>
Lord
Brock
must
either
blow
hot
or
cold
.
<EOS>
If
he
chose
to
lean
upon
Mr.
Palliser
,
he
might
lean
upon
him
,
and
Mr.
Palliser
would
not
be
found
wanting
.
<EOS>
In
such
case
no
opposition
could
touch
Lord
Brock
or
the
Government
.
<EOS>
That
was
Mr.
Bott
's
opinion
.
<EOS>
But
if
Lord
Brock
did
not
so
choose
,
why
,
in
that
case
,
he
must
expect
that
Mr.
Palliser
,
and
Mr.
Palliser
's
friends
,
would
 
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bott
did
not
say
what
they
would
do
;
but
he
was
supposed
by
those
who
understood
the
matter
to
hint
at
an
Opposition
lobby
,
and
adverse
divisions
,
and
to
threaten
Lord
Brock
with
the
open
enmity
of
Mr.
Palliser
,
 
and
of
Mr.
Palliser
's
great
follower
.
  
<EOS>
"
This
kind
of
thing
wo
n't
do
long
,
you
know
,
"
repeated
Mr.
Bott
for
the
second
or
third
time
,
as
he
stood
upon
the
rug
before
the
fire
at
his
club
,
with
one
or
two
of
his
young
friends
around
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
not
,
"
said
Calder
Jones
,
the
hunting
Member
of
Parliament
whom
we
once
met
at
Roebury
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Planty
Pall
wo
n't
stand
it
,
I
should
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
can
he
do
?
"
asked
another
,
an
unfledged
Member
who
was
not
as
yet
quite
settled
as
to
the
leadership
under
which
he
intended
to
work
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
can
he
do
?
"
said
Mr.
Bott
,
who
on
such
an
occasion
as
this
could
be
very
great
,
 
who
,
for
a
moment
,
could
almost
feel
that
he
might
become
a
leader
of
a
party
for
himself
,
and
some
day
institute
a
Bott
Ministry
.
<EOS>
"
What
can
he
do
?
<EOS>
You
will
very
shortly
see
what
he
can
do
.
<EOS>
He
can
make
himself
the
master
of
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
If
Lord
Brock
does
n't
look
about
him
,
he
'll
find
that
Mr.
Palliser
will
be
in
the
Cabinet
without
his
help
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
mean
to
say
that
the
Queen
will
send
for
Planty
Pall
!
"
said
the
young
Member
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
mean
to
say
that
the
Queen
will
send
for
any
one
that
the
House
of
Commons
may
direct
her
to
call
upon
,
"
said
Mr.
Bott
,
who
conceived
himself
to
have
gauged
the
very
depths
of
our
glorious
Constitution
.
<EOS>
"
How
hard
it
is
to
make
any
one
understand
that
the
Queen
has
really
nothing
to
do
with
it
!
"
  
"
Come
,
Bott
,
draw
it
mild
,
"
said
Calder
Jones
,
whose
loyalty
was
shocked
by
the
utter
Manchesterialism
of
his
political
friend
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
if
I
know
it
,
"
said
Mr.
Bott
,
with
something
of
grandeur
in
his
tone
and
countenance
.
<EOS>
"
I
never
drew
it
mild
yet
,
and
I
sha
n't
begin
now
.
<EOS>
All
our
political
offences
against
civilization
have
come
from
men
drawing
it
mild
,
as
you
call
it
.
<EOS>
Why
is
it
that
Englishmen
ca
n't
read
and
write
as
Americans
do
?
<EOS>
Why
ca
n't
they
vote
as
they
do
even
in
Imperial
France
?
<EOS>
Why
are
they
serfs
,
less
free
than
those
whose
chains
were
broken
the
other
day
in
Russia
?
<EOS>
Why
is
the
Spaniard
more
happy
,
and
the
Italian
more
contented
?
<EOS>
Because
men
in
power
have
been
drawing
it
mild
!
"
<EOS>
And
Mr.
Bott
made
an
action
with
his
hand
as
though
he
were
drawing
up
beer
from
a
patent
tap
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
ca
n't
set
aside
Her
Majesty
like
that
,
you
know
,
"
said
the
young
Member
,
who
had
been
presented
,
and
whose
mother
's
old
-
world
notions
about
the
throne
still
clung
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
be
very
sorry
,
"
said
Mr.
Bott
;
"
I
'm
no
republican
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
With
all
his
constitutional
love
,
Mr.
Bott
did
not
know
what
the
word
republican
meant
.
<EOS>
"
I
mean
no
disrespect
to
the
throne
.
<EOS>
The
throne
in
its
place
is
very
well
.
<EOS>
But
the
power
of
governing
this
great
nation
does
not
rest
with
the
throne
.
<EOS>
It
is
contained
within
the
four
walls
of
the
House
of
Commons
.
<EOS>
That
is
the
great
truth
which
all
young
Members
should
learn
,
and
take
to
their
hearts
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
think
Planty
Pall
will
become
Prime
Minister
?
"
said
Calder
Jones
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
n't
said
that
;
but
there
are
more
unlikely
things
.
<EOS>
Among
young
men
I
know
no
man
more
likely
.
<EOS>
But
I
certainly
think
this
,
 
that
if
Lord
Brock
does
n't
take
him
into
the
Cabinet
,
Lord
Brock
wo
n't
long
remain
there
himself
.
"
  
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
the
election
came
on
in
the
Chelsea
districts
,
and
the
whole
of
the
south
-
western
part
of
the
metropolis
was
covered
with
posters
bearing
George
Vavasor
's
name
.
<EOS>
"
Vote
for
Vavasor
and
the
River
Bank
.
<EOS>
"
That
was
the
cry
with
which
he
went
to
the
electors
;
and
though
it
must
be
presumed
that
it
was
understood
by
some
portion
of
the
Chelsea
electors
,
it
was
perfectly
unintelligible
to
the
majority
of
those
who
read
it
.
<EOS>
His
special
acquaintances
and
his
general
enemies
called
him
Viscount
Riverbank
,
and
he
was
pestered
on
all
sides
by
questions
as
to
Father
Thames
.
<EOS>
It
was
Mr.
Scruby
who
invented
the
legend
,
and
who
gave
George
Vavasor
an
infinity
of
trouble
by
the
invention
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
question
in
those
days
as
to
embanking
the
river
from
the
Houses
of
Parliament
up
to
the
remote
desolations
of
further
Pimlico
,
and
Mr.
Scruby
recommended
the
coming
Member
to
pledge
himself
that
he
would
have
the
work
carried
on
even
to
Battersea
Bridge
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
have
a
subject
,
"
pleaded
Mr.
Scruby
.
"
<EOS>
No
young
Member
can
do
anything
without
a
subject
.
<EOS>
And
it
should
be
local
;
 
that
is
to
say
,
if
you
have
anything
of
a
constituency
.
<EOS>
Such
a
subject
as
that
,
if
it
's
well
worked
,
may
save
you
thousands
of
pounds
 
thousands
of
pounds
at
future
elections
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
wo
n't
save
me
anything
at
this
one
,
I
take
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
it
may
secure
the
seat
,
Mr.
Vavasor
,
and
afterwards
make
you
the
most
popular
metropolitan
Member
in
the
House
;
that
is
,
with
your
own
constituency
.
<EOS>
Only
look
at
the
money
that
would
be
spent
in
the
districts
if
that
were
done
!
<EOS>
It
would
come
to
millions
,
sir
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
it
never
will
be
done
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
matters
that
?
"
and
<EOS>
Mr.
Scruby
almost
became
eloquent
as
he
explained
the
nature
of
a
good
parliamentary
subject
.
<EOS>
"
You
should
work
it
up
,
so
as
to
be
able
to
discuss
it
at
all
points
.
<EOS>
Get
the
figures
by
heart
,
and
then
,
as
nobody
else
will
do
so
,
nobody
can
put
you
down
.
<EOS>
Of
course
it
wo
n't
be
done
.
<EOS>
If
it
were
done
,
that
would
be
an
end
of
it
,
and
your
bread
would
be
taken
out
of
your
mouth
.
<EOS>
But
you
can
always
promise
it
at
the
hustings
,
and
can
always
demand
it
in
the
House
.
<EOS>
I
've
known
men
who
've
walked
into
as
much
as
two
thousand
a
year
,
permanent
place
,
on
the
strength
of
a
worse
subject
than
that
!
"
  
<EOS>
Vavasor
allowed
Mr.
Scruby
to
manage
the
matter
for
him
,
and
took
up
the
subject
of
the
River
Bank
.
<EOS>
"
Vavasor
and
the
River
Bank
"
was
carried
about
by
an
army
of
men
with
iron
shoulder
-
straps
,
and
huge
pasteboard
placards
six
feet
high
on
the
top
of
them
.
<EOS>
You
would
think
,
as
you
saw
the
long
rows
,
that
the
men
were
being
marshalled
to
their
several
routes
;
but
they
always
kept
together
 
four
-
and
-
twenty
at
the
heels
of
each
other
.
"
<EOS>
One
placard
at
a
time
would
strike
the
eye
,
"
said
Mr.
Vavasor
,
counting
the
expense
up
to
himself
.
<EOS>
"
There
's
no
doubt
of
it
,
"
said
Mr.
Scruby
in
reply
.
<EOS>
"
One
placard
will
do
that
,
if
it
's
big
enough
;
but
it
takes
four
-
and
-
twenty
to
touch
the
imagination
.
"
<EOS>
And
then
sides
of
houses
were
covered
with
that
shibboleth
 
"
Vavasor
and
the
River
Bank
"
 
<EOS>
the
same
words
repeated
in
columns
down
the
whole
sides
of
houses
.
<EOS>
Vavasor
himself
declared
that
he
was
ashamed
to
walk
among
his
future
constituents
,
so
conspicuous
had
his
name
become
.
<EOS>
Grimes
saw
it
,
and
was
dismayed
.
<EOS>
At
first
,
Grimes
ridiculed
the
cry
with
all
his
publican
's
wit
.
"
<EOS>
Unless
he
mean
to
drown
hisself
in
the
Reach
,
it
's
hard
to
say
what
he
do
mean
by
all
that
gammon
about
the
River
Bank
,
"
said
Grimes
,
as
he
canvassed
for
the
other
Liberal
candidate
.
<EOS>
But
,
after
a
while
,
Grimes
was
driven
to
confess
that
Mr.
Scruby
knew
what
he
was
about
.
"
<EOS>
He
is
a
sharp
"
un
,
that
he
is
,
"
said
Grimes
in
the
inside
bar
of
the
"
Handsome
Man
;
"
and
he
almost
regretted
that
he
had
left
the
leadership
of
Mr.
Scruby
,
although
he
knew
that
on
this
occasion
he
would
not
have
gotten
his
odd
money
.
  
<EOS>
George
Vavasor
,
with
much
labour
,
actually
did
get
up
the
subject
of
the
River
Bank
.
<EOS>
He
got
himself
introduced
to
men
belonging
to
the
Metropolitan
Board
,
and
went
manfully
into
the
matter
of
pounds
,
shillings
,
and
pence
.
<EOS>
He
was
able
even
to
work
himself
into
an
apparent
heat
when
he
was
told
that
the
thing
was
out
of
the
question
;
and
soon
found
that
he
had
disciples
who
really
believed
in
him
.
<EOS>
If
he
could
have
brought
himself
to
believe
in
the
thing
,
 
if
he
could
have
been
induced
himself
to
care
whether
Chelsea
was
to
be
embanked
or
no
,
the
work
would
not
have
been
so
difficult
to
him
.
<EOS>
In
that
case
it
would
have
done
good
to
him
,
if
to
no
one
else
.
<EOS>
But
such
belief
was
beyond
him
.
<EOS>
He
had
gone
too
far
in
life
to
be
capable
of
believing
in
,
or
of
caring
for
,
such
things
.
<EOS>
He
was
ambitious
of
having
a
hand
in
the
government
of
his
country
,
but
he
was
not
capable
of
caring
even
for
that
.
  
<EOS>
But
he
worked
.
<EOS>
He
worked
hard
,
and
spoke
vehemently
,
and
promised
the
men
of
Chelsea
,
Pimlico
,
and
Brompton
that
the
path
of
London
westwards
had
hardly
commenced
as
yet
.
<EOS>
Sloane
Street
should
be
the
new
Cheapside
.
<EOS>
Squares
should
arise
around
the
Chelsea
barracks
,
with
sides
open
to
the
water
,
for
which
Belgravia
would
be
deserted
.
<EOS>
There
should
be
palaces
there
for
the
rich
,
because
the
rich
spend
their
riches
;
but
no
rich
man
's
palace
should
interfere
with
the
poor
man
's
right
to
the
River
Bank
.
<EOS>
Three
millions
and
a
half
should
be
spent
on
the
noble
street
to
be
constructed
,
the
grandest
pathway
that
the
world
should
ever
yet
have
seen
;
three
millions
and
a
half
to
be
drawn
from
,
 
to
be
drawn
from
anywhere
except
from
Chelsea
;
 
from
the
bloated
money
-
bags
of
the
City
Corporation
,
Vavasor
once
ventured
to
declare
,
amidst
the
encouraging
shouts
of
the
men
of
Chelsea
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Scruby
was
forced
to
own
that
his
pupil
worked
the
subject
well
.
"
<EOS>
Upon
my
word
,
that
was
uncommon
good
,
"
he
said
,
almost
patting
Vavasor
on
the
back
,
after
a
speech
in
which
he
had
vehemently
asserted
that
his
ambition
to
represent
the
Chelsea
districts
had
all
come
of
his
long
-
fixed
idea
that
the
glory
of
future
London
would
be
brought
about
by
the
embankment
of
the
river
at
Chelsea
.
  
<EOS>
But
armies
of
men
carrying
big
boards
,
and
public
-
houses
open
at
every
corner
,
and
placards
in
which
the
letters
are
three
feet
long
,
cost
money
.
<EOS>
Those
few
modest
hundreds
which
Mr.
Scruby
had
already
received
before
the
work
began
,
had
been
paid
on
the
supposition
that
the
election
would
not
take
place
till
September
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Scruby
made
an
early
request
,
a
very
early
request
,
that
a
further
sum
of
fifteen
hundred
pounds
should
be
placed
in
his
hands
;
and
he
did
this
in
a
tone
which
clearly
signified
that
not
a
man
would
be
sent
about
through
the
streets
,
or
a
poster
put
upon
a
wall
,
till
this
request
had
been
conceded
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Scruby
was
in
possession
of
two
very
distinct
manners
of
address
.
<EOS>
In
his
jovial
moods
,
when
he
was
instigating
his
clients
to
fight
their
battles
well
,
it
might
almost
be
thought
that
he
was
doing
it
really
for
the
love
of
the
thing
;
and
some
clients
,
so
thinking
,
had
believed
for
a
few
hours
that
Scruby
,
in
his
jolly
,
passionate
eagerness
,
would
pour
out
his
own
money
like
dust
,
trusting
implicitly
to
future
days
for
its
return
.
<EOS>
But
such
clients
had
soon
encountered
Mr.
Scruby
's
other
manner
,
and
had
perceived
that
they
were
mistaken
.
  
<EOS>
The
thing
had
come
so
suddenly
upon
George
Vavasor
that
there
was
not
time
for
him
to
carry
on
his
further
operations
through
his
sister
.
<EOS>
Had
he
written
to
Kate
,
 
<EOS>
let
him
have
written
in
<EOS>
what
language
he
would
,
 
she
would
have
first
rejoined
by
a
negative
,
and
there
would
have
been
a
correspondence
before
he
had
induced
her
to
comply
.
<EOS>
He
thought
of
sending
for
her
by
telegram
,
but
even
in
that
there
would
have
been
too
much
delay
.
<EOS>
He
resolved
,
therefore
,
to
make
his
application
to
Alice
himself
,
and
he
wrote
to
her
,
explaining
his
condition
.
<EOS>
The
election
had
come
upon
him
quite
suddenly
,
as
she
knew
,
he
said
.
<EOS>
He
wanted
two
thousand
pounds
instantly
,
and
felt
little
scruple
in
asking
her
for
it
,
as
he
was
aware
that
the
old
Squire
would
be
only
too
glad
to
saddle
the
property
with
a
legacy
to
Alice
for
the
repayment
of
this
money
,
though
he
would
not
have
advanced
a
shilling
himself
for
the
purpose
of
the
election
.
<EOS>
Then
he
said
a
word
or
two
as
to
his
prolonged
absence
from
Queen
Anne
Street
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
been
there
because
he
had
felt
,
from
her
manner
when
they
last
met
,
that
she
would
for
a
while
prefer
to
be
left
free
from
the
unavoidable
excitement
of
such
interviews
.
<EOS>
But
should
he
be
triumphant
in
his
present
contest
,
he
should
go
to
her
to
share
his
triumph
with
her
;
or
,
should
he
fail
,
he
should
go
to
her
to
console
him
in
his
failure
.
  
<EOS>
Within
three
days
he
heard
from
her
,
saying
that
the
money
would
be
at
once
placed
to
his
credit
.
<EOS>
She
sent
him
also
her
candid
good
wishes
for
success
in
his
enterprise
,
but
beyond
this
her
letter
said
nothing
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
word
of
love
,
 
no
word
of
welcome
,
 
no
expression
of
a
desire
to
see
him
.
<EOS>
Vavasor
,
as
he
perceived
all
this
in
the
reading
of
her
note
,
felt
a
triumph
in
the
possession
of
her
money
.
<EOS>
She
was
ill
-
using
him
by
her
coldness
,
and
there
was
comfort
in
revenge
.
<EOS>
"
It
serves
her
right
,
"
he
said
to
himself
.
"
<EOS>
She
should
have
married
me
at
once
when
she
said
she
would
do
so
,
and
then
it
would
have
been
my
own
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
When
Mr.
Tombe
had
communicated
with
John
Grey
on
the
matter
of
this
increased
demand
,
 
this
demand
which
Mr.
Tombe
began
to
regard
as
carrying
a
love
-
affair
rather
too
far
,
 
Grey
had
telegraphed
back
that
Vavasor
's
demand
for
money
,
if
made
through
Mr.
John
Vavasor
,
was
to
be
honoured
to
the
extent
of
five
thousand
pounds
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Tombe
raised
his
eyebrows
,
and
reflected
that
some
men
were
very
foolish
.
<EOS>
But
John
Grey
's
money
matters
were
of
such
a
nature
as
to
make
Mr.
Tombe
know
that
he
must
do
as
he
was
bidden
;
and
the
money
was
paid
to
George
Vavasor
's
account
.
  
<EOS>
He
told
Kate
nothing
of
this
.
<EOS>
Why
should
he
trouble
himself
to
do
so
?
<EOS>
Indeed
,
at
this
time
he
wrote
no
letters
to
his
sister
,
though
she
twice
sent
to
him
,
knowing
what
his
exigencies
would
be
,
and
made
further
tenders
of
her
own
money
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
reply
to
these
offers
without
telling
her
that
money
had
been
forthcoming
from
that
other
quarter
,
and
so
he
left
them
unanswered
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
the
battle
went
on
gloriously
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Travers
,
the
other
Liberal
candidate
,
spent
his
money
freely
,
 
or
else
some
other
person
did
so
on
his
behalf
.
<EOS>
When
Mr.
Scruby
mentioned
this
last
alternative
to
George
Vavasor
,
George
cursed
his
own
luck
in
that
he
had
never
found
such
backers
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
call
a
man
half
a
Member
when
he
's
brought
in
like
that
,
"
said
Mr.
Scruby
,
comforting
him
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
ca
n't
do
what
he
likes
with
his
vote
.
<EOS>
He
ai
n't
independent
.
<EOS>
You
never
hear
of
those
fellows
getting
anything
good
.
<EOS>
Pay
for
the
article
yourself
,
Mr.
Vavasor
,
and
then
it
's
your
own
.
<EOS>
That
's
what
I
always
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Grimes
went
to
work
strenuously
,
almost
fiercely
,
in
the
opposite
interest
,
telling
all
that
he
knew
,
and
perhaps
more
than
he
knew
,
of
Vavasor
's
circumstances
.
<EOS>
He
was
at
work
morning
,
noon
,
and
night
,
not
only
in
his
own
neighbourhood
,
but
among
those
men
on
the
river
bank
of
whom
he
had
spoken
so
much
in
his
interview
with
Vavasor
in
Cecil
Street
.
<EOS>
The
entire
Vavasorian
army
with
its
placards
was
entirely
upset
on
more
than
one
occasion
,
and
was
once
absolutely
driven
ignominiously
into
the
river
mud
.
<EOS>
And
all
this
was
done
under
the
direction
of
Mr.
Grimes
.
<EOS>
Vavasor
himself
was
pelted
with
offal
from
the
sinking
tide
,
so
that
the
very
name
of
the
River
Bank
became
odious
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
man
who
did
not
like
to
have
his
person
touched
,
and
when
they
hustled
him
he
became
angry
.
"
<EOS>
Lord
love
you
,
Mr.
Vavasor
,
"
said
Scruby
,
"
that
's
nothing
!
<EOS>
I
've
had
a
candidate
<EOS>
so
mauled
,
 
<EOS>
it
was
in
the
Hamlets
,
I
think
,
 
that
there
was
n't
a
spot
on
him
that
was
n't
painted
with
rotten
eggs
.
<EOS>
The
smell
was
something
quite
awful
.
<EOS>
But
I
brought
him
in
,
through
it
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
Mr.
Scruby
at
last
did
as
much
for
George
Vavasor
as
he
had
done
for
the
hero
of
the
Hamlets
.
<EOS>
At
the
close
of
the
poll
Vavasor
's
name
stood
at
the
head
by
a
considerable
majority
,
and
Scruby
comforted
him
by
saying
that
Travers
certainly
would
n't
stand
the
expense
of
a
petition
,
as
the
seat
was
to
be
held
only
for
a
few
months
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
've
done
it
very
cheap
,
Mr.
Vavasor
,
"
said
Scruby
,
"
considering
that
the
seat
is
metropolitan
.
<EOS>
I
do
say
that
you
have
done
it
cheap
.
<EOS>
Another
thousand
,
or
twelve
hundred
,
will
cover
everything
 
<EOS>
say
thirteen
,
perhaps
,
at
the
outside
.
<EOS>
And
when
you
shall
have
fought
the
battle
once
again
,
you
'll
have
paid
your
footing
,
and
the
fellows
will
let
you
in
almost
for
nothing
after
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
A
further
sum
of
thirteen
hundred
pounds
was
wanted
at
once
,
and
then
the
whole
thing
was
to
be
repeated
over
again
in
six
months
"
time
!
<EOS>
This
was
not
consolatory
.
<EOS>
But
,
nevertheless
,
there
was
a
triumph
in
the
thing
itself
which
George
Vavasor
was
man
enough
to
enjoy
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
something
to
have
sat
in
the
House
of
Commons
,
though
it
should
only
have
been
for
half
a
session
.
   
<EOS>
George
Vavasor
Takes
His
Seat
.
 
<EOS>
George
Vavasor
's
feeling
of
triumph
was
not
unjustifiable
.
<EOS>
It
is
something
to
have
sat
in
the
House
of
Commons
,
though
it
has
been
but
for
one
session
!
<EOS>
There
is
on
the
left
-
hand
side
of
our
great
national
hall
,
 
on
the
left
-
hand
side
as
one
enters
it
,
and
opposite
to
the
doors
leading
to
the
Law
Courts
,
 
a
pair
of
gilded
lamps
,
with
a
door
between
them
,
near
to
which
a
privileged
old
dame
sells
her
apples
and
her
oranges
solely
,
as
I
presume
,
for
the
accommodation
of
the
Members
of
the
House
and
of
the
great
policeman
who
guards
the
pass
.
<EOS>
Between
those
lamps
is
the
entrance
to
the
House
of
Commons
,
and
none
but
Members
may
go
that
way
!
<EOS>
It
is
the
only
gate
before
which
I
have
ever
stood
filled
with
envy
,
 
sorrowing
to
think
that
my
steps
might
never
pass
under
it
.
<EOS>
There
are
many
portals
forbidden
to
me
,
as
there
are
many
forbidden
to
all
men
;
and
forbidden
fruit
,
they
say
,
is
sweet
;
but
my
lips
have
watered
after
no
other
fruit
but
that
which
grows
so
high
,
within
the
sweep
of
that
great
policeman
's
truncheon
.
  
<EOS>
Ah
,
my
male
friend
and
reader
,
who
earnest
thy
bread
,
perhaps
,
as
a
country
vicar
;
or
sittest
,
may
-
be
,
at
some
weary
desk
in
Somerset
House
;
or
who
,
perhaps
,
rulest
the
yard
behind
the
Cheapside
counter
,
hast
thou
never
stood
there
and
longed
,
 
<EOS>
hast
thou
never
confessed
,
when
standing
there
,
that
Fate
has
been
unkind
to
thee
in
denying
thee
the
one
thing
that
thou
hast
wanted
?
<EOS>
I
have
done
so
;
and
as
my
slow
steps
have
led
me
up
that
more
than
royal
staircase
,
to
those
passages
and
halls
which
require
the
hallowing
breath
of
centuries
to
give
them
the
glory
in
British
eyes
which
they
shall
one
day
possess
,
I
have
told
myself
,
in
anger
and
in
grief
,
that
to
die
and
not
to
have
won
that
right
of
way
,
though
but
for
a
session
,
 
not
to
have
passed
by
the
narrow
entrance
through
those
lamps
,
 
is
to
die
and
not
to
have
done
that
which
it
most
becomes
an
Englishman
to
have
achieved
.
  
<EOS>
There
are
,
doubtless
,
some
who
come
out
by
that
road
,
the
loss
of
whose
society
is
not
to
be
regretted
.
<EOS>
England
does
not
choose
her
six
hundred
and
fifty
-
four
best
men
.
<EOS>
One
comforts
one
's
self
,
sometimes
,
with
remembering
that
.
<EOS>
The
George
Vavasors
,
the
Calder
Joneses
,
and
the
Botts
are
admitted
.
<EOS>
Dishonesty
,
ignorance
,
and
vulgarity
do
not
close
the
gate
of
that
heaven
against
aspirants
;
and
it
is
a
consolation
to
the
ambition
of
the
poor
to
know
that
the
ambition
of
the
rich
can
attain
that
glory
by
the
strength
of
its
riches
alone
.
<EOS>
But
though
England
does
not
send
thither
none
but
her
best
men
,
the
best
of
her
Commoners
do
find
their
way
there
.
<EOS>
It
is
the
highest
and
most
legitimate
pride
of
an
Englishman
to
have
the
letters
M.P.
written
after
his
name
.
<EOS>
No
selection
from
the
alphabet
,
no
doctorship
,
no
fellowship
<EOS>
,
be
it
of
ever
so
learned
or
royal
a
society
,
no
knightship
,
 
not
though
it
be
of
the
Garter
,
 
confers
so
fair
an
honour
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bott
was
right
when
he
declared
that
this
country
is
governed
from
between
the
walls
of
that
House
,
though
the
truth
was
almost
defiled
by
the
lips
which
uttered
it
.
<EOS>
He
might
have
added
that
from
thence
flow
the
waters
of
the
world
's
progress
,
 
the
fullest
fountain
of
advancing
civilization
.
  
<EOS>
George
Vavasor
,
as
he
went
in
by
the
lamps
and
the
apple
-
stall
,
under
the
guardianship
of
Mr.
Bott
,
felt
all
the
pride
of
which
I
have
been
speaking
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
man
quite
capable
of
feeling
such
pride
as
it
should
be
felt
,
 
capable
,
in
certain
dreamy
moments
,
of
looking
at
the
thing
with
pure
and
almost
noble
eyes
;
of
understanding
the
ambition
of
serving
with
truth
so
great
a
nation
as
that
which
fate
had
made
his
own
.
<EOS>
Nature
,
I
think
,
had
so
fashioned
George
Vavasor
,
that
he
might
have
been
a
good
,
and
perhaps
a
great
man
;
whereas
Mr.
Bott
had
been
born
small
.
<EOS>
Vavasor
had
educated
himself
to
badness
with
his
eyes
open
.
<EOS>
He
had
known
what
was
wrong
,
and
had
done
it
,
having
taught
himself
to
think
that
bad
things
were
best
.
<EOS>
But
poor
Mr.
Bott
had
meant
to
do
well
,
and
thought
that
he
had
done
very
well
indeed
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
tuft
-
hunter
and
a
toady
,
but
he
did
not
know
that
he
was
doing
amiss
in
seeking
to
rise
by
tuft
-
hunting
and
toadying
.
<EOS>
He
was
both
mean
and
vain
,
both
a
bully
and
a
coward
,
and
in
politics
<EOS>
,
I
fear
,
quite
unscrupulous
in
spite
of
his
grand
dogmas
;
but
he
believed
that
he
was
progressing
in
public
life
by
the
proper
and
usual
means
,
and
was
troubled
by
no
idea
that
he
did
wrong
.
  
<EOS>
Vavasor
,
in
those
dreamy
moments
of
which
I
have
spoken
,
would
sometimes
feel
tempted
to
cut
his
throat
and
put
an
end
to
himself
,
because
he
knew
that
he
had
taught
himself
amiss
.
<EOS>
Again
he
would
sadly
ask
himself
whether
it
was
yet
too
late
;
always
,
however
,
answering
himself
that
it
was
too
late
.
<EOS>
Even
now
,
at
this
moment
,
as
he
went
in
between
the
lamps
,
and
felt
much
of
the
honest
pride
of
which
I
have
spoken
,
he
told
himself
that
it
was
too
late
.
<EOS>
What
could
he
do
now
,
hampered
by
such
a
debt
as
that
which
he
owed
to
his
cousin
,
and
with
the
knowledge
that
it
must
be
almost
indefinitely
increased
,
unless
he
meant
to
give
up
this
seat
in
Parliament
,
which
had
cost
him
so
dearly
,
almost
before
he
had
begun
to
enjoy
it
?
<EOS>
But
his
courage
was
good
,
and
he
was
able
to
resolve
that
he
would
go
on
with
the
business
that
he
had
in
hand
,
and
play
out
his
game
to
the
end
.
<EOS>
He
had
achieved
his
seat
in
the
House
of
Commons
,
and
was
so
far
successful
.
<EOS>
Men
who
had
ever
been
gracious
to
him
were
now
more
gracious
than
ever
,
and
they
who
had
not
hitherto
treated
him
with
courtesy
,
now
began
to
smile
and
to
be
very
civil
.
<EOS>
It
was
,
no
doubt
,
a
great
thing
to
have
the
privilege
of
that
entrance
between
the
lamps
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Bott
had
the
new
Member
now
in
hand
,
not
because
there
had
been
any
old
friendship
between
them
,
but
Mr.
Bott
was
on
the
look
-
out
for
followers
,
and
Vavasor
was
on
the
look
-
out
for
a
party
.
<EOS>
A
man
gets
no
great
thanks
for
attaching
himself
to
existing
power
.
<EOS>
Our
friend
might
have
enrolled
himself
among
the
general
supporters
of
the
Government
without
attracting
much
attention
.
<EOS>
He
would
in
such
case
have
been
at
the
bottom
of
a
long
list
.
<EOS>
But
Mr.
Palliser
was
a
rising
man
,
round
whom
,
almost
without
wish
of
his
own
,
a
party
was
forming
itself
.
<EOS>
If
he
came
into
power
,
 
as
come
he
must
,
according
to
Mr.
Bott
and
many
others
,
 
then
they
who
had
acknowledged
the
new
light
before
its
brightness
had
been
declared
,
might
expect
their
reward
.
  
<EOS>
Vavasor
,
as
he
passed
through
the
lobby
to
the
door
of
the
House
,
leaning
on
Mr.
Bott
's
arm
,
was
very
silent
.
<EOS>
He
had
spoken
but
little
since
they
had
left
their
cab
in
Palace
Yard
,
and
was
not
very
well
pleased
by
the
garrulity
of
his
companion
.
<EOS>
He
was
going
to
sit
among
the
first
men
of
his
nation
,
and
to
take
his
chance
of
making
himself
one
of
them
.
<EOS>
He
believed
in
his
own
ability
;
he
believed
thoroughly
in
his
own
courage
;
but
he
did
not
believe
in
his
own
conduct
.
<EOS>
He
feared
that
he
had
done
,
 
feared
still
more
strongly
that
he
would
be
driven
to
do
,
 
that
which
would
shut
men
's
ears
against
his
words
,
and
would
banish
him
from
high
places
.
<EOS>
No
man
believes
in
himself
who
knows
himself
to
be
a
rascal
,
however
great
may
be
his
talent
,
or
however
high
his
pluck
.
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
you
have
heard
a
debate
?
"
said
Mr.
Bott
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
answered
Vavasor
,
who
wished
to
remain
silent
.
  
<EOS>
"
Many
,
probably
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
have
heard
debates
from
the
gallery
.
<EOS>
Now
you
'll
hear
them
from
the
body
of
the
House
,
and
you
'll
find
how
very
different
it
is
.
<EOS>
There
's
no
man
can
know
what
Parliament
is
who
has
never
had
a
seat
.
<EOS>
Indeed
no
one
can
thoroughly
understand
the
British
Constitution
without
it
.
<EOS>
I
felt
,
very
early
in
life
,
that
that
should
be
my
line
;
and
though
it
's
hard
work
and
no
pay
,
I
mean
to
stick
to
it
.
<EOS>
How
do
,
Thompson
?
<EOS>
You
know
Vavasor
?
<EOS>
He
's
just
returned
for
the
Chelsea
Districts
,
and
I
'm
taking
him
up
.
<EOS>
We
sha
n't
divide
to
-
night
;
shall
we
?
<EOS>
Look
!
<EOS>
there
's
<EOS>
Farringcourt
just
coming
out
;
he
's
listened
to
better
than
any
man
in
the
House
now
,
but
he
'll
borrow
half
-
a
-
crown
from
you
if
you
'll
lend
him
one
.
<EOS>
How
d'ye
do
,
my
lord
?
<EOS>
I
hope
I
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
well
?
"
<EOS>
and
Bott
bowed
low
to
a
lord
who
was
hurrying
through
the
lobby
as
fast
as
his
shuffling
feet
would
carry
him
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Of
course
you
know
him
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Vavasor
,
however
,
did
not
know
the
lord
in
question
,
and
was
obliged
to
say
so
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
thought
you
were
up
to
all
these
things
?
"
said
Bott
.
  
<EOS>
"
Taking
the
peerage
generally
,
I
am
not
up
to
it
,
"
said
Vavasor
,
with
a
curl
on
his
lip
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
ought
to
have
known
him
.
<EOS>
That
was
Viscount
Middlesex
;
he
has
got
something
on
to
-
night
about
the
Irish
Church
.
<EOS>
His
father
is
past
ninety
,
and
he
's
over
sixty
.
<EOS>
We
'll
go
in
now
;
but
let
me
give
you
one
bit
of
advice
,
my
dear
fellow
 
do
n't
think
of
speaking
this
session
.
<EOS>
A
Member
can
do
no
good
at
that
work
till
he
has
learned
something
of
the
forms
of
the
House
.
<EOS>
The
forms
of
the
House
are
everything
;
upon
my
word
they
are
.
<EOS>
This
is
Mr.
Vavasor
,
the
new
Member
for
the
Chelsea
Districts
.
"
  
<EOS>
Our
friend
was
thus
introduced
to
the
doorkeeper
,
who
smiled
familiarly
,
and
seemed
to
wink
his
eye
.
<EOS>
Then
George
Vavasor
passed
through
into
the
House
itself
,
under
the
wing
of
Mr.
Bott
.
  
<EOS>
Vavasor
,
as
he
walked
up
the
House
to
the
Clerk
's
table
and
took
the
oath
and
then
walked
down
again
,
felt
himself
to
be
almost
taken
aback
by
the
little
notice
which
was
accorded
to
him
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
that
he
had
expected
to
create
a
sensation
,
or
that
he
had
for
a
moment
thought
on
the
subject
,
but
the
thing
which
he
was
doing
was
so
great
to
him
,
that
the
total
indifference
of
those
around
him
was
a
surprise
to
him
.
<EOS>
After
he
had
taken
his
seat
,
a
few
men
came
up
by
degrees
and
shook
hands
with
him
;
but
it
seemed
,
as
they
did
so
,
merely
because
they
were
passing
that
way
.
<EOS>
He
was
anxious
not
to
sit
next
to
Mr.
Bott
,
but
he
found
himself
unable
to
avoid
this
contiguity
.
<EOS>
That
gentleman
stuck
to
him
pertinaciously
,
giving
him
directions
which
,
at
the
spur
of
the
moment
,
he
hardly
knew
how
not
to
obey
.
<EOS>
So
he
found
himself
sitting
behind
Mr.
Palliser
,
a
little
to
the
right
,
while
Mr.
Bott
occupied
the
ear
of
the
rising
man
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
debate
in
progress
,
but
it
seemed
to
Vavasor
,
as
soon
as
he
was
able
to
become
critical
,
to
be
but
a
dull
affair
,
and
yet
the
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
was
on
his
legs
,
and
Mr.
Palliser
was
watching
him
as
a
cat
watches
a
mouse
.
<EOS>
The
speaker
was
full
of
figures
,
as
becomes
a
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
;
and
as
every
new
budget
of
them
fell
from
him
,
Mr.
Bott
,
with
audible
whispers
,
poured
into
the
ear
of
his
chief
certain
calculations
of
his
own
,
most
of
which
went
to
prove
that
the
financier
in
office
was
altogether
wrong
.
<EOS>
Vavasor
thought
that
he
could
see
that
Mr.
Palliser
was
receiving
more
of
his
assistance
than
was
palatable
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
would
listen
,
if
he
did
listen
,
without
making
any
sign
that
he
heard
,
and
would
occasionally
shake
his
head
with
symptoms
of
impatience
.
<EOS>
But
Mr.
Bott
was
a
man
not
to
be
repressed
by
a
trifle
.
<EOS>
When
Mr.
Palliser
shook
his
head
he
became
more
assiduous
than
ever
,
and
when
Mr.
Palliser
slightly
moved
himself
to
the
left
,
he
boldly
followed
him
.
  
<EOS>
No
general
debate
arose
on
the
subject
which
the
Minister
had
in
hand
,
and
when
he
sat
down
,
Mr.
Palliser
would
not
get
up
,
though
Mr.
Bott
counselled
him
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
The
matter
was
over
for
the
night
,
and
the
time
had
arrived
for
Lord
Middlesex
.
<EOS>
That
nobleman
got
upon
his
feet
,
with
a
roll
of
papers
in
his
hand
,
and
was
proceeding
to
address
the
House
on
certain
matters
of
church
reform
,
with
great
energy
;
but
,
alas
,
for
him
and
for
his
feelings
!
<EOS>
before
his
energy
had
got
itself
into
full
swing
,
the
Members
were
swarming
away
through
the
doors
like
a
flock
of
sheep
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
got
up
and
went
,
and
was
followed
at
once
by
Mr.
Bott
,
who
succeeded
in
getting
hold
of
his
arm
in
the
lobby
.
<EOS>
Had
not
Mr.
Palliser
been
an
even
-
tempered
,
calculating
man
,
with
a
mind
and
spirit
well
under
his
command
,
he
must
have
learned
to
hate
Mr.
Bott
before
this
time
.
<EOS>
Away
streamed
the
Members
,
but
still
the
noble
lord
went
on
speaking
,
struggling
hard
to
keep
up
his
fire
as
though
no
such
exodus
were
in
process
.
<EOS>
There
was
but
little
to
console
him
.
<EOS>
He
knew
that
the
papers
would
not
report
one
sentence
in
twenty
of
those
he
uttered
.
<EOS>
He
knew
that
no
one
would
listen
to
him
willingly
.
<EOS>
He
knew
that
he
had
worked
for
weeks
and
months
to
get
up
his
facts
,
and
he
was
beginning
to
know
that
he
had
worked
in
vain
.
<EOS>
As
he
summoned
courage
to
look
round
,
he
began
to
fear
that
some
enemy
would
count
the
House
,
and
that
all
would
be
over
.
<EOS>
He
had
given
heart
and
soul
to
this
affair
.
<EOS>
His
cry
was
not
as
Vavasor
's
cry
about
the
River
Bank
.
<EOS>
He
believed
in
his
own
subject
with
a
great
faith
,
thinking
that
he
could
make
men
happier
and
better
,
and
bring
them
nearer
to
their
God
.
<EOS>
I
said
that
he
had
worked
for
weeks
and
months
.
<EOS>
I
might
have
said
that
he
had
been
all
his
life
at
this
work
.
<EOS>
Though
he
shuffled
with
his
feet
when
he
walked
,
and
knocked
his
words
together
when
he
talked
,
he
was
an
earnest
man
,
meaning
to
do
well
,
seeking
no
other
reward
for
his
work
than
the
appreciation
of
those
whom
he
desired
to
serve
.
<EOS>
But
this
was
never
to
be
his
.
<EOS>
For
him
there
was
in
store
nothing
but
disappointment
.
<EOS>
And
yet
he
will
work
on
to
the
end
,
either
in
this
House
or
in
the
other
,
labouring
wearily
,
without
visible
wages
of
any
kind
,
and
,
one
may
say
,
very
sadly
.
<EOS>
But
when
he
has
been
taken
to
his
long
rest
,
men
will
acknowledge
that
he
has
done
something
,
and
there
will
be
left
on
the
minds
of
those
who
shall
remember
him
a
conviction
that
he
served
a
good
cause
diligently
,
and
not
altogether
inefficiently
.
<EOS>
Invisible
are
his
wages
,
yet
in
some
coin
are
they
paid
.
<EOS>
Invisible
is
the
thing
he
does
,
and
yet
it
is
done
.
<EOS>
Let
us
hope
that
some
sense
of
this
tardy
appreciation
may
soothe
his
spirit
beyond
the
grave
.
<EOS>
On
the
present
occasion
there
was
nothing
to
soothe
his
spirit
.
<EOS>
The
Speaker
sat
,
urbane
and
courteous
,
with
his
eyes
turned
towards
the
unfortunate
orator
;
but
no
other
ears
in
the
House
seemed
to
listen
to
him
.
<EOS>
The
corps
of
reporters
had
dwindled
down
to
two
,
and
they
used
their
pens
very
listlessly
,
taking
down
here
a
sentence
and
there
a
sentence
,
knowing
that
their
work
was
naught
.
<EOS>
Vavasor
sat
it
out
to
the
last
,
as
it
taught
him
a
lesson
in
those
forms
of
the
House
which
Mr.
Bott
had
truly
told
him
it
would
be
well
that
he
should
learn
.
<EOS>
And
at
last
he
did
learn
the
form
of
a
"
count
-
out
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Some
one
from
a
back
seat
muttered
something
,
which
the
Speaker
understood
;
and
that
high
officer
,
having
had
his
attention
called
to
a
fact
of
which
he
would
never
have
taken
cognizance
without
such
calling
,
did
count
the
House
,
and
finding
that
it
contained
but
<EOS>
twenty
-
three
Members
,
he
put
an
end
to
his
own
labours
and
to
those
of
poor
Lord
Middlesex
.
<EOS>
With
what
feelings
that
noble
lord
must
have
taken
himself
home
,
and
sat
himself
down
in
his
study
,
vainly
opening
a
book
before
his
eyes
,
can
we
not
all
imagine
?
<EOS>
A
man
he
was
with
ample
means
,
with
children
who
would
do
honour
to
his
name
;
one
whose
wife
believed
in
him
,
if
no
one
else
would
do
so
;
a
man
,
let
us
say
,
with
a
clear
conscience
,
to
whom
all
good
things
had
been
given
.
<EOS>
But
of
whom
now
was
he
thinking
with
envy
?
<EOS>
Early
on
that
same
day
Farringcourt
had
spoken
in
the
House
,
 
a
man
to
whom
no
one
would
lend
a
shilling
,
whom
the
privilege
of
that
House
kept
out
of
gaol
,
whose
word
no
man
believed
;
who
was
wifeless
,
childless
,
and
unloved
.
<EOS>
But
three
hundred
men
had
hung
listening
upon
his
words
.
<EOS>
When
he
laughed
in
his
speech
,
they
laughed
;
when
he
was
indignant
against
the
Minister
,
they
sat
breathless
,
as
the
Spaniard
sits
in
the
critical
moment
of
the
bull
-
killing
.
<EOS>
Whichever
way
he
turned
himself
,
he
carried
them
with
him
.
<EOS>
Crowds
of
Members
flocked
into
the
House
from
libraries
and
smoking
-
rooms
when
it
was
known
that
this
ne'er
-
do
-
well
was
on
his
legs
.
<EOS>
The
Strangers
"
Gallery
was
filled
to
overflowing
.
<EOS>
The
reporters
turned
their
rapid
pages
,
working
their
fingers
wearily
till
the
sweat
drops
stood
upon
their
brows
.
<EOS>
And
as
the
Premier
was
attacked
with
some
special
impetus
of
redoubled
irony
,
men
declared
that
he
would
be
driven
to
enrol
the
speaker
among
his
colleagues
,
in
spite
of
dishonoured
bills
and
evil
reports
.
<EOS>
A
man
who
could
shake
the
thunderbolts
like
that
must
be
paid
to
shake
them
on
the
right
side
.
<EOS>
It
was
of
this
man
,
and
of
his
success
,
that
Lord
Middlesex
was
envious
,
as
he
sat
,
wretched
and
respectable
,
in
his
solitary
study
!
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Bott
had
left
the
House
with
Mr.
Palliser
;
and
Vavasor
,
after
the
count
-
out
,
was
able
to
walk
home
by
himself
,
and
think
of
the
position
which
he
had
achieved
.
<EOS>
He
told
himself
over
and
over
again
that
he
had
done
a
great
thing
in
obtaining
that
which
he
now
possessed
,
and
he
endeavoured
to
teach
himself
that
the
price
he
was
paying
for
it
was
not
too
dear
.
<EOS>
But
already
there
had
come
upon
him
something
of
that
feeling
,
 
that
terribly
human
feeling
,
 
which
deprives
every
prize
that
is
gained
of
half
its
value
.
<EOS>
The
mere
having
it
robs
the
diamond
of
its
purity
,
and
mixes
vile
alloy
with
the
gold
.
<EOS>
Lord
Middlesex
,
as
he
had
floundered
on
into
terrible
disaster
,
had
not
been
a
subject
to
envy
.
<EOS>
There
had
been
nothing
of
brilliance
in
the
debate
,
and
the
Members
had
loomed
no
larger
than
ordinary
men
at
ordinary
clubs
.
<EOS>
The
very
doorkeepers
had
hardly
treated
them
with
respect
.
<EOS>
The
great
men
with
whose
names
the
papers
are
filled
had
sat
silent
,
gloomy
,
and
apparently
idle
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
a
fair
opportunity
was
given
them
they
escaped
out
of
the
House
,
as
boys
might
escape
from
school
.
<EOS>
Everybody
had
rejoiced
in
the
break
-
up
of
the
evening
,
except
that
one
poor
old
lord
who
had
worked
so
hard
.
<EOS>
Vavasor
had
spent
everything
that
he
had
to
become
a
Member
of
that
House
,
and
now
,
as
he
went
alone
to
his
lodgings
,
he
could
not
but
ask
himself
whether
the
thing
purchased
was
worth
the
purchase
-
money
.
  
<EOS>
But
his
courage
was
still
high
.
<EOS>
Though
he
was
gloomy
,
and
almost
sad
,
he
knew
that
he
could
trust
himself
to
fight
out
the
battle
to
the
last
.
<EOS>
On
the
morrow
he
would
go
to
Queen
Anne
Street
,
and
would
demand
sympathy
there
from
her
who
had
professed
to
sympathize
with
him
so
strongly
in
his
political
desires
.
<EOS>
With
her
,
at
any
rate
,
the
glory
of
his
Membership
would
not
be
dimmed
by
any
untoward
knowledge
of
the
realities
.
<EOS>
She
had
only
seen
the
play
acted
from
the
boxes
;
and
to
her
eyes
the
dresses
would
still
be
of
silk
velvet
,
and
the
swords
of
bright
steel
.
   
<EOS>
A
Love
Gift
.
 
<EOS>
When
Alice
heard
of
her
cousin
's
success
,
and
understood
that
he
was
actually
Member
of
Parliament
for
the
Chelsea
Districts
,
she
resolved
that
she
would
be
triumphant
.
<EOS>
She
had
sacrificed
nearly
everything
to
her
desire
for
his
success
in
public
life
,
and
now
that
he
had
achieved
the
first
great
step
towards
that
success
,
it
would
have
been
madness
on
her
part
to
decline
her
share
in
the
ovation
.
<EOS>
If
she
could
not
rejoice
in
that
,
what
source
of
joy
would
then
be
left
for
her
?
<EOS>
She
had
promised
to
be
his
wife
,
and
at
present
she
was
under
the
bonds
of
that
promise
.
<EOS>
She
had
so
promised
because
she
had
desired
to
identify
her
interests
with
his
,
 
because
she
wished
to
share
his
risks
,
to
assist
his
struggles
,
and
to
aid
him
in
his
public
career
.
<EOS>
She
had
done
all
this
,
and
he
had
been
successful
.
<EOS>
She
strove
,
therefore
,
to
be
triumphant
on
his
behalf
,
but
she
knew
that
she
was
striving
ineffectually
.
<EOS>
She
had
made
a
mistake
,
and
the
days
were
coming
in
which
she
would
have
to
own
to
herself
that
she
had
done
so
in
sackcloth
,
and
to
repent
with
ashes
.
  
<EOS>
But
yet
she
struggled
to
be
triumphant
.
<EOS>
The
tidings
were
first
brought
to
her
by
her
servant
,
and
then
she
at
once
sat
down
to
write
him
a
word
or
two
of
congratulation
.
<EOS>
But
she
found
the
task
more
difficult
than
she
had
expected
,
and
she
gave
it
up
.
<EOS>
She
had
written
no
word
to
him
since
the
day
on
which
he
had
left
her
almost
in
anger
,
and
now
she
did
not
know
how
she
was
to
address
him
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
wait
till
he
comes
,
"
she
said
,
putting
away
from
her
the
paper
and
pens
.
<EOS>
"
It
will
be
easier
to
speak
than
to
write
.
"
<EOS>
But
she
wrote
to
Kate
,
and
contrived
to
put
some
note
of
triumph
into
her
letter
.
<EOS>
Kate
had
written
to
her
at
length
,
filling
her
sheet
with
a
loud
pæan
of
sincere
rejoicing
.
<EOS>
To
Kate
,
down
in
Westmoreland
,
it
had
seemed
that
her
brother
had
already
done
everything
.
<EOS>
He
had
already
tied
Fortune
to
his
chariot
wheels
.
<EOS>
He
had
made
the
great
leap
,
and
had
overcome
the
only
obstacle
that
Fate
had
placed
in
his
way
.
<EOS>
In
her
great
joy
she
almost
forgot
whence
had
come
the
money
with
which
the
contest
had
been
won
.
<EOS>
She
was
not
enthusiastic
in
many
things
;
 
about
herself
she
was
never
so
;
but
now
she
was
elated
with
an
enthusiasm
which
seemed
to
know
no
bounds
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
proud
,
"
she
said
,
in
her
letter
to
Alice
.
"
<EOS>
No
other
thing
that
he
could
have
done
would
have
made
me
so
proud
of
him
.
<EOS>
Had
the
Queen
sent
for
him
and
made
him
an
earl
,
it
would
have
been
as
nothing
to
this
.
<EOS>
When
I
think
that
he
has
forced
his
way
into
Parliament
without
any
great
friend
,
with
nothing
to
back
him
but
his
own
wit
"
 
<EOS>
she
had
,
in
truth
,
forgotten
Alice
's
money
as
she
wrote
;
 
"
that
he
has
achieved
his
triumph
in
the
metropolis
,
among
the
most
wealthy
and
most
fastidious
of
the
richest
city
in
the
world
,
I
do
feel
proud
of
my
brother
.
<EOS>
And
,
Alice
,
I
hope
that
you
are
proud
of
your
lover
.
"
<EOS>
Poor
girl
!
<EOS>
One
can
not
but
like
her
pride
,
nay
,
almost
love
her
for
it
,
though
it
was
so
sorely
misplaced
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
remembered
that
she
had
known
nothing
of
Messrs.
Grimes
and
Scruby
,
and
the
River
Bank
,
and
that
the
means
had
been
wanting
to
her
of
learning
the
principles
upon
which
some
metropolitan
elections
are
conducted
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
,
Alice
,
I
hope
that
you
are
proud
of
your
lover
!
"
<EOS>
"
He
is
not
my
lover
,
"
Alice
said
to
herself
.
"
<EOS>
He
knows
that
he
is
not
.
<EOS>
He
understands
it
,
though
she
may
not
.
"
<EOS>
And
if
not
your
lover
,
Alice
Vavasor
,
what
is
he
then
to
you
?
<EOS>
And
what
are
you
to
him
,
if
not
his
love
?
<EOS>
She
was
beginning
to
understand
that
she
had
put
herself
in
the
way
of
utter
destruction
;
 
that
she
had
walked
to
the
brink
of
a
precipice
,
and
that
she
must
now
topple
over
it
.
"
<EOS>
He
is
not
my
lover
,
"
she
said
;
and
then
she
sat
silent
and
moody
,
and
it
took
her
hours
to
get
her
answer
written
to
Kate
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
same
afternoon
she
saw
her
father
for
a
moment
or
two
.
"
<EOS>
So
George
has
got
himself
returned
,
"
he
said
,
raising
his
eyebrows
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
he
has
been
successful
.
<EOS>
I
'm
sure
you
must
be
glad
,
papa
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
word
,
I
'm
not
.
<EOS>
He
has
bought
a
seat
for
three
months
;
and
with
whose
money
has
he
purchased
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
n't
let
us
always
speak
of
money
,
papa
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
When
you
discuss
the
value
of
a
thing
just
purchased
,
you
must
mention
the
price
before
you
know
whether
the
purchaser
has
done
well
or
badly
.
<EOS>
They
have
let
him
in
for
his
money
because
there
are
only
a
few
months
left
before
the
general
election
.
<EOS>
Two
thousand
pounds
he
has
had
<EOS>
,
I
believe
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
if
as
much
more
is
wanted
for
the
next
election
he
shall
have
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
well
,
my
dear
;
 
very
well
,
If
you
choose
to
make
a
beggar
of
yourself
,
I
can
not
help
it
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
I
shall
not
complain
though
he
should
spend
all
your
money
,
if
you
do
not
marry
him
at
last
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
In
answer
to
this
,
Alice
said
nothing
.
<EOS>
On
that
point
her
father
's
wishes
were
fast
growing
to
be
identical
with
her
own
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
fairly
what
are
my
feelings
and
my
wishes
,
"
he
continued
.
<EOS>
"
Nothing
,
in
my
opinion
,
would
be
so
deplorable
and
ruinous
as
such
a
marriage
.
<EOS>
You
tell
me
that
you
have
made
up
your
mind
to
take
him
,
and
I
know
well
that
nothing
that
I
can
say
will
turn
you
.
<EOS>
But
I
believe
that
when
he
has
spent
all
your
money
he
will
not
take
you
,
and
that
thus
you
will
be
saved
.
<EOS>
Thinking
as
I
do
about
him
,
you
can
hardly
expect
that
I
should
triumph
because
he
has
got
himself
into
Parliament
with
your
money
!
"
  
<EOS>
Then
he
left
her
,
and
it
seemed
to
Alice
that
he
had
been
very
cruel
.
<EOS>
There
had
been
little
,
she
thought
,
nay
,
nothing
of
a
father
's
loving
tenderness
in
his
words
to
her
.
<EOS>
If
he
had
spoken
to
her
differently
,
might
she
not
even
now
have
confessed
everything
to
him
?
<EOS>
But
herein
Alice
accused
him
wrongfully
.
<EOS>
Tenderness
from
him
on
this
subject
had
,
we
may
say
,
become
impossible
.
<EOS>
She
had
made
it
impossible
.
<EOS>
Nor
could
he
tell
her
the
extent
of
his
wishes
without
damaging
his
own
cause
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
let
her
know
that
all
that
was
done
was
so
done
with
the
view
of
driving
her
into
John
Grey
's
arms
.
  
<EOS>
But
what
words
were
those
for
a
father
to
speak
to
a
daughter
!
<EOS>
Had
she
brought
herself
to
such
a
state
that
her
own
father
desired
to
see
her
deserted
and
thrown
aside
?
<EOS>
And
was
it
probable
that
this
wish
of
his
should
come
to
pass
?
<EOS>
As
to
that
,
Alice
had
already
made
up
her
mind
.
<EOS>
She
thought
that
she
had
made
up
her
mind
that
she
would
never
become
her
cousin
's
wife
.
<EOS>
It
needed
not
her
father
's
wish
to
accomplish
her
salvation
,
if
her
salvation
lay
in
being
separated
from
him
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
next
morning
George
went
to
her
.
<EOS>
The
reader
will
,
perhaps
,
remember
their
last
interview
.
<EOS>
He
had
come
to
her
after
her
letter
to
him
from
Westmoreland
,
and
had
asked
her
to
seal
their
reconciliation
with
a
kiss
;
but
she
had
refused
him
.
<EOS>
He
had
offered
to
embrace
her
,
and
she
had
shuddered
before
him
,
fearing
his
touch
,
telling
him
by
signs
much
more
clear
than
any
words
,
that
she
felt
for
him
none
of
the
love
of
a
woman
.
<EOS>
Then
he
had
turned
from
her
in
anger
,
declaring
to
her
honestly
that
he
was
angry
.
<EOS>
Since
that
he
had
borrowed
her
money
,
 
had
made
two
separate
assaults
upon
her
purse
,
 
and
was
now
come
to
tell
her
of
the
results
.
<EOS>
How
was
he
to
address
her
?
<EOS>
I
beg
that
it
may
be
also
remembered
that
he
was
not
a
man
to
forget
the
treatment
he
had
received
.
<EOS>
When
he
entered
the
room
,
Alice
looked
at
him
,
at
first
,
almost
furtively
.
<EOS>
She
was
afraid
of
him
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
confessed
that
she
already
feared
him
.
<EOS>
Had
there
been
in
the
man
anything
of
lofty
principle
he
might
still
have
made
her
his
slave
,
though
I
doubt
whether
he
could
ever
again
have
forced
her
to
love
him
.
<EOS>
She
looked
at
him
furtively
,
and
perceived
that
the
gash
on
his
face
was
nearly
closed
.
<EOS>
The
mark
of
existing
anger
was
not
there
.
<EOS>
He
had
come
to
her
intending
to
be
gentle
,
if
it
might
be
possible
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
careful
in
his
dress
,
as
though
he
wished
to
try
once
again
if
the
rôle
of
lover
might
be
within
his
reach
.
  
<EOS>
Alice
was
the
first
to
speak
.
"
<EOS>
George
,
I
am
so
glad
that
you
have
succeeded
!
<EOS>
I
wish
you
joy
with
my
whole
heart
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thanks
,
dearest
.
<EOS>
But
before
I
say
another
word
,
let
me
acknowledge
my
debt
.
<EOS>
Unless
you
had
aided
me
with
your
money
,
I
could
not
have
succeeded
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
George
!
<EOS>
pray
do
n't
speak
of
that
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Let
me
rather
speak
of
it
at
once
,
and
have
done
.
<EOS>
If
you
will
think
of
it
,
you
will
know
that
I
must
speak
of
it
sooner
or
later
.
"
<EOS>
He
smiled
and
looked
pleasant
,
as
he
used
to
do
in
those
Swiss
days
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
then
,
speak
and
have
done
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
have
trusted
me
in
thus
giving
me
the
command
of
your
fortune
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
believe
that
you
have
.
<EOS>
I
need
hardly
say
that
I
could
not
have
stood
for
this
last
election
without
it
;
and
I
must
try
to
make
you
understand
that
if
I
had
not
come
forward
at
this
vacancy
,
I
should
have
stood
no
chance
for
the
next
;
otherwise
,
I
should
not
have
been
justified
in
paying
so
dearly
for
a
seat
for
one
session
.
<EOS>
You
can
understand
that
;
eh
,
Alice
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
I
think
so
?
  
<EOS>
"
Anybody
,
even
your
father
,
would
tell
you
that
;
though
,
probably
,
he
regards
my
ambition
to
be
a
Member
of
Parliament
as
a
sign
of
downright
madness
.
<EOS>
But
I
was
obliged
to
stand
now
,
if
I
intended
to
go
on
with
it
,
as
that
old
lord
died
so
inopportunely
.
<EOS>
Well
,
about
the
money
!
<EOS>
It
is
quite
upon
the
cards
that
I
may
be
forced
to
ask
for
another
loan
when
the
autumn
comes
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
shall
have
it
,
George
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thanks
,
Alice
.
<EOS>
And
now
I
will
tell
you
what
I
propose
.
<EOS>
You
know
that
I
have
been
reconciled
,
 
with
a
sort
of
reconciliation
,
 
to
my
grandfather
?
<EOS>
Well
,
when
the
next
affair
is
over
,
I
propose
to
tell
him
exactly
how
you
and
I
then
stand
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
not
go
into
that
now
,
George
.
<EOS>
It
is
enough
for
you
at
present
to
be
assured
that
such
assistance
as
I
can
give
you
is
at
your
command
.
<EOS>
I
want
you
to
feel
the
full
joy
of
your
success
,
and
you
will
do
so
more
thoroughly
if
you
will
banish
all
these
money
troubles
from
your
mind
for
a
while
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
shall
,
at
any
rate
,
be
banished
while
I
am
with
you
,
"
said
he
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
There
;
let
them
go
!
"
<EOS>
And
he
lifted
up
his
right
hand
,
and
blew
at
the
tips
of
his
fingers
.
<EOS>
"
Let
them
vanish
,
"
said
he
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
always
well
to
be
rid
of
such
troubles
for
a
time
.
"
  
<EOS>
It
is
well
to
be
rid
of
them
at
any
time
,
or
at
all
times
,
if
only
they
can
be
banished
without
danger
.
<EOS>
But
when
a
man
has
overused
his
liver
till
it
will
not
act
for
him
any
longer
,
it
is
not
well
for
him
to
resolve
that
he
will
forget
the
weakness
of
his
organ
just
as
he
sits
down
to
dinner
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
pretty
bit
of
acting
,
that
of
Vavasor
's
,
when
he
blew
away
his
cares
;
and
,
upon
the
whole
,
I
do
not
know
that
he
could
have
done
better
.
<EOS>
But
Alice
saw
through
it
,
and
he
knew
that
she
did
so
.
<EOS>
The
whole
thing
was
uncomfortable
to
him
,
except
the
fact
that
he
had
the
promise
of
her
further
moneys
.
<EOS>
But
he
did
not
intend
to
rest
satisfied
with
this
.
<EOS>
He
must
extract
from
her
some
meed
of
approbation
,
some
show
of
sympathy
,
some
spark
of
affection
,
true
or
pretended
,
in
order
that
he
might
at
least
affect
to
be
satisfied
,
and
be
enabled
to
speak
of
the
future
without
open
embarrassment
.
<EOS>
How
could
even
he
take
her
money
from
her
,
unless
he
might
presume
that
he
stood
with
her
upon
some
ground
that
belonged
mutually
to
them
both
?
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
already
taken
my
seat
,
"
said
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
I
saw
that
in
the
newspapers
.
<EOS>
My
acquaintance
among
Members
of
Parliament
is
very
small
,
but
I
see
that
you
were
introduced
,
as
they
call
it
,
by
one
of
the
few
men
that
I
do
know
.
<EOS>
Is
Mr.
Bott
a
friend
of
yours
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
 
certainly
not
a
friend
.
<EOS>
I
may
probably
have
to
act
with
him
in
public
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
that
's
just
what
they
said
of
Mr.
Palliser
when
they
felt
ashamed
of
his
having
such
a
man
as
his
guest
.
<EOS>
I
think
if
I
were
in
public
life
I
should
try
to
act
with
people
that
I
could
like
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
you
dislike
Mr.
Bott
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
like
him
,
but
my
feelings
about
him
are
not
violent
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
a
vulgar
ass
,
"
said
George
,
"
with
no
more
pretensions
to
rank
himself
a
gentleman
than
your
footman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
If
I
had
one
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
he
will
get
on
in
Parliament
,
to
a
certain
extent
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
afraid
I
do
n't
quite
understand
what
are
the
requisites
for
Parliamentary
success
,
or
indeed
of
what
it
consists
.
<EOS>
Is
his
ambition
,
do
you
suppose
,
the
same
as
yours
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
His
ambition
,
I
take
it
,
does
not
go
beyond
a
desire
to
be
Parliamentary
flunkey
to
a
big
man
,
 
with
wages
,
if
possible
,
but
without
,
if
the
wages
are
impossible
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
yours
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
as
to
mine
;
 
there
are
some
things
,
Alice
,
that
a
man
does
not
tell
to
any
one
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Are
there
?
<EOS>
They
must
be
very
terrible
things
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
schoolboy
,
when
he
sits
down
to
make
his
rhymes
,
dares
not
say
,
even
to
his
sister
,
that
he
hopes
to
rival
Milton
;
but
he
nurses
such
a
hope
.
<EOS>
The
preacher
,
when
he
preaches
his
sermon
,
does
not
whisper
,
even
to
his
wife
,
his
belief
that
thousands
may
perhaps
be
turned
to
repentance
by
the
strength
of
his
words
;
but
he
thinks
that
the
thousand
converts
are
possible
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
you
,
though
you
will
not
say
so
,
intend
to
rival
Chatham
,
and
to
make
your
thousand
converts
in
politics
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
like
to
hear
you
laugh
at
me
,
 
I
do
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
It
does
me
good
to
hear
your
voice
again
with
some
touch
of
satire
in
it
.
<EOS>
It
brings
back
the
old
days
,
 
the
days
to
which
I
hope
we
may
soon
revert
without
pain
.
<EOS>
Shall
it
not
be
so
,
dearest
?
"
  
<EOS>
Her
playful
manner
at
once
deserted
her
.
<EOS>
Why
had
he
made
this
foolish
attempt
to
be
tender
?
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
,
"
she
said
,
gloomily
.
  
<EOS>
For
a
few
minutes
he
sat
silent
,
fingering
some
article
belonging
to
her
which
was
lying
on
the
table
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
small
steel
paper
-
knife
,
of
which
the
handle
was
cast
and
gilt
;
a
thing
of
no
great
value
,
of
which
the
price
may
have
been
five
shillings
.
<EOS>
He
sat
with
it
,
passing
it
through
his
fingers
,
while
she
went
on
with
her
work
.
  
<EOS>
"
Who
gave
you
this
paper
-
cutter
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
suddenly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Goodness
me
,
why
do
you
ask
?
<EOS>
and
especially
,
why
do
you
ask
in
that
way
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
asked
simply
because
if
it
is
a
present
to
you
from
any
one
,
I
will
take
up
something
else
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
given
me
by
Mr.
Grey
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
let
it
drop
from
his
fingers
on
to
the
table
with
a
noise
,
and
then
pushed
it
from
him
,
so
that
it
fell
on
the
other
side
,
near
to
where
she
sat
.
  
<EOS>
"
George
,
"
she
said
,
as
she
stooped
and
picked
it
up
,
"
your
violence
is
unreasonable
;
pray
do
not
repeat
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
not
mean
it
,
"
he
said
,
"
and
I
beg
your
pardon
.
<EOS>
I
was
simply
unfortunate
in
the
article
I
selected
.
<EOS>
And
who
gave
you
this
?
"
<EOS>
In
saying
which
he
took
up
a
little
ivory
foot
-
rule
that
was
folded
up
so
as
to
bring
it
within
the
compass
of
three
inches
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
so
happens
that
no
one
gave
me
that
;
I
bought
it
at
a
stupid
bazaar
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
this
will
do
.
<EOS>
You
shall
give
it
me
as
a
present
,
on
the
renewal
of
our
love
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
too
poor
a
thing
to
give
,
"
said
she
,
speaking
still
more
gloomily
than
she
had
done
before
.
  
<EOS>
"
By
no
means
;
nothing
is
too
poor
,
if
given
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
Anything
will
do
;
a
ribbon
,
a
glove
,
a
broken
sixpence
.
<EOS>
Will
you
give
me
something
that
I
may
take
,
and
,
taking
it
,
may
know
that
your
heart
is
given
with
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Take
the
rule
,
if
you
please
,
"
she
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
about
the
heart
?
"
he
asked
.
  
<EOS>
He
should
have
been
more
of
a
rascal
or
less
.
<EOS>
Seeing
how
very
much
of
a
rascal
he
was
already
,
I
think
it
would
have
been
better
that
he
should
have
been
more
,
 
that
he
should
have
been
able
to
content
his
spirit
with
the
simple
acquisition
of
her
money
,
and
that
he
should
have
been
free
from
all
those
remains
of
a
finer
feeling
which
made
him
desire
her
love
also
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
not
so
.
<EOS>
It
was
necessary
for
his
comfort
that
she
should
,
at
any
rate
,
say
she
loved
him
.
"
<EOS>
Well
,
Alice
,
and
what
about
the
heart
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
so
much
rather
talk
about
politics
,
George
,
"
said
she
.
  
<EOS>
The
cicatrice
began
to
make
itself
very
visible
in
his
face
,
and
the
debonair
manner
was
fast
vanishing
.
<EOS>
He
had
fixed
his
eyes
upon
her
,
and
had
inserted
his
thumbs
in
the
armholes
of
his
waistcoat
.
  
<EOS>
"
Alice
,
that
is
not
quite
fair
,
"
he
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
mean
to
be
unfair
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
so
sure
of
that
.
<EOS>
I
almost
think
that
you
do
mean
it
.
<EOS>
You
have
told
me
that
you
intend
to
become
my
wife
.
<EOS>
If
,
after
that
,
you
wilfully
make
me
miserable
,
will
not
that
be
unfair
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
making
you
miserable
,
 
certainly
not
wilfully
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
that
letter
which
you
wrote
to
me
from
Westmoreland
mean
anything
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
George
,
do
not
strive
to
make
me
think
that
it
meant
too
much
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
it
did
,
you
had
better
say
so
at
once
.
"
  
<EOS>
But
Alice
,
though
she
would
have
said
so
had
she
dared
,
made
no
answer
to
this
.
<EOS>
She
sat
silent
,
turning
her
face
away
from
his
gaze
,
longing
that
the
meeting
might
be
over
,
and
feeling
that
she
had
lost
her
own
self
-
respect
.
  
<EOS>
"
Look
here
,
Alice
,
"
he
said
,
"
I
find
it
very
hard
to
understand
you
.
<EOS>
When
I
look
back
over
all
that
has
passed
between
us
,
and
to
that
other
episode
in
your
life
,
summing
it
all
up
with
your
conduct
to
me
at
present
,
I
find
myself
at
a
loss
to
read
your
character
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
fear
I
can
not
help
you
in
the
reading
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
When
you
first
loved
me
;
 
for
you
did
love
me
.
<EOS>
I
understood
that
well
enough
.
<EOS>
There
is
no
young
man
who
in
early
life
does
not
read
with
sufficient
clearness
that
sweetest
morsel
of
poetry
.
 
<EOS>
And
when
you
quarrelled
with
me
,
judging
somewhat
harshly
of
my
offences
,
I
understood
that
also
;
for
it
is
the
custom
of
women
to
be
hard
in
their
judgement
on
such
sins
.
<EOS>
When
I
heard
that
you
had
accepted
the
offer
made
to
you
by
that
gentleman
in
Cambridgeshire
,
I
thought
that
I
understood
you
still
,
 
knowing
how
natural
it
was
that
you
should
seek
some
cure
for
your
wound
.
<EOS>
I
understood
it
,
and
accused
myself
,
not
you
,
in
that
I
had
driven
you
to
so
fatal
a
remedy
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Here
Alice
turned
round
towards
him
sharply
,
as
though
she
were
going
to
interrupt
him
,
but
she
said
nothing
,
though
he
paused
for
her
to
speak
;
and
then
he
went
on
.
"
<EOS>
And
I
understood
it
well
when
I
heard
that
this
cure
had
been
too
much
for
you
.
<EOS>
By
heavens
,
yes
!
<EOS>
there
was
no
misunderstanding
that
.
<EOS>
I
meant
no
insult
to
the
man
when
I
upset
his
little
toy
just
now
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
a
word
to
say
against
him
.
<EOS>
For
many
women
he
would
make
a
model
husband
,
but
you
are
not
one
of
them
.
<EOS>
And
when
you
discovered
this
yourself
,
as
you
did
,
I
understood
that
without
difficulty
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
by
heavens
!
<EOS>
if
ever
woman
had
been
driven
to
a
mistake
,
you
had
been
driven
to
one
there
.
<EOS>
"
Here
she
looked
at
him
again
,
and
met
his
eyes
.
<EOS>
She
looked
at
him
with
something
of
his
own
fierceness
in
her
face
,
as
though
she
were
preparing
herself
to
fight
with
him
;
but
she
said
nothing
at
the
moment
,
and
then
he
again
went
on
.
"
<EOS>
And
,
Alice
,
I
understood
it
also
when
you
again
consented
to
be
my
wife
.
<EOS>
I
thought
that
I
still
understood
you
then
.
<EOS>
I
may
have
been
vain
to
think
so
,
but
surely
it
was
natural
.
<EOS>
I
believed
that
the
old
love
had
come
back
upon
you
,
and
again
warmed
your
heart
.
<EOS>
I
thought
that
it
had
been
cold
during
our
separation
,
and
I
was
pleased
to
think
so
.
<EOS>
Was
that
unnatural
?
<EOS>
Put
yourself
in
my
place
,
and
say
if
you
would
not
have
thought
so
.
<EOS>
I
told
myself
that
I
understood
you
then
,
and
I
told
myself
that
in
all
that
you
had
done
you
had
acted
as
a
true
,
and
good
,
and
loving
woman
.
<EOS>
I
thought
of
you
much
,
and
I
saw
that
your
conduct
,
as
a
whole
,
was
intelligible
and
becoming
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
last
word
grated
on
Alice
's
ears
,
and
she
showed
her
anger
by
the
motion
of
her
foot
upon
the
floor
.
<EOS>
Her
cousin
noted
it
all
,
but
went
on
as
though
he
had
not
noted
it
.
"
<EOS>
But
now
your
present
behaviour
makes
all
the
rest
a
riddle
.
<EOS>
You
have
said
that
you
would
be
my
wife
,
declaring
thereby
that
you
had
forgiven
my
offences
,
and
,
as
I
suppose
,
reassuring
me
of
your
love
;
and
yet
you
receive
me
with
all
imaginable
coldness
.
<EOS>
What
am
I
to
think
of
it
,
and
in
what
way
would
you
have
me
behave
to
you
?
<EOS>
When
last
I
was
here
I
asked
you
for
a
kiss
.
"
<EOS>
As
he
said
this
he
looked
at
her
with
all
his
eyes
,
with
his
mouth
just
open
,
so
as
to
show
the
edges
of
his
white
teeth
,
with
the
wound
down
his
face
all
wide
and
purple
.
<EOS>
The
last
word
came
with
a
stigmatizing
hiss
from
his
lips
.
<EOS>
Though
she
did
not
essay
to
speak
,
he
paused
again
,
as
if
he
were
desirous
that
she
might
realize
the
full
purport
of
such
a
request
.
<EOS>
I
think
that
,
in
the
energy
of
his
speaking
,
a
touch
of
true
passion
had
come
upon
him
;
that
he
had
forgotten
his
rascaldom
,
and
his
need
of
her
money
,
and
that
he
was
punishing
her
with
his
whole
power
of
his
vengeance
for
the
treatment
which
he
had
received
from
her
.
<EOS>
"
I
asked
you
for
a
kiss
.
<EOS>
If
you
are
to
be
my
wife
you
can
have
no
shame
in
granting
me
such
a
request
.
<EOS>
Within
the
last
two
months
you
have
told
me
that
you
would
marry
me
.
<EOS>
What
am
I
to
think
of
such
a
promise
if
you
deny
me
all
customary
signs
of
your
affection
?
<EOS>
"
Then
he
paused
again
,
and
she
found
that
the
time
had
come
in
which
she
must
say
something
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
you
can
not
understand
,
"
she
said
,
"
that
I
have
suffered
much
.
"
  
"
And
is
that
to
be
my
answer
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
what
answer
you
want
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Come
,
Alice
,
do
not
be
untrue
;
you
do
know
what
answer
I
want
,
and
you
know
also
whether
my
wanting
it
is
unreasonable
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
one
ever
told
me
that
I
was
untrue
before
,
"
she
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
know
what
it
is
that
I
desire
.
<EOS>
I
desire
to
learn
that
the
woman
who
is
to
be
my
wife
,
in
truth
,
loves
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
was
standing
up
,
and
so
was
he
also
,
<EOS>
but
still
she
said
nothing
.
<EOS>
He
had
in
his
hand
the
little
rule
which
she
had
told
him
that
he
might
take
,
but
he
held
it
as
though
in
doubt
what
he
would
do
with
it
.
"
<EOS>
Well
,
Alice
,
am
I
to
hear
anything
from
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
now
,
George
;
you
are
angry
,
and
I
will
not
speak
to
you
in
your
anger
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Have
I
not
cause
to
be
angry
?
<EOS>
Do
you
not
know
that
you
are
treating
me
badly
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
that
my
head
aches
,
and
that
I
am
very
wretched
.
<EOS>
I
wish
you
would
leave
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
,
then
,
is
your
gift
,
"
said
he
,
and
he
threw
the
rule
over
on
to
the
sofa
behind
her
.
"
<EOS>
And
there
is
the
trumpery
trinket
which
I
had
hoped
you
would
have
worn
for
my
sake
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Whereupon
something
which
he
had
taken
from
his
waistcoat
-
pocket
was
thrown
violently
into
the
fender
,
beneath
the
fire
-
grate
.
<EOS>
He
then
walked
with
quick
steps
to
the
door
;
but
when
his
hand
was
on
the
handle
,
he
turned
.
<EOS>
"
Alice
,
"
he
said
,
"
when
I
am
gone
,
try
to
think
honestly
of
your
conduct
to
me
.
"
<EOS>
Then
he
went
,
and
she
remained
still
,
till
she
heard
the
front
door
close
behind
him
.
  
<EOS>
When
she
was
sure
that
he
was
gone
,
her
first
movement
was
made
in
search
of
the
trinket
.
<EOS>
I
fear
that
this
was
not
dignified
on
her
part
;
but
I
think
that
it
was
natural
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
that
she
had
any
desire
for
the
jewel
,
or
any
curiosity
even
to
see
it
.
<EOS>
She
would
very
much
have
preferred
that
he
should
have
brought
nothing
of
the
kind
to
her
.
<EOS>
But
she
had
a
feminine
reluctance
that
anything
of
value
should
be
destroyed
without
a
purpose
.
<EOS>
So
she
took
the
shovel
,
and
poked
among
the
ashes
,
and
found
the
ring
which
her
cousin
had
thrown
there
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
valuable
ring
,
bearing
a
ruby
on
it
between
two
small
diamonds
.
<EOS>
Such
at
least
,
she
became
aware
,
had
been
its
bearing
;
but
one
of
the
side
stones
had
been
knocked
out
by
the
violence
with
which
the
ring
had
been
flung
.
<EOS>
She
searched
even
for
this
,
scorching
her
face
and
eyes
,
but
in
vain
.
<EOS>
Then
she
made
up
her
mind
that
the
diamond
should
be
lost
for
ever
,
and
that
it
should
go
out
among
the
cinders
into
the
huge
dust
-
heaps
of
the
metropolis
.
<EOS>
Better
that
,
though
it
was
distasteful
to
her
feminine
economy
,
than
the
other
alternative
of
setting
the
servants
to
search
,
and
thereby
telling
them
something
of
what
had
been
done
.
  
<EOS>
When
her
search
was
over
,
she
placed
the
ring
on
the
mantelpiece
;
but
she
knew
that
it
would
not
do
to
leave
it
there
,
 
so
she
folded
it
up
carefully
in
a
new
sheet
of
note
-
paper
,
and
put
it
in
the
drawer
of
her
desk
.
<EOS>
After
that
she
sat
herself
down
at
the
table
to
think
what
she
would
do
;
but
her
head
was
,
in
truth
,
racked
with
pain
,
and
on
that
occasion
she
could
bring
her
thoughts
to
no
conclusion
.
   
<EOS>
Mr.
Cheesacre
's
Disappointment
.
 
<EOS>
When
Mrs.
Greenow
was
left
alone
in
her
lodgings
,
after
the
little
entertainment
which
she
had
given
to
her
two
lovers
,
she
sat
herself
down
to
think
seriously
over
her
affairs
.
<EOS>
There
were
three
paths
open
before
her
.
<EOS>
She
might
take
Mr.
Cheesacre
,
or
she
might
take
Captain
Bellfield
 
<EOS>
or
she
might
decide
that
she
would
have
nothing
more
to
say
to
either
of
them
in
the
way
of
courting
.
<EOS>
They
were
very
persistent
,
no
doubt
;
but
she
thought
that
she
would
know
how
to
make
them
understand
her
,
if
she
should
really
make
up
her
mind
that
she
would
have
neither
one
nor
the
other
.
<EOS>
She
was
going
to
leave
Norwich
after
Easter
,
and
they
knew
that
such
was
her
purpose
.
<EOS>
Something
had
been
said
of
her
returning
to
Yarmouth
in
the
summer
.
<EOS>
She
was
a
just
woman
at
heart
,
and
justice
required
that
each
of
them
should
know
what
was
to
be
his
prospect
if
she
did
so
return
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
good
deal
to
be
said
on
Mr.
Cheesacre
's
behalf
.
<EOS>
Mahogany
-
furnitured
bedrooms
assist
one
's
comfort
in
this
life
;
and
heaps
of
manure
,
though
they
are
not
brilliant
in
romance
,
are
very
efficacious
in
farming
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Greenow
by
no
means
despised
these
things
;
and
as
for
the
owner
of
them
,
though
she
saw
that
there
was
much
amiss
in
his
character
,
she
thought
that
his
little
foibles
were
of
such
a
nature
that
she
,
as
his
wife
,
or
any
other
woman
of
spirit
,
might
be
able
to
repress
them
,
if
not
to
cure
them
.
<EOS>
But
she
had
already
married
for
money
once
,
as
she
told
herself
very
plainly
on
this
occasion
,
and
she
thought
that
she
might
now
venture
on
a
little
love
.
<EOS>
Her
marriage
for
money
had
been
altogether
successful
.
<EOS>
The
nursing
of
old
Greenow
had
not
been
very
disagreeable
to
her
,
nor
had
it
taken
longer
than
she
had
anticipated
.
<EOS>
She
had
now
got
all
the
reward
that
she
had
ever
promised
herself
,
and
she
really
did
feel
grateful
to
his
memory
.
<EOS>
I
almost
think
that
among
those
plentiful
tears
some
few
drops
belonged
to
sincerity
.
<EOS>
She
was
essentially
a
happy
-
tempered
woman
,
blessed
with
a
good
digestion
,
who
looked
back
upon
her
past
life
with
contentment
,
and
forward
to
her
future
life
with
confidence
.
<EOS>
She
would
not
be
greedy
,
she
said
to
herself
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
want
more
money
,
and
therefore
she
would
have
none
of
Mr.
Cheesacre
.
<EOS>
So
far
she
resolved
,
 
resolving
also
that
,
if
possible
,
the
mahogany
-
furnitured
bedrooms
should
be
kept
in
the
family
,
and
made
over
to
her
niece
,
Kate
Vavasor
.
  
<EOS>
But
should
she
marry
for
love
;
and
if
so
,
should
Captain
Bellfield
be
the
man
?
<EOS>
Strange
to
say
,
his
poverty
and
his
scampishness
and
his
lies
almost
recommended
him
to
her
.
<EOS>
At
any
rate
,
it
was
not
of
those
things
that
she
was
afraid
.
<EOS>
She
had
a
woman
's
true
belief
in
her
own
power
,
and
thought
that
she
could
cure
them
,
 
as
far
as
they
needed
cure
.
<EOS>
As
for
his
stories
about
Inkerman
,
and
his
little
debts
,
she
cared
nothing
about
that
.
<EOS>
She
also
had
her
Inkermans
,
and
was
quite
aware
that
she
made
as
good
use
of
them
as
the
Captain
did
of
his
.
<EOS>
And
as
for
the
debts
,
 
what
was
a
man
to
do
who
had
n't
got
any
money
?
<EOS>
She
also
had
owed
for
her
gloves
and
corsets
in
the
ante
-
Greenow
days
of
her
adventures
.
<EOS>
But
there
was
this
danger
,
 
that
there
might
be
more
behind
of
which
she
had
never
heard
.
<EOS>
Another
Mrs.
Bellfield
was
not
impossible
;
and
what
,
if
instead
of
being
a
real
captain
at
all
,
he
should
be
a
returned
ticket
-
of
-
leave
man
!
<EOS>
Such
things
had
happened
.
<EOS>
Her
chief
security
was
in
this
,
 
that
Cheesacre
had
known
the
man
for
many
years
,
and
would
certainly
have
told
anything
against
him
that
he
did
know
.
<EOS>
Under
all
these
circumstances
,
she
could
not
quite
make
up
her
mind
either
for
or
against
Captain
Bellfield
.
  
<EOS>
Between
nine
and
ten
in
the
evening
,
an
hour
or
so
after
Mr.
Cheesacre
had
left
her
,
Jeannette
brought
to
her
some
arrowroot
with
a
little
sherry
in
it
.
<EOS>
She
usually
dined
early
,
and
it
was
her
habit
to
take
a
light
repast
before
she
retired
for
the
night
.
  
<EOS>
"
Jeannette
,
"
she
said
,
as
she
stirred
the
lumps
of
white
sugar
in
the
bowl
,
"
I
'm
afraid
those
two
gentlemen
have
quarrelled
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
laws
,
ma'am
,
in
course
they
have
!
<EOS>
How
was
they
to
help
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
Jeannette
,
on
these
occasions
,
was
in
the
habit
of
standing
beside
the
chair
of
her
mistress
,
and
chatting
with
her
;
and
then
,
if
the
chatting
was
much
prolonged
,
she
would
gradually
sink
down
upon
the
corner
of
a
chair
herself
,
 
and
then
the
two
women
would
be
very
comfortable
together
over
the
fire
<EOS>
,
Jeannette
never
forgetting
that
she
was
the
servant
,
and
Mrs.
Greenow
never
forgetting
that
she
was
the
mistress
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
why
should
they
quarrel
,
Jeannette
?
<EOS>
It
's
very
foolish
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
about
being
foolish
,
ma'am
;
but
it
's
the
most
natural
thing
in
life
.
<EOS>
If
I
had
two
beaux
as
was
a
-
courting
me
together
,
in
course
I
should
expect
as
they
would
punch
each
other
's
heads
.
<EOS>
There
's
some
girls
<EOS>
do
it
a
purpose
,
because
they
like
to
see
it
.
<EOS>
One
at
a
time
's
<EOS>
what
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
You
're
a
young
thing
,
Jeannette
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
ma'am
 
<EOS>
yes
;
I
am
young
,
no
doubt
.
<EOS>
But
I
wo
n't
say
but
<EOS>
what
I
've
had
a
beau
,
young
as
I
look
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
do
n't
suppose
that
I
want
beaux
,
as
you
call
them
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
,
ma'am
,
as
you
wants
"
em
exactly
.
<EOS>
That
's
as
may
be
.
<EOS>
There
they
are
;
and
if
they
was
to
blow
each
other
's
brains
out
in
the
gig
to
-
night
,
I
should
n't
be
a
bit
surprised
for
one
.
<EOS>
There
's
nothing
wo
n't
quiet
them
at
Oileymead
to
-
night
,
if
brandy
-
and
-
water
do
n't
do
it
.
"
<EOS>
As
she
said
this
,
Jeannette
slipt
into
her
chair
,
and
held
up
her
hands
in
token
of
the
intensity
of
her
fears
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
you
silly
child
,
they
're
not
going
home
together
at
all
.
<EOS>
Did
not
the
Captain
go
away
first
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
Captain
did
go
away
first
,
certainly
;
but
I
thought
perhaps
it
was
to
get
his
pistols
and
fighting
things
ready
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
wo
n't
fight
,
Jeannette
.
<EOS>
Gentlemen
have
given
over
fighting
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Have
they
,
ma'am
?
<EOS>
That
makes
it
much
easier
for
ladies
,
no
doubt
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
them
peaceable
ways
will
come
down
to
such
as
us
in
time
.
<EOS>
It
'd
be
a
comfort
,
I
know
,
to
them
as
are
quiet
given
,
like
me
.
<EOS>
I
hate
to
see
men
knocking
each
other
's
heads
about
,
 
I
do
.
<EOS>
So
Mr.
Cheesacre
and
the
Captain
wo
n't
fight
,
ma'am
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
they
wo
n't
,
you
little
fool
,
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
,
dear
;
I
was
so
sure
we
should
have
had
the
papers
all
full
of
it
,
 
and
perhaps
one
of
them
stretched
upon
his
bloody
bier
!
<EOS>
I
wonder
which
it
would
have
been
?
<EOS>
I
always
made
up
my
mind
that
the
Captain
would
n't
be
wounded
in
any
of
his
wital
parts
 
unless
it
was
his
heart
,
you
know
,
ma'am
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
why
should
they
quarrel
at
all
,
Jeannette
?
<EOS>
It
is
the
most
foolish
thing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
ma'am
,
I
do
n't
know
about
that
.
<EOS>
What
else
is
they
to
do
?
<EOS>
There
's
some
things
as
you
can
cry
halves
about
,
but
there
's
no
crying
halves
about
this
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
About
what
,
Jeannette
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
about
you
,
ma'am
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Jeannette
,
I
wonder
how
you
can
say
such
things
;
as
if
I
,
in
my
position
,
had
ever
said
a
word
to
encourage
either
of
them
.
<EOS>
You
know
it
's
not
true
,
Jeannette
,
and
you
should
n't
say
so
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Whereupon
Mrs.
Greenow
put
her
handkerchief
to
her
eyes
,
and
Jeannette
,
probably
in
token
of
contrition
,
put
her
apron
to
hers
.
  
<EOS>
"
To
be
sure
,
ma'am
,
no
lady
could
have
behaved
better
through
it
than
you
have
done
,
and
goodness
knows
you
have
been
tried
hard
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
I
have
,
Jeannette
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
if
gentlemen
will
make
fools
of
themselves
,
it
is
n't
your
fault
;
is
it
,
ma'am
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
'm
so
sorry
that
they
should
have
quarrelled
.
<EOS>
They
were
such
dear
friends
,
you
know
;
 
quite
all
in
all
to
each
other
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
When
you
've
settled
which
it
's
to
be
,
ma'am
,
that
'll
all
come
right
again
,
 
seeing
that
gentlefolks
like
them
have
given
up
fighting
,
as
you
say
.
<EOS>
"
Then
there
was
a
little
pause
.
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
,
ma'am
,
it
wo
n't
be
Mr.
Cheesacre
?
<EOS>
To
be
sure
,
he
's
a
man
as
is
uncommonly
well
to
do
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
's
all
that
to
me
,
Jeannette
?
<EOS>
I
shall
ever
regard
Mr.
Cheesacre
as
a
dear
friend
who
has
been
very
good
to
me
at
a
time
of
trouble
;
but
he
'll
never
be
more
than
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
it
'll
be
the
Captain
,
ma'am
?
<EOS>
I
'm
sure
,
for
my
part
,
I
've
always
thought
the
Captain
was
the
nicer
gentleman
of
the
two
,
 
and
have
always
said
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
's
nothing
to
me
,
girl
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
as
for
money
,
 
what
's
the
good
of
having
more
than
enough
?
<EOS>
If
he
can
bring
love
,
you
can
bring
money
;
ca
n't
you
,
ma'am
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
's
nothing
to
me
,
girl
,
"
repeated
Mrs.
Greenow
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
he
will
be
?
"
said
Jeannette
,
plainly
asking
a
question
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
'm
sure
!
<EOS>
What
's
the
world
come
to
<EOS>
,
I
wonder
,
when
you
sit
yourself
down
there
,
and
cross
-
examine
your
mistress
in
that
way
!
<EOS>
Get
to
bed
,
will
you
?
<EOS>
It
's
near
ten
o'clock
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
I
have
n't
said
anything
amiss
,
ma'am
;
"
and
Jeannette
rose
from
her
seat
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
my
fault
for
encouraging
you
,
"
said
Mrs.
Greenow
.
<EOS>
"
Go
down
-
stairs
and
finish
your
work
,
do
;
and
then
take
yourself
off
to
bed
.
<EOS>
Next
week
we
shall
have
to
be
packing
up
,
and
there
'll
be
all
my
things
to
see
to
before
that
.
"
<EOS>
So
Jeannette
got
up
and
departed
,
and
after
some
few
further
thoughts
about
Captain
Bellfield
,
Mrs.
Greenow
herself
went
to
her
bedroom
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Cheesacre
,
when
he
drove
back
to
Oileymead
alone
from
Norwich
,
after
dining
with
Mrs.
Greenow
,
had
kept
himself
hot
,
and
almost
comfortable
,
with
passion
against
Bellfield
;
and
his
heat
,
if
not
his
comfort
,
had
been
sustained
by
his
seeing
the
Captain
,
with
his
portmanteau
,
escaping
just
as
he
reached
his
own
homestead
.
<EOS>
But
early
on
the
following
morning
his
mind
reverted
to
Mrs.
Greenow
,
and
he
remembered
,
with
anything
but
satisfaction
,
some
of
the
hard
things
which
she
had
said
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
had
made
mistakes
in
his
manner
of
wooing
.
<EOS>
He
was
quite
aware
of
that
now
,
and
was
determined
that
they
should
be
rectified
for
the
future
.
<EOS>
She
had
rebuked
him
for
having
said
nothing
about
his
love
.
<EOS>
He
would
instantly
mend
that
fault
.
<EOS>
And
she
had
bidden
him
not
to
be
so
communicative
about
his
wealth
.
<EOS>
Henceforth
he
would
be
dumb
on
that
subject
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
he
could
not
but
think
that
the
knowledge
of
his
circumstances
which
the
lady
already
possessed
,
must
be
of
service
to
him
.
<EOS>
"
She
ca
n't
really
like
a
poor
beggarly
wretch
who
has
n't
got
a
shilling
,
"
he
said
to
himself
.
<EOS>
He
was
very
far
from
feeling
that
the
battle
was
already
lost
.
<EOS>
Her
last
word
to
him
had
been
an
assurance
of
her
friendship
;
and
then
why
should
she
have
been
at
so
much
trouble
to
tell
him
the
way
in
which
he
ought
to
address
her
if
she
were
herself
indifferent
as
to
his
addresses
?
<EOS>
He
was
,
no
doubt
,
becoming
tired
of
his
courtship
,
and
heartily
wished
that
the
work
were
over
;
but
he
was
not
minded
to
give
it
up
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
prepared
himself
for
another
attack
,
and
took
himself
into
Norwich
without
seeking
counsel
from
any
one
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
trust
himself
to
think
that
she
could
really
wish
to
refuse
him
after
all
the
encouragement
she
had
given
him
.
<EOS>
On
this
occasion
he
put
on
no
pink
shirt
or
shiny
boots
,
being
deterred
from
doing
so
by
a
remembrance
of
Captain
Bellfield
's
ridicule
;
but
,
nevertheless
,
he
dressed
himself
with
considerable
care
.
<EOS>
He
clothed
his
nether
person
in
knickerbockers
,
with
tight
,
leathern
,
bright
-
coloured
gaiters
round
his
legs
,
being
conscious
of
certain
manly
graces
and
symmetrical
proportions
which
might
,
as
he
thought
,
stand
him
in
good
stead
.
<EOS>
And
he
put
on
a
new
shooting
-
coat
,
the
buttons
on
which
were
elaborate
,
and
a
wonderful
waistcoat
worked
over
with
foxes
"
heads
.
<EOS>
He
completed
his
toilet
with
a
round
,
low
-
crowned
hat
,
with
dog's
-
skin
gloves
,
and
a
cutting
whip
.
<EOS>
Thus
armed
he
went
forth
resolved
to
conquer
or
to
die
,
 
as
far
as
death
might
result
from
any
wound
which
Mrs.
Greenow
might
be
able
to
give
him
.
<EOS>
He
waited
,
on
this
occasion
,
for
the
coming
of
no
market
-
day
;
indeed
,
the
journey
into
the
city
was
altogether
special
,
and
he
was
desirous
that
she
should
know
that
such
was
the
case
.
<EOS>
He
drove
at
a
great
pace
into
the
inn
-
yard
,
threw
his
reins
to
the
ostler
,
took
just
one
glass
of
cherry
-
brandy
at
the
bar
,
and
then
marched
off
across
the
market
-
place
to
the
Close
,
with
quiet
and
decisive
steps
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
that
you
,
Cheesacre
?
"
said
a
friendly
voice
,
in
one
of
the
narrow
streets
.
<EOS>
"
Who
expected
to
see
you
in
Norwich
on
a
Thursday
!
<EOS>
"
It
was
Grimsby
,
the
son
of
old
Grimsby
of
Hatherwich
,
a
country
gentleman
,
and
one
,
therefore
,
to
whom
Cheesacre
would
generally
pay
much
respect
;
but
on
this
occasion
he
did
not
even
pull
up
for
an
instant
,
or
moderate
his
pace
.
"
<EOS>
A
little
bit
of
private
business
,
"
he
said
,
and
marched
onwards
with
his
head
towards
the
Close
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
not
going
to
be
afraid
of
a
woman
 
<EOS>
not
if
I
know
it
,
"
he
said
to
himself
;
but
,
nevertheless
,
at
a
certain
pastrycook
's
,
of
whose
shop
he
had
knowledge
,
he
pulled
up
and
had
another
glass
of
cherry
-
brandy
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Greenow
is
at
home
,
"
he
said
to
Jeannette
,
not
deigning
to
ask
any
question
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
yes
,
sir
;
she
is
at
home
,
"
said
Jeannette
,
conscious
that
some
occasion
had
arrived
;
and
in
another
second
he
was
in
the
presence
of
his
angel
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Cheesacre
,
whoever
expected
to
see
you
in
Norwich
on
a
Thursday
?
"
said
the
lady
,
as
she
welcomed
him
,
using
almost
the
same
words
as
his
friend
had
done
in
the
street
.
<EOS>
Why
should
not
he
come
into
Norwich
on
a
Thursday
,
as
well
as
any
one
else
?
<EOS>
Did
they
suppose
that
he
was
tied
for
ever
to
his
ploughs
and
carts
?
<EOS>
He
was
minded
to
conduct
himself
with
a
little
spirit
on
this
occasion
,
and
to
improve
the
opinion
which
Mrs.
Greenow
had
formed
about
him
.
<EOS>
On
this
account
he
answered
her
somewhat
boldly
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
no
knowing
when
I
may
be
in
Norwich
,
Mrs.
Greenow
,
or
when
I
may
n't
.
<EOS>
I
'm
one
of
those
men
of
whom
nobody
knows
anything
certain
,
except
that
I
pay
as
I
go
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Then
he
remembered
that
he
was
not
to
make
any
more
boasts
about
his
money
,
and
he
endeavoured
to
cover
the
error
.
<EOS>
"
There
's
one
other
thing
they
may
all
know
if
they
please
,
but
we
wo
n't
say
what
that
is
just
at
present
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Wo
n't
you
sit
down
,
Mr.
Cheesacre
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
 
thank
you
,
 
I
will
sit
down
for
a
few
minutes
if
you
'll
let
me
,
Mrs.
Greenow
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Greenow
,
I
'm
in
such
a
state
of
mind
that
I
must
put
an
end
to
it
,
or
else
I
shall
be
going
mad
,
and
doing
somebody
a
damage
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
!
<EOS>
what
has
happened
to
you
?
<EOS>
You
're
going
out
shooting
,
presently
;
are
you
not
?
"
<EOS>
and
Mrs.
Greenow
looked
down
at
his
garments
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
Mrs.
Greenow
,
I
'm
not
going
out
shooting
.
<EOS>
I
put
on
these
things
because
I
thought
I
might
take
a
shot
as
I
came
along
.
<EOS>
But
I
could
n't
bring
myself
to
do
it
,
and
then
I
would
n't
take
them
off
again
.
<EOS>
What
does
it
matter
what
a
man
wears
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Not
in
the
least
,
so
long
as
he
is
decent
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
sure
I
'm
always
that
,
Mrs.
Greenow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
dear
,
yes
.
<EOS>
More
than
that
,
I
should
say
.
<EOS>
I
consider
you
to
be
rather
gay
in
your
attire
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
pretend
to
anything
of
that
kind
,
Mrs.
Greenow
.
<EOS>
I
like
to
be
nice
,
and
all
that
kind
of
thing
.
<EOS>
There
are
people
who
think
that
because
a
man
farms
his
own
land
,
he
must
be
always
in
the
muck
.
<EOS>
It
is
the
case
,
of
course
,
with
those
who
have
to
make
their
rent
and
living
out
of
it
.
"
<EOS>
Then
he
remembered
that
he
was
again
treading
on
forbidden
ground
,
and
stopped
himself
.
"
<EOS>
But
it
do
n't
matter
what
a
man
wears
if
his
heart
is
n't
easy
within
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
why
you
should
speak
in
that
way
,
Mr.
Cheesacre
;
but
it
's
what
I
have
felt
every
hour
since
 
since
Greenow
left
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Cheesacre
was
rather
at
a
loss
to
know
how
he
should
begin
.
<EOS>
This
allusion
to
the
departed
one
did
not
at
all
assist
him
.
<EOS>
He
had
so
often
told
the
widow
that
care
killed
a
cat
,
and
that
a
live
dog
was
better
than
a
dead
lion
;
and
had
found
so
little
efficacy
in
the
proverbs
,
that
he
did
not
care
to
revert
to
them
.
<EOS>
He
was
aware
that
some
more
decided
method
of
proceeding
was
now
required
.
<EOS>
Little
hints
at
love
-
making
had
been
all
very
well
in
the
earlier
days
of
their
acquaintance
;
but
there
must
be
something
more
than
little
hints
before
he
could
hope
to
bring
the
matter
to
a
favourable
conclusion
.
<EOS>
The
widow
herself
had
told
him
that
he
ought
to
talk
about
love
;
and
he
had
taken
two
glasses
of
cherry
-
brandy
,
hoping
that
they
might
enable
him
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
He
had
put
on
a
coat
with
brilliant
buttons
,
and
new
knickerbockers
,
in
order
that
he
might
be
master
of
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
He
was
resolved
to
call
a
spade
a
spade
,
and
to
speak
boldly
of
his
passion
;
but
how
was
he
to
begin
?
<EOS>
There
was
the
difficulty
.
<EOS>
He
was
now
seated
in
a
chair
,
and
there
he
remained
silent
for
a
minute
or
two
,
while
she
smoothed
her
eyebrows
with
her
handkerchief
after
her
last
slight
ebullition
of
grief
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Greenow
,
"
he
exclaimed
at
last
,
jumping
up
before
her
;
"
dearest
Mrs.
Greenow
;
darling
Mrs.
Greenow
,
will
you
be
my
wife
?
<EOS>
There
!
<EOS>
I
have
said
it
at
last
,
and
I
mean
it
.
<EOS>
Everything
that
I
've
got
shall
be
yours
.
<EOS>
Of
course
I
speak
specially
of
my
hand
and
heart
.
<EOS>
As
for
love
;
 
oh
,
Arabella
,
if
you
only
knew
me
!
<EOS>
I
do
n't
think
there
's
a
man
in
Norfolk
better
able
to
love
a
woman
than
I
am
.
<EOS>
Ever
since
I
first
saw
you
at
Yarmouth
,
I
've
been
in
love
to
that
extent
that
I
've
not
known
what
I
've
been
about
.
<EOS>
If
you
'll
ask
them
at
home
,
they
'll
tell
you
that
I
've
not
been
able
to
look
after
anything
about
the
place
,
 
not
as
it
should
be
done
.
<EOS>
I
have
n't
really
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
suppose
I
've
opened
the
wages
book
half
a
dozen
times
since
last
July
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
has
that
been
my
fault
,
Mr.
Cheesacre
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
word
it
has
.
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
move
about
anywhere
without
thinking
about
you
.
<EOS>
My
mind
's
made
up
;
I
wo
n't
stay
at
Oileymead
unless
you
will
come
and
be
its
mistress
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
stay
at
Oileymead
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
I
'll
let
the
place
,
and
go
and
travel
somewheres
.
<EOS>
What
's
the
use
of
my
hanging
on
there
without
the
woman
of
my
heart
?
<EOS>
I
could
n't
do
it
,
Mrs.
Greenow
;
I
could
n't
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
Of
course
I
've
got
everything
there
that
money
can
buy
,
 
<EOS>
but
it
's
all
of
no
use
to
a
man
that
's
in
love
.
<EOS>
Do
you
know
,
I
've
come
quite
to
despise
money
and
stock
,
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
.
<EOS>
I
have
n't
had
my
banker
's
book
home
these
last
three
months
.
<EOS>
Only
think
of
that
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
how
can
I
help
you
,
Mr.
Cheesacre
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Just
say
one
word
,
and
the
thing'll
be
done
.
<EOS>
Say
you
'll
be
my
wife
?
<EOS>
I
'll
be
so
good
to
you
.
<EOS>
I
will
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
As
for
your
fortune
,
I
do
n't
care
that
for
it
!
<EOS>
I
'm
not
like
somebody
else
;
it
's
yourself
<EOS>
I
want
.
<EOS>
You
shall
be
my
pet
,
and
my
poppet
,
and
my
dearest
little
duck
all
the
days
of
your
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
Mr.
Cheesacre
;
it
can
not
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
why
not
?
<EOS>
Look
here
,
Arabella
!
"
<EOS>
At
these
words
he
rose
from
his
chair
,
and
coming
immediately
before
her
,
went
down
on
both
knees
so
close
to
her
as
to
prevent
the
possibility
of
her
escaping
from
him
.
<EOS>
There
could
be
no
doubt
as
to
the
efficacy
of
the
cherry
-
brandy
.
<EOS>
There
he
was
,
well
down
on
his
knees
;
but
he
had
not
got
down
so
low
without
some
little
cracking
and
straining
on
the
part
of
the
gaiters
with
which
his
legs
were
encompassed
.
<EOS>
He
,
in
his
passion
,
had
probably
omitted
to
notice
this
;
but
Mrs.
Greenow
,
who
was
more
cool
in
her
present
temperament
,
was
painfully
aware
that
he
might
not
be
able
to
rise
with
ease
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Cheesacre
,
do
n't
make
a
fool
of
yourself
.
<EOS>
Get
up
,
"
said
she
.
  
<EOS>
"
Never
,
till
you
have
told
me
that
you
will
be
mine
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
you
'll
remain
there
for
ever
,
which
will
be
inconvenient
.
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
have
you
take
hold
of
my
hand
,
Mr.
Cheesacre
.
<EOS>
I
tell
you
to
have
done
.
"
<EOS>
Whereupon
his
grasp
upon
her
hand
was
released
;
but
he
made
no
attempt
to
rise
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
saw
a
man
look
so
much
like
a
fool
in
my
life
,
"
said
she
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
do
n't
get
up
,
I
'll
push
you
over
.
<EOS>
There
;
do
n't
you
hear
?
<EOS>
There
's
somebody
coming
.
"
  
<EOS>
But
Cheesacre
,
whose
senses
were
less
acute
than
the
lady
's
,
did
not
hear
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
never
get
up
,
"
said
he
,
"
till
you
have
bid
me
hope
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Bid
you
play
the
fiddle
.
<EOS>
Get
away
from
my
knees
,
at
any
rate
.
<EOS>
There
;
 
he
'll
be
in
the
room
now
before
 
"
  
Cheesacre
now
did
hear
a
sound
of
steps
,
and
the
door
was
opened
while
he
made
his
first
futile
attempt
to
get
back
to
a
standing
position
.
<EOS>
The
door
was
opened
,
and
Captain
Bellfield
entered
.
<EOS>
"
I
beg
ten
thousand
pardons
,
"
said
he
,
"
<EOS>
but
as
I
did
not
see
Jeannette
,
I
ventured
to
come
in
.
<EOS>
May
I
venture
to
congratulate
my
friend
Cheesacre
on
his
success
?
"
  
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
Cheesacre
had
risen
;
but
he
had
done
so
slowly
,
and
with
evident
difficulty
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
trouble
you
to
leave
the
room
,
Captain
Bellfield
,
"
said
he
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
particularly
engaged
with
Mrs.
Greenow
,
as
any
gentleman
might
have
seen
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
was
n't
the
slightest
difficulty
in
seeing
it
,
old
fellow
,
"
said
the
Captain
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Shall
I
wish
you
joy
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
trouble
you
to
leave
the
room
,
sir
,
"
said
Cheesacre
,
walking
up
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Certainly
,
if
Mrs.
Greenow
will
desire
me
to
do
so
,
"
said
the
Captain
.
  
<EOS>
Then
Mrs.
Greenow
felt
herself
called
upon
to
speak
.
  
<EOS>
"
Gentlemen
,
I
must
beg
that
you
will
not
make
my
drawing
-
room
a
place
for
quarrelling
.
<EOS>
Captain
Bellfield
,
lest
there
should
be
any
misconception
,
I
must
beg
you
to
understand
that
the
position
in
which
you
found
Mr.
Cheesacre
was
one
altogether
of
his
own
seeking
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
with
my
consent
that
he
was
there
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
easily
believe
that
,
Mrs.
Greenow
,
"
said
the
Captain
.
  
<EOS>
"
Who
cares
what
you
believe
,
sir
?
"
said
Mr.
Cheesacre
.
  
<EOS>
"
Gentlemen
!
<EOS>
gentlemen
!
<EOS>
this
is
really
unkind
.
<EOS>
Captain
Bellfield
,
I
think
I
had
better
ask
you
to
withdraw
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
By
all
means
,
"
said
Mr.
Cheesacre
.
  
<EOS>
"
As
it
is
absolutely
necessary
that
I
should
give
Mr.
Cheesacre
a
definite
answer
after
what
has
occurred
 
"
  
"
Of
course
,
"
said
Captain
Bellfield
,
preparing
to
go
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
take
another
opportunity
of
paying
my
respects
to
you
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
I
might
be
allowed
to
come
this
evening
?
"
  
<EOS>
To
this
Mrs.
Greenow
half
assented
with
an
uncertain
nod
,
and
then
the
Captain
went
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
the
door
was
closed
behind
his
back
,
Mr.
Cheesacre
again
prepared
to
throw
himself
into
his
former
position
,
but
to
this
Mrs.
Greenow
decidedly
objected
.
<EOS>
If
he
were
allowed
to
go
down
again
,
there
was
no
knowing
what
force
might
be
necessary
to
raise
him
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Cheesacre
,
"
she
said
,
"
let
there
be
an
end
to
this
little
farce
between
us
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Farce
!
"
said
he
,
standing
with
his
hand
on
his
heart
,
and
his
legs
and
knickerbockers
well
displayed
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
certainly
either
a
farce
or
a
mistake
.
<EOS>
If
the
latter
,
 
and
<EOS>
I
have
been
at
all
to
blame
,
 
<EOS>
I
ask
your
pardon
most
sincerely
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
'll
be
Mrs.
Cheesacre
;
wo
n't
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
Mr.
Cheesacre
;
no
.
<EOS>
One
husband
is
enough
for
any
woman
,
and
mine
lies
buried
at
Birmingham
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
damn
it
!
"
said
he
,
in
utter
disgust
at
this
further
reference
to
Mr.
Greenow
.
<EOS>
The
expression
,
at
such
a
moment
,
militated
against
courtesy
;
but
even
Mrs.
Greenow
herself
felt
that
the
poor
man
had
been
subjected
to
provocation
.
  
<EOS>
"
Let
us
part
friends
,
"
said
she
,
offering
him
her
hand
.
  
<EOS>
But
he
turned
his
back
upon
her
,
for
there
was
something
in
his
eye
that
he
wanted
to
hide
.
<EOS>
I
believe
that
he
really
did
love
her
,
and
that
at
this
moment
he
would
have
taken
her
,
even
though
he
had
learned
that
her
fortune
was
gone
.
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
not
give
me
your
hand
,
"
said
she
,
"
in
token
that
there
is
no
anger
between
us
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
think
about
it
again
 
do
!
"
said
he
.
<EOS>
"
If
there
's
anything
you
like
to
have
changed
,
I
'll
change
it
at
once
.
<EOS>
I
'll
give
up
Oileymead
altogether
,
if
you
do
n't
like
being
so
near
the
farm
-
yard
.
<EOS>
I
'll
give
up
anything
;
so
I
will
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Greenow
,
if
you
only
knew
how
I
've
set
my
heart
upon
it
!
"
<EOS>
And
now
,
though
his
back
was
turned
,
the
whimpering
of
his
voice
told
plainly
that
tears
were
in
his
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
a
little
touched
.
<EOS>
No
woman
would
feel
disposed
to
marry
a
man
simply
because
he
cried
,
and
perhaps
few
women
would
be
less
likely
to
give
way
to
such
tenderness
than
Mrs.
Greenow
.
<EOS>
She
understood
men
and
women
too
well
,
and
had
seen
too
much
both
of
the
world
's
rough
side
and
of
its
smooth
side
to
fall
into
such
a
blunder
as
that
;
but
she
was
touched
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
friend
,
"
she
said
,
putting
her
hand
upon
his
arm
,
"
think
no
more
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
ca
n't
help
thinking
of
it
,
"
said
he
,
almost
blubbering
in
his
earnestness
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
no
,
"
said
she
,
still
touching
him
with
her
hand
.
<EOS>
"
Why
,
Mr.
Cheesacre
,
how
can
you
bring
yourself
to
care
for
an
old
woman
like
me
,
when
so
many
pretty
young
ladies
would
give
their
eyes
to
get
a
kind
word
from
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
want
any
young
lady
,
"
said
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
Charlie
Fairstairs
,
who
would
make
as
good
a
wife
as
any
girl
I
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Psha
!
<EOS>
Charlie
Fairstairs
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
very
idea
of
having
such
a
bride
palmed
off
upon
him
did
something
to
restore
him
to
his
manly
courage
.
  
<EOS>
"
Or
my
niece
,
Kate
Vavasor
,
who
has
a
nice
little
fortune
of
her
own
,
and
who
is
as
accomplished
as
she
is
good
-
looking
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
's
nothing
to
me
,
Mrs.
Greenow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
because
you
never
asked
her
to
be
anything
.
<EOS>
If
I
get
her
to
come
back
to
Yarmouth
next
summer
,
will
you
think
about
it
?
<EOS>
You
want
a
wife
,
and
you
could
n't
do
better
if
you
searched
all
England
over
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
so
pleasant
for
us
to
be
such
near
friends
;
would
n't
it
?
"
<EOS>
And
again
she
put
her
hand
upon
his
arm
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Greenow
,
just
at
present
there
's
only
one
woman

that
's
my

And
that
's
yourself

<EOS>
I
'm
a
broken
-
hearted
man
,
 
<EOS>
I
am
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
I
did
n't
ever
think
I
should
feel
so
much
about
a
thing
of
the
kind
 
<EOS>
I
did
n't
,
really
.
<EOS>
I
hardly
know
what
to
do
with
myself
;
but
I
suppose
I
'd
better
go
back
to
Oileymead
.
"
<EOS>
He
had
become
so
painfully
unconscious
of
his
new
coat
and
his
knickerbockers
that
it
was
impossible
not
to
pity
him
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
always
hate
the
place
now
,
"
he
said
,
 
"
always
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
will
pass
away
.
<EOS>
You
'd
be
as
happy
as
a
king
there
,
if
you
'd
take
Kate
for
your
queen
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
'll
you
do
,
Mrs.
Greenow
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
shall
I
do
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
what
will
you
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
,
if
you
marry
Kate
?
<EOS>
Why
,
I
'll
come
and
stay
with
you
half
my
time
,
and
nurse
the
children
,
as
an
old
grand
-
aunt
should
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
But
about
 
.
<EOS>
"
Then
he
hesitated
,
and
she
asked
him
of
what
he
was
thinking
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
mean
to
take
that
man
Bellfield
,
do
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Come
,
Mr.
Cheesacre
,
that
's
rank
jealousy
.
<EOS>
What
right
can
you
have
to
ask
me
whether
I
shall
take
any
man
or
no
man
?
<EOS>
The
chances
are
that
I
shall
remain
as
I
am
till
I
'm
carried
to
my
grave
;
but
I
'm
not
going
to
give
any
pledge
about
it
to
you
or
to
any
one
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
know
that
man
,
Mrs.
Greenow
;
you
do
n't
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
I
tell
it
you
as
your
friend
.
<EOS>
Does
not
it
stand
to
reason
,
when
he
has
got
nothing
in
the
world
,
that
he
must
be
a
beggar
?
<EOS>
It
's
all
very
well
saying
that
when
a
man
is
courting
a
lady
,
he
should
n't
say
much
about
his
money
;
but
you
wo
n't
make
me
believe
that
any
man
will
make
a
good
husband
who
has
n't
got
a
shilling
.
<EOS>
And
for
lies
,
there
's
no
beating
him

"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
then
,
has
he
been
such
a
friend
of
yours
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
because
I
've
been
foolish
.
<EOS>
I
took
up
with
him
just
because
he
looked
pleasant
,
I
suppose
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
want
to
prevent
me
from
doing
the
same
thing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
were
to
marry
him
,
Mrs.
Greenow
,
it
's
my
belief
<EOS>
I
should
do
him
a
mischief
;
it
is
,
really
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
think
I
could
stand
it
;
 
<EOS>
a

,
skulking
beggar

I

go
now

"
<EOS>
Certainly
,
if
that
's
the
way
you
choose
to
talk
about
my
friends

"
  
<EOS>
"
Friends
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
Well
,
I
wo
n't
say
any
more
at
present
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
if
I
was
to
talk
for
ever
it
would
n't
be
any
good

"
  
<EOS>
"
Come
and
talk
to
Kate
Vavasor
for
ever
,
Mr.
Cheesacre

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
To
this
he
made
no
reply
,
but
went
forth
from
the
house
,
and
got
his
gig
,
and
drove
himself
home
to
Oileymead
,
thinking
of
his
disappointment
with
all
the
bitterness
of
a
young
lover
.
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
ever
think
I
should
ever
care
so
much
about
anything
,
"
he
said
,
as
he
took
himself
up
to
bed
that
night
.
  
<EOS>
That
evening
Captain
Bellfield
did
call
in
the
Close
,
as
he
had
said
he
would
do
,
but
he
was
not
admitted

<EOS>
Preparations
for
Lady
Monk
's
Party
.
 
<EOS>
Early
in
April
,
the
Easter
recess
being
all
over
,
Lady
Monk
gave
a
grand
party
in
London
.
<EOS>
Lady
Monk
's
town
house
was
in
Gloucester
Square
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
large
mansion
,
and
Lady
Monk
's
parties
in
London
were
known
to
be
very
great
affairs
.
<EOS>
She
usually
gave
two
or
three
in
the
season
,
and
spent
a
large
portion
of
her
time
and
energy
in
so
arranging
matters
that
her
parties
should
be
successful
.
<EOS>
As
this
was
her
special
line
in
life
,
a
failure
would
have
been
very
distressing
to
her
;
 
and
we
may
also
say
very
disgraceful
,
taking
into
consideration
,
as
we
should
do
in
forming
our
judgement
on
the
subject
,
the
very
large
sums
of
Sir
Cosmo
's
money
which
she
spent
in
this
way
.
<EOS>
But
she
seldom
did
fail
.
<EOS>
She
knew
how
to
select
her
days
,
so
as
not
to
fall
foul
of
other
events
.
<EOS>
It
seldom
happened
that
people
could
not
come
to
her
because
of
a
division
which
occupied
all
the
Members
of
Parliament
,
or
that
they
were
drawn
away
by
the
superior
magnitude
of
some
other
attraction
in
the
world
of
fashion
.
<EOS>
This
giving
of
parties
was
her
business
,
and
she
had
learned
it
thoroughly
.
<EOS>
She
worked
at
it
harder
than
most
men
work
at
their
trades
,
and
let
us
hope
that
the
profits
were
consolatory
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
generally
acknowledged
to
be
the
proper
thing
to
go
to
Lady
Monk
's
parties
.
<EOS>
There
were
certain
people
who
were
asked
,
and
who
went
as
a
matter
of
course
,
 
people
who
were
by
no
means
on
intimate
terms
with
Lady
Monk
,
or
with
Sir
Cosmo
;
but
they
were
people
to
have
whom
was
the
proper
thing
,
and
they
were
people
who
understood
that
to
go
to
Lady
Monk
's
was
the
proper
thing
for
them
.
<EOS>
The
Duchess
of
St.
Bungay
was
always
there
,
though
she
hated
Lady
Monk
,
and
Lady
Monk
always
abused
her
;
but
a
card
was
sent
to
the
Duchess
in
the
same
way
as
the
Lord
Mayor
invites
a
Cabinet
Minister
to
dinner
,
even
though
the
one
man
might
believe
the
other
to
be
a
thief
.
<EOS>
And
Mrs.
Conway
Sparkes
was
generally
there
;
she
went
everywhere
.
<EOS>
Lady
Monk
did
not
at
all
know
why
Mrs.
Conway
Sparkes
was
so
favoured
by
the
world
;
but
there
was
the
fact
,
and
she
bowed
to
it
.
<EOS>
Then
there
were
another
set
,
the
members
of
which
were
or
were
not
invited
,
according
to
circumstances
,
at
the
time
;
and
these
were
the
people
who
were
probably
the
most
legitimate
recipients
of
Lady
Monk
's
hospitality
.
<EOS>
Old
family
friends
of
her
husband
were
among
the
number
.
<EOS>
Let
the
Tuftons
come
in
April
,
and
perhaps
again
in
May
;
then
they
will
not
feel
their
exclusion
from
that
seventh
heaven
of
glory
,
 
the
great
culminating
crush
in
July
.
<EOS>
Scores
of
young
ladies
who
really
loved
parties
belonged
to
this
set
.
<EOS>
The
mothers
and
aunts
knew
Lady
Monk
's
sisters
and
cousins
.
<EOS>
They
accepted
so
much
of
Lady
Monk
's
good
things
as
she
vouchsafed
them
,
and
were
thankful
.
<EOS>
Then
there
was
another
lot
,
which
generally
became
,
especially
on
that
great
July
occasion
,
the
most
numerous
of
the
three
.
<EOS>
It
comprised
all
those
who
made
strong
interest
to
obtain
admittance
within
her
ladyship
's
house
,
 
who
struggled
and
fought
almost
with
tooth
and
nail
to
get
invitations
.
<EOS>
Against
these
people
Lady
Monk
carried
on
an
internecine
war
.
<EOS>
Had
she
not
done
so
she
would
have
been
swamped
by
them
,
and
her
success
would
have
been
at
an
end
;
but
yet
she
never
dreamed
of
shutting
her
doors
against
them
altogether
,
or
of
saying
boldly
that
none
such
should
hamper
her
staircases
.
<EOS>
She
knew
that
she
must
yield
,
but
her
effort
was
made
to
yield
to
as
few
as
might
be
possible
.
<EOS>
When
she
was
first
told
by
her
factotum
in
these
operations
that
Mr.
Bott
wanted
to
come
,
she
positively
declined
to
have
him
.
<EOS>
When
it
was
afterwards
intimated
to
her
that
the
Duchess
of
St.
Bungay
had
made
a
point
of
it
,
she
sneered
at
the
Duchess
,
and
did
not
even
then
yield
.
<EOS>
But
when
at
last
it
was
brought
home
to
her
understanding
that
Mr.
Palliser
wished
it
,
and
that
Mr.
Palliser
probably
would
not
come
himself
unless
his
wishes
were
gratified
,
she
gave
way
.
<EOS>
She
was
especially
anxious
that
Lady
Glencora
should
come
to
her
gathering
,
and
she
knew
that
Lady
Glencora
could
not
be
had
without
Mr.
Palliser
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
very
much
desired
by
her
that
Lady
Glencora
should
be
there
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Burgo
,
"
said
she
to
her
nephew
,
one
morning
,
"
look
here
.
<EOS>
"
Burgo
was
at
the
time
staying
with
his
aunt
,
in
Gloucester
Square
,
much
to
the
annoyance
of
Sir
Cosmo
,
who
had
become
heartily
tired
of
his
nephew
.
<EOS>
The
aunt
and
the
nephew
had
been
closeted
together
more
than
once
lately
,
and
perhaps
they
understood
each
other
better
now
than
they
had
done
down
at
Monkshade
.
<EOS>
The
aunt
had
handed
a
little
note
to
Burgo
,
which
he
read
and
then
threw
back
to
her
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
You
see
that
she
is
not
afraid
of
coming
,
"
said
Lady
Monk
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
she
does
n't
think
much
about
it
,
"
said
Burgo
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
that
's
what
you
really
believe
,
you
'd
better
give
it
up
.
<EOS>
Nothing
on
earth
would
justify
such
a
step
on
your
part
except
a
thorough
conviction
that
she
is
attached
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Burgo
looked
at
the
fireplace
,
almost
savagely
,
and
his
aunt
looked
at
him
very
keenly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
"
she
said
,
"
if
there
's
to
be
an
end
of
it
,
let
there
be
an
end
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
'd
better
hang
myself
,
"
he
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
Burgo
,
I
will
not
have
you
here
if
you
talk
to
me
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
I
am
trying
to
help
you
once
again
;
but
if
you
look
like
that
,
and
talk
like
that
,
I
will
give
it
up
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
'd
better
give
it
up
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
becoming
cowardly
at
last
?
<EOS>
With
all
your
faults
I
never
expected
that
of
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
I
am
not
a
coward
.
<EOS>
I
'd
go
out
and
fight
him
at
two
paces
'
distance
with
the
greatest
pleasure
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
that
's
nonsense
,
Burgo
.
<EOS>
It
's
downright
braggadocio
.
<EOS>
Men
do
not
fight
now
;
nor
at
any
time
would
a
man
be
called
upon
to
fight
,
because
you
simply
wanted
to
take
his
wife
from
him
.
<EOS>
If
you
had
done
it
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
am
I
to
do
it
?
<EOS>
I
'd
do
it
to
-
morrow
if
it
depended
on
me
.
<EOS>
No
one
can
say
that
I
'm
afraid
of
anybody
or
of
anything
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
something
in
the
matter
depends
on
her
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
she
loves
me
,
 
if
you
mean
that
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Look
here
,
Burgo
,
"
and
the
considerate
aunt
gave
to
the
impoverished
and
ruined
nephew
such
counsel
as
she
,
in
accordance
with
her
lights
,
was
enabled
to
bestow
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
were
much
wronged
in
that
matter
.
<EOS>
After
what
had
passed
I
thought
that
you
had
a
right
to
claim
Lady
Glencora
as
your
wife
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
,
in
my
mind
,
behaved
very
wrongly
in
stepping
in
between
you
and
 
you
and
such
a
fortune
as
hers
,
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
He
can
not
expect
that
his
wife
should
have
any
affection
for
him
.
<EOS>
There
is
nobody
alive
who
has
a
greater
horror
of
anything
improper
in
married
women
than
I
have
.
<EOS>
I
have
always
shown
it
.
<EOS>
When
Lady
Madeline
Madtop
left
her
husband
,
I
would
never
allow
her
to
come
inside
my
doors
again
,
 
though
I
have
no
doubt
he
ill
-
used
her
dreadfully
,
and
there
was
nothing
ever
proved
between
her
and
Colonel
Graham
.
<EOS>
One
ca
n't
be
too
particular
in
such
matters
.
<EOS>
But
here
,
if
you
,
 
if
you
can
succeed
,
you
know
,
I
shall
always
regard
the
Palliser
episode
in
Lady
Glencora
's
life
as
a
tragical
accident
.
<EOS>
I
shall
indeed
.
<EOS>
Poor
dear
!
<EOS>
It
was
done
exactly
as
they
make
nuns
of
girls
in
Roman
Catholic
countries
;
and
as
I
should
think
no
harm
of
helping
a
nun
out
of
her
convent
,
so
I
should
think
no
harm
of
helping
her
now
.
<EOS>
If
you
are
to
say
anything
to
her
,
I
think
you
might
have
an
opportunity
at
the
party
.
"
  
<EOS>
Burgo
was
still
looking
at
the
fireplace
;
and
he
sat
on
,
looking
and
still
looking
,
but
he
said
nothing
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
can
think
of
what
I
have
said
,
Burgo
,
"
continued
his
aunt
,
meaning
that
he
should
get
up
and
go
.
<EOS>
But
he
did
not
go
.
"
<EOS>
Have
you
anything
more
that
you
wish
to
say
to
me
?

"
she
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
've
got
no
money

said
Burgo
,
still
looking
at
the
fireplace
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
's
property
was
worth
not
less
than
fifty
thousand
a
year
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
young
man
ambitious
of
obtaining
that
almost
incredible
amount
of
wealth
,
and
who
once
had
nearly
reached
it
,
by
means
of
her
love
.
<EOS>
His
present
obstacle
consisted
in
his
want
of
a
twenty
-
pound
note
!
<EOS>
"
I
've
got
no
money
.
<EOS>
"
The
words
were
growled
out
rather
than
spoken
,
and
his
eyes
were
never
turned
even
for
a
moment
towards
his
aunt
's
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
've
never
got
any
money
,
"
said
she
,
speaking
almost
with
passion
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
can
I
help
it
?
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
make
money
.
<EOS>
If
I
had
a
couple
of
hundred
pounds
,
so
that
I
could
take
her
,
I
believe
that
she
would
go
with
me
.
<EOS>
It
should
not
be
my
fault
if
she
did
not
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
been
all
right
if
she
had
come
to
Monkshade
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
've
got
no
money
for
you
,
Burgo
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
five
pounds
belonging
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
've
got
 
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
?
"
said
Lady
Monk
,
interrupting
him
sharply
.
  
<EOS>
"
Would
Cosmo
lend
it
me
?
"
<EOS>
said
he
,
hesitating
to
go
on
with
that
suggestion
which
he
had
been
about
to
make
.
<EOS>
The
Cosmo
of
whom
he
spoke
was
not
his
uncle
,
but
his
cousin
.
<EOS>
No
eloquence
could
have
induced
his
uncle
,
Sir
Cosmo
,
to
lend
him
another
shilling
.
<EOS>
But
the
son
of
the
house
was
a
man
rich
with
his
own
wealth
,
and
Burgo
had
not
taxed
him
for
some
years
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
,
"
said
Lady
Monk
.
<EOS>
"
I
never
see
him
.
<EOS>
Probably
not
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
hard
,
"
said
Burgo
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Fancy
that
a
man
should
be
ruined
for
two
hundred
pounds
,
just
at
such
a
moment
of
his
life
as
this
!
"
<EOS>
He
was
a
man
bold
by
nature
,
and
he
did
make
his
proposition
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
jewels
,
aunt
;
 
could
you
not
raise
it
for
me
?
<EOS>
I
would
redeem
them
with
the
very
first
money
that
I
got
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lady
Monk
rose
in
a
passion
when
the
suggestion
was
first
made
,
but
before
the
interview
was
over
she
had
promised
that
she
would
endeavour
to
do
something
in
the
way
of
raising
money
for
him
yet
,
once
again
.
<EOS>
He
was
her
favourite
nephew
,
and
the
same
almost
to
her
as
a
child
of
her
own
.
<EOS>
With
one
of
her
own
children
indeed
she
had
quarrelled
,
and
of
the
other
,
a
married
daughter
,
she
rarely
saw
much
.
<EOS>
Such
love
as
she
had
to
give
she
gave
to
Burgo
,
and
<EOS>
she
promised
him
the
money
though
she
knew
that
she
must
raise
it
by
some
villanous
falsehood
to
her
husband
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
same
morning
Lady
Glencora
went
to
Queen
Anne
Street
with
the
purpose
of
inducing
Alice
to
go
to
Lady
Monk
's
party
;
but
Alice
would
not
accede
to
the
proposition
,
though
Lady
Glencora
pressed
it
with
all
her
eloquence
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
her
,
"
said
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
,
"
that
's
absurd
.
<EOS>
Half
the
people
there
wo
n't
know
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
they
know
her
set
,
or
know
her
friends
,
 
or
,
at
any
rate
,
will
meet
their
own
friends
at
her
house
.
<EOS>
I
should
only
bother
you
,
and
should
not
in
the
least
gratify
myself
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
fact
is
,
everybody
will
go
who
can
,
and
I
should
have
no
sort
of
trouble
in
getting
a
card
for
you
.
<EOS>
Indeed
I
should
simply
write
a
note
and
say
I
meant
to
bring
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Pray
do
n't
do
any
such
thing
,
for
I
certainly
shall
not
go
.
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
conceive
why
you
should
wish
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Mr.
Fitzgerald
will
be
there
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
,
altering
her
voice
altogether
,
and
speaking
in
that
low
tone
with
which
she
used
to
win
Alice
's
heart
down
at
Matching
.
<EOS>
She
was
sitting
close
over
the
fire
,
leaning
low
,
holding
up
her
little
hands
as
a
screen
to
her
face
,
and
looking
at
her
companion
earnestly
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
sure
that
he
will
be
there
,
though
nobody
has
told
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
may
be
a
reason
for
your
staying
away
,
"
said
Alice
,
slowly
,
"
but
hardly
a
reason
for
my
going
with
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
would
not
condescend
to
tell
her
friend
in
so
many
words
that
she
wanted
her
protection
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
bring
herself
to
say
that
,
though
she
wished
it
to
be
understood
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
I
thought
you
would
have
gone
,
"
said
she
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
contrary
to
all
my
habits
,
"
said
Alice
:
"
<EOS>
I
never
go
to
people
's
houses
when
I
do
n't
know
them
.
<EOS>
It
's
a
kind
of
society
which
I
do
n't
like
.
<EOS>
Pray
do
not
ask
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
very
well
.
<EOS>
If
it
must
be
so
,
I
wo
n't
press
it
.
"
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
had
moved
the
position
of
one
of
her
hands
so
as
to
get
it
to
her
pocket
,
and
there
had
grasped
a
letter
,
which
she
still
carried
;
but
when
Alice
said
those
last
cold
words
,
"
Pray
do
not
ask
me
,
"
<EOS>
she
released
the
grasp
,
and
left
the
letter
where
it
was
.
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
he
wo
n't
bite
me
,
at
any
rate
,
"
she
said
,
and
she
assumed
that
look
of
childish
drollery
which
she
would
sometimes
put
on
,
almost
with
a
grimace
,
but
still
with
so
much
prettiness
that
no
one
who
saw
her
would
regret
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
certainly
ca
n't
bite
you
,
if
you
will
not
let
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
know
,
Alice
,
though
they
all
say
that
Plantagenet
is
one
of
the
wisest
men
in
London
,
I
sometimes
think
that
he
is
one
of
the
greatest
fools
.
<EOS>
Soon
after
we
came
to
town
I
told
him
that
we
had
better
not
go
to
that
woman
's
house
.
<EOS>
Of
course
he
understood
me
.
<EOS>
He
simply
said
that
he
wished
that
I
should
do
so
.
<EOS>
"
I
hate
anything
out
of
the
way
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
There
can
be
no
reason
why
my
wife
should
not
go
to
Lady
Monk
's
house
as
well
as
to
any
other
.
<EOS>
"
There
was
an
end
of
it
,
you
know
,
as
far
as
anything
I
could
do
was
concerned
.
<EOS>
But
there
was
n't
an
end
of
it
with
him
.
<EOS>
He
insists
that
I
shall
go
,
but
he
sends
my
duenna
with
me
.
<EOS>
Dear
Mrs.
Marsham
is
to
be
there
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
'll
do
you
no
harm
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
not
so
sure
of
that
,
Alice
.
<EOS>
In
the
first
place
,
one
does
n't
like
to
be
followed
everywhere
by
a
policeman
,
even
though
one
is
n't
going
to
pick
a
pocket
.
<EOS>
And
then
,
the
devil
is
so
strong
within
me
,
that
I
should
like
to
dodge
the
policeman
.
<EOS>
I
can
fancy
a
woman
being
driven
to
do
wrong
simply
by
a
desire
to
show
her
policeman
that
she
can
be
too
many
for
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Glencora
,
you
make
me
so
wretched
when
you
talk
like
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Will
you
go
with
me
,
then
,
so
that
I
may
have
a
policeman
of
my
own
choosing
?
<EOS>
He
asked
me
if
I
would
mind
taking
Mrs.
Marsham
with
me
in
my
carriage
.
<EOS>
So
I
up
and
spoke
,
very
boldly
,
like
the
proud
young
porter
,
and
told
him
I
would
not
;
<EOS>
and
when
he
asked
why
not
,
I
said
that
I
preferred
taking
a
friend
of
my
own
,
 
a
young
friend
,
I
said
,
and
I
then
named
you
or
my
cousin
,
Lady
Jane
.
<EOS>
I
told
him
I
should
bring
one
or
the
other
.
"
  
"
And
was
he
angry
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
he
took
it
very
quietly
,
 
saying
something
,
in
his
calm
way
,
about
hoping
that
I
should
get
over
a
prejudice
against
one
of
his
earliest
and
dearest
friends
.
<EOS>
He
twits
at
me
because
I
do
n't
understand
Parliament
and
the
British
Constitution
,
but
<EOS>
I
know
more
of
them
than
he
does
about
a
woman
.
<EOS>
You
are
quite
sure
you
wo
n't
go
,
then
?
"
<EOS>
Alice
hesitated
a
moment
.
<EOS>
"
Do
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
;
and
there
was
an
amount
of
persuasion
in
her
accent
which
should
,
I
think
,
have
overcome
her
cousin
's
scruples
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
against
the
whole
tenor
of
my
life
's
way
,
"
she
said
,
"
<EOS>
And
,
Glencora
,
I
am
not
happy
myself
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
fit
for
parties
.
<EOS>
I
sometimes
think
that
I
shall
never
go
into
society
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
nonsense
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
it
is
,
but
I
can
not
go
now
.
<EOS>
I
would
if
I
really
thought
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
Oh
,
very
well
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
,
interrupting
her
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I
suppose
I
shall
get
through
it
.
<EOS>
If
he
asks
me
to
dance
,
I
shall
stand
up
with
him
,
just
as
though
I
had
never
seen
him
before
.
"
<EOS>
Then
she
remembered
the
letter
in
her
pocket
,
 
remembered
that
at
this
moment
she
bore
about
with
her
a
written
proposition
from
this
man
to
go
off
with
him
and
leave
her
husband
's
house
.
<EOS>
She
had
intended
to
show
it
to
Alice
on
this
occasion
;
but
as
Alice
had
refused
her
request
,
she
was
glad
that
she
had
not
done
so
.
<EOS>
"
You
'll
come
to
me
the
morning
after
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
,
as
she
went
.
<EOS>
This
Alice
promised
to
do
;
and
then
she
was
left
alone
.
  
<EOS>
Alice
regretted
,
 
regretted
deeply
that
she
had
not
consented
to
go
with
her
cousin
.
<EOS>
After
all
,
of
what
importance
had
been
her
objection
when
compared
with
the
cause
for
which
her
presence
had
been
desired
?
<EOS>
Doubtless
she
would
have
been
uncomfortable
at
Lady
Monk
's
house
;
but
could
she
not
have
borne
some
hour
or
two
of
discomfort
on
her
friend
's
behalf
?
<EOS>
But
,
in
truth
,
it
was
only
after
Lady
Glencora
had
left
her
that
she
began
to
understand
the
subject
fully
,
and
to
feel
that
she
might
possibly
have
been
of
service
in
a
great
danger
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
too
late
now
.
<EOS>
Then
she
strove
to
comfort
herself
with
the
reflection
that
a
casual
meeting
at
an
evening
party
in
London
could
not
be
perilous
in
the
same
degree
as
a
prolonged
sojourn
together
in
a
country
house
.
   
<EOS>
How
Lady
Glencora
Went
to
Lady
Monk
's
Party
.
 
<EOS>
Lady
Monk
's
house
in
Gloucester
Square
was
admirably
well
adapted
for
the
giving
of
parties
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
large
house
,
and
seemed
to
the
eyes
of
guests
to
be
much
larger
than
it
was
.
<EOS>
The
hall
was
spacious
,
and
the
stairs
went
up
in
the
centre
,
facing
you
as
you
entered
the
inner
hall
.
<EOS>
Round
the
top
of
the
stairs
there
was
a
broad
gallery
,
with
an
ornamented
railing
,
and
from
this
opened
the
doors
into
the
three
reception
-
rooms
.
<EOS>
There
were
two
on
the
right
,
the
larger
of
which
looked
out
backwards
,
and
these
two
were
connected
by
an
archway
,
as
though
made
for
folding
-
doors
;
but
the
doors
,
I
believe
,
never
were
there
.
<EOS>
Fronting
the
top
of
the
staircase
there
was
a
smaller
room
,
looking
out
backwards
,
very
prettily
furnished
,
and
much
used
by
Lady
Monk
when
alone
.
<EOS>
It
was
here
that
Burgo
had
held
that
conference
with
his
aunt
of
which
mention
has
been
made
.
<EOS>
Below
stairs
there
was
the
great
dining
-
room
,
on
which
,
on
these
occasions
,
a
huge
buffet
was
erected
for
refreshments
,
 
what
I
may
call
a
masculine
buffet
,
as
it
was
attended
by
butlers
and
men
in
livery
,
 
and
there
was
a
smaller
room
looking
out
into
the
square
,
in
which
there
was
a
feminine
battery
for
the
dispensing
of
tea
and
such
like
smaller
good
things
,
and
from
which
female
aid
could
be
attained
for
the
arrangement
or
mending
of
dresses
in
a
further
sanctum
within
it
.
<EOS>
For
such
purposes
as
that
now
on
foot
the
house
was
most
commodious
.
<EOS>
Lady
Monk
,
on
these
occasions
,
was
moved
by
a
noble
ambition
to
do
something
different
from
that
done
by
her
neighbours
in
similar
circumstances
,
and
therefore
she
never
came
forward
to
receive
her
guests
.
<EOS>
She
ensconced
herself
,
early
in
the
evening
,
in
that
room
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
,
and
there
they
who
chose
to
see
her
made
their
way
up
to
her
,
and
spoke
their
little
speeches
.
<EOS>
They
who
thought
her
to
be
a
great
woman
,
 
and
many
people
did
think
her
to
be
great
,
 
were
wo
nt
to
declare
that
she
never
forgot
those
who
did
come
,
or
those
who
did
not
.
<EOS>
And
even
they
who
desired
to
describe
her
as
little
,
 
for
even
Lady
Monk
had
enemies
,
 
would
hint
that
though
she
never
came
out
of
the
room
,
she
would
rise
from
her
chair
and
make
a
step
towards
the
door
whenever
any
name
very
high
in
fashionable
life
greeted
her
ears
.
<EOS>
So
that
a
mighty
Cabinet
Minister
,
or
a
duchess
in
great
repute
,
or
any
special
wonder
of
the
season
,
could
not
fail
of
entering
her
precincts
and
being
seen
there
for
a
few
moments
.
<EOS>
It
would
,
of
course
,
happen
that
the
doorway
of
her
chamber
would
become
blocked
;
but
there
were
precautions
taken
to
avoid
this
inconvenience
as
far
as
possible
,
and
one
man
in
livery
was
employed
to
go
backwards
and
forwards
between
his
mistress
and
the
outer
world
,
so
as
to
keep
the
thread
of
a
passage
open
.
  
<EOS>
But
though
Lady
Monk
was
in
this
way
enabled
to
rest
herself
during
her
labours
,
there
was
much
in
her
night
's
work
which
was
not
altogether
exhilarating
.
<EOS>
Ladies
would
come
into
her
small
room
and
sit
there
by
the
hour
,
with
whom
she
had
not
the
slightest
wish
to
hold
conversation
.
<EOS>
The
Duchess
of
St.
Bungay
would
always
be
there
,
 
so
that
there
was
a
special
seat
in
one
corner
of
the
room
which
was
called
the
Duchess
"
stool
.
<EOS>
"
I
should
n't
care
a
straw
about
her
,
"
Lady
Monk
had
been
heard
to
complain
,
"
if
she
would
talk
to
anybody
.
<EOS>
But
nobody
will
talk
to
her
,
and
then
she
listens
to
everything
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
had
been
another
word
or
two
between
Burgo
Fitzgerald
and
his
aunt
before
the
evening
came
,
a
word
or
two
in
the
speaking
of
which
she
had
found
some
difficulty
.
<EOS>
She
was
prepared
with
the
money
,
 
with
that
two
hundred
pounds
for
which
he
had
asked
,
 
obtained
with
what
wiles
,
and
lies
,
and
baseness
of
subterfuge
I
need
not
stop
here
to
describe
.
<EOS>
But
she
was
by
no
means
willing
to
give
this
over
into
her
nephew
's
hands
without
security
.
<EOS>
She
was
willing
to
advance
him
this
money
;
she
had
been
willing
even
to
go
through
unusual
dirt
to
get
it
for
him
;
but
she
was
desirous
that
he
should
have
it
only
for
a
certain
purpose
.
<EOS>
How
could
she
bind
him
down
to
spend
it
as
she
would
have
it
spent
?
<EOS>
Could
she
undertake
to
hand
it
to
him
as
soon
as
Lady
Glencora
should
be
in
his
power
?
<EOS>
Even
though
she
could
have
brought
herself
to
say
as
much
,
 
and
I
think
she
might
also
have
done
so
after
what
she
had
said
,
 
she
could
not
have
carried
out
such
a
plan
.
<EOS>
In
that
case
the
want
would
be
instant
,
and
the
action
must
be
rapid
.
<EOS>
She
therefore
had
no
alternative
but
to
entrust
him
with
the
bank
-
notes
at
once
.
<EOS>
"
Burgo
,
"
she
said
,
"
if
I
find
that
you
deceive
me
now
,
I
will
never
trust
you
again
.
"
<EOS>
"
All
right
,
"
said
Burgo
,
as
he
barely
counted
the
money
before
he
thrust
it
into
his
breast
-
pocket
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
lent
to
you
for
a
certain
purpose
,
should
you
happen
to
want
it
,
"
she
said
,
solemnly
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
happen
to
want
it
very
much
,
"
he
answered
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
dare
to
say
more
;
but
as
her
nephew
turned
away
from
her
with
a
step
that
was
quite
light
in
its
gaiety
,
she
almost
felt
that
she
was
already
cozened
.
<EOS>
Let
Burgo
's
troubles
be
as
heavy
as
they
might
be
,
there
was
something
to
him
ecstatic
in
the
touch
of
ready
money
which
always
cured
them
for
the
moment
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
morning
of
Lady
Monk
's
party
a
few
very
uncomfortable
words
passed
between
Mr.
Palliser
and
his
wife
.
  
<EOS>
"
Your
cousin
is
not
going
,
then
?
"
said
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
Alice
is
not
going
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
you
can
give
Mrs.
Marsham
a
seat
in
your
carriage
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Impossible
,
Plantagenet
.
<EOS>
I
thought
I
had
told
you
that
I
had
promised
my
cousin
Jane
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
can
take
three
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
I
ca
n't
,
 
unless
you
would
like
me
to
sit
out
with
the
coachman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
something
in
this
,
 
a
tone
of
loudness
,
a
touch
of
what
he
called
to
himself
vulgarity
,
 
which
made
him
very
angry
.
<EOS>
So
he
turned
away
from
her
,
and
looked
as
black
as
a
thundercloud
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
know
,
Plantagenet
,
"
she
went
on
,
"
that
it
is
impossible
for
three
women
dressed
to
go
out
in
one
carriage
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
you
would
n't
like
to
see
me
afterwards
<EOS>
if
I
had
been
one
of
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
need
not
have
said
anything
to
Lady
Jane
when
Miss
Vavasor
refused
.
<EOS>
I
had
asked
you
before
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
had
told
you
that
I
liked
going
with
young
women
,
and
not
with
old
ones
.
<EOS>
That
's
the
long
and
the
short
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Glencora
,
I
wish
you
would
not
use
such
expressions
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
!
<EOS>
not
the
long
and
the
short
?
<EOS>
It
's
good
English
.
<EOS>
Quite
as
good
as
Mr.
Bott
's
,
when
he
said
in
the
House
the
other
night
that
the
Government
kept
their
accounts
in
a
higgledy
-
piggledy
way
.
<EOS>
You
see
,
I
have
been
studying
the
debates
,
and
you
should
n't
be
angry
with
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
angry
with
you
.
<EOS>
You
speak
like
a
child
to
say
so
.
<EOS>
Then
,
I
suppose
,
the
carriage
must
go
for
Mrs.
Marsham
after
it
has
taken
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
shall
go
before
.
<EOS>
Jane
will
not
be
in
a
hurry
,
and
I
am
sure
I
shall
not
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
will
think
you
very
uncivil
;
that
is
all
.
<EOS>
I
told
her
that
she
could
go
with
you
when
I
heard
that
Miss
Vavasor
was
not
to
be
there
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
,
Plantagenet
,
you
should
n't
have
told
her
so
,
and
that
's
the
long
 
;
but
I
must
n't
say
that
.
<EOS>
The
truth
is
this
,
if
you
give
me
any
orders
I
'll
obey
them
,
 
as
far
as
I
can
.
<EOS>
If
I
ca
n't
I
'll
say
so
.
<EOS>
But
if
I
'm
left
to
go
by
my
own
judgement
,
it
's
not
fair
that
I
should
be
scolded
afterwards
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
never
scolded
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
you
have
.
<EOS>
You
have
told
me
that
I
was
uncivil
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
said
that
she
would
think
you
so
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
,
if
it
's
only
what
she
thinks
,
I
do
n't
care
two
straws
about
it
.
<EOS>
She
may
have
the
carriage
to
herself
if
she
likes
,
but
she
sha
n't
have
me
in
it
,
 
not
unless
I
'm
ordered
to
go
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
like
her
,
and
I
wo
n't
pretend
to
like
her
.
<EOS>
My
belief
is
that
she
follows
me
about
to
tell
you
if
she
thinks
that
I
do
wrong
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Glencora
!
"
  
"
And
that
odious
baboon
with
the
red
bristles
does
the
same
thing
,
 
only
he
goes
to
her
because
he
does
n't
dare
to
go
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Plantagenet
Palliser
was
struck
wild
with
dismay
.
<EOS>
He
understood
well
who
it
was
whom
his
wife
intended
to
describe
;
but
that
she
should
have
spoken
of
any
man
as
a
baboon
with
red
bristles
,
was
terrible
to
his
mind
!
<EOS>
He
was
beginning
to
think
that
he
hardly
knew
how
to
manage
his
wife
.
<EOS>
And
the
picture
she
had
drawn
was
very
distressing
to
him
.
<EOS>
She
had
no
mother
;
neither
had
he
;
and
he
had
wished
that
Mrs.
Marsham
should
give
to
her
some
of
that
matronly
assistance
and
guidance
which
a
mother
does
give
to
her
young
married
daughter
.
<EOS>
It
was
true
,
too
,
as
he
knew
,
that
a
word
or
two
as
to
some
socially
domestic
matters
had
filtered
through
to
him
from
Mr.
Bott
,
down
at
Matching
Priory
,
but
only
in
such
a
way
as
to
enable
him
to
see
what
counsel
it
was
needful
that
he
should
give
.
<EOS>
As
for
espionage
over
his
wife
,
 
no
man
could
despise
it
more
than
he
did
!
<EOS>
No
man
would
be
less
willing
to
resort
to
it
!
<EOS>
And
now
his
wife
was
accusing
him
of
keeping
spies
,
both
male
and
female
.
  
<EOS>
"
Glencora
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
again
;
and
then
he
stopped
,
not
knowing
what
to
say
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
my
dear
,
it
's
better
you
should
know
at
once
what
I
feel
about
it
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
suppose
I
'm
very
good
;
indeed
I
dare
say
I
'm
bad
enough
,
but
these
people
about
me
wo
n't
make
me
any
better
.
<EOS>
The
duennas
do
n't
make
the
Spanish
ladies
worth
much
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Duennas
!
"
<EOS>
After
that
,
Lady
Glencora
sat
herself
down
,
and
Mr.
Palliser
stood
for
some
moments
looking
at
her
.
  
<EOS>
It
ended
in
his
making
her
a
long
speech
,
in
which
he
said
a
good
deal
of
his
own
justice
and
forbearance
,
and
something
also
of
her
frivolity
and
childishness
.
<EOS>
He
told
her
that
his
only
complaint
of
her
was
that
she
was
too
young
,
and
,
as
he
did
so
,
she
made
a
little
grimace
,
 
not
to
him
,
but
to
herself
,
as
though
saying
to
herself
that
that
was
all
he
knew
about
it
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
notice
it
,
or
,
if
he
did
,
his
notice
did
not
stop
his
eloquence
.
<EOS>
He
assured
her
that
he
was
far
from
keeping
any
watch
over
her
,
and
declared
that
she
had
altogether
mistaken
Mrs.
Marsham
's
character
.
<EOS>
Then
there
was
another
little
grimace
.
<EOS>
"
There
's
somebody
has
mistaken
it
worse
than
I
have
,
"
the
grimace
said
.
<EOS>
Of
the
bristly
baboon
he
condescended
to
say
nothing
,
and
he
wound
up
by
giving
her
a
cold
kiss
,
and
saying
that
he
would
meet
her
at
Lady
Monk
's
.
  
<EOS>
When
the
evening
came
,
 
or
rather
the
night
,
 
the
carriage
went
first
for
Mrs.
Marsham
,
and
having
deposited
her
at
Lady
Monk
's
,
went
back
to
Park
Lane
for
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
Then
she
had
herself
driven
to
St.
James
's
Square
,
to
pick
up
Lady
Jane
,
so
that
altogether
the
coachman
and
horses
did
not
have
a
good
time
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
I
wish
he
'd
keep
a
separate
carriage
for
her
,
"
Lady
Glencora
said
to
her
cousin
Jane
,
 
having
perceived
that
her
servants
were
not
in
a
good
humour
.
"
<EOS>
That
would
be
expensive
,
"
said
Lady
Jane
.
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
it
would
be
expensive
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
She
would
not
condescend
to
make
any
remark
as
to
the
non
-
importance
of
such
expense
to
a
man
so
wealthy
as
her
husband
,
knowing
that
his
wealth
was
,
in
fact
,
hers
.
<EOS>
Never
to
him
or
to
any
other
,
 
not
even
to
herself
,
 
had
she
hinted
that
much
was
due
to
her
because
she
had
been
magnificent
as
an
heiress
.
<EOS>
There
were
many
things
about
this
woman
that
were
not
altogether
what
a
husband
might
wish
.
<EOS>
She
was
not
softly
delicate
in
all
her
ways
;
but
in
disposition
and
temper
she
was
altogether
generous
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
that
she
was
at
all
points
a
lady
,
but
had
Fate
so
willed
it
<EOS>
she
would
have
been
a
thorough
gentleman
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Marsham
was
by
no
means
satisfied
with
the
way
in
which
she
was
treated
.
<EOS>
She
would
not
have
cared
to
go
at
all
to
Lady
Monk
's
party
<EOS>
had
she
supposed
that
she
would
have
to
make
her
entry
there
alone
.
<EOS>
With
Lady
Glencora
she
would
have
seemed
to
receive
some
of
that
homage
which
would
certainly
have
been
paid
to
her
companion
.
<EOS>
The
carriage
called
,
moreover
,
before
she
was
fully
ready
,
and
the
footman
,
as
he
stood
at
the
door
to
hand
her
in
,
had
been
very
sulky
.
<EOS>
She
understood
it
all
.
<EOS>
She
knew
that
Lady
Glencora
had
positively
declined
her
companionship
;
and
if
she
resolved
to
be
revenged
,
such
resolution
on
her
part
was
only
natural
.
<EOS>
When
she
reached
Lady
Monk
's
house
,
she
had
to
make
her
way
up
stairs
all
alone
.
<EOS>
The
servants
called
her
Mrs.
Marsh
,
and
under
that
name
she
got
passed
on
into
the
front
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
There
she
sat
down
,
not
having
seen
Lady
Monk
,
and
meditated
over
her
injuries
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
past
eleven
before
Lady
Glencora
arrived
,
and
Burgo
Fitzgerald
had
begun
to
think
that
his
evil
stars
intended
that
he
should
never
see
her
again
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
wickedly
baulked
at
Monkshade
,
by
what
influence
he
had
never
yet
ascertained
;
and
now
he
thought
that
the
same
influence
must
be
at
work
to
keep
her
again
away
from
his
aunt
's
house
.
<EOS>
He
had
settled
in
his
mind
no
accurate
plan
of
a
campaign
;
he
had
in
his
thoughts
no
fixed
arrangement
by
which
he
might
do
the
thing
which
he
meditated
.
<EOS>
He
had
attempted
to
make
some
such
plan
;
but
,
as
is
the
case
with
all
men
to
whom
thinking
is
an
unusual
operation
,
concluded
at
last
that
he
had
better
leave
it
to
the
course
of
events
.
<EOS>
It
was
,
however
,
obviously
necessary
that
he
should
see
Lady
Glencora
before
the
course
of
events
could
be
made
to
do
anything
for
him
.
<EOS>
He
had
written
to
her
,
making
his
proposition
in
bold
terms
,
and
he
felt
that
if
she
were
utterly
decided
against
him
,
her
anger
at
his
suggestion
,
or
at
least
her
refusal
,
would
have
been
made
known
to
him
in
some
way
.
<EOS>
Silence
did
not
absolutely
give
consent
,
but
it
seemed
to
show
that
consent
was
not
impossible
.
<EOS>
From
ten
o'clock
to
past
eleven
he
stood
about
on
the
staircase
of
his
aunt
's
house
,
waiting
for
the
name
which
he
was
desirous
of
hearing
,
and
which
he
almost
feared
to
hear
.
<EOS>
Men
spoke
to
him
,
and
women
also
,
but
he
hardly
answered
.
<EOS>
His
aunt
once
called
him
into
her
room
,
and
with
a
cautionary
frown
on
her
brow
,
bade
him
go
dance
.
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
look
so
dreadfully
preoccupied
,
"
she
said
to
him
in
a
whisper
.
<EOS>
But
he
shook
his
head
at
her
,
almost
savagely
,
and
went
away
,
and
did
not
dance
.
<EOS>
Dance
!
<EOS>
How
was
he
to
dance
with
such
an
enterprise
as
that
upon
his
mind
?
<EOS>
Even
to
Burgo
Fitzgerald
the
task
of
running
away
with
another
man
's
wife
had
in
it
something
which
prevented
dancing
.
<EOS>
Lady
Monk
was
older
,
and
was
able
to
regulate
her
feelings
with
more
exactness
.
<EOS>
But
Burgo
,
though
he
could
not
dance
,
went
down
into
the
dining
-
room
and
drank
.
<EOS>
He
took
a
large
beer
-
glass
full
of
champagne
and
soon
after
that
another
.
<EOS>
The
drink
did
not
flush
his
cheeks
or
make
his
forehead
red
,
or
bring
out
the
sweat
-
drops
on
his
brow
,
as
it
does
with
some
men
;
but
it
added
a
peculiar
brightness
to
his
blue
eyes
.
<EOS>
It
was
by
the
light
of
his
eyes
that
men
knew
when
Burgo
had
been
drinking
.
  
<EOS>
At
last
,
while
he
was
still
in
the
supper
room
,
he
heard
Lady
Glencora
's
name
announced
.
<EOS>
He
had
already
seen
Mr.
Palliser
come
in
and
make
his
way
<EOS>
up
-
stairs
some
quarter
of
an
hour
before
;
but
as
to
that
he
was
indifferent
.
<EOS>
He
had
known
that
the
husband
was
to
be
there
.
<EOS>
When
the
long
-
expected
name
reached
his
ears
,
his
heart
seemed
to
jump
within
him
.
<EOS>
What
,
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
,
should
he
do
?
<EOS>
As
he
had
resolved
that
he
would
be
doing
,
 
that
something
should
be
done
,
let
it
be
what
it
might
,
 
he
hurried
to
the
dining
-
room
door
,
and
was
just
in
time
to
see
and
be
seen
as
Lady
Glencora
was
passing
up
the
stairs
.
<EOS>
She
was
just
above
him
as
he
got
himself
out
into
the
hall
,
so
that
he
could
not
absolutely
greet
her
with
his
hand
;
but
he
looked
up
at
her
,
and
caught
her
eye
.
<EOS>
He
looked
up
,
and
moved
his
hand
to
her
in
token
of
salutation
.
<EOS>
She
looked
down
at
him
,
and
the
expression
of
her
face
altered
visibly
as
her
glance
met
his
.
<EOS>
She
barely
bowed
to
him
,
 
with
her
eyes
rather
than
with
her
head
,
but
he
flattered
himself
that
there
was
,
at
any
rate
,
no
anger
in
her
countenance
.
<EOS>
How
beautiful
he
was
as
he
gazed
up
at
her
,
leaning
against
the
wall
as
he
stood
,
and
watching
her
as
she
made
her
slow
way
up
the
stairs
!
<EOS>
She
felt
that
his
eyes
were
on
her
,
and
where
the
stairs
turned
she
could
not
restrain
herself
from
one
other
glance
.
<EOS>
As
her
eyes
fell
on
his
again
,
his
mouth
opened
,
and
she
fancied
that
she
could
hear
the
faint
sigh
that
he
uttered
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
glorious
mouth
,
such
as
the
old
sculptors
gave
to
their
marble
gods
!
<EOS>
And
Burgo
,
if
it
was
so
that
he
had
not
heart
enough
to
love
truly
,
could
look
as
though
he
loved
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
in
him
deceit
,
 
or
what
men
call
acting
.
<EOS>
The
expression
came
to
him
naturally
,
though
it
expressed
so
much
more
than
there
was
within
;
as
strong
words
come
to
some
men
who
have
no
knowledge
that
they
are
speaking
strongly
.
<EOS>
At
this
moment
Burgo
Fitzgerald
looked
as
though
it
were
possible
that
he
might
die
of
love
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
was
met
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
by
Lady
Monk
,
who
came
out
to
her
,
almost
into
the
gallery
,
with
her
sweetest
smile
,
 
so
that
the
newly
-
arrived
guest
,
of
course
,
entered
into
the
small
room
.
<EOS>
There
sat
the
Duchess
of
St.
Bungay
on
her
stool
in
the
corner
,
and
there
,
next
to
the
Duchess
,
but
at
the
moment
engaged
in
no
conversation
,
stood
Mr.
Bott
.
<EOS>
There
was
another
lady
there
,
who
stood
very
high
in
the
world
,
and
whom
Lady
Monk
was
very
glad
to
welcome
 
the
young
Marchioness
of
Hartletop
.
<EOS>
She
was
in
slight
mourning
;
for
her
father
-
in
-
law
,
the
late
Marquis
,
had
died
no
t
yet
quite
six
months
since
.
<EOS>
Very
beautiful
she
was
,
and
one
whose
presence
at
their
houses
ladies
and
gentlemen
prized
alike
.
<EOS>
She
never
said
silly
things
,
like
the
Duchess
,
never
was
troublesome
as
to
people
's
conduct
to
her
,
was
always
gracious
,
yet
was
never
led
away
into
intimacies
,
was
without
peer
the
best
-
dressed
woman
in
London
,
and
yet
gave
herself
no
airs
;
 
<EOS>
and
then
she
was
so
exquisitely
beautiful
.
<EOS>
Her
smile
was
loveliness
itself
.
<EOS>
There
were
,
indeed
,
people
who
said
that
it
meant
nothing
;
but
then
,
what
should
the
smile
of
a
young
married
woman
mean
?
<EOS>
She
had
not
been
born
in
the
purple
,
like
Lady
Glencora
,
her
father
being
a
country
clergyman
who
had
never
reached
a
higher
grade
than
that
of
an
archdeacon
;
but
she
knew
the
ways
of
high
life
,
and
what
an
exigeant
husband
would
demand
of
her
,
much
better
than
poor
Glencora
.
<EOS>
She
would
have
spoken
of
no
man
as
a
baboon
with
a
bristly
beard
.
<EOS>
She
never
talked
of
the
long
and
the
short
of
it
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
wander
out
o
'
nights
in
winter
among
the
ruins
.
<EOS>
She
made
no
fast
friendship
with
ladies
whom
her
lord
did
not
like
.
<EOS>
She
had
once
,
indeed
,
been
approached
by
a
lover
since
she
had
been
married
,
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
himself
having
been
the
offender
,
 
<EOS>
but
she
had
turned
the
affair
to
infinite
credit
and
profit
,
had
gained
her
husband
's
closest
confidence
by
telling
him
of
it
all
,
had
yet
not
brought
on
any
hostile
collision
,
and
had
even
dismissed
her
lover
without
annoying
him
.
<EOS>
But
then
Lady
Hartletop
was
a
miracle
of
a
woman
!
  
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
was
no
miracle
.
<EOS>
Though
born
in
the
purple
,
she
was
made
of
ordinary
flesh
and
blood
,
and
as
she
entered
Lady
Monk
's
little
room
,
hardly
knew
how
to
recover
herself
sufficiently
for
the
purposes
of
ordinary
conversation
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Dear
Lady
Glencora
,
do
come
in
for
a
moment
to
my
den
.
<EOS>
We
were
so
sorry
not
to
have
you
at
Monkshade
.
<EOS>
We
heard
such
terrible
things
about
your
health
.
"
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
said
that
it
was
only
a
cold
,
 
a
bad
cold
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
yes
;
we
heard
,
 
something
about
moonlight
and
ruins
.
<EOS>
So
like
you
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
I
love
that
sort
of
thing
,
above
all
people
;
but
it
does
n't
do
;
does
it
?
<EOS>
Circumstances
are
so
exacting
.
<EOS>
I
think
you
know
Lady
Hartletop
;
 
and
there
's
the
Duchess
of
St.
Bungay
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
was
here
five
minutes
since
.
"
<EOS>
Then
Lady
Monk
was
obliged
to
get
to
her
door
again
and
Lady
Glencora
found
herself
standing
close
to
Lady
Hartletop
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
saw
Mr.
Palliser
just
pass
through
,
"
said
Lady
Hartletop
,
who
was
able
to
meet
and
speak
of
the
man
who
had
dared
to
approach
her
with
his
love
,
without
the
slightest
nervousness
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
he
said
he
should
be
here
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
a
great
crowd
,
"
said
Lady
Hartletop
.
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
think
London
was
so
full
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
great
.
"
said
Lady
Glencora
,
and
<EOS>
then
they
had
said
to
each
other
all
that
society
required
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
,
as
we
know
,
could
talk
with
imprudent
vehemence
by
the
hour
together
if
she
liked
her
companion
;
but
the
other
lady
seldom
committed
herself
by
more
words
than
she
had
uttered
now
,
 
unless
it
was
to
her
tirewoman
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
very
well
you
are
looking
,
"
said
the
Duchess
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
I
heard
you
had
been
so
ill
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Of
that
midnight
escapade
among
the
ruins
it
was
fated
that
Lady
Glencora
should
never
hear
the
last
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
d'ye
do
,
Lady
Glencowrer
?
"
sounded
in
her
ear
,
and
there
was
a
great
red
paw
stuck
out
for
her
to
take
.
<EOS>
But
after
what
had
passed
between
Lady
Glencora
and
her
husband
to
-
day
about
Mr.
Bott
,
she
was
determined
that
she
would
not
take
Mr.
Bott
's
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
are
you
,
Mr.
Bott
?
<EOS>
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
'll
look
for
Mr.
Palliser
in
the
back
room
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
Lady
Glencora
,
"
whispered
the
Duchess
,
in
an
ecstasy
of
agony
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
turned
and
bowed
her
head
to
her
stout
friend
.
<EOS>
"
Do
let
me
go
away
with
you
.
<EOS>
There
's
that
woman
,
Mrs.
Conway
Sparkes
,
coming
,
and
you
know
how
I
hate
her
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
take
the
Duchess
under
her
wing
,
and
they
passed
into
the
large
room
together
.
<EOS>
It
is
,
I
think
,
more
than
probable
that
Mrs.
Conway
Sparkes
had
been
brought
in
by
Lady
Monk
as
the
only
way
of
removing
the
Duchess
from
her
stool
.
  
<EOS>
Just
within
the
dancing
-
room
Lady
Glencora
found
her
husband
,
standing
in
a
corner
,
looking
as
though
he
were
making
calculations
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
going
away
,
"
said
he
,
coming
up
to
her
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I
only
just
came
because
I
said
I
would
.
<EOS>
Shall
you
be
late
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
no
;
I
suppose
not
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Shall
you
dance
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
once
,
 
just
to
show
that
I
'm
not
an
old
woman
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
n't
heat
yourself
.
<EOS>
Good
-
bye
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Then
he
went
,
and
in
the
crush
of
the
doorway
he
passed
Burgo
Fitzgerald
,
whose
eye
was
intently
fixed
upon
his
wife
.
<EOS>
He
looked
at
Burgo
,
and
some
thought
of
that
young
man
's
former
hopes
flashed
across
his
mind
,
 
some
remembrance
,
too
,
of
a
caution
that
had
been
whispered
to
him
;
but
for
no
moment
did
a
suspicion
come
to
him
that
he
ought
to
stop
and
watch
by
his
wife
.
   
<EOS>
How
Lady
Glencora
Came
Back
from
Lady
Monk
's
Party
.
 
<EOS>
Burgo
Fitzgerald
remained
for
a
minute
or
two
leaning
where
we
last
saw
him
,
 
against
the
dining
-
room
wall
at
the
bottom
of
the
staircase
;
and
as
he
did
so
some
thoughts
that
were
almost
solemn
passed
across
his
mind
,
This
thing
that
he
was
about
to
do
,
or
to
attempt
,
 
was
it
in
itself
a
good
thing
,
and
would
it
be
good
for
her
whom
he
pretended
to
love
?
<EOS>
What
would
be
her
future
if
she
consented
now
to
go
with
him
,
and
to
divide
herself
from
her
husband
?
<EOS>
Of
his
own
future
he
thought
not
at
all
.
<EOS>
He
had
never
done
so
.
<EOS>
Even
when
he
had
first
found
himself
attracted
by
the
reputation
of
her
wealth
,
he
can
not
be
said
to
have
looked
forward
in
any
prudential
way
to
coming
years
.
<EOS>
His
desire
to
put
himself
in
possession
of
so
magnificent
a
fortune
had
simply
prompted
him
,
as
he
might
have
been
prompted
to
play
for
a
high
stake
at
a
gaming
-
table
.
<EOS>
But
now
,
during
these
moments
,
he
did
think
a
little
of
her
.
<EOS>
Would
she
be
happy
,
simply
because
he
loved
her
,
when
all
women
should
cease
to
acknowledge
her
;
when
men
would
regard
her
as
one
degraded
and
dishonoured
;
when
society
should
be
closed
against
her
;
when
she
would
be
driven
to
live
loudly
because
the
softness
and
graces
of
quiet
life
would
be
denied
to
her
?
<EOS>
Burgo
knew
well
what
must
be
the
nature
of
such
a
woman
's
life
in
such
circumstances
.
<EOS>
Would
Glencora
be
happy
with
him
while
living
such
a
life
simply
because
he
loved
her
?
<EOS>
And
,
under
such
circumstances
,
was
it
likely
that
he
would
continue
to
love
her
?
<EOS>
Did
he
not
know
himself
to
be
the
most
inconstant
of
men
,
and
the
least
trustworthy
?
<EOS>
Leaning
thus
against
the
wall
at
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
he
did
ask
himself
all
these
questions
with
something
of
true
feeling
about
his
heart
,
and
almost
persuaded
himself
that
he
had
better
take
his
hat
and
wander
forth
anywhere
into
the
streets
.
<EOS>
It
mattered
little
what
might
become
of
himself
.
<EOS>
If
he
could
drink
himself
out
of
the
world
,
it
might
be
an
end
of
things
that
would
be
not
altogether
undesirable
.
  
<EOS>
But
then
the
remembrance
of
his
aunt
's
two
hundred
pounds
came
upon
him
,
<EOS>
which
money
he
even
now
had
about
him
on
his
person
,
and
a
certain
idea
of
honour
told
him
that
he
was
bound
to
do
that
for
which
the
money
had
been
given
to
him
.
<EOS>
As
to
telling
his
aunt
that
he
had
changed
his
mind
,
and
,
therefore
,
refunding
the
money
 
<EOS>
no
such
thought
as
that
was
possible
to
him
!
<EOS>
To
give
back
two
hundred
pounds
entire
,
 
two
hundred
pounds
which
were
already
within
his
clutches
,
was
not
within
the
compass
of
Burgo
's
generosity
.
<EOS>
Remembering
the
cash
,
he
told
himself
that
hesitation
was
no
longer
possible
to
him
.
<EOS>
So
he
gathered
himself
up
,
stretched
his
hands
over
his
head
,
uttered
a
sigh
that
was
audible
to
all
around
him
,
and
took
himself
up
-
stairs
.
  
<EOS>
He
looked
in
at
his
aunt
's
room
,
and
then
he
saw
her
and
was
seen
by
her
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
Burgo
,
"
she
said
,
with
her
sweetest
smile
,
"
have
you
been
dancing
?
"
<EOS>
He
turned
away
from
her
without
answering
her
,
muttering
something
between
his
teeth
about
a
cold
-
blooded
Jezebel
,
 
which
,
if
she
had
heard
it
,
would
have
made
her
think
him
the
most
ungrateful
of
men
.
<EOS>
But
she
did
not
hear
him
,
and
smiled
still
as
he
went
away
,
saying
something
to
Mrs.
Conway
Sparkes
as
to
the
great
change
for
the
better
which
had
taken
place
in
her
nephew
's
conduct
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
no
knowing
who
may
not
reform
,
"
said
Mrs.
Sparkes
,
with
an
emphasis
which
seemed
to
Lady
Monk
to
be
almost
uncourteous
.
  
<EOS>
Burgo
made
his
way
first
into
the
front
room
and
then
into
the
larger
room
where
the
dancing
was
in
progress
,
and
there
he
saw
Lady
Glencora
standing
up
in
a
quadrille
with
the
Marquis
of
Hartletop
.
<EOS>
Lord
Hartletop
was
a
man
not
much
more
given
to
conversation
than
his
wife
,
and
Lady
Glencora
seemed
to
go
through
her
work
with
very
little
gratification
either
in
the
dancing
or
in
the
society
of
her
partner
.
<EOS>
She
was
simply
standing
up
to
dance
,
because
,
as
she
had
told
Mr.
Palliser
,
ladies
of
her
age
generally
do
stand
up
on
such
occasions
.
<EOS>
Burgo
watched
her
as
she
crossed
and
re
-
crossed
the
room
,
and
at
last
she
was
aware
of
his
presence
.
<EOS>
It
made
no
change
in
her
,
except
that
she
became
even
somewhat
less
animated
than
she
had
been
before
.
<EOS>
She
would
not
seem
to
see
him
,
nor
would
she
allow
herself
to
be
driven
into
a
pretence
of
a
conversation
with
her
partner
because
he
was
there
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
go
up
to
her
at
once
,
and
ask
her
to
waltz
,
"
Burgo
said
to
himself
,
as
soon
as
the
last
figure
of
the
quadrille
was
in
action
.
<EOS>
"
Why
should
I
not
ask
her
as
well
as
any
other
woman
?
"
<EOS>
Then
the
music
ceased
,
and
after
a
minute
's
interval
Lord
Hartletop
took
away
his
partner
on
his
arm
into
another
room
.
<EOS>
Burgo
,
who
had
been
standing
near
the
door
,
followed
them
at
once
.
<EOS>
The
crowd
was
great
,
so
that
he
could
not
get
near
them
or
even
keep
them
in
sight
,
but
he
was
aware
of
the
way
in
which
they
were
going
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
five
minutes
after
this
when
he
again
saw
her
,
and
then
she
was
seated
on
a
cane
bench
in
the
gallery
,
and
an
old
woman
was
standing
close
to
her
,
talking
to
her
.
<EOS>
It
was
Mrs.
Marsham
cautioning
her
against
some
petty
imprudence
,
and
Lady
Glencora
was
telling
that
lady
that
she
needed
no
such
advice
,
in
words
almost
as
curt
as
those
I
have
used
.
<EOS>
Lord
Hartletop
had
left
her
,
feeling
that
,
as
far
as
that
was
concerned
,
he
had
done
his
duty
for
the
night
.
<EOS>
Burgo
knew
nothing
of
Mrs.
Marsham
,
 
had
never
seen
her
before
,
and
was
quite
unaware
that
she
had
any
special
connection
with
Mr.
Palliser
.
<EOS>
It
was
impossible
,
he
thought
,
to
find
Lady
Glencora
in
a
better
position
for
his
purpose
,
so
he
made
his
way
up
to
her
through
the
crowd
,
and
muttering
some
slight
inaudible
word
,
offered
her
his
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
will
do
very
well
thank
you
,
Mrs.
Marsham
,
"
Lady
Glencora
said
at
this
moment
.
<EOS>
"
Pray
,
do
not
trouble
yourself
,
"
and
then
she
gave
her
hand
to
Fitzgerald
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Marsham
,
though
unknown
to
him
,
knew
with
quite
sufficient
accuracy
who
he
was
,
and
all
his
history
,
as
far
as
it
concerned
her
friend
's
wife
.
<EOS>
She
had
learned
the
whole
story
of
the
loves
of
Burgo
and
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
Though
Mr.
Palliser
had
never
mentioned
that
man
's
name
to
her
,
she
was
well
aware
that
her
duty
as
a
duenna
would
make
it
expedient
that
she
should
keep
a
doubly
wary
eye
upon
him
<EOS>
should
he
come
near
the
sheepfold
.
<EOS>
And
there
he
was
,
close
to
them
,
almost
leaning
over
them
,
with
the
hand
of
his
late
lady
love
,
 
the
hand
of
Mr.
Palliser
's
wife
,
 
within
his
own
!
<EOS>
How
Lady
Glencora
might
have
carried
herself
at
this
moment
had
Mrs.
Marsham
not
been
there
,
it
is
bootless
now
to
surmise
;
but
it
may
be
well
understood
that
under
Mrs.
Marsham
's
immediate
eye
all
her
resolution
would
be
in
Burgo
's
favour
.
<EOS>
She
looked
at
him
softly
and
kindly
,
and
though
she
uttered
no
articulate
word
,
her
countenance
seemed
to
show
that
the
meeting
was
not
unpleasant
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
waltz
?
<EOS>
"
said
Burgo
,
 
asking
it
not
at
all
as
though
it
were
a
special
favour
,
 
asking
it
exactly
as
he
might
have
done
<EOS>
had
they
been
in
the
habit
of
dancing
with
each
other
every
other
night
for
the
last
three
months
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
Lady
Glencora
will
waltz
to
-
night
,
"
said
Mrs.
Marsham
,
very
stiffly
.
<EOS>
She
certainly
did
not
know
her
business
as
a
duenna
,
or
else
the
enormity
of
Burgo
's
proposition
had
struck
her
so
forcibly
as
to
take
away
from
her
all
her
presence
of
mind
.
<EOS>
Otherwise
,
she
must
have
been
aware
that
such
an
answer
from
her
would
surely
drive
her
friend
's
wife
into
open
hostility
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
why
not
,
Mrs.
Marsham
?
"
said
Lady
Glencora
rising
from
her
seat
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Why
should
n't
I
waltz
to
-
night
?
<EOS>
I
rather
think
I
shall
,
the
more
especially
as
Mr.
Fitzgerald
waltzes
very
well
.
<EOS>
"
Thereupon
she
put
her
hand
upon
Burgo
's
arm
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Marsham
made
still
a
little
effort
,
 
a
little
effort
that
was
probably
involuntary
.
<EOS>
She
put
out
her
hand
,
and
laid
it
on
Lady
Glencora
's
left
shoulder
,
looking
into
her
face
as
she
did
so
with
all
the
severity
of
caution
of
which
she
was
mistress
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
shook
her
duenna
off
angrily
.
<EOS>
Whether
she
would
put
her
fate
into
the
hands
of
this
man
who
was
now
touching
her
,
or
whether
she
would
not
,
she
had
not
as
yet
decided
;
but
of
this
she
was
very
sure
,
that
nothing
said
or
done
by
Mrs.
Marsham
should
have
any
effect
in
restraining
her
.
  
<EOS>
What
could
Mrs.
Marsham
do
?
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
was
gone
.
<EOS>
Some
rumour
of
that
proposed
visit
to
Monkshade
,
and
the
way
in
which
it
had
been
prevented
,
had
reached
her
ear
.
<EOS>
Some
whispers
had
come
to
her
that
Fitzgerald
still
dared
to
love
,
as
married
,
the
woman
whom
he
had
loved
before
she
was
married
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
rumour
about
that
he
still
had
some
hope
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Marsham
had
never
believed
that
Mr.
Palliser
's
wife
would
really
be
false
to
her
vows
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
in
fear
of
any
such
catastrophe
as
a
positive
elopement
that
she
had
taken
upon
herself
the
duty
of
duenna
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
would
,
no
doubt
,
require
to
be
pressed
down
into
that
decent
mould
which
it
would
become
the
wife
of
a
Mr.
Palliser
to
assume
as
her
form
;
and
this
pressing
down
,
and
<EOS>
this
moulding
,
Mrs.
Marsham
thought
that
she
could
accomplish
.
<EOS>
It
had
not
hitherto
occurred
to
her
that
she
might
be
required
to
guard
Mr.
Palliser
from
positive
dishonour
;
but
now
 
now
she
hardly
knew
what
to
think
about
it
.
<EOS>
What
should
she
do
?
<EOS>
To
whom
should
she
go
?
<EOS>
And
then
she
saw
Mr.
Bott
looming
large
before
her
on
the
top
of
the
staircase
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
Lady
Glencora
went
off
towards
the
dancers
,
leaning
on
Burgo
's
arm
.
<EOS>
"
Who
is
that
woman
?
"
said
Burgo
.
<EOS>
They
were
the
first
words
he
spoke
to
her
,
though
since
he
had
last
seen
her
he
had
written
to
her
that
letter
which
even
now
she
carried
about
her
.
<EOS>
His
voice
in
her
ears
sounded
as
it
used
to
sound
when
their
intimacy
had
been
close
,
and
questions
such
as
that
he
had
asked
were
common
between
them
.
<EOS>
And
her
answer
was
of
the
same
nature
.
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
such
an
odious
woman
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
Her
name
is
Mrs.
Marsham
;
she
is
my
bête
noire
.
"
<EOS>
And
then
they
were
actually
dancing
,
whirling
round
the
room
together
,
before
a
word
had
been
said
of
that
which
was
Burgo
's
settled
purpose
,
and
which
at
some
moments
was
her
settled
purpose
also
.
  
<EOS>
Burgo
waltzed
excellently
,
and
in
old
days
,
before
her
marriage
,
Lady
Glencora
had
been
passionately
fond
of
dancing
.
<EOS>
She
seemed
to
give
herself
up
to
it
now
as
though
the
old
days
had
come
back
to
her
.
<EOS>
Lady
Monk
,
creeping
to
the
intermediate
door
between
her
den
and
the
dancing
-
room
,
looked
in
on
them
,
and
then
crept
back
again
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Marsham
and
Mr.
Bott
standing
together
just
inside
the
other
door
,
near
to
the
staircase
,
looked
on
also
 
in
horror
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
should
n't
have
gone
away
and
left
her
,
"
said
Mr.
Bott
,
almost
hoarsely
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
who
could
have
thought
it
?
"
said
Mrs.
Marsham
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
sure
I
did
n't
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
you
'd
better
tell
him
?
"
said
Mr.
Bott
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
do
n't
know
where
to
find
him
,
"
said
Mrs.
Marsham
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
mean
now
at
once
,
"
said
Mr.
Bott
;
 
and
then
he
added
,
"
Do
you
think
it
is
as
bad
as
that
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
what
to
think
,
"
said
Mrs.
Marsham
.
  
<EOS>
The
waltzers
went
on
till
they
were
stopped
by
want
of
breath
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
so
much
out
of
practice
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
;
"
I
did
n't
think
 
I
should
have
been
able
 
to
dance
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Then
she
put
up
her
face
,
and
slightly
opened
her
mouth
,
and
stretched
her
nostrils
,
 
as
ladies
do
as
well
as
horses
when
the
running
has
been
severe
and
they
want
air
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
'll
take
another
turn
,
"
said
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
Presently
,
"
said
she
,
beginning
to
have
some
thought
in
her
mind
as
to
whether
Mrs.
Marsham
was
watching
her
.
<EOS>
Then
there
was
a
little
pause
,
after
which
he
spoke
in
an
altered
voice
.
  
<EOS>
"
Does
it
put
you
in
mind
of
old
days
?
"
said
he
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
,
of
course
,
necessary
for
him
that
he
should
bring
her
to
some
thought
of
the
truth
.
<EOS>
It
was
all
very
sweet
,
that
dancing
with
her
,
as
they
used
to
dance
,
without
any
question
as
to
the
reason
why
it
was
so
;
that
sudden
falling
into
the
old
habits
,
as
though
everything
between
this
night
and
the
former
nights
had
been
a
dream
;
but
this
would
not
further
his
views
.
<EOS>
The
opportunity
had
come
to
him
which
he
must
use
,
if
he
intended
ever
to
use
such
opportunity
.
<EOS>
There
was
the
two
hundred
pounds
in
his
pocket
,
which
he
did
not
intend
to
give
back
.
<EOS>
"
Does
it
put
you
in
mind
of
"
old
days
?
"
<EOS>
"
he
said
.
  
<EOS>
The
words
roused
her
from
her
sleep
at
once
,
and
dissipated
her
dream
.
<EOS>
The
facts
all
rushed
upon
her
in
an
instant
;
the
letter
in
her
pocket
;
the
request
which
she
had
made
to
Alice
,
that
Alice
might
be
induced
to
guard
her
from
this
danger
;
the
words
which
her
husband
had
spoken
to
her
in
the
morning
,
and
her
anger
against
him
in
that
he
had
subjected
her
to
the
eyes
of
a
Mrs.
Marsham
;
her
own
unsettled
mind
 
quite
unsettled
whether
it
would
be
best
for
her
to
go
or
to
stay
!
<EOS>
It
all
came
upon
her
now
at
the
first
word
of
tenderness
which
Burgo
spoke
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
It
has
often
been
said
of
woman
that
she
who
doubts
is
lost
,
 
so
often
that
they
who
say
it
now
,
say
it
simply
because
others
have
said
it
before
them
,
never
thinking
whether
or
no
there
be
any
truth
in
the
proverb
.
<EOS>
But
they
who
have
said
so
,
thinking
of
their
words
as
they
were
uttered
,
have
known
but
little
of
women
.
<EOS>
Women
doubt
every
day
,
who
solve
their
doubts
at
last
on
the
right
side
,
driven
to
do
so
,
some
by
fear
,
more
by
conscience
,
but
most
of
them
by
that
half
-
prudential
,
half
-
unconscious
knowledge
of
what
is
fitting
,
useful
,
and
best
under
the
cirumstances
,
which
rarely
deserts
either
men
or
women
till
they
have
brought
themselves
to
the
Burgo
Fitzgerald
state
of
recklessness
.
<EOS>
Men
when
they
have
fallen
even
to
that
,
will
still
keep
up
some
outward
show
towards
the
world
;
but
women
in
this
condition
defy
the
world
,
and
declare
themselves
to
be
children
of
perdition
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
was
doubting
sorely
;
but
,
though
doubting
,
she
was
not
as
yet
lost
.
  
<EOS>
"
Does
it
put
you
in
mind
of
old
days
?
"
said
Burgo
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
driven
to
answer
,
and
she
knew
that
much
would
be
decided
by
the
way
in
which
she
might
now
speak
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
not
talk
of
that
,
"
she
said
,
very
softly
.
  
<EOS>
"
May
I
not
?
"
<EOS>
And
now
his
tongue
was
unloosed
,
so
that
he
began
to
speak
quickly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
May
I
not
?
<EOS>
And
why
not
?
<EOS>
They
were
happy
days
,
 
so
happy
!
<EOS>
Were
not
you
happy
when
you
thought
 
?
<EOS>
Ah
,
dear
!
<EOS>
I
suppose
it
is
best
not
even
to
think
of
them
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Much
the
best
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Only
it
is
impossible
.
<EOS>
I
wish
I
knew
the
inside
of
your
heart
,
Cora
,
so
that
I
could
see
what
it
is
that
you
really
wish
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
In
the
old
days
he
had
always
called
her
Cora
,
and
now
the
name
came
from
his
lips
upon
her
ears
as
a
thing
of
custom
,
causing
no
surprise
.
<EOS>
They
were
standing
back
,
behind
the
circle
,
almost
in
a
corner
,
and
Burgo
knew
well
how
to
speak
at
such
moments
so
that
his
words
should
be
audible
to
none
but
her
whom
he
addressed
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
should
not
have
come
to
me
at
all
,
"
she
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
why
not
?
<EOS>
Who
has
a
better
right
to
come
to
you
?
<EOS>
Who
has
ever
loved
you
as
I
have
done
?
<EOS>
Cora
,
did
you
get
my
letter
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Come
and
dance
<EOS>
,
"
she
said
;
"
I
see
a
pair
of
eyes
looking
at
us
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
pair
of
eyes
which
Lady
Glencora
saw
were
in
the
possession
of
Mr.
Bott
,
who
was
standing
alone
,
leaning
against
the
side
of
the
doorway
,
every
now
and
then
raising
his
heels
from
the
ground
,
so
that
he
might
look
down
upon
the
sinners
as
from
a
vantage
ground
.
<EOS>
He
was
quite
alone
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Marsham
had
left
him
,
and
had
gotten
herself
away
in
Lady
Glencora
's
own
carriage
to
Park
Lane
,
in
order
that
she
might
find
Mr.
Palliser
there
,
if
by
chance
he
should
be
at
home
.
  
<EOS>
"
Wo
n't
it
be
making
mischief
?
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Marsham
had
said
when
Mr.
Bott
had
suggested
this
line
of
conduct
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
'll
be
worse
mischief
if
you
do
n't
,
"
Mr.
Bott
had
answered
.
<EOS>
"
He
can
come
back
,
and
then
he
can
do
as
he
likes
.
<EOS>
I
'll
keep
my
eyes
upon
them
.
"
<EOS>
And
so
he
did
keep
his
eyes
upon
them
.
  
<EOS>
Again
they
went
round
the
room
,
 
or
that
small
portion
of
the
room
which
the
invading
crowd
had
left
to
the
dancers
,
 
as
though
they
were
enjoying
themselves
thoroughly
,
and
in
all
innocence
.
<EOS>
But
there
were
others
besides
Mr.
Bott
who
looked
on
and
wondered
.
<EOS>
The
Duchess
of
St.
Bungay
saw
it
,
and
shook
her
head
sorrowing
,
 
for
the
Duchess
was
good
at
heart
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Conway
Sparkes
saw
it
,
and
drank
it
down
with
keen
appetite
,
 
as
a
thirsty
man
with
a
longing
for
wine
will
drink
champagne
,
 
for
Mrs.
Conway
Sparkes
was
not
good
at
heart
.
<EOS>
Lady
Hartletop
saw
it
,
and
just
raised
her
eyebrows
.
<EOS>
It
was
nothing
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
liked
to
know
what
was
going
on
,
as
such
knowledge
was
sometimes
useful
;
but
,
as
for
heart
,
 
what
she
had
was
,
in
such
a
matter
,
neither
good
nor
bad
.
<EOS>
Her
blood
circulated
with
its
ordinary
precision
,
and
,
in
that
respect
,
no
woman
ever
had
a
better
heart
.
<EOS>
Lady
Monk
saw
it
,
and
a
frown
gathered
on
her
brow
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
fool
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
said
to
herself
.
<EOS>
She
knew
that
Burgo
would
not
help
his
success
by
drawing
down
the
eyes
of
all
her
guests
upon
his
attempt
.
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
Mr.
Bott
stood
there
,
mounting
still
higher
on
his
toes
,
straightening
his
back
against
the
wall
.
  
<EOS>
"
Did
you
get
my
letter
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Burgo
said
again
,
as
soon
as
a
moment
's
pause
gave
him
breath
to
speak
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
answer
him
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
her
breath
did
not
return
to
her
as
rapidly
as
his
.
<EOS>
But
,
of
course
,
he
knew
that
she
had
received
it
.
<EOS>
She
would
have
quickly
signified
to
him
that
no
letter
from
him
had
come
to
her
hands
had
it
not
reached
her
.
"
<EOS>
Let
us
go
out
upon
the
stairs
,
"
he
said
,
"
for
I
must
speak
to
you
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
if
you
could
know
what
I
suffered
when
you
did
not
come
to
Monkshade
!
<EOS>
Why
did
you
not
come
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
had
not
come
here
,
"
she
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
Because
you
have
seen
me
?
<EOS>
That
,
at
any
rate
,
is
not
kind
of
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
They
were
now
making
their
way
slowly
down
the
stairs
,
in
the
crowd
,
towards
the
supper
-
room
.
<EOS>
All
the
world
was
now
intent
on
food
and
drink
,
and
they
were
only
doing
as
others
did
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
was
not
thinking
where
she
went
,
but
,
glancing
upwards
,
as
she
stood
for
a
moment
wedged
upon
the
stairs
,
her
eyes
met
those
of
Mr.
Bott
.
<EOS>
"
A
man
that
can
treat
me
like
that
deserves
that
I
should
leave
him
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
That
was
the
thought
that
crossed
her
mind
at
the
moment
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
get
you
some
champagne
with
water
in
it
,
"
said
Burgo
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
that
is
what
you
like
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
not
get
me
anything
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
They
had
now
got
into
the
room
,
and
had
therefore
escaped
Mr.
Bott
's
eyes
for
the
moment
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Fitzgerald
,
"
 
and
now
her
words
had
become
a
whisper
in
his
ear
,
 
"
do
what
I
ask
you
.
<EOS>
For
the
sake
of
the
old
days
of
which
you
spoke
,
the
dear
old
days
which
can
never
come
again
 
"
  
"
By
G
 
---
!
<EOS>
they
can
,
"
said
he
.
<EOS>
"
They
can
come
back
,
and
they
shall
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Never
.
<EOS>
But
you
can
still
do
me
a
kindness
.
<EOS>
Go
away
,
and
leave
me
.
<EOS>
Go
to
the
sideboard
,
and
then
do
not
come
back
.
<EOS>
You
are
doing
me
an
injury
while
you
remain
with
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Cora
,
"
he
said
,
  
<EOS>
But
she
had
now
recovered
her
presence
of
mind
,
and
understood
what
was
going
on
.
<EOS>
She
was
no
longer
in
a
dream
,
but
words
and
things
bore
to
her
again
their
proper
meaning
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
have
it
,
Mr.
Fitzgerald
,
"
she
answered
,
speaking
almost
passionately
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
have
it
.
<EOS>
Do
as
I
bid
you
.
<EOS>
Go
and
leave
me
,
and
do
not
return
.
<EOS>
I
tell
you
that
we
are
watched
.
<EOS>
"
This
was
still
true
,
for
Mr.
Bott
had
now
again
got
his
eyes
on
them
,
round
the
supper
-
room
door
.
<EOS>
Whatever
was
the
reward
for
which
he
was
working
,
private
secretaryship
or
what
else
,
it
must
be
owned
that
he
worked
hard
for
it
.
<EOS>
But
there
are
labours
which
are
labours
of
love
.
  
<EOS>
"
Who
is
watching
us
?
"
said
Burgo
;
"
and
what
does
it
matter
?
<EOS>
If
you
are
minded
to
do
as
I
have
asked
you
 
"
  
"
<EOS>
But
I
am
not
so
minded
.
<EOS>
Do
you
not
know
that
you
insult
me
by
proposing
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
 
it
is
an
insult
,
Cora
,
 
unless
such
an
offer
be
a
joy
to
you
.
<EOS>
If
you
wish
to
be
my
wife
instead
of
his
,
it
is
no
insult
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
can
I
be
that
?
"
<EOS>
Her
face
was
not
turned
to
him
,
and
her
words
were
half
-
pronounced
,
and
in
the
lowest
whisper
,
but
,
nevertheless
,
he
heard
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
with
me
,
 
abroad
,
and
you
shall
yet
be
my
wife
.
<EOS>
You
got
my
letter
?
<EOS>
Do
what
I
asked
you
,
then
.
<EOS>
Come
with
me
 
to
-
night
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
pressing
instance
of
the
suggestion
,
the
fixing
of
a
present
hour
,
startled
her
back
to
her
propriety
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Fitzgerald
,
"
she
said
,
"
I
asked
you
to
go
and
leave
me
.
<EOS>
If
you
do
not
do
so
,
I
must
get
up
and
leave
you
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
much
more
difficult
.
"
  
"
And
is
that
to
be
all
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
All
;
 
at
any
rate
,
now
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
Glencora
!
<EOS>
how
could
you
be
so
weak
?
<EOS>
Why
did
you
add
that
word
,
"
now
"
?
<EOS>
In
truth
,
she
added
it
then
,
at
that
moment
,
simply
feeling
that
she
could
thus
best
secure
an
immediate
compliance
with
her
request
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
go
,
"
he
said
,
looking
at
her
sternly
,
and
leaning
before
her
,
with
earnest
face
,
with
utter
indifference
as
to
the
eyes
of
any
that
might
see
them
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
go
till
you
tell
me
that
you
will
see
me
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
,
"
she
said
in
that
low
,
all
-
but
-
unuttered
whisper
.
  
<EOS>
"
When
,
 
when
,
 
when
?
"
he
asked
.
  
<EOS>
Looking
up
again
towards
the
doorway
,
in
fear
of
Mr.
Bott
's
eyes
,
she
saw
the
face
of
Mr.
Palliser
as
he
entered
the
room
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bott
had
also
seen
him
,
and
had
tried
to
clutch
him
by
the
arm
;
but
Mr.
Palliser
had
shaken
him
off
,
apparently
with
indifference
,
 
had
got
rid
of
him
,
as
it
were
,
without
noticing
him
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
,
when
she
saw
her
husband
,
immediately
recovered
her
courage
.
<EOS>
She
would
not
cower
before
him
,
or
show
herself
ashamed
of
what
she
had
done
.
<EOS>
For
the
matter
of
that
,
if
he
pressed
her
on
the
subject
,
she
could
bring
herself
to
tell
him
that
she
loved
Burgo
Fitzgerald
much
more
easily
than
she
could
whisper
such
a
word
to
Burgo
himself
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bott
's
eyes
were
odious
to
her
as
they
watched
her
;
but
her
husband
's
glance
she
could
meet
without
quailing
before
it
.
<EOS>
"
Here
is
Mr.
Palliser
,
"
said
she
,
speaking
again
in
her
ordinary
clear
-
toned
voice
.
<EOS>
Burgo
immediately
rose
from
his
seat
with
a
start
,
and
turned
quickly
towards
the
door
;
but
Lady
Glencora
kept
her
chair
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
made
his
way
as
best
he
could
through
the
crowd
up
to
his
wife
.
<EOS>
He
,
too
,
kept
his
countenance
without
betraying
his
secret
.
<EOS>
There
was
neither
anger
nor
dismay
in
his
face
,
nor
was
there
any
untoward
hurry
in
his
movement
.
<EOS>
Burgo
stood
aside
as
he
came
up
,
and
Lady
Glencora
was
the
first
to
speak
.
<EOS>
"
I
thought
you
were
gone
home
hours
ago
,
"
she
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
go
home
,
"
he
answered
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
thought
I
might
as
well
come
back
for
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
a
model
of
a
husband
!
<EOS>
Well
;
I
am
ready
.
<EOS>
Only
,
what
shall
we
do
about
Jane
?
<EOS>
Mr.
Fitzgerald
,
I
left
a
scarf
in
your
aunt
's
room
,
 
a
little
black
and
yellow
scarf
,
 
would
you
mind
getting
it
for
me
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
fetch
it
,
"
said
Mr.
Palliser
;
"
and
I
will
tell
your
cousin
that
the
carriage
shall
come
back
for
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
will
allow
me
 
"
said
Burgo
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
do
it
,
"
said
Mr.
Palliser
;
and
away
he
went
,
making
his
slow
progress
up
through
the
crowd
,
ordering
his
carriage
as
he
passed
through
the
hall
,
and
leaving
Mr.
Bott
still
watching
at
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
resolved
that
she
would
say
nothing
to
Burgo
while
her
husband
was
gone
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
touch
of
chivalry
in
his
leaving
them
again
together
,
which
so
far
conquered
her
.
<EOS>
He
might
have
bade
her
<EOS>
leave
the
scarf
,
and
come
at
once
.
<EOS>
She
had
seen
,
moreover
,
that
he
had
not
spoken
to
Mr.
Bott
,
and
was
thankful
to
him
also
for
that
.
<EOS>
Burgo
also
seemed
to
have
become
aware
that
his
chance
for
that
time
was
over
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
say
good
-
night
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
Good
-
night
,
Mr.
Fitzgerald
,
"
she
answered
,
giving
him
her
hand
.
<EOS>
He
pressed
it
for
a
moment
,
and
then
turned
and
went
.
<EOS>
When
Mr.
Palliser
came
back
he
was
no
more
to
be
seen
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
was
at
the
dining
-
room
door
when
her
husband
returned
,
standing
close
to
Mr.
Bott
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bott
had
spoken
to
her
,
but
she
made
no
reply
.
<EOS>
He
spoke
again
,
but
her
face
remained
as
immovable
as
though
she
had
been
deaf
.
"
<EOS>
And
what
shall
we
do
about
Mrs.
Marsham
?
<EOS>
"
she
said
,
quite
out
loud
,
as
soon
as
she
put
her
hand
on
her
husband
's
arm
.
<EOS>
"
I
had
forgotten
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Marsham
has
gone
home
,
"
he
replied
.
  
<EOS>
"
Have
you
seen
her
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
When
did
you
see
her
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
came
to
Park

What
made
her
do
that
?
"
  
<EOS>
These
questions
were
asked
and
answered
as
he
was
putting
her
into
the
carriage
.
<EOS>
She
got
in
just
as
she
asked
the
last
,
and
<EOS>
he
,
as
he
took
his
seat
,
did
not
find
it
necessary
to
answer
it
.
<EOS>
But
that
would
not
serve
her
turn
.
<EOS>
"
What
made
Mrs.
Marsham
go
to
you
at
Park
Lane
after
she
left
Lady
Monk
's
?
"
she
asked
again
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
sat
silent
,
not
having
made
up
his
mind
what
he
would
say
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
she
went
,
"
continued
Lady
Glencora
,
"
to
tell
you
that
I
was
dancing
with
Mr.
Fitzgerald
.
<EOS>
Was
that
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
Glencora
,
we
had
better
not
discuss
it
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
mean
to
discuss
it
now
,
or
ever
.
<EOS>
If
you
did
not
wish
me
to
see
Mr.
Fitzgerald
you
should
not
have
sent
me
to
Lady
Monk
's
.
<EOS>
But
,
Plantagenet
,
I
hope
you
will
forgive
me
if
I
say
that
no
consideration
shall
induce
me
to
receive
again
as
a
guest
,
in
my
own
house
,
either
Mrs.
Marsham
or
Mr.
Bott
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
absolutely
declined
to
say
anything
on
the
subject
on
that
occasion
,
and
the
evening
of
Lady
Monk
's
party
in
this
way
came
to
an
end
.

George
Vavasor
was
not
in
a
very
happy
mood
when
he
left
Queen
Anne
Street
,
after
having
flung
his
gift
ring
under
the
grate
.
<EOS>
Indeed
there
was
much
in
his
condition
,
as
connected
with
the
house
which
he
was
leaving
,
which
could
not
but
make
him
unhappy
.
<EOS>
Alice
was
engaged
to
be
his
wife
,
and
had
as
yet
said
nothing
to
show
that
she
meditated
any
breach
of
that
engagement
,
but
she
had
treated
him
in
a
way
which
made
him
long
to
throw
her
promise
in
her
teeth
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
man
to
whom
any
personal
slight
from
a
woman
was
unendurable
.
<EOS>
To
slights
from
men
,
unless
they
were
of
a
nature
to
provoke
offence
,
he
was
indifferent
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
man
living
for
whose
liking
or
disliking
George
Vavasor
cared
anything
.
<EOS>
But
he
did
care
much
for
the
good
opinion
,
or
rather
for
the
personal
favour
,
of
any
woman
to
whom
he
had
endeavoured
to
make
himself
agreeable
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
marry
you
,
"
Alice
had
said
to
him
,
 
not
in
words
,
but
in
acts
and
looks
,
which
were
plainer
than
words
,
 
"
I
will
marry
you
for
certain
reasons
of
my
own
,
which
in
my
present
condition
make
it
seem
that
that
arrangement
will
be
more
convenient
to
me
than
any
other
that
I
can
make
;
but
pray
understand
that
there
is
no
love
mixed
up
with
this
.
<EOS>
There
is
another
man
whom
I
love
;
 
only
,
for
those
reasons
above
hinted
<EOS>
,
I
do
not
care
to
marry
him
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
thus
that
he
read
Alice
's
present
treatment
of
him
,
and
he
was
a
man
who
could
not
endure
this
treatment
with
ease
.
  
<EOS>
But
though
he
could
throw
his
ring
under
the
grate
in
his
passion
,
he
could
not
so
dispose
of
her
.
<EOS>
That
he
would
have
done
<EOS>
so
had
his
hands
been
free
<EOS>
,
we
need
not
doubt
.
<EOS>
And
he
would
have
been
clever
enough
to
do
so
in
some
manner
that
would
have
been
exquisitely
painful
to
Alice
,
willing
as
she
might
be
to
be
released
from
her
engagement
.
<EOS>
But
he
could
not
do
this
to
a
woman
whose
money
he
had
borrowed
,
and
whose
money
he
could
not
repay
;
 
to
a
woman
,
more
of
whose
money
he
intended
to
borrow
immediately
.
<EOS>
As
to
that
latter
part
of
it
,
he
did
say
to
himself
over
and
over
again
,
that
he
would
have
no
more
of
it
.
<EOS>
As
he
left
the
house
in
Queen
Anne
Street
,
on
that
occasion
,
he
swore
,
that
under
no
circumstances
would
he
be
indebted
to
her
for
another
shilling
.
<EOS>
But
before
he
had
reached
Great
Marlborough
Street
,
to
which
his
steps
took
him
,
he
had
reminded
himself
that
everything
depended
on
a
further
advance
.
<EOS>
He
was
in
Parliament
,
but
Parliament
would
be
dissolved
within
three
months
.
<EOS>
Having
sacrificed
so
much
for
his
position
,
should
he
let
it
all
fall
from
him
now
,
 
now
,
when
success
seemed
to
be
within
his
reach
?
<EOS>
That
wretched
old
man
in
Westmoreland
,
who
seemed
gifted
almost
with
immortality
,
 
<EOS>
why
could
he
not
die
and
surrender
his
paltry
acres
to
one
who
could
use
them
?
<EOS>
He
turned
away
from
Regent
Street
into
Hanover
Square
before
he
crossed
to
Great
Marlborough
Street
,
giving
vent
to
his
passion
rather
than
arranging
his
thoughts
.
<EOS>
As
he
walked
the
four
sides
of
the
square
he
considered
how
good
it
would
be
if
some
accident
should
befall
the
old
man
.
<EOS>
How
he
would
rejoice
were
he
to
hear
to
-
morrow
that
one
of
the
trees
of
the
"
accursed
place
,
"
had
fallen
on
the
"
obstinate
old
idiot
,
"
and
put
an
end
to
him
!
<EOS>
I
will
not
say
that
he
meditated
the
murder
of
his
grandfather
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
firm
conviction
on
his
mind
,
as
he
thought
of
all
this
,
that
such
a
deed
as
that
would
never
come
in
his
way
.
<EOS>
But
he
told
himself
,
that
if
he
chose
to
make
the
attempt
,
he
would
certainly
be
able
to
carry
it
through
without
detection
.
<EOS>
Then
he
remembered
Rush
and
Palmer
 
the
openly
bold
murderer
and
the
secret
poisoner
.
<EOS>
Both
of
them
,
in
Vavasor
's
estimation
,
were
great
men
.
<EOS>
He
had
often
said
so
in
company
.
<EOS>
He
had
declared
that
the
courage
of
Rush
had
never
been
surpassed
.
"
<EOS>
Think
of
him
,
"
he
would
say
with
admiration
,
"
walking
into
a
man
's
house
,
with
pistols
sufficient
to
shoot
every
one
there
,
and
doing
it
as
though
he
were
killing
rats
!
<EOS>
What
was
Nelson
at
Trafalgar
to
that
?
<EOS>
Nelson
had
nothing
to
fear
!
"
<EOS>
And
of
Palmer
he
declared
that
he
was
a
man
of
genius
as
well
as
courage
.
<EOS>
He
had
"
looked
the
whole
thing
in
the
face
,
"
Vavasor
would
say
,
"
and
told
himself
that
all
scruples
and
squeamishness
are
bosh
,
 
child
's
tales
.
<EOS>
And
so
they
are
.
<EOS>
Who
lives
as
though
they
fear
either
heaven
or
hell
?
<EOS>
And
if
we
do
live
without
such
fear
or
respect
,
what
is
the
use
of
telling
lies
to
ourselves
?
<EOS>
To
throw
it
all
to
the
dogs
,
as
Palmer
did
,
is
more
manly
.
"
<EOS>
"
And
be
hanged
,
"
some
hearer
of
George
's
doctrine
replied
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
and
be
hanged
,
 
if
such
is
your
destiny
.
<EOS>
But
you
hear
of
the
one
who
is
hanged
,
but
hear
nothing
of
the
twenty
who
are
not
.
"
  
<EOS>
Vavasor
walked
round
Hanover
Square
,
nursing
his
hatred
against
the
old
Squire
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
tell
himself
that
he
would
like
to
murder
his
grandfather
.
<EOS>
But
he
suggested
to
himself
,
that
if
he
desired
to
do
so
,
he
would
have
courage
enough
to
make
his
way
into
the
old
man
's
room
,
and
strangle
him
;
and
he
explained
to
himself
how
he
would
be
able
to
get
down
into
Westmoreland
without
the
world
knowing
that
he
had
been
there
,
 
how
he
would
find
an
entrance
into
the
house
by
a
window
with
which
he
was
acquainted
,
 
how
he
could
cause
the
man
to
die
as
though
,
those
around
him
should
think
,
it
was
apoplexy
,
 
<EOS>
he
,
George
Vavasor
,
having
read
something
on
that
subject
lately
.
<EOS>
All
this
he
considered
very
fully
,
walking
rapidly
round
Hanover
Square
more
than
once
or
twice
.
<EOS>
If
he
were
to
become
an
active
student
in
the
Rush
or
Palmer
school
,
he
would
so
study
the
matter
that
he
would
not
be
the
one
that
should
be
hung
.
<EOS>
He
thought
that
he
could
,
so
far
,
trust
his
own
ingenuity
.
<EOS>
But
yet
he
did
not
meditate
murder
.
"
<EOS>
Beastly
old
idiot
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
said
to
himself
,
"
he
must
have
his
chance
as
other
men
have
,
I
suppose
,
"
<EOS>
And
then
he
went
across
Regent
Street
to
Mr.
Scruby
's
office
in
Great
Marlborough
Street
,
not
having
,
as
yet
,
come
to
any
positive
conclusion
as
to
what
he
would
do
in
reference
to
Alice
's
money
.
  
<EOS>
But
he
soon
found
himself
talking
to
Mr.
Scruby
as
though
there
were
no
doubts
as
to
the
forthcoming
funds
for
the
next
elections
.
<EOS>
And
Mr.
Scruby
talked
to
him
very
plainly
,
as
though
those
funds
must
be
forthcoming
before
long
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
stitch
in
time
saves
nine
,
"
said
Mr.
Scruby
,
meaning
to
insinuate
that
a
pound
in
time
might
have
the
same
effect
.
<EOS>
"
And
I
'll
tell
you
what
,
Mr.
Vavasor
,
 
<EOS>
of
course
I
've
my
outstanding
bills
for
the
last
affair
.
<EOS>
That
's
no
fault
of
yours
,
for
the
things
came
so
sharp
one
on
another
that
my
fellows
have
n't
had
time
to
make
it
out
.
<EOS>
But
if
you
'll
put
me
in
funds
for
what
I
must
be
out
of
pocket
in
June
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
Will
it
be
so
soon
as
June
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
are
talking
of
June
.
<EOS>
Why
,
then
,
I
'll
lump
the
two
bills
together
when
it
's
all
over
.
"
  
<EOS>
In
their
discussion
respecting
money
Mr.
Scruby
injudiciously
mentioned
the
name
of
Mr.
Tombe
.
<EOS>
No
precise
caution
had
been
given
to
him
,
but
he
had
become
aware
that
the
matter
was
being
managed
through
an
agency
that
was
not
recognized
by
his
client
;
and
as
that
agency
was
simply
a
vehicle
of
money
which
found
its
way
into
Mr.
Scruby
's
pocket
,
he
should
have
held
his
tongue
.
<EOS>
But
Mr.
Tombe
's
name
escaped
from
him
,
and
Vavasor
immediately
questioned
him
.
<EOS>
Scruby
,
who
did
not
often
make
such
blunders
,
readily
excused
himself
,
shaking
his
head
,
and
declaring
that
the
name
had
fallen
from
his
lips
instead
of
that
of
another
man
.
<EOS>
Vavasor
accepted
the
excuse
without
further
notice
,
and
nothing
more
was
said
about
Mr.
Tombe
while
he
was
in
Mr.
Scruby
's
office
.
<EOS>
But
he
had
not
heard
the
name
in
vain
,
and
had
unfortunately
heard
it
before
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Tombe
was
a
remarkable
man
in
his
way
.
<EOS>
He
wore
powder
to
his
hair
,
 
was
very
polite
in
his
bearing
,
 
was
somewhat
asthmatic
,
and
wheezed
in
his
talking
,
 
and
was
,
moreover
,
the
most
obedient
of
men
,
though
it
was
said
of
him
that
he
managed
the
whole
income
of
the
Ely
Chapter
just
as
he
pleased
.
<EOS>
Being
in
these
ways
a
man
of
note
,
John
Grey
had
spoken
of
him
to
Alice
,
and
his
name
had
filtered
through
Alice
and
her
cousin
Kate
to
George
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
George
seldom
forgot
things
or
names
,
and
when
he
heard
Mr.
Tombe
's
name
mentioned
in
connection
with
his
own
money
matters
,
he
remembered
that
Mr.
Tombe
was
John
Grey
's
lawyer
.
  
<EOS>
As
soon
as
he
could
escape
out
into
the
street
he
endeavoured
to
put
all
these
things
together
,
and
after
a
while
resolved
that
he
would
go
to
Mr.
Tombe
.
<EOS>
What
if
there
should
be
an
understanding
between
John
Grey
and
Alice
,
and
Mr.
Tombe
should
be
arranging
his
money
matters
for
him
!
<EOS>
Would
not
anything
be
better
than
this
,
 
even
that
little
tragedy
down
in
Westmoreland
,
for
which
his
ingenuity
and
courage
would
be
required
?
<EOS>
He
could
endure
to
borrow
money
from
Alice
.
<EOS>
He
might
even
endure
it
still
,
 
though
that
was
very
difficult
after
her
treatment
of
him
;
but
he
could
not
endure
to
be
the
recipient
of
John
Grey
's
money
.
<EOS>
By
heavens
,
no
!
<EOS>
And
as
he
got
into
a
cab
,
and
had
himself
driven
off
to
the
neighbourhood
of
Doctors
"
Commons
,
he
gave
himself
credit
for
much
fine
manly
feeling
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Tombe
's
chambers
were
found
without
difficulty
,
and
,
as
it
happened
,
Mr.
Tombe
was
there
.
  
<EOS>
The
lawyer
rose
from
his
chair
as
Vavasor
entered
,
and
bowed
his
powdered
head
very
meekly
as
he
asked
his
visitor
to
sit
down
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Vavasor
;
 
<EOS>
oh
,
yes
.
<EOS>
He
had
heard
the
name
.
<EOS>
Yes
;
he
was
in
the
habit
of
acting
for
his
very
old
friend
Mr.
John
Grey
.
<EOS>
He
had
acted
for
Mr.
John
Grey
,
and
for
Mr.
John
Grey
's
father
,
 
he
or
his
partner
,
 
he
believed
he
might
say
,
for
about
half
a
century
.
<EOS>
There
could
not
be
a
nicer
gentleman
than
Mr.
John
Grey
;
 
and
such
a
pretty
child
as
he
used
to
be
!
"
<EOS>
At
every
new
sentence
Mr.
Tombe
caught
his
poor
asthmatic
breath
,
and
bowed
his
meek
old
head
,
and
rubbed
his
hands
together
as
though
he
hardly
dared
to
keep
his
seat
in
Vavasor
's
presence
without
the
support
of
some
such
motion
;
and
wheezed
apologetically
,
and
seemed
to
ask
pardon
of
his
visitor
for
not
knowing
intuitively
what
was
the
nature
of
that
visitor
's
business
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
a
sly
old
fox
was
Mr.
Tombe
,
and
was
considering
all
this
time
how
much
it
would
be
well
that
he
should
tell
Mr.
Vavasor
,
and
how
much
it
would
be
well
that
he
should
conceal
.
<EOS>
"
The
fat
had
got
into
the
fire
,
"
as
he
told
his
old
wife
when
he
got
home
that
evening
.
<EOS>
He
told
his
old
wife
everything
,
and
I
do
n't
know
that
any
of
his
clients
were
the
worse
for
his
doing
so
.
<EOS>
But
while
he
was
wheezing
,
and
coughing
,
and
apologizing
,
he
made
up
his
mind
that
if
George
Vavasor
were
to
ask
him
certain
questions
,
it
would
be
best
that
he
should
answer
them
truly
.
<EOS>
If
Vavasor
did
ask
those
questions
,
he
would
probably
do
so
upon
certain
knowledge
,
and
if
so
,
why
,
in
that
case
,
lying
would
be
of
no
use
.
<EOS>
Lying
would
not
put
the
fat
back
into
the
frying
pan
.
<EOS>
And
even
though
such
questions
might
be
asked
without
any
absolute
knowledge
,
they
would
,
at
any
rate
,
show
that
the
questioner
had
the
means
of
ascertaining
the
truth
.
<EOS>
He
would
tell
as
little
as
he
could
;
but
he
decided
during
his
last
wheeze
,
that
he
could
not
lie
in
the
matter
with
any
chance
of
benefiting
his
client
.
"
<EOS>
The
prettiest
child
I
ever
saw
,
Mr.
Vavasor
!
"
said
Mr.
Tombe
,
and
then
he
coughed
violently
.
<EOS>
Some
people
who
knew
Mr.
Tombe
declared
that
he
nursed
his
cough
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
dare
say
,
"
said
George
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
indeed
,
 
ugh
 
ugh
 
ugh
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Can
you
tell
me
,
Mr.
Tombe
,
whether
either
you
or
he
have
anything
to
do
with
the
payment
of
certain
sums
to
my
credit
at
Messrs.
Hock
and
Block
's
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Messrs.
Hock
and
Block
's
,
the
bankers
,
 
in
Lom
 
bard
Street
?
"
said
Mr.
Tombe
,
taking
a
little
more
time
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
;
I
bank
there
,
"
said
Vavasor
,
sharply
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
most
respectable
house
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Has
any
money
been
paid
there
to
my
credit
,
by
you
,
Mr.
Tombe
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
May
I
ask
you
why
you
put
the
question
to
me
,
Mr.
Vavasor
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
do
n't
think
you
may
.
<EOS>
That
is
to
say
,
my
reason
for
asking
it
can
have
nothing
to
do
with
yours
for
replying
to
it
.
<EOS>
If
you
have
had
no
hand
in
any
such
payment
,
there
is
an
end
of
it
,
and
I
need
not
take
up
your
time
by
saying
anything
more
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
prepared
to
go
that
length
,
Mr.
Vavasor
,
 
not
altogether
to
go
that
length
,
 
ugh
 
<EOS>
ugh
 
<EOS>
ugh
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
,
will
you
tell
me
what
you
have
done
in
the
matter
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
 
upon
my
word
,
you
've
taken
me
a
little
by
surprise
.
<EOS>
Let
me
see
.
<EOS>
Pinkle
,
 
Pinkle
.
<EOS>
"
Pinkle
was
a
clerk
who
sat
in
an
inner
room
,
and
Mr.
Tombe
's
effort
to
call
him
seemed
to
be
most
ineffectual
.
<EOS>
But
Pinkle
understood
the
sound
,
and
came
.
<EOS>
"
Pinkle
,
did
n't
we
pay
some
money
into
Hock
and
Block
's
a
few
weeks
since
,
to
the
credit
of
Mr.
George
Vavasor
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
we
,
sir
?
"
said
Pinkle
,
who
probably
knew
that
his
employer
was
an
old
fox
,
and
who
,
perhaps
,
had
caught
something
of
the
fox
nature
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
we
did
.
<EOS>
Just
look
Pinkle
;
 
and
,
Pinkle
,
 
<EOS>
see
the
date
,
and
let
me
know
all
about
it
.
<EOS>
It
's
fine
bright
weather
for
this
time
of
year
,
Mr.
Vavasor
;
but
these
easterly
winds
!
 
<EOS>
ugh
 
<EOS>
ugh
 
<EOS>
ugh
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Vavasor
found
himself
sitting
for
an
apparently
interminable
number
of
minutes
in
Mr.
Tombe
's
dingy
chamber
,
and
was
coughed
at
,
and
wheezed
at
,
till
he
begun
to
be
tired
of
his
position
;
moreover
,
when
tired
,
he
showed
his
impatience
.
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
you
'll
let
us
write
you
a
line
when
we
have
looked
into
the
matter
?
"
suggested
Mr.
Tombe
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'd
rather
know
at
once
,
"
said
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
suppose
it
can
take
you
very
long
to
find
out
whether
you
have
paid
money
to
my
account
,
by
order
of
Mr.
Grey
.
<EOS>
At
any
rate
,
I
must
know
before
I
go
away
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Pinkle
,
Pinkle
!
"
screamed
the
old
man
through
his
coughing
;
and
again
Pinkle
came
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
Pinkle
,
was
anything
of
the
kind
done
,
or
is
my
memory
deceiving
me
?
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Tombe
was
,
no
doubt
,
lying
shamefully
,
for
,
of
course
,
he
remembered
all
about
it
;
and
,
indeed
,
George
Vavasor
had
learned
already
quite
enough
for
his
own
purposes
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
going
to
look
,
"
said
Pinkle
;
and
Pinkle
again
went
away
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
sorry
to
give
your
clerk
so
much
trouble
,
"
said
Vavasor
,
in
an
angry
voice
;
"
<EOS>
and
I
think
it
must
be
unnecessary
.
<EOS>
Surely
you
know
whether
Mr.
Grey
has
commissioned
you
to
pay
money
for
me
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
have
so
many
things
to
do
,
Mr.
Vavasor
;
and
so
many
clients
.
<EOS>
We
have
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
You
see
,
it
is
n't
only
one
gentleman
's
affairs
.
<EOS>
But
I
think
there
was
something
done
.
<EOS>
I
do
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
Mr.
John
Grey
's
address
?
"
asked
Vavasor
,
very
sharply
.
  
<EOS>
"
Number
5
,
Suffolk
Street
,
Pall
Mall
East
,
"
said
Mr.
Tombe
.
<EOS>
Herein
Mr.
Tombe
somewhat
committed
himself
.
<EOS>
His
client
,
Mr.
Grey
,
was
,
in
fact
,
in
town
,
but
Vavasor
had
not
known
or
imagined
that
such
was
the
case
.
<EOS>
Had
Mr.
Tombe
given
the
usual
address
of
Nethercoats
,
nothing
further
would
have
been
demanded
from
him
on
that
subject
.
<EOS>
But
he
had
foolishly
presumed
that
the
question
had
been
based
on
special
information
as
to
his
client
's
visit
to
London
,
and
he
had
told
the
plain
truth
in
a
very
simple
way
.
  
<EOS>
"
Number
5
,
Suffolk
Street
,
"
said
Vavasor
,
writing
down
the
address
.
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
it
will
be
better
that
I
should
go
to
him
,
as
you
do
not
seem
inclined
to
give
me
any
information
.
"
<EOS>
Then
he
took
up
his
hat
,
and
hardly
bowing
to
Mr.
Tombe
,
left
the
chambers
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Tombe
,
as
he
did
so
,
rose
from
his
chair
,
and
bent
his
head
meekly
down
upon
the
table
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pinkle
,
Pinkle
,
"
wheezed
Mr.
Tombe
.
<EOS>
"
Never
mind
;
never
mind
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Pinkle
did
n't
mind
;
and
we
may
say
that
he
had
not
minded
;
for
up
to
that
moment
he
had
taken
no
steps
towards
a
performance
of
the
order
which
had
been
given
him
.
   
<EOS>
What
Occurred
in
Suffolk
Street
,
Pall
Mall
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Tombe
had
gained
nothing
for
the
cause
by
his
crafty
silence
.
<EOS>
George
Vavasor
felt
perfectly
certain
,
as
he
walked
out
from
the
little
street
which
runs
at
the
back
of
Doctors
"
Commons
,
that
the
money
which
he
had
been
using
had
come
,
in
some
shape
,
through
the
hands
of
John
Grey
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
care
much
to
calculate
whether
the
payments
had
been
made
from
the
personal
funds
of
his
rival
,
or
whether
that
rival
had
been
employed
to
dispense
Alice
's
fortune
.
<EOS>
Under
either
view
of
the
case
his
position
was
sufficiently
bitter
.
<EOS>
The
truth
never
for
a
moment
occurred
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
never
dreamed
that
there
might
be
a
conspiracy
in
the
matter
,
of
which
Alice
was
as
ignorant
as
he
himself
had
been
.
<EOS>
He
never
reflected
that
his
uncle
John
,
together
with
John
,
the
lover
,
whom
he
so
hated
,
might
be
the
conspirators
.
<EOS>
To
him
it
seemed
to
be
certain
that
Alice
and
Mr.
Grey
were
in
league
;
 
and
if
they
were
in
league
,
what
must
he
think
of
Alice
,
and
of
her
engagement
with
himself
!
  
<EOS>
There
are
men
who
rarely
think
well
of
women
,
 
who
hardly
think
well
of
any
woman
.
<EOS>
They
put
their
mothers
and
sisters
into
the
background
,
 
as
though
they
belonged
to
some
sex
or
race
apart
,
 
and
then
declare
to
themselves
and
to
their
friends
that
all
women
are
false
,
 
that
no
woman
can
be
trusted
unless
her
ugliness
protect
her
;
and
that
every
woman
may
be
attacked
as
fairly
as
may
game
in
a
cover
,
or
deer
on
a
mountain
,
What
man
does
not
know
men
who
have
so
thought
?
<EOS>
I
can
not
say
that
such
had
been
Vavasor
's
creed
,
 
not
entirely
such
.
<EOS>
There
had
been
periods
of
his
life
when
he
had
believed
implicitly
in
his
cousin
Alice
;
 
but
then
there
had
been
other
moments
in
which
he
had
ridiculed
himself
for
his
Quixotism
in
believing
in
any
woman
.
<EOS>
And
as
he
had
grown
older
the
moments
of
his
Quixotism
had
become
more
rare
.
<EOS>
There
would
have
been
no
such
Quixotism
left
with
him
now
,
had
not
the
various
circumstances
which
I
have
attempted
to
describe
,
filled
him
,
during
the
last
twelve
months
,
with
a
renewed
desire
to
marry
his
cousin
.
<EOS>
Every
man
tries
to
believe
in
the
honesty
of
his
future
wife
;
and
,
therefore
,
Vavasor
had
tried
,
and
had
in
his
way
,
believed
.
<EOS>
He
had
flattered
himself
,
too
,
that
Alice
's
heart
had
,
in
truth
,
been
more
prone
to
him
than
to
that
other
suitor
.
<EOS>
Grey
,
as
he
thought
,
had
been
accepted
by
her
cold
prudence
;
but
he
thought
,
also
,
that
she
had
found
her
prudence
to
be
too
cold
,
and
had
therefore
returned
where
she
had
truly
loved
.
<EOS>
Vavasor
,
though
he
did
not
love
much
himself
,
was
willing
enough
to
be
the
object
of
love
.
  
<EOS>
This
idea
of
his
,
however
,
had
been
greatly
shaken
by
Alice
's
treatment
of
himself
personally
;
but
still
he
had
not
,
hitherto
,
believed
that
she
was
false
to
him
.
<EOS>
Now
,
what
could
he
believe
of
her
?
<EOS>
What
was
there
within
the
compass
of
such
a
one
to
believe
?
<EOS>
As
he
walked
out
into
St.
Paul
's
Churchyard
he
called
her
by
every
name
which
is
most
offensive
to
a
woman
's
ears
.
<EOS>
He
hated
her
at
this
moment
with
even
a
more
bitter
hatred
than
that
which
he
felt
towards
John
Grey
.
<EOS>
She
must
have
deceived
him
with
unparalleled
hypocrisy
,
and
lied
to
him
and
to
his
sister
Kate
as
hardly
any
woman
had
ever
lied
before
.
<EOS>
Or
could
it
be
that
Kate
,
also
,
was
lying
to
him
?
<EOS>
If
so
,
Kate
also
should
be
included
in
the
punishment
.
  
<EOS>
But
why
should
they
have
conspired
to
feed
him
with
these
moneys
?
<EOS>
There
had
been
no
deceit
,
at
any
rate
,
in
reference
to
the
pounds
sterling
which
Scruby
had
already
swallowed
.
<EOS>
They
had
been
supplied
,
whatever
had
been
the
motives
of
the
suppliers
;
and
he
had
no
doubt
that
more
would
be
supplied
if
he
would
only
keep
himself
quiet
.
<EOS>
He
was
still
walking
westward
as
he
thought
of
this
,
down
Ludgate
Hill
,
on
his
direct
line
towards
Suffolk
Street
;
and
he
tried
to
persuade
himself
that
it
would
be
well
that
he
should
hide
his
wrath
till
after
provision
should
have
been
made
for
this
other
election
.
<EOS>
They
were
his
enemies
,
 
Alice
and
Mr.
Grey
,
 
and
why
should
he
keep
any
terms
with
his
enemies
?
<EOS>
It
was
still
a
trouble
to
him
to
think
that
he
should
have
been
in
any
way
beholden
to
John
Grey
;
but
the
terrible
thing
had
been
done
,
the
evil
had
occurred
.
<EOS>
What
would
he
gain
by
staying
his
hand
now
?
<EOS>
Still
,
however
,
he
walked
on
quickly
along
Fleet
Street
,
and
along
the
Strand
,
and
was
already
crossing
under
the
Picture
Galleries
towards
Pall
Mall
East
before
he
had
definitely
decided
what
steps
he
would
take
on
this
very
day
.
<EOS>
Exactly
at
the
corner
of
Suffolk
Street
he
met
John
Grey
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Grey
,
"
he
said
,
stopping
himself
suddenly
,
"
I
was
this
moment
going
to
call
on
you
at
your
lodgings
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
At
my
lodgings
,
were
you
?
<EOS>
Shall
I
return
with
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
please
,
"
said
Vavasor
,
leading
the
way
up
Suffolk
Street
.
<EOS>
There
had
been
no
other
greeting
than
this
between
them
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Grey
himself
,
though
a
man
very
courteous
in
his
general
demeanour
,
would
probably
have
passed
Vavasor
in
the
street
with
no
more
than
the
barest
salutation
.
<EOS>
Situated
as
they
were
towards
each
other
there
could
hardly
be
any
show
of
friendship
between
them
;
but
when
Vavasor
had
spoken
to
him
,
he
had
dressed
his
face
in
that
guise
of
civility
which
men
always
use
who
do
not
intend
to
be
offensive
;
 
but
Vavasor
dressed
his
as
men
dress
theirs
who
do
mean
to
be
offensive
;
and
Mr.
Grey
had
thoroughly
appreciated
the
dressing
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
will
allow
me
,
I
have
the
key
,
"
said
Grey
.
<EOS>
Then
they
both
entered
the
house
,
and
Vavasor
followed
his
host
up
-
stairs
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Grey
,
as
he
went
up
,
felt
almost
angry
with
himself
in
having
admitted
his
enemy
into
his
lodgings
.
<EOS>
He
was
sure
that
no
good
could
come
of
it
,
and
remembered
,
when
it
was
too
late
,
that
he
might
easily
have
saved
himself
from
giving
the
invitation
while
he
was
still
in
the
street
.
<EOS>
There
they
were
,
however
,
together
in
the
sitting
-
room
,
and
Grey
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
listen
.
<EOS>
"
Will
you
take
a
chair
,
Mr.
Vavasor
?
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Vavasor
;
"
I
will
stand
up
.
"
<EOS>
And
he
stood
up
,
holding
his
hat
behind
his
back
with
his
left
hand
,
with
his
right
leg
forward
,
and
the
thumb
of
his
right
hand
in
his
waistcoat
-
pocket
.
<EOS>
He
looked
full
into
Grey
's
face
,
and
Grey
looked
full
into
his
;
and
as
he
looked
the
great
cicatrice
seemed
to
open
itself
and
to
become
purple
with
fresh
blood
stains
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
come
here
from
Mr.
Tombe
's
office
in
the
City
,
"
said
Vavasor
,
"
to
ask
you
of
what
nature
has
been
the
interference
which
you
have
taken
in
my
money
matters
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
was
a
question
which
Mr.
Grey
could
not
answer
very
quickly
.
<EOS>
In
the
first
place
it
was
altogether
unexpected
;
in
the
next
place
he
did
not
know
what
Mr.
Tombe
had
told
,
and
what
he
had
not
told
;
and
then
,
before
he
replied
,
he
must
think
how
much
of
the
truth
he
was
bound
to
tell
in
answer
to
a
question
so
put
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
say
that
you
have
come
from
Mr.
Tombe
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
heard
me
say
so
.
<EOS>
I
have
come
here
direct
from
Mr.
Tombe
's
chambers
.
<EOS>
He
is
your
lawyer
,
I
believe
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
I
have
come
from
him
to
ask
you
what
interference
you
have
lately
taken
in
my
money
matters
.
<EOS>
When
you
have
answered
that
,
I
shall
have
other
questions
to
ask
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
Mr.
Vavasor
,
has
it
occurred
to
you
that
I
may
not
be
disposed
to
answer
questions
so
asked
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
has
not
occurred
to
me
to
think
that
you
will
prevaricate
.
<EOS>
If
there
has
been
no
such
interference
,
I
will
ask
your
pardon
,
and
go
away
;
but
if
there
has
been
such
interference
on
your
part
,
I
have
a
right
to
demand
that
you
shall
explain
to
me
its
nature
.
"
  
<EOS>
Grey
had
now
made
up
his
mind
that
it
would
be
better
that
he
should
tell
the
whole
story
,
 
better
not
only
for
himself
,
but
for
all
the
Vavasors
,
including
this
angry
man
himself
.
<EOS>
The
angry
man
evidently
knew
something
,
and
it
would
be
better
that
he
should
know
the
truth
.
<EOS>
"
There
has
been
such
interference
,
Mr.
Vavasor
,
if
you
choose
to
call
it
so
.
<EOS>
Money
,
to
the
extent
of
two
thousand
pounds
,
I
think
,
has
by
my
directions
been
paid
to
your
credit
by
Mr.
Tombe
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
said
Vavasor
,
taking
his
right
hand
away
from
his
waistcoat
,
and
tapping
the
round
table
with
his
fingers
impatiently
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hardly
know
how
to
explain
all
the
circumstances
under
which
this
has
been
done
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
dare
say
not
;
but
,
nevertheless
,
you
must
explain
them
.
"
  
<EOS>
Grey
was
a
man
tranquil
in
temperament
,
very
little
prone
to
quarrelling
,
with
perhaps
an
exaggerated
idea
of
the
evil
results
of
a
row
,
 
a
man
who
would
take
infinite
trouble
to
avoid
any
such
scene
as
that
which
now
seemed
to
be
imminent
;
but
he
was
a
man
whose
courage
was
quite
as
high
as
that
of
his
opponent
.
<EOS>
To
bully
or
be
bullied
were
alike
contrary
to
his
nature
.
<EOS>
It
was
clear
enough
now
that
Vavasor
intended
to
bully
him
,
and
he
made
up
his
mind
at
once
that
if
the
quarrel
were
forced
upon
him
it
should
find
him
ready
to
take
his
own
part
.
<EOS>
"
My
difficulty
in
explaining
it
comes
from
consideration
for
you
,
"
he
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
I
beg
that
your
difficulty
will
cease
,
and
that
you
will
have
no
consideration
for
me
.
<EOS>
We
are
so
circumstanced
towards
each
other
that
any
consideration
must
be
humbug
and
nonsense
.
<EOS>
At
any
rate
,
I
intend
to
have
none
for
you
.
<EOS>
Now
,
let
me
know
why
you
have
meddled
with
my
matters
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
might
,
perhaps
,
better
refer
you
to
your
uncle
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
;
Mr.
Tombe
is
not
my
uncle
's
lawyer
.
<EOS>
My
uncle
never
heard
his
name
,
unless
he
heard
of
it
from
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
it
was
by
agreement
with
your
uncle
that
I
commissioned
Mr.
Tombe
to
raise
for
you
the
money
you
were
desirous
of
borrowing
from
your
cousin
.
<EOS>
We
thought
it
better
that
her
fortune
should
not
be
for
the
moment
disturbed
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
what
had
you
to
do
with
it
?
<EOS>
Why
should
you
have
done
it
?
<EOS>
In
the
first
place
,
I
do
n't
believe
your
story
;
it
is
altogether
improbable
.
<EOS>
But
why
should
he
come
to
you
of
all
men
to
raise
money
on
his
daughter
's
behalf
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Unless
you
can
behave
yourself
with
more
discretion
,
Mr.
Vavasor
,
you
must
leave
the
room
,
"
said
Mr.
Grey
.
<EOS>
Then
,
as
Vavasor
simply
sneered
at
him
,
but
spoke
nothing
,
he
went
on
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
I
who
suggested
to
your
uncle
that
this
arrangement
should
be
made
.
<EOS>
I
did
not
wish
to
see
Miss
Vavasor
's
fortune
squandered
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
was
her
fortune
to
you
,
sir
?
<EOS>
Are
you
aware
that
she
is
engaged
to
me
as
my
wife
?
<EOS>
I
ask
you
,
sir
,
whether
you
are
aware
that
Miss
Vavasor
is
to
be
my
wife
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
altogether
decline
to
discuss
with
you
Miss
Vavasor
's
present
or
future
position
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
By
heavens
,
then
,
you
shall
hear
me
discuss
it
!
<EOS>
She
was
engaged
to
you
,
and
she
has
given
you
your
dismissal
.
<EOS>
If
you
had
understood
anything
of
the
conduct
which
is
usual
among
gentlemen
,
or
if
you
had
had
any
particle
of
pride
in
you
,
sir
,
you
would
have
left
her
and
never
mentioned
her
name
again
.
<EOS>
I
now
find
you
meddling
with
her
money
matters
,
so
as
to
get
a
hold
upon
her
fortune
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
hold
upon
her
fortune
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
,
you
have
.
<EOS>
You
do
not
advance
two
thousand
pounds
without
knowing
that
you
have
security
.
<EOS>
She
has
rejected
you
;
and
in
order
that
you
may
be
revenged
,
or
that
you
may
have
some
further
hold
upon
her
,
 
that
she
may
be
in
some
sort
within
your
power
,
you
have
contrived
this
rascally
pettifogging
way
of
obtaining
power
over
her
income
.
<EOS>
The
money
shall
be
repaid
at
once
,
with
any
interest
that
can
be
due
;
and
if
I
find
you
interfering
again
,
I
will
expose
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Vavasor
,
"
said
Grey
very
slowly
,
in
a
low
tone
of
voice
,
but
with
something
in
his
eye
which
would
have
told
any
bystander
that
he
was
much
in
earnest
,
"
you
have
used
words
in
your
anger
which
I
can
not
allow
to
pass
.
<EOS>
You
must
recall
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
were
the
words
?
<EOS>
I
said
that
you
were
a
pettifogging
rascal
.
<EOS>
I
now
repeat
them
.
<EOS>
"
As
he
spoke
he
put
on
his
hat
,
so
as
to
leave
both
his
hands
ready
for
action
if
action
should
be
required
.
  
<EOS>
Grey
was
much
the
larger
man
and
much
the
stronger
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
doubted
whether
he
knew
himself
the
extent
of
his
own
strength
,
but
such
as
it
was
he
resolved
that
he
must
now
use
it
.
<EOS>
"
There
is
no
help
for
it
,
"
he
said
,
as
he
also
prepared
for
action
.
<EOS>
The
first
thing
he
did
was
to
open
the
door
,
and
as
he
did
so
he
became
conscious
that
his
mouth
was
full
of
blood
from
a
sharp
blow
upon
his
face
.
<EOS>
Vavasor
had
struck
him
with
his
fist
,
and
had
cut
his
lip
against
his
teeth
.
<EOS>
Then
there
came
a
scramble
,
and
Grey
was
soon
aware
that
he
had
his
opponent
in
his
hands
.
<EOS>
I
doubt
whether
he
had
attempted
to
strike
a
blow
,
or
whether
he
had
so
much
as
clenched
his
fist
.
<EOS>
Vavasor
had
struck
him
repeatedly
,
but
the
blows
had
fallen
on
his
body
or
his
head
,
and
he
was
unconscious
of
them
.
<EOS>
He
had
but
one
object
now
in
his
mind
,
and
that
object
was
the
kicking
his
assailant
down
the
stairs
.
<EOS>
Then
came
a
scramble
,
as
I
have
said
,
and
Grey
had
a
hold
of
the
smaller
man
by
the
nape
of
his
neck
.
<EOS>
So
holding
him
he
forced
him
back
through
the
door
on
to
the
landing
,
and
there
succeeded
in
pushing
him
down
the
first
flight
of
steps
.
<EOS>
Grey
kicked
at
him
as
he
went
,
but
the
kick
was
impotent
.
<EOS>
He
had
,
however
,
been
so
far
successful
that
he
had
thrust
his
enemy
out
of
the
room
,
and
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
him
sprawling
on
the
landing
-
place
.
  
<EOS>
Vavasor
,
when
he
raised
himself
,
prepared
to
make
another
rush
at
the
room
,
but
before
he
could
do
so
a
man
from
below
,
hearing
the
noise
,
had
come
upon
him
and
interrupted
him
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Jones
,
"
said
Grey
,
speaking
from
above
,
"
if
that
gentleman
does
not
leave
the
house
,
I
must
get
you
to
search
for
a
policeman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Vavasor
,
though
the
lodging
-
house
man
had
hold
of
the
collar
of
his
coat
,
made
no
attempt
to
turn
upon
his
new
enemy
.
<EOS>
When
two
dogs
are
fighting
,
any
bystander
may
attempt
to
separate
them
with
impunity
.
<EOS>
The
brutes
are
so
anxious
to
tear
each
other
that
they
have
no
energies
left
for
other
purposes
.
<EOS>
It
never
occurs
to
them
to
turn
their
teeth
upon
newcomers
in
the
quarrel
.
<EOS>
So
it
was
with
George
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
Jones
was
sufficient
to
prevent
his
further
attack
upon
the
foe
up
-
stairs
,
and
therefore
he
had
no
alternative
but
to
relinquish
the
fight
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
's
it
all
about
,
sir
?
"
said
Jones
,
who
kept
a
tailor
's
establishment
,
and
,
as
a
tailor
,
was
something
of
a
fighting
man
himself
.
<EOS>
Of
all
tradesmen
in
London
<EOS>
the
tailors
are
,
no
doubt
,
the
most
combative
,
 
as
might
be
expected
from
the
necessity
which
lies
upon
them
of
living
down
the
general
bad
character
in
this
respect
which
the
world
has
wrongly
given
them
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
's
it
all
about
,
sir
?
"
said
Jones
,
still
holding
Vavasor
by
his
coat
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
man
has
ill
-
used
me
,
and
I
've
punished
him
;
that
's
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
much
about
punishing
,
"
said
the
tailor
.
<EOS>
"
It
seems
to
me
he
pitched
you
down
pretty
clean
out
of
the
room
above
.
<EOS>
I
think
the
best
thing
you
can
do
now
is
to
walk
yourself
off
.
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
the
only
thing
that
Vavasor
could
do
,
and
he
did
walk
himself
off
.
<EOS>
He
walked
himself
off
,
and
went
home
to
his
own
lodgings
in
Cecil
Street
,
that
he
might
smooth
his
feathers
after
the
late
encounter
before
he
went
down
to
Westminster
to
take
his
seat
in
the
House
of
Commons
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
that
he
was
comfortable
when
he
got
there
,
or
that
he
felt
himself
very
well
able
to
fight
another
battle
that
night
on
behalf
of
the
River
Bank
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
been
hurt
,
but
he
had
been
worsted
.
<EOS>
Grey
had
probably
received
more
personal
damage
than
had
fallen
to
his
share
;
but
Grey
had
succeeded
in
expelling
him
from
the
room
,
and
he
knew
that
he
had
been
found
prostrate
on
the
landing
-
place
when
the
tailor
first
saw
him
.
  
<EOS>
But
he
might
probably
have
got
over
the
annoyance
of
this
feeling
<EOS>
had
he
not
been
overwhelmed
by
a
consciousness
that
everything
was
going
badly
with
him
.
<EOS>
He
was
already
beginning
to
hate
his
seat
in
Parliament
.
<EOS>
What
good
had
it
done
for
him
,
or
was
it
likely
to
do
for
him
?
<EOS>
He
found
himself
to
be
associated
there
with
Mr.
Bott
,
and
a
few
others
of
the
same
class
,
 
men
whom
he
despised
;
and
even
they
did
not
admit
him
among
them
without
a
certain
show
of
superiority
on
their
part
.
<EOS>
Who
has
not
ascertained
by
his
own
experience
the
different
lights
through
which
the
same
events
may
be
seen
,
according
to
the
success
,
or
want
of
success
,
which
pervades
the
atmosphere
at
the
moment
?
<EOS>
At
the
present
time
everything
was
unsuccessful
with
George
Vavasor
;
and
though
he
told
himself
,
almost
from
hour
to
hour
,
that
he
would
go
on
with
the
thing
which
he
had
begun
,
 
that
he
would
persevere
in
Parliament
till
he
had
obtained
a
hearing
there
and
created
for
himself
success
,
he
could
not
himself
believe
in
the
promises
which
he
had
made
to
himself
.
<EOS>
He
had
looked
forward
to
his
entrance
into
that
Chamber
as
the
hour
of
his
triumph
;
but
he
had
entered
it
with
Mr.
Bott
,
and
there
had
been
no
triumph
to
him
in
doing
so
.
<EOS>
He
had
sworn
to
himself
that
when
there
he
would
find
men
to
hear
him
.
<EOS>
Hitherto
,
indeed
,
he
could
not
accuse
himself
of
having
missed
his
opportunities
;
his
election
had
been
so
recent
that
he
could
hardly
yet
have
made
the
attempt
.
<EOS>
But
he
had
been
there
long
enough
to
learn
to
fancy
that
there
was
no
glory
in
attempting
.
<EOS>
This
art
of
speaking
in
Parliament
,
which
had
appeared
to
him
to
be
so
grand
,
seemed
already
to
be
a
humdrum
,
homely
,
dull
affair
.
<EOS>
No
one
seemed
to
listen
much
to
what
was
said
.
<EOS>
To
such
as
himself
,
 
Members
without
an
acquired
name
,
 
men
did
not
seem
to
listen
at
all
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
had
once
,
in
his
hearing
,
spoken
for
two
hours
together
,
and
all
the
House
had
treated
his
speech
with
respect
,
 
had
declared
that
it
was
useful
,
solid
,
conscientious
,
and
what
not
;
but
more
than
half
the
House
had
been
asleep
more
than
half
the
time
that
he
was
on
his
legs
.
<EOS>
Vavasor
had
not
as
yet
commenced
his
career
as
an
orator
;
but
night
after
night
,
as
he
sat
there
,
the
chance
of
commencing
it
with
brilliance
seemed
to
be
further
from
him
,
and
still
further
.
<EOS>
Two
thousand
pounds
of
his
own
money
,
and
two
thousand
more
of
Alice
's
money
,
 
or
of
Mr.
Grey
's
,
 
<EOS>
he
had
already
spent
to
make
his
way
into
that
assembly
.
<EOS>
He
must
spend
,
at
any
rate
,
two
thousand
more
if
he
intended
that
his
career
should
be
prolonged
beyond
a
three
months
'
sitting
;
 
and
how
was
he
to
get
this
further
sum
after
what
had
taken
place
to
-
day
?
  
<EOS>
He
would
get
it
.
<EOS>
That
was
his
resolve
as
he
walked
in
by
the
apple
-
woman
's
stall
,
under
the
shadow
of
the
great
policeman
,
and
between
the
two
august
lamps
.
<EOS>
He
would
get
it
;
 
as
long
as
Alice
had
a
pound
over
which
he
could
obtain
mastery
by
any
act
or
violence
within
his
compass
.
<EOS>
He
would
get
it
;
even
though
it
should
come
through
the
hands
of
John
Grey
and
Mr.
Tombe
.
<EOS>
He
would
get
it
;
though
in
doing
so
he
might
destroy
his
cousin
Alice
and
ruin
his
sister
Kate
.
<EOS>
He
had
gone
too
far
to
stick
at
any
scruples
.
<EOS>
Had
he
not
often
declared
how
great
had
been
that
murderer
who
had
been
able
to
divest
himself
of
all
such
scruples
,
 
who
had
scoured
his
bosom
free
from
all
fears
of
the
hereafter
,
and
,
as
regarded
the
present
,
had
dared
to
trust
for
everything
to
success
?
<EOS>
He
would
go
to
Alice
and
demand
the
money
from
her
with
threats
,
and
with
that
violence
in
his
eyes
which
he
knew
so
well
how
to
assume
.
<EOS>
He
believed
that
when
he
so
demanded
it
,
the
money
would
be
forthcoming
so
as
to
satisfy
,
at
any
rate
,
his
present
emergencies
.
  
<EOS>
That
wretched
old
man
in
Westmoreland
!
<EOS>
If
he
would
but
die
,
there
might
yet
be
a
hope
remaining
of
permanent
success
!
<EOS>
Even
though
the
estate
might
be
entailed
so
as
to
give
him
no
more
than
a
life
-
interest
,
still
money
might
be
raised
on
it
.
<EOS>
His
life
-
interest
in
it
would
be
worth
ten
or
twelve
years
<EOS>
"
purchase
.
<EOS>
He
had
an
idea
that
his
grandfather
had
not
as
yet
made
any
such
will
when
he
left
the
place
in
Westmoreland
.
<EOS>
What
a
boon
it
would
be
if
death
could
be
made
to
overtake
the
old
man
before
he
did
so
!
<EOS>
On
this
very
night
he
walked
about
the
lobbies
of
the
House
,
thinking
of
all
this
.
<EOS>
He
went
by
himself
from
room
to
room
,
roaming
along
passages
,
sitting
now
for
ten
minutes
in
the
gallery
,
and
then
again
for
a
short
space
in
the
body
of
the
House
,
 
till
he
would
get
up
and
wander
again
out
into
the
lobby
,
impatient
of
the
neighbourhood
of
Mr.
Bott
.
<EOS>
Certainly
just
at
this
time
he
felt
no
desire
to
bring
before
the
House
the
subject
of
the
River
Embankment
.
  
<EOS>
Nor
was
Mr.
Grey
much
happier
when
he
was
left
alone
,
than
was
his
assailant
.
<EOS>
To
give
Vavasor
his
due
,
the
memory
of
the
affray
itself
did
not
long
trouble
him
much
.
<EOS>
The
success
between
the
combatants
had
been
nearly
equal
,
and
he
had
,
at
any
rate
,
spoken
his
mind
freely
.
<EOS>
His
misery
had
come
from
other
sources
.
<EOS>
But
the
reflection
that
he
had
been
concerned
in
a
row
was
in
itself
enough
to
make
John
Grey
wretched
for
the
time
.
<EOS>
Such
a
misfortune
had
never
hitherto
befallen
him
.
<EOS>
In
all
his
dealings
with
men
words
had
been
sufficient
,
and
generally
words
of
courtesy
had
sufficed
.
<EOS>
To
have
been
personally
engaged
in
a
fighting
scramble
with
such
a
man
as
George
Vavasor
was
to
him
terrible
.
<EOS>
When
ordering
that
his
money
might
be
expended
with
the
possible
object
of
saving
Alice
from
her
cousin
,
he
had
never
felt
a
moment
's
regret
;
he
had
never
thought
that
he
was
doing
more
than
circumstances
fairly
demanded
of
him
.
<EOS>
But
now
he
was
almost
driven
to
utter
reproach
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
Alice
!
<EOS>
that
this
thing
should
have
come
upon
me
through
thy
fault
!
"
  
<EOS>
When
Vavasor
was
led
away
down
stairs
by
the
tailor
,
and
Grey
found
that
no
more
actual
fighting
would
be
required
of
him
,
he
retired
into
his
bedroom
,
that
he
might
wash
his
mouth
and
free
himself
from
the
stains
of
the
combat
.
<EOS>
He
had
heard
the
front
door
closed
,
and
knew
that
the
miscreant
was
gone
,
 
the
miscreant
who
had
disturbed
his
quiet
.
<EOS>
Then
he
began
to
think
what
was
the
accusation
with
which
Vavasor
had
charged
him
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
told
that
he
had
advanced
money
on
behalf
of
Alice
,
in
order
that
he
might
obtain
some
power
over
Alice
's
fortune
,
and
thus
revenge
himself
upon
Alice
for
her
treatment
of
him
.
<EOS>
Nothing
could
be
more
damnably
false
than
this
accusation
.
<EOS>
Of
that
he
was
well
aware
.
<EOS>
But
were
not
the
circumstances
of
a
nature
to
make
it
appear
that
the
accusation
was
true
?
<EOS>
Security
for
the
money
advanced
by
him
,
of
course
,
he
had
none
;
 
<EOS>
of
course
he
had
desired
none
;
 
of
course
the
money
had
been
given
out
of
his
own
pocket
with
the
sole
object
of
saving
Alice
,
if
that
might
be
possible
;
but
of
all
those
who
might
hear
of
this
affair
,
how
many
would
know
or
even
guess
the
truth
?
  
<EOS>
While
he
was
in
this
wretched
state
of
mind
,
washing
his
mouth
,
and
disturbing
his
spirit
,
Mr.
Jones
,
his
landlord
,
came
up
to
him
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Jones
had
known
him
for
some
years
,
and
entertained
a
most
profound
respect
for
his
character
.
<EOS>
A
rather
sporting
man
than
otherwise
was
Mr.
Jones
.
<EOS>
His
father
had
been
a
tradesman
at
Cambridge
,
and
in
this
way
Jones
had
become
known
to
Mr.
Grey
.
<EOS>
But
though
given
to
sport
,
by
which
he
meant
modern
prize
-
fighting
and
the
Epsom
course
on
the
Derby
day
,
Mr.
Jones
was
a
man
who
dearly
loved
respectable
customers
and
respectable
lodgers
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Grey
,
with
his
property
at
Nethercoats
,
and
his
august
manners
,
and
his
reputation
at
Cambridge
,
was
a
most
respectable
lodger
,
and
Mr.
Jones
could
hardly
understand
how
any
one
could
presume
to
raise
his
hand
against
such
a
man
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
,
dear
,
sir
 
this
is
a
terrible
affair
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
as
he
made
his
way
into
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
very
disagreeable
,
certainly
,
"
said
Grey
.
  
<EOS>
"
Was
the
gentleman
known
to
you
?
"
asked
the
tailor
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
;
I
know
who
he
is
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Any
quarrel
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
yes
.
<EOS>
I
should
not
have
pushed
him
down
stairs
had
he
not
quarrelled
with
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
can
have
the
police
after
him
if
you
wish
it
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
wish
it
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Or
we
might
manage
to
polish
him
off
in
any
other
way
,
you
know
.
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
some
time
before
Mr.
Grey
could
get
rid
of
the
tailor
,
but
he
did
so
at
last
without
having
told
any
part
of
the
story
to
that
warlike
,
worthy
,
and
very
anxious
individual
.
   
<EOS>
The
Last
Will
of
the
Old
Squire
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
Kate
Vavasor
was
living
down
in
Westmoreland
,
with
no
other
society
than
that
of
her
grandfather
,
and
did
not
altogether
have
a
very
pleasant
life
of
it
.
<EOS>
George
had
been
apt
to
represent
the
old
man
to
himself
as
being
as
strong
as
an
old
tower
,
which
,
though
it
be
but
a
ruin
,
shows
no
sign
of
falling
.
<EOS>
To
his
eyes
the
Squire
had
always
seemed
to
be
full
of
life
and
power
.
<EOS>
He
could
be
violent
on
occasions
,
and
was
hardly
ever
without
violence
in
his
eyes
and
voice
.
<EOS>
But
George
's
opinion
was
formed
by
his
wish
,
or
rather
by
the
reverses
of
his
wish
.
<EOS>
For
years
he
had
been
longing
that
his
grandfather
should
die
,
 
had
been
accusing
Fate
of
gross
injustice
in
that
she
did
not
snap
the
thread
;
and
with
such
thoughts
in
his
mind
he
had
grudged
every
ounce
which
the
Squire
's
vigour
had
been
able
to
sustain
.
<EOS>
He
had
almost
taught
himself
to
believe
that
it
would
be
a
good
deed
to
squeeze
what
remained
of
life
out
of
that
violent
old
throat
.
<EOS>
But
,
indeed
,
the
embers
of
life
were
burning
low
;
and
had
George
known
all
the
truth
,
he
would
hardly
have
inclined
his
mind
to
thoughts
of
murder
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
,
indeed
,
very
weak
with
age
,
and
tottering
with
unsteady
steps
on
the
brink
of
his
grave
,
though
he
would
still
come
down
early
from
his
room
,
and
would
,
if
possible
,
creep
out
about
the
garden
and
into
the
farmyard
.
<EOS>
He
would
still
sit
down
to
dinner
,
and
would
drink
his
allotted
portion
of
port
wine
,
in
the
doctor
's
teeth
.
<EOS>
The
doctor
by
no
means
desired
to
rob
him
of
his
last
luxury
,
or
even
to
stint
his
quantity
;
but
he
recommended
certain
changes
in
the
mode
and
time
of
taking
it
.
<EOS>
Against
this
,
however
,
the
old
Squire
indignantly
rebelled
,
and
scolded
Kate
almost
off
her
legs
when
she
attempted
to
enforce
the
doctor
's
orders
.
<EOS>
"
What
the
mischief
does
it
signify
,
"
the
old
man
said
to
her
one
evening
;
 
"
what
difference
will
it
make
whether
I
am
dead
or
alive
,
unless
it
is
that
George
would
turn
you
out
of
the
house
<EOS>
directly
he
gets
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
not
thinking
of
any
one
but
yourself
,
sir
,
"
said
Kate
,
with
a
tear
in
her
eye
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
wo
n't
be
troubled
to
think
of
me
much
longer
,
"
said
the
Squire
;
and
then
he
gulped
down
the
remaining
half
of
his
glass
of
wine
.
  
<EOS>
Kate
was
,
in
truth
,
very
good
to
him
.
<EOS>
Women
always
are
good
under
such
circumstances
;
and
Kate
Vavasor
was
one
who
would
certainly
stick
to
such
duties
as
now
fell
to
her
lot
.
<EOS>
She
was
eminently
true
and
loyal
to
her
friends
,
though
she
could
be
as
false
on
their
behalf
as
most
false
people
can
be
on
their
own
.
<EOS>
She
was
very
good
to
the
old
man
,
tending
all
his
wants
,
taking
his
violence
with
good
-
humour
rather
than
with
submission
,
not
opposing
him
with
direct
contradiction
when
he
abused
his
grandson
,
but
saying
little
words
to
mitigate
his
wrath
,
if
it
were
possible
.
<EOS>
At
such
times
the
Squire
would
tell
her
that
she
also
would
learn
to
know
her
brother
's
character
some
day
.
<EOS>
"
You
'll
live
to
be
robbed
by
him
,
and
turned
out
as
naked
as
you
were
born
,
"
he
said
to
her
one
day
.
<EOS>
Then
Kate
fired
up
and
declared
that
she
fully
trusted
her
brother
's
love
.
<EOS>
Whatever
faults
he
might
have
,
he
had
been
staunch
to
her
,
<EOS>
So
she
said
,
and
<EOS>
the
old
man
sneered
at
her
for
saying
so
.
  
<EOS>
One
morning
,
soon
after
this
,
when
she
brought
him
up
to
his
bedroom
some
mixture
of
thin
porridge
,
which
he
still
endeavoured
to
swallow
for
his
breakfast
,
he
bade
her
sit
down
,
and
began
to
talk
to
her
about
the
property
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
you
are
a
fool
,
"
he
said
,
"
about
all
matters
of
business
;
 
more
of
a
fool
than
even
women
generally
are
.
"
<EOS>
To
this
Kate
acceded
with
a
little
smile
,
 
acknowledging
that
her
understanding
was
limited
.
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
see
Gogram
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
Do
you
write
to
him
a
line
,
telling
him
to
come
here
to
-
day
,
 
he
or
one
of
his
men
,
 
and
send
it
at
once
by
Peter
.
<EOS>
"
Gogram
was
an
attorney
who
lived
at
Penrith
,
and
who
was
never
summoned
to
Vavasor
Hall
unless
the
Squire
had
something
to
say
about
his
will
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
think
you
'd
better
put
it
off
till
you
are
a
little
stronger
?
"
said
Kate
.
<EOS>
Whereupon
the
Squire
fired
at
her
such
a
volley
of
oaths
that
she
sprang
off
the
chair
on
which
she
was
sitting
,
and
darted
across
to
a
little
table
at
which
there
was
pen
and
ink
,
and
wrote
her
note
to
Mr.
Gogram
,
before
she
had
recovered
from
the
shaking
which
the
battery
had
given
her
.
<EOS>
She
wrote
the
note
,
and
ran
away
with
it
to
Peter
,
and
saw
Peter
on
the
pony
on
his
way
to
Penrith
,
before
she
dared
to
return
to
her
grandfather
's
bedside
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
should
you
do
with
the
estate
if
I
left
it
you
?
"
<EOS>
the
Squire
said
to
her
the
first
moment
she
was
again
back
with
him
.
  
<EOS>
This
was
a
question
she
could
not
answer
instantly
.
<EOS>
She
stood
by
his
bedside
for
a
while
thinking
,
 
holding
her
grandfather
's
hand
and
looking
down
upon
the
bed
.
<EOS>
He
,
with
his
rough
watery
old
eyes
,
was
gazing
up
into
her
face
,
as
though
he
were
trying
to
read
her
thoughts
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
should
give
it
to
my
brother
,
"
she
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
I
'm
d
 
---
if
I
'll
leave
it
to
you
,
"
said
he
.
  
<EOS>
She
did
not
jump
now
,
though
he
had
sworn
at
her
.
<EOS>
She
still
stood
,
holding
his
hand
softly
,
and
looking
down
upon
the
bed
.
<EOS>
"
If
I
were
you
,
grandfather
,
"
she
said
almost
in
a
whisper
,
"
I
would
not
trust
myself
to
alter
family
arrangements
whilst
I
was
ill
.
<EOS>
I
'm
sure
you
would
advise
any
one
else
against
doing
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
if
I
were
to
leave
it
to
Alice
,
she
'd
give
it
to
him
too
,
"
he
said
,
speaking
his
thoughts
out
loud
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
it
is
<EOS>
you
see
in
him
,
I
never
could
even
guess
.
<EOS>
He
's
as
ugly
as
a
baboon
,
with
his
scarred
face
.
<EOS>
He
has
never
done
anything
to
show
himself
a
clever
fellow
.
<EOS>
Kate
,
give
me
some
of
that
bottle
the
man
sent
.
"
<EOS>
Kate
handed
him
his
medicine
,
and
then
stood
again
by
his
bedside
.
  
<EOS>
"
Where
did
he
get
the
money
to
pay
for
his
election
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
Squire
asked
,
as
soon
as
he
had
swallowed
the
draught
.
<EOS>
"
They
would
n't
give
such
a
one
as
him
credit
a
yard
further
than
they
could
see
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
where
he
got
it
,
"
said
Kate
,
lying
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
has
not
had
yours
;
has
he
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
would
not
take
it
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
offered
it
to
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
he
has
not
had
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
a
penny
of
it
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
made
you
offer
it
to
him
after
what
I
said
to
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Because
it
was
my
own
,
"
said
Kate
,
stoutly
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
're
the
biggest
idiot
that
ever
I
heard
of
,
and
you
'll
know
it
yourself
some
day
.
<EOS>
Go
away
now
,
and
let
me
know
when
Gogram
comes
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
went
away
,
and
for
a
time
employed
herself
about
her
ordinary
household
work
.
<EOS>
Then
she
sat
down
alone
in
the
dingy
old
dining
-
room
,
to
think
what
had
better
be
done
in
her
present
circumstances
.
<EOS>
The
carpet
of
the
room
was
worn
out
,
as
were
also
the
covers
of
the
old
chairs
and
the
horsehair
sofa
which
was
never
moved
from
its
accustomed
place
along
the
wall
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
a
comfortable
Squire
's
residence
,
this
old
house
at
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
In
the
last
twenty
years
no
money
had
been
spent
on
furniture
or
embellishments
,
and
for
the
last
ten
years
there
had
been
no
painting
,
either
inside
or
out
.
<EOS>
Twenty
years
ago
the
Squire
had
been
an
embarrassed
man
,
and
had
taken
a
turn
in
his
life
and
had
lived
sparingly
.
<EOS>
It
could
not
be
said
that
he
had
become
a
miser
.
<EOS>
His
table
was
kept
plentifully
,
and
there
had
never
been
want
in
his
house
.
<EOS>
In
some
respects
,
too
,
he
had
behaved
liberally
to
Kate
and
to
others
,
and
he
had
kept
up
the
timber
and
fences
on
the
property
.
<EOS>
But
the
house
had
become
wretched
in
its
dull
,
sombre
,
dirty
darkness
,
and
the
gardens
round
it
were
as
bad
.
  
<EOS>
What
ought
she
now
to
do
?
<EOS>
She
believed
that
her
grandfather
's
last
days
were
coming
,
and
she
knew
that
others
of
the
family
should
be
with
him
besides
herself
.
<EOS>
For
their
sakes
,
for
his
,
and
for
her
own
,
it
would
be
proper
that
she
should
not
be
alone
there
when
he
died
.
<EOS>
But
for
whom
should
she
send
?
<EOS>
Her
brother
was
the
natural
heir
,
and
would
be
the
head
of
the
family
.
<EOS>
Her
duty
to
him
was
clear
,
and
the
more
so
as
her
grandfather
was
at
this
moment
speaking
of
changes
in
his
will
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
a
question
to
her
whether
George
's
presence
at
Vavasor
,
even
if
he
would
come
,
would
not
at
this
moment
do
more
harm
than
good
to
his
own
interests
.
<EOS>
It
would
make
some
prejudicial
change
in
the
old
man
's
will
more
probable
instead
of
less
so
.
<EOS>
George
would
not
become
soft
and
mild
-
spoken
even
by
a
death
-
bed
side
,
and
it
would
be
likely
enough
that
the
Squire
would
curse
his
heir
with
his
dying
breath
.
<EOS>
She
might
send
for
her
uncle
John
;
but
if
she
did
so
without
telling
George
she
would
be
treating
George
unfairly
;
and
she
knew
that
it
was
improbable
that
her
uncle
and
her
brother
should
act
together
in
anything
.
<EOS>
Her
aunt
Greenow
,
she
thought
,
would
come
to
her
,
and
her
presence
would
not
influence
the
Squire
in
any
way
with
reference
to
the
property
.
<EOS>
So
she
made
up
her
mind
at
last
that
she
would
ask
her
aunt
to
come
to
Vavasor
,
and
that
she
would
tell
her
brother
accurately
all
that
she
could
tell
,
 
leaving
him
to
come
or
stay
,
as
he
might
think
.
<EOS>
Alice
would
,
no
doubt
,
learn
all
the
facts
from
him
,
and
her
uncle
John
would
hear
them
from
Alice
.
<EOS>
Then
they
could
do
as
they
pleased
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
Mr.
Gogram
had
been
there
she
would
write
her
letters
,
and
they
should
be
sent
over
to
Shap
early
on
the
following
morning
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Gogram
came
and
was
closeted
with
the
Squire
,
and
the
doctor
also
came
.
<EOS>
The
doctor
saw
Kate
,
and
,
shaking
his
head
,
told
her
that
her
grandfather
was
sinking
lower
and
lower
every
hour
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
infinitely
better
for
him
if
he
would
take
that
port
wine
at
four
doses
in
the
day
,
or
even
at
two
,
instead
of
taking
it
all
together
.
<EOS>
Kate
promised
to
try
again
,
but
stated
her
conviction
that
the
trial
would
be
useless
.
<EOS>
The
doctor
,
when
pressed
on
the
matter
,
said
that
his
patient
might
probably
live
a
week
,
not
improbably
a
fortnight
,
 
perhaps
a
month
,
if
he
would
be
obedient
,
 
and
so
forth
.
<EOS>
Gogram
went
away
without
seeing
Kate
;
and
Kate
,
who
looked
upon
a
will
as
an
awful
and
somewhat
tedious
ceremony
,
was
in
doubt
whether
her
grandfather
would
live
to
complete
any
new
operation
.
<EOS>
But
,
in
truth
,
the
will
had
been
made
and
signed
and
witnessed
,
 
the
parish
clerk
and
one
of
the
tenants
having
been
had
up
into
the
room
as
witnesses
.
<EOS>
Kate
knew
that
the
men
had
been
there
,
but
still
did
not
think
that
a
new
will
had
been
perfected
.
  
<EOS>
That
evening
when
it
was
dusk
the
Squire
came
into
the
dining
-
room
,
having
been
shuffling
about
the
grand
sweep
before
the
house
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
.
<EOS>
The
day
was
cold
and
the
wind
bleak
,
but
still
he
would
go
out
,
and
Kate
had
wrapped
him
up
carefully
in
mufflers
and
great
-
coats
.
<EOS>
Now
he
came
in
to
what
he
called
dinner
,
and
Kate
sat
down
with
him
.
<EOS>
He
had
drank
no
wine
that
day
,
although
she
had
brought
it
to
him
twice
during
the
morning
.
<EOS>
Now
he
attempted
to
swallow
a
little
soup
,
but
failed
;
and
after
that
,
while
Kate
was
eating
her
bit
of
chicken
,
had
the
decanter
put
before
him
.
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
eat
,
and
I
suppose
it
wo
n't
hurt
you
if
I
take
my
wine
at
once
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
It
went
against
the
grain
with
him
,
even
yet
,
that
he
could
not
wait
till
the
cloth
was
gone
from
the
table
,
but
his
impatience
for
the
only
sustenance
that
he
could
take
was
too
much
for
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
should
eat
something
,
sir
;
will
you
have
a
bit
of
toast
to
sop
in
your
wine
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
word
"
sop
"
was
badly
chosen
,
and
made
the
old
Squire
angry
.
"
<EOS>
Sopped
toast
!
<EOS>
why
am
I
to
spoil
the
only
thing
I
can
enjoy
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
the
wine
would
do
you
more
good
if
you
would
take
something
with
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Good
!
<EOS>
Nothing
will
do
me
any
good
any
more
.
<EOS>
As
for
eating
,
you
know
I
ca
n't
eat
.
<EOS>
What
's
the
use
of
bothering
me
?
"
<EOS>
Then
he
filled
his
second
glass
,
and
paused
awhile
before
he
put
it
to
his
lips
.
<EOS>
He
never
exceeded
four
glasses
,
but
the
four
he
was
determined
that
he
would
have
,
as
long
as
he
could
lift
them
to
his
mouth
.
  
<EOS>
Kate
finished
,
or
pretended
to
finish
,
her
dinner
within
five
minutes
,
in
order
that
the
table
might
be
made
to
look
comfortable
for
him
.
<EOS>
Then
she
poked
the
fire
,
and
brushed
up
the
hearth
,
and
closed
the
old
curtains
with
her
own
hands
,
moving
about
silently
.
<EOS>
As
she
moved
his
eye
followed
her
,
and
when
she
came
behind
his
chair
,
and
pushed
the
decanter
a
little
more
within
his
reach
,
he
put
out
his
rough
,
hairy
hand
,
and
laid
it
upon
one
of
hers
which
she
had
rested
on
the
table
,
with
a
tenderness
that
was
unusual
with
him
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
a
good
girl
,
Kate
.
<EOS>
I
wish
you
had
been
a
boy
,
that
's
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
had
,
I
should
n't
,
perhaps
,
have
been
here
to
take
care
of
you
,
"
she
said
,
smiling
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
you
'd
have
been
like
your
brother
,
no
doubt
.
<EOS>
Not
that
I
think
there
could
have
been
two
so
bad
as
he
is
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
grandfather
,
if
he
has
offended
you
,
you
should
try
to
forgive
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Try
to
forgive
him
!
<EOS>
How
often
have
I
forgiven
him
without
any
trying
?
<EOS>
Why
did
he
come
down
here
the
other
day
,
and
insult
me
for
the
last
time
?
<EOS>
Why
did
n't
he
keep
away
,
as
I
had
bidden
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
gave
him
leave
to
see
you
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
give
him
leave
to
treat
me
like
that
.
<EOS>
Never
mind
;
he
will
find
that
,
old
as
I
am
,
I
can
punish
an
insult
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
n't
done
anything
,
sir
,
to
injure
him
?
"
said
Kate
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
made
another
will
,
that
's
all
.
<EOS>
Do
you
suppose
I
had
that
man
here
all
the
way
from
Penrith
for
nothing
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
it
is
n't
done
yet
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
it
is
done
.
<EOS>
If
I
left
him
the
whole
property
it
would
be
gone
in
two
years
"
time
.
<EOS>
What
's
the
use
of
doing
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
for
his
life
,
sir
!
<EOS>
You
had
promised
him
that
he
should
have
it
for
his
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
dare
you
tell
me
that
?
<EOS>
I
never
promised
him
.
<EOS>
As
my
heir
,
he
would
have
had
it
all
,
if
he
would
have
behaved
himself
with
common
decency
.
<EOS>
Even
though
I
disliked
him
,
as
I
always
have
done
,
he
should
have
had
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
have
taken
it
from
him
altogether
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
answer
no
questions
about
it
,
Kate
.
"
<EOS>
Then
a
fit
of
coughing
came
upon
him
,
his
four
glasses
of
wine
having
been
all
taken
,
and
there
was
no
further
talk
about
business
.
<EOS>
During
the
evening
Kate
read
a
chapter
of
the
Bible
out
loud
.
<EOS>
But
the
Squire
was
very
impatient
under
the
reading
,
and
positively
refused
permission
for
a
second
.
<EOS>
"
There
is
n't
any
good
in
so
much
of
it
,
all
at
once
,
"
he
said
,
using
almost
exactly
the
same
words
which
Kate
had
used
to
him
about
the
port
wine
.
<EOS>
There
may
have
been
good
produced
by
the
small
quantity
to
which
he
listened
,
as
there
is
good
from
the
physic
which
children
take
with
wry
faces
,
most
unwillingly
.
<EOS>
Who
can
say
?
  
<EOS>
For
many
weeks
past
Kate
had
begged
her
uncle
to
allow
the
clergyman
of
Vavasor
to
come
to
him
;
but
he
had
positively
declined
.
<EOS>
The
vicar
was
a
young
man
to
whom
the
living
had
lately
been
given
by
the
Chancellor
,
and
he
had
commenced
his
career
by
giving
instant
offence
to
the
Squire
.
<EOS>
This
vicar
's
predecessor
had
been
an
old
man
,
almost
as
old
as
the
Squire
himself
,
and
had
held
the
living
for
forty
years
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
a
Westmoreland
man
,
had
read
the
prayers
and
preached
his
one
Sunday
sermon
in
a
Westmoreland
dialect
,
getting
through
the
whole
operation
rather
within
an
hour
and
a
quarter
.
<EOS>
He
had
troubled
none
of
his
parishioners
by
much
advice
,
and
had
been
meek
and
obedient
to
the
Squire
.
<EOS>
Knowing
the
country
well
,
and
being
used
to
its
habits
,
he
had
lived
,
and
been
charitable
too
,
on
the
proceeds
of
his
living
,
which
had
never
reached
two
hundred
a
year
.
<EOS>
But
the
new
comer
was
a
close
-
fisted
man
,
with
higher
ideas
of
personal
comfort
,
who
found
it
necessary
to
make
every
penny
go
as
far
as
possible
,
who
made
up
in
preaching
for
what
he
could
not
give
away
in
charity
;
who
established
an
afternoon
service
,
and
who
had
rebuked
the
Squire
for
saying
that
the
doing
so
was
trash
and
nonsense
.
<EOS>
Since
that
the
Squire
had
never
been
inside
the
church
,
except
on
the
occasion
of
Christmas
-
day
.
<EOS>
For
this
,
indeed
,
the
state
of
his
health
gave
ample
excuse
;
but
he
had
positively
refused
to
see
the
vicar
,
though
that
gentleman
had
assiduously
called
,
and
had
at
last
desired
the
servant
to
tell
the
clergyman
not
to
come
again
unless
he
were
sent
for
.
<EOS>
Kate
's
task
was
,
therefore
,
difficult
,
both
as
regarded
the
temporal
and
spiritual
wants
of
her
grandfather
.
  
<EOS>
When
the
reading
was
finished
,
the
old
man
dozed
in
his
chair
for
half
an
hour
.
<EOS>
He
would
not
go
up
to
bed
before
the
enjoyment
of
that
luxury
.
<EOS>
He
was
daily
implored
to
do
so
,
because
that
sleep
in
the
chair
interfered
so
fatally
with
his
chance
of
sleeping
in
bed
.
<EOS>
But
sleep
in
his
chair
he
would
and
did
.
<EOS>
Then
he
woke
,
and
after
a
fit
of
coughing
,
was
induced
,
with
much
ill
-
humour
,
to
go
up
to
his
room
.
<EOS>
Kate
had
never
seen
him
so
weak
.
<EOS>
He
was
hardly
able
,
even
with
her
assistance
and
that
of
the
old
servant
,
to
get
up
the
broad
stairs
.
<EOS>
But
there
was
still
some
power
left
to
him
for
violence
of
language
after
he
got
to
his
room
,
and
he
rated
Kate
and
the
old
woman
loudly
,
because
his
slippers
were
not
in
the
proper
place
.
<EOS>
"
Grandfather
,
"
said
Kate
,
"
would
you
like
me
to
stay
in
the
room
with
you
to
-
night
?
"
<EOS>
He
rated
her
again
for
this
proposition
,
and
then
,
with
assistance
from
the
nurse
,
he
was
gotten
into
bed
and
was
left
alone
.
  
<EOS>
After
that
Kate
went
to
her
own
room
and
wrote
her
letters
.
<EOS>
The
first
she
wrote
was
to
her
aunt
Greenow
.
<EOS>
That
was
easily
enough
written
.
<EOS>
To
Mrs.
Greenow
it
was
not
necessary
that
she
should
say
anything
about
money
.
<EOS>
She
simply
stated
her
belief
that
her
grandfather
's
last
day
was
near
at
hand
,
and
begged
her
aunt
to
come
and
pay
a
last
visit
to
the
old
man
.
<EOS>
"
It
will
be
a
great
comfort
to
me
in
my
distress
,
"
she
said
;
"
and
it
will
be
a
satisfaction
to
you
to
have
seen
your
father
again
.
"
<EOS>
She
knew
that
her
aunt
would
come
,
and
that
task
was
soon
done
.
  
<EOS>
But
her
letter
to
her
brother
was
much
more
difficult
.
<EOS>
What
should
she
tell
him
,
and
what
should
she
not
tell
him
?
<EOS>
She
began
by
describing
her
grandfather
's
state
,
and
by
saying
to
him
,
as
she
had
done
to
Mrs.
Greenow
,
that
she
believed
the
old
man
's
hours
were
well
-
nigh
come
to
a
close
.
<EOS>
She
told
him
that
she
had
asked
her
aunt
to
come
to
her
;
"
not
,
"
she
said
,
"
that
I
think
her
coming
will
be
of
material
service
,
but
I
feel
the
loneliness
of
the
house
will
be
too
much
for
me
at
such
a
time
.
<EOS>
I
must
leave
it
for
you
to
decide
,
"
she
said
,
"
whether
you
had
better
be
here
.
<EOS>
If
anything
should
happen
,
"
 
people
when
writing
such
letters
are
always
afraid
to
speak
of
death
by
its
proper
name
,
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
send
you
a
message
,
and
no
doubt
you
would
come
at
once
.
"
<EOS>
Then
came
the
question
of
the
will
.
<EOS>
Had
it
not
occurred
to
her
that
her
own
interests
were
involved
she
would
have
said
nothing
on
the
subject
;
but
she
feared
her
brother
,
 
feared
even
his
misconstruction
of
her
motives
,
even
though
she
was
willing
to
sacrifice
so
much
on
his
behalf
,
 
and
therefore
she
resolved
to
tell
him
all
that
she
knew
.
<EOS>
He
might
turn
upon
her
hereafter
if
she
did
not
do
so
,
and
accuse
her
of
a
silence
which
had
been
prejudicial
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
So
she
told
it
all
,
and
the
letter
became
long
in
the
telling
.
<EOS>
"
I
write
with
a
heavy
heart
,
"
she
said
,
"
because
I
know
it
will
be
a
great
blow
to
you
.
<EOS>
He
gave
me
to
understand
that
in
this
will
he
left
everything
away
from
you
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
declare
that
he
said
so
directly
.
<EOS>
Indeed
I
can
not
remember
his
words
;
but
that
was
the
impression
he
left
on
me
.
<EOS>
The
day
before
he
had
asked
me
what
I
should
do
if
he
gave
me
the
estate
;
but
of
course
I
treated
that
as
a
joke
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
idea
what
he
put
into
his
will
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
even
attempted
to
guess
.
<EOS>
But
now
I
have
told
you
all
that
I
know
.
<EOS>
"
The
letter
was
a
very
long
one
,
and
was
not
finished
till
late
;
but
when
it
was
completed
she
had
the
two
taken
out
into
the
kitchen
,
as
the
boy
was
to
start
with
them
before
daylight
.
  
<EOS>
Early
on
the
next
morning
she
crept
silently
into
her
grandfather
's
room
,
as
was
her
habit
;
but
he
was
apparently
sleeping
,
and
then
she
crept
back
again
.
<EOS>
The
old
servant
told
her
that
the
Squire
had
been
awake
at
four
,
and
at
five
,
and
at
six
,
and
had
called
for
her
.
<EOS>
Then
he
had
seemed
to
go
to
sleep
.
<EOS>
Four
or
five
times
in
the
course
of
the
morning
<EOS>
Kate
went
into
the
room
,
but
her
grandfather
did
not
notice
her
.
<EOS>
At
last
she
feared
he
might
already
have
passed
away
,
and
she
put
her
hand
upon
his
shoulder
,
and
down
his
arm
.
<EOS>
He
then
gently
touched
her
hand
with
his
,
showing
her
plainly
that
he
was
not
only
alive
,
but
conscious
.
<EOS>
She
then
offered
him
food
,
 
the
thin
porridge
,
 
which
he
was
wo
nt
to
take
,
and
the
medicine
.
<EOS>
She
offered
him
some
wine
too
,
but
he
would
take
nothing
.
  
<EOS>
At
twelve
o'clock
a
letter
was
brought
to
her
,
which
had
come
by
the
post
.
<EOS>
She
saw
that
it
was
from
Alice
,
and
opening
<EOS>
it
found
that
it
was
very
long
.
<EOS>
At
that
moment
she
could
not
read
it
,
but
she
saw
words
in
it
that
made
her
wish
to
know
its
contents
as
quickly
as
possible
.
<EOS>
But
she
could
not
leave
her
grandfather
then
.
<EOS>
At
two
o'clock
the
doctor
came
to
him
,
and
remained
there
till
the
dusk
of
the
evening
had
commenced
.
<EOS>
At
eight
o'clock
the
old
man
was
dead
.
   
<EOS>
Showing
How
Alice
Was
Punished
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
Kate
's
condition
at
the
old
Hall
on
that
night
was
very
sad
.
<EOS>
The
presence
of
death
is
always
a
source
of
sorrow
,
even
though
the
circumstances
of
the
case
are
of
a
kind
to
create
no
agony
of
grief
.
<EOS>
The
old
man
who
had
just
passed
away
up
-
stairs
was
fully
due
to
go
.
<EOS>
He
had
lived
his
span
all
out
,
and
had
himself
known
that
to
die
was
the
one
thing
left
for
him
to
do
.
<EOS>
Kate
also
had
expected
his
death
,
and
had
felt
that
the
time
had
come
in
which
it
would
be
foolish
even
to
wish
that
it
should
be
arrested
.
<EOS>
But
death
close
to
one
is
always
sad
as
it
is
solemn
.
  
<EOS>
And
she
was
quite
alone
at
Vavasor
Hall
.
<EOS>
She
had
no
acquaintance
within
some
miles
of
her
.
<EOS>
From
the
young
vicar
,
though
she
herself
had
not
quarrelled
with
him
,
she
could
receive
no
comfort
,
as
she
hardly
knew
him
;
nor
was
she
of
a
temperament
which
would
dispose
her
to
turn
to
a
clergyman
at
such
a
time
for
comfort
,
unless
to
one
who
might
have
been
an
old
friend
.
<EOS>
Her
aunt
and
brother
would
probably
both
come
to
her
,
but
they
could
hardly
be
with
her
for
a
day
or
two
,
and
during
that
day
or
two
it
would
be
needful
that
orders
should
be
given
which
it
is
disagreeable
for
a
woman
to
have
to
give
.
<EOS>
The
servants
,
moreover
,
in
the
house
were
hardly
fit
to
assist
her
much
.
<EOS>
There
was
an
old
butler
,
or
footman
,
who
had
lived
at
the
Hall
for
more
than
fifty
years
,
but
he
was
crippled
with
rheumatism
,
and
so
laden
with
maladies
,
that
he
rarely
crept
out
of
his
own
room
.
<EOS>
He
was
simply
an
additional
burden
on
the
others
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
boy
who
had
lately
done
all
the
work
which
the
other
should
have
done
,
and
ever
so
much
more
beside
.
<EOS>
There
is
no
knowing
how
much
work
such
a
boy
will
do
when
properly
drilled
,
and
he
was
now
Kate
's
best
minister
in
her
distress
.
<EOS>
There
was
the
old
nurse
,
 
but
she
had
been
simply
good
for
nursing
,
and
there
were
two
rough
Westmoreland
girls
who
called
themselves
cook
and
housemaid
.
  
<EOS>
On
that
first
evening
,
 
the
very
day
on
which
her
grandfather
had
died
,
 
Kate
would
have
been
more
comfortable
had
she
really
found
something
that
she
could
do
.
<EOS>
But
there
was
in
truth
nothing
.
<EOS>
She
hovered
for
an
hour
or
two
in
and
out
of
the
room
,
conscious
of
the
letter
which
she
had
in
her
pocket
,
and
very
desirous
in
heart
of
reading
it
,
but
restrained
by
a
feeling
that
at
such
a
moment
she
ought
to
think
only
of
the
dead
.
<EOS>
In
this
she
was
wrong
.
<EOS>
Let
the
living
think
of
the
dead
,
when
their
thoughts
will
travel
that
way
whether
the
thinker
wish
it
or
no
.
<EOS>
Grief
taken
up
because
grief
is
supposed
to
be
proper
,
is
only
one
degree
better
than
pretended
grief
.
<EOS>
When
one
sees
it
,
one
can
not
but
think
of
the
lady
who
asked
her
friend
,
in
confidence
,
whether
hot
roast
fowl
and
bread
-
sauce
were
compatible
with
the
earliest
state
of
weeds
;
or
of
that
other
lady
,
 
a
royal
lady
<EOS>
she
,
 
who
was
much
comforted
in
the
tedium
of
her
trouble
when
assured
by
one
of
the
lords
about
the
Court
that
piquet
was
mourning
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
late
at
night
,
near
eleven
,
before
Kate
took
out
her
letter
and
read
it
.
<EOS>
As
something
of
my
story
hangs
upon
it
,
I
will
give
it
at
length
,
though
it
was
a
long
letter
.
<EOS>
It
had
been
written
with
great
struggles
,
and
with
many
tears
,
and
<EOS>
Kate
,
as
she
read
it
to
the
end
,
almost
forgot
that
her
grandfather
was
lying
dead
in
the
room
above
her
.
  
<EOS>
Queen
Anne
Street
,
April
,

.
  
<EOS>
DEAREST
KATE
,
  
<EOS>
I
hardly
know
how
to
write
to
you
 
what
I
have
to
tell
,
and
yet
I
must
tell
it
.
<EOS>
I
must
tell
it
to
you
,
but
I
shall
never
repeat
the
story
to
any
one
else
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
written
yesterday
,
when
it
occurred
,
but
I
was
so
ill
that
I
felt
myself
unable
to
make
the
exertion
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
at
one
time
,
after
your
brother
had
left
me
,
I
almost
doubted
whether
I
should
ever
be
able
to
collect
my
thoughts
again
.
<EOS>
My
dismay
was
at
first
<EOS>
so
great
that
my
reason
for
a
time
deserted
me
,
and
I
could
only
sit
and
cry
like
an
idiot
.
  
<EOS>
Dear
Kate
,
I
hope
you
will
not
be
angry
with
me
for
telling
you
.
<EOS>
I
have
endeavoured
to
think
about
it
as
calmly
as
I
can
,
and
I
believe
that
I
have
no
alternative
.
<EOS>
The
fact
that
your
brother
has
quarrelled
with
me
can
not
be
concealed
from
you
,
and
I
must
not
leave
him
to
tell
you
of
the
manner
of
it
.
<EOS>
He
came
to
me
yesterday
in
great
anger
.
<EOS>
His
anger
then
was
nothing
to
what
it
became
afterwards
;
but
even
when
he
first
came
in
he
was
full
of
wrath
.
<EOS>
He
stood
up
before
me
,
and
asked
me
how
it
had
come
to
pass
that
I
had
sent
him
the
money
which
he
had
asked
of
me
through
the
hands
of
Mr.
Grey
.
<EOS>
Of
course
I
had
not
done
this
,
and
so
I
told
him
at
once
.
<EOS>
I
had
spoken
of
the
matter
to
no
one
but
papa
,
and
he
had
managed
it
for
me
.
<EOS>
Even
now
I
know
nothing
of
it
,
and
as
I
have
not
yet
spoken
to
papa
<EOS>
I
can
not
understand
it
.
<EOS>
George
at
once
told
me
that
he
disbelieved
me
,
and
when
I
sat
quiet
under
this
insult
,
he
used
harsher
words
,
and
said
that
I
had
conspired
to
lower
him
before
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
He
then
asked
me
whether
I
loved
him
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
Kate
,
I
must
tell
it
you
all
,
though
it
is
dreadful
to
me
that
I
should
have
to
write
it
.
<EOS>
You
remember
how
it
came
to
pass
when
we
were
in
Westmoreland
together
at
Christmas
?
<EOS>
Do
not
think
that
I
am
blaming
you
,
but
I
was
very
rash
then
in
the
answers
which
I
made
to
him
.
<EOS>
I
thought
that
I
could
be
useful
to
him
as
his
wife
,
and
I
had
told
myself
that
it
would
be
good
that
I
should
be
of
use
in
some
way
.
<EOS>
When
he
asked
me
that
question
yesterday
,
I
sat
silent
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
how
could
I
have
answered
it
in
the
affirmative
,
when
he
had
just
used
such
language
to
me
,
 
while
he
was
standing
opposite
to
me
,
looking
at
me
in
that
way
which
he
has
when
he
is
enraged
?
<EOS>
Then
he
spoke
again
and
demanded
of
me
that
I
should
at
once
send
back
to
Mr.
Grey
all
presents
of
his
which
I
had
kept
,
and
at
the
same
time
took
up
and
threw
across
the
table
on
to
the
sofa
near
me
,
a
little
paper
knife
which
Mr.
Grey
once
gave
me
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
allow
myself
to
be
so
ordered
by
him
;
so
I
said
nothing
,
but
put
the
knife
back
upon
the
table
.
<EOS>
He
then
took
it
again
and
threw
it
beneath
the
grate
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
a
right
to
look
upon
you
as
my
wife
,
"
he
said
,
"
and
,
as
such
,
I
will
not
allow
you
to
keep
that
man
's
things
about
you
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
told
him
then
that
I
should
never
become
his
wife
,
but
though
I
remember
many
of
his
words
,
I
remember
none
of
my
own
.
<EOS>
He
swore
,
I
know
,
with
a
great
oath
,
that
if
I
went
back
a
second
time
from
my
word
to
him
he
would
leave
me
no
peace
,
 
that
he
would
punish
me
for
my
perfidy
with
some
fearful
punishment
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
Kate
,
I
can
not
tell
you
what
he
looked
like
.
<EOS>
He
had
then
come
quite
close
to
me
,
and
I
know
that
I
trembled
before
him
as
though
he
were
going
to
strike
me
.
<EOS>
Of
course
I
said
nothing
.
<EOS>
What
could
I
say
to
a
man
who
behaved
to
me
in
such
a
manner
?
<EOS>
Then
,
as
far
as
I
can
remember
it
,
he
sat
down
and
began
to
talk
about
money
.
<EOS>
I
forget
what
he
said
at
first
,
but
I
know
that
I
assured
him
that
he
might
take
what
he
wanted
so
long
as
enough
was
left
to
prevent
my
being
absolutely
a
burden
on
papa
.
<EOS>
"
That
,
madam
,
is
a
matter
of
course
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
I
remember
those
words
so
well
.
<EOS>
Then
he
explained
that
after
what
had
passed
between
us
,
I
had
no
right
to
ruin
him
by
keeping
back
from
him
money
which
had
been
promised
to
him
,
and
which
was
essential
to
his
success
.
<EOS>
In
this
,
dear
Kate
,
I
think
he
was
mainly
right
.
<EOS>
But
he
could
not
have
been
right
in
putting
it
to
me
in
that
hard
,
cruel
manner
,
especially
as
I
had
never
refused
anything
that
he
had
asked
of
me
in
respect
of
money
.
<EOS>
The
money
he
may
have
while
it
lasts
;
but
then
there
must
be
an
end
of
it
all
between
us
,
even
though
he
should
have
the
power
of
punishing
me
,
as
he
says
he
will
do
.
<EOS>
Punishing
me
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
What
punishment
can
be
so
hard
as
that
which
he
has
already
inflicted
?
  
<EOS>
He
then
desired
me
to
write
a
letter
to
him
which
he
might
show
to
the
lawyer
,
 
to
our
own
lawyer
,
I
think
he
meant
,
 
in
order
that
money
might
be
raised
to
pay
back
what
Mr.
Grey
had
advanced
,
and
give
him
what
he
now
required
.
<EOS>
I
think
he
said
it
was
to
be
five
thousand
pounds
.
<EOS>
When
he
asked
this
I
did
not
move
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
I
was
unable
to
move
.
<EOS>
Then
he
spoke
very
loud
,
and
swore
at
me
again
,
and
brought
me
pen
and
ink
,
demanding
that
I
should
write
the
letter
.
<EOS>
I
was
so
frightened
that
I
thought
of
running
to
the
door
to
escape
,
and
I
would
have
done
so
<EOS>
had
I
not
distrusted
my
own
power
.
<EOS>
Had
it
been
to
save
my
life
<EOS>
I
could
not
have
written
the
letter
.
<EOS>
I
believe
I
was
now
crying
,
 
at
any
rate
I
threw
myself
back
and
covered
my
face
with
my
hands
.
<EOS>
Then
he
came
and
sat
by
me
,
and
took
hold
of
my
arms
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
Kate
;
I
can
not
tell
it
you
all
.
<EOS>
He
put
his
mouth
close
to
my
ear
,
and
said
words
which
were
terrible
,
though
I
did
not
understand
them
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
what
it
was
he
said
,
but
he
was
threatening
me
with
his
anger
if
I
did
not
obey
him
.
<EOS>
Before
he
left
me
,
I
believe
I
found
my
voice
to
tell
him
that
he
should
certainly
have
the
money
which
he
required
.
<EOS>
And
so
he
shall
.
<EOS>
I
will
go
to
Mr.
Round
myself
,
and
insist
on
its
being
done
.
<EOS>
My
money
is
my
own
,
and
I
may
do
with
it
as
I
please
.
<EOS>
But
I
hope
,
 
I
am
obliged
to
hope
,
that
I
may
never
be
made
to
see
my
cousin
again
.
  
<EOS>
I
will
not
pretend
to
express
any
opinion
as
to
the
cause
of
all
this
.
<EOS>
It
is
very
possible
that
you
will
not
believe
all
I
say
,
 
that
you
will
think
that
I
am
mad
and
have
deluded
myself
.
<EOS>
Of
course
your
heart
will
prompt
you
to
accuse
me
rather
than
him
.
<EOS>
If
it
is
so
,
and
if
there
must
therefore
be
a
division
between
us
,
my
grief
will
be
greatly
increased
;
but
I
do
not
know
that
I
can
help
it
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
keep
all
this
back
from
you
.
<EOS>
He
has
cruelly
ill
-
used
me
and
insulted
me
.
<EOS>
He
has
treated
me
as
I
should
have
thought
no
man
could
have
treated
a
woman
.
<EOS>
As
regards
money
,
I
did
all
that
I
could
do
to
show
that
I
trusted
him
thoroughly
,
and
my
confidence
has
only
led
to
suspicion
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
whether
he
understands
that
everything
must
be
over
between
us
;
but
,
if
not
,
I
must
ask
you
to
tell
him
so
.
<EOS>
And
I
must
ask
you
to
explain
to
him
that
he
must
not
come
again
to
Queen
Anne
Street
.
<EOS>
If
he
does
,
nothing
shall
induce
me
to
see
him
.
<EOS>
Tell
him
also
that
the
money
that
he
wants
shall
assuredly
be
sent
to
him
as
soon
as
I
can
make
Mr.
Round
get
it
.
  
<EOS>
Dearest
Kate
,
good
-
bye
.
<EOS>
I
hope
you
will
feel
for
me
.
<EOS>
If
you
do
not
answer
me
I
shall
presume
that
you
think
yourself
bound
to
support
his
side
,
and
to
believe
me
to
have
been
wrong
.
<EOS>
It
will
make
me
very
unhappy
;
but
I
shall
remember
that
you
are
his
sister
,
and
I
shall
not
be
angry
with
you
.
  
<EOS>
Yours
always
affectionately
,
  
ALICE
VAVASOR
.
  
<EOS>
Kate
,
as
she
read
her
letter
through
,
at
first
quickly
,
and
then
very
slowly
,
came
by
degrees
almost
to
forget
that
death
was
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
Her
mind
,
and
heart
,
and
brain
,
were
filled
with
thoughts
and
feelings
that
had
exclusive
reference
to
Alice
and
her
brother
,
and
at
last
she
found
herself
walking
the
room
with
quick
,
impetuous
steps
,
while
her
blood
was
hot
with
indignation
.
  
<EOS>
All
her
sympathies
in
the
matter
were
with
Alice
.
<EOS>
It
never
occurred
to
her
to
disbelieve
a
word
of
the
statement
made
to
her
,
or
to
suggest
to
herself
that
it
had
been
coloured
by
any
fears
or
exaggerations
on
the
part
of
her
correspondent
.
<EOS>
She
knew
that
Alice
was
true
.
<EOS>
And
,
moreover
,
much
as
she
loved
her
brother
,
 
willing
as
she
had
been
and
would
still
be
to
risk
all
that
she
possessed
,
and
herself
also
,
on
his
behalf
,
 
she
knew
that
it
would
be
risking
and
not
trusting
.
<EOS>
She
loved
her
brother
,
such
love
having
come
to
her
by
nature
,
and
having
remained
with
her
from
of
old
;
and
in
his
intellect
she
still
believed
.
<EOS>
But
she
had
ceased
to
have
belief
in
his
conduct
.
<EOS>
She
feared
everything
that
he
might
do
,
and
lived
with
a
consciousness
that
though
she
was
willing
to
connect
all
her
own
fortunes
with
his
,
she
had
much
reason
to
expect
that
she
might
encounter
ruin
in
doing
so
.
<EOS>
Her
sin
had
been
in
this
,
 
that
she
had
been
anxious
to
subject
Alice
to
the
same
danger
,
 
that
she
had
intrigued
,
sometimes
very
meanly
,
to
bring
about
the
object
which
she
had
at
heart
,
 
that
she
had
used
all
her
craft
to
separate
Alice
from
Mr.
Grey
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
it
may
be
alleged
in
her
excuse
that
she
had
thought
,
 
had
hoped
rather
than
thought
,
 
that
the
marriage
which
she
contemplated
would
change
much
in
her
brother
that
was
wrong
,
and
bring
him
into
a
mode
of
life
that
would
not
be
dangerous
.
<EOS>
Might
<EOS>
not
she
and
Alice
together
so
work
upon
him
,
that
he
should
cease
to
stand
ever
on
the
brink
of
some
half
-
seen
precipice
?
<EOS>
To
risk
herself
for
her
brother
was
noble
.
<EOS>
But
when
she
used
her
cunning
in
inducing
her
cousin
to
share
that
risk
she
was
ignoble
.
<EOS>
Of
this
she
had
herself
some
consciousness
,
as
she
walked
up
and
down
the
old
dining
-
room
at
midnight
,
holding
her
cousin
's
letter
in
her
hand
.
  
<EOS>
Her
cheeks
became
tinged
with
shame
as
she
thought
of
the
scene
which
Alice
had
described
,
 
the
toy
thrown
beneath
the
grate
,
the
loud
curses
,
the
whispered
threats
,
which
had
been
more
terrible
than
curses
,
the
demand
for
money
,
made
with
something
worse
than
a
cut
-
throat
's
violence
,
the
strong
man
's
hand
placed
upon
the
woman
's
arm
in
anger
and
in
rage
,
those
eyes
glaring
,
and
the
gaping
horror
of
that
still
raw
cicatrice
,
as
he
pressed
his
face
close
to
that
of
his
victim
!
<EOS>
Not
for
a
moment
did
she
think
of
defending
him
.
<EOS>
She
accused
him
to
herself
vehemently
of
a
sin
over
and
above
those
sins
which
had
filled
Alice
with
dismay
.
<EOS>
He
had
demanded
money
from
the
girl
whom
he
intended
to
marry
!
<EOS>
According
to
Kate
's
idea
,
nothing
could
excuse
or
palliate
this
sin
.
<EOS>
Alice
had
accounted
it
as
nothing
,
 
had
expressed
her
opinion
that
the
demand
was
reasonable
;
 
even
now
,
after
the
ill
-
usage
to
which
she
had
been
subjected
,
she
had
declared
that
the
money
should
be
forthcoming
,
and
given
to
the
man
who
had
treated
her
so
shamefully
.
<EOS>
It
might
be
well
that
Alice
should
so
feel
and
so
act
,
but
it
behoved
Kate
to
feel
and
act
very
differently
.
<EOS>
She
would
tell
her
brother
,
even
in
the
house
of
death
,
should
he
come
there
,
that
his
conduct
was
mean
and
unmanly
.
<EOS>
Kate
was
no
coward
.
<EOS>
She
declared
to
herself
that
she
would
do
this
even
though
he
should
threaten
her
with
all
his
fury
,
 
though
he
should
glare
upon
her
with
all
the
horrors
of
his
countenance
.
  
<EOS>
One
o'clock
,
and
two
o'clock
,
still
found
her
in
the
dark
sombre
parlour
,
every
now
and
then
pacing
the
floor
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
The
fire
had
gone
out
,
and
,
though
it
was
now
the
middle
of
April
,
she
began
to
feel
the
cold
.
<EOS>
But
she
would
not
go
to
bed
before
she
had
written
a
line
to
Alice
.
<EOS>
To
her
brother
a
message
by
telegraph
would
of
course
be
sent
the
next
morning
;
as
also
would
she
send
a
message
to
her
aunt
.
<EOS>
But
to
Alice
she
would
write
,
though
it
might
be
but
a
line
.
<EOS>
Cold
as
she
was
,
she
found
her
pens
and
paper
,
and
wrote
her
letter
that
night
.
<EOS>
It
was
very
short
.
"
<EOS>
Dear
Alice
,
to
-
day
<EOS>
I
received
your
letter
,
and
to
-
day
our
poor
old
grandfather
died
.
<EOS>
Tell
my
uncle
John
,
with
my
love
,
of
his
father
's
death
.
<EOS>
You
will
understand
that
I
can
not
write
much
now
about
that
other
matter
;
but
I
must
tell
you
,
even
at
such
a
moment
as
this
,
that
there
shall
be
no
quarrel
between
you
and
me
.
<EOS>
There
shall
be
none
at
least
on
my
side
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
say
more
till
a
few
days
shall
have
passed
by
.
<EOS>
He
is
lying
up
-
stairs
,
a
corpse
.
<EOS>
I
have
telegraphed
to
George
,
and
I
suppose
he
will
come
down
.
<EOS>
I
think
my
aunt
Greenow
will
come
also
,
as
I
had
written
to
her
before
,
seeing
that
I
wanted
the
comfort
of
having
her
here
.
<EOS>
Uncle
John
will
of
course
come
or
not
as
he
thinks
fitting
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
whether
I
am
in
a
position
to
say
that
I
shall
be
glad
to
see
him
;
but
I
should
be
very
glad
.
<EOS>
He
and
you
will
know
that
I
can
,
as
yet
,
tell
you
nothing
further
.
<EOS>
The
lawyer
is
to
see
the
men
about
the
funeral
.
<EOS>
Nothing
,
I
suppose
,
will
be
done
till
George
comes
.
<EOS>
Your
own
cousin
and
friend
,
KATE
VAVASOR
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
then
she
added
a
line
below
,
"
My
own
Alice
,
 
<EOS>
If
you
will
let
me
,
you
shall
be
my
sister
,
and
be
the
nearest
to
me
and
the
dearest
.
"
  
<EOS>
Alice
,
when
she
received
this
,
was
at
the
first
moment
so
much
struck
,
and
indeed
surprised
,
by
the
tidings
of
her
grandfather
's
death
,
that
she
was
forced
,
in
spite
of
the
still
existing
violence
of
her
own
feelings
,
to
think
and
act
chiefly
with
reference
to
that
event
.
<EOS>
Her
father
had
not
then
left
his
room
.
<EOS>
She
therefore
went
to
him
,
and
handed
him
Kate
's
letter
.
<EOS>
"
Papa
,
"
she
said
,
"
there
is
news
from
Westmoreland
;
bad
news
,
which
you
hardly
expected
yet
.
"
<EOS>
"
My
father
is
dead
,
"
said
John
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
Whereupon
Alice
gave
him
Kate
's
letter
,
that
he
might
read
it
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Of
course
I
shall
go
down
,
"
he
said
,
as
he
came
to
that
part
in
which
Kate
had
spoken
of
him
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Does
she
think
I
shall
not
follow
my
father
to
the
grave
,
because
I
dislike
her
brother
?
<EOS>
What
does
she
mean
by
saying
that
there
shall
be
no
quarrel
between
you
and
her
?
"
<EOS>
"
I
will
explain
that
at
another
time
,
"
said
Alice
.
<EOS>
John
Vavasor
asked
no
further
questions
then
,
but
declared
at
first
that
he
should
go
to
Westmoreland
on
the
following
day
.
<EOS>
Then
he
altered
his
purpose
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
go
by
the
mail
train
to
-
night
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
It
will
be
very
disagreeable
,
but
I
ought
to
be
there
when
the
will
is
opened
.
<EOS>
"
There
was
very
little
more
said
in
Queen
Anne
Street
on
the
subject
till
the
evening
,
 
till
a
few
moments
before
Mr.
Vavasor
left
his
house
.
<EOS>
He
indeed
had
thought
nothing
more
about
that
quarrelling
,
or
rather
that
promise
that
there
should
be
no
quarrelling
,
between
the
girls
.
<EOS>
He
still
regarded
his
nephew
George
as
the
man
who
,
unfortunately
,
was
to
be
his
son
-
in
-
law
,
and
now
,
during
this
tedious
sad
day
,
in
which
he
felt
himself
compelled
to
remain
at
home
,
he
busied
his
mind
in
thinking
of
George
and
Alice
,
as
living
together
at
the
old
Hall
.
<EOS>
At
six
,
the
father
and
daughter
dined
,
and
soon
after
dinner
Mr.
Vavasor
went
up
to
his
own
room
to
prepare
himself
for
his
journey
.
<EOS>
After
a
while
Alice
followed
him
,
 
but
she
did
not
do
so
till
she
knew
that
if
anything
was
to
be
told
before
the
journey
no
further
time
could
be
lost
.
<EOS>
"
Papa
,
"
she
said
,
as
soon
as
she
had
shut
the
door
behind
her
,
"
I
think
I
ought
to
tell
you
before
you
go
that
everything
is
over
between
me
and
George
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Have
you
quarrelled
with
him
too
?
"
said
her
father
,
with
uncontrolled
surprise
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
perhaps
say
that
he
has
quarrelled
with
me
.
<EOS>
But
,
dear
papa
,
pray
do
not
question
me
at
present
.
<EOS>
I
will
tell
you
all
when
you
come
back
,
but
I
thought
it
right
that
you
should
know
this
before
you
went
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
has
been
his
doing
then
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
explain
it
to
you
in
a
hurry
like
this
.
<EOS>
Papa
,
you
may
understand
something
of
the
shame
which
I
feel
,
and
you
should
not
question
me
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
John
Grey
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
nothing
different
in
regard
to
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
be
shot
if
I
can
understand
you
.
<EOS>
George
,
you
know
,
has
had
two
thousand
pounds
of
your
money
,
 
of
yours
or
somebody
else
's
.
<EOS>
Well
,
we
ca
n't
talk
about
it
now
,
as
I
must
be
off
.
<EOS>
Thinking
as
I
do
of
George
,
I
'm
glad
of
it
,
 
<EOS>
that
's
all
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Then
he
went
,
and
Alice
was
left
alone
,
to
comfort
herself
as
best
she
might
by
her
own
reflections
.
  
<EOS>
George
Vavasor
had
received
the
message
on
the
day
previous
to
that
on
which
Alice
's
letter
had
reached
her
,
but
it
had
not
come
to
him
till
late
in
the
day
.
<EOS>
He
might
have
gone
down
by
the
mail
train
of
that
night
,
but
there
were
one
or
two
persons
,
his
own
attorney
especially
,
whom
he
wished
to
see
before
the
reading
of
his
grandfather
's
will
.
<EOS>
He
remained
in
town
,
therefore
,
on
the
following
day
,
and
went
down
by
the
same
train
as
that
which
took
his
uncle
.
<EOS>
Walking
along
the
platform
,
looking
for
a
seat
,
he
peered
into
a
carriage
and
met
his
uncle
's
eye
.
<EOS>
The
two
saw
each
other
,
but
did
not
speak
,
and
George
passed
on
to
another
carriage
.
<EOS>
On
the
following
morning
,
before
the
break
of
day
,
they
met
again
in
the
refreshment
room
,
at
the
station
at
Lancaster
.
"
<EOS>
So
my
father
has
gone
,
George
,
"
said
the
uncle
,
speaking
to
the
nephew
.
<EOS>
They
must
go
to
the
same
house
,
and
Mr.
Vavasor
felt
that
it
would
be
better
that
they
should
be
on
speaking
terms
when
they
reached
it
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
"
said
George
;
"
he
has
gone
at
last
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
what
we
shall
find
to
have
been
his
latest
act
of
injustice
.
<EOS>
"
The
reader
will
remember
that
he
had
received
Kate
's
first
letter
,
in
which
she
had
told
him
of
the
Squire
's
altered
will
.
<EOS>
John
Vavasor
turned
away
disgusted
.
<EOS>
His
finer
feelings
were
perhaps
not
very
strong
,
but
he
had
no
thoughts
or
hopes
in
reference
to
the
matter
which
were
mean
.
<EOS>
He
expected
nothing
himself
,
and
did
not
begrudge
his
nephew
the
inheritance
.
<EOS>
At
this
moment
he
was
thinking
of
the
old
Squire
as
a
father
who
had
ever
been
kind
to
him
.
<EOS>
It
might
be
natural
that
George
should
have
no
such
old
affection
at
his
heart
,
but
it
was
unnatural
that
he
should
express
himself
as
he
had
done
at
such
a
moment
.
  
<EOS>
The
uncle
turned
away
,
but
said
nothing
.
<EOS>
George
followed
him
with
a
little
proposition
of
his
own
.
<EOS>
"
We
sha
n't
get
any
conveyance
at
Shap
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
Had
n't
we
better
go
over
in
a
chaise
from
Kendal
?
"
<EOS>
To
this
the
uncle
assented
,
and
so
they
finished
their
journey
together
.
<EOS>
George
smoked
all
the
time
that
they
were
in
the
carriage
,
and
very
few
words
were
spoken
.
<EOS>
As
they
drove
up
to
the
old
house
,
they
found
that
another
arrival
had
taken
place
before
them
,
 
Mrs.
Greenow
having
reached
the
house
in
some
vehicle
from
the
Shap
station
.
<EOS>
She
had
come
across
from
Norwich
to
Manchester
,
where
she
had
joined
the
train
which
had
brought
the
uncle
and
nephew
from
London
.
   
<EOS>
The
Will
.
 
<EOS>
The
coming
of
Mrs.
Greenow
at
this
very
moment
was
a
great
comfort
to
Kate
.
<EOS>
Without
her
she
would
hardly
have
known
how
to
bear
herself
with
her
uncle
and
her
brother
.
<EOS>
As
it
was
,
they
were
all
restrained
by
something
of
the
courtesy
which
strangers
are
bound
to
show
to
each
other
.
<EOS>
George
had
never
seen
his
aunt
since
he
was
a
child
,
and
some
sort
of
introduction
was
necessary
between
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
you
are
George
,
"
said
Mrs.
Greenow
,
putting
out
her
hand
and
smiling
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
I
'm
George
,
"
said
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
a
Member
of
Parliament
!
"
said
Mrs.
Greenow
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
quite
an
honour
to
the
family
.
<EOS>
I
felt
so
proud
when
I
heard
it
!
"
<EOS>
She
said
this
pleasantly
,
meaning
it
to
be
taken
for
truth
,
and
then
turned
away
to
her
brother
.
<EOS>
"
Papa
's
time
was
fully
come
,
"
she
said
,
"
though
,
to
tell
the
truth
,
I
had
no
idea
that
he
was
so
weak
as
Kate
describes
him
to
have
been
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Nor
I
,
either
,
"
said
John
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
"
He
went
to
church
with
us
here
on
Christmas
-
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
he
,
indeed
?
<EOS>
Dear
,
dear
!
<EOS>
He
seems
at
last
to
have
gone
off
just
like
poor
Greenow
.
<EOS>
"
Here
she
put
her
handkerchief
up
to
her
face
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
did
n't
know
Greenow
,
John
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
met
him
once
,
"
said
her
brother
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
he
was
n't
to
be
known
and
understood
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
I
'm
aware
there
was
a
little
prejudice
,
because
of
his
being
in
trade
,
but
we
wo
n't
talk
of
that
now
.
<EOS>
Where
should
I
have
been
without
him
,
tradesman
or
no
tradesman
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
've
no
doubt
he
was
an
excellent
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
may
say
that
,
John
.
<EOS>
Ah
,
well
!
<EOS>
we
ca
n't
keep
everything
in
this
life
for
ever
.
<EOS>
"
It
may
,
perhaps
,
be
as
well
to
explain
now
that
Mrs.
Greenow
had
told
Captain
Bellfield
at
their
last
meeting
before
she
left
Norwich
,
that
,
under
certain
circumstances
,
if
he
behaved
himself
well
,
there
might
possibly
be
ground
of
hope
.
<EOS>
Whereupon
Captain
Bellfield
had
immediately
gone
to
the
best
tailor
in
that
city
,
had
told
the
man
of
his
coming
marriage
,
and
had
given
an
extensive
order
.
<EOS>
But
the
tailor
had
not
as
yet
supplied
the
goods
,
waiting
for
more
credible
evidence
of
the
Captain
's
good
fortune
.
<EOS>
"
We
're
all
grass
of
the
field
,
"
said
Mrs.
Greenow
,
lightly
brushing
a
tear
from
her
eye
,
"
and
must
be
cut
down
and
put
into
the
oven
in
our
turns
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Her
brother
uttered
a
slight
sympathetic
groan
,
shaking
his
head
in
testimony
of
the
uncertainty
of
human
affairs
,
and
then
said
that
he
would
go
out
and
look
about
the
place
.
<EOS>
George
,
in
the
meantime
,
had
asked
his
sister
to
show
him
his
room
,
and
the
two
were
already
together
up
-
stairs
.
  
<EOS>
Kate
had
made
up
her
mind
that
she
would
say
nothing
about
Alice
at
the
present
moment
,
 
nothing
,
if
it
could
be
avoided
,
till
after
the
funeral
.
<EOS>
She
led
the
way
up
-
stairs
,
almost
trembling
with
fear
,
for
she
knew
that
that
other
subject
of
the
will
would
also
give
rise
to
trouble
and
sorrow
,
 
perhaps
,
also
,
to
determined
quarrelling
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
has
brought
that
woman
here
?
<EOS>
"
was
the
first
question
that
George
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
asked
her
to
come
,
"
said
Kate
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
why
did
you
ask
her
to
come
here
?
"
said
George
,
angrily
.
<EOS>
Kate
immediately
felt
that
he
was
speaking
as
though
he
were
master
of
the
house
,
and
also
as
though
he
intended
to
be
master
of
her
.
<EOS>
As
regarded
the
former
idea
,
she
had
no
objection
to
it
.
<EOS>
She
thoroughly
and
honestly
wished
that
he
might
be
the
master
;
and
though
she
feared
that
he
might
find
himself
mistaken
in
his
assumption
,
she
herself
was
not
disposed
to
deny
any
appearance
of
right
that
he
might
take
upon
himself
in
that
respect
.
<EOS>
But
she
had
already
begun
to
tell
herself
that
she
must
not
submit
herself
to
his
masterdom
.
<EOS>
She
had
gradually
so
taught
herself
since
he
had
compelled
her
to
write
the
first
letter
in
which
Alice
had
been
asked
to
give
her
money
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
asked
her
,
George
,
before
my
poor
grandfather
's
death
,
when
I
thought
that
he
would
linger
perhaps
for
weeks
.
<EOS>
My
life
here
alone
with
him
,
without
any
other
woman
in
the
house
beside
the
servants
,
was
very
melancholy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
did
you
not
ask
Alice
to
come
to
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Alice
could
not
have
come
,
"
said
Kate
,
after
a
short
pause
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
why
she
should
n't
have
come
.
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
have
that
woman
about
the
place
.
<EOS>
She
disgraced
herself
by
marrying
a
blacksmith
 
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
George
,
it
was
you
yourself
who
advised
me
to
go
and
stay
with
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
a
very
different
thing
.
<EOS>
Now
that
he
's
dead
,
and
she
's
got
his
money
,
it
's
all
very
well
that
you
should
go
to
her
occasionally
;
but
I
wo
n't
have
her
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
natural
that
she
should
come
to
her
father
's
house
at
her
father
's
death
-
bed
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hate
to
be
told
that
things
are
natural
.
<EOS>
It
always
means
humbug
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
suppose
she
cared
for
the
old
man
any
more
than
I
did
,
 
or
than
she
cared
for
the
other
old
man
who
married
her
.
<EOS>
People
are
such
intense
hypocrites
.
<EOS>
There
's
my
uncle
John
,
pulling
a
long
face
because
he
has
come
into
this
house
,
and
he
will
pull
it
as
long
as
the
body
lies
up
there
;
and
yet
for
the
last
twenty
years
there
's
nothing
on
earth
he
has
so
much
hated
as
going
to
see
his
father
.
<EOS>
When
are
they
going
to
bury
him
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
On
Saturday
,
the
day
after
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
could
n't
they
do
it
to
-
morrow
,
so
that
we
could
get
away
before
Sunday
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
only
died
on
Monday
,
George
,
"
said
Kate
,
solemnly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Psha
!
<EOS>
Who
has
got
the
will
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Gogram
.
<EOS>
He
was
here
yesterday
,
and
told
me
to
tell
you
and
uncle
John
that
he
would
have
it
with
him
when
he
came
back
from
the
funeral
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
has
my
uncle
John
to
do
with
it
?
"
said
George
,
sharply
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
go
over
to
Penrith
this
afternoon
and
make
Gogram
give
it
up
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
he
'll
do
that
,
George
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
right
has
he
to
keep
it
?
<EOS>
What
right
has
he
to
it
at
all
?
<EOS>
How
do
I
know
that
he
has
really
got
the
old
man
's
last
will
?
<EOS>
Where
did
my
grandfather
keep
his
papers
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
In
that
old
secretary
,
as
he
used
to
call
it
;
the
one
that
stands
in
the
dining
-
room
.
<EOS>
It
is
sealed
up
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Who
sealed
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Gogram
did
,
 
Mr.
Gogram
and
I
together
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
the
deuce
made
you
meddle
with
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
merely
assisted
him
.
<EOS>
But
I
believe
he
was
quite
right
.
<EOS>
I
think
it
is
usual
in
such
cases
.

Balderdash
!
<EOS>
You
are
thinking
of
some
old
trumpery
of
former
days
.
<EOS>
Till
I
know
to
the
contrary
,
everything
here
belongs
to
me
as
heir
-
at
-
law
,
and
I
do
not
mean
to
allow
of
any
interference
till
I
know
for
certain
that
my
rights
have
been
taken
from
me
.
<EOS>
And
I
wo
n't
accept
a
death
-
bed
will
.
<EOS>
What
a
man
chooses
to
write
when
his
fingers
will
hardly
hold
the
pen
,
goes
for
nothing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
ca
n't
suppose
that
I
wish
to
interfere
with
your
rights
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
not
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
George
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
;
I
say
,
I
hope
not
.
<EOS>
But
I
know
there
are
those
who
would
.
<EOS>
Do
you
think
my
uncle
John
would
not
interfere
with
me
if
he
could
?
<EOS>
By
 
---
!
if
he
does
,
he
shall
find
that
he
does
it
to
his
cost
.
<EOS>
I
'll
lead
him
such
a
life
through
the
courts
,
for
the
next
two
or
three
years
,
that
he
'll
wish
that
he
had
remained
in
Chancery
Lane
,
and
had
never
left
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
A
message
was
now
brought
up
by
the
nurse
,
saying
that
Mrs.
Greenow
and
Mr.
Vavasor
were
going
into
the
room
where
the
old
Squire
was
lying
,
"
<EOS>
Would
Miss
Kate
and
Mr.
George
go
with
them
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Vavasor
!
"
shouted
out
George
,
making
the
old
woman
jump
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
understand
his
meaning
in
the
least
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
sir
;
the
old
Squire
,
"
she
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
come
,
George
?
"
<EOS>
Kate
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
what
should
I
go
there
for
?
<EOS>
Why
should
I
pretend
an
interest
in
the
dead
body
of
a
man
whom
I
hated
and
who
hated
me
;
 
whose
very
last
act
,
as
far
as
I
know
as
yet
,
was
an
attempt
to
rob
me
?
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
go
and
see
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Kate
went
,
and
was
glad
of
an
opportunity
of
getting
away
from
her
brother
.
<EOS>
Every
hour
the
idea
was
becoming
stronger
in
her
mind
that
she
must
in
some
way
separate
herself
from
him
.
<EOS>
There
had
come
upon
him
of
late
a
hard
ferocity
which
made
him
unendurable
.
<EOS>
And
then
he
carried
to
such
a
pitch
that
hatred
,
as
he
called
it
,
of
conventional
rules
,
that
he
allowed
himself
to
be
controlled
by
none
of
the
ordinary
bonds
of
society
.
<EOS>
She
had
felt
this
heretofore
,
with
a
nervous
consciousness
that
she
was
doing
wrong
in
endeavouring
to
bring
about
a
marriage
between
him
and
Alice
;
but
this
demeanour
and
mode
of
talking
had
now
so
grown
upon
him
that
Kate
began
to
feel
herself
thankful
that
Alice
had
been
saved
.
  
<EOS>
Kate
went
up
with
her
uncle
and
aunt
,
and
saw
the
face
of
her
grandfather
for
the
last
time
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Poor
,
dear
old
man
!
"
said
Mrs.
Greenow
,
as
the
easy
tears
ran
down
her
face
.
<EOS>
"
Do
you
remember
,
John
,
how
he
used
to
scold
me
,
and
say
that
I
should
never
come
to
good
.
<EOS>
He
has
said
the
same
thing
to
you
,
Kate
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
He
has
been
very
kind
to
me
,
"
said
Kate
,
standing
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
.
<EOS>
She
was
not
one
of
those
whose
tears
stand
near
their
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
was
a
fine
old
gentleman
,
"
said
John
Vavasor
;
 
"
belonging
to
days
that
are
now
gone
by
,
but
by
no
means
the
less
of
a
gentleman
on
that
account
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
that
he
ever
did
an
unjust
or
ungenerous
act
to
any
one
.
<EOS>
Come
,
Kate
,
we
may
as
well
go
down
.
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Greenow
lingered
to
say
a
word
or
two
to
the
nurse
,
of
the
manner
in
which
Greenow
's
body
was
treated
when
Greenow
was
lying
dead
,
and
then
she
followed
her
brother
and
niece
.
  
<EOS>
George
did
not
go
into
Penrith
,
nor
did
he
see
Mr.
Gogram
till
that
worthy
attorney
came
out
to
Vavasor
Hall
on
the
morning
of
the
funeral
.
<EOS>
He
said
nothing
more
on
the
subject
,
nor
did
he
break
the
seals
on
the
old
upright
desk
that
stood
in
the
parlour
.
<EOS>
The
two
days
before
the
funeral
were
very
wretched
for
all
the
party
,
except
,
perhaps
,
for
Mrs.
Greenow
,
who
affected
not
to
understand
that
her
nephew
was
in
a
bad
humour
.
<EOS>
She
called
him
"
poor
George
,
"
and
treated
all
his
incivility
to
herself
as
though
it
were
the
effect
of
his
grief
.
<EOS>
She
asked
him
questions
about
Parliament
,
which
,
of
course
,
he
did
n't
answer
,
and
told
him
little
stories
about
poor
dear
Greenow
,
not
heeding
his
expressions
of
unmistakable
disgust
.
  
<EOS>
The
two
days
at
last
went
by
,
and
the
hour
of
the
funeral
came
.
<EOS>
There
was
the
doctor
and
Gogram
,
and
the
uncle
and
the
nephew
,
to
follow
the
corpse
,
 
the
nephew
taking
upon
himself
ostentatiously
<EOS>
the
foremost
place
,
as
though
he
could
thereby
help
to
maintain
his
pretensions
as
heir
.
<EOS>
The
clergyman
met
them
at
the
little
wicket
-
gate
of
the
churchyard
,
having
,
by
some
reasoning
,
which
we
hope
was
satisfactory
to
himself
,
overcome
a
resolution
which
he
at
first
formed
,
that
he
would
not
read
the
burial
service
over
an
unrepentant
sinner
.
<EOS>
But
he
did
read
it
,
having
mentioned
his
scruples
to
none
but
one
confidential
clerical
friend
in
the
same
diocese
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
told
that
you
have
got
my
grandfather
's
will
,
"
George
said
to
the
attorney
as
soon
as
he
saw
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
it
in
my
pocket
,
"
said
Mr.
Gogram
,
"
and
purpose
to
read
it
as
soon
as
we
return
from
church
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
it
usual
to
take
a
will
away
from
a
man
's
house
in
that
way
?
"
<EOS>
George
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
Quite
usual
,
"
said
the
attorney
;
"
and
in
this
case
it
was
done
at
the
express
desire
of
the
testator
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
is
the
common
practice
,
"
said
John
Vavasor
.
  
<EOS>
George
upon
this
turned
round
at
his
uncle
as
though
about
to
attack
him
,
but
he
restrained
himself
and
said
nothing
,
though
he
showed
his
teeth
.
  
<EOS>
The
funeral
was
very
plain
,
and
not
a
word
was
spoken
by
George
Vavasor
during
the
journey
there
and
back
.
<EOS>
John
Vavasor
asked
a
few
questions
of
the
doctor
as
to
the
last
weeks
of
his
father
's
life
;
and
it
was
incidentally
mentioned
,
both
by
the
doctor
and
by
the
attorney
,
that
the
old
Squire
's
intellect
had
remained
unimpaired
up
to
the
last
moment
that
he
had
been
seen
by
either
of
them
.
<EOS>
When
they
returned
to
the
hall
Mrs.
Greenow
met
them
with
an
invitation
to
lunch
.
<EOS>
They
all
went
to
the
dining
-
room
,
and
drank
each
a
glass
of
sherry
.
<EOS>
George
took
two
or
three
glasses
.
<EOS>
The
doctor
then
withdrew
,
and
drove
himself
back
to
Penrith
,
where
he
lived
.
  
<EOS>
"
Shall
we
go
into
the
other
room
now
?
"
said
the
attorney
.
  
<EOS>
The
three
gentlemen
then
rose
up
,
and
went
across
to
the
drawing
-
room
,
George
leading
the
way
.
<EOS>
The
attorney
followed
him
,
and
John
Vavasor
closed
the
door
behind
them
.
<EOS>
Had
any
observer
been
there
to
watch
them
he
might
have
seen
by
the
faces
of
the
two
latter
that
they
expected
an
unpleasant
meeting
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Gogram
,
as
he
had
walked
across
the
hall
,
had
pulled
a
document
out
of
his
pocket
,
and
held
it
in
his
hand
as
he
took
a
chair
.
<EOS>
John
Vavasor
stood
behind
one
of
the
chairs
which
had
been
placed
at
the
table
,
and
leaned
upon
it
,
looking
across
the
room
,
up
at
the
ceiling
.
<EOS>
George
stood
on
the
rug
before
the
fire
,
with
his
hands
in
the
pockets
of
his
trousers
,
and
his
coat
tails
over
his
arms
.
  
<EOS>
"
Gentlemen
,
will
you
sit
down
?
"
said
Mr.
Gogram
.
  
<EOS>
John
Vavasor
immediately
sat
down
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
prefer
to
stand
here
,
"
said
George
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Gogram
then
opened
the
document
before
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Before
that
paper
is
read
,
"
said
George
,
"
I
think
it
right
to
say
a
few
words
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
what
it
contains
,
but
I
believe
it
to
have
been
executed
by
my
grandfather
only
an
hour
or
two
before
his
death
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
On
the
day
before
he
died
,
 
early
in
the
day
,
"
said
the
attorney
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
 
the
day
before
he
died
;
it
is
the
same
thing
,
 
while
he
was
dying
,
in
fact
.
<EOS>
He
never
got
out
of
bed
afterwards
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
was
not
in
bed
at
the
time
,
Mr.
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
Not
that
it
would
have
mattered
if
he
had
been
.
<EOS>
And
he
came
down
to
dinner
on
that
day
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
understand
,
however
,
why
you
make
these
observations
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
'll
listen
to
me
you
will
understand
.
<EOS>
I
make
them
because
I
deny
my
grandfather
's
fitness
to
make
a
will
in
the
last
moments
of
his
existence
,
and
at
such
an
age
.
<EOS>
I
saw
him
a
few
weeks
ago
,
and
he
was
not
fit
to
be
trusted
with
the
management
of
property
then
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
this
is
the
time
,
George
,
to
put
forward
such
objections
,
"
said
the
uncle
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
is
,
"
said
George
.
<EOS>
"
I
believe
that
that
paper
purports
to
be
an
instrument
by
which
I
should
be
villanously
defrauded
if
it
were
allowed
to
be
held
as
good
.
<EOS>
Therefore
I
protest
against
it
now
,
and
shall
question
it
at
law
if
action
be
taken
on
it
.
<EOS>
You
can
read
it
now
,
if
you
please
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
yes
,
I
shall
read
,
"
said
Mr.
Gogram
;
"
and
I
say
that
it
is
as
valid
a
will
as
ever
a
man
signed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
say
it
's
not
.
<EOS>
That
's
the
difference
between
us
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
will
was
read
amidst
sundry
interjections
and
expressions
of
anger
from
George
,
which
it
is
not
necessary
to
repeat
.
<EOS>
Nor
need
I
trouble
my
readers
with
the
will
at
length
.
<EOS>
It
began
by
expressing
the
testator
's
great
desire
that
his
property
might
descend
in
his
own
family
,
and
that
the
house
might
be
held
and
inhabited
by
some
one
bearing
the
name
of
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
He
then
declared
that
he
felt
himself
obliged
to
pass
over
his
natural
heir
,
believing
that
the
property
would
not
be
safe
in
his
hands
;
he
therefore
left
it
in
trust
to
his
son
John
Vavasor
,
whom
he
appointed
to
be
sole
executor
of
his
will
.
<EOS>
He
devised
it
to
George
's
eldest
son
,
 
should
George
ever
marry
and
have
a
son
,
 
as
soon
as
he
might
reach
the
age
of
twenty
-
five
.
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
the
property
should
remain
in
the
hands
of
John
Vavasor
for
his
use
and
benefit
,
with
a
lien
on
it
of
five
hundred
a
year
to
be
paid
annually
to
his
granddaughter
Kate
.
<EOS>
In
the
event
of
George
having
no
son
,
the
property
was
to
go
to
the
eldest
son
of
Kate
,
or
failing
that
to
the
eldest
son
of
his
other
granddaughter
who
might
take
the
name
of
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
All
his
personal
property
he
left
to
his
son
,
John
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
,
Mr.
Vavasor
,
"
said
the
attorney
,
as
he
finished
his
reading
,
"
you
will
,
I
fear
,
get
very
little
by
that
latter
clause
.
<EOS>
The
estate
now
owes
nothing
;
but
I
doubt
whether
the
Squire
had
fifty
pounds
in
his
banker
's
hands
when
he
died
,
and
the
value
of
the
property
about
the
place
is
very
small
.
<EOS>
He
has
been
unwilling
to
spend
anything
during
the
last
ten
years
,
but
has
paid
off
every
shilling
that
the
property
owed
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
as
I
supposed
,
"
said
George
.
<EOS>
His
voice
was
very
unpleasant
,
and
so
was
the
fire
of
his
eyes
and
the
ghastly
rage
of
his
scarred
face
.
<EOS>
"
The
old
man
has
endeavoured
in
his
anger
to
rob
me
of
everything
because
I
would
not
obey
him
in
his
wickedness
when
I
was
here
with
him
a
short
while
before
he
died
.
<EOS>
Such
a
will
as
that
can
stand
nowhere
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
As
to
that
I
have
nothing
to
say
at
present
,
"
said
the
attorney
.
  
<EOS>
"
Where
is
his
other
will
,
 
the
one
he
made
before
that
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
remember
rightly
we
executed
two
before
this
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
where
are
they
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
my
business
to
know
,
Mr.
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
I
believe
that
I
saw
him
destroy
one
,
but
I
have
no
absolute
knowledge
.
<EOS>
As
to
the
other
,
I
can
say
nothing
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
do
you
mean
to
do
?
"
said
George
,
turning
to
his
uncle
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
!
<EOS>
I
shall
carry
out
the
will
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
alternative
.
<EOS>
Your
sister
is
the
person
chiefly
interested
under
it
.
<EOS>
She
gets
five
hundred
a
year
for
her
life
;
and
if
she
marries
and
you
do
n't
,
or
if
she
has
a
son
and
you
do
n't
,
her
son
will
have
the
whole
property
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
George
stood
for
a
few
moments
thinking
.
<EOS>
Might
it
not
be
possible
that
by
means
of
Alice
and
Kate
together
,
 
by
marrying
the
former
,
 
perhaps
,
he
might
still
obtain
possession
of
the
property
?
<EOS>
But
that
which
he
wanted
was
the
command
of
the
property
at
once
,
 
the
power
of
raising
money
upon
it
instantly
.
<EOS>
The
will
had
been
so
framed
as
to
make
that
impossible
in
any
way
.
<EOS>
Kate
's
share
in
it
had
not
been
left
to
her
unconditionally
,
but
was
to
be
received
even
by
her
through
the
hands
of
her
uncle
John
.
<EOS>
Such
a
will
shut
him
out
from
all
his
hopes
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
piece
of
d
 
---
roguery
,
"
he
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
by
that
,
sir
?
"
said
Gogram
,
turning
round
towards
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
mean
exactly
what
I
say
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
piece
of
d
 
---
roguery
.
<EOS>
Who
was
in
the
room
when
that
thing
was
written
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
signature
was
witnessed
by
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
do
n't
ask
as
to
the
signature
.
<EOS>
Who
was
in
the
room
when
the
thing
was
written
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
here
with
your
grandfather
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
no
one
else
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
No
one
else
.
<EOS>
The
presence
of
any
one
else
at
such
a
time
would
be
very
unusual
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
I
regard
the
document
simply
as
waste
paper
.
"
<EOS>
After
saying
this
,
George
Vavasor
left
the
room
,
and
slammed
the
door
after
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
was
insulted
in
such
a
way
before
,
"
said
the
attorney
,
almost
with
tears
in
his
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
a
disappointed
and
I
fear
a
ruined
man
,
"
said
John
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
you
need
regard
what
he
says
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
But
he
should
not
on
that
account
insult
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
only
done
my
duty
.
<EOS>
I
did
not
even
advise
his
grandfather
.
<EOS>
It
is
mean
on
his
part
and
unmanly
.
<EOS>
If
he
comes
in
my
way
again
I
shall
tell
him
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
He
probably
will
not
put
himself
in
your
way
again
,
Mr.
Gogram
.
"
  
<EOS>
Then
the
attorney
went
,
having
suggested
to
Mr.
Vavasor
that
he
should
instruct
his
attorney
in
London
to
take
steps
in
reference
to
the
proving
of
the
will
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
as
good
a
will
as
ever
was
made
,
"
said
Mr.
Gogram
.
<EOS>
"
If
he
can
set
that
aside
,
I
'll
give
up
making
wills
altogether
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Who
was
to
tell
Kate
?
<EOS>
That
was
John
Vavasor
's
first
thought
when
he
was
left
alone
at
the
hall
-
door
,
after
seeing
the
lawyer
start
away
.
<EOS>
And
how
was
he
to
get
himself
back
to
London
without
further
quarrelling
with
his
nephew
?
<EOS>
And
what
was
he
to
do
at
once
with
reference
to
the
immediate
duties
of
proprietorship
which
were
entailed
upon
him
as
executor
?
<EOS>
It
was
by
no
means
improbable
,
as
he
thought
,
that
George
might
assume
to
himself
the
position
of
master
of
the
house
;
that
he
might
demand
the
keys
,
for
instance
,
which
no
doubt
were
in
Kate
's
hands
at
present
,
and
that
he
would
take
possession
with
violence
.
<EOS>
What
should
he
do
under
such
circumstances
?
<EOS>
It
was
clear
that
he
could
not
run
away
and
get
back
to
his
club
by
the
night
mail
train
.
<EOS>
He
had
duties
there
at
the
Hall
,
and
these
duties
were
of
a
nature
to
make
him
almost
regret
the
position
in
which
his
father
's
will
had
placed
him
.
<EOS>
Eventually
he
would
gain
some
considerable
increase
to
his
means
,
but
the
immediate
effect
would
be
terribly
troublesome
.
<EOS>
As
he
looked
up
at
the
melancholy
pines
which
were
slowly
waving
their
heads
in
the
wind
before
the
door
he
declared
to
himself
that
he
would
sell
his
inheritance
and
his
executorship
very
cheaply
,
if
such
a
sale
were
possible
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
dining
-
room
he
found
his
sister
alone
.
"
<EOS>
Well
,
John
,
"
said
she
;
"
<EOS>
well
?
<EOS>
How
is
it
left
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Where
is
Kate
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
has
gone
out
with
her
brother
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
he
take
his
hat
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
yes
.
<EOS>
He
asked
her
to
walk
,
and
she
went
with
him
at
once
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
,
I
suppose
,
he
will
tell
her
,
"
said
John
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
After
that
he
explained
the
circumstances
of
the
will
to
Mrs.
Greenow
.
<EOS>
"
Bravo
,
"
exclaimed
the
widow
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
delighted
.
<EOS>
I
love
Kate
dearly
:
and
now
she
can
marry
almost
whom
she
pleases
.
"
   
<EOS>
Another
Walk
on
the
Fells
.
 
<EOS>
George
when
he
left
the
room
in
which
he
had
insulted
the
lawyer
,
went
immediately
across
to
the
parlour
in
which
his
aunt
and
sister
were
sitting
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Kate
,
"
said
he
,
"
put
on
your
hat
and
come
and
walk
with
me
.
<EOS>
That
business
is
over
.
"
<EOS>
Kate
's
hat
and
shawl
were
in
the
room
,
and
they
were
out
of
the
house
together
within
a
minute
.
  
<EOS>
They
walked
down
the
carriage
-
road
,
through
the
desolate
,
untenanted
grounds
,
to
the
gate
,
before
either
of
them
spoke
a
word
.
<EOS>
Kate
was
waiting
for
George
to
tell
her
of
the
will
,
but
did
not
dare
to
ask
any
question
.
<EOS>
George
intended
to
tell
her
of
the
will
,
but
was
not
disposed
to
do
so
without
some
preparation
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
thing
not
to
be
spoken
of
open
-
mouthed
,
as
a
piece
of
ordinary
news
.
<EOS>
"
Which
way
shall
we
go
?
"
said
Kate
,
as
soon
as
they
had
passed
through
the
old
rickety
gate
,
which
swung
at
the
entrance
of
the
place
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Up
across
the
fell
,
"
said
George
;
"
the
day
is
fine
,
and
I
want
to
get
away
from
my
uncle
for
a
time
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
turned
round
,
therefore
,
outside
the
hill
of
firs
,
and
led
the
way
back
to
the
beacon
wood
through
which
she
and
Alice
had
walked
across
to
Haweswater
upon
a
memorable
occasion
.
<EOS>
They
had
reached
the
top
of
the
beacon
hill
,
and
were
out
upon
the
Fell
,
before
George
had
begun
his
story
.
<EOS>
Kate
was
half
beside
herself
with
curiosity
,
but
still
she
was
afraid
to
ask
.
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
said
George
,
when
they
paused
a
moment
as
they
stepped
over
a
plank
that
crossed
the
boundary
ditch
of
the
wood
:
"
do
n't
you
want
to
know
what
that
dear
old
man
has
done
for
you
?
"
<EOS>
Then
he
looked
into
her
face
very
steadfastly
.
"
<EOS>
But
perhaps
you
know
already
,
"
he
added
.
<EOS>
He
had
come
out
determined
not
to
quarrel
with
his
sister
.
<EOS>
He
had
resolved
,
in
that
moment
of
thought
which
had
been
allowed
to
him
,
that
his
best
hope
for
the
present
required
that
he
should
keep
himself
on
good
terms
with
her
,
at
any
rate
till
he
had
settled
what
line
of
conduct
he
would
pursue
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
,
in
truth
,
so
sore
with
anger
and
disappointment
,
 
he
had
become
so
nearly
mad
with
that
continued
,
unappeased
wrath
in
which
he
now
indulged
against
all
the
world
,
that
he
could
not
refrain
himself
from
bitter
words
.
<EOS>
He
was
as
one
driven
by
the
Furies
,
and
was
no
longer
able
to
control
them
in
their
driving
of
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
nothing
of
it
,
"
said
Kate
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Had
I
known
I
should
have
told
you
.
<EOS>
Your
question
is
unjust
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
beginning
to
doubt
,
"
said
he
,
"
whether
a
man
can
be
safe
in
trusting
any
one
.
<EOS>
My
grandfather
has
done
his
best
to
rob
me
of
the
property
altogether
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
told
you
that
I
feared
he
would
do
so
.
"
  
"
And
he
has
made
you
his
heir
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
Me
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
told
me
distinctly
that
he
would
not
do
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
he
has
,
I
tell
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
,
George
,
I
shall
do
that
which
I
told
him
I
should
do
in
the
event
of
his
making
such
a
will
;
for
he
asked
me
the
question
.
<EOS>
I
told
him
I
should
restore
the
estate
to
you
,
and
upon
that
he
swore
that
he
would
not
leave
it
to
me
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
what
a
fool
you
were
,
"
said
he
,
stopping
her
in
the
pathway
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
an
ass
!
<EOS>
Why
did
you
tell
him
that
?
<EOS>
You
knew
that
he
would
not
,
on
that
account
,
do
justice
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
asked
me
,
George
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Psha
!
<EOS>
now
you
have
ruined
me
,
and
you
might
have
saved
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
will
save
you
still
,
if
he
has
left
the
estate
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
desire
to
take
it
from
you
.
<EOS>
As
God
in
heaven
sees
me
,
I
have
never
ceased
to
endeavour
to
protect
your
interests
here
at
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
I
will
sign
anything
necessary
to
make
over
my
right
in
the
property
to
you
.
"
<EOS>
Then
they
walked
on
over
the
Fell
for
some
minutes
without
speaking
.
<EOS>
They
were
still
on
the
same
path
,
 
that
path
which
Kate
and
Alice
had
taken
in
the
winter
,
 
and
<EOS>
now
poor
Kate
could
not
but
think
of
all
that
she
had
said
that
day
on
George
's
behalf
;
 
how
had
she
mingled
truth
and
falsehood
in
her
efforts
to
raise
her
brother
's
character
in
her
cousin
's
eyes
!
<EOS>
It
had
all
been
done
in
vain
.
<EOS>
At
this
very
moment
of
her
own
trouble
Kate
thought
of
John
Grey
,
and
repented
of
what
she
had
done
.
<EOS>
Her
hopes
in
that
direction
were
altogether
blasted
.
<EOS>
She
knew
that
her
brother
had
ill
-
treated
Alice
,
and
that
she
must
tell
him
so
if
Alice
's
name
were
mentioned
between
them
.
<EOS>
She
could
no
longer
worship
her
brother
,
and
hold
herself
at
his
command
in
all
things
.
<EOS>
But
,
as
regarded
the
property
to
which
he
was
naturally
the
heir
,
if
any
act
of
hers
could
give
it
to
him
,
that
act
would
be
done
.
<EOS>
"
If
the
will
is
as
you
say
,
George
,
I
will
make
over
my
right
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
can
make
over
nothing
,
"
he
answered
.
<EOS>
"
The
old
robber
has
been
too
cunning
for
that
;
he
has
left
it
all
in
the
hands
of
my
uncle
John
.
<EOS>
D
 
---
him
.
<EOS>
D
 
---
them
both
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
George
!
<EOS>
George
!
<EOS>
he
is
dead
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Dead
;
of
course
he
is
dead
.
<EOS>
What
of
that
?
<EOS>
I
wish
he
had
been
dead
ten
years
ago
,
 
or
twenty
.
<EOS>
Do
you
suppose
I
am
to
forgive
him
because
he
is
dead
?
<EOS>
I
'll
heap
his
grave
with
curses
,
if
that
can
be
of
avail
to
punish
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
can
only
punish
the
living
that
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
I
will
punish
them
;
 
but
not
by
cursing
them
.
<EOS>
My
uncle
John
shall
have
such
a
life
of
it
for
the
next
year
or
two
that
he
shall
bitterly
regret
the
hour
in
which
he
has
stepped
between
me
and
my
rights
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
believe
that
he
has
done
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Not
done
so
!
<EOS>
What
was
he
down
here
for
at
Christmas
?
<EOS>
Do
you
pretend
to
think
that
that
make
-
believe
will
was
concocted
without
his
knowledge
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
sure
that
he
knew
nothing
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
think
my
grandfather
's
mind
was
made
up
a
week
before
he
died
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
'll
have
to
swear
that
,
remember
,
in
a
court
.
<EOS>
I
'm
not
going
to
let
the
matter
rest
,
I
can
tell
you
.
<EOS>
You
'll
have
to
prove
that
.
<EOS>
How
long
is
it
since
he
asked
you
what
you
would
do
with
the
estate
if
he
left
it
to
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
Kate
thought
for
a
moment
before
she
answered
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
only
two
days
before
he
died
,
if
I
remember
rightly
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
must
remember
rightly
.
<EOS>
You
'll
have
to
swear
to
it
.
<EOS>
And
now
tell
me
this
honestly
;
do
you
believe
,
in
your
heart
,
that
he
was
in
a
condition
fit
for
making
a
will
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
advised
him
not
to
make
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
?
why
?
<EOS>
What
reason
did
you
give
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
told
him
that
I
thought
no
man
should
alter
family
arrangements
when
he
was
so
ill
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Exactly
.
<EOS>
You
told
him
that
.
<EOS>
And
what
did
he
say
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
He
was
very
angry
,
and
made
me
send
for
Mr.
Gogram
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
Kate
,
think
a
little
before
you
answer
me
again
.
<EOS>
If
ever
you
are
to
do
me
a
good
turn
,
you
must
do
it
now
.
<EOS>
And
remember
this
,
I
do
n't
at
all
want
to
take
anything
away
from
you
.
<EOS>
Whatever
you
think
is
fair
you
shall
have
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
was
a
fool
not
to
have
known
her
better
than
that
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
want
nothing
,
"
she
said
,
stopping
,
and
stamping
with
her
foot
upon
the
crushed
heather
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
George
,
you
do
n't
understand
what
it
is
to
be
honest
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
smiled
,
 
with
a
slight
provoking
smile
that
passed
very
rapidly
from
his
face
.
<EOS>
The
meaning
of
the
smile
was
to
be
read
,
had
Kate
been
calm
enough
to
read
it
.
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
say
that
I
do
.
<EOS>
"
That
was
the
meaning
of
the
smile
.
<EOS>
"
Well
,
never
mind
about
that
,
"
said
he
;
"
you
advised
my
grandfather
not
to
make
his
will
,
 
thinking
,
no
doubt
,
that
his
mind
was
not
clear
enough
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
paused
a
moment
again
before
she
answered
him
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
His
mind
was
clear
,
"
she
said
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
thought
that
he
should
not
trust
his
judgement
while
he
was
so
weak
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Look
here
,
Kate
;
I
do
believe
that
you
at
any
rate
have
no
mind
to
assist
in
this
robbery
.
<EOS>
That
it
is
a
robbery
you
ca
n't
have
any
doubt
.
<EOS>
I
said
he
had
left
the
estate
to
you
.
<EOS>
That
is
not
what
he
has
done
.
<EOS>
He
has
left
the
estate
to
my
uncle
John
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
tell
me
,
then
,
what
was
untrue
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
disappointed
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
I
am
;
uncle
John
wo
n't
give
it
you
.
<EOS>
George
,
I
do
n't
understand
you
;
I
do
n't
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Never
mind
about
that
,
but
listen
to
me
.
<EOS>
The
estate
is
left
in
the
hands
of
John
Vavasor
;
but
he
has
left
you
five
hundred
a
year
out
of
it
till
somebody
is
twenty
-
five
years
old
who
is
not
yet
born
,
and
probably
never
will
be
born
.
<EOS>
The
will
itself
shows
the
old
fool
to
have
been
mad
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
was
no
more
mad
than
you
are
,
George
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Listen
to
me
,
I
tell
you
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
mean
that
he
was
a
raging
maniac
.
<EOS>
Now
,
you
had
advised
him
not
to
make
any
new
will
because
you
thought
he
was
not
in
a
fit
condition
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
I
did
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
can
swear
to
that
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
I
may
not
be
called
on
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
I
hope
there
may
be
no
swearing
about
it
.
<EOS>
But
if
I
am
asked
the
question
I
must
swear
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Exactly
.
<EOS>
Now
listen
till
you
understand
what
it
is
<EOS>
I
mean
.
<EOS>
That
will
,
if
it
stands
,
gives
all
the
power
over
the
estate
to
John
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
It
renders
you
quite
powerless
as
regards
any
help
or
assistance
that
you
might
be
disposed
to
give
to
me
.
<EOS>
But
,
nevertheless
,
your
interest
under
the
will
is
greater
than
his
,
 
or
than
that
of
any
one
else
,
 
for
your
son
would
inherit
if
I
have
none
.
<EOS>
Do
you
understand
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
I
think
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
your
testimony
as
to
the
invalidity
of
the
will
would
be
conclusive
against
all
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
say
in
a
court
what
I
have
told
you
,
if
that
will
do
any
good
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
will
not
be
enough
.
<EOS>
Look
here
,
Kate
;
you
must
be
steadfast
here
;
everything
depends
on
you
.
<EOS>
How
often
have
you
told
me
that
you
will
stick
to
me
throughout
life
?
<EOS>
Now
you
will
be
tried
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Kate
felt
that
her
repugnance
towards
him
,
 
towards
all
that
he
was
doing
and
wished
her
to
do
,
 
was
growing
stronger
within
her
at
every
word
he
spoke
.
<EOS>
She
was
becoming
gradually
aware
that
he
desired
from
her
something
which
she
could
not
and
would
not
do
,
and
she
was
aware
also
that
in
refusing
him
she
would
have
to
encounter
him
in
all
his
wrath
.
<EOS>
She
set
her
teeth
firmly
together
,
and
clenched
her
little
fist
.
<EOS>
If
a
fight
was
necessary
,
she
would
fight
with
him
.
<EOS>
As
he
looked
at
her
closely
with
his
sinister
eyes
,
her
love
towards
him
was
almost
turned
to
hatred
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
that
was
what
you
meant
when
you
advised
him
not
to
make
the
will
because
you
thought
his
intellect
was
impaired
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
not
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Stop
,
Kate
,
stop
.
<EOS>
If
you
will
think
of
it
,
It
was
so
.
<EOS>
What
is
the
meaning
of
his
judgement
being
weak
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
say
his
judgement
was
weak
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
that
was
what
you
meant
when
you
advised
him
not
to
trust
it
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Look
here
,
George
;
I
think
I
know
now
what
you
mean
.
<EOS>
If
anybody
asks
me
if
his
mind
was
gone
,
or
his
intellect
deranged
,
I
can
not
say
that
there
was
anything
of
the
kind
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
not
?
"
  
"
Certainly
not
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
untrue
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
you
are
determined
to
throw
me
over
and
claim
the
property
for
yourself
.
"
<EOS>
Again
he
turned
towards
and
looked
at
her
as
though
he
were
resolved
to
frighten
her
.
"
<EOS>
And
I
am
to
count
you
also
among
my
enemies
?
<EOS>
You
had
better
take
care
,
Kate
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
They
were
now
upon
the
fell
side
,
more
than
three
miles
away
from
the
Hall
;
and
Kate
,
as
she
looked
round
,
saw
that
they
were
all
alone
.
<EOS>
Not
a
cottage
,
 
not
a
sign
of
humanity
was
within
sight
.
<EOS>
Kate
saw
that
it
was
so
,
and
was
aware
that
the
fact
pressed
itself
upon
her
as
being
of
importance
.
<EOS>
Then
she
thought
again
of
her
resolution
to
fight
with
him
,
if
any
fight
were
necessary
;
to
tell
him
,
in
so
many
words
,
that
she
would
separate
herself
from
him
and
defy
him
.
<EOS>
She
would
not
fear
him
,
let
his
words
and
face
be
ever
so
terrible
!
<EOS>
Surely
her
own
brother
would
do
her
no
bodily
harm
.
<EOS>
And
even
though
he
should
do
so
,
 
though
he
should
take
her
roughly
by
the
arm
as
he
had
done
to
Alice
,
 
though
he
should
do
worse
than
that
,
still
she
would
fight
him
.
<EOS>
Her
blood
was
the
same
as
his
,
and
he
should
know
that
her
courage
was
,
at
any
rate
,
as
high
.
  
<EOS>
And
,
indeed
,
when
she
looked
at
him
,
she
had
cause
to
fear
.
<EOS>
He
intended
that
she
should
fear
.
<EOS>
He
intended
that
she
should
dread
what
he
might
do
to
her
at
that
moment
.
<EOS>
As
to
what
he
would
do
he
had
no
resolve
made
.
<EOS>
Neither
had
he
resolved
on
anything
when
he
had
gone
to
Alice
and
had
shaken
her
rudely
as
she
sat
beside
him
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
guided
by
no
fixed
intent
when
he
had
attacked
John
Grey
,
or
when
he
insulted
the
attorney
;
but
a
Fury
was
driving
him
,
and
he
was
conscious
of
being
so
driven
.
<EOS>
He
almost
wished
to
be
driven
to
some
act
of
frenzy
.
<EOS>
Everything
in
the
world
had
gone
against
him
,
and
he
desired
to
expend
his
rage
on
some
one
.
  
<EOS>
"
Kate
,
"
said
he
,
stopping
her
,
"
we
will
have
this
out
here
,
if
you
please
.
<EOS>
So
much
,
at
any
rate
,
shall
be
settled
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
You
have
made
many
promises
to
me
,
and
I
have
believed
them
.
<EOS>
You
can
now
keep
them
all
,
by
simply
saying
what
you
know
to
be
the
truth
,
 
that
that
old
man
was
a
drivelling
idiot
when
he
made
this
will
.
<EOS>
Are
you
prepared
to
do
me
that
justice
?
<EOS>
Think
before
you
answer
me
,
for
,
by
G
 
---
,
if
I
can
not
have
justice
among
you
,
I
will
have
revenge
.
"
<EOS>
And
he
put
his
hand
upon
her
breast
up
near
to
her
throat
.
  
<EOS>
"
Take
your
hand
down
,
George
,
"
said
she
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
not
such
a
fool
that
you
can
frighten
me
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Answer
me
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
and
shook
her
,
having
some
part
of
her
raiment
within
his
clutch
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
George
,
that
I
should
live
to
be
so
ashamed
of
my
brother
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Answer
me
,
"
he
said
again
;
and
again
he
shook
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
answered
you
.
<EOS>
I
will
say
nothing
of
the
kind
that
you
want
me
to
say
.
<EOS>
My
grandfather
,
up
to
the
latest
moment
that
I
saw
him
,
knew
what
he
was
about
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
an
idiot
.
<EOS>
He
was
,
I
believe
,
only
carrying
out
a
purpose
fixed
long
before
.
<EOS>
You
will
not
make
me
change
what
I
say
by
looking
at
me
like
that
,
nor
get
it
by
shaking
me
.
<EOS>
You
do
n't
know
me
,
George
,
if
you
think
you
can
frighten
me
like
a
child
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
heard
her
to
the
last
word
,
still
keeping
his
hand
upon
her
,
and
holding
her
by
the
cloak
she
wore
;
but
the
violence
of
his
grasp
had
relaxed
itself
,
and
he
let
her
finish
her
words
,
as
though
his
object
had
simply
been
to
make
her
speak
out
to
him
<EOS>
what
she
had
to
say
.
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
"
said
he
,
when
she
had
done
,
"
That
's
to
be
it
;
is
it
?
<EOS>
That
's
your
idea
of
honesty
.
<EOS>
The
very
name
of
the
money
being
your
own
has
been
too
much
for
you
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
whether
you
and
my
uncle
had
contrived
it
all
between
you
beforehand
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
not
dare
to
ask
him
,
because
he
is
a
man
,
"
said
Kate
,
her
eyes
brimming
with
tears
,
not
through
fear
,
but
in
very
vexation
at
the
nature
of
the
charge
he
had
brought
against
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
not
?
<EOS>
You
will
see
what
I
dare
do
.
<EOS>
As
for
you
,
with
all
your
promises
 
.
<EOS>
Kate
,
you
know
that
I
keep
my
word
.
<EOS>
Say
that
you
will
do
as
I
desire
you
,
or
I
will
be
the
death
of
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
mean
that
you
will
murder
me
?
"
said
she
.
  
<EOS>
"
Murder
you
!
<EOS>
yes
;
why
not
?
<EOS>
Treated
as
I
have
been
among
you
,
do
you
suppose
that
I
shall
stick
at
anything
?
<EOS>
Why
should
I
not
murder
you
 
<EOS>
you
and
Alice
,
too
,
<EOS>
seeing
how
you
have
betrayed
me
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Poor
Alice
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
she
spoke
the
words
she
looked
straight
into
his
eyes
,
as
though
defying
him
,
as
far
as
she
herself
were
concerned
.
  
<EOS>
"
Poor
Alice
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
D
 
<EOS>
---
hypocrite
!
<EOS>
There
's
a
pair
of
you
;
cursed
,
whining
,
false
,
intriguing
hypocrites
.
<EOS>
There
;
go
down
and
tell
your
uncle
and
that
old
woman
there
that
I
threatened
to
murder
you
.
<EOS>
Tell
the
judge
<EOS>
so
,
when
you
're
brought
into
court
to
swear
me
out
of
my
property
.
<EOS>
You
false
liar
!
"
<EOS>
Then
he
pushed
her
from
him
with
great
violence
,
so
that
she
fell
heavily
upon
the
stony
ground
.
  
<EOS>
He
did
not
stop
to
help
her
up
,
or
even
to
look
at
her
as
she
lay
,
but
walked
away
across
the
heath
,
neither
taking
the
track
on
towards
Haweswater
,
nor
returning
by
the
path
which
had
brought
them
thither
.
<EOS>
He
went
away
northwards
across
the
wild
fell
;
and
Kate
,
having
risen
up
and
seated
herself
on
a
small
cairn
of
stones
which
stood
there
,
watched
him
as
he
descended
the
slope
of
the
hill
till
he
was
out
of
sight
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
run
,
but
he
seemed
to
move
rapidly
,
and
he
never
once
turned
round
to
look
at
her
.
<EOS>
He
went
away
,
down
the
hill
northwards
,
and
presently
the
curving
of
the
ground
hid
him
from
her
view
.
  
<EOS>
When
she
first
seated
herself
her
thoughts
had
been
altogether
of
him
.
<EOS>
She
had
feared
no
personal
injury
,
even
when
she
had
asked
him
whether
he
would
murder
her
.
<EOS>
Her
blood
had
been
hot
within
her
veins
,
and
her
heart
had
been
full
of
defiance
.
<EOS>
Even
yet
she
feared
nothing
,
but
continued
to
think
of
him
and
his
misery
,
and
his
disgrace
.
<EOS>
That
he
was
gone
for
ever
,
utterly
and
irretrievably
ruined
,
thrown
out
,
as
it
were
,
beyond
the
pale
of
men
,
was
now
certain
to
her
.
<EOS>
And
this
was
the
brother
in
whom
she
had
believed
;
for
whom
she
had
not
only
been
willing
to
sacrifice
herself
,
but
for
whose
purposes
she
had
striven
to
sacrifice
her
cousin
!
<EOS>
What
would
he
do
now
?
<EOS>
As
he
passed
from
out
of
her
sight
down
the
hill
,
it
seemed
to
her
as
though
he
were
rushing
straight
into
some
hell
from
which
there
could
be
no
escape
.
  
<EOS>
She
knew
that
her
arm
had
been
hurt
in
the
fall
,
but
for
a
while
she
would
not
move
it
or
feel
it
,
being
resolved
to
take
no
account
of
what
might
have
happened
to
herself
.
<EOS>
But
when
he
had
been
gone
some
ten
minutes
,
she
rose
to
her
feet
,
and
finding
that
the
movement
pained
her
greatly
,
and
that
her
right
arm
was
powerless
,
she
put
up
her
left
hand
and
became
aware
that
the
bone
of
her
arm
was
broken
below
the
elbow
.
<EOS>
Her
first
thought
was
given
to
the
telling
him
of
this
,
or
the
not
telling
,
when
she
should
meet
him
below
at
the
house
.
<EOS>
How
should
she
mention
the
accident
to
him
?
<EOS>
Should
she
lie
,
and
say
that
she
had
fallen
as
she
came
down
the
hill
alone
?
<EOS>
Of
course
he
would
not
believe
her
,
but
still
some
such
excuse
as
that
might
make
the
matter
easier
for
them
all
.
<EOS>
It
did
not
occur
to
her
that
she
might
not
see
him
again
at
all
that
day
;
and
that
,
as
far
as
he
was
concerned
,
there
might
be
need
for
no
lie
.
  
<EOS>
She
started
off
to
walk
down
home
,
holding
her
right
arm
steadily
against
her
body
with
her
left
hand
.
<EOS>
Of
course
she
must
give
some
account
of
herself
when
she
got
to
the
house
;
but
it
was
of
the
account
to
be
given
to
him
that
she
thought
.
<EOS>
As
to
the
others
she
cared
little
for
them
.
<EOS>
"
Here
I
am
;
my
arm
is
broken
;
and
you
had
better
send
for
a
doctor
.
<EOS>
"
That
would
be
sufficient
for
them
.
  
<EOS>
When
she
got
into
the
wood
the
path
was
very
dark
.
<EOS>
The
heavens
were
overcast
with
clouds
,
and
a
few
drops
began
to
fall
.
<EOS>
Then
the
rain
fell
faster
and
faster
,
and
before
she
had
gone
a
quarter
of
a
mile
down
the
beacon
hill
,
the
clouds
had
opened
themselves
,
and
the
shower
had
become
a
storm
of
water
.
<EOS>
Suffering
as
she
was
<EOS>
she
stood
up
for
a
few
moments
under
a
large
tree
,
taking
the
excuse
of
the
rain
for
some
minutes
of
delay
,
that
she
might
make
up
her
mind
as
to
what
she
would
say
.
<EOS>
Then
it
occurred
to
her
that
she
might
possibly
meet
him
again
before
she
reached
the
house
;
and
,
as
she
thought
of
it
,
she
began
for
the
first
time
to
fear
him
.
<EOS>
Would
he
come
out
upon
her
from
the
trees
and
really
kill
her
?
<EOS>
Had
he
made
his
way
round
,
when
he
got
out
of
her
sight
,
that
he
might
fall
upon
her
suddenly
and
do
as
he
had
threatened
?
<EOS>
As
the
idea
came
upon
her
,
she
made
a
little
attempt
to
run
,
but
she
found
that
running
was
impracticable
from
the
pain
the
movement
caused
her
.
<EOS>
Then
she
walked
on
through
the
hard
rain
,
steadily
holding
her
arm
against
her
side
,
but
still
looking
every
moment
through
the
trees
on
the
side
from
which
George
might
be
expected
to
reach
her
.
<EOS>
But
no
one
came
near
her
on
her
way
homewards
.
<EOS>
Had
she
been
calm
enough
to
think
of
the
nature
of
the
ground
,
she
might
have
known
that
he
could
not
have
returned
upon
her
so
quickly
.
<EOS>
He
must
have
come
back
up
the
steep
hill
-
side
which
she
had
seen
him
descend
.
<EOS>
No
;
 
he
had
gone
away
altogether
,
across
the
fells
towards
Bampton
,
and
was
at
this
moment
vainly
buttoning
his
coat
across
his
breast
,
in
his
unconscious
attempt
to
keep
out
the
wet
.
<EOS>
The
Fury
was
driving
him
on
,
and
he
himself
was
not
aware
whither
he
was
driven
.
  
<EOS>
Dinner
at
the
Hall
had
been
ordered
at
five
,
the
old
hour
;
or
rather
that
had
been
assumed
to
be
the
hour
for
dinner
without
any
ordering
.
<EOS>
It
was
just
five
when
Kate
reached
the
front
door
.
<EOS>
This
she
opened
with
her
left
hand
,
and
turning
at
once
into
the
dining
-
room
,
found
her
uncle
and
her
aunt
standing
before
the
fire
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dinner
is
ready
,
"
said
John
Vavasor
;
"
where
is
George
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
wet
,
Kate
,
"
said
aunt
Greenow
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
am
very
wet
,
"
said
Kate
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
go
up
-
stairs
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
you
'll
come
with
me
,
aunt
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Come
with
you
,
 
of
course
I
will
.
"
<EOS>
Aunt
Greenow
had
seen
at
once
that
something
was
amiss
.
  
<EOS>
"
Where
's
George
?
"
said
John
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Has
he
come
back
with
you
,
or
are
we
to
wait
for
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
Kate
seated
herself
in
her
chair
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
quite
know
where
he
is
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
her
aunt
had
hastened
up
to
her
side
just
in
time
to
catch
her
as
she
was
falling
from
her
chair
.
<EOS>
"
My
arm
,
"
said
Kate
,
very
gently
;
"
my
arm
!
"
<EOS>
Then
she
slipped
down
against
her
aunt
,
and
had
fainted
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
has
done
her
a
mischief
,
"
said
Mrs.
Greenow
,
looking
up
at
her
brother
.
<EOS>
"
This
is
his
doing
.
"
  
<EOS>
John
Vavasor
stood
confounded
,
wishing
himself
back
in
Queen
Anne
Street
.
   
<EOS>
Showing
How
the
Wild
Beast
Got
Himself
Back
from
the
Mountains
.
 
<EOS>
About
eleven
o'clock
on
that
night
,
 
the
night
of
the
day
on
which
Kate
Vavasor
's
arm
had
been
broken
,
 
there
came
a
gentle
knock
at
Kate
's
bedroom
door
.
<EOS>
There
was
nothing
surprising
in
this
,
as
of
all
the
household
Kate
only
was
in
bed
.
<EOS>
Her
aunt
was
sitting
at
this
time
by
her
bedside
,
and
the
doctor
,
who
had
been
summoned
from
Penrith
and
who
had
set
her
broken
arm
,
was
still
in
the
house
,
talking
over
the
accident
with
John
Vavasor
in
the
dining
-
room
,
before
he
proceeded
back
on
his
journey
home
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
will
do
very
well
,
"
said
the
doctor
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
only
a
simple
fracture
.
<EOS>
I
'll
see
her
the
day
after
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
it
not
odd
that
such
an
accident
should
come
from
a
fall
whilst
walking
?
"
asked
Mr.
Vavasor
.
  
<EOS>
The
doctor
shrugged
his
shoulders
.
<EOS>
"
One
never
can
say
how
anything
may
occur
,
"
said
he
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
a
young
woman
who
broke
the
os
femoris
by
just
kicking
her
cat
;
 
at
least
,
she
said
she
did
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Indeed
!
<EOS>
I
suppose
you
did
n't
take
any
trouble
to
inquire
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Not
much
.
<EOS>
My
business
was
with
the
injury
,
not
with
the
way
she
got
it
.
<EOS>
Somebody
did
make
inquiry
,
but
she
stuck
to
her
story
and
nothing
came
of
it
.
<EOS>
Good
night
,
Mr.
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
trouble
her
with
questions
till
she
has
had
some
hours
"
sleep
,
at
any
rate
.
<EOS>
"
Then
the
doctor
went
,
and
John
Vavasor
was
left
alone
,
standing
with
his
back
to
the
dining
-
room
fire
.
  
<EOS>
There
had
been
so
much
trouble
and
confusion
in
the
house
since
Kate
had
fainted
,
almost
immediately
upon
her
reaching
home
,
that
Mr.
Vavasor
had
not
yet
had
time
to
make
up
his
mind
as
to
the
nature
of
the
accident
which
had
occurred
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Greenow
had
at
once
ascertained
that
the
bone
was
broken
,
and
the
doctor
had
been
sent
for
.
<EOS>
Luckily
he
had
been
found
at
home
,
and
had
reached
the
Hall
a
little
before
ten
o'clock
.
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
,
as
soon
as
Kate
recovered
her
senses
,
she
volunteered
her
account
of
what
had
occurred
.
  
<EOS>
Her
brother
had
quarrelled
with
her
about
the
will
,
she
said
,
and
had
left
her
abruptly
on
the
mountain
.
<EOS>
She
had
fallen
,
she
went
on
to
say
,
as
she
turned
from
him
,
and
had
at
once
found
that
she
had
hurt
herself
.
<EOS>
But
she
had
been
too
angry
with
him
to
let
him
know
it
;
and
,
indeed
,
she
had
not
known
the
extent
herself
till
he
had
passed
out
of
her
sight
.
<EOS>
This
was
her
story
;
and
there
was
nothing
in
it
that
was
false
by
the
letter
,
though
there
was
much
that
was
false
in
the
spirit
.
<EOS>
It
was
certainly
true
that
George
had
not
known
that
she
was
injured
.
<EOS>
It
was
true
that
she
had
asked
him
for
no
help
.
<EOS>
It
was
true
,
in
one
sense
,
that
she
had
fallen
,
and
it
was
true
that
she
had
not
herself
known
how
severe
had
been
the
injury
done
to
her
till
he
had
gone
beyond
the
reach
of
her
voice
.
<EOS>
But
she
repressed
all
mention
of
his
violence
,
and
when
she
was
pressed
as
to
the
nature
of
the
quarrel
,
she
declined
to
speak
further
on
that
matter
.
  
<EOS>
Neither
her
uncle
nor
her
aunt
believed
her
.
<EOS>
That
was
a
matter
of
course
,
and
she
knew
that
they
did
not
believe
her
.
<EOS>
George
's
absence
,
their
recent
experience
of
his
moods
,
and
the
violence
by
which
her
arm
must
have
been
broken
,
made
them
certain
that
Kate
had
more
to
tell
if
she
chose
to
tell
it
.
<EOS>
But
in
her
present
condition
they
could
not
question
her
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Greenow
did
ask
as
to
the
probability
of
her
nephew
's
return
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
only
tell
you
,
"
said
Kate
,
"
that
he
went
away
across
the
Fell
in
the
direction
of
Bampton
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
he
has
gone
on
to
Penrith
.
<EOS>
He
was
very
angry
with
us
all
;
and
as
the
house
is
not
his
own
,
he
has
probably
resolved
that
he
will
not
stay
another
night
under
the
roof
.
<EOS>
But
,
who
can
say
?
<EOS>
He
is
not
in
his
senses
when
he
is
angered
.
"
  
<EOS>
John
Vavasor
,
as
he
stood
alone
after
the
doctor
's
departure
,
endeavoured
to
ascertain
the
truth
by
thinking
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
,
"
he
said
to
himself
,
"
that
the
doctor
suspects
that
there
has
been
violence
.
<EOS>
I
know
it
from
his
tone
,
and
I
can
see
it
in
his
eye
.
<EOS>
But
how
to
prove
it
?
<EOS>
and
would
there
be
good
in
proving
it
?
<EOS>
Poor
girl
!
<EOS>
Will
it
not
be
better
for
her
to
let
it
pass
as
though
we
believed
her
story
?
"
<EOS>
He
made
up
his
mind
that
it
would
be
better
.
<EOS>
Why
should
he
take
upon
himself
the
terrible
task
of
calling
this
insane
relation
to
account
for
an
act
which
he
could
not
prove
?
<EOS>
The
will
itself
,
without
that
trouble
,
would
give
him
trouble
enough
.
<EOS>
Then
he
began
to
long
that
he
was
back
at
his
club
,
and
to
think
that
the
signing
-
room
in
Chancery
Lane
was
not
so
bad
.
<EOS>
And
so
he
went
up
to
his
bed
,
calling
at
Kate
's
door
to
ask
after
the
patient
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
there
had
come
a
messenger
to
Mrs.
Greenow
,
who
had
stationed
herself
with
her
niece
.
<EOS>
One
of
the
girls
of
the
house
brought
up
a
scrap
of
paper
to
the
door
,
saying
that
a
boy
had
brought
it
over
with
a
cart
from
Shap
,
and
that
it
was
intended
for
Miss
Vavasor
,
and
it
was
she
who
knocked
at
the
sickroom
door
.
<EOS>
The
note
was
open
and
was
not
addressed
;
indeed
,
the
words
were
written
on
a
scrap
of
paper
that
was
crumpled
up
rather
than
folded
,
and
were
as
follows
:
<EOS>
"
Send
me
my
clothes
by
the
bearer
.
<EOS>
I
shall
not
return
to
the
house
.
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Greenow
took
it
in
to
Kate
,
and
then
went
away
to
see
her
nephew
's
things
duly
put
into
his
portmanteau
.
<EOS>
This
was
sent
away
in
the
cart
,
and
Mr.
Vavasor
,
as
he
went
up
-
stairs
,
was
told
what
had
been
done
.
  
<EOS>
Neither
on
that
night
or
on
the
following
day
did
Mrs.
Greenow
ask
any
further
questions
;
but
on
the
morning
after
that
,
when
the
doctor
had
left
them
with
a
good
account
of
the
broken
limb
,
her
curiosity
would
brook
no
further
delay
.
<EOS>
And
,
indeed
,
indignation
as
well
as
curiosity
urged
her
on
.
<EOS>
In
disposition
she
was
less
easy
,
and
,
perhaps
,
less
selfish
,
than
her
brother
.
<EOS>
If
it
were
the
case
that
that
man
had
ill
-
treated
his
sister
,
she
would
have
sacrificed
much
to
bring
him
to
punishment
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Kate
,
"
she
said
,
when
the
doctor
was
gone
,
"
I
expect
that
you
will
tell
me
the
whole
truth
as
to
what
occurred
between
you
and
your
brother
when
you
had
this
accident
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
told
you
the
truth
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
not
the
whole
truth
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
All
the
truth
I
mean
to
tell
,
aunt
.
<EOS>
He
has
quarrelled
with
me
,
as
I
think
,
most
unnecessarily
,
but
you
do
n't
suppose
that
I
am
going
to
give
an
exact
account
of
the
quarrel
?
<EOS>
We
were
both
wrong
,
probably
,
and
so
let
there
be
an
end
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Was
he
violent
to
you
when
he
quarrelled
with
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
When
he
is
angry
he
is
always
violent
in
his
language
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
did
he
strike
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
aunt
,
do
n't
be
angry
with
me
if
I
say
that
I
wo
n't
be
cross
-
examined
.
<EOS>
I
would
rather
answer
no
more
questions
about
it
.
<EOS>
I
know
that
questioning
can
do
no
good
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Greenow
knew
her
niece
well
enough
to
be
aware
that
nothing
more
would
be
told
her
,
but
she
was
quite
sure
now
that
Kate
had
not
broken
her
arm
by
a
simple
fall
.
<EOS>
She
was
certain
that
the
injury
had
come
from
positive
violence
.
<EOS>
Had
it
not
been
so
,
Kate
would
not
have
contented
herself
with
refusing
to
answer
the
last
question
that
had
been
asked
,
but
would
also
have
repelled
the
charge
made
against
her
brother
with
indignation
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
have
it
your
own
way
,
"
said
Mrs.
Greenow
;
"
but
let
me
just
tell
you
this
,
that
your
brother
George
had
better
keep
out
of
my
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
probable
that
he
will
,
"
said
Kate
.
<EOS>
"
Especially
if
you
remain
here
to
nurse
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Kate
's
conduct
in
answering
all
the
questions
made
to
her
was
not
difficult
,
but
she
found
that
there
was
much
difficulty
in
planning
her
own
future
behaviour
towards
her
own
brother
.
<EOS>
Must
she
abandon
him
altogether
from
henceforth
;
divide
herself
from
him
,
as
it
were
;
have
perfectly
separate
interests
,
and
interests
that
were
indeed
hostile
?
<EOS>
and
must
she
see
him
ruined
and
overwhelmed
by
want
of
money
,
while
she
had
been
made
a
rich
woman
by
her
grandfather
's
will
?
<EOS>
It
will
be
remembered
that
her
life
had
hitherto
been
devoted
to
him
;
that
all
her
schemes
and
plans
had
had
his
success
as
their
object
;
that
she
had
taught
herself
to
consider
it
to
be
her
duty
to
sacrifice
everything
to
his
welfare
.
<EOS>
It
is
very
sad
to
abandon
the
only
object
of
a
life
!
<EOS>
It
is
very
hard
to
tear
out
from
one
's
heart
and
fling
away
from
it
the
only
love
that
one
has
cherished
!
<EOS>
What
was
she
to
say
to
Alice
about
all
this
 
to
Alice
whom
she
had
cheated
of
a
husband
worthy
of
her
,
that
she
might
allure
her
into
the
arms
of
one
so
utterly
unworthy
?
<EOS>
Luckily
for
Kate
,
her
accident
was
of
such
a
nature
that
any
writing
to
Alice
was
now
out
of
the
question
.
  
<EOS>
But
a
blow
!
<EOS>
What
woman
can
bear
a
blow
from
a
man
,
and
afterwards
return
to
him
with
love
?
<EOS>
A
wife
may
have
to
bear
it
and
to
return
.
<EOS>
And
she
may
return
with
that
sort
of
love
which
is
a
thing
of
custom
.
<EOS>
The
man
is
the
father
of
her
children
,
and
earns
the
bread
which
they
eat
and
which
she
eats
.
<EOS>
Habit
and
the
ways
of
the
world
require
that
she
should
be
careful
in
his
interests
,
and
that
she
should
live
with
him
in
what
amity
is
possible
to
them
.
<EOS>
But
as
for
love
,
 
all
that
we
mean
by
love
when
we
speak
of
it
and
write
of
it
,
 
a
blow
given
by
the
defender
to
the
defenceless
crushes
it
all
!
<EOS>
A
woman
may
forgive
deceit
,
treachery
,
desertion
,
 
even
the
preference
given
to
a
rival
.
<EOS>
She
may
forgive
them
and
forget
them
;
but
I
do
not
think
that
a
woman
can
forget
a
blow
.
<EOS>
And
as
for
forgiveness
,
 
it
is
not
the
blow
that
she
can
not
forgive
,
but
the
meanness
of
spirit
that
made
it
possible
.
  
<EOS>
Kate
,
as
she
thought
of
it
,
told
herself
that
everything
in
life
was
over
for
her
.
<EOS>
She
had
long
feared
her
brother
's
nature
,
 
had
feared
that
he
was
hard
and
heartless
;
but
still
there
had
been
some
hope
with
her
fear
.
<EOS>
Success
,
if
he
could
be
made
to
achieve
it
,
would
soften
him
,
and
then
all
might
be
right
.
<EOS>
But
now
all
was
wrong
,
and
she
knew
that
it
was
so
.
<EOS>
When
he
had
compelled
her
to
write
to
Alice
for
money
,
her
faith
in
him
had
almost
succumbed
.
<EOS>
That
had
been
very
mean
,
and
the
meanness
had
shocked
her
.
<EOS>
But
now
he
had
asked
her
to
perjure
herself
that
he
might
have
his
own
way
,
and
had
threatened
to
murder
her
,
and
had
raised
his
hand
against
her
because
she
had
refused
to
obey
him
.
<EOS>
And
he
had
accused
her
of
treachery
to
himself
,
 
had
accused
her
of
premeditated
deceit
in
obtaining
this
property
for
herself
!
  
<EOS>
"
But
he
does
not
believe
it
,
"
said
Kate
to
herself
.
"
<EOS>
He
said
that
because
he
thought
it
would
vex
me
;
but
I
know
he
does
not
think
it
.
"
<EOS>
Kate
had
watched
her
brother
longing
for
money
all
his
life
,
 
had
thoroughly
understood
the
intensity
of
his
wish
for
it
,
 
the
agony
of
his
desire
.
<EOS>
But
so
far
removed
was
she
from
any
such
longing
on
her
own
account
,
that
she
could
not
believe
that
her
brother
would
in
his
heart
accuse
her
of
it
.
<EOS>
How
often
had
she
offered
to
give
him
,
on
the
instant
,
<EOS>
every
shilling
that
she
had
in
the
world
!
<EOS>
At
this
moment
she
resolved
,
in
her
mind
,
that
she
never
wished
to
see
him
more
;
but
even
now
,
had
it
been
practicable
,
she
would
have
made
over
to
him
,
without
any
drawback
,
all
her
interest
in
the
Vavasor
estate
.
  
<EOS>
But
any
such
making
over
was
impossible
.
<EOS>
John
Vavasor
remained
in
Westmoreland
for
a
week
,
and
during
that
time
many
discussions
were
,
of
course
,
held
about
the
property
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Round
came
down
from
London
,
and
met
Mr.
Gogram
at
Penrith
.
<EOS>
As
to
the
validity
of
the
will
Mr.
Round
said
that
there
was
no
shadow
of
a
doubt
.
<EOS>
So
an
agent
was
appointed
for
receiving
the
rents
,
and
it
was
agreed
that
the
old
Hall
should
be
let
in
six
months
from
that
date
.
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
Kate
was
to
remain
there
till
her
arm
should
become
strong
,
and
she
could
make
her
plans
for
the
future
.
<EOS>
Aunt
Greenow
promised
to
remain
at
the
Hall
for
the
present
,
and
offered
,
indeed
,
indefinite
services
for
the
future
,
as
though
she
were
quite
forgetful
of
Captain
Bellfield
.
<EOS>
Of
Mr.
Cheesacre
she
was
not
forgetful
,
for
she
still
continued
to
speak
of
that
gentleman
to
Kate
,
as
though
he
were
Kate
's
suitor
.
<EOS>
But
she
did
not
now
press
upon
her
niece
the
acceptance
of
Mr.
Cheesacre
's
hand
as
an
absolute
duty
.
<EOS>
Kate
was
mistress
of
a
considerable
fortune
,
and
though
such
a
marriage
might
be
comfortable
,
it
was
no
longer
necessary
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Greenow
called
him
poor
Cheesacre
,
pointing
out
how
easily
he
might
be
managed
,
and
how
indubitable
were
his
possessions
;
but
she
no
longer
spoke
of
Kate
's
chances
in
the
marriage
market
as
desperate
,
even
though
she
should
decline
the
Cheesacre
alliance
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
young
woman
,
with
six
hundred
a
year
,
my
dear
,
may
do
pretty
nearly
what
she
pleases
,
"
said
aunt
Greenow
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
better
than
having
ten
years
"
grace
given
you
.
"
  
"
And
will
last
longer
,
certainly
,
"
said
Kate
.
  
<EOS>
Kate
's
desire
was
that
Alice
should
come
down
to
her
for
a
while
in
Westmoreland
,
before
the
six
months
were
over
,
and
this
desire
she
mentioned
to
her
uncle
.
<EOS>
He
promised
to
carry
the
message
up
to
Alice
,
but
could
not
be
got
to
say
more
than
that
upon
the
subject
.
<EOS>
Then
Mr.
Vavasor
went
away
,
leaving
the
aunt
and
niece
together
at
the
Hall
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
on
earth
shall
we
do
if
that
wild
beast
shows
himself
suddenly
among
us
women
?
"
asked
Mrs.
Greenow
of
her
brother
.
  
<EOS>
The
brother
could
only
say
,
"
that
he
hoped
the
wild
beast
would
keep
his
distance
.
"
  
<EOS>
And
the
wild
beast
did
keep
his
distance
,
at
any
rate
as
long
as
Mrs.
Greenow
remained
at
the
Hall
.
<EOS>
We
will
now
go
back
to
the
wild
beast
,
and
tell
how
he
walked
across
the
mountains
,
in
the
rain
,
to
Bampton
,
a
little
village
at
the
foot
of
Haweswater
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
remembered
that
after
he
had
struck
his
sister
,
he
turned
away
from
her
,
and
walked
with
quick
steps
down
the
mountain
-
side
,
never
turning
back
to
look
at
her
.
<EOS>
He
had
found
himself
to
be
without
any
power
of
persuasion
over
her
,
as
regarded
her
evidence
to
be
given
,
if
the
will
were
questioned
.
<EOS>
The
more
he
threatened
her
the
steadier
she
had
been
in
asserting
her
belief
in
her
grandfather
's
capacity
.
<EOS>
She
had
looked
into
his
eye
and
defied
him
,
and
he
had
felt
himself
to
be
worsted
.
<EOS>
What
was
he
to
do
?
<EOS>
In
truth
,
there
was
nothing
for
him
to
do
.
<EOS>
He
had
told
her
that
he
would
murder
her
;
and
in
the
state
of
mind
to
which
his
fury
had
driven
him
,
murder
had
suggested
itself
to
him
as
a
resource
to
which
he
might
apply
himself
.
<EOS>
But
what
could
he
gain
by
murdering
her
,
 
or
,
at
any
rate
,
by
murdering
her
then
,
out
on
the
mountain
-
side
?
<EOS>
Nothing
but
a
hanging
!
<EOS>
There
would
be
no
gratification
even
to
his
revenge
.
<EOS>
If
,
indeed
,
he
had
murdered
that
old
man
,
who
was
now
,
unfortunately
,
gone
beyond
the
reach
of
murder
;
 
if
he
could
have
poisoned
the
old
man
's
cup
before
that
last
will
had
been
made
 
there
might
have
been
something
in
such
a
deed
!
<EOS>
But
he
had
merely
thought
of
it
,
letting
"
I
dare
not
wait
upon
I
would
"
 
as
he
now
told
himself
,
with
much
self
-
reproach
.
<EOS>
Nothing
was
to
be
got
by
killing
his
sister
.
<EOS>
So
he
restrained
himself
in
his
passion
,
and
walked
away
from
her
,
solitary
,
down
the
mountain
.
  
<EOS>
The
rain
soon
came
on
,
and
found
him
exposed
on
the
hill
-
side
.
<EOS>
He
thought
little
about
it
,
but
buttoned
his
coat
,
as
I
have
said
before
,
and
strode
on
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
storm
of
rain
,
so
that
he
was
forced
to
hold
his
head
to
one
side
,
as
it
hit
him
from
the
north
.
<EOS>
But
with
his
hand
to
his
hat
,
and
his
head
bent
against
the
wind
,
he
went
on
till
he
had
reached
the
valley
at
the
foot
,
and
found
that
the
track
by
which
he
had
been
led
thither
had
become
a
road
.
<EOS>
He
had
never
known
the
mountains
round
the
Hall
as
Kate
had
known
them
,
and
was
not
aware
whither
he
was
going
.
<EOS>
On
one
thing
only
had
he
made
up
his
mind
since
he
had
left
his
sister
,
and
that
was
that
he
would
not
return
to
the
house
.
<EOS>
He
knew
that
he
could
do
nothing
there
to
serve
his
purpose
;
his
threats
would
be
vain
impotence
;
he
had
no
longer
any
friend
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
He
could
hardly
tell
himself
what
line
of
conduct
he
would
pursue
,
but
he
thought
that
he
would
hurry
back
to
London
,
and
grasp
at
whatever
money
he
could
get
from
Alice
.
<EOS>
He
was
still
,
at
this
moment
,
a
Member
of
Parliament
;
and
as
the
rain
drenched
him
through
and
through
,
he
endeavoured
to
get
consolation
from
the
remembrance
of
that
fact
in
his
favour
.
  
<EOS>
As
he
got
near
the
village
he
overtook
a
shepherd
boy
coming
down
from
the
hills
,
and
learned
his
whereabouts
from
him
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Baampton
,
"
said
the
boy
,
with
an
accent
that
was
almost
Scotch
,
when
he
was
asked
the
name
of
the
place
.
<EOS>
When
Vavasor
further
asked
whether
a
gig
were
kept
there
,
the
boy
simply
stared
at
him
,
not
knowing
a
gig
by
that
name
.
<EOS>
At
last
,
however
,
he
was
made
to
understand
the
nature
of
his
companion
's
want
,
and
expressed
his
belief
that
"
John
Applethwaite
,
up
at
the
Craigs
yon
,
had
got
a
mickle
cart
.
"
<EOS>
But
the
Craigs
was
a
farm
-
house
,
which
now
came
in
view
about
a
mile
off
,
up
across
the
valley
;
and
Vavasor
,
hoping
that
he
might
still
find
a
speedier
conveyance
than
John
Applethwaite
's
mickle
cart
,
went
on
to
the
public
-
house
in
the
village
.
<EOS>
But
,
in
truth
,
neither
there
,
nor
yet
from
John
Applethwaite
,
to
whom
at
last
an
application
was
sent
,
could
he
get
any
vehicle
;
and
between
six
and
seven
he
started
off
again
,
through
the
rain
,
to
make
his
weary
way
on
foot
to
Shap
.
<EOS>
The
distance
was
about
five
miles
,
and
the
little
byways
,
lying
between
walls
,
were
sticky
,
and
almost
glutinous
with
light
-
coloured
,
chalky
mud
.
<EOS>
Before
he
started
he
took
a
glass
of
hot
rum
-
and
-
water
,
but
the
effect
of
that
soon
passed
away
from
him
,
and
then
he
became
colder
and
weaker
than
he
had
been
before
.
  
<EOS>
Wearily
and
wretchedly
he
plodded
on
.
<EOS>
A
man
may
be
very
weary
in
such
a
walk
as
that
,
and
yet
be
by
no
means
wretched
.
<EOS>
Tired
,
hungry
,
cold
,
wet
,
and
nearly
penniless
,
I
have
sat
me
down
and
slept
among
those
mountain
tracks
,
 
have
slept
because
nature
refused
to
allow
longer
wakefulness
.
<EOS>
But
my
heart
has
been
as
light
as
my
purse
,
and
there
has
been
something
in
the
air
of
the
hills
that
made
me
buoyant
and
happy
in
the
midst
of
my
weariness
.
<EOS>
But
George
Vavasor
was
wretched
as
well
as
weary
,
and
every
step
that
he
took
,
plodding
through
the
mud
,
was
a
new
misfortune
to
him
.
<EOS>
What
are
five
miles
of
a
walk
to
a
young
man
,
even
though
the
rain
be
falling
and
the
ways
be
dirty
?
<EOS>
what
,
though
they
may
come
after
some
other
ten
that
he
has
already
traversed
on
his
feet
?
<EOS>
His
sister
Kate
would
have
thought
nothing
of
the
distance
.
<EOS>
But
George
stopped
on
his
way
from
time
to
time
,
leaning
on
the
loose
walls
,
and
cursing
the
misfortune
that
had
brought
him
to
such
a
pass
.
<EOS>
He
cursed
his
grandfather
,
his
uncle
,
his
sister
,
his
cousin
,
and
himself
.
<EOS>
He
cursed
the
place
in
which
his
forefathers
had
lived
,
and
he
cursed
the
whole
county
.
<EOS>
He
cursed
the
rain
,
and
the
wind
,
and
his
town
-
made
boots
,
which
would
not
keep
out
the
wet
slush
.
<EOS>
He
cursed
the
light
as
it
faded
,
and
the
darkness
as
it
came
.
<EOS>
Over
and
over
again
he
cursed
the
will
that
had
robbed
him
,
and
the
attorney
that
had
made
it
.
<EOS>
He
cursed
the
mother
that
had
borne
him
and
the
father
that
had
left
him
poor
.
<EOS>
He
thought
of
Scruby
,
and
cursed
him
,
thinking
how
that
money
would
be
again
required
of
him
by
that
stern
agent
.
<EOS>
He
cursed
the
House
of
Commons
,
which
had
cost
him
so
much
,
and
the
greedy
electors
who
would
not
send
him
there
without
his
paying
for
it
.
<EOS>
He
cursed
John
Grey
,
as
he
thought
of
those
two
thousand
pounds
,
with
double
curses
.
<EOS>
He
cursed
this
world
,
and
all
worlds
beyond
;
and
thus
,
cursing
everything
,
he
made
his
way
at
last
up
to
the
inn
at
Shap
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
nearly
nine
when
he
got
there
.
<EOS>
He
had
wasted
over
an
hour
at
Bampton
in
his
endeavour
to
get
John
Applethwaite
's
cart
to
carry
him
on
,
and
he
had
been
two
hours
on
his
walk
from
Bampton
to
Shap
,
 
two
hours
amidst
his
cursing
.
<EOS>
He
ordered
supper
and
brandy
-
and
-
water
,
and
,
as
we
know
,
sent
off
a
Mercury
for
his
clothes
.
<EOS>
But
the
Mercuries
of
Westmoreland
do
not
move
on
quick
wings
,
and
it
was
past
midnight
before
he
got
his
possessions
.
<EOS>
During
all
this
time
he
had
,
by
no
means
,
ceased
from
cursing
,
but
continued
it
over
his
broiled
ham
and
while
he
swallowed
his
brandy
-
and
-
water
.
<EOS>
He
swore
aloud
,
so
that
the
red
-
armed
servant
at
the
inn
could
not
but
hear
him
,
that
those
thieves
at
the
Hall
intended
to
rob
him
of
his
clothes
;
 
that
they
would
not
send
him
his
property
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
restrain
himself
,
though
he
knew
that
every
word
he
uttered
would
injure
his
cause
,
as
regarded
the
property
in
Westmoreland
,
if
ever
he
could
make
a
cause
.
<EOS>
He
knew
that
he
had
been
mad
to
strike
his
sister
,
and
cursed
himself
for
his
madness
.
<EOS>
Yet
he
could
not
restrain
himself
.
<EOS>
He
told
himself
that
the
battle
for
him
was
over
,
and
he
thought
of
poison
for
himself
.
<EOS>
He
thought
of
poison
,
and
a
pistol
,
 
of
the
pistols
he
had
ever
loaded
at
home
,
each
with
six
shots
,
good
for
a
life
apiece
.
<EOS>
He
thought
of
an
express
train
,
rushing
along
at
its
full
career
,
and
of
the
instant
annihilation
which
it
would
produce
.
<EOS>
But
if
that
was
to
be
the
end
of
him
,
he
would
not
go
alone
.
<EOS>
No
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
why
should
he
go
alone
,
leaving
those
pistols
ready
loaded
in
his
desk
?
<EOS>
Among
them
they
had
brought
him
to
ruin
and
to
death
.
<EOS>
Was
he
a
man
to
pardon
his
enemies
when
it
was
within
his
power
to
take
them
with
him
,
down
,
down
,
down
 
?
<EOS>
What
were
the
last
words
upon
his
impious
lips
,
as
with
bloodshot
eyes
,
half
drunk
,
and
driven
by
the
Fury
,
he
took
himself
off
to
the
bed
prepared
for
him
,
cursing
aloud
the
poor
red
-
haired
girl
as
he
went
,
I
may
not
utter
here
.
   
<EOS>
The
Pallisers
at
Breakfast
.
 
<EOS>
Gentle
reader
,
do
you
remember
Lady
Monk
's
party
,
and
how
it
ended
,
 
how
it
ended
,
at
least
as
regards
those
special
guests
with
whom
we
are
concerned
?
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
went
away
early
,
Mrs.
Marsham
followed
him
to
his
house
in
Park
Lane
,
caught
him
at
home
,
and
told
her
tale
.
<EOS>
He
returned
to
his
wife
,
found
her
sitting
with
Burgo
in
the
dining
-
room
,
under
the
Argus
eyes
of
the
constant
Bott
,
and
bore
her
away
home
.
<EOS>
Burgo
disappeared
utterly
from
the
scene
,
and
Mr.
Bott
,
complaining
inwardly
that
virtue
was
too
frequently
allowed
to
be
its
own
reward
,
comforted
himself
with
champagne
,
and
then
walked
off
to
his
lodgings
.
<EOS>
Lady
Monk
,
when
Mr.
Palliser
made
his
way
into
her
room
up
-
stairs
,
seeking
his
wife
's
scarf
,
 
which
little
incident
,
also
,
the
reader
may
perhaps
remember
,
 
saw
that
the
game
was
up
,
and
thought
with
regret
of
the
loss
of
her
two
hundred
pounds
.
<EOS>
Such
was
the
ending
of
Lady
Monk
's
party
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
,
on
her
journey
home
in
the
carriage
with
her
husband
,
had
openly
suggested
that
Mrs.
Marsham
had
gone
to
Park
Lane
to
tell
of
her
doings
with
Burgo
,
and
had
declared
her
resolution
never
again
to
see
either
that
lady
or
Mr.
Bott
in
her
own
house
.
<EOS>
This
<EOS>
she
said
with
more
of
defiance
in
her
tone
than
Mr.
Palliser
had
ever
hitherto
heard
.
<EOS>
He
was
by
nature
less
ready
than
her
,
and
knowing
his
own
deficiency
in
that
respect
,
abstained
from
all
answer
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
during
that
drive
home
very
few
further
words
were
spoken
between
them
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
breakfast
with
you
to
-
morrow
,
"
he
said
to
her
,
as
she
prepared
to
go
up
-
stairs
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
work
still
to
do
to
-
night
,
and
I
will
not
disturb
you
by
coming
to
your
room
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
wo
n't
want
me
to
be
very
early
?
"
said
his
wife
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
he
,
with
more
of
anger
in
his
voice
than
he
had
yet
shown
.
<EOS>
"
What
hour
will
suit
you
?
<EOS>
I
must
say
something
of
what
has
occurred
to
-
night
before
I
leave
you
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
what
you
can
have
got
to
say
about
to
-
night
,
but
I
'll
be
down
by
half
-
past
eleven
,
if
that
will
do
?
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
said
that
he
would
make
it
do
,
and
then
they
parted
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
had
played
her
part
very
well
before
her
husband
.
<EOS>
She
had
declined
to
be
frightened
by
him
;
had
been
the
first
to
mention
Burgo
's
name
,
and
had
done
so
with
no
tremor
in
her
voice
,
and
had
boldly
declared
her
irreconcilable
enmity
to
the
male
and
female
duennas
who
had
dared
to
take
her
in
charge
.
<EOS>
While
she
was
in
the
carriage
with
her
husband
she
felt
some
triumph
in
her
own
strength
;
and
as
she
wished
him
good
night
on
the
staircase
,
and
slowly
walked
up
to
her
room
,
without
having
once
lowered
her
eyes
before
his
,
something
of
this
consciousness
of
triumph
still
supported
her
.
<EOS>
And
even
while
her
maid
remained
with
her
she
held
herself
up
,
as
it
were
,
inwardly
,
telling
herself
that
she
would
not
yield
,
 
that
she
would
not
be
cowed
either
by
her
husband
or
by
his
spies
.
<EOS>
But
when
she
was
left
alone
all
her
triumph
departed
from
her
.
  
<EOS>
She
bade
her
maid
go
while
she
was
still
sitting
in
her
dressing
-
gown
;
and
when
the
girl
was
gone
<EOS>
she
got
close
over
the
fire
,
sitting
with
her
slippers
on
the
fender
,
with
her
elbows
on
her
knees
,
and
her
face
resting
on
her
hands
.
<EOS>
In
this
position
she
remained
for
an
hour
,
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
altering
shapes
of
the
hot
coals
.
<EOS>
During
this
hour
her
spirit
was
by
no
means
defiant
,
and
her
thoughts
of
herself
anything
but
triumphant
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bott
and
Mrs.
Marsham
she
had
forgotten
altogether
.
<EOS>
After
all
,
they
were
but
buzzing
flies
,
who
annoyed
her
by
their
presence
.
<EOS>
Should
she
choose
to
leave
her
husband
,
they
could
not
prevent
her
leaving
him
.
<EOS>
It
was
of
her
husband
and
of
Burgo
that
she
was
thinking
,
 
weighing
them
one
against
the
other
,
and
connecting
her
own
existence
with
theirs
,
not
as
expecting
joy
or
the
comfort
of
love
from
either
of
them
,
but
with
an
assured
conviction
that
on
either
side
there
must
be
misery
for
her
.
<EOS>
But
of
that
shame
before
all
the
world
which
must
be
hers
for
ever
,
should
she
break
her
vows
and
consent
to
live
with
a
man
who
was
not
her
husband
,
she
thought
hardly
at
all
.
<EOS>
That
which
in
the
estimation
of
Alice
was
everything
,
to
her
,
at
this
moment
,
was
almost
nothing
.
<EOS>
For
herself
,
she
had
been
sacrificed
;
and
,
 
as
she
told
herself
with
bitter
denunciations
against
herself
,
 
had
been
sacrificed
through
her
own
weakness
.
<EOS>
But
that
was
done
.
<EOS>
Whatever
way
she
might
go
,
she
was
lost
.
<EOS>
They
had
married
her
to
a
man
who
cared
nothing
for
a
wife
,
nothing
for
any
woman
,
 
so
at
least
she
declared
to
herself
,
 
but
who
had
wanted
a
wife
that
he
might
have
an
heir
.
<EOS>
Had
it
been
given
to
her
to
have
a
child
<EOS>
,
she
thought
that
she
might
have
been
happy
,
 
sufficiently
happy
in
sharing
her
husband
's
joy
in
that
respect
.
<EOS>
But
everything
had
gone
against
her
.
<EOS>
There
was
nothing
in
her
home
to
give
her
comfort
.
"
<EOS>
He
looks
at
me
every
time
he
sees
me
as
the
cause
of
his
misfortune
,
"
she
said
to
herself
.
<EOS>
Of
her
husband
's
rank
,
of
the
future
possession
of
his
title
and
his
estates
,
she
thought
much
.
<EOS>
But
of
her
own
wealth
she
thought
nothing
.
<EOS>
It
did
not
occur
to
her
that
she
had
given
him
enough
in
that
respect
to
make
his
marriage
with
her
a
comfort
to
him
.
<EOS>
She
took
it
for
granted
that
that
marriage
was
now
one
distasteful
to
him
,
as
it
was
to
herself
,
and
that
he
would
eventually
be
the
gainer
if
she
should
so
conduct
herself
that
her
marriage
might
be
dissolved
.
  
<EOS>
As
to
Burgo
,
I
doubt
whether
she
deceived
herself
much
as
to
his
character
.
<EOS>
She
knew
well
enough
that
he
was
a
man
infinitely
less
worthy
than
her
husband
.
<EOS>
She
knew
that
he
was
a
spendthrift
,
idle
,
given
to
bad
courses
,
 
that
he
drank
,
that
he
gambled
,
that
he
lived
the
life
of
the
loosest
man
about
the
town
.
<EOS>
She
knew
also
that
whatever
chance
she
might
have
had
to
redeem
him
,
had
she
married
him
honestly
before
all
the
world
,
there
could
be
no
such
chance
if
she
went
to
him
as
his
mistress
,
abandoning
her
husband
and
all
her
duties
,
and
making
herself
vile
in
the
eyes
of
all
women
.
<EOS>
Burgo
Fitzgerald
would
not
be
influenced
for
good
by
such
a
woman
as
she
would
then
be
.
<EOS>
She
knew
much
of
the
world
and
its
ways
,
and
told
herself
no
lies
about
this
.
<EOS>
But
,
as
I
have
said
before
,
she
did
not
count
herself
for
much
.
<EOS>
What
though
she
were
ruined
?
<EOS>
What
though
Burgo
were
false
,
mean
,
and
untrustworthy
?
<EOS>
She
loved
him
,
and
he
was
the
only
man
she
ever
had
loved
!
<EOS>
Lower
and
lower
<EOS>
she
crouched
before
the
fire
;
and
then
,
when
the
coals
were
no
longer
red
,
and
the
shapes
altered
themselves
no
more
,
she
crept
into
bed
.
<EOS>
As
to
what
she
should
say
to
her
husband
on
the
following
morning
,
 
she
had
not
yet
begun
to
think
of
that
.
  
<EOS>
Exactly
at
half
-
past
eleven
she
entered
the
little
breakfast
parlour
which
looked
out
over
the
park
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
prettiest
room
in
the
house
,
and
now
,
at
this
springtide
,
when
the
town
trees
were
putting
out
their
earliest
greens
,
and
were
fresh
and
bright
almost
as
country
trees
,
it
might
be
hard
to
find
a
prettier
chamber
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
was
there
already
,
sitting
with
the
morning
paper
in
his
hand
.
<EOS>
He
rose
when
she
entered
,
and
,
coming
up
to
her
,
just
touched
her
with
his
lips
.
<EOS>
She
put
her
cheek
up
to
him
,
and
then
took
her
place
at
the
breakfast
table
.
  
<EOS>
"
Have
you
any
headache
this
morning
?
"
he
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
no
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
Then
he
took
his
tea
and
his
toast
,
spoke
some
word
to
her
about
the
fineness
of
the
weather
,
told
her
some
scraps
of
news
,
and
soon
returned
to
the
absorbing
interest
of
a
speech
made
by
the
leader
of
the
Opposition
in
the
House
of
Lords
.
<EOS>
The
speech
was
very
interesting
to
Mr.
Palliser
,
because
in
it
the
noble
lord
alluded
to
a
break
-
up
in
the
present
Cabinet
,
as
to
which
the
rumours
were
,
he
said
,
so
rife
through
the
country
as
to
have
destroyed
all
that
feeling
of
security
in
the
existing
Government
which
the
country
so
much
valued
and
desired
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
had
as
yet
heard
no
official
tidings
of
such
a
rupture
;
but
if
such
rupture
were
to
take
place
,
it
must
be
in
his
favour
.
<EOS>
He
felt
himself
at
this
moment
to
be
full
of
politics
,
 
to
be
near
the
object
of
his
ambition
,
to
have
affairs
upon
his
hands
which
required
all
his
attention
.
<EOS>
Was
it
absolutely
incumbent
on
him
to
refer
again
to
the
incidents
of
last
night
?
<EOS>
The
doing
so
would
be
odious
to
him
.
<EOS>
The
remembrance
of
the
task
now
immediately
before
him
destroyed
all
his
political
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
believe
that
his
wife
was
in
any
serious
danger
.
<EOS>
Might
it
not
yet
be
possible
for
him
to
escape
from
the
annoyance
,
and
to
wash
his
mind
clean
of
all
suspicion
?
<EOS>
He
was
not
jealous
;
he
was
indeed
incapable
of
jealousy
.
<EOS>
He
knew
what
it
would
be
to
be
dishonoured
,
and
he
knew
that
under
certain
circumstances
the
world
would
expect
him
to
exert
himself
in
a
certain
way
.
<EOS>
But
the
thing
that
he
had
now
to
do
was
a
great
trouble
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
would
rather
have
to
address
the
House
of
Commons
with
ten
columns
of
figures
than
utter
a
word
of
remonstrance
to
his
wife
.
<EOS>
But
she
had
defied
him
,
 
defied
him
by
saying
that
she
would
see
his
friends
no
more
;
and
it
was
the
remembrance
of
this
,
as
he
sat
behind
his
newspaper
,
that
made
him
ultimately
feel
that
he
could
not
pass
in
silence
over
what
had
been
done
.
  
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
he
went
on
reading
,
or
pretending
to
read
,
as
long
as
the
continuance
of
the
breakfast
made
it
certain
that
his
wife
would
remain
with
him
.
<EOS>
Every
now
<EOS>
and
then
he
said
some
word
to
her
of
what
he
was
reading
,
endeavouring
to
use
the
tone
of
voice
that
was
customary
to
him
in
his
domestic
teachings
of
politics
.
<EOS>
But
through
it
all
there
was
a
certain
hesitation
,
 
there
were
the
sure
signs
of
an
attempt
being
made
,
of
which
he
was
himself
conscious
,
and
which
she
understood
with
the
most
perfect
accuracy
.
<EOS>
He
was
deferring
the
evil
moment
,
and
vainly
endeavouring
to
make
himself
believe
that
he
was
comfortably
employed
the
while
.
<EOS>
She
had
no
newspaper
,
and
made
no
endeavour
to
deceive
herself
.
<EOS>
She
,
therefore
,
was
the
first
to
begin
the
conversation
.
  
<EOS>
"
Plantagenet
,
"
she
said
,
"
you
told
me
last
night
,
as
I
was
going
to
bed
,
that
you
had
something
to
say
about
Lady
Monk
's
party
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
put
down
the
newspaper
slowly
,
and
turned
towards
her
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
After
what
happened
,
I
believe
that
I
must
say
something
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
think
anything
,
pray
say
it
,
"
said
Glencora
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
always
easy
for
a
man
to
show
what
he
thinks
by
what
he
says
,
"
he
replied
.
<EOS>
"
My
fear
is
that
you
should
suppose
me
to
think
more
than
I
do
.
<EOS>
And
it
was
for
that
reason
that
I
determined
to
sleep
on
it
before
I
spoke
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
anybody
is
angry
with
me
<EOS>
I
'd
much
<EOS>
rather
they
should
have
it
out
with
me
while
their
anger
is
hot
.
<EOS>
I
hate
cold
anger
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
am
not
angry
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
what
husbands
always
say
when
they
're
going
to
scold
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
am
not
going
to
scold
.
<EOS>
I
am
only
going
to
advise
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'd
sooner
be
scolded
.
<EOS>
Advice
is
to
anger
just
what
cold
anger
is
to
hot
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
my
dear
Glencora
,
surely
if
I
find
it
necessary
to
speak
 
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
want
to
stop
you
,
Plantagenet
.
<EOS>
Pray
,
go
on
.
<EOS>
Only
it
will
be
so
nice
to
have
it
over
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
was
now
more
than
ever
averse
to
the
task
before
him
.
<EOS>
Husbands
,
when
they
give
their
wives
a
talking
,
should
do
it
out
of
hand
,
uttering
their
words
hard
,
sharp
,
and
quick
,
 
and
should
then
go
.
<EOS>
There
are
some
works
that
wo
n't
bear
a
preface
,
and
this
work
of
marital
fault
-
finding
is
one
of
them
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
was
already
beginning
to
find
out
the
truth
of
this
.
<EOS>
"
Glencora
,
"
he
said
,
"
I
wish
you
to
be
serious
with
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
serious
,
"
she
replied
,
as
she
settled
herself
in
her
chair
with
an
air
of
mockery
,
while
her
eyes
and
mouth
were
bright
and
eloquent
with
a
spirit
which
her
husband
did
not
love
to
see
.
<EOS>
Poor
girl
!
<EOS>
There
was
seriousness
enough
in
store
for
her
before
she
would
be
able
to
leave
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
ought
to
be
serious
.
<EOS>
Do
you
know
why
Mrs.
Marsham
came
here
from
Lady
Monk
's
last
night
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
I
do
.
<EOS>
She
came
to
tell
you
that
I
was
waltzing
with
Burgo
Fitzgerald
.
<EOS>
You
might
as
well
ask
me
whether
I
knew
why
Mr.
Bott
was
standing
at
all
the
doors
,
glaring
at
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
anything
about
Mr.
Bott
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
something
about
him
though
,
"
she
said
,
again
moving
herself
in
her
chair
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
speaking
now
of
Mrs.
Marsham
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
should
speak
of
them
both
together
as
they
hunt
in
couples
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Glencora
,
will
you
listen
to
me
,
or
will
you
not
?
<EOS>
If
you
say
that
you
will
not
,
I
shall
know
what
to
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
you
would
,
Plantagenet
.
"
<EOS>
And
she
nodded
her
little
head
at
him
,
as
she
spoke
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
sure
I
do
n't
know
what
you
would
do
.
<EOS>
But
I
will
listen
to
you
.
<EOS>
Only
,
as
I
said
before
,
it
will
be
very
nice
when
it
's
over
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Marsham
came
here
,
not
simply
to
tell
me
that
you
were
waltzing
with
Mr.
Fitzgerald
,
 
and
I
wish
that
when
you
mention
his
name
you
would
call
him
Mr.
Fitzgerald
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
So
I
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
generally
prefix
his
Christian
name
,
which
it
would
be
much
better
that
you
should
omit
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
try
,
"
she
said
,
very
gently
;
"
but
it
's
hard
to
drop
an
old
habit
.
<EOS>
Before
you
married
me
you
knew
that
I
had
learned
to
call
him
Burgo
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Let
me
go
on
,
"
said
Mr.
Palliser
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
certainly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
not
simply
to
tell
me
that
you
were
waltzing
that
Mrs.
Marsham
came
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
it
was
not
simply
to
see
me
waltzing
that
Mr.
Bott
stood
in
the
doorways
,
for
he
followed
me
about
,
and
came
down
after
me
to
the
supper
-
room
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Glencora
,
will
you
oblige
me
by
not
speaking
of
Mr.
Bott
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
you
would
oblige
me
by
not
speaking
of
Mrs.
Marsham
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
rose
quickly
from
his
chair
with
a
gesture
of
anger
,
stood
upright
for
half
a
minute
,
and
then
sat
down
again
.
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
Plantagenet
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
know
what
you
want
,
and
I
'll
hold
my
tongue
till
you
bid
me
speak
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Marsham
came
here
because
she
saw
that
every
one
in
the
room
was
regarding
you
with
wonder
.
"
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
twisted
herself
about
in
her
chair
,
but
she
said
nothing
.
"
<EOS>
She
saw
that
you
were
not
only
dancing
with
Mr.
Fitzgerald
,
but
that
you
were
dancing
with
him
,
 
what
shall
I
say
?
"
  
"
Upon
my
word
I
ca
n't
tell
you
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
Recklessly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
recklessly
,
was
I
?
<EOS>
What
was
I
reckless
of
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Reckless
of
what
people
might
say
;
reckless
of
what
I
might
feel
about
it
;
reckless
of
your
own
position
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Am
I
to
speak
now
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
you
had
better
let
me
go
on
.
<EOS>
I
think
she
was
right
to
come
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
of
course
.
<EOS>
What
's
the
good
of
having
spies
,
if
they
do
n't
run
and
tell
as
soon
as
they
see
anything
,
especially
anything
 
reckless
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Glencora
,
you
are
determined
to
make
me
angry
.
<EOS>
I
am
angry
now
,
 
very
angry
.
<EOS>
I
have
employed
no
spies
.
<EOS>
When
rumours
have
reached
me
,
not
from
spies
,
as
you
choose
to
call
them
,
but
through
your
dearest
friends
and
mine
 
"
  
"
What
do
you
mean
by
rumours
from
my
dearest
friends
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Never
mind
.
<EOS>
Let
me
go
on
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
not
when
you
say
my
dear
friends
have
spread
rumours
about
me
.
<EOS>
Tell
me
who
they
are
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
dear
friends
.
<EOS>
Do
you
mean
Alice
Vavasor
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
does
not
signify
.
<EOS>
But
when
I
was
warned
that
you
had
better
not
go
to
any
house
in
which
you
could
meet
that
man
,
I
would
not
listen
to
it
.
<EOS>
I
said
that
you
were
my
wife
,
and
that
as
such
I
could
trust
you
anywhere
,
everywhere
,
with
any
person
.
<EOS>
Others
might
distrust
you
,
but
I
would
not
do
so
.
<EOS>
When
I
wished
you
to
go
to
Monkshade
,
were
there
to
be
any
spies
there
?
<EOS>
When
I
left
you
last
night
at
Lady
Monk
's
,
do
you
believe
in
your
heart
that
I
trusted
to
Mrs.
Marsham
's
eyes
rather
than
to
your
own
truth
?
<EOS>
Do
you
think
that
I
have
lived
in
fear
of
Mr.
Fitzgerald
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
No
,
Plantagenet
;
I
do
not
think
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
you
believe
that
I
have
commissioned
Mr.
Bott
to
watch
your
conduct
?
<EOS>
Answer
me
,
Glencora
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
paused
a
moment
,
thinking
what
actually
was
her
true
belief
on
that
subject
.
<EOS>
"
He
does
watch
me
,
certainly
,
"
she
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
does
not
answer
my
question
.
<EOS>
Do
you
believe
that
I
have
commissioned
him
to
do
so
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
I
do
not
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
it
is
ignoble
in
you
to
talk
to
me
of
spies
.
<EOS>
I
have
employed
no
spies
.
<EOS>
If
it
were
ever
to
come
to
that
,
that
I
thought
spies
necessary
,
it
would
be
all
over
with
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
something
of
feeling
in
his
voice
as
he
said
this
,
 
something
that
almost
approached
to
passion
which
touched
his
wife
's
heart
.
<EOS>
Whether
or
not
spies
would
be
of
any
avail
,
she
knew
that
she
had
in
truth
done
that
of
which
he
had
declared
that
he
had
never
suspected
her
.
<EOS>
She
had
listened
to
words
of
love
from
her
former
lover
.
<EOS>
She
had
received
,
and
now
carried
about
with
her
a
letter
from
this
man
,
in
which
he
asked
her
to
elope
with
him
.
<EOS>
She
had
by
no
means
resolved
that
she
would
not
do
this
thing
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
false
to
her
husband
;
and
as
her
husband
spoke
of
his
confidence
in
her
,
her
own
spirit
rebelled
against
the
deceit
which
she
herself
was
practising
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
that
I
have
never
made
you
happy
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
that
I
never
can
make
you
happy
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
looked
at
her
,
struck
by
her
altered
tone
,
and
saw
that
her
whole
manner
and
demeanour
were
changed
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
understand
what
you
mean
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
never
complained
.
<EOS>
You
have
not
made
me
unhappy
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
was
one
of
those
men
to
whom
this
was
enough
.
<EOS>
If
his
wife
caused
him
no
uneasiness
,
what
more
was
he
to
expect
from
her
?
<EOS>
No
doubt
she
might
have
done
much
more
for
him
.
<EOS>
She
might
have
given
him
an
heir
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
a
just
man
,
and
knew
that
the
blank
he
had
drawn
was
his
misfortune
,
and
not
her
fault
.
  
<EOS>
But
now
her
heart
was
loosed
and
she
spoke
out
,
at
first
slowly
,
but
after
a
while
with
all
the
quietness
of
strong
passion
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
Plantagenet
;
I
shall
never
make
you
happy
.
<EOS>
You
have
never
loved
me
,
nor
I
you
.
<EOS>
We
have
never
loved
each
other
for
a
single
moment
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
wrong
to
talk
to
you
about
spies
;
I
was
wrong
to
go
to
Lady
Monk
's
;
I
have
been
wrong
in
everything
that
I
have
done
;
but
never
so
wrong
as
when
I
let
them
persuade
me
to
be
your
wife
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Glencora
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Let
me
speak
now
,
Plantagenet
,
It
is
better
that
I
should
tell
you
everything
;
and
I
will
.
<EOS>
I
will
tell
you
everything
;
 
everything
!
<EOS>
I
do
love
Burgo
Fitzgerald
.
<EOS>
I
do
!
<EOS>
I
do
!
<EOS>
I
do
!
<EOS>
How
can
I
help
loving
him
?
<EOS>
Have
I
not
loved
him
from
the
first
,
 
before
I
had
seen
you
?
<EOS>
Did
you
not
know
that
it
was
so
?
<EOS>
I
do
love
Burgo
Fitzgerald
,
and
when
I
went
to
Lady
Monk
's
last
night
,
I
had
almost
made
up
my
mind
that
I
must
tell
him
so
,
and
that
I
must
go
away
with
him
and
hide
myself
.
<EOS>
But
when
he
came
to
speak
to
me
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
He
has
asked
you
to
go
with
him
,
then
?
"
said
the
husband
,
in
whose
bosom
the
poison
was
beginning
to
take
effect
,
thereby
showing
that
he
was
neither
above
nor
below
humanity
.
  
<EOS>
Glencora
was
immediately
reminded
that
though
she
might
,
if
she
pleased
,
tell
her
own
secrets
,
she
ought
not
,
in
accordance
with
her
ideas
of
honour
,
tell
those
of
her
lover
.
<EOS>
"
What
need
is
there
of
asking
,
do
you
think
,
when
people
have
loved
each
other
as
we
have
done
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
wanted
to
go
with
him
,
then
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Would
it
not
have
been
the
best
for
you
?
<EOS>
Plantagenet
,
I
do
not
love
you
;
 
not
as
women
love
their
husbands
when
they
do
love
them
.
<EOS>
But
,
before
God
,
my
first
wish
is
to
free
you
from
the
misfortune
that
I
have
brought
on
you
.
"
<EOS>
As
she
made
this
attestation
she
started
up
from
her
chair
,
and
coming
close
to
him
,
took
him
by
the
coat
.
<EOS>
He
was
startled
,
and
stepped
back
a
pace
,
but
did
not
speak
;
and
then
stood
looking
at
her
as
she
went
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
matters
it
whether
I
drown
myself
,
or
throw
myself
away
by
going
with
such
a
one
as
him
,
so
that
you
might
marry
again
,
and
have
a
child
?
<EOS>
I
'd
die
;
 
I
'd
die
willingly
.
<EOS>
How
I
wish
I
could
die
!
<EOS>
Plantagenet
,
I
would
kill
myself
if
I
dared
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
was
a
tall
man
and
she
was
short
of
stature
,
so
that
he
stood
over
her
and
looked
upon
her
,
and
now
she
was
looking
up
into
his
face
with
all
her
eyes
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
 
<EOS>
I
would
!
<EOS>
What
is
there
left
for
me
that
I
should
wish
to
live
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Softly
,
slowly
,
very
gradually
,
as
though
he
were
afraid
of
what
he
was
doing
,
he
put
his
arm
round
her
waist
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
wrong
in
one
thing
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
love
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
shook
her
head
,
touching
his
breast
with
her
hair
as
she
did
so
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
love
you
,
"
he
repeated
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
mean
that
I
am
not
apt
at
telling
you
<EOS>
so
,
it
is
true
,
I
know
.
<EOS>
My
mind
is
running
on
other
things
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
she
said
;
"
your
mind
is
running
on
other
things
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
do
love
you
.
<EOS>
If
you
can
not
love
me
,
it
is
a
great
misfortune
to
us
both
.
<EOS>
But
we
need
not
therefore
be
disgraced
.
<EOS>
As
for
that
other
thing
of
which
you
spoke
,
 
of
our
having
,
as
yet
,
no
child
"
 
and
in
saying
this
he
pressed
her
somewhat
closer
with
his
arm
 
<EOS>
"
you
allow
yourself
to
think
too
much
of
it
;
 
much
more
of
it
than
I
do
.
<EOS>
I
have
made
no
complaints
on
that
head
,
even
within
my
own
breast
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
what
your
thoughts
are
,
Plantagenet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Believe
me
that
you
wrong
my
thoughts
.
<EOS>
Of
course
I
have
been
anxious
,
and
have
,
perhaps
,
shown
my
anxiety
by
the
struggle
I
have
made
to
hide
it
.
<EOS>
I
have
never
told
you
what
is
false
,
Glencora
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
you
are
not
false
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
rather
have
you
for
my
wife
,
childless
,
 
if
you
will
try
to
love
me
,
 
than
any
other
woman
,
though
another
might
give
me
an
heir
.
<EOS>
Will
you
try
to
love
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
was
silent
.
<EOS>
At
this
moment
,
after
the
confession
that
she
had
made
,
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
say
that
she
would
even
try
.
<EOS>
Had
she
said
so
<EOS>
,
she
would
have
seemed
to
have
accepted
his
forgiveness
too
easily
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
dear
,
"
he
said
,
still
holding
her
by
her
waist
,
"
that
we
had
better
leave
England
for
a
while
.
<EOS>
I
will
give
up
politics
for
this
season
.
<EOS>
Should
you
like
to
go
to
Switzerland
for
the
summer
,
or
perhaps
to
some
of
the
German
baths
,
and
then
on
to
Italy
when
the
weather
is
cold
enough
?
"
<EOS>
Still
she
was
silent
.
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
your
friend
,
Miss
Vavasor
,
would
go
with
us
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
was
killing
her
by
his
goodness
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
speak
to
him
yet
;
but
now
,
as
he
mentioned
Alice
's
name
,
she
gently
put
up
her
hand
and
rested
it
on
the
back
of
his
.
  
<EOS>
At
that
moment
there
came
a
knock
at
the
door
;
 
a
sharp
knock
,
which
was
quickly
repeated
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
in
,
"
said
Mr.
Palliser
,
dropping
his
arm
from
his
wife
's
waist
,
and
standing
away
from
her
a
few
yards
.
   
<EOS>
The
Duke
of
St.
Bungay
in
Search
of
a
Minister
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
the
butler
who
had
knocked
,
 
showing
that
the
knock
was
of
more
importance
than
it
would
have
been
had
it
been
struck
by
the
knuckles
of
the
footman
in
livery
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
please
,
sir
,
the
Duke
of
St.
Bungay
is
here
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
Duke
of
St.
Bungay
!
"
said
Mr.
Palliser
,
becoming
rather
red
as
he
heard
the
announcement
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
,
his
grace
is
in
the
library
.
<EOS>
He
bade
me
tell
you
that
he
particularly
wanted
to
see
you
;
so
I
told
him
that
you
were
with
my
lady
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Quite
right
;
tell
his
grace
that
I
will
be
with
him
in
two
minutes
.
"
<EOS>
Then
the
butler
retired
,
and
Mr.
Palliser
was
again
alone
with
his
wife
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
go
now
,
my
dear
,
"
he
said
;
"
and
perhaps
I
shall
not
see
you
again
till
the
evening
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
n't
let
me
put
you
out
in
any
way
,
"
she
answered
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
no
;
 
<EOS>
you
wo
n't
put
me
out
.
<EOS>
You
will
be
dressing
,
I
suppose
,
about
nine
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
not
mean
as
to
that
,
"
she
answered
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
not
think
more
of
Italy
.
<EOS>
He
has
come
to
tell
you
that
you
are
wanted
in
the
Cabinet
.
"
  
<EOS>
Again
he
turned
very
red
.
<EOS>
"
It
may
be
so
,
"
he
answered
,
"
but
though
I
am
wanted
,
I
need
not
go
.
<EOS>
But
I
must
not
keep
the
duke
waiting
.
<EOS>
Good
-
bye
.
"
<EOS>
And
he
turned
to
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
She
followed
him
and
took
hold
of
him
as
he
went
,
so
that
he
was
forced
to
turn
to
her
once
again
.
<EOS>
She
managed
to
get
hold
of
both
his
hands
,
and
pressed
them
closely
,
looking
up
into
his
face
with
her
eyes
laden
with
tears
.
<EOS>
He
smiled
at
her
gently
,
returned
the
pressure
of
the
hands
,
and
then
left
her
,
 
without
kissing
her
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
that
he
was
minded
not
to
kiss
her
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
kissed
her
willingly
enough
<EOS>
had
he
thought
that
the
occasion
required
it
.
"
<EOS>
He
says
that
he
loves
me
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
to
herself
,
"
but
he
does
not
know
what
love
means
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
But
she
was
quite
aware
that
he
had
behaved
to
her
with
genuine
,
true
nobility
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
she
was
alone
and
certain
of
her
solitude
,
she
took
out
that
letter
from
her
pocket
,
and
tearing
it
into
very
small
fragments
,
without
reading
it
,
threw
the
pieces
on
the
fire
.
<EOS>
As
she
did
so
,
her
mind
seemed
to
be
fixed
,
at
any
rate
,
to
one
thing
,
 
that
she
would
think
no
more
of
Burgo
Fitzgerald
as
her
future
master
.
<EOS>
I
think
,
however
,
that
she
had
arrived
at
so
much
certainty
as
this
,
at
that
moment
in
which
she
had
been
parting
with
Burgo
Fitzgerald
,
in
Lady
Monk
's
dining
-
room
.
<EOS>
She
had
had
courage
enough
,
 
or
shall
we
rather
say
sin
enough
,
 
to
think
of
going
with
him
,
 
to
tell
herself
that
she
would
do
so
;
to
put
herself
in
the
way
of
doing
it
;
nay
,
she
had
had
enough
of
both
to
enable
her
to
tell
her
husband
that
she
had
resolved
that
it
would
be
good
for
her
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
But
she
was
neither
bold
enough
nor
wicked
enough
to
do
the
thing
.
<EOS>
As
she
had
said
of
her
own
idea
of
destroying
herself
,
 
she
did
not
dare
to
take
the
plunge
.
<EOS>
Therefore
,
knowing
now
that
it
was
so
,
she
tore
up
the
letter
that
she
had
carried
so
long
,
and
burnt
it
in
the
fire
.
  
<EOS>
She
had
in
truth
told
him
everything
,
believing
that
in
doing
so
she
was
delivering
her
own
death
-
warrant
as
regarded
her
future
position
in
his
house
.
<EOS>
She
had
done
this
,
not
hoping
thereby
for
any
escape
;
not
with
any
purpose
as
regarded
herself
,
but
simply
because
deceit
had
been
grievous
to
her
,
and
had
become
unendurable
as
soon
as
his
words
and
manner
had
in
them
any
feeling
of
kindness
.
<EOS>
But
her
confession
had
no
sooner
been
made
than
her
fault
had
been
forgiven
.
<EOS>
She
had
told
him
that
she
did
not
love
him
.
<EOS>
She
had
told
him
,
even
,
that
she
had
thought
of
leaving
him
.
<EOS>
She
had
justified
by
her
own
words
any
treatment
of
his
,
however
harsh
,
which
he
might
choose
to
practise
.
<EOS>
But
the
result
had
been
 
the
immediate
result
 
that
he
had
been
more
tender
to
her
than
she
had
ever
remembered
him
to
be
before
.
<EOS>
She
knew
that
he
had
conquered
her
.
<EOS>
However
cold
and
heartless
his
home
might
be
to
her
,
it
must
be
her
home
now
.
<EOS>
There
could
be
no
further
thought
of
leaving
him
.
<EOS>
She
had
gone
out
into
the
tiltyard
and
had
tilted
with
him
,
and
he
had
been
the
victor
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
himself
had
not
time
for
much
thought
before
he
found
himself
closeted
with
the
Duke
;
but
as
he
crossed
the
hall
and
went
up
the
stairs
,
a
thought
or
two
did
pass
quickly
across
his
mind
.
<EOS>
She
had
confessed
to
him
,
and
he
had
forgiven
her
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
feel
quite
sure
that
he
had
been
right
,
but
he
did
feel
quite
sure
that
the
thing
had
been
done
.
<EOS>
He
recognized
it
for
a
fact
that
,
as
regarded
the
past
,
no
more
was
to
be
said
.
<EOS>
There
were
to
be
no
reproaches
,
and
there
must
be
some
tacit
abandoning
of
Mrs.
Marsham
's
close
attendance
.
<EOS>
As
to
Mr.
Bott
;
 
he
had
begun
to
hate
Mr.
Bott
,
and
had
felt
cruelly
ungrateful
,
when
that
gentleman
endeavoured
to
whisper
a
word
into
his
ear
as
he
passed
through
the
doorway
into
Lady
Monk
's
dining
-
room
.
<EOS>
And
he
had
offered
to
go
abroad
,
 
to
go
abroad
and
leave
his
politics
,
and
his
ambition
,
and
his
coming
honours
.
<EOS>
He
had
persisted
in
his
offer
,
even
after
his
wife
had
suggested
to
him
that
the
Duke
of
St.
Bungay
was
now
in
the
house
with
the
object
of
offering
him
that
very
thing
for
which
he
had
so
longed
!
<EOS>
As
he
thought
of
this
his
heart
became
heavy
within
him
.
<EOS>
Such
chances
,
 
so
he
told
himself
,
 
do
not
come
twice
in
a
man
's
way
.
<EOS>
When
returning
from
a
twelvemonth
's
residence
abroad
he
would
be
nobody
in
politics
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
lost
everything
for
which
he
had
been
working
all
his
life
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
a
man
of
his
word
,
and
as
he
opened
the
library
door
he
was
resolute
,
 
<EOS>
he
thought
that
he
could
be
resolute
in
adhering
to
his
promise
.
  
<EOS>
"
Duke
,
"
he
said
,
"
I
'm
afraid
I
have
kept
you
waiting
.
"
<EOS>
And
the
two
political
allies
shook
each
other
by
the
hand
.
  
<EOS>
The
Duke
was
in
a
glow
of
delight
.
<EOS>
There
had
been
no
waiting
.
<EOS>
He
was
only
too
glad
to
find
his
friend
at
home
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
prepared
to
wait
,
even
if
Mr.
Palliser
had
been
out
.
"
<EOS>
And
I
suppose
you
guess
why
I
'm
come
?
"
said
the
Duke
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
rather
be
told
than
have
to
guess
,
"
said
Mr.
Palliser
,
smiling
for
a
moment
.
<EOS>
But
the
smile
quickly
passed
off
his
face
as
he
remembered
his
pledge
to
his
wife
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
has
resigned
at
last
.
<EOS>
What
was
said
in
the
Lords
last
night
made
it
necessary
that
he
should
do
so
,
or
that
Lord
Brock
should
declare
himself
able
to
support
him
through
thick
and
thin
.
<EOS>
Of
course
,
I
can
tell
you
everything
now
.
<EOS>
He
must
have
gone
,
or
I
must
have
done
so
.
<EOS>
You
know
that
I
do
n't
like
him
in
the
Cabinet
.
<EOS>
I
admire
his
character
and
his
genius
,
but
I
think
him
the
most
dangerous
man
in
England
as
a
statesman
.
<EOS>
He
has
high
principles
,
 
the
very
highest
;
but
they
are
so
high
as
to
be
out
of
sight
to
ordinary
eyes
.
<EOS>
They
are
too
exalted
to
be
of
any
use
for
everyday
purposes
.
<EOS>
He
is
honest
as
the
sun
<EOS>
,
I
'm
sure
;
but
it
's
just
like
the
sun
's
honesty
,
 
of
a
kind
which
we
men
below
ca
n't
quite
understand
or
appreciate
.
<EOS>
He
has
no
instinct
in
politics
,
but
reaches
his
conclusions
by
philosophical
deduction
.
<EOS>
Now
,
in
politics
,
I
would
a
deal
sooner
trust
to
instinct
than
to
calculation
.
<EOS>
I
think
he
may
probably
know
how
England
ought
to
be
governed
three
centuries
hence
better
than
any
man
living
,
but
of
the
proper
way
to
govern
it
now
,
I
think
he
knows
less
.
<EOS>
Brock
half
likes
him
and
half
fears
him
.
<EOS>
He
likes
the
support
of
his
eloquence
,
and
he
likes
the
power
of
the
man
;
but
he
fears
his
restless
activity
,
and
thoroughly
dislikes
his
philosophy
.
<EOS>
At
any
rate
,
he
has
left
us
,
and
I
am
here
to
ask
you
to
take
his
place
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
Duke
,
as
he
concluded
his
speech
,
was
quite
contented
,
and
almost
jovial
.
<EOS>
He
was
thoroughly
satisfied
with
the
new
political
arrangement
which
he
was
proposing
.
<EOS>
He
regarded
Mr.
Palliser
as
a
steady
,
practical
man
of
business
,
luckily
young
,
and
therefore
with
a
deal
of
work
in
him
,
belonging
to
the
race
from
which
English
ministers
ought
,
in
his
opinion
,
to
be
taken
,
and
as
being
,
in
some
respects
,
his
own
pupil
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
the
first
to
declare
aloud
that
Plantagenet
Palliser
was
the
coming
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
;
and
it
had
been
long
known
,
though
no
such
declaration
had
been
made
aloud
,
that
the
Duke
did
not
sit
comfortably
in
the
same
Cabinet
with
the
gentleman
who
had
now
resigned
.
<EOS>
Everything
had
now
gone
as
the
Duke
wished
;
and
he
was
prepared
to
celebrate
some
little
ovation
with
his
young
friend
before
he
left
the
house
in
Park
Lane
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
who
goes
out
with
him
?
"
asked
Mr.
Palliser
,
putting
off
the
evil
moment
of
his
own
decision
;
but
before
the
Duke
could
answer
him
,
he
had
reminded
himself
that
under
his
present
circumstances
he
had
no
right
to
ask
such
a
question
.
<EOS>
His
own
decision
could
not
rest
upon
that
point
.
<EOS>
"
But
it
does
not
matter
,
"
he
said
;
"
I
am
afraid
I
must
decline
the
offer
you
bring
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Decline
it
!
"
said
the
Duke
,
who
could
not
have
been
more
surprised
had
his
friend
talked
of
declining
heaven
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
fear
I
must
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
Duke
had
now
risen
from
his
chair
,
and
was
standing
,
with
both
his
hands
upon
the
table
.
<EOS>
All
his
contentment
,
all
his
joviality
,
had
vanished
.
<EOS>
His
fine
round
face
had
become
almost
ludicrously
long
;
his
eyes
and
mouth
were
struggling
to
convey
reproach
,
and
the
reproach
was
almost
drowned
in
vexation
.
<EOS>
Ever
since
Parliament
had
met
he
had
been
whispering
Mr.
Palliser
's
name
into
the
Prime
Minister
's
ear
,
and
now
 
.
<EOS>
But
he
could
not
,
and
would
not
,
believe
it
.
<EOS>
"
Nonsense
,
Palliser
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
have
got
some
false
notion
into
your
head
.
<EOS>
There
can
be
no
possible
reason
why
you
should
not
join
us
.
<EOS>
Finespun
himself
will
support
us
,
at
any
rate
for
a
time
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Finespun
was
the
gentleman
whose
retirement
from
the
ministry
the
Duke
of
St.
Bungay
had
now
announced
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
nothing
of
that
kind
,
"
said
Mr.
Palliser
,
who
perhaps
felt
himself
quite
equal
to
the
duties
proposed
to
him
,
even
though
Mr.
Finespun
should
not
support
him
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
nothing
of
that
kind
;
 
it
is
no
fear
of
that
sort
that
hinders
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
,
for
mercy
's
sake
,
what
is
it
?
<EOS>
My
dear
Palliser
,
I
looked
upon
you
as
being
as
sure
in
this
matter
as
myself
;
and
I
had
a
right
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
You
certainly
intended
to
join
us
a
month
ago
,
if
the
opportunity
offered
.
<EOS>
You
certainly
did
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
true
,
Duke
.
<EOS>
I
must
ask
you
to
listen
to
me
now
,
and
I
must
tell
you
what
I
would
not
willingly
tell
to
any
man
.
"
<EOS>
As
Mr.
Palliser
said
this
a
look
of
agony
came
over
his
face
.
<EOS>
There
are
men
who
can
talk
easily
of
all
their
most
inmost
matters
,
but
he
was
not
such
a
man
.
<EOS>
It
went
sorely
against
the
grain
with
him
to
speak
of
the
sorrow
of
his
home
,
even
to
such
a
friend
as
the
Duke
;
but
it
was
essentially
necessary
to
him
that
he
should
justify
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
word
,
"
said
the
Duke
,
"
I
ca
n't
understand
that
there
should
be
any
reason
strong
enough
to
make
you
throw
your
party
over
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
promised
to
take
my
wife
abroad
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
that
it
?
"
said
the
Duke
,
looking
at
him
with
surprise
,
but
at
the
same
time
with
something
of
returning
joviality
in
his
face
.
<EOS>
"
Nobody
thinks
of
going
abroad
at
this
time
of
the
year
.
<EOS>
Of
course
,
you
can
get
away
for
a
time
when
Parliament
breaks
up
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
have
promised
to
go
at
once
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Then
,
considering
your
position
,
you
have
made
a
promise
which
it
behoves
you
to
break
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
Lady
Glencora
will
see
it
in
that
light
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
quite
understand
me
,
and
I
am
afraid
I
must
trouble
you
to
listen
to
matters
which
,
under
other
circumstances
,
it
would
be
impertinent
in
me
to
obtrude
upon
you
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
certain
stiffness
of
demeanour
,
and
measured
propriety
of
voice
,
much
at
variance
with
his
former
manner
,
came
upon
him
as
he
said
this
.
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
,
Palliser
,
I
do
n't
want
to
interfere
for
a
moment
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
will
allow
me
,
Duke
.
<EOS>
My
wife
has
told
me
that
,
this
morning
,
which
makes
me
feel
that
absence
from
England
is
requisite
for
her
present
comfort
.
<EOS>
I
was
with
her
when
you
came
,
and
had
just
promised
her
that
she
should
go
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
Palliser
,
think
of
it
.
<EOS>
If
this
were
a
small
matter
,
I
would
not
press
you
;
but
a
man
in
your
position
has
public
duties
.
<EOS>
He
owes
his
services
to
his
country
.
<EOS>
He
has
no
right
to
go
back
,
if
it
be
possible
that
he
should
so
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
When
a
man
has
given
his
word
,
it
can
not
be
right
that
he
should
go
back
from
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
not
.
<EOS>
But
a
man
may
be
absolved
from
a
promise
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
 
"
  
"
My
wife
would
,
of
course
,
absolve
me
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
that
.
<EOS>
Her
happiness
demands
it
,
and
it
is
partly
my
fault
that
it
is
so
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
explain
to
you
more
fully
why
it
is
that
I
must
give
up
the
great
object
for
which
I
have
striven
with
all
my
strength
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
no
!
"
said
the
Duke
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
are
sure
that
it
is
imperative
 
"
  
"
It
is
imperative
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
could
give
you
twenty
-
four
hours
,
you
know
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
did
not
answer
at
once
,
and
the
Duke
thought
that
he
saw
some
sign
of
hesitation
.
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
it
would
not
be
possible
that
I
should
speak
to
Lady
Glencora
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
could
be
of
no
avail
,
Duke
.
<EOS>
She
would
only
declare
,
at
the
first
word
,
that
she
would
remain
in
London
;
but
it
would
not
be
the
less
my
duty
on
that
account
to
take
her
abroad
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
;
I
ca
n't
say
.
<EOS>
Of
course
,
I
ca
n't
say
.
<EOS>
Such
an
opportunity
may
not
come
twice
in
a
man
's
life
.
<EOS>
And
at
your
age
too
!
<EOS>
You
are
throwing
away
from
you
the
finest
political
position
that
the
world
can
offer
to
the
ambition
of
any
man
.
<EOS>
No
one
at
your
time
of
life
has
had
such
a
chance
within
my
memory
.
<EOS>
That
a
man
under
thirty
should
be
thought
fit
to
be
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
,
and
should
refuse
it
,
 
because
he
wants
to
take
his
wife
abroad
!
<EOS>
Palliser
,
if
she
were
dying
,
you
should
remain
under
such
an
emergency
as
this
.
<EOS>
She
might
go
,
but
you
should
remain
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
remained
silent
for
a
moment
or
two
in
his
chair
;
he
then
rose
and
walked
towards
the
window
,
as
he
spoke
.
<EOS>
"
There
are
things
worse
than
death
,
"
he
said
,
when
his
back
was
turned
.
<EOS>
His
voice
was
very
low
,
and
there
was
a
tear
in
his
eye
as
he
spoke
them
;
the
words
were
indeed
whispered
,
but
the
Duke
heard
them
,
and
felt
that
he
could
not
press
him
any
more
on
the
subject
of
his
wife
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
must
this
be
final
?
"
said
the
Duke
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
must
.
<EOS>
But
your
visit
here
has
come
so
quickly
on
my
resolution
to
go
abroad
,
 
which
,
in
truth
,
was
only
made
ten
minutes
before
your
name
was
brought
to
me
,
 
that
I
believe
I
ought
to
ask
for
a
portion
of
those
twenty
-
four
hours
which
you
have
offered
me
.
<EOS>
A
small
portion
will
be
enough
.
<EOS>
Will
you
see
me
,
if
I
come
to
you
this
evening
,
say
at
eight
?
<EOS>
If
the
House
is
up
in
the
Lords
I
will
go
to
you
in
St.
James
's
Square
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
shall
be
sitting
after
eight
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
I
will
see
you
there
.
<EOS>
And
,
Duke
,
I
must
ask
you
to
think
of
me
in
this
matter
as
a
friend
should
think
,
and
not
as
though
we
were
bound
together
only
by
party
feeling
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
,
 
I
will
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
told
you
what
I
shall
never
whisper
to
any
one
else
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
know
that
you
are
safe
with
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
of
it
.
<EOS>
And
,
Duke
,
I
can
tell
you
that
the
sacrifice
to
me
will
be
almost
more
than
I
can
bear
.
<EOS>
This
thing
that
you
have
offered
me
to
-
day
is
the
only
thing
that
I
have
ever
coveted
.
<EOS>
I
have
thought
of
it
and
worked
for
it
,
have
hoped
and
despaired
,
have
for
moments
been
vain
enough
to
think
that
it
was
within
my
strength
,
and
have
been
wretched
for
weeks
together
because
I
have
told
myself
that
it
was
utterly
beyond
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
As
to
that
,
neither
Brock
nor
I
,
nor
any
of
us
,
have
any
doubt
.
<EOS>
Finespun
himself
says
that
you
are
the
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
much
obliged
to
them
.
<EOS>
But
I
say
all
this
simply
that
you
may
understand
how
imperative
is
the
duty
which
,
as
I
think
,
requires
me
to
refuse
the
offer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
have
n't
refused
as
yet
,
"
said
the
Duke
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
wait
at
the
House
for
you
,
whether
they
are
sitting
or
not
.
<EOS>
And
endeavour
to
join
us
.
<EOS>
Do
the
best
you
can
.
<EOS>
I
will
say
nothing
as
to
that
duty
of
which
you
speak
;
but
if
it
can
be
made
compatible
with
your
public
service
,
pray
 
pray
let
it
be
done
.
<EOS>
Remember
how
much
such
a
one
as
you
owes
to
his
country
.
"
<EOS>
Then
the
Duke
went
,
and
Mr.
Palliser
was
alone
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
not
been
alone
before
since
the
revelation
which
had
been
made
to
him
by
his
wife
,
and
the
words
she
had
spoken
were
still
sounding
in
his
ears
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
love
Burgo
Fitzgerald
;
 
I
do
!
<EOS>
I
do
!
<EOS>
I
do
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
They
were
not
pleasant
words
for
a
young
husband
to
hear
.
<EOS>
Men
there
are
,
no
doubt
,
whose
nature
would
make
them
more
miserable
under
the
infliction
than
it
had
made
Plantagenet
Palliser
.
<EOS>
He
was
calm
,
without
strong
passion
,
not
prone
to
give
to
words
a
stronger
significance
than
they
should
bear
;
 
and
he
was
essentially
unsuspicious
.
<EOS>
Never
for
a
moment
had
he
thought
,
even
while
those
words
were
hissing
in
his
ears
,
that
his
wife
had
betrayed
his
honour
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
there
was
that
at
his
heart
,
as
he
remembered
those
words
,
which
made
him
feel
that
the
world
was
almost
too
heavy
for
him
.
<EOS>
For
the
first
quarter
of
an
hour
after
the
Duke
's
departure
he
thought
more
of
his
wife
and
of
Burgo
Fitzgerald
than
he
did
of
Lord
Brock
and
Mr.
Finespun
.
<EOS>
But
of
this
he
was
aware
,
 
that
he
had
forgiven
his
wife
;
that
he
had
put
his
arm
round
her
and
embraced
her
after
hearing
her
confession
,
 
and
that
she
,
mutely
,
with
her
eyes
,
had
promised
him
that
she
would
do
her
best
for
him
.
<EOS>
Then
something
of
an
idea
of
love
came
across
his
heart
,
and
he
acknowledged
to
himself
that
he
had
married
without
loving
or
without
requiring
love
.
<EOS>
Much
of
all
this
had
been
his
own
fault
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
had
not
the
whole
of
it
come
from
his
own
wrong
-
doing
?
<EOS>
He
acknowledged
that
it
was
so
.
<EOS>
But
now
,
 
now
he
loved
her
.
<EOS>
He
felt
that
he
could
not
bear
to
part
with
her
,
even
if
there
were
no
question
of
public
scandal
,
or
of
disgrace
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
torn
inwardly
by
that
assertion
that
she
loved
another
man
.
<EOS>
She
had
got
at
his
heart
-
strings
at
last
.
<EOS>
There
are
men
who
may
love
their
wives
,
though
they
never
can
have
been
in
love
before
their
marriage
.

When
the
Duke
had
been
gone
about
an
hour
,
and
when
,
under
ordinary
circumstances
,
it
would
have
been
his
time
to
go
down
to
the
House
,
he
took
his
hat
and
walked
into
the
Park
.
<EOS>
He
made
his
way
across
Hyde
Park
,
and
into
Kensington
Gardens
,
and
there
he
remained
for
an
hour
,
walking
up
and
down
beneath
the
elms
.
<EOS>
The
quidnuncs
of
the
town
,
who
chanced
to
see
him
,
and
who
had
heard
something
of
the
political
movements
of
the
day
,
thought
,
no
doubt
,
that
he
was
meditating
his
future
ministerial
career
.
<EOS>
But
he
had
not
been
there
long
before
he
had
resolved
that
no
ministerial
career
was
at
present
open
to
him
.
<EOS>
"
It
has
been
my
own
fault
,
"
he
said
,
as
he
returned
to
his
house
,
"
and
with
God
's
help
I
will
mend
it
,
if
it
be
possible
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
But
he
was
a
slow
man
,
and
he
did
not
go
off
instantly
to
the
Duke
.
<EOS>
He
had
given
himself
to
eight
o'clock
,
and
he
took
the
full
time
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
go
down
to
the
House
of
Commons
because
men
would
make
inquiries
of
him
which
he
would
find
it
difficult
to
answer
.
<EOS>
So
he
dined
at
home
,
alone
.
<EOS>
He
had
told
his
wife
that
he
would
see
her
at
nine
,
and
before
that
hour
he
would
not
go
to
her
.
<EOS>
He
sat
alone
till
it
was
time
for
him
to
get
into
his
brougham
,
and
thought
it
all
over
.
<EOS>
That
seat
in
the
Cabinet
and
Chancellorship
of
the
Exchequer
,
which
he
had
so
infinitely
desired
,
were
already
done
with
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
doubt
about
that
.
<EOS>
It
might
have
been
better
for
him
not
to
have
married
;
but
now
that
he
was
married
,
and
that
things
had
brought
him
untowardly
to
this
pass
,
he
knew
that
his
wife
's
safety
was
his
first
duty
.
<EOS>
"
We
will
go
through
Switzerland
,
"
he
said
to
himself
,
"
to
Baden
,
and
then
we
will
get
on
to
Florence
and
to
Rome
.
<EOS>
She
has
seen
nothing
of
all
these
things
yet
,
and
the
new
life
will
make
a
change
in
her
.
<EOS>
She
shall
have
her
own
friend
with
her
.
"
<EOS>
Then
he
went
down
to
the
House
of
Lords
,
and
saw
the
Duke
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Palliser
,
"
said
the
Duke
,
when
he
had
listened
to
him
,
"
<EOS>
of
course
I
can
not
argue
it
with
you
any
more
.
<EOS>
I
can
only
say
that
I
am
very
sorry
;
 
more
sorry
than
perhaps
you
will
believe
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
it
half
breaks
my
heart
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
Duke
's
voice
was
very
sad
,
and
it
might
almost
have
been
thought
that
he
was
going
to
shed
a
tear
.
<EOS>
In
truth
he
disliked
Mr.
Finespun
with
the
strongest
political
feeling
of
which
he
was
capable
,
and
had
attached
himself
to
Mr.
Palliser
almost
as
strongly
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
thousand
pities
!
<EOS>
How
hard
had
he
not
worked
to
bring
about
this
arrangement
,
which
was
now
to
be
upset
because
a
woman
had
been
foolish
!
<EOS>
"
I
never
above
half
liked
her
,
"
said
the
Duke
to
himself
,
thinking
perhaps
a
little
of
the
Duchess
's
complaints
of
her
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
go
to
Brock
at
once
,
"
he
said
aloud
,
"
and
tell
him
.
<EOS>
God
knows
what
we
must
do
now
.
<EOS>
Goodbye
!
<EOS>
good
-
bye
!
<EOS>
No
;
I
'm
not
angry
.
<EOS>
There
shall
be
no
quarrel
.
<EOS>
But
I
am
very
sorry
.
<EOS>
"
In
this
way
the
two
politicians
parted
.
  
<EOS>
We
may
as
well
follow
this
political
movement
to
its
end
.
<EOS>
The
Duke
saw
Lord
Brock
that
night
,
and
then
those
two
ministers
sent
for
another
minister
,
 
another
noble
Lord
,
a
man
of
great
experience
in
Cabinets
.
<EOS>
These
three
discussed
the
matter
together
,
and
on
the
following
day
Lord
Brock
got
up
in
the
House
,
and
made
a
strong
speech
in
defence
of
his
colleague
,
Mr.
Finespun
.
<EOS>
To
the
end
of
the
Session
,
at
any
rate
,
Mr.
Finespun
kept
his
position
,
and
held
the
seals
of
the
Exchequer
while
all
the
quidnuncs
of
the
nation
,
shaking
their
heads
,
spoke
of
the
wonderful
power
of
Mr.
Finespun
,
and
declared
that
Lord
Brock
did
not
dare
to
face
the
Opposition
without
him
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
Mr.
Palliser
had
returned
to
his
wife
,
and
told
her
of
his
resolution
with
reference
to
their
tour
abroad
.
<EOS>
"
We
may
as
well
make
up
our
minds
to
start
at
once
,
"
said
he
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
At
any
rate
,
there
is
nothing
on
my
side
to
hinder
us
.

Alice
Vavasor
's
Name
Gets
into
the
Money
Market
.
 
<EOS>
Some
ten
or
twelve
days
after
George
Vavasor
's
return
to
London
from
Westmoreland
he
appeared
at
Mr.
Scruby
's
offices
with
four
small
slips
of
paper
in
his
hand
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Scruby
,
as
usual
,
was
pressing
for
money
.
<EOS>
The
third
election
was
coming
on
,
and
money
was
already
being
spent
very
freely
among
the
men
of
the
River
Bank
.
<EOS>
So
,
at
least
,
Mr.
Scruby
declared
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Grimes
,
of
the
"
Handsome
Man
,
"
had
shown
signs
of
returning
allegiance
.
<EOS>
But
Mr.
Grimes
could
not
afford
to
be
loyal
without
money
.
<EOS>
He
had
his
little
family
to
protect
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Scruby
,
too
,
had
his
little
family
,
and
was
not
ashamed
to
use
it
on
this
occasion
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
a
family
man
,
Mr.
Vavasor
,
and
therefore
I
never
run
any
risks
.
<EOS>
I
never
go
a
yard
further
than
I
can
see
my
way
back
.
<EOS>
"
This
he
had
said
in
answer
to
a
proposition
that
he
should
take
George
's
note
of
hand
for
the
expenses
of
the
next
election
,
payable
in
three
months
"
time
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
so
very
hard
to
realize
,
"
said
George
,
"
immediately
upon
a
death
,
when
all
the
property
left
is
real
property
.
"
<EOS>
"
Very
hard
indeed
,
"
said
Mr.
Scruby
,
who
had
heard
with
accuracy
all
the
particulars
of
the
old
Squire
's
will
.
<EOS>
Vavasor
understood
the
lawyer
,
cursed
him
inwardly
,
and
suggested
to
himself
that
some
day
he
might
murder
Mr.
Scruby
as
well
as
John
Grey
,
 
and
perhaps
also
a
few
more
of
his
enemies
.
<EOS>
Two
days
after
the
interview
in
which
his
own
note
of
hand
had
been
refused
,
he
again
called
in
Great
Marlborough
Street
.
<EOS>
Upon
this
occasion
he
tendered
to
Mr.
Scruby
for
his
approval
the
four
slips
of
paper
which
have
been
mentioned
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Scruby
regarded
them
with
attention
,
looking
first
at
one
side
horizontally
,
and
then
at
the
other
side
perpendicularly
.
<EOS>
But
before
we
learn
the
judgement
pronounced
by
Mr.
Scruby
as
to
these
four
slips
of
paper
,
we
must
go
back
to
their
earlier
history
.
<EOS>
As
they
were
still
in
their
infancy
,
we
shall
not
have
to
go
back
far
.
  
<EOS>
One
morning
,
at
about
eleven
o'clock
the
parlour
-
maid
came
up
to
Alice
,
as
she
sat
alone
in
the
drawing
-
room
in
Queen
Anne
Street
,
and
told
her
there
was
a
"
gentleman
"
in
the
hall
waiting
to
be
seen
by
her
.
<EOS>
We
all
know
the
tone
in
which
servants
announce
a
gentleman
when
they
know
that
the
gentleman
is
not
a
gentleman
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
gentleman
wanting
to
see
me
!
<EOS>
What
sort
of
a
gentleman
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
miss
,
I
do
n't
think
he
's
just
of
our
sort
;
but
he
's
decent
to
look
at
.
"
  
<EOS>
Alice
Vavasor
had
no
desire
to
deny
herself
to
any
person
but
one
.
<EOS>
She
was
well
aware
that
the
gentleman
in
the
hall
could
not
be
her
cousin
George
,
and
therefore
she
did
not
refuse
to
see
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Let
him
come
up
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
think
,
Jane
,
you
ought
to
ask
him
his
name
.
<EOS>
"
Jane
did
ask
him
his
name
,
and
came
back
immediately
,
announcing
Mr.
Levy
.
  
<EOS>
This
occurred
immediately
after
the
return
of
Mr.
John
Vavasor
from
Westmoreland
.
<EOS>
He
had
reached
home
late
on
the
preceding
evening
,
and
at
the
moment
of
Mr.
Levy
's
call
was
in
his
dressing
-
room
.
  
<EOS>
Alice
got
up
to
receive
her
visitor
,
and
at
once
understood
the
tone
of
her
maid
's
voice
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Levy
was
certainly
not
a
gentleman
of
the
sort
to
which
she
had
been
most
accustomed
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
little
dark
man
,
with
sharp
eyes
,
set
very
near
to
each
other
in
his
head
,
with
a
beaked
nose
,
thick
at
the
bridge
,
and
a
black
moustache
,
but
no
other
beard
.
<EOS>
Alice
did
not
at
all
like
the
look
of
Mr.
Levy
,
but
she
stood
up
to
receive
him
,
made
him
a
little
bow
,
and
asked
him
to
sit
down
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
papa
dressed
yet
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Alice
asked
the
servant
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
miss
,
I
do
n't
think
he
is
,
 
not
to
say
dressed
.
"
  
<EOS>
Alice
had
thought
it
might
be
as
well
that
Mr.
Levy
should
know
that
there
was
a
gentleman
in
the
house
with
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
've
called
about
a
little
bit
of
business
,
miss
,
"
said
Mr.
Levy
,
when
they
were
alone
.
<EOS>
"
Nothing
as
you
need
disturb
yourself
about
.
<EOS>
You
'll
find
it
all
square
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
"
Then
he
took
a
case
out
of
his
breast
-
pocket
,
and
produced
a
note
,
which
he
handed
to
her
.
<EOS>
Alice
took
the
note
,
and
saw
immediately
that
it
was
addressed
to
her
by
her
cousin
George
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
Mr.
George
Vavasor
,
"
said
Mr.
Levy
.
<EOS>
"
I
dare
say
you
never
saw
me
before
,
miss
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
<EOS>
;
I
think
not
,
"
said
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
your
cousin
's
clerk
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
you
're
Mr.
Vavasor
's
clerk
.
<EOS>
I
'll
read
his
letter
,
if
you
please
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
please
,
miss
.
"
  
<EOS>
George
Vavasor
's
letter
to
his
cousin
was
as
follows
:
    
<EOS>
DEAR
ALICE
,
  
<EOS>
After
what
passed
between
us
when
I
last
saw
you
<EOS>
I
thought
that
on
my
return
from
Westmoreland
I
should
learn
that
you
had
paid
in
at
my
bankers
"
the
money
that
I
require
.
<EOS>
But
I
find
that
this
is
not
so
;
and
of
course
I
excuse
you
,
because
women
so
seldom
know
when
or
how
to
do
that
which
business
demands
of
them
.
<EOS>
You
have
,
no
doubt
,
heard
the
injustice
which
my
grandfather
has
done
me
,
and
will
probably
feel
as
indignant
as
I
do
.
<EOS>
I
only
mention
this
now
,
because
the
nature
of
his
will
makes
it
more
than
ever
incumbent
on
you
that
you
should
be
true
to
your
pledge
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
Till
there
shall
be
some
ground
for
a
better
understanding
between
us
,
 
and
this
I
do
not
doubt
will
come
,
 
<EOS>
I
think
it
wiser
not
to
call
,
myself
,
at
Queen
Anne
Street
.
<EOS>
I
therefore
send
my
confidential
clerk
with
four
bills
,
each
of
five
hundred
pounds
,
drawn
at
fourteen
days
"
date
,
across
which
I
will
get
you
to
write
your
name
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Levy
will
show
you
the
way
in
which
this
should
be
done
.
<EOS>
Your
name
must
come
under
the
word
"
accepted
,
"
and
just
above
the
name
of
Messrs.
Drummonds
,
where
the
money
must
be
lying
ready
,
at
any
rate
,
not
later
than
Monday
fortnight
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
the
money
must
be
there
some
time
on
the
Saturday
.
<EOS>
They
know
you
so
well
at
Drummonds
"
that
you
will
not
object
to
call
on
the
Saturday
afternoon
,
and
ask
if
it
is
all
right
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
certainly
been
inconvenienced
by
not
finding
the
money
as
I
expected
on
my
return
to
town
.
<EOS>
If
these
bills
are
not
properly
provided
for
,
the
result
will
be
very
disastrous
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
feel
,
however
,
sure
that
this
will
be
done
,
both
for
your
own
sake
and
for
mine
.
  
<EOS>
Affectionately
yours
,
  
GEORGE
VAVASOR
.
  
<EOS>
The
unparalleled
impudence
of
this
letter
had
the
effect
which
the
writer
had
intended
.
<EOS>
It
made
Alice
think
immediately
of
her
own
remissness
,
 
if
she
had
been
remiss
,
 
rather
than
of
the
enormity
of
his
claim
upon
her
.
<EOS>
The
decision
with
which
he
asked
for
her
money
,
without
any
pretence
at
an
excuse
on
his
part
,
did
for
the
time
induce
her
to
believe
that
she
had
no
alternative
but
to
give
it
to
him
,
and
that
she
had
been
wrong
in
delaying
it
.
<EOS>
She
had
told
him
that
he
should
have
it
,
and
she
ought
to
have
been
as
good
as
her
word
.
<EOS>
She
should
not
have
forced
upon
him
the
necessity
of
demanding
it
.
  
<EOS>
But
the
idea
of
signing
four
bills
was
terrible
to
her
,
and
she
felt
sure
that
she
ought
not
to
put
her
name
to
orders
for
so
large
an
amount
and
then
intrust
them
to
such
a
man
as
Mr.
Levy
.
<EOS>
Her
father
was
in
the
house
,
and
she
might
have
asked
him
.
<EOS>
The
thought
that
she
would
do
so
of
course
occurred
to
her
.
<EOS>
But
then
it
occurred
to
her
also
that
were
she
to
speak
to
her
father
as
to
this
advancing
of
money
to
her
cousin
,
 
to
this
giving
of
money
,
<EOS>
for
she
now
well
understood
that
it
would
be
a
gift
;
 
were
she
to
consult
her
father
in
any
way
about
it
,
he
would
hinder
her
,
not
only
from
signing
the
bills
for
Mr.
Levy
,
but
,
as
far
as
he
could
do
so
,
from
keeping
the
promise
made
to
her
cousin
.
<EOS>
She
was
resolved
that
George
should
have
the
money
,
and
she
knew
that
she
could
give
it
to
him
in
spite
of
her
father
.
<EOS>
But
her
father
might
probably
be
able
to
delay
the
gift
,
and
thus
rob
it
of
its
chief
value
.
<EOS>
If
she
were
to
sign
the
bills
,
the
money
must
be
made
to
be
forthcoming
.
<EOS>
So
much
she
understood
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Levy
had
taken
out
the
four
bills
from
the
same
case
,
and
had
placed
them
on
the
table
before
him
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Vavasor
has
explained
,
I
believe
,
miss
,
<EOS>
what
it
is
you
have
to
do
?
<EOS>
"
he
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
;
my
cousin
has
explained
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
there
is
nothing
else
to
trouble
you
with
,
I
believe
.
<EOS>
If
you
will
just
write
your
name
across
them
,
here
,
I
need
not
detain
you
by
staying
any
longer
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Levy
was
very
anxious
to
make
his
visit
as
short
as
possible
,
since
he
had
heard
that
Mr.
John
Vavasor
was
in
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
But
Alice
hesitated
.
<EOS>
Two
thousand
pounds
is
a
very
serious
sum
of
money
.
<EOS>
She
had
heard
much
of
sharpers
,
and
thought
that
she
ought
to
be
cautious
.
<EOS>
What
if
this
man
,
of
whom
she
had
never
before
heard
,
should
steal
the
bills
after
she
had
signed
them
?
<EOS>
She
looked
again
at
her
cousin
's
letter
,
chiefly
with
the
object
of
gaining
time
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
all
right
,
miss
,
"
said
Mr.
Levy
.
  
<EOS>
"
Could
you
not
leave
them
with
me
,
sir
?
"
said
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
;
not
very
well
,
miss
.
<EOS>
No
doubt
Mr.
Vavasor
has
explained
it
all
;
but
the
fact
is
,
he
must
have
them
this
afternoon
.
<EOS>
He
has
got
a
heavy
sum
to
put
down
on
the
nail
about
this
here
election
,
and
if
it
ai
n't
down
to
-
day
,
them
on
whom
he
has
to
depend
will
be
all
abroad
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
sir
,
the
money
will
not
be
payable
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
If
I
understand
it
,
they
are
not
cheques
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
miss
,
no
;
they
are
not
cheques
.
<EOS>
But
your
name
,
miss
,
at
fourteen
days
,
is
the
same
as
ready
money
;
 
just
the
same
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
paused
,
and
while
she
paused
,
he
reached
a
pen
for
her
from
the
writing
-
table
,
and
then
she
signed
the
four
bills
as
he
held
them
before
her
.
<EOS>
She
was
quick
enough
at
doing
this
when
she
had
once
commenced
the
work
.
<EOS>
Her
object
,
then
,
was
that
the
man
should
be
gone
from
the
house
before
her
father
could
meet
him
.
  
<EOS>
These
were
the
four
bits
of
paper
which
George
Vavasor
tendered
to
Mr.
Scruby
's
notice
on
the
occasion
which
we
have
now
in
hand
.
<EOS>
In
doing
so
,
he
made
use
of
them
after
the
manner
of
a
grand
capitalist
,
who
knows
that
he
may
assume
certain
airs
as
he
allows
the
odours
of
the
sweetness
of
his
wealth
to
drop
from
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
insisted
on
ready
money
,
with
your
d
 
---
suspicions
,
"
said
he
;
"
and
there
it
is
.
<EOS>
You
're
not
afraid
of
fourteen
days
,
I
dare
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Fourteen
days
is
neither
here
nor
there
,
"
said
Mr.
Scruby
.
<EOS>
"
We
can
let
our
payments
stand
over
as
long
as
that
,
without
doing
any
harm
.
<EOS>
I
'll
send
one
of
my
men
down
to
Grimes
,
and
tell
him
I
ca
n't
see
him
,
till
,
 
<EOS>
let
me
see
,
"
and
he
looked
at
one
of
the
bills
,
"
till
the
15th
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
But
this
was
not
exactly
what
George
Vavasor
wanted
.
<EOS>
He
was
desirous
that
the
bills
should
be
immediately
turned
into
money
,
so
that
the
necessity
of
forcing
payments
from
Alice
,
should
due
provision
for
the
bills
not
be
made
,
might
fall
into
other
hands
than
his
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
can
wait
till
the
15th
,
"
said
Scruby
,
as
he
handed
the
bits
of
paper
back
to
his
customer
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
want
a
thousand
,
you
say
?
"
said
George
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
thousand
to
begin
with
.
<EOS>
Certainly
not
less
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
you
had
better
keep
two
of
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
 
no
!
<EOS>
I
do
n't
see
the
use
of
that
.
<EOS>
You
had
better
collect
them
through
your
own
banker
,
and
let
me
have
a
cheque
on
the
15th
or
16th
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
cursed
suspicious
you
are
,
Scruby
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
ai
n't
.
<EOS>
I
'm
not
a
bit
suspicious
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
deal
in
such
articles
;
that
's
all
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
doubt
can
there
be
about
such
bills
as
those
?
<EOS>
Everybody
knows
that
my
cousin
has
a
considerable
fortune
,
altogether
at
her
own
disposal
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
truth
is
,
Mr.
Vavasor
,
that
bills
with
ladies
"
names
on
them
,
 
ladies
who
are
no
way
connected
with
business
,
 
ai
n't
just
the
paper
that
people
like
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nothing
on
earth
can
be
surer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
take
them
into
the
City
for
discount
,
and
see
if
the
bankers
do
n't
tell
you
the
same
.
<EOS>
They
may
be
done
,
of
course
,
upon
your
name
.
<EOS>
I
say
nothing
about
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
explain
to
you
the
nature
of
the
family
arrangement
,
but
I
ca
n't
do
that
to
a
stranger
.
<EOS>
However
,
I
do
n't
mind
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
not
.
<EOS>
The
time
is
so
short
that
it
does
not
signify
.
<EOS>
Have
them
collected
through
your
own
bankers
,
and
then
,
if
it
do
n't
suit
you
to
call
,
send
me
a
cheque
for
a
thousand
pounds
when
the
time
is
up
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Then
Mr.
Scruby
turned
to
some
papers
on
his
right
hand
,
as
though
the
interview
had
been
long
enough
.
<EOS>
Vavasor
looked
at
him
angrily
,
opening
his
wound
at
him
and
cursing
him
inwardly
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Scruby
went
on
with
his
paper
,
by
no
means
regarding
either
the
wound
or
the
unspoken
curses
.
<EOS>
Thereupon
Vavasor
got
up
and
went
away
without
any
word
of
farewell
.
  
<EOS>
As
he
walked
along
Great
Marlborough
Street
,
and
through
those
unalluring
streets
which
surround
the
Soho
district
,
and
so
on
to
the
Strand
and
his
own
lodgings
,
he
still
continued
to
think
of
some
wide
scheme
of
revenge
,
 
of
some
scheme
in
which
Mr.
Scruby
might
be
included
.
<EOS>
There
had
appeared
something
latterly
in
Mr.
Scruby
's
manner
to
him
,
something
of
mingled
impatience
and
familiarity
,
which
made
him
feel
that
he
had
fallen
in
the
attorney
's
estimation
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
that
the
lawyer
thought
him
to
be
less
honourable
,
or
less
clever
,
than
he
had
before
thought
him
;
but
that
the
man
was
like
a
rat
,
and
knew
a
falling
house
by
the
instinct
that
was
in
him
.
<EOS>
So
George
Vavasor
cursed
Mr.
Scruby
,
and
calculated
some
method
of
murdering
him
without
detection
.
  
<EOS>
The
reader
is
not
to
suppose
that
the
Member
for
the
Chelsea
Districts
had
,
in
truth
,
resolved
to
gratify
his
revenge
by
murder
,
 
by
murdering
any
of
those
persons
whom
he
hated
so
vigorously
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
,
himself
,
think
it
probable
that
he
would
become
a
murderer
.
<EOS>
But
he
received
some
secret
satisfaction
in
allowing
his
mind
to
dwell
upon
the
subject
,
and
in
making
those
calculations
.
<EOS>
He
reflected
that
it
would
not
do
to
take
off
Scruby
and
John
Grey
at
the
same
time
,
as
it
would
be
known
that
he
was
connected
with
both
of
them
;
unless
,
indeed
,
he
was
to
take
off
a
third
person
at
the
same
time
,
 
a
third
person
,
as
to
the
expediency
of
ending
whose
career
he
made
his
calculations
quite
as
often
as
he
did
in
regard
to
any
of
those
persons
whom
he
cursed
so
often
.
<EOS>
It
need
hardly
be
explained
to
the
reader
that
this
third
person
was
the
sitting
Member
for
the
Chelsea
Districts
.
  
<EOS>
As
he
was
himself
in
want
of
instant
ready
money
<EOS>
Mr.
Scruby
's
proposition
that
he
should
leave
the
four
bills
at
his
own
bankers
"
,
to
be
collected
when
they
came
to
maturity
,
did
not
suit
him
.
<EOS>
He
doubted
much
,
also
,
whether
at
the
end
of
the
fourteen
days
the
money
would
be
forthcoming
.
<EOS>
Alice
would
be
driven
to
tell
her
father
,
in
order
that
the
money
might
be
procured
,
and
John
Vavasor
would
probably
succeed
in
putting
impediments
in
the
way
of
the
payment
.
<EOS>
He
must
take
the
bills
into
the
City
,
and
do
the
best
there
that
he
could
with
them
.
<EOS>
He
was
too
late
for
this
to
-
day
,
and
therefore
he
went
to
his
lodgings
,
and
then
down
to
the
House
.
<EOS>
In
the
House
he
sat
all
the
night
with
his
hat
over
his
eyes
,
making
those
little
calculations
of
which
I
have
spoken
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
heard
the
news
;
have
n't
you
?
"
said
Mr.
Bott
to
him
,
whispering
in
his
ear
.
  
<EOS>
"
News
;
no
.
<EOS>
I
have
n't
heard
any
news
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Finespun
has
resigned
,
and
Palliser
is
at
this
moment
with
the
Duke
of
St.
Bungay
in
the
Lords
"
library
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
may
both
be
at
the
bottom
of
the
Lords
"
fishpond
,
for
what
I
care
,
"
said
Vavasor
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
nonsense
,
you
know
,
"
said
Bott
.
<EOS>
"
Still
,
you
know
Palliser
is
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
at
this
moment
.
<EOS>
What
a
lucky
fellow
you
are
to
have
such
a
chance
come
to
you
<EOS>
directly
you
get
in
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
he
takes
his
seat
down
there
,
of
course
we
shall
go
up
behind
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
shall
have
another
election
in
a
month
's
time
,
"
said
George
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
safe
enough
,
"
said
Bott
.
<EOS>
"
It
never
hurts
a
man
at
elections
to
be
closely
connected
with
the
Government
.
"
  
<EOS>
George
Vavasor
was
in
the
City
by
times
the
next
morning
,
but
he
found
that
the
City
did
not
look
with
favourable
eyes
on
his
four
bills
.
<EOS>
The
City
took
them
up
,
first
horizontally
,
and
then
,
with
a
twist
of
its
hand
,
perpendicularly
,
and
looked
at
them
with
distrustful
eyes
.
<EOS>
The
City
repeated
the
name
,
Alice
Vavasor
,
as
though
it
were
not
esteemed
a
good
name
on
Change
.
<EOS>
The
City
suggested
that
as
the
time
was
so
short
,
the
holder
of
the
bills
would
be
wise
to
hold
them
till
he
could
collect
the
amount
.
<EOS>
It
was
very
clear
that
the
City
suspected
something
wrong
in
the
transaction
.
<EOS>
The
City
,
by
one
of
its
mouths
,
asserted
plainly
that
ladies
"
bills
never
meant
business
.
<EOS>
George
Vavasor
cursed
the
City
,
and
made
his
calculation
about
murdering
it
.
<EOS>
Might
not
a
river
of
strychnine
be
turned
on
round
the
Exchange
about
luncheon
time
?
<EOS>
Three
of
the
bills
he
left
at
last
with
his
own
bankers
for
collection
,
and
retained
the
fourth
in
his
breast
-
pocket
,
intending
on
the
morrow
to
descend
with
it
into
those
lower
depths
of
the
money
market
which
he
had
not
as
yet
visited
.
<EOS>
Again
,
on
the
next
day
,
he
went
to
work
and
succeeded
to
some
extent
.
<EOS>
Among
those
lower
depths
he
found
a
capitalist
who
was
willing
to
advance
him
two
hundred
pounds
,
keeping
that
fourth
bill
in
his
possession
as
security
.
<EOS>
The
capitalist
was
to
have
forty
pounds
for
the
transaction
,
and
George
cursed
him
as
he
took
his
cheque
.
<EOS>
George
Vavasor
knew
quite
enough
of
the
commercial
world
to
enable
him
to
understand
that
a
man
must
be
in
a
very
bad
condition
when
he
consents
to
pay
forty
pounds
for
the
use
of
two
hundred
for
fourteen
days
.
<EOS>
He
cursed
the
City
.
<EOS>
He
cursed
the
House
of
Commons
.
<EOS>
He
cursed
his
cousin
Alice
and
his
sister
Kate
.
<EOS>
He
cursed
the
memory
of
his
grandfather
.
<EOS>
And
he
cursed
himself
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Levy
had
hardly
left
the
house
in
Queen
Anne
Street
,
before
Alice
had
told
her
father
what
she
had
done
.
<EOS>
"
The
money
must
be
forthcoming
,
"
said
Alice
.
<EOS>
To
this
her
father
made
no
immediate
reply
,
but
turning
himself
in
his
chair
away
from
her
with
a
sudden
start
,
sat
looking
at
the
fire
and
shaking
his
head
.
<EOS>
"
The
money
must
be
made
to
be
forthcoming
,
"
said
Alice
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Papa
,
will
you
see
that
it
is
done
?
<EOS>
"
This
was
very
hard
upon
poor
John
Vavasor
,
and
so
he
felt
it
to
be
.
<EOS>
"
Papa
,
if
you
will
not
promise
,
I
must
go
to
Mr.
Round
about
it
myself
,
and
must
find
out
a
broker
to
sell
out
for
me
.
<EOS>
You
would
not
wish
that
my
name
should
be
dishonoured
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
be
ruined
,
"
said
he
,
"
and
for
such
a
rascal
as
that
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Never
mind
whether
he
is
a
rascal
or
not
,
papa
.
<EOS>
You
must
acknowledge
that
he
has
been
treated
harshly
by
his
grandfather
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
that
will
was
the
wisest
thing
my
father
ever
did
.
<EOS>
Had
he
left
the
estate
to
George
,
there
would
n't
have
been
an
acre
of
it
left
in
the
family
in
six
months
"
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
the
life
interest
,
papa
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
would
have
raised
all
he
could
upon
that
,
and
it
would
have
done
him
no
good
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
At
any
rate
,
papa
,
he
must
have
this
two
thousand
pounds
.
<EOS>
You
must
promise
me
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
then
he
will
want
more
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
I
do
not
think
he
will
ask
for
more
.
<EOS>
At
any
rate
,
I
do
not
think
that
I
am
bound
to
give
him
all
that
I
have
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
think
not
.
<EOS>
I
should
like
to
know
how
you
can
be
bound
to
give
him
anything
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Because
I
promised
it
.
<EOS>
I
have
signed
the
bills
now
,
and
it
must
be
done
.
"
<EOS>
Still
Mr.
Vavasor
made
no
promise
.
<EOS>
"
Papa
,
if
you
will
not
say
that
you
will
do
it
,
I
must
go
down
to
Mr.
Round
at
once
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
that
I
can
do
it
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
that
Mr.
Round
can
do
it
.
<EOS>
Your
money
is
chiefly
on
mortgage
.
"
<EOS>
Then
there
was
a
pause
for
a
moment
in
the
conversation
.
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
word
,
I
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
in
my
life
,
"
said
Mr.
Vavasor
;
"
I
never
did
.
<EOS>
Four
thousand
pounds
given
away
to
such
a
man
as
that
,
in
three
months
!
<EOS>
Four
thousand
pounds
!
<EOS>
And
you
say
you
do
not
intend
to
marry
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Certainly
not
<EOS>
;
all
that
is
over
.
"
  
"
And
does
he
know
that
it
is
over
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
he
does
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
suppose
so
!
<EOS>
Things
of
that
sort
are
so
often
over
with
you
!
"
<EOS>
This
was
very
cruel
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
she
had
deserved
the
reproach
,
but
still
it
was
very
cruel
.
<EOS>
The
blow
struck
her
with
such
force
that
she
staggered
under
it
.
<EOS>
Tears
came
into
her
eyes
,
and
she
could
hardly
speak
lest
she
should
betray
herself
by
sobbing
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
that
I
have
behaved
badly
,
"
she
said
at
last
;
"
but
I
am
punished
,
and
you
might
spare
me
now
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
want
to
punish
you
,
"
he
said
,
getting
up
from
his
chair
and
walking
about
the
room
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
want
to
punish
you
.
<EOS>
But
,
I
do
n't
want
to
see
you
ruined
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
go
to
Mr.
Round
then
,
myself
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Vavasor
went
on
walking
about
the
room
,
jingling
the
money
in
his
trousers
-
pockets
,
and
pushing
the
chairs
about
as
he
chanced
to
meet
them
.
<EOS>
At
last
,
he
made
a
compromise
with
her
.
<EOS>
He
would
take
a
day
to
think
whether
he
would
assist
her
in
getting
the
money
,
and
communicate
his
decision
to
her
on
the
following
morning
.
   
<EOS>
The
Bills
Are
Made
All
Right
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Vavasor
was
at
his
wits
"
end
about
his
daughter
.
<EOS>
She
had
put
her
name
to
four
bills
for
five
hundred
pounds
each
,
and
had
demanded
from
him
,
almost
without
an
apology
,
his
aid
in
obtaining
money
to
meet
them
.
<EOS>
And
she
might
put
her
name
to
any
other
number
of
bills
,
and
for
any
amount
!
<EOS>
There
was
no
knowing
how
a
man
ought
to
behave
to
such
a
daughter
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
want
her
money
,
"
the
father
said
to
himself
;
"
and
if
she
had
got
none
of
her
own
,
I
would
make
her
as
comfortable
as
I
could
with
my
own
income
.
<EOS>
But
to
see
her
throw
her
money
away
in
such
a
fashion
as
this
is
enough
to
break
a
man
's
heart
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Vavasor
went
to
his
office
in
Chancery
Lane
,
but
he
did
not
go
to
the
chambers
of
Mr.
Round
,
the
lawyer
.
<EOS>
Instead
of
calling
on
Mr.
Round
he
sent
a
note
by
a
messenger
to
Suffolk
Street
,
and
the
answer
to
the
note
came
in
the
person
of
Mr.
Grey
.
<EOS>
John
Grey
was
living
in
town
in
these
days
,
and
was
in
the
habit
of
seeing
Mr.
Vavasor
frequently
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
he
had
not
left
London
since
the
memorable
occasion
on
which
he
had
pitched
his
rival
down
the
tailor
's
stairs
at
his
lodgings
.
<EOS>
He
had
made
himself
pretty
well
conversant
with
George
Vavasor
's
career
,
and
had
often
shuddered
as
he
thought
what
might
be
the
fate
of
any
girl
who
might
trust
herself
to
marry
such
a
man
as
that
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
been
at
home
when
Mr.
Vavasor
's
note
had
reached
his
lodgings
,
and
had
instantly
walked
off
towards
Chancery
Lane
.
<EOS>
He
knew
his
way
to
Mr.
Vavasor
's
signing
-
office
very
accurately
,
for
he
had
acquired
a
habit
of
calling
there
,
and
of
talking
to
the
father
about
his
daughter
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
patient
,
persevering
man
,
confident
in
himself
,
and
apt
to
trust
that
he
would
accomplish
those
things
which
he
attempted
,
though
he
was
hardly
himself
aware
of
any
such
aptitude
.
<EOS>
He
had
never
despaired
as
to
Alice
.
<EOS>
And
though
he
had
openly
acknowledged
to
himself
that
she
had
been
very
foolish
,
 
or
rather
,
that
her
judgement
had
failed
her
,
 
he
had
never
in
truth
been
angry
with
her
.
<EOS>
He
had
looked
upon
her
rejection
of
himself
,
and
her
subsequent
promise
to
her
cousin
,
as
the
effects
of
a
mental
hallucination
,
very
much
to
be
lamented
,
 
to
be
wept
for
,
perhaps
,
through
a
whole
life
,
as
a
source
of
terrible
sorrow
to
himself
and
to
her
.
<EOS>
But
he
regarded
it
all
as
a
disease
,
of
which
the
cure
was
yet
possible
,
 
as
a
disease
which
,
though
it
might
never
leave
the
patient
as
strong
as
she
was
before
,
might
still
leave
her
altogether
.
<EOS>
And
as
he
would
still
have
clung
to
his
love
had
she
been
attacked
by
any
of
those
illnesses
for
which
doctors
have
well
-
known
names
,
so
would
he
cling
to
her
now
that
she
was
attacked
by
a
malady
for
which
no
name
was
known
.
<EOS>
He
had
already
heard
from
Mr.
Vavasor
that
Alice
had
discovered
how
impossible
it
was
that
she
should
marry
her
cousin
,
and
,
in
his
quiet
,
patient
,
enduring
way
,
was
beginning
to
feel
confident
that
he
would
,
at
last
,
carry
his
mistress
off
with
him
to
Nethercoats
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
certainly
a
melancholy
place
,
that
signing
-
office
,
in
which
Mr.
John
Vavasor
was
doomed
to
spend
twelve
hours
a
week
,
during
every
term
time
,
of
his
existence
.
<EOS>
Whether
any
man
could
really
pass
an
existence
of
work
in
such
a
workshop
,
and
not
have
gone
mad
,
 
could
have
endured
to
work
there
for
seven
hours
a
day
,
every
week
-
day
of
his
life
,
I
am
not
prepared
to
say
.
<EOS>
I
doubt
much
whether
any
victims
are
so
doomed
.
<EOS>
I
have
so
often
wandered
through
those
gloomy
passages
without
finding
a
sign
of
humanity
there
,
 
without
hearing
any
slightest
tick
of
the
hammer
of
labour
,
that
I
am
disposed
to
think
that
Lord
Chancellors
have
been
anxious
to
save
their
subordinates
from
suicide
,
and
have
mercifully
decreed
that
the
whole
staff
of
labourers
,
down
to
the
very
message
boys
of
the
office
,
should
be
sent
away
to
green
fields
or
palatial
clubs
during
,
at
any
rate
,
a
moiety
of
their
existence
.
  
<EOS>
The
dismal
set
of
chambers
,
in
which
the
most
dismal
room
had
been
assigned
to
Mr.
Vavasor
,
was
not
actually
in
Chancery
Lane
.
<EOS>
Opening
off
from
Chancery
Lane
are
various
other
small
lanes
,
quiet
,
dingy
nooks
,
<EOS>
some
of
them
in
the
guise
of
streets
going
no
whither
,
some
being
thoroughfares
to
other
dingy
streets
beyond
,
in
which
sponging
-
houses
abound
,
and
others
existing
as
the
entrances
to
so
-
called
Inns
of
Court
,
 
inns
of
which
all
knowledge
has
for
years
been
lost
to
the
outer
world
of
the
laity
,
and
,
as
I
believe
,
lost
almost
equally
to
the
inner
world
of
the
legal
profession
.
<EOS>
Who
has
ever
heard
of
Symonds
"
<EOS>
Inn
?
<EOS>
But
an
ancestral
Symonds
,
celebrated
,
no
doubt
,
in
his
time
,
did
found
an
inn
,
and
there
it
is
to
this
day
.
<EOS>
Of
Staples
"
Inn
,
who
knows
the
purposes
or
use
?
<EOS>
Who
are
its
members
,
and
what
do
they
do
as
such
?
<EOS>
And
Staples
<EOS>
"
Inn
is
an
inn
with
pretensions
,
having
a
chapel
of
its
own
,
or
,
at
any
rate
,
a
building
which
,
in
its
external
dimensions
,
is
ecclesiastical
,
having
a
garden
and
architectural
proportions
;
and
a
façade
towards
Holborn
,
somewhat
dingy
,
but
respectable
,
with
an
old
gateway
,
and
with
a
decided
character
of
its
own
.
  
<EOS>
The
building
in
which
Mr.
John
Vavasor
had
a
room
and
a
desk
was
located
in
one
of
these
side
streets
,
and
had
,
in
its
infantine
days
,
been
regarded
with
complacency
by
its
founder
.
<EOS>
It
was
stone
-
faced
,
and
strong
,
and
though
very
ugly
,
had
about
it
that
air
of
importance
which
justifies
a
building
in
assuming
a
special
name
of
itself
.
<EOS>
This
building
was
called
the
Accountant
-
General
's
Record
Office
,
and
very
probably
,
in
the
gloom
of
its
dark
cellars
,
may
lie
to
this
day
the
records
of
the
expenditure
of
many
a
fair
property
which
has
gotten
itself
into
Chancery
,
and
has
never
gotten
itself
out
again
.
<EOS>
It
was
entered
by
a
dark
hall
,
the
door
of
which
was
never
closed
;
and
which
,
having
another
door
at
its
further
end
leading
into
another
lane
,
had
become
itself
a
thoroughfare
.
<EOS>
But
the
passers
through
it
were
few
in
number
.
<EOS>
Now
and
then
a
boy
might
be
seen
there
carrying
on
his
head
or
shoulders
a
huge
mass
of
papers
which
you
would
presume
to
be
accounts
,
or
some
clerk
employed
in
the
purlieus
of
Chancery
Lane
who
would
know
the
shortest
possible
way
from
the
chambers
of
some
one
attorney
to
those
of
some
other
.
<EOS>
But
this
hall
,
though
open
at
both
ends
,
was
as
dark
as
Erebus
;
and
any
who
lingered
in
it
would
soon
find
themselves
to
be
growing
damp
,
and
would
smell
mildew
,
and
would
become
naturally
affected
by
the
exhalations
arising
from
those
Chancery
records
beneath
their
feet
.
  
<EOS>
Up
the
stone
stairs
,
from
this
hall
,
John
Grey
passed
to
Mr.
Vavasor
's
signing
-
room
.
<EOS>
The
stairs
were
broad
,
and
almost
of
noble
proportions
,
but
the
darkness
and
gloom
which
hung
about
the
hall
,
hung
also
about
them
,
 
a
melancholy
set
of
stairs
,
up
and
down
which
no
man
can
walk
with
cheerful
feet
.
<EOS>
Here
he
came
upon
a
long
,
broad
passage
,
in
which
no
sound
was
,
at
first
,
to
be
heard
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
busy
noise
of
doors
slamming
,
no
rapid
sound
of
shoes
,
no
passing
to
and
fro
of
men
intent
on
their
daily
bread
.
<EOS>
Pausing
for
a
moment
,
that
he
might
look
round
about
him
and
realize
the
deathlike
stillness
of
the
whole
,
John
Grey
could
just
distinguish
the
heavy
breathing
of
a
man
,
thereby
learning
that
there
was
a
captive
in
,
at
any
rate
,
one
of
those
prisons
on
each
side
of
him
.
<EOS>
As
he
drew
near
to
the
door
of
Mr.
Vavasor
's
chamber
he
knew
that
the
breathing
came
from
thence
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
door
there
were
words
inscribed
,
which
were
just
legible
in
the
gloom
 
"
Signing
Room
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
How
John
Vavasor
did
hate
those
words
!
<EOS>
It
seemed
to
him
that
they
had
been
placed
there
with
the
express
object
of
declaring
his
degradation
aloud
to
the
world
.
<EOS>
Since
his
grandfather
's
will
had
been
read
to
him
he
had
almost
made
up
his
mind
to
go
down
those
melancholy
stairs
for
the
last
time
,
to
shake
the
dust
off
his
feet
as
he
left
the
Accountant
-
General
's
Record
Office
for
ever
,
and
content
himself
with
half
his
official
income
.
<EOS>
But
how
could
he
give
up
so
many
hundreds
a
year
while
his
daughter
was
persisting
in
throwing
away
thousands
as
fast
as
,
or
faster
than
<EOS>
,
she
could
lay
her
hands
on
them
?
  
<EOS>
John
Grey
entered
the
room
and
found
Mr.
Vavasor
sitting
all
alone
in
an
arm
-
chair
over
the
fire
.
<EOS>
I
rather
think
that
that
breathing
had
been
the
breathing
of
a
man
asleep
.
<EOS>
He
was
resting
himself
amidst
the
labours
of
his
signing
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
large
,
dull
room
,
which
could
not
have
been
painted
,
I
should
think
,
within
the
memory
of
man
,
looking
out
backwards
into
some
court
.
<EOS>
The
black
wall
of
another
building
seemed
to
stand
up
close
to
the
window
,
 
so
close
that
no
direct
ray
of
the
sun
ever
interrupted
the
signing
-
clerk
at
his
work
.
<EOS>
In
the
middle
of
the
room
there
was
a
large
mahogany
-
table
,
on
which
lay
a
pile
of
huge
papers
.
<EOS>
Across
the
top
of
them
there
was
placed
a
bit
of
blotting
-
paper
,
with
a
quill
pen
,
the
two
only
tools
which
were
necessary
to
the
performance
of
the
signing
-
clerk
's
work
.
<EOS>
On
the
table
there
stood
a
row
of
official
books
,
placed
lengthways
on
their
edges
:
the
"
Post
-
Office
Directory
,
"
the
"
Court
Circular
,
"
a
"
Directory
to
the
Inns
of
Court
,
"
a
dusty
volume
of
Acts
of
Parliament
,
which
had
reference
to
Chancery
accounts
,
 
a
volume
which
Mr.
Vavasor
never
opened
;
and
there
were
some
others
;
but
there
was
no
book
there
in
which
any
Christian
man
or
woman
could
take
delight
,
either
for
amusement
or
for
recreation
.
<EOS>
There
were
<EOS>
three
or
four
chairs
round
the
wall
,
and
there
was
the
one
arm
-
chair
which
the
occupant
of
the
chamber
had
dragged
away
from
its
sacred
place
to
the
hearth
-
rug
.
<EOS>
There
was
also
an
old
Turkey
carpet
on
the
floor
.
<EOS>
Other
furniture
there
was
none
.
<EOS>
Can
it
be
a
matter
of
surprise
to
any
one
that
Mr.
Vavasor
preferred
his
club
to
his
place
of
business
?
<EOS>
He
was
not
left
quite
alone
in
this
deathlike
dungeon
.
<EOS>
Attached
to
his
own
large
room
there
was
a
small
closet
,
in
which
sat
the
signing
-
clerk
's
clerk
,
 
a
lad
of
perhaps
seventeen
years
of
age
,
who
spent
the
greatest
part
of
his
time
playing
tit
-
tat
-
to
by
himself
upon
official
blotting
-
paper
.
<EOS>
Had
I
been
Mr.
Vavasor
<EOS>
I
should
have
sworn
a
bosom
friendship
with
that
lad
,
have
told
him
all
my
secrets
,
and
joined
his
youthful
games
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
in
!
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Vavasor
had
cried
when
John
Grey
disturbed
his
slumber
by
knocking
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
glad
to
see
you
,
 
very
.
<EOS>
Sit
down
;
wo
n't
you
?
<EOS>
Did
you
ever
see
such
a
wretched
fire
?
<EOS>
The
coals
they
give
you
in
this
place
are
the
worst
in
all
London
.
<EOS>
Did
you
ever
see
such
coals
?
"
<EOS>
And
he
gave
a
wicked
poke
at
the
fire
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
now
the
1st
of
May
,
and
Grey
,
who
had
walked
from
Suffolk
Street
,
was
quite
warm
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
One
hardly
wants
a
fire
at
all
,
such
weather
as
this
,
"
he
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
;
do
n't
you
?
"
said
the
signing
-
clerk
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
had
to
sit
here
all
day
,
you
'd
see
if
you
did
n't
want
a
fire
.
<EOS>
It
's
the
coldest
building
I
ever
put
my
foot
in
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
in
winter
I
have
to
sit
here
the
whole
day
in
a
great
-
coat
.
<EOS>
I
only
wish
I
could
shut
old
Sugden
up
here
for
a
week
or
two
,
after
Christmas
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
great
lawyer
whom
he
had
named
was
the
man
whom
he
supposed
to
have
inflicted
on
him
the
terrible
injury
of
his
life
,
and
he
was
continually
invoking
small
misfortunes
on
the
head
of
that
tyrant
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
is
Alice
?
"
said
Grey
,
desiring
to
turn
the
subject
from
the
ten
-
times
-
told
tale
of
his
friend
's
wrongs
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Vavasor
sighed
.
<EOS>
"
She
is
well
enough
,
I
believe
,
"
he
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
anything
the
matter
in
Queen
Anne
Street
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
'll
hardly
believe
it
when
I
tell
you
;
and
,
indeed
,
I
hardly
know
whether
I
ought
to
tell
you
or
not
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
As
you
and
I
have
gone
so
far
together
,
I
think
that
you
ought
to
tell
me
anything
that
concerns
her
nearly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
just
it
.
<EOS>
It
's
about
her
money
.
<EOS>
Do
you
know
,
Grey
,
I
'm
beginning
to
think
that
I
've
been
wrong
in
allowing
you
to
advance
what
you
have
done
on
her
account
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
wrong
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Because
I
foresee
there
'll
be
a
difficulty
about
it
.
<EOS>
How
are
we
to
manage
about
the
repayment
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
she
becomes
my
wife
there
will
be
no
management
wanted
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
how
if
she
never
becomes
your
wife
?
<EOS>
I
'm
beginning
to
think
she
'll
never
do
anything
like
any
other
woman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
not
quite
sure
that
you
understand
her
,
"
said
Grey
;
"
though
of
course
you
ought
to
do
so
better
than
any
one
else
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nobody
can
understand
her
,
"
said
the
angry
father
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
told
me
the
other
day
,
as
you
know
,
that
she
was
going
to
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
her
cousin
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
Has
she
 
<EOS>
has
she
become
friends
with
him
again
?
"
said
Grey
.
<EOS>
As
he
asked
the
question
there
came
a
red
spot
on
each
cheek
,
showing
the
strong
mental
anxiety
which
had
prompted
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
I
believe
not
;
 
that
is
,
certainly
not
in
the
way
you
mean
.
<EOS>
I
think
that
she
is
beginning
to
know
that
he
is
a
rascal
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
great
blessing
that
she
has
learned
the
truth
before
it
was
too
late
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
would
you
believe
it
;
 
she
has
given
him
her
name
to
bills
for
two
thousand
pounds
,
payable
at
two
weeks
"
sight
?
<EOS>
He
sent
to
her
only
this
morning
a
fellow
that
he
called
his
clerk
,
and
she
has
been
fool
enough
to
accept
them
.
<EOS>
Two
thousand
pounds
!
<EOS>
That
comes
of
leaving
money
at
a
young
woman
's
own
disposal
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
But
we
expected
that
,
you
know
,
"
said
Grey
,
who
seemed
to
take
the
news
with
much
composure
.
  
<EOS>
"
Expected
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
we
did
.
<EOS>
You
yourself
did
not
suppose
that
what
he
had
before
would
have
been
the
last
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
after
she
had
quarrelled
with
him
!
"
  
"
That
would
make
no
difference
with
her
.
<EOS>
She
had
promised
him
her
money
,
and
as
it
seems
that
he
will
be
content
with
that
,
let
her
keep
her
promise
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
give
him
everything
!
<EOS>
Not
if
I
can
help
it
.
<EOS>
I
'll
expose
him
.
<EOS>
I
will
indeed
.
<EOS>
Such
a
pitiful
rascal
as
he
is
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
do
nothing
,
Mr.
Vavasor
,
that
will
injure
your
daughter
.
<EOS>
I
'm
very
sure
of
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
But
,
by
heavens
 
.
<EOS>
Such
sheer
robbery
as
that
!
<EOS>
Two
thousand
pounds
more
in
fourteen
days
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
shortness
of
the
date
at
which
the
bills
were
drawn
seemed
to
afflict
Mr.
Vavasor
almost
as
keenly
as
the
amount
.
<EOS>
Then
he
described
the
whole
transaction
as
accurately
as
he
could
do
so
,
and
also
told
how
Alice
had
declared
her
purpose
of
going
to
Mr.
Round
the
lawyer
,
if
her
father
would
not
undertake
to
procure
the
money
for
her
by
the
time
the
bills
should
become
due
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Round
,
you
know
,
has
heard
nothing
about
it
,
"
he
continued
.
<EOS>
"
He
does
n't
dream
of
any
such
thing
.
<EOS>
If
she
would
take
my
advice
,
she
would
leave
the
bills
,
and
let
them
be
dishonoured
.
<EOS>
As
it
is
,
I
think
I
shall
call
at
Drummonds
"
,
and
explain
the
whole
transaction
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
not
do
that
,
"
said
Grey
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
call
at
Drummonds
"
,
instead
,
and
see
that
the
money
is
all
right
for
the
bills
.
<EOS>
As
far
as
they
go
,
let
him
have
his
plunder
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
if
she
wo
n't
take
you
,
at
last
,
Grey
?
<EOS>
Upon
my
word
,
I
do
n't
think
she
ever
will
.
<EOS>
My
belief
is
she
'll
never
get
married
.
<EOS>
She
'll
never
do
anything
like
any
other
woman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
money
wo
n't
be
missed
by
me
if
I
never
get
married
,
"
said
Grey
,
with
a
smile
.
<EOS>
"
If
she
does
marry
me
,
of
course
I
shall
make
her
pay
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
by
George
!
<EOS>
that
wo
n't
do
,
"
said
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
"
If
she
were
your
daughter
you
'd
know
that
she
could
not
take
a
man
's
money
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
know
it
now
,
though
she
is
not
my
daughter
.
<EOS>
I
was
only
joking
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
I
am
certain
,
 
finally
certain
,
 
that
she
can
never
become
my
wife
,
I
will
take
back
my
money
.
<EOS>
You
need
not
be
afraid
.
<EOS>
The
nature
of
the
arrangement
we
have
made
shall
then
be
explained
to
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
In
this
way
it
was
settled
;
and
on
the
following
morning
the
father
informed
the
daughter
that
he
had
done
her
bidding
,
and
that
the
money
would
be
placed
to
her
credit
at
the
bankers
"
before
the
bills
came
due
.
<EOS>
On
that
Saturday
,
the
day
which
her
cousin
had
named
in
his
letter
,
she
trudged
down
to
Drummonds
"
,
and
was
informed
by
a
very
courteous
senior
clerk
in
that
establishment
,
that
due
preparation
for
the
bills
had
been
made
.
  
<EOS>
So
far
,
I
think
we
may
say
that
Mr.
George
Vavasor
was
not
unfortunate
.
   
<EOS>
Going
Abroad
.
 
<EOS>
One
morning
,
early
in
May
,
a
full
week
before
Alice
's
visit
to
the
bankers
"
at
Charing
Cross
,
a
servant
in
grand
livery
,
six
feet
high
,
got
out
of
a
cab
at
the
door
in
Queen
Anne
Street
,
and
sent
up
a
note
for
Miss
Vavasor
,
declaring
that
he
would
wait
in
the
cab
for
her
answer
.
<EOS>
He
had
come
from
Lady
Glencora
,
and
had
been
specially
ordered
to
go
in
a
cab
and
come
back
in
a
cab
,
and
make
himself
as
like
a
Mercury
,
with
wings
to
his
feet
,
as
may
be
possible
to
a
London
footman
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
had
arranged
his
plans
with
his
wife
that
morning
,
 
or
,
I
should
more
correctly
say
,
had
given
her
his
orders
,
and
she
,
in
consequence
,
had
sent
away
her
Mercury
in
hot
pressing
haste
to
Queen
Anne
Street
.
<EOS>
"
Do
come
;
 
instantly
if
you
can
,
"
the
note
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
so
much
to
tell
you
,
and
so
much
to
ask
of
you
.
<EOS>
If
you
ca
n't
come
,
when
shall
I
find
you
,
and
where
?
"
<EOS>
Alice
sent
back
a
note
,
saying
that
she
would
be
in
Park
Lane
as
soon
as
she
could
put
on
her
bonnet
and
walk
down
;
and
then
the
Mercury
went
home
in
his
cab
.
  
<EOS>
Alice
found
her
friend
in
the
small
breakfast
-
room
up
-
stairs
,
sitting
close
by
the
window
.
<EOS>
They
had
not
as
yet
met
since
the
evening
of
Lady
Monk
's
party
,
nor
had
Lady
Glencora
seen
Alice
in
the
mourning
which
she
now
wore
for
her
grandfather
.
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
dear
,
what
a
change
it
makes
in
you
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
never
thought
of
your
being
in
black
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
what
it
is
you
want
,
but
sha
n't
I
do
in
mourning
as
well
as
I
would
in
colours
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
'll
do
in
anything
,
dear
.
<EOS>
But
I
have
so
much
to
tell
you
,
and
I
do
n't
know
how
to
begin
.
<EOS>
And
I
've
so
much
to
ask
of
you
,
and
I
'm
so
afraid
you
wo
n't
do
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
generally
find
me
very
complaisant
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
I
do
n't
,
dear
.
<EOS>
It
is
very
seldom
you
will
do
anything
for
me
.
<EOS>
But
I
must
tell
you
everything
first
.
<EOS>
Do
take
your
bonnet
off
,
for
I
shall
be
hours
in
doing
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Hours
in
telling
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
and
in
getting
your
consent
to
what
I
want
you
to
do
.
<EOS>
But
I
think
I
'll
tell
you
that
first
.
<EOS>
I
'm
to
be
taken
abroad
immediately
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Who
is
to
take
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
you
may
well
ask
that
.
<EOS>
If
you
could
know
what
questions
I
have
asked
myself
on
that
head
!
<EOS>
I
sometimes
say
things
to
myself
as
though
they
were
the
most
proper
and
reasonable
things
in
the
world
,
and
then
within
an
hour
or
two
I
hate
myself
for
having
thought
of
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
why
do
n't
you
answer
me
?
<EOS>
Who
is
going
abroad
with
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
;
you
are
to
be
one
of
the
party
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
you
.
<EOS>
When
I
have
named
so
very
respectable
a
chaperon
for
my
youth
,
of
course
you
will
understand
that
my
husband
is
to
take
us
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
Mr.
Palliser
ca
n't
leave
London
at
this
time
of
the
year
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
just
it
.
<EOS>
He
is
to
leave
London
at
this
time
of
the
year
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
look
in
that
way
,
for
it
's
all
settled
.
<EOS>
Whether
you
go
with
me
or
not
,
I
've
got
to
go
.
<EOS>
To
-
day
is
Tuesday
.
<EOS>
We
are
to
be
off
next
Tuesday
night
,
if
you
can
make
yourself
ready
.
<EOS>
We
shall
breakfast
in
Paris
on
Wednesday
morning
,
and
then
it
will
be
to
us
all
just
as
if
we
were
in
a
new
world
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
will
walk
up
and
down
the
new
court
of
the
Louvre
,
and
you
will
be
on
his
left
arm
,
and
I
shall
be
on
his
right
,
 
just
like
English
people
,
 
and
it
will
be
the
most
proper
thing
that
ever
was
seen
in
life
.
<EOS>
Then
we
shall
go
on
to
Basle
<EOS>
"
 
Alice
shuddered
as
Basle
was
mentioned
,
thinking
of
the
balcony
over
the
river
 
"
and
so
to
Lucerne
 
.
<EOS>
But
no
;
that
was
the
first
plan
,
and
Mr.
Palliser
altered
it
.
<EOS>
He
spent
a
whole
day
up
here
with
maps
and
Bradshaw
's
and
Murray
's
guide
-
books
,
and
he
scolded
me
so
because
I
did
n't
care
whether
we
went
first
to
Baden
or
to
some
other
place
.
<EOS>
How
could
I
care
?
<EOS>
I
told
him
I
would
go
anywhere
<EOS>
he
chose
to
take
me
.
<EOS>
Then
he
told
me
I
was
heartless
;
 
and
I
acknowledged
that
I
was
heartless
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
heartless
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
Tell
me
something
I
do
n't
know
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Cora
,
why
did
you
say
that
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
choose
to
contradict
my
husband
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
it
's
true
.
<EOS>
Then
he
threw
the
Bradshaw
away
,
and
all
the
maps
flew
about
.
<EOS>
So
I
picked
them
up
again
,
and
said
we
'd
go
to
Switzerland
first
.
<EOS>
I
knew
that
would
settle
it
,
and
of
course
he
decided
on
stopping
at
Baden
.
<EOS>
If
he
had
said
Jericho
,
it
would
have
been
the
same
thing
to
me
.
<EOS>
Would
n't
you
like
to
go
to
Jericho
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
have
no
special
objection
to
Jericho
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
are
to
go
to
Baden
instead
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
've
said
nothing
about
that
yet
.
<EOS>
But
you
have
not
told
me
half
your
story
.
<EOS>
Why
is
Mr.
Palliser
going
abroad
in
the
middle
of
Parliament
in
this
way
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
;
now
I
must
go
back
to
the
beginning
.
<EOS>
And
indeed
,
Alice
,
I
hardly
know
how
to
tell
you
;
not
that
I
mind
you
knowing
it
,
only
there
are
some
things
that
wo
n't
get
themselves
told
.
<EOS>
You
can
hardly
guess
what
it
is
that
he
is
giving
up
.
<EOS>
You
must
swear
that
you
wo
n't
repeat
what
I
'm
going
to
tell
you
now
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
not
a
person
apt
to
tell
secrets
,
but
I
sha
n't
swear
anything
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
a
woman
you
are
for
discretion
!
<EOS>
it
is
you
that
ought
to
be
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
;
you
are
so
wise
.
<EOS>
Only
you
have
n't
brought
your
own
pigs
to
the
best
market
,
after
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Never
mind
my
own
pigs
now
,
Cora
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
mind
them
,
very
much
.
<EOS>
But
the
secret
is
this
.
<EOS>
They
have
asked
Mr.
Palliser
to
be
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
,
and
he
has
 
refused
.
<EOS>
Think
of
that
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
why
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Because
of
me
,
 
of
me
,
and
my
folly
,
and
wickedness
,
and
abominations
.
<EOS>
Because
he
has
been
fool
enough
to
plague
himself
with
a
wife
 
he
who
of
all
men
ought
to
have
kept
himself
free
from
such
troubles
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
he
has
been
so
good
!
<EOS>
It
is
almost
impossible
to
make
any
one
understand
it
.
<EOS>
If
you
could
know
how
he
has
longed
for
this
office
;
 
how
he
has
worked
for
it
day
and
night
,
wearing
his
eyes
out
with
figures
when
everybody
else
has
been
asleep
,
shutting
himself
up
with
such
creatures
as
Mr.
Bott
when
other
men
have
been
shooting
and
hunting
and
flirting
and
spending
their
money
.
<EOS>
He
has
been
a
slave
to
it
for
years
,
 
all
his
life
I
believe
,
 
in
order
that
he
might
sit
in
the
Cabinet
,
and
be
a
minister
and
a
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
.
<EOS>
He
has
hoped
and
feared
,
and
has
been
,
I
believe
,
sometimes
half
-
mad
with
expectation
.
<EOS>
This
has
been
his
excitement
,
 
what
racing
and
gambling
are
to
other
men
.
<EOS>
At
last
,
the
place
was
there
,
ready
for
him
,
and
they
offered
it
to
him
.
<EOS>
They
begged
him
to
take
it
,
almost
on
their
knees
.
<EOS>
The
Duke
of
St.
Bungay
was
here
all
one
morning
about
it
;
but
Mr.
Palliser
sent
him
away
,
and
refused
the
place
.
<EOS>
It
's
all
over
now
,
and
the
other
man
,
whom
they
all
hate
so
much
,
is
to
remain
in
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
why
did
he
refuse
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
keep
on
telling
you
 
because
of
me
.
<EOS>
He
found
that
I
wanted
looking
after
,
and
that
Mrs.
Marsham
and
Mr.
Bott
between
them
could
n't
do
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Cora
!
<EOS>
how
can
you
talk
in
that
way
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
knew
all
,
you
might
well
ask
how
I
could
.
<EOS>
You
remember
about
Lady
Monk
's
ball
,
that
you
would
not
go
to
,
 
as
you
ought
to
have
done
.
<EOS>
If
you
had
gone
,
Mr.
Palliser
would
have
been
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
at
this
minute
;
he
would
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
Only
think
of
that
!
<EOS>
But
though
you
did
not
go
,
other
people
did
who
ought
to
have
remained
at
home
.
<EOS>
I
went
for
one
,
 
<EOS>
and
you
know
who
was
there
for
another
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
difference
could
that
make
to
you
?
"
said
Alice
,
angrily
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
might
have
made
a
great
deal
of
difference
.
<EOS>
And
,
for
the
matter
of
that
,
so
it
did
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
was
there
too
,
but
,
of
course
,
he
went
away
immediately
.
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
tell
you
all
the
trouble
there
had
been
about
Mrs.
Marsham
,
 
whether
I
was
to
take
her
with
me
or
not
.
<EOS>
However
,
I
would
n't
take
her
,
and
did
n't
take
her
.
<EOS>
The
carriage
went
for
her
first
,
and
there
she
was
when
we
got
there
;
and
Mr.
Bott
was
there
too
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
whether
I
shall
ever
make
you
understand
it
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
are
some
things
I
do
n't
want
to
understand
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
they
both
were
watching
me
,
 
looking
at
me
the
whole
evening
;
and
,
of
course
,
I
resolved
that
I
would
not
be
put
down
by
them
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
if
I
had
been
you
,
I
would
not
have
allowed
their
presence
to
make
any
difference
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
very
easily
said
,
my
dear
,
but
by
no
means
so
easily
done
.
<EOS>
You
ca
n't
make
yourself
unconscious
of
eyes
that
are
always
looking
at
you
.
<EOS>
I
dared
them
,
at
any
rate
,
to
do
their
worst
,
for
I
stood
up
to
dance
with
Burgo
Fitzgerald
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Cora
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
should
n't
I
?
<EOS>
At
any
rate
I
did
;
and
I
waltzed
with
him
for
half
an
hour
.
<EOS>
Alice
,
I
never
will
waltz
again
;
 
never
.
<EOS>
I
have
done
with
dancing
now
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
think
,
even
in
my
maddest
days
,
I
ever
kept
it
up
so
long
as
I
did
then
.
<EOS>
And
I
knew
that
everybody
was
looking
at
me
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
only
Mrs.
Marsham
and
Mr.
Bott
,
but
everybody
there
.
<EOS>
I
felt
myself
to
be
desperate
,
 
<EOS>
mad
,
like
a
wild
woman
.
<EOS>
There
I
was
,
going
round
and
round
and
round
with
the
only
man
for
whom
I
ever
cared
two
straws
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
as
though
everything
had
been
a
dream
since
the
old
days
.
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
how
well
I
remember
the
first
time
I
danced
with
him
,
 
at
his
aunt
's
house
in
Cavendish
Square
.
<EOS>
They
had
only
just
brought
me
out
in
London
then
,
and
I
thought
that
he
was
a
god
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Cora
!
<EOS>
I
can
not
bear
to
hear
you
talk
like
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
well
enough
that
he
is
no
god
now
;
some
people
say
that
he
is
a
devil
,
but
he
was
like
Apollo
to
me
then
.
<EOS>
Did
you
ever
see
anyone
so
beautiful
as
he
is
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
saw
him
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
you
could
have
seen
him
;
but
you
will
some
day
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
whether
you
care
for
men
being
handsome
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Alice
thought
of
John
Grey
,
who
was
the
handsomest
man
that
she
knew
,
but
she
made
no
answer
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
;
or
,
rather
,
I
used
to
do
,
"
continued
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
I
care
much
about
anything
now
;
but
I
do
n't
see
why
handsome
men
should
not
be
run
after
as
much
as
handsome
women
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
would
n't
have
a
girl
run
after
any
man
,
<EOS>
would
you
;
whether
handsome
or
ugly
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
they
do
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
When
I
saw
him
the
other
night
he
was
just
as
handsome
as
ever
;
 
the
same
look
,
half
wild
and
half
tame
,
like
an
animal
you
can
not
catch
,
but
which
you
think
would
love
you
so
if
you
could
catch
him
.
<EOS>
In
a
little
while
it
was
just
like
the
old
time
,
and
I
had
made
up
my
mind
to
care
nothing
for
the
people
looking
at
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
think
that
was
right
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
do
n't
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
I
do
;
that
is
.
<EOS>
It
was
n't
right
to
care
about
dancing
with
him
,
but
it
was
right
to
disregard
all
the
people
gaping
round
.
<EOS>
What
was
it
to
them
?
<EOS>
Why
should
they
care
who
I
danced
with
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
nonsense
,
dear
,
and
you
must
know
that
it
is
so
.
<EOS>
If
you
were
to
see
a
woman
misbehaving
herself
in
public
,
would
not
you
look
on
and
make
your
comments
?
<EOS>
Could
you
help
doing
so
if
you
were
to
try
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
very
severe
,
Alice
.
<EOS>
Misbehaving
in
public
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Cora
.
<EOS>
I
am
only
taking
your
own
story
.
<EOS>
According
to
that
,
you
were
misbehaving
in
public
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
got
up
from
her
chair
near
the
window
,
on
which
she
had
been
crouching
close
to
Alice
's
knees
,
and
walked
away
towards
the
fireplace
.
<EOS>
"
What
am
I
to
say
to
you
,
or
how
am
I
to
talk
to
you
?
"
said
Alice
.
<EOS>
"
You
would
not
have
me
tell
you
a
lie
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
all
things
in
the
world
,
I
hate
a
prude
the
most
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
.
  
<EOS>
"
Cora
,
look
here
.
<EOS>
If
you
consider
it
prudery
on
my
part
to
disapprove
of
your
waltzing
with
Mr.
Fitzgerald
in
the
manner
you
have
described
,
 
or
,
indeed
,
in
any
other
manner
,
 
you
and
I
must
differ
so
totally
about
the
meaning
of
words
and
the
nature
of
things
that
we
had
better
part
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Alice
,
you
are
the
unkindest
creature
that
ever
lived
.
<EOS>
You
are
as
cold
as
stone
.
<EOS>
I
sometimes
think
that
you
can
have
no
heart
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
mind
your
saying
that
.
<EOS>
Whether
I
have
a
heart
or
not
I
will
leave
you
to
find
out
for
yourself
;
but
I
wo
n't
be
called
a
prude
by
you
.
<EOS>
You
know
you
were
wrong
to
dance
with
that
man
.
<EOS>
What
has
come
of
it
?
<EOS>
What
have
you
told
me
yourself
this
morning
?
<EOS>
In
order
to
preserve
you
from
misery
and
destruction
,
Mr.
Palliser
has
given
up
all
his
dearest
hopes
.
<EOS>
He
has
had
to
sacrifice
himself
that
he
might
save
you
.
<EOS>
That
,
I
take
it
,
is
about
the
truth
of
it
,
 
and
yet
you
tell
me
that
you
have
done
no
wrong
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
said
so
.
<EOS>
"
Now
she
had
come
back
to
her
chair
by
the
window
,
and
was
again
sitting
in
that
crouching
form
.
<EOS>
"
I
never
said
that
I
was
not
wrong
.
<EOS>
Of
course
I
was
wrong
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
so
wrong
throughout
that
I
have
never
been
right
yet
.
<EOS>
Let
me
tell
it
on
to
the
end
,
and
then
you
can
go
away
if
you
like
,
and
tell
me
that
I
am
too
wicked
for
your
friendship
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Have
I
ever
said
anything
like
that
,
Cora
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
But
you
will
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
,
when
I
have
done
.
<EOS>
Well
;
what
do
you
think
my
senior
duenna
did
,
 
<EOS>
the
female
one
,
I
mean
?
<EOS>
She
took
my
own
carriage
,
and
posted
off
after
Mr.
Palliser
as
hard
as
ever
she
could
,
leaving
the
male
duenna
on
the
watch
.
<EOS>
I
was
dancing
as
hard
as
I
could
,
but
I
knew
what
was
going
on
all
the
time
as
well
as
though
I
had
heard
them
talking
.
<EOS>
Of
course
Mr.
Palliser
came
after
me
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
what
else
he
could
do
,
unless
,
indeed
,
he
had
left
me
to
my
fate
.
<EOS>
He
came
there
,
and
behaved
so
well
,
 
so
much
like
a
perfect
gentleman
.
<EOS>
Of
course
I
went
home
,
and
I
was
prepared
to
tell
him
everything
,
if
he
spoke
a
word
to
me
,
 
that
I
intended
to
leave
him
,
and
that
cart
-
ropes
should
not
hold
me
!
<EOS>
"
  
"
To
leave
him
,
Cora
!
"
  
"
Yes
,
and
go
with
that
other
man
whose
name
you
wo
n't
let
me
mention
.
<EOS>
I
had
a
letter
from
him
in
my
pocket
asking
me
to
go
.
<EOS>
He
asked
me
a
dozen
times
that
night
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
think
how
it
was
that
I
did
not
consent
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
you
did
not
consent
to
your
own
ruin
and
disgrace
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
I
did
not
consent
to
go
off
with
him
,
 
anywhere
.
<EOS>
Of
course
it
would
have
been
my
own
destruction
.
<EOS>
I
'm
not
such
a
fool
as
not
to
know
that
.
<EOS>
Do
you
suppose
I
have
never
thought
of
it
;
 
what
it
would
be
to
be
a
man
's
mistress
instead
of
his
wife
.
<EOS>
If
I
had
not
I
should
be
a
thing
to
be
hated
and
despised
.
<EOS>
When
once
I
had
done
it
I
should
hate
and
despise
myself
.
<EOS>
I
should
feel
myself
to
be
loathsome
,
and
,
as
it
were
,
a
beast
among
women
.
<EOS>
But
why
did
they
not
let
me
marry
him
,
instead
of
driving
me
to
this
?
<EOS>
And
though
I
might
have
destroyed
myself
,
I
should
have
saved
the
man
who
is
still
my
husband
.
<EOS>
Do
you
know
,
I
told
him
all
that
,
 
told
him
that
if
I
had
gone
away
with
Burgo
Fitzgerald
he
would
have
another
wife
,
and
would
have
children
,
and
would
 
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
told
your
husband
that
you
had
thought
of
leaving
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
I
told
him
everything
.
<EOS>
I
told
him
that
I
dearly
loved
that
poor
fellow
,
for
whom
,
as
I
believe
,
nobody
else
on
earth
cares
a
single
straw
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
did
he
say
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
tell
you
what
he
said
,
only
that
we
are
all
to
go
to
Baden
together
,
and
then
to
Italy
.
<EOS>
But
he
did
not
seem
a
bit
angry
;
he
very
seldom
is
angry
,
unless
at
some
trumpery
thing
,
as
when
he
threw
the
book
away
.
<EOS>
And
when
I
told
him
that
he
might
have
another
wife
and
a
child
,
he
put
his
arm
round
me
and
whispered
to
me
that
he
did
not
care
so
much
about
it
as
I
had
imagined
.
<EOS>
I
felt
more
like
loving
him
at
that
moment
than
I
had
ever
done
before
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
must
be
fit
to
be
an
angel
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
's
fit
to
be
a
cabinet
minister
,
<EOS>
which
,
I
'm
quite
sure
,
he
'd
like
much
better
.
<EOS>
And
now
you
know
everything
;
but
no
,
 
there
is
one
thing
you
do
n't
know
yet
.
<EOS>
When
I
tell
you
that
,
you
'll
want
to
make
him
an
archangel
or
a
prime
minister
.
<EOS>
"
We
'll
go
abroad
,
"
he
said
,
 
and
remember
,
this
was
his
own
proposition
,
made
long
before
I
was
able
to
speak
a
word
;
 
"
We
'll
go
abroad
,
and
you
shall
get
your
cousin
Alice
to
go
with
us
.
"
<EOS>
That
touched
me
more
than
anything
.
<EOS>
Only
think
if
he
had
proposed
Mrs.
Marsham
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
yet
he
does
not
like
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
're
wrong
there
,
Alice
.
<EOS>
There
has
been
no
question
of
liking
or
of
disliking
.
<EOS>
He
thought
you
would
be
a
kind
of
Mrs.
Marsham
,
and
when
you
were
not
,
but
went
out
flirting
among
the
ruins
with
Jeffrey
Palliser
,
instead
 
"
  
"
I
never
went
out
flirting
with
Jeffrey
Palliser
.
"
  
"
He
did
with
you
,
which
is
all
the
same
thing
.
<EOS>
And
when
Plantagenet
knew
of
that
,
 
for
,
of
course
,
Mr.
Bott
told
him
 
"
  
"
Mr.
Bott
ca
n't
see
everything
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Those
men
do
.
<EOS>
The
worst
is
,
they
see
more
than
everything
.
<EOS>
But
,
at
any
rate
,
Mr.
Palliser
has
got
over
all
that
now
.
<EOS>
Come
,
Alice
;
the
fact
of
the
offer
having
come
from
himself
should
disarm
you
of
any
such
objection
as
that
.
<EOS>
As
he
has
held
out
his
hand
to
you
,
you
have
no
alternative
but
to
take
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
take
his
hand
willingly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
for
my
sake
you
will
go
with
us
?
<EOS>
He
understands
himself
that
I
am
not
fit
to
be
his
companion
,
and
to
have
no
companion
but
him
.
<EOS>
Now
there
is
a
spirit
of
wisdom
about
you
that
will
do
for
him
,
and
a
spirit
of
folly
that
will
suit
me
.
<EOS>
I
can
manage
to
put
myself
on
a
par
with
a
girl
who
has
played
such
a
wild
game
with
her
lovers
as
you
have
done
.
"
  
<EOS>
Alice
would
give
no
promise
then
.
<EOS>
Her
first
objection
was
that
she
had
undertaken
to
go
down
to
Westmoreland
and
comfort
Kate
in
the
affliction
of
her
broken
arm
.
"
<EOS>
And
I
must
go
,
"
said
Alice
,
remembering
how
necessary
it
was
that
she
should
plead
her
own
cause
with
George
Vavasor
's
sister
.
<EOS>
But
she
acknowledged
that
she
had
not
intended
to
stay
long
in
Westmoreland
,
probably
not
more
than
a
week
,
and
it
was
at
last
decided
that
the
Pallisers
should
postpone
their
journey
for
four
or
five
days
,
and
that
Alice
should
go
with
them
immediately
upon
her
return
from
Vavasor
Hall
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
objection
;
"
said
her
father
,
speaking
with
that
voice
of
resignation
which
men
use
when
they
are
resolved
to
consider
themselves
injured
whatever
may
be
done
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
get
along
in
lodgings
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
we
had
better
leave
the
house
,
as
you
have
given
away
so
much
of
your
own
fortune
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Alice
did
not
think
it
worth
her
while
to
point
out
to
him
,
in
answer
to
this
,
that
her
contribution
to
their
joint
housekeeping
should
still
remain
the
same
as
ever
.
<EOS>
Such
,
however
,
she
knew
would
be
the
fact
,
and
she
knew
also
that
she
would
find
her
father
in
the
old
house
when
she
returned
from
her
travels
.
<EOS>
To
her
,
in
her
own
great
troubles
,
the
absence
from
London
would
be
as
serviceable
as
it
could
be
to
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
she
had
already
begun
to
feel
the
impossibility
of
staying
quietly
at
home
.
<EOS>
She
could
lecture
her
cousin
,
whose
faults
were
open
,
easy
to
be
defined
,
and
almost
loud
in
their
nature
;
but
she
was
not
on
that
account
the
less
aware
of
her
own
.
<EOS>
She
knew
that
she
too
had
cause
to
be
ashamed
of
herself
.
<EOS>
She
was
half
afraid
to
show
her
face
among
her
friends
,
and
wept
grievously
over
her
own
follies
.
<EOS>
Those
cruel
words
of
her
father
rang
in
her
ears
constantly
:
 
"
Things
of
that
sort
are
so
often
over
with
you
.
"
<EOS>
The
reproach
,
though
cruel
,
was
true
,
and
what
reproach
more
galling
could
be
uttered
to
an
unmarried
girl
such
as
was
Alice
Vavasor
?
<EOS>
She
had
felt
from
the
first
moment
in
which
the
proposition
was
made
to
her
,
that
it
would
be
well
that
she
should
for
a
while
leave
her
home
,
and
especially
that
drawing
-
room
in
Queen
Anne
Street
,
which
told
her
so
many
tales
that
she
would
fain
forget
,
if
it
were
possible
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
would
not
allow
his
wife
to
remain
in
London
for
the
ten
or
twelve
days
which
must
yet
elapse
before
they
started
,
nor
could
he
send
her
into
the
country
alone
.
<EOS>
He
took
her
down
to
Matching
Priory
,
having
obtained
leave
to
be
absent
from
the
House
for
the
remainder
of
the
Session
,
and
remained
with
her
there
till
within
two
days
of
their
departure
.
<EOS>
That
week
down
at
Matching
,
as
she
afterwards
told
Alice
,
was
very
terrible
.
<EOS>
He
never
spoke
a
word
to
rebuke
her
.
<EOS>
He
never
hinted
that
there
had
been
aught
in
her
conduct
of
which
he
had
cause
to
complain
.
<EOS>
He
treated
her
with
a
respect
that
was
perfect
,
and
indeed
with
more
outward
signs
of
affection
than
had
ever
been
customary
with
him
.
"
<EOS>
But
,
"
as
Lady
Glencora
afterwards
expressed
it
,
"
he
was
always
looking
after
me
.
<EOS>
I
believe
he
thought
that
Burgo
Fitzgerald
had
hidden
himself
among
the
ruins
,
"
she
said
once
to
Alice
.
"
<EOS>
He
never
suspected
me
,
I
am
sure
of
that
;
but
he
thought
that
he
ought
to
look
after
me
.
"
<EOS>
And
Lady
Glencora
in
this
had
very
nearly
hit
the
truth
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
had
resolved
,
from
that
hour
in
which
he
had
walked
out
among
the
elms
in
Kensington
Gardens
,
that
he
would
neither
suspect
his
wife
,
nor
treat
her
as
though
he
suspected
her
.
<EOS>
The
blame
had
been
his
,
perhaps
,
more
than
it
had
been
hers
.
<EOS>
So
much
he
had
acknowledged
to
himself
,
thinking
of
the
confession
she
had
made
to
him
before
their
marriage
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
manifestly
his
imperative
duty
,
 
his
duty
of
duties
,
 
to
save
her
from
that
pitfall
into
which
,
as
she
herself
had
told
him
,
she
had
been
so
ready
to
fall
.
<EOS>
For
her
sake
and
for
his
this
must
be
done
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
duty
so
imperative
,
that
in
its
performance
he
had
found
himself
forced
to
abandon
his
ambition
.
<EOS>
To
have
his
wife
taken
from
him
would
be
terrible
,
but
the
having
it
said
all
over
the
world
that
such
a
misfortune
had
come
upon
him
would
be
almost
more
terrible
even
than
that
.
  
<EOS>
So
he
went
with
his
wife
hither
and
thither
,
down
at
Matching
,
allowing
himself
to
be
driven
about
behind
Dandy
and
Flirt
.
<EOS>
He
himself
proposed
these
little
excursions
.
<EOS>
They
were
tedious
to
him
,
but
doubly
tedious
to
his
wife
,
who
now
found
it
more
difficult
than
ever
to
talk
to
him
.
<EOS>
She
struggled
to
talk
,
and
he
struggled
to
talk
,
but
the
very
struggles
themselves
made
the
thing
impossible
.
<EOS>
He
sat
with
her
in
the
mornings
,
and
he
sat
with
her
in
the
evenings
;
he
breakfasted
with
her
,
lunched
with
her
,
and
dined
with
her
.
<EOS>
He
went
to
bed
early
,
having
no
figures
which
now
claimed
his
attention
.
<EOS>
And
so
the
week
at
last
wore
itself
away
.
<EOS>
"
I
saw
him
yawning
sometimes
,
"
Lady
Glencora
said
afterwards
,
"
as
though
he
would
fall
in
pieces
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr.
John
Grey
in
Queen
Anne
Street
.
 
<EOS>
Alice
was
resolved
that
she
would
keep
her
promise
to
Kate
,
and
pay
her
visit
to
Westmoreland
before
she
started
with
the
Pallisers
.
<EOS>
Kate
had
written
to
her
three
lines
with
her
left
hand
,
begging
her
to
come
,
and
those
three
lines
had
been
more
eloquent
than
anything
she
could
have
written
had
her
right
arm
been
uninjured
.
<EOS>
Alice
had
learned
something
of
the
truth
as
to
the
accident
from
her
father
;
or
,
rather
,
had
heard
her
father
's
surmises
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
She
had
heard
,
too
,
how
her
cousin
George
had
borne
himself
when
the
will
was
read
,
and
how
he
had
afterwards
disappeared
,
never
showing
himself
again
at
the
hall
.
<EOS>
After
all
that
had
passed
she
felt
that
she
owed
Kate
some
sympathy
.
<EOS>
Sympathy
may
,
no
doubt
,
be
conveyed
by
letter
;
but
there
are
things
on
which
it
is
almost
impossible
for
any
writer
to
express
himself
with
adequate
feeling
;
and
there
are
things
,
too
,
which
can
be
spoken
,
but
which
can
not
be
written
.
<EOS>
Therefore
,
though
the
journey
must
be
a
hurried
one
,
Alice
sent
word
down
to
Westmoreland
that
she
was
to
be
expected
there
in
a
day
or
two
.
<EOS>
On
her
return
she
was
to
go
at
once
to
Park
Lane
,
and
sleep
there
for
the
two
nights
which
would
intervene
before
the
departure
of
the
Pallisers
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
day
before
she
started
for
Westmoreland
her
father
came
to
her
in
the
middle
of
the
day
,
and
told
her
that
John
Grey
was
going
to
dine
with
him
in
Queen
Anne
Street
on
that
evening
.
  
<EOS>
"
To
-
day
,
papa
?
<EOS>
"
she
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
Why
not
?
<EOS>
No
man
is
less
particular
as
to
what
he
eats
than
Grey
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
not
thinking
of
that
,
papa
,
"
she
said
.
  
<EOS>
To
this
Mr.
Vavasor
made
no
reply
,
but
stood
for
some
minutes
looking
out
of
the
window
.
<EOS>
Then
he
prepared
to
leave
the
room
,
getting
himself
first
as
far
as
the
table
,
where
he
lifted
a
book
,
and
then
on
half
-
way
to
the
door
before
Alice
arrested
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
,
papa
,
you
and
Mr.
Grey
had
better
dine
alone
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
by
alone
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
meant
without
me
,
 
as
two
men
generally
like
to
do
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
wanted
that
I
should
have
asked
him
to
dine
at
the
club
,
"
said
Mr.
Vavasor
,
and
then
he
again
attempted
to
go
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
papa
 
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
my
dear
!
<EOS>
If
you
mean
to
say
that
because
of
what
has
passed
you
object
to
meet
Mr.
Grey
<EOS>
,
I
can
only
tell
you
it
's
nonsense
,
 
confounded
nonsense
.
<EOS>
If
he
chooses
to
come
there
can
be
no
reason
why
you
should
n't
receive
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
will
look
as

"
  
"
Look
what
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
As
though
he
were
asked
as
my
guest
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
nonsense
.
<EOS>
I
saw
him
yesterday
,
and
I
asked
him
to
come
.
<EOS>
I
saw
him
again
to
-
day
,
and
he
said
he
would
come
.
<EOS>
He
's
not
such
a
fool
as
to
suppose
after
that
,
that
you
asked
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
not
that
I
asked
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
if
you
run
away
you
'll
only
make
more
of
the
thing
than
it
's
worth
.
<EOS>
Of
course
I
ca
n't
make
you
dine
with
me
if
you
do
n't
like
.
"
  
<EOS>
Alice
did
not
like
it
,
but
,
after
some
consideration
,
she
thought
that
she
might
be
open
to
the
imputation
of
having
made
more
of
the
thing
than
it
was
worth
if
she
ran
away
,
as
her
father
called
it
.
<EOS>
She
was
going
to
leave
the
country
for
some
six
or
eight
months
,
 
perhaps
for
a
longer
time
than
that
,
and
it
might
be
as
well
that
she
should
have
an
opportunity
of
telling
her
plans
to
Mr.
Grey
.
<EOS>
She
could
do
it
,
she
thought
,
in
such
a
way
as
to
make
him
understand
that
her
last
quarrel
with
George
Vavasor
was
not
supposed
to
alter
the
footing
on
which
she
stood
with
him
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
doubt
that
her
father
had
told
everything
to
Mr.
Grey
.
<EOS>
She
knew
well
enough
what
her
father
's
wishes
still
were
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
odd
that
he
should
be
asking
John
Grey
to
his
house
,
though
such
exercises
of
domestic
hospitality
were
very
unusual
with
him
.
<EOS>
But
,
 
so
she
declared
to
herself
,
 
such
little
attempts
on
his
part
would
be
altogether
thrown
away
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
pity
that
he
had
not
yet
learned
to
know
her
better
.
<EOS>
She
would
receive
Mr.
Grey
as
the
mistress
of
her
father
's
house
now
,
for
the
last
time
;
and
then
,
on
her
return
in
the
following
year
,
he
would
be
at
Nethercoats
,
and
the
whole
thing
would
be
over
.
  
<EOS>
She
dressed
herself
very
plainly
,
simply
changing
one
black
frock
for
another
,
and
then
sat
herself
in
her
drawing
-
room
awaiting
the
two
gentlemen
.
<EOS>
It
was
already
past
the
hour
of
dinner
before
her
father
came
up
-
stairs
.
<EOS>
She
knew
that
he
was
in
the
house
,
and
in
her
heart
she
accused
him
of
keeping
out
of
the
way
,
in
order
that
John
Grey
might
be
alone
with
her
.
<EOS>
Whether
or
no
she
were
right
in
her
suspicions
John
Grey
did
not
take
advantage
of
the
opportunity
offered
to
him
.
<EOS>
Her
father
came
up
first
,
and
had
seated
himself
silently
in
his
arm
-
chair
before
the
visitor
was
announced
.
  
<EOS>
As
Mr.
Grey
entered
the
room
Alice
knew
that
she
was
flurried
,
but
still
she
managed
to
carry
herself
with
some
dignity
.
<EOS>
His
bearing
was
perfect
.
<EOS>
But
then
,
as
she
declared
to
herself
afterwards
,
no
possible
position
in
life
would
put
him
beside
himself
.
<EOS>
He
came
up
to
her
with
his
usual
quiet
smile
,
 
a
smile
that
was
genial
even
in
its
quietness
,
and
took
her
hand
.
<EOS>
He
took
it
fairly
and
fully
into
his
;
but
there
was
no
squeezing
,
no
special
pressure
,
no
love
-
making
.
<EOS>
And
when
he
spoke
to
her
he
called
her
Alice
,
as
though
his
doing
so
was
of
all
things
the
most
simply
a
matter
of
course
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
tell
-
tale
hesitation
in
his
voice
.
<EOS>
When
did
he
ever
hesitate
at
anything
?
<EOS>
"
I
hear
you
are
going
abroad
,
"
he
said
,
"
with
your
cousin
,
Lady
Glencora
Palliser
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Alice
;
"
I
am
going
with
them
for
a
long
tour
.
<EOS>
We
shall
not
return
,
I
fancy
,
till
the
end
of
next
winter
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Plans
of
that
sort
are
as
easily
broken
as
they
are
made
,
"
said
her
father
.
<EOS>
"
You
wo
n't
be
your
own
mistress
;
and
I
advise
you
not
to
count
too
surely
upon
getting
further
than
Baden
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
If
Mr.
Palliser
changes
his
mind
of
course
I
shall
come
home
,
"
said
Alice
,
with
a
little
attempt
at
a
smile
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
think
him
a
man
not
prone
to
changes
,
"
said
Grey
.
<EOS>
"
But
all
London
is
talking
about
his
change
of
mind
at
this
moment
.
<EOS>
They
say
at
the
clubs
that
he
might
have
been
in
the
Cabinet
if
he
would
,
but
that
he
has
taken
up
this
idea
of
going
abroad
at
the
moment
when
he
was
wanted
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
his
wife
's
doing
<EOS>
,
I
take
it
,
"
said
Mr.
Vavasor
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
the
worst
of
being
in
Parliament
,
"
said
Grey
.
<EOS>
"
A
man
ca
n't
do
anything
without
giving
a
reason
for
it
.
<EOS>
There
must
be
men
for
public
life
,
of
course
;
but
,
upon
my
word
,
I
think
we
ought
to
be
very
much
obliged
to
them
.
"
  
<EOS>
Alice
,
as
she
took
her
old
lover
's
arm
,
and
walked
down
with
him
to
dinner
,
thought
of
all
her
former
quarrels
with
him
on
this
very
subject
.
<EOS>
On
this
very
point
she
had
left
him
.
<EOS>
He
had
never
argued
the
matter
with
her
.
<EOS>
He
had
never
asked
her
to
argue
with
him
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
condescended
so
far
as
that
.
<EOS>
Had
he
done
so
<EOS>
,
she
thought
that
she
would
have
brought
herself
to
think
as
he
thought
.
<EOS>
She
would
have
striven
,
at
any
rate
,
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
But
she
could
not
become
unambitious
,
tranquil
,
fond
of
retirement
,
and
philosophic
,
without
an
argument
on
the
matter
,
 
without
being
allowed
even
the
poor
grace
of
owning
herself
to
be
convinced
.
<EOS>
If
a
man
takes
a
dog
with
him
from
the
country
up
to
town
,
the
dog
must
live
a
town
life
without
knowing
the
reason
why
;
 
must
live
a
town
life
or
die
a
town
death
.
<EOS>
But
a
woman
should
not
be
treated
like
a
dog
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Had
he
deigned
to
discuss
it
with
me
!
"
<EOS>
Alice
had
so
often
said
.
<EOS>
"
But
,
no
;
he
will
read
his
books
,
and
I
am
to
go
there
to
fetch
him
his
slippers
,
and
make
his
tea
for
him
.
<EOS>
"
All
this
came
upon
her
again
as
she
walked
down
-
stairs
by
his
side
;
and
with
it
there
came
a
consciousness
that
she
had
been
driven
by
this
usage
into
the
terrible
engagement
which
she
had
made
with
her
cousin
.
<EOS>
That
,
no
doubt
,
was
now
over
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
longer
to
her
any
question
of
her
marrying
George
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
But
the
fact
that
she
had
been
mad
enough
to
think
and
talk
of
such
a
marriage
,
had
of
itself
been
enough
to
ruin
her
.
<EOS>
"
Things
of
that
sort
are
so
often
over
with
you
!
"
<EOS>
After
such
a
speech
as
that
to
her
from
her
father
,
Alice
told
herself
that
there
could
be
no
more
"
things
of
that
sort
"
for
her
.
<EOS>
But
all
her
misery
had
been
brought
about
by
this
scornful
superiority
to
the
ordinary
pursuits
of
the
world
,
 
this
looking
down
upon
humanity
.
<EOS>
"
It
seems
to
me
,
"
she
said
,
very
quietly
,
while
her
hand
was
yet
upon
his
arm
,
"
that
your
pity
is
hardly
needed
.
<EOS>
I
should
think
that
no
persons
can
be
happier
than
those
whom
you
call
our
public
men
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
"
said
he
,
"
that
is
our
old
quarrel
.
"
<EOS>
He
said
it
as
though
the
quarrel
had
simply
been
an
argument
between
them
,
or
a
dozen
arguments
,
 
as
arguments
do
come
up
between
friends
;
not
as
though
it
had
served
to
separate
for
life
<EOS>
two
persons
who
had
loved
each
other
dearly
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
the
old
story
of
the
town
mouse
and
the
country
mouse
,
 
as
old
as
the
hills
.
<EOS>
Mice
may
be
civil
for
a
while
,
and
compliment
each
other
;
but
when
they
come
to
speak
their
minds
freely
,
each
likes
his
own
life
best
.
"
<EOS>
She
said
nothing
more
at
the
moment
,
and
the
three
sat
down
to
their
small
dinner
-
table
.
<EOS>
It
was
astonishing
to
Alice
that
he
should
be
able
to
talk
in
this
way
,
to
hint
at
such
things
,
to
allude
to
their
former
hopes
and
present
condition
,
without
a
quiver
in
his
voice
,
or
,
as
far
as
she
could
perceive
,
without
any
feeling
in
his
heart
.
  
<EOS>
"
Alice
,
"
said
her
father
,
"
I
ca
n't
compliment
your
cook
upon
her
soup
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
encourage
her
,
papa
,
by
eating
it
often
enough
.
<EOS>
And
then
you
only
told
me
at
two
o'clock
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
a
cook
ca
n't
make
soup
between
two
and
seven
,
she
ca
n't
make
it
in
a
week
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
Mr.
Grey
will
excuse
it
,
"
said
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
n't
it
good
?
"
said
he
.
<EOS>
"
I
wo
n't
say
that
it
is
,
because
I
should
be
pretending
to
have
an
opinion
;
but
I
should
not
have
found
out
anything
against
it
of
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Where
do
you
dine
usually
,
now
you
are
in
London
?
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Vavasor
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
At
the
old
club
,
at
the
corner
of
Suffolk
Street
.
<EOS>
It
's
the
oldest
club
in
London
,
I
believe
.
<EOS>
I
never
belonged
to
any
other
,
and
therefore
ca
n't
compare
them
;
but
I
ca
n't
imagine
anything
much
nicer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
give
you
better
soup
than
ours
?
"
said
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
've
an
excellent
cook
,
"
said
Mr.
Vavasor
,
with
great
gravity
;
"
one
of
the
best
second
-
class
cooks
in
London
.
<EOS>
We
were
very
nearly
getting
him
,
but
you
nicked
him
just
in
time
.
<EOS>
I
know
him
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
great
deal
more
than
I
do
,
or
hope
to
do
.
<EOS>
There
's
another
branch
of
public
life
for
which
I
'm
quite
unfitted
.
<EOS>
I
'd
as
soon
be
called
on
to
choose
a
Prime
Minister
for
the
country
,
as
I
would
a
cook
for
a
club
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
you
would
,
"
said
Mr.
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
"
There
may
be
as
many
as
a
dozen
cooks
about
London
to
be
looked
up
,
but
there
are
never
more
than
two
possible
Prime
Ministers
about
.
<EOS>
And
as
one
of
them
must
be
going
out
when
the
other
is
coming
in
<EOS>
,
I
do
n't
see
that
there
can
be
any
difficulty
.
<EOS>
Moreover
,
now
-
a
-
days
,
people
do
their
politics
for
themselves
,
but
they
expect
to
have
their
dinners
cooked
for
them
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
little
dinner
went
on
quietly
and
very
easily
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Vavasor
found
fault
with
nearly
everything
.
<EOS>
But
as
,
on
this
occasion
,
the
meat
and
the
drink
,
with
the
manner
of
the
eating
and
drinking
,
did
not
constitute
the
difficulty
,
Alice
was
indifferent
to
her
father
's
censures
.
<EOS>
The
thing
needed
was
that
she
and
Mr.
Grey
should
be
able
to
sit
together
at
the
same
table
without
apparent
consciousness
of
their
former
ties
.
<EOS>
Alice
felt
that
she
was
succeeding
indifferently
well
while
she
was
putting
in
little
mock
defences
for
the
cook
.
<EOS>
And
as
for
John
Grey
,
he
succeeded
so
well
that
his
success
almost
made
Alice
angry
with
him
.
<EOS>
It
required
no
effort
with
him
at
all
to
be
successful
in
this
matter
.
<EOS>
"
If
he
can
forget
all
that
has
passed
,
so
much
the
better
,
"
said
Alice
to
herself
when
she
got
up
into
the
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
Then
she
sat
herself
down
on
the
sofa
,
and
cried
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
what
had
she
not
lost
!
<EOS>
Had
any
woman
ever
been
so
mad
,
so
reckless
,
so
heartless
as
she
had
been
!
<EOS>
And
she
had
done
it
,
knowing
that
she
loved
him
!
<EOS>
She
cried
bitterly
,
and
then
went
away
to
wash
her
eyes
,
that
she
might
be
ready
to
give
him
his
coffee
when
he
should
come
up
-
stairs
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
does
not
look
well
,
"
said
Grey
as
soon
as
she
had
left
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
;
 
no
:
how
can
she
look
well
after
what
she
has
gone
through
?
<EOS>
I
sometimes
think
,
that
of
all
the
people
I
ever
knew
,
she
has
been
the
most
foolish
.
<EOS>
But
,
of
course
,
it
is
not
for
me
to
say
anything
against
my
own
child
;
and
,
of
all
people
,
not
to
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nothing
that
you
could
say
against
her
would
make
any
difference
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
sometimes
fancy
that
I
know
her
better
than
you
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
think
that
she
'll
still
come
round
again
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
say
that
I
think
so
.
<EOS>
No
one
can
venture
to
say
whether
or
not
such
wounds
as
hers
may
be
cured
.
<EOS>
There
are
hearts
and
bodies
so
organized
,
that
in
them
severe
wounds
are
incurable
,
whereas
in
others
no
injury
seems
to
be
fatal
.
<EOS>
But
I
can
say
that
if
she
be
not
cured
it
shall
not
be
from
want
of
perseverance
on
my
part
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
word
,
Grey
,
I
do
n't
know
how
to
thank
you
enough
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
does
n't
seem
to
me
to
be
a
case
for
thanking
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
it
is
n't
.
<EOS>
I
know
that
well
enough
.
<EOS>
And
in
the
ordinary
way
of
the
world
no
father
would
think
of
thanking
a
man
for
wanting
to
marry
his
daughter
.
<EOS>
But
things
have
come
to
such
a
pass
with
us
,
that
,
by
George
!
<EOS>
I
do
n't
feel
like
any
other
father
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
mind
saying
anything
to
you
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
That
claret
is
n't
very
good
,
but
you
might
as
well
take
another
glass
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
I
will
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
said
that
that
was
rather
good
wine
,
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
not
just
the
thing
.
<EOS>
What
's
the
use
of
my
having
good
wine
here
,
when
nobody
comes
to
drink
it
?
<EOS>
But
,
as
I
was
saying
about
Alice
,
of
course
I
've
felt
all
this
thing
very
much
.
<EOS>
I
feel
as
though
I
were
responsible
,
and
yet
what
could
I
do
?
<EOS>
She
's
her
own
mistress
through
it
all
.
<EOS>
When
she
told
me
she
was
going
to
marry
that
horrible
miscreant
,
<EOS>
my
nephew
,
what
could
I
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
over
now
,
and
we
need
not
talk
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
very
kind
of
you
to
say
so
,
 
very
.
<EOS>
I
believe
she
's
a
good
girl
.
<EOS>
I
do
,
indeed
,
in
spite
of
it
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
've
no
doubt
of
her
being
what
you
call
a
good
girl
,
 
none
in
the
least
.
<EOS>
What
she
has
done
to
me
does
not
impair
her
goodness
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
think
you
have
ever
understood
how
much
all
this
has
been
a
matter
of
conscience
with
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Conscience
!
"
said
the
angry
father
.
<EOS>
"
I
hate
such
conscience
.
<EOS>
I
like
the
conscience
that
makes
a
girl
keep
her
word
,
and
not
bring
disgrace
upon
those
she
belongs
to
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
not
think
that
I
am
disgraced
,
"
said
Grey
,
quietly
,
"
if
she
will
come
and
be
my
wife
.
<EOS>
She
has
meant
to
do
right
,
and
has
endeavoured
to
take
care
of
the
happiness
of
other
people
rather
than
her
own
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
has
taken
very
little
care
of
mine
,
"
said
Mr.
Vavasor
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
not
be
at
all
afraid
to
trust
mine
to
her
,
 
if
she
will
let
me
do
so
.
<EOS>
But
she
has
been
wounded
sorely
,
and
it
must
take
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
,
in
the
meantime
,
what
are
we
to
do
when
she
tells
us
that
Mr.
George
Vavasor
wants
another
remittance
?
<EOS>
Two
thousand
pounds
a
quarter
comes
heavy
,
you
know
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Let
us
hope
that
he
has
had
enough
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Enough
!
<EOS>
Did
such
a
man
ever
have
enough
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Let
us
hope
,
then
,
that
she
thinks
he
has
had
enough
.
<EOS>
Come
;
 
<EOS>
may
I
go
up
-
stairs
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
yes
.
<EOS>
I
'll
follow
you
.
<EOS>
She
'll
think
that
I
mean
something
if
I
leave
you
together
.
"
  
<EOS>
From
all
this
it
will
be
seen
that
Alice
's
father
and
her
lover
still
stood
together
on
confidential
terms
.
<EOS>
Not
easily
had
Mr.
Vavasor
brought
himself
to
speak
of
his
daughter
to
John
Grey
,
in
such
language
as
he
had
now
used
;
but
he
had
been
forced
by
adverse
circumstances
to
pass
the
Rubicon
of
parental
delicacy
;
he
had
been
driven
to
tell
his
wished
-
for
son
-
in
-
law
that
he
did
wish
to
have
him
as
a
son
-
in
-
law
;
he
had
been
compelled
to
lay
aside
those
little
airs
of
reserve
with
which
a
father
generally
speaks
of
his
daughter
,
 
and
now
all
was
open
between
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
really
start
to
-
morrow
?
"
said
Grey
,
as
he
stood
close
over
Alice
's
work
-
table
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Vavasor
had
followed
him
into
the
drawing
-
room
,
but
had
seated
himself
in
an
easy
-
chair
on
the
other
side
of
the
fire
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
tone
of
whispering
in
Grey
's
voice
,
but
yet
he
spoke
in
a
manner
which
showed
that
he
did
not
intend
to
be
audible
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
start
for
Westmoreland
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
We
do
not
leave
London
for
the
continent
till
the
latter
end
of
next
week
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
will
not
be
here
again
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
I
shall
not
come
back
to
Queen
Anne
Street
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
will
be
away
for
many
months
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Mr.
Palliser
talked
of
next
Easter
as
the
term
of
his
return
.
<EOS>
He
mentioned
Easter
to
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
seen
him
myself
since
I
agreed
to
go
with
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
should
you
say
if
you
met
me
somewhere
in
your
travels
?
"
<EOS>
He
had
now
gently
seated
himself
on
the
sofa
beside
her
;
 
not
so
close
to
her
as
to
give
her
just
cause
to
move
away
,
but
yet
so
near
as
to
make
his
conversation
with
her
quite
private
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
that
will
be
very
likely
,
"
she
replied
,
not
knowing
what
to
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
is
very
likely
.
<EOS>
For
myself
,
I
hate
surprises
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
bring
myself
to
fall
in
upon
your
track
unawares
.
<EOS>
I
shall
go
abroad
,
but
it
will
not
be
till
the
late
autumn
,
when
the
summer
heats
are
gone
,
 
<EOS>
and
I
shall
endeavour
to
find
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
To
find
me
,
Mr.
Grey
!
<EOS>
"
There
was
a
quivering
in
her
voice
,
as
she
spoke
,
which
she
could
not
prevent
,
though
she
would
have
given
worlds
to
prevent
it
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
that
will
be
quite
fair
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
will
not
be
unfair
,
I
think
,
if
I
give
you
notice
of
my
approach
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
fall
upon
you
and
your
friends
unawares
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
not
thinking
of
them
.
<EOS>
They
would
be
glad
to
know
you
,
of
course
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
equally
,
of
course
!
<EOS>
or
,
rather
,
much
more
of
course
,
you
will
not
be
glad
to
see
me
?
<EOS>
That
's
what
you
mean
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
mean
that
we
had
better
not
meet
more
than
we
can
help
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
differently
,
Alice
,
 
quite
differently
.
<EOS>
The
more
we
meet
the
better
,
 
<EOS>
that
is
what
I
think
.
<EOS>
But
I
will
not
stop
to
trouble
you
now
.
<EOS>
Good
night
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Then
he
got
up
and
went
away
,
and
her
father
went
with
him
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Vavasor
,
as
he
rose
from
his
chair
,
declared
that
he
would
just
walk
through
a
couple
of
streets
;
but
Alice
knew
that
he
was
gone
to
his
club
.
   
<EOS>
The
Rocks
and
Valleys
.
 
<EOS>
During
these
days
Mrs.
Greenow
was
mistress
of
the
old
Hall
down
in
Westmoreland
,
and
was
nursing
Kate
assiduously
through
the
calamity
of
her
broken
arm
.
<EOS>
There
had
come
to
be
a
considerable
amount
of
confidence
between
the
aunt
and
the
niece
.
<EOS>
Kate
had
acknowledged
to
her
aunt
that
her
brother
had
behaved
badly
,
 
very
badly
;
and
the
aunt
had
confessed
to
the
niece
that
she
regarded
Captain
Bellfield
as
a
fit
subject
for
compassion
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
he
was
violent
to
you
,
and
broke
your
arm
?
<EOS>
I
always
knew
it
was
so
,
"
Mrs.
Greenow
had
said
,
speaking
with
reference
to
her
nephew
.
<EOS>
But
this
Kate
had
denied
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
"
said
she
;
"
that
was
an
accident
.
<EOS>
When
he
went
away
and
left
me
,
he
knew
nothing
about
it
.
<EOS>
And
if
he
had
broken
both
my
arms
I
should
not
have
cared
much
.
<EOS>
I
could
have
forgiven
him
that
.
"
<EOS>
But
that
which
Kate
could
not
forgive
him
was
the
fault
which
she
had
herself
committed
.
<EOS>
For
his
sake
she
had
done
her
best
to
separate
Alice
and
John
Grey
,
and
George
had
shown
himself
to
be
unworthy
of
the
kindness
of
her
treachery
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
give
all
I
have
in
the
world
to
bring
them
together
again
,
"
Kate
said
.
<EOS>
"
They
'll
come
together
fast
enough
if
they
like
each
other
,
"
said
Mrs.
Greenow
.
<EOS>
"
Alice
is
young
still
,
and
they
tell
me
she
's
as
good
looking
as
ever
.
<EOS>
A
girl
with
her
money
wo
n't
have
far
to
seek
for
a
husband
,
even
if
this
paragon
from
Cambridgeshire
should
not
turn
up
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
know
Alice
,
aunt
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
do
n't
.
<EOS>
But
I
know
what
young
women
are
,
and
I
know
what
young
men
are
.
<EOS>
All
this
nonsense
about
her
cousin
George
,
 
what
difference
will
it
make
?
<EOS>
A
man
like
Mr.
Grey
wo
n't
care
about
that
,
 
especially
not
if
she
tells
him
all
about
it
.
<EOS>
My
belief
is
that
a
girl
can
have
anything
forgiven
her
,
if
she
'll
only
tell
it
herself
.
"
  
<EOS>
But
Kate
preferred
the
other
subject
,
and
<EOS>
so
,
I
think
,
did
Mrs.
Greenow
herself
.
<EOS>
"
Of
course
,
my
dear
,
"
she
would
say
,
"
marriage
with
me
,
if
I
should
marry
again
,
would
be
a
very
different
thing
to
your
marriage
,
or
that
of
any
other
young
person
.
<EOS>
As
for
love
,
that
has
been
all
over
for
me
since
poor
Greenow
died
.
<EOS>
I
have
known
nothing
of
the
softness
of
affection
since
I
laid
him
in
his
cold
grave
,
and
never
can
again
.
"
<EOS>
Captain
Bellfield
,
"
<EOS>
I
said
to
him
,
"
if
you
were
to
kneel
at
my
feet
for
years
,
it
would
not
make
me
care
for
you
in
the
way
of
love
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
what
did
he
say
to
that
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
am
I
to
tell
you
what
he
said
?
<EOS>
He
talked
nonsense
about
my
beauty
,
as
all
the
men
do
.
<EOS>
If
a
woman
were
hump
-
backed
,
and
had
only
one
eye
,
they
would
n't
be
ashamed
to
tell
her
she
was
a
Venus
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
aunt
,
you
are
a
handsome
woman
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Laws
,
my
dear
,
as
if
I
did
n't
understand
all
about
it
;
as
if
I
did
n't
know
what
makes
a
woman
run
after
?
<EOS>
It
is
n't
beauty
,
 
and
it
is
n't
money
altogether
.
<EOS>
I
've
seen
women
who
had
plenty
of
both
,
and
not
a
man
would
come
nigh
them
.
<EOS>
They
did
n't
dare
.
<EOS>
There
are
some
of
them
,
a
man
would
as
soon
think
of
putting
his
arm
round
a
poplar
tree
,
they
are
so
hard
and
so
stiff
.
<EOS>
You
know
you
're
a
little
that
way
yourself
,
Kate
,
and
<EOS>
I
've
always
told
you
it
wo
n't
do
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
afraid
I
'm
too
old
to
mend
,
aunt
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
at
all
,
if
you
'll
only
set
your
wits
to
work
and
try
.
<EOS>
You
've
plenty
of
money
now
,
and
you
're
good
-
looking
enough
,
too
,
when
you
take
the
trouble
to
get
yourself
up
.
<EOS>
But
,
as
I
said
before
,
it
is
n't
that
that
's
wanted
.
<EOS>
There
's
a
stand
-
off
about
some
women
,
 
what
the
men
call
a
"
nollimy
tangere
,
"
that
a
man
must
be
quite
a
furious
Orlando
to
attempt
to
get
the
better
of
it
.
<EOS>
They
look
as
though
matrimony
itself
were
improper
,
and
as
if
they
believed
that
little
babies
were
found
about
in
the
hedges
and
ditches
.
<EOS>
They
talk
of
women
being
forward
!
<EOS>
There
are
some
of
them
a
deal
too
backward
,
according
to
my
way
of
thinking
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yours
is
a
comfortable
doctrine
,
aunt
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
just
what
I
want
it
to
be
.
<EOS>
I
want
things
to
be
comfortable
.
<EOS>
Why
should
n't
things
be
nice
about
one
when
one
's
got
the
means
?
<EOS>
Nobody
can
say
it
's
a
pleasant
thing
to
live
alone
.
<EOS>
I
always
thought
that
man
in
the
song
hit
it
off
properly
.
<EOS>
You
remember
what
he
says
?
<EOS>
"
The
poker
and
tongs
to
each
other
belongs
.
"
<EOS>
So
they
do
,
and
that
should
be
the
way
with
men
and
women
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
the
poker
and
tongs
have
but
a
bad
life
of
it
sometimes
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Not
so
often
as
the
people
say
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
Men
and
women
ai
n't
like
lumps
of
sugar
.
<EOS>
They
do
n't
melt
because
the
water
is
sometimes
warm
.
<EOS>
Now
,
if
I
do
take
Bellfield
,
 
and
I
really
think
I
shall
;
but
if
I
do
he
'll
give
me
a
deal
of
trouble
.
<EOS>
I
know
he
will
.
<EOS>
He
'll
always
be
wanting
my
money
,
and
,
of
course
,
he
'll
get
more
than
he
ought
.
<EOS>
I
'm
not
a
Solomon
,
nor
yet
a
Queen
of
Sheba
,
no
more
than
anybody
else
.
<EOS>
And
he
'll
smoke
too
many
cigars
,
and
perhaps
drink
more
brandy
-
and
-
water
than
he
ought
.
<EOS>
And
he
'll
be
making
eyes
,
too
,
at
some
of
the
girls
who
'll
be
fools
enough
to
let
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
,
aunt
,
if
I
thought
all
that
ill
of
him
,
I
'm
sure
I
would
n't
marry
him
;
 
especially
as
you
say
you
do
n't
love
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
As
for
love
,
my
dear
,
that
's
gone
,
 
clear
gone
!
"
<EOS>
Whereupon
Mrs.
Greenow
put
up
her
handkerchief
to
her
eyes
.
<EOS>
"
Some
women
can
love
twice
,
but
I
am
not
one
of
them
.
<EOS>
I
wish
I
could
,
 
I
wish
I
could
!
"
<EOS>
These
last
words
were
spoken
in
a
tone
of
solemn
regret
,
which
,
however
,
she
contrived
to
change
as
quickly
as
she
had
adopted
it
.
"
<EOS>
But
my
dear
,
marriage
is
a
comfortable
thing
.
<EOS>
And
then
,
though
the
Captain
may
be
a
little
free
,
I
do
n't
doubt
but
<EOS>
what
I
shall
get
the
upper
hand
with
him
at
last
.
<EOS>
I
sha
n't
stop
his
cigars
and
brandy
-
and
-
water
you
know
.
<EOS>
Why
should
n't
a
man
smoke
and
have
a
glass
,
if
he
do
n't
make
a
beast
of
himself
?
<EOS>
I
like
to
see
a
man
enjoy
himself
.
<EOS>
And
then
,
"
she
added
,
speaking
tenderly
of
her
absent
lover
,
"
I
do
think
he
's
fond
of
me
,
 
I
do
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
So
is
Mr.
Cheesacre
for
the
matter
of
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Poor
Cheesy
!
<EOS>
I
believe
he
was
,
though
he
did
talk
so
much
about
money
.
<EOS>
I
always
like
to
believe
the
best
I
can
of
them
.
<EOS>
But
then
there
was
no
poetry
about
Cheesy
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
care
about
saying
it
now
,
as
you
've
quite
made
up
your
mind
not
to
have
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Quite
,
aunt
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Your
grandfather
's
will
does
make
a
difference
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
But
,
as
I
was
saying
,
I
do
like
a
little
romance
about
them
,
 
just
a
sniff
,
as
I
call
it
,
of
the
rocks
and
valleys
.
<EOS>
One
knows
that
it
does
n't
mean
much
;
but
it
's
like
artificial
flowers
,
 
it
gives
a
little
colour
,
and
takes
off
the
dowdiness
.
<EOS>
Of
course
,
bread
-
and
-
cheese
is
the
real
thing
.
<EOS>
The
rocks
and
valleys
are
no
good
at
all
,
if
you
have
n't
got
that
,
But
enough
is
as
good
as
a
feast
.
<EOS>
Thanks
to
dear
Greenow
,
"
 
here
the
handkerchief
was
again
used
 
"
Thanks
to
dear
Greenow
,
I
shall
never
want
.
<EOS>
Of
course
I
sha
n't
let
any
of
the
money
go
into
his
hands
,
 
the
Captain
's
,
I
mean
.
<EOS>
I
know
a
trick
worth
two
of
that
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
But
,
lord
love
you
!
<EOS>
I
've
enough
for
him
and
me
.
<EOS>
What
's
the
good
of
a
woman
's
wanting
to
keep
it
all
to
herself
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
think
you
'll
really
take
him
,
aunt
,
and
pay
his
washerwoman
's
bills
for
him
?
<EOS>
You
remember
what
you
told
me
when
I
first
saw
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
yes
;
I
remember
.
<EOS>
And
if
he
ca
n't
pay
his
own
washerwoman
,
is
n't
that
so
much
more
of
a
reason
that
I
should
do
it
for
him
?
<EOS>
Well
;
yes
;
I
think
I
will
take
him
.
<EOS>
That
is
,
if
he
lets
me
take
him
just
as
I
choose
.
<EOS>
Beggars
must
n't
be
choosers
,
my
dear
.
"
  
<EOS>
In
this
way
the
aunt
and
niece
became
very
confidential
,
and
Mrs.
Greenow
whispered
into
Kate
's
ears
her
belief
that
Captain
Bellfield
might
possibly
make
his
way
across
the
country
to
Westmoreland
.
<EOS>
"
There
would
be
no
harm
in
offering
him
a
bed
,
would
there
?
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Greenow
asked
.
<EOS>
"
You
see
the
inn
at
Shap
is
a
long
way
off
for
morning
calls
.
<EOS>
"
Kate
could
not
take
upon
herself
to
say
that
there
would
be
any
harm
,
but
she
did
not
like
the
idea
of
having
Captain
Bellfield
as
a
visitor
.
<EOS>
"
After
all
,
perhaps
he
may
n't
come
,
"
said
the
widow
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
see
where
he
is
to
raise
the
money
for
such
a
journey
,
now
that
he
has
quarrelled
with
Mr.
Cheesacre
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
Captain
Bellfield
must
come
to
Vavasor
Hall
,
at
any
rate
let
him
not
come
till
Alice
's
visit
had
been
completed
.
<EOS>
"
That
was
Kate
's
present
wish
,
and
so
much
she
ventured
to
confide
to
her
aunt
.
<EOS>
But
there
seemed
to
be
no
way
of
stopping
him
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
in
the
least
know
where
he
is
,
my
dear
,
and
as
for
writing
to
him
,
I
never
did
such
a
thing
in
my
life
,
and
I
should
n't
know
how
to
begin
.
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Greenow
declared
that
she
had
not
positively
invited
the
Captain
;
but
on
this
point
Kate
hardly
gave
full
credit
to
her
aunt
's
statement
.
  
<EOS>
Alice
arrived
,
and
,
for
a
day
or
two
,
the
three
ladies
lived
very
pleasantly
together
.
<EOS>
Kate
still
wore
her
arm
in
a
sling
;
but
she
was
able
to
walk
out
,
and
would
take
long
walks
in
spite
of
the
doctor
's
prohibition
.
<EOS>
Of
course
,
they
went
up
on
the
mountains
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
all
the
walks
from
Vavasor
Hall
led
to
the
mountains
,
unless
one
chose
to
take
the
road
to
Shap
.
<EOS>
But
they
went
up
,
across
the
beacon
hill
,
as
though
by
mutual
consent
.
<EOS>
There
were
no
questions
asked
between
them
as
to
the
route
to
be
taken
;
and
though
they
did
not
reach
the
stone
on
which
they
had
once
sat
looking
over
upon
Haweswater
,
they
did
reach
the
spot
upon
which
Kate
had
encountered
her
accident
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
here
I
fell
,
"
she
said
;
"
and
the
last
I
saw
of
him
was
his
back
,
as
he
made
his
way
down
into
the
valley
,
there
.
<EOS>
When
I
got
upon
my
legs
I
could
still
see
him
.
<EOS>
It
was
one
of
those
evenings
when
the
clouds
are
dark
,
but
you
can
see
all
objects
with
a
peculiar
clearness
through
the
air
.
<EOS>
I
stood
here
ever
so
long
,
holding
my
arm
,
and
watching
him
;
but
he
never
once
turned
to
look
back
at
me
.
<EOS>
Do
you
know
,
Alice
,
I
fancy
that
I
shall
never
see
him
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
suppose
that
he
means
to
quarrel
with
you
altogether
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
hardly
tell
you
what
I
mean
!
<EOS>
He
seemed
to
me
to
be
going
away
from
me
,
as
though
he
went
into
another
world
.
<EOS>
His
figure
against
the
light
was
quite
clear
,
and
he
walked
quickly
,
and
on
he
went
,
till
the
slope
of
the
hill
hid
him
from
me
.
<EOS>
Of
course
,
I
thought
that
he
would
return
to
the
Hall
.
<EOS>
At
one
time
I
almost
feared
that
he
would
come
upon
me
through
the
woods
,
as
I
went
back
myself
.
<EOS>
But
yet
,
I
had
a
feeling
,
 
what
people
call
a
presentiment
,
that
I
should
never
see
him
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
has
never
written
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
not
a
word
.
<EOS>
You
must
remember
that
he
did
not
know
that
I
had
hurt
myself
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
he
will
not
write
,
and
I
am
sure
,
also
,
that
I
shall
not
.
<EOS>
If
he
wanted
money
I
would
send
it
to
him
,
but
I
would
not
write
to
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
fear
he
will
always
want
money
,
Kate
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
fear
he
will
.
<EOS>
If
you
could
know
what
I
suffered
when
he
made
me
write
that
letter
to
you
!
<EOS>
But
,
of
course
,
I
was
a
beast
.
<EOS>
Of
course
,
I
ought
not
to
have
written
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
thought
it
a
very
proper
letter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
a
mean
letter
.
<EOS>
The
whole
thing
was
mean
!
<EOS>
He
should
have
starved
in
the
street
before
he
had
taken
your
money
.
<EOS>
He
should
have
given
up
Parliament
,
and
everything
else
!
<EOS>
I
had
doubted
much
about
him
before
,
but
it
was
that
which
first
turned
my
heart
against
him
.
<EOS>
I
had
begun
to
fear
that
he
was
not
such
a
man
as
I
had
always
thought
him
,
 
as
I
had
spoken
of
him
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
had
judged
of
him
for
myself
,
"
said
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
you
did
.
<EOS>
But
I
had
endeavoured
to
make
you
judge
kindly
.
<EOS>
Alice
,
dear
!
<EOS>
we
have
both
suffered
for
him
;
you
more
than
I
,
perhaps
;
but
I
,
too
,
have
given
up
everything
for
him
.
<EOS>
My
whole
life
has
been
at
his
service
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
his
creature
,
to
do
his
bidding
,
just
as
he
might
tell
me
.
<EOS>
He
made
me
do
things
that
I
knew
to
be
wrong
,
 
<EOS>
things
that
were
foreign
to
my
own
nature
;
and
yet
I
almost
worshipped
him
.
<EOS>
Even
now
,
if
he
were
to
come
back
,
I
believe
that
I
should
forgive
him
everything
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
forgive
him
,
but
I
could
never
do
more
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
he
will
never
come
back
.
<EOS>
He
will
never
ask
us
to
forgive
him
,
or
even
wish
it
.
<EOS>
He
has
no
heart
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
has
longed
for
money
till
the
Devil
has
hardened
his
heart
,
"
said
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
yet
how
tender
he
could
be
in
his
manner
when
he
chose
it
;
 
<EOS>
how
soft
he
could
make
his
words
and
his
looks
!
<EOS>
Do
you
remember
how
he
behaved
to
us
in
Switzerland
?
<EOS>
Do
you
remember
that
balcony
at
Basle
,
and
the
night
we
sat
there
,
when
the
boys
were
swimming
down
the
river
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
 
I
remember
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
So
do
I
!
<EOS>
So
do
I
!
<EOS>
Alice
,
I
would
give
all
I
have
in
the
world
,
if
I
could
recall
that
journey
to
Switzerland
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
mean
for
my
sake
,
Kate
 
"
  
"
I
do
mean
for
your
sake
.
<EOS>
It
made
no
difference
to
me
.
<EOS>
Whether
I
stayed
in
Westmoreland
or
went
abroad
,
I
must
have
found
out
that
my
god
was
made
of
bricks
and
clay
instead
of
gold
.
<EOS>
But
there
was
no
need
for
you
to
be
crushed
in
the
ruins
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
crushed
,
Kate
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
,
you
are
too
proud
to
own
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
mean
about
Mr.
Grey
,
that
would
have
happened
just
the
same
,
whether
I
had
gone
abroad
or
remained
at
home
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Would
it
,
dear
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Just
the
same
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
nothing
more
than
this
said
between
them
about
Mr.
Grey
.
<EOS>
Even
to
her
cousin
,
Alice
could
not
bring
herself
to
talk
freely
on
that
subject
.
<EOS>
She
would
never
allow
herself
to
think
,
for
a
moment
,
that
she
had
been
persuaded
by
others
to
treat
him
as
she
had
treated
him
.
<EOS>
She
was
sure
that
she
had
acted
on
her
own
convictions
of
what
was
right
and
wrong
;
and
now
,
though
she
had
begun
to
feel
that
she
had
been
wrong
,
she
would
hardly
confess
as
much
even
to
herself
.
  
<EOS>
They
walked
back
,
down
the
hill
,
to
the
Hall
in
silence
for
the
greater
part
of
the
way
.
<EOS>
Once
or
twice
Kate
repeated
her
conviction
that
she
should
never
again
see
her
brother
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
what
may
happen
to
him
,
"
she
said
in
answer
to
her
cousin
's
questions
;
"
but
when
he
was
passing
out
of
my
sight
into
the
valley
,
I
felt
that
I
was
looking
at
him
for
the
last
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
simply
what
people
call
a
presentiment
,
"
Alice
replied
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Exactly
so
;
and
presentiments
,
of
course
,
mean
nothing
,
"
said
Kate
.
  
<EOS>
Then
they
walked
on
towards
the
house
without
further
speech
;
but
when
they
reached
the
end
of
the
little
path
which
led
out
of
the
wood
,
on
to
the
gravelled
sweep
before
the
front
door
,
they
were
both
arrested
by
a
sight
that
met
their
eyes
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
man
standing
,
with
a
cigar
in
his
mouth
,
before
them
,
swinging
a
little
cane
,
and
looking
about
him
up
at
the
wood
.
<EOS>
He
had
on
his
head
a
jaunty
little
straw
-
hat
,
and
he
wore
a
jacket
with
brass
buttons
,
and
white
trousers
.
<EOS>
It
was
now
nearly
the
middle
of
May
,
but
the
summer
does
not
come
to
Westmoreland
so
early
as
that
,
and
the
man
,
as
he
stood
there
looking
about
him
,
seemed
to
be
cold
and
almost
uncomfortable
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
as
yet
seen
the
two
girls
,
who
stood
at
the
end
of
the
walk
,
arrested
by
the
sight
of
him
.
<EOS>
"
Who
is
it
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Alice
,
in
a
whisper
.
  
<EOS>
"
Captain
Bellfield
,
"
said
Kate
,
speaking
with
something
very
like
dismay
in
her
voice
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
!
<EOS>
aunt
Greenow
's
Captain
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
aunt
Greenow
's
Captain
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
fearing
this
,
and
now
,
what
on
earth
are
we
to
do
with
him
?
<EOS>
Look
at
him
.
<EOS>
That
's
what
aunt
Greenow
calls
a
sniff
of
the
rocks
and
valleys
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
Captain
began
to
move
,
 
just
to
move
,
as
though
it
were
necessary
to
do
something
to
keep
the
life
in
his
limbs
.
<EOS>
He
had
finished
his
cigar
,
and
looked
at
the
end
of
it
with
manifest
regret
.
<EOS>
As
he
threw
it
away
among
a
tuft
of
shrubs
his
eye
fell
upon
the
two
ladies
,
and
he
uttered
a
little
exclamation
.
<EOS>
Then
he
came
forward
,
waving
his
little
straw
-
hat
in
his
hand
,
and
made
his
salutation
.
"
<EOS>
Miss
Vavasor
,
I
am
delighted
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Miss
Alice
Vavasor
,
if
I
am
not
mistaken
?
<EOS>
I
have
been
commissioned
by
my
dear
friend
Mrs.
Greenow
to
go
out
and
seek
you
,
but
,
upon
my
word
,
the
woods
looked
so
black
that
I
did
not
dare
to
venture
;
 
and
then
,
of
course
,
I
should
n't
have
found
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Kate
put
out
her
left
hand
,
and
then
introduced
her
cousin
to
the
Captain
.
<EOS>
Again
he
waved
his
little
straw
-
hat
,
and
strove
to
bear
himself
as
though
he
were
at
home
and
comfortable
.
<EOS>
But
he
failed
,
and
it
was
manifest
that
he
failed
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
the
Bellfield
who
had
conquered
Mr.
Cheesacre
on
the
sands
at
Yarmouth
,
though
he
wore
the
same
jacket
and
waistcoat
,
and
must
now
have
enjoyed
the
internal
satisfaction
of
feeling
that
his
future
maintenance
in
life
was
assured
to
him
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
not
at
his
ease
.
<EOS>
His
courage
had
sufficed
to
enable
him
to
follow
his
quarry
into
Westmoreland
,
but
it
did
not
suffice
to
make
him
comfortable
while
he
was
there
.
<EOS>
Kate
instantly
perceived
his
condition
,
and
wickedly
resolved
that
she
would
make
no
effort
to
assist
him
.
<EOS>
She
went
through
some
ceremony
of
introduction
,
and
then
expressed
her
surprise
at
seeing
him
so
far
north
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
said
he
;
"
I
am
a
little
surprised
myself
;
 
I
am
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
But
I
had
nothing
to
do
in
Norwich
,
 
literally
nothing
;
and
your
aunt
had
so
often
talked
to
me
of
the
beauties
of
this
place
,
"
 
and
he
waved
his
hand
round
at
the
old
house
and
the
dark
trees
<EOS>
,
 
"
that
I
thought
I
'd
take
the
liberty
of
paying
you
a
flying
visit
.
<EOS>
I
did
n't
mean
to
intrude
in
the
way
of
sleeping
;
I
did
n't
indeed
,
Miss
Vavasor
;
only
Mrs.
Greenow
has
been
so
kind
as
to
say
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
We
are
so
very
far
out
of
the
world
,
Captain
Bellfield
,
that
we
always
give
our
visitors
beds
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
intend
it
;
I
did
n't
indeed
,
miss
!
"
<EOS>
Poor
Captain
Bellfield
was
becoming
very
uneasy
in
his
agitation
.
<EOS>
"
I
did
just
put
my
bag
,
with
a
change
of
things
,
into
the
gig
,
which
brought
me
over
,
not
knowing
quite
where
I
might
go
on
to
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
wo
n't
send
you
any
further
to
-
day
,
at
any
rate
,
"
said
Kate
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Greenow
has
been
very
kind
,
 
very
kind
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
She
has
asked
me
to
stay
till
 
Saturday
!
"
  
<EOS>
Kate
bit
her
lips
in
a
momentary
fit
of
anger
.
<EOS>
The
house
was
her
house
,
and
not
her
aunt
's
.
<EOS>
But
she
remembered
that
her
aunt
had
been
kind
to
her
at
Norwich
and
at
Yarmouth
,
and
she
allowed
this
feeling
to
die
away
.
<EOS>
"
We
shall
be
very
glad
to
see
you
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
We
are
three
women
together
here
,
and
I
'm
afraid
you
will
find
us
rather
dull
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
dear
,
no
,
 
dull
with
you
!
<EOS>
That
would
be
impossible
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
how
have
you
left
your
friend
,
Mr.
Cheesacre
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Quite
well
;
 
very
well
,
thank
you
.
<EOS>
That
is
to
say
,
I
have
n't
seen
him
much
lately
.
<EOS>
He
and
I
did
have
a
bit
of
a
breeze
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
say
that
I
did
know
,
Captain
Bellfield
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
thought
,
perhaps
,
you
had
heard
.
<EOS>
He
seemed
to
think
that
I
was
too
particular
in
a
certain
quarter
!
<EOS>
Ha
 
ha
 
ha
 
ha
!
<EOS>
That
's
only
my
joke
,
you
know
,
ladies
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
They
then
went
into
the
house
,
and
the
Captain
straggled
in
after
them
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Greenow
was
in
neither
of
the
two
sitting
-
rooms
which
they
usually
occupied
.
<EOS>
She
,
too
,
had
been
driven
somewhat
out
of
the
ordinary
composure
of
her
manner
by
the
arrival
of
her
lover
,
 
even
though
she
had
expected
it
,
and
had
retired
to
her
room
,
thinking
that
she
had
better
see
Kate
in
private
before
they
met
in
the
presence
of
the
Captain
.
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
you
have
seen
my
aunt
since
you
have
been
here
?
"
said
Kate
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
dear
,
yes
.
<EOS>
I
saw
her
,
and
she
suggested
that
I
had
better
walk
out
and
find
you
.
<EOS>
I
did
find
you
,
you
know
,
though
I
did
n't
walk
very
far
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
have
you
seen
your
room
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
;
 
yes
.
<EOS>
She
was
kind
enough
to
show
me
my
room
.
<EOS>
Very
nice
indeed
,
thank
you
;
 
looking
out
into
the
front
,
and
all
that
kind
of
thing
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
poor
fellow
was
no
doubt
thinking
how
much
better
was
his
lot
at
Vavasor
Hall
than
it
had
been
at
Oileymead
.
<EOS>
"
I
sha
n't
stay
long
,
Miss
Vavasor
,
 
only
just
a
night
or
so
;
but
I
did
want
to
see
your
aunt
again
,
 
and
you
,
too
,
upon
my
word
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
aunt
is
the
attraction
,
Captain
Bellfield
.
<EOS>
We
all
know
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
actually
simpered
,
 
simpered
like
a
young
girl
who
is
half
elated
and
half
ashamed
when
her
lover
is
thrown
in
her
teeth
.
<EOS>
He
fidgeted
with
the
things
on
the
table
,
and
moved
himself
about
uneasily
from
one
leg
to
the
other
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
he
was
remembering
that
though
he
had
contrived
to
bring
himself
to
Vavasor
Hall
he
had
not
money
enough
left
to
take
him
back
to
Norwich
.
<EOS>
The
two
girls
left
him
and
went
to
their
rooms
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
go
to
my
aunt
at
once
,
"
said
Kate
,
"
and
find
out
what
is
to
be
done
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
she
means
to
marry
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
yes
;
she
means
to
marry
him
,
and
the
sooner
the
better
now
.
<EOS>
I
knew
this
was
coming
,
but
I
did
so
hope
it
would
not
be
while
you
were
here
.
<EOS>
It
makes
me
feel
so
ashamed
of
myself
that
you
should
see
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Kate
boldly
knocked
at
her
aunt
's
door
,
and
her
aunt
received
her
with
a
conscious
smile
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
waiting
for
you
to
come
,
"
said
Mrs.
Greenow
.
  
<EOS>
"
Here
I
am
,
aunt
;
and
,
what
is
more
to
the
purpose
,
there
is
Captain
Bellfield
in
the
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Stupid
man
!
<EOS>
I
told
him
to
take
himself
away
about
the
place
till
dinner
-
time
.
<EOS>
I
've
half
a
mind
to
send
him
back
to
Shap
at
once
;
 
upon
my
word
I
have
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
n't
do
that
,
aunt
;
it
would
be
inhospitable
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
he
is
such
an
oaf
.
<EOS>
I
hope
you
understand
,
<EOS>
my
dear
,
that
I
could
n't
help
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
do
mean
to
 
to
marry
him
,
aunt
;
do
n't
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Kate
,
I
really
think
I
do
.
<EOS>
Why
should
n't
I
?
<EOS>
It
's
a
lonely
sort
of
life
being
by
myself
;
and
,
upon
my
word
,
I
do
n't
think
there
's
very
much
harm
in
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
saying
anything
against
him
;
only
in
that
case
you
ca
n't
very
well
turn
him
out
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Could
not
I
,
though
?
<EOS>
I
could
in
a
minute
;
and
,
if
you
wish
it
,
you
shall
see
if
I
ca
n't
do
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
rocks
and
valleys
would
not
allow
that
,
aunt
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
all
very
well
for
you
to
laugh
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
If
laughing
would
break
my
bones
I
should
n't
be
as
whole
as
I
am
now
.
<EOS>
I
might
have
had
Cheesacre
if
I
liked
,
who
is
a
substantial
man
,
and
could
have
kept
a
carriage
for
me
;
but
it
was
the
rocks
and
valleys
that
prevented
that
;
 
and
perhaps
a
little
feeling
that
I
might
do
some
good
to
a
poor
fellow
who
has
nobody
in
the
world
to
look
after
him
.
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Greenow
,
as
she
said
this
,
put
her
handkerchief
up
to
her
eyes
,
and
wiped
away
the
springing
moisture
.
<EOS>
Tears
were
always
easy
with
her
,
but
on
this
occasion
Kate
almost
respected
her
tears
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
sure
I
hope
you
'll
be
happy
,
aunt
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
he
makes
me
unhappy
he
shall
pay
for
it
;
"
and
Mrs.
Greenow
,
having
done
with
the
tears
,
shook
her
head
,
as
though
upon
this
occasion
she
quite
meant
all
that
she
said
.
  
<EOS>
At
dinner
they
were
not
very
comfortable
.
<EOS>
Either
the
gloomy
air
of
the
place
and
the
neighbourhood
of
the
black
pines
had
depressed
the
Captain
,
or
else
the
glorious
richness
of
the
prospects
before
him
had
made
him
thoughtful
.
<EOS>
He
had
laid
aside
the
jacket
with
the
brass
buttons
,
and
had
dressed
himself
for
dinner
very
soberly
.
<EOS>
And
he
behaved
himself
at
dinner
and
after
dinner
with
a
wonderful
sobriety
,
being
very
unlike
the
Captain
who
had
sat
at
the
head
of
the
table
at
Mrs.
Greenow
's
picnic
.
<EOS>
When
left
to
himself
after
dinner
he
barely
swallowed
two
glasses
of
the
old
Squire
's
port
wine
before
he
sauntered
out
into
the
garden
to
join
the
ladies
,
whom
he
had
seen
there
;
and
when
pressed
by
Kate
to
light
a
cigar
he
positively
declined
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
following
morning
Mrs.
Greenow
had
recovered
her
composure
,
but
Captain
Bellfield
was
still
in
a
rather
disturbed
state
of
mind
.
<EOS>
He
knew
that
his
efforts
were
to
be
crowned
with
success
,
and
that
he
was
sure
of
his
wife
,
but
he
did
not
know
how
the
preliminary
difficulties
were
to
be
overcome
,
and
he
did
not
know
what
to
do
with
himself
at
the
Hall
.
<EOS>
After
breakfast
he
fidgeted
about
in
the
parlour
,
being
unable
to
contrive
for
himself
a
mode
of
escape
,
and
was
absolutely
thrown
upon
his
beam
-
ends
when
the
widow
asked
him
what
he
meant
to
do
with
himself
between
that
and
dinner
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
I
'd
better
take
a
walk
,
"
he
said
;
"
and
perhaps
the
young
ladies
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
If
you
mean
my
two
nieces
,
"
said
Mrs.
Greenow
,
"
I
'm
afraid
you
'll
find
they
are
engaged
.
<EOS>
But
if
I
'm
not
too
old
to
walk
with
 
<EOS>
"
The
Captain
assured
her
that
she
was
just
of
the
proper
age
for
a
walking
companion
,
as
far
as
his
taste
went
,
and
then
attempted
some
apology
for
the
awkwardness
of
his
expression
,
at
which
the
three
women
laughed
heartily
.
"
<EOS>
Never
mind
,
Captain
,
"
said
Mrs.
Greenow
.
<EOS>
"
We
'll
have
our
walk
all
the
same
,
and
wo
n't
mind
those
young
girls
.
<EOS>
Come
along
.
<EOS>
"
They
started
,
not
up
towards
the
mountains
,
as
Kate
always
did
when
she
walked
in
Westmoreland
,
but
mildly
,
and
at
a
gentle
pace
,
as
beseemed
their
years
,
along
the
road
towards
Shap
.
<EOS>
The
Captain
politely
opened
the
old
gate
for
the
widow
,
and
then
carefully
closed
it
again
,
 
not
allowing
it
to
swing
,
as
he
would
have
done
at
Yarmouth
.
<EOS>
Then
he
tripped
up
to
his
place
beside
her
,
suggested
his
arm
,
which
she
declined
,
and
walked
on
for
some
paces
in
silence
.
<EOS>
What
on
earth
was
he
to
say
to
her
?
<EOS>
He
had
done
his
love
-
making
successfully
,
and
what
was
he
to
do
next
?
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Captain
Bellfield
,
"
said
she
.
<EOS>
They
were
walking
very
slowly
,
and
he
was
cutting
the
weeds
by
the
roadside
with
his
cane
.
<EOS>
He
knew
by
her
voice
that
something
special
was
coming
,
so
he
left
the
weeds
and
ranged
himself
close
up
alongside
of
her
.
"
<EOS>
Well
,
Captain
Bellfield
,
 
<EOS>
so
I
suppose
I
'm
to
be
good
-
natured
;
am
I
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Arabella
,
you
'll
make
me
the
happiest
man
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
all
fudge
.
<EOS>
"
She
would
have
said
,
"
all
rocks
and
valleys
,
"
only
he
would
not
have
understood
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
word
,
you
will
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
I
shall
make
you
respectable
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
yes
;
certainly
.
<EOS>
I
quite
intend
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
the
great
thing
that
you
should
intend
.
<EOS>
Of
course
I
am
going
to
make
a
fool
of
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
;
do
n't
say
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
do
n't
say
it
,
all
my
friends
will
say
it
for
me
.
<EOS>
It
's
lucky
for
you
that
I
do
n't
much
care
what
people
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
It
is
lucky
;
 
I
know
that
I
'm
lucky
.
<EOS>
The
very
first
day
I
saw
you
<EOS>
I
thought
what
a
happy
fellow
I
was
to
meet
you
.
<EOS>
Then
,
of
course
,
I
was
only
thinking
of
your
beauty
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Get
along
with
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
word
,
yes
.
<EOS>
Come
,
Arabella
,
as
we
are
to
be
man
and
wife
,
you
might
as
well
.
<EOS>
"
At
this
moment
he
had
got
very
close
to
her
,
and
had
recovered
something
of
his
usual
elasticity
;
but
she
would
not
allow
him
even
to
put
his
arm
round
her
waist
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Out
in
the
high
road
!
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
How
can
you
be
so
impertinent
,
 
and
so
foolish
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
might
as
well
,
you
know
,
 
just
once
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Captain
Bellfield
,
I
brought
you
out
here
not
for
such
fooling
as
that
,
but
in
order
that
we
might
have
a
little
chat
about
business
.
<EOS>
If
we
are
to
be
man
and
wife
,
as
you
say
,
we
ought
to
understand
on
what
footing
we
are
to
begin
together
.
<EOS>
I
'm
afraid
your
own
private
means
are
not
considerable
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
no
;
they
are
not
,
Mrs.
Greenow
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Have
you
anything
?
"
<EOS>
The
Captain
hesitated
,
and
poked
the
ground
with
his
cane
.
<EOS>
"
Come
,
Captain
Bellfield
,
let
us
have
the
truth
at
once
,
and
then
we
shall
understand
each
other
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
Captain
still
hesitated
,
and
said
nothing
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
have
had
something
to
live
upon
,
I
suppose
?
"
suggested
the
widow
.
<EOS>
Then
the
Captain
,
by
degrees
,
told
his
story
.
<EOS>
He
had
a
married
sister
by
whom
a
guinea
a
week
was
allowed
to
him
.
<EOS>
That
was
all
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
obliged
to
sell
out
of
the
army
,
because
he
was
unable
to
live
on
his
pay
as
a
lieutenant
.
<EOS>
The
price
of
his
commission
had
gone
to
pay
his
debts
,
and
now
,
 
yes
,
it
was
too
true
,
 
<EOS>
now
he
was
in
debt
again
.
<EOS>
He
owed
ninety
pounds
to
Cheesacre
,
thirty
-
two
pounds
ten
to
a
tailor
at
Yarmouth
,
over
seventeen
pounds
at
his
lodgings
in
Norwich
.
<EOS>
At
the
present
moment
he
had
something
under
thirty
shillings
in
his
pocket
.
<EOS>
The
tailor
at
Yarmouth
had
lent
him
three
pounds
in
order
that
he
might
make
his
journey
into
Westmoreland
,
and
perhaps
be
enabled
to
pay
his
debts
by
getting
a
rich
wife
.
<EOS>
In
the
course
of
the
cross
-
examination
Mrs.
Greenow
got
much
information
out
of
him
;
and
then
,
when
she
was
satisfied
that
she
had
learned
,
not
exactly
all
the
truth
,
but
certain
indications
of
the
truth
<EOS>
,
she
forgave
him
all
his
offences
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
now
you
will
give
a
fellow
a
kiss
,
 
just
one
kiss
,
"
said
the
ecstatic
Captain
,
in
the
height
of
his
bliss
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hush
!
"
said
the
widow
,
"
there
's
a
carriage
coming
on
the
road
 
close
to
us
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
First
Kiss
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hush
!
"
said
the
widow
,
"
there
's
a
carriage
coming
on
the
road
 
close
to
us
.
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Greenow
,
as
she
spoke
these
words
,
drew
back
from
the
Captain
's
arms
before
the
first
kiss
of
permitted
ante
-
nuptial
love
had
been
exchanged
.
<EOS>
The
scene
was
on
the
high
road
from
Shap
to
Vavasor
,
and
as
she
was
still
dressed
in
all
the
sombre
habiliments
of
early
widowhood
,
and
as
neither
he
nor
his
sweetheart
were
under
forty
,
perhaps
it
was
as
well
that
they
were
not
caught
toying
together
in
so
very
public
a
place
.
<EOS>
But
they
were
only
just
in
time
to
escape
the
vigilant
eyes
of
a
new
visitor
.
<EOS>
Round
the
corner
of
the
road
,
at
a
sharp
trot
,
came
the
Shap
post
-
horse
,
with
the
Shap
gig
behind
him
,
 
the
same
gig
which
had
brought
Bellfield
to
Vavasor
on
the
previous
day
,
 
and
seated
in
the
gig
,
looming
large
,
with
his
eyes
wide
awake
to
everything
round
him
,
was
 
Mr.
Cheesacre
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
sight
terrible
to
the
eyes
of
Captain
Bellfield
,
and
by
no
means
welcome
to
those
of
Mrs.
Greenow
.
<EOS>
As
regarded
her
,
her
annoyance
had
chiefly
reference
to
her
two
nieces
,
and
especially
to
Alice
.
<EOS>
How
was
she
to
account
for
this
second
lover
?
<EOS>
Kate
,
of
course
,
knew
all
about
it
;
but
how
could
Alice
be
made
to
understand
that
she
,
Mrs.
Greenow
,
was
not
to
blame
,
 
that
she
had
,
in
sober
truth
,
told
this
ardent
gentleman
that
there
was
no
hope
for
him
?
<EOS>
And
even
as
to
Kate
,
 
Kate
,
whom
her
aunt
had
absurdly
chosen
to
regard
as
the
object
of
Mr.
Cheesacre
's
pursuit
,
 
what
sort
of
a
welcome
would
she
extend
to
the
owner
of
Oileymead
?
<EOS>
Before
the
wheels
had
stopped
,
Mrs.
Greenow
had
begun
to
reflect
whether
it
might
be
possible
that
she
should
send
Mr.
Cheesacre
back
without
letting
him
go
on
to
the
Hall
;
but
if
Mrs.
Greenow
was
dismayed
,
what
were
the
feelings
of
the
Captain
?
<EOS>
For
he
was
aware
that
Cheesacre
knew
that
of
him
which
he
had
not
told
.
<EOS>
How
ardently
did
he
now
wish
that
he
had
sailed
nearer
to
the
truth
in
giving
in
the
schedule
of
his
debts
to
Mrs.
Greenow
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
man
's
wanted
by
the
police
,
"
said
Cheesacre
,
speaking
while
the
gig
was
still
in
motion
.
<EOS>
"
He
's
wanted
by
the
police
,
Mrs.
Greenow
,
"
and
in
his
ardour
he
stood
up
in
the
gig
and
pointed
at
Bellfield
.
<EOS>
Then
the
gig
stopped
suddenly
,
and
he
fell
back
into
his
seat
in
his
effort
to
prevent
his
falling
forward
.
<EOS>
"
He
's
wanted
by
the
police
,
"
he
shouted
out
again
,
as
soon
as
he
was
able
to
recover
his
voice
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Greenow
turned
pale
beneath
the
widow
's
veil
which
she
had
dropped
.
<EOS>
What
might
not
her
Captain
have
done
?
<EOS>
He
might
have
procured
things
,
to
be
sent
to
him
,
out
of
shops
on
false
pretences
;
or
,
urged
on
by
want
and
famine
,
he
might
have
committed
 
forgery
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
my
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
and
dropped
her
hand
from
his
arm
,
which
she
had
taken
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
false
,
"
said
Bellfield
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
true
,
"
said
Cheesacre
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
indict
you
for
slander
,
my
friend
,
"
said
Bellfield
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pay
me
the
money
you
owe
me
,
"
said
Cheesacre
.
<EOS>
"
You
're
a
swindler
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Greenow
cared
little
as
to
her
lover
being
a
swindler
in
Mr.
Cheesacre
's
estimation
.
<EOS>
Such
accusations
from
him
she
had
heard
before
.
<EOS>
But
she
did
care
very
much
as
to
this
mission
of
the
police
against
her
Captain
.
<EOS>
If
that
were
true
,
the
Captain
could
be
her
Captain
no
longer
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
is
this
I
hear
,
Captain
Bellfield
?
"
<EOS>
she
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
lie
and
a
slander
.
<EOS>
He
merely
wants
to
make
a
quarrel
between
us
.
<EOS>
What
police
are
after
me
,
Mr.
Cheesacre
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
the
police
,
or
the
sheriff
's
officer
,
or
something
of
the
kind
,
"
said
Cheesacre
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
the
sheriff
's
officers
!
"
exclaimed
Mrs.
Greenow
,
in
a
tone
of
voice
which
showed
how
great
had
been
her
relief
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Cheesacre
,
you
should
n't
come
and
say
such
things
;
 
you
should
n't
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
Sheriff
's
officers
can
be
paid
,
and
there
's
an
end
of
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
indict
him
for
the
libel
 
<EOS>
I
will
,
as
sure
as
I
'm
alive
,
"
said
Bellfield
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nonsense
,
"
said
the
widow
.
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
you
make
a
fool
of
yourself
.
<EOS>
When
men
ca
n't
pay
their
way
they
must
put
up
with
having
things
like
that
said
of
them
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Cheesacre
,
where
were
you
going
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
going
to
Vavasor
Hall
,
on
purpose
to
caution
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
too
late
,
"
said
Mrs.
Greenow
,
sinking
behind
her
veil
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
you
have
n't
been
and
married
him
since
yesterday
?
<EOS>
He
only
had
twenty
-
four
hours
"
start
of
me
,
I
know
.
<EOS>
Or
,
perhaps
,
you
had
it
done
clandestine
in
Norwich
?
<EOS>
Oh
,
Mrs.
Greenow
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
got
out
of
the
gig
,
and
the
three
walked
back
towards
the
Hall
together
,
while
the
boy
drove
on
with
Mr.
Cheesacre
's
carpetbag
.
<EOS>
"
I
hardly
know
,
"
said
Mrs.
Greenow
,
"
whether
we
can
welcome
you
.
<EOS>
There
are
other
visitors
,
and
the
house
is
full
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
not
one
to
intrude
where
I
'm
not
wanted
.
<EOS>
You
may
be
sure
of
that
.
<EOS>
If
I
ca
n't
get
my
supper
for
love
,
I
can
get
at
for
money
.
<EOS>
That
's
more
than
some
people
can
say
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
when
you
're
going
to
pay
me
what
you
owe
me
,
Lieutenant
Bellfield
?
"
  
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
the
widow
had
contrived
to
reconcile
the
two
men
before
she
reached
the
Hall
.
<EOS>
They
had
actually
shaken
hands
,
and
the
lamb
Cheesacre
had
agreed
to
lie
down
with
the
wolf
Bellfield
.
<EOS>
Cheesacre
,
moreover
,
had
contrived
to
whisper
into
the
widow
's
ears
the
true
extent
of
his
errand
into
Westmoreland
.
<EOS>
This
,
however
,
he
did
not
do
altogether
in
Bellfield
's
hearing
.
<EOS>
When
Mrs.
Greenow
ascertained
that
there
was
something
to
be
said
,
she
made
no
scruple
in
sending
her
betrothed
away
from
her
<EOS>
"
You
wo
n't
throw
a
fellow
over
,
will
you
,
now
?
"
<EOS>
whispered
Bellfield
into
her
ear
as
he
went
.
<EOS>
She
merely
frowned
at
him
,
and
bade
him
begone
,
so
that
the
walk
which
Mrs.
Greenow
began
with
one
lover
she
ended
in
company
with
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
Bellfield
,
who
was
sent
on
to
the
house
,
found
Alice
and
Kate
surveying
the
newly
arrived
carpet
bag
.
"
<EOS>
He
knows
"
un
,
"
said
the
boy
who
had
driven
the
gig
,
pointing
to
the
Captain
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
belongs
to
your
old
friend
,
Mr.
Cheesacre
,
"
said
Bellfield
to
Kate
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
has
he
come
too
?
"
said
Kate
.
  
<EOS>
The
Captain
shrugged
his
shoulders
,
and
admitted
that
it
was
hard
.
"
<EOS>
And
it
's
not
the
slightest
use
,
"
said
he
,
"
not
the
least
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
He
never
had
a
chance
in
that
quarter
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Not
enough
of
the
rocks
and
valleys
about
him
,
was
there
,
Captain
Bellfield
?
"
said
Kate
.
<EOS>
But
Captain
Bellfield
understood
nothing
about
the
rocks
and
valleys
,
though
he
was
regarded
by
certain
eyes
as
being
both
a
rock
and
a
valley
himself
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
Cheesacre
was
telling
his
story
.
<EOS>
He
first
asked
,
in
a
melancholy
tone
,
whether
it
was
really
necessary
that
he
must
abandon
all
his
hopes
.
"
<EOS>
He
was
n't
going
to
say
anything
against
the
Captain
,
"
he
said
,
"
if
things
were
really
fixed
.
<EOS>
He
never
begrudged
any
man
his
chance
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Things
are
really
fixed
,
"
said
Mrs.
Greenow
.
  
<EOS>
He
could
,
however
,
not
keep
himself
from
hinting
that
Oileymead
was
a
substantial
home
,
and
that
Bellfield
had
not
as
much
as
a
straw
mattress
to
lie
upon
.
<EOS>
In
answer
to
this
Mrs.
Greenow
told
him
that
there
was
so
much
more
reason
why
some
one
should
provide
the
poor
man
with
a
mattress
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
look
at
it
in
that
light
,
of
course
it
's
true
,
"
said
Cheesacre
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Greenow
told
him
that
she
did
look
at
it
in
that
light
.
"
<EOS>
Then
I
've
done
about
that
,
"
said
Cheesacre
;
"
and
as
to
the
little
bit
of
money
he
owes
me
,
I
must
give
him
his
time
about
it
,
I
suppose
.
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Greenow
assured
him
that
it
should
be
paid
as
soon
as
possible
after
the
nuptial
benediction
had
been
said
over
them
.
<EOS>
She
offered
,
indeed
,
to
pay
it
at
once
if
he
was
in
distress
for
it
,
but
he
answered
contemptuously
that
he
never
was
in
distress
for
money
.
<EOS>
He
liked
to
have
his
own
,
 
<EOS>
that
was
all
.
  
<EOS>
After
this
he
did
not
get
away
to
his
next
subject
quite
so
easily
as
he
wished
;
and
it
must
be
admitted
that
there
was
a
difficulty
.
<EOS>
As
he
could
not
have
Mrs.
Greenow
he
would
be
content
to
put
up
with
Kate
for
his
wife
.
<EOS>
That
was
his
next
subject
.
<EOS>
Rumours
as
to
the
old
Squire
's
will
had
no
doubt
reached
him
,
and
he
was
now
willing
to
take
advantage
of
that
assistance
which
Mrs.
Greenow
had
before
offered
him
in
this
matter
.
<EOS>
The
time
had
come
in
which
he
ought
to
marry
;
of
that
he
was
aware
.
<EOS>
He
had
told
many
of
his
friends
in
Norfolk
that
Kate
Vavasor
had
thrown
herself
at
his
head
,
and
very
probably
he
had
thought
it
true
.
<EOS>
In
answer
to
all
his
love
speeches
to
herself
,
the
aunt
had
always
told
him
what
an
excellent
wife
her
niece
would
make
him
.
<EOS>
So
now
he
had
come
to
Westmoreland
with
this
second
string
to
his
bow
.
<EOS>
"
You
know
you
put
it
into
my
head
your
own
self
,
"
pleaded
Mr.
Cheesacre
.
<EOS>
"
Did
n't
you
,
now
?
"
  
"
But
things
are
so
different
since
that
,
"
said
the
widow
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
different
?
<EOS>
I
ai
n't
different
.
<EOS>
There
's
Oileymead
just
where
it
always
was
,
and
the
owner
of
it
do
n't
owe
a
shilling
to
any
man
.
<EOS>
How
are
things
different
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
niece
has
inherited
property
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
is
that
to
make
a
change
?
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
Mrs.
Greenow
,
who
would
have
thought
to
find
you
mercenary
like
that
?
<EOS>
Inherited
property
!
<EOS>
Is
she
going
to
fling
a
man
over
because
of
that
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Greenow
endeavoured
to
explain
to
him
that
her
niece
could
hardly
be
said
to
have
flung
him
over
,
and
at
last
pretended
to
become
angry
when
he
attempted
to
assert
his
position
.
<EOS>
"
Why
,
Mr.
Cheesacre
,
I
am
quite
sure
she
never
gave
you
a
word
of
encouragement
in
her
life
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
always
told
me
I
might
have
her
for
the
asking
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
now
I
tell
you
that
you
may
n't
.
<EOS>
It
's
of
no
use
your
going
on
there
to
ask
her
,
for
she
will
only
send
you
away
with
an
answer
you
wo
n't
like
.
<EOS>
Look
here
,
Mr.
Cheesacre
;
you
want
to
get
married
,
and
it
's
quite
time
you
should
.
<EOS>
There
's
my
dear
friend
Charlie
Fairstairs
.
<EOS>
How
could
you
get
a
better
wife
than
Charlie
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Charlie
Fairstairs
!
<EOS>
"
said
Cheesacre
,
turning
up
his
nose
in
disgust
.
<EOS>
"
She
has
n't
got
a
penny
,
nor
any
one
belonging
to
her
.
<EOS>
The
man
who
marries
her
will
have
to
find
the
money
for
the
smock
she
stands
up
in
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Who
's
mercenary
now
,
Mr.
Cheesacre
?
<EOS>
Do
you
go
home
and
think
of
it
;
and
if
you
'll
marry
Charlie
,
I
'll
go
to
your
wedding
.
<EOS>
You
sha
n't
be
ashamed
of
her
clothing
.
<EOS>
I
'll
see
to
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
They
were
now
close
to
the
gate
,
and
Cheesacre
paused
before
he
entered
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Do
you
think
there
's
no
chance
at
all
for
me
,
then
?
"
said
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
there
's
none
.
<EOS>
I
've
heard
her
speak
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Somebody
else
,
perhaps
,
is
the
happy
man
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
say
anything
about
that
,
but
I
know
that
she
would
n't
take
you
.
<EOS>
I
like
farming
,
you
know
,
but
she
does
n't
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
might
give
that
up
,
"
said
Cheesacre
readily
,
 
"
at
any
rate
,
for
a
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
no
;
it
would
do
no
good
.
<EOS>
Believe
me
,
my
friend
,
that
it
is
of
no
use
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
still
paused
at
the
gate
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
see
what
's
the
use
of
my
going
in
,
"
said
he
.
<EOS>
To
this
she
made
him
no
answer
.
<EOS>
"
There
's
a
pride
about
me
,
"
he
continued
,
"
that
I
do
n't
choose
to
go
where
I
'm
not
wanted
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
tell
you
,
Mr.
Cheesacre
,
that
you
are
wanted
in
that
light
,
certainly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
I
'll
go
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
you
'll
be
so
good
as
to
tell
the
boy
with
the
gig
to
come
after
me
?
<EOS>
That
's
six
pound
ten
it
will
have
cost
me
to
come
here
and
go
back
.
<EOS>
Bellfield
did
it
cheaper
,
of
course
;
he
travelled
second
class
.
<EOS>
I
heard
of
him
as
I
came
along
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
expense
does
not
matter
to
you
,
Mr.
Cheesacre
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
To
this
he
assented
,
and
then
took
his
leave
,
at
first
offering
his
hand
to
Mrs.
Greenow
with
an
air
of
offended
dignity
,
but
falling
back
almost
into
humility
during
the
performance
of
his
adieu
.
<EOS>
Before
he
was
gone
he
had
invited
her
to
bring
the
Captain
to
Oileymead
when
she
was
married
,
and
had
begged
her
to
tell
Miss
Vavasor
how
happy
he
should
be
to
receive
her
.
"
<EOS>
And
Mr.
Cheesacre
,
"
said
the
widow
,
as
he
walked
back
along
the
road
,
"
do
n't
forget
dear
Charlie
Fairstairs
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
They
were
all
standing
at
the
front
door
of
the
house
when
Mrs.
Greenow
re
-
appeared
,
 
Alice
,
Kate
,
Captain
Bellfield
,
the
Shap
boy
,
and
the
Shap
horse
and
gig
.
<EOS>
"
Where
is
he
?
"
<EOS>
Kate
asked
in
a
low
voice
,
and
everyone
there
felt
how
important
was
the
question
.
"
<EOS>
He
has
gone
,
"
said
the
widow
.
<EOS>
Bellfield
was
so
relieved
that
he
could
not
restrain
his
joy
,
but
took
off
his
little
straw
hat
and
threw
it
up
into
the
air
.
<EOS>
Kate
's
satisfaction
was
almost
as
intense
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
so
glad
,
"
said
she
.
<EOS>
"
What
on
earth
should
we
have
done
with
him
?
"
<EOS>
"
I
never
was
so
disappointed
in
my
life
,
"
said
Alice
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
heard
so
much
of
Mr.
Cheesacre
,
but
have
never
seen
him
.
"
<EOS>
Kate
suggested
that
she
should
get
into
the
gig
and
drive
after
him
.
"
<EOS>
He
ai
n't
a
been
and
took
hisself
off
?
<EOS>
"
suggested
the
boy
,
whose
face
became
very
dismal
as
the
terrible
idea
struck
him
.
<EOS>
But
,
with
juvenile
craft
,
he
put
his
hand
on
the
carpet
-
bag
,
and
finding
that
it
did
not
contain
stones
,
was
comforted
.
<EOS>
"
You
drive
after
him
,
young
gentleman
,
and
you
'll
find
him
on
the
road
to
Shap
,
"
said
Mrs.
Greenow
.
<EOS>
"
Mind
you
give
him
my
love
,
"
said
the
Captain
in
his
glee
,
"
and
say
I
hope
he
'll
get
his
turnips
in
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
little
episode
went
far
to
break
the
day
,
and
did
more
than
anything
else
could
have
done
to
put
Captain
Bellfield
at
his
ease
.
<EOS>
It
created
a
little
joint
-
stock
fund
of
merriment
between
the
whole
party
,
which
was
very
much
needed
.
<EOS>
The
absence
of
such
joint
-
stock
fund
is
always
felt
when
a
small
party
is
thrown
together
without
such
assistance
.
<EOS>
Some
bond
is
necessary
on
these
occasions
,
and
no
other
bond
is
so
easy
or
so
pleasant
.
<EOS>
Now
,
when
the
Captain
found
himself
alone
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
with
Alice
,
he
had
plenty
of
subjects
for
small
-
talk
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
Old
Cheesacre
,
in
spite
of
his
absurdities
,
is
not
a
bad
sort
of
fellow
at
bottom
;
 
awfully
fond
of
his
money
,
you
know
,
Miss
Vavasor
,
and
always
boasting
about
it
.
"
<EOS>
"
That
's
not
pleasant
,
"
said
Alice
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
the
most
unpleasant
thing
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
There
's
nothing
I
hate
so
much
,
Miss
Vavasor
,
as
that
kind
of
talking
.
<EOS>
My
idea
is
this
,
 
when
a
man
has
lots
of
money
,
let
him
make
the
best
use
he
can
of
it
,
and
say
nothing
about
it
.
<EOS>
Nobody
ever
heard
me
talking
about
my
money
.
"
<EOS>
He
knew
that
Alice
knew
that
he
was
a
pauper
;
but
,
nevertheless
,
he
had
the
satisfaction
of
speaking
of
himself
as
though
he
were
not
a
pauper
.
  
<EOS>
In
this
way
the
afternoon
went
very
pleasantly
.
<EOS>
For
an
hour
before
dinner
Captain
Bellfield
was
had
into
the
drawing
-
room
and
was
talked
to
by
his
widow
on
matters
of
business
;
but
he
had
of
course
known
that
this
was
necessary
.
<EOS>
She
scolded
him
soundly
about
those
sheriff
's
officers
.
<EOS>
Why
had
he
not
told
her
?
"
<EOS>
As
long
as
there
's
anything
kept
back
,
I
wo
n't
have
you
,
"
said
she
.
<EOS>
"
I
wo
n't
become
your
wife
till
I
'm
quite
sure
there
's
not
a
penny
owing
that
is
not
shown
in
the
list
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Then
I
think
he
did
tell
her
all
,
 
or
nearly
all
.
<EOS>
When
all
was
counted
it
was
not
so
very
much
.
<EOS>
Three
or
four
hundred
pounds
would
make
him
a
new
man
,
and
what
was
such
a
sum
as
that
to
his
wealthy
widow
!
<EOS>
Indeed
,
for
a
woman
wanting
a
husband
of
that
sort
,
Captain
Bellfield
was
a
safer
venture
than
would
be
a
man
of
a
higher
standing
among
his
creditors
.
<EOS>
It
is
true
Bellfield
might
have
been
a
forger
,
or
a
thief
,
or
a
returned
convict
,
 
but
then
his
debts
could
not
be
large
.
<EOS>
Let
him
have
done
his
best
,
he
could
not
have
obtained
credit
for
a
thousand
pounds
;
whereas
,
no
one
could
tell
the
liabilities
of
a
gentleman
of
high
standing
.
<EOS>
Burgo
Fitzgerald
was
a
gentleman
of
high
standing
,
and
his
creditors
would
have
swallowed
up
every
shilling
that
Mrs.
Greenow
possessed
;
but
with
Captain
Bellfield
she
was
comparatively
safe
.
  
<EOS>
Upon
the
whole
I
think
that
she
was
lucky
in
her
choice
;
or
,
perhaps
,
I
might
more
truly
say
,
that
she
had
chosen
with
prudence
.
<EOS>
He
was
no
forger
,
or
thief
 
in
the
ordinary
sense
of
the
word
;
nor
was
he
a
returned
convict
.
<EOS>
He
was
simply
an
idle
scamp
,
who
had
hung
about
the
world
for
forty
years
,
doing
nothing
,
without
principle
,
shameless
,
accustomed
to
eat
dirty
puddings
,
and
to
be
kicked
 
morally
kicked
 
by
such
men
as
Cheesacre
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
moderate
in
his
greediness
,
and
possessed
of
a
certain
appreciation
of
the
comfort
of
a
daily
dinner
,
which
might
possibly
suffice
to
keep
him
from
straying
very
wide
as
long
as
his
intended
wife
should
be
able
to
keep
the
purse
-
strings
altogether
in
her
own
hands
.
<EOS>
Therefore
,
I
say
that
Mrs.
Greenow
had
been
lucky
in
her
choice
,
and
not
altogether
without
prudence
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
of
taking
this
house
,
"
said
she
,
"
and
of
living
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
,
in
Westmoreland
!
"
said
the
Captain
,
with
something
of
dismay
in
his
tone
.
<EOS>
What
on
earth
would
he
do
with
himself
all
his
life
in
that
gloomy
place
!
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
in
Westmoreland
.
<EOS>
Why
not
in
Westmoreland
as
well
as
anywhere
else
?
<EOS>
If
you
do
n't
like
Westmoreland
,
it
's
not
too
late
yet
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
In
answer
to
this
the
poor
Captain
was
obliged
to
declare
that
he
had
no
objection
whatever
to
Westmoreland
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
've
been
talking
to
my
niece
about
it
,
"
continued
Mrs.
Greenow
,
"
and
I
find
that
such
an
arrangement
can
be
made
very
conveniently
.
<EOS>
The
property
is
left
between
her
and
her
uncle
,
 
the
father
of
my
other
niece
,
and
neither
of
them
want
to
live
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
wo
n't
you
be
rather
dull
,
my
dear
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
could
go
to
Yarmouth
,
you
know
,
in
the
autumn
.
"
<EOS>
Then
the
Captain
's
visage
became
somewhat
bright
again
.
"
<EOS>
And
perhaps
,
if
you
are
not
extravagant
,
we
could
manage
a
month
or
so
in
London
during
the
winter
,
just
to
see
the
plays
and
do
a
little
shopping
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Then
the
Captain
's
face
became
very
bright
.
<EOS>
"
That
will
be
delightful
,
"
said
he
.
"
<EOS>
And
as
for
being
dull
,
"
said
the
widow
,
"
when
people
grow
old
they
must
be
dull
.
<EOS>
Dancing
ca
n't
go
on
for
ever
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
In
answer
to
this
the
widow
's
Captain
assured
the
widow
that
she
was
not
at
all
old
;
and
now
,
on
this
occasion
,
that
ceremony
came
off
successfully
which
had
been
interrupted
on
the
Shap
road
by
the
noise
of
Mr.
Cheesacre
's
wheels
.
<EOS>
"
There
goes
my
cap
,
"
said
she
.
<EOS>
"
What
a
goose
you
are
!
<EOS>
What
will
Jeannette
say
?
"
<EOS>
"
Bother
Jeannette
,
"
said
the
Captain
in
his
bliss
.
<EOS>
"
She
can
do
another
cap
,
and
many
more
wo
n't
be
wanted
.
<EOS>
"
Then
I
think
the
ceremony
was
repeated
.
  
<EOS>
Upon
the
whole
the
Captain
's
visit
was
satisfactory
 
at
any
rate
to
the
Captain
.
<EOS>
Everything
was
settled
.
<EOS>
He
was
to
go
away
on
Saturday
morning
,
and
remain
in
lodgings
at
Penrith
till
the
wedding
,
which
they
agreed
to
have
celebrated
at
Vavasor
Church
.
<EOS>
Kate
promised
to
be
the
solitary
bridesmaid
.
<EOS>
There
was
some
talk
of
sending
for
Charlie
Fairstairs
,
but
the
idea
was
abandoned
.
<EOS>
"
We
'll
have
her
afterwards
,
"
said
the
widow
to
Kate
,
"
when
you
are
gone
,
and
we
shall
want
her
more
.
<EOS>
And
I
'll
get
Cheesacre
here
,
and
make
him
marry
her
.
<EOS>
There
's
no
good
in
paying
for
two
journeys
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
Captain
was
to
be
allowed
to
come
over
from
Penrith
twice
a
week
previous
to
his
marriage
;
or
perhaps
,
I
might
more
fairly
say
,
that
he
was
commanded
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
how
he
felt
when
Mrs.
Greenow
gave
him
his
first
five
-
pound
note
,
and
told
him
that
he
must
make
it
do
for
a
fortnight
?
 
<EOS>
whether
it
was
all
joy
,
or
whether
there
was
about
his
heart
any
touch
of
manly
regret
?
  
<EOS>
"
Captain
Bellfield
,
of
Vavasor
Hall
,
Westmoreland
.
<EOS>
It
do
n't
sound
badly
,
"
he
said
to
himself
,
as
he
travelled
away
on
his
first
journey
to
Penrith
.
   
<EOS>
Lady
Monk
's
Plan
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
night
of
Lady
Monk
's
party
,
Burgo
Fitzgerald
disappeared
;
and
when
the
guests
were
gone
and
the
rooms
were
empty
,
his
aunt
inquired
for
him
in
vain
.
<EOS>
The
old
butler
and
factotum
of
the
house
,
who
was
employed
by
Sir
Cosmo
to
put
out
the
lamps
and
to
see
that
he
was
not
robbed
beyond
a
certain
point
on
these
occasions
of
his
wife
's
triumphs
,
was
interrogated
by
his
mistress
,
and
said
that
he
thought
Mr.
Burgo
had
left
the
house
.
<EOS>
Lady
Monk
herself
knocked
at
her
nephew
's
door
,
when
she
went
up
-
stairs
,
ascending
an
additional
flight
of
stairs
with
her
weary
old
limbs
in
order
that
she
might
do
so
;
she
even
opened
the
door
and
saw
the
careless
debris
of
his
toilet
about
the
room
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
gone
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Perhaps
,
after
all
,
he
has
arranged
it
,
"
she
said
to
herself
,
as
she
went
down
to
her
own
room
.
  
<EOS>
But
Burgo
,
as
we
know
,
had
not
"
arranged
it
.
<EOS>
"
It
may
be
remembered
that
when
Mr.
Palliser
came
back
to
his
wife
in
the
supper
-
room
at
Lady
Monk
's
,
bringing
with
him
the
scarf
which
Lady
Glencora
had
left
up
-
stairs
,
Burgo
was
no
longer
with
her
.
<EOS>
He
had
become
well
aware
that
he
had
no
chance
left
,
at
any
rate
for
that
night
.
<EOS>
The
poor
fool
,
acting
upon
his
aunt
's
implied
advice
rather
than
his
own
hopes
,
had
secured
a
post
-
chaise
,
and
stationed
it
in
Bruton
Street
,
some
five
minutes
"
walk
from
his
aunt
's
house
.
<EOS>
And
he
had
purchased
feminine
wrappings
,
cloaks
,
&
c.
 
things
that
he
thought
might
be
necessary
for
his
companion
.
<EOS>
He
had
,
too
,
ordered
rooms
at
the
new
hotel
near
the
Dover
Station
,
 
the
London
Bridge
Station
,
 
from
whence
was
to
start
on
the
following
morning
a
train
to
catch
the
tidal
boat
for
Boulogne
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
dressing
-
bag
there
for
which
he
had
paid
twenty
-
five
guineas
out
of
his
aunt
's
money
,
not
having
been
able
to
induce
the
tradesman
to
grant
it
to
him
on
credit
;
and
there
were
other
things
,
 
slippers
,
collars
,
stockings
,
handkerchiefs
,
and
what
else
<EOS>
might
,
as
he
thought
,
under
such
circumstances
be
most
necessary
.
<EOS>
Poor
thoughtful
,
thoughtless
fool
!
  
<EOS>
The
butler
was
right
.
<EOS>
He
did
leave
the
house
.
<EOS>
He
saw
Lady
Glencora
taken
to
her
carriage
from
some
back
hiding
-
place
in
the
hall
,
and
then
slipped
out
,
unmindful
of
his
shining
boots
,
and
dress
coat
and
jewelled
studs
.
<EOS>
He
took
a
Gibus
hat
,
 
his
own
,
or
that
of
some
other
unfortunate
,
 
and
slowly
made
his
way
down
to
the
place
in
Bruton
Street
.
<EOS>
There
was
the
carriage
and
pair
of
horses
,
all
in
readiness
;
and
the
driver
,
when
he
had
placed
himself
by
the
door
of
the
vehicle
,
was
not
long
in
emerging
from
the
neighbouring
public
-
house
.
<EOS>
"
All
ready
,
your
honour
,
"
said
the
man
.
<EOS>
"
I
sha
n't
want
you
to
-
night
,
"
said
Burgo
,
hoarsely
;
 
"
go
away
.
"
<EOS>
"
And
about
the
things
,
your
honour
?
"
<EOS>
"
Take
them
to
the
devil
.
<EOS>
No
;
stop
.
<EOS>
Take
them
back
with
you
,
and
ask
somebody
to
keep
them
till
I
send
for
them
.
<EOS>
I
shall
want
them
and
another
carriage
in
a
day
or
two
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Then
he
gave
the
man
half
a
sovereign
,
and
went
away
,
not
looking
at
the
little
treasures
which
he
had
spent
so
much
of
his
money
in
selecting
for
his
love
.
<EOS>
When
he
was
gone
,
the
waterman
and
the
driver
turned
them
over
with
careful
hands
and
gloating
eyes
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
"
eiress
,
I
'll
go
bail
,
"
said
the
waterman
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Pretty
dear
!
<EOS>
I
suppose
her
parints
was
too
many
for
her
,
"
said
the
driver
.
<EOS>
But
neither
of
them
imagined
the
enormity
which
the
hirer
of
the
chaise
had
in
truth
contemplated
.
  
<EOS>
Burgo
from
thence
took
his
way
back
into
Grosvenor
Square
,
and
from
thence
down
Park
Street
,
and
through
a
narrow
passage
and
a
mews
which
there
are
in
those
parts
,
into
Park
Lane
.
<EOS>
He
had
now
passed
the
position
of
Mr.
Palliser
's
house
,
having
come
out
on
Park
Lane
at
a
spot
nearer
to
Piccadilly
;
but
he
retraced
his
steps
,
walking
along
by
the
rails
of
the
Park
,
till
he
found
himself
opposite
to
the
house
.
<EOS>
Then
he
stood
there
,
leaning
back
upon
the
railings
,
and
looking
up
at
Lady
Glencora
's
windows
.
<EOS>
What
did
he
expect
to
see
?
<EOS>
Or
was
he
,
in
truth
,
moved
by
love
of
that
kind
which
can
take
joy
in
watching
the
slightest
shadow
that
is
made
by
the
one
loved
object
,
 
<EOS>
that
may
be
made
by
her
,
or
,
by
some
violent
conjecture
of
the
mind
,
may
be
supposed
to
have
been
so
made
?
<EOS>
Such
love
as
that
is
,
I
think
,
always
innocent
.
<EOS>
Burgo
Fitzgerald
did
not
love
like
that
.
<EOS>
I
almost
doubt
whether
he
can
be
said
to
have
loved
at
all
.
<EOS>
There
was
in
his
breast
a
mixed
,
feverish
desire
,
which
he
took
no
trouble
to
analyse
.
<EOS>
He
wanted
money
.
<EOS>
He
wanted
the
thing
of
which
this
Palliser
had
robbed
him
.
<EOS>
He
wanted
revenge
,
 
though
his
desire
for
that
was
not
a
burning
desire
.
<EOS>
And
among
other
things
,
he
wanted
the
woman
's
beauty
of
the
woman
whom
he
coveted
.
<EOS>
He
wanted
to
kiss
her
again
as
he
had
once
kissed
her
,
and
to
feel
that
she
was
soft
,
and
lovely
,
and
loving
for
him
.
<EOS>
But
as
for
seeing
her
shadow
,
unless
its
movement
indicated
some
purpose
in
his
favour
,
 
I
do
not
think
that
he
cared
much
about
that
.
  
<EOS>
And
why
then
was
he
there
?
<EOS>
Because
in
his
unreasoning
folly
he
did
not
know
what
step
to
take
,
or
what
step
not
to
take
.
<EOS>
There
are
men
whose
energies
hardly
ever
carry
them
beyond
looking
for
the
thing
they
want
.
<EOS>
She
might
see
him
from
the
window
,
and
come
to
him
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
say
that
he
thought
that
it
would
be
so
.
<EOS>
I
fancy
that
he
never
thought
at
all
about
that
or
about
anything
.
<EOS>
If
you
lie
under
a
tree
,
and
open
your
mouth
,
a
plum
may
fall
into
it
.
<EOS>
It
was
probably
an
undefined
idea
of
some
such
chance
as
this
which
brought
him
against
the
railings
in
the
front
of
Mr.
Palliser
's
house
;
that
,
and
a
feeling
made
up
partly
of
despair
and
partly
of
lingering
romance
that
he
was
better
there
,
out
in
the
night
air
,
under
the
gas
-
lamps
,
than
he
could
be
elsewhere
.
<EOS>
There
he
stood
and
looked
,
and
cursed
his
ill
-
luck
.
<EOS>
But
his
curses
had
none
of
the
bitterness
of
those
which
George
Vavasor
was
always
uttering
.
<EOS>
Through
it
all
there
remained
about
Burgo
one
honest
feeling
,
 
one
conviction
that
was
true
,
 
a
feeling
that
it
all
served
him
right
,
and
that
he
had
better
,
perhaps
,
go
to
the
devil
at
once
,
and
give
nobody
any
more
trouble
.
<EOS>
If
he
loved
no
one
sincerely
,
neither
did
he
hate
any
one
;
and
whenever
he
made
any
self
-
inquiry
into
his
own
circumstances
,
he
always
told
himself
that
it
was
all
his
own
fault
.
<EOS>
When
he
cursed
his
fate
,
he
only
did
so
because
cursing
is
so
easy
.
<EOS>
George
Vavasor
would
have
ground
his
victims
up
to
powder
if
he
knew
how
;
but
Burgo
Fitzgerald
desired
to
hurt
no
one
.
  
<EOS>
There
he
stood
till
he
was
cold
,
and
then
,
as
the
plum
did
not
drop
into
his
mouth
,
he
moved
on
.
<EOS>
He
went
up
into
Oxford
Street
,
and
walked
along
it
the
whole
distance
to
the
corner
of
Bond
Street
,
passing
by
Grosvenor
Square
,
to
which
he
intended
to
return
.
<EOS>
At
the
corner
of
Bond
Street
,
a
girl
took
hold
of
him
,
and
looked
up
into
his
face
.
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
"
I
saw
you
once
before
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
you
saw
the
most
miserable
devil
alive
,
"
said
Burgo
.
<EOS>
"
You
ca
n't
be
miserable
,
"
said
the
girl
.
<EOS>
"
What
makes
you
miserable
?
<EOS>
You
've
plenty
of
money
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
had
,
"
said
Burgo
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
plenty
to
eat
and
drink
,
"
exclaimed
the
girl
;
"
and
you
are
so
handsome
!
<EOS>
I
remember
you
.
<EOS>
You
gave
me
supper
one
night
when
I
was
starving
.
<EOS>
I
ai
n't
hungry
now
.
<EOS>
Will
you
give
me
a
kiss
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
'll
give
you
a
shilling
,
and
that
's
better
,
"
said
Burgo
.
<EOS>
"
But
give
me
a
kiss
too
,
"
said
the
girl
.
<EOS>
He
gave
her
first
the
kiss
,
and
then
the
shilling
,
and
after
that
he
left
her
and
passed
on
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
d
 
---
d
if
I
would
n't
change
with
her
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
to
himself
.
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
whether
anything
really
ails
him
?
"
thought
the
girl
.
"
<EOS>
He
said
he
was
wretched
before
.
<EOS>
Should
n't
I
like
to
be
good
to
such
a
one
as
him
!
"
  
<EOS>
Burgo
went
on
,
and
made
his
way
into
the
house
in
Grosvenor
Square
,
by
some
means
probably
unknown
to
his
aunt
,
and
certainly
unknown
to
his
uncle
.
<EOS>
He
emptied
his
pockets
as
he
got
into
bed
,
and
counted
a
roll
of
notes
which
he
had
kept
in
one
of
them
.
<EOS>
There
were
still
a
hundred
and
thirty
pounds
left
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
had
promised
that
she
would
see
him
again
.
<EOS>
She
had
said
as
much
as
that
quite
distinctly
.
<EOS>
But
what
use
would
there
be
in
that
if
all
his
money
should
then
be
gone
?
<EOS>
He
knew
that
the
keeping
of
money
in
his
pocket
was
to
him
quite
an
impossibility
.
<EOS>
Then
he
thought
of
his
aunt
.
<EOS>
What
should
he
say
to
his
aunt
if
he
saw
her
in
the
course
of
the
coming
day
?
<EOS>
Might
it
not
be
as
well
for
him
to
avoid
his
aunt
altogether
?
  
<EOS>
He
breakfasted
up
-
stairs
in
his
bedroom
,
 
in
the
bed
,
indeed
,
eating
a
small
paté
de
foie
gras
from
the
supper
-
table
,
as
he
read
a
French
novel
.
<EOS>
There
he
was
still
reading
his
French
novel
in
bed
when
his
aunt
's
maid
came
to
him
,
saying
that
his
aunt
wished
to
see
him
before
she
went
out
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Tell
me
,
Lucy
,
"
said
he
,
"
how
is
the
old
girl
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
's
as
cross
as
cross
,
Mr.
Burgo
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
I
sha
n't
;
 
not
a
minute
longer
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
,
now
;
will
you
?
<EOS>
I
tell
you
she
's
waiting
for
me
.
"
<EOS>
From
which
it
may
be
seen
that
Lucy
shared
the
general
feminine
feeling
in
favour
of
poor
Burgo
.
  
<EOS>
Thus
summoned
Burgo
applied
himself
to
his
toilet
;
but
as
he
did
so
,
he
recruited
his
energies
from
time
to
time
by
a
few
pages
of
the
French
novel
,
and
also
by
small
doses
from
a
bottle
of
curaçoa
which
he
had
in
his
bedroom
.
<EOS>
He
was
utterly
a
pauper
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
pauper
poorer
than
he
in
London
that
day
.
<EOS>
But
,
nevertheless
,
he
breakfasted
on
paté
de
foie
gras
and
curaçoa
,
and
regarded
those
dainties
very
much
as
other
men
regard
bread
and
cheese
and
beer
.
  
<EOS>
But
though
he
was
dressing
at
the
summons
of
his
aunt
,
he
had
by
no
means
made
up
his
mind
that
he
would
go
to
her
.
<EOS>
Why
should
he
go
to
her
?
<EOS>
What
good
would
it
do
him
?
<EOS>
She
would
not
give
him
more
money
.
<EOS>
She
would
only
scold
him
for
his
misconduct
.
<EOS>
She
might
,
perhaps
,
turn
him
out
of
the
house
if
he
did
not
obey
her
,
 
or
attempt
to
do
so
;
but
she
would
be
much
more
likely
to
do
this
when
he
had
made
her
angry
by
contradicting
her
.
<EOS>
In
neither
case
would
he
leave
the
house
,
even
though
its
further
use
were
positively
forbidden
him
,
because
his
remaining
there
was
convenient
;
but
as
he
could
gain
nothing
by
seeing
"
the
old
girl
,
"
as
he
had
called
her
,
he
resolved
to
escape
to
his
club
without
attending
to
her
summons
.
  
<EOS>
But
his
aunt
,
who
was
a
better
general
than
he
,
out
-
manoeuvred
him
.
<EOS>
He
crept
down
the
back
stairs
;
but
as
he
could
not
quite
condescend
to
escape
through
the
area
,
he
was
forced
to
emerge
upon
the
hall
,
and
here
his
aunt
pounced
upon
him
,
coming
out
of
the
breakfast
-
parlour
.
<EOS>
"
Did
not
Lucy
tell
you
that
I
wanted
to
see
you
?
"
<EOS>
Lady
Monk
asked
,
with
severity
in
her
voice
.
  
<EOS>
Burgo
replied
,
with
perfect
ease
,
that
he
was
going
out
just
to
have
his
hair
washed
and
brushed
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
been
back
in
twenty
minutes
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
energy
about
the
poor
fellow
,
unless
,
perhaps
,
when
he
was
hunting
;
but
he
possessed
a
readiness
which
enabled
him
to
lie
at
a
moment
's
notice
with
the
most
perfect
ease
.
<EOS>
Lady
Monk
did
not
believe
him
;
but
she
could
not
confute
him
,
and
therefore
she
let
the
lie
pass
.
  
<EOS>
"
Never
mind
your
hair
now
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
speak
to
you
.
<EOS>
Come
in
here
for
a
few
minutes
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
As
there
was
no
way
of
escape
left
to
him
,
he
followed
his
aunt
into
the
breakfast
-
parlour
.
  
<EOS>
"
Burgo
,
"
she
said
,
when
she
had
seated
herself
,
and
had
made
him
sit
in
a
chair
opposite
to
her
,
"
I
do
n't
think
you
will
ever
do
any
good
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
much
think
I
shall
,
aunt
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
,
then
,
to
do
with
yourself
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
 
I
do
n't
know
.
<EOS>
I
have
n't
thought
much
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
ca
n't
stay
here
in
this
house
.
<EOS>
Sir
Cosmo
was
speaking
to
me
about
you
only
yesterday
morning
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
quite
willing
to
go
down
to
Monkshade
,
if
Sir
Cosmo
likes
it
better
;
 
that
is
,
when
the
season
is
a
little
more
through
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
wo
n't
have
you
at
Monkshade
.
<EOS>
He
wo
n't
let
you
go
there
again
.
<EOS>
And
he
wo
n't
have
you
here
.
<EOS>
You
know
that
you
are
turning
what
I
say
into
joke
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
indeed
,
aunt
,
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
you
are
;
 
you
know
you
are
.
<EOS>
You
are
the
most
ungrateful
,
heartless
creature
I
ever
met
.
<EOS>
You
must
make
up
your
mind
to
leave
this
house
at
once
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Where
does
Sir
Cosmo
mean
that
I
should
go
,
then
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
To
the
workhouse
,
if
you
like
.
<EOS>
He
does
n't
care
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
suppose
he
does
;
 
the
least
in
the
world
,
"
said
Burgo
,
opening
his
eyes
,
and
stretching
his
nostrils
,
and
looking
into
his
aunt
's
face
as
though
he
had
great
ground
for
indignation
.
  
<EOS>
But
the
turning
of
Burgo
out
of
the
house
was
not
Lady
Monk
's
immediate
purpose
.
<EOS>
She
knew
that
he
would
hang
on
there
till
the
season
was
over
.
<EOS>
After
that
he
must
not
be
allowed
to
return
again
,
unless
he
should
have
succeeded
in
a
certain
enterprise
.
<EOS>
She
had
now
caught
him
in
order
that
she
might
learn
whether
there
was
any
possible
remaining
chance
of
success
as
to
that
enterprise
.
<EOS>
So
she
received
his
indignation
in
silence
,
and
began
upon
another
subject
.
<EOS>
"
What
a
fool
you
made
of
yourself
last
night
,
Burgo
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
I
;
 
more
of
a
fool
than
usual
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
believe
that
you
will
never
be
serious
about
anything
.
<EOS>
Why
did
you
go
on
waltzing
in
that
way
when
every
pair
of
eyes
in
the
room
was
watching
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
could
n't
help
going
on
,
if
she
liked
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
yes
,
 
say
it
was
her
fault
.
<EOS>
That
's
so
like
a
man
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Look
here
,
aunt
,
I
'm
not
going
to
sit
here
and
be
abused
.
<EOS>
I
could
n't
take
her
in
my
arms
,
and
fly
away
with
her
out
of
a
crowd
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Who
wants
you
to
fly
away
with
her
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
For
the
matter
of
that
,
I
suppose
that
you
do
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
do
n't
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
then
,
I
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
You
!
<EOS>
you
have
n't
spirit
to
do
that
,
or
anything
else
.
<EOS>
You
are
like
a
child
that
is
just
able
to
amuse
itself
for
the
moment
,
and
never
can
think
of
anything
further
.
<EOS>
You
simply
disgraced
yourself
last
night
,
and
me
too
,
 
and
her
;
but
,
of
course
,
you
care
nothing
about
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
had
a
plan
all
ready
;
 
only
he
came
back
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
he
came
back
.
<EOS>
Of
course
he
came
back
,
when
they
sent
him
word
how
you
and
she
were
going
on
.
<EOS>
And
now
he
will
have
forgiven
her
,
and
after
that
,
of
course
,
the
thing
will
be
all
over
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
what
,
aunt
;
she
would
go
if
she
knew
how
.
<EOS>
When
I
was
forced
to
leave
her
last
night
,
she
promised
to
see
me
again
.
<EOS>
And
as
for
being
idle
,
and
not
doing
anything
;
 
why
,
I
was
out
in
Park
Lane
last
night
,
after
you
were
in
bed
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
good
did
that
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
did
n't
do
any
good
,
as
it
happened
.
<EOS>
But
a
fellow
can
only
try
.
<EOS>
I
believe
,
after
all
,
it
would
be
easier
down
in
the
country
,
 
especially
now
that
he
has
taken
it
into
his
head
to
look
after
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lady
Monk
sat
silent
for
a
few
moments
,
and
then
she
said
in
a
low
voice
,
"
What
did
she
say
to
you
when
you
were
parting
?
<EOS>
What
were
her
exact
words
?
"
<EOS>
She
,
at
any
rate
,
was
not
deficient
in
energy
.
<EOS>
She
was
anxious
enough
to
see
her
purpose
accomplished
.
<EOS>
She
would
have
conducted
the
matter
with
discretion
,
if
the
running
away
with
Mr.
Palliser
's
wife
could
,
in
very
fact
,
have
been
done
by
herself
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
said
she
would
see
me
again
.
<EOS>
She
promised
it
twice
.
"
  
"
And
was
that
all
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
could
she
say
more
,
when
she
was
forced
to
go
away
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Had
she
said
that
she
would
go
with
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
had
asked
her
,
 
half
a
dozen
times
,
and
she
did
not
once
refuse
.
<EOS>
I
know
she
means
it
,
if
she
knew
how
to
get
away
.
<EOS>
She
hates
him
;
 
I
'm
sure
of
it
.
<EOS>
A
woman
,
you
know
,
would
n't
absolutely
say
that
she
would
go
,
till
she
was
gone
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
she
really
meant
it
,
she
would
tell
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
she
could
have
told
me
plainer
.
<EOS>
She
said
she
would
see
me
again
.
<EOS>
She
said
that
twice
over
.
"
  
<EOS>
Again
Lady
Monk
sat
silent
.
<EOS>
She
had
a
plan
in
her
head
,
 
a
plan
that
might
,
as
she
thought
,
give
to
her
nephew
one
more
chance
.
<EOS>
But
she
hesitated
before
she
could
bring
herself
to
explain
it
in
detail
.
<EOS>
At
first
she
had
lent
a
little
aid
to
this
desired
abduction
of
Mr.
Palliser
's
wife
,
but
in
lending
it
had
said
no
word
upon
the
subject
.
<EOS>
During
the
last
season
she
had
succeeded
in
getting
Lady
Glencora
to
her
house
in
London
,
and
had
taken
care
that
Burgo
should
meet
her
there
.
<EOS>
Then
a
hint
or
two
had
been
spoken
,
and
Lady
Glencora
had
been
asked
to
Monkshade
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
,
as
we
know
,
did
not
go
to
Monkshade
,
and
Lady
Monk
had
then
been
baffled
.
<EOS>
But
she
did
not
therefore
give
up
the
game
.
<EOS>
Having
now
thought
of
it
so
much
,
she
began
to
speak
of
it
more
boldly
,
and
had
procured
money
for
her
nephew
that
he
might
thereby
be
enabled
to
carry
off
the
woman
.
<EOS>
But
though
this
had
been
well
understood
between
them
,
though
words
had
been
spoken
which
were
sufficiently
explicit
,
the
plan
had
not
been
openly
discussed
.
<EOS>
Lady
Monk
had
known
nothing
of
the
mode
in
which
Lady
Glencora
was
to
have
been
carried
off
after
her
party
,
nor
whither
<EOS>
she
was
to
have
been
taken
.
<EOS>
But
now
,
 
now
she
must
arrange
it
herself
,
and
have
a
scheme
of
her
own
,
or
else
<EOS>
the
thing
must
fail
absolutely
.
<EOS>
Even
she
was
almost
reluctant
to
speak
out
plainly
to
her
nephew
on
such
a
subject
.
<EOS>
What
if
he
should
be
false
to
her
,
and
tell
of
her
?
<EOS>
But
when
a
woman
has
made
such
schemes
,
nothing
distresses
her
so
sadly
as
their
failure
.
<EOS>
She
would
risk
all
rather
than
that
Mr.
Palliser
should
keep
his
wife
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
try
and
help
you
,
"
she
said
at
last
,
speaking
hoarsely
,
almost
in
a
whisper
,
"
if
you
have
courage
to
make
an
attempt
yourself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Courage
!
"
said
he
<EOS>
"
What
is
it
<EOS>
you
think
I
am
afraid
of
?
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
?
<EOS>
I
'd
fight
him
,
 
or
all
the
Pallisers
,
one
after
another
,
if
it
would
do
any
good
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Fighting
!
<EOS>
There
's
no
fighting
wanted
,
as
you
know
well
enough
.
<EOS>
Men
do
n't
fight
nowadays
.
<EOS>
Look
here
!
<EOS>
If
you
can
get
her
to
call
here
some
day
,
 
say
on
Thursday
,
at
three
o'clock
,
 
I
will
be
here
to
receive
her
;
and
instead
of
going
back
into
her
carriage
,
you
can
have
a
cab
for
her
somewhere
near
.
<EOS>
She
can
come
,
as
it
were
,
to
make
a
morning
call
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
cab
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
a
cab
wo
n't
kill
her
,
and
it
is
less
easily
followed
than
a
carriage
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
where
shall
we
go
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
a
train
to
Southampton
at
four
,
and
the
boat
sails
for
Jersey
at
half
-
past
six
;
you
will
be
in
Jersey
the
next
morning
,
and
there
is
a
boat
goes
on
to
St.
Malo
,
almost
at
once
.
<EOS>
You
can
go
direct
from
one
boat
to
the
other
,
 
<EOS>
that
is
,
if
she
has
strength
and
courage
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
After
that
,
who
will
say
that
Lady
Monk
was
not
a
devoted
aunt
?
  
<EOS>
"
That
would
do
excellently
well
,
"
said
the
enraptured
Burgo
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
will
have
difficulty
in
getting
away
from
me
,
out
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
Of
course
I
shall
say
nothing
about
it
,
and
shall
know
nothing
about
it
.
<EOS>
She
had
better
tell
her
coachman
to
drive
somewhere
to
pick
some
one
up
,
and
to
return
;
 
out
somewhere
to
Tyburnia
,
or
down
to
Pimlico
.
<EOS>
Then
she
can
leave
me
,
and
go
out
on
foot
,
to
where
you
have
the
cab
.
<EOS>
She
can
tell
the
hall
-
porter
that
she
will
walk
to
her
carriage
.
<EOS>
Do
you
understand
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Burgo
declared
that
he
did
understand
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
call
on
her
,
and
make
your
way
in
,
and
see
her
,
and
arrange
all
this
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
a
Thursday
,
because
of
the
boats
.
<EOS>
"
Then
she
made
inquiry
about
his
money
,
and
took
from
him
the
notes
which
he
had
,
promising
to
return
them
,
with
something
added
,
on
the
Thursday
morning
;
but
he
asked
,
with
a
little
whine
,
for
a
five
-
pound
note
,
and
got
it
.
<EOS>
Burgo
then
told
her
about
the
travelling
-
bags
and
the
stockings
,
and
they
were
quite
pleasant
and
confidential
.
<EOS>
"
Bid
her
come
in
a
stout
travelling
-
dress
,
"
said
Lady
Monk
.
<EOS>
"
She
can
wear
some
lace
or
something
over
it
,
so
that
the
servants
wo
n't
observe
it
.
<EOS>
I
will
take
no
notice
of
it
.
"
<EOS>
Was
there
ever
such
an
aunt
?
  
<EOS>
After
this
,
Burgo
left
his
aunt
,
and
went
away
to
his
club
,
in
a
state
of
most
happy
excitement
.
   
<EOS>
The
Last
Kiss
.
 
<EOS>
Alice
,
on
her
return
from
Westmoreland
,
went
direct
to
Park
Lane
,
whither
Lady
Glencora
and
Mr.
Palliser
had
also
returned
before
her
.
<EOS>
She
was
to
remain
with
them
in
London
one
entire
day
,
and
on
the
morning
after
that
they
were
to
start
for
Paris
.
<EOS>
She
found
Mr.
Palliser
in
close
attendance
upon
his
wife
.
<EOS>
Not
that
there
was
anything
in
his
manner
which
at
all
implied
that
he
was
keeping
watch
over
her
,
or
that
he
was
more
with
her
,
or
closer
to
her
than
a
loving
husband
might
wish
to
be
with
a
young
wife
;
but
the
mode
of
life
was
very
different
from
that
which
Alice
had
seen
at
Matching
Priory
!
  
<EOS>
On
her
arrival
Mr.
Palliser
himself
received
her
in
the
hall
,
and
took
her
up
to
his
wife
before
she
had
taken
off
her
travelling
hat
.
<EOS>
"
We
are
so
much
obliged
to
you
,
Miss
Vavasor
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
feel
it
quite
as
deeply
as
Glencora
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
no
,
"
she
said
;
"
it
is
I
that
am
under
obligation
to
you
for
taking
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
merely
smiled
,
and
shook
his
head
,
and
then
took
her
up
-
stairs
.
<EOS>
On
the
stairs
he
said
one
other
word
to
her
:
"
You
must
forgive
me
if
I
was
cross
to
you
<EOS>
that
night
she
went
out
among
the
ruins
.
<EOS>
"
Alice
muttered
something
,
 
some
little
fib
of
courtesy
as
to
the
matter
having
been
forgotten
,
or
never
borne
in
mind
;
and
then
they
went
on
to
Lady
Glencora
's
room
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
to
Alice
that
he
was
not
so
big
or
so
much
to
be
dreaded
as
when
she
had
seen
him
at
Matching
.
<EOS>
His
descent
from
an
expectant
,
or
more
than
an
expectant
,
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
,
down
to
a
simple
,
attentive
husband
,
seemed
to
affect
his
gait
,
his
voice
,
and
all
his
demeanour
.
<EOS>
When
he
received
Alice
at
the
Priory
he
certainly
loomed
before
her
as
something
great
,
whereas
now
his
greatness
seemed
to
have
fallen
from
him
.
<EOS>
We
must
own
that
this
was
hard
upon
him
,
seeing
that
the
deed
by
which
he
had
divested
himself
of
his
greatness
had
been
so
pure
and
good
!
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
Alice
,
this
is
so
good
of
you
!
<EOS>
I
am
all
in
the
midst
of
packing
,
and
Plantagenet
is
helping
me
.
"
<EOS>
Plantagenet
winced
a
little
under
this
,
as
the
hero
of
old
must
have
winced
when
he
was
found
with
the
distaff
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
had
relinquished
his
sword
of
state
for
the
distaff
which
he
had
assumed
,
and
could
take
no
glory
in
the
change
.
<EOS>
There
was
,
too
,
in
his
wife
's
voice
the
slightest
hint
of
mockery
,
which
,
slight
as
it
was
,
he
perhaps
thought
she
might
have
spared
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
nothing
left
to
pack
,
"
continued
Glencora
,
"
and
I
do
n't
know
what
you
can
do
to
amuse
yourself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
help
you
,
"
said
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
we
have
so
very
nearly
done
.
<EOS>
I
think
we
shall
have
to
pull
all
the
things
out
,
and
put
them
up
again
,
or
we
shall
never
get
through
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
We
could
n't
start
to
-
morrow
;
 
could
we
,
Plantagenet
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
very
well
,
as
your
rooms
are
ordered
in
Paris
for
the
next
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
As
if
we
could
n't
find
rooms
at
every
inn
on
the
road
.
<EOS>
Men
are
so
particular
.
<EOS>
Now
in
travelling
I
should
like
never
to
order
rooms
,
 
never
to
know
where
I
was
going
or
when
I
was
going
,
and
to
carry
everything
I
wanted
in
a
market
-
basket
.
<EOS>
"
Alice
,
who
by
this
time
had
followed
her
friend
along
the
passage
to
her
bedroom
,
and
had
seen
how
widely
the
packages
were
spread
about
,
bethought
herself
that
the
market
-
basket
should
be
a
large
one
.
"
<EOS>
And
I
would
never
travel
among
Christians
.
<EOS>
Christians
are
so
slow
,
and
they
wear
chimney
-
pot
hats
everywhere
.
<EOS>
The
further
one
goes
from
London
among
Christians
,
the
more
they
wear
chimney
-
pot
hats
.
<EOS>
I
want
Plantagenet
to
take
us
to
see
the
Kurds
,
but
he
wo
n't
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
that
would
be
fair
to
Miss
Vavasor
,
"
said
Mr.
Palliser
,
who
had
followed
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
put
the
blame
on
her
head
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
"
Women
have
always
pluck
for
anything
.
<EOS>
Would
n't
you
like
to
see
a
live
Kurd
,
Alice
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
exactly
know
where
they
live
,
"
said
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Nor
I.
I
have
not
the
remotest
idea
of
the
way
to
the
Kurds
.
<EOS>
You
see
my
joke
,
do
n't
you
,
though
Plantagenet
does
n't
?
<EOS>
But
one
knows
that
they
are
Eastern
,
and
the
East
is
such
a
grand
idea
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
we
'll
content
ourselves
with
Rome
,
or
perhaps
Naples
,
on
this
occasion
,
"
said
Mr.
Palliser
.
  
<EOS>
The
notion
of
Lady
Glencora
packing
anything
for
herself
was
as
good
a
joke
as
that
other
one
of
the
Kurds
and
whey
.
<EOS>
But
she
went
flitting
about
from
room
to
room
,
declaring
that
this
thing
must
be
taken
,
and
that
other
,
till
the
market
-
basket
would
have
become
very
large
indeed
.
<EOS>
Alice
was
astonished
at
the
extent
of
the
preparations
,
and
the
sort
of
equipage
with
which
they
were
about
to
travel
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
was
taking
her
own
carriage
.
<EOS>
"
Not
that
I
shall
ever
use
it
,
"
she
said
to
Alice
,
"
but
he
insists
upon
it
,
to
show
that
I
am
not
supposed
to
be
taken
away
in
disgrace
.
<EOS>
He
is
so
good
;
 
is
n't
he
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
good
,
"
said
Alice
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
no
one
better
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
so
dull
!
"
said
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
fancy
that
all
husbands
are
dull
from
the
nature
of
their
position
.
<EOS>
If
I
were
a
young
woman
's
husband
,
I
should
n't
know
what
to
say
to
her
that
was
n't
dull
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Two
women
and
two
men
servants
were
to
be
taken
.
<EOS>
Alice
had
received
permission
to
bring
her
own
maid
 
"
or
a
dozen
,
if
you
want
them
,
"
Lady
Glencora
had
said
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
in
his
present
mood
would
think
nothing
too
much
to
do
for
you
.
<EOS>
If
you
were
to
ask
him
to
go
among
the
Kurds
,
he
'd
go
at
once
;
 
or
on
to
Crim
Tartary
,
if
you
made
a
point
of
it
.
"
<EOS>
But
as
both
Lady
Glencora
's
servants
spoke
French
,
and
as
her
own
did
not
,
Alice
trusted
herself
in
that
respect
to
her
cousin
.
<EOS>
"
You
shall
have
one
all
to
yourself
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
"
I
only
take
two
for
the
same
reason
that
I
take
the
carriage
,
 
just
as
you
let
a
child
go
out
in
her
best
frock
,
for
a
treat
,
after
you
've
scolded
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
When
Alice
asked
why
it
was
supposed
that
Mr.
Palliser
was
so
specially
devoted
to
her
,
the
thing
was
explained
to
her
.
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
my
dear
,
I
have
told
him
everything
.
<EOS>
I
always
do
tell
everything
.
<EOS>
Nobody
can
say
I
am
not
candid
.
<EOS>
He
knows
about
your
not
letting
me
come
to
your
house
in
the
old
days
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
Alice
!
 
<EOS>
you
were
wrong
then
;
I
shall
always
say
that
.
<EOS>
But
it
's
done
and
gone
;
and
things
that
are
done
and
gone
shall
be
done
and
gone
for
me
.
<EOS>
And
I
told
him
all
that
you
said
,
 
about
<EOS>
you
know
what
.
<EOS>
I
have
had
nothing
else
to
do
but
make
confessions
for
the
last
ten
days
,
and
when
a
woman
once
begins
,
the
more
she
confesses
the
better
.
<EOS>
And
I
told
him
that
you
refused
Jeffrey
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
did
n't
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
indeed
,
and
he
likes
you
the
better
for
that
.
<EOS>
I
think
he
'd
let
Jeffrey
marry
you
now
if
you
both
wished
it
;
 
and
then
,
<EOS>
oh
dear
!
 
<EOS>
supposing
that
you
had
a
son
and
that
we
adopted
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Cora
,
if
you
go
on
in
that
way
I
will
not
remain
with
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
must
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
You
ca
n't
escape
now
.
<EOS>
At
any
rate
,
you
ca
n't
when
we
once
get
to
Paris
.
<EOS>
Oh
dear
!
<EOS>
you
should
n't
grudge
me
my
little
naughtinesses
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
so
proper
for
the
last
ten
days
.
<EOS>
Do
you
know
I
got
into
a
way
of
driving
Dandy
and
Flirt
at
the
rate
of
six
miles
an
hour
,
till
I
'm
sure
the
poor
beasts
thought
they
were
always
going
to
a
funeral
.
<EOS>
Poor
Dandy
and
poor
Flirt
!
<EOS>
I
sha
n't
see
them
now
for
another
year
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
On
the
following
morning
they
breakfasted
early
,
because
Mr.
Palliser
had
got
into
an
early
habit
.
<EOS>
He
had
said
that
early
hours
would
be
good
for
them
.
"
<EOS>
But
he
never
tells
me
why
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
is
pleasant
when
people
are
travelling
,
"
said
Alice
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
n't
that
,
"
her
cousin
answered
;
"
but
we
are
all
to
be
such
particularly
good
children
.
<EOS>
It
's
hardly
fair
,
because
he
went
to
sleep
last
night
after
dinner
while
you
and
I
kept
ourselves
awake
:
but
we
need
n't
do
that
another
night
,
to
be
sure
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
After
breakfast
they
all
three
went
to
work
to
do
nothing
.
<EOS>
It
was
ludicrous
and
almost
painful
to
see
Mr.
Palliser
wandering
about
and
counting
the
boxes
,
as
though
he
could
do
any
good
by
that
.
<EOS>
At
this
special
crisis
of
his
life
he
hated
his
papers
and
figures
and
statistics
,
and
could
not
apply
himself
to
them
.
<EOS>
He
,
whose
application
had
been
so
unremitting
,
could
apply
himself
now
to
nothing
.
<EOS>
His
world
had
been
brought
to
an
abrupt
end
,
and
he
was
awkward
at
making
a
new
beginning
.
<EOS>
I
believe
that
they
all
three
were
reading
novels
before
one
o'clock
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
and
Alice
had
determined
that
they
would
not
leave
the
house
throughout
the
day
.
<EOS>
"
Nothing
has
been
said
about
it
,
but
I
regard
it
as
part
of
the
bond
that
I
'm
not
to
go
out
anywhere
.
<EOS>
Who
knows
but
what
I
might
be
found
in
Gloucester
Square
?
<EOS>
"
There
was
,
however
,
no
absolute
necessity
that
Mr.
Palliser
should
remain
with
them
;
and
,
at
about
three
,
he
prepared
himself
for
a
solitary
walk
.
<EOS>
He
would
not
go
down
to
the
House
.
<EOS>
All
interest
in
the
House
was
over
with
him
for
the
present
.
<EOS>
He
had
the
Speaker
's
leave
to
absent
himself
for
the
season
.
<EOS>
Nor
would
he
call
on
anyone
.
<EOS>
All
his
friends
knew
,
or
believed
they
knew
,
that
he
had
left
town
.
<EOS>
His
death
and
burial
had
been
already
chronicled
,
and
were
he
now
to
reappear
,
he
could
reappear
only
as
a
ghost
.
<EOS>
He
was
being
talked
of
as
the
departed
one
;
 
or
rather
,
such
talk
on
all
sides
had
now
come
nearly
to
an
end
.
<EOS>
The
poor
Duke
of
St.
Bungay
still
thought
of
him
with
regret
when
more
than
ordinarily
annoyed
by
some
special
grievance
coming
to
him
from
Mr.
Finespun
;
but
even
the
Duke
had
become
almost
reconciled
to
the
present
order
of
things
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
knew
better
than
to
disturb
all
this
by
showing
himself
again
in
public
;
and
prepared
himself
,
therefore
,
to
take
another
walk
under
the
elms
in
Kensington
Gardens
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
his
hat
on
his
head
in
the
hall
,
and
was
in
the
act
of
putting
on
his
gloves
,
when
there
came
a
knock
at
the
front
door
.
<EOS>
The
hall
-
porter
was
there
,
a
stout
,
plethoric
personage
,
not
given
to
many
words
,
who
was
at
this
moment
standing
with
his
master
's
umbrella
in
his
hand
,
looking
as
though
he
would
fain
be
of
some
use
to
somebody
,
if
any
such
utility
were
compatible
with
the
purposes
of
his
existence
.
<EOS>
Now
had
come
this
knock
at
the
door
,
while
the
umbrella
was
still
in
his
hand
,
and
the
nature
of
his
visage
changed
,
and
it
was
easy
to
see
that
he
was
oppressed
by
the
temporary
multiplicity
of
his
duties
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Give
me
the
umbrella
,
John
,
"
said
Mr.
Palliser
.
<EOS>
John
gave
up
the
umbrella
,
and
opening
the
door
disclosed
Burgo
Fitzgerald
standing
upon
the
door
-
step
.
"
<EOS>
Is
Lady
Glencora
at
home
?
"
asked
Burgo
,
before
he
had
seen
the
husband
.
<EOS>
John
turned
a
dismayed
face
upon
his
master
,
as
though
he
knew
that
the
comer
ought
not
to
be
making
a
morning
call
at
that
house
,
 
as
no
doubt
he
did
know
very
well
,
 
and
made
no
instant
reply
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
sure
,
"
said
Mr.
Palliser
,
making
his
way
out
as
he
had
originally
purposed
.
<EOS>
"
The
servant
will
find
out
for
you
.
"
<EOS>
Then
he
went
on
his
way
across
Park
Lane
and
into
the
Park
,
never
once
turning
back
his
face
to
see
whether
Burgo
had
effected
an
entrance
into
the
house
.
<EOS>
Nor
did
he
return
a
minute
earlier
than
he
would
otherwise
have
done
.
<EOS>
After
all
,
there
was
something
chivalrous
about
the
man
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
Lady
Glencora
was
at
home
,
"
said
the
porter
,
not
stirring
to
make
any
further
inquiry
.
<EOS>
It
was
no
business
of
his
if
Mr.
Palliser
chose
to
receive
such
a
guest
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
been
desired
to
say
that
her
ladyship
was
not
at
home
.
<EOS>
Burgo
was
therefore
admitted
and
shown
direct
up
into
the
room
in
which
Lady
Glencora
was
sitting
.
<EOS>
As
chance
would
have
it
,
she
was
alone
.
<EOS>
Alice
had
left
her
and
was
in
her
own
chamber
,
and
Lady
Glencora
was
sitting
at
the
window
of
the
small
room
up
-
stairs
that
overlooked
the
Park
.
<EOS>
She
was
seated
on
a
footstool
with
her
face
between
her
hands
when
Burgo
was
admitted
,
thinking
of
him
,
and
of
what
the
world
might
have
been
to
her
had
"
they
left
her
alone
,
"
as
she
was
in
the
habit
of
saying
to
Alice
and
to
herself
.
  
<EOS>
She
rose
quickly
,
so
that
he
saw
her
only
as
she
was
rising
.
"
<EOS>
Ask
Miss
Vavasor
to
come
to
me
,
"
she
said
,
as
the
servant
left
the
room
;
and
then
she
came
forward
to
greet
her
lover
.
  
<EOS>
"
Cora
,
"
he
said
,
dashing
at
once
into
his
subject
 
hopelessly
,
but
still
with
a
resolve
to
do
as
he
had
said
that
he
would
do
.
"
<EOS>
Cora
,
I
have
come
to
you
,
to
ask
you
to
go
with
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
go
with
you
,
"
said
she
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
not
answer
me
in
that
way
,
without
a
moment
's
thought
.
<EOS>
Everything
is
arranged
 
"
  
"
Yes
,
everything
is
arranged
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Fitzgerald
,
let
me
ask
you
to
leave
me
alone
,
and
to
behave
to
me
with
generosity
.
<EOS>
Everything
is
arranged
.
<EOS>
You
can
see
that
my
boxes
are
all
prepared
for
going
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
and
I
,
and
my
friend
,
are
starting
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
Wish
me
God
-
speed
and
go
,
and
be
generous
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
is
this
to
be
the
end
of
everything
?
"
<EOS>
He
was
standing
close
to
her
,
but
hitherto
he
had
only
touched
her
hand
at
greeting
her
.
"
<EOS>
Give
me
your
hand
,
Cora
,
"
he
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
 
I
will
never
give
you
my
hand
again
.
<EOS>
You
should
be
generous
to
me
and
go
.
<EOS>
This
is
to
be
the
end
of
everything
,
 
of
everything
that
is
common
to
you
and
to
me
.
<EOS>
Go
,
when
I
ask
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Cora
;
did
you
ever
love
me
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
I
did
love
you
.
<EOS>
But
we
were
separated
,
and
there
was
no
room
for
love
left
between
us
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
as
dear
to
me
now
,
 
dearer
than
ever
you
were
.
<EOS>
Do
not
look
at
me
like
that
.
<EOS>
Did
you
not
tell
me
when
we
last
parted
that
I
might
come
to
you
again
?
<EOS>
Are
we
children
,
that
others
should
come
between
us
and
separate
us
like
that
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Burgo
;
we
are
children
.
<EOS>
Here
is
my
cousin
coming
.
<EOS>
You
must
leave
me
now
.
<EOS>
"
As
she
spoke
the
door
was
opened
and
Alice
entered
the
room
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Miss
Vavasor
,
Mr.
Fitzgerald
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
told
him
to
go
and
leave
me
.
<EOS>
Now
that
you
have
come
,
Alice
,
he
will
perhaps
obey
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Alice
was
dumbfounded
,
and
knew
not
how
to
speak
either
to
him
or
to
her
;
but
she
stood
with
her
eyes
riveted
on
the
face
of
the
man
of
whom
she
had
heard
so
much
.
<EOS>
Yes
;
certainly
he
was
very
beautiful
.
<EOS>
She
had
never
before
seen
man
's
beauty
such
as
that
.
<EOS>
She
found
it
quite
impossible
to
speak
a
word
to
him
then
 
at
the
spur
of
the
moment
,
but
she
acknowledged
the
introduction
with
a
slight
inclination
of
the
head
,
and
then
stood
silent
,
as
though
she
were
waiting
for
him
to
go
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Fitzgerald
,
why
do
you
not
leave
me
and
go
?
"
said
Lady
Glencora
.
  
<EOS>
Poor
Burgo
also
found
it
difficult
enough
to
speak
.
<EOS>
What
could
he
say
?
<EOS>
His
cause
was
one
which
certainly
did
not
admit
of
being
pleaded
in
the
presence
of
a
strange
lady
;
and
he
might
have
known
from
the
moment
in
which
he
heard
Glencora
's
request
that
a
third
person
should
be
summoned
to
their
meeting
 
and
probably
did
know
,
that
there
was
no
longer
any
hope
for
him
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
on
the
cards
that
he
should
win
.
<EOS>
But
there
remained
one
thing
that
he
must
do
.
<EOS>
He
must
get
himself
out
of
that
room
;
and
how
was
he
to
effect
that
?
  
<EOS>
"
I
had
hoped
,
"
said
he
,
looking
at
Alice
,
though
he
addressed
Lady
Glencora
 
<EOS>
"
I
had
hoped
to
be
allowed
to
speak
to
you
alone
for
a
few
minutes
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
Mr.
Fitzgerald
;
it
can
not
be
so
.
<EOS>
Alice
do
not
go
.
<EOS>
I
sent
for
my
cousin
when
I
saw
you
,
because
I
did
not
choose
to
be
alone
with
you
.
<EOS>
I
have
asked
you
to
go
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
You
perhaps
have
not
understood
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
understand
you
well
enough
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
,
Mr.
Fitzgerald
,
"
said
Alice
,
"
why
do
you
not
do
as
Lady
Glencora
has
asked
you
?
<EOS>
You
know
 
<EOS>
you
must
know
,
that
you
ought
not
to
be
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
nothing
of
the
kind
,
"
said
he
,
still
standing
his
ground
.
  
<EOS>
"
Alice
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
,
"
we
will
leave
Mr.
Fitzgerald
here
,
since
he
drives
us
from
the
room
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
In
such
contests
,
a
woman
has
ever
the
best
of
it
at
all
points
.
<EOS>
The
man
plays
with
a
button
to
his
foil
,
while
the
woman
uses
a
weapon
that
can
really
wound
.
<EOS>
Burgo
knew
that
he
must
go
,
 
<EOS>
felt
that
he
must
skulk
away
as
best
he
might
,
and
perhaps
hear
a
low
titter
of
half
-
suppressed
laughter
as
he
went
.
<EOS>
Even
that
might
be
possible
.
"
<EOS>
No
,
Lady
Glencora
,
"
he
said
,
"
I
will
not
drive
you
from
the
room
.
<EOS>
As
one
must
be
driven
out
,
it
shall
be
I.
<EOS>
I
own
<EOS>
I
did
think
that
you
would
at
any
rate
have
been
 
less
hard
to
me
.
"
<EOS>
He
then
turned
to
go
,
bowing
again
very
slightly
to
Miss
Vavasor
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
on
the
threshold
of
the
door
before
Glencora
's
voice
recalled
him
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
my
God
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
"
I
am
hard
,
 
harder
than
flint
.
<EOS>
I
am
cruel
.
<EOS>
Burgo
!
"
<EOS>
And
he
was
back
with
her
in
a
moment
,
and
had
taken
her
by
the
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
Glencora
,
"
said
Alice
,
"
pray
,
 
<EOS>
pray
let
him
go
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Fitzgerald
,
if
you
are
a
man
,
do
not
take
advantage
of
her
folly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
speak
to
him
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
speak
to
him
,
and
then
he
shall
leave
me
.
<EOS>
"
She
was
holding
him
by
the
hand
now
and
turning
to
him
,
away
from
Alice
,
who
had
taken
her
by
the
arm
.
<EOS>
"
Burgo
,
"
she
said
,
repeating
his
name
twice
again
,
with
all
the
passion
that
she
could
throw
into
the
word
,
 
"
Burgo
,
no
good
can
come
of
this
.
<EOS>
Now
,
you
must
leave
me
.
<EOS>
You
must
go
.
<EOS>
I
shall
stay
with
my
husband
as
I
am
bound
to
do
.
<EOS>
Because
I
have
wronged
you
,
I
will
not
wrong
him
also
.
<EOS>
I
loved
you
;
 
you
know
I
loved
you
.
"
<EOS>
She
still
held
him
by
the
hand
,
and
was
now
gazing
up
into
his
face
,
while
the
tears
were
streaming
from
her
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
said
Alice
,
"
you
have
heard
from
her
all
that
you
can
care
to
hear
.
<EOS>
If
you
have
any
feeling
of
honour
in
you
,
you
will
leave
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
never
leave
her
,
while
she
tells
me
that
she
loves
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Burgo
,
you
will
;
 
you
must
!
<EOS>
I
shall
never
tell
you
that
again
,
never
.
<EOS>
Do
as
she
bids
you
.
<EOS>
Go
,
and
leave
us
;
 
<EOS>
but
I
could
not
bear
that
you
should
tell
me
that
I
was
hard
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
hard
;
 
hard
and
cruel
,
as
you
said
,
yourself
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Am
I
?
<EOS>
May
God
forgive
you
for
saying
that
of
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
why
do
you
send
me
away
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Because
I
am
a
man
's
wife
,
and
because
I
care
for
his
honour
,
if
not
for
my
own
.
<EOS>
Alice
,
let
us
go
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
still
held
her
,
but
she
would
have
been
gone
from
him
had
he
not
stooped
over
her
,
and
put
his
arm
round
her
waist
.
<EOS>
In
doing
this
,
I
doubt
whether
he
was
quicker
<EOS>
than
she
would
have
been
had
she
chosen
to
resist
him
.
<EOS>
As
it
was
,
he
pressed
her
to
his
bosom
,
and
,
stooping
over
her
,
kissed
her
lips
.
<EOS>
Then
he
left
her
,
and
making
his
way
out
of
the
room
,
and
down
the
stairs
,
got
himself
out
into
the
street
.
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
God
,
that
he
is
gone
!
"
said
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
may
say
so
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
,
"
for
you
have
lost
nothing
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
have
gained
everything
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Have
I
?
<EOS>
I
did
not
know
that
I
had
ever
gained
anything
,
as
yet
.
<EOS>
The
only
human
being
to
whom
I
have
ever
yet
given
my
whole
heart
,
 
the
only
thing
that
I
have
ever
really
loved
,
has
just
gone
from
me
for
ever
,
and
you
bid
me
thank
God
that
I
have
lost
him
.
<EOS>
There
is
no
room
for
thankfulness
in
any
of
it
;
 
either
in
the
love
or
in
the
loss
.
<EOS>
It
is
all
wretchedness
from
first
to
last
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
At
any
rate
,
he
understands
now
that
you
meant
it
when
you
told
him
to
leave
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
I
meant
it
.
<EOS>
I
am
beginning
to
know
myself
by
degrees
.
<EOS>
As
for
running
away
with
him
,
I
have
not
the
courage
to
do
it
.
<EOS>
I
can
think
of
it
,
scheme
for
it
,
wish
for
it
;
 
but
as
for
doing
it
,
that
is
beyond
me
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
is
quite
safe
.
<EOS>
He
need
not
try
to
coax
me
to
remain
.
"
  
<EOS>
Alice
knew
that
it
was
useless
to
argue
with
her
,
so
she
came
and
sat
over
her
,
 
for
Lady
Glencora
had
again
placed
herself
on
the
stool
by
the
window
,
 
and
tried
to
sooth
her
by
smoothing
her
hair
,
and
nursing
her
like
a
child
.
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
I
know
that
I
ought
to
stay
where
I
am
,
"
she
said
,
breaking
out
,
almost
with
rage
,
and
speaking
with
quick
,
eager
voice
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
such
a
fool
as
to
mistake
what
I
should
be
if
I
left
my
husband
,
and
went
to
live
with
that
man
as
his
mistress
.
<EOS>
You
do
n't
suppose
that
I
should
think
that
sort
of
life
very
blessed
.
<EOS>
But
why
have
I
been
brought
to
such
a
pass
as
this
?
<EOS>
And
,
as
for
female
purity
!
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
What
was
their
idea
of
purity
when
they
forced
me
,
like
ogres
,
to
marry
a
man
for
whom
they
knew
I
never
cared
?
<EOS>
Had
I
gone
with
him
,
 
had
I
now
eloped
with
that
man
who
ought
to
have
been
my
husband
,
 
whom
would
a
just
God
have
punished
worst
,
 
me
,
or
those
two
old
women
and
my
uncle
,
who
tortured
me
into
this
marriage
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Come
,
Cora
,
 
be
silent
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wo
n't
be
silent
!
<EOS>
You
have
had
the
making
of
your
own
lot
.
<EOS>
You
have
done
what
you
liked
,
and
no
one
has
interfered
with
you
.
<EOS>
You
have
suffered
,
too
;
but
you
,
at
any
rate
,
can
respect
yourself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
so
can
you
,
Cora
,
 
thoroughly
,
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
;
 
when
he
kissed
me
,
and
I
could
hardly
restrain
myself
from
giving
him
back
his
kiss
tenfold
,
could
I
respect
myself
?
<EOS>
But
it
is
all
sin
.
<EOS>
I
sin
towards
my
husband
,
feigning
that
I
love
him
;
and
I
sin
in
loving
that
other
man
,
who
should
have
been
my
husband
.
<EOS>
There
;
 
I
hear
Mr.
Palliser
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
Come
away
with
me
;
or
rather
,
stay
,
for
he
will
come
up
here
,
and
you
can
keep
him
in
talk
while
I
try
to
recover
myself
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
did
at
once
as
his
wife
had
said
,
and
came
up
-
stairs
to
the
little
front
room
,
as
soon
as
he
had
deposited
his
hat
in
the
hall
.
<EOS>
Alice
was
,
in
fact
,
in
doubt
what
she
should
do
,
as
to
mentioning
,
or
omitting
to
mention
,
Mr.
Fitzgerald
's
name
.
<EOS>
In
an
ordinary
way
,
it
would
be
natural
that
she
should
name
any
visitor
who
had
called
,
and
she
specially
disliked
the
idea
of
remaining
silent
because
that
visitor
had
come
as
the
lover
of
her
host
's
wife
.
<EOS>
But
,
on
the
other
hand
,
she
owed
much
to
Lady
Glencora
;
and
there
was
no
imperative
reason
,
as
things
had
gone
,
why
she
should
make
mischief
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
further
danger
to
be
apprehended
.
<EOS>
But
Mr.
Palliser
at
once
put
an
end
to
her
doubts
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
had
a
visitor
here
?
"
said
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
saw
him
as
I
went
out
,
"
said
Mr.
Palliser
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Indeed
,
I
met
him
at
the
hall
door
.
<EOS>
He
,
of
course
,
was
wrong
to
come
here
;
 
so
wrong
,
that
he
deserves
punishment
,
if
there
were
any
punishment
for
such
offences
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
He
has
been
punished
,
I
think
,
"
said
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
as
for
Glencora
,
"
continued
Mr.
Palliser
,
without
any
apparent
notice
of
what
Alice
had
said
,
"
I
thought
it
better
that
she
should
see
him
or
not
,
as
she
should
herself
decide
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
had
no
choice
in
the
matter
.
<EOS>
As
it
turned
out
,
he
was
shown
up
here
at
once
.
<EOS>
She
sent
for
me
,
and
I
think
she
was
right
to
do
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Glencora
was
alone
when
he
came
in
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
For
a
minute
or
two
,
 
till
I
could
get
to
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
questions
to
ask
about
it
,
"
said
Mr.
Palliser
,
after
waiting
for
a
few
moments
.
<EOS>
He
had
probably
thought
that
Alice
would
say
something
further
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
glad
that
you
were
within
reach
of
her
,
as
otherwise
her
position
might
have
been
painful
.
<EOS>
For
her
,
and
for
me
perhaps
,
it
may
be
as
well
that
he
has
been
here
.
<EOS>
As
for
him
,
I
can
only
say
,
that
I
am
forced
to
suppose
him
to
be
a
villain
.
<EOS>
What
a
man
does
when
driven
by
passion
,
I
can
forgive
;
but
that
he
should
deliberately
plan
schemes
to
ruin
both
her
and
me
,
is
what
I
can
hardly
understand
.
"
<EOS>
As
he
made
this
little
speech
I
wonder
whether
his
conscience
said
anything
to
him
about
Lady
Dumbello
,
and
a
certain
evening
in
his
own
life
,
on
which
he
had
ventured
to
call
that
lady
,
Griselda
.
  
<EOS>
The
little
party
of
three
dined
together
very
quietly
,
and
after
dinner
they
all
went
to
work
with
their
novels
.
<EOS>
Before
long
Alice
saw
that
Mr.
Palliser
was
yawning
,
and
she
began
to
understand
how
much
he
had
given
up
in
order
that
his
wife
might
be
secure
.
<EOS>
It
was
then
,
when
he
had
left
the
room
for
a
few
minutes
,
in
order
that
he
might
wake
himself
by
walking
about
the
house
,
that
Glencora
told
Alice
of
his
yawning
down
at
Matching
.
<EOS>
"
I
used
to
think
that
he
would
fall
in
pieces
.
<EOS>
What
are
we
to
do
about
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
seem
to
notice
it
,
"
said
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
all
very
well
,
"
said
the
other
;
"
but
he
'll
set
us
off
yawning
as
bad
as
himself
,
and
then
he
'll
notice
it
.
<EOS>
He
has
given
himself
up
to
politics
,
till
nothing
else
has
any
salt
in
it
left
for
him
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
think
why
such
a
man
as
that
wanted
a
wife
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
very
hard
upon
him
,
Cora
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
you
were
his
wife
,
with
all
my
heart
.
<EOS>
But
,
of
course
,
I
know
why
he
got
married
.
<EOS>
And
I
ought
to
feel
for
him
as
he
has
been
so
grievously
disappointed
.
"
<EOS>
Then
Mr.
Palliser
having
walked
off
his
sleep
,
returned
to
the
room
,
and
the
remainder
of
the
evening
was
passed
in
absolute
tranquillity
.
  
<EOS>
Burgo
Fitzgerald
,
when
he
left
the
house
,
turned
back
into
Grosvenor
Square
,
not
knowing
,
at
first
,
whither
he
was
going
.
<EOS>
He
took
himself
as
far
as
his
uncle
's
door
,
and
then
,
having
paused
there
for
a
moment
,
hurried
on
.
<EOS>
For
half
an
hour
,
or
thereabouts
,
something
like
true
feeling
was
at
work
within
his
heart
.
<EOS>
He
had
once
more
pressed
to
his
bosom
the
woman
he
had
,
at
any
rate
,
thought
that
he
had
loved
.
<EOS>
He
had
had
his
arm
round
her
,
and
had
kissed
her
,
and
the
tone
with
which
she
had
called
him
by
his
name
was
still
ringing
in
his
ears
,
"
Burgo
!
"
<EOS>
He
repeated
his
own
name
audibly
to
himself
,
as
though
in
this
way
he
could
recall
her
voice
.
<EOS>
He
comforted
himself
for
a
minute
with
the
conviction
that
she
loved
him
.
<EOS>
He
felt
,
 
for
a
moment
,
 
that
he
could
live
on
such
consolation
as
that
!
<EOS>
But
among
mortals
there
could
,
in
truth
,
hardly
be
one
with
whom
such
consolation
would
go
a
shorter
way
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
man
who
required
to
have
such
comfort
backed
by
patés
and
curaçoa
to
a
very
large
extent
,
and
now
it
might
be
doubted
whether
the
amount
of
patés
and
curaçoa
at
his
command
would
last
him
much
longer
.
  
<EOS>
He
would
not
go
in
and
tell
his
aunt
at
once
of
his
failure
,
as
he
could
gain
nothing
by
doing
so
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
he
thought
that
he
would
not
tell
his
aunt
at
all
.
<EOS>
So
he
turned
back
from
Grosvenor
Square
,
and
went
down
to
his
club
in
St.
James
's
Street
,
feeling
that
billiards
and
brandy
-
and
-
water
might
,
for
the
present
,
be
the
best
restorative
.
<EOS>
But
,
as
he
went
back
,
he
blamed
himself
very
greatly
in
the
matter
of
those
bank
-
notes
which
he
had
allowed
Lady
Monk
to
take
from
him
.
<EOS>
How
had
it
come
to
pass
that
he
had
been
such
a
dupe
in
her
hands
?
<EOS>
When
he
entered
his
club
in
St.
James
's
Street
his
mind
had
left
Lady
Glencora
,
and
was
hard
at
work
considering
how
he
might
best
contrive
to
get
that
spoil
out
of
his
aunt
's
possession
.
   
<EOS>
From
London
to
Baden
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
following
morning
everybody
was
stirring
by
times
at
Mr.
Palliser
's
house
in
Park
Lane
,
and
the
master
of
that
house
yawned
no
more
.
<EOS>
There
is
some
life
in
starting
for
a
long
journey
,
and
the
life
is
the
stronger
and
the
fuller
if
the
things
and
people
to
be
carried
are
numerous
and
troublesome
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
was
a
little
troublesome
,
and
would
not
come
down
to
breakfast
in
time
.
<EOS>
When
rebuked
on
account
of
this
manifest
breach
of
engagement
,
she
asserted
that
the
next
train
would
do
just
as
well
;
and
when
Mr.
Palliser
proved
to
her
,
with
much
trouble
,
that
the
next
train
could
not
enable
them
to
reach
Paris
on
that
day
,
she
declared
that
it
would
be
much
more
comfortable
to
take
a
week
in
going
than
to
hurry
over
the
ground
in
one
day
.
<EOS>
There
was
nothing
she
wanted
so
much
as
to
see
Folkestone
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
that
is
the
case
,
why
did
not
you
tell
me
so
before
?
"
said
Mr.
Palliser
,
in
his
gravest
voice
.
"
<EOS>
Richard
and
the
carriage
went
down
yesterday
,
and
are
already
on
board
the
packet
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
If
Richard
and
the
carriage
are
already
on
board
the
packet
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
,
"
of
course
we
must
follow
them
,
and
we
must
put
off
the
glories
of
Folkestone
till
we
come
back
.
<EOS>
Alice
,
have
n't
you
observed
that
,
in
travelling
,
you
are
always
driven
on
by
some
Richard
or
some
carriage
,
till
you
feel
that
you
are
a
slave
?
"
  
<EOS>
All
this
was
trying
to
Mr.
Palliser
;
but
I
think
that
he
enjoyed
it
,
nevertheless
,
and
that
he
was
happy
when
he
found
that
he
did
get
his
freight
off
from
the
Pimlico
Station
in
the
proper
train
.
  
<EOS>
Of
course
Lady
Glencora
and
Alice
were
very
ill
crossing
the
Channel
;
of
course
the
two
maids
were
worse
than
their
mistresses
;
of
course
the
men
kept
out
of
their
master
's
way
when
they
were
wanted
,
and
drank
brandy
-
and
-
water
with
the
steward
down
-
stairs
;
and
of
course
Lady
Glencora
declared
that
she
would
not
allow
herself
to
be
carried
beyond
Boulogne
that
day
;
 
but
,
nevertheless
,
they
did
get
on
to
Paris
.
<EOS>
Had
Mr.
Palliser
become
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
,
as
he
had
once
hoped
,
he
could
hardly
have
worked
harder
than
he
did
work
.
<EOS>
It
was
he
who
found
out
which
carriage
had
been
taken
for
them
,
and
who
put
,
with
his
own
hands
,
the
ladies
"
dressing
-
cases
and
cloaks
on
to
the
seats
,
 
who
laid
out
the
novels
,
which
,
of
course
,
were
not
read
by
the
road
,
 
and
made
preparations
as
though
this
stage
of
their
journey
was
to
take
them
a
week
,
instead
of
five
hours
and
a
half
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
dear
!
<EOS>
how
I
have
slept
!
"
said
Lady
Glencora
,
as
they
came
near
to
Paris
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
've
been
tolerably
comfortable
,
"
said
Mr.
Palliser
,
joyfully
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Since
we
got
out
of
that
horrid
boat
I
have
done
pretty
well
.
<EOS>
Why
do
they
make
the
boats
so
nasty
?
<EOS>
I
'm
sure
they
do
it
on
purpose
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
difficult
to
make
them
nice
,
I
suppose
?
"
said
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
the
sea
that
makes
them
uncomfortable
,
"
said
Mr.
Palliser
.
  
<EOS>
"
Never
mind
;
we
sha
n't
have
any
more
of
it
for
twelve
months
,
at
any
rate
.
<EOS>
We
can
get
to
the
Kurds
,
Alice
,
without
getting
into
a
packet
again
.
<EOS>
That
,
to
my
way
of
thinking
,
is
the
great
comfort
of
the
Continent
.
<EOS>
One
can
go
everywhere
without
being
seasick
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
said
nothing
,
but
he
sighed
as
he
thought
of
being
absent
for
a
whole
year
.
<EOS>
He
had
said
that
such
was
his
intention
,
and
would
not
at
once
go
back
from
what
he
himself
had
said
.
<EOS>
But
how
was
he
to
live
for
twelve
months
out
of
the
House
of
Commons
?
<EOS>
What
was
he
to
do
with
himself
,
with
his
intellect
and
his
energy
,
during
all
these
coming
dreary
days
?
<EOS>
And
then
,
 
he
might
have
been
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
!
<EOS>
He
might
even
now
,
at
this
very
moment
,
have
been
upon
his
legs
,
making
a
financial
statement
of
six
hours
"
duration
,
to
the
delight
of
one
-
half
of
the
House
,
and
bewilderment
of
the
other
,
instead
of
dragging
cloaks
across
that
dingy
,
dull
,
dirty
waiting
-
room
at
the
Paris
Station
,
in
which
British
subjects
are
kept
in
prison
while
their
boxes
are
being
tumbled
out
of
the
carriages
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
we
are
not
to
stop
here
;
 
are
we
?
"
said
Lady
Glencora
,
mournfully
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
dear
;
 
I
have
given
the
keys
to
Richard
.
<EOS>
We
will
go
on
at
once
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
ca
n't
we
have
our
things
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
In
about
half
an
hour
,
"
pleaded
Mr.
Palliser
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
we
must
bear
it
,
Alice
?
"
said
Lady
Glencora
as
she
got
into
the
carriage
that
was
waiting
for
her
.
  
<EOS>
Alice
thought
of
the
last
time
in
which
she
had
been
in
that
room
,
 
when
George
and
Kate
had
been
with
her
,
 
and
the
two
girls
had
been
quite
content
to
wait
patiently
while
their
trunks
were
being
examined
.
<EOS>
But
Alice
was
now
travelling
with
great
people
,
 
with
people
who
never
spoke
of
their
wealth
,
or
seemed
ever
to
think
of
it
,
but
who
showed
their
consciousness
of
it
at
every
turn
of
their
lives
.
<EOS>
"
After
all
,
"
Alice
had
said
to
herself
more
than
once
,
"
I
doubt
whether
the
burden
is
not
greater
than
the
pleasure
.
"
  
<EOS>
They
stayed
in
Paris
for
a
week
,
and
during
that
time
Alice
found
that
she
became
very
intimate
with
Mr.
Palliser
.
<EOS>
At
Matching
she
had
,
in
truth
,
seen
but
little
of
him
,
and
had
known
nothing
.
<EOS>
Now
she
began
to
understand
his
character
,
and
learned
how
to
talk
to
him
,
She
allowed
him
to
tell
her
of
things
in
which
Lady
Glencora
resolutely
persisted
in
taking
no
interest
.
<EOS>
She
delighted
him
by
writing
down
in
a
little
pocket
-
book
the
number
of
eggs
that
were
consumed
in
Paris
every
day
,
whereas
Glencora
protested
that
the
information
was
worth
nothing
unless
her
husband
could
tell
her
how
many
of
the
eggs
were
good
,
and
how
many
bad
.
<EOS>
And
Alice
was
glad
to
find
that
a
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
female
operatives
were
employed
in
Paris
,
while
Lady
Glencora
said
it
was
a
great
shame
,
and
that
they
ought
all
to
have
husbands
.
<EOS>
When
Mr.
Palliser
explained
that
that
was
impossible
,
because
of
the
redundancy
of
the
female
population
,
she
angered
him
very
much
by
asserting
that
she
saw
a
great
many
men
walking
about
who
,
she
was
quite
sure
,
had
not
wives
of
their
own
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
so
wish
you
had
married
him
!
"
<EOS>
Glencora
said
to
Alice
that
evening
.
<EOS>
"
You
would
always
have
had
a
pocket
-
book
ready
to
write
down
the
figures
,
and
you
would
have
pretended
to
care
about
the
eggs
,
and
the
bottles
of
wine
,
and
the
rest
of
it
.
<EOS>
As
for
me
,
I
ca
n't
do
it
.
<EOS>
If
I
see
an
hungry
woman
,
I
can
give
her
my
money
;
or
if
she
be
a
sick
woman
,
I
can
nurse
her
;
or
if
I
hear
of
a
very
wicked
man
,
I
can
hate
him
;
 
but
<EOS>
I
can
not
take
up
poverty
and
crime
in
the
lump
.
<EOS>
I
never
believe
it
all
.
<EOS>
My
mind
is
n't
big
enough
.
"
  
<EOS>
They
went
into
no
society
at
Paris
,
and
at
the
end
of
a
week
were
all
glad
to
leave
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
that
Baden
will
be
any
better
,
"
Lady
Glencora
said
;
"
but
,
you
know
,
we
can
leave
that
again
after
a
bit
,
 
and
<EOS>
so
we
shall
go
on
getting
nearer
to
the
Kurds
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
To
this
,
Mr.
Palliser
demurred
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
we
had
better
make
up
our
mind
to
stay
a
month
at
Baden
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
why
should
we
make
up
our
minds
at
all
?
"
<EOS>
his
wife
pleaded
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
like
to
have
a
plan
,
"
said
Mr.
Palliser
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
so
do
I
,
"
said
his
wife
,
 
"
if
only
for
the
sake
of
not
keeping
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
nothing
I
hate
so
much
as
not
carrying
out
my
intentions
,
"
said
Mr.
Palliser
.
  
<EOS>
Upon
this
,
Lady
Glencora
shrugged
her
shoulders
,
and
made
a
mock
grimace
to
her
cousin
.
<EOS>
All
this
her
husband
bore
for
a
while
meekly
,
and
it
must
be
acknowledged
that
he
behaved
very
well
.
<EOS>
But
,
then
,
he
had
his
own
way
in
everything
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
did
not
behave
very
well
,
 
contradicting
her
husband
,
and
not
considering
,
as
,
perhaps
<EOS>
,
she
ought
to
have
done
,
the
sacrifice
he
was
making
on
her
behalf
.
<EOS>
But
,
then
,
she
had
her
own
way
in
nothing
.
  
<EOS>
She
had
her
own
way
in
almost
nothing
;
but
on
one
point
she
did
conquer
her
husband
.
<EOS>
He
was
minded
to
go
from
Paris
back
to
Cologne
,
and
so
down
the
Rhine
to
Baden
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
declared
that
she
hated
the
Rhine
,
 
that
,
of
all
rivers
,
it
was
the
most
distasteful
to
her
;
that
,
of
all
scenery
,
the
scenery
of
the
Rhine
was
the
most
over
-
praised
;
and
that
she
would
be
wretched
all
the
time
if
she
were
carried
that
way
.
<EOS>
Upon
this
,
Mr.
Palliser
referred
the
matter
to
Alice
;
and
she
,
who
had
last
been
upon
the
Rhine
with
her
cousins
Kate
and
George
Vavasor
,
voted
for
going
to
Baden
by
way
of
Strasbourg
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
will
go
by
Strasbourg
,
then
,
"
said
Mr.
Palliser
,
gallantly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
that
I
want
to
see
that
horrid
church
again
,
"
said
Glencora
.
  
<EOS>
"
Everything
is
alike
horrid
to
you
,
I
think
,
"
said
her
husband
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
determined
not
to
be
contented
,
so
that
it
matters
very
little
which
way
we
go
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
the
truth
,
"
said
his
wife
.
<EOS>
"
It
does
matter
very
little
.
"
  
<EOS>
They
got
on
to
Baden
,
 
with
very
little
delay
at
Strasbourg
,
and
found
half
an
hotel
prepared
for
their
reception
.
<EOS>
Here
the
carriage
was
brought
into
use
for
the
first
time
,
and
the
mistress
of
the
carriage
talked
of
sending
home
for
Dandy
and
Flirt
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
,
when
he
heard
the
proposition
,
calmly
assured
his
wife
that
the
horses
would
not
bear
the
journey
.
<EOS>
"
They
would
be
so
out
of
condition
,
"
he
said
,
"
as
not
to
be
worth
anything
for
two
or
three
months
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
only
meant
to
ask
for
them
if
they
could
come
in
a
balloon
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
.
  
<EOS>
This
angered
Mr.
Palliser
,
who
had
really
,
for
a
few
minutes
,
thought
of
pacifying
his
wife
by
sending
for
the
horses
.
  
<EOS>
"
Alice
,
"
she
asked
,
one
morning
,
"
how
many
eggs
are
eaten
in
Baden
every
morning
before
ten
o'clock
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
,
who
at
the
moment
was
in
the
act
of
eating
one
,
threw
down
his
spoon
,
and
pushed
his
plate
from
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
matter
,
Plantagenet
?
"
she
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
matter
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
But
never
mind
;
I
am
a
fool
to
care
for
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
declare
I
did
n't
know
that
I
had
done
anything
wrong
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Alice
,
do
you
understand
what
it
is
?
"
  
<EOS>
Alice
said
that
she
did
understand
very
well
.
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
she
understands
,
"
said
Mr.
Palliser
.
<EOS>
"
How
can
she
help
it
?
<EOS>
And
,
indeed
,
Miss
Vavasor
,
I
am
more
unhappy
than
I
can
express
myself
,
to
think
that
your
comfort
should
be
disturbed
in
this
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
word
I
think
Alice
is
doing
very
well
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
"
What
is
there
to
hurt
her
comfort
?
<EOS>
Nobody
scolds
her
.
<EOS>
Nobody
tells
her
that
she
is
a
fool
.
<EOS>
She
never
jokes
,
or
does
anything
wicked
,
and
,
of
course
,
she
is
n't
punished
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
,
as
he
wandered
that
day
alone
through
the
gambling
-
rooms
at
the
great
Assembly
House
,
thought
that
,
after
all
,
it
might
have
been
better
for
him
to
have
remained
in
London
,
to
have
become
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
,
and
to
have
run
all
risks
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
whether
it
would
be
any
harm
if
I
were
to
put
a
few
pieces
of
money
on
the
table
,
just
once
?
"
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
said
to
her
cousin
,
on
the
evening
of
the
same
day
,
in
one
of
those
gambling
salons
.
<EOS>
There
had
been
some
music
on
that
evening
in
one
side
of
the
building
,
and
the
Pallisers
had
gone
to
the
rooms
.
<EOS>
But
as
neither
of
the
two
ladies
would
dance
,
they
had
strayed
away
into
the
other
apartments
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
greatest
harm
in
the
world
!
"
said
Alice
;
"
and
what
on
earth
could
you
gain
by
it
?
<EOS>
You
do
n't
really
want
any
of
those
horrid
people
's
money
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
tell
you
what
I
want
,
 
something
to
live
for
,
 
some
excitement
.
<EOS>
Is
it
not
a
shame
that
I
see
around
me
<EOS>
so
many
people
getting
amusement
,
and
that
I
can
get
none
?
<EOS>
I
'd
go
and
sit
out
there
,
and
drink
beer
and
hear
the
music
,
only
Plantagenet
would
n't
let
me
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
'll
throw
one
piece
on
to
the
table
to
see
what
becomes
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
leave
you
if
you
do
,
"
said
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
such
a
prude
!
<EOS>
It
seems
to
me
as
if
it
must
have
been
my
special
fate
,
 
my
good
fate
,
I
mean
,
 
that
has
thrown
me
so
much
with
you
.
<EOS>
You
look
after
me
quite
as
carefully
as
Mr.
Bott
and
Mrs.
Marsham
ever
did
;
but
as
I
chose
you
myself
,
I
ca
n't
very
well
complain
,
and
I
ca
n't
very
well
get
rid
of
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
want
to
get
rid
of
me
,
Cora
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Sometimes
.
<EOS>
Do
you
know
,
there
are
moments
when
I
almost
make
up
my
mind
to
go
headlong
to
the
devil
,
 
when
I
think
it
is
the
best
thing
to
be
done
.
<EOS>
It
's
a
hard
thing
for
a
woman
to
do
,
because
she
has
to
undergo
so
much
obloquy
before
she
gets
used
to
it
.
<EOS>
A
man
can
take
to
drinking
,
and
gambling
and
all
the
rest
of
it
,
and
nobody
despises
him
a
bit
.
<EOS>
The
domestic
old
fogies
give
him
lectures
if
they
can
catch
him
,
but
he
is
n't
fool
enough
for
that
.
<EOS>
All
he
wants
is
money
,
and
he
goes
away
and
has
his
fling
.
<EOS>
Now
I
have
plenty
of
money
,
 
or
,
at
any
rate
,
I
had
,
 
<EOS>
and
I
never
got
my
fling
yet
.
<EOS>
I
do
feel
so
tempted
to
rebel
,
and
go
ahead
,
and
care
for
nothing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Throwing
one
piece
on
to
the
table
would
n't
satisfy
that
longing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
think
I
should
be
like
the
wild
beast
that
has
tasted
blood
,
and
ca
n't
be
controlled
.
<EOS>
Look
at
all
these
people
here
.
<EOS>
There
are
husbands
gambling
,
and
their
wives
do
n't
know
it
;
and
wives
gambling
,
and
their
husbands
do
n't
know
it
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
whether
Plantagenet
ever
has
a
fling
?
<EOS>
What
a
joke
it
would
be
to
come
and
catch
him
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
you
need
be
afraid
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Afraid
!
<EOS>
I
should
like
him
all
the
better
for
it
.
<EOS>
If
he
came
to
me
,
some
morning
,
and
told
me
that
he
had
lost
a
hundred
thousand
pounds
,
I
should
be
so
much
more
at
my
ease
with
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
no
chance
in
that
direction
,
I
'm
quite
sure
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
None
the
least
.
<EOS>
He
'd
make
a
calculation
that
the
chances
were
nine
to
seven
against
him
,
and
then
the
speculation
would
seem
to
him
to
be
madness
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
suppose
he
'd
wish
to
try
,
even
though
he
were
sure
of
winning
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
not
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
a
very
vulgar
kind
of
thing
then
.
<EOS>
Look
,
 
there
's
an
opening
there
.
<EOS>
I
'll
just
put
on
one
napoleon

"
  
<EOS>
"
You
shall
not
.
<EOS>
If
you
do
,
I
'll
leave
you
at
once

<EOS>
Look
at
the
women
who
are
playing
.
<EOS>
Is
there
one
there
whom
it
would
not
disgrace
you
to
touch
?
<EOS>
Look
what
they
are
.
<EOS>
Look
at
their
cheeks
,
and
their
eyes
,
and
their
hands
.
<EOS>
Those
men
who
rake
about
the
money
are
bad
enough
,
but
the
women
look
like
fiends
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
're
not
going
to
frighten
me
in
that
hobgoblin
sort
of
way
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
see
anything
the
matter
with
any
of
the
people
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
think
of
that
young
woman
who
has
just
got
a
handful
of
money
from
the
man
next
to
her
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
she
is
very
happy
.
<EOS>
I
never
get
money
given
to
me
by
handfuls
,
and
the
man
to
whom
I
belong
gives
me
no
encouragement
when
I
want
to
amuse
myself
.
<EOS>
"
They
were
now
standing
near
to
one
end
of
the
table
,
and
suddenly
there
came
to
be
an
opening
through
the
crowd
up
to
the
table
itself
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
,
leaving
Alice
's
side
,
at
once
stepped
up
and
deposited
a
piece
of
gold
on
one
of
the
marked
compartments
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
she
placed
it
she
retreated
again
with
flushed
face
,
and
took
hold
of
Alice
's
arm
.
<EOS>
"
There
,
"
she
said
,
"
I
have
done
it
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Alice
,
in
her
dismay
,
did
not
know
what
step
to
take
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
scold
her
friend
now
,
as
the
eyes
of
many
were
turned
upon
them
,
nor
could
she
,
of
course
,
leave
her
,
as
she
had
threatened
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
laughed
with
her
peculiar
little
low
laughter
,
and
stood
her
ground
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
determined
you
should
n't
frighten
me
out
of
it
,
"
she
said
.
  
<EOS>
One
of
the
ministers
at
the
table
had
in
the
meantime
gone
on
with
the
cards
,
and
had
called
the
game
;
and
another
minister
had
gently
pushed
three
or
four
more
pieces
of
gold
up
to
that
which
Lady
Glencora
had
flung
down
,
and
had
then
cunningly
caught
her
eye
,
and
,
with
all
the
courtesy
of
which
he
was
master
,
had
pushed
them
further
on
towards
her
.
<EOS>
She
had
supposed
herself
to
be
unknown
there
in
the
salon
,
but
no
doubt
all
the
croupiers
and
half
the
company
knew
well
enough
who
was
the
new
customer
at
the
table
.
<EOS>
There
was
still
the
space
open
,
near
to
which
she
stood
,
and
then
someone
motioned
to
her
to
come
and
take
up
the
money
which
she
had
won
.
<EOS>
She
hesitated
,
and
then
the
croupier
asked
her
,
in
that
low
,
indifferent
voice
which
these
men
always
use
,
whether
she
desired
that
her
money
should
remain
.
<EOS>
She
nodded
her
head
to
him
,
and
he
at
once
drew
the
money
back
again
to
the
spot
on
which
she
had
placed
the
first
napoleon
.
<EOS>
Again
the
cards
were
turned
up
softly
,
again
the
game
was
called
,
and
again
she
won
.
<EOS>
The
money
was
dealt
out
to
her
,
 
on
this
occasion
with
a
full
hand
.
<EOS>
There
were
lying
there
between
twenty
and
thirty
napoleons
,
of
which
she
was
the
mistress
.
<EOS>
Her
face
had
flushed
before
,
but
now
it
became
very
red
.
<EOS>
She
caught
hold
of
Alice
,
who
was
literally
trembling
beside
her
,
and
tried
to
laugh
again
.
<EOS>
But
there
was
that
in
her
eye
which
told
Alice
that
she
was
really
frightened
.
<EOS>
Some
one
then
placed
a
chair
for
her
at
the
table
,
and
in
her
confusion
,
not
knowing
what
she
was
to
do
,
she
seated
herself
.
<EOS>
"
Come
away
,
"
said
Alice
,
taking
hold
of
her
,
and
disregarding
everything
<EOS>
but
her
own
purpose
,
in
the
agony
of
the
moment
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
come
away
!
<EOS>
You
shall
not
sit
there
!
"
<EOS>
"
I
must
get
rid
of
that
money
,
"
said
Glencora
,
trying
to
whisper
her
words
,
"
<EOS>
and
then
I
will
come
away
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
croupier
again
asked
her
if
the
money
was
to
remain
,
and
she
again
nodded
her
head
.
<EOS>
Everybody
at
the
table
was
now
looking
at
her
.
<EOS>
The
women
especially
were
staring
at
her
,
 
those
horrid
women
with
vermilion
cheeks
,
and
loud
bonnets
half
off
their
heads
,
and
hard
,
shameless
eyes
,
and
white
gloves
,
which
,
when
taken
off
in
the
ardour
of
the
game
,
disclosed
dirty
hands
.
<EOS>
They
stared
at
her
with
that
fixed
stare
which
such
women
have
,
and
Alice
saw
it
all
,
and
trembled
.
  
<EOS>
Again
she
won
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Leave
it
,
"
said
Alice
,
"
and
come
away
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
leave
it
,
"
said
Glencora
.
<EOS>
"
If
I
do
,
there
'll
be
a
fuss
.
<EOS>
I
'll
go
the
next
time
.
<EOS>
"
What
she
said
was
,
of
course
,
in
English
,
and
was
probably
understood
by
no
one
near
her
;
but
it
was
easy
to
be
seen
that
she
was
troubled
,
and
,
of
course
,
those
around
her
looked
at
her
the
more
because
of
her
trouble
.
<EOS>
Again
that
little
question
and
answer
went
on
between
her
and
the
croupier
,
and
on
this
occasion
the
money
was
piled
up
on
the
compartment
 
a
heap
of
gold
which
made
envious
the
hearts
of
many
who
stood
around
there
.
<EOS>
Alice
had
now
both
her
hands
on
the
back
of
the
chair
,
needing
support
.
<EOS>
If
the
devil
should
persist
,
and
increase
that
stock
of
gold
again
,
she
must
go
and
seek
for
Mr.
Palliser
.
<EOS>
She
knew
not
what
else
to
do
.
<EOS>
She
understood
nothing
of
the
table
,
or
of
its
laws
;
but
she
supposed
all
those
ministers
of
the
game
to
be
thieves
,
and
believed
that
all
villainous
contrivances
were
within
their
capacity
.
<EOS>
She
thought
that
they
might
go
on
adding
to
that
heap
so
long
as
Lady
Glencora
would
sit
there
,
presuming
that
they
might
thus
get
her
into
their
clutches
.
<EOS>
Of
course
,
she
did
not
sift
her
suspicions
.
<EOS>
Who
does
at
such
moments
?
<EOS>
"
Come
away
at
once
,
and
leave
it
,
"
she
said
,
"
or
I
shall
go
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
At
that
moment
the
croupier
raked
it
all
up
,
and
carried
it
all
away
;
but
Alice
did
not
see
that
this
had
been
done
.
<EOS>
A
hand
had
been
placed
on
her
shoulder
,
and
as
she
turned
round
her
face
her
eyes
met
those
of
Mr.
Palliser
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
all
gone
,
"
said
Glencora
,
laughing
.
<EOS>
And
now
she
,
turning
round
,
also
saw
her
husband
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
so
glad
that
you
are
come
,
"
said
Alice
.
<EOS>
"
Why
did
you
bring
her
here
?
"
said
Mr.
Palliser
.
<EOS>
There
was
anger
in
his
tone
,
and
anger
in
his
eye
.
<EOS>
He
took
his
wife
's
arm
upon
his
own
,
and
walked
away
quickly
,
while
Alice
followed
them
alone
.
<EOS>
He
went
off
at
once
,
down
the
front
steps
of
the
building
,
towards
the
hotel
.
<EOS>
What
he
said
to
his
wife
,
Alice
did
not
hear
;
but
her
heart
was
swelling
with
the
ill
-
usage
to
which
she
herself
was
subjected
.
<EOS>
Though
she
might
have
to
go
back
alone
to
England
,
she
would
tell
him
that
he
was
ill
-
treating
her
.
<EOS>
She
followed
him
on
,
up
into
their
drawing
-
room
,
and
there
he
stood
with
the
door
open
in
his
hand
for
her
,
while
Lady
Glencora
threw
herself
upon
a
sofa
,
and
burst
out
into
affected
laughter
.
<EOS>
"
Here
's
a
piece
of
work
,
"
she
said
,
"
about
a
little
accident
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
An
accident
!
"
said
Mr.
Palliser
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
an
accident
.
<EOS>
You
do
n't
suppose
that
I
sat
down
there
meaning
to
win
all
that
money
?
"
<EOS>
Whereupon
he
looked
at
her
with
scorn
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Palliser
,
"
said
Alice
,
"
you
have
treated
me
this
evening
in
a
manner
I
did
not
expect
from
you
.
<EOS>
It
is
clear
that
you
blame
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
said
a
word
,
Miss
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
you
have
not
said
a
word
.
<EOS>
You
know
well
how
to
show
your
anger
without
speaking
.
<EOS>
As
I
do
not
choose
to
undergo
your
displeasure
,
I
will
return
to
England
by
myself
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
Alice
!
<EOS>
Alice
!
<EOS>
"
said
Glencora
,
jumping
up
,
"
that
is
nonsense
!
<EOS>
What
is
all
this
trumpery
thing
about
?
<EOS>
Leave
me
,
because
he
chooses
to
be
angry
about
nothing
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
it
nothing
that
I
find
my
wife
playing
at
a
common
gambling
-
table
,
surrounded
by
all
that
is
wretched
and
vile
,
 
established
there
,
seated
,
with
heaps
of
gold
before
her
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
wrong
me
,
Plantagenet
,
"
said
Glencora
.
<EOS>
"
There
was
only
one
heap
,
and
that
did
not
remain
long
.
<EOS>
Did
it
,
Alice
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
impossible
to
make
you
ashamed
of
anything
,
"
he
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
certainly
do
n't
like
being
ashamed
,
"
she
answered
;
"
and
do
n't
feel
any
necessity
on
this
occasion
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
do
n't
object
,
Mr.
Palliser
,
"
said
Alice
,
"
I
will
go
to
bed
.
<EOS>
You
can
think
over
all
this
at
night
,
 
and
so
can
I.
<EOS>
Good
night
,
Glencora
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Then
Alice
took
her
candle
,
and
marched
off
to
her
own
room
,
with
all
the
dignity
of
which
she
was
mistress
.
   
<EOS>
From
Baden
to
Lucerne
.
 
<EOS>
The
second
week
in
July
saw
Mr.
Palliser
's
party
,
carriage
and
all
,
established
at
Lucerne
,
in
Switzerland
,
safe
beyond
the
reach
of
the
German
gambling
tables
.
<EOS>
Alice
Vavasor
was
still
with
them
;
and
the
reader
will
therefore
understand
that
that
quarrel
about
Lady
Glencora
's
wickedness
had
been
settled
without
any
rupture
.
<EOS>
It
had
been
settled
amicably
,
and
by
the
time
that
they
had
reached
Lucerne
,
Alice
was
inclined
to
acknowledge
that
the
whole
thing
was
not
worth
notice
;
but
for
many
days
her
anger
against
Mr.
Palliser
had
not
been
removed
,
and
her
intimacy
with
him
had
been
much
checked
.
<EOS>
It
was
now
a
month
since
the
occurrence
of
that
little
scene
in
the
salon
at
Baden
,
which
was
described
in
the
last
chapter
,
 
since
Mr.
Palliser
had
marched
off
with
his
wife
,
leaving
Alice
to
follow
as
she
best
could
by
herself
.
<EOS>
After
that
,
as
the
reader
may
remember
,
he
had
almost
told
her
that
she
was
to
be
blamed
because
of
his
wife
's
indiscretion
;
and
when
she
had
declared
her
intention
of
leaving
him
,
and
making
her
way
home
to
England
by
herself
,
he
had
answered
her
not
at
all
,
and
had
allowed
her
to
go
off
to
her
own
room
under
the
full
ban
of
his
displeasure
.
<EOS>
Since
that
he
had
made
no
apology
to
her
;
he
had
not
,
in
so
many
words
,
acknowledged
that
he
had
wronged
her
;
but
Alice
had
become
aware
that
he
intended
to
apologize
by
his
conduct
,
and
she
had
been
content
so
far
to
indulge
his
obstinacy
as
to
accept
this
conduct
on
his
part
in
lieu
of
any
outspoken
petition
for
pardon
.
<EOS>
The
acknowledgement
of
a
mistake
and
the
asking
for
grace
is
almost
too
much
for
any
woman
to
expect
from
such
a
man
as
Mr.
Palliser
.
  
<EOS>
Early
on
the
morning
after
the
scene
in
question
,
Lady
Glencora
had
gone
into
Alice
's
bedroom
,
and
had
found
her
cousin
in
her
dressing
-
gown
,
packing
up
her
things
,
or
looking
as
though
she
intended
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
not
such
a
fool
,
"
she
said
,
"
as
to
think
anything
of
what
occurred
yesterday
?
<EOS>
"
Alice
assured
her
that
,
whether
fool
or
not
,
she
did
think
a
great
deal
of
it
.
"
<EOS>
In
point
of
fact
,
"
said
Alice
,
"
I
ca
n't
stand
it
.
<EOS>
He
expects
me
to
take
care
of
you
,
and
chooses
to
show
himself
offended
if
you
do
n't
do
just
what
he
thinks
proper
;
whereas
,
as
you
know
well
enough
,
I
have
not
the
slightest
influence
over
you
.
<EOS>
"
All
these
positions
Lady
Glencora
contradicted
vigorously
.
<EOS>
Of
course
,
Mr.
Palliser
had
been
wrong
in
walking
out
of
the
Assembly
Rooms
as
he
had
done
,
leaving
Alice
behind
him
.
<EOS>
So
much
Lady
Glencora
admitted
.
<EOS>
But
this
had
come
of
his
intense
anxiety
.
"
<EOS>
And
you
know
what
a
man
he
is
,
"
said
his
wife
 
<EOS>
"
how
stiff
,
and
hard
,
and
unpleasant
he
can
be
without
meaning
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
There
is
no
reason
why
I
should
bear
his
unpleasantness
,
"
said
Alice
.
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
there
is
,
 
great
reason
.
<EOS>
You
are
to
do
it
for
the
sake
of
friendship
.
<EOS>
And
as
for
my
not
doing
what
you
tell
me
,
you
know
that
's
not
true
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
I
not
beg
you
to
keep
away
from
the
table
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
you
did
,
and
of
course
I
was
naughty
;
but
that
was
only
once
.
<EOS>
Alice
,
I
want
you
more
than
I
ever
wanted
you
before
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
tell
you
more
now
,
but
you
must
stay
with
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Alice
consented
to
come
down
to
breakfast
without
any
immediate
continuance
of
her
active
preparations
for
going
,
and
at
last
,
of
course
,
she
stayed
.
<EOS>
When
she
entered
the
breakfast
-
room
Mr.
Palliser
came
up
to
her
,
and
offered
her
his
hand
.
<EOS>
She
had
no
alternative
but
to
take
it
,
and
then
seated
herself
.
<EOS>
That
there
was
an
intended
apology
in
the
manner
in
which
he
offered
her
toast
and
butter
,
she
was
convinced
;
and
the
special
courtesy
with
which
he
handed
her
to
the
carriage
,
when
she
and
Lady
Glencora
went
out
for
their
drive
,
after
dinner
,
was
almost
as
good
as
a
petition
for
pardon
.
<EOS>
So
the
thing
went
on
,
and
by
degrees
Mr.
Palliser
and
Miss
Vavasor
were
again
friends
.
  
<EOS>
But
Alice
never
knew
in
what
way
the
matter
was
settled
between
Mr.
Palliser
and
his
wife
,
or
whether
there
was
any
such
settling
.
<EOS>
Probably
there
was
none
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Of
course
,
he
understands
that
it
did
n't
mean
anything
,
"
Lady
Glencora
had
said
.
<EOS>
"
He
knows
that
I
do
n't
want
to
gamble
.
"
<EOS>
But
let
that
be
as
it
might
,
their
sojourn
at
Baden
was
curtailed
,
and
none
of
the
party
went
up
again
to
the
Assembly
Rooms
before
their
departure
.
  
<EOS>
Before
establishing
themselves
at
Lucerne
they
made
a
little
tour
round
by
the
Falls
of
the
Rhine
and
Zurich
.
<EOS>
In
their
preparations
for
this
journey
,
Alice
made
a
struggle
,
but
a
struggle
in
vain
,
to
avoid
a
passage
through
Basle
.
<EOS>
It
was
only
too
clear
to
her
that
Mr.
Palliser
was
determined
to
go
by
Basle
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
bring
herself
to
say
that
she
had
recollections
connected
with
that
place
which
would
make
a
return
to
it
unpleasant
to
her
.
<EOS>
If
she
could
have
said
as
much
,
even
to
Glencora
,
Mr.
Palliser
would
no
doubt
have
gone
round
,
 
round
by
any
more
distant
route
that
might
have
been
necessary
to
avoid
that
eternal
gateway
into
Switzerland
.
<EOS>
But
she
could
not
say
it
.
<EOS>
She
was
very
averse
to
talking
about
herself
and
her
own
affairs
,
even
with
her
cousin
.
<EOS>
Of
course
Lady
Glencora
knew
the
whole
story
of
Mr.
John
Grey
and
his
rejection
,
 
and
knew
much
also
of
that
other
story
of
Mr.
George
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
And
,
of
course
,
like
all
Alice
's
friends
,
she
hated
George
Vavasor
,
and
was
prepared
to
receive
Mr.
John
Grey
with
open
arms
,
if
there
were
any
possibility
that
her
cousin
would
open
her
arms
to
him
also
.
<EOS>
But
Alice
was
so
stubborn
about
her
own
affairs
that
her
friend
found
it
almost
impossible
to
speak
of
them
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
that
you
trouble
me
,
"
Alice
once
said
,
"
but
that
you
trouble
yourself
about
that
which
is
of
no
use
.
<EOS>
It
is
all
done
and
over
;
and
though
I
know
that
I
have
behaved
badly
,
 
very
badly
,
 
yet
<EOS>
I
believe
that
everything
has
been
done
for
the
best
.
<EOS>
I
am
inclined
to
think
that
I
can
live
alone
,
or
perhaps
with
my
cousin
Kate
,
more
happily
than
I
could
with
any
husband
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
such
nonsense
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
Perhaps
so
;
but
,
at
any
rate
,
I
mean
to
try
.
<EOS>
We
Vavasors
do
n't
seem
to
be
good
at
marrying
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
want
some
one
to
break
your
heart
for
you
;
that
's
what
you
want
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
In
saying
this
she
knew
but
little
of
the
state
of
her
friend
's
heart
,
and
perhaps
was
hardly
capable
of
understanding
it
.
<EOS>
With
all
the
fuss
that
Lady
Glencora
made
to
herself
,
 
with
all
the
tears
that
she
had
shed
about
her
lost
lover
,
and
was
so
often
shedding
,
 
with
all
her
continual
thinking
of
the
matter
,
she
had
never
loved
Burgo
Fitzgerald
as
Alice
Vavasor
had
loved
Mr.
Grey
.
<EOS>
But
her
nature
was
altogether
different
to
that
of
Alice
.
<EOS>
Love
with
her
had
in
it
a
gleam
of
poetry
,
a
spice
of
fun
,
a
touch
of
self
-
devotion
,
something
even
of
hero
-
worship
;
but
with
it
all
there
was
a
dash
of
devilry
,
and
an
aptitude
almost
for
wickedness
.
<EOS>
She
knew
Burgo
Fitzgerald
to
be
a
scapegrace
,
and
she
liked
him
the
better
on
that
account
.
<EOS>
She
despised
her
husband
because
he
had
no
vices
.
<EOS>
She
would
have
given
everything
she
had
to
Burgo
,
 
pouring
her
wealth
upon
him
with
a
total
disregard
of
herself
,
had
she
been
allowed
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
She
would
have
forgiven
him
sin
after
sin
,
and
might
perhaps
have
brought
him
round
,
at
last
,
to
some
life
not
absolutely
reckless
and
wretched
.
<EOS>
But
in
all
that
she
might
have
done
,
there
would
have
been
no
thoughtfulness
,
 
no
true
care
either
for
him
or
for
herself
.
<EOS>
And
now
that
she
was
married
there
was
no
thoughtfulness
,
or
care
either
for
herself
or
for
her
husband
.
<EOS>
She
was
ready
to
sacrifice
herself
for
him
,
if
any
sacrifice
might
be
required
of
her
.
<EOS>
She
believed
herself
to
be
unfit
for
him
,
and
would
have
submitted
to
be
divorced
,
 
or
smothered
out
of
the
way
,
for
the
matter
of
that
,
 
if
the
laws
of
the
land
would
have
permitted
it
.
<EOS>
But
she
had
never
for
a
moment
given
to
herself
the
task
of
thinking
what
conduct
on
her
part
might
be
the
best
for
his
welfare
.
  
<EOS>
But
Alice
's
love
had
been
altogether
of
another
kind
,
 
and
I
am
by
no
means
sure
that
it
was
better
suited
for
the
work
of
this
work
-
a
-
day
world
than
that
of
her
cousin
.
<EOS>
It
was
too
thoughtful
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
say
that
there
was
no
poetry
in
it
,
but
I
will
say
that
it
lacked
romance
.
<EOS>
Its
poetry
was
too
hard
for
romance
.
<EOS>
There
was
certainly
in
it
neither
fun
nor
wickedness
;
nor
was
there
,
I
fear
,
so
large
a
proportion
of
hero
-
worship
as
there
always
should
be
in
a
girl
's
heart
when
she
gives
it
away
.
<EOS>
But
there
was
in
it
an
amount
of
self
-
devotion
which
none
of
those
near
to
her
had
hitherto
understood
,
 
unless
it
were
that
one
to
whom
the
understanding
of
it
was
of
the
most
importance
.
<EOS>
In
all
the
troubles
of
her
love
,
of
her
engagements
,
and
her
broken
promises
,
she
had
thought
more
of
others
than
of
herself
,
 
and
,
indeed
,
those
troubles
had
chiefly
come
from
that
self
-
devotion
.
<EOS>
She
had
left
John
Grey
because
she
feared
that
she
would
do
him
no
good
as
his
wife
,
 
that
she
would
not
make
him
happy
;
and
she
had
afterwards
betrothed
herself
for
a
second
time
to
her
cousin
,
because
she
believed
that
she
could
serve
him
by
marrying
him
.
<EOS>
Of
course
she
had
been
wrong
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
very
wrong
to
give
up
the
man
she
did
love
,
and
more
wrong
again
in
suggesting
to
herself
the
possibility
of
marrying
the
man
she
did
not
love
.
<EOS>
She
knew
that
she
had
been
wrong
in
both
,
and
was
undergoing
repentance
with
very
bitter
inward
sackcloth
.
<EOS>
But
she
said
little
of
all
this
even
to
her
cousin
.
  
<EOS>
They
went
to
Lucerne
by
Basle
,
and
put
up
at
the
big
hotel
with
the
balcony
over
the
Rhine
,
which
Alice
remembered
so
well
.
<EOS>
On
the
first
evening
of
her
arrival
she
found
herself
again
looking
down
upon
the
river
,
as
though
it
might
have
been
from
the
same
spot
which
she
had
occupied
together
with
George
and
Kate
.
<EOS>
But
,
in
truth
,
that
house
is
very
large
,
and
has
many
bedrooms
over
the
water
.
<EOS>
Who
has
ever
been
through
Basle
,
and
not
stood
in
one
of
them
,
looking
down
upon
the
father
of
waters
?
<EOS>
Here
,
on
this
very
spot
,
in
one
of
these
balconies
,
was
brought
to
her
a
letter
from
her
cousin
Kate
,
which
was
filled
with
tidings
respecting
her
cousin
George
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
brought
it
to
her
with
his
own
hands
,
and
she
had
no
other
alternative
but
to
read
it
in
his
presence
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
George
has
lost
his
election
,
"
the
letter
began
.
<EOS>
For
one
moment
Alice
thought
of
her
money
,
and
the
vain
struggle
in
which
it
had
been
wasted
.
<EOS>
For
one
moment
,
something
like
regret
for
the
futility
of
the
effort
she
had
made
came
upon
her
.
<EOS>
But
it
passed
away
at
once
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
worth
our
while
to
try
it
,
"
she
said
to
herself
,
and
then
went
on
with
her
letter
.
<EOS>
"
I
and
Aunt
Greenow
are
up
in
London
,
"
the
letter
went
on
to
say
,
"
and
have
just
heard
the
news
.
<EOS>
Though
I
have
been
here
for
three
days
,
and
have
twice
sent
word
to
him
to
say
so
,
he
has
not
been
near
me
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
it
is
best
that
he
should
stay
away
,
as
I
do
not
know
how
any
words
could
pass
between
us
that
would
be
pleasant
.
<EOS>
The
poll
was
finished
this
afternoon
,
and
he
lost
his
election
by
a
large
majority
.
<EOS>
There
were
five
candidates
altogether
for
the
two
seats
 
three
Liberals
,
and
two
Conservatives
.
<EOS>
The
other
two
Liberals
were
seated
,
and
he
was
the
last
of
the
five
.
<EOS>
I
continue
to
hear
tidings
about
him
from
day
to
day
,
 
or
rather
,
my
aunt
hears
them
and
tells
them
to
me
,
which
fill
me
full
of
fears
as
to
his
future
career
.
<EOS>
I
believe
that
he
has
abandoned
his
business
,
and
that
he
has
now
no
source
of
income
.
<EOS>
I
would
willingly
share
what
I
have
with
him
;
or
I
would
do
more
than
that
.
<EOS>
After
keeping
back
enough
to
repay
you
gradually
what
he
owes
you
,
I
would
give
him
all
my
share
of
the
income
out
of
the
estate
.
<EOS>
But
I
can
not
do
this
while
we
are
presumed
to
be
enemies
.
<EOS>
I
am
up
here
to
see
a
lawyer
as
to
some
steps
which
he
is
taking
to
upset
grandpapa
's
will
.
<EOS>
The
lawyer
says
that
it
is
all
nonsense
,
and
that
George
's
lawyer
is
not
really
in
earnest
;
but
I
can
not
do
anything
till
the
matter
is
settled
.
<EOS>
Dear
Alice
,
though
so
much
of
your
money
is
for
a
time
gone
,
I
am
bound
to
congratulate
you
on
your
safety
,
 
on
what
I
may
more
truly
call
your
escape
.
<EOS>
You
will
understand
what
my
own
feelings
must
be
in
writing
this
,
after
all
that
I
did
to
bring
you
and
him
together
,
 
after
all
my
hopes
and
ambition
respecting
him
.
<EOS>
As
for
the
money
,
it
shall
be
repaid
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
I
shall
ever
dare
to
indulge
in
any
strong
desire
again
.
<EOS>
I
think
you
will
forgive
me
the
injury
I
have
done
you
;
 
and
I
know
that
you
will
pity
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
here
to
see
the
London
lawyer
,
 
but
not
only
for
that
.
<EOS>
Aunt
Greenow
is
buying
her
wedding
clothes
,
and
Captain
Bellfield
is
in
lodgings
near
to
us
,
also
buying
his
trousseau
;
or
,
as
I
should
more
properly
say
,
having
it
bought
for
him
.
<EOS>
I
am
hardly
in
a
mood
for
much
mirth
,
but
it
is
impossible
not
to
laugh
inwardly
when
she
discusses
before
me
the
state
of
his
wardrobe
,
and
proposes
economical
arrangements
 
greatly
to
his
disgust
.
<EOS>
At
present
,
she
holds
him
very
tightly
in
hand
,
and
makes
him
account
for
all
his
hours
as
well
as
all
his
money
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Of
course
,
he
'll
run
wild
<EOS>
directly
he
's
married
,
"
she
said
to
me
,
yesterday
;
"
and
,
of
course
,
there
'll
always
be
a
fight
about
it
;
but
the
more
I
do
to
tame
him
now
,
the
less
wild
he
'll
be
by
-
and
-
by
.
<EOS>
And
though
I
dare
say
,
I
shall
scold
him
sometimes
,
I
shall
never
quarrel
with
him
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
doubt
all
that
is
true
;
but
what
a
fool
she
is
to
trouble
herself
with
such
a
man
.
<EOS>
She
says
she
does
it
for
an
occupation
.
<EOS>
I
took
courage
to
tell
her
once
that
a
caged
tiger
would
give
her
as
much
to
do
,
and
be
less
dangerous
.
<EOS>
She
was
angry
at
this
,
and
answered
me
very
sharply
.
<EOS>
I
had
tried
my
hand
on
a
tiger
,
she
said
,
and
had
felt
his
claws
.
<EOS>
She
chose
to
sacrifice
herself
,
 
if
a
sacrifice
it
were
to
be
,
 
when
some
good
result
might
be
possible
.
<EOS>
I
had
nothing
further
to
say
;
and
from
that
time
to
this
we
have
been
on
the
pleasantest
terms
possible
as
to
the
Captain
.
<EOS>
They
have
settled
with
your
father
to
take
Vavasor
Hall
for
three
years
,
and
I
suppose
I
shall
stay
with
them
till
your
return
.
<EOS>
What
I
may
do
then
will
depend
entirely
upon
your
doings
.
<EOS>
I
feel
myself
to
be
a
desolate
,
solitary
being
,
without
any
tie
to
any
person
,
or
to
any
place
.
<EOS>
I
never
thought
that
I
should
feel
the
death
of
my
grandfather
to
be
such
a
loss
to
me
as
it
has
been
.
<EOS>
Except
you
,
I
have
nothing
left
to
me
;
and
,
as
regards
you
,
I
have
the
unpleasant
feeling
that
I
have
for
years
been
endeavouring
to
do
you
the
worst
possible
injury
,
and
that
you
must
regard
me
as
an
enemy
from
whom
you
have
escaped
indeed
,
but
not
without
terrible
wounds
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Alice
was
always
angered
by
any
assumption
that
her
conduct
to
Mr.
Grey
had
been
affected
by
the
advice
or
influence
of
her
cousin
Kate
.
<EOS>
But
this
very
feeling
seemed
to
preserve
Kate
from
the
worse
anger
,
which
might
have
been
aroused
against
her
,
had
Alice
acknowledged
the
injury
which
her
cousin
had
in
truth
done
to
her
.
<EOS>
It
was
undoubtedly
true
that
had
Alice
neither
seen
nor
heard
from
Kate
during
the
progress
of
John
Grey
's
courtship
,
John
Grey
would
not
have
lost
his
wife
.
<EOS>
But
against
this
truth
Alice
was
always
protesting
within
her
own
breast
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
weak
,
foolish
,
irresolute
,
 
and
had
finally
acted
with
false
judgement
.
<EOS>
So
much
she
now
admitted
to
herself
.
<EOS>
But
she
would
not
admit
that
any
other
woman
had
persuaded
her
to
such
weakness
.
<EOS>
"
She
mistakes
me
,
"
Alice
thought
,
as
she
put
up
her
letter
.
<EOS>
"
She
is
not
the
enemy
who
has
wounded
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
,
who
had
brought
her
the
letter
,
was
seated
in
the
same
balcony
,
and
while
Alice
had
been
reading
,
had
almost
buried
himself
in
newspapers
which
conveyed
intelligence
as
to
the
general
elections
then
in
progress
.
<EOS>
He
was
now
seated
with
a
sheet
of
_
<EOS>
The
Times
_
in
his
hand
,
opened
to
its
full
extent
,
 
for
he
had
been
too
impatient
to
cut
the
paper
,
 
and
<EOS>
as
he
held
it
up
in
his
hands
before
his
eyes
,
was
completely
hidden
beneath
it
.
<EOS>
Five
or
six
other
open
papers
were
around
him
,
and
he
had
not
spoken
a
word
since
he
had
commenced
his
present
occupation
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
was
standing
on
the
other
side
of
him
,
and
she
also
had
received
letters
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Sophy
tells
me
that
you
are
returned
for
Silverbridge
,
"
she
said
at
last
.
  
<EOS>
"
Who
?
<EOS>
I
!
<EOS>
yes
<EOS>
;
I
'm
returned
,
"
said
Mr.
Palliser
,
speaking
with
something
like
disdain
in
his
voice
as
to
the
possibility
of
anybody
having
stood
with
a
chance
of
success
against
him
in
his
own
family
borough
.
<EOS>
For
a
full
appreciation
of
the
advantages
of
a
private
seat
in
the
House
of
Commons
let
us
always
go
to
those
great
Whig
families
who
were
mainly
instrumental
in
carrying
the
Reform
Bill
.
<EOS>
The
house
of
Omnium
had
been
very
great
on
that
occasion
.
<EOS>
It
had
given
up
much
,
and
had
retained
for
family
use
simply
the
single
seat
at
Silverbridge
.
<EOS>
But
that
that
seat
should
be
seriously
disputed
hardly
suggested
itself
as
possible
to
the
mind
of
any
Palliser
.
<EOS>
The
Pallisers
and
the
other
great
Whig
families
have
been
right
in
this
.
<EOS>
They
have
kept
in
their
hands
,
as
rewards
for
their
own
services
to
the
country
,
no
more
than
the
country
is
manifestly
willing
to
give
them
.
"
<EOS>
Yes
;
I
have
been
returned
,
"
said
Mr.
Palliser
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
sorry
to
see
,
Miss
Vavasor
,
that
your
cousin
has
not
been
so
fortunate
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
So
I
find
,
"
said
Alice
.
<EOS>
"
It
will
be
a
great
misfortune
to
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
I
suppose
so
.
<EOS>
Those
Metropolitan
elections
cost
so
much
trouble
and
so
much
money
,
and
under
the
most
favourable
circumstances
,
are
so
doubtful
.
<EOS>
A
man
is
never
sure
there
till
he
has
fought
for
his
seat
three
or
four
times
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
This
has
been
the
third
time
with
him
,
"
said
Alice
,
"
and
he
is
a
poor
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
,
dear
,
"
said
Mr.
Palliser
,
who
himself
knew
nothing
of
such
misfortunes
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
always
thought
that
those
seats
should
be
left
to
rich
commercial
men
who
can
afford
to
spend
money
upon
them
.
<EOS>
Instead
of
that
,
they
are
generally
contested
by
men
of
moderate
means
.
<EOS>
Another
of
my
friends
in
the
House
has
been
thrown
out
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Who
is
that
unfortunate
?
"
asked
Lady
Glencora
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Bott
,
"
said
the
unthinking
husband
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Bott
out
!
"
exclaimed
Lady
Glencora
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Bott
thrown
out

I
am
so
glad
.
<EOS>
Alice
,
are
you
not
glad
?
<EOS>
The
red
-
haired
man
,
that
used
to
stand
about
,
you
know
,
at
Matching
;
 
he
has
lost
his
seat
in
Parliament
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
he
'll
go
and
stand
about
somewhere
in
Lancashire
,
now
.
"
  
<EOS>
A
very
indiscreet
woman
was
poor
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
's
face
became
black
beneath
_
<EOS>
The
Times
_
newspaper
.
<EOS>
"
I
did
not
know
,
"
said
he
,
"
that
my
friend
Mr.
Bott
and
Miss
Vavasor
were
enemies
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Enemies
!
<EOS>
I
do
n't
suppose
they
were
enemies
,
"
said
Glencora
.
<EOS>
"
But
he
was
a
man
whom
no
one
could
help
observing
,
 
and
disliking
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
was
a
man
I
specially
disliked
,
"
said
Alice
,
with
great
courage
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
may
be
very
well
in
Parliament
;
but
I
never
met
a
man
who
could
make
himself
so
disagreeable
in
society
.
<EOS>
I
really
did
feel
myself
constrained
to
be
his
enemy
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Bravo
,
Alice
!
"
said
Lady
Glencora
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
he
did
nothing
at
Matching
,
to
 
to
 
to
 
,
"
began
Mr.
Palliser
,
apologetically
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nothing
especially
to
offend
me
,
Mr.
Palliser
,
 
except
that
he
had
a
way
that
I
especially
dislike
of
trying
to
make
little
secret
confidences
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
then
he
was
so
ugly
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
felt
certain
that
he
endeavoured
to
do
mischief
,
"
said
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
he
did
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
;
"
and
he
had
a
habit
of
rubbing
his
head
against
the
papers
in
the
rooms
,
and
leaving
a
mark
behind
him
that
was
quite
unpardonable
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
was
effectually
talked
down
,
and
felt
himself
constrained
to
abandon
his
political
ally
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
he
did
this
the
easier
as
the
loss
which
Mr.
Bott
had
just
suffered
would
materially
interfere
with
his
political
utility
.
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
he
will
remain
now
among
his
own
people
,
"
said
Mr.
Palliser
.
  
<EOS>
"
Let
us
hope
he
will
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
,
 
"
and
that
his
own
people
will
appreciate
the
advantage
of
his
presence
.
<EOS>
"
Then
there
was
nothing
more
said
about
Mr.
Bott
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
evening
,
and
while
they
were
still
sitting
among
their
letters
and
newspapers
,
there
came
a
shout
along
the
water
,
and
the
noise
of
many
voices
from
the
bridge
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
,
there
shot
down
before
them
in
the
swift
running
stream
the
heads
of
many
swimmers
in
the
river
,
and
with
the
swimmers
came
boats
carrying
their
clothes
.
<EOS>
They
went
by
almost
like
a
glance
of
light
upon
the
waters
,
so
rapid
was
the
course
of
the
current
.
<EOS>
There
was
the
shout
of
voices
,
 
the
quick
passage
of
the
boats
,
 
the
uprising
,
some
half
a
dozen
times
,
of
the
men
's
hands
above
the
surface
;
and
then
they
were
gone
down
the
river
,
out
of
sight
,
 
like
morsels
of
wood
thrown
into
a
cataract
,
which
are
borne
away
instantly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
how
I
wish
I
could
do
that
!
"
said
Lady
Glencora
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
seems
to
be
very
dangerous
,
"
said
Mr.
Palliser
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
how
they
can
stop
themselves
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
should
they
want
to
stop
themselves
?
"
said
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
"
Think
how
cool
the
water
must
be
,
and
how
beautiful
to
be
carried
along
so
quickly
,
and
to
go
on
,
and
on
,
and
on
!
<EOS>
I
suppose
we
could
n't
try
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
As
no
encouragement
was
given
to
this
proposition
,
Lady
Glencora
did
not
repeat
it
;
but
stood
leaning
on
the
rail
of
the
balcony
,
and
looking
enviously
down
upon
the
water
.
<EOS>
Alice
was
,
of
course
,
thinking
of
that
other
evening
,
when
perhaps
the
same
swimmers
had
come
down
under
the
bridge
and
before
the
balcony
,
and
where
George
Vavasor
was
sitting
in
her
presence
.
<EOS>
It
was
,
I
think
,
on
that
evening
,
that
she
made
up
her
mind
to
separate
herself
from
Mr.
Grey
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
day
after
that
,
Mr.
Palliser
and
his
party
went
on
to
Lucerne
,
making
that
journey
,
as
I
have
said
,
by
slow
stages
;
taking
Schaffhausen
and
Zurich
in
their
way
.
<EOS>
At
Lucerne
,
they
established
themselves
for
some
time
,
occupying
nearly
a
dozen
rooms
in
the
great
hotel
which
overlooks
the
lake
.
<EOS>
Here
there
came
to
them
a
visitor
,
of
whose
arrival
I
will
speak
in
the
next
chapter
.
   
<EOS>
At
Lucerne
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
inclined
to
think
that
Mr.
Palliser
did
not
much
enjoy
this
part
of
his
tour
abroad
.
<EOS>
When
he
first
reached
Lucerne
there
was
no
one
there
with
whom
he
could
associate
pleasantly
,
nor
had
he
any
occupation
capable
of
making
his
time
run
easily
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
care
for
scenery
.
<EOS>
Close
at
his
elbow
was
the
finest
to
be
had
in
Europe
;
but
it
was
nothing
to
him
.
<EOS>
Had
he
been
simply
journeying
through
Lucerne
at
the
proper
time
of
the
year
for
such
a
journey
,
when
the
business
of
the
Session
was
over
,
and
a
little
change
of
air
needed
,
he
could
have
enjoyed
the
thing
in
a
moderate
way
,
looking
about
him
,
passing
on
,
and
knowing
that
it
was
good
for
him
to
be
there
at
that
moment
.
<EOS>
But
he
had
none
of
that
passion
for
mountains
and
lakes
,
none
of
that
positive
joy
in
the
heather
,
which
would
have
compensated
many
another
man
for
the
loss
of
all
that
Mr.
Palliser
was
losing
.
<EOS>
His
mind
was
ever
at
home
in
the
House
of
Commons
,
or
in
that
august
assembly
which
men
call
the
Cabinet
,
and
of
the
meetings
of
which
he
read
from
week
to
week
the
simple
records
.
<EOS>
Therein
were
mentioned
the
names
of
those
heroes
to
whom
Fortune
had
been
so
much
kinder
than
she
had
been
to
him
;
and
he
envied
them
.
<EOS>
He
took
short
,
solitary
walks
,
about
the
town
,
over
the
bridges
,
and
along
the
rivers
,
making
to
himself
the
speeches
which
he
would
have
made
to
full
houses
,
had
not
his
wife
brought
ruin
upon
all
his
hopes
.
<EOS>
And
as
he
pictured
to
himself
the
glorious
successes
which
probably
never
would
have
been
his
had
he
remained
in
London
,
so
did
he
prophesy
to
himself
an
absolute
and
irremediable
downfall
from
all
political
power
as
the
result
of
his
absence
,
 
having
,
in
truth
,
no
sufficient
cause
for
such
despair
.
<EOS>
As
yet
,
he
was
barely
thirty
,
and
had
he
been
able
to
judge
his
own
case
as
keenly
as
he
could
have
judged
the
case
of
another
,
he
would
have
known
that
a
short
absence
might
probably
raise
his
value
in
the
estimation
of
others
rather
than
lower
it
.
<EOS>
But
his
personal
annoyance
was
too
great
to
allow
of
his
making
such
calculations
aright
.
<EOS>
So
he
became
fretful
and
unhappy
;
and
though
he
spoke
no
word
of
rebuke
to
his
wife
,
though
he
never
hinted
that
she
had
robbed
him
of
his
glories
,
he
made
her
conscious
by
his
manner
that
she
had
brought
him
to
this
miserable
condition
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
herself
had
a
love
for
the
mountains
and
lakes
,
but
it
was
a
love
of
that
kind
which
requires
to
be
stimulated
by
society
,
and
which
is
keenest
among
cold
chickens
,
picnic
-
pies
,
and
the
flying
of
champagne
corks
.
<EOS>
When
they
first
entered
Switzerland
she
was
very
enthusiastic
,
and
declared
her
intention
of
climbing
up
all
the
mountains
,
and
going
through
all
the
passes
.
<EOS>
She
endeavoured
to
induce
her
husband
to
promise
that
she
should
be
taken
up
Mont
Blanc
.
<EOS>
And
I
think
she
would
have
carried
this
on
,
and
would
have
been
taken
up
Mont
Blanc
,
had
Mr.
Palliser
's
aspirations
been
congenial
.
<EOS>
But
they
were
not
congenial
,
and
Lady
Glencora
soon
lost
all
her
enthusiasm
.
<EOS>
By
the
time
that
they
were
settled
at
Lucerne
she
had
voted
the
mountains
to
be
bores
,
and
had
almost
learned
to
hate
the
lake
,
which
she
declared
always
made
her
wet
through
when
she
got
into
a
small
boat
,
and
sea
-
sick
when
she
put
her
foot
in
a
large
one
.
<EOS>
At
Lucerne
they
made
no
acquaintances
,
Mr.
Palliser
being
a
man
not
apt
to
new
friendships
.
<EOS>
They
did
not
even
dine
at
the
public
table
,
though
Lady
Glencora
had
expressed
a
wish
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
did
not
like
it
,
and
of
course
Lady
Glencora
gave
way
.
<EOS>
There
were
,
moreover
,
some
marital
passages
which
were
not
pleasant
to
a
third
person
.
<EOS>
They
did
not
scold
each
other
;
but
Lady
Glencora
would
make
little
speeches
of
which
her
husband
disapproved
.
<EOS>
She
would
purposely
irritate
him
by
continuing
her
tone
of
badinage
,
and
then
Mr.
Palliser
would
become
fretful
,
and
would
look
as
though
the
cares
of
the
world
were
too
many
for
him
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
,
therefore
,
say
that
Alice
had
much
to
make
the
first
period
of
her
sojourn
at
Lucerne
a
period
of
enjoyment
.
  
<EOS>
But
when
they
had
been
there
about
a
fortnight
,
a
stranger
arrived
,
whose
coming
at
any
rate
lent
the
grace
of
some
excitement
to
their
lives
.
<EOS>
Their
custom
was
to
breakfast
at
nine
,
 
or
as
near
nine
as
Lady
Glencora
could
be
induced
to
appear
,
 
and
then
Mr.
Palliser
would
read
till
three
.
<EOS>
At
that
hour
he
would
walk
forth
by
himself
,
after
having
handed
the
two
ladies
into
their
carriage
,
and
they
would
be
driven
about
for
two
hours
.
<EOS>
"
How
I
do
hate
this
carriage
,
"
Lady
Glencora
said
one
day
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
so
wish
it
would
come
to
grief
,
and
be
broken
to
pieces
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
whether
the
Swiss
people
think
that
we
are
going
to
be
driven
about
here
for
ever
.
<EOS>
"
There
were
moments
,
however
,
which
seemed
to
indicate
that
Lady
Glencora
had
something
to
tell
her
cousin
,
which
,
if
told
,
would
alter
the
monotony
of
their
lives
.
<EOS>
Alice
,
however
,
would
not
press
her
for
her
secret
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
have
anything
to
tell
,
why
do
n't
you
tell
it
?
"
<EOS>
Alice
once
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
so
hard
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
you
tell
me
very
often
,
"
Alice
replied
;
"
and
it
is
not
complimentary
.
<EOS>
But
hard
or
soft
,
I
wo
n't
make
a
petition
for
your
confidence
.
"
<EOS>
Then
Lady
Glencora
said
something
savage
,
and
the
subject
was
dropped
for
a
while
.
  
<EOS>
But
we
must
go
back
to
the
stranger
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
had
put
the
ladies
into
their
carriage
,
and
was
standing
between
the
front
door
of
the
hotel
and
the
lake
on
a
certain
day
,
doubting
whether
he
would
walk
up
the
hill
to
the
left
or
turn
into
the
town
on
the
right
,
when
he
was
accosted
by
an
English
gentleman
,
who
,
raising
his
hat
,
said
that
he
believed
that
he
spoke
to
Mr.
Palliser
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
Mr.
Palliser
,
"
said
our
friend
,
very
courteously
,
returning
the
salute
,
and
smiling
as
he
spoke
.
<EOS>
But
though
he
smiled
,
and
though
he
was
courteous
,
and
though
he
raised
his
hat
,
there
was
something
in
his
look
and
voice
which
would
not
have
encouraged
any
ordinary
stranger
to
persevere
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
was
not
a
man
with
whom
it
was
easy
to
open
an
acquaintance
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
name
is
John
Grey
,
"
said
the
stranger
.
  
<EOS>
Then
the
smile
was
dropped
,
the
look
of
extreme
courtesy
disappeared
,
the
tone
of
Mr.
Palliser
's
voice
was
altered
,
and
he
put
out
his
hand
.
<EOS>
He
knew
enough
of
Mr.
John
Grey
's
history
to
be
aware
that
Mr.
John
Grey
was
a
man
with
whom
he
might
permit
himself
to
become
acquainted
.
<EOS>
After
the
interchange
of
a
very
few
words
,
the
two
men
started
off
for
a
walk
together
.
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
you
do
n't
wish
to
meet
the
carriage
?
"
said
Mr.
Palliser
.
<EOS>
"
If
so
,
we
had
better
go
through
the
town
and
up
the
river
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
They
went
through
the
town
,
and
up
the
river
,
and
when
Mr.
Palliser
,
on
his
return
,
was
seen
by
Alice
and
Lady
Glencora
,
he
was
alone
.
<EOS>
They
dined
together
,
and
nothing
was
said
.
<EOS>
Together
they
sauntered
out
in
the
evening
,
and
together
came
in
and
drank
their
tea
;
but
still
nothing
was
said
.
<EOS>
At
last
,
Alice
and
her
cousin
took
their
candles
from
Mr.
Palliser
's
hands
and
left
the
sitting
-
room
for
the
night
.
  
<EOS>
"
Alice
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
,
as
soon
as
they
were
in
the
passage
together
,
"
I
have
been
dying
for
this
time
to
come
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
speak
before
,
or
I
should
have
made
blunders
,
and
so
would
you
.
<EOS>
Let
us
go
into
your
room
at
once
.
<EOS>
Who
do
you
think
is
here
,
at
Lucerne
,
in
this
house
,
at
this
very
moment
?
"
  
<EOS>
Alice
knew
at
once
who
it
was
.
<EOS>
She
knew
,
immediately
,
that
Mr.
Grey
had
followed
her
,
though
no
word
had
been
written
to
her
or
spoken
to
her
on
the
subject
since
that
day
on
which
he
himself
had
told
her
that
they
would
meet
abroad
.
<EOS>
But
though
she
was
quite
sure
,
she
did
not
mention
his
name
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Who
is
it
,
Glencora
?
"
<EOS>
she
asked
,
very
calmly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Whom
in
all
the
world
would
you
best
like
to
see
?
"
said
Glencora
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
cousin
Kate
,
certainly
,
"
said
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
it
is
not
your
cousin
Kate
.
<EOS>
And
I
do
n't
believe
you
;
 
or
else
you
're
a
fool
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Alice
was
accustomed
to
Lady
Glencora
's
mode
of
talking
,
and
therefore
did
not
think
much
of
this
.
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
I
am
a
fool
,
"
she
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
Only
I
know
you
are
not
.
<EOS>
But
I
am
not
at
all
so
sure
as
to
your
being
no
hypocrite
.
<EOS>
The
person
I
mean
is
a
gentleman
,
of
course
.
<EOS>
Why
do
n't
you
show
a
little
excitement
,
at
any
rate
?
<EOS>
When
Plantagenet
told
me
,
just
before
dinner
,
I
almost
jumped
out
of
my
shoes
.
<EOS>
He
was
going
to
tell
you
himself
after
dinner
,
in
the
politest
way
in
the
world
,
no
doubt
,
and
just
as
the
servants
were
carrying
away
the
apples
.
<EOS>
I
thought
it
best
to
save
you
from
that
;
but
,
I
declare
,
I
believe
I
might
have
left
him
to
do
it
;
it
would
have
had
no
effect
upon
you
.
<EOS>
Who
is
it
that
has
come
,
do
you
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
I
know
now
,
"
said
Alice
,
very
calmly
,
"
that
Mr.
John
Grey
has
come
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Mr.
John
Grey
has
come
.
<EOS>
He
is
here
in
this
house
at
this
minute
;
 
or
,
more
probably
,
waiting
outside
by
the
lake
till
he
shall
see
a
light
in
your
bedroom
.
"
<EOS>
Then
Lady
Glencora
paused
for
a
moment
,
waiting
that
Alice
might
say
something
.
<EOS>
But
Alice
said
nothing
.
"
<EOS>
Well
?
"
said
Lady
Glencora
,
rising
up
from
her
chair
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Well
?
"
said
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
Have
you
nothing
to
say
?
<EOS>
Is
it
the
same
to
you
as
though
Mr.
Smith
had
come
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
not
exactly
the
same
.
<EOS>
I
am
quite
alive
to
the
importance
of
Mr.
Grey
's
arrival
,
and
shall
probably
lie
awake
all
night
thinking
about
it
,
 
if
it
will
do
you
any
good
to
know
that
;
but
I
do
n't
feel
that
I
have
much
to
say
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
had
let
Mr.
Palliser
tell
you
,
in
an
ordinary
way
,
before
all
the
servants
.
<EOS>
I
do
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
would
not
have
made
much
difference
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
the
least
,
I
believe
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
whether
you
ever
did
care
for
anybody
in
your
life
,
 
for
him
,
or
for
that
other
one
,
or
for
anybody
.
<EOS>
For
nobody
,
I
believe
;
 
except
your
cousin
Kate
.
<EOS>
Still
waters
,
they
say
,
run
deep
;
and
sometimes
I
think
your
waters
run
too
deep
for
me
to
fathom
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
I
may
go
now
,
if
you
have
got
nothing
more
to
say
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
want
me
to
say
?
<EOS>
Of
course
I
know
why
he
has
come
here
.
<EOS>
He
told
me
he
should
come
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
have
never
said
a
word
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
told
me
he
should
come
,
and
I
thought
it
better
not
to
say
a
word
about
it
.
<EOS>
He
might
change
his
mind
,
or
anything
might
happen
.
<EOS>
I
told
him
not
to
come
;
and
it
would
have
been
much
better
that
he
should
have
remained
away
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
;
 
why
;
 
why
would
it
be
better
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Because
his
being
here
will
do
no
good
to
any
one
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
good
!
<EOS>
It
seems
to
me
impossible
but
that
it
should
do
all
the
good
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
Look
here
,
Alice
.
<EOS>
If
you
do
not
altogether
make
it
up
with
him
before
to
-
morrow
evening
,
I
shall
believe
you
to
be
utterly
heartless
.
<EOS>
Had
I
been
you
<EOS>
I
should
have
been
in
his
arms
before
this
.
<EOS>
I
'll
go
now
,
and
leave
you
to
lie
awake
,
as
you
say
you
will
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Then
she
left
the
room
,
but
returned
in
a
moment
to
ask
another
question
.
<EOS>
"
What
is
Plantagenet
to
say
to
him
about
seeing
you
to
-
morrow
?
<EOS>
Of
course
he
has
asked
permission
to
come
and
call
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
He
may
come
if
he
pleases
.
<EOS>
You
do
n't
think
I
have
quarrelled
with
him
,
or
would
refuse
to
see
him
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
may
we
ask
him
to
dine
with
us
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
yes
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
make
up
a
picnic
,
and
all
the
rest
of
it
.
<EOS>
In
fact
,
he
is
to
be
regarded
as
only
an
ordinary
person
.
<EOS>
Well
;
 
good
night
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
understand
you
,
that
's
all
.
"
  
<EOS>
It
may
be
doubted
whether
Alice
understood
herself
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
her
friend
was
gone
,
she
put
out
her
candle
and
seated
herself
at
the
open
window
of
her
room
,
looking
out
upon
the
moonlight
as
it
played
upon
the
lake
.
<EOS>
Would
he
be
there
,
thinking
of
her
,
looking
up
,
perhaps
,
as
Glencora
had
hinted
,
to
see
if
he
could
distinguish
her
light
among
the
hundred
that
would
be
flickering
across
the
long
front
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
If
it
were
so
,
at
any
rate
he
should
not
see
her
,
so
she
drew
the
curtain
,
and
sat
there
watching
the
lake
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
pity
that
he
should
have
come
,
and
yet
she
loved
him
dearly
for
coming
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
pity
that
he
should
have
come
,
as
his
coming
could
lead
to
no
good
result
.
<EOS>
Of
this
she
assured
herself
over
and
over
again
,
and
yet
she
hardly
knew
why
she
was
so
sure
of
it
.
<EOS>
Glencora
had
called
her
hard
;
but
her
conviction
on
that
matter
had
not
come
from
hardness
.
<EOS>
Now
that
she
was
alone
,
her
heart
was
full
of
love
,
of
the
soft
romance
of
love
towards
this
man
;
and
yet
she
felt
that
she
ought
not
to
marry
him
,
even
though
he
might
still
be
willing
to
take
her
.
<EOS>
That
he
was
still
willing
to
take
her
,
that
he
desired
to
have
her
for
his
wife
in
spite
of
all
the
injury
she
had
done
him
,
there
could
be
no
doubt
.
<EOS>
Why
else
had
he
followed
her
to
Switzerland
?
<EOS>
And
she
remembered
,
now
at
this
moment
,
how
he
had
told
her
at
Cheltenham
that
he
would
never
consider
her
to
be
lost
to
him
,
unless
she
should
,
in
truth
,
become
the
wife
of
another
man
.
<EOS>
Why
,
then
,
should
it
not
be
as
he
wished
it
?
  
<EOS>
She
asked
herself
the
question
,
and
did
not
answer
it
;
but
still
she
felt
that
it
might
not
be
so
.
<EOS>
She
had
no
right
to
such
happiness
after
the
evil
that
she
had
done
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
driven
by
a
frenzy
to
do
that
which
she
herself
could
not
pardon
;
and
having
done
it
,
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
accept
the
position
which
should
have
been
the
reward
of
good
conduct
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
analyse
the
causes
which
made
her
feel
that
she
must
still
refuse
the
love
that
was
proffered
to
her
;
she
could
not
clearly
read
her
own
thoughts
;
but
the
causes
were
as
I
have
said
,
and
such
was
the
true
reading
of
her
thoughts
.
<EOS>
Had
she
simply
refused
his
hand
after
she
had
once
accepted
it
,
 
had
she
refused
it
,
and
then
again
changed
her
mind
,
she
could
have
brought
herself
to
ask
him
to
forgive
her
.
<EOS>
But
she
had
done
so
much
more
than
this
,
and
so
much
worse
!
<EOS>
She
had
affianced
herself
to
another
man
since
she
had
belonged
to
him
,
 
since
she
had
been
his
,
as
his
future
wife
.
<EOS>
What
must
he
not
think
of
her
,
and
what
not
suspect
?
<EOS>
Then
she
remembered
those
interviews
which
she
had
had
with
her
cousin
since
she
had
written
to
him
,
accepting
his
offer
.
<EOS>
When
he
had
been
with
her
in
Queen
Anne
Street
she
had
shrunk
from
all
outward
signs
of
a
love
which
she
did
not
feel
.
<EOS>
There
had
been
no
caress
between
them
.
<EOS>
She
had
not
allowed
him
to
touch
her
with
his
lips
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
impossible
that
the
nature
of
that
mad
engagement
between
her
and
her
cousin
George
should
ever
be
made
known
to
Mr.
Grey
.
<EOS>
She
sat
there
wiping
the
tears
from
her
eyes
as
she
looked
for
his
figure
among
the
figures
by
the
lake
-
side
;
but
,
as
she
sat
there
,
she
promised
herself
no
happiness
from
his
coming
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
reader
,
can
you
forgive
her
in
that
she
had
sinned
against
the
softness
of
her
feminine
nature
?
<EOS>
I
think
that
she
may
be
forgiven
,
in
that
she
had
never
brought
herself
to
think
lightly
of
her
own
fault
.
  
<EOS>
If
he
were
there
,
by
the
lake
-
side
,
she
did
not
see
him
.
<EOS>
I
think
we
may
say
that
John
Grey
was
not
a
man
to
console
himself
in
his
love
by
looking
up
at
his
lady
's
candle
.
<EOS>
He
was
one
who
was
capable
of
doing
as
much
as
most
men
in
the
pursuit
of
his
love
,
 
as
he
proved
to
be
the
case
when
he
followed
Alice
to
Cheltenham
,
and
again
to
London
,
and
now
again
to
Lucerne
;
but
I
doubt
whether
a
glimmer
from
her
bedroom
-
window
,
had
it
been
unmistakably
her
own
glimmer
,
and
not
that
of
some
ugly
old
French
woman
who
might
chance
to
sleep
next
to
her
,
would
have
done
him
much
good
.
<EOS>
He
had
come
to
Lucerne
with
a
purpose
,
which
purpose
,
if
it
might
be
possible
,
he
meant
to
carry
out
;
but
I
think
he
was
already
in
bed
,
being
tired
with
long
travel
,
before
Lady
Glencora
had
left
Alice
's
room
.
  
<EOS>
At
breakfast
the
next
morning
nothing
was
said
for
a
while
about
the
new
arrival
.
<EOS>
At
last
Mr.
Palliser
ventured
to
speak
.
"
<EOS>
Glencora
has
told
you
,
I
think
,
that
Mr.
Grey
is
here
?
<EOS>
Mr.
Grey
is
an
old
friend
of
yours
,
I
believe
?
"
  
<EOS>
Alice
,
keeping
her
countenance
as
well
as
she
was
able
,
said
Mr.
Grey
had
been
,
and
,
indeed
,
was
,
a
very
dear
friend
of
hers
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
knew
the
whole
story
,
and
what
was
the
use
of
any
little
attempt
at
dissimulation
?
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
glad
to
see
him
,
 
if
you
will
allow
me
?
<EOS>
"
she
went
on
to
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
Glencora
suggests
that
we
should
ask
him
to
dinner
,
"
said
Mr.
Palliser
;
and
then
that
matter
was
settled
.
  
<EOS>
But
Mr.
Grey
did
not
wait
till
dinner
-
time
to
see
Alice
.
<EOS>
Early
in
the
morning
his
card
was
brought
up
,
and
Lady
Glencora
,
as
soon
as
she
saw
the
name
,
immediately
ran
away
.
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
you
need
not
go
,
"
said
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
I
shall
go
,
"
said
her
ladyship
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
what
's
proper
on
these
occasions
,
if
you
do
n't
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
So
she
went
,
whisking
herself
along
the
passages
with
a
little
run
;
and
Mr.
Grey
,
as
he
was
shown
into
her
ladyship
's
usual
sitting
-
room
,
saw
the
skirt
of
her
ladyship
's
dress
as
she
whisked
herself
off
towards
her
husband
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
told
you
I
should
come
,
"
he
said
,
with
his
ordinary
sweet
smile
.
<EOS>
"
I
told
you
that
I
should
follow
you
,
and
here
I
am
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
took
her
hand
,
and
held
it
,
pressing
it
warmly
.
<EOS>
She
hardly
knew
with
what
words
first
to
address
him
,
or
how
to
get
her
hand
back
from
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
glad
to
see
you
,
 
as
an
old
friend
,
"
she
said
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
hope
 
"
  
"
<EOS>
Well
;
 
you
hope
what
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
have
had
some
better
cause
for
travelling
than
a
desire
to
see
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
dearest
;
<EOS>
no
.
<EOS>
I
have
had
no
better
cause
,
and
,
indeed
,
none
other
.
<EOS>
I
have
come
on
purpose
to
see
you
;
and
had
Mr.
Palliser
taken
you
off
to
Asia
or
Africa
<EOS>
,
I
think
I
should
have
felt
myself
compelled
to
follow
him
.
<EOS>
You
know
why
I
follow
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Hardly
,
"
said
she
,
 
not
finding
at
the
moment
any
other
word
that
she
could
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
Because
I
love
you
.
<EOS>
You
see
what
a
plain
-
spoken
John
Bull
I
am
,
and
how
I
come
to
the
point
at
once
.
<EOS>
I
want
you
to
be
my
wife
;
and
they
say
that
perseverance
is
the
best
way
when
a
man
has
such
a
want
as
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
ought
not
to
want
it
,
"
she
said
,
whispering
the
words
as
though
she
were
unable
to
speak
them
out
loud
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
do
,
you
see
.
<EOS>
And
why
should
I
not
want
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
fit
to
be
your
wife
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
the
best
judge
of
that
,
Alice
.
<EOS>
You
have
to
make
up
your
mind
whether
I
am
fit
to
be
your
husband
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
would
be
disgraced
if
you
were
to
take
me
,
after
all
that
has
passed
;
 
after
what
I
have
done
.
<EOS>
What
would
other
men
say
of
you
when
they
knew
the
story
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Other
men
,
I
hope
,
would
be
just
enough
to
say
,
that
when
I
had
made
up
my
mind
,
I
was
tolerably
constant
in
keeping
to
it
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
they
could
say
much
worse
of
me
than
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
would
say
that
you
had
been
jilted
,
and
had
forgiven
the
jilt
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
As
far
as
the
forgiveness
goes
,
they
would
tell
the
truth
.
<EOS>
But
,
indeed
,
Alice
,
I
do
n't
very
much
care
what
men
do
say
of
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
care
,
Mr.
Grey
;
 
and
though
you
may
forgive
me
,
I
can
not
forgive
myself
.
<EOS>
Indeed
I
know
now
,
as
I
have
known
all
along
,
that
I
am
not
fit
to
be
your
wife
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
good
enough
.
<EOS>
And
I
have
done
that
which
makes
me
feel
that
I
have
no
right
to
marry
anyone
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
These
words
she
said
,
jerking
out
the
different
sentences
almost
in
convulsions
;
and
when
she
had
come
to
the
end
of
them
,
the
tears
were
streaming
down
her
cheeks
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
thought
about
it
,
and
I
will
not
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
.
<EOS>
After
what
has
passed
,
I
know
that
it
will
be
better
,
 
more
seemly
,
that
I
should
remain
as
I
am
.
"
  
<EOS>
Soon
after
that
she
left
him
,
not
,
however
,
till
she
had
told
him
that
she
would
meet
him
again
at
dinner
,
and
had
begged
him
to
treat
her
simply
as
a
friend
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
In
spite
of
everything
,
I
hope
that
we
may
always
be
friends
,
 
dear
friends
,
"
she
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
we
may
,
"
he
answered
;
 
"
the
very
dearest
.
"
<EOS>
And
then
he
left
her
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
afternoon
he
again
encountered
Mr.
Palliser
,
and
having
thought
over
the
matter
since
his
interview
with
Alice
,
he
resolved
to
tell
his
whole
story
to
his
new
acquaintance
,
 
not
in
order
that
he
might
ask
for
counsel
from
him
,
for
in
this
matter
he
wanted
no
man
's
advice
,
 
but
that
he
might
get
some
assistance
.
<EOS>
So
the
two
men
walked
off
together
,
up
the
banks
of
the
clear
-
flowing
Reuss
,
and
Mr.
Palliser
felt
the
comfort
of
having
a
companion
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
always
liked
her
,
"
said
Mr.
Palliser
,
"
though
,
to
tell
the
truth
,
I
have
twice
been
very
angry
with
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
never
been
angry
with
her
,
"
said
the
lover
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
my
anger
was
in
both
instances
unjust
.
<EOS>
You
may
imagine
how
great
is
my
confidence
in
her
,
when
I
have
thought
she
was
the
best
companion
my
wife
could
have
for
a
long
journey
,
taken
under
circumstances
that
were
 
that
were
 
;
but
I
need
not
trouble
you
with
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
So
great
had
been
the
desolation
of
Mr.
Palliser
's
life
since
his
banishment
from
London
that
he
almost
felt
tempted
to
tell
the
story
of
his
troubles
to
this
absolute
stranger
.
<EOS>
But
he
bethought
himself
of
the
blood
of
the
Pallisers
,
and
refrained
.
<EOS>
There
are
comforts
which
royalty
may
never
enjoy
,
and
luxuries
in
which
such
men
as
Plantagenet
Palliser
may
not
permit
themselves
to
indulge
.
  
<EOS>
"
About
her
and
her
character
I
have
no
doubt
in
the
world
,
"
said
Grey
.
<EOS>
"
In
all
that
she
has
done
I
think
that
I
have
seen
her
motives
;
and
though
I
have
not
approved
of
them
,
I
have
always
known
them
to
be
pure
and
unselfish
.
<EOS>
She
has
done
nothing
that
I
did
not
forgive
as
soon
as
it
was
done
.
<EOS>
Had
she
married
that
man
,
I
should
have
forgiven
her
even
that
,
 
though
I
should
have
known
that
all
her
future
life
was
destroyed
,
and
much
of
mine
also
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
can
make
her
happy
if
she
will
marry
me
,
but
she
must
first
be
taught
to
forgive
herself
.
<EOS>
Living
as
she
is
with
you
,
and
with
your
wife
,
she
may
,
perhaps
,
just
now
be
more
under
your
influence
and
your
wife
's
than
she
can
possibly
be
under
mine
.
"
<EOS>
Whereupon
,
Mr.
Palliser
promised
that
he
would
do
what
he
could
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
she
loves
me
,
"
said
Mr.
Grey
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
said
that
he
was
sure
she
did
,
though
what
ground
he
had
for
such
assurance
<EOS>
I
am
quite
unable
to
surmise
.
<EOS>
He
was
probably
desirous
of
saying
the
most
civil
thing
which
occurred
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
The
little
dinner
-
party
that
evening
was
pleasant
enough
,
and
nothing
more
was
said
about
love
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
talked
nonsense
to
Mr.
Grey
,
and
Mr.
Palliser
contradicted
all
the
nonsense
which
his
wife
talked
.
<EOS>
But
this
was
all
done
in
such
a
way
that
the
evening
passed
away
pleasantly
.
<EOS>
It
was
tacitly
admitted
among
them
that
Mr.
Grey
was
to
be
allowed
to
come
among
them
as
a
friend
,
and
Lady
Glencora
managed
to
say
one
word
to
him
aside
,
in
which
she
promised
to
give
him
her
most
cordial
cooperation
.
   
<EOS>
Showing
How
George
Vavasor
Received
a
Visit
.
 
<EOS>
We
must
go
back
for
a
few
pages
to
scenes
which
happened
in
London
during
this
summer
,
so
that
the
reader
may
understand
Mr.
Grey
's
position
when
he
reached
Lucerne
.
<EOS>
He
had
undergone
another
quarrel
with
George
Vavasor
,
and
something
of
the
circumstances
of
that
quarrel
must
be
told
.
  
<EOS>
It
has
been
already
said
that
George
Vavasor
lost
his
election
for
the
Chelsea
Districts
,
after
all
the
money
which
he
had
spent
,
 
money
which
he
had
been
so
ill
able
to
spend
,
and
on
which
he
had
laid
his
hands
in
a
manner
so
disreputable
!
<EOS>
He
had
received
two
thousand
pounds
from
the
bills
which
Alice
had
executed
on
his
behalf
,
 
or
rather
,
had
received
the
full
value
of
three
out
of
the
four
bills
,
and
a
part
of
the
value
of
the
fourth
,
on
which
he
had
been
driven
to
raise
what
immediate
money
he
had
wanted
by
means
of
a
Jew
bill
-
discounter
.
<EOS>
One
thousand
pounds
he
had
paid
over
at
once
into
the
hands
of
Mr.
Scruby
,
his
Parliamentary
election
agent
,
towards
the
expenses
of
his
election
;
and
when
the
day
of
polling
arrived
had
exactly
in
his
hands
the
sum
of
five
hundred
pounds
.
<EOS>
Where
he
was
to
get
more
when
this
was
gone
<EOS>
he
did
not
know
.
<EOS>
If
he
were
successful
,
 
if
the
enlightened
constituents
of
the
Chelsea
Districts
,
contented
with
his
efforts
on
behalf
of
the
River
Bank
,
should
again
send
him
to
Parliament
,
he
thought
that
he
might
still
carry
on
the
war
.
<EOS>
A
sum
of
ready
money
he
would
have
in
hand
;
and
,
as
to
his
debts
,
he
would
be
grandly
indifferent
to
any
consideration
of
them
.
<EOS>
Then
there
might
be
pickings
in
the
way
of
a
Member
of
Parliament
of
his
calibre
.
<EOS>
Companies
,
 
mercantile
companies
,
 
would
be
glad
to
have
him
as
a
director
,
paying
him
a
guinea
a
day
,
or
perhaps
more
,
for
his
hour
's
attendance
.
<EOS>
Railways
in
want
of
vice
-
chairmen
might
bid
for
his
services
;
and
in
the
City
he
might
turn
that
"
M.P.
"
which
belonged
to
him
to
good
account
in
various
ways
.
<EOS>
With
such
a
knowledge
of
the
City
world
as
he
possessed
,
he
thought
that
he
could
pick
up
a
living
in
London
,
if
only
he
could
retain
his
seat
in
Parliament
.
  
<EOS>
But
what
was
he
to
do
if
he
could
not
retain
it
?
<EOS>
No
sooner
had
Mr.
Scruby
got
the
thousand
pounds
into
his
clutches
than
he
pressed
for
still
more
money
.
<EOS>
George
Vavasor
,
with
some
show
of
justice
on
his
side
,
pointed
out
to
this
all
-
devouring
agent
that
the
sum
demanded
had
already
been
paid
.
<EOS>
This
Mr.
Scruby
admitted
,
declaring
that
he
was
quite
prepared
to
go
on
without
any
further
immediate
remittance
,
although
by
doing
so
might
subject
himself
to
considerable
risk
.
<EOS>
But
another
five
hundred
pounds
,
paid
at
once
,
would
add
greatly
to
the
safety
of
the
seat
;
whereas
eight
hundred
judiciously
thrown
in
at
the
present
moment
would
make
the
thing
quite
secure
.
<EOS>
But
Vavasor
swore
to
himself
that
he
would
not
part
with
another
shilling
.
<EOS>
Never
had
he
felt
such
love
for
money
as
he
did
for
that
five
hundred
pounds
which
he
now
held
in
his
pocket
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
no
use
,
"
he
said
to
Mr.
Scruby
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
done
what
you
asked
,
and
would
have
done
more
<EOS>
had
you
asked
for
more
at
that
time
.
<EOS>
As
it
is
,
I
can
not
make
another
payment
before
the
election
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Scruby
shrugged
his
shoulders
,
and
said
that
he
would
do
his
best
.
<EOS>
But
George
Vavasor
soon
knew
that
the
man
was
not
doing
his
best
,
 
that
the
man
had
,
in
truth
,
abandoned
his
cause
.
<EOS>
The
landlord
of
the
"
Handsome
Man
"
jeered
him
when
he
went
there
canvassing
.
<EOS>
"
Laws
,
Mr.
Vavasor
!
"
said
the
landlord
of
the
"
Handsome
Man
,
"
"
you
're
not
at
all
the
fellow
for
us
chaps
along
the
river
,
 
you
ai
n't
.
<EOS>
You
're
afraid
to
come
down
with
the
stumpy
,
 
<EOS>
that
's
what
you
are
.
"
<EOS>
George
put
his
hand
upon
his
purse
,
and
acknowledged
to
himself
that
he
had
been
afraid
to
come
down
with
the
stumpy
.
  
<EOS>
For
the
last
five
days
of
the
affair
George
Vavasor
knew
that
his
chance
was
gone
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Scruby
's
face
,
manner
,
and
words
,
told
the
result
of
the
election
as
plainly
as
any
subsequent
figures
could
do
.
<EOS>
He
would
be
absent
when
Vavasor
called
,
or
the
clerk
would
say
that
he
was
absent
.
<EOS>
He
would
answer
in
very
few
words
,
constantly
shrugging
his
shoulders
.
<EOS>
He
would
even
go
away
and
leave
the
anxious
candidate
while
he
was
in
the
middle
of
some
discussion
as
to
his
plans
.
<EOS>
It
was
easy
to
see
that
Mr.
Scruby
no
longer
regarded
him
as
a
successful
man
,
and
the
day
of
the
poll
showed
very
plainly
how
right
Mr.
Scruby
had
been
.
  
<EOS>
George
Vavasor
was
rejected
,
but
he
still
had
his
five
hundred
pounds
in
his
pocket
.
<EOS>
Of
course
he
was
subject
to
that
mortification
which
a
man
feels
when
he
reflects
that
some
little
additional
outlay
would
have
secured
his
object
.
<EOS>
Whether
it
might
have
been
so
,
or
not
,
who
can
say
?
<EOS>
But
there
he
was
,
with
the
gateway
between
the
lamps
barred
against
him
,
ex
-
Member
of
Parliament
for
the
Chelsea
Districts
,
with
five
hundred
pounds
in
his
pocket
,
and
little
or
nothing
else
that
he
could
call
his
own
.
<EOS>
What
was
he
to
do
with
himself
?
  
<EOS>
After
trying
to
make
himself
heard
upon
the
hustings
when
he
was
rejected
,
and
pledging
himself
to
stand
again
at
the
next
election
,
he
went
home
to
his
lodgings
in
Cecil
Street
,
and
endeavoured
to
consider
calmly
his
position
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
He
had
lost
his
inheritance
.
<EOS>
He
had
abandoned
one
profession
after
another
,
and
was
now
beyond
the
pale
of
another
chance
in
that
direction
.
<EOS>
His
ambition
had
betrayed
him
,
and
there
were
no
longer
possible
to
him
any
hopes
of
political
activity
.
<EOS>
He
had
estranged
from
himself
every
friend
that
he
had
ever
possessed
.
<EOS>
He
had
driven
from
him
with
violence
the
devotion
even
of
his
sister
.
<EOS>
He
had
robbed
the
girl
whom
he
intended
to
marry
of
her
money
,
and
had
so
insulted
her
that
no
feeling
of
amity
between
them
was
any
longer
possible
.
<EOS>
He
had
nothing
now
but
himself
and
that
five
hundred
pounds
,
which
he
still
held
in
his
pocket
.
<EOS>
What
should
he
do
with
himself
and
his
money
?
<EOS>
He
thought
over
it
all
with
outer
calmness
for
awhile
,
as
he
sat
there
in
his
arm
-
chair
.
  
<EOS>
From
the
moment
in
which
he
had
first
become
convinced
that
the
election
would
go
against
him
,
and
that
he
was
therefore
ruined
on
all
sides
,
he
had
resolved
that
he
would
be
calm
amidst
his
ruin
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
he
assumed
a
little
smile
,
as
though
he
were
laughing
at
his
own
position
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bott
's
day
of
rejection
had
come
before
his
own
,
and
he
had
written
to
Mr.
Bott
a
drolling
note
of
consolation
and
mock
sympathy
.
<EOS>
He
had
shaken
hands
with
Mr.
Scruby
,
and
had
poked
his
fun
at
the
agent
,
bidding
him
be
sure
to
send
in
his
little
bill
soon
.
<EOS>
To
all
who
accosted
him
,
he
replied
in
a
subrisive
tone
;
and
he
bantered
Calder
Jones
,
whose
seat
was
quite
sure
,
till
Calder
Jones
began
to
have
fears
that
were
quite
unnecessary
.
<EOS>
And
now
,
as
he
sat
himself
down
,
intending
to
come
to
some
final
decision
as
to
what
he
would
do
,
he
maintained
the
same
calmness
.
<EOS>
He
smiled
in
the
same
way
,
though
there
was
no
one
there
to
see
the
smile
.
<EOS>
He
laughed
even
audibly
once
or
twice
,
as
he
vainly
endeavoured
to
persuade
himself
that
he
was
able
to
regard
the
world
and
all
that
belonged
to
it
as
a
bubble
.
  
<EOS>
There
came
to
him
a
moment
in
which
he
laughed
out
very
audibly
.
"
<EOS>
Ha
!
ha
!
"
<EOS>
he
shouted
,
rising
up
from
his
chair
,
and
he
walked
about
the
room
,
holding
a
large
paper
-
knife
in
his
hand
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ha
!
ha
!
<EOS>
"
Then
he
threw
the
knife
away
from
him
,
and
thrusting
his
hands
into
his
trousers
-
pockets
,
laughed

"
<EOS>
Ha
!
ha
!
"
<EOS>
He
stood
still
in
the
centre
of
the
room
,
and
the
laughter
was
very
plainly
visible
on
his
face
,
had
there
been
anybody
there
to
see
it
.
  
<EOS>
But
suddenly
there
was
a
change
upon
his
face
,
as
he
stood
there
all
alone
,
and
his
eyes
became
fierce
,
and
the
cicatrice
that
marred
his
countenance
grew
to
be
red
and
ghastly
,
and
he
grinned
with
his
teeth
,
and
he
clenched
his
fists
as
he
still
held
them
within
his
pockets
.
<EOS>
"
Curse
him
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
out
loud
.
"
<EOS>
Curse
him
,
now
and
for
ever
!
"
<EOS>
He
had
broken
down
in
his
calmness
,
when
he
thought
of
that
old
man
who
had
opposed
him
during
his
life
,
and
had
ruined
him
at
his
death
.
"
<EOS>
May
all
the
evils
which
the
dead
can
feel
cling
to
him
for
ever
and
ever
!
"
<EOS>
His
laughter
was
all
gone
,
and
his
assumed
tranquillity
had
deserted
him
.
<EOS>
Walking
across
the
room
,
he
struck
his
foot
against
a
chair
;
upon
this
,
he
took
the
chair
in
his
hands
,
and
threw
it
across
the
room
.
<EOS>
But
he
hardly
arrested
the
torrent
of
his
maledictions
as
he
did
so
.
<EOS>
What
good
was
it
that
he
should
lie
to
himself
by
that
mock
tranquillity
,
or
that
false
laughter
?
<EOS>
He
lied
to
himself
no
longer
,
but
uttered
a
song
of
despair
that
was
true
enough
.
<EOS>
What
should
he
do
?
<EOS>
Where
should
he
go
?
<EOS>
From
what
fountain
should
he
attempt
to
draw
such
small
draughts
of
the
water
of
comfort
as
might
support
him
at
the
present
moment
?
<EOS>
Unless
a
man
have
some
such
fountain
to
which
he
can
turn
,
the
burden
of
life
can
not
be
borne
.
<EOS>
For
the
moment
,
Vavasor
tried
to
find
such
fountain
in
a
bottle
of
brandy
which
stood
near
him
.
<EOS>
He
half
filled
a
tumbler
,
and
then
,
dashing
some
water
on
it
,
swallowed
it
greedily
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
By
 
---
!
"
he
said
,
"
I
believe
it
is
the
best
thing
a
man
can
do
.
"
  
<EOS>
But
where
was
he
to
go
?
<EOS>
to
whom
was
he
to
turn
himself
?
<EOS>
He
went
to
a
high
desk
which
stood
in
one
corner
of
the
room
,
and
unlocking
it
,
took
out
a
revolving
pistol
,
and
for
a
while
carried
it
about
with
him
in
his
hand
.
<EOS>
He
turned
it
up
,
and
looked
at
it
,
and
tried
the
lock
,
and
snapped
it
without
caps
,
to
see
that
the
barrel
went
round
fairly
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
beggarly
thing
to
do
,
"
he
said
,
and
then
he
turned
the
pistol
down
again
;
"
and
if
I
do
do
it
,
I
'll
use
it
first
for
another
purpose
.
<EOS>
"
Then
he
poured
out
for
himself
more
brandy
-
and
-
water
,
and
having
drunk
it
,
he
threw
himself
upon
the
sofa
,
and
seemed
to
sleep
.
  
<EOS>
But
he
did
not
sleep
,
and
by
-
and
-
by
there
came
a
slight
single
knock
at
the
door
,
which
he
instantly
answered
.
<EOS>
But
he
did
not
answer
it
in
the
usual
way
by
bidding
the
comer
to
come
in
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Who
's
there
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
.
<EOS>
Then
the
comer
attempted
to
enter
,
turning
the
handle
of
the
door
.
<EOS>
But
the
door
had
been
locked
,
and
the
key
was
on
Vavasor
's
side
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Who
's
there
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
again
,
speaking
out
loudly
,
but
in
an
angry
voice
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
I
,
"
said
a
woman
's
voice
.
<EOS>
"
D
 
---
ation
!
"
said
George
Vavasor
.
  
<EOS>
The
woman
heard
him
,
but
she
made
no
sign
of
having
heard
him
.
<EOS>
She
simply
remained
standing
where
she
was
till
something
further
should
be
done
within
.
<EOS>
She
knew
the
man
well
,
and
knew
that
she
must
bide
his
time
.
<EOS>
She
was
very
patient
,
 
and
for
the
time
was
meek
,
though
it
might
be
that
there
would
come
an
end
to
her
meekness
.
<EOS>
Vavasor
,
when
he
had
heard
her
voice
,
and
knew
who
was
there
,
had
again
thrown
himself
on
the
sofa
.
<EOS>
There
flashed
across
his
mind
another
thought
or
two
as
to
his
future
career
,
 
another
idea
about
the
pistol
,
which
still
lay
upon
the
table
.
<EOS>
Why
should
he
let
the
intruder
in
,
and
undergo
the
nuisance
of
a
disagreeable
interview
,
if
the
end
of
all
things
might
come
in
time
to
save
him
from
such
trouble
?
<EOS>
There
he
lay
for
ten
minutes
thinking
,
and
then
the
low
single
knock
was
heard
again
.
<EOS>
He
jumped
upon
his
feet
,
and
his
eyes
were
full
of
fire
.
<EOS>
He
knew
that
it
was
useless
to
bid
her
go
and
leave
him
.
<EOS>
She
would
sit
there
,
if
it
were
through
the
whole
night
.
<EOS>
Should
he
open
the
door
and
strangle
her
,
and
pass
out
over
her
with
the
pistol
in
his
hand
,
so
that
he
might
make
that
other
reckoning
which
he
desired
to
accomplish
,
and
then
never
come
back
any
more
?
  
<EOS>
He
took
a
turn
through
the
room
,
and
then
walked
gently
up
to
the
door
,
and
undid
the
lock
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
open
the
door
,
nor
did
he
bid
his
visitor
enter
,
but
having
made
the
way
easy
for
her
if
she
chose
to
come
in
,
he
walked
back
to
the
sofa
and
threw
himself
on
it
again
.
<EOS>
As
he
did
so
,
he
passed
his
hand
across
the
table
so
as
to
bring
the
pistol
near
to
himself
at
the
place
where
he
would
be
lying
.
<EOS>
She
paused
a
moment
after
she
had
heard
the
sound
of
the
key
,
and
then
she
made
her
way
into
the
room
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
at
first
speak
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
closed
the
door
very
gently
,
and
then
,
looking
around
,
came
up
to
the
foot
of
the
sofa
.
<EOS>
She
paused
a
moment
,
waiting
for
him
to
address
her
;
but
as
he
said
nothing
,
but
lay
there
looking
at
her
<EOS>
,
she
was
the
first
to
speak
.
"
<EOS>
George
,
"
she
said
,
"
what
am
I
to
do
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
was
a
woman
of
about
thirty
years
of
age
,
dressed
poorly
,
in
old
garments
,
but
still
with
decency
,
and
with
some
attempt
at
feminine
prettiness
.
<EOS>
There
were
flowers
in
the
bonnet
on
her
head
,
though
the
bonnet
had
that
unmistakable
look
of
age
which
is
quite
as
distressing
to
bonnets
as
it
is
to
women
,
and
the
flowers
themselves
were
battered
and
faded
.
<EOS>
She
had
long
black
ringlets
on
each
cheek
,
hanging
down
much
below
her
face
,
and
brought
forward
so
as
to
hide
in
some
degree
the
hollowness
of
her
jaws
.
<EOS>
Her
eyes
had
a
peculiar
brightness
,
but
now
they
left
on
those
who
looked
at
her
cursorily
no
special
impression
as
to
their
colour
.
<EOS>
They
had
been
blue
,
 
that
dark
violet
blue
,
which
is
so
rare
,
but
is
sometimes
so
lovely
.
<EOS>
Her
forehead
was
narrow
,
her
mouth
was
small
,
and
her
lips
were
thin
;
but
her
nose
was
perfect
in
its
shape
,
and
,
by
the
delicacy
of
its
modelling
,
had
given
a
peculiar
grace
to
her
face
in
the
days
when
things
had
gone
well
with
her
,
when
her
cheeks
had
been
full
with
youth
and
good
living
,
and
had
been
dimpled
by
the
softness
of
love
and
mirth
.
<EOS>
There
were
no
dimples
there
now
,
and
all
the
softness
which
still
remained
was
that
softness
which
sorrow
and
continual
melancholy
give
to
suffering
women
.
<EOS>
On
her
shoulders
she
wore
a
light
shawl
,
which
was
fastened
to
her
bosom
with
a
large
clasp
brooch
.
<EOS>
Her
faded
dress
was
supported
by
a
wide
crinoline
,
but
the
under
garment
had
lost
all
the
grace
of
its
ancient
shape
,
and
now
told
that
woman
's
tale
of
poverty
and
taste
for
dress
which
is
to
be
read
in
the
outward
garb
of
so
many
of
Eve
's
daughters
.
<EOS>
The
whole
story
was
told
so
that
those
who
ran
might
read
it
.
<EOS>
When
she
had
left
her
home
this
afternoon
,
she
had
struggled
hard
to
dress
herself
so
that
something
of
the
charm
of
apparel
might
be
left
to
her
;
but
she
had
known
of
her
own
failure
at
every
twist
that
she
had
given
to
her
gown
,
and
at
every
jerk
with
which
she
had
settled
her
shawl
.
<EOS>
She
had
despaired
at
every
push
she
had
given
to
her
old
flowers
,
vainly
striving
to
bring
them
back
to
their
old
forms
;
but
still
she
had
persevered
.
<EOS>
With
long
tedious
care
she
had
mended
the
old
gloves
which
would
hardly
hold
her
fingers
.
<EOS>
She
had
carefully
hidden
the
rags
of
her
sleeves
.
<EOS>
She
had
washed
her
little
shrivelled
collar
,
and
had
smoothed
it
out
painfully
.
<EOS>
It
had
been
a
separate
grief
to
her
that
she
could
find
no
cuffs
to
put
round
her
wrists
;
 
and
yet
she
knew
that
no
cuffs
could
have
availed
her
anything
.
<EOS>
Nothing
could
avail
her
now
.
<EOS>
She
expected
nothing
from
her
visit
;
yet
she
had
come
forth
anxiously
,
and
would
have
waited
there
throughout
the
whole
night
had
access
to
his
room
been
debarred
to
her
.
"
<EOS>
George
,
"
she
said
,
standing
at
the
bottom
of
the
sofa
,
"
what
am
I
to
do
?
"
  
<EOS>
As
he
lay
there
with
his
face
turned
towards
her
,
the
windows
were
at
her
back
,
and
he
could
see
her
very
plainly
.
<EOS>
He
saw
and
appreciated
the
little
struggles
she
had
made
to
create
by
her
appearance
some
reminiscence
of
her
former
self
.
<EOS>
He
saw
the
shining
coarseness
of
the
long
ringlets
which
had
once
been
softer
than
silk
.
<EOS>
He
saw
the
sixpenny
brooch
on
her
bosom
where
he
had
once
placed
a
jewel
,
the
price
of
which
would
now
have
been
important
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
saw
it
all
,
and
lay
there
for
a
while
,
silently
reading
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
let
me
stand
here
,
"
she
said
,
"
without
speaking
a
word
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
want
you
to
stand
there
,
"
he
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
all
very
well
,
George
.
<EOS>
I
know
you
do
n't
want
me
to
stand
here
.
<EOS>
I
know
you
do
n't
want
to
see
me
ever
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Never
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
it
.
<EOS>
Of
course
I
know
it
.
<EOS>
But
what
am
I
to
do
?
<EOS>
Where
am
I
to
go
for
money
?
<EOS>
Even
you
would
not
wish
that
I
should
starve
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
true
,
too
.
<EOS>
I
certainly
would
not
wish
it
.
<EOS>
I
should
be
delighted
to
hear
that
you
had
plenty
to
eat
and
plenty
to
drink
,
and
plenty
of
clothes
to
wear
.
<EOS>
I
believe
that
's
what
you
care
for
the
most
,
after
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
only
for
your
sake
,
 
because
you
liked
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
;
 
I
did
like
it
;
but
that
has
come
to
an
end
,
as
have
all
my
other
likings
.
<EOS>
You
know
very
well
that
I
can
do
nothing
more
for
you
.
<EOS>
What
good
do
you
do
yourself
by
coming
here
to
annoy
me
?
<EOS>
Have
I
not
told
you
over
and
over
again
that
you
were
never
to
look
for
me
here
?
<EOS>
Is
it
likely
that
I
should
give
you
money
now
,
simply
because
you
have
disobeyed
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Where
else
was
I
to
find
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
should
you
have
found
me
at
all
?
<EOS>
I
do
n't
want
you
to
find
me
.
<EOS>
I
shall
give
you
nothing
;
 
not
a
penny
.
<EOS>
You
know
very
well
that
we
've
had
all
that
out
before
.
<EOS>
When
I
put
you
into
business
I
told
you
that
we
were
to
see
no
more
of
each
other
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Business
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
never
could
make
enough
out
of
the
shop
to
feed
a
bird
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
was
n't
my
fault
.
<EOS>
Putting
you
there
cost
me
over
a
hundred
pounds
,
and
you
consented
to
take
the
place
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
consent
.
<EOS>
I
was
obliged
to
go
there
because
you
took
my
other
home
away
from
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Have
it
as
you
like
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
That
was
all
I
could
do
for
you
;
 
and
more
than
most
men
would
have
done
,
when
all
things
are
considered
.
"
<EOS>
Then
he
got
up
from
the
sofa
,
and
stood
himself
on
the
hearthrug
,
with
his
back
to
the
fireplace
.
<EOS>
"
At
any
rate
,
you
may
be
sure
of
this
,
Jane
;
 
that
I
shall
do
nothing
more
.
<EOS>
You
have
come
here
to
torment
me
,
but
you
shall
get
nothing
by
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
come
here
because
I
am
starving
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
nothing
for
you
.
<EOS>
Now
go
;
"
and
he
pointed
to
the
door
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
for
more
than
three
years
of
his
life
this
woman
had
been
his
closest
companion
,
his
nearest
friend
,
the
being
with
whom
he
was
most
familiar
.
<EOS>
He
had
loved
her
according
to
his
fashion
of
loving
,
and
certainly
she
had
loved
him
.
<EOS>
"
Go
,
"
he
said
repeating
the
word
very
angrily
.
<EOS>
"
Do
as
I
bid
you
,
or
it
will
be
the
worse
for
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
give
me
a
sovereign
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
 
I
will
give
you
nothing
.
<EOS>
I
have
desired
you
not
to
come
to
me
here
,
and
I
will
not
pay
for
you
coming
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
I
will
not
go
;
"
and
the
woman
sat
down
upon
a
chair
at
the
foot
of
the
table
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
go
till
you
have
given
me
something
to
buy
food
.
<EOS>
You
may
put
me
out
of
the
room
if
you
can
,
but
I
will
lie
at
the
door
of
the
stairs
.
<EOS>
And
if
you
get
me
out
of
the
house
,
I
will
sit
upon
the
door
-
step
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
play
that
game
,
my
poor
girl
,
the
police
will
take
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Let
them
.
<EOS>
It
has
come
to
that
with
me
,
that
I
care
for
nothing
.
<EOS>
Out
of
this
I
will
not
go
till
you
give
me
money
 
unless
I
am
put
out
.
"
  
<EOS>
And
for
this
she
had
dressed
herself
with
so
much
care
,
mending
her
gloves
,
and
darning
her
little
fragments
of
finery
!
<EOS>
He
stood
looking
at
her
,
with
his
hands
thrust
deep
into
his
pockets
,
 
looking
at
her
and
thinking
what
he
had
better
do
to
rid
himself
of
her
presence
.
<EOS>
If
he
even
quite
resolved
to
take
that
little
final
journey
of
which
we
have
spoken
,
with
the
pistol
in
his
hand
,
why
should
he
not
go
and
leave
her
there
?
<EOS>
Or
,
for
the
matter
of
that
,
why
should
he
not
make
her
his
heir
to
all
remainder
of
his
wealth
?
<EOS>
What
he
still
had
left
was
sufficient
to
place
her
in
a
seventh
heaven
of
the
earth
.
<EOS>
He
cared
but
little
for
her
,
and
was
at
this
moment
angry
with
her
;
but
there
was
no
one
for
whom
he
cared
more
,
and
no
friend
with
whom
he
was
less
angry
.
<EOS>
But
then
his
mind
was
not
quite
made
up
as
to
that
final
journey
.
<EOS>
Therefore
he
desired
to
rid
himself
and
his
room
of
the
nuisance
of
her
presence
.
  
<EOS>
"
Jane
,
"
he
said
,
looking
at
her
again
with
that
assumed
tranquillity
of
which
I
have
spoken
,
"
you
talk
of
starving
and
of
being
ruined
,
 
"
  
"
I
am
starving
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
a
shilling
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
it
may
be
a
comfort
to
you
in
your
troubles
to
know
that
I
am
,
at
any
rate
,
as
badly
off
as
you
are
?
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
say
that
I
am
starving
,
because
I
could
get
food
to
eat
at
this
moment
if
I
wanted
it
;
but
I
am
utterly
ruined
.
<EOS>
My
property
,
 
what
should
have
been
mine
,
 
has
been
left
away
from
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
lost
the
trumpery
seat
in
Parliament
for
which
I
have
paid
so
much
.
<EOS>
All
my
relations
have
turned
their
backs
upon
me
 
"
  
"
Are
you
not
going
to
be
married
?
<EOS>
"
she
said
,
rising
quickly
from
her
chair
and
coming
close
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Married
!
<EOS>
No
;
 
<EOS>
but
I
am
going
to
blow
my
brains
out
.
<EOS>
Look
at
that
pistol
,
my
girl
.
<EOS>
Of
course
you
wo
n't
think
that
I
am
in
earnest
,
 
but
I
am
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
looked
up
into
his
face
piteously
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
George
,
"
she
said
,
"
you
wo
n't
do
that
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
shall
do
that
.
<EOS>
There
is
nothing
else
left
for
me
to
do
.
<EOS>
You
talk
to
me
about
starving
.
<EOS>
I
tell
you
that
I
should
have
no
objection
to
be
starved
,
and
so
be
put
an
end
to
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
It
's
not
so
bad
as
some
other
ways
when
it
comes
gradually
.
<EOS>
You
and
I
,
Jane
,
have
not
played
our
cards
very
well
.
<EOS>
We
have
staked
all
that
we
had
,
and
we
've
been
beaten
.
<EOS>
It
's
no
good
whimpering
after
what
's
lost
.
<EOS>
We
'd
better
go
somewhere
else
and
begin
a
new
game
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Go
where
?
"
said
she
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
 
<EOS>
that
's
just
what
I
ca
n't
tell
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
George
,
"
she
said
,
"
I
'll
go
anywhere
with
you
.
<EOS>
If
what
you
say
is
true
,
 
if
you
're
not
going
to
be
married
,
and
will
let
me
come
to
you
,
I
will
work
for
you
like
a
slave
.
<EOS>
I
will
indeed
.
<EOS>
I
know
I
'm
poorly
looking
now
 
"
  
"
My
girl
,
where
I
'm
going
,
I
shall
not
want
any
slave
;
and
as
for
your
looks
 
when
you
go
there
too
,
 
<EOS>
they
'll
be
of
no
matter
,
as
far
as
I
am
able
to
judge
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
George
,
where
are
you
going
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Wherever
people
do
go
when
their
brains
are
knocked
out
of
them
;
or
,
rather
,
when
they
have
knocked
out
their
own
brains
,
 
if
that
makes
any
difference
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
George
,
"
 
she
came
up
to
him
now
,
and
took
hold
of
him
by
the
front
of
his
coat
,
and
for
the
moment
he
allowed
her
to
do
so
,
 
"
George
,
you
frighten
me
.
<EOS>
Do
not
do
that
.
<EOS>
Say
that
you
will
not
do
that
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
am
just
saying
that
I
shall
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
not
afraid
of
God
's
anger
?
<EOS>
You
and
I
have
been
very
wicked
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
,
my
poor
girl
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
much
about
your
wickedness
.
<EOS>
I
've
been
like
Topsy
;
 
<EOS>
indeed
I
am
a
kind
of
second
Topsy
myself
.
<EOS>
But
what
's
the
good
of
whimpering
when
it
's
over
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
n't
over
;
it
is
n't
over
,
 
at
any
rate
for
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
knew
how
I
could
begin
again
.
<EOS>
But
all
this
is
nonsense
,
Jane
,
and
you
must
go
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
tell
me
,
first
,
that
you
are
not
going
to
 
kill
yourself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
suppose
I
shall
do
it
to
-
night
,
 
or
,
perhaps
,
not
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
Very
probably
I
may
allow
myself
a
week
,
so
that
your
staying
here
can
do
no
good
.
<EOS>
I
merely
wanted
to
make
you
understand
that
you
are
not
the
only
person
who
has
come
to
grief
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
are
not
going
to
be
married
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
I
'm
not
going
to
be
married
,
certainly
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
I
must
go
now
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
I
think
you
'd
better
go
now
.
<EOS>
"
Then
she
rose
and
went
,
and
he
let
her
leave
the
room
without
giving
her
a
shilling
!
<EOS>
His
bantering
tone
,
in
speaking
of
his
own
position
,
had
been
successful
.
<EOS>
It
had
caused
her
to
take
herself
off
quietly
.
<EOS>
She
knew
enough
of
his
usual
manner
to
be
aware
that
his
threats
of
self
destruction
were
probably
unreal
;
but
,
nevertheless
,
what
he
had
said
had
created
some
feeling
in
her
heart
which
had
induced
her
to
yield
to
him
,
and
go
away
in
peace
.
   
<EOS>
Showing
How
George
Vavasor
Paid
a
Visit
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
nearly
seven
o'clock
in
the
evening
,
 
a
hot
,
July
evening
,
 
when
the
woman
went
from
Vavasor
's
room
,
and
left
him
there
alone
.
<EOS>
It
was
necessary
that
he
should
immediately
do
something
.
<EOS>
In
the
first
place
he
must
dine
,
unless
he
meant
to
carry
out
his
threat
,
and
shoot
himself
at
once
.
<EOS>
But
he
had
no
such
intention
as
that
,
although
he
stood
for
some
minutes
with
the
pistol
in
his
hand
.
<EOS>
He
was
thinking
then
of
shooting
some
one
else
.
<EOS>
But
he
resolved
that
,
if
he
did
so
at
all
,
he
would
not
do
it
on
that
evening
,
and
he
locked
up
the
pistol
again
in
the
standing
desk
.
<EOS>
After
that
,
he
took
up
some
papers
,
referring
to
steam
packets
,
which
were
lying
on
his
table
.
<EOS>
They
contained
the
programmes
of
different
companies
,
and
showed
how
one
vessel
went
on
one
day
to
New
York
,
and
another
on
another
day
would
take
out
a
load
of
emigrants
for
New
Zealand
and
Australia
.
<EOS>
"
That
's
a
good
line
,
"
said
he
,
as
he
read
a
certain
prospectus
.
<EOS>
"
They
generally
go
to
the
bottom
,
and
save
a
man
from
any
further
trouble
on
his
own
account
.
<EOS>
"
Then
he
dressed
himself
,
putting
on
his
boots
and
coat
,
and
went
out
to
his
club
for
his
dinner
.
  
<EOS>
London
was
still
fairly
full
,
 
that
is
to
say
,
the
West
End
was
not
deserted
,
although
Parliament
had
been
broken
up
two
months
earlier
than
usual
,
in
preparation
for
the
new
elections
.
<EOS>
Many
men
who
had
gone
down
into
the
country
were
now
back
again
in
town
,
and
the
dining
-
room
at
the
club
was
crowded
.
<EOS>
Men
came
up
to
him
condoling
with
him
,
telling
him
that
he
was
well
rid
of
a
great
nuisance
,
that
the
present
Members
for
the
Chelsea
Districts
would
not
sit
long
,
or
that
there
would
be
another
general
election
in
a
year
or
two
.
<EOS>
To
all
these
little
speeches
he
made
cheerful
replies
,
and
was
declared
by
his
acquaintance
to
bear
his
disappointment
well
.
<EOS>
Calder
Jones
came
to
him
and
talked
hunting
talk
,
and
Vavasor
expressed
his
intention
of
being
at
Roebury
in
November
.
<EOS>
"
You
had
better
join
our
club
,
"
said
Calder
Jones
.
<EOS>
In
answer
to
which
Vavasor
said
that
he
thought
he
would
join
the
club
.
<EOS>
He
remained
in
the
smoking
-
room
till
nearly
eleven
;
then
he
took
himself
home
,
and
remained
up
half
the
night
destroying
papers
.
<EOS>
Every
written
document
on
which
he
could
lay
his
hands
he
destroyed
.
<EOS>
All
the
pigeon
-
holes
of
his
desk
were
emptied
out
,
and
their
contents
thrown
into
the
flames
.
<EOS>
At
first
he
looked
at
the
papers
before
he
burned
them
;
but
the
trouble
of
doing
so
soon
tired
him
,
and
he
condemned
them
all
,
as
he
came
to
them
,
without
examination
.
<EOS>
Then
he
selected
a
considerable
amount
of
his
clothes
,
and
packed
up
two
portmanteaus
,
folding
his
coats
with
care
,
and
inspecting
his
boots
narrowly
,
so
that
he
might
see
which
,
out
of
the
large
number
before
him
,
it
might
be
best
worth
his
while
to
take
with
him
.
<EOS>
When
that
was
done
,
he
took
from
his
desk
a
bag
of
sovereigns
,
and
,
pouring
them
out
upon
the
table
,
he
counted
them
out
into
parcels
of
twenty
-
five
each
,
and
made
them
up
carefully
into
rouleaus
with
paper
.
<EOS>
These
,
when
complete
,
he
divided
among
the
two
portmanteaus
and
a
dressing
-
bag
which
he
also
packed
and
a
travelling
desk
,
which
he
filled
with
papers
,
pens
,
and
the
like
.
<EOS>
But
he
put
into
it
no
written
document
.
<EOS>
He
carefully
looked
through
his
linen
,
and
anything
that
had
been
marked
with
more
than
his
initials
he
rejected
.
<EOS>
Then
he
took
out
a
bundle
of
printed
cards
,
and
furnished
a
card
-
case
with
them
.
<EOS>
On
these
cards
was
inscribed
the
name
of
Gregory
Vance
.
<EOS>
When
all
was
finished
,
he
stood
for
awhile
with
his
back
to
the
fireplace
contemplating
his
work
.
<EOS>
"
After
all
,
"
he
said
to
himself
,
"
I
know
that
I
shall
never
start
;
and
,
if
I
do
,
nobody
can
hinder
me
,
and
my
own
name
would
be
as
good
as
any
other
.
<EOS>
As
for
a
man
with
such
a
face
as
mine
not
being
known
,
that
is
out
of
the
question
.
<EOS>
"
But
still
he
liked
the
arrangements
which
he
had
made
,
and
when
he
had
looked
at
them
for
awhile
he
went
to
bed
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
up
early
the
next
morning
,
and
had
some
coffee
brought
to
him
by
the
servant
of
the
house
,
and
as
he
drank
it
he
had
an
interview
with
his
landlady
.
<EOS>
"
He
was
going
,
"
he
said
;
 
"
going
that
very
day
.
<EOS>
"
It
might
be
possible
that
he
would
change
his
mind
;
but
as
he
would
desire
to
start
without
delay
,
if
he
did
go
,
he
would
pay
her
then
what
he
owed
her
,
and
what
would
be
due
for
her
lodgings
under
a
week
's
notice
.
<EOS>
The
woman
stared
,
and
curtseyed
,
and
took
her
money
.
<EOS>
Vavasor
,
though
he
had
lately
been
much
pressed
for
money
,
had
never
been
so
foolish
as
to
owe
debts
where
he
lived
.
<EOS>
"
There
will
be
some
things
left
about
,
Mrs.
Bunsby
,
"
he
said
,
"
and
I
will
get
you
to
keep
them
till
I
call
or
send
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bunsby
said
that
she
would
,
and
then
looked
her
last
at
him
.
<EOS>
After
that
interview
she
never
saw
him
again
.
  
<EOS>
When
he
was
left
alone
he
put
on
a
rough
morning
coat
,
and
taking
up
the
pistol
,
placed
it
carefully
in
his
pocket
,
and
sallied
forth
.
<EOS>
It
was
manifest
enough
that
he
had
some
decided
scheme
in
his
head
,
for
he
turned
quickly
towards
the
West
when
he
reached
the
Strand
,
went
across
Trafalgar
Square
to
Pall
Mall
East
,
and
then
turned
up
Suffolk
Street
.
<EOS>
Just
as
he
reached
the
club
-
house
at
the
corner
he
paused
and
looked
back
,
facing
first
one
way
<EOS>
and
then
the
other
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
chances
are
that
I
shall
never
see
anything
of
it
again
,
"
he
said
to
himself
.
<EOS>
Then
he
laughed
in
his
own
silent
way
,
shook
his
head
slightly
,
and
turning
again
quickly
on
his
heel
,
walked
up
the
street
till
he
reached
the
house
of
Mr.
Jones
,
the
pugilistic
tailor
.
<EOS>
The
reader
,
no
doubt
,
has
forgotten
all
he
ever
knew
of
Mr.
Jones
,
the
pugilistic
tailor
.
<EOS>
It
can
soon
be
told
again
.
<EOS>
At
Mr.
Jones
's
house
John
Grey
lodged
when
he
was
in
London
,
and
he
was
in
London
at
this
moment
.
  
<EOS>
Vavasor
rang
the
bell
,
and
as
soon
as
the
servant
came
he
went
quickly
into
the
house
,
and
passed
her
in
the
passage
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Grey
is
at
home
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
go
up
to
him
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
girl
said
that
Mr.
Grey
was
at
home
,
but
suggested
that
she
had
better
announce
the
gentleman
.
<EOS>
But
Vavasor
was
already
halfway
up
the
stairs
,
and
before
the
girl
had
reached
the
first
landing
place
,
he
had
entered
Mr.
Grey
's
room
and
closed
the
door
behind
him
.
  
<EOS>
Grey
was
sitting
near
the
open
window
,
in
a
dressing
-
gown
,
and
was
reading
.
<EOS>
The
breakfast
things
were
on
the
table
,
but
he
had
not
as
yet
breakfasted
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
he
saw
George
Vavasor
,
he
rose
from
his
chair
quickly
,
and
put
down
his
book
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Vavasor
,
"
he
said
,
"
I
hardly
expected
to
see
you
in
my
lodgings
again
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
dare
say
not
,
"
said
Vavasor
;
"
<EOS>
but
,
nevertheless
,
here
I
am
.
"
<EOS>
He
kept
his
right
hand
in
the
pocket
which
held
the
pistol
,
and
held
his
left
hand
under
his
waistcoat
.
  
<EOS>
"
May
I
ask
why
you
have
come
?
"
said
Grey
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
intend
to
tell
you
,
at
any
rate
,
whether
you
ask
me
or
not
.
<EOS>
I
have
come
to
declare
in
your
own
hearing
,
 
as
I
am
in
the
habit
of
doing
occasionally
behind
your
back
,
 
that
you
are
a
blackguard
,
 
to
spit
in
your
face
,
and
defy
you
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
he
said
this
he
suited
his
action
to
his
words
,
but
without
any
serious
result
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
come
here
to
see
if
you
are
man
enough
to
resent
any
insult
that
I
can
offer
you
;
but
I
doubt
whether
you
are
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nothing
that
you
can
say
to
me
,
Mr.
Vavasor
,
will
have
any
effect
upon
me
;
 
except
that
you
can
,
of
course
,
annoy
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
mean
to
annoy
you
,
too
,
before
I
have
done
with
you
.
<EOS>
Will
you
fight
me
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Fight
a
duel
with
you
,
 
with
pistols
?
<EOS>
Certainly
not
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
you
are
a
coward
,
as
I
supposed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
be
a
fool
if
I
were
to
do
such
a
thing
as
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Look
here
,
Mr.
Grey
.
<EOS>
You
managed
to
worm
yourself
into
an
intimacy
with
my
cousin
,
Miss
Vavasor
,
and
to
become
engaged
to
her
.
<EOS>
When
she
found
out
what
you
were
,
how
paltry
,
and
mean
,
and
vile
,
she
changed
her
mind
,
and
bade
you
leave
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
here
at
her
request
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
here
as
her
representative
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Self
-
appointed
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
,
sir
,
you
think
wrong
.
<EOS>
I
am
at
this
moment
her
affianced
husband
;
and
I
find
that
,
in
spite
of
all
that
she
has
said
to
you
,
 
which
was
enough
,
I
should
have
thought
,
to
keep
any
man
of
spirit
out
of
her
presence
,
 
you
still
persecute
her
by
going
to
her
house
,
and
forcing
yourself
upon
her
presence
.
<EOS>
Now
,
I
give
you
two
alternatives
.
<EOS>
You
shall
either
give
me
your
written
promise
never
to
go
near
her
again
,
or
you
shall
fight
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
do
neither
one
nor
the
other
,
 
as
you
know
very
well
yourself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Stop
till
I
have
done
,
sir
.
<EOS>
If
you
have
courage
enough
to
fight
me
,
I
will
meet
you
in
any
country
.
<EOS>
I
will
fight
you
here
in
London
,
or
,
if
you
are
afraid
of
that
,
I
will
go
over
to
France
,
or
to
America
,
if
that
will
suit
you
better
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nothing
of
the
kind
will
suit
me
at
all
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
want
to
have
anything
to
do
with
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
you
are
a
coward
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
I
am
;
 
but
<EOS>
your
saying
so
will
not
make
me
one
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
a
coward
,
and
a
liar
,
and
a
blackguard
.
<EOS>
I
have
given
you
the
option
of
behaving
like
a
gentleman
,
and
you
have
refused
it
.
<EOS>
Now
,
look
here
.
<EOS>
I
have
come
here
with
arms
,
and
I
do
not
intend
to
leave
this
room
without
using
them
,
unless
you
will
promise
to
give
me
the
meeting
that
I
have
proposed
.
"
<EOS>
And
he
took
the
pistol
out
of
his
pocket
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
mean
that
you
are
going
to
murder
me
?
"
<EOS>
Grey
asked
.
<EOS>
There
were
two
windows
in
the
room
,
and
he
had
been
sitting
near
to
that
which
was
furthest
removed
from
the
fireplace
,
and
consequently
furthest
removed
from
the
bell
,
and
his
visitor
was
now
standing
immediately
between
him
and
the
door
.
<EOS>
He
had
to
think
what
steps
he
might
best
take
,
and
to
act
upon
his
decision
instantly
.
<EOS>
He
was
by
no
means
a
timid
man
,
and
was
one
,
moreover
,
very
little
prone
to
believe
in
extravagant
action
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
think
,
even
now
,
that
this
disappointed
,
ruined
man
had
come
there
with
any
intention
of
killing
him
.
<EOS>
But
he
knew
that
a
pistol
in
the
hands
of
an
angry
man
is
dangerous
,
and
that
it
behoved
him
to
do
his
best
to
rid
himself
of
the
nuisance
which
now
encumbered
him
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Do
you
mean
that
you
are
going
to
murder
me
?
<EOS>
"
he
had
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
mean
that
you
shall
not
leave
this
room
alive
unless
you
promise
to
meet
me
,
and
fight
it
out
.
"
<EOS>
Upon
hearing
this
,
Grey
turned
himself
towards
the
bell
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
move
a
step
,
I
will
fire
at
you
,
"
said
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
Grey
paused
a
moment
,
and
looked
him
full
in
the
face
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
,
"
said
Vavasor
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
would
be
murder
,
"
said
Grey
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
think
that
you
will
frighten
me
by
ugly
words
,
"
said
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
beyond
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
Grey
had
stopped
for
a
moment
to
fix
his
eyes
on
the
other
man
's
face
;
but
it
was
only
for
a
moment
,
and
then
he
went
on
to
the
bell
.
<EOS>
He
had
seen
that
the
pistol
was
pointed
at
himself
,
and
had
once
thought
of
rushing
across
the
room
at
his
adversary
,
calculating
that
a
shot
fired
at
him
as
he
did
so
might
miss
him
,
and
that
he
would
then
have
a
fair
chance
of
disarming
the
madman
.
<EOS>
But
his
chief
object
was
to
avoid
any
personal
conflict
,
to
escape
the
indignity
of
a
scramble
for
the
pistol
,
 
and
especially
to
escape
the
necessity
of
a
consequent
appearance
at
some
police
-
office
,
where
he
would
have
to
justify
himself
,
and
answer
the
questions
of
a
lawyer
hired
to
cross
-
question
him
.
<EOS>
He
made
,
therefore
,
towards
the
bell
,
trusting
that
Vavasor
would
not
fire
at
him
,
but
having
some
little
thought
also
as
to
the
danger
of
the
moment
.
<EOS>
It
might
be
that
everything
was
over
for
him
now
,
 
that
the
fatal
hour
had
come
,
and
that
eternity
was
close
upon
him
.
<EOS>
Something
of
the
spirit
of
a
prayer
flashed
across
his
mind
as
he
moved
.
<EOS>
Then
he
heard
the
click
of
the
pistol
's
hammer
as
it
fell
,
and
was
aware
that
his
eyes
were
dazzled
,
though
he
was
unconscious
of
seeing
any
flame
.
<EOS>
He
felt
something
in
the
air
,
and
knew
that
the
pistol
had
been
fired
;
 
but
he
did
not
know
whether
the
shot
had
struck
him
or
had
missed
him
.
<EOS>
His
hand
was
out
for
the
bell
-
handle
,
and
he
had
pulled
it
,
before
he
was
sure
that
he
was
unhurt
.
  
<EOS>
"
D
 
---
ation
!
"
exclaimed
the
murderer
.
<EOS>
But
he
did
not
pull
the
trigger
again
.
<EOS>
Though
the
weapon
had
of
late
been
so
often
in
his
hands
,
he
forgot
,
in
the
agitation
of
the
moment
,
that
his
missing
once
was
but
of
small
matter
if
he
chose
to
go
on
with
his
purpose
.
<EOS>
Were
there
not
five
other
barrels
for
him
,
each
making
itself
ready
by
the
discharge
of
the
other
?
<EOS>
But
he
had
paused
,
forgetting
,
in
his
excitement
,
the
use
of
his
weapon
,
and
before
he
had
bethought
himself
that
the
man
was
still
in
his
power
,
he
heard
the
sound
of
the
bell
.
<EOS>
"
D
 
---
ation
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
.
<EOS>
Then
he
turned
round
,
left
the
room
,
hurried
down
the
stairs
,
and
made
his
way
out
into
the
street
,
having
again
passed
the
girl
on
his
way
.
  
<EOS>
Grey
,
when
he
perceived
that
his
enemy
was
gone
,
turned
round
to
look
for
the
bullet
or
its
mark
.
<EOS>
He
soon
found
the
little
hole
in
the
window
-
shutter
,
and
probing
it
with
the
point
of
his
pencil
,
came
upon
the
morsel
of
lead
which
might
now
just
as
readily
have
been
within
his
own
brain
.
<EOS>
There
he
left
it
for
the
time
,
and
then
made
some
not
inaccurate
calculation
as
to
the
narrowness
of
his
own
escape
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
standing
directly
between
Vavasor
and
the
shutter
,
and
he
found
,
from
the
height
of
the
hole
,
that
the
shot
must
have
passed
close
beneath
his
ear
.
<EOS>
He
remembered
to
have
heard
the
click
of
the
hammer
,
but
he
could
not
remember
the
sound
of
the
report
,
and
when
the
girl
entered
the
room
,
he
perceived
at
once
from
her
manner
that
she
was
unaware
that
firearms
had
been
used
.
  
<EOS>
"
Has
that
gentleman
left
the
house
?
"
<EOS>
Grey
asked
.
<EOS>
The
girl
said
that
he
had
left
the
house
.
"
<EOS>
Do
n't
admit
him
again
,
"
said
he
;
 
"
that
is
,
if
you
can
avoid
it
.
<EOS>
I
believe
he
is
not
in
his
right
senses
.
<EOS>
"
Then
he
asked
for
Mr.
Jones
,
his
landlord
,
and
in
a
few
minutes
the
pugilistic
tailor
was
with
him
.
  
<EOS>
During
those
few
minutes
he
had
been
called
upon
to
resolve
what
he
would
do
now
.
<EOS>
Would
he
put
the
police
at
once
upon
the
track
of
the
murderer
,
who
was
,
as
he
remembered
too
well
,
the
first
cousin
of
the
woman
whom
he
still
desired
to
make
his
wife
?
<EOS>
That
cross
-
examination
which
he
would
have
to
undergo
at
the
police
-
office
,
and
again
probably
in
an
assize
court
,
in
which
all
his
relations
with
the
Vavasor
family
would
be
made
public
,
was
very
vivid
to
his
imagination
.
<EOS>
That
he
was
called
upon
by
duty
to
do
something
he
felt
almost
assured
.
<EOS>
The
man
who
had
been
allowed
to
make
such
an
attempt
once
with
impunity
,
might
probably
make
it
again
.
<EOS>
But
he
resolved
that
he
need
not
now
say
anything
about
the
pistol
to
the
pugilistic
tailor
,
unless
the
tailor
said
something
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Jones
,
"
he
said
,
"
that
man
whom
I
had
to
put
out
of
the
room
once
before
,
has
been
here
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Has
there
been
another
tussle
,
sir
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
 
nothing
of
that
kind
.
<EOS>
But
we
must
take
some
steps
to
prevent
his
getting
in
again
,
if
we
can
help
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Jones
promised
his
aid
,
and
offered
to
go
at
once
to
the
police
.
<EOS>
To
this
,
however
,
Mr.
Grey
demurred
,
saying
that
he
should
himself
seek
assistance
from
some
magistrate
.
<EOS>
Jones
promised
to
be
very
vigilant
as
to
watching
the
door
;
and
then
John
Grey
sat
down
to
his
breakfast
.
<EOS>
Of
course
he
thought
much
of
what
had
occurred
.
<EOS>
It
was
impossible
that
he
should
not
think
much
of
so
narrow
an
escape
.
<EOS>
He
had
probably
been
as
near
death
as
a
man
may
well
be
without
receiving
any
injury
;
and
the
more
he
thought
of
it
,
the
more
strongly
he
was
convinced
that
he
could
not
allow
the
thing
to
pass
by
without
some
notice
,
or
some
precaution
as
to
the
future
.
  
<EOS>
At
eleven
o'clock
he
went
to
Scotland
Yard
,
and
saw
some
officer
great
in
power
over
policemen
,
and
told
him
all
the
circumstances
,
 
confidentially
.
<EOS>
The
powerful
officer
recommended
an
equally
confidential
reference
to
a
magistrate
;
and
towards
evening
a
very
confidential
policeman
in
plain
clothes
paid
a
visit
to
Vavasor
's
lodgings
in
Cecil
Street
.
<EOS>
But
Vavasor
lodged
there
no
longer
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bunsby
,
who
was
also
very
confidential
,
 
and
at
her
wits
'
end
because
she
could
not
learn
the
special
business
of
the
stranger
who
called
<EOS>
,
 
stated
that
Mr.
George
Vavasor
left
her
house
in
a
cab
at
ten
o'clock
that
morning
,
having
taken
with
him
such
luggage
as
he
had
packed
,
and
having
gone
,
"
she
was
afraid
,
for
good
,
"
as
Mrs.
Bunsby
expressed
it
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
gone
for
good
,
and
at
the
moment
in
which
the
policeman
was
making
the
inquiry
in
Cecil
Street
,
was
leaning
over
the
side
of
an
American
steamer
which
had
just
got
up
her
steam
and
weighed
her
anchor
in
the
Mersey
.
<EOS>
He
was
on
board
at
six
o'clock
,
and
it
was
not
till
the
next
day
that
the
cabman
was
traced
who
had
carried
him
to
Euston
Square
Station
.
<EOS>
Of
course
,
it
was
soon
known
that
he
had
gone
to
America
,
but
it
was
not
thought
worth
while
to
take
any
further
steps
towards
arresting
him
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Grey
himself
was
decidedly
opposed
to
any
such
attempt
,
declaring
his
opinion
that
his
own
evidence
would
be
insufficient
to
obtain
a
conviction
.
<EOS>
The
big
men
in
Scotland
Yard
were
loth
to
let
the
matter
drop
.
<EOS>
Their
mouths
watered
after
the
job
,
and
they
had
very
numerous
and
very
confidential
interviews
with
John
Grey
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
decided
that
nothing
should
be
done
.
"
<EOS>
Pity
!
"
said
one
enterprising
superintendent
,
in
answer
to
the
condolings
of
a
brother
superintendent
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Pity
's
no
name
for
it
.
<EOS>
It
's
the
greatest
shame
as
ever
<EOS>
I
knew
since
I
joined
the
force
.
<EOS>
A
man
as
was
a
Member
of
Parliament
only
last
Session
,
 
as
belongs
to
no
end
of
swell
clubs
,
a
gent
as
well
known
in
London
as
any
gent
about
the
town
!
<EOS>
And
I
'd
have
had
him
back
in
three
months
,
as
sure
as
my
name
's
Walker
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
that
superintendent
felt
that
his
profession
and
his
country
were
alike
disgraced
.
  
<EOS>
And
now
George
Vavasor
vanishes
from
our
pages
,
and
will
be
heard
of
no
more
.
<EOS>
Roebury
knew
him
no
longer
,
nor
Pall
Mall
,
nor
the
Chelsea
Districts
.
<EOS>
His
disappearance
was
a
nine
days
"
wonder
,
but
the
world
at
large
knew
nothing
of
the
circumstances
of
that
attempt
in
Suffolk
Street
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Grey
himself
told
the
story
to
no
one
,
till
he
told
it
to
Mr.
Palliser
at
Lucerne
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Scruby
complained
bitterly
of
the
way
in
which
Vavasor
had
robbed
him
;
but
I
doubt
whether
Scruby
,
in
truth
,
lost
much
by
the
transaction
.
<EOS>
To
Kate
,
down
in
Westmoreland
,
no
tidings
came
of
her
brother
,
and
her
sojourn
in
London
with
her
aunt
had
nearly
come
to
an
end
before
she
knew
that
he
was
gone
.
<EOS>
Even
then
the
rumour
reached
her
through
Captain
Bellfield
,
and
she
learned
what
few
facts
she
knew
from
Mrs.
Bunsby
in
Cecil
Street
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
was
always
mysterious
,
"
said
Mrs.
Greenow
,
"
and
now
he
has
vanished
.
<EOS>
I
hate
mysteries
,
and
,
as
for
myself
,
I
think
it
will
be
much
better
that
he
should
not
come
back
again
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Perhaps
Kate
was
of
the
same
opinion
,
but
,
if
so
,
she
kept
it
to
herself
.
   
<EOS>
In
Which
Come
Tidings
of
Great
Moment
to
All
Pallisers
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
till
they
had
been
for
a
day
or
two
together
at
Lucerne
that
Mr.
Grey
told
Mr.
Palliser
the
story
of
George
Vavasor
's
visit
to
him
in
Suffolk
Street
.
<EOS>
Having
begun
the
history
of
his
connection
with
Alice
,
he
found
himself
obliged
to
go
with
it
to
the
end
,
and
as
he
described
the
way
in
which
the
man
had
vanished
from
the
sight
of
all
who
had
known
him
,
 
that
he
had
in
truth
gone
,
so
as
no
longer
to
be
a
cause
of
dread
,
he
could
not
without
dissimulation
,
keep
back
the
story
of
that
last
scene
.
"
<EOS>
And
he
tried
to
murder
you
!
"
said
Mr.
Palliser
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
should
be
caught
and
,
 
and
 
"
Mr.
Palliser
hesitated
,
not
liking
to
say
boldly
that
the
first
cousin
of
the
lady
who
was
now
living
with
him
ought
to
be
hung
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
better
as
it
is
,
"
said
Grey
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
actually
walked
into
your
rooms
in
the
day
time
,
and
fired
a
pistol
at
you
as
you
were
sitting
at
your
breakfast
!
<EOS>
He
did
that
in
London
,
and
then
walked
off
and
went
abroad
,
as
though
he
had
nothing
to
fear
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
was
just
it
,
"
said
Grey
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
began
to
think
that
something
ought
to
be
done
to
make
life
more
secure
in
the
metropolis
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
Had
he
not
known
Mr.
Grey
,
or
been
accustomed
to
see
the
other
man
in
Parliament
,
he
would
not
have
thought
so
much
about
it
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
almost
too
much
for
him
when
he
reflected
that
one
man
whom
he
now
called
his
friend
,
had
been
nearly
murdered
in
daylight
,
in
the
heart
of
his
own
part
of
London
,
by
another
man
whom
he
had
reckoned
among
his
Parliamentary
supporters
.
"
<EOS>
And
he
has
got
your
money
too
!
"
<EOS>
said
Palliser
,
putting
all
the
circumstances
of
the
case
together
.
<EOS>
In
answer
to
this
Mr.
Grey
said
that
he
hoped
the
loss
might
eventually
be
his
own
;
but
that
he
was
bound
to
regard
the
money
which
had
been
taken
as
part
of
Miss
Vavasor
's
fortune
.
"
<EOS>
He
is
simply
the
greatest
miscreant
of
whom
I
ever
heard
in
my
life
,
"
said
Mr.
Palliser
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
wonder
is
that
Miss
Vavasor
should
ever
have
brought
herself
to
 
to
like
him
.
"
<EOS>
Then
Mr.
Grey
apologized
for
Alice
,
explaining
that
her
love
for
her
cousin
had
come
from
her
early
years
;
that
the
man
himself
was
clever
and
capable
of
assuming
pleasant
ways
,
and
that
he
had
not
been
wholly
bad
till
ruin
had
come
upon
him
.
"
<EOS>
He
attempted
public
life
and
made
himself
miserable
by
failing
,
as
most
men
do
who
make
that
attempt
,
"
said
Grey
.
<EOS>
This
was
a
statement
which
Mr.
Palliser
could
not
allow
to
pass
without
notice
.
<EOS>
Whereupon
the
two
men
got
away
from
George
Vavasor
and
their
own
individual
interests
,
and
went
on
seriously
discussing
the
merits
and
demerits
of
public
life
.
<EOS>
"
The
end
of
it
all
is
,
"
said
Grey
at
last
,
"
that
public
men
in
England
should
be
rich
like
you
,
and
not
poor
like
that
miserable
wretch
,
who
has
now
lost
everything
that
the
Fates
had
given
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
They
continued
to
live
at
Lucerne
in
this
way
for
a
fortnight
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Grey
,
though
he
was
not
unfrequently
alone
with
Alice
,
did
not
plead
his
suit
in
direct
words
;
but
continued
to
live
with
her
on
terms
of
close
and
easy
friendship
.
<EOS>
He
had
told
her
that
her
cousin
had
left
England
,
 
that
he
had
gone
to
America
immediately
after
his
disappointment
in
regard
to
the
seat
in
Parliament
,
and
that
he
would
probably
not
return
.
"
<EOS>
Poor
George
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Alice
had
said
;
"
he
is
a
man
very
much
to
be
pitied
.
"
<EOS>
"
He
is
a
man
very
much
to
be
pitied
,
"
Grey
had
replied
.
<EOS>
After
that
,
nothing
more
was
said
between
them
about
George
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
From
Lady
Glencora
Alice
did
hear
something
;
but
Lady
Glencora
herself
had
not
heard
the
whole
story
.
<EOS>
"
I
believe
he
misbehaved
himself
,
my
dear
,
"
Lady
Glencora
said
;
"
but
then
,
you
know
,
he
always
does
that
.
<EOS>
I
believe
that
he
saw
Mr.
Grey
and
insulted
him
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
you
had
better
not
ask
anything
about
it
till
by
-
and
-
by
.
<EOS>
You
'll
be
able
to
get
anything
out
of
him
then
.
<EOS>
"
In
answer
to
this
Alice
made
her
usual
protest
,
and
Lady
Glencora
,
as
was
customary
,
told
her
that
she
was
a
fool
.
  
<EOS>
I
am
inclined
to
think
that
Mr.
Grey
knew
what
he
was
about
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
once
scolded
him
very
vehemently
for
not
bringing
the
affair
to
an
end
.
<EOS>
"
We
shall
be
going
on
to
Italy
before
it
's
settled
,
"
she
said
;
"
<EOS>
and
I
do
n't
suppose
you
can
go
with
us
,
unless
it
is
settled
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Grey
protested
that
he
had
no
intention
of
going
to
Italy
in
either
case
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
it
will
be
put
off
for
another
year
or
two
,
and
you
are
both
of
you
as
old
as
Adam
and
Eve
already
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
ancient
people
are
never
impatient
,
"
said
Grey
,
laughing
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
were
you
I
would
go
to
her
and
tell
her
,
roundly
,
that
she
should
marry
me
,
and
then
I
would
shake
her
.
<EOS>
If
you
were
to
scold
her
,
till
she
did
not
know
whether
she
stood
on
her
head
or
her
heels
,
she
would
come
to
reason
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Suppose
you
try
that
,
Lady
Glencora
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
.
<EOS>
It
's
she
that
always
scolds
me
,
 
as
you
will
her
,
when
she
's
your
wife
.
<EOS>
You
and
Mr.
Palliser
are
very
much
alike
.
<EOS>
You
're
both
of
you
so
very
virtuous
that
no
woman
would
have
a
chance
of
picking
a
hole
in
your
coats
.
"
  
<EOS>
But
Lady
Glencora
was
wrong
.
<EOS>
Alice
would
,
no
doubt
,
have
submitted
herself
patiently
to
her
lover
's
rebukes
,
and
would
have
confessed
her
own
sins
towards
him
with
any
amount
of
self
-
accusation
that
he
might
have
required
;
but
she
would
not
,
on
that
account
,
have
been
more
willing
to
obey
him
in
that
one
point
,
as
to
which
he
now
required
present
obedience
.
<EOS>
He
understood
that
she
must
be
taught
to
forgive
herself
for
the
evil
she
had
done
,
 
to
forgive
herself
,
at
any
rate
in
part
,
 
before
she
could
be
induced
to
return
to
her
old
allegiance
to
him
.
<EOS>
Thus
they
went
on
together
at
Lucerne
,
passing
quiet
,
idle
days
,
 
with
some
pretence
of
reading
,
with
a
considerable
amount
of
letter
-
writing
,
with
boat
excursions
and
pony
excursions
,
 
till
the
pony
excursions
came
to
a
sudden
end
by
means
of
a
violent
edict
,
as
to
which
,
and
the
cause
of
it
,
a
word
or
two
must
be
said
just
now
.
<EOS>
During
these
days
of
the
boats
and
the
ponies
,
the
carriage
which
Lady
Glencora
hated
so
vehemently
was
shut
up
in
limbo
,
and
things
went
very
pleasantly
with
her
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
received
political
letters
from
England
,
which
made
his
mouth
water
sadly
,
and
was
often
very
fidgety
.
<EOS>
Parliament
was
not
now
sitting
,
and
the
Government
would
,
of
course
,
remain
intact
till
next
February
.
<EOS>
Might
it
not
be
possible
that
when
the
rent
came
in
the
Cabinet
,
he
might
yet
be
present
at
the
darning
?
<EOS>
He
was
a
constant
man
,
and
had
once
declared
his
intention
of
being
absent
for
a
year
.
<EOS>
He
continued
to
speak
to
Grey
of
his
coming
travels
,
as
though
it
was
impossible
that
they
should
be
over
until
after
the
next
Easter
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
sighing
for
Westminster
,
and
regretting
the
blue
books
which
were
accumulating
themselves
at
Matching
;
 
till
on
a
sudden
,
there
came
to
him
tidings
which
upset
all
his
plans
,
which
routed
the
ponies
,
which
made
everything
impossible
,
which
made
the
Alps
impassable
and
the
railways
dangerous
,
which
drove
Burgo
Fitzgerald
out
of
Mr.
Palliser
's
head
,
and
so
confused
him
that
he
could
no
longer
calculate
the
blunders
of
the
present
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
.
<EOS>
All
the
Palliser
world
was
about
to
be
moved
from
its
lowest
depths
,
to
the
summits
of
its
highest
mountains
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
had
whispered
into
her
husband
's
ear
that
she
thought
it
probable
 
;
she
was
n't
sure
;
 
she
did
n't
know
.
<EOS>
And
then
she
burst
out
into
tears
on
his
bosom
as
he
sat
by
her
on
her
bedside
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
beside
himself
when
he
left
her
,
which
he
did
with
the
primary
intention
of
telegraphing
to
London
for
half
a
dozen
leading
physicians
.
<EOS>
He
went
out
by
the
lake
side
,
and
walked
there
alone
for
ten
minutes
in
a
state
of
almost
unconscious
exaltation
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
quite
remember
where
he
was
,
or
what
he
was
doing
.
<EOS>
The
one
thing
in
the
world
which
he
had
lacked
;
the
one
joy
which
he
had
wanted
so
much
,
and
which
is
so
common
among
men
,
was
coming
to
him
also
.
<EOS>
In
a
few
minutes
it
was
to
him
as
though
each
hand
already
rested
on
the
fair
head
of
a
little
male
Palliser
,
of
whom
one
should
rule
in
the
halls
at
Gatherum
,
and
the
other
be
eloquent
among
the
Commons
of
England
.
<EOS>
Hitherto
,
 
for
the
last
eight
or
nine
months
,
since
his
first
hopes
had
begun
to
fade
,
 
he
had
been
a
man
degraded
in
his
own
sight
amidst
all
his
honours
.
<EOS>
What
good
was
all
the
world
to
him
if
he
had
nothing
of
his
own
to
come
after
him
?
<EOS>
We
must
give
him
his
due
,
too
,
when
we
speak
of
this
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
had
wit
enough
to
hide
his
grief
from
his
wife
;
his
knowledge
of
women
and
of
men
in
social
life
had
not
been
sufficient
to
teach
him
how
this
should
be
done
;
but
he
had
wished
to
do
it
.
<EOS>
He
had
never
willingly
rebuked
her
for
his
disappointment
,
either
by
a
glance
of
his
eye
,
or
a
tone
of
his
voice
;
and
now
he
had
already
forgiven
everything
.
<EOS>
Burgo
Fitzgerald
was
a
myth
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Marsham
should
never
again
come
near
her
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bott
was
,
of
course
,
a
thing
abolished
;
 
he
had
not
even
had
the
sense
to
keep
his
seat
in
Parliament
.
<EOS>
Dandy

Flirt

able
saddle
-
ponies
of
Lucerne
had
not
come
across
his
wife
's
path
!
<EOS>
He
went
at
once
into
the
yard
and
ordered
that
the
ponies
should
be
abolished
;
 
sent
away
,
one
and
all
,
to
the
furthest
confines
of
the
canton
;
and
then
he
himself
inspected
the
cushions
of
the
carriage
.
<EOS>
Were
they
dry
?
<EOS>
As
it
was
August
in
those
days
,
and
August
in
Lucerne
is
a
warm
month
,
it
may
be
presumed
that
they
were
dry
.
  
<EOS>
He
then
remembered
that
he
had
promised
to
send
Alice
up
to
his
wife
,
and
he
hurried
back
into
the
house
.
<EOS>
She
was
alone
in
the
breakfast
-
room
,
waiting
for
him
and
for
his
wife
.
<EOS>
In
these
days
,
Mr.
Grey
would
usually
join
them
at
dinner
;
but
he
seldom
saw
them
before
eleven
or
twelve
o'clock
in
the
day
.
<EOS>
Then
he
would
saunter
in
and
join
Mr.
Palliser
,
and
they
would
all
be
together
till
the
evening
.
<EOS>
When
the
expectant
father
of
embryo
dukes
entered
the
room
,
Alice
perceived
at
once
that
some
matter
was
astir
.
<EOS>
His
manner
was
altogether
changed
,
and
he
showed
by
his
eye
that
he
was
eager
and
moved
beyond
his
wo
nt
.
<EOS>
"
Alice
,
"
he
said
,
"
would
you
mind
going
up
to
Glencora
's
room
?
<EOS>
She
wishes
to
speak
to
you
.
"
<EOS>
He
had
never
called
her
Alice
before
,
and
as
soon
as
the
word
was
spoken
,
he
remembered
himself
and
blushed
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
is
n't
ill
,
I
hope
?
"
said
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
 
she
is
n't
ill
.
<EOS>
At
least
I
think
she
had
better
not
get
up
quite
yet
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
let
her
excite
herself
,
if
you
can
help
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
go
to
her
at
once
,
"
said
Alice
rising
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
so
much
obliged
to
you
;
 
but
,
Miss
Vavasor
 
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
called
me
Alice
just
now
,
Mr.
Palliser
,
and
I
took
it
as
a
great
compliment
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
blushed
again
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Did
I
?
<EOS>
Very
well
.
<EOS>
Then
I
'll
do
it
again
 
if
you
'll
let
me
.
<EOS>
But
,
if
you
please
,
do
be
as
calm
with
her
as
you
can
.
<EOS>
She
is
so
easily
excited
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
Of
course
,
if
there
's
anything
she
fancies
,
we
'll
take
care
to
get
it
for
her
;
but
she
must
be
kept
quiet
.
<EOS>
"
Upon
this
Alice
left
him
,
having
had
no
moment
of
time
to
guess
what
had
happened
,
or
was
about
to
happen
;
and
he
was
again
alone
,
contemplating
the
future
glories
of
his
house
.
<EOS>
Had
he
a
thought
for
his
poor
cousin
Jeffrey
,
whose
nose
was
now
so
terribly
out
of
joint
?
<EOS>
No
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
His
thoughts
were
all
of
himself
,
and
the
good
things
that
were
coming
to
him
,
 
of
the
new
world
of
interest
that
was
being
opened
for
him
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
better
to
him
,
this
,
than
being
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
.
<EOS>
He
would
rather
have
it
in
store
for
him
to
be
father
of
the
next
Duke
of
Omnium
,
than
make
half
a
dozen
consecutive
annual
speeches
in
Parliament
as
to
the
ways
and
means
,
and
expenditure
of
the
British
nation
!
<EOS>
Could
it
be
possible
that
this
foreign
tour
had
produced
for
him
this
good
fortune
?
<EOS>
If
so
,
how
luckily
had
things
turned
out
!
<EOS>
He
would
remember
even
that
ball
at
Lady
Monk
's
with
gratitude
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
a
residence
abroad
would
be
best
for
Lady
Glencora
at
this
particular
period
of
her
life
.
<EOS>
If
so
,
abroad
she
should
certainly
live
.
<EOS>
Before
resolving
,
however
,
on
anything
permanently
on
this
head
,
he
thought
that
he
might
judiciously
consult
those
six
first
-
rate
London
physicians
,
whom
,
in
the
first
moment
of
his
excitement
,
he
had
been
desirous
of
summoning
to
Lucerne
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
Alice
had
gone
up
to
the
bedroom
of
the
lady
who
was
now
to
be
the
subject
of
so
much
anxious
thought
.
<EOS>
When
she
entered
the
room
,
her
friend
was
up
and
in
her
dressing
-
gown
,
lying
on
a
sofa
which
stood
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
Alice
,
I
'm
so
glad
you
've
come
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
so
want
to
hear
your
voice
.
"
<EOS>
Then
Alice
knelt
beside
her
,
and
asked
her
if
she
were
ill
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
has
n't
told
you
?
<EOS>
But
of
course
he
would
n't
.
<EOS>
How
could
he
?
<EOS>
But
,
Alice
,
how
did
he
look
?
<EOS>
Did
you
observe
anything
about
him
?
<EOS>
Was
he
pleased
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
observe
something
,
and
I
think
he
was
pleased
.
<EOS>
But
what
is
it
?
<EOS>
He
called
me
Alice
.
<EOS>
And
seemed
to
be
quite
unlike
himself
.
<EOS>
But
what
is
it
?
<EOS>
He
told
me
that
I
was
to
come
to
you
instantly
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Alice
,
ca
n't
you
guess
?
<EOS>
"
Then
suddenly
Alice
did
guess
the
secret
,
and
whispered
her
guess
into
Lady
Glencora
's
ear
.
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
it
is
so
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
what
they
'll
do
.
<EOS>
They
'll
kill
me
by
fussing
over
me
.
<EOS>
If
I
could
go
about
my
work
like
a
washerwoman
,
I
should
be
all
right
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
so
happy
,
"
she
said
,
some
two
or
three
hours
afterwards
.
<EOS>
"
I
wo
n't
deny
that
I
am
very
happy
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
as
though
I
were
destined
to
bring
nothing
but
misery
to
everybody
,
and
I
used
to
wish
myself
dead
so
often
.
<EOS>
I
sha
n't
wish
myself
dead
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
shall
all
have
to
go
home
,
I
suppose
?
"
said
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
says
so
;
 
but
he
seems
to
think
that
I
ought
n't
to
travel
above
a
mile
and
a
half
a
day
.
<EOS>
When
I
talked
of
going
down
the
Rhine
in
one
of
the
steamers
,
I
thought
he
would
have
gone
into
a
fit
.
<EOS>
When
I
asked
him
why
,
he
gave
me
such
a
look
.
<EOS>
I
know
he
'll
make
a
goose
of
himself
;
 
and
he
'll
make
geese
of
us
,
too
;
which
is
worse
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
On
that
afternoon
,
as
they
were
walking
together
,
Mr.
Palliser
told
the
important
secret
to
his
new
friend
,
Mr.
Grey
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
deny
himself
the
pleasure
of
talking
about
this
great
event
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
matter
,
you
see
,
of
such
immense
importance
to
me
,
"
Mr.
Palliser
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
,
it
is
,
"
said
Grey
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Every
man
feels
that
when
a
child
is
about
to
be
born
to
him
.
"
<EOS>
But
this
did
not
at
all
satisfy
Mr.
Palliser
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
he
.
<EOS>
"
That
's
of
course
.
<EOS>
It
is
an
important
thing
to
everybody
;
 
very
important
,
no
doubt
.
<EOS>
But
,
when
a
man
 
.
<EOS>
You
see
,
Grey
,
I
do
n't
think
a
man
is
a
bit
better
because
he
is
rich
,
or
because
he
has
a
title
;
nor
do
I
think
he
is
likely
to
be
in
any
degree
the
happier
.
<EOS>
I
am
quite
sure
that
he
has
no
right
to
be
in
the
slightest
degree
proud
of
that
which
he
has
had
no
hand
in
doing
for
himself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Men
usually
are
very
proud
of
such
advantages
,
"
said
Grey
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
that
I
am
;
I
do
n't
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
I
am
proud
of
some
things
.
<EOS>
Whenever
I
can
manage
to
carry
a
point
in
the
House
,
I
feel
very
proud
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
think
I
ever
knocked
under
to
any
one
,
and
I
am
proud
of
that
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Perhaps
,
Mr.
Palliser
was
thinking
of
a
certain
time
when
his
uncle
the
Duke
had
threatened
him
,
and
he
had
not
given
way
to
the
Duke
's
threats
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
do
n't
think
I
'm
proud
because
chance
has
made
me
my
uncle
's
heir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
in
the
least
,
I
should
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
do
feel
that
a
son
to
me
is
of
more
importance
than
it
is
to
most
men
.
<EOS>
A
strong
anxiety
on
the
subject
,
is
,
I
think
,
more
excusable
in
me
than
it
might
be
in
another
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
whether
I
quite
make
myself
understood
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
yes
!
<EOS>
When
there
's
a
dukedom
and
heaven
knows
how
many
thousands
a
year
to
be
disposed
of
,
the
question
of
their
future
ownership
does
become
important
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
This
property
is
so
much
more
interesting
to
one
,
if
one
feels
that
all
one
does
to
it
is
done
for
one
's
own
son
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
yet
,
"
said
Grey
,
"
of
all
the
great
plunderers
of
property
throughout
Europe
,
the
Popes
have
been
the
most
greedy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
it
's
different
,
when
a
man
ca
n't
have
a
wife
,
"
said
Mr.
Palliser
.
  
<EOS>
From
all
this
it
may
be
seen
that
Mr.
Palliser
and
Mr.
Grey
had
become
very
intimate
.
<EOS>
Had
chance
brought
them
together
in
London
<EOS>
they
might
have
met
a
score
of
times
before
Mr.
Palliser
would
have
thought
of
doing
more
than
bowing
to
such
an
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Grey
might
have
spent
weeks
at
Matching
,
without
having
achieved
anything
like
intimacy
with
its
noble
owner
.
<EOS>
But
things
of
that
kind
progress
more
quickly
abroad
than
they
do
at
home
.
<EOS>
The
deck
of
an
ocean
steamer
is
perhaps
the
most
prolific
hotbed
of
the
growth
of
sudden
friendships
;
but
an
hotel
by
the
side
of
a
Swiss
lake
does
almost
as
well
.
  
<EOS>
For
some
time
after
this
Lady
Glencora
's
conduct
was
frequently
so
indiscreet
as
to
drive
her
husband
almost
to
frenzy
.
<EOS>
On
the
very
day
after
the
news
had
been
communicated
to
him
,
she
proposed
a
picnic
,
and
made
the
proposition
not
only
in
the
presence
of
Alice
,
but
in
that
of
Mr.
Grey
also
!
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
,
on
such
an
occasion
,
could
not
express
all
that
he
thought
;
but
he
looked
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
the
matter
,
now
,
Plantagenet
?
"
said
his
wife
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nothing
,
"
said
he
;
 
"
nothing
.
<EOS>
Never
mind
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
shall
we
make
this
party
up
to
the
chapel
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
chapel
in
question
was
Tell
's
chapel
 
ever
so
far
up
the
lake
.
<EOS>
A
journey
in
a
steam
-
boat
would
have
been
necessary
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
!
"
said
he
,
shouting
out
his
refusal
at
her
.
<EOS>
"
We
will
not
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
need
n't
be
angry
about
it
,
"
said
she
;
 
as
though
he
could
have
failed
to
be
stirred
by
such
a
proposition
at
such
a
time
.
<EOS>
On
another
occasion
she
returned
from
an
evening
walk
,
showing
on
her
face
some
sign
of
the
exercise
she
had
taken
.
  
<EOS>
"
Good
G
 
---
!
<EOS>
Glencora
,
"
said
he
,
"
do
you
mean
to
kill
yourself
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
wanted
her
to
eat
six
or
seven
times
a
day
;
and
always
told
her
that
she
was
eating
too
much
,
remembering
some
ancient
proverb
about
little
and
often
.
<EOS>
He
watched
her
now
as
closely
as
Mrs.
Marsham
and
Mr.
Bott
had
watched
her
before
;
and
she
always
knew
that
he
was
doing
so
.
<EOS>
She
made
the
matter
worse
by
continually
proposing
to
do
things
which
she
knew
he
would
not
permit
,
in
order
that
she
might
enjoy
the
fun
of
seeing
his
agony
and
amazement
.
<EOS>
But
this
,
though
it
was
fun
to
her
at
the
moment
,
produced
anything
but
fun
,
as
its
general
result
.
  
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
word
,
Alice
,
I
think
this
will
kill
me
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
to
stir
out
of
the
house
now
,
unless
I
go
in
the
carriage
,
or
he
is
with
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
wo
n't
last
long
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
what
you
call
long
.
<EOS>
As
for
walking
with
him
,
it
's
out
of
the
question
.
<EOS>
He
goes
about
a
mile
an
hour
.
<EOS>
And
then
he
makes
me
look
so
much
like
a
fool
.
<EOS>
I
had
no
idea
that
he
would
be
such
an
old
coddle
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
coddling
will
all
be
given
to
some
one
else
,
very
soon
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
baby
could
possibly
live
through
it
,
if
you
mean
that
.
<EOS>
If
there
is
a
baby
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
suppose
there
will
be
one
,
by
-
and
-
by
,
"
said
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
be
a
fool
!
<EOS>
But
,
if
there
is
,
I
shall
take
that
matter
into
my
own
hands
.
<EOS>
He
can
do
what
he
pleases
with
me
,
and
I
ca
n't
help
myself
;
but
I
sha
n't
let
him
or
anybody
do
what
they
please
with
my
baby
.
<EOS>
I
know
what
I
'm
about
in
such
matters
a
great
deal
better
than
he
does
.
<EOS>
I
've
no
doubt
he
's
a
very
clever
man
in
Parliament
;
but
he
does
n't
seem
to
me
to
understand
anything
else
.
"
  
<EOS>
Alice
was
making
some
very
wise
speech
in
answer
to
this
,
when
Lady
Glencora
interrupted
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Grey
would
n't
make
himself
so
troublesome
,
I
'm
quite
sure
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Then
Alice
held
her
tongue
.
  
<EOS>
When
the
first
consternation
arising
from
the
news
had
somewhat
subsided
,
 
say
in
a
fortnight
from
the
day
in
which
Mr.
Palliser
was
made
so
triumphant
,
 
and
when
tidings
had
been
duly
sent
to
the
Duke
,
and
an
answer
from
his
Grace
had
come
,
arrangements
were
made
for
the
return
of
the
party
to
England
.
<EOS>
The
Duke
's
reply
was
very
short
:
    
MY
DEAR
PLANTAGENET
,
 
<EOS>
Give
my
kind
love
to
Glencora
.
<EOS>
If
it
's
a
boy
,
of
course
I
will
be
one
of
the
godfathers
.
<EOS>
The
Prince
,
who
is
very
kind
,
will
perhaps
oblige
me
by
being
the
other
.
<EOS>
I
should
advise
you
to
return
as
soon
as
convenient
.
  
<EOS>
Your
affectionate
uncle
,
  
OMNIUM
.
  
<EOS>
That
was
the
letter
;
and
short
as
it
was
,
it
was
probably
the
longest
that
Mr.
Palliser
had
ever
received
from
the
Duke
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
great
trouble
about
the
mode
of
their
return
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
what
nonsense
,
"
said
Glencora
.
<EOS>
"
Let
us
get
into
an
express
train
,
and
go
right
through
to
London
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
looked
at
her
with
a
countenance
full
of
rebuke
and
sorrow
.
<EOS>
He
was
always
so
looking
at
her
now
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
mean
,
Plantagenet
,
that
we
are
to
be
dragged
all
across
the
Continent
in
that
horrible
carriage
,
and
be
a
thousand
days
on
the
road
,
I
for
one
wo
n't
submit
to
it
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
had
never
told
him
a
word
about
it
,
"
she
said
afterwards
to
Alice
.
"
<EOS>
He
would
never
have
found
it
out
himself
,
till
this
thing
was
all
over
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
did
at
last
consent
to
take
the
joint
opinion
of
a
Swiss
doctor
and
an
English
one
who
was
settled
at
Berne
;
and
who
,
on
the
occasion
,
was
summoned
to
Lucerne
.
<EOS>
They
suggested
the
railway
;
and
as
letters
arrived
for
Mr.
Palliser
,
 
medical
letters
,
 
in
which
the
same
opinion
was
broached
,
it
was
agreed
,
at
last
,
that
they
should
return
by
railway
;
but
they
were
to
make
various
halts
on
the
road
,
stopping
at
each
halting
-
place
for
a
day
.
<EOS>
The
first
was
,
of
course
,
Basle
,
and
from
Basle
they
were
to
go
on
to
Baden
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
particularly
want
to
see
Baden
again
,
"
Lady
Glencora
said
;
"
and
perhaps
I
may
be
able
to
get
back
my
napoleon
.
"
   
<EOS>
Showing
What
Happened
in
the
Churchyard
.
 
<EOS>
These
arrangements
as
to
the
return
of
Mr.
Palliser
's
party
to
London
did
not
,
of
course
,
include
Mr.
Grey
.
<EOS>
They
were
generally
discussed
in
Mr.
Grey
's
absence
,
and
communicated
to
him
by
Mr.
Palliser
.
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
we
shall
see
you
in
England
before
long
?
"
said
Mr.
Palliser
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
able
to
tell
you
that
before
you
go
,
"
said
Grey
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Not
but
that
in
any
event
I
shall
return
to
England
before
the
winter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
come
to
us
at
Matching
,
"
said
Mr.
Palliser
.
<EOS>
"
We
shall
be
most
happy
to
have
you
.
<EOS>
Say
that
you
'll
come
for
the
first
fortnight
in
December
.
<EOS>
After
that
we
always
go
to
the
Duke
,
in
Barsetshire
.
<EOS>
Though
,
by
-
the
-
by
,
I
do
n't
suppose
we
shall
go
anywhere
this
year
,
"
Mr.
Palliser
added
,
interrupting
the
warmth
of
his
invitation
,
and
reflecting
that
,
under
the
present
circumstances
,
perhaps
,
it
might
be
improper
to
have
any
guests
at
Matching
in
December
.
<EOS>
But
he
had
become
very
fond
of
Mr.
Grey
,
and
on
this
occasion
,
as
he
had
done
on
some
others
,
pressed
him
warmly
to
make
an
attempt
at
Parliament
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
n't
nearly
so
difficult
as
you
think
,
"
said
he
,
when
Grey
declared
that
he
would
not
know
where
to
look
for
a
seat
.
<EOS>
"
See
the
men
that
get
in
.
<EOS>
There
was
Mr.
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
Even
he
got
a
seat
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
he
had
to
pay
for
it
very
dearly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
might
easily
find
some
quiet
little
borough
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Quiet
little
boroughs
have
usually
got
their
own
quiet
little
Members
,
"
said
Grey
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
're
fond
of
change
;
and
if
you
like
to
spend
a
thousand
pounds
,
the
thing
is
n't
difficult
.
<EOS>
I
'll
put
you
in
the
way
of
it
.
"
<EOS>
But
Mr.
Grey
still
declined
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
a
man
prone
to
be
talked
out
of
his
own
way
of
life
,
and
the
very
fact
that
George
Vavasor
had
been
in
Parliament
would
of
itself
have
gone
far
towards
preventing
any
attempt
on
his
part
in
that
direction
.
<EOS>
Alice
had
also
wanted
him
to
go
into
public
life
,
but
he
had
put
aside
her
request
as
though
the
thing
were
quite
out
of
the
question
,
 
never
giving
a
moment
to
its
consideration
.
<EOS>
Had
she
asked
him
to
settle
himself
and
her
in
Central
Africa
,
his
manner
and
mode
of
refusal
would
have
been
the
same
.
<EOS>
It
was
this
immobility
on
his
part
,
 
this
absolute
want
of
any
of
the
weakness
of
indecision
,
which
had
frightened
her
,
and
driven
her
away
from
him
.
<EOS>
He
was
partly
aware
of
this
;
but
that
which
he
had
declined
to
do
at
her
solicitation
,
he
certainly
would
not
do
at
the
advice
of
any
one
else
.
<EOS>
So
it
was
that
he
argued
the
matter
with
himself
.
<EOS>
Had
he
now
allowed
himself
to
be
so
counselled
,
with
what
terrible
acknowledgements
of
his
own
faults
must
he
not
have
presented
himself
before
Alice
?
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
books
,
then
,
will
be
your
object
in
life
?
"
said
Mr.
Palliser
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
they
will
be
my
aids
,
"
Grey
answered
.
<EOS>
"
I
almost
doubt
whether
any
object
such
as
that
you
mean
is
necessary
for
life
,
or
even
expedient
.
<EOS>
It
seems
to
me
that
if
a
man
can
so
train
himself
that
he
may
live
honestly
and
die
fearlessly
,
he
has
done
about
as
much
as
is
necessary
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
has
done
a
great
deal
,
certainly
,
"
said
Mr.
Palliser
,
who
was
not
ready
enough
to
carry
on
the
argument
as
he
might
have
done
<EOS>
had
more
time
been
given
to
him
to
consider
it
.
<EOS>
He
knew
very
well
that
he
himself
was
working
for
others
,
and
not
for
himself
;
and
he
was
aware
,
though
he
had
not
analysed
his
own
convictions
on
the
matter
,
that
good
men
struggle
as
they
do
in
order
that
others
,
besides
themselves
,
may
live
honestly
,
and
,
if
possible
,
die
fearlessly
.
<EOS>
The
recluse
of
Nethercoats
had
thought
much
more
about
all
this
than
the
rising
star
of
the
House
of
Commons
;
but
the
philosophy
of
the
rising
star
was
the
better
philosophy
of
the
two
,
though
he
was
by
far
the
less
brilliant
man
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
see
why
a
man
should
not
live
honestly
and
be
a
Member
of
Parliament
as
well
,
"
continued
Mr.
Palliser
,
when
he
had
been
silent
for
a
few
minutes
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nor
I
either
,
"
said
Grey
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
that
there
are
such
men
,
and
that
the
country
is
under
great
obligation
to
them
.
<EOS>
But
they
are
subject
to
temptations
which
a
prudent
man
like
myself
may
perhaps
do
well
to
avoid
.
"
<EOS>
But
though
he
spoke
with
an
assured
tone
,
he
was
shaken
,
and
almost
regretted
that
he
did
not
accept
the
aid
which
was
offered
to
him
.
<EOS>
It
is
astonishing
how
strong
a
man
may
be
to
those
around
him
,
 
<EOS>
how
impregnable
may
be
his
exterior
,
while
within
he
feels
himself
to
be
as
weak
as
water
,
and
as
unstable
as
chaff
.
  
<EOS>
But
the
object
which
he
had
now
in
view
was
a
renewal
of
his
engagement
with
Alice
,
and
he
felt
that
he
must
obtain
an
answer
from
her
before
they
left
Lucerne
.
<EOS>
If
she
still
persisted
in
refusing
to
give
him
her
hand
,
it
would
not
be
consistent
with
his
dignity
as
a
man
to
continue
his
immediate
pursuit
of
her
any
longer
.
<EOS>
In
such
case
he
must
leave
her
,
and
see
what
future
time
might
bring
forth
.
<EOS>
He
believed
himself
to
be
aware
that
he
would
never
offer
his
love
to
another
woman
;
and
if
Alice
were
to
remain
single
,
he
might
try
again
,
after
the
lapse
of
a
year
or
two
.
<EOS>
But
if
he
failed
now
,
 
then
,
for
that
year
or
two
,
he
would
see
her
no
more
.
<EOS>
Having
so
resolved
,
and
being
averse
to
anything
like
a
surprise
,
he
asked
her
,
as
he
left
her
one
evening
,
whether
she
would
walk
with
him
on
the
following
morning
.
<EOS>
That
morning
would
be
the
morning
of
her
last
day
at
Lucerne
;
and
as
she
assented
she
knew
well
what
was
to
come
.
<EOS>
She
said
nothing
to
Lady
Glencora
on
the
subject
,
but
allowed
the
coming
prospects
of
the
Palliser
family
to
form
the
sole
subject
of
their
conversation
that
night
,
as
it
had
done
on
every
night
since
the
great
news
had
become
known
.
<EOS>
They
were
always
together
for
an
hour
every
evening
before
Alice
was
allowed
to
go
to
bed
,
and
during
this
hour
the
anxieties
of
the
future
father
and
mother
were
always
discussed
till
Alice
Vavasor
was
almost
tired
of
them
.
<EOS>
But
she
was
patient
with
her
friend
,
and
on
this
special
night
she
was
patient
as
ever
.
<EOS>
But
when
she
was
released
and
was
alone
,
she
made
a
great
endeavour
to
come
to
some
fixed
resolution
as
to
what
she
would
do
on
the
morrow
,
 
some
resolution
which
should
be
absolutely
resolute
,
and
from
which
no
eloquence
on
the
part
of
any
one
should
move
her
.
<EOS>
But
such
resolutions
are
not
easily
reached
,
and
Alice
laboured
through
half
the
night
almost
in
vain
.
<EOS>
She
knew
that
she
loved
the
man
.
<EOS>
She
knew
that
he
was
as
true
to
her
as
the
sun
is
true
to
the
earth
.
<EOS>
She
knew
that
she
would
be
,
in
all
respects
,
safe
in
his
hands
.
<EOS>
She
knew
that
Lady
Glencora
would
be
delighted
,
and
her
father
gratified
.
<EOS>
She
knew
that
the
countesses
would
open
their
arms
to
her
,
 
though
I
doubt
whether
this
knowledge
was
in
itself
very
persuasive
.
<EOS>
She
knew
that
by
such
a
marriage
she
would
gain
all
that
women
generally
look
to
gain
when
they
give
themselves
away
.
<EOS>
But
,
nevertheless
,
as
far
as
she
could
decide
at
all
,
she
decided
against
her
lover
.
<EOS>
She
had
no
right
of
her
own
to
be
taken
back
after
the
evil
that
she
had
done
,
and
she
did
not
choose
to
be
taken
back
as
an
object
of
pity
and
forgiveness
.
  
<EOS>
"
Where
are
you
going
?
"
said
her
cousin
,
when
she
came
in
with
her
hat
on
,
soon
after
breakfast
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
going
to
walk
,
 
with
Mr.
Grey
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
By
appointment
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
by
appointment
.
<EOS>
He
asked
me
yesterday
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
it
's
all
settled
,
and
you
have
n't
told
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
All
that
is
settled
I
have
told
you
very
often
.
<EOS>
He
asked
me
yesterday
to
walk
with
him
this
morning
,
and
I
could
not
well
refuse
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
should
you
have
wished
to
refuse
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
n't
said
that
I
did
wish
it
.
<EOS>
But
I
hate
scenes
,
and
I
think
it
would
have
been
pleasanter
for
us
to
have
parted
without
any
occasion
for
special
words
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Alice
,
you
are
such
a
fool
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
So
you
tell
me
very
often
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
he
is
now
going
to
say
the
very
thing
that
he
has
come
all
this
way
for
the
purpose
of
saying
.
<EOS>
He
has
been
wonderfully
slow
about
it
;
but
then
slow
as
he
is
,
you
are
slower
.
<EOS>
If
you
do
n't
make
it
up
with
him
now
,
I
really
shall
think
you
are
very
wicked
.
<EOS>
I
am
becoming
like
Lady
Midlothian
;
 
I
ca
n't
understand
it
.
<EOS>
I
know
you
want
to
be
his
wife
,
and
<EOS>
I
know
he
wants
to
be
your
husband
,
and
the
only
thing
that
keeps
you
apart
is
your
obstinacy
,
 
just
because
you
have
said
you
would
n't
have
him
.
<EOS>
My
belief
is
that
if
Lady
Midlothian
and
the
rest
of
us
were
to
pat
you
on
the
back
,
and
tell
you
how
right
you
were
,
you
'd
ask
him
to
take
you
,
out
of
defiance
.
<EOS>
You
may
be
sure
of
this
,
Alice
;
if
you
refuse
him
now
,
it
'll
be
for
the
last
time
.
"
  
<EOS>
This
,
and
much
more
of
the
same
kind
<EOS>
,
she
bore
before
Mr.
Grey
came
to
take
her
,
and
she
answered
to
it
all
as
little
as
she
could
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
making
me
very
unhappy
,
Glencora
,
"
she
said
once
.
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
could
break
you
down
with
unhappiness
,
"
Lady
Glencora
answered
,
"
so
that
he
might
find
you
less
stiff
,
and
hard
,
and
unmanageable
.
"
<EOS>
Directly
upon
that
he
came
in
,
looking
as
though
he
had
no
business
on
hand
more
exciting
than
his
ordinary
morning
's
tranquil
employments
.
<EOS>
Alice
at
once
got
up
to
start
with
him
.
"
<EOS>
So
you
and
Alice
are
going
to
make
your
adieux
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
"
It
must
be
done
sooner
or
later
,
"
said
Mr.
Grey
;
and
then
they
went
off
.
  
<EOS>
Those
who
know
Lucerne
,
 
and
almost
everybody
now
does
know
Lucerne
,
 
will
remember
the
big
hotel
which
has
been
built
close
to
the
landing
-
pier
of
the
steamers
,
and
will
remember
also
the
church
that
stands
upon
a
little
hill
or
rising
ground
,
to
the
left
of
you
,
as
you
come
out
of
the
inn
upon
the
lake
.
<EOS>
The
church
is
immediately
over
the
lake
,
and
round
the
church
there
is
a
burying
-
ground
,
and
skirting
the
burying
-
ground
there
are
cloisters
,
through
the
arches
and
apertures
of
which
they
who
walk
and
sit
there
look
down
immediately
upon
the
blue
water
,
and
across
the
water
upon
the
frowning
menaces
of
Mount
Pilate
.
<EOS>
It
is
one
of
the
prettiest
spots
in
that
land
of
beauty
;
and
its
charm
is
to
my
feeling
enhanced
by
the
sepulchral
monuments
over
which
I
walk
,
and
by
which
I
am
surrounded
,
as
I
stand
there
.
<EOS>
Up
here
,
into
these
cloisters
,
Alice
and
John
Grey
went
together
.
<EOS>
I
doubt
whether
he
had
formed
any
purpose
of
doing
so
.
<EOS>
She
certainly
would
have
gone
without
question
in
any
direction
that
he
might
have
led
her
.
<EOS>
The
distance
from
the
inn
up
to
the
church
-
gate
did
not
take
them
ten
minutes
,
and
when
they
were
there
their
walk
was
over
.
<EOS>
But
the
place
was
solitary
,
and
they
were
alone
;
and
it
might
be
as
well
for
Mr.
Grey
to
speak
what
words
he
had
to
say
there
as
elsewhere
.
<EOS>
They
had
often
been
together
in
those
cloisters
before
,
but
on
such
occasions
either
Mr.
Palliser
or
Lady
Glencora
had
been
with
them
.
<EOS>
On
their
slow
passage
up
the
hill
very
little
was
spoken
,
and
that
little
was
of
no
moment
.
<EOS>
"
We
will
go
in
here
for
a
few
minutes
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
the
prettiest
spot
about
Lucerne
,
and
we
do
n't
know
when
we
may
see
it
again
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
So
they
went
in
,
and
sat
down
on
one
of
the
embrasures
that
open
from
the
cloisters
over
the
lake
.
  
<EOS>
"
Probably
never
again
,
"
said
Alice
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
yet
I
have
been
here
now
two
years
running
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
shuddered
as
she
remembered
that
in
that
former
year
George
Vavasor
had
been
with
her
.
<EOS>
As
she
thought
of
it
all
she
hated
herself
.
<EOS>
Over
and
over
again
she
had
told
herself
that
she
had
so
mismanaged
the
latter
years
of
her
life
that
it
was
impossible
for
her
not
to
hate
herself
.
<EOS>
No
woman
had
a
clearer
idea
of
feminine
constancy
than
she
had
,
and
no
woman
had
sinned
against
that
idea
more
deeply
.
<EOS>
He
gave
her
time
to
think
of
all
this
as
he
sat
there
looking
down
upon
the
water
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
yet
I
would
sooner
live
in
Cambridgeshire
,
"
were
the
first
words
he
spoke
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
so
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Partly
because
all
beauty
is
best
enjoyed
when
it
is
sought
for
with
some
trouble
and
difficulty
,
and
partly
because
such
beauty
,
and
the
romance
which
is
attached
to
it
,
should
not
make
up
the
staple
of
one
's
life
.
<EOS>
Romance
,
if
it
is
to
come
at
all
,
should
always
come
by
fits
and
starts
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
to
live
in
a
pretty
country
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
would
like
to
live
a
romantic
life
,
 
no
doubt
;
but
all
those
things
lose
their
charm
if
they
are
made
common
.
<EOS>
When
a
man
has
to
go
to
Vienna
or
St.
Petersburg
two
or
three
times
a
month
,
you
do
n't
suppose
he
enjoys
travelling
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
All
the
same
,
I
should
like
to
live
in
a
pretty
country
,
"
said
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
want
you
to
come
and
live
in
a
very
ugly
country
.
<EOS>
"
Then
he
paused
for
a
minute
or
two
,
not
looking
at
her
,
but
gazing
still
on
the
mountain
opposite
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
speak
a
word
,
but
looked
as
he
was
looking
.
<EOS>
She
knew
that
the
request
was
coming
,
and
had
been
thinking
about
it
all
night
;
but
now
that
it
had
come
she
did
not
know
how
to
bear
herself
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
,
"
he
went
on
to
say
,
"
that
you
would
let
that
consideration
stand
in
your
way
,
if
on
other
grounds
you
were
willing
to
become
my
wife
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
consideration
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Because
Nethercoats
is
not
so
pretty
as
Lucerne
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
It
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
,
"
said
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
should
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nothing
;
nothing
at
all
,
"
repeated
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
come
,
then
?
<EOS>
Will
you
come
and
be
my
wife
,
and
help
me
to
be
happy
amidst
all
that
ugliness
?
<EOS>
Will
you
come
and
be
my
one
beautiful
thing
,
my
treasure
,
my
joy
,
my
comfort
,
my
counsellor
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
want
no
counsellor
,
Mr.
Grey
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
man
ever
wanted
one
more
.
<EOS>
Alice
,
this
has
been
a
bad
year
to
me
,
and
I
do
not
think
that
it
has
been
a
happy
one
for
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
,
no
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Let
us
forget
it
,
 
or
rather
,
let
us
treat
it
as
though
it
were
forgotten
.
<EOS>
Twelve
months
ago
you
were
mine
.
<EOS>
You
were
,
at
any
rate
,
so
much
mine
that
I
had
a
right
to
boast
of
my
possession
among
my
friends
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
a
poor
boast
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
did
not
seem
to
think
so
.
<EOS>
I
had
<EOS>
but
one
or
two
to
whom
I
could
speak
of
you
,
but
they
told
me
that
I
was
going
to
be
a
happy
man
.
<EOS>
As
to
myself
,
I
was
sure
that
I
was
to
be
so
.
<EOS>
No
man
was
ever
better
contented
with
his
bargain
than
I
was
with
mine
.
<EOS>
Let
us
go
back
to
it
,
and
the
last
twelve
months
shall
be
as
though
they
had
never
been
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
can
not
be
,
Mr.
Grey
.
<EOS>
If
it
could
,
I
should
be
worse
even
than
I
am
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
can
not
it
be
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Because
I
can
not
forgive
myself
what
I
have
done
,
and
because
you
ought
not
to
forgive
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
do
.
<EOS>
There
has
never
been
an
hour
with
me
in
which
there
has
been
an
offence
of
yours
rankling
in
my
bosom
unforgiven
.
<EOS>
I
think
you
have
been
foolish
,
misguided
,
 
<EOS>
led
away
by
a
vain
ambition
,
and
that
in
the
difficulty
to
which
these
things
brought
you
,
you
endeavoured
to
constrain
yourself
to
do
an
act
,
which
,
when
it
came
near
to
you
,
 
when
the
doing
of
it
had
to
be
more
closely
considered
,
you
found
to
be
contrary
to
your
nature
.
"
<EOS>
Now
,
as
he
spoke
thus
,
she
turned
her
eyes
upon
him
,
and
looked
at
him
,
wondering
that
he
should
have
had
power
to
read
her
heart
so
accurately
.
<EOS>
"
I
never
believed
that
you
would
marry
your
cousin
.
<EOS>
When
I
was
told
of
it
,
I
knew
that
trouble
had
blinded
you
for
awhile
.
<EOS>
You
had
driven
yourself
to
revolt
against
me
,
and
upon
that
your
heart
misgave
you
,
and
<EOS>
you
said
to
yourself
that
it
did
not
matter
then
how
you
might
throw
away
all
your
sweetness
.
<EOS>
You
see
that
I
speak
of
your
old
love
for
me
with
the
frank
conceit
of
a
happy
lover
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
 
no
,
no
!
"
<EOS>
she
ejaculated
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
the
storm
passes
over
the
tree
and
does
not
tear
it
up
by
the
roots
or
spoil
it
of
all
its
symmetry
.
<EOS>
When
we
hear
the
winds
blowing
,
and
see
how
the
poor
thing
is
shaken
,
we
think
that
its
days
are
numbered
and
its
destruction
at
hand
.
<EOS>
Alice
,
when
the
winds
were
shaking
you
,
and
you
were
torn
and
buffeted
,
I
never
thought
so
.
<EOS>
There
may
be
some
who
will
forgive
you
slowly
.
<EOS>
Your
own
self
-
forgiveness
will
be
slow
.
<EOS>
But
I
,
who
have
known
you
better
than
any
one
,
 
yes
,
better
than
any
one
,
 
I
have
forgiven
you
everything
,
have
forgiven
you
instantly
.
<EOS>
Come
to
me
,
Alice
,
and
comfort
me
.
<EOS>
Come
to
me
,
for
I
want
you
sorely
.
"
<EOS>
She
sat
quite
still
,
looking
at
the
lake
and
the
mountain
beyond
,
but
she
said
nothing
.
<EOS>
What
could
she
say
to
him
?
<EOS>
"
My
need
of
you
is
much
greater
now
,
"
he
went
on
to
say
,
"
than
when
I
first
asked
you
to
share
the
world
with
me
.
<EOS>
Then
I
could
have
borne
to
lose
you
,
as
I
had
never
boasted
to
myself
that
you
were
my
own
,
 
had
never
pictured
to
myself
the
life
that
might
be
mine
if
you
were
always
to
be
with
me
.
<EOS>
But
since
that
day
I
have
had
no
other
hope
,
 
no
other
hope
but
this
for
which
I
plead
now
.
<EOS>
Am
I
to
plead
in
vain
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
know
me
,
"
she
said
;
"
how
vile
I
have
been
!
<EOS>
You
do
not
think
what
it
is
,
 
for
a
woman
to
have
promised
herself
to
one
man
while
she
loved
another
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
it
was
me
you
loved
.
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
Alice
,
I
can
forgive
that
.
<EOS>
Do
I
not
tell
you
that
I
did
forgive
it
the
moment
that
I
heard
it
?
<EOS>
Do
you
not
hear
me
say
that
I
never
for
a
moment
thought
that
you
would
marry
him
?
<EOS>
Alice
,
you
should
scold
me
for
my
vanity
,
for
I
have
believed
all
through
that
you
loved
me
,
and
me
only
.
<EOS>
Come
to
me
,
dear
,
and
tell
me
that
it
is
so
,
and
the
past
shall
be
only
as
a
dream
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
dreaming
it
always
,
"
said
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
will
cease
to
be
bitter
dreams
if
your
head
be
upon
my
shoulder
.
<EOS>
You
will
cease
to
reproach
yourself
when
you
know
that
you
have
made
me
happy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
never
cease
to
reproach
myself
.
<EOS>
I
have
done
that
which
no
woman
can
do
and
honour
herself
afterwards
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
 
a
jilt
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
noblest
jilt
that
ever
yet
halted
between
two
minds
!
<EOS>
There
has
been
no
touch
of
selfishness
in
your
fickleness
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
could
be
hard
enough
upon
a
woman
who
had
left
me
for
greater
wealth
,
for
a
higher
rank
,
 
who
had
left
me
even
that
she
might
be
gay
and
merry
.
<EOS>
It
has
not
been
so
with
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
it
has
.
<EOS>
I
thought
you
were
too
firm
in
your
own
will
,
and
 
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
you
think
so
still
.
<EOS>
Is
that
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
does
not
matter
what
I
think
now
.
<EOS>
I
am
a
fallen
creature
,
and
have
no
longer
a
right
to
such
thoughts
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
better
for
us
both
that
you
should
leave
me
,
 
and
forget
me
.
<EOS>
There
are
things
which
,
if
a
woman
does
them
,
should
never
be
forgotten
;
 
which
she
should
never
permit
herself
to
forget
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
am
I
to
be
punished
,
then
,
because
of
your
fault
?
<EOS>
Is
that
your
sense
of
justice
?
"
<EOS>
He
got
up
,
and
standing
before
her
,
looked
down
upon
her
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Alice
,
if
you
will
tell
me
that
you
do
not
love
me
,
I
will
believe
you
,
and
will
trouble
you
no
more
.
<EOS>
I
know
that
you
will
say
nothing
to
me
that
is
false
.
<EOS>
Through
it
all
you
have
spoken
no
word
of
falsehood
.
<EOS>
If
you
love
me
,
after
what
has
passed
,
I
have
a
right
to
demand
your
hand
.
<EOS>
My
happiness
requires
it
,
and
I
have
a
right
to
expect
your
compliance
.
<EOS>
I
do
demand
it
.
<EOS>
If
you
love
me
,
Alice
,
I
tell
you
that
you
dare
not
refuse
me
.
<EOS>
If
you
do
so
,
you
will
fail
hereafter
to
reconcile
it
to
your
conscience
before
God
.
"
  
<EOS>
Then
he
stopped
his
speech
,
and
waited
for
a
reply
;
but
Alice
sat
silent
beneath
his
gaze
,
with
her
eyes
turned
upon
the
tombstones
beneath
her
feet
.
<EOS>
Of
course
she
had
no
choice
but
to
yield
.
<EOS>
He
,
possessed
of
power
and
force
infinitely
greater
than
hers
,
had
left
her
no
alternative
but
to
be
happy
.
<EOS>
But
there
still
clung
to
her
what
I
fear
we
must
call
a
perverseness
of
obstinacy
,
a
desire
to
maintain
the
resolution
she
had
made
,
 
a
wish
that
she
might
be
allowed
to
undergo
the
punishment
she
had
deserved
.
<EOS>
She
was
as
a
prisoner
who
would
fain
cling
to
his
prison
after
pardon
has
reached
him
,
because
he
is
conscious
that
the
pardon
is
undeserved
.
<EOS>
And
it
may
be
that
there
was
still
left
within
her
bosom
some
remnant
of
that
feeling
of
rebellion
which
his
masterful
spirit
had
ever
produced
in
her
.
<EOS>
He
was
so
imperious
in
his
tranquillity
,
he
argued
his
question
of
love
with
such
a
manifest
preponderance
of
right
on
his
side
,
that
she
had
always
felt
that
to
yield
to
him
would
be
to
confess
the
omnipotence
of
his
power
.
<EOS>
She
knew
now
that
she
must
yield
to
him
,
 
that
his
power
over
her
was
omnipotent
.
<EOS>
She
was
pressed
by
him
as
in
some
countries
the
prisoner
is
pressed
by
the
judge
,
 
so
pressed
that
she
acknowledged
to
herself
silently
that
any
further
antagonism
to
him
was
impossible
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
the
word
which
she
had
to
speak
still
remained
unspoken
,
and
he
stood
over
her
,
waiting
for
her
answer
.
<EOS>
Then
slowly
he
sat
down
beside
her
,
and
gradually
he
put
his
arm
round
her
waist
.
<EOS>
She
shrank
from
him
,
back
against
the
stonework
of
the
embrasure
,
but
she
could
not
shrink
away
from
his
grasp
.
<EOS>
She
put
up
her
hand
to
impede
his
,
but
his
hand
,
like
his
character
and
his
words
,
was
full
of
power
.
<EOS>
It
would
not
be
impeded
.
<EOS>
"
Alice
,
"
he
said
,
as
he
pressed
her
close
with
his
arm
,
"
the
battle
is
over
now
,
and
I
have
won
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
win
everything
,
 
always
,
"
she
said
,
whispering
to
him
,
as
she
still
shrank
from
his
embrace
.
  
<EOS>
"
In
winning
you
I
have
won
everything
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Then
he
put
his
face
over
her
and
pressed
his
lips
to
hers
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
whether
he
was
made
happier
when
he
knew
that
no
other
touch
had
profaned
those
lips
since
last
he
had
pressed
them
?
   
<EOS>
Rouge
et
Noir
.
 
<EOS>
Alice
insisted
on
being
left
up
in
the
churchyard
,
urging
that
she
wanted
to
"
think
about
it
all
,
"
but
,
in
truth
,
fearing
that
she
might
not
be
able
to
carry
herself
well
,
if
she
were
to
walk
down
with
her
lover
to
the
hotel
.
<EOS>
To
this
he
made
no
objection
,
and
,
on
reaching
the
inn
,
met
Mr.
Palliser
in
the
hall
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
was
already
inspecting
the
arrangement
of
certain
large
trunks
which
had
been
brought
down
-
stairs
,
and
was
preparing
for
their
departure
.
<EOS>
He
was
going
about
the
house
,
with
a
nervous
solicitude
to
do
something
,
and
was
flattering
himself
that
he
was
of
use
.
<EOS>
As
he
could
not
be
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
,
and
as
,
by
the
nature
of
his
disposition
,
some
employment
was
necessary
to
him
,
he
was
looking
to
the
cording
of
the
boxes
.
"
<EOS>
Good
morning
!
<EOS>
good
morning
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
said
to
Grey
,
hardly
looking
at
him
,
as
though
time
were
too
precious
with
him
to
allow
of
his
turning
his
eyes
upon
his
friend
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
going
up
to
the
station
to
see
after
a
carriage
for
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
you
'll
come
with
me
.
"
<EOS>
To
this
proposition
Mr.
Grey
assented
.
<EOS>
"
Sometimes
,
you
know
,
"
continued
Mr.
Palliser
,
"
the
springs
of
the
carriages
are
so
very
rough
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Then
,
in
a
very
few
words
,
Mr.
Grey
told
him
what
had
been
his
own
morning
's
work
.
<EOS>
He
hated
secrets
and
secrecy
,
and
as
the
Pallisers
knew
well
what
had
brought
him
upon
their
track
,
it
was
,
he
thought
,
well
that
they
should
know
that
he
had
been
successful
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
congratulated
him
very
cordially
,
and
then
,
running
up
-
stairs
for
his
gloves
or
his
stick
,
or
,
more
probably
,
that
he
might
give
his
wife
one
other
caution
as
to
her
care
of
herself
,
he
told
her
also
that
Alice
had
yielded
at
last
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Of
course
she
has
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
really
did
n't
think
she
would
,
"
said
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
because
you
do
n't
understand
things
of
that
sort
,
"
said
his
wife
.
<EOS>
Then
the
caution
was
repeated
,
the
mother
of
the
future
duke
was
kissed
,
and
Mr.
Palliser
went
off
on
his
mission
about
the
carriage
,
its
cushions
,
and
its
springs
.
<EOS>
In
the
course
of
their
walk
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
suggested
that
,
as
things
were
settled
so
pleasantly
,
Mr.
Grey
might
as
well
return
with
them
to
England
,
and
to
this
suggestion
Mr.
Grey
assented
.
  
<EOS>
Alice
remained
alone
for
nearly
an
hour
,
looking
out
upon
the
rough
sides
and
gloomy
top
of
Mount
Pilate
.
<EOS>
No
one
disturbed
her
in
the
churchyard
,
 
<EOS>
no
steps
were
heard
along
the
tombstones
,
 
no
voice
sounded
through
the
cloisters
.
<EOS>
She
was
left
in
perfect
solitude
to
think
of
the
past
,
and
form
her
plans
of
the
future
.
<EOS>
Was
she
happy
<EOS>
,
now
that
the
manner
of
her
life
to
come
was
thus
settled
for
her
;
that
all
further
question
as
to
the
disposal
of
herself
was
taken
out
of
her
hands
,
and
that
her
marriage
with
a
man
she
loved
was
so
firmly
arranged
that
no
further
folly
of
her
own
could
disarrange
it
?
<EOS>
She
was
happy
,
though
she
was
slow
to
confess
her
happiness
to
herself
.
<EOS>
She
was
happy
,
and
she
was
resolute
in
this
,
 
that
she
would
now
do
all
she
could
to
make
him
happy
also
.
<EOS>
And
there
must
now
,
she
acknowledged
,
be
an
end
to
her
pride
,
 
to
that
pride
which
had
hitherto
taught
her
to
think
that
she
could
more
wisely
follow
her
own
guidance
than
that
of
any
other
who
might
claim
to
guide
her
.
<EOS>
She
knew
now
that
she
must
follow
his
guidance
.
<EOS>
She
had
found
her
master
,
as
we
sometimes
say
,
and
laughed
to
herself
with
a
little
inward
laughter
as
she
confessed
that
it
was
so
.
<EOS>
She
was
from
henceforth
altogether
in
his
hands
.
<EOS>
If
he
chose
to
tell
her
that
they
were
to
be
married
at
Michaelmas
,
or
at
Christmas
,
or
on
Lady
Day
,
they
would
,
of
course
,
be
married
accordingly
.
<EOS>
She
had
taken
her
fling
at
having
her
own
will
,
and
she
and
all
her
friends
had
seen
what
had
come
of
it
.
<EOS>
She
had
assumed
the
command
of
the
ship
,
and
had
thrown
it
upon
the
rocks
,
and
she
felt
that
she
never
ought
to
take
the
captain
's
place
again
.
<EOS>
It
was
well
for
her
that
he
who
was
to
be
captain
was
one
whom
she
respected
as
thoroughly
as
she
loved
him
.
  
<EOS>
She
would
write
to
her
father
at
once
,
 
to
her
father
and
Lady
Macleod
,
 
and
would
confess
everything
.
<EOS>
She
felt
that
she
owed
it
to
them
that
they
should
be
told
by
herself
that
they
had
been
right
and
that
she
had
been
wrong
.
<EOS>
Hitherto
<EOS>
she
had
not
mentioned
to
either
of
them
the
fact
that
Mr.
Grey
was
with
them
in
Switzerland
.
<EOS>
And
,
then
,
what
must
she
do
as
to
Lady
Midlothian
?
<EOS>
As
to
Lady
Midlothian
,
she
would
do
nothing
.
<EOS>
Lady
Midlothian
,
of
course
,
would
triumph
;
 
would
jump
upon
her
,
as
Lady
Glencora
had
once
expressed
it
,
with
very
triumphant
heels
,
 
would
try
to
patronize
her
,
or
,
which
would
be
almost
worse
,
would
make
a
parade
of
her
forgiveness
.
<EOS>
But
she
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
Lady
Midlothian
,
unless
,
indeed
,
Mr.
Grey
should
order
it
.
<EOS>
Then
she
laughed
at
herself
again
with
that
inward
laughter
,
and
,
rising
from
her
seat
,
proceeded
to
walk
down
the
hill
to
the
hotel
.
  
<EOS>
"
Vanquished
at
last
!
"
said
Lady
Glencora
,
as
Alice
entered
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
vanquished
;
if
you
like
to
call
it
so
,
"
said
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
what
I
call
it
,
but
what
you
feel
it
,
"
said
the
other
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Do
you
think
that
I
do
n't
know
you
well
enough
to
be
sure
that
you
regard
yourself
now
as
an
unfortunate
prisoner
,
 
as
a
captive
taken
in
war
,
to
be
led
away
in
triumph
,
without
any
hope
of
a
ransom
?
<EOS>
I
know
that
it
is
quite
a
misery
to
you
that
you
should
be
made
a
happy
woman
of
at
last
.
<EOS>
I
understand
it
all
,
<EOS>
my
dear
,
and
my
heart
bleeds
for
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
;
I
knew
that
was
the
way
you
would
treat
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
In
what
way
would
you
have
me
treat
you
?
<EOS>
If
I
were
to
hug
you
with
joy
,
and
tell
you
how
good
he
is
,
and
how
fortunate
you
are
,
 
if
I
were
to
praise
him
,
and
bid
you
triumph
in
your
success
,
as
might
be
expected
on
such
an
occasion
,
 
you
would
put
on
a
long
face
at
once
,
and
tell
me
that
though
the
thing
is
to
be
,
it
would
be
much
better
that
the
thing
should
n't
be
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
I
know
you
,
Alice
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
n't
have
said
that
;
 
not
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
in
my
heart
you
would
;
 
that
,
or
something
like
it
.
<EOS>
But
I
do
wish
you
joy
all
the
same
,
and
you
may
say
what
you
please
.
<EOS>
He
has
got
you
in
his
power
now
,
and
I
do
n't
think
even
you
can
go
back
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
I
shall
not
go
back
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
join
with
Lady
Midlothian
in
putting
you
into
a
madhouse
,
if
you
did
.
<EOS>
But
I
am
so
glad
;
I
am
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
I
was
afraid
to
the
last
,
 
terribly
afraid
;
you
are
so
hard
and
so
proud
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
mean
hard
to
me
,
dear
.
<EOS>
You
have
never
been
half
hard
enough
to
me
.
<EOS>
But
you
are
hard
to
yourself
,
and
,
upon
my
word
,
you
have
been
hard
to
him
.
<EOS>
What
a
deal
you
will
have
to
make
up
to
him
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
feel
that
I
ought
to
stand
before
him
always
as
a
penitent
,
 
in
a
white
sheet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
will
like
it
better
,
I
dare
say
,
if
you
will
sit
upon
his
knee
.
<EOS>
Some
penitents
do
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
And
how
happy
you
will
be
!
<EOS>
He
'll
never
explain
the
sugar
-
duties
to
you
,
and
there
'll
be
no
Mr.
Bott
at
Nethercoats
.
<EOS>
"
They
sat
together
the
whole
morning
,
 
while
Mr.
Palliser
was
seeing
to
the
springs
and
cushions
,
 
and
by
degrees
Alice
began
to
enjoy
her
happiness
.
<EOS>
As
she
did
so
her
friend
enjoyed
it
with
her
,
and
at
last
they
had
something
of
the
comfort
and
excitement
which
such
an
occasion
should
give
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
tell
you
what
,
Alice
;
you
shall
come
and
be
married
at
Matching
,
in
August
,
or
perhaps
September
.
<EOS>
That
's
the
only
way
in
which
I
can
be
present
;
and
if
we
can
bespeak
some
sun
,
we
'll
have
the
breakfast
out
in
the
ruins
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
On
the
following
morning
they
all
started
together
,
a
first
-
class
compartment
having
been
taken
for
the
Palliser
family
,
and
a
second
-
class
compartment
close
to
them
for
the
Palliser
servants
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
,
as
he
slowly
handed
his
wife
in
,
was
a
triumphant
man
;
as
was
also
Mr.
Grey
,
as
he
handed
in
his
lady
-
love
,
though
,
in
a
manner
,
much
less
manifest
.
<EOS>
We
may
say
that
both
the
gentlemen
had
been
very
fortunate
while
at
Lucerne
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
had
come
abroad
with
a
feeling
that
all
the
world
had
been
cut
from
under
his
feet
.
<EOS>
A
great
change
was
needed
for
his
wife
,
and
he
had
acknowledged
at
once
that
everything
must
be
made
to
yield
to
that
necessity
.
<EOS>
He
certainly
had
his
reward
,
 
now
in
his
triumphant
return
.
<EOS>
Terrible
troubles
had
afflicted
him
as
he
went
,
which
seemed
now
to
have
dissipated
themselves
altogether
.
<EOS>
When
he
thought
of
Burgo
Fitzgerald
he
remembered
him
only
as
a
poor
,
unfortunate
fellow
,
for
whom
he
should
be
glad
to
do
something
,
if
the
doing
of
anything
were
only
in
his
power
;
and
he
had
in
his
pocket
a
letter
which
he
had
that
morning
received
from
the
Duke
of
St.
Bungay
,
marked
private
and
confidential
,
which
was
in
its
nature
very
private
and
confidential
,
and
in
which
he
was
told
that
Lord
Brock
and
Mr.
Finespun
were
totally
at
variance
about
French
wines
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Finespun
wanted
to
do
something
,
now
in
the
recess
,
 
to
send
some
political
agent
over
to
France
,
 
to
which
Lord
Brock
would
not
agree
;
and
no
one
knew
what
would
be
the
consequence
of
this
disagreement
.
<EOS>
Here
might
be
another
chance
,
 
if
only
Mr.
Palliser
could
give
up
his
winter
in
Italy
!
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
,
as
he
took
his
place
opposite
his
wife
,
was
very
triumphant
.
  
<EOS>
And
Mr.
Grey
was
triumphant
,
as
he
placed
himself
gently
in
his
seat
opposite
to
Alice
.
<EOS>
He
seemed
to
assume
no
right
,
as
he
took
that
position
apparently
because
it
was
the
one
which
came
naturally
to
his
lot
.
<EOS>
No
one
would
have
been
made
aware
that
Alice
was
his
own
simply
by
seeing
his
arrangements
for
her
comfort
.
<EOS>
He
made
no
loud
assertion
as
to
his
property
and
his
rights
,
as
some
men
do
.
<EOS>
He
was
quiet
and
subdued
in
his
joy
,
but
not
the
less
was
he
triumphant
.
<EOS>
From
the
day
on
which
Alice
had
accepted
his
first
offer
,
 
nay
,
from
an
earlier
day
than
that
;
from
the
day
on
which
he
had
first
resolved
to
make
it
,
down
to
the
present
hour
,
he
had
never
been
stirred
from
his
purpose
.
<EOS>
By
every
word
that
he
had
said
,
and
by
every
act
that
he
had
done
,
he
had
shown
himself
to
be
unmoved
by
that
episode
in
their
joint
lives
,
which
Alice
's
other
friends
had
regarded
as
so
fatal
.
<EOS>
When
she
first
rejected
him
,
he
would
not
take
his
rejection
.
<EOS>
When
she
told
him
that
she
intended
to
marry
her
cousin
,
he
silently
declined
to
believe
that
such
marriage
would
ever
take
place
.
<EOS>
He
had
never
given
her
up
for
a
day
,
and
now
the
event
proved
that
he
had
been
right
.
<EOS>
Alice
was
happy
,
very
happy
;
but
she
was
still
disposed
to
regard
her
lover
as
Fate
,
and
her
happiness
as
an
enforced
necessity
.
  
<EOS>
They
stopped
a
night
at
Basle
,
and
again
she
stood
upon
the
balcony
.
<EOS>
He
was
close
to
her
as
she
stood
there
,
 
so
close
that
,
putting
out
her
hand
for
his
,
she
was
able
to
take
it
and
press
it
closely
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
thinking
of
something
,
Alice
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
What
is
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
here
,
"
she
said
 
"
here
,
on
this
very
balcony
,
that
I
first
rebelled
against
you
,
and
now
you
have
brought
me
here
that
I
should
confess
and
submit
on
the
same
spot
.
<EOS>
I
do
confess
.
<EOS>
How
am
I
to
thank
you
for
forgiving
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
On
the
following
morning
they
went
on
to
Baden
-
Baden
,
and
there
they
stopped
for
a
couple
of
days
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
had
positively
refused
to
stop
a
day
at
Basle
,
making
so
many
objections
to
the
place
that
her
husband
had
at
last
yielded
.
<EOS>
"
I
could
go
from
Vienna
to
London
without
feeling
it
,
"
she
said
,
with
indignation
;
"
and
to
tell
me
that
I
ca
n't
do
two
easy
days
"
journey
running
!
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
had
been
afraid
to
be
imperious
,
and
therefore
,
immediately
on
his
arrival
at
one
of
the
stations
in
Basle
,
he
had
posted
across
the
town
,
in
the
heat
and
the
dust
,
to
look
after
the
cushions
and
the
springs
at
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
've
a
particular
favour
to
ask
of
you
,
"
Lady
Glencora
said
to
her
husband
,
as
soon
as
they
were
alone
together
in
their
rooms
at
Baden
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
declared
that
he
would
grant
her
any
particular
favour
,
 
only
premising
that
he
was
not
to
be
supposed
to
have
thereby
committed
himself
to
any
engagement
under
which
his
wife
should
have
authority
to
take
any
exertion
upon
herself
.
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
were
a
milkmaid
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
are
not
a
milkmaid
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
You
have
n't
been
brought
up
like
a
milkmaid
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
But
what
was
the
favour
?
<EOS>
If
she
would
only
ask
for
jewels
,
 
though
they
were
the
Grand
Duchess
's
diamond
eardrops
,
he
would
endeavour
to
get
them
for
her
.
<EOS>
If
she
would
have
quaffed
molten
pearls
,
like
Cleopatra
,
he
would
have
procured
the
beverage
,
 
having
first
fortified
himself
with
a
medical
opinion
as
to
the
fitness
of
the
drink
for
a
lady
in
her
condition
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
expenditure
that
he
would
not
willingly
incur
for
her
,
nothing
costly
that
he
would
grudge
.
<EOS>
But
when
she
asked
for
a
favour
,
he
was
always
afraid
of
an
imprudence
.
<EOS>
Very
possibly
she
might
want
to
drink
beer
in
an
open
garden
.
  
<EOS>
And
her
request
was
,
at
last
,
of
this
nature
:
"
<EOS>
I
want
you
to
take
me
up
to
the
gambling
-
rooms
!
"
<EOS>
said
she
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
gambling
-
rooms
!
"
said
Mr.
Palliser
in
dismay
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Plantagenet
;
the
gambling
-
rooms
.
<EOS>
If
you
had
been
with
me
before
,
I
should
not
have
made
a
fool
of
myself
by
putting
my
piece
of
money
on
the
table
.
<EOS>
I
want
to
see
the
place
;
but
then
I
saw
nothing
,
because
I
was
so
frightened
when
I
found
that
I
was
winning
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
was
aware
that
all
the
world
of
Baden
,
 
or
rather
the
world
of
the
strangers
at
Baden
,
 
assembles
itself
in
those
salons
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
also
that
he
himself
was
curious
to
see
how
men
looked
when
they
lost
their
own
money
,
or
won
that
of
others
.
<EOS>
He
knew
how
a
Minister
looked
when
he
lost
or
gained
a
tax
.
<EOS>
He
was
familiar
with
millions
and
tens
of
millions
in
a
committee
of
the
whole
House
.
<EOS>
He
knew
the
excitement
of
a
near
division
upon
the
estimates
.
<EOS>
But
he
had
never
yet
seen
a
poor
man
stake
his
last
napoleon
,
and
rake
back
from
off
the
table
a
small
hatful
of
gold
.
<EOS>
A
little
exercise
after
an
early
dinner
was
,
he
had
been
told
,
good
for
his
wife
;
and
he
agreed
therefore
that
,
on
their
second
evening
at
Baden
,
they
would
all
walk
up
and
see
the
play
.
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
I
shall
get
back
my
napoleon
,
"
said
Glencora
to
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
perhaps
I
shall
be
forgiven
when
somebody
sees
how
difficult
it
is
to
manage
you
,
"
said
Alice
,
looking
at
Mr.
Palliser
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
is
n't
in
earnest
,
"
said
Mr.
Palliser
,
almost
fearing
the
result
of
the
experiment
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
that
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
.
  
<EOS>
They
started
together
,
Mr.
Palliser
with
his
wife
,
and
Mr.
Grey
with
Alice
on
his
arm
,
and
found
all
the
tables
at
work
.
<EOS>
They
at
first
walked
through
the
different
rooms
,
whispering
to
each
other
their
comments
on
the
people
that
they
saw
,
and
listening
to
the
quick
,
low
,
monotonous
words
of
the
croupiers
as
they
arranged
and
presided
over
the
games
.
<EOS>
Each
table
was
closely
surrounded
by
its
own
crowd
,
made
up
of
players
,
embryo
players
,
and
simple
lookers
-
on
,
so
that
they
could
not
see
much
as
they
walked
.
<EOS>
But
this
was
not
enough
for
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
She
was
anxious
to
know
what
these
men
and
women
were
doing
,
 
to
see
whether
the
croupiers
wore
horns
on
their
heads
and
were
devils
indeed
,
 
to
behold
the
faces
of
those
who
were
wretched
and
of
those
who
were
triumphant
,
 
to
know
how
the
thing
was
done
,
and
to
learn
something
of
that
lesson
in
life
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Let
us
stand
here
a
moment
,
"
she
said
to
her
husband
,
arresting
him
at
one
corner
of
the
table
which
had
the
greatest
crowd
.
<EOS>
"
We
shall
be
able
to
see
in
a
few
minutes
.
"
<EOS>
So
he
stood
with
her
there
,
giving
way
to
Alice
,
who
went
in
front
with
his
wife
;
and
in
a
minute
or
two
an
aperture
was
made
,
so
that
they
could
all
see
the
marked
cloth
,
and
the
money
lying
about
,
and
the
rakes
on
the
table
,
and
the
croupier
skilfully
dealing
his
cards
,
and
,
 
more
interesting
than
all
the
rest
,
the
faces
of
those
who
were
playing
.
<EOS>
Grey
looked
on
,
over
Alice
's
shoulder
,
very
attentively
,
 
as
did
Palliser
also
,
 
but
both
of
them
kept
their
eyes
upon
the
ministers
of
the
work
.
<EOS>
Alice
and
Glencora
did
the
same
at
first
,
but
as
they
gained
courage
they
glanced
round
upon
the
gamblers
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
long
table
,
having
,
of
course
,
four
corners
,
and
<EOS>
at
the
corner
appropriated
by
them
they
were
partly
opposite
to
the
man
who
dealt
the
cards
.
<EOS>
The
corner
answering
to
theirs
at
the
other
end
was
the
part
of
the
table
most
removed
from
their
sight
,
and
that
on
which
their
eyes
fell
last
.
<EOS>
As
Lady
Glencora
stood
she
could
hardly
see
,
 
indeed
,
at
first
she
could
not
see
,
 
one
or
two
who
were
congregated
at
this
spot
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
,
who
was
behind
her
,
could
not
see
them
at
all
.
<EOS>
But
to
Alice
,
 
and
to
Mr.
Grey
,
had
he
cared
about
it
,
 
every
face
at
the
table
was
visible
except
the
faces
of
those
who
were
immediately
close
to
them
.
<EOS>
Before
long
Alice
's
attention
was
riveted
on
the
action
and
countenance
of
one
young
man
who
sat
at
that
other
corner
.
<EOS>
He
was
leaning
,
at
first
listlessly
,
over
the
table
,
dressed
in
a
velveteen
jacket
,
and
with
his
round
-
topped
hat
brought
far
over
his
eyes
,
so
that
she
could
not
fully
see
his
face
.
<EOS>
But
she
had
hardly
begun
to
observe
him
before
he
threw
back
his
hat
,
and
taking
some
pieces
of
gold
from
under
his
left
hand
,
which
lay
upon
the
table
,
pushed
three
or
four
of
them
on
to
one
of
the
divisions
marked
on
the
cloth
.
<EOS>
He
seemed
to
show
no
care
,
as
others
did
,
as
to
the
special
spot
which
they
should
occupy
.
<EOS>
Many
were
very
particular
in
this
respect
,
placing
their
ventures
on
the
lines
,
so
as
to
share
the
fortunes
of
two
compartments
,
or
sometimes
of
four
;
or
they
divided
their
coins
,
taking
three
or
four
numbers
,
selecting
the
numbers
with
almost
grotesque
attention
to
some
imagined
rule
of
their
own
.
<EOS>
But
this
man
let
his
gold
go
all
together
,
and
left
it
where
his
half
-
stretched
rake
deposited
it
by
chance
.
<EOS>
Alice
could
not
but
look
at
his
face
.
<EOS>
His
eyes
she
could
see
were
bloodshot
,
and
his
hair
,
when
he
pushed
back
his
hat
,
was
rough
and
dishevelled
;
but
still
there
was
that
in
his
face
which
no
woman
could
see
and
not
regard
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
face
which
at
once
prepossessed
her
in
his
favour
,
 
as
it
had
always
prepossessed
all
others
.
<EOS>
On
this
occasion
he
had
won
his
money
,
and
Alice
saw
him
drag
it
in
as
lazily
as
he
had
pushed
it
out
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
see
that
little
Frenchman
?
"
said
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
"
He
has
just
made
half
a
napoleon
,
and
has
walked
off
with
it
.
<EOS>
Is
n't
it
interesting
?
<EOS>
I
could
stay
here
all
the
night
.
<EOS>
"
Then
she
turned
round
to
whisper
something
to
her
husband
,
and
Alice
's
eyes
again
fell
on
the
face
of
the
man
at
the
other
end
of
the
table
.
<EOS>
After
he
had
won
his
money
,
he
had
allowed
the
game
to
go
on
for
a
turn
without
any
action
on
his
part
.
<EOS>
The
gold
again
went
under
his
hand
,
and
he
lounged
forward
with
his
hat
over
his
eyes
.
<EOS>
One
of
the
croupiers
had
said
a
word
,
as
though
calling
his
attention
to
the
game
,
but
he
had
merely
shaken
his
head
.
<EOS>
But
when
the
fate
of
the
next
turn
had
been
decided
,
he
again
roused
himself
,
and
on
this
occasion
,
as
far
as
Alice
could
see
,
pushed
his
whole
stock
forward
with
the
rake
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
little
mass
of
gold
,
and
,
from
his
manner
of
placing
it
,
all
might
see
that
he
left
its
position
to
chance
.
<EOS>
One
piece
had
got
beyond
its
boundary
,
and
the
croupier
pushed
it
back
with
some
half
-
expressed
inquiry
as
to
his
correctness
.
<EOS>
"
All
right
,
"
said
a
voice
in
English
.
<EOS>
Then
Lady
Glencora
started
and
clutched
Alice
's
arm
with
her
hand
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
was
explaining
to
Mr.
Grey
,
behind
them
,
something
about
German
finance
as
connected
with
gambling
-
tables
,
and
did
not
hear
the
voice
,
or
see
his
wife
's
motion
.
<EOS>
I
need
hardly
tell
the
reader
that
the
gambler
was
Burgo
Fitzgerald
.
  
<EOS>
But
Lady
Glencora
said
not
a
word
,
 
not
as
yet
.
<EOS>
She
looked
forward
very
gently
,
but
still
with
eager
eyes
,
till
she
could
just
see
the
face
she
knew
so
well
.
<EOS>
His
hat
was
now
pushed
back
,
and
his
countenance
had
lost
its
listlessness
.
<EOS>
He
watched
narrowly
the
face
of
the
man
as
he
told
out
the
amount
of
the
cards
as
they
were
dealt
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
try
to
hide
his
anxiety
,
and
when
,
after
the
telling
of
some
six
or
seven
cards
,
he
heard
a
certain
number
named
,
and
a
certain
colour
called
,
he
made
some
exclamation
which
even
Glencora
could
not
hear
.
<EOS>
And
then
another
croupier
put
down
,
close
to
Burgo
's
money
,
certain
rolls
of
gold
done
up
in
paper
,
and
also
certain
loose
napoleons
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
does
n't
he
take
it
?
"
said
Lady
Glencora
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
taking
it
,
"
said
Alice
,
not
at
all
knowing
the
cause
of
her
cousin
's
anxiety
.
  
<EOS>
Burgo
had
paused
a
moment
,
and
then
prepared
to
rake
the
money
to
him
;
but
as
he
did
so
,
he
changed
his
mind
,
and
pushed
it
all
back
again
,
 
now
,
on
this
occasion
,
being
very
careful
to
place
it
on
its
former
spot
.
<EOS>
Both
Alice
and
Glencora
could
see
that
a
man
at
his
elbow
was
dissuading
him
,
 
had
even
attempted
to
stop
the
arm
which
held
the
rake
.
<EOS>
But
Burgo
shook
him
off
,
speaking
to
him
some
word
roughly
,
and
then
again
he
steadied
the
rolls
upon
their
appointed
place
.
<EOS>
The
croupier
who
had
paused
for
a
moment
now
went
on
quickly
with
his
cards
,
and
in
two
minutes
the
fate
of
Burgo
's
wealth
was
decided
.
<EOS>
It
was
all
drawn
back
by
the
croupier
's
unimpassioned
rake
,
and
the
rolls
of
gold
were
restored
to
the
tray
from
whence
they
had
been
taken
.
  
<EOS>
Burgo
looked
up
and
smiled
at
them
all
round
the
table
.
<EOS>
By
this
time
most
of
those
who
stood
around
were
looking
at
him
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
man
who
gathered
eyes
upon
him
wherever
he
might
be
,
or
whatever
he
was
doing
;
and
it
had
been
clear
that
he
was
very
intent
upon
his
fortune
,
and
on
the
last
occasion
the
amount
staked
had
been
considerable
.
<EOS>
He
knew
that
men
and
women
were
looking
at
him
,
and
therefore
he
smiled
faintly
as
he
turned
his
eyes
round
the
table
.
<EOS>
Then
he
got
up
,
and
,
putting
his
hands
in
his
trousers
pockets
,
whistled
as
he
walked
away
.
<EOS>
His
companion
followed
him
,
and
laid
a
hand
upon
his
shoulder
;
but
Burgo
shook
him
off
,
and
would
not
turn
round
.
<EOS>
He
shook
him
off
,
and
walked
on
whistling
,
the
length
of
the
whole
salon
.
  
<EOS>
"
Alice
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
,
"
it
is
Burgo
Fitzgerald
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
had
gone
so
deep
into
that
question
of
German
finance
that
he
had
not
at
all
noticed
the
gambler
.
<EOS>
"
Alice
,
what
can
we
do
for
him
?
<EOS>
It
is
Burgo
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
.
  
<EOS>
Many
eyes
were
now
watching
him
.
<EOS>
Used
as
he
was
to
the
world
and
to
misfortune
,
he
was
not
successful
in
his
attempt
to
bear
his
loss
with
a
show
of
indifference
.
<EOS>
The
motion
of
his
head
,
the
position
of
his
hands
,
the
tone
of
his
whistling
,
all
told
the
tale
.
<EOS>
Even
the
unimpassioned
croupiers
furtively
cast
an
eye
after
him
,
and
a
very
big
Guard
,
in
a
cocked
hat
,
and
uniform
,
and
sword
,
who
hitherto
had
hardly
been
awake
,
seemed
evidently
to
be
interested
by
his
movements
.
<EOS>
If
there
is
to
be
a
tragedy
at
these
places
,
 
and
tragedies
will
sometimes
occur
,
 
it
is
always
as
well
that
the
tragic
scene
should
be
as
far
removed
as
possible
from
the
salons
,
in
order
that
the
public
eye
should
not
suffer
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
and
Alice
had
left
their
places
,
and
had
shrunk
back
,
almost
behind
a
pillar
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Is
it
he
,
in
truth
?
"
<EOS>
Alice
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
In
very
truth
,
"
said
Glencora
.
<EOS>
"
What
can
I
do
?
<EOS>
Can
I
do
anything
?
<EOS>
Look
at
him
,
Alice
.
<EOS>
If
he
were
to
destroy
himself
,
what
should
I
do
then
?
"
  
<EOS>
Burgo
,
conscious
that
he
was
the
regarded
of
all
eyes
,
turned
round
upon
his
heel
and
again
walked
the
length
of
the
salon
.
<EOS>
He
knew
well
that
he
had
not
a
franc
left
in
his
possession
,
but
still
he
laughed
and
still
he
whistled
.
<EOS>
His
companion
,
whoever
he
might
be
,
had
slunk
away
from
him
,
not
caring
to
share
the
notoriety
which
now
attended
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
shall
I
do
,
Alice
?
"
said
Lady
Glencora
,
with
her
eyes
still
fixed
on
him
who
had
been
her
lover
.
  
<EOS>
"
Tell
Mr.
Palliser
,
"
whispered
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
immediately
ran
up
to
her
husband
,
and
took
him
away
from
Mr.
Grey
.
<EOS>
Rapidly
she
told
her
story
,
 
with
such
rapidity
that
Mr.
Palliser
could
hardly
get
in
a
word
.
"
<EOS>
Do
something
for
him
;
 
do
,
do
.
<EOS>
Unless
I
know
that
something
is
done
,
I
shall
die
.
<EOS>
You
need
n't
be
afraid
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
not
afraid
,
"
said
Mr.
Palliser
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
,
as
she
went
on
quickly
,
got
hold
of
her
husband
's
hand
,
and
caressed
it
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
so
good
,
"
said
she
.
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
let
him
out
of
your
sight
.
<EOS>
There
;
he
is
going
.
<EOS>
I
will
go
home
with
Mr.
Grey
.
<EOS>
I
will
be
ever
so
good
;
I
will
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
You
know
what
he
'll
want
,
and
for
my
sake
you
'll
let
him
have
it
.
<EOS>
But
do
n't
let
him
gamble
.
<EOS>
If
you
could
only
get
him
home
to
England
,
and
then
do
something
.
<EOS>
You
owe
him
something
,
Plantagenet
;
do
you
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
money
can
do
anything
,
he
shall
have
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
God
bless
you
,
dearest
!
<EOS>
I
shall
never
see
him
again
;
but
if
you
could
save
him
!
<EOS>
There
;
 
he
is
going
now
.
<EOS>
Go
;
 
go
.
"
<EOS>
She
pushed
him
forward
,
and
then
retreating
,
put
her
arm
within
Mr.
Grey
's
,
still
keeping
her
eye
upon
her
husband
.
  
<EOS>
Burgo
,
when
he
first
got
to
the
door
leading
out
of
the
salon
,
had
paused
a
moment
,
and
,
turning
round
,
had
encountered
the
big
gendarme
close
to
him
.
"
<EOS>
Well
,
old
Buffer
,
what
do
you
want
?
<EOS>
"
said
he
,
accosting
the
man
in
English
.
<EOS>
The
big
gendarme
simply
walked
on
through
the
door
,
and
said
nothing
.
<EOS>
Then
Burgo
also
passed
out
,
and
Mr.
Palliser
quickly
went
after
him
.
<EOS>
They
were
now
in
the
large
front
salon
,
from
whence
the
chief
door
of
the
building
opened
out
upon
the
steps
.
<EOS>
Through
this
door
Burgo
went
without
pausing
,
and
Mr.
Palliser
went
after
him
.
<EOS>
They
both
walked
to
the
end
of
the
row
of
buildings
,
and
then
Burgo
,
leaving
the
broad
way
,
turned
into
a
little
path
which
led
up
through
the
trees
to
the
hills
.
<EOS>
That
hillside
among
the
trees
is
a
popular
resort
at
Baden
,
during
the
day
;
but
now
,
at
nine
in
the
evening
,
it
was
deserted
.
<EOS>
Palliser
did
not
press
on
the
other
man
,
but
followed
him
,
and
did
not
accost
Burgo
till
he
had
thrown
himself
on
the
grass
beneath
a
tree
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
in
trouble
,
I
fear
,
Mr.
Fitzgerald
,
"
said
Mr.
Palliser
,
as
soon
as
he
was
close
at
Burgo
's
feet
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
will
go
home
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
has
something
to
do
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
to
Mr.
Grey
,
as
soon
as
the
two
men
had
disappeared
from
her
sight
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
that
a
friend
of
Mr.
Palliser
?
"
said
Mr.
Grey
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
 
that
is
,
he
knows
him
,
and
is
interested
about
him
.
<EOS>
Alice
,
shall
we
go
home
?
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
Mr.
Grey
,
you
must
not
ask
any
questions
.
<EOS>
He
,
 
Mr.
Palliser
,
will
tell
you
everything
when
he
sees
you
,
 
that
is
,
if
there
is
anything
to
be
told
.
"
Then
they
all
went
home
,
and
soon
separated
for
the
night
.
<EOS>
"
Of
course
I
shall
sit
up
for
him
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
to
Alice
,
"
but
I
will
do
it
in
my
own
room
.
<EOS>
You
can
tell
Mr.
Grey
,
if
you
like
.
"
<EOS>
But
Alice
told
nothing
to
Mr.
Grey
,
nor
did
Mr.
Grey
ask
any
questions
.
   
<EOS>
The
Landlord
's
Bill
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
in
trouble
,
Mr.
Fitzgerald
,
I
fear
,
"
said
Mr.
Palliser
,
standing
over
Burgo
as
he
lay
upon
the
ground
.
<EOS>
They
were
now
altogether
beyond
the
gas
-
lights
,
and
the
evening
was
dark
.
<EOS>
Burgo
,
too
,
was
lying
with
his
face
to
the
ground
,
expecting
that
the
footsteps
which
he
had
heard
would
pass
by
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Who
is
that
?
"
<EOS>
said
he
,
turning
round
suddenly
;
but
still
he
was
not
at
once
able
to
recognize
Mr.
Palliser
,
whose
voice
was
hardly
known
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
I
have
been
wrong
in
following
you
,
"
said
Mr.
Palliser
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
thought
you
were
in
distress
,
and
that
probably
I
might
help
you
.
<EOS>
My
name
is
Palliser
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Plantagenet
Palliser
?
"
said
Burgo
,
jumping
up
on
to
his
legs
and
looking
close
into
the
other
's
face
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
By
heavens
!
<EOS>
it
is
Plantagenet
Palliser
!
<EOS>
Well
,
Mr.
Palliser
,
what
do
you
want
of
me
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
be
of
some
use
to
you
,
if
I
can
.
<EOS>
I
and
my
wife
saw
you
leave
the
gaming
-
table
just
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
she
here
too
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
 
she
is
here
.
<EOS>
We
are
going
home
,
but
chance
brought
us
up
to
the
salon
.
<EOS>
She
seemed
to
think
that
you
are
in
distress
,
and
that
I
could
help
you
.
<EOS>
I
will
,
if
you
will
let
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
,
during
the
whole
interview
,
felt
that
he
could
afford
to
be
generous
.
<EOS>
He
knew
that
he
had
no
further
cause
for
fear
.
<EOS>
He
had
no
lingering
dread
of
this
poor
creature
who
stood
before
him
.
<EOS>
All
that
feeling
was
over
,
though
it
was
as
yet
hardly
four
months
since
he
had
been
sent
back
by
Mrs.
Marsham
to
Lady
Monk
's
house
to
save
his
wife
,
if
saving
her
were
yet
possible
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
she
is
here
,
is
she
;
 
and
saw
me
there
when
I
staked
my
last
chance
?
<EOS>
I
should
have
had
over
twenty
thousand
francs
now
,
if
the
cards
had
stood
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
cards
never
do
stand
to
any
one
,
Mr.
Fitzgerald
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Never
;
 
never
,
 
never
!
"
said
Burgo
.
<EOS>
"
At
any
rate
,
they
never
did
to
me
.
<EOS>
Nothing
ever
does
stand
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
want
twenty
thousand
francs
,
 
that
's
eight
hundred
pounds
,
I
think
 
I
can
let
you
have
it
without
any
trouble
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
devil
you
can
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
yes
.
<EOS>
As
I
am
travelling
with
my
family
 
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
whether
Mr.
Palliser
considered
himself
to
be
better
entitled
to
talk
of
his
family
than
he
had
been
some
three
or
four
weeks
back
 
<EOS>
"
As
I
am
travelling
with
my
family
,
I
have
been
obliged
to
carry
large
bills
with
me
,
and
I
can
accommodate
you
without
any
trouble
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
something
pleasant
in
this
,
which
made
Burgo
Fitzgerald
laugh
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
,
the
husband
of
Lady
Glencora
M'Cluskie
,
and
the
heir
of
the
Duke
of
Omnium
happening
to
have
money
with
him
!
<EOS>
As
if
Mr.
Palliser
could
not
bring
down
showers
of
money
in
any
quarter
of
the
globe
by
simply
holding
up
his
hand
.
<EOS>
And
then
to
talk
of
accommodating
him
,
 
Burgo
Fitzgerald
,
as
though
it
were
simply
a
little
matter
of
convenience
,
 
as
though
Mr.
Palliser
would
of
course
find
the
money
at
his
bankers
"
when
he
next
examined
his
book
!
<EOS>
Burgo
could
not
but
laugh
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
not
in
the
least
doubting
your
ability
to
raise
the
money
,
"
said
he
;
"
but
how
would
you
propose
to
get
it
back
again
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
would
be
at
your
convenience
,
"
said
Mr.
Palliser
,
who
hardly
knew
how
to
put
himself
on
a
proper
footing
with
his
companion
,
so
that
he
might
offer
to
do
something
effectual
for
the
man
's
aid
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
have
any
such
convenience
,
"
said
Burgo
.
<EOS>
"
Who
were
those
women
whose
tubs
always
had
holes
at
the
bottom
of
them
?
<EOS>
My
tub
always
has
such
a
hole
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
mean
the
daughters
of
Danaus
,
"
said
Mr.
Palliser
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
whose
daughters
they
were
,
but
you
might
just
as
well
lend
them
all
eight
hundred
pounds
apiece
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
were
so
many
of
them
,
"
said
Mr.
Palliser
,
trying
a
little
joke
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
as
you
are
only
one
I
shall
be
most
happy
,
as
I
said
before
,
to
be
of
service
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
They
were
now
walking
slowly
together
up
towards
the
hills
,
and
near
to
them
they
heard
a
step
.
<EOS>
Upon
this
,
Burgo
turned
round
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
see
that
fellow
?
"
said
he
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
,
who
was
somewhat
short
-
sighted
,
said
that
he
did
not
see
him
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
,
though
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
his
name
,
but
they
have
sent
him
out
from
the
hotel
with
me
,
to
see
what
I
do
with
myself
.
<EOS>
I
owe
them
six
or
seven
hundred
francs
,
and
they
want
to
turn
me
out
of
the
house
and
not
let
me
take
my
things
with
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
would
be
very
uncomfortable
,
"
said
Mr.
Palliser
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
uncomfortable
,
but
I
shall
be
too
many
for
them
.
<EOS>
If
they
keep
my
traps
they
shall
keep
me
.
<EOS>
They
think
I
'm
going
to
blow
my
brains
out
.
<EOS>
That
's
what
they
think
.
<EOS>
The
man
lets
me
go
far
enough
off
to
do
that
,
 
so
long
as
it
's
nowhere
about
the
house
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
're
not
thinking
of
such
a
thing
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
As
long
as
I
can
help
it
,
Mr.
Palliser
,
I
never
think
of
anything
.
"
<EOS>
The
stranger
was
now
standing
near
to
them
,
 
almost
so
near
that
he
might
hear
their
words
.
<EOS>
Burgo
,
perceiving
this
,
walked
up
to
him
,
and
,
speaking
in
bad
French
,
desired
him
to
leave
them
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
see
that
I
have
a
friend
with
me
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
a
friend
,
"
said
the
man
,
answering
in
bad
English
.
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
de
friend
can
advance
moneys
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Never
mind
what
he
can
do
,
"
said
Burgo
.
<EOS>
"
You
do
as
you
are
bid
,
and
leave
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Then
the
gentleman
from
the
hotel
retreated
down
the
hill
,
but
Mr.
Palliser
,
during
the
rest
of
the
interview
,
frequently
fancied
that
he
heard
the
man
's
footfall
at
no
great
distance
.
  
<EOS>
They
continued
to
walk
on
up
the
hill
very
slowly
,
and
it
was
some
time
before
Mr.
Palliser
knew
how
to
repeat
his
offer
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
Lady
Glencora
is
here
?
"
<EOS>
Burgo
said
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
she
is
here
.
<EOS>
It
was
she
who
asked
me
to
come
to
you
,
"
Mr.
Palliser
answered
.
<EOS>
Then
they
both
walked
on
a
few
steps
in
silence
,
for
neither
of
them
knew
how
to
address
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
"
By
George
!
 
<EOS>
is
n't
it
odd
,
"
said
Burgo
,
at
last
,
"
that
you
and
I
,
of
all
men
in
the
world
,
should
be
walking
together
here
at
Baden
?
<EOS>
It
's
not
only
that
you
're
the
richest
man
in
London
,
and
that
I
'm
the
poorest
,
but
 
;
there
are
other
things
,
you
know
,
which
make
it
so
funny
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
have
been
things
which
make
me
and
my
wife
very
anxious
to
give
you
aid
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
have
you
considered
,
Mr.
Palliser
,
that
those
things
make
you
the
very
man
in
the
world
,
 
indeed
,
for
the
matter
of
that
,
the
only
man
in
the
world
,
 
from
whom
I
ca
n't
take
aid
.
<EOS>
I
would
have
taken
it
all
if
I
could
have
got
it
,
 
<EOS>
and
I
tried
hard
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
you
have
been
disappointed
,
Mr.
Fitzgerald
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Disappointed
!
<EOS>
By
G
 
---
!
<EOS>
yes
.
<EOS>
Did
you
ever
know
any
man
who
had
so
much
right
to
be
disappointed
as
I
have
?
<EOS>
I
did
love
her
,
Mr.
Palliser
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
by
heavens
!
<EOS>
I
do
love
her
.
<EOS>
Out
here
I
will
dare
to
say
as
much
even
to
you
.
<EOS>
I
shall
never
try
to
see
her
again
.
<EOS>
All
that
is
over
,
of
course
.
<EOS>
I
've
been
a
fool
about
her
as
I
have
been
about
everything
.
<EOS>
But
I
did
love
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
it
,
Mr.
Fitzgerald
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
not
altogether
her
money
.
<EOS>
But
think
what
it
would
have
been
to
me
,
Mr.
Palliser
.
<EOS>
Think
what
a
chance
I
had
,
and
what
a
chance
I
lost
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
been
at
the
top
of
everything
,
 
as
now
I
am
at
the
bottom
.
<EOS>
I
should
not
have
spent
that
.
<EOS>
There
would
have
been
enough
of
it
to
have
saved
me
.
<EOS>
And
then
I
might
have
done
something
good
instead
of
crawling
about
almost
in
fear
of
that
beast
who
is
watching
us
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
has
been
ordered
otherwise
,
"
said
Mr.
Palliser
,
not
knowing
what
to
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
it
has
been
ordered
,
with
a
vengeance
!
<EOS>
It
seems
to
have
been
ordered
that
I
'm
to
go
to
the
devil
;
but
I
do
n't
know
who
gave
the
orders
,
and
I
do
n't
know
why
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
had
not
time
to
explain
to
his
friend
that
the
orders
had
been
given
,
in
a
very
peremptory
way
,
by
himself
,
as
he
was
anxious
to
bring
back
the
conversation
to
his
own
point
.
<EOS>
He
wished
to
give
some
serviceable
,
and
,
if
possible
,
permanent
aid
to
the
poor
ne'er
-
do
-
well
;
but
he
did
not
wish
to
talk
more
than
could
be
helped
about
his
own
wife
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
an
old
saying
,
which
you
will
remember
well
,
"
said
he
,
"
that
the
way
to
good
manners
is
never
too
late
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
nonsense
,
"
said
Burgo
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
too
late
when
the
man
feels
the
knot
round
his
neck
at
the
Old
Bailey
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Perhaps
not
,
even
then
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
we
may
say
,
certainly
not
,
if
the
man
be
still
able
to
take
the
right
way
.
<EOS>
But
I
do
n't
want
to
preach
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
would
n't
do
any
good
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
do
want
to
be
of
service
to
you
.
<EOS>
There
is
something
of
truth
in
what
you
say
.
<EOS>
You
have
been
disappointed
;
and
<EOS>
I
,
perhaps
,
of
all
men
am
the
most
bound
to
come
to
your
assistance
now
that
you
are
in
need
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
can
I
take
it
from
you
?
"
<EOS>
said
Burgo
,
almost
crying
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
shall
take
it
from
her
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
 
that
would
be
worse
;
twenty
times
worse
.
<EOS>
What
!
<EOS>
take
her
money
,
when
she
would
not
give
me
herself
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
see
why
you
should
not
borrow
her
money
,
 
or
mine
.
<EOS>
You
shall
call
it
which
you
will
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
I
wo
n't
have
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
will
you
do
then
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
will
I
do
?
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
That
's
the
question
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
what
I
will
do
.
<EOS>
I
have
the
key
of
my
bedroom
in
my
pocket
,
and
I
will
go
to
bed
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
It
's
not
very
often
that
I
look
forward
much
beyond
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
let
me
call
on
you
,
to
-
morrow
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
see
what
good
it
will
do
?
<EOS>
I
sha
n't
get
up
till
late
,
<EOS>
for
fear
they
should
shut
the
room
against
me
.
<EOS>
I
might
as
well
have
as
much
out
of
them
as
I
can
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
shall
say
I
'm
ill
,
and
keep
my
bed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
take
a
few
napoleons
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
not
a
rap
.
<EOS>
Not
from
you
.
<EOS>
You
are
the
first
man
from
whom
I
ever
refused
to
borrow
money
,
and
I
should
say
that
you
'll
be
about
the
last
to
offer
to
lend
it
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
what
else
I
can
offer
?
"
said
Mr.
Palliser
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
can
offer
nothing
.
<EOS>
If
you
will
say
to
your
wife
from
me
that
I
bade
her
adieu
;
 
that
is
all
you
can
do
for
me
.
<EOS>
Good
night
,
Mr.
Palliser
;
good
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
left
him
and
went
his
way
,
feeling
that
he
had
no
further
eloquence
at
his
command
.
<EOS>
He
shook
Burgo
's
hand
,
and
then
walked
quickly
down
the
hill
.
<EOS>
As
he
did
so
he
passed
,
or
would
have
passed
the
man
who
had
been
dodging
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
Misther
,
Misther
!
"
said
the
man
in
a
whisper
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
want
of
me
?
"
asked
Mr.
Palliser
,
in
French
.
  
<EOS>
Then
the
man
spoke
in
French
,
also
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Has
he
got
any
money
?
<EOS>
Have
you
given
him
any
money
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
given
him
any
money
,
"
said
Mr.
Palliser
,
not
quite
knowing
what
he
had
better
do
or
say
under
such
circumstances
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
he
will
have
a
bad
time
with
it
,
"
said
the
man
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
he
might
have
carried
away
two
thousand
francs
just
now
!
<EOS>
Dear
,
dear
,
dear
!
<EOS>
Has
he
got
any
friends
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
he
has
friends
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
that
I
can
assist
him
,
or
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Fitzgerald
;
 
his
name
is
Fitzgerald
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Mr.
Palliser
;
"
his
name
is
Fitzgerald
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
There
are
so
many
Fitzgeralds
in
England
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Fitzgerald
,
London
;
 
he
has
no
other
address
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
he
had
,
and
I
knew
it
,
I
should
not
give
it
you
without
his
sanction
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
what
shall
we
do
?
<EOS>
How
shall
we
act
?
<EOS>
Perhaps
with
his
own
hand
he
will
himself
kill
.
<EOS>
For
five
weeks
his
pension
he
owes
;
<EOS>
yes
,
for
five
weeks
.
<EOS>
And
for
wine
,
oh
so
much
!
<EOS>
There
came
through
Baden
a
my
lord
,
and
then
,
I
think
he
got
money
.
<EOS>
But
he
went
and
played
.
<EOS>
That
was
of
course
.
<EOS>
But
;
oh
my
G
 
---
!
he
might
have
carried
away
this
night
two
thousand
francs
;
yes
,
two
thousand
francs
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
the
hotelkeeper
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
His
friend
,
sir
;
only
his
friend
.
<EOS>
That
is
,
I
am
the
head
Commissionaire
.
<EOS>
I
look
after
the
gentlemen
who
sometimes
are
not
all
 
not
all
 
<EOS>
"
exactly
what
they
should
be
,
the
commissioner
intended
to
explain
;
and
Mr.
Palliser
understood
him
although
the
words
were
not
quite
spoken
.
<EOS>
The
interview
was
ended
by
Mr.
Palliser
taking
the
name
of
the
hotel
,
and
promising
to
call
before
Mr.
Fitzgerald
should
be
up
in
the
morning
 
a
purposed
visit
,
which
we
need
not
regard
as
requiring
any
very
early
energy
on
Mr.
Palliser
's
part
,
when
we
remember
Burgo
's
own
programme
for
the
following
day
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
received
her
husband
that
night
with
infinite
anxiety
,
and
was
by
no
means
satisfied
with
what
had
been
done
.
<EOS>
He
described
to
her
as
accurately
as
he
could
the
nature
of
his
interview
with
Burgo
,
and
he
described
to
her
also
his
other
interview
with
the
head
commissioner
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
will
;
he
will
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
;
when
she
heard
from
her
husband
<EOS>
the
man
's
surmise
that
perhaps
he
might
destroy
himself
.
"
<EOS>
He
will
;
he
will
;
and
if
he
does
,
how
can
you
expect
that
I
shall
bear
it
?
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
tried
to
soothe
her
by
telling
her
of
his
promised
visit
to
the
landlord
;
and
Lady
Glencora
,
accepting
this
as
something
,
strove
to
instigate
her
husband
to
some
lavish
expenditure
on
Burgo
's
behalf
.
<EOS>
"
There
can
be
no
reason
why
he
should
not
take
it
,
"
said
Glencora
.
<EOS>
"
None
the
least
.
<EOS>
Had
it
not
been
promised
to
him
?
<EOS>
Had
he
not
a
right
to
it
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
subject
was
one
which
Mr.
Palliser
found
it
very
hard
to
discuss
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
tell
his
wife
that
Fitzgerald
ought
to
accept
his
bounty
;
but
he
assured
her
that
his
money
should
be
forthcoming
,
almost
to
any
extent
,
if
it
could
be
made
available
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
following
morning
he
went
down
to
the
hotel
,
and
saw
the
real
landlord
.
<EOS>
He
found
him
to
be
a
reasonable
,
tranquil
,
and
very
good
-
natured
man
,
 
who
was
possessed
by
a
not
irrational
desire
that
his
customers
"
bills
should
be
paid
;
but
who
seemed
to
be
much
less
eager
on
the
subject
than
are
English
landlords
in
general
.
<EOS>
His
chief
anxiety
seemed
to
arise
from
the
great
difficulty
of
doing
anything
with
the
gentleman
who
was
now
lying
in
his
bed
up
-
stairs
.
"
<EOS>
Has
he
had
any
breakfast
?
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
Breakfast
!
<EOS>
Oh
yes
;
"
and
the
landlord
laughed
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
very
particular
in
the
orders
he
had
given
.
<EOS>
He
had
desired
his
cutlets
to
be
dressed
in
a
particular
way
,
 
with
a
great
deal
of
cayenne
pepper
,
and
they
had
been
so
dressed
.
<EOS>
He
had
ordered
a
bottle
of
Sauterne
;
but
the
landlord
had
thought
,
or
the
head
-
waiter
acting
for
him
had
thought
,
that
a
bottle
of
ordinary
wine
of
the
country
would
do
as
well
.
<EOS>
The
bottle
of
ordinary
wine
of
the
country
had
just
that
moment
been
sent
up
-
stairs
.
  
<EOS>
Then
Mr.
Palliser
sat
down
in
the
landlord
's
little
room
,
and
had
Burgo
Fitzgerald
's
bill
brought
to
him
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
might
venture
to
pay
it
,
"
said
Mr.
Palliser
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
was
as
monsieur
pleased
,
"
said
the
landlord
,
with
something
like
a
sparkle
in
his
eye
.
  
<EOS>
What
was
Mr.
Palliser
to
do
?
<EOS>
He
did
not
know
whether
,
in
accordance
with
the
rules
of
the
world
in
which
he
lived
,
he
ought
to
pay
it
,
or
ought
to
leave
it
;
and
certainly
the
landlord
could
not
tell
him
.
<EOS>
Then
he
thought
of
his
wife
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
go
back
to
his
wife
without
having
done
something
;
so
,
as
a
first
measure
,
he
paid
the
bill
.
<EOS>
The
landlord
's
eyes
glittered
,
and
he
receipted
it
in
the
most
becoming
manner
.
  
<EOS>
"
Should
he
now
send
up
the
bottle
of
Sauterne
?
"
 
<EOS>
but
to
this
Mr.
Palliser
demurred
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
to
whom
should
the
receipted
bill
be
given
?
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
thought
that
the
landlord
had
better
keep
it
himself
for
a
while
.
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
there
is
some
little
difficulty
?
"
suggested
the
landlord
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
acknowledged
that
there
was
a
little
difficulty
.
<EOS>
He
knew
that
he
must
do
something
more
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
simply
pay
the
bill
and
go
away
.
<EOS>
That
would
not
satisfy
his
wife
.
<EOS>
He
knew
that
he
must
do
something
more
;
but
how
was
he
to
do
it
?
<EOS>
So
at
last
he
let
the
landlord
into
his
confidence
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
tell
the
whole
of
Burgo
's
past
history
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
tell
that
little
episode
in
Burgo
's
life
which
referred
to
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
But
he
did
make
the
landlord
understand
that
he
was
willing
to
administer
money
to
Mr.
Fitzgerald
,
if
only
it
could
only
be
administered
judiciously
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
ca
n't
keep
him
out
of
the
gambling
salon
,
you
know
,
sir
;
that
is
,
not
if
he
has
a
franc
in
his
pocket
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
to
that
the
landlord
was
very
confident
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
at
last
arranged
,
that
the
landlord
was
to
tell
Burgo
that
his
bill
did
not
signify
at
present
,
and
that
the
use
of
the
hotel
was
to
be
at
Burgo
's
command
for
the
next
three
months
.
<EOS>
At
the
end
of
that
time
he
was
to
have
notice
to
quit
.
<EOS>
No
money
was
to
be
advanced
to
him
;
 
but
the
landlord
,
even
in
this
respect
,
had
a
discretion
.
  
<EOS>
"
When
I
get
home
,
I
will
see
what
can
be
done
with
his
relations
there
,
"
said
Mr.
Palliser
.
<EOS>
Then
he
went
home
and
told
his
wife
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
he
'll
have
no
clothes
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
said
that
the
judicious
landlord
would
manage
that
also
;
and
in
that
way
Lady
Glencora
was
appeased
,
 
appeased
,
till
something
final
could
be
done
for
the
young
man
,
on
Mr.
Palliser
's
return
home
.
  
<EOS>
Poor
Burgo
!
<EOS>
He
must
now
be
made
to
end
his
career
as
far
as
these
pages
are
concerned
.
<EOS>
He
soon
found
that
something
had
been
done
for
him
at
the
hotel
,
and
no
doubt
he
must
have
made
some
guess
near
the
truth
.
<EOS>
The
discreet
landlord
told
him
nothing
,
 
would
tell
him
nothing
;
but
that
his
bill
did
not
signify
as
yet
.
<EOS>
Burgo
,
thinking
about
it
,
resolved
to
write
about
it
in
an
indignant
strain
to
Mr.
Palliser
;
but
the
letter
did
not
get
itself
written
.
<EOS>
When
in
England
,
Mr.
Palliser
saw
Sir
Cosmo
Monk
,
and
with
many
apologies
,
told
him
what
he
had
done
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
regret
it
,
"
said
Sir
Cosmo
,
in
anger
.
<EOS>
"
I
regret
it
;
not
for
the
money
's
sake
,
but
I
regret
it
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
amount
expended
,
was
however
repaid
to
Mr.
Palliser
,
and
an
arrangement
was
made
for
remitting
a
weekly
sum
of
fifteen
pounds
to
Burgo
,
through
a
member
of
the
diplomatic
corps
,
as
long
as
he
should
remain
at
a
certain
small
German
town
which
was
indicated
,
and
in
which
there
was
no
public
gambling
-
table
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
expressed
herself
satisfied
for
the
present
;
but
I
must
doubt
whether
poor
Burgo
lived
long
in
comfort
on
the
allowance
made
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
Here
we
must
say
farewell
to
Burgo
Fitzgerald
.
   
<EOS>
The
Travellers
Return
Home
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
did
not
remain
long
in
Baden
after
the
payment
of
Burgo
's
bill
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
I
shall
not
throw
any
undeserved
discredit
on
his
courage
if
I
say
that
he
was
afraid
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
What
would
he
have
said
,
 
what
would
he
have
been
able
to
say
,
if
that
young
man
had
come
to
him
demanding
an
explanation
?
<EOS>
So
he
hurried
away
to
Strasbourg
the
same
day
,
much
to
his
wife
's
satisfaction
.
  
<EOS>
The
journey
home
from
thence
was
not
marked
by
any
incidents
.
<EOS>
Gradually
Mr.
Palliser
became
a
little
more
lenient
to
his
wife
and
slightly
less
oppressive
in
his
caution
.
<EOS>
If
he
still
inquired
about
the
springs
of
the
carriages
,
he
did
so
in
silence
,
and
he
ceased
to
enjoin
the
necessity
of
a
day
's
rest
after
each
day
's
journey
.
<EOS>
By
the
time
that
they
reached
Dover
he
had
become
so
used
to
his
wife
's
condition
that
he
made
but
<EOS>
little
fluttering
as
she
walked
out
of
the
boat
by
that
narrow
gangway
which
is
so
contrived
as
to
make
an
arrival
there
a
serious
inconvenience
to
a
lady
,
and
a
nuisance
even
to
a
man
.
<EOS>
He
was
somewhat
staggered
when
a
big
man
,
in
the
middle
of
the
night
,
insisted
on
opening
the
little
basket
which
his
wife
carried
,
and
was
uncomfortable
when
obliged
to
stop
her
on
the
plank
while
he
gave
up
the
tickets
which
he
thought
had
been
already
surrendered
;
but
he
was
becoming
used
to
his
position
,
and
bore
himself
like
a
man
.
  
<EOS>
During
their
journey
home
Mr.
Palliser
had
by
no
means
kept
his
seat
opposite
to
Lady
Glencora
with
constancy
.
<EOS>
He
had
soon
found
that
it
was
easier
to
talk
to
Mr.
Grey
than
to
his
wife
,
and
,
consequently
,
the
two
ladies
had
been
much
together
,
as
had
also
the
two
gentlemen
.
<EOS>
What
the
ladies
discussed
may
be
imagined
.
<EOS>
One
was
about
to
become
a
wife
and
the
other
a
mother
,
and
that
was
to
be
their
fate
after
each
had
made
up
her
mind
that
no
such
lot
was
to
be
hers
.
<EOS>
It
may
,
however
,
be
presumed
that
for
every
one
word
that
Alice
spoke
Lady
Glencora
spoke
ten
.
<EOS>
The
two
men
,
throughout
these
days
of
close
intimacy
,
were
intent
upon
politics
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
,
who
may
be
regarded
as
the
fox
who
had
lost
his
tail
,
 
the
tail
being
,
in
this
instance
,
the
comfort
of
domestic
privacy
,
 
was
eager
in
recommending
his
new
friend
to
cut
off
his
tail
also
.
"
<EOS>
Your
argument
would
be
very
well
,
"
said
he
,
"
if
men
were
to
be
contented
to
live
for
themselves
only
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Your
argument
would
be
very
well
,
"
said
the
other
,
"
if
it
were
used
to
a
man
who
felt
that
he
could
do
good
to
others
by
going
into
public
life
.
<EOS>
But
it
is
wholly
inefficacious
if
it
recommends
public
life
simply
or
chiefly
because
a
man
may
gratify
his
own
ambition
by
public
services
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
there
is
personal
gratification
,
and
of
course
there
is
good
done
,
"
said
Mr.
Palliser
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
,
 
or
should
be
,
"
said
Mr.
Grey
.
  
<EOS>
"
Exactly
;
and
the
two
things
must
go
together
.
<EOS>
The
chief
gratification
comes
from
the
feeling
that
you
are
of
use
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
if
you
feel
that
you
would
not
be
of
use
?
"
  
We
need
not
follow
the
argument
any
further
.
<EOS>
We
all
know
its
nature
,
and
what
between
two
such
men
would
be
said
on
both
sides
.
<EOS>
We
all
know
that
neither
of
them
would
put
the
matter
altogether
in
a
true
light
.
<EOS>
Men
never
can
do
so
in
words
,
let
the
light
within
themselves
be
ever
so
clear
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
that
any
man
yet
ever
had
such
a
gift
of
words
as
to
make
them
a
perfect
exponent
of
all
the
wisdom
within
him
.
<EOS>
But
the
effect
was
partly
that
which
the
weaker
man
of
the
two
desired
,
 
the
weaker
in
the
gifts
of
nature
,
though
art
had
in
some
respects
made
him
stronger
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Grey
was
shaken
in
his
quiescent
philosophy
,
and
startled
Alice
,
 
startled
her
as
much
as
he
delighted
her
,
 
by
a
word
or
two
<EOS>
he
said
as
he
walked
with
her
in
the
courts
of
the
Louvre
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
all
hollow
here
,
"
he
said
,
speaking
of
French
politics
.
  
<EOS>
"
Very
hollow
,
"
said
Alice
,
who
had
no
love
for
the
French
mode
of
carrying
on
public
affairs
.
  
<EOS>
"
Of
all
modes
of
governing
this
seems
to
me
to
be
the
surest
of
coming
to
a
downfall
.
<EOS>
Men
are
told
that
they
are
wise
enough
to
talk
,
but
not
wise
enough
to
have
any
power
of
action
.
<EOS>
It
is
as
though
men
were
cautioned
that
they
were
walking
through
gunpowder
,
and
that
no
fire
could
be
allowed
them
,
but
were
at
the
same
time
enjoined
to
carry
lucifer
matches
in
their
pockets
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
believe
in
the
gunpowder
,
and
I
think
there
should
be
fire
,
and
plenty
of
it
;
but
if
I
did
n't
want
the
fire
I
would
n't
have
the
matches
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
so
odd
to
hear
you
talk
politics
,
"
said
Alice
,
laughing
.
  
<EOS>
After
this
he
dropped
the
subject
for
a
while
,
as
though
he
were
ashamed
of
it
,
but
in
a
very
few
minutes
he
returned
to
it
manfully
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
wants
me
to
go
into
Parliament
.
"
<EOS>
Upon
hearing
this
Alice
said
nothing
.
<EOS>
She
was
afraid
to
speak
.
<EOS>
After
all
that
had
passed
she
felt
that
it
would
not
become
her
to
show
much
outward
joy
on
hearing
such
a
proposition
,
so
spoken
by
him
,
and
yet
she
could
say
nothing
without
some
sign
of
exultation
in
her
voice
.
<EOS>
So
she
walked
on
without
speaking
,
and
was
conscious
that
her
fingers
trembled
on
his
arm
.
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
say
about
it
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
I
say
?
<EOS>
Oh
,
John
,
what
right
can
I
have
to
say
anything
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
one
else
can
have
so
much
right
,
 
putting
aside
of
course
myself
,
who
must
be
responsible
for
my
own
actions
.
<EOS>
He
asked
me
whether
I
could
afford
it
,
and
he
seems
to
think
that
a
smaller
income
suffices
for
such
work
now
than
it
did
a
few
years
since
.
<EOS>
I
believe
that
I
could
afford
it
,
if
I
could
get
a
seat
that
was
not
very
expensive
at
the
first
outset
.
<EOS>
He
could
help
me
there
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
On
that
point
,
of
course
,
I
can
have
no
opinion
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
No
;
not
on
that
point
.
<EOS>
I
believe
we
may
take
that
for
granted
.
<EOS>
Living
in
London
for
four
or
five
months
in
the
year
might
be
managed
.
<EOS>
But
as
to
the
mode
of
life
!
"
  
Then
Alice
was
unable
to
hold
her
tongue
longer
,
and
spoke
out
her
thoughts
with
more
vehemence
than
discretion
.
<EOS>
No
doubt
he
combated
them
with
some
amount
of
opposition
.
<EOS>
He
seldom
allowed
out
-
spoken
enthusiasm
to
pass
by
him
without
some
amount
of
hostility
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
not
so
perverse
as
to
be
driven
from
his
new
views
by
the
fact
that
Alice
approved
them
,
and
<EOS>
she
,
as
she
drew
near
home
,
was
able
to
think
that
the
only
flaw
in
his
character
was
in
process
of
being
cured
.
  
<EOS>
When
they
reached
London
they
all
separated
.
<EOS>
It
was
Mr.
Palliser
's
purpose
to
take
his
wife
down
to
Matching
with
as
little
delay
as
possible
.
<EOS>
London
was
at
this
time
nearly
empty
,
and
all
the
doings
of
the
season
were
over
.
<EOS>
It
was
now
the
first
week
of
August
,
and
as
Parliament
had
not
been
sitting
for
nearly
two
months
,
the
town
looked
as
it
usually
looks
in
September
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
was
to
stay
but
one
day
in
Park
Lane
,
and
it
had
been
understood
between
her
and
Alice
that
they
were
not
to
see
each
other
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
odd
it
is
parting
in
this
way
,
when
people
have
been
together
so
long
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
"
It
always
seems
as
though
there
had
been
a
separate
little
life
of
its
own
which
was
now
to
be
brought
to
a
close
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
,
Mr.
Grey
,
you
and
I
,
when
we
next
meet
,
will
be
far
too
distant
to
fight
with
each
other
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
that
may
never
be
the
case
,
"
said
Mr.
Grey
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
nothing
would
prevent
his
fighting
;
would
it
Alice
?
<EOS>
But
,
remember
,
there
must
be
no
fighting
when
we
do
meet
next
,
and
that
must
be
in
September
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
With
all
my
heart
,
"
said
Mr.
Grey
.
<EOS>
But
Alice
said
nothing
.
  
<EOS>
Then
Mr.
Palliser
made
his
little
speech
.
<EOS>
"
Alice
,
"
he
said
,
as
he
gave
his
hand
to
Miss
Vavasor
,
"
give
my
compliments
to
your
father
,
and
tell
him
that
I
shall
take
the
liberty
of
asking
him
to
come
down
to
Matching
for
the
early
shooting
in
September
,
and
that
I
shall
expect
him
to
bring
you
with
him
.
<EOS>
You
may
tell
him
also
that
he
will
have
to
stay
to
see
you
off
,
but
that
he
will
not
be
allowed
to
take
you
away
.
"
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
thought
that
this
was
very
pretty
as
coming
from
her
husband
,
and
so
she
told
him
on
their
way
home
.
  
<EOS>
Alice
insisted
on
going
to
Queen
Anne
Street
in
a
cab
by
herself
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
had
offered
a
carriage
,
and
Mr.
Grey
,
of
course
,
offered
himself
as
a
protector
;
but
she
would
have
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
.
<EOS>
If
he
had
gone
with
her
he
might
by
chance
have
met
her
father
,
and
she
was
most
anxious
that
she
should
not
be
encumbered
by
her
lover
's
presence
when
she
first
received
her
father
's
congratulations
.
<EOS>
They
had
slept
at
Dover
,
and
had
come
up
by
a
mid
-
day
train
.
<EOS>
When
she
reached
Queen
Anne
Street
,
the
house
was
desolate
,
and
she
might
therefore
have
allowed
Mr.
Grey
to
attend
her
.
<EOS>
But
she
found
a
letter
waiting
for
her
which
made
her
for
the
moment
forget
both
him
and
her
father
.
<EOS>
Lady
Macleod
,
at
Cheltenham
,
was
very
ill
,
and
wished
to
see
her
niece
,
as
she
said
,
before
she
died
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
got
your
letter
,
"
said
the
kind
old
woman
,
"
and
am
now
quite
happy
.
<EOS>
It
only
wanted
that
to
reconcile
me
to
my
departure
.
<EOS>
I
thought
through
it
all
that
my
girl
would
be
happy
at
last
.
<EOS>
Will
she
forgive
me
if
I
say
that
I
have
forgiven
her
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
letter
then
went
on
to
beg
Alice
to
come
to
Cheltenham
at
once
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
that
I
am
dying
now
,
"
said
Lady
Macleod
,
"
though
you
will
find
me
much
altered
and
keeping
my
bed
.
<EOS>
But
the
doctor
says
he
fears
the
first
cold
weather
.
<EOS>
I
know
what
that
means
,
my
dear
;
and
if
I
do
n't
see
you
now
,
before
your
marriage
,
I
shall
never
see
you
again
.
<EOS>
Pray
get
married
as
soon
as
you
can
.
<EOS>
I
want
to
know
that
you
are
Mrs.
Grey
before
I
go
.
<EOS>
If
I
were
to
hear
that
it
was
postponed
because
of
my
illness
,
I
think
it
would
kill
me
at
once
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
another
letter
for
her
from
Kate
,
full
,
of
course
,
of
congratulations
,
and
promising
to
be
at
the
wedding
;
"
that
is
,
"
said
Kate
,
"
unless
it
takes
place
at
the
house
of
some
one
of
your
very
grand
friends
;
"
and
telling
her
that
aunt
Greenow
was
to
be
married
in
a
fortnight
;
 
telling
her
of
this
,
and
begging
her
to
attend
that
wedding
.
<EOS>
"
You
should
stand
by
your
family
,
"
said
Kate
.
<EOS>
"
And
only
think
what
my
condition
will
be
if
I
have
no
one
here
to
support
me
.
<EOS>
Do
come
.
<EOS>
Journeys
are
nothing
nowadays
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
know
I
would
go
seven
times
the
distance
for
you
?
<EOS>
Mr.
Cheesacre
and
Captain
Bellfield
are
friends
after
all
,
and
Mr.
Cheesacre
is
to
be
best
man
.
<EOS>
Is
it
not
beautiful
?
<EOS>
As
for
poor
me
,
I
'm
told
I
have
n't
a
chance
left
of
becoming
mistress
of
Oileymead
and
all
its
wealth
.
"
  
<EOS>
Alice
began
to
think
that
her
hands
were
almost
too
full
.
<EOS>
If
she
herself
were
to
be
married
in
September
,
even
by
the
end
of
September
,
her
hands
were
very
full
indeed
.
<EOS>
Yet
she
did
not
know
how
to
refuse
any
of
the
requests
made
to
her
.
<EOS>
As
to
Lady
Macleod
,
her
visit
to
her
was
a
duty
which
must
of
course
be
performed
at
once
.
<EOS>
She
would
stay
but
one
day
in
London
,
and
then
go
down
to
Cheltenham
.
<EOS>
Having
resolved
upon
this
she
at
once
wrote
to
her
aunt
to
that
effect
.
<EOS>
As
to
that
other
affair
down
in
Westmoreland
,
she
sighed
as
she
thought
of
it
,
but
she
feared
that
she
must
go
there
also
.
<EOS>
Kate
had
suffered
too
much
on
her
behalf
to
allow
of
her
feeling
indifferent
to
such
a
request
.
  
<EOS>
Then
her
father
came
in
.
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
in
the
least
know
when
you
might
arrive
,
"
said
he
,
beginning
with
an
apology
for
his
absence
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
How
could
I
,
my
dear
?
"
<EOS>
Alice
scorned
to
remind
him
that
she
herself
had
named
the
precise
hour
of
the
train
by
which
they
had
arrived
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
all
right
,
papa
,
"
said
she
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
very
glad
to
have
an
hour
to
write
a
letter
or
two
.
<EOS>
Poor
Lady
Macleod
is
very
ill
.
<EOS>
I
must
go
to
her
the
day
after
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
,
dear
,
dear
!
<EOS>
I
had
heard
that
she
was
poorly
.
<EOS>
She
is
very
old
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
So
,
Alice
,
you
've
made
it
all
square
with
Mr.
Grey
at
last
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
papa
;
 
if
you
call
that
square
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
;
I
do
call
it
square
.
<EOS>
It
has
all
come
round
to
the
proper
thing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
he
thinks
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
think
yourself
,
my
dear
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
've
no
doubt
it
's
the
proper
thing
for
me
,
papa
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
not
;
of
course
not
;
and
I
can
tell
you
this
,
Alice
,
he
is
a
man
in
a
thousand
.
<EOS>
You
've
heard
about
the
money
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
money
,
papa
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
money
that
George
had
.
<EOS>
"
As
the
reader
is
aware
,
Alice
had
heard
nothing
special
about
this
money
.
<EOS>
She
only
knew
,
or
supposed
she
knew
,
that
she
had
given
three
thousand
pounds
to
her
cousin
.
<EOS>
But
now
her
father
explained
to
her
the
whole
transaction
.
<EOS>
"
We
could
n't
have
realized
your
money
for
months
,
perhaps
,
"
said
he
;
"
but
Grey
knew
that
some
men
must
have
rope
enough
before
they
can
hang
themselves
.
"
  
<EOS>
Alice
was
unable
to
say
anything
on
this
subject
to
her
father
,
but
to
herself
she
did
declare
that
not
in
that
way
or
with
that
hope
had
John
Grey
produced
his
money
.
"
<EOS>
He
must
be
paid
,
papa
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
Paid
!
"
<EOS>
he
answered
;
"
he
can
pay
himself
now
.
<EOS>
It
may
make
some
difference
in
the
settlements
,
perhaps
,
but
he
and
the
lawyers
may
arrange
that
.
<EOS>
I
sha
n't
think
of
interfering
with
such
a
man
as
Grey
.
<EOS>
If
you
could
only
know
,
my
dear
,
what
I
've
suffered
!
"
<EOS>
Alice
in
a
penitential
tone
expressed
her
sorrow
,
and
then
he
too
assured
her
that
he
had
forgiven
her
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Bless
you
,
my
child
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
"
and
make
you
happy
,
and
good
,
and
 
and
 
and
very
comfortable
.
"
<EOS>
After
that
he
went
back
to
his
club
.
  
<EOS>
Alice
made
her
journey
down
to
Cheltenham
without
any
adventure
,
and
was
received
by
Lady
Macleod
with
open
arms
.
"
<EOS>
Dearest
Alice
,
it
is
so
good
of
you
.
"
<EOS>
"
Good
!
"
said
Alice
,
"
would
I
not
have
gone
a
thousand
miles
to
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
Lady
Macleod
was
very
eager
to
know
all
about
the
coming
marriage
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
tell
you
now
,
<EOS>
my
dear
,
though
I
could
n't
do
it
before
,
that
I
knew
he
'd
persist
for
ever
.
<EOS>
He
told
me
so
himself
in
confidence
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
has
persisted
,
aunt
;
that
is
certain
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
hope
you
'll
reward
him
.
<EOS>
A
beautiful
woman
without
discretion
is
like
a
pearl
in
a
swine
's
snout
;
but
a
good
wife
is
a
crown
of
glory
to
her
husband
.
<EOS>
Remember
that
,
my
dear
,
and
choose
your
part
for
his
sake
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wo
n't
be
that
unfortunate
pearl
,
if
I
can
help
it
,
aunt
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
can
all
help
it
,
if
we
set
about
it
in
the
right
way
.
<EOS>
And
Alice
,
you
must
be
careful
to
find
out
all
his
likes
and
his
dislikes
.
<EOS>
Dear
me
!
<EOS>
I
remember
how
hard
I
found
it
,
but
then
I
do
n't
think
I
was
so
clever
as
you
are
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sometimes
I
think
nobody
has
ever
been
so
stupid
as
I
have
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
stupid
,
my
dear
;
if
I
must
say
the
word
,
it
is
self
-
willed
.
<EOS>
But
,
dear
,
all
that
is
forgiven
now
.
<EOS>
Is
it
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
a
forgiveness
which
it
is
rather
hard
to
get
,
"
said
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
something
said
then
as
to
the
necessity
of
looking
for
pardon
beyond
this
world
,
which
I
need
not
here
repeat
.
<EOS>
To
all
her
old
friend
's
little
sermons
Alice
was
infinitely
more
attentive
than
had
been
her
wo
nt
,
so
that
Lady
Macleod
was
comforted
and
took
heart
of
grace
,
and
at
last
brought
forth
from
under
her
pillow
a
letter
from
the
Countess
of
Midlothian
,
which
she
had
received
a
day
or
two
since
,
and
which
bore
upon
Alice
's
case
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
not
quite
sure
whether
I
'd
show
it
you
,
"
said
Lady
Macleod
,
"
because
you
would
n't
answer
her
when
she
wrote
to
you
.
<EOS>
But
when
I
'm
gone
,
as
I
shall
be
soon
,
she
will
be
the
nearest
relative
you
have
on
your
mother
's
side
,
and
from
her
great
position
,
you
know
,
Alice
 
<EOS>
"
But
here
Alice
became
impatient
for
the
letter
.
<EOS>
Her
aunt
handed
it
to
her
,
and
she
read
as
follows
:
    
Castle
Reekie
,
July
,
186
 
.
  
<EOS>
DEAR
LADY
MACLEOD
,
    
<EOS>
I
am
sorry
to
hear
of
the
symptoms
you
speak
about
.
<EOS>
I
strongly
advise
you
to
depend
chiefly
on
beef
-
tea
.
<EOS>
They
should
be
very
careful
to
send
it
up
quite
free
from
grease
,
and
it
should
not
be
too
strong
of
the
meat
.
<EOS>
There
should
be
no
vegetables
in
it
.
<EOS>
Not
soup
,
you
know
,
but
beef
-
tea
.
<EOS>
If
any
thing
acts
upon
your
strength
,
that
will
.
<EOS>
I
need
not
tell
one
who
has
lived
as
you
have
done
where
to
look
for
that
other
strength
which
alone
can
support
you
at
such
a
time
as
this
.
<EOS>
I
would
go
to
you
if
I
thought
that
my
presence
would
be
any
comfort
to
you
,
but
I
know
how
sensitive
you
are
,
and
the
shock
might
be
too
much
for
you
.
  
<EOS>
If
you
see
Alice
Vavasor
on
her
return
to
England
,
as
you
probably
will
,
pray
tell
her
from
me
that
I
give
her
my
warmest
congratulations
,
and
that
I
am
heartily
glad
that
matters
are
arranged
.
<EOS>
I
think
she
treated
my
attempts
to
heal
the
wound
in
a
manner
that
they
did
not
deserve
;
but
all
that
shall
be
forgiven
,
as
shall
also
her
original
bad
behaviour
to
poor
Mr.
Grey
.
  
<EOS>
Alice
was
becoming
weary
of
so
much
forgiveness
,
and
told
herself
,
as
she
was
reading
the
letter
,
that
that
of
Lady
Midlothian
was
at
any
rate
unnecessary
.
<EOS>
"
I
trust
that
we
may
yet
meet
and
be
friends
,
"
continued
Lady
Midlothian
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
extremely
gratified
at
finding
that
she
has
been
thought
so
much
of
by
Mr.
Palliser
.
<EOS>
I
'm
told
that
Mr.
Palliser
and
Mr.
Grey
have
become
great
friends
,
and
if
this
is
so
,
Alice
must
be
happy
to
feel
that
she
has
had
it
in
her
power
to
confer
so
great
a
benefit
on
her
future
husband
as
he
will
receive
from
this
introduction
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
ai
n't
a
bit
happy
,
and
I
have
conferred
no
benefit
on
Mr.
Grey
,
"
exclaimed
Alice
,
who
was
unable
to
repress
the
anger
occasioned
by
the
last
paragraph
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
it
is
a
great
benefit
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Mr.
Palliser
has
every
bit
as
much
cause
to
be
gratified
for
that
as
Mr.
Grey
,
and
perhaps
more
.
"
  
<EOS>
Poor
Lady
Macleod
could
not
argue
the
matter
in
her
present
state
.
<EOS>
She
merely
sighed
,
and
moved
her
shrivelled
old
hand
up
and
down
upon
the
counterpane
.
<EOS>
Alice
finished
the
letter
without
further
remarks
.
<EOS>
It
merely
went
on
to
say
how
happy
the
writer
would
be
to
know
something
of
her
cousin
as
Mrs.
Grey
,
as
also
to
know
something
of
Mr.
Grey
,
and
then
gave
a
general
invitation
to
both
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Grey
,
asking
them
to
come
to
Castle
Reekie
whenever
they
might
be
able
.
<EOS>
The
Marchioness
,
with
whom
Lady
Midlothian
was
staying
,
had
expressly
desired
her
to
give
this
message
.
<EOS>
Alice
,
however
,
could
not
but
observe
that
Lady
Midlothian
's
invitation
applied
only
to
another
person
's
house
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
sure
she
means
well
,
"
said
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
she
does
,
"
said
Lady
Macleod
,
"
and
<EOS>
then
you
know
you
'll
probably
have
children
;
and
think
what
a
thing
it
will
be
for
them
to
know
the
Midlothian
family
.
<EOS>
You
should
n't
rob
them
of
their
natural
advantages
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Alice
remained
a
week
with
her
aunt
,
and
went
from
thence
direct
to
Westmoreland
.
<EOS>
Some
order
as
to
bridal
preparations
<EOS>
we
must
presume
she
gave
on
that
single
day
which
she
passed
in
London
.
<EOS>
Much
advice
she
had
received
on
this
head
from
Lady
Glencora
,
and
no
inconsiderable
amount
of
assistance
was
to
be
rendered
to
her
at
Matching
during
the
fortnight
she
would
remain
there
before
her
marriage
.
<EOS>
Something
also
,
let
us
hope
,
she
might
do
at
Cheltenham
.
<EOS>
Something
<EOS>
no
doubt
she
did
do
.
<EOS>
Something
also
might
probably
be
achieved
among
the
wilds
in
Westmoreland
,
but
that
something
would
necessarily
be
of
a
nature
not
requiring
fashionable
tradespeople
.
<EOS>
While
at
Cheltenham
,
she
determined
that
she
would
not
again
return
to
London
before
her
marriage
.
<EOS>
This
resolve
was
caused
by
a
very
urgent
letter
from
Mr.
Grey
,
and
by
another
,
almost
equally
urgent
,
from
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
If
the
marriage
did
not
take
place
in
September
she
would
not
be
present
at
it
.
<EOS>
The
gods
of
the
world
,
 
of
Lady
Glencora
's
world
,
 
had
met
together
and
come
to
a
great
decision
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
was
to
be
removed
in
October
to
Gatherum
Castle
,
and
remain
there
till
the
following
spring
,
so
that
the
heir
might
,
in
truth
,
be
born
in
the
purple
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
such
a
bore

"
said
Lady
Glencora
,
"
and
<EOS>
I
know
it
will
be
a
girl
.
<EOS>
But
the
Duke
is
n't
to
be
there
,
except
for
the
Christmas
week

"
<EOS>
An
invitation
for
the
ceremony
at
Matching
had
been
sent
from
Mr.
Palliser
to
Mr.
Vavasor
,
and
another
from
Lady
Glencora
to
Kate
,
"
whom
I
long
to
know
,
"
said
her
ladyship
,
"
and
with
whom
I
should
like
to
pick
a
crow
,
if
I
dared
,
as
I
'm
sure
she
did
all
the
mischief
.

<EOS>
Mr.
Cheesacre
's
Fate
.
 
<EOS>
It
must
be
acknowledged
that
Mrs.
Greenow
was
a
woman
of
great
resources
,
and
that
she
would
be
very
prudent
for
others
,
though
I
fear
the
verdict
of
those
who
know
her
must
go
against
her
in
regard
to
prudence
in
herself
.
<EOS>
Her
marriage
with
Captain
Bellfield
was
a
rash
act
,
 
certainly
a
rash
act
,
although
she
did
take
so
much
care
in
securing
the
payment
of
her
own
income
into
her
own
hands
;
but
the
manner
in
which
she
made
him
live
discreetly
for
some
months
previous
to
his
marriage
,
the
tact
with
which
she
renewed
the
friendship
which
had
existed
between
him
and
Mr.
Cheesacre
,
and
the
skill
she
used
in
at
last
providing
Mr.
Cheesacre
with
a
wife
,
oblige
us
all
to
admit
that
,
as
a
general
,
she
had
great
powers
.
  
<EOS>
When
Alice
reached
Vavasor
Hall
she
found
Charlie
Fairstairs
established
there
on
a
long
visit
.
<EOS>
Charlie
and
Kate
were
to
be
the
two
bridesmaids
,
and
,
as
Kate
told
her
cousin
in
their
first
confidential
intercourse
on
the
evening
of
Alice
's
arrival
,
there
were
already
great
hopes
in
the
household
that
the
master
of
Oileymead
might
be
brought
to
surrender
.
<EOS>
It
was
true
that
Charlie
had
not
a
shilling
,
and
that
Mr.
Cheesacre
had
set
his
heart
on
marrying
an
heiress
.
<EOS>
It
was
true
that
Miss
Fairstairs
had
always
stood
low
in
the
gentleman
's
estimation
,
as
being
connected
with
people
who
were
as
much
without
rank
and
fashion
as
they
were
without
money
,
and
that
the
gentleman
loved
rank
and
fashion
dearly
.
<EOS>
It
was
true
that
Charlie
was
no
beauty
,
and
that
Cheesacre
had
an
eye
for
feminine
charms
.
<EOS>
It
was
true
that
he
had
despised
Charlie
,
and
had
spoken
his
contempt
openly
;
 
that
he
had
seen
the
girl
on
the
sands
at
Yarmouth
every
summer
for
the
last
ten
years
,
and
about
the
streets
of
Norwich
every
winter
,
and
had
learned
to
regard
her
as
a
thing
poor
and
despicable
,
because
she
was
common
in
his
eyes
.
<EOS>
It
is
thus
that
the
Cheesacres
judge
of
people
.
<EOS>
But
in
spite
of
all
these
difficulties
Mrs.
Greenow
had
taken
up
poor
Charlie
's
case
,
and
Kate
Vavasor
expressed
a
strong
opinion
that
her
aunt
would
win
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
has
she
done
to
the
man
?
"
<EOS>
Alice
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
Coaxed
him
;
simply
that
.
<EOS>
She
has
made
herself
so
much
his
master
that
he
does
n't
know
how
to
say
no
to
her
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
I
have
thought
that
he
might
possibly
run
away
,
but
I
have
abandoned
that
fear
now
.
<EOS>
She
has
little
confidences
with
him
from
day
to
day
,
which
are
so
alluring
to
him
that
he
can
not
tear
himself
off
.
<EOS>
In
the
middle
of
one
of
them
he
will
find
himself
engaged
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
the
unfortunate
girl
!
<EOS>
Wo
n't
it
be
a
wretched
marriage
for
her
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
at
all
.
<EOS>
She
'll
make
him
a
very
good
wife
.
<EOS>
He
's
one
of
those
men
to
whom
any
woman
,
after
a
little
time
,
will
come
to
be
the
same
.
<EOS>
He
'll
be
rough
with
her
once
a
month
or
so
,
and
perhaps
tell
her
that
she
brought
no
money
with
her
;
but
that
wo
n't
break
any
bones
,
and
Charlie
will
know
how
to
fight
her
own
battles
.
<EOS>
She
'll
save
his
money
if
she
brings
none
,
and
in
a
few
years
"
time
they
will
quite
understand
each
other
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Cheesacre
and
Captain
Bellfield
were
at
this
time
living
in
lodgings
together
,
at
Penrith
,
but
came
over
and
spent
every
other
day
at
Vavasor
,
returning
always
to
their
lodgings
in
the
evening
.
<EOS>
It
wanted
but
<EOS>
eight
days
to
the
marriage
when
Alice
arrived
,
and
preparations
for
that
event
were
in
progress
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
to
be
very
quiet
,
Alice
,
"
said
her
aunt
;
"
as
quiet
as
such
a
thing
can
be
made
.
<EOS>
I
owe
that
to
the
memory
of
the
departed
one
.
<EOS>
I
know
that
he
is
looking
down
upon
me
,
and
that
he
approves
all
that
I
do
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
he
told
me
once
that
he
did
not
want
me
to
live
desolate
for
his
sake
.
<EOS>
If
I
did
n't
feel
that
he
was
looking
down
and
approving
it
,
I
should
be
wretched
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
took
Alice
up
to
see
her
trousseau
,
and
gave
the
other
expectant
bride
some
little
hints
which
,
under
present
circumstances
,
might
be
useful
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
indeed
;
only
three
-
and
-
sixpence
a
piece
,
and
they
're
quite
real
.
<EOS>
Feel
them
.
<EOS>
You
would
n't
get
them
in
the
shops
under
six
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Alice
did
feel
them
,
and
wondered
whether
her
aunt
could
have
saved
the
half
-
crown
honestly
.
<EOS>
"
I
had
my
eyes
about
me
when
I
was
up
in
town
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
And
look
here
,
these
are
quite
new
,
 
have
never
been
on
yet
,
and
I
had
them
when
I
was
married
before
.
<EOS>
There
is
nothing
like
being
careful
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
I
hate
meanness
,
as
everybody
knows
who
knows
me
;
but
there
is
nothing
like
being
careful
.
<EOS>
You
have
a
lot
of
rich
people
about
you
just
now
,
and
will
have
ever
so
many
things
given
you
which
you
wo
n't
want
.
<EOS>
Do
you
put
them
all
by
,
and
be
careful
.
<EOS>
They
may
turn
out
useful
,
you
know
.
"
<EOS>
Saying
this
,
Mrs.
Greenow
folded
up
,
among
her
present
bridal
belongings
,
sundries
of
the
wealth
which
had
accrued
to
her
in
an
earlier
stage
of
her
career
.
  
<EOS>
And
then
Mrs.
Greenow
opened
her
mind
to
Alice
about
the
Captain
.
<EOS>
"
He
's
as
good
as
gold
,
my
dear
;
he
is
,
indeed
,
 
in
his
own
way
.
<EOS>
Of
course
,
I
know
that
he
has
faults
,
and
I
should
like
to
know
who
has
n't
.
<EOS>
Although
poor
dear
Greenow
certainly
was
more
without
them
than
anybody
else
I
ever
knew
.
<EOS>
"
As
this
remembrance
came
upon
Mrs.
Greenow
she
put
her
handkerchief
to
her
eyes
,
and
Alice
observed
that
that
which
she
held
still
bore
the
deepest
hem
of
widowhood
.
<EOS>
They
would
be
used
,
no
doubt
,
till
the
last
day
,
and
then
put
by
in
lavender
for
future
possible
occasions
.
<EOS>
"
Bellfield
may
have
been
a
little
extravagant
.
<EOS>
I
dare
say
he
has
.
<EOS>
But
how
can
a
man
help
being
extravagant
when
he
has
n't
got
any
regular
income
?
<EOS>
He
has
been
ill
-
treated
in
his
profession
;
very
.
<EOS>
It
makes
my
blood
curdle
when
I
think
of
it
.
<EOS>
After
fighting
his
country
's
battles
through
blood
,
and
dust
,
and
wounds
;
 
but
I
'll
tell
you
about
that
another
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
a
man
seldom
does
make
a
fortune
,
aunt
,
by
being
a
soldier
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Never
,
my
dear
;
much
better
be
a
tailor
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
ever
marry
a
soldier
.
<EOS>
But
as
I
was
saying
,
he
is
the
best
-
tempered
creature
alive
,
and
the
staunchest
friend
I
ever
met
.
<EOS>
You
should
hear
what
Mr.
Cheesacre
says
of
him
!
<EOS>
But
you
do
n't
know
Mr.
Cheesacre
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
No
,
aunt
,
not
yet
.
<EOS>
If
you
remember
,
he
went
away
before
I
saw
him
when
he
came
here
before
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
know
,
poor
fellow
!
<EOS>
Between
you
and
me
,
Kate
might
have
had
him
if
she
liked
;
but
perhaps
Kate
was
right
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
he
would
have
suited
Kate
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Because
of
the
farmyard
,
you
mean
?
<EOS>
Kate
should
n't
give
herself
airs
.
<EOS>
Money
's
never
dirty
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
But
perhaps
it
's
all
for
the
best
.
<EOS>
There
's
a
sweet
girl
here
to
whom
he
is
violently
attached
,
and
who
I
hope
will
become
Mrs.
Cheesacre
.
<EOS>
But
as
I
was
saying
,
the
friendship
between
these
two
men
is
quite
wonderful
,
and
I
have
always
observed
that
when
a
man
can
create
that
kind
of
affection
in
the
bosom
of
another
man
,
he
invariably
is
,
 
the
sort
of
man
,
 
the
man
<EOS>
,
in
fact
,
who
makes
a
good
husband
.
"
  
<EOS>
Alice
knew
the
story
of
Charlie
Fairstairs
and
her
hopes
;
knew
of
the
quarrels
between
Bellfield
and
Cheesacre
;
knew
almost
as
much
of
Bellfield
's
past
life
as
Mrs.
Greenow
did
herself
;
and
Mrs.
Greenow
was
no
doubt
aware
that
such
was
the
case
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
she
had
a
pleasure
in
telling
her
own
story
,
and
told
it
as
though
she
believed
every
word
that
she
spoke
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
following
day
the
two
gentlemen
came
over
,
according
to
custom
,
and
Alice
observed
that
Miss
Fairstairs
hardly
spoke
to
Mr.
Cheesacre
.
<EOS>
Indeed
her
manner
of
avoiding
that
gentleman
was
so
very
marked
,
that
it
was
impossible
not
to
observe
it
.
<EOS>
They
drank
tea
out
of
doors
,
and
when
Mr.
Cheesacre
on
one
occasion
sauntered
across
towards
the
end
of
the
bench
on
which
Charlie
was
sitting
,
Charlie
got
up
and
walked
away
.
<EOS>
And
in
strolling
about
the
place
afterwards
,
and
in
going
up
through
the
wood
,
she
was
at
great
pains
to
attach
herself
to
some
other
person
,
so
that
there
should
be
no
such
attaching
between
her
and
the
owner
of
Oileymead
.
<EOS>
At
one
time
Mr.
Cheesacre
did
get
close
up
to
her
and
spoke
some
word
,
some
very
indifferent
word
.
<EOS>
He
knew
that
he
was
being
cut
and
he
wanted
to
avoid
the
appearance
of
a
scene
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
,
sir
,
"
said
Charlie
,
again
moving
away
with
excellent
dignity
,
and
she
at
once
attached
herself
to
Alice
who
was
close
by
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
you
have
just
come
home
from
Switzerland
,
"
said
Charlie
.
"
<EOS>
Beautiful
Switzerland
!
<EOS>
My
heart
pants
for
Switzerland
.
<EOS>
Do
tell
me
something
about
Switzerland
!
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Cheesacre
had
heard
that
Alice
was
the
dear
friend
of
a
lady
who
would
probably
some
day
become
a
duchess
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
naturally
held
her
in
awe
,
and
slunk
away
.
<EOS>
On
this
occasion
Mrs.
Greenow
clung
lovingly
to
her
future
husband
,
and
the
effect
was
that
Mr.
Cheesacre
found
himself
to
be
very
much
alone
and
unhappy
.
<EOS>
He
had
generally
enjoyed
these
days
at
Vavasor
Hall
,
having
found
himself
,
or
fancied
himself
,
to
be
the
dominant
spirit
there
.
<EOS>
That
Mrs.
Greenow
was
always
in
truth
the
dominant
spirit
I
need
hardly
say
;
but
she
knew
how
to
make
a
companion
happy
,
and
well
also
how
to
make
him
wretched
.
<EOS>
On
the
whole
of
this
day
poor
Cheesacre
was
very
wretched
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
I
shall
go
there
any
more
,
"
he
said
to
Bellfield
,
as
he
drove
the
gig
back
to
Penrith
that
evening
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
go
there
any
more
,
Cheesy
,
"
said
Bellfield
;
"
why
,
we
are
to
have
the
dinner
out
in
the
field
on
Friday
.
<EOS>
It
's
your
own
bespeak
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
yes
;
I
'll
go
on
Friday
,
but
not
after
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
'll
stop
and
see
me
turned
off
,
old
fellow
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
use
?
<EOS>
You
'll
get
your
wife
,
and
that
's
enough
for
you
.
<EOS>
The
truth
is
,
that
since
that
girl
came
down
from
London
with
her
d
 
<EOS>
---
d
airs
;
"
 
the
girl
from
London
with
the
airs
was
poor
Alice
,
 
"
the
place
is
quite
changed
.
<EOS>
I
'm
blessed
if
the
whole
thing
is
n't
as
dark
as
ditch
-
water
.
<EOS>
I
'm
a
plain
man
,
I
am
;
and
I
do
hate
your
swells
.
<EOS>
"
Against
this
view
of
the
case
Captain
Bellfield
argued
stoutly
;
but
Cheesacre
had
been
offended
,
and
throughout
the
next
day
he
was
cross
and
touchy
.
<EOS>
He
would
n't
play
billiards
,
and
on
one
occasion
hinted
that
he
hoped
he
should
get
that
money
soon
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
did
it
admirably
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Mrs.
Greenow
that
night
to
Charlie
Fairstairs
.
<EOS>
The
widow
was
now
on
terms
almost
more
confidential
with
Miss
Fairstairs
than
with
her
own
niece
,
Kate
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
She
loved
a
little
bit
of
intrigue
;
and
though
Kate
could
intrigue
,
as
we
have
seen
in
this
story
,
Kate
would
not
join
her
aunt
's
intrigues
.
<EOS>
"
You
did
it
admirably
.
<EOS>
I
really
did
not
think
you
had
so
much
in
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
do
n't
know
,
"
said
Charlie
,
blushing
at
the
praise
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
it
's
the
only
way
,
my
dear
;
 
the
only
way
,
I
mean
,
for
you
with
such
a
one
as
him
.
<EOS>
And
if
he
does
come
round
,
you
'll
find
him
an
excellent
husband
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
he
cares
for
me
a
bit
,
"
said
Charlie
whimpering
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pooh
,
nonsense
!
<EOS>
Girls
never
know
whether
men
care
for
them
or
not
.
<EOS>
If
he
asks
you
to
marry
him
,
wo
n't
that
be
a
sign
that
he
cares
for
you
?
<EOS>
and
if
he
do
n't
,
why
,
there
'll
be
no
harm
done
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
he
thinks
it
's
his
money
 
"
began
Charlie
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
do
n't
talk
nonsense
,
Charlie
,
"
said
Mrs.
Greenow
,
"
or
you
'll
make
me
sick
.
<EOS>
Of
course
it
's
his
money
,
more
or
less
.
<EOS>
You
do
n't
mean
to
tell
me
you
'd
go
and
fall
in
love
with
him
if
he
was
like
Bellfield
,
and
had
n't
got
a
rap
?
<EOS>
I
can
afford
that
sort
of
thing
;
you
ca
n't
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
mean
to
say
you
ai
n't
to
love
him
.
<EOS>
Of
course
,
you
're
to
love
him
;
and
I
've
no
doubt
you
will
,
and
make
him
a
very
good
wife
.
<EOS>
I
always
think
that
worldliness
and
sentimentality
are
like
brandy
-
and
-
water
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
like
either
of
them
separately
,
but
taken
together
<EOS>
they
make
a
very
nice
drink
.
<EOS>
I
like
them
warm
,
with
 
---
as
the
gentlemen
say
.
<EOS>
"
To
this
little
lecture
Miss
Fairstairs
listened
with
dutiful
patience
,
and
when
it
was
over
she
said
nothing
more
of
her
outraged
affections
or
of
her
disregard
for
money
.
"
<EOS>
And
now
,
my
dear
,
mind
you
look
your
best
on
Friday
.
<EOS>
I
'll
get
him
away
immediately
after
dinner
,
and
when
he
's
done
with
me
you
can
contrive
to
be
in
his
way
,
you
know
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
next
day
was
what
Kate
called
the
blank
day
at
the
Hall
.
<EOS>
The
ladies
were
all
alone
,
and
devoted
themselves
,
as
was
always
the
case
on
the
blank
days
,
to
millinery
and
household
cares
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Greenow
,
as
has
before
been
stated
,
had
taken
a
lease
of
the
place
,
and
her
troubles
extended
beyond
her
mere
bridal
wardrobe
.
<EOS>
Large
trunks
of
household
linen
had
arrived
,
and
all
this
linen
was
marked
with
the
name
of
Greenow
;
Greenow
,
5.58
;
Greenow
,
7.52
;
and
a
good
deal
had
to
be
done
before
this
ancient
wealth
of
housewifery
could
probably
be
converted
to
Bellfield
purposes
.
<EOS>
"
We
must
cut
out
the
pieces
,
Jeannette
,
and
work
"
em
in
again
ever
so
carefully
,
"
said
the
widow
,
after
some
painful
consideration
.
<EOS>
"
It
will
always
show
,
"
said
Jeannette
,
shaking
her
head
.
<EOS>
"
But
the
other
would
show
worse
,
"
said
the
widow
;
"
and
if
you
finedraw
it
,
not
one
person
in
ten
will
notice
it
.
<EOS>
We
'd
always
put
them
on
with
the
name
to
the
feet
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
not
quite
true
that
Cheesacre
had
bespoke
the
dinner
out
in
the
field
,
although
no
doubt
he
thought
he
had
done
so
.
<EOS>
The
little
treat
,
if
treat
<EOS>
it
was
,
had
all
been
arranged
by
Mrs.
Greenow
,
who
was
ever
ready
to
create
festivities
.
<EOS>
There
was
not
much
scope
for
a
picnic
here
.
<EOS>
Besides
their
own
party
,
which
,
of
course
,
included
the
Captain
and
Mr.
Cheesacre
,
no
guest
could
be
caught
except
the
clergyman
;
 
that
low
-
church
clergyman
,
who
was
so
anxious
about
his
income
,
and
with
whom
the
old
Squire
had
quarrelled
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Greenow
had
quickly
obtained
the
advantage
of
his
alliance
,
and
he
,
who
was
soon
to
perform
on
her
behalf
the
marriage
ceremony
,
had
promised
to
grace
this
little
festival
.
<EOS>
The
affair
simply
amounted
to
this
,
that
they
were
to
eat
their
dinner
uncomfortably
in
the
field
instead
of
comfortably
in
the
dining
-
room
.
<EOS>
But
Mrs.
Greenow
knew
that
Charlie
's
charms
would
be
much
strengthened
by
a
dinner
out
-
of
-
doors
.
<EOS>
"
Nothing
,
"
she
said
to
Kate
,
"
nothing
makes
a
man
come
forward
so
well
as
putting
him
altogether
out
of
his
usual
tack
.
<EOS>
A
man
who
would
n't
think
of
such
a
thing
in
the
drawing
-
room
would
be
sure
to
make
an
offer
if
he
spent
an
evening
with
a
young
lady
down
-
stairs
in
the
kitchen
.
"
  
<EOS>
At
two
o'clock
the
gig
from
Penrith
arrived
at
the
Hall
,
and
for
the
next
hour
both
Cheesacre
and
the
Captain
were
engaged
in
preparing
the
tables
and
carrying
out
the
viands
.
<EOS>
The
Captain
and
Charlie
Fairstairs
were
going
to
lay
the
cloth
.
<EOS>
"
Let
me
do
it
,
"
said
Cheesacre
taking
it
out
of
the
Captain
's
hands
.
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
certainly
,
"
said
the
Captain
,
giving
up
his
prize
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Captain
Bellfield
would
do
it
much
better
,
"
said
Charlie
,
with
a
little
toss
of
her
head
;
"
he
's
as
good
as
a
married
man
,
and
they
always
do
these
things
best
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
day
was
fine
,
and
although
the
shade
was
not
perfect
,
and
the
midges
were
troublesome
,
the
dinner
went
off
very
nicely
.
<EOS>
It
was
beautiful
to
see
how
well
Mrs.
Greenow
remembered
herself
about
the
grace
,
seeing
that
the
clergyman
was
there
.
<EOS>
She
was
just
in
time
,
and
would
have
been
very
angry
with
herself
,
and
have
thought
herself
awkward
,
had
she
forgotten
it
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Cheesacre
sat
on
her
right
hand
,
and
the
clergyman
on
her
left
,
and
she
hardly
spoke
a
word
to
Bellfield
.
<EOS>
Her
sweetest
smiles
were
all
given
to
Cheesacre
.
<EOS>
She
was
specially
anxious
to
keep
her
neighbour
,
the
parson
,
in
good
-
humour
,
and
therefore
illuminated
him
once
in
every
five
minutes
with
a
passing
ray
,
but
the
full
splendour
of
her
light
was
poured
out
upon
Cheesacre
,
as
it
never
had
before
been
poured
.
<EOS>
How
she
did
flatter
him
,
and
with
what
a
capacious
gullet
did
he
swallow
her
flatteries
!
<EOS>
Oileymead
was
the
only
paradise
she
had
ever
seen
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
,
me
;
when
I
think
of
it
sometimes
,
 
but
never
mind
.
<EOS>
"
A
moment
came
to
him
when
he
thought
that
even
yet
he
might
win
the
race
,
and
send
Bellfield
away
howling
into
outer
darkness
.
<EOS>
A
moment
came
to
him
,
and
the
widow
saw
the
moment
well
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
I
have
done
for
the
best
,
"
said
she
,
"
and
therefore
I
shall
never
regret
it
;
at
any
rate
,
it
's
done
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Not
done
yet
,
"
said
he
plaintively
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
done
,
and
done
,
and
done
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
a
man
in
your
position
in
the
county
should
always
marry
a
wife
younger
than
yourself
,
 
a
good
deal
younger
.
<EOS>
"
Cheesacre
did
not
understand
the
argument
,
but
he
liked
the
allusion
to
his
position
in
the
county
,
and
he
perceived
that
it
was
too
late
for
any
changes
in
the
present
arrangements
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
happy
;
and
all
that
feeling
of
animosity
to
Alice
had
vanished
from
his
breast
.
<EOS>
Poor
Alice
!
<EOS>
she
,
at
any
rate
,
was
innocent
.
<EOS>
With
so
much
of
her
own
to
fill
her
mind
,
she
had
been
but
little
able
to
take
her
share
in
the
Greenow
festivities
;
and
we
may
safely
say
,
that
if
Mr.
Cheesacre
's
supremacy
was
on
any
occasion
attacked
,
it
was
not
attacked
by
her
.
<EOS>
His
supremacy
on
this
occasion
was
paramount
,
and
during
the
dinner
,
and
after
the
dinner
,
he
was
allowed
to
give
his
orders
to
Bellfield
in
a
manner
that
must
have
gratified
him
much
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
have
another
glass
of
champagne
with
me
,
my
friend
,
"
said
Mrs.
Greenow
;
and
Mr.
Cheesacre
drank
the
other
glass
of
champagne
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
the
second
nor
the
third
that
he
had
taken
.
  
<EOS>
After
dinner
they
started
off
for
a
ramble
through
the
fields
,
and
Mrs.
Greenow
and
Mr.
Cheesacre
were
together
.
<EOS>
I
think
that
Charlie
Fairstairs
did
not
go
with
them
at
all
.
<EOS>
I
think
she
went
into
the
house
and
washed
her
face
,
and
brushed
her
hair
,
and
settled
her
muslin
.
<EOS>
I
should
not
wonder
if
she
took
off
her
frock
and
ironed
it
again
.
<EOS>
Captain
Bellfield
,
I
know
,
went
with
Alice
,
and
created
some
astonishment
by
assuring
her
that
he
fully
meant
to
correct
the
error
of
his
ways
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
what
it
is
,
"
he
said
,
"
to
be
connected
with
such
a
family
as
yours
,
Miss
Vavasor
.
"
<EOS>
He
too
had
heard
about
the
future
duchess
,
and
wished
to
be
on
his
best
behaviour
.
<EOS>
Kate
fell
to
the
lot
of
the
parson
.
  
<EOS>
"
This
is
the
last
time
we
shall
ever
be
together
in
this
way
,
"
said
the
widow
to
her
friend
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
no
,
"
said
Cheesacre
;
"
I
hope
not
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
last
time
.
<EOS>
On
Wednesday
I
become
Mrs.
Bellfield
,
and
I
need
hardly
say
that
I
have
many
things
to
think
of
before
that
;
but
Mr.
Cheesacre
,
I
hope
we
are
not
to
be
strangers
hereafter
?
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Cheesacre
said
that
he
hoped
not
.
<EOS>
Oileymead
would
always
be
open
to
Captain
and
Mrs.
Bellfield
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
all
know
your
hospitality
,
"
said
she
;
<EOS>
"
it
is
not
to
-
day
nor
to
-
morrow
that
I
or
my
husband
,
 
that
is
to
be
,
 
will
have
to
learn
that
.
<EOS>
He
always
declares
that
you
are
the
very
beau
ideal
of
an
English
country
gentleman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Merely
a
poor
Norfolk
farmer
,
"
said
Cheesacre
.
<EOS>
"
I
never
want
to
put
myself
beyond
my
own
place
.
<EOS>
There
has
been
some
talk
about
the
Commission
of
the
Peace
,
but
I
do
n't
think
anything
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
has
been
the
greatest
blessing
in
the
world
for
him
that
he
has
ever
known
you
,
"
said
Mrs.
Greenow
,
still
talking
about
her
future
husband
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
've
tried
to
be
good
-
natured
;
that
's
all
.
<EOS>
D
 
---
me
<EOS>
,
Mrs.
Greenow
,
what
's
the
use
of
living
if
one
does
n't
try
to
be
good
-
natured
?
<EOS>
There
is
n't
a
better
fellow
than
Bellfield
living
.
<EOS>
He
and
I
ran
for
the
same
plate
,
and
he
has
won
it
.
<EOS>
He
's
a
lucky
fellow
,
and
I
do
n't
begrudge
him
his
luck
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
so
manly
of
you
,
Mr.
Cheesacre
!
<EOS>
But
,
indeed
,
the
plate
you
speak
of
was
not
worth
your
running
for
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
may
have
my
own
opinion
about
that
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
not
.
<EOS>
Nobody
knows
that
as
well
as
I
do
,
or
could
have
thought
over
the
whole
matter
so
often
.
<EOS>
I
know
very
well
what
my
mission
is
in
life
.
<EOS>
The
mistress
of
your
house
,
Mr.
Cheesacre
,
should
not
be
any
man
's
widow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
would
n't
be
a
widow
then
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
A
virgin
heart
should
be
yours
;
and
a
virgin
heart
may
be
yours
,
if
you
choose
to
accept
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
bother
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
choose
to
take
my
solicitude
on
your
behalf
in
that
way
,
of
course
I
have
done
.
<EOS>
You
were
good
enough
to
say
just
now
that
you
wished
to
see
me
and
my
husband
in
your
hospitable
halls
.
<EOS>
After
all
that
has
passed
,
do
you
think
that
I
could
be
a
visitor
at
your
house
unless
there
is
a
mistress
there
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
word
,
I
think
you
might
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
Mr.
Cheesacre
;
certainly
not
.
<EOS>
For
all
our
sakes
,
I
should
decline
.
<EOS>
But
if
you
were
married
 
"
  
"
You
are
always
wanting
to
marry
me
,
Mrs.
Greenow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
,
I
do
.
<EOS>
It
is
the
only
way
in
which
there
can
be
any
friendship
between
us
,
and
not
for
worlds
would
I
lose
that
advantage
for
my
husband
,
 
let
alone
what
I
may
feel
for
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
did
n't
you
take
me
yourself
,
Mrs.
Greenow
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
ca
n't
understand
,
it
is
not
for
me
to
say
anything
more
,
Mr.
Cheesacre

<EOS>
If
you
value
the
warm
affection
of
a
virgin
heart

"
Why
,
Mrs.
Greenow
,
all
yesterday
she
would
n't
say
a
word
to
me

"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
say
a
word

you

that
all
you

Are
you
so
ignorant

you
can
not
see
when
a
girl
's
heart
is
breaking
beneath
her
stays

"
This
almost
improper
allusion
had
quite
an
effect
on
Mr.
Cheesacre
's
sensitive
bosom
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Did
you
say
a
word
to
her
yesterday
?
<EOS>
And
if
not

why
have
you
said
so
many
words
before

Oh

Mrs.
Greenow

come

It
is
,
oh

Mrs.
Greenow

<EOS>
But
it
is
time
that
we
should
go
back
to
them
.
<EOS>
"
They
had
been
sitting
all
this
time
on
a
bank
,
under
a
hedge
.
<EOS>
"
We
will
have
our
tea
,
and
you
shall
have
your
pipe
and
brandy

water
,
and
Charlie
shall
bring
it
to
you
.
<EOS>
Shall
she
,
Mr.
Cheesacre
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
If
she
likes
she
shall
,
of
course
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
ask
her
,
and
she
'll
like
it
it
quick
enough
.
<EOS>
But
remember
,
Mr.
Cheesacre
,
I
'm
quite
serious
in
what
I
say
about
your
having
a
mistress
for
your
house
.
<EOS>
Only
think
what
an
age
you
'll
be
when
your
children
grow
up
,
if
you
do
n't
marry
soon
now
.
"
  
<EOS>
They
returned
to
the
field
in
which
they
had
dined
,
and
found
Charlie
under
the
trees
,
with
her
muslin
looking
very
fresh
.
<EOS>
"
What
,
all
a
-
mort
?
"
said
Mrs.
Greenow
.
<EOS>
Charlie
did
not
quite
understand
this
,
but
replied
that
she
preferred
being
alone
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
told
him
that
you
should
fill
his
pipe
for
him
,
"
said
Mrs.
Greenow
.
<EOS>
"
He
does
n't
care
for
ladies
to
fill
his
pipe
for
him
,
"
said
Charlie
.
<EOS>
"
Do
you
try
,
"
said
the
widow
,
"
while
I
go
indoors
and
order
the
tea
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
had
been
necessary
to
put
the
bait
very
close
before
Cheesacre
's
eyes
,
or
there
would
have
been
no
hope
that
he
might
take
it
.
<EOS>
The
bait
had
been
put
so
very
close
that
we
must
feel
sure
that
he
saw
the
hook
.
<EOS>
But
there
are
fish
so
silly
that
they
will
take
the
bait
although
they
know
the
hook
is
there
.
<EOS>
Cheesacre
understood
it
all
.
<EOS>
Many
things
he
could
not
see
,
but
he
could
see
that
Mrs.
Greenow
was
trying
to
catch
him
as
a
husband
for
Charlie
Fairstairs
;
and
he
knew
also
that
he
had
always
despised
Charlie
,
and
that
no
worldly
advantage
whatever
would
accrue
to
him
by
a
marriage
with
such
a
girl
.
<EOS>
But
there
she
was
,
and
he
did
n't
quite
know
how
to
avoid
it
.
<EOS>
She
did
look
rather
nice
in
her
clear
-
starched
muslin
frock
,
and
he
felt
that
he
should
like
to
kiss
her
.
<EOS>
He
need
n't
marry
her
because
he
kissed
her
.
<EOS>
The
champagne
which
had
created
the
desire
also
gave
him
the
audacity
.
<EOS>
He
gave
one
glance
around
him
to
see
that
he
was
not
observed
,
and
then
he
did
kiss
Charlie
Fairstairs
under
the
trees
.
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Mr.
Cheesacre
,
"
said
Charlie
.
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Mr.
Cheesacre
,
"
echoed
a
laughing
voice
;
and
poor
Cheesacre
,
looking
round
,
saw
that
Mrs.
Greenow
,
who
ought
to
have
been
inside
the
house
looking
after
the
boiling
water
,
was
moving
about
for
some
unknown
reason
within
sight
of
the
spot
which
he
had
chosen
for
his
dalliance
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Cheesacre
,
"
said
Charlie
sobbing
,
"
how
dare
you
do
that
?
 
<EOS>
and
where
all
the
world
could
see
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
only
Mrs.
Greenow
,
"
said
Cheesacre
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
will
she
think
of
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Lord
bless
you
 
she
wo
n't
think
anything
about
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
do
;
 
I
think
a
great
deal
about
it
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
what
to
do
,
I
do
n't
;
 
I
do
n't
.
"
<EOS>
Whereupon
Charlie
got
up
from
her
seat
under
the
trees
and
began
to
move
away
slowly
.
<EOS>
Cheesacre
thought
about
it
for
a
moment
or
two
.
<EOS>
Should
he
follow
her
or
should
he
not
?
<EOS>
He
knew
that
he
had
better
not
follow
her
.
<EOS>
He
knew
that
she
was
bait
with
a
very
visible
hook
.
<EOS>
He
knew
that
he
was
a
big
fish
for
whom
these
two
women
were
angling
.
<EOS>
But
after
all
,
perhaps
it
would
n't
do
him
much
harm
to
be
caught
.
<EOS>
So
he
got
up
and
followed
her
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
suppose
she
meant
to
take
the
way
towards
the
woods
,
 
towards
the
little
path
leading
to
the
old
summer
-
house
up
in
the
trees
.
<EOS>
She
was
too
much
beside
herself
to
know
where
she
was
going
,
no
doubt
.
<EOS>
But
that
was
the
path
she
did
take
,
and
before
long
she
and
Cheesacre
were
in
the
summerhouse
together
.
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
,
Sam
,
do
n't
!
<EOS>
Somebody
really
will
be
coming
.
<EOS>
Well
,
then
,
there
.
<EOS>
Now
I
wo
n't
do
it
again
.
"
<EOS>
"
Twas
thus
she
spoke
when
the
last
kiss
was
given
on
this
occasion
;
 
unless
there
may
have
been
one
or
two
later
in
the
evening
,
to
which
it
is
not
necessary
more
especially
to
allude
here
.
<EOS>
But
on
the
occasion
of
that
last
kiss
in
the
summer
-
house
Miss
Fairstairs
was
perfectly
justified
by
circumstances
,
for
she
was
then
the
promised
bride
of
Mr.
Cheesacre
.
  
<EOS>
But
how
was
he
to
get
down
again
among
his
friends
?
<EOS>
That
consideration
troubled
Mr.
Cheesacre
as
he
rose
from
his
happy
seat
after
that
last
embrace
.
<EOS>
He
had
promised
Charlie
,
and
perhaps
he
would
keep
his
promise
,
but
it
might
be
as
well
not
to
make
it
all
too
public
at
once
.
<EOS>
But
Charlie
was
n't
going
to
be
thrown
over
;
 
not
if
she
knew
it
,
as
she
said
to
herself
.
<EOS>
She
returned
therefore
triumphantly
among
them
all
,
 
blushing
indeed
,
and
with
her
eyes
turned
away
,
and
her
hand
now
remained
upon
her
lover
's
arm
;
 
but
still
so
close
to
him
that
there
could
be
no
mistake
.
"
<EOS>
Goodness
,
gracious
,
Charlie
!
<EOS>
where
have
you
and
Mr.
Cheesacre
been
?
"
said
Mrs.
Greenow
.
<EOS>
"
We
got
up
into
the
woods
and
lost
ourselves
,
"
said
Charlie
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
indeed
,
"
said
Mrs.
Greenow
.
  
<EOS>
It
would
be
too
long
to
tell
now
,
in
these
last
pages
of
our
story
,
how
Cheesacre
strove
to
escape
,
and
with
what
skill
Mrs.
Greenow
kept
him
to
his
bargain
.
<EOS>
I
hope
that
Charlie
Fairstairs
was
duly
grateful
.
<EOS>
Before
that
evening
was
over
,
under
the
comfortable
influence
of
a
glass
of
hot
brandy
-
and
-
water
,
 
<EOS>
the
widow
had
,
I
think
,
herself
mixed
the
second
glass
for
Mr.
Cheesacre
,
before
the
influence
became
sufficiently
comfortable
,
 
he
was
forced
to
own
that
he
had
made
himself
the
happy
possessor
of
Charlie
Fairstairs
"
heart
and
hand
.
"
<EOS>
And
you
are
a
lucky
man
,
"
said
the
widow
with
enthusiasm
;
"
and
I
congratulate
you
with
all
my
heart
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
let
there
be
any
delay
now
,
because
a
good
thing
ca
n't
be
done
too
soon
.
"
<EOS>
And
indeed
,
before
that
night
was
over
,
Mrs.
Greenow
had
the
pair
together
in
her
own
presence
,
and
then
fixed
the
day
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
fellow
ought
to
be
allowed
to
turn
himself
,
"
Cheesacre
said
to
her
,
pleading
for
himself
in
a
whisper
.
<EOS>
But
no
;
Mrs.
Greenow
would
give
him
no
such
mercy
.
<EOS>
She
knew
to
what
a
man
turning
himself
might
probably
lead
.
<EOS>
She
was
a
woman
who
was
quite
in
earnest
when
she
went
to
work
,
and
I
hope
that
Miss
Fairstairs
was
grateful
.
<EOS>
Then
,
in
that
presence
,
was
in
truth
the
last
kiss
given
on
that
eventful
evening
.
<EOS>
"
Come
,
Charlie
,
be
good
-
natured
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
's
as
good
as
your
own
now
,
"
said
the
widow
.
<EOS>
And
Charlie
was
good
-
natured
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
to
be
as
soon
as
ever
we
come
back
from
our
trip
,
"
said
Mrs.
Greenow
to
Kate
,
the
next
day
,
"
and
I
'm
lending
her
money
to
get
all
her
things
at
once
.
<EOS>
He
shall
come
to
the
scratch
,
though
I
go
all
the
way
to
Norfolk
by
myself
and
fetch
him
by
his
ears
.
<EOS>
He
shall
come
,
as
sure
as
my
name
's
Greenow
,
 
or
Bellfield
,
as
it
will
be
then
,
you
know
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
should
n't
wonder
if
she
did
have
to
go
to
Norfolk
,
"
said
Kate
to
her
cousin
.
<EOS>
That
event
,
however
,
can
not
be
absolutely
concluded
in
these
pages
.
<EOS>
I
can
only
say
that
,
when
I
think
of
Mrs.
Greenow
's
force
of
character
and
warmth
of
friendship
,
I
feel
that
Miss
Fairstairs
'
prospects
stand
on
good
ground
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Greenow
's
own
marriage
was
completed
with
perfect
success
.
<EOS>
She
took
Captain
Bellfield
for
better
or
for
worse
,
with
a
thorough
determination
to
make
the
best
of
his
worst
,
and
to
put
him
on
his
legs
,
if
any
such
putting
might
be
possible
.
<EOS>
He
,
at
any
rate
,
had
been
in
luck
.
<EOS>
If
any
possible
stroke
of
fortune
could
do
him
good
,
he
had
found
that
stroke
.
<EOS>
He
had
found
a
wife
who
could
forgive
all
his
past
offences
,
 
and
also
,
if
necessary
,
some
future
offences
;
who
had
money
enough
for
all
his
wants
,
and
kindness
enough
to
gratify
them
,
and
who
had
,
moreover
,
 
which
for
the
Captain
was
the
most
important
,
 
strength
enough
to
keep
from
him
the
power
of
ruining
them
both
.
<EOS>
Reader
,
let
us
wish
a
happy
married
life
to
Captain
and
Mrs.
Bellfield
!
  
<EOS>
The
day
after
the
ceremony
Alice
Vavasor
and
Kate
Vavasor
started
for
Matching
Priory
.
   
<EOS>
Diamonds
Are
Diamonds
.
 
<EOS>
Kate
and
Alice
,
as
they
drew
near
to
their
journey
's
end
,
were
both
a
little
flurried
,
and
I
can
not
but
own
that
there
was
cause
for
nervousness
.
<EOS>
Kate
Vavasor
was
to
meet
Mr.
Grey
for
the
first
time
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Grey
was
now
staying
at
Matching
and
was
to
remain
there
until
a
week
of
his
marriage
.
<EOS>
He
was
then
to
return
to
Cambridgeshire
for
a
day
or
two
,
and
after
that
was
to
become
a
guest
at
the
rector
's
house
at
Matching
the
evening
before
the
ceremony
.
<EOS>
"
Why
not
let
him
come
here
at
once
?
"
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
had
said
to
her
husband
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
such
nonsense
,
you
know
.
"
<EOS>
But
Mr.
Palliser
would
not
hear
of
it
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
,
though
a
Radical
in
public
life
,
would
not
for
worlds
transgress
the
social
laws
of
his
ancestors
;
and
so
the
matter
was
settled
.
<EOS>
Kate
on
this
very
day
of
her
arrival
at
Matching
would
thus
see
Mr.
Grey
for
the
first
time
,
and
she
could
not
but
feel
that
she
had
been
the
means
of
doing
Mr.
Grey
much
injury
.
<EOS>
She
had
moreover
something
,
 
not
much
indeed
,
but
still
something
,
 
of
that
feeling
which
made
the
Pallisers
terrible
to
the
imagination
,
because
of
their
rank
and
wealth
.
<EOS>
She
was
a
little
afraid
of
the
Pallisers
,
but
of
Mr.
Grey
<EOS>
she
was
very
much
afraid
.
<EOS>
And
Alice
also
was
not
at
her
ease
.
<EOS>
She
would
fain
have
prevented
so
very
quick
a
marriage
<EOS>
had
she
not
felt
that
now
,
 
after
all
the
trouble
that
she
had
caused
,
 
there
was
nothing
left
for
her
but
to
do
as
others
wished
.
<EOS>
When
a
day
had
been
named
she
had
hardly
dared
to
demur
,
and
had
allowed
Lady
Glencora
to
settle
everything
as
she
had
wished
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
not
only
the
suddenness
of
her
marriage
which
dismayed
her
.
<EOS>
Its
nature
and
attributes
were
terrible
to
her
.
<EOS>
Both
Lady
Midlothian
and
the
Marchioness
of
Auld
Reekie
were
coming
.
<EOS>
When
this
was
told
to
her
by
letter
<EOS>
she
had
no
means
of
escape
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Lady
Macleod
is
right
in
nearly
all
that
she
says
,
"
Lady
Glencora
had
written
to
her
.
"
<EOS>
At
any
rate
,
you
need
n't
be
such
a
fool
as
to
run
away
from
your
cousins
,
simply
because
they
have
handles
to
their
names
.
<EOS>
You
must
take
the
thing
as
it
comes
.
"
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
,
moreover
,
had
settled
for
her
the
list
of
bridesmaids
.
<EOS>
Alice
had
made
a
petition
that
she
might
be
allowed
to
go
through
the
ceremony
with
only
one
,
 
with
none
but
Kate
to
back
her
.
<EOS>
But
she
ought
to
have
known
that
when
she
consented
to
be
married
at
Matching
,
 
and
indeed
she
had
had
very
little
power
of
resisting
that
proposition
,
 
all
such
questions
would
be
decided
for
her
.
<EOS>
Two
daughters
therefore
of
Lady
Midlothian
were
to
act
,
Lady
Jane
and
Lady
Mary
,
and
the
one
daughter
of
the
Marchioness
,
who
was
also
a
Lady
Jane
,
and
there
were
to
be
two
Miss
Howards
down
from
London
,
 
girls
who
were
known
both
to
Alice
and
to
Lady
Glencora
,
and
who
were
in
some
distant
way
connected
with
them
both
.
<EOS>
A
great
attempt
was
made
to
induce
the
two
Miss
Pallisers
to
join
the
bevy
,
but
they
had
frankly
pleaded
their
age
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
woman
should
stand
up
as
a
bridesmaid
,
"
said
the
strong
-
minded
Sophy
,
"
who
does
n't
mean
to
get
married
if
she
can
.
<EOS>
Now
I
do
n't
mean
to
get
married
,
and
I
wo
n't
put
myself
among
the
young
people
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
was
therefore
obliged
to
submit
to
do
the
work
with
only
six
.
<EOS>
But
she
swore
that
they
should
be
very
smart
.
<EOS>
She
was
to
give
all
the
dresses
,
and
Mr.
Palliser
was
to
give
a
brooch
and
an
armlet
to
each
.
<EOS>
"
She
is
the
only
person
in
the
world
I
want
to
pet
,
except
yourself
,
"
Lady
Glencora
had
said
to
her
husband
,
and
he
had
answered
by
giving
her
_
carte
blanche
_
as
regards
expense
.
  
<EOS>
All
this
was
very
terrible
to
Kate
,
who
had
not
much
feminine
taste
for
finery
.
<EOS>
Of
the
dress
she
had
heard
,
 
of
the
dress
which
was
waiting
at
Matching
to
be
made
up
after
her
arrival
,
 
though
as
yet
she
knew
nothing
of
the
trinkets
.
<EOS>
There
are
many
girls
who
could
submit
themselves
at
a
moment
to
the
kindness
of
such
a
woman
as
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
most
girls
would
do
so
,
for
of
all
such
women
in
the
world
,
Lady
Glencora
was
the
least
inclined
to
patronize
or
to
be
condescending
in
her
kindnesses
.
<EOS>
But
Kate
Vavasor
was
one
to
whom
such
submission
would
not
come
easily
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
was
out
of
this
boat
,
"
she
said
to
Alice
in
the
train
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
that
I
might
be
shipwrecked
alone
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
there
can
be
no
shipwreck
to
you
.
<EOS>
When
the
day
of
action
comes
you
will
be
taken
away
,
up
to
heaven
,
upon
the
clouds
.
<EOS>
But
what
are
they
to
do
with
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
'll
find
that
Glencora
will
not
desert
you
.
<EOS>
You
ca
n't
conceive
what
taste
she
has
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'd
sooner
be
bridesmaid
to
Charlie
Fairstairs
.
<EOS>
I
would
indeed
.
<EOS>
My
place
in
the
world
is
not
among
Cabinet
Ministers
and
old
countesses
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nor
mine
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
it
seems
that
yours
is
to
be
there
.
<EOS>
They
are
your
cousins
,
and
you
have
made
at
any
rate
one
great
friend
among
them
,
 
one
who
is
to
be
the
biggest
of
them
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
are
going
to
throw
me
over
,
Kate
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
To
tell
the
truth
,
Alice
,
I
sometimes
think
you
had
better
throw
me
over
.
<EOS>
I
know
it
would
be
sad
,
 
sad
for
both
,
but
perhaps
it
would
be
better
.
<EOS>
I
have
done
you
much
harm
and
no
good
;
and
now
where
I
am
going
I
shall
disgrace
you
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
talked
even
of
getting
out
at
some
station
and
returning
,
and
would
have
done
so
had
not
Alice
made
it
impossible
.
<EOS>
As
it
was
,
the
evening
found
her
and
Alice
together
entering
the
park
-
gate
at
Matching
,
in
Lady
Glencora
's
carriage
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
had
sent
a
note
to
the
station
.
<EOS>
"
She
could
not
come
herself
,
"
she
said
,
"
because
Mr.
Palliser
was
a
little
fussy
.
<EOS>
You
'll
understand
,
dear
,
but
do
n't
say
a
word
.
<EOS>
"
Alice
did
n't
say
a
word
,
having
been
very
anxious
not
to
lower
Mr.
Palliser
in
her
cousin
's
respect
.
  
<EOS>
None
of
the
Lady
Janes
and
Lady
Marys
were
at
Matching
when
they
arrived
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
there
was
no
guest
there
but
Mr.
Grey
,
for
which
Kate
felt
herself
to
be
extremely
grateful
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Grey
came
into
the
hall
,
standing
behind
Mr.
Palliser
,
who
stood
behind
his
wife
.
<EOS>
Alice
passed
by
them
both
,
and
was
at
once
in
her
lover
's
arms
.
<EOS>
"
Then
I
must
introduce
myself
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
to
Kate
,
"
and
my
husband
also
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
This
she
did
,
and
no
woman
in
England
could
have
excelled
her
in
the
manner
of
doing
it
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
heard
so
much
about
you
,
"
said
she
,
still
keeping
Kate
's
hand
,
"
and
<EOS>
I
know
how
good
you
've
been
;
 
and
how
wicked
you
have
been
,
"
she
added
in
a
whisper
.
<EOS>
Then
Mr.
Grey
was
brought
up
to
her
,
and
they
were
introduced
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
till
some
days
had
passed
over
them
that
she
felt
herself
at
all
at
her
ease
with
Mr.
Grey
,
and
I
doubt
whether
she
ever
reached
that
point
with
Mr.
Palliser
;
but
Lady
Glencora
she
knew
,
and
liked
,
and
almost
loved
,
from
the
first
moment
of
their
meeting
.
  
<EOS>
"
Have
you
heard
the
news
?
"
said
Lady
Glencora
to
Alice
,
the
first
minute
that
they
were
alone
.
<EOS>
Alice
,
of
course
,
had
not
heard
the
news
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Bott
is
going
to
marry
Mrs.
Marsham
.
<EOS>
There
is
such
a
row
about
it
.
<EOS>
Plantagenet
is
nearly
mad
.
<EOS>
I
never
knew
him
so
disgusted
in
my
life
.
<EOS>
Of
course
I
do
n't
dare
to
tell
him
so
,
but
I
am
so
heartily
rejoiced
.
<EOS>
You
know
how
I
love
them
both
,
and
I
could
not
possibly
wish
any
better
reward
for
either
.
<EOS>
"
Alice
,
who
had
personally
known
more
of
Mr.
Bott
than
of
Mrs.
Marsham
,
said
that
she
could
n't
but
be
sorry
for
the
lady
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
's
old
enough
to
be
his
mother
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
,
"
otherwise
I
really
do
n't
know
any
people
better
suited
to
each
other
.
<EOS>
The
best
is
,
that
Mr.
Bott
is
doing
it
to
regain
his
footing
with
Mr.
Palliser
!
<EOS>
I
am
sure
of
that
;
 
and
Plantagenet
will
never
speak
to
him
again
.
<EOS>
But
,
Alice
,
there
is
other
news
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
other
news
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
hardly
news
yet
,
and
of
course
I
am
very
wicked
to
tell
you
.
<EOS>
But
I
feel
sure
Mr.
Grey
knows
all
about
it
,
and
if
I
did
n't
tell
,
he
would
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
has
n't
told
me
anything
yet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
has
n't
had
time
;
and
when
he
does
,
you
must
n't
pretend
to
know
.
<EOS>
I
believe
Mr.
Palliser
will
certainly
be
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
before
next
month
,
and
,
if
so
,
he
'll
never
come
in
for
Silverbridge
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
he
'll
be
in
Parliament
;
<EOS>
will
he
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
yes
;
he
'll
be
in
Parliament
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
understand
all
about
it
.
<EOS>
There
is
a
man
going
out
for
the
county
,
 
for
Barsetshire
,
 
some
man
whom
the
Duke
used
to
favour
,
and
he
wants
Plantagenet
to
come
in
for
that
.
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
understand
what
difference
it
makes
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
he
will
be
in
the
Cabinet
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
yes
.
<EOS>
But
who
do
you
suppose
is
to
be
the
new
Member
for
Silverbridge
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
guess
,
"
said
Alice
.
<EOS>
Though
,
of
course
,
she
did
guess
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mind
,
I
do
n't
know
it
.
<EOS>
He
has
never
told
me
.
<EOS>
But
he
told
me
that
he
had
been
with
the
Duke
,
and
asked
the
Duke
to
let
Jeffrey
have
the
seat
.
<EOS>
The
Duke
became
as
black
as
thunder
,
and
said
that
Jeffrey
had
no
fortune
.
<EOS>
In
short
,
he
would
n't
hear
of
it
.
<EOS>
Poor
Jeffrey
!
<EOS>
we
must
try
to
do
something
for
him
,
but
I
really
do
n't
know
how
.
<EOS>
Then
the
Duke
said
,
that
Plantagenet
should
put
in
for
Silverbridge
some
friend
who
would
support
himself
;
and
I
fancy
,
 
mind
<EOS>
it
's
only
fancy
,
 
<EOS>
but
I
fancy
that
Plantagenet
mentioned
to
his
Grace
 
one
Mr.
Grey
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Glencora
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
've
been
talking
together
till
<EOS>
sometimes
I
think
Mr.
Grey
is
worse
than
Plantagenet
.
<EOS>
When
Mr.
Grey
began
to
say
something
the
other
night
in
the
drawing
-
room
about
sugar
,
I
knew
it
was
all
up
with
you
.
<EOS>
He
'll
be
a
financial
Secretary
;
you
see
if
he
is
n't
;
or
a
lord
of
something
,
or
an
under
-
somebody
of
State
;
and
then
some
day
he
'll
go
mad
,
either
because
he
does
or
because
he
does
n't
get
into
the
Cabinet
.
"
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
,
as
she
said
all
this
,
knew
well
that
the
news
she
was
giving
would
please
her
cousin
better
than
any
other
tidings
that
could
be
told
.
  
<EOS>
By
degrees
the
guests
came
.
<EOS>
The
two
Miss
Howards
were
the
first
,
and
they
expressed
themselves
as
delighted
with
Lady
Glencora
's
taste
and
with
Mr.
Palliser
's
munificence
,
 
for
at
that
time
the
brooches
and
armlets
had
been
produced
.
<EOS>
Kate
had
said
very
little
about
these
matters
,
but
the
Miss
Howards
were
loud
in
their
thanks
.
<EOS>
But
they
were
good
-
humoured
,
merry
girls
,
and
the
house
was
pleasanter
after
their
arrival
than
it
had
been
before
.
<EOS>
Then
came
the
dreaded
personage
,
 
the
guest
,
 
Lady
Midlothian
!
<EOS>
On
the
subject
of
Lady
Midlothian
Kate
had
really
become
curious
.
<EOS>
She
had
a
real
desire
to
see
the
face
and
gait
of
the
woman
,
and
to
hear
her
voice
.
<EOS>
Lady
Midlothian
came
,
and
with
her
came
Lady
Jane
and
Lady
Mary
.
<EOS>
I
am
by
no
means
sure
that
Lady
Jane
and
Lady
Mary
were
not
nearly
as
old
as
the
two
Miss
Pallisers
;
but
they
were
not
probably
so
fully
resolved
as
to
the
condition
of
their
future
modes
of
living
as
were
those
two
ladies
,
and
if
so
,
they
were
not
wrong
to
shine
as
bridesmaids
.
<EOS>
With
them
Alice
had
made
some
slight
acquaintance
during
the
last
spring
in
London
,
and
as
they
were
now
to
attend
upon
her
as
the
bride
they
were
sufficiently
gracious
.
<EOS>
To
Kate
,
too
,
they
were
civil
enough
,
and
things
,
in
public
,
went
on
very
pleasantly
at
Matching
.
  
<EOS>
A
scene
there
was
,
of
course
,
between
Alice
and
Lady
Midlothian
;
 
a
scene
in
private
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
go
through
it
,
"
Lady
Glencora
had
said
,
with
jocose
mournfulness
;
"
and
why
should
you
not
let
her
jump
upon
you
a
little
?
<EOS>
It
ca
n't
hurt
you
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
do
n't
like
people
to
jump
upon
me
,
"
Alice
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
why
are
you
to
have
everything
just
as
you
like
it
?
<EOS>
You
are
so
unreasonable
.
<EOS>
Think
how
I
've
been
jumped
on
!
<EOS>
Think
what
I
have
borne
from
them
!
<EOS>
If
you
knew
the
things
she
used
to
say
to
me
,
you
would
not
be
such
a
coward
.
<EOS>
I
was
sent
down
to
her
for
a
week
,
and
had
no
power
of
helping
myself
.
<EOS>
And
the
Marchioness
used
to
be
sent
for
to
look
at
me
,
for
she
never
talks
.
<EOS>
She
used
to
look
at
me
,
and
groan
,
and
hold
up
her
hands
till
I
hated
her
the
worst
of
the
two
.
<EOS>
Think
what
they
did
to
me
,
and
yet
they
are
my
dear
friends
now
.
<EOS>
Why
should
you
escape
altogether
?
"
  
<EOS>
Alice
could
not
escape
altogether
,
and
therefore
was
closeted
with
Lady
Midlothian
for
the
best
part
of
an
hour
.
"
<EOS>
Did
Lady
Macleod
read
to
you
what
I
wrote
?
<EOS>
"
the
Countess
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
 
that
is
,
she
gave
me
the
letter
to
read
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
hope
you
understand
me
,
Alice
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
yes
,
I
suppose
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
suppose
so
,
my
dear
!
<EOS>
If
you
only
suppose
so
I
shall
not
be
contented
.
<EOS>
I
want
you
to
appreciate
my
feelings
towards
you
thoroughly
.
<EOS>
I
want
you
to
know
that
I
am
most
anxious
as
to
your
future
life
,
and
that
I
am
thoroughly
satisfied
with
the
step
you
are
now
taking
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
Countess
paused
,
but
Alice
said
nothing
.
<EOS>
Her
tongue
was
itching
to
tell
the
old
woman
that
she
cared
nothing
for
this
expression
of
satisfaction
;
but
she
was
aware
that
she
had
done
much
that
was
deserving
of
punishment
,
and
resolved
to
take
this
as
part
of
her
penance
.
<EOS>
She
was
being
jumped
upon
,
and
it
was
unpleasant
;
but
,
after
all
that
had
happened
,
it
was
only
fitting
that
she
should
undergo
much
unpleasantness
.
"
<EOS>
Thoroughly
satisfied
,
"
continued
the
Countess
;
"
and
now
,
I
only
wish
to
refer
,
in
the
slightest
manner
possible
,
to
what
took
place
between
us
when
we
were
both
of
us
under
this
roof
last
winter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
refer
to
it
at
all
,
Lady
Midlothian
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Because
I
think
it
may
do
good
,
and
because
I
can
not
make
you
understand
that
I
have
thoroughly
forgiven
everything
,
unless
I
tell
you
that
I
have
forgiven
that
also
.
<EOS>
On
that
occasion
I
had
come
all
the
way
from
Scotland
on
purpose
to
say
a
few
words
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
so
sorry
that
you
should
have
had
the
trouble
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
regret
it
,
Alice
.
<EOS>
I
never
do
regret
doing
anything
which
I
believe
to
have
been
my
duty
.
<EOS>
There
is
no
knowing
how
far
what
I
said
then
may
have
operated
for
good
.
"
<EOS>
Alice
thought
that
she
knew
very
well
,
but
she
said
nothing
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
confess
that
what
I
then
understood
to
be
your
obstinacy
,
 
and
<EOS>
I
must
say
also
,
if
I
tell
the
truth
,
your
indifference
to
 
to
 
to
all
prudential
considerations
whatever
,
not
to
talk
of
appearances
and
decorum
,
and
I
might
say
,
anything
like
a
high
line
of
duty
or
moral
conduct
,
 
shocked
me
very
much
.
<EOS>
It
did
,
indeed
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
Taking
it
altogether
,
I
do
n't
know
that
I
was
ever
more
shocked
in
my
life
.
<EOS>
The
thing
was
so
inscrutable
!
"
<EOS>
Here
Lady
Midlothian
held
up
one
hand
in
a
manner
that
was
truly
imposing
;
"
so
inscrutable
!
<EOS>
But
that
is
all
over
now
.
<EOS>
What
was
personally
offensive
to
myself
I
could
easily
forgive
,
and
I
do
forgive
it
.
<EOS>
I
shall
never
think
of
it
any
more
.
"
<EOS>
Here
Lady
Midlothian
put
up
both
her
hands
gently
,
as
though
wafting
the
injury
away
into
the
air
.
<EOS>
"
But
what
I
wish
specially
to
say
to
you
is
this
;
your
own
conduct
is
forgiven
also
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Here
she
paused
again
,
and
Alice
winced
.
<EOS>
Who
was
this
dreadful
old
Countess
;
 
what
was
the
Countess
to
her
,
that
she
should
be
thus
tormented
with
the
old
woman
's
forgiveness
?
<EOS>
John
Grey
had
forgiven
her
,
and
of
external
forgiveness
that
was
enough
.
<EOS>
She
had
not
forgiven
herself
,
 
would
never
forgive
herself
altogether
;
and
the
pardon
of
no
old
woman
in
England
could
assist
her
in
doing
so
.
<EOS>
She
had
sinned
,
but
she
had
not
sinned
against
Lady
Midlothian
.
<EOS>
"
Let
her
jump
upon
you
,
and
have
done
with
it
,
"
Lady
Glencora
had
said
.
<EOS>
She
had
resolved
that
it
should
be
so
,
but
it
was
very
hard
to
keep
her
resolution
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
Marchioness
and
I
have
talked
it
over
,
"
continued
Lady
Midlothian
,
"
and
she
has
asked
me
to
speak
for
both
her
and
myself
.
<EOS>
"
There
is
comfort
at
any
rate
in
that
,
thought
Alice
,
who
had
never
yet
seen
the
Marchioness
.
<EOS>
"
We
have
resolved
that
all
those
little
mistakes
should
be
as
though
they
had
never
been
committed
.
<EOS>
We
shall
both
be
most
happy
to
receive
you
and
your
husband
,
who
is
,
I
must
say
,
one
of
the
most
gentlemanlike
looking
men
I
ever
saw
.
<EOS>
It
seems
that
he
and
Mr.
Palliser
are
on
most
friendly
,
 
I
may
say
,
most
confidential
terms
,
and
that
must
be
quite
a
pleasure
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
pleasure
to
him
,
which
is
more
to
the
purpose
,
"
said
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
Exactly
so
.
<EOS>
And
now
,
my
dear
,
everything
is
forgiven
and
shall
be
forgotten
.
<EOS>
Come
and
give
me
a
kiss
,
and
let
me
wish
you
joy
.
<EOS>
"
Alice
did
as
she
was
bidden
,
and
accepted
the
kiss
and
the
congratulations
,
and
a
little
box
of
jewellery
which
Lady
Midlothian
produced
from
out
of
her
pocket
.
"
The
diamonds
are
from
the
Marchioness
,
my
dear
,
whose
means
,
as
you
doubtless
are
aware
,
greatly
exceed
my
own
.
<EOS>
The
garnets
are
from
me
.
<EOS>
I
hope
they
may
both
be
worn
long
and
happily
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
hardly
know
which
was
the
worst
,
the
lecture
,
the
kiss
,
or
the
present
.
<EOS>
The
latter
she
would
have
declined
,
had
it
been
possible
;
but
it
was
not
possible
.
<EOS>
When
she
had
agreed
to
be
married
at
Matching
she
had
not
calculated
the
amount
of
punishment
which
would
thereby
be
inflicted
on
her
.
<EOS>
But
I
think
that
,
though
she
bore
it
impatiently
,
she
was
aware
that
she
had
deserved
it
.
<EOS>
Although
she
fretted
herself
greatly
under
the
infliction
of
Lady
Midlothian
,
she
acknowledged
to
herself
,
even
at
the
time
,
that
she
deserved
all
the
lashes
she
received
.
<EOS>
She
had
made
a
fool
of
herself
in
her
vain
attempt
to
be
greater
and
grander
than
other
girls
,
and
it
was
only
fair
that
her
folly
should
be
in
some
sort
punished
before
it
was
fully
pardoned
.
<EOS>
John
Grey
punished
it
after
one
fashion
;
by
declining
to
allude
to
it
,
or
to
think
of
it
,
or
to
take
any
account
of
it
.
<EOS>
And
now
Lady
Midlothian
had
punished
it
after
another
fashion
,
and
Alice
went
out
of
the
Countess
's
presence
with
sundry
inward
exclamations
of
"
mea
culpa
,
"
and
with
many
unseen
beatings
of
the
breast
.
  
<EOS>
Two
days
before
the
ceremony
came
the
Marchioness
and
her
august
daughter
.
<EOS>
Her
Lady
Jane
was
much
more
august
than
the
other
Lady
Jane
;
 
very
much
more
august
indeed
.
<EOS>
She
had
very
long
flaxen
hair
,
and
very
light
blue
eyes
,
which
she
did
not
move
frequently
,
and
she
spoke
very
little
,
 
one
may
almost
say
not
at
all
,
and
she
never
seemed
to
do
anything
.
<EOS>
But
she
was
very
august
,
and
was
,
as
all
the
world
knew
,
engaged
to
marry
the
Duke
of
Dumfriesshire
,
who
,
though
twice
her
own
age
,
was
as
yet
childless
,
as
soon
as
he
should
have
completed
his
mourning
for
his
first
wife
.
<EOS>
Kate
told
her
cousin
that
she
did
not
at
all
know
how
she
should
ever
stand
up
as
one
in
a
group
with
so
august
a
person
as
this
Lady
Jane
,
and
Alice
herself
felt
that
such
an
attendant
would
quite
obliterate
her
.
<EOS>
But
Lady
Jane
and
her
mother
were
both
harmless
.
<EOS>
The
Marchioness
never
spoke
to
Kate
and
hardly
spoke
to
Alice
,
and
the
Marchioness
's
Lady
Jane
was
quite
as
silent
as
her
mother
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
morning
of
this
day
,
 
the
day
on
which
these
very
august
people
came
,
 
a
telegram
arrived
at
the
Priory
calling
for
Mr.
Palliser
's
immediate
presence
in
London
.
<EOS>
He
came
to
Alice
full
of
regret
,
and
behaved
himself
very
nicely
.
<EOS>
Alice
now
regarded
him
quite
as
a
friend
.
<EOS>
"
Of
course
I
understand
,
"
she
said
,
"
and
I
know
that
the
business
which
takes
you
up
to
London
pleases
you
.
"
<EOS>
"
Well
;
yes
;
 
it
does
please
me
.
<EOS>
I
am
glad
,
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
mind
saying
so
to
you
.
<EOS>
But
it
does
not
please
me
to
think
that
I
shall
be
away
at
your
marriage
.
<EOS>
Pray
make
your
father
understand
that
it
was
absolutely
unavoidable
.
<EOS>
But
I
shall
see
him
,
of
course
,
when
I
come
back
.
<EOS>
And
I
shall
see
you
too
before
very
long
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Shall
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
yes
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
why
so
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Because
Mr.
Grey
must
be
at
Silverbridge
for
his
election
.
 
<EOS>
But
perhaps
I
ought
not
tell
you
his
secrets
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Then
he
took
her
into
the
breakfast
-
parlour
and
showed
her
his
present
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
service
of
Sèvres
china
,
 
very
precious
and
beautiful
.
<EOS>
"
I
got
you
these
things
because
Grey
likes
china
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
So
do
I
like
china
,
"
said
she
,
with
her
face
brighter
than
he
had
ever
yet
seen
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
thought
you
would
like
them
best
,
"
said
he
.
<EOS>
Alice
looking
up
at
him
with
her
eyes
full
of
tears
told
him
that
she
did
like
them
best
;
and
then
,
as
he
wished
her
all
happiness
,
and
as
he
was
stooping
over
her
to
kiss
her
,
Lady
Glencora
came
in
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
beg
pardon
,
"
said
she
,
"
<EOS>
I
was
just
one
minute
too
soon
;
was
I
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
would
have
them
sent
here
and
unpacked
,
"
said
Mr.
Palliser
,
"
though
I
told
her
it
was
foolish
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
I
would
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
"
Everything
shall
be
unpacked
and
shown
.
<EOS>
It
's
easy
to
get
somebody
to
pack
them
again
.
"
  
<EOS>
Much
of
the
wedding
tribute
had
already
been
deposited
with
the
china
,
and
among
other
things
there
were
the
jewels
that
Lady
Midlothian
had
brought
.
  
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
word
,
her
ladyship
's
diamonds
are
not
to
be
sneezed
at
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
care
for
diamonds
,
"
said
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
Then
Lady
Glencora
took
up
the
Countess
's
trinkets
,
and
shook
her
head
and
turned
up
her
nose
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
wonderfully
comic
expression
on
her
face
as
she
did
so
.
  
<EOS>
"
To
me
they
are
just
as
good
as
the
others
,
"
said
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
To
me
they
are
not
,
then
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
"
Diamonds
are
diamonds
,
and
garnets
are
garnets
;
and
I
am
not
so
romantic
<EOS>
but
what
I
know
the
difference
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
On
the
evening
before
the
marriage
Alice
and
Lady
Glencora
walked
for
the
last
time
through
the
Priory
ruins
.
<EOS>
It
was
now
September
,
and
the
evenings
were
still
long
,
so
that
the
ladies
could
get
out
upon
the
lawn
after
dinner
.
<EOS>
Whether
Lady
Glencora
would
have
been
allowed
to
walk
through
the
ruins
so
late
as
half
-
past
eight
in
the
evening
if
her
husband
had
been
there
may
be
doubtful
,
but
her
husband
was
away
and
she
took
this
advantage
of
his
absence
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
remember
that
night
we
were
here
?
"
said
Lady
Glencora
.
  
<EOS>
"
When
shall
I
forget
it
;
or
how
is
it
possible
that
such
a
night
should
ever
be
forgotten
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
I
shall
never
forget
it
.
<EOS>
Oh
dear
,
what
wonderful
things
have
happened
since
that
!
<EOS>
Do
you
ever
think
of
Jeffrey
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
 
of
course
I
think
of
him
.
<EOS>
I
did
like
him
so
much
.
<EOS>
I
hope
I
shall
see
him
some
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
he
liked
you
too
,
young
woman
;
and
,
what
was
more
,
young
woman
,
I
thought
at
one
time
that
,
perhaps
,
you
were
going
to
like
him
in
earnest
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
in
that
way
,
certainly
.
"
  
"
You
've
done
much
better
,
of
course
;
especially
as
poor
Jeffrey
's
chance
of
promotion
does
n't
look
so
good
now
.
<EOS>
If
I
have
a
boy
,
I
wonder
whether
he
'll
hate
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
should
he
hate
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
help
it
,
you
know
,
if
he
does
.
<EOS>
Only
think
what
it
is
to
Plantagenet
.
<EOS>
Have
you
seen
the
difference
it
makes
in
him
already
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
it
makes
a
difference
;
 
the
greatest
difference
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
think
what
it
will
be
to
me
,
Alice
.
<EOS>
I
used
to
lie
in
bed
and
wish
myself
dead
,
and
make
up
my
mind
to
drown
myself
,
 
if
I
could
only
dare
.
<EOS>
I
sha
n't
think
any
more
of
that
poor
fellow
now
.
<EOS>
"
Then
she
told
Alice
what
had
been
done
for
Burgo
;
how
his
uncle
had
paid
his
bills
once
again
,
and
had
agreed
to
give
him
a
small
income
.
"
<EOS>
Poor
fellow
!
<EOS>
"
said
Lady
Glencora
,
"
it
wo
n't
do
more
than
buy
him
gloves
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
marriage
was
magnificent
,
greatly
to
the
dismay
of
Alice
and
to
the
discomfort
of
Mr.
Vavasor
,
who
came
down
on
the
eve
of
the
ceremony
,
 
arriving
while
his
daughter
and
Lady
Glencora
were
in
the
ruins
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Grey
seemed
to
take
it
all
very
easily
,
and
,
as
Lady
Glencora
said
,
played
his
part
exactly
as
though
he
were
in
the
habit
of
being
married
,
at
any
rate
,
once
a
year
.
<EOS>
"
Nothing
on
earth
will
ever
put
him
out
,
so
you
need
not
try
,
my
dear
,
"
she
said
,
as
Alice
stood
with
her
a
moment
alone
in
the
dressing
-
room
up
-
stairs
before
her
departure
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
that
,
"
said
Alice
,
"
and
therefore
I
shall
never
try
.
<EOS>

<EOS>
The
Story
Is
Finished
Within
the
Halls
of
the
Duke
of
Omnium
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Grey
and
wife
were
duly
carried
away
from
Matching
Priory
by
post
horses
,
and
did
their
honeymoon
,
we
may
be
quite
sure
,
with
much
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
When
Alice
was
first
asked
where
she
would
go
,
she
simply
suggested
that
it
should
not
be
to
Switzerland
.
<EOS>
They
did
,
in
truth
,
go
by
slow
stages
to
Italy
,
to
Venice
,
Florence
,
and
on
to
Rome
;
but
such
had
not
been
their
intention
when
they
first
started
on
their
journey
.
<EOS>
At
that
time
Mr.
Grey
believed
that
he
would
be
wanted
again
in
England
,
down
at
Silverbridge
in
Barsetshire
,
very
shortly
.
<EOS>
But
before
he
had
married
a
week
he
learned
that
all
that
was
to
be
postponed
.
<EOS>
The
cup
of
fruition
had
not
yet
reached
Mr.
Palliser
's
lips
.
<EOS>
"
There
will
be
no
vacancy
either
in
the
county
or
in
the
borough
till
Parliament
meets
.
<EOS>
"
That
had
been
the
message
sent
by
Mr.
Palliser
to
Mr.
Grey
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
's
message
to
Alice
had
been
rather
more
full
,
having
occupied
three
pages
of
note
paper
,
the
last
of
which
had
been
crossed
,
but
I
do
not
know
that
it
was
more
explicit
.
<EOS>
She
had
abused
Lord
Brock
,
had
abused
Mr.
Finespun
,
and
had
abused
all
public
things
and
institutions
,
because
the
arrangements
as
now
proposed
would
be
very
comfortable
to
Alice
,
but
would
not
,
as
she
was
pleased
to
think
,
be
very
comfortable
to
herself
.
<EOS>
"
You
can
go
to
Rome
and
see
everything
and
enjoy
yourself
,
which
I
was
not
allowed
to
do
;
and
all
this
noise
and
bother
,
and
crowd
of
electioneering
,
will
take
place
down
in
Barsetshire
just
when
I
am
in
the
middle
of
all
my
trouble
.
<EOS>
"
There
were
many
very
long
letters
came
from
Lady
Glencora
to
Rome
during
the
winter
,
 
letters
which
Alice
enjoyed
thoroughly
,
but
which
she
could
not
but
regard
as
being
very
indiscreet
.
<EOS>
The
Duke
was
at
the
Castle
during
the
Christmas
week
,
and
the
descriptions
of
the
Duke
and
of
his
solicitude
as
to
his
heir
were
very
comic
.
"
<EOS>
He
comes
and
bends
over
me
on
the
sofa
in
the
most
stupendous
way
,
as
though
a
woman
to
be
the
mother
of
his
heir
must
be
a
miracle
in
nature
.
<EOS>
He
is
quite
awful
when
he
says
a
word
or
two
,
and
more
awful
in
his
silence
.
<EOS>
The
devil
prompted
me
the
other
day
,
and
I
said
I
hoped
it
would
be
a
girl
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
look
came
over
his
face
which
nearly
frightened
me
.
<EOS>
If
it
should
be
,
I
believe
he
will
turn
me
out
of
the
house
;
but
how
can
I
help
it
?
<EOS>
I
wish
you
were
going
to
have
a
baby
at
the
same
time
.
<EOS>
Then
,
if
yours
was
a
boy
and
mine
a
girl
,
we
'd
make
a
change
.
<EOS>
"
This
was
very
indiscreet
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
would
write
indiscreet
letters
like
this
,
which
Alice
could
not
show
to
her
husband
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
thousand
pities
.
  
<EOS>
But
December
and
January
wore
themselves
away
,
and
the
time
came
in
which
the
Greys
were
bound
to
return
to
England
.
<EOS>
The
husband
had
very
fully
discussed
with
his
wife
that
matter
of
his
parliamentary
ambition
,
and
found
in
her
a
very
ready
listener
.
<EOS>
Having
made
up
his
mind
to
do
this
thing
,
he
was
resolved
to
do
it
thoroughly
,
and
was
becoming
almost
as
full
of
politics
,
almost
as
much
devoted
to
sugar
,
as
Mr.
Palliser
himself
.
<EOS>
He
at
any
rate
could
not
complain
that
his
wife
would
not
interest
herself
in
his
pursuits
.
<EOS>
Then
,
as
they
returned
,
came
letters
from
Lady
Glencora
,
written
as
her
troubles
grew
nigh
.
<EOS>
The
Duke
had
gone
,
of
course
;
but
he
was
to
be
there
at
the
appointed
time
.
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
do
so
wish
he
would
have
a
fit
of
the
gout
in
London
,
 
or
at
Timbuctoo
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
When
they
reached
London
they
first
heard
the
news
from
Mr.
Vavasor
,
who
on
this
occasion
condescended
to
meet
them
at
the
railway
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
Duke
has
got
an
heir
,
"
he
said
,
before
the
carriage
-
door
was
open
;
 
"
born
this
morning
!
<EOS>
"
One
might
have
supposed
that
it
was
the
Duke
's
baby
,
and
not
the
baby
of
Lady
Glencora
and
Mr.
Palliser
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
note
from
Mr.
Palliser
to
Mr.
Grey
.
"
<EOS>
Thank
God
!
"
<EOS>
said
the
note
,
"
Lady
Glencora
and
the
boy
"
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
had
scorned
to
use
the
word
child
 
<EOS>
"
Lady
Glencora
and
the
boy
are
quite
as
well
as
can
be
expected
.
<EOS>
Both
the
new
writs
were
moved
for
last
night
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
's
honours
,
as
will
be
seen
,
came
rushing
upon
him
all
at
once
.
  
<EOS>
Wondrous
little
baby
,
 
_
purpureo
genitus
!
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
What
have
the
gods
not
done
for
thee
,
if
thou
canst
only
manage
to
live
till
thy
<EOS>
good
things
are
all
thine
own
,
 
to
live
through
all
the
terrible
solicitude
with
which
they
will
envelope
thee
!
<EOS>
Better
than
royal
rank
will
be
thine
,
with
influence
more
than
royal
,
and
power
of
action
fettered
by
no
royalty
.
<EOS>
Royal
wealth
which
will
be
really
thine
own
,
to
do
with
it
as
it
beseemeth
thee
.
<EOS>
Thou
wilt
be
at
the
top
of
an
aristocracy
in
a
country
where
aristocrats
need
gird
themselves
with
no
buckram
.
<EOS>
All
that
the
world
can
give
will
be
thine
;
and
yet
when
we
talk
of
thee
religiously
,
philosophically
,
or
politico
-
economically
,
we
are
wo
nt
to
declare
that
thy
chances
of
happiness
are
no
better
,
 
no
better
,
if
they
be
no
worse
,
 
than
are
those
of
thine
infant
neighbour
just
born
,
in
that
farmyard
cradle
.
<EOS>
Who
shall
say
that
they
are
better
or
that
they
are
worse
?
<EOS>
Or
if
they
be
better
,
or
if
they
be
worse
,
how
shall
we
reconcile
to
ourselves
that
seeming
injustice
?
  
<EOS>
And
now
we
will
pay
a
little
visit
to
the
small
one
born
in
the
purple
,
and
the
story
of
that
visit
shall
be
the
end
of
our
history
.
<EOS>
It
was
early
in
April
,
quite
early
in
April
,
and
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Grey
were
both
at
Gatherum
Castle
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Grey
was
there
at
the
moment
of
which
we
write
,
but
Mr.
Grey
was
absent
at
Silverbridge
with
Mr.
Palliser
.
<EOS>
This
was
the
day
of
the
Silverbridge
election
,
and
Mr.
Grey
had
gone
to
that
ancient
borough
,
to
offer
himself
as
a
candidate
to
the
electors
,
backed
by
the
presence
and
aid
of
a
very
powerful
member
of
the
Cabinet
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
and
Alice
were
sitting
up
-
stairs
with
the
small
,
purple
-
born
one
in
their
presence
,
and
the
small
,
purple
-
born
one
was
lying
in
Alice
's
lap
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
such
a
comfort
that
it
is
over
,
"
said
the
mother
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
the
most
ungrateful
of
women
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Alice
,
 
if
you
could
have
known
!
<EOS>
Your
baby
may
come
just
as
it
pleases
.
<EOS>
You
wo
n't
lie
awake
trembling
how
on
earth
you
will
bear
your
disgrace
if
one
of
the
vile
weaker
sex
should
come
to
disturb
the
hopes
of
your
lords
and
masters
;
 
for
I
had
two
,
which
made
it
so
much
more
terrible
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
sure
Mr.
Palliser
would
not
have
said
a
word
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
he
would
have
said
nothing
,
 
nor
would
the
Duke
.
<EOS>
The
Duke
would
simply
have
gone
away
instantly
,
and
never
have
seen
me
again
till
the
next
chance
comes
,
 
if
it
ever
does
come
.
<EOS>
And
Mr.
Palliser
would
have
been
as
gentle
as
a
dove
;
 
much
more
gentle
than
he
is
now
,
for
men
are
rarely
gentle
in
their
triumph
.
<EOS>
But
I
should
have
known
what
they
both
thought
and
felt
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
all
right
now
,
dear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
my
bonny
boy
,
 
you
have
made
it
all
right
for
me
;
 
have
you
not
?
"
<EOS>
And
Lady
Glencora
took
her
baby
into
her
own
arms
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
made
everything
right
,
my
little
man
.
<EOS>
But
oh
,
Alice
,
if
you
had
seen
the
Duke
's
long
face
through
those
three
days
;
if
you
had
heard
the
tones
of
the
people
's
voices
as
they
whispered
about
me
;
if
you
had
encountered
the
oppressive
cheerfulness
of
those
two
London
doctors
,
 
doctors
are
such
bad
actors
,
 
you
would
have
thought
it
impossible
for
any
woman
to
live
throughout
.
<EOS>
There
's
one
comfort
;
 
if
my
mannikin
lives
,
I
ca
n't
have
another
eldest
.
<EOS>
He
looks
like
living
;
 
do
n't
he
,
Alice
?
"
<EOS>
Then
were
perpetrated
various
mysterious
ceremonies
of
feminine
idolatry
which
were
continued
till
there
came
a
grandly
dressed
old
lady
,
who
called
herself
the
nurse
,
and
who
took
the
idol
away
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
course
of
that
afternoon
Lady
Glencora
took
Alice
all
over
the
house
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
castle
of
enormous
size
,
quite
new
,
 
having
been
built
by
the
present
proprietor
,
 
very
cold
,
very
handsome
,
and
very
dull
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
an
immense
place
!
<EOS>
"
said
Alice
,
as
she
stood
looking
round
her
in
the
grand
hall
,
which
was
never
used
as
an
entrance
except
on
very
grand
occasions
.
<EOS>
"
Is
it
not
?
<EOS>
And
it
cost
 
<EOS>
oh
,
I
ca
n't
tell
you
how
much
it
cost
.
<EOS>
A
hundred
thousand
pounds
or
more
.
<EOS>
Well
;
 
that
would
be
nothing
,
as
the
Duke
no
doubt
had
the
money
in
his
pocket
to
do
what
he
liked
with
at
the
time
.
<EOS>
But
the
joke
is
,
nobody
ever
thinks
of
living
here
.
<EOS>
Who
'd
live
in
such
a
great
,
overgrown
place
such
as
this
,
if
they
could
get
a
comfortable
house
like
Matching
?
<EOS>
Do
you
remember
Longroyston
and
the
hot
-
water
pipes
?
<EOS>
I
always
think
of
the
poor
Duchess
when
I
come
through
here
.
<EOS>
Nobody
ever
lives
here
,
or
ever
will
.
<EOS>
The
Duke
comes
for
one
week
in
the
year
,
and
Plantagenet
says
he
hates
to
do
that
.
<EOS>
As
for
me
,
nothing
on
earth
shall
ever
make
me
live
here
.
<EOS>
I
was
completely
in
their
power
and
could
n't
help
their
bringing
me
here
the
other
day
;
 
because
I
had
,
as
it
were
,
disgraced
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
disgraced
yourself
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
In
being
so
long
,
you
know
,
before
that
gentleman
was
born
.
<EOS>
But
they
sha
n't
play
me
the
same
trick
again
.
<EOS>
I
shall
dare
to
assert
myself
,
now
.
<EOS>
Come
,
 
we
must
go
away
.
<EOS>
There
are
some
of
the
British
public
come
to
see
one
of
the
British
sights
.
<EOS>
That
's
another
pleasure
here
.
<EOS>
One
has
to
run
about
to
avoid
being
caught
by
the
visitors
.
<EOS>
The
housekeeper
tells
me
they
always
grumble
because
they
are
not
allowed
to
go
into
my
little
room
up
-
stairs
.
"
  
<EOS>
On
the
evening
of
that
day
Mr.
Palliser
and
Mr.
Grey
returned
home
from
Silverbridge
together
.
<EOS>
The
latter
was
then
a
Member
of
Parliament
,
but
the
former
at
that
moment
was
the
possessor
of
no
such
dignity
.
<EOS>
The
election
for
the
borough
was
now
over
,
whereas
that
for
the
county
had
not
yet
taken
place
.
<EOS>
But
there
was
no
rival
candidate
for
the
position
,
and
Mr.
Palliser
was
thoroughly
contented
with
his
fate
.
<EOS>
He
was
at
this
moment
actually
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
,
and
in
about
ten
days
"
time
would
be
on
his
legs
in
the
House
proposing
for
his
country
's
use
his
scheme
of
finance
.
<EOS>
The
two
men
were
seated
together
in
an
open
carriage
,
and
were
being
whirled
along
by
four
horses
.
<EOS>
They
were
both
no
doubt
happy
in
their
ambition
,
but
I
think
that
of
the
two
,
Mr.
Palliser
showed
his
triumph
the
most
.
<EOS>
Not
that
he
spoke
even
to
his
friend
a
word
that
was
triumphant
in
its
tone
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
thus
that
he
rejoiced
.
<EOS>
He
was
by
nature
too
placid
for
that
.
<EOS>
But
there
was
a
nervousness
in
his
contentment
which
told
the
tale
to
any
observer
who
might
know
how
to
read
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
'll
like
it
,
"
he
said
to
Grey
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
never
like
it
as
you
do
,
"
Grey
answered
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
why
not
;
 
why
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
In
the
first
place
,
I
have
not
begun
it
so
young
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Any
time
before
thirty
-
five
is
young
enough
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
For
useful
work
,
yes
,
 
but
hardly
for
enjoyment
in
the
thing
.
<EOS>
And
then
I
do
n't
believe
it
all
as
you
do
.
<EOS>
To
you
the
British
House
of
Commons
is
everything
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
;
 
everything
,
"
said
Mr.
Palliser
with
unwonted
enthusiasm
;
 
"
everything
,
everything
.
<EOS>
That
and
the
Constitution
are
everything
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
so
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
but
it
will
be
.
<EOS>
If
you
really
take
to
the
work
,
and
put
yourself
into
harness
,
it
will
be
so
.
<EOS>
You
'll
get
to
feel
it
as
I
do
.
<EOS>
The
man
who
is
counted
by
his
colleagues
as
number
one
on
the
Treasury
Bench
in
the
English
House
of
Commons
,
is
the
first
of
living
men
.
<EOS>
That
's
my
opinion
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
that
I
ever
said
it
before
;
but
that
's
my
opinion
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
who
is
the
second
;
 
the
purse
-
bearer
to
this
great
man
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
say
nothing
about
the
second
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
that
there
is
any
second
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
how
we
shall
find
Lady
Glencora
and
the
boy
.
<EOS>
"
They
had
then
arrived
at
the
side
entrance
to
the
Castle
,
and
Mr.
Grey
ran
up
-
stairs
to
his
wife
's
room
to
receive
her
congratulations
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
are
a
Member
of
Parliament
?
<EOS>
"
she
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
tell
me
so
,
but
I
do
n't
know
whether
I
actually
am
one
till
I
've
taken
the
oaths
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
so
happy
.
<EOS>
There
's
no
position
in
the
world
so
glorious
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
pity
<EOS>
you
are
not
Mr.
Palliser
's
wife
.
<EOS>
That
's
just
what
he
has
been
saying
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
John
,
I
am
so
happy
.
<EOS>
It
is
so
much
more
than
I
have
deserved
.
<EOS>
I
hope
,
 
that
is
,
I
sometimes
think
 
"
  
"
Think
what
,
dearest
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
nothing
that
I
have
ever
said
has
driven
you
to
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'd
do
more
than
that
,
dear
,
to
make
you
happy
,
"
he
said
,
as
he
put
his
arm
round
her
and
kissed
her
;
"
more
than
that
,
at
least
if
it
were
in
my
power
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Probably
my
readers
may
agree
with
Alice
,
that
in
the
final
adjustment
of
her
affairs
she
had
received
more
than
she
had
deserved
.
<EOS>
All
her
friends
,
except
her
husband
,
thought
so
.
<EOS>
But
as
they
have
all
forgiven
her
,
including
even
Lady
Midlothian
herself
,
I
hope
that
they
who
have
followed
her
story
to
its
close
will
not
be
less
generous
.
