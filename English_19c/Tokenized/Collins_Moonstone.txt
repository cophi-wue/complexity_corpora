THE
STORMING
OF
SERINGAPATAM
(
1799
)
Extracted
from
a
Family
Paper
  
<EOS>
I
address
these
lines
 
written
in
India
 
to
my
relatives
in
England
.
  
<EOS>
My
object
is
to
explain
the
motive
which
has
induced
me
to
refuse
the
right
hand
of
friendship
to
my
cousin
,
John
Herncastle
.
<EOS>
The
reserve
which
I
have
hitherto
maintained
in
this
matter
has
been
misinterpreted
by
members
of
my
family
whose
good
opinion
I
can
not
consent
to
forfeit
.
<EOS>
I
request
them
to
suspend
their
decision
until
they
have
read
my
narrative
.
<EOS>
And
I
declare
,
on
my
word
of
honour
,
that
what
I
am
now
about
to
write
is
,
strictly
and
literally
,
the
truth
.
  
<EOS>
The
private
difference
between
my
cousin
and
me
took
its
rise
in
a
great
public
event
in
which
we
were
both
concerned
 
the
storming
of
Seringapatam
,
under
General
Baird
,
on
the
4th
of
May
,
1799
.
  
<EOS>
In
order
that
the
circumstances
may
be
clearly
understood
,
I
must
revert
for
a
moment
to
the
period
before
the
assault
,
and
to
the
stories
current
in
our
camp
of
the
treasure
in
jewels
and
gold
stored
up
in
the
Palace
of
Seringapatam
.
    
<EOS>
One
of
the
wildest
of
these
stories
related
to
a
Yellow
Diamond
 
a
famous
gem
in
the
native
annals
of
India
.
  
<EOS>
The
earliest
known
traditions
describe
the
stone
as
having
been
set
in
the
forehead
of
the
four
-
handed
Indian
god
who
typifies
the
Moon
.
<EOS>
Partly
from
its
peculiar
colour
,
partly
from
a
superstition
which
represented
it
as
feeling
the
influence
of
the
deity
whom
it
adorned
,
and
growing
and
lessening
in
lustre
with
the
waxing
and
waning
of
the
moon
,
it
first
gained
the
name
by
which
it
continues
to
be
known
in
India
to
this
day
 
<EOS>
the
name
of
THE
MOONSTONE
.
<EOS>
A
similar
superstition
was
once
prevalent
,
as
I
have
heard
,
in
ancient
Greece
and
Rome
;
not
applying
,
however
(
as
in
India
)
,
to
a
diamond
devoted
to
the
service
of
a
god
,
but
to
a
semi
-
transparent
stone
of
the
inferior
order
of
gems
,
supposed
to
be
affected
by
the
lunar
influences
 
the
moon
,
in
this
latter
case
also
,
giving
the
name
by
which
the
stone
is
still
known
to
collectors
in
our
own
time
.
  
<EOS>
The
adventures
of
the
Yellow
Diamond
begin
with
the
eleventh
century
of
the
Christian
era
.
  
<EOS>
At
that
date
,
the
Mohammedan
conqueror
,
Mahmoud
of
Ghizni
,
crossed
India
;
seized
on
the
holy
city
of
Somnauth
;
and
stripped
of
its
treasures
the
famous
temple
,
which
had
stood
for
centuries
 
the
shrine
of
Hindoo
pilgrimage
,
and
the
wonder
of
the
Eastern
world
.
  
<EOS>
Of
all
the
deities
worshipped
in
the
temple
,
the
moon
-
god
alone
escaped
the
rapacity
of
the
conquering
Mohammedans
.
<EOS>
Preserved
by
three
Brahmins
,
the
inviolate
deity
,
bearing
the
Yellow
Diamond
in
its
forehead
,
was
removed
by
night
,
and
was
transported
to
the
second
of
the
sacred
cities
of
India
 
<EOS>
the
city
of
Benares
.
  
<EOS>
Here
,
in
a
new
shrine
 
in
a
hall
inlaid
with
precious
stones
,
under
a
roof
supported
by
pillars
of
gold
 
<EOS>
the
moon
-
god
was
set
up
and
worshipped
.
<EOS>
Here
,
on
the
night
when
the
shrine
was
completed
,
Vishnu
the
Preserver
appeared
to
the
three
Brahmins
in
a
dream
.
  
<EOS>
The
deity
breathed
the
breath
of
his
divinity
on
the
Diamond
in
the
forehead
of
the
god
.
<EOS>
And
the
Brahmins
knelt
and
hid
their
faces
in
their
robes
.
<EOS>
The
deity
commanded
that
the
Moonstone
should
be
watched
,
from
that
time
forth
,
by
three
priests
in
turn
,
night
and
day
,
to
the
end
of
the
generations
of
men
.
<EOS>
And
the
Brahmins
heard
,
and
bowed
before
his
will
.
<EOS>
The
deity
predicted
certain
disaster
to
the
presumptuous
mortal
who
laid
hands
on
the
sacred
gem
,
and
to
all
of
his
house
and
name
who
received
it
after
him
.
<EOS>
And
the
Brahmins
caused
the
prophecy
to
be
written
over
the
gates
of
the
shrine
in
letters
of
gold
.
  
<EOS>
One
age
followed
another
 
and
still
,
generation
after
generation
,
the
successors
of
the
three
Brahmins
watched
their
priceless
Moonstone
,
night
and
day
.
<EOS>
One
age
followed
another
until
the
first
years
of
the
eighteenth
Christian
century
saw
the
reign
of
Aurungzebe
,
Emperor
of
the
Moguls
.
<EOS>
At
his
command
havoc
and
rapine
were
let
loose
once
more
among
the
temples
of
the
worship
of
Brahmah
.
<EOS>
The
shrine
of
the
four
-
handed
god
was
polluted
by
the
slaughter
of
sacred
animals
;
the
images
of
the
deities
were
broken
in
pieces
;
and
the
Moonstone
was
seized
by
an
officer
of
rank
in
the
army
of
Aurungzebe
.
  
<EOS>
Powerless
to
recover
their
lost
treasure
by
open
force
,
the
three
guardian
priests
followed
and
watched
it
in
disguise
.
<EOS>
The
generations
succeeded
each
other
;
the
warrior
who
had
committed
the
sacrilege
perished
miserably
;
the
Moonstone
passed
(
carrying
its
curse
with
it
)
from
one
lawless
Mohammedan
hand
to
another
;
and
still
,
through
all
chances
and
changes
,
the
successors
of
the
three
guardian
priests
kept
their
watch
,
waiting
the
day
when
the
will
of
Vishnu
the
Preserver
should
restore
to
them
their
sacred
gem
.
<EOS>
Time
rolled
on
from
the
first
to
the
last
years
of
the
eighteenth
Christian
century
.
<EOS>
The
Diamond
fell
into
the
possession
of
Tippoo
,
Sultan
of
Seringapatam
,
who
caused
it
to
be
placed
as
an
ornament
in
the
handle
of
a
dagger
,
and
who
commanded
it
to
be
kept
among
the
choicest
treasures
of
his
armoury
.
<EOS>
Even
then
 
in
the
palace
of
the
Sultan
himself
 
the
three
guardian
priests
still
kept
their
watch
in
secret
.
<EOS>
There
were
three
officers
of
Tippoo
's
household
,
strangers
to
the
rest
,
who
had
won
their
master
's
confidence
by
conforming
,
or
appearing
to
conform
,
to
the
Mussulman
faith
;
and
to
those
three
men
report
pointed
as
the
three
priests
in
disguise
.
    
<EOS>
So
,
as
told
in
our
camp
,
ran
the
fanciful
story
of
the
Moonstone
.
<EOS>
It
made
no
serious
impression
on
any
of
us
except
my
cousin
 
whose
love
of
the
marvellous
induced
him
to
believe
it
.
<EOS>
On
the
night
before
the
assault
on
Seringapatam
,
he
was
absurdly
angry
with
me
,
and
with
others
,
for
treating
the
whole
thing
as
a
fable
.
<EOS>
A
foolish
wrangle
followed
;
and
Herncastle
's
unlucky
temper
got
the
better
of
him
.
<EOS>
He
declared
,
in
his
boastful
way
,
that
we
should
see
the
Diamond
on
his
finger
,
if
the
English
army
took
Seringapatam
.
<EOS>
The
sally
was
saluted
by
a
roar
of
laughter
,
and
there
,
as
we
all
thought
that
night
,
the
thing
ended
.
  
<EOS>
Let
me
now
take
you
on
to
the
day
of
the
assault
.
<EOS>
My
cousin
and
I
were
separated
at
the
outset
.
<EOS>
I
never
saw
him
when
we
forded
the
river
;
when
we
planted
the
English
flag
in
the
first
breach
;
when
we
crossed
the
ditch
beyond
;
and
,
fighting
every
inch
of
our
way
,
entered
the
town
.
<EOS>
It
was
only
at
dusk
,
when
the
place
was
ours
,
and
after
General
Baird
himself
had
found
the
dead
body
of
Tippoo
under
a
heap
of
the
slain
,
that
Herncastle
and
I
met
.
  
<EOS>
We
were
each
attached
to
a
party
sent
out
by
the
general
's
orders
to
prevent
the
plunder
and
confusion
which
followed
our
conquest
.
<EOS>
The
camp
-
followers
committed
deplorable
excesses
;
and
,
worse
still
,
the
soldiers
found
their
way
,
by
a
guarded
door
,
into
the
treasury
of
the
Palace
,
and
loaded
themselves
with
gold
and
jewels
.
<EOS>
It
was
in
the
court
outside
the
treasury
that
my
cousin
and
I
met
,
to
enforce
the
laws
of
discipline
on
our
own
soldiers
.
<EOS>
Herncastle
's
fiery
temper
had
been
,
as
I
could
plainly
see
,
exasperated
to
a
kind
of
frenzy
by
the
terrible
slaughter
through
which
we
had
passed
.
<EOS>
He
was
very
unfit
,
in
my
opinion
,
to
perform
the
duty
that
had
been
entrusted
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
riot
and
confusion
enough
in
the
treasury
,
but
no
violence
that
I
saw
.
<EOS>
The
men
(
if
I
may
use
such
an
expression
)
disgraced
themselves
good
-
humouredly
.
<EOS>
All
sorts
of
rough
jests
and
catchwords
were
bandied
about
among
them
;
and
the
story
of
the
Diamond
turned
up
again
unexpectedly
,
in
the
form
of
a
mischievous
joke
.
<EOS>
"
Who
's
got
the
Moonstone
?
<EOS>
"
was
the
rallying
cry
which
perpetually
caused
the
plundering
,
as
soon
as
it
was
stopped
in
one
place
,
to
break
out
in
another
.
<EOS>
While
I
was
still
vainly
trying
to
establish
order
,
I
heard
a
frightful
yelling
on
the
other
side
of
the
courtyard
,
and
at
once
ran
towards
the
cries
,
in
dread
of
finding
some
new
outbreak
of
the
pillage
in
that
direction
.
  
<EOS>
I
got
to
an
open
door
,
and
saw
the
bodies
of
two
Indians
(
by
their
dress
,
as
I
guessed
,
officers
of
the
palace
)
lying
across
the
entrance
,
dead
.
  
<EOS>
A
cry
inside
hurried
me
into
a
room
,
which
appeared
to
serve
as
an
armoury
.
<EOS>
A
third
Indian
,
mortally
wounded
,
was
sinking
at
the
feet
of
a
man
whose
back
was
towards
me
.
<EOS>
The
man
turned
at
the
instant
when
I
came
in
,
and
I
saw
John
Herncastle
,
with
a
torch
in
one
hand
,
and
a
dagger
dripping
with
blood
in
the
other
.
<EOS>
A
stone
,
set
like
a
pommel
,
in
the
end
of
the
dagger
's
handle
,
flashed
in
the
torchlight
,
as
he
turned
on
me
,
like
a
gleam
of
fire
.
<EOS>
The
dying
Indian
sank
to
his
knees
,
pointed
to
the
dagger
in
Herncastle
's
hand
,
and
said
,
in
his
native
language
 
<EOS>
"
The
Moonstone
will
have
its
vengeance
yet
on
you
and
yours
!
"
<EOS>
He
spoke
those
words
,
and
fell
dead
on
the
floor
.
  
<EOS>
Before
I
could
stir
in
the
matter
,
the
men
who
had
followed
me
across
the
courtyard
crowded
in
.
<EOS>
My
cousin
rushed
to
meet
them
,
like
a
madman
.
<EOS>
"
Clear
the
room
!
"
he
shouted
to
me
,
"
and
set
a
guard
on
the
door
!
"
<EOS>
The
men
fell
back
as
he
threw
himself
on
them
with
his
torch
and
his
dagger
.
<EOS>
I
put
two
sentinels
of
my
own
company
,
on
whom
I
could
rely
,
to
keep
the
door
.
<EOS>
Through
the
remainder
of
the
night
,
I
saw
no
more
of
my
cousin
.
  
<EOS>
Early
in
the
morning
,
the
plunder
still
going
on
,
General
Baird
announced
publicly
by
beat
of
drum
,
that
any
thief
detected
in
the
fact
,
be
he
whom
he
might
,
should
be
hung
.
<EOS>
The
provost
-
marshal
was
in
attendance
,
to
prove
that
the
General
was
in
earnest
;
and
in
the
throng
that
followed
the
proclamation
,
Herncastle
and
I
met
again
.
  
<EOS>
He
held
out
his
hand
,
as
usual
,
and
said
,
"
Good
morning
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
waited
before
I
gave
him
my
hand
in
return
.
  
<EOS>
"
Tell
me
first
,
"
I
said
,
"
how
the
Indian
in
the
armoury
met
his
death
,
and
what
those
last
words
meant
,
when
he
pointed
to
the
dagger
in
your
hand
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
Indian
met
his
death
,
as
I
suppose
,
by
a
mortal
wound
,
"
said
Herncastle
.
<EOS>
"
What
his
last
words
meant
I
know
no
more
than
you
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
looked
at
him
narrowly
.
<EOS>
His
frenzy
of
the
previous
day
had
all
calmed
down
.
<EOS>
I
determined
to
give
him
another
chance
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
that
all
you
have
to
tell
me
?
"
I
asked
.
  
<EOS>
He
answered
,
"
That
is
all
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
turned
my
back
on
him
;
and
we
have
not
spoken
since
.
    
<EOS>
I
beg
it
to
be
understood
<EOS>
that
what
I
write
here
about
my
cousin
(
unless
some
necessity
should
arise
for
making
it
public
)
is
for
the
information
of
the
family
only
.
<EOS>
Herncastle
has
said
nothing
that
can
justify
me
in
speaking
to
our
commanding
officer
.
<EOS>
He
has
been
taunted
more
than
once
about
the
Diamond
,
by
those
who
recollect
his
angry
outbreak
before
the
assault
;
but
,
as
may
easily
be
imagined
,
his
own
remembrance
of
the
circumstances
under
which
I
surprised
him
in
the
armoury
has
been
enough
to
keep
him
silent
.
<EOS>
It
is
reported
that
he
means
to
exchange
into
another
regiment
,
avowedly
for
the
purpose
of
separating
himself
from
ME
.
  
<EOS>
Whether
this
be
true
or
not
,
I
can
not
prevail
upon
myself
to
become
his
accuser
 
<EOS>
and
I
think
with
good
reason
.
<EOS>
If
I
made
the
matter
public
,
I
have
no
evidence
but
moral
evidence
to
bring
forward
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
only
no
proof
that
he
killed
the
two
men
at
the
door
;
I
can
not
even
declare
that
he
killed
the
third
man
inside
 
for
I
can
not
say
that
my
own
eyes
saw
the
deed
committed
.
<EOS>
It
is
true
that
I
heard
the
dying
Indian
's
words
;
but
if
those
words
were
pronounced
to
be
the
ravings
of
delirium
,
how
could
I
contradict
the
assertion
from
my
own
knowledge
?
<EOS>
Let
our
relatives
,
on
either
side
,
form
their
own
opinion
on
what
I
have
written
,
and
decide
for
themselves
whether
the
aversion
I
now
feel
towards
this
man
is
well
or
ill
founded
.
  
<EOS>
Although
I
attach
no
sort
of
credit
to
the
fantastic
Indian
legend
of
the
gem
,
I
must
acknowledge
,
before
I
conclude
,
that
I
am
influenced
by
a
certain
superstition
of
my
own
in
this
matter
.
<EOS>
It
is
my
conviction
,
or
my
delusion
,
no
matter
which
,
that
crime
brings
its
own
fatality
with
it
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
only
persuaded
of
Herncastle
's
guilt
;
I
am
even
fanciful
enough
to
believe
that
he
will
live
to
regret
it
,
if
he
keeps
the
Diamond
;
and
that
others
will
live
to
regret
taking
it

THE
STORY
  
FIRST
PERIOD
  
<EOS>
THE
LOSS
OF
THE
DIAMOND
(
1848
)
  
<EOS>
The
events
related
by
GABRIEL
BETTEREDGE
,
house
-
steward
in
the
service
of
JULIA
,
LADY
VERINDER
.
      
<EOS>
In
the
first
part
of
ROBINSON
CRUSOE
,
at
page
one
hundred
and
twenty
-
nine
,
you
will
find
it
thus
written
:
  
"
<EOS>
Now
I
saw
,
though
too
late
,
the
Folly
of
beginning
a
Work
before
we
count
the
Cost
,
and
before
we
judge
rightly
of
our
own
Strength
to
go
through
with
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Only
yesterday
,
I
opened
my
ROBINSON
CRUSOE
at
that
place
.
<EOS>
Only
this
morning
(
May
twenty
-
first
,
Eighteen
hundred
and
fifty
)
,
came
my
lady
's
nephew
,
Mr.
Franklin
Blake
,
and
held
a
short
conversation
with
me
,
as
follows
:
    
"
Betteredge
,
"
says
Mr.
Franklin
,
"
I
have
been
to
the
lawyer
's
about
some
family
matters
;
and
,
among
other
things
,
we
have
been
talking
of
the
loss
of
the
Indian
Diamond
,
in
my
aunt
's
house
in
Yorkshire
,
two
years
since
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bruff
thinks
as
I
think
,
that
the
whole
story
ought
,
in
the
interests
of
truth
,
to
be
placed
on
record
in
writing
 
and
the
sooner
the
better
.
"
  
<EOS>
Not
perceiving
his
drift
yet
,
and
thinking
it
always
desirable
for
the
sake
of
peace
and
quietness
to
be
on
the
lawyer
's
side
,
I
said
I
thought
so
too
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Franklin
went
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
In
this
matter
of
the
Diamond
,
"
he
said
,
"
the
characters
of
innocent
people
have
suffered
under
suspicion
already
 
as
you
know
.
<EOS>
The
memories
of
innocent
people
may
suffer
,
hereafter
,
for
want
of
a
record
of
the
facts
to
which
those
who
come
after
us
can
appeal
.
<EOS>
There
can
be
no
doubt
that
this
strange
family
story
of
ours
ought
to
be
told
.
<EOS>
And
I
think
,
Betteredge
,
Mr.
Bruff
and
I
together
have
hit
on
the
right
way
of
telling
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Very
satisfactory
to
both
of
them
,
no
doubt
.
<EOS>
But
I
failed
to
see
what
I
myself
had
to
do
with
it
,
so
far
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
have
certain
events
to
relate
,
"
Mr.
Franklin
proceeded
;
"
and
we
have
certain
persons
concerned
in
those
events
who
are
capable
of
relating
them
.
<EOS>
Starting
from
these
plain
facts
,
the
idea
is
that
we
should
all
write
the
story
of
the
Moonstone
in
turn
 
as
far
as
our
own
personal
experience
extends
,
and
no
farther
.
<EOS>
We
must
begin
by
showing
how
the
Diamond
first
fell
into
the
hands
of
my
uncle
Herncastle
,
when
he
was
serving
in
India
fifty
years
since
.
<EOS>
This
prefatory
narrative
I
have
already
got
by
me
in
the
form
of
an
old
family
paper
,
which
relates
the
necessary
particulars
on
the
authority
of
an
eye
-
witness
.
<EOS>
The
next
thing
to
do
is
to
tell
how
the
Diamond
found
its
way
into
my
aunt
's
house
in
Yorkshire
,
two
years
ago
,
and
how
it
came
to
be
lost
in
little
more
than
twelve
hours
afterwards
.
<EOS>
Nobody
knows
as
much
as
you
do
,
Betteredge
,
about
what
went
on
in
the
house
at
that
time
.
<EOS>
So
you
must
take
the
pen
in
hand
,
and
start
the
story
.
"
  
<EOS>
In
those
terms
I
was
informed
of
what
my
personal
concern
was
with
the
matter
of
the
Diamond
.
<EOS>
If
you
are
curious
to
know
what
course
I
took
under
the
circumstances
,
I
beg
to
inform
you
that
I
did
what
you
would
probably
have
done
in
my
place
.
<EOS>
I
modestly
declared
myself
to
be
quite
unequal
to
the
task
imposed
upon
me
 
<EOS>
and
I
privately
felt
,
all
the
time
,
that
I
was
quite
clever
enough
to
perform
it
,
if
I
only
gave
my
own
abilities
a
fair
chance
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Franklin
,
I
imagine
,
must
have
seen
my
private
sentiments
in
my
face
.
<EOS>
He
declined
to
believe
in
my
modesty
;
and
he
insisted
on
giving
my
abilities
a
fair
chance
.
  
<EOS>
Two
hours
have
passed
since
Mr.
Franklin
left
me
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
his
back
was
turned
,
I
went
to
my
writing
desk
to
start
the
story
.
<EOS>
There
I
have
sat
helpless
(
in
spite
of
my
abilities
)
ever
since
;
seeing
what
Robinson
Crusoe
saw
,
as
quoted
above
 
namely
,
the
folly
of
beginning
a
work
before
we
count
the
cost
,
and
before
we
judge
rightly
of
our
own
strength
to
go
through
with
it
.
<EOS>
Please
to
remember
,
I
opened
the
book
by
accident
,
at
that
bit
,
only
the
day
before
I
rashly
undertook
the
business
now
in
hand
;
and
,
allow
me
to
ask
 
if
THAT
is
n't
prophecy
,
what
is
?
  
<EOS>
I
am
not
superstitious
;
I
have
read
a
heap
of
books
in
my
time
;
I
am
a
scholar
in
my
own
way
.
<EOS>
Though
turned
seventy
,
I
possess
an
active
memory
,
and
legs
to
correspond
.
<EOS>
You
are
not
to
take
it
,
if
you
please
,
as
the
saying
of
an
ignorant
man
,
when
I
express
my
opinion
that
such
a
book
as
ROBINSON
CRUSOE
never
was
written
,
and
never
will
be
written
again
.
<EOS>
I
have
tried
that
book
for
years
 
generally
in
combination
with
a
pipe
of
tobacco
 
<EOS>
and
I
have
found
it
my
friend
in
need
in
all
the
necessities
of
this
mortal
life
.
<EOS>
When
my
spirits
are
bad
 
ROBINSON
CRUSOE
.
<EOS>
When
I
want
advice
 
ROBINSON
CRUSOE
.
<EOS>
In
past
times
when
my
wife
plagued
me
;
in
present
times
when
I
have
had
a
drop
too
much
 
<EOS>
ROBINSON
CRUSOE
.
<EOS>
I
have
worn
out
six
stout
ROBINSON
CRUSOES
with
hard
work
in
my
service
.
<EOS>
On
my
lady
's
last
birthday
she
gave
me
a
seventh
.
<EOS>
I
took
a
drop
too
much
on
the
strength
of
it
;
and
ROBINSON
CRUSOE
put
me
right
again
.
<EOS>
Price
four
shillings
and
sixpence
,
bound
in
blue
,
with
a
picture
into
the
bargain
.
  
<EOS>
Still
,
this
do
n't
look
much
like
starting
the
story
of
the
Diamond
 
does
it
?
<EOS>
I
seem
to
be
wandering
off
in
search
of
Lord
knows
what
,
Lord
knows
where
.
<EOS>
We
will
take
a
new
sheet
of
paper
,
if
you
please
,
and
begin
over
again
,
with
my
best
respects
to
you
.
    
<EOS>
I
spoke
of
my
lady
a
line
or
two
back
.
<EOS>
Now
the
Diamond
could
never
have
been
in
our
house
,
where
it
was
lost
,
if
it
had
not
been
made
a
present
of
to
my
lady
's
daughter
;
and
my
lady
's
daughter
would
never
have
been
in
existence
to
have
the
present
,
if
it
had
not
been
for
my
lady
who
(
with
pain
and
travail
)
produced
her
into
the
world
.
<EOS>
Consequently
,
if
we
begin
with
my
lady
,
we
are
pretty
sure
of
beginning
far
enough
back
.
<EOS>
And
that
,
let
me
tell
you
,
when
you
have
got
such
a
job
as
mine
in
hand
,
is
a
real
comfort
at
starting
.
  
<EOS>
If
you
know
anything
of
the
fashionable
world
,
you
have
heard
tell
of
the
three
beautiful
Miss
Herncastles
.
<EOS>
Miss
Adelaide
;
Miss
Caroline
;
and
Miss
Julia
 
<EOS>
this
last
being
the
youngest
and
the
best
of
the
three
sisters
,
in
my
opinion
;
and
I
had
opportunities
of
judging
,
as
you
shall
presently
see
.
<EOS>
I
went
into
the
service
of
the
old
lord
,
their
father
(
thank
God
,
we
have
got
nothing
to
do
with
him
,
in
this
business
of
the
Diamond
;
he
had
the
longest
tongue
and
the
shortest
temper
of
any
man
,
high
or
low
,
I
ever
met
with
)
 
<EOS>
I
say
,
<EOS>
I
went
into
the
service
of
the
old
lord
,
as
page
-
boy
in
waiting
on
the
three
honourable
young
ladies
,
at
the
age
of
fifteen
years
.
<EOS>
There
I
lived
till
Miss
Julia
married
the
late
Sir
John
Verinder
.
<EOS>
An
excellent
man
,
who
only
wanted
somebody
to
manage
him
;
and
,
between
ourselves
<EOS>
,
he
found
somebody
to
do
it
;
and
what
is
more
,
he
throve
on
it
and
grew
fat
on
it
,
and
lived
happy
and
died
easy
on
it
,
dating
from
the
day
when
my
lady
took
him
to
church
to
be
married
,
to
the
day
when
she
relieved
him
of
his
last
breath
,
and
closed
his
eyes
for
ever
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
omitted
to
state
that
I
went
with
the
bride
to
the
bride
's
husband
's
house
and
lands
down
here
.
"
<EOS>
Sir
John
,
"
she
says
,
"
I
ca
n't
do
without
Gabriel
Betteredge
.
"
<EOS>
"
My
lady
,
"
says
Sir
John
,
"
I
ca
n't
do
without
him
,
either
.
<EOS>
"
That
was
his
way
with
her
 
and
that
was
how
I
went
into
his
service
.
<EOS>
It
was
all
one
to
me
where
I
went
,
so
long
as
my
mistress
and
I
were
together
.
  
<EOS>
Seeing
that
my
lady
took
an
interest
in
the
out
-
of
-
door
work
,
and
the
farms
,
and
such
like
,
I
took
an
interest
in
them
too
 
with
all
the
more
reason
that
I
was
a
small
farmer
's
seventh
son
myself
.
<EOS>
My
lady
got
me
put
under
the
bailiff
,
and
I
did
my
best
,
and
gave
satisfaction
,
and
got
promotion
accordingly
.
<EOS>
Some
years
later
,
on
the
Monday
as
it
might
be
,
my
lady
says
,
"
Sir
John
,
your
bailiff
is
a
stupid
old
man
.
<EOS>
Pension
him
liberally
,
and
let
Gabriel
Betteredge
have
his
place
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
On
the
Tuesday
as
it
might
be
,
Sir
John
says
,
"
My
lady
,
the
bailiff
is
pensioned
liberally
;
and
Gabriel
Betteredge
has
got
his
place
.
<EOS>
"
You
hear
more
than
enough
of
married
people
living
together
miserably
.
<EOS>
Here
is
an
example
to
the
contrary
.
<EOS>
Let
it
be
a
warning
to
some
of
you
,
and
an
encouragement
to
others
.
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
,
I
will
go
on
with
my
story
.
  
<EOS>
Well
,
there
I
was
in
clover
,
you
will
say
.
<EOS>
Placed
in
a
position
of
trust
and
honour
,
with
a
little
cottage
of
my
own
to
live
in
,
with
my
rounds
on
the
estate
to
occupy
me
in
the
morning
,
and
my
accounts
in
the
afternoon
,
and
my
pipe
and
my
ROBINSON
CRUSOE
in
the
evening
 
<EOS>
what
more
could
I
possibly
want
to
make
me
happy
?
<EOS>
Remember
what
Adam
wanted
when
he
was
alone
in
the
Garden
of
Eden
;
and
if
you
do
n't
blame
it
in
Adam
,
do
n't
blame
it
in
me
.
  
<EOS>
The
woman
I
fixed
my
eye
on
,
was
the
woman
who
kept
house
for
me
at
my
cottage
.
<EOS>
Her
name
was
Selina
Goby
.
<EOS>
I
agree
with
the
late
William
Cobbett
about
picking
a
wife
.
<EOS>
See
that
she
chews
her
food
well
and
sets
her
foot
down
firmly
on
the
ground
when
she
walks
,
and
you
're
all
right
.
<EOS>
Selina
Goby
was
all
right
in
both
these
respects
,
which
was
one
reason
for
marrying
her
.
<EOS>
I
had
another
reason
,
likewise
,
entirely
of
my
own
discovering
.
<EOS>
Selina
,
being
a
single
woman
,
made
me
pay
so
much
a
week
for
her
board
and
services
.
<EOS>
Selina
,
being
my
wife
,
could
n't
charge
for
her
board
,
and
would
have
to
give
me
her
services
for
nothing
.
<EOS>
That
was
the
point
of
view
I
looked
at
it
from
.
<EOS>
Economy
 
with
a
dash
of
love
.
<EOS>
I
put
it
to
my
mistress
,
as
in
duty
bound
,
just
as
I
had
put
it
to
myself
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
turning
Selina
Goby
over
in
my
mind
,
"
I
said
,
"
and
I
think
,
my
lady
,
it
will
be
cheaper
to
marry
her
than
to
keep
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
My
lady
burst
out
laughing
,
and
said
she
did
n't
know
which
to
be
most
shocked
at
 
my
language
or
my
principles
.
<EOS>
Some
joke
tickled
her
,
I
suppose
,
of
the
sort
that
you
ca
n't
take
unless
you
are
a
person
of
quality
.
<EOS>
Understanding
nothing
myself
but
that
I
was
free
to
put
it
next
to
Selina
,
I
went
and
put
it
accordingly
.
<EOS>
And
what
did
Selina
say
?
<EOS>
Lord
!
<EOS>
how
little
you
must
know
of
women
,
if
you
ask
that
.
<EOS>
Of
course
she
said
,
Yes
.
  
<EOS>
As
my
time
drew
nearer
,
and
there
got
to
be
talk
of
my
having
a
new
coat
for
the
ceremony
,
my
mind
began
to
misgive
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
compared
notes
with
other
men
as
to
what
they
felt
while
they
were
in
my
interesting
situation
;
and
they
have
all
acknowledged
that
,
about
a
week
before
it
happened
,
they
privately
wished
themselves
out
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
went
a
trifle
further
than
that
myself
;
I
actually
rose
up
,
as
it
were
,
and
tried
to
get
out
of
it
.
<EOS>
Not
for
nothing
!
<EOS>
I
was
too
just
a
man
to
expect
she
would
let
me
off
for
nothing
.
<EOS>
Compensation
to
the
woman
when
the
man
gets
out
of
it
,
is
one
of
the
laws
of
England
.
<EOS>
In
obedience
to
the
laws
,
and
after
turning
it
over
carefully
in
my
mind
,
I
offered
Selina
Goby
a
feather
-
bed
and
fifty
shillings
to
be
off
the
bargain
.
<EOS>
You
will
hardly
believe
it
,
but
it
is
nevertheless
true
 
<EOS>
she
was
fool
enough
to
refuse
.
  
<EOS>
After
that
it
was
all
over
with
me
,
of
course
.
<EOS>
I
got
the
new
coat
as
cheap
as
I
could
,
and
I
went
through
all
the
rest
of
it
as
cheap
as
I
could
.
<EOS>
We
were
not
a
happy
couple
,
and
not
a
miserable
couple
.
<EOS>
We
were
six
of
one
and
half
-
a
-
dozen
of
the
other
.
<EOS>
How
it
was
I
do
n't
understand
,
but
we
always
seemed
to
be
getting
,
with
the
best
of
motives
,
in
one
another
's
way
.
<EOS>
When
I
wanted
to
go
up
-
stairs
,
there
was
my
wife
coming
down
;
or
when
my
wife
wanted
to
go
down
,
there
was
I
coming
up
.
<EOS>
That
is
married
life
,
according
to
my
experience
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
After
five
years
of
misunderstandings
on
the
stairs
,
it
pleased
an
all
-
wise
Providence
to
relieve
us
of
each
other
by
taking
my
wife
.
<EOS>
I
was
left
with
my
little
girl
Penelope
,
and
with
no
other
child
.
<EOS>
Shortly
afterwards
Sir
John
died
,
and
my
lady
was
left
with
her
little
girl
,
Miss
Rachel
,
and
no
other
child
.
<EOS>
I
have
written
to
very
poor
purpose
of
my
lady
,
if
you
require
to
be
told
that
my
little
Penelope
was
taken
care
of
,
under
my
good
mistress
's
own
eye
,
and
was
sent
to
school
and
taught
,
and
made
a
sharp
girl
,
and
promoted
,
when
old
enough
,
to
be
Miss
Rachel
's
own
maid
.
  
<EOS>
As
for
me
,
I
went
on
with
my
business
as
bailiff
year
after
year
up
to
Christmas
1847
,
when
there
came
a
change
in
my
life
.
<EOS>
On
that
day
,
my
lady
invited
herself
to
a
cup
of
tea
alone
with
me
in
my
cottage
.
<EOS>
She
remarked
that
,
reckoning
from
the
year
when
I
started
as
page
-
boy
in
the
time
of
the
old
lord
,
I
had
been
more
than
fifty
years
in
her
service
,
and
she
put
into
my
hands
a
beautiful
waistcoat
of
wool
that
she
had
worked
herself
,
to
keep
me
warm
in
the
bitter
winter
weather
.
  
<EOS>
I
received
this
magnificent
present
quite
at
a
loss
to
find
words
to
thank
my
mistress
with
for
the
honour
she
had
done
me
.
<EOS>
To
my
great
astonishment
,
it
turned
out
,
however
,
that
the
waistcoat
was
not
an
honour
,
but
a
bribe
.
<EOS>
My
lady
had
discovered
that
I
was
getting
old
before
I
had
discovered
it
myself
,
and
she
had
come
to
my
cottage
to
wheedle
me
(
if
I
may
use
such
an
expression
)
into
giving
up
my
hard
out
-
of
-
door
work
as
bailiff
,
and
taking
my
ease
for
the
rest
of
my
days
as
steward
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
I
made
as
good
a
fight
of
it
against
the
indignity
of
taking
my
ease
as
I
could
.
<EOS>
But
my
mistress
knew
the
weak
side
of
me
;
she
put
it
as
a
favour
to
herself
.
<EOS>
The
dispute
between
us
ended
,
after
that
,
in
my
wiping
my
eyes
,
like
an
old
fool
,
with
my
new
woollen
waistcoat
,
and
saying
I
would
think
about
it
.
  
<EOS>
The
perturbation
in
my
mind
,
in
regard
to
thinking
about
it
,
being
truly
dreadful
after
my
lady
had
gone
away
<EOS>
,
I
applied
the
remedy
which
I
have
never
yet
found
to
fail
me
in
cases
of
doubt
and
emergency
.
<EOS>
I
smoked
a
pipe
and
took
a
turn
at
ROBINSON
CRUSOE
.
<EOS>
Before
I
had
occupied
myself
with
that
extraordinary
book
five
minutes
,
I
came
on
a
comforting
bit
(
page
one
hundred
and
fifty
-
eight
)
,
as
follows
:
"
To
-
day
we
love
,
what
to
-
morrow
we
hate
.
<EOS>
"
I
saw
my
way
clear
directly
.
<EOS>
To
-
day
I
was
all
for
continuing
to
be
farm
-
bailiff
;
to
-
morrow
,
on
the
authority
of
ROBINSON
CRUSOE
,
I
should
be
all
the
other
way
.
<EOS>
Take
myself
to
-
morrow
while
in
to
-
morrow
's
humour
,
and
the
thing
was
done
.
<EOS>
My
mind
being
relieved
in
this
manner
,
I
went
to
sleep
that
night
in
the
character
of
Lady
Verinder
's
farm
bailiff
,
and
I
woke
up
the
next
morning
in
the
character
of
Lady
Verinder
's
house
-
steward
.
<EOS>
All
quite
comfortable
,
and
all
through
ROBINSON
CRUSOE
!
  
<EOS>
My
daughter
Penelope
has
just
looked
over
my
shoulder
to
see
what
I
have
done
so
far
.
<EOS>
She
remarks
that
it
is
beautifully
written
,
and
every
word
of
it
true
.
<EOS>
But
she
points
out
one
objection
.
<EOS>
She
says
what
I
have
done
so
far
is
n't
in
the
least
what
I
was
wanted
to
do
.
<EOS>
I
am
asked
to
tell
the
story
of
the
Diamond
and
,
instead
of
that
,
I
have
been
telling
the
story
of
my
own
self
.
<EOS>
Curious
,
and
quite
beyond
me
to
account
for
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
whether
the
gentlemen
who
make
a
business
and
a
living
out
of
writing
books
,
ever
find
their
own
selves
getting
in
the
way
of
their
subjects
,
like
me
?
<EOS>
If
they
do
,
I
can
feel
for
them
.
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
,
here
is
another
false
start
,
and
more
waste
of
good
writing
-
paper
.
<EOS>
What
's
to
be
done
now
?
<EOS>
Nothing
that
I
know
of
,
except
for
you
to
keep
your
temper
,
and
for
me
to
begin
it
all
over
again
for
the
third
time
.
    
<EOS>
The
question
of
how
I
am
to
start
the
story
properly
I
have
tried
to
settle
in
two
ways
.
<EOS>
First
,
by
scratching
my
head
,
which
led
to
nothing
.
<EOS>
Second
,
by
consulting
my
daughter
Penelope
,
which
has
resulted
in
an
entirely
new
idea
.
  
<EOS>
Penelope
's
notion
is
that
I
should
set
down
what
happened
,
regularly
day
by
day
,
beginning
with
the
day
when
we
got
the
news
that
Mr.
Franklin
Blake
was
expected
on
a
visit
to
the
house
.
<EOS>
When
you
come
to
fix
your
memory
with
a
date
in
this
way
,
it
is
wonderful
what
your
memory
will
pick
up
for
you
upon
that
compulsion
.
<EOS>
The
only
difficulty
is
to
fetch
out
the
dates
,
in
the
first
place
.
<EOS>
This
Penelope
offers
to
do
for
me
by
looking
into
her
own
diary
,
which
she
was
taught
to
keep
when
she
was
at
school
,
and
which
she
has
gone
on
keeping
ever
since
.
<EOS>
In
answer
to
an
improvement
on
this
notion
,
devised
by
myself
,
namely
,
that
she
should
tell
the
story
instead
of
me
,
out
of
her
own
diary
,
Penelope
observes
,
with
a
fierce
look
and
a
red
face
,
that
her
journal
is
for
her
own
private
eye
,
and
that
no
living
creature
shall
ever
know
what
is
in
it
but
herself
.
<EOS>
When
I
inquire
what
this
means
,
Penelope
says
,
"
Fiddlesticks
!
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
Sweethearts
.
  
<EOS>
Beginning
,
then
,
on
Penelope
's
plan
,
I
beg
to
mention
that
I
was
specially
called
one
Wednesday
morning
into
my
lady
's
own
sitting
-
room
,
the
date
being
the
twenty
-
fourth
of
May
,
Eighteen
hundred
and
forty
-
eight
.
  
<EOS>
"
Gabriel
,
"
says
my
lady
,
"
here
is
news
that
will
surprise
you
.
<EOS>
Franklin
Blake
has
come
back
from
abroad
.
<EOS>
He
has
been
staying
with
his
father
in
London
,
and
he
is
coming
to
us
to
-
morrow
to
stop
till
next
month
,
and
keep
Rachel
's
birthday
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
If
I
had
had
a
hat
in
my
hand
,
nothing
but
respect
would
have
prevented
me
from
throwing
that
hat
up
to
the
ceiling
.
<EOS>
I
had
not
seen
Mr.
Franklin
since
he
was
a
boy
,
living
along
with
us
in
this
house
.
<EOS>
He
was
,
out
of
all
sight
(
as
I
remember
him
)
,
the
nicest
boy
that
ever
spun
a
top
or
broke
a
window
.
<EOS>
Miss
Rachel
,
who
was
present
,
and
to
whom
I
made
that
remark
,
observed
,
in
return
,
that
SHE
remembered
him
as
the
most
atrocious
tyrant
that
ever
tortured
a
doll
,
and
the
hardest
driver
of
an
exhausted
little
girl
in
string
harness
that
England
could
produce
.
<EOS>
"
I
burn
with
indignation
,
and
I
ache
with
fatigue
,
"
was
the
way
Miss
Rachel
summed
it
up
,
"
when
I
think
of
Franklin
Blake
.
"
  
<EOS>
Hearing
what
I
now
tell
you
,
you
will
naturally
ask
how
it
was
that
Mr.
Franklin
should
have
passed
all
the
years
,
from
the
time
when
he
was
a
boy
to
the
time
when
he
was
a
man
,
out
of
his
own
country
.
<EOS>
I
answer
,
because
his
father
had
the
misfortune
to
be
next
heir
to
a
Dukedom
,
and
not
to
be
able
to
prove
it
.
  
<EOS>
In
two
words
,
this
was
how
the
thing
happened
:
  
My
lady
's
eldest
sister
married
the
celebrated
Mr.
Blake
 
equally
famous
for
his
great
riches
,
and
his
great
suit
at
law
.
<EOS>
How
many
years
he
went
on
worrying
the
tribunals
of
his
country
to
turn
out
the
Duke
in
possession
,
and
to
put
himself
in
the
Duke
's
place
 
how
many
lawyer
's
purses
he
filled
to
bursting
,
and
how
many
otherwise
harmless
people
he
set
by
the
ears
together
disputing
whether
he
was
right
or
wrong
 
<EOS>
is
more
by
a
great
deal
than
I
can
reckon
up
.
<EOS>
His
wife
died
,
and
two
of
his
three
children
died
,
before
the
tribunals
could
make
up
their
minds
to
show
him
the
door
and
take
no
more
of
his
money
.
<EOS>
When
it
was
all
over
,
and
the
Duke
in
possession
was
left
in
possession
,
Mr.
Blake
discovered
that
the
only
way
of
being
even
with
his
country
for
the
manner
in
which
it
had
treated
him
,
was
not
to
let
his
country
have
the
honour
of
educating
his
son
.
<EOS>
"
How
can
I
trust
my
native
institutions
,
"
was
the
form
in
which
he
put
it
,
"
after
the
way
in
which
my
native
institutions
have
behaved
to
ME
?
"
<EOS>
Add
to
this
,
that
Mr.
Blake
disliked
all
boys
,
his
own
included
,
and
you
will
admit
that
it
could
only
end
in
one
way
.
<EOS>
Master
Franklin
was
taken
from
us
in
England
,
and
was
sent
to
institutions
which
his
father
COULD
trust
,
in
that
superior
country
,
Germany
;
Mr.
Blake
himself
,
you
will
observe
,
remaining
snug
in
England
,
to
improve
his
fellow
-
countrymen
in
the
Parliament
House
,
and
to
publish
a
statement
on
the
subject
of
the
Duke
in
possession
,
which
has
remained
an
unfinished
statement
from
that
day
to
this
.
  
<EOS>
There
!
<EOS>
thank
God
,
that
's
told
!
<EOS>
Neither
you
nor
I
need
trouble
our
heads
any
more
about
Mr.
Blake
,
senior
.
<EOS>
Leave
him
to
the
Dukedom
;
and
let
you
and
I
stick
to
the
Diamond
.
  
<EOS>
The
Diamond
takes
us
back
to
Mr.
Franklin
,
who
was
the
innocent
means
of
bringing
that
unlucky
jewel
into
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
Our
nice
boy
did
n't
forget
us
after
he
went
abroad
.
<EOS>
He
wrote
every
now
and
then
;
sometimes
to
my
lady
,
sometimes
to
Miss
Rachel
,
and
sometimes
to
me
.
<EOS>
We
had
had
a
transaction
together
,
before
he
left
,
which
consisted
in
his
borrowing
of
me
a
ball
of
string
,
a
four
-
bladed
knife
,
and
seven
-
and
-
sixpence
in
money
 
the
colour
of
which
<EOS>
last
I
have
not
seen
,
and
never
expect
to
see
again
.
<EOS>
His
letters
to
me
chiefly
related
to
borrowing
more
.
<EOS>
I
heard
,
however
,
from
my
lady
,
how
he
got
on
abroad
,
as
he
grew
in
years
and
stature
.
<EOS>
After
he
had
learnt
what
the
institutions
of
Germany
could
teach
him
,
he
gave
the
French
a
turn
next
,
and
the
Italians
a
turn
after
that
.
<EOS>
They
made
him
among
them
a
sort
of
universal
genius
,
as
well
as
I
could
understand
it
.
<EOS>
He
wrote
a
little
;
he
painted
a
little
;
he
sang
and
played
and
composed
a
little
 
borrowing
,
as
I
suspect
,
in
all
these
cases
,
just
as
he
had
borrowed
from
me
.
<EOS>
His
mother
's
fortune
(
seven
hundred
a
year
)
fell
to
him
when
he
came
of
age
,
and
ran
through
him
,
as
it
might
be
through
a
sieve
.
<EOS>
The
more
money
he
had
,
the
more
he
wanted
;
there
was
a
hole
in
Mr.
Franklin
's
pocket
that
nothing
would
sew
up
.
<EOS>
Wherever
he
went
,
the
lively
,
easy
way
of
him
made
him
welcome
.
<EOS>
He
lived
here
,
there
,
and
everywhere
;
his
address
(
as
he
used
to
put
it
himself
)
being
"
Post
Office
,
Europe
 
to
be
left
till
called
for
.
"
<EOS>
Twice
over
,
he
made
up
his
mind
to
come
back
to
England
and
see
us
;
and
twice
over
(
saving
your
presence
)
,
some
unmentionable
woman
stood
in
the
way
and
stopped
him
.
<EOS>
His
third
attempt
succeeded
,
as
you
know
already
from
what
my
lady
told
me
.
<EOS>
On
Thursday
the
twenty
-
fifth
of
May
,
we
were
to
see
for
the
first
time
what
our
nice
boy
had
grown
to
be
as
a
man
.
<EOS>
He
came
of
good
blood
;
he
had
a
high
courage
;
and
he
was
five
-
and
-
twenty
years
of
age
,
by
our
reckoning
.
<EOS>
Now
you
know
as
much
of
Mr.
Franklin
Blake
as
I
did
 
before
Mr.
Franklin
Blake
came
down
to
our
house
.
  
<EOS>
The
Thursday
was
as
fine
a
summer
's
day
as
ever
you
saw
:
and
my
lady
and
Miss
Rachel
(
not
expecting
Mr.
Franklin
till
dinner
-
time
)
drove
out
to
lunch
with
some
friends
in
the
neighbourhood
.
  
<EOS>
When
they
were
gone
,
I
went
and
had
a
look
at
the
bedroom
which
had
been
got
ready
for
our
guest
,
and
saw
that
all
was
straight
.
<EOS>
Then
,
being
butler
in
my
lady
's
establishment
,
as
well
as
steward
(
at
my
own
particular
request
,
mind
,
and
because
it
vexed
me
to
see
anybody
but
myself
in
possession
of
the
key
of
the
late
Sir
John
's
cellar
)
 
<EOS>
then
,
I
say
,
I
fetched
up
some
of
our
famous
Latour
claret
,
and
set
it
in
the
warm
summer
air
to
take
off
the
chill
before
dinner
.
<EOS>
Concluding
to
set
myself
in
the
warm
summer
air
next
 
seeing
that
what
is
good
for
old
claret
is
equally
good
for
old
age
 
<EOS>
I
took
up
my
beehive
chair
to
go
out
into
the
back
court
,
when
I
was
stopped
by
hearing
a
sound
like
the
soft
beating
of
a
drum
,
on
the
terrace
in
front
of
my
lady
's
residence
.
  
<EOS>
Going
round
to
the
terrace
,
I
found
three
mahogany
-
coloured
Indians
,
in
white
linen
frocks
and
trousers
,
looking
up
at
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
The
Indians
,
as
I
saw
on
looking
closer
,
had
small
hand
-
drums
slung
in
front
of
them
.
<EOS>
Behind
them
stood
a
little
delicate
-
looking
light
-
haired
English
boy
carrying
a
bag
.
<EOS>
I
judged
the
fellows
to
be
strolling
conjurors
,
and
the
boy
with
the
bag
to
be
carrying
the
tools
of
their
trade
.
<EOS>
One
of
the
three
,
who
spoke
English
and
who
exhibited
,
I
must
own
,
the
most
elegant
manners
,
presently
informed
me
that
my
judgment
was
right
.
<EOS>
He
requested
permission
to
show
his
tricks
in
the
presence
of
the
lady
of
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
Now
I
am
not
a
sour
old
man
.
<EOS>
I
am
generally
all
for
amusement
,
and
the
last
person
in
the
world
to
distrust
another
person
because
he
happens
to
be
a
few
shades
darker
than
myself
.
<EOS>
But
the
best
of
us
have
our
weaknesses
 
and
my
weakness
,
when
I
know
a
family
plate
-
basket
to
be
out
on
a
pantry
-
table
,
is
to
be
instantly
reminded
of
that
basket
by
the
sight
of
a
strolling
stranger
whose
manners
are
superior
to
my
own
.
<EOS>
I
accordingly
informed
the
Indian
that
the
lady
of
the
house
was
out
;
and
I
warned
him
and
his
party
off
the
premises
.
<EOS>
He
made
me
a
beautiful
bow
in
return
;
and
he
and
his
party
went
off
the
premises
.
<EOS>
On
my
side
,
I
returned
to
my
beehive
chair
,
and
set
myself
down
on
the
sunny
side
of
the
court
,
and
fell
(
if
the
truth
must
be
owned
)
,
not
exactly
into
a
sleep
,
but
into
the
next
best
thing
to
it
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
roused
up
by
my
daughter
Penelope
running
out
at
me
as
if
the
house
was
on
fire
.
<EOS>
What
do
you
think
she
wanted
?
<EOS>
She
wanted
to
have
the
three
Indian
jugglers
instantly
taken
up
;
for
this
reason
,
namely
,
that
they
knew
who
was
coming
from
London
to
visit
us
,
and
that
they
meant
some
mischief
to
Mr.
Franklin
Blake
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Franklin
's
name
roused
me
.
<EOS>
I
opened
my
eyes
,
and
made
my
girl
explain
herself
.
  
<EOS>
It
appeared
that
Penelope
had
just
come
from
our
lodge
,
where
she
had
been
having
a
gossip
with
the
lodge
-
keeper
's
daughter
.
<EOS>
The
two
girls
had
seen
the
Indians
pass
out
,
after
I
had
warned
them
off
,
followed
by
their
little
boy
.
<EOS>
Taking
it
into
their
heads
that
the
boy
was
ill
-
used
by
the
foreigners
 
for
no
reason
that
I
could
discover
,
except
that
he
was
pretty
and
delicate
-
looking
 
<EOS>
the
two
girls
had
stolen
along
the
inner
side
of
the
hedge
between
us
and
the
road
,
and
had
watched
the
proceedings
of
the
foreigners
on
the
outer
side
.
<EOS>
Those
proceedings
resulted
in
the
performance
of
the
following
extraordinary
tricks
.
  
<EOS>
They
first
looked
up
the
road
,
and
down
the
road
,
and
made
sure
that
they
were
alone
.
<EOS>
Then
they
all
three
faced
about
,
and
stared
hard
in
the
direction
of
our
house
.
<EOS>
Then
they
jabbered
and
disputed
in
their
own
language
,
and
looked
at
each
other
like
men
in
doubt
.
<EOS>
Then
they
all
turned
to
their
little
English
boy
,
as
if
they
expected
HIM
to
help
them
.
<EOS>
And
then
the
chief
Indian
,
who
spoke
English
,
said
to
the
boy
,
"
Hold
out
your
hand
.
"
  
<EOS>
On
hearing
those
dreadful
words
,
my
daughter
Penelope
said
she
did
n't
know
what
prevented
her
heart
from
flying
straight
out
of
her
.
<EOS>
I
thought
privately
that
it
might
have
been
her
stays
.
<EOS>
All
I
said
,
however
,
was
,
"
You
make
my
flesh
creep
.
"
<EOS>
(
NOTA
BENE
:
<EOS>
Women
like
these
little
compliments
.
)
  
<EOS>
Well
,
when
the
Indian
said
,
"
Hold
out
your
hand
,
"
the
boy
shrunk
back
,
and
shook
his
head
,
and
said
he
did
n't
like
it
.
<EOS>
The
Indian
,
thereupon
,
asked
him
(
not
at
all
unkindly
)
,
whether
he
would
like
to
be
sent
back
to
London
,
and
left
where
they
had
found
him
,
sleeping
in
an
empty
basket
in
a
market
 
a
hungry
,
ragged
,
and
forsaken
little
boy
.
<EOS>
This
,
it
seems
,
ended
the
difficulty
.
<EOS>
The
little
chap
unwillingly
held
out
his
hand
.
<EOS>
Upon
that
,
the
Indian
took
a
bottle
from
his
bosom
,
and
poured
out
of
it
some
black
stuff
,
like
ink
,
into
the
palm
of
the
boy
's
hand
.
<EOS>
The
Indian
 
first
touching
the
boy
's
head
,
and
making
signs
over
it
in
the
air
 
then
said
,
"
Look
.
"
<EOS>
The
boy
became
quite
stiff
,
and
stood
like
a
statue
,
looking
into
the
ink
in
the
hollow
of
his
hand
.
  
<EOS>
(
So
far
,
it
seemed
to
me
to
be
juggling
,
accompanied
by
a
foolish
waste
of
ink
.
<EOS>
I
was
beginning
to
feel
sleepy
again
,
when
Penelope
's
next
words
stirred
me
up
.
)
  
<EOS>
The
Indians
looked
up
the
road
and
down
the
road
once
more
 
<EOS>
and
then
the
chief
Indian
said
these
words
to
the
boy
;
<EOS>
"
See
the
English
gentleman
from
foreign
parts
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
boy
said
,
"
I
see
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
Indian
said
,
"
Is
it
on
the
road
to
this
house
,
and
on
no
other
,
that
the
English
gentleman
will
travel
to
-
day
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
boy
said
,
"
It
is
on
the
road
to
this
house
,
and
on
no
other
,
that
the
English
gentleman
will
travel
to
-
day
.
"
<EOS>
The
Indian
put
a
second
question
 
after
waiting
a
little
first
.
<EOS>
He
said
:
"
Has
the
English
gentleman
got
It
about
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
boy
answered
 
also
,
after
waiting
a
little
first
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
Indian
put
a
third
and
last
question
:
"
Will
the
English
gentleman
come
here
,
as
he
has
promised
to
come
,
at
the
close
of
day
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
boy
said
,
"
I
ca
n't
tell
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
Indian
asked
why
.
  
<EOS>
The
boy
said
,
"
I
am
tired
.
<EOS>
The
mist
rises
in
my
head
,
and
puzzles
me
.
<EOS>
I
can
see
no
more
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
With
that
the
catechism
ended
.
<EOS>
The
chief
Indian
said
something
in
his
own
language
to
the
other
two
,
pointing
to
the
boy
,
and
pointing
towards
the
town
,
in
which
(
as
we
afterwards
discovered
)
<EOS>
they
were
lodged
.
<EOS>
He
then
,
after
making
more
signs
on
the
boy
's
head
,
blew
on
his
forehead
,
and
so
woke
him
up
with
a
start
.
<EOS>
After
that
,
they
all
went
on
their
way
towards
the
town
,
and
the
girls
saw
them
no
more
.
  
<EOS>
Most
things
they
say
have
a
moral
,
if
you
only
look
for
it
.
<EOS>
What
was
the
moral
of
this
?
  
<EOS>
The
moral
was
,
as
I
thought
:
First
,
that
the
chief
juggler
had
heard
Mr.
Franklin
's
arrival
talked
of
among
the
servants
out
-
of
-
doors
,
and
saw
his
way
to
making
a
little
money
by
it
.
<EOS>
Second
,
that
he
and
his
men
and
boy
(
with
a
view
to
making
the
said
money
)
meant
to
hang
about
till
they
saw
my
lady
drive
home
,
and
then
to
come
back
,
and
foretell
Mr.
Franklin
's
arrival
by
magic
.
<EOS>
Third
,
that
Penelope
had
heard
them
rehearsing
their
hocus
-
pocus
,
like
actors
rehearsing
a
play
.
<EOS>
Fourth
,
that
I
should
do
well
to
have
an
eye
,
that
evening
,
on
the
plate
-
basket
.
<EOS>
Fifth
,
that
Penelope
would
do
well
to
cool
down
,
and
leave
me
,
her
father
,
to
doze
off
again
in
the
sun
.
  
<EOS>
That
appeared
to
me
to
be
the
sensible
view
.
<EOS>
If
you
know
anything
of
the
ways
of
young
women
,
you
wo
n't
be
surprised
to
hear
that
Penelope
would
n't
take
it
.
<EOS>
The
moral
of
the
thing
was
serious
,
according
to
my
daughter
.
<EOS>
She
particularly
reminded
me
of
the
Indian
's
third
question
,
Has
the
English
gentleman
got
It
about
him
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
father
!
"
says
Penelope
,
clasping
her
hands
,
"
do
n't
joke
about
this
.
<EOS>
What
does
"
It
'
mean
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
'll
ask
Mr.
Franklin
,
my
dear
,
"
I
said
,
"
if
you
can
wait
till
Mr.
Franklin
comes
.
<EOS>
"
I
winked
to
show
I
meant
that
in
joke
.
<EOS>
Penelope
took
it
quite
seriously
.
<EOS>
My
girl
's
earnestness
tickled
me
.
<EOS>
"
What
on
earth
should
Mr.
Franklin
know
about
it
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquired
.
<EOS>
"
Ask
him
,
"
says
Penelope
.
<EOS>
"
And
see
whether
HE
thinks
it
a
laughing
matter
,
too
.
"
<EOS>
With
that
parting
shot
,
my
daughter
left
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
settled
it
with
myself
,
when
she
was
gone
,
that
I
really
would
ask
Mr.
Franklin
 
mainly
to
set
Penelope
's
mind
at
rest
.
<EOS>
What
was
said
between
us
,
when
I
did
ask
him
,
later
on
that
same
day
,
you
will
find
set
out
fully
in
its
proper
place
.
<EOS>
But
as
I
do
n't
wish
to
raise
your
expectations
and
then
disappoint
them
,
I
will
take
leave
to
warn
you
here
 
before
we
go
any
further
 
that
you
wo
n't
find
the
ghost
of
a
joke
in
our
conversation
on
the
subject
of
the
jugglers
.
<EOS>
To
my
great
surprise
,
Mr.
Franklin
,
like
Penelope
,
took
the
thing
seriously
.
<EOS>
How
seriously
,
you
will
understand
,
when
I
tell
you
that
,
in
his
opinion
,
"
It
"
meant
the
Moonstone
.
    
<EOS>
I
am
truly
sorry
to
detain
you
over
me
and
my
beehive
chair
.
<EOS>
A
sleepy
old
man
,
in
a
sunny
back
yard
,
is
not
an
interesting
object
,
I
am
well
aware
.
<EOS>
But
things
must
be
put
down
in
their
places
,
as
things
actually
happened
 
and
you
must
please
to
jog
on
a
little
while
longer
with
me
,
in
expectation
of
Mr.
Franklin
Blake
's
arrival
later
in
the
day
.
  
<EOS>
Before
I
had
time
to
doze
off
again
,
after
my
daughter
Penelope
had
left
me
,
I
was
disturbed
by
a
rattling
of
plates
and
dishes
in
the
servants
'
hall
,
which
meant
that
dinner
was
ready
.
<EOS>
Taking
my
own
meals
in
my
own
sitting
-
room
,
I
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
servants
'
dinner
,
except
to
wish
them
a
good
stomach
to
it
all
round
,
previous
to
composing
myself
once
more
in
my
chair
.
<EOS>
I
was
just
stretching
my
legs
,
when
out
bounced
another
woman
on
me
.
<EOS>
Not
my
daughter
again
;
only
Nancy
,
the
kitchen
-
maid
,
this
time
.
<EOS>
I
was
straight
in
her
way
out
;
and
I
observed
,
as
she
asked
me
to
let
her
by
,
that
she
had
a
sulky
face
 
a
thing
which
,
as
head
of
the
servants
,
I
never
allow
,
on
principle
,
to
pass
me
without
inquiry
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
are
you
turning
your
back
on
your
dinner
for
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
<EOS>
"
What
's
wrong
now
,
Nancy
?
"
  
Nancy
tried
to
push
by
,
without
answering
;
upon
which
I
rose
up
,
and
took
her
by
the
ear
.
<EOS>
She
is
a
nice
plump
young
lass
,
and
it
is
customary
with
me
to
adopt
that
manner
of
showing
that
I
personally
approve
of
a
girl
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
's
wrong
now
?
<EOS>
"
I
said
once
more
.
  
<EOS>
"
Rosanna
's
late
again
for
dinner
,
"
says
Nancy
.
<EOS>
"
And
I
'm
sent
to
fetch
her
in
.
<EOS>
All
the
hard
work
falls
on
my
shoulders
in
this
house
.
<EOS>
Let
me
alone
,
Mr.
Betteredge
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
person
here
mentioned
as
Rosanna
was
our
second
housemaid
.
<EOS>
Having
a
kind
of
pity
for
our
second
housemaid
(
why
,
you
shall
presently
know
)
,
and
seeing
in
Nancy
's
face
,
that
she
would
fetch
her
fellow
-
servant
in
with
more
hard
words
than
might
be
needful
under
the
circumstances
,
it
struck
me
that
I
had
nothing
particular
to
do
,
and
that
I
might
as
well
fetch
Rosanna
myself
;
giving
her
a
hint
to
be
punctual
in
future
,
which
I
knew
she
would
take
kindly
from
ME
.
  
<EOS>
"
Where
is
Rosanna
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquired
.
  
<EOS>
"
At
the
sands
,
of
course
!
"
says
Nancy
,
with
a
toss
of
her
head
.
<EOS>
"
She
had
another
of
her
fainting
fits
this
morning
,
and
she
asked
to
go
out
and
get
a
breath
of
fresh
air
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
patience
with
her
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Go
back
to
your
dinner
,
my
girl
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
patience
with
her
,
and
I
'll
fetch
her
in
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Nancy
(
who
has
a
fine
appetite
)
looked
pleased
.
<EOS>
When
she
looks
pleased
,
she
looks
nice
.
<EOS>
When
she
looks
nice
,
I
chuck
her
under
the
chin
.
<EOS>
It
is
n't
immorality
 
<EOS>
it
's
only
habit
.
  
<EOS>
Well
,
I
took
my
stick
,
and
set
off
for
the
sands
.
  
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
it
wo
n't
do
to
set
off
yet
.
<EOS>
I
am
sorry
again
to
detain
you
;
but
you
really
must
hear
the
story
of
the
sands
,
and
the
story
of
Rosanna
 
for
this
reason
,
that
the
matter
of
the
Diamond
touches
them
both
nearly
.
<EOS>
How
hard
I
try
to
get
on
with
my
statement
without
stopping
by
the
way
,
and
how
badly
I
succeed
!
<EOS>
But
,
there
!

and
Things
do
turn
up
so
vexatiously
in
this
life
,
and
will
in
a
manner
insist
on
being
noticed
.
<EOS>
Let
us
take
it
easy
,
and
let
us
take
it
short
;
we
shall
be
in
the
thick
of
the
mystery
soon
,
I
promise
you
!
  
<EOS>
Rosanna
(
to
put
the
Person
before
the
Thing
,
which
is
but
common
politeness
)
was
the
only
new
servant
in
our
house
.
<EOS>
About
four
months
before
the
time
I
am
writing
of
,
my
lady
had
been
in
London
,
and
had
gone
over
a
Reformatory
,
intended
to
save
forlorn
women
from
drifting
back
into
bad
ways
,
after
they
had
got
released
from
prison
.
<EOS>
The
matron
,
seeing
my
lady
took
an
interest
in
the
place
,
pointed
out
a
girl
to
her
,
named
Rosanna
Spearman
,
and
told
her
a
most
miserable
story
,
which
I
have
n't
the
heart
to
repeat
here
;
for
I
do
n't
like
to
be
made
wretched
without
any
use
,
and
no
more
do
you
.
<EOS>
The
upshot
of
it
was
,
that
Rosanna
Spearman
had
been
a
thief
,
and
not
being
of
the
sort
that
get
up
Companies
in
the
City
,
and
rob
from
thousands
,
instead
of
only
robbing
from
one
,
the
law
laid
hold
of
her
,
and
the
prison
and
the
reformatory
followed
the
lead
of
the
law
.
<EOS>
The
matron
's
opinion
of
Rosanna
was
(
in
spite
of
what
she
had
done
)
that
the
girl
was
one
in
a
thousand
,
and
that
she
only
wanted
a
chance
to
prove
herself
worthy
of
any
Christian
woman
's
interest
in
her
.
<EOS>
My
lady
(
being
a
Christian
woman
,
if
ever
there
was
one
yet
)
said
to
the
matron
,
upon
that
,
"
Rosanna
Spearman
shall
have
her
chance
,
in
my
service
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
In
a
week
afterwards
,
Rosanna
Spearman
entered
this
establishment
as
our
second
housemaid
.
  
<EOS>
Not
a
soul
was
told
the
girl
's
story
,
excepting
Miss
Rachel
and
me
.
<EOS>
My
lady
,
doing
me
the
honour
to
consult
me
about
most
things
,
consulted
me
about
Rosanna
.
<EOS>
Having
fallen
a
good
deal
latterly
into
the
late
Sir
John
's
way
of
always
agreeing
with
my
lady
,
I
agreed
with
her
heartily
about
Rosanna
Spearman
.
  
<EOS>
A
fairer
chance
no
girl
could
have
had
than
was
given
to
this
poor
girl
of
ours
.
<EOS>
None
of
the
servants
could
cast
her
past
life
in
her
teeth
,
for
none
of
the
servants
knew
what
it
had
been
.
<EOS>
She
had
her
wages
and
her
privileges
,
like
the
rest
of
them
;
and
every
now
<EOS>
and
then
a
friendly
word
from
my
lady
,
in
private
,
to
encourage
her
.
<EOS>
In
return
,
she
showed
herself
,
I
am
bound
to
say
,
well
worthy
of
the
kind
treatment
bestowed
upon
her
.
<EOS>
Though
far
from
strong
,
and
troubled
occasionally
with
those
fainting
-
fits
already
mentioned
,
she
went
about
her
work
modestly
and
uncomplainingly
,
doing
it
carefully
,
and
doing
it
well
.
<EOS>
But
,
somehow
,
she
failed
to
make
friends
among
the
other
women
servants
,
excepting
my
daughter
Penelope
,
who
was
always
kind
to
Rosanna
,
though
never
intimate
with
her
.
  
<EOS>
I
hardly
know
what
the
girl
did
to
offend
them
.
<EOS>
There
was
certainly
no
beauty
about
her
to
make
the
others
envious
;
she
was
the
plainest
woman
in
the
house
,
with
the
additional
misfortune
of
having
one
shoulder
bigger
than
the
other
.
<EOS>
What
the
servants
chiefly
resented
,
I
think
,
was
her
silent
tongue
and
her
solitary
ways
.
<EOS>
She
read
or
worked
in
leisure
hours
when
the
rest
gossiped
.
<EOS>
And
when
it
came
to
her
turn
to
go
out
,
nine
times
out
of
ten
she
quietly
put
on
her
bonnet
,
and
had
her
turn
by
herself
.
<EOS>
She
never
quarrelled
,
she
never
took
offence
;
she
only
kept
a
certain
distance
,
obstinately
and
civilly
,
between
the
rest
of
them
and
herself
.
<EOS>
Add
to
this
that
,
plain
as
she
was
,
there
was
just
a
dash
of
something
that
was
n't
like
a
housemaid
,
and
that
WAS
like
a
lady
,
about
her
.
<EOS>
It
might
have
been
in
her
voice
,
or
it
might
have
been
in
her
face
.
<EOS>
All
I
can
say
is
,
that
the
other
women
pounced
on
it
like
lightning
the
first
day
she
came
into
the
house
,
and
said
(
which
was
most
unjust
)
that
Rosanna
Spearman
gave
herself
airs
.
  
<EOS>
Having
now
told
the
story
of
Rosanna
,
I
have
only
to
notice
one
of
the
many
queer
ways
of
this
strange
girl
to
get
on
next
to
the
story
of
the
sands
.
  
<EOS>
Our
house
is
high
up
on
the
Yorkshire
coast
,
and
close
by
the
sea
.
<EOS>
We
have
got
beautiful
walks
all
round
us
,
in
every
direction
but
one
.
<EOS>
That
one
I
acknowledge
to
be
a
horrid
walk
.
<EOS>
It
leads
,
for
a
quarter
of
a
mile
,
through
a
melancholy
plantation
of
firs
,
and
brings
you
out
between
low
cliffs
on
the
loneliest
and
ugliest
little
bay
on
all
our
coast
.
  
<EOS>
The
sand
-
hills
here
run
down
to
the
sea
,
and
end
in
two
spits
of
rock
jutting
out
opposite
each
other
,
till
you
lose
sight
of
them
in
the
water
.
<EOS>
One
is
called
the
North
Spit
,
and
one
the
South
.
<EOS>
Between
the
two
,
shifting
backwards
and
forwards
at
certain
seasons
of
the
year
,
lies
the
most
horrible
quicksand
on
the
shores
of
Yorkshire
.
<EOS>
At
the
turn
of
the
tide
,
something
goes
on
in
the
unknown
deeps
below
,
which
sets
the
whole
face
of
the
quicksand
shivering
and
trembling
in
a
manner
most
remarkable
to
see
,
and
which
has
given
to
it
,
among
the
people
in
our
parts
,
the
name
of
the
Shivering
Sand
.
<EOS>
A
great
bank
,
half
a
mile
out
,
nigh
the
mouth
of
the
bay
,
breaks
the
force
of
the
main
ocean
coming
in
from
the
offing
.
<EOS>
Winter
and
summer
,
when
the
tide
flows
over
the
quicksand
,
the
sea
seems
to
leave
the
waves
behind
it
on
the
bank
,
and
rolls
its
waters
in
smoothly
with
a
heave
,
and
covers
the
sand
in
silence
.
<EOS>
A
lonesome
and
a
horrid
retreat
,
I
can
tell
you
!
<EOS>
No
boat
ever
ventures
into
this
bay
.
<EOS>
No
children
from
our
fishing
-
village
,
called
Cobb
's
Hole
,
ever
come
here
to
play
.
<EOS>
The
very
birds
of
the
air
,
as
it
seems
to
me
,
give
the
Shivering
Sand
a
wide
berth
.
<EOS>
That
a
young
woman
,
with
dozens
of
nice
walks
to
choose
from
,
and
company
to
go
with
her
,
if
she
only
said
"
Come
!
"
should
prefer
this
place
,
and
should
sit
and
work
or
read
in
it
,
all
alone
,
when
it
's
her
turn
out
<EOS>
,
I
grant
you
,
passes
belief
.
<EOS>
It
's
true
,
nevertheless
,
account
for
it
as
you
may
,
that
this
was
Rosanna
Spearman
's
favourite
walk
,
except
when
she
went
once
or
twice
to
Cobb
's
Hole
,
to
see
the
only
friend
she
had
in
our
neighbourhood
,
of
whom
more
anon
.
<EOS>
It
's
also
true
that
I
was
now
setting
out
for
this
same
place
,
to
fetch
the
girl
in
to
dinner
,
which
brings
us
round
happily
to
our
former
point
,
and
starts
us
fair
again
on
our
way
to
the
sands
.
  
<EOS>
I
saw
no
sign
of
the
girl
in
the
plantation
.
<EOS>
When
I
got
out
,
through
the
sand
-
hills
,
on
to
the
beach
,
there
she
was
,
in
her
little
straw
bonnet
,
and
her
plain
grey
cloak
that
she
always
wore
to
hide
her
deformed
shoulder
as
much
as
might
be
 
there
<EOS>
she
was
,
all
alone
,
looking
out
on
the
quicksand
and
the
sea
.
  
<EOS>
She
started
when
I
came
up
with
her
,
and
turned
her
head
away
from
me
.
<EOS>
Not
looking
me
in
the
face
being
another
of
the
proceedings
,
which
,
as
head
of
the
servants
,
I
never
allow
,
on
principle
,
to
pass
without
inquiry
 
<EOS>
I
turned
her
round
my
way
,
and
saw
that
she
was
crying
.
<EOS>
My
bandanna
handkerchief
 
one
of
six
beauties
given
to
me
by
my
lady
 
was
handy
in
my
pocket
.
<EOS>
I
took
it
out
,
and
I
said
to
Rosanna
,
"
Come
and
sit
down
,
my
dear
,
on
the
slope
of
the
beach
along
with
me
.
<EOS>
I
'll
dry
your
eyes
for
you
first
,
and
then
I
'll
make
so
bold
as
to
ask
what
you
have
been
crying
about
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
When
you
come
to
my
age
,
you
will
find
sitting
down
on
the
slope
of
a
beach
a
much
longer
job
than
you
think
it
now
.
<EOS>
By
the
time
I
was
settled
,
Rosanna
had
dried
her
own
eyes
with
a
very
inferior
handkerchief
to
mine
 
cheap
cambric
.
<EOS>
She
looked
very
quiet
,
and
very
wretched
;
but
she
sat
down
by
me
like
a
good
girl
,
when
I
told
her
.
<EOS>
When
you
want
to
comfort
a
woman
by
the
shortest
way
,
take
her
on
your
knee
.
<EOS>
I
thought
of
this
golden
rule
.
<EOS>
But
there
!
<EOS>
Rosanna
was
n't
Nancy
,
and
that
's
the
truth
of
it
!
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
tell
me
,
my
dear
,
"
I
said
,
"
what
are
you
crying
about
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
About
the
years
that
are
gone
,
Mr.
Betteredge
,
"
says
Rosanna
quietly
.
<EOS>
"
My
past
life
still
comes
back
to
me
sometimes
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Come
,
come
,
my
girl
,
"
I
said
,
"
your
past
life
is
all
sponged
out
.
<EOS>
Why
ca
n't
you
forget
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
took
me
by
one
of
the
lappets
of
my
coat
.
<EOS>
I
am
a
slovenly
old
man
,
and
a
good
deal
of
my
meat
and
drink
gets
splashed
about
on
my
clothes
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
one
of
the
women
,
and
sometimes
another
,
cleans
me
of
my
grease
.
<EOS>
The
day
before
,
Rosanna
had
taken
out
a
spot
for
me
on
the
lappet
of
my
coat
,
with
a
new
composition
,
warranted
to
remove
anything
.
<EOS>
The
grease
was
gone
,
but
there
was
a
little
dull
place
left
on
the
nap
of
the
cloth
where
the
grease
had
been
.
<EOS>
The
girl
pointed
to
that
place
,
and
shook
her
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
stain
is
taken
off
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
But
the
place
shows
,
Mr.
Betteredge
 
<EOS>
the
place
shows
!
"
  
<EOS>
A
remark
which
takes
a
man
unawares
by
means
of
his
own
coat
is
not
an
easy
remark
to
answer
.
<EOS>
Something
in
the
girl
herself
,
too
,
made
me
particularly
sorry
for
her
just
then
.
<EOS>
She
had
nice
brown
eyes
,
plain
as
she
was
in
other
ways
 
<EOS>
and
she
looked
at
me
with
a
sort
of
respect
for
my
happy
old
age
and
my
good
character
,
as
things
for
ever
out
of
her
own
reach
,
which
made
my
heart
heavy
for
our
second
housemaid
.
<EOS>
Not
feeling
myself
able
to
comfort
her
,
there
was
only
one
other
thing
to
do
.
<EOS>
That
thing
was
 
to
take
her
in
to
dinner
.
  
<EOS>
"
Help
me
up
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
You
're
late
for
dinner
,
Rosanna
 
<EOS>
and
I
have
come
to
fetch
you
in
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
,
Mr.
Betteredge
!
"
says
she
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
told
Nancy
to
fetch
you
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
But
thought
you
might
like
your
scolding
better
,
my
dear
,
if
it
came
from
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Instead
of
helping
me
up
,
the
poor
thing
stole
her
hand
into
mine
,
and
gave
it
a
little
squeeze
.
<EOS>
She
tried
hard
to
keep
from
crying
again
,
and
succeeded
 
for
which
I
respected
her
.
<EOS>
"
You
're
very
kind
,
Mr.
Betteredge
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
want
any
dinner
to
-
day
 
let
me
bide
a
little
longer
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
makes
you
like
to
be
here
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
<EOS>
"
What
is
it
that
brings
you
everlastingly
to
this
miserable
place
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Something
draws
me
to
it
,
"
says
the
girl
,
making
images
with
her
finger
in
the
sand
.
<EOS>
"
I
try
to
keep
away
from
it
,
and
I
ca
n't
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
,
"
says
she
in
a
low
voice
,
as
if
she
was
frightened
at
her
own
fancy
,
"
sometimes
,
Mr.
Betteredge
,
I
think
that
my
grave
is
waiting
for
me
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
roast
mutton
and
suet
-
pudding
waiting
for
you
!
"
says
I.
"
Go
in
to
dinner
directly
.
<EOS>
This
is
what
comes
,
Rosanna
,
of
thinking
on
an
empty
stomach
!
<EOS>
"
I
spoke
severely
,
being
naturally
indignant
(
at
my
time
of
life
)
to
hear
a
young
woman
of
five
-
and
-
twenty
talking
about
her
latter
end
!
  
<EOS>
She
did
n't
seem
to
hear
me
:
she
put
her
hand
on
my
shoulder
,
and
kept
me
where
I
was
,
sitting
by
her
side
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
the
place
has
laid
a
spell
on
me
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
dream
of
it
night
after
night
;
I
think
of
it
when
I
sit
stitching
at
my
work
.
<EOS>
You
know
I
am
grateful
,
Mr.
Betteredge
 
<EOS>
you
know
I
try
to
deserve
your
kindness
,
and
my
lady
's
confidence
in
me
.
<EOS>
But
I
wonder
sometimes
whether
the
life
here
is
too
quiet
and
too
good
for
such
a
woman
as
I
am
,
after
all
I
have
gone
through
,
Mr.
Betteredge
 
after
all
I
have
gone
through
.
<EOS>
It
's
more
lonely
to
me
to
be
among
the
other
servants
,
knowing
I
am
not
what
they
are
,
than
it
is
to
be
here
.
<EOS>
My
lady
does
n't
know
,
the
matron
at
the
reformatory
does
n't
know
,
what
a
dreadful
reproach
honest
people
are
in
themselves
to
a
woman
like
me
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
scold
me
,
there
's
a
dear
good
man
.
<EOS>
I
do
my
work
,
do
n't
I
?
<EOS>
Please
not
to
tell
my
lady
I
am
discontented
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
.
<EOS>
My
mind
's
unquiet
,
sometimes
,
that
's
all
.
"
<EOS>
She
snatched
her
hand
off
my
shoulder
,
and
suddenly
pointed
down
to
the
quicksand
.
"
<EOS>
Look
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
"
Is
n't
it
wonderful
?
<EOS>
is
n't
it
terrible
?
<EOS>
I
have
seen
it
dozens
of
times
,
and
it
's
always
as
new
to
me
as
if
I
had
never
seen
it
before
!
"
  
<EOS>
I
looked
where
she
pointed
.
<EOS>
The
tide
was
on
the
turn
,
and
the
horrid
sand
began
to
shiver
.
<EOS>
The
broad
brown
face
of
it
heaved
slowly
,
and
then
dimpled
and
quivered
all
over
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Do
you
know
what
it
looks
like
to
ME
?
"
says
Rosanna
,
catching
me
by
the
shoulder
again
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
It
looks
as
if
it
had
hundreds
of
suffocating
people
under
it
 
all
struggling
to
get
to
the
surface
,
and
all
sinking
lower
and
lower
in
the
dreadful
deeps
!
<EOS>
Throw
a
stone
in
,
Mr.
Betteredge
!
<EOS>
Throw
a
stone
in
,
and
let
's
see
the
sand
suck
it
down
!
"
  
<EOS>
Here
was
unwholesome
talk
!
<EOS>
Here
was
an
empty
stomach
feeding
on
an
unquiet
mind
!
<EOS>
My
answer
 
a
pretty
sharp
one
,
in
the
poor
girl
's
own
interests
,
I
promise
you
!
 
<EOS>
was
at
my
tongue
's
end
,
when
it
was
snapped
short
off
on
a
sudden
by
a
voice
among
the
sand
-
hills
shouting
for
me
by
my
name
.
<EOS>
"
Betteredge
!
"
<EOS>
cries
the
voice
,
"
<EOS>
where
are
you
?
"
<EOS>
"
Here
!
<EOS>
"
I
shouted
out
in
return
,
without
a
notion
in
my
mind
of
who
it
was
.
<EOS>
Rosanna
started
to
her
feet
,
and
stood
looking
towards
the
voice
.
<EOS>
I
was
just
thinking
of
getting
on
my
own
legs
next
,
when
I
was
staggered
by
a
sudden
change
in
the
girl
's
face
.
  
<EOS>
Her
complexion
turned
of
a
beautiful
red
,
which
I
had
never
seen
in
it
before
;
she
brightened
all
over
with
a
kind
of
speechless
and
breathless
surprise
.
<EOS>
"
Who
is
it
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
<EOS>
Rosanna
gave
me
back
my
own
question
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
who
is
it
?
"
<EOS>
she
said
softly
,
more
to
herself
than
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
twisted
round
on
the
sand
and
looked
behind
me
.
<EOS>
There
,
coming
out
on
us
from
among
the
hills
,
was
a
bright
-
eyed
young
gentleman
,
dressed
in
a
beautiful
fawn
-
coloured
suit
,
with
gloves
and
hat
to
match
,
with
a
rose
in
his
button
-
hole
,
and
a
smile
on
his
face
that
might
have
set
the
Shivering
Sand
itself
smiling
at
him
in
return
.
<EOS>
Before
I
could
get
on
my
legs
,
he
plumped
down
on
the
sand
by
the
side
of
me
,
put
his
arm
<EOS>
round
my
neck
,
foreign
fashion
,
and
gave
me
a
hug
that
fairly
squeezed
the
breath
out
of
my
body
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Dear
old
Betteredge
!
"
says
he
.
<EOS>
"
I
owe
you
seven
-
and
-
sixpence
.
<EOS>
Now
do
you
know
who
I
am
?
"
  
<EOS>
Lord
bless
us
and
save
us
!
<EOS>
Here
 
four
good
hours
before
we
expected
him
 
was
Mr.
Franklin
Blake
!
  
<EOS>
Before
I
could
say
a
word
,
I
saw
Mr.
Franklin
,
a
little
surprised
to
all
appearance
,
look
up
from
me
to
Rosanna
.
<EOS>
Following
his
lead
,
I
looked
at
the
girl
too
.
<EOS>
She
was
blushing
of
a
deeper
red
than
ever
,
seemingly
at
having
caught
Mr.
Franklin
's
eye
;
and
she
turned
and
left
us
suddenly
,
in
a
confusion
quite
unaccountable
to
my
mind
,
without
either
making
her
curtsey
to
the
gentleman
or
saying
a
word
to
me
.
<EOS>
Very
unlike
her
usual
self
:
a
civiller
and
better
-
behaved
servant
,
in
general
,
you
never
met
with
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
an
odd
girl
,
"
says
Mr.
Franklin
.
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
what
she
sees
in
me
to
surprise
her
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
,
sir
,
"
I
answered
,
drolling
on
our
young
gentleman
's
Continental
education
,
"
it
's
the
varnish
from
foreign
parts
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
set
down
here
Mr.
Franklin
's
careless
question
,
and
my
foolish
answer
,
as
a
consolation
and
encouragement
to
all
stupid
people
 
<EOS>
it
being
,
as
I
have
remarked
,
a
great
satisfaction
to
our
inferior
fellow
-
creatures
to
find
that
their
betters
are
,
on
occasions
,
no
brighter
than
they
are
.
<EOS>
Neither
Mr.
Franklin
,
with
his
wonderful
foreign
training
,
nor
I
,
with
my
age
,
experience
,
and
natural
mother
-
wit
,
had
the
ghost
of
an
idea
of
what
Rosanna
Spearman
's
unaccountable
behaviour
really
meant
.
<EOS>
She
was
out
of
our
thoughts
,
poor
soul
,
before
we
had
seen
the
last
flutter
of
her
little
grey
cloak
among
the
sand
-
hills
.
<EOS>
And
what
of
that
?
<EOS>
you
will
ask
,
naturally
enough
.
<EOS>
Read
on
,
good
friend
,
as
patiently
as
you
can
,
and
perhaps
you
will
be
as
sorry
for
Rosanna
Spearman
as
I
was
,
when
I
found
out
the
truth
.
    
<EOS>
The
first
thing
I
did
,
after
we
were
left
together
alone
,
was
to
make
a
third
attempt
to
get
up
from
my
seat
on
the
sand
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Franklin
stopped
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
one
advantage
about
this
horrid
place
,
"
he
said
;
"
we
have
got
it
all
to
ourselves
.
<EOS>
Stay
where
you
are
,
Betteredge
;
I
have
something
to
say
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
While
he
was
speaking
,
I
was
looking
at
him
,
and
trying
to
see
something
of
the
boy
I
remembered
,
in
the
man
before
me
.
<EOS>
The
man
put
me
out
.
<EOS>
Look
as
I
might
,
I
could
see
no
more
of
his
boy
's
rosy
cheeks
than
of
his
boy
's
trim
little
jacket
.
<EOS>
His
complexion
had
got
pale
:
his
face
,
at
the
lower
part
was
covered
,
to
my
great
surprise
and
disappointment
,
with
a
curly
brown
beard
and
mustachios
.
<EOS>
He
had
a
lively
touch
-
and
-
go
way
with
him
,
very
pleasant
and
engaging
,
I
admit
;
but
nothing
to
compare
with
his
free
-
and
-
easy
manners
of
other
times
.
<EOS>
To
make
matters
worse
,
he
had
promised
to
be
tall
,
and
had
not
kept
his
promise
.
<EOS>
He
was
neat
,
and
slim
,
and
well
made
;
but
he
was
n't
by
an
inch
or
two
up
to
the
middle
height
.
<EOS>
In
short
,
he
baffled
me
altogether
.
<EOS>
The
years
that
had
passed
had
left
nothing
of
his
old
self
,
except
the
bright
,
straightforward
look
in
his
eyes
.
<EOS>
There
I
found
our
nice
boy
again
,
and
there
I
concluded
to
stop
in
my
investigation
.
  
<EOS>
"
Welcome
back
to
the
old
place
,
Mr.
Franklin
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
All
the
more
welcome
,
sir
,
that
you
have
come
some
hours
before
we
expected
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
a
reason
for
coming
before
you
expected
me
,
"
answered
Mr.
Franklin
.
<EOS>
"
I
suspect
,
Betteredge
,
that
I
have
been
followed
and
watched
in
London
,
for
the
last
three
or
four
days
;
and
I
have
travelled
by
the
morning
instead
of
the
afternoon
train
,
because
I
wanted
to
give
a
certain
dark
-
looking
stranger
the
slip
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Those
words
did
more
than
surprise
me
.
<EOS>
They
brought
back
to
my
mind
,
in
a
flash
,
the
three
jugglers
,
and
Penelope
's
notion
that
they
meant
some
mischief
to
Mr.
Franklin
Blake
.
  
<EOS>
"
Who
's
watching
you
,
sir
,
 
and
why
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquired
.
  
<EOS>
"
Tell
me
about
the
three
Indians
you
have
had
at
the
house
to
-
day
,
"
says
Mr.
Franklin
,
without
noticing
my
question
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
just
possible
,
Betteredge
,
that
my
stranger
and
your
three
jugglers
may
turn
out
to
be
pieces
of
the
same
puzzle
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
come
to
know
about
the
jugglers
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
,
putting
one
question
on
the
top
of
another
,
which
was
bad
manners
,
I
own
.
<EOS>
But
you
do
n't
expect
much
from
poor
human
nature
 
<EOS>
so
do
n't
expect
much
from
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
saw
Penelope
at
the
house
,
"
says
Mr.
Franklin
;
"
and
Penelope
told
me
.
<EOS>
Your
daughter
promised
to
be
a
pretty
girl
,
Betteredge
,
and
she
has
kept
her
promise
.
<EOS>
Penelope
has
got
a
small
ear
and
a
small
foot
.
<EOS>
Did
the
late
Mrs.
Betteredge
possess
those
inestimable
advantages
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
late
Mrs.
Betteredge
possessed
a
good
many
defects
,
sir
,
"
says
I.
"
One
of
them
(
if
you
will
pardon
my
mentioning
it
)
was
never
keeping
to
the
matter
in
hand
.
<EOS>
She
was
more
like
a
fly
than
a
woman
:
she
could
n't
settle
on
anything
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
would
just
have
suited
me
,
"
says
Mr.
Franklin
.
<EOS>
"
I
never
settle
on
anything
either
.
<EOS>
Betteredge
,
your
edge
is
better
than
ever
.
<EOS>
Your
daughter
said
as
much
,
when
I
asked
for
particulars
about
the
jugglers
.
"
<EOS>
Father
will
tell
you
,
sir
.
<EOS>
He
's
a
wonderful
man
for
his
age
;
and
he
expresses
himself
beautifully
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Penelope
's
own
words
 
blushing
divinely
.
<EOS>
Not
even
my
respect
for
you
prevented
me
from
 
never
mind
;
I
knew
her
when
she
was
a
child
,
and
she
's
none
the
worse
for
it
.
<EOS>
Let
's
be
serious
.
<EOS>
What
did
the
jugglers
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
was
something
dissatisfied
with
my
daughter
 
not
for
letting
Mr.
Franklin
kiss
her
;
Mr.
Franklin
was
welcome
to
THAT
 
but
for
forcing
me
to
tell
her
foolish
story
at
second
hand
.
<EOS>
However
,
there
was
no
help
for
it
now
but
to
mention
the
circumstances
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Franklin
's
merriment
all
died
away
as
I
went
on
.
<EOS>
He
sat
knitting
his
eyebrows
,
and
twisting
his
beard
.
<EOS>
When
I
had
done
,
he
repeated
after
me
two
of
the
questions
which
the
chief
juggler
had
put
to
the
boy
 
seemingly
for
the
purpose
of
fixing
them
well
in
his
mind
.
  
<EOS>
"
"
Is
it
on
the
road
to
this
house
,
and
on
no
other
,
that
the
English
gentleman
will
travel
to
-
day
?
"
<EOS>
"
Has
the
English
gentleman
got
It
about
him
?
<EOS>
"
I
suspect
,
"
says
Mr.
Franklin
,
pulling
a
little
sealed
paper
parcel
out
of
his
pocket
,
"
that
"
It
'
means
THIS
.
<EOS>
And
"
this
,
"
Betteredge
,
means
my
uncle
Herncastle
's
famous
Diamond
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Good
Lord
,
sir
!
<EOS>
"
I
broke
out
,
"
how
do
you
come
to
be
in
charge
of
the
wicked
Colonel
's
Diamond
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
wicked
Colonel
's
will
has
left
his
Diamond
as
a
birthday
present
to
my
cousin
Rachel
,
"
says
Mr.
Franklin
.
<EOS>
"
And
my
father
,
as
the
wicked
Colonel
's
executor
,
has
given
it
in
charge
to
me
to
bring
down
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
If
the
sea
,
then
oozing
in
smoothly
over
the
Shivering
Sand
,
had
been
changed
into
dry
land
before
my
own
eyes
,
I
doubt
if
I
could
have
been
more
surprised
than
I
was
when
Mr.
Franklin
spoke
those
words
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
Colonel
's
Diamond
left
to
Miss
Rachel
!
"
says
I.
"
<EOS>
And
your
father
,
sir
,
the
Colonel
's
executor
!
<EOS>
Why
,
I
would
have
laid
any
bet
you
like
,
Mr.
Franklin
,
that
your
father
would
n't
have
touched
the
Colonel
with
a
pair
of
tongs
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Strong
language
,
Betteredge
!
<EOS>
What
was
there
against
the
Colonel
.
<EOS>
He
belonged
to
your
time
,
not
to
mine
.
<EOS>
Tell
me
what
you
know
about
him
,
and
I
'll
tell
you
how
my
father
came
to
be
his
executor
,
and
more
besides
.
<EOS>
I
have
made
some
discoveries
in
London
about
my
uncle
Herncastle
and
his
Diamond
,
which
have
rather
an
ugly
look
to
my
eyes
;
and
I
want
you
to
confirm
them
.
<EOS>
You
called
him
the
"
wicked
Colonel
"
just
now
.
<EOS>
Search
your
memory
,
my
old
friend
,
and
tell
me
why
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
saw
he
was
in
earnest
,
and
I
told
him
.
  
<EOS>
Here
follows
the
substance
of
what
I
said
,
written
out
entirely
for
your
benefit
.
<EOS>
Pay
attention
to
it
,
or
you
will
be
all
abroad
,
when
we
get
deeper
into
the
story
.
<EOS>
Clear
your
mind
of
the
children
,
or
the
dinner
,
or
the
new
bonnet
,
or
what
not
.
<EOS>
Try
if
you
ca
n't
forget
politics
,
horses
,
prices
in
the
City
,
and
grievances
at
the
club
.
<EOS>
I
hope
you
wo
n't
take
this
freedom
on
my
part
amiss
;
it
's
only
a
way
I
have
of
appealing
to
the
gentle
reader
.
<EOS>
Lord
!
<EOS>
have
n't
I
seen
you
with
the
greatest
authors
in
your
hands
,
and
do
n't
I
know
how
ready
your
attention
is
to
wander
when
it
's
a
book
that
asks
for
it
,
instead
of
a
person
?
  
<EOS>
I
spoke
,
a
little
way
back
,
of
my
lady
's
father
,
the
old
lord
with
the
short
temper
and
the
long
tongue
.
<EOS>
He
had
five
children
in
all
.
<EOS>
Two
sons
to
begin
with
;
then
,
after
a
long
time
,
his
wife
broke
out
breeding
again
,
and
the
three
young
ladies
came
briskly
one
after
the
other
,
as
fast
as
the
nature
of
things
would
permit
;
my
mistress
,
as
before
mentioned
,
being
the
youngest
and
best
of
the
three
.
<EOS>
Of
the
two
sons
,
the
eldest
,
Arthur
,
inherited
the
title
and
estates
.
<EOS>
The
second
,
the
Honourable
John
,
got
a
fine
fortune
left
him
by
a
relative
,
and
went
into
the
army
.
  
<EOS>
It
's
an
ill
bird
,
they
say
,
that
fouls
its
own
nest
.
<EOS>
I
look
on
the
noble
family
of
the
Herncastles
as
being
my
nest
;
and
I
shall
take
it
as
a
favour
if
I
am
not
expected
to
enter
into
particulars
on
the
subject
of
the
Honourable
John
.
<EOS>
He
was
,
I
honestly
believe
,
one
of
the
greatest
blackguards
that
ever
lived
.
<EOS>
I
can
hardly
say
more
or
less
for
him
than
that
.
<EOS>
He
went
into
the
army
,
beginning
in
the
Guards
.
<EOS>
He
had
to
leave
the
Guards
before
he
was
two
-
and
-
twenty
 
<EOS>
never
mind
why
.
<EOS>
They
are
very
strict
in
the
army
,
and
they
were
too
strict
for
the
Honourable
John
.
<EOS>
He
went
out
to
India
to
see
whether
they
were
equally
strict
there
,
and
to
try
a
little
active
service
.
<EOS>
In
the
matter
of
bravery
(
to
give
him
his
due
)
,
he
was
a
mixture
of
bull
-
dog
and
game
-
cock
,
with
a
dash
of
the
savage
.
<EOS>
He
was
at
the
taking
of
Seringapatam
.
<EOS>
Soon
afterwards
he
changed
into
another
regiment
,
and
,
in
course
of
time
,
changed
into
a
third
.
<EOS>
In
the
third
he
got
his
last
step
as
lieutenant
-
colonel
,
and
,
getting
that
,
got
also
a
sunstroke
,
and
came
home
to
England
.
  
<EOS>
He
came
back
with
a
character
that
closed
the
doors
of
all
his
family
against
him
,
my
lady
(
then
just
married
)
taking
the
lead
,
and
declaring
(
with
Sir
John
's
approval
,
of
course
)
that
her
brother
should
never
enter
any
house
of
hers
.
<EOS>
There
was
more
than
one
slur
on
the
Colonel
that
made
people
shy
of
him
;
but
the
blot
of
the
Diamond
is
all
I
need
mention
here
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
said
he
had
got
possession
of
his
Indian
jewel
by
means
which
,
bold
as
he
was
,
he
did
n't
dare
acknowledge
.
<EOS>
He
never
attempted
to
sell
it
 
not
being
in
need
of
money
,
and
not
<EOS>
(
to
give
him
his
due
again
)
making
money
an
object
.
<EOS>
He
never
gave
it
away
;
he
never
even
showed
it
to
any
living
soul
.
<EOS>
Some
said
he
was
afraid
of
its
getting
him
into
a
difficulty
with
the
military
authorities
;
others
(
very
ignorant
indeed
of
the
real
nature
of
the
man
)
said
he
was
afraid
,
if
he
showed
it
,
of
its
costing
him
his
life
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
perhaps
a
grain
of
truth
mixed
up
with
this
last
report
.
<EOS>
It
was
false
to
say
that
he
was
afraid
;
but
it
was
a
fact
that
his
life
had
been
twice
threatened
in
India
;
and
it
was
firmly
believed
that
the
Moonstone
was
at
the
bottom
of
it
.
<EOS>
When
he
came
back
to
England
,
and
found
himself
avoided
by
everybody
,
the
Moonstone
was
thought
to
be
at
the
bottom
of
it
again
.
<EOS>
The
mystery
of
the
Colonel
's
life
got
in
the
Colonel
's
way
,
and
outlawed
him
,
as
you
may
say
,
among
his
own
people
.
<EOS>
The
men
would
n't
let
him
into
their
clubs
;
the
women
 
more
than
one
 
whom
he
wanted
to
marry
,
refused
him
;
friends
and
relations
got
too
near
-
sighted
to
see
him
in
the
street
.
  
<EOS>
Some
men
in
this
mess
would
have
tried
to
set
themselves
right
with
the
world
.
<EOS>
But
to
give
in
,
even
when
he
was
wrong
,
and
had
all
society
against
him
,
was
not
the
way
of
the
Honourable
John
.
<EOS>
He
had
kept
the
Diamond
,
in
flat
defiance
of
assassination
,
in
India
.
<EOS>
He
kept
the
Diamond
,
in
flat
defiance
of
public
opinion
,
in
England
.
<EOS>
There
you
have
the
portrait
of
the
man
before
you
,
as
in
a
picture
:
a
character
that
braved
everything
;
and
a
face
,
handsome
as
it
was
,
that
looked
possessed
by
the
devil
.
  
<EOS>
We
heard
different
rumours
about
him
from
time
to
time
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
they
said
he
was
given
up
to
smoking
opium
and
collecting
old
books
;
sometimes
he
was
reported
to
be
trying
strange
things
in
chemistry
;
sometimes
he
was
seen
carousing
and
amusing
himself
among
the
lowest
people
in
the
lowest
slums
of
London
.
<EOS>
Anyhow
,
a
solitary
,
vicious
,
underground
life
was
the
life
the
Colonel
led
.
<EOS>
Once
,
and
once
only
,
after
his
return
to
England
,
I
myself
saw
him
,
face
to
face
.
  
<EOS>
About
two
years
before
the
time
of
which
I
am
now
writing
,
and
about
a
year
and
a
half
before
the
time
of
his
death
,
the
Colonel
came
unexpectedly
to
my
lady
's
house
in
London
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
night
of
Miss
Rachel
's
birthday
,
the
twenty
-
first
of
June
;
and
there
was
a
party
in
honour
of
it
,
as
usual
.
<EOS>
I
received
a
message
from
the
footman
to
say
that
a
gentleman
wanted
to
see
me
.
<EOS>
Going
up
into
the
hall
,
there
I
found
the
Colonel
,
wasted
,
and
worn
,
and
old
,
and
shabby
,
and
as
wild
and
as
wicked
as
ever
.
  
<EOS>
"
Go
up
to
my
sister
,
"
says
he
;
"
and
say
that
I
have
called
to
wish
my
niece
many
happy
returns
of
the
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
had
made
attempts
by
letter
,
more
than
once
already
,
to
be
reconciled
with
my
lady
,
for
no
other
purpose
,
I
am
firmly
persuaded
,
than
to
annoy
her
.
<EOS>
But
this
was
the
first
time
he
had
actually
come
to
the
house
.
<EOS>
I
had
it
on
the
tip
of
my
tongue
to
say
that
my
mistress
had
a
party
that
night
.
<EOS>
But
the
devilish
look
of
him
daunted
me
.
<EOS>
I
went
up
-
stairs
with
his
message
,
and
left
him
,
by
his
own
desire
,
waiting
in
the
hall
.
<EOS>
The
servants
stood
staring
at
him
,
at
a
distance
,
as
if
he
was
a
walking
engine
of
destruction
,
loaded
with
powder
and
shot
,
and
likely
to
go
off
among
them
at
a
moment
's
notice
.
  
<EOS>
My
lady
had
a
dash
 
no
more
 
of
the
family
temper
.
"
<EOS>
Tell
Colonel
Herncastle
,
"
she
said
,
when
I
gave
her
her
brother
's
message
,
"
that
Miss
Verinder
is
engaged
,
and
that
I
decline
to
see
him
.
<EOS>
"
I
tried
to
plead
for
a
civiller
answer
than
that
;
knowing
the
Colonel
's
constitutional
superiority
to
the
restraints
which
govern
gentlemen
in
general
.
<EOS>
Quite
useless
!
<EOS>
The
family
temper
flashed
out
at
me
directly
.
<EOS>
"
When
I
want
your
advice
,
"
says
my
lady
,
"
you
know
that
I
always
ask
for
it
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
ask
for
it
now
.
<EOS>
"
I
went
downstairs
with
the
message
,
of
which
I
took
the
liberty
of
presenting
a
new
and
amended
edition
of
my
own
contriving
,
as
follows
:
"
My
lady
and
Miss
Rachel
regret
that
they
are
engaged
,
Colonel
;
and
beg
to
be
excused
having
the
honour
of
seeing
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
expected
him
to
break
out
,
even
at
that
polite
way
of
putting
it
.
<EOS>
To
my
surprise
he
did
nothing
of
the
sort
;
he
alarmed
me
by
taking
the
thing
with
an
unnatural
quiet
.
<EOS>
His
eyes
,
of
a
glittering
bright
grey
,
just
settled
on
me
for
a
moment
;
and
he
laughed
,
not
out
of
himself
,
like
other
people
,
but
INTO
himself
,
in
a
soft
,
chuckling
,
horridly
mischievous
way
.
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
Betteredge
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
remember
my
niece
's
birthday
.
<EOS>
"
With
that
,
he
turned
on
his
heel
,
and
walked
out
of
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
The
next
birthday
came
round
,
and
we
heard
he
was
ill
in
bed
.
<EOS>
Six
months
afterwards
 
that
is
to
say
,
six
months
before
the
time
I
am
now
writing
of
 
there
came
a
letter
from
a
highly
respectable
clergyman
to
my
lady
.
<EOS>
It
communicated
two
wonderful
things
in
the
way
of
family
news
.
<EOS>
First
,
that
the
Colonel
had
forgiven
his
sister
on
his
death
-
bed
.
<EOS>
Second
,
that
he
had
forgiven
everybody
else
,
and
had
made
a
most
edifying
end
.
<EOS>
I
have
myself
(
in
spite
of
the
bishops
and
the
clergy
)
<EOS>
an
unfeigned
respect
for
the
Church
;
but
I
am
firmly
persuaded
,
at
the
same
time
,
that
the
devil
remained
in
undisturbed
possession
of
the
Honourable
John
,
and
that
the
last
abominable
act
in
the
life
of
that
abominable
man
was
(
saving
your
presence
)
to
take
the
clergyman
in
!
  
<EOS>
This
was
the
sum
-
total
of
what
I
had
to
tell
Mr.
Franklin
.
<EOS>
I
remarked
that
he
listened
more
and
more
eagerly
the
longer
I
went
on
.
<EOS>
Also
,
that
the
story
of
the
Colonel
being
sent
away
from
his
sister
's
door
,
on
the
occasion
of
his
niece
's
birthday
,
seemed
to
strike
Mr.
Franklin
like
a
shot
that
had
hit
the
mark
.
<EOS>
Though
he
did
n't
acknowledge
it
,
I
saw
that
I
had
made
him
uneasy
,
plainly
enough
,
in
his
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
said
your
say
,
Betteredge
,
"
he
remarked
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
my
turn
now
.
<EOS>
Before
,
however
,
I
tell
you
what
discoveries
I
have
made
in
London
,
and
how
I
came
to
be
mixed
up
in
this
matter
of
the
Diamond
,
I
want
to
know
one
thing
.
<EOS>
You
look
,
my
old
friend
,
as
if
you
did
n't
quite
understand
the
object
to
be
answered
by
this
consultation
of
ours
.
<EOS>
Do
your
looks
belie
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
My
looks
,
on
this
occasion
at
any
rate
,
tell
the
truth
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
In
that
case
,
"
says
Mr.
Franklin
,
"
suppose
I
put
you
up
to
my
point
of
view
,
before
we
go
any
further
.
<EOS>
I
see
three
very
serious
questions
involved
in
the
Colonel
's
birthday
-
gift
to
my
cousin
Rachel
.
<EOS>
Follow
me
carefully
,
Betteredge
;
and
count
me
off
on
your
fingers
,
if
it
will
help
you
,
"
says
Mr.
Franklin
,
with
a
certain
pleasure
in
showing
how
clear
-
headed
he
could
be
,
which
reminded
me
wonderfully
of
old
times
when
he
was
a
boy
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Question
the
first
:
<EOS>
Was
the
Colonel
's
Diamond
the
object
of
a
conspiracy
in
India
?
<EOS>
Question
the
second
:
Has
the
conspiracy
followed
the
Colonel
's
Diamond
to
England
?
<EOS>
Question
the
third
:
<EOS>
Did
the
Colonel
know
the
conspiracy
followed
the
Diamond
;
and
has
he
purposely
left
a
legacy
of
trouble
and
danger
to
his
sister
,
through
the
innocent
medium
of
his
sister
's
child
?
<EOS>
THAT
is
what
I
am
driving
at
,
Betteredge
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
let
me
frighten
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
all
very
well
to
say
that
,
but
he
HAD
frightened
me
.
  
<EOS>
If
he
was
right
,
here
was
our
quiet
English
house
suddenly
invaded
by
a
devilish
Indian
Diamond
 
bringing
after
it
a
conspiracy
of
living
rogues
,
set
loose
on
us
by
the
vengeance
of
a
dead
man
.
<EOS>
There
was
our
situation
as
revealed
to
me
in
Mr.
Franklin
's
last
words
!
<EOS>
Who
ever
heard
the
like
of
it
 
in
the
nineteenth
century
,
mind
;
in
an
age
of
progress
,
and
in
a
country
which
rejoices
in
the
blessings
of
the
British
constitution
?
<EOS>
Nobody
ever
heard
the
like
of
it
,
and
,
consequently
,
nobody
can
be
expected
to
believe
it
.
<EOS>
I
shall
go
on
with
my
story
,
however
,
in
spite
of
that
.
  
<EOS>
When
you
get
a
sudden
alarm
,
of
the
sort
that
I
had
got
now
,
nine
times
out
of
ten
the
place
you
feel
it
in
is
your
stomach
.
<EOS>
When
you
feel
it
in
your
stomach
,
your
attention
wanders
,
and
you
begin
to
fidget
.
<EOS>
I
fidgeted
silently
in
my
place
on
the
sand
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Franklin
noticed
me
,
contending
with
a
perturbed
stomach
or
mind
 
which
you
please
;
they
mean
the
same
thing
 
and
,
checking
himself
just
as
he
was
starting
with
his
part
of
the
story
,
said
to
me
sharply
,
"
What
do
you
want
?
"
  
<EOS>
What
did
I
want
?
<EOS>
I
did
n't
tell
HIM
;
but
I
'll
tell
YOU
,
in
confidence
.
<EOS>
I
wanted
a
whiff
of
my
pipe
,
and
a
turn
at
ROBINSON
CRUSOE
.
    
<EOS>
Keeping
my
private
sentiments
to
myself
,
I
respectfully
requested
Mr.
Franklin
to
go
on
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Franklin
replied
,
"
Do
n't
fidget
,
Betteredge
,
"
and
went
on
.
  
<EOS>
Our
young
gentleman
's
first
words
informed
me
that
his
discoveries
,
concerning
the
wicked
Colonel
and
the
Diamond
,
had
begun
with
a
visit
which
he
had
paid
(
before
he
came
to
us
)
to
the
family
lawyer
,
at
Hampstead
.
<EOS>
A
chance
word
dropped
by
Mr.
Franklin
,
when
the
two
were
alone
,
one
day
,
after
dinner
,
revealed
that
he
had
been
charged
by
his
father
with
a
birthday
present
to
be
taken
to
Miss
Rachel
.
<EOS>
One
thing
led
to
another
;
and
it
ended
in
the
lawyer
mentioning
what
the
present
really
was
,
and
how
the
friendly
connexion
between
the
late
Colonel
and
Mr.
Blake
,
senior
,
had
taken
its
rise
.
<EOS>
The
facts
here
are
really
so
extraordinary
,
that
I
doubt
if
I
can
trust
my
own
language
to
do
justice
to
them
.
<EOS>
I
prefer
trying
to
report
Mr.
Franklin
's
discoveries
,
as
nearly
as
may
be
,
in
Mr.
Franklin
's
own
words
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
remember
the
time
,
Betteredge
,
"
he
said
,
"
when
my
father
was
trying
to
prove
his
title
to
that
unlucky
Dukedom
?
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
that
was
also
the
time
when
my
uncle
Herncastle
returned
from
India
.
<EOS>
My
father
discovered
that
his
brother
-
in
-
law
was
in
possession
of
certain
papers
which
were
likely
to
be
of
service
to
him
in
his
lawsuit
.
<EOS>
He
called
on
the
Colonel
,
on
pretence
of
welcoming
him
back
to
England
.
<EOS>
The
Colonel
was
not
to
be
deluded
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
"
You
want
something
,
"
he
said
,
"
or
you
would
never
have
compromised
your
reputation
by
calling
on
ME
.
<EOS>
"
My
father
saw
that
the
one
chance
for
him
was
to
show
his
hand
;
he
admitted
,
at
once
,
that
he
wanted
the
papers
.
<EOS>
The
Colonel
asked
for
a
day
to
consider
his
answer
.
<EOS>
His
answer
came
in
the
shape
of
a
most
extraordinary
letter
,
which
my
friend
the
lawyer
showed
me
.
<EOS>
The
Colonel
began
by
saying
that
he
wanted
something
of
my
father
,
and
that
he
begged
to
propose
an
exchange
of
friendly
services
between
them
.
<EOS>
The
fortune
of
war
(
that
was
the
expression
he
used
)
had
placed
him
in
possession
of
one
of
the
largest
Diamonds
in
the
world
;
and
he
had
reason
to
believe
that
neither
he
nor
his
precious
jewel
was
safe
in
any
house
,
in
any
quarter
of
the
globe
,
which
they
occupied
together
.
<EOS>
Under
these
alarming
circumstances
,
he
had
determined
to
place
his
Diamond
in
the
keeping
of
another
person
.
<EOS>
That
person
was
not
expected
to
run
any
risk
.
<EOS>
He
might
deposit
the
precious
stone
in
any
place
especially
guarded
and
set
apart
 
like
a
banker
's
or
jeweller
's
strong
-
room
 
for
the
safe
custody
of
valuables
of
high
price
.
<EOS>
His
main
personal
responsibility
in
the
matter
was
to
be
of
the
passive
kind
.
<EOS>
He
was
to
undertake
either
by
himself
,
or
by
a
trustworthy
representative
 
to
receive
at
a
prearranged
address
,
on
certain
prearranged
days
in
every
year
,
a
note
from
the
Colonel
,
simply
stating
the
fact
that
he
was
a
living
man
at
that
date
.
<EOS>
In
the
event
of
the
date
passing
over
without
the
note
being
received
,
the
Colonel
's
silence
might
be
taken
as
a
sure
token
of
the
Colonel
's
death
by
murder
.
<EOS>
In
that
case
,
and
in
no
other
,
certain
sealed
instructions
relating
to
the
disposal
of
the
Diamond
,
and
deposited
with
it
,
were
to
be
opened
,
and
followed
implicitly
.
<EOS>
If
my
father
chose
to
accept
this
strange
charge
,
the
Colonel
's
papers
were
at
his
disposal
in
return
.
<EOS>
That
was
the
letter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
did
your
father
do
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
?
"
says
Mr.
Franklin
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
tell
you
what
he
did
.
<EOS>
He
brought
the
invaluable
faculty
,
called
common
sense
,
to
bear
on
the
Colonel
's
letter
.
<EOS>
The
whole
thing
,
he
declared
,
was
simply
absurd
.
<EOS>
Somewhere
in
his
Indian
wanderings
,
the
Colonel
had
picked
up
with
some
wretched
crystal
which
he
took
for
a
diamond
.
<EOS>
As
for
the
danger
of
his
being
murdered
,
and
the
precautions
devised
to
preserve
his
life
and
his
piece
of
crystal
,
this
was
the
nineteenth
century
,
and
any
man
in
his
senses
had
only
to
apply
to
the
police
.
<EOS>
The
Colonel
had
been
a
notorious
opium
-
eater
for
years
past
;
and
,
if
the
only
way
of
getting
at
the
valuable
papers
he
possessed
was
by
accepting
a
matter
of
opium
as
a
matter
of
fact
,
my
father
was
quite
willing
to
take
the
ridiculous
responsibility
imposed
on
him
 
all
the
more
readily
that
it
involved
no
trouble
to
himself
.
<EOS>
The
Diamond
and
the
sealed
instructions
went
into
his
banker
's
strong
-
room
,
and
the
Colonel
's
letters
,
periodically
reporting
him
a
living
man
,
were
received
and
opened
by
our
family
lawyer
,
Mr.
Bruff
,
as
my
father
's
representative
.
<EOS>
No
sensible
person
,
in
a
similar
position
,
could
have
viewed
the
matter
in
any
other
way
.
<EOS>
Nothing
in
this
world
,
Betteredge
,
is
probable
unless
it
appeals
to
our
own
trumpery
experience
;
and
we
only
believe
in
a
romance
when
we
see
it
in
a
newspaper
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
plain
to
me
from
this
,
that
Mr.
Franklin
thought
his
father
's
notion
about
the
Colonel
hasty
and
wrong
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
your
own
private
opinion
about
the
matter
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
Let
's
finish
the
story
of
the
Colonel
first
,
"
says
Mr.
Franklin
.
<EOS>
"
There
is
a
curious
want
of
system
,
Betteredge
,
in
the
English
mind
;
and
your
question
,
my
old
friend
,
is
an
instance
of
it
.
<EOS>
When
we
are
not
occupied
in
making
machinery
,
we
are
(
mentally
speaking
)
<EOS>
the
most
slovenly
people
in
the
universe
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
So
much
,
"
I
thought
to
myself
,
"
for
a
foreign
education
!
<EOS>
He
has
learned
that
way
of
girding
at
us
in
France
,
I
suppose
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Franklin
took
up
the
lost
thread
,
and
went
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
father
,
"
he
said
,
"
got
the
papers
he
wanted
,
and
never
saw
his
brother
-
in
-
law
again
from
that
time
.
<EOS>
Year
after
year
,
on
the
prearranged
days
,
the
prearranged
letter
came
from
the
Colonel
,
and
was
opened
by
Mr.
Bruff
.
<EOS>
I
have
seen
the
letters
,
in
a
heap
,
all
of
them
written
in
the
same
brief
,
business
-
like
form
of
words
:
"
<EOS>
Sir
,
 
This
is
to
certify
that
I
am
still
a
living
man
.
<EOS>
Let
the
Diamond
be
.
<EOS>
John
Herncastle
.
<EOS>
"
That
was
all
he
ever
wrote
,
and
that
came
regularly
to
the
day
;
until
some
six
or
eight
months
since
,
when
the
form
of
the
letter
varied
for
the
first
time
.
<EOS>
It
ran
now
:
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
 
They
tell
me
I
am
dying
.
<EOS>
Come
to
me
,
and
help
me
to
make
my
will
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Bruff
went
,
and
found
him
,
in
the
little
suburban
villa
,
surrounded
by
its
own
grounds
,
in
which
he
had
lived
alone
,
ever
since
he
had
left
India
.
<EOS>
He
had
dogs
,
cats
,
and
birds
to
keep
him
company
;
but
no
human
being
near
him
,
except
the
person
who
came
daily
to
do
the
house
-
work
,
and
the
doctor
at
the
bedside
.
<EOS>
The
will
was
a
very
simple
matter
.
<EOS>
The
Colonel
had
dissipated
the
greater
part
of
his
fortune
in
his
chemical
investigations
.
<EOS>
His
will
began
and
ended
in
three
clauses
,
which
he
dictated
from
his
bed
,
in
perfect
possession
of
his
faculties
.
<EOS>
The
first
clause
provided
for
the
safe
keeping
and
support
of
his
animals
.
<EOS>
The
second
founded
a
professorship
of
experimental
chemistry
at
a
northern
university
.
<EOS>
The
third
bequeathed
the
Moonstone
as
a
birthday
present
to
his
niece
,
on
condition
that
my
father
would
act
as
executor
.
<EOS>
My
father
at
first
refused
to
act
.
<EOS>
On
second
thoughts
,
however
,
he
gave
way
,
partly
because
he
was
assured
that
the
executorship
would
involve
him
in
no
trouble
;
partly
because
Mr.
Bruff
suggested
,
in
Rachel
's
interest
,
that
the
Diamond
might
be
worth
something
,
after
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
the
Colonel
give
any
reason
,
sir
,
"
I
inquired
,
"
why
he
left
the
Diamond
to
Miss
Rachel
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
not
only
gave
the
reason
 
he
had
the
reason
written
in
his
will
,
"
said
Mr.
Franklin
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
got
an
extract
,
which
you
shall
see
presently
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
be
slovenly
-
minded
,
Betteredge
!
<EOS>
One
thing
at
a
time
.
<EOS>
You
have
heard
about
the
Colonel
's
Will
;
now
you
must
hear
what
happened
after
the
Colonel
's
death
.
<EOS>
It
was
formally
necessary
to
have
the
Diamond
valued
,
before
the
Will
could
be
proved
.
<EOS>
All
the
jewellers
consulted
,
at
once
confirmed
the
Colonel
's
assertion
that
he
possessed
one
of
the
largest
diamonds
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
The
question
of
accurately
valuing
it
presented
some
serious
difficulties
.
<EOS>
Its
size
made
it
a
phenomenon
in
the
diamond
market
;
its
colour
placed
it
in
a
category
by
itself
;
and
,
to
add
to
these
elements
of
uncertainty
,
there
was
a
defect
,
in
the
shape
of
a
flaw
,
in
the
very
heart
of
the
stone
.
<EOS>
Even
with
this
last
serious
draw
-
back
,
however
,
the
lowest
of
the
various
estimates
given
was
twenty
thousand
pounds
.
<EOS>
Conceive
my
father
's
astonishment
!
<EOS>
He
had
been
within
a
hair's
-
breadth
of
refusing
to
act
as
executor
,
and
of
allowing
this
magnificent
jewel
to
be
lost
to
the
family
.
<EOS>
The
interest
he
took
in
the
matter
now
,
induced
him
to
open
the
sealed
instructions
which
had
been
deposited
with
the
Diamond
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bruff
showed
this
document
to
me
,
with
the
other
papers
;
and
it
suggests
(
to
my
mind
)
<EOS>
a
clue
to
the
nature
of
the
conspiracy
which
threatened
the
Colonel
's
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
you
do
believe
,
sir
,
"
I
said
,
"
that
there
was
a
conspiracy
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
possessing
my
father
's
excellent
common
sense
,
"
answered
Mr.
Franklin
,
"
I
believe
the
Colonel
's
life
was
threatened
,
exactly
as
the
Colonel
said
.
<EOS>
The
sealed
instructions
,
as
I
think
,
explain
how
it
was
that
he
died
,
after
all
,
quietly
in
his
bed
.
<EOS>
In
the
event
of
his
death
by
violence
(
that
is
to
say
,
in
the
absence
of
the
regular
letter
from
him
at
the
appointed
date
)
,
my
father
was
then
directed
to
send
the
Moonstone
secretly
to
Amsterdam
.
<EOS>
It
was
to
be
deposited
in
that
city
with
a
famous
diamond
-
cutter
,
and
it
was
to
be
cut
up
into
from
four
to
six
separate
stones
.
<EOS>
The
stones
were
then
to
be
sold
for
what
they
would
fetch
,
and
the
proceeds
were
to
be
applied
to
the
founding
of
that
professorship
of
experimental
chemistry
,
which
the
Colonel
has
since
endowed
by
his
Will
.
<EOS>
Now
,
Betteredge
,
exert
those
sharp
wits
of
yours
,
and
observe
the
conclusion
to
which
the
Colonel
's
instructions
point
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
instantly
exerted
my
wits
.
<EOS>
They
were
of
the
slovenly
English
sort
;
and
they
consequently
muddled
it
all
,
until
Mr.
Franklin
took
them
in
hand
,
and
pointed
out
what
they
ought
to
see
.
  
<EOS>
"
Remark
,
"
says
Mr.
Franklin
,
"
that
the
integrity
of
the
Diamond
,
as
a
whole
stone
,
is
here
artfully
made
dependent
on
the
preservation
from
violence
of
the
Colonel
's
life
.
<EOS>
He
is
not
satisfied
with
saying
to
the
enemies
he
dreads
,
"
Kill
me
 
and
you
will
be
no
nearer
to
the
Diamond
than
you
are
now
;
it
is
where
you
ca
n't
get
at
it
 
in
the
guarded
strong
-
room
of
a
bank
.
"
<EOS>
He
says
instead
,
"
Kill
me
 
and
the
Diamond
will
be
the
Diamond
no
longer
;
its
identity
will
be
destroyed
.
<EOS>
"
What
does
that
mean
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Here
I
had
(
as
I
thought
)
a
flash
of
the
wonderful
foreign
brightness
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
It
means
lowering
the
value
of
the
stone
,
and
cheating
the
rogues
in
that
way
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nothing
of
the
sort
,
"
says
Mr.
Franklin
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
inquired
about
that
.
<EOS>
The
flawed
Diamond
,
cut
up
,
would
actually
fetch
more
than
the
Diamond
as
it
now
is
;
for
this
plain
reason
 
that
from
four
to
six
perfect
brilliants
might
be
cut
from
it
,
which
would
be
,
collectively
,
worth
more
money
than
the
large
 
but
imperfect
single
stone
.
<EOS>
If
robbery
for
the
purpose
of
gain
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
conspiracy
,
the
Colonel
's
instructions
absolutely
made
the
Diamond
better
worth
stealing
.
<EOS>
More
money
could
have
been
got
for
it
,
and
the
disposal
of
it
in
the
diamond
market
would
have
been
infinitely
easier
,
if
it
had
passed
through
the
hands
of
the
workmen
of
Amsterdam
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Lord
bless
us
,
sir
!
"
I
burst
out
.
<EOS>
"
What
was
the
plot
,
then
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
A
plot
organised
among
the
Indians
who
originally
owned
the
jewel
,
"
says
Mr.
Franklin
 
"
a
plot
with
some
old
Hindoo
superstition
at
the
bottom
of
it
.
<EOS>
That
is
my
opinion
,
confirmed
by
a
family
paper
which
I
have
about
me
at
this
moment
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
saw
,
now
,
why
the
appearance
of
the
three
Indian
jugglers
at
our
house
had
presented
itself
to
Mr.
Franklin
in
the
light
of
a
circumstance
worth
noting
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
want
to
force
my
opinion
on
you
,
"
Mr.
Franklin
went
on
.
<EOS>
"
The
idea
of
certain
chosen
servants
of
an
old
Hindoo
superstition
devoting
themselves
,
through
all
difficulties
and
dangers
,
to
watching
the
opportunity
of
recovering
their
sacred
gem
,
appears
to
me
to
be
perfectly
consistent
with
everything
that
we
know
of
the
patience
of
Oriental
races
,
and
the
influence
of
Oriental
religions
.
<EOS>
But
then
I
am
an
imaginative
man
;
and
the
butcher
,
the
baker
,
and
the
tax
-
gatherer
,
are
not
the
only
credible
realities
in
existence
to
my
mind
.
<EOS>
Let
the
guess
I
have
made
at
the
truth
in
this
matter
go
for
what
it
is
worth
,
and
let
us
get
on
to
the
only
practical
question
that
concerns
us
.
<EOS>
Does
the
conspiracy
against
the
Moonstone
survive
the
Colonel
's
death
?
<EOS>
And
did
the
Colonel
know
it
,
when
he
left
the
birthday
gift
to
his
niece
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
began
to
see
my
lady
and
Miss
Rachel
at
the
end
of
it
all
,
now
.
<EOS>
Not
a
word
he
said
escaped
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
not
very
willing
,
when
I
discovered
the
story
of
the
Moonstone
,
"
said
Mr.
Franklin
,
"
to
be
the
means
of
bringing
it
here
.
<EOS>
But
Mr.
Bruff
reminded
me
that
somebody
must
put
my
cousin
's
legacy
into
my
cousin
's
hands
 
and
that
I
might
as
well
do
it
as
anybody
else
.
<EOS>
After
taking
the
Diamond
out
of
the
bank
,
I
fancied
I
was
followed
in
the
streets
by
a
shabby
,
dark
-
complexioned
man
.
<EOS>
I
went
to
my
father
's
house
to
pick
up
my
luggage
,
and
found
a
letter
there
,
which
unexpectedly
detained
me
in
London
.
<EOS>
I
went
back
to
the
bank
with
the
Diamond
,
and
thought
I
saw
the
shabby
man
again
.
<EOS>
Taking
the
Diamond
once
more
out
of
the
bank
this
morning
,
I
saw
the
man
for
the
third
time
,
gave
him
the
slip
,
and
started
(
before
he
recovered
the
trace
of
me
)
by
the
morning
instead
of
the
afternoon
train
.
<EOS>
Here
I
am
,
with
the
Diamond
safe
and
sound
 
and
what
is
the
first
news
that
meets
me
?
<EOS>
I
find
that
three
strolling
Indians
have
been
at
the
house
,
and
that
my
arrival
from
London
,
and
something
which
I
am
expected
to
have
about
me
,
are
two
special
objects
of
investigation
to
them
when
they
believe
themselves
to
be
alone
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
waste
time
and
words
on
their
pouring
the
ink
into
the
boy
's
hand
,
and
telling
him
to
look
in
it
for
a
man
at
a
distance
,
and
for
something
in
that
man
's
pocket
.
<EOS>
The
thing
(
which
I
have
often
seen
done
in
the
East
)
is
"
hocus
-
pocus
'
in
my
opinion
,
as
it
is
in
yours
.
<EOS>
The
present
question
for
us
to
decide
is
,
whether
I
am
wrongly
attaching
a
meaning
to
a
mere
accident
?
<EOS>
or
whether
we
really
have
evidence
of
the
Indians
being
on
the
track
of
the
Moonstone
,
the
moment
it
is
removed
from
the
safe
keeping
of
the
bank
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Neither
he
nor
I
seemed
to
fancy
dealing
with
this
part
of
the
inquiry
.
<EOS>
We
looked
at
each
other
,
and
then
we
looked
at
the
tide
,
oozing
in
smoothly
,
higher
and
higher
,
over
the
Shivering
Sand
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
are
you
thinking
of
?
"
says
Mr.
Franklin
,
suddenly
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
thinking
,
sir
,
"
I
answered
,
"
that
I
should
like
to
shy
the
Diamond
into
the
quicksand
,
and
settle
the
question
in
THAT
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
If
you
have
got
the
value
of
the
stone
in
your
pocket
,
"
answered
Mr.
Franklin
,
"
say
so
,
Betteredge
,
and
in
it
goes
!
"
  
<EOS>
It
's
curious
to
note
,
when
your
mind
's
anxious
,
how
very
far
in
the
way
of
relief
a
very
small
joke
will
go
.
<EOS>
We
found
a
fund
of
merriment
,
at
the
time
,
in
the
notion
of
making
away
with
Miss
Rachel
's
lawful
property
,
and
getting
Mr.
Blake
,
as
executor
,
into
dreadful
trouble
 
though
where
the
merriment
was
,
I
am
quite
at
a
loss
to
discover
now
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Franklin
was
the
first
to
bring
the
talk
back
to
the
talk
's
proper
purpose
.
<EOS>
He
took
an
envelope
out
of
his
pocket
,
opened
it
,
and
handed
to
me
the
paper
inside
.
  
<EOS>
"
Betteredge
,
"
he
said
,
"
we
must
face
the
question
of
the
Colonel
's
motive
in
leaving
this
legacy
to
his
niece
,
for
my
aunt
's
sake
.
<EOS>
Bear
in
mind
how
Lady
Verinder
treated
her
brother
from
the
time
when
he
returned
to
England
,
to
the
time
when
he
told
you
he
should
remember
his
niece
's
birthday
.
<EOS>
And
read
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
gave
me
the
extract
from
the
Colonel
's
Will
.
<EOS>
I
have
got
it
by
me
while
I
write
these
words
;
and
I
copy
it
,
as
follows
,
for
your
benefit
:
  
"
Thirdly
,
and
lastly
,
I
give
and
bequeath
to
my
niece
,
Rachel
Verinder
,
daughter
and
only
child
of
my
sister
,
Julia
Verinder
,
widow
 
<EOS>
if
her
mother
,
the
said
Julia
Verinder
,
shall
be
living
on
the
said
Rachel
Verinder
's
next
Birthday
after
my
death
 
<EOS>
the
yellow
Diamond
belonging
to
me
,
and
known
in
the
East
by
the
name
of
The
Moonstone
:
<EOS>
subject
to
this
condition
,
that
her
mother
,
the
said
Julia
Verinder
,
shall
be
living
at
the
time
.
<EOS>
And
I
hereby
desire
my
executor
to
give
my
Diamond
,
either
by
his
own
hands
or
by
the
hands
of
some
trustworthy
representative
whom
he
shall
appoint
,
into
the
personal
possession
of
my
<EOS>
said
<EOS>
niece
Rachel
,
on
her
next
birthday
after
my
death
,
and
in
the
presence
,
if
possible
,
of
my
sister
,
the
said
Julia
Verinder
.
<EOS>
And
I
desire
that
my
said
sister
may
be
informed
,
by
means
of
a
true
copy
of
this
,
the
third
and
last
clause
of
my
Will
,
that
I
give
the
Diamond
to
her
daughter
Rachel
,
in
token
of
my
free
forgiveness
of
the
injury
which
her
conduct
towards
me
has
been
the
means
of
inflicting
on
my
reputation
in
my
lifetime
;
and
especially
in
proof
that
I
pardon
,
as
becomes
a
dying
man
,
the
insult
offered
to
me
as
an
officer
and
a
gentleman
,
when
her
servant
,
by
her
orders
,
closed
the
door
of
her
house
against
me
,
on
the
occasion
of
her
daughter
's
birthday
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
More
words
followed
these
,
providing
if
my
lady
was
dead
,
or
if
Miss
Rachel
was
dead
,
at
the
time
of
the
testator
's
decease
,
for
the
Diamond
being
sent
to
Holland
,
in
accordance
with
the
sealed
instructions
originally
deposited
with
it
.
<EOS>
The
proceeds
of
the
sale
were
,
in
that
case
,
to
be
added
to
the
money
already
left
by
the
Will
for
the
professorship
of
chemistry
at
the
university
in
the
north
.
  
<EOS>
I
handed
the
paper
back
to
Mr.
Franklin
,
sorely
troubled
what
to
say
to
him
.
<EOS>
Up
to
that
moment
,
my
own
opinion
had
been
(
as
you
know
)
that
the
Colonel
had
died
as
wickedly
as
he
had
lived
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
say
the
copy
from
his
Will
actually
converted
me
from
that
opinion
<EOS>
:
I
only
say
it
staggered
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
says
Mr.
Franklin
,
"
now
you
have
read
the
Colonel
's
own
statement
,
what
do
you
say
?
<EOS>
In
bringing
the
Moonstone
to
my
aunt
's
house
,
am
I
serving
his
vengeance
blindfold
,
or
am
I
vindicating
him
in
the
character
of
a
penitent
and
Christian
man
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
seems
hard
to
say
,
sir
,
"
I
answered
,
"
that
he
died
with
a
horrid
revenge
in
his
heart
,
and
a
horrid
lie
on
his
lips
.
<EOS>
God
alone
knows
the
truth
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
ask
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Franklin
sat
twisting
and
turning
the
extract
from
the
Will
in
his
fingers
,
as
if
he
expected
to
squeeze
the
truth
out
of
it
in
that
manner
.
<EOS>
He
altered
quite
remarkably
,
at
the
same
time
.
<EOS>
From
being
brisk
and
bright
,
he
now
became
,
most
unaccountably
,
a
slow
,
solemn
,
and
pondering
young
man
.
  
<EOS>
"
This
question
has
two
sides
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
An
Objective
side
,
and
a
Subjective
side
.
<EOS>
Which
are
we
to
take
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
had
had
a
German
education
as
well
as
a
French
.
<EOS>
One
of
the
two
had
been
in
undisturbed
possession
of
him
(
as
I
supposed
)
up
to
this
time
.
<EOS>
And
now
(
as
well
as
I
could
make
out
)
<EOS>
the
other
was
taking
its
place
.
<EOS>
It
is
one
of
my
rules
in
life
,
never
to
notice
what
I
do
n't
understand
.
<EOS>
I
steered
a
middle
course
between
the
Objective
side
and
the
Subjective
side
.
<EOS>
In
plain
English
I
stared
hard
,
and
said
nothing
.
  
<EOS>
"
Let
's
extract
the
inner
meaning
of
this
,
"
says
Mr.
Franklin
.
<EOS>
"
Why
did
my
uncle
leave
the
Diamond
to
Rachel
?
<EOS>
Why
did
n't
he
leave
it
to
my
aunt
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
not
beyond
guessing
,
sir
,
at
any
rate
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
Colonel
Herncastle
knew
my
lady
well
enough
to
know
that
she
would
have
refused
to
accept
any
legacy
that
came
to
her
from
HIM
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
did
he
know
that
Rachel
might
not
refuse
to
accept
it
,
too
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
there
any
young
lady
in
existence
,
sir
,
who
could
resist
the
temptation
of
accepting
such
a
birthday
present
as
The
Moonstone
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
the
Subjective
view
,
"
says
Mr.
Franklin
.
<EOS>
"
It
does
you
great
credit
,
Betteredge
,
to
be
able
to
take
the
Subjective
view
.
<EOS>
But
there
's
another
mystery
about
the
Colonel
's
legacy
which
is
not
accounted
for
yet
.
<EOS>
How
are
we
to
explain
his
only
giving
Rachel
her
birthday
present
conditionally
on
her
mother
being
alive
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
want
to
slander
a
dead
man
,
sir
,
"
I
answered
.
<EOS>
"
But
if
he
HAS
purposely
left
a
legacy
of
trouble
and
danger
to
his
sister
,
by
the
means
of
her
child
,
it
must
be
a
legacy
made
conditional
on
his
sister
's
being
alive
to
feel
the
vexation
of
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
<EOS>
That
's
your
interpretation
of
his
motive
,
is
it
?
<EOS>
The
Subjective
interpretation
again
!
<EOS>
Have
you
ever
been
in
Germany
,
Betteredge
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
.
<EOS>
What
's
your
interpretation
,
if
you
please
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
see
,
"
says
Mr.
Franklin
,
"
that
the
Colonel
's
object
may
,
quite
possibly
,
have
been
 
not
to
benefit
his
niece
,
whom
he
had
never
even
seen
 
but
to
prove
to
his
sister
that
he
had
died
forgiving
her
,
and
to
prove
it
very
prettily
by
means
of
a
present
made
to
her
child
.
<EOS>
There
is
a
totally
different
explanation
from
yours
,
Betteredge
,
taking
its
rise
in
a
Subjective
-
Objective
point
of
view
.
<EOS>
From
all
I
can
see
,
one
interpretation
is
just
as
likely
to
be
right
as
the
other
.
"
  
<EOS>
Having
brought
matters
to
this
pleasant
and
comforting
issue
,
Mr.
Franklin
appeared
to
think
that
he
had
completed
all
that
was
required
of
him
.
<EOS>
He
laid
down
flat
on
his
back
on
the
sand
,
and
asked
what
was
to
be
done
next
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
been
so
clever
,
and
clear
-
headed
(
before
he
began
to
talk
the
foreign
gibberish
)
,
and
had
so
completely
taken
the
lead
in
the
business
up
to
the
present
time
,
that
I
was
quite
unprepared
for
such
a
sudden
change
as
he
now
exhibited
in
this
helpless
leaning
upon
me
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
till
later
that
I
learned
 
by
assistance
of
Miss
Rachel
,
who
was
the
first
to
make
the
discovery
 
that
these
puzzling
shifts
and
transformations
in
Mr.
Franklin
were
due
to
the
effect
on
him
of
his
foreign
training
.
<EOS>
At
the
age
when
we
are
all
of
us
most
apt
to
take
our
colouring
,
in
the
form
of
a
reflection
from
the
colouring
of
other
people
,
he
had
been
sent
abroad
,
and
had
been
passed
on
from
one
nation
to
another
,
before
there
was
time
for
any
one
colouring
more
than
another
to
settle
itself
on
him
firmly
.
<EOS>
As
a
consequence
of
this
,
he
had
come
back
with
so
many
different
sides
to
his
character
,
all
more
or
less
jarring
with
each
other
,
that
he
seemed
to
pass
his
life
in
a
state
of
perpetual
contradiction
with
himself
.
<EOS>
He
could
be
a
busy
man
,
and
a
lazy
man
;
cloudy
in
the
head
,
and
clear
in
the
head
;
a
model
of
determination
,
and
a
spectacle
of
helplessness
,
all
together
.
<EOS>
He
had
his
French
side
,
and
his
German
side
,
and
his
Italian
side
 
<EOS>
the
original
English
foundation
showing
through
,
every
now
and
then
,
as
much
as
to
say
,
"
Here
I
am
,
sorely
transmogrified
,
as
you
see
,
but
there
's
something
of
me
left
at
the
bottom
of
him
still
.
"
<EOS>
Miss
Rachel
used
to
remark
that
the
Italian
side
of
him
was
uppermost
,
on
those
occasions
when
he
unexpectedly
gave
in
,
and
asked
you
in
his
nice
sweet
-
tempered
way
to
take
his
own
responsibilities
on
your
shoulders
.
<EOS>
You
will
do
him
no
injustice
,
I
think
,
if
you
conclude
that
the
Italian
side
of
him
was
uppermost
now
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
n't
it
your
business
,
sir
,
"
I
asked
,
"
to
know
what
to
do
next
?
<EOS>
Surely
it
ca
n't
be
mine
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Franklin
did
n't
appear
to
see
the
force
of
my
question
 
not
being
in
a
position
,
at
the
time
,
to
see
anything
but
the
sky
over
his
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
want
to
alarm
my
aunt
without
reason
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
And
I
do
n't
want
to
leave
her
without
what
may
be
a
needful
warning
.
<EOS>
If
you
were
in
my
place
,
Betteredge
,
tell
me
,
in
one
word
,
what
would
you
do
?
"
  
<EOS>
In
one
word
,
I
told
him
:
"
Wait
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
With
all
my
heart
,
"
says
Mr.
Franklin
.
<EOS>
"
How
long
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
proceeded
to
explain
myself
.
  
<EOS>
"
As
I
understand
it
,
sir
,
"
I
said
,
"
somebody
is
bound
to
put
this
plaguy
Diamond
into
Miss
Rachel
's
hands
on
her
birthday
 
<EOS>
and
you
may
as
well
do
it
as
another
.
<EOS>
Very
good
.
<EOS>
This
is
the
twenty
-
fifth
of
May
,
and
the
birthday
is
on
the
twenty
-
first
of
June
.
<EOS>
We
have
got
close
on
four
weeks
before
us
.
<EOS>
Let
's
wait
and
see
what
happens
in
that
time
;
and
let
's
warn
my
lady
,
or
not
,
as
the
circumstances
direct
us
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Perfect
,
Betteredge
,
as
far
as
it
goes
!
"
says
Mr.
Franklin
.
<EOS>
"
But
between
this
and
the
birthday
,
what
's
to
be
done
with
the
Diamond
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
your
father
did
with
it
,
to
be
sure
,
sir
!
<EOS>
"
I
answered
.
<EOS>
"
Your
father
put
it
in
the
safe
keeping
of
a
bank
in
London
.
<EOS>
You
put
in
the
safe
keeping
of
the
bank
at
Frizinghall
.
"
<EOS>
(
Frizinghall
was
our
nearest
town
,
and
the
Bank
of
England
was
n't
safer
than
the
bank
there
.
)
<EOS>
"
If
I
were
you
,
sir
,
"
I
added
,
"
I
would
ride
straight
away
with
it
to
Frizinghall
before
the
ladies
come
back
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
prospect
of
doing
something
 
and
,
what
is
more
,
of
doing
that
something
on
a
horse
 
brought
Mr.
Franklin
up
like
lightning
from
the
flat
of
his
back
.
<EOS>
He
sprang
to
his
feet
,
and
pulled
me
up
,
without
ceremony
,
on
to
mine
.
"
<EOS>
Betteredge
,
you
are
worth
your
weight
in
gold
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
Come
along
,
and
saddle
the
best
horse
in
the
stables
directly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Here
(
God
bless
it
!
)
<EOS>
was
the
original
English
foundation
of
him
showing
through
all
the
foreign
varnish
at
last
!
<EOS>
Here
was
the
Master
Franklin
I
remembered
,
coming
out
again
in
the
good
old
way
at
the
prospect
of
a
ride
,
and
reminding
me
of
the
good
old
times
!
<EOS>
Saddle
a
horse
for
him
?
<EOS>
I
would
have
saddled
a
dozen
horses
,
if
he
could
only
have
ridden
them
all
!
  
<EOS>
We
went
back
to
the
house
in
a
hurry
;
we
had
the
fleetest
horse
in
the
stables
saddled
in
a
hurry
;
and
Mr.
Franklin
rattled
off
in
a
hurry
,
to
lodge
the
cursed
Diamond
once
more
in
the
strong
-
room
of
a
bank
.
<EOS>
When
I
heard
the
last
of
his
horse
's
hoofs
on
the
drive
,
and
when
I
turned
about
in
the
yard
and
found
I
was
alone
again
,
I
felt
half
inclined
to
ask
myself
if
I
had
n't
woke
up
from
a
dream
.
    
<EOS>
While
I
was
in
this
bewildered
frame
of
mind
,
sorely
needing
a
little
quiet
time
by
myself
to
put
me
right
again
,
my
daughter
Penelope
got
in
my
way
(
just
as
her
late
mother
used
to
get
in
my
way
on
the
stairs
)
,
and
instantly
summoned
me
to
tell
her
all
that
had
passed
at
the
conference
between
Mr.
Franklin
and
me
.
<EOS>
Under
present
circumstances
,
the
one
thing
to
be
done
was
to
clap
the
extinguisher
upon
Penelope
's
curiosity
on
the
spot
.
<EOS>
I
accordingly
replied
that
Mr.
Franklin
and
I
had
both
talked
of
foreign
politics
,
till
we
could
talk
no
longer
,
and
had
then
mutually
fallen
asleep
in
the
heat
of
the
sun
.
<EOS>
Try
that
sort
of
answer
when
your
wife
or
your
daughter
next
worries
you
with
an
awkward
question
at
an
awkward
time
,
and
depend
on
the
natural
sweetness
of
women
for
kissing
and
making
it
up
again
at
the
next
opportunity
.
  
<EOS>
The
afternoon
wore
on
,
and
my
lady
and
Miss
Rachel
came
back
.
  
<EOS>
Needless
to
say
how
astonished
they
were
,
when
they
heard
that
Mr.
Franklin
Blake
had
arrived
,
and
had
gone
off
again
on
horseback
.
<EOS>
Needless
also
to
say
,
that
THEY
asked
awkward
questions
directly
,
and
that
the
"
foreign
politics
"
and
the
"
falling
asleep
in
the
sun
"
would
n't
serve
a
second
time
over
with
THEM
.
<EOS>
Being
at
the
end
of
my
invention
,
I
said
Mr.
Franklin
's
arrival
by
the
early
train
was
entirely
attributable
to
one
of
Mr.
Franklin
's
freaks
.
<EOS>
Being
asked
,
upon
that
,
whether
his
galloping
off
again
on
horseback
was
another
of
Mr.
Franklin
's
freaks
,
I
said
,
"
Yes
,
it
was
;
"
and
slipped
out
of
it
 
<EOS>
I
think
very
cleverly
 
in
that
way
.
  
<EOS>
Having
got
over
my
difficulties
with
the
ladies
,
I
found
more
difficulties
waiting
for
me
when
I
went
back
to
my
own
room
.
<EOS>
In
came
Penelope
 
with
the
natural
sweetness
of
women
 
to
kiss
and
make
it
up
again
;
and
 
with
the
natural
curiosity
of
women
 
to
ask
another
question
.
<EOS>
This
time
she
only
wanted
me
to
tell
her
what
was
the
matter
with
our
second
housemaid
,
Rosanna
Spearman
.
  
<EOS>
After
leaving
Mr.
Franklin
and
me
at
the
Shivering
Sand
,
Rosanna
,
it
appeared
,
had
returned
to
the
house
in
a
very
unaccountable
state
of
mind
.
<EOS>
She
had
turned
(
if
Penelope
was
to
be
believed
)
<EOS>
all
the
colours
of
the
rainbow
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
merry
without
reason
,
and
sad
without
reason
.
<EOS>
In
one
breath
she
asked
hundreds
of
questions
about
Mr.
Franklin
Blake
,
and
in
another
breath
she
had
been
angry
with
Penelope
for
presuming
to
suppose
that
a
strange
gentleman
could
possess
any
interest
for
her
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
surprised
,
smiling
,
and
scribbling
Mr.
Franklin
's
name
inside
her
workbox
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
surprised
again
,
crying
and
looking
at
her
deformed
shoulder
in
the
glass
.
<EOS>
Had
she
and
Mr.
Franklin
known
anything
of
each
other
before
to
-
day
?
<EOS>
Quite
impossible
!
<EOS>
Had
they
heard
anything
of
each
other
?
<EOS>
Impossible
again
!
<EOS>
I
could
speak
to
Mr.
Franklin
's
astonishment
as
genuine
,
when
he
saw
how
the
girl
stared
at
him
.
<EOS>
Penelope
could
speak
to
the
girl
's
inquisitiveness
as
genuine
,
when
she
asked
questions
about
Mr.
Franklin
.
<EOS>
The
conference
between
us
,
conducted
in
this
way
,
was
tiresome
enough
,
until
my
daughter
suddenly
ended
it
by
bursting
out
with
what
I
thought
the
most
monstrous
supposition
I
had
ever
heard
in
my
life
.
  
<EOS>
"
Father
!
<EOS>
"
says
Penelope
,
quite
seriously
,
"
there
's
only
one
explanation
of
it
.
<EOS>
Rosanna
has
fallen
in
love
with
Mr.
Franklin
Blake
at
first
sight
!
"
  
<EOS>
You
have
heard
of
beautiful
young
ladies
falling
in
love
at
first
sight
,
and
have
thought
it
natural
enough
.
<EOS>
But
a
housemaid
out
of
a
reformatory
,
with
a
plain
face
and
a
deformed
shoulder
,
falling
in
love
,
at
first
sight
,
with
a
gentleman
who
comes
on
a
visit
to
her
mistress
's
house
,
match
me
that
,
in
the
way
of
an
absurdity
,
out
of
any
story
-
book
in
Christendom
,
if
you
can
!
<EOS>
I
laughed
till
the
tears
rolled
down
my
cheeks
.
<EOS>
Penelope
resented
my
merriment
,
in
rather
a
strange
way
.
<EOS>
"
I
never
knew
you
cruel
before
,
father
,
"
she
said
,
very
gently
,
and
went
out
.
  
<EOS>
My
girl
's
words
fell
upon
me
like
a
splash
of
cold
water
.
<EOS>
I
was
savage
with
myself
,
for
feeling
uneasy
in
myself
the
moment
she
had
spoken
them
 
<EOS>
but
so
it
was
.
<EOS>
We
will
change
the
subject
,
if
you
please
.
<EOS>
I
am
sorry
I
drifted
into
writing
about
it
;
and
not
without
reason
,
as
you
will
see
when
we
have
gone
on
together
a
little
longer
.
  
<EOS>
The
evening
came
,
and
the
dressing
-
bell
for
dinner
rang
,
before
Mr.
Franklin
returned
from
Frizinghall
.
<EOS>
I
took
his
hot
water
up
to
his
room
myself
,
expecting
to
hear
,
after
this
extraordinary
delay
,
that
something
had
happened
.
<EOS>
To
my
great
disappointment
(
and
no
doubt
to
yours
also
)
,
nothing
had
happened
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
met
with
the
Indians
,
either
going
or
returning
.
<EOS>
He
had
deposited
the
Moonstone
in
the
bank
 
describing
it
merely
as
a
valuable
of
great
price
 
and
he
had
got
the
receipt
for
it
safe
in
his
pocket
.
<EOS>
I
went
down
-
stairs
,
feeling
that
this
was
rather
a
flat
ending
,
after
all
our
excitement
about
the
Diamond
earlier
in
the
day
.
  
<EOS>
How
the
meeting
between
Mr.
Franklin
and
his
aunt
and
cousin
went
off
,
is
more
than
I
can
tell
you
.
  
<EOS>
I
would
have
given
something
to
have
waited
at
table
that
day
.
<EOS>
But
,
in
my
position
in
the
household
,
waiting
at
dinner
(
except
on
high
family
festivals
)
was
letting
down
my
dignity
in
the
eyes
of
the
other
servants
 
a
thing
which
my
lady
considered
me
quite
prone
enough
to
do
already
,
without
seeking
occasions
for
it
.
<EOS>
The
news
brought
to
me
from
the
upper
regions
,
that
evening
,
came
from
Penelope
and
the
footman
.
<EOS>
Penelope
mentioned
that
she
had
never
known
Miss
Rachel
so
particular
about
the
dressing
of
her
hair
,
and
had
never
seen
her
look
so
bright
and
pretty
as
she
did
when
she
went
down
to
meet
Mr.
Franklin
in
the
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
The
footman
's
report
was
,
that
the
preservation
of
a
respectful
composure
in
the
presence
of
his
betters
,
and
the
waiting
on
Mr.
Franklin
Blake
at
dinner
,
were
two
of
the
hardest
things
to
reconcile
with
each
other
that
had
ever
tried
his
training
in
service
.
<EOS>
Later
in
the
evening
,
we
heard
them
singing
and
playing
duets
,
Mr.
Franklin
piping
high
,
Miss
Rachel
piping
higher
,
and
my
lady
,
on
the
piano
,
<EOS>
following
them
as
it
were
over
hedge
and
ditch
,
and
seeing
them
safe
through
it
in
a
manner
most
wonderful
and
pleasant
to
hear
through
the
open
windows
,
on
the
terrace
at
night
.
<EOS>
Later
still
,
I
went
to
Mr.
Franklin
in
the
smoking
-
room
,
with
the
soda
-
water
and
brandy
,
and
found
that
Miss
Rachel
had
put
the
Diamond
clean
out
of
his
head
.
<EOS>
"
She
's
the
most
charming
girl
I
have
seen
since
I
came
back
to
England
!
"
was
all
I
could
extract
from
him
,
when
I
endeavoured
to
lead
the
conversation
to
more
serious
things
.
  
<EOS>
Towards
midnight
,
I
went
round
the
house
to
lock
up
,
accompanied
by
my
second
in
command
<EOS>
(
Samuel
,
the
footman
)
,
as
usual
.
<EOS>
When
all
the
doors
were
made
fast
,
except
the
side
door
that
opened
on
the
terrace
,
I
sent
Samuel
to
bed
,
and
stepped
out
for
a
breath
of
fresh
air
before
I
too
went
to
bed
in
my
turn
.
  
<EOS>
The
night
was
still
and
close
,
and
the
moon
was
at
the
full
in
the
heavens
.
<EOS>
It
was
so
silent
out
of
doors
,
that
I
heard
from
time
to
time
,
very
faint
and
low
,
the
fall
of
the
sea
,
as
the
ground
-
swell
heaved
it
in
on
the
sand
-
bank
near
the
mouth
of
our
little
bay
.
<EOS>
As
the
house
stood
,
the
terrace
side
was
the
dark
side
;
but
the
broad
moonlight
showed
fair
on
the
gravel
walk
that
ran
along
the
next
side
to
the
terrace
.
<EOS>
Looking
this
way
,
after
looking
up
at
the
sky
,
I
saw
the
shadow
of
a
person
in
the
moonlight
thrown
forward
from
behind
the
corner
of
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
Being
old
and
sly
,
I
forbore
to
call
out
;
but
being
also
,
unfortunately
,
old
and
heavy
,
my
feet
betrayed
me
on
the
gravel
.
<EOS>
Before
I
could
steal
suddenly
round
the
corner
,
as
I
had
proposed
,
I
heard
lighter
feet
than
mine
 
and
more
than
one
pair
of
them
as
I
thought
 
retreating
in
a
hurry
.
<EOS>
By
the
time
I
had
got
to
the
corner
,
the
trespassers
,
whoever
they
were
,
had
run
into
the
shrubbery
at
the
off
side
of
the
walk
,
and
were
hidden
from
sight
among
the
thick
trees
and
bushes
in
that
part
of
the
grounds
.
<EOS>
From
the
shrubbery
,
they
could
easily
make
their
way
,
over
our
fence
into
the
road
.
<EOS>
If
I
had
been
forty
years
younger
,
I
might
have
had
a
chance
of
catching
them
before
they
got
clear
of
our
premises
.
<EOS>
As
it
was
,
I
went
back
to
set
a
-
going
a
younger
pair
of
legs
than
mine
.
<EOS>
Without
disturbing
anybody
,
Samuel
and
I
got
a
couple
of
guns
,
and
went
all
round
the
house
and
through
the
shrubbery
.
<EOS>
Having
made
sure
that
no
persons
were
lurking
about
anywhere
in
our
grounds
,
we
turned
back
.
<EOS>
Passing
over
the
walk
where
I
had
seen
the
shadow
,
I
now
noticed
,
for
the
first
time
,
a
little
bright
object
,
lying
on
the
clean
gravel
,
under
the
light
of
the
moon
.
<EOS>
Picking
the
object
up
,
I
discovered
it
was
a
small
bottle
,
containing
a
thick
sweet
-
smelling
liquor
,
as
black
as
ink
.
  
<EOS>
I
said
nothing
to
Samuel
.
<EOS>
But
,
remembering
what
Penelope
had
told
me
about
the
jugglers
,
and
the
pouring
of
the
little
pool
of
ink
into
the
palm
of
the
boy
's
hand
,
I
instantly
suspected
that
I
had
disturbed
the
three
Indians
,
lurking
about
the
house
,
and
bent
,
in
their
heathenish
way
,
on
discovering
the
whereabouts
of
the
Diamond
that
night
.
    
<EOS>
Here
,
for
one
moment
,
I
find
it
necessary
to
call
a
halt
.
  
<EOS>
On
summoning
up
my
own
recollections
 
and
on
getting
Penelope
to
help
me
,
by
consulting
her
journal
 
I
find
that
we
may
pass
pretty
rapidly
over
the
interval
between
Mr.
Franklin
Blake
's
arrival
and
Miss
Rachel
's
birthday
.
<EOS>
For
the
greater
part
of
that
time
the
days
passed
,
and
brought
nothing
with
them
worth
recording
.
<EOS>
With
your
good
leave
,
then
,
and
with
Penelope
's
help
,
I
shall
notice
certain
dates
only
in
this
place
;
reserving
to
myself
to
tell
the
story
day
by
day
,
once
more
,
as
soon
as
we
get
to
the
time
when
the
business
of
the
Moonstone
became
the
chief
business
of
everybody
in
our
house
.
  
<EOS>
This
said
,
we
may
now
go
on
again
 
beginning
,
of
course
,
with
the
bottle
of
sweet
-
smelling
ink
which
I
found
on
the
gravel
walk
at
night
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
next
morning
(
the
morning
of
the
twenty
-
sixth
)
<EOS>
I
showed
Mr.
Franklin
this
article
of
jugglery
,
and
told
him
what
I
have
already
told
you
.
<EOS>
His
opinion
was
,
not
only
that
the
Indians
had
been
lurking
about
after
the
Diamond
,
but
also
that
they
were
actually
foolish
enough
to
believe
in
their
own
magic
 
meaning
<EOS>
thereby
the
making
of
signs
on
a
boy
's
head
,
and
the
pouring
of
ink
into
a
boy
's
hand
,
and
then
expecting
him
to
see
persons
and
things
beyond
the
reach
of
human
vision
.
<EOS>
In
our
country
,
as
well
as
in
the
East
,
Mr.
Franklin
informed
me
,
there
are
people
who
practise
this
curious
hocus
-
pocus
(
without
the
ink
,
however
)
;
and
who
call
it
by
a
French
name
,
signifying
something
like
brightness
of
sight
.
<EOS>
"
Depend
upon
it
,
"
says
Mr.
Franklin
,
"
the
Indians
took
it
for
granted
that
we
should
keep
the
Diamond
here
;
and
they
brought
their
clairvoyant
boy
to
show
them
the
way
to
it
,
if
they
succeeded
in
getting
into
the
house
last
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
think
they
'll
try
again
,
sir
?
"
I
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
depends
,
"
says
Mr.
Franklin
,
"
on
what
the
boy
can
really
do
.
<EOS>
If
he
can
see
the
Diamond
through
the
iron
safe
of
the
bank
at
Frizinghall
,
we
shall
be
troubled
with
no
more
visits
from
the
Indians
for
the
present
.
<EOS>
If
he
ca
n't
,
we
shall
have
another
chance
of
catching
them
in
the
shrubbery
,
before
many
more
nights
are
over
our
heads
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
waited
pretty
confidently
for
that
latter
chance
;
but
,
strange
to
relate
,
it
never
came
.
  
<EOS>
Whether
the
jugglers
heard
,
in
the
town
,
of
Mr.
Franklin
having
been
seen
at
the
bank
,
and
drew
their
conclusions
accordingly
;
or
whether
the
boy
really
did
see
the
Diamond
where
the
Diamond
was
now
lodged
(
which
I
,
for
one
,
flatly
disbelieve
)
;
or
whether
,
after
all
,
it
was
a
mere
effect
of
chance
,
this
at
any
rate
is
the
plain
truth
 
not
the
ghost
of
an
Indian
came
near
the
house
again
,
through
the
weeks
that
passed
before
Miss
Rachel
's
birthday
.
<EOS>
The
jugglers
remained
in
and
about
the
town
plying
their
trade
;
and
Mr.
Franklin
and
I
remained
waiting
to
see
what
might
happen
,
and
resolute
not
to
put
the
rogues
on
their
guard
by
showing
our
suspicions
of
them
too
soon
.
<EOS>
With
this
report
of
the
proceedings
on
either
side
,
ends
all
that
I
have
to
say
about
the
Indians
for
the
present
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
twenty
-
ninth
of
the
month
,
Miss
Rachel
and
Mr.
Franklin
hit
on
a
new
method
of
working
their
way
together
through
the
time
which
might
otherwise
have
hung
heavy
on
their
hands
.
<EOS>
There
are
reasons
for
taking
particular
notice
here
of
the
occupation
that
amused
them
.
<EOS>
You
will
find
it
has
a
bearing
on
something
that
is
still
to
come
.
  
<EOS>
Gentlefolks
in
general
have
a
very
awkward
rock
ahead
in
life
 
<EOS>
the
rock
ahead
of
their
own
idleness
.
<EOS>
Their
lives
being
,
for
the
most
part
,
passed
in
looking
about
them
for
something
to
do
,
it
is
curious
to
see
 
especially
when
their
tastes
are
of
what
is
called
the
intellectual
sort
 
<EOS>
how
often
they
drift
blindfold
into
some
nasty
pursuit
.
<EOS>
Nine
times
out
of
ten
they
take
to
torturing
something
,
or
to
spoiling
something
 
<EOS>
and
they
firmly
believe
they
are
improving
their
minds
,
when
the
plain
truth
is
,
they
are
only
making
a
mess
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
I
have
seen
them
(
ladies
,
I
am
sorry
to
say
,
as
well
as
gentlemen
)
<EOS>
go
out
,
day
after
day
,
for
example
,
with
empty
pill
-
boxes
,
and
catch
newts
,
and
beetles
,
and
spiders
,
and
frogs
,
and
come
home
and
stick
pins
through
the
miserable
wretches
,
or
cut
them
up
,
without
a
pang
of
remorse
,
into
little
pieces
.
<EOS>
You
see
my
young
master
,
or
my
young
mistress
,
poring
over
one
of
their
spiders
'
insides
with
a
magnifying
-
glass
;
or
you
meet
one
of
their
frogs
walking
downstairs
without
his
head
 
and
when
you
wonder
what
this
cruel
nastiness
means
,
you
are
told
that
it
means
a
taste
in
my
young
master
or
my
young
mistress
for
natural
history
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
,
again
,
you
see
them
occupied
for
hours
together
in
spoiling
a
pretty
flower
with
pointed
instruments
,
out
of
a
stupid
curiosity
to
know
what
the
flower
is
made
of
.
<EOS>
Is
its
colour
any
prettier
,
or
its
scent
any
sweeter
,
when
you
DO
know
?
<EOS>
But
there
!
<EOS>
the
poor
souls
must
get
through
the
time
,
you
see
 
they
must
get
through
the
time
.
<EOS>
You
dabbled
in
nasty
mud
,
and
made
pies
,
when
you
were
a
child
;
and
you
dabble
in
nasty
science
,
and
dissect
spiders
,
and
spoil
flowers
,
when
you
grow
up
.
<EOS>
In
the
one
case
and
in
the
other
,
the
secret
of
it
is
,
that
you
have
got
nothing
to
think
of
in
your
poor
empty
head
,
and
nothing
to
do
with
your
poor
idle
hands
.
<EOS>
And
so
it
ends
in
your
spoiling
canvas
with
paints
,
and
making
a
smell
in
the
house
;
or
in
keeping
tadpoles
in
a
glass
box
full
of
dirty
water
,
and
turning
everybody
's
stomach
in
the
house
;
or
in
chipping
off
bits
of
stone
here
,
there
,
and
everywhere
,
and
dropping
grit
into
all
the
victuals
in
the
house
;
or
in
staining
your
fingers
in
the
pursuit
of
photography
,
and
doing
justice
without
mercy
on
everybody
's
face
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
It
often
falls
heavy
enough
,
no
doubt
,
on
people
who
are
really
obliged
to
get
their
living
,
to
be
forced
to
work
for
the
clothes
that
cover
them
,
the
roof
that
shelters
them
,
and
the
food
that
keeps
them
going
.
<EOS>
But
compare
the
hardest
day
's
work
you
ever
did
with
the
idleness
that
splits
flowers
and
pokes
its
way
into
spiders
'
stomachs
,
and
thank
your
stars
that
your
head
has
got
something
it
MUST
think
of
,
and
your
hands
something
that
they
MUST
do
.
  
<EOS>
As
for
Mr.
Franklin
and
Miss
Rachel
,
they
tortured
nothing
,
I
am
glad
to
say
.
<EOS>
They
simply
confined
themselves
to
making
a
mess
;
and
all
they
spoilt
,
to
do
them
justice
,
was
the
panelling
of
a
door
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Franklin
's
universal
genius
,
dabbling
in
everything
,
dabbled
in
what
he
called
"
decorative
painting
.
"
<EOS>
He
had
invented
,
he
informed
us
,
a
new
mixture
to
moisten
paint
with
,
which
he
described
as
a
"
vehicle
.
<EOS>
"
What
it
was
made
of
,
I
do
n't
know
.
<EOS>
What
it
did
,
I
can
tell
you
in
two
words
 
it
stank
.
<EOS>
Miss
Rachel
being
wild
<EOS>
to
try
her
hand
at
the
new
process
,
Mr.
Franklin
sent
to
London
for
the
materials
;
mixed
them
up
,
with
accompaniment
of
a
smell
which
made
the
very
dogs
sneeze
when
they
came
into
the
room
;
put
an
apron
and
a
bib
over
Miss
Rachel
's
gown
,
and
set
her
to
work
decorating
her
own
little
sitting
-
room
 
called
,
for
want
of
English
to
name
it
in
,
her
"
boudoir
.
"
<EOS>
They
began
with
the
inside
of
the
door
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Franklin
scraped
off
all
the
nice
varnish
with
pumice
-
stone
,
and
made
what
he
described
as
a
surface
to
work
on
.
<EOS>
Miss
Rachel
then
covered
the
surface
,
under
his
directions
and
with
his
help
,
with
patterns
and
devices
 
griffins
,
birds
,
flowers
,
cupids
,
and
such
like
 
copied
from
designs
made
by
a
famous
Italian
painter
,
whose
name
escapes
me
:
the
one
,
I
mean
,
who
stocked
the
world
with
Virgin
Maries
,
and
had
a
sweetheart
at
the
baker
's
.
<EOS>
Viewed
as
work
,
this
decoration
was
slow
to
do
,
and
dirty
to
deal
with
.
<EOS>
But
our
young
lady
and
gentleman
never
seemed
to
tire
of
it
.
<EOS>
When
they
were
not
riding
,
or
seeing
company
,
or
taking
their
meals
,
or
piping
their
songs
,
there
they
were
with
their
heads
together
,
as
busy
as
bees
,
spoiling
the
door
.
<EOS>
Who
was
the
poet
who
said
that
Satan
finds
some
mischief
still
for
idle
hands
to
do
?
<EOS>
If
he
had
occupied
my
place
in
the
family
,
and
had
seen
Miss
Rachel
with
her
brush
,
and
Mr.
Franklin
with
his
vehicle
,
he
could
have
written
nothing
truer
of
either
of
them
than
that
.
  
<EOS>
The
next
date
worthy
of
notice
is
Sunday
the
fourth
of
June
.
  
<EOS>
On
that
evening
we
,
in
the
servants
'
hall
,
debated
a
domestic
question
for
the
first
time
,
which
,
like
the
decoration
of
the
door
,
has
its
bearing
on
something
that
is
still
to
come
.
  
<EOS>
Seeing
the
pleasure
which
Mr.
Franklin
and
Miss
Rachel
took
in
each
other
's
society
,
and
noting
what
a
pretty
match
they
were
in
all
personal
respects
,
we
naturally
speculated
on
the
chance
of
their
putting
their
heads
together
with
other
objects
in
view
besides
the
ornamenting
of
a
door
.
<EOS>
Some
of
us
said
there
would
be
a
wedding
in
the
house
before
the
summer
was
over
.
<EOS>
Others
(
led
by
me
)
admitted
it
was
likely
enough
Miss
Rachel
might
be
married
;
but
we
doubted
(
for
reasons
which
will
presently
appear
)
whether
her
bridegroom
would
be
Mr.
Franklin
Blake
.
  
<EOS>
That
Mr.
Franklin
was
in
love
,
on
his
side
,
nobody
who
saw
and
heard
him
could
doubt
.
<EOS>
The
difficulty
was
to
fathom
Miss
Rachel
.
<EOS>
Let
me
do
myself
the
honour
of
making
you
acquainted
with
her
;
after
which
,
I
will
leave
you
to
fathom
for
yourself
 
if
you
can
.
  
<EOS>
My
young
lady
's
eighteenth
birthday
was
the
birthday
now
coming
,
on
the
twenty
-
first
of
June
.
<EOS>
If
you
happen
to
like
dark
women
(
who
,
I
am
informed
,
have
gone
out
of
fashion
latterly
in
the
gay
world
)
,
and
if
you
have
no
particular
prejudice
in
favour
of
size
,
I
answer
for
Miss
Rachel
as
one
of
the
prettiest
girls
your
eyes
ever
looked
on
.
<EOS>
She
was
small
and
slim
,
but
all
in
fine
proportion
from
top
to
toe
.
<EOS>
To
see
her
sit
down
,
to
see
her
get
up
,
and
specially
to
see
her
walk
,
was
enough
to
satisfy
any
man
in
his
senses
that
the
graces
of
her
figure
(
if
you
will
pardon
me
the
expression
)
were
in
her
flesh
and
not
in
her
clothes
.
<EOS>
Her
hair
was
the
blackest
I
ever
saw
.
<EOS>
Her
eyes
matched
her
hair
.
<EOS>
Her
nose
was
not
quite
large
enough
,
I
admit
.
<EOS>
Her
mouth
and
chin
were
(
to
quote
Mr.
Franklin
)
morsels
for
the
gods
;
and
her
complexion
(
on
the
same
undeniable
authority
)
was
as
warm
as
the
sun
itself
,
with
this
great
advantage
over
the
sun
,
that
it
was
always
in
nice
order
to
look
at
.
<EOS>
Add
to
the
foregoing
that
she
carried
her
head
as
upright
as
a
dart
,
in
a
dashing
,
spirited
,
thoroughbred
way
 
that
she
had
a
clear
voice
,
with
a
ring
of
the
right
metal
in
it
,
and
a
smile
that
began
very
prettily
in
her
eyes
before
it
got
to
her
lips
 
<EOS>
and
there
behold
the
portrait
of
her
,
to
the
best
of
my
painting
,
as
large
as
life
!
  
<EOS>
And
what
about
her
disposition
next
?
<EOS>
Had
this
charming
creature
no
faults
?
<EOS>
She
had
just
as
many
faults
as
you
have
,
ma'am
 
<EOS>
neither
more
nor
less
.
  
<EOS>
To
put
it
seriously
,
my
dear
pretty
Miss
Rachel
,
possessing
a
host
of
graces
and
attractions
,
had
one
defect
,
which
strict
impartiality
compels
me
to
acknowledge
.
<EOS>
She
was
unlike
most
other
girls
of
her
age
,
in
this
 
that
she
had
ideas
of
her
own
,
and
was
stiff
-
necked
enough
to
set
the
fashions
themselves
at
defiance
,
if
the
fashions
did
n't
suit
her
views
.
<EOS>
In
trifles
,
this
independence
of
hers
was
all
well
enough
;
but
in
matters
of
importance
,
it
carried
her
(
as
my
lady
thought
,
and
as
I
thought
)
too
far
.
<EOS>
She
judged
for
herself
,
as
few
women
of
twice
her
age
judge
in
general
;
never
asked
your
advice
;
never
told
you
beforehand
what
she
was
going
to
do
;
never
came
with
secrets
and
confidences
to
anybody
,
from
her
mother
downwards
.
<EOS>
In
little
things
and
great
,
with
people
she
loved
,
and
people
she
hated
(
and
she
did
both
with
equal
heartiness
)
,
Miss
Rachel
always
went
on
a
way
of
her
own
,
sufficient
for
herself
in
the
joys
and
sorrows
of
her
life
.
<EOS>
Over
and
over
again
I
have
heard
my
lady
say
,
"
Rachel
's
best
friend
and
Rachel
's
worst
enemy
are
,
one
and
the
other
 
Rachel
herself
.
"
  
<EOS>
Add
one
thing
more
to
this
,
and
I
have
done
.
  
<EOS>
With
all
her
secrecy
,
and
self
-
will
,
there
was
not
so
much
as
the
shadow
of
anything
false
in
her
.
<EOS>
I
never
remember
her
breaking
her
word
;
I
never
remember
her
saying
<EOS>
No
,
and
meaning
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
I
can
call
to
mind
,
in
her
childhood
,
more
than
one
occasion
when
the
good
little
soul
took
the
blame
,
and
suffered
the
punishment
,
for
some
fault
committed
by
a
playfellow
whom
she
loved
.
<EOS>
Nobody
ever
knew
her
to
confess
to
it
,
when
the
thing
was
found
out
,
and
she
was
charged
with
it
afterwards
.
<EOS>
But
nobody
ever
knew
her
to
lie
about
it
,
either
.
<EOS>
She
looked
you
straight
in
the
face
,
and
shook
her
little
saucy
head
,
and
said
plainly
,
"
I
wo
n't
tell
you
!
"
<EOS>
Punished
again
for
this
,
she
would
own
to
being
sorry
for
saying
"
wo
n't
;
"
but
,
bread
and
water
notwithstanding
,
she
never
told
you
.
<EOS>
Self
-
willed
 
devilish
self
-
willed
<EOS>
sometimes
 
I
grant
;
but
the
finest
creature
,
nevertheless
,
that
ever
walked
the
ways
of
this
lower
world
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
you
think
you
see
a
certain
contradiction
here
?
<EOS>
In
that
case
,
a
word
in
your
ear
.
<EOS>
Study
your
wife
closely
,
for
the
next
four
-
and
-
twenty
hours
.
<EOS>
If
your
good
lady
does
n't
exhibit
something
in
the
shape
of
a
contradiction
in
that
time
,
Heaven
help
you
!
 
<EOS>
you
have
married
a
monster
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
now
brought
you
acquainted
with
Miss
Rachel
,
which
you
will
find
puts
us
face
to
face
,
next
,
with
the
question
of
that
young
lady
's
matrimonial
views
.
  
<EOS>
On
June
the
twelfth
,
an
invitation
from
my
mistress
was
sent
to
a
gentleman
in
London
,
to
come
and
help
to
keep
Miss
Rachel
's
birthday
.
<EOS>
This
was
the
fortunate
individual
on
whom
I
believed
her
heart
to
be
privately
set
!
<EOS>
Like
Mr.
Franklin
,
he
was
a
cousin
of
hers
.
<EOS>
His
name
was
Mr.
Godfrey
Ablewhite
.
  
<EOS>
My
lady
's
second
sister
(
do
n't
be
alarmed
;
we
are
not
going
very
deep
into
family
matters
this
time
)
 
<EOS>
my
lady
's
second
sister
,
I
say
,
had
a
disappointment
in
love
;
and
taking
a
husband
afterwards
,
on
the
neck
or
nothing
principle
,
made
what
they
call
a
misalliance
.
<EOS>
There
was
terrible
work
in
the
family
when
the
Honourable
Caroline
insisted
on
marrying
plain
Mr.
Ablewhite
,
the
banker
at
Frizinghall
.
<EOS>
He
was
very
rich
and
very
respectable
,
and
he
begot
a
prodigious
large
family
 
all
in
his
favour
,
so
far
.
<EOS>
But
he
had
presumed
to
raise
himself
from
a
low
station
in
the
world
 
and
that
was
against
him
.
<EOS>
However
,
Time
and
the
progress
of
modern
enlightenment
put
things
right
;
and
the
misalliance
passed
muster
very
well
.
<EOS>
We
are
all
getting
liberal
now
;
and
(
provided
you
can
scratch
me
,
if
I
scratch
you
)
<EOS>
what
do
I
care
,
in
or
out
of
Parliament
,
whether
you
are
a
Dustman
or
a
Duke
?
<EOS>
That
's
the
modern
way
of
looking
at
it
 
<EOS>
and
I
keep
up
with
the
modern
way
.
<EOS>
The
Ablewhites
lived
in
a
fine
house
and
grounds
,
a
little
out
of
Frizinghall
.
<EOS>
Very
worthy
people
,
and
greatly
respected
in
the
neighbourhood
.
<EOS>
We
shall
not
be
much
troubled
with
them
in
these
pages
 
excepting
Mr.
Godfrey
,
who
was
Mr.
Ablewhite
's
second
son
,
and
who
must
take
his
proper
place
here
,
if
you
please
,
for
Miss
Rachel
's
sake
.
  
<EOS>
With
all
his
brightness
and
cleverness
and
general
good
qualities
,
Mr.
Franklin
's
chance
of
topping
Mr.
Godfrey
in
our
young
lady
's
estimation
was
,
in
my
opinion
,
a
very
poor
chance
indeed
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
first
place
,
Mr.
Godfrey
was
,
in
point
of
size
,
the
finest
man
by
far
of
the
two
.
<EOS>
He
stood
over
six
feet
high
;
he
had
a
beautiful
red
and
white
colour
;
a
smooth
round
face
,
shaved
as
bare
as
your
hand
;
and
a
head
of
lovely
long
flaxen
hair
,
falling
negligently
over
the
poll
of
his
neck
.
<EOS>
But
why
do
I
try
to
give
you
this
personal
description
of
him
?
<EOS>
If
you
ever
subscribed
to
a
Ladies
'
Charity
in
London
,
you
know
Mr.
Godfrey
Ablewhite
as
well
as
I
do
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
barrister
by
profession
;
a
ladies
'
man
by
temperament
;
and
a
good
Samaritan
by
choice
.
<EOS>
Female
benevolence
and
female
destitution
could
do
nothing
without
him
.
<EOS>
Maternal
societies
for
confining
poor
women
;
Magdalen
societies
for
rescuing
poor
women
;
strong
-
minded
societies
for
putting
poor
women
into
poor
men
's
places
,
and
leaving
the
men
to
shift
for
themselves
;
 
he
was
vice
-
president
,
manager
,
referee
to
them
all
.
<EOS>
Wherever
there
was
a
table
with
a
committee
of
ladies
sitting
round
it
in
council
there
was
Mr.
Godfrey
at
the
bottom
of
the
board
,
keeping
the
temper
of
the
committee
,
and
leading
the
dear
creatures
along
the
thorny
ways
of
business
,
hat
in
hand
.
<EOS>
I
do
suppose
this
was
the
most
accomplished
philanthropist
(
on
a
small
independence
)
that
England
ever
produced
.
<EOS>
As
a
speaker
at
charitable
meetings
the
like
of
him
for
drawing
your
tears
and
your
money
was
not
easy
to
find
.
<EOS>
He
was
quite
a
public
character
.
<EOS>
The
last
time
I
was
in
London
,
my
mistress
gave
me
two
treats
.
<EOS>
She
sent
me
to
the
theatre
to
see
a
dancing
woman
who
was
all
the
rage
;
and
she
sent
me
to
Exeter
Hall
to
hear
Mr.
Godfrey
.
<EOS>
The
lady
did
it
,
with
a
band
of
music
.
<EOS>
The
gentleman
did
it
,
with
a
handkerchief
and
a
glass
of
water
.
<EOS>
Crowds
at
the
performance
with
the
legs
.
<EOS>
Ditto
at
the
performance
with
the
tongue
.
<EOS>
And
with
all
this
,
the
sweetest
tempered
person
(
I
allude
to
Mr.
Godfrey
)
 
the
simplest
and
pleasantest
and
easiest
to
please
 
you
ever
met
with
.
<EOS>
He
loved
everybody
.
<EOS>
And
everybody
loved
HIM
.
<EOS>
What
chance
had
Mr.
Franklin
 
<EOS>
what
chance
had
anybody
of
average
reputation
and
capacities
 
against
such
a
man
as
this
?
  
<EOS>
On
the
fourteenth
,
came
Mr.
Godfrey
's
answer
.
  
<EOS>
He
accepted
my
mistress
's
invitation
,
from
the
Wednesday
of
the
birthday
to
the
evening
of
Friday
 
when
his
duties
to
the
Ladies
'
Charities
would
oblige
him
to
return
to
town
.
<EOS>
He
also
enclosed
a
copy
of
verses
on
what
he
elegantly
called
his
cousin
's
"
natal
day
.
"
<EOS>
Miss
Rachel
,
I
was
informed
,
joined
Mr.
Franklin
in
making
fun
of
the
verses
at
dinner
;
and
Penelope
,
who
was
all
on
Mr.
Franklin
's
side
,
asked
me
,
in
great
triumph
,
what
I
thought
of
that
.
"
<EOS>
Miss
Rachel
has
led
you
off
on
a
false
scent
,
my
dear
,
"
I
replied
;
"
but
MY
nose
is
not
so
easily
mystified
.
<EOS>
Wait
till
Mr.
Ablewhite
's
verses
are
followed
by
Mr.
Ablewhite
himself
.
"
  
<EOS>
My
daughter
replied
,
that
Mr.
Franklin
might
strike
in
,
and
try
his
luck
,
before
the
verses
were
followed
by
the
poet
.
<EOS>
In
favour
of
this
view
,
I
must
acknowledge
that
Mr.
Franklin
left
no
chance
untried
of
winning
Miss
Rachel
's
good
graces
.
  
<EOS>
Though
one
of
the
most
inveterate
smokers
I
ever
met
with
,
he
gave
up
his
cigar
,
because
she
said
,
one
day
,
she
hated
the
stale
smell
of
it
in
his
clothes
.
<EOS>
He
slept
so
badly
,
after
this
effort
of
self
-
denial
,
for
want
of
the
composing
effect
of
the
tobacco
to
which
he
was
used
,
and
came
down
morning
after
morning
looking
so
haggard
and
worn
,
that
Miss
Rachel
herself
begged
him
to
take
to
his
cigars
again
.
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
he
would
take
to
nothing
again
that
could
cause
her
a
moment
's
annoyance
;
he
would
fight
it
out
resolutely
,
and
get
back
his
sleep
,
sooner
or
later
,
by
main
force
of
patience
in
waiting
for
it
.
<EOS>
Such
devotion
as
this
,
you
may
say
(
as
some
of
them
said
downstairs
)
,
could
never
fail
of
producing
the
right
effect
on
Miss
Rachel
 
backed
up
,
too
,
as
it
was
,
by
the
decorating
work
every
day
on
the
door
.
<EOS>
All
very
well
 
<EOS>
but
she
had
a
photograph
of
Mr.
Godfrey
in
her
bed
-
room
;
represented
speaking
at
a
public
meeting
,
with
all
his
hair
blown
out
by
the
breath
of
his
own
eloquence
,
and
his
eyes
,
most
lovely
,
charming
the
money
out
of
your
pockets
.
<EOS>
What
do
you
say
to
that
?
<EOS>
Every
morning
 
as
Penelope
herself
owned
to
me
 
there
was
the
man
whom
the
women
could
n't
do
without
,
looking
on
,
in
effigy
,
while
Miss
Rachel
was
having
her
hair
combed
.
<EOS>
He
would
be
looking
on
,
in
reality
,
before
long
 
<EOS>
that
was
my
opinion
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
June
the
sixteenth
brought
an
event
which
made
Mr.
Franklin
's
chance
look
,
to
my
mind
,
a
worse
chance
than
ever
.
  
<EOS>
A
strange
gentleman
,
speaking
English
with
a
foreign
accent
,
came
that
morning
to
the
house
,
and
asked
to
see
Mr.
Franklin
Blake
on
business
.
<EOS>
The
business
could
not
possibly
have
been
connected
with
the
Diamond
,
for
these
two
reasons
 
first
,
that
Mr.
Franklin
told
me
nothing
about
it
;
secondly
,
that
he
communicated
it
(
when
the
gentleman
had
gone
,
as
I
suppose
)
to
my
lady
.
<EOS>
She
probably
hinted
something
about
it
next
to
her
daughter
.
<EOS>
At
any
rate
,
Miss
Rachel
was
reported
to
have
said
some
severe
things
to
Mr.
Franklin
,
at
the
piano
that
evening
,
about
the
people
he
had
lived
among
,
and
the
principles
he
had
adopted
in
foreign
parts
.
<EOS>
The
next
day
,
for
the
first
time
,
nothing
was
done
towards
the
decoration
of
the
door
.
<EOS>
I
suspect
some
imprudence
of
Mr.
Franklin
's
on
the
Continent
 
with
a
woman
or
a
debt
at
the
bottom
of
it
 
had
followed
him
to
England
.
<EOS>
But
that
is
all
guesswork
.
<EOS>
In
this
case
,
not
only
Mr.
Franklin
,
but
my
lady
too
,
for
a
wonder
,
left
me
in
the
dark
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
seventeenth
,
to
all
appearance
,
the
cloud
passed
away
again
.
<EOS>
They
returned
to
their
decorating
work
on
the
door
,
and
seemed
to
be
as
good
friends
as
ever
.
<EOS>
If
Penelope
was
to
be
believed
,
Mr.
Franklin
had
seized
the
opportunity
of
the
reconciliation
to
make
an
offer
to
Miss
Rachel
,
and
had
neither
been
accepted
nor
refused
.
<EOS>
My
girl
was
sure
(
from
signs
and
tokens
which
I
need
not
trouble
you
with
)
that
her
young
mistress
had
fought
Mr.
Franklin
off
by
declining
to
believe
that
he
was
in
earnest
,
and
had
then
secretly
regretted
treating
him
in
that
way
afterwards
.
<EOS>
Though
Penelope
was
admitted
to
more
familiarity
with
her
young
mistress
than
maids
generally
are
 
for
the
two
had
been
almost
brought
up
together
as
children
 
<EOS>
still
I
knew
Miss
Rachel
's
reserved
character
too
well
to
believe
that
she
would
show
her
mind
to
anybody
in
this
way
.
<EOS>
What
my
daughter
told
me
,
on
the
present
occasion
,
was
,
as
I
suspected
,
more
what
she
wished
than
what
she
really
knew
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
nineteenth
another
event
happened
.
<EOS>
We
had
the
doctor
in
the
house
professionally
.
<EOS>
He
was
summoned
to
prescribe
for
a
person
whom
I
have
had
occasion
to
present
to
you
in
these
pages
 
our
second
housemaid
,
Rosanna
Spearman
.
  
<EOS>
This
poor
girl
 
who
had
puzzled
me
,
as
you
know
already
,
at
the
Shivering
Sand
 
puzzled
me
more
than
once
again
,
in
the
interval
time
of
which
I
am
now
writing
.
<EOS>
Penelope
's
notion
that
her
fellow
-
servant
was
in
love
with
Mr.
Franklin
(
which
my
daughter
,
by
my
orders
,
kept
strictly
secret
)
seemed
to
be
just
as
absurd
as
ever
.
<EOS>
But
I
must
own
that
what
I
myself
saw
,
and
what
my
daughter
saw
also
,
of
our
second
housemaid
's
conduct
,
began
to
look
mysterious
,
to
say
the
least
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
For
example
,
the
girl
constantly
put
herself
in
Mr.
Franklin
's
way
 
very
slyly
and
quietly
,
but
she
did
it
.
<EOS>
He
took
about
as
much
notice
of
her
as
he
took
of
the
cat
;
it
never
seemed
to
occur
to
him
to
waste
a
look
on
Rosanna
's
plain
face
.
<EOS>
The
poor
thing
's
appetite
,
never
much
,
fell
away
dreadfully
;
and
her
eyes
in
the
morning
showed
plain
signs
of
waking
and
crying
at
night
.
<EOS>
One
day
Penelope
made
an
awkward
discovery
,
which
we
hushed
up
on
the
spot
.
<EOS>
She
caught
Rosanna
at
Mr.
Franklin
's
dressing
-
table
,
secretly
removing
a
rose
which
Miss
Rachel
had
given
him
to
wear
in
his
button
-
hole
,
and
putting
another
rose
like
it
,
of
her
own
picking
,
in
its
place
.
<EOS>
She
was
,
after
that
,
once
or
twice
impudent
to
me
,
when
I
gave
her
a
well
-
meant
general
hint
to
be
careful
in
her
conduct
;
and
,
worse
still
<EOS>
,
she
was
not
over
-
respectful
now
,
on
the
few
occasions
when
Miss
Rachel
accidentally
spoke
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
My
lady
noticed
the
change
,
and
asked
me
what
I
thought
about
it
.
<EOS>
I
tried
to
screen
the
girl
by
answering
that
I
thought
she
was
out
of
health
;
and
it
ended
in
the
doctor
being
sent
for
,
as
already
mentioned
,
on
the
nineteenth
.
<EOS>
He
said
it
was
her
nerves
,
and
doubted
if
she
was
fit
for
service
.
<EOS>
My
lady
offered
to
remove
her
for
change
of
air
to
one
of
our
farms
,
inland
.
<EOS>
She
begged
and
prayed
,
with
the
tears
in
her
eyes
,
to
be
let
to
stop
;
and
,
in
an
evil
hour
,
I
advised
my
lady
to
try
her
for
a
little
longer
.
<EOS>
As
the
event
proved
,
and
as
you
will
soon
see
,
this
was
the
worst
advice
I
could
have
given
.
<EOS>
If
I
could
only
have
looked
a
little
way
into
the
future
,
I
would
have
taken
Rosanna
Spearman
out
of
the
house
,
then
and
there
,
with
my
own
hand
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
twentieth
,
there
came
a
note
from
Mr.
Godfrey
.
<EOS>
He
had
arranged
to
stop
at
Frizinghall
that
night
,
having
occasion
to
consult
his
father
on
business
.
<EOS>
On
the
afternoon
of
the
next
day
,
he
and
his
two
eldest
sisters
would
ride
over
to
us
on
horseback
,
in
good
time
before
dinner
.
<EOS>
An
elegant
little
casket
in
China
accompanied
the
note
,
presented
to
Miss
Rachel
,
with
her
cousin
's
love
and
best

<EOS>
Mr.
Franklin
had
only
given
her
a
plain
locket
not
worth
half
the
money
.
<EOS>
My
daughter
Penelope
,
nevertheless
 
such
is
the
obstinacy
of
women
 
still
backed
him
to
win
.
  
<EOS>
Thanks
be
to
Heaven
,
we
have
arrived
at
the
eve
of
the
birthday
at
last
!
<EOS>
You
will
own
,
I
think
,
that
I
have
got
you
over
the
ground
this
time
,
without
much
loitering
by
the
way
.
<EOS>
Cheer
up
!
<EOS>
I
'll
ease
you
with
another
new
chapter
here
 
and
,
what
is
more
,
that
chapter
shall
take
you
straight
into
the
thick
of
the
story
.
    
<EOS>
June
twenty
-
first
,
the
day
of
the
birthday
,
was
cloudy
and
unsettled
at
sunrise
,
but
towards
noon
it
cleared
up
bravely
.
  
<EOS>
We
,
in
the
servants
'
hall
,
began
this
happy
anniversary
,
as
usual
,
by
offering
our
little
presents
to
Miss
Rachel
,
with
the
regular
speech
delivered
annually
by
me
as
the
chief
.
<EOS>
I
follow
the
plan
adopted
by
the
Queen
in
opening
Parliament
 
namely
,
the
plan
of
saying
much
the
same
thing
regularly
every
year
.
<EOS>
Before
it
is
delivered
,
my
speech
(
like
the
Queen
's
)
is
looked
for
as
eagerly
as
if
nothing
of
the
kind
had
ever
been
heard
before
.
<EOS>
When
it
is
delivered
,
and
turns
out
not
to
be
the
novelty
anticipated
,
though
they
grumble
a
little
,
they
look
forward
hopefully
to
something
newer
next
year
.
<EOS>
An
easy
people
to
govern
,
in
the
Parliament
and
in
the
Kitchen
 
<EOS>
that
's
the
moral
of
it
.
<EOS>
After
breakfast
,
Mr.
Franklin
and
I
had
a
private
conference
on
the
subject
of
the
Moonstone
 
<EOS>
the
time
having
now
come
for
removing
it
from
the
bank
at
Frizinghall
,
and
placing
it
in
Miss
Rachel
's
own
hands
.
  
<EOS>
Whether
he
had
been
trying
to
make
love
to
his
cousin
again
,
and
had
got
a
rebuff
 
or
whether
his
broken
rest
,
night
after
night
,
was
aggravating
the
queer
contradictions
and
uncertainties
in
his
character
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
.
<EOS>
But
certain
it
is
,
that
Mr.
Franklin
failed
to
show
himself
at
his
best
on
the
morning
of
the
birthday
.
<EOS>
He
was
in
twenty
different
minds
about
the
Diamond
in
as
many
minutes
.
<EOS>
For
my
part
,
I
stuck
fast
by
the
plain
facts
as
we
knew
them
.
<EOS>
Nothing
had
happened
to
justify
us
in
alarming
my
lady
on
the
subject
of
the
jewel
;
and
nothing
could
alter
the
legal
obligation
that
now
lay
on
Mr.
Franklin
to
put
it
in
his
cousin
's
possession
.
<EOS>
That
was
my
view
of
the
matter
;
and
,
twist
and
turn
it
as
he
might
,
he
was
forced
in
the
end
to
make
it
his
view
too
.
<EOS>
We
arranged
that
he
was
to
ride
over
,
after
lunch
,
to
Frizinghall
,
and
bring
the
Diamond
back
,
with
Mr.
Godfrey
and
the
two
young
ladies
,
in
all
probability
,
to
keep
him
company
on
the
way
home
again
.
  
<EOS>
This
settled
,
our
young
gentleman
went
back
to
Miss
Rachel
.
  
<EOS>
They
consumed
the
whole
morning
,
and
part
of
the
afternoon
,
in
the
everlasting
business
of
decorating
the
door
,
Penelope
standing
by
to
mix
the
colours
,
as
directed
;
and
my
lady
,
as
luncheon
time
drew
near
,
going
in
and
out
of
the
room
,
with
her
handkerchief
to
her
nose
(
for
they
used
a
deal
of
Mr.
Franklin
's
vehicle
that
day
)
,
and
trying
vainly
to
get
the
two
artists
away
from
their
work
.
<EOS>
It
was
three
o'clock
before
they
took
off
their
aprons
,
and
released
Penelope
(
much
the
worse
for
the
vehicle
)
,
and
cleaned
themselves
of
their
mess
.
<EOS>
But
they
had
done
what
they
wanted
 
they
had
finished
the
door
on
the
birthday
,
and
proud
enough
they
were
of
it
.
<EOS>
The
griffins
,
cupids
,
and
so
on
,
were
,
I
must
own
,
most
beautiful
to
behold
;
though
so
many
in
number
,
so
entangled
in
flowers
and
devices
,
and
so
topsy
-
turvy
in
their
actions
and
attitudes
,
that
you
felt
them
unpleasantly
in
your
head
for
hours
after
you
had
done
with
the
pleasure
of
looking
at
them
.
<EOS>
If
I
add
that
Penelope
ended
her
part
of
the
morning
's
work
by
being
sick
in
the
back
-
kitchen
,
it
is
in
no
unfriendly
spirit
towards
the
vehicle
.
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
no
!
<EOS>
It
left
off
stinking
when
it
dried
;
and
if
Art
requires
these
sort
of
sacrifices
 
though
the
girl
is
my
own
daughter
 
<EOS>
I
say
,
let
Art
have
them
!
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Franklin
snatched
a
morsel
from
the
luncheon
-
table
,
and
rode
off
to
Frizinghall
 
to
escort
his
cousins
,
as
he
told
my
lady
.
<EOS>
To
fetch
the
Moonstone
,
as
was
privately
known
to
himself
and
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
This
being
one
of
the
high
festivals
on
which
I
took
my
place
at
the
side
-
board
,
in
command
of
the
attendance
at
table
,
I
had
plenty
to
occupy
my
mind
while
Mr.
Franklin
was
away
.
<EOS>
Having
seen
to
the
wine
,
and
reviewed
my
men
and
women
who
were
to
wait
at
dinner
,
I
retired
to
collect
myself
before
the
company
came
.
<EOS>
A
whiff
of
 
you
know
what
,
and
a
turn
at
a
certain
book
which
I
have
had
occasion
to
mention
in
these
pages
,
composed
me
,
body
and
mind
.
<EOS>
I
was
aroused
from
what
I
am
inclined
to
think
must
have
been
,
not
a
nap
,
but
a
reverie
,
by
the
clatter
of
horses
'
hoofs
outside
;
and
,
going
to
the
door
,
received
a
cavalcade
comprising
Mr.
Franklin
and
his
three
cousins
,
escorted
by
one
of
old
Mr.
Ablewhite
's
grooms
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Godfrey
struck
me
,
strangely
enough
,
as
being
like
Mr.
Franklin
in
this
respect
 
that
he
did
not
seem
to
be
in
his
customary
spirits
.
<EOS>
He
kindly
shook
hands
with
me
as
usual
,
and
was
most
politely
glad
to
see
his
old
friend
Betteredge
wearing
so
well
.
<EOS>
But
there
was
a
sort
of
cloud
over
him
,
which
I
could
n't
at
all
account
for
;
and
when
I
asked
how
he
had
found
his
father
in
health
,
he
answered
rather
shortly
,
"
Much
as
usual
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
However
,
the
two
Miss
Ablewhites
were
cheerful
enough
for
twenty
,
which
more
than
restored
the
balance
.
<EOS>
They
were
nearly
as
big
as
their
brother
;
spanking
,
yellow
-
haired
,
rosy
lasses
,
overflowing
with
super
-
abundant
flesh
and
blood
;
bursting
from
head
to
foot
with
health
and
spirits
.
<EOS>
The
legs
of
the
poor
horses
trembled
with
carrying
them
;
and
when
they
jumped
from
their
saddles
(
without
waiting
to
be
helped
)
,
I
declare
they
bounced
on
the
ground
as
if
they
were
made
of
india
-
rubber
.
<EOS>
Everything
the
Miss
Ablewhites
said
began
with
a
large
O
;
everything
they
did
was
done
with
a
bang
;
and
they
giggled
and
screamed
,
in
season
and
out
of
season
,
on
the
smallest
provocation
.
<EOS>
Bouncers
 
<EOS>
that
's
what
I
call
them
.
  
<EOS>
Under
cover
of
the
noise
made
by
the
young
ladies
,
I
had
an
opportunity
of
saying
a
private
word
to
Mr.
Franklin
in
the
hall
.
  
<EOS>
"
Have
you
got
the
Diamond
safe
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
nodded
,
and
tapped
the
breast
-
pocket
of
his
coat
.
  
<EOS>
"
Have
you
seen
anything
of
the
Indians
?
"
  
"
Not
a
glimpse
.
"
<EOS>
With
that
answer
,
he
asked
for
my
lady
,
and
,
hearing
she
was
in
the
small
drawing
-
room
,
went
there
straight
.
<EOS>
The
bell
rang
,
before
he
had
been
a
minute
in
the
room
,
and
Penelope
was
sent
to
tell
Miss
Rachel
that
Mr.
Franklin
Blake
wanted
to
speak
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
Crossing
the
hall
,
about
half
an
hour
afterwards
,
I
was
brought
to
a
sudden
standstill
by
an
outbreak
of
screams
from
the
small
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
say
I
was
at
all
alarmed
;
for
I
recognised
in
the
screams
the
favourite
large
O
of
the
Miss
Ablewhites
.
<EOS>
However
,
I
went
in
(
on
pretence
of
asking
for
instructions
about
the
dinner
)
to
discover
whether
anything
serious
had
really
happened
.
  
<EOS>
There
stood
Miss
Rachel
at
the
table
,
like
a
person
fascinated
,
with
the
Colonel
's
unlucky
Diamond
in
her
hand
.
<EOS>
There
,
on
either
side
of
her
,
knelt
the
two
Bouncers
,
devouring
the
jewel
with
their
eyes
,
and
screaming
with
ecstasy
every
time
it
flashed
on
them
in
a
new
light
.
<EOS>
There
,
at
the
opposite
side
of
the
table
,
stood
Mr.
Godfrey
,
clapping
his
hands
like
a
large
child
,
and
singing
out
softly
,
"
Exquisite
!
exquisite
!
"
<EOS>
There
sat
Mr.
Franklin
in
a
chair
by
the
book
-
case
,
tugging
at
his
beard
,
and
looking
anxiously
towards
the
window
.
<EOS>
And
there
,
at
the
window
,
stood
the
object
he
was
contemplating
 
my
lady
,
having
the
extract
from
the
Colonel
's
Will
in
her
hand
,
and
keeping
her
back
turned
on
the
whole
of
the
company
.
  
<EOS>
She
faced
me
,
when
I
asked
for
my
instructions
;
and
I
saw
the
family
frown
gathering
over
her
eyes
,
and
the
family
temper
twitching
at
the
corners
of
her
mouth
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
to
my
room
in
half
an
hour
,
"
she
answered
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
have
something
to
say
to
you
then
.
"
  
<EOS>
With
those
words
she
went
out
.
<EOS>
It
was
plain
enough
that
she
was
posed
by
the
same
difficulty
which
had
posed
Mr.
Franklin
and
me
in
our
conference
at
the
Shivering
Sand
.
<EOS>
Was
the
legacy
of
the
Moonstone
a
proof
that
she
had
treated
her
brother
with
cruel
injustice
?
<EOS>
or
was
it
a
proof
that
he
was
worse
than
the
worst
she
had
ever
thought
of
him
?
<EOS>
Serious
questions
those
for
my
lady
to
determine
,
while
her
daughter
,
innocent
of
all
knowledge
of
the
Colonel
's
character
,
stood
there
with
the
Colonel
's
birthday
gift
in
her
hand
.
  
<EOS>
Before
I
could
leave
the
room
in
my
turn
,
Miss
Rachel
,
always
considerate
to
the
old
servant
who
had
been
in
the
house
when
she
was
born
,
stopped
me
.
<EOS>
"
Look
,
Gabriel
!
"
she
said
,
and
flashed
the
jewel
before
my
eyes
in
a
ray
of
sunlight
that
poured
through
the
window
.
  
<EOS>
Lord
bless
us
!
<EOS>
it
WAS
a
Diamond
!
<EOS>
As
large
,
or
nearly
,
as
a
plover
's
egg
!
<EOS>
The
light
that
streamed
from
it
was
like
the
light
of
the
harvest
moon
.
<EOS>
When
you
looked
down
into
the
stone
,
you
looked
into
a
yellow
deep
that
drew
your
eyes
into
it
so
that
they
saw
nothing
else
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
unfathomable
;
this
jewel
,
that
you
could
hold
between
your
finger
and
thumb
,
seemed
unfathomable
as
the
heavens
themselves
.
<EOS>
We
set
it
in
the
sun
,
and
then
shut
the
light
out
of
the
room
,
and
it
shone
awfully
out
of
the
depths
of
its
own
brightness
,
with
a
moony
gleam
,
in
the
dark
.
<EOS>
No
wonder
<EOS>
Miss
Rachel
was
fascinated
:
no
wonder
her
cousins
screamed
.
<EOS>
The
Diamond
laid
such
a
hold
on
ME
that
I
burst
out
with
as
large
an
"
O
"
as
the
Bouncers
themselves
.
<EOS>
The
only
one
of
us
who
kept
his
senses
was
Mr.
Godfrey
.
<EOS>
He
put
an
arm
round
each
of
his
sister
's
waists
,
and
,
looking
compassionately
backwards
and
forwards
between
the
Diamond
and
me
,
said
,
"
Carbon
Betteredge
!
<EOS>
mere
carbon
,
my
good
friend
,
after
all
!
"
  
<EOS>
His
object
,
I
suppose
,
was
to
instruct
me
.
<EOS>
All
he
did
,
however
,
was
to
remind
me
of
the
dinner
.
<EOS>
I
hobbled
off
to
my
army
of
waiters
downstairs
.
<EOS>
As
I
went
out
,
Mr.
Godfrey
said
,
"
Dear
old
Betteredge
,
I
have
the
truest
regard
for
him
!
"
<EOS>
He
was
embracing
his
sisters
,
and
ogling
Miss
Rachel
,
while
he
honoured
me
with
that
testimony
of
affection
.
<EOS>
Something
like
a
stock
of
love
to
draw
on
THERE
!
<EOS>
Mr.
Franklin
was
a
perfect
savage
by
comparison
with
him
.
  
<EOS>
At
the
end
of
half
an
hour
,
I
presented
myself
,
as
directed
,
in
my
lady
's
room
.
  
<EOS>
What
passed
between
my
mistress
and
me
,
on
this
occasion
,
was
,
in
the
main
,
a
repetition
of
what
had
passed
between
Mr.
Franklin
and
me
at
the
Shivering
Sand
 
with
this
difference
,
that
I
took
care
to
keep
my
own
counsel
about
the
jugglers
,
seeing
that
nothing
had
happened
to
justify
me
in
alarming
my
lady
on
this
head
.
<EOS>
When
I
received
my
dismissal
,
I
could
see
that
she
took
the
blackest
view
possible
of
the
Colonel
's
motives
,
and
that
she
was
bent
on
getting
the
Moonstone
out
of
her
daughter
's
possession
at
the
first
opportunity
.
  
<EOS>
On
my
way
back
to
my
own
part
of
the
house
,
I
was
encountered
by
Mr.
Franklin
.
<EOS>
He
wanted
to
know
if
I
had
seen
anything
of
his
cousin
Rachel
.
<EOS>
I
had
seen
nothing
of
her
.
<EOS>
Could
I
tell
him
where
his
cousin
Godfrey
was
?
<EOS>
I
did
n't
know
;
but
I
began
to
suspect
that
cousin
Godfrey
might
not
be
far
away
from
cousin
Rachel
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Franklin
's
suspicions
apparently
took
the
same
turn
.
<EOS>
He
tugged
hard
at
his
beard
,
and
went
and
shut
himself
up
in
the
library
with
a
bang
of
the
door
that
had
a
world
of
meaning
in
it
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
interrupted
no
more
in
the
business
of
preparing
for
the
birthday
dinner
till
it
was
time
for
me
to
smarten
myself
up
for
receiving
the
company
.
<EOS>
Just
as
I
had
got
my
white
waistcoat
on
,
Penelope
presented
herself
at
my
toilet
,
on
pretence
of
brushing
what
little
hair
I
have
got
left
,
and
improving
the
tie
of
my
white
cravat
.
<EOS>
My
girl
was
in
high
spirits
,
and
I
saw
she
had
something
to
say
to
me
.
<EOS>
She
gave
me
a
kiss
on
the
top
of
my
bald
head
,
and
whispered
,
<EOS>
"
News
for
you
,
father
!
<EOS>
Miss
Rachel
has
refused
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Who
's
"
HIM
"
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
ladies
'
committee
-
man
,
father
,
"
says
Penelope
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
nasty
sly
fellow
!
<EOS>
I
hate
him
for
trying
to
supplant
Mr.
Franklin
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
If
I
had
had
breath
enough
,
I
should
certainly
have
protested
against
this
indecent
way
of
speaking
of
an
eminent
philanthropic
character
.
<EOS>
But
my
daughter
happened
to
be
improving
the
tie
of
my
cravat
at
that
moment
,
and
the
whole
strength
of
her
feelings
found
its
way
into
her
fingers
.
<EOS>
I
never
was
more
nearly
strangled
in
my
life
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
saw
him
take
her
away
alone
into
the
rose
-
garden
,
"
says
Penelope
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
I
waited
behind
the
holly
to
see
how
they
came
back
.
<EOS>
They
had
gone
out
arm
-
in
-
arm
,
both
laughing
.
<EOS>
They
came
back
,
walking
separate
,
as
grave
as
grave
could
be
,
and
looking
straight
away
from
each
other
in
a
manner
which
there
was
no
mistaking
.
<EOS>
I
never
was
more
delighted
,
father
,
in
my
life
!
<EOS>
There
's
one
woman
in
the
world
who
can
resist
Mr.
Godfrey
Ablewhite
,
at
any
rate
;
and
,
if
I
was
a
lady
,
I
should
be
another
!
"
  
<EOS>
Here
I
should
have
protested
again
.
<EOS>
But
my
daughter
had
got
the
hair
-
brush
by
this
time
,
and
the
whole
strength
of
her
feelings
had
passed
into
THAT
.
<EOS>
If
you
are
bald
,
you
will
understand
how
she
sacrificed
me
.
<EOS>
If
you
are
not
,
skip
this
bit
,
and
thank
God
you
have
got
something
in
the
way
of
a
defence
between
your
hair
-
brush
and
your
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
Just
on
the
other
side
of
the
holly
,
"
Penelope
went
on
,
"
Mr.
Godfrey
came
to
a
standstill
.
<EOS>
"
You
prefer
,
"
says
he
,
"
that
I
should
stop
here
as
if
nothing
had
happened
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Miss
Rachel
turned
on
him
like
lightning
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
accepted
my
mother
's
invitation
,
"
she
said
;
"
and
you
are
here
to
meet
her
guests
.
<EOS>
Unless
you
wish
to
make
a
scandal
in
the
house
,
you
will
remain
,
of
course
!
"
<EOS>
She
went
on
a
few
steps
,
and
then
seemed
to
relent
a
little
.
"
<EOS>
Let
us
forget
what
has
passed
,
Godfrey
,
"
she
said
,
"
and
let
us
remain
cousins
still
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
gave
him
her
hand
.
<EOS>
He
kissed
it
,
which
I
should
have
considered
taking
a
liberty
,
and
then
she
left
him
.
<EOS>
He
waited
a
little
by
himself
,
with
his
head
down
,
and
his
heel
grinding
a
hole
slowly
in
the
gravel
walk
;
you
never
saw
a
man
look
more
put
out
in
your
life
.
"
<EOS>
Awkward
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
between
his
teeth
,
when
he
looked
up
,
and
went
on
to
the
house
 
"
very
awkward
!
"
<EOS>
If
that
was
his
opinion
of
himself
,
he
was
quite
right
.
<EOS>
Awkward
enough
,
I
'm
sure
.
<EOS>
And
the
end
of
it
is
,
father
,
what
I
told
you
all
along
,
"
cries
Penelope
,
finishing
me
off
with
a
last
scarification
,
the
hottest
of
all
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Franklin
's
the
man
!
"
  
<EOS>
I
got
possession
of
the
hair
-
brush
,
and
opened
my
lips
to
administer
the
reproof
which
,
you
will
own
,
my
daughter
's
language
and
conduct
richly
deserved
.
  
<EOS>
Before
I
could
say
a
word
,
the
crash
of
carriage
-
wheels
outside
struck
in
,
and
stopped
me
.
<EOS>
The
first
of
the
dinner
-
company
had
come
.
<EOS>
Penelope
instantly
ran
off
.
<EOS>
I
put
on
my
coat
,
and
looked
in
the
glass
.
<EOS>
My
head
was
as
red
as
a
lobster
;
but
,
in
other
respects
,
I
was
as
nicely
dressed
for
the
ceremonies
of
the
evening
<EOS>
as
a
man
need
be
.
<EOS>
I
got
into
the
hall
just
in
time
to
announce
the
two
first
of
the
guests
.
<EOS>
You
need
n't
feel
particularly
interested
about
them
.
<EOS>
Only
the
philanthropist
's
father
and
mother
 
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Ablewhite
.
    
<EOS>
One
on
the
top
of
the
other
the
rest
of
the
company
followed
the
Ablewhites
,
till
we
had
the
whole
tale
of
them
complete
.
<EOS>
Including
the
family
,
they
were
twenty
-
four
in
all
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
noble
sight
to
see
,
when
they
were
settled
in
their
places
<EOS>
round
the
dinner
-
table
,
and
the
Rector
of
Frizinghall
(
with
beautiful
elocution
)
rose
and
said
grace
.
  
<EOS>
There
is
no
need
to
worry
you
with
a
list
of
the
guests
.
<EOS>
You
will
meet
none
of
them
a
second
time
 
in
my
part
of
the
story
,
at
any
rate
 
with
the
exception
of
two
.
  
<EOS>
Those
two
sat
on
either
side
of
Miss
Rachel
,
who
,
as
queen
of
the
day
,
was
naturally
the
great
attraction
of
the
party
.
<EOS>
On
this
occasion
she
was
more
particularly
the
centre
-
point
towards
which
everybody
's
eyes
were
directed
;
for
(
to
my
lady
's
secret
annoyance
)
she
wore
her
wonderful
birthday
present
,
which
eclipsed
all
the
rest
 
the
Moonstone
.
<EOS>
It
was
without
any
setting
when
it
had
been
placed
in
her
hands
;
but
that
universal
genius
,
Mr.
Franklin
,
had
contrived
,
with
the
help
of
his
neat
fingers
and
a
little
bit
of
silver
wire
,
to
fix
it
as
a
brooch
in
the
bosom
of
her
white
dress
.
<EOS>
Everybody
wondered
at
the
prodigious
size
and
beauty
of
the
Diamond
,
as
a
matter
of
course
.
<EOS>
But
the
only
two
of
the
company
who
said
anything
out
of
the
common
way
about
it
were
those
two
guests
I
have
mentioned
,
who
sat
by
Miss
Rachel
on
her
right
hand
and
her
left
.
  
<EOS>
The
guest
on
her
left
was
Mr.
Candy
,
our
doctor
at
Frizinghall
.
  
<EOS>
This
was
a
pleasant
,
companionable
little
man
,
with
the
drawback
,
however
,
I
must
own
,
of
being
too
fond
,
in
season
and
out
of
season
,
of
his
joke
,
and
of
his
plunging
in
rather
a
headlong
manner
into
talk
with
strangers
,
without
waiting
to
feel
his
way
first
.
<EOS>
In
society
he
was
constantly
making
mistakes
,
and
setting
people
unintentionally
by
the
ears
together
.
<EOS>
In
his
medical
practice
he
was
a
more
prudent
man
;
picking
up
his
discretion
(
as
his
enemies
said
)
by
a
kind
of
instinct
,
and
proving
to
be
generally
right
where
more
carefully
conducted
doctors
turned
out
to
be
wrong
.
  
<EOS>
What
HE
said
about
the
Diamond
to
Miss
Rachel
was
said
,
as
usual
,
by
way
of
a
mystification
or
joke
.
<EOS>
He
gravely
entreated
her
(
in
the
interests
of
science
)
to
let
him
take
it
home
and
burn
it
.
<EOS>
"
We
will
first
heat
it
,
Miss
Rachel
,
"
says
the
doctor
,
"
to
such
and
such
a
degree
;
then
we
will
expose
it
to
a
current
of
air
;
and
,
little
by
little
 
puff
!
 
<EOS>
we
evaporate
the
Diamond
,
and
spare
you
a
world
of
anxiety
about
the
safe
keeping
of
a
valuable
precious
stone
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
lady
,
listening
with
rather
a
careworn
expression
on
her
face
,
seemed
to
wish
that
the
doctor
had
been
in
earnest
,
and
that
he
could
have
found
Miss
Rachel
zealous
enough
in
the
cause
of
science
to
sacrifice
her
birthday
gift
.
  
<EOS>
The
other
guest
,
who
sat
on
my
young
lady
's
right
hand
,
was
an
eminent
public
character
 
being
no
other
than
the
celebrated
Indian
traveller
,
Mr.
Murthwaite
,
who
,
at
risk
of
his
life
,
had
penetrated
in
disguise
where
no
European
had
ever
set
foot
before
.
  
<EOS>
This
was
a
long
,
lean
,
wiry
,
brown
,
silent
man
.
<EOS>
He
had
a
weary
look
,
and
a
very
steady
,
attentive
eye
.
<EOS>
It
was
rumoured
that
he
was
tired
of
the
humdrum
life
among
the
people
in
our
parts
,
and
longing
to
go
back
and
wander
off
on
the
tramp
again
in
the
wild
places
of
the
East
.
<EOS>
Except
what
he
said
to
Miss
Rachel
about
her
jewel
,
I
doubt
if
he
spoke
six
words
or
drank
so
much
as
a
single
glass
of
wine
,
all
through
the
dinner
.
<EOS>
The
Moonstone
was
the
only
object
that
interested
him
in
the
smallest
degree
.
<EOS>
The
fame
of
it
seemed
to
have
reached
him
,
in
some
of
those
perilous
Indian
places
where
his
wanderings
had
lain
.
<EOS>
After
looking
at
it
silently
for
so
long
a
time
that
Miss
Rachel
began
to
get
confused
,
he
said
to
her
in
his
cool
immovable
way
,
"
If
you
ever
go
to
India
,
Miss
Verinder
,
do
n't
take
your
uncle
's
birthday
gift
with
you
.
<EOS>
A
Hindoo
diamond
is
sometimes
part
of
a
Hindoo
religion
.
<EOS>
I
know
a
certain
city
,
and
a
certain
temple
in
that
city
,
where
,
dressed
as
you
are
now
,
your
life
would
not
be
worth
five
minutes
'
purchase
.
"
<EOS>
Miss
Rachel
,
safe
in
England
,
was
quite
delighted
to
hear
of
her
danger
in
India
.
<EOS>
The
Bouncers
were
more
delighted
still
;
they
dropped
their
knives
and
forks
with
a
crash
,
and
burst
out
together
vehemently
,
"
O
!
<EOS>
how
interesting
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
lady
fidgeted
in
her
chair
,
and
changed
the
subject
.
  
<EOS>
As
the
dinner
got
on
,
I
became
aware
,
little
by
little
,
that
this
festival
was
not
prospering
as
other
like
festivals
had
prospered
before
it
.
  
<EOS>
Looking
back
at
the
birthday
now
,
by
the
light
of
what
happened
afterwards
,
I
am
half
inclined
to
think
that
the
cursed
Diamond
must
have
cast
a
blight
on
the
whole
company
.
<EOS>
I
plied
them
well
with
wine
;
and
being
a
privileged
character
,
followed
the
unpopular
dishes
round
the
table
,
and
whispered
to
the
company
confidentially
,
"
Please
to
change
your
mind
and
try
it
;
for
I
know
it
will
do
you
good
.
"
<EOS>
Nine
times
out
of
ten
they
changed
their
minds
 
out
of
regard
for
their
old
original
Betteredge
,
they
were
pleased
to
say
 
but
all
to
no
purpose
.
<EOS>
There
were
gaps
of
silence
in
the
talk
,
as
the
dinner
got
on
,
that
made
me
feel
personally
uncomfortable
.
<EOS>
When
they
did
use
their
tongues
again
,
they
used
them
innocently
,
in
the
most
unfortunate
manner
and
to
the
worst
possible
purpose
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Candy
,
the
doctor
,
for
instance
,
said
more
unlucky
things
than
I
ever
knew
him
to
say
before
.
<EOS>
Take
one
sample
of
the
way
in
which
he
went
on
,
and
you
will
understand
what
I
had
to
put
up
with
at
the
sideboard
,
officiating
as
I
was
in
the
character
of
a
man
who
had
the
prosperity
of
the
festival
at
heart
.
  
<EOS>
One
of
our
ladies
present
at
dinner
was
worthy
Mrs.
Threadgall
,
widow
of
the
late
Professor
of
that
name
.
<EOS>
Talking
of
her
deceased
husband
perpetually
,
this
good
lady
never
mentioned
to
strangers
that
he
WAS
deceased
.
<EOS>
She
thought
,
I
suppose
,
that
every
able
-
bodied
adult
in
England
ought
to
know
as
much
as
that
.
<EOS>
In
one
of
the
gaps
of
silence
,
somebody
mentioned
the
dry
and
rather
nasty
subject
of
human
anatomy
;
whereupon
good
Mrs.
Threadgall
straightway
brought
in
her
late
husband
as
usual
,
without
mentioning
that
he
was
dead
.
<EOS>
Anatomy
<EOS>
she
described
as
the
Professor
's
favourite
recreation
in
his
leisure
hours
.
<EOS>
As
ill
-
luck
would
have
it
,
Mr.
Candy
,
sitting
opposite
(
who
knew
nothing
of
the
deceased
gentleman
)
,
heard
her
.
<EOS>
Being
the
most
polite
of
men
,
he
seized
the
opportunity
of
assisting
the
Professor
's
anatomical
amusements
on
the
spot
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
have
got
some
remarkably
fine
skeletons
lately
at
the
College
of
Surgeons
,
"
says
Mr.
Candy
,
across
the
table
,
in
a
loud
cheerful
voice
.
<EOS>
"
I
strongly
recommend
the
Professor
,
ma'am
,
when
he
next
has
an
hour
to
spare
,
to
pay
them
a
visit
.
"
  
<EOS>
You
might
have
heard
a
pin
fall
.
<EOS>
The
company
(
out
of
respect
to
the
Professor
's
memory
)
all
sat
speechless
.
<EOS>
I
was
behind
Mrs.
Threadgall
at
the
time
,
plying
her
confidentially
with
a
glass
of
hock
.
<EOS>
She
dropped
her
head
,
and
said
in
a
very
low
voice
,
"
My
beloved
husband
is
no
more
.
"
  
<EOS>
Unluckily
Mr.
Candy
,
hearing
nothing
,
and
miles
away
from
suspecting
the
truth
,
went
on
across
the
table
louder
and
politer
than
ever
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
Professor
may
not
be
aware
,
"
says
he
,
"
that
the
card
of
a
member
of
the
College
will
admit
him
,
on
any
day
but
Sunday
,
between
the
hours
of
ten
and
four
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Threadgall
dropped
her
head
right
into
her
tucker
,
and
,
in
a
lower
voice
still
,
repeated
the
solemn
words
,
"
My
beloved
husband
is
no
more
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
winked
hard
at
Mr.
Candy
across
the
table
.
<EOS>
Miss
Rachel
touched
his
arm
.
<EOS>
My
lady
looked
unutterable
things
at
him
.
<EOS>
Quite
useless
!
<EOS>
On
he
went
,
with
a
cordiality
that
there
was
no
stopping
anyhow
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
delighted
,
"
says
he
,
"
to
send
the
Professor
my
card
,
if
you
will
oblige
me
by
mentioning
his
present
address
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
His
present
address
,
sir
,
is
THE
GRAVE
,
"
says
Mrs.
Threadgall
,
suddenly
losing
her
temper
,
and
speaking
with
an
emphasis
and
fury
that
made
the
glasses
ring
again
.
<EOS>
"
The
Professor
has
been
dead
these
ten
years
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
good
heavens

says
Mr.
Candy

<EOS>
Excepting
the
Bouncers
,
who
burst
out
laughing
,
such
a
blank
now
fell
on
the
company
,
that
they
might
all
have
been
going
the
way
of
the
Professor
,
and
hailing
as
he
did
from
the
direction
of
the
grave
.
  
<EOS>
So
much
for
Mr.
Candy
.
<EOS>
The
rest
of
them
were
nearly
as
provoking
in
their
different
ways
as
the
doctor
himself
.
<EOS>
When
they
ought
to
have
spoken
,
they
did
n't
speak
;
or
when
they
did
speak
they
were
perpetually
at
cross
purposes
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Godfrey
,
though
so
eloquent
in
public
,
declined
to
exert
himself
in
private
.
<EOS>
Whether
he
was
sulky
,
or
whether
he
was
bashful
,
after
his
discomfiture
in
the
rose
-
garden
,
I
ca
n't
say
.
<EOS>
He
kept
all
his
talk
for
the
private
ear
of
the
lady
(
a
member
of
our
family
)
<EOS>
who
sat
next
to
him
.
<EOS>
She
was
one
of
his
committee
-
women
 
<EOS>
a
spiritually
-
minded
person
,
with
a
fine
show
of
collar
-
bone
and
a
pretty
taste
in
champagne
;
liked
it
dry
,
you
understand
,
and
plenty
of
it
.
<EOS>
Being
close
behind
these
two
at
the
sideboard
,
I
can
testify
,
from
what
I
heard
pass
between
them
,
that
the
company
lost
a
good
deal
of
very
improving
conversation
,
which
I
caught
up
while
drawing
the
corks
,
and
carving
the
mutton
,
and
so
forth
.
<EOS>
What
they
said
about
their
Charities
I
did
n't
hear
.
<EOS>
When
I
had
time
to
listen
to
them
,
they
had
got
a
long
way
beyond
their
women
to
be
confined
,
and
their
women
to
be
rescued
,
and
were
disputing
on
serious
subjects
.
<EOS>
Religion
(
I
understand
Mr.
Godfrey
to
say
,
between
the
corks
and
the
carving
)
meant
love
.
<EOS>
And
love
meant
religion
.
<EOS>
And
earth
was
heaven
a
little
the
worse
for
wear
.
<EOS>
And
heaven
was
earth
,
done
up
again
to
look
like
new
.
<EOS>
Earth
had
some
very
objectionable
people
in
it
;
but
,
to
make
amends
for
that
,
all
the
women
in
heaven
would
be
members
of
a
prodigious
committee
that
never
quarrelled
,
with
all
the
men
in
attendance
on
them
as
ministering
angels
.
<EOS>
Beautiful
!
<EOS>
beautiful
!
<EOS>
But
why
the
mischief
did
Mr.
Godfrey
keep
it
all
to
his
lady
and
himself
?
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Franklin
again
 
surely
,
you
will
say
,
Mr.
Franklin
stirred
the
company
up
into
making
a
pleasant
evening
of
it
?
  
<EOS>
Nothing
of
the
sort
!
<EOS>
He
had
quite
recovered
himself
,
and
he
was
in
wonderful
force
and
spirits
,
<EOS>
Penelope
having
informed
him
,
I
suspect
,
of
Mr.
Godfrey
's
reception
in
the
rose
-
garden
.
<EOS>
But
,
talk
as
he
might
,
nine
times
out
of
ten
he
pitched
on
the
wrong
subject
,
or
he
addressed
himself
to
the
wrong
person
;
the
end
of
it
being
that
he
offended
some
,
and
puzzled
all
of
them
.
<EOS>
That
foreign
training
of
his
 
those
French
and
German
and
Italian
sides
of
him
,
to
which
I
have
already
alluded
 
came
out
,
at
my
lady
's
hospitable
board
,
in
a
most
bewildering
manner
.
  
<EOS>
What
do
you
think
,
for
instance
,
of
his
discussing
the
lengths
to
which
a
married
woman
might
let
her
admiration
go
for
a
man
who
was
not
her
husband
,
and
putting
it
in
his
clear
-
headed
witty
French
way
to
the
maiden
aunt
of
the
Vicar
of
Frizinghall
?
<EOS>
What
do
you
think
,
when
he
shifted
to
the
German
side
,
of
his
telling
the
lord
of
the
manor
,
while
that
great
authority
on
cattle
was
quoting
his
experience
in
the
breeding
of
bulls
,
that
experience
,
properly
understood
counted
for
nothing
,
and
that
the
proper
way
to
breed
bulls
was
to
look
deep
into
your
own
mind
,
evolve
out
of
it
the
idea
of
a
perfect
bull
,
and
produce
him
?
<EOS>
What
do
you
say
,
when
our
county
member
,
growing
hot
,
at
cheese
and
salad
time
,
about
the
spread
of
democracy
in
England
,
burst
out
as
follows
:
"
If
we
once
lose
our
ancient
safeguards
,
Mr.
Blake
,
I
beg
to
ask
you
,
what
have
we
got
left
?
"
 
<EOS>
what
do
you
say
to
Mr.
Franklin
answering
,
from
the
Italian
point
of
view
:
"
We
have
got
three
things
left
,
sir
 
Love
,
Music
,
and
Salad
"
?
<EOS>
He
not
only
terrified
the
company
with
such
outbreaks
as
these
,
but
,
when
the
English
side
of
him
turned
up
in
due
course
,
he
lost
his
foreign
smoothness
;
and
,
getting
on
the
subject
of
the
medical
profession
<EOS>
,
said
such
downright
things
in
ridicule
of
doctors
,
that
he
actually
put
good
-
humoured
little
Mr.
Candy
in
a
rage
.
  
<EOS>
The
dispute
between
them
began
in
Mr.
Franklin
being
led
 
<EOS>
I
forget
how
 
to
acknowledge
that
he
had
latterly
slept
very
badly
at
night
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Candy
thereupon
told
him
that
his
nerves
were
all
out
of
order
and
that
he
ought
to
go
through
a
course
of
medicine
immediately
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Franklin
replied
that
a
course
of
medicine
,
and
a
course
of
groping
in
the
dark
,
meant
,
in
his
estimation
,
one
and
the
same
thing
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Candy
,
hitting
back
smartly
,
said
that
Mr
Franklin
himself
was
,
constitutionally
speaking
,
groping
in
the
dark
after
sleep
,
and
that
nothing
but
medicine
could
help
him
to
find
it
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Franklin
,
keeping
the
ball
up
on
his
side
,
said
he
had
often
heard
of
the
blind
leading
the
blind
,
and
now
,
for
the
first
time
,
he
knew
what
it
meant
.
<EOS>
In
this
way
,
they
kept
it
going
briskly
,
cut
and
thrust
,
till
they
both
of
them
got
hot
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Candy
,
in
particular
,
so
completely
losing
his
self
-
control
,
in
defence
of
his
profession
,
that
my
lady
was
obliged
to
interfere
,
and
forbid
the
dispute
to
go
on
.
<EOS>
This
necessary
act
of
authority
put
the
last
extinguisher
on
the
spirits
of
the
company
.
<EOS>
The
talk
spurted
up
again
here
<EOS>
and
there
,
for
a
minute
or
two
at
a
time
;
but
there
was
a
miserable
lack
of
life
and
sparkle
in
it
.
<EOS>
The
Devil
(
or
the
Diamond
)
possessed
that
dinner
-
party
;
and
it
was
a
relief
to
everybody
when
my
mistress
rose
,
and
gave
the
ladies
the
signal
to
leave
the
gentlemen
over
their
wine
.
  
<EOS>
I
had
just
ranged
the
decanters
in
a
row
before
old
Mr.
Ablewhite
(
who
represented
the
master
of
the
house
)
,
when
there
came
a
sound
from
the
terrace
which
,
startled
me
out
of
my
company
manners
on
the
instant
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Franklin
and
I
looked
at
each
other
;
it
was
the
sound
of
the
Indian
drum
.
<EOS>
As
I
live
by
bread
,
here
were
the
jugglers
returning
to
us
with
the
return
of
the
Moonstone
to
the
house
!
  
<EOS>
As
they
rounded
the
corner
of
the
terrace
,
and
came
in
sight
,
I
hobbled
out
to
warn
them
off
.
<EOS>
But
,
as
ill
-
luck
would
have
it
,
the
two
Bouncers
were
beforehand
with
me
.
<EOS>
They
whizzed
out
on
to
the
terrace
like
a
couple
of
skyrockets
,
wild
to
see
the
Indians
exhibit
their
tricks
.
<EOS>
The
other
ladies
followed
;
the
gentlemen
came
out
on
their
side
.
<EOS>
Before
you
could
say
,
"
Lord
bless
us
!
"
<EOS>
the
rogues
were
making
their
salaams
;
and
the
Bouncers
were
kissing
the
pretty
little
boy
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Franklin
got
on
one
side
of
Miss
Rachel
,
and
I
put
myself
behind
her
.
<EOS>
If
our
suspicions
were
right
,
there
she
stood
,
innocent
of
all
knowledge
of
the
truth
,
showing
the
Indians
the
Diamond
in
the
bosom
of
her
dress
!
  
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
tell
you
what
tricks
they
performed
,
or
how
they
did
it
.
<EOS>
What
with
the
vexation
about
the
dinner
,
and
what
with
the
provocation
of
the
rogues
coming
back
just
in
the
nick
of
time
to
see
the
jewel
with
their
own
eyes
,
I
own
I
lost
my
head
.
<EOS>
The
first
thing
that
I
remember
noticing
was
the
sudden
appearance
on
the
scene
of
the
Indian
traveller
,
Mr.
Murthwaite
.
<EOS>
Skirting
the
half
-
circle
in
which
the
gentlefolks
stood
or
sat
,
he
came
quietly
behind
the
jugglers
and
spoke
to
them
on
a
sudden
in
the
language
of
their
own
country
.
  
<EOS>
If
he
had
pricked
them
with
a
bayonet
,
I
doubt
if
the
Indians
could
have
started
and
turned
on
him
with
a
more
tigerish
quickness
than
they
did
,
on
hearing
the
first
words
that
passed
his
lips
.
<EOS>
The
next
moment
they
were
bowing
and
salaaming
to
him
in
their
most
polite
and
snaky
way
.
<EOS>
After
a
few
words
in
the
unknown
tongue
had
passed
on
either
side
,
Mr.
Murthwaite
withdrew
as
quietly
as
he
had
approached
.
<EOS>
The
chief
Indian
,
who
acted
as
interpreter
,
thereupon
wheeled
about
again
towards
the
gentlefolks
.
<EOS>
I
noticed
that
the
fellow
's
coffee
-
coloured
face
had
turned
grey
since
Mr.
Murthwaite
had
spoken
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
bowed
to
my
lady
,
and
informed
her
that
the
exhibition
was
over
.
<EOS>
The
Bouncers
,
indescribably
disappointed
,
burst
out
with
a
loud
"
O
!
"
<EOS>
directed
against
Mr.
Murthwaite
for
stopping
the
performance
.
<EOS>
The
chief
Indian
laid
his
hand
humbly
on
his
breast
,
and
said
a
second
time
that
the
juggling
was
over
.
<EOS>
The
little
boy
went
round
with
the
hat
.
<EOS>
The
ladies
withdrew
to
the
drawing
-
room
;
and
the
gentlemen
(
excepting
Mr.
Franklin
and
Mr.
Murthwaite
)
returned
to
their
wine
.
<EOS>
I
and
the
footman
followed
the
Indians
,
and
saw
them
safe
off
the
premises
.
  
<EOS>
Going
back
by
way
of
the
shrubbery
,
I
smelt
tobacco
,
and
found
Mr.
Franklin
and
Mr.
Murthwaite
(
the
latter
smoking
a
cheroot
)
walking
slowly
up
and
down
among
the
trees
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Franklin
beckoned
to
me
to
join
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
This
,
"
says
Mr.
Franklin
,
presenting
me
to
the
great
traveller
,
"
is
Gabriel
Betteredge
,
the
old
servant
and
friend
of
our
family
of
whom
I
spoke
to
you
just
now
.
<EOS>
Tell
him
,
if
you
please
,
what
you
have
just
told
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Murthwaite
took
his
cheroot
out
of
his
mouth
,
and
leaned
,
in
his
weary
way
,
against
the
trunk
of
a
tree
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Betteredge
,
"
he
began
,
"
those
three
Indians
are
no
more
jugglers
than
you
<EOS>
and
I
are
.
"
  
<EOS>
Here
was
a
new
surprise
!
<EOS>
I
naturally
asked
the
traveller
if
he
had
ever
met
with
the
Indians
before
.
  
<EOS>
"
Never
,
"
says
Mr.
Murthwaite
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
know
what
Indian
juggling
really
is
.
<EOS>
All
you
have
seen
to
-
night
is
a
very
bad
and
clumsy
imitation
of
it
.
<EOS>
Unless
,
after
long
experience
,
I
am
utterly
mistaken
,
those
men
are
high
-
caste
Brahmins
.
<EOS>
I
charged
them
with
being
disguised
,
and
you
saw
how
it
told
on
them
,
clever
as
the
Hindoo
people
are
in
concealing
their
feelings
.
<EOS>
There
is
a
mystery
about
their
conduct
that
I
ca
n't
explain
.
<EOS>
They
have
doubly
sacrificed
their
caste
 
first
,
in
crossing
the
sea
;
secondly
,
in
disguising
themselves
as
jugglers
.
<EOS>
In
the
land
they
live
in
that
is
a
tremendous
sacrifice
to
make
.
<EOS>
There
must
be
some
very
serious
motive
at
the
bottom
of
it
,
and
some
justification
of
no
ordinary
kind
to
plead
for
them
,
in
recovery
of
their
caste
,
when
they
return
to
their
own
country
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
was
struck
dumb
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Murthwaite
went
on
with
his
cheroot
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Franklin
,
after
what
looked
to
me
like
a
little
private
veering
about
between
the
different
sides
of
his
character
,
broke
the
silence
as
follows
:
  
<EOS>
"
I
feel
some
hesitation
,
Mr.
Murthwaite
,
in
troubling
you
with
family
matters
,
in
which
you
can
have
no
interest
and
which
I
am
not
very
willing
to
speak
of
out
of
our
own
circle
.
<EOS>
But
,
after
what
you
have
said
,
I
feel
bound
,
in
the
interests
of
Lady
Verinder
and
her
daughter
,
to
tell
you
something
which
may
possibly
put
the
clue
into
your
hands
.
<EOS>
I
speak
to
you
in
confidence
;
you
will
oblige
me
<EOS>
,
I
am
sure
,
by
not
forgetting
that
?
"
  
<EOS>
With
this
preface
,
he
told
the
Indian
traveller
all
that
he
had
told
me
at
the
Shivering
Sand
.
<EOS>
Even
the
immovable
Mr.
Murthwaite
was
so
interested
in
what
he
heard
,
that
he
let
his
cheroot
go
out
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
"
says
Mr.
Franklin
,
when
he
had
done
,
"
what
does
your
experience
say
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
My
experience
,
"
answered
the
traveller
,
"
says
that
you
have
had
more
narrow
escapes
of
your
life
,
Mr.
Franklin
Blake
,
than
I
have
had
of
mine
;
and
that
is
saying
a
great
deal
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
Mr.
Franklin
's
turn
to
be
astonished
now
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
it
really
as
serious
as
that
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
In
my
opinion
it
is
,
"
answered
Mr.
Murthwaite
.
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
doubt
,
after
what
you
have
told
me
,
that
the
restoration
of
the
Moonstone
to
its
place
on
the
forehead
of
the
Indian
idol
,
is
the
motive
and
the
justification
of
that
sacrifice
of
caste
which
I
alluded
to
just
now
.
<EOS>
Those
men
will
wait
their
opportunity
with
the
patience
of
cats
,
and
will
use
it
with
the
ferocity
of
tigers
.
<EOS>
How
you
have
escaped
them
I
ca
n't
imagine
,
"
says
the
eminent
traveller
,
lighting
his
cheroot
again
,
and
staring
hard
at
Mr.
Franklin
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
been
carrying
the
Diamond
backwards
and
forwards
,
here
and
in
London
,
and
you
are
still
a
living
man
!
<EOS>
Let
us
try
and
account
for
it

<EOS>
It
was
daylight
,
both
times
,
I
suppose
,
when
you
took
the
jewel
out
of
the
bank
in
London
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Broad
daylight
,
"
says
Mr.
Franklin
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
plenty
of
people
in
the
streets
?
"
  
"
Plenty
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
settled
,
of
course
,
to
arrive
at
Lady
Verinder
's
house
at
a
certain
time
?
<EOS>
It
's
a
lonely
country
between
this
and
the
station
.
<EOS>
Did
you
keep
your
appointment
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
No
.
<EOS>
I
arrived
four
hours
earlier
than
my
appointment
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
beg
to
congratulate
you
on
that
proceeding
!
<EOS>
When
did
you
take
the
Diamond
to
the
bank
at
the
town
here
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
took
it
an
hour
after
I
had
brought
it
to
this
house
 
and
three
hours
before
anybody
was
prepared
for
seeing
me
in
these
parts
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
beg
to
congratulate
you
again
!
<EOS>
Did
you
bring
it
back
here
alone
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
No
.
<EOS>
I
happened
to
ride
back
with
my
cousins
and
the
groom
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
beg
to
congratulate
you
for
the
third
time
!
<EOS>
If
you
ever
feel
inclined
to
travel
beyond
the
civilised
limits
,
Mr.
Blake
,
let
me
know
,
and
I
will
go
with
you
.
<EOS>
You
are
a
lucky
man
.
"
  
<EOS>
Here
I
struck
in
.
<EOS>
This
sort
of
thing
did
n't
at
all
square
with
my
English
ideas
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
really
mean
to
say
,
sir
,
"
I
asked
,
"
that
they
would
have
taken
Mr.
Franklin
's
life
,
to
get
their
Diamond
,
if
he
had
given
them
the
chance
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
smoke
,
Mr.
Betteredge
?
"
says
the
traveller
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
care
much
for
the
ashes
left
in
your
pipe
when
you
empty
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
In
the
country
those
men
came
from
,
they
care
just
as
much
about
killing
a
man
,
as
you
care
about
emptying
the
ashes
out
of
your
pipe
.
<EOS>
If
a
thousand
lives
stood
between
them
and
the
getting
back
of
their
Diamond
 
<EOS>
and
if
they
thought
they
could
destroy
those
lives
without
discovery
 
they
would
take
them
all
.
<EOS>
The
sacrifice
of
caste
is
a
serious
thing
in
India
,
if
you
like
.
<EOS>
The
sacrifice
of
life
is
nothing
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
expressed
my
opinion
upon
this
,
that
they
were
a
set
of
murdering
thieves
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Murthwaite
expressed
HIS
opinion
that
they
were
a
wonderful
people
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Franklin
,
expressing
no
opinion
at
all
,
brought
us
back
to
the
matter
in
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
have
seen
the
Moonstone
on
Miss
Verinder
's
dress
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
What
is
to
be
done
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
your
uncle
threatened
to
do
,
"
answered
Mr.
Murthwaite
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Colonel
Herncastle
understood
the
people
he
had
to
deal
with
.
<EOS>
Send
the
Diamond
to
-
morrow
(
under
guard
of
more
than
one
man
)
to
be
cut
up
at
Amsterdam
.
<EOS>
Make
half
a
dozen
diamonds
of
it
,
instead
of
one
.
<EOS>
There
is
an
end
of
its
sacred
identity
as
The
Moonstone
 
<EOS>
and
there
is
an
end
of
the
conspiracy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Franklin
turned
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
no
help
for
it
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
We
must
speak
to
Lady
Verinder
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
about
to
-
night
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
"
<EOS>
Suppose
the
Indians
come
back
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Murthwaite
answered
me
before
Mr.
Franklin
could
speak
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
Indians
wo
n't
risk
coming
back
to
-
night
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
The
direct
way
is
hardly
ever
the
way
they
take
to
anything
 
let
alone
a
matter
like
this
,
in
which
the
slightest
mistake
might
be
fatal
to
their
reaching
their
end
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
suppose
the
rogues
are
bolder
than
you
think
,
sir
?
"
I
persisted
.
  
<EOS>
"
In
that
case
,
"
says
Mr.
Murthwaite
,
"
let
the
dogs
loose
.
<EOS>
Have
you
got
any
big
dogs
in
the
yard
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Two
,
sir
.
<EOS>
A
mastiff
and
a
bloodhound
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
will
do
.
<EOS>
In
the
present
emergency
,
Mr.
Betteredge
,
the
mastiff
and
the
bloodhound
have
one
great
merit
 
<EOS>
they
are
not
likely
to
be
troubled
with
your
scruples
about
the
sanctity
of
human
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
strumming
of
the
piano
reached
us
from
the
drawing
-
room
,
as
he
fired
that
shot
at
me
.
<EOS>
He
threw
away
his
cheroot
,
and
took
Mr.
Franklin
's
arm
,
to
go
back
to
the
ladies
.
<EOS>
I
noticed
that
the
sky
was
clouding
over
fast
,
as
I
followed
them
to
the
house
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Murthwaite
noticed
it
too
.
<EOS>
He
looked
round
at
me
,
in
his
dry
,
droning
way
,
and
said
:
  
"
The
Indians
will
want
their
umbrellas
,
Mr.
Betteredge
,
to
-
night
!
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
all
very
well
for
HIM
to
joke
.
<EOS>
But
I
was
not
an
eminent
traveller
 
and
my
way
in
this
world
had
not
led
me
into
playing
ducks
and
drakes
with
my
own
life
,
among
thieves
and
murderers
in
the
outlandish
places
of
the
earth
.
<EOS>
I
went
into
my
own
little
room
,
and
sat
down
in
my
chair
in
a
perspiration
,
and
wondered
helplessly
what
was
to
be
done
next
.
<EOS>
In
this
anxious
frame
of
mind
,
other
men
might
have
ended
by
working
themselves
up
into
a
fever
;
I
ended
in
a
different
way
.
<EOS>
I
lit
my
pipe
,
and
took
a
turn
at
ROBINSON
CRUSOE
.
  
<EOS>
Before
I
had
been
at
it
five
minutes
,
I
came
to
this
amazing
bit
 
page
one
hundred
and
sixty
-
one
 
as
follows
:
  
"
<EOS>
Fear
of
Danger
is
ten
thousand
times
more
terrifying
than
Danger
itself
,
when
apparent
to
the
Eyes
;
and
we
find
the
Burthen
of
Anxiety
greater
,
by
much
,
than
the
Evil
which
we
are
anxious
about
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
man
who
does
n't
believe
in
ROBINSON
CRUSOE
,
after
THAT
,
is
a
man
with
a
screw
loose
in
his
understanding
,
or
a
man
lost
in
the
mist
of
his
own
self
-
conceit
!
<EOS>
Argument
is
thrown
away
upon
him
;
and
pity
is
better
reserved
for
some
person
with
a
livelier
faith
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
far
on
with
my
second
pipe
,
and
still
lost
in
admiration
of
that
wonderful
book
,
when
Penelope
(
who
had
been
handing
round
the
tea
)
came
in
with
her
report
from
the
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
She
had
left
the
Bouncers
singing
a
duet
 
words
beginning
with
a
large
"
O
,
"
and
music
to
correspond
.
<EOS>
She
had
observed
that
my
lady
made
mistakes
in
her
game
of
whist
for
the
first
time
in
our
experience
of
her
.
<EOS>
She
had
seen
the
great
traveller
asleep
in
a
corner
.
<EOS>
She
had
overheard
Mr.
Franklin
sharpening
his
wits
on
Mr.
Godfrey
,
at
the
expense
of
Ladies
'
Charities
in
general
;
and
she
had
noticed
that
Mr.
Godfrey
hit
him
back
again
rather
more
smartly
than
became
a
gentleman
of
his
benevolent
character
.
<EOS>
She
had
detected
Miss
Rachel
,
apparently
engaged
in
appeasing
Mrs.
Threadgall
by
showing
her
some
photographs
,
and
really
occupied
in
stealing
looks
at
Mr.
Franklin
,
which
no
intelligent
lady
's
maid
could
misinterpret
for
a
single
instant
.
<EOS>
Finally
,
she
had
missed
Mr.
Candy
,
the
doctor
,
who
had
mysteriously
disappeared
from
the
drawing
-
room
,
and
had
then
mysteriously
returned
,
and
entered
into
conversation
with
Mr.
Godfrey
.
<EOS>
Upon
the
whole
,
things
were
prospering
better
than
the
experience
of
the
dinner
<EOS>
gave
us
any
right
to
expect
.
<EOS>
If
we
could
only
hold
on
for
another
hour
,
old
Father
Time
would
bring
up
their
carriages
,
and
relieve
us
of
them
altogether
.
  
<EOS>
Everything
wears
off
in
this
world
;
and
even
the
comforting
effect
of
ROBINSON
CRUSOE
wore
off
,
after
Penelope
left
me
.
<EOS>
I
got
fidgety
again
,
and
resolved
on
making
a
survey
of
the
grounds
before
the
rain
came
.
<EOS>
Instead
of
taking
the
footman
,
whose
nose
was
human
,
and
therefore
useless
in
any
emergency
,
I
took
the
bloodhound
with
me
.
<EOS>
HIS
nose
for
a
stranger
was
to
be
depended
on
.
<EOS>
We
went
all
round
the
premises
,
and
out
into
the
road
 
and
returned
as
wise
as
we
went
,
having
discovered
no
such
thing
as
a
lurking
human
creature
anywhere
.
  
<EOS>
The
arrival
of
the
carriages
was
the
signal
for
the
arrival
of
the
rain
.
<EOS>
It
poured
as
if
it
meant
to
pour
all
night
.
<EOS>
With
the
exception
of
the
doctor
,
whose
gig
was
waiting
for
him
,
the
rest
of
the
company
went
home
snugly
,
under
cover
,
in
close
carriages
.
<EOS>
I
told
Mr.
Candy
that
I
was
afraid
he
would
get
wet
through
.
<EOS>
He
told
me
,
in
return
,
that
he
wondered
I
had
arrived
at
my
time
of
life
,
without
knowing
that
a
doctor
's
skin
was
waterproof
.
<EOS>
So
he
drove
away
in
the
rain
,
laughing
over
his
own
little
joke
;
and
so
we
got
rid
of
our
dinner
company
.
  
<EOS>
The
next
thing
to
tell
is
the
story
of
the
night
.
    
<EOS>
When
the
last
of
the
guests
had
driven
away
,
I
went
back
into
the
inner
hall
and
found
Samuel
at
the
side
-
table
,
presiding
over
the
brandy
and
soda
-
water
.
<EOS>
My
lady
and
Miss
Rachel
came
out
of
the
drawing
-
room
,
followed
by
the
two
gentlemen
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Godfrey
had
some
brandy
and
soda
-
water
,
Mr.
Franklin
took
nothing
.
<EOS>
He
sat
down
,
looking
dead
tired
;
the
talking
on
this
birthday
occasion
had
,
I
suppose
,
been
too
much
for
him
.
  
<EOS>
My
lady
,
turning
round
to
wish
them
good
-
night
,
looked
hard
at
the
wicked
Colonel
's
legacy
shining
in
her
daughter
's
dress
.
  
<EOS>
"
Rachel
,
"
she
asked
,
"
where
are
you
going
to
put
your
Diamond
to
-
night
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Rachel
was
in
high
good
spirits
,
just
in
that
humour
for
talking
nonsense
,
and
perversely
persisting
in
it
as
if
it
was
sense
,
which
you
may
sometimes
have
observed
in
young
girls
,
when
they
are
highly
wrought
up
,
at
the
end
of
an
exciting
day
.
<EOS>
First
,
she
declared
she
did
n't
know
where
to
put
the
Diamond
.
<EOS>
Then
she
said
,
"
on
her
dressing
-
table
,
of
course
,
along
with
her
other
things
.
"
<EOS>
Then
she
remembered
that
the
Diamond
might
take
to
shining
of
itself
,
with
its
awful
moony
light
in
the
dark
 
and
that
would
terrify
her
in
the
dead
of
night
.
<EOS>
Then
she
bethought
herself
of
an
Indian
cabinet
which
stood
in
her
sitting
-
room
;
and
instantly
made
up
her
mind
to
put
the
Indian
diamond
in
the
Indian
cabinet
,
for
the
purpose
of
permitting
two
beautiful
native
productions
to
admire
each
other
.
<EOS>
Having
let
her
little
flow
of
nonsense
run
on
as
far
as
that
point
,
her
mother
interposed
and
stopped
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
!
<EOS>
your
Indian
cabinet
has
no
lock
to
it
,
"
says
my
lady
.
  
<EOS>
"
Good
Heavens
,
mamma
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Miss
Rachel
,
"
is
this
an
hotel
?
<EOS>
Are
there
thieves
in
the
house
?
"
  
<EOS>
Without
taking
notice
of
this
fantastic
way
of
talking
,
my
lady
wished
the
gentlemen
good
-
night
.
<EOS>
She
next
turned
to
Miss
Rachel
,
and
kissed
her
.
<EOS>
"
Why
not
let
ME
keep
the
Diamond
for
you
to
-
night
?
"
<EOS>
she
asked
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Rachel
received
that
proposal
as
she
might
,
ten
years
since
,
have
received
a
proposal
to
part
her
from
a
new
doll
.
<EOS>
My
lady
saw
there
was
no
reasoning
with
her
that
night
.
<EOS>
"
Come
into
my
room
,
Rachel
,
the
first
thing
to
-
morrow
morning
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
have
something
to
say
to
you
.
"
<EOS>
With
those
last
words
she
left
us
slowly
;
thinking
her
own
thoughts
,
and
,
to
all
appearance
,
not
best
pleased
with
the
way
by
which
they
were
leading
her
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Rachel
was
the
next
to
say
good
-
night
.
<EOS>
She
shook
hands
first
with
Mr.
Godfrey
,
who
was
standing
at
the
other
end
of
the
hall
,
looking
at
a
picture
.
<EOS>
Then
she
turned
back
to
Mr.
Franklin
,
still
sitting
weary
and
silent
in
a
corner
.
  
<EOS>
What
words
passed
between
them
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
say
.
<EOS>
But
standing
near
the
old
oak
frame
which
holds
our
large
looking
-
glass
,
I
saw
her
reflected
in
it
,
slyly
slipping
the
locket
which
Mr.
Franklin
had
given
to
her
,
out
of
the
bosom
of
her
dress
,
and
showing
it
to
him
for
a
moment
,
with
a
smile
which
certainly
meant
something
out
of
the
common
,
before
she
tripped
off
to
bed
.
<EOS>
This
incident
staggered
me
a
little
in
the
reliance
I
had
previously
felt
on
my
own
judgment
.
<EOS>
I
began
to
think
that
Penelope
might
be
right
about
the
state
of
her
young
lady
's
affections
,
after
all
.
  
<EOS>
As
soon
as
Miss
Rachel
left
him
eyes
to
see
with
,
Mr.
Franklin
noticed
me
.
<EOS>
His
variable
humour
,
shifting
about
everything
,
had
shifted
about
the
Indians
already
.
  
<EOS>
"
Betteredge
,
"
he
said
,
"
I
'm
half
inclined
to
think
I
took
Mr.
Murthwaite
too
seriously
,
when
we
had
that
talk
in
the
shrubbery
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
whether
he
has
been
trying
any
of
his
traveller
's
tales
on
us
?
<EOS>
Do
you
really
mean
to
let
the
dogs
loose
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
relieve
them
of
their
collars
,
sir
,
"
I
answered
,
"
and
leave
them
free
to
take
a
turn
in
the
night
,
if
they
smell
a
reason
for
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
All
right
,
"
says
Mr.
Franklin
.
<EOS>
"
We
'll
see
what
is
to
be
done
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
at
all
disposed
to
alarm
my
aunt
,
Betteredge
,
without
a
very
pressing
reason
for
it
.
<EOS>
Good
-
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
looked
so
worn
and
pale
as
he
nodded
to
me
,
and
took
his
candle
to
go
up
-
stairs
,
that
I
ventured
to
advise
his
having
a
drop
of
brandy
-
and
-
water
,
by
way
of
night
-
cap
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Godfrey
,
walking
towards
us
from
the
other
end
of
the
hall
,
backed
me
.
<EOS>
He
pressed
Mr.
Franklin
,
in
the
friendliest
manner
,
to
take
something
,
before
he
went
to
bed
.
  
<EOS>
I
only
note
these
trifling
circumstances
,
because
,
after
all
I
had
seen
and
heard
,
that
day
,
it
pleased
me
to
observe
that
our
two
gentlemen
were
on
just
as
good
terms
as
ever
.
<EOS>
Their
warfare
of
words
(
heard
by
Penelope
in
the
drawing
-
room
)
,
and
their
rivalry
for
the
best
place
in
Miss
Rachel
's
good
graces
,
seemed
to
have
set
no
serious
difference
between
them
.
<EOS>
But
there
!
<EOS>
they
were
both
good
-
tempered
,
and
both
men
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
And
there
is
certainly
this
merit
in
people
of
station
,
that
they
are
not
nearly
so
quarrelsome
among
each
other
as
people
of
no
station
at
all
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Franklin
declined
the
brandy
-
and
-
water
,
and
went
up
-
stairs
with
Mr.
Godfrey
,
their
rooms
being
next
door
to
each
other
.
<EOS>
On
the
landing
,
however
,
either
his
cousin
persuaded
him
,
or
he
veered
about
and
changed
his
mind
as
usual
.
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
I
may
want
it
in
the
night
,
"
he
called
down
to
me
.
"
<EOS>
Send
up
some
brandy
-
and
-
water
into
my
room
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
sent
up
Samuel
with
the
brandy
-
and
-
water
;
and
then
went
out
and
unbuckled
the
dogs
'
collars
.
<EOS>
They
both
lost
their
heads
with
astonishment
on
being
set
loose
at
that
time
of
night
,
and
jumped
upon
me
like
a
couple
of
puppies
!
<EOS>
However
,
the
rain
soon
cooled
them
down
again
:
they
lapped
a
drop
of
water
each
,
and
crept
back
into
their
kennels
.
<EOS>
As
I
went
into
the
house
I
noticed
signs
in
the
sky
which
betokened
a
break
in
the
weather
for
the
better
.
<EOS>
For
the
present
,
it
still
poured
heavily
,
and
the
ground
was
in
a
perfect
sop
.
  
<EOS>
Samuel
and
I
went
all
over
the
house
,
and
shut
up
as
usual
.
<EOS>
I
examined
everything
myself
,
and
trusted
nothing
to
my
deputy
on
this
occasion
.
<EOS>
All
was
safe
and
fast
when
I
rested
my
old
bones
in
bed
,
between
midnight
and
one
in
the
morning
.
  
<EOS>
The
worries
of
the
day
had
been
a
little
too
much
for
me
,
I
suppose
.
<EOS>
At
any
rate
,
I
had
a
touch
of
Mr.
Franklin
's
malady
that
night
.
<EOS>
It
was
sunrise
before
I
fell
off
at
last
into
a
sleep
.
<EOS>
All
the
time
I
lay
awake
the
house
was
as
quiet
as
the
grave
.
<EOS>
Not
a
sound
stirred
but
the
splash
of
the
rain
,
and
the
sighing
of
the
wind
among
the
trees
as
a
breeze
sprang
up
with
the
morning
.
  
<EOS>
About
half
-
past
seven
I
woke
,
and
opened
my
window
on
a
fine
sunshiny
day
.
<EOS>
The
clock
had
struck
eight
,
and
I
was
just
going
out
to
chain
up
the
dogs
again
,
when
I
heard
a
sudden
whisking
of
petticoats
on
the
stairs
behind
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
turned
about
,
and
there
was
Penelope
flying
down
after
me
like
mad
.
"
<EOS>
Father
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
screamed
,
"
come
up
-
stairs
,
for
God
's
sake
!
<EOS>
THE
DIAMOND
IS
GONE
!
"
<EOS>
"
Are
you
out
of
your
mind
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Gone
!
"
says
Penelope
.
<EOS>
"
Gone
,
nobody
knows
how
!
<EOS>
Come
up
and
see
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
dragged
me
after
her
into
our
young
lady
's
sitting
-
room
,
which
opened
into
her
bedroom
.
<EOS>
There
,
on
the
threshold
of
her
bedroom
door
,
stood
Miss
Rachel
,
almost
as
white
in
the
face
as
the
white
dressing
-
gown
that
clothed
her
.
<EOS>
There
also
stood
the
two
doors
of
the
Indian
cabinet
,
wide
open
.
<EOS>
One
,
of
the
drawers
inside
was
pulled
out
as
far
as
it
would
go
.
  
<EOS>
"
Look
!
"
says
Penelope
.
<EOS>
"
I
myself
saw
Miss
Rachel
put
the
Diamond
into
that
drawer
last
night
.
<EOS>
"
I
went
to
the
cabinet
.
<EOS>
The
drawer
was
empty
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
this
true
,
miss
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
  
<EOS>
With
a
look
that
was
not
like
herself
,
with
a
voice
that
was
not
like
her
own
,
Miss
Rachel
answered
as
my
daughter
had
answered
:
"
The
Diamond
is
gone
!
"
<EOS>
Having
said
those
words
,
she
withdrew
into
her
bedroom
,
and
shut
and
locked
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
Before
we
knew
which
way
to
turn
next
,
my
lady
came
in
,
hearing
my
voice
in
her
daughter
's
sitting
-
room
,
and
wondering
what
had
happened
.
<EOS>
The
news
of
the
loss
of
the
Diamond
seemed
to
petrify
her
.
<EOS>
She
went
straight
to
Miss
Rachel
's
bedroom
,
and
insisted
on
being
admitted
.
<EOS>
Miss
Rachel
let
her
in
.
  
<EOS>
The
alarm
,
running
through
the
house
like
fire
,
caught
the
two
gentlemen
next
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Godfrey
was
the
first
to
come
out
of
his
room
.
<EOS>
All
he
did
when
he
heard
what
had
happened
was
to
hold
up
his
hands
in
a
state
of
bewilderment
,
which
did
n't
say
much
for
his
natural
strength
of
mind
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Franklin
,
whose
clear
head
I
had
confidently
counted
on
to
advise
us
,
seemed
to
be
as
helpless
as
his
cousin
when
he
heard
the
news
in
his
turn
.
<EOS>
For
a
wonder
,
he
had
had
a
good
night
's
rest
at
last
;
and
the
unaccustomed
luxury
of
sleep
had
,
as
he
said
himself
,
apparently
stupefied
him
.
<EOS>
However
,
when
he
had
swallowed
his
cup
of
coffee
 
which
he
always
took
,
on
the
foreign
plan
,
some
hours
before
he
ate
any
breakfast
 
his
brains
brightened
;
the
clear
-
headed
side
of
him
turned
up
,
and
he
took
the
matter
in
hand
,
resolutely
and
cleverly
,
much
as
follows
:
  
<EOS>
He
first
sent
for
the
servants
,
and
told
them
to
leave
all
the
lower
doors
and
windows
(
with
the
exception
of
the
front
door
,
which
I
had
opened
)
exactly
as
they
had
been
left
when
we
locked
up
over
night
.
<EOS>
He
next
proposed
to
his
cousin
and
to
me
to
make
quite
sure
,
before
we
took
any
further
steps
,
that
the
Diamond
had
not
accidentally
dropped
somewhere
out
of
sight
 
say
at
the
back
of
the
cabinet
,
or
down
behind
the
table
on
which
the
cabinet
stood
.
<EOS>
Having
searched
in
both
places
,
and
found
nothing
 
having
also
questioned
Penelope
,
and
discovered
from
her
no
more
than
the
little
she
had
already
told
me
 
Mr.
Franklin
suggested
next
extending
our
inquiries
to
Miss
Rachel
,
and
sent
Penelope
to
knock
at
her
bed
-
room
door
.
  
<EOS>
My
lady
answered
the
knock
,
and
closed
the
door
behind
her
.
<EOS>
The
moment
after
we
heard
it
locked
inside
by
Miss
Rachel
.
<EOS>
My
mistress
came
out
among
us
,
looking
sorely
puzzled
and
distressed
.
<EOS>
"
The
loss
of
the
Diamond
seems
to
have
quite
overwhelmed
Rachel
,
"
she
said
,
in
reply
to
Mr.
Franklin
.
<EOS>
"
She
shrinks
,
in
the
strangest
manner
,
from
speaking
of
it
,
even
to
ME
.
<EOS>
It
is
impossible
you
can
see
her
for
the
present
.
"
<EOS>
Having
added
to
our
perplexities
by
this
account
of
Miss
Rachel
,
my
lady
,
after
a
little
effort
,
recovered
her
usual
composure
,
and
acted
with
her
usual
decision
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
there
is
no
help
for
it
?
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
quietly
.
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
I
have
no
alternative
but
to
send
for
the
police
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
the
first
thing
for
the
police
to
do
,
"
added
Mr.
Franklin
,
catching
her
up
,
"
is
to
lay
hands
on
the
Indian
jugglers
who
performed
here
last
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
My
lady
and
Mr.
Godfrey
(
not
knowing
what
Mr.
Franklin
and
I
knew
)
both
started
,
and
both
looked
surprised
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
stop
to
explain
myself
now
,
"
Mr.
Franklin
went
on
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
only
tell
you
that
the
Indians
have
certainly
stolen
the
Diamond
.
<EOS>
Give
me
a
letter
of
introduction
,
"
says
he
,
addressing
my
lady
,
"
to
one
of
the
magistrates
at
Frizinghall
 
merely
telling
him
that
I
represent
your
interests
and
wishes
,
and
let
me
ride
off
with
it
instantly
.
<EOS>
Our
chance
of
catching
the
thieves
may
depend
on
our
not
wasting
one
unnecessary
minute
.
"
<EOS>
(
Nota
bene
:
<EOS>
Whether
it
was
the
French
side
or
the
English
,
the
right
side
of
Mr.
Franklin
seemed
to
be
uppermost
now
.
<EOS>
The
only
question
was
,
How
long
would
it
last
?
)
  
<EOS>
He
put
pen
,
ink
,
and
paper
before
his
aunt
,
who
(
as
it
appeared
to
me
)
wrote
the
letter
he
wanted
a
little
unwillingly
.
<EOS>
If
it
had
been
possible
to
overlook
such
an
event
as
the
loss
of
a
jewel
worth
twenty
thousand
pounds
,
I
believe
 
with
my
lady
's
opinion
of
her
late
brother
,
and
her
distrust
of
his
birthday
-
gift
 
<EOS>
it
would
have
been
privately
a
relief
to
her
to
let
the
thieves
get
off
with
the
Moonstone
scot
free
.
  
<EOS>
I
went
out
with
Mr.
Franklin
to
the
stables
,
and
took
the
opportunity
of
asking
him
how
the
Indians
(
whom
I
suspected
,
of
course
,
as
shrewdly
as
he
did
)
could
possibly
have
got
into
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
"
One
of
them
might
have
slipped
into
the
hall
,
in
the
confusion
,
when
the
dinner
company
were
going
away
,
"
says
Mr.
Franklin
.
<EOS>
"
The
fellow
may
have
been
under
the
sofa
while
my
aunt
and
Rachel
were
talking
about
where
the
Diamond
was
to
be
put
for
the
night
.
<EOS>
He
would
only
have
to
wait
till
the
house
was
quiet
,
and
there
it
would
be
in
the
cabinet
,
to
be
had
for
the
taking
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
With
those
words
,
he
called
to
the
groom
to
open
the
gate
,
and
galloped
off
.
  
<EOS>
This
seemed
certainly
to
be
the
only
rational
explanation
.
<EOS>
But
how
had
the
thief
contrived
to
make
his
escape
from
the
house
?
<EOS>
I
had
found
the
front
door
locked
and
bolted
,
as
I
had
left
it
at
night
,
when
I
went
to
open
it
,
after
getting
up
.
<EOS>
As
for
the
other
doors
and
windows
,
there
they
were
still
,
all
safe
and
fast
,
to
speak
for
themselves
.
<EOS>
The
dogs
,
too
?
<EOS>
Suppose
the
thief
had
got
away
by
dropping
from
one
of
the
upper
windows
,
how
had
he
escaped
the
dogs
?
<EOS>
Had
he
come
provided
for
them
with
drugged
meat
?
<EOS>
As
the
doubt
crossed
my
mind
,
the
dogs
themselves
came
galloping
at
me
round
a
corner
,
rolling
each
other
over
on
the
wet
grass
,
in
such
lively
health
and
spirits
that
it
was
with
no
small
difficulty
I
brought
them
to
reason
,
and
chained
them
up
again
.
<EOS>
The
more
I
turned
it
over
in
my
mind
,
the
less
satisfactory
Mr.
Franklin
's
explanation
appeared
to
be
.
  
<EOS>
We
had
our
breakfasts
 
whatever
happens
in
a
house
,
robbery
or
murder
,
it
does
n't
matter
,
you
must
have
your
breakfast
.
<EOS>
When
we
had
done
,
my
lady
sent
for
me
;
and
I
found
myself
compelled
to
tell
her
all
that
I
had
hitherto
concealed
,
relating
to
the
Indians
and
their
plot
.
<EOS>
Being
a
woman
of
a
high
courage
,
she
soon
got
over
the
first
startling
effect
of
what
I
had
to
communicate
.
<EOS>
Her
mind
seemed
to
be
far
more
perturbed
about
her
daughter
than
about
the
heathen
rogues
and
their
conspiracy
.
<EOS>
"
You
know
how
odd
Rachel
is
,
and
how
differently
she
behaves
sometimes
from
other
girls
,
"
my
lady
said
to
me
.
"
<EOS>
But
I
have
never
,
in
all
my
experience
,
seen
her
so
strange
and
so
reserved
as
she
is
now
.
<EOS>
The
loss
of
her
jewel
seems
almost
to
have
turned
her
brain
.
<EOS>
Who
would
have
thought
that
horrible
Diamond
could
have
laid
such
a
hold
on
her
in
so
short
a
time
?
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
certainly
strange
.
<EOS>
Taking
toys
and
trinkets
in
general
,
Miss
Rachel
was
nothing
like
so
mad
after
them
as
most
young
girls
.
<EOS>
Yet
there
she
was
,
still
locked
up
inconsolably
in
her
bedroom
.
<EOS>
It
is
but
fair
to
add
that
she
was
not
the
only
one
of
us
in
the
house
who
was
thrown
out
of
the
regular
groove
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Godfrey
,
for
instance
 
though
professionally
a
sort
of
consoler
-
general
 
seemed
to
be
at
a
loss
where
to
look
for
his
own
resources
.
<EOS>
Having
no
company
to
amuse
him
,
and
getting
no
chance
of
trying
what
his
experience
of
women
in
distress
could
do
towards
comforting
Miss
Rachel
,
he
wandered
hither
and
thither
about
the
house
and
gardens
in
an
aimless
uneasy
way
.
<EOS>
He
was
in
two
different
minds
about
what
it
became
him
to
do
,
after
the
misfortune
that
had
happened
to
us
.
<EOS>
Ought
he
to
relieve
the
family
,
in
their
present
situation
,
of
the
responsibility
of
him
as
a
guest
,
or
ought
he
to
stay
on
the
chance
that
even
his
humble
services
might
be
of
some
use
?
<EOS>
He
decided
ultimately
that
the
last
course
was
perhaps
the
most
customary
and
considerate
course
to
take
,
in
such
a
very
peculiar
case
of
family
distress
as
this
was
.
<EOS>
Circumstances
try
the
metal
a
man
is
really
made
of
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Godfrey
,
tried
by
circumstances
,
showed
himself
of
weaker
metal
than
I
had
thought
him
to
be
.
<EOS>
As
for
the
women
-
servants
excepting
Rosanna
Spearman
,
who
kept
by
herself
 
they
took
to
whispering
together
in
corners
,
and
staring
at
nothing
suspiciously
,
as
is
the
manner
of
that
weaker
half
of
the
human
family
,
when
anything
extraordinary
happens
in
a
house
.
<EOS>
I
myself
acknowledge
to
have
been
fidgety
and
ill
-
tempered
.
<EOS>
The
cursed
Moonstone
had
turned
us
all
upside
down
.
  
<EOS>
A
little
before
eleven
Mr.
Franklin
came
back
.
<EOS>
The
resolute
side
of
him
had
,
to
all
appearance
,
given
way
,
in
the
interval
since
his
departure
,
under
the
stress
that
had
been
laid
on
it
.
<EOS>
He
had
left
us
at
a
gallop
;
he
came
back
to
us
at
a
walk
.
<EOS>
When
he
went
away
,
he
was
made
of
iron
.
<EOS>
When
he
returned
,
he
was
stuffed
with
cotton
,
as
limp
as
limp
could
be
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
says
my
lady
,
"
are
the
police
coming
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
says
Mr.
Franklin
;
"
they
said
they
would
follow
me
in
a
fly
.
<EOS>
Superintendent
Seegrave
,
of
your
local
police
force
,
and
two
of
his
men
.
<EOS>
A
mere
form
!
<EOS>
The
case
is
hopeless
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
!
<EOS>
have
the
Indians
escaped
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
poor
ill
-
used
Indians
have
been
most
unjustly
put
in
prison
,
"
says
Mr.
Franklin
.
<EOS>
"
They
are
as
innocent
as
the
babe
unborn
.
<EOS>
My
idea
that
one
of
them
was
hidden
in
the
house
has
ended
,
like
all
the
rest
of
my
ideas
,
in
smoke
.
<EOS>
It
's
been
proved
,
"
says
Mr.
Franklin
,
dwelling
with
great
relish
on
his
own
incapacity
,
"
to
be
simply
impossible
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
After
astonishing
us
by
announcing
this
totally
new
turn
in
the
matter
of
the
Moonstone
,
our
young
gentleman
,
at
his
aunt
's
request
,
took
a
seat
,
and
explained
himself
.
  
<EOS>
It
appeared
that
the
resolute
side
of
him
had
held
out
as
far
as
Frizinghall
.
<EOS>
He
had
put
the
whole
case
plainly
before
the
magistrate
,
and
the
magistrate
had
at
once
sent
for
the
police
.
<EOS>
The
first
inquiries
instituted
about
the
Indians
<EOS>
showed
that
they
had
not
so
much
as
attempted
to
leave
the
town
.
<EOS>
Further
questions
addressed
to
the
police
,
proved
that
all
three
had
been
seen
returning
to
Frizinghall
with
their
boy
,
on
the
previous
night
between
ten
and
eleven
 
<EOS>
which
(
regard
being
had
to
hours
and
distances
)
also
proved
that
they
had
walked
straight
back
after
performing
on
our
terrace
.
<EOS>
Later
still
,
at
midnight
,
the
police
,
having
occasion
to
search
the
common
lodging
-
house
where
they
lived
,
had
seen
them
all
three
again
,
and
their
little
boy
with
them
,
as
usual
.
<EOS>
Soon
after
midnight
I
myself
had
safely
shut
up
the
house
.
<EOS>
Plainer
evidence
than
this
,
in
favour
of
the
Indians
,
there
could
not
well
be
.
<EOS>
The
magistrate
said
there
was
not
even
a
case
of
suspicion
against
them
so
far
.
<EOS>
But
,
as
it
was
just
possible
,
when
the
police
came
to
investigate
the
matter
,
that
discoveries
affecting
the
jugglers
might
be
made
,
he
would
contrive
,
by
committing
them
as
rogues
and
vagabonds
,
to
keep
them
at
our
disposal
,
under
lock
and
key
,
for
a
week
.
<EOS>
They
had
ignorantly
done
something
(
I
forget
what
)
in
the
town
,
which
barely
brought
them
within
the
operation
of
the
law
.
<EOS>
Every
human
institution
(
justice
included
)
will
stretch
a
little
,
if
you
only
pull
it
the
right
way
.
<EOS>
The
worthy
magistrate
was
an
old
friend
of
my
lady
's
,
and
the
Indians
were
"
committed
"
for
a
week
,
as
soon
as
the
court
opened
that
morning
.
  
<EOS>
Such
was
Mr.
Franklin
's
narrative
of
events
at
Frizinghall
.
<EOS>
The
Indian
clue
to
the
mystery
of
the
lost
jewel
was
now
,
to
all
appearance
,
a
clue
that
had
broken
in
our
hands
.
<EOS>
If
the
jugglers
were
innocent
,
who
,
in
the
name
of
wonder
,
had
taken
the
Moonstone
out
of
Miss
Rachel
's
drawer
?
  
<EOS>
Ten
minutes
later
,
to
our
infinite
relief
;
Superintendent
Seegrave
arrived
at
the
house
.
<EOS>
He
reported
passing
Mr.
Franklin
on
the
terrace
,
sitting
in
the
sun
(
I
suppose
with
the
Italian
side
of
him
uppermost
)
,
and
warning
the
police
,
as
they
went
by
,
that
the
investigation
was
hopeless
,
before
the
investigation
had
begun
.
  
<EOS>
For
a
family
in
our
situation
,
the
Superintendent
of
the
Frizinghall
police
was
the
most
comforting
officer
you
could
wish
to
see
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Seegrave
was
tall
and
portly
,
and
military
in
his
manners
.
<EOS>
He
had
a
fine
commanding
voice
,
and
a
mighty
resolute
eye
,
and
a
grand
frock
-
coat
which
buttoned
beautifully
up
to
his
leather
stock
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
the
man
you
want
!
"
was
written
all
over
his
face
;
and
he
ordered
his
two
inferior
police
men
about
with
a
severity
which
convinced
us
all
that
there
was
no
trifling
with
HIM
.
  
<EOS>
He
began
by
going
round
the
premises
,
outside
and
in
;
the
result
of
that
investigation
proving
to
him
that
no
thieves
had
broken
in
upon
us
from
outside
,
and
that
the
robbery
,
consequently
,
must
have
been
committed
by
some
person
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
I
leave
you
to
imagine
the
state
the
servants
were
in
when
this
official
announcement
first
reached
their
ears
.
<EOS>
The
Superintendent
decided
to
begin
by
examining
the
boudoir
,
and
,
that
done
,
to
examine
the
servants
next
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
,
he
posted
one
of
his
men
on
the
staircase
which
led
to
the
servants
'
bedrooms
,
with
instructions
to
let
nobody
in
the
house
pass
him
,
till
further
orders
.
  
<EOS>
At
this
latter
proceeding
,
the
weaker
half
of
the
human
family
went
distracted
on
the
spot
.
<EOS>
They
bounced
out
of
their
comers
,
whisked
up
-
stairs
in
a
body
to
Miss
Rachel
's
room
<EOS>
(
Rosanna
Spearman
being
carried
away
among
them
this
time
)
,
burst
in
on
Superintendent
Seegrave
,
and
,
all
looking
equally
guilty
,
summoned
him
to
say
which
of
them
he
suspected
,
at
once
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Superintendent
proved
equal
to
the
occasion
;
he
looked
at
them
with
his
resolute
eye
,
and
he
cowed
them
with
his
military
voice
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
then
,
you
women
,
go
down
-
stairs
again
,
every
one
of
you
;
I
wo
n't
have
you
here
.
<EOS>
Look
!
"
says
Mr.
Superintendent
,
suddenly
pointing
to
a
little
smear
of
the
decorative
painting
on
Miss
Rachel
's
door
,
at
the
outer
edge
,
just
under
the
lock
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Look
what
mischief
the
petticoats
of
some
of
you
have
done
already
.
<EOS>
Clear
out
!
<EOS>
clear
out
!
"
<EOS>
Rosanna
Spearman
,
who
was
nearest
to
him
,
and
nearest
to
the
little
smear
on
the
door
,
set
the
example
of
obedience
,
and
slipped
off
instantly
to
her
work
.
<EOS>
The
rest
followed
her
out
.
<EOS>
The
Superintendent
finished
his
examination
of
the
room
,
and
,
making
nothing
of
it
,
asked
me
who
had
first
discovered
the
robbery
.
<EOS>
My
daughter
had
first
discovered
it
.
<EOS>
My
daughter
was
sent
for
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Superintendent
proved
to
be
a
little
too
sharp
with
Penelope
at
starting
.
"
<EOS>
Now
,
young
woman
,
attend
to
me
,
and
mind
you
speak
the
truth
.
<EOS>
"
Penelope
fired
up
instantly
.
<EOS>
"
I
've
never
been
taught
to
tell
lies
Mr.
Policeman
!
 
<EOS>
and
if
father
can
stand
there
and
hear
me
accused
of
falsehood
and
thieving
,
and
my
own
bed
-
room
shut
against
me
,
and
my
character
taken
away
,
which
is
all
a
poor
girl
has
left
,
he
's
not
the
good
father
<EOS>
I
take
him
for
!
<EOS>
"
A
timely
word
from
me
put
Justice
and
Penelope
on
a
pleasanter
footing
together
.
<EOS>
The
questions
and
answers
went
swimmingly
,
and
ended
in
nothing
worth
mentioning
.
<EOS>
My
daughter
had
seen
Miss
Rachel
put
the
Diamond
in
the
drawer
of
the
cabinet
the
last
thing
at
night
.
<EOS>
She
had
gone
in
with
Miss
Rachel
's
cup
of
tea
at
eight
the
next
morning
,
and
had
found
the
drawer
open
and
empty
.
<EOS>
Upon
that
,
she
had
alarmed
the
house
 
<EOS>
and
there
was
an
end
of
Penelope
's
evidence
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Superintendent
next
asked
to
see
Miss
Rachel
herself
.
<EOS>
Penelope
mentioned
his
request
through
the
door
.
<EOS>
The
answer
reached
us
by
the
same
road
:
"
I
have
nothing
to
tell
the
policeman
 
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
see
anybody
.
<EOS>
"
Our
experienced
officer
looked
equally
surprised
and
offended
when
he
heard
that
reply
.
<EOS>
I
told
him
my
young
lady
was
ill
,
and
begged
him
to
wait
a
little
and
see
her
later
.
<EOS>
We
thereupon
went
downstairs
again
,
and
were
met
by
Mr.
Godfrey
and
Mr.
Franklin
crossing
the
hall
.
  
<EOS>
The
two
gentlemen
,
being
inmates
of
the
house
,
were
summoned
to
say
if
they
could
throw
any
light
on
the
matter
.
<EOS>
Neither
of
them
knew
anything
about
it
.
<EOS>
Had
they
heard
any
suspicious
noises
during
the
previous
night
?
<EOS>
They
had
heard
nothing
but
the
pattering
of
the
rain
.
<EOS>
Had
I
,
lying
awake
longer
than
either
of
them
,
heard
nothing
either
?
<EOS>
Nothing
!
<EOS>
Released
from
examination
,
Mr.
Franklin
,
still
sticking
to
the
helpless
view
of
our
difficulty
,
whispered
to
me
:
"
That
man
will
be
of
no
earthly
use
to
us
.
<EOS>
Superintendent
Seegrave
is
an
ass
.
"
<EOS>
Released
in
his
turn
,
Mr.
Godfrey
whispered
to
me
 
"
Evidently
a
most
competent
person
.
<EOS>
Betteredge
,
I
have
the
greatest
faith
in
him
!
"
<EOS>
Many
men
,
many
opinions
,
as
one
of
the
ancients
said
,
before
my
time
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Superintendent
's
next
proceeding
took
him
back
to
the
"
boudoir
"
again
,
with
my
daughter
and
me
at
his
heels
.
<EOS>
His
object
was
to
discover
whether
any
of
the
furniture
had
been
moved
,
during
the
night
,
out
of
its
customary
place
 
his
previous
investigation
in
the
room
having
,
apparently
,
not
gone
quite
far
enough
to
satisfy
his
mind
on
this
point
.
  
<EOS>
While
we
were
still
poking
about
among
the
chairs
and
tables
,
the
door
of
the
bed
-
room
was
suddenly
opened
.
<EOS>
After
having
denied
herself
to
everybody
,
Miss
Rachel
,
to
our
astonishment
,
walked
into
the
midst
of
us
of
her
own
accord
.
<EOS>
She
took
up
her
garden
hat
from
a
chair
,
and
then
went
straight
to
Penelope
with
this
question
:
    
"
Mr.
Franklin
Blake
sent
you
with
a
message
to
me
this
morning
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
miss
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
wished
to
speak
to
me
,
did
n't
he
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
miss
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Where
is
he
now
?
"
  
<EOS>
Hearing
voices
on
the
terrace
below
,
I
looked
out
of
window
,
and
saw
the
two
gentlemen
walking
up
and
down
together
.
<EOS>
Answering
for
my
daughter
,
I
said
,
"
Mr.
Franklin
is
on
the
terrace
,
miss
.
"
  
<EOS>
Without
another
word
,
without
heeding
Mr.
Superintendent
,
who
tried
to
speak
to
her
,
pale
as
death
,
and
wrapped
up
strangely
in
her
own
thoughts
,
she
left
the
room
,
and
went
down
to
her
cousins
on
the
terrace
.
  
<EOS>
It
showed
a
want
of
due
respect
,
it
showed
a
breach
of
good
manners
,
on
my
part
,
but
,
for
the
life
of
me
,
I
could
n't
help
looking
out
of
window
when
Miss
Rachel
met
the
gentlemen
outside
.
<EOS>
She
went
up
to
Mr.
Franklin
without
appearing
to
notice
Mr.
Godfrey
,
who
thereupon
drew
back
and
left
them
by
themselves
.
<EOS>
What
she
said
to
Mr.
Franklin
appeared
to
be
spoken
vehemently
.
<EOS>
It
lasted
but
for
a
short
time
,
and
,
judging
by
what
I
saw
of
his
face
from
the
window
,
seemed
to
astonish
him
beyond
all
power
of
expression
.
<EOS>
While
they
were
still
together
,
my
lady
appeared
on
the
terrace
.
<EOS>
Miss
Rachel
saw
her
 
said
a
few
last
words
to
Mr.
Franklin
 
and
suddenly
went
back
into
the
house
again
,
before
her
mother
came
up
with
her
.
<EOS>
My
lady
surprised
herself
,
and
noticing
Mr.
Franklin
's
surprise
,
spoke
to
him
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Godfrey
joined
them
,
and
spoke
also
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Franklin
walked
away
a
little
between
the
two
,
telling
them
what
had
happened
<EOS>
I
suppose
,
for
they
both
stopped
short
,
after
taking
a
few
steps
,
like
persons
struck
with
amazement
.
<EOS>
I
had
just
seen
as
much
as
this
,
when
the
door
of
the
sitting
-
room
was
opened
violently
.
<EOS>
Miss
Rachel
walked
swiftly
through
to
her
bed
-
room
,
wild
and
angry
,
with
fierce
eyes
and
flaming
cheeks
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Superintendent
once
more
attempted
to
question
her
.
<EOS>
She
turned
round
on
him
at
her
bed
-
room
door
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
sent
for
you
!
"
<EOS>
she
cried
out
vehemently
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
want
you
.
<EOS>
My
Diamond
is
lost
.
<EOS>
Neither
you
nor
anybody
else
will
ever
find
it
!
"
<EOS>
With
those
words
she
went
in
,
and
locked
the
door
in
our
faces
.
<EOS>
Penelope
,
standing
nearest
to
it
,
heard
her
burst
out
crying
the
moment
she
was
alone
again
.
  
<EOS>
In
a
rage
,
one
moment
;
in
tears
,
the
next
!
<EOS>
What
did
it
mean
?
  
<EOS>
I
told
the
Superintendent
it
meant
that
Miss
Rachel
's
temper
was
upset
by
the
loss
of
her
jewel
.
<EOS>
Being
anxious
for
the
honour
of
the
family
,
it
distressed
me
to
see
my
young
lady
forget
herself
 
even
with
a
police
-
officer
 
<EOS>
and
I
made
the
best
excuse
I
could
,
accordingly
.
<EOS>
In
my
own
private
mind
I
was
more
puzzled
by
Miss
Rachel
's
extraordinary
language
and
conduct
than
words
can
tell
.
<EOS>
Taking
what
she
had
said
at
her
bed
-
room
door
as
a
guide
to
guess
by
,
I
could
only
conclude
that
she
was
mortally
offended
by
our
sending
for
the
police
,
and
that
Mr.
Franklin
's
astonishment
on
the
terrace
was
caused
by
her
having
expressed
herself
to
him
(
as
the
person
chiefly
instrumental
in
fetching
the
police
)
to
that
effect
.
<EOS>
If
this
guess
was
right
,
why
 
having
lost
her
Diamond
 
should
she
object
to
the
presence
in
the
house
of
the
very
people
whose
business
it
was
to
recover
it
for
her
?
<EOS>
And
how
,
in
Heaven
's
name
,
could
SHE
know
that
the
Moonstone
would
never
be
found
again
?
  
<EOS>
As
things
stood
,
at
present
,
no
answer
to
those
questions
was
to
be
hoped
for
from
anybody
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Franklin
appeared
to
think
it
a
point
of
honour
to
forbear
repeating
to
a
servant
 
even
to
so
old
a
servant
as
I
was
 
what
Miss
Rachel
had
said
to
him
on
the
terrace
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Godfrey
,
who
,
as
a
gentleman
and
a
relative
,
had
been
probably
admitted
into
Mr.
Franklin
's
confidence
,
respected
that
confidence
as
he
was
bound
to
do
.
<EOS>
My
lady
,
who
was
also
in
the
secret
no
doubt
,
and
who
alone
had
access
to
Miss
Rachel
,
owned
openly
that
she
could
make
nothing
of
her
.
"
<EOS>
You
madden
me
when
you
talk
of
the
Diamond
!
<EOS>
"
All
her
mother
's
influence
failed
to
extract
from
her
a
word
more
than
that
.
  
<EOS>
Here
we
were
,
then
,
at
a
dead
-
lock
about
Miss
Rachel
 
and
at
a
dead
-
lock
about
the
Moonstone
.
<EOS>
In
the
first
case
,
my
lady
was
powerless
to
help
us
.
<EOS>
In
the
second
(
as
you
shall
presently
judge
)
,
Mr.
Seegrave
was
fast
approaching
the
condition
of
a
superintendent
at
his
wits
'
end
.
  
<EOS>
Having
ferreted
about
all
over
the
"
boudoir
,
"
without
making
any
discoveries
among
the
furniture
,
our
experienced
officer
applied
to
me
to
know
,
whether
the
servants
in
general
were
or
were
not
acquainted
with
the
place
in
which
the
Diamond
had
been
put
for
the
night
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
knew
where
it
was
put
,
sir
,
"
I
said
,
"
to
begin
with
.
<EOS>
Samuel
,
the
footman
,
knew
also
 
for
he
was
present
in
the
hall
,
when
they
were
talking
about
where
the
Diamond
was
to
be
kept
that
night
.
<EOS>
My
daughter
knew
,
as
she
has
already
told
you
.
<EOS>
She
or
Samuel
may
have
mentioned
the
thing
to
the
other
servants
 
or
the
other
servants
may
have
heard
the
talk
for
themselves
,
through
the
side
-
door
of
the
hall
,
which
might
have
been
open
to
the
back
staircase
.
<EOS>
For
all
I
can
tell
,
everybody
in
the
house
may
have
known
where
the
jewel
was
,
last
night
.
"
  
<EOS>
My
answer
presenting
rather
a
wide
field
for
Mr.
Superintendent
's
suspicions
to
range
over
,
he
tried
to
narrow
it
by
asking
about
the
servants
'
characters
next
.
  
<EOS>
I
thought
directly
of
Rosanna
Spearman
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
neither
my
place
nor
my
wish
to
direct
suspicion
against
a
poor
girl
,
whose
honesty
had
been
above
all
doubt
as
long
as
I
had
known
her
.
<EOS>
The
matron
at
the
Reformatory
had
reported
her
to
my
lady
as
a
sincerely
penitent
and
thoroughly
trustworthy
girl
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
Superintendent
's
business
to
discover
reason
for
suspecting
her
first
 
<EOS>
and
then
,
and
not
till
then
,
it
would
be
my
duty
to
tell
him
how
she
came
into
my
lady
's
service
.
<EOS>
"
All
our
people
have
excellent
characters
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
And
all
have
deserved
the
trust
their
mistress
has
placed
in
them
.
"
<EOS>
After
that
,
there
was
but
one
thing
left
for
Mr.
Seegrave
to
do
 
namely
,
to
set
to
work
,
and
tackle
the
servants
'
characters
himself
.
  
<EOS>
One
after
another
,
they
were
examined
.
<EOS>
One
after
another
,
they
proved
to
have
nothing
to
say
 
and
said
it
(
so
far
as
the
women
were
concerned
)
at
great
length
,
and
with
a
very
angry
sense
of
the
embargo
laid
on
their
bed
-
rooms
.
<EOS>
The
rest
of
them
being
sent
back
to
their
places
downstairs
,
Penelope
was
then
summoned
,
and
examined
separately
a
second
time
.
  
<EOS>
My
daughter
's
little
outbreak
of
temper
in
the
"
boudoir
,
"
and
her
readiness
to
think
herself
suspected
,
appeared
to
have
produced
an
unfavourable
impression
on
Superintendent
Seegrave
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
also
to
dwell
a
little
on
his
mind
,
that
she
had
been
the
last
person
who
saw
the
Diamond
at
night
.
<EOS>
When
the
second
questioning
was
over
,
my
girl
came
back
to
me
in
a
frenzy
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
doubt
of
it
any
longer
 
<EOS>
the
police
-
officer
had
almost
as
good
as
told
her
she
was
the
thief
!
<EOS>
I
could
scarcely
believe
him
(
taking
Mr.
Franklin
's
view
)
to
be
quite
such
an
ass
as
that
.
<EOS>
But
,
though
he
said
nothing
,
the
eye
with
which
he
looked
at
my
daughter
was
not
a
very
pleasant
eye
to
see
.
<EOS>
I
laughed
it
off
with
poor
Penelope
,
as
something
too
ridiculous
to
be
treated
seriously
 
which
it
certainly
was
.
<EOS>
Secretly
,
I
am
afraid
I
was
foolish
enough
to
be
angry
too
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
little
trying
 
<EOS>
it
was
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
My
girl
sat
down
in
a
corner
,
with
her
apron
over
her
head
,
quite
broken
-
hearted
.
<EOS>
Foolish
of
her
,
you
will
say
.
<EOS>
She
might
have
waited
till
he
openly
accused
her
.
<EOS>
Well
,
being
a
man
of
just
an
equal
temper
,
I
admit
that
.
<EOS>
Still
Mr.
Superintendent
might
have
remembered
 
never
mind
what
he
might
have
remembered
.
<EOS>
The
devil
take
him
!
  
<EOS>
The
next
and
last
step
in
the
investigation
brought
matters
,
as
they
say
,
to
a
crisis
.
<EOS>
The
officer
had
an
interview
(
at
which
I
was
present
)
with
my
lady
.
<EOS>
After
informing
her
that
the
Diamond
must
have
been
taken
by
somebody
in
the
house
,
he
requested
permission
for
himself
and
his
men
to
search
the
servants
'
rooms
and
boxes
on
the
spot
.
<EOS>
My
good
mistress
,
like
the
generous
high
-
bred
woman
she
was
,
refused
to
let
us
be
treated
like
thieves
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
never
consent
to
make
such
a
return
as
that
,
"
she
said
,
"
for
all
I
owe
to
the
faithful
servants
who
are
employed
in
my
house
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Superintendent
made
his
bow
,
with
a
look
in
my
direction
,
which
said
plainly
,
"
Why
employ
me
,
if
you
are
to
tie
my
hands
in
this
way
?
"
<EOS>
As
head
of
the
servants
,
I
felt
directly
that
we
were
bound
,
in
justice
to
all
parties
,
not
to
profit
by
our
mistress
's
generosity
.
<EOS>
"
We
gratefully
thank
your
ladyship
,
"
I
said
;
"
but
we
ask
your
permission
to
do
what
is
right
in
this
matter
by
giving
up
our
keys
.
<EOS>
When
Gabriel
Betteredge
sets
the
example
,
"
says
I
,
stopping
Superintendent
Seegrave
at
the
door
<EOS>
,
"
the
rest
of
the
servants
will
follow
,
I
promise
you
.
<EOS>
There
are
my
keys
,
to
begin
with
!
<EOS>
"
My
lady
took
me
by
the
hand
,
and
thanked
me
with
the
tears
in
her
eyes
.
<EOS>
Lord
!
<EOS>
what
would
I
not
have
given
,
at
that
moment
,
for
the
privilege
of
knocking
Superintendent
Seegrave
down
!
  
<EOS>
As
I
had
promised
for
them
,
the
other
servants
followed
my
lead
,
sorely
against
the
grain
,
of
course
,
but
all
taking
the
view
that
I
took
.
<EOS>
The
women
were
a
sight
to
see
,
while
the
police
-
officers
were
rummaging
among
their
things
.
<EOS>
The
cook
looked
as
if
she
could
grill
Mr.
Superintendent
alive
on
a
furnace
,
and
the
other
women
looked
as
if
they
could
eat
him
when
he
was
done
.
  
<EOS>
The
search
over
,
and
no
Diamond
or
sign
of
a
Diamond
being
found
,
of
course
,
anywhere
,
Superintendent
Seegrave
retired
to
my
little
room
to
consider
with
himself
what
he
was
to
do
next
.
<EOS>
He
and
his
men
had
now
been
hours
in
the
house
,
and
had
not
advanced
us
one
inch
towards
a
discovery
of
how
the
Moonstone
had
been
taken
,
or
of
whom
we
were
to
suspect
as
the
thief
.
  
<EOS>
While
the
police
-
officer
was
still
pondering
in
solitude
,
I
was
sent
for
to
see
Mr.
Franklin
in
the
library
.
<EOS>
To
my
unutterable
astonishment
,
just
as
my
hand
was
on
the
door
,
it
was
suddenly
opened
from
the
inside
,
and
out
walked
Rosanna
Spearman
!
  
<EOS>
After
the
library
had
been
swept
and
cleaned
in
the
morning
,
neither
first
nor
second
housemaid
had
any
business
in
that
room
at
any
later
period
of
the
day
.
<EOS>
I
stopped
Rosanna
Spearman
,
and
charged
her
with
a
breach
of
domestic
discipline
on
the
spot
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
might
you
want
in
the
library
at
this
time
of
day
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquired
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Franklin
Blake
dropped
one
of
his
rings
up
-
stairs
,
"
says
Rosanna
;
"
and
I
have
been
into
the
library
to
give
it
to
him
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
girl
's
face
was
all
in
a
flush
as
she
made
me
that
answer
;
and
she
walked
away
with
a
toss
of
her
head
and
a
look
of
self
-
importance
which
I
was
quite
at
a
loss
to
account
for
.
<EOS>
The
proceedings
in
the
house
had
doubtless
upset
all
the
women
-
servants
more
or
less
;
but
none
of
them
had
gone
clean
out
of
their
natural
characters
,
as
Rosanna
,
to
all
appearance
,
had
now
gone
out
of
hers
.
  
<EOS>
I
found
Mr.
Franklin
writing
at
the
library
-
table
.
<EOS>
He
asked
for
a
conveyance
to
the
railway
station
the
moment
I
entered
the
room
.
<EOS>
The
first
sound
of
his
voice
informed
me
that
we
now
had
the
resolute
side
of
him
uppermost
once
more
.
<EOS>
The
man
made
of
cotton
had
disappeared
;
and
the
man
made
of
iron
sat
before
me
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
Going
to
London
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
Going
to
telegraph
to
London
,
"
says
Mr.
Franklin
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
convinced
my
aunt
that
we
must
have
a
cleverer
head
than
Superintendent
Seegrave
's
to
help
us
;
and
I
have
got
her
permission
to
despatch
a
telegram
to
my
father
.
<EOS>
He
knows
the
Chief
Commissioner
of
Police
,
and
the
Commissioner
can
lay
his
hand
on
the
right
man
to
solve
the
mystery
of
the
Diamond
.
<EOS>
Talking
of
mysteries
,
by
-
the
-
bye
,
"
says
Mr.
Franklin
,
dropping
his
voice
,
"
I
have
another
word
to
say
to
you
before
you
go
to
the
stables
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
breathe
a
word
of
it
to
anybody
as
yet
;
but
either
Rosanna
Spearman
's
head
is
not
quite
right
,
or
I
am
afraid
she
knows
more
about
the
Moonstone
than
she
ought
to
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
can
hardly
tell
whether
I
was
more
startled
or
distressed
at
hearing
him
say
that
.
<EOS>
If
I
had
been
younger
,
I
might
have
confessed
as
much
to
Mr.
Franklin
.
<EOS>
But
when
you
are
old
,
you
acquire
one
excellent
habit
.
<EOS>
In
cases
where
you
do
n't
see
your
way
clearly
,
you
hold
your
tongue
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
came
in
here
with
a
ring
I
dropped
in
my
bed
-
room
,
"
Mr.
Franklin
went
on
.
<EOS>
"
When
I
had
thanked
her
,
of
course
I
expected
her
to
go
.
<EOS>
Instead
of
that
,
she
stood
opposite
to
me
at
the
table
,
looking
at
me
in
the
oddest
manner
 
half
frightened
,
and
half
familiar
 
<EOS>
I
could
n't
make
it
out
.
<EOS>
"
This
is
a
strange
thing
about
the
Diamond
,
sir
,
"
she
said
,
in
a
curiously
sudden
,
headlong
way
.
<EOS>
I
said
,
"
Yes
,
it
was
,
"
and
wondered
what
was
coming
next
.
<EOS>
Upon
my
honour
,
Betteredge
,
I
think
she
must
be
wrong
in
the
head
!
<EOS>
She
said
,
"
They
will
never
find
the
Diamond
,
sir
,
will
they
?
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
nor
the
person
who
took
it
 
I
'll
answer
for
that
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
actually
nodded
and
smiled
at
me
!
<EOS>
Before
I
could
ask
her
what
she
meant
,
we
heard
your
step
outside
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
she
was
afraid
of
your
catching
her
here
.
<EOS>
At
any
rate
,
she
changed
colour
,
and
left
the
room
.
<EOS>
What
on
earth
does
it
mean
?
<EOS>
"
  
I
could
not
bring
myself
to
tell
him
the
girl
's
story
,
even
then
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
been
almost
as
good
as
telling
him
that
she
was
the
thief
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
even
if
I
had
made
a
clean
breast
of
it
,
and
even
supposing
she
was
the
thief
,
the
reason
why
she
should
let
out
her
secret
to
Mr.
Franklin
,
of
all
the
people
in
the
world
,
would
have
been
still
as
far
to
seek
as
ever
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
bear
the
idea
of
getting
the
poor
girl
into
a
scrape
,
merely
because
she
has
a
flighty
way
with
her
,
and
talks
very
strangely
,
"
Mr.
Franklin
went
on
.
"
<EOS>
And
yet
if
she
had
said
to
,
the
Superintendent
<EOS>
what
she
said
to
me
,
fool
as
he
is
,
I
'm
afraid
 
<EOS>
"
He
stopped
there
,
and
left
the
rest
unspoken
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
best
way
,
sir
,
"
I
said
,
"
will
be
for
me
to
say
two
words
privately
to
my
mistress
about
it
at
the
first
opportunity
.
<EOS>
My
lady
has
a
very
friendly
interest
in
Rosanna
;
and
the
girl
may
only
have
been
forward
and
foolish
,
after
all
.
<EOS>
When
there
's
a
mess
of
any
kind
in
a
house
,
sir
,
the
women
-
servants
like
to
look
at
the
gloomy
side
 
<EOS>
it
gives
the
poor
wretches
a
kind
of
importance
in
their
own
eyes
.
<EOS>
If
there
's
anybody
ill
,
trust
the
women
for
prophesying
that
the
person
will
die
.
<EOS>
If
it
's
a
jewel
lost
,
trust
them
for
prophesying
that
it
will
never
be
found
again
.
"
  
<EOS>
This
view
(
which
I
am
bound
to
say
<EOS>
,
I
thought
a
probable
view
myself
,
on
reflection
)
seemed
to
relieve
Mr.
Franklin
mightily
:
he
folded
up
his
telegram
,
and
dismissed
the
subject
.
<EOS>
On
my
way
to
the
stables
,
to
order
the
pony
-
chaise
,
I
looked
in
at
the
servants
'
hall
,
where
they
were
at
dinner
.
<EOS>
Rosanna
Spearman
was
not
among
them
.
<EOS>
On
inquiry
,
I
found
that
she
had
been
suddenly
taken
ill
,
and
had
gone
up
-
stairs
to
her
own
room
to
lie
down
.
  
<EOS>
"
Curious
!
<EOS>
She
looked
well
enough
when
I
saw
her
last
,
"
I
remarked
.
  
<EOS>
Penelope
followed
me
out
.
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
talk
in
that
way
before
the
rest
of
them
,
father
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
You
only
make
them
harder
on
Rosanna
than
ever
.
<EOS>
The
poor
thing
is
breaking
her
heart
about
Mr.
Franklin
Blake
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Here
was
another
view
of
the
girl
's
conduct
.
<EOS>
If
it
was
possible
for
Penelope
to
be
right
,
the
explanation
of
Rosanna
's
strange
language
and
behaviour
might
have
been
all
in
this
 
that
she
did
n't
care
what
she
said
,
so
long
as
she
could
surprise
Mr.
Franklin
into
speaking
to
her
.
<EOS>
Granting
that
to
be
the
right
reading
of
the
riddle
,
it
accounted
,
perhaps
,
for
her
flighty
,
self
-
conceited
manner
when
she
passed
me
in
the
hall
.
<EOS>
Though
he
had
only
said
three
words
,
still
she
had
carried
her
point
,
and
Mr.
Franklin
had
spoken
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
I
saw
the
pony
harnessed
myself
.
<EOS>
In
the
infernal
network
of
mysteries
and
uncertainties
that
now
surrounded
us
,
I
declare
it
was
a
relief
to
observe
how
well
the
buckles
and
straps
understood
each
other
!
<EOS>
When
you
had
seen
the
pony
backed
into
the
shafts
of
the
chaise
,
you
had
seen
something
there
was
no
doubt
about
.
<EOS>
And
that
,
let
me
tell
you
,
was
becoming
a
treat
of
the
rarest
kind
in
our
household
.
  
<EOS>
Going
round
with
the
chaise
to
the
front
door
,
I
found
not
only
Mr.
Franklin
,
but
Mr.
Godfrey
and
Superintendent
Seegrave
also
waiting
for
me
on
the
steps
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Superintendent
's
reflections
(
after
failing
to
find
the
Diamond
in
the
servants
'
rooms
or
boxes
)
had
led
him
,
it
appeared
,
to
an
entirely
new
conclusion
.
<EOS>
Still
sticking
to
his
first
text
,
namely
,
that
somebody
in
the
house
had
stolen
the
jewel
,
our
experienced
officer
was
now
of
the
opinion
that
the
thief
(
he
was
wise
enough
not
to
name
poor
Penelope
,
whatever
he
might
privately
think
of
her
!
)
<EOS>
had
been
acting
in
concert
with
the
Indians
;
and
he
accordingly
proposed
shifting
his
inquiries
to
the
jugglers
in
the
prison
at
Frizinghall
.
<EOS>
Hearing
of
this
new
move
,
Mr.
Franklin
had
volunteered
to
take
the
Superintendent
back
to
the
town
,
from
which
he
could
telegraph
to
London
as
easily
as
from
our
station
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Godfrey
,
still
devoutly
believing
in
Mr.
Seegrave
,
and
greatly
interested
in
witnessing
the
examination
of
the
Indians
,
had
begged
leave
to
accompany
the
officer
to
Frizinghall
.
<EOS>
One
of
the
two
inferior
policemen
was
to
be
left
at
the
house
,
in
case
anything
happened
.
<EOS>
The
other
was
to
go
back
with
the
Superintendent
to
the
town
.
<EOS>
So
the
four
places
in
the
pony
-
chaise
were
just
filled
.
  
<EOS>
Before
he
took
the
reins
to
drive
off
,
Mr.
Franklin
walked
me
away
a
few
steps
out
of
hearing
of
the
others
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
wait
to
telegraph
to
London
,
"
he
said
,
"
<EOS>
till
I
see
what
comes
of
our
examination
of
the
Indians
.
<EOS>
My
own
conviction
is
,
that
this
muddle
-
headed
local
police
-
officer
is
as
much
in
the
dark
as
ever
,
and
is
simply
trying
to
gain
time
.
<EOS>
The
idea
of
any
of
the
servants
being
in
league
with
the
Indians
is
a
preposterous
absurdity
,
in
my
opinion
.
<EOS>
Keep
about
the
house
,
Betteredge
,
till
I
come
back
,
and
try
what
you
can
make
of
Rosanna
Spearman
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
ask
you
to
do
anything
degrading
to
your
own
self
-
respect
,
or
anything
cruel
towards
the
girl
.
<EOS>
I
only
ask
you
to
exercise
your
observation
more
carefully
than
usual
.
<EOS>
We
will
make
as
light
of
it
as
we
can
before
my
aunt
 
<EOS>
but
this
is
a
more
important
matter
than
you
may
suppose
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
It
is
a
matter
of
twenty
thousand
pounds
,
sir
,
"
I
said
,
thinking
of
the
value
of
the
Diamond
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
matter
of
quieting
Rachel
's
mind
,
"
answered
Mr.
Franklin
gravely
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
uneasy
about
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
left
me
suddenly
;
as
if
he
desired
to
cut
short
any
further
talk
between
us
.
<EOS>
I
thought
I
understood
why
.
<EOS>
Further
talk
might
have
let
me
into
the
secret
of
what
Miss
Rachel
had
said
to
him
on
the
terrace
.
  
<EOS>
So
they
drove
away
to
Frizinghall
.
<EOS>
I
was
ready
enough
,
in
the
girl
's
own
interest
,
to
have
a
little
talk
with
Rosanna
in
private
.
<EOS>
But
the
needful
opportunity
failed
to
present
itself
.
<EOS>
She
only
came
downstairs
again
at
tea
-
time
.
<EOS>
When
she
did
appear
,
she
was
flighty
and
excited
,
had
what
they
call
an
hysterical
attack
,
took
a
dose
of
sal
-
volatile
by
my
lady
's
order
,
and
was
sent
back
to
her
bed
.
  
<EOS>
The
day
wore
on
to
its
end
drearily
and
miserably
enough
,
I
can
tell
you
.
<EOS>
Miss
Rachel
still
kept
her
room
,
declaring
that
she
was
too
ill
to
come
down
to
dinner
that
day
.
<EOS>
My
lady
was
in
such
low
spirits
about
her
daughter
,
that
I
could
not
bring
myself
to
make
her
additionally
anxious
,
by
reporting
what
Rosanna
Spearman
had
said
to
Mr.
Franklin
.
<EOS>
Penelope
persisted
in
believing
that
she
was
to
be
forthwith
tried
,
sentenced
,
and
transported
for
theft
.
<EOS>
The
other
women
took
to
their
Bibles
and
hymn
-
books
,
and
looked
as
sour
as
verjuice
over
their
reading
 
a
result
,
which
I
have
observed
,
in
my
sphere
of
life
,
to
follow
generally
on
the
performance
of
acts
of
piety
at
unaccustomed
periods
of
the
day
.
<EOS>
As
for
me
,
I
had
n't
even
heart
enough
to
open
my
ROBINSON
CRUSOE
.
<EOS>
I
went
out
into
the
yard
,
and
,
being
hard
up
for
a
little
cheerful
society
,
set
my
chair
by
the
kennels
,
and
talked
to
the
dogs
.
  
<EOS>
Half
an
hour
before
dinner
-
time
,
the
two
gentlemen
came
back
from
Frizinghall
,
having
arranged
with
Superintendent
Seegrave
that
he
was
to
return
to
us
the
next
day
.
<EOS>
They
had
called
on
Mr.
Murthwaite
,
the
Indian
traveller
,
at
his
present
residence
,
near
the
town
.
<EOS>
At
Mr.
Franklin
's
request
,
he
had
kindly
given
them
the
benefit
of
his
knowledge
of
the
language
,
in
dealing
with
those
two
,
out
of
the
three
Indians
,
who
knew
nothing
of
English
.
<EOS>
The
examination
,
conducted
carefully
,
and
at
great
length
,
had
ended
in
nothing
;
not
the
shadow
of
a
reason
being
discovered
for
suspecting
the
jugglers
of
having
tampered
with
any
of
our
servants
.
<EOS>
On
reaching
that
conclusion
,
Mr.
Franklin
had
sent
his
telegraphic
message
to
London
,
and
there
the
matter
now
rested
till
to
-
morrow
came
.
  
<EOS>
So
much
for
the
history
of
the
day
that
followed
the
birthday
.
<EOS>
Not
a
glimmer
of
light
had
broken
in
on
us
,
so
far
.
<EOS>
A
day
or
two
after
,
however
,
the
darkness
lifted
a
little
.
<EOS>
How
,
and
with
what
result
,
you
shall
presently
see
.
    
<EOS>
The
Thursday
night
passed
,
and
nothing
happened
.
<EOS>
With
the
Friday
morning
came
two
pieces
of
news
.
  
<EOS>
Item
<EOS>
the
first
:
the
baker
's
man
declared
he
had
met
Rosanna
Spearman
,
on
the
previous
afternoon
,
with
a
thick
veil
on
,
walking
towards
Frizinghall
by
the
foot
-
path
way
over
the
moor
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
strange
that
anybody
should
be
mistaken
about
Rosanna
,
whose
shoulder
marked
her
out
pretty
plainly
,
poor
thing
 
<EOS>
but
mistaken
the
man
<EOS>
must
have
been
;
for
Rosanna
,
as
you
know
,
had
been
all
the
Thursday
afternoon
ill
up
-
stairs
in
her
room
.
  
<EOS>
Item
the
second
came
through
the
postman
.
<EOS>
Worthy
Mr.
Candy
had
said
one
more
of
his
many
unlucky
things
,
when
he
drove
off
in
the
rain
on
the
birthday
night
,
and
told
me
that
a
doctor
's
skin
was
waterproof
.
<EOS>
In
spite
of
his
skin
,
the
wet
had
got
through
him
.
<EOS>
He
had
caught
a
chill
that
night
,
and
was
now
down
with
a
fever
.
<EOS>
The
last
accounts
,
brought
by
the
postman
,
represented
him
to
be
light
-
headed
 
<EOS>
talking
nonsense
as
glibly
,
poor
man
,
in
his
delirium
as
he
often
talked
it
in
his
sober
senses
.
<EOS>
We
were
all
sorry
for
the
little
doctor
;
but
Mr.
Franklin
appeared
to
regret
his
illness
,
chiefly
on
Miss
Rachel
's
account
.
<EOS>
From
what
he
said
to
my
lady
,
while
I
was
in
the
room
at
breakfast
-
time
,
he
appeared
to
think
that
Miss
Rachel
 
if
the
suspense
about
the
Moonstone
was
not
soon
set
at
rest
 
might
stand
in
urgent
need
of
the
best
medical
advice
at
our
disposal
.
  
<EOS>
Breakfast
had
not
been
over
long
,
when
a
telegram
from
Mr.
Blake
,
the
elder
,
arrived
,
in
answer
to
his
son
.
<EOS>
It
informed
us
that
he
had
laid
hands
(
by
help
of
his
friend
,
the
Commissioner
)
on
the
right
man
to
help
us
.
<EOS>
The
name
of
him
was
Sergeant
Cuff
;
and
the
arrival
of
him
from
London
might
be
expected
by
the
morning
train
.
  
<EOS>
At
reading
the
name
of
the
new
police
-
officer
,
Mr.
Franklin
gave
a
start
.
<EOS>
It
seems
that
he
had
heard
some
curious
anecdotes
about
Sergeant
Cuff
,
from
his
father
's
lawyer
,
during
his
stay
in
London
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
begin
to
hope
we
are
seeing
the
end
of
our
anxieties
already
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
If
half
the
stories
I
have
heard
are
true
,
when
it
comes
to
unravelling
a
mystery
,
there
is
n't
the
equal
in
England
of
Sergeant
Cuff
!
"
  
<EOS>
We
all
got
excited
and
impatient
as
the
time
drew
near
for
the
appearance
of
this
renowned
and
capable
character
.
<EOS>
Superintendent
Seegrave
,
returning
to
us
at
his
appointed
time
,
and
hearing
that
the
Sergeant
was
expected
,
instantly
shut
himself
up
in
a
room
,
with
pen
,
ink
,
and
paper
,
to
make
notes
of
the
Report
which
would
be
certainly
expected
from
him
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
liked
to
have
gone
to
the
station
myself
,
to
fetch
the
Sergeant
.
<EOS>
But
my
lady
's
carriage
and
horses
were
not
to
be
thought
of
,
even
for
the
celebrated
Cuff
;
and
the
pony
-
chaise
was
required
later
for
Mr.
Godfrey
.
<EOS>
He
deeply
regretted
being
obliged
to
leave
his
aunt
at
such
an
anxious
time
;
and
he
kindly
put
off
the
hour
of
his
departure
till
as
late
as
the
last
train
,
for
the
purpose
of
hearing
what
the
clever
London
police
-
officer
thought
of
the
case
.
<EOS>
But
on
Friday
night
he
must
be
in
town
,
having
a
Ladies
'
Charity
,
in
difficulties
,
waiting
to
consult
him
on
Saturday
morning
.
  
<EOS>
When
the
time
came
for
the
Sergeant
's
arrival
,
I
went
down
to
the
gate
to
look
out
for
him
.
  
<EOS>
A
fly
from
the
railway
drove
up
as
I
reached
the
lodge
;
and
out
got
a
grizzled
,
elderly
man
,
so
miserably
lean
that
he
looked
as
if
he
had
not
got
an
ounce
of
flesh
on
his
bones
in
any
part
of
him
.
<EOS>
He
was
dressed
all
in
decent
black
,
with
a
white
cravat
round
his
neck
.
<EOS>
His
face
was
as
sharp
as
a
hatchet
,
and
the
skin
of
it
was
as
yellow
and
dry
and
withered
as
an
autumn
leaf
.
<EOS>
His
eyes
,
of
a
steely
light
grey
,
had
a
very
disconcerting
trick
,
when
they
encountered
your
eyes
,
of
looking
as
if
they
expected
something
more
from
you
than
you
were
aware
of
yourself
.
<EOS>
His
walk
was
soft
;
his
voice
was
melancholy
;
his
long
lanky
fingers
were
hooked
like
claws
.
<EOS>
He
might
have
been
a
parson
,
or
an
undertaker
 
or
anything
else
you
like
,
except
what
he
really
was
.
<EOS>
A
more
complete
opposite
to
Superintendent
Seegrave
than
Sergeant
Cuff
,
and
a
less
comforting
officer
to
look
at
,
for
a
family
in
distress
,
I
defy
you
to
discover
,
search
where
you
may
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
this
Lady
Verinder
's
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
Sergeant
Cuff
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
This
way
,
sir
,
if
you
please
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
On
our
road
to
the
house
,
I
mentioned
my
name
and
position
in
the
family
,
to
satisfy
him
that
he
might
speak
to
me
about
the
business
on
which
my
lady
was
to
employ
him
.
<EOS>
Not
a
word
<EOS>
did
he
say
about
the
business
,
however
,
for
all
that
.
<EOS>
He
admired
the
grounds
,
and
remarked
that
he
felt
the
sea
air
very
brisk
and
refreshing
.
<EOS>
I
privately
wondered
,
on
my
side
,
how
the
celebrated
Cuff
had
got
his
reputation
.
<EOS>
We
reached
the
house
,
in
the
temper
of
two
strange
dogs
,
coupled
up
together
for
the
first
time
in
their
lives
by
the
same
chain
.
  
<EOS>
Asking
for
my
lady
,
and
hearing
that
she
was
in
one
of
the
conservatories
,
we
went
round
to
the
gardens
at
the
back
,
and
sent
a
servant
to
seek
her
.
<EOS>
While
we
were
waiting
,
Sergeant
Cuff
looked
through
the
evergreen
arch
on
our
left
,
spied
out
our
rosery
,
and
walked
straight
in
,
with
the
first
appearance
of
anything
like
interest
that
he
had
shown
yet
.
<EOS>
To
the
gardener
's
astonishment
,
and
to
my
disgust
,
this
celebrated
policeman
proved
to
be
quite
a
mine
of
learning
on
the
trumpery
subject
of
rose
-
gardens
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
you
've
got
the
right
exposure
here
to
the
south
and
sou'-west
,
"
says
the
Sergeant
,
with
a
wag
of
his
grizzled
head
,
and
a
streak
of
pleasure
in
his
melancholy
voice
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
This
is
the
shape
for
a
rosery
 
<EOS>
nothing
like
a
circle
set
in
a
square
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
yes
;
with
walks
between
all
the
beds
.
<EOS>
But
they
ought
n't
to
be
gravel
walks
like
these
.
<EOS>
Grass
,
Mr.
Gardener
 
grass
walks
between
your
roses
;
gravel
's
too
hard
for
them
.
<EOS>
That
's
a
sweet
pretty
bed
of
white
roses
and
blush
roses
.
<EOS>
They
always
mix
well
together
,
do
n't
they
?
<EOS>
Here
's
the
white
musk
rose
,
Mr.
Betteredge
 
<EOS>
our
old
English
rose
holding
up
its
head
along
with
the
best
and
the
newest
of
them
.
<EOS>
Pretty
dear
!
"
says
the
Sergeant
,
fondling
the
Musk
Rose
with
his
lanky
fingers
,
and
speaking
to
it
as
if
he
was
speaking
to
a
child
.
  
<EOS>
This
was
a
nice
sort
of
man
to
recover
Miss
Rachel
's
Diamond
,
and
to
find
out
the
thief
who
stole
it
!
  
<EOS>
"
You
seem
to
be
fond
of
roses
,
Sergeant
?
<EOS>
"
I
remarked
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
n't
much
time
to
be
fond
of
anything
,
"
says
Sergeant
Cuff
.
<EOS>
"
But
when
I
_
have
_
a
moment
's
fondness
to
bestow
,
most
times
,
Mr.
Betteredge
,
the
roses
get
it
.
<EOS>
I
began
my
life
among
them
in
my
father
's
nursery
garden
,
and
I
shall
end
my
life
among
them
,
if
I
can
.
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
One
of
these
days
(
please
God
)
<EOS>
I
shall
retire
from
catching
thieves
,
and
try
my
hand
at
growing
roses
.
<EOS>
There
will
be
grass
walks
,
Mr.
Gardener
,
between
my
beds
,
"
says
the
Sergeant
,
on
whose
mind
the
gravel
paths
of
our
rosery
seemed
to
dwell
unpleasantly
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
seems
an
odd
taste
,
sir
,
"
I
ventured
to
say
,
"
for
a
man
in
your
line
of
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
will
look
about
you
(
which
most
people
wo
n't
do
)
,
"
says
Sergeant
Cuff
,
"
you
will
see
that
the
nature
of
a
man
's
tastes
is
,
most
times
,
as
opposite
as
possible
to
the
nature
of
a
man
's
business
.
<EOS>
Show
me
any
two
things
more
opposite
one
from
the
other
than
a
rose
and
a
thief
;
and
I
'll
correct
my
tastes
accordingly
 
if
it
is
n't
too
late
at
my
time
of
life
.
<EOS>
You
find
the
damask
rose
a
goodish
stock
for
most
of
the
tender
sorts
,
do
n't
you
,
Mr.
Gardener
?
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
I
thought
so
.
<EOS>
Here
's
a
lady
coming
.
<EOS>
Is
it
Lady
Verinder
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
had
seen
her
before
either
I
or
the
gardener
had
seen
her
,
though
we
knew
which
way
to
look
,
and
he
did
n't
.
<EOS>
I
began
to
think
him
rather
a
quicker
man
than
he
appeared
to
be
at
first
sight
.
  
<EOS>
The
Sergeant
's
appearance
,
or
the
Sergeant
's
errand
 
<EOS>
one
or
both
 
seemed
to
cause
my
lady
some
little
embarrassment
.
<EOS>
She
was
,
for
the
first
time
in
all
my
experience
of
her
,
at
a
loss
what
to
say
at
an
interview
with
a
stranger
.
<EOS>
Sergeant
Cuff
put
her
at
her
ease
directly
.
<EOS>
He
asked
if
any
other
person
had
been
employed
about
the
robbery
before
we
sent
for
him
;
and
hearing
that
another
person
had
been
called
in
,
and
was
now
in
the
house
,
begged
leave
to
speak
to
him
before
anything
else
was
done
.
  
<EOS>
My
lady
led
the
way
back
.
<EOS>
Before
he
followed
her
,
the
Sergeant
relieved
his
mind
on
the
subject
of
the
gravel
walks
by
a
parting
word
to
the
gardener
.
<EOS>
"
Get
her
ladyship
to
try
grass
,
"
he
said
,
with
a
sour
look
at
the
paths
.
"
<EOS>
No
gravel
!
<EOS>
no
gravel
!
"
  
<EOS>
Why
Superintendent
Seegrave
should
have
appeared
to
be
several
sizes
smaller
than
life
,
on
being
presented
to
Sergeant
Cuff
,
I
ca
n't
undertake
to
explain
.
<EOS>
I
can
only
state
the
fact
.
<EOS>
They
retired
together
;
and
remained
a
weary
long
time
shut
up
from
all
mortal
intrusion
.
<EOS>
When
they
came
out
,
Mr.
Superintendent
was
excited
,
and
Mr.
Sergeant
was
yawning
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
Sergeant
wishes
to
see
Miss
Verinder
's
sitting
-
room
,
"
says
Mr.
Seegrave
,
addressing
me
with
great
pomp
and
eagerness
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
Sergeant
may
have
some
questions
to
ask
.
<EOS>
Attend
the
Sergeant
,
if
you
please
!
"
  
<EOS>
While
I
was
being
ordered
about
in
this
way
,
I
looked
at
the
great
Cuff
.
<EOS>
The
great
Cuff
,
on
his
side
,
looked
at
Superintendent
Seegrave
in
that
quietly
expecting
way
which
I
have
already
noticed
.
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
affirm
that
he
was
on
the
watch
for
his
brother
officer
's
speedy
appearance
in
the
character
of
<EOS>
an
Ass
 
I
can
only
say
that
I
strongly
suspected
it
.
  
<EOS>
I
led
the
way
up
-
stairs
.
<EOS>
The
Sergeant
went
softly
all
over
the
Indian
cabinet
and
all
round
the
"
boudoir
;
"
asking
questions
(
occasionally
only
of
Mr.
Superintendent
,
and
continually
of
me
)
,
the
drift
of
which
I
believe
to
have
been
equally
unintelligible
to
both
of
us
.
<EOS>
In
due
time
,
his
course
brought
him
to
the
door
,
and
put
him
face
to
face
with
the
decorative
painting
that
you
know
of
.
<EOS>
He
laid
one
lean
inquiring
finger
on
the
small
smear
,
just
under
the
lock
,
which
Superintendent
Seegrave
had
already
noticed
,
when
he
reproved
the
women
-
servants
for
all
crowding
together
into
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
a
pity
,
"
says
Sergeant
Cuff
.
<EOS>
"
How
did
it
happen
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
put
the
question
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
answered
that
the
women
-
servants
had
crowded
into
the
room
on
the
previous
morning
,
and
that
some
of
their
petticoats
had
done
the
mischief
,
"
Superintendent
Seegrave
ordered
them
out
,
sir
,
"
I
added
,
"
before
they
did
any
more
harm
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
Right
!
<EOS>
"
says
Mr.
Superintendent
in
his
military
way
.
<EOS>
"
I
ordered
them
out
.
<EOS>
The
petticoats
did
it
,
Sergeant
 
<EOS>
the
petticoats
did
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
you
notice
which
petticoat
did
it
?
"
asked
Sergeant
Cuff
,
still
addressing
himself
,
not
to
his
brother
-
officer
,
but
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
turned
to
Superintendent
Seegrave
upon
that
,
and
said
,
"
You
noticed
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Superintendent
looked
a
little
taken
aback
;
but
he
made
the
best
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
charge
my
memory
,
Sergeant
,
"
he
said
,
"
a
mere
trifle
 
a
mere
trifle
.
"
  
<EOS>
Sergeant
Cuff
looked
at
Mr.
Seegrave
,
as
he
had
looked
at
the
gravel
walks
in
the
rosery
,
and
gave
us
,
in
his
melancholy
way
,
the
first
taste
of
his
quality
which
we
had
had
yet
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
made
a
private
inquiry
last
week
,
Mr.
Superintendent
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
At
one
end
of
the
inquiry
there
was
a
murder
,
and
at
the
other
end
there
was
a
spot
of
ink
on
a
table
cloth
that
nobody
could
account
for
.
<EOS>
In
all
my
experience
along
the
dirtiest
ways
of
this
dirty
little
world
,
I
have
never
met
with
such
a
thing
as
a
trifle
yet
.
<EOS>
Before
we
go
a
step
further
in
this
business
we
must
see
the
petticoat
that
made
the
smear
,
and
we
must
know
for
certain
when
that
paint
was
wet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Superintendent
 
taking
his
set
-
down
rather
sulkily
 
asked
if
he
should
summon
the
women
.
<EOS>
Sergeant
Cuff
,
after
considering
a
minute
,
sighed
,
and
shook
his
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
he
said
,
"
we
'll
take
the
matter
of
the
paint
first
.
<EOS>
It
's
a
question
of
Yes
or
No
<EOS>
with
the
paint
 
which
is
short
.
<EOS>
It
's
a
question
of
petticoats
with
the
women
 
which
is
long
.
<EOS>
What
o'clock
was
it
when
the
servants
were
in
this
room
yesterday
morning
?
<EOS>
Eleven
o'clock
 
eh
?
<EOS>
Is
there
anybody
in
the
house
who
knows
whether
that
paint
was
wet
or
dry
,
at
eleven
yesterday
morning
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Her
ladyship
's
nephew
,
Mr.
Franklin
Blake
,
knows
,
"
I
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
the
gentleman
in
the
house
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Franklin
was
as
close
at
hand
as
could
be
 
waiting
for
his
first
chance
of
being
introduced
to
the
great
Cuff
.
<EOS>
In
half
a
minute
he
was
in
the
room
,
and
was
giving
his
evidence
as
follows
:
  
<EOS>
"
That
door
,
Sergeant
,
"
he
said
,
"
has
been
painted
by
Miss
Verinder
,
under
my
inspection
,
with
my
help
,
and
in
a
vehicle
of
my
own
composition
.
<EOS>
The
vehicle
dries
whatever
colours
may
be
used
with
it
,
in
twelve
hours
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
you
remember
when
the
smeared
bit
was
done
,
sir
?
"
asked
the
Sergeant
.
  
<EOS>
"
Perfectly
,
"
answered
Mr.
Franklin
.
<EOS>
"
That
was
the
last
morsel
of
the
door
to
be
finished
.
<EOS>
We
wanted
to
get
it
done
,
on
Wednesday
last
 
<EOS>
and
I
myself
completed
it
by
three
in
the
afternoon
,
or
soon
after
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
To
-
day
is
Friday
,
"
said
Sergeant
Cuff
,
addressing
himself
to
Superintendent
Seegrave
.
<EOS>
"
Let
us
reckon
back
,
sir
.
<EOS>
At
three
on
the
Wednesday
afternoon
,
that
bit
of
the
painting
was
completed
.
<EOS>
The
vehicle
dried
it
in
twelve
hours
 
that
is
to
say
,
dried
it
by
three
o'clock
on
Thursday
morning
.
<EOS>
At
eleven
on
Thursday
morning
you
held
your
inquiry
here
.
<EOS>
Take
three
from
eleven
,
and
eight
remains
.
<EOS>
That
paint
had
been
EIGHT
HOURS
DRY
,
Mr.
Superintendent
,
when
you
supposed
that
the
women
-
servants
'
petticoats
smeared
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
First
knock
-
down
blow
for
Mr.
Seegrave
!
<EOS>
If
he
had
not
suspected
poor
Penelope
,
I
should
have
pitied
him
.
  
<EOS>
Having
settled
the
question
of
the
paint
,
Sergeant
Cuff
,
from
that
moment
,
gave
his
brother
-
officer
up
as
a
bad
job
 
and
addressed
himself
to
Mr.
Franklin
,
as
the
more
promising
assistant
of
the
two
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
quite
on
the
cards
,
sir
,
"
he
said
,
"
that
you
have
put
the
clue
into
our
hands
.
"
  
<EOS>
As
the
words
passed
his
lips
,
the
bedroom
door
opened
,
and
Miss
Rachel
came
out
among
us
suddenly
.
  
<EOS>
She
addressed
herself
to
the
Sergeant
,
without
appearing
to
notice
(
or
to
heed
)
that
he
was
a
perfect
stranger
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Did
you
say
,
"
she
asked
,
pointing
to
Mr.
Franklin
,
"
that
HE
had
put
the
clue
into
your
hands
?
"
  
<EOS>
(
"
This
is
Miss
Verinder
,
"
I
whispered
,
behind
the
Sergeant
.
)
  
<EOS>
"
That
gentleman
,
miss
,
"
says
the
Sergeant
 
with
his
steely
-
grey
eyes
carefully
studying
my
young
lady
's
face
 
"
has
possibly
put
the
clue
into
our
hands
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
turned
for
one
moment
,
and
tried
to
look
at
Mr.
Franklin
.
<EOS>
I
say
,
tried
,
for
she
suddenly
looked
away
again
before
their
eyes
met
.
<EOS>
There
seemed
to
be
some
strange
disturbance
in
her
mind
.
<EOS>
She
coloured
up
,
and
then
she
turned
pale
again
.
<EOS>
With
the
paleness
,
there
came
a
new
look
into
her
face
 
<EOS>
a
look
which
it
startled
me
to
see
.
  
<EOS>
"
Having
answered
your
question
,
miss
,
"
says
the
Sergeant
,
"
I
beg
leave
to
make
an
inquiry
in
my
turn
.
<EOS>
There
is
a
smear
on
the
painting
of
your
door
,
here
.
<EOS>
Do
you
happen
to
know
when
it
was
done
?
<EOS>
or
who
did
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Instead
of
making
any
reply
,
Miss
Rachel
went
on
with
her
questions
,
as
if
he
had
not
spoken
,
or
as
if
she
had
not
heard
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
another
police
-
officer
?
"
she
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
Sergeant
Cuff
,
miss
,
of
the
Detective
Police
.
<EOS>
"

"
Do
you
think
a
young
lady
's
advice
worth
having
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
glad
to
hear
it
,
miss
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
your
duty
by
yourself
 
and
do
n't
allow
Mr
Franklin
Blake
to
help
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
said
those
words
so
spitefully
,
so
savagely
,
with
such
an
extraordinary
outbreak
of
ill
-
will
towards
Mr.
Franklin
,
in
her
voice
and
in
her
look
,
that
 
though
I
had
known
her
from
a
baby
,
though
I
loved
and
honoured
her
next
to
my
lady
herself
 
<EOS>
I
was
ashamed
of
Miss
Rachel
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
.
  
<EOS>
Sergeant
Cuff
's
immovable
eyes
never
stirred
from
off
her
face
.
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
miss
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
Do
you
happen
to
know
anything
about
the
smear
?
<EOS>
Might
you
have
done
it
by
accident
yourself
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
nothing
about
the
smear
.
"
  
<EOS>
With
that
answer
,
she
turned
away
,
and
shut
herself
up
again
in
her
bed
-
room
.
<EOS>
This
time
,
I
heard
her
 
as
Penelope
had
heard
her
before
 
burst
out
crying
as
soon
as
she
was
alone
again
.
  
<EOS>
I
could
n't
bring
myself
to
look
at
the
Sergeant
 
<EOS>
I
looked
at
Mr.
Franklin
,
who
stood
nearest
to
me
.
<EOS>
He
seemed
to
be
even
more
sorely
distressed
at
what
had
passed
than
I
was
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
told
you
I
was
uneasy
about
her
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
And
now
you
see
why
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Miss
Verinder
appears
to
be
a
little
out
of
temper
about
the
loss
of
her
Diamond
,
"
remarked
the
Sergeant
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
valuable
jewel
.
<EOS>
Natural
enough
!
<EOS>
natural
enough
!
"
  
<EOS>
Here
was
the
excuse
that
I
had
made
for
her
(
when
she
forgot
herself
before
Superintendent
Seegrave
,
on
the
previous
day
)
being
made
for
her
over
again
,
by
a
man
who
could
n't
have
had
MY
interest
in
making
it
 
for
he
was
a
perfect
stranger
!
<EOS>
A
kind
of
cold
shudder
ran
through
me
,
which
I
could
n't
account
for
at
the
time
.
<EOS>
I
know
,
now
,
that
I
must
have
got
my
first
suspicion
,
at
that
moment
,
of
a
new
light
(
and
horrid
light
)
having
suddenly
fallen
on
the
case
,
in
the
mind
of
Sergeant
Cuff
 
purely
and
entirely
in
consequence
of
what
he
had
seen
in
Miss
Rachel
,
and
heard
from
Miss
Rachel
,
at
that
first
interview
between
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
young
lady
's
tongue
is
a
privileged
member
,
sir
,
"
says
the
Sergeant
to
Mr.
Franklin
.
<EOS>
"
Let
us
forget
what
has
passed
,
and
go
straight
on
with
this
business
.
<EOS>
Thanks
to
you
,
we
know
when
the
paint
was
dry
.
<EOS>
The
next
thing
to
discover
is
when
the
paint
was
last
seen
without
that
smear
.
<EOS>
YOU
have
got
a
head
on
your
shoulders
 
<EOS>
and
you
understand
what
I
mean
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Franklin
composed
himself
,
and
came
back
with
an
effort
from
Miss
Rachel
to
the
matter
in
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
do
understand
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
The
more
we
narrow
the
question
of
time
,
the
more
we
also
narrow
the
field
of
inquiry
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
it
,
sir
,
"
said
the
Sergeant
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Did
you
notice
your
work
here
,
on
the
Wednesday
afternoon
,
after
you
had
done
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Franklin
shook
his
head
,
and
answered
,
"
I
ca
n't
say
I
did
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
you
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Sergeant
Cuff
,
turning
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
say
I
did
either
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Who
was
the
last
person
in
the
room
,
the
last
thing
on
Wednesday
night
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Rachel
,
I
suppose
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Franklin
struck
in
there
,
"
Or
possibly
your
daughter
,
Betteredge
.
"
<EOS>
He
turned
to
Sergeant
Cuff
,
and
explained
that
my
daughter
was
Miss
Verinder
's
maid
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Betteredge
,
ask
your
daughter
to
step
up
.
<EOS>
Stop
!
<EOS>
"
says
the
Sergeant
,
taking
me
away
to
the
window
,
out
of
earshot
,
"
Your
Superintendent
here
<EOS>
,
"
he
went
on
,
in
a
whisper
,
"
has
made
a
pretty
full
report
to
me
of
the
manner
in
which
he
has
managed
this
case
.
<EOS>
Among
other
things
,
he
has
,
by
his
own
confession
,
set
the
servants
'
backs
up
.
<EOS>
It
's
very
important
to
smooth
them
down
again
.
<EOS>
Tell
your
daughter
,
and
tell
the
rest
of
them
,
these
two
things
,
with
my
compliments
:
First
,
that
I
have
no
evidence
before
me
,
yet
,
that
the
Diamond
has
been
stolen
;
I
only
know
that
the
Diamond
has
been
lost
.
<EOS>
Second
,
that
my
business
here
with
the
servants
is
simply
to
ask
them
to
lay
their
heads
together
and
help
me
to
find
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
My
experience
of
the
women
-
servants
,
when
Superintendent
Seegrave
laid
his
embargo
on
their
rooms
,
came
in
handy
here
.
  
<EOS>
"
May
I
make
so
bold
,
Sergeant
,
as
to
tell
the
women
a
third
thing
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
"
<EOS>
Are
they
free
(
with
your
compliments
)
to
fidget
up
and
downstairs
,
and
whisk
in
and
out
of
their
bed
-
rooms
,
if
the
fit
takes
them
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Perfectly
free
,
"
said
the
Sergeant
.
  
<EOS>
"
THAT
will
smooth
them
down
,
sir
,
"
I
remarked
,
"
from
the
cook
to
the
scullion
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Go
,
and
do
it
at
once
,
Mr.
Betteredge
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
did
it
in
less
than
five
minutes
.
<EOS>
There
was
only
one
difficulty
when
I
came
to
the
bit
about
the
bed
-
rooms
.
<EOS>
It
took
a
pretty
stiff
exertion
of
my
authority
,
as
chief
,
to
prevent
the
whole
of
the
female
household
from
following
me
and
Penelope
up
-
stairs
,
in
the
character
of
volunteer
witnesses
in
a
burning
fever
of
anxiety
to
help
Sergeant
Cuff
.
  
<EOS>
The
Sergeant
seemed
to
approve
of
Penelope
.
<EOS>
He
became
a
trifle
less
dreary
;
and
he
looked
much
as
he
had
looked
when
he
noticed
the
white
musk
rose
in
the
flower
-
garden
.
<EOS>
Here
is
my
daughter
's
evidence
,
as
drawn
off
from
her
by
the
Sergeant
.
<EOS>
She
gave
it
,
I
think
,
very
prettily
 
<EOS>
but
,
there
!
<EOS>
she
is
my
child
all
over
:
nothing
of
her
mother
in
her
;
Lord
bless
you
,
nothing
of
her
mother
in
her
!
  
<EOS>
Penelope
examined
:
Took
a
lively
interest
in
the
painting
on
the
door
,
having
helped
to
mix
the
colours
.
<EOS>
Noticed
the
bit
of
work
under
the
lock
,
because
it
was
the
last
bit
done
.
<EOS>
Had
seen
it
,
some
hours
afterwards
,
without
a
smear
.
<EOS>
Had
left
it
,
as
late
as
twelve
at
night
,
without
a
smear
.
<EOS>
Had
,
at
that
hour
,
wished
her
young
lady
good
night
in
the
bedroom
;
had
heard
the
clock
strike
in
the
"
boudoir
"
;
had
her
hand
at
the
time
on
the
handle
of
the
painted
door
;
knew
the
paint
was
wet
(
having
helped
to
mix
the
colours
,
as
aforesaid
)
;
took
particular
pains
not
to
touch
it
;
could
swear
that
she
held
up
the
skirts
of
her
dress
,
and
that
there
was
no
smear
on
the
paint
then
;
could
not
swear
that
her
dress
might
n't
have
touched
it
accidentally
in
going
out
;
remembered
the
dress
she
had
on
,
because
it
was
new
,
a
present
from
Miss
Rachel
;
her
father
remembered
,
and
could
speak
to
it
,
too
;
could
,
and
would
,
and
did
fetch
it
;
dress
recognised
by
her
father
as
the
dress
she
wore
that
night
;
skirts
examined
,
a
long
job
from
the
size
of
them
;
not
the
ghost
of
a
paint
-
stain
discovered
anywhere
.
<EOS>
End
of
Penelope
's
evidence
 
and
very
pretty
and
convincing
,
too
.
<EOS>
Signed
,
Gabriel
Betteredge
.
  
<EOS>
The
Sergeant
's
next
proceeding
was
to
question
me
about
any
large
dogs
in
the
house
who
might
have
got
into
the
room
,
and
done
the
mischief
with
a
whisk
of
their
tails
.
<EOS>
Hearing
that
this
was
impossible
,
he
next
sent
for
a
magnifying
-
glass
,
and
tried
how
the
smear
looked
,
seen
that
way
.
<EOS>
No
skin
-
mark
(
as
of
a
human
hand
)
printed
off
on
the
paint
.
<EOS>
All
the
signs
visible
 
signs
which
told
that
the
paint
had
been
smeared
by
some
loose
article
of
somebody
's
dress
touching
it
in
going
by
.
<EOS>
That
somebody
(
putting
together
Penelope
's
evidence
and
Mr.
Franklin
's
evidence
)
must
have
been
in
the
room
,
and
done
the
mischief
,
between
midnight
and
three
o'clock
on
the
Thursday
morning
.
  
<EOS>
Having
brought
his
investigation
to
this
point
,
Sergeant
Cuff
discovered
that
such
a
person
as
Superintendent
Seegrave
was
still
left
in
the
room
,
upon
which
he
summed
up
the
proceedings
for
his
brother
-
officer
's
benefit
,
as
follows
:
  
"
This
trifle
of
yours
,
Mr.
Superintendent
,
"
says
the
Sergeant
,
pointing
to
the
place
on
the
door
,
"
has
grown
a
little
in
importance
since
you
noticed
it
last
.
<EOS>
At
the
present
stage
of
the
inquiry
there
are
,
as
I
take
it
,
three
discoveries
to
make
,
starting
from
that
smear
.
<EOS>
Find
out
(
first
)
whether
there
is
any
article
of
dress
in
this
house
with
the
smear
of
the
paint
on
it
.
<EOS>
Find
out
(
second
)
who
that
dress
belongs
to
.
<EOS>
Find
out
(
third
)
how
the
person
can
account
for
having
been
in
this
room
,
and
smeared
the
paint
,
between
midnight
and
three
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
If
the
person
ca
n't
satisfy
you
,
you
have
n't
far
to
look
for
the
hand
that
has
got
the
Diamond
.
<EOS>
I
'll
work
this
by
myself
,
if
you
please
,
and
detain
you
no
longer
-
from
your
regular
business
in
the
town
.
<EOS>
You
have
got
one
of
your
men
here
,
I
see
.
<EOS>
Leave
him
here
at
my
disposal
,
in
case
I
want
him
 
and
allow
me
to
wish
you
good
morning
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Superintendent
Seegrave
's
respect
for
the
Sergeant
was
great
;
but
his
respect
for
himself
was
greater
still
.
<EOS>
Hit
hard
by
the
celebrated
Cuff
,
he
hit
back
smartly
,
to
the
best
of
his
ability
,
on
leaving
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
abstained
from
expressing
any
opinion
,
so
far
,
"
says
Mr.
Superintendent
,
with
his
military
voice
still
in
good
working
order
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
now
only
one
remark
to
offer
on
leaving
this
case
in
your
hands
.
<EOS>
There
IS
such
a
thing
,
Sergeant
,
as
making
a
mountain
out
of
a
molehill
.
<EOS>
Good
morning
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
also
such
a
thing
as
making
nothing
out
of
a
molehill
,
in
consequence
of
your
head
being
too
high
to
see
it
.
"
<EOS>
Having
returned
his
brother
-
officer
's
compliments
in
those
terms
,
Sergeant
Cuff
wheeled
about
,
and
walked
away
to
the
window
by
himself
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Franklin
and
I
waited
to
see
what
was
coming
next
.
<EOS>
The
Sergeant
stood
at
the
window
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
,
looking
out
,
and
whistling
the
tune
of
"
The
Last
Rose
of
Summer
"
softly
to
himself
.
<EOS>
Later
in
the
proceedings
,
I
discovered
that
he
only
forgot
his
manners
so
far
as
to
whistle
,
when
his
mind
was
hard
at
work
,
seeing
its
way
inch
by
inch
to
its
own
private
ends
,
on
which
occasions
"
The
Last
Rose
of
Summer
"
evidently
helped
and
encouraged
him
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
it
fitted
in
somehow
with
his
character
.
<EOS>
It
reminded
him
,
you
see
,
of
his
favourite
roses
,
and
,
as
HE
whistled
it
,
it
was
the
most
melancholy
tune
going
.
  
<EOS>
Turning
from
the
window
,
after
a
minute
or
two
,
the
Sergeant
walked
into
the
middle
of
the
room
,
and
stopped
there
,
deep
in
thought
,
with
his
eyes
on
Miss
Rachel
's
bed
-
room
door
.
<EOS>
After
a
little
he
roused
himself
,
nodded
his
head
,
as
much
as
to
say
,
"
That
will
do
,
"
and
,
addressing
me
,
<EOS>
asked
for
ten
minutes
'
conversation
with
my
mistress
,
at
her
ladyship
's
earliest
convenience
.
  
<EOS>
Leaving
the
room
with
this
message
,
I
heard
Mr.
Franklin
ask
the
Sergeant
a
question
,
and
stopped
to
hear
the
answer
also
at
the
threshold
of
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
Can
you
guess
yet
,
"
inquired
Mr.
Franklin
,
"
who
has
stolen
the
Diamond
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
NOBODY
HAS
STOLEN
THE
DIAMOND
,
"
answered
Sergeant
Cuff
.
  
<EOS>
We
both
started
at
that
extraordinary
view
of
the
case
,
and
both
earnestly
begged
him
to
tell
us
what
he
meant
.
  
<EOS>
"
Wait
a
little
,
"
said
the
Sergeant
.
<EOS>
"
The
pieces
of
the
puzzle
are
not
all
put
together
yet
.
<EOS>
"
    
<EOS>
I
found
my
lady
in
her
own
sitting
room
.
<EOS>
She
started
and
looked
annoyed
when
I
mentioned
that
Sergeant
Cuff
wished
to
speak
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
MUST
I
see
him
?
"
<EOS>
she
asked
.
<EOS>
"
Ca
n't
you
represent
me
,
Gabriel
?
"
  
<EOS>
I
felt
at
a
loss
to
understand
this
,
and
showed
it
plainly
,
I
suppose
,
in
my
face
.
<EOS>
My
lady
was
so
good
as
to
explain
herself
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
afraid
my
nerves
are
a
little
shaken
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
There
is
something
in
that
police
-
officer
from
London
which
I
recoil
from
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
why
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
presentiment
that
he
is
bringing
trouble
and
misery
with
him
into
the
house
.
<EOS>
Very
foolish
,
and
very
unlike
ME
 
<EOS>
but
so
it
is
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
hardly
knew
what
to
say
to
this
.
<EOS>
The
more
I
saw
of
Sergeant
Cuff
,
the
better
I
liked
him
.
<EOS>
My
lady
rallied
a
little
after
having
opened
her
heart
to
me
 
being
,
naturally
,
a
woman
of
a
high
courage
,
as
I
have
already
told
you
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
must
see
him
,
I
must
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
ca
n't
prevail
on
myself
to
see
him
alone
.
<EOS>
Bring
him
in
,
Gabriel
,
and
stay
here
as
long
as
he
stays
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
was
the
first
attack
of
the
megrims
that
I
remembered
in
my
mistress
since
the
time
when
she
was
a
young
girl
.
<EOS>
I
went
back
to
the
"
boudoir
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Franklin
strolled
out
into
the
garden
,
and
joined
Mr.
Godfrey
,
whose
time
for
departure
was
now
drawing
near
.
<EOS>
Sergeant
Cuff
<EOS>
and
I
went
straight
to
my
mistress
's
room
.
  
<EOS>
I
declare
my
lady
turned
a
shade
paler
at
the
sight
of
him
!
<EOS>
She
commanded
herself
,
however
,
in
other
respects
,
and
asked
the
Sergeant
if
he
had
any
objection
to
my
being
present
.
<EOS>
She
was
so
good
as
to
add
,
that
I
was
her
trusted
adviser
,
as
well
as
her
old
servant
,
and
that
in
anything
which
related
to
the
household
I
was
the
person
whom
it
might
be
most
profitable
to
consult
.
<EOS>
The
Sergeant
politely
answered
that
he
would
take
my
presence
as
a
favour
,
having
something
to
say
about
the
servants
in
general
,
and
having
found
my
experience
in
that
quarter
already
of
some
use
to
him
.
<EOS>
My
lady
pointed
to
two
chairs
,
and
we
set
in
for
our
conference
immediately
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
already
formed
an
opinion
on
this
case
,
"
says
Sergeant
Cuff
,
"
which
I
beg
your
ladyship
's
permission
to
keep
to
myself
for
the
present
.
<EOS>
My
business
now
is
to
mention
what
I
have
discovered
upstairs
in
Miss
Verinder
's
sitting
-
room
,
and
what
I
have
decided
(
with
your
ladyship
's
leave
)
on
doing
next
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
then
went
into
the
matter
of
the
smear
on
the
paint
,
and
stated
the
conclusions
he
drew
from
it
 
just
as
he
had
stated
them
(
only
with
greater
respect
of
language
)
to
Superintendent
Seegrave
.
<EOS>
"
One
thing
,
"
he
said
,
in
conclusion
,
"
is
certain
.
<EOS>
The
Diamond
is
missing
out
of
the
drawer
in
the
cabinet
.
<EOS>
Another
thing
is
next
to
certain
.
<EOS>
The
marks
from
the
smear
on
the
door
must
be
on
some
article
of
dress
belonging
to
somebody
in
this
house
.
<EOS>
We
must
discover
that
article
of
dress
before
we
go
a
step
further
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
that
discovery
,
"
remarked
my
mistress
,
"
implies
,
I
presume
,
the
discovery
of
the
thief
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
ladyship
's
pardon
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
say
the
Diamond
is
stolen
.
<EOS>
I
only
say
,
at
present
,
that
the
Diamond
is
missing
.
<EOS>
The
discovery
of
the
stained
dress
may
lead
the
way
to
finding
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Her
ladyship
looked
at
me
.
<EOS>
"
Do
you
understand
this
?
<EOS>
"
she
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sergeant
Cuff
understands
it
,
my
lady
,
"
I
answered
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
propose
to
discover
the
stained
dress
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
my
mistress
,
addressing
herself
once
more
to
the
Sergeant
.
<EOS>
"
My
good
servants
,
who
have
been
with
me
for
years
,
have
,
I
am
ashamed
to
say
,
had
their
boxes
and
rooms
searched
already
by
the
other
officer
.
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
and
wo
n't
permit
them
to
be
insulted
in
that
way
a
second
time
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
(
There
was
a
mistress
to
serve
!
<EOS>
There
was
a
woman
in
ten
thousand
,
if
you
like
!
)
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
the
very
point
I
was
about
to
put
to
your
ladyship
,
"
said
the
Sergeant
.
<EOS>
"
The
other
officer
has
done
a
world
of
harm
to
this
inquiry
,
by
letting
the
servants
see
that
he
suspected
them
.
<EOS>
If
I
give
them
cause
to
think
themselves
suspected
a
second
time
,
there
's
no
knowing
what
obstacles
they
may
not
throw
in
my
way
 
the
women
especially
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
,
their
boxes
must
be
searched
again
 
for
this
plain
reason
,
that
the
first
investigation
only
looked
for
the
Diamond
,
and
that
the
second
investigation
must
look
for
the
stained
dress
.
<EOS>
I
quite
agree
with
you
,
my
lady
,
that
the
servants
'
feelings
ought
to
be
consulted
.
<EOS>
But
I
am
equally
clear
that
the
servants
'
wardrobes
ought
to
be
searched
.
"
  
<EOS>
This
looked
very
like
a
dead
-
lock
.
<EOS>
My
lady
said
so
,
in
choicer
language
than
mine
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
got
a
plan
to
meet
the
difficulty
,
"
said
Sergeant
Cuff
,
"
if
your
ladyship
will
consent
to
it
.
<EOS>
I
propose
explaining
the
case
to
the
servants
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
women
will
think
themselves
suspected
directly
,
I
said
,
interrupting
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
women
wo
n't
,
Mr.
Betteredge
,
"
answered
the
Sergeant
,
"
if
I
can
tell
them
I
am
going
to
examine
the
wardrobes
of
EVERYBODY
 
from
her
ladyship
downwards
 
who
slept
in
the
house
on
Wednesday
night
.
<EOS>
It
's
a
mere
formality
,
"
he
added
,
with
a
side
look
at
my
mistress
;
"
but
the
servants
will
accept
it
as
even
dealing
between
them
and
their
betters
;
and
,
instead
of
hindering
the
investigation
,
they
will
make
a
point
of
honour
of
assisting
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
saw
the
truth
of
that
.
<EOS>
My
lady
,
after
her
first
surprise
was
over
,
saw
the
truth
of
it
also
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
certain
the
investigation
is
necessary
?
<EOS>
"
she
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
the
shortest
way
that
I
can
see
,
my
lady
,
to
the
end
we
have
in
view
.
"
  
<EOS>
My
mistress
rose
to
ring
the
bell
for
her
maid
.
<EOS>
"
You
shall
speak
to
the
servants
,
"
she
said
,
"
with
the
keys
of
my
wardrobe
in
your
hand
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Sergeant
Cuff
stopped
her
by
a
very
unexpected
question
.
  
<EOS>
"
Had
n't
we
better
make
sure
first
,
"
he
asked
,
"
that
the
other
ladies
and
gentlemen
in
the
house
will
consent
,
too
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
only
other
lady
in
the
house
is
Miss
Verinder
,
"
answered
my
mistress
,
with
a
look
of
surprise
.
<EOS>
"
The
only
gentlemen
are
my
nephews
,
Mr.
Blake
and
Mr.
Ablewhite
.
<EOS>
There
is
not
the
least
fear
of
a
refusal
from
any
of
the
three
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
reminded
my
lady
here
that
Mr.
Godfrey
was
going
away
.
<EOS>
As
I
said
the
words
,
Mr.
Godfrey
himself
knocked
at
the
door
to
say
good
-
bye
,
and
was
followed
in
by
Mr.
Franklin
,
who
was
going
with
him
to
the
station
.
<EOS>
My
lady
explained
the
difficulty
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Godfrey
settled
it
directly
.
<EOS>
He
called
to
Samuel
,
through
the
window
,
to
take
his
portmanteau
up
-
stairs
again
,
and
he
then
put
the
key
himself
into
Sergeant
Cuff
's
hand
.
<EOS>
"
My
luggage
can
follow
me
to
London
,
"
he
said
,
"
when
the
inquiry
is
over
.
"
<EOS>
The
Sergeant
received
the
key
with
a
becoming
apology
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
to
put
you
to
any
inconvenience
,
sir
,
for
a
mere
formality
;
but
the
example
of
their
betters
will
do
wonders
in
reconciling
the
servants
to
this
inquiry
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Godfrey
,
after
taking
leave
of
my
lady
,
in
a
most
sympathising
manner
,
left
a
farewell
message
for
Miss
Rachel
,
the
terms
of
which
made
it
clear
to
my
mind
that
he
had
not
taken
No
for
an
answer
,
and
that
he
meant
to
put
the
marriage
question
to
her
once
more
,
at
the
next
opportunity
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Franklin
,
on
following
his
cousin
out
,
informed
the
Sergeant
that
all
his
clothes
were
open
to
examination
,
and
that
nothing
he
possessed
was
kept
under
lock
and
key
.
<EOS>
Sergeant
Cuff
made
his
best
acknowledgments
.
<EOS>
His
views
,
you
will
observe
,
had
been
met
with
the
utmost
readiness
by
my
lady
,
by
Mr.
Godfrey
,
and
by
Mr.
Franklin
.
<EOS>
There
was
<EOS>
only
Miss.
Rachel
now
wanting
to
follow
their
lead
,
before
we
called
the
servants
together
,
and
began
the
search
for
the
stained
dress
.
  
<EOS>
My
lady
's
unaccountable
objection
to
the
Sergeant
seemed
to
make
our
conference
more
distasteful
to
her
than
ever
,
as
soon
as
we
were
left
alone
again
.
<EOS>
"
If
I
send
you
down
Miss
Verinder
's
keys
,
"
she
said
to
him
,
"
I
presume
I
shall
have
done
all
you
want
of
me
for
the
present
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
ladyship
's
pardon
,
"
said
Sergeant
Cuff
.
<EOS>
"
Before
we
begin
,
I
should
like
,
if
convenient
,
to
have
the
washing
-
book
.
<EOS>
The
stained
article
of
dress
may
be
an
article
of
linen
.
<EOS>
If
the
search
leads
to
nothing
,
I
want
to
be
able
to
account
next
for
all
the
linen
in
the
house
,
and
for
all
the
linen
sent
to
the
wash
.
<EOS>
If
there
is
an
article
missing
,
there
will
be
at
least
a
presumption
that
it
has
got
the
paint
-
stain
on
it
,
and
that
it
has
been
purposely
made
away
with
,
yesterday
or
to
-
day
,
by
the
person
owning
it
.
<EOS>
Superintendent
Seegrave
,
"
added
the
Sergeant
,
turning
to
me
,
"
pointed
the
attention
of
the
women
-
servants
to
the
smear
,
when
they
all
crowded
into
the
room
on
Thursday
morning
.
<EOS>
That
may
turn
out
,
Mr.
Betteredge
,
to
have
been
one
more
of
Superintendent
Seegrave
's
many
mistakes
.
"
  
<EOS>
My
lady
desired
me
to
ring
the
bell
,
and
order
the
washing
-
book
.
<EOS>
She
remained
with
us
until
it
was
produced
,
in
case
<EOS>
Sergeant
Cuff
had
any
further
request
to
make
of
her
after
looking
at
it
.
  
<EOS>
The
washing
-
book
was
brought
in
by
Rosanna
Spearman
.
<EOS>
The
girl
had
come
down
to
breakfast
that
morning
miserably
pale
and
haggard
,
but
sufficiently
recovered
from
her
illness
of
the
previous
day
to
do
her
usual
work
.
<EOS>
Sergeant
Cuff
looked
attentively
at
our
second
housemaid
 
at
her
face
,
when
she
came
in
;
at
her
crooked
shoulder
,
when
she
went
out
.
  
<EOS>
"
Have
you
anything
more
to
say
to
me
?
"
asked
my
lady
,
still
as
eager
as
ever
to
be
out
of
the
Sergeant
's
society
.
  
<EOS>
The
great
Cuff
opened
the
washing
-
book
,
understood
it
perfectly
in
half
a
minute
,
and
shut
it
up
again
.
<EOS>
"
I
venture
to
trouble
your
ladyship
with
one
last
question
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
Has
the
young
woman
who
brought
us
this
book
been
in
your
employment
as
long
as
the
other
servants
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
do
you
ask
?
"
said
my
lady
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
last
time
I
saw
her
,
"
answered
the
Sergeant
,
"
she
was
in
prison
for
theft
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
After
that
,
there
was
no
help
for
it
,
but
to
tell
him
the
truth
.
<EOS>
My
mistress
dwelt
strongly
on
Rosanna
's
good
conduct
in
her
service
,
and
on
the
high
opinion
entertained
of
her
by
the
matron
at
the
reformatory
.
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
suspect
her
,
I
hope
?
<EOS>
"
my
lady
added
,
in
conclusion
,
very
earnestly
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
already
told
your
ladyship
that
I
do
n't
suspect
any
person
in
the
house
of
thieving
 
up
to
the
present
time
.
"
  
<EOS>
After
that
answer
,
my
lady
rose
to
go
up
-
stairs
,
and
ask
for
Miss
Rachel
's
keys
.
<EOS>
The
Sergeant
was
before
-
hand
with
me
in
opening
the
door
for
her
.
<EOS>
He
made
a
very
low
bow
.
<EOS>
My
lady
shuddered
as
she
passed
him
.
  
<EOS>
We
waited
,
and
waited
,
and
no
keys
appeared
.
<EOS>
Sergeant
Cuff
made
no
remark
to
me
.
<EOS>
He
turned
his
melancholy
face
to
the
window
;
he
put
his
lanky
hands
into
his
pockets
;
and
he
whistled
"
The
Last
Rose
of
Summer
"
softly
to
himself
.
  
<EOS>
At
last
,
Samuel
came
in
,
not
with
the
keys
,
but
with
a
morsel
of
paper
for
me
.
<EOS>
I
got
at
my
spectacles
,
with
some
fumbling
and
difficulty
,
feeling
the
Sergeant
's
dismal
eyes
fixed
on
me
all
the
time
.
<EOS>
There
were
two
or
three
lines
on
the
paper
,
written
in
pencil
by
my
lady
.
<EOS>
They
informed
me
that
Miss
Rachel
flatly
refused
to
have
her
wardrobe
examined
.
<EOS>
Asked
for
her
reasons
,
she
had
burst
out
crying
.
<EOS>
Asked
again
,
she
had
said
:
"
I
wo
n't
,
because
I
wo
n't
.
<EOS>
I
must
yield
to
force
if
you
use
it
,
but
I
will
yield
to
nothing
else
.
<EOS>
"
I
understood
my
lady
's
disinclination
to
face
Sergeant
Cuff
with
such
an
answer
from
her
daughter
as
that
.
<EOS>
If
I
had
not
been
too
old
for
the
amiable
weaknesses
of
youth
,
I
believe
I
should
have
blushed
at
the
notion
of
facing
him
myself
.
  
<EOS>
"
Any
news
of
Miss
Verinder
's
keys
?
"
asked
the
Sergeant
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
young
lady
refuses
to
have
her
wardrobe
examined
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Ah
!
"
said
the
Sergeant
.
  
<EOS>
His
voice
was
not
quite
in
such
a
perfect
state
of
discipline
as
his
face
.
<EOS>
When
he
said
"
Ah
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
it
in
the
tone
of
a
man
who
had
heard
something
which
he
expected
to
hear
.
<EOS>
He
half
angered
and
half
frightened
me
 
<EOS>
why
,
I
could
n't
tell
,
but
he
did
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Must
the
search
be
given
up
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
the
Sergeant
,
"
the
search
must
be
given
up
,
because
your
young
lady
refuses
to
submit
to
it
like
the
rest
.
<EOS>
We
must
examine
all
the
wardrobes
in
the
house
or
none
.
<EOS>
Send
Mr.
Ablewhite
's
portmanteau
to
London
by
the
next
train
,
and
return
the
washing
-
book
,
with
my
compliments
and
thanks
,
to
the
young
woman
who
brought
it
in
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
laid
the
washing
-
book
on
the
table
,
and
taking
out
his
penknife
,
began
to
trim
his
nails
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
seem
to
be
much
disappointed
,
"
I
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Sergeant
Cuff
;
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
much
disappointed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
tried
to
make
him
explain
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
should
Miss
Rachel
put
an
obstacle
in
your
way
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquired
.
<EOS>
"
Is
n't
it
her
interest
to
help
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Wait
a
little
,
Mr.
Betteredge
 
wait
a
little
.
"
  
<EOS>
Cleverer
heads
than
mine
might
have
seen
his
drift
.
<EOS>
Or
a
person
less
fond
of
Miss
Rachel
than
I
was
,
might
have
seen
his
drift
.
<EOS>
My
lady
's
horror
of
him
might
(
as
I
have
since
thought
)
have
meant
that
she
saw
his
drift
(
as
the
scripture
says
)
"
in
a
glass
darkly
.
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
see
it
yet
 
<EOS>
that
's
all
I
know
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
's
to
be
done
next
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
  
<EOS>
Sergeant
Cuff
finished
the
nail
on
which
he
was
then
at
work
,
looked
at
it
for
a
moment
with
a
melancholy
interest
,
and
put
up
his
penknife
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
out
into
the
garden
,
"
he
said
,
"
and
let
's
have
a
look
at
the
roses
.
"
    
<EOS>
The
nearest
way
to
the
garden
,
on
going
out
of
my
lady
's
sitting
-
room
,
was
by
the
shrubbery
path
,
which
you
already
know
of
.
<EOS>
For
the
sake
of
your
better
understanding
of
what
is
now
to
come
,
I
may
add
to
this
,
that
the
shrubbery
path
was
Mr.
Franklin
's
favourite
walk
.
<EOS>
When
he
was
out
in
the
grounds
,
and
when
we
failed
to
find
him
anywhere
else
,
we
generally
found
him
here
.
  
<EOS>
I
am
afraid
I
must
own
that
I
am
rather
an
obstinate
old
man
.
<EOS>
The
more
firmly
Sergeant
Cuff
kept
his
thoughts
shut
up
from
me
,
the
more
firmly
I
persisted
in
trying
to
look
in
at
them
.
<EOS>
As
we
turned
into
the
shrubbery
path
,
I
attempted
to
circumvent
him
in
another
way
.
  
<EOS>
"
As
things
are
now
,
"
I
said
,
"
if
I
was
in
your
place
,
I
should
be
at
my
wits
'
end
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
were
in
my
place
,
"
answered
the
Sergeant
,
"
you
would
have
formed
an
opinion
 
and
,
as
things
are
now
,
any
doubt
you
might
previously
have
felt
about
your
own
conclusions
would
be
completely
set
at
rest
.
<EOS>
Never
mind
for
the
present
what
those
conclusions
are
,
Mr.
Betteredge
.
<EOS>
I
have
n't
brought
you
out
here
to
draw
me
like
a
badger
;
I
have
brought
you
out
here
to
ask
for
some
information
.
<EOS>
You
might
have
given
it
to
me
no
doubt
,
in
the
house
,
instead
of
out
of
it
.
<EOS>
But
doors
and
listeners
have
a
knack
of
getting
together
;
and
,
in
my
line
of
life
,
we
cultivate
a
healthy
taste
for
the
open
air
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Who
was
to
circumvent
THIS
man
?
<EOS>
I
gave
in
 
and
waited
as
patiently
as
I
could
to
hear
what
was
coming
next
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
wo
n't
enter
into
your
young
lady
's
motives
,
"
the
Sergeant
went
on
<EOS>
;
"
we
will
only
say
it
's
a
pity
she
declines
to
assist
me
,
because
,
by
so
doing
,
she
makes
this
investigation
more
difficult
than
it
might
otherwise
have
been
.
<EOS>
We
must
now
try
to
solve
the
mystery
of
the
smear
on
the
door
 
<EOS>
which
,
you
may
take
my
word
for
it
,
means
the
mystery
of
the
Diamond
also
 
in
some
other
way
.
<EOS>
I
have
decided
to
see
the
servants
,
and
to
search
their
thoughts
and
actions
,
Mr.
Betteredge
,
instead
of
searching
their
wardrobes
.
<EOS>
Before
I
begin
,
however
,
I
want
to
ask
you
a
question
or
two
.
<EOS>
You
are
an
observant
man
 
<EOS>
did
you
notice
anything
strange
in
any
of
the
servants
(
making
due
allowance
,
of
course
,
for
fright
and
fluster
)
,
after
the
loss
of
the
Diamond
was
found
out
?
<EOS>
Any
particular
quarrel
among
them
?
<EOS>
Any
one
of
them
not
in
his
or
her
usual
spirits
?
<EOS>
Unexpectedly
out
of
temper
,
for
instance
?
<EOS>
or
unexpectedly
taken
ill
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
had
just
time
to
think
of
Rosanna
Spearman
's
sudden
illness
at
yesterday
's
dinner
 
but
not
time
to
make
any
answer
 
when
I
saw
Sergeant
Cuff
's
eyes
suddenly
turn
aside
towards
the
shrubbery
;
and
I
heard
him
say
softly
to
himself
,
"
Hullo
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
matter
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
touch
of
the
rheumatics
in
my
back
,
"
said
the
Sergeant
,
in
a
loud
voice
,
as
if
he
wanted
some
third
person
to
hear
us
.
<EOS>
"
We
shall
have
a
change
in
the
weather
before
long
.
"
  
<EOS>
A
few
steps
further
brought
us
to
the
corner
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
Turning
off
sharp
to
the
right
,
we
entered
on
the
terrace
,
and
went
down
,
by
the
steps
in
the
middle
,
into
the
garden
below
.
<EOS>
Sergeant
Cuff
stopped
there
,
in
the
open
space
,
where
we
could
see
round
us
on
every
side
.
  
<EOS>
"
About
that
young
person
,
Rosanna
Spearman
?
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
n't
very
likely
,
with
her
personal
appearance
,
that
she
has
got
a
lover
.
<EOS>
But
,
for
the
girl
's
own
sake
,
I
must
ask
you
at
once
whether
SHE
has
provided
herself
with
a
sweetheart
,
poor
wretch
,
like
the
rest
of
them
?
"
  
<EOS>
What
on
earth
did
he
mean
,
under
present
circumstances
,
by
putting
such
a
question
to
me
as
that
?
<EOS>
I
stared
at
him
,
instead
of
answering
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
saw
Rosanna
Spearman
hiding
in
the
shrubbery
as
we
went
by
,
"
said
the
Sergeant
.
  
<EOS>
"
When
you
said
"
Hullo
"
?
"
  
"
Yes
 
when
I
said
"
Hullo
!
"
<EOS>
If
there
's
a
sweetheart
in
the
case
,
the
hiding
does
n't
much
matter
.
<EOS>
If
there
is
n't
 
as
things
are
in
this
house
 
<EOS>
the
hiding
is
a
highly
suspicious
circumstance
,
and
it
will
be
my
painful
duty
to
act
on
it
accordingly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
What
,
in
God
's
name
,
was
I
to
say
to
him
?
<EOS>
I
knew
the
shrubbery
was
Mr.
Franklin
's
favourite
walk
;
I
knew
he
would
most
likely
turn
that
way
when
he
came
back
from
the
station
;
I
knew
that
Penelope
had
over
and
over
again
caught
her
fellow
-
servant
hanging
about
there
,
and
had
always
declared
to
me
that
Rosanna
's
object
was
to
attract
Mr.
Franklin
's
attention
.
<EOS>
If
my
daughter
was
right
,
she
might
well
have
been
lying
in
wait
for
Mr.
Franklin
's
return
when
the
Sergeant
noticed
her
.
<EOS>
I
was
put
between
the
two
difficulties
of
mentioning
Penelope
's
fanciful
notion
as
if
it
was
mine
,
or
of
leaving
an
unfortunate
creature
to
suffer
the
consequences
,
the
very
serious
consequences
,
of
exciting
the
suspicion
of
Sergeant
Cuff
.
<EOS>
Out
of
pure
pity
for
the
girl
 
on
my
soul
and
my
character
,
out
of
pure
pity
for
the
girl
 
<EOS>
I
gave
the
Sergeant
the
necessary
explanations
,
and
told
him
that
Rosanna
had
been
mad
enough
to
set
her
heart
on
Mr.
Franklin
Blake
.
  
<EOS>
Sergeant
Cuff
never
laughed
.
<EOS>
On
the
few
occasions
when
anything
amused
him
,
he
curled
up
a
little
at
the
corners
of
the
lips
,
nothing
more
.
<EOS>
He
curled
up
now
.
  
<EOS>
"
Had
n't
you
better
say
she
's
mad
enough
to
be
an
ugly
girl
and
only
a
servant
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
.
<EOS>
"
The
falling
in
love
with
a
gentleman
of
Mr.
Franklin
Blake
's
manners
and
appearance
does
n't
seem
to
me
to
be
the
maddest
part
of
her
conduct
by
any
means
.
<EOS>
However
,
I
'm
glad
the
thing
is
cleared
up
:
it
relieves
one
's
mind
to
have
things
cleared
up
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
I
'll
keep
it
a
secret
,
Mr.
Betteredge
.
<EOS>
I
like
to
be
tender
to
human
infirmity
 
though
I
do
n't
get
many
chances
of
exercising
that
virtue
in
my
line
of
life
.
<EOS>
You
think
Mr.
Franklin
Blake
has
n't
got
a
suspicion
of
the
girl
's
fancy
for
him
?
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
he
would
have
found
it
out
fast
enough
if
she
had
been
nice
-
looking
.
<EOS>
The
ugly
women
have
a
bad
time
of
it
in
this
world
;
let
's
hope
it
will
be
made
up
to
them
in
another
.
<EOS>
You
have
got
a
nice
garden
here
,
and
a
well
-
kept
lawn
.
<EOS>
See
for
yourself
how
much
better
the
flowers
look
with
grass
about
them
instead
of
gravel
.
<EOS>
No
,
thank
you
.
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
take
a
rose
.
<EOS>
It
goes
to
my
heart
to
break
them
off
the
stem
.
<EOS>
Just
as
it
goes
to
your
heart
,
you
know
,
when
there
's
something
wrong
in
the
servants
'
hall
.
<EOS>
Did
you
notice
anything
you
could
n't
account
for
in
any
of
the
servants
when
the
loss
of
the
Diamond
was
first
found
out
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
had
got
on
very
fairly
well
with
Sergeant
Cuff
so
far
.
<EOS>
But
the
slyness
with
which
he
slipped
in
that
last
question
put
me
on
my
guard
.
<EOS>
In
plain
English
,
I
did
n't
at
all
relish
the
notion
of
helping
his
inquiries
,
when
those
inquiries
took
him
(
in
the
capacity
of
snake
in
the
grass
)
among
my
fellow
-
servants
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
noticed
nothing
,
"
I
said
,
"
except
that
we
all
lost
our
heads
together
,
myself
included
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
"
says
the
Sergeant
,
"
that
's
all
you
have
to
tell
me
,
is
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
I
answered
,
with
(
as
I
flattered
myself
)
an
unmoved
countenance
,
"
That
is
all
.
"
  
<EOS>
Sergeant
Cuff
's
dismal
eyes
looked
me
hard
in
the
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Betteredge
,
"
he
said
,
"
have
you
any
objection
to
oblige
me
by
shaking
hands
?
<EOS>
I
have
taken
an
extraordinary
liking
to
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
(
Why
he
should
have
chosen
the
exact
moment
when
I
was
deceiving
him
to
give
me
that
proof
of
his
good
opinion
,
is
beyond
all
comprehension
!
<EOS>
I
felt
a
little
proud
 
<EOS>
I
really
did
feel
a
little
proud
of
having
been
one
too
many
at
last
for
the
celebrated
Cuff
!
)
  
<EOS>
We
went
back
to
the
house
;
the
Sergeant
requesting
that
I
would
give
him
a
room
to
himself
,
and
then
send
in
the
servants
(
the
indoor
servants
only
)
,
one
after
another
,
in
the
order
of
their
rank
,
from
first
to
last

<EOS>
I
showed
Sergeant
Cuff
into
my
own
room
,
and
then
called
the
servants
together
in
the
hall
.
<EOS>
Rosanna
Spearman
appeared
among
them
,
much
as
usual
.
<EOS>
She
was
as
quick
in
her
way
as
the
Sergeant
in
his
,
and
I
suspect
she
had
heard
what
he
said
to
me
about
the
servants
in
general
,
just
before
he
discovered
her
.
<EOS>
There
she
was
,
at
any
rate
,
looking
as
if
she
had
never
heard
of
such
a
place
as
the
shrubbery
in
her
life
.
  
<EOS>
I
sent
them
in
,
one
by
one
,
as
desired
.
<EOS>
The
cook
was
the
first
to
enter
the
Court
of
Justice

my

She
remained

a
short
time

,
on
coming
out
:
"
Sergeant
Cuff
has
a
heart
;
HE
does
n't
cut
jokes
,
Mr.
Betteredge
,
with
a
poor
hard
-
working
girl
.
"
  
<EOS>
Going
into
the
Court
of
Justice
,
when
it
was
all
over
,
to
hear
if
there
were
any
further
commands
for
me
,
I
found
the
Sergeant
at
his
old
trick
 
looking
out
of
window
,
and
whistling
"
The
Last
Rose
of
Summer
"
to
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
Any
discoveries
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquired
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
Rosanna
Spearman
asks
leave
to
go
out
,
"
said
the
Sergeant
,
"
let
the
poor
thing
go
;
but
let
me
know
first
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
might
as
well
have
held
my
tongue
about
Rosanna
and
Mr.
Franklin
!
<EOS>
It
was
plain
enough
;
the
unfortunate
girl
had
fallen
under
Sergeant
Cuff
's
suspicions
,
in
spite
of
all
I
could
do
to
prevent
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
do
n't
think
Rosanna
is
concerned
in
the
loss
of
the
Diamond
?
<EOS>
"
I
ventured
to
say
.
  
<EOS>
The
corners
of
the
Sergeant
's
melancholy
mouth
curled
up
,
and
he
looked
hard
in
my
face
,
just
as
he
had
looked
in
the
garden
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
had
better
not
tell
you
,
Mr.
Betteredge
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
You
might
lose
your
head
,
you
know
,
for
the
second
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
began
to
doubt
whether
I
had
been
one
too
many
for
the
celebrated
Cuff
,
after
all
!
<EOS>
It
was
rather
a
relief
to
me
that
we
were
interrupted
here
by
a
knock
at
the
door
,
and
a
message
from
the
cook
.
<EOS>
Rosanna
Spearman
HAD
asked
to
go
out
,
for
the
usual
reason
,
that
her
head
was
bad
,
and
she
wanted
a
breath
of
fresh
air
.
<EOS>
At
a
sign
from
the
Sergeant
,
I
said
,
Yes
.
"
<EOS>
Which
is
the
servants
'
way
out
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
,
when
the
messenger
had
gone
.
<EOS>
I
showed
him
the
servants
'
way
out
.
<EOS>
"
Lock
the
door
of
your
room
,
"
says
the
Sergeant
;
"
and
if
anybody
asks
for
me
,
say
I
'm
in
there
,
composing
my
mind
.
"
<EOS>
He
curled
up
again
at
the
corners
of
the
lips
,
and
disappeared
.
  
<EOS>
Left
alone
,
under
those
circumstances
,
a
devouring
curiosity
pushed
me
on
to
make
some
discoveries
for
myself
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
plain
that
Sergeant
Cuff
's
suspicions
of
Rosanna
had
been
roused
by
something
that
he
had
found
out
at
his
examination
of
the
servants
in
my
room
.
<EOS>
Now
,
the
only
two
servants
(
excepting
Rosanna
herself
)
who
had
remained
under
examination
for
any
length
of
time
,
were
my
lady
's
own
maid
and
the
first
housemaid
,
those
two
being
also
the
women
who
had
taken
the
lead
in
persecuting
their
unfortunate
fellow
-
servant
from
the
first
.
<EOS>
Reaching
these
conclusions
,
I
looked
in
on
them
,
casually
as
it
might
be
,
in
the
servants
'
hall
,
and
,
finding
tea
going
forward
,
instantly
invited
myself
to
that
meal
.
<EOS>
(
For
,
NOTA
BENE
,
a
drop
of
tea
is
to
a
woman
's
tongue
what
a
drop
of
oil
is
to
a
wasting
lamp
.
)
  
<EOS>
My
reliance
on
the
tea
-
pot
,
as
an
ally
,
did
not
go
unrewarded
.
<EOS>
In
less
than
half
an
hour
I
knew
as
much
as
the
Sergeant
himself
.
  
<EOS>
My
lady
's
maid
and
the
housemaid
,
had
,
it
appeared
,
neither
of
them
believed
in
Rosanna
's
illness
of
the
previous
day
.
<EOS>
These
two
devils
 
<EOS>
I
ask
your
pardon
;
but
how
else
CAN
you
describe
a
couple
of
spiteful
women
?
 
<EOS>
had
stolen
up
-
stairs
,
at
intervals
during
the
Thursday
afternoon
;
had
tried
Rosanna
's
door
,
and
found
it
locked
;
had
knocked
,
and
not
been
answered
;
had
listened
,
and
not
heard
a
sound
inside
.
<EOS>
When
the
girl
had
come
down
to
tea
,
and
had
been
sent
up
,
still
out
of
sorts
,
to
bed
again
,
the
two
devils
aforesaid
had
tried
her
door
once
more
,
and
found
it
locked
;
had
looked
at
the
keyhole
,
and
found
it
stopped
up
;
had
seen
a
light
under
the
door
at
midnight
,
and
had
heard
the
crackling
of
a
fire
(
a
fire
in
a
servant
's
bed
-
room
in
the
month
of
June
!
)
<EOS>
at
four
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
All
this
they
had
told
Sergeant
Cuff
,
who
,
in
return
for
their
anxiety
to
enlighten
him
,
had
eyed
them
with
sour
and
suspicious
looks
,
and
had
shown
them
plainly
that
he
did
n't
believe
either
one
or
the
other
.
<EOS>
Hence
,
the
unfavourable
reports
of
him
which
these
two
women
had
brought
out
with
them
from
the
examination
.
<EOS>
Hence
,
also
(
without
reckoning
the
influence
of
the
tea
-
pot
)
,
their
readiness
to
let
their
tongues
run
to
any
length
on
the
subject
of
the
Sergeant
's
ungracious
behaviour
to
them
.
  
<EOS>
Having
had
some
experience
of
the
great
Cuff
's
round
-
about
ways
,
and
having
last
seen
him
evidently
bent
on
following
Rosanna
privately
when
she
went
out
for
her
walk
,
it
seemed
clear
to
me
that
he
had
thought
it
unadvisable
to
let
the
lady
's
maid
and
the
housemaid
know
how
materially
they
had
helped
him
.
<EOS>
They
were
just
the
sort
of
women
,
if
he
had
treated
their
evidence
as
trustworthy
,
to
have
been
puffed
up
by
it
,
and
to
have
said
or
done
something
which
would
have
put
Rosanna
Spearman
on
her
guard
.
  
<EOS>
I
walked
out
in
the
fine
summer
afternoon
,
very
sorry
for
the
poor
girl
,
and
very
uneasy
in
my
mind
at
the
turn
things
had
taken
.
<EOS>
Drifting
towards
the
shrubbery
,
some
time
later
,
there
I
met
Mr.
Franklin
.
<EOS>
After
returning
from
seeing
his
cousin
off
at
the
station
,
he
had
been
with
my
lady
,
holding
a
long
conversation
with
her
.
<EOS>
She
had
told
him
of
Miss
Rachel
's
unaccountable
refusal
to
let
her
wardrobe
be
examined
;
and
had
put
him
in
such
low
spirits
about
my
young
lady
that
he
seemed
to
shrink
from
speaking
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
The
family
temper
appeared
in
his
face
that
evening
,
for
the
first
time
in
my
experience
of
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Betteredge
,
"
he
said
,
"
how
does
the
atmosphere
of
mystery
and
suspicion
in
which
we
are
all
living
now
,
agree
with
you
?
<EOS>
Do
you
remember
that
morning
when
I
first
came
here
with
the
Moonstone
?
<EOS>
I
wish
to
God
we
had
thrown
it
into
the
quicksand
!
"
  
<EOS>
After
breaking
out
in
that
way
,
he
abstained
from
speaking
again
until
he
had
composed
himself
.
<EOS>
We
walked
silently
,
side
by
side
,
for
a
minute
or
two
,
and
then
he
asked
me
what
had
become
of
Sergeant
Cuff
.
<EOS>
It
was
impossible
to
put
Mr.
Franklin
off
with
the
excuse
of
the
Sergeant
being
in
my
room
,
composing
his
mind
.
<EOS>
I
told
him
exactly
what
had
happened
,
mentioning
particularly
what
my
lady
's
maid
and
the
house
-
maid
had
said
about
Rosanna
Spearman
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Franklin
's
clear
head
saw
the
turn
the
Sergeant
's
suspicions
had
taken
,
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
.
  
<EOS>
"
Did
n't
you
tell
me
this
morning
,
"
he
said
,
"
that
one
of
the
tradespeople
declared
he
had
met
Rosanna
yesterday
,
on
the
footway
to
Frizinghall
,
when
we
supposed
her
to
be
ill
in
her
room
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
sir
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
my
aunt
's
maid
and
the
other
woman
have
spoken
the
truth
,
you
may
depend
upon
it
the
tradesman
did
meet
her
.
<EOS>
The
girl
's
attack
of
illness
was
a
blind
to
deceive
us
.
<EOS>
She
had
some
guilty
reason
for
going
to
the
town
secretly
.
<EOS>
The
paint
-
stained
dress
is
a
dress
of
hers
;
and
the
fire
heard
crackling
in
her
room
at
four
in
the
morning
was
a
fire
lit
to
destroy
it
.
<EOS>
Rosanna
Spearman
has
stolen
the
Diamond
.
<EOS>
I
'll
go
in
directly
,
and
tell
my
aunt
the
turn
things
have
taken
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
just
yet
,
if
you
please
,
sir
,
"
said
a
melancholy
voice
behind
us
.
  
<EOS>
We
both
turned
about
,
and
found
ourselves
face
to
face
with
Sergeant
Cuff
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
not
just
yet
?
"
asked
Mr.
Franklin
.
  
<EOS>
"
Because
,
sir
,
if
you
tell
her
ladyship
,
her
ladyship
will
tell
Miss
Verinder
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Suppose
she
does
.
<EOS>
What
then
?
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Franklin
said
those
words
with
a
sudden
heat
and
vehemence
,
as
if
the
Sergeant
had
mortally
offended
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
think
it
's
wise
,
sir
,
"
said
Sergeant
Cuff
,
quietly
,
"
to
put
such
a
question
as
that
to
me
 
at
such
a
time
as
this
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
moment
's
silence
between
them
:
Mr.
Franklin
walked
close
up
to
the
Sergeant
.
<EOS>
The
two
looked
each
other
straight
in
the
face
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Franklin
spoke
first
,
dropping
his
voice
as
suddenly
as
he
had
raised
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
you
know
,
Mr.
Cuff
,
"
he
said
,
"
that
you
are
treading
on
delicate
ground
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
n't
the
first
time
,
by
a
good
many
hundreds
,
that
I
find
myself
treading
on
delicate
ground
,
"
answered
the
other
,
as
immovable
as
ever
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
to
understand
that
you
forbid
me
to
tell
my
aunt
what
has
happened
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
to
understand
,
if
you
please
,
sir
,
that
I
throw
up
the
case
,
if
you
tell
Lady
Verinder
,
or
tell
anybody
,
what
has
happened
,
until
I
give
you
leave
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
That
settled
it
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Franklin
had
no
choice
but
to
submit
.
<EOS>
He
turned
away
in
anger
 
and
left
us
.
  
<EOS>
I
had
stood
there
listening
to
them
,
all
in
a
tremble
;
not
knowing
whom
to
suspect
,
or
what
to
think
next
.
<EOS>
In
the
midst
of
my
confusion
,
two
things
,
however
,
were
plain
to
me
.
<EOS>
First
,
that
my
young
lady
was
,
in
some
unaccountable
manner
,
at
the
bottom
of
the
sharp
speeches
that
had
passed
between
them
.
<EOS>
Second
,
that
they
thoroughly
understood
each
other
,
without
having
previously
exchanged
a
word
of
explanation
on
either
side
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Betteredge
,
"
says
the
Sergeant
,
"
you
have
done
a
very
foolish
thing
in
my
absence
.
<EOS>
You
have
done
a
little
detective
business
on
your
own
account
.
<EOS>
For
the
future
,
perhaps
you
will
be
so
obliging
as
to
do
your
detective
business
along
with
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
took
me
by
the
arm
,
and
walked
me
away
with
him
along
the
road
by
which
he
had
come
.
<EOS>
I
dare
say
I
had
deserved
his
reproof
 
<EOS>
but
I
was
not
going
to
help
him
to
set
traps
for
Rosanna
Spearman
,
for
all
that
.
<EOS>
Thief
or
no
thief
,
legal
or
not
legal
,
I
do
n't
care
 
<EOS>
I
pitied
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
want
of
me
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
,
shaking
him
off
,
and
stopping
short
.
  
<EOS>
"
Only
a
little
information
about
the
country
round
here
,
"
said
the
Sergeant
.
  
<EOS>
I
could
n't
well
object
to
improve
Sergeant
Cuff
in
his
geography
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
there
any
path
,
in
that
direction
,
leading
to
the
sea
-
beach
from
this
house
?
"
asked
the
Sergeant
.
<EOS>
He
pointed
,
as
he
spoke
,
to
the
fir
-
plantation
which
led
to
the
Shivering
Sand
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
I
said
,
"
there
is
a
path
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Show
it
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Side
by
side
,
in
the
grey
of
the
summer
evening
,
Sergeant
Cuff
and
I
set
forth
for
the
Shivering
Sand
.
    
<EOS>
The
Sergeant
remained
silent
,
thinking
his
own
thoughts
,
till
we
entered
the
plantation
of
firs
which
led
to
the
quicksand
.
<EOS>
There
he
roused
himself
,
like
a
man
whose
mind
was
made
up
,
and
spoke
to
me
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Betteredge
,
"
he
said
,
"
as
you
have
honoured
me
by
taking
an
oar
in
my
boat
,
and
as
you
may
,
I
think
,
be
of
some
assistance
to
me
before
the
evening
is
out
,
I
see
no
use
in
our
mystifying
one
another
any
longer
,
and
I
propose
to
set
you
an
example
of
plain
speaking
on
my
side
.
<EOS>
You
are
determined
to
give
me
no
information
to
the
prejudice
of
Rosanna
Spearman
,
because
she
has
been
a
good
girl
to
YOU
,
and
because
you
pity
her
heartily
.
<EOS>
Those
humane
considerations
do
you
a
world
of
credit
,
but
they
happen
in
this
instance
to
be
humane
considerations
<EOS>
clean
thrown
away
.
<EOS>
Rosanna
Spearman
is
not
in
the
slightest
danger
of
getting
into
trouble
 
<EOS>
no
,
not
if
I
fix
her
with
being
concerned
in
the
disappearance
of
the
Diamond
,
on
evidence
which
is
as
plain
as
the
nose
on
your
face
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
mean
that
my
lady
wo
n't
prosecute
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
mean
that
your
lady
CAN'T
prosecute
,
"
said
the
Sergeant
.
"
<EOS>
Rosanna
Spearman
is
simply
an
instrument
in
the
hands
of
another
person
,
and
Rosanna
Spearman
will
be
held
harmless
for
that
other
person
's
sake
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
spoke
like
a
man
in
earnest
 
<EOS>
there
was
no
denying
that
.
<EOS>
Still
,
I
felt
something
stirring
uneasily
against
him
in
my
mind
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ca
n't
you
give
that
other
person
a
name
?
<EOS>
"
I
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ca
n't
you
,
Mr.
Betteredge
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
.
"
  
<EOS>
Sergeant
Cuff
stood
stock
still
,
and
surveyed
me
with
a
look
of
melancholy
interest
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
always
a
pleasure
to
me
to
be
tender
towards
human
infirmity
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
feel
particularly
tender
at
the
present
moment
,
Mr.
Betteredge
,
towards
you
.
<EOS>
And
you
,
with
the
same
excellent
motive
,
feel
particularly
tender
towards
Rosanna
Spearman
,
do
n't
you
?
<EOS>
Do
you
happen
to
know
whether
she
has
had
a
new
outfit
of
linen
lately
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
What
he
meant
by
slipping
in
this
extraordinary
question
unawares
,
I
was
at
a
total
loss
to
imagine
.
<EOS>
Seeing
no
possible
injury
to
Rosanna
if
I
owned
the
truth
,
I
answered
that
the
girl
had
come
to
us
rather
sparely
provided
with
linen
,
and
that
my
lady
,
in
recompense
for
her
good
conduct
(
I
laid
a
stress
on
her
good
conduct
)
,
had
given
her
a
new
outfit
not
a
fortnight
since
.
  
<EOS>
"
This
is
a
miserable
world
,
"
says
the
Sergeant
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Human
life
,
Mr.
Betteredge
,
is
a
sort
of
target
 
misfortune
is
always
firing
at
it
,
and
always
hitting
the
mark
.
<EOS>
But
for
that
outfit
,
we
should
have
discovered
a
new
nightgown
or
petticoat
among
Rosanna
's
things
,
and
have
nailed
her
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
You
're
not
at
a
loss
to
follow
me
,
are
you
?
<EOS>
You
have
examined
the
servants
yourself
,
and
you
know
what
discoveries
two
of
them
made
outside
Rosanna
's
door
.
<EOS>
Surely
you
know
what
the
girl
was
about
yesterday
,
after
she
was
taken
ill
?
<EOS>
You
ca
n't
guess
?
<EOS>
Oh
dear
me
,
it
's
as
plain
as
that
strip
of
light
there
,
at
the
end
of
the
trees
.
<EOS>
At
eleven
,
on
Thursday
morning
,
Superintendent
Seegrave
(
who
is
a
mass
of
human
infirmity
)
points
out
to
all
the
women
servants
the
smear
on
the
door
.
<EOS>
Rosanna
has
her
own
reasons
for
suspecting
her
own
things
;
she
takes
the
first
opportunity
of
getting
to
her
room
,
finds
the
paint
-
stain
on
her
night
-
gown
,
or
petticoat
,
or
what
not
,
shams
ill
and
slips
away
to
the
town
,
gets
the
materials
for
making
a
new
petticoat
or
nightgown
,
makes
it
alone
in
her
room
on
the
Thursday
night
lights
a
fire
(
not
to
destroy
it
;
two
of
her
fellow
-
servants
are
prying
outside
her
door
,
and
she
knows
better
than
to
make
a
smell
of
burning
,
and
to
have
a
lot
of
tinder
to
get
rid
of
)
 
lights
a
fire
,
I
say
,
to
dry
and
iron
the
substitute
dress
after
wringing
it
out
,
keeps
the
stained
dress
hidden
(
probably
ON
her
)
,
and
is
at
this
moment
occupied
in
making
away
with
it
,
in
some
convenient
place
,
on
that
lonely
bit
of
beach
ahead
of
us
.
<EOS>
I
have
traced
her
this
evening
to
your
fishing
village
,
and
to
one
particular
cottage
,
which
we
may
possibly
have
to
visit
,
before
we
go
back
.
<EOS>
She
stopped
in
the
cottage
for
some
time
,
and
she
came
out
with
(
as
I
believe
)
something
hidden
under
her
cloak
.
<EOS>
A
cloak
(
on
a
woman
's
back
)
is
an
emblem
of
charity
 
it
covers
a
multitude
of
sins
.
<EOS>
I
saw
her
set
off
northwards
along
the
coast
,
after
leaving
the
cottage
.
<EOS>
Is
your
sea
-
shore
here
considered
a
fine
specimen
of
marine
landscape
,
Mr.
Betteredge
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
answered
,
"
Yes
,
"
as
shortly
as
might
be
.
  
<EOS>
"
Tastes
differ
,
"
says
Sergeant
Cuff
.
<EOS>
"
Looking
at
it
from
my
point
of
view
,
I
never
saw
a
marine
landscape
that
I
admired
less
.
<EOS>
If
you
happen
to
be
following
another
person
along
your
sea
-
coast
,
and
if
that
person
happens
to
look
round
,
there
is
n't
a
scrap
of
cover
to
hide
you
anywhere
.
<EOS>
I
had
to
choose
between
taking
Rosanna
in
custody
on
suspicion
,
or
leaving
her
,
for
the
time
being
,
with
her
little
game
in
her
own
hands
.
<EOS>
For
reasons
which
I
wo
n't
trouble
you
with
,
I
decided
on
making
any
sacrifice
rather
than
give
the
alarm
as
soon
as
to
-
night
to
a
certain
person
who
shall
be
nameless
between
us
.
<EOS>
I
came
back
to
the
house
to
ask
you
to
take
me
to
the
north
end
of
the
beach
by
another
way
.
<EOS>
Sand
 
in
respect
of
its
printing
off
people
's
footsteps
 
<EOS>
is
one
of
the
best
detective
officers
I
know
.
<EOS>
If
we
do
n't
meet
with
Rosanna
Spearman
by
coming
round
on
her
in
this
way
,
the
sand
may
tell
us
what
she
has
been
at
,
if
the
light
only
lasts
long
enough
.
<EOS>
Here
IS
the
sand
.
<EOS>
If
you
will
excuse
my
suggesting
it
 
suppose
you
hold
your
tongue
,
and
let
me
go
first
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
If
there
is
such
a
thing
known
at
the
doctor
's
shop
as
a
DETECTIVE
-
FEVER
,
that
disease
had
now
got
fast
hold
of
your
humble
servant
.
<EOS>
Sergeant
Cuff
went
on
between
the
hillocks
of
sand
,
down
to
the
beach
.
<EOS>
I
followed
him
(
with
my
heart
in
my
mouth
)
;
and
waited
at
a
little
distance
for
what
was
to
happen
next
.
  
<EOS>
As
it
turned
out
,
I
found
myself
standing
nearly
in
the
same
place
where
Rosanna
Spearman
and
I
had
been
talking
together
when
Mr.
Franklin
suddenly
appeared
before
us
,
on
arriving
at
our
house
from
London
.
<EOS>
While
my
eyes
were
watching
the
Sergeant
,
my
mind
wandered
away
in
spite
of
me
to
what
had
passed
,
on
that
former
occasion
,
between
Rosanna
and
me
.
<EOS>
I
declare
I
almost
felt
the
poor
thing
slip
her
hand
again
into
mine
,
and
give
it
a
little
grateful
squeeze
to
thank
me
for
speaking
kindly
to
her
.
<EOS>
I
declare
I
almost
heard
her
voice
telling
me
again
that
the
Shivering
Sand
seemed
to
draw
her
to
it
against
her
own
will
<EOS>
,
whenever
she
went
out
 
almost
saw
her
face
brighten
again
,
as
it
brightened
when
she
first
set
eyes
upon
Mr.
Franklin
coming
briskly
out
on
us
from
among
the
hillocks
.
<EOS>
My
spirits
fell
lower
and
lower
as
I
thought
of
these
things
 
and
the
view
of
the
lonesome
little
bay
,
when
I
looked
about
to
rouse
myself
,
only
served
to
make
me
feel
more
uneasy
still
.
  
<EOS>
The
last
of
the
evening
light
was
fading
away
;
and
over
all
the
desolate
place
there
hung
a
still
and
awful
calm
.
<EOS>
The
heave
of
the
main
ocean
on
the
great
sandbank
out
in
the
bay
,
was
a
heave
that
made
no
sound
.
<EOS>
The
inner
sea
lay
lost
and
dim
,
without
a
breath
of
wind
to
stir
it
.
<EOS>
Patches
of
nasty
ooze
floated
,
yellow
-
white
,
on
the
dead
surface
of
the
water
.
<EOS>
Scum
and
slime
shone
faintly
in
certain
places
,
where
the
last
of
the
light
still
caught
them
on
the
two
great
spits
of
rock
jutting
out
,
north
and
south
,
into
the
sea
.
<EOS>
It
was
now
the
time
of
the
turn
of
the
tide
:
and
even
as
I
stood
there
waiting
,
the
broad
brown
face
of
the
quicksand
began
to
dimple
and
quiver
 
the
only
moving
thing
in
all
the
horrid
place
.
  
<EOS>
I
saw
the
Sergeant
start
as
the
shiver
of
the
sand
caught
his
eye
.
<EOS>
After
looking
at
it
for
a
minute
or
so
,
he
turned
and
came
back
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
treacherous
place
,
Mr.
Betteredge
,
"
he
said
;
"
and
no
signs
of
Rosanna
Spearman
anywhere
on
the
beach
,
look
where
you
may
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
took
me
down
lower
on
the
shore
,
and
I
saw
for
myself
that
his
footsteps
and
mine
were
the
only
footsteps
printed
off
on
the
sand
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
does
the
fishing
village
bear
,
standing
where
we
are
now
?
"
asked
Sergeant
Cuff
.
  
<EOS>
"
Cobb
's
Hole
,
"
I
answered
(
that
being
the
name
of
the
place
)
,
"
bears
as
near
as
may
be
,
due
south
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
saw
the
girl
this
evening
,
walking
northward
along
the
shore
,
from
Cobb
's
Hole
,
"
said
the
Sergeant
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Consequently
,
she
must
have
been
walking
towards
this
place
.
<EOS>
Is
Cobb
's
Hole
on
the
other
side
of
that
point
of
land
there
?
<EOS>
And
can
we
get
to
it
 
<EOS>
now
it
's
low
water
 
by
the
beach
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
answered
,
"
Yes
,
"
to
both
those
questions
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
'll
excuse
my
suggesting
it
,
we
'll
step
out
briskly
,
"
said
the
Sergeant
.
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
find
the
place
where
she
left
the
shore
,
before
it
gets
dark
.
"
  
<EOS>
We
had
walked
,
I
should
say
,
a
couple
of
hundred
yards
towards
Cobb
's
Hole
,
when
Sergeant
Cuff
suddenly
went
down
on
his
knees
on
the
beach
,
to
all
appearance
seized
with
a
sudden
frenzy
for
saying
his
prayers
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
something
to
be
said
for
your
marine
landscape
here
,
after
all
,
"
remarked
the
Sergeant
.
<EOS>
"
Here
are
a
woman
's
footsteps
,
Mr.
Betteredge
!
<EOS>
Let
us
call
them
Rosanna
's
footsteps
,
until
we
find
evidence
to
the
contrary
that
we
ca
n't
resist
.
<EOS>
Very
confused
footsteps
,
you
will
please
to
observe
 
purposely
confused
,
I
should
say
.
<EOS>
Ah
,
poor
soul
,
she
understands
the
detective
virtues
of
sand
as
well
as
I
do
!
<EOS>
But
has
n't
she
been
in
rather
too
great
a
hurry
to
tread
out
the
marks
thoroughly
?
<EOS>
I
think
she
has
.
<EOS>
Here
's
one
footstep
going
FROM
Cobb
's
Hole
;
and
here
is
another
going
back
to
it
.
<EOS>
Is
n't
that
the
toe
of
her
shoe
pointing
straight
to
the
water
's
edge
?
<EOS>
And
do
n't
I
see
two
heel
-
marks
further
down
the
beach
,
close
at
the
water
's
edge
also
?
<EOS>
I
do
n't
want
to
hurt
your
feelings
,
but
I
'm
afraid
Rosanna
is
sly
.
<EOS>
It
looks
as
if
she
had
determined
to
get
to
that
place
you
<EOS>
and
I
have
just
come
from
,
without
leaving
any
marks
on
the
sand
to
trace
her
by
.
<EOS>
Shall
we
say
that
she
walked
through
the
water
from
this
point
till
she
got
to
that
ledge
of
rocks
behind
us
,
and
came
back
the
same
way
,
and
then
took
to
the
beach
again
where
those
two
heel
marks
are
still
left
?
<EOS>
Yes
,
we
'll
say
that
.
<EOS>
It
seems
to
fit
in
with
my
notion
that
she
had
something
under
her
cloak
,
when
she
left
the
cottage
.
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
not
something
to
destroy
 
for
,
in
that
case
,
where
would
have
been
the
need
of
all
these
precautions
to
prevent
my
tracing
the
place
at
which
her
walk
ended
?
<EOS>
Something
to
hide
is
,
I
think
,
the
better
guess
of
the
two
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
,
if
we
go
on
to
the
cottage
,
we
may
find
out
what
that
something
is
?
"
  
<EOS>
At
this
proposal
,
my
detective
-
fever
suddenly
cooled
.
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
want
me
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
What
good
can
I
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
longer
I
know
you
,
Mr.
Betteredge
,
"
said
the
Sergeant
,
"
the
more
virtues
I
discover
.
<EOS>
Modesty
 
<EOS>
oh
dear
me
<EOS>
,
how
rare
modesty
is
in
this
world
!
<EOS>
and
how
much
of
that
rarity
you
possess
!
<EOS>
If
I
go
alone
to
the
cottage
,
the
people
's
tongues
will
be
tied
at
the
first
question
I
put
to
them
.
<EOS>
If
I
go
with
you
,
I
go
introduced
by
a
justly
respected
neighbour
,
and
a
flow
of
conversation
is
the
necessary
result
.
<EOS>
It
strikes
me
in
that
light
;
how
does
it
strike
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
Not
having
an
answer
of
the
needful
smartness
as
ready
as
I
could
have
wished
,
I
tried
to
gain
time
by
asking
him
what
cottage
he
wanted
to
go
to
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
Sergeant
describing
the
place
,
I
recognised
it
as
a
cottage
inhabited
by
a
fisherman
named
Yolland
,
with
his
wife
and
two
grown
-
up
children
,
a
son
and
a
daughter
.
<EOS>
If
you
will
look
back
,
you
will
find
that
,
in
first
presenting
Rosanna
Spearman
to
your
notice
,
I
have
described
her
as
occasionally
varying
her
walk
to
the
Shivering
Sand
,
by
a
visit
to
some
friends
of
hers
at
Cobb
's
Hole
.
<EOS>
Those
friends
were
the
Yollands
 
respectable
,
worthy
people
,
a
credit
to
the
neighbourhood
.
<EOS>
Rosanna
's
acquaintance
with
them
had
begun
by
means
of
the
daughter
,
who
was
afflicted
with
a
misshapen
foot
,
and
who
was
known
in
our
parts
by
the
name
of
Limping
Lucy
.
<EOS>
The
two
deformed
girls
had
,
I
suppose
,
a
kind
of
fellow
-
feeling
for
each
other
.
<EOS>
Anyway
,
the
Yollands
and
Rosanna
always
appeared
to
get
on
together
,
at
the
few
chances
they
had
of
meeting
,
in
a
pleasant
and
friendly
manner
.
<EOS>
The
fact
of
Sergeant
Cuff
having
traced
the
girl
to
THEIR
cottage
,
set
the
matter
of
my
helping
his
inquiries
in
quite
a
new
light
.
<EOS>
Rosanna
had
merely
gone
where
she
was
in
the
habit
of
going
;
and
to
show
that
she
had
been
in
company
with
the
fisherman
and
his
family
was
as
good
as
to
prove
that
she
had
been
innocently
occupied
so
far
,
at
any
rate
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
doing
the
girl
a
service
,
therefore
,
instead
of
an
injury
,
if
I
allowed
myself
to
be
convinced
by
Sergeant
Cuff
's
logic
.
<EOS>
I
professed
myself
convinced
by
it
accordingly
.
  
<EOS>
We
went
on
to
Cobb
's
Hole
,
seeing
the
footsteps
on
the
sand
,
as
long
as
the
light
lasted
.
  
<EOS>
On
reaching
the
cottage
,
the
fisherman
and
his
son
proved
to
be
out
in
the
boat
;
and
Limping
Lucy
,
always
weak
and
weary
,
was
resting
on
her
bed
up
-
stairs
.
<EOS>
Good
Mrs.
Yolland
received
us
alone
in
her
kitchen
.
<EOS>
When
she
heard
that
Sergeant
Cuff
was
a
celebrated
character
in
London
,
she
clapped
a
bottle
of
Dutch
gin
and
a
couple
of
clean
pipes
on
the
table
,
and
stared
as
if
she
could
never
see
enough
of
him
.
  
<EOS>
I
sat
quiet
in
a
corner
,
waiting
to
hear
how
the
Sergeant
would
find
his
way
to
the
subject
of
Rosanna
Spearman
.
<EOS>
His
usual
roundabout
manner
of
going
to
work
proved
,
on
this
occasion
,
to
be
more
roundabout
than
ever
.
<EOS>
How
he
managed
it
is
more
than
I
could
tell
at
the
time
,
and
more
than
I
can
tell
now
.
<EOS>
But
this
is
certain
,
he
began
with
the
Royal
Family
,
the
Primitive
Methodists
,
and
the
price
of
fish
;
and
he
got
from
that
(
in
his
dismal
,
underground
way
)
to
the
loss
of
the
Moonstone
,
the
spitefulness
of
our
first
house
-
maid
,
and
the
hard
behaviour
of
the
women
-
servants
generally
towards
Rosanna
Spearman
.
<EOS>
Having
reached
his
subject
in
this
fashion
,
he
described
himself
as
making
his
inquiries
about
the
lost
Diamond
,
partly
with
a
view
to
find
it
,
and
partly
for
the
purpose
of
clearing
Rosanna
from
the
unjust
suspicions
of
her
enemies
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
In
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
from
the
time
when
we
entered
the
kitchen
,
good
Mrs.
Yolland
was
persuaded
that
she
was
talking
to
Rosanna
's
best
friend
,
and
was
pressing
Sergeant
Cuff
to
comfort
his
stomach
and
revive
his
spirits
out
of
the
Dutch
bottle
.
  
<EOS>
Being
firmly
persuaded
that
the
Sergeant
was
wasting
his
breath
to
no
purpose
on
Mrs.
Yolland
,
I
sat
enjoying
the
talk
between
them
,
much
as
I
have
sat
,
in
my
time
,
enjoying
a
stage
play
.
<EOS>
The
great
Cuff
showed
a
wonderful
patience
;
trying
his
luck
drearily
this
way
and
that
way
,
and
firing
shot
after
shot
,
as
it
were
,
at
random
,
on
the
chance
of
hitting
the
mark
.
<EOS>
Everything
to
Rosanna
's
credit
,
nothing
to
Rosanna
's
prejudice
 
<EOS>
that
was
how
it
ended
,
try
as
he
might
;
with
Mrs.
Yolland
talking
nineteen
to
the
dozen
,
and
placing
the
most
entire
confidence
in
him
.
<EOS>
His
last
effort
was
made
,
when
we
had
looked
at
our
watches
,
and
had
got
on
our
legs
previous
to
taking
leave
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
now
wish
you
good
-
night
,
ma'am
,
"
says
the
Sergeant
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
I
shall
only
say
,
at
parting
,
that
Rosanna
Spearman
has
a
sincere
well
-
wisher
in
myself
,
your
obedient
servant
.
<EOS>
But
,
oh
dear
me
!
<EOS>
she
will
never
get
on
in
her
present
place
;
and
my
advice
to
her
is
 
<EOS>
leave
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Bless
your
heart
alive
!
<EOS>
she
is
GOING
to
leave
it
!
"
<EOS>
cries
Mrs.
Yolland
.
<EOS>
(
NOTA
BENE
 
<EOS>
I
translate
Mrs.
Yolland
out
of
the
Yorkshire
language
into
the
English
language
.
<EOS>
When
I
tell
you
that
the
all
-
accomplished
Cuff
was
every
now
and
then
puzzled
to
understand
her
until
I
helped
him
,
you
will
draw
your
own
conclusions
as
to
what
your
state
of
mind
would
be
if
I
reported
her
in
her
native
tongue
.
)
  
<EOS>
Rosanna
Spearman
going
to
leave
us
!
<EOS>
I
pricked
up
my
ears
at
that
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
strange
,
to
say
the
least
of
it
,
that
she
should
have
given
no
warning
,
in
the
first
place
,
to
my
lady
or
to
me
.
<EOS>
A
certain
doubt
came
up
in
my
mind
whether
Sergeant
Cuff
's
last
random
shot
might
not
have
hit
the
mark
.
<EOS>
I
began
to
question
whether
my
share
in
the
proceedings
was
quite
as
harmless
a
one
as
I
had
thought
it
.
<EOS>
It
might
be
all
in
the
way
of
the
Sergeant
's
business
to
mystify
an
honest
woman
by
wrapping
her
round
in
a
network
of
lies
but
it
was
my
duty
to
have
remembered
,
as
a
good
Protestant
,
that
the
father
of
lies
is
the
Devil
 
and
<EOS>
that
mischief
and
the
Devil
are
never
far
apart
.
<EOS>
Beginning
to
smell
mischief
in
the
air
,
I
tried
to
take
Sergeant
Cuff
out
.
<EOS>
He
sat
down
again
instantly
,
and
asked
for
a
little
drop
of
comfort
out
of
the
Dutch
bottle
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Yolland
sat
down
opposite
to
him
,
and
gave
him
his
nip
.
<EOS>
I
went
on
to
the
door
,
excessively
uncomfortable
,
and
said
I
thought
I
must
bid
them
good
-
night
 
<EOS>
and
yet
I
did
n't
go
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
she
means
to
leave
?
"
says
the
Sergeant
.
<EOS>
"
What
is
she
to
do
when
she
does
leave
?
<EOS>
Sad
,
sad
!
<EOS>
The
poor
creature
has
got
no
friends
in
the
world
,
except
you
and
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
but
she
has
though
!
"
says
Mrs.
Yolland
.
<EOS>
"
She
came
in
here
,
as
I
told
you
,
this
evening
;
and
,
after
sitting
and
talking
a
little
with
my
girl
Lucy
and
me
she
asked
to
go
up
-
stairs
by
herself
,
into
Lucy
's
room
.
<EOS>
It
's
the
only
room
in
our
place
where
there
's
pen
and
ink
.
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
write
a
letter
to
a
friend
,
"
she
says
"
<EOS>
and
I
ca
n't
do
it
for
the
prying
and
peeping
of
the
servants
up
at
the
house
.
<EOS>
"
Who
the
letter
was
written
to
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
tell
you
:
it
must
have
been
a
mortal
long
one
,
judging
by
the
time
she
stopped
up
-
stairs
over
it
.
<EOS>
I
offered
her
a
postage
-
stamp
when
she
came
down
.
<EOS>
She
had
n't
got
the
letter
in
her
hand
,
and
she
did
n't
accept
the
stamp
.
<EOS>
A
little
close
,
poor
soul
(
as
you
know
)
,
about
herself
and
her
doings
.
<EOS>
But
a
friend
she
has
got
somewhere
,
I
can
tell
you
;
and
to
that
friend
you
may
depend
upon
it
,
she
will
go
.
"
  
"
Soon
?
"
asked
the
Sergeant
.
  
<EOS>
"
As
soon
as
she
can
.
"
says
Mrs.
Yolland
.
  
<EOS>
Here
I
stepped
in
again
from
the
door
.
<EOS>
As
chief
of
my
lady
's
establishment
,
I
could
n't
allow
this
sort
of
loose
talk
about
a
servant
of
ours
going
,
or
not
going
,
to
proceed
any
longer
in
my
presence
,
without
noticing
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
be
mistaken
about
Rosanna
Spearman
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
If
she
had
been
going
to
leave
her
present
situation
,
she
would
have
mentioned
it
,
in
the
first
place
,
to
_
me
_
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mistaken
?
"
cries
Mrs.
Yolland
.
<EOS>
"
Why
,
only
an
hour
ago
she
bought
some
things
she
wanted
for
travelling
 
of
my
own
self
,
Mr.
Betteredge
,
in
this
very
room
.
<EOS>
And
that
reminds
me
,
"
says
the
wearisome
woman
,
suddenly
beginning
to
feel
in
her
pocket
,
"
of
something
I
have
got
it
on
my
mind
to
say
about
Rosanna
and
her
money
.
<EOS>
Are
you
either
of
you
likely
to
see
her
when
you
go
back
to
the
house
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
take
a
message
to
the
poor
thing
,
with
the
greatest
pleasure
,
"
answered
Sergeant
Cuff
,
before
I
could
put
in
a
word
edgewise
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Yolland
produced
out
of
her
pocket
,
a
few
shillings
and
sixpences
,
and
counted
them
out
with
a
most
particular
and
exasperating
carefulness
in
the
palm
of
her
hand
.
<EOS>
She
offered
the
money
to
the
Sergeant
,
looking
mighty
loth
to
part
with
it
all
the
while
.
  
<EOS>
"
Might
I
ask
you
to
give
this
back
to
Rosanna
,
with
my
love
and
respects
?
"
says
Mrs.
Yolland
.
<EOS>
"
She
insisted
on
paying
me
for
the
one
or
two
things
she
took
a
fancy
to
this
evening
 
and
money
's
welcome
enough
in
our
house
,
I
do
n't
deny
it
.
<EOS>
Still
,
I
'm
not
easy
in
my
mind
about
taking
the
poor
thing
's
little
savings
.
<EOS>
And
to
tell
you
the
truth
,
I
do
n't
think
my
man
would
like
to
hear
that
I
had
taken
Rosanna
Spearman
's
money
,
when
he
comes
back
to
-
morrow
morning
from
his
work
.
<EOS>
Please
say
she
's
heartily
welcome
to
the
things
she
bought
of
me
 
as
a
gift
.
<EOS>
And
do
n't
leave
the
money
on
the
table
,
"
says
Mrs.
Yolland
,
putting
it
down
suddenly
before
the
Sergeant
,
as
if
it
burnt
her
fingers
 
"
do
n't
,
there
's
a
good
man
!
<EOS>
For
times
are
hard
,
and
flesh
is
weak
;
and
I
MIGHT
feel
tempted
to
put
it
back
in
my
pocket
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Come
along
!
"
<EOS>
I
said
,
"
I
ca
n't
wait
any
longer
:
I
must
go
back
to
the
house
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
follow
you
directly
,
"
says
Sergeant
Cuff
.
  
<EOS>
For
the
second
time
,
I
went
to
the
door
;
and
,
for
the
second
time
,
try
as
I
might
,
I
could
n't
cross
the
threshold
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
delicate
matter
,
ma'am
,
"
<EOS>
I
heard
the
Sergeant
say
,
"
giving
money
back
.
<EOS>
You
charged
her
cheap
for
the
things
,
I
'm
sure
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Cheap
!
"
says
Mrs.
Yolland
.
<EOS>
"
Come
and
judge
for
yourself
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
took
up
the
candle
and
led
the
Sergeant
to
a
corner
of
the
kitchen
.
<EOS>
For
the
life
of
me
,
I
could
n't
help
following
them
.
<EOS>
Shaken
down
in
the
corner
was
a
heap
of
odds
and
ends
(
mostly
old
metal
)
,
which
the
fisherman
had
picked
up
at
different
times
from
wrecked
ships
,
and
which
he
had
n't
found
a
market
for
yet
,
to
his
own
mind
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Yolland
dived
into
this
rubbish
,
and
brought
up
an
old
japanned
tin
case
,
with
a
cover
to
it
,
and
a
hasp
to
hang
it
up
by
 
the
sort
of
thing
they
use
,
on
board
ship
,
for
keeping
their
maps
and
charts
,
and
such
-
like
,
from
the
wet
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
!
"
says
she
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
When
Rosanna
came
in
this
evening
,
she
bought
the
fellow
to
that
.
<EOS>
"
It
will
just
do
,
"
she
says
,
"
to
put
my
cuffs
and
collars
in
,
and
keep
them
from
being
crumpled
in
my
box
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
One
and
ninepence
,
Mr.
Cuff
.
<EOS>
As
I
live
by
bread
,
not
a
halfpenny
more
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Dirt
cheap
!
"
says
the
Sergeant
,
with
a
heavy
sigh
.
  
<EOS>
He
weighed
the
case
in
his
hand
.
<EOS>
I
thought
I
heard
a
note
or
two
of
"
The
Last
Rose
of
Summer
"
as
he
looked
at
it
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
doubt
now
!
<EOS>
He
had
made
another
discovery
to
the
prejudice
of
Rosanna
Spearman
,
in
the
place
of
all
others
where
I
thought
her
character
was
safest
,
and
all
through
me
!
<EOS>
I
leave
you
to
imagine
what
I
felt
,
and
how
sincerely
I
repented
having
been
the
medium
of
introduction
between
Mrs.
Yolland
and
Sergeant
Cuff
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
will
do
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
We
really
must
go
.
"
  
<EOS>
Without
paying
the
least
attention
to
me
,
Mrs.
Yolland
took
another
dive
into
the
rubbish
,
and
came
up
out
of
it
,
this
time
,
with
a
dog
-
chain
.
  
<EOS>
"
Weigh
it
in
your
hand
,
sir
,
"
she
said
to
the
Sergeant
.
<EOS>
"
We
had
three
of
these
;
and
Rosanna
has
taken
two
of
them
.
<EOS>
"
What
can
you
want
,
my
dear
,
with
a
couple
of
dog
's
chains
?
"
says
I.
"
<EOS>
If
I
join
them
together
they
'll
do
round
my
box
nicely
,
"
says
she
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Rope
's
cheapest
,
"
says
I.
"
Chain
's
surest
,
"
says
she
.
<EOS>
"
Who
ever
heard
of
a
box
corded
with
chain
,
"
says
I.
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Mrs.
Yolland
,
do
n't
make
objections
!
"
<EOS>
says
she
;
"
let
me
have
my
chains
!
"
<EOS>
A
strange
girl
,
Mr.
Cuff
 
good
as
gold
,
and
kinder
than
a
sister
to
my
Lucy
 
but
always
a
little
strange
.
<EOS>
There
!
<EOS>
I
humoured
her
.
<EOS>
Three
and
sixpence
.
<EOS>
On
the
word
of
an
honest
woman
,
three
and
sixpence
,
Mr.
Cuff
!
"
  
"
Each
?
"
says
the
Sergeant
.
  
<EOS>
"
Both
together
!
"
says
Mrs.
Yolland
.
<EOS>
"
Three
and
sixpence
for
the
two
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Given
away
,
ma'am
,
"
says
the
Sergeant
,
shaking
his
head
.
<EOS>
"
Clean
given
away
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
the
money
,
"
says
Mrs.
Yolland
,
getting
back
sideways
to
the
little
heap
of
silver
on
the
table
,
as
if
it
drew
her
in
spite
of
herself
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
tin
case
and
the
dog
chains
were
all
she
bought
,
and
all
she
took
away
.
<EOS>
One
and
ninepence
and
three
and
sixpence
 
total
,
five
and
three
.
<EOS>
With
my
love
and
respects
 
<EOS>
and
I
ca
n't
find
it
in
my
conscience
to
take
a
poor
girl
's
savings
,
when
she
may
want
them
herself

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
find
it
in
MY
conscience
,
ma'am
,
to
give
the
money
back

says
Sergeant
Cuff
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
as
good
as
made
her
a
present
of
the
things
 
you
have
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
that
your
sincere
opinion
,
sir
?
"
says
Mrs.
Yolland
brightening
up
wonderfully
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
ca
n't
be
a
doubt
about
it
,
"
answered
the
Sergeant
.
"
<EOS>
Ask
Mr.
Betteredge
.
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
no
use
asking
ME
.
<EOS>
All
they
got
out
of
ME
was
,
"
Good
-
night
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Bother
the
money
!
"
says
Mrs.
Yolland
.
<EOS>
With
these
words
,
she
appeared
to
lose
all
command
over
herself
;
and
,
making
a
sudden
snatch
at
the
heap
of
silver
,
put
it
back
,
holus
-
bolus
,
in
her
pocket
.
<EOS>
"
It
upsets
one
's
temper
,
it
does
,
to
see
it
lying
there
,
and
nobody
taking
it
,
"
cries
this
unreasonable
woman
,
sitting
down
with
a
thump
,
and
looking
at
Sergeant
Cuff
,
as
much
as
to
say
,
"
It
's
in
my
pocket
again
now
 
get
it
out
if
you
can
!
"
  
<EOS>
This
time
,
I
not
only
went
to
the
door
,
but
went
fairly
out
on
the
road
back
.
<EOS>
Explain
it
how
you
may
,
I
felt
as
if
one
or
both
of
them
had
mortally
offended
me
.
<EOS>
Before
I
had
taken
three
steps
down
the
village
,
I
heard
the
Sergeant
behind
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
for
your
introduction
,
Mr.
Betteredge
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
indebted
to
the
fisherman
's
wife
for
an
entirely
new
sensation
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Yolland
has
puzzled
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
on
the
tip
of
my
tongue
to
have
given
him
a
sharp
answer
,
for
no
better
reason
than
this
 
that
I
was
out
of
temper
with
him
,
because
I
was
out
of
temper
with
myself
.
<EOS>
But
when
he
owned
to
being
puzzled
,
a
comforting
doubt
crossed
my
mind
whether
any
great
harm
had
been
done
after
all
.
<EOS>
I
waited
in
discreet
silence
to
hear
more
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
says
the
Sergeant
,
as
if
he
was
actually
reading
my
thoughts
in
the
dark
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Instead
of
putting
me
on
the
scent
,
it
may
console
you
to
know
,
Mr.
Betteredge
(
with
your
interest
in
Rosanna
)
,
that
you
have
been
the
means
of
throwing
me
off
.
<EOS>
What
the
girl
has
done
,
to
-
night
,
is
clear
enough
,
of
course
.
<EOS>
She
has
joined
the
two
chains
,
and
has
fastened
them
to
the
hasp
in
the
tin
case
.
<EOS>
She
has
sunk
the
case
,
in
the
water
or
in
the
quicksand
.
<EOS>
She
has
made
the
loose
end
of
the
chain
fast
to
some
place
under
the
rocks
,
known
only
to
herself
.
<EOS>
And
she
will
leave
the
case
secure
at
its
anchorage
till
the
present
proceedings
have
come
to
an
end
;
after
which
she
can
privately
pull
it
up
again
out
of
its
hiding
-
place
,
at
her
own
leisure
and
convenience
.
<EOS>
All
perfectly
plain
,
so
far
.
<EOS>
But
,
"
says
the
Sergeant
,
with
the
first
tone
of
impatience
in
his
voice
that
I
had
heard
yet
,
"
the
mystery
is
 
what
the
devil
has
she
hidden
in
the
tin
case
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
thought
to
myself
,
"
The
Moonstone
!
"
<EOS>
But
I
only
said
to
Sergeant
Cuff
,
"
Ca
n't
you
guess
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
not
the
Diamond
,
"
says
the
Sergeant
.
<EOS>
"
The
whole
experience
of
my
life
is
at
fault
,
if
Rosanna
Spearman
has
got
the
Diamond
.
"
  
<EOS>
On
hearing
those
words
,
the
infernal
detective
-
fever
began
,
I
suppose
,
to
burn
in
me
again
.
<EOS>
At
any
rate
,
I
forgot
myself
in
the
interest
of
guessing
this
new
riddle
.
<EOS>
I
said
rashly
,
"
The
stained
dress
!
"
  
<EOS>
Sergeant
Cuff
stopped
short
in
the
dark
,
and
laid
his
hand
on
my
arm
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
anything
thrown
into
that
quicksand
of
yours
,
ever
thrown
up
on
the
surface
again
?
"
he
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
Never
,
"
I
answered
.
<EOS>
"
Light
or
heavy
whatever
goes
into
the
Shivering
Sand
is
sucked
down
,
and
seen
no
more
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Does
Rosanna
Spearman
know
that
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
knows
it
as
well
as
I
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
,
"
says
the
Sergeant
,
"
what
on
earth
has
she
got
to
do
but
to
tie
up
a
bit
of
stone
in
the
stained
dress
and
throw
it
into
the
quicksand
?
<EOS>
There
is
n't
the
shadow
of
a
reason
why
she
should
have
hidden
it
 
<EOS>
and
yet
she
must
have
hidden
it
.
<EOS>
Query
,
"
says
the
Sergeant
,
walking
on
again
,
"
is
the
paint
-
stained
dress
a
petticoat
or
a
night
-
gown
?
<EOS>
or
is
it
something
else
which
there
is
a
reason
for
preserving
at
any
risk
?
<EOS>
Mr.
Betteredge
,
if
nothing
occurs
to
prevent
it
,
I
must
go
to
Frizinghall
to
-
morrow
,
and
discover
what
she
bought
in
the
town
,
when
she
privately
got
the
materials
for
making
the
substitute
dress
.
<EOS>
It
's
a
risk
to
leave
the
house
,
as
things
are
now
 
<EOS>
but
it
's
a
worse
risk
still
to
stir
another
step
in
this
matter
in
the
dark
.
<EOS>
Excuse
my
being
a
little
out
of
temper
<EOS>
;
I
'm
degraded
in
my
own
estimation
 
I
have
let
Rosanna
Spearman
puzzle
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
When
we
got
back
,
the
servants
were
at
supper
.
<EOS>
The
first
person
we
saw
in
the
outer
yard
was
the
policeman
whom
Superintendent
Seegrave
had
left
at
the
Sergeant
's
disposal
.
<EOS>
The
Sergeant
asked
if
Rosanna
Spearman
had
returned
.
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
When
?
<EOS>
Nearly
an
hour
since
.
<EOS>
What
had
she
done
?
<EOS>
She
had
gone
up
-
stairs
to
take
off
her
bonnet
and
cloak
 
<EOS>
and
she
was
now
at
supper
quietly
with
the
rest
.
  
<EOS>
Without
making
any
remark
,
Sergeant
Cuff
walked
on
,
sinking
lower
and
lower
in
his
own
estimation
,
to
the
back
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
Missing
the
entrance
in
the
dark
,
he
went
on
(
in
spite
of
my
calling
to
him
)
till
he
was
stopped
by
a
wicket
-
gate
which
led
into
the
garden
.
<EOS>
When
I
joined
him
to
bring
him
back
by
the
right
way
,
I
found
that
he
was
looking
up
attentively
at
one
particular
window
,
on
the
bed
-
room
floor
,
at
the
back
of
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
Looking
up
,
in
my
turn
,
I
discovered
that
the
object
of
his
contemplation
was
the
window
of
Miss
Rachel
's
room
,
and
that
lights
were
passing
backwards
and
forwards
there
as
if
something
unusual
was
going
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
n't
that
Miss
Verinder
's
room
?
"
asked
Sergeant
Cuff
.
  
<EOS>
I
replied
that
it
was
,
and
invited
him
to
go
in
with
me
to
supper
.
<EOS>
The
Sergeant
remained
in
his
place
,
and
said
something
about
enjoying
the
smell
of
the
garden
at
night
.
<EOS>
I
left
him
to
his
enjoyment
.
<EOS>
Just
as
I
was
turning
in
at
the
door
,
I
heard
"
<EOS>
The
Last
Rose
of
Summer
"
at
the
wicket
-
gate
.
<EOS>
Sergeant
Cuff
had
made
another
discovery
!
<EOS>
And
my
young
lady
's
window
was
at
the
bottom
of
it
this
time
!
  
<EOS>
The
latter
reflection
took
me
back
again
to
the
Sergeant
,
with
a
polite
intimation
that
I
could
not
find
it
in
my
heart
to
leave
him
by
himself
.
<EOS>
"
Is
there
anything
you
do
n't
understand
up
there
?
"
<EOS>
I
added
,
pointing
to
Miss
Rachel
's
window
.
  
<EOS>
Judging
by
his
voice
,
Sergeant
Cuff
had
suddenly
risen
again
to
the
right
place
in
his
own
estimation
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
great
people
for
betting
in
Yorkshire
,
are
you
not
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
?
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
Suppose
we
are
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
was
a
Yorkshireman
,
"
proceeded
the
Sergeant
,
taking
my
arm
,
"
I
would
lay
you
an
even
sovereign
,
Mr.
Betteredge
,
that
your
young
lady
has
suddenly
resolved
to
leave
the
house
.
<EOS>
If
I
won
on
that
event
,
I
should
offer
to
lay
another
sovereign
,
that
the
idea
has
occurred
to
her
within
the
last
hour
.
<EOS>
"
The
first
of
the
Sergeant
's
guesses
startled
me
.
<EOS>
The
second
mixed
itself
up
somehow
in
my
head
with
the
report
we
had
heard
from
the
policeman
,
that
Rosanna
Spearman
had
returned
from
the
sands
with
in
the
last
hour
.
<EOS>
The
two
together
had
a
curious
effect
on
me
as
we
went
in
to
supper
.
<EOS>
I
shook
off
Sergeant
Cuff
's
arm
,
and
,
forgetting
my
manners
,
pushed
by
him
through
the
door
to
make
my
own
inquiries
for
myself
.
  
<EOS>
Samuel
,
the
footman
,
was
the
first
person
I
met
in
the
passage
.
  
<EOS>
"
Her
ladyship
is
waiting
to
see
you
and
Sergeant
Cuff
,
"
he
said
,
before
I
could
put
any
questions
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
long
has
she
been
waiting
?
"
<EOS>
asked
the
Sergeant
's
voice
behind
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
For
the
last
hour
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
it
was
again
!
<EOS>
Rosanna
had
come
back
;
Miss
Rachel
had
taken
some
resolution
out
of
the
common
;
and
my
lady
had
been
waiting
to
see
the
Sergeant
 
all
within
the
last
hour
!
<EOS>
It
was
not
pleasant
to
find
these
very
different
persons
and
things
linking
themselves
together
in
this
way
.
<EOS>
I
went
on
upstairs
,
without
looking
at
Sergeant
Cuff
,
or
speaking
to
him
.
<EOS>
My
hand
took
a
sudden
fit
of
trembling
as
I
lifted
it
to
knock
at
my
mistress
's
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
n't
be
surprised
,
"
whispered
the
Sergeant
over
my
shoulder
,
"
if
a
scandal
was
to
burst
up
in
the
house
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
be
alarmed
!
<EOS>
I
have
put
the
muzzle
on
worse
family
difficulties
than
this
,
in
my
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
As
he
said
the
words
I
heard
my
mistress
's
voice
calling
to
us
to
come
in
.
    
<EOS>
We
found
my
lady
with
no
light
in
the
room
but
the
reading
-
lamp
.
<EOS>
The
shade
was
screwed
down
so
as
to
overshadow
her
face
.
<EOS>
Instead
of
looking
up
at
us
in
her
usual
straightforward
way
,
she
sat
close
at
the
table
,
and
kept
her
eyes
fixed
obstinately
on
an
open
book
.
  
<EOS>
"
Officer
,
"
she
said
,
"
is
it
important
to
the
inquiry
you
are
conducting
,
to
know
beforehand
if
any
person
now
in
this
house
wishes
to
leave
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Most
important
,
my
lady
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
to
tell
you
,
then
,
that
Miss
Verinder
proposes
going
to
stay
with
her
aunt
,
Mrs.
Ablewhite
,
of
Frizinghall
.
<EOS>
She
has
arranged
to
leave
us
the
first
thing
to
-
morrow
morning
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Sergeant
Cuff
looked
at
me
.
<EOS>
I
made
a
step
forward
to
speak
to
my
mistress
 
and
,
feeling
my
heart
fail
me
<EOS>
(
if
I
must
own
it
)
,
took
a
step
back
again
,
and
said
nothing
.
  
<EOS>
"
May
I
ask
your
ladyship
WHEN
Miss
Verinder
informed
you
that
she
was
going
to
her
aunt
's
?
"
inquired
the
Sergeant
.
  
<EOS>
"
About
an
hour
since
,
"
answered
my
mistress
.
  
<EOS>
Sergeant
Cuff
looked
at
me
once
more
.
<EOS>
They
say
old
people
's
hearts
are
not
very
easily
moved
.
<EOS>
My
heart
could
n't
have
thumped
much
harder
than
it
did
now
,
if
I
had
been
five
-
and
-
twenty
again
!
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
claim
,
my
lady
,
"
says
the
Sergeant
,
"
to
control
Miss
Verinder
's
actions
.
<EOS>
All
I
can
ask
you
to
do
is
to
put
off
her
departure
,
if
possible
,
till
later
in
the
day
.
<EOS>
I
must
go
to
Frizinghall
myself
to
-
morrow
morning
 
<EOS>
and
I
shall
be
back
by
two
o'clock
,
if
not
before
.
<EOS>
If
Miss
Verinder
can
be
kept
here
till
that
time
,
I
should
wish
to
say
two
words
to
her
 
unexpectedly
 
before
she
goes
.
"
  
<EOS>
My
lady
directed
me
to
give
the
coachman
her
orders
,
that
the
carriage
was
not
to
come
for
Miss
Rachel
until
two
o'clock
.
"
<EOS>
Have
you
more
to
say
?
<EOS>
"
she
asked
of
the
Sergeant
,
when
this
had
been
done
.
  
<EOS>
"
Only
one
thing
,
your
ladyship
.
<EOS>
If
Miss
Verinder
is
surprised
at
this
change
in
the
arrangements
,
please
not
to
mention
Me
as
being
the
cause
of
putting
off
her
journey
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
My
mistress
lifted
her
head
suddenly
from
her
book
as
if
she
was
going
to
say
something
 
<EOS>
checked
herself
by
a
great
effort
 
and
,
looking
back
again
at
the
open
page
,
dismissed
us
with
a
sign
of
her
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
a
wonderful
woman
,
"
said
Sergeant
Cuff
,
when
we
were
out
in
the
hall
again
.
<EOS>
"
But
for
her
self
-
control
,
the
mystery
that
puzzles
you
,
Mr.
Betteredge
,
would
have
been
at
an
end
to
-
night
.
"
  
<EOS>
At
those
words
,
the
truth
rushed
at
last
into
my
stupid
old
head
.
<EOS>
For
the
moment
,
I
suppose
I
must
have
gone
clean
out
of
my
senses
.
<EOS>
I
seized
the
Sergeant
by
the
collar
of
his
coat
,
and
pinned
him
against
the
wall
.
  
<EOS>
"
Damn
you
!
"
<EOS>
I
cried
out
,
"
there
's
something
wrong
about
Miss
Rachel
 
<EOS>
and
you
have
been
hiding
it
from
me
all
this
time
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Sergeant
Cuff
looked
up
at
me
 
flat
against
the
wall
 
without
stirring
a
hand
,
or
moving
a
muscle
of
his
melancholy
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
"
he
said
,
"
you
've
guessed
it
at
last
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
My
hand
dropped
from
his
collar
,
and
my
head
sunk
on
my
breast
.
<EOS>
Please
to
remember
,
as
some
excuse
for
my
breaking
out
as
I
did
,
that
I
had
served
the
family
for
fifty
years
.
<EOS>
Miss
Rachel
had
climbed
upon
my
knees
,
and
pulled
my
whiskers
,
many
and
many
a
time
when
she
was
a
child
.
<EOS>
Miss
Rachel
,
with
all
her
faults
,
had
been
,
to
my
mind
,
the
dearest
and
prettiest
and
best
young
mistress
that
ever
an
old
servant
waited
on
,
and
loved
.
<EOS>
I
begged
Sergeant
's
Cuff
's
pardon
,
but
I
am
afraid
I
did
it
with
watery
eyes
,
and
not
in
a
very
becoming
way
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
distress
yourself
,
Mr.
Betteredge
,
"
says
the
Sergeant
,
with
more
kindness
than
I
had
any
right
to
expect
from
him
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
In
my
line
of
life
if
we
were
quick
at
taking
offence
,
we
should
n't
be
worth
salt
to
our
porridge
.
<EOS>
If
it
's
any
comfort
to
you
,
collar
me
again
.
<EOS>
You
do
n't
in
the
least
<EOS>
know
how
to
do
it
;
but
I
'll
overlook
your
awkwardness
in
consideration
of
your
feelings
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
curled
up
at
the
corners
of
his
lips
,
and
,
in
his
own
dreary
way
,
seemed
to
think
he
had
delivered
himself
of
a
very
good
joke
.
  
<EOS>
I
led
him
into
my
own
little
sitting
-
room
,
and
closed
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
Tell
me
the
truth
,
Sergeant
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
suspect
?
<EOS>
It
's
no
kindness
to
hide
it
from
me
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
suspect
,
"
said
Sergeant
Cuff
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
My
unlucky
temper
began
to
get
the
better
of
me
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
mean
to
tell
me
,
in
plain
English
,
"
I
said
,
"
that
Miss
Rachel
has
stolen
her
own
Diamond
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
says
the
Sergeant
;
"
that
is
what
I
mean
to
tell
you
,
in
so
many
words
.
<EOS>
Miss
Verinder
has
been
in
secret
possession
of
the
Moonstone
from
first
to
last
;
and
she
has
taken
Rosanna
Spearman
into
her
confidence
,
because
she
has
calculated
on
our
suspecting
Rosanna
Spearman
of
the
theft
.
<EOS>
There
is
the
whole
case
in
a
nutshell
.
<EOS>
Collar
me
again
,
Mr.
Betteredge
.
<EOS>
If
it
's
any
vent
to
your
feelings
,
collar
me
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
God
help
me
!
<EOS>
my
feelings
were
not
to
be
relieved
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
"
Give
me
your
reasons
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
That
was
all
I
could
say
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
shall
hear
my
reasons
to
-
morrow
,
"
said
the
Sergeant
.
<EOS>
"
If
Miss
Verinder
refuses
to
put
off
her
visit
to
her
aunt
(
which
you
will
find
Miss
Verinder
will
do
)
,
I
shall
be
obliged
to
lay
the
whole
case
before
your
mistress
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
And
,
as
I
do
n't
know
what
may
come
of
it
,
I
shall
request
you
to
be
present
,
and
to
hear
what
passes
on
both
sides
.
<EOS>
Let
the
matter
rest
for
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
No
,
Mr.
Betteredge
,
you
do
n't
get
a
word
more
on
the
subject
of
the
Moonstone
out
of
me
.
<EOS>
There
is
your
table
spread
for
supper
.
<EOS>
That
's
one
of
the
many
human
infirmities
which
I
always
treat
tenderly
.
<EOS>
If
you
will
ring
the
bell
,
I
'll
say
grace
.
<EOS>
"
For
what
we
are
going
to
receive
 
"
"
  
"
I
wish
you
a
good
appetite
to
it
,
Sergeant
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
My
appetite
is
gone
.
<EOS>
I
'll
wait
and
see
you
served
,
and
then
I
'll
ask
you
to
excuse
me
,
if
I
go
away
,
and
try
to
get
the
better
of
this
by
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
saw
him
served
with
the
best
of
everything
 
<EOS>
and
I
should
n't
have
been
sorry
if
the
best
of
everything
had
choked
him
.
<EOS>
The
head
gardener
(
Mr.
Begbie
)
came
in
at
the
same
time
,
with
his
weekly
account
.
<EOS>
The
Sergeant
got
on
the
subject
of
roses
and
the
merits
of
grass
walks
and
gravel
walks
immediately
.
<EOS>
I
left
the
two
together
,
and
went
out
with
a
heavy
heart
.
<EOS>
This
was
the
first
trouble
I
remember
for
many
a
long
year
which
was
n't
to
be
blown
off
by
a
whiff
of
tobacco
,
and
which
was
even
beyond
the
reach
of
ROBINSON
CRUSOE
.
  
<EOS>
Being
restless
and
miserable
,
and
having
no
particular
room
to
go
to
,
I
took
a
turn
on
the
terrace
,
and
thought
it
over
in
peace
and
quietness
by
myself
.
<EOS>
It
does
n't
much
matter
what
my
thoughts
were
.
<EOS>
I
felt
wretchedly
old
,
and
worn
out
,
and
unfit
for
my
place
 
and
began
to
wonder
,
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
,
when
it
would
please
God
to
take
me
.
<EOS>
With
all
this
,
I
held
firm
,
notwithstanding
,
to
my
belief
in
Miss
Rachel
.
<EOS>
If
Sergeant
Cuff
had
been
Solomon
in
all
his
glory
,
and
had
told
me
that
my
young
lady
had
mixed
herself
up
in
a
mean
and
guilty
plot
,
I
should
have
had
but
one
answer
for
Solomon
,
wise
as
he
was
,
"
<EOS>
You
do
n't
know
her
;
and
I
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
My
meditations
were
interrupted
by
Samuel
.
<EOS>
He
brought
me
a
written
message
from
my
mistress
.
  
<EOS>
Going
into
the
house
to
get
a
light
to
read
it
by
,
Samuel
remarked
that
there
seemed
a
change
coming
in
the
weather
.
<EOS>
My
troubled
mind
had
prevented
me
from
noticing
it
before
.
<EOS>
But
,
now
my
attention
was
roused
,
I
heard
the
dogs
uneasy
,
and
the
wind
moaning
low
.
<EOS>
Looking
up
at
the
sky
,
I
saw
the
rack
of
clouds
getting
blacker
and
blacker
,
and
hurrying
faster
and
faster
over
a
watery
moon
.
<EOS>
Wild
weather
coming
 
<EOS>
Samuel
was
right
,
wild
weather
coming
.
  
<EOS>
The
message
from
my
lady
informed
me
,
that
the
magistrate
at
Frizinghall
had
written
to
remind
her
about
the
three
Indians
.
<EOS>
Early
in
the
coming
week
,
the
rogues
must
needs
be
released
,
and
left
free
to
follow
their
own
devices
.
<EOS>
If
we
had
any
more
questions
to
ask
them
,
there
was
no
time
to
lose
.
<EOS>
Having
forgotten
to
mention
this
,
when
she
had
last
seen
Sergeant
Cuff
,
my
mistress
now
desired
me
to
supply
the
omission
.
<EOS>
The
Indians
had
gone
clean
out
of
my
head
(
as
they
have
,
no
doubt
,
gone
clean
out
of
yours
)
.
<EOS>
I
did
n't
see
much
use
in
stirring
that
subject
again
.
<EOS>
However
,
I
obeyed
my
orders
on
the
spot
,
as
a
matter
of
course
.
  
<EOS>
I
found
Sergeant
Cuff
and
the
gardener
,
with
a
bottle
of
Scotch
whisky
between
them
,
head
over
ears
in
an
argument
on
the
growing
of
roses
.
<EOS>
The
Sergeant
was
so
deeply
interested
that
he
held
up
his
hand
,
and
signed
to
me
not
to
interrupt
the
discussion
,
when
I
came
in
.
<EOS>
As
far
as
I
could
understand
it
,
the
question
between
them
was
,
whether
the
white
moss
rose
did
,
or
did
not
,
require
to
be
budded
on
the
dog
-
rose
to
make
it
grow
well
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Begbie
said
,
Yes
;
and
Sergeant
Cuff
said
,
No
.
<EOS>
They
appealed
to
me
,
as
hotly
as
a
couple
of
boys
.
<EOS>
Knowing
nothing
whatever
about
the
growing
of
roses
,
I
steered
a
middle
course
 
just
as
her
Majesty
's
judges
do
,
when
the
scales
of
justice
bother
them
by
hanging
even
to
a
hair
.
<EOS>
"
Gentlemen
,
"
I
remarked
,
"
there
is
much
to
be
said
on
both
sides
.
"
<EOS>
In
the
temporary
lull
produced
by
that
impartial
sentence
,
I
laid
my
lady
's
written
message
on
the
table
,
under
the
eyes
of
Sergeant
Cuff
.
  
<EOS>
I
had
got
by
this
time
,
as
nearly
as
might
be
,
to
hate
the
Sergeant
.
<EOS>
But
truth
compels
me
to
acknowledge
that
,
in
respect
of
readiness
of
mind
,
he
was
a
wonderful
man
.
  
<EOS>
In
half
a
minute
after
he
had
read
the
message
,
he
had
looked
back
into
his
memory
for
Superintendent
Seegrave
's
report
;
had
picked
out
that
part
of
it
in
which
the
Indians
were
concerned
;
and
was
ready
with
his
answer
.
<EOS>
A
certain
great
traveller
,
who
understood
the
Indians
and
their
language
,
had
figured
in
Mr.
Seegrave
's
report
,
had
n't
he
?
<EOS>
Very
well
.
<EOS>
Did
I
know
the
gentleman
's
name
and
address
?
<EOS>
Very
well
again
.
<EOS>
Would
I
write
them
on
the
back
of
my
lady
's
message
?
<EOS>
Much
obliged
to
me
.
<EOS>
Sergeant
Cuff
would
look
that
gentleman
up
,
when
he
went
to
Frizinghall
in
the
morning
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
expect
anything
to
come
of
it
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
"
<EOS>
Superintendent
Seegrave
found
the
Indians
as
innocent
as
the
babe
unborn
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Superintendent
Seegrave
has
been
proved
wrong
,
up
to
this
time
,
in
all
his
conclusions
,
"
answered
the
Sergeant
.
<EOS>
"
It
may
be
worth
while
to
find
out
to
-
morrow
whether
Superintendent
Seegrave
was
wrong
about
the
Indians
as
well
.
"
<EOS>
With
that
he
turned
to
Mr.
Begbie
,
and
took
up
the
argument
again
exactly
at
the
place
where
it
had
left
off
.
"
<EOS>
This
question
between
us
is
a
question
of
soils
and
seasons
,
and
patience
and
pains
,
Mr.
Gardener
.
<EOS>
Now
let
me
put
it
to
you
from
another
point
of
view
.
<EOS>
You
take
your
white
moss
<EOS>
rose
 
"
  
<EOS>
By
that
time
,
I
had
closed
the
door
on
them
,
and
was
out
of
hearing
of
the
rest
of
the
dispute
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
passage
,
I
met
Penelope
hanging
about
,
and
asked
what
she
was
waiting
for
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
waiting
for
her
young
lady
's
bell
,
when
her
young
lady
chose
to
call
her
back
to
go
on
with
the
packing
for
the
next
day
's
journey
.
<EOS>
Further
inquiry
revealed
to
me
,
that
Miss
Rachel
had
given
it
as
a
reason
for
wanting
to
go
to
her
aunt
at
Frizinghall
,
that
the
house
was
unendurable
to
her
,
and
that
she
could
bear
the
odious
presence
of
a
policeman
under
the
same
roof
with
herself
no
longer
.
<EOS>
On
being
informed
,
half
an
hour
since
,
that
her
departure
would
be
delayed
till
two
in
the
afternoon
,
she
had
flown
into
a
violent
passion
.
<EOS>
My
lady
,
present
at
the
time
,
had
severely
rebuked
her
,
and
then
(
having
apparently
something
to
say
,
which
was
reserved
for
her
daughter
's
private
ear
)
had
sent
Penelope
out
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
My
girl
was
in
wretchedly
low
spirits
about
the
changed
state
of
things
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
"
Nothing
goes
right
,
father
;
nothing
is
like
what
it
used
to
be
.
<EOS>
I
feel
as
if
some
dreadful
misfortune
was
hanging
over
us
all
.
"
  
<EOS>
That
was
my
feeling
too
.
<EOS>
But
I
put
a
good
face
on
it
,
before
my
daughter
.
<EOS>
Miss
Rachel
's
bell
rang
while
we
were
talking
.
<EOS>
Penelope
ran
up
the
back
stairs
to
go
on
with
the
packing
.
<EOS>
I
went
by
the
other
way
to
the
hall
,
to
see
what
the
glass
said
about
the
change
in
the
weather
.
  
<EOS>
Just
as
I
approached
the
swing
-
door
leading
into
the
hall
from
the
servants
'
offices
,
it
was
violently
opened
from
the
other
side
,
and
Rosanna
Spearman
ran
by
me
,
with
a
miserable
look
of
pain
in
her
face
,
and
one
of
her
hands
pressed
hard
over
her
heart
,
as
if
the
pang
was
in
that
quarter
.
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
matter
,
my
girl
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
,
stopping
her
.
"
<EOS>
Are
you
ill
?
"
<EOS>
"
For
God
's
sake
,
do
n't
speak
to
me
,
"
she
answered
,
and
twisted
herself
out
of
my
hands
,
and
ran
on
towards
the
servants
'
staircase
.
<EOS>
I
called
to
the
cook
(
who
was
within
hearing
)
to
look
after
the
poor
girl
.
<EOS>
Two
other
persons
proved
to
be
within
hearing
,
as
well
as
the
cook
.
<EOS>
Sergeant
Cuff
darted
softly
out
of
my
room
,
and
asked
what
was
the
matter
.
<EOS>
I
answered
,
"
Nothing
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Franklin
,
on
the
other
side
,
pulled
open
the
swing
-
door
,
and
beckoning
me
into
the
hall
,
inquired
if
I
had
seen
anything
of
Rosanna
Spearman
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
has
just
passed
me
,
sir
,
with
a
very
disturbed
face
,
and
in
a
very
odd
manner
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
afraid
I
am
innocently
the
cause
of
that
disturbance
,
Betteredge
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
,
sir
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
explain
it
,
"
says
Mr.
Franklin
;
"
but
,
if
the
girl
IS
concerned
in
the
loss
of
the
Diamond
,
I
do
really
believe
she
was
on
the
point
of
confessing
everything
 
to
me
,
of
all
the
people
in
the
world
 
not
two
minutes
since
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Looking
towards
the
swing
-
door
,
as
he
said
those
last
words
,
I
fancied
I
saw
it
opened
a
little
way
from
the
inner
side
.
  
<EOS>
Was
there
anybody
listening
?
<EOS>
The
door
fell
to
,
before
I
could
get
to
it
.
<EOS>
Looking
through
,
the
moment
after
,
I
thought
I
saw
the
tails
of
Sergeant
Cuff
's
respectable
black
coat
disappearing
round
the
corner
of
the
passage
.
<EOS>
He
knew
,
as
well
as
I
did
,
that
he
could
expect
no
more
help
from
me
,
now
that
I
had
discovered
the
turn
which
his
investigations
were
really
taking
.
<EOS>
Under
those
circumstances
,
it
was
quite
in
his
character
to
help
himself
,
and
to
do
it
by
the
underground
way
.
  
<EOS>
Not
feeling
sure
that
I
had
really
seen
the
Sergeant
 
and
not
desiring
to
make
needless
mischief
,
<EOS>
where
,
Heaven
knows
,
there
was
mischief
enough
going
on
already
 
<EOS>
I
told
Mr.
Franklin
that
I
thought
one
of
the
dogs
had
got
into
the
house
 
and
then
begged
him
to
describe
what
had
happened
between
Rosanna
and
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
Were
you
passing
through
the
hall
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
<EOS>
"
Did
you
meet
her
accidentally
,
when
she
spoke
to
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Franklin
pointed
to
the
billiard
-
table
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
knocking
the
balls
about
,
"
he
said
,
"
and
trying
to
get
this
miserable
business
of
the
Diamond
out
of
my
mind
.
<EOS>
I
happened
to
look
up
 
and
there
stood
Rosanna
Spearman
at
the
side
of
me
,
like
a
ghost
!
<EOS>
Her
stealing
on
me
in
that
way
was
so
strange
,
that
I
hardly
knew
what
to
do
at
first
.
<EOS>
Seeing
a
very
anxious
expression
in
her
face
,
I
asked
her
if
she
wished
to
speak
to
me
.
<EOS>
She
answered
,
"
Yes
,
if
I
dare
.
"
<EOS>
Knowing
what
suspicion
attached
to
her
,
I
could
only
put
one
construction
on
such
language
as
that
.
<EOS>
I
confess
it
made
me
uncomfortable
.
<EOS>
I
had
no
wish
to
invite
the
girl
's
confidence
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
,
in
the
difficulties
that
now
beset
us
,
I
could
hardly
feel
justified
in
refusing
to
listen
to
her
,
if
she
was
really
bent
on
speaking
to
me
.
<EOS>
It
was
an
awkward
position
;
and
I
dare
say
I
got
out
of
it
awkwardly
enough
.
<EOS>
I
said
to
her
,
"
I
do
n't
quite
understand
you
.
<EOS>
Is
there
anything
you
want
me
to
do
?
<EOS>
"
Mind
,
Betteredge
,
I
did
n't
speak
unkindly
!
<EOS>
The
poor
girl
ca
n't
help
being
ugly
 
<EOS>
I
felt
that
,
at
the
time
.
<EOS>
The
cue
was
still
in
my
hand
,
and
I
went
on
knocking
the
balls
about
,
to
take
off
the
awkwardness
of
the
thing
.
<EOS>
As
it
turned
out
,
I
only
made
matters
worse
still
.
<EOS>
I
'm
afraid
I
mortified
her
without
meaning
it
!
<EOS>
She
suddenly
turned
away
.
"
<EOS>
He
looks
at
the
billiard
balls
,
"
I
heard
her
say
.
<EOS>
"
Anything
rather
than
look
at
_
me
_
!
<EOS>
"
Before
I
could
stop
her
,
she
had
left
the
hall
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
quite
easy
about
it
,
Betteredge
.
<EOS>
Would
you
mind
telling
Rosanna
that
I
meant
no
unkindness
?
<EOS>
I
have
been
a
little
hard
on
her
,
perhaps
,
in
my
own
thoughts
 
<EOS>
I
have
almost
hoped
that
the
loss
of
the
Diamond
might
be
traced
to
_
her
_
.
<EOS>
Not
from
any
ill
-
will
to
the
poor
girl
:
but
 
"
He
stopped
there
,
and
going
back
to
the
billiard
-
table
,
began
to
knock
the
balls
about
once
more
.
  
<EOS>
After
what
had
passed
between
the
Sergeant
and
me
,
I
knew
what
it
was
that
he
had
left
unspoken
as
well
as
he
knew
it
himself
.
  
<EOS>
Nothing
but
the
tracing
of
the
Moonstone
to
our
second
housemaid
could
now
raise
Miss
Rachel
above
the
infamous
suspicion
that
rested
on
her
in
the
mind
of
Sergeant
Cuff
.
<EOS>
It
was
no
longer
a
question
of
quieting
my
young
lady
's
nervous
excitement
;
it
was
a
question
of
proving
her
innocence
.
<EOS>
If
Rosanna
had
done
nothing
to
compromise
herself
,
the
hope
which
Mr.
Franklin
confessed
to
having
felt
would
have
been
hard
enough
on
her
in
all
conscience
.
<EOS>
But
this
was
not
the
case
.
<EOS>
She
had
pretended
to
be
ill
,
and
had
gone
secretly
to
Frizinghall
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
up
all
night
,
making
something
or
destroying
something
,
in
private
.
<EOS>
And
she
had
been
at
the
Shivering
Sand
,
that
evening
,
under
circumstances
which
were
highly
suspicious
,
to
say
the
least
of
them
.
<EOS>
For
all
these
reasons
(
sorry
as
I
was
for
Rosanna
)
<EOS>
I
could
not
but
think
that
Mr.
Franklin
's
way
of
looking
at
the
matter
was
neither
unnatural
nor
unreasonable
,
in
Mr.
Franklin
's
position
.
<EOS>
I
said
a
word
to
him
to
that
effect
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
yes
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
in
return
.
"
<EOS>
But
there
is
just
a
chance
 
a
very
poor
one
,
certainly
 
that
Rosanna
's
conduct
may
admit
of
some
explanation
which
we
do
n't
see
at
present
.
<EOS>
I
hate
hurting
a
woman
's
feelings
,
Betteredge
!
<EOS>
Tell
the
poor
creature
what
I
told
you
to
tell
her
.
<EOS>
And
if
she
wants
to
speak
to
me
 
I
do
n't
care
whether
I
get
into
a
scrape
or
not
 
<EOS>
send
her
to
me
in
the
library
.
<EOS>
"
With
those
kind
words
he
laid
down
the
cue
and
left
me
.
  
<EOS>
Inquiry
at
the
servants
'
offices
informed
me
that
Rosanna
had
retired
to
her
own
room
.
<EOS>
She
had
declined
all
offers
of
assistance
with
thanks
,
and
had
only
asked
to
be
left
to
rest
in
quiet
.
<EOS>
Here
,
therefore
,
was
an
end
of
any
confession
on
her
part
(
supposing
she
really
had
a
confession
to
make
)
for
that
night
.
<EOS>
I
reported
the
result
to
Mr.
Franklin
,
who
,
thereupon
,
left
the
library
,
and
went
up
to
bed
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
putting
the
lights
out
,
and
making
the
windows
fast
,
when
Samuel
came
in
with
news
of
the
two
guests
whom
I
had
left
in
my
room
.
  
<EOS>
The
argument
about
the
white
moss
rose
<EOS>
had
apparently
come
to
an
end
at
last
.
<EOS>
The
gardener
had
gone
home
,
and
Sergeant
Cuff
was
nowhere
to
be
found
in
the
lower
regions
of
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
I
looked
into
my
room
.
<EOS>
Quite
true
 
nothing
was
to
be
discovered
there
but
a
couple
of
empty
tumblers
and
a
strong
smell
of
hot
grog
.
<EOS>
Had
the
Sergeant
gone
of
his
own
accord
to
the
bed
-
chamber
that
was
prepared
for
him
?
<EOS>
I
went
up
-
stairs
to
see
.
  
<EOS>
After
reaching
the
second
landing
,
I
thought
I
heard
a
sound
of
quiet
and
regular
breathing
on
my
left
-
hand
side
.
<EOS>
My
left
-
hand
side
led
to
the
corridor
which
communicated
with
Miss
Rachel
's
room
.
<EOS>
I
looked
in
,
and
there
,
coiled
up
on
three
chairs
placed
right
across
the
passage
 
there
,
with
a
red
handkerchief
tied
round
his
grizzled
head
,
and
his
respectable
black
coat
rolled
up
for
a
pillow
,
lay
and
slept
Sergeant
Cuff
!
  
<EOS>
He
woke
,
instantly
and
quietly
,
like
a
dog
,
the
moment
I
approached
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Good
night
,
Mr.
Betteredge
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
And
mind
,
if
you
ever
take
to
growing
roses
,
the
white
moss
rose
is
all
the
better
for
not
being
budded
on
the
dog
-
rose
,
whatever
the
gardener
may
say
to
the
contrary
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
are
you
doing
here
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
<EOS>
"
Why
are
you
not
in
your
proper
bed
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
in
my
proper
bed
,
"
answered
the
Sergeant
,
"
because
I
am
one
of
the
many
people
in
this
miserable
world
who
ca
n't
earn
their
money
honestly
and
easily
at
the
same
time
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
coincidence
,
this
evening
,
between
the
period
of
Rosanna
Spearman
's
return
from
the
Sands
and
the
period
when
Miss
Verinder
stated
her
resolution
to
leave
the
house
.
<EOS>
Whatever
Rosanna
may
have
hidden
,
it
's
clear
to
my
mind
that
your
young
lady
could
n't
go
away
until
she
knew
that
it
WAS
hidden
.
<EOS>
The
two
must
have
communicated
privately
once
already
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
If
they
try
to
communicate
again
,
when
the
house
is
quiet
,
I
want
to
be
in
the
way
,
and
stop
it
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
blame
me
for
upsetting
your
sleeping
arrangements
,
Mr.
Betteredge
 
blame
the
Diamond
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
to
God
the
Diamond
had
never
found
its
way
into
this
house
!
<EOS>
"
I
broke
out
.
  
<EOS>
Sergeant
Cuff
looked
with
a
rueful
face
at
the
three
chairs
on
which
he
had
condemned
himself
to
pass
the
night
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
do
I
,
"
he
said
,
gravely
.
    
<EOS>
Nothing
happened
in
the
night
;
and
(
I
am
happy
to
add
)
<EOS>
no
attempt
at
communication
between
Miss
Rachel
and
Rosanna
rewarded
the
vigilance
of
Sergeant
Cuff
.
  
<EOS>
I
had
expected
the
Sergeant
to
set
off
for
Frizinghall
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
He
waited
about
,
however
,
as
if
he
had
something
else
to
do
first
.
<EOS>
I
left
him
to
his
own
devices
;
and
going
into
the
grounds
shortly
after
,
met
Mr.
Franklin
on
his
favourite
walk
by
the
shrubbery
side
.
  
<EOS>
Before
we
had
exchanged
two
words
,
the
Sergeant
unexpectedly
joined
us
.
<EOS>
He
made
up
to
Mr.
Franklin
,
who
received
him
,
I
must
own
,
haughtily
enough
.
"
<EOS>
Have
you
anything
to
say
to
me
?
"
was
all
the
return
he
got
for
politely
wishing
Mr.
Franklin
good
morning
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
something
to
say
to
you
,
sir
,
"
answered
the
Sergeant
,
"
on
the
subject
of
the
inquiry
I
am
conducting
here
.
<EOS>
You
detected
the
turn
that
inquiry
was
really
taking
,
yesterday
.
<EOS>
Naturally
enough
,
in
your
position
,
you
are
shocked
and
distressed
.
<EOS>
Naturally
enough
,
also
,
you
visit
your
own
angry
sense
of
your
own
family
scandal
upon
Me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
want
?
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Franklin
broke
in
,
sharply
enough
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
remind
you
,
sir
,
that
I
have
at
any
rate
,
thus
far
,
not
been
PROVED
to
be
wrong
.
<EOS>
Bearing
that
in
mind
,
be
pleased
to
remember
,
at
the
same
time
,
that
I
am
an
officer
of
the
law
acting
here
under
the
sanction
of
the
mistress
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
Under
these
circumstances
,
is
it
,
or
is
it
not
,
your
duty
as
a
good
citizen
,
to
assist
me
with
any
special
information
which
you
may
happen
to
possess
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
possess
no
special
information
,
"
says
Mr.
Franklin
.
  
<EOS>
Sergeant
Cuff
put
that
answer
by
him
,
as
if
no
answer
had
been
made
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
may
save
my
time
,
sir
,
from
being
wasted
on
an
inquiry
at
a
distance
,
"
he
went
on
,
"
if
you
choose
to
understand
me
and
speak
out
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
understand
you
,
"
answered
Mr.
Franklin
;
"
and
I
have
nothing
to
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
One
of
the
female
servants
(
I
wo
n't
mention
names
)
spoke
to
you
privately
,
sir
,
last
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Once
more
Mr.
Franklin
cut
him
short
;
once
more
Mr.
Franklin
answered
,
"
I
have
nothing
to
say
.
"
  
<EOS>
Standing
by
in
silence
,
I
thought
of
the
movement
in
the
swing
-
door
on
the
previous
evening
,
and
of
the
coat
-
tails
which
I
had
seen
disappearing
down
the
passage
.
<EOS>
Sergeant
Cuff
had
,
no
doubt
,
just
heard
enough
,
before
I
interrupted
him
,
to
make
him
suspect
that
Rosanna
had
relieved
her
mind
by
confessing
something
to
Mr.
Franklin
Blake
.
  
<EOS>
This
notion
had
barely
struck
me
 
when
who
should
appear
at
the
end
of
the
shrubbery
walk
but
Rosanna
Spearman
in
her
own
proper
person
!
<EOS>
She
was
followed
by
Penelope
,
who
was
evidently
trying
to
make
her
retrace
her
steps
to
the
house
.
<EOS>
Seeing
that
Mr.
Franklin
was
not
alone
,
Rosanna
came
to
a
standstill
,
evidently
in
great
perplexity
what
to
do
next
.
<EOS>
Penelope
waited
behind
her
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Franklin
saw
the
girls
as
soon
as
I
saw
them
.
<EOS>
The
Sergeant
,
with
his
devilish
cunning
,
took
on
not
to
have
noticed
them
at
all
.
<EOS>
All
this
happened
in
an
instant
.
<EOS>
Before
either
Mr.
Franklin
or
I
could
say
a
word
,
Sergeant
Cuff
struck
in
smoothly
,
with
an
appearance
of
continuing
the
previous
conversation
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
need
n't
be
afraid
of
harming
the
girl
,
sir
,
"
he
said
to
Mr.
Franklin
,
speaking
in
a
loud
voice
,
so
that
Rosanna
might
hear
him
.
"
<EOS>
On
the
contrary
,
I
recommend
you
to
honour
me
with
your
confidence
,
if
you
feel
any
interest
in
Rosanna
Spearman
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Franklin
instantly
took
on
not
to
have
noticed
the
girls
either
.
<EOS>
He
answered
,
speaking
loudly
on
his
side
:
  
<EOS>
"
I
take
no
interest
<EOS>
whatever
in
Rosanna
Spearman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
looked
towards
the
end
of
the
walk
.
<EOS>
All
I
saw
at
the
distance
was
that
Rosanna
suddenly
turned
round
,
the
moment
Mr.
Franklin
had
spoken
.
<EOS>
Instead
of
resisting
Penelope
,
as
she
had
done
the
moment
before
,
she
now
let
my
daughter
take
her
by
the
arm
and
lead
her
back
to
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
The
breakfast
-
bell
rang
as
the
two
girls
disappeared
 
and
even
Sergeant
Cuff
was
now
obliged
to
give
it
up
as
a
bad
job
!
<EOS>
He
said
to
me
quietly
,
"
I
shall
go
to
Frizinghall
,
Mr.
Betteredge
;
and
I
shall
be
back
before
two
.
"
<EOS>
He
went
his
way
without
a
word
more
 
and
for
some
few
hours
we
were
well
rid
of
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
make
it
right
with
Rosanna
,
"
Mr.
Franklin
said
to
me
,
when
we
were
alone
.
<EOS>
"
I
seem
to
be
fated
to
say
or
do
something
awkward
,
before
that
unlucky
girl
.
<EOS>
You
must
have
seen
yourself
that
Sergeant
Cuff
laid
a
trap
for
both
of
us
.
<EOS>
If
he
could
confuse
ME
,
or
irritate
HER
into
breaking
out
,
either
she
or
I
might
have
said
something
which
would
answer
his
purpose
.
<EOS>
On
the
spur
of
the
moment
,
I
saw
no
better
way
out
of
it
than
the
way
I
took
.
<EOS>
It
stopped
the
girl
from
saying
anything
,
and
it
showed
the
Sergeant
that
I
saw
through
him
.
<EOS>
He
was
evidently
listening
,
Betteredge
,
when
I
was
speaking
to
you
last
night
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
had
done
worse
than
listen
,
as
I
privately
thought
to
myself
.
<EOS>
He
had
remembered
my
telling
him
that
the
girl
was
in
love
with
Mr.
Franklin
;
and
he
had
calculated
on
THAT
,
when
he
appealed
to
Mr.
Franklin
's
interest
in
Rosanna
 
in
Rosanna
's
hearing
.
  
<EOS>
"
As
to
listening
,
sir
,
"
I
remarked
(
keeping
the
other
point
to
myself
)
,
"
we
shall
all
be
rowing
in
the
same
boat
if
this
sort
of
thing
goes
on
much
longer
.
<EOS>
Prying
,
and
peeping
,
and
listening
are
the
natural
occupations
of
people
situated
as
we
are
.
<EOS>
In
another
day
or
two
,
Mr.
Franklin
,
we
shall
all
be
struck
dumb
together
 
for
this
reason
,
that
we
shall
all
be
listening
to
surprise
each
other
's
secrets
,
and
all
know
it
.
<EOS>
Excuse
my
breaking
out
,
sir
.
<EOS>
The
horrid
mystery
hanging
over
us
in
this
house
gets
into
my
head
like
liquor
,
and
makes
me
wild
.
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
forget
what
you
have
told
me
.
<EOS>
I
'll
take
the
first
opportunity
of
making
it
right
with
Rosanna
Spearman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
n't
said
anything
to
her
yet
about
last
night
,
have
you
?
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Franklin
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
say
nothing
now
.
<EOS>
I
had
better
not
invite
the
girl
's
confidence
,
with
the
Sergeant
on
the
look
-
out
to
surprise
us
together
.
<EOS>
My
conduct
is
not
very
consistent
<EOS>
,
Betteredge
 
is
it
?
<EOS>
I
see
no
way
out
of
this
business
,
which
is
n't
dreadful
to
think
of
,
unless
the
Diamond
is
traced
to
Rosanna
.
<EOS>
And
yet
I
ca
n't
,
and
wo
n't
,
help
Sergeant
Cuff
to
find
the
girl
out
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Unreasonable
enough
,
no
doubt
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
my
state
of
mind
as
well
.
<EOS>
I
thoroughly
understood
him
.
<EOS>
If
you
will
,
for
once
in
your
life
,
remember
that
you
are
mortal
,
perhaps
you
will
thoroughly
understand
him
too
.
  
<EOS>
The
state
of
things
,
indoors
and
out
,
while
Sergeant
Cuff
was
on
his
way
to
Frizinghall
,
was
briefly
this
:
  
<EOS>
Miss
Rachel
waited
for
the
time
when
the
carriage
was
to
take
her
to
her
aunt
's
,
still
obstinately
shut
up
in
her
own
room
.
<EOS>
My
lady
and
Mr.
Franklin
breakfasted
together
.
<EOS>
After
breakfast
,
Mr.
Franklin
took
one
of
his
sudden
resolutions
,
and
went
out
precipitately
to
quiet
his
mind
by
a
long
walk
.
<EOS>
I
was
the
only
person
who
saw
him
go
;
and
he
told
me
he
should
be
back
before
the
Sergeant
returned
.
<EOS>
The
change
in
the
weather
,
foreshadowed
overnight
,
had
come
.
<EOS>
Heavy
rain
had
been
followed
soon
after
dawn
,
by
high
wind
.
<EOS>
It
was
blowing
fresh
,
as
the
day
got
on
.
<EOS>
But
though
the
clouds
threatened
more
than
once
,
the
rain
still
held
off
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
a
bad
day
for
a
walk
,
if
you
were
young
and
strong
,
and
could
breast
the
great
gusts
of
wind
which
came
sweeping
in
from
the
sea
.
  
<EOS>
I
attended
my
lady
after
breakfast
,
and
assisted
her
in
the
settlement
of
our
household
accounts
.
<EOS>
She
only
once
alluded
to
the
matter
of
the
Moonstone
,
and
that
was
in
the
way
of
forbidding
any
present
mention
of
it
between
us
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Wait
till
that
man
comes
back
,
"
she
said
,
meaning
the
Sergeant
.
<EOS>
"
We
MUST
speak
of
it
then
:
we
are
not
obliged
to
speak
of
it
now
.
"
  
<EOS>
After
leaving
my
mistress
,
I
found
Penelope
waiting
for
me
in
my
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
,
father
,
you
would
come
and
speak
to
Rosanna
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
uneasy
about
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
suspected
what
was
the
matter
readily
enough
.
<EOS>
But
it
is
a
maxim
of
mine
that
men
(
being
superior
creatures
)
are
bound
to
improve
women
 
if
they
can
.
<EOS>
When
a
woman
wants
me
to
do
anything
(
my
daughter
,
or
not
,
it
does
n't
matter
)
,
I
always
insist
on
knowing
why
.
<EOS>
The
oftener
you
make
them
rummage
their
own
minds
for
a
reason
,
the
more
manageable
you
will
find
them
in
all
the
relations
of
life
.
<EOS>
It
is
n't
their
fault
(
poor
wretches
!
)
<EOS>
that
they
act
first
and
think
afterwards
;
it
's
the
fault
of
the
fools
who
humour
them
.
  
<EOS>
Penelope
's
reason
why
,
on
this
occasion
,
may
be
given
in
her
own
words
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
afraid
,
father
,
"
she
said
,
"
Mr.
Franklin
has
hurt
Rosanna
cruelly
,
without
intending
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
took
Rosanna
into
the
shrubbery
walk
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
Her
own
madness
,
"
says
Penelope
;
"
I
can
call
it
nothing
else
.
<EOS>
She
was
bent
on
speaking
to
Mr.
Franklin
,
this
morning
,
come
what
might
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
did
my
best
to
stop
her
;
you
saw
that
.
<EOS>
If
I
could
only
have
got
her
away
before
she
heard
those
dreadful
words
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
There
!
<EOS>
there
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I
said
,
"
do
n't
lose
your
head
.
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
call
to
mind
that
anything
happened
to
alarm
Rosanna
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nothing
to
alarm
her
,
father
.
<EOS>
But
Mr.
Franklin
said
he
took
no
interest
whatever
in
her
 
<EOS>
and
,
oh
,
he
said
it
in
such
a
cruel
voice
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
said
it
to
stop
the
Sergeant
's
mouth
,
"
I
answered
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
told
her
that
,
"
says
Penelope
.
<EOS>
"
But
you
see
,
father
(
though
Mr.
Franklin
is
n't
to
blame
)
,
he
's
been
mortifying
and
disappointing
her
for
weeks
and
weeks
past
;
and
now
this
comes
on
the
top
of
it
all
!
<EOS>
She
has
no
right
,
of
course
,
to
expect
him
to
take
any
interest
in
her
.
<EOS>
It
's
quite
monstrous
that
she
should
forget
herself
and
her
station
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
But
she
seems
to
have
lost
pride
,
and
proper
feeling
,
and
everything
.
<EOS>
She
frightened
me
,
father
,
when
Mr.
Franklin
said
those
words
.
<EOS>
They
seemed
to
turn
her
into
stone
.
<EOS>
A
sudden
quiet
came
over
her
,
and
she
has
gone
about
her
work
,
ever
since
,
like
a
woman
in
a
dream
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
began
to
feel
a
little
uneasy
.
<EOS>
There
was
something
in
the
way
Penelope
put
it
which
silenced
my
superior
sense
.
<EOS>
I
called
to
mind
,
now
my
thoughts
were
directed
that
way
,
what
had
passed
between
Mr.
Franklin
and
Rosanna
overnight
.
<EOS>
She
looked
cut
to
the
heart
on
that
occasion
;
and
now
,
as
ill
-
luck
would
have
it
,
she
had
been
unavoidably
stung
again
,
poor
soul
,
on
the
tender
place
.
<EOS>
Sad
!
<EOS>
sad
!
 
<EOS>
all
the
more
sad
because
the
girl
had
no
reason
to
justify
her
,
and
no
right
to
feel
it
.
  
<EOS>
I
had
promised
Mr.
Franklin
to
speak
to
Rosanna
,
and
this
seemed
the
fittest
time
for
keeping
my
word
.
  
<EOS>
We
found
the
girl
sweeping
the
corridor
outside
the
bedrooms
,
pale
and
composed
,
and
neat
as
ever
in
her
modest
print
dress
.
<EOS>
I
noticed
a
curious
dimness
and
dullness
in
her
eyes
 
not
as
if
she
had
been
crying
but
as
if
she
had
been
looking
at
something
too
long
.
<EOS>
Possibly
,
it
was
a
misty
something
raised
by
her
own
thoughts
.
<EOS>
There
was
certainly
no
object
about
her
to
look
at
which
she
had
not
seen
already
hundreds
on
hundreds
of
times
.
  
<EOS>
"
Cheer
up
,
Rosanna
!
<EOS>
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
n't
fret
over
your
own
fancies
.
<EOS>
I
have
got
something
to
say
to
you
from
Mr.
Franklin
.
<EOS>
"
  
I
thereupon
put
the
matter
in
the
right
view
before
her
,
in
the
friendliest
and
most
comforting
words
I
could
find
.
<EOS>
My
principles
,
in
regard
to
the
other
sex
,
are
,
as
you
may
have
noticed
,
very
severe
.
<EOS>
But
somehow
or
other
,
when
I
come
face
to
face
with
the
women
,
my
practice
(
I
own
)
is
not
conformable
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Franklin
is
very
kind
and
considerate
.
<EOS>
Please
to
thank
him
.
<EOS>
"
That
was
all
the
answer
she
made
me
.
  
<EOS>
My
daughter
had
already
noticed
that
Rosanna
went
about
her
work
like
a
woman
in
a
dream
.
<EOS>
I
now
added
to
this
observation
,
that
she
also
listened
and
spoke
like
a
woman
in
a
dream
.
<EOS>
I
doubted
if
her
mind
was
in
a
fit
condition
to
take
in
what
I
had
said
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
quite
sure
,
Rosanna
,
that
you
understand
me
?
"
I
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
Quite
sure
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
echoed
me
,
not
like
a
living
woman
,
but
like
a
creature
moved
by
machinery
.
<EOS>
She
went
on
sweeping
all
the
time
.
<EOS>
I
took
away
the
broom
as
gently
and
as
kindly
as
I
could
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
,
come
,
my
girl
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I
said
,
"
this
is
not
like
yourself
.
<EOS>
You
have
got
something
on
your
mind
.
<EOS>
I
'm
your
friend
 
<EOS>
and
I
'll
stand
your
friend
,
even
if
you
have
done
wrong
.
<EOS>
Make
a
clean
breast
of
it
,
Rosanna
 
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
time
had
been
,
when
my
speaking
to
her
in
that
way
would
have
brought
the
tears
into
her
eyes
.
<EOS>
I
could
see
no
change
in
them
now
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
she
said
,
"
I
'll
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
To
my
lady
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
To
Mr.
Franklin
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Yes
;
to
Mr.
Franklin
.
<EOS>
"
  
I
hardly
knew
what
to
say
to
that
.
<EOS>
She
was
in
no
condition
to
understand
the
caution
against
speaking
to
him
in
private
,
which
Mr.
Franklin
had
directed
me
to
give
her
.
<EOS>
Feeling
my
way
,
little
by
little
,
I
only
told
her
Mr.
Franklin
had
gone
out
for
a
walk
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
does
n't
matter
,
"
she
answered
.
<EOS>
"
I
sha
n't
trouble
Mr.
Franklin
,
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
not
speak
to
my
lady
?
<EOS>
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
The
way
to
relieve
your
mind
is
to
speak
to
the
merciful
and
Christian
mistress
who
has
always
been
kind
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
looked
at
me
for
a
moment
with
a
grave
and
steady
attention
,
as
if
she
was
fixing
what
I
said
in
her
mind
.
<EOS>
Then
she
took
the
broom
out
of
my
hands
and
moved
off
with
it
slowly
,
a
little
way
down
the
corridor
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
she
said
,
going
on
with
her
sweeping
,
and
speaking
to
herself
;
"
I
know
a
better
way
of
relieving
my
mind
than
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Please
to
let
me
go
on
with
my
work
.
"
  
<EOS>
Penelope
followed
her
,
and
offered
to
help
her
.
  
<EOS>
She
answered
,
"
No
.
<EOS>
I
want
to
do
my
work
.
<EOS>
Thank
you
,
Penelope
.
"
<EOS>
She
looked
round
at
me
.
"
<EOS>
Thank
you
,
Mr.
Betteredge
.
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
no
moving
her
 
<EOS>
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
said
.
<EOS>
I
signed
to
Penelope
to
come
away
with
me
.
<EOS>
We
left
her
,
as
we
had
found
her
,
sweeping
the
corridor
,
like
a
woman
in
a
dream
.
  
<EOS>
"
This
is
a
matter
for
the
doctor
to
look
into
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
beyond
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
My
daughter
reminded
me
of
Mr.
Candy
's
illness
,
owing
(
as
you
may
remember
)
to
the
chill
he
had
caught
on
the
night
of
the
dinner
-
party
.
<EOS>
His
assistant
 
a
certain
Mr.
Ezra
Jennings
 
was
at
our
disposal
,
to
be
sure
.
<EOS>
But
nobody
knew
much
about
him
in
our
parts
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
engaged
by
Mr.
Candy
under
rather
peculiar
circumstances
;
and
,
right
or
wrong
,
we
none
of
us
liked
him
or
trusted
him
.
<EOS>
There
were
other
doctors
at
Frizinghall
.
<EOS>
But
they
were
strangers
to
our
house
;
and
Penelope
doubted
,
in
Rosanna
's
present
state
,
whether
strangers
might
not
do
her
more
harm
than
good
.
  
<EOS>
I
thought
of
speaking
to
my
lady
.
<EOS>
But
,
remembering
the
heavy
weight
of
anxiety
which
she
already
had
on
her
mind
,
I
hesitated
to
add
to
all
the
other
vexations
this
new
trouble
.
<EOS>
Still
,
there
was
a
necessity
for
doing
something
.
<EOS>
The
girl
's
state
was
,
to
my
thinking
,
downright
alarming
 
and
<EOS>
my
mistress
ought
to
be
informed
of
it
.
<EOS>
Unwilling
enough
,
I
went
to
her
sitting
-
room
.
<EOS>
No
one
was
there
.
<EOS>
My
lady
was
shut
up
with
Miss
Rachel
.
<EOS>
It
was
impossible
for
me
to
see
her
till
she
came
out
again
.
  
<EOS>
I
waited
in
vain
till
the
clock
on
the
front
staircase
struck
the
quarter
to
two
.
<EOS>
Five
minutes
afterwards
,
I
heard
my
name
called
,
from
the
drive
outside
the
house
.
<EOS>
I
knew
the
voice
directly
.
<EOS>
Sergeant
Cuff
had
returned
from
Frizinghall
.
    
<EOS>
Going
down
to
the
front
door
,
I
met
the
Sergeant
on
the
steps
.
  
<EOS>
It
went
against
the
grain
with
me
,
after
what
had
passed
between
us
,
to
show
him
that
I
felt
any
sort
of
interest
in
his
proceedings
.
<EOS>
In
spite
of
myself
,
however
,
I
felt
an
interest
that
there
was
no
resisting
.
<EOS>
My
sense
of
dignity
sank
from
under
me
,
and
out
came
the
words
:
"
<EOS>
What
news
from
Frizinghall
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
seen
the
Indians
,
"
answered
Sergeant
Cuff
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
I
have
found
out
what
Rosanna
bought
privately
in
the
town
,
on
Thursday
last
.
<EOS>
The
Indians
will
be
set
free
on
Wednesday
in
next
week
.
<EOS>
There
is
n't
a
doubt
on
my
mind
,
and
there
is
n't
a
doubt
on
Mr.
Murthwaite
's
mind
,
that
they
came
to
this
place
to
steal
the
Moonstone
.
<EOS>
Their
calculations
were
all
thrown
out
,
of
course
,
by
what
happened
in
the
house
on
Wednesday
night
;
and
they
have
no
more
to
do
with
the
actual
loss
of
the
jewel
than
you
have
.
<EOS>
But
I
can
tell
you
one
thing
,
Mr.
Betteredge
 
if
WE
do
n't
find
the
Moonstone
,
THEY
will
.
<EOS>
You
have
not
heard
the
last
of
the
three
jugglers
yet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Franklin
came
back
from
his
walk
as
the
Sergeant
said
those
startling
words
.
<EOS>
Governing
his
curiosity
better
than
I
had
governed
mine
,
he
passed
us
without
a
word
,
and
went
on
into
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
As
for
me
,
having
already
dropped
my
dignity
,
I
determined
to
have
the
whole
benefit
of
the
sacrifice
.
"
<EOS>
So
much
for
the
Indians
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
What
about
Rosanna
next
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Sergeant
Cuff
shook
his
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
mystery
in
that
quarter
is
thicker
than
ever
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
traced
her
to
a
shop
at
Frizinghall
,
kept
by
a
linen
draper
named
Maltby
.
<EOS>
She
bought
nothing
whatever
at
any
of
the
other
drapers
'
shops
,
or
at
any
milliners
'
or
tailors
'
shops
;
and
she
bought
nothing
at
Maltby
's
but
a
piece
of
long
cloth
.
<EOS>
She
was
very
particular
in
choosing
a
certain
quality
.
<EOS>
As
to
quantity
,
she
bought
enough
to
make
a
nightgown
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Whose
nightgown
?
"
I
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
Her
own
,
to
be
sure
.
<EOS>
Between
twelve
and
three
,
on
the
Thursday
morning
,
she
must
have
slipped
down
to
your
young
lady
's
room
,
to
settle
the
hiding
of
the
Moonstone
while
all
the
rest
of
you
were
in
bed
.
<EOS>
In
going
back
to
her
own
room
,
her
nightgown
must
have
brushed
the
wet
paint
on
the
door
.
<EOS>
She
could
n't
wash
out
the
stain
;
and
she
could
n't
safely
destroy
the
night
-
gown
without
first
providing
another
like
it
,
to
make
the
inventory
of
her
linen
complete
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
proves
that
it
was
Rosanna
's
nightgown
?
<EOS>
"
I
objected
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
material
she
bought
for
making
the
substitute
dress
,
"
answered
the
Sergeant
.
<EOS>
"
If
it
had
been
Miss
Verinder
's
nightgown
,
she
would
have
had
to
buy
lace
,
and
frilling
,
and
Lord
knows
what
besides
;
and
she
would
n't
have
had
time
to
make
it
in
one
night
.
<EOS>
Plain
long
cloth
means
a
plain
servant
's
nightgown
.
<EOS>
No
,
no
,
<EOS>
Mr.
Betteredge
 
all
that
is
clear
enough
.
<EOS>
The
pinch
of
the
question
is
 
why
,
after
having
provided
the
substitute
dress
,
does
she
hide
the
smeared
nightgown
,
instead
of
destroying
it
?
<EOS>
If
the
girl
wo
n't
speak
out
,
there
is
only
one
way
of
settling
the
difficulty
.
<EOS>
The
hiding
-
place
at
the
Shivering
Sand
must
be
searched
 
and
the
true
state
of
the
case
will
be
discovered
there
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
are
you
to
find
the
place
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquired
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
to
disappoint
you
,
"
said
the
Sergeant
 
"
<EOS>
but
that
's
a
secret
which
I
mean
to
keep
to
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
(
Not
to
irritate
your
curiosity
,
as
he
irritated
mine
,
I
may
here
inform
you
that
he
had
come
back
from
Frizinghall
provided
with
a
search
-
warrant
.
<EOS>
His
experience
in
such
matters
told
him
that
Rosanna
was
in
all
probability
carrying
about
her
a
memorandum
of
the
hiding
-
place
,
to
guide
her
,
<EOS>
in
case
she
returned
to
it
,
under
changed
circumstances
and
after
a
lapse
of
time
.
<EOS>
Possessed
of
this
memorandum
,
the
Sergeant
would
be
furnished
with
all
that
he
could
desire
.
)
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
Mr.
Betteredge
,
"
he
went
on
,
"
suppose
we
drop
speculation
,
and
get
to
business
.
<EOS>
I
told
Joyce
to
have
an
eye
on
Rosanna
.
<EOS>
Where
is
Joyce
?
"
  
<EOS>
Joyce
was
the
Frizinghall
policeman
,
who
had
been
left
by
Superintendent
Seegrave
at
Sergeant
Cuff
's
disposal
.
<EOS>
The
clock
struck
two
,
as
he
put
the
question
;
and
,
punctual
to
the
moment
,
the
carriage
came
round
to
take
Miss
Rachel
to
her
aunt
's
.
  
<EOS>
"
One
thing
at
a
time
,
"
said
the
Sergeant
,
stopping
me
as
I
was
about
to
send
in
search
of
Joyce
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
attend
to
Miss
Verinder
first
.
"
  
<EOS>
As
the
rain
was
still
threatening
,
it
was
the
close
carriage
that
had
been
appointed
to
take
Miss
Rachel
to
Frizinghall
.
<EOS>
Sergeant
Cuff
beckoned
Samuel
to
come
down
to
him
from
the
rumble
behind
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
see
a
friend
of
mine
waiting
among
the
trees
,
on
this
side
of
the
lodge
gate
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
My
friend
,
without
stopping
the
carriage
,
will
get
up
into
the
rumble
with
you
.
<EOS>
You
have
nothing
to
do
but
to
hold
your
tongue
,
and
shut
your
eyes
.
<EOS>
Otherwise
,
you
will
get
into
trouble
.
"
  
<EOS>
With
that
advice
,
he
sent
the
footman
back
to
his
place
.
<EOS>
What
Samuel
thought
I
do
n't
know
.
<EOS>
It
was
plain
,
to
my
mind
,
that
Miss
Rachel
was
to
be
privately
kept
in
view
from
the
time
when
she
left
our
house
 
if
she
did
leave
it
.
<EOS>
A
watch
set
on
my
young
lady
!
<EOS>
A
spy
behind
her
in
the
rumble
of
her
mother
's
carriage
!
<EOS>
I
could
have
cut
my
own
tongue
out
for
having
forgotten
myself
so
far
as
to
speak
to
Sergeant
Cuff
.
  
<EOS>
The
first
person
to
come
out
of
the
house
was
my
lady
.
<EOS>
She
stood
aside
,
on
the
top
step
,
posting
herself
there
to
see
what
happened
.
<EOS>
Not
a
word
did
she
say
,
either
to
the
Sergeant
or
to
me
.
<EOS>
With
her
lips
closed
,
and
her
arms
folded
in
the
light
garden
cloak
which
she
had
wrapped
round
her
on
coming
into
the
air
,
there
she
stood
,
as
still
as
a
statue
,
waiting
for
her
daughter
to
appear
.
  
<EOS>
In
a
minute
more
,
Miss
Rachel
came
downstairs
 
very
nicely
dressed
in
some
soft
yellow
stuff
,
that
set
off
her
dark
complexion
,
and
clipped
her
tight
(
in
the
form
of
a
jacket
)
round
the
waist
.
<EOS>
She
had
a
smart
little
straw
hat
on
her
head
,
with
a
white
veil
twisted
round
it
.
<EOS>
She
had
primrose
-
coloured
gloves
that
fitted
her
hands
like
a
second
skin
.
<EOS>
Her
beautiful
black
hair
looked
as
smooth
as
satin
under
her
hat
.
<EOS>
Her
little
ears
were
like
rosy
shells
 
<EOS>
they
had
a
pearl
dangling
from
each
of
them
.
<EOS>
She
came
swiftly
out
to
us
,
as
straight
as
a
lily
on
its
stem
,
and
as
lithe
and
supple
in
every
movement
she
made
as
a
young
cat
.
<EOS>
Nothing
that
I
could
discover
was
altered
in
her
pretty
face
,
but
her
eyes
and
her
lips
.
<EOS>
Her
eyes
were
brighter
and
fiercer
than
I
liked
to
see
;
and
her
lips
had
so
completely
lost
their
colour
and
their
smile
that
I
hardly
knew
them
again
.
<EOS>
She
kissed
her
mother
in
a
hasty
and
sudden
manner
on
the
cheek
.
<EOS>
She
said
,
"
Try
to
forgive
me
,
mamma
"
 
and
then
pulled
down
her
veil
over
her
face
so
vehemently
that
she
tore
it
.
<EOS>
In
another
moment
she
had
run
down
the
steps
,
and
had
rushed
into
the
carriage
as
if
it
was
a
hiding
-
place
.
  
<EOS>
Sergeant
Cuff
was
just
as
quick
on
his
side
.
<EOS>
He
put
Samuel
back
,
and
stood
before
Miss
Rachel
,
with
the
open
carriage
-
door
in
his
hand
,
at
the
instant
when
she
settled
herself
in
her
place
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
want
?
"
says
Miss
Rachel
,
from
behind
her
veil
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
say
one
word
to
you
,
miss
,
"
answered
the
Sergeant
,
"
before
you
go
.
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
presume
to
stop
your
paying
a
visit
to
your
aunt
.
<EOS>
I
can
only
venture
to
say
that
your
leaving
us
,
as
things
are
now
,
puts
an
obstacle
in
the
way
of
my
recovering
your
Diamond
.
<EOS>
Please
to
understand
that
;
and
now
decide
for
yourself
whether
you
go
or
stay
.
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Rachel
never
even
answered
him
.
"
<EOS>
Drive
on
,
James
!
"
<EOS>
she
called
out
to
the
coachman
.
  
<EOS>
Without
another
word
,
the
Sergeant
shut
the
carriage
-
door
.
<EOS>
Just
as
he
closed
it
,
Mr.
Franklin
came
running
down
the
steps
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Good
-
bye
,
Rachel
<EOS>
,
"
he
said
,
holding
out
his
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
Drive
on
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Miss
Rachel
,
louder
than
ever
,
and
taking
no
more
notice
of
Mr.
Franklin
than
she
had
taken
of
Sergeant
Cuff
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Franklin
stepped
back
thunderstruck
,
as
well
he
might
be
.
<EOS>
The
coachman
,
not
knowing
what
to
do
,
looked
towards
my
lady
,
still
standing
immovable
on
the
top
step
.
<EOS>
My
lady
,
with
anger
and
sorrow
and
shame
all
struggling
together
in
her
face
,
made
him
a
sign
to
start
the
horses
,
and
then
turned
back
hastily
into
the
house
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Franklin
,
recovering
the
use
of
his
speech
,
called
after
her
,
as
the
carriage
drove
off
,
"
Aunt
!
<EOS>
you
were
quite
right
.
<EOS>
Accept
my
thanks
for
all
your
kindness
 
and
let
me
go
.
"
  
<EOS>
My
lady
turned
as
though
to
speak
to
him
.
<EOS>
Then
,
as
if
distrusting
herself
,
waved
her
hand
kindly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Let
me
see
you
,
before
you
leave
us
,
Franklin
,
"
she
said
,
in
a
broken
voice
 
and
went
on
to
her
own
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
me
a
last
favour
,
Betteredge
,
"
says
Mr.
Franklin
,
turning
to
me
,
with
the
tears
in
his
eyes
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Get
me
away
to
the
train
as
soon
as
you
can
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
too
went
his
way
into
the
house
.
<EOS>
For
the
moment
,
Miss
Rachel
had
completely
unmanned
him
.
<EOS>
Judge
from
that
,
how
fond
he
must
have
been
of
her
!
  
<EOS>
Sergeant
Cuff
and
I
were
left
face
to
face
,
at
the
bottom
of
the
steps
.
<EOS>
The
Sergeant
stood
with
his
face
set
towards
a
gap
in
the
trees
,
commanding
a
view
of
one
of
the
windings
of
the
drive
which
led
from
the
house
.
<EOS>
He
had
his
hands
in
his
pockets
,
and
he
was
softly
whistling
"
The
Last
Rose
of
Summer
"
to
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
a
time
for
everything
,
"
I
said
savagely
enough
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
This
is
n't
a
time
for
whistling
.
"
  
<EOS>
At
that
moment
,
the
carriage
appeared
in
the
distance
,
through
the
gap
,
on
its
way
to
the
lodge
-
gate
.
<EOS>
There
was
another
man
,
besides
Samuel
,
plainly
visible
in
the
rumble
behind
.
  
<EOS>
"
All
right
!
"
said
the
Sergeant
to
himself
.
<EOS>
He
turned
round
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
no
time
for
whistling
,
Mr.
Betteredge
,
as
you
say
.
<EOS>
It
's
time
to
take
this
business
in
hand
,
now
,
without
sparing
anybody
.
<EOS>
We
'll
begin
with
Rosanna
Spearman
.
<EOS>
Where
is
Joyce
?
"
  
<EOS>
We
both
called
for
Joyce
,
and
received
no
answer
.
<EOS>
I
sent
one
of
the
stable
-
boys
to
look
for
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
heard
what
I
said
to
Miss
Verinder
?
"
remarked
the
Sergeant
,
while
we
were
waiting
.
"
<EOS>
And
you
saw
how
she
received
it
?
<EOS>
I
tell
her
plainly
that
her
leaving
us
will
be
an
obstacle
in
the
way
of
my
recovering
her
Diamond
 
<EOS>
and
she
leaves
,
in
the
face
of
that
statement
!
<EOS>
Your
young
lady
has
got
a
travelling
companion
in
her
mother
's
carriage
,
Mr.
Betteredge
 
and
the
name
of
it
is
,
the
Moonstone
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
said
nothing
.
<EOS>
I
only
held
on
like
death
to
my
belief
in
Miss
Rachel
.
  
<EOS>
The
stable
-
boy
came
back
,
followed
 
very
unwillingly
,
as
it
appeared
to
me
 
by
Joyce
.
  
<EOS>
"
Where
is
Rosanna
Spearman
?
"
asked
Sergeant
Cuff
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
account
for
it
,
sir
,
"
Joyce
began
;
"
and
I
am
very
sorry
.
<EOS>
But
somehow
or
other
 
"
  
"
Before
I
went
to
Frizinghall
,
"
said
the
Sergeant
,
cutting
him
short
,
"
I
told
you
to
keep
your
eyes
on
Rosanna
Spearman
,
without
allowing
her
to
discover
that
she
was
being
watched
.
<EOS>
Do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
you
have
let
her
give
you
the
slip
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
afraid
,
sir
,
"
says
Joyce
,
beginning
to
tremble
,
"
that
I
was
perhaps
a
little
TOO
careful
not
to
let
her
discover
me
.
<EOS>
There
are
such
a
many
passages
in
the
lower
parts
of
this
house
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
How
long
is
it
since
you
missed
her
?
"
  
"
Nigh
on
an
hour
since
,
sir
.
"
  
"
You
can
go
back
to
your
regular
business
at
Frizinghall
,
"
said
the
Sergeant
,
speaking
just
as
composedly
as
ever
,
in
his
usual
quiet
and
dreary
way
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
your
talents
are
at
all
in
our
line
,
Mr.
Joyce
.
<EOS>
Your
present
form
of
employment
is
a
trifle
beyond
you
.
<EOS>
Good
morning
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
man
slunk
off
.
<EOS>
I
find
it
very
difficult
to
describe
how
I
was
affected
by
the
discovery
that
Rosanna
Spearman
was
missing
.
<EOS>
I
seemed
to
be
in
fifty
different
minds
about
it
,
all
at
the
same
time
.
<EOS>
In
that
state
,
I
stood
staring
at
Sergeant
Cuff
 
and
my
powers
of
language
quite
failed
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
Mr.
Betteredge
,
"
said
the
Sergeant
,
as
if
he
had
discovered
the
uppermost
thought
in
me
,
and
was
picking
it
out
to
be
answered
,
before
all
the
rest
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Your
young
friend
,
Rosanna
,
wo
n't
slip
through
my
fingers
so
easy
as
you
think
.
<EOS>
As
long
as
I
know
where
Miss
Verinder
is
,
I
have
the
means
at
my
disposal
of
tracing
Miss
Verinder
's
accomplice
.
<EOS>
I
prevented
them
from
communicating
last
night
.
<EOS>
Very
good
.
<EOS>
They
will
get
together
at
Frizinghall
,
instead
of
getting
together
here
.
<EOS>
The
present
inquiry
must
be
simply
shifted
(
rather
sooner
than
I
had
anticipated
)
from
this
house
,
to
the
house
at
which
Miss
Verinder
is
visiting
.
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
,
I
'm
afraid
I
must
trouble
you
to
call
the
servants
together
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
went
round
with
him
to
the
servants
'
hall
.
<EOS>
It
is
very
disgraceful
,
but
it
is
not
the
less
true
,
that
I
had
another
attack
of
the
detective
-
fever
,
when
he
said
those
last
words
.
<EOS>
I
forgot
that
I
hated
Sergeant
Cuff
.
<EOS>
I
seized
him
confidentially
by
the
arm
.
<EOS>
I
said
,
"
For
goodness
'
sake
,
tell
us
what
you
are
going
to
do
with
the
servants
now
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
great
Cuff
stood
stock
still
,
and
addressed
himself
in
a
kind
of
melancholy
rapture
to
the
empty
air
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
this
man
,
"
said
the
Sergeant
(
apparently
meaning
me
)
,
"
only
understood
the
growing
of
roses
he
would
be
the
most
completely
perfect
character
on
the
face
of
creation
!
"
<EOS>
After
that
strong
expression
of
feeling
,
he
sighed
,
and
put
his
arm
through
mine
.
<EOS>
"
This
is
how
it
stands
,
"
he
said
,
dropping
down
again
to
business
.
"
<EOS>
Rosanna
has
done
one
of
two
things
.
<EOS>
She
has
either
gone
direct
to
Frizinghall
(
before
I
can
get
there
)
,
or
she
has
gone
first
to
visit
her
hiding
-
place
at
the
Shivering
Sand
.
<EOS>
The
first
thing
to
find
out
is
,
which
of
the
servants
saw
the
last
of
her
before
she
left
the
house
.
"
  
<EOS>
On
instituting
this
inquiry
,
it
turned
out
that
the
last
person
who
had
set
eyes
on
Rosanna
was
Nancy
,
the
kitchenmaid
.
  
<EOS>
Nancy
had
seen
her
slip
out
with
a
letter
in
her
hand
,
and
stop
the
butcher
's
man
who
had
just
been
delivering
some
meat
at
the
back
door
.
<EOS>
Nancy
had
heard
her
ask
the
man
to
post
the
letter
when
he
got
back
to
Frizinghall
.
<EOS>
The
man
had
looked
at
the
address
,
and
had
said
it
was
a
roundabout
way
of
delivering
a
letter
directed
to
Cobb
's
Hole
,
to
post
it
at
Frizinghall
 
and
that
,
moreover
,
on
a
Saturday
,
which
would
prevent
the
letter
from
getting
to
its
destination
until
Monday
morning
,
Rosanna
had
answered
that
the
delivery
of
the
letter
being
delayed
till
Monday
was
of
no
importance
.
<EOS>
The
only
thing
she
wished
to
be
sure
of
was
that
the
man
would
do
what
she
told
him
.
<EOS>
The
man
had
promised
to
do
it
,
and
had
driven
away
.
<EOS>
Nancy
had
been
called
back
to
her
work
in
the
kitchen
.
<EOS>
And
no
other
person
had
seen
anything
afterwards
of
Rosanna
Spearman
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
,
when
we
were
alone
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
says
the
Sergeant
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
go
to
Frizinghall
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
About
the
letter
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
The
memorandum
of
the
hiding
-
place
is
in
that
letter
.
<EOS>
I
must
see
the
address
at
the
post
-
office
.
<EOS>
If
it
is
the
address
<EOS>
I
suspect
,
I
shall
pay
our
friend
,
Mrs.
Yolland
,
another
visit
on
Monday
next
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
went
with
the
Sergeant
to
order
the
pony
-
chaise
.
<EOS>
In
the
stable
-
yard
we
got
a
new
light
thrown
on
the
missing
girl
.
    
<EOS>
The
news
of
Rosanna
's
disappearance
had
,
as
it
appeared
,
spread
among
the
out
-
of
-
door
servants
.
<EOS>
They
too
had
made
their
inquiries
;
and
they
had
just
laid
hands
on
a
quick
little
imp
,
nicknamed
"
Duffy
"
 
who
was
occasionally
employed
in
weeding
the
garden
,
and
who
had
seen
Rosanna
Spearman
as
lately
as
half
-
an
-
hour
since
.
<EOS>
Duffy
was
certain
that
the
girl
had
passed
him
in
the
fir
-
plantation
,
not
walking
,
but
RUNNING
,
in
the
direction
of
the
sea
-
shore
.
  
<EOS>
"
Does
this
boy
know
the
coast
hereabouts
?
"
asked
Sergeant
Cuff
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
has
been
born
and
bred
on
the
coast
,
"
I
answered
.
  
<EOS>
"
Duffy
!
"
says
the
Sergeant
,
"
do
you
want
to
earn
a
shilling
?
<EOS>
If
you
do
,
come
along
with
me
.
<EOS>
Keep
the
pony
-
chaise
ready
,
Mr.
Betteredge
,
till
I
come
back
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
started
for
the
Shivering
Sand
,
at
a
rate
that
my
legs
(
though
well
enough
preserved
for
my
time
of
life
)
had
no
hope
of
matching
.
<EOS>
Little
Duffy
,
as
the
way
is
with
the
young
savages
in
our
parts
when
they
are
in
high
spirits
,
gave
a
howl
,
and
trotted
off
at
the
Sergeant
's
heels
.
  
<EOS>
Here
again
,
I
find
it
impossible
to
give
anything
like
a
clear
account
of
the
state
of
my
mind
in
the
interval
after
Sergeant
Cuff
had
left
us
.
<EOS>
A
curious
and
stupefying
restlessness
got
possession
of
me
.
<EOS>
I
did
a
dozen
different
needless
things
in
and
out
of
the
house
,
not
one
of
which
I
can
now
remember
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
even
know
how
long
it
was
after
the
Sergeant
had
gone
to
the
sands
,
when
Duffy
came
running
back
with
a
message
for
me
.
<EOS>
Sergeant
Cuff
had
given
the
boy
a
leaf
torn
out
of
his
pocket
-
book
,
on
which
was
written
in
pencil
,
"
Send
me
one
of
Rosanna
Spearman
's
boots
,
and
be
quick
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
despatched
the
first
woman
-
servant
I
could
find
to
Rosanna
's
room
;
and
I
sent
the
boy
back
to
say
that
I
myself
would
follow
him
with
the
boot
.
  
<EOS>
This
,
I
am
well
aware
,
was
not
the
quickest
way
to
take
of
obeying
the
directions
which
I
had
received
.
<EOS>
But
I
was
resolved
to
see
for
myself
what
new
mystification
was
going
on
before
I
trusted
Rosanna
's
boot
in
the
Sergeant
's
hands
.
<EOS>
My
old
notion
of
screening
the
girl
,
if
I
could
,
seemed
to
have
come
back
on
me
again
,
at
the
eleventh
hour
.
<EOS>
This
state
of
feeling
(
to
say
nothing
of
the
detective
-
fever
)
hurried
me
off
,
as
soon
as
I
had
got
the
boot
,
at
the
nearest
approach
to
a
run
which
a
man
turned
seventy
can
reasonably
hope
to
make
.
  
<EOS>
As
I
got
near
the
shore
,
the
clouds
gathered
black
,
and
the
rain
came
down
,
drifting
in
great
white
sheets
of
water
before
the
wind
.
<EOS>
I
heard
the
thunder
of
the
sea
on
the
sand
-
bank
at
the
mouth
of
the
bay
.
<EOS>
A
little
further
on
,
I
passed
the
boy
crouching
for
shelter
under
the
lee
of
the
sand
hills
.
<EOS>
Then
I
saw
the
raging
sea
,
and
the
rollers
tumbling
in
on
the
sand
-
bank
,
and
the
driven
rain
sweeping
over
the
waters
like
a
flying
garment
,
and
the
yellow
wilderness
of
the
beach
with
one
solitary
black
figure
standing
on
it
 
the
figure
of
Sergeant
Cuff
.
  
<EOS>
He
waved
his
hand
towards
the
north
,
when
he
first
saw
me
.
"
<EOS>
Keep
on
that
side
!
"
<EOS>
he
shouted
.
<EOS>
"
And
come
on
down
here
to
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
I
went
down
to
him
,
choking
for
breath
,
with
my
heart
leaping
as
if
it
was
like
to
leap
out
of
me
.
<EOS>
I
was
past
speaking
.
<EOS>
I
had
a
hundred
questions
to
put
to
him
;
and
not
one
of
them
would
pass
my
lips
.
<EOS>
His
face
frightened
me
.
<EOS>
I
saw
a
look
in
his
eyes
which
was
a
look
of
horror
.
<EOS>
He
snatched
the
boot
out
of
my
hand
,
and
set
it
in
a
footmark
on
the
sand
,
bearing
south
from
us
as
we
stood
,
and
pointing
straight
towards
the
rocky
ledge
called
the
South
Spit
.
<EOS>
The
mark
was
not
yet
blurred
out
by
the
rain
 
and
the
girl
's
boot
fitted
it
to
a
hair
.
  
<EOS>
The
Sergeant
pointed
to
the
boot
in
the
footmark
,
without
saying
a
word
.
  
<EOS>
I
caught
at
his
arm
,
and
tried
to
speak
to
him
,
and
failed
as
I
had
failed
when
I
tried
before
.
<EOS>
He
went
on
,
following
the
footsteps
down
and
down
to
where
the
rocks
and
the
sand
joined
.
<EOS>
The
South
Spit
was
just
awash
with
the
flowing
tide
;
the
waters
heaved
over
the
hidden
face
of
the
Shivering
Sand
.
<EOS>
Now
this
way
and
now
that
,
with
an
obstinate
patience
that
was
dreadful
to
see
,
Sergeant
Cuff
tried
the
boot
in
the
footsteps
,
and
always
found
it
pointing
the
same
way
 
straight
TO
the
rocks
.
<EOS>
Hunt
as
he
might
,
no
sign
could
he
find
anywhere
of
the
footsteps
walking
FROM
them
.
  
<EOS>
He
gave
it
up
at
last
.
<EOS>
Still
keeping
silence
,
he
looked
again
at
me
;
and
then
he
looked
out
at
the
waters
before
us
,
heaving
in
deeper
and
deeper
over
the
quicksand
.
<EOS>
I
looked
where
he
looked
 
<EOS>
and
I
saw
his
thought
in
his
face
.
<EOS>
A
dreadful
dumb
trembling
crawled
all
over
me
on
a
sudden
.
<EOS>
I
fell
upon
my
knees
on
the
beach
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
has
been
back
at
the
hiding
-
place
,
"
<EOS>
I
heard
the
Sergeant
say
to
himself
.
"
<EOS>
Some
fatal
accident
has
happened
to
her
on
those
rocks
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
girl
's
altered
looks
,
and
words
,
and
actions
 
the
numbed
,
deadened
way
in
which
she
listened
to
me
,
and
spoke
to
me
 
when
I
had
found
her
sweeping
the
corridor
but
a
few
hours
since
,
rose
up
in
my
mind
,
and
warned
me
,
even
as
the
Sergeant
spoke
,
that
his
guess
was
wide
of
the
dreadful
truth
.
<EOS>
I
tried
to
tell
him
of
the
fear
that
had
frozen
me
up
.
<EOS>
I
tried
to
say
,
"
The
death
she
has
died
,
Sergeant
,
was
a
death
of
her
own
seeking
.
"
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
the
words
would
n't
come
.
<EOS>
The
dumb
trembling
held
me
in
its
grip
.
<EOS>
I
could
n't
feel
the
driving
rain
.
<EOS>
I
could
n't
see
the
rising
tide
.
<EOS>
As
in
the
vision
of
a
dream
,
the
poor
lost
creature
came
back
before
me
.
<EOS>
I
saw
her
again
as
I
had
seen
her
in
the
past
time
 
on
the
morning
when
I
went
to
fetch
her
into
the
house
.
<EOS>
I
heard
her
again
,
telling
me
that
the
Shivering
Sand
seemed
to
draw
her
to
it
against
her
will
,
and
wondering
whether
her
grave
was
waiting
for
her
THERE
.
<EOS>
The
horror
of
it
struck
at
me
,
in
some
unfathomable
way
,
through
my
own
child
.
<EOS>
My
girl
was
just
her
age
.
<EOS>
My
girl
,
tried
as
Rosanna
was
tried
,
might
have
lived
that
miserable
life
,
and
died
this
dreadful
death
.
  
<EOS>
The
Sergeant
kindly
lifted
me
up
,
and
turned
me
away
from
the
sight
of
the
place
where
she
had
perished
.
  
<EOS>
With
that
relief
,
I
began
to
fetch
my
breath
again
,
and
to
see
things
about
me
,
as
things
really
were
.
<EOS>
Looking
towards
the
sand
-
hills
,
I
saw
the
men
-
servants
from
out
-
of
-
doors
,
and
the
fisherman
,
named
Yolland
,
all
running
down
to
us
together
;
and
all
,
having
taken
the
alarm
,
calling
out
to
know
if
the
girl
had
been
found
.
<EOS>
In
the
fewest
words
,
the
Sergeant
showed
them
the
evidence
of
the
footmarks
,
and
told
them
that
a
fatal
accident
must
have
happened
to
her
.
<EOS>
He
then
picked
out
the
fisherman
from
the
rest
,
and
put
a
question
to
him
,
turning
about
again
towards
the
sea
:
"
Tell
me
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
Could
a
boat
have
taken
her
off
,
in
such
weather
as
this
,
from
those
rocks
where
her
footmarks
stop
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
fisherman
pointed
to
the
rollers
tumbling
in
on
the
sand
-
bank
,
and
to
the
great
waves
leaping
up
in
clouds
of
foam
against
the
headlands
on
either
side
of
us
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
boat
that
ever
was
built
,
"
he
answered
,
"
could
have
got
to
her
through
THAT
.
"
  
<EOS>
Sergeant
Cuff
looked
for
the
last
time
at
the
foot
-
marks
on
the
sand
,
which
the
rain
was
now
fast
blurring
out
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
,
"
he
said
,
"
is
the
evidence
that
she
ca
n't
have
left
this
place
by
land
.
<EOS>
And
here
,
"
he
went
on
,
looking
at
the
fisherman
,
"
is
the
evidence
that
she
ca
n't
have
got
away
by
sea
.
"
<EOS>
He
stopped
,
and
considered
for
a
minute
.
<EOS>
"
She
was
seen
running
towards
this
place
,
half
an
hour
before
I
got
here
from
the
house
,
"
he
said
to
Yolland
.
<EOS>
"
Some
time
has
passed
since
then
.
<EOS>
Call
it
,
altogether
,
an
hour
ago
.
<EOS>
How
high
would
the
water
be
,
at
that
time
,
on
this
side
of
the
rocks
?
"
<EOS>
He
pointed
to
the
south
side
 
otherwise
,
the
side
which
was
not
filled
up
by
the
quicksand
.
  
<EOS>
"
As
the
tide
makes
to
-
day
,
"
said
the
fisherman
,
"
there
would
n't
have
been
water
enough
to
drown
a
kitten
on
that
side
of
the
Spit
,
an
hour
since
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Sergeant
Cuff
turned
about
northward
,
towards
the
quicksand
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
much
on
this
side
?
"
he
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
Less
still
,
"
answered
Yolland
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
Shivering
Sand
would
have
been
just
awash
,
and
no
more
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
Sergeant
turned
to
me
,
and
said
that
the
accident
must
have
happened
on
the
side
of
the
quicksand
.
<EOS>
My
tongue
was
loosened
at
that
.
"
<EOS>
No
accident
!
<EOS>
"
I
told
him
.
<EOS>
"
When
she
came
to
this
place
,
she
came
weary
of
her
life
,
to
end
it
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
started
back
from
me
.
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
know
?
"
he
asked
.
<EOS>
The
rest
of
them
crowded
round
.
<EOS>
The
Sergeant
recovered
himself
instantly
.
<EOS>
He
put
them
back
from
me
;
he
said
I
was
an
old
man
;
he
said
the
discovery
had
shaken
me
;
he
said
,
"
Let
him
alone
a
little
.
"
<EOS>
Then
he
turned
to
Yolland
,
and
asked
,
"
Is
there
any
chance
of
finding
her
,
when
the
tide
ebbs
again
?
"
<EOS>
And
Yolland
answered
,
"
None
.
<EOS>
What
the
Sand
gets
,
the
Sand
keeps
for
ever
.
"
<EOS>
Having
said
that
,
the
fisherman
came
a
step
nearer
,
and
addressed
himself
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Betteredge
,
"
he
said
,
"
I
have
a
word
to
say
to
you
about
the
young
woman
's
death
.
<EOS>
Four
foot
out
,
broadwise
,
along
the
side
of
the
Spit
,
there
's
a
shelf
of
rock
,
about
half
fathom
down
under
the
sand
.
<EOS>
My
question
is
 
why
did
n't
she
strike
that
?
<EOS>
If
she
slipped
,
by
accident
,
from
off
the
Spit
,
she
fell
in
where
there
's
foothold
at
the
bottom
,
at
a
depth
that
would
barely
cover
her
to
the
waist
.
<EOS>
She
must
have
waded
out
,
or
jumped
out
,
into
the
Deeps
beyond
 
<EOS>
or
she
would
n't
be
missing
now
.
<EOS>
No
accident
,
sir
!
<EOS>
The
Deeps
of
the
Quicksand
have
got
her
.
<EOS>
And
they
have
got
her
by
her
own
act
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
After
that
testimony
from
a
man
whose
knowledge
was
to
be
relied
on
,
the
Sergeant
was
silent
.
<EOS>
The
rest
of
us
,
like
him
,
held
our
peace
.
<EOS>
With
one
accord
,
we
all
turned
back
up
the
slope
of
the
beach
.
  
<EOS>
At
the
sand
-
hillocks
we
were
met
by
the
under
-
groom
,
running
to
us
from
the
house
.
<EOS>
The
lad
is
a
good
lad
,
and
has
an
honest
respect
for
me
.
<EOS>
He
handed
me
a
little
note
,
with
a
decent
sorrow
in
his
face
.
"
<EOS>
Penelope
sent
me
with
this
,
Mr.
Betteredge
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
She
found
it
in
Rosanna
's
room
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
her
last
farewell
word
to
the
old
man
who
had
done
his
best
 
<EOS>
thank
God
,
always
done
his
best
 
to
befriend
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
often
forgiven
me
,
Mr.
Betteredge
,
in
past
times
.
<EOS>
When
you
next
see
the
Shivering
Sand
,
try
to
forgive
me
once
more
.
<EOS>
I
have
found
my
grave
where
my
grave
was
waiting
for
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
lived
,
and
died
,
sir
,
grateful
for
your
kindness
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
no
more
than
that
.
<EOS>
Little
as
it
was
,
I
had
n't
manhood
enough
to
hold
up
against
it
.
<EOS>
Your
tears
come
easy
,
when
you
're
young
,
and
beginning
the
world
.
<EOS>
Your
tears
come
easy
,
when
you
're
old
,
and
leaving
it
.
<EOS>
I
burst
out
crying
.
  
<EOS>
Sergeant
Cuff
took
a
step
nearer
to
me
 
meaning
kindly
,
I
do
n't
doubt
.
<EOS>
I
shrank
back
from
him
.
"
<EOS>
Do
n't
touch
me
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
the
dread
of
you
,
that
has
driven
her
to
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
wrong
,
Mr.
Betteredge
,
"
he
answered
,
quietly
.
"
<EOS>
But
there
will
be
time
enough
to
speak
of
it
when
we
are
indoors
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
followed
the
rest
of
them
,
with
the
help
of
the
groom
's
arm
.
<EOS>
Through
the
driving
rain
we
went
back
 
to
meet
the
trouble
and
the
terror
that
were
waiting
for
us
at
the
house
.
    
<EOS>
Those
in
front
had
spread
the
news
before
us
.
<EOS>
We
found
the
servants
in
a
state
of
panic
.
<EOS>
As
we
passed
my
lady
's
door
,
it
was
thrown
open
violently
from
the
inner
side
.
<EOS>
My
mistress
came
out
among
us
(
with
Mr.
Franklin
following
,
and
trying
vainly
to
compose
her
)
,
quite
beside
herself
with
the
horror
of
the
thing
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
answerable
for
this
!
"
<EOS>
she
cried
out
,
threatening
the
Sergeant
wildly
with
her
hand
.
"
<EOS>
Gabriel
!
<EOS>
give
that
wretch
his
money
 
and
release
me
from
the
sight
of
him
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
Sergeant
was
the
only
one
among
us
who
was
fit
to
cope
with
her
 
being
the
only
one
among
us
who
was
in
possession
of
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
no
more
answerable
for
this
distressing
calamity
,
my
lady
,
than
you
are
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
If
,
in
half
an
hour
from
this
,
you
still
insist
on
my
leaving
the
house
,
I
will
accept
your
ladyship
's
dismissal
,
but
not
your
ladyship
's
money
.
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
spoken
very
respectfully
,
but
very
firmly
at
the
same
time
 
<EOS>
and
it
had
its
effect
on
my
mistress
as
well
as
on
me
.
<EOS>
She
suffered
Mr.
Franklin
to
lead
her
back
into
the
room
.
<EOS>
As
the
door
closed
on
the
two
,
the
Sergeant
,
looking
about
among
the
women
-
servants
in
his
observant
way
,
noticed
that
while
all
the
rest
were
merely
frightened
,
Penelope
was
in
tears
.
<EOS>
"
When
your
father
has
changed
his
wet
clothes
,
"
he
said
to
her
,
"
come
and
speak
to
us
,
in
your
father
's
room
.
"
  
<EOS>
Before
the
half
-
hour
was
out
,
I
had
got
my
dry
clothes
on
,
and
had
lent
Sergeant
Cuff
such
change
of
dress
as
he
required
.
<EOS>
Penelope
came
in
to
us
to
hear
what
the
Sergeant
wanted
with
her
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
think
I
ever
felt
what
a
good
dutiful
daughter
I
had
,
so
strongly
as
I
felt
it
at
that
moment
.
<EOS>
I
took
her
and
sat
her
on
my
knee
and
I
prayed
God
bless
her
.
<EOS>
She
hid
her
head
on
my
bosom
,
and
put
her
arms
<EOS>
round
my
neck
 
<EOS>
and
we
waited
a
little
while
in
silence
.
<EOS>
The
poor
dead
girl
must
have
been
at
the
bottom
of
it
,
I
think
,
with
my
daughter
and
with
me
.
<EOS>
The
Sergeant
went
to
the
window
,
and
stood
there
looking
out
.
<EOS>
I
thought
it
right
to
thank
him
for
considering
us
both
in
this
way
 
<EOS>
and
I
did
.
  
<EOS>
People
in
high
life
have
all
the
luxuries
to
themselves
 
among
others
,
the
luxury
of
indulging
their
feelings
.
<EOS>
People
in
low
life
have
no
such
privilege
.
<EOS>
Necessity
,
which
spares
our
betters
,
has
no
pity
on
us
.
<EOS>
We
learn
to
put
our
feelings
back
into
ourselves
,
and
to
jog
on
with
our
duties
as
patiently
as
may
be
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
complain
of
this
 
<EOS>
I
only
notice
it
.
<EOS>
Penelope
and
I
were
ready
for
the
Sergeant
,
as
soon
as
the
Sergeant
was
ready
on
his
side
.
<EOS>
Asked
if
she
knew
what
had
led
her
fellow
-
servant
to
destroy
herself
,
my
daughter
answered
(
as
you
will
foresee
)
that
it
was
for
love
of
Mr.
Franklin
Blake
.
<EOS>
Asked
next
,
if
she
had
mentioned
this
notion
of
hers
to
any
other
person
,
Penelope
answered
,
"
I
have
not
mentioned
it
,
for
Rosanna
's
sake
.
<EOS>
"
I
felt
it
necessary
to
add
a
word
to
this
.
<EOS>
I
said
,
"
<EOS>
And
for
Mr.
Franklin
's
sake
,
my
dear
,
as
well
.
<EOS>
If
Rosanna
HAS
died
for
love
of
him
,
it
is
not
with
his
knowledge
or
by
his
fault
.
<EOS>
Let
him
leave
the
house
to
-
day
,
if
he
does
leave
it
,
without
the
useless
pain
of
knowing
the
truth
.
"
<EOS>
Sergeant
Cuff
said
,
"
Quite
right
,
"
and
fell
silent
again
;
comparing
Penelope
's
notion
(
as
it
seemed
to
me
)
with
some
other
notion
of
his
own
which
he
kept
to
himself
.
  
<EOS>
At
the
end
of
the
half
-
hour
,
my
mistress
's
bell
rang
.
  
<EOS>
On
my
way
to
answer
it
,
I
met
Mr.
Franklin
coming
out
of
his
aunt
's
sitting
-
room
.
<EOS>
He
mentioned
that
her
ladyship
was
ready
to
see
Sergeant
Cuff
 
in
my
presence
as
before
 
<EOS>
and
he
added
that
he
himself
wanted
to
say
two
words
to
the
Sergeant
first
.
<EOS>
On
our
way
back
to
my
room
,
he
stopped
,
and
looked
at
the
railway
time
-
table
in
the
hall
.
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
really
going
to
leave
us
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
"
<EOS>
Miss
Rachel
will
surely
come
right
again
,
if
you
only
give
her
time
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
will
come
right
again
,
"
answered
Mr.
Franklin
,
"
when
she
hears
that
I
have
gone
away
,
and
that
she
will
see
me
no
more
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
thought
he
spoke
in
resentment
of
my
young
lady
's
treatment
of
him
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
not
so
.
<EOS>
My
mistress
had
noticed
,
from
the
time
when
the
police
first
came
into
the
house
,
that
the
bare
mention
of
him
was
enough
to
set
Miss
Rachel
's
temper
in
a
flame
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
too
fond
of
his
cousin
to
like
to
confess
this
to
himself
,
until
the
truth
had
been
forced
on
him
,
when
she
drove
off
to
her
aunt
's
.
<EOS>
His
eyes
once
opened
in
that
cruel
way
which
you
know
of
,
Mr.
Franklin
had
taken
his
resolution
 
the
one
resolution
which
a
man
of
any
spirit
COULD
take
 
to
leave
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
What
he
had
to
say
to
the
Sergeant
was
spoken
in
my
presence
.
<EOS>
He
described
her
ladyship
as
willing
to
acknowledge
that
she
had
spoken
over
-
hastily
.
<EOS>
And
he
asked
if
Sergeant
Cuff
would
consent
 
in
that
case
 
to
accept
his
fee
,
and
to
leave
the
matter
of
the
Diamond
where
the
matter
stood
now
.
<EOS>
The
Sergeant
answered
,
"
No
,
sir
.
<EOS>
My
fee
is
paid
me
for
doing
my
duty
.
<EOS>
I
decline
to
take
it
,
until
my
duty
is
done
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
understand
you
,
"
says
Mr.
Franklin
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
explain
myself
,
sir
,
"
says
the
Sergeant
.
<EOS>
"
When
I
came
here
,
I
undertook
to
throw
the
necessary
light
on
the
matter
of
the
missing
Diamond
.
<EOS>
I
am
now
ready
,
and
waiting
to
redeem
my
pledge
.
<EOS>
When
I
have
stated
the
case
to
Lady
Verinder
as
the
case
now
stands
,
and
when
I
have
told
her
plainly
what
course
of
action
to
take
for
the
recovery
of
the
Moonstone
,
the
responsibility
will
be
off
my
shoulders
.
<EOS>
Let
her
ladyship
decide
,
after
that
,
whether
she
does
,
or
does
not
,
allow
me
to
go
on
.
<EOS>
I
shall
then
have
done
what
I
undertook
to
do
 
<EOS>
and
I
'll
take
my
fee
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
In
those
words
Sergeant
Cuff
reminded
us
that
,
even
in
the
Detective
Police
,
a
man
may
have
a
reputation
to
lose
.
  
<EOS>
The
view
he
took
was
so
plainly
the
right
one
,
that
there
was
no
more
to
be
said
.
<EOS>
As
I
rose
to
conduct
him
to
my
lady
's
room
,
he
asked
if
Mr.
Franklin
wished
to
be
present
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Franklin
answered
,
"
Not
unless
Lady
Verinder
desires
it
.
"
<EOS>
He
added
,
in
a
whisper
to
me
,
as
I
was
following
the
Sergeant
out
,
"
I
know
what
that
man
is
going
to
say
about
Rachel
;
and
I
am
too
fond
of
her
to
hear
it
,
and
keep
my
temper
.
<EOS>
Leave
me
by
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
left
him
,
miserable
enough
,
leaning
on
the
sill
of
my
window
,
with
his
face
hidden
in
his
hands
and
Penelope
peeping
through
the
door
,
longing
to
comfort
him
.
<EOS>
In
Mr.
Franklin
's
place
,
I
should
have
called
her
in
.
<EOS>
When
you
are
ill
-
used
by
one
woman
,
there
is
great
comfort
in
telling
it
to
another
 
because
,
nine
times
out
of
ten
,
the
other
always
takes
your
side
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
,
when
my
back
was
turned
,
he
did
call
her
in
?
<EOS>
In
that
case
it
is
only
doing
my
daughter
justice
to
declare
that
she
would
stick
at
nothing
,
in
the
way
of
comforting
Mr.
Franklin
Blake
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
,
Sergeant
Cuff
and
I
proceeded
to
my
lady
's
room
.
  
<EOS>
At
the
last
conference
we
had
held
with
her
,
we
had
found
her
not
over
willing
to
lift
her
eyes
from
the
book
which
she
had
on
the
table
.
<EOS>
On
this
occasion
there
was
a
change
for
the
better
.
<EOS>
She
met
the
Sergeant
's
eye
with
an
eye
that
was
as
steady
as
his
own
.
<EOS>
The
family
spirit
showed
itself
in
every
line
of
her
face
;
and
I
knew
that
Sergeant
Cuff
would
meet
his
match
,
when
a
woman
like
my
mistress
was
strung
up
to
hear
the
worst
he
could
say
to
her
.
    
<EOS>
The
first
words
,
when
we
had
taken
our
seats
,
were
spoken
by
my
lady
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sergeant
Cuff
,
"
she
said
,
"
there
was
perhaps
some
excuse
for
the
inconsiderate
manner
in
which
I
spoke
to
you
half
an
hour
since
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
wish
,
however
,
to
claim
that
excuse
.
<EOS>
I
say
,
with
perfect
sincerity
,
that
I
regret
it
,
if
I
wronged
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
grace
of
voice
and
manner
with
which
she
made
him
that
atonement
had
its
due
effect
on
the
Sergeant
.
<EOS>
He
requested
permission
to
justify
himself
 
putting
his
justification
as
an
act
of
respect
to
my
mistress
.
<EOS>
It
was
impossible
,
he
said
,
that
he
could
be
in
any
way
responsible
for
the
calamity
,
which
had
shocked
us
all
,
for
this
sufficient
reason
,
that
his
success
in
bringing
his
inquiry
to
its
proper
end
depended
on
his
neither
saying
nor
doing
anything
that
could
alarm
Rosanna
Spearman
.
<EOS>
He
appealed
to
me
to
testify
whether
he
had
,
or
had
not
,
carried
that
object
out
.
<EOS>
I
could
,
and
did
,
bear
witness
that
he
had
.
<EOS>
And
there
,
as
I
thought
,
the
matter
might
have
been
judiciously
left
to
come
to
an
end
.
  
<EOS>
Sergeant
Cuff
,
however
,
took
it
a
step
further
,
evidently
(
as
you
shall
now
judge
)
with
the
purpose
of
forcing
the
most
painful
of
all
possible
explanations
to
take
place
between
her
ladyship
and
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
heard
a
motive
assigned
for
the
young
woman
's
suicide
,
"
said
the
Sergeant
,
"
which
may
possibly
be
the
right
one
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
motive
quite
unconnected
with
the
case
which
I
am
conducting
here
.
<EOS>
I
am
bound
to
add
,
however
,
that
my
own
opinion
points
the
other
way
.
<EOS>
Some
unbearable
anxiety
in
connexion
with
the
missing
Diamond
,
has
,
I
believe
,
driven
the
poor
creature
to
her
own
destruction
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
pretend
to
know
what
that
unbearable
anxiety
may
have
been
.
<EOS>
But
I
think
(
with
your
ladyship
's
permission
)
I
can
lay
my
hand
on
a
person
who
is
capable
of
deciding
whether
I
am
right
or
wrong
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
the
person
now
in
the
house
?
"
<EOS>
my
mistress
asked
,
after
waiting
a
little
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
person
has
left
the
house
,
my
lady
.
"
  
<EOS>
That
answer
pointed
as
straight
to
Miss
Rachel
as
straight
could
be
.
<EOS>
A
silence
dropped
on
us
which
I
thought
would
never
come
to
an
end
.
<EOS>
Lord
!
<EOS>
how
the
wind
howled
,
and
how
the
rain
drove
at
the
window
,
as
I
sat
there
waiting
for
one
or
other
of
them
to
speak
again
!
  
<EOS>
"
Be
so
good
as
to
express
yourself
plainly
,
"
said
my
lady
.
<EOS>
"
Do
you
refer
to
my
daughter
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
,
"
said
Sergeant
Cuff
,
in
so
many
words
.
  
<EOS>
My
mistress
had
her
cheque
-
book
on
the
table
when
we
entered
the
room
 
no
doubt
to
pay
the
Sergeant
his
fee
.
<EOS>
She
now
put
it
back
in
the
drawer
.
<EOS>
It
went
to
my
heart
to
see
how
her
poor
hand
trembled
 
the
hand
that
had
loaded
her
old
servant
with
benefits
;
the
hand
that
,
I
pray
God
,
may
take
mine
,
when
my
time
comes
,
and
I
leave
my
place
for
ever
!
  
<EOS>
"
I
had
hoped
,
"
said
my
lady
,
very
slowly
and
quietly
,
"
to
have
recompensed
your
services
,
and
to
have
parted
with
you
without
Miss
Verinder
's
name
having
been
openly
mentioned
between
us
as
it
has
been
mentioned
now
.
<EOS>
My
nephew
has
probably
said
something
of
this
,
before
you
came
into
my
room
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Mr.
Blake
gave
his
message
,
my
lady
.
<EOS>
And
I
gave
Mr.
Blake
a
reason
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
It
is
needless
to
tell
me
your
reason
.
<EOS>
After
what
you
have
just
said
,
you
know
as
well
as
I
do
that
you
have
gone
too
far
to
go
back
.
<EOS>
I
owe
it
to
myself
,
and
I
owe
it
to
my
child
,
to
insist
on
your
remaining
here
,
and
to
insist
on
your
speaking
out
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
Sergeant
looked
at
his
watch
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
there
had
been
time
,
my
lady
,
"
he
answered
,
"
I
should
have
preferred
writing
my
report
,
instead
of
communicating
it
by
word
of
mouth
.
<EOS>
But
,
if
this
inquiry
is
to
go
on
,
time
is
of
too
much
importance
to
be
wasted
in
writing
.
<EOS>
I
am
ready
to
go
into
the
matter
at
once
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
very
painful
matter
for
me
to
speak
of
,
and
for
you
to
hear
.
"
  
<EOS>
There
my
mistress
stopped
him
once
more
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
may
possibly
make
it
less
painful
to
you
,
and
to
my
good
servant
and
friend
here
,
"
she
said
,
"
if
I
set
the
example
of
speaking
boldly
,
on
my
side
.
<EOS>
You
suspect
Miss
Verinder
of
deceiving
us
all
,
by
secreting
the
Diamond
for
some
purpose
of
her
own
?
<EOS>
Is
that
true
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Quite
true
,
my
lady
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
well
.
<EOS>
Now
,
before
you
begin
,
I
have
to
tell
you
,
as
Miss
Verinder
's
mother
,
that
she
is
ABSOLUTELY
INCAPABLE
of
doing
what
you
suppose
her
to
have
done
.
<EOS>
Your
knowledge
of
her
character
dates
from
a
day
or
two
since
.
<EOS>
My
knowledge
of
her
character
dates
from
the
beginning
of
her
life
.
<EOS>
State
your
suspicion
of
her
as
strongly
as
you
please
 
<EOS>
it
is
impossible
that
you
can
offend
me
by
doing
so
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
,
beforehand
,
that
(
with
all
your
experience
)
the
circumstances
have
fatally
misled
you
in
this
case
.
<EOS>
Mind
!
<EOS>
I
am
in
possession
of
no
private
information
.
<EOS>
I
am
as
absolutely
shut
out
of
my
daughter
's
confidence
as
you
are
.
<EOS>
My
one
reason
for
speaking
positively
,
is
the
reason
you
have
heard
already
.
<EOS>
I
know
my
child
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
turned
to
me
,
and
gave
me
her
hand
.
<EOS>
I
kissed
it
in
silence
.
<EOS>
"
You
may
go
on
,
"
she
said
,
facing
the
Sergeant
again
as
steadily
as
ever
.
  
<EOS>
Sergeant
Cuff
bowed
.
<EOS>
My
mistress
had
produced
but
one
effect
on
him
.
<EOS>
His
hatchet
-
face
softened
for
a
moment
,
as
if
he
was
sorry
for
her
.
<EOS>
As
to
shaking
him
in
his
own
conviction
,
it
was
plain
to
see
that
she
had
not
moved
him
by
a
single
inch
.
<EOS>
He
settled
himself
in
his
chair
;
and
he
began
his
vile
attack
on
Miss
Rachel
's
character
in
these
words
:
  
"
I
must
ask
your
ladyship
,
"
he
said
,
"
to
look
this
matter
in
the
face
,
from
my
point
of
view
as
well
as
from
yours
.
<EOS>
Will
you
please
to
suppose
yourself
coming
down
here
,
in
my
place
,
and
with
my
experience
?
<EOS>
and
will
you
allow
me
to
mention
very
briefly
what
that
experience
has
been
?
"
  
<EOS>
My
mistress
signed
to
him
that
she
would
do
this
.
<EOS>
The
Sergeant
went
on
:
  
"
<EOS>
For
the
last
twenty
years
,
"
he
said
,
"
I
have
been
largely
employed
in
cases
of
family
scandal
,
acting
in
the
capacity
of
confidential
man
.
<EOS>
The
one
result
of
my
domestic
practice
which
has
any
bearing
on
the
matter
now
in
hand
,
is
a
result
which
I
may
state
in
two
words
.
<EOS>
It
is
well
within
my
experience
,
that
young
ladies
of
rank
and
position
do
occasionally
have
private
debts
which
they
dare
not
acknowledge
to
their
nearest
relatives
and
friends
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
,
the
milliner
and
the
jeweller
are
at
the
bottom
of
it
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
,
the
money
is
wanted
for
purposes
which
I
do
n't
suspect
in
this
case
,
and
which
I
wo
n't
shock
you
by
mentioning
.
<EOS>
Bear
in
mind
<EOS>
what
I
have
said
,
my
lady
 
<EOS>
and
now
let
us
see
how
events
in
this
house
have
forced
me
back
on
my
own
experience
,
whether
I
liked
it
or
not
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
considered
with
himself
for
a
moment
,
and
went
on
 
with
a
horrid
clearness
that
obliged
you
to
understand
him
;
with
an
abominable
justice
that
favoured
nobody
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
first
information
relating
to
the
loss
of
the
Moonstone
,
"
said
the
Sergeant
,
"
came
to
me
from
Superintendent
Seegrave
.
<EOS>
He
proved
to
my
complete
satisfaction
that
he
was
perfectly
incapable
of
managing
the
case
.
<EOS>
The
one
thing
he
said
which
struck
me
as
worth
listening
to
,
was
this
 
that
Miss
Verinder
had
declined
to
be
questioned
by
him
,
and
had
spoken
to
him
with
a
perfectly
incomprehensible
rudeness
and
contempt
.
<EOS>
I
thought
this
curious
 
<EOS>
but
I
attributed
it
mainly
to
some
clumsiness
on
the
Superintendent
's
part
which
might
have
offended
the
young
lady
.
<EOS>
After
that
,
I
put
it
by
in
my
mind
,
and
applied
myself
,
single
-
handed
,
to
the
case
.
<EOS>
It
ended
,
as
you
are
aware
,
in
the
discovery
of
the
smear
on
the
door
,
and
in
Mr.
Franklin
Blake
's
evidence
satisfying
me
,
that
this
same
smear
,
and
the
loss
of
the
Diamond
,
were
pieces
of
the
same
puzzle
.
<EOS>
So
far
,
if
I
suspected
anything
,
I
suspected
that
the
Moonstone
had
been
stolen
,
and
that
one
of
the
servants
might
prove
to
be
the
thief
.
<EOS>
Very
good
.
<EOS>
In
this
state
of
things
,
what
happens
?
<EOS>
Miss
Verinder
suddenly
comes
out
of
her
room
,
and
speaks
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
observe
three
suspicious
appearances
in
that
young
lady
.
<EOS>
She
is
still
violently
agitated
,
though
more
than
four
-
and
-
twenty
hours
have
passed
since
the
Diamond
was
lost
.
<EOS>
She
treats
me
as
she
has
already
treated
Superintendent
Seegrave
.
<EOS>
And
she
is
mortally
offended
with
Mr.
Franklin
Blake
.
<EOS>
Very
good
again
.
<EOS>
Here
(
I
say
to
myself
)
is
a
young
lady
who
has
lost
a
valuable
jewel
 
a
young
lady
,
also
,
as
my
own
eyes
and
ears
inform
me
,
who
is
of
an
impetuous
temperament
.
<EOS>
Under
these
circumstances
,
and
with
that
character
,
what
does
she
do
?
<EOS>
She
betrays
an
incomprehensible
resentment
against
Mr.
Blake
,
Mr.
Superintendent
,
and
myself
 
<EOS>
otherwise
,
the
very
three
people
who
have
all
,
in
their
different
ways
,
been
trying
to
help
her
to
recover
her
lost
jewel
.
<EOS>
Having
brought
my
inquiry
to
that
point
 
THEN
,
my
lady
,
and
not
till
then
,
I
begin
to
look
back
into
my
own
mind
for
my
own
experience
.
<EOS>
My
own
experience
explains
Miss
Verinder
's
otherwise
incomprehensible
conduct
.
<EOS>
It
associates
her
with
those
other
young
ladies
that
I
know
of
.
<EOS>
It
tells
me
she
has
debts
she
dare
n't
acknowledge
,
that
must
be
paid
.
<EOS>
And
it
sets
me
asking
myself
,
whether
the
loss
of
the
Diamond
may
not
mean
 
that
the
Diamond
must
be
secretly
pledged
to
pay
them
.
<EOS>
That
is
the
conclusion
which
my
experience
draws
from
plain
facts
.
<EOS>
What
does
your
ladyship
's
experience
say
against
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
I
have
said
already
,
"
answered
my
mistress
.
<EOS>
"
The
circumstances
have
misled
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
said
nothing
on
my
side
.
<EOS>
ROBINSON
CRUSOE
 
<EOS>
God
knows
how
 
had
got
into
my
muddled
old
head
.
<EOS>
If
Sergeant
Cuff
had
found
himself
,
at
that
moment
,
transported
to
a
desert
island
,
without
a
man
Friday
to
keep
him
company
,
or
a
ship
to
take
him
off
 
<EOS>
he
would
have
found
himself
exactly
where
I
wished
him
to
be
!
<EOS>
(
Nota
bene
:
 
<EOS>
I
am
an
average
good
Christian
,
when
you
do
n't
push
my
Christianity
too
far
.
<EOS>
And
all
the
rest
of
you
 
which
is
a
great
comfort
 
are
,
in
this
respect
,
much
the
same
as
I
am
.
)
  
<EOS>
Sergeant
Cuff
went
on
:
  
"
<EOS>
Right
or
wrong
,
my
lady
,
"
he
said
,
"
having
drawn
my
conclusion
,
the
next
thing
to
do
was
to
put
it
to
the
test
.
<EOS>
I
suggested
to
your
ladyship
the
examination
of
all
the
wardrobes
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
means
of
finding
the
article
of
dress
which
had
,
in
all
probability
,
made
the
smear
;
and
it
was
a
means
of
putting
my
conclusion
to
the
test
.
<EOS>
How
did
it
turn
out
?
<EOS>
Your
ladyship
consented
;
Mr.
Blake
consented
;
Mr.
Ablewhite
consented
.
<EOS>
Miss
Verinder
alone
stopped
the
whole
proceeding
by
refusing
point
-
blank
.
<EOS>
That
result
satisfied
me
that
my
view
was
the
right
one
.
<EOS>
If
your
ladyship
and
Mr.
Betteredge
persist
in
not
agreeing
with
me
,
you
must
be
blind
to
what
happened
before
you
this
very
day
.
<EOS>
In
your
hearing
,
I
told
the
young
lady
that
her
leaving
the
house
(
as
things
were
then
)
would
put
an
obstacle
in
the
way
of
my
recovering
her
jewel
.
<EOS>
You
saw
yourselves
that
she
drove
off
in
the
face
of
that
statement
.
<EOS>
You
saw
yourself
that
,
so
far
from
forgiving
Mr.
Blake
for
having
done
more
than
all
the
rest
of
you
to
put
the
clue
into
my
hands
,
she
publicly
insulted
Mr.
Blake
,
on
the
steps
of
her
mother
's
house
.
<EOS>
What
do
these
things
mean
?
<EOS>
If
Miss
Verinder
is
not
privy
to
the
suppression
of
the
Diamond
,
what
do
these
things
mean
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
time
he
looked
my
way
.
<EOS>
It
was
downright
frightful
to
hear
him
piling
up
proof
after
proof
against
Miss
Rachel
,
and
to
know
,
while
one
was
longing
to
defend
her
,
that
there
was
no
disputing
the
truth
of
what
he
said
.
<EOS>
I
am
(
thank
God
!
)
<EOS>
constitutionally
superior
to
reason
.
<EOS>
This
enabled
me
to
hold
firm
to
my
lady
's
view
,
which
was
my
view
also
.
<EOS>
This
roused
my
spirit
,
and
made
me
put
a
bold
face
on
it
before
Sergeant
Cuff
.
<EOS>
Profit
,
good
friends
,
I
beseech
you
,
by
my
example
.
<EOS>
It
will
save
you
from
many
troubles
of
the
vexing
sort
.
<EOS>
Cultivate
a
superiority
to
reason
,
and
see
how
you
pare
the
claws
of
all
the
sensible
people
when
they
try
to
scratch
you
for
your
own
good
!
  
<EOS>
Finding
that
I
made
no
remark
,
and
that
my
mistress
made
no
remark
,
Sergeant
Cuff
proceeded
.
<EOS>
Lord
!
<EOS>
how
it
did
enrage
me
to
notice
that
he
was
not
in
the
least
put
out
by
our
silence
!
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
the
case
,
my
lady
,
as
it
stands
against
Miss
Verinder
alone
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
The
next
thing
is
to
put
the
case
as
it
stands
against
Miss
Verinder
and
the
deceased
Rosanna
Spearman
taken
together
.
<EOS>
We
will
go
back
for
a
moment
,
if
you
please
,
to
your
daughter
's
refusal
to
let
her
wardrobe
be
examined
.
<EOS>
My
mind
being
made
up
,
after
that
circumstance
,
I
had
two
questions
to
consider
next
.
<EOS>
First
,
as
to
the
right
method
of
conducting
my
inquiry
.
<EOS>
Second
,
as
to
whether
Miss
Verinder
had
an
accomplice
among
the
female
servants
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
After
carefully
thinking
it
over
,
I
determined
to
conduct
the
inquiry
in
,
what
we
should
call
at
our
office
,
a
highly
irregular
manner
.
<EOS>
For
this
reason
:
I
had
a
family
scandal
to
deal
with
,
which
it
was
my
business
to
keep
within
the
family
limits
.
<EOS>
The
less
noise
made
,
and
the
fewer
strangers
employed
to
help
me
,
the
better
.
<EOS>
As
to
the
usual
course
of
taking
people
in
custody
on
suspicion
,
going
before
the
magistrate
,
and
all
the
rest
of
it
 
<EOS>
nothing
of
the
sort
was
to
be
thought
of
,
when
your
ladyship
's
daughter
was
(
as
I
believed
)
at
the
bottom
of
the
whole
business
.
<EOS>
In
this
case
,
I
felt
that
a
person
of
Mr.
Betteredge
's
character
and
position
in
the
house
 
knowing
the
servants
as
he
did
,
and
having
the
honour
of
the
family
at
heart
 
would
be
safer
to
take
as
an
assistant
than
any
other
person
whom
I
could
lay
my
hand
on
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
tried
Mr.
Blake
as
well
 
<EOS>
but
for
one
obstacle
in
the
way
.
<EOS>
HE
saw
the
drift
of
my
proceedings
at
a
very
early
date
;
and
,
with
his
interest
in
Miss
Verinder
,
any
mutual
understanding
was
impossible
between
him
and
me
.
<EOS>
I
trouble
your
ladyship
with
these
particulars
to
show
you
that
I
have
kept
the
family
secret
within
the
family
circle
.
<EOS>
I
am
the
only
outsider
who
knows
it
 
and
my
professional
existence
depends
on
holding
my
tongue
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Here
I
felt
that
my
professional
existence
depended
on
not
holding
my
tongue
.
<EOS>
To
be
held
up
before
my
mistress
,
in
my
old
age
,
as
a
sort
of
deputy
-
policeman
,
was
,
once
again
,
more
than
my
Christianity
was
strong
enough
to
bear
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
beg
to
inform
your
ladyship
,
"
I
said
,
"
that
I
never
,
to
my
knowledge
,
helped
this
abominable
detective
business
,
in
any
way
,
from
first
to
last
;
and
I
summon
Sergeant
Cuff
to
contradict
me
,
if
he
dares
!
"
  
<EOS>
Having
given
vent
in
those
words
,
I
felt
greatly
relieved
.
<EOS>
Her
ladyship
honoured
me
by
a
little
friendly
pat
on
the
shoulder
.
<EOS>
I
looked
with
righteous
indignation
at
the
Sergeant
,
to
see
what
he
thought
of
such
a
testimony
as
THAT
.
<EOS>
The
Sergeant
looked
back
like
a
lamb
,
and
seemed
to
like
me
better
than
ever
.
  
<EOS>
My
lady
informed
him
that
he
might
continue
his
statement
.
<EOS>
"
I
understand
,
"
she
said
,
"
that
you
have
honestly
done
your
best
,
in
what
you
believe
to
be
my
interest
.
<EOS>
I
am
ready
to
hear
what
you
have
to
say
next
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
I
have
to
say
next
,
"
answered
Sergeant
Cuff
,
"
relates
to
Rosanna
Spearman
.
<EOS>
I
recognised
the
young
woman
,
as
your
ladyship
may
remember
,
when
she
brought
the
washing
-
book
into
this
room
.
<EOS>
Up
to
that
time
I
was
inclined
to
doubt
whether
Miss
Verinder
had
trusted
her
secret
to
any
one
.
<EOS>
When
I
saw
Rosanna
,
I
altered
my
mind
.
<EOS>
I
suspected
her
at
once
of
being
privy
to
the
suppression
of
the
Diamond
.
<EOS>
The
poor
creature
has
met
her
death
by
a
dreadful
end
,
and
I
do
n't
want
your
ladyship
to
think
,
now
she
's
gone
,
that
I
was
unduly
hard
on
her
.
<EOS>
If
this
had
been
a
common
case
of
thieving
,
I
should
have
given
Rosanna
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
just
as
freely
as
I
should
have
given
it
to
any
of
the
other
servants
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
Our
experience
of
the
Reformatory
woman
is
,
that
when
tried
in
service
 
and
when
kindly
and
judiciously
treated
 
they
prove
themselves
in
the
majority
of
cases
to
be
honestly
penitent
,
and
honestly
worthy
of
the
pains
taken
with
them
.
<EOS>
But
this
was
not
a
common
case
of
thieving
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
case
 
in
my
mind
 
of
a
deeply
planned
fraud
,
with
the
owner
of
the
Diamond
at
the
bottom
of
it
.
<EOS>
Holding
this
view
,
the
first
consideration
which
naturally
presented
itself
to
me
,
in
connection
with
Rosanna
,
was
this
:
Would
Miss
Verinder
be
satisfied
(
begging
your
ladyship
's
pardon
)
with
leading
us
all
to
think
that
the
Moonstone
was
merely
lost
?
<EOS>
Or
would
she
go
a
step
further
,
and
delude
us
into
believing
that
the
Moonstone
was
stolen
?
<EOS>
In
the
latter
event
there
was
Rosanna
Spearman
 
with
the
character
of
a
thief
 
ready
to
her
hand
;
the
person
of
all
others
to
lead
your
ladyship
off
,
and
to
lead
me
off
,
on
a
false
scent
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Was
it
possible
<EOS>
(
I
asked
myself
)
that
he
could
put
his
case
against
Miss
Rachel
and
Rosanna
in
a
more
horrid
point
of
view
than
this
?
<EOS>
It
WAS
possible
,
as
you
shall
now
see
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
had
another
reason
for
suspecting
the
deceased
woman
,
"
he
said
,
"
which
appears
to
me
to
have
been
stronger
still
.
<EOS>
Who
would
be
the
very
person
to
help
Miss
Verinder
in
raising
money
privately
on
the
Diamond
?
<EOS>
Rosanna
Spearman
.
<EOS>
No
young
lady
in
Miss
Verinder
's
position
could
manage
such
a
risky
matter
as
that
by
herself
.
<EOS>
A
go
-
between
she
must
have
,
and
who
so
fit
,
I
ask
again
,
as
Rosanna
Spearman
?
<EOS>
Your
ladyship
's
deceased
housemaid
was
at
the
top
of
her
profession
when
she
was
a
thief
.
<EOS>
She
had
relations
,
to
my
certain
knowledge
,
with
one
of
the
few
men
in
London
(
in
the
money
-
lending
line
)
who
would
advance
a
large
sum
on
such
a
notable
jewel
as
the
Moonstone
,
without
asking
awkward
questions
,
or
insisting
on
awkward
conditions
.
<EOS>
Bear
this
in
mind
,
my
lady
;
and
now
let
me
show
you
how
my
suspicions
have
been
justified
by
Rosanna
's
own
acts
,
and
by
the
plain
inferences
to
be
drawn
from
them
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
thereupon
passed
the
whole
of
Rosanna
's
proceedings
under
review
.
<EOS>
You
are
already
as
well
acquainted
with
those
proceedings
as
I
am
;
and
you
will
understand
how
unanswerably
this
part
of
his
report
fixed
the
guilt
of
being
concerned
in
the
disappearance
of
the
Moonstone
on
the
memory
of
the
poor
dead
girl
.
<EOS>
Even
my
mistress
was
daunted
by
what
he
said
now
.
<EOS>
She
made
him
no
answer
when
he
had
done
.
<EOS>
It
did
n't
seem
to
matter
to
the
Sergeant
whether
he
was
answered
or
not
.
<EOS>
On
he
went
(
devil
take
him
!
)
,
just
as
steady
as
ever
.
  
<EOS>
"
Having
stated
the
whole
case
as
I
understand
it
,
"
he
said
,
"
I
have
only
to
tell
your
ladyship
,
now
,
what
I
propose
to
do
next
.
<EOS>
I
see
two
ways
of
bringing
this
inquiry
successfully
to
an
end
.
<EOS>
One
of
those
ways
I
look
upon
as
a
certainty
.
<EOS>
The
other
,
I
admit
,
is
a
bold
experiment
,
and
nothing
more
.
<EOS>
Your
ladyship
shall
decide
.
<EOS>
Shall
we
take
the
certainty
first
?
"
  
<EOS>
My
mistress
made
him
a
sign
to
take
his
own
way
,
and
choose
for
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
"
said
the
Sergeant
.
<EOS>
"
We
'll
begin
with
the
certainty
,
as
your
ladyship
is
so
good
as
to
leave
it
to
me
.
<EOS>
Whether
Miss
Verinder
remains
at
Frizinghall
,
or
whether
she
returns
here
,
I
propose
,
in
either
case
,
to
keep
a
careful
watch
on
all
her
proceedings
 
on
the
people
she
sees
,
on
the
rides
and
walks
she
may
take
,
and
on
the
letters
she
may
write
and
receive
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
next
?
"
asked
my
mistress
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
next
,
"
answered
the
Sergeant
,
"
request
your
ladyship
's
leave
to
introduce
into
the
house
,
as
a
servant
in
the
place
of
Rosanna
Spearman
,
a
woman
accustomed
to
private
inquiries
of
this
sort
,
for
whose
discretion
I
can
answer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
next
?
"
repeated
my
mistress
.
  
<EOS>
"
Next
,
"
proceeded
the
Sergeant
,
"
and
last
<EOS>
,
I
propose
to
send
one
of
my
brother
-
officers
to
make
an
arrangement
with
that
money
-
lender
in
London
,
whom
I
mentioned
just
now
as
formerly
acquainted
with
Rosanna
Spearman
 
and
whose
name
and
address
,
your
ladyship
may
rely
on
it
,
have
been
communicated
by
Rosanna
to
Miss
Verinder
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
deny
that
the
course
of
action
I
am
now
suggesting
will
cost
money
,
and
consume
time
.
<EOS>
But
the
result
is
certain
.
<EOS>
We
run
a
line
round
the
Moonstone
,
and
we
draw
that
line
closer
and
closer
till
we
find
it
in
Miss
Verinder
's
possession
,
supposing
she
decides
to
keep
it
.
<EOS>
If
her
debts
press
,
and
she
decides
on
sending
it
away
,
then
we
have
our
man
ready
,
and
we
meet
the
Moonstone
on
its
arrival
in
London
.
<EOS>
"
  
To
hear
her
own
daughter
made
the
subject
of
such
a
proposal
as
this
,
stung
my
mistress
into
speaking
angrily
for
the
first
time
.
  
<EOS>
"
Consider
your
proposal
declined
,
in
every
particular
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
And
go
on
to
your
other
way
of
bringing
the
inquiry
to
an
end
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
other
way
,
"
said
the
Sergeant
,
going
on
as
easy
as
ever
,
"
is
to
try
that
bold
experiment
to
which
I
have
alluded
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
have
formed
a
pretty
correct
estimate
of
Miss
Verinder
's
temperament
.
<EOS>
She
is
quite
capable
(
according
to
my
belief
)
of
committing
a
daring
fraud
.
<EOS>
But
she
is
too
hot
and
impetuous
in
temper
,
and
too
little
accustomed
to
deceit
as
a
habit
,
to
act
the
hypocrite
in
small
things
,
and
to
restrain
herself
under
all
provocations
.
<EOS>
Her
feelings
,
in
this
case
,
have
repeatedly
got
beyond
her
control
,
at
the
very
time
when
it
was
plainly
her
interest
to
conceal
them
.
<EOS>
It
is
on
this
peculiarity
in
her
character
that
I
now
propose
to
act
.
<EOS>
I
want
to
give
her
a
great
shock
suddenly
,
under
circumstances
that
will
touch
her
to
the
quick
.
<EOS>
In
plain
English
,
I
want
to
tell
Miss
Verinder
,
without
a
word
of
warning
,
of
Rosanna
's
death
 
on
the
chance
that
her
own
better
feelings
will
hurry
her
into
making
a
clean
breast
of
it
.
<EOS>
Does
your
ladyship
accept
that
alternative
?
"
  
<EOS>
My
mistress
astonished
me
beyond
all
power
of
expression
.
<EOS>
She
answered
him
on
the
instant
:
  
"
Yes
;
I
do
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
pony
-
chaise
is
ready
,
"
said
the
Sergeant
.
<EOS>
"
I
wish
your
ladyship
good
morning
.
"
  
<EOS>
My
lady
held
up
her
hand
,
and
stopped
him
at
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
daughter
's
better
feelings
shall
be
appealed
to
,
as
you
propose
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
claim
the
right
,
as
her
mother
,
of
putting
her
to
the
test
myself
.
<EOS>
You
will
remain
here
,
if
you
please
;
and
I
will
go
to
Frizinghall
.
"
  
<EOS>
For
once
in
his
life
,
the
great
Cuff
stood
speechless
with
amazement
,
like
an
ordinary
man
.
  
<EOS>
My
mistress
rang
the
bell
,
and
ordered
her
water
-
proof
things
.
<EOS>
It
was
still
pouring
with
rain
;
and
the
close
carriage
had
gone
,
as
you
know
,
with
Miss
Rachel
to
Frizinghall
.
<EOS>
I
tried
to
dissuade
her
ladyship
from
facing
the
severity
of
the
weather
.
<EOS>
Quite
useless
!
<EOS>
I
asked
leave
to
go
with
her
,
and
hold
the
umbrella
.
<EOS>
She
would
n't
hear
of
it
.
<EOS>
The
pony
-
chaise
came
round
,
with
the
groom
in
charge
.
<EOS>
"
You
may
rely
on
two
things
,
"
she
said
to
Sergeant
Cuff
,
in
the
hall
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
try
the
experiment
on
Miss
Verinder
as
boldly
as
you
could
try
it
yourself
.
<EOS>
And
I
will
inform
you
of
the
result
,
either
personally
or
by
letter
,
before
the
last
train
leaves
for
London
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
With
that
,
she
stepped
into
the
chaise
,
and
,
taking
the
reins
herself
,
drove
off
to
Frizinghall
.
    
<EOS>
My
mistress
having
left
us
,
I
had
leisure
to
think
of
Sergeant
Cuff
.
<EOS>
I
found
him
sitting
in
a
snug
corner
of
the
hall
,
consulting
his
memorandum
book
,
and
curling
up
viciously
at
the
corners
of
the
lips
.
  
<EOS>
"
Making
notes
of
the
case
?
"
I
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
the
Sergeant
.
<EOS>
"
Looking
to
see
what
my
next
professional
engagement
is
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
You
think
it
's
all
over
then
,
here
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
"
answered
Sergeant
Cuff
,
"
that
Lady
Verinder
is
one
of
the
cleverest
women
in
England
.
<EOS>
I
also
think
a
rose
much
better
worth
looking
at
than
a
diamond
.
<EOS>
Where
is
the
gardener
,
Mr.
Betteredge
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
no
getting
a
word
more
out
of
him
on
the
matter
of
the
Moonstone
.
<EOS>
He
had
lost
all
interest
in
his
own
inquiry
;
and
he
would
persist
in
looking
for
the
gardener
.
<EOS>
An
hour
afterwards
,
I
heard
them
at
high
words
in
the
conservatory
,
with
the
dog
-
rose
once
more
at
the
bottom
of
the
dispute
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
,
it
was
my
business
to
find
out
whether
Mr.
Franklin
persisted
in
his
resolution
to
leave
us
by
the
afternoon
train
.
<EOS>
After
having
been
informed
of
the
conference
in
my
lady
's
room
,
and
of
how
it
had
ended
,
he
immediately
decided
on
waiting
to
hear
the
news
from
Frizinghall
.
<EOS>
This
very
natural
alteration
in
his
plans
 
<EOS>
which
,
with
ordinary
people
,
would
have
led
to
nothing
in
particular
 
proved
,
in
Mr.
Franklin
's
case
,
to
have
one
objectionable
result
.
<EOS>
It
left
him
unsettled
,
with
a
legacy
of
idle
time
on
his
hands
,
and
,
in
so
doing
,
it
let
out
all
the
foreign
sides
of
his
character
,
one
on
the
top
of
another
,
like
rats
out
of
a
bag
.
  
<EOS>
Now
as
an
Italian
-
Englishman
,
now
as
a
German
-
Englishman
,
and
now
as
a
French
-
Englishman
,
he
drifted
in
and
out
of
all
the
sitting
-
rooms
in
the
house
,
with
nothing
to
talk
of
<EOS>
but
Miss
Rachel
's
treatment
of
him
;
and
with
nobody
to
address
himself
to
<EOS>
but
me
.
<EOS>
I
found
him
(
for
example
)
in
the
library
,
sitting
under
the
map
of
Modern
Italy
,
and
quite
unaware
of
any
other
method
of
meeting
his
troubles
,
except
the
method
of
talking
about
them
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
several
worthy
aspirations
,
Betteredge
;
but
what
am
I
to
do
with
them
now
?
<EOS>
I
am
full
of
dormant
good
qualities
,
if
Rachel
would
only
have
helped
me
to
bring
them
out
!
"
<EOS>
He
was
so
eloquent
in
drawing
the
picture
of
his
own
neglected
merits
,
and
so
pathetic
in
lamenting
over
it
when
it
was
done
,
that
I
felt
quite
at
my
wits
'
end
how
to
console
him
,
when
it
suddenly
occurred
to
me
that
here
was
a
case
for
the
wholesome
application
of
a
bit
of
ROBINSON
CRUSOE
.
<EOS>
I
hobbled
out
to
my
own
room
,
and
hobbled
back
with
that
immortal
book
.
<EOS>
Nobody
in
the
library
!
<EOS>
The
map
of
Modern
Italy
stared
at
ME
;
and
I
stared
at
the
map
of
Modern
Italy
.
  
<EOS>
I
tried
the
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
There
was
his
handkerchief
on
the
floor
,
to
prove
that
he
had
drifted
in
.
<EOS>
And
there
was
the
empty
room
to
prove
that
he
had
drifted
out
again
.
  
<EOS>
I
tried
the
dining
-
room
,
and
discovered
Samuel
with
a
biscuit
and
a
glass
of
sherry
,
silently
investigating
the
empty
air
.
<EOS>
A
minute
since
,
Mr.
Franklin
had
rung
furiously
for
a
little
light
refreshment
.
<EOS>
On
its
production
,
in
a
violent
hurry
,
by
Samuel
,
Mr.
Franklin
had
vanished
before
the
bell
downstairs
had
quite
done
ringing
with
the
pull
he
had
given
to
it
.
  
<EOS>
I
tried
the
morning
-
room
,
and
found
him
at
last
.
<EOS>
There
he
was
at
the
window
,
drawing
hieroglyphics
with
his
finger
in
the
damp
on
the
glass
.
  
<EOS>
"
Your
sherry
is
waiting
for
you
,
sir
,
"
I
said
to
him
.
<EOS>
I
might
as
well
have
addressed
myself
to
one
of
the
four
walls
of
the
room
;
he
was
down
in
the
bottomless
deep
of
his
own
meditations
,
past
all
pulling
up
.
<EOS>
"
How
do
YOU
explain
Rachel
's
conduct
,
Betteredge
?
"
<EOS>
was
the
only
answer
I
received
.
<EOS>
Not
being
ready
with
the
needful
reply
,
I
produced
ROBINSON
CRUSOE
,
in
which
I
am
firmly
persuaded
some
explanation
might
have
been
found
,
if
we
had
only
searched
long
enough
for
it
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Franklin
shut
up
ROBINSON
CRUSOE
,
and
floundered
into
his
German
-
English
gibberish
on
the
spot
.
<EOS>
"
Why
not
look
into
it
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
as
if
I
had
personally
objected
to
looking
into
it
.
<EOS>
"
Why
the
devil
lose
your
patience
,
Betteredge
,
when
patience
is
all
that
's
wanted
to
arrive
at
the
truth
?
<EOS>
Do
n't
interrupt
me
.
<EOS>
Rachel
's
conduct
is
perfectly
intelligible
,
if
you
will
only
do
her
the
common
justice
to
take
the
Objective
view
first
,
and
the
Subjective
view
next
,
and
the
Objective
-
Subjective
view
to
wind
up
with
.
<EOS>
What
do
we
know
?
<EOS>
We
know
that
the
loss
of
the
Moonstone
,
on
Thursday
morning
last
,
threw
her
into
a
state
of
nervous
excitement
,
from
which
she
has
not
recovered
yet
.
<EOS>
Do
you
mean
to
deny
the
Objective
view
,
so
far
?
<EOS>
Very
well
,
then
 
do
n't
interrupt
me
.
<EOS>
Now
,
being
in
a
state
of
nervous
excitement
,
how
are
we
to
expect
that
she
should
behave
as
she
might
otherwise
have
behaved
to
any
of
the
people
about
her
?
<EOS>
Arguing
in
this
way
,
from
within
-
outwards
,
what
do
we
reach
?
<EOS>
We
reach
the
Subjective
view
.
<EOS>
I
defy
you
to
controvert
the
Subjective
view
.
<EOS>
Very
well
then
 
what
follows
?
<EOS>
Good
Heavens
!
<EOS>
the
Objective
-
Subjective
explanation
follows
,
of
course
!
<EOS>
Rachel
,
properly
speaking
,
is
not
Rachel
,
but
Somebody
Else
.
<EOS>
Do
I
mind
being
cruelly
treated
by
Somebody
Else
?
<EOS>
You
are
unreasonable
enough
,
Betteredge
;
but
you
can
hardly
accuse
me
of
that
.
<EOS>
Then
how
does
it
end
?
<EOS>
It
ends
,
in
spite
of
your
confounded
English
narrowness
and
prejudice
,
in
my
being
perfectly
happy
and
comfortable
.
<EOS>
Where
's
the
sherry
?
"
  
<EOS>
My
head
was
by
this
time
in
such
a
condition
,
that
I
was
not
quite
sure
whether
it
was
my
own
head
,
or
Mr.
Franklin
's
.
<EOS>
In
this
deplorable
state
,
I
contrived
to
do
,
what
I
take
to
have
been
,
three
Objective
things
.
<EOS>
I
got
Mr.
Franklin
his
sherry
;
I
retired
to
my
own
room
;
and
I
solaced
myself
with
the
most
composing
pipe
of
tobacco
I
ever
remember
to
have
smoked
in
my
life
.
  
<EOS>
Do
n't
suppose
,
however
,
that
I
was
quit
of
Mr.
Franklin
on
such
easy
terms
as
these
.
<EOS>
Drifting
again
,
out
of
the
morning
-
room
into
the
hall
,
he
found
his
way
to
the
offices
next
,
smelt
my
pipe
,
and
was
instantly
reminded
that
he
had
been
simple
enough
to
give
up
smoking
for
Miss
Rachel
's
sake
.
<EOS>
In
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
,
he
burst
in
on
me
with
his
cigar
-
case
,
and
came
out
strong
on
the
one
everlasting
subject
,
in
his
neat
,
witty
,
unbelieving
,
French
way
.
"
<EOS>
Give
me
a
light
,
Betteredge
.
<EOS>
Is
it
conceivable
that
a
man
can
have
smoked
as
long
as
I
have
without
discovering
that
there
is
a
complete
system
for
the
treatment
of
women
at
the
bottom
of
his
cigar
-
case
?
<EOS>
Follow
me
carefully
,
and
I
will
prove
it
in
two
words
.
<EOS>
You
choose
a
cigar
,
you
try
it
,
and
it
disappoints
you
.
<EOS>
What
do
you
do
upon
that
?
<EOS>
You
throw
it
away
and
try
another
.
<EOS>
Now
observe
the
application
!
<EOS>
You
choose
a
woman
,
you
try
her
,
and
she
breaks
your
heart
.
<EOS>
Fool
!
<EOS>
take
a
lesson
from
your
cigar
-
case
.
<EOS>
Throw
her
away
,
and
try
another
!
"
  
<EOS>
I
shook
my
head
at
that
.
<EOS>
Wonderfully
clever
,
I
dare
say
,
but
my
own
experience
was
dead
against
it
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
In
the
time
of
the
late
Mrs.
Betteredge
,
"
I
said
,
"
I
felt
pretty
often
inclined
to
try
your
philosophy
,
Mr.
Franklin
.
<EOS>
But
the
law
insists
on
your
smoking
your
cigar
,
sir
,
when
you
have
once
chosen
it
.
<EOS>
"
I
pointed
that
observation
with
a
wink
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Franklin
burst
out
laughing
 
<EOS>
and
we
were
as
merry
as
crickets
,
until
the
next
new
side
of
his
character
turned
up
in
due
course
.
<EOS>
So
things
went
on
with
my
young
master
and
me
;
and
so
(
while
the
Sergeant
and
the
gardener
were
wrangling
over
the
roses
)
<EOS>
we
two
spent
the
interval
before
the
news
came
back
from
Frizinghall
.
  
<EOS>
The
pony
-
chaise
returned
a
good
half
hour
before
I
had
ventured
to
expect
it
.
<EOS>
My
lady
had
decided
to
remain
for
the
present
,
at
her
sister
's
house
.
<EOS>
The
groom
brought
two
letters
from
his
mistress
;
one
addressed
to
Mr.
Franklin
,
and
the
other
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Franklin
's
letter
I
sent
to
him
in
the
library
 
into
which
refuge
his
driftings
had
now
taken
him
for
the
second
time
.
<EOS>
My
own
letter
,
I
read
in
my
own
room
.
<EOS>
A
cheque
,
which
dropped
out
when
I
opened
it
,
informed
me
(
before
I
had
mastered
the
contents
)
that
Sergeant
Cuff
's
dismissal
from
the
inquiry
after
the
Moonstone
was
now
a
settled
thing
.
  
<EOS>
I
sent
to
the
conservatory
to
say
that
I
wished
to
speak
to
the
Sergeant
directly
.
<EOS>
He
appeared
,
with
his
mind
full
of
the
gardener
and
the
dog
-
rose
,
declaring
that
the
equal
of
Mr.
Begbie
for
obstinacy
never
had
existed
yet
,
and
never
would
exist
again
.
<EOS>
I
requested
him
to
dismiss
such
wretched
trifling
as
this
from
our
conversation
,
and
to
give
his
best
attention
to
a
really
serious
matter
.
<EOS>
Upon
that
he
exerted
himself
sufficiently
to
notice
the
letter
in
my
hand
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
in
a
weary
way
,
"
you
have
heard
from
her
ladyship
.
<EOS>
Have
I
anything
to
do
with
it
,
Mr.
Betteredge
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
shall
judge
for
yourself
,
Sergeant
.
<EOS>
"
I
thereupon
read
him
the
letter
(
with
my
best
emphasis
and
discretion
)
<EOS>
,
in
the
following
words
:
  
"
MY
GOOD
GABRIEL
,
 
I
request
that
you
will
inform
Sergeant
Cuff
,
that
I
have
performed
the
promise
I
made
to
him
;
with
this
result
,
so
far
as
Rosanna
Spearman
is
concerned
.
<EOS>
Miss
Verinder
solemnly
declares
,
that
she
has
never
spoken
a
word
in
private
to
Rosanna
,
since
that
unhappy
woman
first
entered
my
house
.
<EOS>
They
never
met
,
even
accidentally
,
on
the
night
when
the
Diamond
was
lost
;
and
no
communication
of
any
sort
whatever
took
place
between
them
,
from
the
Thursday
morning
when
the
alarm
was
first
raised
in
the
house
,
to
this
present
Saturday
afternoon
,
when
Miss
Verinder
left
us
.
<EOS>
After
telling
my
daughter
suddenly
,
and
in
so
many
words
,
of
Rosanna
Spearman
's
suicide
 
this
is
what
has
come
of
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Having
reached
that
point
,
I
looked
up
,
and
asked
Sergeant
Cuff
what
he
thought
of
the
letter
,
so
far
?
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
only
offend
you
if
I
expressed
MY
opinion
,
"
answered
the
Sergeant
.
"
<EOS>
Go
on
,
Mr.
Betteredge
,
"
he
said
,
with
the
most
exasperating
resignation
,
"
go
on
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
When
I
remembered
that
this
man
had
had
the
audacity
to
complain
of
our
gardener
's
obstinacy
,
my
tongue
itched
to
"
go
on
"
in
other
words
than
my
mistress
's
.
<EOS>
This
time
,
however
,
my
Christianity
held
firm
.
<EOS>
I
proceeded
steadily
with
her
ladyship
's
letter
:
  
"
Having
appealed
to
Miss
Verinder
in
the
manner
which
the
officer
thought
most
desirable
,
I
spoke
to
her
next
in
the
manner
which
I
myself
thought
most
likely
to
impress
her
.
<EOS>
On
two
different
occasions
,
before
my
daughter
left
my
roof
,
I
privately
warned
her
that
she
was
exposing
herself
to
suspicion
of
the
most
unendurable
and
most
degrading
kind
.
<EOS>
I
have
now
told
her
,
in
the
plainest
terms
,
that
my
apprehensions
have
been
realised
.
  
<EOS>
"
Her
answer
to
this
,
on
her
own
solemn
affirmation
,
is
as
plain
as
words
can
be
.
<EOS>
In
the
first
place
,
she
owes
no
money
privately
to
any
living
creature
.
<EOS>
In
the
second
place
,
the
Diamond
is
not
now
,
and
never
has
been
,
in
her
possession
,
since
she
put
it
into
her
cabinet
on
Wednesday
night
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
confidence
which
my
daughter
has
placed
in
me
goes
no
further
than
this
.
<EOS>
She
maintains
an
obstinate
silence
,
when
I
ask
her
if
she
can
explain
the
disappearance
of
the
Diamond
.
<EOS>
She
refuses
,
with
tears
,
when
I
appeal
to
her
to
speak
out
for
my
sake
.
<EOS>
"
The
day
will
come
when
you
will
know
why
I
am
careless
about
being
suspected
,
and
why
I
am
silent
even
to
you
.
<EOS>
I
have
done
much
to
make
my
mother
pity
me
 
nothing
to
make
my
mother
blush
for
me
.
<EOS>
"
Those
are
my
daughter
's
own
words
.
  
<EOS>
"
After
what
has
passed
between
the
officer
and
me
,
I
think
 
stranger
as
he
is
 
that
he
should
be
made
acquainted
with
what
Miss
Verinder
has
said
,
as
well
as
you
.
<EOS>
Read
my
letter
to
him
,
and
then
place
in
his
hands
the
cheque
which
I
enclose
.
<EOS>
In
resigning
all
further
claim
on
his
services
,
I
have
only
to
say
that
I
am
convinced
of
his
honesty
and
his
intelligence
;
but
I
am
more
firmly
persuaded
than
ever
,
that
the
circumstances
,
in
this
case
,
have
fatally
misled
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
the
letter
ended
.
<EOS>
Before
presenting
the
cheque
,
I
asked
Sergeant
Cuff
if
he
had
any
remark
to
make
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
no
part
of
my
duty
,
Mr.
Betteredge
,
"
he
answered
,
"
to
make
remarks
on
a
case
,
when
I
have
done
with
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
tossed
the
cheque
across
the
table
to
him
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Do
you
believe
in
THAT
part
of
her
ladyship
's
letter
?
<EOS>
"
I
said
,
indignantly
.
  
<EOS>
The
Sergeant
looked
at
the
cheque
,
and
lifted
up
his
dismal
eyebrows
in
acknowledgment
of
her
ladyship
's
liberality
.
  
<EOS>
"
This
is
such
a
generous
estimate
of
the
value
of
my
time
,
"
he
said
,
"
that
I
feel
bound
to
make
some
return
for
it
.
<EOS>
I
'll
bear
in
mind
the
amount
in
this
cheque
,
Mr.
Betteredge
,
when
the
occasion
comes
round
for
remembering
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
Her
ladyship
has
smoothed
matters
over
for
the
present
very
cleverly
,
"
said
the
Sergeant
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
THIS
family
scandal
is
of
the
sort
that
bursts
up
again
when
you
least
expect
it
.
<EOS>
We
shall
have
more
detective
-
business
on
our
hands
,
sir
,
before
the
Moonstone
is
many
months
older
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
If
those
words
meant
anything
,
and
if
the
manner
in
which
he
spoke
them
meant
anything
 
it
came
to
this
.
<EOS>
My
mistress
's
letter
had
proved
,
to
his
mind
,
that
Miss
Rachel
was
hardened
enough
to
resist
the
strongest
appeal
that
could
be
addressed
to
her
,
and
that
she
had
deceived
her
own
mother
(
good
God
,
under
what
circumstances
!
)
<EOS>
by
a
series
of
abominable
lies
.
<EOS>
How
other
people
,
in
my
place
,
might
have
replied
to
the
Sergeant
,
I
do
n't
know
.
<EOS>
I
answered
what
he
said
in
these
plain
terms
:
  
"
Sergeant
Cuff
,
I
consider
your
last
observation
as
an
insult
to
my
lady
and
her
daughter
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Betteredge
,
consider
it
as
a
warning
to
yourself
,
and
you
will
be
nearer
the
mark
.
"
  
<EOS>
Hot
and
angry
as
I
was
,
the
infernal
confidence
with
which
he
gave
me
that
answer
closed
my
lips
.
  
<EOS>
I
walked
to
the
window
to
compose
myself
.
<EOS>
The
rain
had
given
over
;
and
,
who
should
I
see
in
the
court
-
yard
,
but
Mr.
Begbie
,
the
gardener
,
waiting
outside
to
continue
the
dog
-
rose
controversy
with
Sergeant
Cuff
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
compliments
to
the
Sairgent
,
"
said
Mr.
Begbie
,
the
moment
he
set
eyes
on
me
.
<EOS>
"
If
he
's
minded
to
walk
to
the
station
,
I
'm
agreeable
to
go
with
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
!
"
cries
the
Sergeant
,
behind
me
,
"
are
you
not
convinced
yet
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
de'il
<EOS>
a
bit
I
'm
convinced
!
"
answered
Mr.
Begbie
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
I
'll
walk
to
the
station
!
"
says
the
Sergeant
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
I
'll
meet
you
at
the
gate
!
"
says
Mr.
Begbie
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
angry
enough
,
as
you
know
 
<EOS>
but
how
was
any
man
's
anger
to
hold
out
against
such
an
interruption
as
this
?
<EOS>
Sergeant
Cuff
noticed
the
change
in
me
,
and
encouraged
it
by
a
word
in
season
.
<EOS>
"
Come
!
<EOS>
come
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
"
why
not
treat
my
view
of
the
case
as
her
ladyship
treats
it
?
<EOS>
Why
not
say
,
the
circumstances
have
fatally
misled
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
To
take
anything
as
her
ladyship
took
it
was
a
privilege
worth
enjoying
 
even
with
the
disadvantage
of
its
having
been
offered
to
me
by
Sergeant
Cuff
.
<EOS>
I
cooled
slowly
down
to
my
customary
level
.
<EOS>
I
regarded
any
other
opinion
of
Miss
Rachel
,
than
my
lady
's
opinion
or
mine
,
with
a
lofty
contempt
.
<EOS>
The
only
thing
I
could
not
do
,
was
to
keep
off
the
subject
of
the
Moonstone
!
<EOS>
My
own
good
sense
ought
to
have
warned
me
,
I
know
,
to
let
the
matter
rest
 
<EOS>
but
,
there
!
<EOS>
the
virtues
which
distinguish
the
present
generation
were
not
invented
in
my
time
.
<EOS>
Sergeant
Cuff
had
hit
me
on
the
raw
,
and
,
though
I
did
look
down
upon
him
with
contempt
,
the
tender
place
still
tingled
for
all
that
.
<EOS>
The
end
of
it
was
that
I
perversely
led
him
back
to
the
subject
of
her
ladyship
's
letter
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
quite
satisfied
myself
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
But
never
mind
that
!
<EOS>
Go
on
,
as
if
I
was
still
open
to
conviction
.
<EOS>
You
think
Miss
Rachel
is
not
to
be
believed
on
her
word
;
and
you
say
we
shall
hear
of
the
Moonstone
again
.
<EOS>
Back
your
opinion
,
Sergeant
,
"
I
concluded
,
in
an
airy
way
.
<EOS>
"
Back
your
opinion
.
"
  
<EOS>
Instead
of
taking
offence
,
Sergeant
Cuff
seized
my
hand
,
and
shook
it
till
my
fingers
ached
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
declare
to
heaven
,
"
says
this
strange
officer
solemnly
,
"
I
would
take
to
domestic
service
to
-
morrow
,
Mr.
Betteredge
,
if
I
had
a
chance
of
being
employed
along
with
You
!
<EOS>
To
say
you
are
as
transparent
as
a
child
,
sir
,
is
to
pay
the
children
a
compliment
which
nine
out
of
ten
of
them
do
n't
deserve
.
<EOS>
There
!
<EOS>
there
!
<EOS>
we
wo
n't
begin
to
dispute
again
.
<EOS>
You
shall
have
it
out
of
me
on
easier
terms
than
that
.
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
say
a
word
more
about
her
ladyship
,
or
about
Miss
Verinder
 
<EOS>
I
'll
only
turn
prophet
,
for
once
in
a
way
,
and
for
your
sake
.
<EOS>
I
have
warned
you
already
that
you
have
n't
done
with
the
Moonstone
yet
.
<EOS>
Very
well
.
<EOS>
Now
I
'll
tell
you
,
at
parting
,
of
three
things
which
will
happen
in
the
future
,
and
which
,
I
believe
,
will
force
themselves
on
your
attention
,
whether
you
like
it
or
not
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Go
on
!
"
I
said
,
quite
unabashed
,
and
just
as
airy
as
ever
.
  
<EOS>
"
First
,
"
said
the
Sergeant
,
"
you
will
hear
something
from
the
Yollands
 
when
the
postman
delivers
Rosanna
's
letter
at
Cobb
's
Hole
,
on
Monday
next
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
If
he
had
thrown
a
bucket
of
cold
water
over
me
,
I
doubt
if
I
could
have
felt
it
much
more
unpleasantly
than
I
felt
those
words
.
<EOS>
Miss
Rachel
's
assertion
of
her
innocence
had
left
Rosanna
's
conduct
 
<EOS>
the
making
the
new
nightgown
,
the
hiding
the
smeared
nightgown
,
and
all
the
rest
of
it
 
entirely
without
explanation
.
<EOS>
And
this
had
never
occurred
to
me
,
till
Sergeant
Cuff
forced
it
on
my
mind
all
in
a
moment
!
  
<EOS>
"
In
the
second
place
,
"
proceeded
the
Sergeant
,
"
you
will
hear
of
the
three
Indians
again
.
<EOS>
You
will
hear
of
them
in
the
neighbourhood
,
if
Miss
Rachel
remains
in
the
neighbourhood
.
<EOS>
You
will
hear
of
them
in
London
,
if
Miss
Rachel
goes
to
London
.
"
  
<EOS>
Having
lost
all
interest
in
the
three
jugglers
,
and
having
thoroughly
convinced
myself
of
my
young
lady
's
innocence
,
I
took
this
second
prophecy
easily
enough
.
"
<EOS>
So
much
for
two
of
the
three
things
that
are
going
to
happen
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
Now
for
the
third
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Third
,
and
last
,
"
said
Sergeant
Cuff
,
"
you
will
,
sooner
or
later
,
hear
something
of
that
money
-
lender
in
London
,
whom
I
have
twice
taken
the
liberty
of
mentioning
already
.
<EOS>
Give
me
your
pocket
-
book
,
and
I
'll
make
a
note
for
you
of
his
name
and
address
 
so
that
there
may
be
no
mistake
about
it
if
the
thing
really
happens
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
wrote
accordingly
on
a
blank
leaf
 
"
Mr.
Septimus
Luker
,
Middlesex
-
place
,
Lambeth
,
London
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
,
"
he
said
,
pointing
to
the
address
,
"
are
the
last
words
,
on
the
subject
of
the
Moonstone
,
which
I
shall
trouble
you
with
for
the
present
.
<EOS>
Time
will
show
whether
I
am
right
or
wrong
.
<EOS>
In
the
meanwhile
,
sir
,
I
carry
away
with
me
a
sincere
personal
liking
for
you
,
which
I
think
does
honour
to
both
of
us
.
<EOS>
If
we
do
n't
meet
again
before
my
professional
retirement
takes
place
,
I
hope
you
will
come
and
see
me
in
a
little
house
near
London
,
which
I
have
got
my
eye
on
.
<EOS>
There
will
be
grass
walks
,
Mr.
Betteredge
,
I
promise
you
,
in
my
garden
.
<EOS>
And
as
for
the
white
moss
rose
 
"
  
"
<EOS>
The
de'il
a
bit
<EOS>
ye'll
get
the
white
moss
rose
to
grow
,
unless
you
bud
him
on
the
dogue
<EOS>
-
rose
first
,
"
cried
a
voice
at
the
window
.
  
<EOS>
We
both
turned
round
.
<EOS>
There
was
the
everlasting
Mr.
Begbie
,
too
eager
for
the
controversy
to
wait
any
longer
at
the
gate
.
<EOS>
The
Sergeant
wrung
my
hand
,
and
darted
out
into
the
court
-
yard
,
hotter
still
on
his
side
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ask
him
about
the
moss
rose
,
when
he
comes
back
,
and
see
if
I
have
left
him
a
leg
to
stand
on
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
great
Cuff
,
hailing
me
through
the
window
in
his
turn
.
<EOS>
"
Gentlemen
,
both
!
"
I
answered
,
moderating
them
again
as
I
had
moderated
them
once
already
.
  
<EOS>
"
In
the
matter
of
the
moss
rose
there
is
a
great
deal
to
be
said
on
both
sides
!
<EOS>
"
I
might
as
well
(
as
the
Irish
say
)
have
whistled
jigs
to
a
milestone
.
<EOS>
Away
they
went
together
,
fighting
the
battle
of
the
roses
without
asking
or
giving
quarter
on
either
side
.
<EOS>
The
last
I
saw
of
them
,
Mr.
Begbie
was
shaking
his
obstinate
head
,
and
Sergeant
Cuff
had
got
him
by
the
arm
like
a
prisoner
in
charge
.
<EOS>
Ah
,
well
!
<EOS>
well
!
<EOS>
I
own
<EOS>
I
could
n't
help
liking
the
Sergeant
 
though
I
hated
him
all
the
time
.
  
<EOS>
Explain
that
state
of
mind
,
if
you
can
.
<EOS>
You
will
soon
be
rid
,
now
,
of
me
and
my
contradictions
.
<EOS>
When
I
have
reported
Mr.
Franklin
's
departure
,
the
history
of
the
Saturday
's
events
will
be
finished
at
last
.
<EOS>
And
when
I
have
next
described
certain
strange
things
that
happened
in
the
course
of
the
new
week
,
I
shall
have
done
my
part
of
the
Story
,
and
shall
hand
over
the
pen
to
the
person
who
is
appointed
to
follow
my
lead
.
<EOS>
If
you
are
as
tired
of
reading
this
narrative
as
I
am
of
writing
it
 
<EOS>
Lord
,
how
we
shall
enjoy
ourselves
on
both
sides
a
few
pages
further
on
!
    
<EOS>
I
had
kept
the
pony
chaise
ready
,
in
case
Mr.
Franklin
persisted
in
leaving
us
by
the
train
that
night
.
<EOS>
The
appearance
of
the
luggage
,
followed
downstairs
by
Mr.
Franklin
himself
,
informed
me
plainly
enough
that
he
had
held
firm
to
a
resolution
for
once
in
his
life
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
you
have
really
made
up
your
mind
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
I
said
,
as
we
met
in
the
hall
.
<EOS>
"
Why
not
wait
a
day
or
two
longer
,
and
give
Miss
Rachel
another
chance
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
foreign
varnish
appeared
to
have
all
worn
off
Mr.
Franklin
,
now
that
the
time
had
come
for
saying
good
-
bye
.
<EOS>
Instead
of
replying
to
me
in
words
,
he
put
the
letter
which
her
ladyship
had
addressed
to
him
into
my
hand
.
<EOS>
The
greater
part
of
it
said
over
again
what
had
been
said
already
in
the
other
communication
received
by
me
.
<EOS>
But
there
was
a
bit
about
<EOS>
Miss
Rachel
added
at
the
end
,
which
will
account
for
the
steadiness
of
Mr.
Franklin
's
determination
,
if
it
accounts
for
nothing
else
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
wonder
,
I
dare
say
"
(
her
ladyship
wrote
)

"
at
my
allowing
my
own
daughter
to
keep
me
perfectly
in
the
dark
.
<EOS>
A
Diamond
worth
twenty
thousand
pounds
has
been
lost
 
and
I
am
left
to
infer
that
the
mystery
of
its
disappearance
is
no
mystery
to
Rachel
,
and
that
some
incomprehensible
obligation
of
silence
has
been
laid
on
her
,
by
some
person
or
persons
utterly
unknown
to
me
,
with
some
object
in
view
at
which
I
can
not
even
guess
.
<EOS>
Is
it
conceivable
that
I
should
allow
myself
to
be
trifled
with
in
this
way
?
<EOS>
It
is
quite
conceivable
,
in
Rachel
's
present
state
.
<EOS>
She
is
in
a
condition
of
nervous
agitation
pitiable
to
see
.
<EOS>
I
dare
not
approach
the
subject
of
the
Moonstone
again
until
time
has
done
something
to
quiet
her
.
<EOS>
To
help
this
end
,
I
have
not
hesitated
to
dismiss
the
police
-
officer
.
<EOS>
The
mystery
which
baffles
us
,
baffles
him
too
.
<EOS>
This
is
not
a
matter
in
which
any
stranger
can
help
us
.
<EOS>
He
adds
to
what
I
have
to
suffer
;
and
he
maddens
Rachel
if
she
only
hears
his
name
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
plans
for
the
future
are
as
well
settled
as
they
can
be
.
<EOS>
My
present
idea
is
to
take
Rachel
to
London
 
partly
to
relieve
her
mind
by
a
complete
change
,
partly
to
try
what
may
be
done
by
consulting
the
best
medical
advice
.
<EOS>
Can
I
ask
you
to
meet
us
in
town
?
<EOS>
My
dear
Franklin
,
you
,
in
your
way
,
must
imitate
my
patience
,
and
wait
,
as
I
do
,
for
a
fitter
time
.
<EOS>
The
valuable
assistance
which
you
rendered
to
the
inquiry
after
the
lost
jewel
is
still
an
unpardoned
offence
,
in
the
present
dreadful
state
of
Rachel
's
mind
.
<EOS>
Moving
blindfold
in
this
matter
,
you
have
added
to
the
burden
of
anxiety
which
she
has
had
to
bear
,
by
innocently
threatening
her
secret
with
discovery
,
through
your
exertions
.
<EOS>
It
is
impossible
for
me
to
excuse
the
perversity
that
holds
you
responsible
for
consequences
which
neither
you
nor
I
could
imagine
or
foresee
.
<EOS>
She
is
not
to
be
reasoned
with
 
she
can
only
be
pitied
.
<EOS>
I
am
grieved
to
have
to
say
it
,
but
for
the
present
,
you
and
Rachel
are
better
apart
.
<EOS>
The
only
advice
I
can
offer
you
is
,
to
give
her
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
handed
the
letter
back
,
sincerely
sorry
for
Mr.
Franklin
,
for
I
knew
how
fond
he
was
of
my
young
lady
;
and
I
saw
that
her
mother
's
account
of
her
had
cut
him
to
the
heart
.
<EOS>
"
You
know
the
proverb
,
sir
,
"
was
all
I
said
to
him
.
<EOS>
"
When
things
are
at
the
worst
,
they
're
sure
to
mend
.
<EOS>
Things
ca
n't
be
much
worse
,
Mr.
Franklin
,
than
they
are
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Franklin
folded
up
his
aunt
's
letter
,
without
appearing
to
be
much
comforted
by
the
remark
which
I
had
ventured
on
addressing
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
When
I
came
here
from
London
with
that
horrible
Diamond
,
"
he
said
,
"
I
do
n't
believe
there
was
a
happier
household
in
England
than
this
.
<EOS>
Look
at
the
household
now
!
<EOS>
Scattered
,
disunited
 
the
very
air
of
the
place
poisoned
with
mystery
and
suspicion
!
<EOS>
Do
you
remember
that
morning
at
the
Shivering
Sand
,
when
we
talked
about
my
uncle
Herncastle
,
and
his
birthday
gift
?
<EOS>
The
Moonstone
has
served
the
Colonel
's
vengeance
,
Betteredge
,
by
means
which
the
Colonel
himself
never
dreamt
of
!
"
  
<EOS>
With
that
he
shook
me
by
the
hand
,
and
went
out
to
the
pony
chaise
.
  
<EOS>
I
followed
him
down
the
steps
.
<EOS>
It
was
very
miserable
to
see
him
leaving
the
old
place
,
where
he
had
spent
the
happiest
years
of
his
life
,
in
this
way
.
<EOS>
Penelope
(
sadly
upset
by
all
that
had
happened
in
the
house
)
came
round
crying
,
to
bid
him
good
-
bye
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Franklin
kissed
her
.
<EOS>
I
waved
my
hand
as
much
as
to
say
,
"
You
're
heartily
welcome
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
Some
of
the
other
female
servants
appeared
,
peeping
after
him
round
the
corner
.
<EOS>
He
was
one
of
those
men
whom
the
women
all
like
.
<EOS>
At
the
last
moment
,
I
stopped
the
pony
chaise
,
and
begged
as
a
favour
that
he
would
let
us
hear
from
him
by
letter
.
<EOS>
He
did
n't
seem
to
heed
what
I
said
 
he
was
looking
round
from
one
thing
to
another
,
taking
a
sort
of
farewell
of
the
old
house
and
grounds
.
<EOS>
"
Tell
us
where
you
are
going
to
,
sir
!
"
<EOS>
I
said
,
holding
on
by
the
chaise
,
and
trying
to
get
at
his
future
plans
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Franklin
pulled
his
hat
down
suddenly
over
his
eyes
.
"
<EOS>
Going
?
<EOS>
"
says
he
,
echoing
the
word
after
me
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
going
to
the
devil
!
"
<EOS>
The
pony
started
at
the
word
,
as
if
he
had
felt
a
Christian
horror
of
it
.
"
<EOS>
God
bless
you
,
sir
,
go
where
you
may
!
"
was
all
I
had
time
to
say
,
before
he
was
out
of
sight
and
hearing
.
<EOS>
A
sweet
and
pleasant
gentleman
!
<EOS>
With
all
his
faults
and
follies
,
a
sweet
and
pleasant
gentleman
!
<EOS>
He
left
a
sad
gap
behind
him
,
when
he
left
my
lady
's
house
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
dull
and
dreary
enough
,
when
the
long
summer
evening
closed
in
,
on
that
Saturday
night
.
  
<EOS>
I
kept
my
spirits
from
sinking
by
sticking
fast
to
my
pipe
and
my
ROBINSON
CRUSOE
.
<EOS>
The
women
(
excepting
Penelope
)
beguiled
the
time
by
talking
of
Rosanna
's
suicide
.
<EOS>
They
were
all
obstinately
of
opinion
that
the
poor
girl
had
stolen
the
Moonstone
,
and
that
she
had
destroyed
herself
in
terror
of
being
found
out
.
<EOS>
My
daughter
,
of
course
,
privately
held
fast
to
what
she
had
said
all
along
.
<EOS>
Her
notion
of
the
motive
which
was
really
at
the
bottom
of
the
suicide
failed
,
oddly
enough
,
just
where
my
young
lady
's
assertion
of
her
innocence
failed
also
.
<EOS>
It
left
Rosanna
's
secret
journey
to
Frizinghall
,
and
Rosanna
's
proceedings
in
the
matter
of
the
nightgown
entirely
unaccounted
for
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
use
in
pointing
this
out
to
Penelope
;
the
objection
made
about
as
much
impression
on
her
as
a
shower
of
rain
on
a
waterproof
coat
.
<EOS>
The
truth
is
,
my
daughter
inherits
my
superiority
to
reason
 
and
,
in
respect
to
that
accomplishment
,
has
got
a
long
way
ahead
of
her
own
father
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
next
day
(
Sunday
)
,
the
close
carriage
,
which
had
been
kept
at
Mr.
Ablewhite
's
,
came
back
to
us
empty
.
<EOS>
The
coachman
brought
a
message
for
me
,
and
written
instructions
for
my
lady
's
own
maid
and
for
Penelope
.
  
<EOS>
The
message
informed
me
that
my
mistress
had
determined
to
take
Miss
Rachel
to
her
house
in
London
,
on
the
Monday
.
<EOS>
The
written
instructions
informed
the
two
maids
of
the
clothing
that
was
wanted
,
and
directed
them
to
meet
their
mistresses
in
town
at
a
given
hour
.
<EOS>
Most
of
the
other
servants
were
to
follow
.
<EOS>
My
lady
had
found
Miss
Rachel
so
unwilling
to
return
to
the
house
,
after
what
had
happened
in
it
,
that
she
had
decided
on
going
to
London
direct
from
Frizinghall
.
<EOS>
I
was
to
remain
in
the
country
,
until
further
orders
,
to
look
after
things
indoors
and
out
.
<EOS>
The
servants
left
with
me
were
to
be
put
on
board
wages
.
  
<EOS>
Being
reminded
,
by
all
this
,
of
what
Mr.
Franklin
had
said
about
our
being
a
scattered
and
disunited
household
,
my
mind
was
led
naturally
to
Mr.
Franklin
himself
.
<EOS>
The
more
I
thought
of
him
,
the
more
uneasy
<EOS>
I
felt
about
his
future
proceedings
.
<EOS>
It
ended
in
my
writing
,
by
the
Sunday
's
post
,
to
his
father
's
valet
,
Mr.
Jeffco
(
whom
I
had
known
in
former
years
)
to
beg
he
would
let
me
know
what
Mr.
Franklin
had
settled
to
do
,
on
arriving
in
London
.
  
<EOS>
The
Sunday
evening
was
,
if
possible
,
duller
even
than
the
Saturday
evening
.
<EOS>
We
ended
the
day
of
rest
,
as
hundreds
of
thousands
of
people
end
it
regularly
,
once
a
week
,
<EOS>
in
these
islands
 
that
is
to
say
,
we
all
anticipated
bedtime
,
and
fell
asleep
in
our
chairs
.
  
<EOS>
How
the
Monday
affected
the
rest
of
the
household
I
do
n't
know
.
<EOS>
The
Monday
gave
ME
a
good
shake
up
.
<EOS>
The
first
of
Sergeant
Cuff
's
prophecies
of
what
was
to
happen
 
namely
,
that
I
should
hear
from
the
Yollands
 
came
true
on
that
day
.
  
<EOS>
I
had
seen
Penelope
and
my
lady
's
maid
off
in
the
railway
with
the
luggage
for
London
,
and
was
pottering
about
the
grounds
,
when
I
heard
my
name
called
.
<EOS>
Turning
round
,
I
found
myself
face
to
face
with
the
fisherman
's
daughter
,
Limping
Lucy
.
<EOS>
Bating
her
lame
foot
and
her
leanness
<EOS>
(
this
last
a
horrid
draw
-
back
to
a
woman
,
in
my
opinion
)
,
the
girl
had
some
pleasing
qualities
in
the
eye
of
a
man
.
<EOS>
A
dark
,
keen
,
clever
face
,
and
a
nice
clear
voice
,
and
a
beautiful
brown
head
of
hair
counted
among
her
merits
.
<EOS>
A
crutch
appeared
in
the
list
of
her
misfortunes
.
<EOS>
And
a
temper
reckoned
high
in
the
sum
total
of
her
defects
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
my
dear
,
"
I
said
,
"
what
do
you
want
with
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Where
's
the
man
you
call
Franklin
Blake
?
"
says
the
girl
,
fixing
me
with
a
fierce
look
,
as
she
rested
herself
on
her
crutch
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
not
a
respectful
way
to
speak
of
any
gentleman
,
"
I
answered
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
wish
to
inquire
for
my
lady
's
nephew
,
you
will
please
to
mention
him
as
MR
.
<EOS>
Franklin
Blake
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
limped
a
step
nearer
to
me
,
and
looked
as
if
she
could
have
eaten
me
alive
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
MR
.
<EOS>
Franklin
Blake
?
<EOS>
"
she
repeated
after
me
.
"
<EOS>
Murderer
Franklin
Blake
would
be
a
fitter
name
for
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
My
practice
with
the
late
Mrs.
Betteredge
came
in
handy
here
.
<EOS>
Whenever
a
woman
tries
to
put
you
out
of
temper
,
turn
the
tables
,
and
put
HER
out
of
temper
instead
.
<EOS>
They
are
generally
prepared
for
every
effort
you
can
make
in
your
own
defence
,
but
that
.
<EOS>
One
word
does
it
as
well
as
a
hundred
;
and
one
word
did
it
with
Limping
Lucy
.
<EOS>
I
looked
her
pleasantly
in
the
face
;
and
I
said
 
"
Pooh
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
girl
's
temper
flamed
out
directly
.
<EOS>
She
poised
herself
on
her
sound
foot
,
and
she
took
her
crutch
,
and
beat
it
furiously
three
times
on
the
ground
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
's
a
murderer
!
<EOS>
he
's
a
murderer
!
<EOS>
he
's
a
murderer
!
<EOS>
He
has
been
the
death
of
Rosanna
Spearman
!
"
<EOS>
She
screamed
that
answer
out
at
the
top
of
her
voice
.
<EOS>
One
or
two
of
the
people
at
work
in
the
grounds
near
us
looked
up
 
saw
it
was
<EOS>
Limping
Lucy
 
knew
what
to
expect
from
that
quarter
 
and
looked
away
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
has
been
the
death
of
Rosanna
Spearman
?
<EOS>
"
I
repeated
.
<EOS>
"
What
makes
you
say
that
,
Lucy
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
care
?
<EOS>
What
does
any
man
care
?
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
if
she
had
only
thought
of
the
men
as
I
think
,
she
might
have
been
living
now
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
always
thought
kindly
of
ME
,
poor
soul
,
"
I
said
;
"
and
,
to
the
best
of
my
ability
,
I
always
tried
to
act
kindly
by
HER
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
spoke
those
words
in
as
comforting
a
manner
as
I
could
.
<EOS>
The
truth
is
,
I
had
n't
the
heart
to
irritate
the
girl
by
another
of
my
smart
replies
.
<EOS>
I
had
only
noticed
her
temper
at
first
.
<EOS>
I
noticed
her
wretchedness
now
 
<EOS>
and
wretchedness
is
not
uncommonly
insolent
<EOS>
,
you
will
find
,
in
humble
life
.
<EOS>
My
answer
melted
Limping
Lucy
.
<EOS>
She
bent
her
head
down
,
and
laid
it
on
the
top
of
her
crutch
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
loved
her
,
"
the
girl
said
softly
.
<EOS>
"
She
had
lived
a
miserable
life
,
Mr.
Betteredge
 
<EOS>
vile
people
had
ill
-
treated
her
and
led
her
wrong
 
<EOS>
and
it
had
n't
spoiled
her
sweet
temper
.
<EOS>
She
was
an
angel
.
<EOS>
She
might
have
been
happy
with
me
.
<EOS>
I
had
a
plan
for
our
going
to
London
together
like
sisters
,
and
living
by
our
needles
.
<EOS>
That
man
came
here
,
and
spoilt
it
all
.
<EOS>
He
bewitched
her
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
tell
me
he
did
n't
mean
it
,
and
did
n't
know
it
.
<EOS>
He
ought
to
have
known
it
.
<EOS>
He
ought
to
have
taken
pity
on
her
.
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
live
without
him
 
and
,
oh
,
Lucy
,
he
never
even
looks
at
me
.
<EOS>
"
That
's
what
she
said
.
<EOS>
Cruel
,
cruel
,
cruel
.
<EOS>
I
said
,
"
No
man
is
worth
fretting
for
in
that
way
.
"
<EOS>
And
she
said
,
"
There
are
men
worth
dying
for
,
Lucy
,
and
he
is
one
of
them
.
<EOS>
"
I
had
saved
up
a
little
money
.
<EOS>
I
had
settled
things
with
father
and
mother
.
<EOS>
I
meant
to
take
her
away
from
the
mortification
she
was
suffering
here
.
<EOS>
We
should
have
had
a
little
lodging
in
London
,
and
lived
together
like
sisters
.
<EOS>
She
had
a
good
education
,
sir
,
as
you
know
,
and
she
wrote
a
good
hand
.
<EOS>
She
was
quick
at
her
needle
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
good
education
,
and
I
write
a
good
hand

<EOS>
I
am
not
as
quick
at
my
needle
as
she
was
 
<EOS>
but
I
could
have
done
.
<EOS>
We
might
have
got
our
living
nicely
.
<EOS>
And
,
oh
!
<EOS>
what
happens
this
morning
?
<EOS>
what
happens
this
morning
?
<EOS>
Her
letter
comes
and
tells
me
that
she
has
done
with
the
burden
of
her
life
.
<EOS>
Her
letter
comes
,
and
bids
me
good
-
bye
for
ever
.
<EOS>
Where
is
he
?
"
<EOS>
cries
the
girl
,
lifting
her
head
from
the
crutch
,
and
flaming
out
again
through
her
tears
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Where
's
this
gentleman
that
I
must
n't
speak
of
,
except
with
respect
?
<EOS>
Ha
,
Mr.
Betteredge
,
the
day
is
not
far
off
when
the
poor
will
rise
against
the
rich
.
<EOS>
I
pray
Heaven
they
may
begin
with
HIM

<EOS>
Here
was
another
of
your
average
good
Christians
,
and
here
was
the
usual
break
-
down
,
consequent
on
that
same
average
Christianity
being
pushed
too
far
!
<EOS>
The
parson
himself
(
though
I
own
this
is
saying
a
great
deal
)
could
hardly
have
lectured
the
girl
in
the
state
she
was
in
now
.
<EOS>
All
I
ventured
to
do
was
to
keep
her
to
the
point
 
in
the
hope
of
something
turning
up
which
might
be
worth
hearing
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
want
with
Mr.
Franklin
Blake
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
see
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
For
anything
particular
?
"
  
"
I
have
got
a
letter
to
give
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
From
Rosanna
Spearman
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sent
to
you
in
your
own
letter
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
Was
the
darkness
going
to
lift
?
<EOS>
Were
all
the
discoveries
that
I
was
dying
to
make
,
coming
and
offering
themselves
to
me
of
their
own
accord
?
<EOS>
I
was
obliged
to
wait
a
moment
.
<EOS>
Sergeant
Cuff
had
left
his
infection
behind
him
.
<EOS>
Certain
signs
and
tokens
,
personal
to
myself
,
warned
me
that
the
detective
-
fever
was
beginning
to
set
in
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
ca
n't
see
Mr.
Franklin
,
"
I
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
,
and
will
,
see
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
went
to
London
last
night
.
"
  
<EOS>
Limping
Lucy
looked
me
hard
in
the
face
,
and
saw
that
I
was
speaking
the
truth
.
<EOS>
Without
a
word
more
,
she
turned
about
again
instantly
towards
Cobb
's
Hole
.
  
<EOS>
"
Stop
!
"
<EOS>
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
expect
news
of
Mr.
Franklin
Blake
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
Give
me
your
letter
,
and
I
'll
send
it
on
to
him
by
the
post
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Limping
Lucy
steadied
herself
on
her
crutch
and
looked
back
at
me
over
her
shoulder
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
to
give
it
from
my
hands
into
his
hands
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
And
I
am
to
give
it
to
him
in
no
other
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
write
,
and
tell
him
what
you
have
said
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Tell
him
I
hate
him
.
<EOS>
And
you
will
tell
him
the
truth
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
yes
.
<EOS>
But
about
the
letter
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
he
wants
the
letter
,
he
must
come
back
here
,
and
get
it
from
Me
.
"
  
<EOS>
With
those
words
she
limped
off
on
the
way
to
Cobb
's
Hole
.
<EOS>
The
detective
-
fever
burnt
up
all
my
dignity
on
the
spot
.
<EOS>
I
followed
her
,
and
tried
to
make
her
talk
.
<EOS>
All
in
vain
.
<EOS>
It
was
my
misfortune
to
be
a
man
 
and
Limping
Lucy
enjoyed
disappointing
me
.
<EOS>
Later
in
the
day
,
I
tried
my
luck
with
her
mother
.
<EOS>
Good
Mrs.
Yolland
could
only
cry
,
and
recommend
a
drop
of
comfort
out
of
the
Dutch
bottle
.
<EOS>
I
found
the
fisherman
on
the
beach
.
<EOS>
He
said
it
was
"
a
bad
job
,
"
and
went
on
mending
his
net
.
<EOS>
Neither
father
nor
mother
knew
more
than
I
knew
.
<EOS>
The
one
way
left
to
try
was
the
chance
,
which
might
come
with
the
morning
,
of
writing
to
Mr.
Franklin
Blake
.
  
<EOS>
I
leave
you
to
imagine
how
I
watched
for
the
postman
on
Tuesday
morning
.
<EOS>
He
brought
me
two
letters
.
<EOS>
One
,
from
Penelope
(
which
I
had
hardly
patience
enough
to
read
)
,
announced
that
my
lady
and
Miss
Rachel
were
safely
established
in
London
.
<EOS>
The
other
,
from
Mr.
Jeffco
,
informed
me
that
his
master
's
son
had
left
England
already
.
  
<EOS>
On
reaching
the
metropolis
,
Mr.
Franklin
had
,
it
appeared
,
gone
straight
to
his
father
's
residence
.
<EOS>
He
arrived
at
an
awkward
time
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Blake
,
the
elder
,
was
up
to
his
eyes
in
the
business
of
the
House
of
Commons
,
and
was
amusing
himself
at
home
that
night
with
the
favourite
parliamentary
plaything
which
they
call
"
a
private
bill
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Jeffco
himself
showed
Mr.
Franklin
into
his
father
's
study
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
Franklin
!
<EOS>
why
do
you
surprise
me
in
this
way
?
<EOS>
Anything
wrong
?
"
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
something
wrong
with
Rachel
;
I
am
dreadfully
distressed
about
it
.
"
<EOS>
"
Grieved
to
hear
it
.
<EOS>
But
I
ca
n't
listen
to
you
now
.
"
<EOS>
"
When
can
you
listen
?
"
<EOS>
"
My
dear
boy
!
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
deceive
you
.
<EOS>
I
can
listen
at
the
end
of
the
session
,
not
a
moment
before
.
<EOS>
Good
-
night
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
sir
.
<EOS>
Good
-
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Such
was
the
conversation
,
inside
the
study
,
as
reported
to
me
by
Mr.
Jeffco
.
<EOS>
The
conversation
outside
the
study
,
was
shorter
still
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Jeffco
,
see
what
time
the
tidal
train
starts
to
-
morrow
morning
.
"
<EOS>
"
At
six
-
forty
,
Mr.
Franklin
.
"
"
Have
me
called
at
five
.
"
<EOS>
"
Going
abroad
,
sir
?
"
<EOS>
"
Going
,
Jeffco
,
wherever
the
railway
chooses
to
take
me
.
"
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
tell
your
father
,
sir
?
"
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
tell
him
at
the
end
of
the
session
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
next
morning
Mr.
Franklin
had
started
for
foreign
parts
.
<EOS>
To
what
particular
place
he
was
bound
,
nobody
(
himself
included
)
could
presume
to
guess
.
<EOS>
We
might
hear
of
him
next
in
Europe
,
Asia
,
Africa
,
or
America
.
<EOS>
The
chances
were
as
equally
divided
as
possible
,
in
Mr.
Jeffco
's
opinion
,
among
the
four
quarters
of
the
globe
.
  
<EOS>
This
news
 
by
closing
up
all
prospects
of
my
bringing
Limping
Lucy
and
Mr.
Franklin
together
 
at
once
stopped
any
further
progress
of
mine
on
the
way
to
discovery
.
<EOS>
Penelope
's
belief
that
her
fellow
-
servant
had
destroyed
herself
through
unrequited
love
for
Mr.
Franklin
Blake
,
was
confirmed
 
and
that
was
all
.
<EOS>
Whether
the
letter
which
Rosanna
had
left
to
be
given
to
him
after
her
death
did
,
or
did
not
,
contain
the
confession
which
Mr.
Franklin
had
suspected
her
of
trying
to
make
to
him
in
her
life
-
time
,
it
was
impossible
to
say
.
<EOS>
It
might
be
only
a
farewell
word
,
telling
nothing
but
the
secret
of
her
unhappy
fancy
for
a
person
beyond
her
reach
.
<EOS>
Or
it
might
own
the
whole
truth
about
the
strange
proceedings
in
which
Sergeant
Cuff
had
detected
her
,
from
the
time
when
the
Moonstone
was
lost
,
to
the
time
when
she
rushed
to
her
own
destruction
at
the
Shivering
Sand
.
<EOS>
A
sealed
letter
it
had
been
placed
in
Limping
Lucy
's
hand
,
and
a
sealed
letter
it
remained
to
me
<EOS>
and
to
every
one
about
the
girl
,
her
own
parents
included
.
<EOS>
We
all
suspected
her
of
having
been
in
the
dead
woman
's
confidence
;
we
all
tried
to
make
her
speak
;
we
all
failed
.
<EOS>
Now
one
,
and
now
another
,
of
the
servants
 
still
holding
to
the
belief
that
Rosanna
had
stolen
the
Diamond
and
had
hidden
it
 
peered
and
poked
about
the
rocks
to
which
she
had
been
traced
,
and
peered
and
poked
in
vain
.
<EOS>
The
tide
ebbed
,
and
the
tide
flowed
;
the
summer
went
on
,
and
the
autumn
came
.
<EOS>
And
the
Quicksand
,
which
hid
her
body
,
hid
her
secret
too
.
  
<EOS>
The
news
of
Mr.
Franklin
's
departure
from
England
on
the
Sunday
morning
,
and
the
news
of
my
lady
's
arrival
in
London
with
Miss
Rachel
on
the
Monday
afternoon
,
had
reached
me
,
as
you
are
aware
,
by
the
Tuesday
's
post
.
<EOS>
The
Wednesday
came
,
and
brought
nothing
.
<EOS>
The
Thursday
produced
a
second
budget
of
news
from
Penelope
.
  
<EOS>
My
girl
's
letter
informed
me
that
some
great
London
doctor
had
been
consulted
about
her
young
lady
,
and
had
earned
a
guinea
by
remarking
that
she
had
better
be
amused
.
<EOS>
Flower
-
shows
,
operas
,
balls
 
<EOS>
there
was
a
whole
round
of
gaieties
in
prospect
;
and
Miss
Rachel
,
to
her
mother
's
astonishment
,
eagerly
took
to
it
all
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Godfrey
had
called
;
evidently
as
sweet
as
ever
on
his
cousin
,
in
spite
of
the
reception
he
had
met
with
,
when
he
tried
his
luck
on
the
occasion
of
the
birthday
.
<EOS>
To
Penelope
's
great
regret
,
he
had
been
most
graciously
received
,
and
had
added
Miss
Rachel
's
name
to
one
of
his
Ladies
'
Charities
on
the
spot
.
<EOS>
My
mistress
was
reported
to
be
out
of
spirits
,
and
to
have
held
two
long
interviews
with
her
lawyer
.
<EOS>
Certain
speculations
followed
,
referring
to
a
poor
relation
of
the
family
 
one
Miss
Clack
,
whom
I
have
mentioned
in
my
account
of
the
birthday
dinner
,
as
sitting
next
to
Mr.
Godfrey
,
and
having
a
pretty
taste
in
champagne
.
<EOS>
Penelope
was
astonished
to
find
that
Miss
Clack
had
not
called
yet
.
<EOS>
She
would
surely
not
be
long
before
she
fastened
herself
on
my
lady
as
usual
 
<EOS>
and
so
forth
,
and
so
forth
,
in
the
way
women
have
of
girding
at
each
other
,
on
and
off
paper
.
<EOS>
This
would
not
have
been
worth
mentioning
,
I
admit
,
but
for
one
reason
.
<EOS>
I
hear
you
are
likely
to
be
turned
over
to
Miss
Clack
,
after
parting
with
me
.
<EOS>
In
that
case
,
just
do
me
the
favour
of
not
believing
a
word
she
says
,
if
she
speaks
of
your
humble
servant
.
  
<EOS>
On
Friday
,
nothing
happened
 
except
that
one
of
the
dogs
showed
signs
of
a
breaking
out
behind
the
ears
.
<EOS>
I
gave
him
a
dose
of
syrup
of
buckthorn
,
and
put
him
on
a
diet
of
pot
-
liquor
and
vegetables
till
further
orders
.
<EOS>
Excuse
my
mentioning
this
.
<EOS>
It
has
slipped
in
somehow
.
<EOS>
Pass
it
over
please
.
<EOS>
I
am
fast
coming
to
the
end
of
my
offences
against
your
cultivated
modern
taste
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
the
dog
was
a
good
creature
,
and
deserved
a
good
physicking
;
he
did
indeed
.
  
<EOS>
Saturday
,
the
last
day
of
the
week
,
is
also
the
last
day
in
my
narrative
.
  
<EOS>
The
morning
's
post
brought
me
a
surprise
in
the
shape
of
a
London
newspaper
.
<EOS>
The
handwriting
on
the
direction
puzzled
me
.
<EOS>
I
compared
it
with
the
money
-
lender
's
name
and
address
as
recorded
in
my
pocket
-
book
,
and
identified
it
at
once
as
the
writing
of
Sergeant
Cuff
.
  
<EOS>
Looking
through
the
paper
eagerly
enough
,
after
this
discovery
,
I
found
an
ink
-
mark
drawn
round
one
of
the
police
reports
.
<EOS>
Here
it
is
,
at
your
service
.
<EOS>
Read
it
as
I
read
it
,
and
you
will
set
the
right
value
on
the
Sergeant
's
polite
attention
in
sending
me
the
news
of
the
day
:
  
"
LAMBETH
 
Shortly
before
the
closing
of
the
court
,
Mr.
Septimus
Luker
,
the
well
-
known
dealer
in
ancient
gems
,
carvings
,
intagli
,
&
c.
,
&
c.
,
applied
to
the
sitting
magistrate
for
advice
.
<EOS>
The
applicant
stated
that
he
had
been
annoyed
,
at
intervals
throughout
the
day
,
by
the
proceedings
of
some
of
those
strolling
Indians
who
infest
the
streets
.
<EOS>
The
persons
complained
of
were
three
in
number
.
<EOS>
After
having
been
sent
away
by
the
police
,
they
had
returned
again
and
again
,
and
had
attempted
to
enter
the
house
on
pretence
of
asking
for
charity
.
<EOS>
Warned
off
in
the
front
,
they
had
been
discovered
again
at
the
back
of
the
premises
.
<EOS>
Besides
the
annoyance
complained
of
,
Mr.
Luker
expressed
himself
as
being
under
some
apprehension
that
robbery
might
be
contemplated
.
<EOS>
His
collection
contained
many
unique
gems
,
both
classical
and
Oriental
,
of
the
highest
value
.
<EOS>
He
had
only
the
day
before
been
compelled
to
dismiss
a
skilled
workman
in
ivory
carving
from
his
employment
(
a
native
of
India
,
as
we
understood
)
,
on
suspicion
of
attempted
theft
;
and
he
felt
by
no
means
sure
that
this
man
and
the
street
jugglers
of
whom
he
complained
,
might
not
be
acting
in
concert
.
<EOS>
It
might
be
their
object
to
collect
a
crowd
,
and
create
a
disturbance
in
the
street
,
and
,
in
the
confusion
thus
caused
,
to
obtain
access
to
the
house
.

In
reply
to
the
magistrate
,
Mr.
Luker
admitted
that
he
had
no
evidence
to
produce
of
any
attempt
at
robbery
being
in
contemplation
.
<EOS>
He
could
speak
positively
to
the
annoyance
and
interruption
caused
by
the
Indians
,
but
not
to
anything
else
.
<EOS>
The
magistrate
remarked
that
,
if
the
annoyance
were
repeated
,
the
applicant
could
summon
the
Indians
to
that
court
,
where
they
might
easily
be
dealt
with
under
the
Act
.
<EOS>
As
to
the
valuables
in
Mr.
Luker
's
possession
,
Mr.
Luker
himself
must
take
the
best
measures
for
their
safe
custody
.
<EOS>
He
would
do
well
perhaps
to
communicate
with
the
police
,
and
to
adopt
such
additional
precautions
as
their
experience
might
suggest
.
<EOS>
The
applicant
thanked
his
worship
,
and
withdrew
.

<EOS>
One
of
the
wise
ancients
is
reported
(
I
forget
on
what
occasion
)
as
having
recommended
his
fellow
-
creatures
to
"
look
to
the
end
.
<EOS>

Looking
to
the
end
of
these
pages
of
mine
,
and
wondering
for
some
days
past
how
I
should
manage
to
write
it
,
I
find
my
plain
statement
of
facts
coming
to
a
conclusion
,
most
appropriately
,
of
its
own
self
.
<EOS>
We
have
gone
on
,
in
this
matter
of
the
Moonstone
,
from
one
marvel
to
another
;
and
here
we
end
with
the
greatest
marvel
of
all
 
namely
,
the
accomplishment
of
Sergeant
Cuff
's
three
predictions
in
less
than
a
week
from
the
time
when
he
had
made
them
.
  
<EOS>
After
hearing
from
the
Yollands
on
the
Monday
,
I
had
now
heard
of
the
Indians
,
and
heard
of
the
money
-
lender
,
in
the
news
from
London
 
<EOS>
Miss
Rachel
herself
remember
,
being
also
in
London
at
the
time
.
<EOS>
You
see
,
I
put
things
at
their
worst
,
even
when
they
tell
dead
against
my
own
view
.
<EOS>
If
you
desert
me
,
and
side
with
the
Sergeant
,
on
the
evidence
before
you
 
if
the
only
rational
explanation
you
can
see
is
,
that
Miss
Rachel
and
Mr.
Luker
must
have
got
together
,
and
that
the
Moonstone
must
be
now
in
pledge
in
the
money
-
lender
's
house
 
<EOS>
I
own
,
I
ca
n't
blame
you
for
arriving
at
that
conclusion
.
<EOS>
In
the
dark
,
I
have
brought
you
thus
far
.
<EOS>
In
the
dark
I
am
compelled
to
leave
you
,
with
my
best
respects
.
  
<EOS>
Why
compelled
?
<EOS>
it
may
be
asked
.
<EOS>
Why
not
take
the
persons
who
have
gone
along
with
me
,
so
far
,
up
into
those
regions
of
superior
enlightenment
in
which
I
sit
myself
?
  
<EOS>
In
answer
to
this
,
I
can
only
state
that
I
am
acting
under
orders
,
and
that
those
orders
have
been
given
to
me
(
as
I
understand
)
in
the
interests
of
truth
.
<EOS>
I
am
forbidden
to
tell
more
in
this
narrative
than
I
knew
myself
at
the
time
.
<EOS>
Or
,
to
put
it
plainer
,
I
am
to
keep
strictly
within
the
limits
of
my
own
experience
,
and
am
not
to
inform
you
of
what
other
persons
told
me
 
for
the
very
sufficient
reason
that
you
are
to
have
the
information
from
those
other
persons
themselves
,
at
first
hand
.
<EOS>
In
this
matter
of
the
Moonstone
the
plan
is
,
not
to
present
reports
,
but
to
produce
witnesses
.
<EOS>
I
picture
to
myself
a
member
of
the
family
reading
these
pages
fifty
years
hence
.
<EOS>
Lord
!
<EOS>
what
a
compliment
he
will
feel
it
,
to
be
asked
to
take
nothing
on
hear
-
say
,
and
to
be
treated
in
all
respects
like
a
Judge
on
the
bench
.
  
<EOS>
At
this
place
,
then
,
we
part
 
for
the
present
,
at
least
 
after
long
journeying
together
,
with
a
companionable
feeling
,
I
hope
,
on
both
sides
.
<EOS>
The
devil
's
dance
of
the
Indian
Diamond
has
threaded
its
way
to
London
;
and
to
London
you
must
go
after
it
,
leaving
me
at
the
country
-
house
.
<EOS>
Please
to
excuse
the
faults
of
this
composition
 
my
talking
so
much
of
myself
,
and
being
too
familiar
,
I
am
afraid
,
with
you
.
<EOS>
I
mean
no
harm
;
and
I
drink
most
respectfully
(
having
just
done
dinner
)
to
your
health
and
prosperity
,
in
a
tankard
of
her
ladyship

May
you
find
in
these
leaves
of
my
writing
,
what
ROBINSON
CRUSOE
found
in
his
experience
on
the
desert
island
 
namely
,
"
something
to
comfort
yourselves
from
,

<EOS>
SECOND
PERIOD
  
<EOS>
THE
DISCOVERY
OF
THE
TRUTH
(
1848
-
1849
)
  
<EOS>
The
events
related
in
several
narratives
.
     
<EOS>
Contributed
by
MISS
CLACK
;
niece
of
the
late
SIR
JOHN
VERINDER
   
<EOS>
I
am
indebted
to
my
dear
parents
(
both
now
in
heaven
)
for
having
had
habits
of
order
and
regularity
instilled
into
me
at
a
very
early
age
.
  
<EOS>
In
that
happy
bygone
time
,
I
was
taught
to
keep
my
hair
tidy
at
all
hours
of
the
day
and
night
,
and
to
fold
up
every
article
of
my
clothing
carefully
,
in
the
same
order
,
on
the
same
chair
,
in
the
same
place
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
,
before
retiring
to
rest
.
<EOS>
An
entry
of
the
day
's
events
in
my
little
diary
invariably
preceded
the
folding
up
.
<EOS>
The
"
Evening
Hymn
"
(
repeated
in
bed
)
invariably
followed
the
folding
up
.
<EOS>
And
the
sweet
sleep
of
childhood
invariably
followed
the
"
Evening
Hymn
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
In
later
life
(
alas
!
)
<EOS>
the
Hymn
has
been
succeeded
by
sad
and
bitter
meditations
;
and
the
sweet
sleep
has
been
but
ill
exchanged
for
the
broken
slumbers
which
haunt
the
uneasy
pillow
of
care
.
<EOS>
On
the
other
hand
,
I
have
continued
to
fold
my
clothes
,
and
to
keep
my
little
diary
.
<EOS>
The
former
habit
links
me
to
my
happy
childhood
 
before
papa
was
ruined
.
<EOS>
The
latter
habit
 
hitherto
mainly
useful
in
helping
me
to
discipline
the
fallen
nature
which
we
all
inherit
from
Adam
 
<EOS>
has
unexpectedly
proved
important
to
my
humble
interests
in
quite
another
way
.
<EOS>
It
has
enabled
poor
Me
to
serve
the
caprice
of
a
wealthy
member
of
the
family
into
which
my
late
uncle
married
.
<EOS>
I
am
fortunate
enough
to
be
useful
to
Mr.
Franklin
Blake
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
been
cut
off
from
all
news
of
my
relatives
by
marriage
for
some
time
past
.
<EOS>
When
we
are
isolated
and
poor
,
we
are
not
infrequently
forgotten
.
<EOS>
I
am
now
living
,
for
economy
's
sake
,
in
a
little
town
in
Brittany
,
inhabited
by
a
select
circle
of
serious
English
friends
,
and
possessed
of
the
inestimable
advantages
of
a
Protestant
clergyman
and
a
cheap
market
.
  
<EOS>
In
this
retirement
 
a
Patmos
amid
the
howling
ocean
of
popery
that
surrounds
us
 
a
letter
from
England
has
reached
me
at
last
.
<EOS>
I
find
my
insignificant
existence
suddenly
remembered
by
Mr.
Franklin
Blake
.
<EOS>
My
wealthy
relative
 
would
that
I
could
add
my
spiritually
-
wealthy
relative
!
 
<EOS>
writes
,
without
even
an
attempt
at
disguising
that
he
wants
something
of
me
.
<EOS>
The
whim
has
seized
him
to
stir
up
the
deplorable
scandal
of
the
Moonstone
:
and
I
am
to
help
him
by
writing
the
account
of
what
I
myself
witnessed
while
visiting
at
Aunt
Verinder
's
house
in
London
.
<EOS>
Pecuniary
remuneration
is
offered
to
me
 
with
the
want
of
feeling
peculiar
to
the
rich
.
<EOS>
I
am
to
re
-
open
wounds
that
Time
has
barely
closed
;
I
am
to
recall
the
most
intensely
painful
remembrances
 
and
this
done
,
I
am
to
feel
myself
compensated
by
a
new
laceration
,
in
the
shape
of
Mr.
Blake
's
cheque
.
<EOS>
My
nature
is
weak
.
<EOS>
It
cost
me
a
hard
struggle
,
before
Christian
humility
conquered
sinful
pride
,
and
self
-
denial
accepted
the
cheque
.
  
<EOS>
Without
my
diary
,
I
doubt
 
pray
let
me
express
it
in
the
grossest
terms
!
 
<EOS>
if
I
could
have
honestly
earned
my
money
.
<EOS>
With
my
diary
,
the
poor
labourer
(
who
forgives
Mr.
Blake
for
insulting
her
)
is
worthy
of
her
hire
.
<EOS>
Nothing
escaped
me
at
the
time
I
was
visiting
dear
Aunt
Verinder
.
<EOS>
Everything
was
entered
(
thanks
to
my
early
training
)
day
by
day
as
it
happened
;
and
everything
down
to
the
smallest
particular
,
shall
be
told
here
.
<EOS>
My
sacred
regard
for
truth
is
(
thank
God
)
far
above
my
respect
for
persons
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
easy
for
Mr.
Blake
to
suppress
what
may
not
prove
to
be
sufficiently
flattering
in
these
pages
to
the
person
chiefly
concerned
in
them
.
<EOS>
He
has
purchased
my
time
,
but
not
even
HIS
wealth
can
purchase
my
conscience
too
.

NOTE
.
<EOS>
ADDED
BY
FRANKLIN
BLAKE
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Clack
may
make
her
mind
quite
easy
on
this
point
.
<EOS>
Nothing
will
be
added
,
altered
or
removed
,
in
her
manuscript
,
or
in
any
of
the
other
manuscripts
which
pass
through
my
hands
.
<EOS>
Whatever
opinions
any
of
the
writers
may
express
,
whatever
peculiarities
of
treatment
may
mark
,
and
perhaps
in
a
literary
sense
,
disfigure
the
narratives
which
I
am
now
collecting
,
not
a
line
will
be
tampered
with
anywhere
,
from
first
to
last
.
<EOS>
As
genuine
documents
they
are
sent
to
me
 
and
as
genuine
documents
I
shall
preserve
them
,
endorsed
by
the
attestations
of
witnesses
who
can
speak
to
the
facts
.
<EOS>
It
only
remains
to
be
added
that
"
the
person
chiefly
concerned
"
in
Miss
Clack
's
narrative
,
is
happy
enough
at
the
present
moment
,
not
only
to
brave
the
smartest
exercise
of
Miss
Clack
's
pen
,
but
even
to
recognise
its
unquestionable
value
as
an
instrument
for
the
exhibition
of
Miss
Clack
's
character
.
  
<EOS>
My
diary
informs
me
,
that
I
was
accidentally
passing
Aunt
Verinder
's
house
in
Montagu
Square
,
on
Monday
,
3rd
July
,
1848
.
  
<EOS>
Seeing
the
shutters
opened
,
and
the
blinds
drawn
up
,
I
felt
that
it
would
be
an
act
of
polite
attention
to
knock
,
and
make
inquiries
.
<EOS>
The
person
who
answered
the
door
,
informed
me
that
my
aunt
and
her
daughter
(
I
really
can
not
call
her
my
cousin
!
)
<EOS>
had
arrived
from
the
country
a
week
since
,
and
meditated
making
some
stay
in
London
.
<EOS>
I
sent
up
a
message
at
once
,
declining
to
disturb
them
,
and
only
begging
to
know
whether
I
could
be
of
any
use
.
  
<EOS>
The
person
who
answered
the
door
,
took
my
message
in
insolent
silence
,
and
left
me
standing
in
the
hall
.
<EOS>
She
is
the
daughter
of
a
heathen
old
man
named
Betteredge
 
long
,
too
long
,
tolerated
in
my
aunt
's
family
.
<EOS>
I
sat
down
in
the
hall
to
wait
for
my
answer
 
and
,
having
always
a
few
tracts
in
my
bag
,
I
selected
one
which
proved
to
be
quite
providentially
applicable
to
the
person
who
answered
the
door
.
<EOS>
The
hall
was
dirty
,
and
the
chair
was
hard
;
but
the
blessed
consciousness
of
returning
good
for
evil
raised
me
quite
above
any
trifling
considerations
of
that
kind
.
<EOS>
The
tract
was
one
of
a
series
addressed
to
young
women
on
the
sinfulness
of
dress
.
<EOS>
In
style
it
was
devoutly
familiar
.
<EOS>
Its
title
was
,
"
A
Word
With
You
On
Your
Cap
-
Ribbons
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
lady
is
much
obliged
,
and
begs
you
will
come
and
lunch
to
-
morrow
at
two
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
passed
over
the
manner
in
which
she
gave
her
message
,
and
the
dreadful
boldness
of
her
look
.
<EOS>
I
thanked
this
young
castaway
;
and
I
said
,
in
a
tone
of
Christian
interest
,
"
Will
you
favour
me
by
accepting
a
tract
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
looked
at
the
title
.
<EOS>
"
Is
it
written
by
a
man
or
a
woman
,
Miss
?
<EOS>
If
it
's
written
by
a
woman
,
I
had
rather
not
read
it
on
that
account
.
<EOS>
If
it
's
written
by
a
man
,
I
beg
to
inform
him
that
he
knows
nothing
about
it
.
"
<EOS>
She
handed
me
back
the
tract
,
and
opened
the
door
.
<EOS>
We
must
sow
the
good
seed
somehow
.
<EOS>
I
waited
till
the
door
was
shut
on
me
,
and
slipped
the
tract
into
the
letter
-
box
.
<EOS>
When
I
had
dropped
another
tract
through
the
area
railings
,
I
felt
relieved
,
in
some
small
degree
,
of
a
heavy
responsibility
towards
others
.
  
<EOS>
We
had
a
meeting
that
evening
of
the
Select
Committee
of
the
Mothers'-Small
-
Clothes
-
Conversion
-
Society
.
<EOS>
The
object
of
this
excellent
Charity
is
 
as
all
serious
people
know
 
to
rescue
unredeemed
fathers
'
trousers
from
the
pawnbroker
,
and
to
prevent
their
resumption
,
on
the
part
of
the
irreclaimable
parent
,
by
abridging
them
immediately
to
suit
the
proportions
of
the
innocent
son
.
<EOS>
I
was
a
member
,
at
that
time
,
of
the
select
committee
;
and
I
mention
the
Society
here
,
because
my
precious
and
admirable
friend
,
Mr.
Godfrey
Ablewhite
,
was
associated
with
our
work
of
moral
and
material
usefulness
.
<EOS>
I
had
expected
to
see
him
in
the
boardroom
,
on
the
Monday
evening
of
which
I
am
now
writing
,
and
had
proposed
to
tell
him
,
when
we
met
,
of
dear
Aunt
Verinder
's
arrival
in
London
.
<EOS>
To
my
great
disappointment
he
never
appeared
.
<EOS>
On
my
expressing
a
feeling
of
surprise
at
his
absence
,
my
sisters
of
the
Committee
all
looked
up
together
from
their
trousers
(
we
had
a
great
pressure
of
business
that
night
)
,
and
asked
in
amazement
,
if
I
had
not
heard
the
news
.
<EOS>
I
acknowledged
my
ignorance
,
and
was
then
told
,
for
the
first
time
,
of
an
event
which
forms
,
so
to
speak
,
the
starting
-
point
of
this
narrative
.
<EOS>
On
the
previous
Friday
,
two
gentlemen
 
occupying
widely
-
different
positions
in
society
 
had
been
the
victims
of
an
outrage
which
had
startled
all
London
.
<EOS>
One
of
the
gentlemen
was
Mr.
Septimus
Luker
,
of
Lambeth
.
<EOS>
The
other
was
Mr.
Godfrey
Ablewhite
.
  
<EOS>
Living
in
my
present
isolation
,
I
have
no
means
of
introducing
the
newspaper
-
account
of
the
outrage
into
my
narrative
.
<EOS>
I
was
also
deprived
,
at
the
time
,
of
the
inestimable
advantage
of
hearing
the
events
related
by
the
fervid
eloquence
of
Mr.
Godfrey
Ablewhite
.
<EOS>
All
I
can
do
is
to
state
the
facts
as
they
were
stated
,
on
that
Monday
evening
,
to
me
;
proceeding
on
the
plan
which
I
have
been
taught
from
infancy
to
adopt
in
folding
up
my
clothes
.
<EOS>
Everything
shall
be
put
neatly
,
and
everything
shall
be
put
in
its
place
.
<EOS>
These
lines
are
written
by
a
poor
weak
woman
.
<EOS>
From
a
poor
weak
woman
who
will
be
cruel
enough
to
expect
more
?
  
<EOS>
The
date
 
<EOS>
thanks
to
my
dear
parents
,
no
dictionary
that
ever
was
written
can
be
more
particular
than
I
am
about
dates
 
<EOS>
was
Friday
,
June
30th
,
1848
.
  
<EOS>
Early
on
that
memorable
day
,
our
gifted
Mr.
Godfrey
happened
to
be
cashing
a
cheque
at
a
banking
-
house
in
Lombard
Street
.
<EOS>
The
name
of
the
firm
is
accidentally
blotted
in
my
diary
,
and
my
sacred
regard
for
truth
forbids
me
to
hazard
a
guess
in
a
matter
of
this
kind
.
<EOS>
Fortunately
,
the
name
of
the
firm
does
n't
matter
.
<EOS>
What
does
matter
is
a
circumstance
that
occurred
when
Mr.
Godfrey
had
transacted
his
business
.
<EOS>
On
gaining
the
door
,
he
encountered
a
gentleman
 
a
perfect
stranger
to
him
 
who
was
accidentally
leaving
the
office
exactly
at
the
same
time
as
himself
.
<EOS>
A
momentary
contest
of
politeness
ensued
between
them
as
to
who
should
be
the
first
to
pass
through
the
door
of
the
bank
.
<EOS>
The
stranger
insisted
on
making
Mr.
Godfrey
precede
him
;
Mr.
Godfrey
said
a
few
civil
words
;
they
bowed
,
and
parted
in
the
street
.
  
<EOS>
Thoughtless
and
superficial
people
may
say
,
Here
is
surely
a
very
trumpery
little
incident
related
in
an
absurdly
circumstantial
manner
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
my
young
friends
and
fellow
-
sinners
!
<EOS>
beware
of
presuming
to
exercise
your
poor
carnal
reason
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
be
morally
tidy
.
<EOS>
Let
your
faith
be
as
your
stockings
,
and
your
stockings
as
your
faith
.
<EOS>
Both
ever
spotless
,
and
both
ready
to
put
on
at
a
moment
's
notice
!
  
<EOS>
I
beg
a
thousand
pardons
.
<EOS>
I
have
fallen
insensibly
into
my
Sunday
-
school
style
.
<EOS>
Most
inappropriate
in
such
a
record
as
this
.
<EOS>
Let
me
try
to
be
worldly
 
<EOS>
let
me
say
that
trifles
,
in
this
case
as
in
many
others
,
led
to
terrible
results
.
<EOS>
Merely
premising
that
the
polite
stranger
was
Mr.
Luker
,
of
Lambeth
,
we
will
now
follow
Mr.
Godfrey
home
to
his
residence
at
Kilburn
.
  
<EOS>
He
found
waiting
for
him
,
in
the
hall
,
a
poorly
clad
but
delicate
and
interesting
-
looking
little
boy
.
<EOS>
The
boy
handed
him
a
letter
,
merely
mentioning
that
he
had
been
entrusted
with
it
by
an
old
lady
whom
he
did
not
know
,
and
who
had
given
him
no
instructions
to
wait
for
an
answer
.
<EOS>
Such
incidents
as
these
were
not
uncommon
in
Mr.
Godfrey
's
large
experience
as
a
promoter
of
public
charities
.
<EOS>
He
let
the
boy
go
,
and
opened
the
letter
.
  
<EOS>
The
handwriting
was
entirely
unfamiliar
to
him
.
<EOS>
It
requested
his
attendance
,
within
an
hour
's
time
,
at
a
house
in
Northumberland
Street
,
Strand
,
which
he
had
never
had
occasion
to
enter
before
.
<EOS>
The
object
sought
was
to
obtain
from
the
worthy
manager
certain
details
on
the
subject
of
the
Mothers'-Small
-
Clothes
-
Conversion
-
Society
,
and
the
information
was
wanted
by
an
elderly
lady
who
proposed
adding
largely
to
the
resources
of
the
charity
,
if
her
questions
were
met
by
satisfactory
replies
.
<EOS>
She
mentioned
her
name
,
and
she
added
that
the
shortness
of
her
stay
in
London
prevented
her
from
giving
any
longer
notice
to
the
eminent
philanthropist
whom
she
addressed
.
  
<EOS>
Ordinary
people
might
have
hesitated
before
setting
aside
their
own
engagements
to
suit
the
convenience
of
a
stranger
.
<EOS>
The
Christian
Hero
never
hesitates
where
good
is
to
be
done
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Godfrey
instantly
turned
back
,
and
proceeded
to
the
house
in
Northumberland
Street
.
<EOS>
A
most
respectable
though
somewhat
corpulent
man
answered
the
door
,
and
,
on
hearing
Mr.
Godfrey
's
name
,
immediately
conducted
him
into
an
empty
apartment
at
the
back
,
on
the
drawing
-
room
floor
.
<EOS>
He
noticed
two
unusual
things
on
entering
the
room
.
<EOS>
One
of
them
was
a
faint
odour
of
musk
and
camphor
.
<EOS>
The
other
was
an
ancient
Oriental
manuscript
,
richly
illuminated
with
Indian
figures
and
devices
,
that
lay
open
to
inspection
on
a
table
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
looking
at
the
book
,
the
position
of
which
caused
him
to
stand
with
his
back
turned
towards
the
closed
folding
doors
communicating
with
the
front
room
,
when
,
without
the
slightest
previous
noise
to
warn
him
,
he
felt
himself
suddenly
seized
round
the
neck
from
behind
.
<EOS>
He
had
just
time
to
notice
that
the
arm
round
his
neck
<EOS>
was
naked
and
of
a
tawny
-
brown
colour
,
before
his
eyes
were
bandaged
,
his
mouth
was
gagged
,
and
he
was
thrown
helpless
on
the
floor
by
(
as
he
judged
)
two
men
.
<EOS>
A
third
rifled
his
pockets
,
and
 
if
,
as
a
lady
,
I
may
venture
to
use
such
an
expression
 
<EOS>
searched
him
,
without
ceremony
,
through
and
through
to
his
skin
.
  
<EOS>
Here
I
should
greatly
enjoy
saying
a
few
cheering
words
on
the
devout
confidence
which
could
alone
have
sustained
Mr.
Godfrey
in
an
emergency
so
terrible
as
this
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
,
however
,
the
position
and
appearance
of
my
admirable
friend
at
the
culminating
period
of
the
outrage
(
as
above
described
)
are
hardly
within
the
proper
limits
of
female
discussion
.
<EOS>
Let
me
pass
over
the
next
few
moments
,
and
return
to
Mr.
Godfrey
at
the
time
when
the
odious
search
of
his
person
had
been
completed
.
<EOS>
The
outrage
had
been
perpetrated
throughout
in
dead
silence
.
<EOS>
At
the
end
of
it
some
words
were
exchanged
,
among
the
invisible
wretches
,
in
a
language
which
he
did
not
understand
,
but
in
tones
which
were
plainly
expressive
(
to
his
cultivated
ear
)
of
disappointment
and
rage
.
<EOS>
He
was
suddenly
lifted
from
the
ground
,
placed
in
a
chair
,
and
bound
there
hand
and
foot
.
<EOS>
The
next
moment
he
felt
the
air
flowing
in
from
the
open
door
,
listened
,
and
concluded
that
he
was
alone
again
in
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
An
interval
elapsed
,
and
he
heard
a
sound
below
like
the
rustling
sound
of
a
woman
's
dress
.
<EOS>
It
advanced
up
the
stairs
,
and
stopped
.
<EOS>
A
female
scream
rent
the
atmosphere
of
guilt
.
<EOS>
A
man
's
voice
below
exclaimed
"
Hullo
!
"
<EOS>
A
man
's
feet
ascended
the
stairs
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Godfrey
felt
Christian
fingers
unfastening
his
bandage
,
and
extracting
his
gag
.
<EOS>
He
looked
in
amazement
at
two
respectable
strangers
,
and
faintly
articulated
,
"
What
does
it
mean
?
<EOS>
"
The
two
respectable
strangers
looked
back
,
and
said
,
"
Exactly
the
question
we
were
going
to
ask
YOU
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
inevitable
explanation
followed
.
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
Let
me
be
scrupulously
particular
.
<EOS>
Sal
volatile
and
water
followed
,
to
compose
dear
Mr.
Godfrey
's
nerves
.
<EOS>
The
explanation
came
next
.
  
<EOS>
It
appeared
from
the
statement
of
the
landlord
and
landlady
of
the
house
(
persons
of
good
repute
in
the
neighbourhood
)
,
that
their
first
and
second
floor
apartments
had
been
engaged
,
on
the
previous
day
,
for
a
week
certain
,
by
a
most
respectable
-
looking
gentleman
 
the
same
who
has
been
already
described
as
answering
the
door
to
Mr.
Godfrey
's
knock
.
<EOS>
The
gentleman
had
paid
the
week
's
rent
and
all
the
week
's
extras
in
advance
,
stating
that
the
apartments
were
wanted
for
three
Oriental
noblemen
,
friends
of
his
,
who
were
visiting
England
for
the
first
time
.
<EOS>
Early
on
the
morning
of
the
outrage
,
two
of
the
Oriental
strangers
,
accompanied
by
their
respectable
English
friend
,
took
possession
of
the
apartments
.
<EOS>
The
third
was
expected
to
join
them
shortly
;
and
the
luggage
(
reported
as
very
bulky
)
was
announced
to
follow
when
it
had
passed
through
the
Custom
-
house
,
late
in
the
afternoon
.
<EOS>
Not
more
than
ten
minutes
previous
to
Mr.
Godfrey
's
visit
,
the
third
foreigner
had
arrived
.
<EOS>
Nothing
out
of
the
common
had
happened
,
to
the
knowledge
of
the
landlord
and
landlady
down
-
stairs
,
until
within
the
last
five
minutes
 
when
they
had
seen
the
three
foreigners
,
accompanied
by
their
respectable
English
friend
,
all
leave
the
house
together
,
walking
quietly
in
the
direction
of
the
Strand
.
<EOS>
Remembering
that
a
visitor
had
called
,
and
not
having
seen
the
visitor
also
leave
the
house
,
the
landlady
had
thought
it
rather
strange
that
the
gentleman
should
be
left
by
himself
up
-
stairs
.
<EOS>
After
a
short
discussion
with
her
husband
,
she
had
considered
it
advisable
to
ascertain
whether
anything
was
wrong
.
<EOS>
The
result
had
followed
,
as
I
have
already
attempted
to
describe
it
;
and
there
the
explanation
of
the
landlord
and
the
landlady
came
to
an
end
.
  
<EOS>
An
investigation
was
next
made
in
the
room
.
<EOS>
Dear
Mr.
Godfrey
's
property
was
found
scattered
in
all
directions
.
<EOS>
When
the
articles
were
collected
,
however
,
nothing
was
missing
;
his
watch
,
chain
,
purse
,
keys
,
pocket
-
handkerchief
,
note
-
book
,
and
all
his
loose
papers
had
been
closely
examined
,
and
had
then
been
left
unharmed
to
be
resumed
by
the
owner
.
<EOS>
In
the
same
way
,
not
the
smallest
morsel
of
property
belonging
to
the
proprietors
of
the
house
had
been
abstracted
.
<EOS>
The
Oriental
noblemen
had
removed
their
own
illuminated
manuscript
,
and
had
removed
nothing
else
.
  
<EOS>
What
did
it
mean
?
<EOS>
Taking
the
worldly
point
of
view
,
it
appeared
to
mean
that
Mr.
Godfrey
had
been
the
victim
of
some
incomprehensible
error
,
committed
by
certain
unknown
men
.
<EOS>
A
dark
conspiracy
was
on
foot
in
the
midst
of
us
;
and
our
beloved
and
innocent
friend
had
been
entangled
in
its
meshes
.
<EOS>
When
the
Christian
hero
of
a
hundred
charitable
victories
plunges
into
a
pitfall
that
has
been
dug
for
him
by
mistake
,
oh
,
what
a
warning
<EOS>
it
is
to
the
rest
of
us
to
be
unceasingly
on
our
guard
!
<EOS>
How
soon
may
our
own
evil
passions
prove
to
be
Oriental
noblemen
who
pounce
on
us
unawares
!
  
<EOS>
I
could
write
pages
of
affectionate
warning
on
this
one
theme
,
but
(
alas
!
)
<EOS>
I
am
not
permitted
to
improve
 
I
am
condemned
to
narrate
.
<EOS>
My
wealthy
relative
's
cheque
 
<EOS>
henceforth
,
the
incubus
of
my
existence
 
warns
me
that
I
have
not
done
with
this
record
of
violence
yet
.
<EOS>
We
must
leave
Mr.
Godfrey
to
recover
in
Northumberland
Street
,
and
must
follow
the
proceedings
of
Mr.
Luker
at
a
later
period
of
the
day
.
  
<EOS>
After
leaving
the
bank
,
Mr.
Luker
had
visited
various
parts
of
London
on
business
errands
.
<EOS>
Returning
to
his
own
residence
,
he
found
a
letter
waiting
for
him
,
which
was
described
as
having
been
left
a
short
time
previously
by
a
boy
.
<EOS>
In
this
case
,
as
in
Mr.
Godfrey
's
case
,
the
handwriting
was
strange
;
but
the
name
mentioned
was
the
name
of
one
of
Mr.
Luker
's
customers
.
<EOS>
His
correspondent
announced
(
writing
in
the
third
person
 
apparently
by
the
hand
of
a
deputy
)
that
he
had
been
unexpectedly
summoned
to
London
.
<EOS>
He
had
just
established
himself
in
lodgings
in
Alfred
Place
,
Tottenham
Court
Road
;
and
he
desired
to
see
Mr.
Luker
immediately
,
on
the
subject
of
a
purchase
which
he
contemplated
making
.
<EOS>
The
gentleman
was
an
enthusiastic
collector
of
Oriental
antiquities
,
and
had
been
for
many
years
a
liberal
patron
of
the
establishment
in
Lambeth
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
when
shall
we
wean
ourselves
from
the
worship
of
Mammon
!
<EOS>
Mr.
Luker
called
a
cab
,
and
drove
off
instantly
to
his
liberal
patron
.
  
<EOS>
Exactly
what
had
happened
to
Mr.
Godfrey
in
Northumberland
Street
now
happened
to
Mr.
Luker
in
Alfred
Place
.
<EOS>
Once
more
the
respectable
man
answered
the
door
,
and
showed
the
visitor
up
-
stairs
into
the
back
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
There
,
again
,
lay
the
illuminated
manuscript
on
a
table
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Luker
's
attention
was
absorbed
,
as
Mr.
Godfrey
's
attention
had
been
absorbed
,
by
this
beautiful
work
of
Indian
art
.
<EOS>
He
too
was
aroused
from
his
studies
by
a
tawny
naked
arm
round
his
throat
,
by
a
bandage
over
his
eyes
,
and
by
a
gag
in
his
mouth
.
<EOS>
He
too
was
thrown
prostrate
and
searched
to
the
skin
.
<EOS>
A
longer
interval
had
then
elapsed
than
had
passed
in
the
experience
of
Mr.
Godfrey
;
but
it
had
ended
as
before
,
in
the
persons
of
the
house
suspecting
something
wrong
,
and
going
up
-
stairs
to
see
what
had
happened
.
<EOS>
Precisely
the
same
explanation
which
the
landlord
in
Northumberland
Street
had
given
to
Mr.
Godfrey
,
the
landlord
in
Alfred
Place
now
gave
to
Mr.
Luker
.
<EOS>
Both
had
been
imposed
on
in
the
same
way
by
the
plausible
address
and
well
-
filled
purse
of
the
respectable
stranger
,
who
introduced
himself
as
acting
for
his
foreign
friends
.
<EOS>
The
one
point
of
difference
between
the
two
cases
occurred
when
the
scattered
contents
of
Mr.
Luker
's
pockets
were
being
collected
from
the
floor
.
<EOS>
His
watch
and
purse
were
safe
,
but
(
less
fortunate
than
Mr.
Godfrey
)
<EOS>
one
of
the
loose
papers
that
he
carried
about
him
had
been
taken
away
.
<EOS>
The
paper
in
question
acknowledged
the
receipt
of
a
valuable
of
great
price
which
Mr.
Luker
had
that
day
left
in
the
care
of
his
bankers
.
<EOS>
This
document
would
be
useless
for
purposes
of
fraud
,
inasmuch
as
it
provided
that
the
valuable
should
only
be
given
up
on
the
personal
application
of
the
owner
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
he
recovered
himself
,
Mr.
Luker
hurried
to
the
bank
,
on
the
chance
that
the
thieves
who
had
robbed
him
might
ignorantly
present
themselves
with
the
receipt
.
<EOS>
Nothing
had
been
seen
of
them
when
he
arrived
at
the
establishment
,
and
nothing
was
seen
of
them
afterwards
.
<EOS>
Their
respectable
English
friend
had
(
in
the
opinion
of
the
bankers
)
looked
the
receipt
over
before
they
attempted
to
make
use
of
it
,
and
had
given
them
the
necessary
warning
in
good
time
.
  
<EOS>
Information
of
both
outrages
was
communicated
to
the
police
,
and
the
needful
investigations
were
pursued
,
I
believe
,
with
great
energy
.
<EOS>
The
authorities
held
that
a
robbery
had
been
planned
,
on
insufficient
information
received
by
the
thieves
.
<EOS>
They
had
been
plainly
not
sure
whether
Mr.
Luker
had
,
or
had
not
,
trusted
the
transmission
of
his
precious
gem
to
another
person
;
and
poor
polite
Mr.
Godfrey
had
paid
the
penalty
of
having
been
seen
accidentally
speaking
to
him
.
<EOS>
Add
to
this
,
that
Mr.
Godfrey
's
absence
from
our
Monday
evening
meeting
had
been
occasioned
by
a
consultation
of
the
authorities
,
at
which
he
was
requested
to
assist
 
and
all
the
explanations
required
being
now
given
,
I
may
proceed
with
the
simpler
story
of
my
own
little
personal
experiences
in
Montagu
Square
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
punctual
to
the
luncheon
hour
on
Tuesday
.
<EOS>
Reference
to
my
diary
shows
this
to
have
been
a
chequered
day
 
much
in
it
to
be
devoutly
regretted
,
much
in
it
to
be
devoutly
thankful
for
.
  
<EOS>
Dear
Aunt
Verinder
received
me
with
her
usual
grace
and
kindness
.
<EOS>
But
I
noticed
,
after
a
little
while
,
that
something
was
wrong
.
<EOS>
Certain
anxious
looks
escaped
my
aunt
,
all
of
which
took
the
direction
of
her
daughter
.
<EOS>
I
never
see
Rachel
myself
without
wondering
how
it
can
be
that
so
insignificant
-
looking
a
person
should
be
the
child
of
such
distinguished
parents
as
Sir
John
and
Lady
Verinder
.
<EOS>
On
this
occasion
,
however
,
she
not
only
disappointed
 
she
really
shocked
me
.
<EOS>
There
was
an
absence
of
all
lady
-
like
restraint
in
her
language
and
manner
most
painful
to
see
.
<EOS>
She
was
possessed
by
some
feverish
excitement
which
made
her
distressingly
loud
when
she
laughed
,
and
sinfully
wasteful
and
capricious
in
what
she
ate
and
drank
at
lunch
.
<EOS>
I
felt
deeply
for
her
poor
mother
,
even
before
the
true
state
of
the
case
had
been
confidentially
made
known
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
Luncheon
over
,
my
aunt
said
:
"
Remember
what
the
doctor
told
you
,
Rachel
,
about
quieting
yourself
with
a
book
after
taking
your
meals
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
go
into
the
library
,
mamma
,
"
she
answered
.
<EOS>
"
But
if
Godfrey
calls
,
mind
I
am
told
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
am
dying
for
more
news
of
him
,
after
his
adventure
in
Northumberland
Street
.
"
<EOS>
She
kissed
her
mother
on
the
forehead
,
and
looked
my
way
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Good
-
bye
,
Clack
,
"
she
said
,
carelessly
.
<EOS>
Her
insolence
roused
no
angry
feeling
in
me
;
I
only
made
a
private
memorandum
to
pray
for
her
.
  
<EOS>
When
we
were
left
by
ourselves
,
my
aunt
told
me
the
whole
horrible
story
of
the
Indian
Diamond
,
which
,
I
am
happy
to
know
<EOS>
,
it
is
not
necessary
to
repeat
here
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
conceal
from
me
that
she
would
have
preferred
keeping
silence
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
But
when
her
own
servants
all
knew
of
the
loss
of
the
Moonstone
,
and
when
some
of
the
circumstances
had
actually
found
their
way
into
the
newspapers
 
when
strangers
were
speculating
whether
there
was
any
connection
between
what
had
happened
at
Lady
Verinder
's
country
-
house
,
and
what
had
happened
in
Northumberland
Street
and
Alfred
Place
 
concealment
was
not
to
be
thought
of
;
and
perfect
frankness
became
a
necessity
as
well
as
a
virtue
.
  
<EOS>
Some
persons
,
hearing
what
I
now
heard
,
would
have
been
probably
overwhelmed
with
astonishment
.
<EOS>
For
my
own
part
,
knowing
Rachel
's
spirit
to
have
been
essentially
unregenerate
from
her
childhood
upwards
,
I
was
prepared
for
whatever
my
aunt
could
tell
me
on
the
subject
of
her
daughter
.
<EOS>
It
might
have
gone
on
from
bad
to
worse
till
it
ended
in
Murder
;
and
I
should
still
have
said
to
myself
,
The
natural
result
!
<EOS>
oh
,
dear
,
dear
,
the
natural
result
!
<EOS>
The
one
thing
that
DID
shock
me
was
the
course
my
aunt
had
taken
under
the
circumstances
.
<EOS>
Here
surely
was
a
case
for
a
clergyman
,
if
ever
there
was
one
yet
!
<EOS>
Lady
Verinder
had
thought
it
a
case
for
a
physician
.
<EOS>
All
my
poor
aunt
's
early
life
had
been
passed
in
her
father
's
godless
household
.
<EOS>
The
natural
result
again
!
<EOS>
Oh
,
dear
,
dear
,
the
natural
result
again
!
  
<EOS>
"
The
doctors
recommend
plenty
of
exercise
and
amusement
for
Rachel
,
and
strongly
urge
me
to
keep
her
mind
as
much
as
possible
from
dwelling
on
the
past
,
"
said
Lady
Verinder
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
what
heathen
advice
!
<EOS>
"
I
thought
to
myself
.
"
<EOS>
In
this
Christian
country
,
what
heathen
advice
!
"
  
<EOS>
My
aunt
went
on
,
"
I
do
my
best
to
carry
out
my
instructions
.
<EOS>
But
this
strange
adventure
of
Godfrey
's
happens
at
a
most
unfortunate
time
.
<EOS>
Rachel
has
been
incessantly
restless
and
excited
since
she
first
heard
of
it
.
<EOS>
She
left
me
no
peace
till
I
had
written
and
asked
my
nephew
Ablewhite
to
come
here
.
<EOS>
She
even
feels
an
interest
in
the
other
person
who
was
roughly
used
 
Mr.
Luker
,
or
some
such
name
 
though
the
man
is
,
of
course
,
a
total
stranger
to
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Your
knowledge
of
the
world
,
dear
aunt
,
is
superior
to
mine
,
"
I
suggested
diffidently
.
"
<EOS>
But
there
must
be
a
reason
surely
for
this
extraordinary
conduct
on
Rachel
's
part
.
<EOS>
She
is
keeping
a
sinful
secret
from
you
and
from
everybody
.
<EOS>
May
there
not
be
something
in
these
recent
events
which
threatens
her
secret
with
discovery
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Discovery
?
"
repeated
my
aunt
.
<EOS>
"
What
can
you
possibly
mean
?
<EOS>
Discovery
through
Mr.
Luker
?
<EOS>
Discovery
through
my
nephew
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
As
the
word
passed
her
lips
,
a
special
providence
occurred
.
<EOS>
The
servant
opened
the
door
,
and
announced
Mr.
Godfrey
Ablewhite
.
    
<EOS>
Mr.
Godfrey
followed
the
announcement
of
his
name
 
as
Mr.
Godfrey
does
everything
else
 
exactly
at
the
right
time
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
so
close
on
the
servant
's
heels
as
to
startle
us
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
so
far
behind
as
to
cause
us
the
double
inconvenience
of
a
pause
and
an
open
door
.
<EOS>
It
is
in
the
completeness
of
his
daily
life
that
the
true
Christian
appears
.
<EOS>
This
dear
man
was
very
complete
.
  
<EOS>
"
Go
to
Miss
Verinder
,
"
said
my
aunt
,
addressing
the
servant
,
"
and
tell
her
Mr.
Ablewhite
is
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
We
both
inquired
after
his
health
.
<EOS>
We
both
asked
him
together
whether
he
felt
like
himself
again
,
after
his
terrible
adventure
of
the
past
week
.
<EOS>
With
perfect
tact
,
he
contrived
to
answer
us
at
the
same
moment
.
<EOS>
Lady
Verinder
had
his
reply
in
words
.
<EOS>
I
had
his
charming
smile
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
,
"
he
cried
,
with
infinite
tenderness
,
"
have
I
done
to
deserve
all
this
sympathy
?
<EOS>
My
dear
aunt
!
<EOS>
my
dear
Miss
Clack
!
<EOS>
I
have
merely
been
mistaken
for
somebody
else
.
<EOS>
I
have
only
been
blindfolded
;
I
have
only
been
strangled
;
I
have
only
been
thrown
flat
on
my
back
,
on
a
very
thin
carpet
,
covering
a
particularly
hard
floor
.
<EOS>
Just
think
how
much
worse
it
might
have
been
!
<EOS>
I
might
have
been
murdered
;
I
might
have
been
robbed
.
<EOS>
What
have
I
lost
?
<EOS>
Nothing
but
Nervous
Force
 
which
the
law
does
n't
recognise
as
property
;
so
that
,
strictly
speaking
,
I
have
lost
nothing
at
all
.
<EOS>
If
I
could
have
had
my
own
way
,
I
would
have
kept
my
adventure
to
myself
 
<EOS>
I
shrink
from
all
this
fuss
and
publicity
.
<EOS>
But
Mr.
Luker
made
HIS
injuries
public
,
and
my
injuries
,
as
the
necessary
consequence
,
have
been
proclaimed
in
their
turn
.
<EOS>
I
have
become
the
property
of
the
newspapers
,
until
the
gentle
reader
gets
sick
of
the
subject
.
<EOS>
I
am
very
sick
indeed
of
it
myself
.
<EOS>
May
the
gentle
reader
soon
be
like
me
!
<EOS>
And
how
is
dear
Rachel
?
<EOS>
Still
enjoying
the
gaieties
of
London
?
<EOS>
So
glad
to
hear
it
!
<EOS>
Miss
Clack
,
I
need
all
your
indulgence
.
<EOS>
I
am
sadly
behind
-
hand
with
my
Committee
Work
and
my
dear
Ladies
.
<EOS>
But
I
really
do
hope
to
look
in
at
the
Mothers'-Small
-
Clothes
next
week
.
<EOS>
Did
you
make
cheering
progress
at
Monday
's
Committee
?
<EOS>
Was
the
Board
hopeful
about
future
prospects
?
<EOS>
And
are
we
nicely
off
for
Trousers
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
heavenly
gentleness
of
his
smile
made
his
apologies
irresistible
.
<EOS>
The
richness
of
his
deep
voice
added
its
own
indescribable
charm
to
the
interesting
business
question
which
he
had
just
addressed
to
me
.
<EOS>
In
truth
,
we
were
almost
TOO
nicely
off
for
Trousers
;
we
were
quite
overwhelmed
by
them
.
<EOS>
I
was
just
about
to
say
so
,
when
the
door
opened
again
,
and
an
element
of
worldly
disturbance
entered
the
room
,
in
the
person
of
Miss
Verinder
.
  
<EOS>
She
approached
dear
Mr.
Godfrey
at
a
most
unladylike
rate
of
speed
,
with
her
hair
shockingly
untidy
,
and
her
face
,
what
I
should
call
,
unbecomingly
flushed
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
charmed
to
see
you
,
Godfrey
,
"
she
said
,
addressing
him
,
I
grieve
to
add
,
in
the
off
-
hand
manner
of
one
young
man
talking
to
another
.
<EOS>
"
I
wish
you
had
brought
Mr.
Luker
with
you
.
<EOS>
You
and
he
(
as
long
as
our
present
excitement
lasts
)
are
the
two
most
interesting
men
in
all
London
.
<EOS>
It
's
morbid
to
say
this
;
it
's
unhealthy
;
it
's
all
that
a
well
-
regulated
mind
like
Miss
Clack
's
most
instinctively
shudders
at
.
<EOS>
Never
mind
that
.
<EOS>
Tell
me
the
whole
of
the
Northumberland
Street
story
directly
.
<EOS>
I
know
the
newspapers
have
left
some
of
it
out
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Even
dear
Mr.
Godfrey
partakes
of
the
fallen
nature
which
we
all
inherit
from
Adam
 
<EOS>
it
is
a
very
small
share
of
our
human
legacy
,
but
,
alas
!
<EOS>
he
has
it
.
<EOS>
I
confess
it
grieved
me
to
see
him
take
Rachel
's
hand
in
both
of
his
own
hands
,
and
lay
it
softly
on
the
left
side
of
his
waistcoat
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
direct
encouragement
to
her
reckless
way
of
talking
,
and
her
insolent
reference
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dearest
Rachel
,
"
he
said
,
in
the
same
voice
which
had
thrilled
me
when
he
spoke
of
our
prospects
and
our
trousers
,
"
the
newspapers
have
told
you
everything
 
<EOS>
and
they
have
told
it
much
better
than
I
can
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Godfrey
thinks
we
all
make
too
much
of
the
matter
,
"
my
aunt
remarked
.
"
<EOS>
He
has
just
been
saying
that
he
does
n't
care
to
speak
of
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
put
the
question
with
a
sudden
flash
in
her
eyes
,
and
a
sudden
look
up
into
Mr.
Godfrey
's
face
.
<EOS>
On
his
side
,
he
looked
down
at
her
with
an
indulgence
so
injudicious
and
so
ill
-
deserved
,
that
I
really
felt
called
on
to
interfere
.
  
<EOS>
"
Rachel
,
darling
!
<EOS>
"
I
remonstrated
gently
,
"
true
greatness
and
true
courage
are
ever
modest
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
a
very
good
fellow
in
your
way
,
Godfrey
,
"
she
said
 
not
taking
the
smallest
notice
,
observe
,
of
me
,
and
still
speaking
to
her
cousin
as
if
she
was
one
young
man
addressing
another
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
am
quite
sure
you
are
not
great
;
I
do
n't
believe
you
possess
any
extraordinary
courage
;
and
I
am
firmly
persuaded
 
if
you
ever
had
any
modesty
 
that
your
lady
-
worshippers
relieved
you
of
that
virtue
a
good
many
years
since
.
<EOS>
You
have
some
private
reason
for
not
talking
of
your
adventure
in
Northumberland
Street
;
and
I
mean
to
know
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
reason
is
the
simplest
imaginable
,
and
the
most
easily
acknowledged
,
"
he
answered
,
still
bearing
with
her
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
tired
of
the
subject
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
tired
of
the
subject
?
<EOS>
My
dear
Godfrey
,
I
am
going
to
make
a
remark
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
live
a
great
deal
too
much
in
the
society
of
women
.
<EOS>
And
you
have
contracted
two
very
bad
habits
in
consequence
.
<EOS>
You
have
learnt
to
talk
nonsense
seriously
,
and
you
have
got
into
a
way
of
telling
fibs
for
the
pleasure
of
telling
them
.
<EOS>
You
ca
n't
go
straight
with
your
lady
-
worshippers
.
<EOS>
I
mean
to
make
you
go
straight
with
me
.
<EOS>
Come
,
and
sit
down
.
<EOS>
I
am
brimful
of
downright
questions
;
and
I
expect
you
to
be
brimful
of
downright
answers
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
actually
dragged
him
across
the
room
to
a
chair
by
the
window
,
where
the
light
would
fall
on
his
face
.
<EOS>
I
deeply
feel
being
obliged
to
report
such
language
,
and
to
describe
such
conduct
.
<EOS>
But
,
hemmed
in
,
as
I
am
,
between
Mr.
Franklin
Blake
's
cheque
on
one
side
and
my
own
sacred
regard
for
truth
on
the
other
,
what
am
I
to
do
?
<EOS>
I
looked
at
my
aunt
.
<EOS>
She
sat
unmoved
;
apparently
in
no
way
disposed
to
interfere
.
<EOS>
I
had
never
noticed
this
kind
of
torpor
in
her
before
.
<EOS>
It
was
,
perhaps
,
the
reaction
after
the
trying
time
she
had
had
in
the
country
.
<EOS>
Not
a
pleasant
symptom
to
remark
,
be
it
<EOS>
what
it
might
,
at
dear
Lady
Verinder
's
age
,
and
with
dear
Lady
Verinder
's
autumnal
exuberance
of
figure
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
,
Rachel
had
settled
herself
at
the
window
with
our
amiable
and
forbearing
 
our
too
forbearing
 
Mr.
Godfrey
.
<EOS>
She
began
the
string
of
questions
with
which
she
had
threatened
him
,
taking
no
more
notice
of
her
mother
,
or
of
myself
,
than
if
we
had
not
been
in
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
Have
the
police
done
anything
,
Godfrey
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nothing
whatever
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
certain
,
I
suppose
,
that
the
three
men
who
laid
the
trap
for
you
were
the
same
three
men
who
afterwards
laid
the
trap
for
Mr.
Luker
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Humanly
speaking
,
my
dear
Rachel
,
there
can
be
no
doubt
of
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
not
a
trace
of
them
has
been
discovered
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Not
a
trace
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
thought
 
is
it
not
?
 
<EOS>
that
these
three
men
are
the
three
Indians
who
came
to
our
house
in
the
country
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Some
people
think
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
think
so
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Rachel
,
they
blindfolded
me
before
I
could
see
their
faces
.
<EOS>
I
know
nothing
whatever
of
the
matter
.
<EOS>
How
can
I
offer
an
opinion
on
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
Even
the
angelic
gentleness
of
Mr.
Godfrey
was
,
you
see
,
beginning
to
give
way
at
last
under
the
persecution
inflicted
on
him
.
<EOS>
Whether
unbridled
curiosity
,
or
ungovernable
dread
,
dictated
Miss
Verinder
's
questions
I
do
not
presume
to
inquire
.
<EOS>
I
only
report
that
,
on
Mr.
Godfrey
's
attempting
to
rise
,
after
giving
her
the
answer
just
described
,
she
actually
took
him
by
the
two
shoulders
,
and
pushed
him
back
into
his
chair
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
do
n't
say
this
was
immodest
!
<EOS>
do
n't
even
hint
that
the
recklessness
of
guilty
terror
could
alone
account
for
such
conduct
as
I
have
described
!
<EOS>
We
must
not
judge
others
.
<EOS>
My
Christian
friends
,
indeed
,
indeed
,
indeed
,
we
must
not
judge
others
!
  
<EOS>
She
went
on
with
her
questions
,
unabashed
.
<EOS>
Earnest
Biblical
students
will
perhaps
be
reminded
 
as
I
was
reminded
 
of
the
blinded
children
of
the
devil
,
who
went
on
with
their
orgies
,
unabashed
,
in
the
time
before
the
Flood
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
know
something
about
Mr.
Luker
,
Godfrey
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
again
unfortunate
,
Rachel
.
<EOS>
No
man
knows
less
of
Mr.
Luker
than
I
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
never
saw
him
before
you
and
he
met
accidentally
at
the
bank
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Never
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
seen
him
since
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
We
have
been
examined
together
,
as
well
as
separately
,
to
assist
the
police
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Luker
was
robbed
of
a
receipt
which
he
had
got
from
his
banker
's
 
<EOS>
was
he
not
?
<EOS>
What
was
the
receipt
for
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
For
a
valuable
gem
which
he
had
placed
in
the
safe
keeping
of
the
bank
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
what
the
newspapers
say
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
enough
for
the
general
reader
;
but
it
is
not
enough
for
me
.
<EOS>
The
banker
's
receipt
must
have
mentioned
what
the
gem
was
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
banker
's
receipt
,
Rachel
 
as
I
have
heard
it
described
 
mentioned
nothing
of
the
kind
.
<EOS>
A
valuable
gem
,
belonging
to
Mr.
Luker
;
deposited
by
Mr.
Luker
;
sealed
with
Mr.
Luker
's
seal
;
and
only
to
be
given
up
on
Mr.
Luker
's
personal
application
.
<EOS>
That
was
the
form
,
and
that
is
all
I
know
about
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
waited
a
moment
,
after
he
had
said
that
.
<EOS>
She
looked
at
her
mother
,
and
sighed
.
<EOS>
She
looked
back
again
at
Mr.
Godfrey
,
and
went
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
Some
of
our
private
affairs
,
at
home
,
"
she
said
,
"
seem
to
have
got
into
the
newspapers
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
grieve
to
say
,
it
is
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
some
idle
people
,
perfect
strangers
to
us
,
are
trying
to
trace
a
connexion
between
what
happened
at
our
house
in
Yorkshire
and
what
has
happened
since
,
here
in
London
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
The
public
curiosity
,
in
certain
quarters
,
is
,
I
fear
,
taking
that
turn
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
people
who
say
that
the
three
unknown
men
who
ill
-
used
you
and
Mr.
Luker
are
the
three
Indians
,
also
say
that
the
valuable
gem
 
"
  
There
she
stopped
.
<EOS>
She
had
become
gradually
,
within
the
last
few
moments
,
whiter
and
whiter
in
the
face
.
<EOS>
The
extraordinary
blackness
of
her
hair
made
this
paleness
,
by
contrast
,
so
ghastly
to
look
at
,
that
we
all
thought
she
would
faint
,
at
the
moment
when
she
checked
herself
in
the
middle
of
her
question
.
<EOS>
Dear
Mr.
Godfrey
made
a
second
attempt
to
leave
his
chair
.
<EOS>
My
aunt
entreated
her
to
say
no
more
.
<EOS>
I
followed
my
aunt
with
a
modest
medicinal
peace
-
offering
,
in
the
shape
of
a
bottle
of
salts
.
<EOS>
We
none
of
us
produced
the
slightest
effect
on
her
.
"
<EOS>
Godfrey
,
stay
where
you
are
.
<EOS>
Mamma
,
there
is
not
the
least
reason
to
be
alarmed
about
me
.
<EOS>
Clack
,
you
're
dying
to
hear
the
end
of
it
 
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
faint
,
expressly
to
oblige
YOU
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Those
were
the
exact
words
she
used
 
taken
down
in
my
diary
the
moment
I
got
home
.
<EOS>
But
,
oh
,
do
n't
let
us
judge
!
<EOS>
My
Christian
friends
,
do
n't
let
us
judge
!
  
<EOS>
She
turned
once
more
to
Mr.
Godfrey
.
<EOS>
With
an
obstinacy
dreadful
to
see
,
she
went
back
again
to
the
place
where
she
had
checked
herself
,
and
completed
her
question
in
these
words
:
  
<EOS>
"
I
spoke
to
you
,
a
minute
since
,
about
what
people
were
saying
in
certain
quarters
.
<EOS>
Tell
me
plainly
,
Godfrey
,
do
they
any
of
them
say
that
Mr.
Luker
's
valuable
gem
is
 
the
Moonstone
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
As
the
name
of
the
Indian
Diamond
passed
her
lips
,
I
saw
a
change
come
over
my
admirable
friend
.
<EOS>
His
complexion
deepened
.
<EOS>
He
lost
the
genial
suavity
of
manner
which
is
one
of
his
greatest
charms
.
<EOS>
A
noble
indignation
inspired
his
reply
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
DO
say
it
,
"
he
answered
.
<EOS>
"
There
are
people
who
do
n't
hesitate
to
accuse
Mr.
Luker
of
telling
a
falsehood
to
serve
some
private
interests
of
his
own
.
<EOS>
He
has
over
and
over
again
solemnly
declared
that
,
until
this
scandal
assailed
him
,
he
had
never
even
heard
of
the
Moonstone
.
<EOS>
And
these
vile
people
reply
,
without
a
shadow
of
proof
to
justify
them
,
He
has
his
reasons
for
concealment
;
we
decline
to
believe
him
on
his
oath
.
<EOS>
Shameful
!
<EOS>
shameful
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Rachel
looked
at
him
very
strangely
 
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
well
describe
how
 
while
he
was
speaking
.
<EOS>
When
he
had
done
,
she
said
,
"
Considering
that
Mr.
Luker
is
only
a
chance
acquaintance
of
yours
,
you
take
up
his
cause
,
Godfrey
,
rather
warmly
.
"
  
<EOS>
My
gifted
friend
made
her
one
of
the
most
truly
evangelical
answers
I
ever
heard
in
my
life
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
,
Rachel
,
I
take
up
the
cause
of
all
oppressed
people
rather
warmly
,
"
he
said
.
  
<EOS>
The
tone
in
which
those
words
were
spoken
might
have
melted
a
stone
.
<EOS>
But
,
oh
dear
,
what
is
the
hardness
of
stone
?
<EOS>
Nothing
,
compared
to
the
hardness
of
the
unregenerate
human
heart
!
<EOS>
She
sneered
.
<EOS>
I
blush
to
record
it
 
<EOS>
she
sneered
at
him
to
his
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
Keep
your
noble
sentiments
for
your
Ladies
'
Committees
,
Godfrey
.
<EOS>
I
am
certain
that
the
scandal
which
has
assailed
Mr.
Luker
,
has
not
spared
You
.
"
  
<EOS>
Even
my
aunt
's
torpor
was
roused
by
those
words
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Rachel
,
"
she
remonstrated
,
"
you
have
really
no
right
to
say
that
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
mean
no
harm
,
mamma
 
<EOS>
I
mean
good
.
<EOS>
Have
a
moment
's
patience
with
me
,
and
you
will
see
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
looked
back
at
Mr.
Godfrey
,
with
what
appeared
to
be
a
sudden
pity
for
him
.
<EOS>
She
went
the
length
 
<EOS>
the
very
unladylike
length
 
of
taking
him
by
the
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
certain
,
"
she
said
,
"
that
I
have
found
out
the
true
reason
of
your
unwillingness
to
speak
of
this
matter
before
my
mother
and
before
me
.
<EOS>
An
unlucky
accident
has
associated
you
in
people
's
minds
with
Mr.
Luker
.
<EOS>
You
have
told
me
what
scandal
says
of
HIM
.
<EOS>
What
does
scandal
say
of
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
Even
at
the
eleventh
hour
,
<EOS>
dear
Mr.
Godfrey
 
<EOS>
always
ready
to
return
good
for
evil
 
<EOS>
tried
to
spare
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
ask
me
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
better
forgotten
,
Rachel
 
<EOS>
it
is
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
WILL
hear
it
!
"
<EOS>
she
cried
out
,
fiercely
,
at
the
top
of
her
voice
.
  
<EOS>
"
Tell
her
,
Godfrey
!
"
entreated
my
aunt
.
<EOS>
"
Nothing
can
do
her
such
harm
as
your
silence
is
doing
now
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Godfrey
's
fine
eyes
filled
with
tears
.
<EOS>
He
cast
one
last
appealing
look
at
her
 
<EOS>
and
then
he
spoke
the
fatal
words
:
  
"
<EOS>
If
you
will
have
it
,
Rachel
 
scandal
says
that
the
Moonstone
is
in
pledge
to
Mr.
Luker
,
and
that
I
am
the
man
who
has
pawned
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
started
to
her
feet
with
a
scream
.
<EOS>
She
looked
backwards
and
forwards
from
Mr.
Godfrey
to
my
aunt
,
and
from
my
aunt
to
Mr.
Godfrey
,
in
such
a
frantic
manner
that
I
really
thought
she
had
gone
mad
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
speak
to
me
!
<EOS>
Do
n't
touch
me
!
"
<EOS>
she
exclaimed
,
shrinking
back
from
all
of
us
<EOS>
(
I
declare
like
some
hunted
animal
!
)
<EOS>
into
a
corner
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
"
This
is
my
fault
!
<EOS>
I
must
set
it
right
.
<EOS>
I
have
sacrificed
myself
 
<EOS>
I
had
a
right
to
do
that
,
if
I
liked
.
<EOS>
But
to
let
an
innocent
man
be
ruined
;
to
keep
a
secret
which
destroys
his
character
for
life
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
good
God
,
it
's
too
horrible
!
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
bear
it
!
"
  
<EOS>
My
aunt
half
rose
from
her
chair
,
then
suddenly
sat
down
again
.
<EOS>
She
called
to
me
faintly
,
and
pointed
to
a
little
phial
in
her
work
-
box
.
  
<EOS>
"
Quick
!
"
<EOS>
she
whispered
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Six
drops
,
in
water
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
let
Rachel
see
.
"
  
<EOS>
Under
other
circumstances
,
I
should
have
thought
this
strange
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
time
now
to
think
 
there
was
only
time
to
give
the
medicine
.
<EOS>
Dear
Mr.
Godfrey
unconsciously
assisted
me
in
concealing
what
I
was
about
from
Rachel
,
by
speaking
composing
words
to
her
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
,
indeed
,
you
exaggerate
,
"
I
heard
him
say
.
<EOS>
"
My
reputation
stands
too
high
to
be
destroyed
by
a
miserable
passing
scandal
like
this
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
all
forgotten
in
another
week
.
<EOS>
Let
us
never
speak
of
it
again
.
<EOS>
"
She
was
perfectly
inaccessible
,
even
to
such
generosity
as
this
.
<EOS>
She
went
on
from
bad
to
worse
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
,
and
will
,
stop
it
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
Mamma
!
hear
what
I
say
.
<EOS>
Miss
Clack
!
<EOS>
hear
what
I
say
.
<EOS>
I
know
the
hand
that
took
the
Moonstone
.
<EOS>
I
know
 
<EOS>
"
she
laid
a
strong
emphasis
on
the
words
;
she
stamped
her
foot
in
the
rage
that
possessed
her
 
<EOS>
"
I
KNOW
THAT
<EOS>
GODFREY
ABLEWHITE
IS
INNOCENT
.
<EOS>
Take
me
to
the
magistrate
,
Godfrey
!
<EOS>
Take
me
to
the
magistrate
,
and
I
will
swear
it
!
"
  
<EOS>
My
aunt
caught
me
by
the
hand
,
and
whispered
,
"
<EOS>
Stand
between
us
for
a
minute
or
two
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
let
Rachel
see
me
.
<EOS>
"
I
noticed
a
bluish
tinge
in
her
face
which
alarmed
me
.
<EOS>
She
saw
I
was
startled
.
<EOS>
"
The
drops
will
put
me
right
in
a
minute
or
two
,
"
she
said
,
and
so
closed
her
eyes
,
and
waited
a
little
.
  
<EOS>
While
this
was
going
on
,
I
heard
dear
Mr.
Godfrey
still
gently
remonstrating
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
not
appear
publicly
in
such
a
thing
as
this
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
YOUR
reputation
,
dearest
Rachel
,
is
something
too
pure
and
too
sacred
to
be
trifled
with
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
MY
reputation
!
"
<EOS>
She
burst
out
laughing
.
<EOS>
"
Why
,
I
am
accused
,
Godfrey
,
as
well
as
you
.
<EOS>
The
best
detective
officer
in
England
declares
that
I
have
stolen
my
own
Diamond
.
<EOS>
Ask
him
what
he
thinks
 
and
he
will
tell
you
that
I
have
pledged
the
Moonstone
to
pay
my
private
debts
!
"
<EOS>
She
stopped
,
ran
across
the
room
 
and
fell
on
her
knees
at
her
mother
's
feet
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
mamma
!
<EOS>
mamma
!
<EOS>
mamma
!
<EOS>
I
must
be
mad
 
<EOS>
must
n't
I
?
 
<EOS>
not
to
own
the
truth
NOW
?
<EOS>
"
She
was
too
vehement
to
notice
her
mother
's
condition
 
<EOS>
she
was
on
her
feet
again
,
and
back
with
Mr.
Godfrey
,
in
an
instant
.
<EOS>
"
I
wo
n't
let
you
 
I
wo
n't
let
any
innocent
man
 
be
accused
and
disgraced
through
my
fault
.
<EOS>
If
you
wo
n't
take
me
before
the
magistrate
,
draw
out
a
declaration
of
your
innocence
on
paper
,
and
I
will
sign
it
.
<EOS>
Do
as
I
tell
you
,
Godfrey
,
or
I
'll
write
it
to
the
newspapers
I
'll
go
out
,
and
cry
it
in
the
streets
!
"
  
<EOS>
We
will
not
say
this
was
the
language
of
remorse
 
<EOS>
we
will
say
it
was
the
language
of
hysterics
.
<EOS>
Indulgent
Mr.
Godfrey
pacified
her
by
taking
a
sheet
of
paper
,
and
drawing
out
the
declaration
.
<EOS>
She
signed
it
in
a
feverish
hurry
.
"
<EOS>
Show
it
everywhere
 
do
n't
think
of
ME
,
"
she
said
,
as
she
gave
it
to
him
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
afraid
,
Godfrey
,
I
have
not
done
you
justice
,
hitherto
,
in
my
thoughts
.
<EOS>
You
are
more
unselfish
 
<EOS>
you
are
a
better
man
than
I
believed
you
to
be
.
<EOS>
Come
here
when
you
can
,
and
I
will
try
and
repair
the
wrong
I
have
done
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
gave
him
her
hand
.
<EOS>
Alas
,
for
our
fallen
nature
!
<EOS>
Alas
,
for
Mr.
Godfrey
!
<EOS>
He
not
only
forgot
himself
so
far
as
to
kiss
her
hand
 
<EOS>
he
adopted
a
gentleness
of
tone
in
answering
her
which
,
in
such
a
case
,
was
little
better
than
a
compromise
with
sin
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
come
,
dearest
,
"
he
said
,
"
on
condition
that
we
do
n't
speak
of
this
hateful
subject
again
.
<EOS>
"
Never
had
I
seen
and
heard
our
Christian
Hero
to
less
advantage
than
on
this
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
Before
another
word
could
be
said
by
anybody
,
a
thundering
knock
at
the
street
door
startled
us
all
.
<EOS>
I
looked
through
the
window
,
and
saw
the
World
,
the
Flesh
,
and
the
Devil
waiting
before
the
house
 
as
typified
in
a
carriage
and
horses
,
a
powdered
footman
,
and
three
of
the
most
audaciously
dressed
women
I
ever
beheld
in
my
life
.
  
<EOS>
Rachel
started
,
and
composed
herself
.
<EOS>
She
crossed
the
room
to
her
mother
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
have
come
to
take
me
to
the
flower
-
show
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
One
word
,
mamma
,
before
I
go
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
distressed
you
,
have
I
?
"
  
<EOS>
(
Is
the
bluntness
of
moral
feeling
which
could
ask
such
a
question
as
that
,
after
what
had
just
happened
,
to
be
pitied
or
condemned
?
<EOS>
I
like
to
lean
towards
mercy
.
<EOS>
Let
us
pity
it
.
)
  
<EOS>
The
drops
had
produced
their
effect
.
<EOS>
My
poor
aunt
's
complexion
was
like
itself
again
.
"
<EOS>
No
,
no
,
my
dear
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
Go
with
our
friends
,
and
enjoy
yourself
.
"
  
<EOS>
Her
daughter
stooped
,
and
kissed
her
.
<EOS>
I
had
left
the
window
,
and
was
near
the
door
,
when
Rachel
approached
it
to
go
out
.
<EOS>
Another
change
had
come
over
her
 
<EOS>
she
was
in
tears
.
<EOS>
I
looked
with
interest
at
the
momentary
softening
of
that
obdurate
heart
.
<EOS>
I
felt
inclined
to
say
a
few
earnest
words
.
<EOS>
Alas
!
<EOS>
my
well
-
meant
sympathy
only
gave
offence
.
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
by
pitying
me
?
"
<EOS>
she
asked
in
a
bitter
whisper
,
as
she
passed
to
the
door
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
see
how
happy
I
am
?
<EOS>
I
'm
going
to
the
flower
-
show
,
Clack
;
and
I
've
got
the
prettiest
bonnet
in
London
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
completed
the
hollow
mockery
of
that
address
by
blowing
me
a
kiss
 
and
so
left
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
I
wish
I
could
describe
in
words
the
compassion
I
felt
for
this
miserable
and
misguided
girl
.
<EOS>
But
I
am
almost
as
poorly
provided
with
words
as
with
money
.
<EOS>
Permit
me
to
say
 
my
heart
bled
for
her
.
  
<EOS>
Returning
to
my
aunt
's
chair
,
I
observed
dear
Mr.
Godfrey
searching
for
something
softly
,
here
and
there
,
in
different
parts
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
Before
I
could
offer
to
assist
him
he
had
found
what
he
wanted
.
<EOS>
He
came
back
to
my
aunt
and
me
,
with
his
declaration
of
innocence
in
one
hand
,
and
with
a
box
of
matches
in
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
aunt
,
a
little
conspiracy
!
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
Dear
Miss
Clack
,
a
pious
fraud
which
even
your
high
moral
rectitude
will
excuse
!
<EOS>
Will
you
leave
Rachel
to
suppose
that
I
accept
the
generous
self
-
sacrifice
which
has
signed
this
paper
?
<EOS>
And
will
you
kindly
bear
witness
that
I
destroy
it
in
your
presence
,
before
I
leave
the
house
?
"
<EOS>
He
kindled
a
match
,
and
,
lighting
the
paper
,
laid
it
to
burn
in
a
plate
on
the
table
.
"
<EOS>
Any
trifling
inconvenience
that
I
may
suffer
is
as
nothing
,
"
he
remarked
,
"
compared
with
the
importance
of
preserving
that
pure
name
from
the
contaminating
contact
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
There
!
<EOS>
We
have
reduced
it
to
a
little
harmless
heap
of
ashes
;
and
our
dear
impulsive
Rachel
will
never
know
what
we
have
done
!
<EOS>
How
do
you
feel
?
<EOS>
My
precious
friends
,
how
do
you
feel
?
<EOS>
For
my
poor
part
,
I
am
as
light
-
hearted
as
a
boy
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
beamed
on
us
with
his
beautiful
smile
;
he
held
out
a
hand
to
my
aunt
,
and
a
hand
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
was
too
deeply
affected
by
his
noble
conduct
to
speak
.
<EOS>
I
closed
my
eyes
;
I
put
his
hand
,
in
a
kind
of
spiritual
self
-
forgetfulness
,
to
my
lips
.
<EOS>
He
murmured
a
soft
remonstrance
.
<EOS>
Oh
the
ecstasy
,
the
pure
,
unearthly
ecstasy
of
that
moment
!
<EOS>
I
sat
 
<EOS>
I
hardly
know
on
what
 
quite
lost
in
my
own
exalted
feelings
.
<EOS>
When
I
opened
my
eyes
again
,
it
was
like
descending
from
heaven
to
earth
.
<EOS>
There
was
nobody
but
my
aunt
in
the
room
.
<EOS>
He
had
gone
.
  
<EOS>
I
should
like
to
stop
here
 
<EOS>
I
should
like
to
close
my
narrative
with
the
record
of
Mr.
Godfrey
's
noble
conduct
.
<EOS>
Unhappily
there
is
more
,
much
more
,
which
the
unrelenting
pecuniary
pressure
of
Mr.
Blake
's
cheque
obliges
me
to
tell
.
<EOS>
The
painful
disclosures
which
were
to
reveal
themselves
in
my
presence
,
during
that
Tuesday
's
visit
to
Montagu
Square
,
were
not
at
an
end
yet
.
  
<EOS>
Finding
myself
alone
with
Lady
Verinder
,
I
turned
naturally
to
the
subject
of
her
health
;
touching
delicately
on
the
strange
anxiety
which
she
had
shown
to
conceal
her
indisposition
,
and
the
remedy
applied
to
it
,
from
the
observation
of
her
daughter
.
  
<EOS>
My
aunt
's
reply
greatly
surprised
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
Drusilla
,
"
she
said
(
if
I
have
not
already
mentioned
that
my
Christian
name
is
Drusilla
,
permit
me
to
mention
it
now
)
,
"
you
are
touching
quite
innocently
,
I
know
 
on
a
very
distressing
subject
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
rose
immediately
.
<EOS>
Delicacy
left
me
but
one
alternative
 
the
alternative
,
after
first
making
my
apologies
,
of
taking
my
leave
.
<EOS>
Lady
Verinder
stopped
me
,
and
insisted
on
my
sitting
down
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
surprised
a
secret
,
"
she
said
,
"
which
I
had
confided
to
my
sister
Mrs.
Ablewhite
,
and
to
my
lawyer
Mr.
Bruff
,
and
to
no
one
else
.
<EOS>
I
can
trust
in
their
discretion
;
and
I
am
sure
,
when
I
tell
you
the
circumstances
,
I
can
trust
in
yours
.
<EOS>
Have
you
any
pressing
engagement
,
Drusilla
?
<EOS>
or
is
your
time
your
own
this
afternoon
?
"
  
<EOS>
It
is
needless
to
say
that
my
time
was
entirely
at
my
aunt
's
disposal
.
  
<EOS>
"
Keep
me
company
then
,
"
she
said
,
"
for
another
hour
.
<EOS>
I
have
something
to
tell
you
which
I
believe
you
will
be
sorry
to
hear
.
<EOS>
And
I
shall
have
a
service
to
ask
of
you
afterwards
,
if
you
do
n't
object
to
assist
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
is
again
needless
to
say
that
,
so
far
from
objecting
,
I
was
all
eagerness
to
assist
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
can
wait
here
,
"
she
went
on
,
"
till
Mr.
Bruff
comes
at
five
.
<EOS>
And
you
can
be
one
of
the
witnesses
,
Drusilla
,
when
I
sign
my
Will
.
"
  
<EOS>
Her
Will
!
<EOS>
I
thought
of
the
drops
which
I
had
seen
in
her
work
-
box
.
<EOS>
I
thought
of
the
bluish
tinge
which
I
had
noticed
in
her
complexion
.
<EOS>
A
light
which
was
not
of
this
world
 
a
light
shining
prophetically
from
an
unmade
grave
 
dawned
on
my
mind
.
<EOS>
My
aunt
's
secret
was
a
secret
no
longer
.
    
<EOS>
Consideration
for
poor
Lady
Verinder
forbade
me
even
to
hint
that
I
had
guessed
the
melancholy
truth
,
before
she
opened
her
lips
.
<EOS>
I
waited
her
pleasure
in
silence
;
and
,
having
privately
arranged
to
say
a
few
sustaining
words
at
the
first
convenient
opportunity
,
felt
prepared
for
any
duty
that
could
claim
me
,
no
matter
how
painful
it
might
be
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
seriously
ill
,
Drusilla
,
for
some
time
past
,
"
my
aunt
began
.
"
<EOS>
And
,
strange
to
say
,
without
knowing
it
myself
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
thought
of
the
thousands
and
thousands
of
perishing
human
creatures
who
were
all
at
that
moment
spiritually
ill
,
without
knowing
it
themselves
.
<EOS>
And
I
greatly
feared
that
my
poor
aunt
might
be
one
of
the
number
.
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
dear
,
"
I
said
,
sadly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
brought
Rachel
to
London
,
as
you
know
,
for
medical
advice
,
"
she
went
on
.
<EOS>
"
I
thought
it
right
to
consult
two
doctors
.
"
  
<EOS>
Two
doctors
!
<EOS>
And
,
oh
me
(
in
Rachel
's
state
)
,
<EOS>
not
one
clergyman
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
dear
?
<EOS>
"
I
said
once
more
.
"
<EOS>
Yes
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
One
of
the
two
medical
men
,
"
proceeded
my
aunt
,
"
was
a
stranger
to
me
.
<EOS>
The
other
had
been
an
old
friend
of
my
husband
's
,
and
had
always
felt
a
sincere
interest
in
me
for
my
husband
's
sake
.
<EOS>
After
prescribing
for
Rachel
,
he
said
he
wished
to
speak
to
me
privately
in
another
room
.
<EOS>
I
expected
,
of
course
,
to
receive
some
special
directions
for
the
management
of
my
daughter
's
health
.
<EOS>
To
my
surprise
,
he
took
me
gravely
by
the
hand
,
and
said
,
"
I
have
been
looking
at
you
,
Lady
Verinder
,
with
a
professional
as
well
as
a
personal
interest
.
<EOS>
You
are
,
I
am
afraid
,
far
more
urgently
in
need
of
medical
advice
than
your
daughter
.
"
<EOS>
He
put
some
questions
to
me
,
which
I
was
at
first
inclined
to
treat
lightly
enough
,
until
I
observed
that
my
answers
distressed
him
.
<EOS>
It
ended
in
his
making
an
appointment
to
come
and
see
me
,
accompanied
by
a
medical
friend
,
on
the
next
day
,
at
an
hour
when
Rachel
would
not
be
at
home
.
<EOS>
The
result
of
that
visit
 
most
kindly
and
gently
conveyed
to
me
 
satisfied
both
the
physicians
that
there
had
been
precious
time
lost
,
which
could
never
be
regained
,
and
that
my
case
had
now
passed
beyond
the
reach
of
their
art
.
<EOS>
For
more
than
two
years
I
have
been
suffering
under
an
insidious
form
of
heart
disease
,
which
,
without
any
symptoms
to
alarm
me
,
has
,
by
little
and
little
,
fatally
broken
me
down
.
<EOS>
I
may
live
for
some
months
,
or
I
may
die
before
another
day
has
passed
over
my
head
 
the
doctors
can
not
,
and
dare
not
,
speak
more
positively
than
this
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
vain
to
say
,
my
dear
,
that
I
have
not
had
some
miserable
moments
since
my
real
situation
has
been
made
known
to
me
.
<EOS>
But
I
am
more
resigned
than
I
was
,
and
I
am
doing
my
best
to
set
my
worldly
affairs
in
order
.
<EOS>
My
one
great
anxiety
is
that
Rachel
should
be
kept
in
ignorance
of
the
truth
.
<EOS>
If
she
knew
it
,
she
would
at
once
attribute
my
broken
health
to
anxiety
about
the
Diamond
,
and
would
reproach
herself
bitterly
,
poor
child
,
for
what
is
in
no
sense
her
fault
.
<EOS>
Both
the
doctors
agree
that
the
mischief
began
two
,
if
not
three
years
since
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
you
will
keep
my
secret
,
<EOS>
Drusilla
 
<EOS>
for
I
am
sure
I
see
sincere
sorrow
and
sympathy
for
me
in
your
face
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Sorrow
and
sympathy
!
<EOS>
Oh
,
what
Pagan
emotions
to
expect
from
a
Christian
Englishwoman
anchored
firmly
on
her
faith
!
  
<EOS>
Little
did
my
poor
aunt
imagine
what
a
gush
of
devout
thankfulness
thrilled
through
me
as
she
approached
the
close
of
her
melancholy
story
.
<EOS>
Here
was
a
career
of
usefulness
opened
before
me
!
<EOS>
Here
was
a
beloved
relative
and
perishing
fellow
-
creature
,
on
the
eve
of
the
great
change
,
utterly
unprepared
;
and
led
,
providentially
led
,
to
reveal
her
situation
to
Me
!
<EOS>
How
can
I
describe
the
joy
with
which
I
now
remembered
that
the
precious
clerical
friends
on
whom
I
could
rely
,
were
to
be
counted
,
not
by
ones
or
twos
,
but
by
tens
and
twenties
.
<EOS>
I
took
my
aunt
in
my
arms
 
<EOS>
my
overflowing
tenderness
was
not
to
be
satisfied
,
now
,
with
anything
less
than
an
embrace
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
"
I
said
to
her
,
fervently
,
"
the
indescribable
interest
with
which
you
inspire
me
!
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
the
good
<EOS>
I
mean
to
do
you
,
dear
,
before
we
part
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
After
another
word
or
two
of
earnest
prefatory
warning
,
I
gave
her
her
choice
of
three
precious
friends
,
all
plying
the
work
of
mercy
from
morning
to
night
in
her
own
neighbourhood
;
all
equally
inexhaustible
in
exhortation
;
all
affectionately
ready
to
exercise
their
gifts
at
a
word
from
me
.
<EOS>
Alas
!
<EOS>
the
result
was
far
from
encouraging
.
<EOS>
Poor
Lady
Verinder
looked
puzzled
and
frightened
,
and
met
everything
I
could
say
to
her
with
the
purely
worldly
objection
that
she
was
not
strong
enough
to
face
strangers
.
<EOS>
I
yielded
 
for
the
moment
only
,
of
course
.
<EOS>
My
large
experience
(
as
Reader
and
Visitor
,
under
not
less
,
first
and
last
,
than
fourteen
beloved
clerical
friends
)
informed
me
that
this
was
another
case
for
preparation
by
books
.
<EOS>
I
possessed
a
little
library
of
works
,
all
suitable
to
the
present
emergency
,
all
calculated
to
arouse
,
convince
,
prepare
,
enlighten
,
and
fortify
my
aunt
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
read
,
dear
,
wo
n't
you
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I
said
,
in
my
most
winning
way
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
read
,
if
I
bring
you
my
own
precious
books
?
<EOS>
Turned
down
at
all
the
right
places
,
aunt
.
<EOS>
And
marked
in
pencil
where
you
are
to
stop
and
ask
yourself
,
"
Does
this
apply
to
me
?
"
<EOS>
"
Even
that
simple
appeal
 
so
absolutely
heathenising
is
the
influence
of
the
world
 
appeared
to
startle
my
aunt
.
<EOS>
She
said
,
"
I
will
do
what
I
can
,
Drusilla
,
to
please
you
,
"
with
a
look
of
surprise
,
which
was
at
once
instructive
and
terrible
to
see
.
<EOS>
Not
a
moment
was
to
be
lost
.
<EOS>
The
clock
on
the
mantel
-
piece
informed
me
that
I
had
just
time
to
hurry
home
;
to
provide
myself
with
a
first
series
of
selected
readings
(
say
a
dozen
only
)
;
and
to
return
in
time
to
meet
the
lawyer
,
and
witness
Lady
Verinder
's
Will
.
<EOS>
Promising
faithfully
to
be
back
by
five
o'clock
,
I
left
the
house
on
my
errand
of
mercy
.
  
<EOS>
When
no
interests
but
my
own
are
involved
,
I
am
humbly
content
to
get
from
place
to
place
by
the
omnibus
.
<EOS>
Permit
me
to
give
an
idea
of
my
devotion
to
my
aunt
's
interests
by
recording
that
,
on
this
occasion
,
I
committed
the
prodigality
of
taking
a
cab
.
  
<EOS>
I
drove
home
,
selected
and
marked
my
first
series
of
readings
,
and
drove
back
to
Montagu
Square
,
with
a
dozen
works
in
a
carpet
-
bag
,
the
like
of
which
,
I
firmly
believe
,
are
not
to
be
found
in
the
literature
of
any
other
country
in
Europe
.
<EOS>
I
paid
the
cabman
exactly
his
fare
.
<EOS>
He
received
it
with
an
oath
;
upon
which
I
instantly
gave
him
a
tract
.
<EOS>
If
I
had
presented
a
pistol
at
his
head
,
this
abandoned
wretch
could
hardly
have
exhibited
greater
consternation
.
<EOS>
He
jumped
up
on
his
box
,
and
,
with
profane
exclamations
of
dismay
,
drove
off
furiously
.
<EOS>
Quite
useless
,
I
am
happy
to
say
!
<EOS>
I
sowed
the
good
seed
,
in
spite
of
him
,
by
throwing
a
second
tract
in
at
the
window
of
the
cab
.
  
<EOS>
The
servant
who
answered
the
door
 
not
the
person
with
the
cap
-
ribbons
,
to
my
great
relief
,
but
the
foot
-
man
 
informed
me
that
the
doctor
had
called
,
and
was
still
shut
up
with
Lady
Verinder
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bruff
,
the
lawyer
,
had
arrived
a
minute
since
and
was
waiting
in
the
library
.
<EOS>
I
was
shown
into
the
library
to
wait
too
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Bruff
looked
surprised
to
see
me
.
<EOS>
He
is
the
family
solicitor
,
and
we
had
met
more
than
once
,
on
previous
occasions
,
under
Lady
Verinder
's
roof
.
<EOS>
A
man
,
I
grieve
to
say
,
grown
old
and
grizzled
in
the
service
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
A
man
who
,
in
his
hours
of
business
,
was
the
chosen
prophet
of
Law
and
Mammon
;
and
who
,
in
his
hours
of
leisure
,
was
equally
capable
of
reading
a
novel
and
of
tearing
up
a
tract
.
  
<EOS>
"
Have
you
come
to
stay
here
,
Miss
Clack
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
,
with
a
look
at
my
carpet
-
bag
.
  
<EOS>
To
reveal
the
contents
of
my
precious
bag
to
such
a
person
as
this
would
have
been
simply
to
invite
an
outburst
of
profanity
.
<EOS>
I
lowered
myself
to
his
own
level
,
and
mentioned
my
business
in
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
aunt
has
informed
me
that
she
is
about
to
sign
her
Will
,
"
I
answered
.
<EOS>
"
She
has
been
so
good
as
to
ask
me
to
be
one
of
the
witnesses
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Aye
?
<EOS>
aye
?
<EOS>
Well
,
Miss
Clack
,
you
will
do
.
<EOS>
You
are
over
twenty
-
one
,
and
you
have
not
the
slightest
pecuniary
interest
in
Lady
Verinder
's
Will
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Not
the
slightest
pecuniary
interest
in
Lady
Verinder
's
Will
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
how
thankful
I
felt
when
I
heard
that
!
<EOS>
If
my
aunt
,
possessed
of
thousands
,
had
remembered
poor
Me
,
to
whom
five
pounds
is
an
object
 
if
my
name
had
appeared
in
the
Will
,
with
a
little
comforting
legacy
attached
to
it
 
<EOS>
my
enemies
might
have
doubted
the
motive
which
had
loaded
me
with
the
choicest
treasures
of
my
library
,
and
had
drawn
upon
my
failing
resources
for
the
prodigal
expenses
of
a
cab
.
<EOS>
Not
the
cruellest
scoffer
of
them
all
could
doubt
now
.
<EOS>
Much
better
as
it
was
!
<EOS>
Oh
,
surely
,
surely
,
much
better
as
it
was
!
  
<EOS>
I
was
aroused
from
these
consoling
reflections
by
the
voice
of
Mr.
Bruff
.
<EOS>
My
meditative
silence
appeared
to
weigh
upon
the
spirits
of
this
worldling
,
and
to
force
him
,
as
it
were
,
into
talking
to
me
against
his
own
will
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Miss
Clack
,
what
's
the
last
news
in
the
charitable
circles
?
<EOS>
How
is
your
friend
Mr.
Godfrey
Ablewhite
,
after
the
mauling
he
got
from
the
rogues
in
Northumberland
Street
?
<EOS>
Egad
!
<EOS>
they
're
telling
a
pretty
story
about
that
charitable
gentleman
at
my
club
!
"
  
<EOS>
I
had
passed
over
the
manner
in
which
this
person
had
remarked
that
I
was
more
than
twenty
-
one
,
and
that
I
had
no
pecuniary
interest
in
my
aunt
's
Will
.
<EOS>
But
the
tone
in
which
he
alluded
to
dear
Mr.
Godfrey
was
too
much
for
my
forbearance
.
<EOS>
Feeling
bound
,
after
what
had
passed
in
my
presence
that
afternoon
,
to
assert
the
innocence
of
my
admirable
friend
,
whenever
I
found
it
called
in
question
 
I
own
to
having
also
felt
bound
to
include
in
the
accomplishment
of
this
righteous
purpose
,
a
stinging
castigation
in
the
case
of
Mr.
Bruff
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
live
very
much
out
of
the
world
,
"
I
said
;
"
and
I
do
n't
possess
the
advantage
,
sir
,
of
belonging
to
a
club
.
<EOS>
But
I
happen
to
know
the
story
to
which
you
allude
;
and
I
also
know
that
a
viler
falsehood
than
that
story
never
was
told
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
yes
,
Miss
Clack
 
<EOS>
you
believe
in
your
friend
.
<EOS>
Natural
enough
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Godfrey
Ablewhite
,
wo
n't
find
the
world
in
general
quite
so
easy
to
convince
as
a
committee
of
charitable
ladies
.
<EOS>
Appearances
are
dead
against
him
.
<EOS>
He
was
in
the
house
when
the
Diamond
was
lost
.
<EOS>
And
he
was
the
first
person
in
the
house
to
go
to
London
afterwards
.
<EOS>
Those
are
ugly
circumstances
,
ma'am
,
viewed
by
the
light
of
later
events
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
ought
,
I
know
,
to
have
set
him
right
before
he
went
any
farther
.
<EOS>
I
ought
to
have
told
him
that
he
was
speaking
in
ignorance
of
a
testimony
to
Mr.
Godfrey
's
innocence
,
offered
by
the
only
person
who
was
undeniably
competent
to
speak
from
a
positive
knowledge
of
the
subject
.
<EOS>
Alas
!
<EOS>
the
temptation
to
lead
the
lawyer
artfully
on
to
his
own
discomfiture
was
too
much
for
me
.
<EOS>
I
asked
what
he
meant
by
"
later
events
"
 
with
an
appearance
of
the
utmost
innocence
.
  
<EOS>
"
By
later
events
,
Miss
Clack
,
I
mean
events
in
which
the
Indians
are
concerned
,
"
proceeded
Mr.
Bruff
,
getting
more
and
more
superior
to
poor
Me
,
the
longer
he
went
on
.
<EOS>
"
What
do
the
Indians
do
,
the
moment
they
are
let
out
of
the
prison
at
Frizinghall
?
<EOS>
They
go
straight
to
London
,
and
fix
on
Mr.
Luker
.
<EOS>
What
follows
?
<EOS>
Mr.
Luker
feels
alarmed
for
the
safety
of
"
a
valuable
of
great
price
,
"
which
he
has
got
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
He
lodges
it
privately
(
under
a
general
description
)
in
his
bankers
'
strong
-
room
.
<EOS>
Wonderfully
clever
of
him
:
but
the
Indians
are
just
as
clever
on
their
side
.
<EOS>
They
have
their
suspicions
that
the
"
valuable
of
great
price
"
is
being
shifted
from
one
place
to
another
;
and
they
hit
on
a
singularly
bold
and
complete
way
of
clearing
those
suspicions
up
.
<EOS>
Whom
do
they
seize
and
search
?
<EOS>
Not
Mr.
Luker
only
 
which
would
be
intelligible
enough
 
but
Mr.
Godfrey
Ablewhite
as
well
.
<EOS>
Why
?
<EOS>
Mr.
Ablewhite
's
explanation
is
,
that
they
acted
on
blind
suspicion
,
after
seeing
him
accidentally
speaking
to
Mr.
Luker
.
<EOS>
Absurd
!
<EOS>
Half
-
a
-
dozen
other
people
spoke
to
Mr.
Luker
that
morning
.
<EOS>
Why
were
they
not
followed
home
too
,
and
decoyed
into
the
trap
?
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
no
!
<EOS>
The
plain
inference
is
,
that
Mr.
Ablewhite
had
his
private
interest
in
the
"
valuable
"
as
well
as
Mr.
Luker
,
and
that
the
Indians
were
so
uncertain
as
to
which
of
the
two
had
the
disposal
of
it
,
that
there
was
no
alternative
but
to
search
them
both
.
<EOS>
Public
opinion
says
that
,
Miss
Clack
.
<EOS>
And
public
opinion
,
on
this
occasion
,
is
not
easily
refuted
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
said
those
last
words
,
looking
so
wonderfully
wise
in
his
own
worldly
conceit
,
that
I
really
(
to
my
shame
be
it
spoken
)
could
not
resist
leading
him
a
little
farther
still
,
before
I
overwhelmed
him
with
the
truth
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
presume
to
argue
with
a
clever
lawyer
like
you
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
But
is
it
quite
fair
,
sir
,
to
Mr.
Ablewhite
to
pass
over
the
opinion
of
the
famous
London
police
officer
who
investigated
this
case
?
<EOS>
Not
the
shadow
of
a
suspicion
rested
upon
anybody
but
Miss
Verinder
,
in
the
mind
of
Sergeant
Cuff
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
mean
to
tell
me
,
Miss
Clack
,
that
you
agree
with
the
Sergeant
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
judge
nobody
,
sir
,
and
I
offer
no
opinion
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
commit
both
those
enormities
,
ma'am
.
<EOS>
I
judge
the
Sergeant
to
have
been
utterly
wrong
;
and
I
offer
the
opinion
that
,
if
he
had
known
Rachel
's
character
as
I
know
it
,
he
would
have
suspected
everybody
in
the
house
but
HER
.
<EOS>
I
admit
that
she
has
her
faults
 
<EOS>
she
is
secret
,
and
self
-
willed
;
odd
and
wild
,
and
unlike
other
girls
of
her
age
.
<EOS>
But
true
as
steel
,
and
high
-
minded
and
generous
to
a
fault
.
<EOS>
If
the
plainest
evidence
in
the
world
pointed
one
way
,
and
if
nothing
but
Rachel
's
word
of
honour
pointed
the
other
,
I
would
take
her
word
before
the
evidence
,
lawyer
as
I
am
!
<EOS>
Strong
language
,
Miss
Clack
;
but
<EOS>
I
mean
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Would
you
object
to
illustrate
your
meaning
,
Mr.
Bruff
,
so
that
I
may
be
sure
I
understand
it
?
<EOS>
Suppose
you
found
Miss
Verinder
quite
unaccountably
interested
in
what
has
happened
to
Mr.
Ablewhite
and
Mr.
Luker
?
<EOS>
Suppose
she
asked
the
strangest
questions
about
this
dreadful
scandal
,
and
displayed
the
most
ungovernable
agitation
when
she
found
out
the
turn
it
was
taking
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Suppose
anything
you
please
,
Miss
Clack
,
it
would
n't
shake
my
belief
in
Rachel
Verinder
by
a
hair's
-
breadth
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
is
so
absolutely
to
be
relied
on
as
that
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
So
absolutely
to
be
relied
on
as
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
permit
me
to
inform
you
,
Mr.
Bruff
,
that
Mr.
Godfrey
Ablewhite
was
in
this
house
not
two
hours
since
,
and
that
his
entire
innocence
of
all
concern
in
the
disappearance
of
the
Moonstone
was
proclaimed
by
Miss
Verinder
herself
,
in
the
strongest
language
I
ever
heard
used
by
a
young
lady
in
my
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
enjoyed
the
triumph
 
the
unholy
triumph
<EOS>
,
I
fear
I
must
admit
 
of
seeing
Mr.
Bruff
utterly
confounded
and
overthrown
by
a
few
plain
words
from
Me
.
<EOS>
He
started
to
his
feet
,
and
stared
at
me
in
silence
.
<EOS>
I
kept
my
seat
,
undisturbed
,
and
related
the
whole
scene
as
it
had
occurred
.
"
<EOS>
And
what
do
you
say
about
Mr.
Ablewhite
now
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
,
with
the
utmost
possible
gentleness
,
as
soon
as
I
had
done
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
Rachel
has
testified
to
his
innocence
,
Miss
Clack
,
I
do
n't
scruple
to
say
that
I
believe
in
his
innocence
as
firmly
as
you
do
:
I
have
been
misled
by
appearances
,
like
the
rest
of
the
world
;
and
I
will
make
the
best
atonement
I
can
,
by
publicly
contradicting
the
scandal
which
has
assailed
your
friend
wherever
I
meet
with
it
.
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
,
allow
me
to
congratulate
you
on
the
masterly
manner
in
which
you
have
opened
the
full
fire
of
your
batteries
on
me
at
the
moment
when
I
least
expected
it
.
<EOS>
You
would
have
done
great
things
in
my
profession
,
ma'am
,
if
you
had
happened
to
be
a
man
.
"
  
<EOS>
With
those
words
he
turned
away
from
me
,
and
began
walking
irritably
up
and
down
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
I
could
see
plainly
that
the
new
light
I
had
thrown
on
the
subject
had
greatly
surprised
and
disturbed
him
.
<EOS>
Certain
expressions
dropped
from
his
lips
,
as
he
became
more
and
more
absorbed
in
his
own
thoughts
,
which
suggested
to
my
mind
the
abominable
view
that
he
had
hitherto
taken
of
the
mystery
of
the
lost
Moonstone
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
scrupled
to
suspect
dear
Mr.
Godfrey
of
the
infamy
of
stealing
the
Diamond
,
and
to
attribute
Rachel
's
conduct
to
a
generous
resolution
to
conceal
the
crime
.
<EOS>
On
Miss
Verinder
's
own
authority
 
a
perfectly
unassailable
authority
,
as
you
are
aware
,
in
the
estimation
of
Mr.
Bruff
 
that
explanation
of
the
circumstances
was
now
shown
to
be
utterly
wrong
.
<EOS>
The
perplexity
into
which
I
had
plunged
this
high
legal
authority
was
so
overwhelming
that
he
was
quite
unable
to
conceal
it
from
notice
.
<EOS>
"
What
a
case
!
<EOS>
"
I
heard
him
say
to
himself
,
stopping
at
the
window
in
his
walk
,
and
drumming
on
the
glass
with
his
fingers
.
<EOS>
"
It
not
only
defies
explanation
,
it
's
even
beyond
conjecture
.
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
nothing
in
these
words
which
made
any
reply
at
all
needful
,
on
my
part
 
and
yet
,
I
answered
them
!
<EOS>
It
seems
hardly
credible
that
I
should
not
have
been
able
to
let
Mr.
Bruff
alone
,
even
now
.
<EOS>
It
seems
almost
beyond
mere
mortal
perversity
that
I
should
have
discovered
,
in
what
he
had
just
said
,
a
new
opportunity
of
making
myself
personally
disagreeable
to
him
.
<EOS>
But
 
ah
,
my
friends
!
<EOS>
nothing
is
beyond
mortal
perversity
;
and
anything
is
credible
when
our
fallen
natures
get
the
better
of
us
!
  
<EOS>
"
Pardon
me
for
intruding
on
your
reflections
<EOS>
,
"
I
said
to
the
unsuspecting
Mr.
Bruff
.
"
<EOS>
But
surely
there
is
a
conjecture
to
make
which
has
not
occurred
to
us
yet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Maybe
,
Miss
Clack
.
<EOS>
I
own
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
what
it
is
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Before
I
was
so
fortunate
,
sir
,
as
to
convince
you
of
Mr.
Ablewhite
's
innocence
,
you
mentioned
it
as
one
of
the
reasons
for
suspecting
him
,
that
he
was
in
the
house
at
the
time
when
the
Diamond
was
lost
.
<EOS>
Permit
me
to
remind
you
that
Mr.
Franklin
Blake
was
also
in
the
house
at
the
time
when
the
Diamond
was
lost
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
old
worldling
left
the
window
,
took
a
chair
exactly
opposite
to
mine
,
and
looked
at
me
steadily
,
with
a
hard
and
vicious
smile
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
not
so
good
<EOS>
a
lawyer
,
Miss
Clack
<EOS>
,
"
he
remarked
in
a
meditative
manner
,
"
as
I
supposed
.
<EOS>
You
do
n't
know
how
to
let
well
alone
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
afraid
I
fail
to
follow
you
,
Mr.
Bruff
,
"
I
said
,
modestly
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
wo
n't
do
,
<EOS>
Miss
Clack
 
<EOS>
it
really
wo
n't
do
a
second
time
.
<EOS>
Franklin
Blake
is
a
prime
favourite
of
mine
,
as
you
are
well
aware
.
<EOS>
But
that
does
n't
matter
.
<EOS>
I
'll
adopt
your
view
,
on
this
occasion
,
before
you
have
time
to
turn
round
on
me
.
<EOS>
You
're
quite
right
,
ma'am
.
<EOS>
I
have
suspected
Mr.
Ablewhite
,
on
grounds
which
abstractedly
justify
suspecting
Mr.
Blake
too
.
<EOS>
Very
good
 
<EOS>
let
's
suspect
them
together
.
<EOS>
It
's
quite
in
his
character
,
we
will
say
,
to
be
capable
of
stealing
the
Moonstone
.
<EOS>
The
only
question
is
,
whether
it
was
his
interest
to
do
so
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Franklin
Blake
's
debts
,
"
I
remarked
,
"
are
matters
of
family
notoriety
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
Mr.
Godfrey
Ablewhite
's
debts
have
not
arrived
at
that
stage
of
development
yet
.
<EOS>
Quite
true
.
<EOS>
But
there
happen
to
be
two
difficulties
in
the
way
of
your
theory
,
Miss
Clack
.
<EOS>
I
manage
Franklin
Blake
's
affairs
,
and
I
beg
to
inform
you
that
the
vast
majority
of
his
creditors
(
knowing
his
father
to
be
a
rich
man
)
are
quite
content
to
charge
interest
on
their
debts
,
and
to
wait
for
their
money
.
<EOS>
There
is
the
first
difficulty
 
which
is
tough
enough
.
<EOS>
You
will
find
the
second
tougher
still
.
<EOS>
I
have
it
on
the
authority
of
Lady
Verinder
herself
,
that
her
daughter
was
ready
to
marry
Franklin
Blake
,
before
that
infernal
Indian
Diamond
disappeared
from
the
house
.
<EOS>
She
had
drawn
him
on
and
put
him
off
again
,
with
the
coquetry
of
a
young
girl
.
<EOS>
But
she
had
confessed
to
her
mother
that
she
loved
cousin
Franklin
,
and
her
mother
had
trusted
cousin
Franklin
with
the
secret
.
<EOS>
So
there
he
was
,
Miss
Clack
,
with
his
creditors
content
to
wait
,
and
with
the
certain
prospect
before
him
of
marrying
an
heiress
.
<EOS>
By
all
means
consider
him
a
scoundrel
;
but
tell
me
,
if
you
please
,
why
he
should
steal
the
Moonstone
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
human
heart
is
unsearchable
,
"
I
said
gently
.
<EOS>
"
Who
is
to
fathom
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
In
other
words
,
ma'am
 
though
he
had
n't
the
shadow
of
a
reason
for
taking
the
Diamond
 
he
might
have
taken
it
,
nevertheless
,
through
natural
depravity
.
<EOS>
Very
well
.
<EOS>
Say
he
did
.
<EOS>
Why
the
devil
 
"
  
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
Mr.
Bruff
.
<EOS>
If
I
hear
the
devil
referred
to
in
that
manner
,
I
must
leave
the
room
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
beg
YOUR
pardon
,
Miss
Clack
 
<EOS>
I
'll
be
more
careful
in
my
choice
of
language
for
the
future
.
<EOS>
All
I
meant
to
ask
was
this
.
<EOS>
Why
 
even
supposing
he
did
take
the
Diamond
 
<EOS>
should
Franklin
Blake
make
himself
the
most
prominent
person
in
the
house
in
trying
to
recover
it
?
<EOS>
You
may
tell
me
he
cunningly
did
that
to
divert
suspicion
from
himself
.
<EOS>
I
answer
that
he
had
no
need
to
divert
suspicion
 
because
nobody
suspected
him
.
<EOS>
He
first
steals
the
Moonstone
(
without
the
slightest
reason
)
through
natural
depravity
;
and
he
then
acts
a
part
,
in
relation
to
the
loss
of
the
jewel
,
which
there
is
not
the
slightest
necessity
to
act
,
and
which
leads
to
his
mortally
offending
the
young
lady
who
would
otherwise
have
married
him
.
<EOS>
That
is
the
monstrous
proposition
which
you
are
driven
to
assert
,
if
you
attempt
to
associate
the
disappearance
of
the
Moonstone
with
Franklin
Blake
.
<EOS>
No
,
no
,
Miss
Clack
!
<EOS>
After
what
has
passed
here
to
-
day
,
between
us
two
,
the
dead
-
lock
,
in
this
case
,
is
complete
.
<EOS>
Rachel
's
own
innocence
is
(
as
her
mother
knows
,
and
as
I
know
)
beyond
a
doubt
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Ablewhite
's
innocence
is
equally
certain
 
or
Rachel
would
never
have
testified
to
it
.
<EOS>
And
Franklin
Blake
's
innocence
,
as
you
have
just
seen
,
unanswerably
asserts
itself
.
<EOS>
On
the
one
hand
,
we
are
morally
certain
of
all
these
things
.
<EOS>
And
,
on
the
other
hand
,
we
are
equally
sure
that
somebody
has
brought
the
Moonstone
to
London
,
and
that
Mr.
Luker
,
or
his
banker
,
is
in
private
possession
of
it
at
this
moment
.
<EOS>
What
is
the
use
of
my
experience
,
what
is
the
use
of
any
person
's
experience
,
in
such
a
case
as
that
?
<EOS>
It
baffles
me
;
it
baffles
you
,
it
baffles
everybody
.
"
  
<EOS>
No
 
not
everybody
.
<EOS>
It
had
not
baffled
Sergeant
Cuff
.
<EOS>
I
was
about
to
mention
this
,
with
all
possible
mildness
,
and
with
every
necessary
protest
against
being
supposed
to
cast
a
slur
upon
Rachel
 
when
the
servant
came
in
to
say
that
the
doctor
had
gone
,
and
that
my
aunt
was
waiting
to
receive
us
.
  
<EOS>
This
stopped
the
discussion
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bruff
collected
his
papers
,
looking
a
little
exhausted
by
the
demands
which
our
conversation
had
made
on
him
.
<EOS>
I
took
up
my
bag
-
full
of
precious
publications
,
feeling
as
if
I
could
have
gone
on
talking
for
hours
.
<EOS>
We
proceeded
in
silence
to
Lady
Verinder
's
room
.
  
<EOS>
Permit
me
to
add
here
,
before
my
narrative
advances
to
other
events
,
that
I
have
not
described
what
passed
between
the
lawyer
and
me
,
without
having
a
definite
object
in
view
.
<EOS>
I
am
ordered
to
include
in
my
contribution
to
the
shocking
story
of
the
Moonstone
a
plain
disclosure
,
not
only
of
the
turn
which
suspicion
took
,
but
even
of
the
names
of
the
persons
on
whom
suspicion
rested
,
at
the
time
when
the
Indian
Diamond
was
believed
to
be
in
London
.
<EOS>
A
report
of
my
conversation
in
the
library
with
Mr.
Bruff
appeared
to
me
to
be
exactly
what
was
wanted
to
answer
this
purpose
 
<EOS>
while
,
at
the
same
time
,
it
possessed
the
great
moral
advantage
of
rendering
a
sacrifice
of
sinful
self
-
esteem
essentially
necessary
on
my
part
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
obliged
to
acknowledge
that
my
fallen
nature
got
the
better
of
me
.
<EOS>
In
making
that
humiliating
confession
,
I
get
the
better
of
my
fallen
nature
.
<EOS>
The
moral
balance
is
restored
;
the
spiritual
atmosphere
feels
clear
once
more
.
<EOS>
Dear
friends
,
we
may
go
on
again
.
    
<EOS>
The
signing
of
the
Will
was
a
much
shorter
matter
than
I
had
anticipated
.
<EOS>
It
was
hurried
over
,
to
my
thinking
,
in
indecent
haste
.
<EOS>
Samuel
,
the
footman
,
was
sent
for
to
act
as
second
witness
 
and
the
pen
was
put
at
once
into
my
aunt
's
hand
.
<EOS>
I
felt
strongly
urged
to
say
a
few
appropriate
words
on
this
solemn
occasion
.
<EOS>
But
Mr.
Bruff
's
manner
convinced
me
that
it
was
wisest
to
check
the
impulse
while
he
was
in
the
room
.
<EOS>
In
less
than
two
minutes
it
was
all
over
 
and
Samuel
(
unbenefited
by
what
I
might
have
said
)
<EOS>
had
gone
downstairs
again
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Bruff
folded
up
the
Will
,
and
then
looked
my
way
;
apparently
wondering
whether
I
did
or
did
not
mean
to
leave
him
alone
with
my
aunt
.
<EOS>
I
had
my
mission
of
mercy
to
fulfil
,
and
my
bag
of
precious
publications
ready
on
my
lap
.
<EOS>
He
might
as
well
have
expected
to
move
St.
Paul
's
Cathedral
by
looking
at
it
,
as
to
move
Me
.
<EOS>
There
was
one
merit
about
him
(
due
no
doubt
to
his
worldly
training
)
which
I
have
no
wish
to
deny
.
<EOS>
He
was
quick
at
seeing
things
.
<EOS>
I
appeared
to
produce
almost
the
same
impression
on
him
which
I
had
produced
on
the
cabman
.
<EOS>
HE
too
uttered
a
profane
expression
,
and
withdrew
in
a
violent
hurry
,
and
left
me
mistress
of
the
field
.
  
<EOS>
As
soon
as
we
were
alone
,
my
aunt
reclined
on
the
sofa
,
and
then
alluded
,
with
some
appearance
of
confusion
,
to
the
subject
of
her
Will
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
wo
n't
think
yourself
neglected
,
Drusilla
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
mean
to
GIVE
you
your
little
legacy
,
my
dear
,
with
my
own
hand
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Here
was
a
golden
opportunity
!
<EOS>
I
seized
it
on
the
spot
.
<EOS>
In
other
words
,
I
instantly
opened
my
bag
,
and
took
out
the
top
publication
.
<EOS>
It
proved
to
be
an
early
edition
 
<EOS>
only
the
twenty
-
fifth
 
of
the
famous
anonymous
work
(
believed
to
be
by
precious
Miss
Bellows
)
,
entitled
THE
SERPENT
AT
HOME
.
<EOS>
The
design
of
the
book
 
with
which
the
worldly
reader
may
not
be
acquainted
 
is
to
show
how
the
Evil
One
lies
in
wait
for
us
in
all
the
most
apparently
innocent
actions
of
our
daily
lives
.
<EOS>
The
chapters
best
adapted
to
female
perusal
are
"
Satan
in
the
Hair
Brush
;
"
"
Satan
behind
the
Looking
Glass
;
"
"
Satan
under
the
Tea
Table
;
"
"
Satan
out
of
the
Window
"
 
and
many
others
.
  
<EOS>
"
Give
your
attention
,
dear
aunt
,
to
this
precious
book
 
<EOS>
and
you
will
give
me
all
I
ask
.
<EOS>
"
With
those
words
,
I
handed
it
to
her
open
,
at
a
marked
passage
 
<EOS>
one
continuous
burst
of
burning
eloquence
!
<EOS>
Subject
:
<EOS>
Satan
among
the
Sofa
Cushions
.
  
<EOS>
Poor
Lady
Verinder
(
reclining
thoughtlessly
on
her
own
sofa
cushions
)
glanced
at
the
book
,
and
handed
it
back
to
me
looking
more
confused
than
ever
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
afraid
,
Drusilla
,
"
she
said
,
"
I
must
wait
till
I
am
a
little
better
,
before
I
can
read
that
.
<EOS>
The
doctor
 
"
  
<EOS>
The
moment
she
mentioned
the
doctor
's
name
,
I
knew
what
was
coming
.
<EOS>
Over
and
over
again
in
my
past
experience
among
my
perishing
fellow
-
creatures
,
the
members
of
the
notoriously
infidel
profession
of
Medicine
had
stepped
between
me
and
my
mission
of
mercy
 
on
the
miserable
pretence
that
the
patient
wanted
quiet
,
and
that
the
disturbing
influence
of
all
others
which
they
most
dreaded
,
was
the
influence
of
Miss
Clack
and
her
Books
.
<EOS>
Precisely
the
same
blinded
materialism
(
working
treacherously
behind
my
back
)
now
sought
to
rob
me
of
the
only
right
of
property
that
my
poverty
could
claim
 
my
right
of
spiritual
property
in
my
perishing
aunt
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
doctor
tells
me
,
"
my
poor
misguided
relative
went
on
,
"
that
I
am
not
so
well
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
He
forbids
me
to
see
any
strangers
;
and
he
orders
me
,
if
I
read
at
all
,
only
to
read
the
lightest
and
the
most
amusing
books
.
<EOS>
"
Do
nothing
,
Lady
Verinder
,
to
weary
your
head
,
or
to
quicken
your
pulse
"
 
those
were
his
last
words
,
Drusilla
,
when
he
left
me
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
no
help
for
it
but
to
yield
again
 
for
the
moment
only
,
as
before
.
<EOS>
Any
open
assertion
of
the
infinitely
superior
importance
of
such
a
ministry
as
mine
,
compared
with
the
ministry
of
the
medical
man
,
would
only
have
provoked
the
doctor
to
practise
on
the
human
weakness
of
his
patient
,
and
to
threaten
to
throw
up
the
case
.
<EOS>
Happily
,
there
are
more
ways
than
one
of
sowing
the
good
seed
,
and
few
persons
are
better
versed
in
those
ways
than
myself
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
might
feel
stronger
,
dear
,
in
an
hour
or
two
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
Or
you
might
wake
,
to
-
morrow
morning
,
with
a
sense
of
something
wanting
,
and
even
this
unpretending
volume
might
be
able
to
supply
it
.
<EOS>
You
will
let
me
leave
the
book
,
aunt
?
<EOS>
The
doctor
can
hardly
object
to
that
!
"
  
<EOS>
I
slipped
it
under
the
sofa
cushions
,
half
in
,
and
half
out
,
close
by
her
handkerchief
,
and
her
smelling
-
bottle
.
<EOS>
Every
time
her
hand
searched
for
either
of
these
,
it
would
touch
the
book
;
and
,
sooner
or
later
(
who
knows
?
)
<EOS>
the
book
might
touch
HER
.
<EOS>
After
making
this
arrangement
,
I
thought
it
wise
to
withdraw
.
<EOS>
"
Let
me
leave
you
to
repose
,
dear
aunt
;
I
will
call
again
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
I
looked
accidentally
towards
the
window
as
I
said
that
.
<EOS>
It
was
full
of
flowers
,
in
boxes
and
pots
.
<EOS>
Lady
Verinder
was
extravagantly
fond
of
these
perishable
treasures
,
and
had
a
habit
of
rising
every
now
and
then
,
and
going
to
look
at
them
and
smell
them
.
<EOS>
A
new
idea
flashed
across
my
mind
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
may
I
take
a
flower
?
<EOS>
"
I
said
 
and
got
to
the
window
unsuspected
,
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
Instead
of
taking
away
a
flower
,
I
added
one
,
in
the
shape
of
another
book
from
my
bag
,
which
I
left
,
to
surprise
my
aunt
,
among
the
geraniums
and
roses
.
<EOS>
The
happy
thought
followed
,
"
Why
not
do
the
same
for
her
,
poor
dear
,
in
every
other
room
that
she
enters
?
<EOS>
"
I
immediately
said
good
-
bye
;
and
,
crossing
the
hall
,
slipped
into
the
library
.
<EOS>
Samuel
,
coming
up
to
let
me
out
,
and
supposing
I
had
gone
,
went
down
-
stairs
again
.
<EOS>
On
the
library
table
I
noticed
two
of
the
"
amusing
books
"
which
the
infidel
doctor
had
recommended
.
<EOS>
I
instantly
covered
them
from
sight
with
two
of
my
own
precious
publications
.
<EOS>
In
the
breakfast
-
room
I
found
my
aunt
's
favourite
canary
singing
in
his
cage
.
<EOS>
She
was
always
in
the
habit
of
feeding
the
bird
herself
.
<EOS>
Some
groundsel
was
strewed
on
a
table
which
stood
immediately
under
the
cage
.
<EOS>
I
put
a
book
among
the
groundsel
.
<EOS>
In
the
drawing
-
room
I
found
more
cheering
opportunities
of
emptying
my
bag
.
<EOS>
My
aunt
's
favourite
musical
pieces
were
on
the
piano
.
<EOS>
I
slipped
in
two
more
books
among
the
music
.
<EOS>
I
disposed
of
another
in
the
back
drawing
-
room
,
under
some
unfinished
embroidery
,
which
I
knew
to
be
of
Lady
Verinder
's
working
.
<EOS>
A
third
little
room
opened
out
of
the
back
drawing
-
room
,
from
which
it
was
shut
off
by
curtains
instead
of
a
door
.
<EOS>
My
aunt
's
plain
old
-
fashioned
fan
was
on
the
chimney
-
piece
.
<EOS>
I
opened
my
ninth
book
at
a
very
special
passage
,
and
put
the
fan
in
as
a
marker
,
to
keep
the
place
.
<EOS>
The
question
then
came
,
whether
I
should
go
higher
still
,
and
try
the
bed
-
room
floor
 
at
the
risk
,
undoubtedly
,
of
being
insulted
,
if
the
person
with
the
cap
-
ribbons
happened
to
be
in
the
upper
regions
of
the
house
,
and
to
find
me
out
.
<EOS>
But
oh
,
what
of
that
?
<EOS>
It
is
a
poor
Christian
that
is
afraid
of
being
insulted
.
<EOS>
I
went
upstairs
,
prepared
to
bear
anything
.
<EOS>
All
was
silent
and
solitary
 
<EOS>
it
was
the
servants
'
tea
-
time
,
I
suppose
.
<EOS>
My
aunt
's
room
was
in
front
.
<EOS>
The
miniature
of
my
late
dear
uncle
,
Sir
John
,
hung
on
the
wall
opposite
the
bed
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
to
smile
at
me
;
it
seemed
to
say
,
"
Drusilla
!
<EOS>
deposit
a
book
.
<EOS>
"
There
were
tables
on
either
side
of
my
aunt
's
bed
.
<EOS>
She
was
a
bad
sleeper
,
and
wanted
,
or
thought
she
wanted
,
many
things
at
night
.
<EOS>
I
put
a
book
near
the
matches
on
one
side
,
and
a
book
under
the
box
of
chocolate
drops
on
the
other
.
<EOS>
Whether
she
wanted
a
light
,
or
whether
she
wanted
a
drop
,
there
was
a
precious
publication
to
meet
her
eye
,
or
to
meet
her
hand
,
and
to
say
with
silent
eloquence
,
in
either
case
,
"
Come
,
try
me
!
<EOS>
try
me
!
"
<EOS>
But
one
book
was
now
left
at
the
bottom
of
my
bag
,
and
but
one
apartment
was
still
unexplored
 
<EOS>
the
bath
-
room
,
which
opened
out
of
the
bed
-
room
.
<EOS>
I
peeped
in
;
and
the
holy
inner
voice
that
never
deceives
,
whispered
to
me
,
"
<EOS>
You
have
met
her
,
Drusilla
,
everywhere
else
;
meet
her
at
the
bath
,
and
the
work
is
done
.
<EOS>
"
I
observed
a
dressing
-
gown
thrown
across
a
chair
.
<EOS>
It
had
a
pocket
in
it
,
and
in
that
pocket
I
put
my
last
book
.
<EOS>
Can
words
express
my
exquisite
sense
of
duty
done
,
when
I
had
slipped
out
of
the
house
,
unsuspected
by
any
of
them
,
and
when
I
found
myself
in
the
street
with
my
empty
bag
under
my
arm
?
<EOS>
Oh
,
my
worldly
friends
,
pursuing
the
phantom
,
Pleasure
,
through
the
guilty
mazes
of
Dissipation
,
how
easy
it
is
to
be
happy
,
if
you
will
only
be
good
!
  
<EOS>
When
I
folded
up
my
things
that
night
 
when
I
reflected
on
the
true
riches
which
I
had
scattered
with
such
a
lavish
hand
,
from
top
to
bottom
of
the
house
of
my
wealthy
aunt
 
<EOS>
I
declare
I
felt
as
free
from
all
anxiety
as
if
I
had
been
a
child
again
.
<EOS>
I
was
so
light
-
hearted
that
I
sang
a
verse
of
the
Evening
Hymn
.
<EOS>
I
was
so
light
-
hearted
that
I
fell
asleep
before
I
could
sing
another
.
<EOS>
Quite
like
a
child
again
!
<EOS>
quite
like
a
child
again
!
  
<EOS>
So
I
passed
that
blissful
night
.
<EOS>
On
rising
the
next
morning
,
how
young
I
felt
!
<EOS>
I
might
add
,
how
young
I
looked
,
if
I
were
capable
of
dwelling
on
the
concerns
of
my
own
perishable
body
.
<EOS>
But
I
am
not
capable
 
<EOS>
and
I
add
nothing
.
  
<EOS>
Towards
luncheon
time
 
not
for
the
sake
of
the
creature
-
comforts
,
but
for
the
certainty
of
finding
dear
aunt
 
<EOS>
I
put
on
my
bonnet
to
go
to
Montagu
Square
.
<EOS>
Just
as
I
was
ready
,
the
maid
at
the
lodgings
in
which
I
then
lived
looked
in
at
the
door
,
and
said
,
"
Lady
Verinder
's
servant
,
to
see
Miss
Clack
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
occupied
the
parlour
-
floor
,
at
that
period
of
my
residence
in
London
.
<EOS>
The
front
parlour
was
my
sitting
-
room
.
<EOS>
Very
small
,
very
low
in
the
ceiling
,
very
poorly
furnished
 
<EOS>
but
,
oh
,
so
neat
!
<EOS>
I
looked
into
the
passage
to
see
which
of
Lady
Verinder
's
servants
had
asked
for
me
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
young
footman
,
Samuel
 
a
civil
fresh
-
coloured
person
,
with
a
teachable
look
and
a
very
obliging
manner
.
<EOS>
I
had
always
felt
a
spiritual
interest
in
Samuel
,
and
a
wish
to
try
him
with
a
few
serious
words
.
<EOS>
On
this
occasion
,
I
invited
him
into
my
sitting
-
room
.
  
<EOS>
He
came
in
,
with
a
large
parcel
under
his
arm
.
<EOS>
When
he
put
the
parcel
down
,
it
appeared
to
frighten
him
.
<EOS>
"
My
lady
's
love
,
Miss
;
and
I
was
to
say
that
you
would
find
a
letter
inside
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Having
given
that
message
,
the
fresh
-
coloured
young
footman
surprised
me
by
looking
as
if
he
would
have
liked
to
run
away
.
  
<EOS>
I
detained
him
to
make
a
few
kind
inquiries
.
<EOS>
Could
I
see
my
aunt
,
if
I
called
in
Montagu
Square
?
<EOS>
No
;
she
had
gone
out
for
a
drive
.
<EOS>
Miss
Rachel
had
gone
with
her
,
and
Mr.
Ablewhite
had
taken
a
seat
in
the
carriage
,
too
.
<EOS>
Knowing
how
sadly
dear
Mr.
Godfrey
's
charitable
work
was
in
arrear
,
I
thought
it
odd
that
he
should
be
going
out
driving
,
like
an
idle
man
.
<EOS>
I
stopped
Samuel
at
the
door
,
and
made
a
few
more
kind
inquiries
.
<EOS>
Miss
Rachel
was
going
to
a
ball
that
night
,
and
Mr.
Ablewhite
had
arranged
to
come
to
coffee
,
and
go
with
her
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
morning
concert
advertised
for
to
-
morrow
,
and
Samuel
was
ordered
to
take
places
for
a
large
party
,
including
a
place
for
Mr.
Ablewhite
.
<EOS>
"
All
the
tickets
may
be
gone
,
Miss
,
"
said
this
innocent
youth
,
"
if
I
do
n't
run
and
get
them
at
once
!
"
<EOS>
He
ran
as
he
said
the
words
 
<EOS>
and
I
found
myself
alone
again
,
with
some
anxious
thoughts
to
occupy
me
.
  
<EOS>
We
had
a
special
meeting
of
the
Mothers'-Small
-
Clothes
-
Conversion
Society
that
night
,
summoned
expressly
with
a
view
to
obtaining
Mr.
Godfrey
's
advice
and
assistance
.
<EOS>
Instead
of
sustaining
our
sisterhood
,
under
an
overwhelming
flow
of
Trousers
which
quite
prostrated
our
little
community
,
he
had
arranged
to
take
coffee
in
Montagu
Square
,
and
to
goto
a
ball
afterwards
!
<EOS>
The
afternoon
of
the
next
day
had
been
selected
for
the
Festival
of
the
British
-
Ladies'-Servants'-Sunday
-
Sweetheart
-
Supervision
Society
.
<EOS>
Instead
of
being
present
,
the
life
and
soul
of
that
struggling
Institution
,
he
had
engaged
to
make
one
of
a
party
of
worldlings
at
a
morning
concert
!
<EOS>
I
asked
myself
what
did
it
mean
?
<EOS>
Alas
!
<EOS>
it
meant
that
our
Christian
Hero
was
to
reveal
himself
to
me
in
a
new
character
,
and
to
become
associated
in
my
mind
with
one
of
the
most
awful
backslidings
of
modern
times
.
  
<EOS>
To
return
,
however
,
to
the
history
of
the
passing
day
.
<EOS>
On
finding
myself
alone
in
my
room
,
I
naturally
turned
my
attention
to
the
parcel
which
appeared
to
have
so
strangely
intimidated
the
fresh
-
coloured
young
footman
.
<EOS>
Had
my
aunt
sent
me
my
promised
legacy
?
<EOS>
and
had
it
taken
the
form
of
cast
-
off
clothes
,
or
worn
-
out
silver
spoons
,
or
unfashionable
jewellery
,
or
anything
of
that
sort
?
<EOS>
Prepared
to
accept
all
,
and
to
resent
nothing
,
I
opened
the
parcel
 
and
what
met
my
view
?
<EOS>
The
twelve
precious
publications
which
I
had
scattered
through
the
house
,
on
the
previous
day
;
all
returned
to
me
by
the
doctor
's
orders
!
<EOS>
Well
might
the
youthful
Samuel
shrink
when
he
brought
his
parcel
into
my
room
!
<EOS>
Well
might
he
run
when
he
had
performed
his
miserable
errand
!
<EOS>
As
to
my
aunt
's
letter
,
it
simply
amounted
,
poor
soul
,
to
this
 
that
she
dare
not
disobey
her
medical
man
.
  
<EOS>
What
was
to
be
done
now
?
<EOS>
With
my
training
and
my
principles
,
I
never
had
a
moment
's
doubt
.
  
<EOS>
Once
self
-
supported
by
conscience
,
once
embarked
on
a
career
of
manifest
usefulness
,
the
true
Christian
never
yields
.
<EOS>
Neither
public
nor
private
influences
produce
the
slightest
effect
on
us
,
when
we
have
once
got
our
mission
.
<EOS>
Taxation
may
be
the
consequence
of
a
mission
;
riots
may
be
the
consequence
of
a
mission
;
wars
may
be
the
consequence
of
a
mission
:
we
go
on
with
our
work
,
irrespective
of
every
human
consideration
which
moves
the
world
outside
us
.
<EOS>
We
are
above
reason
;
we
are
beyond
ridicule
;
we
see
with
nobody
's
eyes
,
we
hear
with
nobody
's
ears
,
we
feel
with
nobody
's
hearts
,
but
our
own
.
<EOS>
Glorious
,
glorious
privilege
!
<EOS>
And
how
is
it
earned
?
<EOS>
Ah
,
my
friends
,
you
may
spare
yourselves
the
useless
inquiry
!
<EOS>
We
are
the
only
people
who
can
earn
it
 
for
we
are
the
only
people
who
are
always
right
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
case
of
my
misguided
aunt
,
the
form
which
pious
perseverance
was
next
to
take
revealed
itself
to
me
plainly
enough
.
  
<EOS>
Preparation
by
clerical
friends
had
failed
,
owing
to
Lady
Verinder
's
own
reluctance
.
<EOS>
Preparation
by
books
had
failed
,
owing
to
the
doctor
's
infidel
obstinacy
.
<EOS>
So
be
it
!
<EOS>
What
was
the
next
thing
to
try
?
<EOS>
The
next
thing
to
try
was
 
Preparation
by
Little
Notes
.
<EOS>
In
other
words
,
the
books
themselves
having
been
sent
back
,
select
extracts
from
the
books
,
copied
by
different
hands
,
and
all
addressed
as
letters
to
my
aunt
,
were
,
some
to
be
sent
by
post
,
and
some
to
be
distributed
about
the
house
on
the
plan
I
had
adopted
on
the
previous
day
.
<EOS>
As
letters
they
would
excite
no
suspicion
;
as
letters
they
would
be
opened
 
and
,
once
opened
,
might
be
read
.
<EOS>
Some
of
them
I
wrote
myself
.
"
<EOS>
Dear
aunt
,
may
I
ask
your
attention
to
a
few
lines
?
"
&
c.
"
<EOS>
Dear
aunt
,
I
was
reading
last
night
,
and
I
chanced
on
the
following
passage
,
"
&
<EOS>
c.
Other
letters
were
written
for
me
by
my
valued
fellow
-
workers
,
the
sisterhood
at
the
Mothers'-Small
-
Clothes
.
"
<EOS>
Dear
madam
,
pardon
the
interest
taken
in
you
by
a
true
,
though
humble
,
friend
.
"
<EOS>
"
Dear
madam
,
may
a
serious
person
surprise
you
by
saying
a
few
cheering
words
?
"
<EOS>
Using
these
and
other
similar
forms
of
courteous
appeal
,
we
reintroduced
all
my
precious
passages
under
a
form
which
not
even
the
doctor
's
watchful
materialism
could
suspect
.
<EOS>
Before
the
shades
of
evening
had
closed
around
us
,
I
had
a
dozen
awakening
letters
for
my
aunt
,
instead
of
a
dozen
awakening
books
.
<EOS>
Six
I
made
immediate
arrangements
for
sending
through
the
post
,
and
six
I
kept
in
my
pocket
for
personal
distribution
in
the
house
the
next
day
.
  
<EOS>
Soon
after
two
o'clock
I
was
again
on
the
field
of
pious
conflict
,
addressing
more
kind
inquiries
to
Samuel
at
Lady
Verinder
's
door
.
  
<EOS>
My
aunt
had
had
a
bad
night
.
<EOS>
She
was
again
in
the
room
in
which
I
had
witnessed
her
Will
,
resting
on
the
sofa
,
and
trying
to
get
a
little
sleep
.
  
<EOS>
I
said
I
would
wait
in
the
library
,
on
the
chance
of
seeing
her
.
<EOS>
In
the
fervour
of
my
zeal
to
distribute
the
letters
,
it
never
occurred
to
me
to
inquire
about
Rachel
.
<EOS>
The
house
was
quiet
,
and
it
was
past
the
hour
at
which
the
musical
performance
began
.
<EOS>
I
took
it
for
granted
that
she
and
her
party
of
pleasure
-
seekers
(
Mr.
Godfrey
,
alas
!
<EOS>
included
)
were
all
at
the
concert
,
and
eagerly
devoted
myself
to
my
good
work
,
while
time
and
opportunity
were
still
at
my
own
disposal
.
  
<EOS>
My
aunt
's
correspondence
of
the
morning
 
including
the
six
awakening
letters
which
I
had
posted
overnight
 
was
lying
unopened
on
the
library
table
.
<EOS>
She
had
evidently
not
felt
herself
equal
to
dealing
with
a
large
mass
of
letters
 
<EOS>
and
she
might
be
daunted
by
the
number
of
them
,
if
she
entered
the
library
later
in
the
day
.
<EOS>
I
put
one
of
my
second
set
of
six
letters
on
the
chimney
-
piece
by
itself
;
leaving
it
to
attract
her
curiosity
,
by
means
of
its
solitary
position
,
apart
from
the
rest
.
<EOS>
A
second
letter
I
put
purposely
on
the
floor
in
the
breakfast
-
room
.
<EOS>
The
first
servant
who
went
in
after
me
would
conclude
that
my
aunt
had
dropped
it
,
and
would
be
specially
careful
to
restore
it
to
her
.
<EOS>
The
field
thus
sown
on
the
basement
story
,
I
ran
lightly
upstairs
to
scatter
my
mercies
next
over
the
drawing
-
room
floor
.
  
<EOS>
Just
as
I
entered
the
front
room
,
I
heard
a
double
knock
at
the
street
-
door
 
a
soft
,
fluttering
,
considerate
little
knock
.
<EOS>
Before
I
could
think
of
slipping
back
to
the
library
(
in
which
I
was
supposed
to
be
waiting
)
,
the
active
young
footman
was
in
the
hall
,
answering
the
door
.
<EOS>
It
mattered
little
,
as
I
thought
.
<EOS>
In
my
aunt
's
state
of
health
,
visitors
in
general
were
not
admitted
.
<EOS>
To
my
horror
and
amazement
,
the
performer
of
the
soft
little
knock
proved
to
be
an
exception
to
general
rules
.
<EOS>
Samuel
's
voice
below
me
(
after
apparently
answering
some
questions
which
I
did
not
hear
)
said
,
unmistakably
,
"
Upstairs
,
if
you
please
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
The
next
moment
I
heard
footsteps
 
<EOS>
a
man
's
footsteps
 
approaching
the
drawing
-
room
floor
.
<EOS>
Who
could
this
favoured
male
visitor
possibly
be
?
<EOS>
Almost
as
soon
as
I
asked
myself
the
question
,
the
answer
occurred
to
me
.
<EOS>
Who
COULD
it
be
but
the
doctor
?
  
<EOS>
In
the
case
of
any
other
visitor
,
I
should
have
allowed
myself
to
be
discovered
in
the
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
There
would
have
been
nothing
out
of
the
common
in
my
having
got
tired
of
the
library
,
and
having
gone
upstairs
for
a
change
.
<EOS>
But
my
own
self
-
respect
stood
in
the
way
of
my
meeting
the
person
who
had
insulted
me
by
sending
me
back
my
books
.
<EOS>
I
slipped
into
the
little
third
room
,
which
I
have
mentioned
as
communicating
with
the
back
drawing
-
room
,
and
dropped
the
curtains
which
closed
the
open
doorway
.
<EOS>
If
I
only
waited
there
for
a
minute
or
two
,
the
usual
result
in
such
cases
would
take
place
.
<EOS>
That
is
to
say
,
the
doctor
would
be
conducted
to
his
patient
's
room
.
  
<EOS>
I
waited
a
minute
or
two
,
and
more
than
a
minute
or
two
.
<EOS>
I
heard
the
visitor
walking
restlessly
backwards
and
forwards
.
<EOS>
I
also
heard
him
talking
to
himself
.
<EOS>
I
even
thought
I
recognised
the
voice
.
<EOS>
Had
I
made
a
mistake
?
<EOS>
Was
it
not
the
doctor
,
but
somebody
else
?
<EOS>
Mr.
Bruff
,
for
instance
?
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
an
unerring
instinct
told
me
it
was
not
Mr.
Bruff
.
<EOS>
Whoever
he
was
,
he
was
still
talking
to
himself
.
<EOS>
I
parted
the
heavy
curtains
the
least
little
morsel
in
the
world
,
and
listened
.
  
<EOS>
The
words
I
heard
were
,
"
I
'll
do
it
to
-
day
!
"
<EOS>
And
the
voice
that
spoke
them
was
Mr.
Godfrey
Ablewhite
's
.
    
<EOS>
My
hand
dropped
from
the
curtain
.
<EOS>
But
do
n't
suppose
 
oh
,
do
n't
suppose
 
that
the
dreadful
embarrassment
of
my
situation
was
the
uppermost
idea
in
my
mind
!
<EOS>
So
fervent
still
was
the
sisterly
interest
I
felt
in
Mr.
Godfrey
,
that
I
never
stopped
to
ask
myself
why
he
was
not
at
the
concert
.
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
I
thought
only
of
the
words
 
<EOS>
the
startling
words
 
which
had
just
fallen
from
his
lips
.
<EOS>
He
would
do
it
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
He
had
said
,
in
a
tone
of
terrible
resolution
,
he
would
do
it
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
What
,
<EOS>
oh
what
,
would
he
do
?
<EOS>
Something
even
more
deplorably
unworthy
of
him
than
what
he
had
done
already
?
<EOS>
Would
he
apostatise
from
the
faith
?
<EOS>
Would
he
abandon
us
at
the
Mothers'-Small
-
Clothes
?
<EOS>
Had
we
seen
the
last
of
his
angelic
smile
in
the
committee
-
room
?
<EOS>
Had
we
heard
the
last
of
his
unrivalled
eloquence
at
Exeter
Hall
?
<EOS>
I
was
so
wrought
up
by
the
bare
idea
of
such
awful
eventualities
as
these
in
connection
with
such
a
man
,
<EOS>
that
I
believe
I
should
have
rushed
from
my
place
of
concealment
,
and
implored
him
in
the
name
of
all
the
Ladies
'
Committees
in
London
to
explain
himself
 
when
I
suddenly
heard
another
voice
in
the
room
.
<EOS>
It
penetrated
through
the
curtains
;
it
was
loud
,
it
was
bold
,
it
was
wanting
in
every
female
charm
.
<EOS>
The
voice
of
Rachel
Verinder
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
have
you
come
up
here
,
Godfrey
?
<EOS>
"
she
asked
.
<EOS>
"
Why
did
n't
you
go
into
the
library
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
laughed
softly
,
and
answered
,
"
Miss
Clack
is
in
the
library
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Clack
in
the
library
!
"
<EOS>
She
instantly
seated
herself
on
the
ottoman
in
the
back
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
quite
right
,
Godfrey
.
<EOS>
We
had
much
better
stop
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
had
been
in
a
burning
fever
,
a
moment
since
,
and
in
some
doubt
what
to
do
next
.
<EOS>
I
became
extremely
cold
now
,
and
felt
no
doubt
whatever
.
<EOS>
To
show
myself
,
after
what
I
had
heard
,
was
impossible
.
<EOS>
To
retreat
 
except
into
the
fireplace
 
was
equally
out
of
the
question
.
<EOS>
A
martyrdom
was
before
me
.
<EOS>
In
justice
to
myself
,
I
noiselessly
arranged
the
curtains
so
that
I
could
both
see
and
hear
.
<EOS>
And
then
I
met
my
martyrdom
,
with
the
spirit
of
a
primitive
Christian
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
sit
on
the
ottoman
,
"
the
young
lady
proceeded
.
<EOS>
"
Bring
a
chair
,
Godfrey
.
<EOS>
I
like
people
to
be
opposite
to
me
when
I
talk
to
them
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
took
the
nearest
seat
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
low
chair
.
<EOS>
He
was
very
tall
,
and
many
sizes
too
large
for
it
.
<EOS>
I
never
saw
his
legs
to
such
disadvantage
before
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
?
"
she
went
on
.
<EOS>
"
What
did
you
say
to
them
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Just
what
you
said
,
dear
Rachel
,
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
mamma
was
not
at
all
well
to
-
day
?
<EOS>
And
that
I
did
n't
quite
like
leaving
her
to
go
to
the
concert
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Those
were
the
words
.
<EOS>
They
were
grieved
to
lose
you
at
the
concert
,
but
they
quite
understood
.
<EOS>
All
sent
their
love
;
and
all
expressed
a
cheering
belief
that
Lady
Verinder
's
indisposition
would
soon
pass
away
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
YOU
do
n't
think
it
's
serious
,
do
you
,
Godfrey
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Far
from
it
!
<EOS>
In
a
few
days
,
I
feel
quite
sure
,
all
will
be
well
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
so
,
too
.
<EOS>
I
was
a
little
frightened
at
first
,
but
I
think
so
too
.
<EOS>
It
was
very
kind
to
go
and
make
my
excuses
for
me
to
people
who
are
almost
strangers
to
you
.
<EOS>
But
why
not
have
gone
with
them
to
the
concert
?
<EOS>
It
seems
very
hard
that
you
should
miss
the
music
too
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
n't
say
that
,
Rachel
!
<EOS>
If
you
only
knew
how
much
happier
I
am
 
here
,
with
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
clasped
his
hands
,
and
looked
at
her
.
<EOS>
In
the
position
which
he
occupied
,
when
he
did
that
,
he
turned
my
way
.
<EOS>
Can
words
describe
how
I
sickened
when
I
noticed
exactly
the
same
pathetic
expression
on
his
face
,
which
had
charmed
me
when
he
was
pleading
for
destitute
millions
of
his
fellow
-
creatures
on
the
platform
at
Exeter
Hall
!
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
hard
to
get
over
one
's
bad
habits
,
Godfrey
.
<EOS>
But
do
try
to
get
over
the
habit
of
paying
compliments
 
<EOS>
do
,
to
please
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
paid
you
a
compliment
,
Rachel
,
in
my
life
.
<EOS>
Successful
love
may
sometimes
use
the
language
of
flattery
,
I
admit
.
<EOS>
But
hopeless
love
,
dearest
,
always
speaks
the
truth
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
drew
his
chair
close
,
and
took
her
hand
,
when
he
said
"
hopeless
love
.
<EOS>
"
There
was
a
momentary
silence
.
<EOS>
He
,
who
thrilled
everybody
,
had
doubtless
thrilled
HER
.
<EOS>
I
thought
I
now
understood
the
words
which
had
dropped
from
him
when
he
was
alone
in
the
drawing
-
room
,
"
I
'll
do
it
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Alas
!
<EOS>
the
most
rigid
propriety
could
hardly
have
failed
to
discover
that
he
was
doing
it
now
.
  
<EOS>
"
Have
you
forgotten
what
we
agreed
on
,
Godfrey
,
when
you
spoke
to
me
in
the
country
?
<EOS>
We
agreed
that
we
were
to
be
cousins
,
and
nothing
more
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
break
the
agreement
,
Rachel
,
every
time
I
see
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
do
n't
see
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Quite
useless
!
<EOS>
I
break
the
agreement
every
time
I
think
of
you
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
Rachel
!
<EOS>
how
kindly
you
told
me
,
only
the
other
day
,
that
my
place
in
your
estimation
was
a
higher
place
than
it
had
ever
been
yet
!
<EOS>
Am
I
mad
to
build
the
hopes
I
do
on
those
dear
words
?
<EOS>
Am
I
mad
to
dream
of
some
future
day
when
your
heart
may
soften
to
me
?
<EOS>
Do
n't
tell
me
so
,
if
I
am
!
<EOS>
Leave
me
my
delusion
,
dearest
!
<EOS>
I
must
have
THAT
to
cherish
,
and
to
comfort
me
,
if
I
have
nothing
else
!
"
  
<EOS>
His
voice
trembled
,
and
he
put
his
white
handkerchief
to
his
eyes
.
<EOS>
Exeter
Hall
again
!
<EOS>
Nothing
wanting
to
complete
the
parallel
but
the
audience
,
the
cheers
,
and
the
glass
of
water
.
  
<EOS>
Even
her
obdurate
nature
was
touched
.
<EOS>
I
saw
her
lean
a
little
nearer
to
him
.
<EOS>
I
heard
a
new
tone
of
interest
in
her
next
words
.
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
really
sure
,
Godfrey
,
that
you
are
so
fond
of
me
as
that
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Sure
!
<EOS>
You
know
what
I
was
,
Rachel
.
<EOS>
Let
me
tell
you
what
I
am
.
<EOS>
I
have
lost
every
interest
in
life
,
but
my
interest
in
you
.
<EOS>
A
transformation
has
come
over
me
which
I
ca
n't
account
for
,
myself
.
<EOS>
Would
you
believe
it
?
<EOS>
My
charitable
business
is
an
unendurable
nuisance
to
me
;
and
when
I
see
a
Ladies
'
Committee
now
,
I
wish
myself
at
the
uttermost
ends
of
the
earth
!
"
  
<EOS>
If
the
annals
of
apostasy
offer
anything
comparable
to
such
a
declaration
as
that
,
I
can
only
say
that
the
case
in
point
is
not
producible
from
the
stores
of
my
reading
.
<EOS>
I
thought
of
the
Mothers'-Small
-
Clothes
.
<EOS>
I
thought
of
the
Sunday
-
Sweetheart
-
Supervision
.
<EOS>
I
thought
of
the
other
Societies
,
too
numerous
to
mention
,
all
built
up
on
this
man
as
on
a
tower
of
strength
.
<EOS>
I
thought
of
the
struggling
Female
Boards
,
who
,
so
to
speak
,
drew
the
breath
of
their
business
-
life
through
the
nostrils
of
Mr.
Godfrey
 
of
that
same
Mr.
Godfrey
who
had
just
reviled
our
good
work
as
a
"
nuisance
"
 
and
just
declared
that
he
wished
he
was
at
the
uttermost
ends
of
the
earth
when
he
found
himself
in
our
company
!
<EOS>
My
young
female
friends
will
feel
encouraged
to
persevere
,
when
I
mention
that
it
tried
even
My
discipline
before
I
could
devour
my
own
righteous
indignation
in
silence
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
,
it
is
only
justice
to
myself
to
add
,
that
I
did
n't
lose
a
syllable
of
the
conversation
.
<EOS>
Rachel
was
the
next
to
speak
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
made
your
confession
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
whether
it
would
cure
you
of
your
unhappy
attachment
to
me
,
if
I
made
mine
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
started
.
<EOS>
I
confess
I
started
too
.
<EOS>
He
thought
,
and
I
thought
,
that
she
was
about
to
divulge
the
mystery
of
the
Moonstone
.
  
<EOS>
"
Would
you
think
,
to
look
at
me
,
"
she
went
on
,
"
that
I
am
the
wretchedest
girl
living
?
<EOS>
It
's
true
,
Godfrey
.
<EOS>
What
greater
wretchedness
can
there
be
than
to
live
degraded
in
your
own
estimation
?
<EOS>
That
is
my
life
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Rachel
!
<EOS>
it
's
impossible
you
can
have
any
reason
to
speak
of
yourself
in
that
way
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
know
I
have
no
reason
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Can
you
ask
me
the
question
!
<EOS>
I
know
it
,
because
I
know
you
.
<EOS>
Your
silence
,
dearest
,
has
never
lowered
you
in
the
estimation
of
your
true
friends
.
<EOS>
The
disappearance
of
your
precious
birthday
gift
may
seem
strange
;
your
unexplained
connection
with
that
event
may
seem
stranger
still
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Are
you
speaking
of
the
Moonstone
,
Godfrey
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
certainly
thought
that
you
referred
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
referred
to
nothing
of
the
sort
.
<EOS>
I
can
hear
of
the
loss
of
the
Moonstone
,
let
who
will
speak
of
it
,
without
feeling
degraded
in
my
own
estimation
.
<EOS>
If
the
story
of
the
Diamond
ever
comes
to
light
,
it
will
be
known
that
I
accepted
a
dreadful
responsibility
;
it
will
be
known
that
I
involved
myself
in
the
keeping
of
a
miserable
secret
 
but
it
will
be
as
clear
as
the
sun
at
noon
-
day
that
I
did
nothing
mean
!
<EOS>
You
have
misunderstood
me
,
Godfrey
.
<EOS>
It
's
my
fault
for
not
speaking
more
plainly
.
<EOS>
Cost
me
what
it
may
,
I
will
be
plainer
now
.
<EOS>
Suppose
you
were
not
in
love
with
me
?
<EOS>
Suppose
you
were
in
love
with
some
other
woman
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Suppose
you
discovered
that
woman
to
be
utterly
unworthy
of
you
?
<EOS>
Suppose
you
were
quite
convinced
that
it
was
a
disgrace
to
you
to
waste
another
thought
on
her
?
<EOS>
Suppose
the
bare
idea
of
ever
marrying
such
a
person
made
your
face
burn
,
only
with
thinking
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
,
suppose
,
in
spite
of
all
that
 
you
could
n't
tear
her
from
your
heart
?
<EOS>
Suppose
the
feeling
she
had
roused
in
you
(
in
the
time
when
you
believed
in
her
)
was
not
a
feeling
to
be
hidden
?
<EOS>
Suppose
the
love
this
wretch
had
inspired
in
you
?
<EOS>
Oh
,
how
can
I
find
words
to
say
it
in
!
<EOS>
How
can
I
make
a
MAN
understand
that
a
feeling
which
horrifies
me
at
myself
,
can
be
a
feeling
that
fascinates
me
at
the
same
time
?
<EOS>
It
's
the
breath
of
my
life
,
Godfrey
,
and
it
's
the
poison
that
kills
me
 
both
in
one
!
<EOS>
Go
away
!
<EOS>
I
must
be
out
of
my
mind
to
talk
as
I
am
talking
now
.
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
you
must
n't
leave
me
 
you
must
n't
carry
away
a
wrong
impression
.
<EOS>
I
must
say
what
is
to
be
said
in
my
own
defence
.
<EOS>
Mind
this
!
<EOS>
HE
does
n't
know
 
he
never
will
know
,
what
I
have
told
you
.
<EOS>
I
will
never
see
him
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
care
what
happens
 
<EOS>
I
will
never
,
never
,
never
see
him
again
!
<EOS>
Do
n't
ask
me
his
name
!
<EOS>
Do
n't
ask
me
any
more
!
<EOS>
Let
's
change
the
subject
.
<EOS>
Are
you
doctor
enough
,
Godfrey
,
to
tell
me
why
I
feel
as
if
I
was
stifling
for
want
of
breath
?
<EOS>
Is
there
a
form
of
hysterics
that
bursts
into
words
instead
of
tears
?
<EOS>
I
dare
say
!
<EOS>
What
does
it
matter
?
<EOS>
You
will
get
over
any
trouble
I
have
caused
you
,
easily
enough
now
.
<EOS>
I
have
dropped
to
my
right
place
in
your
estimation
,
have
n't
I
?
<EOS>
Do
n't
notice
me
!
<EOS>
Do
n't
pity
me
!
<EOS>
For
God
's
sake
,
go
away
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
turned
round
on
a
sudden
,
and
beat
her
hands
wildly
on
the
back
of
the
ottoman
.
<EOS>
Her
head
dropped
on
the
cushions
;
and
she
burst
out
crying
.
<EOS>
Before
I
had
time
to
feel
shocked
,
at
this
,
I
was
horror
-
struck
by
an
entirely
unexpected
proceeding
on
the
part
of
Mr.
Godfrey
.
<EOS>
Will
it
be
credited
that
he
fell
on
his
knees
at
her
feet
?
 
<EOS>
on
BOTH
knees
,
I
solemnly
declare
!
<EOS>
May
modesty
mention
that
he
put
his
arms
<EOS>
round
her
next
?
<EOS>
And
may
reluctant
admiration
acknowledge
that
he
electrified
her
with
two
words
?
  
<EOS>
"
Noble
creature
!
"
  
<EOS>
No
more
than
that
!
<EOS>
But
he
did
it
with
one
of
the
bursts
which
have
made
his
fame
as
a
public
speaker
.
<EOS>
She
sat
,
either
quite
thunderstruck
,
or
quite
fascinated
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
which
 
without
even
making
an
effort
to
put
his
arms
back
where
his
arms
ought
to
have
been
.
<EOS>
As
for
me
,
my
sense
of
propriety
was
completely
bewildered
.
<EOS>
I
was
so
painfully
uncertain
whether
it
was
my
first
duty
to
close
my
eyes
,
or
to
stop
my
ears
,
that
I
did
neither
.
<EOS>
I
attribute
my
being
still
able
to
hold
the
curtain
in
the
right
position
for
looking
and
listening
,
entirely
to
suppressed
hysterics
.
<EOS>
In
suppressed
hysterics
,
it
is
admitted
,
even
by
the
doctors
,
that
one
must
hold
something
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
he
said
,
with
all
the
fascination
of
his
evangelical
voice
and
manner
,
"
you
are
a
noble
creature
!
<EOS>
A
woman
who
can
speak
the
truth
,
for
the
truth
's
own
sake
 
a
woman
who
will
sacrifice
her
pride
,
rather
than
sacrifice
an
honest
man
who
loves
her
 
<EOS>
is
the
most
priceless
of
all
treasures
.
<EOS>
When
such
a
woman
marries
,
if
her
husband
only
wins
her
esteem
and
regard
,
he
wins
enough
to
ennoble
his
whole
life
.
<EOS>
You
have
spoken
,
dearest
,
of
your
place
in
my
estimation
.
<EOS>
Judge
what
that
place
is
 
when
I
implore
you
on
my
knees
,
to
let
the
cure
of
your
poor
wounded
heart
be
my
care
.
<EOS>
Rachel
!
<EOS>
will
you
honour
me
,
will
you
bless
me
,
by
being
my
wife
?
"
  
<EOS>
By
this
time
I
should
certainly
have
decided
on
stopping
my
ears
,
if
Rachel
had
not
encouraged
me
to
keep
them
open
,
by
answering
him
in
the
first
sensible
words
I
had
ever
heard
fall
from
her
lips
.
  
<EOS>
"
Godfrey
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
"
you
must
be
mad
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
spoke
more
reasonably
,
dearest
 
in
your
interests
,
as
well
as
in
mine
.
<EOS>
Look
for
a
moment
to
the
future
.
<EOS>
Is
your
happiness
to
be
sacrificed
to
a
man
who
has
never
known
how
you
feel
towards
him
,
and
whom
you
are
resolved
never
to
see
again
?
<EOS>
Is
it
not
your
duty
to
yourself
to
forget
this
ill
-
fated
attachment
?
<EOS>
and
is
forgetfulness
to
be
found
in
the
life
you
are
leading
now
?
<EOS>
You
have
tried
that
life
,
and
you
are
wearying
of
it
already
.
<EOS>
Surround
yourself
with
nobler
interests
than
the
wretched
interests
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
A
heart
that
loves
and
honours
you
;
a
home
whose
peaceful
claims
and
happy
duties
win
gently
on
you
day
by
day
 
try
the
consolation
,
Rachel
,
which
is
to
be
found
THERE
!
<EOS>
I
do
n't
ask
for
your
love
 
I
will
be
content
with
your
affection
and
regard
.
<EOS>
Let
the
rest
be
left
,
confidently
left
,
to
your
husband
's
devotion
,
and
to
Time
that
heals
even
wounds
as
deep
as
yours
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
began
to
yield
already
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
what
a
bringing
-
up
she
must
have
had
!
<EOS>
Oh
,
how
differently
I
should
have
acted
in
her
place
!
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
tempt
me
,
Godfrey
,
"
she
said
;
"
I
am
wretched
enough
and
reckless
enough
as
it
is
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
tempt
me
to
be
more
wretched
and
more
wreckless
still
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
One
question
,
Rachel
.
<EOS>
Have
you
any
personal
objection
to
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
!
<EOS>
I
always
liked
you
.
<EOS>
After
what
you
have
just
said
to
me
,
I
should
be
insensible
indeed
if
I
did
n't
respect
and
admire
you
as
well
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
know
many
wives
,
my
dear
Rachel
,
who
respect
and
admire
their
husbands
?
<EOS>
And
yet
they
and
their
husbands
get
on
very
well
.
<EOS>
How
many
brides
go
to
the
altar
with
hearts
that
would
bear
inspection
by
the
men
who
take
them
there
?
<EOS>
And
yet
it
does
n't
end
unhappily
 
somehow
or
other
<EOS>
the
nuptial
establishment
jogs
on
.
<EOS>
The
truth
is
,
that
women
try
marriage
as
a
Refuge
,
far
more
numerously
than
they
are
willing
to
admit
;
and
,
what
is
more
,
they
find
that
marriage
has
justified
their
confidence
in
it
.
<EOS>
Look
at
your
own
case
once
again
.
<EOS>
At
your
age
,
and
with
your
attractions
,
is
it
possible
for
you
to
sentence
yourself
to
a
single
life
?
<EOS>
Trust
my
knowledge
of
the
world
 
nothing
is
less
possible
.
<EOS>
It
is
merely
a
question
of
time
.
<EOS>
You
may
marry
some
other
man
,
some
years
hence
.
<EOS>
Or
you
may
marry
the
man
,
dearest
,
who
is
now
at
your
feet
,
and
who
prizes
your
respect
and
admiration
above
the
love
of
any
other
woman
on
the
face
of
the
earth
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Gently
,
Godfrey
!
<EOS>
you
are
putting
something
into
my
head
which
I
never
thought
of
before
.
<EOS>
You
are
tempting
me
with
a
new
prospect
,
when
all
my
other
prospects
are
closed
before
me
.
<EOS>
I
tell
you
again
,
I
am
miserable
enough
and
desperate
enough
,
if
you
say
another
word
,
to
marry
you
on
your
own
terms
.
<EOS>
Take
the
warning
,
and
go
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wo
n't
even
rise
from
my
knees
,
till
you
have
said
yes

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
say
yes
you
will
repent

I
shall
repent

when
it

too
late

<EOS>
"
We
shall
both
bless
the
day
,
darling
,
when
I
pressed
,
and
when
you
yielded
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
feel
as
confidently
as
you
speak
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
shall
judge
for
yourself
.
<EOS>
I
speak
from
what
I
have
seen
in
my
own
family
.
<EOS>
Tell
me
what
you
think
of
our
household
at
Frizinghall
.
<EOS>
Do
my
father
and
mother
live
unhappily
together

Far
from

so
far
as
I
can
see

When
my
mother
was
a
girl

Rachel
(
it
is
no
secret

,
she
had
loved
as

was
unworthy

She
married
my

respecting
him

admiring
him

but
nothing
more

give
me
yourself
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Take
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
In
those
two
words
she
accepted
him
!
  
<EOS>
He
had
another
burst
 
<EOS>
a
burst
of
unholy
rapture
this
time
.
<EOS>
He
drew
her
nearer
and
nearer
to
him
till
her
face
touched
his
;
and
then
 
No
!
<EOS>
I
really
can
not
prevail
upon
myself
to
carry
this
shocking
disclosure
any
farther
.
<EOS>
Let
me
only
say
,
that
I
tried
to
close
my
eyes
before
it
happened
,
and
that
I
was
just
one
moment
too
late
.
<EOS>
I
had
calculated
,
you
see
,
on
her
resisting
.
<EOS>
She
submitted
.
<EOS>
To
every
right
-
feeling
person
of
my
own
sex
,
volumes
could
say
no
more
.
  
<EOS>
Even
my
innocence
in
such
matters
began
to
see
its
way
to
the
end
of
the
interview
now
.
<EOS>
They
understood
each
other
so
thoroughly
by
this
time
,
that
I
fully
expected
to
see
them
walk
off
together
,
arm
in
arm
,
to
be
married
.
<EOS>
There
appeared
,
however
,
judging
by
Mr.
Godfrey
's
next
words
,
to
be
one
more
trifling
formality
which
it
was
necessary
to
observe
.
<EOS>
He
seated
himself
 
unforbidden
this
time
 
on
the
ottoman
by
her
side
.
"
<EOS>
Shall
I
speak
to
your
dear
mother
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
.
<EOS>
"
Or
will
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
declined
both
alternatives
.
  
<EOS>
"
Let
my
mother
hear
nothing
from
either
of
us
,
until
she
is
better
.
<EOS>
I
wish
it
to
be
kept
a
secret
for
the
present
,
Godfrey
.
<EOS>
Go
now
,
and
come
back
this
evening
.
<EOS>
We
have
been
here
alone
together
quite
long
enough
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
rose
,
and
in
rising
,
looked
for
the
first
time
towards
the
little
room
in
which
my
martyrdom
was
going
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
Who
has
drawn
those
curtains
?
<EOS>
"
she
exclaimed
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
room
is
close
enough
,
as
it
is
,
without
keeping
the
air
out
of
it
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
advanced
to
the
curtains
.
<EOS>
At
the
moment
when
she
laid
her
hand
on
them
 
at
the
moment
when
the
discovery
of
me
appeared
to
be
quite
inevitable
 
the
voice
of
the
fresh
-
coloured
young
footman
,
on
the
stairs
,
suddenly
suspended
any
further
proceedings
on
her
side
or
on
mine
.
<EOS>
It
was
unmistakably
the
voice
of
a
man
in
great
alarm
.
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Rachel
!
"
<EOS>
he
called
out
,
"
where
are
you
,
Miss
Rachel
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
sprang
back
from
the
curtains
,
and
ran
to
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
The
footman
came
just
inside
the
room
.
<EOS>
His
ruddy
colour
was
all
gone
.
<EOS>
He
said
,
"
Please
to
come
down
-
stairs
,
Miss
!
<EOS>
My
lady
has
fainted
,
and
we
ca
n't
bring
her
to
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
In
a
moment
more
I
was
alone
,
and
free
to
go
down
-
stairs
in
my
turn
,
quite
unobserved
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Godfrey
passed
me
in
the
hall
,
hurrying
out
,
to
fetch
the
doctor
.
"
<EOS>
Go
in
,
and
help
them
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
pointing
to
the
room
.
<EOS>
I
found
Rachel
on
her
knees
by
the
sofa
,
with
her
mother
's
head
on
her
bosom
.
<EOS>
One
look
at
my
aunt
's
face
(
knowing
what
I
knew
)
was
enough
to
warn
me
of
the
dreadful
truth
.
<EOS>
I
kept
my
thoughts
to
myself
till
the
doctor
came
in
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
long
before
he
arrived
.
<EOS>
He
began
by
sending
Rachel
out
of
the
room
 
<EOS>
and
then
he
told
the
rest
of
us
that
Lady
Verinder
was
no
more
.
<EOS>
Serious
persons
,
in
search
of
proofs
of
hardened
scepticism
,
may
be
interested
in
hearing
that
he
showed
no
signs
of
remorse
when
he
looked
at
Me
.
  
<EOS>
At
a
later
hour
I
peeped
into
the
breakfast
-
room
,
and
the
library
.
<EOS>
My
aunt
had
died
without
opening
one
of
the
letters
which
I
had
addressed
to
her
.
<EOS>
I
was
so
shocked
at
this
,
that
it
never
occurred
to
me
,
until
some
days
afterwards
,
that
she
had
also
died
without
giving
me
my
little
legacy

trouble
Mr.

the
expression

been
forbidden

Miss

is
painfully
conscious
that
she
ought
(

the
worldly

to
feel
herself
put
down

But
,
no

prohibits

She
affectionately
requests

to
retire

The
foregoing
correspondence
will
sufficiently
explain
why
no
choice
is
left
to
me
but
to
pass
over
Lady
Verinder
's
death
with
the
simple
announcement
of
the
fact
which
ends
my
fifth
chapter
.
  
<EOS>
Keeping
myself
for
the
future
strictly
within
the
limits
of
my
own
personal
experience
,
I
have
next
to
relate
that
a
month
elapsed
from
the
time
of
my
aunt
's
decease
before
Rachel
Verinder
<EOS>
and
I
met
again
.
<EOS>
That
meeting
was
the
occasion
of
my
spending
a
few
days
under
the
same
roof
with
her
.
<EOS>
In
the
course
of
my
visit
,
something
happened
,
relative
to
her
marriage
-
engagement
with
Mr.
Godfrey
Ablewhite
,
which
is
important
enough
to
require
special
notice
in
these
pages
.
<EOS>
When
this
last
of
many
painful
family
circumstances
has
been
disclosed
,
my
task
will
be
completed
;
for
I
shall
then
have
told
all
that
I
know
,
as
an
actual
(
and
most
unwilling
)
witness
of
events
.
  
<EOS>
My
aunt
's
remains
were
removed
from
London
,
and
were
buried
in
the
little
cemetery
attached
to
the
church
in
her
own
park
.
<EOS>
I
was
invited
to
the
funeral
with
the
rest
of
the
family
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
impossible
(
with
my
religious
views
)
to
rouse
myself
in
a
few
days
only
from
the
shock
which
this
death
had
caused
me
.
<EOS>
I
was
informed
,
moreover
,
that
the
rector
of
Frizinghall
was
to
read
the
service
.
<EOS>
Having
myself
in
past
times
seen
this
clerical
castaway
making
one
of
the
players
at
Lady
Verinder
's
whist
-
table
,
I
doubt
,
even
if
I
had
been
fit
to
travel
,
whether
I
should
have
felt
justified
in
attending
the
ceremony
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Verinder
's
death
left
her
daughter
under
the
care
of
her
brother
-
in
-
law
,
Mr.
Ablewhite
the
elder
.
<EOS>
He
was
appointed
guardian
by
the
will
,
until
his
niece
married
,
or
came
of
age
.
<EOS>
Under
these
circumstances
,
Mr.
Godfrey
informed
his
father
,
I
suppose
,
of
the
new
relation
in
which
he
stood
towards
Rachel
.
<EOS>
At
any
rate
,
in
ten
days
from
my
aunt
's
death
,
the
secret
of
the
marriage
-
engagement
was
no
secret
at
all
within
the
circle
of
the
family
,
and
the
grand
question
for
Mr.
Ablewhite
senior
 
another
confirmed
castaway
!
 
<EOS>
was
how
to
make
himself
and
his
authority
most
agreeable
to
the
wealthy
young
lady
who
was
going
to
marry
his
son
.
  
<EOS>
Rachel
gave
him
some
trouble
at
the
outset
,
about
the
choice
of
a
place
in
which
she
could
be
prevailed
upon
to
reside
.
<EOS>
The
house
in
Montagu
Square
was
associated
with
the
calamity
of
her
mother
's
death
.
<EOS>
The
house
in
Yorkshire
was
associated
with
the
scandalous
affair
of
the
lost
Moonstone
.
<EOS>
Her
guardian
's
own
residence
at
Frizinghall
was
open
to
neither
of
these
objections
.
<EOS>
But
Rachel
's
presence
in
it
,
after
her
recent
bereavement
,
operated
as
a
check
on
the
gaieties
of
her
cousins
,
the
Miss
Ablewhites
 
<EOS>
and
she
herself
requested
that
her
visit
might
be
deferred
to
a
more
favourable
opportunity
.
<EOS>
It
ended
in
a
proposal
,
emanating
from
old
Mr.
Ablewhite
,
to
try
a
furnished
house
at
Brighton
.
<EOS>
His
wife
,
an
invalid
daughter
,
and
Rachel
were
to
inhabit
it
together
,
and
were
to
expect
him
to
join
them
later
in
the
season
.
<EOS>
They
would
see
no
society
but
a
few
old
friends
,
and
they
would
have
his
son
Godfrey
,
travelling
backwards
and
forwards
by
the
London
train
,
always
at
their
disposal
.
  
<EOS>
I
describe
this
aimless
flitting
about
from
one
place
of
residence
to
another
 
<EOS>
this
insatiate
restlessness
of
body
and
appalling
stagnation
of
soul
 
merely
with
the
view
to
arriving
at
results
.
<EOS>
The
event
which
(
under
Providence
)
proved
to
be
the
means
of
bringing
Rachel
Verinder
and
myself
together
again
,
was
no
other
than
the
hiring
of
the
house
at
Brighton
.
  
<EOS>
My
Aunt
Ablewhite
is
a
large
,
silent
,
fair
-
complexioned
woman
,
with
one
noteworthy
point
in
her
character
.
<EOS>
From
the
hour
of
her
birth
she
has
never
been
known
to
do
anything
for
herself
.
<EOS>
She
has
gone
through
life
,
accepting
everybody
's
help
,
and
adopting
everybody
's
opinions
.
<EOS>
A
more
hopeless
person
,
in
a
spiritual
point
of
view
,
I
have
never
met
with
 
there
is
absolutely
,
in
this
perplexing
case
,
no
obstructive
material
to
work
upon
.
<EOS>
Aunt
Ablewhite
would
listen
to
the
Grand
Lama
of
Thibet
exactly
as
she
listens
to
Me
,
and
would
reflect
his
views
quite
as
readily
as
she
reflects
mine
.
<EOS>
She
found
the
furnished
house
at
Brighton
by
stopping
at
an
hotel
in
London
,
composing
herself
on
a
sofa
,
and
sending
for
her
son
.
<EOS>
She
discovered
the
necessary
servants
by
breakfasting
in
bed
one
morning
(
still
at
the
hotel
)
,
and
giving
her
maid
a
holiday
on
condition
that
the
girl
"
would
begin
enjoying
herself
by
fetching
Miss
Clack
.
<EOS>
"
I
found
her
placidly
fanning
herself
in
her
dressing
-
gown
at
eleven
o'clock
.
<EOS>
"
Drusilla
,
dear
,
I
want
some
servants
.
<EOS>
You
are
so
clever
 
please
get
them
for
me
.
<EOS>
"
I
looked
round
the
untidy
room
.
<EOS>
The
church
-
bells
were
going
for
a
week
-
day
service
;
they
suggested
a
word
of
affectionate
remonstrance
on
my
part
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
aunt
!
<EOS>
"
I
said
sadly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Is
THIS
worthy
of
a
Christian
Englishwoman
?
<EOS>
Is
the
passage
from
time
to
eternity
to
be
made
in
THIS
manner
?
<EOS>
"
My
aunt
answered
,
"
I
'll
put
on
my
gown
,
Drusilla
,
if
you
will
be
kind
enough
to
help
me
.
"
What
was
to
be
said
after
that
?
<EOS>
I
have
done
wonders
with
murderesses
 
<EOS>
I
have
never
advanced
an
inch
with
Aunt
Ablewhite
.
<EOS>
"
Where
is
the
list
,
"
I
asked
,
"
of
the
servants
whom
you
require
?
"
My
aunt
shook
her
head
;
she
had
n't
even
energy
enough
to
keep
the
list
.
"
<EOS>
Rachel
has
got
it
,
dear
,
"
she
said
,
"
in
the
next
room
.
<EOS>
"
I
went
into
the
next
room
,
and
so
saw
Rachel
again
for
the
first
time
since
we
had
parted
in
Montagu
Square
.
  
<EOS>
She
looked
pitiably
small
and
thin
in
her
deep
mourning
.
<EOS>
If
I
attached
any
serious
importance
to
such
a
perishable
trifle
as
personal
appearance
,
I
might
be
inclined
to
add
that
hers
was
one
of
those
unfortunate
complexions
which
always
suffer
when
not
relieved
by
a
border
of
white
next
the
skin
.
<EOS>
But
what
are
our
complexions
and
our
looks
?
<EOS>
Hindrances
and
pitfalls
,
dear
girls
,
which
beset
us
on
our
way
to
higher
things
!
<EOS>
Greatly
to
my
surprise
,
Rachel
rose
when
I
entered
the
room
,
and
came
forward
to
meet
me
with
outstretched
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
to
see
you
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
Drusilla
,
I
have
been
in
the
habit
of
speaking
very
foolishly
and
very
rudely
to
you
,
on
former
occasions
.
<EOS>
I
beg
your
pardon
.
<EOS>
I
hope
you
will
forgive
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
My
face
,
I
suppose
,
betrayed
the
astonishment
I
felt
at
this
.
<EOS>
She
coloured
up
for
a
moment
,
and
then
proceeded
to
explain
herself
.
  
<EOS>
"
In
my
poor
mother
's
lifetime
,
"
she
went
on
,
"
<EOS>
her
friends
were
not
always
my
friends
,
too
.
<EOS>
Now
I
have
lost
her
,
my
heart
turns
for
comfort
to
the
people
she
liked
.
<EOS>
She
liked
you
.
<EOS>
Try
to
be
friends
with
me
,
Drusilla
,
if
you
can
.
"
  
<EOS>
To
any
rightly
-
constituted
mind
,
the
motive
thus
acknowledged
was
simply
shocking
.
<EOS>
Here
in
Christian
England
was
a
young
woman
in
a
state
of
bereavement
,
with
so
little
idea
of
where
to
look
for
true
comfort
,
that
she
actually
expected
to
find
it
among
her
mother
's
friends
!
<EOS>
Here
was
a
relative
of
mine
,
awakened
to
a
sense
of
her
shortcomings
towards
others
,
under
the
influence
,
not
of
conviction
and
duty
,
but
of
sentiment
and
impulse
!
<EOS>
Most
deplorable
to
think
of
 
<EOS>
but
,
still
,
suggestive
of
something
hopeful
,
to
a
person
of
my
experience
in
plying
the
good
work
.
<EOS>
There
could
be
no
harm
,
I
thought
,
in
ascertaining
the
extent
of
the
change
which
the
loss
of
her
mother
had
wrought
in
Rachel
's
character
.
<EOS>
I
decided
,
as
a
useful
test
,
to
probe
her
on
the
subject
of
her
marriage
-
engagement
to
Mr.
Godfrey
Ablewhite
.
  
<EOS>
Having
first
met
her
advances
with
all
possible
cordiality
,
I
sat
by
her
on
the
sofa
,
at
her
own
request
.
<EOS>
We
discussed
family
affairs
and
future
plans
 
always
excepting
that
one
future
plan
which
was
to
end
in
her
marriage
.
<EOS>
Try
as
I
might
to
turn
the
conversation
that
way
,
she
resolutely
declined
to
take
the
hint
.
<EOS>
Any
open
reference
to
the
question
,
on
my
part
,
would
have
been
premature
at
this
early
stage
of
our
reconciliation
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
I
had
discovered
all
I
wanted
to
know
.
<EOS>
She
was
no
longer
the
reckless
,
defiant
creature
whom
I
had
heard
and
seen
,
on
the
occasion
of
my
martyrdom
in
Montagu
Square
.
<EOS>
This
was
,
of
itself
,
enough
to
encourage
me
to
take
her
future
conversion
in
hand
 
beginning
with
a
few
words
of
earnest
warning
directed
against
the
hasty
formation
of
the
marriage
tie
,
and
so
getting
on
to
higher
things
.
<EOS>
Looking
at
her
,
now
,
with
this
new
interest
 
and
calling
to
mind
the
headlong
suddenness
with
which
she
had
met
Mr.
Godfrey
's
matrimonial
views
 
<EOS>
I
felt
the
solemn
duty
of
interfering
with
a
fervour
which
assured
me
that
I
should
achieve
no
common
results
.
<EOS>
Rapidity
of
proceeding
was
,
as
I
believed
,
of
importance
in
this
case
.
<EOS>
I
went
back
at
once
to
the
question
of
the
servants
wanted
for
the
furnished
house
.
  
<EOS>
"
Where
is
the
list
,
dear
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Rachel
produced
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Cook
,
kitchen
-
maid
,
housemaid
,
and
footman
,
"
I
read
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
Rachel
,
these
servants
are
only
wanted
for
a
term
 
<EOS>
the
term
during
which
your
guardian
has
taken
the
house
.
<EOS>
We
shall
have
great
difficulty
in
finding
persons
of
character
and
capacity
to
accept
a
temporary
engagement
of
that
sort
,
if
we
try
in
London
.
<EOS>
Has
the
house
in
Brighton
been
found
yet
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
Godfrey
has
taken
it
;
and
persons
in
the
house
wanted
him
to
hire
them
as
servants
.
<EOS>
He
thought
they
would
hardly
do
for
us
,
and
came
back
having
settled
nothing
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
have
no
experience
yourself
in
these
matters
,
Rachel
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
None
whatever
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
Aunt
Ablewhite
wo
n't
exert
herself
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
poor
dear
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
blame
her
,
Drusilla
.
<EOS>
I
think
she
is
the
only
really
happy
woman
I
have
ever
met
with
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
are
degrees
in
happiness
,
darling
.
<EOS>
We
must
have
a
little
talk
,
some
day
,
on
that
subject
.
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
I
will
undertake
to
meet
the
difficulty
about
the
servants
.
<EOS>
Your
aunt
will
write
a
letter
to
the
people
of
the
house
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
She
will
sign
a
letter
,
if
I
write
it
for
her
,
which
comes
to
the
same
thing
.
"
  
"
Quite
the
same
thing
.
<EOS>
I
shall
get
the
letter
,
and
I
will
go
to
Brighton
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
extremely
kind
of
you
!
<EOS>
We
will
join
you
as
soon
as
you
are
ready
for
us
.
<EOS>
And
you
will
stay
,
I
hope
,
as
my
guest
.
<EOS>
Brighton
is
so
lively
;
you
are
sure
to
enjoy
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
In
those
words
the
invitation
was
given
,
and
the
glorious
prospect
of
interference
was
opened
before
me
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
then
the
middle
of
the
week
.
<EOS>
By
Saturday
afternoon
the
house
was
ready
for
them
.
<EOS>
In
that
short
interval
I
had
sifted
,
not
the
characters
only
,
but
the
religious
views
as
well
,
of
all
the
disengaged
servants
who
applied
to
me
,
and
had
succeeded
in
making
a
selection
which
my
conscience
approved
.
<EOS>
I
also
discovered
,
and
called
on
two
serious
friends
of
mine
,
residents
in
the
town
,
to
whom
I
knew
I
could
confide
the
pious
object
which
had
brought
me
to
Brighton
.
<EOS>
One
of
them
 
a
clerical
friend
 
kindly
helped
me
to
take
sittings
for
our
little
party
in
the
church
in
which
he
himself
ministered
.
<EOS>
The
other
 
a
single
lady
,
like
myself
 
placed
the
resources
of
her
library
(
composed
throughout
of
precious
publications
)
entirely
at
my
disposal
.
<EOS>
I
borrowed
half
-
a
-
dozen
works
,
all
carefully
chosen
with
a
view
to
Rachel
.
<EOS>
When
these
had
been
judiciously
distributed
in
the
various
rooms
she
would
be
likely
to
occupy
,
I
considered
that
my
preparations
were
complete
.
<EOS>
Sound
doctrine
in
the
servants
who
waited
on
her
;
sound
doctrine
in
the
minister
who
preached
to
her
;
sound
doctrine
in
the
books
that
lay
on
her
table
 
<EOS>
such
was
the
treble
welcome
which
my
zeal
had
prepared
for
the
motherless
girl
!
<EOS>
A
heavenly
composure
filled
my
mind
,
on
that
Saturday
afternoon
,
as
I
sat
at
the
window
waiting
the
arrival
of
my
relatives
.
<EOS>
The
giddy
throng
passed
and
repassed
before
my
eyes
.
<EOS>
Alas
!
<EOS>
how
many
of
them
felt
my
exquisite
sense
of
duty
done
?
<EOS>
An
awful
question
.
<EOS>
Let
us
not
pursue
it
.
  
<EOS>
Between
six
and
seven
the
travellers
arrived
.
<EOS>
To
my
indescribable
surprise
,
they
were
escorted
,
not
by
Mr.
Godfrey
(
as
I
had
anticipated
)
,
but
by
the
lawyer
,
Mr.
Bruff
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
do
,
Miss
Clack
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
mean
to
stay
this
time
.
"
  
<EOS>
That
reference
to
the
occasion
on
which
I
had
obliged
him
to
postpone
his
business
to
mine
,
when
we
were
both
visiting
in
Montagu
Square
,
satisfied
me
that
the
old
worldling
had
come
to
Brighton
with
some
object
of
his
own
in
view
.
<EOS>
I
had
prepared
quite
a
little
Paradise
for
my
beloved
Rachel
 
and
here
was
the
Serpent
already
!
  
<EOS>
"
Godfrey
was
very
much
vexed
,
Drusilla
,
not
to
be
able
to
come
with
us
,
"
said
my
Aunt
Ablewhite
.
<EOS>
"
There
was
something
in
the
way
which
kept
him
in
town
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bruff
volunteered
to
take
his
place
,
and
make
a
holiday
of
it
till
Monday
morning
.
<EOS>
By
-
the
-
by
,
Mr.
Bruff
,
I
'm
ordered
to
take
exercise
,
and
I
do
n't
like
it
.
<EOS>
That
,
"
added
Aunt
Ablewhite
,
pointing
out
of
window
to
an
invalid
going
by
in
a
chair
on
wheels
,
drawn
by
a
man
,
"
is
my
idea
of
exercise
.
<EOS>
If
it
's
air
<EOS>
you
want
,
you
get
it
in
your
chair
.
<EOS>
And
if
it
's
fatigue
you
want
,
I
am
sure
it
's
fatigue
enough
to
look
at
the
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Rachel
stood
silent
,
at
a
window
by
herself
,
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
sea
.
  
<EOS>
"
Tired
,
love
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquired
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
.
<EOS>
Only
a
little
out
of
spirits
,
"
she
answered
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
often
seen
the
sea
,
on
our
Yorkshire
coast
,
with
that
light
on
it
.
<EOS>
And
I
was
thinking
,
Drusilla
,
of
the
days
that
can
never
come
again
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Bruff
remained
to
dinner
,
and
stayed
through
the
evening
.
<EOS>
The
more
I
saw
of
him
,
the
more
certain
I
felt
that
he
had
some
private
end
to
serve
in
coming
to
Brighton
.
<EOS>
I
watched
him
carefully
.
<EOS>
He
maintained
the
same
appearance
of
ease
,
and
talked
the
same
godless
gossip
,
hour
after
hour
,
until
it
was
time
to
take
leave
.
<EOS>
As
he
shook
hands
with
Rachel
,
I
caught
his
hard
and
cunning
eyes
resting
on
her
for
a
moment
with
a
peculiar
interest
and
attention
.
<EOS>
She
was
plainly
concerned
in
the
object
that
he
had
in
view
.
<EOS>
He
said
nothing
out
of
the
common
to
her
or
to
anyone
on
leaving
.
<EOS>
He
invited
himself
to
luncheon
the
next
day
,
and
then
he
went
away
to
his
hotel
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
impossible
the
next
morning
to
get
my
Aunt
Ablewhite
out
of
her
dressing
-
gown
in
time
for
church
.
<EOS>
Her
invalid
daughter
(
suffering
from
nothing
,
in
my
opinion
,
but
incurable
laziness
,
inherited
from
her
mother
)
announced
that
she
meant
to
remain
in
bed
for
the
day
.
<EOS>
Rachel
and
I
went
alone
together
to
church
.
<EOS>
A
magnificent
sermon
was
preached
by
my
gifted
friend
on
the
heathen
indifference
of
the
world
to
the
sinfulness
of
little
sins
.
<EOS>
For
more
than
an
hour
his
eloquence
(
assisted
by
his
glorious
voice
)
thundered
through
the
sacred
edifice
.
<EOS>
I
said
to
Rachel
,
when
we
came
out
,
"
Has
it
found
its
way
to
your
heart
,
dear
?
"
<EOS>
And
she
answered
,
"
No
;
it
has
only
made
my
head
ache
.
<EOS>
"
This
might
have
been
discouraging
to
some
people
;
but
,
once
embarked
on
a
career
of
manifest
usefulness
,
nothing
discourages
Me
.
  
<EOS>
We
found
Aunt
Ablewhite
and
Mr.
Bruff
at
luncheon
.
<EOS>
When
Rachel
declined
eating
anything
,
and
gave
as
a
reason
for
it
that
she
was
suffering
from
a
headache
,
the
lawyer
's
cunning
instantly
saw
,
and
seized
,
the
chance
that
she
had
given
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
only
one
remedy
for
a
headache
,
"
said
this
horrible
old
man
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
walk
,
Miss
Rachel
,
is
the
thing
to
cure
you
.
<EOS>
I
am
entirely
at
your
service
,
if
you
will
honour
me
by
accepting
my
arm
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
With
the
greatest
pleasure
.
<EOS>
A
walk
is
the
very
thing
I
was
longing
for
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
past
two
,
"
I
gently
suggested
.
"
<EOS>
And
the
afternoon
service
,
Rachel
,
begins
at
three
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
can
you
expect
me
to
go
to
church
again
,
"
she
asked
,
petulantly
,
"
with
such
a
headache
as
mine
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Bruff
officiously
opened
the
door
for
her
.
<EOS>
In
another
minute
more
they
were
both
out
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
when
I
have
felt
the
solemn
duty
of
interfering
so
strongly
as
I
felt
it
at
that
moment
.
<EOS>
But
what
was
to
be
done
?
<EOS>
Nothing
was
to
be
done
but
to
interfere
at
the
first
opportunity
,
later
in
the
day
.
  
<EOS>
On
my
return
from
the
afternoon
service
I
found
that
they
had
just
got
back
.
<EOS>
One
look
at
them
told
me
that
the
lawyer
had
said
what
he
wanted
to
say
.
<EOS>
I
had
never
before
seen
Rachel
so
silent
and
so
thoughtful
.
<EOS>
I
had
never
before
seen
Mr.
Bruff
pay
her
such
devoted
attention
,
and
look
at
her
with
such
marked
respect
.
<EOS>
He
had
(
or
pretended
that
he
had
)
an
engagement
to
dinner
that
day
 
<EOS>
and
he
took
an
early
leave
of
us
all
;
intending
to
go
back
to
London
by
the
first
train
the
next
morning
.
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
sure
of
your
own
resolution
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
to
Rachel
at
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
Quite
sure
,
"
she
answered
 
and
so
they
parted
.
  
<EOS>
The
moment
his
back
was
turned
,
Rachel
withdrew
to
her
own
room
.
<EOS>
She
never
appeared
at
dinner
.
<EOS>
Her
maid
(
the
person
with
the
cap
-
ribbons
)
was
sent
down
-
stairs
to
announce
that
her
headache
had
returned
.
<EOS>
I
ran
up
to
her
and
made
all
sorts
of
sisterly
offers
through
the
door
.
<EOS>
It
was
locked
,
and
she
kept
it
locked
.
<EOS>
Plenty
of
obstructive
material
to
work
on
here
!
<EOS>
I
felt
greatly
cheered
and
stimulated
by
her
locking
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
When
her
cup
of
tea
went
up
to
her
the
next
morning
,
I
followed
it
in
.
<EOS>
I
sat
by
her
bedside
and
said
a
few
earnest
words
.
<EOS>
She
listened
with
languid
civility
.
<EOS>
I
noticed
my
serious
friend
's
precious
publications
huddled
together
on
a
table
in
a
corner
.
<EOS>
Had
she
chanced
to
look
into
them
?
 
<EOS>
I
asked
.
<EOS>
Yes
 
<EOS>
and
they
had
not
interested
her
.
<EOS>
Would
she
allow
me
to
read
a
few
passages
of
the
deepest
interest
,
which
had
probably
escaped
her
eye
?
<EOS>
No
,
not
now
 
she
had
other
things
to
think
of
.
<EOS>
She
gave
these
answers
,
with
her
attention
apparently
absorbed
in
folding
and
refolding
the
frilling
on
her
nightgown
.
<EOS>
It
was
plainly
necessary
to
rouse
her
by
some
reference
to
those
worldly
interests
which
she
still
had
at
heart
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
know
,
love
<EOS>
,
"
I
said
,
"
I
had
an
odd
fancy
,
yesterday
,
about
Mr.
Bruff
?
<EOS>
I
thought
,
when
I
saw
you
after
your
walk
with
him
,
that
he
had
been
telling
you
some
bad
news
.
"
  
<EOS>
Her
fingers
dropped
from
the
frilling
of
her
nightgown
,
and
her
fierce
black
eyes
flashed
at
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
Quite
the
contrary
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
news
<EOS>
I
was
interested
in
hearing
 
<EOS>
and
I
am
deeply
indebted
to
Mr.
Bruff
for
telling
me
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
?
<EOS>
"
I
said
,
in
a
tone
of
gentle
interest
.
  
<EOS>
Her
fingers
went
back
to
the
frilling
,
and
she
turned
her
head
sullenly
away
from
me
.
<EOS>
I
had
been
met
in
this
manner
,
in
the
course
of
plying
the
good
work
,
hundreds
of
times
.
<EOS>
She
merely
stimulated
me
to
try
again
.
<EOS>
In
my
dauntless
zeal
for
her
welfare
,
I
ran
the
great
risk
,
and
openly
alluded
to
her
marriage
engagement
.
  
<EOS>
"
News
you
were
interested
in
hearing
?
<EOS>
"
I
repeated
.
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
,
my
dear
Rachel
,
that
must
be
news
of
Mr.
Godfrey
Ablewhite
?
"
  
She
started
up
in
the
bed
,
and
turned
deadly
pale
.
<EOS>
It
was
evidently
on
the
tip
of
her
tongue
to
retort
on
me
with
the
unbridled
insolence
of
former
times
.
<EOS>
She
checked
herself
 
laid
her
head
back
on
the
pillow
 
<EOS>
considered
a
minute
 
and
then
answered
in
these
remarkable
words
:
  
<EOS>
"
I
SHALL
NEVER
MARRY
MR
.
<EOS>
GODFREY
ABLEWHITE
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
my
turn
to
start
at
that
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
can
you
possibly
mean
?
<EOS>
"
I
exclaimed
.
<EOS>
"
The
marriage
is
considered
by
the
whole
family
as
a
settled
thing
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Godfrey
Ablewhite
is
expected
here
to
-
day
,
"
she
said
doggedly
.
"
<EOS>
Wait
till
he
comes
 
and
you
will
see
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
my
dear
Rachel
 
"
  
She
rang
the
bell
at
the
head
of
her
bed
.
<EOS>
The
person
with
the
cap
-
ribbons
appeared
.
  
<EOS>
"
Penelope
!
<EOS>
my
bath
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Let
me
give
her
her
due
.
<EOS>
In
the
state
of
my
feelings
at
that
moment
,
I
do
sincerely
believe
that
she
had
hit
on
the
only
possible
way
of
forcing
me
to
leave
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
By
the
mere
worldly
mind
my
position
towards
Rachel
might
have
been
viewed
as
presenting
difficulties
of
no
ordinary
kind
.
<EOS>
I
had
reckoned
on
leading
her
to
higher
things
by
means
of
a
little
earnest
exhortation
on
the
subject
of
her
marriage
.
<EOS>
And
now
,
if
she
was
to
be
believed
,
no
such
event
as
her
marriage
was
to
take
place
at
all
.
<EOS>
But
ah
,
my
friends
!
<EOS>
a
working
Christian
of
my
experience
(
with
an
evangelising
prospect
before
her
)
takes
broader
views
than
these
.
<EOS>
Supposing
Rachel
really
broke
off
the
marriage
,
on
which
the
Ablewhites
,
father
and
son
,
counted
as
a
settled
thing
,
what
would
be
the
result
?
<EOS>
It
could
only
end
,
if
she
held
firm
,
in
an
exchanging
of
hard
words
and
bitter
accusations
on
both
sides
.
<EOS>
And
what
would
be
the
effect
on
Rachel
when
the
stormy
interview
was
over
?
<EOS>
A
salutary
moral
depression
would
be
the
effect
.
<EOS>
Her
pride
would
be
exhausted
,
her
stubbornness
would
be
exhausted
,
by
the
resolute
resistance
which
it
was
in
her
character
to
make
under
the
circumstances
.
<EOS>
She
would
turn
for
sympathy
to
the
nearest
person
who
had
sympathy
to
offer
.
<EOS>
And
I
was
that
nearest
person
 
brimful
of
comfort
,
charged
to
overflowing
with
seasonable
and
reviving
words
.
<EOS>
Never
had
the
evangelising
prospect
looked
brighter
,
to
my
eyes
,
than
it
looked
now
.
  
<EOS>
She
came
down
to
breakfast
,
but
she
ate
nothing
,
and
hardly
uttered
a
word
.
  
<EOS>
After
breakfast
she
wandered
listlessly
from
room
to
room
 
then
suddenly
roused
herself
,
and
opened
the
piano
.
<EOS>
The
music
she
selected
to
play
was
of
the
most
scandalously
profane
sort
,
associated
with
performances
on
the
stage
which
it
curdles
one
's
blood
to
think
of
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
been
premature
to
interfere
with
her
at
such
a
time
as
this
.
<EOS>
I
privately
ascertained
the
hour
at
which
Mr.
Godfrey
Ablewhite
was
expected
,
and
then
I
escaped
the
music
by
leaving
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
Being
out
alone
,
I
took
the
opportunity
of
calling
upon
my
two
resident
friends
.
<EOS>
It
was
an
indescribable
luxury
to
find
myself
indulging
in
earnest
conversation
with
serious
persons
.
<EOS>
Infinitely
encouraged
and
refreshed
<EOS>
,
I
turned
my
steps
back
again
to
the
house
,
in
excellent
time
to
await
the
arrival
of
our
expected
visitor
.
<EOS>
I
entered
the
dining
-
room
,
always
empty
at
that
hour
of
the
day
,
and
found
myself
face
to
face
with
Mr.
Godfrey
Ablewhite
!
  
<EOS>
He
made
no
attempt
to
fly
the
place
.
<EOS>
Quite
the
contrary
.
<EOS>
He
advanced
to
meet
me
with
the
utmost
eagerness
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
Miss
Clack
,
I
have
been
only
waiting
to
see
you
!
<EOS>
Chance
set
me
free
of
my
London
engagements
to
-
day
sooner
than
I
had
expected
,
and
I
have
got
here
,
in
consequence
,
earlier
than
my
appointed
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Not
the
slightest
embarrassment
encumbered
his
explanation
,
though
this
was
his
first
meeting
with
me
after
the
scene
in
Montagu
Square
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
aware
,
it
is
true
,
of
my
having
been
a
witness
of
that
scene
.
<EOS>
But
he
knew
,
on
the
other
hand
,
that
my
attendances
at
the
Mothers
'
Small
-
Clothes
,
and
my
relations
with
friends
attached
to
other
charities
,
must
have
informed
me
of
his
shameless
neglect
of
his
Ladies
and
of
his
Poor
.
<EOS>
And
yet
there
he
was
before
me
,
in
full
possession
of
his
charming
voice
and
his
irresistible
smile
!
  
<EOS>
"
Have
you
seen
Rachel
yet
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
  
<EOS>
He
sighed
gently
,
and
took
me
by
the
hand
.
<EOS>
I
should
certainly
have
snatched
my
hand
away
,
if
the
manner
in
which
he
gave
his
answer
had
not
paralysed
me
with
astonishment
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
seen
Rachel
,
"
he
said
with
perfect
tranquillity
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
aware
,
dear
friend
,
that
she
was
engaged
to
me
?
<EOS>
Well
,
she
has
taken
a
sudden
resolution
to
break
the
engagement
.
<EOS>
Reflection
has
convinced
her
that
she
will
best
consult
her
welfare
and
mine
by
retracting
a
rash
promise
,
and
leaving
me
free
to
make
some
happier
choice
elsewhere
.
<EOS>
That
is
the
only
reason
she
will
give
,
and
the
only
answer
she
will
make
to
every
question
that
I
can
ask
of
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
have
you
done
on
your
side
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquired
.
<EOS>
"
Have
you
submitted
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
he
said
with
the
most
unruffled
composure
,
"
I
have
submitted
.
"
  
<EOS>
His
conduct
,
under
the
circumstances
,
was
so
utterly
inconceivable
,
that
I
stood
bewildered
with
my
hand
in
his
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
piece
of
rudeness
to
stare
at
anybody
,
and
it
is
an
act
of
indelicacy
to
stare
at
a
gentleman
.
<EOS>
I
committed
both
those
improprieties
.
<EOS>
And
I
said
,
as
if
in
a
dream
,
"
What
does
it
mean
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Permit
me
to
tell
you
,
"
he
replied
.
"
<EOS>
And
suppose
we
sit
down
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
led
me
to
a
chair
.
<EOS>
I
have
an
indistinct
remembrance
that
he
was
very
affectionate
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
think
he
put
his
arm
<EOS>
round
my
waist
to
support
me
 
<EOS>
but
I
am
not
sure
.
<EOS>
I
was
quite
helpless
,
and
his
ways
with
ladies
were
very
endearing
.
<EOS>
At
any
rate
,
we
sat
down
.
<EOS>
I
can
answer
for
that
,
if
I
can
answer
for
nothing
more
.
    
<EOS>
"
I
have
lost
a
beautiful
girl
,
an
excellent
social
position
,
and
a
handsome
income
,
"
Mr.
Godfrey
began
;
"
and
I
have
submitted
to
it
without
a
struggle
.
<EOS>
What
can
be
the
motive
for
such
extraordinary
conduct
as
that
?
<EOS>
My
precious
friend
,
there
is
no
motive
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
motive
?
<EOS>
"
I
repeated
.
  
<EOS>
"
Let
me
appeal
,
my
dear
Miss
Clack
,
to
your
experience
of
children
,
"
he
went
on
.
"
<EOS>
A
child
pursues
a
certain
course
of
conduct
.
<EOS>
You
are
greatly
struck
by
it
,
and
you
attempt
to
get
at
the
motive
.
<EOS>
The
dear
little
thing
is
incapable
of
telling
you
its
motive
.
<EOS>
You
might
as
well
ask
the
grass
why
it
grows
,
or
the
birds
why
they
sing
.
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
in
this
matter
,
I
am
like
the
dear
little
thing
 
like
the
grass
 
like
the
birds
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
why
I
made
a
proposal
of
marriage
to
Miss
Verinder
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
why
I
have
shamefully
neglected
my
dear
Ladies
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
why
I
have
apostatised
from
the
Mothers
'
Small
-
Clothes
.
<EOS>
You
say
to
the
child
,
Why
have
you
been
naughty
?
<EOS>
And
the
little
angel
puts
its
finger
into
its
mouth
,
and
does
n't
know
.
<EOS>
My
case
exactly
,
Miss
Clack
!
<EOS>
I
could
n't
confess
it
to
anybody
else
.
<EOS>
I
feel
impelled
to
confess
it
to
YOU
!
"
  
<EOS>
I
began
to
recover
myself
.
<EOS>
A
mental
problem
was
involved
here
.
<EOS>
I
am
deeply
interested
in
mental
problems
 
<EOS>
and
I
am
not
,
it
is
thought
,
without
some
skill
in
solving
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
Best
of
friends
,
exert
your
intellect
,
and
help
me
,
"
he
proceeded
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Tell
me
 
why
does
a
time
come
when
these
matrimonial
proceedings
of
mine
begin
to
look
like
something
done
in
a
dream
?
<EOS>
Why
does
it
suddenly
occur
to
me
that
my
true
happiness
is
in
helping
my
dear
Ladies
,
in
going
my
modest
round
of
useful
work
,
in
saying
my
few
earnest
words
when
called
on
by
my
Chairman
?
<EOS>
What
do
I
want
with
a
position
?
<EOS>
I
have
got
a
position
!
<EOS>
What
do
I
want
with
an
income
?
<EOS>
I
can
pay
for
my
bread
and
cheese
,
and
my
nice
little
lodging
,
and
my
two
coats
a
year
.
<EOS>
What
do
I
want
with
Miss
Verinder
?
<EOS>
She
has
told
me
with
her
own
lips
(
this
,
dear
lady
,
is
between
ourselves
)
<EOS>
that
she
loves
another
man
,
and
that
her
only
idea
in
marrying
me
is
to
try
and
put
that
other
man
out
of
her
head
.
<EOS>
What
a
horrid
union
is
this
!
<EOS>
Oh
,
dear
me
,
what
a
horrid
union
is
this
!
<EOS>
Such
are
my
reflections
,
Miss
Clack
,
on
my
way
to
Brighton
.
<EOS>
I
approach
Rachel
with
the
feeling
of
a
criminal
who
is
going
to
receive
his
sentence
.
<EOS>
When
I
find
that
she
has
changed
her
mind
too
 
when
I
hear
her
propose
to
break
the
engagement
 
<EOS>
I
experience
<EOS>
(
there
is
no
sort
of
doubt
about
it
)
<EOS>
a
most
overpowering
sense
of
relief
.
<EOS>
A
month
ago
I
was
pressing
her
rapturously
to
my
bosom
.
<EOS>
An
hour
ago
,
the
happiness
of
knowing
that
I
shall
never
press
her
again
,
intoxicates
me
like
strong
liquor
.
<EOS>
The
thing
seems
impossible
 
the
thing
ca
n't
be
.
<EOS>
And
yet
there
are
the
facts
,
as
I
had
the
honour
of
stating
them
when
we
first
sat
down
together
in
these
two
chairs
.
<EOS>
I
have
lost
a
beautiful
girl
,
an
excellent
social
position
,
and
a
handsome
income
;
and
I
have
submitted
to
it
without
a
struggle
.
<EOS>
Can
you
account
for
it
,
dear
friend
?
<EOS>
It
's
quite
beyond
ME
.
"
  
<EOS>
His
magnificent
head
sank
on
his
breast
,
and
he
gave
up
his
own
mental
problem
in
despair
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
deeply
touched
.
<EOS>
The
case
(
if
I
may
speak
as
a
spiritual
physician
)
was
now
quite
plain
to
me
.
<EOS>
It
is
no
uncommon
event
,
in
the
experience
of
us
all
,
to
see
the
possessors
of
exalted
ability
occasionally
humbled
to
the
level
of
the
most
poorly
-
gifted
people
about
them
.
<EOS>
The
object
,
no
doubt
,
in
the
wise
economy
of
Providence
,
is
to
remind
greatness
that
it
is
mortal
and
that
the
power
which
has
conferred
it
can
also
take
it
away
.
<EOS>
It
was
now
 
to
my
mind
 
easy
to
discern
one
of
these
salutary
humiliations
in
the
deplorable
proceedings
on
dear
Mr.
Godfrey
's
part
,
of
which
I
had
been
the
unseen
witness
.
<EOS>
And
it
was
equally
easy
to
recognise
the
welcome
reappearance
of
his
own
finer
nature
in
the
horror
with
which
he
recoiled
from
the
idea
of
a
marriage
with
Rachel
,
and
in
the
charming
eagerness
which
he
showed
to
return
to
his
Ladies
and
his
Poor
.
  
<EOS>
I
put
this
view
before
him
in
a
few
simple
and
sisterly
words
.
<EOS>
His
joy
was
beautiful
to
see
.
<EOS>
He
compared
himself
,
as
I
went
on
,
to
a
lost
man
emerging
from
the
darkness
into
the
light
.
<EOS>
When
I
answered
for
a
loving
reception
of
him
at
the
Mothers
'
Small
-
Clothes
,
the
grateful
heart
of
our
Christian
Hero
overflowed
.
<EOS>
He
pressed
my
hands
alternately
to
his
lips
.
<EOS>
Overwhelmed
by
the
exquisite
triumph
of
having
got
him
back
among
us
,
I
let
him
do
what
he
liked
with
my
hands
.
<EOS>
I
closed
my
eyes
.
<EOS>
I
felt
my
head
,
in
an
ecstasy
of
spiritual
self
-
forgetfulness
,
sinking
on
his
shoulder
.
<EOS>
In
a
moment
more
I
should
certainly
have
swooned
away
in
his
arms
,
but
for
an
interruption
from
the
outer
world
,
which
brought
me
to
myself
again
.
<EOS>
A
horrid
rattling
of
knives
and
forks
sounded
outside
the
door
,
and
the
footman
came
in
to
lay
the
table
for
luncheon
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Godfrey
started
up
,
and
looked
at
the
clock
on
the
mantelpiece
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
time
flies
with
YOU
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
barely
catch
the
train
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
ventured
on
asking
why
he
was
in
such
a
hurry
to
get
back
to
town
.
<EOS>
His
answer
reminded
me
of
family
difficulties
that
were
still
to
be
reconciled
,
and
of
family
disagreements
that
were
yet
to
come
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
heard
from
my
father
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
Business
obliges
him
to
leave
Frizinghall
for
London
to
-
day
,
and
he
proposes
coming
on
here
,
either
this
evening
or
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
I
must
tell
him
what
has
happened
between
Rachel
and
me
.
<EOS>
His
heart
is
set
on
our
marriage
 
there
will
be
great
difficulty
,
I
fear
,
in
reconciling
him
to
the
breaking
-
off
of
the
engagement
.
<EOS>
I
must
stop
him
,
for
all
our
sakes
,
from
coming
here
till
he
IS
reconciled
.
<EOS>
Best
and
dearest
of
friends
,
we
shall
meet
again
!
"
  
<EOS>
With
those
words
he
hurried
out
.
<EOS>
In
equal
haste
on
my
side
,
I
ran
upstairs
to
compose
myself
in
my
own
room
before
meeting
Aunt
Ablewhite
and
Rachel
at
the
luncheon
-
table
.
  
<EOS>
I
am
well
aware
 
to
dwell
for
a
moment
yet
on
the
subject
of
Mr.
Godfrey
 
that
the
all
-
profaning
opinion
of
the
world
has
charged
him
with
having
his
own
private
reasons
for
releasing
Rachel
from
her
engagement
,
at
the
first
opportunity
she
gave
him
.
<EOS>
It
has
also
reached
my
ears
,
that
his
anxiety
to
recover
his
place
in
my
estimation
has
been
attributed
in
certain
quarters
,
to
a
mercenary
eagerness
to
make
his
peace
(
through
me
)
with
a
venerable
committee
-
woman
at
the
Mothers
'
Small
-
Clothes
,
abundantly
blessed
with
the
goods
of
this
world
,
and
a
beloved
and
intimate
friend
of
my
own
.
<EOS>
I
only
notice
these
odious
slanders
for
the
sake
of
declaring
that
they
never
had
a
moment
's
influence
on
my
mind
.
<EOS>
In
obedience
to
my
instructions
,
I
have
exhibited
the
fluctuations
in
my
opinion
of
our
Christian
Hero
,
exactly
as
I
find
them
recorded
in
my
diary
.
<EOS>
In
justice
to
myself
,
let
me
here
add
that
,
once
reinstated
in
his
place
in
my
estimation
,
my
gifted
friend
never
lost
that
place
again
.
<EOS>
I
write
with
the
tears
in
my
eyes
,
burning
to
say
more
.
<EOS>
But
no
 
I
am
cruelly
limited
to
my
actual
experience
of
persons
and
things
.
<EOS>
In
less
than
a
month
from
the
time
of
which
I
am
now
writing
,
events
in
the
money
-
market
(
which
diminished
even
my
miserable
little
income
)
forced
me
into
foreign
exile
,
and
left
me
with
nothing
but
a
loving
remembrance
of
Mr.
Godfrey
which
the
slander
of
the
world
has
assailed
,
and
assailed
in
vain
.
  
<EOS>
Let
me
dry
my
eyes
,
and
return
to
my
narrative
.
  
<EOS>
I
went
downstairs
to
luncheon
,
naturally
anxious
to
see
how
Rachel
was
affected
by
her
release
from
her
marriage
engagement
.
  
<EOS>
It
appeared
to
me
 
<EOS>
but
I
own
I
am
a
poor
authority
in
such
matters
 
that
the
recovery
of
her
freedom
had
set
her
thinking
again
of
that
other
man
whom
she
loved
,
and
that
she
was
furious
with
herself
for
not
being
able
to
control
a
revulsion
of
feeling
of
which
she
was
secretly
ashamed
.
<EOS>
Who
was
the
man
?
<EOS>
I
had
my
suspicions
 
<EOS>
but
it
was
needless
to
waste
time
in
idle
speculation
.
<EOS>
When
I
had
converted
her
,
she
would
,
as
a
matter
of
course
,
have
no
concealments
from
Me
.
<EOS>
I
should
hear
all
about
the
man
;
I
should
hear
all
about
the
Moonstone
.
<EOS>
If
I
had
had
no
higher
object
in
stirring
her
up
to
a
sense
of
spiritual
things
,
the
motive
of
relieving
her
mind
of
its
guilty
secrets
would
have
been
enough
of
itself
to
encourage
me
to
go
on
.
  
<EOS>
Aunt
Ablewhite
took
her
exercise
in
the
afternoon
in
an
invalid
chair
.
<EOS>
Rachel
accompanied
her
.
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
could
drag
the
chair
,
"
she
broke
out
,
recklessly
.
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
could
fatigue
myself
till
I
was
ready
to
drop
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
was
in
the
same
humour
in
the
evening
.
<EOS>
I
discovered
in
one
of
my
friend
's
precious
publications
 
<EOS>
the
Life
,
Letters
,
and
Labours
of
Miss
Jane
Ann
Stamper
,
forty
-
fourth
edition
 
<EOS>
passages
which
bore
with
a
marvellous
appropriateness
on
Rachel
's
present
position
.
<EOS>
Upon
my
proposing
to
read
them
,
she
went
to
the
piano
.
<EOS>
Conceive
how
little
she
must
have
known
of
serious
people
,
if
she
supposed
that
my
patience
was
to
be
exhausted
in
that
way
!
<EOS>
I
kept
Miss
Jane
Ann
Stamper
by
me
,
and
waited
for
events
with
the
most
unfaltering
trust
in
the
future
.
  
<EOS>
Old
Mr.
Ablewhite
never
made
his
appearance
that
night
.
<EOS>
But
I
knew
the
importance
which
his
worldly
greed
attached
to
his
son
's
marriage
with
Miss
Verinder
 
<EOS>
and
I
felt
a
positive
conviction
<EOS>
(
do
what
Mr.
Godfrey
might
to
prevent
it
)
that
we
should
see
him
the
next
day
.
<EOS>
With
his
interference
in
the
matter
,
the
storm
on
which
I
had
counted
would
certainly
come
,
and
the
salutary
exhaustion
of
Rachel
's
resisting
powers
would
as
certainly
follow
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
ignorant
that
old
Mr.
Ablewhite
has
the
reputation
generally
(
especially
among
his
inferiors
)
of
being
a
remarkably
good
-
natured
man
.
<EOS>
According
to
my
observation
of
him
,
he
deserves
his
reputation
as
long
as
he
has
his
own
way
,
and
not
a
moment
longer
.
  
<EOS>
The
next
day
,
exactly
as
I
had
foreseen
,
Aunt
Ablewhite
was
as
near
to
being
astonished
as
her
nature
would
permit
,
by
the
sudden
appearance
of
her
husband
.
<EOS>
He
had
barely
been
a
minute
in
the
house
,
before
he
was
followed
,
to
MY
astonishment
this
time
,
by
an
unexpected
complication
in
the
shape
of
Mr.
Bruff
.
  
<EOS>
I
never
remember
feeling
the
presence
of
the
lawyer
to
be
more
unwelcome
than
I
felt
it
at
that
moment
.
<EOS>
He
looked
ready
for
anything
in
the
way
of
an
obstructive
proceeding
 
capable
even
of
keeping
the
peace
with
Rachel
for
one
of
the
combatants
!
  
<EOS>
"
This
is
a
pleasant
surprise
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr.
Ablewhite
,
addressing
himself
with
his
deceptive
cordiality
to
Mr.
Bruff
.
<EOS>
"
When
I
left
your
office
yesterday
,
I
did
n't
expect
to
have
the
honour
of
seeing
you
at
Brighton
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
turned
over
our
conversation
in
my
mind
,
after
you
had
gone
,
"
replied
Mr.
Bruff
.
"
<EOS>
And
it
occurred
to
me
that
I
might
perhaps
be
of
some
use
on
this
occasion
.
<EOS>
I
was
just
in
time
to
catch
the
train
,
and
I
had
no
opportunity
of
discovering
the
carriage
in
which
you
were
travelling
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Having
given
that
explanation
,
he
seated
himself
by
Rachel
.
<EOS>
I
retired
modestly
to
a
corner
 
with
Miss
Jane
Ann
Stamper
on
my
lap
,
in
case
of
emergency
.
<EOS>
My
aunt
sat
at
the
window
;
placidly
fanning
herself
as
usual
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Ablewhite
stood
up
in
the
middle
of
the
room
,
with
his
bald
head
much
pinker
than
I
had
ever
seen
it
yet
,
and
addressed
himself
in
the
most
affectionate
manner
to
his
niece
.
  
<EOS>
"
Rachel
,
my
dear
,
"
he
said
,
"
I
have
heard
some
very
extraordinary
news
from
Godfrey
.
<EOS>
And
I
am
here
to
inquire
about
it
.
<EOS>
You
have
a
sitting
-
room
of
your
own
in
this
house
.
<EOS>
Will
you
honour
me
by
showing
me
the
way
to
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
Rachel
never
moved
.
<EOS>
Whether
she
was
determined
to
bring
matters
to
a
crisis
,
or
whether
she
was
prompted
by
some
private
sign
from
Mr.
Bruff
,
is
more
than
I
can
tell
.
<EOS>
She
declined
doing
old
Mr.
Ablewhite
the
honour
of
conducting
him
into
her
sitting
-
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
Whatever
you
wish
to
say
to
me
,
"
she
answered
,
"
can
be
said
here
 
in
the
presence
of
my
relatives
,
and
in
the
presence
"
(
she
looked
at
Mr.
Bruff
)
"
of
my
mother
's
trusted
old
friend
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Just
as
you
please
,
my
dear
,
"
said
the
amiable
Mr.
Ablewhite
.
<EOS>
He
took
a
chair
.
<EOS>
The
rest
of
them
looked
at
his
face
 
as
if
they
expected
it
,
after
seventy
years
of
worldly
training
,
to
speak
the
truth
.
<EOS>
I
looked
at
the
top
of
his
bald
head
;
having
noticed
on
other
occasions
that
the
temper
which
was
really
in
him
had
a
habit
of
registering
itself
THERE
.
  
<EOS>
"
Some
weeks
ago
,
"
pursued
the
old
gentleman
,
"
my
son
informed
me
that
Miss
Verinder
had
done
him
the
honour
to
engage
herself
to
marry
him
.
<EOS>
Is
it
possible
,
Rachel
,
that
he
can
have
misinterpreted
 
or
presumed
upon
 
what
you
really
said
to
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Certainly
not
,
"
she
replied
.
<EOS>
"
I
did
engage
myself
to
marry
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
frankly
answered
!
"
said
Mr.
Ablewhite
.
"
<EOS>
And
most
satisfactory
,
my
dear
,
so
far
.
<EOS>
In
respect
to
what
happened
some
weeks
since
,
Godfrey
has
made
no
mistake
.
<EOS>
The
error
is
evidently
in
what
he
told
me
yesterday
.
<EOS>
I
begin
to
see
it
now
.
<EOS>
You
and
he
have
had
a
lovers
'
quarrel
 
and
my
foolish
son
has
interpreted
it
seriously
.
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
I
should
have
known
better
than
that
at
his
age
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
fallen
nature
in
Rachel
 
<EOS>
the
mother
Eve
,
so
to
speak
 
began
to
chafe
at
this
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pray
let
us
understand
each
other
,
Mr.
Ablewhite
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
Nothing
in
the
least
like
a
quarrel
took
place
yesterday
between
your
son
and
me
.
<EOS>
If
he
told
you
that
I
proposed
breaking
off
our
marriage
engagement
,
and
that
he
agreed
on
his
side
 
<EOS>
he
told
you
the
truth
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
self
-
registering
thermometer
at
the
top
of
Mr.
Ablewhite
's
bald
head
began
to
indicate
a
rise
of
temper
.
<EOS>
His
face
was
more
amiable
than
ever
 
<EOS>
but
THERE
was
the
pink
at
the
top
of
his
face
,
a
shade
deeper
already
!
  
<EOS>
"
Come
,
come
,
my
dear
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
in
his
most
soothing
manner
,
"
now
do
n't
be
angry
,
and
do
n't
be
hard
on
poor
Godfrey
!
<EOS>
He
has
evidently
said
some
unfortunate
thing
.
<EOS>
He
was
always
clumsy
from
a
child
 
<EOS>
but
he
means
well
,
Rachel
,
he
means
well
!
"
  
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Ablewhite
,
I
have
either
expressed
myself
very
badly
,
or
you
are
purposely
mistaking
me
.
<EOS>
Once
for
all
,
it
is
a
settled
thing
between
your
son
and
myself
that
we
remain
,
for
the
rest
of
our
lives
,
cousins
and
nothing
more
.
<EOS>
Is
that
plain
enough
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
tone
in
which
she
said
those
words
made
it
impossible
,
even
for
old
Mr.
Ablewhite
,
to
mistake
her
any
longer
.
<EOS>
His
thermometer
went
up
another
degree
,
and
his
voice
when
he
next
spoke
,
ceased
to
be
the
voice
which
is
appropriate
to
a
notoriously
good
-
natured
man
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
to
understand
,
then
,
"
he
said
,
"
that
your
marriage
engagement
is
broken
off
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
to
understand
that
,
Mr.
Ablewhite
,
if
you
please
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
also
to
take
it
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
the
proposal
to
withdraw
from
the
engagement
came
,
in
the
first
instance
,
from
YOU
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
came
,
in
the
first
instance
,
from
me
.
<EOS>
And
it
met
,
as
I
have
told
you
,
with
your
son
's
consent
and
approval
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
thermometer
went
up
to
the
top
of
the
register
.
<EOS>
I
mean
,
the
pink
changed
suddenly
to
scarlet
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
son
is
a
mean
-
spirited
hound
!
"
<EOS>
cried
this
furious
old
worldling
.
"
<EOS>
In
justice
to
myself
as
his
father
 
not
in
justice
to
HIM
 
<EOS>
I
beg
to
ask
you
,
Miss
Verinder
,
what
complaint
you
have
to
make
of
Mr.
Godfrey
Ablewhite
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Here
Mr.
Bruff
interfered
for
the
first
time
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
not
bound
to
answer
that
question
,
"
he
said
to
Rachel
.
  
<EOS>
Old
Mr.
Ablewhite
fastened
on
him
instantly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
forget
,
sir
,
"
he
said
,
"
that
you
are
a
self
-
invited
guest
here
.
<EOS>
Your
interference
would
have
come
with
a
better
grace
if
you
had
waited
until
it
was
asked
for
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Bruff
took
no
notice
.
<EOS>
The
smooth
varnish
on
HIS
wicked
old
face
never
cracked
.
<EOS>
Rachel
thanked
him
for
the
advice
he
had
given
to
her
,
and
then
turned
to
old
Mr.
Ablewhite
 
preserving
her
composure
in
a
manner
which
(
having
regard
to
her
age
and
her
sex
)
was
simply
awful
to
see
.
  
<EOS>
"
Your
son
put
the
same
question
to
me
which
you
have
just
asked
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
had
only
one
answer
for
him
,
and
I
have
only
one
answer
for
you
.
<EOS>
I
proposed
that
we
should
release
each
other
,
because
reflection
had
convinced
me
that
I
should
best
consult
his
welfare
and
mine
by
retracting
a
rash
promise
,
and
leaving
him
free
to
make
his
choice
elsewhere
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
has
my
son
done
?
"
persisted
Mr.
Ablewhite
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
a
right
to
know
that
.
<EOS>
What
has
my
son
done
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
persisted
just
as
obstinately
on
her
side
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
had
the
only
explanation
which
I
think
it
necessary
to
give
to
you
,
or
to
him
,
"
she
answered
.
  
<EOS>
"
In
plain
English
,
it
's
your
sovereign
will
and
pleasure
,
Miss
Verinder
,
to
jilt
my
son
?
"
  
<EOS>
Rachel
was
silent
for
a
moment
.
<EOS>
Sitting
close
behind
her
,
I
heard
her
sigh
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bruff
took
her
hand
,
and
gave
it
a
little
squeeze
.
<EOS>
She
recovered
herself
,
and
answered
Mr.
Ablewhite
as
boldly
as
ever
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
exposed
myself
to
worse
misconstruction
than
that
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
And
I
have
borne
it
patiently
.
<EOS>
The
time
has
gone
by
,
when
you
could
mortify
me
by
calling
me
a
jilt
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
spoke
with
a
bitterness
of
tone
which
satisfied
me
that
the
scandal
of
the
Moonstone
had
been
in
some
way
recalled
to
her
mind
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
more
to
say
,
"
she
added
,
wearily
,
not
addressing
the
words
to
anyone
in
particular
,
and
looking
away
from
us
all
,
out
of
the
window
that
was
nearest
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Ablewhite
got
upon
his
feet
,
and
pushed
away
his
chair
so
violently
that
it
toppled
over
and
fell
on
the
floor
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
something
more
to
say
on
my
side
,
"
he
announced
,
bringing
down
the
flat
of
his
hand
on
the
table
with
a
bang
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
to
say
that
if
my
son
does
n't
feel
this
insult
,
I
do
!
"
  
<EOS>
Rachel
started
,
and
looked
at
him
in
sudden
surprise
.
  
<EOS>
"
Insult
?
<EOS>
"
she
repeated
.
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Insult
!
"
reiterated
Mr.
Ablewhite
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
your
motive
,
Miss
Verinder
,
for
breaking
your
promise
to
my
son
!
<EOS>
I
know
it
as
certainly
as
if
you
had
confessed
it
in
so
many
words
.
<EOS>
Your
cursed
family
pride
is
insulting
Godfrey
,
as
it
insulted
ME
when
I
married
your
aunt
.
<EOS>
Her
family
 
her
beggarly
family
 
turned
their
backs
on
her
for
marrying
an
honest
man
,
who
had
made
his
own
place
and
won
his
own
fortune
.
<EOS>
I
had
no
ancestors
.
<EOS>
I
was
n't
descended
from
a
set
of
cut
-
throat
scoundrels
who
lived
by
robbery
and
murder
.
<EOS>
I
could
n't
point
to
the
time
when
the
Ablewhites
had
n't
a
shirt
to
their
backs
,
and
could
n't
sign
their
own
names
.
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
I
was
n't
good
enough
for
the
Herncastles
,
when
I
married
.
<EOS>
And
now
,
it
comes
to
the
pinch
,
my
son
is
n't
good
enough
for
YOU
.
<EOS>
I
suspected
it
,
all
along
.
<EOS>
You
have
got
the
Herncastle
blood
in
you
,
my
young
lady
!
<EOS>
I
suspected
it
all
along
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
very
unworthy
suspicion
,
"
remarked
Mr.
Bruff
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
astonished
that
you
have
the
courage
to
acknowledge
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Before
Mr.
Ablewhite
could
find
words
to
answer
in
,
Rachel
spoke
in
a
tone
of
the
most
exasperating
contempt
.
  
<EOS>
"
Surely
,
"
she
said
to
the
lawyer
,
"
this
is
beneath
notice
.
<EOS>
If
he
can
think
in
THAT
way
,
let
us
leave
him
to
think
as
he
pleases
.
"
  
<EOS>
From
scarlet
,
Mr.
Ablewhite
was
now
becoming
purple
.
<EOS>
He
gasped
for
breath
;
he
looked
backwards
and
forwards
from
Rachel
to
Mr.
Bruff
in
such
a
frenzy
of
rage
with
both
of
them
that
he
did
n't
know
which
to
attack
first
.
<EOS>
His
wife
,
who
had
sat
impenetrably
fanning
herself
up
to
this
time
,
began
to
be
alarmed
,
and
attempted
,
quite
uselessly
,
to
quiet
him
.
<EOS>
I
had
,
throughout
this
distressing
interview
,
felt
more
than
one
inward
call
to
interfere
with
a
few
earnest
words
,
and
had
controlled
myself
under
a
dread
of
the
possible
results
,
very
unworthy
of
a
Christian
Englishwoman
who
looks
,
not
to
what
is
meanly
prudent
,
but
to
what
is
morally
right
.
<EOS>
At
the
point
at
which
matters
had
now
arrived
,
I
rose
superior
to
all
considerations
of
mere
expediency
.
<EOS>
If
I
had
contemplated
interposing
any
remonstrance
of
my
own
humble
devising
,
I
might
possibly
have
still
hesitated
.
<EOS>
But
the
distressing
domestic
emergency
which
now
confronted
me
,
was
most
marvellously
and
beautifully
provided
for
in
the
Correspondence
of
Miss
Jane
Ann
Stamper
 
Letter
one
thousand
and
one
,
on
"
Peace
in
Families
.
<EOS>
"
I
rose
in
my
modest
corner
,
and
I
opened
my
precious
book
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
Mr.
Ablewhite
,
"
I
said
,
"
one
word
!
"
  
<EOS>
When
I
first
attracted
the
attention
of
the
company
by
rising
,
I
could
see
that
he
was
on
the
point
of
saying
something
rude
to
me
.
<EOS>
My
sisterly
form
of
address
checked
him
.
<EOS>
He
stared
at
me
in
heathen
astonishment
.
  
<EOS>
"
As
an
affectionate
well
-
wisher
and
friend
,
"
I
proceeded
,
"
and
as
one
long
accustomed
to
arouse
,
convince
,
prepare
,
enlighten
,
and
fortify
others
,
permit
me
to
take
the
most
pardonable
of
all
liberties
 
the
liberty
of
composing
your
mind
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
began
to
recover
himself
;
he
was
on
the
point
of
breaking
out
 
he
WOULD
have
broken
out
,
with
anybody
else
.
<EOS>
But
my
voice
(
habitually
gentle
)
possesses
a
high
note
or
so
,
in
emergencies
.
<EOS>
In
this
emergency
,
I
felt
imperatively
called
upon
to
have
the
highest
voice
of
the
two
.
  
<EOS>
I
held
up
my
precious
book
before
him
;
I
rapped
the
open
page
impressively
with
my
forefinger
.
"
<EOS>
Not
my
words
!
<EOS>
"
I
exclaimed
,
in
a
burst
of
fervent
interruption
.
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
do
n't
suppose
that
I
claim
attention
for
My
humble
words
!
<EOS>
Manna
in
the
wilderness
,
Mr.
Ablewhite
!
<EOS>
Dew
on
the
parched
earth
!
<EOS>
Words
of
comfort
,
words
of
wisdom
,
words
of
love
 
the
blessed
,
blessed
,
blessed
words
of
Miss
Jane
Ann
Stamper
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
was
stopped
there
by
a
momentary
impediment
of
the
breath
.
<EOS>
Before
I
could
recover
myself
,
this
monster
in
human
form
shouted
out
furiously
,
  
"
Miss
Jane
Ann
Stamper
be
 
!
"
  
<EOS>
It
is
impossible
for
me
to
write
the
awful
word
,
which
is
here
represented
by
a
blank
.
<EOS>
I
shrieked
as
it
passed
his
lips
;
I
flew
to
my
little
bag
on
the
side
table
;
I
shook
out
all
my
tracts
;
I
seized
the
one
particular
tract
on
profane
swearing
,
entitled
,
"
<EOS>
Hush
,
for
Heaven
's
Sake
!
"
<EOS>
;
I
handed
it
to
him
with
an
expression
of
agonised
entreaty
.
<EOS>
He
tore
it
in
two
,
and
threw
it
back
at
me
across
the
table
.
<EOS>
The
rest
of
them
rose
in
alarm
,
not
knowing
what
might
happen
next
.
<EOS>
I
instantly
sat
down
again
in
my
corner
.
<EOS>
There
had
once
been
an
occasion
,
under
somewhat
similar
circumstances
,
when
Miss
Jane
Ann
Stamper
had
been
taken
by
the
two
shoulders
and
turned
out
of
a
room
.
<EOS>
I
waited
,
inspired
by
HER
spirit
,
for
a
repetition
of
HER
martyrdom
.
  
<EOS>
But
no
 
it
was
not
to
be
.
<EOS>
His
wife
was
the
next
person
whom
he
addressed
.
<EOS>
"
Who
 
who
 
who
,
"
he
said
,
stammering
with
rage
,
"
who
asked
this
impudent
fanatic
into
the
house
?
<EOS>
Did
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
Before
Aunt
Ablewhite
could
say
a
word
,
Rachel
answered
for
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Clack
is
here
,
"
she
said
,
"
as
my
guest
.
"
  
<EOS>
Those
words
had
a
singular
effect
on
Mr.
Ablewhite
.
<EOS>
They
suddenly
changed
him
from
a
man
in
a
state
of
red
-
hot
anger
to
a
man
in
a
state
of
icy
-
cold
contempt
.
<EOS>
It
was
plain
to
everybody
that
Rachel
had
said
something
 
short
and
plain
as
her
answer
had
been
 
which
gave
him
the
upper
hand
of
her
at
last
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
?
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
Miss
Clack
is
here
as
YOUR
guest
 
in
MY
house
?
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
Rachel
's
turn
to
lose
her
temper
at
that
.
<EOS>
Her
colour
rose
,
and
her
eyes
brightened
fiercely
.
<EOS>
She
turned
to
the
lawyer
,
and
,
pointing
to
Mr.
Ablewhite
,
asked
haughtily
,
"
What
does
he
mean
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Bruff
interfered
for
the
third
time
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
appear
to
forget
,
"
he
said
,
addressing
Mr.
Ablewhite
,
"
that
you
took
this
house
as
Miss
Verinder
's
guardian
,
for
Miss
Verinder
's
use
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Not
quite
so
fast
,
"
interposed
Mr.
Ablewhite
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
a
last
word
to
say
,
which
I
should
have
said
some
time
since
,
if
this
 
"
He
looked
my
way
,
pondering
what
abominable
name
<EOS>
he
should
call
me
 
"
if
this
Rampant
Spinster
had
not
interrupted
us
.
<EOS>
I
beg
to
inform
you
,
sir
,
that
,
if
my
son
is
not
good
enough
to
be
Miss
Verinder
's
husband
,
I
can
not
presume
to
consider
his
father
good
enough
to
be
Miss
Verinder
's
guardian
.
<EOS>
Understand
,
if
you
please
,
that
I
refuse
to
accept
the
position
which
is
offered
to
me
by
Lady
Verinder
's
will
.
<EOS>
In
your
legal
phrase
,
I
decline
to
act
.
<EOS>
This
house
has
necessarily
been
hired
in
my
name
.
<EOS>
I
take
the
entire
responsibility
of
it
on
my
shoulders
.
<EOS>
It
is
my
house
.
<EOS>
I
can
keep
it
,
or
let
it
,
just
as
I
please
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
wish
to
hurry
Miss
Verinder
.
<EOS>
On
the
contrary
,
I
beg
her
to
remove
her
guest
and
her
luggage
,
at
her
own
entire
convenience
.
"
<EOS>
He
made
a
low
bow
,
and
walked
out
of
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
That
was
Mr.
Ablewhite
's
revenge
on
Rachel
,
for
refusing
to
marry
his
son
!
  
<EOS>
The
instant
the
door
closed
,
Aunt
Ablewhite
exhibited
a
phenomenon
which
silenced
us
all
.
<EOS>
She
became
endowed
with
energy
enough
to
cross
the
room
!
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
"
she
said
,
taking
Rachel
by
the
hand
,
"
I
should
be
ashamed
of
my
husband
,
if
I
did
n't
know
that
it
is
his
temper
which
has
spoken
to
you
,
and
not
himself
.
<EOS>
You
,
"
continued
Aunt
Ablewhite
,
turning
on
me
in
my
corner
with
another
endowment
of
energy
,
in
her
looks
this
time
instead
of
her
limbs
 
<EOS>
"
you
are
the
mischievous
person
who
irritated
him
.
<EOS>
I
hope
I
shall
never
see
you
or
your
tracts
again
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
went
back
to
Rachel
and
kissed
her
.
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
my
dear
,
"
she
said
,
"
in
my
husband
's
name
.
<EOS>
What
can
I
do
for
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
Consistently
perverse
in
everything
 
capricious
and
unreasonable
in
all
the
actions
of
her
life
 
Rachel
melted
into
tears
at
those
commonplace
words
,
and
returned
her
aunt
's
kiss
in
silence
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
may
be
permitted
to
answer
for
Miss
Verinder
,
"
said
Mr.
Bruff
,
"
might
I
ask
you
,
Mrs.
Ablewhite
,
to
send
Penelope
down
with
her
mistress
's
bonnet
and
shawl
.
<EOS>
Leave
us
ten
minutes
together
,
"
he
added
,
in
a
lower
tone
,
"
and
you
may
rely
on
my
setting
matters
right
,
to
your
satisfaction
as
well
as
to
Rachel
's
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
trust
of
the
family
in
this
man
was
something
wonderful
to
see
.
<EOS>
Without
a
word
more
,
on
her
side
,
Aunt
Ablewhite
left
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
said
Mr.
Bruff
,
looking
after
her
.
"
<EOS>
The
Herncastle
blood
has
its
drawbacks
,
I
admit
.
<EOS>
But
there
IS
something
in
good
breeding
after
all
!
"
  
<EOS>
Having
made
that
purely
worldly
remark
,
he
looked
hard
at
my
corner
,
as
if
he
expected
me
to
go
.
<EOS>
My
interest
in
Rachel
 
an
infinitely
higher
interest
than
his
 
riveted
me
to
my
chair
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Bruff
gave
it
up
,
exactly
as
he
had
given
it
up
at
Aunt
Verinder
's
,
in
Montagu
Square
.
<EOS>
He
led
Rachel
to
a
chair
by
the
window
,
and
spoke
to
her
there
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
young
lady
,
"
he
said
,
"
Mr.
Ablewhite
's
conduct
has
naturally
shocked
you
,
and
taken
you
by
surprise
.
<EOS>
If
it
was
worth
while
to
contest
the
question
with
such
a
man
,
we
might
soon
show
him
that
he
is
not
to
have
things
all
his
own
way
.
<EOS>
But
it
is
n't
worth
while
.
<EOS>
You
were
quite
right
in
what
you
said
just
now
;
he
is
beneath
our
notice
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
stopped
,
and
looked
round
at
my
corner
.
<EOS>
I
sat
there
quite
immovable
,
with
my
tracts
at
my
elbow
and
with
Miss
Jane
Ann
Stamper
on
my
lap
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
,
"
he
resumed
,
turning
back
again
to
Rachel
,
"
that
it
was
part
of
your
poor
mother
's
fine
nature
always
to
see
the
best
of
the
people
about
her
,
and
never
the
worst
.
<EOS>
She
named
her
brother
-
in
-
law
your
guardian
because
she
believed
in
him
,
and
because
she
thought
it
would
please
her
sister
.
<EOS>
I
had
never
liked
Mr.
Ablewhite
myself
,
and
I
induced
your
mother
to
let
me
insert
a
clause
in
the
will
,
empowering
her
executors
,
in
certain
events
,
to
consult
with
me
about
the
appointment
of
a
new
guardian
.
<EOS>
One
of
those
events
has
happened
to
-
day
;
and
I
find
myself
in
a
position
to
end
all
these
dry
business
details
,
I
hope
agreeably
,
with
a
message
from
my
wife
.
<EOS>
Will
you
honour
Mrs.
Bruff
by
becoming
her
guest
?
<EOS>
And
will
you
remain
under
my
roof
,
and
be
one
of
my
family
,
until
we
wise
people
have
laid
our
heads
together
,
and
have
settled
what
is
to
be
done
next
?
"
  
<EOS>
At
those
words
,
I
rose
to
interfere
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bruff
had
done
exactly
what
I
had
dreaded
he
would
do
,
when
he
asked
Mrs.
Ablewhite
for
Rachel
's
bonnet
and
shawl
.
  
<EOS>
Before
I
could
interpose
a
word
,
Rachel
had
accepted
his
invitation
in
the
warmest
terms
.
<EOS>
If
I
suffered
the
arrangement
thus
made
between
them
to
be
carried
out
 
if
she
once
passed
the
threshold
of
Mr.
Bruff
's
door
 
farewell
to
the
fondest
hope
of
my
life
,
the
hope
of
bringing
my
lost
sheep
back
to
the
fold
!
<EOS>
The
bare
idea
of
such
a
calamity
as
this
quite
overwhelmed
me
.
<EOS>
I
cast
the
miserable
trammels
of
worldly
discretion
to
the
winds
,
and
spoke
with
the
fervour
that
filled
me
,
in
the
words
that
came
first
.
  
<EOS>
"
Stop
!
"
<EOS>
I
said
 
"
stop
!
<EOS>
I
must
be
heard
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bruff
!
<EOS>
you
are
not
related
to
her
,
and
I
am
.
<EOS>
I
invite
her
 
<EOS>
I
summon
the
executors
to
appoint
me
guardian
.
<EOS>
Rachel
,
dearest
Rachel
,
I
offer
you
my
modest
home
;
come
to
London
by
the
next
train
,
love
,
and
share
it
with
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Bruff
said
nothing
.
<EOS>
Rachel
looked
at
me
with
a
cruel
astonishment
which
she
made
no
effort
to
conceal
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
very
kind
,
Drusilla
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
hope
to
visit
you
whenever
I
happen
to
be
in
London
.
<EOS>
But
I
have
accepted
Mr.
Bruff
's
invitation
,
and
I
think
it
will
be
best
,
for
the
present
,
if
I
remain
under
Mr.
Bruff
's
care
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
do
n't
say
so
!
<EOS>
"
I
pleaded
.
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
part
with
you
,
Rachel
 
I
ca
n't
part
with
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
I
tried
to
fold
her
in
my
arms
.
<EOS>
But
she
drew
back
.
<EOS>
My
fervour
did
not
communicate
itself
;
it
only
alarmed
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Surely
,
"
she
said
,
"
this
is
a
very
unnecessary
display
of
agitation
?
<EOS>
I
do
n't
understand
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
more
do
I
,
"
said
Mr.
Bruff
.
  
<EOS>
Their
hardness
 
their
hideous
,
worldly
hardness
 
revolted
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Rachel
!
<EOS>
Rachel
!
<EOS>
"
I
burst
out
.
"
<EOS>
Have
n't
you
seen
yet
,
that
my
heart
yearns
to
make
a
Christian
of
you
?
<EOS>
Has
no
inner
voice
told
you
that
I
am
trying
to
do
for
you
,
what
I
was
trying
to
do
for
your
dear
mother
when
death
snatched
her
out
of
my
hands
?
"
  
<EOS>
Rachel
advanced
a
step
nearer
,
and
looked
at
me
very
strangely
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
understand
your
reference
to
my
mother
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
Miss
Clack
,
will
you
have
the
goodness
to
explain
yourself
?
"
  
<EOS>
Before
I
could
answer
,
Mr.
Bruff
came
forward
,
and
offering
his
arm
to
Rachel
,
tried
to
lead
her
out
of
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
had
better
not
pursue
the
subject
,
my
dear
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
And
Miss
Clack
had
better
not
explain
herself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
If
I
had
been
a
stock
or
a
stone
,
such
an
interference
as
this
must
have
roused
me
into
testifying
to
the
truth
.
<EOS>
I
put
Mr.
Bruff
aside
indignantly
with
my
own
hand
,
and
,
in
solemn
and
suitable
language
,
I
stated
the
view
with
which
sound
doctrine
does
not
scruple
to
regard
the
awful
calamity
of
dying
unprepared
.
  
<EOS>
Rachel
started
back
from
me
 
<EOS>
I
blush
to
write
 
with
a
scream
of
horror
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
away
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
to
Mr.
Bruff
.
"
<EOS>
Come
away
,
for
God
's
sake
,
before
that
woman
can
say
any
more
!
<EOS>
Oh
,
think
of
my
poor
mother
's
harmless
,
useful
,
beautiful
life
!
<EOS>
You
were
at
the
funeral
,
Mr.
Bruff
;
you
saw
how
everybody
loved
her
;
you
saw
the
poor
helpless
people
crying
at
her
grave
over
the
loss
of
their
best
friend
.
<EOS>
And
that
wretch
stands
there
,
and
tries
to
make
me
doubt
that
my
mother
,
who
was
an
angel
on
earth
,
is
an
angel
in
heaven
now
!
<EOS>
Do
n't
stop
to
talk
about
it
!
<EOS>
Come
away
!
<EOS>
It
stifles
me
to
breathe
the
same
air
with
her
!
<EOS>
It
frightens
me
to
feel
that
we
are
in
the
same
room
together
!
"
  
<EOS>
Deaf
to
all
remonstrance
,
she
ran
to
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
At
the
same
moment
,
her
maid
entered
with
her
bonnet
and
shawl
.
<EOS>
She
huddled
them
on
anyhow
.
<EOS>
"
Pack
my
things
,
"
she
said
,
"
and
bring
them
to
Mr.
Bruff
's
.
<EOS>
"
I
attempted
to
approach
her
 
<EOS>
I
was
shocked
and
grieved
,
but
,
it
is
needless
to
say
,
not
offended
.
<EOS>
I
only
wished
to
say
to
her
,
"
May
your
hard
heart
be
softened
!
<EOS>
I
freely
forgive
you
!
"
<EOS>
She
pulled
down
her
veil
,
and
tore
her
shawl
away
from
my
hand
,
and
,
hurrying
out
,
shut
the
door
in
my
face
.
<EOS>
I
bore
the
insult
with
my
customary
fortitude
.
<EOS>
I
remember
it
now
with
my
customary
superiority
to
all
feeling
of
offence
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Bruff
had
his
parting
word
of
mockery
for
me
,
before
he
too
hurried
out
,
in
his
turn
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
had
better
not
have
explained
yourself
,
Miss
Clack
,
"
he
said
,
and
bowed
,
and
left
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
The
person
with
the
cap
-
ribbons
followed
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
easy
to
see
who
has
set
them
all
by
the
ears
together
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
only
a
poor
servant
 
<EOS>
but
I
declare
I
'm
ashamed
of
you
!
"
<EOS>
She
too
went
out
,
and
banged
the
door
after
her
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
left
alone
in
the
room
.
<EOS>
Reviled
by
them
all
,
deserted
by
them
all
,
I
was
left
alone
in
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
Is
there
more
to
be
added
to
this
plain
statement
of
facts
 
to
this
touching
picture
of
a
Christian
persecuted
by
the
world
?
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
my
diary
reminds
me
that
one
more
of
the
many
chequered
chapters
in
my
life
ends
here
.
<EOS>
From
that
day
forth
,
I
never
saw
Rachel
Verinder
again
.
<EOS>
She
had
my
forgiveness
at
the
time
when
she
insulted
me
.
<EOS>
She
has
had
my
prayerful
good
wishes
ever
since
.
<EOS>
And
when
I
die
 
to
complete
the
return
on
my
part
of
good
for
evil
 
<EOS>
she
will
have
the
LIFE
,
LETTERS
,
AND
LABOURS
OF
MISS
JANE
ANN
STAMPER
left
her
as
a
legacy
by
my
will

<EOS>
My
fair
friend
,
Miss
Clack
,
having
laid
down
the
pen
,
there
are
two
reasons
for
my
taking
it
up
next
,
in
my
turn
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
first
place
,
I
am
in
a
position
to
throw
the
necessary
light
on
certain
points
of
interest
which
have
thus
far
been
left
in
the
dark
.
<EOS>
Miss
Verinder
had
her
own
private
reason
for
breaking
her
marriage
engagement
 
<EOS>
and
I
was
at
the
bottom
of
it
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Godfrey
Ablewhite
had
his
own
private
reason
for
withdrawing
all
claim
to
the
hand
of
his
charming
cousin
 
<EOS>
and
I
discovered
what
it
was
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
second
place
,
it
was
my
good
or
ill
fortune
,
I
hardly
know
which
,
to
find
myself
personally
involved
 
at
the
period
of
which
I
am
now
writing
 
in
the
mystery
of
the
Indian
Diamond
.
<EOS>
I
had
the
honour
of
an
interview
,
at
my
own
office
,
with
an
Oriental
stranger
of
distinguished
manners
,
who
was
no
other
,
unquestionably
,
than
the
chief
of
the
three
Indians
.
<EOS>
Add
to
this
,
that
I
met
with
the
celebrated
traveller
,
Mr.
Murthwaite
,
the
day
afterwards
,
and
that
I
held
a
conversation
with
him
on
the
subject
of
the
Moonstone
,
which
has
a
very
important
bearing
on
later
events
.
<EOS>
And
there
you
have
the
statement
of
my
claims
to
fill
the
position
which
I
occupy
in
these
pages
.
  
<EOS>
The
true
story
of
the
broken
marriage
engagement
comes
first
in
point
of
time
,
and
must
therefore
take
the
first
place
in
the
present
narrative
.
<EOS>
Tracing
my
way
back
along
the
chain
of
events
,
from
one
end
to
the
other
,
I
find
it
necessary
to
open
the
scene
,
oddly
enough
as
you
will
think
,
at
the
bedside
of
my
excellent
client
and
friend
,
the
late
Sir
John
Verinder
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
John
had
his
share
 
perhaps
rather
a
large
share
 
of
the
more
harmless
and
amiable
of
the
weaknesses
incidental
to
humanity
.
<EOS>
Among
these
,
I
may
mention
as
applicable
to
the
matter
in
hand
,
an
invincible
reluctance
 
so
long
as
he
enjoyed
his
usual
good
health
 
to
face
the
responsibility
of
making
his
will
.
<EOS>
Lady
Verinder
exerted
her
influence
to
rouse
him
to
a
sense
of
duty
in
this
matter
;
and
I
exerted
my
influence
.
<EOS>
He
admitted
the
justice
of
our
views
 
but
he
went
no
further
than
that
,
until
he
found
himself
afflicted
with
the
illness
which
ultimately
brought
him
to
his
grave
.
<EOS>
Then
,
I
was
sent
for
at
last
,
to
take
my
client
's
instructions
on
the
subject
of
his
will
.
<EOS>
They
proved
to
be
the
simplest
instructions
I
had
ever
received
in
the
whole
of
my
professional
career
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
John
was
dozing
,
when
I
entered
the
room
.
<EOS>
He
roused
himself
at
the
sight
of
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
do
,
Mr.
Bruff
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
sha'n't
be
very
long
about
this
.
<EOS>
And
then
I
'll
go
to
sleep
again
.
"
<EOS>
He
looked
on
with
great
interest
while
I
collected
pens
,
ink
,
and
paper
.
"
<EOS>
Are
you
ready
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
.
<EOS>
I
bowed
and
took
a
dip
of
ink
,
and
waited
for
my
instructions
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
leave
everything
to
my
wife
,
"
said
Sir
John
.
<EOS>
"
That
's
all
.
"
<EOS>
He
turned
round
on
his
pillow
,
and
composed
himself
to
sleep
again
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
obliged
to
disturb
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Am
I
to
understand
,
"
I
asked
,
"
that
you
leave
the
whole
of
the
property
,
of
every
sort
and
description
,
of
which
you
die
possessed
,
absolutely
to
Lady
Verinder
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Sir
John
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Only
,
I
put
it
shorter
.
<EOS>
Why
ca
n't
you
put
it
shorter
,
and
let
me
go
to
sleep
again
?
<EOS>
Everything
to
my
wife
.
<EOS>
That
's
my
Will
.
"
  
<EOS>
His
property
was
entirely
at
his
own
disposal
,
and
was
of
two
kinds
.
<EOS>
Property
in
land
<EOS>
(
I
purposely
abstain
from
using
technical
language
)
,
and
property
in
money
.
<EOS>
In
the
majority
of
cases
,
I
am
afraid
I
should
have
felt
it
<EOS>
my
duty
to
my
client
to
ask
him
to
reconsider
his
Will
.
<EOS>
In
the
case
of
Sir
John
,
I
knew
Lady
Verinder
to
be
,
not
only
worthy
of
the
unreserved
trust
which
her
husband
had
placed
in
her
(
all
good
wives
are
worthy
of
that
)
 
but
to
be
also
capable
of
properly
administering
a
trust
(
which
,
in
my
experience
of
the
fair
sex
,
not
one
in
a
thousand
of
them
is
competent
to
do
)
.
<EOS>
In
ten
minutes
,
Sir
John
's
Will
was
drawn
,
and
executed
,
and
Sir
John
himself
,
good
man
,
was
finishing
his
interrupted
nap
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Verinder
amply
justified
the
confidence
which
her
husband
had
placed
in
her
.
<EOS>
In
the
first
days
of
her
widowhood
,
she
sent
for
me
,
and
made
her
Will
.
<EOS>
The
view
she
took
of
her
position
was
so
thoroughly
sound
and
sensible
,
that
I
was
relieved
of
all
necessity
for
advising
her
.
<EOS>
My
responsibility
began
and
ended
with
shaping
her
instructions
into
the
proper
legal
form
.
<EOS>
Before
Sir
John
had
been
a
fortnight
in
his
grave
,
the
future
of
his
daughter
had
been
most
wisely
and
most
affectionately
provided
for
.
  
<EOS>
The
Will
remained
in
its
fireproof
box
at
my
office
,
through
more
years
than
I
like
to
reckon
up
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
till
the
summer
of
eighteen
hundred
and
forty
-
eight
that
I
found
occasion
to
look
at
it
again
under
very
melancholy
circumstances
.
  
<EOS>
At
the
date
I
have
mentioned
,
the
doctors
pronounced
the
sentence
on
poor
Lady
Verinder
,
which
was
literally
a
sentence
of
death
.
<EOS>
I
was
the
first
person
whom
she
informed
of
her
situation
;
and
I
found
her
anxious
to
go
over
her
Will
again
with
me
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
impossible
to
improve
the
provisions
relating
to
her
daughter
.
<EOS>
But
,
in
the
lapse
of
time
,
her
wishes
in
regard
to
certain
minor
legacies
,
left
to
different
relatives
,
had
undergone
some
modification
;
and
it
became
necessary
to
add
three
or
four
Codicils
to
the
original
document
.
<EOS>
Having
done
this
at
once
,
for
fear
of
accident
,
I
obtained
her
ladyship
's
permission
to
embody
her
recent
instructions
in
a
second
Will
.
<EOS>
My
object
was
to
avoid
certain
inevitable
confusions
and
repetitions
which
now
disfigured
the
original
document
,
and
which
,
to
own
the
truth
,
grated
sadly
on
my
professional
sense
of
the
fitness
of
things
.
  
<EOS>
The
execution
of
this
second
Will
has
been
described
by
Miss
Clack
,
who
was
so
obliging
as
to
witness
it
.
<EOS>
So
far
as
regarded
Rachel
Verinder
's
pecuniary
interests
,
it
was
,
word
for
word
,
the
exact
counterpart
of
the
first
Will
.
<EOS>
The
only
changes
introduced
related
to
the
appointment
of
a
guardian
,
and
to
certain
provisions
concerning
that
appointment
,
which
were
made
under
my
advice
.
<EOS>
On
Lady
Verinder
's
death
,
the
Will
was
placed
in
the
hands
of
my
proctor
to
be
"
proved
"
(
as
the
phrase
is
)
in
the
usual
way
.
  
<EOS>
In
about
three
weeks
from
that
time
 
as
well
as
I
can
remember
 
the
first
warning
reached
me
of
something
unusual
going
on
under
the
surface
.
<EOS>
I
happened
to
be
looking
in
at
my
friend
the
proctor
's
office
,
and
I
observed
that
he
received
me
with
an
appearance
of
greater
interest
than
usual
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
some
news
for
you
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
think
I
heard
at
Doctors
'
Commons
this
morning
?
<EOS>
Lady
Verinder
's
Will
has
been
asked
for
,
and
examined
,
already
!
"
  
<EOS>
This
was
news
indeed
!
<EOS>
There
was
absolutely
nothing
which
could
be
contested
in
the
Will
;
and
there
was
nobody
I
could
think
of
who
had
the
slightest
interest
in
examining
it
.
<EOS>
(
I
shall
perhaps
do
well
<EOS>
if
I
explain
in
this
place
,
for
the
benefit
of
the
few
people
who
do
n't
know
it
already
,
that
the
law
allows
all
Wills
to
be
examined
at
Doctors
'
Commons
by
anybody
who
applies
,
on
the
payment
of
a
shilling
fee
.
)
  
<EOS>
"
Did
you
hear
who
asked
for
the
Will
?
"
I
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
the
clerk
had
no
hesitation
in
telling
ME
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Smalley
,
of
the
firm
of
Skipp
and
Smalley
,
asked
for
it
.
<EOS>
The
Will
has
not
been
copied
yet
into
the
great
Folio
Registers
.
<EOS>
So
there
was
no
alternative
but
to
depart
from
the
usual
course
,
and
to
let
him
see
the
original
document
.
<EOS>
He
looked
it
over
carefully
,
and
made
a
note
in
his
pocket
-
book
.
<EOS>
Have
you
any
idea
of
what
he
wanted
with
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
I
shook
my
head
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
find
out
,
"
I
answered
,
"
before
I
am
a
day
older
.
"
<EOS>
With
that
I
went
back
at
once
to
my
own
office
.
  
<EOS>
If
any
other
firm
of
solicitors
had
been
concerned
in
this
unaccountable
examination
of
my
deceased
client
's
Will
,
I
might
have
found
some
difficulty
in
making
the
necessary
discovery
.
<EOS>
But
I
had
a
hold
over
Skipp
and
Smalley
which
made
my
course
in
this
matter
a
comparatively
easy
one
.
<EOS>
My
common
-
law
clerk
(
a
most
competent
and
excellent
man
)
was
a
brother
of
Mr.
Smalley
's
;
and
,
owing
to
this
sort
of
indirect
connection
with
me
,
Skipp
and
Smalley
had
,
for
some
years
past
,
picked
up
the
crumbs
that
fell
from
my
table
,
in
the
shape
of
cases
brought
to
my
office
,
which
,
for
various
reasons
,
I
did
not
think
it
worth
while
to
undertake
.
<EOS>
My
professional
patronage
was
,
in
this
way
,
of
some
importance
to
the
firm
.
<EOS>
I
intended
,
if
necessary
,
to
remind
them
of
that
patronage
,
on
the
present
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
The
moment
I
got
back
<EOS>
I
spoke
to
my
clerk
;
and
,
after
telling
him
what
had
happened
,
I
sent
him
to
his
brother
's
office
,
"
with
Mr.
Bruff
's
compliments
,
and
he
would
be
glad
to
know
why
Messrs.
Skipp
and
Smalley
had
found
it
necessary
to
examine
Lady
Verinder
's
will
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
message
brought
Mr.
Smalley
back
to
my
office
in
company
with
his
brother
.
<EOS>
He
acknowledged
that
he
had
acted
under
instructions
received
from
a
client
.
<EOS>
And
then
he
put
it
to
me
,
whether
it
would
not
be
a
breach
of
professional
confidence
on
his
part
to
say
more
.
  
<EOS>
We
had
a
smart
discussion
upon
that
.
<EOS>
He
was
right
,
no
doubt
;
and
I
was
wrong
.
<EOS>
The
truth
is
,
I
was
angry
and
suspicious
 
<EOS>
and
I
insisted
on
knowing
more
.
<EOS>
Worse
still
,
I
declined
to
consider
any
additional
information
offered
me
,
as
a
secret
placed
in
my
keeping
:
I
claimed
perfect
freedom
to
use
my
own
discretion
.
<EOS>
Worse
even
than
that
,
I
took
an
unwarrantable
advantage
of
my
position
.
<EOS>
"
Choose
,
sir
,
"
I
said
to
Mr.
Smalley
,
"
between
the
risk
of
losing
your
client
's
business
and
the
risk
of
losing
Mine
.
"
<EOS>
Quite
indefensible
,
I
admit
 
an
act
of
tyranny
,
and
nothing
less
.
<EOS>
Like
other
tyrants
,
I
carried
my
point
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Smalley
chose
his
alternative
,
without
a
moment
's
hesitation
.
  
<EOS>
He
smiled
resignedly
,
and
gave
up
the
name
of
his
client
:
  
Mr.
Godfrey
Ablewhite
.
  
<EOS>
That
was
enough
for
me
 
<EOS>
I
wanted
to
know
no
more
.
  
<EOS>
Having
reached
this
point
in
my
narrative
,
it
now
becomes
necessary
to
place
the
reader
of
these
lines
 
so
far
as
Lady
Verinder
's
Will
is
concerned
 
on
a
footing
of
perfect
equality
,
in
respect
of
information
,
with
myself
.
  
<EOS>
Let
me
state
,
then
,
in
the
fewest
possible
words
,
that
Rachel
Verinder
had
nothing
but
a
life
-
interest
in
the
property
.
<EOS>
Her
mother
's
excellent
sense
,
and
my
long
experience
,
had
combined
to
relieve
her
of
all
responsibility
,
and
to
guard
her
from
all
danger
of
becoming
the
victim
in
the
future
of
some
needy
and
unscrupulous
man
.
<EOS>
Neither
she
,
nor
her
husband
(
if
she
married
)
,
could
raise
sixpence
,
either
on
the
property
in
land
,
or
on
the
property
in
money
.
<EOS>
They
would
have
the
houses
in
London
and
in
Yorkshire
to
live
in
,
and
they
would
have
the
handsome
income
 
<EOS>
and
that
was
all
.
  
<EOS>
When
I
came
to
think
over
what
I
had
discovered
,
I
was
sorely
perplexed
what
to
do
next
.
  
<EOS>
Hardly
a
week
had
passed
since
I
had
heard
(
to
my
surprise
and
distress
)
of
Miss
Verinder
's
proposed
marriage
.
<EOS>
I
had
the
sincerest
admiration
and
affection
for
her
;
and
I
had
been
inexpressibly
grieved
when
I
heard
that
she
was
about
to
throw
herself
away
on
Mr.
Godfrey
Ablewhite
.
<EOS>
And
now
,
here
was
the
man
 
whom
I
had
always
believed
to
be
a
smooth
-
tongued
impostor
 
justifying
the
very
worst
that
I
had
thought
of
him
,
and
plainly
revealing
the
mercenary
object
of
the
marriage
,
on
his
side
!
<EOS>
And
what
of
that
?
 
<EOS>
you
may
reply
 
<EOS>
the
thing
is
done
every
day
.
<EOS>
Granted
,
my
dear
sir
.
<EOS>
But
would
you
think
of
it
quite
as
lightly
as
you
do
,
if
the
thing
was
done
(
let
us
say
)
with
your
own
sister
?
  
<EOS>
The
first
consideration
which
now
naturally
occurred
to
me
was
this
.
<EOS>
Would
Mr.
Godfrey
Ablewhite
hold
to
his
engagement
,
after
what
his
lawyer
had
discovered
for
him
?
  
<EOS>
It
depended
entirely
on
his
pecuniary
position
,
of
which
I
knew
nothing
.
<EOS>
If
that
position
was
not
a
desperate
one
,
it
would
be
well
worth
his
while
to
marry
Miss
Verinder
for
her
income
alone
.
<EOS>
If
,
on
the
other
hand
,
he
stood
in
urgent
need
of
realising
a
large
sum
by
a
given
time
,
then
Lady
Verinder
's
Will
would
exactly
meet
the
case
,
and
would
preserve
her
daughter
from
falling
into
a
scoundrel
's
hands
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
latter
event
,
there
would
be
no
need
for
me
to
distress
Miss
Rachel
,
in
the
first
days
of
her
mourning
for
her
mother
,
by
an
immediate
revelation
of
the
truth
.
<EOS>
In
the
former
event
,
if
I
remained
silent
,
I
should
be
conniving
at
a
marriage
which
would
make
her
miserable
for
life
.
  
<EOS>
My
doubts
ended
in
my
calling
at
the
hotel
in
London
,
at
which
I
knew
Mrs.
Ablewhite
and
Miss
Verinder
to
be
staying
.
<EOS>
They
informed
me
that
they
were
going
to
Brighton
the
next
day
,
and
that
an
unexpected
obstacle
prevented
Mr.
Godfrey
Ablewhite
from
accompanying
them
.
<EOS>
I
at
once
proposed
to
take
his
place
.
<EOS>
While
I
was
only
thinking
of
Rachel
Verinder
,
it
was
possible
to
hesitate
.
<EOS>
When
I
actually
saw
her
,
my
mind
was
made
up
directly
,
come
what
might
of
it
,
to
tell
her
the
truth
.
  
<EOS>
I
found
my
opportunity
,
when
I
was
out
walking
with
her
,
on
the
day
after
my
arrival
.
  
<EOS>
"
May
I
speak
to
you
,
"
I
asked
,
"
about
your
marriage
engagement
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
she
said
,
indifferently
,
"
if
you
have
nothing
more
interesting
to
talk
about
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
forgive
an
old
friend
and
servant
of
your
family
,
Miss
Rachel
,
if
I
venture
on
asking
whether
your
heart
is
set
on
this
marriage
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
marrying
in
despair
,
<EOS>
Mr.
Bruff
 
on
the
chance
of
dropping
into
some
sort
of
stagnant
happiness
which
may
reconcile
me
to
my
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Strong
language
!
<EOS>
and
suggestive
of
something
below
the
surface
,
in
the
shape
of
a
romance
.
<EOS>
But
I
had
my
own
object
in
view
,
and
I
declined
(
as
we
lawyers
say
)
to
pursue
the
question
into
its
side
issues
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Godfrey
Ablewhite
can
hardly
be
of
your
way
of
thinking
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
HIS
heart
must
be
set
on
the
marriage
at
any
rate
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
says
so
,
and
I
suppose
I
ought
to
believe
him
.
<EOS>
He
would
hardly
marry
me
,
after
what
I
have
owned
to
him
,
unless
he
was
fond
of
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Poor
thing
!
<EOS>
the
bare
idea
of
a
man
marrying
her
for
his
own
selfish
and
mercenary
ends
had
never
entered
her
head
.
<EOS>
The
task
I
had
set
myself
began
to
look
like
a
harder
task
than
I
had
bargained
for
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
sounds
strangely
,
"
<EOS>
I
went
on
,
"
in
my
old
-
fashioned
ears
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
What
sounds
strangely
?
"
she
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
To
hear
you
speak
of
your
future
husband
as
if
you
were
not
quite
sure
of
the
sincerity
of
his
attachment
.
<EOS>
Are
you
conscious
of
any
reason
in
your
own
mind
for
doubting
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
Her
astonishing
quickness
of
perception
,
detected
a
change
in
my
voice
,
or
my
manner
,
when
I
put
that
question
,
which
warned
her
that
I
had
been
speaking
all
along
with
some
ulterior
object
in
view
.
<EOS>
She
stopped
,
and
taking
her
arm
out
of
mine
,
looked
me
searchingly
in
the
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Bruff
,
"
she
said
,
"
you
have
something
to
tell
me
about
Godfrey
Ablewhite
.
<EOS>
Tell
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
knew
her
well
enough
to
take
her
at
her
word
.
<EOS>
I
told
it
.
  
<EOS>
She
put
her
arm
again
into
mine
,
and
walked
on
with
me
slowly
.
<EOS>
I
felt
her
hand
tightening
its
grasp
mechanically
on
my
arm
,
and
I
saw
her
getting
paler
and
paler
as
I
went
on
 
<EOS>
but
,
not
a
word
passed
her
lips
while
I
was
speaking
.
<EOS>
When
I
had
done
,
she
still
kept
silence
.
<EOS>
Her
head
drooped
a
little
,
and
she
walked
by
my
side
,
unconscious
of
my
presence
,
unconscious
of
everything
about
her
;
lost
 
buried
<EOS>
,
I
might
almost
say
 
in
her
own
thoughts
.
  
<EOS>
I
made
no
attempt
to
disturb
her
.
<EOS>
My
experience
of
her
disposition
warned
me
,
on
this
,
as
on
former
occasions
,
to
give
her
time
.
  
<EOS>
The
first
instinct
of
girls
in
general
,
on
being
told
of
anything
which
interests
them
,
is
to
ask
a
multitude
of
questions
,
and
then
to
run
off
,
and
talk
it
all
over
with
some
favourite
friend
.
<EOS>
Rachel
Verinder
's
first
instinct
,
under
similar
circumstances
,
was
to
shut
herself
up
in
her
own
mind
,
and
to
think
it
over
by
herself
.
<EOS>
This
absolute
self
-
dependence
is
a
great
virtue
in
a
man
.
<EOS>
In
a
woman
it
has
a
serious
drawback
of
morally
separating
her
from
the
mass
of
her
sex
,
and
so
exposing
her
to
misconstruction
by
the
general
opinion
.
<EOS>
I
strongly
suspect
myself
of
thinking
as
the
rest
of
the
world
think
in
this
matter
 
except
in
the
case
of
Rachel
Verinder
.
<EOS>
The
self
-
dependence
in
HER
character
,
was
one
of
its
virtues
in
my
estimation
;
partly
,
no
doubt
,
because
I
sincerely
admired
and
liked
her
;
partly
,
because
the
view
I
took
of
her
connexion
with
the
loss
of
the
Moonstone
was
based
on
my
own
special
knowledge
of
her
disposition
.
<EOS>
Badly
as
appearances
might
look
,
in
the
matter
of
the
Diamond
 
shocking
as
it
undoubtedly
was
to
know
that
she
was
associated
in
any
way
with
the
mystery
of
an
undiscovered
theft
 
<EOS>
I
was
satisfied
nevertheless
that
she
had
done
nothing
unworthy
of
her
,
because
I
was
also
satisfied
that
she
had
not
stirred
a
step
in
the
business
,
without
shutting
herself
up
in
her
own
mind
,
and
thinking
it
over
first
.
  
<EOS>
We
had
walked
on
,
for
nearly
a
mile
I
should
say
before
Rachel
roused
herself
.
<EOS>
She
suddenly
looked
up
at
me
with
a
faint
reflection
of
her
smile
of
happier
times
 
the
most
irresistible
smile
I
have
ever
seen
on
a
woman
's
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
owe
much
already
to
your
kindness
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
And
I
feel
more
deeply
indebted
to
it
now
than
ever
.
<EOS>
If
you
hear
any
rumours
of
my
marriage
when
you
get
back
to
London
contradict
them
at
once
,
on
my
authority
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Have
you
resolved
to
break
your
engagement
?
"
I
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
Can
you
doubt
it
?
"
<EOS>
she
returned
proudly
,
"
after
what
you
have
told
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Miss
Rachel
,
you
are
very
young
 
<EOS>
and
you
may
find
more
difficulty
in
withdrawing
from
your
present
position
than
you
anticipate
.
<EOS>
Have
you
no
one
 
<EOS>
I
mean
a
lady
,
of
course
 
whom
you
could
consult
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
one
,
"
she
answered
.
  
<EOS>
It
distressed
me
<EOS>
,
it
did
indeed
distress
me
,
to
hear
her
say
that
.
<EOS>
She
was
so
young
and
so
lonely
 
<EOS>
and
she
bore
it
so
well
!
<EOS>
The
impulse
to
help
her
got
the
better
of
any
sense
of
my
own
unfitness
which
I
might
have
felt
under
the
circumstances
;
and
I
stated
such
ideas
on
the
subject
as
occurred
to
me
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
,
to
the
best
of
my
ability
.
<EOS>
I
have
advised
a
prodigious
number
of
clients
,
and
have
dealt
with
some
exceedingly
awkward
difficulties
,
in
my
time
.
<EOS>
But
this
was
the
first
occasion
on
which
I
had
ever
found
myself
advising
a
young
lady
how
to
obtain
her
release
from
a
marriage
engagement
.
<EOS>
The
suggestion
I
offered
amounted
briefly
to
this
.
<EOS>
I
recommended
her
to
tell
Mr.
Godfrey
Ablewhite
 
at
a
private
interview
,
of
course
 
that
he
had
,
to
her
certain
knowledge
,
betrayed
the
mercenary
nature
of
the
motive
on
his
side
.
<EOS>
She
was
then
to
add
that
their
marriage
,
after
what
she
had
discovered
,
was
a
simple
impossibility
 
<EOS>
and
she
was
to
put
it
to
him
,
whether
he
thought
it
wisest
to
secure
her
silence
by
falling
in
with
her
views
,
or
to
force
her
,
by
opposing
them
,
to
make
the
motive
under
which
she
was
acting
generally
known
.
<EOS>
If
he
attempted
to
defend
himself
,
or
to
deny
the
facts
,
she
was
,
in
that
event
,
to
refer
him
to
ME
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Verinder
listened
attentively
till
I
had
done
.
<EOS>
She
then
thanked
me
very
prettily
for
my
advice
,
but
informed
me
at
the
same
time
that
it
was
impossible
for
her
to
follow
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
May
I
ask
,
"
I
said
,
"
what
objection
you
see
to
following
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
hesitated
 
and
then
met
me
with
a
question
on
her
side
.
  
<EOS>
"
Suppose
you
were
asked
to
express
your
opinion
of
Mr.
Godfrey
Ablewhite
's
conduct
?
<EOS>
"
she
began
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
would
you
call
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
call
it
the
conduct
of
a
meanly
deceitful
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Bruff
!
<EOS>
I
have
believed
in
that
man
.
<EOS>
I
have
promised
to
marry
that
man
.
<EOS>
How
can
I
tell
him
he
is
mean
<EOS>
,
how
can
I
tell
him
he
has
deceived
me
,
how
can
I
disgrace
him
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
after
that
?
<EOS>
I
have
degraded
myself
by
ever
thinking
of
him
as
my
husband
.
<EOS>
If
I
say
what
you
tell
me
to
say
to
him
 
<EOS>
I
am
owning
that
I
have
degraded
myself
to
his
face
.
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
do
that
.
<EOS>
After
what
has
passed
between
us
,
I
ca
n't
do
that
!
<EOS>
The
shame
of
it
would
be
nothing
to
HIM
.
<EOS>
But
the
shame
of
it
would
be
unendurable
to
_
me
_
.
"
  
<EOS>
Here
was
another
of
the
marked
peculiarities
in
her
character
disclosing
itself
to
me
without
reserve
.
<EOS>
Here
was
her
sensitive
horror
of
the
bare
contact
with
anything
mean
,
blinding
her
to
every
consideration
of
what
she
owed
to
herself
,
hurrying
her
into
a
false
position
which
might
compromise
her
in
the
estimation
of
all
her
friends
!
<EOS>
Up
to
this
time
,
I
had
been
a
little
diffident
about
the
propriety
of
the
advice
I
had
given
to
her
.
<EOS>
But
,
after
what
she
had
just
said
,
I
had
no
sort
of
doubt
that
it
was
the
best
advice
that
could
have
been
offered
;
and
I
felt
no
sort
of
hesitation
in
pressing
it
on
her
again
.
  
<EOS>
She
only
shook
her
head
,
and
repeated
her
objection
in
other
words
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
has
been
intimate
enough
with
me
to
ask
me
to
be
his
wife
.
<EOS>
He
has
stood
high
enough
in
my
estimation
to
obtain
my
consent
.
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
tell
him
to
his
face
that
he
is
the
most
contemptible
of
living
creatures
,
after
that
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
my
dear
Miss
Rachel
,
"
I
remonstrated
,
"
it
's
equally
impossible
for
you
to
tell
him
that
you
withdraw
from
your
engagement
without
giving
some
reason
for
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
say
that
I
have
thought
it
over
,
and
that
I
am
satisfied
it
will
be
best
for
both
of
us
if
we
part
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
more
than
that
?
"
  
"
No
more
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Have
you
thought
of
what
he
may
say
,
on
his
side
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
may
say
what
he
pleases
.
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
impossible
not
to
admire
her
delicacy
and
her
resolution
,
and
it
was
equally
impossible
not
to
feel
that
she
was
putting
herself
in
the
wrong
.
<EOS>
I
entreated
her
to
consider
her
own
position
.
<EOS>
I
reminded
her
that
she
would
be
exposing
herself
to
the
most
odious
misconstruction
of
her
motives
.
<EOS>
"
You
ca
n't
brave
public
opinion
,
"
I
said
,
"
at
the
command
of
private
feeling
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
,
"
she
answered
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
done
it
already
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
forgotten
the
Moonstone
,
Mr.
Bruff
.
<EOS>
Have
I
not
braved
public
opinion
,
THERE
,
with
my
own
private
reasons
for
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
Her
answer
silenced
me
for
the
moment
.
<EOS>
It
set
me
trying
to
trace
the
explanation
of
her
conduct
,
at
the
time
of
the
loss
of
the
Moonstone
,
out
of
the
strange
avowal
which
had
just
escaped
her
.
<EOS>
I
might
perhaps
have
done
it
when
I
was
younger
.
<EOS>
I
certainly
could
n't
do
it
now
.
  
<EOS>
I
tried
a
last
remonstrance
before
we
returned
to
the
house
.
<EOS>
She
was
just
as
immovable
as
ever
.
<EOS>
My
mind
was
in
a
strange
conflict
of
feelings
about
her
when
I
left
her
that
day
.
<EOS>
She
was
obstinate
;
she
was
wrong
.
<EOS>
She
was
interesting
;
she
was
admirable
;
she
was
deeply
to
be
pitied
.
<EOS>
I
made
her
promise
to
write
to
me
the
moment
she
had
any
news
to
send
.
<EOS>
And
I
went
back
to
my
business
in
London
,
with
a
mind
exceedingly
ill
at
ease
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
evening
of
my
return
,
before
it
was
possible
for
me
to
receive
my
promised
letter
,
I
was
surprised
by
a
visit
from
Mr.
Ablewhite
the
elder
,
and
was
informed
that
Mr.
Godfrey
had
got
his
dismissal
 
AND
HAD
ACCEPTED
<EOS>
IT
 
<EOS>
that
very
day
.
  
<EOS>
With
the
view
I
already
took
of
the
case
,
the
bare
fact
stated
in
the
words
that
I
have
underlined
,
revealed
Mr.
Godfrey
Ablewhite
's
motive
for
submission
as
plainly
as
if
he
had
acknowledged
it
himself
.
<EOS>
He
needed
a
large
sum
of
money
;
and
he
needed
it
by
a
given
time
.
<EOS>
Rachel
's
income
,
which
would
have
helped
him
to
anything
else
,
would
not
help
him
here
;
and
Rachel
had
accordingly
released
herself
,
without
encountering
a
moment
's
serious
opposition
on
his
part
.
<EOS>
If
I
am
told
that
this
is
a
mere
speculation
,
I
ask
,
<EOS>
in
my
turn
,
what
other
theory
will
account
for
his
giving
up
a
marriage
which
would
have
maintained
him
in
splendour
for
the
rest
of
his
life
?
  
<EOS>
Any
exultation
I
might
otherwise
have
felt
at
the
lucky
turn
which
things
had
now
taken
,
was
effectually
checked
by
what
passed
at
my
interview
with
old
Mr.
Ablewhite
.
  
<EOS>
He
came
,
of
course
,
to
know
whether
I
could
give
him
any
explanation
of
Miss
Verinder
's
extraordinary
conduct
.
<EOS>
It
is
needless
to
say
that
I
was
quite
unable
to
afford
him
the
information
he
wanted
.
<EOS>
The
annoyance
which
I
thus
inflicted
,
following
on
the
irritation
produced
by
a
recent
interview
with
his
son
,
threw
Mr.
Ablewhite
off
his
guard
.
<EOS>
Both
his
looks
and
his
language
convinced
me
that
Miss
Verinder
would
find
him
a
merciless
man
to
deal
with
,
when
he
joined
the
ladies
at
Brighton
the
next
day
.
  
<EOS>
I
had
a
restless
night
,
considering
what
I
ought
to
do
next
.
<EOS>
How
my
reflections
ended
,
and
how
thoroughly
well
founded
my
distrust
of
Mr.
Ablewhite
<EOS>
proved
to
be
,
are
items
of
information
which
(
as
I
am
told
)
have
already
been
put
tidily
in
their
proper
places
,
by
that
exemplary
person
,
Miss
Clack
.
<EOS>
I
have
only
to
add
 
in
completion
of
her
narrative
 
that
Miss
Verinder
found
the
quiet
and
repose
which
she
sadly
needed
,
poor
thing
,
in
my
house
at
Hampstead
.
<EOS>
She
honoured
us
by
making
a
long
stay
.
<EOS>
My
wife
and
daughters
were
charmed
with
her
;
and
,
when
the
executors
decided
on
the
appointment
of
a
new
guardian
,
I
feel
sincere
pride
and
pleasure
in
recording
that
my
guest
and
my
family
parted
like
old
friends
,
on
either
side
.
    
<EOS>
The
next
thing
I
have
to
do
,
is
to
present
such
additional
information
as
I
possess
on
the
subject
of
the
Moonstone
,
or
,
to
speak
more
correctly
,
on
the
subject
of
the
Indian
plot
to
steal
the
Diamond
.
<EOS>
The
little
that
I
have
to
tell
is
(
as
I
think
I
have
already
said
)
of
some
importance
,
nevertheless
,
in
respect
of
its
bearing
very
remarkably
on
events
which
are
still
to
come
.
  
<EOS>
About
a
week
or
ten
days
after
Miss
Verinder
had
left
us
,
one
of
my
clerks
entered
the
private
room
at
my
office
,
with
a
card
in
his
hand
,
and
informed
me
that
a
gentleman
was
below
,
who
wanted
to
speak
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
looked
at
the
card
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
foreign
name
written
on
it
,
which
has
escaped
my
memory
.
<EOS>
It
was
followed
by
a
line
written
in
English
at
the
bottom
of
the
card
,
which
I
remember
perfectly
well
:
  
"
Recommended
by
Mr.
Septimus
Luker
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
audacity
of
a
person
in
Mr.
Luker
's
position
presuming
to
recommend
anybody
to
me
,
took
me
so
completely
by
surprise
,
that
I
sat
silent
for
the
moment
,
wondering
whether
my
own
eyes
had
not
deceived
me
.
<EOS>
The
clerk
,
observing
my
bewilderment
,
favoured
me
with
the
result
of
his
own
observation
of
the
stranger
who
was
waiting
downstairs
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
rather
a
remarkable
-
looking
man
,
sir
.
<EOS>
So
dark
in
the
complexion
that
we
all
set
him
down
in
the
office
for
an
Indian
,
or
something
of
that
sort
.
"
  
<EOS>
Associating
the
clerk
's
idea
with
the
line
inscribed
on
the
card
in
my
hand
,
I
thought
it
possible
that
the
Moonstone
might
be
at
the
bottom
of
Mr.
Luker
's
recommendation
,
and
of
the
stranger
's
visit
at
my
office
.
<EOS>
To
the
astonishment
of
my
clerk
,
I
at
once
decided
on
granting
an
interview
to
the
gentleman
below
.
  
<EOS>
In
justification
of
the
highly
unprofessional
sacrifice
to
mere
curiosity
which
I
thus
made
,
permit
me
to
remind
anybody
who
may
read
these
lines
,
that
no
living
person
(
in
England
,
at
any
rate
)
can
claim
to
have
had
such
an
intimate
connexion
with
the
romance
of
the
Indian
Diamond
as
mine
has
been
.
<EOS>
I
was
trusted
with
the
secret
of
Colonel
Herncastle
's
plan
for
escaping
assassination
.
<EOS>
I
received
the
Colonel
's
letters
,
periodically
reporting
himself
a
living
man
.
<EOS>
I
drew
his
Will
,
leaving
the
Moonstone
to
Miss
Verinder
.
<EOS>
I
persuaded
his
executor
to
act
,
on
the
chance
that
the
jewel
might
prove
to
be
a
valuable
acquisition
to
the
family
.
<EOS>
And
,
lastly
,
I
combated
Mr.
Franklin
Blake
's
scruples
,
and
induced
him
to
be
the
means
of
transporting
the
Diamond
to
Lady
Verinder
's
house
.
<EOS>
If
anyone
can
claim
a
prescriptive
right
of
interest
in
the
Moonstone
,
and
in
everything
connected
with
it
,
I
think
it
is
hardly
to
be
denied
that
I
am
the
man
.
  
<EOS>
The
moment
my
mysterious
client
was
shown
in
,
I
felt
an
inner
conviction
that
I
was
in
the
presence
of
one
of
the
three
Indians
 
probably
of
the
chief
.
<EOS>
He
was
carefully
dressed
in
European
costume
.
<EOS>
But
his
swarthy
complexion
,
his
long
lithe
figure
,
and
his
grave
and
graceful
politeness
of
manner
were
enough
to
betray
his
Oriental
origin
to
any
intelligent
eyes
that
looked
at
him
.
  
<EOS>
I
pointed
to
a
chair
,
and
begged
to
be
informed
of
the
nature
of
his
business
with
me
.
  
<EOS>
After
first
apologising
 
in
an
excellent
selection
of
English
words
 
for
the
liberty
which
he
had
taken
in
disturbing
me
,
the
Indian
produced
a
small
parcel
the
outer
covering
of
which
was
of
cloth
of
gold
.
<EOS>
Removing
this
and
a
second
wrapping
of
some
silken
fabric
,
he
placed
a
little
box
,
or
casket
,
on
my
table
,
most
beautifully
and
richly
inlaid
in
jewels
,
on
an
ebony
ground
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
come
,
sir
,
"
he
said
,
"
to
ask
you
to
lend
me
some
money
.
<EOS>
And
I
leave
this
as
an
assurance
to
you
that
my
debt
will
be
paid
back
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
pointed
to
his
card
.
"
<EOS>
And
you
apply
to
me
,
"
I
rejoined
,
"
at
Mr.
Luker
's
recommendation
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
Indian
bowed
.
  
<EOS>
"
May
I
ask
how
it
is
that
Mr.
Luker
himself
did
not
advance
the
money
that
you
require
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Luker
informed
me
,
sir
,
that
he
had
no
money
to
lend
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
so
he
recommended
you
to
come
to
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
Indian
,
in
his
turn
,
pointed
to
the
card
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
written
there
,
"
he
said
.
  
<EOS>
Briefly
answered
,
and
thoroughly
to
the
purpose
!
<EOS>
If
the
Moonstone
had
been
in
my
possession
,
this
Oriental
gentleman
would
have
murdered
me
,
I
am
well
aware
,
without
a
moment
's
hesitation
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
,
and
barring
that
slight
drawback
,
I
am
bound
to
testify
that
he
was
the
perfect
model
of
a
client
.
<EOS>
He
might
not
have
respected
my
life
.
<EOS>
But
he
did
what
none
of
my
own
countrymen
had
ever
done
,
in
all
my
experience
of
them
 
he
respected
my
time
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
,
"
I
said
,
"
that
you
should
have
had
the
trouble
of
coming
to
me
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Luker
is
quite
mistaken
in
sending
you
here
.
<EOS>
I
am
trusted
,
like
other
men
in
my
profession
,
with
money
to
lend
.
<EOS>
But
I
never
lend
it
to
strangers
,
and
I
never
lend
it
on
such
a
security
as
you
have
produced
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Far
from
attempting
,
as
other
people
would
have
done
,
to
induce
me
to
relax
my
own
rules
,
the
Indian
only
made
me
another
bow
,
and
wrapped
up
his
box
in
its
two
coverings
without
a
word
of
protest
.
<EOS>
He
rose
 
this
admirable
assassin
rose
to
go
,
the
moment
I
had
answered
him
!
  
<EOS>
"
Will
your
condescension
towards
a
stranger
,
excuse
my
asking
one
question
,
"
he
said
,
"
before
I
take
my
leave
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
bowed
on
my
side
.
<EOS>
Only
one
question
at
parting
!
<EOS>
The
average
in
my
experience
was
fifty
.
  
<EOS>
"
Supposing
,
sir
,
it
had
been
possible
(
and
customary
)
for
you
to
lend
me
the
money
,
"
he
said
,
"
in
what
space
of
time
would
it
have
been
possible
(
and
customary
)
for
me
to
pay
it
back
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
According
to
the
usual
course
pursued
in
this
country
,
"
I
answered
,
"
you
would
have
been
entitled
to
pay
the
money
back
(
if
you
liked
)
in
one
year
's
time
from
the
date
at
which
it
was
first
advanced
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
Indian
made
me
a
last
bow
,
the
lowest
of
all
 
and
suddenly
and
softly
walked
out
of
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
done
in
a
moment
,
in
a
noiseless
,
supple
,
cat
-
like
way
,
which
a
little
startled
me
,
I
own
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
I
was
composed
enough
to
think
,
I
arrived
at
one
distinct
conclusion
in
reference
to
the
otherwise
incomprehensible
visitor
who
had
favoured
me
with
a
call
.
  
<EOS>
His
face
,
voice
,
and
manner
 
while
I
was
in
his
company
 
were
under
such
perfect
control
that
they
set
all
scrutiny
at
defiance
.
<EOS>
But
he
had
given
me
one
chance
of
looking
under
the
smooth
outer
surface
of
him
,
for
all
that
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
shown
the
slightest
sign
of
attempting
to
fix
anything
that
I
had
said
to
him
in
his
mind
,
until
I
mentioned
the
time
at
which
it
was
customary
to
permit
the
earliest
repayment
,
on
the
part
of
a
debtor
,
of
money
that
had
been
advanced
as
a
loan
.
<EOS>
When
I
gave
him
that
piece
of
information
,
he
looked
me
straight
in
the
face
,
while
I
was
speaking
,
for
the
first
time
.
<EOS>
The
inference
I
drew
from
this
was
 
that
he
had
a
special
purpose
in
asking
me
his
last
question
,
and
a
special
interest
in
hearing
my
answer
to
it
.
<EOS>
The
more
carefully
I
reflected
on
what
had
passed
between
us
,
the
more
shrewdly
I
suspected
the
production
of
the
casket
,
and
the
application
for
the
loan
,
of
having
been
mere
formalities
,
designed
to
pave
the
way
for
the
parting
inquiry
addressed
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
had
satisfied
myself
of
the
correctness
of
this
conclusion
 
and
was
trying
to
get
on
a
step
further
,
and
penetrate
the
Indian
's
motives
next
 
when
a
letter
was
brought
to
me
,
which
proved
to
be
from
no
less
a
person
that
Mr.
Septimus
Luker
himself
.
<EOS>
He
asked
my
pardon
in
terms
of
sickening
servility
,
and
assured
me
that
he
could
explain
matters
to
my
satisfaction
,
if
I
would
honour
him
by
consenting
to
a
personal
interview
.
  
<EOS>
I
made
another
unprofessional
sacrifice
to
mere
curiosity
.
<EOS>
I
honoured
him
by
making
an
appointment
at
my
office
,
for
the
next
day
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Luker
was
,
in
every
respect
,
such
an
inferior
creature
to
the
Indian
 
<EOS>
he
was
so
vulgar
,
so
ugly
,
so
cringing
,
and
so
prosy
 
that
he
is
quite
unworthy
of
being
reported
,
at
any
length
,
in
these
pages
.
<EOS>
The
substance
of
what
he
had
to
tell
me
may
be
fairly
stated
as
follows
:
  
<EOS>
The
day
before
I
had
received
the
visit
of
the
Indian
,
Mr.
Luker
had
been
favoured
with
a
call
from
that
accomplished
gentleman
.
<EOS>
In
spite
of
his
European
disguise
,
Mr.
Luker
had
instantly
identified
his
visitor
with
the
chief
of
the
three
Indians
,
who
had
formerly
annoyed
him
by
loitering
about
his
house
,
and
who
had
left
him
no
alternative
but
to
consult
a
magistrate
.
<EOS>
From
this
startling
discovery
he
had
rushed
to
the
conclusion
(
naturally
enough
I
own
)
that
he
must
certainly
be
in
the
company
of
one
of
the
three
men
,
who
had
blindfolded
him
,
gagged
him
,
and
robbed
him
of
his
banker
's
receipt
.
<EOS>
The
result
was
that
he
became
quite
paralysed
with
terror
,
and
that
he
firmly
believed
his
last
hour
had
come
.
  
<EOS>
On
his
side
,
the
Indian
preserved
the
character
of
a
perfect
stranger
.
<EOS>
He
produced
the
little
casket
,
and
made
exactly
the
same
application
which
he
had
afterwards
made
to
me
.
<EOS>
As
the
speediest
way
of
getting
rid
of
him
,
Mr.
Luker
had
at
once
declared
that
he
had
no
money
.
<EOS>
The
Indian
had
thereupon
asked
to
be
informed
of
the
best
and
safest
person
to
apply
to
for
the
loan
he
wanted
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Luker
had
answered
that
the
best
and
safest
person
,
in
such
cases
,
was
usually
a
respectable
solicitor
.
<EOS>
Asked
to
name
some
individual
of
that
character
and
profession
,
Mr.
Luker
had
mentioned
me
 
for
the
one
simple
reason
that
,
in
the
extremity
of
his
terror
,
mine
was
the
first
name
which
occurred
to
him
.
<EOS>
"
The
perspiration
was
pouring
off
me
like
rain
,
sir
,
"
the
wretched
creature
concluded
.
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
know
what
I
was
talking
about
.
<EOS>
And
I
hope
you
'll
look
over
it
,
Mr.
Bruff
,
sir
,
in
consideration
of
my
having
been
really
and
truly
frightened
out
of
my
wits
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
excused
the
fellow
graciously
enough
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
readiest
way
of
releasing
myself
from
the
sight
of
him
.
<EOS>
Before
he
left
me
,
I
detained
him
to
make
one
inquiry
.
  
<EOS>
Had
the
Indian
said
anything
noticeable
,
at
the
moment
of
quitting
Mr.
Luker
's
house
?
  
<EOS>
Yes
!
<EOS>
The
Indian
had
put
precisely
the
same
question
to
Mr.
Luker
,
at
parting
,
which
he
had
put
to
me
;
receiving
of
course
,
the
same
answer
as
the
answer
which
I
had
given
him
.
  
<EOS>
What
did
it
mean
?
<EOS>
Mr.
Luker
's
explanation
gave
me
no
assistance
towards
solving
the
problem
.
<EOS>
My
own
unaided
ingenuity
,
consulted
next
,
proved
quite
unequal
to
grapple
with
the
difficulty
.
<EOS>
I
had
a
dinner
engagement
that
evening
;
and
I
went
upstairs
,
in
no
very
genial
frame
of
mind
,
little
suspecting
that
the
way
to
my
dressing
-
room
and
the
way
to
discovery
,
meant
,
on
this
particular
occasion
,
<EOS>
one
and
the
same
thing
.
    
<EOS>
The
prominent
personage
among
the
guests
at
the
dinner
party
I
found
to
be
Mr.
Murthwaite
.
  
<EOS>
On
his
appearance
in
England
,
after
his
wanderings
,
society
had
been
greatly
interested
in
the
traveller
,
as
a
man
who
had
passed
through
many
dangerous
adventures
,
and
who
had
escaped
to
tell
the
tale
.
<EOS>
He
had
now
announced
his
intention
of
returning
to
the
scene
of
his
exploits
,
and
of
penetrating
into
regions
left
still
unexplored
.
<EOS>
This
magnificent
indifference
to
placing
his
safety
in
peril
for
the
second
time
,
revived
the
flagging
interest
of
the
worshippers
in
the
hero
.
<EOS>
The
law
of
chances
was
clearly
against
his
escaping
on
this
occasion
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
every
day
that
we
can
meet
an
eminent
person
at
dinner
,
and
feel
that
there
is
a
reasonable
prospect
of
the
news
of
his
murder
being
the
news
that
we
hear
of
him
next
.
  
<EOS>
When
the
gentlemen
were
left
by
themselves
in
the
dining
-
room
,
I
found
myself
sitting
next
to
Mr.
Murthwaite
.
<EOS>
The
guests
present
being
all
English
,
it
is
needless
to
say
that
,
as
soon
as
the
wholesome
check
exercised
by
the
presence
of
the
ladies
was
removed
,
the
conversation
turned
on
politics
as
a
necessary
result
.
  
<EOS>
In
respect
to
this
all
-
absorbing
national
topic
,
I
happen
to
be
one
of
the
most
un
-
English
Englishmen
living
.
<EOS>
As
a
general
rule
,
political
talk
appears
to
me
to
be
of
all
talk
the
most
dreary
and
the
most
profitless
.
<EOS>
Glancing
at
Mr.
Murthwaite
,
when
the
bottles
had
made
their
first
round
of
the
table
,
I
found
that
he
was
apparently
of
my
way
of
thinking
.
<EOS>
He
was
doing
it
very
dexterously
 
with
all
possible
consideration
for
the
feelings
of
his
host
 
<EOS>
but
it
is
not
the
less
certain
that
he
was
composing
himself
for
a
nap
.
<EOS>
It
struck
me
as
an
experiment
worth
attempting
,
to
try
whether
a
judicious
allusion
to
the
subject
of
the
Moonstone
would
keep
him
awake
,
and
,
if
it
did
,
to
see
what
HE
thought
of
the
last
new
complication
in
the
Indian
conspiracy
,
as
revealed
in
the
prosaic
precincts
of
my
office
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
am
not
mistaken
,
Mr.
Murthwaite
,
"
I
began
,
"
you
were
acquainted
with
the
late
Lady
Verinder
,
and
you
took
some
interest
in
the
strange
succession
of
events
which
ended
in
the
loss
of
the
Moonstone
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
eminent
traveller
did
me
the
honour
of
waking
up
in
an
instant
,
and
asking
me
who
I
was
.
  
<EOS>
I
informed
him
of
my
professional
connection
with
the
Herncastle
family
,
not
forgetting
the
curious
position
which
I
had
occupied
towards
the
Colonel
and
his
Diamond
in
the
bygone
time
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Murthwaite
shifted
round
in
his
chair
,
so
as
to
put
the
rest
of
the
company
behind
him
(
Conservatives
and
Liberals
alike
)
,
and
concentrated
his
whole
attention
on
plain
Mr.
Bruff
,
of
Gray
's
Inn
Square
.
  
<EOS>
"
Have
you
heard
anything
,
lately
,
of
the
Indians
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
every
reason
to
believe
,
"
<EOS>
I
answered
,
"
that
one
of
them
had
an
interview
with
me
,
in
my
office
,
yesterday
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Murthwaite
was
not
an
easy
man
to
astonish
;
but
that
last
answer
of
mine
completely
staggered
him
.
<EOS>
I
described
what
had
happened
to
Mr.
Luker
,
and
what
had
happened
to
myself
,
exactly
as
I
have
described
it
here
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
clear
that
the
Indian
's
parting
inquiry
had
an
object
,
"
I
added
.
<EOS>
"
Why
should
he
be
so
anxious
to
know
the
time
at
which
a
borrower
of
money
is
usually
privileged
to
pay
the
money
back
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
it
possible
that
you
do
n't
see
his
motive
,
Mr.
Bruff
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
ashamed
of
my
stupidity
,
Mr.
Murthwaite
 
<EOS>
but
I
certainly
do
n't

it

"
  
<EOS>
The
great
traveller
became
quite
interested
in
sounding
the
immense
vacuity
of
my
dulness
to
its
lowest
depths
.
  
<EOS>
"
Let
me
ask
you
one
question
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
In
what
position
does
the
conspiracy
to
seize
the
Moonstone
now
stand
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
say
,
"
I
answered
.
<EOS>
"
The
Indian
plot
is
a
mystery
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
Indian
plot
,
Mr.
Bruff
,
can
only
be
a
mystery
to
you
,
because
you
have
never
seriously
examined
it
.
<EOS>
Shall
we
run
it
over
together
,
from
the
time
when
you
drew
Colonel
Herncastle
's
Will
,
to
the
time
when
the
Indian
called
at
your
office
?
<EOS>
In
your
position
,
it
may
be
of
very
serious
importance
to
the
interests
of
Miss
Verinder
,
that
you
should
be
able
to
take
a
clear
view
of
this
matter
in
case
of
need
.
<EOS>
Tell
me
,
bearing
that
in
mind
,
whether
you
will
penetrate
the
Indian
's
motive
for
yourself
?
<EOS>
or
whether
you
wish
me
to
save
you
the
trouble
of
making
any
inquiry
into
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
is
needless
to
say
that
I
thoroughly
appreciated
the
practical
purpose
which
I
now
saw
that
he
had
in
view
,
and
that
the
first
of
the
two
alternatives
was
the
alternative
I
chose
.
  
<EOS>
"
Very
good
,
"
said
Mr.
Murthwaite
.
<EOS>
"
We
will
take
the
question
of
the
ages
of
the
three
Indians
first
.
<EOS>
I
can
testify
that
they
all
look
much
about
the
same
age
 
and
you
can
decide
for
yourself
,
whether
the
man
whom
you
saw
was
,
or
was
not
,
in
the
prime
of
life
.
<EOS>
Not
forty
,
you
think
?
<EOS>
My
idea
too
.
<EOS>
We
will
say
not
forty
.
<EOS>
Now
look
back
to
the
time
when
Colonel
Herncastle
came
to
England
,
and
when
you
were
concerned
in
the
plan
he
adopted
to
preserve
his
life
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
want
you
to
count
the
years
.
<EOS>
I
will
only
say
,
it
is
clear
that
these
present
Indians
,
at
their
age
,
must
be
the
successors
of
three
other
Indians
(
high
caste
Brahmins
all
of
them
,
Mr.
Bruff
,
when
they
left
their
native
country
!
)
<EOS>
who
followed
the
Colonel
to
these
shores
.
<EOS>
Very
well
.
<EOS>
These
present
men
of
ours
have
succeeded
to
the
men
who
were
here
before
them
.
<EOS>
If
they
had
only
done
that
,
the
matter
would
not
have
been
worth
inquiring
into
.
<EOS>
But
they
have
done
more
.
<EOS>
They
have
succeeded
to
the
organisation
which
their
predecessors
established
in
this
country
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
start
!
<EOS>
The
organisation
is
a
very
trumpery
affair
,
according
to
our
ideas
,
I
have
no
doubt
.
<EOS>
I
should
reckon
it
up
as
including
the
command
of
money
;
<EOS>
the
services
,
when
needed
,
of
that
shady
sort
of
Englishman
,
who
lives
in
the
byways
of
foreign
life
in
London
;
and
,
lastly
,
the
secret
sympathy
of
such
few
men
of
their
own
country
,
and
(
formerly
,
at
least
)
of
their
own
religion
,
as
happen
to
be
employed
in
ministering
to
some
of
the
multitudinous
wants
of
this
great
city
.
<EOS>
Nothing
very
formidable
,
as
you
see
!
<EOS>
But
worth
notice
at
starting
,
because
we
may
find
occasion
to
refer
to
this
modest
little
Indian
organisation
as
we
go
on
.
<EOS>
Having
now
cleared
the
ground
,
I
am
going
to
ask
you
a
question
;
and
I
expect
your
experience
to
answer
it
.
<EOS>
What
was
the
event
which
gave
the
Indians
their
first
chance
of
seizing
the
Diamond
?
"
  
<EOS>
I
understood
the
allusion
to
my
experience
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
first
chance
they
got
,
"
I
replied
,
"
was
clearly
offered
to
them
by
Colonel
Herncastle
's
death
.
<EOS>
They
would
be
aware
of
his
death
,
I
suppose
,
as
a
matter
of
course
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
As
a
matter
of
course
.
<EOS>
And
his
death
,
as
you
say
,
gave
them
their
first
chance
.
<EOS>
Up
to
that
time
the
Moonstone
was
safe
in
the
strong
-
room
of
the
bank
.
<EOS>
You
drew
the
Colonel
's
Will
leaving
his
jewel
to
his
niece
;
and
the
Will
was
proved
in
the
usual
way
.
<EOS>
As
a
lawyer
,
you
can
be
at
no
loss
to
know
what
course
the
Indians
would
take
(
under
English
advice
)
after
THAT
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
would
provide
themselves
with
a
copy
of
the
Will
from
Doctors
'
Commons
,
"
I
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Exactly
.
<EOS>
One
or
other
of
those
shady
Englishmen
to
whom
I
have
alluded
,
would
get
them
the
copy
you
have
described
.
<EOS>
That
copy
would
inform
them
that
the
Moonstone
was
bequeathed
to
the
daughter
of
Lady
Verinder
,
and
that
Mr.
Blake
the
elder
,
or
some
person
appointed
by
him
,
was
to
place
it
in
her
hands
.
<EOS>
You
will
agree
with
me
that
the
necessary
information
about
persons
in
the
position
of
Lady
Verinder
and
Mr.
Blake
,
would
be
perfectly
easy
information
to
obtain
.
<EOS>
The
one
difficulty
for
the
Indians
would
be
to
decide
whether
they
should
make
their
attempt
on
the
Diamond
when
it
was
in
course
of
removal
from
the
keeping
of
the
bank
,
or
whether
they
should
wait
until
it
was
taken
down
to
Yorkshire
to
Lady
Verinder
's
house
.
<EOS>
The
second
way
would
be
manifestly
the
safest
way
 
<EOS>
and
there
you
have
the
explanation
of
the
appearance
of
the
Indians
at
Frizinghall
,
disguised
as
jugglers
,
and
waiting
their
time
.
<EOS>
In
London
,
it
is
needless
to
say
,
they
had
their
organisation
at
their
disposal
to
keep
them
informed
of
events
.
<EOS>
Two
men
would
do
it
.
<EOS>
One
to
follow
anybody
who
went
from
Mr.
Blake
's
house
to
the
bank
.
<EOS>
And
one
to
treat
the
lower
men
servants
with
beer
,
and
to
hear
the
news
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
These
commonplace
precautions
would
readily
inform
them
that
Mr.
Franklin
Blake
had
been
to
the
bank
,
and
that
Mr.
Franklin
Blake
was
the
only
person
in
the
house
who
was
going
to
visit
Lady
Verinder
.
<EOS>
What
actually
followed
upon
that
discovery
,
you
remember
,
no
doubt
,
quite
as
correctly
as
I
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
remembered
that
Franklin
Blake
had
detected
one
of
the
spies
,
in
the
street
 
that
he
had
,
in
consequence
,
advanced
the
time
of
his
arrival
in
Yorkshire
by
some
hours
 
and
that
(
thanks
to
old
Betteredge
's
excellent
advice
)
<EOS>
he
had
lodged
the
Diamond
in
the
bank
at
Frizinghall
,
before
the
Indians
were
so
much
as
prepared
to
see
him
in
the
neighbourhood
.
<EOS>
All
perfectly
clear
so
far
.
<EOS>
But
the
Indians
being
ignorant
of
the
precautions
thus
taken
,
how
was
it
that
they
had
made
no
attempt
on
Lady
Verinder
's
house
(
in
which
they
must
have
supposed
the
Diamond
to
be
)
through
the
whole
of
the
interval
that
elapsed
before
Rachel
's
birthday
?
  
<EOS>
In
putting
this
difficulty
to
Mr.
Murthwaite
,
I
thought
it
right
to
add
that
I
had
heard
of
the
little
boy
,
and
the
drop
of
ink
,
and
the
rest
of
it
,
and
that
any
explanation
based
on
the
theory
of
clairvoyance
was
an
explanation
which
would
carry
no
conviction
<EOS>
whatever
with
it
,
to
MY
mind
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nor
to
mine
either
,
"
said
Mr.
Murthwaite
.
<EOS>
"
The
clairvoyance
in
this
case
is
simply
a
development
of
the
romantic
side
of
the
Indian
character
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
refreshment
and
an
encouragement
to
those
men
 
quite
inconceivable
,
I
grant
you
,
to
the
English
mind
 
to
surround
their
wearisome
and
perilous
errand
in
this
country
with
a
certain
halo
of
the
marvellous
and
the
supernatural
.
<EOS>
Their
boy
is
unquestionably
a
sensitive
subject
to
the
mesmeric
influence
 
<EOS>
and
,
under
that
influence
,
he
has
no
doubt
reflected
what
was
already
in
the
mind
of
the
person
mesmerising
him
.
<EOS>
I
have
tested
the
theory
of
clairvoyance
 
<EOS>
and
I
have
never
found
the
manifestations
get
beyond
that
point
.
<EOS>
The
Indians
do
n't
investigate
the
matter
in
this
way
;
the
Indians
look
upon
their
boy
as
a
Seer
of
things
invisible
to
their
eyes
 
<EOS>
and
,
I
repeat
,
<EOS>
in
that
marvel
they
find
the
source
of
a
new
interest
in
the
purpose
that
unites
them
.
<EOS>
I
only
notice
this
as
offering
a
curious
view
of
human
character
,
which
must
be
quite
new
to
you
.
<EOS>
We
have
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
clairvoyance
,
or
with
mesmerism
,
or
with
anything
else
that
is
hard
of
belief
to
a
practical
man
,
in
the
inquiry
that
we
are
now
pursuing
.
<EOS>
My
object
in
following
the
Indian
plot
,
step
by
step
,
is
to
trace
results
back
,
by
rational
means
,
to
natural
causes
.
<EOS>
Have
I
succeeded
to
your
satisfaction
so
far
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
a
doubt
of
it
,
Mr.
Murthwaite
!
<EOS>
I
am
waiting
,
however
,
with
some
anxiety
,
to
hear
the
rational
explanation
of
the
difficulty
which
I
have
just
had
the
honour
of
submitting
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Murthwaite
smiled
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
the
easiest
difficulty
to
deal
with
of
all
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
Permit
me
to
begin
by
admitting
your
statement
of
the
case
as
a
perfectly
correct
one
.
<EOS>
The
Indians
were
undoubtedly
not
aware
of
what
Mr.
Franklin
Blake
had
done
with
the
Diamond
 
<EOS>
for
we
find
them
making
their
first
mistake
,
on
the
first
night
of
Mr.
Blake
's
arrival
at
his
aunt
's
house
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Their
first
mistake
?
<EOS>
"
I
repeated
.
  
<EOS>
"
Certainly
!
<EOS>
The
mistake
of
allowing
themselves
to
be
surprised
,
lurking
about
the
terrace
at
night
,
by
Gabriel
Betteredge
.
<EOS>
However
,
they
had
the
merit
of
seeing
for
themselves
that
they
had
taken
a
false
step
 
for
,
as
you
say
,
again
,
with
plenty
of
time
at
their
disposal
,
they
never
came
near
the
house
for
weeks
afterwards
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
Mr.
Murthwaite
?
<EOS>
That
's
what
I
want
to
know
!
<EOS>
Why
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Because
no
Indian
,
Mr.
Bruff
,
ever
runs
an
unnecessary
risk
.
<EOS>
The
clause
you
drew
in
Colonel
Herncastle
's
Will
,
informed
them
(
did
n't
it
?
)
<EOS>
that
the
Moonstone
was
to
pass
absolutely
into
Miss
Verinder
's
possession
on
her
birthday
.
<EOS>
Very
well
.
<EOS>
Tell
me
which
was
the
safest
course
for
men
in
their
position
?
<EOS>
To
make
their
attempt
on
the
Diamond
while
it
was
under
the
control
of
Mr.
Franklin
Blake
,
who
had
shown
already
that
he
could
suspect
and
outwit
them
?
<EOS>
Or
to
wait
till
the
Diamond
was
at
the
disposal
of
a
young
girl
,
who
would
innocently
delight
in
wearing
the
magnificent
jewel
at
every
possible
opportunity
?
<EOS>
Perhaps
you
want
a
proof
that
my
theory
is
correct
?
<EOS>
Take
the
conduct
of
the
Indians
themselves
as
the
proof
.
<EOS>
They
appeared
at
the
house
,
after
waiting
all
those
weeks
,
on
Miss
Verinder
's
birthday
;
and
they
were
rewarded
for
the
patient
accuracy
of
their
calculations
by
seeing
the
Moonstone
in
the
bosom
of
her
dress
!
<EOS>
When
I
heard
the
story
of
the
Colonel
and
the
Diamond
,
later
in
the
evening
,
I
felt
so
sure
about
the
risk
Mr.
Franklin
Blake
had
run
<EOS>
(
they
would
have
certainly
attacked
him
,
if
he
had
not
happened
to
ride
back
to
Lady
Verinder
's
in
the
company
of
other
people
)
;
and
I
was
so
strongly
convinced
of
the
worse
risk
<EOS>
still
,
in
store
for
Miss
Verinder
,
that
I
recommended
following
the
Colonel
's
plan
,
and
destroying
the
identity
of
the
gem
by
having
it
cut
into
separate
stones
.
<EOS>
How
its
extraordinary
disappearance
that
night
,
made
my
advice
useless
,
and
utterly
defeated
the
Hindoo
plot
 
and
how
all
further
action
on
the
part
of
the
Indians
was
paralysed
the
next
day
by
their
confinement
in
prison
as
rogues
and
vagabonds
 
you
know
as
well
as
I
do
.
<EOS>
The
first
act
in
the
conspiracy
closes
there
.
<EOS>
Before
we
go
on
to
the
second
,
may
I
ask
whether
I
have
met
your
difficulty
,
with
an
explanation
which
is
satisfactory
to
the
mind
of
a
practical
man
?
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
impossible
to
deny
that
he
had
met
my
difficulty
fairly
;
thanks
to
his
superior
knowledge
of
the
Indian
character
 
and
thanks
to
his
not
having
had
hundreds
of
other
Wills
to
think
of
since
Colonel
Herncastle
's
time
!
  
<EOS>
"
So
far
,
so
good
,
"
resumed
Mr.
Murthwaite
.
<EOS>
"
The
first
chance
the
Indians
had
of
seizing
the
Diamond
was
a
chance
lost
,
on
the
day
when
they
were
committed
to
the
prison
at
Frizinghall
.
<EOS>
When
did
the
second
chance
offer
itself
?
<EOS>
The
second
chance
offered
itself
 
as
I
am
in
a
condition
to
prove
 
while
they
were
still
in
confinement
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
took
out
his
pocket
-
book
,
and
opened
it
at
a
particular
leaf
,
before
he
went
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
staying
,
"
he
resumed
,
"
with
some
friends
at
Frizinghall
,
at
the
time
.
<EOS>
A
day
or
two
before
the
Indians
were
set
free
(
on
a
Monday
,
I
think
)
,
the
governor
of
the
prison
came
to
me
with
a
letter
.
<EOS>
It
had
been
left
for
the
Indians
by
one
Mrs.
Macann
,
of
whom
they
had
hired
the
lodging
in
which
they
lived
;
and
it
had
been
delivered
at
Mrs.
Macann
's
door
,
in
ordinary
course
of
post
,
on
the
previous
morning
.
<EOS>
The
prison
authorities
had
noticed
that
the
postmark
was
"
Lambeth
,
"
and
that
the
address
on
the
outside
,
though
expressed
in
correct
English
,
was
,
in
form
,
oddly
at
variance
with
the
customary
method
of
directing
a
letter
.
<EOS>
On
opening
it
,
they
had
found
the
contents
to
be
written
in
a
foreign
language
,
which
they
rightly
guessed
at
as
Hindustani
.
<EOS>
Their
object
in
coming
to
me
was
,
of
course
,
to
have
the
letter
translated
to
them
.
<EOS>
I
took
a
copy
in
my
pocket
-
book
of
the
original
,
and
of
my
translation
 
<EOS>
and
there
they
are
at
your
service
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
handed
me
the
open
pocket
-
book
.
<EOS>
The
address
on
the
letter
was
the
first
thing
copied
.
<EOS>
It
was
all
written
in
one
paragraph
,
without
any
attempt
at
punctuation
,
thus
:
"
To
the
three
Indian
men
living
with
the
lady
called
Macann
at
Frizinghall
in
Yorkshire
.
"
<EOS>
The
Hindoo
characters
followed
;
and
the
English
translation
appeared
at
the
end
,
expressed
in
these
mysterious
words
:
  
"
<EOS>
In
the
name
of
the
Regent
of
the
Night
,
whose
seat
is
on
the
Antelope
,
whose
arms
embrace
the
four
corners
of
the
earth
.
  
<EOS>
"
Brothers
,
turn
your
faces
to
the
south
,
and
come
to
me
in
the
street
of
many
noises
,
which
leads
down
to
the
muddy
river
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
reason
is
this
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
own
eyes
have
seen
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
There
the
letter
ended
,
without
either
date
or
signature
.
<EOS>
I
handed
it
back
to
Mr.
Murthwaite
,
and
owned
that
this
curious
specimen
of
Hindoo
correspondence
rather
puzzled
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
explain
the
first
sentence
to
you
,
"
he
said
;
"
and
the
conduct
of
the
Indians
themselves
will
explain
the
rest
.
<EOS>
The
god
of
the
moon
is
represented
,
in
the
Hindoo
mythology
,
as
a
four
-
armed
deity
,
seated
on
an
antelope
;
and
one
of
his
titles
is
the
regent
of
the
night
.
<EOS>
Here
,
then
,
to
begin
with
,
is
something
which
looks
suspiciously
like
an
indirect
reference
to
the
Moonstone
.
<EOS>
Now
,
let
us
see
what
the
Indians
did
,
after
the
prison
authorities
had
allowed
them
to
receive
their
letter
.
<EOS>
On
the
very
day
when
they
were
set
free
they
went
at
once
to
the
railway
station
,
and
took
their
places
in
the
first
train
that
started
for
London
.
<EOS>
We
all
thought
it
a
pity
at
Frizinghall
that
their
proceedings
were
not
privately
watched
.
<EOS>
But
,
after
Lady
Verinder
had
dismissed
the
police
-
officer
,
and
had
stopped
all
further
inquiry
into
the
loss
of
the
Diamond
,
no
one
else
could
presume
to
stir
in
the
matter
.
<EOS>
The
Indians
were
free
to
go
to
London
,
and
to
London
they
went
.
<EOS>
What
was
the
next
news
we
heard
of
them
,
Mr.
Bruff
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
were
annoying
Mr.
Luker
,
"
I
answered
,
"
by
loitering
about
the
house
at
Lambeth
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
you
read
the
report
of
Mr.
Luker
's
application
to
the
magistrate
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
In
the
course
of
his
statement
he
referred
,
if
you
remember
,
to
a
foreign
workman
in
his
employment
,
whom
he
had
just
dismissed
on
suspicion
of
attempted
theft
,
and
whom
he
also
distrusted
as
possibly
acting
in
collusion
with
the
Indians
who
had
annoyed
him
.
<EOS>
The
inference
is
pretty
plain
,
Mr.
Bruff
,
as
to
who
wrote
that
letter
which
puzzled
you
just
now
,
and
as
to
which
of
Mr.
Luker
's
Oriental
treasures
the
workman
had
attempted
to
steal
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
inference
(
as
I
hastened
to
acknowledge
)
was
too
plain
to
need
being
pointed
out
.
<EOS>
I
had
never
doubted
that
the
Moonstone
had
found
its
way
into
Mr.
Luker
's
hands
,
at
the
time
Mr.
Murthwaite
alluded
to
.
<EOS>
My
only
question
had
been
,
How
had
the
Indians
discovered
the
circumstance
?
<EOS>
This
question
(
the
most
difficult
to
deal
with
of
all
,
as
I
had
thought
)
had
now
received
its
answer
,
like
the
rest
.
<EOS>
Lawyer
as
I
was
,
I
began
to
feel
that
I
might
trust
Mr.
Murthwaite
to
lead
me
blindfold
through
the
last
windings
of
the
labyrinth
,
along
which
he
had
guided
me
thus
far
.
<EOS>
I
paid
him
the
compliment
of
telling
him
this
,
and
found
my
little
concession
very
graciously
received
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
shall
give
me
a
piece
of
information
in
your
turn
before
we
go
on
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
Somebody
must
have
taken
the
Moonstone
from
Yorkshire
to
London
.
<EOS>
And
somebody
must
have
raised
money
on
it
,
or
it
would
never
have
been
in
Mr.
Luker
's
possession
.
<EOS>
Has
there
been
any
discovery
made
of
who
that
person
was
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
None
that
I
know
of
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
was
a
story
(
was
there
not
?
)
<EOS>
about
Mr.
Godfrey
Ablewhite
.
<EOS>
I
am
told
he
is
an
eminent
philanthropist
 
which
is
decidedly
against
him
,
to
begin
with
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
heartily
agreed
in
this
with
Mr.
Murthwaite
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
,
I
felt
bound
to
inform
him
(
without
,
it
is
needless
to
say
,
mentioning
Miss
Verinder
's
name
)
that
Mr.
Godfrey
Ablewhite
had
been
cleared
of
all
suspicion
,
on
evidence
which
I
could
answer
for
as
entirely
beyond
dispute
.
  
<EOS>
"
Very
well
,
"
said
Mr.
Murthwaite
,
quietly
,
"
let
us
leave
it
to
time
to
clear
the
matter
up
.
<EOS>
In
the
meanwhile
,
Mr.
Bruff
,
we
must
get
back
again
to
the
Indians
,
on
your
account
.
<EOS>
Their
journey
to
London
simply
ended
in
their
becoming
the
victims
of
another
defeat
.
<EOS>
The
loss
of
their
second
chance
of
seizing
the
Diamond
is
mainly
attributable
,
as
I
think
,
to
the
cunning
and
foresight
of
Mr.
Luker
 
who
does
n't
stand
at
the
top
of
the
prosperous
and
ancient
profession
of
usury
for
nothing
!
<EOS>
By
the
prompt
dismissal
of
the
man
in
his
employment
,
he
deprived
the
Indians
of
the
assistance
which
their
confederate
would
have
rendered
them
in
getting
into
the
house
.
<EOS>
By
the
prompt
transport
of
the
Moonstone
to
his
banker
's
,
he
took
the
conspirators
by
surprise
before
they
were
prepared
with
a
new
plan
for
robbing
him
.
<EOS>
How
the
Indians
,
in
this
latter
case
,
suspected
what
he
had
done
,
and
how
they
contrived
to
possess
themselves
of
his
banker
's
receipt
,
are
events
too
recent
to
need
dwelling
on
.
<EOS>
Let
it
be
enough
to
say
that
they
know
the
Moonstone
to
be
once
more
out
of
their
reach
;
deposited
(
under
the
general
description
of
"
a
valuable
of
great
price
"
)
in
a
banker
's
strong
room
.
<EOS>
Now
,
Mr.
Bruff
,
what
is
their
third
chance
of
seizing
the
Diamond
?
<EOS>
and
when
will
it
come
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
As
the
question
passed
his
lips
,
I
penetrated
the
motive
of
the
Indian
's
visit
to
my
office
at
last
!
  
<EOS>
"
I
see
it
!
"
<EOS>
I
exclaimed
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
Indians
take
it
for
granted
,
as
we
do
,
that
the
Moonstone
has
been
pledged
;
and
they
want
to
be
certainly
informed
of
the
earliest
period
at
which
the
pledge
can
be
redeemed
 
because
that
will
be
the
earliest
period
at
which
the
Diamond
can
be
removed
from
the
safe
keeping
of
the
bank
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
told
you
you
would
find
it
out
for
yourself
,
Mr.
Bruff
,
if
I
only
gave
you
a
fair
chance
.
<EOS>
In
a
year
from
the
time
when
the
Moonstone
was
pledged
,
the
Indians
will
be
on
the
watch
for
their
third
chance
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Luker
's
own
lips
have
told
them
how
long
they
will
have
to
wait
,
and
your
respectable
authority
has
satisfied
them
that
Mr.
Luker
has
spoken
the
truth
.
<EOS>
When
do
we
suppose
,
at
a
rough
guess
,
that
the
Diamond
found
its
way
into
the
money
-
lender
's
hands
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Towards
the
end
of
last
June
,
"
I
answered
,
"
as
well
as
I
can
reckon
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
we
are
now
in
the
year
"
forty
-
eight
.
<EOS>
Very
good
.
<EOS>
If
the
unknown
person
who
has
pledged
the
Moonstone
can
redeem
it
in
a
year
,
the
jewel
will
be
in
that
person
's
possession
again
at
the
end
of
June
,
"
forty
-
nine
.
<EOS>
I
shall
be
thousands
of
miles
from
England
and
English
news
at
that
date
.
<EOS>
But
it
may
be
worth
YOUR
while
to
take
a
note
of
it
,
and
to
arrange
to
be
in
London
at
the
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
think
something
serious
will
happen
?
<EOS>
"
I
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
shall
be
safer
,
"
he
answered
,
"
among
the
fiercest
fanatics
of
Central
Asia
than
I
should
be
if
I
crossed
the
door
of
the
bank
with
the
Moonstone
in
my
pocket
.
<EOS>
The
Indians
have
been
defeated
twice
running
,
Mr.
Bruff
.
<EOS>
It
's
my
firm
belief
that
they
wo
n't
be
defeated
a
third
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Those
were
the
last
words
he
said
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
The
coffee
came
in
;
the
guests
rose
,
and
dispersed
themselves
about
the
room
;
and
we
joined
the
ladies
of
the
dinner
-
party
upstairs
.
  
<EOS>
I
made
a
note
of
the
date
,
and
it
may
not
be
amiss
if
I
close
my
narrative
by
repeating
that
note
here
:
  
JUNE
,
"
FORTY
-
NINE
.
<EOS>
EXPECT
NEWS
OF
THE
INDIANS
,
<EOS>
TOWARDS
<EOS>
THE
END
OF
THE
MONTH
.
  
<EOS>
And
that
done
,
I
hand
the
pen
,
which
I
have
now
no
further
claim
to
use
,
to
the
writer
who
follows
me
next
.
  
<EOS>
THIRD
NARRATIVE
  
<EOS>
Contributed
by
FRANKLIN
BLAKE
    
<EOS>
In
the
spring
of
the
year
eighteen
hundred
and
forty
-
nine
I
was
wandering
in
the
East
,
and
had
then
recently
altered
the
travelling
plans
which
I
had
laid
out
some
months
before
,
and
which
I
had
communicated
to
my
lawyer
and
my
banker
in
London
.
  
<EOS>
This
change
made
it
necessary
for
me
to
send
one
of
my
servants
to
obtain
my
letters
and
remittances
from
the
English
consul
in
a
certain
city
,
which
was
no
longer
included
as
one
of
my
resting
-
places
in
my
new
travelling
scheme
.
<EOS>
The
man
was
to
join
me
again
at
an
appointed
place
and
time
.
<EOS>
An
accident
,
for
which
he
was
not
responsible
,
delayed
him
on
his
errand
.
<EOS>
For
a
week
I
and
my
people
waited
,
encamped
on
the
borders
of
a
desert
.
<EOS>
At
the
end
of
that
time
the
missing
man
made
his
appearance
,
with
the
money
and
the
letters
,
at
the
entrance
of
my
tent
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
afraid
I
bring
you
bad
news
,
sir
,
"
he
said
,
and
pointed
to
one
of
the
letters
,
which
had
a
mourning
border
round
it
,
and
the
address
on
which
was
in
the
handwriting
of
Mr.
Bruff
.
  
<EOS>
I
know
nothing
,
in
a
case
of
this
kind
,
so
unendurable
as
suspense
.
<EOS>
The
letter
with
the
mourning
border
was
the
letter
that
I
opened
first
.
  
<EOS>
It
informed
me
that
my
father
was
dead
,
and
that
I
was
heir
to
his
great
fortune
.
<EOS>
The
wealth
which
had
thus
fallen
into
my
hands
brought
its
responsibilities
with
it
,
and
Mr.
Bruff
entreated
me
to
lose
no
time
in
returning
to
England
.
  
<EOS>
By
daybreak
the
next
morning
,
I
was
on
my
way
back
to
my
own
country
.
  
<EOS>
The
picture
presented
of
me
,
by
my
old
friend
Betteredge
,
at
the
time
of
my
departure
from
England
,
is
(
as
I
think
)
a
little
overdrawn
.
<EOS>
He
has
,
in
his
own
quaint
way
,
interpreted
seriously
one
of
his
young
mistress
's
many
satirical
references
to
my
foreign
education
;
and
has
persuaded
himself
that
he
actually
saw
those
French
,
German
,
and
Italian
sides
to
my
character
,
which
my
lively
cousin
only
professed
to
discover
in
jest
,
and
which
never
had
any
real
existence
,
except
in
our
good
Betteredge
's
own
brain
.
<EOS>
But
,
barring
this
drawback
,
I
am
bound
to
own
that
he
has
stated
no
more
than
the
truth
in
representing
me
as
wounded
to
the
heart
by
Rachel
's
treatment
,
and
as
leaving
England
in
the
first
keenness
of
suffering
caused
by
the
bitterest
disappointment
of
my
life
.
  
<EOS>
I
went
abroad
,
resolved
 
if
change
and
absence
could
help
me
 
to
forget
her
.
<EOS>
It
is
,
I
am
persuaded
,
no
true
view
of
human
nature
which
denies
that
change
and
absence
DO
help
a
man
under
these
circumstances
;
they
force
his
attention
away
from
the
exclusive
contemplation
of
his
own
sorrow
.
<EOS>
I
never
forgot
her
;
but
the
pang
of
remembrance
lost
its
worst
bitterness
,
little
by
little
,
as
time
,
distance
,
and
novelty
interposed
themselves
more
and
more
effectually
between
Rachel
and
me
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
other
hand
,
it
is
no
less
certain
that
,
with
the
act
of
turning
homeward
,
the
remedy
which
had
gained
its
ground
so
steadily
,
began
now
,
just
as
steadily
,
to
drop
back
.
<EOS>
The
nearer
I
drew
to
the
country
which
she
inhabited
,
and
to
the
prospect
of
seeing
her
again
,
the
more
irresistibly
her
influence
began
to
recover
its
hold
on
me
.
<EOS>
On
leaving
England
she
was
the
last
person
in
the
world
whose
name
I
would
have
suffered
to
pass
my
lips
.
<EOS>
On
returning
to
England
,
she
was
the
first
person
I
inquired
after
,
when
Mr.
Bruff
and
I
met
again
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
informed
,
of
course
,
of
all
that
had
happened
in
my
absence
;
in
other
words
,
of
all
that
has
been
related
here
in
continuation
of
Betteredge
's
narrative
 
one
circumstance
only
being
excepted
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bruff
did
not
,
at
that
time
,
feel
himself
at
liberty
to
inform
me
of
the
motives
which
had
privately
influenced
Rachel
and
Godfrey
Ablewhite
in
recalling
the
marriage
promise
,
on
either
side
.
<EOS>
I
troubled
him
with
no
embarrassing
questions
on
this
delicate
subject
.
<EOS>
It
was
relief
enough
to
me
,
after
the
jealous
disappointment
caused
by
hearing
that
she
had
ever
contemplated
being
Godfrey
's
wife
,
to
know
that
reflection
had
convinced
her
of
acting
rashly
,
and
that
she
had
effected
her
own
release
from
her
marriage
engagement
.
  
<EOS>
Having
heard
the
story
of
the
past
,
my
next
inquiries
(
still
inquiries
after
Rachel
!
)
advanced
naturally
to
the
present
time
.
<EOS>
Under
whose
care
had
she
been
placed
after
leaving
Mr.
Bruff
's
house
?
<EOS>
and
where
was
she
living
now
?
  
<EOS>
She
was
living
under
the
care
of
a
widowed
sister
of
the
late
Sir
John
Verinder
 
<EOS>
one
Mrs.
Merridew
 
whom
her
mother
's
executors
had
requested
to
act
as
guardian
,
and
who
had
accepted
the
proposal
.
<EOS>
They
were
reported
to
me
as
getting
on
together
admirably
well
,
and
as
being
now
established
,
for
the
season
,
in
Mrs.
Merridew
's
house
in
Portland
Place
.
  
<EOS>
Half
an
hour
after
receiving
this
information
,
I
was
on
my
way
to
Portland
Place
 
without
having
had
the
courage
to
own
it
to
Mr.
Bruff
!
  
<EOS>
The
man
who
answered
the
door
was
not
sure
whether
Miss
Verinder
was
at
home
or
not
.
<EOS>
I
sent
him
upstairs
with
my
card
,
as
the
speediest
way
of
setting
the
question
at
rest
.
<EOS>
The
man
came
down
again
with
an
impenetrable
face
,
and
informed
me
that
Miss
Verinder
was
out
.
  
<EOS>
I
might
have
suspected
other
people
of
purposely
denying
themselves
to
me
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
impossible
to
suspect
Rachel
.
<EOS>
I
left
word
that
I
would
call
again
at
six
o'clock
that
evening
.
  
<EOS>
At
six
o'clock
I
was
informed
for
the
second
time
that
Miss
Verinder
was
not
at
home
.
<EOS>
Had
any
message
been
left
for
me
.
<EOS>
No
message
had
been
left
for
me
.
<EOS>
Had
Miss
Verinder
not
received
my
card
?
<EOS>
The
servant
begged
my
pardon
 
Miss
Verinder
HAD
received
it
.
  
<EOS>
The
inference
was
too
plain
to
be
resisted
.
<EOS>
Rachel
declined
to
see
me
.
  
<EOS>
On
my
side
,
I
declined
to
be
treated
in
this
way
,
without
making
an
attempt
,
at
least
,
to
discover
a
reason
for
it
.
<EOS>
I
sent
up
my
name
to
Mrs.
Merridew
,
and
requested
her
to
favour
me
with
a
personal
interview
at
any
hour
which
it
might
be
most
convenient
to
her
to
name
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Merridew
made
no
difficulty
about
receiving
me
at
once
.
<EOS>
I
was
shown
into
a
comfortable
little
sitting
-
room
,
and
found
myself
in
the
presence
of
a
comfortable
little
elderly
lady
.
<EOS>
She
was
so
good
as
to
feel
great
regret
and
much
surprise
,
entirely
on
my
account
.
<EOS>
She
was
at
the
same
time
,
however
,
not
in
a
position
to
offer
me
any
explanation
,
or
to
press
Rachel
on
a
matter
which
appeared
to
relate
to
a
question
of
private
feeling
alone
.
<EOS>
This
was
said
over
and
over
again
,
with
a
polite
patience
that
nothing
could
tire
;
and
this
was
all
I
gained
by
applying
to
Mrs.
Merridew
.
  
<EOS>
My
last
chance
was
to
write
to
Rachel
.
<EOS>
My
servant
took
a
letter
to
her
the
next
day
,
with
strict
instructions
to
wait
for
an
answer
.
  
<EOS>
The
answer
came
back
,
literally
in
one
sentence
.
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Verinder
begs
to
decline
entering
into
any
correspondence
with
Mr.
Franklin
Blake
.
"
  
<EOS>
Fond
as
I
was
of
her
<EOS>
,
I
felt
indignantly
the
insult
offered
to
me
in
that
reply
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bruff
came
in
to
speak
to
me
on
business
,
before
I
had
recovered
possession
of
myself
.
<EOS>
I
dismissed
the
business
on
the
spot
,
and
laid
the
whole
case
before
him
.
<EOS>
He
proved
to
be
as
incapable
of
enlightening
me
as
Mrs.
Merridew
herself
.
<EOS>
I
asked
him
if
any
slander
had
been
spoken
of
me
in
Rachel
's
hearing
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bruff
was
not
aware
of
any
slander
of
which
I
was
the
object
.
<EOS>
Had
she
referred
to
me
in
any
way
while
she
was
staying
under
Mr.
Bruff
's
roof
?
<EOS>
Never
.
<EOS>
Had
she
not
so
much
as
asked
,
during
all
my
long
absence
,
whether
I
was
living
or
dead
?
<EOS>
No
such
question
had
ever
passed
her
lips
.
<EOS>
I
took
out
of
my
pocket
-
book
the
letter
which
poor
Lady
Verinder
had
written
to
me
from
Frizinghall
,
on
the
day
when
I
left
her
house
in
Yorkshire
.
<EOS>
And
I
pointed
Mr.
Bruff
's
attention
to
these
two
sentences
in
it
:
  
<EOS>
"
The
valuable
assistance
which
you
rendered
to
the
inquiry
after
the
lost
jewel
is
still
an
unpardoned
offence
,
in
the
present
dreadful
state
of
Rachel
's
mind
.
<EOS>
Moving
blindfold
in
this
matter
,
you
have
added
to
the
burden
of
anxiety
which
she
has
had
to
bear
,
by
innocently
threatening
her
secret
with
discovery
through
your
exertions
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
it
possible
,
"
I
asked
,
"
that
the
feeling
towards
me
which
is
there
described
,
is
as
bitter
as
ever
against
me
now
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Bruff
looked
unaffectedly
distressed
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
insist
on
an
answer
,
"
he
said
,
"
I
own
I
can
place
no
other
interpretation
on
her
conduct
than
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
rang
the
bell
,
and
directed
my
servant
to
pack
my
portmanteau
,
and
to
send
out
for
a
railway
guide
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bruff
asked
,
in
astonishment
,
what
I
was
going
to
do
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
going
to
Yorkshire
,
"
I
answered
,
"
by
the
next
train
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
May
I
ask
for
what
purpose
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Bruff
,
the
assistance
I
innocently
rendered
to
the
inquiry
after
the
Diamond
was
an
unpardoned
offence
,
in
Rachel
's
mind
,
nearly
a
year
since
;
and
it
remains
an
unpardoned
offence
still
.
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
accept
that
position
!
<EOS>
I
am
determined
to
find
out
the
secret
of
her
silence
towards
her
mother
,
and
her
enmity
towards
me
.
<EOS>
If
time
,
pains
,
and
money
can
do
it
,
I
will
lay
my
hand
on
the
thief
who
took
the
Moonstone
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
worthy
old
gentleman
attempted
to
remonstrate
 
to
induce
me
to
listen
to
reason
 
to
do
his
duty
towards
me
,
in
short
.
<EOS>
I
was
deaf
to
everything
that
he
could
urge
.
<EOS>
No
earthly
consideration
would
,
at
that
moment
,
have
shaken
the
resolution
that
was
in
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
take
up
the
inquiry
again
,
"
<EOS>
I
went
on
,
"
at
the
point
where
I
dropped
it
;
and
I
shall
follow
it
onwards
,
step
by
step
,
till
I
come
to
the
present
time
.
<EOS>
There
are
missing
links
in
the
evidence
,
as
I
left
it
,
which
Gabriel
Betteredge
can
supply
,
and
to
Gabriel
Betteredge
I
go
!
"
  
<EOS>
Towards
sunset
that
evening
I
stood
again
on
the
well
-
remembered
terrace
,
and
looked
once
more
at
the
peaceful
old
country
house
.
<EOS>
The
gardener
was
the
first
person
whom
I
saw
in
the
deserted
grounds
.
<EOS>
He
had
left
Betteredge
,
an
hour
since
,
sunning
himself
in
the
customary
corner
of
the
back
yard
.
<EOS>
I
knew
it
well
;
and
I
said
I
would
go
and
seek
him
myself
.
  
<EOS>
I
walked
round
by
the
familiar
paths
and
passages
,
and
looked
in
at
the
open
gate
of
the
yard
.
  
<EOS>
There
he
was
 
the
dear
old
friend
of
the
happy
days
that
were
never
to
come
again
 
<EOS>
there
he
was
in
the
old
corner
,
on
the
old
beehive
chair
,
with
his
pipe
in
his
mouth
,
and
his
ROBINSON
CRUSOE
on
his
lap
,
and
his
two
friends
,
the
dogs
,
dozing
on
either
side
of
him
!
<EOS>
In
the
position
in
which
I
stood
,
my
shadow
was
projected
in
front
of
me
by
the
last
slanting
rays
of
the
sun
.
<EOS>
Either
the
dogs
saw
it
,
or
their
keen
scent
informed
them
of
my
approach
;
they
started
up
with
a
growl
.
<EOS>
Starting
in
his
turn
,
the
old
man
quieted
them
by
a
word
,
and
then
shaded
his
failing
eyes
with
his
hand
,
and
looked
inquiringly
at
the
figure
at
the
gate
.
  
<EOS>
My
own
eyes
were
full
of
tears
.
<EOS>
I
was
obliged
to
wait
a
moment
before
I
could
trust
myself
to
speak
to
him
.
    
<EOS>
"
Betteredge
!
<EOS>
"
I
said
,
pointing
to
the
well
-
remembered
book
on
his
knee
,
"
has
ROBINSON
CRUSOE
informed
you
,
this
evening
,
that
you
might
expect
to
see
Franklin
Blake
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
By
the
lord
Harry
,
Mr.
Franklin
!
<EOS>
"
cried
the
old
man
,
"
that
's
exactly
what
ROBINSON
CRUSOE
has
done
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
struggled
to
his
feet
with
my
assistance
,
and
stood
for
a
moment
,
looking
backwards
and
forwards
between
ROBINSON
CRUSOE
and
me
,
apparently
at
a
loss
to
discover
which
of
us
had
surprised
him
most
.
<EOS>
The
verdict
ended
in
favour
of
the
book
.
<EOS>
Holding
it
open
before
him
in
both
hands
,
he
surveyed
the
wonderful
volume
with
a
stare
of
unutterable
anticipation
 
as
if
he
expected
to
see
Robinson
Crusoe
himself
walk
out
of
the
pages
,
and
favour
us
with
a
personal
interview
.
  
<EOS>
"
Here
's
the
bit
,
Mr.
Franklin
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
as
soon
as
he
had
recovered
the
use
of
his
speech
.
<EOS>
"
As
I
live
by
bread
,
sir
,
here
's
the
bit
I
was
reading
,
the
moment
before
you
came
in
!
<EOS>
Page
one
hundred
and
fifty
-
six
as
follows
:
 
<EOS>
"
I
stood
like
one
Thunderstruck
,
or
as
if
I
had
seen
an
Apparition
.
<EOS>
"
If
that
is
n't
as
much
as
to
say
:
"
Expect
the
sudden
appearance
of
Mr.
Franklin
Blake
"
 
<EOS>
there
's
no
meaning
in
the
English
language
!
"
<EOS>
said
Betteredge
,
closing
the
book
with
a
bang
,
and
getting
one
of
his
hands
free
at
last
to
take
the
hand
which
I
offered
him
.
  
<EOS>
I
had
expected
him
,
naturally
enough
under
the
circumstances
,
to
overwhelm
me
with
questions
.
<EOS>
But
no
 
the
hospitable
impulse
was
the
uppermost
impulse
in
the
old
servant
's
mind
,
when
a
member
of
the
family
appeared
(
no
matter
how
!
)
<EOS>
as
a
visitor
at
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
"
Walk
in
,
Mr.
Franklin
,
"
he
said
,
opening
the
door
behind
him
,
with
his
quaint
old
-
fashioned
bow
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
ask
what
brings
you
here
afterwards
 
<EOS>
I
must
make
you
comfortable
first
.
<EOS>
There
have
been
sad
changes
,
since
you
went
away
.
<EOS>
The
house
is
shut
up
,
and
the
servants
are
gone
.
<EOS>
Never
mind
that
!
<EOS>
I
'll
cook
your
dinner
;
and
the
gardener
's
wife
will
make
your
bed
 
and
if
there
's
a
bottle
of
our
famous
Latour
claret
left
in
the
cellar
,
down
your
throat
,
Mr.
Franklin
,
that
bottle
shall
go
.
<EOS>
I
bid
you
welcome
,
sir
!
<EOS>
I
bid
you
heartily
welcome
!
"
<EOS>
said
the
poor
old
fellow
,
fighting
manfully
against
the
gloom
of
the
deserted
house
,
and
receiving
me
with
the
sociable
and
courteous
attention
of
the
bygone
time
.
  
<EOS>
It
vexed
me
to
disappoint
him
.
<EOS>
But
the
house
was
Rachel
's
house
,
now
.
<EOS>
Could
I
eat
in
it
,
or
sleep
in
it
,
after
what
had
happened
in
London
?
<EOS>
The
commonest
sense
of
self
-
respect
forbade
me
 
properly
forbade
me
 
to
cross
the
threshold
.
  
<EOS>
I
took
Betteredge
by
the
arm
,
and
led
him
out
into
the
garden
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
help
for
it
.
<EOS>
I
was
obliged
to
tell
him
the
truth
.
<EOS>
Between
his
attachment
to
Rachel
,
and
his
attachment
to
me
,
he
was
sorely
puzzled
and
distressed
at
the
turn
things
had
taken
.
<EOS>
His
opinion
,
when
he
expressed
it
,
was
given
in
his
usual
downright
manner
,
and
was
agreeably
redolent
of
the
most
positive
philosophy
<EOS>
I
know
 
<EOS>
the
philosophy
of
the
Betteredge
school
.
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Rachel
has
her
faults
 
<EOS>
I
've
never
denied
it
,
"
he
began
.
"
<EOS>
And
riding
the
high
horse
,
now
and
then
,
is
one
of
them
.
<EOS>
She
has
been
trying
to
ride
over
you
 
<EOS>
and
you
have
put
up
with
it
.
<EOS>
Lord
,
Mr.
Franklin
,
do
n't
you
know
women
by
this
time
better
than
that
?
<EOS>
You
have
heard
me
talk
of
the
late
Mrs.
Betteredge
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
had
heard
him
talk
of
the
late
Mrs.
Betteredge
pretty
often
 
invariably
producing
her
as
his
one
undeniable
example
of
the
inbred
frailty
and
perversity
of
the
other
sex
.
<EOS>
In
that
capacity
he
exhibited
her
now
.
  
<EOS>
"
Very
well
,
Mr.
Franklin
.
<EOS>
Now
listen
to
me
.
<EOS>
Different
women
have
different
ways
of
riding
the
high
horse
.
<EOS>
The
late
Mrs.
Betteredge
took
her
exercise
on
that
favourite
female
animal
whenever
I
happened
to
deny
her
anything
that
she
had
set
her
heart
on
.
<EOS>
So
sure
as
I
came
home
from
my
work
on
these
occasions
,
so
sure
was
my
wife
to
call
to
me
up
the
kitchen
stairs
,
and
to
say
that
,
after
my
brutal
treatment
of
her
,
she
had
n't
the
heart
to
cook
me
my
dinner
.
<EOS>
I
put
up
with
it
for
some
time
 
just
as
you
are
putting
up
with
it
now
from
Miss
Rachel
.
<EOS>
At
last
my
patience
wore
out
.
<EOS>
I
went
downstairs
,
and
I
took
Mrs.
Betteredge
 
affectionately
<EOS>
,
you
understand
 
up
in
my
arms
,
and
carried
her
,
holus
-
bolus
,
into
the
best
parlour
where
she
received
her
company
.
<EOS>
I
said
"
That
's
the
right
place
for
you
,
my
dear
,
"
and
so
went
back
to
the
kitchen
.
<EOS>
I
locked
myself
in
,
and
took
off
my
coat
,
and
turned
up
my
shirt
-
sleeves
,
and
cooked
my
own
dinner
.
<EOS>
When
it
was
done
,
I
served
it
up
in
my
best
manner
,
and
enjoyed
it
most
heartily
.
<EOS>
I
had
my
pipe
and
my
drop
of
grog
afterwards
;
and
then
I
cleared
the
table
,
and
washed
the
crockery
,
and
cleaned
the
knives
and
forks
,
and
put
the
things
away
,
and
swept
up
the
hearth
.
<EOS>
When
things
were
as
bright
and
clean
again
,
as
bright
and
clean
could
be
,
I
opened
the
door
and
let
Mrs.
Betteredge
in
.
<EOS>
"
I
've
had
my
dinner
,
my
dear
,
"
I
said
;
"
<EOS>
and
I
hope
you
will
find
that
I
have
left
the
kitchen
all
that
your
fondest
wishes
can
desire
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
For
the
rest
of
that
woman
's
life
,
Mr.
Franklin
,
I
never
had
to
cook
my
dinner
again
!
<EOS>
Moral
:
You
have
put
up
with
Miss
Rachel
in
London
;
do
n't
put
up
with
her
in
Yorkshire
.
<EOS>
Come
back
to
the
house
!
"
  
<EOS>
Quite
unanswerable
!
<EOS>
I
could
only
assure
my
good
friend
that
even
HIS
powers
of
persuasion
were
,
in
this
case
,
thrown
away
on
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
lovely
evening
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
walk
to
Frizinghall
,
and
stay
at
the
hotel
,
and
you
must
come
to
-
morrow
morning
and
breakfast
with
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
something
to
say
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Betteredge
shook
his
head
gravely
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
heartily
sorry
for
this
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
had
hoped
,
Mr.
Franklin
,
to
hear
that
things
were
all
smooth
and
pleasant
again
between
you
and
Miss
Rachel
.
<EOS>
If
you
must
have
your
own
way
,
sir
,
"
he
continued
,
after
a
moment
's
reflection
,
"
there
is
no
need
to
go
to
Frizinghall
to
-
night
for
a
bed
.
<EOS>
It
's
to
be
had
nearer
than
that
.
<EOS>
There
's
Hotherstone
's
Farm
,
barely
two
miles
from
here
.
<EOS>
You
can
hardly
object
to
THAT
on
Miss
Rachel
's
account
,
"
the
old
man
added
slily
.
"
<EOS>
Hotherstone
lives
,
Mr.
Franklin
,
on
his
own
freehold
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
remembered
the
place
the
moment
Betteredge
mentioned
it
.
<EOS>
The
farm
-
house
stood
in
a
sheltered
inland
valley
,
on
the
banks
of
the
prettiest
stream
in
that
part
of
Yorkshire
:
and
the
farmer
had
a
spare
bedroom
and
parlour
,
which
he
was
accustomed
to
let
to
artists
,
anglers
,
and
tourists
in
general
.
<EOS>
A
more
agreeable
place
of
abode
,
during
my
stay
in
the
neighbourhood
,
I
could
not
have
wished
to
find
.
  
<EOS>
"
Are
the
rooms
to
let
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquired
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Hotherstone
herself
,
sir
,
asked
for
my
good
word
to
recommend
the
rooms
,
yesterday
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
take
them
,
Betteredge
,
with
the
greatest
pleasure
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
We
went
back
to
the
yard
,
in
which
I
had
left
my
travelling
-
bag
.
<EOS>
After
putting
a
stick
through
the
handle
,
and
swinging
the
bag
over
his
shoulder
,
Betteredge
appeared
to
relapse
into
the
bewilderment
which
my
sudden
appearance
had
caused
,
when
I
surprised
him
in
the
beehive
chair
.
<EOS>
He
looked
incredulously
at
the
house
,
and
then
he
wheeled
about
,
and
looked
more
incredulously
still
at
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
've
lived
a
goodish
long
time
in
the
world
,
"
said
this
best
and
dearest
of
all
old
servants
 
"
but
the
like
of
this
,
I
never
did
expect
to
see
.
<EOS>
There
stands
the
house
,
and
here
stands
Mr.
Franklin
Blake
 
and
,
Damme
,
if
one
of
them
is
n't
turning
his
back
on
the
other
,
and
going
to
sleep
in
a
lodging
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
led
the
way
out
,
wagging
his
head
and
growling
ominously
.
<EOS>
"
There
's
only
one
more
miracle
that
CAN
happen
,
"
he
said
to
me
,
over
his
shoulder
.
<EOS>
"
The
next
thing
you
'll
do
,
Mr.
Franklin
,
will
be
to
pay
me
back
that
seven
-
and
-
sixpence
you
borrowed
of
me
when
you
were
a
boy
.
"
  
<EOS>
This
stroke
of
sarcasm
put
him
in
a
better
humour
with
himself
and
with
me
.
<EOS>
We
left
the
house
,
and
passed
through
the
lodge
gates
.
<EOS>
Once
clear
of
the
grounds
,
the
duties
of
hospitality
(
in
Betteredge
's
code
of
morals
)
ceased
,
and
the
privileges
of
curiosity
began
.
  
<EOS>
He
dropped
back
,
so
as
to
let
me
get
on
a
level
with
him
.
"
<EOS>
Fine
evening
for
a
walk
,
Mr.
Franklin
<EOS>
,
"
he
said
,
as
if
we
had
just
accidentally
encountered
each
other
at
that
moment
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Supposing
you
had
gone
to
the
hotel
at
Frizinghall
,
sir
?
"
  
"
Yes
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
have
had
the
honour
of
breakfasting
with
you
,
to
-
morrow
morning
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Come
and
breakfast
with
me
at
Hotherstone
's
Farm
,
instead
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Much
obliged
to
you
for
your
kindness
,
Mr.
Franklin
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
n't
exactly
breakfast
that
I
was
driving
at
.
<EOS>
I
think
you
mentioned
that
you
had
something
to
say
to
me
?
<EOS>
If
it
's
no
secret
,
sir
,
"
said
Betteredge
,
suddenly
abandoning
the
crooked
way
,
and
taking
the
straight
one
,
"
I
'm
burning
to
know
what
's
brought
you
down
here
,
if
you
please
,
in
this
sudden
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
brought
me
here
before
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
Moonstone
,
Mr.
Franklin
.
<EOS>
But
what
brings
you
now
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
Moonstone
again
,
Betteredge
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
old
man
suddenly
stood
still
,
and
looked
at
me
in
the
grey
twilight
as
if
he
suspected
his
own
ears
of
deceiving
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
that
's
a
joke
,
sir
,
"
he
said
,
"
I
'm
afraid
I
'm
getting
a
little
dull
in
my
old
age
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
take
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
no
joke
,
"
I
answered
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
come
here
to
take
up
the
inquiry
which
was
dropped
when
I
left
England
.
<EOS>
I
have
come
here
to
do
what
nobody
has
done
yet
 
to
find
out
who
took
the
Diamond
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Let
the
Diamond
be
,
Mr.
Franklin
!
<EOS>
Take
my
advice
,
and
let
the
Diamond
be
!
<EOS>
That
cursed
Indian
jewel
has
misguided
everybody
who
has
come
near
it
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
waste
your
money
and
your
temper
 
in
the
fine
spring
time
of
your
life
,
sir
 
by
meddling
with
the
Moonstone
.
<EOS>
How
can
YOU
hope
to
succeed
(
saving
your
presence
)
,
when
Sergeant
Cuff
himself
made
a
mess
of
it
?
<EOS>
Sergeant
Cuff
!
"
<EOS>
repeated
Betteredge
,
shaking
his
forefinger
at
me
sternly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
greatest
policeman
in
England
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
mind
is
made
up
,
my
old
friend
.
<EOS>
Even
Sergeant
Cuff
does
n't
daunt
me
.
<EOS>
By
-
the
-
bye
,
I
may
want
to
speak
to
him
,
sooner
or
later
.
<EOS>
Have
you
heard
anything
of
him
lately
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
Sergeant
wo
n't
help
you
,
Mr.
Franklin
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
not
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
has
been
an
event
,
sir
,
in
the
police
-
circles
,
since
you
went
away
.
<EOS>
The
great
Cuff
has
retired
from
business
.
<EOS>
He
has
got
a
little
cottage
at
Dorking
;
and
he
's
up
to
his
eyes
in
the
growing
of
roses
.
<EOS>
I
have
it
in
his
own
handwriting
,
Mr.
Franklin
.
<EOS>
He
has
grown
the
white
moss
rose
,
without
budding
it
on
the
dog
-
rose
first
.
<EOS>
And
Mr.
Begbie
the
gardener
is
to
go
to
Dorking
,
and
own
that
the
Sergeant
has
beaten
him
at
last
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
does
n't
much
matter
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
do
without
Sergeant
Cuff
's
help
.
<EOS>
And
I
must
trust
to
you
,
at
starting
.
"
  
<EOS>
It
is
likely
enough
that
I
spoke
rather
carelessly
.
  
<EOS>
At
any
rate
,
Betteredge
seemed
to
be
piqued
by
something
in
the
reply
which
I
had
just
made
to
him
.
<EOS>
"
You
might
trust
to
worse
than
me
,
Mr.
Franklin
 
<EOS>
I
can
tell
you
that
,
"
he
said
a
little
sharply
.
  
<EOS>
The
tone
in
which
he
retorted
,
and
a
certain
disturbance
,
after
he
had
spoken
,
which
I
detected
in
his
manner
,
suggested
to
me
that
he
was
possessed
of
some
information
which
he
hesitated
to
communicate
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
expect
you
to
help
me
,
"
I
said
,
"
in
picking
up
the
fragments
of
evidence
which
Sergeant
Cuff
has
left
behind
him
.
<EOS>
I
know
you
can
do
that
.
<EOS>
Can
you
do
no
more
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
more
can
you
expect
from
me
,
sir
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Betteredge
,
with
an
appearance
of
the
utmost
humility
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
expect
more
 
from
what
you
said
just
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mere
boasting
,
Mr.
Franklin
,
"
returned
the
old
man
obstinately
.
<EOS>
"
Some
people
are
born
boasters
,
and
they
never
get
over
it
to
their
dying
day
.
<EOS>
I
'm
one
of
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
only
one
way
to
take
with
him
.
<EOS>
I
appealed
to
his
interest
in
Rachel
,
and
his
interest
in
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
Betteredge
,
would
you
be
glad
to
hear
that
Rachel
and
I
were
good
friends
again
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
served
your
family
,
sir
,
to
mighty
little
purpose
,
if
you
doubt
it
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
remember
how
Rachel
treated
me
,
before
I
left
England
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
As
well
as
if
it
was
yesterday
!
<EOS>
My
lady
herself
wrote
you
a
letter
about
it
;
and
you
were
so
good
as
to
show
the
letter
to
me
.
<EOS>
It
said
that
Miss
Rachel
was
mortally
offended
with
you
,
for
the
part
you
had
taken
in
trying
to
recover
her
jewel
.
<EOS>
And
neither
my
lady
,
nor
you
,
nor
anybody
else
could
guess
why
.
  
<EOS>
"
Quite
true
,
Betteredge
!
<EOS>
And
I
come
back
from
my
travels
,
and
find
her
mortally
offended
with
me
still
.
<EOS>
I
knew
that
the
Diamond
was
at
the
bottom
of
it
,
last
year
,
and
I
know
that
the
Diamond
is
at
the
bottom
of
it
now
.
<EOS>
I
have
tried
to
speak
to
her
,
and
she
wo
n't
see
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
tried
to
write
to
her
,
and
she
wo
n't
answer
me
.
<EOS>
How
,
in
Heaven
's
name
,
am
I
to
clear
the
matter
up
?
<EOS>
The
chance
of
searching
into
the
loss
of
the
Moonstone
,
is
the
one
chance
of
inquiry
that
Rachel
herself
has
left
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Those
words
evidently
put
the
case
before
him
,
as
he
had
not
seen
it
yet
.
<EOS>
He
asked
a
question
which
satisfied
me
that
I
had
shaken
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
no
ill
-
feeling
in
this
,
Mr.
Franklin
,
on
your
side
 
is
there
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
was
some
anger
,
"
I
answered
,
"
when
I
left
London
.
<EOS>
But
that
is
all
worn
out
now
.
<EOS>
I
want
to
make
Rachel
come
to
an
understanding
with
me
 
<EOS>
and
I
want
nothing
more
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
feel
any
fear
,
<EOS>
sir
 
supposing
you
make
any
discoveries
 
in
regard
to
what
you
may
find
out
about
Miss
Rachel
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
understood
the
jealous
belief
in
his
young
mistress
which
prompted
those
words
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
as
certain
of
her
as
you
are
,
"
I
answered
.
<EOS>
"
The
fullest
disclosure
of
her
secret
will
reveal
nothing
that
can
alter
her
place
in
your
estimation
,
or
in
mine
.
"
  
<EOS>
Betteredge
's
last
-
left
scruples
vanished
at
that
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
am
doing
wrong
to
help
you
,
Mr.
Franklin
,
"
he
exclaimed
,
"
<EOS>
all
I
can
say
is
 
I
am
as
innocent
of
seeing
it
as
the
babe
unborn
!
<EOS>
I
can
put
you
on
the
road
to
discovery
,
if
you
can
only
go
on
by
yourself
.
<EOS>
You
remember
that
poor
girl
of
ours
 
Rosanna
Spearman
?
"
  
"
Of
course
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
always
thought
she
had
some
sort
of
confession
in
regard
to
this
matter
of
the
Moonstone
,
which
she
wanted
to
make
to
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
certainly
could
n't
account
for
her
strange
conduct
in
any
other
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
may
set
that
doubt
at
rest
,
Mr.
Franklin
,
whenever
you
please
.
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
my
turn
to
come
to
a
standstill
now
.
<EOS>
I
tried
vainly
,
in
the
gathering
darkness
,
to
see
his
face
.
<EOS>
In
the
surprise
of
the
moment
,
I
asked
a
little
impatiently
what
he
meant
.
  
<EOS>
"
Steady
,
sir
!
"
proceeded
Betteredge
.
<EOS>
"
I
mean
what
I
say
.
<EOS>
Rosanna
Spearman
left
a
sealed
letter
behind
her
 
a
letter
addressed
to
YOU
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Where
is
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
In
the
possession
of
a
friend
of
hers
,
at
Cobb
's
Hole
.
<EOS>
You
must
have
heard
tell
,
when
you
were
here
last
,
sir
,
of
Limping
Lucy
 
a
lame
girl
with
a
crutch
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
fisherman
's
daughter
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
same
,
Mr.
Franklin
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
was
n't
the
letter
forwarded
to
me
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Limping
Lucy
has
a
will
of
her
own

<EOS>
She
would
n't
give
it
into
any
hands
but
yours
.
<EOS>
And
you
had
left
England
before
I
could
write
to
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Let
's
go
back
,
Betteredge
,
and
get
it
at
once
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Too
late
,
sir
,
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
They
're
great
savers
of
candles
along
our
coast
;
and
they
go
to
bed
early
at
Cobb
's
Hole
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nonsense
!
<EOS>
We
might
get
there
in
half
an
hour
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
might
,
sir
.
<EOS>
And
when
you
did
get
there
,
you
would
find
the
door
locked
.
<EOS>
He
pointed
to
a
light
,
glimmering
below
us
;
and
,
at
the
same
moment
,
I
heard
through
the
stillness
of
the
evening
the
bubbling
of
a
stream
.
<EOS>
"
There
's
the
Farm
,
Mr.
Franklin
!
<EOS>
Make
yourself
comfortable
for
to
-
night
,
and
come
to
me
to
-
morrow
morning
if
you
'll
be
so
kind
?
"
<EOS>
"
  
"
You
will
go
with
me
to
the
fisherman
's
cottage
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
sir
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Early
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
As
early
,
Mr.
Franklin
,
as
you
like
.
"
  
<EOS>
We
descended
the
path
that
led
to
the
Farm
.
    
<EOS>
I
have
only
the
most
indistinct
recollection
of
what
happened
at
Hotherstone
's
Farm
.
  
<EOS>
I
remember
a
hearty
welcome
;
a
prodigious
supper
,
which
would
have
fed
a
whole
village
in
the
East
;
a
delightfully
clean
bedroom
,
with
nothing
in
it
to
regret
but
that
detestable
product
of
the
folly
of
our
fore
-
fathers
 
a
feather
-
bed
;
a
restless
night
,
with
much
kindling
of
matches
,
and
many
lightings
of
one
little
candle
;
and
an
immense
sensation
of
relief
when
the
sun
rose
,
and
there
was
a
prospect
of
getting
up
.
  
<EOS>
It
had
been
arranged
over
-
night
with
Betteredge
,
that
I
was
to
call
for
him
,
on
our
way
to
Cobb
's
Hole
,
as
early
as
I
liked
 
which
,
interpreted
by
my
impatience
to
get
possession
of
the
letter
,
meant
as
early
as
I
could
.
<EOS>
Without
waiting
for
breakfast
at
the
Farm
,
I
took
a
crust
of
bread
in
my
hand
,
and
set
forth
,
in
some
doubt
whether
I
should
not
surprise
the
excellent
Betteredge
in
his
bed
.
<EOS>
To
my
great
relief
he
proved
to
be
quite
as
excited
about
the
coming
event
as
I
was
.
<EOS>
I
found
him
ready
,
and
waiting
for
me
,
with
his
stick
in
his
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
are
you
this
morning
,
Betteredge
?
"
  
"
Very
poorly
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sorry
to
hear
it
.
<EOS>
What
do
you
complain
of
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
complain
of
a
new
disease
,
Mr.
Franklin
,
of
my
own
inventing
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
want
to
alarm
you
,
but
you
're
certain
to
catch
it
before
the
morning
is
out
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
devil
I
am
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
feel
an
uncomfortable
heat
at
the
pit
of
your
stomach
,
sir
?
<EOS>
and
a
nasty
thumping
at
the
top
of
your
head
?
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
not
yet
?
<EOS>
It
will
lay
hold
of
you
at
Cobb
's
Hole
,
Mr.
Franklin
.
<EOS>
I
call
it
the
detective
-
fever
;
and
I
first
caught
it
in
the
company
of
Sergeant
Cuff
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Aye
!
aye
!
<EOS>
and
the
cure
in
this
instance
is
to
open
Rosanna
Spearman
's
letter
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
Come
along
,
and
let
's
get
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Early
as
it
was
,
we
found
the
fisherman
's
wife
astir
in
her
kitchen
.
<EOS>
On
my
presentation
by
Betteredge
,
good
Mrs.
Yolland
performed
a
social
ceremony
,
strictly
reserved
(
as
I
afterwards
learnt
)
for
strangers
of
distinction
.
<EOS>
She
put
a
bottle
of
Dutch
gin
and
a
couple
of
clean
pipes
on
the
table
,
and
opened
the
conversation
by
saying
,
"
What
news
from
London
,
sir
?
"
  
<EOS>
Before
I
could
find
an
answer
to
this
immensely
comprehensive
question
,
an
apparition
advanced
towards
me
,
out
of
a
dark
corner
of
the
kitchen
.
<EOS>
A
wan
,
wild
,
haggard
girl
,
with
remarkably
beautiful
hair
,
and
with
a
fierce
keenness
in
her
eyes
,
came
limping
up
on
a
crutch
to
the
table
at
which
I
was
sitting
,
and
looked
at
me
as
if
I
was
an
object
of
mingled
interest
and
horror
,
which
it
quite
fascinated
her
to
see
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Betteredge
,
"
she
said
,
without
taking
her
eyes
off
me
,
"
mention
his
name
again
,
if
you
please
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
This
gentleman
's
name
,
"
answered
Betteredge
(
with
a
strong
emphasis
on
GENTLEMAN
)
,
"
is
Mr.
Franklin
Blake
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
girl
turned
her
back
on
me
,
and
suddenly
left
the
room
.
<EOS>
Good
Mrs.
Yolland
 
as
I
believe
 
made
some
apologies
for
her
daughter
's
odd
behaviour
,
and
Betteredge
(
probably
)
translated
them
into
polite
English
.
<EOS>
I
speak
of
this
in
complete
uncertainty
.
<EOS>
My
attention
was
absorbed
in
following
the
sound
of
the
girl
's
crutch
.
<EOS>
Thump
-
thump
,
up
the
wooden
stairs
;
thump
-
thump
across
the
room
above
our
heads
;
thump
-
thump
down
the
stairs
again
 
<EOS>
and
there
stood
the
apparition
at
the
open
door
,
with
a
letter
in
its
hand
,
beckoning
me
out
!
  
<EOS>
I
left
more
apologies
in
course
of
delivery
behind
me
,
and
followed
this
strange
creature
 
limping
on
before
me
,
faster
and
faster
 
down
the
slope
of
the
beach
.
<EOS>
She
led
me
behind
some
boats
,
out
of
sight
and
hearing
of
the
few
people
in
the
fishing
-
village
,
and
then
stopped
,
and
faced
me
for
the
first
time
.
  
<EOS>
"
Stand
there
,
"
she
said
,
"
I
want
to
look
at
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
no
mistaking
the
expression
on
her
face
.
<EOS>
I
inspired
her
with
the
strongest
emotions
of
abhorrence
and
disgust
.
<EOS>
Let
me
not
be
vain
enough
to
say
that
no
woman
had
ever
looked
at
me
in
this
manner
before
.
<EOS>
I
will
only
venture
on
the
more
modest
assertion
that
no
woman
had
ever
let
me
perceive
it
yet
.
<EOS>
There
is
a
limit
to
the
length
of
the
inspection
which
a
man
can
endure
,
under
certain
circumstances
.
<EOS>
I
attempted
to
direct
Limping
Lucy
's
attention
to
some
less
revolting
object
than
my
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
have
got
a
letter
to
give
me
,
"
I
began
.
<EOS>
"
Is
it
the
letter
there
,
in
your
hand
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Say
that
again
,
"
was
the
only
answer
I
received
.
  
<EOS>
I
repeated
the
words
,
like
a
good
child
learning
its
lesson
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
the
girl
,
speaking
to
herself
,
but
keeping
her
eyes
still
mercilessly
fixed
on
me
.
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
find
out
what
she
saw
in
his
face
.
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
guess
what
she
heard
in
his
voice
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
suddenly
looked
away
from
me
,
and
rested
her
head
wearily
on
the
top
of
her
crutch
.
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
my
poor
dear
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
in
the
first
soft
tones
which
had
fallen
from
her
,
in
my
hearing
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
my
lost
darling
!
<EOS>
what
could
you
see
in
this
man
?
"
<EOS>
She
lifted
her
head
again
fiercely
,
and
looked
at
me
once
more
.
"
<EOS>
Can
you
eat
and
drink
?
<EOS>
"
she
asked
.
  
<EOS>
I
did
my
best
to
preserve
my
gravity
,
and
answered
,
"
Yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Can
you
sleep
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
When
you
see
a
poor
girl
in
service
,
do
you
feel
no
remorse
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Certainly
not
.
<EOS>
Why
should
I
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
abruptly
thrust
the
letter
(
as
the
phrase
is
)
into
my
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
Take
it
!
"
<EOS>
she
exclaimed
furiously
.
<EOS>
"
I
never
set
eyes
on
you
before
.
<EOS>
God
Almighty
forbid
<EOS>
I
should
ever
set
eyes
on
you
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
With
those
parting
words
she
limped
away
from
me
at
the
top
of
her
speed
.
<EOS>
The
one
interpretation
that
I
could
put
on
her
conduct
has
,
no
doubt
,
been
anticipated
by
everybody
.
<EOS>
I
could
only
suppose
that
she
was
mad
.
  
<EOS>
Having
reached
that
inevitable
conclusion
,
I
turned
to
the
more
interesting
object
of
investigation
which
was
presented
to
me
by
Rosanna
Spearman
's
letter
.
<EOS>
The
address
was
written
as
follows
:
 
"
<EOS>
For
Franklin
Blake
,
Esq
.
<EOS>
To
be
given
into
his
own
hands
(
and
not
to
be
trusted
to
any
one
else
)
,
by
Lucy
Yolland
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
broke
the
seal
.
<EOS>
The
envelope
contained
a
letter
:
and
this
,
in
its
turn
,
contained
a
slip
of
paper
.
<EOS>
I
read
the
letter
first
:
    
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
 
If
you
are
curious
to
know
the
meaning
of
my
behaviour
to
you
,
whilst
you
were
staying
in
the
house
of
my
mistress
,
Lady
Verinder
,
do
what
you
are
told
to
do
in
the
memorandum
enclosed
with
this
 
and
do
it
without
any
person
being
present
to
overlook
you
.
<EOS>
Your
humble
servant
,
  
"
ROSANNA
SPEARMAN
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
turned
to
the
slip
of
paper
next
.
<EOS>
Here
is
the
literal
copy
of
it
,
word
for
word
:
  
"
Memorandum
:
 
To
go
to
the
Shivering
Sand
at
the
turn
of
the
tide
.
<EOS>
To
walk
out
on
the
South
Spit
,
until
I
get
the
South
Spit
Beacon
,
and
the
flagstaff
at
the
Coast
-
guard
station
above
Cobb
's
Hole
in
a
line
together
.
<EOS>
To
lay
down
on
the
rocks
,
a
stick
,
or
any
straight
thing
to
guide
my
hand
,
exactly
in
the
line
of
the
beacon
and
the
flagstaff
.
<EOS>
To
take
care
,
in
doing
this
,
that
one
end
of
the
stick
shall
be
at
the
edge
of
the
rocks
,
on
the
side
of
them
which
overlooks
the
quicksand
.
<EOS>
To
feel
along
the
stick
,
among
the
sea
-
weed
(
beginning
from
the
end
of
the
stick
which
points
towards
the
beacon
)
,
for
the
Chain
.
<EOS>
To
run
my
hand
along
the
Chain
,
when
found
,
until
I
come
to
the
part
of
it
which
stretches
over
the
edge
of
the
rocks
,
down
into
the
quicksand
.
<EOS>
AND
THEN
TO
PULL
THE
CHAIN
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Just
as
I
had
read
the
last
words
 
underlined
in
the
original
 
<EOS>
I
heard
the
voice
of
Betteredge
behind
me
.
<EOS>
The
inventor
of
the
detective
-
fever
had
completely
succumbed
to
that
irresistible
malady
.
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
stand
it
any
longer
,
Mr.
Franklin
.
<EOS>
What
does
her
letter
say
?
<EOS>
For
mercy
's
sake
,
sir
,
tell
us
,
what
does
her
letter
say
?
"
  
<EOS>
I
handed
him
the
letter
,
and
the
memorandum
.
<EOS>
He
read
the
first
without
appearing
to
be
much
interested
in
it
.
<EOS>
But
the
second
 
the
memorandum
 
produced
a
strong
impression
on
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
Sergeant
said
it
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Betteredge
.
<EOS>
"
From
first
to
last
,
sir
,
the
Sergeant
said
she
had
got
a
memorandum
of
the
hiding
-
place
.
<EOS>
And
here
it
is
!
<EOS>
Lord
save
us
,
Mr.
Franklin
,
here
is
the
secret
that
puzzled
everybody
,
from
the
great
Cuff
downwards
,
ready
and
waiting
,
as
one
may
say
,
to
show
itself
to
YOU
!
<EOS>
It
's
the
ebb
now
,
sir
,
as
anybody
may
see
for
themselves
.
<EOS>
How
long
will
it
be
till
the
turn
of
the
tide
?
"
<EOS>
He
looked
up
,
and
observed
a
lad
at
work
,
at
some
little
distance
from
us
,
mending
a
net
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Tammie
Bright
!
"
<EOS>
he
shouted
at
the
top
of
his
voice
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hear
you
!
"
<EOS>
Tammie
shouted
back
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
When
's
the
turn
of
the
tide
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
In
an
hour
's
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
We
both
looked
at
our
watches
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
can
go
round
by
the
coast
,
Mr.
Franklin
,
"
said
Betteredge
;
"
and
get
to
the
quicksand
in
that
way
with
plenty
of
time
to
spare
.
<EOS>
What
do
you
say
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Come
along
!
"
  
<EOS>
On
our
way
to
the
Shivering
Sand
,
I
applied
to
Betteredge
to
revive
my
memory
of
events
(
as
affecting
Rosanna
Spearman
)
at
the
period
of
Sergeant
Cuff
's
inquiry
.
<EOS>
With
my
old
friend
's
help
,
I
soon
had
the
succession
of
circumstances
clearly
registered
in
my
mind
.
<EOS>
Rosanna
's
journey
to
Frizinghall
,
when
the
whole
household
believed
her
to
be
ill
in
her
own
room
 
Rosanna
's
mysterious
employment
of
the
night
-
time
with
her
door
locked
,
and
her
candle
burning
till
the
morning
 
<EOS>
Rosanna
's
suspicious
purchase
of
the
japanned
tin
case
,
and
the
two
dog
's
chains
from
Mrs.
Yolland
 
<EOS>
the
Sergeant
's
positive
conviction
that
Rosanna
had
hidden
something
at
the
Shivering
Sand
,
and
the
Sergeant
's
absolute
ignorance
as
to
what
that
something
might
be
 
all
these
strange
results
of
the
abortive
inquiry
into
the
loss
of
the
Moonstone
were
clearly
present
to
me
again
,
when
we
reached
the
quicksand
,
and
walked
out
together
on
the
low
ledge
of
rocks
called
the
South
Spit
.
  
<EOS>
With
Betteredge
's
help
,
I
soon
stood
in
the
right
position
to
see
the
Beacon
and
the
Coast
-
guard
flagstaff
in
a
line
together
.
<EOS>
Following
the
memorandum
as
our
guide
,
we
next
laid
my
stick
in
the
necessary
direction
,
as
neatly
as
we
could
,
on
the
uneven
surface
of
the
rocks
.
<EOS>
And
then
we
looked
at
our
watches
once
more
.
  
<EOS>
It
wanted
nearly
twenty
minutes
yet
of
the
turn
of
the
tide
.
<EOS>
I
suggested
waiting
through
this
interval
on
the
beach
,
instead
of
on
the
wet
and
slippery
surface
of
the
rocks
.
<EOS>
Having
reached
the
dry
sand
,
I
prepared
to
sit
down
;
and
,
greatly
to
my
surprise
,
Betteredge
prepared
to
leave
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
are
you
going
away
for
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
Look
at
the
letter
again
,
sir
,
and
you
will
see
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
A
glance
at
the
letter
reminded
me
that
I
was
charged
,
when
I
made
my
discovery
,
to
make
it
alone
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
hard
enough
for
me
to
leave
you
,
at
such
a
time
as
this
,
"
said
Betteredge
.
<EOS>
"
But
she
died
a
dreadful
death
,
poor
soul
 
<EOS>
and
I
feel
a
kind
of
call
on
me
,
Mr.
Franklin
,
to
humour
that
fancy
of
hers
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
"
he
added
,
confidentially
,
"
there
's
nothing
in
the
letter
against
your
letting
out
the
secret
afterwards
.
<EOS>
I
'll
hang
about
in
the
fir
plantation
,
and
wait
till
you
pick
me
up
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
be
longer
than
you
can
help
,
sir
.
<EOS>
The
detective
-
fever
is
n't
an
easy
disease
to
deal
with
,
under
THESE
circumstances
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
With
that
parting
caution
,
he
left
me
.
  
<EOS>
The
interval
of
expectation
,
short
as
it
was
when
reckoned
by
the
measure
of
time
,
assumed
formidable
proportions
when
reckoned
by
the
measure
of
suspense
.
<EOS>
This
was
one
of
the
occasions
on
which
the
invaluable
habit
of
smoking
becomes
especially
precious
and
consolatory
.
<EOS>
I
lit
a
cigar
,
and
sat
down
on
the
slope
of
the
beach
.
  
<EOS>
The
sunlight
poured
its
unclouded
beauty
on
every
object
that
I
could
see
.
<EOS>
The
exquisite
freshness
of
the
air
made
the
mere
act
of
living
and
breathing
a
luxury
.
<EOS>
Even
the
lonely
little
bay
welcomed
the
morning
with
a
show
of
cheerfulness
;
and
the
bared
wet
surface
of
the
quicksand
itself
,
glittering
with
a
golden
brightness
,
hid
the
horror
of
its
false
brown
face
under
a
passing
smile
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
finest
day
I
had
seen
since
my
return
to
England
.
  
<EOS>
The
turn
of
the
tide
came
,
before
my
cigar
was
finished
.
<EOS>
I
saw
the
preliminary
heaving
of
the
Sand
,
and
then
the
awful
shiver
that
crept
over
its
surface
 
as
if
some
spirit
of
terror
lived
and
moved
and
shuddered
in
the
fathomless
deeps
beneath
.
<EOS>
I
threw
away
my
cigar
,
and
went
back
again
to
the
rocks
.
  
<EOS>
My
directions
in
the
memorandum
instructed
me
to
feel
along
the
line
traced
by
the
stick
,
beginning
with
the
end
which
was
nearest
to
the
beacon
.
  
<EOS>
I
advanced
,
in
this
manner
,
more
than
half
way
along
the
stick
,
without
encountering
anything
<EOS>
but
the
edges
of
the
rocks
.
<EOS>
An
inch
or
two
further
on
,
however
,
my
patience
was
rewarded
.
<EOS>
In
a
narrow
little
fissure
,
just
within
reach
of
my
forefinger
,
I
felt
the
chain
.
<EOS>
Attempting
,
next
,
to
follow
it
,
by
touch
,
in
the
direction
of
the
quicksand
,
I
found
my
progress
stopped
by
a
thick
growth
of
seaweed
 
which
had
fastened
itself
into
the
fissure
,
no
doubt
,
in
the
time
that
had
elapsed
since
Rosanna
Spearman
had
chosen
her
hiding
-
place
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
equally
impossible
to
pull
up
the
seaweed
,
or
to
force
my
hand
through
it
.
<EOS>
After
marking
the
spot
indicated
by
the
end
of
the
stick
which
was
placed
nearest
to
the
quicksand
,
I
determined
to
pursue
the
search
for
the
chain
on
a
plan
of
my
own
.
<EOS>
My
idea
was
to
"
sound
"
immediately
under
the
rocks
,
on
the
chance
of
recovering
the
lost
trace
of
the
chain
at
the
point
at
which
it
entered
the
sand
.
<EOS>
I
took
up
the
stick
,
and
knelt
down
on
the
brink
of
the
South
Spit
.
  
<EOS>
In
this
position
,
my
face
was
within
a
few
feet
of
the
surface
of
the
quicksand
.
<EOS>
The
sight
of
it
so
near
me
,
still
disturbed
at
intervals
by
its
hideous
shivering
fit
,
shook
my
nerves
for
the
moment
.
<EOS>
A
horrible
fancy
that
the
dead
woman
might
appear
on
the
scene
of
her
suicide
,
to
assist
my
search
 
an
unutterable
dread
of
seeing
her
rise
through
the
heaving
surface
of
the
sand
,
and
point
to
the
place
 
forced
itself
into
my
mind
,
and
turned
me
cold
in
the
warm
sunlight
.
<EOS>
I
own
<EOS>
I
closed
my
eyes
at
the
moment
when
the
point
of
the
stick
first
entered
the
quicksand
.
  
<EOS>
The
instant
afterwards
,
before
the
stick
could
have
been
submerged
more
than
a
few
inches
<EOS>
,
I
was
free
from
the
hold
of
my
own
superstitious
terror
,
and
was
throbbing
with
excitement
from
head
to
foot
.
<EOS>
Sounding
blindfold
,
at
my
first
attempt
 
at
that
first
attempt
I
had
sounded
right
!
<EOS>
The
stick
struck
the
chain
.
  
<EOS>
Taking
a
firm
hold
of
the
roots
of
the
seaweed
with
my
left
hand
,
I
laid
myself
down
over
the
brink
,
and
felt
with
my
right
hand
under
the
overhanging
edges
of
the
rock
.
<EOS>
My
right
hand
found
the
chain
.
  
<EOS>
I
drew
it
up
without
the
slightest
difficulty
.
<EOS>
And
there
was
the
japanned
tin
case
fastened
to
the
end
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
The
action
of
the
water
had
so
rusted
the
chain
,
that
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
unfasten
it
from
the
hasp
which
attached
it
to
the
case
.
<EOS>
Putting
the
case
between
my
knees
and
exerting
my
utmost
strength
,
I
contrived
to
draw
off
the
cover
.
<EOS>
Some
white
substance
filled
the
whole
interior
when
I
looked
in
.
<EOS>
I
put
in
my
hand
,
and
found
it
to
be
linen
.
  
<EOS>
In
drawing
out
the
linen
,
I
also
drew
out
a
letter
crumpled
up
with
it
.
<EOS>
After
looking
at
the
direction
,
and
discovering
that
it
bore
my
name
,
I
put
the
letter
in
my
pocket
,
and
completely
removed
the
linen
.
<EOS>
It
came
out
in
a
thick
roll
,
moulded
,
of
course
,
to
the
shape
of
the
case
in
which
it
had
been
so
long
confined
,
and
perfectly
preserved
from
any
injury
by
the
sea
.
  
<EOS>
I
carried
the
linen
to
the
dry
sand
of
the
beach
,
and
there
unrolled
and
smoothed
it
out
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
mistaking
it
as
an
article
of
dress
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
nightgown
.
  
<EOS>
The
uppermost
side
,
when
I
spread
it
out
,
presented
to
view
innumerable
folds
and
creases
,
and
nothing
more
.
<EOS>
I
tried
the
undermost
side
,
next
 
and
instantly
discovered
the
smear
of
the
paint
from
the
door
of
Rachel
's
boudoir
!
  
<EOS>
My
eyes
remained
riveted
on
the
stain
,
and
my
mind
took
me
back
at
a
leap
from
present
to
past
.
<EOS>
The
very
words
of
Sergeant
Cuff
recurred
to
me
,
as
if
the
man
himself
was
at
my
side
again
,
pointing
to
the
unanswerable
inference
which
he
drew
from
the
smear
on
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
Find
out
whether
there
is
any
article
of
dress
in
this
house
with
the
stain
of
paint
on
it
.
<EOS>
Find
out
who
that
dress
belongs
to
.
<EOS>
Find
out
how
the
person
can
account
for
having
been
in
the
room
,
and
smeared
the
paint
between
midnight
and
three
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
If
the
person
ca
n't
satisfy
you
,
you
have
n't
far
to
look
for
the
hand
that
took
the
Diamond
.
"
  
<EOS>
One
after
another
those
words
travelled
over
my
memory
,
repeating
themselves
again
and
again
with
a
wearisome
,
mechanical
reiteration
.
<EOS>
I
was
roused
from
what
felt
like
a
trance
of
many
hours
 
from
what
was
really
,
no
doubt
,
the
pause
of
a
few
moments
only
 
by
a
voice
calling
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
looked
up
,
and
saw
that
Betteredge
's
patience
had
failed
him
at
last
.
<EOS>
He
was
just
visible
between
the
sandhills
,
returning
to
the
beach
.
  
<EOS>
The
old
man
's
appearance
recalled
me
,
the
moment
I
perceived
it
,
to
my
sense
of
present
things
,
and
reminded
me
that
the
inquiry
which
I
had
pursued
thus
far
still
remained
incomplete
.
<EOS>
I
had
discovered
the
smear
on
the
nightgown
.
<EOS>
To
whom
did
the
nightgown
belong
?
  
<EOS>
My
first
impulse
was
to
consult
the
letter
in
my
pocket
 
<EOS>
the
letter
which
I
had
found
in
the
case
.
  
<EOS>
As
I
raised
my
hand
to
take
it
out
,
I
remembered
that
there
was
a
shorter
way
to
discovery
than
this
.
<EOS>
The
nightgown
itself
would
reveal
the
truth
,
for
,
in
all
probability
,
the
nightgown
was
marked
with
its
owner
's
name
.
  
<EOS>
I
took
it
up
from
the
sand
,
and
looked
for
the
mark
.
  
<EOS>
I
found
the
mark
,
and
read
 
MY
OWN
NAME
.
  
<EOS>
There
were
the
familiar
letters
which
told
me
that
the
nightgown
was
mine
.
<EOS>
I
looked
up
from
them
.
<EOS>
There
was
the
sun
;
there
were
the
glittering
waters
of
the
bay
;
there
was
old
Betteredge
,
advancing
nearer
and
nearer
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
looked
back
again
at
the
letters
.
<EOS>
My
own
name
.
<EOS>
Plainly
confronting
me
 
my
own
name
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
time
,
pains
,
and
money
can
do
it
,
I
will
lay
my
hand
on
the
thief
who
took
the
Moonstone
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
had
left
London
,
with
those
words
on
my
lips
.
<EOS>
I
had
penetrated
the
secret
which
the
quicksand
had
kept
from
every
other
living
creature
.
<EOS>
And
,
on
the
unanswerable
evidence
of
the
paint
-
stain
,
I
had
discovered
Myself
as
the
Thief
.
    
<EOS>
I
have
not
a
word
to
say
about
my
own
sensations
.
  
<EOS>
My
impression
is
that
the
shock
inflicted
on
me
completely
suspended
my
thinking
and
feeling
power
.
<EOS>
I
certainly
could
not
have
known
what
I
was
about
when
Betteredge
joined
me
 
for
I
have
it
on
his
authority
that
I
laughed
,
<EOS>
when
he
asked
what
was
the
matter
,
and
putting
the
nightgown
into
his
hands
,
told
him
to
read
the
riddle
for
himself
.
  
<EOS>
Of
what
was
said
between
us
on
the
beach
,
I
have
not
the
faintest
recollection
.
<EOS>
The
first
place
in
which
I
can
now
see
myself
again
plainly
is
the
plantation
of
firs
.
<EOS>
Betteredge
and
I
are
walking
back
together
to
the
house
;
and
Betteredge
is
telling
me
that
I
shall
be
able
to
face
it
,
and
he
will
be
able
to
face
it
,
when
we
have
had
a
glass
of
grog
.
  
<EOS>
The
scene
shifts
from
the
plantation
,
to
Betteredge
's
little
sitting
-
room
.
<EOS>
My
resolution
not
to
enter
Rachel
's
house
is
forgotten
.
<EOS>
I
feel
gratefully
the
coolness
and
shadiness
and
quiet
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
I
drink
the
grog
(
a
perfectly
new
luxury
to
me
,
at
that
time
of
day
)
,
which
my
good
old
friend
mixes
with
icy
-
cold
water
from
the
well
.
<EOS>
Under
any
other
circumstances
,
the
drink
would
simply
stupefy
me
.
<EOS>
As
things
are
,
it
strings
up
my
nerves
.
<EOS>
I
begin
to
"
face
it
,
"
as
Betteredge
has
predicted
.
<EOS>
And
Betteredge
,
on
his
side
,
begins
to
"
face
it
,
"
too
.
  
<EOS>
The
picture
which
I
am
now
presenting
of
myself
,
will
,
I
suspect
,
be
thought
a
very
strange
one
,
to
say
the
least
of
it
.
<EOS>
Placed
in
a
situation
which
may
,
I
think
,
be
described
as
entirely
without
parallel
,
what
is
the
first
proceeding
to
which
I
resort
?
<EOS>
Do
I
seclude
myself
from
all
human
society
?
<EOS>
Do
I
set
my
mind
to
analyse
the
abominable
impossibility
which
,
nevertheless
,
confronts
me
as
an
undeniable
fact
?
<EOS>
Do
I
hurry
back
to
London
by
the
first
train
to
consult
the
highest
authorities
,
and
to
set
a
searching
inquiry
on
foot
immediately
?
<EOS>
No
.
<EOS>
I
accept
the
shelter
of
a
house
which
I
had
resolved
never
to
degrade
myself
by
entering
again
;
and
I
sit
,
tippling
spirits
and
water
in
the
company
of
an
old
servant
,
at
ten
o'clock
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
Is
this
the
conduct
that
might
have
been
expected
from
a
man
placed
in
my
horrible
position
?
<EOS>
I
can
only
answer
that
the
sight
of
old
Betteredge
's
familiar
face
was
an
inexpressible
comfort
to
me
,
and
that
the
drinking
of
old
Betteredge
's
grog
helped
me
,
as
I
believe
nothing
else
would
have
helped
me
,
in
the
state
of
complete
bodily
and
mental
prostration
into
which
I
had
fallen
.
<EOS>
I
can
only
offer
this
excuse
for
myself
;
and
I
can
only
admire
that
invariable
preservation
of
dignity
,
and
that
strictly
logical
consistency
of
conduct
which
distinguish
every
man
and
woman
who
may
read
these
lines
,
in
every
emergency
of
their
lives
from
the
cradle
to
the
grave
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
Mr.
Franklin
,
there
's
one
thing
certain
,
at
any
rate
,
"
said
Betteredge
,
throwing
the
nightgown
down
on
the
table
between
us
,
and
pointing
to
it
as
if
it
was
a
living
creature
that
could
hear
him
.
"
<EOS>
HE
'S
a
liar
,
to
begin
with
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
comforting
view
of
the
matter
was
not
the
view
that
presented
itself
to
my
mind
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
as
innocent
of
all
knowledge
of
having
taken
the
Diamond
as
you
are
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
But
there
is
the
witness
against
me
!
<EOS>
The
paint
on
the
nightgown
,
and
the
name
on
the
nightgown
are
facts
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Betteredge
lifted
my
glass
,
and
put
it
persuasively
into
my
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
Facts

"
he
repeated
.
<EOS>
"
Take
a
drop
more
grog
,
Mr.
Franklin
,
and
you
'll
get
over
the
weakness
of
believing
in
facts
!
<EOS>
Foul
play
,
sir
!
"
<EOS>
he
continued
,
dropping
his
voice
confidentially
.
<EOS>
"
That
is
how
I
read
the
riddle
.
<EOS>
Foul
play
somewhere
 
<EOS>
and
you
and
I
must
find
it
out
.
<EOS>
Was
there
nothing
else
in
the
tin
case
,
when
you
put
your
hand
into
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
question
instantly
reminded
me
of
the
letter
in
my
pocket
.
<EOS>
I
took
it
out
,
and
opened
it
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
letter
of
many
pages
,
closely
written
.
<EOS>
I
looked
impatiently
for
the
signature
at
the
end
.
"
<EOS>
Rosanna
Spearman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
As
I
read
the
name
,
a
sudden
remembrance
illuminated
my
mind
,
and
a
sudden
suspicion
rose
out
of
the
new
light
.
  
<EOS>
"
Stop
!
"
<EOS>
I
exclaimed
.
"
<EOS>
Rosanna
Spearman
came
to
my
aunt
out
of
a
reformatory
?
<EOS>
Rosanna
Spearman
had
once
been
a
thief
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
no
denying
<EOS>
that
,
Mr.
Franklin
.
<EOS>
What
of
it
now
,
if
you
please
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
of
it
now
?
<EOS>
How
do
we
know
she
may
not
have
stolen
the
Diamond
after
all
?
<EOS>
How
do
we
know
she
may
not
have
smeared
my
nightgown
purposely
with
the
paint
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Betteredge
laid
his
hand
on
my
arm
,
and
stopped
me
before
I
could
say
any
more
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
be
cleared
of
this
,
Mr.
Franklin
,
beyond
all
doubt
.
<EOS>
But
I
hope
you
wo
n't
be
cleared
in
THAT
way
.
<EOS>
See
what
the
letter
says
,
sir
.
<EOS>
In
justice
to
the
girl
's
memory
,
see
what
it
says
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
felt
the
earnestness
with
which
he
spoke
 
felt
it
as
a
friendly
rebuke
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
You
shall
form
your
own
judgment
on
her
letter
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
read
it
out
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
began
 
and
read
these
lines
:
  
"
Sir
 
I
have
something
to
own
to
you
.
<EOS>
A
confession
which
means
much
misery
,
may
sometimes
be
made
in
very
few
words
.
<EOS>
This
confession
can
be
made
in
three
words
.
<EOS>
I
love
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
letter
dropped
from
my
hand
.
<EOS>
I
looked
at
Betteredge
.
<EOS>
"
In
the
name
of
Heaven
,
"
I
said
,
"
what
does
it
mean
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
seemed
to
shrink
from
answering
the
question
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
and
Limping
Lucy
were
alone
together
this
morning
,
sir
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
Did
she
say
nothing
about
Rosanna
Spearman
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
never
even
mentioned
Rosanna
Spearman
's
name
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Please
to
go
back
to
the
letter
,
Mr.
Franklin
.
<EOS>
I
tell
you
plainly
,
I
ca
n't
find
it
in
my
heart
to
distress
you
,
after
what
you
have
had
to
bear
already
.
<EOS>
Let
her
speak
for
herself
,
sir
.
<EOS>
And
get
on
with
your
grog
.
<EOS>
For
your
own
sake
,
get
on
with
your
grog
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
resumed
the
reading
of
the
letter
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
very
disgraceful
to
me
to
tell
you
this
,
if
I
was
a
living
woman
when
you
read
it
.
<EOS>
I
shall
be
dead
and
gone
,
sir
,
when
you
find
my
letter
.
<EOS>
It
is
that
which
makes
me
bold
.
<EOS>
Not
even
my
grave
will
be
left
to
tell
of
me
.
<EOS>
I
may
own
the
truth
 
with
the
quicksand
waiting
to
hide
me
when
the
words
are
written
.
  
<EOS>
"
Besides
,
you
will
find
your
nightgown
in
my
hiding
-
place
,
with
the
smear
of
the
paint
on
it
;
and
you
will
want
to
know
how
it
came
to
be
hidden
by
me
?
<EOS>
and
why
I
said
nothing
to
you
about
it
in
my
life
-
time
?
<EOS>
I
have
only
one
reason
to
give
.
<EOS>
I
did
these
strange
things
,
because
I
loved
you
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wo
n't
trouble
you
with
much
about
myself
,
or
my
life
,
before
you
came
to
my
lady
's
house
.
<EOS>
Lady
Verinder
took
me
out
of
a
reformatory
.
<EOS>
I
had
gone
to
the
reformatory
from
the
prison
.
<EOS>
I
was
put
in
the
prison
,
because
I
was
a
thief
.
<EOS>
I
was
a
thief
,
because
my
mother
went
on
the
streets
when
I
was
quite
a
little
girl
.
<EOS>
My
mother
went
on
the
streets
,
because
the
gentleman
who
was
my
father
deserted
her
.
<EOS>
There
is
no
need
to
tell
such
a
common
story
as
this
,
at
any
length
.
<EOS>
It
is
told
quite
often
enough
in
the
newspapers
.
  
<EOS>
"
Lady
Verinder
was
very
kind
to
me
,
and
Mr.
Betteredge
was
very
kind
to
me
.
<EOS>
Those
two
,
and
the
matron
at
the
reformatory
,
are
the
only
good
people
I
have
ever
met
with
in
all
my
life
.
<EOS>
I
might
have
got
on
in
my
place
 
not
happily
 
<EOS>
but
I
might
have
got
on
,
if
you
had
not
come
visiting
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
blame
you
,
sir
.
<EOS>
It
's
my
fault
 
<EOS>
all
my
fault
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
remember
when
you
came
out
on
us
from
among
the
sand
hills
,
that
morning
,
looking
for
Mr.
Betteredge
?
<EOS>
You
were
like
a
prince
in
a
fairy
-
story
.
<EOS>
You
were
like
a
lover
in
a
dream
.
<EOS>
You
were
the
most
adorable
human
creature
I
had
ever
seen
.
<EOS>
Something
that
felt
like
the
happy
life
I
had
never
led
yet
,
leapt
up
in
me
at
the
instant
I
set
eyes
on
you
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
laugh
at
this
if
you
can
help
it
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
if
I
could
only
make
you
feel
how
serious
it
is
to
ME
!
  
<EOS>
"
I
went
back
to
the
house
,
and
wrote
your
name
and
mine
in
my
work
-
box
,
and
drew
a
true
lovers
'
knot
under
them
.
<EOS>
Then
,
some
devil
 
<EOS>
no
,
I
ought
to
say
some
good
angel
 
whispered
to
me
,
"
Go
and
look
in
the
glass
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
glass
told
me
 
never
mind
what
.
<EOS>
I
was
too
foolish
to
take
the
warning
.
<EOS>
I
went
on
getting
fonder
and
fonder
of
you
,
just
as
if
I
was
a
lady
in
your
own
rank
of
life
,
and
the
most
beautiful
creature
your
eyes
ever
rested
on
.
<EOS>
I
tried
 
<EOS>
oh
,
dear
,
how
I
tried
 
to
get
you
to
look
at
me
.
<EOS>
If
you
had
known
how
I
used
to
cry
at
night
with
the
misery
and
the
mortification
of
your
never
taking
any
notice
of
me
,
you
would
have
pitied
me
perhaps
,
and
have
given
me
a
look
now
and
then
to
live
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
would
have
been
no
very
kind
look
,
perhaps
,
if
you
had
known
how
I
hated
Miss
Rachel
.
<EOS>
I
believe
I
found
out
you
were
in
love
with
her
,
before
you
knew
it
yourself
.
<EOS>
She
used
to
give
you
roses
to
wear
in
your
button
-
hole
.
<EOS>
Ah
,
Mr.
Franklin
,
you
wore
my
roses
oftener
than
either
you
<EOS>
or
she
thought
!
<EOS>
The
only
comfort
I
had
at
that
time
,
was
putting
my
rose
secretly
in
your
glass
of
water
,
in
place
of
hers
 
and
then
throwing
her
rose
away
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
she
had
been
really
as
pretty
as
you
thought
her
,
I
might
have
borne
it
better
.
<EOS>
No
;
I
believe
I
should
have
been
more
spiteful
against
her
still
.
<EOS>
Suppose
you
put
Miss
Rachel
into
a
servant
's
dress
,
and
took
her
ornaments
off
?
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
what
is
the
use
of
my
writing
in
this
way
.
<EOS>
It
ca
n't
be
denied
that
she
had
a
bad
figure
;
she
was
too
thin
.
<EOS>
But
who
can
tell
what
the
men
like
?
<EOS>
And
young
ladies
may
behave
in
a
manner
which
would
cost
a
servant
her
place
.
<EOS>
It
's
no
business
of
mine
.
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
expect
you
to
read
my
letter
,
if
I
write
it
in
this
way
.
<EOS>
But
it
does
stir
one
up
to
hear
Miss
Rachel
called
pretty
,
when
one
knows
all
the
time
that
it
's
her
dress
does
it
,
and
her
confidence
in
herself
.
  
<EOS>
"
Try
not
to
lose
patience
with
me
,
sir
.
<EOS>
I
will
get
on
as
fast
as
I
can
to
the
time
which
is
sure
to
interest
you
 
the
time
when
the
Diamond
was
lost
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
there
is
one
thing
which
I
have
got
it
on
my
mind
to
tell
you
first
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
life
was
not
a
very
hard
life
to
bear
,
while
I
was
a
thief
.
<EOS>
It
was
only
when
they
had
taught
me
at
the
reformatory
to
feel
my
own
degradation
,
and
to
try
for
better
things
,
that
the
days
grew
long
and
weary
.
<EOS>
Thoughts
of
the
future
forced
themselves
on
me
now
.
<EOS>
I
felt
the
dreadful
reproach
that
honest
people
 
even
the
kindest
of
honest
people
 
were
to
me
in
themselves
.
<EOS>
A
heart
-
breaking
sensation
of
loneliness
kept
with
me
,
go
where
I
might
,
and
do
what
I
might
,
and
see
what
persons
I
might
.
<EOS>
It
was
my
duty
,
I
know
,
to
try
and
get
on
with
my
fellow
-
servants
in
my
new
place
.
<EOS>
Somehow
,
I
could
n't
make
friends
with
them
.
<EOS>
They
looked
(
or
I
thought
they
looked
)
as
if
they
suspected
what
I
had
been
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
regret
,
far
from
it
,
having
been
roused
to
make
the
effort
to
be
a
reformed
woman
 
<EOS>
but
,
indeed
,
indeed
it
was
a
weary
life
.
<EOS>
You
had
come
across
it
like
a
beam
of
sunshine
at
first
 
<EOS>
and
then
you
too
failed
me
.
<EOS>
I
was
mad
enough
to
love
you
;
and
I
could
n't
even
attract
your
notice
.
<EOS>
There
was
great
misery
 
there
really
was
great
misery
in
that
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
I
am
coming
to
what
I
wanted
to
tell
you
.
<EOS>
In
those
days
of
bitterness
,
I
went
two
or
three
times
,
when
it
was
my
turn
to
go
out
,
to
my
favourite
place
 
the
beach
above
the
Shivering
Sand
.
<EOS>
And
I
said
to
myself
,
"
I
think
it
will
end
here
.
<EOS>
When
I
can
bear
it
no
longer
,
I
think
it
will
end
here
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
understand
,
sir
,
that
the
place
had
laid
a
kind
of
spell
on
me
before
you
came
.
<EOS>
I
had
always
had
a
notion
that
something
would
happen
to
me
at
the
quicksand
.
<EOS>
But
I
had
never
looked
at
it
,
with
the
thought
of
its
being
the
means
of
my
making
away
with
myself
,
till
the
time
came
of
which
I
am
now
writing
.
<EOS>
Then
I
did
think
that
here
was
a
place
which
would
end
all
my
troubles
for
me
in
a
moment
or
two
 
and
hide
me
for
ever
afterwards
.
  
<EOS>
"
This
is
all
I
have
to
say
about
myself
,
reckoning
from
the
morning
when
I
first
saw
you
,
to
the
morning
when
the
alarm
was
raised
in
the
house
that
the
Diamond
was
lost
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
so
aggravated
by
the
foolish
talk
among
the
women
servants
,
all
wondering
who
was
to
be
suspected
first
;
and
I
was
so
angry
with
you
(
knowing
no
better
at
that
time
)
for
the
pains
you
took
in
hunting
for
the
jewel
,
and
sending
for
the
police
,
that
I
kept
as
much
as
possible
away
by
myself
,
until
later
in
the
day
,
when
the
officer
from
Frizinghall
came
to
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Seegrave
began
,
as
you
may
remember
,
by
setting
a
guard
on
the
women
's
bedrooms
;
and
the
women
all
followed
him
up
-
stairs
in
a
rage
,
to
know
what
he
meant
by
the
insult
he
had
put
on
them
.
<EOS>
I
went
with
the
rest
,
because
if
I
had
done
anything
different
from
the
rest
,
Mr.
Seegrave
was
the
sort
of
man
who
would
have
suspected
me
directly
.
<EOS>
We
found
him
in
Miss
Rachel
's
room
.
<EOS>
He
told
us
he
would
n't
have
a
lot
of
women
there
;
and
he
pointed
to
the
smear
on
the
painted
door
,
and
said
some
of
our
petticoats
had
done
the
mischief
,
and
sent
us
all
down
-
stairs
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
After
leaving
Miss
Rachel
's
room
,
I
stopped
a
moment
on
one
of
the
landings
,
by
myself
,
to
see
if
I
had
got
the
paint
-
stain
by
any
chance
on
MY
gown
.
<EOS>
Penelope
Betteredge
(
the
only
one
of
the
women
with
whom
I
was
on
friendly
terms
)
passed
,
and
noticed
what
I
was
about
.
  
<EOS>
"
"
You
need
n't
trouble
yourself
,
Rosanna
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
The
paint
on
Miss
Rachel
's
door
has
been
dry
for
hours
.
<EOS>
If
Mr.
Seegrave
had
n't
set
a
watch
on
our
bedrooms
,
I
might
have
told
him
as
much
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
what
you
think
 
<EOS>
I
was
never
so
insulted
before
in
my
life
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Penelope
was
a
hot
-
tempered
girl
.
<EOS>
I
quieted
her
,
and
brought
her
back
to
what
she
had
said
about
the
paint
on
the
door
having
been
dry
for
hours
.
  
<EOS>
"
"
How
do
you
know
that
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
"
I
was
with
Miss
Rachel
,
and
Mr.
Franklin
,
all
yesterday
morning
,
"
Penelope
said
,
"
mixing
the
colours
,
while
they
finished
the
door
.
<EOS>
I
heard
Miss
Rachel
ask
whether
the
door
would
be
dry
that
evening
,
in
time
for
the
birthday
company
to
see
it
.
<EOS>
And
Mr.
Franklin
shook
his
head
,
and
said
it
would
n't
be
dry
in
less
than
twelve
hours
.
<EOS>
It
was
long
past
luncheon
-
time
 
<EOS>
it
was
three
o'clock
before
they
had
done
.
<EOS>
What
does
your
arithmetic
say
,
Rosanna
?
<EOS>
Mine
says
the
door
was
dry
by
three
this
morning
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
"
Did
some
of
the
ladies
go
up
-
stairs
yesterday
evening
to
see
it
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
<EOS>
"
I
thought
I
heard
Miss
Rachel
warning
them
to
keep
clear
of
the
door
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
"
None
of
the
ladies
made
the
smear
,
"
Penelope
answered
.
<EOS>
"
I
left
Miss
Rachel
in
bed
at
twelve
last
night
.
<EOS>
And
I
noticed
the
door
,
and
there
was
nothing
wrong
with
it
then
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
"
Ought
n't
you
to
mention
this
to
Mr.
Seegrave
,
Penelope
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
"
I
would
n't
say
a
word
to
help
Mr.
Seegrave
for
anything
that
could
be
offered
to
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
went
to
her
work
,
and
I
went
to
mine
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
work
,
sir
,
was
to
make
your
bed
,
and
to
put
your
room
tidy
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
happiest
hour
I
had
in
the
whole
day
.
<EOS>
I
used
to
kiss
the
pillow
on
which
your
head
had
rested
all
night
.
<EOS>
No
matter
who
has
done
it
since
,
you
have
never
had
your
clothes
folded
as
nicely
as
I
folded
them
for
you
.
<EOS>
Of
all
the
little
knick
-
knacks
in
your
dressing
-
case
,
there
was
n't
one
that
had
so
much
as
a
speck
on
it
.
<EOS>
You
never
noticed
it
,
any
more
than
you
noticed
me
.
<EOS>
I
beg
your
pardon
;
I
am
forgetting
myself
.
<EOS>
I
will
make
haste
,
and
go
on
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
went
in
that
morning
to
do
my
work
in
your
room
.
<EOS>
There
was
your
nightgown
tossed
across
the
bed
,
just
as
you
had
thrown
it
off
.
<EOS>
I
took
it
up
to
fold
it
 
<EOS>
and
I
saw
the
stain
of
the
paint
from
Miss
Rachel
's
door
!
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
so
startled
by
the
discovery
that
I
ran
out
with
the
nightgown
in
my
hand
,
and
made
for
the
back
stairs
,
and
locked
myself
into
my
own
room
,
to
look
at
it
in
a
place
where
nobody
could
intrude
and
interrupt
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
As
soon
as
I
got
my
breath
again
,
I
called
to
mind
my
talk
with
Penelope
,
and
I
said
to
myself
,
"
Here
's
the
proof
that
he
was
in
Miss
Rachel
's
sitting
-
room
between
twelve
last
night
,
and
three
this
morning
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
not
tell
you
in
plain
words
<EOS>
what
was
the
first
suspicion
that
crossed
my
mind
,
when
I
had
made
that
discovery
.
<EOS>
You
would
only
be
angry
 
and
,
if
you
were
angry
,
you
might
tear
my
letter
up
and
read
no
more
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Let
it
be
enough
,
if
you
please
,
to
say
only
this
.
<EOS>
After
thinking
it
over
to
the
best
of
my
ability
,
I
made
it
out
that
the
thing
was
n't
likely
,
for
a
reason
that
I
will
tell
you
.
<EOS>
If
you
had
been
in
Miss
Rachel
's
sitting
-
room
,
at
that
time
of
night
,
with
Miss
Rachel
's
knowledge
(
and
if
you
had
been
foolish
enough
to
forget
to
take
care
of
the
wet
door
)
<EOS>
SHE
would
have
reminded
you
 
<EOS>
SHE
would
never
have
let
you
carry
away
such
a
witness
against
her
,
as
the
witness
I
was
looking
at
now
!
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
,
I
own
I
was
not
completely
certain
in
my
own
mind
that
I
had
proved
my
own
suspicion
to
be
wrong
.
<EOS>
You
will
not
have
forgotten
that
I
have
owned
to
hating
Miss
Rachel
.
<EOS>
Try
to
think
,
if
you
can
,
that
there
was
a
little
of
that
hatred
in
all
this
.
<EOS>
It
ended
in
my
determining
to
keep
the
nightgown
,
and
to
wait
,
and
watch
,
and
see
what
use
I
might
make
of
it
.
<EOS>
At
that
time
,
please
to
remember
,
not
the
ghost
of
an
idea
entered
my
head
that
you
had
stolen
the
Diamond
.
"
  
<EOS>
There
,
I
broke
off
in
the
reading
of
the
letter
for
the
second
time
.
  
<EOS>
I
had
read
those
portions
of
the
miserable
woman
's
confession
which
related
to
myself
,
with
unaffected
surprise
,
and
,
I
can
honestly
add
,
with
sincere
distress
.
<EOS>
I
had
regretted
,
truly
regretted
,
the
aspersion
which
I
had
thoughtlessly
cast
on
her
memory
,
before
I
had
seen
a
line
of
her
letter
.
<EOS>
But
when
I
had
advanced
as
far
as
the
passage
which
is
quoted
above
,
I
own
<EOS>
I
felt
my
mind
growing
bitterer
and
bitterer
against
Rosanna
Spearman
as
I
went
on
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Read
the
rest
for
yourself
,
"
I
said
,
handing
the
letter
to
Betteredge
across
the
table
.
<EOS>
"
If
there
is
anything
in
it
that
I
must
look
at
,
you
can
tell
me
as
you
go
on
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
understand
you
,
Mr.
Franklin
,
"
he
answered
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
natural
,
sir
,
in
YOU
.
<EOS>
And
,
God
help
us
all
!
"
<EOS>
he
added
,
in
a
lower
tone
,
"
it
's
no
less
natural
in
HER
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
proceed
to
copy
the
continuation
of
the
letter
from
the
original
,
in
my
own
possession
:
    
"
Having
determined
to
keep
the
nightgown
,
and
to
see
what
use
my
love
,
or
my
revenge
(
I
hardly
know
which
)
could
turn
it
to
in
the
future
,
the
next
thing
to
discover
was
how
to
keep
it
without
the
risk
of
being
found
out
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
was
only
one
way
 
to
make
another
nightgown
exactly
like
it
,
before
Saturday
came
,
and
brought
the
laundry
-
woman
and
her
inventory
to
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
afraid
to
put
it
off
till
next
day
(
the
Friday
)
;
being
in
doubt
lest
some
accident
might
happen
in
the
interval
.
<EOS>
I
determined
to
make
the
new
nightgown
on
that
same
day
(
the
Thursday
)
,
while
I
could
count
,
if
I
played
my
cards
properly
,
on
having
my
time
to
myself
.
<EOS>
The
first
thing
to
do
(
after
locking
up
your
nightgown
in
my
drawer
)
was
to
go
back
to
your
bed
-
room
 
not
so
much
to
put
it
to
rights
<EOS>
(
Penelope
would
have
done
that
for
me
,
if
I
had
asked
her
)
as
to
find
out
whether
you
had
smeared
off
any
of
the
paint
-
stain
from
your
nightgown
,
on
the
bed
,
or
on
any
piece
of
furniture
in
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
examined
everything
narrowly
,
and
at
last
,
I
found
a
few
streaks
of
the
paint
on
the
inside
of
your
dressing
-
gown
 
not
the
linen
<EOS>
dressing
-
gown
you
usually
wore
in
that
summer
season
,
but
a
flannel
dressing
-
gown
which
you
had
with
you
also
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
you
felt
chilly
after
walking
to
and
fro
in
nothing
but
your
nightdress
,
and
put
on
the
warmest
thing
you
could
find
.
<EOS>
At
any
rate
,
there
were
the
stains
,
just
visible
,
on
the
inside
of
the
dressing
-
gown
.
<EOS>
I
easily
got
rid
of
these
by
scraping
away
the
stuff
of
the
flannel
.
<EOS>
This
done
,
the
only
proof
left
against
you
was
the
proof
locked
up
in
my
drawer
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
had
just
finished
your
room
when
I
was
sent
for
to
be
questioned
by
Mr.
Seegrave
,
along
with
the
rest
of
the
servants
.
<EOS>
Next
came
the
examination
of
all
our
boxes
.
<EOS>
And
then
followed
the
most
extraordinary
event
of
the
day
 
to
ME
 
since
I
had
found
the
paint
on
your
nightgown
.
<EOS>
This
event
came
out
of
the
second
questioning
of
Penelope
Betteredge
by
Superintendent
Seegrave
.
  
<EOS>
"
Penelope
returned
to
us
quite
beside
herself
with
rage
at
the
manner
in
which
Mr.
Seegrave
had
treated
her
.
<EOS>
He
had
hinted
,
beyond
the
possibility
of
mistaking
him
,
that
he
suspected
her
of
being
the
thief
.
<EOS>
We
were
all
equally
astonished
at
hearing
this
,
and
we
all
asked
,
<EOS>
Why
?
  
"
"
Because
the
Diamond
was
in
Miss
Rachel
's
sitting
-
room
,
"
Penelope
answered
.
<EOS>
"
And
because
I
was
the
last
person
in
the
sitting
-
room
at
night
!
"
  
"
Almost
before
the
words
had
left
her
lips
,
I
remembered
that
another
person
had
been
in
the
sitting
-
room
later
than
Penelope
.
<EOS>
That
person
was
yourself
.
<EOS>
My
head
whirled
round
,
and
my
thoughts
were
in
dreadful
confusion
.
<EOS>
In
the
midst
of
it
all
,
something
in
my
mind
whispered
to
me
that
the
smear
on
your
nightgown
might
have
a
meaning
entirely
different
to
the
meaning
which
I
had
given
to
it
up
to
that
time
.
<EOS>
"
If
the
last
person
who
was
in
the
room
is
the
person
to
be
suspected
,
"
I
thought
to
myself
,
"
the
thief
is
not
Penelope
,
but
Mr.
Franklin
Blake
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
In
the
case
of
any
other
gentleman
,
I
believe
I
should
have
been
ashamed
of
suspecting
him
of
theft
,
almost
as
soon
as
the
suspicion
had
passed
through
my
mind
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
the
bare
thought
that
YOU
had
let
yourself
down
to
my
level
,
and
that
I
,
in
possessing
myself
of
your
nightgown
,
had
also
possessed
myself
of
the
means
of
shielding
you
from
being
discovered
,
and
disgraced
for
life
 
<EOS>
I
say
,
sir
,
the
bare
thought
of
this
seemed
to
open
such
a
chance
before
me
of
winning
your
good
will
,
that
I
passed
blindfold
,
as
one
may
say
,
from
suspecting
to
believing
.
<EOS>
I
made
up
my
mind
,
on
the
spot
,
that
you
had
shown
yourself
the
busiest
of
anybody
in
fetching
the
police
,
as
a
blind
to
deceive
us
all
;
and
that
the
hand
which
had
taken
Miss
Rachel
's
jewel
could
by
no
possibility
be
any
other
hand
than
yours
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
excitement
of
this
new
discovery
of
mine
must
,
I
think
,
have
turned
my
head
for
a
while
.
<EOS>
I
felt
such
a
devouring
eagerness
to
see
you
 
to
try
you
with
a
word
or
two
about
the
Diamond
,
and
to
MAKE
you
look
at
me
,
and
speak
to
me
,
in
that
way
 
that
I
put
my
hair
tidy
,
and
made
myself
as
nice
as
I
could
,
and
went
to
you
boldly
in
the
library
where
I
knew
you
were
writing
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
had
left
one
of
your
rings
up
-
stairs
,
which
made
as
good
an
excuse
for
my
intrusion
as
I
could
have
desired
.
<EOS>
But
,
oh
,
sir
!
<EOS>
if
you
have
ever
loved
,
you
will
understand
how
it
was
that
all
my
courage
cooled
,
when
I
walked
into
the
room
,
and
found
myself
in
your
presence
.
<EOS>
And
then
,
you
looked
up
at
me
so
coldly
,
and
you
thanked
me
for
finding
your
ring
in
such
an
indifferent
manner
,
that
my
knees
trembled
under
me
,
and
I
felt
as
if
I
should
drop
on
the
floor
at
your
feet
.
<EOS>
When
you
had
thanked
me
,
you
looked
back
,
if
you
remember
,
at
your
writing
.
<EOS>
I
was
so
mortified
at
being
treated
in
this
way
<EOS>
,
that
I
plucked
up
spirit
enough
to
speak
.
<EOS>
I
said
,
"
This
is
a
strange
thing
about
the
Diamond
,
sir
.
"
<EOS>
And
you
looked
up
again
,
and
said
,
"
Yes
,
it
is
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
You
spoke
civilly
(
I
ca
n't
deny
that
)
;
but
still
you
kept
a
distance
 
a
cruel
distance
between
us
.
<EOS>
Believing
,
as
I
did
,
that
you
had
got
the
lost
Diamond
hidden
about
you
,
while
you
were
speaking
,
your
coolness
so
provoked
me
that
I
got
bold
enough
,
in
the
heat
of
the
moment
,
to
give
you
a
hint
.
<EOS>
I
said
,
"
They
will
never
find
the
Diamond
,
sir
,
will
they
?
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
nor
the
person
who
took
it
 
I
'll
answer
for
that
.
<EOS>
"
I
nodded
,
and
smiled
at
you
,
as
much
as
to
say
,
"
I
know
!
"
<EOS>
THIS
time
,
you
looked
up
at
me
with
something
like
interest
in
your
eyes
;
and
I
felt
that
a
few
more
words
on
your
side
and
mine
might
bring
out
the
truth
.
<EOS>
Just
at
that
moment
,
Mr.
Betteredge
spoilt
it
all
by
coming
to
the
door
.
<EOS>
I
knew
his
footstep
,
and
I
also
knew
that
it
was
against
his
rules
for
me
to
be
in
the
library
at
that
time
of
day
 
let
alone
being
there
along
with
you
.
<EOS>
I
had
only
just
time
to
get
out
of
my
own
accord
,
before
he
could
come
in
and
tell
me
to
go
.
<EOS>
I
was
angry
and
disappointed
;
but
I
was
not
entirely
without
hope
for
all
that
.
<EOS>
The
ice
,
you
see
,
was
broken
between
us
 
<EOS>
and
I
thought
I
would
take
care
,
on
the
next
occasion
,
that
Mr.
Betteredge
was
out
of
the
way
.
  
<EOS>
"
When
I
got
back
to
the
servants
'
hall
,
the
bell
was
going
for
our
dinner
.
<EOS>
Afternoon
already
!
<EOS>
and
the
materials
for
making
the
new
nightgown
were
still
to
be
got
!
<EOS>
There
was
but
one
chance
of
getting
them
.
<EOS>
I
shammed
ill
at
dinner
;
and
so
secured
the
whole
of
the
interval
from
then
till
tea
-
time
to
my
own
use
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
I
was
about
,
while
the
household
believed
me
to
be
lying
down
in
my
own
room
;
and
how
I
spent
the
night
,
after
shamming
ill
again
at
tea
-
time
,
and
having
been
sent
up
to
bed
,
there
is
no
need
to
tell
you
.
<EOS>
Sergeant
Cuff
discovered
that
much
,
if
he
discovered
nothing
more
.
<EOS>
And
I
can
guess
how
.
<EOS>
I
was
detected
(
though
I
kept
my
veil
down
)
in
the
draper
's
shop
at
Frizinghall
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
glass
in
front
of
me
,
at
the
counter
where
I
was
buying
the
longcloth
;
and
 
in
that
glass
 
<EOS>
I
saw
one
of
the
shopmen
point
to
my
shoulder
and
whisper
to
another
.
<EOS>
At
night
again
,
when
I
was
secretly
at
work
,
locked
into
my
room
,
I
heard
the
breathing
of
the
women
servants
who
suspected
me
,
outside
my
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
did
n't
matter
then
;
it
does
n't
matter
now
.
<EOS>
On
the
Friday
morning
,
hours
before
Sergeant
Cuff
entered
the
house
,
there
was
the
new
nightgown
 
to
make
up
your
number
in
place
of
the
nightgown
that
I
had
got
 
made
,
wrung
out
,
dried
,
ironed
,
marked
,
and
folded
as
the
laundry
woman
folded
all
the
others
,
safe
in
your
drawer
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
fear
(
if
the
linen
in
the
house
was
examined
)
of
the
newness
of
the
nightgown
betraying
me
.
<EOS>
All
your
underclothing
had
been
renewed
,
when
you
came
to
our
house
 
I
suppose
on
your
return
home
from
foreign
parts
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
next
thing
was
the
arrival
of
Sergeant
Cuff
;
and
the
next
great
surprise
was
the
announcement
of
what
HE
thought
about
the
smear
on
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
had
believed
you
to
be
guilty
(
as
I
have
owned
)
,
more
because
I
wanted
you
to
be
guilty
than
for
any
other
reason
.
<EOS>
And
now
,
the
Sergeant
had
come
round
by
a
totally
different
way
to
the
same
conclusion
(
respecting
the
nightgown
)
as
mine
!
<EOS>
And
I
had
got
the
dress
that
was
the
only
proof
against
you
!
<EOS>
And
not
a
living
creature
knew
it
 
yourself
included
!
<EOS>
I
am
afraid
to
tell
you
how
I
felt
when
I
called
these
things
to
mind
 
<EOS>
you
would
hate
my
memory
for
ever
afterwards
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
At
that
place
,
Betteredge
looked
up
from
the
letter
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
a
glimmer
of
light
so
far
,
Mr.
Franklin
,
"
said
the
old
man
,
taking
off
his
heavy
tortoiseshell
spectacles
,
and
pushing
Rosanna
Spearman
's
confession
a
little
away
from
him
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Have
you
come
to
any
conclusion
,
sir
,
in
your
own
mind
,
while
I
have
been
reading
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Finish
the
letter
first
,
Betteredge
;
there
may
be
something
to
enlighten
us
at
the
end
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
shall
have
a
word
or
two
to
say
to
you
after
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
good
,
sir
.
<EOS>
I
'll
just
rest
my
eyes
,
and
then
I
'll
go
on
again
.
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
,
Mr.
Franklin
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
want
to
hurry
you
 
<EOS>
but
would
you
mind
telling
me
,
in
one
word
,
whether
you
see
your
way
out
of
this
dreadful
mess
yet
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
see
my
way
back
to
London
,
"
I
said
,
"
to
consult
Mr.
Bruff
.
<EOS>
If
he
ca
n't
help
me
 
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
?
"
  
"
And
if
the
Sergeant
wo
n't
leave
his
retirement
at
Dorking
 
"
  
"
He
wo
n't
,
Mr.
Franklin
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
,
Betteredge
 
as
far
as
I
can
see
now
 
<EOS>
I
am
at
the
end
of
my
resources
.
<EOS>
After
Mr.
Bruff
and
the
Sergeant
,
I
do
n't
know
of
a
living
creature
who
can
be
of
the
slightest
use
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
As
the
words
passed
my
lips
,
some
person
outside
knocked
at
the
door
of
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
Betteredge
looked
surprised
as
well
as
annoyed
by
the
interruption
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
in
,
"
he
called
out
,
irritably
,
"
whoever
you
are
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
door
opened
,
and
there
entered
to
us
,
quietly
,
the
most
remarkable
-
looking
man
that
I
had
ever
seen
.
<EOS>
Judging
him
by
his
figure
and
his
movements
,
he
was
still
young
.
<EOS>
Judging
him
by
his
face
,
and
comparing
him
with
Betteredge
,
he
looked
the
elder
of
the
two
.
<EOS>
His
complexion
was
of
a
gipsy
darkness
;
his
fleshless
cheeks
had
fallen
into
deep
hollows
,
over
which
the
bone
projected
like
a
pent
-
house
.
<EOS>
His
nose
presented
the
fine
shape
and
modelling
so
often
found
among
the
ancient
people
of
the
East
,
so
seldom
visible
among
the
newer
races
of
the
West
.
<EOS>
His
forehead
rose
high
and
straight
from
the
brow
.
<EOS>
His
marks
and
wrinkles
were
innumerable
.
<EOS>
From
this
strange
face
,
eyes
,
stranger
still
,
of
the
softest
brown
 
eyes
dreamy
and
mournful
,
and
deeply
sunk
in
their
orbits
 
looked
out
at
you
,
and
(
in
my
case
,
at
least
)
took
your
attention
captive
at
their
will
.
<EOS>
Add
to
this
a
quantity
of
thick
closely
-
curling
hair
,
which
,
by
some
freak
of
Nature
,
had
lost
its
colour
in
the
most
startlingly
partial
and
capricious
manner
.
<EOS>
Over
the
top
of
his
head
it
was
still
of
the
deep
black
which
was
its
natural
colour
.
<EOS>
Round
the
sides
of
his
head
 
without
the
slightest
gradation
of
grey
to
break
the
force
of
the
extraordinary
contrast
 
it
had
turned
completely
white
.
<EOS>
The
line
between
the
two
colours
preserved
no
sort
of
regularity
.
<EOS>
At
one
place
,
the
white
hair
ran
up
into
the
black
;
at
another
,
the
black
hair
ran
down
into
the
white
.
<EOS>
I
looked
at
the
man
with
a
curiosity
which
,
I
am
ashamed
to
say
<EOS>
,
I
found
it
quite
impossible
to
control
.
<EOS>
His
soft
brown
eyes
looked
back
at
me
gently
;
and
he
met
my
involuntary
rudeness
in
staring
at
him
,
with
an
apology
which
I
was
conscious
that
I
had
not
deserved
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
had
no
idea
that
Mr.
Betteredge
was
engaged
.
"
<EOS>
He
took
a
slip
of
paper
from
his
pocket
,
and
handed
it
to
Betteredge
.
<EOS>
"
The
list
for
next
week
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
His
eyes
just
rested
on
me
again
 
<EOS>
and
he
left
the
room
as
quietly
as
he
had
entered
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Who
is
that
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Candy
's
assistant
,
"
said
Betteredge
.
<EOS>
"
By
-
the
-
bye
,
Mr.
Franklin
,
you
will
be
sorry
to
hear
that
the
little
doctor
has
never
recovered
that
illness
he
caught
,
going
home
from
the
birthday
dinner
.
<EOS>
He
's
pretty
well
in
health
;
but
he
lost
his
memory
in
the
fever
,
and
he
has
never
recovered
more
than
the
wreck
of
it
since
.
<EOS>
The
work
all
falls
on
his
assistant
.
<EOS>
Not
much
of
it
now
,
except
among
the
poor
.
<EOS>
THEY
ca
n't
help
themselves
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
THEY
must
put
up
with
the
man
with
the
piebald
hair
,
and
the
gipsy
complexion
 
or
they
would
get
no
doctoring
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
seem
to
like
him
,
Betteredge
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nobody
likes
him
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
is
he
so
unpopular
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Mr.
Franklin
,
his
appearance
is
against
him
,
to
begin
with
.
<EOS>
And
then
there
's
a
story
that
Mr.
Candy
took
him
with
a
very
doubtful
character
.
<EOS>
Nobody
knows
who
he
is
 
<EOS>
and
he
has
n't
a
friend
in
the
place
.
<EOS>
How
can
you
expect
one
to
like
him
,
after
that
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Quite
impossible
,
of
course
!
<EOS>
May
I
ask
what
he
wanted
with
you
,
when
he
gave
you
that
bit
of
paper
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Only
to
bring
me
the
weekly
list
of
the
sick
people
about
here
,
sir
,
who
stand
in
need
of
a
little
wine
.
<EOS>
My
lady
always
had
a
regular
distribution
of
good
sound
port
and
sherry
among
the
infirm
poor
;
and
Miss
Rachel
wishes
the
custom
to
be
kept
up
.
<EOS>
Times
have
changed
!
<EOS>
times
have
changed
!
<EOS>
I
remember
when
Mr.
Candy
himself
brought
the
list
to
my
mistress
.
<EOS>
Now
it
's
Mr.
Candy
's
assistant
who
brings
the
list
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
'll
go
on
with
the
letter
,
if
you
will
allow
me
,
sir
,
"
said
Betteredge
,
drawing
Rosanna
Spearman
's
confession
back
to
him
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
n't
lively
reading
,
I
grant
you
.
<EOS>
But
,
there
!
<EOS>
it
keeps
me
from
getting
sour
with
thinking
of
the
past
.
"
<EOS>
He
put
on
his
spectacles
,
and
wagged
his
head
gloomily
.
<EOS>
"
There
's
a
bottom
of
good
sense
,
Mr.
Franklin
,
in
our
conduct
to
our
mothers
,
when
they
first
start
us
on
the
journey
of
life
.
<EOS>
We
are
all
of
us
more
or
less
unwilling
to
be
brought
into
the
world
.
<EOS>
And
we
are
all
of
us
right
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Candy
's
assistant
had
produced
too
strong
an
impression
on
me
to
be
immediately
dismissed
from
my
thoughts
.
<EOS>
I
passed
over
the
last
unanswerable
utterance
of
the
Betteredge
philosophy
;
and
returned
to
the
subject
of
the
man
with
the
piebald
hair
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
his
name
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
As
ugly
a
name
as
need
be
,
"
Betteredge
answered
gruffly
.
"
<EOS>
Ezra
Jennings
.
<EOS>
"
    
<EOS>
Having
told
me
the
name
of
Mr.
Candy
's
assistant
,
Betteredge
appeared
to
think
that
we
had
wasted
enough
of
our
time
on
an
insignificant
subject
.
<EOS>
He
resumed
the
perusal
of
Rosanna
Spearman
's
letter
.
  
<EOS>
On
my
side
,
I
sat
at
the
window
,
waiting
until
he
had
done
.
<EOS>
Little
by
little
,
the
impression
produced
on
me
by
Ezra
Jennings
 
<EOS>
it
seemed
perfectly
unaccountable
,
in
such
a
situation
as
mine
,
that
any
human
being
should
have
produced
an
impression
on
me
at
all
!
 
<EOS>
faded
from
my
mind
.
<EOS>
My
thoughts
flowed
back
into
their
former
channel
.
<EOS>
Once
more
,
I
forced
myself
to
look
my
own
incredible
position
resolutely
in
the
face
.
<EOS>
Once
more
,
I
reviewed
in
my
own
mind
the
course
which
I
had
at
last
summoned
composure
enough
to
plan
out
for
the
future
.
  
<EOS>
To
go
back
to
London
that
day
;
to
put
the
whole
case
before
Mr.
Bruff
;
and
,
last
and
most
important
,
to
obtain
(
no
matter
by
what
means
or
at
what
sacrifice
)
a
personal
interview
with
Rachel
 
<EOS>
this
was
my
plan
of
action
,
so
far
as
I
was
capable
of
forming
it
at
the
time
.
<EOS>
There
was
more
than
an
hour
still
to
spare
before
the
train
started
.
<EOS>
And
there
was
the
bare
chance
that
Betteredge
might
discover
something
in
the
unread
portion
of
Rosanna
Spearman
's
letter
,
which
it
might
be
useful
for
me
to
know
before
I
left
the
house
in
which
the
Diamond
had
been
lost
.
<EOS>
For
that
chance
I
was
now
waiting
.
  
<EOS>
The
letter
ended
in
these
terms
:
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
no
need
to
be
angry
,
Mr.
Franklin
,
even
if
I
did
feel
some
little
triumph
at
knowing
that
I
held
all
your
prospects
in
life
in
my
own
hands
.
<EOS>
Anxieties
and
fears
soon
came
back
to
me
.
<EOS>
With
the
view
Sergeant
Cuff
took
of
the
loss
of
the
Diamond
,
he
would
be
sure
to
end
in
examining
our
linen
and
our
dresses
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
place
in
my
room
 
<EOS>
there
was
no
place
in
the
house
 
<EOS>
which
I
could
feel
satisfied
would
be
safe
from
him
.
<EOS>
How
to
hide
the
nightgown
so
that
not
even
the
Sergeant
could
find
it
?
<EOS>
and
how
to
do
that
without
losing
one
moment
of
precious
time
?
 
<EOS>
these
were
not
easy
questions
to
answer
.
<EOS>
My
uncertainties
ended
in
my
taking
a
way
that
may
make
you
laugh
.
<EOS>
I
undressed
,
and
put
the
nightgown
on
me
.
<EOS>
You
had
worn
it
 
<EOS>
and
I
had
another
little
moment
of
pleasure
in
wearing
it
after
you
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
next
news
that
reached
us
in
the
servants
'
hall
showed
that
I
had
not
made
sure
of
the
nightgown
a
moment
too
soon
.
<EOS>
Sergeant
Cuff
wanted
to
see
the
washing
-
book
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
found
it
,
and
took
it
to
him
in
my
lady
's
sitting
-
room
.
<EOS>
The
Sergeant
and
I
had
come
across
each
other
more
than
once
in
former
days
.
<EOS>
I
was
certain
he
would
know
me
again
 
<EOS>
and
I
was
NOT
certain
of
what
he
might
do
when
he
found
me
employed
as
servant
in
a
house
in
which
a
valuable
jewel
had
been
lost
.
<EOS>
In
this
suspense
,
I
felt
it
would
be
a
relief
to
me
to
get
the
meeting
between
us
over
,
and
to
know
the
worst
of
it
at
once
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
looked
at
me
as
if
I
was
a
stranger
,
when
I
handed
him
the
washing
-
book
;
and
he
was
very
specially
polite
in
thanking
me
for
bringing
it
.
<EOS>
I
thought
those
were
both
bad
signs
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
knowing
what
he
might
say
of
me
behind
my
back
;
there
was
no
knowing
how
soon
I
might
not
find
myself
taken
in
custody
on
suspicion
,
and
searched
.
<EOS>
It
was
then
time
for
your
return
from
seeing
Mr.
Godfrey
Ablewhite
off
by
the
railway
;
and
I
went
to
your
favourite
walk
in
the
shrubbery
,
to
try
for
another
chance
of
speaking
to
you
 
the
last
chance
,
for
all
I
knew
to
the
contrary
,
that
I
might
have
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
never
appeared
;
and
,
what
was
worse
still
,
Mr.
Betteredge
and
Sergeant
Cuff
passed
by
the
place
where
I
was
hiding
 
and
<EOS>
the
Sergeant
saw
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
had
no
choice
,
after
that
,
but
to
return
to
my
proper
place
and
my
proper
work
,
before
more
disasters
happened
to
me
.
<EOS>
Just
as
I
was
going
to
step
across
the
path
,
you
came
back
from
the
railway
.
<EOS>
You
were
making
straight
for
the
shrubbery
,
when
you
saw
me
 
I
am
certain
,
<EOS>
sir
,
you
saw
me
 
<EOS>
and
you
turned
away
as
if
I
had
got
the
plague
,
and
went
into
the
house
.

NOTE
:
by
Franklin
Blake
.
 
<EOS>
The
writer
is
entirely
mistaken
,
poor
creature
.
<EOS>
I
never
noticed
her
.
<EOS>
My
intention
was
certainly
to
have
taken
a
turn
in
the
shrubbery
.
<EOS>
But
,
remembering
at
the
same
moment
that
my
aunt
might
wish
to
see
me
,
after
my
return
from
the
railway
,
I
altered
my
mind
,
and
went
into
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
made
the
best
of
my
way
indoors
again
,
returning
by
the
servants
'
entrance
.
<EOS>
There
was
nobody
in
the
laundry
-
room
at
that
time
;
and
I
sat
down
there
alone
.
<EOS>
I
have
told
you
already
of
the
thoughts
which
the
Shivering
Sand
put
into
my
head
.
<EOS>
Those
thoughts
came
back
to
me
now
.
<EOS>
I
wondered
in
myself
which
it
would
be
harder
to
do
,
if
things
went
on
in
this
manner
 
to
bear
Mr.
Franklin
Blake
's
indifference
to
me
,
or
to
jump
into
the
quicksand
and
end
it
for
ever
in
that
way
?
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
useless
to
ask
me
to
account
for
my
own
conduct
,
at
this
time
.
<EOS>
I
try
 
and
I
ca
n't
understand
it
myself
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
did
n't
I
stop
you
,
when
you
avoided
me
in
that
cruel
manner
?
<EOS>
Why
did
n't
I
call
out
,
"
Mr.
Franklin
,
I
have
got
something
to
say
to
you
;
it
concerns
yourself
,
and
you
must
,
and
shall
,
hear
it
?
<EOS>
"
You
were
at
my
mercy
 
<EOS>
I
had
got
the
whip
-
hand
of
you
,
as
they
say
.
<EOS>
And
better
than
that
,
I
had
the
means
(
if
I
could
only
make
you
trust
me
)
of
being
useful
to
you
in
the
future
.
<EOS>
Of
course
,
I
never
supposed
that
you
 
a
gentleman
 
had
stolen
the
Diamond
for
the
mere
pleasure
of
stealing
it
.
<EOS>
No
.
<EOS>
Penelope
had
heard
Miss
Rachel
,
and
I
had
heard
Mr.
Betteredge
,
talk
about
your
extravagance
and
your
debts
.
<EOS>
It
was
plain
enough
to
me
that
you
had
taken
the
Diamond
to
sell
it
,
or
pledge
it
,
and
so
to
get
the
money
of
which
you
stood
in
need
.
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
I
could
have
told
you
of
a
man
in
London
who
would
have
advanced
a
good
large
sum
on
the
jewel
,
and
who
would
have
asked
no
awkward
questions
about
it
either
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
did
n't
I
speak
to
you
!
<EOS>
why
did
n't
I
speak
to
you
!
  
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
whether
the
risks
and
difficulties
of
keeping
the
nightgown
were
as
much
as
I
could
manage
,
without
having
other
risks
and
difficulties
added
to
them
?
<EOS>
This
might
have
been
the
case
with
some
women
 
<EOS>
but
how
could
it
be
the
case
with
me
?
<EOS>
In
the
days
when
I
was
a
thief
,
I
had
run
fifty
times
greater
risks
,
and
found
my
way
out
of
difficulties
to
which
THIS
difficulty
was
mere
child
's
play
.
<EOS>
I
had
been
apprenticed
,
as
you
may
say
,
to
frauds
and
deceptions
 
some
of
them
on
such
a
grand
scale
,
and
managed
so
cleverly
,
that
they
became
famous
,
and
appeared
in
the
newspapers
.
<EOS>
Was
such
a
little
thing
as
the
keeping
of
the
nightgown
likely
to
weigh
on
my
spirits
,
and
to
set
my
heart
sinking
within
me
,
at
the
time
when
I
ought
to
have
spoken
to
you
?
<EOS>
What
nonsense
to
ask
the
question
!
<EOS>
The
thing
could
n't
be
.
  
<EOS>
"
Where
is
the
use
of
my
dwelling
in
this
way
on
my
own
folly
?
<EOS>
The
plain
truth
is
plain
enough
,
surely
?
<EOS>
Behind
your
back
,
I
loved
you
with
all
my
heart
and
soul
.
<EOS>
Before
your
face
 
there
's
no
denying
it
 
<EOS>
I
was
frightened
of
you
;
frightened
of
making
you
angry
with
me
;
frightened
of
what
you
might
say
to
me
(
though
you
HAD
taken
the
Diamond
)
if
I
presumed
to
tell
you
that
I
had
found
it
out
.
<EOS>
I
had
gone
as
near
to
it
as
I
dared
when
I
spoke
to
you
in
the
library
.
<EOS>
You
had
not
turned
your
back
on
me
then
.
<EOS>
You
had
not
started
away
from
me
as
if
I
had
got
the
plague
.
<EOS>
I
tried
to
provoke
myself
into
feeling
angry
with
you
,
and
to
rouse
up
my
courage
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
I
could
n't
feel
anything
but
the
misery
and
the
mortification
of
it
.
<EOS>
You
're
a
plain
girl
;
you
have
got
a
crooked
shoulder
;
you
're
only
a
housemaid
 
<EOS>
what
do
you
mean
by
attempting
to
speak
to
Me
?
<EOS>
"
You
never
uttered
a
word
of
that
,
Mr.
Franklin
;
but
you
said
it
all
to
me
,
nevertheless
!
<EOS>
Is
such
madness
as
this
to
be
accounted
for
?
<EOS>
No
.
<EOS>
There
is
nothing
to
be
done
but
to
confess
it
,
and
let
it
be
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
ask
your
pardon
,
once
more
,
for
this
wandering
of
my
pen
.
<EOS>
There
is
no
fear
of
its
happening
again
.
<EOS>
I
am
close
at
the
end
now
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
first
person
who
disturbed
me
by
coming
into
the
empty
room
was
Penelope
.
<EOS>
She
had
found
out
my
secret
long
since
,
and
she
had
done
her
best
to
bring
me
to
my
senses
 
and
done
it
kindly
too
.
  
<EOS>
"
"
Ah
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
"
I
know
why
you
're
sitting
here
,
and
fretting
,
all
by
yourself
.
<EOS>
The
best
thing
that
can
happen
for
your
advantage
,
Rosanna
,
will
be
for
Mr.
Franklin
's
visit
here
to
come
to
an
end
.
<EOS>
It
's
my
belief
that
he
wo
n't
be
long
now
before
he
leaves
the
house
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
In
all
my
thoughts
of
you
<EOS>
I
had
never
thought
of
your
going
away
.
<EOS>
I
could
n't
speak
to
Penelope
.
<EOS>
I
could
only
look
at
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
"
I
've
just
left
Miss
Rachel
,
"
Penelope
went
on
.
"
<EOS>
And
a
hard
matter
I
have
had
of
it
to
put
up
with
her
temper
.
<EOS>
She
says
the
house
is
unbearable
to
her
with
the
police
in
it
;
and
she
's
determined
to
speak
to
my
lady
this
evening
,
and
to
go
to
her
Aunt
Ablewhite
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
If
she
does
that
,
Mr.
Franklin
will
be
the
next
to
find
a
reason
for
going
away
,
you
may
depend
on
it
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
recovered
the
use
of
my
tongue
at
that
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Do
you
mean
to
say
Mr.
Franklin
will
go
with
her
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
"
Only
too
gladly
,
if
she
would
let
him
;
but
she
wo
n't
.
<EOS>
HE
has
been
made
to
feel
her
temper
;
HE
is
in
her
black
books
too
 
and
that
after
having
done
all
he
can
to
help
her
,
poor
fellow
!
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
no
!
<EOS>
If
they
do
n't
make
it
up
before
to
-
morrow
,
you
will
see
Miss
Rachel
go
one
way
,
and
Mr.
Franklin
another
.
<EOS>
Where
he
may
betake
himself
to
I
ca
n't
say
.
<EOS>
But
he
will
never
stay
here
,
Rosanna
,
after
Miss
Rachel
has
left
us
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
managed
to
master
the
despair
I
felt
at
the
prospect
of
your
going
away
.
<EOS>
To
own
the
truth
,
I
saw
a
little
glimpse
of
hope
for
myself
if
there
was
really
a
serious
disagreement
between
Miss
Rachel
and
you
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Do
you
know
,
"
I
asked
,
"
what
the
quarrel
is
between
them
?
"
  
"
"
It
is
all
on
Miss
Rachel
's
side
,
"
Penelope
said
.
<EOS>
"
And
,
for
anything
I
know
to
the
contrary
,
it
's
all
Miss
Rachel
's
temper
,
and
nothing
else
.
<EOS>
I
am
loth
to
distress
you
,
Rosanna
;
but
do
n't
run
away
with
the
notion
that
Mr.
Franklin
is
ever
likely
to
quarrel
with
HER
.
<EOS>
He
's
a
great
deal
too
fond
of
her
for
that
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
had
only
just
spoken
those
cruel
words
when
there
came
a
call
to
us
from
Mr.
Betteredge
.
<EOS>
All
the
indoor
servants
were
to
assemble
in
the
hall
.
<EOS>
And
then
we
were
to
go
in
,
one
by
one
,
and
be
questioned
in
Mr.
Betteredge
's
room
by
Sergeant
Cuff
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
came
to
my
turn
to
go
in
,
after
her
ladyship
's
maid
and
the
upper
housemaid
had
been
questioned
first
.
<EOS>
Sergeant
Cuff
's
inquiries
 
though
he
wrapped
them
up
very
cunningly
 
soon
showed
me
that
those
two
women
(
the
bitterest
enemies
I
had
in
the
house
)
had
made
their
discoveries
outside
my
door
,
on
the
Tuesday
afternoon
,
and
again
on
the
Thursday
night
.
<EOS>
They
had
told
the
Sergeant
enough
to
open
his
eyes
to
some
part
of
the
truth
.
<EOS>
He
rightly
believed
me
to
have
made
a
new
nightgown
secretly
,
but
he
wrongly
believed
the
paint
-
stained
nightgown
to
be
mine
.
<EOS>
I
felt
satisfied
of
another
thing
,
from
what
he
said
,
which
it
puzzled
me
to
understand
.
<EOS>
He
suspected
me
,
of
course
,
of
being
concerned
in
the
disappearance
of
the
Diamond
.
<EOS>
But
,
at
the
same
time
,
he
let
me
see
 
purposely
,
as
I
thought
 
that
he
did
not
consider
me
as
the
person
chiefly
answerable
for
the
loss
of
the
jewel
.
<EOS>
He
appeared
to
think
that
I
had
been
acting
under
the
direction
of
somebody
else
.
<EOS>
Who
that
person
might
be
,
I
could
n't
guess
then
,
and
ca
n't
guess
now
.
  
<EOS>
"
In
this
uncertainty
,
one
thing
was
plain
 
that
Sergeant
Cuff
was
miles
away
from
knowing
the
whole
truth
.
<EOS>
You
were
safe
as
long
as
the
nightgown
was
safe
 
and
not
a
moment
longer
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
quite
despair
of
making
you
understand
the
distress
and
terror
which
pressed
upon
me
now
.
<EOS>
It
was
impossible
for
me
to
risk
wearing
your
nightgown
any
longer
.
<EOS>
I
might
find
myself
taken
off
,
at
a
moment
's
notice
,
to
the
police
court
at
Frizinghall
,
to
be
charged
on
suspicion
,
and
searched
accordingly
.
<EOS>
While
Sergeant
Cuff
still
left
me
free
,
I
had
to
choose
 
and
at
once
 
between
destroying
the
nightgown
,
or
hiding
it
in
some
safe
place
,
at
some
safe
distance
from
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
had
only
been
a
little
less
fond
of
you
,
I
think
I
should
have
destroyed
it
.
<EOS>
But
oh
!
<EOS>
how
could
I
destroy
the
only
thing
I
had
which
proved
that
I
had
saved
you
from
discovery
?
<EOS>
If
we
did
come
to
an
explanation
together
,
and
if
you
suspected
me
of
having
some
bad
motive
,
and
denied
it
all
<EOS>
,
how
could
I
win
upon
you
to
trust
me
,
unless
I
had
the
nightgown
to
produce
?
<EOS>
Was
it
wronging
you
to
believe
,
as
I
did
and
do
still
,
that
you
might
hesitate
to
let
a
poor
girl
like
me
be
the
sharer
of
your
secret
,
and
your
accomplice
in
the
theft
which
your
money
-
troubles
had
tempted
you
to
commit
?
<EOS>
Think
of
your
cold
behaviour
to
me
,
sir
,
and
you
will
hardly
wonder
at
my
unwillingness
to
destroy
the
only
claim
on
your
confidence
and
your
gratitude
which
it
was
my
fortune
to
possess
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
determined
to
hide
it
;
and
the
place
I
fixed
on
was
the
place
I
knew
best
 
the
Shivering
Sand
.
  
<EOS>
"
As
soon
as
the
questioning
was
over
,
I
made
the
first
excuse
that
came
into
my
head
,
and
got
leave
to
go
out
for
a
breath
of
fresh
air
.
<EOS>
I
went
straight
to
Cobb
's
Hole
,
to
Mr.
Yolland
's
cottage
.
<EOS>
His
wife
and
daughter
were
the
best
friends
I
had
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
suppose
I
trusted
them
with
your
secret
 
I
have
trusted
nobody
.
<EOS>
All
I
wanted
was
to
write
this
letter
to
you
,
and
to
have
a
safe
opportunity
of
taking
the
nightgown
off
me
.
<EOS>
Suspected
as
I
was
,
I
could
do
neither
of
those
things
with
any
sort
of
security
,
at
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
now
I
have
nearly
got
through
my
long
letter
,
writing
it
alone
in
Lucy
Yolland
's
bedroom
.
<EOS>
When
it
is
done
,
I
shall
go
downstairs
with
the
nightgown
rolled
up
,
and
hidden
under
my
cloak
.
<EOS>
I
shall
find
the
means
I
want
for
keeping
it
safe
and
dry
in
its
hiding
-
place
,
among
the
litter
of
old
things
in
Mrs.
Yolland
's
kitchen
.
<EOS>
And
then
I
shall
go
to
the
Shivering
Sand
 
<EOS>
do
n't
be
afraid
of
my
letting
my
footmarks
betray
me
!
 
and
hide
the
nightgown
down
in
the
sand
,
where
no
living
creature
can
find
it
without
being
first
let
into
the
secret
by
myself
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
,
when
that
's
done
,
what
then
?
  
<EOS>
"
Then
,
Mr.
Franklin
,
I
shall
have
two
reasons
for
making
another
attempt
to
say
the
words
to
you
which
I
have
not
said
yet
.
<EOS>
If
you
leave
the
house
,
as
Penelope
believes
you
will
leave
it
,
and
if
I
have
n't
spoken
to
you
before
that
,
I
shall
lose
my
opportunity
forever
.
<EOS>
That
is
one
reason
.
<EOS>
Then
,
again
,
there
is
the
comforting
knowledge
 
if
my
speaking
does
make
you
angry
 
that
I
have
got
the
nightgown
ready
to
plead
my
cause
for
me
as
nothing
else
can
.
<EOS>
That
is
my
other
reason
.
<EOS>
If
these
two
together
do
n't
harden
my
heart
against
the
coldness
which
has
hitherto
frozen
it
up
<EOS>
(
I
mean
the
coldness
of
your
treatment
of
me
)
,
there
will
be
the
end
of
my
efforts
 
and
the
end
of
my
life
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
If
I
miss
my
next
opportunity
 
if
you
are
as
cruel
as
ever
,
and
if
I
feel
it
again
as
I
have
felt
it
already
 
good
-
bye
to
the
world
which
has
grudged
me
the
happiness
that
it
gives
to
others
.
<EOS>
Good
-
bye
to
life
,
which
nothing
but
a
little
kindness
from
you
can
ever
make
pleasurable
to
me
again
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
blame
yourself
,
sir
,
if
it
ends
in
this
way
.
<EOS>
But
try
 
do
try
 
to
feel
some
forgiving
sorrow
for
me
!
<EOS>
I
shall
take
care
that
you
find
out
what
I
have
done
for
you
,
when
I
am
past
telling
you
of
it
myself
.
<EOS>
Will
you
say
something
kind
of
me
then
 
in
the
same
gentle
way
that
you
have
when
you
speak
to
Miss
Rachel
?
<EOS>
If
you
do
that
,
and
if
there
are
such
things
as
ghosts
,
I
believe
my
ghost
will
hear
it
,
and
tremble
with
the
pleasure
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
time
I
left
off
.
<EOS>
I
am
making
myself
cry
.
<EOS>
How
am
I
to
see
my
way
to
the
hiding
-
place
if
I
let
these
useless
tears
come
and
blind
me
?
  
<EOS>
"
Besides
,
why
should
I
look
at
the
gloomy
side
?
<EOS>
Why
not
believe
,
while
I
can
,
that
it
will
end
well
after
all
?
<EOS>
I
may
find
you
in
a
good
humour
to
-
night
 
or
,
if
not
,
I
may
succeed
better
to
-
morrow
morning
.
<EOS>
I
sha'n't
improve
my
plain
face
by
fretting
 
<EOS>
shall
I
?
<EOS>
Who
knows
but
I
may
have
filled
all
these
weary
long
pages
of
paper
for
nothing
?
<EOS>
They
will
go
,
for
safety
's
sake
<EOS>
(
never
mind
now
for
what
other
reason
)
into
the
hiding
-
place
along
with
the
nightgown
.
<EOS>
It
has
been
hard
,
hard
work
writing
my
letter
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
if
we
only
end
in
understanding
each
other
,
how
I
shall
enjoy
tearing
it
up
!
  
<EOS>
"
I
beg
to
remain
,
sir
,
your
true
lover
and
humble
servant
,
  
"
ROSANNA
SPEARMAN
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
reading
of
the
letter
was
completed
by
Betteredge
in
silence
.
<EOS>
After
carefully
putting
it
back
in
the
envelope
,
he
sat
thinking
,
with
his
head
bowed
down
,
and
his
eyes
on
the
ground
.
  
<EOS>
"
Betteredge
,
"
I
said
,
"
is
there
any
hint
to
guide
me
at
the
end
of
the
letter
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
looked
up
slowly
,
with
a
heavy
sigh
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
nothing
to
guide
you
,
Mr.
Franklin
,
"
he
answered
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
take
my
advice
you
will
keep
the
letter
in
the
cover
till
these
present
anxieties
of
yours
have
come
to
an
end
.
<EOS>
It
will
sorely
distress
you
,
whenever
you
read
it
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
read
it
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
put
the
letter
away
in
my
pocket
-
book
.
  
<EOS>
A
glance
back
at
the
sixteenth
and
seventeenth
chapters
of
Betteredge
's
Narrative
will
show
that
there
really
was
a
reason
for
my
thus
sparing
myself
,
at
a
time
when
my
fortitude
had
been
already
cruelly
tried
.
<EOS>
Twice
over
,
the
unhappy
woman
had
made
her
last
attempt
to
speak
to
me
.
<EOS>
And
twice
over
,
it
had
been
my
misfortune
(
God
knows
how
innocently
!
)
to
repel
the
advances
she
had
made
to
me
.
<EOS>
On
the
Friday
night
,
as
Betteredge
truly
describes
it
,
she
had
found
me
alone
at
the
billiard
-
table
.
<EOS>
Her
manner
and
language
suggested
to
me
and
would
have
suggested
to
any
man
,
under
the
circumstances
 
that
she
was
about
to
confess
a
guilty
knowledge
of
the
disappearance
of
the
Diamond
.
<EOS>
For
her
own
sake
,
I
had
purposely
shown
no
special
interest
in
what
was
coming
;
for
her
own
sake
,
I
had
purposely
looked
at
the
billiard
-
balls
,
instead
of
looking
at
HER
 
and
what
had
been
the
result
?
<EOS>
I
had
sent
her
away
from
me
,
wounded
to
the
heart
!
<EOS>
On
the
Saturday
again
 
on
the
day
when
she
must
have
foreseen
,
after
what
Penelope
had
told
her
,
that
my
departure
was
close
at
hand
 
<EOS>
the
same
fatality
still
pursued
us
.
<EOS>
She
had
once
more
attempted
to
meet
me
in
the
shrubbery
walk
,
and
she
had
found
me
there
in
company
with
Betteredge
and
Sergeant
Cuff
.
<EOS>
In
her
hearing
,
the
Sergeant
,
with
his
own
underhand
object
in
view
,
had
appealed
to
my
interest
in
Rosanna
Spearman
.
<EOS>
Again
for
the
poor
creature
's
own
sake
,
I
had
met
the
police
-
officer
with
a
flat
denial
,
and
had
declared
 
loudly
declared
,
so
that
she
might
hear
me
too
 
that
I
felt
"
no
interest
whatever
in
Rosanna
Spearman
.
<EOS>
"
At
those
words
,
solely
designed
to
warn
her
against
attempting
to
gain
my
private
ear
,
she
had
turned
away
and
left
the
place
:
cautioned
of
her
danger
,
as
I
then
believed
;
self
-
doomed
to
destruction
,
as
I
know
now
.
<EOS>
From
that
point
,
I
have
already
traced
the
succession
of
events
which
led
me
to
the
astounding
discovery
at
the
quicksand
.
<EOS>
The
retrospect
is
now
complete
.
<EOS>
I
may
leave
the
miserable
story
of
Rosanna
Spearman
 
to
which
,
even
at
this
distance
of
time
,
I
can
not
revert
without
a
pang
of
distress
 
to
suggest
for
itself
all
that
is
here
purposely
left
unsaid
.
<EOS>
I
may
pass
from
the
suicide
at
the
Shivering
Sand
,
with
its
strange
and
terrible
influence
on
my
present
position
and
future
prospects
,
to
interests
which
concern
the
living
people
of
this
narrative
,
and
to
events
which
were
already
paving
my
way
for
the
slow
and
toilsome
journey
from
the
darkness
to
the
light
.
    
<EOS>
I
walked
to
the
railway
station
accompanied
,
it
is
needless
to
say
,
by
Gabriel
Betteredge
.
<EOS>
I
had
the
letter
in
my
pocket
,
and
the
nightgown
safely
packed
in
a
little
bag
 
both
to
be
submitted
,
before
I
slept
that
night
,
to
the
investigation
of
Mr.
Bruff
.
  
<EOS>
We
left
the
house
in
silence
.
<EOS>
For
the
first
time
in
my
experience
of
him
,
I
found
old
Betteredge
in
my
company
without
a
word
to
say
to
me
.
<EOS>
Having
something
to
say
on
my
side
,
I
opened
the
conversation
as
soon
as
we
were
clear
of
the
lodge
gates
.
  
<EOS>
"
Before
I
go
to
London
,
"
I
began
,
"
I
have
two
questions
to
ask
you
.
<EOS>
They
relate
to
myself
,
and
I
believe
they
will
rather
surprise
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
they
will
put
that
poor
creature
's
letter
out
of
my
head
,
Mr.
Franklin
,
they
may
do
anything
else
they
like
with
me
.
<EOS>
Please
to
begin
surprising
me
,
sir
,
as
soon
as
you
can
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
first
question
,
Betteredge
,
is
this
.
<EOS>
Was
I
drunk
on
the
night
of
Rachel
's
Birthday
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
YOU
drunk
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
the
old
man
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Why
it
's
the
great
defect
of
your
character
,
Mr.
Franklin
that
you
only
drink
with
your
dinner
,
and
never
touch
a
drop
of
liquor
afterwards
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
the
birthday
was
a
special
occasion
.
<EOS>
I
might
have
abandoned
my
regular
habits
,
on
that
night
of
all
others
.
"
  
<EOS>
Betteredge
considered
for
a
moment
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
did
go
out
of
your
habits
,
sir
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
And
I
'll
tell
you
how
.
<EOS>
You
looked
wretchedly
ill
 
<EOS>
and
we
persuaded
you
to
have
a
drop
of
brandy
and
water
to
cheer
you
up
a
little
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
used
to
brandy
and
water
.
<EOS>
It
is
quite
possible
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
Wait
a
bit
,
Mr.
Franklin
.
<EOS>
I
knew
you
were
not
used
,
too
.
<EOS>
I
poured
you
out
half
a
wineglass
-
full
of
our
fifty
year
old
Cognac
;
and
(
more
shame
for
me
!
)
<EOS>
I
drowned
that
noble
liquor
in
nigh
on
a
tumbler
-
full
of
cold
water
.
<EOS>
A
child
could
n't
have
got
drunk
on
it
 
<EOS>
let
alone
a
grown
man
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
knew
I
could
depend
on
his
memory
,
in
a
matter
of
this
kind
.
<EOS>
It
was
plainly
impossible
that
I
could
have
been
intoxicated
.
<EOS>
I
passed
on
to
the
second
question
.
  
<EOS>
"
Before
I
was
sent
abroad
,
Betteredge
,
you
saw
a
great
deal
of
me
when
I
was
a
boy
?
<EOS>
Now
tell
me
plainly
,
do
you
remember
anything
strange
of
me
,
after
I
had
gone
to
bed
at
night
?
<EOS>
Did
you
ever
discover
me
walking
in
my
sleep
?
"
  
<EOS>
Betteredge
stopped
,
looked
at
me
for
a
moment
,
nodded
his
head
,
and
walked
on
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
see
your
drift
now
,
Mr.
Franklin
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
"
You
're
trying
to
account
for
how
you
got
the
paint
on
your
nightgown
,
without
knowing
it
yourself
.
<EOS>
It
wo
n't
do
,
sir
.
<EOS>
You
're
miles
away
still
from
getting
at
the
truth
.
<EOS>
Walk
in
your
sleep
?
<EOS>
You
never
did
such
a
thing
in
your
life
!
"
  
<EOS>
Here
again
,
I
felt
that
Betteredge
must
be
right
.
<EOS>
Neither
at
home
nor
abroad
had
my
life
ever
been
of
the
solitary
sort
.
<EOS>
If
I
had
been
a
sleep
-
walker
,
there
were
hundreds
on
hundreds
of
people
who
must
have
discovered
me
,
and
who
,
in
the
interest
of
my
own
safety
,
would
have
warned
me
of
the
habit
,
and
have
taken
precautions
to
restrain
it
.
  
<EOS>
Still
,
admitting
all
this
,
I
clung
 
with
an
obstinacy
which
was
surely
natural
and
excusable
,
under
the
circumstances
 
to
one
or
other
of
the
only
two
explanations
that
I
could
see
which
accounted
for
the
unendurable
position
in
which
I
then
stood
.
<EOS>
Observing
that
I
was
not
yet
satisfied
,
Betteredge
shrewdly
adverted
to
certain
later
events
in
the
history
of
the
Moonstone
;
and
scattered
both
my
theories
to
the
wind
at
once
and
for
ever
.
  
<EOS>
"
Let
's
try
it
another
way
,
sir
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
Keep
your
own
opinion
,
and
see
how
far
it
will
take
you
towards
finding
out
the
truth
.
<EOS>
If
we
are
to
believe
the
nightgown
 
<EOS>
which
I
do
n't
for
one
 
<EOS>
you
not
only
smeared
off
the
paint
from
the
door
,
without
knowing
it
,
but
you
also
took
the
Diamond
without
knowing
it
.
<EOS>
Is
that
right
,
so
far
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Quite
right
.
<EOS>
Go
on
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
good
,
sir
.
<EOS>
We
'll
say
you
were
drunk
,
or
walking
in
your
sleep
,
when
you
took
the
jewel
.
<EOS>
That
accounts
for
the
night
and
morning
,
after
the
birthday
.
<EOS>
But
how
does
it
account
for
what
has
happened
since
that
time
?
<EOS>
The
Diamond
has
been
taken
to
London
,
since
that
time
.
<EOS>
The
Diamond
has
been
pledged
to
Mr.
Luker
,
since
that
time
.
<EOS>
Did
you
do
those
two
things
,
without
knowing
it
,
too
?
<EOS>
Were
you
drunk
when
I
saw
you
off
in
the
pony
-
chaise
on
that
Saturday
evening
?
<EOS>
And
did
you
walk
in
your
sleep
to
Mr.
Luker
's
,
when
the
train
had
brought
you
to
your
journey
's
end
?
<EOS>
Excuse
me
for
saying
it
,
Mr.
Franklin
,
but
this
business
has
so
upset
you
,
that
you
're
not
fit
yet
to
judge
for
yourself
.
<EOS>
The
sooner
you
lay
your
head
alongside
Mr.
Bruff
's
head
,
the
sooner
you
will
see
your
way
out
of
the
dead
-
lock
that
has
got
you
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
We
reached
the
station
,
with
only
a
minute
or
two
to
spare
.
  
<EOS>
I
hurriedly
gave
Betteredge
my
address
in
London
,
so
that
he
might
write
to
me
,
if
necessary
;
promising
,
on
my
side
,
to
inform
him
of
any
news
which
I
might
have
to
communicate
.
<EOS>
This
done
,
and
just
as
I
was
bidding
him
farewell
,
I
happened
to
glance
towards
the
book
-
and
-
newspaper
stall
.
<EOS>
There
was
Mr.
Candy
's
remarkable
-
looking
assistant
again
,
speaking
to
the
keeper
of
the
stall
!
<EOS>
Our
eyes
met
at
the
same
moment
.
<EOS>
Ezra
Jennings
took
off
his
hat
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
returned
the
salute
,
and
got
into
a
carriage
just
as
the
train
started
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
relief
to
my
mind
,
I
suppose
,
to
dwell
on
any
subject
which
appeared
to
be
,
personally
,
of
no
sort
of
importance
to
me
.
<EOS>
At
all
events
,
I
began
the
momentous
journey
back
which
was
to
take
me
to
Mr.
Bruff
,
wondering
 
absurdly
enough
,
I
admit
 
that
I
should
have
seen
the
man
with
the
piebald
hair
twice
in
one
day
!
  
<EOS>
The
hour
at
which
I
arrived
in
London
precluded
all
hope
of
my
finding
Mr.
Bruff
at
his
place
of
business
.
<EOS>
I
drove
from
the
railway
to
his
private
residence
at
Hampstead
,
and
disturbed
the
old
lawyer
dozing
alone
in
his
dining
-
room
,
with
his
favourite
pug
-
dog
on
his
lap
,
and
his
bottle
of
wine
at
his
elbow
.
  
<EOS>
I
shall
best
describe
the
effect
which
my
story
produced
on
the
mind
of
Mr.
Bruff
by
relating
his
proceedings
when
he
had
heard
it
to
the
end
.
<EOS>
He
ordered
lights
,
and
strong
tea
,
to
be
taken
into
his
study
;
and
he
sent
a
message
to
the
ladies
of
his
family
,
forbidding
them
to
disturb
us
on
any
pretence
whatever
.
<EOS>
These
preliminaries
disposed
of
<EOS>
,
he
first
examined
the
nightgown
,
and
then
devoted
himself
to
the
reading
of
Rosanna
Spearman
's
letter
.
  
<EOS>
The
reading
completed
,
Mr.
Bruff
addressed
me
for
the
first
time
since
we
had
been
shut
up
together
in
the
seclusion
of
his
own
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
Franklin
Blake
,
"
said
the
old
gentleman
,
"
this
is
a
very
serious
matter
,
in
more
respects
than
one
.
<EOS>
In
my
opinion
,
it
concerns
Rachel
quite
as
nearly
as
it
concerns
you
.
<EOS>
Her
extraordinary
conduct
is
no
mystery
NOW
.
<EOS>
She
believes
you
have
stolen
the
Diamond
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
had
shrunk
from
reasoning
my
own
way
fairly
to
that
revolting
conclusion
.
<EOS>
But
it
had
forced
itself
on
me
,
nevertheless
.
<EOS>
My
resolution
to
obtain
a
personal
interview
with
Rachel
,
rested
really
and
truly
on
the
ground
just
stated
by
Mr.
Bruff
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
first
step
to
take
in
this
investigation
,
"
the
lawyer
proceeded
,
"
is
to
appeal
to
Rachel
.
<EOS>
She
has
been
silent
all
this
time
,
from
motives
which
I
(
who
know
her
character
)
can
readily
understand
.
<EOS>
It
is
impossible
,
after
what
has
happened
,
to
submit
to
that
silence
any
longer
.
<EOS>
She
must
be
persuaded
to
tell
us
,
or
she
must
be
forced
to
tell
us
,
on
what
grounds
she
bases
her
belief
that
you
took
the
Moonstone
.
<EOS>
The
chances
are
,
that
the
whole
of
this
case
,
serious
as
it
seems
now
,
will
tumble
to
pieces
,
if
we
can
only
break
through
Rachel
's
inveterate
reserve
,
and
prevail
upon
her
to
speak
out
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
a
very
comforting
opinion
for
_
me
_
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
own
I
should
like
to
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
would
like
to
know
how
I
can
justify
it
,
"
inter
-
posed
Mr.
Bruff
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
tell
you
in
two
minutes
.
<EOS>
Understand
,
in
the
first
place
,
that
I
look
at
this
matter
from
a
lawyer
's
point
of
view
.
<EOS>
It
's
a
question
of
evidence
,
with
me
.
<EOS>
Very
well
.
<EOS>
The
evidence
breaks
down
,
at
the
outset
,
on
one
important
point
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
On
what
point
?
"
  
"
You
shall
hear
.
<EOS>
I
admit
that
the
mark
of
the
name
proves
the
nightgown
to
be
yours
.
<EOS>
I
admit
that
the
mark
of
the
paint
proves
the
nightgown
to
have
made
the
smear
on
Rachel
's
door
.
<EOS>
But
what
evidence
is
there
to
prove
that
you
are
the
person
who
wore
it
,
on
the
night
when
the
Diamond
was
lost
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
objection
struck
me
,
all
the
more
forcibly
that
it
reflected
an
objection
which
I
had
felt
myself
.
  
<EOS>
"
As
to
this
,
"
pursued
the
lawyer
taking
up
Rosanna
Spearman
's
confession
,
"
I
can
understand
that
the
letter
is
a
distressing
one
to
YOU
.
<EOS>
I
can
understand
that
you
may
hesitate
to
analyse
it
from
a
purely
impartial
point
of
view
.
<EOS>
But
I
am
not
in
your
position
.
<EOS>
I
can
bring
my
professional
experience
to
bear
on
this
document
,
just
as
I
should
bring
it
to
bear
on
any
other
.
<EOS>
Without
alluding
to
the
woman
's
career
as
a
thief
,
I
will
merely
remark
that
her
letter
proves
her
to
have
been
an
adept
at
deception
,
on
her
own
showing
;
and
I
argue
from
that
,
that
I
am
justified
in
suspecting
her
of
not
having
told
the
whole
truth
.
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
start
any
theory
,
at
present
,
as
to
what
she
may
or
may
not
have
done
.
<EOS>
I
will
only
say
that
,
if
Rachel
has
suspected
you
ON
THE
EVIDENCE
OF
THE
NIGHTGOWN
ONLY
,
the
chances
are
ninety
-
nine
to
a
hundred
that
Rosanna
Spearman
was
the
person
who
showed
it
to
her
.
<EOS>
In
that
case
,
there
is
the
woman
's
letter
,
confessing
that
she
was
jealous
of
Rachel
,
confessing
that
she
changed
the
roses
,
confessing
that
she
saw
a
glimpse
of
hope
for
herself
,
in
the
prospect
of
a
quarrel
between
Rachel
and
you
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
stop
to
ask
who
took
the
Moonstone
(
as
a
means
to
her
end
,
Rosanna
Spearman
would
have
taken
fifty
Moonstones
)
 
<EOS>
I
only
say
that
the
disappearance
of
the
jewel
gave
this
reclaimed
thief
who
was
in
love
with
you
,
an
opportunity
of
setting
you
and
Rachel
at
variance
for
the
rest
of
your
lives
.
<EOS>
She
had
not
decided
on
destroying
herself
,
THEN
,
remember
;
and
,
having
the
opportunity
,
I
distinctly
assert
that
it
was
in
her
character
,
and
in
her
position
at
the
time
,
to
take
it
.
<EOS>
What
do
you
say
to
that
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Some
such
suspicion
<EOS>
,
"
I
answered
,
"
crossed
my
own
mind
,
as
soon
as
I
opened
the
letter
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Exactly
!
<EOS>
And
when
you
had
read
the
letter
,
you
pitied
the
poor
creature
,
and
could
n't
find
it
in
your
heart
to
suspect
her
.
<EOS>
Does
you
credit
,
my
dear
sir
 
<EOS>
does
you
credit
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
suppose
it
turns
out
that
I
did
wear
the
nightgown
?
<EOS>
What
then
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
see
how
the
fact
can
be
proved
,
"
said
Mr.
Bruff
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
assuming
the
proof
to
be
possible
,
the
vindication
of
your
innocence
would
be
no
easy
matter
.
<EOS>
We
wo
n't
go
into
that
,
now
.
<EOS>
Let
us
wait
and
see
whether
Rachel
has
n't
suspected
you
on
the
evidence
of
the
nightgown
only
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Good
God
,
how
coolly
you
talk
of
Rachel
suspecting
me
!
<EOS>
"
I
broke
out
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
right
has
she
to
suspect
Me
,
on
any
evidence
,
of
being
a
thief
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
very
sensible
question
,
my
dear
sir
.
<EOS>
Rather
hotly
put
 
<EOS>
but
well
worth
considering
for
all
that
.
<EOS>
What
puzzles
you
,
puzzles
me
too
.
<EOS>
Search
your
memory
,
and
tell
me
this
.
<EOS>
Did
anything
happen
while
you
were
staying
at
the
house
 
not
,
of
course
,
to
shake
Rachel
's
belief
in
your
honour
 
<EOS>
but
,
let
us
say
,
to
shake
her
belief
(
no
matter
with
how
little
reason
)
in
your
principles
generally
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
started
,
in
ungovernable
agitation
,
to
my
feet
.
<EOS>
The
lawyer
's
question
reminded
me
,
for
the
first
time
since
I
had
left
England
,
that
something
HAD
happened
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
eighth
chapter
of
Betteredge
's
Narrative
,
an
allusion
will
be
found
to
the
arrival
of
a
foreigner
and
a
stranger
at
my
aunt
's
house
,
who
came
to
see
me
on
business
.
<EOS>
The
nature
of
his
business
was
this
.
  
<EOS>
I
had
been
foolish
enough
(
being
,
as
usual
,
straitened
for
money
at
the
time
)
to
accept
a
loan
from
the
keeper
of
a
small
restaurant
in
Paris
,
to
whom
I
was
well
known
as
a
customer
.
<EOS>
A
time
was
settled
between
us
for
paying
the
money
back
;
and
when
the
time
came
,
I
found
it
(
as
thousands
of
other
honest
men
have
found
it
)
impossible
to
keep
my
engagement
.
<EOS>
I
sent
the
man
a
bill
.
<EOS>
My
name
was
unfortunately
too
well
known
on
such
documents
:
he
failed
to
negotiate
it
.
<EOS>
His
affairs
had
fallen
into
disorder
,
in
the
interval
since
I
had
borrowed
of
him
;
bankruptcy
stared
him
in
the
face
;
and
a
relative
of
his
,
a
French
lawyer
,
came
to
England
to
find
me
,
and
to
insist
upon
the
payment
of
my
debt
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
man
of
violent
temper
;
and
he
took
the
wrong
way
with
me
.
<EOS>
High
words
passed
on
both
sides
;
and
my
aunt
and
Rachel
were
unfortunately
in
the
next
room
,
and
heard
us
.
<EOS>
Lady
Verinder
came
in
,
and
insisted
on
knowing
what
was
the
matter
.
<EOS>
The
Frenchman
produced
his
credentials
,
and
declared
me
to
be
responsible
for
the
ruin
of
a
poor
man
,
who
had
trusted
in
my
honour
.
<EOS>
My
aunt
instantly
paid
him
the
money
,
and
sent
him
off
.
<EOS>
She
knew
me
better
of
course
than
to
take
the
Frenchman
's
view
of
the
transaction
.
<EOS>
But
she
was
shocked
at
my
carelessness
,
and
justly
angry
with
me
for
placing
myself
in
a
position
,
which
,
but
for
her
interference
,
might
have
become
a
very
disgraceful
one
.
<EOS>
Either
her
mother
told
her
,
or
Rachel
heard
what
passed
 
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
say
which
.
<EOS>
She
took
her
own
romantic
,
high
-
flown
view
of
the
matter
.
<EOS>
I
was
"
heartless
"
;
I
was
"
dishonourable
"
;
I
had
"
no
principle
"
;
there
was
"
no
knowing
what
I
might
do
next
<EOS>
"
 
in
short
,
she
said
some
of
the
severest
things
to
me
which
I
had
ever
heard
from
a
young
lady
's
lips
.
<EOS>
The
breach
between
us
lasted
for
the
whole
of
the
next
day
.
<EOS>
The
day
after
,
I
succeeded
in
making
my
peace
,
and
thought
no
more
of
it
.
<EOS>
Had
Rachel
reverted
to
this
unlucky
accident
,
at
the
critical
moment
when
my
place
in
her
estimation
was
again
,
and
far
more
seriously
,
assailed
?
<EOS>
Mr.
Bruff
,
when
I
had
mentioned
the
circumstances
to
him
,
answered
the
question
at
once
in
the
affirmative
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
would
have
its
effect
on
her
mind
,
"
he
said
gravely
.
"
<EOS>
And
I
wish
,
for
your
sake
,
the
thing
had
not
happened
.
<EOS>
However
,
we
have
discovered
that
there
WAS
a
predisposing
influence
against
you
 
<EOS>
and
there
is
one
uncertainty
cleared
out
of
our
way
,
at
any
rate
.
<EOS>
I
see
nothing
more
that
we
can
do
now
.
<EOS>
Our
next
step
in
this
inquiry
must
be
the
step
that
takes
us
to
Rachel
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
rose
,
and
began
walking
thoughtfully
up
and
down
the
room
.
<EOS>
Twice
,
I
was
on
the
point
of
telling
him
that
I
had
determined
on
seeing
Rachel
personally
;
and
twice
,
having
regard
to
his
age
and
his
character
,
I
hesitated
to
take
him
by
surprise
at
an
unfavourable
moment
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
grand
difficulty
is
,
"
he
resumed
,
"
how
to
make
her
show
her
whole
mind
in
this
matter
,
without
reserve
.
<EOS>
Have
you
any
suggestions
to
offer
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
made
up
my
mind
,
Mr.
Bruff
,
to
speak
to
Rachel
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
You
!
"
<EOS>
He
suddenly
stopped
in
his
walk
,
and
looked
at
me
as
if
he
thought
I
had
taken
leave
of
my
senses
.
<EOS>
"
You
,
of
all
the
people
in
the
world
!
"
<EOS>
He
abruptly
checked
himself
,
and
took
another
turn
in
the
room
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Wait
a
little
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
In
cases
of
this
extraordinary
kind
,
the
rash
way
is
sometimes
the
best
way
.
"
<EOS>
He
considered
the
question
for
a
moment
or
two
,
under
that
new
light
,
and
ended
boldly
by
a
decision
in
my
favour
.
"
<EOS>
Nothing
venture
,
nothing
have
,
"
the
old
gentleman
resumed
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
a
chance
in
your
favour
which
I
do
n't
possess
 
<EOS>
and
you
shall
be
the
first
to
try
the
experiment
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
chance
in
my
favour
?
<EOS>
"
I
repeated
,
in
the
greatest
surprise
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Bruff
's
face
softened
,
for
the
first
time
,
into
a
smile
.
  
<EOS>
"
This
is
how
it
stands
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
fairly
,
I
do
n't
trust
your
discretion
,
and
I
do
n't
trust
your
temper
.
<EOS>
But
I
do
trust
in
Rachel
's
still
preserving
,
in
some
remote
little
corner
of
her
heart
,
a
certain
perverse
weakness
for
YOU
.
<EOS>
Touch
that
 
and
trust
to
the
consequences
for
the
fullest
disclosures
that
can
flow
from
a
woman
's
lips
!
<EOS>
The
question
is
 
how
are
you
to
see
her
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
has
been
a
guest
of
yours
at
this
house
,
"
I
answered
.
<EOS>
"
May
I
venture
to
suggest
 
if
nothing
was
said
about
me
<EOS>
beforehand
 
<EOS>
that
I
might
see
her
here
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Cool
!
"
said
Mr.
Bruff
.
<EOS>
With
that
one
word
of
comment
on
the
reply
that
I
had
made
to
him
,
he
took
another
turn
up
and
down
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
In
plain
English
,
"
he
said
,
"
my
house
is
to
be
turned
into
a
trap
to
catch
Rachel
;
with
a
bait
to
tempt
her
,
in
the
shape
of
an
invitation
from
my
wife
and
daughters
.
<EOS>
If
you
were
anybody
else
but
Franklin
Blake
,
and
if
this
matter
was
one
atom
less
serious
than
it
really
is
,
I
should
refuse
point
-
blank
.
<EOS>
As
things
are
,
I
firmly
believe
Rachel
will
live
to
thank
me
for
turning
traitor
to
her
in
my
old
age
.
<EOS>
Consider
me
your
accomplice
.
<EOS>
Rachel
shall
be
asked
to
spend
the
day
here
;
and
you
shall
receive
due
notice
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
When
?
<EOS>
To
-
morrow
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
To
-
morrow
wo
n't
give
us
time
enough
to
get
her
answer
.
<EOS>
Say
the
day
after
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
shall
I
hear
from
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Stay
at
home
all
the
morning
and
expect
me
to
call
on
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
thanked
him
for
the
inestimable
assistance
which
he
was
rendering
to
me
,
with
the
gratitude
that
I
really
felt
;
and
,
declining
a
hospitable
invitation
to
sleep
that
night
at
Hampstead
,
returned
to
my
lodgings
in
London
.
  
<EOS>
Of
the
day
that
followed
,
I
have
only
to
say
that
it
was
the
longest
day
of
my
life
.
<EOS>
Innocent
as
I
knew
myself
to
be
,
certain
as
I
was
that
the
abominable
imputation
which
rested
on
me
must
sooner
or
later
be
cleared
off
,
there
was
nevertheless
a
sense
of
self
-
abasement
in
my
mind
which
instinctively
disinclined
me
to
see
any
of
my
friends
.
<EOS>
We
often
hear
(
almost
invariably
,
however
,
from
superficial
observers
)
that
guilt
can
look
like
innocence
.
<EOS>
I
believe
it
to
be
infinitely
the
truer
axiom
of
the
two
that
innocence
can
look
like
guilt
.
<EOS>
I
caused
myself
to
be
denied
all
day
,
to
every
visitor
who
called
;
and
I
only
ventured
out
under
cover
of
the
night
.
  
<EOS>
The
next
morning
,
Mr.
Bruff
surprised
me
at
the
breakfast
-
table
.
<EOS>
He
handed
me
a
large
key
,
and
announced
that
he
felt
ashamed
of
himself
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
she
coming
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
is
coming
to
-
day
,
to
lunch
and
spend
the
afternoon
with
my
wife
and
my
girls
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Are
Mrs.
Bruff
,
and
your
daughters
,
in
the
secret
?
"
  
"
Inevitably
.
<EOS>
But
women
,
as
you
may
have
observed
,
have
no
principles
.
<EOS>
My
family
do
n't
feel
my
pangs
of
conscience
.
<EOS>
The
end
being
to
bring
you
and
Rachel
together
again
,
my
wife
and
daughters
pass
over
the
means
employed
to
gain
it
,
as
composedly
as
if
they
were
Jesuits
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
infinitely
obliged
to
them
.
<EOS>
What
is
this
key
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
key
of
the
gate
in
my
back
-
garden
wall
.
<EOS>
Be
there
at
three
this
afternoon
.
<EOS>
Let
yourself
into
the
garden
,
and
make
your
way
in
by
the
conservatory
door
.
<EOS>
Cross
the
small
drawing
-
room
,
and
open
the
door
in
front
of
you
which
leads
into
the
music
-
room
.
<EOS>
There
,
you
will
find
Rachel
 
and
find
her
,
alone
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
can
I
thank
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
tell
you
how
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
blame
me
for
what
happens
afterwards
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
With
those
words
,
he
went
out
.
  
<EOS>
I
had
many
weary
hours
still
to
wait
through
.
<EOS>
To
while
away
the
time
,
I
looked
at
my
letters
.
<EOS>
Among
them
was
a
letter
from
Betteredge
.
  
<EOS>
I
opened
it
eagerly
.
<EOS>
To
my
surprise
and
disappointment
,
it
began
with
an
apology
warning
me
to
expect
no
news
of
any
importance
.
<EOS>
In
the
next
sentence
the
everlasting
Ezra
Jennings
appeared
again
!
<EOS>
He
had
stopped
Betteredge
on
the
way
out
of
the
station
,
and
had
asked
who
I
was
.
<EOS>
Informed
on
this
point
,
he
had
mentioned
having
seen
me
to
his
master
Mr.
Candy
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Candy
hearing
of
this
,
had
himself
driven
over
to
Betteredge
,
to
express
his
regret
at
our
having
missed
each
other
.
<EOS>
He
had
a
reason
for
wishing
particularly
to
speak
to
me
;
and
when
I
was
next
in
the
neighbourhood
of
Frizinghall
,
he
begged
I
would
let
him
know
.
<EOS>
Apart
from
a
few
characteristic
utterances
of
the
Betteredge
philosophy
,
this
was
the
sum
and
substance
of
my
correspondent
's
letter
.
<EOS>
The
warm
-
hearted
,
faithful
old
man
acknowledged
that
he
had
written
"
mainly
for
the
pleasure
of
writing
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
crumpled
up
the
letter
in
my
pocket
,
and
forgot
it
the
moment
after
,
in
the
all
-
absorbing
interest
of
my
coming
interview
with
Rachel
.
  
<EOS>
As
the
clock
of
Hampstead
church
struck
three
,
I
put
Mr.
Bruff
's
key
into
the
lock
of
the
door
in
the
wall
.
<EOS>
When
I
first
stepped
into
the
garden
,
and
while
I
was
securing
the
door
again
on
the
inner
side
,
I
own
to
having
felt
a
certain
guilty
doubtfulness
about
what
might
happen
next
.
<EOS>
I
looked
furtively
on
either
side
of
me
;
suspicious
of
the
presence
of
some
unexpected
witness
in
some
unknown
corner
of
the
garden
.
<EOS>
Nothing
appeared
,
to
justify
my
apprehensions
.
<EOS>
The
walks
were
,
one
and
all
,
solitudes
;
and
the
birds
and
the
bees
were
the
only
witnesses
.
  
<EOS>
I
passed
through
the
garden
;
entered
the
conservatory
;
and
crossed
the
small
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
As
I
laid
my
hand
on
the
door
opposite
,
I
heard
a
few
plaintive
chords
struck
on
the
piano
in
the
room
within
.
<EOS>
She
had
often
idled
over
the
instrument
in
this
way
,
when
I
was
staying
at
her
mother
's
house
.
<EOS>
I
was
obliged
to
wait
a
little
,
to
steady
myself
.
<EOS>
The
past
and
present
rose
side
by
side
,
at
that
supreme
moment
 
and
the
contrast
shook
me
.
  
<EOS>
After
the
lapse
of
a
minute
,
I
roused
my
manhood
,
and
opened
the
door
.
    
<EOS>
At
the
moment
when
I
showed
myself
in
the
doorway
,
Rachel
rose
from
the
piano
.
  
<EOS>
I
closed
the
door
behind
me
.
<EOS>
We
confronted
each
other
in
silence
,
with
the
full
length
of
the
room
between
us
.
<EOS>
The
movement
she
had
made
in
rising
appeared
to
be
the
one
exertion
of
which
she
was
capable
.
<EOS>
All
use
of
every
other
faculty
,
bodily
or
mental
,
seemed
to
be
merged
in
the
mere
act
of
looking
at
me
.
  
<EOS>
A
fear
crossed
my
mind
that
I
had
shown
myself
too
suddenly
.
<EOS>
I
advanced
a
few
steps
towards
her
.
<EOS>
I
said
gently
,
"
Rachel
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
sound
of
my
voice
brought
the
life
back
to
her
limbs
,
and
the
colour
to
her
face
.
<EOS>
She
advanced
,
on
her
side
,
still
without
speaking
.
<EOS>
Slowly
,
as
if
acting
under
some
influence
independent
of
her
own
will
,
she
came
nearer
and
nearer
to
me
;
the
warm
dusky
colour
flushing
her
cheeks
,
the
light
of
reviving
intelligence
brightening
every
instant
in
her
eyes
.
<EOS>
I
forgot
the
object
that
had
brought
me
into
her
presence
;
I
forgot
the
vile
suspicion
that
rested
on
my
good
name
;
I
forgot
every
consideration
,
past
,
present
,
and
future
,
which
I
was
bound
to
remember
.
<EOS>
I
saw
nothing
but
the
woman
I
loved
coming
nearer
and
nearer
to
me
.
<EOS>
She
trembled
;
she
stood
irresolute
.
<EOS>
I
could
resist
it
no
longer
 
<EOS>
I
caught
her
in
my
arms
,
and
covered
her
face
with
kisses
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
moment
when
I
thought
the
kisses
were
returned
;
a
moment
when
it
seemed
as
if
she
,
too
might
have
forgotten
.
<EOS>
Almost
before
the
idea
could
shape
itself
in
my
mind
,
her
first
voluntary
action
made
me
feel
that
she
remembered
.
<EOS>
With
a
cry
which
was
like
a
cry
of
horror
 
with
a
strength
which
I
doubt
if
I
could
have
resisted
if
I
had
tried
 
<EOS>
she
thrust
me
back
from
her
.
<EOS>
I
saw
merciless
anger
in
her
eyes
;
I
saw
merciless
contempt
on
her
lips
.
<EOS>
She
looked
me
over
,
from
head
to
foot
,
as
she
might
have
looked
at
a
stranger
who
had
insulted
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
coward
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
You
mean
,
miserable
,
heartless
coward
!
"
  
<EOS>
Those
were
her
first
words
!
<EOS>
The
most
unendurable
reproach
that
a
woman
can
address
to
a
man
,
was
the
reproach
that
she
picked
out
to
address
to
Me
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
remember
the
time
,
Rachel
,
"
I
said
,
"
when
you
could
have
told
me
that
I
had
offended
you
,
in
a
worthier
way
than
that
.
<EOS>
I
beg
your
pardon
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Something
of
the
bitterness
that
I
felt
may
have
communicated
itself
to
my
voice
.
<EOS>
At
the
first
words
of
my
reply
,
her
eyes
,
which
had
been
turned
away
the
moment
before
,
looked
back
at
me
unwillingly
.
<EOS>
She
answered
in
a
low
tone
,
with
a
sullen
submission
of
manner
which
was
quite
new
in
my
experience
of
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
there
is
some
excuse
for
me
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
After
what
you
have
done
,
is
it
a
manly
action
,
on
your
part
,
to
find
your
way
to
me
as
you
have
found
it
to
-
day
?
<EOS>
It
seems
a
cowardly
experiment
,
to
try
an
experiment
on
my
weakness
for
you
.
<EOS>
It
seems
a
cowardly
surprise
,
to
surprise
me
into
letting
you
kiss
me
.
<EOS>
But
that
is
only
a
woman
's
view
.
<EOS>
I
ought
to
have
known
it
could
n't
be
your
view
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
done
better
if
I
had
controlled
myself
,
and
said
nothing
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
apology
was
more
unendurable
than
the
insult
.
<EOS>
The
most
degraded
man
living
would
have
felt
humiliated
by
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
my
honour
was
not
in
your
hands
,
"
I
said
,
"
I
would
leave
you
this
instant
,
and
never
see
you
again
.
<EOS>
You
have
spoken
of
what
I
have
done
.
<EOS>
What
have
I
done
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
have
you
done
!
<EOS>
YOU
ask
that
question
of
ME
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
ask
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
kept
your
infamy
a
secret
,
"
she
answered
.
<EOS>
"
And
I
have
suffered
the
consequences
of
concealing
it
.
<EOS>
Have
I
no
claim
to
be
spared
the
insult
of
your
asking
me
what
you
have
done
?
<EOS>
Is
ALL
sense
of
gratitude
dead
in
you
?
<EOS>
You
were
once
a
gentleman
.
<EOS>
You
were
once
dear
to
my
mother
,
and
dearer
still
to
me
 
"
  
Her
voice
failed
her
.
<EOS>
She
dropped
into
a
chair
,
and
turned
her
back
on
me
,
and
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
.
  
<EOS>
I
waited
a
little
before
I
trusted
myself
to
say
any
more
.
<EOS>
In
that
moment
of
silence
,
I
hardly
know
which
I
felt
most
keenly
 
<EOS>
the
sting
which
her
contempt
had
planted
in
me
,
or
the
proud
resolution
which
shut
me
out
from
all
community
with
her
distress
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
will
not
speak
first
,
"
I
said
,
"
I
must
.
<EOS>
I
have
come
here
with
something
serious
to
say
to
you
.
<EOS>
Will
you
do
me
the
common
justice
of
listening
while
I
say
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
neither
moved
,
nor
answered
.
<EOS>
I
made
no
second
appeal
to
her
;
I
never
advanced
an
inch
nearer
to
her
chair
.
<EOS>
With
a
pride
which
was
as
obstinate
as
her
pride
,
I
told
her
of
my
discovery
at
the
Shivering
Sand
,
and
of
all
that
had
led
to
it
.
<EOS>
The
narrative
,
of
necessity
,
occupied
some
little
time
.
<EOS>
From
beginning
to
end
,
she
never
looked
round
at
me
,
and
she
never
uttered
a
word
.
  
<EOS>
I
kept
my
temper
.
<EOS>
My
whole
future
depended
,
in
all
probability
,
on
my
not
losing
possession
of
myself
at
that
moment
.
<EOS>
The
time
had
come
to
put
Mr.
Bruff
's
theory
to
the
test
.
<EOS>
In
the
breathless
interest
of
trying
that
experiment
,
I
moved
round
so
as
to
place
myself
in
front
of
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
a
question
to
ask
you
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
It
obliges
me
to
refer
again
to
a
painful
subject
.
<EOS>
Did
Rosanna
Spearman
show
you
the
nightgown
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
or
No
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
started
to
her
feet
;
and
walked
close
up
to
me
of
her
own
accord
.
<EOS>
Her
eyes
looked
me
searchingly
in
the
face
,
as
if
to
read
something
there
which
they
had
never
read
yet
.
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
mad
?
"
<EOS>
she
asked
.
  
<EOS>
I
still
restrained
myself
.
<EOS>
I
said
quietly
,
"
Rachel
,
will
you
answer
my
question
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
went
on
,
without
heeding
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
Have
you
some
object
to
gain
which
I
do
n't
understand
?
<EOS>
Some
mean
fear
about
the
future
,
in
which
I
am
concerned
?
<EOS>
They
say
your
father
's
death
has
made
you
a
rich
man
.
<EOS>
Have
you
come
here
to
compensate
me
for
the
loss
of
my
Diamond
?
<EOS>
And
have
you
heart
enough
left
to
feel
ashamed
of
your
errand
?
<EOS>
Is
THAT
the
secret
of
your
pretence
of
innocence
,
and
your
story
about
Rosanna
Spearman
?
<EOS>
Is
there
a
motive
of
shame
at
the
bottom
of
all
the
falsehood
,
this
time
?
"
  
<EOS>
I
stopped
her
there
.
<EOS>
I
could
control
myself
no
longer
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
done
me
an
infamous
wrong
!
<EOS>
"
I
broke
out
hotly
.
<EOS>
"
You
suspect
me
of
stealing
your
Diamond
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
right
to
know
,
and
I
WILL
know
,
the
reason
why
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Suspect
you
!
"
<EOS>
she
exclaimed
,
her
anger
rising
with
mine
.
"
<EOS>
YOU
VILLAIN
<EOS>
,
I
SAW
YOU
TAKE
THE
DIAMOND
WITH
MY
OWN
EYES
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
revelation
which
burst
upon
me
in
those
words
,
the
overthrow
which
they
instantly
accomplished
of
the
whole
view
of
the
case
on
which
Mr.
Bruff
had
relied
,
struck
me
helpless
.
<EOS>
Innocent
as
I
was
,
I
stood
before
her
in
silence
.
<EOS>
To
her
eyes
,
to
any
eyes
,
I
must
have
looked
like
a
man
overwhelmed
by
the
discovery
of
his
own
guilt
.
  
<EOS>
She
drew
back
from
the
spectacle
of
my
humiliation
and
of
her
triumph
.
<EOS>
The
sudden
silence
that
had
fallen
upon
me
seemed
to
frighten
her
.
<EOS>
"
I
spared
you
,
at
the
time
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
have
spared
you
now
,
if
you
had
not
forced
me
to
speak
.
"
<EOS>
She
moved
away
as
if
to
leave
the
room
 
and
hesitated
before
she
got
to
the
door
.
<EOS>
"
Why
did
you
come
here
to
humiliate
yourself
?
"
<EOS>
she
asked
.
<EOS>
"
Why
did
you
come
here
to
humiliate
me
?
"
<EOS>
She
went
on
a
few
steps
,
and
paused
once
more
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
For
God
's
sake
,
say
something
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
exclaimed
,
passionately
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
have
any
mercy
left
,
do
n't
let
me
degrade
myself
in
this
way
!
<EOS>
Say
something
 
and
drive
me
out
of
the
room
!
"
  
<EOS>
I
advanced
towards
her
,
hardly
conscious
of
what
I
was
doing
.
<EOS>
I
had
possibly
some
confused
idea
of
detaining
her
until
she
had
told
me
more
.
<EOS>
From
the
moment
when
I
knew
that
the
evidence
on
which
I
stood
condemned
in
Rachel
's
mind
,
was
the
evidence
of
her
own
eyes
,
nothing
 
not
even
my
conviction
of
my
own
innocence
 
was
clear
to
my
mind
.
<EOS>
I
took
her
by
the
hand
;
I
tried
to
speak
firmly
and
to
the
purpose
.
<EOS>
All
I
could
say
was
,
"
Rachel
,
you
once
loved
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
shuddered
,
and
looked
away
from
me
.
<EOS>
Her
hand
lay
powerless
and
trembling
in
mine
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Let
go
of
it
,
"
she
said
faintly
.
  
<EOS>
My
touch
seemed
to
have
the
same
effect
on
her
which
the
sound
of
my
voice
had
produced
when
I
first
entered
the
room
.
<EOS>
After
she
had
said
the
word
which
called
me
a
coward
,
after
she
had
made
the
avowal
which
branded
me
as
a
thief
 
while
her
hand
lay
in
mine
<EOS>
I
was
her
master
still
!
  
<EOS>
I
drew
her
gently
back
into
the
middle
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
I
seated
her
by
the
side
of
me
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Rachel
,
"
I
said
,
"
I
ca
n't
explain
the
contradiction
in
what
I
am
going
to
tell
you
.
<EOS>
I
can
only
speak
the
truth
as
you
have
spoken
it
.
<EOS>
You
saw
me
 
with
your
own
eyes
,
you
saw
me
take
the
Diamond
.
<EOS>
Before
God
who
hears
us
,
I
declare
that
I
now
know
I
took
it
for
the
first
time
!
<EOS>
Do
you
doubt
me
still
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
had
neither
heeded
nor
heard
me
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Let
go
of
my
hand
,
"
she
repeated
faintly
.
<EOS>
That
was
her
only
answer
.
<EOS>
Her
head
sank
on
my
shoulder
;
and
her
hand
unconsciously
closed
on
mine
,
at
the
moment
when
she
asked
me
to
release
it
.
  
<EOS>
I
refrained
from
pressing
the
question
.
<EOS>
But
there
my
forbearance
stopped
.
<EOS>
My
chance
of
ever
holding
up
my
head
again
among
honest
men
depended
on
my
chance
of
inducing
her
to
make
her
disclosure
complete
.
<EOS>
The
one
hope
left
for
me
was
the
hope
that
she
might
have
overlooked
something
in
the
chain
of
evidence
 
some
mere
trifle
,
perhaps
,
which
might
nevertheless
,
under
careful
investigation
,
be
made
the
means
of
vindicating
my
innocence
in
the
end
.
<EOS>
I
own
I
kept
possession
of
her
hand
.
<EOS>
I
own
I
spoke
to
her
with
all
that
I
could
summon
back
of
the
sympathy
and
confidence
of
the
bygone
time
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
ask
you
something
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
want
you
to
tell
me
everything
that
happened
,
from
the
time
when
we
wished
each
other
good
night
,
to
the
time
when
you
saw
me
take
the
Diamond
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
lifted
her
head
from
my
shoulder
,
and
made
an
effort
to
release
her
hand
.
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
why
go
back
to
it
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
Why
go
back
to
it
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
tell
you
why
,
Rachel
.
<EOS>
You
are
the
victim
,
and
I
am
the
victim
,
of
some
monstrous
delusion
which
has
worn
the
mask
of
truth
.
<EOS>
If
we
look
at
what
happened
on
the
night
of
your
birthday
together
,
we
may
end
in
understanding
each
other
yet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Her
head
dropped
back
on
my
shoulder
.
<EOS>
The
tears
gathered
in
her
eyes
,
and
fell
slowly
over
her
cheeks
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
"
she
said
,
"
have
I
never
had
that
hope
?
<EOS>
Have
I
not
tried
to
see
it
,
as
you
are
trying
now
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
tried
by
yourself
,
"
I
answered
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
not
tried
with
me
to
help
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Those
words
seemed
to
awaken
in
her
something
of
the
hope
which
I
felt
myself
when
I
uttered
them
.
<EOS>
She
replied
to
my
questions
with
more
than
docility
 
she
exerted
her
intelligence
;
she
willingly
opened
her
whole
mind
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
Let
us
begin
,
"
I
said
,
"
with
what
happened
after
we
had
wished
each
other
good
night
.
<EOS>
Did
you
go
to
bed
?
<EOS>
or
did
you
sit
up
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
went
to
bed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
you
notice
the
time
?
<EOS>
Was
it
late
?
"
  
"
Not
very
.
<EOS>
About
twelve
o'clock
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Did
you
fall
asleep
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
No
.
<EOS>
I
could
n't
sleep
that
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
were
restless
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
thinking
of
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
answer
almost
unmanned
me
.
<EOS>
Something
in
the
tone
,
even
more
than
in
the
words
,
went
straight
to
my
heart
.
<EOS>
It
was
only
after
pausing
a
little
first
that
I
was
able
to
go
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
Had
you
any
light
in
your
room
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
None
 
until
I
got
up
again
,
and
lit
my
candle
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
long
was
that
,
after
you
had
gone
to
bed
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
About
an
hour
after
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
About
one
o'clock
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
you
leave
your
bedroom
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
going
to
leave
it
.
<EOS>
I
had
put
on
my
dressing
-
gown
;
and
I
was
going
into
my
sitting
-
room
to
get
a
book
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
Had
you
opened
your
bedroom
door
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
had
just
opened
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
had
not
gone
into
the
sitting
-
room
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
No
 
I
was
stopped
from
going
into
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
stopped
you
?
  
<EOS>
"
I
saw
a
light
,
under
the
door
;
and
I
heard
footsteps
approaching
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Were
you
frightened
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Not
then
.
<EOS>
I
knew
my
poor
mother
was
a
bad
sleeper
;
and
I
remembered
that
she
had
tried
hard
,
that
evening
,
to
persuade
me
to
let
her
take
charge
of
my
Diamond
.
<EOS>
She
was
unreasonably
anxious
about
it
,
as
I
thought
;
and
I
fancied
she
was
coming
to
me
to
see
if
I
was
in
bed
,
and
to
speak
to
me
about
the
Diamond
again
,
if
she
found
that
I
was
up
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
did
you
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
blew
out
my
candle
,
so
that
she
might
think
I
was
in
bed
.
<EOS>
I
was
unreasonable
,
on
my
side
 
<EOS>
I
was
determined
to
keep
my
Diamond
in
the
place
of
my
own
choosing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
After
blowing
out
the
candle
,
did
you
go
back
to
bed
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
had
no
time
to
go
back
.
<EOS>
At
the
moment
when
I
blew
the
candle
out
,
the
sitting
-
room
door
opened
,
and
I
saw
 
"
  
"
You
saw
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
You
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Dressed
as
usual
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
In
my
nightgown
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
In
your
nightgown
 
with
your
bedroom
candle
in
your
hand
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Alone
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Alone
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Could
you
see
my
face
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
Plainly
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Quite
plainly
.
<EOS>
The
candle
in
your
hand
showed
it
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Were
my
eyes
open
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
you
notice
anything
strange
in
them
?
<EOS>
Anything
like
a
fixed
,
vacant
expression
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nothing
of
the
sort
.
<EOS>
Your
eyes
were
bright
 
brighter
than
usual
.
<EOS>
You
looked
about
in
the
room
,
as
if
you
knew
you
were
where
you
ought
not
to
be
,
and
as
if
you
were
afraid
of
being
found
out
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
you
observe
one
thing
when
I
came
into
the
room
 
<EOS>
did
you
observe
how
I
walked
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
walked
as
you
always
do
.
<EOS>
You
came
in
as
far
as
the
middle
of
the
room
 
<EOS>
and
then
you
stopped
and
looked
about
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
did
you
do
,
on
first
seeing
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
could
do
nothing
.
<EOS>
I
was
petrified
.
<EOS>
I
could
n't
speak
,
I
could
n't
call
out
,
I
could
n't
even
move
to
shut
my
door
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Could
I
see
you
,
where
you
stood
?
"
  
"
You
might
certainly
have
seen
me
.
<EOS>
But
you
never
looked
towards
me
.
<EOS>
It
's
useless
to
ask
the
question
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
you
never
saw
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
are
you
sure
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Would
you
have
taken
the
Diamond
?
<EOS>
would
you
have
acted
as
you
did
afterwards
?
<EOS>
would
you
be
here
now
 
if
you
had
seen
that
I
was
awake
and
looking
at
you
?
<EOS>
Do
n't
make
me
talk
of
that
part
of
it
!
<EOS>
I
want
to
answer
you
quietly
.
<EOS>
Help
me
to
keep
as
calm
as
I
can
.
<EOS>
Go
on
to
something
else
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
was
right
 
in
every
way
,
<EOS>
right
.
<EOS>
I
went
on
to
other
things
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
did
I
do
,
after
I
had
got
to
the
middle
of
the
room
,
and
had
stopped
there
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
turned
away
,
and
went
straight
to
the
corner
near
the
window
 
where
my
Indian
cabinet
stands
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
When
I
was
at
the
cabinet
,
my
back
must
have
been
turned
towards
you
.
<EOS>
How
did
you
see
what
I
was
doing
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
When
you
moved
,
I
moved
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
So
as
to
see
what
I
was
about
with
my
hands
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
are
three
glasses
in
my
sitting
-
room
.
<EOS>
As
you
stood
there
,
I
saw
all
that
you
did
,
reflected
in
one
of
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
did
you
see
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
put
your
candle
on
the
top
of
the
cabinet
.
<EOS>
You
opened
,
and
shut
,
one
drawer
after
another
,
until
you
came
to
the
drawer
in
which
I
had
put
my
Diamond
.
<EOS>
You
looked
at
the
open
drawer
for
a
moment
.
<EOS>
And
then
you
put
your
hand
in
,
and
took
the
Diamond
out
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
know
I
took
the
Diamond
out
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
saw
your
hand
go
into
the
drawer
.
<EOS>
And
I
saw
the
gleam
of
the
stone
between
your
finger
and
thumb
,
when
you
took
your
hand
out
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
my
hand
approach
the
drawer
again
 
to
close
it
,
for
instance
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
.
<EOS>
You
had
the
Diamond
in
your
right
hand
;
and
you
took
the
candle
from
the
top
of
the
cabinet
with
your
left
hand
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
I
look
about
me
again
,
after
that
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
I
leave
the
room
immediately
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
No
.
<EOS>
You
stood
quite
still
,
for
what
seemed
a
long
time
.
<EOS>
I
saw
your
face
sideways
in
the
glass
.
<EOS>
You
looked
like
a
man
thinking
,
and
dissatisfied
with
his
own
thoughts
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
happened
next
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
roused
yourself
on
a
sudden
,
and
you
went
straight
out
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
I
close
the
door
after
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
.
<EOS>
You
passed
out
quickly
into
the
passage
,
and
left
the
door
open
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
then
?
"
  
"
Then
,
your
light
disappeared
,
and
the
sound
of
your
steps
died
away
,
and
I
was
left
alone
in
the
dark
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
nothing
happen
 
from
that
time
,
to
the
time
when
the
whole
house
knew
that
the
Diamond
was
lost
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nothing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
sure
of
that
?
<EOS>
Might
you
not
have
been
asleep
a
part
of
the
time
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
slept
.
<EOS>
I
never
went
back
to
my
bed
.
<EOS>
Nothing
happened
until
Penelope
came
in
,
at
the
usual
time
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
"
  
I
dropped
her
hand
,
and
rose
,
and
took
a
turn
in
the
room
.
<EOS>
Every
question
that
I
could
put
had
been
answered
.
<EOS>
Every
detail
that
I
could
desire
to
know
had
been
placed
before
me
.
<EOS>
I
had
even
reverted
to
the
idea
of
sleep
-
walking
,
and
the
idea
of
intoxication
;
and
,
again
,
the
worthlessness
of
the
one
theory
and
the
other
had
been
proved
 
on
the
authority
,
this
time
,
of
the
witness
who
had
seen
me
.
<EOS>
What
was
to
be
said
next
?
<EOS>
what
was
to
be
done
next
?
<EOS>
There
rose
the
horrible
fact
of
the
Theft
 
<EOS>
the
one
visible
,
tangible
object
that
confronted
me
,
in
the
midst
of
the
impenetrable
darkness
which
enveloped
all
besides
!
<EOS>
Not
a
glimpse
of
light
to
guide
me
,
when
I
had
possessed
myself
of
Rosanna
Spearman
's
secret
at
the
Shivering
Sand
.
<EOS>
And
not
a
glimpse
of
light
now
,
when
I
had
appealed
to
Rachel
herself
,
and
had
heard
the
hateful
story
of
the
night
from
her
own
lips
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
the
first
,
this
time
,
to
break
the
silence
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
?
"
she
said
,
"
you
have
asked
,
and
I
have
answered
.
<EOS>
You
have
made
me
hope
something
from
all
this
,
because
you
hoped
something
from
it
.
<EOS>
What
have
you
to
say
now
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
tone
in
which
she
spoke
warned
me
that
my
influence
over
her
was
a
lost
influence
once
more
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
were
to
look
at
what
happened
on
my
birthday
night
,
together
,
"
she
went
on
;
"
and
we
were
then
to
understand
each
other
.
<EOS>
Have
we
done
that
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
waited
pitilessly
for
my
reply
.
<EOS>
In
answering
her
I
committed
a
fatal
error
 
<EOS>
I
let
the
exasperating
helplessness
of
my
situation
get
the
better
of
my
self
-
control
.
<EOS>
Rashly
and
uselessly
,
I
reproached
her
for
the
silence
which
had
kept
me
until
that
moment
in
ignorance
of
the
truth
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
had
spoken
when
you
ought
to
have
spoken
,
"
I
began
;
"
if
you
had
done
me
the
common
justice
to
explain
yourself
 
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
broke
in
on
me
with
a
cry
of
fury
.
<EOS>
The
few
words
I
had
said
seemed
to
have
lashed
her
on
the
instant
into
a
frenzy
of
rage
.
  
<EOS>
"
Explain
myself
!
"
<EOS>
she
repeated
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
is
there
another
man
like
this
in
the
world
?
<EOS>
I
spare
him
,
when
my
heart
is
breaking
;
I
screen
him
when
my
own
character
is
at
stake
;
and
HE
 
of
all
human
beings
,
HE
 
turns
on
me
now
,
and
tells
me
that
I
ought
to
have
explained
myself
!
<EOS>
After
believing
in
him
as
I
did
,
after
loving
him
as
I
did
,
after
thinking
of
him
by
day
,
and
dreaming
of
him
by
night
 
he
wonders
I
did
n't
charge
him
with
his
disgrace
the
first
time
we
met
:
"
My
heart
's
darling
,
you
are
a
Thief
!
<EOS>
My
hero
whom
I
love
and
honour
,
you
have
crept
into
my
room
under
cover
of
the
night
,
and
stolen
my
Diamond
!
"
<EOS>
That
is
what
I
ought
to
have
said
.
<EOS>
You
villain
,
you
mean
,
mean
,
mean
villain
,
I
would
have
lost
fifty
diamonds
,
rather
than
see
your
face
lying
to
me
,
as
I
see
it
lying
now
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
took
up
my
hat
.
<EOS>
In
mercy
to
HER
 
<EOS>
yes
!
<EOS>
I
can
honestly
say
it
 
in
mercy
to
HER
,
I
turned
away
without
a
word
,
and
opened
the
door
by
which
I
had
entered
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
She
followed
,
and
snatched
the
door
out
of
my
hand
;
she
closed
it
,
and
pointed
back
to
the
place
that
I
had
left
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
Not
yet
!
<EOS>
It
seems
that
I
owe
a
justification
of
my
conduct
to
you
.
<EOS>
You
shall
stay
and
hear
it
.
<EOS>
Or
you
shall
stoop
to
the
lowest
infamy
of
all
,
and
force
your
way
out
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
wrung
my
heart
to
see
her
;
it
wrung
my
heart
to
hear
her
.
<EOS>
I
answered
by
a
sign
 
it
was
all
I
could
do
 
that
I
submitted
myself
to
her
will
.
  
<EOS>
The
crimson
flush
of
anger
began
to
fade
out
of
her
face
,
as
I
went
back
,
and
took
my
chair
in
silence
.
<EOS>
She
waited
a
little
,
and
steadied
herself
.
<EOS>
When
she
went
on
,
but
one
sign
of
feeling
was
discernible
in
her
.
<EOS>
She
spoke
without
looking
at
me
.
<EOS>
Her
hands
were
fast
clasped
in
her
lap
,
and
her
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
ground
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
ought
to
have
done
you
the
common
justice
to
explain
myself
,
"
she
said
,
repeating
my
own
words
.
<EOS>
"
You
shall
see
whether
I
did
try
to
do
you
justice
,
or
not
.
<EOS>
I
told
you
just
now
that
I
never
slept
,
and
never
returned
to
my
bed
,
after
you
had
left
my
sitting
-
room
.
<EOS>
It
's
useless
to
trouble
you
by
dwelling
on
what
I
thought
 
<EOS>
you
would
not
understand
my
thoughts
 
<EOS>
I
will
only
tell
you
what
I
did
,
when
time
enough
had
passed
to
help
me
to
recover
myself
.
<EOS>
I
refrained
from
alarming
the
house
,
and
telling
everybody
what
had
happened
 
as
I
ought
to
have
done
.
<EOS>
In
spite
of
what
I
had
seen
,
I
was
fond
enough
of
you
to
believe
 
<EOS>
no
matter
what
!
 
<EOS>
any
impossibility
,
rather
than
admit
it
to
my
own
mind
that
you
were
deliberately
a
thief
.
<EOS>
I
thought
and
thought
 
<EOS>
and
I
ended
in
writing
to
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
received
the
letter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
you
never
received
it
.
<EOS>
Wait
a
little
,
and
you
shall
hear
why
.
<EOS>
My
letter
would
have
told
you
nothing
openly
.
<EOS>
It
would
not
have
ruined
you
for
life
,
if
it
had
fallen
into
some
other
person
's
hands
.
<EOS>
It
would
only
have
said
 
in
a
manner
which
you
yourself
could
not
possibly
have
mistaken
 
that
I
had
reason
to
know
you
were
in
debt
,
and
that
it
was
in
my
experience
and
in
my
mother
's
experience
of
you
,
that
you
were
not
very
discreet
,
or
very
scrupulous
about
how
you
got
money
when
you
wanted
it
.
<EOS>
You
would
have
remembered
the
visit
of
the
French
lawyer
,
and
you
would
have
known
what
I
referred
to
.
<EOS>
If
you
had
read
on
with
some
interest
after
that
,
you
would
have
come
to
an
offer
I
had
to
make
to
you
 
<EOS>
the
offer
,
privately
(
not
a
word
,
mind
,
to
be
said
openly
about
it
between
us
!
)
,
of
the
loan
of
as
large
a
sum
of
money
as
I
could
get
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
would
have
got
it
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
exclaimed
,
her
colour
beginning
to
rise
again
,
and
her
eyes
looking
up
at
me
once
more
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
have
pledged
the
Diamond
myself
,
if
I
could
have
got
the
money
in
no
other
way
!
<EOS>
In
those
words
I
wrote
to
you
.
<EOS>
Wait
!
<EOS>
I
did
more
than
that
.
<EOS>
I
arranged
with
Penelope
to
give
you
the
letter
when
nobody
was
near
.
<EOS>
I
planned
to
shut
myself
into
my
bedroom
,
and
to
have
the
sitting
-
room
left
open
and
empty
all
the
morning
.
<EOS>
And
I
hoped
 
with
all
my
heart
and
soul
I
hoped
!
 
<EOS>
that
you
would
take
the
opportunity
,
and
put
the
Diamond
back
secretly
in
the
drawer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
attempted
to
speak
.
<EOS>
She
lifted
her
hand
impatiently
,
and
stopped
me
.
<EOS>
In
the
rapid
alternations
of
her
temper
,
her
anger
was
beginning
to
rise
again
.
<EOS>
She
got
up
from
her
chair
,
and
approached
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
what
you
are
going
to
say
,
"
she
went
on
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
going
to
remind
me
again
that
you
never
received
my
letter
.
<EOS>
I
can
tell
you
why
.
<EOS>
I
tore
it
up
.
  
<EOS>
"
For
what
reason
?
"
I
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
For
the
best
of
reasons
.
<EOS>
I
preferred
tearing
it
up
to
throwing
it
away
upon
such
a
man
as
you
!
<EOS>
What
was
the
first
news
that
reached
me
in
the
morning
?
<EOS>
Just
as
my
little
plan
was
complete
,
what
did
I
hear
?
<EOS>
I
heard
that
you
 
you
!
!
!
 
<EOS>
were
the
foremost
person
in
the
house
in
fetching
the
police
.
<EOS>
You
were
the
active
man
;
you
were
the
leader
;
you
were
working
harder
than
any
of
them
to
recover
the
jewel
!
<EOS>
You
even
carried
your
audacity
far
enough
to
ask
to
speak
to
ME
about
the
loss
of
the
Diamond
 
the
Diamond
which
you
yourself
had
stolen
;
the
Diamond
which
was
all
the
time
in
your
own
hands
!
<EOS>
After
that
proof
of
your
horrible
falseness
and
cunning
,
I
tore
up
my
letter
.
<EOS>
But
even
then
 
even
when
I
was
maddened
by
the
searching
and
questioning
of
the
policeman
,
whom
you
had
sent
in
 
even
then
,
there
was
some
infatuation
in
my
mind
which
would
n't
let
me
give
you
up
.
<EOS>
I
said
to
myself
,
"
He
has
played
his
vile
farce
before
everybody
else
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
Let
me
try
if
he
can
play
it
before
me
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Somebody
told
me
you
were
on
the
terrace
.
<EOS>
I
went
down
to
the
terrace
.
<EOS>
I
forced
myself
to
look
at
you
;
I
forced
myself
to
speak
to
you
.
<EOS>
Have
you
forgotten
what
I
said
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
might
have
answered
that
I
remembered
every
word
of
it
.
<EOS>
But
what
purpose
,
at
that
moment
,
would
the
answer
have
served
?
  
<EOS>
How
could
I
tell
her
that
what
she
had
said
had
astonished
me
,
had
distressed
me
,
had
suggested
to
me
that
she
was
in
a
state
of
dangerous
nervous
excitement
,
had
even
roused
a
moment
's
doubt
in
my
mind
whether
the
loss
of
the
jewel
was
as
much
a
mystery
to
her
as
to
the
rest
of
us
 
but
had
never
once
given
me
so
much
as
a
glimpse
at
the
truth
?
<EOS>
Without
the
shadow
of
a
proof
to
produce
in
vindication
of
my
innocence
,
how
could
I
persuade
her
that
I
knew
no
more
than
the
veriest
stranger
could
have
known
of
what
was
really
in
her
thoughts
when
she
spoke
to
me
on
the
terrace
?
  
<EOS>
"
It
may
suit
your
convenience
to
forget
;
it
suits
my
convenience
to
remember
,
"
she
went
on
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
what
I
said
 
for
I
considered
it
with
myself
,
before
I
said
it
.
<EOS>
I
gave
you
one
opportunity
after
another
of
owning
the
truth
.
<EOS>
I
left
nothing
unsaid
that
I
COULD
say
 
short
of
actually
telling
you
that
I
knew
you
had
committed
the
theft
.
<EOS>
And
all
the
return
you
made
,
was
to
look
at
me
with
your
vile
pretence
of
astonishment
,
and
your
false
face
of
innocence
 
just
as
you
have
looked
at
me
to
-
day
;
just
as
you
are
looking
at
me
now
!
<EOS>
I
left
you
,
that
morning
,
knowing
you
at
last
for
what
you
were
 
for
what
you
are
 
as
base
a
wretch
as
ever
walked
the
earth
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
had
spoken
out
at
the
time
,
you
might
have
left
me
,
Rachel
,
knowing
that
you
had
cruelly
wronged
an
innocent
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
had
spoken
out
before
other
people
,
"
she
retorted
,
with
another
burst
of
indignation
,
"
you
would
have
been
disgraced
for
life
!
<EOS>
If
I
had
spoken
out
to
no
ears
<EOS>
but
yours
,
you
would
have
denied
it
,
as
you
are
denying
it
now
!
<EOS>
Do
you
think
I
should
have
believed
you
?
<EOS>
Would
a
man
hesitate
at
a
lie
,
who
had
done
what
I
saw
YOU
do
 
who
had
behaved
about
it
afterwards
,
as
I
saw
YOU
behave
?
<EOS>
I
tell
you
again
,
I
shrank
from
the
horror
of
hearing
you
lie
,
after
the
horror
of
seeing
you
thieve
.
<EOS>
You
talk
as
if
this
was
a
misunderstanding
which
a
few
words
might
have
set
right
!
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
the
misunderstanding
is
at
an
end
.
<EOS>
Is
the
thing
set
right
?
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
the
thing
is
just
where
it
was
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
believe
you
NOW
!
<EOS>
I
do
n't
believe
you
found
the
nightgown
<EOS>
,
I
do
n't
believe
in
Rosanna
Spearman
's
letter
,
I
do
n't
believe
a
word
you
have
said
.
<EOS>
You
stole
it
 
<EOS>
I
saw
you
!
<EOS>
You
affected
to
help
the
police
 
<EOS>
I
saw
you
!
<EOS>
You
pledged
the
Diamond
to
the
money
-
lender
in
London
 
<EOS>
I
am
sure
of
it
!
<EOS>
You
cast
the
suspicion
of
your
disgrace
(
thanks
to
my
base
silence
!
)
<EOS>
on
an
innocent
man
!
<EOS>
You
fled
to
the
Continent
with
your
plunder
the
next
morning
!
<EOS>
After
all
that
vileness
,
there
was
but
one
thing
more
you
COULD
do
.
<EOS>
You
could
come
here
with
a
last
falsehood
on
your
lips
 
you
could
come
here
,
and
tell
me
that
I
have
wronged
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
If
I
had
stayed
a
moment
more
,
I
know
not
what
words
might
have
escaped
me
which
I
should
have
remembered
with
vain
repentance
and
regret
.
<EOS>
I
passed
by
her
,
and
opened
the
door
for
the
second
time
.
<EOS>
For
the
second
time
 
with
the
frantic
perversity
of
a
roused
woman
 
she
caught
me
by
the
arm
,
and
barred
my
way
out
.
  
<EOS>
"
Let
me
go
,
Rachel
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
It
will
be
better
for
both
of
us
.
<EOS>
Let
me
go
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
hysterical
passion
swelled
in
her
bosom
 
her
quickened
convulsive
breathing
almost
beat
on
my
face
,
as
she
held
me
back
at
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
did
you
come
here
?
<EOS>
"
she
persisted
,
desperately
.
<EOS>
"
I
ask
you
again
 
why
did
you
come
here
?
<EOS>
Are
you
afraid
I
shall
expose
you
?
<EOS>
Now
you
are
a
rich
man
,
now
you
have
got
a
place
in
the
world
,
now
you
may
marry
the
best
lady
in
the
land
 
<EOS>
are
you
afraid
I
shall
say
the
words
which
I
have
never
said
yet
to
anybody
but
you
?
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
say
the
words
!
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
expose
you
!
<EOS>
I
am
worse
,
if
worse
can
be
,
than
you
are
yourself
.
"
<EOS>
Sobs
and
tears
burst
from
her
.
<EOS>
She
struggled
with
them
fiercely
;
she
held
me
more
and
more
firmly
.
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
tear
you
out
of
my
heart
,
"
she
said
,
"
even
now
!
<EOS>
You
may
trust
in
the
shameful
,
shameful
weakness
which
can
only
struggle
against
you
in
this
way
!
"
<EOS>
She
suddenly
let
go
of
me
 
<EOS>
she
threw
up
her
hands
,
and
wrung
them
frantically
in
the
air
.
<EOS>
"
Any
other
woman
living
would
shrink
from
the
disgrace
of
touching
him
!
"
<EOS>
she
exclaimed
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
God
!
<EOS>
I
despise
myself
even
more
heartily
than
I
despise
HIM
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
tears
were
forcing
their
way
into
my
eyes
in
spite
of
me
 
the
horror
of
it
was
to
be
endured
no
longer
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
shall
know
that
you
have
wronged
me
,
yet
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
Or
you
shall
never
see
me
again
!
"
  
<EOS>
With
those
words
,
I
left
her
.
<EOS>
She
started
up
from
the
chair
on
which
she
had
dropped
the
moment
before
:
she
started
up
 
the
noble
creature
!
 
and
followed
me
across
the
outer
room
,
with
a
last
merciful
word
at
parting
.
  
<EOS>
"
Franklin
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
"
I
forgive
you
!
<EOS>
Oh
,
Franklin
,
Franklin
!
<EOS>
we
shall
never
meet
again
.
<EOS>
Say
you
forgive
ME
!
"
  
<EOS>
I
turned
,
so
as
to
let
my
face
show
her
that
I
was
past
speaking
 
<EOS>
I
turned
,
and
waved
my
hand
,
and
saw
her
dimly
,
as
in
a
vision
,
through
the
tears
that
had
conquered
me
at
last
.
  
<EOS>
The
next
moment
,
the
worst
bitterness
of
it
was
over
.
<EOS>
I
was
out
in
the
garden
again
.
<EOS>
I
saw
her
,
and
heard
her
,
no
more
.
    
<EOS>
Late
that
evening
,
I
was
surprised
at
my
lodgings
by
a
visit
from
Mr.
Bruff
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
noticeable
change
in
the
lawyer
's
manner
.
<EOS>
It
had
lost
its
usual
confidence
and
spirit
.
<EOS>
He
shook
hands
with
me
,
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
,
in
silence
.
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
going
back
to
Hampstead
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
,
by
way
of
saying
something
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
just
left
Hampstead
,
"
he
answered
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
,
Mr.
Franklin
,
that
you
have
got
at
the
truth
at
last
.
<EOS>
But
,
I
tell
you
plainly
,
if
I
could
have
foreseen
the
price
that
was
to
be
paid
for
it
,
I
should
have
preferred
leaving
you
in
the
dark
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
seen
Rachel
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
come
here
after
taking
her
back
to
Portland
Place
;
it
was
impossible
to
let
her
return
in
the
carriage
by
herself
.
<EOS>
I
can
hardly
hold
you
responsible
 
<EOS>
considering
that
you
saw
her
in
my
house
and
by
my
permission
 
for
the
shock
that
this
unlucky
interview
has
inflicted
on
her
.
<EOS>
All
I
can
do
is
to
provide
against
a
repetition
of
the
mischief
.
<EOS>
She
is
young
 
<EOS>
she
has
a
resolute
spirit
 
<EOS>
she
will
get
over
this
,
with
time
and
rest
to
help
her
.
<EOS>
I
want
to
be
assured
that
you
will
do
nothing
to
hinder
her
recovery
.
<EOS>
May
I
depend
on
your
making
no
second
attempt
to
see
her
 
except
with
my
sanction
and
approval
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
After
what
she
has
suffered
,
and
after
what
I
have
suffered
,
"
I
said
,
"
you
may
rely
on
me
.
"
  
"
I
have
your
promise
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
my
promise
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Bruff
looked
relieved
.
<EOS>
He
put
down
his
hat
,
and
drew
his
chair
nearer
to
mine
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
settled
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
Now
,
about
the
future
 
<EOS>
your
future
,
I
mean
.
<EOS>
To
my
mind
,
the
result
of
the
extraordinary
turn
which
the
matter
has
now
taken
is
briefly
this
.
<EOS>
In
the
first
place
,
we
are
sure
that
Rachel
has
told
you
the
whole
truth
,
as
plainly
as
words
can
tell
it
.
<EOS>
In
the
second
place
 
though
we
know
that
there
must
be
some
dreadful
mistake
somewhere
 
we
can
hardly
blame
her
for
believing
you
to
be
guilty
,
on
the
evidence
of
her
own
senses
;
backed
,
as
that
evidence
has
been
,
by
circumstances
which
appear
,
on
the
face
of
them
,
to
tell
dead
against
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
There
I
interposed
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
blame
Rachel
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
only
regret
that
she
could
not
prevail
on
herself
to
speak
more
plainly
to
me
at
the
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
might
as
well
regret
that
Rachel
is
not
somebody
else
,
"
rejoined
Mr.
Bruff
.
"
<EOS>
And
even
then
,
I
doubt
if
a
girl
of
any
delicacy
,
whose
heart
had
been
set
on
marrying
you
,
could
have
brought
herself
to
charge
you
to
your
face
with
being
a
thief
.
<EOS>
Anyhow
,
it
was
not
in
Rachel
's
nature
to
do
it
.
<EOS>
In
a
very
different
matter
to
this
matter
of
yours
 
which
placed
her
,
however
,
in
a
position
not
altogether
unlike
her
position
towards
you
 
<EOS>
I
happen
to
know
that
she
was
influenced
by
a
similar
motive
to
the
motive
which
actuated
her
conduct
in
your
case
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
as
she
told
me
herself
,
on
our
way
to
town
this
evening
,
if
she
had
spoken
plainly
,
she
would
no
more
have
believed
your
denial
then
than
she
believes
it
now
.
<EOS>
What
answer
can
you
make
to
that
?
<EOS>
There
is
no
answer
to
be
made
to
it
.
<EOS>
Come
,
come
,
Mr.
Franklin
!
<EOS>
my
view
of
the
case
has
been
proved
to
be
all
wrong
,
I
admit
 
<EOS>
but
,
as
things
are
now
,
my
advice
may
be
worth
having
for
all
that
.
<EOS>
I
tell
you
plainly
,
we
shall
be
wasting
our
time
,
and
cudgelling
our
brains
to
no
purpose
,
if
we
attempt
to
try
back
,
and
unravel
this
frightful
complication
from
the
beginning
.
<EOS>
Let
us
close
our
minds
resolutely
to
all
that
happened
last
year
at
Lady
Verinder
's
country
house
;
and
let
us
look
to
what
we
CAN
discover
in
the
future
,
instead
of
to
what
we
can
NOT
discover
in
the
past
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Surely
you
forget
,
"
I
said
,
"
that
the
whole
thing
is
essentially
a
matter
of
the
past
 
so
far
as
I
am
concerned
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Answer
me
this
,
"
retorted
Mr.
Bruff
.
<EOS>
"
Is
the
Moonstone
at
the
bottom
of
all
the
mischief
 
or
is
it
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
 
of
course
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
good
.
<EOS>
What
do
we
believe
was
done
with
the
Moonstone
,
when
it
was
taken
to
London
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
pledged
to
Mr.
Luker
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
know
that
you
are
not
the
person
who
pledged
it
.
<EOS>
Do
we
know
who
did
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Where
do
we
believe
the
Moonstone
to
be
now
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Deposited
in
the
keeping
of
Mr.
Luker
's
bankers
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Exactly
.
<EOS>
Now
observe
.
<EOS>
We
are
already
in
the
month
of
June
.
<EOS>
Towards
the
end
of
the
month
(
I
ca
n't
be
particular
to
a
day
)
<EOS>
a
year
will
have
elapsed
from
the
time
when
we
believe
the
jewel
to
have
been
pledged
.
<EOS>
There
is
a
chance
 
to
say
the
least
 
that
the
person
who
pawned
it
,
may
be
prepared
to
redeem
it
when
the
year
's
time
has
expired
.
<EOS>
If
he
redeems
it
,
Mr.
Luker
must
himself
 
<EOS>
according
to
the
terms
of
his
own
arrangement
 
take
the
Diamond
out
of
his
banker
's
hands
.
<EOS>
Under
these
circumstances
,
I
propose
setting
a
watch
at
the
bank
,
as
the
present
month
draws
to
an
end
,
and
discovering
who
the
person
is
to
whom
Mr.
Luker
restores
the
Moonstone
.
<EOS>
Do
you
see
it
now
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
admitted
(
a
little
unwillingly
)
that
the
idea
was
a
new
one
,
at
any
rate
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
Mr.
Murthwaite
's
idea
quite
as
much
as
mine
,
"
said
Mr.
Bruff
.
<EOS>
"
It
might
have
never
entered
my
head
,
but
for
a
conversation
we
had
together
some
time
since
.
<EOS>
If
Mr.
Murthwaite
is
right
,
the
Indians
are
likely
to
be
on
the
lookout
at
the
bank
,
towards
the
end
of
the
month
too
 
and
something
serious
may
come
of
it
.
<EOS>
What
comes
of
it
does
n't
matter
to
you
and
me
except
as
it
may
help
us
to
lay
our
hands
on
the
mysterious
Somebody
who
pawned
the
Diamond
.
<EOS>
That
person
,
you
may
rely
on
it
,
is
responsible
<EOS>
(
I
do
n't
pretend
to
know
how
)
for
the
position
in
which
you
stand
at
this
moment
;
and
that
person
alone
can
set
you
right
in
Rachel
's
estimation
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
deny
,
"
I
said
,
"
that
the
plan
you
propose
meets
the
difficulty
in
a
way
that
is
very
daring
,
and
very
ingenious
,
and
very
new
.
<EOS>
But
 
"
  
"
But
you
have
an
objection
to
make
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
My
objection
is
,
that
your
proposal
obliges
us
to
wait
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Granted
.
<EOS>
As
I
reckon
the
time
,
it
requires
you
to
wait
about
a
fortnight
 
more
or
less
.
<EOS>
Is
that
so
very
long
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
life
-
time
,
Mr.
Bruff
,
in
such
a
situation
as
mine
.
<EOS>
My
existence
will
be
simply
unendurable
to
me
,
unless
I
do
something
towards
clearing
my
character
at
once
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
well
,
I
understand
that
.
<EOS>
Have
you
thought
yet
of
what
you
can
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
thought
of
consulting
Sergeant
Cuff
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
has
retired
from
the
police
.
<EOS>
It
's
useless
to
expect
the
Sergeant
to
help
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
where
to
find
him
;
and
I
can
but
try
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Try
,
"
said
Mr.
Bruff
,
after
a
moment
's
consideration
.
<EOS>
"
The
case
has
assumed
such
an
extraordinary
aspect
since
Sergeant
Cuff
's
time
,
that
you
may
revive
his
interest
in
the
inquiry
.
<EOS>
Try
,
and
let
me
hear
the
result
.
<EOS>
In
the
meanwhile
,
"
he
continued
,
rising
,
"
if
you
make
no
discoveries
between
this
,
and
the
end
of
the
month
,
am
I
free
to
try
,
on
my
side
,
what
can
be
done
by
keeping
a
lookout
at
the
bank
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Certainly
,
"
I
answered
 
"
unless
I
relieve
you
of
all
necessity
for
trying
the
experiment
in
the
interval
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Bruff
smiled
,
and
took
up
his
hat
.
  
<EOS>
"
Tell
Sergeant
Cuff
,
"
he
rejoined
,
"
that
I
say
the
discovery
of
the
truth
depends
on
the
discovery
of
the
person
who
pawned
the
Diamond
.
<EOS>
And
let
me
hear
what
the
Sergeant
's
experience
says
to
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
So
we
parted
.
  
<EOS>
Early
the
next
morning
,
I
set
forth
for
the
little
town
of
Dorking
 
the
place
of
Sergeant
Cuff
's
retirement
,
as
indicated
to
me
by
Betteredge
.
  
<EOS>
Inquiring
at
the
hotel
,
I
received
the
necessary
directions
for
finding
the
Sergeant
's
cottage
.
<EOS>
It
was
approached
by
a
quiet
bye
-
road
,
a
little
way
out
of
the
town
,
and
it
stood
snugly
in
the
middle
of
its
own
plot
of
garden
ground
,
protected
by
a
good
brick
wall
at
the
back
and
the
sides
,
and
by
a
high
quickset
hedge
in
front
.
<EOS>
The
gate
,
ornamented
at
the
upper
part
by
smartly
-
painted
trellis
-
work
,
was
locked
.
<EOS>
After
ringing
at
the
bell
,
I
peered
through
the
trellis
-
work
,
and
saw
the
great
Cuff
's
favourite
flower
everywhere
;
blooming
in
his
garden
,
clustering
over
his
door
,
looking
in
at
his
windows
.
<EOS>
Far
from
the
crimes
and
the
mysteries
of
the
great
city
,
the
illustrious
thief
-
taker
was
placidly
living
out
the
last
Sybarite
years
of
his
life
,
smothered
in
roses
!
  
<EOS>
A
decent
elderly
woman
opened
the
gate
to
me
,
and
at
once
annihilated
all
the
hopes
I
had
built
on
securing
the
assistance
of
Sergeant
Cuff
.
<EOS>
He
had
started
,
only
the
day
before
,
on
a
journey
to
Ireland
.
  
<EOS>
"
Has
he
gone
there
on
business
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
  
<EOS>
The
woman
smiled
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
has
only
one
business
now
,
sir
,
"
she
said
;
"
and
that
's
roses
.
<EOS>
Some
great
man
's
gardener
in
Ireland
has
found
out
something
new
in
the
growing
of
roses
 
and
<EOS>
Mr.
Cuff
's
away
to
inquire
into
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
know
when
he
will
be
back
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
quite
uncertain
,
sir
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Cuff
said
he
should
come
back
directly
,
or
be
away
some
time
,
just
according
as
he
found
the
new
discovery
worth
nothing
,
or
worth
looking
into
.
<EOS>
If
you
have
any
message
to
leave
for
him
,
I
'll
take
care
,
sir
,
that
he
gets
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
gave
her
my
card
,
having
first
written
on
it
in
pencil
:
"
I
have
something
to
say
about
the
Moonstone
.
<EOS>
Let
me
hear
from
you
as
soon
as
you
get
back
.
<EOS>
"
That
done
,
there
was
nothing
left
but
to
submit
to
circumstances
,
and
return
to
London
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
irritable
condition
of
my
mind
,
at
the
time
of
which
I
am
now
writing
,
the
abortive
result
of
my
journey
to
the
Sergeant
's
cottage
simply
aggravated
the
restless
impulse
in
me
to
be
doing
something
.
<EOS>
On
the
day
of
my
return
from
Dorking
,
I
determined
that
the
next
morning
should
find
me
bent
on
a
new
effort
at
forcing
my
way
,
through
all
obstacles
,
from
the
darkness
to
the
light
.
  
<EOS>
What
form
was
my
next
experiment
to
take
?
  
<EOS>
If
the
excellent
Betteredge
had
been
present
while
I
was
considering
that
question
,
and
if
he
had
been
let
into
the
secret
of
my
thoughts
,
he
would
,
no
doubt
,
have
declared
that
the
German
side
of
me
was
,
on
this
occasion
,
my
uppermost
side
.
<EOS>
To
speak
seriously
,
it
is
perhaps
possible
that
my
German
training
was
in
some
degree
responsible
for
the
labyrinth
of
useless
speculations
in
which
I
now
involved
myself
.
<EOS>
For
the
greater
part
of
the
night
,
I
sat
smoking
,
and
building
up
theories
,
one
more
profoundly
improbable
than
another
.
<EOS>
When
I
did
get
to
sleep
,
my
waking
fancies
pursued
me
in
dreams
.
<EOS>
I
rose
the
next
morning
,
with
Objective
-
Subjective
and
Subjective
-
Objective
inextricably
entangled
together
in
my
mind
;
and
I
began
the
day
which
was
to
witness
my
next
effort
at
practical
action
of
some
kind
,
by
doubting
whether
I
had
any
sort
of
right
(
on
purely
philosophical
grounds
)
to
consider
any
sort
of
thing
(
the
Diamond
included
)
as
existing
at
all
.
  
<EOS>
How
long
I
might
have
remained
lost
in
the
mist
of
my
own
metaphysics
,
if
I
had
been
left
to
extricate
myself
,
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
say
.
<EOS>
As
the
event
proved
,
accident
came
to
my
rescue
,
and
happily
delivered
me
.
<EOS>
I
happened
to
wear
,
that
morning
,
the
same
coat
which
I
had
worn
on
the
day
of
my
interview
with
Rachel
.
<EOS>
Searching
for
something
else
in
one
of
the
pockets
,
I
came
upon
a
crumpled
piece
of
paper
,
and
,
taking
it
out
,
found
Betteredge
's
forgotten
letter
in
my
hand
.
  
<EOS>
It
seemed
hard
on
my
good
old
friend
to
leave
him
without
a
reply
.
<EOS>
I
went
to
my
writing
-
table
,
and
read
his
letter
again
.
  
<EOS>
A
letter
which
has
nothing
of
the
slightest
importance
in
it
,
is
not
always
an
easy
letter
to
answer
.
<EOS>
Betteredge
's
present
effort
at
corresponding
with
me
came
within
this
category
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Candy
's
assistant
,
otherwise
Ezra
Jennings
,
had
told
his
master
that
he
had
seen
me
;
and
Mr.
Candy
,
in
his
turn
,
wanted
to
see
me
and
say
something
to
me
,
when
I
was
next
in
the
neighbourhood
of
Frizinghall
.
<EOS>
What
was
to
be
said
in
answer
to
that
,
which
would
be
worth
the
paper
it
was
written
on
?
<EOS>
I
sat
idly
drawing
likenesses
from
memory
of
Mr.
Candy
's
remarkable
-
looking
assistant
,
on
the
sheet
of
paper
which
I
had
vowed
to
dedicate
to
Betteredge
 
until
it
suddenly
occurred
to
me
that
here
was
the
irrepressible
Ezra
Jennings
getting
in
my
way
again
!
<EOS>
I
threw
a
dozen
portraits
,
at
least
,
of
the
man
with
the
piebald
hair
(
the
hair
in
every
case
,
remarkably
like
)
,
into
the
waste
-
paper
basket
 
<EOS>
and
then
and
there
,
wrote
my
answer
to
Betteredge
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
perfectly
commonplace
letter
 
<EOS>
but
it
had
one
excellent
effect
on
me
.
<EOS>
The
effort
of
writing
a
few
sentences
,
in
plain
English
,
completely
cleared
my
mind
of
the
cloudy
nonsense
which
had
filled
it
since
the
previous
day
.
  
<EOS>
Devoting
myself
once
more
to
the
elucidation
of
the
impenetrable
puzzle
which
my
own
position
presented
to
me
,
I
now
tried
to
meet
the
difficulty
by
investigating
it
from
a
plainly
practical
point
of
view
.
<EOS>
The
events
of
the
memorable
night
being
still
unintelligible
to
me
,
I
looked
a
little
farther
back
,
and
searched
my
memory
of
the
earlier
hours
of
the
birthday
for
any
incident
which
might
prove
of
some
assistance
to
me
in
finding
the
clue
.
  
<EOS>
Had
anything
happened
while
Rachel
and
I
were
finishing
the
painted
door
?
<EOS>
or
,
later
,
when
I
rode
over
to
Frizinghall
?
<EOS>
or
afterwards
,
when
I
went
back
with
Godfrey
Ablewhite
and
his
sisters
?
<EOS>
or
,
later
again
,
when
I
put
the
Moonstone
into
Rachel
's
hands
?
<EOS>
or
,
later
still
,
when
the
company
came
,
and
we
all
assembled
round
the
dinner
-
table
?
<EOS>
My
memory
disposed
of
that
string
of
questions
readily
enough
,
until
I
came
to
the
last
.
<EOS>
Looking
back
at
the
social
event
of
the
birthday
dinner
,
I
found
myself
brought
to
a
standstill
at
the
outset
of
the
inquiry
.
<EOS>
I
was
not
even
capable
of
accurately
remembering
the
number
of
the
guests
who
had
sat
at
the
same
table
with
me
.
  
<EOS>
To
feel
myself
completely
at
fault
here
,
and
to
conclude
,
thereupon
,
that
the
incidents
of
the
dinner
might
especially
repay
the
trouble
of
investigating
them
,
formed
parts
of
the
same
mental
process
,
in
my
case
.
<EOS>
I
believe
other
people
,
in
a
similar
situation
,
would
have
reasoned
as
I
did
.
<EOS>
When
the
pursuit
of
our
own
interests
causes
us
to
become
objects
of
inquiry
to
ourselves
,
we
are
naturally
suspicious
of
what
we
do
n't
know
.
<EOS>
Once
in
possession
of
the
names
of
the
persons
who
had
been
present
at
the
dinner
,
I
resolved
 
as
a
means
of
enriching
the
deficient
resources
of
my
own
memory
 
to
appeal
to
the
memory
of
the
rest
of
the
guests
;
to
write
down
all
that
they
could
recollect
of
the
social
events
of
the
birthday
;
and
to
test
the
result
,
thus
obtained
,
by
the
light
of
what
had
happened
afterwards
,
when
the
company
had
left
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
This
last
and
newest
of
my
many
contemplated
experiments
in
the
art
of
inquiry
 
<EOS>
which
Betteredge
would
probably
have
attributed
to
the
clear
-
headed
,
or
French
,
side
of
me
being
uppermost
for
the
moment
 
may
fairly
claim
record
here
,
on
its
own
merits
.
<EOS>
Unlikely
as
it
may
seem
,
I
had
now
actually
groped
my
way
to
the
root
of
the
matter
at
last
.
<EOS>
All
I
wanted
was
a
hint
to
guide
me
in
the
right
direction
at
starting
.
<EOS>
Before
another
day
had
passed
over
my
head
,
that
hint
was
given
me
by
one
of
the
company
who
had
been
present
at
the
birthday
feast
!
  
<EOS>
With
the
plan
of
proceeding
which
I
now
had
in
view
,
it
was
first
necessary
to
possess
the
complete
list
of
the
guests
.
<EOS>
This
I
could
easily
obtain
from
Gabriel
Betteredge
.
<EOS>
I
determined
to
go
back
to
Yorkshire
on
that
day
,
and
to
begin
my
contemplated
investigation
the
next
morning
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
just
too
late
to
start
by
the
train
which
left
London
before
noon
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
alternative
but
to
wait
,
nearly
three
hours
,
for
the
departure
of
the
next
train
.
<EOS>
Was
there
anything
I
could
do
in
London
,
which
might
usefully
occupy
this
interval
of
time
?
  
<EOS>
My
thoughts
went
back
again
obstinately
to
the
birthday
dinner
.
  
<EOS>
Though
I
had
forgotten
the
numbers
,
and
,
in
many
cases
,
the
names
of
the
guests
,
I
remembered
readily
enough
that
by
far
the
larger
proportion
of
them
came
from
Frizinghall
,
or
from
its
neighbourhood
.
<EOS>
But
the
larger
proportion
was
not
all
.
<EOS>
Some
few
of
us
were
not
regular
residents
in
the
country
.
<EOS>
I
myself
was
one
of
the
few
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Murthwaite
was
another
.
<EOS>
Godfrey
Ablewhite
was
a
third
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bruff
 
<EOS>
no
<EOS>
:
I
called
to
mind
that
business
had
prevented
Mr.
Bruff
from
making
one
of
the
party
.
<EOS>
Had
any
ladies
been
present
,
whose
usual
residence
was
in
London
?
<EOS>
I
could
only
remember
Miss
Clack
as
coming
within
this
latter
category
.
<EOS>
However
,
here
were
three
of
the
guests
,
at
any
rate
,
whom
it
was
clearly
advisable
for
me
to
see
before
I
left
town
.
<EOS>
I
drove
off
at
once
to
Mr.
Bruff
's
office
;
not
knowing
the
addresses
of
the
persons
of
whom
I
was
in
search
,
and
thinking
it
probable
that
he
might
put
me
in
the
way
of
finding
them
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Bruff
proved
to
be
too
busy
to
give
me
more
than
a
minute
of
his
valuable
time
.
<EOS>
In
that
minute
,
however
,
he
contrived
to
dispose
 
in
the
most
discouraging
manner
 
of
all
the
questions
I
had
to
put
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
first
place
,
he
considered
my
newly
-
discovered
method
of
finding
a
clue
to
the
mystery
as
something
too
purely
fanciful
to
be
seriously
discussed
.
<EOS>
In
the
second
,
third
,
and
fourth
places
,
Mr.
Murthwaite
was
now
on
his
way
back
to
the
scene
of
his
past
adventures
;
Miss
Clack
had
suffered
losses
,
and
had
settled
,
from
motives
of
economy
,
in
France
;
Mr.
Godfrey
Ablewhite
might
,
or
might
not
,
be
discoverable
somewhere
in
London
.
<EOS>
Suppose
I
inquired
at
his
club
?
<EOS>
And
suppose
I
excused
Mr.
Bruff
,
if
he
went
back
to
his
business
and
wished
me
good
morning
?
  
<EOS>
The
field
of
inquiry
in
London
,
being
now
so
narrowed
as
only
to
include
the
one
necessity
of
discovering
Godfrey
's
address
,
I
took
the
lawyer
's
hint
,
and
drove
to
his
club
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
hall
,
I
met
with
one
of
the
members
,
who
was
an
old
friend
of
my
cousin
's
,
and
who
was
also
an
acquaintance
of
my
own
.
<EOS>
This
gentleman
,
after
enlightening
me
on
the
subject
of
Godfrey
's
address
,
told
me
of
two
recent
events
in
his
life
,
which
were
of
some
importance
in
themselves
,
and
which
had
not
previously
reached
my
ears
.
  
<EOS>
It
appeared
that
Godfrey
,
far
from
being
discouraged
by
Rachel
's
withdrawal
from
her
engagement
to
him
had
made
matrimonial
advances
soon
afterwards
to
another
young
lady
,
reputed
to
be
a
great
heiress
.
<EOS>
His
suit
had
prospered
,
and
his
marriage
had
been
considered
as
a
settled
and
certain
thing
.
<EOS>
But
,
here
again
,
the
engagement
had
been
suddenly
and
unexpectedly
broken
off
 
owing
,
it
was
said
,
on
this
occasion
,
to
a
serious
difference
of
opinion
between
the
bridegroom
and
the
lady
's
father
,
on
the
question
of
settlements
.
  
<EOS>
As
some
compensation
for
this
second
matrimonial
disaster
,
Godfrey
had
soon
afterwards
found
himself
the
object
of
fond
pecuniary
remembrance
,
on
the
part
of
one
of
his
many
admirers
.
<EOS>
A
rich
old
lady
 
highly
respected
at
the
Mothers
'
Small
-
Clothes
-
Conversion
-
Society
,
and
a
great
friend
of
Miss
Clack
's
(
to
whom
she
left
nothing
but
a
mourning
ring
)
 
had
bequeathed
to
the
admirable
and
meritorious
Godfrey
a
legacy
of
five
thousand
pounds
.
<EOS>
After
receiving
this
handsome
addition
to
his
own
modest
pecuniary
resources
,
he
had
been
heard
to
say
that
he
felt
the
necessity
of
getting
a
little
respite
from
his
charitable
labours
,
and
that
his
doctor
prescribed
"
a
run
on
the
Continent
,
as
likely
to
be
productive
of
much
future
benefit
to
his
health
.
<EOS>
"
If
I
wanted
to
see
him
,
it
would
be
advisable
to
lose
no
time
in
paying
my
contemplated
visit
.
  
<EOS>
I
went
,
then
and
there
,
to
pay
my
visit
.
  
<EOS>
The
same
fatality
which
had
made
me
just
one
day
too
late
in
calling
on
Sergeant
Cuff
,
made
me
again
one
day
too
late
in
calling
on
Godfrey
.
<EOS>
He
had
left
London
,
on
the
previous
morning
,
by
the
tidal
train
,
for
Dover
.
<EOS>
He
was
to
cross
to
Ostend
;
and
his
servant
believed
he
was
going
on
to
Brussels
.
<EOS>
The
time
of
his
return
was
rather
uncertain
;
but
I
might
be
sure
he
would
be
away
at
least
three
months
.
  
<EOS>
I
went
back
to
my
lodgings
a
little
depressed
in
spirits
.
<EOS>
Three
of
the
guests
at
the
birthday
dinner
 
and
those
three
<EOS>
all
exceptionally
intelligent
people
 
were
out
of
my
reach
,
at
the
very
time
when
it
was
most
important
to
be
able
to
communicate
with
them
.
<EOS>
My
last
hopes
now
rested
on
Betteredge
,
and
on
the
friends
of
the
late
Lady
Verinder
whom
I
might
still
find
living
in
the
neighbourhood
of
Rachel
's
country
house
.
  
<EOS>
On
this
occasion
,
I
travelled
straight
to
Frizinghall
 
<EOS>
the
town
being
now
the
central
point
in
my
field
of
inquiry
.
<EOS>
I
arrived
too
late
in
the
evening
to
be
able
to
communicate
with
Betteredge
.
<EOS>
The
next
morning
,
I
sent
a
messenger
with
a
letter
,
requesting
him
to
join
me
at
the
hotel
,
at
his
earliest
convenience
.
  
<EOS>
Having
taken
the
precaution
 
partly
to
save
time
,
partly
to
accommodate
Betteredge
 
of
sending
my
messenger
in
a
fly
,
I
had
a
reasonable
prospect
,
if
no
delays
occurred
,
of
seeing
the
old
man
within
less
than
two
hours
from
the
time
when
I
had
sent
for
him
.
<EOS>
During
this
interval
,
I
arranged
to
employ
myself
in
opening
my
contemplated
inquiry
,
among
the
guests
present
at
the
birthday
dinner
who
were
personally
known
to
me
,
and
who
were
easily
within
my
reach
.
<EOS>
These
were
my
relatives
,
the
Ablewhites
,
and
Mr.
Candy
.
<EOS>
The
doctor
had
expressed
a
special
wish
to
see
me
,
and
the
doctor
lived
in
the
next
street
.
<EOS>
So
to
Mr.
Candy
I
went
first
.
  
<EOS>
After
what
Betteredge
had
told
me
,
I
naturally
anticipated
finding
traces
in
the
doctor
's
face
of
the
severe
illness
from
which
he
had
suffered
.
<EOS>
But
I
was
utterly
unprepared
for
such
a
change
as
I
saw
in
him
when
he
entered
the
room
and
shook
hands
with
me
.
<EOS>
His
eyes
were
dim
;
his
hair
had
turned
completely
grey
;
his
face
was
wizen
;
his
figure
had
shrunk
.
<EOS>
I
looked
at
the
once
lively
,
rattlepated
,
humorous
little
doctor
 
associated
in
my
remembrance
with
the
perpetration
of
incorrigible
social
indiscretions
and
innumerable
boyish
jokes
 
<EOS>
and
I
saw
nothing
left
of
his
former
self
,
but
the
old
tendency
to
vulgar
smartness
in
his
dress
.
<EOS>
The
man
was
a
wreck
;
but
his
clothes
and
his
jewellery
 
in
cruel
mockery
of
the
change
in
him
 
were
as
gay
and
as
gaudy
as
ever
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
often
thought
of
you
,
Mr.
Blake
,
"
he
said
;
"
and
I
am
heartily
glad
to
see
you
again
at
last
.
<EOS>
If
there
is
anything
I
can
do
for
you
,
pray
command
my
services
,
sir
 
pray
command
my
services
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
said
those
few
commonplace
words
with
needless
hurry
and
eagerness
,
and
with
a
curiosity
to
know
what
had
brought
me
to
Yorkshire
,
which
he
was
perfectly
 
I
might
say
childishly
 
incapable
of
concealing
from
notice
.
  
<EOS>
With
the
object
that
I
had
in
view
,
I
had
of
course
foreseen
the
necessity
of
entering
into
some
sort
of
personal
explanation
,
before
I
could
hope
to
interest
people
,
mostly
strangers
to
me
,
in
doing
their
best
to
assist
my
inquiry
.
<EOS>
On
the
journey
to
Frizinghall
I
had
arranged
what
my
explanation
was
to
be
 
<EOS>
and
I
seized
the
opportunity
now
offered
to
me
of
trying
the
effect
of
it
on
Mr.
Candy
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
in
Yorkshire
,
the
other
day
,
and
I
am
in
Yorkshire
again
now
,
on
rather
a
romantic
errand
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
matter
,
Mr.
Candy
,
in
which
the
late
Lady
Verinder
's
friends
all
took
some
interest
.
<EOS>
You
remember
the
mysterious
loss
of
the
Indian
Diamond
,
now
nearly
a
year
since
?
<EOS>
Circumstances
have
lately
happened
which
lead
to
the
hope
that
it
may
yet
be
found
 
and
I
am
interesting
myself
,
as
one
of
the
family
,
in
recovering
it
.
<EOS>
Among
the
obstacles
in
my
way
,
there
is
the
necessity
of
collecting
again
all
the
evidence
which
was
discovered
at
the
time
,
and
more
if
possible
.
<EOS>
There
are
peculiarities
in
this
case
which
make
it
desirable
to
revive
my
recollection
of
everything
that
happened
in
the
house
,
on
the
evening
of
Miss
Verinder
's
birthday
.
<EOS>
And
I
venture
to
appeal
to
her
late
mother
's
friends
who
were
present
on
that
occasion
,
to
lend
me
the
assistance
of
their
memories
 
<EOS>
"
  
I
had
got
as
far
as
that
in
rehearsing
my
explanatory
phrases
,
when
I
was
suddenly
checked
by
seeing
plainly
in
Mr.
Candy
's
face
that
my
experiment
on
him
was
a
total
failure
.
  
<EOS>
The
little
doctor
sat
restlessly
picking
at
the
points
of
his
fingers
all
the
time
I
was
speaking
.
<EOS>
His
dim
watery
eyes
were
fixed
on
my
face
with
an
expression
of
vacant
and
wistful
inquiry
very
painful
to
see
.
<EOS>
What
he
was
thinking
of
,
it
was
impossible
to
divine
.
<EOS>
The
one
thing
clearly
visible
was
that
I
had
failed
,
after
the
first
two
or
three
words
,
in
fixing
his
attention
.
<EOS>
The
only
chance
of
recalling
him
to
himself
appeared
to
lie
in
changing
the
subject
.
<EOS>
I
tried
a
new
topic
immediately
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
much
,
"
I
said
,
gaily
,
"
for
what
brings
me
to
Frizinghall
!
<EOS>
Now
,
Mr.
Candy
,
it
's
your
turn
.
<EOS>
You
sent
me
a
message
by
Gabriel
Betteredge
 
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
left
off
picking
at
his
fingers
,
and
suddenly
brightened
up
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
!
<EOS>
yes
!
<EOS>
yes
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
eagerly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
That
's
it
!
<EOS>
I
sent
you
a
message
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
Betteredge
duly
communicated
it
by
letter
,
"
I
went
on
.
<EOS>
"
You
had
something
to
say
to
me
,
the
next
time
I
was
in
your
neighbourhood
.
<EOS>
Well
,
Mr.
Candy
,
here
I
am
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Here
you
are
!
"
echoed
the
doctor
.
"
<EOS>
And
Betteredge
was
quite
right
.
<EOS>
I
had
something
to
say
to
you
.
<EOS>
That
was
my
message
.
<EOS>
Betteredge
is
a
wonderful
man
.
<EOS>
What
a
memory
!
<EOS>
At
his
age
,
what
a
memory
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
dropped
back
into
silence
,
and
began
picking
at
his
fingers
again
.
<EOS>
Recollecting
what
I
had
heard
from
Betteredge
about
the
effect
of
the
fever
on
his
memory
,
I
went
on
with
the
conversation
,
in
the
hope
that
I
might
help
him
at
starting
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
long
time
since
we
met
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
We
last
saw
each
other
at
the
last
birthday
dinner
my
poor
aunt
was
ever
to
give
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
it
!
"
cried
Mr.
Candy
.
<EOS>
"
The
birthday
dinner
!
"
<EOS>
He
started
impulsively
to
his
feet
,
and
looked
at
me
.
<EOS>
A
deep
flush
suddenly
overspread
his
faded
face
,
and
he
abruptly
sat
down
again
,
as
if
conscious
of
having
betrayed
a
weakness
which
he
would
fain
have
concealed
.
<EOS>
It
was
plain
,
pitiably
plain
,
that
he
was
aware
of
his
own
defect
of
memory
,
and
that
he
was
bent
on
hiding
it
from
the
observation
of
his
friends
.
  
<EOS>
Thus
far
he
had
appealed
to
my
compassion
only
.
<EOS>
But
the
words
he
had
just
said
 
few
as
they
were
 
roused
my
curiosity
instantly
to
the
highest
pitch
.
<EOS>
The
birthday
dinner
had
already
become
the
one
event
in
the
past
,
at
which
I
looked
back
with
strangely
-
mixed
feelings
of
hope
and
distrust
.
<EOS>
And
here
was
the
birthday
dinner
unmistakably
proclaiming
itself
as
the
subject
on
which
Mr.
Candy
had
something
important
to
say
to
me
!
  
<EOS>
I
attempted
to
help
him
out
once
more
.
<EOS>
But
,
this
time
,
my
own
interests
were
at
the
bottom
of
my
compassionate
motive
,
and
they
hurried
me
on
a
little
too
abruptly
,
to
the
end
I
had
in
view
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
nearly
a
year
now
,
"
I
said
,
"
since
we
sat
at
that
pleasant
table
.
<EOS>
Have
you
made
any
memorandum
 
in
your
diary
,
or
otherwise
 
of
what
you
wanted
to
say
to
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Candy
understood
the
suggestion
,
and
showed
me
that
he
understood
it
,
as
an
insult
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
require
no
memorandum
,
Mr.
Blake
,
"
he
said
,
stiffly
enough
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
such
a
very
old
man
,
yet
 
and
my
memory
(
thank
God
)
is
to
be
thoroughly
depended
on
!
"
  
<EOS>
It
is
needless
to
say
that
I
declined
to
understand
that
he
was
offended
with
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
could
say
the
same
of
my
memory
,
"
I
answered
.
<EOS>
"
When
I
try
to
think
of
matters
that
are
a
year
old
,
I
seldom
find
my
remembrance
as
vivid
as
I
could
wish
it
to
be
.
<EOS>
Take
the
dinner
at
Lady
Verinder
's
,
for
instance
 
"
  
Mr.
Candy
brightened
up
again
,
the
moment
the
allusion
passed
my
lips
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
the
dinner
,
the
dinner
at
Lady
Verinder
's
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
,
more
eagerly
than
ever
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
got
something
to
say
to
you
about
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
His
eyes
looked
at
me
again
with
the
painful
expression
of
inquiry
,
so
wistful
,
so
vacant
,
so
miserably
helpless
to
see
.
<EOS>
He
was
evidently
trying
hard
,
and
trying
in
vain
,
to
recover
the
lost
recollection
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
a
very
pleasant
dinner
,
"
he
burst
out
suddenly
,
with
an
air
of
saying
exactly
what
he
wanted
to
say
.
<EOS>
"
A
very
pleasant
dinner
,
Mr.
Blake
,
was
n't
it
?
"
<EOS>
He
nodded
and
smiled
,
and
appeared
to
think
,
poor
fellow
,
that
he
had
succeeded
in
concealing
the
total
failure
of
his
memory
,
by
a
well
-
timed
exertion
of
his
own
presence
of
mind
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
so
distressing
that
I
at
once
shifted
the
talk
 
deeply
as
I
was
interested
in
his
recovering
the
lost
remembrance
 
to
topics
of
local
interest
.
  
<EOS>
Here
,
he
got
on
glibly
enough
.
<EOS>
Trumpery
little
scandals
and
quarrels
in
the
town
,
some
of
them
as
much
as
a
month
old
,
appeared
to
recur
to
his
memory
readily
.
<EOS>
He
chattered
on
,
with
something
of
the
smooth
gossiping
fluency
of
former
times
.
<EOS>
But
there
were
moments
,
even
in
the
full
flow
of
his
talkativeness
,
when
he
suddenly
hesitated
 
looked
at
me
for
a
moment
with
the
vacant
inquiry
once
more
in
his
eyes
 
controlled
himself
 
and
went
on
again
.
<EOS>
I
submitted
patiently
to
my
martyrdom
(
it
is
surely
nothing
less
than
martyrdom
to
a
man
of
cosmopolitan
sympathies
,
to
absorb
in
silent
resignation
the
news
of
a
country
town
?
)
<EOS>
until
the
clock
on
the
chimney
-
piece
told
me
that
my
visit
had
been
prolonged
beyond
half
an
hour
.
<EOS>
Having
now
some
right
to
consider
the
sacrifice
as
complete
,
I
rose
to
take
leave
.
<EOS>
As
we
shook
hands
,
Mr.
Candy
reverted
to
the
birthday
festival
of
his
own
accord
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
so
glad
we
have
met
again
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
had
it
on
my
mind
 
<EOS>
I
really
had
it
on
my
mind
,
Mr.
Blake
,
to
speak
to
you
.
<EOS>
About
the
dinner
at
Lady
Verinder
's
,
you
know
?
<EOS>
A
pleasant
dinner
 
really
a
pleasant
dinner
now
,
was
n't
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
On
repeating
the
phrase
,
he
seemed
to
feel
hardly
as
certain
of
having
prevented
me
from
suspecting
his
lapse
of
memory
,
as
he
had
felt
on
the
first
occasion
.
<EOS>
The
wistful
look
clouded
his
face
again
:
and
,
after
apparently
designing
to
accompany
me
to
the
street
door
,
he
suddenly
changed
his
mind
,
rang
the
bell
for
the
servant
,
and
remained
in
the
drawing
-
room
.
  
<EOS>
I
went
slowly
down
the
doctor
's
stairs
,
feeling
the
disheartening
conviction
that
he
really
had
something
to
say
which
it
was
vitally
important
to
me
to
hear
,
and
that
he
was
morally
incapable
of
saying
it
.
<EOS>
The
effort
of
remembering
that
he
wanted
to
speak
to
me
was
,
but
too
evidently
,
the
only
effort
that
his
enfeebled
memory
was
now
able
to
achieve
.
  
<EOS>
Just
as
I
reached
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
,
and
had
turned
a
corner
on
my
way
to
the
outer
hall
,
a
door
opened
softly
somewhere
on
the
ground
floor
of
the
house
,
and
a
gentle
voice
said
behind
me
:
    
<EOS>
"
I
am
afraid
,
sir
,
you
find
Mr.
Candy
sadly
changed
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
turned
round
,
and
found
myself
face
to
face
with
Ezra
Jennings
.
    
<EOS>
The
doctor
's
pretty
housemaid
stood
waiting
for
me
,
with
the
street
door
open
in
her
hand
.
<EOS>
Pouring
brightly
into
the
hall
,
the
morning
light
fell
full
on
the
face
of
Mr.
Candy
's
assistant
when
I
turned
,
and
looked
at
him
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
impossible
to
dispute
Betteredge
's
assertion
that
the
appearance
of
Ezra
Jennings
,
speaking
from
a
popular
point
of
view
,
was
against
him
.
<EOS>
His
gipsy
-
complexion
,
his
fleshless
cheeks
,
his
gaunt
facial
bones
,
his
dreamy
eyes
,
his
extraordinary
parti
-
coloured
hair
,
the
puzzling
contradiction
between
his
face
and
figure
which
made
him
look
old
and
young
both
together
 
were
all
more
or
less
calculated
to
produce
an
unfavourable
impression
of
him
on
a
stranger
's
mind
.
<EOS>
And
yet
 
feeling
this
as
I
certainly
did
 
<EOS>
it
is
not
to
be
denied
that
Ezra
Jennings
made
some
inscrutable
appeal
to
my
sympathies
,
which
I
found
it
impossible
to
resist
.
<EOS>
While
my
knowledge
of
the
world
warned
me
to
answer
the
question
which
he
had
put
,
acknowledging
that
I
did
indeed
find
Mr.
Candy
sadly
changed
,
and
then
to
proceed
on
my
way
out
of
the
house
 
my
interest
in
Ezra
Jennings
held
me
rooted
to
the
place
,
and
gave
him
the
opportunity
of
speaking
to
me
in
private
about
his
employer
,
for
which
he
had
been
evidently
on
the
watch
.
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
walking
my
way
,
Mr.
Jennings
?
<EOS>
"
I
said
,
observing
that
he
held
his
hat
in
his
hand
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
going
to
call
on
my
aunt
,
Mrs.
Ablewhite
.
"
  
<EOS>
Ezra
Jennings
replied
that
he
had
a
patient
to
see
,
and
that
he
was
walking
my
way
.
  
<EOS>
We
left
the
house
together
.
<EOS>
I
observed
that
the
pretty
servant
girl
 
who
was
all
smiles
and
amiability
,
when
I
wished
her
good
morning
on
my
way
out
 
received
a
modest
little
message
from
Ezra
Jennings
,
relating
to
the
time
at
which
he
might
be
expected
to
return
,
with
pursed
-
up
lips
,
and
with
eyes
which
ostentatiously
looked
anywhere
rather
than
look
in
his
face
.
<EOS>
The
poor
wretch
was
evidently
no
favourite
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
Out
of
the
house
,
I
had
Betteredge
's
word
for
it
that
he
was
unpopular
everywhere
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
a
life
!
<EOS>
"
I
thought
to
myself
,
as
we
descended
the
doctor
's
doorsteps
.
  
<EOS>
Having
already
referred
to
Mr.
Candy
's
illness
on
his
side
,
Ezra
Jennings
now
appeared
determined
to
leave
it
to
me
to
resume
the
subject
.
<EOS>
His
silence
said
significantly
,
"
It
's
your
turn
now
.
<EOS>
"
I
,
too
,
had
my
reasons
for
referring
to
the
doctor
's
illness
:
and
I
readily
accepted
the
responsibility
of
speaking
first
.
  
<EOS>
"
Judging
by
the
change
I
see
in
him
,
"
I
began
,
"
Mr.
Candy
's
illness
must
have
been
far
more
serious
that
I
had
supposed
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
almost
a
miracle
,
"
said
Ezra
Jennings
,
"
that
he
lived
through
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Is
his
memory
never
any
better
than
I
have
found
it
to
-
day
?
<EOS>
He
has
been
trying
to
speak
to
me
 
"
  
"
Of
something
which
happened
before
he
was
taken
ill
?
"
<EOS>
asked
the
assistant
,
observing
that
I
hesitated
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
His
memory
of
events
,
at
that
past
time
,
is
hopelessly
enfeebled
,
"
said
Ezra
Jennings
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
almost
to
be
deplored
,
poor
fellow
,
that
even
the
wreck
of
it
remains
.
<EOS>
While
he
remembers
dimly
plans
that
he
formed
 
things
,
here
and
there
,
that
he
had
to
say
or
do
before
his
illness
 
<EOS>
he
is
perfectly
incapable
of
recalling
what
the
plans
were
,
or
what
the
thing
was
that
he
had
to
say
or
do
.
<EOS>
He
is
painfully
conscious
of
his
own
deficiency
,
and
painfully
anxious
,
as
you
must
have
seen
,
to
hide
it
from
observation
.
<EOS>
If
he
could
only
have
recovered
in
a
complete
state
of
oblivion
as
to
the
past
,
he
would
have
been
a
happier
man
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
we
should
all
be
happier
,
"
he
added
,
with
a
sad
smile
,
"
if
we
could
but
completely
forget
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
are
some
events
surely
in
all
men
's
lives
,
"
I
replied
,
"
the
memory
of
which
they
would
be
unwilling
entirely
to
lose
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
,
I
hope
,
to
be
said
of
most
men
,
Mr.
Blake
.
<EOS>
I
am
afraid
it
can
not
truly
be
said
of
ALL
.
<EOS>
Have
you
any
reason
to
suppose
that
the
lost
remembrance
which
Mr.
Candy
tried
to
recover
 
while
you
were
speaking
to
him
just
now
 
was
a
remembrance
which
it
was
important
to
YOU
that
he
should
recall
?
"
  
<EOS>
In
saying
those
words
,
he
had
touched
,
of
his
own
accord
,
on
the
very
point
upon
which
I
was
anxious
to
consult
him
.
<EOS>
The
interest
I
felt
in
this
strange
man
had
impelled
me
,
in
the
first
instance
,
to
give
him
the
opportunity
of
speaking
to
me
;
reserving
what
I
might
have
to
say
,
on
my
side
,
in
relation
to
his
employer
,
until
I
was
first
satisfied
that
he
was
a
person
in
whose
delicacy
and
discretion
I
could
trust
.
<EOS>
The
little
that
he
had
said
,
thus
far
,
had
been
sufficient
to
convince
me
that
I
was
speaking
to
a
gentleman
.
<EOS>
He
had
what
I
may
venture
to
describe
as
the
UNSOUGHT
SELF
-
POSSESSION
,
which
is
a
sure
sign
of
good
breeding
,
not
in
England
only
,
but
everywhere
else
in
the
civilised
world
.
<EOS>
Whatever
the
object
which
he
had
in
view
,
in
putting
the
question
that
he
had
just
addressed
to
me
,
I
felt
no
doubt
that
I
was
justified
 
so
far
 
in
answering
him
without
reserve
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
I
have
a
strong
interest
,
"
I
said
,
"
in
tracing
the
lost
remembrance
which
Mr.
Candy
was
unable
to
recall
.
<EOS>
May
I
ask
whether
you
can
suggest
to
me
any
method
by
which
I
might
assist
his
memory
?
"
  
<EOS>
Ezra
Jennings
looked
at
me
,
with
a
sudden
flash
of
interest
in
his
dreamy
brown
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Candy
's
memory
is
beyond
the
reach
of
assistance
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
tried
to
help
it
often
enough
since
his
recovery
,
to
be
able
to
speak
positively
on
that
point
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
disappointed
me
;
and
I
owned
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
confess
you
led
me
to
hope
for
a
less
discouraging
answer
than
that
,
"
I
said
.
  
<EOS>
Ezra
Jennings
smiled
.
<EOS>
"
It
may
not
,
perhaps
,
be
a
final
answer
,
Mr.
Blake
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
possible
to
trace
Mr.
Candy
's
lost
recollection
,
without
the
necessity
of
appealing
to
Mr.
Candy
himself
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Indeed
?
<EOS>
Is
it
an
indiscretion
,
on
my
part
,
to
ask
how
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
By
no
means
.
<EOS>
My
only
difficulty
in
answering
your
question
,
is
the
difficulty
of
explaining
myself
.
<EOS>
May
I
trust
to
your
patience
,
if
I
refer
once
more
to
Mr.
Candy
's
illness
:
and
if
I
speak
of
it
this
time
without
sparing
you
certain
professional
details
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Pray
go
on
!
<EOS>
You
have
interested
me
already
in
hearing
the
details
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
My
eagerness
seemed
to
amuse
 
perhaps
,
I
might
rather
say
,
to
please
him
.
<EOS>
He
smiled
again
.
<EOS>
We
had
by
this
time
left
the
last
houses
in
the
town
behind
us
.
<EOS>
Ezra
Jennings
stopped
for
a
moment
,
and
picked
some
wild
flowers
from
the
hedge
by
the
roadside
.
<EOS>
"
How
beautiful
they
are
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
simply
,
showing
his
little
nosegay
to
me
.
"
<EOS>
And
how
few
people
in
England
seem
to
admire
them
as
they
deserve
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
not
always
been
in
England
?
<EOS>
"
I
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
.
<EOS>
I
was
born
,
and
partly
brought
up
,
in
one
of
our
colonies
.
<EOS>
My
father
was
an
Englishman
;
but
my
mother
 
<EOS>
We
are
straying
away
from
our
subject
,
Mr.
Blake
;
and
it
is
my
fault
.
<EOS>
The
truth
is
,
I
have
associations
with
these
modest
little
hedgeside
flowers
 
<EOS>
It
does
n't
matter
;
we
were
speaking
of
Mr.
Candy
.
<EOS>
To
Mr.
Candy
let
us
return
.
"
  
<EOS>
Connecting
the
few
words
about
himself
which
thus
reluctantly
escaped
him
,
with
the
melancholy
view
of
life
which
led
him
to
place
the
conditions
of
human
happiness
in
complete
oblivion
of
the
past
,
I
felt
satisfied
that
the
story
which
I
had
read
in
his
face
was
,
in
two
particulars
at
least
,
the
story
that
it
really
told
.
<EOS>
He
had
suffered
as
few
men
suffer
;
and
there
was
the
mixture
of
some
foreign
race
in
his
English
blood
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
heard
,
I
dare
say
,
of
the
original
cause
of
Mr.
Candy
's
illness
?
"
<EOS>
he
resumed
.
<EOS>
"
The
night
of
Lady
Verinder
's
dinner
-
party
was
a
night
of
heavy
rain
.
<EOS>
My
employer
drove
home
through
it
in
his
gig
,
and
reached
the
house
wetted
to
the
skin
.
<EOS>
He
found
an
urgent
message
from
a
patient
,
waiting
for
him
;
and
he
most
unfortunately
went
at
once
to
visit
the
sick
person
,
without
stopping
to
change
his
clothes
.
<EOS>
I
was
myself
professionally
detained
,
that
night
,
by
a
case
at
some
distance
from
Frizinghall
.
<EOS>
When
I
got
back
the
next
morning
,
I
found
Mr.
Candy
's
groom
waiting
in
great
alarm
to
take
me
to
his
master
's
room
.
<EOS>
By
that
time
the
mischief
was
done
;
the
illness
had
set
in
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
illness
has
only
been
described
to
me
,
in
general
terms
,
as
a
fever
,
"
I
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
add
nothing
which
will
make
the
description
more
accurate
,
"
answered
Ezra
Jennings
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
From
first
to
last
the
fever
assumed
no
specific
form
.
<EOS>
I
sent
at
once
to
two
of
Mr.
Candy
's
medical
friends
in
the
town
,
both
physicians
,
to
come
and
give
me
their
opinion
of
the
case
.
<EOS>
They
agreed
with
me
that
it
looked
serious
;
but
they
both
strongly
dissented
from
the
view
I
took
of
the
treatment
.
<EOS>
We
differed
entirely
in
the
conclusions
which
we
drew
from
the
patient
's
pulse
.
<EOS>
The
two
doctors
,
arguing
from
the
rapidity
of
the
beat
,
declared
that
a
lowering
treatment
was
the
only
treatment
to
be
adopted
.
<EOS>
On
my
side
,
I
admitted
the
rapidity
of
the
pulse
,
but
I
also
pointed
to
its
alarming
feebleness
as
indicating
an
exhausted
condition
of
the
system
,
and
as
showing
a
plain
necessity
for
the
administration
of
stimulants
.
<EOS>
The
two
doctors
were
for
keeping
him
on
gruel
,
lemonade
,
barley
-
water
,
and
so
on
.
<EOS>
I
was
for
giving
him
champagne
,
or
brandy
,
ammonia
,
and
quinine
.
<EOS>
A
serious
difference
of
opinion
,
as
you
see
!
<EOS>
A
difference
between
two
physicians
of
established
local
repute
,
and
a
stranger
who
was
only
an
assistant
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
For
the
first
few
days
,
I
had
no
choice
but
to
give
way
to
my
elders
and
betters
;
the
patient
steadily
sinking
all
the
time
.
<EOS>
I
made
a
second
attempt
to
appeal
to
the
plain
,
undeniably
plain
,
evidence
of
the
pulse
.
<EOS>
Its
rapidity
was
unchecked
,
and
its
feebleness
had
increased
.
<EOS>
The
two
doctors
took
offence
at
my
obstinacy
.
<EOS>
They
said
,
"
Mr.
Jennings
,
either
we
manage
this
case
,
or
you
manage
it
.
<EOS>
Which
is
it
to
be
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I
said
,
"
Gentlemen
,
give
me
five
minutes
to
consider
,
and
that
plain
question
shall
have
a
plain
reply
.
<EOS>
"
When
the
time
expired
,
I
was
ready
with
my
answer
.
<EOS>
I
said
,
"
You
positively
refuse
to
try
the
stimulant
treatment
?
"
<EOS>
They
refused
in
so
many
words
.
<EOS>
"
I
mean
to
try
it
at
once
,
gentlemen
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Try
it
,
Mr.
Jennings
,
and
we
withdraw
from
the
case
.
<EOS>
"
I
sent
down
to
the
cellar
for
a
bottle
of
champagne
;
and
I
administered
half
a
tumbler
-
full
of
it
to
the
patient
with
my
own
hand
.
<EOS>
The
two
physicians
took
up
their
hats
in
silence
,
and
left
the
house
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
had
assumed
a
serious
responsibility
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
In
your
place
,
I
am
afraid
I
should
have
shrunk
from
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
In
my
place
,
Mr.
Blake
,
you
would
have
remembered
that
Mr.
Candy
had
taken
you
into
his
employment
,
under
circumstances
which
made
you
his
debtor
for
life
.
<EOS>
In
my
place
,
you
would
have
seen
him
sinking
,
hour
by
hour
;
and
you
would
have
risked
anything
,
rather
than
let
the
one
man
on
earth
who
had
befriended
you
,
die
before
your
eyes
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
suppose
that
I
had
no
sense
of
the
terrible
position
in
which
I
had
placed
myself
!
<EOS>
There
were
moments
when
I
felt
all
the
misery
of
my
friendlessness
,
all
the
peril
of
my
dreadful
responsibility
.
<EOS>
If
I
had
been
a
happy
man
,
if
I
had
led
a
prosperous
life
,
I
believe
I
should
have
sunk
under
the
task
I
had
imposed
on
myself
.
<EOS>
But
I
had
no
happy
time
to
look
back
at
,
no
past
peace
of
mind
to
force
itself
into
contrast
with
my
present
anxiety
and
suspense
 
<EOS>
and
I
held
firm
to
my
resolution
through
it
all
.
<EOS>
I
took
an
interval
in
the
middle
of
the
day
,
when
my
patient
's
condition
was
at
its
best
,
for
the
repose
I
needed
.
<EOS>
For
the
rest
of
the
four
-
and
-
twenty
hours
,
as
long
as
his
life
was
in
danger
,
I
never
left
his
bedside
.
<EOS>
Towards
sunset
,
as
usual
in
such
cases
,
the
delirium
incidental
to
the
fever
came
on
.
<EOS>
It
lasted
more
or
less
through
the
night
;
and
then
intermitted
,
at
that
terrible
time
in
the
early
morning
 
from
two
o'clock
to
five
 
when
the
vital
energies
even
of
the
healthiest
of
us
are
at
their
lowest
.
<EOS>
It
is
then
that
Death
gathers
in
his
human
harvest
most
abundantly
.
<EOS>
It
was
then
that
Death
<EOS>
and
I
fought
our
fight
over
the
bed
,
which
should
have
the
man
who
lay
on
it
.
<EOS>
I
never
hesitated
in
pursuing
the
treatment
on
which
I
had
staked
everything
.
<EOS>
When
wine
failed
,
I
tried
brandy
.
<EOS>
When
the
other
stimulants
lost
their
influence
,
I
doubled
the
dose
.
<EOS>
After
an
interval
of
suspense
 
the
like
of
which
I
hope
to
God
I
shall
never
feel
again
 
there
came
a
day
when
the
rapidity
of
the
pulse
slightly
,
but
appreciably
,
diminished
;
and
,
better
still
,
there
came
also
a
change
in
the
beat
 
an
unmistakable
change
to
steadiness
and
strength
.
<EOS>
THEN
,
I
knew
that
I
had
saved
him
;
and
then
I
own
I
broke
down
.
<EOS>
I
laid
the
poor
fellow
's
wasted
hand
back
on
the
bed
,
and
burst
out
crying
.
<EOS>
An
hysterical
relief
,
Mr.
Blake
 
nothing
more
!
<EOS>
Physiology
says
,
and
says
truly
,
that
some
men
are
born
with
female
constitutions
 
<EOS>
and
I
am
one
of
them
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
made
that
bitterly
professional
apology
for
his
tears
,
speaking
quietly
and
unaffectedly
,
as
he
had
spoken
throughout
.
<EOS>
His
tone
and
manner
,
from
beginning
to
end
,
showed
him
to
be
especially
,
almost
morbidly
,
anxious
not
to
set
himself
up
as
an
object
of
interest
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
may
well
ask
,
why
I
have
wearied
you
with
all
these
details
?
"
he
went
on
.
"
It
is
the
only
way
I
can
see
,
Mr.
Blake
,
of
properly
introducing
to
you
what
I
have
to
say
next
.
<EOS>
Now
you
know
exactly
what
my
position
was
,
at
the
time
of
Mr.
Candy
's
illness
,
you
will
the
more
readily
understand
the
sore
need
I
had
of
lightening
the
burden
on
my
mind
by
giving
it
,
at
intervals
,
some
sort
of
relief
.
<EOS>
I
have
had
the
presumption
to
occupy
my
leisure
,
for
some
years
past
,
in
writing
a
book
,
addressed
to
the
members
of
my
profession
 
<EOS>
a
book
on
the
intricate
and
delicate
subject
of
the
brain
and
the
nervous
system
.
<EOS>
My
work
will
probably
never
be
finished
;
and
it
will
certainly
never
be
published
.
<EOS>
It
has
none
the
less
been
the
friend
of
many
lonely
hours
;
and
it
helped
me
to
while
away
the
anxious
time
 
<EOS>
the
time
of
waiting
,
and
nothing
else
 
at
Mr.
Candy
's
bedside
.
<EOS>
I
told
you
he
was
delirious
,
I
think
?
<EOS>
And
I
mentioned
the
time
at
which
his
delirium
came
on
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
had
reached
a
section
of
my
book
,
at
that
time
,
which
touched
on
this
same
question
of
delirium
.
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
trouble
you
at
any
length
with
my
theory
on
the
subject
 
I
will
confine
myself
to
telling
you
only
what
it
is
your
present
interest
to
know
.
<EOS>
It
has
often
occurred
to
me
in
the
course
of
my
medical
practice
,
to
doubt
whether
we
can
justifiably
infer
 
in
cases
of
delirium
 
that
the
loss
of
the
faculty
of
speaking
connectedly
,
implies
of
necessity
the
loss
of
the
faculty
of
thinking
connectedly
as
well
.
<EOS>
Poor
Mr.
Candy
's
illness
gave
me
an
opportunity
of
putting
this
doubt
to
the
test
.
<EOS>
I
understand
the
art
of
writing
in
shorthand
;
and
I
was
able
to
take
down
the
patient
's
"
wanderings
'
,
exactly
as
they
fell
from
his
lips
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
see
,
Mr.
Blake
,
what
I
am
coming
to
at
last
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
saw
it
clearly
,
and
waited
with
breathless
interest
to
hear
more
.
  
<EOS>
"
At
odds
and
ends
of
time
,
"
Ezra
Jennings
went
on
,
"
I
reproduced
my
shorthand
notes
,
in
the
ordinary
form
of
writing
 
leaving
large
spaces
between
the
broken
phrases
,
and
even
the
single
words
,
as
they
had
fallen
disconnectedly
from
Mr.
Candy
's
lips
.
<EOS>
I
then
treated
the
result
thus
obtained
,
on
something
like
the
principle
which
one
adopts
in
putting
together
a
child
's
"
puzzle
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
all
confusion
to
begin
with
;
but
it
may
be
all
brought
into
order
and
shape
,
if
you
can
only
find
the
right
way
.
<EOS>
Acting
on
this
plan
,
I
filled
in
each
blank
space
on
the
paper
,
with
what
the
words
or
phrases
on
either
side
of
it
suggested
to
me
as
the
speaker
's
meaning
;
altering
over
and
over
again
,
until
my
additions
followed
naturally
on
the
spoken
words
which
came
before
them
,
and
fitted
naturally
into
the
spoken
words
which
came
after
them
.
<EOS>
The
result
was
,
that
I
not
only
occupied
in
this
way
many
vacant
and
anxious
hours
,
but
that
I
arrived
at
something
which
was
(
as
it
seemed
to
me
)
<EOS>
a
confirmation
of
the
theory
that
I
held
.
<EOS>
In
plainer
words
,
after
putting
the
broken
sentences
together
I
found
the
superior
faculty
of
thinking
going
on
,
more
or
less
connectedly
,
in
my
patient
's
mind
,
while
the
inferior
faculty
of
expression
was
in
a
state
of
almost
complete
incapacity
and
confusion
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
One
word
!
"
<EOS>
I
interposed
eagerly
.
<EOS>
"
Did
my
name
occur
in
any
of
his
wanderings
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
shall
hear
,
Mr.
Blake
.
<EOS>
Among
my
written
proofs
of
the
assertion
which
I
have
just
advanced
 
or
,
I
ought
to
say
,
among
the
written
experiments
,
tending
to
put
my
assertion
to
the
proof
 
<EOS>
there
IS
one
,
in
which
your
name
occurs
.
<EOS>
For
nearly
the
whole
of
one
night
,
Mr.
Candy
's
mind
was
occupied
with
SOMETHING
between
himself
and
you
.
<EOS>
I
have
got
the
broken
words
,
as
they
dropped
from
his
lips
,
on
one
sheet
of
paper
.
<EOS>
And
I
have
got
the
links
of
my
own
discovering
which
connect
those
words
together
,
on
another
sheet
of
paper
.
<EOS>
The
product
(
as
the
arithmeticians
would
say
)
is
an
intelligible
statement
 
first
,
of
something
actually
done
in
the
past
;
secondly
,
of
something
which
Mr.
Candy
contemplated
doing
in
the
future
,
if
his
illness
had
not
got
in
the
way
,
and
stopped
him
.
<EOS>
The
question
is
whether
this
does
,
or
does
not
,
represent
the
lost
recollection
which
he
vainly
attempted
to
find
when
you
called
on
him
this
morning
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Not
a
doubt
of
it
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I
answered
.
<EOS>
"
Let
us
go
back
directly
,
and
look
at
the
papers
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Quite
impossible
,
Mr.
Blake
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Put
yourself
in
my
position
for
a
moment
,
"
said
Ezra
Jennings
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Would
you
disclose
to
another
person
what
had
dropped
unconsciously
from
the
lips
of
your
suffering
patient
and
your
helpless
friend
,
without
first
knowing
that
there
was
a
necessity
to
justify
you
in
opening
your
lips
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
felt
that
he
was
unanswerable
,
here
;
but
I
tried
to
argue
the
question
,
nevertheless
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
conduct
in
such
a
delicate
matter
as
you
describe
,
"
I
replied
,
"
would
depend
greatly
on
whether
the
disclosure
was
of
a
nature
to
compromise
my
friend
or
not
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
disposed
of
all
necessity
for
considering
that
side
of
the
question
,
long
since
,
"
said
Ezra
Jennings
.
<EOS>
"
Wherever
my
notes
included
anything
which
Mr.
Candy
might
have
wished
to
keep
secret
,
those
notes
have
been
destroyed
.
<EOS>
My
manuscript
experiments
at
my
friend
's
bedside
,
include
nothing
,
now
,
which
he
would
have
hesitated
to
communicate
to
others
,
if
he
had
recovered
the
use
of
his
memory
.
<EOS>
In
your
case
,
I
have
every
reason
to
suppose
that
my
notes
contain
something
which
he
actually
wished
to
say
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
yet
,
you
hesitate
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
yet
,
I
hesitate
.
<EOS>
Remember
the
circumstances
under
which
I
obtained
the
information
which
I
possess
!
<EOS>
Harmless
as
it
is
,
I
can
not
prevail
upon
myself
to
give
it
up
to
you
,
unless
you
first
satisfy
me
that
there
is
a
reason
for
doing
so
.
<EOS>
He
was
so
miserably
ill
,
Mr.
Blake
!
<EOS>
and
he
was
so
helplessly
dependent
upon
Me
!
<EOS>
Is
it
too
much
to
ask
,
if
I
request
you
only
to
hint
to
me
what
your
interest
is
in
the
lost
recollection
 
or
<EOS>
what
you
believe
that
lost
recollection
to
be
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
To
have
answered
him
with
the
frankness
which
his
language
and
his
manner
both
claimed
from
me
,
would
have
been
to
commit
myself
to
openly
acknowledging
that
I
was
suspected
of
the
theft
of
the
Diamond
.
<EOS>
Strongly
as
Ezra
Jennings
had
intensified
the
first
impulsive
interest
which
I
had
felt
in
him
,
he
had
not
overcome
my
unconquerable
reluctance
to
disclose
the
degrading
position
in
which
I
stood
.
<EOS>
I
took
refuge
once
more
in
the
explanatory
phrases
with
which
I
had
prepared
myself
to
meet
the
curiosity
of
strangers
.
  
<EOS>
This
time
I
had
no
reason
to
complain
of
a
want
of
attention
on
the
part
of
the
person
to
whom
I
addressed
myself
.
<EOS>
Ezra
Jennings
listened
patiently
,
even
anxiously
,
until
I
had
done
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
to
have
raised
your
expectations
,
Mr.
Blake
,
only
to
disappoint
them
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
Throughout
the
whole
period
of
Mr.
Candy
's
illness
,
from
first
to
last
,
not
one
word
about
the
Diamond
escaped
his
lips
.
<EOS>
The
matter
with
which
I
heard
him
connect
your
name
has
,
I
can
assure
you
,
no
discoverable
relation
whatever
with
the
loss
or
the
recovery
of
Miss
Verinder
's
jewel
.
"
  
<EOS>
We
arrived
,
as
he
said
those
words
,
at
a
place
where
the
highway
along
which
we
had
been
walking
branched
off
into
two
roads
.
<EOS>
One
led
to
Mr.
Ablewhite
's
house
,
and
the
other
to
a
moorland
village
some
two
or
three
miles
off
.
<EOS>
Ezra
Jennings
stopped
at
the
road
which
led
to
the
village
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
way
lies
in
this
direction
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
really
and
truly
sorry
,
Mr.
Blake
,
that
I
can
be
of
no
use
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
His
voice
told
me
that
he
spoke
sincerely
.
<EOS>
His
soft
brown
eyes
rested
on
me
for
a
moment
with
a
look
of
melancholy
interest
.
<EOS>
He
bowed
,
and
went
,
without
another
word
,
on
his
way
to
the
village
.
  
<EOS>
For
a
minute
or
more
I
stood
and
watched
him
,
walking
farther
and
farther
away
from
me
;
carrying
farther
and
farther
away
with
him
what
I
now
firmly
believed
to
be
the
clue
of
which
I
was
in
search
.
<EOS>
He
turned
,
after
walking
on
a
little
way
,
and
looked
back
.
<EOS>
Seeing
me
still
standing
at
the
place
where
we
had
parted
,
he
stopped
,
as
if
doubting
whether
I
might
not
wish
to
speak
to
him
again
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
time
for
me
to
reason
out
my
own
situation
 
to
remind
myself
that
I
was
losing
my
opportunity
,
at
what
might
be
the
turning
point
of
my
life
,
and
all
to
flatter
nothing
more
important
than
my
own
self
-
esteem
!
<EOS>
There
was
only
time
to
call
him
back
first
,
and
to
think
afterwards
.
<EOS>
I
suspect
I
am
one
of
the
rashest
of
existing
men
.
<EOS>
I
called
him
back
 
<EOS>
and
then
I
said
to
myself
,
"
Now
there
is
no
help
for
it
.
<EOS>
I
must
tell
him
the
truth
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
retraced
his
steps
directly
.
<EOS>
I
advanced
along
the
road
to
meet
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Jennings
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
treated
you
quite
fairly
.
<EOS>
My
interest
in
tracing
Mr.
Candy
's
lost
recollection
is
not
the
interest
of
recovering
the
Moonstone
.
<EOS>
A
serious
personal
matter
is
at
the
bottom
of
my
visit
to
Yorkshire
.
<EOS>
I
have
but
one
excuse
for
not
having
dealt
frankly
with
you
in
this
matter
.
<EOS>
It
is
more
painful
to
me
than
I
can
say
,
to
mention
to
anybody
what
my
position
really
is
.
"
  
<EOS>
Ezra
Jennings
looked
at
me
with
the
first
appearance
of
embarrassment
which
I
had
seen
in
him
yet
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
right
,
Mr.
Blake
,
and
no
wish
,
"
he
said
,
"
to
intrude
myself
into
your
private
affairs
.
<EOS>
Allow
me
to
ask
your
pardon
,
on
my
side
,
for
having
(
most
innocently
)
put
you
to
a
painful
test
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
a
perfect
right
,
"
I
rejoined
,
"
to
fix
the
terms
on
which
you
feel
justified
in
revealing
what
you
heard
at
Mr.
Candy
's
bedside
.
<EOS>
I
understand
and
respect
the
delicacy
which
influences
you
in
this
matter
.
<EOS>
How
can
I
expect
to
be
taken
into
your
confidence
if
I
decline
to
admit
you
into
mine
?
<EOS>
You
ought
to
know
,
and
you
shall
know
,
why
I
am
interested
in
discovering
what
Mr.
Candy
wanted
to
say
to
me
.
<EOS>
If
I
turn
out
to
be
mistaken
in
my
anticipations
,
and
if
you
prove
unable
to
help
me
when
you
are
really
aware
of
what
I
want
,
I
shall
trust
to
your
honour
to
keep
my
secret
 
and
something
tells
me
that
I
shall
not
trust
in
vain
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Stop
,
Mr.
Blake
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
word
to
say
,
which
must
be
said
before
you
go
any
farther
.
<EOS>
"
I
looked
at
him
in
astonishment
.
<EOS>
The
grip
of
some
terrible
emotion
seemed
to
have
seized
him
,
and
shaken
him
to
the
soul
.
<EOS>
His
gipsy
complexion
had
altered
to
a
livid
greyish
paleness
;
his
eyes
had
suddenly
become
wild
and
glittering
;
his
voice
had
dropped
to
a
tone
 
low
,
stern
,
and
resolute
 
which
I
now
heard
for
the
first
time
.
<EOS>
The
latent
resources
in
the
man
,
for
good
or
for
evil
 
<EOS>
it
was
hard
,
at
that
moment
,
to
say
which
 
leapt
up
in
him
and
showed
themselves
to
me
,
with
the
suddenness
of
a
flash
of
light
.
  
<EOS>
"
Before
you
place
any
confidence
in
me
,
"
he
went
on
,
"
you
ought
to
know
,
and
you
MUST
know
,
under
what
circumstances
I
have
been
received
into
Mr.
Candy
's
house
.
<EOS>
It
wo
n't
take
long
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
profess
,
sir
,
to
tell
my
story
(
as
the
phrase
is
)
to
any
man
.
<EOS>
My
story
will
die
with
me
.
<EOS>
All
I
ask
,
is
to
be
permitted
to
tell
you
,
what
I
have
told
Mr.
Candy
.
<EOS>
If
you
are
still
in
the
mind
,
when
you
have
heard
that
,
to
say
what
you
have
proposed
to
say
,
you
will
command
my
attention
and
command
my
services
.
<EOS>
Shall
we
walk
on
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
suppressed
misery
in
his
face
silenced
me
.
<EOS>
I
answered
his
question
by
a
sign
.
<EOS>
We
walked
on
.
  
<EOS>
After
advancing
a
few
hundred
yards
,
Ezra
Jennings
stopped
at
a
gap
in
the
rough
stone
wall
which
shut
off
the
moor
from
the
road
,
at
this
part
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
mind
resting
a
little
,
Mr.
Blake
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
what
I
was
 
and
some
things
shake
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
agreed
of
course
.
<EOS>
He
led
the
way
through
the
gap
to
a
patch
of
turf
on
the
heathy
ground
,
screened
by
bushes
and
dwarf
trees
on
the
side
nearest
to
the
road
,
and
commanding
in
the
opposite
direction
a
grandly
desolate
view
over
the
broad
brown
wilderness
of
the
moor
.
<EOS>
The
clouds
had
gathered
,
within
the
last
half
hour
.
<EOS>
The
light
was
dull
;
the
distance
was
dim
.
<EOS>
The
lovely
face
of
Nature
met
us
,
soft
and
still
colourless
 
met
us
without
a
smile
.
  
<EOS>
We
sat
down
in
silence
.
<EOS>
Ezra
Jennings
laid
aside
his
hat
,
and
passed
his
hand
wearily
over
his
forehead
,
wearily
through
his
startling
white
and
black
hair
.
<EOS>
He
tossed
his
little
nosegay
of
wild
flowers
away
from
him
,
as
if
the
remembrances
which
it
recalled
were
remembrances
which
hurt
him
now
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Blake
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
suddenly
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
in
bad
company
.
<EOS>
The
cloud
of
a
horrible
accusation
has
rested
on
me
for
years
.
<EOS>
I
tell
you
the
worst
at
once
.
<EOS>
I
am
a
man
whose
life
is
a
wreck
,
and
whose
character
is
gone
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
attempted
to
speak
.
<EOS>
He
stopped
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
Pardon
me
;
not
yet
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
commit
yourself
to
expressions
of
sympathy
which
you
may
afterwards
wish
to
recall
.
<EOS>
I
have
mentioned
an
accusation
which
has
rested
on
me
for
years
.
<EOS>
There
are
circumstances
in
connexion
with
it
that
tell
against
me
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
bring
myself
to
acknowledge
what
the
accusation
is
.
<EOS>
And
I
am
incapable
,
perfectly
incapable
,
of
proving
my
innocence
.
<EOS>
I
can
only
assert
my
innocence
.
<EOS>
I
assert
it
,
sir
,
on
my
oath
,
as
a
Christian
.
<EOS>
It
is
useless
to
appeal
to
my
honour
as
a
man
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
paused
again
.
<EOS>
I
looked
round
at
him
.
<EOS>
He
never
looked
at
me
in
return
.
<EOS>
His
whole
being
seemed
to
be
absorbed
in
the
agony
of
recollecting
,
and
in
the
effort
to
speak
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
much
that
I
might
say
,
"
he
went
on
,
"
about
the
merciless
treatment
of
me
by
my
own
family
,
and
the
merciless
enmity
to
which
I
have
fallen
a
victim
.
<EOS>
But
the
harm
is
done
;
the
wrong
is
beyond
all
remedy
.
<EOS>
I
decline
to
weary
or
distress
you
,
sir
,
if
I
can
help
it
.
<EOS>
At
the
outset
of
my
career
in
this
country
,
the
vile
slander
to
which
I
have
referred
struck
me
down
at
once
and
for
ever
.
<EOS>
I
resigned
my
aspirations
in
my
profession
 
<EOS>
obscurity
was
the
only
hope
left
for
me
.
<EOS>
I
parted
with
the
woman
I
loved
 
<EOS>
how
could
I
condemn
her
to
share
my
disgrace
?
<EOS>
A
medical
assistant
's
place
offered
itself
,
in
a
remote
corner
of
England
.
<EOS>
I
got
the
place
.
<EOS>
It
promised
me
peace
;
it
promised
me
obscurity
,
as
I
thought
.
<EOS>
I
was
wrong
.
<EOS>
Evil
report
,
with
time
and
chance
to
help
it
,
travels
patiently
,
and
travels
far
.
<EOS>
The
accusation
from
which
I
had
fled
followed
me
.
<EOS>
I
got
warning
of
its
approach
.
<EOS>
I
was
able
to
leave
my
situation
voluntarily
,
with
the
testimonials
that
I
had
earned
.
<EOS>
They
got
me
another
situation
in
another
remote
district
.
<EOS>
Time
passed
again
;
and
again
the
slander
that
was
death
to
my
character
found
me
out
.
<EOS>
On
this
occasion
I
had
no
warning
.
<EOS>
My
employer
said
,
"
Mr.
Jennings
,
I
have
no
complaint
to
make
against
you
;
but
you
must
set
yourself
right
,
or
leave
me
.
<EOS>
"
I
had
but
one
choice
 
<EOS>
I
left
him
.
<EOS>
It
's
useless
to
dwell
on
what
I
suffered
after
that
.
<EOS>
I
am
only
forty
years
old
now
.
<EOS>
Look
at
my
face
,
and
let
it
tell
for
me
the
story
of
some
miserable
years
.
<EOS>
It
ended
in
my
drifting
to
this
place
,
and
meeting
with
Mr.
Candy
.
<EOS>
He
wanted
an
assistant
.
<EOS>
I
referred
him
,
on
the
question
of
capacity
,
to
my
last
employer
.
<EOS>
The
question
of
character
remained
.
<EOS>
I
told
him
what
I
have
told
you
 
and
more
.
<EOS>
I
warned
him
that
there
were
difficulties
in
the
way
,
even
if
he
believed
me
.
"
<EOS>
Here
,
as
elsewhere
,
"
I
said
"
I
scorn
the
guilty
evasion
of
living
under
an
assumed
name
:
I
am
no
safer
at
Frizinghall
than
at
other
places
from
the
cloud
that
follows
me
,
go
where
I
may
.
"
<EOS>
He
answered
,
"
I
do
n't
do
things
by
halves
 
<EOS>
I
believe
you
,
and
I
pity
you
.
<EOS>
If
you
will
risk
what
may
happen
,
I
will
risk
it
too
.
"
<EOS>
God
Almighty
bless
him
!
<EOS>
He
has
given
me
shelter
<EOS>
,
he
has
given
me
employment
,
he
has
given
me
rest
of
mind
 
<EOS>
and
I
have
the
certain
conviction
<EOS>
(
I
have
had
it
for
some
months
past
)
that
nothing
will
happen
now
to
make
him
regret
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
slander
has
died
out
?
<EOS>
"
I
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
slander
is
as
active
as
ever
.
<EOS>
But
when
it
follows
me
here
,
it
will
come
too
late
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
have
left
the
place
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
Mr.
Blake
 
<EOS>
I
shall
be
dead
.
<EOS>
For
ten
years
past
I
have
suffered
from
an
incurable
internal
complaint
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
disguise
from
you
that
I
should
have
let
the
agony
of
it
kill
me
long
since
,
but
for
one
last
interest
in
life
,
which
makes
my
existence
of
some
importance
to
me
still
.
<EOS>
I
want
to
provide
for
a
person
 
very
dear
to
me
 
whom
I
shall
never
see
again
.
<EOS>
My
own
little
patrimony
is
hardly
sufficient
to
make
her
independent
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
The
hope
,
if
I
could
only
live
long
enough
,
of
increasing
it
to
a
certain
sum
,
has
impelled
me
to
resist
the
disease
by
such
palliative
means
as
I
could
devise
.
<EOS>
The
one
effectual
palliative
in
my
case
,
is
 
opium
.
<EOS>
To
that
all
-
potent
and
all
-
merciful
drug
I
am
indebted
for
a
respite
of
many
years
from
my
sentence
of
death
.
<EOS>
But
even
the
virtues
of
opium
have
their
limit
.
<EOS>
The
progress
of
the
disease
has
gradually
forced
me
from
the
use
of
opium
to
the
abuse
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
am
feeling
the
penalty
at
last
.
<EOS>
My
nervous
system
is
shattered
;
my
nights
are
nights
of
horror
.
<EOS>
The
end
is
not
far
off
now
.
<EOS>
Let
it
come
 
I
have
not
lived
and
worked
in
vain
.
<EOS>
The
little
sum
is
nearly
made
up
;
and
I
have
the
means
of
completing
it
,
if
my
last
reserves
of
life
fail
me
sooner
than
I
expect
.
<EOS>
I
hardly
know
how
I
have
wandered
into
telling
you
this
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
think
I
am
mean
enough
to
appeal
to
your
pity
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
,
I
fancy
you
may
be
all
the
readier
to
believe
me
,
if
you
know
that
what
I
have
said
to
you
,
I
have
said
with
the
certain
knowledge
in
me
that
I
am
a
dying
man
.
<EOS>
There
is
no
disguising
,
Mr.
Blake
,
that
you
interest
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
attempted
to
make
my
poor
friend
's
loss
of
memory
the
means
of
bettering
my
acquaintance
with
you
.
<EOS>
I
have
speculated
on
the
chance
of
your
feeling
a
passing
curiosity
about
what
he
wanted
to
say
,
and
of
my
being
able
to
satisfy
it
.
<EOS>
Is
there
no
excuse
for
my
intruding
myself
on
you
?
<EOS>
Perhaps
there
is
some
excuse
.
<EOS>
A
man
who
has
lived
as
I
have
lived
has
his
bitter
moments
when
he
ponders
over
human
destiny
.
<EOS>
You
have
youth
,
health
,
riches
,
a
place
in
the
world
,
a
prospect
before
you
.
<EOS>
You
,
and
such
as
you
,
show
me
the
sunny
side
of
human
life
,
and
reconcile
me
with
the
world
that
I
am
leaving
,
before
I
go
.
<EOS>
However
this
talk
between
us
may
end
,
I
shall
not
forget
that
you
have
done
me
a
kindness
in
doing
that
.
<EOS>
It
rests
with
you
,
sir
,
to
say
what
you
proposed
saying
,
or
to
wish
me
good
morning
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
had
<EOS>
but
one
answer
to
make
to
that
appeal
.
<EOS>
Without
a
moment
's
hesitation
I
told
him
the
truth
,
as
unreservedly
as
I
have
told
it
in
these
pages
.
  
<EOS>
He
started
to
his
feet
,
and
looked
at
me
with
breathless
eagerness
as
I
approached
the
leading
incident
of
my
story
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
certain
that
I
went
into
the
room
,
"
I
said
;
"
it
is
certain
that
I
took
the
Diamond
.
<EOS>
I
can
only
meet
those
two
plain
facts
by
declaring
that
,
do
what
I
might
,
I
did
it
without
my
own
knowledge
 
"
  
<EOS>
Ezra
Jennings
caught
me
excitedly
by
the
arm
.
  
<EOS>
"
Stop
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
suggested
more
to
me
than
you
suppose
.
<EOS>
Have
you
ever
been
accustomed
to
the
use
of
opium
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
tasted
it
in
my
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Were
your
nerves
out
of
order
,
at
this
time
last
year
?
<EOS>
Were
you
unusually
restless
and
irritable
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
you
sleep
badly
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Wretchedly
.
<EOS>
Many
nights
I
never
slept
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Was
the
birthday
night
an
exception
?
<EOS>
Try
,
and
remember
.
<EOS>
Did
you
sleep
well
on
that
one
occasion
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
remember
!
<EOS>
I
slept
soundly
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
dropped
my
arm
as
suddenly
as
he
had
taken
it
 
and
looked
at
me
with
the
air
of
a
man
whose
mind
was
relieved
of
the
last
doubt
that
rested
on
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
This
is
a
marked
day
in
your
life
,
and
in
mine
,
"
he
said
,
gravely
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
absolutely
certain
,
Mr.
Blake
,
of
one
thing
 
I
have
got
what
Mr.
Candy
wanted
to
say
to
you
this
morning
,
in
the
notes
that
I
took
at
my
patient
's
bedside
.
<EOS>
Wait
!
<EOS>
that
is
not
all
.
<EOS>
I
am
firmly
persuaded
that
I
can
prove
you
to
have
been
unconscious
of
what
you
were
about
,
when
you
entered
the
room
and
took
the
Diamond
.
<EOS>
Give
me
time
to
think
,
and
time
to
question
you
.
<EOS>
I
believe
the
vindication
of
your
innocence
is
in
my
hands
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Explain
yourself
,
for
God
's
sake
!
<EOS>
What
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
In
the
excitement
of
our
colloquy
,
we
had
walked
on
a
few
steps
,
beyond
the
clump
of
dwarf
trees
which
had
hitherto
screened
us
from
view
.
<EOS>
Before
Ezra
Jennings
could
answer
me
,
he
was
hailed
from
the
high
road
by
a
man
,
in
great
agitation
,
who
had
been
evidently
on
the
look
-
out
for
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
coming
,
"
he
called
back
;
"
I
am
coming
as
fast
as
I
can
!
"
<EOS>
He
turned
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
There
is
an
urgent
case
waiting
for
me
at
the
village
yonder
;
I
ought
to
have
been
there
half
an
hour
since
 
I
must
attend
to
it
at
once
.
<EOS>
Give
me
two
hours
from
this
time
,
and
call
at
Mr.
Candy
's
again
 
and
I
will
engage
to
be
ready
for
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
am
I
to
wait
!
<EOS>
"
I
exclaimed
,
impatiently
.
"
<EOS>
Ca
n't
you
quiet
my
mind
by
a
word
of
explanation
before
we
part
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
This
is
far
too
serious
a
matter
to
be
explained
in
a
hurry
,
Mr.
Blake
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
wilfully
trying
your
patience
 
<EOS>
I
should
only
be
adding
to
your
suspense
,
if
I
attempted
to
relieve
it
as
things
are
now
.
<EOS>
At
Frizinghall
,
sir
,
in
two
hours
'
time
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
man
on
the
high
road
hailed
him
again
.
<EOS>
He
hurried
away
,
and
left
me
.
    
<EOS>
How
the
interval
of
suspense
in
which
I
was
now
condemned
might
have
affected
other
men
in
my
position
,
I
can
not
pretend
to
say
.
<EOS>
The
influence
of
the
two
hours
'
probation
upon
my
temperament
was
simply
this
.
<EOS>
I
felt
physically
incapable
of
remaining
still
in
any
one
place
,
and
morally
incapable
of
speaking
to
any
one
human
being
,
until
I
had
first
heard
all
that
Ezra
Jennings
had
to
say
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
In
this
frame
of
mind
,
I
not
only
abandoned
my
contemplated
visit
to
Mrs.
Ablewhite
 
<EOS>
I
even
shrank
from
encountering
Gabriel
Betteredge
himself
.
  
<EOS>
Returning
to
Frizinghall
,
I
left
a
note
for
Betteredge
,
telling
him
that
I
had
been
unexpectedly
called
away
for
a
few
hours
,
but
that
he
might
certainly
expect
me
to
return
towards
three
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
.
<EOS>
I
requested
him
,
in
the
interval
,
to
order
his
dinner
at
the
usual
hour
,
and
to
amuse
himself
as
he
pleased
.
<EOS>
He
had
,
as
I
well
knew
,
hosts
of
friends
in
Frizinghall
;
and
he
would
be
at
no
loss
how
to
fill
up
his
time
until
I
returned
to
the
hotel
.
  
<EOS>
This
done
,
I
made
the
best
of
my
way
out
of
the
town
again
,
and
roamed
the
lonely
moorland
country
which
surrounds
Frizinghall
,
until
my
watch
told
me
that
it
was
time
,
at
last
,
to
return
to
Mr.
Candy
's
house
.
  
<EOS>
I
found
Ezra
Jennings
ready
and
waiting
for
me
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
sitting
alone
in
a
bare
little
room
,
which
communicated
by
a
glazed
door
with
a
surgery
.
<EOS>
Hideous
coloured
diagrams
of
the
ravages
of
hideous
diseases
decorated
the
barren
buff
-
coloured
walls
.
<EOS>
A
book
-
case
filled
with
dingy
medical
works
,
and
ornamented
at
the
top
with
a
skull
,
in
place
of
the
customary
bust
;
a
large
deal
table
copiously
splashed
with
ink
;
wooden
chairs
of
the
sort
that
are
seen
in
kitchens
and
cottages
;
a
threadbare
drugget
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
;
a
sink
of
water
,
with
a
basin
and
waste
-
pipe
roughly
let
into
the
wall
,
horribly
suggestive
of
its
connection
with
surgical
operations
 
comprised
the
entire
furniture
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
The
bees
were
humming
among
a
few
flowers
placed
in
pots
outside
the
window
;
the
birds
were
singing
in
the
garden
,
and
the
faint
intermittent
jingle
of
a
tuneless
piano
in
some
neighbouring
house
forced
itself
now
and
again
on
the
ear
.
<EOS>
In
any
other
place
,
these
everyday
sounds
might
have
spoken
pleasantly
of
the
everyday
world
outside
.
<EOS>
Here
,
they
came
in
as
intruders
on
a
silence
which
nothing
but
human
suffering
had
the
privilege
to
disturb
.
<EOS>
I
looked
at
the
mahogany
instrument
case
,
and
at
the
huge
roll
of
lint
,
occupying
places
of
their
own
on
the
book
-
shelves
,
and
shuddered
inwardly
as
I
thought
of
the
sounds
,
familiar
and
appropriate
to
the
everyday
use
of
Ezra
Jennings
'
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
make
no
apology
,
Mr.
Blake
,
for
the
place
in
which
I
am
receiving
you
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
the
only
room
in
the
house
,
at
this
hour
of
the
day
,
in
which
we
can
feel
quite
sure
of
being
left
undisturbed
.
<EOS>
Here
are
my
papers
ready
for
you
;
and
here
are
two
books
to
which
we
may
have
occasion
to
refer
,
before
we
have
done
.
<EOS>
Bring
your
chair
to
the
table
,
and
we
shall
be
able
to
consult
them
together
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
drew
up
to
the
table
;
and
Ezra
Jennings
handed
me
his
manuscript
notes
.
<EOS>
They
consisted
of
two
large
folio
leaves
of
paper
.
<EOS>
One
leaf
contained
writing
which
only
covered
the
surface
at
intervals
.
<EOS>
The
other
presented
writing
,
in
red
and
black
ink
,
which
completely
filled
the
page
from
top
to
bottom
.
<EOS>
In
the
irritated
state
of
my
curiosity
,
at
that
moment
,
I
laid
aside
the
second
sheet
of
paper
in
despair
.
  
<EOS>
"
Have
some
mercy
on
me
!
"
<EOS>
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
Tell
me
what
I
am
to
expect
,
before
I
attempt
to
read
this
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Willingly
,
Mr.
Blake
!
<EOS>
Do
you
mind
my
asking
you
one
or
two
more
questions
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ask
me
anything
you
like
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
looked
at
me
with
the
sad
smile
on
his
lips
,
and
the
kindly
interest
in
his
soft
brown
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
already
told
me
,
"
he
said
,
"
that
you
have
never
 
to
your
knowledge
 
tasted
opium
in
your
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
To
my
knowledge
,
"
I
repeated
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
understand
directly
why
I
speak
with
that
reservation
.
<EOS>
Let
us
go
on
.
<EOS>
You
are
not
aware
of
ever
having
taken
opium
.
<EOS>
At
this
time
,
last
year
,
you
were
suffering
from
nervous
irritation
,
and
you
slept
wretchedly
at
night
.
<EOS>
On
the
night
of
the
birthday
,
however
,
there
was
an
exception
to
the
rule
 
you
slept
soundly
.
<EOS>
Am
I
right
,
so
far
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Quite
right
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Can
you
assign
any
cause
for
the
nervous
suffering
,
and
your
want
of
sleep
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
assign
no
cause
.
<EOS>
Old
Betteredge
made
a
guess
at
the
cause
,
I
remember
.
<EOS>
But
that
is
hardly
worth
mentioning
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Pardon
me
.
<EOS>
Anything
is
worth
mentioning
in
such
a
case
as
this
.
<EOS>
Betteredge
attributed
your
sleeplessness
to
something
.
<EOS>
To
what
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
To
my
leaving
off
smoking
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Had
you
been
an
habitual
smoker
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
you
leave
off
the
habit
suddenly
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Betteredge
was
perfectly
right
,
Mr.
Blake
.
<EOS>
When
smoking
is
a
habit
a
man
must
have
no
common
constitution
who
can
leave
it
off
suddenly
without
some
temporary
damage
to
his
nervous
system
.
<EOS>
Your
sleepless
nights
are
accounted
for
,
to
my
mind
.
<EOS>
My
next
question
refers
to
Mr.
Candy
.
<EOS>
Do
you
remember
having
entered
into
anything
like
a
dispute
with
him
 
at
the
birthday
dinner
,
or
afterwards
 
on
the
subject
of
his
profession
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
question
instantly
awakened
one
of
my
dormant
remembrances
in
connection
with
the
birthday
festival
.
<EOS>
The
foolish
wrangle
which
took
place
,
on
that
occasion
,
between
Mr.
Candy
and
myself
,
will
be
found
described
at
much
greater
length
than
it
deserves
in
the
tenth
chapter
of
Betteredge
's
Narrative
.
<EOS>
The
details
there
presented
of
the
dispute
 
so
little
<EOS>
had
I
thought
of
it
afterwards
 
entirely
failed
to
recur
to
my
memory
.
<EOS>
All
that
I
could
now
recall
,
and
all
that
I
could
tell
Ezra
Jennings
was
,
that
I
had
attacked
the
art
of
medicine
at
the
dinner
-
table
with
sufficient
rashness
and
sufficient
pertinacity
to
put
even
Mr.
Candy
out
of
temper
for
the
moment
.
<EOS>
I
also
remembered
that
Lady
Verinder
had
interfered
to
stop
the
dispute
,
and
that
the
little
doctor
and
I
had
"
made
it
up
again
,
"
as
the
children
say
,
and
had
become
as
good
friends
as
ever
,
before
we
shook
hands
that
night
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
one
thing
more
,
"
said
Ezra
Jennings
,
"
which
it
is
very
important
I
should
know
.
<EOS>
Had
you
any
reason
for
feeling
any
special
anxiety
about
the
Diamond
,
at
this
time
last
year
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
had
the
strongest
reasons
for
feeling
anxiety
about
the
Diamond
.
<EOS>
I
knew
it
to
be
the
object
of
a
conspiracy
;
and
I
was
warned
to
take
measures
for
Miss
Verinder
's
protection
,
as
the
possessor
of
the
stone
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Was
the
safety
of
the
Diamond
the
subject
of
conversation
between
you
and
any
other
person
,
immediately
before
you
retired
to
rest
on
the
birthday
night
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
the
subject
of
a
conversation
between
Lady
Verinder
and
her
daughter
 
"
  
"
Which
took
place
in
your
hearing
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
Ezra
Jennings
took
up
his
notes
from
the
table
,
and
placed
them
in
my
hands
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Blake
,
"
he
said
,
"
if
you
read
those
notes
now
,
by
the
light
which
my
questions
and
your
answers
have
thrown
on
them
,
you
will
make
two
astounding
discoveries
concerning
yourself
.
<EOS>
You
will
find
 
First
,
that
you
entered
Miss
Verinder
's
sitting
-
room
and
took
the
Diamond
,
in
a
state
of
trance
,
produced
by
opium
.
<EOS>
Secondly
,
that
the
opium
was
given
to
you
by
Mr.
Candy
 
without
your
own
knowledge
 
as
a
practical
refutation
of
the
opinions
which
you
had
expressed
to
him
at
the
birthday
dinner
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
sat
with
the
papers
in
my
hand
completely
stupefied
.
  
<EOS>
"
Try
and
forgive
poor
Mr.
Candy
,
"
said
the
assistant
gently
.
<EOS>
"
He
has
done
dreadful
mischief
,
I
own
;
but
he
has
done
it
innocently
.
<EOS>
If
you
will
look
at
the
notes
,
you
will
see
that
 
but
for
his
illness
 
he
would
have
returned
to
Lady
Verinder
's
the
morning
after
the
party
,
and
would
have
acknowledged
the
trick
that
he
had
played
you
.
<EOS>
Miss
Verinder
would
have
heard
of
it
,
and
Miss
Verinder
would
have
questioned
him
 
and
the
truth
which
has
laid
hidden
for
a
year
would
have
been
discovered
in
a
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
began
to
regain
my
self
-
possession
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Candy
is
beyond
the
reach
of
my
resentment
,
"
I
said
angrily
.
"
<EOS>
But
the
trick
that
he
played
me
is
not
the
less
an
act
of
treachery
,
for
all
that
.
<EOS>
I
may
forgive
,
but
I
shall
not
forget
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Every
medical
man
commits
that
act
of
treachery
,
Mr.
Blake
,
in
the
course
of
his
practice
.
<EOS>
The
ignorant
distrust
of
opium
(
in
England
)
is
by
no
means
confined
to
the
lower
and
less
cultivated
classes
.
<EOS>
Every
doctor
in
large
practice
finds
himself
,
every
now
and
then
,
obliged
to
deceive
his
patients
,
as
Mr.
Candy
deceived
you
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
defend
the
folly
of
playing
you
a
trick
under
the
circumstances
.
<EOS>
I
only
plead
with
you
for
a
more
accurate
and
more
merciful
construction
of
motives
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
was
it
done
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
<EOS>
"
Who
gave
me
the
laudanum
,
without
my
knowing
it
myself
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
able
to
tell
you
.
<EOS>
Nothing
relating
to
that
part
of
the
matter
dropped
from
Mr.
Candy
's
lips
,
all
through
his
illness
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
your
own
memory
may
point
to
the
person
to
be
suspected
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
useless
,
in
that
case
,
to
pursue
the
inquiry
.
<EOS>
The
laudanum
was
secretly
given
to
you
in
some
way
.
<EOS>
Let
us
leave
it
there
,
and
go
on
to
matters
of
more
immediate
importance
.
<EOS>
Read
my
notes
,
if
you
can
.
<EOS>
Familiarise
your
mind
with
what
has
happened
in
the
past
.
<EOS>
I
have
something
very
bold
and
very
startling
to
propose
to
you
,
which
relates
to
the
future
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Those
last
words
roused
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
looked
at
the
papers
,
in
the
order
in
which
Ezra
Jennings
had
placed
them
in
my
hands
.
<EOS>
The
paper
which
contained
the
smaller
quantity
of
writing
was
the
uppermost
of
the
two
.
<EOS>
On
this
,
the
disconnected
words
,
and
fragments
of
sentences
,
which
had
dropped
from
Mr.
Candy
in
his
delirium
,
appeared
as
follows
:
  
"
...
<EOS>

Franklin
Blake

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
,
the
first
of
the
two
sheets
of
paper
came
to
an
end
.
<EOS>
I
handed
it
back
to
Ezra
Jennings
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
what
you
heard
at
his
bedside
?
<EOS>
"
I
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
Literally
and
exactly
what
I
heard
,
"
he
answered
 
"
except
that
the
repetitions
are
not
transferred
here
from
my
short
-
hand
notes
.
<EOS>
He
reiterated
certain
words
and
phrases
a
dozen
times
over
,
fifty
times
over
,
just
as
he
attached
more
or
less
importance
to
the
idea
which
they
represented
.
<EOS>
The
repetitions
,
in
this
sense
,
were
of
some
assistance
to
me
in
putting
together
those
fragments
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
suppose
,
"
he
added
,
pointing
to
the
second
sheet
of
paper
,
"
that
I
claim
to
have
reproduced
the
expressions
which
Mr.
Candy
himself
would
have
used
if
he
had
been
capable
of
speaking
connectedly
.
<EOS>
I
only
say
that
I
have
penetrated
through
the
obstacle
of
the
disconnected
expression
,
to
the
thought
which
was
underlying
it
connectedly
all
the
time
.
<EOS>
Judge
for
yourself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
turned
to
the
second
sheet
of
paper
,
which
I
now
knew
to
be
the
key
to
the
first
.
  
<EOS>
Once
more
,
Mr.
Candy
's
wanderings
appeared
,
copied
in
black
ink
;
<EOS>
the
intervals
between
the
phrases
being
filled
up
by
Ezra
Jennings
in
red
ink
.
<EOS>
I
reproduce
the
result
here
,
in
one
plain
form
;
the
original
language
and
the
interpretation
of
it
coming
close
enough
together
in
these
pages
to
be
easily
compared
and
verified
.
  
<EOS>
"
...
<EOS>
Mr.
Franklin
Blake
is
clever
and
agreeable
,
but
he
wants
taking
down
a
peg
when
he
talks
of
medicine
.
<EOS>
He
confesses
that
he
has
been
suffering
from
want
of
sleep
at
night
.
<EOS>
I
tell
him
that
his
nerves
are
out
of
order
,
and
that
he
ought
to
take
medicine
.
<EOS>
He
tells
me
that
taking
medicine
and
groping
in
the
dark
mean
one
and
the
same
thing
.
<EOS>
This
before
all
the
company
at
the
dinner
-
table
.
<EOS>
I
say
to
him
,
you
are
groping
after
sleep
,
and
nothing
but
medicine
can
help
you
to
find
it
.
<EOS>
He
says
to
me
,
I
have
heard
of
the
blind
leading
the
blind
,
and
now
I
know
what
it
means
.
<EOS>
Witty
 
<EOS>
but
I
can
give
him
a
night
's
rest
in
spite
of
his
teeth
.
<EOS>
He
really
wants
sleep
;
and
Lady
Verinder
's
medicine
chest
is
at
my
disposal
.
<EOS>
Give
him
five
-
and
-
twenty
minims
of
laudanum
to
-
night
,
without
his
knowing
it
;
and
then
call
to
-
morrow
morning
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
Mr.
Blake
,
will
you
try
a
little
medicine
to
-
day
?
<EOS>
You
will
never
sleep
without
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
There
you
are
out
,
Mr.
Candy
:
I
have
had
an
excellent
night
's
rest
without
it
.
"
<EOS>
Then
,
come
down
on
him
with
the
truth
!
<EOS>
"
You
have
had
something
besides
an
excellent
night
's
rest
;
you
had
a
dose
of
laudanum
,
sir
,
before
you
went
to
bed
.
<EOS>
What
do
you
say
to
the
art
of
medicine
,
now
?
"
<EOS>
"
  
Admiration
of
the
ingenuity
which
had
woven
this
smooth
and
finished
texture
out
of
the
ravelled
skein
was
naturally
the
first
impression
that
I
felt
,
on
handing
the
manuscript
back
to
Ezra
Jennings
.
<EOS>
He
modestly
interrupted
the
first
few
words
in
which
my
sense
of
surprise
expressed
itself
,
by
asking
me
if
the
conclusion
which
he
had
drawn
from
his
notes
was
also
the
conclusion
at
which
my
own
mind
had
arrived
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
believe
as
I
believe
,
"
he
said
,
"
that
you
were
acting
under
the
influence
of
the
laudanum
in
doing
all
that
you
did
,
on
the
night
of
Miss
Verinder
's
birthday
,
in
Lady
Verinder
's
house
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
too
ignorant
of
the
influence
of
laudanum
to
have
an
opinion
of
my
own
,
"
I
answered
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
only
follow
your
opinion
,
and
feel
convinced
that
you
are
right
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
well
.
<EOS>
The
next
question
is
this
.
<EOS>
You
are
convinced
;
and
I
am
convinced
 
<EOS>
how
are
we
to
carry
our
conviction
to
the
minds
of
other
people
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
pointed
to
the
two
manuscripts
,
lying
on
the
table
between
us
.
<EOS>
Ezra
Jennings
shook
his
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
Useless
,
Mr.
Blake
!
<EOS>
Quite
useless
,
as
they
stand
now
for
three
unanswerable
reasons
.
<EOS>
In
the
first
place
,
those
notes
have
been
taken
under
circumstances
entirely
out
of
the
experience
of
the
mass
of
mankind
.
<EOS>
Against
them
,
to
begin
with
!
<EOS>
In
the
second
place
,
those
notes
represent
a
medical
and
metaphysical
theory
.
<EOS>
Against
them
,
once
more
!
<EOS>
In
the
third
place
,
those
notes
are
of
my
making
;
there
is
nothing
but
my
assertion
to
the
contrary
,
to
guarantee
that
they
are
not
fabrications
.
<EOS>
Remember
what
I
told
you
on
the
moor
 
and
ask
yourself
what
my
assertion
is
worth
.
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
my
notes
have
but
one
value
,
looking
to
the
verdict
of
the
world
outside
.
<EOS>
Your
innocence
is
to
be
vindicated
;
and
they
show
how
it
can
be
done
.
<EOS>
We
must
put
our
conviction
to
the
proof
 
<EOS>
and
You
are
the
man
to
prove
it
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
  
<EOS>
He
leaned
eagerly
nearer
to
me
across
the
table
that
divided
us
.
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
willing
to
try
a
bold
experiment
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
do
anything
to
clear
myself
of
the
suspicion
that
rests
on
me
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
submit
to
some
personal
inconvenience
for
a
time
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
To
any
inconvenience
,
no
matter
what
it
may
be
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Will
you
be
guided
implicitly
by
my
advice
?
<EOS>
It
may
expose
you
to
the
ridicule
of
fools
;
it
may
subject
you
to
the
remonstrances
of
friends
whose
opinions
you
are
bound
to
respect
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Tell
me
what
to
do
!
<EOS>
"
I
broke
out
impatiently
.
"
<EOS>
And
,
come
what
may
,
I
'll
do
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
shall
do
this
,
Mr.
Blake
,
"
he
answered
.
<EOS>
"
You
shall
steal
the
Diamond
,
unconsciously
,
for
the
second
time
,
in
the
presence
of
witnesses
whose
testimony
is
beyond
dispute
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
started
to
my
feet
.
<EOS>
I
tried
to
speak
.
<EOS>
I
could
only
look
at
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
it
CAN
be
done
,
"
he
went
on
.
"
<EOS>
And
it
shall
be
done
 
if
you
will
only
help
me
.
<EOS>
Try
to
compose
yourself
 
sit
down
,
and
hear
what
I
have
to
say
to
you
.
<EOS>
You
have
resumed
the
habit
of
smoking
;
I
have
seen
that
for
myself
.
<EOS>
How
long
have
you
resumed
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
For
nearly
a
year
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
you
smoke
more
or
less
than
you
did
?
"
  
"
More
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
give
up
the
habit
again
?
<EOS>
Suddenly
,
mind
!
 
<EOS>
as
you
gave
it
up
before
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
began
dimly
to
see
his
drift
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
give
it
up
,
from
this
moment
,
"
I
answered
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
the
same
consequences
follow
,
which
followed
last
June
,
"
said
Ezra
Jennings
 
<EOS>
"
if
you
suffer
once
more
as
you
suffered
then
,
from
sleepless
nights
,
we
shall
have
gained
our
first
step
.
<EOS>
We
shall
have
put
you
back
again
into
something
assimilating
to
your
nervous
condition
on
the
birthday
night
.
<EOS>
If
we
can
next
revive
,
or
nearly
revive
,
the
domestic
circumstances
which
surrounded
you
;
and
if
we
can
occupy
your
mind
again
with
the
various
questions
concerning
the
Diamond
which
formerly
agitated
it
,
we
shall
have
replaced
you
,
as
nearly
as
possible
in
the
same
position
,
physically
and
morally
,
in
which
the
opium
found
you
last
year
.
<EOS>
In
that
case
we
may
fairly
hope
that
a
repetition
of
the
dose
will
lead
,
in
a
greater
or
lesser
degree
,
to
a
repetition
of
the
result
.
<EOS>
There
is
my
proposal
,
expressed
in
a
few
hasty
words
.
<EOS>
You
shall
now
see
what
reasons
I
have
to
justify
me
in
making
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
turned
to
one
of
the
books
at
his
side
,
and
opened
it
at
a
place
marked
by
a
small
slip
of
paper
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
suppose
that
I
am
going
to
weary
you
with
a
lecture
on
physiology
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
myself
bound
to
prove
,
in
justice
to
both
of
us
,
that
I
am
not
asking
you
to
try
this
experiment
in
deference
to
any
theory
of
my
own
devising
.
<EOS>
Admitted
principles
,
and
recognised
authorities
,
justify
me
in
the
view
that
I
take
.
<EOS>
Give
me
five
minutes
of
your
attention
;
and
I
will
undertake
to
show
you
that
Science
sanctions
my
proposal
,
fanciful
as
it
may
seem
.
<EOS>
Here
,
in
the
first
place
,
is
the
physiological
principle
on
which
I
am
acting
,
stated
by
no
less
a
person
than
Dr.
Carpenter
.
<EOS>
Read
it
for
yourself
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
handed
me
the
slip
of
paper
which
had
marked
the
place
in
the
book
.
<EOS>
It
contained
a
few
lines
of
writing
,
as
follows
:
    
"
There
seems
much
ground
for
the
belief
,
that
every
sensory
impression
which
has
once
been
recognised
by
the
perceptive
consciousness
,
is
registered
(
so
to
speak
)
in
the
brain
,
and
may
be
reproduced
at
some
subsequent
time
,
although
there
may
be
no
consciousness
of
its
existence
in
the
mind
during
the
whole
intermediate
period
.
"
<EOS>
"
Is
that
plain
,
so
far
?
"
asked
Ezra
Jennings
.
  
<EOS>
"
Perfectly
plain
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
pushed
the
open
book
across
the
table
to
me
,
and
pointed
to
a
passage
,
marked
by
pencil
lines
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
"
he
said
,
"
read
that
account
of
a
case
,
which
has
 
as
I
believe
 
a
direct
bearing
on
your
own
position
,
and
on
the
experiment
which
I
am
tempting
you
to
try
.
<EOS>
Observe
,
Mr.
Blake
,
before
you
begin
,
that
I
am
now
referring
you
to
one
of
the
greatest
of
English
physiologists
.
<EOS>
The
book
in
your
hand
is
Doctor
Elliotson
's
HUMAN
PHYSIOLOGY
;
and
the
case
which
the
doctor
cites
rests
on
the
well
-
known
authority
of
Mr.
Combe
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
passage
pointed
out
to
me
was
expressed
in
these
terms
:
    
"
Dr.
Abel
informed
me
,
"
says
Mr.
Combe
,
"
of
an
Irish
porter
to
a
warehouse
,
who
forgot
,
when
sober
,
what
he
had
done
when
drunk
;
but
,
being
drunk
,
again
recollected
the
transactions
of
his
former
state
of
intoxication
.
<EOS>
On
one
occasion
,
being
drunk
,
he
had
lost
a
parcel
of
some
value
,
and
in
his
sober
moments
could
give
no
account
of
it
.
<EOS>
Next
time
he
was
intoxicated
,
he
recollected
that
he
had
left
the
parcel
at
a
certain
house
,
and
there
being
no
address
on
it
,
it
had
remained
there
safely
,
and
was
got
on
his
calling
for
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Plain
again
?
"
asked
Ezra
Jennings
.
  
<EOS>
"
As
plain
as
need
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
put
back
the
slip
of
paper
in
its
place
,
and
closed
the
book
.
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
satisfied
that
I
have
not
spoken
without
good
authority
to
support
me
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
.
<EOS>
"
If
not
,
I
have
only
to
go
to
those
bookshelves
,
and
you
have
only
to
read
the
passages
which
I
can
point
out
to
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
quite
satisfied
,
"
I
said
,
"
without
reading
a
word
more
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
In
that
case
,
we
may
return
to
your
own
personal
interest
in
this
matter
.
<EOS>
I
am
bound
to
tell
you
that
there
is
something
to
be
said
against
the
experiment
as
well
as
for
it
.
<EOS>
If
we
could
,
this
year
,
exactly
reproduce
,
in
your
case
,
the
conditions
as
they
existed
last
year
,
it
is
physiologically
certain
that
we
should
arrive
at
exactly
the
same
result
.
<EOS>
But
this
 
there
is
no
denying
it
 
is
simply
impossible
.
<EOS>
We
can
only
hope
to
approximate
to
the
conditions
;
and
if
we
do
n't
succeed
in
getting
you
nearly
enough
back
to
what
you
were
,
this
venture
of
ours
will
fail
.
<EOS>
If
we
do
succeed
 
and
I
am
myself
hopeful
of
success
 
<EOS>
you
may
at
least
so
far
repeat
your
proceedings
on
the
birthday
night
,
as
to
satisfy
any
reasonable
person
that
you
are
guiltless
,
morally
speaking
,
of
the
theft
of
the
Diamond
.
<EOS>
I
believe
,
Mr.
Blake
,
I
have
now
stated
the
question
,
on
both
sides
of
it
,
as
fairly
as
I
can
,
within
the
limits
that
I
have
imposed
on
myself
.
<EOS>
If
there
is
anything
that
I
have
not
made
clear
to
you
,
tell
me
what
it
is
 
<EOS>
and
if
I
can
enlighten
you
,
I
will
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
All
that
you
have
explained
to
me
,
"
I
said
,
"
I
understand
perfectly
.
<EOS>
But
I
own
I
am
puzzled
on
one
point
,
which
you
have
not
made
clear
to
me
yet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
the
point
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
understand
the
effect
of
the
laudanum
on
me
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
understand
my
walking
down
-
stairs
,
and
along
corridors
,
and
my
opening
and
shutting
the
drawers
of
a
cabinet
,
and
my
going
back
again
to
my
own
room
.
<EOS>
All
these
are
active
proceedings
.
<EOS>
I
thought
the
influence
of
opium
was
first
to
stupefy
you
,
and
then
to
send
you
to
sleep
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
common
error
about
opium
,
Mr.
Blake
!
<EOS>
I
am
,
at
this
moment
,
exerting
my
intelligence
(
such
as
it
is
)
in
your
service
,
under
the
influence
of
a
dose
of
laudanum
,
some
ten
times
larger
than
the
dose
Mr.
Candy
administered
to
you
.
<EOS>
But
do
n't
trust
to
my
authority
 
even
on
a
question
which
comes
within
my
own
personal
experience
.
<EOS>
I
anticipated
the
objection
you
have
just
made
:
and
I
have
again
provided
myself
with
independent
testimony
which
will
carry
its
due
weight
with
it
in
your
own
mind
,
and
in
the
minds
of
your
friends
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
handed
me
the
second
of
the
two
books
which
he
had
by
him
on
the
table
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
,
"
he
said
,
"
are
the
far
-
famed
CONFESSIONS
OF
AN
ENGLISH
OPIUM
EATER
!
<EOS>
Take
the
book
away
with
you
,
and
read
it
.
<EOS>
At
the
passage
which
I
have
marked
,
you
will
find
that
when
De
Quincey
had
committed
what
he
calls
"
a
debauch
of
opium
,
"
he
either
went
to
the
gallery
at
the
Opera
to
enjoy
the
music
,
or
he
wandered
about
the
London
markets
on
Saturday
night
,
and
interested
himself
in
observing
all
the
little
shifts
and
bargainings
of
the
poor
in
providing
their
Sunday
's
dinner
.
<EOS>
So
much
for
the
capacity
of
a
man
to
occupy
himself
actively
,
and
to
move
about
from
place
to
place
under
the
influence
of
opium
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
answered
so
far
,
"
I
said
;
"
but
I
am
not
answered
yet
as
to
the
effect
produced
by
the
opium
on
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
try
to
answer
you
in
a
few
words
,
"
said
Ezra
Jennings
.
<EOS>
"
The
action
of
opium
is
comprised
,
in
the
majority
of
cases
,
in
two
influences
 
a
stimulating
influence
first
,
and
a
sedative
influence
afterwards
.
<EOS>
Under
the
stimulating
influence
,
the
latest
and
most
vivid
impressions
left
on
your
mind
 
namely
,
the
impressions
relating
to
the
Diamond
 
would
be
likely
,
in
your
morbidly
sensitive
nervous
condition
,
to
become
intensified
in
your
brain
,
and
would
subordinate
to
themselves
your
judgment
and
your
will
exactly
as
an
ordinary
dream
subordinates
to
itself
<EOS>
your
judgment
and
your
will
.
<EOS>
Little
by
little
,
under
this
action
,
any
apprehensions
about
the
safety
of
the
Diamond
which
you
might
have
felt
during
the
day
would
be
liable
to
develop
themselves
from
the
state
of
doubt
to
the
state
of
certainty
 
would
impel
you
into
practical
action
to
preserve
the
jewel
 
would
direct
your
steps
,
with
that
motive
in
view
,
into
the
room
which
you
entered
 
and
would
guide
your
hand
to
the
drawers
of
the
cabinet
,
until
you
had
found
the
drawer
which
held
the
stone
.
<EOS>
In
the
spiritualised
intoxication
of
opium
,
you
would
do
all
that
.
<EOS>
Later
,
as
the
sedative
action
began
to
gain
on
the
stimulant
action
,
you
would
slowly
become
inert
and
stupefied
.
<EOS>
Later
still
you
would
fall
into
a
deep
sleep
.
<EOS>
When
the
morning
came
,
and
the
effect
of
the
opium
had
been
all
slept
off
,
you
would
wake
as
absolutely
ignorant
of
what
you
had
done
in
the
night
as
if
you
had
been
living
at
the
Antipodes
.
<EOS>
Have
I
made
it
tolerably
clear
to
you
so
far
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
made
it
so
clear
,
"
I
said
,
"
that
I
want
you
to
go
farther
.
<EOS>
You
have
shown
me
how
I
entered
the
room
,
and
how
I
came
to
take
the
Diamond
.
<EOS>
But
Miss
Verinder
saw
me
leave
the
room
again
,
with
the
jewel
in
my
hand
.
<EOS>
Can
you
trace
my
proceedings
from
that
moment
?
<EOS>
Can
you
guess
what
I
did
next
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
the
very
point
I
was
coming
to
,
"
he
rejoined
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
question
with
me
whether
the
experiment
which
I
propose
as
a
means
of
vindicating
your
innocence
,
may
not
also
be
made
a
means
of
recovering
the
lost
Diamond
as
well
.
<EOS>
When
you
left
Miss
Verinder
's
sitting
-
room
,
with
the
jewel
in
your
hand
,
you
went
back
in
all
probability
to
your
own
room
 
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
?
<EOS>
and
what
then
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
possible
,
Mr.
Blake
 
<EOS>
I
dare
not
say
more
 
that
your
idea
of
preserving
the
Diamond
led
,
by
a
natural
sequence
,
to
the
idea
of
hiding
the
Diamond
,
and
that
the
place
in
which
you
hid
it
was
somewhere
in
your
bedroom
.
<EOS>
In
that
event
,
the
case
of
the
Irish
porter
may
be
your
case
.
<EOS>
You
may
remember
,
under
the
influence
of
the
second
dose
of
opium
,
the
place
in
which
you
hid
the
Diamond
under
the
influence
of
the
first
.
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
my
turn
,
now
,
to
enlighten
Ezra
Jennings
.
<EOS>
I
stopped
him
,
before
he
could
say
any
more
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
speculating
,
"
I
said
,
"
on
a
result
which
can
not
possibly
take
place
.
<EOS>
The
Diamond
is
,
at
this
moment
,
in
London
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
started
,
and
looked
at
me
in
great
surprise
.
  
<EOS>
"
In
London
?
"
he
repeated
.
<EOS>
"
How
did
it
get
to
London
from
Lady
Verinder
's
house
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nobody
knows
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
removed
it
with
your
own
hand
from
Miss
Verinder
's
room
.
<EOS>
How
was
it
taken
out
of
your
keeping
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
idea
how
it
was
taken
out
of
my
keeping
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
you
see
it
,
when
you
woke
in
the
morning
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
.
"
  
"
Has
Miss
Verinder
recovered
possession
of
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Blake
!
<EOS>
there
seems
to
be
something
here
which
wants
clearing
up
.
<EOS>
May
I
ask
how
you
know
that
the
Diamond
is
,
at
this
moment
,
in
London
?
"
  
<EOS>
I
had
put
precisely
the
same
question
to
Mr.
Bruff
when
I
made
my
first
inquiries
about
the
Moonstone
,
on
my
return
to
England
.
<EOS>
In
answering
Ezra
Jennings
,
I
accordingly
repeated
what
I
had
myself
heard
from
the
lawyer
's
own
lips
 
and
what
is
already
familiar
to
the
readers
of
these
pages
.
  
<EOS>
He
showed
plainly
that
he
was
not
satisfied
with
my
reply
.
  
<EOS>
"
With
all
deference
to
you
,
"
he
said
,
"
and
with
all
deference
to
your
legal
adviser
,
I
maintain
the
opinion
which
I
expressed
just
now
.
<EOS>
It
rests
,
I
am
well
aware
,
on
a
mere
assumption
.
<EOS>
Pardon
me
for
reminding
you
,
that
your
opinion
also
rests
on
a
mere
assumption
as
well
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
view
he
took
of
the
matter
was
entirely
new
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
waited
anxiously
to
hear
how
he
would
defend
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
assume
,
"
pursued
Ezra
Jennings
,
"
that
the
influence
of
the
opium
 
after
impelling
you
to
possess
yourself
of
the
Diamond
,
with
the
purpose
of
securing
its
safety
 
might
also
impel
you
,
acting
under
the
same
influence
and
the
same
motive
,
to
hide
it
somewhere
in
your
own
room
.
<EOS>
YOU
assume
that
the
Hindoo
conspirators
could
by
no
possibility
commit
a
mistake
.
<EOS>
The
Indians
went
to
Mr.
Luker
's
house
after
the
Diamond
 
and
,
therefore
,
in
Mr.
Luker
's
possession
the
Diamond
must
be
!
<EOS>
Have
you
any
evidence
to
prove
that
the
Moonstone
was
taken
to
London
at
all
?
<EOS>
You
ca
n't
even
guess
how
,
or
by
whom
,
it
was
removed
from
Lady
Verinder
's
house
!
<EOS>
Have
you
any
evidence
that
the
jewel
was
pledged
to
Mr.
Luker
?
<EOS>
He
declares
that
he
never
heard
of
the
Moonstone
;
and
his
bankers
'
receipt
acknowledges
nothing
but
the
deposit
of
a
valuable
of
great
price
.
<EOS>
The
Indians
assume
that
Mr.
Luker
is
lying
 
and
you
assume
again
that
the
Indians
are
right
.
<EOS>
All
I
say
,
in
differing
with
you
,
is
 
that
my
view
is
possible
.
<EOS>
What
more
,
Mr.
Blake
,
either
logically
,
or
legally
,
can
be
said
for
yours
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
put
strongly
;
but
there
was
no
denying
that
it
was
put
truly
as
well
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
confess
you
stagger
me
,
"
I
replied
.
<EOS>
"
Do
you
object
to
my
writing
to
Mr.
Bruff
,
and
telling
him
what
you
have
said
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
On
the
contrary
,
I
shall
be
glad
if
you
will
write
to
Mr.
Bruff
.
<EOS>
If
we
consult
his
experience
,
we
may
see
the
matter
under
a
new
light
.
<EOS>
For
the
present
,
let
us
return
to
our
experiment
with
the
opium
.
<EOS>
We
have
decided
that
you
leave
off
the
habit
of
smoking
from
this
moment
.
"
  
"
From
this
moment
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
the
first
step
.
<EOS>
The
next
step
is
to
reproduce
,
as
nearly
as
we
can
,
the
domestic
circumstances
which
surrounded
you
last
year
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
How
was
this
to
be
done
?
<EOS>
Lady
Verinder
was
dead
.
<EOS>
Rachel
and
I
,
so
long
as
the
suspicion
of
theft
rested
on
me
,
were
parted
irrevocably
.
<EOS>
Godfrey
Ablewhite
was
away
travelling
on
the
Continent
.
<EOS>
It
was
simply
impossible
to
reassemble
the
people
who
had
inhabited
the
house
,
when
I
had
slept
in
it
last
.
<EOS>
The
statement
of
this
objection
did
not
appear
to
embarrass
Ezra
Jennings
.
<EOS>
He
attached
very
little
importance
,
he
said
,
to
reassembling
the
same
people
 
seeing
that
it
would
be
vain
to
expect
them
to
reassume
the
various
positions
which
they
had
occupied
towards
me
in
the
past
times
.
<EOS>
On
the
other
hand
,
he
considered
it
essential
to
the
success
of
the
experiment
,
that
I
should
see
the
same
objects
about
me
which
had
surrounded
me
when
I
was
last
in
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
"
Above
all
things
,
"
he
said
,
"
you
must
sleep
in
the
room
which
you
slept
in
,
on
the
birthday
night
,
and
it
must
be
furnished
in
the
same
way
.
<EOS>
The
stairs
,
the
corridors
,
and
Miss
Verinder
's
sitting
-
room
,
must
also
be
restored
to
what
they
were
when
you
saw
them
last
.
<EOS>
It
is
absolutely
necessary
,
Mr.
Blake
,
to
replace
every
article
of
furniture
in
that
part
of
the
house
which
may
now
be
put
away
.
<EOS>
The
sacrifice
of
your
cigars
will
be
useless
,
unless
we
can
get
Miss
Verinder
's
permission
to
do
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Who
is
to
apply
to
her
for
permission
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
it
not
possible
for
you
to
apply
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Quite
out
of
the
question
.
<EOS>
After
what
has
passed
between
us
on
the
subject
of
the
lost
Diamond
,
I
can
neither
see
her
,
nor
write
to
her
,
as
things
are
now
.
"
  
<EOS>
Ezra
Jennings
paused
,
and
considered
for
a
moment
.
  
<EOS>
"
May
I
ask
you
a
delicate
question
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
.
  
<EOS>
I
signed
to
him
to
go
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
Am
I
right
,
Mr.
Blake
,
in
fancying
(
from
one
or
two
things
which
have
dropped
from
you
)
that
you
felt
no
common
interest
in
Miss
Verinder
,
in
former
times
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Quite
right
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Was
the
feeling
returned
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
think
Miss
Verinder
would
be
likely
to
feel
a
strong
interest
in
the
attempt
to
prove
your
innocence
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
certain
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
In
that
case
,
I
will
write
to
Miss
Verinder
 
if
you
will
give
me
leave
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Telling
her
of
the
proposal
that
you
have
made
to
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Telling
her
of
everything
that
has
passed
between
us
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
is
needless
to
say
that
I
eagerly
accepted
the
service
which
he
had
offered
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
have
time
to
write
by
to
-
day
's
post
,
"
he
said
,
looking
at
his
watch
.
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
forget
to
lock
up
your
cigars
,
when
you
get
back
to
the
hotel
!
<EOS>
I
will
call
to
-
morrow
morning
and
hear
how
you
have
passed
the
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
rose
to
take
leave
of
him
;
and
attempted
to
express
the
grateful
sense
of
his
kindness
which
I
really
felt
.
  
<EOS>
He
pressed
my
hand
gently
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Remember
what
I
told
you
on
the
moor
,
"
he
answered
.
<EOS>
"
If
I
can
do
you
this
little
service
,
Mr.
Blake
,
I
shall
feel
it
like
a
last
gleam
of
sunshine
,
falling
on
the
evening
of
a
long
and
clouded
day

We
parted

was

<EOS>
With
some
interruption
from
patients
,
and
some
interruption
from
pain
,
I
finished
my
letter
to
Miss
Verinder
in
time
for
to
-
day
's
post
.
<EOS>
I
failed
to
make
it
as
short
a
letter
as
I
could
have
wished
.
<EOS>
But
I
think
I
have
made
it
plain
.
<EOS>
It
leaves
her
entirely
mistress
of
her
own
decision
.
<EOS>
If
she
consents
to
assist
the
experiment
,
she
consents
of
her
own
free
will
,
and
not
as
a
favour
to
Mr.
Franklin
Blake
or
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
June
16th
.
 
<EOS>
Rose
late
,
after
a
dreadful
night
;
the
vengeance
of
yesterday
's
opium
,
pursuing
me
through
a
series
of
frightful
dreams
.
<EOS>
At
one
time
I
was
whirling
through
empty
space
with
the
phantoms
of
the
dead
,
friends
and
enemies
together
.
<EOS>
At
another
,
the
one
beloved
face
which
I
shall
never
see
again
,
rose
at
my
bedside
,
hideously
phosphorescent
in
the
black
darkness
,
and
glared
and
grinned
at
me
.
<EOS>
A
slight
return
of
the
old
pain
,
at
the
usual
time
in
the
early
morning
,
was
welcome
as
a
change
.
<EOS>
It
dispelled
the
visions
 
and
it
was
bearable
because
it
did
that
.
  
<EOS>
My
bad
night
made
it
late
in
the
morning
,
before
I
could
get
to
Mr.
Franklin
Blake
.
<EOS>
I
found
him
stretched
on
the
sofa
,
breakfasting
on
brandy
and
soda
-
water
,
and
a
dry
biscuit
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
beginning
,
as
well
as
you
could
possibly
wish
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
A
miserable
,
restless
night
;
and
a
total
failure
of
appetite
this
morning
.
<EOS>
Exactly
what
happened
last
year
,
when
I
gave
up
my
cigars
.
<EOS>
The
sooner
I
am
ready
for
my
second
dose
of
laudanum
,
the
better
I
shall
be
pleased
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
shall
have
it
on
the
earliest
possible
day
,
"
I
answered
.
<EOS>
"
In
the
meantime
,
we
must
be
as
careful
of
your
health
as
we
can
.
<EOS>
If
we
allow
you
to
become
exhausted
,
we
shall
fail
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
You
must
get
an
appetite
for
your
dinner
.
<EOS>
In
other
words
,
you
must
get
a
ride
or
a
walk
this
morning
,
in
the
fresh
air
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
ride
,
if
they
can
find
me
a
horse
here
.
<EOS>
By
-
the
-
by
,
I
wrote
to
Mr.
Bruff
,
yesterday
.
<EOS>
Have
you
written
to
Miss
Verinder
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
 
by
last
night
's
post
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
good
.
<EOS>
We
shall
have
some
news
worth
hearing
,
to
tell
each
other
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
go
yet
!
<EOS>
I
have
a
word
to
say
to
you
.
<EOS>
You
appeared
to
think
,
yesterday
,
that
our
experiment
with
the
opium
was
not
likely
to
be
viewed
very
favourably
by
some
of
my
friends
.
<EOS>
You
were
quite
right
.
<EOS>
I
call
old
Gabriel
Betteredge
one
of
my
friends
;
and
you
will
be
amused
to
hear
that
he
protested
strongly
when
I
saw
him
yesterday
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
done
a
wonderful
number
of
foolish
things
in
the
course
of
your
life
,
Mr.
Franklin
,
but
this
tops
them
all
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
There
is
Betteredge
's
opinion
!
<EOS>
You
will
make
allowance
for
his
prejudices
,
I
am
sure
,
if
you
and
he
happen
to
meet
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
left
Mr.
Blake
,
to
go
my
rounds
among
my
patients
;
feeling
the
better
and
the
happier
even
for
the
short
interview
that
I
had
had
with
him
.
  
<EOS>
What
is
the
secret
of
the
attraction
that
there
is
for
me
in
this
man
?
<EOS>
Does
it
only
mean
that
I
feel
the
contrast
between
the
frankly
kind
manner
in
which
he
has
allowed
me
to
become
acquainted
with
him
,
and
the
merciless
dislike
and
distrust
with
which
I
am
met
by
other
people
?
<EOS>
Or
is
there
really
something
in
him
which
answers
to
the
yearning
that
I
have
for
a
little
human
sympathy
 
<EOS>
the
yearning
,
which
has
survived
the
solitude
and
persecution
of
many
years
;
which
seems
to
grow
keener
and
keener
,
as
the
time
comes
nearer
and
nearer
when
I
shall
endure
and
feel
no
more
?
<EOS>
How
useless
to
ask
these
questions
!
<EOS>
Mr.
Blake
has
given
me
a
new
interest
in
life
.
<EOS>
Let
that
be
enough
,
without
seeking
to
know
what
the
new
interest
is
.
  
<EOS>
June
17th
.
 
<EOS>
Before
breakfast
,
this
morning
,
Mr.
Candy
informed
me
that
he
was
going
away
for
a
fortnight
,
on
a
visit
to
a
friend
in
the
south
of
England
.
<EOS>
He
gave
me
as
many
special
directions
,
poor
fellow
,
about
the
patients
,
as
if
he
still
had
the
large
practice
which
he
possessed
before
he
was
taken
ill
.
<EOS>
The
practice
is
worth
little
enough
now
!
<EOS>
Other
doctors
have
superseded
HIM
;
and
nobody
who
can
help
it
will
employ
me
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
perhaps
fortunate
that
he
is
to
be
away
just
at
this
time
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
been
mortified
if
I
had
not
informed
him
of
the
experiment
which
I
am
going
to
try
with
Mr.
Blake
.
<EOS>
And
I
hardly
know
what
undesirable
results
might
not
have
happened
,
if
I
had
taken
him
into
my
confidence
.
<EOS>
Better
as
it
is
.
<EOS>
Unquestionably
,
better
as
it
is
.
  
<EOS>
The
post
brought
me
Miss
Verinder
's
answer
,
after
Mr.
Candy
had
left
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
A
charming
letter
!
<EOS>
It
gives
me
the
highest
opinion
of
her
.
<EOS>
There
is
no
attempt
to
conceal
the
interest
that
she
feels
in
our
proceedings
.
<EOS>
She
tells
me
,
in
the
prettiest
manner
,
that
my
letter
has
satisfied
her
of
Mr.
Blake
's
innocence
,
without
the
slightest
need
(
so
far
as
she
is
concerned
)
of
putting
my
assertion
to
the
proof
.
<EOS>
She
even
upbraids
herself
 
most
undeservedly
,
poor
thing
!
 
<EOS>
for
not
having
divined
at
the
time
what
the
true
solution
of
the
mystery
might
really
be
.
<EOS>
The
motive
underlying
all
this
proceeds
evidently
from
something
more
than
a
generous
eagerness
to
make
atonement
for
a
wrong
which
she
has
innocently
inflicted
on
another
person
.
<EOS>
It
is
plain
that
she
has
loved
him
,
throughout
the
estrangement
between
them
.
<EOS>
In
more
than
one
place
the
rapture
of
discovering
that
he
has
deserved
to
be
loved
,
breaks
its
way
innocently
through
the
stoutest
formalities
of
pen
and
ink
,
and
even
defies
the
stronger
restraint
still
of
writing
to
a
stranger
.
<EOS>
Is
it
possible
(
I
ask
myself
,
in
reading
this
delightful
letter
)
that
I
,
of
all
men
in
the
world
,
am
chosen
to
be
the
means
of
bringing
these
two
young
people
together
again
?
<EOS>
My
own
happiness
has
been
trampled
under
foot
;
my
own
love
has
been
torn
from
me
.
<EOS>
Shall
I
live
to
see
a
happiness
of
others
,
which
is
of
my
making
 
a
love
renewed
,
which
is
of
my
bringing
back
?
<EOS>
Oh
merciful
Death
,
let
me
see
it
before
your
arms
enfold
me
,
before
your
voice
whispers
to
me
,
"
Rest
at
last
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
are
two
requests
contained
in
the
letter
.
<EOS>
One
of
them
prevents
me
from
showing
it
to
Mr.
Franklin
Blake
.
<EOS>
I
am
authorised
to
tell
him
that
Miss
Verinder
willingly
consents
to
place
her
house
at
our
disposal
;
and
,
that
said
,
I
am
desired
to
add
no
more
.
  
<EOS>
So
far
,
it
is
easy
to
comply
with
her
wishes
.
<EOS>
But
the
second
request
embarrasses
me
seriously
.
  
<EOS>
Not
content
with
having
written
to
Mr.
Betteredge
,
instructing
him
to
carry
out
whatever
directions
I
may
have
to
give
,
Miss
Verinder
asks
leave
to
assist
me
,
by
personally
superintending
the
restoration
of
her
own
sitting
-
room
.
<EOS>
She
only
waits
a
word
of
reply
from
me
to
make
the
journey
to
Yorkshire
,
and
to
be
present
as
one
of
the
witnesses
on
the
night
when
the
opium
is
tried
for
the
second
time
.
  
<EOS>
Here
,
again
,
there
is
a
motive
under
the
surface
;
and
,
here
again
,
I
fancy
that
I
can
find
it
out
.
  
<EOS>
What
she
has
forbidden
me
to
tell
Mr.
Franklin
Blake
,
she
is
(
as
I
interpret
it
)
eager
to
tell
him
with
her
own
lips
,
BEFORE
he
is
put
to
the
test
which
is
to
vindicate
his
character
in
the
eyes
of
other
people
.
<EOS>
I
understand
and
admire
this
generous
anxiety
to
acquit
him
,
without
waiting
until
his
innocence
may
,
or
may
not
,
be
proved
.
<EOS>
It
is
the
atonement
that
she
is
longing
to
make
,
poor
girl
,
after
having
innocently
and
inevitably
wronged
him
.
<EOS>
But
the
thing
can
not
be
done
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
sort
of
doubt
that
the
agitation
which
a
meeting
between
them
would
produce
on
both
sides
 
reviving
dormant
feelings
,
appealing
to
old
memories
,
awakening
new
hopes
 
would
,
in
their
effect
on
the
mind
of
Mr.
Blake
,
be
almost
certainly
fatal
to
the
success
of
our
experiment
.
<EOS>
It
is
hard
enough
,
as
things
are
,
to
reproduce
in
him
the
conditions
as
they
existed
,
or
nearly
as
they
existed
,
last
year
.
<EOS>
With
new
interests
and
new
emotions
to
agitate
him
,
the
attempt
would
be
simply
useless
.
  
<EOS>
And
yet
,
knowing
this
,
I
can
not
find
it
in
my
heart
to
disappoint
her
.
<EOS>
I
must
try
if
I
can
discover
some
new
arrangement
,
before
post
-
time
,
which
will
allow
me
to
say
Yes
to
Miss
Verinder
,
without
damage
to
the
service
which
I
have
bound
myself
to
render
to
Mr.
Franklin
Blake
.
  
<EOS>
Two
o'clock
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
just
returned
from
my
round
of
medical
visits
;
having
begun
,
of
course
,
by
calling
at
the
hotel
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Blake
's
report
of
the
night
is
the
same
as
before
.
<EOS>
He
has
had
some
intervals
of
broken
sleep
,
and
no
more
.
<EOS>
But
he
feels
it
less
to
-
day
,
having
slept
after
yesterday
's
dinner
.
<EOS>
This
after
-
dinner
sleep
is
the
result
,
no
doubt
,
of
the
ride
which
I
advised
him
to
take
.
<EOS>
I
fear
I
shall
have
to
curtail
his
restorative
exercise
in
the
fresh
air
.
<EOS>
He
must
not
be
too
well
;
he
must
not
be
too
ill
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
case
(
as
a
sailor
would
say
)
of
very
fine
steering
.
  
<EOS>
He
has
not
heard
yet
from
Mr.
Bruff
.
<EOS>
I
found
him
eager
to
know
if
I
had
received
any
answer
from
Miss
Verinder
.
  
<EOS>
I
told
him
exactly
what
I
was
permitted
to
tell
,
and
no
more
.
<EOS>
It
was
quite
needless
to
invent
excuses
for
not
showing
him
the
letter
.
<EOS>
He
told
me
bitterly
enough
,
poor
fellow
,
that
he
understood
the
delicacy
which
disinclined
me
to
produce
it
.
"
<EOS>
She
consents
,
of
course
,
as
a
matter
of
common
courtesy
and
common
justice
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
But
she
keeps
her
own
opinion
of
me
,
and
waits
to
see
the
result
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
sorely
tempted
to
hint
that
he
was
now
wronging
her
as
she
had
wronged
him
.
<EOS>
On
reflection
,
I
shrank
from
forestalling
her
in
the
double
luxury
of
surprising
and
forgiving
him
.
  
<EOS>
My
visit
was
a
very
short
one
.
<EOS>
After
the
experience
of
the
other
night
,
I
have
been
compelled
once
more
to
give
up
my
dose
of
opium
.
<EOS>
As
a
necessary
result
,
the
agony
of
the
disease
that
is
in
me
has
got
the
upper
hand
again
.
<EOS>
I
felt
the
attack
coming
on
,
and
left
abruptly
,
so
as
not
to
alarm
or
distress
him
.
<EOS>
It
only
lasted
a
quarter
of
an
hour
this
time
,
and
it
left
me
strength
enough
to
go
on
with
my
work
.
  
<EOS>
Five
o'clock
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
written
my
reply
to
Miss
Verinder
.
  
<EOS>
The
arrangement
I
have
proposed
reconciles
the
interests
on
both
sides
,
if
she
will
only
consent
to
it
.
<EOS>
After
first
stating
the
objections
that
there
are
to
a
meeting
between
Mr.
Blake
and
herself
,
before
the
experiment
is
tried
,
I
have
suggested
that
she
should
so
time
her
journey
as
to
arrive
at
the
house
privately
,
on
the
evening
when
we
make
the
attempt
.
<EOS>
Travelling
by
the
afternoon
train
from
London
,
she
would
delay
her
arrival
until
nine
o'clock
.
<EOS>
At
that
hour
,
I
have
undertaken
to
see
Mr.
Blake
safely
into
his
bedchamber
;
and
so
to
leave
Miss
Verinder
free
to
occupy
her
own
rooms
until
the
time
comes
for
administering
the
laudanum
.
<EOS>
When
that
has
been
done
,
there
can
be
no
objection
to
her
watching
the
result
,
with
the
rest
of
us
.
<EOS>
On
the
next
morning
,
she
shall
show
Mr.
Blake
(
if
she
likes
)
her
correspondence
with
me
,
and
shall
satisfy
him
in
that
way
that
he
was
acquitted
in
her
estimation
,
before
the
question
of
his
innocence
was
put
to
the
proof
.
  
<EOS>
In
that
sense
,
I
have
written
to
her
.
<EOS>
This
is
all
that
I
can
do
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
To
-
morrow
I
must
see
Mr.
Betteredge
,
and
give
the
necessary
directions
for
reopening
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
June
18th
.
 
<EOS>
Late
again
,
in
calling
on
Mr.
Franklin
Blake
.
<EOS>
More
of
that
horrible
pain
in
the
early
morning
;
followed
,
this
time
,
by
complete
prostration
,
for
some
hours
.
<EOS>
I
foresee
,
in
spite
of
the
penalties
which
it
exacts
from
me
,
that
I
shall
have
to
return
to
the
opium
for
the
hundredth
time
.
<EOS>
If
I
had
only
myself
to
think
of
,
I
should
prefer
the
sharp
pains
to
the
frightful
dreams
.
<EOS>
But
the
physical
suffering
exhausts
me
.
<EOS>
If
I
let
myself
sink
,
it
may
end
in
my
becoming
useless
to
Mr.
Blake
at
the
time
when
he
wants
me
most
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
nearly
one
o'clock
before
I
could
get
to
the
hotel
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
The
visit
,
even
in
my
shattered
condition
,
proved
to
be
a
most
amusing
one
 
thanks
entirely
to
the
presence
on
the
scene
of
Gabriel
Betteredge
.
  
<EOS>
I
found
him
in
the
room
,
when
I
went
in
.
<EOS>
He
withdrew
to
the
window
and
looked
out
,
while
I
put
my
first
customary
question
to
my
patient
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Blake
had
slept
badly
again
,
and
he
felt
the
loss
of
rest
this
morning
more
than
he
had
felt
it
yet
.
  
<EOS>
I
asked
next
if
he
had
heard
from
Mr.
Bruff
.
  
<EOS>
A
letter
had
reached
him
that
morning
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bruff
expressed
the
strongest
disapproval
of
the
course
which
his
friend
and
client
was
taking
under
my
advice
.
<EOS>
It
was
mischievous
 
for
it
excited
hopes
that
might
never
be
realised
.
<EOS>
It
was
quite
unintelligible
to
HIS
mind
,
except
that
it
looked
like
a
piece
of
trickery
,
akin
to
the
trickery
of
mesmerism
,
clairvoyance
,
and
the
like
.
<EOS>
It
unsettled
Miss
Verinder
's
house
,
and
it
would
end
in
unsettling
Miss
Verinder
herself
.
<EOS>
He
had
put
the
case
(
without
mentioning
names
)
to
an
eminent
physician
;
and
the
eminent
physician
had
smiled
,
had
shaken
his
head
,
and
had
said
 
nothing
.
<EOS>
On
these
grounds
,
Mr.
Bruff
entered
his
protest
,
and
left
it
there
.
  
<EOS>
My
next
inquiry
related
to
the
subject
of
the
Diamond
.
<EOS>
Had
the
lawyer
produced
any
evidence
to
prove
that
the
jewel
was
in
London
?
  
<EOS>
No
,
the
lawyer
had
simply
declined
to
discuss
the
question
.
<EOS>
He
was
himself
satisfied
that
the
Moonstone
had
been
pledged
to
Mr.
Luker
.
<EOS>
His
eminent
absent
friend
,
Mr.
Murthwaite
(
whose
consummate
knowledge
of
the
Indian
character
no
one
could
deny
)
,
was
satisfied
also
.
<EOS>
Under
these
circumstances
,
and
with
the
many
demands
already
made
on
him
,
he
must
decline
entering
into
any
disputes
on
the
subject
of
evidence
.
<EOS>
Time
would
show
;
and
Mr.
Bruff
was
willing
to
wait
for
time
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
quite
plain
 
even
if
Mr.
Blake
had
not
made
it
plainer
still
by
reporting
the
substance
of
the
letter
,
instead
of
reading
what
was
actually
written
 
that
distrust
of
me
was
at
the
bottom
of
all
this
.
<EOS>
Having
myself
foreseen
that
result
,
I
was
neither
mortified
nor
surprised
.
<EOS>
I
asked
Mr.
Blake
if
his
friend
's
protest
had
shaken
him
.
<EOS>
He
answered
emphatically
,
that
it
had
not
produced
the
slightest
effect
on
his
mind
.
<EOS>
I
was
free
after
that
to
dismiss
Mr.
Bruff
from
consideration
 
<EOS>
and
I
did
dismiss
him
accordingly
.
  
<EOS>
A
pause
in
the
talk
between
us
,
followed
 
and
Gabriel
Betteredge
came
out
from
his
retirement
at
the
window
.
  
<EOS>
"
Can
you
favour
me
with
your
attention
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
he
inquired
,
addressing
himself
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
quite
at
your
service
,
"
I
answered
.
  
<EOS>
Betteredge
took
a
chair
and
seated
himself
at
the
table
.
<EOS>
He
produced
a
huge
old
-
fashioned
leather
pocket
-
book
,
with
a
pencil
of
dimensions
to
match
.
<EOS>
Having
put
on
his
spectacles
,
he
opened
the
pocket
-
book
,
at
a
blank
page
,
and
addressed
himself
to
me
once
more
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
lived
,
"
said
Betteredge
,
looking
at
me
sternly
<EOS>
,
"
nigh
on
fifty
years
in
the
service
of
my
late
lady
.
<EOS>
I
was
page
-
boy
before
that
,
in
the
service
of

<EOS>
I
am
now
somewhere
between
seventy
and
eighty
years
of
age
 
never
mind
exactly
where
!
<EOS>
I
am
reckoned
to
have
got
as
pretty
a
knowledge
and
experience
of
the
world
as
most
men
.
<EOS>
And
what
does
it
all
end
in
?
<EOS>
It
ends
,
Mr.
Ezra
Jennings
,
in
a
conjuring
trick
being
performed
on
Mr.
Franklin
Blake
,
by
a
doctor
's
assistant
with
a
bottle
of
laudanum
 
and
by
the
living
jingo
,
I
'm
appointed
,
in
my
old
age
,
to
be
conjurer
's
boy
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Blake
burst
out
laughing
.
<EOS>
I
attempted
to
speak
.
<EOS>
Betteredge
held
up
his
hand
,
in
token
that
he
had
not
done
yet
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
a
word
,
Mr.
Jennings
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
"
It
do
n't
want
a
word
,
sir
,
from
you
.
<EOS>
I
have
got
my
principles
,
thank
God
.
<EOS>
If
an
order
comes
to
me
,
which
is
own
brother
to
an

come
from
Bedlam

it
do
n't
matter
.
<EOS>
So
long
as
I
get
it
from
my
master
or
mistress
,
as
the
case
may
be
,
I
obey
it
.
<EOS>
I
may
have
my
own
opinion
,
which
is
also
,
you
will
please
to
remember
,
the
opinion
of
Mr.
Bruff
 
the
Great
Mr.
Bruff
!
"
<EOS>
said
Betteredge
,
raising
his
voice
,
and
shaking
his
head
at
me
solemnly
.
<EOS>
"
It
do
n't
matter
;
I
withdraw
my
opinion
,
for
all
that
.
<EOS>
My
young
lady
says
,
"
Do
it
.
"
<EOS>
And
I
say
,
"
Miss
,
it
shall
be
done
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Here
I
am
,
with
my
book
and
my
pencil
 
<EOS>
the
latter
not
pointed
so
well
as
I
could
wish
,
but
when
Christians
take
leave
of
their
senses
,
who
is
to
expect
that
pencils
will
keep
their
points
?
<EOS>
Give
me
your
orders
,
Mr.
Jennings
.
<EOS>
I
'll
have
them
in
writing
,
sir
.
<EOS>
I
'm
determined
not
to
be
behind
'em
,
or
before
'em
,
by
so
much
as
a
hair
's
breadth
.
<EOS>
I
'm
a
blind
agent
 
<EOS>
that
's
what
I
am
.
<EOS>
A
blind
agent
!
"
<EOS>
repeated
Betteredge
,
with
infinite
relish
of
his
own
description
of
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
sorry
,
"
I
began
,
"
that
you
and
I
do
n't
agree
 
"
  
"
Do
n't
bring
ME
,
into
it
!
"
<EOS>
interposed
Betteredge
.
<EOS>
"
This
is
not
a
matter
of
agreement
,
it
's
a
matter
of
obedience
.
<EOS>
Issue
your
directions
,
sir
 
issue
your
directions
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Blake
made
me
a
sign
to
take
him
at
his
word
.
<EOS>
I
"
issued
my
directions
"
as
plainly
and
as
gravely
as
I
could
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
certain
parts
of
the
house
to
be
reopened
,
"
I
said
,
"
and
to
be
furnished
,
exactly
as
they
were
furnished
at
this
time
last
year
.
"
  
<EOS>
Betteredge
gave
his
imperfectly
-
pointed
pencil
a
preliminary
lick
with
his
tongue
.
<EOS>
"
Name
the
parts
,
Mr.
Jennings
!
"
he
said
loftily
.
  
<EOS>
"
First
,
the
inner
hall
,
leading
to
the
chief
staircase
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
"
First
,
the
inner
hall
,
"
"
Betteredge
wrote
.
<EOS>
"
Impossible
to
furnish
that
,
sir
,
as
it
was
furnished
last
year
 
to
begin
with
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Because
there
was
a
stuffed
buzzard
,
Mr.
Jennings
,
in
the
hall
last
year
.
<EOS>
When
the
family
left
,
the
buzzard
was
put
away
with
the
other
things
.
<EOS>
When
the
buzzard
was
put
away
 
he
burst
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
will
except
the
buzzard
then
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Betteredge
took
a
note
of
the
exception
.
"
<EOS>
"
The
inner
hall
to
be
furnished
again
,
as
furnished
last
year

<EOS>
A
burst
buzzard

n't
be

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Because
the
man
who
laid
that
carpet
down
is
dead
,
Mr.
Jennings
 
and
the
like
of
him
for
reconciling
together
a

England

you

<EOS>
"
Very
well
.
<EOS>
We
must
try
the
next
best
man
in
England
.
"
  
<EOS>
Betteredge
took
another
note
;
and
I
went
on
issuing
my
directions
.
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Verinder
's
sitting
-
room

be
restored
exactly
to
what
it
was

bedroom

last
June
by
Mr.
Franklin
Blake

"
  
<EOS>
Betteredge
's
blunt
pencil
followed
me
conscientiously
,
word
by
word
.
"
<EOS>
Go
on
,
sir
,
"
he
said
,
with
sardonic
gravity
.
<EOS>
"
There
's
a
deal
of
writing
left
in
the
point
of
this
pencil
yet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
told
him
that
I
had
no
more
directions
to
give
.
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
said
Betteredge
,
"
in
that
case
,
I
have
a
point
or
two
to
put
on
my
own
behalf
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
opened
the
pocket
-
book
at
a
new
page
,
and
gave
the
inexhaustible
pencil
another
preliminary
lick
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
to
know
,
"
he
began
,
"
whether
I
may
,
or
may
not
,
wash
my
hands
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
You
may
decidedly
,
"
said
Mr.
Blake
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
ring
for
the
waiter
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
 
of
certain
responsibilities
,
"
pursued
Betteredge
,
impenetrably
declining
to
see
anybody
in
the
room
but
himself
and
me
.
"
<EOS>
As
to
Miss
Verinder
's
sitting
-
room
,
to
begin
with
.
<EOS>
When
we
took
up
the
carpet
last
year
,
Mr.
Jennings
,
we
found
a
surprising
quantity
of
pins
.
<EOS>
Am
I
responsible
for
putting
back
the
pins
?
"
  
"
Certainly
not
.
"
  
<EOS>
Betteredge
made
a
note
of
that
concession
,
on
the
spot
.
  
<EOS>
"
As
to
the
first
corridor
next
,
"
he
resumed
.
<EOS>
"
When
we
moved
the
ornaments
in
that
part
,
we
moved
a
statue
of
a
fat
naked
child
 
profanely
described
in
the
catalogue
of
the
house
as
"
Cupid
,
god
of
Love
.
"
<EOS>
He
had
two
wings
last
year
,
in
the
fleshy
part
of
his
shoulders
.
<EOS>
My
eye
being
off
him
,
for
the
moment
,
he
lost
one
of
them
.
<EOS>
Am
I
responsible
for
Cupid
's
wing
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
made
another
concession
,
and
Betteredge
made
another
note
.
  
<EOS>
"
As
to
the
second
corridor
,
"
he
went
on
.
<EOS>
"
There
having
been
nothing
in
it
,
last
year
,
but
the
doors
of
the
rooms
(
to
every
one
of
which
I
can
swear
,
if
necessary
)
,
my
mind
is
easy
,
I
admit
,
respecting
that
part
of
the
house
only
.
<EOS>
But
,
as
to
Mr.
Franklin
's
bedroom
(
if
THAT
is
to
be
put
back
to
what
it
was
before
)
,
I
want
to
know
who
is
responsible
for
keeping
it
in
a
perpetual
state
of
litter
,
no
matter
how
often
it
may
be
set
right
 
his
trousers
here
,
his
towels
there
,
and
his
French
novels
everywhere
.
<EOS>
I
say
,
who
is
responsible
for
untidying
the
tidiness
of
Mr.
Franklin
's
room
,
him
or
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Blake
declared
that
he
would
assume
the
whole
responsibility
with
the
greatest
pleasure
.
<EOS>
Betteredge
obstinately
declined
to
listen
to
any
solution
of
the
difficulty
,
without
first
referring
it
to
my
sanction
and
approval
.
<EOS>
I
accepted
Mr.
Blake
's
proposal
;
and
Betteredge
made
a
last
entry
in
the
pocket
-
book
to
that
effect
.
  
<EOS>
"
Look
in
when
you
like
,
Mr.
Jennings
,
beginning
from
to
-
morrow
,
"
he
said
,
getting
on
his
legs
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
find
me
at
work
,
with
the
necessary
persons
to
assist
me
.
<EOS>
I
respectfully
beg
to
thank
you
,
sir
,
for
overlooking
the
case
of
the
stuffed
buzzard
,
and
the
other
case
of
the
Cupid
's
wing
 
as
also
for
permitting
me
to
wash
my
hands
of
all
responsibility
in
respect
of
the
pins
on
the
carpet
,
and
the
litter
in
Mr.
Franklin
's
room
.
<EOS>
Speaking
as
a
servant
,
I
am
deeply
indebted
to
you
.
<EOS>
Speaking
as
a
man
,
I
consider
you
to
be
a
person
whose
head
is
full
of
maggots
,
and
I
take
up
my
testimony
against
your
experiment
as
a
delusion
and
a
snare
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
be
afraid
,
on
that
account
,
of
my
feelings
as
a
man
getting
in
the
way
of
my
duty
as
a
servant
!
<EOS>
You
shall
be
obeyed
.
<EOS>
The
maggots
notwithstanding
,
sir
,
you
shall
be
obeyed
.
<EOS>
If
it
ends
in
your
setting
the
house
on
fire
,
Damme
if
I
send
for
the
engines
,
unless
you
ring
the
bell
and
order
them
first
!
"
  
<EOS>
With
that
farewell
assurance
,
he
made
me
a
bow
,
and
walked
out
of
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
think
we
can
depend
on
him
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
Implicitly
,
"
answered
Mr.
Blake
.
<EOS>
"
When
we
go
to
the
house
,
we
shall
find
nothing
neglected
,
and
nothing
forgotten
.

<EOS>
June
19th
.
 
<EOS>
Another
protest
against
our
contemplated
proceedings
!
<EOS>
From
a
lady
this
time
.
  
<EOS>
The
morning
's
post
brought
me
two
letters
.
<EOS>
One
from
Miss
Verinder
,
consenting
,
in
the
kindest
manner
,
to
the
arrangement
that
I
have
proposed
.
<EOS>
The
other
from
the
lady
under
whose
care
she
is
living
 
one
Mrs.
Merridew
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Merridew
presents
her
compliments
,
and
does
not
pretend
to
understand
the
subject
on
which
I
have
been
corresponding
with
Miss
Verinder
,
in
its
scientific
bearings
.
<EOS>
Viewed
in
its
social
bearings
,
however
,
she
feels
free
to
pronounce
an
opinion
.
<EOS>
I
am
probably
,
Mrs.
Merridew
thinks
,
not
aware
that
Miss
Verinder
is
barely
nineteen
years
of
age
.
<EOS>
To
allow
a
young
lady
,
at
her
time
of
life
,
to
be
present
(
without
a
"
chaperone
"
)
in
a
house
full
of
men
among
whom
a
medical
experiment
is
being
carried
on
,
is
an
outrage
on
propriety
which
Mrs.
Merridew
can
not
possibly
permit
.
<EOS>
If
the
matter
is
allowed
to
proceed
,
she
will
feel
it
to
be
her
duty
 
at
a
serious
sacrifice
of
her
own
personal
convenience
 
to
accompany
Miss
Verinder
to
Yorkshire
.
<EOS>
Under
these
circumstances
,
she
ventures
to
request
that
I
will
kindly
reconsider
the
subject
;
seeing
that
Miss
Verinder
declines
to
be
guided
by
any
opinion
but
mine
.
<EOS>
Her
presence
can
not
possibly
be
necessary
;
and
a
word
from
me
,
to
that
effect
,
would
relieve
both
Mrs.
Merridew
and
myself
of
a
very
unpleasant
responsibility
.
  
<EOS>
Translated
from
polite
commonplace
into
plain
English
,
the
meaning
of
this
is
,
as
I
take
it
,
that
Mrs.
Merridew
stands
in
mortal
fear
of
the
opinion
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
She
has
unfortunately
appealed
to
the
very
last
man
in
existence
who
has
any
reason
to
regard
that
opinion
with
respect
.
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
disappoint
Miss
Verinder
;
and
I
wo
n't
delay
a
reconciliation
between
two
young
people
who
love
each
other
,
and
who
have
been
parted
too
long
already
.
<EOS>
Translated
from
plain
English
into
polite
commonplace
,
this
means
that
Mr.
Jennings
presents
his
compliments
to
Mrs.
Merridew
,
and
regrets
that
he
can
not
feel
justified
in
interfering
any
farther
in
the
matter
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Blake
's
report
of
himself
,
this
morning
,
was
the
same
as
before
.
<EOS>
We
determined
not
to
disturb
Betteredge
by
overlooking
him
at
the
house
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
To
-
morrow
will
be
time
enough
for
our
first
visit
of
inspection
.
  
<EOS>
June
20th
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Blake
is
beginning
to
feel
his
continued
restlessness
at
night
.
<EOS>
The
sooner
the
rooms
are
refurnished
,
now
,
the
better
.
  
<EOS>
On
our
way
to
the
house
,
this
morning
,
he
consulted
me
,
with
some
nervous
impatience
and
irresolution
,
about
a
letter
<EOS>
(
forwarded
to
him
from
London
)
which
he
had
received
from
Sergeant
Cuff
.
  
<EOS>
The
Sergeant
writes
from
Ireland
.
<EOS>
He
acknowledges
the
receipt
(
through
his
housekeeper
)
of
a
card
and
message
which
Mr.
Blake
left
at
his
residence
near
Dorking
,
and
announces
his
return
to
England
as
likely
to
take
place
in
a
week
or
less
.
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
,
he
requests
to
be
favoured
with
Mr.
Blake
's
reasons
for
wishing
to
speak
to
him
(
as
stated
in
the
message
)
on
the
subject
of
the
Moonstone
.
<EOS>
If
Mr.
Blake
can
convict
him
of
having
made
any
serious
mistake
,
in
the
course
of
his
last
year
's
inquiry
concerning
the
Diamond
,
he
will
consider
it
a
duty
(
after
the
liberal
manner
in
which
he
was
treated
by
the
late
Lady
Verinder
)
to
place
himself
at
that
gentleman
's
disposal
.
<EOS>
If
not
,
he
begs
permission
to
remain
in
his
retirement
,
surrounded
by
the
peaceful
horticultural
attractions
of
a
country
life
.
  
<EOS>
After
reading
the
letter
,
I
had
no
hesitation
in
advising
Mr.
Blake
to
inform
Sergeant
Cuff
,
in
reply
,
of
all
that
had
happened
since
the
inquiry
was
suspended
last
year
,
and
to
leave
him
to
draw
his
own
conclusions
from
the
plain
facts
.
  
<EOS>
On
second
thoughts
I
also
suggested
inviting
the
Sergeant
to
be
present
at
the
experiment
,
in
the
event
of
his
returning
to
England
in
time
to
join
us
.
<EOS>
He
would
be
a
valuable
witness
to
have
,
in
any
case
;
and
,
if
I
proved
to
be
wrong
in
believing
the
Diamond
to
be
hidden
in
Mr.
Blake
's
room
,
his
advice
might
be
of
great
importance
,
at
a
future
stage
of
the
proceedings
over
which
I
could
exercise
no
control
.
<EOS>
This
last
consideration
appeared
to
decide
Mr.
Blake
.
<EOS>
He
promised
to
follow
my
advice
.
  
<EOS>
The
sound
of
the
hammer
informed
us
that
the
work
of
re
-
furnishing
was
in
full
progress
,
as
we
entered
the
drive
that
led
to
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
Betteredge
,
attired
for
the
occasion
in
a
fisherman
's
red
cap
,
and
an
apron
of
green
baize
,
met
us
in
the
outer
hall
.
<EOS>
The
moment
he
saw
me
,
he
pulled
out
the
pocket
-
book
and
pencil
,
and
obstinately
insisted
on
taking
notes
of
everything
that
I
said
to
him
.
<EOS>
Look
where
we
might
,
we
found
,
as
Mr.
Blake
had
foretold
that
the
work
was
advancing
as
rapidly
and
as
intelligently
as
it
was
possible
to
desire
.
<EOS>
But
there
was
still
much
to
be
done
in
the
inner
hall
,
and
in
Miss
Verinder
's
room
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
doubtful
whether
the
house
would
be
ready
for
us
before
the
end
of
the
week
.
  
<EOS>
Having
congratulated
Betteredge
on
the
progress
that
he
had
made
(
he
persisted
in
taking
notes
every
time
I
opened
my
lips
;
declining
,
at
the
same
time
,
to
pay
the
slightest
attention
to
anything
said
by
Mr.
Blake
)
;
and
having
promised
to
return
for
a
second
visit
of
inspection
in
a
day
or
two
,
we
prepared
to
leave
the
house
,
going
out
by
the
back
way
.
<EOS>
Before
we
were
clear
of
the
passages
downstairs
,
I
was
stopped
by
Betteredge
,
just
as
I
was
passing
the
door
which
led
into
his
own
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
Could
I
say
two
words
to
you
in
private
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
,
in
a
mysterious
whisper
.
  
<EOS>
I
consented
of
course
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Blake
walked
on
to
wait
for
me
in
the
garden
,
while
I
accompanied
Betteredge
into
his
room
.
<EOS>
I
fully
anticipated
a
demand
for
certain
new
concessions
,
following
the
precedent
already
established
in
the
cases
of
the
stuffed
buzzard
,
and
the
Cupid
's
wing
.
<EOS>
To
my
great
surprise
,
Betteredge
laid
his
hand
confidentially
on
my
arm
,
and
put
this
extraordinary
question
to
me
:
  
"
Mr.
Jennings
,
do
you
happen
to
be
acquainted
with
ROBINSON
CRUSOE
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
answered
that
I
had
read
ROBINSON
CRUSOE
when
I
was
a
child
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
since
then
?
"
inquired
Betteredge
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
since
then
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
fell
back
a
few
steps
,
and
looked
at
me
with
an
expression
of
compassionate
curiosity
,
tempered
by
superstitious
awe
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
has
not
read
ROBINSON
CRUSOE
since
he
was
a
child
,
"
said
Betteredge
,
speaking
to
himself
 
not
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Let
's
try
how
ROBINSON
CRUSOE
strikes
him
now
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
unlocked
a
cupboard
in
a
corner
,
and
produced
a
dirty
and
dog's
-
eared
book
,
which
exhaled
a
strong
odour
of
stale
tobacco
as
he
turned
over
the
leaves
.
<EOS>
Having
found
a
passage
of
which
he
was
apparently
in
search
,
he
requested
me
to
join
him
in
the
corner
;
still
mysteriously
confidential
,
and
still
speaking
under
his
breath
.
  
<EOS>
"
In
respect
to
this
hocus
-
pocus
of
yours
,
sir
,
with
the
laudanum
and
Mr.
Franklin
Blake
,
"
he
began
.
<EOS>
"
While
the
workpeople
are
in
the
house
,
my
duty
as
a
servant
gets
the
better
of
my
feelings
as
a
man
.
<EOS>
When
the
workpeople
are
gone
,
my
feelings
as
a
man
get
the
better
of
my
duty
as
a
servant
.
<EOS>
Very
good
.
<EOS>
Last
night
,
Mr.
Jennings
,
it
was
borne
in
powerfully
on
my
mind
that
this
new
medical
enterprise
of
yours
would
end
badly
.
<EOS>
If
I
had
yielded
to
that
secret
Dictate
,
I
should
have
put
all
the
furniture
away
again
with
my
own
hand
,
and
have
warned
the
workmen
off
the
premises
when
they
came
the
next
morning
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
to
find
,
from
what
I
have
seen
up
-
stairs
,
"
I
said
,
"
that
you
resisted
the
secret
Dictate
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Resisted
is
n't
the
word
,
"
answered
Betteredge
.
<EOS>
"
Wrostled
is
the
word
.
<EOS>
I
wrostled
,
sir
,
between
the
silent
orders
in
my
bosom
pulling
me
one
way
,
and
the
written
orders
in
my
pocket
-
book
pushing
me
the
other
,
until
(
saving
your
presence
)
<EOS>
I
was
in
a
cold
sweat
.
<EOS>
In
that
dreadful
perturbation
of
mind
and
laxity
of
body
,
to
what
remedy
did
I
apply
?
<EOS>
To
the
remedy
,
sir
,
which
has
never
failed
me
yet
for
the
last
thirty
years
and
more
 
to
This
Book
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
hit
the
book
a
sounding
blow
with
his
open
hand
,
and
struck
out
of
it
a
stronger
smell
of
stale
tobacco
than
ever
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
did
I
find
here
,
"
pursued
Betteredge
,
"
at
the
first
page
I
opened
?
<EOS>
This
awful
bit
,
sir
,
page
one
hundred
and
seventy
-
eight
,
as
follows
.
 
<EOS>
"
Upon
these
,
and
many
like
Reflections
,
I
afterwards
made
it
a
certain
rule
with
me
,
That
whenever
I
found
those
secret
Hints
or
Pressings
of
my
Mind
,
to
doing
,
or
not
doing
any
Thing
that
presented
;
or
to
going
this
Way
,
or
that
Way
,
I
never
failed
to
obey
the
secret
Dictate
.
<EOS>
"
As
I
live
by
bread
,
Mr.
Jennings
,
those
were
the
first
words
that
met
my
eye
,
exactly
at
the
time
when
I
myself
was
setting
the
secret
Dictate
at
defiance
!
<EOS>
You
do
n't
see
anything
at
all
out
of
the
common
in
that
,
do
you
,
sir
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
see
a
coincidence
 
nothing
more
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
feel
at
all
shaken
,
Mr.
Jennings
,
in
respect
to
this
medical
enterprise
of
yours
?
  
<EOS>
"
Not
the
least
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Betteredge
stared
hard
at
me
,
in
dead
silence
.
<EOS>
He
closed
the
book
with
great
deliberation
;
he
locked
it
up
again
in
the
cupboard
with
extraordinary
care
;
he
wheeled
round
,
and
stared
hard
at
me
once
more
.
<EOS>
Then
he
spoke
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
he
said
gravely
,
"
there
are
great
allowances
to
be
made
for
a
man
who
has
not
read
ROBINSON
CRUSOE
since
he
was
a
child
.
<EOS>
I
wish
you
good
morning
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
opened
his
door
with
a
low
bow
,
and
left
me
at
liberty
to
find
my
own
way
into
the
garden
.
<EOS>
I
met
Mr.
Blake
returning
to
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
need
n't
tell
me
what
has
happened
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
Betteredge
has
played
his
last
card
:
he
has
made
another
prophetic
discovery
in
ROBINSON
CRUSOE
.
<EOS>
Have
you
humoured
his
favourite
delusion
?
<EOS>
No
?
<EOS>
You
have
let
him
see
that
you
do
n't
believe
in
ROBINSON
CRUSOE
?
<EOS>
Mr.
Jennings
!
<EOS>
you
have
fallen
to
the
lowest
possible
place
in
Betteredge
's
estimation
.
<EOS>
Say
what
you
like
,
and
do
what
you
like
,
for
the
future
.
<EOS>
You
will
find
that
he
wo
n't
waste
another
word
on
you
now
.
"
  
<EOS>
June
21st
.
 
<EOS>
A
short
entry
must
suffice
in
my
journal
to
-
day
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Blake
has
had
the
worst
night
that
he
has
passed
yet
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
obliged
,
greatly
against
my
will
,
to
prescribe
for
him
.
<EOS>
Men
of
his
sensitive
organisation
are
fortunately
quick
in
feeling
the
effect
of
remedial
measures
.
<EOS>
Otherwise
,
I
should
be
inclined
to
fear
that
he
will
be
totally
unfit
for
the
experiment
when
the
time
comes
to
try
it
.
  
<EOS>
As
for
myself
,
after
some
little
remission
of
my
pains
for
the
last
two
days
I
had
an
attack
this
morning
,
of
which
I
shall
say
nothing
but
that
it
has
decided
me
to
return
to
the
opium
.
<EOS>
I
shall
close
this
book
,
and
take
my
full
dose
 
five
hundred
drops
.
  
<EOS>
June
22nd
.
 
<EOS>
Our
prospects
look
better
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Blake
's
nervous
suffering
is
greatly
allayed
.
<EOS>
He
slept
a
little
last
night
.
<EOS>
MY
night
,
thanks
to
the
opium
,
was
the
night
of
a
man
who
is
stunned
.
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
say
that
I
woke
this
morning
;
the
fitter
expression
would
be
,
that
I
recovered
my
senses
.
  
<EOS>
We
drove
to
the
house
to
see
if
the
refurnishing
was
done
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
completed
to
-
morrow
 
Saturday
.
<EOS>
As
Mr.
Blake
foretold
,
Betteredge
raised
no
further
obstacles
.
<EOS>
From
first
to
last
,
he
was
ominously
polite
,
and
ominously
silent
.
  
<EOS>
My
medical
enterprise
(
as
Betteredge
calls
it
)
must
now
,
inevitably
,
be
delayed
until
Monday
next
.
<EOS>
To
-
morrow
evening
the
workmen
will
be
late
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
On
the
next
day
,
the
established
Sunday
tyranny
which
is
one
of
the
institutions
of
this
free
country
,
so
times
the
trains
as
to
make
it
impossible
to
ask
anybody
to
travel
to
us
from
London
.
<EOS>
Until
Monday
comes
,
there
is
nothing
to
be
done
but
to
watch
Mr.
Blake
carefully
,
and
to
keep
him
,
if
possible
,
in
the
same
state
in
which
I
find
him
to
-
day
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
meanwhile
,
I
have
prevailed
on
him
to
write
to
Mr.
Bruff
,
making
a
point
of
it
that
he
shall
be
present
as
one
of
the
witnesses
.
<EOS>
I
especially
choose
the
lawyer
,
because
he
is
strongly
prejudiced
against
us
.
<EOS>
If
we
convince
HIM
,
we
place
our
victory
beyond
the
possibility
of
dispute
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Blake
has
also
written
to
Sergeant
Cuff
;
and
I
have
sent
a
line
to
Miss
Verinder
.
<EOS>
With
these
,
and
with
old
Betteredge
(
who
is
really
a
person
of
importance
in
the
family
)
we
shall
have
witnesses
enough
for
the
purpose
 
without
including
Mrs.
Merridew
,
if
Mrs.
Merridew
persists
in
sacrificing
herself
to
the
opinion
of
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
June
23rd
.
 
<EOS>
The
vengeance
of
the
opium
overtook
me
again
last
night
.
<EOS>
No
matter
;
I
must
go
on
with
it
now
till
Monday
is
past
and
gone
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Blake
is
not
so
well
again
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
At
two
this
morning
,
he
confesses
that
he
opened
the
drawer
in
which
his
cigars
are
put
away
.
<EOS>
He
only
succeeded
in
locking
it
up
again
by
a
violent
effort
.
<EOS>
His
next
proceeding
,
in
case
of
temptation
,
was
to
throw
the
key
out
of
window
.
<EOS>
The
waiter
brought
it
in
this
morning
,
discovered
at
the
bottom
of
an
empty
cistern
 
<EOS>
such
is
Fate
!
<EOS>
I
have
taken
possession
of
the
key
until
Tuesday
next
.
  
<EOS>
June
24th
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Blake
<EOS>
and
I
took
a
long
drive
in
an
open
carriage
.
<EOS>
We
both
felt
beneficially
the
blessed
influence
of
the
soft
summer
air
.
<EOS>
I
dined
with
him
at
the
hotel
.
<EOS>
To
my
great
relief
 
for
I
found
him
in
an
over
-
wrought
,
over
-
excited
state
this
morning
 
<EOS>
he
had
two
hours
'
sound
sleep
on
the
sofa
after
dinner
.
<EOS>
If
he
has
another
bad
night
,
now
 
I
am
not
afraid
of
the
consequence
.
  
<EOS>
June
25th
,
Monday
.
 
<EOS>
The
day
of
the
experiment
!
<EOS>
It
is
five
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
.
<EOS>
We
have
just
arrived
at
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
The
first
and
foremost
question
,
is
the
question
of
Mr.
Blake
's
health
.
  
<EOS>
So
far
as
it
is
possible
for
me
to
judge
,
he
promises
(
physically
speaking
)
to
be
quite
as
susceptible
to
the
action
of
the
opium
to
-
night
as
he
was
at
this
time
last
year
.
<EOS>
He
is
,
this
afternoon
,
in
a
state
of
nervous
sensitiveness
which
just
stops
short
of
nervous
irritation
.
<EOS>
He
changes
colour
readily
;
his
hand
is
not
quite
steady
;
and
he
starts
at
chance
noises
,
and
at
unexpected
appearances
of
persons
and
things
.
  
<EOS>
These
results
have
all
been
produced
by
deprivation
of
sleep
,
which
is
in
its
turn
the
nervous
consequence
of
a
sudden
cessation
in
the
habit
of
smoking
,
after
that
habit
has
been
carried
to
an
extreme
.
<EOS>
Here
are
the
same
causes
at
work
again
,
which
operated
last
year
;
and
here
are
,
apparently
,
the
same
effects
.
<EOS>
Will
the
parallel
still
hold
good
,
when
the
final
test
has
been
tried
?
<EOS>
The
events
of
the
night
must
decide
.
  
<EOS>
While
I
write
these
lines
,
Mr.
Blake
is
amusing
himself
at
the
billiard
table
in
the
inner
hall
,
practising
different
strokes
in
the
game
,
as
he
was
accustomed
to
practise
them
when
he
was
a
guest
in
this
house
in
June
last
.
<EOS>
I
have
brought
my
journal
here
,
partly
with
a
view
to
occupying
the
idle
hours
which
I
am
sure
to
have
on
my
hands
between
this
and
to
-
morrow
morning
;
partly
in
the
hope
that
something
may
happen
which
it
may
be
worth
my
while
to
place
on
record
at
the
time
.
  
<EOS>
Have
I
omitted
anything
,
thus
far
?
<EOS>
A
glance
at
yesterday
's
entry
shows
me
that
I
have
forgotten
to
note
the
arrival
of
the
morning
's
post
.
<EOS>
Let
me
set
this
right
before
I
close
these
leaves
for
the
present
,
and
join
Mr.
Blake
.
  
<EOS>
I
received
a
few
lines
then
,
yesterday
,
from
Miss
Verinder
.
<EOS>
She
has
arranged
to
travel
by
the
afternoon
train
,
as
I
recommended
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Merridew
has
insisted
on
accompanying
her
.
<EOS>
The
note
hints
that
the
old
lady
's
generally
excellent
temper
is
a
little
ruffled
,
and
requests
all
due
indulgence
for
her
,
in
consideration
of
her
age
and
her
habits
.
<EOS>
I
will
endeavour
,
in
my
relations
with
Mrs.
Merridew
,
to
emulate
the
moderation
which
Betteredge
displays
in
his
relations
with
me
.
<EOS>
He
received
us
to
-
day
,
portentously
arrayed
in
his
best
black
suit
,
and
his
stiffest
white
cravat
.
<EOS>
Whenever
he
looks
my
way
,
he
remembers
that
I
have
not
read
ROBINSON
CRUSOE
since
I
was
a
child
,
and
he
respectfully
pities
me
.
  
<EOS>
Yesterday
,
also
,
Mr.
Blake
had
the
lawyer
's
answer
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bruff
accepts
the
invitation
 
under
protest
.
<EOS>
It
is
,
he
thinks
,
clearly
necessary
that
a
gentleman
possessed
of
the
average
allowance
of
common
sense
,
should
accompany
Miss
Verinder
to
the
scene
of
,
what
we
will
venture
to
call
,
the
proposed
exhibition
.
<EOS>
For
want
of
a
better
escort
,
Mr.
Bruff
himself
will
be
that
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
So
here
is
poor
Miss
Verinder
provided
with
two
"
chaperones
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
relief
to
think
that
the
opinion
of
the
world
must
surely
be
satisfied
with
this
!
  
<EOS>
Nothing
has
been
heard
of
Sergeant
Cuff
.
<EOS>
He
is
no
doubt
still
in
Ireland
.
<EOS>
We
must
not
expect
to
see
him
to
-
night
.
  
<EOS>
Betteredge
has
just
come
in
,
to
say
that
Mr.
Blake
has
asked
for
me
.
<EOS>
I
must
lay
down
my
pen
for
the
present
.
     
<EOS>
Seven
o'clock
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
been
all
over
the
refurnished
rooms
and
staircases
again
;
and
we
have
had
a
pleasant
stroll
in
the
shrubbery
,
which
was
Mr.
Blake
's
favourite
walk
when
he
was
here
last
.
<EOS>
In
this
way
,
I
hope
to
revive
the
old
impressions
of
places
and
things
as
vividly
as
possible
in
his
mind
.
  
<EOS>
We
are
now
going
to
dine
,
exactly
at
the
hour
at
which
the
birthday
dinner
was
given
last
year
.
<EOS>
My
object
,
of
course
,
is
a
purely
medical
one
in
this
case
.
<EOS>
The
laudanum
must
find
the
process
of
digestion
,
as
nearly
as
may
be
,
where
the
laudanum
found
it
last
year
.
  
<EOS>
At
a
reasonable
time
after
dinner
I
propose
to
lead
the
conversation
back
again
 
as
inartificially
as
I
can
 
to
the
subject
of
the
Diamond
,
and
of
the
Indian
conspiracy
to
steal
it
.
<EOS>
When
I
have
filled
his
mind
with
these
topics
,
I
shall
have
done
all
that
it
is
in
my
power
to
do
,
before
the
time
comes
for
giving
him
the
second
dose
.
     
<EOS>
Half
-
past
eight
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
only
this
moment
found
an
opportunity
of
attending
to
the
most
important
duty
of
all
;
the
duty
of
looking
in
the
family
medicine
chest
,
for
the
laudanum
which
Mr.
Candy
used
last
year
.
  
<EOS>
Ten
minutes
since
,
I
caught
Betteredge
at
an
unoccupied
moment
,
and
told
him
what
I
wanted
.
<EOS>
Without
a
word
of
objection
,
without
so
much
as
an
attempt
to
produce
his
pocket
-
book
,
he
led
the
way
(
making
allowances
for
me
at
every
step
)
to
the
store
-
room
in
which
the
medicine
chest
is
kept
.
  
<EOS>
I
discovered
the
bottle
,
carefully
guarded
by
a
glass
stopper
tied
over
with
leather
.
<EOS>
The
preparation
which
it
contained
was
,
as
I
had
anticipated
,
the
common
Tincture
of
Opium
.
<EOS>
Finding
the
bottle
still
well
filled
,
I
have
resolved
to
use
it
,
in
preference
to
employing
either
of
the
two
preparations
with
which
I
had
taken
care
to
provide
myself
,
in
case
of
emergency
.
  
<EOS>
The
question
of
the
quantity
which
I
am
to
administer
presents
certain
difficulties
.
<EOS>
I
have
thought
it
over
,
and
have
decided
on
increasing
the
dose
.
  
<EOS>
My
notes
inform
me
that
Mr.
Candy
only
administered
twenty
-
five
minims
.
<EOS>
This
is
a
small
dose
to
have
produced
the
results
which
followed
 
even
in
the
case
of
a
person
so
sensitive
as
Mr.
Blake
.
<EOS>
I
think
it
highly
probable
that
Mr.
Candy
gave
more
than
he
supposed
himself
to
have
given
 
knowing
,
as
I
do
,
that
he
has
a
keen
relish
of
the
pleasures
of
the
table
,
and
that
he
measured
out
the
laudanum
on
the
birthday
,
after
dinner
.
<EOS>
In
any
case
,
I
shall
run
the
risk
of
enlarging
the
dose
to
forty
minims
.
<EOS>
On
this
occasion
,
Mr.
Blake
knows
beforehand
that
he
is
going
to
take
the
laudanum
 
which
is
equivalent
,
physiologically
speaking
,
to
his
having
(
unconsciously
to
himself
)
<EOS>
a
certain
capacity
in
him
to
resist
the
effects
.
<EOS>
If
my
view
is
right
,
a
larger
quantity
is
therefore
imperatively
required
,
this
time
,
to
repeat
the
results
which
the
smaller
quantity
produced
,
last
year
.
     
<EOS>
Ten
o'clock
.
 
<EOS>
The
witnesses
,
or
the
company
(
<EOS>
which
shall
I
call
them
?
)
<EOS>
reached
the
house
an
hour
since
.
  
<EOS>
A
little
before
nine
o'clock
,
I
prevailed
on
Mr.
Blake
to
accompany
me
to
his
bedroom
;
stating
,
as
a
reason
,
that
I
wished
him
to
look
round
it
,
for
the
last
time
,
in
order
to
make
quite
sure
that
nothing
had
been
forgotten
in
the
refurnishing
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
I
had
previously
arranged
with
Betteredge
,
that
the
bedchamber
prepared
for
Mr.
Bruff
should
be
the
next
room
to
Mr.
Blake
's
,
and
that
I
should
be
informed
of
the
lawyer
's
arrival
by
a
knock
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
Five
minutes
after
the
clock
in
the
hall
had
struck
nine
<EOS>
,
I
heard
the
knock
;
and
,
going
out
immediately
,
met
Mr.
Bruff
in
the
corridor
.
  
<EOS>
My
personal
appearance
(
as
usual
)
told
against
me
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bruff
's
distrust
looked
at
me
plainly
enough
out
of
Mr.
Bruff
's
eyes
.
<EOS>
Being
well
used
to
producing
this
effect
on
strangers
,
I
did
not
hesitate
a
moment
in
saying
what
I
wanted
to
say
,
before
the
lawyer
found
his
way
into
Mr.
Blake
's
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
travelled
here
,
I
believe
,
in
company
with
Mrs.
Merridew
and
Miss
Verinder
?
<EOS>
"
I
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
answered
Mr.
Bruff
,
as
drily
as
might
be
.
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Verinder
has
probably
told
you
,
that
I
wish
her
presence
in
the
house
(
and
Mrs.
Merridew
's
presence
of
course
)
to
be
kept
a
secret
from
Mr.
Blake
,
until
my
experiment
on
him
has
been
tried
first
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
that
I
am
to
hold
my
tongue
,
sir
!
"
said
Mr.
Bruff
,
impatiently
.
<EOS>
"
Being
habitually
silent
on
the
subject
of
human
folly
,
I
am
all
the
readier
to
keep
my
lips
closed
on
this
occasion
.
<EOS>
Does
that
satisfy
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
bowed
,
and
left
Betteredge
to
show
him
to
his
room
.
<EOS>
Betteredge
gave
me
one
look
at
parting
,
which
said
,
as
if
in
so
many
words
,
"
You
have
caught
a
Tartar
,
<EOS>
Mr.
Jennings
 
and
<EOS>
the
name
of
him
is
Bruff
.
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
next
necessary
to
get
the
meeting
over
with
the
two
ladies
.
<EOS>
I
descended
the
stairs
 
<EOS>
a
little
nervously
,
I
confess
 
on
my
way
to
Miss
Verinder
's
sitting
-
room
.
  
<EOS>
The
gardener
's
wife
(
charged
with
looking
after
the
accommodation
of
the
ladies
)
met
me
in
the
first
-
floor
corridor
.
<EOS>
This
excellent
woman
treats
me
with
an
excessive
civility
which
is
plainly
the
offspring
of
down
-
right
terror
.
<EOS>
She
stares
,
trembles
,
and
curtseys
,
whenever
I
speak
to
her
.
<EOS>
On
my
asking
for
Miss
Verinder
,
she
stared
,
trembled
,
and
would
no
doubt
have
curtseyed
next
,
if
Miss
Verinder
herself
had
not
cut
that
ceremony
short
,
by
suddenly
opening
her
sitting
-
room
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
that
Mr.
Jennings
?
"
she
asked
.
  
<EOS>
Before
I
could
answer
,
she
came
out
eagerly
to
speak
to
me
in
the
corridor
.
<EOS>
We
met
under
the
light
of
a
lamp
on
a
bracket
.
<EOS>
At
the
first
sight
of
me
,
Miss
Verinder
stopped
,
and
hesitated
.
<EOS>
She
recovered
herself
instantly
,
coloured
for
a
moment
 
and
then
,
with
a
charming
frankness
,
offered
me
her
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
treat
you
like
a
stranger
,
Mr.
Jennings
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
if
you
only
knew
how
happy
your
letters
have
made
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
looked
at
my
ugly
wrinkled
face
,
with
a
bright
gratitude
so
new
to
me
in
my
experience
of
my
fellow
-
creatures
,
that
I
was
at
a
loss
how
to
answer
her
.
<EOS>
Nothing
had
prepared
me
for
her
kindness
and
her
beauty
.
<EOS>
The
misery
of
many
years
has
not
hardened
my
heart
,
thank
God
.
<EOS>
I
was
as
awkward
and
as
shy
with
her
,
as
if
I
had
been
a
lad
in
my
teens
.
  
<EOS>
"
Where
is
he
now
?
"
<EOS>
she
asked
,
giving
free
expression
to
her
one
dominant
interest
 
the
interest
in
Mr.
Blake
.
<EOS>
"
What
is
he
doing
?
<EOS>
Has
he
spoken
of
me
?
<EOS>
Is
he
in
good
spirits
?
<EOS>
How
does
he
bear
the
sight
of
the
house
,
after
what
happened
in
it
last
year
?
<EOS>
When
are
you
going
to
give
him
the
laudanum
?
<EOS>
May
I
see
you
pour
it
out
?
<EOS>
I
am
so
interested
;
I
am
so
excited
 
<EOS>
I
have
ten
thousand
things
to
say
to
you
,
and
they
all
crowd
together
so
that
I
do
n't
know
what
to
say
first
.
<EOS>
Do
you
wonder
at
the
interest
I
take
in
this
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
venture
to
think
that
I
thoroughly
understand
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
was
far
above
the
paltry
affectation
of
being
confused
.
<EOS>
She
answered
me
as
she
might
have
answered
a
brother
or
a
father
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
relieved
me
of
indescribable
wretchedness
;
you
have
given
me
a
new
life
.
<EOS>
How
can
I
be
ungrateful
enough
to
have
any
concealment
from
you
?
<EOS>
I
love
him
,
"
she
said
simply
,
"
I
have
loved
him
from
first
to
last
 
even
when
I
was
wronging
him
in
my
own
thoughts
;
even
when
I
was
saying
the
hardest
and
the
cruellest
words
to
him
.
<EOS>
Is
there
any
excuse
for
me
,
in
that
?
<EOS>
I
hope
there
is
 
<EOS>
I
am
afraid
it
is
the
only
excuse
I
have
.
<EOS>
When
to
-
morrow
comes
,
and
he
knows
that
I
am
in
the
house
,
do
you
think
 
"
  
<EOS>
She
stopped
again
,
and
looked
at
me
very
earnestly
.
  
<EOS>
"
When
to
-
morrow
comes
,
"
I
said
,
"
I
think
you
have
only
to
tell
him
what
you
have
just
told
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Her
face
brightened
;
she
came
a
step
nearer
to
me
.
<EOS>
Her
fingers
trifled
nervously
with
a
flower
which
I
had
picked
in
the
garden
,
and
which
I
had
put
into
the
button
-
hole
of
my
coat
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
seen
a
great
deal
of
him
lately
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
Have
you
,
really
and
truly
,
seen
THAT
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Really
and
truly
,
"
I
answered
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
quite
certain
of
what
will
happen
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
I
wish
I
could
feel
as
certain
of
what
will
happen
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
At
that
point
in
the
conversation
,
we
were
interrupted
by
the
appearance
of
Betteredge
with
the
tea
-
tray
.
<EOS>
He
gave
me
another
significant
look
as
he
passed
on
into
the
sitting
-
room
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Aye
!
<EOS>
aye
!
<EOS>
make
your
hay
while
the
sun
shines
.
<EOS>
The
Tartar
's
upstairs
,
Mr.
Jennings
 
<EOS>
the
Tartar
's
upstairs
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
We
followed
him
into
the
room
.
<EOS>
A
little
old
lady
,
in
a
corner
,
very
nicely
dressed
,
and
very
deeply
absorbed
over
a
smart
piece
of
embroidery
,
dropped
her
work
in
her
lap
,
and
uttered
a
faint
little
scream
at
the
first
sight
of
my
gipsy
complexion
and
my
piebald
hair
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Merridew
,
"
said
Miss
Verinder
,
"
this
is
Mr.
Jennings
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
beg
Mr.
Jennings
's
pardon
,
"
said
the
old
lady
,
looking
at
Miss
Verinder
,
and
speaking
at
me
.
"
<EOS>
Railway
travelling
always
makes
me
nervous
.
<EOS>
I
am
endeavouring
to
quiet
my
mind
by
occupying
myself
as
usual
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
whether
my
embroidery
is
out
of
place
,
on
this
extraordinary
occasion
.
<EOS>
If
it
interferes
with
Mr.
Jennings
's
medical
views
,
I
shall
be
happy
to
put
it
away
of
course
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
hastened
to
sanction
the
presence
of
the
embroidery
,
exactly
as
I
had
sanctioned
the
absence
of
the
burst
buzzard
and
the
Cupid
's
wing
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Merridew
made
an
effort
 
a
grateful
effort
 
to
look
at
my
hair
.
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
it
was
not
to
be
done
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Merridew
looked
back
again
at
Miss
Verinder
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
Mr.
Jennings
will
permit
me
,
"
pursued
the
old
lady
,
"
I
should
like
to
ask
a
favour
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Jennings
is
about
to
try
a
scientific
experiment
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
I
used
to
attend
scientific
experiments
when
I
was
a
girl
at
school
.
<EOS>
They
invariably
ended
in
an
explosion
.
<EOS>
If
Mr.
Jennings
will
be
so
very
kind
,
I
should
like
to
be
warned
of
the
explosion
this
time
.
<EOS>
With
a
view
to
getting
it
over
,
if
possible
,
before
I
go
to
bed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
attempted
to
assure
Mrs.
Merridew
that
an
explosion
was
not
included
in
the
programme
on
this
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
the
old
lady
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
much
obliged
to
Mr.
Jennings
 
<EOS>
I
am
aware
that
he
is
only
deceiving
me
for
my
own
good
.
<EOS>
I
prefer
plain
dealing
.
<EOS>
I
am
quite
resigned
to
the
explosion
 
<EOS>
but
I
DO
want
to
get
it
over
,
if
possible
,
before
I
go
to
bed
.
"
  
<EOS>
Here
the
door
opened
,
and
Mrs.
Merridew
uttered
another
little
scream
.
<EOS>
The
advent
of
the
explosion
?
<EOS>
No
:
only
the
advent
of
Betteredge
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
Mr.
Jennings
,
"
said
Betteredge
,
in
his
most
elaborately
confidential
manner
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Franklin
wishes
to
know
where
you
are
.
<EOS>
Being
under
your
orders
to
deceive
him
,
in
respect
to
the
presence
of
my
young
lady
in
the
house
,
I
have
said
I
do
n't
know
.
<EOS>
That
you
will
please
to
observe
,
was
a
lie
.
<EOS>
Having
one
foot
already
in
the
grave
,
sir
,
the
fewer
lies
you
expect
me
to
tell
,
the
more
I
shall
be
indebted
to
you
,
when
my
conscience
pricks
me
and
my
time
comes
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
not
a
moment
to
be
wasted
on
the
purely
speculative
question
of
Betteredge
's
conscience
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Blake
might
make
his
appearance
in
search
of
me
,
unless
I
went
to
him
at
once
in
his
own
room
.
<EOS>
Miss
Verinder
followed
me
out
into
the
corridor
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
seem
to
be
in
a
conspiracy
to
persecute
you
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
What
does
it
mean
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Only
the
protest
of
the
world
,
<EOS>
Miss
Verinder
 
<EOS>
on
a
very
small
scale
 
against
anything
that
is
new
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
are
we
to
do
with
Mrs.
Merridew
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Tell
her
the
explosion
will
take
place
at
nine
to
-
morrow
morning
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
So
as
to
send
her
to
bed
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Yes
 
so
as
to
send
her
to
bed
.
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Verinder
went
back
to
the
sitting
-
room
,
and
I
went
upstairs
to
Mr.
Blake
.
  
<EOS>
To
my
surprise
I
found
him
alone
;
restlessly
pacing
his
room
,
and
a
little
irritated
at
being
left
by
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
Where
is
Mr.
Bruff
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
  
<EOS>
He
pointed
to
the
closed
door
of
communication
between
the
two
rooms
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bruff
had
looked
in
on
him
,
for
a
moment
;
had
attempted
to
renew
his
protest
against
our
proceedings
;
and
had
once
more
failed
to
produce
the
smallest
impression
on
Mr.
Blake
.
<EOS>
Upon
this
,
the
lawyer
had
taken
refuge
in
a
black
leather
bag
,
filled
to
bursting
with
professional
papers
.
<EOS>
"
The
serious
business
of
life
,
"
he
admitted
,
"
was
sadly
out
of
place
on
such
an
occasion
as
the
present
.
<EOS>
But
the
serious
business
of
life
must
be
carried
on
,
for
all
that
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Blake
would
perhaps
kindly
make
allowance
for
the
old
-
fashioned
habits
of
a
practical
man
.
<EOS>
Time
was
money
 
and
,
as
for
Mr.
Jennings
,
he
might
depend
on
it
that
Mr.
Bruff
would
be
forthcoming
when
called
upon
.
<EOS>
"
With
that
apology
,
the
lawyer
had
gone
back
to
his
own
room
,
and
had
immersed
himself
obstinately
in
his
black
bag
.
  
<EOS>
I
thought
of
Mrs.
Merridew
and
her
embroidery
,
and
of
Betteredge
and
his
conscience
.
<EOS>
There
is
a
wonderful
sameness
in
the
solid
side
of
the
English
character
 
just
as
there
is
a
wonderful
sameness
in
the
solid
expression
of
the
English
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
When
are
you
going
to
give
me
the
laudanum
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Mr.
Blake
impatiently
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
wait
a
little
longer
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
stay
and
keep
you
company
till
the
time
comes
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
then
not
ten
o'clock
.
<EOS>
Inquiries
which
I
had
made
,
at
various
times
,
of
Betteredge
and
Mr.
Blake
,
had
led
me
to
the
conclusion
that
the
dose
of
laudanum
given
by
Mr.
Candy
could
not
possibly
have
been
administered
before
eleven
.
<EOS>
I
had
accordingly
determined
not
to
try
the
second
dose
until
that
time
.
  
<EOS>
We
talked
a
little
;
but
both
our
minds
were
preoccupied
by
the
coming
ordeal
.
<EOS>
The
conversation
soon
flagged
 
then
dropped
altogether
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Blake
idly
turned
over
the
books
on
his
bedroom
table
.
<EOS>
I
had
taken
the
precaution
of
looking
at
them
,
when
we
first
entered
the
room
.

my

point

possessing
the
one
great
merit
of
enchaining
nobody
's
interest
,
and
exciting
nobody
's
brain
.
<EOS>
I
left
Mr.
Blake
to
the
composing
influence
of
Standard
Literature
,
and
occupied
myself
in
making
this
entry
in
my
journal
.
  
<EOS>
My
watch
informs
me
that
it
is
close
on
eleven
o'clock
.
<EOS>
I
must
shut
up
these
leaves
once
more
.
     
<EOS>
Two
o'clock
A.M.
 
<EOS>
The
experiment
has
been
tried
.
<EOS>
With
what
result
,
I
am
now
to
describe
.
  
<EOS>
At
eleven
o'clock
,
I
rang
the
bell
for
Betteredge
,
and
told
Mr.
Blake
that
he
might
at
last
prepare
himself
for
bed
.
  
<EOS>
I
looked
out
of
the
window
at
the
night
.
<EOS>
It
was
mild
and
rainy
,
resembling
,
in
this
respect
,
the
night
of
the
birthday
 
<EOS>
the
twenty
-
first
of
June
,
last
year
.
<EOS>
Without
professing
to
believe
in
omens
,
it
was
at
least
encouraging
to
find
no
direct
nervous
influences
 
no
stormy
or
electric
perturbations
 
in
the
atmosphere
.
<EOS>
Betteredge
joined
me
at
the
window
,
and
mysteriously
put
a
little
slip
of
paper
into
my
hand
.
<EOS>
It
contained
these
lines
:
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Merridew
has
gone
to
bed
,
on
the
distinct
understanding
that
the
explosion
is
to
take
place
at
nine
to
-
morrow
morning
,
and
that
I
am
not
to
stir
out
of
this
part
of
the
house
until
she
comes
and
sets
me
free
.
<EOS>
She
has
no
idea
that
the
chief
scene
of
the
experiment
is
my
sitting
-
room
 
<EOS>
or
she
would
have
remained
in
it
for
the
whole
night
!
<EOS>
I
am
alone
,
and
very
anxious
.
<EOS>
Pray
let
me
see
you
measure
out
the
laudanum
;
I
want
to
have
something
to
do
with
it
,
even
in
the
unimportant
character
of
a
mere
looker
-
on
.
 
<EOS>
R.V.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
followed
Betteredge
out
of
the
room
,
and
told
him
to
remove
the
medicine
-
chest
into
Miss
Verinder
's
sitting
-
room
.
  
<EOS>
The
order
appeared
to
take
him
completely
by
surprise
.
<EOS>
He
looked
as
if
he
suspected
me
of
some
occult
medical
design
on
Miss
Verinder
!
<EOS>
"
Might
I
presume
to
ask
,
"
he
said
,
"
what
my
young
lady
and
the
medicine
-
chest
have
got
to
do
with
each
other
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Stay
in
the
sitting
-
room
,
and
you
will
see
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Betteredge
appeared
to
doubt
his
own
unaided
capacity
to
superintend
me
effectually
,
on
an
occasion
when
a
medicine
-
chest
was
included
in
the
proceedings
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
there
any
objection
,
sir
"
he
asked
,
"
to
taking
Mr.
Bruff
into
this
part
of
the
business
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Quite
the
contrary
!
<EOS>
I
am
now
going
to
ask
Mr.
Bruff
to
accompany
me
down
-
stairs
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Betteredge
withdrew
to
fetch
the
medicine
-
chest
,
without
another
word
.
<EOS>
I
went
back
into
Mr.
Blake
's
room
,
and
knocked
at
the
door
of
communication
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bruff
opened
it
,
with
his
papers
in
his
hand
 
immersed
in
Law
;
impenetrable
to
Medicine
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
to
disturb
you
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
am
going
to
prepare
the
laudanum
for
Mr.
Blake
;
and
I
must
request
you
to
be
present
,
and
to
see
what
I
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
?
"
said
Mr.
Bruff
,
with
nine
-
tenths
of
his
attention
riveted
on
his
papers
,
and
with
one
-
tenth
unwillingly
accorded
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Anything
else
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
trouble
you
to
return
here
with
me
,
and
to
see
me
administer
the
dose
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Anything
else
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
One
thing
more
.
<EOS>
I
must
put
you
to
the
inconvenience
of
remaining
in
Mr.
Blake
's
room
,
and
of
waiting
to
see
what
happens
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
very
good
!
"
said
Mr.
Bruff
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
room
,
or
Mr.
Blake
's
room
 
it
does
n't
matter
which
;
I
can
go
on
with
my
papers
anywhere
.
<EOS>
Unless
you
object
,
Mr.
Jennings
,
to
my
importing
THAT
amount
of
common
sense
into
the
proceedings
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Before
I
could
answer
,
Mr.
Blake
addressed
himself
to
the
lawyer
,
speaking
from
his
bed
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
really
mean
to
say
that
you
do
n't
feel
any
interest
in
what
we
are
going
to
do
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Bruff
,
you
have
no
more
imagination
than
a
cow
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
cow
is
a
very
useful
animal
,
Mr.
Blake
,
"
said
the
lawyer
.
<EOS>
With
that
reply
he
followed
me
out
of
the
room
,
still
keeping
his
papers
in
his
hand
.
  
<EOS>
We
found
Miss
Verinder
,
pale
and
agitated
,
restlessly
pacing
her
sitting
-
room
from
end
to
end
.
<EOS>
At
a
table
in
a
corner
stood
Betteredge
,
on
guard
over
the
medicine
-
chest
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bruff
sat
down
on
the
first
chair
that
he
could
find
,
and
(
emulating
the
usefulness
of
the
cow
)
plunged
back
again
into
his
papers
on
the
spot
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Verinder
drew
me
aside
,
and
reverted
instantly
to
her
one
all
-
absorbing
interest
 
her
interest
in
Mr.
Blake
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
is
he
now
?
"
<EOS>
she
asked
.
<EOS>
"
Is
he
nervous
?
<EOS>
is
he
out
of
temper
?
<EOS>
Do
you
think
it
will
succeed
?
<EOS>
Are
you
sure
it
will
do
no
harm
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Quite
sure
.
<EOS>
Come
,
and
see
me
measure
it
out
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
One
moment
!
<EOS>
It
is
past
eleven
now
.
<EOS>
How
long
will
it
be
before
anything
happens
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
easy
to
say
.
<EOS>
An
hour
perhaps
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
the
room
must
be
dark
,
as
it
was
last
year
?
"
  
"
Certainly
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
wait
in
my
bedroom
 
just
as
I
did
before
.
<EOS>
I
shall
keep
the
door
a
little
way
open
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
little
way
open
last
year
.
<EOS>
I
will
watch
the
sitting
-
room
door
;
and
the
moment
it
moves
,
I
will
blow
out
my
light
.
<EOS>
It
all
happened
in
that
way
,
on
my
birthday
night
.
<EOS>
And
it
must
all
happen
again
in
the
same
way
,
<EOS>
musn't
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
sure
you
can
control
yourself
,
Miss
Verinder
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
In
HIS
interests
,
I
can
do
anything
!
"
<EOS>
she
answered
fervently
.
  
<EOS>
One
look
at
her
face
told
me
that
I
could
trust
her
.
<EOS>
I
addressed
myself
again
to
Mr.
Bruff
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
trouble
you
to
put
your
papers
aside
for
a
moment
,
"
I
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
certainly
!
"
He
got
up
with
a
start
 
as
if
I
had
disturbed
him
at
a
particularly
interesting
place
 
and
followed
me
to
the
medicine
-
chest
.
<EOS>
There
,
deprived
of
the
breathless
excitement
incidental
to
the
practice
of
his
profession
,
he
looked
at
Betteredge
 
and
yawned
wearily
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Verinder
joined
me
with
a
glass
jug
of
cold
water
,
which
she
had
taken
from
a
side
-
table
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Let
me
pour
out
the
water
,
"
she
whispered
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
have
a
hand
in
it
!
"
  
<EOS>
I
measured
out
the
forty
minims
from
the
bottle
,
and
poured
the
laudanum
into
a
medicine
glass
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Fill
it
till
it
is
three
parts
full
,
"
I
said
,
and
handed
the
glass
to
Miss
Verinder
.
<EOS>
I
then
directed
Betteredge
to
lock
up
the
medicine
chest
;
informing
him
that
I
had
done
with
it
now
.
<EOS>
A
look
of
unutterable
relief
overspread
the
old
servant
's
countenance
.
<EOS>
He
had
evidently
suspected
me
of
a
medical
design
on
his
young
lady
!
  
<EOS>
After
adding
the
water
as
I
had
directed
,
Miss
Verinder
seized
a
moment
 
while
Betteredge
was
locking
the
chest
,
and
while
Mr.
Bruff
was
looking
back
to
his
papers
 
and
slyly
kissed
the
rim
of
the
medicine
glass
.
<EOS>
"
When
you
give
it
to
him
,
"
said
the
charming
girl
,
"
give
it
to
him
on
that
side
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
took
the
piece
of
crystal
which
was
to
represent
the
Diamond
from
my
pocket
,
and
gave
it
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
have
a
hand
in
this
,
too
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
put
it
where
you
put
the
Moonstone
last
year
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
led
the
way
to
the
Indian
cabinet
,
and
put
the
mock
Diamond
into
the
drawer
which
the
real
Diamond
had
occupied
on
the
birthday
night
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bruff
witnessed
this
proceeding
,
under
protest
,
as
he
had
witnessed
everything
else
.
<EOS>
But
the
strong
dramatic
interest
which
the
experiment
was
now
assuming
,
proved
(
to
my
great
amusement
)
to
be
too
much
for
Betteredge
's
capacity
of
self
restraint
.
<EOS>
His
hand
trembled
as
he
held
the
candle
,
and
he
whispered
anxiously
,
"
Are
you
sure
,
miss
<EOS>
,
it
's
the
right
drawer
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
led
the
way
out
again
,
with
the
laudanum
and
water
in
my
hand
.
<EOS>
At
the
door
,
I
stopped
to
address
a
last
word
to
Miss
Verinder
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
be
long
in
putting
out
the
lights
,
"
I
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
put
them
out
at
once
,
"
she
answered
.
<EOS>
"
And
I
will
wait
in
my
bedroom
,
with
only
one
candle
alight
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
closed
the
sitting
-
room
door
behind
us
.
<EOS>
Followed
by
Mr.
Bruff
and
Betteredge
,
I
went
back
to
Mr.
Blake
's
room
.
  
<EOS>
We
found
him
moving
restlessly
from
side
to
side
of
the
bed
,
and
wondering
irritably
whether
he
was
to
have
the
laudanum
that
night
.
<EOS>
In
the
presence
of
the
two
witnesses
,
I
gave
him
the
dose
,
and
shook
up
his
pillows
,
and
told
him
to
lie
down
again
quietly
and
wait
.
  
<EOS>
His
bed
,
provided
with
light
chintz
curtains
,
was
placed
,
with
the
head
against
the
wall
of
the
room
,
so
as
to
leave
a
good
open
space
on
either
side
of
it
.
<EOS>
On
one
side
,
I
drew
the
curtains
completely
 
and
in
the
part
of
the
room
thus
screened
from
his
view
,
I
placed
Mr.
Bruff
and
Betteredge
,
to
wait
for
the
result
.
<EOS>
At
the
bottom
of
the
bed
I
half
drew
the
curtains
 
and
placed
my
own
chair
at
a
little
distance
,
so
that
I
might
let
him
see
me
or
not
see
me
,
speak
to
me
or
not
speak
to
me
,
just
as
the
circumstances
might
direct
.
<EOS>
Having
already
been
informed
that
he
always
slept
with
a
light
in
the
room
,
I
placed
one
of
the
two
lighted
candles
on
a
little
table
at
the
head
of
the
bed
,
where
the
glare
of
the
light
would
not
strike
on
his
eyes
.
<EOS>
The
other
candle
I
gave
to
Mr.
Bruff
;
the
light
,
in
this
instance
,
being
subdued
by
the
screen
of
the
chintz
curtains
.
<EOS>
The
window
was
open
at
the
top
,
so
as
to
ventilate
the
room
.
<EOS>
The
rain
fell
softly
,
the
house
was
quiet
.
<EOS>
It
was
twenty
minutes
past
eleven
,
by
my
watch
,
when
the
preparations
were
completed
,
and
I
took
my
place
on
the
chair
set
apart
at
the
bottom
of
the
bed
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Bruff
resumed
his
papers
,
with
every
appearance
of
being
as
deeply
interested
in
them
as
ever
.
<EOS>
But
looking
towards
him
now
,
I
saw
certain
signs
and
tokens
which
told
me
that
the
Law
was
beginning
to
lose
its
hold
on
him
at
last
.
<EOS>
The
suspended
interest
of
the
situation
in
which
we
were
now
placed
was
slowly
asserting
its
influence
even
on
HIS
unimaginative
mind
.
<EOS>
As
for
Betteredge
,
consistency
of
principle
and
dignity
of
conduct
had
become
,
in
his
case
,
mere
empty
words
.
<EOS>
He
forgot
that
I
was
performing
a
conjuring
trick
on
Mr.
Franklin
Blake
;
he
forgot
that
I
had
upset
the
house
from
top
to
bottom
;
he
forgot
that
I
had
not
read
ROBINSON
CRUSOE
since
I
was
a
child
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
For
the
Lord
's
sake
,
sir
,
"
he
whispered
to
me
,
"
tell
us
when
it
will
begin
to
work
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
before
midnight
,
"
I
whispered
back
.
<EOS>
"
Say
nothing
,
and
sit
still
.
"
  
<EOS>
Betteredge
dropped
to
the
lowest
depth
of
familiarity
with
me
,
without
a
struggle
to
save
himself
.
<EOS>
He
answered
by
a
wink
!
  
<EOS>
Looking
next
towards
Mr.
Blake
<EOS>
,
I
found
him
as
restless
as
ever
in
his
bed
;
fretfully
wondering
why
the
influence
of
the
laudanum
had
not
begun
to
assert
itself
yet
.
<EOS>
To
tell
him
,
in
his
present
humour
,
that
the
more
he
fidgeted
and
wondered
,
the
longer
he
would
delay
the
result
for
which
we
were
now
waiting
,
would
have
been
simply
useless
.
<EOS>
The
wiser
course
to
take
was
to
dismiss
the
idea
of
the
opium
from
his
mind
,
by
leading
him
insensibly
to
think
of
something
else
.
  
<EOS>
With
this
view
,
I
encouraged
him
to
talk
to
me
;
contriving
so
to
direct
the
conversation
,
on
my
side
,
as
to
lead
it
back
again
to
the
subject
which
had
engaged
us
earlier
in
the
evening
 
<EOS>
the
subject
of
the
Diamond
.
<EOS>
I
took
care
to
revert
to
those
portions
of
the
story
of
the
Moonstone
,
which
related
to
the
transport
of
it
from
London
to
Yorkshire
;
to
the
risk
which
Mr.
Blake
had
run
in
removing
it
from
the
bank
at
Frizinghall
:
and
to
the
unexpected
appearance
of
the
Indians
at
the
house
,
on
the
evening
of
the
birthday
.
<EOS>
And
I
purposely
assumed
,
in
referring
to
these
events
,
to
have
misunderstood
much
of
what
Mr.
Blake
himself
had
told
me
a
few
hours
since
.
<EOS>
In
this
way
,
I
set
him
talking
on
the
subject
with
which
it
was
now
vitally
important
to
fill
his
mind
 
without
allowing
him
to
suspect
that
I
was
making
him
talk
for
a
purpose
.
<EOS>
Little
by
little
,
he
became
so
interested
in
putting
me
right
that
he
forgot
to
fidget
in
the
bed
.
<EOS>
His
mind
was
far
away
from
the
question
of
the
opium
,
at
the
all
-
important
time
when
his
eyes
first
told
me
that
the
opium
was
beginning
to
lay
its
hold
on
his
brain
.
  
<EOS>
I
looked
at
my
watch
.
<EOS>
It
wanted
five
minutes
to
twelve
,
when
the
premonitory
symptoms
of
the
working
of
the
laudanum
first
showed
themselves
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
At
this
time
,
no
unpractised
eyes
would
have
detected
any
change
in
him
.
<EOS>
But
,
as
the
minutes
of
the
new
morning
wore
away
,
the
swiftly
-
subtle
progress
of
the
influence
began
to
show
itself
more
plainly
.
<EOS>
The
sublime
intoxication
of
opium
gleamed
in
his
eyes
;
the
dew
of
a
stealthy
perspiration
began
to
glisten
on
his
face
.
<EOS>
In
five
minutes
more
,
the
talk
which
he
still
kept
up
with
me
,
failed
in
coherence
.
<EOS>
He
held
steadily
to
the
subject
of
the
Diamond
;
but
he
ceased
to
complete
his
sentences
.
<EOS>
A
little
later
,
the
sentences
dropped
to
single
words
.
<EOS>
Then
,
there
was
an
interval
of
silence
.
<EOS>
Then
,
he
sat
up
in
bed
.
<EOS>
Then
,
still
busy
with
the
subject
of
the
Diamond
,
he
began
to
talk
again
 
not
to
me
,
but
to
himself
.
<EOS>
That
change
told
me
that
the
first
stage
in
the
experiment
was
reached
.
<EOS>
The
stimulant
influence
of
the
opium
had
got
him
.
  
<EOS>
The
time
,
now
,
was
twenty
-
three
minutes
past
twelve
.
<EOS>
The
next
half
hour
,
at
most
,
would
decide
the
question
of
whether
he
would
,
or
would
not
,
get
up
from
his
bed
,
and
leave
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
breathless
interest
of
watching
him
 
in
the
unutterable
triumph
of
seeing
the
first
result
of
the
experiment
declare
itself
in
the
manner
,
and
nearly
at
the
time
,
which
I
had
anticipated
 
I
had
utterly
forgotten
the
two
companions
of
my
night
vigil
.
<EOS>
Looking
towards
them
now
,
I
saw
the
Law
(
as
represented
by
Mr.
Bruff
's
papers
)
lying
unheeded
on
the
floor
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bruff
himself
was
looking
eagerly
through
a
crevice
left
in
the
imperfectly
-
drawn
curtains
of
the
bed
.
<EOS>
And
Betteredge
,
oblivious
of
all
respect
for
social
distinctions
,
was
peeping
over
Mr.
Bruff
's
shoulder
.
  
<EOS>
They
both
started
back
,
on
finding
that
I
was
looking
at
them
,
like
two
boys
caught
out
by
their
schoolmaster
in
a
fault
.
<EOS>
I
signed
to
them
to
take
off
their
boots
quietly
,
as
I
was
taking
off
mine
.
<EOS>
If
Mr.
Blake
gave
us
the
chance
of
following
him
,
it
was
vitally
necessary
to
follow
him
without
noise
.
  
<EOS>
Ten
minutes
passed
 
and
nothing
happened
.
<EOS>
Then
,
he
suddenly
threw
the
bed
-
clothes
off
him
.
<EOS>
He
put
one
leg
out
of
bed
.
<EOS>
He
waited
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
had
never
taken
it
out
of
the
bank
,
"
he
said
to
himself
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
safe
in
the
bank
.
"
  
<EOS>
My
heart
throbbed
fast
;
the
pulses
at
my
temples
beat
furiously
.
<EOS>
The
doubt
about
the
safety
of
the
Diamond
was
,
once
more
,
the
dominant
impression
in
his
brain
!
<EOS>
On
that
one
pivot
,
the
whole
success
of
the
experiment
turned
.
<EOS>
The
prospect
thus
suddenly
opened
before
me
was
too
much
for
my
shattered
nerves
.
<EOS>
I
was
obliged
to
look
away
from
him
 
<EOS>
or
I
should
have
lost
my
self
-
control
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
another
interval
of
silence
.
  
<EOS>
When
I
could
trust
myself
to
look
back
at
him
<EOS>
he
was
out
of
his
bed
,
standing
erect
at
the
side
of
it
.
<EOS>
The
pupils
of
his
eyes
were
now
contracted
;
his
eyeballs
gleamed
in
the
light
of
the
candle
as
he
moved
his
head
slowly
to
and
fro
.
<EOS>
He
was
thinking
;
he
was
doubting
 
he
spoke
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
do
I
know
?
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
The
Indians
may
be
hidden
in
the
house
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
stopped
,
and
walked
slowly
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
He
turned
 
waited
 
came
back
to
the
bed
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
not
even
locked
up
,
"
he
went
on
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
in
the
drawer
of
her
cabinet
.
<EOS>
And
the
drawer
does
n't
lock
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
sat
down
on
the
side
of
the
bed
.
<EOS>
"
Anybody
might
take
it
,
"
he
said
.
  
<EOS>
He
rose
again
restlessly
,
and
reiterated
his
first
words
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
do
I
know
?
<EOS>
The
Indians
may
be
hidden
in
the
house
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
waited
again
.
<EOS>
I
drew
back
behind
the
half
curtain
of
the
bed
.
<EOS>
He
looked
about
the
room
,
with
a
vacant
glitter
in
his
eyes
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
breathless
moment
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
pause
of
some
sort
.
<EOS>
A
pause
in
the
action
of
the
opium
?
<EOS>
a
pause
in
the
action
of
the
brain
?
<EOS>
Who
could
tell
?
<EOS>
Everything
depended
,
now
,
on
what
he
did
next
.
  
<EOS>
He
laid
himself
down
again
on
the
bed
!
  
<EOS>
A
horrible
doubt
crossed
my
mind
.
<EOS>
Was
it
possible
that
the
sedative
action
of
the
opium
was
making
itself
felt
already
?
<EOS>
It
was
not
in
my
experience
that
it
should
do
this
.
<EOS>
But
what
is
experience
,
where
opium
is
concerned
?
<EOS>
There
are
probably
no
two
men
in
existence
on
whom
the
drug
acts
in
exactly
the
same
manner
.
<EOS>
Was
some
constitutional
peculiarity
in
him
,
feeling
the
influence
in
some
new
way
?
<EOS>
Were
we
to
fail
on
the
very
brink
of
success
?
  
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
He
got
up
again
abruptly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
How
the
devil
am
I
to
sleep
,
"
he
said
,
"
with
THIS
on
my
mind
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
looked
at
the
light
,
burning
on
the
table
at
the
head
of
his
bed
.
<EOS>
After
a
moment
,
he
took
the
candle
in
his
hand
.
  
<EOS>
I
blew
out
the
second
candle
,
burning
behind
the
closed
curtains
.
<EOS>
I
drew
back
,
with
Mr.
Bruff
and
Betteredge
,
into
the
farthest
corner
by
the
bed
.
<EOS>
I
signed
to
them
to
be
silent
,
as
if
their
lives
had
depended
on
it
.
  
<EOS>
We
waited
 
seeing
and
hearing
nothing
.
<EOS>
We
waited
,
hidden
from
him
by
the
curtains
.
  
<EOS>
The
light
which
he
was
holding
on
the
other
side
of
us
moved
suddenly
.
<EOS>
The
next
moment
he
passed
us
,
swift
and
noiseless
,
with
the
candle
in
his
hand
.
  
<EOS>
He
opened
the
bedroom
door
,
and
went
out
.
  
<EOS>
We
followed
him
along
the
corridor
.
<EOS>
We
followed
him
down
the
stairs
.
<EOS>
We
followed
him
along
the
second
corridor
.
<EOS>
He
never
looked
back
;
he
never
hesitated
.
  
<EOS>
He
opened
the
sitting
-
room
door
,
and
went
in
,
leaving
it
open
behind
him
.
  
<EOS>
The
door
was
hung
(
like
all
the
other
doors
in
the
house
)
on
large
old
-
fashioned
hinges
.
<EOS>
When
it
was
opened
,
a
crevice
was
opened
between
the
door
and
the
post
.
<EOS>
I
signed
to
my
two
companions
to
look
through
this
,
so
as
to
keep
them
from
showing
themselves
.
<EOS>
I
placed
myself
 
outside
the
door
also
 
on
the
opposite
side
.
<EOS>
A
recess
in
the
wall
was
at
my
left
hand
,
in
which
I
could
instantly
hide
myself
,
if
he
showed
any
signs
of
looking
back
into
the
corridor
.
  
<EOS>
He
advanced
to
the
middle
of
the
room
,
with
the
candle
still
in
his
hand
:
he
looked
about
him
 
but
he
never
looked
back
.
  
<EOS>
I
saw
the
door
of
Miss
Verinder
's
bedroom
,
standing
ajar
.
<EOS>
She
had
put
out
her
light
.
<EOS>
She
controlled
herself
nobly
.
<EOS>
The
dim
white
outline
of
her
summer
dress
was
all
that
I
could
see
.
<EOS>
Nobody
who
had
not
known
it
beforehand
would
have
suspected
that
there
was
a
living
creature
in
the
room
.
<EOS>
She
kept
back
,
in
the
dark
:
not
a
word
,
not
a
movement
escaped
her
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
now
ten
minutes
past
one
.
<EOS>
I
heard
,
through
the
dead
silence
,
the
soft
drip
of
the
rain
and
the
tremulous
passage
of
the
night
air
through
the
trees
.
  
<EOS>
After
waiting
irresolute
,
for
a
minute
or
more
,
in
the
middle
of
the
room
,
he
moved
to
the
corner
near
the
window
,
where
the
Indian
cabinet
stood
.
  
<EOS>
He
put
his
candle
on
the
top
of
the
cabinet
.
<EOS>
He
opened
,
and
shut
,
one
drawer
after
another
,
until
he
came
to
the
drawer
in
which
the
mock
Diamond
was
put
.
<EOS>
He
looked
into
the
drawer
for
a
moment
.
<EOS>
Then
he
took
the
mock
Diamond
out
with
his
right
hand
.
<EOS>
With
the
other
hand
,
he
took
the
candle
from
the
top
of
the
cabinet
.
  
<EOS>
He
walked
back
a
few
steps
towards
the
middle
of
the
room
,
and
stood
still
again
.
  
<EOS>
Thus
far
,
he
had
exactly
repeated
what
he
had
done
on
the
birthday
night
.
<EOS>
Would
his
next
proceeding
be
the
same
as
the
proceeding
of
last
year
?
<EOS>
Would
he
leave
the
room
?
<EOS>
Would
he
go
back
now
,
as
I
believed
he
had
gone
back
then
,
to
his
bed
-
chamber
?
<EOS>
Would
he
show
us
what
he
had
done
with
the
Diamond
,
when
he
had
returned
to
his
own
room
?
  
<EOS>
His
first
action
,
when
he
moved
once
more
,
proved
to
be
an
action
which
he
had
not
performed
,
when
he
was
under
the
influence
of
the
opium
for
the
first
time
.
<EOS>
He
put
the
candle
down
on
a
table
,
and
wandered
on
a
little
towards
the
farther
end
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
sofa
there
.
<EOS>
He
leaned
heavily
on
the
back
of
it
,
with
his
left
hand
 
then
roused
himself
,
and
returned
to
the
middle
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
I
could
now
see
his
eyes
.
<EOS>
They
were
getting
dull
and
heavy
;
the
glitter
in
them
was
fast
dying
out
.
  
<EOS>
The
suspense
of
the
moment
proved
too
much
for
Miss
Verinder
's
self
-
control
.
<EOS>
She
advanced
a
few
steps
 
then
stopped
again
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bruff
and
Betteredge
looked
across
the
open
doorway
at
me
for
the
first
time
.
<EOS>
The
prevision
of
a
coming
disappointment
was
impressing
itself
on
their
minds
as
well
as
on
mine
.
  
<EOS>
Still
,
so
long
as
he
stood
where
he
was
,
there
was
hope
.
<EOS>
We
waited
,
in
unutterable
expectation
,
to
see
what
would
happen
next
.
  
<EOS>
The
next
event
was
decisive
.
<EOS>
He
let
the
mock
Diamond
drop
out
of
his
hand
.
  
<EOS>
It
fell
on
the
floor
,
before
the
doorway
 
plainly
visible
to
him
,
and
to
everyone
.
<EOS>
He
made
no
effort
to
pick
it
up
:
he
looked
down
at
it
vacantly
,
and
,
as
he
looked
,
his
head
sank
on
his
breast
.
<EOS>
He
staggered
 
roused
himself
for
an
instant
 
walked
back
unsteadily
to
the
sofa
 
and
sat
down
on
it
.
<EOS>
He
made
a
last
effort
;
he
tried
to
rise
,
and
sank
back
.
<EOS>
His
head
fell
on
the
sofa
cushions
.
<EOS>
It
was
then
twenty
-
five
minutes
past
one
o'clock
.
<EOS>
Before
I
had
put
my
watch
back
in
my
pocket
,
he
was
asleep
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
all
over
now
.
<EOS>
The
sedative
influence
had
got
him
;
the
experiment
was
at
an
end
.
  
<EOS>
I
entered
the
room
,
telling
Mr.
Bruff
and
Betteredge
that
they
might
follow
me
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
fear
of
disturbing
him
.
<EOS>
We
were
free
to
move
and
speak
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
first
thing
to
settle
,
"
I
said
,
"
is
the
question
of
what
we
are
to
do
with
him
.
<EOS>
He
will
probably
sleep
for
the
next
six
or
seven
hours
,
at
least
.
<EOS>
It
is
some
distance
to
carry
him
back
to
his
own
room
.
<EOS>
When
I
was
younger
,
I
could
have
done
it
alone
.
<EOS>
But
my
health
and
strength
are
not
what
they
were
 
<EOS>
I
am
afraid
I
must
ask
you
to
help
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Before
they
could
answer
,
Miss
Verinder
called
to
me
softly
.
<EOS>
She
met
me
at
the
door
of
her
room
,
with
a
light
shawl
,
and
with
the
counterpane
from
her
own
bed
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
mean
to
watch
him
while
he
sleeps
?
<EOS>
"
she
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
am
not
sure
enough
of
the
action
of
the
opium
in
his
case
to
be
willing
to
leave
him
alone
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
handed
me
the
shawl
and
the
counterpane
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
should
you
disturb
him
?
"
<EOS>
she
whispered
.
<EOS>
"
Make
his
bed
on
the
sofa
.
<EOS>
I
can
shut
my
door
,
and
keep
in
my
room
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
infinitely
the
simplest
and
the
safest
way
of
disposing
of
him
for
the
night
.
<EOS>
I
mentioned
the
suggestion
to
Mr.
Bruff
and
Betteredge
 
who
both
approved
of
my
adopting
it
.
<EOS>
In
five
minutes
I
had
laid
him
comfortably
on
the
sofa
,
and
had
covered
him
lightly
with
the
counterpane
and
the
shawl
.
<EOS>
Miss
Verinder
wished
us
good
night
,
and
closed
the
door
.
<EOS>
At
my
request
,
we
three
then
drew
round
the
table
in
the
middle
of
the
room
,
on
which
the
candle
was
still
burning
,
and
on
which
writing
materials
were
placed
.
  
<EOS>
"
Before
we
separate
,
"
I
began
,
"
I
have
a
word
to
say
about
the
experiment
which
has
been
tried
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
Two
distinct
objects
were
to
be
gained
by
it
.
<EOS>
The
first
of
these
objects
was
to
prove
,
that
Mr.
Blake
entered
this
room
,
and
took
the
Diamond
,
last
year
,
acting
unconsciously
and
irresponsibly
,
under
the
influence
of
opium
.
<EOS>
After
what
you
have
both
seen
,
are
you
both
satisfied
,
so
far
?
"
  
<EOS>
They
answered
me
in
the
affirmative
,
without
a
moment
's
hesitation
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
second
object
,
"
I
went
on
,
"
was
to
discover
what
he
did
with
the
Diamond
,
after
he
was
seen
by
Miss
Verinder
to
leave
her
sitting
-
room
with
the
jewel
in
his
hand
,
on
the
birthday
night
.
<EOS>
The
gaining
of
this
object
depended
,
of
course
,
on
his
still
continuing
exactly
to
repeat
his
proceedings
of
last
year
.
<EOS>
He
has
failed
to
do
that
;
and
the
purpose
of
the
experiment
is
defeated
accordingly
.
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
assert
that
I
am
not
disappointed
at
the
result
 
<EOS>
but
I
can
honestly
say
that
I
am
not
surprised
by
it
.
<EOS>
I
told
Mr.
Blake
from
the
first
,
that
our
complete
success
in
this
matter
depended
on
our
completely
reproducing
in
him
the
physical
and
moral
conditions
of
last
year
 
and
I
warned
him
that
this
was
the
next
thing
to
a
downright
impossibility
.
<EOS>
We
have
only
partially
reproduced
the
conditions
,
and
the
experiment
has
been
only
partially
successful
in
consequence
.
<EOS>
It
is
also
possible
that
I
may
have
administered
too
large
a
dose
of
laudanum
.
<EOS>
But
I
myself
look
upon
the
first
reason
that
I
have
given
,
as
the
true
reason
why
we
have
to
lament
a
failure
,
as
well
as
to
rejoice
over
a
success
.
"
  
<EOS>
After
saying
those
words
,
I
put
the
writing
materials
before
Mr.
Bruff
,
and
asked
him
if
he
had
any
objection
 
before
we
separated
for
the
night
 
to
draw
out
,
and
sign
,
a
plain
statement
of
what
he
had
seen
.
<EOS>
He
at
once
took
the
pen
,
and
produced
the
statement
with
the
fluent
readiness
of
a
practised
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
owe
you
this
,
"
he
said
,
signing
the
paper
,
"
as
some
atonement
for
what
passed
between
us
earlier
in
the
evening
.
<EOS>
I
beg
your
pardon
,
Mr.
Jennings
,
for
having
doubted
you
.
<EOS>
You
have
done
Franklin
Blake
an
inestimable
service
.
<EOS>
In
our
legal
phrase
,
you
have
proved
your
case
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Betteredge
's
apology
was
characteristic
of
the
man
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Jennings
,
"
he
said
,
"
when
you
read
ROBINSON
CRUSOE
again
(
which
I
strongly
recommend
you
to
do
)
,
you
will
find
that
he
never
scruples
to
acknowledge
it
,
when
he
turns
out
to
have
been
in
the
wrong
.
<EOS>
Please
to
consider
me
,
sir
,
as
doing
what
Robinson
Crusoe
did
,
on
the
present
occasion
.
<EOS>
"
With
those
words
he
signed
the
paper
in
his
turn
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Bruff
took
me
aside
,
as
we
rose
from
the
table
.
  
<EOS>
"
One
word
about
the
Diamond
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
Your
theory
is
that
Franklin
Blake
hid
the
Moonstone
in
his
room
.
<EOS>
My
theory
is
,
that
the
Moonstone
is
in
the
possession
of
Mr.
Luker
's
bankers
in
London
.
<EOS>
We
wo
n't
dispute
which
of
us
is
right
.
<EOS>
We
will
only
ask
,
which
of
us
is
in
a
position
to
put
his
theory
to
the
test
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
test
,
in
my
case
,
"
I
answered
,
"
has
been
tried
to
-
night
,
and
has
failed
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
test
,
in
my
case
,
"
rejoined
Mr.
Bruff
,
"
is
still
in
process
of
trial
.
<EOS>
For
the
last
two
days
I
have
had
a
watch
set
for
Mr.
Luker
at
the
bank
;
and
I
shall
cause
that
watch
to
be
continued
until
the
last
day
of
the
month
.
<EOS>
I
know
that
he
must
take
the
Diamond
himself
out
of
his
bankers
'
hands
 
and
I
am
acting
on
the
chance
that
the
person
who
has
pledged
the
Diamond
may
force
him
to
do
this
by
redeeming
the
pledge
.
<EOS>
In
that
case
I
may
be
able
to
lay
my
hand
on
the
person
.
<EOS>
If
I
succeed
,
I
clear
up
the
mystery
,
exactly
at
the
point
where
the
mystery
baffles
us
now
!
<EOS>
Do
you
admit
that
,
so
far
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
admitted
it
readily
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
going
back
to
town
by
the
morning
train
,
"
pursued
the
lawyer
.
<EOS>
"
I
may
hear
,
when
I
return
,
that
a
discovery
has
been
made
 
and
it
may
be
of
the
greatest
importance
that
I
should
have
Franklin
Blake
at
hand
to
appeal
to
,
if
necessary
.
<EOS>
I
intend
to
tell
him
,
as
soon
as
he
wakes
,
that
he
must
return
with
me
to
London
.
<EOS>
After
all
that
has
happened
,
may
I
trust
to
your
influence
to
back
me
?
"
  
"
Certainly
!
"
<EOS>
I
said
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Bruff
shook
hands
with
me
,
and
left
the
room
.
<EOS>
Betteredge
followed
him
out
;
I
went
to
the
sofa
to
look
at
Mr.
Blake
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
moved
since
I
had
laid
him
down
and
made
his
bed
 
<EOS>
he
lay
locked
in
a
deep
and
quiet
sleep
.
  
<EOS>
While
I
was
still
looking
at
him
,
I
heard
the
bedroom
door
softly
opened
.
<EOS>
Once
more
,
Miss
Verinder
appeared
on
the
threshold
,
in
her
pretty
summer
dress
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
me
a
last
favour
?
"
she
whispered
.
<EOS>
"
Let
me
watch
him
with
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
hesitated
 
not
in
the
interests
of
propriety
;
only
in
the
interest
of
her
night
's
rest
.
<EOS>
She
came
close
to
me
,
and
took
my
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
sleep
;
I
ca
n't
even
sit
still
,
in
my
own
room
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Mr.
Jennings
,
if
you
were
me
,
only
think
how
you
would
long
to
sit
and
look
at
him
.
<EOS>
Say
,
yes
!
<EOS>
Do
!
"
  
<EOS>
Is
it
necessary
to
mention
that
I
gave
way
?
<EOS>
Surely
not
!
  
<EOS>
She
drew
a
chair
to
the
foot
of
the
sofa
.
<EOS>
She
looked
at
him
in
a
silent
ecstasy
of
happiness
,
till
the
tears
rose
in
her
eyes
.
<EOS>
She
dried
her
eyes
,
and
said
she
would
fetch
her
work
.
<EOS>
She
fetched
her
work
,
and
never
did
a
single
stitch
of
it
.
<EOS>
It
lay
in
her
lap
 
<EOS>
she
was
not
even
able
to
look
away
from
him
long
enough
to
thread
her
needle
.
<EOS>
I
thought
of
my
own
youth
;
I
thought
of
the
gentle
eyes
which
had
once
looked
love
at
me
.
<EOS>
In
the
heaviness
of
my
heart
I
turned
to
my
Journal
for
relief
,
and
wrote
in
it
what
is
written
here
.
  
<EOS>
So
we
kept
our
watch
together
in
silence
.
<EOS>
One
of
us
absorbed
in
his
writing
;
the
other
absorbed
in
her
love
.
  
<EOS>
Hour
after
hour
he
lay
in
his
deep
sleep
.
<EOS>
The
light
of
the
new
day
grew
and
grew
in
the
room
,
and
still
he
never
moved
.
  
<EOS>
Towards
six
o'clock
,
I
felt
the
warning
which
told
me
that
my
pains
were
coming
back
.
<EOS>
I
was
obliged
to
leave
her
alone
with
him
for
a
little
while
.
<EOS>
I
said
I
would
go
up
-
stairs
,
and
fetch
another
pillow
for
him
out
of
his
room
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
a
long
attack
,
this
time
.
<EOS>
In
a
little
while
I
was
able
to
venture
back
,
and
let
her
see
me
again
.
  
<EOS>
I
found
her
at
the
head
of
the
sofa
,
when
I
returned
.
<EOS>
She
was
just
touching
his
forehead
with
her
lips
.
<EOS>
I
shook
my
head
as
soberly
as
I
could
,
and
pointed
to
her
chair
.
<EOS>
She
looked
back
at
me
with
a
bright
smile
,
and
a
charming
colour
in
her
face
.
<EOS>
"
You
would
have
done
it
,
"
she
whispered
,
"
in
my
place
!
"
     
<EOS>
It
is
just
eight
o'clock
.
<EOS>
He
is
beginning
to
move
for
the
first
time
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Verinder
is
kneeling
by
the
side
of
the
sofa
.
<EOS>
She
has
so
placed
herself
that
when
his
eyes
first
open
,
they
must
open
on
her
face
.
  
<EOS>
Shall
I
leave
them
together
?
  
<EOS>
Yes
!
     
<EOS>
Eleven
o'clock
.
 
<EOS>
The
house
is
empty
again
.
<EOS>
They
have
arranged
it
among
themselves
;
they
have
all
gone
to
London
by
the
ten
o'clock
train
.
<EOS>
My
brief
dream
of
happiness
is
over
.
<EOS>
I
have
awakened
again
to
the
realities
of
my
friendless
and
lonely
life
.
  
<EOS>
I
dare
not
trust
myself
to
write
down
,
the
kind
words
that
have
been
said
to
me
especially
by
Miss
Verinder
and
Mr.
Blake
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
it
is
needless
.
<EOS>
Those
words
will
come
back
to
me
in
my
solitary
hours
,
and
will
help
me
through
what
is
left
of
the
end
of
my
life
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Blake
is
to
write
,
and
tell
me
what
happens
in
London
.
<EOS>
Miss
Verinder
is
to
return
to
Yorkshire
in
the
autumn
(
for
her
marriage
,
no
doubt
)
;
and
I
am
to
take
a
holiday
,
and
be
a
guest
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
Oh
me
<EOS>
,
how
I
felt
,
as
the
grateful
happiness
looked
at
me
out
of
her
eyes
,
and
the
warm
pressure
of
her
hand
said
,
"
This
is
your
doing
!
"
  
<EOS>
My
poor
patients
are
waiting
for
me
.
<EOS>
Back
again
,
this
morning
,
to
the
old
routine
!
<EOS>
Back
again
,
to
-
night
,
to
the
dreadful
alternative
between
the
opium
and
the
pain
!
  
<EOS>
God
be
praised
for
His
mercy
!
<EOS>
I
have
seen
a
little
sunshine
 
<EOS>
I
have
had
a
happy
time

The
Story
Resumed
by
FRANKLIN
BLAKE
   
<EOS>
But
few
words
are
needed
,
on
my
part
,
to
complete
the
narrative
that
has
been
presented
in
the
Journal
of
Ezra
Jennings
.
  
<EOS>
Of
myself
,
I
have
only
to
say
that
I
awoke
on
the
morning
of
the
twenty
-
sixth
,
perfectly
ignorant
of
all
that
I
had
said
and
done
under
the
influence
of
the
opium
 
from
the
time
when
the
drug
first
laid
its
hold
on
me
,
to
the
time
when
I
opened
my
eyes
,
in
Rachel
's
sitting
-
room
.
  
<EOS>
Of
what
happened
after
my
waking
,
I
do
not
feel
called
upon
to
render
an
account
in
detail
.
<EOS>
Confining
myself
merely
to
results
,
I
have
to
report
that
Rachel
and
I
thoroughly
understood
each
other
,
before
a
single
word
of
explanation
had
passed
on
either
side
.
<EOS>
I
decline
to
account
,
and
Rachel
declines
to
account
,
for
the
extraordinary
rapidity
of
our
reconciliation
.
<EOS>
Sir
and
Madam
,
look
back
at
the
time
when
you
were
passionately
attached
to
each
other
 
and
you
will
know
what
happened
,
after
Ezra
Jennings
had
shut
the
door
of
the
sitting
-
room
,
as
well
as
I
know
it
myself
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
,
however
,
no
objection
to
add
,
that
we
should
have
been
certainly
discovered
by
Mrs.
Merridew
,
but
for
Rachel
's
presence
of
mind
.
<EOS>
She
heard
the
sound
of
the
old
lady
's
dress
in
the
corridor
,
and
instantly
ran
out
to
meet
her
;
I
heard
Mrs.
Merridew
say
,
"
What
is
the
matter
?
"
<EOS>
and
I
heard
Rachel
answer
,
"
The
explosion
!
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Merridew
instantly
permitted
herself
to
be
taken
by
the
arm
,
and
led
into
the
garden
,
out
of
the
way
of
the
impending
shock
.
<EOS>
On
her
return
to
the
house
,
she
met
me
in
the
hall
,
and
expressed
herself
as
greatly
struck
by
the
vast
improvement
in
Science
,
since
the
time
when
she
was
a
girl
at
school
.
<EOS>
"
Explosions
,
Mr.
Blake
,
are
infinitely
milder
than
they
were
.
<EOS>
I
assure
you
,
I
barely
heard
Mr.
Jennings
's
explosion
from
the
garden
.
<EOS>
And
no
smell
afterwards
,
that
I
can
detect
,
now
we
have
come
back
to
the
house
!
<EOS>
I
must
really
apologise
to
your
medical
friend
.
<EOS>
It
is
only
due
to
him
to
say
that
he
has
managed
it
beautifully
!
"
  
<EOS>
So
,
after
vanquishing
Betteredge
and
Mr.
Bruff
,
Ezra
Jennings
vanquished
Mrs.
Merridew
herself
.
<EOS>
There
is
a
great
deal
of
undeveloped
liberal
feeling
in
the
world
,
after
all
!
  
<EOS>
At
breakfast
,
Mr.
Bruff
made
no
secret
of
his
reasons
for
wishing
that
I
should
accompany
him
to
London
by
the
morning
train
.
<EOS>
The
watch
kept
at
the
bank
,
and
the
result
which
might
yet
come
of
it
,
appealed
so
irresistibly
to
Rachel
's
curiosity
,
that
she
at
once
decided
(
if
Mrs.
Merridew
had
no
objection
)
on
accompanying
us
back
to
town
 
so
as
to
be
within
reach
of
the
earliest
news
of
our
proceedings
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Merridew
proved
to
be
all
pliability
and
indulgence
,
after
the
truly
considerate
manner
in
which
the
explosion
had
conducted
itself
;
and
Betteredge
was
accordingly
informed
that
we
were
all
four
to
travel
back
together
by
the
morning
train
.
<EOS>
I
fully
expected
that
he
would
have
asked
leave
to
accompany
us
.
<EOS>
But
Rachel
had
wisely
provided
her
faithful
old
servant
with
an
occupation
that
interested
him
.
<EOS>
He
was
charged
with
completing
the
refurnishing
of
the
house
,
and
was
too
full
of
his
domestic
responsibilities
to
feel
the
"
detective
-
fever
"
as
he
might
have
felt
it
under
other
circumstances
.
  
<EOS>
Our
one
subject
of
regret
,
in
going
to
London
,
was
the
necessity
of
parting
,
more
abruptly
than
we
could
have
wished
,
with
Ezra
Jennings
.
<EOS>
It
was
impossible
to
persuade
him
to
accompany
us
.
<EOS>
I
could
only
promise
to
write
to
him
 
and
Rachel
could
only
insist
on
his
coming
to
see
her
when
she
returned
to
Yorkshire
.
<EOS>
There
was
every
prospect
of
our
meeting
again
in
a
few
months
 
and
yet
there
was
something
very
sad
in
seeing
our
best
and
dearest
friend
left
standing
alone
on
the
platform
,
as
the
train
moved
out
of
the
station
.
  
<EOS>
On
our
arrival
in
London
,
Mr.
Bruff
was
accosted
at
the
terminus
by
a
small
boy
,
dressed
in
a
jacket
and
trousers
of
threadbare
black
cloth
,
and
personally
remarkable
in
virtue
of
the
extraordinary
prominence
of
his
eyes
.
<EOS>
They
projected
so
far
,
and
they
rolled
about
so
loosely
,
that
you
wondered
uneasily
why
they
remained
in
their
sockets
.
<EOS>
After
listening
to
the
boy
,
Mr.
Bruff
asked
the
ladies
whether
they
would
excuse
our
accompanying
them
back
to
Portland
Place
.
<EOS>
I
had
barely
time
to
promise
Rachel
that
I
would
return
,
and
tell
her
everything
that
had
happened
,
before
Mr.
Bruff
seized
me
by
the
arm
,
and
hurried
me
into
a
cab
.
<EOS>
The
boy
with
the
ill
-
secured
eyes
took
his
place
on
the
box
by
the
driver
,
and
the
driver
was
directed
to
go
to
Lombard
Street
.
  
<EOS>
"
News
from
the
bank
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
,
as
we
started
.
  
<EOS>
"
News
of
Mr.
Luker
,
"
said
Mr.
Bruff
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
An
hour
ago
,
he
was
seen
to
leave
his
house
at
Lambeth
,
in
a
cab
,
accompanied
by
two
men
,
who
were
recognised
by
my
men
as
police
officers
in
plain
clothes
.
<EOS>
If
Mr.
Luker
's
dread
of
the
Indians
is
at
the
bottom
of
this
precaution
,
the
inference
is
plain
enough
.
<EOS>
He
is
going
to
take
the
Diamond
out
of
the
bank
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
we
are
going
to
the
bank
to
see
what
comes
of
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
 
or
to
hear
what
has
come
of
it
,
if
it
is
all
over
by
this
time
.
<EOS>
Did
you
notice
my
boy
 
on
the
box
,
there
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
noticed
his
eyes
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Bruff
laughed
.
<EOS>
"
They
call
the
poor
little
wretch
"
Gooseberry
"
at
the
office
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
employ
him
to
go
on
errands
 
<EOS>
and
I
only
wish
my
clerks
who
have
nick
-
named
him
<EOS>
were
as
thoroughly
to
be
depended
on
as
he
is
.
<EOS>
Gooseberry
is
one
of
the
sharpest
boys
in
London
,
Mr.
Blake
,
in
spite
of
his
eyes
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
twenty
minutes
to
five
when
we
drew
up
before
the
bank
in
Lombard
Street
.
<EOS>
Gooseberry
looked
longingly
at
his
master
,
as
he
opened
the
cab
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
want
to
come
in
too
?
"
asked
Mr.
Bruff
kindly
.
<EOS>
"
Come
in
then
,
and
keep
at
my
heels
till
further
orders
.
<EOS>
He
's
as
quick
as
lightning
,
"
pursued
Mr.
Bruff
,
addressing
me
in
a
whisper
.
<EOS>
"
Two
words
will
do
with
Gooseberry
,
where
twenty
would
be
wanted
with
another
boy
.
"
  
We
entered
the
bank
.
<EOS>
The
outer
office
 
with
the
long
counter
,
behind
which
the
cashiers
sat
 
was
crowded
with
people
;
all
waiting
their
turn
to
take
money
out
,
or
to
pay
money
in
,
before
the
bank
closed
at
five
o'clock
.
  
<EOS>
Two
men
among
the
crowd
approached
Mr.
Bruff
,
as
soon
as
he
showed
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
asked
the
lawyer
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Have
you
seen
him
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
passed
us
here
half
an
hour
since
,
sir
,
and
went
on
into
the
inner
office
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Has
he
not
come
out
again
yet
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Bruff
turned
to
me
.
"
<EOS>
Let
us
wait
,
"
he
said
.
  
<EOS>
I
looked
round
among
the
people
about
me
for
the
three
Indians
.
<EOS>
Not
a
sign
of
them
was
to
be
seen
anywhere
.
<EOS>
The
only
person
present
with
a
noticeably
dark
complexion
was
a
tall
man
in
a
pilot
coat
,
and
a
round
hat
,
who
looked
like
a
sailor
.
<EOS>
Could
this
be
one
of
them
in
disguise
?
<EOS>
Impossible
!
<EOS>
The
man
was
taller
than
any
of
the
Indians
;
and
his
face
,
where
it
was
not
hidden
by
a
bushy
black
beard
,
was
twice
the
breadth
of
any
of
their
faces
at
least
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
must
have
their
spy
somewhere
,
"
said
Mr.
Bruff
,
looking
at
the
dark
sailor
in
his
turn
.
<EOS>
"
And
he
may
be
the
man
.
"
  
<EOS>
Before
he
could
say
more
,
his
coat
-
tail
was
respectfully
pulled
by
his
attendant
sprite
with
the
gooseberry
eyes
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bruff
looked
where
the
boy
was
looking
.
<EOS>
"
Hush
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
Here
is
Mr.
Luker
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
money
-
lender
came
out
from
the
inner
regions
of
the
bank
,
followed
by
his
two
guardian
policemen
in
plain
clothes
.
  
<EOS>
"
Keep
your
eye
on
him
,
"
whispered
Mr.
Bruff
.
<EOS>
"
If
he
passes
the
Diamond
to
anybody
,
he
will
pass
it
here
.
"
  
<EOS>
Without
noticing
either
of
us
,
Mr.
Luker
slowly
made
his
way
to
the
door
 
now
in
the
thickest
,
now
in
the
thinnest
part
of
the
crowd
.
<EOS>
I
distinctly
saw
his
hand
move
,
as
he
passed
a
short
,
stout
man
,
respectably
dressed
in
a
suit
of
sober
grey
.
<EOS>
The
man
started
a
little
,
and
looked
after
him
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Luker
moved
on
slowly
through
the
crowd
.
<EOS>
At
the
door
his
guard
placed
themselves
on
either
side
of
him
.
<EOS>
They
were
all
three
followed
by
one
of
Mr.
Bruff
's
men
 
<EOS>
and
I
saw
them
no
more
.
  
<EOS>
I
looked
round
at
the
lawyer
,
and
then
looked
significantly
towards
the
man
in
the
suit
of
sober
grey
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
!
"
whispered
Mr.
Bruff
,
"
I
saw
it
too
!
"
<EOS>
He
turned
about
,
in
search
of
his
second
man
.
<EOS>
The
second
man
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
.
<EOS>
He
looked
behind
him
for
his
attendant
sprite
.
<EOS>
Gooseberry
had
disappeared
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
the
devil
does
it
mean
?
"
said
Mr.
Bruff
angrily
.
<EOS>
"
They
have
both
left
us
at
the
very
time
when
we
want
them
most
.
"
  
<EOS>
It
came
to
the
turn
of
the
man
in
the
grey
suit
to
transact
his
business
at
the
counter
.
<EOS>
He
paid
in
a
cheque
 
<EOS>
received
a
receipt
for
it
 
and
turned
to
go
out
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
to
be
done
?
"
asked
Mr.
Bruff
.
<EOS>
"
We
ca
n't
degrade
ourselves
by
following
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
!
<EOS>
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
n't
lose
sight
of
that
man
for
ten
thousand
pounds
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
In
that
case
,
"
rejoined
Mr.
Bruff
,
"
I
would
n't
lose
sight
of
you
,
for
twice
the
money
.
<EOS>
A
nice
occupation
for
a
man
in
my
position
,
"
he
muttered
to
himself
,
as
we
followed
the
stranger
out
of
the
bank
.
"
<EOS>
For
Heaven
's
sake
do
n't
mention
it
.
<EOS>
I
should
be
ruined
if
it
was
known
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
man
in
the
grey
suit
got
into
an
omnibus
,
going
westward
.
<EOS>
We
got
in
after
him
.
<EOS>
There
were
latent
reserves
of
youth
still
left
in
Mr.
Bruff
.
<EOS>
I
assert
it
positively
 
when
he
took
his
seat
in
the
omnibus
,
he
blushed
!
  
<EOS>
The
man
in
the
grey
suit
stopped
the
omnibus
,
and
got
out
in
Oxford
Street
.
<EOS>
We
followed
him
again
.
<EOS>
He
went
into
a
chemist
's
shop
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Bruff
started
.
<EOS>
"
My
chemist
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
afraid
we
have
made
a
mistake
.
"
  
<EOS>
We
entered
the
shop
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bruff
and
the
proprietor
exchanged
a
few
words
in
private
.
<EOS>
The
lawyer
joined
me
again
,
with
a
very
crestfallen
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
greatly
to
our
credit
,
"
he
said
,
as
he
took
my
arm
,
and
led
me
out
 
"
that
's
one
comfort
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
to
our
credit
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Blake
!
<EOS>
you
and
I
are
the
two
worst
amateur
detectives
that
ever
tried
their
hands
at
the
trade
.
<EOS>
The
man
in
the
grey
suit
has
been
thirty
years
in
the
chemist
's
service
.
<EOS>
He
was
sent
to
the
bank
to
pay
money
to
his
master
's
account
 
and
he
knows
no
more
of
the
Moonstone
than
the
babe
unborn
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
asked
what
was
to
be
done
next
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
back
to
my
office
,
"
said
Mr.
Bruff
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Gooseberry
,
and
my
second
man
,
have
evidently
followed
somebody
else
.
<EOS>
Let
us
hope
that
THEY
had
their
eyes
about
them
at
any
rate
!
"
  
<EOS>
When
we
reached
Gray
's
Inn
Square
,
the
second
man
had
arrived
there
before
us
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
waiting
for
more
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
!
"
asked
Mr.
Bruff
.
<EOS>
"
What
's
your
news
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
to
say
,
sir
,
"
replied
the
man
,
"
that
I
have
made
a
mistake
.
<EOS>
I
could
have
taken
my
oath
that
I
saw
Mr.
Luker
pass
something
to
an
elderly
gentleman
,
in
a
light
-
coloured
paletot
.
<EOS>
The
elderly
gentleman
turns
out
,
sir
,
to
be
a
most
respectable
master
iron
-
monger
in
Eastcheap
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Where
is
Gooseberry
?
"
asked
Mr.
Bruff
resignedly
.
  
<EOS>
The
man
stared
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
,
sir
.
<EOS>
I
have
seen
nothing
of
him
since
I
left
the
bank
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Bruff
dismissed
the
man
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
One
of
two
things
,
"
he
said
to
me
.
"
<EOS>
Either
Gooseberry
has
run
away
,
or
he
is
hunting
on
his
own
account
.
<EOS>
What
do
you
say
to
dining
here
,
on
the
chance
that
the
boy
may
come
back
in
an
hour
or
two
?
<EOS>
I
have
got
some
good
wine
in
the
cellar
,
and
we
can
get
a
chop
from
the
coffee
-
house
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
We
dined
at
Mr.
Bruff
's
chambers
.
<EOS>
Before
the
cloth
was
removed
,
"
a
person
"
was
announced
as
wanting
to
speak
to
the
lawyer
.
<EOS>
Was
the
person
Gooseberry
?
<EOS>
No
:
only
the
man
who
had
been
employed
to
follow
Mr.
Luker
when
he
left
the
bank
.
  
<EOS>
The
report
,
in
this
case
,
presented
no
feature
of
the
slightest
interest
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Luker
had
gone
back
to
his
own
house
,
and
had
there
dismissed
his
guard
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
gone
out
again
afterwards
.
<EOS>
Towards
dusk
,
the
shutters
had
been
put
up
,
and
the
doors
had
been
bolted
.
<EOS>
The
street
before
the
house
,
and
the
alley
behind
the
house
,
had
been
carefully
watched
.
<EOS>
No
signs
of
the
Indians
had
been
visible
.
<EOS>
No
person
whatever
had
been
seen
loitering
about
the
premises
.
<EOS>
Having
stated
these
facts
,
the
man
waited
to
know
whether
there
were
any
further
orders
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bruff
dismissed
him
for
the
night
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
think
Mr.
Luker
has
taken
the
Moonstone
home
with
him
?
"
<EOS>
I
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
he
,
"
said
Mr.
Bruff
.
<EOS>
"
He
would
never
have
dismissed
his
two
policemen
,
if
he
had
run
the
risk
of
keeping
the
Diamond
in
his
own
house
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
We
waited
another
half
-
hour
for
the
boy
,
and
waited
in
vain
.
<EOS>
It
was
then
time
for
Mr.
Bruff
to
go
to
Hampstead
,
and
for
me
to
return
to
Rachel
in
Portland
Place
.
<EOS>
I
left
my
card
,
in
charge
of
the
porter
at
the
chambers
,
with
a
line
written
on
it
to
say
that
I
should
be
at
my
lodgings
at
half
past
ten
,
that
night
.
<EOS>
The
card
was
to
be
given
to
the
boy
,
if
the
boy
came
back
.
  
<EOS>
Some
men
have
a
knack
of
keeping
appointments
;
and
other
men
have
a
knack
of
missing
them
.
<EOS>
I
am
one
of
the
other
men
.
<EOS>
Add
to
this
,
that
I
passed
the
evening
at
Portland
Place
,
on
the
same
seat
with
Rachel
,
in
a
room
forty
feet
long
,
with
Mrs.
Merridew
at
the
further
end
of
it
.
<EOS>
Does
anybody
wonder
that
I
got
home
at
half
past
twelve
instead
of
half
past
ten
?
<EOS>
How
thoroughly
heartless
that
person
must
be
!
<EOS>
And
how
earnestly
I
hope
I
may
never
make
that
person
's
acquaintance
!
  
<EOS>
My
servant
handed
me
a
morsel
of
paper
when
he
let
me
in
.
  
<EOS>
I
read
,
in
a
neat
legal
handwriting
,
these
words
 
<EOS>
"
If
you
please
,
sir
,
I
am
getting
sleepy
.
<EOS>
I
will
come
back
to
-
morrow
morning
,
between
nine
and
ten
.
"
<EOS>
Inquiry
proved
that
a
boy
,
with
very
extraordinary
-
looking
eyes
,
had
called
,
and
presented
my
card
and
message
,
had
waited
an
hour
,
had
done
nothing
but
fall
asleep
and
wake
up
again
,
had
written
a
line
for
me
,
and
had
gone
home
 
after
gravely
informing
the
servant
that
"
he
was
fit
for
nothing
unless
he
got
his
night
's
rest
.
"
  
<EOS>
At
nine
,
the
next
morning
,
I
was
ready
for
my
visitor
.
<EOS>
At
half
past
nine
,
I
heard
steps
outside
my
door
.
<EOS>
"
Come
in
,
Gooseberry
!
<EOS>
"
I
called
out
.
"
<EOS>
Thank
you
,
sir
,
"
answered
a
grave
and
melancholy
voice
.
<EOS>
The
door
opened
.
<EOS>
I
started
to
my
feet
,
and
confronted
 
Sergeant
Cuff
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
thought
I
would
look
in
here
,
Mr.
Blake
,
on
the
chance
of
your
being
in
town
,
before
I
wrote
to
Yorkshire
,
"
said
the
Sergeant
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
as
dreary
and
as
lean
as
ever
.
<EOS>
His
eyes
had
not
lost
their
old
trick
(
so
subtly
noticed
in
Betteredge
's
NARRATIVE
)
of
"
looking
as
if
they
expected
something
more
from
you
than
you
were
aware
of
yourself
.
"
<EOS>
But
,
so
far
as
dress
can
alter
a
man
,
the
great
Cuff
was
changed
beyond
all
recognition
.
<EOS>
He
wore
a
broad
-
brimmed
white
hat
,
a
light
shooting
jacket
,
white
trousers
,
and
drab
gaiters
.
<EOS>
He
carried
a
stout
oak
stick
.
<EOS>
His
whole
aim
and
object
seemed
to
be
to
look
as
if
he
had
lived
in
the
country
all
his
life
.
<EOS>
When
I
complimented
him
on
his
Metamorphosis
,
he
declined
to
take
it
as
a
joke
.
<EOS>
He
complained
,
quite
gravely
,
of
the
noises
and
the
smells
of
London
.
<EOS>
I
declare
I
am
far
from
sure
that
he
did
not
speak
with
a
slightly
rustic
accent
!
<EOS>
I
offered
him
breakfast
.
<EOS>
The
innocent
countryman
was
quite
shocked
.
<EOS>
HIS
breakfast
hour
was
half
-
past
six
 
<EOS>
and
HE
went
to
bed
with
the
cocks
and
hens
!
  
<EOS>
"
I
only
got
back
from
Ireland
last
night
,
"
said
the
Sergeant
,
coming
round
to
the
practical
object
of
his
visit
,
in
his
own
impenetrable
manner
.
<EOS>
"
Before
I
went
to
bed
,
I
read
your
letter
,
telling
me
what
has
happened
since
my
inquiry
after
the
Diamond
was
suspended
last
year
.
<EOS>
There
's
only
one
thing
to
be
said
about
the
matter
on
my
side
.
<EOS>
I
completely
mistook
my
case
.
<EOS>
How
any
man
living
was
to
have
seen
things
in
their
true
light
,
in
such
a
situation
as
mine
was
at
the
time
,
I
do
n't
profess
to
know
.
<EOS>
But
that
does
n't
alter
the
facts
as
they
stand
.
<EOS>
I
own
that
I
made
a
mess
of
it
.
<EOS>
Not
the
first
mess
,
Mr.
Blake
,
which
has
distinguished
my
professional
career
!
<EOS>
It
's
only
in
books
that
the
officers
of
the
detective
force
are
superior
to
the
weakness
of
making
a
mistake
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
come
in
the
nick
of
time
to
recover
your
reputation
,
"
I
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
Mr.
Blake
,
"
rejoined
the
Sergeant
.
<EOS>
"
Now
I
have
retired
from
business
,
I
do
n't
care
a
straw
about
my
reputation
.
<EOS>
I
have
done
with
my
reputation
,
thank
God
!
<EOS>
I
am
here
,
sir
,
in
grateful
remembrance
of
the
late
Lady
Verinder
's
liberality
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
will
go
back
to
my
old
work
 
if
you
want
me
,
and
if
you
will
trust
me
 
on
that
consideration
,
and
on
no
other
.
<EOS>
Not
a
farthing
of
money
is
to
pass
,
if
you
please
,
from
you
to
me
.
<EOS>
This
is
on
honour
.
<EOS>
Now
tell
me
,
Mr.
Blake
,
how
the
case
stands
since
you
wrote
to
me
last
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
told
him
of
the
experiment
with
the
opium
,
and
of
what
had
occurred
afterwards
at
the
bank
in
Lombard
Street
.
<EOS>
He
was
greatly
struck
by
the
experiment
 
<EOS>
it
was
something
entirely
new
in
his
experience
.
<EOS>
And
he
was
particularly
interested
in
the
theory
of
Ezra
Jennings
,
relating
to
what
I
had
done
with
the
Diamond
,
after
I
had
left
Rachel
's
sitting
-
room
,
on
the
birthday
night
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
hold
with
Mr.
Jennings
that
you
hid
the
Moonstone
,
"
said
Sergeant
Cuff
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
agree
with
him
,
that
you
must
certainly
have
taken
it
back
to
your
own
room
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
?
"
I
asked
.
"
<EOS>
And
what
happened
then
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Have
you
no
suspicion
yourself
of
what
happened
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
None
whatever
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Has
Mr.
Bruff
no
suspicion
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
more
than
I
have
.
"
  
<EOS>
Sergeant
Cuff
rose
,
and
went
to
my
writing
-
table
.
<EOS>
He
came
back
with
a
sealed
envelope
.
<EOS>
It
was
marked
"
Private
;
"
it
was
addressed
to
me
;
and
it
had
the
Sergeant
's
signature
in
the
corner
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suspected
the
wrong
person
,
last
year
,
"
he
said
:
"
and
I
may
be
suspecting
the
wrong
person
now
.
<EOS>
Wait
to
open
the
envelope
,
Mr.
Blake
,
till
you
have
got
at
the
truth
.
<EOS>
And
then
compare
the
name
of
the
guilty
person
,
with
the
name
that
I
have
written
in
that
sealed
letter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
put
the
letter
into
my
pocket
 
and
then
asked
for
the
Sergeant
's
opinion
of
the
measures
which
we
had
taken
at
the
bank
.
  
<EOS>
"
Very
well
intended
,
sir
,
"
he
answered
,
"
and
quite
the
right
thing
to
do
.
<EOS>
But
there
was
another
person
who
ought
to
have
been
looked
after
besides
Mr.
Luker
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
person
named
in
the
letter
you
have
just
given
to
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Mr.
Blake
,
the
person
named
in
the
letter
.
<EOS>
It
ca
n't
be
helped
now
.
<EOS>
I
shall
have
something
to
propose
to
you
and
Mr.
Bruff
,
sir
,
when
the
time
comes
.
<EOS>
Let
's
wait
,
first
,
and
see
if
the
boy
has
anything
to
tell
us
that
is
worth
hearing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
close
on
ten
o'clock
,
and
the
boy
had
not
made
his
appearance
.
<EOS>
Sergeant
Cuff
talked
of
other
matters
.
<EOS>
He
asked
after
his
old
friend
Betteredge
,
and
his
old
enemy
the
gardener
.
<EOS>
In
a
minute
more
,
he
would
no
doubt
have
got
from
this
,
to
the
subject
of
his
favourite
roses
,
if
my
servant
had
not
interrupted
us
by
announcing
that
the
boy
was
below
.
  
<EOS>
On
being
brought
into
the
room
,
Gooseberry
stopped
at
the
threshold
of
the
door
,
and
looked
distrustfully
at
the
stranger
who
was
in
my
company
.
<EOS>
I
told
the
boy
to
come
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
may
speak
before
this
gentleman
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
He
is
here
to
assist
me
;
and
he
knows
all
that
has
happened
.
<EOS>
Sergeant
Cuff
,
"
I
added
,
"
this
is
the
boy
from
Mr.
Bruff
's
office
.
"
  
<EOS>
In
our
modern
system
of
civilisation
,
celebrity
(
no
matter
of
what
kind
)
is
the
lever
that
will
move
anything
.
<EOS>
The
fame
of
the
great
Cuff
had
even
reached
the
ears
of
the
small
Gooseberry
.
<EOS>
The
boy
's
ill
-
fixed
eyes
rolled
,
when
I
mentioned
the
illustrious
name
,
till
I
thought
they
really
must
have
dropped
on
the
carpet
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
here
,
my
lad
,
"
said
the
Sergeant
,
"
and
let
's
hear
what
you
have
got
to
tell
us
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
notice
of
the
great
man
 
the
hero
of
many
a
famous
story
in
every
lawyer
's
office
in
London
 
appeared
to
fascinate
the
boy
.
<EOS>
He
placed
himself
in
front
of
Sergeant
Cuff
,
and
put
his
hands
behind
him
,
after
the
approved
fashion
of
a
neophyte
who
is
examined
in
his
catechism
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
your
name
?
"
said
the
Sergeant
,
beginning
with
the
first
question
in
the
catechism
.
  
<EOS>
"
Octavius
Guy
,
"
answered
the
boy
.
<EOS>
"
They
call
me
Gooseberry
at
the
office
because
of
my
eyes
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Octavius
Guy
,
otherwise
Gooseberry
,
"
pursued
the
Sergeant
,
with
the
utmost
gravity
,
"
you
were
missed
at
the
bank
yesterday
.
<EOS>
What
were
you
about
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
please
,
sir
,
I
was
following
a
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Who
was
he
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
tall
man
,
sir
,
with
a
big
black
beard
,
dressed
like
a
sailor
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
remember
the
man
!
"
<EOS>
I
broke
in
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Bruff
and
I
thought
he
was
a
spy
employed
by
the
Indians
.
"
  
<EOS>
Sergeant
Cuff
did
not
appear
to
be
much
impressed
by
what
Mr.
Bruff
and
I
had
thought
.
<EOS>
He
went
on
catechising
Gooseberry
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
?
"
he
said
 
"
and
why
did
you
follow
the
sailor
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
please
,
sir
,
Mr.
Bruff
wanted
to
know
whether
Mr.
Luker
passed
anything
to
anybody
on
his
way
out
of
the
bank
.
<EOS>
I
saw
Mr.
Luker
pass
something
to
the
sailor
with
the
black
beard
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
did
n't
you
tell
Mr.
Bruff
what
you
saw
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
had
n't
time
to
tell
anybody
,
sir
,
the
sailor
went
out
in
such
a
hurry
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
ran
out
after
him
 
eh
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Gooseberry
,
"
said
the
Sergeant
,
patting
his
head
,
"
you
have
got
something
in
that
small
skull
of
yours
 
<EOS>
and
it
is
n't
cotton
-
wool
.
<EOS>
I
am
greatly
pleased
with
you
,
so
far
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
boy
blushed
with
pleasure
.
<EOS>
Sergeant
Cuff
went
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
?
<EOS>
and
what
did
the
sailor
do
,
when
he
got
into
the
street
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
called
a
cab
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
did
you
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Held
on
behind
,
and
run
after
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Before
the
Sergeant
could
put
his
next
question
,
another
visitor
was
announced
 
<EOS>
the
head
clerk
from
Mr.
Bruff
's
office
.
  
<EOS>
Feeling
the
importance
of
not
interrupting
Sergeant
Cuff
's
examination
of
the
boy
,
I
received
the
clerk
in
another
room
.
<EOS>
He
came
with
bad
news
of
his
employer
.
<EOS>
The
agitation
and
excitement
of
the
last
two
days
had
proved
too
much
for
Mr.
Bruff
.
<EOS>
He
had
awoke
that
morning
with
an
attack
of
gout
;
he
was
confined
to
his
room
at
Hampstead
;
and
,
in
the
present
critical
condition
of
our
affairs
,
he
was
very
uneasy
at
being
compelled
to
leave
me
without
the
advice
and
assistance
of
an
experienced
person
.
<EOS>
The
chief
clerk
had
received
orders
to
hold
himself
at
my
disposal
,
and
was
willing
to
do
his
best
to
replace
Mr.
Bruff
.
  
<EOS>
I
wrote
at
once
to
quiet
the
old
gentleman
's
mind
,
by
telling
him
of
Sergeant
Cuff
's
visit
:
adding
that
Gooseberry
was
at
that
moment
under
examination
;
and
promising
to
inform
Mr.
Bruff
,
either
personally
,
or
by
letter
,
of
whatever
might
occur
later
in
the
day
.
<EOS>
Having
despatched
the
clerk
to
Hampstead
with
my
note
,
I
returned
to
the
room
which
I
had
left
,
and
found
Sergeant
Cuff
at
the
fireplace
,
in
the
act
of
ringing
the
bell
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
Mr.
Blake
,
"
said
the
Sergeant
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
just
going
to
send
word
by
your
servant
that
I
wanted
to
speak
to
you
.
<EOS>
There
is
n't
a
doubt
on
my
mind
that
this
boy
 
<EOS>
this
most
meritorious
boy
,
"
added
the
Sergeant
,
patting
Gooseberry
on
the
head
,
"
has
followed
the
right
man
.
<EOS>
Precious
time
has
been
lost
,
sir
,
through
your
unfortunately
not
being
at
home
at
half
past
ten
last
night
.
<EOS>
The
only
thing
to
do
,
now
,
is
to
send
for
a
cab
immediately
.
"
  
<EOS>
In
five
minutes
more
,
Sergeant
Cuff
and
I
(
with
Gooseberry
on
the
box
to
guide
the
driver
)
were
on
our
way
eastward
,
towards
the
City
.
  
<EOS>
"
One
of
these
days
,
"
said
the
Sergeant
,
pointing
through
the
front
window
of
the
cab
,
"
that
boy
will
do
great
things
in
my
late
profession
.
<EOS>
He
is
the
brightest
and
cleverest
little
chap
I
have
met
with
,
for
many
a
long
year
past
.
<EOS>
You
shall
hear
the
substance
,
Mr.
Blake
,
of
what
he
told
me
while
you
were
out
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
You
were
present
,
I
think
,
when
he
mentioned
that
he
held
on
behind
the
cab
,
and
ran
after
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
sir
,
the
cab
went
from
Lombard
Street
to
the
Tower
Wharf
.
<EOS>
The
sailor
with
the
black
beard
got
out
,
and
spoke
to
the
steward
of
the
Rotterdam
steamboat
,
which
was
to
start
next
morning
.
<EOS>
He
asked
if
he
could
be
allowed
to
go
on
board
at
once
,
and
sleep
in
his
berth
over
-
night
.
<EOS>
The
steward
said
,
No
.
<EOS>
The
cabins
,
and
berths
,
and
bedding
were
all
to
have
a
thorough
cleaning
that
evening
,
and
no
passenger
could
be
allowed
to
come
on
board
,
before
the
morning
.
<EOS>
The
sailor
turned
round
,
and
left
the
wharf
.
<EOS>
When
he
got
into
the
street
again
,
the
boy
noticed
for
the
first
time
,
a
man
dressed
like
a
respectable
mechanic
,
walking
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
road
,
and
apparently
keeping
the
sailor
in
view
.
<EOS>
The
sailor
stopped
at
an
eating
-
house
in
the
neighbourhood
,
and
went
in
.
<EOS>
The
boy
 
not
being
able
to
make
up
his
mind
,
at
the
moment
 
hung
about
among
some
other
boys
,
staring
at
the
good
things
in
the
eating
-
house
window
.
<EOS>
He
noticed
the
mechanic
waiting
,
as
he
himself
was
waiting
 
but
still
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
.
<EOS>
After
a
minute
,
a
cab
came
by
slowly
,
and
stopped
where
the
mechanic
was
standing
.
<EOS>
The
boy
could
only
see
plainly
one
person
in
the
cab
,
who
leaned
forward
at
the
window
to
speak
to
the
mechanic
.
<EOS>
He
described
that
person
,
Mr.
Blake
,
without
any
prompting
from
me
,
as
having
a
dark
face
,
like
the
face
of
an
Indian
.
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
plain
,
by
this
time
,
that
Mr.
Bruff
and
I
had
made
another
mistake
.
<EOS>
The
sailor
with
the
black
beard
was
clearly
not
a
spy
in
the
service
of
the
Indian
conspiracy
.
<EOS>
Was
he
,
by
any
possibility
,
the
man
who
had
got
the
Diamond
?
  
<EOS>
"
After
a
little
,
"
pursued
the
Sergeant
,
"
the
cab
moved
on
slowly
down
the
street
.
<EOS>
The
mechanic
crossed
the
road
,
and
went
into
the
eating
-
house
.
<EOS>
The
boy
waited
outside
till
he
was
hungry
and
tired
 
and
then
went
into
the
eating
-
house
,
in
his
turn
.
<EOS>
He
had
a
shilling
in
his
pocket
;
and
he
dined
sumptuously
,
he
tells
me
,
on
a
black
-
pudding
,
an
eel
-
pie
,
and
a
bottle
of
ginger
-
beer
.
<EOS>
What
can
a
boy
not
digest
?
<EOS>
The
substance
in
question
has
never
been
found
yet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
did
he
see
in
the
eating
-
house
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Mr.
Blake
,
he
saw
the
sailor
reading
the
newspaper
at
one
table
,
and
the
mechanic
reading
the
newspaper
at
another
.
<EOS>
It
was
dusk
before
the
sailor
got
up
,
and
left
the
place
.
<EOS>
He
looked
about
him
suspiciously
when
he
got
out
into
the
street
.
<EOS>
The
boy
 
BEING
a
boy
 
passed
unnoticed
.
<EOS>
The
mechanic
had
not
come
out
yet
.
<EOS>
The
sailor
walked
on
,
looking
about
him
,
and
apparently
not
very
certain
of
where
he
was
going
next
.
<EOS>
The
mechanic
appeared
once
more
,
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
road
.
<EOS>
The
sailor
went
on
,
till
he
got
to
Shore
Lane
,
leading
into
Lower
Thames
Street
.
<EOS>
There
he
stopped
before
a
public
-
house
,
under
the
sign
of
"
The
Wheel
of
Fortune
,
"
and
,
after
examining
the
place
outside
,
went
in
.
<EOS>
Gooseberry
went
in
too
.
<EOS>
There
were
a
great
many
people
,
mostly
of
the
decent
sort
,
at
the
bar
.
"
<EOS>
The
Wheel
of
Fortune
"
is
a
very
respectable
house
,
Mr.
Blake
;
famous
for
its
porter
and
pork
-
pies
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
Sergeant
's
digressions
irritated
me
.
<EOS>
He
saw
it
;
and
confined
himself
more
strictly
to
Gooseberry
's
evidence
when
he
went
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
sailor
,
"
he
resumed
,
"
asked
if
he
could
have
a
bed
.
<EOS>
The
landlord
said
"
No
;
they
were
full
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
barmaid
corrected
him
,
and
said
"
Number
Ten
was
empty
.
"
<EOS>
A
waiter
was
sent
for
to
show
the
sailor
to
Number
Ten
.
<EOS>
Just
before
that
,
Gooseberry
had
noticed
the
mechanic
among
the
people
at
the
bar
.
<EOS>
Before
the
waiter
had
answered
the
call
,
the
mechanic
had
vanished
.
<EOS>
The
sailor
was
taken
off
to
his
room
.
<EOS>
Not
knowing
what
to
do
next
,
Gooseberry
had
the
wisdom
to
wait
and
see
if
anything
happened
.
<EOS>
Something
did
happen
.
<EOS>
The
landlord
was
called
for
.
<EOS>
Angry
voices
were
heard
up
-
stairs
.
<EOS>
The
mechanic
suddenly
made
his
appearance
again
,
collared
by
the
landlord
,
and
exhibiting
,
to
Gooseberry
's
great
surprise
,
all
the
signs
and
tokens
of
being
drunk
.
<EOS>
The
landlord
thrust
him
out
at
the
door
,
and
threatened
him
with
the
police
if
he
came
back
.
<EOS>
From
the
altercation
between
them
,
while
this
was
going
on
,
it
appeared
that
the
man
had
been
discovered
in
Number
Ten
,
and
had
declared
with
drunken
obstinacy
that
he
had
taken
the
room
.
<EOS>
Gooseberry
was
so
struck
by
this
sudden
intoxication
of
a
previously
sober
person
,
that
he
could
n't
resist
running
out
after
the
mechanic
into
the
street
.
<EOS>
As
long
as
he
was
in
sight
of
the
public
-
house
,
the
man
reeled
about
in
the
most
disgraceful
manner
.
<EOS>
The
moment
he
turned
the
corner
of
the
street
,
he
recovered
his
balance
instantly
,
and
became
as
sober
a
member
of
society
as
you
could
wish
to
see
.
<EOS>
Gooseberry
went
back
to
"
The
Wheel
of
Fortune
"
in
a
very
bewildered
state
of
mind
.
<EOS>
He
waited
about
again
,
on
the
chance
of
something
happening
.
<EOS>
Nothing
happened
;
and
nothing
more
was
to
be
heard
,
or
seen
,
of
the
sailor
.
<EOS>
Gooseberry
decided
on
going
back
to
the
office
.
<EOS>
Just
as
he
came
to
this
conclusion
,
who
should
appear
,
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
as
usual
,
but
the
mechanic
again
!
<EOS>
He
looked
up
at
one
particular
window
at
the
top
of
the
public
-
house
,
which
was
the
only
one
that
had
a
light
in
it
.
<EOS>
The
light
seemed
to
relieve
his
mind
.
<EOS>
He
left
the
place
directly
.
<EOS>
The
boy
made
his
way
back
to
Gray
's
Inn
 
<EOS>
got
your
card
and
message
 
called
 
and
failed
to
find
you
.
<EOS>
There
you
have
the
state
of
the
case
,
Mr.
Blake
,
as
it
stands
at
the
present
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
your
own
opinion
of
the
case
,
Sergeant
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
's
serious
,
sir
.
<EOS>
Judging
by
what
the
boy
saw
,
the
Indians
are
in
it
,
to
begin
with
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
And
the
sailor
is
evidently
the
person
to
whom
Mr.
Luker
passed
the
Diamond
.
<EOS>
It
seems
odd
that
Mr.
Bruff
,
and
I
,
and
the
man
in
Mr.
Bruff
's
employment
,
should
all
have
been
mistaken
about
who
the
person
was
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
Not
at
all
,
Mr.
Blake
.
<EOS>
Considering
the
risk
that
person
ran
,
it
's
likely
enough
that
Mr.
Luker
purposely
misled
you
,
by
previous
arrangement
between
them
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
understand
the
proceedings
at
the
public
-
house
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
<EOS>
"
The
man
dressed
like
a
mechanic
was
acting
of
course
in
the
employment
of
the
Indians
.
<EOS>
But
I
am
as
much
puzzled
to
account
for
his
sudden
assumption
of
drunkenness
as
Gooseberry
himself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
can
give
a
guess
at
what
it
means
,
sir
,
"
said
the
Sergeant
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
will
reflect
,
you
will
see
that
the
man
must
have
had
some
pretty
strict
instructions
from
the
Indians
.
<EOS>
They
were
far
too
noticeable
themselves
to
risk
being
seen
at
the
bank
,
or
in
the
public
-
house
 
they
were
obliged
to
trust
everything
to
their
deputy
.
<EOS>
Very
good
.
<EOS>
Their
deputy
hears
a
certain
number
named
in
the
public
-
house
,
as
the
number
of
the
room
which
the
sailor
is
to
have
for
the
night
 
that
being
also
the
room
(
unless
our
notion
is
all
wrong
)
which
the
Diamond
is
to
have
for
the
night
,
too
.
<EOS>
Under
those
circumstances
,
the
Indians
,
you
may
rely
on
it
,
would
insist
on
having
a
description
of
the
room
 
of
its
position
in
the
house
,
of
its
capability
of
being
approached
from
the
outside
,
and
so
on
.
<EOS>
What
was
the
man
to
do
,
with
such
orders
as
these
?
<EOS>
Just
what
he
did
!
<EOS>
He
ran
up
-
stairs
to
get
a
look
at
the
room
,
before
the
sailor
was
taken
into
it
.
<EOS>
He
was
found
there
,
making
his
observations
 
<EOS>
and
he
shammed
drunk
,
as
the
easiest
way
of
getting
out
of
the
difficulty
.
<EOS>
That
's
how
I
read
the
riddle
.
<EOS>
After
he
was
turned
out
of
the
public
-
house
,
he
probably
went
with
his
report
to
the
place
where
his
employers
were
waiting
for
him
.
<EOS>
And
his
employers
,
no
doubt
,
sent
him
back
to
make
sure
that
the
sailor
was
really
settled
at
the
public
-
house
till
the
next
morning
.
<EOS>
As
for
what
happened
at
"
The
Wheel
of
Fortune
,
"
after
the
boy
left
 
we
ought
to
have
discovered
that
last
night
.
<EOS>
It
's
eleven
in
the
morning
,
now
.
<EOS>
We
must
hope
for
the
best
,
and
find
out
what
we
can
.
"
  
<EOS>
In
a
quarter
of
an
hour
more
,
the
cab
stopped
in
Shore
Lane
,
and
Gooseberry
opened
the
door
for
us
to
get
out
.
  
<EOS>
"
All
right
?
"
asked
the
Sergeant
.
  
<EOS>
"
All
right
,
"
answered
the
boy
.
  
<EOS>
The
moment
we
entered
"
The
Wheel
of
Fortune
"
it
was
plain
even
to
my
inexperienced
eyes
that
there
was
something
wrong
in
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
The
only
person
behind
the
counter
at
which
the
liquors
were
served
,
was
a
bewildered
servant
girl
,
perfectly
ignorant
of
the
business
.
<EOS>
One
or
two
customers
,
waiting
for
their
morning
drink
,
were
tapping
impatiently
on
the
counter
with
their
money
.
<EOS>
The
bar
-
maid
appeared
from
the
inner
regions
of
the
parlour
,
excited
and
preoccupied
.
<EOS>
She
answered
Sergeant
Cuff
's
inquiry
for
the
landlord
,
by
telling
him
sharply
that
her
master
was
up
-
stairs
,
and
was
not
to
be
bothered
by
anybody
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
along
with
me
,
sir
,
"
said
Sergeant
Cuff
,
coolly
leading
the
way
up
-
stairs
,
and
beckoning
to
the
boy
to
follow
him
.
  
<EOS>
The
barmaid
called
to
her
master
,
and
warned
him
that
strangers
were
intruding
themselves
into
the
house
.
<EOS>
On
the
first
floor
we
were
encountered
by
the
Landlord
,
hurrying
down
,
in
a
highly
irritated
state
,
to
see
what
was
the
matter
.
  
<EOS>
"
Who
the
devil
are
you
?
<EOS>
and
what
do
you
want
here
?
<EOS>
"
he
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
Keep
your
temper
,
"
said
the
Sergeant
,
quietly
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
tell
you
who
I
am
to
begin
with
.
<EOS>
I
am
Sergeant
Cuff
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
illustrious
name
instantly
produced
its
effect
.
<EOS>
The
angry
landlord
threw
open
the
door
of
a
sitting
-
room
,
and
asked
the
Sergeant
's
pardon
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
annoyed
and
out
of
sorts
,
sir
 
<EOS>
that
's
the
truth
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
Something
unpleasant
has
happened
in
the
house
this
morning
.
<EOS>
A
man
in
my
way
of
business
has
a
deal
to
upset
his
temper
,
Sergeant
Cuff
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Not
a
doubt
of
it
,
"
said
the
Sergeant
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
come
at
once
,
if
you
will
allow
me
,
to
what
brings
us
here
.
<EOS>
This
gentleman
and
I
want
to
trouble
you
with
a
few
inquiries
,
on
a
matter
of
some
interest
to
both
of
us
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
Relating
to
what
,
sir
?
"
asked
the
landlord
.
  
<EOS>
"
Relating
to
a
dark
man
,
dressed
like
a
sailor
,
who
slept
here
last
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Good
God
!
<EOS>
that
's
the
man
who
is
upsetting
the
whole
house
at
this
moment
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
landlord
.
<EOS>
"
Do
you
,
or
does
this
gentleman
know
anything
about
him
?
"
  
"
We
ca
n't
be
certain
till
we
see
him
,
"
answered
the
Sergeant
.
  
<EOS>
"
See
him
?
"
echoed
the
landlord
.
<EOS>
"
That
's
the
one
thing
that
nobody
has
been
able
to
do
since
seven
o'clock
this
morning
.
<EOS>
That
was
the
time
when
he
left
word
,
last
night
,
that
he
was
to
be
called
.
<EOS>
He
WAS
called
 
and
there
was
no
getting
an
answer
from
him
,
and
no
opening
his
door
to
see
what
was
the
matter
.
<EOS>
They
tried
again
at
eight
,
and
they
tried
again
at
nine
.
<EOS>
No
use
!
<EOS>
There
was
the
door
still
locked
 
and
not
a
sound
to
be
heard
in
the
room
!
<EOS>
I
have
been
out
this
morning
 
<EOS>
and
I
only
got
back
a
quarter
of
an
hour
ago
.
<EOS>
I
have
hammered
at
the
door
myself
 
and
all
to
no
purpose
.
<EOS>
The
potboy
has
gone
to
fetch
a
carpenter
.
<EOS>
If
you
can
wait
a
few
minutes
,
gentlemen
,
we
will
have
the
door
opened
,
and
see
what
it
means
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Was
the
man
drunk
last
night
?
"
asked
Sergeant
Cuff
.
  
<EOS>
"
Perfectly
sober
,
sir
 
or
I
would
never
have
let
him
sleep
in
my
house
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
he
pay
for
his
bed
beforehand
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Could
he
leave
the
room
in
any
way
,
without
going
out
by
the
door
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
room
is
a
garret
,
"
said
the
landlord
.
<EOS>
"
But
there
's
a
trap
-
door
in
the
ceiling
,
leading
out
on
to
the
roof
 
and
a
little
lower
down
the
street
,
there
's
an
empty
house
under
repair
.
<EOS>
Do
you
think
,
Sergeant
,
the
blackguard
has
got
off
in
that
way
,
without
paying
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
sailor
,
"
said
Sergeant
Cuff
,
"
might
have
done
it
 
early
in
the
morning
,
before
the
street
was
astir
.
<EOS>
He
would
be
used
to
climbing
,
and
his
head
would
n't
fail
him
on
the
roofs
of
the
houses
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
As
he
spoke
,
the
arrival
of
the
carpenter
was
announced
.
<EOS>
We
all
went
up
-
stairs
,
at
once
,
to
the
top
story
.
<EOS>
I
noticed
that
the
Sergeant
was
unusually
grave
,
even
for
him
.
<EOS>
It
also
struck
me
as
odd
that
he
told
the
boy
(
after
having
previously
encouraged
him
to
follow
us
)
,
to
wait
in
the
room
below
till
we
came
down
again
.
  
<EOS>
The
carpenter
's
hammer
and
chisel
disposed
of
the
resistance
of
the
door
in
a
few
minutes
.
<EOS>
But
some
article
of
furniture
had
been
placed
against
it
inside
,
as
a
barricade
.
<EOS>
By
pushing
at
the
door
,
we
thrust
this
obstacle
aside
,
and
so
got
admission
to
the
room
.
<EOS>
The
landlord
entered
first
;
the
Sergeant
second
;
and
I
third
.
<EOS>
The
other
persons
present
followed
us
.
  
<EOS>
We
all
looked
towards
the
bed
,
and
all
started
.
  
<EOS>
The
man
had
not
left
the
room
.
<EOS>
He
lay
,
dressed
,
on
the
bed
 
with
a
white
pillow
over
his
face
,
which
completely
hid
it
from
view
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
does
that
mean
?
<EOS>
"
said
the
landlord
,
pointing
to
the
pillow
.
  
<EOS>
Sergeant
Cuff
led
the
way
to
the
bed
,
without
answering
,
and
removed
the
pillow
.
  
<EOS>
The
man
's
swarthy
face
was
placid
and
still
;
his
black
hair
and
beard
were
slightly
,
very
slightly
,
discomposed
.
<EOS>
His
eyes
stared
wide
-
open
,
glassy
and
vacant
,
at
the
ceiling
.
<EOS>
The
filmy
look
and
the
fixed
expression
of
them
horrified
me
.
<EOS>
I
turned
away
,
and
went
to
the
open
window
.
<EOS>
The
rest
of
them
remained
,
where
Sergeant
Cuff
remained
,
at
the
bed
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
's
in
a
fit
!
<EOS>
"
I
heard
the
landlord
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
's
dead
,
"
the
Sergeant
answered
.
<EOS>
"
Send
for
the
nearest
doctor
,
and
send
for
the
police
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
waiter
was
despatched
on
both
errands
.
<EOS>
Some
strange
fascination
seemed
to
hold
Sergeant
Cuff
to
the
bed
.
<EOS>
Some
strange
curiosity
seemed
to
keep
the
rest
of
them
waiting
,
to
see
what
the
Sergeant
would
do
next
.
  
<EOS>
I
turned
again
to
the
window
.
<EOS>
The
moment
afterwards
,
I
felt
a
soft
pull
at
my
coat
-
tails
,
and
a
small
voice
whispered
,
"
<EOS>
Look
here
,
sir
!
"
  
<EOS>
Gooseberry
had
followed
us
into
the
room
.
<EOS>
His
loose
eyes
rolled
frightfully
 
not
in
terror
,
but
in
exultation
.
<EOS>
He
had
made
a
detective
-
discovery
on
his
own
account
.
<EOS>
"
Look
here
,
sir
,
"
he
repeated
 
and
led
me
to
a
table
in
the
corner
of
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
table
stood
a
little
wooden
box
,
open
,
and
empty
.
<EOS>
On
one
side
of
the
box
lay
some
jewellers
'
cotton
.
<EOS>
On
the
other
side
,
was
a
torn
sheet
of
white
paper
,
with
a
seal
on
it
,
partly
destroyed
,
and
with
an
inscription
in
writing
,
which
was
still
perfectly
legible
.
<EOS>
The
inscription
was
in
these
words
:
  
"
Deposited
with
Messrs.
Bushe
,
Lysaught
,
and
Bushe
,
by
Mr.
Septimus
Luker
,
of
Middlesex
Place
,
Lambeth
,
a
small
wooden
box
,
sealed
up
in
this
envelope
,
and
containing
a
valuable
of
great
price
.
<EOS>
The
box
,
when
claimed
,
to
be
only
given
up
by
Messrs.
Bushe
and
Co.
on
the
personal
application
of
Mr.
Luker
.
"
  
<EOS>
Those
lines
removed
all
further
doubt
,
on
one
point
at
least
.
<EOS>
The
sailor
had
been
in
possession
of
the
Moonstone
,
when
he
had
left
the
bank
on
the
previous
day
.
  
<EOS>
I
felt
another
pull
at
my
coat
-
tails
.
<EOS>
Gooseberry
had
not
done
with
me
yet
.
  
<EOS>
"
Robbery
!
"
whispered
the
boy
,
pointing
,
in
high
delight
,
to
the
empty
box
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
were
told
to
wait
down
-
stairs
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
Go
away
!
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
Murder
!
"
<EOS>
added
Gooseberry
,
pointing
,
with
a
keener
relish
still
,
to
the
man
on
the
bed
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
something
so
hideous
in
the
boy
's
enjoyment
of
the
horror
of
the
scene
,
that
I
took
him
by
the
two
shoulders
and
put
him
out
of
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
At
the
moment
when
I
crossed
the
threshold
of
the
door
,
I
heard
Sergeant
Cuff
's
voice
,
asking
where
I
was
.
<EOS>
He
met
me
,
as
I
returned
into
the
room
,
and
forced
me
to
go
back
with
him
to
the
bedside
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Blake
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
Look
at
the
man
's
face
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
face
disguised
 
<EOS>
and
here
's
a
proof
of
it
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
traced
with
his
finger
a
thin
line
of
livid
white
,
running
backward
from
the
dead
man
's
forehead
,
between
the
swarthy
complexion
,
and
the
slightly
-
disturbed
black
hair
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Let
's
see
what
is
under
this
,
"
said
the
Sergeant
,
suddenly
seizing
the
black
hair
,
with
a
firm
grip
of
his
hand
.
  
<EOS>
My
nerves
were
not
strong
enough
to
bear
it
.
<EOS>
I
turned
away
again
from
the
bed
.
  
<EOS>
The
first
sight
that
met
my
eyes
,
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
,
was
the
irrepressible
Gooseberry
,
perched
on
a
chair
,
and
looking
with
breathless
interest
,
over
the
heads
of
his
elders
,
at
the
Sergeant
's
proceedings
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
's
pulling
off
his
wig
!
"
<EOS>
whispered
Gooseberry
,
compassionating
my
position
,
as
the
only
person
in
the
room
who
could
see
nothing
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
pause
 
<EOS>
and
then
a
cry
of
astonishment
among
the
people
round
the
bed
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
's
pulled
off
his
beard
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Gooseberry
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
another
pause
 
Sergeant
Cuff
asked
for
something
.
<EOS>
The
landlord
went
to
the
wash
-
hand
-
stand
,
and
returned
to
the
bed
with
a
basin
of
water
and
a
towel
.
  
<EOS>
Gooseberry
danced
with
excitement
on
the
chair
.
<EOS>
"
Come
up
here
,
along
with
me
,
sir
!
<EOS>
He
's
washing
off
his
complexion
now
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
Sergeant
suddenly
burst
his
way
through
the
people
about
him
,
and
came
,
with
horror
in
his
face
,
straight
to
the
place
where
I
was
standing
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
back
to
the
bed
,
sir
!
"
<EOS>
he
began
.
<EOS>
He
looked
at
me
closer
,
and
checked
himself
"
<EOS>
No
!
"
<EOS>
he
resumed
.
<EOS>
"
Open
the
sealed
letter
first
 
the
letter
I
gave
you
this
morning
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
opened
the
letter
.
  
<EOS>
"
Read
the
name
,
Mr.
Blake
,
that
I
have
written
inside
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
read
the
name
that
he
had
written
.
<EOS>
It
was
GODFREY
ABLEWHITE
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
"
said
the
Sergeant
,
"
come
with
me
,
and
look
at
the
man
on
the
bed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
went
with
him
,
and
looked
at
the
man
on
the
bed
.
  
<EOS>
GODFREY
ABLEWHITE
!

To
Franklin
Blake
,
Esq
.
<EOS>
Sir
,
 
I
beg
to
apologise
for
the
delay
that
has
occurred
in
the
production
of
the
Report
,
with
which
I
engaged
to
furnish
you
.
<EOS>
I
have
waited
to
make
it
a
complete
Report
;
and
I
have
been
met
,
here
and
there
,
by
obstacles
which
it
was
only
possible
to
remove
by
some
little
expenditure
of
patience
and
time
.
  
<EOS>
The
object
which
I
proposed
to
myself
has
now
,
I
hope
,
been
attained
.
<EOS>
You
will
find
,
in
these
pages
,
answers
to
the
greater
part
 
if
not
all
 
of
the
questions
,
concerning
the
late
Mr.
Godfrey
Ablewhite
,
which
occurred
to
your
mind
when
I
last
had
the
honour
of
seeing
you
.
  
<EOS>
I
propose
to
tell
you
 
in
the
first
place
 
what
is
known
of
the
manner
in
which
your
cousin
met
his
death
;
appending
to
the
statement
such
inferences
and
conclusions
as
we
are
justified
(
according
to
my
opinion
)
in
drawing
from
the
facts
.
  
<EOS>
I
shall
then
endeavour
 
in
the
second
place
 
to
put
you
in
possession
of
such
discoveries
as
I
have
made
,
respecting
the
proceedings
of
Mr.
Godfrey
Ablewhite
,
before
,
during
and
after
the
time
,
when
you
and
he
met
as
guests
at
the
late
Lady
Verinder
's
country
-
house
.

<EOS>
As
to
your
cousin
's
death
,
then
,
first
.
  
<EOS>
It
appears
to
be
established
,
beyond
any
reasonable
doubt
,
that
he
was
killed
(
while
he
was
asleep
,
or
immediately
on
his
waking
)
by
being
smothered
with
a
pillow
from
his
bed
 
that
the
persons
guilty
of
murdering
him
are
the
three
Indians
 
and
that
the
object
contemplated
(
and
achieved
)
by
the
crime
,
was
to
obtain
possession
of
the
diamond
,
called
the
Moonstone
.
  
<EOS>
The
facts
from
which
this
conclusion
is
drawn
,
are
derived
partly
from
an
examination
of
the
room
at
the
tavern
;
and
partly
from
the
evidence
obtained
at
the
Coroner
's
Inquest
.
  
<EOS>
On
forcing
the
door
of
the
room
,
the
deceased
gentleman
was
discovered
,
dead
,
with
the
pillow
of
the
bed
over
his
face
.
<EOS>
The
medical
man
who
examined
him
,
being
informed
of
this
circumstance
,
considered
the
post
-
mortem
appearances
as
being
perfectly
compatible
with
murder
by
smothering
 
that
is
to
say
,
with
murder
committed
by
some
person
,
or
persons
,
pressing
the
pillow
over
the
nose
and
mouth
of
the
deceased
,
until
death
resulted
from
congestion
of
the
lungs
.
  
<EOS>
Next
,
as
to
the
motive
for
the
crime
.
  
<EOS>
A
small
box
,
with
a
sealed
paper
torn
off
from
it
(
the
paper
containing
an
inscription
)
was
found
open
,
and
empty
,
on
a
table
in
the
room
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Luker
has
himself
personally
identified
the
box
,
the
seal
,
and
the
inscription
.
<EOS>
He
has
declared
that
the
box
did
actually
contain
the
diamond
,
called
the
Moonstone
;
and
he
has
admitted
having
given
the
box
(
thus
sealed
up
)
to
Mr.
Godfrey
Ablewhite
(
then
concealed
under
a
disguise
)
,
on
the
afternoon
of
the
twenty
-
sixth
of
June
last
.
<EOS>
The
fair
inference
from
all
this
is
,
that
the
stealing
of
the
Moonstone
was
the
motive
of
the
crime
.
  
<EOS>
Next
,
as
to
the
manner
in
which
the
crime
was
committed
.
  
<EOS>
On
examination
of
the
room
(
which
is
only
seven
feet
high
)
,
a
trap
-
door
in
the
ceiling
,
leading
out
on
to
the
roof
of
the
house
,
was
discovered
open
.
<EOS>
The
short
ladder
,
used
for
obtaining
access
to
the
trap
-
door
(
and
kept
under
the
bed
)
,
was
found
placed
at
the
opening
,
so
as
to
enable
any
person
or
persons
,
in
the
room
,
to
leave
it
again
easily
.
<EOS>
In
the
trap
-
door
itself
was
found
a
square
aperture
cut
in
the
wood
,
apparently
with
some
exceedingly
sharp
instrument
,
just
behind
the
bolt
which
fastened
the
door
on
the
inner
side
.
<EOS>
In
this
way
,
any
person
from
the
outside
could
have
drawn
back
the
bolt
,
and
opened
the
door
,
and
have
dropped
(
or
have
been
noiselessly
lowered
by
an
accomplice
)
into
the
room
 
its
height
,
as
already
observed
,
being
only
seven
feet
.
<EOS>
That
some
person
,
or
persons
,
must
have
got
admission
in
this
way
,
appears
evident
from
the
fact
of
the
aperture
being
there
.
<EOS>
As
to
the
manner
in
which
he
(
or
they
)
obtained
access
to
the
roof
of
the
tavern
,
it
is
to
be
remarked
that
the
third
house
,
lower
down
in
the
street
,
was
empty
,
and
under
repair
 
that
a
long
ladder
was
left
by
the
workmen
,
leading
from
the
pavement
to
the
top
of
the
house
 
and
that
,
on
returning
to
their
work
,
on
the
morning
of
the
27th
,
the
men
found
the
plank
which
they
had
tied
to
the
ladder
,
to
prevent
anyone
from
using
it
in
their
absence
,
removed
,
and
lying
on
the
ground
.
<EOS>
As
to
the
possibility
of
ascending
by
this
ladder
,
passing
over
the
roofs
of
the
houses
,
passing
back
,
and
descending
again
,
unobserved
 
it
is
discovered
,
on
the
evidence
of
the
night
policeman
,
that
he
only
passes
through
Shore
Lane
twice
in
an
hour
,
when
out
on
his
beat
.
<EOS>
The
testimony
of
the
inhabitants
also
declares
,
that
Shore
Lane
,
after
midnight
,
is
one
of
the
quietest
and
loneliest
streets
in
London
.
<EOS>
Here
again
,
therefore
,
it
seems
fair
to
infer
that
 
with
ordinary
caution
,
and
presence
of
mind
 
<EOS>
any
man
,
or
men
,
might
have
ascended
by
the
ladder
,
and
might
have
descended
again
,
unobserved
.
<EOS>
Once
on
the
roof
of
the
tavern
,
it
has
been
proved
,
by
experiment
,
that
a
man
might
cut
through
the
trap
-
door
,
while
lying
down
on
it
,
and
that
in
such
a
position
,
the
parapet
in
front
of
the
house
would
conceal
him
from
the
view
of
anyone
passing
in
the
street
.
  
<EOS>
Lastly
,
as
to
the
person
,
or
persons
,
by
whom
the
crime
was
committed
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
known
(
1
)
that
the
Indians
had
an
interest
in
possessing
themselves
of
the
Diamond
.
<EOS>
(
2
)
<EOS>
It
is
at
least
probable
that
the
man
looking
like
an
Indian
,
whom
Octavius
Guy
saw
at
the
window
of
the
cab
,
speaking
to
the
man
dressed
like
a
mechanic
,
was
one
of
the
three
Hindoo
conspirators
.
<EOS>
(
3
)
<EOS>
It
is
certain
that
this
same
man
dressed
like
a
mechanic
,
was
seen
keeping
Mr.
Godfrey
Ablewhite
in
view
,
all
through
the
evening
of
the
26th
,
and
was
found
in
the
bedroom
(
before
Mr.
Ablewhite
was
shown
into
it
)
under
circumstances
which
lead
to
the
suspicion
that
he
was
examining
the
room
.
<EOS>
(
4
)
<EOS>
A
morsel
of
torn
gold
thread
was
picked
up
in
the
bedroom
,
which
persons
expert
in
such
matters
,
declare
to
be
of
Indian
manufacture
,
and
to
be
a
species
of
gold
thread
not
known
in
England
.
<EOS>
(
5
)
<EOS>
On
the
morning
of
the
27th
,
three
men
,
answering
to
the
description
of
the
three
Indians
,
were
observed
in
Lower
Thames
Street
,
were
traced
to
the
Tower
Wharf
,
and
were
seen
to
leave
London
by
the
steamer
bound
for
Rotterdam
.
  
<EOS>
There
is
here
,
moral
,
if
not
legal
,
evidence
,
that
the
murder
was
committed
by
the
Indians
.
  
<EOS>
Whether
the
man
personating
a
mechanic
was
,
or
was
not
,
an
accomplice
in
the
crime
,
it
is
impossible
to
say
.
<EOS>
That
he
could
have
committed
the
murder
alone
,
seems
beyond
the
limits
of
probability
.
<EOS>
Acting
by
himself
,
he
could
hardly
have
smothered
Mr.
Ablewhite
 
<EOS>
who
was
the
taller
and
stronger
man
of
the
two
 
without
a
struggle
taking
place
,
or
a
cry
being
heard
.
<EOS>
A
servant
girl
,
sleeping
in
the
next
room
,
heard
nothing
.
<EOS>
The
landlord
,
sleeping
in
the
room
below
,
heard
nothing
.
<EOS>
The
whole
evidence
points
to
the
inference
that
more
than
one
man
was
concerned
in
this
crime
 
and
the
circumstances
<EOS>
,
I
repeat
,
morally
justify
the
conclusion
that
the
Indians
committed
it
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
only
to
add
,
that
the
verdict
at
the
Coroner
's
Inquest
was
Wilful
Murder
against
some
person
,
or
persons
,
unknown
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Ablewhite
's
family
have
offered
a
reward
,
and
no
effort
has
been
left
untried
to
discover
the
guilty
persons
.
<EOS>
The
man
dressed
like
a
mechanic
has
eluded
all
inquiries
.
<EOS>
The
Indians
have
been
traced
.
<EOS>
As
to
the
prospect
of
ultimately
capturing
these
last
,
I
shall
have
a
word
to
say
to
you
on
that
head
,
when
I
reach
the
end
of
the
present
Report
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
meanwhile
,
having
now
written
all
that
is
needful
on
the
subject
of
Mr.
Godfrey
Ablewhite
's
death
,
I
may
pass
next
to
the
narrative
of
his
proceedings
before
,
during
,
and
after
the
time
,
when
you
and
he
met
at
the
late
Lady
Verinder
's
house
.
  
<EOS>
III
  
<EOS>
With
regard
to
the
subject
now
in
hand
,
I
may
state
,
at
the
outset
,
that
Mr.
Godfrey
Ablewhite
's
life
had
two
sides
to
it
.
  
<EOS>
The
side
turned
up
to
the
public
view
,
presented
the
spectacle
of
a
gentleman
,
possessed
of
considerable
reputation
as
a
speaker
at
charitable
meetings
,
and
endowed
with
administrative
abilities
,
which
he
placed
at
the
disposal
of
various
Benevolent
Societies
,
mostly
of
the
female
sort
.
<EOS>
The
side
kept
hidden
from
the
general
notice
,
exhibited
this
same
gentleman
in
the
totally
different
character
of
a
man
of
pleasure
,
with
a
villa
in
the
suburbs
which
was
not
taken
in
his
own
name
,
and
with
a
lady
in
the
villa
,
who
was
not
taken
in
his
own
name
,
either
.
  
<EOS>
My
investigations
in
the
villa
have
shown
me
several
fine
pictures
and
statues
;
furniture
tastefully
selected
,
and
admirably
made
;
and
a
conservatory
of
the
rarest
flowers
,
the
match
of
which
it
would
not
be
easy
to
find
in
all
London
.
<EOS>
My
investigation
of
the
lady
has
resulted
in
the
discovery
of
jewels
which
are
worthy
to
take
rank
with
the
flowers
,
and
of
carriages
and
horses
which
have
(
deservedly
)
produced
a
sensation
in
the
Park
,
among
persons
well
qualified
to
judge
of
the
build
of
the
one
,
and
the
breed
of
the
others
.
  
<EOS>
All
this
is
,
so
far
,
common
enough
.
<EOS>
The
villa
and
the
lady
are
such
familiar
objects
in
London
life
,
that
I
ought
to
apologise
for
introducing
them
to
notice
.
<EOS>
But
what
is
not
common
and
not
familiar
(
in
my
experience
)
,
is
that
all
these
fine
things
were
not
only
ordered
,
but
paid
for
.
<EOS>
The
pictures
,
the
statues
,
the
flowers
,
the
jewels
,
the
carriages
,
and
the
horses
 
inquiry
proved
,
to
my
indescribable
astonishment
,
that
not
a
sixpence
of
debt
was
owing
on
any
of
them
.
<EOS>
As
to
the
villa
,
it
had
been
bought
,
out
and
out
,
and
settled
on
the
lady
.
  
<EOS>
I
might
have
tried
to
find
the
right
reading
of
this
riddle
,
and
tried
in
vain
 
but
for
Mr.
Godfrey
Ablewhite
's
death
,
which
caused
an
inquiry
to
be
made
into
the
state
of
his
affairs
.
  
<EOS>
The
inquiry
elicited
these
facts
:
    
That
Mr.
Godfrey
Ablewhite
was
entrusted
with
the
care
of
a
sum
of
twenty
thousand
pounds
 
as
one
of
two
Trustees
for
a
young
gentleman
,
who
was
still
a
minor
in
the
year
eighteen
hundred
and
forty
-
eight
.
<EOS>
That
the
Trust
was
to
lapse
,
and
that
the
young
gentleman
was
to
receive
the
twenty
thousand
pounds
on
the
day
when
he
came
of
age
,
in
the
month
of
February
,
eighteen
hundred
and
fifty
.
<EOS>
That
,
pending
the
arrival
of
this
period
,
an
income
of
six
hundred
pounds
was
to
be
paid
to
him
by
his
two
Trustees
,
half
-
yearly
 
at
Christmas
and
Midsummer
Day
.
<EOS>
That
this
income
was
regularly
paid
by
the
active
Trustee
,
Mr.
Godfrey
Ablewhite
.
<EOS>
That
the
twenty
thousand
pounds
(
from
which
the
income
was
supposed
to
be
derived
)
had
every
farthing
of
it
been
sold
out
of
the
Funds
,
at
different
periods
,
ending
with
the
end
of
the
year
eighteen
hundred
and
forty
-
seven
.
<EOS>
That
the
power
of
attorney
,
authorising
the
bankers
to
sell
out
the
stock
,
and
the
various
written
orders
telling
them
what
amounts
to
sell
out
,
were
formally
signed
by
both
the
Trustees
.
<EOS>
That
the
signature
of
the
second
Trustee
(
a
retired
army
officer
,
living
in
the
country
)
was
a
signature
forged
,
in
every
case
,
by
the
active
Trustee
 
<EOS>
otherwise
Mr.
Godfrey
Ablewhite
.
  
<EOS>
In
these
facts
lies
the
explanation
of
Mr.
Godfrey
's
honourable
conduct
,
in
paying
the
debts
incurred
for
the
lady
and
the
villa
 
<EOS>
and
(
as
you
will
presently
see
)
of
more
besides
.
  
<EOS>
We
may
now
advance
to
the
date
of
Miss
Verinder
's
birthday
(
in
the
year
eighteen
hundred
and
forty
-
eight
)
 
<EOS>
the
twenty
-
first
of
June
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
day
before
,
Mr.
Godfrey
Ablewhite
arrived
at
his
father
's
house
,
and
asked
(
as
I
know
from
Mr.
Ablewhite
,
senior
,
himself
)
for
a
loan
of
three
hundred
pounds
.
<EOS>
Mark
the
sum
;
and
remember
at
the
same
time
,
that
the
half
-
yearly
payment
to
the
young
gentleman
was
due
on
the
twenty
-
fourth
of
the
month
.
<EOS>
Also
,
that
the
whole
of
the
young
gentleman
's
fortune
had
been
spent
by
his
Trustee
,
by
the
end
of
the
year
"
forty
-
seven
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Ablewhite
,
senior
,
refused
to
lend
his
son
a
farthing
.
  
<EOS>
The
next
day
Mr.
Godfrey
Ablewhite
rode
over
,
with
you
,
to
Lady
Verinder
's
house
.
<EOS>
A
few
hours
afterwards
,
Mr.
Godfrey
(
as
you
yourself
have
told
me
)
made
a
proposal
of
marriage
to
Miss
Verinder
.
<EOS>
Here
,
he
saw
his
way
no
doubt
 
if
accepted
 
to
the
end
of
all
his
money
anxieties
,
present
and
future
.
<EOS>
But
,
as
events
actually
turned
out
,
what
happened
?
<EOS>
Miss
Verinder
refused
him
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
night
of
the
birthday
,
therefore
,
Mr.
Godfrey
Ablewhite
's
pecuniary
position
was
this
.
<EOS>
He
had
three
hundred
pounds
to
find
on
the
twenty
-
fourth
of
the
month
,
and
twenty
thousand
pounds
to
find
in
February
eighteen
hundred
and
fifty
.
<EOS>
Failing
to
raise
these
sums
,
at
these
times
,
he
was
a
ruined
man
.
  
<EOS>
Under
those
circumstances
,
what
takes
place
next
?
  
<EOS>
You
exasperate
Mr.
Candy
,
the
doctor
,
on
the
sore
subject
of
his
profession
;
and
he
plays
you
a
practical
joke
,
in
return
,
with
a
dose
of
laudanum
.
<EOS>
He
trusts
the
administration
of
the
dose
,
prepared
in
a
little
phial
,
to
Mr.
Godfrey
Ablewhite
 
<EOS>
who
has
himself
confessed
the
share
he
had
in
the
matter
,
under
circumstances
which
shall
presently
be
related
to
you
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Godfrey
is
all
the
readier
to
enter
into
the
conspiracy
,
having
himself
suffered
from
your
sharp
tongue
in
the
course
of
the
evening
.
<EOS>
He
joins
Betteredge
in
persuading
you
to
drink
a
little
brandy
and
water
before
you
go
to
bed
.
<EOS>
He
privately
drops
the
dose
of
laudanum
into
your
cold
grog
.
<EOS>
And
you
drink
the
mixture
.
  
<EOS>
Let
us
now
shift
the
scene
,
if
you
please
to
Mr.
Luker
's
house
at
Lambeth
.
<EOS>
And
allow
me
to
remark
,
by
way
of
preface
,
that
Mr.
Bruff
and
I
,
together
,
have
found
a
means
of
forcing
the
money
-
lender
to
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
.
<EOS>
We
have
carefully
sifted
the
statement
he
has
addressed
to
us
;
and
here
it
is
at
your
service
.

IV
  
<EOS>
Late
on
the
evening
of
Friday
,
the
twenty
-
third
of
June
(
"
forty
-
eight
)
,
Mr.
Luker
was
surprised
by
a
visit
from
Mr.
Godfrey
Ablewhite
.
<EOS>
He
was
more
than
surprised
,
when
Mr.
Godfrey
produced
the
Moonstone
.
<EOS>
No
such
Diamond
(
according
to
Mr.
Luker
's
experience
)
was
in
the
possession
of
any
private
person
in
Europe
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Godfrey
Ablewhite
had
two
modest
proposals
to
make
,
in
relation
to
this
magnificent
gem
.
<EOS>
First
,
Would
Mr.
Luker
be
so
good
as
to
buy
it
?
<EOS>
Secondly
,
Would
Mr.
Luker
(
in
default
of
seeing
his
way
to
the
purchase
)
undertake
to
sell
it
on
commission
,
and
to
pay
a
sum
down
,
on
the
anticipated
result
?
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Luker
tested
the
Diamond
,
weighed
the
Diamond
and
estimated
the
value
of
the
Diamond
,
before
he
answered
a
word
.
<EOS>
HIS
estimate
(
allowing
for
the
flaw
in
the
stone
)
was
thirty
thousand
pounds
.
  
<EOS>
Having
reached
that
result
,
Mr.
Luker
opened
his
lips
,
and
put
a
question
:
"
How
did
you
come
by
this
?
"
<EOS>
Only
six
words
!
<EOS>
But
what
volumes
of
meaning
in
them
!
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Godfrey
Ablewhite
began
a
story
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Luker
opened
his
lips
again
,
and
only
said
three
words
,
this
time
.
<EOS>
"
That
wo
n't
do
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Godfrey
Ablewhite
began
another
story
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Luker
wasted
no
more
words
on
him
.
<EOS>
He
got
up
,
and
rang
the
bell
for
the
servant
to
show
the
gentleman
out
.
  
<EOS>
Upon
this
compulsion
,
Mr.
Godfrey
made
an
effort
,
and
came
out
with
a
new
and
amended
version
of
the
affair
,
to
the
following
effect
.
  
<EOS>
After
privately
slipping
the
laudanum
into
your
brandy
and
water
,
he
wished
you
good
night
,
and
went
into
his
own
room
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
next
room
to
yours
;
and
the
two
had
a
door
of
communication
between
them
.
<EOS>
On
entering
his
own
room
Mr.
Godfrey
(
as
he
supposed
)
closed
his
door
.
<EOS>
His
money
troubles
kept
him
awake
.
<EOS>
He
sat
,
in
his
dressing
-
gown
and
slippers
,
for
nearly
an
hour
,
thinking
over
his
position
.
<EOS>
Just
as
he
was
preparing
to
get
into
bed
,
he
heard
you
,
talking
to
yourself
,
in
your
own
room
,
and
going
to
the
door
of
communication
,
found
that
he
had
not
shut
it
as
he
supposed
.
  
<EOS>
He
looked
into
your
room
to
see
what
was
the
matter
.
<EOS>
He
discovered
you
with
the
candle
in
your
hand
,
just
leaving
your
bed
-
chamber
.
<EOS>
He
heard
you
say
to
yourself
,
in
a
voice
quite
unlike
your
own
voice
,
"
How
do
I
know
?
<EOS>
The
Indians
may
be
hidden
in
the
house
.
"
  
<EOS>
Up
to
that
time
,
he
had
simply
supposed
himself
(
in
giving
you
the
laudanum
)
to
be
helping
to
make
you
the
victim
of
a
harmless
practical
joke
.
<EOS>
It
now
occurred
to
him
,
that
the
laudanum
had
taken
some
effect
on
you
,
which
had
not
been
foreseen
by
the
doctor
,
any
more
than
by
himself
.
<EOS>
In
the
fear
of
an
accident
happening
he
followed
you
softly
to
see
what
you
would
do
.
  
<EOS>
He
followed
you
to
Miss
Verinder
's
sitting
-
room
,
and
saw
you
go
in
.
<EOS>
You
left
the
door
open
.
<EOS>
He
looked
through
the
crevice
thus
produced
,
between
the
door
and
the
post
,
before
he
ventured
into
the
room
himself
.
  
<EOS>
In
that
position
,
he
not
only
detected
you
in
taking
the
Diamond
out
of
the
drawer
 
he
also
detected
Miss
Verinder
,
silently
watching
you
from
her
bedroom
,
through
her
open
door
.
<EOS>
His
own
eyes
satisfied
him
that
SHE
saw
you
take
the
Diamond
,
too
.
  
<EOS>
Before
you
left
the
sitting
-
room
again
,
you
hesitated
a
little
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Godfrey
took
advantage
of
this
hesitation
to
get
back
again
to
his
bedroom
before
you
came
out
,
and
discovered
him
.
<EOS>
He
had
barely
got
back
,
before
you
got
back
too
.
<EOS>
You
saw
him
(
as
he
supposes
)
just
as
he
was
passing
through
the
door
of
communication
.
<EOS>
At
any
rate
,
you
called
to
him
in
a
strange
,
drowsy
voice
.
  
<EOS>
He
came
back
to
you
.
<EOS>
You
looked
at
him
in
a
dull
sleepy
way
.
<EOS>
You
put
the
Diamond
into
his
hand
.
<EOS>
You
said
to
him
,
"
Take
it
back
,
Godfrey
,
to
your
father
's
bank
.
<EOS>
It
's
safe
there
 
<EOS>
it
's
not
safe
here
.
<EOS>
"
You
turned
away
unsteadily
,
and
put
on
your
dressing
-
gown
.
<EOS>
You
sat
down
in
the
large
arm
-
chair
in
your
room
.
<EOS>
You
said
,
"
I
ca
n't
take
it
back
to
the
bank
.
<EOS>
My
head
's
like
lead
 
<EOS>
and
I
ca
n't
feel
my
feet
under
me
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Your
head
sank
on
the
back
of
the
chair
 
you
heaved
a
heavy
sigh
 
<EOS>
and
you
fell
asleep
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Godfrey
Ablewhite
went
back
,
with
the
Diamond
,
into
his
own
room
.
<EOS>
His
statement
is
,
that
he
came
to
no
conclusion
,
at
that
time
 
except
that
he
would
wait
,
and
see
what
happened
in
the
morning
.
  
<EOS>
When
the
morning
came
,
your
language
and
conduct
showed
that
you
were
absolutely
ignorant
of
what
you
had
said
and
done
overnight
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
,
Miss
Verinder
's
language
and
conduct
showed
that
she
was
resolved
to
say
nothing
(
in
mercy
to
you
)
on
her
side
.
<EOS>
If
Mr.
Godfrey
Ablewhite
chose
to
keep
the
Diamond
,
he
might
do
so
with
perfect
impunity
.
<EOS>
The
Moonstone
stood
between
him
and
ruin
.
<EOS>
He
put
the
Moonstone
into
his
pocket
.
  
<EOS>
V
  
<EOS>
This
was
the
story
told
by
your
cousin
(
under
pressure
of
necessity
)
to
Mr.
Luker
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Luker
believed
the
story
to
be
,
as
to
all
main
essentials
,
true
 
on
this
ground
,
that
Mr.
Godfrey
Ablewhite
was
too
great
a
fool
to
have
invented
it
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bruff
and
I
agree
with
Mr.
Luker
,
in
considering
this
test
of
the
truth
of
the
story
to
be
a
perfectly
reliable
one
.
  
<EOS>
The
next
question
,
was
the
question
of
what
Mr.
Luker
would
do
in
the
matter
of
the
Moonstone
.
<EOS>
He
proposed
the
following
terms
,
as
the
only
terms
on
which
he
would
consent
to
mix
himself
up
with
,
what
was
(
even
in
HIS
line
of
business
)
a
doubtful
and
dangerous
transaction
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Luker
would
consent
to
lend
Mr.
Godfrey
Ablewhite
the
sum
of
two
thousand
pounds
,
on
condition
that
the
Moonstone
was
to
be
deposited
with
him
as
a
pledge
.
<EOS>
If
,
at
the
expiration
of
one
year
from
that
date
,
Mr.
Godfrey
Ablewhite
paid
three
thousand
pounds
to
Mr.
Luker
,
he
was
to
receive
back
the
Diamond
,
as
a
pledge
redeemed
.
<EOS>
If
he
failed
to
produce
the
money
at
the
expiration
of
the
year
,
the
pledge
(
otherwise
the
Moonstone
)
was
to
be
considered
as
forfeited
to
Mr.
Luker
 
<EOS>
who
would
,
in
this
latter
case
,
generously
make
Mr.
Godfrey
a
present
of
certain
promissory
notes
of
his
(
relating
to
former
dealings
)
which
were
then
in
the
money
-
lender
's
possession
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
needless
to
say
,
that
Mr.
Godfrey
indignantly
refused
to
listen
to
these
monstrous
terms
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Luker
thereupon
,
handed
him
back
the
Diamond
,
and
wished
him
good
night
.
  
<EOS>
Your
cousin
went
to
the
door
,
and
came
back
again
.
<EOS>
How
was
he
to
be
sure
that
the
conversation
of
that
evening
would
be
kept
strictly
secret
between
his
friend
and
himself
?
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Luker
did
n't
profess
to
know
how
.
<EOS>
If
Mr.
Godfrey
had
accepted
his
terms
,
Mr.
Godfrey
would
have
made
him
an
accomplice
,
and
might
have
counted
on
his
silence
as
on
a
certainty
.
<EOS>
As
things
were
,
Mr.
Luker
must
be
guided
by
his
own
interests
.
<EOS>
If
awkward
inquiries
were
made
,
how
could
he
be
expected
to
compromise
himself
,
for
the
sake
of
a
man
who
had
declined
to
deal
with
him
?
  
<EOS>
Receiving
this
reply
,
Mr.
Godfrey
Ablewhite
did
,
what
all
animals
(
human
and
otherwise
)
do
,
when
they
find
themselves
caught
in
a
trap
.
<EOS>
He
looked
about
him
in
a
state
of
helpless
despair
.
<EOS>
The
day
of
the
month
,
recorded
on
a
neat
little
card
in
a
box
on
the
money
-
lender
's
chimney
-
piece
,
happened
to
attract
his
eye
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
twenty
-
third
of
June
.
<EOS>
On
the
twenty
-
fourth
he
had
three
hundred
pounds
to
pay
to
the
young
gentleman
for
whom
he
was
trustee
,
and
no
chance
of
raising
the
money
,
except
the
chance
that
Mr.
Luker
had
offered
to
him
.
<EOS>
But
for
this
miserable
obstacle
,
he
might
have
taken
the
Diamond
to
Amsterdam
,
and
have
made
a
marketable
commodity
of
it
,
by
having
it
cut
up
into
separate
stones
.
<EOS>
As
matters
stood
,
he
had
no
choice
but
to
accept
Mr.
Luker
's
terms
.
<EOS>
After
all
,
he
had
a
year
at
his
disposal
,
in
which
to
raise
the
three
thousand
pounds
 
and
a
year
is
a
long
time
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Luker
drew
out
the
necessary
documents
on
the
spot
.
<EOS>
When
they
were
signed
,
he
gave
Mr.
Godfrey
Ablewhite
two
cheques
.
<EOS>
One
,
dated
June
23rd
,
for
three
hundred
pounds
.
<EOS>
Another
,
dated
a
week
on
,
for
the
remaining
balance
seventeen
hundred
pounds
.
  
<EOS>
How
the
Moonstone
was
trusted
to
the
keeping
of
Mr
Luker
's
bankers
,
and
how
the
Indians
treated
Mr.
Luker
and
Mr.
Godfrey
(
after
that
had
been
done
)
<EOS>
you
know
already
.
  
<EOS>
The
next
event
in
your
cousin
's
life
refers
again
to
Miss
Verinder
.
<EOS>
He
proposed
marriage
to
her
for
the
second
time
 
<EOS>
and
(
after
having
being
accepted
)
he
consented
,
at
her
request
,
to
consider
the
marriage
as
broken
off
.
<EOS>
One
of
his
reasons
for
making
this
concession
has
been
penetrated
by
Mr.
Bruff
.
<EOS>
Miss
Verinder
had
only
a
life
interest
in
her
mother
's
property
 
and
there
was
no
raising
the
twenty
thousand
pounds
on
THAT
.
  
<EOS>
But
you
will
say
,
he
might
have
saved
the
three
thousand
pounds
,
to
redeem
the
pledged
Diamond
,
if
he
had
married
.
<EOS>
He
might
have
done
so
certainly
 
supposing
neither
his
wife
,
nor
her
guardians
and
trustees
,
objected
to
his
anticipating
more
than
half
of
the
income
at
his
disposal
,
for
some
unknown
purpose
,
in
the
first
year
of
his
marriage
.
<EOS>
But
even
if
he
got
over
this
obstacle
,
there
was
another
waiting
for
him
in
the
background
.
<EOS>
The
lady
at
the
Villa
,
had
heard
of
his
contemplated
marriage
.
<EOS>
A
superb
woman
,
Mr.
Blake
,
of
the
sort
that
are
not
to
be
trifled
with
 
the
sort
with
the
light
complexion
and
the
Roman
nose
.
<EOS>
She
felt
the
utmost
contempt
for
Mr.
Godfrey
Ablewhite
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
silent
contempt
,
if
he
made
a
handsome
provision
for
her
.
<EOS>
Otherwise
,
it
would
be
contempt
with
a
tongue
to
it
.
<EOS>
Miss
Verinder
's
life
interest
allowed
him
no
more
hope
of
raising
the
"
provision
"
than
of
raising
the
twenty
thousand
pounds
.
<EOS>
He
could
n't
marry
 
he
really
could
n't
marry
,
under
all
the
circumstances
.
  
<EOS>
How
he
tried
his
luck
again
with
another
lady
,
and
how
THAT
marriage
also
broke
down
on
the
question
of
money
,
you
know
already
.
<EOS>
You
also
know
of
the
legacy
of
five
thousand
pounds
,
left
to
him
shortly
afterwards
,
by
one
of
those
many
admirers
among
the
soft
sex
whose
good
graces
this
fascinating
man
had
contrived
to
win
.
<EOS>
That
legacy
(
as
the
event
has
proved
)
led
him
to
his
death
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
ascertained
that
when
he
went
abroad
,
on
getting
his
five
thousand
pounds
,
he
went
to
Amsterdam
.
<EOS>
There
he
made
all
the
necessary
arrangements
for
having
the
Diamond
cut
into
separate
stones
.
<EOS>
He
came
back
(
in
disguise
)
,
and
redeemed
the
Moonstone
,
on
the
appointed
day
.
<EOS>
A
few
days
were
allowed
to
elapse
(
as
a
precaution
agreed
to
by
both
parties
)
before
the
jewel
was
actually
taken
out
of
the
bank
.
<EOS>
If
he
had
got
safe
with
it
to
Amsterdam
,
there
would
have
been
just
time
between
July
"
forty
-
nine
,
and
February
"
fifty
(
when
the
young
gentleman
came
of
age
)
to
cut
the
Diamond
,
and
to
make
a
marketable
commodity
(
polished
or
unpolished
)
of
the
separate
stones
.
<EOS>
Judge
from
this
,
what
motives
he
had
to
run
the
risk
which
he
actually
ran
.
<EOS>
It
was
"
neck
or
nothing
"
with
him
 
if
ever
it
was
"
neck
or
nothing
"
with
a
man
yet
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
only
to
remind
you
,
before
closing
this
Report
,
that
there
is
a
chance
of
laying
hands
on
the
Indians
,
and
of
recovering
the
Moonstone
yet
.
<EOS>
They
are
now
(
there
is
every
reason
to
believe
)
on
their
passage
to
Bombay
,
in
an
East
Indiaman
.
<EOS>
The
ship
(
barring
accidents
)
will
touch
at
no
other
port
on
her
way
out
;
and
the
authorities
at
Bombay
(
already
communicated
with
by
letter
,
overland
)
will
be
prepared
to
board
the
vessel
,
the
moment
she
enters
the
harbour
.

In
a
Letter
from
MR

<EOS>
CANDY
  
<EOS>
Frizinghall
,
Wednesday
,
September
26th
,
1849
.
 
<EOS>
Dear
Mr.
Franklin
Blake
,
you
will
anticipate
the
sad
news
I
have
to
tell
you
,
on
finding
your
letter
to
Ezra
Jennings
<EOS>
returned
to
you
,
unopened
,
in
this
enclosure
.
<EOS>
He
died
in
my
arms
,
at
sunrise
,
on
Wednesday
last
.
  
<EOS>
I
am
not
to
blame
for
having
failed
to
warn
you
that
his
end
was
at
hand
.
<EOS>
He
expressly
forbade
me
to
write
to
you
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
indebted
to
Mr.
Franklin
Blake
,
"
he
said
,
"
for
having
seen
some
happy
days
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
distress
him
,
Mr.
Candy
 
do
n't
distress
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
His
sufferings
,
up
to
the
last
six
hours
of
his
life
,
were
terrible
to
see
.
<EOS>
In
the
intervals
of
remission
,
when
his
mind
was
clear
,
I
entreated
him
to
tell
me
of
any
relatives
of
his
to
whom
I
might
write
.
<EOS>
He
asked
to
be
forgiven
for
refusing
anything
to
me
.
<EOS>
And
then
he
said
 
not
bitterly
 
that
he
would
die
as
he
had
lived
,
forgotten
and
unknown
.
<EOS>
He
maintained
that
resolution
to
the
last
.
<EOS>
There
is
no
hope
now
of
making
any
discoveries
concerning
him
.
<EOS>
His
story
is
a
blank
.
  
<EOS>
The
day
before
he
died
,
he
told
me
where
to
find
all
his
papers
.
<EOS>
I
brought
them
to
him
on
his
bed
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
little
bundle
of
old
letters
which
he
put
aside
.
<EOS>
There
was
his
unfinished
book
.
<EOS>
There
was
his
Diary
 
in
many
locked
volumes
.
<EOS>
He
opened
the
volume
for
this
year
,
and
tore
out
,
one
by
one
,
the
pages
relating
to
the
time
when
you
and
he
were
together
.
"
<EOS>
Give
those
,
"
he
said
,
"
to
Mr.
Franklin
Blake
.
<EOS>
In
years
to
come
,
he
may
feel
an
interest
in
looking
back
at
what
is
written
there
.
"
<EOS>
Then
he
clasped
his
hands
,
and
prayed
God
fervently
to
bless
you
,
and
those
dear
to
you
.
<EOS>
He
said
he
should
like
to
see
you
again
.
<EOS>
But
the
next
moment
he
altered
his
mind
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
"
he
answered
when
I
offered
to
write
.
<EOS>
"
I
wo
n't
distress
him
!
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
distress
him
!
"
  
<EOS>
At
his
request
I
next
collected
the
other
papers
 
that
is
to
say
,
the
bundle
of
letters
,
the
unfinished
book
and
the
volumes
of
the
Diary
 
and
enclosed
them
all
in
one
wrapper
,
sealed
with
my
own
seal
.
<EOS>
"
Promise
,
"
he
said
,
"
that
you
will
put
this
into
my
coffin
with
your
own
hand
;
and
that
you
will
see
that
no
other
hand
touches
it
afterwards
.
"
  
I
gave
him
my
promise
.
<EOS>
And
the
promise
has
been
performed
.
  
<EOS>
He
asked
me
to
do
one
other
thing
for
him
 
which
it
cost
me
a
hard
struggle
to
comply
with
.
<EOS>
He
said
,
"
Let
my
grave
be
forgotten
.
<EOS>
Give
me
your
word
of
honour
that
you
will
allow
no
monument
of
any
sort
 
not
even
the
commonest
tombstone
 
to
mark
the
place
of
my
burial
.
<EOS>
Let
me
sleep
,
nameless
.
<EOS>
Let
me
rest
,
unknown
.
<EOS>
"
When
I
tried
to
plead
with
him
to
alter
his
resolution
,
he
became
for
the
first
,
and
only
time
,
violently
agitated
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
bear
to
see
it
;
and
I
gave
way
.
<EOS>
Nothing
but
a
little
grass
mound
marks
the
place
of
his
rest
.
<EOS>
In
time
,
the
tombstones
will
rise
round
it
.
<EOS>
And
the
people
who
come
after
us
will
look
and
wonder
at
the
nameless
grave
.
  
<EOS>
As
I
have
told
you
,
for
six
hours
before
his
death
his
sufferings
ceased
.
<EOS>
He
dozed
a
little
.
<EOS>
I
think
he
dreamed
.
<EOS>
Once
or
twice
he
smiled
.
<EOS>
A
woman
's
name
,
as
I
suppose
 
the
name
of
"
Ella
"
 
was
often
on
his
lips
at
this
time
.
<EOS>
A
few
minutes
before
the
end
he
asked
me
to
lift
him
on
his
pillow
,
to
see
the
sun
rise
through
the
window
.
<EOS>
He
was
very
weak
.
<EOS>
His
head
fell
on
my
shoulder
.
<EOS>
He
whispered
,
"
It
's
coming
!
"
<EOS>
Then
he
said
,
"
Kiss
me
!
"
<EOS>
I
kissed
his
forehead
.
<EOS>
On
a
sudden
he
lifted
his
head
.
<EOS>
The
sunlight
touched
his
face
.
<EOS>
A
beautiful
expression
,
an
angelic
expression
,
came
over
it
.
<EOS>
He
cried
out
three
times
,
"
Peace
!
<EOS>
peace
!
<EOS>
peace
!
"
<EOS>
His
head
sank
back
again
on
my
shoulder
,
and
the
long
trouble
of
his
life
was
at
an
end
.
  
<EOS>
So
he
has
gone
from
us
.
<EOS>
This
was
,
as
I
think
,
a
great
man
 
though
the
world
never
knew
him
.
<EOS>
He
had
the
sweetest
temper
I
have
ever
met
with
.
<EOS>
The
loss
of
him
makes
me
feel
very
lonely
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
I
have
never
been
quite
myself
since
my
illness
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
,
I
think
of
giving
up
my
practice
,
and
going
away
,
and
trying
what
some
of
the
foreign
baths
and
waters
will
do
for
me
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
reported
here
,
that
you
and
Miss
Verinder
are
to
be
married
next
month
.
<EOS>
Please
to
accept
my
best
congratulations
.
  
<EOS>
The
pages
of
my
poor
friend
's
Journal
are
waiting
for
you
at
my
house
 
sealed
up
,
with
your
name
on
the
wrapper
.
<EOS>
I
was
afraid
to
trust
them
to
the
post
.
  
<EOS>
My
best
respects
and
good
wishes
attend
Miss
Verinder
.
<EOS>
I
remain
,
<EOS>
dear
Mr.
Franklin
Blake
,
truly
yours
,

I
am
the
person
(
as
you
remember
no
doubt
)
<EOS>
who
led
the
way
in
these
pages
,
and
opened
the
story
.
<EOS>
I
am
also
the
person
who
is
left

as
it
were
,
to
close
the

up

<EOS>
Let
nobody
suppose
that
I
have
any
last
words
to
say
here
concerning
the
Indian
Diamond
.
<EOS>
I
hold
that
unlucky
jewel
in
abhorrence
 
<EOS>
and
I
refer
you
to
other
authority
than
mine
,
for
such
news
of
the
Moonstone
as
you
may
,
at
the
present
time
,
be
expected
to
receive
.
<EOS>
My
purpose
,
in
this
place
,
is
to
state
a
fact
in
the
history
of
the
family
,
which
has
been
passed
over
by
everybody
,
and
which
I
wo
n't
allow
to
be
disrespectfully
smothered
up
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
The
fact
to
which
I
allude
is
 
the
marriage
of
Miss
Rachel
and
Mr.
Franklin
Blake
.
<EOS>
This
interesting
event
took
place
at
our
house
in
Yorkshire
,
on
Tuesday
,
October
ninth
,
eighteen
hundred
and
forty
-
nine
.
<EOS>
I
had
a
new
suit
of
clothes
on
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
And
the
married
couple
went
to
spend
the
honeymoon
in
Scotland
.
  
<EOS>
Family
festivals
having
been
rare
enough
at
our
house
,
since
my
poor
mistress
's
death
,
I
own
 
on
this
occasion
of
the
wedding
 
to
having
(
towards
the
latter
part
of
the
day
)
taken
a
drop
too
much
on
the
strength
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
If
you
have
ever
done
the
same
sort
of
thing
yourself
you
will
understand
and
feel
for
me
.
<EOS>
If
you
have
not
,
you
will
very
likely
say
,
"
Disgusting
old
man
!
<EOS>
why
does
he
tell
us
this
?
"
<EOS>
The
reason
why
is
now
to
come
.
  
<EOS>
Having
,
then
,
taken
my
drop
(
bless
you
!
<EOS>
you
have
got
your
favourite
vice
,
too
;
only
your
vice
is
n't
mine
,
and
mine
is
n't
yours
)
<EOS>
,
I
next
applied
the
one
infallible
remedy
 
<EOS>
that
remedy
being
,
as
you
know
,
ROBINSON
CRUSOE
.
<EOS>
Where
I
opened
that
unrivalled
book
,
I
ca
n't
say
.
<EOS>
Where
the
lines
of
print
at
last
left
off
running
into
each
other
,
I
know
,
however
,
perfectly
well
.
<EOS>
It
was
at
page
three
hundred
and
eighteen
 
a
domestic
bit
concerning
Robinson
Crusoe
's
marriage
,
as
follows
:
  
"
With
those
Thoughts
,
I
considered
my
new
Engagement
,
that
I
had
a
Wife
"
 
(
Observe
!
<EOS>
so
had
Mr.
Franklin
!
)
 
<EOS>
"
one
Child
born
"
 
(
Observe
again
!
<EOS>
that
might
yet
be
Mr.
Franklin
's
case
,
too
!
)
 
<EOS>
"
and
my
Wife
then
"
 
<EOS>
What
Robinson
Crusoe
's
wife
did
,
or
did
not
do
,
"
then
,
"
I
felt
no
desire
to
discover
.
<EOS>
I
scored
the
bit
about
the
Child
with
my
pencil
,
and
put
a
morsel
of
paper
for
a
mark
to
keep
the
place
;
"
Lie
you
there
,
"
I
said
,
"
till
the
marriage
of
Mr.
Franklin
and
Miss
Rachel
is
some
months
older
 
<EOS>
and
then
we
'll
see
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
months
passed
(
more
than
I
had
bargained
for
)
,
and
no
occasion
presented
itself
for
disturbing
that
mark
in
the
book
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
till
this
present
month
of
November
,
eighteen
hundred
and
fifty
,
that
Mr.
Franklin
came
into
my
room
,
in
high
good
spirits
,
and
said
,
"
Betteredge
!
<EOS>
I
have
got
some
news
for
you
!
<EOS>
Something
is
going
to
happen
in
the
house
,
before
we
are
many
months
older
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Does
it
concern
the
family
,
sir
?
"
I
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
decidedly
concerns
the
family
,
"
says
Mr.
Franklin
.
  
<EOS>
"
Has
your
good
lady
anything
to
do
with
it
,
if
you
please
,
sir
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
has
a
great
deal
to
do
with
it
,
"
says
Mr.
Franklin
,
beginning
to
look
a
little
surprised
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
need
n't
say
a
word
more
,
sir
,
"
I
answered
.
<EOS>
"
God
bless
you
both
!
<EOS>
I
'm
heartily
glad
to
hear
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Franklin
stared
like
a
person
thunderstruck
.
"
<EOS>
May
I
venture
to
inquire
where
you
got
your
information
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
.
<EOS>
"
I
only
got
mine
(
imparted
in
the
strictest
secrecy
)
five
minutes
since
.
"
  
<EOS>
Here
was
an
opportunity
of
producing
ROBINSON
CRUSOE
!
<EOS>
Here
was
a
chance
of
reading
that
domestic
bit
about
the
child
which
I
had
marked
on
the
day
of
Mr.
Franklin
's
marriage
!
<EOS>
I
read
those
miraculous
words
with
an
emphasis
which
did
them
justice
,
and
then
I
looked
him
severely
in
the
face
.
"
<EOS>
NOW
,
sir
,
do
you
believe
in
ROBINSON
CRUSOE
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
,
with
a
solemnity
,
suitable
to
the
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
"
Betteredge
!
"
says
Mr.
Franklin
,
with
equal
solemnity
,
"
I
'm
convinced
at
last
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
shook
hands
with
me
 
<EOS>
and
I
felt
that
I
had
converted
him
.
  
<EOS>
With
the
relation
of
this
extraordinary
circumstance
,
my
reappearance
in
these
pages
comes
to
an
end
.
<EOS>
Let
nobody
laugh
at
the
unique
anecdote
here
related
.
<EOS>
You
are
welcome
to
be
as
merry
as
you
please
over
everything
else
I
have
written
.
<EOS>
But
when
I
write
of
ROBINSON
CRUSOE
,
by
the
Lord
it
's
serious
 
<EOS>
and
I
request
you
to
take
it
accordingly
!
  
<EOS>
When
this
is
said
,
all
is
said
.
<EOS>
Ladies
and
gentlemen
,
I
make
my
bow
,
and
shut
up
the
story
.
  
<EOS>
