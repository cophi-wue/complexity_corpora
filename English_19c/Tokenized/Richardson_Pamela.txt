   
DEAR
FATHER
AND
MOTHER
,
  
I
have
great
trouble
,
and
some
comfort
,
to
acquaint
you
with
.
 
<EOS>
The
trouble
is
,
that
my
good
lady
died
of
the
illness
I
mentioned
to
you
,
and
left
us
all
much
grieved
for
the
loss
of
her
;
for
she
was
a
dear
good
lady
,
and
kind
to
all
us
her
servants
.
 
<EOS>
Much
I
feared
,
that
as
I
was
taken
by
her
ladyship
to
wait
upon
her
person
,
I
should
be
quite
destitute
again
,
and
forced
to
return
to
you
and
my
poor
mother
,
who
have
enough
to
do
to
maintain
yourselves
;
and
,
as
my
lady
's
goodness
had
put
me
to
write
and
cast
accounts
,
and
made
me
a
little
expert
at
my
needle
,
and
otherwise
qualified
above
my
degree
,
it
was
not
every
family
that
could
have
found
a
place
that
your
poor
Pamela
was
fit
for
:
but
God
,
whose
graciousness
to
us
we
have
so
often
experienced
at
a
pinch
,
put
it
into
my
good
lady
's
heart
,
on
her
death
-
bed
,
just
an
hour
before
she
expired
,
to
recommend
to
my
young
master
all
her
servants
,
one
by
one
;
and
when
it
came
to
my
turn
to
be
recommended
,
(
for
I
was
sobbing
and
crying
at
her
pillow
)
<EOS>
she
could
only
say
,
My
dear
son
!
 
<EOS>
and
so
broke
off
a
little
;
and
then
recovering
 
<EOS>
Remember
my
poor
Pamela
 
<EOS>
And
these
were
some
of
her
last
words
!
 
<EOS>
O
how
my
eyes
run
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
wonder
to
see
the
paper
so
blotted
.
  
<EOS>
Well
,
but
God
's
will
must
be
done
!
 
<EOS>
And
so
comes
the
comfort
,
that
I
shall
not
be
obliged
to
return
back
to
be
a
clog
upon
my
dear
parents
!
<EOS>
For
my
master
said
,
I
will
take
care
of
you
all
,
my
good
maidens
;
and
for
you
,
Pamela
,
(
and
took
me
by
the
hand
;
yes
,
he
took
my
hand
before
them
all
,
)
for
my
dear
mother
's
sake
,
I
will
be
a
friend
to
you
,
and
you
shall
take
care
of
my
linen
.
 
<EOS>
God
bless
him
!
<EOS>
and
pray
with
me
,
my
dear
father
and
mother
,
for
a
blessing
upon
him
,
for
he
has
given
mourning
and
a
year
's
wages
to
all
my
lady
's
servants
;
and
I
having
no
wages
as
yet
,
my
lady
having
said
she
should
do
for
me
as
I
deserved
,
ordered
the
housekeeper
to
give
me
mourning
with
the
rest
;
and
gave
me
with
his
own
hand
four
golden
guineas
,
and
some
silver
,
which
were
in
my
old
lady
's
pocket
when
she
died
;
and
said
,
if
I
was
a
good
girl
,
and
faithful
and
diligent
,
he
would
be
a
friend
to
me
,
for
his
mother
's
sake
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
I
send
you
these
four
guineas
for
your
comfort
;
for
Providence
will
not
let
me
want
:
<EOS>
And
so
you
may
pay
some
old
debt
with
part
,
and
keep
the
other
part
to
comfort
you
both
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
get
more
,
I
am
sure
it
is
my
duty
,
and
it
shall
be
my
care
,
to
love
and
cherish
you
both
;
for
you
have
loved
and
cherished
me
,
when
I
could
do
nothing
for
myself
.
 
<EOS>
I
send
them
by
John
,
our
footman
,
who
goes
your
way
:
but
he
does
not
know
what
he
carries
;
because
I
seal
them
up
in
one
of
the
little
pill
-
boxes
,
which
my
lady
had
,
wrapt
close
in
paper
,
that
they
may
n't
chink
;
and
be
sure
do
n't
open
it
before
him
.
  
<EOS>
I
know
,
dear
father
and
mother
,
I
must
give
you
both
grief
and
pleasure
;
and
<EOS>
so
I
will
only
say
,
Pray
for
your
Pamela
;
who
will
ever
be
                                          
Your
most
dutiful
DAUGHTER
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
been
scared
out
of
my
senses
;
for
just
now
,
as
I
was
folding
up
this
letter
in
my
late
lady
's
dressing
-
room
,
in
comes
my
young
master
!
<EOS>
Good
sirs
!
<EOS>
how
was
I
frightened
!
 
<EOS>
I
went
to
hide
the
letter
in
my
bosom
;
and
he
,
seeing
me
tremble
,
said
,
smiling
,
To
whom
have
you
been
writing
,
Pamela
?
 
<EOS>
I
said
,
in
my
confusion
,
Pray
your
honour
forgive
me
!
 
<EOS>
Only
to
my
father
and
mother
.
 
<EOS>
He
said
,
Well
then
,
let
me
see
how
you
are
come
on
in
your
writing
!
 
<EOS>
O
how
ashamed
I
was
!
 
<EOS>
He
took
it
,
without
saying
more
,
and
read
it
quite
through
,
and
then
gave
it
me
again
;
 
and
<EOS>
I
said
,
Pray
your
honour
forgive
me
!
 
<EOS>
Yet
I
know
not
for
what
:
for
he
was
always
dutiful
to
his
parents
;
and
why
should
he
be
angry
that
I
was
so
to
mine
?
<EOS>
And
indeed
he
was
not
angry
;
for
he
took
me
by
the
hand
,
and
said
,
You
are
a
good
girl
,
Pamela
,
to
be
kind
to
your
aged
father
and
mother
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
angry
with
you
for
writing
such
innocent
matters
as
these
:
though
you
ought
to
be
wary
<EOS>
what
tales
you
send
out
of
a
family
.
 
<EOS>
Be
faithful
and
diligent
;
and
do
as
you
should
do
,
and
I
like
you
the
better
for
this
.
<EOS>
And
then
he
said
,
Why
,
Pamela
,
you
write
a
very
pretty
hand
,
and
spell
tolerably
too
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
my
good
mother
's
care
in
your
learning
has
not
been
thrown
away
upon
you
.
 
<EOS>
She
used
to
say
you
loved
reading
;
you
may
look
into
any
of
her
books
,
to
improve
yourself
,
so
you
take
care
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
To
be
sure
I
did
nothing
but
courtesy
and
cry
,
and
was
all
in
confusion
,
at
his
goodness
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
he
is
the
best
of
gentlemen
,
I
think
!
 
<EOS>
But
I
am
making
another
long
letter
:
<EOS>
So
will
only
add
to
it
,
that
I
shall
ever
be
Your
dutiful
daughter
,
                  
PAMELA
ANDREWS
.
    
<EOS>
[
In
answer
to
the
preceding
.
]
  
<EOS>
DEAR
PAMELA
,
  
<EOS>
Your
letter
was
indeed
a
great
trouble
,
and
some
comfort
,
to
me
and
your
poor
mother
.
 
<EOS>
We
are
troubled
,
to
be
sure
,
for
your
good
lady
's
death
,
who
took
such
care
of
you
,
and
gave
you
learning
,
and
,
for
three
or
four
years
past
,
has
always
been
giving
you
clothes
and
linen
,
and
every
thing
that
a
gentlewoman
need
not
be
ashamed
to
appear
in
.
 
<EOS>
But
our
chief
trouble
is
,
and
indeed
a
very
great
one
,
<EOS>
for
fear
you
should
be
brought
to
anything
dishonest
or
wicked
,
by
being
set
so
above
yourself
.
 
<EOS>
Every
body
talks
how
you
have
come
on
,
and
what
a
genteel
girl
you
are
;
and
some
say
you
are
very
pretty
;
and
,
indeed
,
six
months
since
,
when
I
saw
you
last
,
I
should
have
thought
so
myself
,
if
you
was
not
our
child
.
 
<EOS>
But
what
avails
all
this
,
if
you
are
to
be
ruined
and
undone
!
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
my
dear
Pamela
,
we
begin
to
be
in
great
fear
for
you
;
for
what
signify
all
the
riches
in
the
world
,
with
a
bad
conscience
,
and
to
be
dishonest
!
 
<EOS>
We
are
,
'
tis
true
,
very
poor
,
and
find
it
hard
enough
to
live
;
though
once
,
as
you
know
,
it
was
better
with
us
.
 
<EOS>
But
we
would
sooner
live
upon
the
water
,
and
,
if
possible
,
the
clay
of
the
ditches
I
contentedly
dig
,
than
live
better
at
the
price
of
our
child
's
ruin
.
  
<EOS>
I
hope
the
good
'
squire
has
no
design
:
but
when
he
has
given
you
so
much
money
,
and
speaks
so
kindly
to
you
,
and
praises
your
coming
on
;
and
,
oh
,
that
fatal
word
!
<EOS>
that
he
would
be
kind
to
you
,
if
you
would
do
as
you
should
do
,
almost
kills
us
with
fears
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
spoken
to
good
old
widow
Mumford
about
it
,
who
,
you
know
,
has
formerly
lived
in
good
families
;
and
she
puts
us
in
some
comfort
;
for
she
says
it
is
not
unusual
,
when
a
lady
dies
,
to
give
what
she
has
about
her
person
to
her
waiting
-
maid
,
and
to
such
as
sit
up
with
her
in
her
illness
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
then
,
why
should
he
smile
so
kindly
upon
you
?
 
<EOS>
Why
should
he
take
such
a
poor
girl
as
you
by
the
hand
,
as
your
letter
says
he
has
done
twice
?
 
<EOS>
Why
should
he
stoop
to
read
your
letter
to
us
;
and
commend
your
writing
and
spelling
?
 
<EOS>
And
why
should
he
give
you
leave
to
read
his
mother
's
books
?
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
indeed
,
my
dearest
child
,
our
hearts
ache
for
you
;
and
then
you
seem
so
full
of
joy
at
his
goodness
,
so
taken
with
his
kind
expressions
,
(
which
,
truly
,
are
very
great
favours
,
if
he
means
well
)
that
we
fear
 
<EOS>
yes
,
my
dear
child
,
we
fear
 
you
should
be
too
grateful
,
 
and
reward
him
with
that
jewel
,
your
virtue
,
which
no
riches
,
nor
favour
,
nor
any
thing
in
this
life
,
can
make
up
to
you
.
  
<EOS>
I
,
too
,
have
written
a
long
letter
,
but
will
say
one
thing
more
;
and
that
is
,
that
,
in
the
midst
of
our
poverty
and
misfortunes
,
we
have
trusted
in
God
's
goodness
,
and
been
honest
,
and
doubt
not
to
be
happy
hereafter
,
if
we
continue
to
be
good
,
though
our
lot
is
hard
here
;
but
the
loss
of
our
dear
child
's
virtue
would
be
a
grief
that
we
could
not
bear
,
and
would
bring
our
grey
hairs
to
the
grave
at
once
.
  
<EOS>
If
,
then
,
you
love
us
,
if
you
wish
for
God
's
blessing
,
and
your
own
future
happiness
,
we
both
charge
you
to
stand
upon
your
guard
:
<EOS>
and
,
if
you
find
the
least
attempt
made
upon
your
virtue
,
be
sure
you
leave
every
thing
behind
you
,
and
come
away
to
us
;
for
we
had
rather
see
you
all
covered
with
rags
,
and
even
follow
you
to
the
churchyard
,
than
have
it
said
,
a
child
of
ours
preferred
any
worldly
conveniences
to
her
virtue
.
  
<EOS>
We
accept
kindly
your
dutiful
present
;
but
,
till
we
are
out
of
pain
,
can
not
make
use
of
it
,
for
fear
we
should
partake
of
the
price
of
our
poor
daughter
's
shame
:
so
have
laid
it
up
in
a
rag
among
the
thatch
,
over
the
window
,
for
a
while
,
lest
we
should
be
robbed
.
 
<EOS>
With
our
blessings
,
and
our
hearty
prayers
for
you
,
we
remain
,
            
Your
careful
,
but
loving
Father
and
Mother
,
                                      
JOHN
AND
ELIZABETH
ANDREWS
.
    
<EOS>
DEAR
FATHER
,
  
<EOS>
I
must
needs
say
,
your
letter
has
filled
me
with
trouble
,
for
it
has
made
my
heart
,
which
was
overflowing
with
gratitude
for
my
master
's
goodness
,
suspicious
and
fearful
:
<EOS>
and
yet
I
hope
I
shall
never
find
him
to
act
unworthy
of
his
character
;
for
what
could
he
get
by
ruining
such
a
poor
young
creature
as
me
?
 
<EOS>
But
that
which
gives
me
most
trouble
is
,
that
you
seem
to
mistrust
the
honesty
of
your
child
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
my
dear
father
and
mother
,
be
assured
,
that
,
by
God
's
grace
,
I
never
will
do
any
thing
that
shall
bring
your
grey
hairs
with
sorrow
to
the
grave
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
die
a
thousand
deaths
,
rather
than
be
dishonest
any
way
.
 
<EOS>
Of
that
be
assured
,
and
set
your
hearts
at
rest
;
for
although
I
have
lived
above
myself
for
some
time
past
,
yet
I
can
be
content
with
rags
and
poverty
,
and
bread
and
water
,
and
will
embrace
them
,
rather
than
forfeit
<EOS>
my
good
name
,
let
who
will
be
the
tempter
.
 
<EOS>
And
of
this
pray
rest
satisfied
,
and
think
better
of
                             
Your
dutiful
DAUGHTER
till
death
.
  
<EOS>
My
master
continues
to
be
very
affable
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
As
yet
I
see
no
cause
to
fear
any
thing
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jervis
,
the
housekeeper
,
too
,
is
very
civil
to
me
,
and
I
have
the
love
of
every
body
.
 
<EOS>
Sure
they
ca
n't
all
have
designs
against
me
,
because
they
are
civil
!
 
<EOS>
I
hope
I
shall
always
behave
so
as
to
be
respected
by
every
one
;
and
that
nobody
would
do
me
more
hurt
than
I
am
sure
I
would
do
them
.
 
<EOS>
Our
John
so
often
goes
your
way
,
that
I
will
always
get
him
to
call
,
that
you
may
hear
from
me
,
either
by
writing
,
(
for
it
brings
my
hand
in
,
)
or
by
word
of
mouth
.
    
<EOS>
DEAR
MOTHER
,
  
For
the
last
was
to
my
father
,
in
answer
to
his
letter
;
and
so
I
will
now
write
to
you
;
though
I
have
nothing
to
say
,
but
what
will
make
me
look
more
like
a
vain
hussy
,
than
any
thing
else
:
<EOS>
However
,
I
hope
I
sha
n't
be
so
proud
as
to
forget
myself
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
there
is
a
secret
pleasure
one
has
to
hear
one
's
self
praised
.
 
<EOS>
You
must
know
,
then
,
that
my
Lady
Davers
,
who
,
I
need
not
tell
you
,
is
my
master
's
sister
,
has
been
a
month
at
our
house
,
and
has
taken
great
notice
of
me
,
and
given
me
good
advice
to
keep
myself
to
myself
.
 
<EOS>
She
told
me
I
was
a
pretty
wench
,
and
that
every
body
gave
me
a
very
good
character
,
and
loved
me
;
and
bid
me
take
care
to
keep
the
fellows
at
a
distance
;
and
said
,
that
I
might
do
,
and
be
more
valued
for
it
,
even
by
themselves
.
  
<EOS>
But
what
pleased
me
much
was
,
what
I
am
going
to
tell
you
;
for
at
table
,
<EOS>
as
Mrs.
Jervis
says
,
my
master
and
her
ladyship
talking
of
me
,
she
told
him
she
thought
me
the
prettiest
wench
<EOS>
she
ever
saw
in
her
life
;
and
that
I
was
too
pretty
to
live
in
a
bachelor
's
house
;
since
no
lady
he
might
marry
would
care
to
continue
me
with
her
.
 
<EOS>
He
said
,
I
was
vastly
improved
,
and
had
a
good
share
of
prudence
,
and
sense
above
my
years
;
and
that
it
would
be
pity
,
that
what
was
my
merit
should
be
my
misfortune
.
  
<EOS>
No
,
says
my
good
lady
,
Pamela
shall
come
and
live
with
me
,
I
think
.
 
<EOS>
He
said
,
with
all
his
heart
;
he
should
be
glad
to
have
me
so
well
provided
for
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
said
she
,
I
'll
consult
my
lord
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
She
asked
how
old
I
was
;
and
Mrs.
Jervis
said
,
I
was
fifteen
last
February
.
 
<EOS>
O
!
<EOS>
says
she
,
if
the
wench
(
for
so
she
calls
all
us
maiden
servants
)
takes
care
of
herself
,
she
'll
improve
yet
more
and
more
,
as
well
in
her
person
as
mind
.
  
<EOS>
Now
,
my
dear
father
and
mother
,
though
this
may
look
too
vain
to
be
repeated
by
me
;
yet
are
you
not
rejoiced
,
as
well
as
<EOS>
I
,
to
see
my
master
so
willing
to
part
with
me
?
 
<EOS>
This
shews
that
he
has
nothing
bad
in
his
heart
.
 
<EOS>
But
John
is
just
going
away
;
and
<EOS>
so
I
have
only
to
say
,
that
I
am
,
and
will
always
be
,
                         
Your
honest
as
well
as
dutiful
DAUGHTER
.
  
<EOS>
Pray
make
use
of
the
money
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
now
do
it
safely
.
    
<EOS>
MY
DEAR
FATHER
AND
MOTHER
,
  
<EOS>
John
being
to
go
your
way
<EOS>
,
I
am
willing
to
write
,
because
he
is
so
willing
to
carry
any
thing
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
He
says
it
does
him
good
at
his
heart
to
see
you
both
,
and
to
hear
you
talk
.
 
<EOS>
He
says
you
are
both
so
sensible
,
and
so
honest
,
that
he
always
learns
something
from
you
to
the
purpose
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
thousand
pities
,
he
says
,
that
such
worthy
hearts
should
not
have
better
luck
in
the
world
!
<EOS>
and
wonders
,
that
you
,
my
father
,
who
are
so
well
able
to
teach
,
and
write
so
good
a
hand
,
succeeded
no
better
in
the
school
you
attempted
to
set
up
;
but
was
forced
to
go
to
such
hard
labour
.
<EOS>
But
this
is
more
pride
to
me
,
that
I
am
come
of
such
honest
parents
,
than
if
I
had
been
born
a
lady
.
  
<EOS>
I
hear
nothing
yet
of
going
to
Lady
Davers
;
and
I
am
very
easy
at
present
here
:
for
Mrs.
Jervis
uses
me
as
if
I
were
her
own
daughter
,
and
is
a
very
good
woman
,
and
makes
my
master
's
interest
her
own
.
 
<EOS>
She
is
always
giving
me
good
counsel
,
and
I
love
her
next
to
you
two
,
I
think
,
best
of
any
body
.
 
<EOS>
She
keeps
so
good
rule
and
order
,
she
is
mightily
respected
by
us
all
;
and
takes
delight
to
hear
me
read
to
her
;
and
all
she
loves
to
hear
read
,
is
good
books
,
which
we
read
whenever
we
are
alone
;
so
that
I
think
I
am
at
home
with
you
.
 
<EOS>
She
heard
one
of
our
men
,
Harry
,
who
is
no
better
than
he
should
be
,
speak
freely
to
me
;
I
think
he
called
me
his
pretty
Pamela
,
and
took
hold
of
me
,
as
if
he
would
have
kissed
me
;
for
which
,
you
may
be
sure
,
I
was
very
angry
:
and
she
took
him
to
task
,
and
was
as
angry
at
him
as
could
be
;
and
told
me
she
was
very
well
pleased
to
see
my
prudence
and
modesty
,
and
that
I
kept
all
the
fellows
at
a
distance
.
 
<EOS>
And
indeed
I
am
sure
I
am
not
proud
,
and
carry
it
civilly
to
every
body
;
<EOS>
but
yet
,
methinks
,
I
can
not
bear
to
be
looked
upon
by
these
men
-
servants
,
for
they
seem
as
if
they
would
look
one
through
;
and
,
as
I
generally
breakfast
,
dine
,
and
sup
,
with
Mrs.
Jervis
,
(
so
good
she
is
to
me
,
)
<EOS>
I
am
very
easy
that
I
have
so
little
to
say
to
them
.
 
<EOS>
Not
<EOS>
but
they
are
civil
to
me
in
the
main
,
for
Mrs.
Jervis
's
sake
,
who
they
see
loves
me
;
and
they
stand
in
awe
of
her
,
knowing
her
to
be
a
gentlewoman
born
,
though
she
has
had
misfortunes
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
going
on
again
with
a
long
letter
;
for
I
love
writing
,
and
shall
tire
you
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
when
I
began
,
I
only
intended
to
say
,
that
I
am
quite
fearless
of
any
danger
now
:
and
,
indeed
,
can
not
but
wonder
at
myself
,
(
though
your
caution
to
me
was
your
watchful
love
,
)
<EOS>
that
I
should
be
so
foolish
as
to
be
so
uneasy
as
I
have
been
:
for
I
am
sure
my
master
would
not
demean
himself
,
so
as
to
think
upon
such
a
poor
girl
as
I
,
for
my
harm
.
 
<EOS>
For
such
a
thing
would
ruin
his
credit
,
as
well
as
mine
,
you
know
:
who
,
to
be
sure
,
may
expect
one
of
the
best
ladies
in
the
land
.
 
<EOS>
So
no
more
at
present
,
but
that
I
am
                                           
Your
ever
dutiful
DAUGHTER
.
    
<EOS>
DEAR
FATHER
AND
MOTHER
,
  
<EOS>
My
master
has
been
very
kind
since
my
last
;
for
he
has
given
me
a
suit
of
my
late
lady
's
clothes
,
and
half
a
dozen
of
her
shifts
,
and
six
fine
handkerchiefs
,
and
three
of
her
cambric
aprons
,
and
four
holland
ones
.
<EOS>
The
clothes
are
fine
silk
,
and
too
rich
and
too
good
for
me
,
to
be
sure
.
<EOS>
I
wish
it
was
no
affront
to
him
to
make
money
of
them
,
and
send
it
to
you
:
it
would
do
me
more
good
.
  
<EOS>
You
will
be
full
of
fears
,
I
warrant
now
,
of
some
design
upon
me
,
till
I
tell
you
,
that
he
was
with
Mrs.
Jervis
when
he
gave
them
me
;
and
he
gave
her
a
mort
of
good
things
,
at
the
same
time
,
and
bid
her
wear
them
in
remembrance
of
her
good
friend
,
my
lady
,
his
mother
.
 
<EOS>
And
when
he
gave
me
these
fine
things
,
he
said
,
These
,
Pamela
,
are
for
you
;
have
them
made
fit
for
you
,
when
your
mourning
is
laid
by
,
and
wear
them
for
your
good
mistress
's
sake
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jervis
gives
you
a
very
good
word
;
and
I
would
have
you
continue
to
behave
as
prudently
as
you
have
done
hitherto
,
and
every
body
will
be
your
friend
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
so
surprised
at
his
goodness
,
that
I
could
not
tell
what
to
say
.
 
<EOS>
I
courtesied
to
him
,
and
to
Mrs.
Jervis
for
her
good
word
;
and
said
,
I
wished
I
might
be
deserving
of
his
favour
,
and
her
kindness
:
<EOS>
and
nothing
should
be
wanting
in
me
,
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
.
  
<EOS>
O
how
amiable
a
thing
is
doing
good
!
 
<EOS>
It
is
all
I
envy
great
folks
for
.
  
<EOS>
I
always
thought
my
young
master
a
fine
gentleman
,
as
every
body
says
he
is
:
but
he
gave
these
good
things
to
us
both
with
such
a
graciousness
,
as
I
thought
he
looked
like
an
angel
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jervis
says
,
he
asked
her
,
If
I
kept
the
men
at
a
distance
?
<EOS>
for
,
he
said
,
I
was
very
pretty
;
and
to
be
drawn
in
to
have
any
of
them
,
might
be
my
ruin
,
and
make
me
poor
and
miserable
betimes
.
 
<EOS>
She
never
is
wanting
to
give
me
a
good
word
,
and
took
occasion
to
lanch
out
in
my
praise
,
she
says
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
hope
she
has
said
no
more
than
I
shall
try
to
deserve
,
though
I
may
n't
at
present
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
sure
I
will
always
love
her
,
next
to
you
and
my
dear
mother
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
rest
                                    
<EOS>
Your
ever
dutiful
DAUGHTER
.
    
<EOS>
DEAR
FATHER
,
  
<EOS>
Since
my
last
,
my
master
gave
me
more
fine
things
.
 
<EOS>
He
called
me
up
to
my
late
lady
's
closet
,
and
,
pulling
out
her
drawers
,
he
gave
me
two
suits
of
fine
Flanders
laced
headclothes
,
three
pair
of
fine
silk
shoes
,
two
hardly
the
worse
,
and
just
fit
for
me
,
(
for
my
lady
had
a
very
little
foot
,
)
and
the
other
with
wrought
silver
buckles
in
them
;
and
several
ribands
and
top
-
knots
of
all
colours
;
four
pair
of
white
fine
cotton
stockings
,
and
three
pair
of
fine
silk
ones
;
and
two
pair
of
rich
stays
.
<EOS>
I
was
quite
astonished
,
and
unable
to
speak
for
a
while
;
but
yet
I
was
inwardly
ashamed
to
take
the
stockings
;
for
Mrs.
Jervis
was
not
there
:
If
she
had
,
it
would
have
been
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
I
received
them
very
awkwardly
;
for
he
smiled
at
my
awkwardness
,
and
said
,
Do
n't
blush
,
<EOS>
Pamela
:
<EOS>
Dost
think
I
do
n't
know
pretty
maids
should
wear
shoes
and
stockings
?
  
<EOS>
I
was
so
confounded
at
these
words
,
you
might
have
beat
me
down
with
a
feather
.
 
<EOS>
For
you
must
think
,
there
was
no
answer
to
be
made
to
this
:
<EOS>
So
,
like
a
fool
,
I
was
ready
to
cry
;
and
went
away
courtesying
and
blushing
,
I
am
sure
,
up
to
the
ears
;
for
,
though
there
was
no
harm
in
what
he
said
,
yet
I
did
not
know
how
to
take
it
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
went
and
told
all
to
Mrs.
Jervis
,
who
said
,
God
put
it
into
his
heart
to
be
good
to
me
;
and
I
must
double
my
diligence
.
 
<EOS>
It
looked
to
her
,
she
said
,
as
if
he
would
fit
me
in
dress
for
a
waiting
-
maid
's
place
on
Lady
Davers
's
own
person
.
  
<EOS>
But
still
your
kind
fatherly
cautions
came
into
my
head
,
and
made
all
these
gifts
nothing
near
to
me
what
they
would
have
been
.
 
<EOS>
But
yet
,
I
hope
,
there
is
no
reason
;
for
what
good
could
it
do
to
him
to
harm
such
a
simple
maiden
as
me
?
 
<EOS>
Besides
,
to
be
sure
no
lady
would
look
upon
him
,
if
he
should
so
disgrace
himself
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
will
make
myself
easy
;
and
,
indeed
,
I
should
never
have
been
otherwise
,
if
you
had
not
put
it
into
my
head
;
for
my
good
,
I
know
very
well
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
may
be
,
without
these
uneasinesses
to
mingle
with
these
benefits
,
I
might
be
too
much
puffed
up
:
<EOS>
So
I
will
conclude
,
all
that
happens
is
for
our
good
;
and
God
bless
you
,
my
dear
father
and
mother
;
and
I
know
you
constantly
pray
for
a
blessing
upon
me
;
who
am
,
and
shall
always
be
,
                                    
Your
dutiful
DAUGHTER
.
    
<EOS>
DEAR
PAMELA
,
  
<EOS>
I
can
not
but
renew
my
cautions
on
your
master
's
kindness
,
and
his
free
expression
to
you
about
the
stockings
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
there
may
not
be
,
and
<EOS>
I
hope
there
is
not
,
any
thing
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
But
when
I
reflect
,
that
there
possibly
may
,
and
that
if
there
should
,
no
less
depends
upon
it
than
my
child
's
everlasting
happiness
in
this
world
and
the
next
;
it
is
enough
to
make
one
fearful
for
you
.
 
<EOS>
Arm
yourself
,
my
dear
child
,
for
the
worst
;
and
resolve
to
lose
your
life
sooner
than
your
virtue
.
 
<EOS>
What
though
the
doubts
I
filled
you
with
,
lessen
the
pleasure
you
would
have
had
in
your
master
's
kindness
;
yet
what
signify
the
delights
that
arise
from
a
few
paltry
fine
clothes
,
in
comparison
with
a
good
conscience
?
  
<EOS>
These
are
,
indeed
,
very
great
favours
that
he
heaps
upon
you
,
but
so
much
the
more
to
be
suspected
;
and
when
you
say
he
looked
so
amiably
,
and
like
an
angel
,
how
afraid
I
am
,
that
they
should
make
too
great
an
impression
upon
you
!
 
<EOS>
For
,
though
you
are
blessed
with
sense
and
prudence
above
your
years
,
yet
I
tremble
to
think
,
what
a
sad
hazard
a
poor
maiden
of
little
more
than
fifteen
years
of
age
stands
against
the
temptations
of
this
world
,
and
a
designing
young
gentleman
,
if
he
should
prove
so
,
who
has
so
much
power
to
oblige
,
and
has
a
kind
of
authority
to
command
,
as
your
master
.
  
<EOS>
I
charge
you
,
my
dear
child
,
on
both
our
blessings
,
poor
as
we
are
,
to
be
on
your
guard
;
there
can
be
no
harm
in
that
.
 
<EOS>
And
since
Mrs.
Jervis
is
so
good
a
gentlewoman
,
and
so
kind
to
you
,
I
am
the
easier
a
great
deal
,
and
so
is
your
mother
;
and
we
hope
you
will
hide
nothing
from
her
,
and
take
her
counsel
in
every
thing
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
with
our
blessings
,
and
assured
prayers
for
you
,
more
than
for
ourselves
,
we
remain
,
                                    
Your
loving
FATHER
AND

Be
sure
do
n't
let
people
's
telling
you
,
you
are
pretty
,
puff
you
up
;
for
you
did
not
make
yourself
,
and
so
can
have
no
praise
due
to
you
for
it
.
<EOS>
It
is
virtue
and
goodness
only
,
that
make
the
true
beauty
.
 
<EOS>
Remember
that

<EOS>
DEAR
FATHER
AND
MOTHER
,
  
I
am
sorry
to
write
you
word
,
that
the
hopes
I
had
of
going
to
wait
on
Lady
Davers
,
are
quite
over
.
 
<EOS>
My
lady
would
have
had
me
;
but
my
master
,
as
I
heard
by
the
by
,
would
not
consent
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
said
her
nephew
might
be
taken
with
me
,
and
I
might
draw
him
in
,
or
be
drawn
in
by
him
;
and
he
thought
,
as
his
mother
loved
me
,
and
committed
me
to
his
care
,
he
ought
to
continue
me
with
him
;
and
Mrs.
Jervis
would
be
a
mother
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jervis
tells
me
the
lady
shook
her
head
,
and
said
,
Ah
!
brother
!
<EOS>
and
that
was
all
.
 
<EOS>
And
as
you
have
made
me
fearful
by
your
cautions
,
my
heart
at
times
misgives
me
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
say
nothing
yet
of
your
caution
,
or
my
own
uneasiness
,
to
Mrs.
Jervis
;
not
that
I
mistrust
her
,
but
for
fear
she
should
think
me
presumptuous
,
and
vain
and
conceited
,
to
have
any
fears
about
the
matter
,
from
the
great
distance
between
such
a
gentleman
,
and
so
poor
a
girl
.
 
<EOS>
But
yet
Mrs.
Jervis
seemed
to
build
something
upon
Lady
Davers
's
shaking
her
head
,
and
saying
,
Ah
!
brother
!
<EOS>
and
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
God
,
I
hope
,
will
give
me
his
grace
:
and
so
I
will
not
,
if
I
can
help
it
,
make
myself
too
uneasy
;
for
I
hope
there
is
no
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
But
every
little
matter
that
happens
,
I
will
acquaint
you
with
,
that
you
may
continue
to
me
your
good
advice
,
and
pray
for
                               
Your
sad
-
hearted
PAMELA
.
    
<EOS>
DEAR
MOTHER
,
  
<EOS>
You
and
my
good
father
may
wonder
you
have
not
had
a
letter
from
me
in
so
many
weeks
;
but
a
sad
,
sad
scene
,
has
been
the
occasion
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
For
to
be
sure
,
now
it
is
too
plain
,
that
all
your
cautions
were
well
grounded
.
 
<EOS>
O
my
dear
mother
!
 
<EOS>
I
am
miserable
,
truly
miserable
!
 
<EOS>
But
yet
,
do
n't
be
frightened
,
I
am
honest
!
 
<EOS>
God
,
of
his
goodness
,
keep
me
so
!
  
<EOS>
O
this
angel
of
a
master
!
<EOS>
this
fine
gentleman
!
<EOS>
this
gracious
benefactor
to
your
poor
Pamela
!
<EOS>
who
was
to
take
care
of
me
at
the
prayer
of
his
good
dying
mother
;
who
was
so
apprehensive
for
me
,
lest
I
should
be
drawn
in
by
Lord
Davers
's
nephew
,
that
he
would
not
let
me
go
to
Lady
Davers
's
:
<EOS>
This
very
gentleman
(
yes
,
I
must
call
him
gentleman
,
though
he
has
fallen
from
the
merit
of
that
title
)
has
degraded
himself
to
offer
freedoms
to
his
poor
servant
!
 
<EOS>
He
has
now
shewed
himself
in
his
true
colours
;
and
,
to
me
,
nothing
appear
so
black
,
and
so
frightful
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
not
been
idle
;
but
had
writ
from
time
to
time
,
how
he
,
by
sly
mean
degrees
,
exposed
his
wicked
views
;
but
somebody
stole
my
letter
,
and
I
know
not
what
has
become
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
very
long
one
.
 
<EOS>
I
fear
,
he
that
was
mean
enough
to
do
bad
things
,
in
one
respect
,
did
not
stick
at
this
.
<EOS>
But
be
it
as
it
will
,
all
the
use
he
can
make
of
it
will
be
,
that
he
may
be
ashamed
of
his
part
;
<EOS>
I
not
of
mine
:
for
he
will
see
I
was
resolved
to
be
virtuous
,
and
gloried
in
the
honesty
of
my
poor
parents
.
  
<EOS>
I
will
tell
you
all
,
the
next
opportunity
;
for
I
am
watched
very
narrowly
;
and
he
says
to
Mrs.
Jervis
,
This
girl
is
always
scribbling
;
I
think
she
may
be
better
employed
.
 
<EOS>
And
yet
I
work
all
hours
with
my
needle
,
upon
his
linen
,
and
the
fine
linen
of
the
family
;
and
am
,
besides
,
about
flowering
him
a
waistcoat
.
 
<EOS>
But
<EOS>
,
oh
!
<EOS>
my
heart
's
broke
almost
;
for
what
am
I
likely
to
have
for
my
reward
,
but
shame
and
disgrace
,
or
else
ill
words
,
and
hard
treatment
!
 
<EOS>
I
'll
tell
you
all
soon
,
and
hope
I
shall
find
my
long
letter
.
                                       
<EOS>
Your
most
afflicted
DAUGHTER
.
  
<EOS>
May
-
be
,
I
he
and
him
too
much
:
<EOS>
but
it
is
his
own
fault
if
I
do
.
 
<EOS>
For
why
did
he
lose
all
his
dignity
with
me
?
    
<EOS>
DEAR
MOTHER
,
  
<EOS>
Well
,
I
ca
n't
find
my
letter
,
and
so
I
'll
try
to
recollect
it
all
,
and
be
as
brief
as
I
can
.
 
<EOS>
All
went
well
enough
in
the
main
for
some
time
after
my
letter
but
one
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
,
I
saw
some
reason
to
suspect
;
for
he
would
look
upon
me
,
whenever
he
saw
me
,
in
such
a
manner
,
as
shewed
not
well
;
and
one
day
he
came
to
me
,
as
I
was
in
the
summer
-
house
in
the
little
garden
,
at
work
with
my
needle
,
and
Mrs.
Jervis
was
just
gone
from
me
;
and
I
would
have
gone
out
,
but
<EOS>
he
said
,
No
do
n't
go
,
Pamela
;
I
have
something
to
say
to
you
;
and
you
always
fly
me
when
I
come
near
you
,
as
if
you
were
afraid
of
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
much
out
of
countenance
,
you
may
well
think
;
but
said
,
at
last
,
It
does
not
become
your
good
servant
to
stay
in
your
presence
,
sir
,
without
your
business
required
it
;
and
I
hope
I
shall
always
know
my
place
.
  
<EOS>
Well
,
says
he
,
my
business
does
require
it
sometimes
;
and
I
have
a
mind
you
should
stay
to
hear
what
I
have
to
say
to
you
.
  
<EOS>
I
stood
still
confounded
,
and
began
to
tremble
,
and
the
more
when
he
took
me
by
the
hand
;
for
now
no
soul
was
near
us
.
  
<EOS>
My
sister
Davers
,
said
he
,
(
and
seemed
,
I
thought
,
to
be
as
much
at
a
loss
for
words
as
I
,
)
would
have
had
you
live
with
her
;
but
she
would
not
do
for
you
what
I
am
resolved
to
do
,
if
you
continue
faithful
and
obliging
.
 
<EOS>
What
say'st
thou
,
my
girl
?
<EOS>
said
he
,
with
some
eagerness
;
had'st
thou
not
rather
stay
with
me
,
than
go
to
my
sister
Davers
?
 
<EOS>
He
looked
so
,
as
filled
me
with
affrightment
;
I
do
n't
know
how
;
wildly
,
I
thought
.
  
<EOS>
I
said
,
when
I
could
speak
,
Your
honour
will
forgive
me
;
<EOS>
but
as
you
have
no
lady
for
me
to
wait
upon
,
and
my
good
lady
has
been
now
dead
this
twelvemonth
,
I
had
rather
,
if
it
would
not
displease
you
,
wait
upon
Lady
Davers
,
because
   
I
was
proceeding
,
and
he
said
,
a
little
hastily
 
<EOS>
Because
you
are
a
little
fool
,
and
know
not
what
's
good
for
yourself
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
you
I
will
make
a
gentlewoman
of
you
,
if
you
be
obliging
,
and
do
n't
stand
in
your
own
light
;
and
so
saying
,
he
put
his
arm
about
me
,
and
kissed
me
!
  
<EOS>
Now
,
you
will
say
,
all
his
wickedness
appeared
plainly
.
 
<EOS>
I
struggled
and
trembled
,
and
was
so
benumbed
with
terror
,
that
I
sunk
down
,
not
in
a
fit
,
and
yet
not
myself
;
and
I
found
myself
in
his
arms
,
quite
void
of
strength
;
and
he
kissed
me
two
or
three
times
,
with
frightful
eagerness
.
  
<EOS>
A
t
last
I
burst
from
him
,
and
was
getting
out
of
the
summer
-
house
;
but
he
held
me
back
,
and
shut
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
I
would
have
given
my
life
for
a
farthing
.
 
<EOS>
And
he
said
,
I
'll
do
you
no
harm
,
Pamela
;
do
n't
be
afraid
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
said
,
I
wo
n't
stay
.
 
<EOS>
You
wo
n't
,
hussy
!
<EOS>
said
he
:
<EOS>
Do
you
know
whom
you
speak
to
?
 
<EOS>
I
lost
all
fear
,
and
all
respect
,
and
said
,
Yes
,
I
do
,
sir
,
too
well
!
 
<EOS>
Well
may
I
forget
that
I
am
your
servant
,
when
you
forget
what
belongs
to
a
master
.
  
<EOS>
I
sobbed
and
cried
most
sadly
.
 
<EOS>
What
a
foolish
hussy
you
are
!
<EOS>
said
he
:
<EOS>
Have
I
done
you
any
harm
?
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
sir
,
said
I
,
the
greatest
harm
in
the
world
:
<EOS>
You
have
taught
me
to
forget
myself
and
what
belongs
to
me
,
and
have
lessened
the
distance
that
fortune
has
made
between
us
,
by
demeaning
yourself
,
to
be
so
free
to
a
poor
servant
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
,
sir
,
I
will
be
bold
to
say
,
I
am
honest
,
though
poor
:
and
if
you
was
a
prince
,
I
would
not
be
otherwise
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
angry
,
and
said
,
Who
would
have
you
otherwise
,
you
foolish
slut
!
<EOS>
Cease
your
blubbering
.
 
<EOS>
I
own
I
have
demeaned
myself
;
but
it
was
only
to
try
you
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
can
keep
this
matter
secret
,
you
'll
give
me
the
better
opinion
of
your
prudence
;
and
here
's
something
,
said
he
,
putting
some
gold
in
my
hand
,
to
make
you
amends
for
the
fright
<EOS>
I
put
you
in
.
 
<EOS>
Go
,
take
a
walk
in
the
garden
,
and
do
n't
go
in
till
your
blubbering
is
over
:
and
I
charge
you
say
nothing
of
what
is
past
,
and
all
shall
be
well
,
and
I
'll
forgive
you
.
  
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
take
the
money
,
indeed
,
sir
,
said
I
,
poor
as
I
am
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
take
it
.
 
<EOS>
For
,
to
say
truth
,
I
thought
it
looked
like
taking
earnest
,
and
so
I
put
it
upon
the
bench
;
and
as
he
seemed
vexed
and
confused
at
what
he
had
done
,
I
took
the
opportunity
to
open
the
door
,
and
went
out
of
the
summer
-
house
.
  
<EOS>
He
called
to
me
,
and
said
,
Be
secret
<EOS>
;
I
charge
you
,
Pamela
;
and
do
n't
go
in
yet
,
as
I
told
you
.
  
<EOS>
O
how
poor
and
mean
must
those
actions
be
,
and
how
little
must
they
make
the
best
of
gentlemen
look
,
when
they
offer
such
things
as
are
unworthy
of
themselves
,
and
put
it
into
the
power
of
their
inferiors
to
be
greater
than
they
!
  
<EOS>
I
took
a
turn
or
two
in
the
garden
,
but
in
sight
of
the
house
,
for
fear
of
the
worst
;
and
breathed
upon
my
hand
to
dry
my
eyes
,
because
I
would
not
be
too
disobedient
.
 
<EOS>
My
next
shall
tell
you
more
.
  
<EOS>
Pray
for
me
,
my
dear
father
and
mother
:
and
do
n't
be
angry
<EOS>
I
have
not
yet
run
away
from
this
house
,
so
late
my
comfort
and
delight
,
but
now
my
terror
and
anguish
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
forced
to
break
off
hastily
.
                                 
<EOS>
Your
dutiful
and
honest
DAUGHTER
.
    
<EOS>
DEAR
MOTHER
,
  
<EOS>
Well
,
I
will
now
proceed
with
my
sad
story
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
,
after
I
had
dried
my
eyes
,
I
went
in
,
and
began
to
ruminate
with
myself
what
I
had
best
to
do
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
I
thought
I
would
leave
the
house
and
go
to
the
next
town
,
and
wait
an
opportunity
to
get
to
you
;
but
then
I
was
at
a
loss
to
resolve
whether
to
take
away
the
things
he
had
given
me
or
no
,
and
how
to
take
them
away
:
<EOS>
Sometimes
I
thought
to
leave
them
behind
me
,
and
only
go
with
the
clothes
on
my
back
,
but
then
I
had
two
miles
and
a
half
,
and
a
byway
,
to
the
town
;
and
being
pretty
well
dressed
,
I
might
come
to
some
harm
,
almost
as
bad
as
what
I
would
run
away
from
;
and
then
may
-
be
,
thought
I
,
it
will
be
reported
,
I
have
stolen
something
,
and
so
was
forced
to
run
away
;
and
to
carry
a
bad
name
back
with
me
to
my
dear
parents
,
would
be
a
sad
thing
indeed
!
 
<EOS>
O
how
I
wished
for
my
grey
russet
again
,
and
my
poor
honest
dress
,
with
which
you
fitted
me
out
,
(
and
hard
enough
too
it
was
for
you
to
do
it
!
)
<EOS>
for
going
to
this
place
,
when
I
was
not
twelve
years
old
,
in
my
good
lady
's
days
!
 
<EOS>
Sometimes
I
thought
of
telling
Mrs.
Jervis
,
and
taking
her
advice
,
and
only
feared
his
command
to
be
secret
;
for
,
thought
I
,
he
may
be
ashamed
of
his
actions
,
and
never
attempt
the
like
again
:
<EOS>
And
as
poor
Mrs.
Jervis
depended
upon
him
,
through
misfortunes
,
that
had
attended
her
,
I
thought
it
would
be
a
sad
thing
to
bring
his
displeasure
upon
her
for
my
sake
.
  
<EOS>
In
this
quandary
,
now
considering
,
now
crying
,
and
not
knowing
what
to
do
,
I
passed
the
time
in
my
chamber
till
evening
;
when
desiring
to
be
excused
going
to
supper
,
Mrs.
Jervis
came
up
to
me
,
and
said
,
Why
must
I
sup
without
you
,
Pamela
?
 
<EOS>
Come
,
I
see
you
are
troubled
at
something
;
tell
me
what
is
the
matter
.
  
<EOS>
I
begged
I
might
be
permitted
to
be
with
her
on
nights
;
for
I
was
afraid
of
spirits
,
and
they
would
not
hurt
such
a
good
person
as
she
.
 
<EOS>
That
was
a
silly
excuse
,
she
said
;
for
why
was
not
you
afraid
of
spirits
before
?
  
<EOS>
(
Indeed
I
did
not
think
of
that
.
)
 
<EOS>
But
you
shall
be
my
bed
-
fellow
with
all
my
heart
,
added
she
,
<EOS>
let
your
reason
be
what
it
will
;
only
come
down
to
supper
.
 
<EOS>
I
begged
to
be
excused
;
for
,
said
I
,
I
have
been
crying
so
,
that
it
will
be
taken
notice
of
by
my
fellow
-
servants
;
and
I
will
hide
nothing
from
you
,
Mrs.
Jervis
,
when
we
are
alone
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
so
good
to
indulge
me
;
but
made
haste
to
come
up
to
bed
;
and
told
the
servants
,
that
I
should
be
with
her
,
because
she
could
not
rest
well
,
and
would
get
me
to
read
her
to
sleep
;
for
she
knew
I
loved
reading
,
she
said
.
  
<EOS>
When
we
were
alone
,
I
told
her
all
that
had
passed
;
for
I
thought
,
though
he
had
bid
me
not
,
yet
if
he
should
come
to
know
I
had
told
,
it
would
be
no
worse
;
for
to
keep
a
secret
of
such
a
nature
,
would
be
,
as
I
apprehended
,
to
deprive
myself
of
the
good
advice
which
I
never
wanted
more
;
and
might
encourage
him
to
think
I
did
not
resent
it
as
I
ought
,
and
would
keep
worse
secrets
,
and
so
make
him
do
worse
by
me
.
 
<EOS>
Was
I
right
,
my
dear
mother
?
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jervis
could
not
help
mingling
tears
with
my
tears
;
for
I
cried
all
the
time
I
was
telling
her
the
story
,
and
begged
her
to
advise
me
what
to
do
;
and
I
shewed
her
my
dear
father
's
two
letters
,
and
she
praised
the
honesty
and
enditing
of
them
,
and
said
pleasing
things
to
me
of
you
both
.
<EOS>
But
she
begged
I
would
not
think
of
leaving
my
service
;
for
,
said
she
,
in
all
likelihood
,
you
behaved
so
virtuously
,
that
he
will
be
ashamed
of
what
he
has
done
,
and
never
offer
the
like
to
you
again
:
though
<EOS>
,
my
dear
Pamela
,
said
she
,
I
fear
more
for
your
prettiness
than
for
anything
else
;
because
the
best
man
in
the
land
might
love
you
:
so
she
was
pleased
to
say
.
 
<EOS>
She
wished
it
was
in
her
power
to
live
independent
;
then
she
would
take
a
little
private
house
,
and
I
should
live
with
her
like
her
daughter
.
  
<EOS>
And
so
,
as
you
ordered
me
to
take
her
advice
,
I
resolved
to
tarry
to
see
how
things
went
,
except
he
was
to
turn
me
away
;
although
,
in
your
first
letter
,
you
ordered
me
to
come
away
the
moment
I
had
any
reason
to
be
apprehensive
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
dear
father
and
mother
,
it
is
not
disobedience
,
I
hope
,
that
I
stay
;
for
I
could
not
expect
a
blessing
,
or
the
good
fruits
of
your
prayers
for
me
,
if
I
was
disobedient
.
  
<EOS>
All
the
next
day
I
was
very
sad
,
and
began
my
long
letter
.
 
<EOS>
He
saw
me
writing
,
and
said
(
as
I
mentioned
)
to
Mrs.
Jervis
,
That
girl
is
always
scribbling
;
<EOS>
methinks
she
might
find
something
else
to
do
,
or
to
that
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
And
when
I
had
finished
my
letter
,
I
put
it
under
the
toilet
in
my
late
lady
's
dressing
-
room
<EOS>
,
whither
nobody
comes
but
myself
and
Mrs.
Jervis
,
besides
my
master
;
but
when
I
came
up
again
to
seal
it
,
to
my
great
concern
,
it
was
gone
;
and
Mrs.
Jervis
knew
nothing
of
it
;
and
nobody
knew
of
my
master
's
having
been
near
the
place
in
the
time
;
so
I
have
been
sadly
troubled
about
it
:
But
Mrs.
Jervis
,
as
well
as
I
,
thinks
he
has
it
,
<EOS>
some
how
or
other
;
and
he
appears
cross
and
angry
,
and
seems
to
shun
me
,
as
much
as
he
said
I
did
him
.
 
<EOS>
It
had
better
be
so
than
worse
!
  
<EOS>
But
he
has
ordered
Mrs.
Jervis
to
bid
me
not
pass
so
much
time
in
writing
;
which
is
a
poor
matter
for
such
a
gentleman
as
he
to
take
notice
of
,
as
I
am
not
idle
other
ways
,
if
he
did
not
resent
what
he
thought
I
wrote
upon
.
 
<EOS>
And
this
has
no
very
good
look
.
  
<EOS>
But
I
am
a
good
deal
easier
since
I
lie
with
Mrs.
Jervis
;
though
,
after
all
,
the
fears
I
live
in
on
one
side
,
and
his
frowning
and
displeasure
at
what
I
do
on
the
other
,
make
me
more
miserable
than
enough
.
  
<EOS>
O
that
I
had
never
left
my
little
bed
in
the
loft
,
to
be
thus
exposed
to
temptations
on
one
hand
,
or
disgusts
on
the
other
!
 
<EOS>
How
happy
was
I
awhile
ago
!
 
<EOS>
How
contrary
now
!
 
<EOS>
Pity
and
pray
for
                                         
Your
afflicted
    
PAMELA
.
    
<EOS>
My
DEAREST
CHILD
,
  
<EOS>
Our
hearts
bleed
for
your
distress
,
and
the
temptations
you
are
exposed
to
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
our
hourly
prayers
;
and
we
would
have
you
flee
this
evil
great
house
and
man
,
if
you
find
he
renews
his
attempts
.
 
<EOS>
You
ought
to
have
done
it
at
first
,
had
you
not
had
Mrs.
Jervis
to
advise
with
.
 
<EOS>
We
can
find
no
fault
in
your
conduct
hitherto
:
<EOS>
But
it
makes
our
hearts
ache
for
fear
of
the
worst
.
 
<EOS>
O
my
child
!
<EOS>
temptations
are
sore
things
,
 
but
yet
,
without
them
,
we
know
not
ourselves
,
nor
what
we
are
able
to
do
.
  
<EOS>
Your
danger
is
very
great
;
for
you
have
riches
,
youth
,
and
a
fine
gentleman
,
as
the
world
reckons
him
,
to
withstand
;
but
how
great
will
be
your
honour
to
withstand
them
!
 
<EOS>
And
when
we
consider
your
past
conduct
,
and
your
virtuous
education
,
and
that
you
have
been
bred
to
be
more
ashamed
of
dishonesty
than
poverty
,
we
trust
in
God
,
that
He
will
enable
you
to
overcome
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
,
as
we
ca
n't
see
but
your
life
must
be
a
burthen
to
you
,
through
the
great
apprehensions
always
upon
you
;
and
that
it
may
be
presumptuous
to
trust
too
much
to
our
own
strength
;
and
that
you
are
but
very
young
;
and
the
devil
may
put
it
into
his
heart
to
use
some
stratagem
,
of
which
great
men
are
full
,
to
decoy
you
<EOS>
:
I
think
you
had
better
come
home
to
share
our
poverty
with
safety
,
than
live
with
so
much
discontent
in
a
plenty
,
that
itself
may
be
dangerous
.
 
<EOS>
God
direct
you
for
the
best
!
 
<EOS>
While
you
have
Mrs.
Jervis
for
an
adviser
and
bed
-
fellow
,
(
<EOS>
and
,
O
my
dear
child
!
<EOS>
that
was
prudently
done
of
you
,
)
<EOS>
we
are
easier
than
we
should
be
;
and
so
committing
you
to
the
divine
protection
,
remain
                            
<EOS>
Your
truly
loving
,
but
careful
,
                                                     
FATHER
and
MOTHER
.
    
<EOS>
DEAR
FATHER
AND
MOTHER
,
  
Mrs.
Jervis
and
I
have
lived
very
comfortably
together
for
this
fortnight
past
;
for
my
master
was
all
that
time
at
his
Lincolnshire
estate
,
and
at
his
sister
's
,
the
Lady
Davers
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
came
home
yesterday
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
some
talk
with
Mrs.
Jervis
soon
after
,
and
mostly
about
me
.
 
<EOS>
He
said
to
her
,
it
seems
,
Well
,
Mrs.
Jervis
,
I
know
Pamela
has
your
good
word
;
but
do
you
think
her
of
any
use
in
the
family
?
 
<EOS>
She
told
me
she
was
surprised
at
the
question
,
but
said
,
That
I
was
one
of
the
most
virtuous
and
industrious
young
creatures
that
ever
she
knew
.
 
<EOS>
Why
that
word
virtuous
,
said
he
,
I
pray
you
?
 
<EOS>
Was
there
any
reason
to
suppose
her
otherwise
?
 
<EOS>
Or
has
any
body
taken
it
into
his
head
to
try
her
?
 
<EOS>
I
wonder
,
sir
,
says
she
,
you
ask
such
a
question
!
 
<EOS>
Who
dare
offer
any
thing
to
her
in
such
an
orderly
and
well
-
governed
house
as
yours
,
and
under
a
master
of
so
good
a
character
for
virtue
and
honour
?
 
<EOS>
Your
servant
,
Mrs.
Jervis
,
says
he
,
for
your
good
opinion
:
but
pray
,
if
any
body
did
,
do
you
think
Pamela
would
let
you
know
it
?
 
<EOS>
Why
,
sir
,
said
she
,
she
is
a
poor
innocent
young
creature
,
and
I
believe
has
so
much
confidence
in
me
,
that
she
would
take
my
advice
as
soon
as
she
would
her
mother
's
.
 
<EOS>
Innocent
!
<EOS>
again
,
and
virtuous
,
I
warrant
!
 
<EOS>
Well
,
Mrs.
Jervis
,
you
abound
with
your
epithets
;
but
I
take
her
to
be
an
artful
young
baggage
;
and
had
I
a
young
handsome
butler
or
steward
,
she
'd
soon
make
her
market
of
one
of
them
,
if
she
thought
it
worth
while
to
snap
at
him
for
a
husband
.
 
<EOS>
Alack
-
a
-
day
,
sir
,
said
she
,
it
is
early
days
with
Pamela
;
and
she
does
not
yet
think
of
a
husband
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
:
and
your
steward
and
butler
are
both
men
in
years
,
and
think
nothing
of
the
matter
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
said
he
,
if
they
were
younger
,
they
'd
have
more
wit
than
to
think
of
such
a
girl
;
I
'll
tell
you
my
mind
of
her
,
Mrs.
Jervis
:
I
do
n't
think
this
same
favourite
of
yours
<EOS>
so
very
artless
<EOS>
a
girl
as
you
imagine
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
to
dispute
with
your
honour
,
said
Mrs.
Jervis
;
but
I
dare
say
,
if
the
men
will
let
her
alone
,
she
'll
never
trouble
herself
about
them
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
Mrs.
Jervis
,
said
he
,
are
there
any
men
that
will
not
let
her
alone
,
that
you
know
of
?
 
<EOS>
No
,
indeed
,
sir
,
said
she
;
she
keeps
herself
so
much
to
herself
,
and
yet
behaves
so
prudently
,
that
they
all
esteem
her
,
and
shew
her
as
great
a
respect
as
if
she
was
a
gentlewoman
born
.
  
<EOS>
Ay
,
says
he
,
that
's
her
art
,
that
I
was
speaking
of
:
<EOS>
but
,
let
me
tell
you
,
the
girl
has
vanity
and
conceit
,
and
pride
too
,
or
I
am
mistaken
;
and
,
perhaps
,
I
could
give
you
an
instance
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
said
she
,
you
can
see
farther
than
such
a
poor
silly
woman
as
I
am
;
but
I
never
saw
any
thing
but
innocence
in
her
 
And
virtue
too
<EOS>
,
I
'll
warrant
ye
!
<EOS>
said
he
.
<EOS>
But
suppose
I
could
give
you
an
instance
,
where
she
has
talked
a
little
too
freely
of
the
kindnesses
that
have
been
shewn
her
from
a
certain
quarter
;
and
has
had
the
vanity
to
impute
a
few
kind
words
,
uttered
in
mere
compassion
to
her
youth
and
circumstances
,
into
a
design
upon
her
,
and
even
dared
to
make
free
with
names
that
she
ought
never
to
mention
but
with
reverence
and
gratitude
;
what
would
you
say
to
that
?
 
<EOS>
Say
,
sir
!
<EOS>
said
she
,
I
can
not
tell
what
to
say
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
hope
Pamela
incapable
of
such
ingratitude
.
  
<EOS>
Well
,
no
more
of
this
silly
girl
,
says
he
;
<EOS>
you
may
only
advise
her
,
as
you
are
her
friend
,
not
to
give
herself
too
much
licence
upon
the
favours
she
meets
with
;
and
if
she
stays
here
,
that
she
will
not
write
the
affairs
of
my
family
purely
for
an
exercise
to
her
pen
,
and
her
invention
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
you
she
is
a
subtle
,
artful
gipsy
,
and
time
will
shew
it
you
.
  
<EOS>
Was
ever
the
like
heard
,
my
dear
father
and
mother
?
 
<EOS>
It
is
plain
he
did
not
expect
to
meet
with
such
a
repulse
,
and
mistrusts
that
I
have
told
Mrs.
Jervis
,
and
has
my
long
letter
too
,
that
I
intended
for
you
;
and
so
is
vexed
to
the
heart
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
ca
n't
help
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
better
be
thought
artful
and
subtle
,
than
be
so
,
in
his
sense
;
and
,
as
light
as
he
makes
of
the
words
virtue
and
innocence
in
me
,
he
would
have
made
a
less
angry
construction
,
had
I
less
deserved
that
he
should
do
so
;
for
then
,
may
be
,
my
crime
should
have
been
my
virtue
with
him
<EOS>
naughty
gentleman
as
he
is
!
  
<EOS>
I
will
soon
write
again
;
but
must
now
end
with
saying
,
that
I
am
,
and
shall
always
be
,
                     
Your
honest
DAUGHTER
.
    
<EOS>
DEAR
MOTHER
,
  
I
broke
off
abruptly
my
last
letter
;
for
I
feared
he
was
coming
;
and
so
it
happened
.
 
<EOS>
I
put
the
letter
in
my
bosom
,
and
took
up
my
work
,
which
lay
by
me
;
but
I
had
so
little
of
the
artful
,
as
he
called
it
,
that
I
looked
as
confused
as
if
I
had
been
doing
some
great
harm
.
  
<EOS>
Sit
still
,
Pamela
,
said
he
,
mind
your
work
,
for
all
me
.
 
<EOS>
You
do
n't
tell
me
I
am
welcome
home
,
after
my
journey
to
Lincolnshire
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
be
hard
,
sir
,
said
I
,
if
you
was
not
always
welcome
to
your
honour
's
own
house
.
  
<EOS>
I
would
have
gone
;
but
he
said
,
Do
n't
run
away
,
I
tell
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
word
or
two
to
say
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
Good
sirs
,
how
my
heart
went
pit
-
a
-
pat
!
 
<EOS>
When
I
was
a
little
kind
to
you
,
said
he
,
in
the
summer
-
house
,
and
you
carried
yourself
so
foolishly
upon
it
,
as
if
I
had
intended
to
do
you
great
harm
<EOS>
,
did
I
not
tell
you
you
should
take
no
notice
of
what
passed
to
any
creature
?
<EOS>
and
yet
you
have
made
a
common
talk
of
the
matter
,
not
considering
either
my
reputation
,
or
your
own
.
 
<EOS>
I
made
a
common
talk
of
it
,
sir
!
<EOS>
said
I
:
I
have
nobody
to
talk
to
,
hardly
.
  
<EOS>
He
interrupted
me
,
and
said
,
Hardly
!
<EOS>
you
little
equivocator
!
<EOS>
what
do
you
mean
by
hardly
?
 
<EOS>
Let
me
ask
you
,
have
not
you
told
Mrs.
Jervis
for
one
?
<EOS>
Pray
your
honour
,
said
I
,
all
in
agitation
,
let
me
go
down
;
for
it
is
not
for
me
to
hold
an
argument
with
your
honour
.
 
<EOS>
Equivocator
,
again
!
said
he
,
and
took
my
hand
,
what
do
you
talk
of
an
argument
?
 
<EOS>
Is
it
holding
an
argument
with
me
to
answer
a
plain
question
?
 
<EOS>
Answer
me
what
I
asked
.
 
<EOS>
O
,
good
sir
<EOS>
,
said
I
,
let
me
beg
you
will
not
urge
me
farther
,
for
fear
<EOS>
I
forget
myself
again
,
and
be
saucy
.
  
<EOS>
Answer
me
then
<EOS>
,
I
bid
you
,
says
he
,
Have
you
not
told
Mrs.
Jervis
?
 
<EOS>
It
will
be
saucy
in
you
if
you
do
n't
answer
me
directly
to
what
I
ask
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
said
I
,
and
fain
would
have
pulled
my
hand
away
<EOS>
,
perhaps
I
should
be
for
answering
you
by
another
question
,
and
that
would
not
become
me
.
 
<EOS>
What
is
it
you
would
say
?
<EOS>
replies
he
;
speak
out
.
  
<EOS>
Then
,
sir
,
said
I
,
why
should
your
honour
be
so
angry
I
should
tell
Mrs.
Jervis
,
or
any
body
else
,
what
passed
,
if
you
intended
no
harm
?
  
<EOS>
Well
said
,
pretty
innocent
and
artless
!
<EOS>
as
Mrs.
Jervis
calls
you
,
said
he
;
and
is
it
thus
you
taunt
and
retort
upon
me
,
insolent
as
you
are
!
<EOS>
But
still
I
will
be
answered
directly
to
my
question
.
 
<EOS>
Why
then
,
sir
,
said
I
,
I
will
not
tell
a
lie
for
the
world
:
I
did
tell
Mrs.
Jervis
;
for
my
heart
was
almost
broken
;
but
I
opened
not
my
mouth
to
any
other
.
 
<EOS>
Very
well
,
boldface
,
said
he
,
and
equivocator
again
!
 
<EOS>
You
did
not
open
your
mouth
to
any
other
;
but
did
not
you
write
to
some
other
?
 
<EOS>
Why
,
now
,
and
please
your
honour
,
said
I
,
(
for
I
was
quite
courageous
just
then
,
)
you
could
not
have
asked
me
this
question
,
if
you
had
not
taken
from
me
my
letter
to
my
father
and
mother
,
in
which
I
own
<EOS>
I
had
broken
my
mind
freely
to
them
,
and
asked
their
advice
,
and
poured
forth
my
griefs
!
  
<EOS>
And
so
I
am
to
be
exposed
,
am
I
,
<EOS>
said
he
,
in
my
own
house
,
and
out
of
my
house
,
to
the
whole
world
,
by
such
a
sauce
-
box
as
you
?
 
<EOS>
No
,
good
sir
,
said
I
,
and
I
hope
your
honour
wo
n't
be
angry
with
me
;
it
is
not
I
that
expose
you
,
if
I
say
nothing
but
the
truth
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
taunting
again
!
<EOS>
Assurance
as
you
are
!
<EOS>
said
he
:
I
will
not
be
thus
talked
to
!
  
<EOS>
Pray
,
sir
,
said
I
,
of
whom
can
a
poor
girl
take
advice
,
if
it
must
not
be
of
her
father
and
mother
,
and
such
a
good
woman
as
Mrs.
Jervis
,
who
,
for
her
sex
-
sake
,
should
give
it
me
when
asked
?
 
<EOS>
Insolence
!
<EOS>
said
he
,
and
stamped
with
his
foot
,
am
I
to
be
questioned
thus
by
such
a
one
as
you
?
<EOS>
I
fell
down
on
my
knees
,
and
said
,
For
Heaven
's
sake
,
your
honour
,
pity
a
poor
creature
,
that
knows
nothing
of
her
duty
,
but
how
to
cherish
her
virtue
and
good
name
:
I
have
nothing
else
to
trust
to
:
and
,
though
poor
and
friendless
here
,
yet
I
have
always
been
taught
to
value
honesty
above
my
life
.
 
<EOS>
Here
's
ado
with
your
honesty
,
said
he
,
foolish
girl
!
 
<EOS>
Is
it
not
one
part
of
honesty
to
be
dutiful
and
grateful
to
your
master
,
do
you
think
?
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
sir
,
said
I
,
it
is
impossible
I
should
be
ungrateful
to
your
honour
,
or
disobedient
,
or
deserve
the
names
of
bold
-
face
or
insolent
,
which
you
call
me
,
but
when
your
commands
are
contrary
to
that
first
duty
which
shall
ever
be
the
principle
of
my
life
!
  
<EOS>
He
seemed
to
be
moved
,
and
rose
up
,
and
walked
into
the
great
chamber
two
or
three
turns
,
leaving
me
on
my
knees
;
and
I
threw
my
apron
over
my
face
,
and
laid
my
head
on
a
chair
,
and
cried
as
if
my
heart
would
break
,
having
no
power
to
stir
.
  
<EOS>
At
last
he
came
in
again
,
but
,
alas
!
<EOS>
with
mischief
in
his
heart
!
<EOS>
and
raising
me
up
,
he
said
,
Rise
,
Pamela
,
rise
;
you
are
your
own
enemy
.
 
<EOS>
Your
perverse
folly
will
be
your
ruin
:
I
tell
you
this
,
that
I
am
very
much
displeased
with
the
freedoms
you
have
taken
with
my
name
to
my
housekeeper
,
as
also
to
your
father
and
mother
;
and
you
may
as
well
have
real
cause
to
take
these
freedoms
with
me
,
as
to
make
my
name
suffer
for
imaginary
ones
.
 
<EOS>
And
saying
so
,
he
offered
to
take
me
on
his
knee
,
with
some
force
.
 
<EOS>
O
how
I
was
terrified
!
 
<EOS>
I
said
,
like
as
I
had
read
in
a
book
a
night
or
two
before
,
Angels
and
saints
,
and
all
the
host
of
heaven
,
defend
me
!
 
<EOS>
And
may
I
never
survive
one
moment
<EOS>
that
fatal
one
in
which
I
shall
forfeit
my
innocence
!
 
<EOS>
Pretty
fool
!
<EOS>
said
he
,
how
will
you
forfeit
your
innocence
,
if
you
are
obliged
to
yield
to
a
force
you
can
not
withstand
?
 
<EOS>
Be
easy
,
said
he
;
for
let
the
worst
happen
that
can
,
you
will
have
the
merit
,
and
I
the
blame
;
and
it
will
be
a
good
subject
for
letters
to
your
father
and
mother
,
and
a
tale
into
the
bargain
for
Mrs.
Jervis
.
  
<EOS>
He
by
force
kissed
my
neck
and
lips
;
and
said
,
Whoever
blamed
Lucretia
?
<EOS>
All
the
shame
lay
on
the
ravisher
only
<EOS>
and
I
am
content
to
take
all
the
blame
upon
me
,
as
I
have
already
borne
too
great
a
share
for
what
I
have
not
deserved
.
  
<EOS>
May
I
,
said
I
,
Lucretia
like
,
justify
myself
with
my
death
,
if
I
am
used
barbarously
!
 
<EOS>
O
my
good
girl
!
<EOS>
said
he
,
tauntingly
,
you
are
well
read
,
I
see
;
and
we
shall
make
out
between
us
,
before
we
have
done
,
a
pretty
story
in
romance
,
I
warrant
ye
.
  
<EOS>
He
then
put
his
hand
in
my
bosom
,
and
indignation
gave
me
double
strength
,
and
I
got
loose
from
him
by
a
sudden
spring
,
and
ran
out
of
the
room
!
<EOS>
and
the
next
chamber
being
open
,
I
made
shift
to
get
into
it
,
and
threw
to
the
door
,
and
it
locked
after
me
;
but
he
followed
me
so
close
,
he
got
hold
of
my
gown
,
and
tore
a
piece
off
,
which
hung
without
the
door
;
for
the
key
was
on
the
inside
.
  
<EOS>
I
just
remember
I
got
into
the
room
;
for
I
knew
nothing
further
of
the
matter
till
afterwards
;
for
I
fell
into
a
fit
with
my
terror
,
and
there
I
lay
,
till
he
,
as
I
suppose
,
looking
through
the
key
-
hole
,
spyed
me
upon
the
floor
,
stretched
out
at
length
,
on
my
face
;
and
then
he
called
Mrs.
Jervis
to
me
,
who
,
by
his
assistance
,
bursting
open
the
door
<EOS>
,
he
went
away
,
seeing
me
coming
to
myself
;
and
bid
her
say
nothing
of
the
matter
,
if
she
was
wise
.
  
<EOS>
Poor
Mrs.
Jervis
thought
it
was
worse
,
and
cried
over
me
like
as
if
she
was
my
mother
;
and
I
was
two
hours
before
I
came
to
myself
;
and
just
as
I
got
a
little
up
on
my
feet
,
he
coming
in
,
I
fainted
away
again
with
the
terror
;
and
so
he
withdrew
:
<EOS>
but
he
staid
in
the
next
room
to
let
nobody
come
near
us
,
that
his
foul
proceedings
might
not
be
known
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jervis
gave
me
her
smelling
-
bottle
,
and
had
cut
my
laces
,
and
set
me
in
a
great
chair
,
and
he
called
her
to
him
:
<EOS>
How
is
the
girl
?
<EOS>
said
he
:
<EOS>
I
never
saw
such
a
fool
in
my
life
.
 
<EOS>
I
did
nothing
at
all
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jervis
could
not
speak
for
crying
.
 
<EOS>
So
he
said
,
She
has
told
you
,
it
seems
,
that
I
was
kind
to
her
in
the
summer
-
house
,
though
I
'll
assure
you
,
I
was
quite
innocent
then
as
well
as
now
;
and
I
desire
you
to
keep
this
matter
to
yourself
,
and
let
me
not
be
named
in
it
.
  
<EOS>
O
,
sir
,
said
she
,
for
your
honour
's
sake
,
and
for
Christ
's
sake
!
 
<EOS>
But
he
would
not
hear
her
,
and
said
 
For
your
own
sake
,
I
tell
you
,
Mrs.
Jervis
,
say
not
a
word
more
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
done
her
no
harm
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
wo
n't
have
her
stay
in
my
house
;
prating
,
perverse
fool
,
as
she
is
!
 
<EOS>
But
since
she
is
so
apt
to
fall
into
fits
,
or
at
least
pretend
to
do
so
,
prepare
her
to
see
me
to
-
morrow
after
dinner
,
in
my
mother
's
closet
,
and
do
you
be
with
her
,
and
you
shall
hear
what
passes
between
us
.
  
<EOS>
And
so
he
went
out
in
a
pet
,
and
ordered
his
chariot
and
four
to
be
got
ready
,
and
went
a
visiting
somewhere
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jervis
then
came
to
me
,
and
I
told
her
all
that
had
happened
,
and
said
,
I
was
resolved
not
to
stay
in
the
house
:
<EOS>
And
she
replying
<EOS>
,
He
seemed
to
threaten
as
much
;
I
said
,
I
am
glad
of
that
;
then
I
shall
be
easy
.
 
<EOS>
So
she
told
me
all
he
had
said
to
her
,
as
above
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jervis
is
very
loath
I
should
go
;
and
yet
,
poor
woman
!
<EOS>
she
begins
to
be
afraid
for
herself
;
but
would
not
have
me
ruined
for
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
She
says
to
be
sure
he
means
no
good
;
but
may
be
,
now
he
sees
me
so
resolute
,
he
will
give
over
all
attempts
;
and
that
I
shall
better
know
what
to
do
after
tomorrow
,
when
I
am
to
appear
before
a
very
bad
judge
,
I
doubt
.
  
<EOS>
O
how
I
dread
this
to
-
morrow
's
appearance
!
 
<EOS>
But
be
as
assured
,
<EOS>
my
dear
parents
,
of
the
honesty
of
your
poor
child
,
as
I
am
of
your
prayers
for
                                        
Your
dutiful
DAUGHTER
.
  
<EOS>
O
this
frightful
to
-
morrow
<EOS>
;
how
I
dread
it
!
    
<EOS>
MY
DEAR
PARENTS
,
  
<EOS>
I
know
you
longed
to
hear
from
me
soon
;
and
I
send
you
as
soon
as
I
could
.
  
<EOS>
Well
,
you
may
believe
how
uneasily
I
passed
the
time
,
till
his
appointed
hour
came
.
 
<EOS>
Every
minute
,
as
it
grew
nearer
,
my
terrors
increased
;
and
sometimes
I
had
great
courage
,
and
sometimes
none
at
all
;
and
I
thought
I
should
faint
when
it
came
to
the
time
my
master
had
dined
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
neither
eat
nor
drink
,
for
my
part
;
and
do
what
I
could
,
my
eyes
were
swelled
with
crying
.
  
<EOS>
At
last
he
went
up
to
the
closet
,
which
was
my
good
lady
's
dressing
-
room
;
a
room
I
once
loved
,
but
then
as
much
hated
.
  
<EOS>
Do
n't
your
heart
ache
for
me
?
 
<EOS>
I
am
sure
mine
fluttered
about
like
a
new
-
caught
bird
in
a
cage
.
 
<EOS>
O
Pamela
,
said
I
to
myself
,
why
art
thou
so
foolish
and
fearful
?
 
<EOS>
Thou
hast
done
no
harm
!
 
<EOS>
What
,
if
thou
fearest
an
unjust
judge
,
when
thou
art
innocent
,
would'st
thou
do
before
a
just
one
,
if
thou
wert
guilty
?
 
<EOS>
Have
courage
,
Pamela
,
thou
knowest
the
worst
!
 
<EOS>
And
how
easy
a
choice
poverty
and
honesty
is
,
rather
than
plenty
and
wickedness
.
  
<EOS>
So
I
cheered
myself
;
but
yet
my
poor
heart
sunk
,
and
my
spirits
were
quite
broken
.
 
<EOS>
Everything
that
stirred
<EOS>
,
I
thought
was
to
call
me
to
my
account
.
 
<EOS>
I
dreaded
it
,
and
yet
I
wished
it
to
come
.
  
<EOS>
Well
,
at
last
he
rung
the
bell
:
<EOS>
O
,
thought
I
,
that
it
was
my
passing
-
bell
!
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jervis
went
up
,
with
a
full
heart
enough
,
poor
good
woman
!
<EOS>
He
said
,
Where
's
Pamela
?
 
<EOS>
Let
her
come
up
,
and
do
you
come
with
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
came
to
me
:
I
was
ready
to
go
with
my
feet
;
but
my
heart
was
with
my
dear
father
and
mother
,
wishing
to
share
your
poverty
and
happiness
.
 
<EOS>
I
went
up
,
however
.
  
<EOS>
O
how
can
wicked
men
seem
so
steady
and
untouched
with
such
black
hearts
,
while
poor
innocents
stand
like
malefactors
before
them
!
  
<EOS>
He
looked
so
stern
,
that
my
heart
failed
me
,
and
I
wished
myself
any
<EOS>
where
but
there
,
though
I
had
before
been
summoning
up
all
my
courage
.
<EOS>
Good
Heaven
,
said
I
to
myself
,
give
me
courage
to
stand
before
this
naughty
master
!
 
<EOS>
O
soften
him
,
or
harden
me
!
  
<EOS>
Come
in
,
fool
,
said
he
,
angrily
,
as
soon
as
he
saw
me
;
(
and
snatched
my
hand
with
a
pull
;
)
you
may
well
be
ashamed
to
see
me
,
after
your
noise
and
nonsense
,
and
exposing
me
as
you
have
done
.
 
<EOS>
I
ashamed
to
see
you
!
<EOS>
thought
I
:
Very
pretty
indeed
!
 
<EOS>
But
I
said
nothing
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jervis
,
said
he
,
here
you
are
both
together
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
sit
down
;
but
let
her
stand
,
if
she
will
.
 
<EOS>
Ay
,
thought
I
,
if
I
can
;
for
my
knees
beat
one
against
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
Did
you
not
think
,
when
you
saw
the
girl
in
the
way
you
found
her
in
,
that
I
had
given
her
the
greatest
occasion
for
complaint
,
that
could
possibly
be
given
to
a
woman
?
 
<EOS>
And
that
I
had
actually
ruined
her
,
as
she
calls
it
?
 
<EOS>
Tell
me
,
could
you
think
any
thing
less
?
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
said
she
,
I
feared
so
at
first
.
 
<EOS>
Has
she
told
you
what
I
did
to
her
,
and
all
I
did
to
her
,
to
occasion
all
this
folly
,
by
which
my
reputation
might
have
suffered
in
your
opinion
,
and
in
that
of
all
the
family
.
 
<EOS>
Inform
me
,
what
she
has
told
you
?
  
<EOS>
She
was
a
little
too
much
frightened
,
as
she
owned
afterwards
,
at
his
sternness
,
and
said
,
<EOS>
Indeed
she
told
me
you
only
pulled
her
on
your
knee
,
and
kissed
her
.
  
<EOS>
Then
I
plucked
up
my
spirits
a
little
.
 
<EOS>
Only
!
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jervis
?
<EOS>
said
I
;
and
was
not
that
enough
to
shew
me
what
I
had
to
fear
?
 
<EOS>
When
a
master
of
his
honour
's
degree
demeans
himself
to
be
so
free
as
that
to
such
a
poor
servant
as
me
,
what
is
the
next
to
be
expected
?
 
<EOS>
But
your
honour
went
farther
,
so
you
did
;
and
threatened
me
what
you
would
do
,
and
talked
of
Lucretia
,
and
her
hard
fate
.
 
<EOS>
Your
honour
knows
you
went
too
far
for
a
master
to
a
servant
,
or
even
to
his
equal
;
and
I
can
not
bear
it
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
fell
a
crying
most
sadly
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jervis
began
to
excuse
me
,
and
to
beg
he
would
pity
a
poor
maiden
,
that
had
such
a
value
for
her
reputation
.
 
<EOS>
He
said
,
I
speak
it
to
her
face
,
I
think
her
very
pretty
,
and
I
thought
her
humble
,
and
one
that
would
not
grow
upon
my
favours
,
or
the
notice
I
took
of
her
;
but
I
abhor
the
thoughts
of
forcing
her
to
any
thing
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
myself
better
,
said
he
,
and
what
belongs
to
me
:
<EOS>
And
to
be
sure
I
have
enough
demeaned
myself
to
take
notice
of
such
a
one
as
she
;
but
I
was
bewitched
by
her
,
I
think
,
to
be
freer
than
became
me
;
though
I
had
no
intention
to
carry
the
jest
farther
.
  
<EOS>
What
poor
stuff
was
all
this
,
my
dear
mother
,
from
a
man
of
his
sense
!
<EOS>
But
see
how
a
bad
cause
and
bad
actions
confound
the
greatest
wits
!
 
<EOS>
It
gave
me
a
little
more
courage
then
;
for
innocence
,
I
find
,
in
a
low
fortune
,
and
weak
mind
,
has
many
advantages
over
guilt
,
with
all
its
riches
and
wisdom
.
  
<EOS>
So
I
said
,
Your
honour
may
call
this
jest
or
sport
,
or
what
you
please
;
but
indeed
,
sir
,
it
is
not
a
jest
that
becomes
the
distance
between
a
master
and
a
servant
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
hear
,
Mrs.
Jervis
?
<EOS>
said
he
:
do
you
hear
the
pertness
of
the
creature
?
 
<EOS>
I
had
a
good
deal
of
this
sort
before
in
the
summer
-
house
,
and
yesterday
too
,
which
made
me
rougher
with
her
than
perhaps
<EOS>
I
had
otherwise
been
.
  
<EOS>
Says
Mrs.
Jervis
,
Pamela
,
do
n't
be
so
pert
to
his
honour
:
<EOS>
you
should
know
your
distance
;
you
see
his
honour
was
only
in
jest
.
 
<EOS>
O
dear
Mrs.
Jervis
,
said
I
,
do
n't
you
blame
me
too
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
very
difficult
to
keep
one
's
distance
to
the
greatest
of
men
,
when
they
wo
n't
keep
it
themselves
to
their
meanest
servants
.
  
<EOS>
See
again
!
<EOS>
said
he
;
could
you
believe
this
of
the
young
baggage
,
if
you
had
not
heard
it
?
 
<EOS>
Good
your
honour
<EOS>
,
said
the
well
-
meaning
gentlewoman
,
pity
and
forgive
the
poor
girl
;
she
is
but
a
girl
,
and
her
virtue
is
very
dear
to
her
;
and
I
will
pawn
my
life
for
her
<EOS>
,
she
will
never
be
pert
to
your
honour
,
if
you
'll
be
so
good
as
to
molest
her
no
more
,
nor
frighten
her
again
.
 
<EOS>
You
saw
,
sir
,
by
her
fit
,
she
was
in
terror
;
she
could
not
help
it
;
and
though
your
honour
intended
her
no
harm
,
yet
the
apprehension
was
almost
death
to
her
:
and
I
had
much
ado
to
bring
her
to
herself
again
.
 
<EOS>
O
the
little
hypocrite
!
<EOS>
said
he
<EOS>
;
she
has
all
the
arts
of
her
sex
;
they
were
born
with
her
;
and
I
told
you
awhile
ago
you
did
not
know
her
.
 
<EOS>
But
this
was
not
the
reason
principally
of
my
calling
you
before
me
together
.
 
<EOS>
I
find
I
am
likely
to
suffer
in
my
reputation
by
the
perverseness
and
folly
of
this
girl
.
 
<EOS>
She
has
told
you
all
,
and
perhaps
more
than
all
;
nay
,
I
make
no
doubt
of
it
;
and
she
has
written
letters
(
for
I
find
she
is
a
mighty
letter
-
writer
!
)
<EOS>
to
her
father
and
mother
,
and
others
,
as
far
as
I
know
,
in
which
representing
herself
as
an
angel
of
light
,
she
makes
her
kind
master
and
benefactor
,
a
devil
incarnate
(
<EOS>
O
how
people
will
sometimes
,
thought
I
,
call
themselves
by
their
right
names
!
)
 
<EOS>
And
all
this
,
added
he
,
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
hear
;
and
<EOS>
so
I
am
resolved
she
shall
return
to
the
distresses
and
poverty
she
was
taken
from
;
and
let
her
be
careful
how
she
uses
my
name
with
freedom
,
when
she
is
gone
from
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
brightened
up
at
once
with
these
welcome
words
,
and
I
threw
myself
upon
my
knees
at
his
feet
,
with
a
most
sincere
glad
heart
;
and
I
said
,
May
<EOS>
your
honour
be
for
ever
blessed
for
your
resolution
!
 
<EOS>
Now
I
shall
be
happy
.
 
<EOS>
And
permit
me
,
on
my
bended
knees
,
to
thank
you
for
all
the
benefits
and
favours
you
have
heaped
upon
me
;
for
the
opportunities
I
have
had
of
improvement
and
learning
,
through
my
good
lady
's
means
,
and
yours
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
now
forget
all
your
honour
has
offered
me
:
and
I
promise
you
,
that
I
will
never
let
your
name
pass
my
lips
,
but
with
reverence
and
gratitude
:
<EOS>
and
so
God
Almighty
bless
your
honour
,
for
ever
and
ever
!
<EOS>
Amen
.
  
<EOS>
Then
rising
from
my
knees
,
I
went
away
with
another
-
guise
sort
of
heart
than
I
came
into
his
presence
with
:
<EOS>
and
so
I
fell
to
writing
this
letter
.
<EOS>
And
thus
all
is
happily
over
.
  
<EOS>
And
now
,
my
dearest
father
and
mother
,
expect
to
see
soon
your
poor
daughter
,
with
an
humble
and
dutiful
mind
,
<EOS>
returned
to
you
:
and
do
n't
fear
<EOS>
but
I
know
how
to
be
as
happy
with
you
as
ever
:
for
I
will
be
in
the
loft
,
as
I
used
to
do
;
and
pray
let
my
little
bed
be
got
ready
;
and
I
have
a
small
matter
of
money
,
which
will
buy
me
a
suit
of
clothes
,
fitter
for
my
condition
than
what
I
have
;
and
I
will
get
Mrs.
Mumford
to
help
me
to
some
needle
-
work
:
and
fear
not
that
I
shall
be
a
burden
to
you
,
if
my
health
continues
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
I
shall
be
blessed
,
if
not
for
my
own
sake
,
for
both
your
sakes
,
who
have
,
in
all
your
trials
and
misfortunes
,
preserved
so
much
integrity
as
makes
every
body
speak
well
of
you
both
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
hope
he
will
let
good
Mrs.
Jervis
give
me
a
character
,
<EOS>
for
fear
it
should
be
thought
that
I
was
turned
away
for
dishonesty
.
  
<EOS>
And
so
,
my
dear
parents
,
may
you
be
blest
for
me
,
and
I
for
you
!
 
<EOS>
And
I
will
always
pray
for
my
master
and
Mrs.
Jervis
.
 
<EOS>
So
good
night
;
for
it
is
late
,
and
I
shall
be
soon
called
to
bed
.
  
<EOS>
I
hope
Mrs.
Jervis
is
not
angry
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
She
has
not
called
me
to
supper
:
though
I
could
eat
nothing
if
she
had
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
make
no
doubt
I
shall
sleep
purely
to
-
night
,
and
dream
that
I
am
with
you
,
in
my
dear
,
dear
,
happy
loft
once
more
.
  
<EOS>
So
good
night
again
,
my
dear
father
and
mother
,
says
                                          
Your
poor
honest
DAUGHTER
.
  
<EOS>
Perhaps
I
may
n't
come
this
week
,
because
I
must
get
up
the
linen
,
and
leave
in
order
every
thing
belonging
to
my
place
.
 
<EOS>
So
send
me
a
line
,
if
you
can
,
to
let
me
know
if
I
shall
be
welcome
,
by
John
,
who
will
call
for
it
as
he
returns
.
 
<EOS>
But
say
nothing
of
my
coming
away
to
him
,
as
yet
:
for
it
will
be
said
I
blab
every
thing
.
    
<EOS>
MY
DEAREST
DAUGHTER
,
  
Welcome
,
<EOS>
welcome
,
<EOS>
ten
times
welcome
<EOS>
shall
you
be
to
us
;
for
you
come
to
us
innocent
,
and
happy
,
and
honest
;
and
you
are
the
staff
of
our
old
age
,
and
our
comfort
.
 
<EOS>
And
though
we
can
not
do
for
you
as
we
would
,
yet
,
fear
not
,
we
shall
live
happily
together
;
and
what
with
my
diligent
labour
,
and
your
poor
mother
's
spinning
,
and
your
needle
-
work
,
I
make
no
doubt
we
shall
do
better
and
better
.
 
<EOS>
Only
your
poor
mother
's
eyes
begin
to
fail
her
;
though
,
I
bless
God
,
I
am
as
strong
and
able
,
and
willing
to
labour
as
ever
;
and
,
O
my
dear
child
!
<EOS>
your
virtue
has
made
me
,
I
think
,
stronger
and
better
than
I
was
before
.
 
<EOS>
What
blessed
things
are
trials
and
temptations
,
when
we
have
the
strength
to
resist
and
subdue
them
!
  
<EOS>
But
I
am
uneasy
about
those
same
four
guineas
;
I
think
you
should
give
them
back
again
to
your
master
;
and
yet
I
have
broken
them
.
 
<EOS>
Alas
!
<EOS>
I
have
only
three
left
;
but
I
will
borrow
the
fourth
,
if
I
can
,
part
upon
my
wages
,
and
part
of
Mrs.
Mumford
,
and
send
the
whole
sum
back
to
you
,
that
you
may
return
it
,
against
John
<EOS>
comes
next
,
if
he
comes
again
before
you
.
  
<EOS>
I
want
to
know
how
you
come
.
 
<EOS>
I
fancy
honest
John
will
be
glad
to
bear
you
company
part
of
the
way
,
if
your
master
is
not
so
cross
as
to
forbid
him
.
 
<EOS>
And
if
I
know
time
enough
,
your
mother
will
go
one
five
miles
,
and
I
will
go
ten
on
the
way
,
or
till
I
meet
you
,
as
far
as
one
holiday
will
go
;
for
that
I
can
get
leave
to
make
on
such
an
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
And
we
shall
receive
you
with
more
pleasure
than
we
had
at
your
birth
,
when
all
the
worst
was
over
;
or
than
we
ever
had
in
our
lives
.
  
<EOS>
And
so
God
bless
you
till
the
happy
time
comes
!
<EOS>
say
both
your
mother
and
I
,
which
is
all
at
present
,
from
                               
Your
truly
loving
PARENTS
.
    
<EOS>
DEAR
FATHER
AND
MOTHER
,
  
I
thank
you
a
thousand
tines
for
your
goodness
to
me
,
expressed
in
your
last
letter
.
 
<EOS>
I
now
long
to
get
my
business
done
,
and
come
to
my
new
old
lot
again
,
as
I
may
call
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
quite
another
thing
since
my
master
has
turned
me
off
:
and
as
I
shall
come
to
you
an
honest
daughter
,
what
pleasure
it
is
to
what
I
should
have
had
,
if
I
could
not
have
seen
you
but
as
a
guilty
one
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
my
writing
-
time
will
soon
be
over
,
and
so
I
will
make
use
of
it
now
,
and
tell
you
all
that
has
happened
since
my
last
letter
.
  
<EOS>
I
wondered
Mrs.
Jervis
did
not
call
me
to
sup
with
her
,
and
feared
she
was
angry
;
and
when
I
had
finished
my
letter
,
I
longed
for
her
coming
to
bed
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
she
came
up
,
but
seemed
shy
and
reserved
;
and
I
said
,
My
dear
Mrs.
Jervis
,
I
am
glad
to
see
you
:
you
are
not
angry
with
me
,
I
hope
.
 
<EOS>
She
said
she
was
sorry
things
had
gone
so
far
;
and
that
she
had
a
great
deal
of
talk
with
my
master
,
after
I
was
gone
;
that
he
seemed
moved
at
what
I
said
,
and
at
my
falling
on
my
knees
to
him
,
and
my
prayer
for
him
,
at
my
going
away
.
 
<EOS>
He
said
I
was
a
strange
girl
;
he
knew
not
what
to
make
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
And
is
she
gone
?
<EOS>
said
he
:
<EOS>
I
intended
to
say
something
else
to
her
;
but
she
behaved
so
oddly
,
that
I
had
not
power
to
stop
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
asked
,
if
she
should
call
me
again
?
 
<EOS>
He
said
,
Yes
;
<EOS>
and
then
,
No
,
let
her
go
;
it
is
best
for
her
and
me
too
;
and
she
shall
go
,
now
I
have
given
her
warning
.
 
<EOS>
Where
she
had
it
,
I
ca
n't
tell
;
but
I
never
met
with
the
fellow
of
her
in
any
life
,
at
any
age
.
 
<EOS>
She
said
,
he
had
ordered
her
not
to
tell
me
all
:
<EOS>
but
she
believed
he
would
never
offer
any
thing
to
me
again
;
and
I
might
stay
,
she
fancied
,
if
I
would
beg
it
as
a
favour
;
though
she
was
not
sure
neither
.
  
<EOS>
I
stay
!
<EOS>
dear
Mrs.
Jervis
;
said
I
;
why
it
is
the
best
news
that
could
have
come
to
me
,
that
he
will
let
me
go
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
nothing
but
long
to
go
back
again
to
my
poverty
and
distress
,
as
he
threatened
I
should
;
for
though
I
am
sure
of
the
poverty
<EOS>
,
I
shall
not
have
half
the
distress
I
have
had
for
some
months
past
,
I
'll
assure
you
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jervis
,
dear
good
soul
!
<EOS>
wept
over
me
,
and
said
,
<EOS>
Well
,
well
,
Pamela
,
I
did
not
think
I
had
shewn
so
little
love
to
you
,
as
that
you
should
express
so
much
joy
upon
leaving
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
sure
I
never
had
a
child
half
so
dear
to
me
as
you
are
.
  
<EOS>
I
went
to
hear
her
so
good
to
me
,
as
indeed
she
has
always
been
,
and
said
,
What
would
you
have
me
to
do
,
dear
Mrs.
Jervis
?
 
<EOS>
I
love
you
next
to
my
own
father
and
mother
,
and
to
leave
you
is
the
chief
concern
I
have
at
quitting
this
place
;
but
I
am
sure
it
is
certain
ruin
if
I
stay
.
 
<EOS>
After
such
offers
,
and
such
threatenings
,
and
his
comparing
himself
to
a
wicked
ravisher
in
the
very
time
of
his
last
offer
;
and
turning
it
into
a
jest
,
that
we
should
make
a
pretty
story
in
a
romance
;
can
I
stay
and
be
safe
?
<EOS>
Has
he
not
demeaned
himself
twice
?
 
<EOS>
And
it
behoves
me
to
beware
of
the
third
time
,
for
fear
he
should
lay
his
snares
surer
;
for
perhaps
he
did
not
expect
a
poor
servant
would
resist
her
master
so
much
.
 
<EOS>
And
must
it
not
be
looked
upon
as
a
sort
of
warrant
for
such
actions
,
if
I
stay
after
this
?
 
<EOS>
For
,
I
think
,
when
one
of
our
sex
finds
she
is
attempted
,
it
is
an
encouragement
to
the
attempter
to
proceed
,
if
one
puts
one
's
self
in
the
way
of
it
,
when
one
can
help
it
:
'
Tis
neither
more
nor
less
than
inviting
him
to
think
that
one
forgives
,
what
,
in
short
,
ought
not
to
be
forgiven
:
Which
is
no
small
countenance
to
foul
actions
,
I
'll
assure
you
.
  
<EOS>
She
hugged
me
to
her
,
and
said
I
'll
assure
you
!
<EOS>
Pretty
-
face
,
where
gottest
thou
all
thy
knowledge
,
and
thy
good
notions
,
at
these
years
?
<EOS>
Thou
art
a
miracle
for
thy
age
,
and
I
shall
always
love
thee
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
do
you
resolve
to
leave
us
,
Pamela
?
  
<EOS>
Yes
,
my
dear
Mrs.
Jervis
,
said
I
;
for
,
as
matters
stand
,
how
can
I
do
otherwise
?
 
<EOS>
But
I
'll
finish
the
duties
of
my
place
first
,
if
I
may
;
and
hope
you
'll
give
me
a
character
,
as
to
my
honesty
,
that
it
may
not
he
thought
I
was
turned
away
for
any
harm
.
 
<EOS>
Ay
,
that
I
will
,
said
she
;
I
will
give
thee
such
a
character
as
never
girl
at
thy
years
deserved
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
am
sure
<EOS>
,
said
I
,
I
will
always
love
and
honour
you
,
as
my
third
-
best
friend
,
wherever
I
go
,
or
whatever
becomes
of
me
.
  
<EOS>
And
so
we
went
to
bed
;
and
I
never
waked
till
'
twas
time
to
rise
;
which
I
did
as
blithe
as
a
bird
,
and
went
about
my
business
with
great
pleasure
.
  
<EOS>
But
I
believe
my
master
is
fearfully
angry
with
me
;
for
he
passed
by
me
two
or
three
times
,
and
would
not
speak
to
me
;
and
towards
evening
,
he
met
me
in
the
passage
,
going
into
the
garden
,
and
said
such
a
word
to
me
as
I
never
heard
in
my
life
from
him
to
man
,
woman
,
or
child
;
for
he
first
said
,
This
creature
's
always
in
the
way
,
I
think
.
 
<EOS>
I
said
,
standing
up
as
close
as
I
could
,
(
and
the
entry
was
wide
enough
for
a
coach
too
,
)
<EOS>
I
hope
I
sha
n't
be
long
in
your
honour
's
way
.
 
<EOS>
D
 
mn
you
!
<EOS>
said
he
,
(
that
was
the
hard
word
,
)
for
a
little
witch
;
I
have
no
patience
with
you
.
  
<EOS>
I
profess
I
trembled
to
hear
him
say
so
<EOS>
;
but
I
saw
he
was
vexed
;
and
,
as
I
am
going
away
,
I
minded
it
the
less
.
 
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
I
see
,
<EOS>
my
dear
parents
,
that
when
a
person
will
do
wicked
things
,
it
is
no
wonder
he
will
speak
wicked
words
.
 
<EOS>
May
God
keep
me
out
of
the
way
of
them
both
!
                                            
<EOS>
Your
dutiful
DAUGHTER
.
    
<EOS>
DEAR
FATHER
AND
MOTHER
,
  
<EOS>
Our
John
having
an
opportunity
to
go
your
way
,
I
write
again
,
and
send
both
letters
at
once
.
 
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
say
,
yet
,
when
I
shall
get
away
,
nor
how
I
shall
come
,
because
Mrs.
Jervis
shewed
my
master
the
waistcoat
I
am
flowering
for
him
,
and
he
said
,
It
looks
well
enough
:
I
think
the
creature
had
best
stay
till
she
has
finished
it
.
  
<EOS>
There
is
some
private
talk
carried
on
betwixt
him
and
Mrs.
Jervis
,
that
she
do
n't
tell
me
of
;
but
yet
she
is
very
kind
to
me
,
and
I
do
n't
mistrust
her
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
be
very
base
if
I
did
.
 
<EOS>
But
to
be
sure
she
must
oblige
him
,
and
keep
all
his
lawful
commands
;
and
other
,
I
dare
say
,
she
wo
n't
keep
:
<EOS>
She
is
too
good
;
and
loves
me
too
well
;
but
she
must
stay
when
I
am
gone
,
and
so
must
get
no
ill
will
.
  
<EOS>
She
has
been
at
me
again
to
ask
to
stay
,
and
humble
myself
.
 
<EOS>
But
what
have
I
done
,
Mrs.
Jervis
?
<EOS>
said
I
:
If
I
have
been
a
sauce
-
box
,
and
a
bold
-
face
,
and
a
pert
,
and
a
creature
,
as
he
calls
me
,
have
I
not
had
reason
?
<EOS>
Do
you
think
I
should
ever
have
forgot
myself
,
if
he
had
not
forgot
to
act
as
my
master
?
 
<EOS>
Tell
me
from
your
own
heart
,
dear
Mrs.
Jervis
,
said
I
,
if
you
think
I
could
stay
and
be
safe
:
What
would
you
think
,
or
how
would
you
act
in
my
case
?
  
<EOS>
My
dear
Pamela
,
said
she
,
and
kissed
me
<EOS>
,
I
do
n't
know
how
I
should
act
,
or
what
I
should
think
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
I
should
act
as
you
do
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
know
nobody
else
that
would
.
 
<EOS>
My
master
is
a
fine
gentleman
;
he
has
a
great
deal
of
wit
and
sense
,
and
is
admired
,
as
I
know
,
by
half
a
dozen
ladies
,
who
would
think
themselves
happy
in
his
addresses
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
a
noble
estate
;
and
yet
I
believe
he
loves
my
good
maiden
,
though
his
servant
,
better
than
all
the
ladies
in
the
land
;
and
he
has
tried
to
overcome
it
,
because
you
are
so
much
his
inferior
;
and
'
tis
my
opinion
<EOS>
he
finds
he
ca
n't
;
and
that
vexes
his
proud
heart
,
and
makes
him
resolve
you
sha
n't
stay
;
and
so
he
speaks
<EOS>
so
cross
to
you
,
when
he
sees
you
by
accident
.
  
<EOS>
Well
,
but
,
Mrs.
Jervis
,
said
I
,
let
me
ask
you
,
if
he
can
stoop
to
like
such
a
poor
girl
as
me
,
as
perhaps
he
may
,
(
for
I
have
read
of
things
almost
as
strange
,
from
great
men
to
poor
damsels
,
)
<EOS>
What
can
it
be
for
?
  
<EOS>
He
may
condescend
,
perhaps
,
to
think
I
may
be
good
enough
for
his
harlot
;
and
those
things
do
n't
disgrace
men
that
ruin
poor
women
,
as
the
world
goes
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
if
I
was
wicked
enough
,
he
would
keep
me
till
I
was
undone
,
and
till
his
mind
changed
;
for
even
wicked
men
,
I
have
read
,
soon
grow
weary
of
wickedness
with
the
same
person
,
and
love
variety
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
then
,
poor
Pamela
must
be
turned
off
,
and
looked
upon
as
a
vile
abandoned
creature
,
and
every
body
would
despise
her
;
ay
,
and
justly
too
,
Mrs.
Jervis
;
for
she
that
ca
n't
keep
her
virtue
,
ought
to
live
in
disgrace
.
  
<EOS>
But
,
Mrs.
Jervis
,
I
continued
,
let
me
tell
you
,
that
I
hope
,
if
I
was
sure
he
would
always
be
kind
to
me
,
and
never
turn
me
off
at
all
,
that
I
shall
have
so
much
grace
,
as
to
hate
and
withstand
his
temptations
,
were
he
not
only
my
master
,
but
my
king
:
and
that
for
the
sin
's
sake
.
 
<EOS>
This
my
poor
dear
parents
have
always
taught
me
;
and
I
should
be
a
sad
wicked
creature
indeed
,
if
,
for
the
sake
of
riches
or
favour
,
I
should
forfeit
my
good
name
;
yea
,
and
worse
than
any
other
young
body
of
my
sex
;
because
I
can
so
contentedly
return
to
my
poverty
again
,
and
think
it
a
less
disgrace
to
be
obliged
to
wear
rags
,
and
live
upon
rye
-
bread
and
water
,
as
I
used
to
do
,
than
to
be
a
harlot
to
the
greatest
man
in
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jervis
lifted
up
her
hands
,
and
had
her
eyes
full
of
tears
.
 
<EOS>
God
bless
you
,
my
dear
love
!
<EOS>
said
she
;
you
are
my
admiration
and
delight
.
  
<EOS>
How
shall
I
do
to
part
with
you
!
  
<EOS>
Well
,
good
Mrs.
Jervis
,
said
I
,
let
me
ask
you
now
:
 
You
and
<EOS>
he
have
had
some
talk
,
and
you
may
n't
be
suffered
to
tell
me
all
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
do
you
think
,
if
I
was
to
ask
to
stay
,
that
he
is
sorry
for
what
he
has
done
?
 
<EOS>
Ay
,
and
ashamed
of
it
too
?
 
<EOS>
For
I
am
sure
he
ought
,
considering
his
high
degree
,
and
my
low
degree
,
and
how
I
have
nothing
in
the
world
to
trust
to
<EOS>
but
my
honesty
:
<EOS>
Do
you
think
in
your
own
conscience
now
,
(
pray
answer
me
truly
,
)
<EOS>
that
he
would
never
offer
any
thing
to
me
again
,
and
that
I
could
be
safe
?
  
<EOS>
Alas
!
<EOS>
my
dear
child
,
said
she
,
do
n't
put
thy
home
questions
to
me
,
with
that
pretty
becoming
earnestness
in
thy
look
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
this
,
that
he
is
vexed
at
what
he
has
done
;
he
was
vexed
the
first
time
,
more
vexed
the
second
time
.
  
<EOS>
Yes
,
said
I
,
and
so
he
will
be
vexed
,
I
suppose
,
the
third
,
and
the
fourth
time
too
,
till
he
has
quite
ruined
your
poor
maiden
;
and
who
will
have
cause
to
be
vexed
then
?
  
<EOS>
Nay
,
Pamela
,
said
she
,
do
n't
imagine
that
I
would
be
accessory
to
your
ruin
for
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
I
only
can
say
,
that
he
has
,
yet
,
done
you
no
hurt
;
and
it
is
no
wonder
he
should
love
you
<EOS>
,
you
are
so
pretty
;
though
so
much
beneath
him
<EOS>
but
,
I
dare
swear
for
him
,
he
never
will
offer
you
any
force
.
  
<EOS>
You
say
,
said
I
,
that
he
was
sorry
for
his
first
offer
in
the
summer
-
house
.
<EOS>
Well
,
and
how
long
did
his
sorrow
last
?
 
<EOS>
Only
till
he
found
me
by
myself
;
and
then
he
was
worse
than
before
:
and
so
became
sorry
again
.
<EOS>
And
if
he
has
deigned
to
love
me
,
and
you
say
ca
n't
help
it
,
why
,
he
ca
n't
help
it
neither
,
if
he
should
have
an
opportunity
,
a
third
time
to
distress
me
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
have
read
that
many
a
man
has
been
ashamed
of
his
wicked
attempts
,
when
he
has
been
repulsed
,
that
would
never
have
been
ashamed
of
them
,
had
he
succeeded
.
 
<EOS>
Besides
,
Mrs.
Jervis
,
if
he
really
intends
to
offer
no
force
,
What
does
that
mean
?
 
<EOS>
While
you
say
he
ca
n't
help
liking
me
,
for
love
it
can
not
be
 
<EOS>
Does
it
not
imply
that
he
hopes
to
ruin
me
by
my
own
consent
?
 
<EOS>
I
think
,
said
I
,
(
<EOS>
and
hope
I
should
have
grace
to
do
so
,
)
that
I
should
not
give
way
to
his
temptations
on
any
account
;
but
it
would
be
very
presumptuous
in
me
to
rely
upon
my
own
strength
against
a
gentleman
of
his
qualifications
and
estate
,
and
who
is
my
waster
;
and
thinks
himself
entitled
to
call
me
bold
-
face
,
and
what
not
?
<EOS>
only
for
standing
on
my
necessary
defence
:
and
that
,
too
,
where
the
good
of
my
soul
and
body
,
and
my
duty
to
God
,
and
my
parents
,
are
all
concerned
.
 
<EOS>
How
then
,
Mrs.
Jervis
,
said
I
,
can
I
ask
or
wish
to
stay
?
  
<EOS>
Well
,
well
,
says
she
;
as
he
seems
very
desirous
you
should
not
stay
,
I
hope
it
is
from
a
good
motive
;
for
fear
he
should
be
tempted
to
disgrace
himself
as
well
as
you
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
no
,
Mrs.
Jervis
,
said
I
;
I
have
thought
of
that
too
;
for
I
would
be
glad
to
consider
him
with
that
duty
that
becomes
me
:
<EOS>
but
then
he
would
have
let
me
go
to
Lady
Davers
,
and
not
have
hindered
my
preferment
:
and
he
would
not
have
said
,
I
should
return
to
my
poverty
and
distress
,
when
,
by
his
mother
's
goodness
,
I
had
been
lifted
out
of
it
;
but
that
he
intended
to
fright
me
,
and
punish
me
,
as
he
thought
,
for
not
complying
with
his
wickedness
:
<EOS>
And
this
shews
me
<EOS>
well
enough
what
I
have
to
expect
from
his
future
goodness
,
except
I
will
deserve
it
at
his
own
dear
price
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
silent
;
and
I
added
,
<EOS>
Well
,
there
's
no
more
to
be
said
;
I
must
go
<EOS>
,
that
's
certain
:
All
my
concern
will
be
how
to
part
with
you
:
and
,
indeed
,
after
you
,
with
every
body
;
for
all
my
fellow
-
servants
have
loved
me
,
and
you
and
they
will
cost
me
a
sigh
,
and
a
tear
too
,
now
and
then
,
I
am
sure
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
I
fell
a
crying
:
<EOS>
I
could
not
help
it
.
 
<EOS>
For
it
is
a
pleasant
thing
to
one
to
be
in
a
house
among
a
great
many
fellow
-
servants
,
and
be
beloved
by
them
all
.
  
<EOS>
Nay
,
I
should
have
told
you
before
now
,
how
kind
and
civil
Mr.
Longman
our
steward
is
;
vastly
courteous
,
indeed
,
on
all
occasions
!
 
<EOS>
And
he
said
once
to
Mrs.
Jervis
<EOS>
,
he
wished
he
was
a
young
man
for
my
sake
;
I
should
be
his
wife
,
and
he
would
settle
all
he
had
upon
me
on
marriage
;
and
,
you
must
know
,
he
is
reckoned
worth
a
power
of
money
.
  
<EOS>
I
take
no
pride
in
this
;
but
bless
God
,
and
your
good
examples
,
my
dear
parents
,
that
I
have
been
enabled
so
to
carry
myself
,
as
to
have
every
body
's
good
word
;
<EOS>
Not
but
our
cook
one
day
,
who
is
a
little
snappish
and
cross
sometimes
,
said
once
to
me
,
Why
this
Pamela
of
ours
goes
as
fine
as
a
lady
.
 
<EOS>
See
what
it
is
to
have
a
fine
face
!
 
<EOS>
I
wonder
what
the
girl
will
come
to
at
last
!
  
<EOS>
She
was
hot
with
her
work
;
and
I
sneaked
away
;
for
I
seldom
go
down
into
the
kitchen
;
and
I
heard
the
butler
say
,
Why
,
Jane
,
nobody
has
your
good
word
:
What
has
Mrs.
Pamela
done
to
you
?
 
<EOS>
I
am
sure
she
offends
nobody
.
<EOS>
And
what
,
said
the
peevish
wench
,
have
I
said
to
her
,
foolatum
;
but
that
she
was
pretty
?
 
<EOS>
They
quarrelled
afterwards
<EOS>
,
I
heard
:
<EOS>
I
was
sorry
for
it
,
but
troubled
myself
no
more
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
Forgive
this
silly
prattle
,
from
                                            
Your
dutiful
DAUGHTER
.
  
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
I
forgot
to
say
,
that
I
would
stay
to
finish
the
waistcoat
,
if
I
might
with
safety
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jervis
tells
me
I
certainly
may
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
did
a
prettier
piece
of
work
;
and
I
am
up
early
and
late
to
get
it
over
;
for
I
long
to
be
with
you
.
    
<EOS>
DEAR
FATHER
AND
MOTHER
,
  
I
did
not
send
my
last
letters
so
soon
as
I
hoped
,
because
John
(
whether
my
master
mistrusts
or
no
,
I
ca
n't
say
)
had
been
sent
to
Lady
Davers
's
instead
of
Isaac
,
who
used
to
go
;
and
I
could
not
be
so
free
with
,
nor
so
well
trust
Isaac
;
though
he
is
very
civil
to
me
too
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
was
forced
to
stay
till
John
returned
.
  
<EOS>
As
I
may
not
have
opportunity
to
send
again
soon
,
and
yet
,
as
I
know
you
keep
my
letters
,
and
read
them
over
and
over
,
(
so
John
told
me
,
)
when
you
have
done
work
,
(
so
much
does
your
kindness
make
you
love
all
that
comes
from
your
poor
daughter
,
)
and
as
it
may
be
some
little
pleasure
to
me
,
perhaps
,
to
read
them
myself
,
when
I
am
come
to
you
,
to
remind
me
of
what
I
have
gone
through
,
and
how
great
God
's
goodness
has
been
to
me
,
(
which
,
I
hope
,
will
further
strengthen
my
good
resolutions
,
that
I
may
not
hereafter
,
from
my
bad
conduct
,
have
reason
to
condemn
myself
from
my
own
hand
as
it
were
)
:
<EOS>
For
all
these
reasons
,
I
say
,
I
will
write
as
I
have
time
,
and
as
matters
happen
,
and
send
the
scribble
to
you
as
I
have
opportunity
;
and
if
I
do
n't
every
time
,
in
form
,
subscribe
as
I
ought
<EOS>
,
I
am
sure
you
will
always
believe
,
that
it
is
not
for
want
of
duty
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
will
begin
where
I
left
off
,
about
the
talk
between
Mrs.
Jervis
and
me
,
for
me
to
ask
to
stay
.
  
<EOS>
Unknown
to
Mrs.
Jervis
,
I
put
a
project
,
as
I
may
call
it
,
in
practice
.
<EOS>
I
thought
with
myself
some
days
ago
,
Here
I
shall
go
home
to
my
poor
father
and
mother
,
and
have
nothing
on
my
back
,
that
will
be
fit
for
my
condition
;
for
how
should
your
poor
daughter
look
with
a
silk
night
-
gown
,
silken
petticoats
,
cambric
head
-
clothes
,
fine
holland
linen
,
laced
shoes
that
were
my
lady
's
;
and
fine
stockings
!
 
<EOS>
And
how
in
a
little
while
must
these
have
looked
,
like
old
cast
-
offs
,
indeed
,
and
I
looked
so
for
wearing
them
!
 
<EOS>
And
people
would
have
said
,
(
for
poor
folks
are
envious
as
well
as
rich
,
)
<EOS>
See
there
Goody
Andrews
's
daughter
,
turned
home
from
her
fine
place
!
 
<EOS>
What
a
tawdry
figure
she
makes
!
 
<EOS>
And
how
well
that
garb
becomes
her
poor
parents
'
circumstances
!
 
<EOS>
And
how
would
they
look
upon
me
,
thought
I
to
myself
,
when
they
should
come
to
be
threadbare
and
worn
out
?
 
<EOS>
And
how
should
I
look
,
even
if
I
could
purchase
homespun
clothes
,
to
dwindle
into
them
one
by
one
,
as
I
got
them
?
 
<EOS>
May
be
,
an
old
silk
gown
,
and
a
linsey
-
woolsey
petticoat
,
and
the
like
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
thought
<EOS>
I
,
I
had
better
get
myself
at
once
equipped
in
the
dress
that
will
become
my
condition
;
and
though
it
may
look
but
poor
to
what
I
have
been
used
to
wear
of
late
days
,
yet
it
will
serve
me
,
when
I
am
with
you
,
for
a
good
holiday
and
Sunday
suit
;
and
what
,
by
a
blessing
on
my
industry
,
I
may
,
perhaps
,
make
shift
to
keep
up
to
.
  
<EOS>
So
,
as
I
was
saying
,
unknown
to
any
body
,
I
bought
of
farmer
Nichols
's
wife
and
daughters
a
good
sad
-
coloured
stuff
,
of
their
own
spinning
,
enough
to
make
me
a
gown
and
two
petticoats
;
and
I
made
robings
and
facings
of
a
pretty
bit
of
printed
calico
I
had
by
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
had
a
pretty
good
camblet
quilted
coat
,
that
I
thought
might
do
tolerably
well
;
and
I
bought
two
flannel
undercoats
;
not
so
good
as
my
swanskin
and
fine
linen
ones
,
but
what
will
keep
me
warm
,
if
any
neighbour
should
get
me
to
go
out
to
help
'em
to
milk
,
now
and
then
,
as
sometimes
I
used
to
do
formerly
;
for
I
am
resolved
to
do
all
your
good
neighbours
what
kindness
I
can
;
and
hope
to
make
myself
as
much
beloved
about
you
,
as
I
am
here
.
  
<EOS>
I
got
some
pretty
good
Scotch
cloth
,
and
made
me
,
of
mornings
and
nights
,
when
nobody
saw
me
,
two
shifts
;
and
I
have
enough
left
for
two
shirts
,
and
two
shifts
,
for
you
my
dear
father
and
mother
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
come
home
,
I
'll
make
them
for
you
,
and
desire
your
acceptance
.
  
<EOS>
Then
I
bought
of
a
pedlar
,
two
pretty
enough
round
-
eared
caps
,
a
little
straw
-
hat
,
and
a
pair
of
knit
mittens
,
turned
up
with
white
calico
;
and
two
pair
of
ordinary
blue
worsted
hose
,
that
make
a
smartish
appearance
,
with
white
clocks
,
I
'll
assure
you
;
and
two
yards
of
black
riband
for
my
shift
sleeves
,
and
to
serve
as
a
necklace
;
and
when
I
had
'em
all
come
home
,
I
went
and
looked
upon
them
once
in
two
hours
,
for
two
days
together
:
<EOS>
For
,
you
must
know
,
though
I
be
with
Mrs.
Jervis
,
I
keep
my
own
little
apartment
still
for
my
clothes
,
and
nobody
goes
thither
but
myself
.
 
<EOS>
You
'll
say
I
was
no
bad
housewife
to
have
saved
so
much
money
;
but
my
dear
good
lady
was
always
giving
me
something
.
  
<EOS>
I
believed
myself
the
more
obliged
to
do
this
,
because
,
as
I
was
turned
away
for
what
my
good
master
thought
want
of
duty
;
and
as
he
expected
other
returns
for
his
presents
,
than
I
intended
to
make
him
,
so
I
thought
it
was
but
just
to
leave
his
presents
behind
me
when
I
went
away
;
for
,
you
know
,
if
I
would
not
earn
his
wages
,
why
should
I
have
them
?
  
<EOS>
Do
n't
trouble
yourself
about
the
four
guineas
,
nor
borrow
to
make
them
up
;
for
they
were
given
me
,
with
some
silver
,
as
I
told
you
,
as
a
perquisite
,
being
what
my
lady
had
about
her
when
she
died
;
and
,
as
I
hope
for
no
wages
,
I
am
so
vain
as
to
think
I
have
deserved
all
that
money
in
the
fourteen
months
,
since
my
lady
's
death
,
for
she
,
good
soul
,
overpaid
me
before
,
in
learning
and
other
kindnesses
.
 
<EOS>
Had
she
lived
,
none
of
these
things
might
have
happened
!
 
<EOS>
But
I
ought
to
be
thankful
'
tis
<EOS>
no
worse
.
 
<EOS>
Every
thing
will
turn
about
for
the
best
:
that
's
my
confidence
.
  
<EOS>
So
,
as
I
was
saying
,
I
have
provided
a
new
and
more
suitable
dress
,
and
I
long
to
appear
in
it
,
more
than
ever
I
did
in
any
new
clothes
in
my
life
:
for
then
I
shall
be
soon
after
with
you
,
and
at
ease
in
my
mind
 
<EOS>
But
,
mum
!
 
<EOS>
Here
he
comes
,
I
believe
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
,
etc
.
    
<EOS>
MY
DEAR
FATHER
AND
MOTHER
,
  
I
was
forced
to
break
off
:
for
I
feared
my
master
was
coming
:
but
it
proved
to
be
only
Mrs.
Jervis
.
 
<EOS>
She
said
,
I
ca
n't
endure
you
should
be
so
much
by
yourself
,
Pamela
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
,
said
I
,
dread
nothing
so
much
as
company
;
for
my
heart
was
up
at
my
mouth
now
,
for
fear
my
master
was
coming
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
always
rejoice
to
see
dear
Mrs.
Jervis
.
  
<EOS>
Said
she
,
I
have
had
a
world
of
talk
with
my
master
about
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
sorry
for
it
,
said
I
,
that
I
am
made
of
so
much
consequence
as
to
be
talked
of
by
him
.
 
<EOS>
O
,
said
she
,
I
must
not
tell
you
all
;
but
you
are
of
more
consequence
to
him
than
you
think
for
     
Or
wish
for
,
said
I
;
for
the
fruits
of
being
of
consequence
to
him
,
would
make
me
of
none
to
myself
,
or
any
body
else
.
  
<EOS>
Said
she
,
Thou
art
as
witty
as
any
lady
in
the
land
;
I
wonder
where
thou
gottest
it
.
 
<EOS>
But
they
must
be
poor
ladies
,
with
such
great
opportunities
<EOS>
,
I
am
sure
,
if
they
have
no
more
wit
than
I.
 
But
let
that
pass
.
  
<EOS>
I
suppose
,
said
I
,
that
I
am
of
so
much
consequence
,
however
,
as
to
vex
him
,
if
it
be
but
to
think
he
ca
n't
make
a
fool
of
such
a
one
as
I
;
and
that
is
nothing
at
all
,
but
a
rebuke
to
the
pride
of
his
high
condition
,
which
he
did
not
expect
,
and
knows
not
how
to
put
up
with
.
  
<EOS>
There
is
something
in
that
,
may
be
,
said
she
:
<EOS>
but
,
indeed
,
Pamela
,
he
is
very
angry
with
you
too
;
and
calls
you
twenty
perverse
things
;
wonders
at
his
own
folly
,
to
have
shewn
you
so
much
favour
,
as
he
calls
it
;
which
he
was
first
inclined
to
,
he
says
,
for
his
mother
's
sake
,
and
would
have
persisted
to
shew
you
for
your
own
,
if
you
was
not
your
own
enemy
.
  
<EOS>
Nay
,
now
I
sha
n't
love
you
,
Mrs.
Jervis
,
said
I
;
you
are
going
to
persuade
me
to
ask
to
stay
,
though
you
know
the
hazards
I
run
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
said
she
,
he
says
you
shall
go
;
for
he
thinks
it
wo
n't
be
for
his
reputation
to
keep
you
:
but
he
wished
(
do
n't
speak
of
it
for
the
world
,
Pamela
,
)
that
he
knew
a
lady
of
birth
,
just
such
another
as
yourself
,
in
person
and
mind
,
and
he
would
marry
her
to
-
morrow
.
  
<EOS>
I
coloured
up
to
the
ears
at
this
word
:
but
said
,
<EOS>
Yet
,
if
I
was
the
lady
of
birth
,
and
he
would
offer
to
be
rude
first
,
as
he
has
twice
done
to
poor
me
,
I
do
n't
know
whether
I
would
have
him
:
<EOS>
For
she
that
can
bear
an
insult
of
that
kind
,
I
should
think
not
worthy
to
be
a
gentleman
's
wife
:
any
more
than
he
would
be
a
gentleman
that
would
offer
it
.
  
<EOS>
Nay
,
now
,
Pamela
,
said
she
,
thou
carriest
thy
notions
a
great
way
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
dear
Mrs.
Jervis
,
said
I
,
very
seriously
,
for
I
could
not
help
it
,
I
am
more
full
of
fears
than
ever
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
only
to
beg
of
you
,
as
one
of
the
best
friends
I
have
in
the
world
,
to
say
nothing
of
my
asking
to
stay
.
<EOS>
To
say
my
master
likes
me
,
when
I
know
what
end
he
aims
at
,
is
abomination
to
my
ears
;
and
I
sha
n't
think
myself
safe
till
I
am
at
my
poor
father
's
and
<EOS>
mother
's
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
a
little
angry
with
me
,
till
I
assured
her
that
I
had
not
the
least
uneasiness
on
her
account
,
but
thought
myself
safe
under
her
protection
and
friendship
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
we
dropt
the
discourse
for
that
time
.
  
<EOS>
I
hope
to
have
finished
this
ugly
waistcoat
in
two
days
;
after
which
I
have
only
some
linen
to
get
up
,
and
shall
then
let
you
know
how
I
contrive
as
to
my
passage
;
for
the
heavy
rains
will
make
it
sad
travelling
on
foot
:
but
may
be
I
may
get
a
place
to
which
is
ten
miles
of
the
way
,
in
farmer
Nichols
's
close
cart
;
for
I
ca
n't
sit
a
horse
well
at
all
,
and
may
be
nobody
will
be
suffered
to
see
me
on
upon
the
way
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
hope
to
let
you
know
more
.
           
<EOS>
From
,
etc

<EOS>
MY
DEAR
FATHER
AND
MOTHER
,
  
<EOS>
All
my
fellow
-
servants
have
now
some
notion
that
I
am
to
go
away
;
but
ca
n't
imagine
for
what
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jervis
tells
them
,
that
my
father
and
mother
,
growing
in
years
,
can
not
live
without
me
;
and
so
I
go
home
to
them
,
to
help
to
comfort
their
old
age
;
but
they
seem
not
to
believe
it
.
  
<EOS>
What
they
found
it
out
by
was
;
the
butler
heard
him
say
to
me
,
as
I
passed
by
him
,
in
the
entry
leading
to
the
hall
,
<EOS>
Who
's
that
?
 
<EOS>
Pamela
,
sir
,
said
I.
 
Pamela
!
<EOS>
said
he
,
How
long
are
you
to
stay
here
?
 
<EOS>
Only
,
please
your
honour
,
said
I
,
till
I
have
done
the
waistcoat
;
and
it
is
almost
finished
.
 
<EOS>
You
might
,
says
he
,
(
very
roughly
indeed
,
)
have
finished
that
long
enough
ago
,
I
should
have
thought
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
and
please
your
honour
<EOS>
,
said
I
,
I
have
worked
early
and
late
upon
it
;
there
is
a
great
deal
of
work
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
Work
in
it
!
<EOS>
said
he
;
<EOS>
You
mind
your
pen
more
than
your
needle
;
I
do
n't
want
such
idle
sluts
to
stay
in
my
house
.
  
<EOS>
He
seemed
startled
,
when
he
saw
the
butler
,
as
he
entered
the
hall
,
where
Mr.
Jonathan
stood
.
 
<EOS>
What
do
you
here
?
<EOS>
said
he
.
 
<EOS>
The
butler
was
as
much
confounded
as
I
;
for
,
never
having
been
taxed
so
roughly
,
I
could
not
help
crying
sadly
;
and
got
out
of
both
their
ways
to
Mrs.
Jervis
,
and
told
my
complaint
.
 
<EOS>
This
love
,
said
she
,
is
the
d
#
#
#
#
!
 
<EOS>
In
how
many
strange
shapes
does
it
make
people
shew
themselves
!
 
<EOS>
And
in
some
the
farthest
from
their
hearts
.
  
<EOS>
So
one
,
and
then
another
,
has
been
since
whispering
,
Pray
,
Mrs.
Jervis
,
are
we
to
lose
Mrs.
Pamela
?
<EOS>
as
they
always
call
me
 
<EOS>
What
has
she
done
?
<EOS>
And
she
tells
them
,
as
above
,
about
going
home
to
you
.
  
<EOS>
She
said
afterwards
to
me
,
Well
,
Pamela
,
you
have
made
our
master
,
from
the
sweetest
tempered
gentleman
in
the
world
,
one
of
the
most
peevish
.
<EOS>
But
you
have
it
in
your
power
to
make
him
as
sweet
-
tempered
as
ever
;
though
I
hope
you
'll
never
do
it
on
his
terms
.
  
<EOS>
This
was
very
good
in
Mrs.
Jervis
;
but
it
intimated
,
that
she
thought
as
ill
of
his
designs
as
I
;
and
as
she
knew
his
mind
more
than
I
,
it
convinced
me
that
I
ought
to
get
away
as
fast
as
I
could
.
  
<EOS>
My
master
came
in
,
just
now
,
to
speak
to
Mrs.
Jervis
about
household
matters
,
having
some
company
to
dine
with
him
to
-
morrow
;
and
I
stood
up
,
and
having
been
crying
at
his
roughness
in
the
entry
,
I
turned
away
my
face
.
  
<EOS>
You
may
well
,
said
he
,
turn
away
your
cursed
face
<EOS>
;
I
wish
I
had
never
seen
it
!
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jervis
,
how
long
is
she
to
be
about
this
waistcoat
?
  
<EOS>
Sir
,
said
I
,
if
your
honour
had
pleased
,
I
would
have
taken
it
with
me
;
and
though
it
would
be
now
finished
in
a
few
hours
,
I
will
do
so
still
;
and
remove
this
hated
poor
Pamela
out
of
your
house
and
sight
for
ever
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jervis
,
said
he
,
not
speaking
to
me
<EOS>
,
I
believe
this
little
slut
has
the
power
of
witchcraft
,
if
ever
there
was
a
witch
;
for
she
enchants
all
that
come
near
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
makes
even
you
,
who
should
know
better
what
the
world
is
,
think
her
an
angel
of
light
.
  
<EOS>
I
offered
to
go
away
;
for
I
believe
he
wanted
me
to
ask
to
stay
in
my
place
,
for
all
this
his
great
wrath
:
and
he
said
,
Stay
here
!
 
<EOS>
Stay
here
,
when
I
bid
you
!
<EOS>
and
snatched
my
hand
.
 
<EOS>
I
trembled
,
and
said
,
I
will
!
<EOS>
I
will
!
<EOS>
for
he
hurt
my
fingers
,
he
grasped
me
so
hard
.
  
<EOS>
He
seemed
to
have
a
mind
to
say
something
to
me
;
but
broke
off
abruptly
,
and
said
,
Begone
!
 
<EOS>
And
away
I
tripped
as
fast
as
I
could
:
and
he
and
Mrs.
Jervis
had
a
deal
of
talk
,
as
she
told
me
;
and
among
the
rest
,
he
expressed
himself
vexed
to
have
spoken
in
Mr.
Jonathan
's
hearing
.
  
<EOS>
Now
you
must
know
,
that
Mr.
Jonathan
,
our
butler
,
is
a
very
grave
good
sort
of
old
man
,
with
his
hair
as
white
as
silver
!
<EOS>
and
an
honest
worthy
man
he
is
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
hurrying
out
with
a
flea
in
my
ear
,
as
the
saying
is
,
and
going
down
stairs
into
the
parlour
,
met
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
took
hold
of
my
hand
(
in
a
gentler
manner
,
though
,
than
my
master
)
with
both
his
;
and
he
said
,
Ah
!
<EOS>
sweet
,
sweet
Mrs.
Pamela
!
<EOS>
what
is
it
<EOS>
I
heard
<EOS>
but
just
now
!
 
<EOS>
I
am
sorry
at
my
heart
;
but
I
am
sure
I
will
sooner
believe
any
body
in
fault
than
you
.
 
<EOS>
Thank
you
,
Mr.
Jonathan
,
said
I
;
but
as
you
value
your
place
,
do
n't
be
seen
speaking
to
such
a
one
as
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
cried
too
;
and
slipt
away
as
fast
as
I
could
from
him
,
for
his
own
sake
,
lest
he
should
be
seen
to
pity
me
.
  
<EOS>
And
now
I
will
give
you
an
instance
how
much
I
am
in
Mr.
Longman
's
esteem
also
.
  
<EOS>
I
had
lost
my
pen
<EOS>
some
<EOS>
how
;
and
my
paper
being
written
out
,
I
stepped
to
Mr.
Longman
's
,
our
steward
's
,
office
,
to
beg
him
to
give
me
a
pen
or
two
,
and
a
sheet
or
two
of
paper
.
 
<EOS>
He
said
,
Ay
,
that
I
will
,
my
sweet
maiden
!
<EOS>
and
gave
me
three
pens
,
some
wafers
,
a
stick
of
wax
,
and
twelve
sheets
of
paper
;
and
coming
from
his
desk
,
where
he
was
writing
,
he
said
,
Let
me
have
a
word
or
two
with
you
,
my
sweet
little
mistress
:
(
for
so
these
two
good
old
gentlemen
often
call
me
;
for
I
believe
they
love
me
dearly
:
)
<EOS>
I
hear
bad
news
;
that
we
are
going
to
lose
you
<EOS>
:
I
hope
it
is
not
true
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
it
is
,
sir
,
said
I
;
but
I
was
in
hopes
it
would
not
be
known
till
I
went
away
.
  
<EOS>
What
a
d####l
,
said
he
,
ails
our
master
of
late
!
 
<EOS>
I
never
saw
such
an
alteration
in
any
man
in
my
life
!
 
<EOS>
He
is
pleased
with
nobody
as
I
see
;
and
by
what
Mr.
Jonathan
tells
me
just
now
,
he
was
quite
out
of
the
way
with
you
.
 
<EOS>
What
could
you
have
done
to
him
,
tro
'
?
 
<EOS>
Only
Mrs.
Jervis
is
a
very
good
woman
,
or
I
should
have
feared
she
had
been
your
enemy
.
  
<EOS>
No
,
said
I
,
nothing
like
it
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jervis
is
a
just
good
woman
;
and
,
next
to
my
father
and
mother
,
the
best
friend
I
have
in
the
world
 
<EOS>
Well
,
then
,
said
he
,
it
must
be
worse
.
 
<EOS>
Shall
I
guess
?
 
<EOS>
You
are
too
pretty
,
my
sweet
mistress
,
and
,
may
be
,
too
virtuous
.
 
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
have
I
not
hit
it
?
 
<EOS>
No
,
good
Mr.
Longman
,
said
I
,
do
n't
think
any
thing
amiss
of
my
master
;
he
is
cross
and
angry
with
me
indeed
,
that
's
true
;
but
I
may
have
given
occasion
for
it
,
possibly
;
and
because
I
am
desirous
to
go
to
my
father
and
mother
,
rather
than
stay
here
,
perhaps
he
may
think
me
ungrateful
.
<EOS>
But
,
you
know
,
sir
,
said
I
,
that
a
father
and
mother
's
comfort
is
the
dearest
thing
to
a
good
child
that
can
be
.
 
<EOS>
Sweet
excellence
!
<EOS>
said
he
,
this
becomes
you
;
but
I
know
the
world
and
mankind
too
well
;
though
I
must
hear
,
and
see
,
and
say
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
a
blessing
attend
my
little
sweeting
,
said
he
,
wherever
you
go
!
 
<EOS>
And
away
went
I
with
a
courtesy
and
thanks
.
  
<EOS>
Now
this
pleases
one
,
my
dear
father
and
mother
,
to
be
so
beloved
.
 
<EOS>
How
much
better
,
by
good
fame
and
integrity
,
is
it
to
get
every
one
's
good
word
but
one
,
than
,
by
pleasing
that
one
,
to
make
every
one
else
one
's
enemy
,
and
be
an
execrable
creature
besides
!
 
<EOS>
I
am

<EOS>
MY
DEAR
FATHER
AND
MOTHER
,
  
We
had
a
great
many
neighbouring
gentlemen
,
and
their
ladies
,
this
day
,
at
dinner
;
and
my
master
made
a
fine
entertainment
for
them
:
and
Isaac
,
and
Mr.
Jonathan
,
and
Benjamin
,
waited
at
table
:
<EOS>
And
Isaac
tells
Mrs.
Jervis
,
that
the
ladies
will
by
and
by
come
to
see
the
house
,
and
have
the
curiosity
to
see
me
<EOS>
;
for
,
it
seems
,
they
said
to
my
master
,
when
the
jokes
flew
about
,
<EOS>
Well
,
Mr.
B
#
#
#
#
,
we
understand
you
have
a
servant
-
maid
,
who
is
the
greatest
beauty
in
the
county
;
and
we
promise
ourselves
to
see
her
before
we
go
.
  
<EOS>
The
wench
is
well
enough
,
said
he
;
but
no
such
beauty
as
you
talk
of
<EOS>
,
I
'll
assure
ye
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
my
mother
's
waiting
-
maid
,
who
,
on
her
death
-
bed
,
engaged
me
to
be
kind
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
is
young
,
and
every
thing
is
pretty
that
is
young
.
  
<EOS>
Ay
,
ay
,
said
one
of
the
ladies
,
that
's
true
;
but
if
your
mother
had
not
recommended
her
so
strongly
,
there
is
so
much
merit
in
beauty
,
that
I
make
no
doubt
such
a
fine
gentleman
would
have
wanted
no
inducement
to
be
kind
to
it
.
  
<EOS>
They
all
laughed
at
my
master
:
<EOS>
And
he
,
it
seems
,
laughed
for
company
;
but
said
,
I
do
n't
know
how
it
is
,
but
I
see
with
different
eyes
from
other
people
;
for
I
have
heard
much
more
talk
of
her
prettiness
,
than
I
think
it
deserves
<EOS>
:
She
is
well
enough
,
as
I
said
:
but
her
greatest
excellence
is
,
that
she
is
humble
,
and
courteous
,
and
faithful
,
and
makes
all
her
fellow
-
servants
love
her
:
My
housekeeper
,
in
particular
,
doats
upon
her
;
and
you
know
,
ladies
,
she
is
a
woman
of
discernment
:
<EOS>
And
,
as
for
Mr.
Longman
,
and
Jonathan
,
here
,
if
they
thought
themselves
young
enough
,
I
am
told
,
they
would
fight
for
her
.
 
<EOS>
Is
it
not
true
,
Jonathan
?
 
<EOS>
Troth
,
sir
,
said
he
,
an't
please
your
honour
<EOS>
,
I
never
knew
her
peer
,
and
all
your
honour
's
family
are
of
the
same
mind
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
hear
now
?
<EOS>
said
my
master
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
said
the
ladies
,
we
will
make
a
visit
to
Mrs.
Jervis
by
and
by
,
and
hope
to
see
this
paragon
.
  
<EOS>
I
believe
they
are
coming
;
and
will
tell
you
the
rest
by
and
by
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
they
had
come
,
and
were
gone
.
 
<EOS>
Why
ca
n't
they
make
their
game
without
me
?
  
<EOS>
Well
,
these
fine
ladies
have
been
here
,
and
are
gone
back
again
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
have
been
absent
,
if
I
could
,
and
did
step
into
the
closet
:
so
they
saw
me
when
they
came
in
.
  
<EOS>
There
were
four
of
them
,
Lady
Arthur
at
the
great
white
house
on
the
hill
,
Lady
Brooks
,
Lady
Towers
,
and
the
other
<EOS>
,
it
seems
,
a
countess
,
of
some
hard
name
<EOS>
,
I
forget
what
.
  
<EOS>
So
Mrs.
Jervis
,
says
one
of
the
ladies
,
how
do
you
do
?
 
<EOS>
We
are
all
come
to
inquire
after
your
health
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
much
obliged
to
your
ladyships
,
said
Mrs.
Jervis
:
<EOS>
Will
your
ladyships
please
to
sit
down
?
 
<EOS>
But
,
said
the
countess
,
we
are
not
only
come
to
ask
after
Mrs.
Jervis
's
health
neither
;
but
we
are
come
to
see
a
rarity
besides
.
 
<EOS>
Ah
,
says
Lady
Arthur
,
I
have
not
seen
your
Pamela
these
two
years
,
and
they
tell
me
she
is
grown
wondrous
pretty
in
that
time
.
  
<EOS>
Then
I
wished
I
had
not
been
in
the
closet
;
for
when
I
came
out
,
they
must
needs
<EOS>
know
<EOS>
I
heard
them
;
but
I
have
often
found
,
that
bashful
bodies
owe
themselves
a
spite
,
and
frequently
confound
themselves
more
,
by
endeavouring
to
avoid
confusion
.
  
<EOS>
Why
,
yes
,
says
Mrs.
Jervis
,
Pamela
is
very
pretty
indeed
;
she
's
but
in
the
closet
there
:
 
Pamela
,
pray
step
hither
.
 
<EOS>
I
came
out
all
covered
with
blushes
,
and
they
smiled
at
one
another
.
  
<EOS>
The
countess
took
me
by
the
hand
:
Why
,
indeed
,
she
was
pleased
to
say
,
report
has
not
been
too
lavish
,
I
'll
assure
you
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
be
ashamed
,
child
;
(
and
stared
full
in
my
face
;
)
<EOS>
I
wish
I
had
just
such
a
face
to
be
ashamed
of
.
 
<EOS>
O
how
like
a
fool
I
looked
!
  
<EOS>
Lady
Arthur
said
,
Ay
,
my
good
Pamela
,
I
say
as
her
ladyship
says
:
Do
n't
be
so
confused
;
though
,
indeed
,
it
becomes
you
too
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
your
good
lady
departed
made
a
sweet
choice
of
such
a
pretty
attendant
.
 
<EOS>
She
would
have
been
mighty
proud
of
you
,
as
she
always
was
praising
you
,
had
she
lived
till
now
.
  
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
madam
<EOS>
,
said
Lady
Brooks
,
do
you
think
that
so
dutiful
a
son
as
our
neighbour
,
who
always
admired
what
his
mother
loved
,
does
not
pride
himself
,
for
all
what
he
said
at
table
,
in
such
a
pretty
maiden
?
  
<EOS>
She
looked
with
such
a
malicious
sneering
countenance
,
I
ca
n't
abide
her
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Towers
said
with
a
free
air
,
(
for
it
seems
she
is
called
a
wit
,
)
<EOS>
Well
,
Mrs.
Pamela
,
I
ca
n't
say
I
like
you
so
well
as
these
ladies
do
;
for
I
should
never
care
,
if
you
were
my
servant
,
to
have
you
and
your
master
in
the
same
house
together
.
 
<EOS>
Then
they
all
set
up
a
great
laugh
.
  
<EOS>
I
know
what
I
could
have
said
,
if
I
durst
.
 
<EOS>
But
they
are
ladies
 
and
<EOS>
ladies
may
say
any
thing
.
  
<EOS>
Says
Lady
Towers
,
<EOS>
Can
the
pretty
image
speak
,
Mrs.
Jervis
?
 
<EOS>
I
vow
<EOS>
she
has
speaking
eyes
!
 
<EOS>
O
you
little
rogue
,
said
she
,
and
tapped
me
on
the
cheek
,
you
seem
born
to
undo
,
or
to
be
undone
!
  
<EOS>
God
forbid
,
and
please
your
ladyship
,
said
I
,
it
should
be
either
!
 
<EOS>
I
beg
,
said
I
,
to
withdraw
;
for
the
sense
I
have
of
my
unworthiness
renders
me
unfit
for
such
a
presence
.
  
<EOS>
I
then
went
away
,
with
one
of
my
best
courtesies
;
and
Lady
Towers
said
,
as
I
went
out
,
<EOS>
Prettily
said
,
I
vow
!
 
<EOS>
And
Lady
Brooks
said
,
See
that
shape
!
 
<EOS>
I
never
saw
such
a
face
and
shape
in
my
life
;
why
,
she
must
be
better
descended
than
you
have
told
me
!
  
<EOS>
And
so
they
run
on
for
half
an
hour
more
in
my
praises
,
as
I
was
told
;
and
glad
was
I
,
when
I
got
out
of
the
hearing
of
them
.
  
<EOS>
But
,
it
seems
,
they
went
down
with
such
a
story
to
my
master
,
and
so
full
of
me
,
that
he
had
much
ado
to
stand
it
;
but
as
it
was
very
little
to
my
reputation
,
I
am
sure
I
could
take
no
pride
in
it
;
and
I
feared
it
would
make
no
better
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
This
gives
me
another
cause
for
wishing
myself
out
of
this
house
.
  
<EOS>
This
is
Thursday
morning
,
and
next
Thursday
I
hope
to
set
out
;
for
I
have
finished
my
task
,
and
my
master
is
horrid
cross
!
 
<EOS>
And
I
am
vexed
<EOS>
his
crossness
affects
me
so
.
 
<EOS>
If
ever
he
had
any
kindness
towards
me
,
I
believe
he
now
hates
me
heartily
.
  
<EOS>
Is
it
not
strange
,
that
love
borders
so
much
upon
hate
?
 
<EOS>
But
this
wicked
love
is
not
like
the
true
virtuous
love
,
to
be
sure
:
that
and
hatred
must
be
as
far
off
,
as
light
and
darkness
.
 
<EOS>
And
how
must
this
hate
have
been
increased
,
if
he
had
met
with
such
a
base
compliance
,
after
his
wicked
will
had
been
gratified
.
  
<EOS>
Well
,
one
may
see
by
a
little
,
what
a
great
deal
means
.
 
<EOS>
For
if
innocence
can
not
attract
common
civility
,
what
must
guilt
expect
,
when
novelty
has
ceased
to
have
its
charms
,
and
changeableness
had
taken
place
of
it
?
<EOS>
Thus
we
read
in
Holy
Writ
,
that
wicked
Amnon
,
when
he
had
ruined
poor
Tamar
,
hated
her
more
than
he
ever
loved
her
,
and
would
have
turned
her
out
of
door
.
  
<EOS>
How
happy
am
I
,
to
be
turned
out
of
door
,
with
that
sweet
companion
my
innocence
!
 
<EOS>
O
may
that
be
always
my
companion
!
 
<EOS>
And
while
I
presume
not
upon
my
own
strength
,
and
am
willing
to
avoid
the
tempter
,
I
hope
the
divine
grace
will
assist
me
.
  
<EOS>
Forgive
me
,
that
I
repeat
in
my
letter
part
of
my
hourly
prayer
.
 
<EOS>
I
owe
every
thing
,
next
to
God
's
goodness
,
to
your
piety
and
good
examples
,
my
dear
parents
,
my
dear
poor
parents
!
 
<EOS>
I
say
that
word
with
pleasure
;
for
your
poverty
is
my
pride
,
as
your
integrity
shall
he
my
imitation
.
  
<EOS>
As
soon
as
I
have
dined
,
I
will
put
on
my
new
clothes
.
 
<EOS>
I
long
to
have
them
on
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
I
shall
surprise
Mrs.
Jervis
with
them
;
for
she
sha
n't
see
me
till
I
am
full
dressed
.
 
<EOS>
John
is
come
back
,
and
I
'll
soon
send
you
some
of
what
I
have
written
.
 
<EOS>
I
find
he
is
going
early
in
the
morning
;
and
so
I
'll
close
here
,
that
I
am
                                   
Your
most
dutiful
DAUGHTER
.
  
<EOS>
Do
n't
lose
your
time
in
meeting
me
;
because
I
am
so
uncertain
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
hard
if
,
some
how
or
other
,
I
ca
n't
get
a
passage
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
But
may
be
my
master
wo
n't
refuse
to
let
John
bring
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
ride
behind
him
,
I
believe
,
well
enough
;
for
he
is
very
careful
,
and
very
honest
;
and
you
know
John
as
well
as
I
;
for
he
loves
you
both
.
 
<EOS>
Besides
,
may
be
,
Mrs.
Jervis
can
put
me
in
some
way
.
    
<EOS>
DEAR
FATHER
AND
MOTHER
,
  
<EOS>
I
shall
write
on
,
as
long
as
I
stay
,
though
I
should
have
nothing
but
silliness
to
write
;
for
I
know
you
divert
yourselves
on
nights
with
what
I
write
,
because
it
is
mine
.
 
<EOS>
John
tells
me
how
much
you
long
for
my
coming
;
but
he
says
,
he
told
you
he
hoped
something
would
happen
to
hinder
it
.
  
<EOS>
I
am
glad
you
did
not
tell
him
the
occasion
of
my
coming
away
;
for
if
my
fellow
-
servants
should
guess
,
it
were
better
so
,
than
to
have
it
from
you
or
me
.
 
<EOS>
Besides
,
I
really
am
concerned
,
that
my
master
should
cast
away
a
thought
upon
such
a
poor
creature
as
me
;
for
,
besides
the
disgrace
,
it
has
quite
turned
his
temper
;
and
I
begin
to
believe
what
Mrs.
Jervis
told
me
,
that
he
likes
me
,
and
ca
n't
help
it
;
and
yet
strives
to
conquer
it
;
and
so
finds
no
way
but
to
be
cross
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
Do
n't
think
me
presumptuous
and
conceited
;
for
it
is
more
my
concern
than
my
pride
,
to
see
such
a
gentleman
so
demean
himself
,
and
lessen
the
regard
he
used
to
have
in
the
eyes
of
all
his
servants
,
on
my
account
.
  
<EOS>
But
I
am
to
tell
you
of
my
new
dress
to
day
.
  
<EOS>
And
so
,
when
I
had
dined
,
up
<EOS>
stairs
<EOS>
I
went
,
and
locked
myself
into
my
little
room
.
 
<EOS>
There
I
tricked
myself
up
as
well
as
I
could
in
my
new
garb
,
and
put
on
my
round
-
eared
ordinary
cap
;
but
with
a
green
knot
,
however
,
and
my
homespun
gown
and
petticoat
,
and
plain
leather
shoes
;
but
yet
they
are
what
they
call
Spanish
leather
;
and
my
ordinary
hose
,
ordinary
<EOS>
I
mean
to
what
I
have
been
lately
used
to
;
though
I
shall
think
good
yarn
may
do
very
well
for
every
day
,
when
I
come
home
.
 
<EOS>
A
plain
muslin
tucker
I
put
on
,
and
my
black
silk
necklace
,
instead
of
the
French
necklace
my
lady
gave
me
;
and
put
the
ear
-
rings
out
of
my
ears
;
and
when
I
was
quite
equipped
,
I
took
my
straw
hat
in
my
hand
,
with
its
two
blue
strings
,
and
looked
about
me
in
the
glass
,
as
proud
as
any
thing
 
<EOS>
To
say
truth
,
I
never
liked
myself
so
well
in
my
life
.
  
<EOS>
O
the
pleasure
of
descending
with
ease
,
innocence
,
and
resignation
!
  
<EOS>
Indeed
,
there
is
nothing
like
it
!
 
<EOS>
An
humble
mind
,
I
plainly
see
,
can
not
meet
with
any
very
shocking
disappointment
,
let
fortune
's
wheel
turn
round
as
it
will
.
  
<EOS>
So
I
went
down
to
look
for
Mrs.
Jervis
,
to
see
how
she
liked
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
met
,
as
I
was
upon
the
stairs
,
our
Rachel
,
who
is
the
house
-
maid
;
and
she
made
me
a
low
courtesy
,
and
I
found
did
not
know
me
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
smiled
,
and
went
to
the
housekeeper
's
parlour
;
and
there
sat
good
Mrs.
Jervis
at
work
,
making
a
shift
:
and
,
would
you
believe
it
?
<EOS>
she
did
not
know
me
at
first
;
but
rose
up
,
and
pulled
off
her
spectacles
;
and
said
,
<EOS>
Do
you
want
me
,
forsooth
?
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
help
laughing
,
and
said
,
Hey
-
day
!
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jervis
,
what
!
<EOS>
do
n't
you
know
me
?
 
<EOS>
She
stood
all
in
amaze
,
and
looked
at
me
from
top
to
toe
:
<EOS>
Why
,
you
surprise
me
,
said
she
:
<EOS>
What
!
<EOS>
Pamela
thus
metamorphosed
!
 
<EOS>
How
came
this
about
?
  
<EOS>
As
it
happened
,
in
stept
my
master
;
and
my
back
being
to
him
,
he
thought
it
was
a
stranger
speaking
to
Mrs.
Jervis
,
and
withdrew
again
:
and
did
not
hear
her
ask
,
If
his
honour
had
any
commands
for
her
?
 
<EOS>
She
turned
me
about
and
about
,
and
I
shewed
her
all
my
dress
,
to
my
under
-
petticoat
:
and
<EOS>
she
said
,
sitting
down
,
Why
,
I
am
all
in
amaze
,
I
must
sit
down
.
<EOS>
What
can
all
this
mean
?
 
<EOS>
I
told
her
,
I
had
no
clothes
suitable
to
my
condition
when
I
returned
to
my
father
's
;
and
so
it
was
better
to
begin
here
,
as
I
was
soon
to
go
away
,
that
all
my
fellow
-
servants
might
see
I
knew
how
to
suit
myself
to
the
state
I
was
returning
to
.
  
<EOS>
Well
,
said
she
,
I
never
knew
the
like
of
thee
.
 
<EOS>
But
this
sad
preparation
for
going
away
(
for
now
I
see
you
are
quite
in
earnest
)
is
what
I
know
not
how
to
get
over
.
 
<EOS>
O
<EOS>
my
dear
Pamela
,
how
can
I
part
with
you
!
  
<EOS>
My
master
rung
in
the
back
-
parlour
,
and
so
I
withdrew
,
and
Mrs.
Jervis
went
to
attend
him
.
 
<EOS>
It
seems
,
he
said
to
her
,
I
was
coming
in
to
let
you
know
,
that
I
shall
go
to
Lincolnshire
,
and
possibly
to
my
sister
Davers
's
,
and
be
absent
some
weeks
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
pray
,
what
pretty
neat
damsel
was
with
you
?
 
<EOS>
She
says
,
she
smiled
,
and
asked
,
If
his
honour
did
not
know
who
it
was
?
 
<EOS>
No
,
said
he
,
I
never
saw
her
before
.

,
or
Farmer
Brady
,
have
neither
of
them
such
a
tight
prim
lass
for
a
daughter
!
<EOS>
have
they
?
 
<EOS>
Though
I
did
not
see
her
face
neither
,
said
he
.
 
<EOS>
If
your
honour
wo
n't
be
angry
,
said
she
,
I
will
introduce
her
into
your
presence
;
for
I
think
,
says
she
,
she
outdoes
our
Pamela
.
  
<EOS>
Now
I
did
not
thank
her
for
this
,
as
I
told
her
afterwards
,
(
for
it
brought
a
great
deal
of
trouble
upon
me
,
as
well
as
crossness
,
as
you
shall
hear
)
.
 
<EOS>
That
ca
n't
be
,
he
was
pleased
to
say
.
 
<EOS>
But
if
you
can
find
an
excuse
for
it
,
let
her
come
in
.
  
<EOS>
At
that
she
stept
to
me
,
and
told
me
,
I
must
go
in
with
her
to
her
master
;
but
,
said
she
,
for
goodness
'
sake
,
let
him
find
you
out
;
for
he
do
n't
know
you
.
 
<EOS>
O
fie
,
Mrs.
Jervis
,
said
I
,
how
could
you
serve
me
so
?
<EOS>
Besides
,
it
looks
too
free
both
in
me
,
and
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
you
,
said
she
,
you
shall
come
in
;
and
pray
do
n't
reveal
yourself
till
he
finds
you
out
.
  
<EOS>
So
I
went
in
,
foolish
as
I
was
;
though
I
must
have
been
seen
by
him
another
time
,
if
I
had
not
then
.
 
<EOS>
And
she
would
make
me
take
my
straw
hat
in
my
hand
.
  
<EOS>
I
dropt
a
low
courtesy
,
but
said
never
a
word
.
 
<EOS>
I
dare
say
he
knew
me
as
soon
as
he
saw
my
face
:
but
was
as
cunning
as
Lucifer
.
 
<EOS>
He
came
up
to
me
,
and
took
me
by
the
hand
,
and
said
,
Whose
pretty
maiden
are
you
?
 
<EOS>
I
dare
say
you
are
Pamela
's
sister
,
you
are
so
like
her
.
 
<EOS>
So
neat
,
so
clean
,
so
pretty
!
 
<EOS>
Why
,
child
,
you
far
surpass
your
sister
Pamela
!
  
<EOS>
I
was
all
confusion
,
and
would
have
spoken
:
but
he
took
me
about
the
neck
:
<EOS>
Why
,
said
he
,
you
are
very
pretty
<EOS>
,
child
:
I
would
not
be
so
free
with
your
sister
,
you
may
believe
;
but
I
must
kiss
you
.
  
<EOS>
O
sir
,
said
I
,
I
am
Pamela
,
indeed
I
am
:
<EOS>
indeed
I
am
Pamela
,
her
own
self
!
  
<EOS>
He
kissed
me
for
all
I
could
do
;
and
said
,
Impossible
!
<EOS>
you
are
a
lovelier
girl
by
half
than
Pamela
;
and
sure
I
may
be
innocently
free
with
you
,
though
I
would
not
do
her
so
much
favour
.
  
<EOS>
This
was
a
sad
trick
upon
me
,
indeed
,
and
what
I
could
not
expect
;
and
Mrs.
Jervis
looked
like
a
fool
as
much
as
I
,
for
her
officiousness
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
I
got
away
,
and
ran
out
of
the
parlour
,
most
sadly
vexed
,
as
you
may
well
think
.
  
<EOS>
He
talked
a
good
deal
to
Mrs.
Jervis
,
and
at
last
ordered
me
to
come
in
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
Come
in
,
said
he
,
you
little
villain
!
 
<EOS>
for
so
he
called
me
.
<EOS>
(
Good
sirs
!
<EOS>
what
a
name
was
there
!
)
 
<EOS>
who
is
it
<EOS>
you
put
your
tricks
upon
?
<EOS>
I
was
resolved
never
to
honour
your
unworthiness
,
said
he
,
with
so
much
notice
again
;
and
so
you
must
disguise
yourself
to
attract
me
,
and
yet
pretend
,
like
an
hypocrite
as
you
are
     
<EOS>
I
was
out
of
patience
then
<EOS>
:
Hold
,
good
sir
,
said
I
;
do
n't
impute
disguise
and
hypocrisy
to
me
,
above
all
things
;
for
I
hate
them
both
,
mean
as
I
am
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
put
on
no
disguise
.
 
<EOS>
What
a
plague
,
said
he
,
for
that
was
his
word
,
do
you
mean
then
by
this
dress
?
 
<EOS>
Why
,
and
please
your
honour
,
said
I
,
I
mean
one
of
the
honestest
things
in
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
been
in
disguise
,
indeed
,
ever
since
my
good
lady
your
mother
took
me
from
my
poor
parents
.
 
<EOS>
I
came
to
her
ladyship
so
poor
and
mean
,
that
these
clothes
I
have
on
,
are
a
princely
suit
to
those
I
had
then
:
and
her
goodness
heaped
upon
me
rich
clothes
,
and
other
bounties
:
<EOS>
and
as
I
am
now
returning
to
my
poor
parents
again
so
soon
,
I
can
not
wear
those
good
things
without
being
hooted
at
;
and
so
have
bought
what
will
be
more
suitable
to
my
degree
,
and
be
a
good
holiday
-
suit
too
,
when
I
get
home
.
  
<EOS>
He
then
took
me
in
his
arms
,
and
presently
pushed
me
from
him
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jervis
,
said
he
,
take
the
little
witch
from
me
;
I
can
neither
bear
,
nor
forbear
her
(
Strange
words
these
!
)
 
<EOS>
But
stay
;
you
sha
n't
go
!
 
<EOS>
Yet
begone
!
 
<EOS>
No
,
come
back
again
.
  
<EOS>
I
thought
he
was
mad
,
for
my
share
;
for
he
knew
not
what
he
would
have
.
<EOS>
I
was
going
,
however
;
but
he
stept
after
me
,
and
took
hold
of
my
arm
,
and
brought
me
in
again
:
<EOS>
I
am
sure
he
made
my
arm
black
and
blue
;
for
the
marks
are
upon
it
still
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
sir
,
said
I
,
pray
have
mercy
;
I
will
,
I
will
come
in
!
  
<EOS>
He
sat
down
,
and
looked
at
me
,
and
,
as
I
thought
afterwards
,
as
sillily
as
such
a
poor
girl
as
I.
 
<EOS>
At
last
he
said
,
Well
,
Mrs.
Jervis
,
as
I
was
telling
you
,
you
may
permit
her
to
stay
a
little
longer
,
till
I
see
if
my
sister
Davers
will
have
her
;
if
,
mean
time
,
she
humble
herself
,
and
ask
this
as
a
favour
,
and
is
sorry
for
her
pertness
,
and
the
liberty
she
has
taken
with
my
character
out
of
the
house
,
and
in
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
Your
honour
indeed
told
me
so
,
said
Mrs.
Jervis
:
<EOS>
but
I
never
found
her
inclinable
to
think
herself
in
a
fault
.
 
<EOS>
Pride
and
perverseness
,
said
he
,
with
a
vengeance
!
 
<EOS>
Yet
this
is
your
doating
-
piece
!
 
<EOS>
Well
,
for
once
,
I
'll
submit
myself
to
tell
you
,
hussy
,
said
he
to
me
,
you
may
stay
a
fortnight
longer
,
till
I
see
my
sister
Davers
:
Do
you
hear
what
I
say
to
you
,
statue
?
 
<EOS>
Can
you
neither
speak
nor
be
thankful
?
 
<EOS>
Your
honour
frights
me
so
,
said
I
,
that
I
can
hardly
speak
:
<EOS>
But
I
will
venture
to
say
,
that
I
have
only
to
beg
,
as
a
favour
,
that
I
may
go
to
my
father
and
mother
.
  
<EOS>
Why
fool
,
said
he
,
wo
n't
you
like
to
go
to
wait
on
my
sister
Davers
?
<EOS>
Sir
,
said
I
,
I
was
once
fond
of
that
honour
;
but
you
were
pleased
to
say
,
I
might
be
in
danger
from
her
ladyship
's
nephew
,
or
he
from
me
.
 
<EOS>
D####d
impertinence
!
<EOS>
said
he
;
<EOS>
Do
you
hear
,
Mrs.
Jervis
,
do
you
hear
,
how
she
retorts
upon
me
?
 
<EOS>
Was
ever
such
matchless
assurance
!
<EOS>
#
#
#
#
  
I
then
fell
a
weeping
;
for
Mrs.
Jervis
said
,
Fie
,
Pamela
,
fie
!
 
<EOS>
And
I
said
,
My
lot
is
very
hard
indeed
;
I
am
sure
I
would
hurt
nobody
;
and
I
have
been
,
it
seems
,
guilty
of
indiscretions
,
which
have
cost
me
my
place
,
and
my
master
's
favour
,
and
so
have
been
turned
her
away
:
and
when
the
time
is
come
,
that
I
should
return
to
my
poor
parents
,
I
am
not
suffered
to
go
quietly
.
 
<EOS>
Good
your
honour
<EOS>
,
what
have
I
done
,
that
I
must
be
used
worse
than
if
I
had
robbed
you
?
  
<EOS>
Robbed
me
!
<EOS>
said
he
,
why
so
you
have
,
hussy
;
you
have
robbed
me
.
 
<EOS>
Who
?
 
I
,
sir
?
<EOS>
said
I
;
have
I
robbed
you
?
 
<EOS>
Why
then
you
are
a
justice
of
peace
,
and
may
send
me
to
gaol
,
if
you
please
,
and
bring
me
to
a
trial
for
my
life
!
<EOS>
If
you
can
prove
that
I
have
robbed
you
,
I
am
sure
I
ought
to
die
.
  
<EOS>
Now
I
was
quite
ignorant
of
his
meaning
;
though
I
did
not
like
it
,
when
it
was
afterwards
explained
,
neither
:
<EOS>
And
well
,
thought
I
,
what
will
this
come
to
at
last
,
if
poor
Pamela
is
esteemed
a
thief
!
 
<EOS>
Then
I
thought
in
an
instant
,
how
I
should
shew
my
face
to
my
honest
poor
parents
,
if
I
was
but
suspected
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
sir
,
said
I
,
let
me
ask
you
but
one
question
,
and
pray
do
n't
let
me
be
called
names
for
it
;
for
I
do
n't
mean
disrespectfully
:
Why
,
if
I
have
done
amiss
,
am
I
not
left
to
be
discharged
by
your
housekeeper
,
as
the
other
maids
have
been
?
 
<EOS>
And
if
Jane
,
or
Rachel
,
or
Hannah
,
were
to
offend
,
would
your
honour
stoop
to
take
notice
of
them
?
 
<EOS>
And
why
should
you
so
demean
yourself
to
take
notice
of
me
?
 
<EOS>
Pray
,
sir
,
if
I
have
not
been
worse
than
others
,
why
should
I
suffer
more
than
others
?
<EOS>
and
why
should
I
not
be
turned
away
,
and
there
's
an
end
of
it
?
 
<EOS>
For
indeed
I
am
not
of
consequence
enough
for
my
master
to
concern
himself
,
and
be
angry
about
such
a
creature
as
me
.
  
<EOS>
Do
you
hear
,
Mrs.
Jervis
,
cried
he
again
,
how
pertly
I
am
interrogated
by
this
saucy
slut
?
 
<EOS>
Why
,
sauce
-
box
,
says
he
,
did
not
my
good
mother
desire
me
to
take
care
of
you
?
 
<EOS>
And
have
you
not
been
always
distinguished
by
me
,
above
a
common
servant
?
 
<EOS>
And
does
your
ingratitude
upbraid
me
for
this
?
  
<EOS>
I
said
something
mutteringly
,
and
he
vowed
he
would
hear
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
begged
excuse
;
but
he
insisted
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
then
,
said
I
,
if
your
honour
must
know
,
I
said
,
That
my
good
lady
did
not
desire
your
care
to
extend
to
the
summer
-
house
,
and
her
dressing
-
room
.
  
<EOS>
Well
,
this
was
a
little
saucy
,
you
'll
say
 
<EOS>
And
he
flew
into
such
a
passion
,
that
I
was
forced
to
run
for
it
;
and
Mrs.
Jervis
said
,
It
was
happy
I
got
out
of
the
way
.
  
<EOS>
Why
what
makes
him
provoke
one
<EOS>
so
,
then
?
 
<EOS>
I
'm
almost
sorry
for
it
;
but
I
would
be
glad
to
get
away
at
any
rate
.
 
<EOS>
For
I
begin
to
be
more
fearful
now
.
  
<EOS>
Just
now
Mr.
Jonathan
sent
me
these
lines
(
Bless
me
!
<EOS>
what
shall
I
do
?
)
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
Mrs.
Pamela
,
Take
care
of
yourself
;
for
Rachel
heard
my
master
say
to
Mrs.
Jervis
,
who
,
she
believes
,
was
pleading
for
you
,
Say
no
more
,
Mrs.
Jervis
;
for
by
G####d
I
will
have
her
!
 
<EOS>
Burn
this
instantly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
O
pray
for
your
poor
daughter
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
called
to
go
to
bed
by
Mrs.
Jervis
<EOS>
,
for
it
is
past
eleven
;
and
I
am
sure
she
shall
hear
of
it
;
for
all
this
is
owing
to
her
,
though
she
did
not
mean
any
harm
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
have
been
,
and
am
,
in
a
strange
fluster
;
and
I
suppose
too
,
she
'll
say
,
I
have
been
full
pert
.
  
<EOS>
O
<EOS>
my
dear
father
and
mother
,
power
and
riches
never
want
advocates
!
 
<EOS>
But
,
poor
gentlewoman
,
she
can
not
live
without
him
:
and
he
has
been
very
good
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
So
good
night
.
 
<EOS>
May
be
<EOS>
I
shall
send
this
in
the
morning
;
but
may
be
not
;
so
wo
n't
conclude
:
though
I
ca
n't
say
too
often
,
that
I
am
(
though
with
great
apprehension
)
                     
<EOS>
Your
most
dutiful
DAUGHTER
.
    
<EOS>
MY
DEAR
PARENTS
,
  
<EOS>
O
let
me
take
up
my
complaint
,
and
say
,
Never
was
poor
creature
so
unhappy
,
and
so
barbarously
used
,
as
poor
Pamela
!
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
my
dear
father
and
mother
,
my
heart
's
just
broke
!
 
<EOS>
I
can
neither
write
as
I
should
do
,
nor
let
it
alone
,
for
to
whom
<EOS>
but
you
can
I
vent
my
griefs
,
and
keep
my
poor
heart
from
bursting
!
 
<EOS>
Wicked
,
wicked
man
!
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
patience
when
I
think
of
him
!
 
<EOS>
But
yet
,
do
n't
be
frightened
 
for
 
<EOS>
I
hope
 
<EOS>
I
hope
,
I
am
honest
!
 
<EOS>
But
if
my
head
and
my
hand
will
let
me
,
you
shall
hear
all
.
 
<EOS>
Is
there
no
constable
,
nor
headborough
,
though
,
to
take
me
out
of
his
house
?
<EOS>
for
I
am
sure
I
can
safely
swear
the
peace
against
him
:
<EOS>
But
,
alas
!
<EOS>
he
is
greater
than
any
constable
:
he
is
a
justice
himself
:
<EOS>
Such
a
justice
deliver
me
from
!
 
<EOS>
But
God
Almighty
,
I
hope
,
in
time
,
will
right
me
 
<EOS>
For
he
knows
the
innocence
of
my
heart
!
  
<EOS>
John
went
your
way
in
the
morning
;
but
I
have
been
too
much
distracted
to
send
by
him
;
and
have
seen
nobody
but
Mrs.
Jervis
or
Rachel
,
and
one
I
hate
to
see
or
be
seen
by
and
indeed
I
hate
now
to
see
any
body
.
 
<EOS>
Strange
things
I
have
to
tell
you
,
that
happened
since
last
night
,
that
good
Mr.
Jonathan
's
letter
,
and
my
master
's
harshness
,
put
me
into
such
a
fluster
;
but
I
will
not
keep
you
in
suspense
.
  
<EOS>
I
went
to
Mrs.
Jervis
's
chamber
;
and
,
O
dreadful
!
<EOS>
my
wicked
master
had
hid
himself
,
base
gentleman
as
he
is
!
<EOS>
in
her
closet
,
where
she
has
a
few
books
,
and
chest
of
drawers
,
and
such
like
.
 
<EOS>
I
little
suspected
it
;
though
I
used
,
till
this
sad
night
,
always
to
look
into
that
closet
and
another
in
the
room
,
and
under
the
bed
,
ever
since
the
summer
-
house
trick
;
but
never
found
any
thing
;
and
so
I
did
not
do
it
then
,
being
fully
resolved
to
be
angry
with
Mrs.
Jervis
for
what
had
happened
in
the
day
,
and
so
thought
of
nothing
else
.
  
<EOS>
I
sat
myself
down
on
one
side
of
the
bed
,
and
she
on
the
other
,
and
we
began
to
undress
ourselves
;
but
she
on
that
side
next
the
wicked
closet
,
that
held
the
worst
heart
in
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
said
Mrs.
Jervis
,
you
wo
n't
speak
to
me
,
Pamela
!
 
<EOS>
I
find
you
are
angry
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
Mrs.
Jervis
,
said
I
,
so
I
am
,
a
little
;
'
tis
a
folly
to
deny
it
.
 
<EOS>
You
see
what
I
have
suffered
by
your
forcing
me
in
to
my
master
:
and
a
gentlewoman
of
your
years
and
experience
must
needs
know
,
that
it
was
not
fit
for
me
to
pretend
to
be
any
body
else
for
my
own
sake
,
nor
with
regard
to
my
master
.
  
<EOS>
But
,
said
she
,
who
would
have
thought
it
would
have
turned
out
so
?
 
<EOS>
Ay
,
said
I
,
little
thinking
who
heard
me
,
Lucifer
always
is
ready
to
promote
his
own
work
and
workmen
.
 
<EOS>
You
see
presently
what
use
he
made
of
it
,
pretending
not
to
know
me
,
on
purpose
to
be
free
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
And
when
he
took
upon
himself
to
know
me
,
to
quarrel
with
me
,
and
use
me
hardly
:
<EOS>
And
you
too
,
said
I
,
to
cry
,
Fie
,
fie
,
Pamela
!
<EOS>
cut
me
to
the
heart
:
for
that
encouraged
him
.
  
<EOS>
Do
you
think
,
my
dear
,
said
she
,
that
I
would
encourage
him
?
 
<EOS>
I
never
said
so
to
you
before
;
but
,
since
you
have
forced
it
from
me
,
I
must
tell
you
,
that
,
ever
since
you
consulted
me
,
I
have
used
my
utmost
endeavours
to
divert
him
from
his
wicked
purposes
:
and
he
has
promised
fair
;
but
,
to
say
all
in
a
word
<EOS>
,
he
doats
upon
you
;
and
I
begin
to
see
it
is
not
in
his
power
to
help
it
.
  
<EOS>
I
luckily
said
nothing
of
the
note
from
Mr.
Jonathan
;
for
I
began
to
suspect
all
the
world
almost
:
<EOS>
but
I
said
,
to
try
Mrs.
Jervis
,
<EOS>
Well
then
,
what
would
you
have
me
do
?
 
<EOS>
You
see
he
is
for
having
me
wait
on
Lady
Davers
now
.
  
<EOS>
Why
,
I
'll
tell
you
freely
,
my
dear
Pamela
,
said
she
,
and
I
trust
to
your
discretion
to
conceal
what
I
say
:
my
master
has
been
often
desiring
me
to
put
you
upon
asking
him
to
let
you
stay
     
<EOS>
Yes
,
said
I
,
Mrs.
Jervis
,
let
me
interrupt
you
:
I
will
tell
you
why
I
could
not
think
of
that
:
It
was
not
the
pride
of
my
heart
,
but
the
pride
of
my
honesty
:
For
what
must
have
been
the
case
?
 
<EOS>
Here
my
master
has
been
very
rude
to
me
,
once
and
twice
;
and
you
say
he
can
not
help
it
,
though
he
pretends
to
be
sorry
for
it
:
<EOS>
Well
,
he
has
given
me
warning
to
leave
my
place
,
and
uses
me
very
harshly
;
perhaps
to
frighten
me
to
his
purposes
,
as
he
supposes
I
would
be
fond
of
staying
(
as
indeed
I
should
,
if
I
could
be
safe
;
for
I
love
you
and
all
the
house
,
and
value
him
,
if
he
would
act
as
my
master
)
.
 
<EOS>
Well
then
,
as
I
know
his
designs
,
and
that
he
owns
he
can
not
help
it
;
must
I
have
asked
to
stay
,
knowing
he
would
attempt
me
again
?
<EOS>
for
all
you
could
assure
me
of
,
was
,
he
would
do
nothing
by
force
;
so
I
,
a
poor
weak
girl
,
was
to
be
left
to
my
own
strength
!
 
<EOS>
And
was
not
this
to
allow
him
to
tempt
me
,
as
one
may
say
?
<EOS>
and
to
encourage
him
to
go
on
in
his
wicked
devices
?
 
<EOS>
How
then
,
Mrs.
Jervis
,
could
I
ask
or
wish
to
stay
?
  
<EOS>
You
say
<EOS>
well
,
my
dear
child
,
says
she
;
and
you
have
a
justness
of
thought
above
your
years
;
and
for
all
these
considerations
,
and
for
what
I
have
heard
this
day
,
after
you
ran
away
,
(
and
I
am
glad
you
went
as
you
did
,
)
<EOS>
I
can
not
persuade
you
to
stay
;
and
I
shall
be
glad
,
(
which
is
what
I
never
thought
I
could
have
said
,
)
that
you
were
well
at
your
father
's
;
for
if
Lady
Davers
will
entertain
you
<EOS>
,
she
may
as
well
have
you
from
thence
as
here
.
 
<EOS>
There
's
my
good
Mrs.
Jervis
!
<EOS>
said
I
;
God
will
bless
you
for
your
good
counsel
to
a
poor
maiden
,
that
is
hard
beset
.
 
<EOS>
But
pray
what
did
he
say
,
when
I
was
gone
?
 
<EOS>
Why
,
says
she
,
he
was
very
angry
with
you
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
would
hear
it
!
<EOS>
said
I
:
<EOS>
I
think
it
was
a
little
bold
;
but
then
he
provoked
me
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
And
had
not
my
honesty
been
in
the
case
<EOS>
,
I
would
not
by
any
means
have
been
so
saucy
.
 
<EOS>
Besides
,
Mrs.
Jervis
,
consider
it
was
the
truth
;
if
he
does
not
love
to
hear
of
the
summer
-
house
,
and
the
dressing
-
room
,
why
should
he
not
be
ashamed
to
continue
in
the
same
mind
?
 
<EOS>
But
,
said
she
,
when
you
had
muttered
this
to
yourself
,
you
might
have
told
him
any
thing
else
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
said
I
<EOS>
,
I
can
not
tell
a
wilful
lie
,
and
<EOS>
so
there
's
an
end
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
find
you
now
give
him
up
,
and
think
there
's
danger
in
staying
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
bless
me
!
 
<EOS>
I
wish
I
was
well
out
of
the
house
;
so
it
was
at
the
bottom
of
a
wet
ditch
,
on
the
wildest
common
in
England
.
  
<EOS>
Why
,
said
she
,
it
signifies
nothing
to
tell
you
all
he
said
<EOS>
but
it
was
enough
to
make
me
fear
you
would
not
be
so
safe
as
I
could
wish
;
and
,
upon
my
word
,
Pamela
,
I
do
n't
wonder
he
loves
you
;
<EOS>
for
,
without
flattery
,
you
are
a
charming
girl
!
<EOS>
and
I
never
saw
you
look
more
lovely
in
your
life
than
in
that
same
new
dress
of
yours
.
 
<EOS>
And
then
it
was
such
a
surprise
upon
us
all
!
 
<EOS>
I
believe
truly
,
you
owe
some
of
your
danger
to
the
lovely
appearance
you
made
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
said
I
,
I
wish
the
clothes
in
the
fire
:
<EOS>
I
expected
no
effect
from
them
;
but
,
if
any
,
a
quite
contrary
one
.
  
<EOS>
Hush
!
<EOS>
said
I
,
Mrs.
Jervis
,
did
you
not
hear
something
stir
in
the
closet
?
<EOS>
No
,
silly
girl
,
said
she
,
your
fears
are
always
awake
.
 
<EOS>
But
indeed
,
said
I
<EOS>
,
I
think
I
heard
something
rustle
.
 
<EOS>
May
be
,
says
she
,
the
cat
may
be
got
there
:
<EOS>
but
I
hear
nothing
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
hush
;
but
she
said
,
Pr'ythee
,
my
good
girl
,
make
haste
to
bed
.
 
<EOS>
See
if
the
door
be
fast
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
did
,
and
was
thinking
to
look
into
the
closet
;
<EOS>
but
,
hearing
no
more
noise
,
thought
it
needless
,
and
so
went
again
and
sat
myself
down
on
the
bed
-
side
,
and
went
on
undressing
myself
.
 
<EOS>
And
Mrs.
Jervis
being
by
this
time
undressed
,
stepped
into
bed
,
and
bid
me
hasten
,
for
she
was
sleepy
.
  
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
what
was
the
matter
,
but
my
heart
sadly
misgave
me
:
<EOS>
Indeed
,
Mr.
Jonathan
's
note
was
enough
to
make
it
do
so
,
with
what
Mrs.
Jervis
had
said
.
 
<EOS>
I
pulled
off
my
stays
,
and
my
stockings
,
and
all
my
clothes
to
an
under
-
petticoat
;
and
then
hearing
a
rustling
again
in
the
closet
,
I
said
,
Heaven
protect
us
!
<EOS>
but
before
I
say
my
prayers
,
I
must
look
into
this
closet
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
was
going
to
it
<EOS>
slip
-
shod
,
when
,
O
dreadful
!
<EOS>
out
rushed
my
master
in
a
rich
silk
and
silver
morning
gown
.
  
<EOS>
I
screamed
,
and
ran
to
the
bed
,
and
Mrs.
Jervis
screamed
too
;
and
he
said
,
I
'll
do
you
no
harm
,
if
you
forbear
this
noise
;
but
otherwise
take
what
follows
.
  
<EOS>
Instantly
he
came
to
the
bed
<EOS>
(
for
I
had
crept
into
it
,
to
Mrs.
Jervis
,
with
my
coat
on
,
and
my
shoes
)
;
and
taking
me
in
his
arms
,
said
,
Mrs.
Jervis
,
rise
,
and
just
step
up
stairs
to
keep
the
maids
from
coming
down
at
this
noise
:
<EOS>
I
'll
do
no
harm
to
this
rebel
.
  
<EOS>
O
,
for
Heaven
's
sake
!
<EOS>
for
pity
's
sake
!
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jervis
,
said
I
,
if
I
am
not
betrayed
,
do
n't
leave
me
;
and
,
I
beseech
you
,
raise
all
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
said
Mrs.
Jervis
,
I
will
not
stir
,
my
dear
lamb
;
I
will
not
leave
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
wonder
at
you
,
sir
,
said
she
;
and
kindly
threw
herself
upon
my
coat
,
clasping
me
round
the
waist
:
<EOS>
You
shall
not
hurt
this
innocent
,
said
she
:
for
I
will
lose
my
life
in
her
defence
.
 
<EOS>
Are
there
not
,
said
she
,
enough
wicked
ones
in
the
world
,
for
your
base
purpose
,
but
you
must
attempt
such
a
lamb
as
this
?
  
<EOS>
He
was
desperate
angry
,
and
threatened
to
throw
her
out
of
the
window
;
and
to
turn
her
out
of
the
house
the
next
morning
.
 
<EOS>
You
need
not
,
sir
,
said
she
;
for
I
will
not
stay
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
God
defend
my
poor
Pamela
till
to
-
morrow
,
and
we
will
both
go
together
.
 
<EOS>
Says
he
<EOS>
,
let
me
but
expostulate
a
word
or
two
with
you
,
Pamela
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
,
Pamela
,
said
Mrs.
Jervis
,
do
n't
hear
a
word
,
except
he
leaves
the
bed
,
and
goes
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
Ay
,
out
of
the
room
,
said
I
;
expostulate
to
-
morrow
,
if
you
must
expostulate
!
  
<EOS>
I
found
his
hand
in
my
bosom
;
and
when
my
fright
let
me
know
it
,
I
was
ready
to
die
;
and
I
sighed
and
screamed
,
and
fainted
away
.
 
<EOS>
And
still
he
had
his
arms
about
my
neck
;
and
Mrs.
Jervis
was
about
my
feet
,
and
upon
my
coat
.
 
<EOS>
And
all
in
a
cold
dewy
sweat
was
I.
 
Pamela
!
<EOS>
Pamela
!
<EOS>
said
Mrs.
Jervis
,
as
she
tells
me
since
,
O####h
,
and
gave
another
shriek
,
my
poor
Pamela
is
dead
for
certain
!
 
<EOS>
And
so
,
to
be
sure
,
I
was
for
a
time
;
for
I
knew
nothing
more
of
the
matter
,
one
fit
following
another
,
till
about
three
hours
after
,
as
it
proved
to
be
,
I
found
myself
in
bed
,
and
Mrs.
Jervis
sitting
upon
one
side
,
with
her
wrapper
about
her
,
and
Rachel
on
the
other
;
and
no
master
,
for
the
wicked
wretch
was
gone
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
was
so
overjoyed
,
that
I
hardly
could
believe
myself
;
and
I
said
,
which
were
my
first
words
,
Mrs.
Jervis
,
Mrs.
Rachel
,
can
I
be
sure
it
is
you
?
 
<EOS>
Tell
me
!
<EOS>
can
I
?
 
<EOS>
Where
have
I
been
?
 
<EOS>
Hush
,
my
dear
,
said
Mrs.
Jervis
;
you
have
been
in
fit
after
fit
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
saw
any
body
so
frightful
in
my
life
!
  
<EOS>
By
this
I
judged
Rachel
knew
nothing
of
the
matter
;
and
it
seems
my
wicked
master
had
,
upon
Mrs.
Jervis
's
second
noise
on
my
fainting
away
,
slipt
out
,
and
,
as
if
he
had
come
from
his
own
chamber
,
disturbed
by
the
screaming
,
went
up
to
the
maids
'
room
,
(
who
,
hearing
the
noise
,
lay
trembling
,
and
afraid
to
stir
,
)
and
bid
them
go
down
,
and
see
what
was
the
matter
with
Mrs.
Jervis
and
me
.
 
<EOS>
And
he
charged
Mrs.
Jervis
,
and
promised
to
forgive
her
for
what
she
had
said
and
done
,
if
she
would
conceal
the
matter
.
 
<EOS>
So
the
maids
came
down
,
and
all
went
up
again
,
when
I
came
to
myself
a
little
,
except
Rachel
,
who
staid
to
sit
up
with
me
,
and
bear
Mrs.
Jervis
company
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
they
all
guess
the
matter
to
be
bad
enough
;
though
they
dare
not
say
any
thing
.
  
<EOS>
When
I
think
of
my
danger
,
and
the
freedoms
he
actually
took
,
though
I
believe
Mrs.
Jervis
saved
me
from
worse
,
and
she
said
she
did
,
(
though
what
can
I
think
,
who
was
in
a
fit
,
and
knew
nothing
of
the
matter
?
)
<EOS>
I
am
almost
distracted
.
  
<EOS>
At
first
I
was
afraid
of
Mrs.
Jervis
;
but
I
am
fully
satisfied
<EOS>
she
is
very
good
,
and
I
should
have
been
lost
but
for
her
;
and
she
takes
on
grievously
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
What
would
have
become
of
me
,
had
she
gone
out
of
the
room
,
to
still
the
maids
,
as
he
bid
her
!
 
<EOS>
He
'd
certainly
have
shut
her
out
,
and
then
,
mercy
on
me
!
<EOS>
what
would
have
become
of
your
poor
Pamela
?
  
<EOS>
I
must
leave
off
a
little
;
for
my
eyes
and
my
head
are
sadly
bad
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
a
dreadful
trial
!
 
<EOS>
This
was
the
worst
of
all
!
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
that
I
was
out
of
the
power
of
this
dreadfully
wicked
man
!
 
<EOS>
Pray
for
                                             
Your
distressed
DAUGHTER
.
    
<EOS>
MY
DEAR
FATHER
AND
MOTHER
,
  
I
did
not
rise
till
ten
o'clock
,
and
I
had
all
the
concerns
and
wishes
of
the
family
,
and
multitudes
of
inquiries
about
me
.
 
<EOS>
My
wicked
master
went
out
early
to
hunt
;
but
left
word
he
would
be
in
to
breakfast
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
he
was
.
  
<EOS>
He
came
up
to
our
chamber
about
eleven
,
and
had
nothing
to
do
to
be
sorry
;
for
he
was
our
master
,
and
so
put
on
sharp
anger
at
first
.
  
<EOS>
I
had
great
emotions
at
his
entering
the
room
,
and
threw
my
apron
over
my
head
,
and
fell
a
crying
,
as
if
my
heart
would
break
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jervis
,
said
he
,
since
I
know
you
,
and
you
me
<EOS>
so
well
,
I
do
n't
know
how
we
shall
live
together
for
the
future
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
said
she
,
I
will
take
the
liberty
to
say
,
what
I
think
is
best
for
both
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
so
much
grief
,
that
you
should
attempt
to
do
any
injury
to
this
poor
girl
,
and
especially
in
my
chamber
,
that
I
should
think
myself
accessary
to
the
mischief
,
if
I
was
not
to
take
notice
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
Though
my
ruin
,
therefore
,
may
depend
upon
it
,
<EOS>
I
desire
not
to
stay
;
but
pray
let
poor
Pamela
and
me
go
together
.
 
<EOS>
With
all
my
heart
,
said
he
;
and
the
sooner
the
better
.
 
<EOS>
She
fell
a
crying
.
 
<EOS>
I
find
,
says
he
,
this
girl
has
made
a
party
of
the
whole
house
in
her
favour
against
me
.
 
<EOS>
Her
innocence
deserves
it
of
us
all
,
said
she
very
kindly
:
and
I
never
could
have
thought
that
the
son
of
my
dear
good
lady
departed
,
could
have
so
forfeited
his
honour
,
as
to
endeavour
to
destroy
a
virtue
he
ought
to
protect
.
 
<EOS>
No
more
of
this
,
Mrs.
Jervis
!
<EOS>
said
he
;
I
will
not
hear
it
.
 
<EOS>
As
for
Pamela
,
she
has
a
lucky
knack
of
falling
into
fits
,
when
she
pleases
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
cursed
yellings
of
you
both
made
me
not
myself
.
 
<EOS>
I
intended
no
harm
to
her
,
as
I
told
you
both
,
if
you
'd
have
left
your
squallings
:
<EOS>
And
I
did
no
harm
neither
,
but
to
myself
;
for
I
raised
a
hornet
's
nest
about
my
ears
,
that
,
as
far
as
I
know
,
may
have
stung
to
death
my
reputation
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
said
Mrs.
Jervis
,
then
I
beg
Mr.
Longman
may
take
my
accounts
,
and
I
will
go
away
as
soon
as
I
can
.
 
<EOS>
As
for
Pamela
,
she
is
at
her
liberty
,
I
hope
,
to
go
away
next
Thursday
,
as
she
intends
?
  
<EOS>
I
sat
still
;
for
I
could
not
speak
nor
look
up
,
and
his
presence
discomposed
me
extremely
;
but
I
was
sorry
to
hear
myself
the
unhappy
occasion
of
Mrs.
Jervis
's
losing
her
place
,
and
hope
that
may
be
still
made
up
.
  
<EOS>
Well
,
said
he
,
let
Mr.
Longman
make
up
your
accounts
,
as
soon
as
you
will
;
and
Mrs.
Jewkes
(
who
is
his
housekeeper
in
Lincolnshire
)
shall
come
hither
in
your
place
,
and
wo
n't
be
less
obliging
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
,
than
you
have
been
.
 
<EOS>
Said
she
<EOS>
,
I
have
never
disobliged
you
till
now
;
and
let
me
tell
you
,
sir
,
if
you
knew
what
belonged
to
your
own
reputation
or
honour
 
<EOS>
No
more
,
no
more
,
said
he
,
of
these
antiquated
topics
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
no
bad
friend
to
you
;
and
I
shall
always
esteem
you
,
though
you
have
not
been
so
faithful
to
my
secrets
as
I
could
have
wished
,
and
have
laid
me
open
to
this
girl
,
which
has
made
her
more
afraid
of
me
than
she
had
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
sir
,
said
she
,
after
what
passed
yesterday
,
and
last
night
,
I
think
I
went
rather
too
far
in
favour
of
your
injunctions
than
otherwise
;
and
I
should
have
deserved
every
body
's
censure
,
as
the
basest
of
creatures
,
had
I
been
capable
of
contributing
to
your
lawless
attempts
.
 
<EOS>
Still
,
Mrs.
Jervis
,
still
reflecting
upon
me
,
and
all
for
imaginary
faults
!
<EOS>
for
what
harm
have
I
done
the
girl
?
 
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
bear
it
,
I
'll
assure
you
.
 
<EOS>
But
yet
,
in
respect
to
my
mother
,
I
am
willing
to
part
friendly
with
you
though
you
ought
both
of
you
to
reflect
on
the
freedom
of
your
conversation
,
in
relation
to
me
;
which
I
should
have
resented
more
than
I
do
,
but
that
I
am
conscious
I
had
no
business
to
demean
myself
so
as
to
be
in
your
closet
,
where
I
might
have
expected
to
hear
a
multitude
of
impertinence
between
you
.
  
<EOS>
Well
,
sir
,
said
she
,
you
have
no
objection
,
I
hope
,
to
Pamela
's
going
away
on
Thursday
next
?
 
<EOS>
You
are
mighty
solicitous
,
said
he
,
about
Pamela
:
<EOS>
But
no
,
not
I
;
let
her
go
as
soon
as
she
will
:
<EOS>
She
is
a
naughty
girl
,
and
has
brought
all
this
upon
herself
;
and
upon
me
more
trouble
than
she
can
have
had
from
me
:
<EOS>
But
I
have
overcome
it
all
,
and
will
never
concern
myself
about
her
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
a
proposal
made
me
,
added
he
,
since
I
have
been
out
this
morning
,
that
I
shall
go
near
to
embrace
;
and
so
wish
only
,
that
a
discreet
use
may
be
made
of
what
is
past
;
and
there
's
an
end
of
every
thing
with
me
,
as
to
Pamela
<EOS>
,
I
'll
assure
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
clasped
my
hands
together
through
my
apron
,
overjoyed
at
this
,
though
I
was
soon
to
go
away
:
For
,
naughty
as
he
has
been
to
me
,
I
wish
his
prosperity
with
all
my
heart
,
for
my
good
old
lady
's
sake
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
Pamela
,
said
he
,
you
need
not
now
be
afraid
to
speak
to
me
;
tell
me
what
you
lifted
up
your
hands
at
?
 
<EOS>
I
said
not
a
word
.
 
<EOS>
Says
he
,
If
you
like
what
I
have
said
,
give
me
your
hand
upon
it
.
<EOS>
I
held
my
hand
up
through
my
apron
;
for
I
could
not
speak
to
him
;
and
he
took
hold
of
it
,
and
pressed
it
,
though
less
hard
than
he
did
my
arm
the
day
before
.
 
<EOS>
What
does
the
little
fool
cover
her
face
for
?
<EOS>
said
he
:
<EOS>
Pull
your
apron
away
;
and
let
me
see
how
you
look
,
after
your
freedom
of
speech
of
me
last
night
.
 
<EOS>
No
wonder
you
are
ashamed
to
see
me
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
you
were
very
free
with
my
character
.
  
<EOS>
I
could
not
stand
this
barbarous
insult
,
as
I
took
it
to
be
,
considering
his
behaviour
to
me
;
and
I
then
spoke
and
said
,
O
<EOS>
the
difference
between
the
minds
of
thy
creatures
,
good
God
!
 
<EOS>
How
shall
some
be
cast
down
in
their
innocence
,
while
others
can
triumph
in
their
guilt
!
  
<EOS>
And
so
saying
,
I
went
up
stairs
to
my
chamber
,
and
wrote
all
this
<EOS>
;
for
though
he
vexed
me
at
his
taunting
,
yet
I
was
pleased
to
hear
he
was
likely
to
be
married
,
and
that
his
wicked
intentions
were
so
happily
overcome
as
to
me
;
and
this
made
me
a
little
easier
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
hope
I
have
passed
the
worst
;
or
else
it
is
very
hard
.
 
<EOS>
And
yet
I
sha
n't
think
myself
at
ease
quite
,
till
I
am
with
you
:
<EOS>
For
,
methinks
,
after
all
,
his
repentance
and
amendment
are
mighty
suddenly
resolved
upon
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
divine
grace
is
not
confined
to
space
;
and
remorse
may
,
and
I
hope
has
,
smitten
him
to
the
heart
at
once
,
for
his
injuries
to
poor
me
!
 
<EOS>
Yet
I
wo
n't
be
too
secure
neither
.
  
<EOS>
Having
opportunity
,
I
send
now
what
I
know
will
grieve
you
to
the
heart
.
<EOS>
But
I
hope
I
shall
bring
my
next
scribble
myself
;
and
so
conclude
,
though
half
broken
-
hearted
,
                     
Your
ever
dutiful
DAUGHTER
.
    
<EOS>
DEAR
FATHER
AND
MOTHER
,
  
<EOS>
I
am
glad
I
desired
you
not
to
meet
me
,
and
John
says
you
wo
n't
;
for
he
told
you
he
is
sure
I
shall
get
a
passage
well
enough
,
either
behind
some
one
of
my
fellow
-
servants
on
horseback
,
or
by
farmer
Nichols
's
means
:
<EOS>
but
as
to
the
chariot
he
talked
to
you
of
,
I
ca
n't
expect
that
favour
,
to
be
sure
;
and
I
should
not
care
for
it
,
because
it
would
look
so
much
above
me
.
 
<EOS>
But
farmer
Brady
,
they
say
,
has
a
chaise
with
one
horse
,
and
we
hope
to
borrow
that
,
or
hire
it
,
rather
than
fail
;
though
money
runs
a
little
lowish
,
after
what
I
have
laid
out
;
but
I
do
n't
care
to
say
so
here
;
though
I
warrant
I
might
have
what
I
would
of
Mrs.
Jervis
,
or
Mr.
Jonathan
,
or
Mr.
Longman
;
but
then
how
shall
I
pay
it
?
<EOS>
you
'll
say
:
<EOS>
And
,
besides
,
I
do
n't
love
to
be
beholden
.
  
<EOS>
But
the
chief
reason
I
'm
glad
you
do
n't
set
out
to
meet
me
,
is
the
uncertainty
;
for
it
seems
I
must
stay
another
week
still
,
and
hope
certainly
to
go
Thursday
after
.
 
<EOS>
For
poor
Mrs.
Jervis
will
go
at
the
same
time
,
she
says
,
and
ca
n't
be
ready
before
.
  
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
that
I
was
once
well
with
you
!
 
<EOS>
Though
he
is
very
civil
too
at
present
,
and
not
so
cross
as
he
was
:
and
yet
he
is
as
vexatious
another
way
,
as
you
shall
hear
.
 
<EOS>
For
yesterday
he
had
a
rich
suit
of
clothes
brought
home
,
<EOS>
which
they
call
a
birth
-
day
suit
;
for
he
intends
to
go
to
London
against
next
birth
-
day
,
to
see
the
court
;
and
our
folks
will
have
it
<EOS>
he
is
to
be
made
a
lord
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
they
may
make
him
an
honest
man
,
as
he
was
always
thought
;
but
I
have
not
found
it
so
,
alas
for
me
!
  
<EOS>
And
so
,
as
I
was
saying
,
he
had
these
clothes
come
home
,
and
he
tried
them
on
.
 
<EOS>
And
before
he
pulled
them
off
,
he
sent
for
me
,
when
nobody
else
was
in
the
parlour
with
him
:
<EOS>
Pamela
,
said
he
,
you
are
so
neat
and
so
nice
in
your
own
dress
,
(
<EOS>
Alack
-
a
-
day
,
I
did
n't
know
I
was
!
)
<EOS>
that
you
must
be
a
judge
of
ours
.
 
<EOS>
How
are
these
clothes
made
?
 
<EOS>
Do
they
fit
me
?
 
<EOS>
I
am
no
judge
,
said
I
,
and
please
your
honour
;
but
I
think
they
look
very
fine
.
  
<EOS>
His
waistcoat
stood
on
end
with
silver
lace
,
and
he
looked
very
grand
.
<EOS>
But
what
he
did
last
,
has
made
me
very
serious
,
and
I
could
make
him
no
compliments
.
 
<EOS>
Said
he
,
Why
do
n't
you
wear
your
usual
clothes
?
 
<EOS>
Though
I
think
every
thing
looks
well
upon
you
(
for
I
still
continue
in
my
new
dress
)
.
 
<EOS>
I
said
,
I
have
no
clothes
,
<EOS>
sir
,
I
ought
to
call
my
own
,
but
these
:
<EOS>
and
it
is
no
matter
<EOS>
what
such
an
one
as
I
wears
.
 
<EOS>
Said
he
<EOS>
,
Why
you
look
very
serious
,
Pamela
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
you
can
bear
malice
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
so
I
can
,
sir
,
said
I
,
according
to
the
occasion
!
 
<EOS>
Why
,
said
he
,
<EOS>
your
eyes
always
look
red
,
I
think
.
 
<EOS>
Are
you
not
a
fool
to
take
my
last
freedom
so
much
to
heart
?
 
<EOS>
I
am
sure
you
,
and
that
fool
Mrs.
Jervis
,
frightened
me
,
by
your
hideous
squalling
,
as
much
as
I
could
frighten
you
.
 
<EOS>
That
is
all
we
had
for
it
,
said
I
;
and
if
you
could
be
so
afraid
of
your
own
servants
knowing
of
your
attempts
upon
a
poor
unworthy
creature
,
that
is
under
your
protection
while
I
stay
,
surely
your
honour
ought
to
be
more
afraid
of
God
Almighty
,
in
whose
presence
we
all
stand
,
in
every
action
of
our
lives
,
and
to
whom
the
greatest
,
as
well
as
the
least
,
must
be
accountable
,
let
them
think
what
they
list
.
  
<EOS>
He
took
my
hand
,
in
a
kind
of
good
-
humoured
mockery
,
and
said
,
Well
urged
,
my
pretty
preacher
!
 
<EOS>
When
my
Lincolnshire
chaplain
dies
,
I
'll
put
thee
on
a
gown
and
cassock
,
and
thou'lt
make
a
good
figure
in
his
place
.
  
<EOS>
I
 
wish
,
said
I
,
a
little
vexed
at
his
jeer
,
your
honour
's
conscience
would
be
your
preacher
,
and
then
you
would
need
no
other
chaplain
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
well
,
Pamela
,
said
he
,
no
more
of
this
unfashionable
jargon
.
 
<EOS>
I
did
not
send
for
you
so
much
for
your
opinion
of
my
new
suit
,
as
to
tell
you
,
you
are
welcome
to
stay
,
since
Mrs.
Jervis
desires
it
,
till
she
goes
.
 
<EOS>
I
welcome
!
<EOS>
said
I
;
I
am
sure
I
shall
rejoice
when
I
am
out
of
the
house
!
  
<EOS>
Well
,
said
he
,
you
are
an
ungrateful
baggage
;
but
I
am
thinking
it
would
be
pity
,
with
these
fair
soft
hands
,
and
that
lovely
skin
,
(
as
he
called
it
,
and
took
hold
of
my
hand
,
)
that
you
should
return
again
to
hard
work
,
as
you
must
if
you
go
to
your
father
's
;
and
so
I
would
advise
her
to
take
a
house
in
London
,
and
let
lodgings
to
us
members
of
parliament
,
when
we
come
to
town
;
and
such
a
pretty
daughter
as
you
may
pass
for
,
will
always
fill
her
house
,
and
she
'll
get
a
great
deal
of
money
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
sadly
vexed
at
this
barbarous
joke
;
but
being
ready
to
cry
before
,
the
tears
gushed
out
,
and
(
endeavouring
to
get
my
hand
from
him
,
but
in
vain
)
<EOS>
I
said
,
I
can
expect
no
better
:
<EOS>
Your
behaviour
,
sir
,
to
me
,
has
been
just
of
a
piece
with
these
words
:
<EOS>
Nay
,
I
will
say
it
,
though
you
were
to
be
ever
so
angry
.
 
<EOS>
I
angry
,
Pamela
?
 
<EOS>
No
,
no
,
said
he
,
I
have
overcome
all
that
;
and
as
you
are
to
go
away
,
I
look
upon
you
now
as
Mrs.
Jervis
's
guest
while
you
both
stay
,
and
not
as
my
servant
;
and
so
you
may
say
what
you
will
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
'll
tell
you
,
Pamela
,
why
you
need
not
take
this
matter
in
such
high
disdain
!
 
<EOS>
You
have
a
very
pretty
romantic
turn
for
virtue
,
and
all
that
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
do
n't
suppose
<EOS>
but
you
'll
hold
it
still
:
and
nobody
will
be
able
to
prevail
upon
you
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
my
child
,
(
sneeringly
he
spoke
it
,
)
do
but
consider
what
a
fine
opportunity
you
will
then
have
for
a
tale
every
day
to
good
mother
Jervis
,
and
what
subjects
for
letter
-
writing
to
your
father
and
mother
,
and
what
pretty
preachments
you
may
hold
forth
to
the
young
gentlemen
.
 
<EOS>
Ad
's
my
heart
!
 
<EOS>
I
think
it
would
be
the
best
thing
<EOS>
you
and
she
could
do
.
  
<EOS>
You
do
well
<EOS>
,
sir
,
said
I
,
to
even
your
wit
to
such
a
poor
maiden
as
me
:
<EOS>
but
,
permit
me
to
say
,
that
if
you
was
not
rich
and
great
,
and
I
poor
and
little
,
you
would
not
insult
me
thus
.
 
<EOS>
Let
me
ask
you
,
sir
,
if
you
think
this
becomes
your
fine
clothes
,
and
a
master
's
station
:
<EOS>
Why
so
serious
,
my
pretty
Pamela
?
<EOS>
said
he
:
<EOS>
Why
so
grave
?
 
<EOS>
And
would
kiss
me
;
but
my
heart
was
full
,
and
I
said
,
Let
me
alone
;
I
will
tell
you
,
if
you
was
a
king
,
and
insulted
me
as
you
have
done
,
that
you
have
forgotten
to
act
like
a
gentleman
;
and
I
wo
n't
stay
to
be
used
thus
:
I
will
go
to
the
next
farmer
's
,
and
there
wait
for
Mrs.
Jervis
,
if
she
must
go
:
<EOS>
and
I
'd
have
you
know
,
sir
,
that
I
can
stoop
to
the
ordinariest
work
of
your
scullions
,
for
all
these
nasty
soft
hands
,
sooner
than
bear
such
ungentlemanly
imputations
.
  
<EOS>
I
sent
for
you
,
said
he
,
in
high
good
humour
;
but
it
is
impossible
to
hold
it
with
such
an
impertinent
:
however
,
I
'll
keep
my
temper
.
 
<EOS>
But
while
I
see
you
here
,
pray
do
n't
put
on
those
dismal
grave
<EOS>
looks
:
Why
,
girl
,
you
should
forbear
them
,
if
it
were
but
for
your
pride
-
sake
;
for
the
family
will
think
you
are
grieving
to
leave
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
sir
,
said
I
,
I
will
try
to
convince
them
of
the
contrary
,
as
well
as
your
honour
;
for
I
will
endeavour
to
be
more
cheerful
while
I
stay
,
for
that
very
reason
.
  
<EOS>
Well
,
replied
he
,
I
will
set
this
down
by
itself
,
as
the
first
time
that
ever
what
I
had
advised
had
any
weight
with
you
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
will
add
,
said
I
,
as
the
first
advice
you
have
given
me
of
late
,
that
was
fit
to
be
followed
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
said
he
,
(
I
am
almost
ashamed
to
write
it
,
impudent
gentleman
as
he
is
!
)
<EOS>
I
wish
I
had
thee
as
quick
another
way
,
as
thou
art
in
thy
repartees
 
<EOS>
And
he
laughed
,
and
I
snatched
my
hand
from
him
,
and
I
tripped
away
as
fast
as
I
could
.
 
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
thought
I
,
married
?
 
<EOS>
I
am
sure
it
is
time
you
were
married
,
or
,
at
this
rate
,
no
honest
maiden
ought
to
live
with
you
.
  
<EOS>
Why
,
dear
father
and
mother
,
to
be
sure
he
grows
quite
a
rake
!
 
<EOS>
How
easy
it
is
to
go
from
bad
to
worse
,
when
once
people
give
way
to
vice
!
  
<EOS>
How
would
my
poor
lady
,
had
she
lived
,
have
grieved
to
see
it
!
<EOS>
but
may
be
he
would
have
been
better
then
!
 
<EOS>
Though
it
seems
he
told
Mrs.
Jervis
,
he
had
an
eye
upon
me
in
his
mother
's
life
-
time
;
and
he
intended
to
let
me
know
as
much
,
by
the
bye
,
he
told
her
!
 
<EOS>
Here
is
shamelessness
for
you
!
<EOS>
Sure
the
world
must
be
near
at
an
end
!
<EOS>
for
all
the
gentlemen
about
are
as
bad
as
he
almost
,
as
far
as
I
can
hear
!
 
<EOS>
And
see
the
fruits
of
such
bad
examples
!
 
<EOS>
There
is
"
Squire
Martin
in
the
grove
,
has
had
three
lyings
-
<EOS>
in
,
it
seems
,
in
his
house
,
in
three
months
past
;
one
by
himself
;
and
one
by
his
coachman
;
and
one
by
his
woodman
;
and
yet
he
has
turned
none
of
them
away
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
<EOS>
,
how
can
he
,
when
they
but
follow
his
own
vile
example
?
<EOS>
There
is
he
,
and
two
or
three
more
such
as
he
,
within
ten
miles
of
us
,
who
keep
company
,
and
hunt
with
our
fine
master
,
truly
;
and
I
suppose
he
is
never
the
better
for
their
examples
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
Heaven
bless
me
,
say
I
,
and
send
me
out
of
this
wicked
house
!
  
<EOS>
But
,
dear
father
and
mother
,
what
sort
of
creatures
must
the
womenkind
be
,
do
you
think
,
to
give
way
to
such
wickedness
?
 
<EOS>
Why
,
this
it
is
that
makes
every
one
be
thought
of
alike
:
<EOS>
And
,
alack
-
a
-
day
!
<EOS>
what
a
world
we
live
in
!
<EOS>
for
it
is
grown
more
a
wonder
that
the
men
are
resisted
,
than
that
the
women
comply
.
 
<EOS>
This
,
I
suppose
,
makes
me
such
a
sauce
-
box
,
and
bold
-
face
,
and
a
creature
,
and
all
because
I
wo
n't
be
a
sauce
-
box
and
bold
-
face
indeed
.
  
<EOS>
But
I
am
sorry
for
these
things
;
one
do
n't
know
what
arts
and
stratagems
men
may
devise
to
gain
their
vile
ends
;
and
so
I
will
think
as
well
as
I
can
of
these
poor
undone
creatures
,
and
pity
them
.
 
<EOS>
For
you
see
,
by
my
sad
story
,
and
<EOS>
narrow
escapes
,
what
hardships
poor
maidens
go
through
,
whose
lot
it
is
to
go
out
to
service
,
especially
to
houses
where
there
is
not
the
fear
of
God
,
and
good
rule
kept
by
the
heads
of
the
family
.
  
<EOS>
You
see
I
am
quite
grown
grave
and
serious
;
indeed
it
becomes
the
present
condition
of
                          
Your
dutiful
DAUGHTER
.
    
<EOS>
DEAR
FATHER
AND
MOTHER
<EOS>
,
  
John
says
you
wept
when
you
read
my
last
letter
,
that
he
carried
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
sorry
you
let
him
see
that
;
for
they
all
mistrust
already
how
matters
are
,
and
as
it
is
no
credit
that
I
have
been
attempted
,
though
it
is
that
I
have
resisted
;
yet
I
am
sorry
they
have
cause
to
think
so
evil
of
my
master
from
any
of
us
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jervis
has
made
up
her
accounts
with
Mr.
Longman
,
and
will
stay
in
her
place
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
glad
of
it
,
for
her
own
sake
,
and
for
my
master
's
;
for
she
has
a
good
master
of
him
;
so
indeed
all
have
,
but
poor
me
 
<EOS>
and
he
has
a
good
housekeeper
in
her
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Longman
,
it
seems
,
took
upon
him
to
talk
to
my
master
,
how
faithful
and
careful
of
his
interests
she
was
,
and
how
exact
in
her
accounts
;
and
he
told
him
,
there
was
no
comparison
between
her
accounts
and
Mrs.
Jewkes
's
,
at
the
Lincolnshire
estate
.
  
<EOS>
He
said
so
many
fine
things
<EOS>
,
it
seems
,
of
Mrs.
Jervis
,
that
my
master
sent
for
her
in
Mr.
Longman
's
presence
,
and
said
Pamela
might
come
along
with
her
;
I
suppose
to
mortify
me
,
that
I
must
go
while
she
was
to
stay
:
<EOS>
But
as
,
when
I
go
away
,
I
am
not
to
go
with
her
,
nor
was
she
to
go
with
me
;
so
I
did
not
matter
it
much
;
only
it
would
have
been
creditable
to
such
a
poor
girl
,
that
the
housekeeper
would
bear
me
company
,
if
I
went
.
  
<EOS>
Said
he
to
her
,
<EOS>
Well
,
Mrs.
Jervis
,
Longman
says
you
have
made
up
your
accounts
with
him
with
your
usual
fidelity
and
exactness
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
a
good
mind
to
make
you
an
offer
of
continuing
with
me
,
if
you
can
be
a
little
sorry
for
your
hasty
words
,
which
,
indeed
,
were
not
so
respectful
as
I
have
deserved
at
your
hands
.
 
<EOS>
She
seemed
at
a
sad
loss
what
to
say
,
because
Mr.
Longman
was
there
,
and
she
could
not
speak
of
the
occasion
of
those
words
,
which
was
me
.
  
<EOS>
Indeed
,
said
Mr.
Longman
,
<EOS>
I
must
needs
say
before
your
face
,
that
since
I
have
known
my
master
's
family
,
I
have
never
found
such
good
management
in
it
,
nor
so
much
love
and
harmony
neither
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
the
Lincolnshire
estate
was
as
well
served
!
 
<EOS>
No
more
of
that
,
said
my
master
;
but
Mrs.
Jervis
may
stay
,
if
she
will
:
and
here
,
Mrs.
Jervis
,
pray
accept
of
this
,
which
at
the
close
of
every
year
's
accounts
I
will
present
you
with
,
besides
your
salary
,
as
long
as
I
find
your
care
so
useful
and
agreeable
.
 
<EOS>
And
he
gave
her
five
guineas
.
 
<EOS>
She
made
him
a
low
courtesy
,
and
thanking
him
,
looked
to
me
,
as
if
she
would
have
spoken
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
He
took
her
meaning
,
I
believe
;
for
he
said
,
 
Indeed
I
love
to
encourage
merit
and
obligingness
,
Longman
;
but
I
can
never
be
equally
kind
to
those
who
do
n't
deserve
it
at
my
hands
,
as
to
those
who
do
;
and
then
he
looked
full
on
me
.
 
<EOS>
Longman
,
continued
he
,
I
said
that
girl
might
come
in
with
Mrs.
Jervis
,
because
they
love
to
be
always
together
.
 
<EOS>
For
Mrs.
Jervis
is
very
good
to
her
,
and
loves
her
as
well
as
if
she
was
her
daughter
.
 
<EOS>
But
else
 
Mr.
Longman
,
interrupting
him
,
said
,
Good
to
Mrs.
Pamela
!
 
<EOS>
Ay
,
sir
,
and
so
she
is
,
to
be
sure
!
 
<EOS>
But
every
body
must
be
good
to
her
;
for
     
He
was
going
on
:
but
my
master
said
,
No
more
,
no
more
,
Mr.
Longman
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
old
men
are
taken
with
pretty
young
girls
,
as
well
as
other
folks
;
and
fair
looks
hide
many
a
fault
,
where
a
person
has
the
art
to
behave
obligingly
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
and
please
your
honour
,
said
Mr.
Longman
,
every
body
 
and
was
going
on
,
I
believe
,
to
say
something
more
in
my
praise
,
but
he
interrupted
him
,
and
said
,
Not
a
word
more
of
this
Pamela
.
 
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
let
her
stay
<EOS>
,
I
'll
assure
you
;
not
only
for
her
own
freedom
of
speech
,
but
her
letter
-
writing
of
all
the
secrets
of
my
family
.
 
<EOS>
Ay
,
said
the
good
old
man
,
I
am
sorry
for
that
too
!
 
<EOS>
But
,
sir
,
 
No
more
,
I
say
,
said
my
master
;
for
my
reputation
is
so
well
known
,
(
mighty
fine
,
thought
I
!
)
<EOS>
that
I
care
not
what
any
body
writes
or
says
of
me
:
<EOS>
But
to
tell
you
the
truth
,
(
not
that
it
need
go
further
,
)
<EOS>
I
think
of
changing
my
condition
soon
;
and
,
you
know
,
young
ladies
of
birth
and
fortune
will
choose
their
own
servants
,
and
that
's
my
chief
reason
why
Pamela
ca
n't
stay
.
 
<EOS>
As
for
the
rest
,
said
he
,
the
girl
is
a
good
sort
of
body
,
take
her
altogether
;
though
I
must
needs
say
,
a
little
pert
,
since
my
mother
's
death
,
in
her
answers
,
and
gives
me
two
words
for
one
;
which
I
ca
n't
bear
;
nor
is
there
reason
<EOS>
I
should
,
you
know
,
Longman
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
to
be
sure
,
sir
,
said
he
:
<EOS>
but
'
tis
strange
,
methinks
,
she
should
be
so
mild
and
meek
to
every
one
of
us
in
the
house
,
and
forget
herself
so
,
where
she
should
shew
most
respect
!
<EOS>
Very
true
,
Mr.
Longman
,
said
he
,
but
<EOS>
so
it
is
,
I
'll
assure
you
;
and
it
was
from
her
pertness
,
that
Mrs.
Jervis
and
I
had
the
words
:
<EOS>
And
I
should
mind
it
the
less
,
but
that
the
girl
(
there
she
stands
,
I
say
it
to
her
face
)
has
wit
and
sense
above
her
years
,
and
knows
better
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
in
great
pain
to
say
something
,
but
yet
I
knew
not
<EOS>
what
,
before
Mr.
Longman
;
and
Mrs.
Jervis
looked
at
me
,
and
walked
to
the
window
to
hide
her
concern
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
,
I
said
,
It
is
for
you
,
sir
,
to
say
what
you
please
;
and
for
me
only
to
say
,
God
bless
your
honour
!
  
<EOS>
Poor
Mr.
Longman
faltered
in
his
speech
,
and
was
ready
to
cry
.
 
<EOS>
Said
my
insulting
master
to
me
,
Why
,
pr'ythee
,
Pamela
,
now
,
shew
thyself
as
thou
art
,
before
Longman
.
 
<EOS>
Can'st
not
give
him
a
specimen
of
that
pertness
which
thou
hast
exercised
upon
me
sometimes
?
  
<EOS>
Did
he
not
,
my
dear
father
and
mother
,
deserve
all
the
truth
to
be
told
?
<EOS>
Yet
I
overcame
myself
so
far
,
as
to
say
<EOS>
,
Well
,
your
honour
may
play
upon
a
poor
girl
,
that
you
know
call
answer
you
,
but
dare
not
.
  
<EOS>
Why
,
pr'ythee
now
,
insinuator
,
said
he
,
say
the
worst
you
can
before
Longman
and
Mrs.
Jervis
.
 
<EOS>
I
challenge
the
utmost
of
thy
impertinence
:
and
as
you
are
going
away
,
and
have
the
love
of
every
body
,
I
would
be
a
little
justified
to
my
family
,
that
you
have
no
reason
to
complain
of
hardships
from
me
,
as
I
have
pert
saucy
answers
from
you
,
besides
exposing
me
by
your
letters
.
  
<EOS>
Surely
,
sir
,
said
I
,
I
am
of
no
consequence
equal
to
this
,
in
your
honour
's
family
,
that
such
a
great
gentleman
as
you
,
should
need
to
justify
yourself
about
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
glad
Mrs.
Jervis
stays
with
your
honour
;
<EOS>
and
I
know
I
have
not
deserved
to
stay
:
and
,
more
than
that
,
I
do
n't
desire
to
stay
.

said
Mr.

,
and
ran
to
me
;
do
n't
say
so
,
do
n't
say
so
,
dear
Mrs.
Pamela
!
 
<EOS>
We
all
love
you
dearly
:
and
pray
down
of
your
knees
,
and
ask
his
honour
pardon
,
and
we
will
all
become
pleaders
in
a
body
,
and
I
,
and
Mrs.
Jervis
too
,
at
the
head
of
it
,
to
beg
his
honour
's
pardon
,
and
to
continue
you
,
at
least
,
till
his

marries

<EOS>
No
,
Mr.
Longman
,
said
I
,
I
can
not
ask
;
nor
will
I
stay
,
if
I
might
.
 
<EOS>
All
I
desire
is
,
to
return
to
my
poor
father
and
mother
:
<EOS>
and
though
I
love
you
all
,
I
wo
n't
stay
.
 
<EOS>
O
well
-
a
-
day
,
well
-
a
-
day
!
<EOS>
said
the
good
old
man
,
I
did
not
expect
this
!
 
<EOS>
When
I
had
got
matters
thus
far
,
and
had
made
all
up
for
Mrs.
Jervis
,
I
was
in
hopes
to
have
got
a
double
holiday
of
joy
for
all
the
family
,
in
your
pardon
too
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
said
my
master
,
this
is
a
little
specimen
of
what
I
told
you
,
Longman
.
 
<EOS>
You
see
there
's
a
spirit
you
did
not
expect
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jervis
told
me
after
,
that
she
could
stay
no
longer
,
to
hear
me
so
hardly
used
;
and
must
have
spoken
,
had
she
staid
,
what
would
never
have
been
forgiven
her
;
so
she
went
out
.
 
<EOS>
I
looked
after
her
to
go
too
;
but
my
master
said
,
Come
,
Pamela
,
give
another
specimen
,
I
desire
you
,
to
Longman
I
am
sure
you
must
,
if
you
will
but
speak
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
sir
,
said
I
,
since
it
seems
your
greatness
wants
to
be
justified
by
my
lowness
,
and
I
have
no
desire
you
should
suffer
in
the
sight
of
your
family
,
I
will
say
,
on
my
bended
knees
,
(
<EOS>
and
so
I
kneeled
down
,
)
<EOS>
that
I
have
been
a
very
faulty
,
and
a
very
ungrateful
creature
to
the
best
of
masters
<EOS>
:
I
have
been
very
perverse
and
saucy
;
and
have
deserved
nothing
at
your
hands
but
to
be
turned
out
of
your
family
with
shame
and
disgrace
.
 
<EOS>
I
,
therefore
,
have
nothing
to
say
for
myself
,
but
that
I
am
not
worthy
to
stay
,
and
so
can
not
wish
to
stay
,
and
will
not
stay
:
<EOS>
And
so
God
Almighty
bless
you
,
and
you
Mr.
Longman
,
and
good
Mrs.
Jervis
,
and
every
living
soul
of
the
family
!
<EOS>
and
I
will
pray
for
you
as
long
as
I
live
!
 
<EOS>
And
so
I
rose
up
,
and
was
forced
to
lean
upon
my
master
's
elbow
-
chair
,
or
I
should
have
sunk
down
.
  
<EOS>
The
poor
old
man
wept
more
than
I
,

My

himself

hardened

as

was

seemed
a
little
moved
,
and
took
his
handkerchief
out
of
his
pocket

walked
to

What

said
he

And
then

he

I
never

with

Get

I

Sir

said
I

I
'm
going
as
fast
as

can

<EOS>
But
,
indeed
,
my
dear
father

mother
,
my
head
was
so
giddy
,
and
my
limbs
trembled
so
,
that
I
was
forced
to
go
holding
by
the
wainscot
all
the
way
with
both
my
hands
,
and
thought
I
should
not
have
got
to

door

<EOS>
But
when
I
did
,
as
I
hoped
this
would
be
my
last
interview
with
this
terrible
hard
-
hearted
master
,
I
turned
about
,
and
made
a
low
courtesy
,
and
said
,
God
bless
you
,
sir
!
<EOS>
God
bless
you
,
Mr.
Longman
!
<EOS>
and
I
went
into
the
lobby
leading
to
the
great
hall
,
and
dropt
into
the
first
chair
;
for
I
could
get
no
farther
a
good
while
.
  
<EOS>
I
leave
all
these
things
to
your
reflection
,
my
dear
parents
<EOS>
but
I
can
write
no
more

<EOS>
My
poor

's
almost
broken

Indeed
it
is

good

in

once

and
there
the
worst
that
can
happen
will
be
joy
in

what
I
now

<EOS>
Your

<EOS>
MY
DEAR
FATHER
AND
MOTHER
,
  
I
must
write
on
,
though
I
shall
come
so
soon
;
for
now
I
have
hardly
any
thing
else
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
finished
all
that
lay
upon
me
,
and
only
wait
the
good
time
of
setting
out
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jervis
said
,
I
must
be
low
in
pocket
,
for
what
I
had
laid
out
;
and
so
would
have
presented
me
with
two
guineas
of
her
five
;
but
I
could
not
take
them
of
her
,
because
,
poor
gentlewoman
,
she
pays
old
debts
for
her
children
,
that
were
extravagant
,
and
wants
them
herself
.
 
<EOS>
This
,
though
,
was
very
good
in
her
.
  
<EOS>
I
am
sorry
I
shall
have
but
little
to
bring
with
me
;
but
I
know
you
wo
n't
,
you
are
so
good
!
 
<EOS>
and
I
will
work
the
harder
,
when
I
come
home
,
if
I
can
get
a
little
plain
-
work
,
or
any
thing
,
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
But
all
your
neighbourhood
is
so
poor
,
that
I
fear
I
shall
want
work
,
except
,
may
be
<EOS>
,
dame
Mumford
can
help
me
to
something
,
from
any
good
family
she
is
acquainted
with
.
  
<EOS>
Here
,
what
a
sad
thing
it
is
!
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
brought
up
wrong
,
as
matters
stand
.
 
<EOS>
For
,
you
know
,
my
good
lady
,
now
in
heaven
,
loved
singing
and
dancing
;
and
,
as
she
would
have
it
,
I
had
a
voice
,
she
made
me
learn
both
;
and
often
and
often
has
she
made
me
sing
her
an
innocent
song
,
and
a
good
psalm
too
,
and
dance
before
her
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
must
learn
to
flower
and
draw
too
,
and
to
work
fine
work
with
my
needle
;
why
,
all
this
too
I
have
got
pretty
tolerably
at
my
finger
's
end
,
as
they
say
;
and
she
used
to
praise
me
,
and
was
a
good
judge
of
such
matters
.
  
<EOS>
Well
now
,
what
is
all
this
to
the
purpose
,
as
things
have
turned
about
?
  
<EOS>
Why
,
no
more
nor
less
,
than
that
I
am
like
the
grasshopper
in
the
fable
,
which
I
have
read
of
in
my
lady
's
book
,
as
follows
:
 
[
See
the
Aesop
's
Fables
which
have
lately
been
selected
and
reformed
from
those
of
Sir
R.
L'Estrange
,
and
the
most
eminent
mythologists
.
]
  
<EOS>
"
As
the
ants
were
airing
their
provisions
one
winter
,
a
hungry
grasshopper
(
as
suppose
it
was
poor
<EOS>
I
)
begged
a
charity
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
They
told
him
,
That
he
should
have
wrought
in
summer
,
if
he
would
not
have
wanted
in
winter
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
says
the
grasshopper
,
but
I
was
not
idle
neither
;
for
I
sung
out
the
whole
season
.
 
<EOS>
Nay
,
then
,
said
they
,
you
'll
e'en
do
well
to
make
a
merry
year
of
it
,
and
dance
in
winter
to
the
time
you
sung
in
summer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
So
I
shall
make
a
fine
figure
with
my
singing
and
my
dancing
,
when
I
come
home
to
you
!
 
<EOS>
Nay
,
I
shall
be
unfit
even
for
a
May
-
day
holiday
-
time
;
for
these
minuets
,
rigadoons
,
and
French
dances
,
that
I
have
been
practising
,
will
make
me
but
ill
company
for
my
milk
-
maid
companions
that
are
to
be
.
<EOS>
To
be
sure
I
had
better
,
as
things
stand
,
have
learned
to
wash
and
scour
,
and
brew
and
bake
,
and
such
like
.
 
<EOS>
Put
<EOS>
I
hope
,
if
I
ca
n't
get
work
,
and
can
meet
with
a
place
,
to
learn
these
soon
,
if
any
body
will
have
the
goodness
to
bear
with
me
till
I
am
able
:
For
,
notwithstanding
what
my
master
says
,
I
hope
I
have
an
humble
and
teachable
mind
;
and
<EOS>
,
next
to
God
's
grace
,
that
's
all
my
comfort
:
for
I
shall
think
nothing
too
mean
that
is
honest
.
 
<EOS>
It
may
be
a
little
hard
at
first
;
but
woe
to
my
proud
heart
,
<EOS>
if
I
find
it
so
on
trial
;
for
I
will
make
it
bend
to
its
condition
,
or
break
it
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
read
of
a
good
bishop
that
was
to
be
burnt
for
his
religion
;
and
he
tried
how
he
could
bear
it
,
by
putting
his
fingers
into
the
lighted
candle
:
<EOS>
So
I
,
t'other
day
,
tried
,
when
Rachel
's
back
was
turned
,
if
I
could
not
scour
a
pewter
plate
she
had
begun
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
I
could
do't
by
degrees
<EOS>
:
It
only
blistered
my
hand
in
two
places
.
  
<EOS>
All
the
matter
is
,
if
I
could
get
plain
-
work
enough
,
I
need
not
spoil
my
fingers
.
 
<EOS>
But
if
I
ca
n't
,
I
hope
to
make
my
hands
as
red
as
a
blood
-
pudding
,
and
as
hard
as
a
beechen
trencher
,
to
accommodate
them
to
my
condition
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
must
break
off
;
here
's
somebody
coming
.
  
<EOS>
@@@Tis
<EOS>
only
our
Hannah
with
a
message
from
Mrs.
Jervis
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
hold
,
here
's
somebody
else
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
it
is
only
Rachel
.
  
<EOS>
I
am
as
much
frighted
,
as
were
the
city
mouse
and
the
country
mouse
,
in
the
same
book
of
fables
,
at
every
thing
that
stirs
.
 
<EOS>
O
!
<EOS>
I
have
a
power
of
these
things
to
entertain
you
with
in
winter
evenings
,
when
I
come
home
.
<EOS>
If
I
can
but
get
work
,
with
a
little
time
for
reading
,
I
hope
we
shall
be
very
happy
over
our
peat
fires
.
  
<EOS>
What
made
me
hint
to
you
,
that
I
should
bring
but
little
with
me
,
is
this
:
  
<EOS>
You
must
know
,
I
did
intend
to
do
,
as
I
have
this
afternoon
:
and
that
is
,
I
took
all
my
clothes
,
and
all
my
linen
,
and
I
divided
them
into
three
parcels
,
as
I
had
before
told
Mrs.
Jervis
I
intended
to
do
;
and
I
said
,
It
is
now
Monday
,
Mrs.
Jervis
,
and
I
am
to
go
away
on
Thursday
morning
betimes
;
<EOS>
so
,
though
I
know
you
do
n't
doubt
my
honesty
,
I
beg
you
will
look
over
my
poor
matters
,
and
let
every
one
have
what
belongs
to
them
;
for
,
said
I
,
<EOS>
you
know
I
am
resolved
to
take
with
me
only
what
I
can
properly
call
my
own
.
  
<EOS>
Said
she
,
(
I
did
not
know
her
drift
then
;
to
be
sure
she
meant
well
;
but
I
did
not
thank
her
for
it
,
when
I
did
know
it
,
)
<EOS>
Let
your
things
be
brought
down
in
the
green
-
room
,
and
I
will
do
any
thing
you
will
have
me
do
.
  
<EOS>
With
all
my
heart
,
said
I
,
green
-
room
or
any
where
;
but
I
think
you
might
step
up
,
and
see
'em
as
they
lie
.
  
<EOS>
However
,
I
fetched
'em
down
,
and
laid
them
in
three
parcels
,
as
before
;
<EOS>
and
,
when
I
had
done
,
I
went
down
to
call
her
up
to
look
at
them
.
  
<EOS>
Now
,
it
seems
,
she
had
prepared
my
master
for
this
scene
,
unknown
to
me
;
and
in
this
green
-
room
was
a
closet
,
with
a
sash
-
door
,
and
a
curtain
before
it
;
for
there
she
puts
her
sweet
-
meats
and
such
things
;
and
she
did
it
<EOS>
,
it
seems
,
to
turn
his
heart
,
as
knowing
what
I
intended
,
I
suppose
that
he
should
make
me
take
the
things
;
for
,
if
he
had
,
I
should
have
made
money
of
them
,
to
help
us
when
we
got
together
;
for
,
to
be
sure
,
I
could
never
have
appeared
in
them
.
  
<EOS>
Well
,
as
I
was
saying
,
he
had
got
,
unknown
to
me
,
into
this
closet
;
I
suppose
while
I
went
to
call
Mrs.
Jervis
:
and
she
since
owned
to
me
,
it
was
at
his
desire
,
when
she
told
him
something
of
what
I
intended
,
or
else
she
would
not
have
done
it
:
though
I
have
reason
,
I
am
sure
,
to
remember
the
last
closet
-
work
.
  
<EOS>
So
I
said
,
when
she
came
up
,
Here
,
Mrs.
Jervis
,
is
the
first
parcel
;
I
will
spread
it
all
abroad
.
 
<EOS>
These
are
the
things
my
good
lady
gave
me
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
first
place
,
said
I
 
<EOS>
and
so
I
went
on
describing
the
clothes
and
linen
<EOS>
my
lady
had
given
me
,
mingling
blessings
,
as
I
proceeded
,
for
her
goodness
to
me
;
and
when
I
had
turned
over
that
parcel
,
I
said
,
<EOS>
Well
,
so
much
for
the
first
parcel
,
Mrs.
Jervis
;
that
was
my
lady
's
gifts
.
  
<EOS>
Now
I
come
to
the
presents
of
my
dear
virtuous
master
:
<EOS>
Hey
,
you
know
closet
for
that
!
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jervis
.
 
<EOS>
She
laughed
,
and
said
,
I
never
saw
such
a
comical
girl
in
my
life
!
 
<EOS>
But
go
on
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
,
Mrs.
Jervis
,
said
I
,
as
soon
as
I
have
opened
the
bundle
;
for
I
was
as
brisk
and
as
pert
as
could
be
,
little
thinking
who
heard
me
.
  
<EOS>
Now
here
,
Mrs.
Jervis
,
said
I
,
are
my
ever
worthy
master
's
presents
;
and
then
I
particularised
all
those
in
the
second
bundle
.
  
<EOS>
After
which
,
I
turned
to
my
own
,
and
said
,
  
Now
,
Mrs.
Jervis
,
comes
poor
Pamela
's
bundle
;
and
a
little
one
it
is
to
the
others
.
 
<EOS>
First
,
here
is
a
calico
nightgown
,
that
I
used
to
wear
o
'
mornings
.
 
<EOS>
'
Twill
be
rather
too
good
for
me
when
I
get
home
;
but
I
must
have
something
.
 
<EOS>
Then
there
is
a
quilted
calamanco
coat
,
and
a
pair
of
stockings
I
bought
of
the
pedlar
,
and
my
straw
-
hat
with
blue
strings
;
and
a
remnant
of
Scots
cloth
,
which
will
make
two
shirts
and
two
shifts
,
the
same
I
have
on
,
for
my
poor
father
and
mother
.
 
<EOS>
And
here
are
four
other
shifts
,
one
the
fellow
to
that
I
have
on
;
another
pretty
good
one
,
and
the
other
two
old
fine
ones
,
that
will
serve
me
to
turn
and
wind
with
at
home
,
for
they
are
not
worth
leaving
behind
me
;
and
here
are
two
pair
of
shoes
<EOS>
,
I
have
taken
the
lace
off
,
which
I
will
burn
,
and
may
be
will
fetch
me
some
little
matter
at
a
pinch
,
with
an
old
silver
buckle
or
two
.
  
<EOS>
What
do
you
laugh
for
,
Mrs.
Jervis
?
<EOS>
said
I.
 
<EOS>
Why
you
are
like
an
April
day
;
you
cry
and
laugh
in
a
breath
.
  
<EOS>
Well
,
let
me
see
;
ay
,
here
is
a
cotton
handkerchief
I
bought
of
the
pedlar
 
there
should
be
another
somewhere
.
 
<EOS>
O
,
here
it
is
!
<EOS>
and
here
too
are
my
new
-
bought
knit
mittens
;
and
this
is
my
new
flannel
coat
,
the
fellow
to
that
I
have
on
and
in
this
parcel
,
pinned
together
,
are
several
pieces
of
printed
calico
,
remnants
of
silks
,
and
such
like
,
that
,
if
good
luck
should
happen
,
and
I
should
get
work
,
would
serve
for
robins
and
facings
,
and
such
like
uses
.
 
<EOS>
And
here
too
are
a
pair
of
pockets
:
they
are
too
fine
for
me
;
but
I
have
no
worse
.
 
<EOS>
Bless
me
,
said
I
,
<EOS>
I
did
not
think
I
had
so
many
good
things
!
  
<EOS>
Well
,
Mrs.
Jervis
,
said
I
,
you
have
seen
all
my
store
,
and
I
will
now
sit
down
,
and
tell
you
a
piece
of
my
mind
.
  
<EOS>
Be
brief
then
,
said
she
,
<EOS>
my
good
girl
:
for
she
was
afraid
,
she
said
afterwards
,
that
I
should
say
too
much
.
  
<EOS>
Why
then
the
case
is
this
:
I
am
to
enter
upon
a
point
of
equity
and
conscience
,
Mrs.
Jervis
;
and
I
must
beg
,
<EOS>
if
you
love
me
,
you
'd
let
me
have
my
own
way
.
 
<EOS>
Those
things
there
of
my
lady
's
,
I
can
have
no
claim
to
,
so
as
to
take
them
away
;
for
she
gave
them
me
,
supposing
I
was
to
wear
them
in
her
service
,
and
to
do
credit
to
her
bountiful
heart
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
since
I
am
to
be
turned
away
,
you
know
,
I
can
not
wear
them
at
my
poor
father
's
;
for
I
should
bring
all
the
little
village
upon
my
back
;
and
so
I
resolve
not
to
have
them
.
  
<EOS>
Then
,
Mrs.
Jervis
,
said
I
,
I
have
far
less
right
to
these
of
my
worthy
master
's
;
for
you
see
what
was
his
intention
in
giving
them
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
So
they
were
to
be
the
price
of
my
shame
,
and
if
I
could
make
use
of
them
,
I
should
think
I
should
never
prosper
with
them
;
and
,
besides
,
you
know
,
Mrs.
Jervis
,
if
I
would
not
do
the
good
gentleman
's
work
,
why
should
I
take
his
wages
?
 
<EOS>
So
,
in
conscience
,
in
honour
,
in
every
thing
,
I
have
nothing
to
say
to
thee
,
thou
second
wicked
bundle
!
  
<EOS>
But
,
said
I
,
cone
to
my
arms
,
my
dear
third
parcel
,
the
companion
of
my
poverty
,
and
the
witness
of
my
honesty
;
and
may
I
never
deserve
the
least
rag
that
is
contained
in
thee
,
when
I
forfeit
a
title
to
that
innocence
,
that
I
hope
will
ever
be
the
pride
of
my
life
!
<EOS>
and
then
I
am
sure
it
will
be
my
highest
comfort
at
my
death
,
when
all
the
riches
and
pomps
of
the
world
will
be
worse
than
the
vilest
rags
that
can
be
worn
by
beggars
!
<EOS>
And
so
I
hugged
my
third
bundle
.
  
<EOS>
But
,
said
I
,
Mrs.
Jervis
,
(
<EOS>
and
she
wept
to
hear
me
,
)
<EOS>
one
thing
more
<EOS>
I
have
to
trouble
you
with
,
and
that
's
all
.
  
<EOS>
There
are
four
guineas
,
you
know
,
<EOS>
that
came
out
of
my
good
lady
's
pocket
<EOS>
,
when
she
died
;
that
,
with
some
silver
,
my
master
gave
me
:
<EOS>
Now
these
same
four
guineas
I
sent
to
my
poor
father
and
mother
,
and
they
have
broken
them
;
but
would
make
them
up
,
if
I
would
:
and
if
you
think
it
should
be
so
,
it
shall
.
 
<EOS>
But
pray
tell
me
honestly
your
mind
:
<EOS>
As
to
the
three
years
before
my
lady
's
death
,
do
you
think
,
as
I
had
no
wages
,
I
may
be
supposed
to
be
quits
?
 
<EOS>
By
quits
,
I
can
not
mean
that
my
poor
services
should
be
equal
to
my
lady
's
goodness
;
for
that
's
impossible
.
 
<EOS>
But
as
all
her
learning
and
education
of
me
,
as
matters
have
turned
,
will
be
of
little
service
to
me
now
;
for
it
had
been
better
for
me
to
have
been
brought
up
to
hard
labour
,
to
be
sure
;
for
that
I
must
turn
to
at
last
,
if
I
ca
n't
get
a
place
:
(
and
you
know
,
in
places
too
,
one
is
subject
to
such
temptations
as
are
dreadful
to
think
of
:
)
<EOS>
so
,
I
say
,
by
quits
<EOS>
I
only
mean
,
as
I
return
all
the
good
things
she
gave
me
,
whether
I
may
not
set
my
little
services
against
my
keeping
;
because
,
as
I
said
,
my
learning
is
not
now
in
the
question
;
and
I
am
sure
my
dear
good
lady
would
have
thought
so
,
had
she
lived
;
but
that
too
is
now
out
of
the
question
.
 
<EOS>
Well
then
,
if
so
,
I
would
ask
,
Whether
,
in
above
this
year
that
I
have
lived
with
my
master
,
as
I
am
resolved
to
leave
all
his
gifts
behind
me
,
I
may
not
have
earned
,
besides
my
keeping
,
these
four
guineas
,
and
these
poor
clothes
here
upon
my
back
,
and
in
my
third
bundle
?
 
<EOS>
Now
tell
me
your
mind
freely
,
without
favour
or
affection
.
  
<EOS>
Alas
!
<EOS>
my
dear
girl
,
says
she
,
you
make
me
unable
to
speak
to
you
at
all
:
To
be
sure
it
will
be
the
highest
affront
that
can
be
offered
,
for
you
to
leave
any
of
these
things
behind
you
;
and
you
must
take
all
your
bundles
with
you
,
or
my
master
will
never
forgive
you
.
  
<EOS>
Well
,
well
,
Mrs.
Jervis
,
said
I
,
I
do
n't
care
;
I
have
been
too
much
used
to
be
snubbed
and
hardly
treated
by
my
master
,
of
late
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
done
him
no
harm
;
and
I
shall
always
pray
for
him
and
wish
him
happy
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
do
n't
deserve
these
things
;
I
know
I
do
n't
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
I
ca
n't
wear
them
,
if
I
should
take
them
;
so
they
can
be
of
no
use
to
me
:
<EOS>
And
I
trust
I
shall
not
want
the
poor
pittance
<EOS>
,
that
is
all
I
desire
to
keep
life
and
soul
together
.
 
<EOS>
Bread
and
water
I
can
live
upon
,
Mrs.
Jervis
,
with
content
.
<EOS>
Water
I
shall
get
any
where
;
and
if
I
ca
n't
get
me
bread
,
I
will
live
like
a
bird
in
winter
upon
hips
and
haws
,
and
at
other
times
upon
pig
-
nuts
and
potatoes
,
or
turnips
,
or
any
thing
.
 
<EOS>
So
what
occasion
have
I
for
these
things
?
 
<EOS>
But
all
I
ask
is
about
these
four
guineas
,
and
if
you
think
I
need
not
return
them
,
that
is
all
I
want
to
know
.
 
<EOS>
To
be
sure
,
my
dear
,
you
need
not
,
said
she
;
you
have
well
earned
them
by
that
waistcoat
only
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
I
think
not
so
,
in
that
only
;
but
in
the
linen
,
and
other
things
,
do
you
think
I
have
?
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
yes
,
said
she
,
and
more
.
 
<EOS>
And
my
keeping
allowed
for
<EOS>
,
I
mean
,
said
I
,
and
these
poor
clothes
on
my
back
,
besides
?
 
<EOS>
Remember
that
,
Mrs.
Jervis
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
my
dear
odd
-
one
,
no
doubt
you
have
.
 
<EOS>
Well
then
,
said
I
,
I
am
as
happy
as
a
princess
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
quite
as
rich
as
I
wish
to
be
:
and
once
more
,
my
dear
third
bundle
,
I
will
hug
thee
to
my
bosom
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
beg
you
'll
say
nothing
of
all
this
till
I
am
gone
,
that
my
master
may
n't
be
so
angry
,
but
that
I
may
go
in
peace
;
for
my
heart
,
without
other
matters
,
will
he
ready
to
break
to
part
with
you
all
.
  
<EOS>
Now
,
Mrs.
Jervis
,
said
I
,
as
to
one
matter
more
:
and
that
is
my
master
's
last
usage
of
me
,
before
Mr.
Longman
.
 
<EOS>
Said
she
,
Pr'ythee
,
dear
Pamela
,
step
to
my
chamber
,
and
fetch
me
a
paper
I
left
on
my
table
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
something
to
shew
you
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
,
said
I
,
and
stepped
down
;
but
that
was
only
a
fetch
,
to
take
the
orders
of
my
master
,
I
found
.
 
<EOS>
It
seems
he
said
,
he
thought
two
or
three
times
to
have
burst
out
upon
me
;
but
he
could
not
stand
it
,
and
wished
I
might
not
know
he
was
there
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
tripped
up
again
so
nimbly
,
(
for
there
was
no
paper
,
)
<EOS>
that
I
just
saw
his
back
,
as
if
coming
out
of
that
green
-
room
,
and
going
into
the
next
to
it
,
the
first
door
that
was
open
 
<EOS>
I
whipped
in
,
and
shut
the
door
,
and
bolted
it
.
 
<EOS>
O
Mrs.
Jervis
!
<EOS>
said
I
,
what
have
you
done
by
me
?
 
<EOS>
I
see
I
ca
n't
confide
in
any
body
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
beset
on
all
hands
.
 
<EOS>
Wretched
,
wretched
Pamela
,
where
shalt
thou
expect
a
friend
,
if
Mrs.
Jervis
joins
to
betray
thee
thus
?
 
<EOS>
She
made
so
many
protestations
,
(
telling
me
all
,
and
that
he
owned
I
had
made
him
wipe
his
eyes
two
or
three
times
,
and
said
she
hoped
it
would
have
a
good
effect
,
and
remembered
me
,
that
I
had
said
nothing
but
what
would
rather
move
compassion
than
resentment
,
)
that
I
forgave
her
.
 
<EOS>
But
O
!
<EOS>
that
I
was
safe
from
this
house
!
<EOS>
for
never
poor
creature
sure
was
so
flustered
as
I
have
been
so
many
months
together
;
 
I
am
called
down
from
this
most
tedious
scribble
.
 
<EOS>
I
wonder
what
will
next
befall
                          
<EOS>
Your
dutiful
DAUGHTER
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jervis
says
,
she
is
sure
I
shall
have
the
chariot
to
carry
me
home
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
Though
this
will
look
too
great
for
me
,
yet
it
will
shew
as
if
I
was
not
turned
away
quite
in
disgrace
.
 
<EOS>
The
travelling
chariot
is
come
from
Lincolnshire
,
and
I
fancy
<EOS>
I
shall
go
in
that
;
for
the
other
is
quite
grand
.
    
<EOS>
MY
DEAR
FATHER
AND
MOTHER
,
  
<EOS>
I
write
again
,
though
,
may
be
,
I
shall
bring
it
to
you
in
my
pocket
:
<EOS>
for
I
shall
have
no
writing
,
nor
writing
-
time
,
I
hope
,
when
I
come
to
you
.
<EOS>
This
is
Wednesday
morning
,
and
I
shall
,
I
hope
,
set
out
to
you
to
-
morrow
morning
;
but
I
have
had
more
trials
and
more
vexations
;
but
of
another
complexion
too
a
little
,
though
all
from
the
same
quarter
.
  
<EOS>
Yesterday
my
master
,
after
he
came
from
hunting
,
sent
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
went
with
great
terror
:
<EOS>
for
I
expected
he
would
storm
,
and
be
in
a
fine
passion
with
me
for
my
freedom
of
speech
before
:
<EOS>
so
I
was
resolved
to
begin
first
,
with
submission
,
to
disarm
his
anger
;
and
I
fell
upon
my
knees
as
soon
as
I
saw
him
;
and
said
,
Good
sir
,
let
me
beseech
you
,
as
you
hope
to
be
forgiven
yourself
,
and
for
the
sake
of
my
dear
good
lady
your
mother
,
who
recommended
me
to
you
with
her
last
words
,
to
forgive
me
all
my
faults
;
and
only
grant
me
this
favour
,
the
last
I
shall
ask
you
,
that
you
will
let
me
depart
your
house
with
peace
and
quietness
of
mind
,
that
I
may
take
such
a
leave
of
my
dear
fellow
-
servants
as
befits
me
;
and
that
my
heart
be
not
quite
broken
.
  
<EOS>
He
took
me
up
,
in
a
kinder
manner
than
ever
I
had
known
;
and
he
said
,
Shut
the
door
,
Pamela
,
and
come
to
me
in
my
closet
:
I
want
to
have
a
little
serious
talk
with
you
.
 
<EOS>
How
can
I
,
sir
,
said
I
,
how
can
I
!
<EOS>
and
wrung
my
hands
.
 
<EOS>
O
pray
,
sir
,
let
me
go
out
of
your
presence
,
I
beseech
you
!
 
<EOS>
By
the
God
that
made
me
,
said
he
,
I
'll
do
you
no
harm
.
 
<EOS>
Shut
the
parlour
door
,
and
come
to
me
in
my
library
.
  
<EOS>
He
then
went
into
his
closet
,
which
is
his
library
,
and
full
of
rich
pictures
besides
;
a
noble
apartment
,
though
called
a
closet
,
and
next
the
private
garden
,
into
which
it
has
a
door
that
opens
.
 
<EOS>
I
shut
the
parlour
door
,
as
he
bid
me
;
but
stood
at
it
irresolute
.
 
<EOS>
Place
some
confidence
in
me
<EOS>
,
said
he
:
<EOS>
Surely
you
may
,
when
I
have
spoken
thus
solemnly
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
crept
towards
him
with
trembling
feet
,
and
my
heart
throbbing
through
my
handkerchief
.
 
<EOS>
Come
in
,
said
he
,
when
I
bid
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
did
so
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
,
sir
,
said
I
,
pity
and
spare
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
,
said
he
,
as
I
hope
to
be
saved
.
 
<EOS>
He
sat
down
upon
a
rich
settee
;
and
took
hold
of
my
hand
,
and
said
,
Do
n't
doubt
me
,
Pamela
.
 
<EOS>
From
this
moment
I
will
no
more
consider
you
as
my
servant
:
and
I
desire
you
'll
not
use
me
with
ingratitude
for
the
kindness
I
am
going
to
express
towards
you
.
 
<EOS>
This
a
little
emboldened
me
;
and
<EOS>
he
said
,
holding
both
my
hands
between
his
,
You
have
too
much
wit
and
good
sense
not
to
discover
,
that
I
,
in
spite
of
my
heart
,
and
all
the
pride
of
it
,
can
not
but
love
you
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
look
up
to
me
,
my
sweet
-
faced
girl
!
 
<EOS>
I
must
say
I
love
you
;
and
have
put
on
a
behaviour
to
you
,
that
was
much
against
my
heart
,
in
hopes
to
frighten
you
from
your
reservedness
.
 
<EOS>
You
see
I
own
it
ingenuously
;
and
do
n't
play
your
sex
upon
me
for
it
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
unable
to
speak
;
and
he
,
seeing
me
too
much
oppressed
with
confusion
to
go
on
in
that
strain
,
said
,
Well
,
Pamela
,
let
me
know
in
what
situation
of
life
is
your
father
:
<EOS>
I
know
he
is
a
poor
man
;
but
is
he
as
low
and
as
honest
as
he
was
when
my
mother
took
you
?
  
<EOS>
Then
I
could
speak
a
little
;
and
with
a
down
look
,
(
and
I
felt
my
face
glow
like
fire
,
)
<EOS>
I
said
,
Yes
,
<EOS>
sir
,
as
poor
and
as
honest
too
;
and
that
is
my
pride
.
 
<EOS>
Says
he
,
I
will
do
something
for
him
,
if
it
be
not
your
fault
,
and
make
all
your
family
happy
.
 
<EOS>
All
,
sir
,
said
I
,
he
is
happier
already
than
ever
he
can
be
,
if
his
daughter
's
innocence
is
to
be
the
price
of
your
favour
:
<EOS>
and
I
beg
<EOS>
you
will
not
speak
to
me
on
the
only
side
that
can
wound
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
design
of
that
sort
,
said
he
.
 
<EOS>
O
sir
,
said
I
,
tell
me
not
so
,
tell
me
not
so
!
 
<EOS>
"
Tis
easy
,
said
he
,
for
me
to
be
the
making
of
your
father
,
without
injuring
you
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
sir
,
said
I
,
if
this
can
be
done
,
let
me
know
how
;
and
all
I
can
do
with
innocence
shall
be
the
study
and
practice
of
my
life
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
O
!
<EOS>
what
can
such
a
poor
creature
as
I
do
,
and
do
my
duty
?
 
<EOS>
Said
he
<EOS>
,
I
would
have
you
stay
a
week
or
fortnight
only
,
and
behave
yourself
with
kindness
to
me
;
I
stoop
to
beg
it
of
you
,
and
you
shall
see
all
shall
turn
out
beyond
your
expectation
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
,
said
he
,
you
are
going
to
answer
otherwise
than
I
would
have
you
;
and
I
begin
to
be
vexed
<EOS>
I
should
thus
meanly
sue
;
<EOS>
and
so
I
will
say
,
that
your
behaviour
before
honest
Longman
,
when
I
used
you
as
I
did
,
and
you
could
so
well
have
vindicated
yourself
,
has
quite
charmed
me
.
 
<EOS>
And
though
I
am
not
pleased
with
all
you
said
yesterday
,
while
I
was
in
the
closet
,
yet
you
have
moved
me
more
to
admire
you
than
before
;
and
I
am
awakened
to
see
more
worthiness
in
you
,
than
ever
I
saw
in
any
lady
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
All
the
servants
,
from
the
highest
to
the
lowest
,
doat
upon
you
,
instead
of
envying
you
;
and
look
upon
you
in
so
superior
a
light
,
as
speaks
what
you
ought
to
be
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
seen
more
of
your
letters
than
you
imagine
,
(
This
surprised
me
!
)
and
am
quite
overcome
with
your
charming
manner
of
writing
,
so
free
,
so
easy
,
and
many
of
your
sentiments
so
much
above
your
years
,
and
your
sex
;
and
all
put
together
,
makes
me
,
as
I
tell
you
,
love
you
to
extravagance
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
Pamela
,
when
I
have
stooped
to
acknowledge
all
this
,
oblige
me
only
to
stay
another
week
or
fortnight
,
to
give
me
time
to
bring
about
some
certain
affairs
,
and
you
shall
see
how
much
you
may
find
your
account
in
it
.
  
<EOS>
I
trembled
to
find
my
poor
heart
giving
way
.
 
<EOS>
O
good
sir
,
said
I
,
spare
a
poor
girl
that
can
not
look
up
to
you
,
and
speak
.
 
<EOS>
My
heart
is
full
;
and
why
should
you
wish
to
undo
me
?
 
<EOS>
Only
oblige
me
,
said
he
,
to
stay
a
fortnight
longer
,
and
John
shall
carry
word
to
your
father
,
that
I
will
see
him
in
the
time
,
either
here
,
or
at
the
Swan
in
his
village
.
 
<EOS>
O
sir
,
said
I
,
my
heart
will
burst
;
but
,
on
my
bended
knees
,
I
beg
you
to
let
me
go
to
-
morrow
,
as
I
designed
:
and
do
n't
offer
to
tempt
a
poor
creature
,
whose
whole
will
would
be
to
do
yours
,
if
my
virtue
would
permit
!
 
<EOS>
I
shall
permit
it
,
said
he
;
for
I
intend
no
injury
to
you
,
God
is
my
witness
!
 
<EOS>
Impossible
!
<EOS>
said
I
;
<EOS>
I
can
not
,
sir
,
believe
you
,
after
what
has
passed
:
How
many
ways
are
there
to
undo
poor
creatures
!
 
<EOS>
Good
God
,
protect
me
this
one
time
,
and
send
me
but
to
my
dear
father
's
cot
in
safety
!
 
<EOS>
Strange
,
d####d
fate
!
<EOS>
said
he
,
that
when
I
speak
so
solemnly
,
I
ca
n't
be
believed
!
 
<EOS>
What
should
I
believe
,
sir
?
<EOS>
said
I
,
what
can
I
believe
?
 
<EOS>
What
have
you
said
,
but
that
I
am
to
stay
a
fortnight
longer
?
<EOS>
and
what
then
is
to
become
of
me
?
 
<EOS>
My
pride
of
birth
and
fortune
<EOS>
(
d####n
them
both
!
<EOS>
said
he
,
since
they
can
not
obtain
credit
with
you
,
but
must
add
to
your
suspicions
)
<EOS>
will
not
let
me
descend
all
at
once
;
and
I
ask
you
but
a
fortnight
's
stay
,
that
,
after
this
declaration
,
I
may
pacify
those
proud
demands
upon
me
.
  
<EOS>
O
how
my
heart
throbbed
!
<EOS>
and
I
began
(
for
I
did
not
know
what
I
did
)
to
say
the
Lord
's
prayer
.
 
<EOS>
None
of
your
beads
to
me
Pamela
!
<EOS>
said
he
;
thou
art
a
perfect
nun
<EOS>
,
I
think
.
  
<EOS>
But
I
said
aloud
,
with
my
eyes
lifted
up
to
heaven
,
Lead
me
not
into
temptation
:
but
deliver
me
from
evil
,
O
my
good
God
!
 
<EOS>
He
hugged
me
in
his
arms
,
and
said
,
Well
,
my
dear
girl
,
then
you
stay
this
fortnight
,
and
you
shall
see
what
I
will
do
for
you
 
<EOS>
I
'll
leave
you
a
moment
,
and
walk
into
the
next
room
,
to
give
you
time
to
think
of
it
,
and
to
shew
you
I
have
no
design
upon
you
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
this
,
I
thought
,
did
not
look
amiss
.
  
<EOS>
He
went
out
,
and
I
was
tortured
with
twenty
different
doubts
in
a
minute
;
sometimes
I
thought
that
to
stay
a
week
or
fortnight
longer
in
this
house
to
obey
him
,
while
Mrs.
Jervis
was
with
me
,
could
do
no
great
harm
:
<EOS>
But
then
,
thought
I
,
how
do
I
know
what
I
may
be
able
to
do
?
 
<EOS>
I
have
withstood
his
anger
;
but
may
I
not
relent
at
his
kindness
?
 
<EOS>
How
shall
I
stand
that
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
I
hope
,
thought
<EOS>
I
,
by
the
same
protecting
grace
in
which
I
will
always
confide
!
 
<EOS>
But
,
then
,
what
has
he
promised
?
 
<EOS>
Why
,
he
will
make
my
poor
father
and
mother
's
life
comfortable
.
 
<EOS>
O
!
said
I
to
myself
,
that
is
a
rich
thought
;
but
let
me
not
dwell
upon
it
,
for
fear
I
should
indulge
it
to
my
ruin
.
 
<EOS>
What
can
he
do
for
me
,
poor
girl
as
I
am
!
  
<EOS>
W
hat
can
his
greatness
stoop
to
!
 
<EOS>
He
talks
,
thought
I
,
of
his
pride
of
heart
,
and
pride
of
condition
;
O
these
are
in
his
head
,
and
in
his
heart
too
,
or
he
would
not
confess
them
to
me
at
such
an
instant
.
 
<EOS>
Well
then
,
thought
I
,
this
can
be
only
to
seduce
me
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
promised
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
am
to
see
what
he
will
do
,
if
I
stay
a
fortnight
;
and
this
fortnight
,
thought
I
again
,
is
no
such
great
matter
;
and
I
shall
see
in
a
few
days
how
he
carries
it
.
 
<EOS>
But
then
,
when
I
again
reflected
upon
this
distance
between
him
and
me
,
and
his
now
open
declaration
of
love
,
as
he
called
it
;
and
that
after
this
he
would
talk
with
me
on
that
subject
more
plainly
than
ever
,
and
I
shall
be
less
armed
,
may
be
,
to
withstand
him
;
and
then
I
bethought
myself
,
why
,
if
he
meant
no
dishonour
,
he
should
not
speak
before
Mrs.
Jervis
;
and
the
odious
frightful
closet
came
again
into
my
head
,
and
my
narrow
escape
upon
it
;
and
how
easy
it
might
be
for
him
to
send
Mrs.
Jervis
and
the
maids
out
of
the
way
;
and
so
that
all
the
mischief
he
designed
me
might
be
brought
about
in
less
than
that
time
;
I
resolved
to
go
away
and
trust
all
to
Providence
,
and
nothing
to
myself
.
<EOS>
And
how
ought
I
to
be
thankful
for
this
resolution
!
 
<EOS>
as
you
shall
hear
.
  
<EOS>
But
just
as
I
have
writ
to
this
place
<EOS>
,
John
sends
me
word
,
that
he
is
going
this
minute
your
way
;
and
so
I
will
send
you
so
far
as
I
have
written
,
and
hope
by
to
-
morrow
night
,
to
ask
your
blessings
,
at
your
own
poor
,
but
happy
abode
,
and
tell
you
the
rest
by
word
of
mouth
;
and
so
I
rest
,
till
then
,
and
for
ever
,
              
<EOS>
Your
dutiful
DAUGHTER
.
    
<EOS>
DEAR
FATHER
AND
MOTHER
,
  
I
will
continue
my
writing
still
,
because
,
may
be
,
I
shall
like
to
read
it
,
when
I
am
with
you
,
to
see
what
dangers
I
have
been
enabled
to
escape
;
and
though
I
bring
it
along
with
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
told
you
my
resolution
,
my
happy
resolution
as
I
have
reason
to
think
it
:
<EOS>
and
just
then
he
came
in
again
,
with
great
kindness
in
his
looks
,
and
said
,
I
make
no
doubt
,
Pamela
,
you
will
stay
this
fortnight
to
oblige
me
.
<EOS>
I
knew
not
how
to
frame
my
words
so
as
to
deny
,
and
yet
not
make
him
storm
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
said
I
,
Forgive
,
sir
,
your
poor
distressed
servant
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
<EOS>
I
can
not
possibly
deserve
any
favour
at
your
hands
,
consistent
with
virtue
;
and
I
beg
you
will
let
me
go
to
my
poor
father
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
said
he
,
thou
art
the
veriest
fool
that
I
ever
knew
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
you
I
will
see
your
father
;
I
'll
send
for
him
hither
to
-
morrow
,
in
my
travelling
chariot
,
if
you
will
;
and
I
'll
let
him
know
what
I
intend
to
do
for
him
and
you
.
<EOS>
What
,
sir
,
may
I
ask
you
,
can
that
be
?
 
<EOS>
Your
honour
's
noble
estate
may
easily
make
him
happy
,
and
not
unuseful
,
perhaps
to
you
,
in
some
respect
or
other
.
 
<EOS>
But
what
price
am
I
to
pay
for
all
this
?
 
<EOS>
Yon
shall
be
happy
as
you
can
wish
,
said
he
,
I
do
assure
you
:
<EOS>
And
here
I
will
now
give
you
this
purse
,
in
which
are
fifty
guineas
,
which
I
will
allow
your
father
yearly
,
and
find
an
employ
suitable
to
his
liking
,
to
deserve
that
and
more
:
Pamela
,
he
shall
never
want
,
depend
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
have
given
you
still
more
for
him
,
but
that
,
perhaps
,
you
'd
suspect
I
intended
it
as
a
design
upon
you
.
 
<EOS>
O
sir
,
said
I
,
take
back
your
guineas
!
 
<EOS>
I
will
not
touch
one
,
nor
will
my
father
,
I
am
sure
,
till
he
knows
what
is
to
be
done
for
them
;
and
particularly
what
is
to
become
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
Why
then
,
Pamela
,
said
he
,
suppose
I
find
a
man
of
probity
,
and
genteel
calling
,
for
a
husband
for
you
,
that
shall
make
you
a
gentlewoman
as
long
as
you
live
?
 
<EOS>
I
want
no
husband
,
sir
,
said
I
:
for
now
I
began
to
see
him
in
all
his
black
colours
!
 
<EOS>
Yet
being
so
much
in
his
power
,
I
thought
I
would
a
little
dissemble
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
said
he
,
you
are
so
pretty
,
<EOS>
that
go
where
you
will
<EOS>
,
you
can
never
be
free
from
the
designs
of
some
or
other
of
our
sex
;
and
I
shall
think
I
do
n't
answer
the
care
of
my
dying
mother
for
you
,
who
committed
you
to
me
,
if
I
do
n't
provide
you
a
husband
to
protect
your
virtue
,
and
your
innocence
;
and
a
worthy
one
I
have
thought
of
for
you
.
  
<EOS>
O
black
,
perfidious
creature
!
<EOS>
thought
I
,
what
an
implement
art
thou
in
the
hands
of
Lucifer
,
to
ruin
the
innocent
heart
!
 
<EOS>
Yet
still
I
dissembled
:
<EOS>
for
I
feared
much
both
him
and
the
place
I
was
in
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
whom
,
pray
sir
,
have
you
thought
of
?
 
<EOS>
Why
,
said
he
,
young
Mr.
Williams
,
my
chaplain
,
in
Lincolnshire
,
who
will
make
you
happy
.
 
<EOS>
Does
he
know
,
sir
,
said
I
,
any
thing
of
your
honour
's
intentions
?
 
<EOS>
No
,
my
girl
,
said
he
,
and
kissed
me
,
(
much
against
my
will
;
for
his
very
breath
was
now
poison
to
me
,
)
but
his
dependance
upon
my
favour
,
and
your
beauty
and
merit
,
will
make
him
rejoice
at
my
kindness
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
sir
,
said
I
,
then
it
is
time
enough
to
consider
of
this
matter
;
and
it
can
not
hinder
me
from
going
to
my
father
's
:
for
what
will
staying
a
fortnight
longer
signify
to
this
?
 
<EOS>
Your
honour
's
care
and
goodness
may
extend
to
me
there
,
as
well
as
here
;
and
Mr.
Williams
,
and
all
the
world
,
shall
know
that
I
am
not
ashamed
of
my
father
's
poverty
.
  
<EOS>
He
would
kiss
me
again
,
and
I
said
,
If
I
am
to
think
of
Mr.
Williams
,
or
any
body
,
I
beg
you
'll
not
be
so
free
with
me
:
<EOS>
that
is
not
pretty
,
I
'm
sure
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
said
he
,
but
you
stay
this
next
fortnight
,
and
in
that
time
I
'll
have
both
Williams
and
your
father
here
;
for
I
will
have
the
match
concluded
in
my
house
;
and
when
I
have
brought
it
on
,
you
shall
settle
it
as
you
please
together
.
 
<EOS>
Meantime
take
and
send
only
these
fifty
pieces
to
your
father
,
as
an
earnest
of
my
favour
,
and
I
'll
make
you
all
happy
.
  
<EOS>
S
ir
,
said
I
,
I
beg
at
least
two
hours
to
consider
of
this
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
,
said
he
,
be
gone
out
in
one
hour
;
and
I
would
have
you
write
to
your
father
what
I
propose
;
and
John
shall
carry
it
on
purpose
:
and
he
shall
take
the
purse
with
him
for
the
good
old
man
,
if
you
approve
it
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
said
I
,
I
will
then
let
you
know
in
one
hour
my
resolution
.
 
<EOS>
Do
so
,
said
he
;
and
gave
me
another
kiss
,
and
let
nee
go
.
  
<EOS>
O
how
I
rejoiced
I
had
got
out
of
his
clutches
!
 
<EOS>
So
I
write
you
this
,
that
you
may
see
how
matters
stand
;
for
I
am
resolved
to
come
away
,
if
possible
.
 
<EOS>
Base
,
wicked
,
treacherous
gentleman
as
he
is
!
  
<EOS>
So
here
was
a
trap
laid
for
your
poor
Pamela
!
 
<EOS>
I
tremble
to
think
of
it
!
<EOS>
O
what
a
scene
of
wickedness
was
here
laid
down
for
all
my
wretched
life
!
<EOS>
Black
-
hearted
wretch
!
<EOS>
how
I
hate
him
!
 
<EOS>
For
,
at
first
,
as
you
'll
see
by
what
I
have
written
,
he
would
have
made
me
believe
other
things
;
and
this
of
Mr.
Williams
,
I
suppose
,
came
into
his
head
after
he
walked
out
from
his
closet
,
to
give
himself
time
to
think
how
to
delude
me
better
:
but
the
covering
was
now
too
thin
,
and
easy
to
be
seen
through
.
  
<EOS>
I
went
to
my
chamber
,
and
the
first
thing
I
did
was
to
write
to
him
;
for
I
thought
it
was
best
not
to
see
him
again
,
if
I
could
help
it
;
and
I
put
it
under
his
parlour
door
,
after
I
had
copied
it
,
as
follows
:
  
"
HONOURED
SIR
,
  
"
Your
last
proposal
to
me
convinces
me
,
that
I
ought
not
to
stay
,
but
to
go
to
my
father
,
if
it
were
but
to
ask
his
advice
about
Mr.
Williams
.
<EOS>
And
I
am
so
set
upon
it
,
that
I
am
not
to
be
persuaded
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
honoured
sir
,
with
a
thousand
thanks
for
all
favours
,
I
will
set
out
to
-
morrow
early
;
and
the
honour
you
designed
me
,
as
Mrs.
Jervis
tells
me
,
of
your
chariot
,
there
will
be
no
occasion
for
:
because
I
can
hire
,
I
believe
,
farmer
Brady
's
chaise
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
begging
you
will
not
take
it
amiss
<EOS>
,
I
shall
ever
be
                        
"
Your
dutiful
Servant
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
As
to
the
purse
,
sir
,
my
poor
father
,
to
be
sure
,
wo
n't
forgive
me
,
if
I
take
it
,
till
he
can
know
how
to
deserve
it
which
is
impossible
.
"
  
<EOS>
So
he
has
just
now
sent
Mrs.
Jervis
to
tell
me
,
that
since
I
am
resolved
to
go
,
go
I
may
,
and
the
travelling
chariot
shall
be
ready
;
but
it
shall
be
worse
for
me
;
for
that
he
will
never
trouble
himself
about
me
as
long
as
he
lives
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
so
I
get
out
of
the
house
<EOS>
,
I
care
not
;
only
I
should
have
been
glad
I
could
,
with
innocence
,
have
made
you
,
my
dear
parents
,
happy
.
  
<EOS>
I
can
not
imagine
the
reason
of
it
,
but
John
,
who
I
thought
was
gone
with
my
last
,
is
but
now
going
;
and
he
sends
to
know
if
I
have
any
thing
else
to
carry
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
break
off
to
send
you
this
with
the
former
.
  
<EOS>
I
am
now
preparing
for
my
journey
,
and
about
taking
leave
of
my
good
fellow
-
servants
:
and
if
I
have
not
time
to
write
,
I
must
tell
you
the
rest
,
when
I
am
so
happy
as
to
be
with
you
.
  
<EOS>
One
word
more
:
I
slip
in
a
paper
of
verses
,
on
my
going
:
sad
poor
stuff
!
<EOS>
but
as
they
come
from
me
,
you
'll
not
dislike
them
,
may
be
.
 
<EOS>
I
shewed
them
to
Mrs.
Jervis
,
and
she
liked
them
,
and
took
a
copy
;
and
made
one
sing
them
to
her
,
and
in
the
green
-
room
too
;
but
I
looked
into
the
closet
first
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
only
add
,
that
I
am
             
Your
dutiful
DAUGHTER
.
  
<EOS>
Let
me
just
say
,
That
he
has
this
moment
sent
me
five
guineas
by
Mrs.
Jervis
,
as
a
present
for
my
pocket
:
<EOS>
So
I
shall
be
very
rich
;
for
as
she
brought
them
,
I
thought
I
might
take
them
.
 
<EOS>
He
says
he
wo
n't
see
me
:
<EOS>
and
I
may
go
when
I
will
in
the
morning
;
and
Lincolnshire
Robin
shall
drive
me
:
but
he
is
so
angry
<EOS>
,
he
orders
that
nobody
shall
go
out
at
the
door
with
me
,
not
so
much
as
into
the
coach
-
yard
.
 
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
help
it
,
not
I
!
 
<EOS>
But
does
not
this
expose
himself
more
than
me
?
  
<EOS>
But
John
waits
,
and
I
would
have
brought
this
and
the
other
myself
;
but
he
says
,
he
has
put
it
up
among
other
things
,
and
so
can
take
both
as
well
as
one
.
  
<EOS>
John
is
very
good
,
and
very
honest
;
I
am
under
great
obligations
to
him
.
<EOS>
I
'd
give
him
a
guinea
,
now
I
'm
so
rich
,
if
I
thought
he
'd
take
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
hear
nothing
of
my
lady
's
clothes
,
and
those
my
master
gave
me
:
for
I
told
Mrs.
Jervis
<EOS>
,
I
would
not
take
them
;
but
I
fancy
,
by
a
word
or
two
that
was
dropped
,
they
will
be
sent
after
me
.
 
<EOS>
Dear
sirs
!
<EOS>
what
a
rich
Pamela
you
'll
have
if
they
should
!
 
<EOS>
But
as
I
ca
n't
wear
them
if
they
do
,
I
do
n't
desire
them
;
and
if
I
have
them
,
will
turn
them
into
money
,
as
I
can
have
opportunity
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
no
more
 
I
'm
in
a
fearful
hurry
!

With

For

PAMELA
,
  
Here
it
is
necessary
the
reader
should
know
,
that
the
fair
Pamela
's
trials
were
not
yet
over
;
but
the
worst
were
to
come
,
at
a
time
when
she
thought
them
at
an
end
,
and
that
she
was
returning
to
her
father
:
for
when
her
master
found
her
virtue
was
not
to
be
subdued
,
and
he
had
in
vain
tried
to
conquer
his
passion
for
her
,
being
a
gentleman
of
pleasure
and
intrigue
,
he
had
ordered
his
Lincolnshire
coachman
to
bring
his
travelling
chariot
from
thence
,
not
caring
to
trust
his
Bedfordshire
coachman
,
who
,
with
the
rest
of
the
servants
,
so
greatly
loved
and
honoured
the
fair
damsel
;
and
having
given
him
instructions
accordingly
,
and
prohibited
the
other
servants
,
on
pretence
of
resenting
Pamela
's
behaviour
,
from
accompanying
her
any
part
of
the
road
,
he
drove
her
five
miles
on
the
way
to
her
father
's
;
and
then
turning
off
,
crossed
the
country
,
and
carried
her
onwards
toward
his
Lincolnshire
estate
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
also
to
be
observed
,
that
the
messenger
of
her
letters
to
her
father
,
who
so
often
pretended
business
that
way
,
was
an
implement
in
his
master
's
hands
,
and
employed
by
him
for
that
purpose
;
and
always
gave
her
letters
first
to
him
,
and
his
master
used
to
open
and
read
them
,
and
then
send
them
on
;
by
which
means
,
as
he
hints
to
her
,
(
as
she
observes
in
her
letter
XXX
)
<EOS>
he
was
no
stranger
to
what
she
wrote
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
every
way
was
the
poor
virgin
beset
:
<EOS>
And
the
whole
will
shew
the
base
arts
of
designing
men
to
gain
their
wicked
ends
;
and
how
much
it
behoves
the
fair
sex
to
stand
upon
their
guard
against
artful
contrivances
,
especially
when
riches
and
power
conspire
against
innocence
and
a
low
estate
.
  
<EOS>
A
few
words
more
will
be
necessary
to
make
the
sequel
better
understood
.
<EOS>
The
intriguing
gentleman
thought
fit
,
however
,
to
keep
back
from
her
father
her
three
last
letters
;
in
which
she
mentions
his
concealing
himself
to
hear
her
partitioning
out
her
clothes
,
his
last
effort
to
induce
her
to
stay
a
fortnight
,
his
pretended
proposal
of
the
chaplain
,
and
her
hopes
of
speedily
seeing
them
,
as
also
her
verses
;
and
to
send
himself
a
letter
to
her
father
,
which
is
as
follows
:
  
"
GOODMAN
ANDREWS
,
  
"
You
will
wonder
to
receive
a
letter
from
me
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
think
I
am
obliged
to
let
you
know
,
that
I
have
discovered
the
strange
correspondence
carried
on
between
you
and
your
daughter
,
so
injurious
to
my
honour
and
reputation
,
and
which
,
I
think
,
you
should
not
have
encouraged
,
till
you
knew
there
were
sufficient
grounds
for
those
aspersions
,
which
she
so
plentifully
casts
upon
me
.
 
<EOS>
Something
possibly
there
might
be
in
what
she
has
written
from
time
to
time
;
but
,
believe
me
,
with
all
her
pretended
simplicity
and
innocence
,
I
never
knew
so
much
romantic
invention
as
she
is
mistress
of
.
 
<EOS>
In
short
,
the
girl
's
head
's
turned
by
romances
,
and
such
idle
stuff
,
to
which
she
has
given
herself
up
,
ever
since
her
kind
lady
's
death
.
 
<EOS>
And
she
assumes
airs
,
as
if
she
was
a
mirror
of
perfection
,
and
every
body
had
a
design
upon
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
mistake
me
,
however
;
I
believe
her
very
honest
,
and
very
virtuous
;
but
I
have
found
out
also
,
that
she
is
carrying
on
a
sort
of
correspondence
,
or
love
affair
,
with
a
young
clergyman
,
that
I
hope
in
time
to
provide
for
;
but
who
,
at
present
,
is
destitute
of
any
subsistence
but
my
favour
:
<EOS>
And
what
would
be
the
consequence
,
can
you
think
,
of
two
young
folks
,
who
have
nothing
in
the
world
to
trust
to
of
their
own
to
come
together
with
a
family
multiplying
upon
them
before
they
have
bread
to
eat
.
  
<EOS>
"
For
my
part
,
I
have
too
much
kindness
to
them
both
,
not
to
endeavour
to
prevent
it
,
if
I
can
;
and
for
this
reason
I
have
sent
her
out
of
his
way
for
a
little
while
,
till
I
can
bring
them
both
to
better
consideration
;
and
I
would
not
,
therefore
,
have
you
be
surprised
you
do
n't
see
your
daughter
so
soon
as
you
might
possibly
expect
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yet
I
do
assure
you
,
upon
my
honour
,
that
she
shall
be
safe
and
inviolate
;
and
I
hope
you
do
n't
doubt
me
,
notwithstanding
any
airs
she
may
have
given
herself
,
upon
my
jocular
pleasantry
to
her
,
and
perhaps
a
little
innocent
romping
with
her
,
so
usual
with
young
folks
of
the
two
sexes
,
when
they
have
been
long
acquainted
,
and
grown
up
together
;
for
pride
is
not
my
talent
.
  
<EOS>
"
As
she
is
a
mighty
letter
-
writer
,
I
hope
she
has
had
the
duty
to
apprise
you
of
her
intrigue
with
the
young
clergyman
;
and
I
know
not
whether
it
meets
with
your
countenance
:
<EOS>
But
now
she
is
absent
for
a
little
while
,
(
for
I
know
he
would
have
followed
her
to
your
village
,
if
she
had
gone
home
;
and
there
,
perhaps
,
they
would
have
ruined
one
another
,
by
marrying
,
)
<EOS>
I
doubt
not
I
shall
bring
him
to
see
his
interest
,
and
that
he
engages
not
before
he
knows
how
to
provide
for
a
wife
:
<EOS>
And
when
that
can
be
done
,
let
them
come
together
in
God
's
name
,
for
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
expect
not
to
be
answered
on
this
head
,
but
by
your
good
opinion
,
and
the
confidence
you
may
repose
in
my
honour
:
being
                                   
"
Your
hearty
friend
to
serve
you

P.
S.
 
<EOS>
I
find
my
man
John
has
been
the
manager
of
the
correspondence
,
in
which
such
liberties
have
been
taken
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
soon
,
in
a
manner
that
becomes
me
,
let
the
saucy
fellow
know
how
much
I
resent
his
part
of
the
affair
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
hard
thing
,
that
a
man
of
my
character
in
the
world
should
be
used
thus
freely
by
his
own
servants
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
is
easy
to
guess
at
the
poor
old
man
's
concern
,
upon
reading
this
letter
from
a
gentleman
of
so
much
consideration
.
 
<EOS>
He
knew
not
what
course
to
take
,
and
had
no
manner
of
doubt
of
his
poor
daughter
's
innocence
,
and
that
foul
play
was
designed
her
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
he
sometimes
hoped
the
best
,
and
was
ready
to
believe
the
surmised
correspondence
between
the
clergyman
and
her
,
having
not
received
the
letters
she
wrote
,
which
would
have
cleared
up
that
affair
.
  
<EOS>
But
,
after
all
,
he
resolved
,
as
well
to
quiet
his
own
as
her
mother
's
uneasiness
,
to
undertake
a
journey
to
the
"
squire
's
;
and
leaving
his
poor
wife
to
excuse
him
to
the
farmer
who
employed
him
,
he
set
out
that
very
evening
,
late
as
it
was
;
and
travelling
all
night
,
found
himself
,
soon
after
day
-
light
,
at
the
gate
of
the
gentleman
,
before
the
family
was
up
:
<EOS>
and
there
he
sat
down
to
rest
himself
till
he
should
see
somebody
stirring
.
  
<EOS>
The
grooms
were
the
first
he
saw
,
coming
out
to
water
their
horses
;
and
he
asked
,
in
so
distressful
a
manner
,
what
was
become
of
Pamela
,
that
they
thought
him
crazy
:
and
said
,
Why
,
what
have
you
to
do
with
Pamela
,
old
fellow
?
 
<EOS>
Get
out
of
the
horses
'
way
.
 
<EOS>
Where
is
your
master
?
<EOS>
said
the
poor
man
:
<EOS>
Pray
,
gentlemen
,
do
n't
be
angry
:
<EOS>
my
heart
's
almost
broken
.
 
<EOS>
He
never
gives
any
thing
at
the
door
<EOS>
,
I
assure
you
,
says
one
of
the
grooms
;
so
you
lose
your
labour
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
a
beggar
yet
,
said
the
poor
old
man
;
I
want
nothing
of
him
,
but
my
Pamela
:
 
O
my
child
!
<EOS>
my
child
!
  
<EOS>
I
'll
be
hanged
,
says
one
of
them
,
if
this
is
not
Mrs.
Pamela
's
father
.
  
<EOS>
Indeed
,
indeed
,
said
he
,
wringing
his
hands
,
I
am
;
and
weeping
<EOS>
,
Where
is
my
child
?
 
<EOS>
Where
is
my
Pamela
?
 
<EOS>
Why
,
father
,
said
one
of
them
,
we
beg
your
pardon
;
but
she
is
gone
home
to
you
:
How
long
have
you
been
come
from
home
?
 
<EOS>
O
!
<EOS>
but
last
night
,
said
he
;
I
have
travelled
all
night
:
<EOS>
Is
the
"
squire
at
home
,
or
is
he
not
?
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
but
he
is
not
stirring
though
,
said
the
groom
,
as
yet
.
 
<EOS>
Thank
God
for
that
!
<EOS>
said
he
;
thank
God
for
that
!
<EOS>
Then
I
hope
I
may
be
permitted
to
speak
to
him
anon
.
 
<EOS>
They
asked
him
to
go
in
,
and
he
stepped
into
the
stable
,
and
sat
down
on
the
stairs
there
,
wiping
his
eyes
,
and
sighing
so
sadly
,
that
it
grieved
the
servants
to
hear
him
.
  
<EOS>
The
family
was
soon
raised
with
a
report
of
Pamela
's
father
coming
to
inquire
after
his
daughter
;
and
the
maids
would
fain
have
had
him
go
into
the
kitchen
.
 
<EOS>
But
Mrs.
Jervis
,
having
been
told
of
his
coming
,
arose
,
and
hastened
down
to
her
parlour
,
and
took
him
in
with
her
,
and
there
heard
all
his
sad
story
,
and
read
the
letter
.
 
<EOS>
She
wept
bitterly
,
but
yet
endeavoured
,
before
him
,
to
hide
her
concern
;
and
said
,
Well
,
Goodman
Andrews
,
I
can
not
help
weeping
at
your
grief
;
but
I
hope
there
is
no
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
Let
nobody
see
this
letter
,
whatever
you
do
.
 
<EOS>
I
dare
say
your
daughter
is
safe
.
  
<EOS>
Well
,
but
,
said
he
,
I
see
you
,
madam
,
know
nothing
about
her
:
 
<EOS>
If
all
was
right
,
so
good
a
gentlewoman
as
you
are
,
would
not
have
been
a
stranger
to
this
.
 
<EOS>
To
be
sure
you
thought
she
was
with
me
!
  
<EOS>
Said
she
,
My
master
does
not
always
inform
his
servants
of
his
proceedings
;
but
you
need
not
doubt
his
honour
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
his
hand
for
it
:
<EOS>
And
you
may
see
he
can
have
no
design
upon
her
,
because
he
is
not
from
hence
,
and
does
not
talk
of
going
hence
.
 
<EOS>
O
that
is
all
I
have
to
hope
for
!
<EOS>
said
he
;
that
is
all
,
indeed
!
 
<EOS>
But
,
said
he
 
and
was
going
on
,
when
the
report
of
his
coming
had
reached
the
"
squire
,
who
came
down
,
in
his
morning
-
gown
and
slippers
,
into
the
parlour
,
where
he
and
Mrs.
Jervis
were
talking
.
  
<EOS>
What
's
the
matter
,
Goodman
Andrews
?
<EOS>
said
he
,
what
's
the
matter
?
 
<EOS>
Oh
my
child
!
<EOS>
said
the
good
old
man
,
give
me
my
child
!
<EOS>
I
beseech
you
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
I
thought
,
says
the
"
squire
,
that
I
had
satisfied
you
about
her
:
<EOS>
Sure
you
have
not
the
letter
I
sent
you
,
written
with
my
own
hand
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
yes
,
<EOS>
but
I
have
,
sir
,
said
he
;
and
that
brought
me
hither
;
and
I
have
walked
all
night
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
man
,
returned
he
,
with
great
seeming
compassion
,
I
am
sorry
for
it
truly
!
 
<EOS>
Why
,
your
daughter
has
made
a
strange
racket
in
my
family
;
and
if
I
thought
it
would
have
disturbed
you
so
much
,
I
would
have
<EOS>
e'en
let
her
go
home
;
but
what
I
did
was
to
serve
her
,
and
you
too
.
 
<EOS>
She
is
very
safe
<EOS>
,
I
do
assure
you
,
Goodman
Andrews
;
and
you
may
take
my
honour
for
it
,
I
would
not
injure
her
for
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
think
I
would
,
Mrs.
Jervis
?
 
<EOS>
No
,
I
hope
not
,
sir
,
said
she
.
 
<EOS>
Hope
not
!
<EOS>
said
the
poor
man
;
so
do
I
;
but
pray
,
<EOS>
sir
,
give
me
my
child
,
that
is
all
I
desire
;
and
I
'll
take
care
<EOS>
no
clergyman
shall
come
near
her
.
  
<EOS>
Why
,
London
is
a
great
way
off
,
said
the
"
squire
,
and
I
ca
n't
send
for
her
back
presently
.
 
<EOS>
What
,
then
,
said
he
,
have
you
sent
my
poor
Pamela
to
London
?
 
<EOS>
I
would
not
have
said
it
so
,
replied
the
"
squire
;
but
I
assure
you
,
upon
my
honour
,
she
is
quite
safe
and
satisfied
,
and
will
quickly
inform
you
of
it
by
letter
.
 
<EOS>
She
is
in
a
reputable
family
,
no
less
than
a
bishop
's
,
and
is
to
wait
on
his
lady
,
till
I
get
the
matter
over
that
I
mentioned
to
you
.
  
<EOS>
O
how
shall
I
know
this
?
<EOS>
replied
he
.
 
<EOS>
What
,
said
the
"
squire
,
pretending
anger
,
am
I
to
be
doubted
?
 
<EOS>
Do
you
believe
I
can
have
any
view
upon
your
daughter
?
 
<EOS>
And
if
I
had
,
do
you
think
I
would
take
such
methods
as
these
to
effect
it
?
 
<EOS>
Why
,
surely
,
man
,
thou
forgettest
whom
thou
talkest
to
.
<EOS>
O
,
sir
,
said
he
,
I
beg
your
pardon
!
<EOS>
but
consider
my
dear
child
is
in
the
case
;
let
me
but
know
what
bishop
,
and
where
;
and
I
will
travel
to
London
on
foot
,
to
see
my
daughter
,
and
then
be
satisfied
.
  
<EOS>
Why
,
Goodman
Andrews
,
I
think
thou
hast
read
romances
as
well
as
thy
daughter
,
and
thy
head
's
turned
with
them
.
 
<EOS>
May
I
have
not
my
word
taken
?
<EOS>
Do
you
think
,
once
more
,
I
would
offer
any
thing
dishonourable
to
your
daughter
?
 
<EOS>
Is
there
any
thing
looks
like
it
?
 
<EOS>
Pr'ythee
,
man
,
recollect
a
little
who
I
am
;
and
if
I
am
not
to
be
believed
,
what
signifies
talking
?
<EOS>
Why
,
sir
,
said
he
,
pray
forgive
me
;
but
there
is
no
harm
to
say
,
<EOS>
What
bishop
's
,
or
whereabouts
?
 
<EOS>
What
,
and
<EOS>
so
you
'd
go
troubling
his
lordship
with
your
impertinent
fears
and
stories
!
 
<EOS>
Will
you
be
satisfied
,
if
you
have
a
letter
from
her
within
a
week
,
it
may
be
less
,
if
she
be
not
negligent
,
to
assure
you
all
is
well
with
her
!
 
<EOS>
Why
that
,
said
the
poor
man
,
will
be
some
comfort
.
 
<EOS>
Well
then
,
said
the
gentleman
,
I
ca
n't
answer
for
her
negligence
,
if
she
do
n't
write
:
<EOS>
And
if
she
should
send
a
letter
to
you
,
Mrs.
Jervis
,
(
for
I
desire
not
to
see
it
;
I
have
had
trouble
enough
about
her
already
,
)
be
sure
you
send
it
by
a
man
and
horse
the
moment
you
receive
it
.
 
<EOS>
To
be
sure
I
will
,
answered
she
.
 
<EOS>
Thank
your
honour
,
said
the
good
man
:
<EOS>
And
then
I
must
wait
with
as
much
patience
as
I
can
for
a
week
,
which
will
be
a
year
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
tell
you
,
said
the
gentleman
,
it
must
be
her
own
fault
if
she
do
n't
write
;
for
'
tis
what
I
insisted
upon
,
for
my
own
reputation
;
and
I
sha
n't
stir
from
this
house
<EOS>
,
I
assure
you
,
till
she
is
heard
from
,
and
that
to
your
satisfaction
.
 
<EOS>
God
bless
your
honour
,
said
the
poor
man
,
as
you
say
and
mean
truth
!
 
<EOS>
Amen
,
Amen
,
Goodman
Andrews
,
said
he
:
<EOS>
you
see
I
am
not
afraid
to
say
Amen
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
Mrs.
Jervis
,
make
the
good
man
as
welcome
as
you
can
;
and
let
me
have
no
uproar
about
the
matter
.
  
<EOS>
He
then
,
whispering
her
,
bid
her
give
him
a
couple
of
guineas
to
bear
his
charges
home
;
telling
him
,
he
should
be
welcome
to
stay
there
till
the
letter
came
,
if
he
would
,
and
be
a
witness
,
that
he
intended
honourably
,
and
not
to
stir
from
his
house
for
one
while
.
  
<EOS>
The
poor
old
man
staid
and
dined
with
Mrs.
Jervis
,
with
some
tolerable
ease
of
mind
,
in
hopes
to
hear
from
his
beloved
daughter
in
a
few
days
;
and
then
accepting
the
present
,
returned
for
his
own
house
,
and
resolved
to
be
as
patient
as
possible
.
  
<EOS>
Meantime
Mrs.
Jervis
,
and
all
the
family
,
were
in
the
utmost
grief
for
the
trick
put
upon
the
poor
Pamela
;
and
she
and
the
steward
represented
it
to
their
master
in
as
moving
terms
as
they
durst
;
but
were
forced
to
rest
satisfied
with
his
general
assurances
of
intending
her
no
harm
;
which
,
however
,
Mrs.
Jervis
little
believed
,
from
the
pretence
he
had
made
in
his
letter
,
of
the
correspondence
between
Pamela
and
the
young
parson
;
which
she
knew
to
be
all
mere
invention
,
though
she
durst
not
say
so
.
  
<EOS>
But
the
week
after
,
they
were
made
a
little
more
easy
by
the
following
letter
brought
by
an
unknown
hand
,
and
left
for
Mrs.
Jervis
,
which
,
how
procured
,
will
be
shewn
in
the
sequel
.
  
<EOS>
"
DEAR
MRS
.
JERVIS
,
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
vilely
tricked
,
and
,
instead
of
being
driven
by
Robin
to
my
dear
father
's
,
I
am
carried
off
,
to
where
,
I
have
no
liberty
to
tell
.
<EOS>
However
,
I
am
at
present
not
used
hardly
,
in
the
main
;
and
write
to
beg
of
you
to
let
my
dear
father
and
mother
(
whose
hearts
must
be
well
nigh
broken
)
know
that
I
am
well
,
and
that
I
am
,
and
,
by
the
grace
of
God
,
ever
will
he

their
honest

as
well

dutiful

PAMELA

"
I
must
neither
send
date
nor
place
;
but
have
most
solemn
assurances
of
honourable
usage
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
the
only
time
my
low
estate
has
been
troublesome
to
me
,
since
it
has
subjected
me
to
the
frights
I
have
undergone
.
 
<EOS>
Love

your
good
self
,
and
all
my
dear

Adieu

<EOS>
adieu

<EOS>
but
pray
for
poor
PAMELA

"
  
<EOS>
This
,
though
it
quieted
not
entirely
their
apprehensions
,
was
shewn
to
the
whole
family
,
and
to
the
gentleman
himself
,
who
pretended
not
to
know
how
it
came
;
and
Mrs.
Jervis
sent
it
away
to
the
good
old
folks
;
who
at
first
suspected
it
was
forged
,
and
not
their
daughter
's
hand
;
but
,
finding
the
contrary
,
they
were
a
little
easier
to
hear
she
was
alive
and
honest
:
and
having
inquired
of
all
their
acquaintance
what
could
be
done
,
and
no
one
being
able
to
put
them
in
a
way
how
to
proceed
,
with
effect
,
on
so
extraordinary
an
occasion
,
against
so
rich
and
so
resolute
a
gentleman
;
and
being
afraid
to
make
matters
worse
,
(
<EOS>
though
they
saw
plainly
enough
,
that
she
was
in
no
bishop
's
family
,
and
so
mistrusted
all
the
rest
of
his
story
,
)
<EOS>
they
applied
themselves
to
prayers
for
their
poor
daughter
,
and
for
an
happy
issue
to
an
affair
that
almost
distracted
them
.
  
<EOS>
We
shall
now
leave
the
honest
old
pair
praying
for
their
dear
Pamela
,
and
return
to
the
account
she
herself
gives
of
all
this
;
having
written
it
journal
-
wise
,
to
amuse
and
employ
her
time
,
in
hopes
some
opportunity
might
offer
to
send
it
to
her
friends
;
and
,
as
was
her
constant
view
,
that
she
might
afterwards
thankfully
look
back
upon
the
dangers
she
had
escaped
,
when
they
should
be
happily
overblown
,
as
in
time
she
hoped
they
would
be
;
and
that
then
she
might
examine
,
and
either
approve
or
repent
of
her
own
conduct
in
them
.
    
<EOS>
O
MY
DEAREST
FATHER
AND
MOTHER
!
  
<EOS>
Let
me
write
,
and
bewail
my
miserable
hard
fate
,
though
I
have
no
hope
how
what
I
write
can
be
conveyed
to
your
hands
!
 
<EOS>
I
have
now
nothing
to
do
,
but
write
and
weep
,
and
fear
and
pray
!
 
<EOS>
But
yet
what
can
I
hope
for
,
when
I
seem
to
be
devoted
,
as
a
victim
to
the
will
of
a
wicked
violator
of
all
the
laws
of
God
and
man
!
 
<EOS>
But
,
gracious
Heaven
,
forgive
me
my
rashness
and
despondency
!
 
<EOS>
O
let
me
not
sin
against
thee
;
for
thou
best
knowest
what
is
fittest
for
thy
poor
handmaid
!
 
<EOS>
And
as
thou
sufferest
not
thy
poor
creatures
to
be
tempted
above
what
they
can
bear
,
I
will
resign
myself
to
thy
good
pleasure
:
<EOS>
And
still
,
I
hope
,
desperate
as
my
condition
seems
,
that
as
these
trials
are
not
of
my
own
seeking
,
nor
the
effects
of
my
presumption
and
vanity
,
I
shall
be
enabled
to
overcome
them
,
and
,
in
God
's
own
good
time
,
be
delivered
from
them
.
  
<EOS>
Thus
do
I
pray
imperfectly
,
as
I
am
forced
by
my
distracting
fears
and
apprehensions
;
and
O
join
with
me
,
my
dear
parents
!
 
<EOS>
But
,
alas
!
<EOS>
how
can
you
know
,
how
can
I
reveal
to
you
,
the
dreadful
situation
of
your
poor
daughter
!
 
<EOS>
The
unhappy
Pamela
may
be
undone
(
which
God
forbid
,
and
sooner
deprive
me
of
life
!
)
<EOS>
before
you
can
know
her
hard
lot
!
  
<EOS>
O
the
unparalleled
wickedness
,
stratagems
,
and
devices
,
of
those
who
call
themselves
gentlemen
,
yet
pervert
the
design
of
Providence
,
in
giving
them
ample
means
to
do
good
,
to
their
own
everlasting
perdition
,
and
the
ruin
of
poor
oppressed
innocence
!
  
<EOS>
But
now
I
will
tell
you
what
has
befallen
me
;
and
yet
,
how
shall
you
receive
it
?
 
<EOS>
Here
is
no
honest
John
to
carry
my
letters
to
you
!
 
<EOS>
And
,
besides
,
I
am
watched
in
all
my
steps
;
and
no
doubt
shall
be
,
till
my
hard
fate
may
ripen
his
wicked
projects
for
my
ruin
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
every
day
,
however
,
write
my
sad
state
;
and
some
way
,
perhaps
,
may
be
opened
to
send
the
melancholy
scribble
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
alas
!
<EOS>
when
you
know
it
,
what
will
it
do
but
aggravate
your
troubles
?
 
<EOS>
For
,
O
!
<EOS>
what
can
the
abject
poor
do
against
the
mighty
rich
,
when
they
are
determined
to
oppress
?
  
<EOS>
Well
,
but
I
must
proceed
to
write
what
I
had
hoped
to
tell
you
in
a
few
hours
,
when
I
believed
I
should
receive
your
grateful
blessings
,
on
my
return
to
you
from
so
many
hardships
.
  
<EOS>
I
will
begin
with
my
account
from
the
last
letter
I
wrote
you
,
in
which
I
enclosed
my
poor
stuff
of
verses
;
and
continue
it
at
times
,
as
I
have
opportunity
;
though
,
as
I
said
,
I
know
not
how
it
can
reach
you
.
  
<EOS>
The
long
-
hoped
for
Thursday
morning
came
,
when
I
was
to
set
out
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
taken
my
leave
of
my
fellow
-
servants
overnight
;
and
a
mournful
leave
<EOS>
it
was
to
us
all
:
for
men
,
as
well
as
women
servants
,
wept
much
to
part
with
me
;
and
,
for
my
part
,
I
was
overwhelmed
with
tears
,
and
the
affecting
instances
of
their
esteem
.
 
<EOS>
They
all
would
have
made
me
little
presents
,
as
tokens
of
their
love
;
but
I
would
not
take
any
thing
from
the
lower
servants
,
to
be
sure
.
 
<EOS>
But
Mr.
Longman
would
have
me
accept
of
several
yards
of
Holland
,
and
a
silver
snuff
-
box
,
and
a
gold
ring
,
which
he
desired
me
to
keep
for
his
sake
;
and
he
wept
over
me
;
but
said
,
I
am
sure
so
good
a
maiden
God
will
bless
;
and
though
you
return
to
your
poor
father
again
,
and
his
low
estate
,
yet
Providence
will
find
you
out
:
<EOS>
Remember
I
tell
you
so
;
and
one
day
,
though
I
may
n't
live
to
see
it
,
you
will
be
rewarded
.
  
<EOS>
I
said
,
O
,
<EOS>
dear
Mr.
Longman
!
<EOS>
you
make
me
too
rich
,
and
too
mody
;
and
yet
I
must
be
a
beggar
before
my
time
for
I
shall
want
often
to
be
scribbling
,
(
little
thinking
it
would
be
my
only
employment
so
soon
,
)
and
I
will
beg
you
,
sir
,
to
favour
me
with
some
paper
;
and
,
as
soon
as
I
get
home
,
I
will
write
you
a
letter
,
to
thank
you
for
all
your
kindness
to
me
;
and
a
letter
to
good
Mrs.
Jervis
too
.
  
<EOS>
This
was
lucky
;
for
I
should
have
had
none
else
,
but
at
the
pleasure
of
my
rough
-
natured
governess
,
as
I
may
call
her
;
but
now
I
can
write
to
ease
my
mind
,
though
I
ca
n't
send
it
to
you
;
and
write
what
I
please
,
for
she
knows
not
how
well
I
am
provided
:
for
good
Mr.
Longman
gave
me
above
forty
sheets
of
paper
,
and
a
dozen
pens
,
and
a
little
phial
of
ink
;
which
last
I
wrapped
in
paper
,
and
put
in
my
pocket
;
and
some
wax
and
wafers
.
  
<EOS>
O
dear
sir
,
said
I
,
you
have
set
me
up
.
 
<EOS>
How
shall
I
requite
you
?
 
<EOS>
He
said
,
By
a
kiss
,
<EOS>
my
fair
mistress
:
<EOS>
And
I
gave
it
very
willingly
;
for
he
is
a
good
old
man
.
  
<EOS>
Rachel
and
Hannah
cried
sadly
,
when
I
took
my
leave
;
and
Jane
,
who
sometimes
used
to
be
a
little
crossish
,
and
Cicely
too
,
wept
sadly
,
and
said
,
they
would
pray
for
me
;
but
poor
Jane
,
I
doubt
,
will
forget
that
;
for
she
seldom
says
her
prayers
for
herself
:
<EOS>
More
's
the
pity
!
  
<EOS>
Then
Arthur
the
gardener
,
our
Robin
the
coachman
,
and
Lincolnshire
Robin
too
,
who
was
to
carry
me
,
were
very
civil
;
and
both
had
tears
in
their
eyes
;
which
I
thought
then
very
good
-
natured
in
Lincolnshire
Robin
,
because
he
knew
but
little
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
But
since
,
I
find
he
might
well
be
concerned
;
for
he
had
then
his
instructions
,
it
seems
,
and
knew
how
he
was
to
be
a
means
to
entrap
me
.
  
<EOS>
Then
our
other
three
footmen
,
Harry
,
Isaac
,
and
Benjamin
,
and
grooms
,
and
helpers
,
were
very
much
affected
likewise
;
and
the
poor
little
scullion
-
boy
,
Tommy
,
was
ready
to
run
over
for
grief
.
  
<EOS>
They
had
got
all
together
over
-
night
,
expecting
to
be
differently
employed
in
the
morning
;
and
they
all
begged
to
shake
hands
with
me
,
and
I
kissed
the
maidens
,
and
prayed
to
God
to
bless
them
all
;
and
thanked
them
for
all
their
love
and
kindness
to
me
:
and
,
indeed
,
I
was
forced
to
leave
them
sooner
than
I
would
,
because
I
could
not
stand
it
:
<EOS>
Indeed
I
could
not
.
 
<EOS>
Harry
(
I
could
not
have
thought
it
;
for
he
is
a
little
wildish
,
they
say
)
cried
till
he
sobbed
again
.
 
<EOS>
John
,
poor
honest
John
,
was
not
then
come
back
from
you
.
 
<EOS>
But
as
for
the
butler
,
Mr.
Jonathan
,
he
could
not
stay
in
company
.
  
<EOS>
I
thought
to
have
told
you
a
deal
about
this
;
but
I
have
worse
things
to
employ
my
thoughts
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jervis
,
good
Mrs.
Jervis
,
cried
all
night
long
;
and
I
comforted
her
all
I
could
:
<EOS>
And
she
made
me
promise
,
that
if
my
master
went
to
London
to
attend
parliament
,
or
to
Lincolnshire
,
I
would
come
and
stay
a
week
with
her
:
and
she
would
have
given
me
money
;
but
I
would
not
take
it
.
  
<EOS>
Well
,
next
morning
came
,
and
I
wondered
I
saw
nothing
of
poor
honest
John
;
for
I
waited
to
take
leave
of
him
,
and
thank
him
for
all
his
civilities
to
me
and
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
suppose
he
was
sent
farther
by
my
master
,
and
so
could
not
return
;
and
I
desired
to
be
remembered
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
And
when
Mrs.
Jervis
told
me
,
with
a
sad
heart
,
the
chariot
was
ready
with
four
horses
to
it
<EOS>
,
I
was
just
upon
sinking
into
the
ground
,
though
I
wanted
to
be
with
you
.
  
<EOS>
My
master
was
above
stairs
,
and
never
asked
to
see
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
glad
of
it
in
the
main
;
but
he
knew
,
false
heart
as
he
is
,
that
I
was
not
to
be
out
of
his
reach
.
 
<EOS>
O
preserve
me
,
Heaven
,
from
his
power
,
and
from
his
wickedness
!
  
<EOS>
Well
,
they
were
not
suffered
to
go
with
me
one
step
,
as
I
writ
to
you
before
;
for
he
stood
at
the
window
to
see
me
go
.
 
<EOS>
And
in
the
passage
to
the
gate
,
out
of
his
sight
,
there
they
stood
all
of
them
,
in
two
rows
;
and
we
could
say
nothing
on
both
sides
,
but
God
bless
you
!
<EOS>
and
God
bless
you
!
 
<EOS>
But
Harry
carried
my
own
bundle
,
my
third
bundle
,
as
I
was
used
to
call
it
,
to
the
coach
,
with
some
plumb
-
cake
,
and
diet
-
bread
,
<EOS>
made
for
me
over
-
night
,
and
some
sweet
-
meats
,
and
six
bottles
of
Canary
wine
,
which
Mrs.
Jervis
would
make
me
take
in
a
basket
,
to
cheer
our
hearts
now
and
then
,
when
we
got
together
,
as
she
said
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
kissed
all
the
maids
again
,
and
shook
hands
with
the
men
again
:
but
Mr.
Jonathan
and
Mr.
Longman
were
not
there
;
and
then
I
tripped
down
the
steps
to
the
chariot
,
Mrs.
Jervis
crying
most
sadly
.
  
<EOS>
I
looked
up
when
I
got
to
the
chariot
,
and
I
saw
my
master
at
the
window
,
in
his
gown
;
and
I
courtesied
three
times
to
him
very
low
,
and
prayed
for
him
with
my
hands
lifted
up
;
for
I
could
not
speak
;
indeed
I
was
not
able
:
<EOS>
And
he
bowed
his
head
to
me
,
which
made
me
then
very
glad
he
would
take
such
notice
of
me
;
and
in
I
stepped
,
and
was
ready
to
burst
with
grief
;
and
could
only
,
till
Robin
began
to
drive
,
wave
my
white
handkerchief
to
them
,
wet
with
my
tears
:
and
,
at
last
,
away
he
drove
,
<EOS>
Jehu
-
like
,
as
they
say
,
out
of
the
court
-
yard
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
too
soon
found
I
had
cause
for
greater
and
deeper
grief
.
  
<EOS>
Well
,
said
I
to
myself
,
at
this
rate
I
shall
soon
be
with
my
dear
father
and
mother
;
and
till
I
had
got
,
as
I
supposed
,
half
-
way
,
I
thought
of
the
good
friends
I
had
left
:
<EOS>
And
when
,
on
stopping
for
a
little
bait
to
the
horses
,
Robin
told
me
I
was
near
half
-
way
,
I
thought
it
was
high
time
to
wipe
my
eyes
,
and
think
to
whom
I
was
going
;
as
then
,
alack
for
me
!
<EOS>
I
thought
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
began
to
ponder
what
a
meeting
I
should
have
with
you
;
<EOS>
how
glad
you
'd
both
be
to
see
me
come
safe
and
innocent
to
you
,
after
all
my
dangers
:
<EOS>
and
so
I
began
to
comfort
myself
,
and
to
banish
the
other
gloomy
side
from
my
mind
;
though
,
too
,
it
returned
now
and
then
;
for
I
should
be
ungrateful
not
to
love
them
for
their
love
.
  
<EOS>
Well
,
I
believe
I
set
out
about
eight
o'clock
in
the
morning
;
and
I
wondered
and
wondered
,
when
it
was
about
two
,
as
I
saw
by
a
church
dial
,
in
a
little
village
as
we
passed
through
,
that
I
was
still
more
and
more
out
of
my
knowledge
.
 
<EOS>
Hey
-
day
,
thought
<EOS>
I
,
to
drive
this
strange
pace
,
and
to
be
so
long
a
going
a
little
<EOS>
more
than
twenty
miles
,
is
very
odd
!
 
<EOS>
But
to
be
sure
,
thought
I
,
Robin
knows
the
way
.
  
<EOS>
At
last
he
stopped
,
and
looked
about
him
,
as
if
he
was
at
a
loss
for
the
road
;
and
I
said
,
<EOS>
Mr.
Robert
,
sure
you
are
out
of
the
way
!
 
<EOS>
I
'm
afraid
I
am
,
said
he
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
ca
n't
be
much
;
I
'll
ask
the
first
person
I
see
.
<EOS>
Pray
do
,
said
I
;
and
he
gave
his
horses
a
mouthful
of
bay
:
and
I
gave
him
some
cake
,
and
two
glasses
of
Canary
wine
;
and
stopt
about
half
an
hour
in
all
.
 
<EOS>
Then
he
drove
on
very
fast
again
.
  
<EOS>
I
had
so
much
to
think
of
,
of
the
dangers
I
now
doubted
not
I
had
escaped
,
of
the
loving
friends
I
had
left
,
and
my
best
friends
I
was
going
to
;
and
the
many
things
I
had
to
relate
to
you
;
that
I
the
less
thought
of
the
way
,
till
I
was
startled
out
of
my
meditations
by
the
sun
beginning
to
set
,
and
still
the
man
driving
on
,
and
his
horses
sweating
and
foaming
;
and
then
I
began
to
be
alarmed
all
at
once
,
and
called
to
him
;
and
he
said
he
had
horrid
ill
luck
,
for
he
had
come
several
miles
out
of
the
way
,
but
was
now
right
,
and
should
get
in
still
before
it
was
quite
dark
.
 
<EOS>
My
heart
began
then
to
misgive
me
a
little
,
and
I
was
very
much
fatigued
;
for
I
had
no
sleep
for
several
nights
before
,
to
signify
;
and
at
last
I
said
,
Pray
Mr.
Robert
,
there
is
a
town
before
us
<EOS>
,
what
do
you
call
it
?
 
<EOS>
If
we
are
so
much
out
of
the
way
,
we
had
better
put
up
there
,
for
the
night
comes
on
apace
:
<EOS>
And
,
Lord
protect
me
!
<EOS>
thought
I
,
I
shall
have
new
dangers
,
mayhap
,
to
encounter
with
the
man
,
who
have
escaped
the
master
 
little
thinking
of
the
base
contrivance
of
the
latter
.
 
<EOS>
Says
he
,
I
am
just
there
:
'
<EOS>
Tis
but
a
mile
on
one
side
of
the
town
before
us
.
 
<EOS>
Nay
,
said
I
,
I
may
be
mistaken
;
for
it
is
a
good
while
since
I
was
this
way
;
but
I
am
sure
the
face
of
the
country
here
is
nothing
like
what
I
remember
it
.
  
<EOS>
He
pretended
to
be
much
out
of
humour
with
himself
for
mistaking
the
way
,
and
at
last
stopped
at
a
farmhouse
,
about
two
miles
beyond
the
village
I
had
seen
;
and
it
was
then
almost
dark
,
and
he
alighted
,
and
said
,
We
must
make
shift
here
;
for
I
am
quite
out
.
  
<EOS>
Lord
,
thought
I
,
be
good
to
the
poor
Pamela
!
 
<EOS>
More
trials
still
!
 
<EOS>
What
will
befall
me
next
?
  
<EOS>
The
farmer
's
wife
,
and
maid
,
and
daughter
,
came
out
;
and
the
wife
said
,
What
brings
you
this
way
at
this
time
of
night
,
Mr.
Robert
?
 
<EOS>
And
with
a
lady
too
?
 
<EOS>
Then
I
began
to
be
frightened
out
of
my
wits
;
and
laying
middle
and
both
ends
together
,
I
fell
a
crying
,
and
said
,
God
give
me
patience
!
 
<EOS>
I
am
undone
for
certain
!
 
<EOS>
Pray
,
mistress
,
said
I
,
do
you
know
"
Squire
B
#
#
#
#
,
of
Bedfordshire
?
  
<EOS>
The
wicked
coachman
would
have
prevented
the
answering
me
;
but
the
simple
daughter
said
,
Know
his
worship
!
<EOS>
yes
,
surely
!
<EOS>
why
he
is
my
father
's
landlord
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
said
I
,
then
I
am
undone
;
undone
for
ever
!
 
<EOS>
O
,
wicked
wretch
!
<EOS>
what
have
I
done
to
you
,
said
I
to
the
coachman
,
to
serve
me
thus
?
 
<EOS>
Vile
tool
of
a
wicked
master
!
 
<EOS>
Faith
,
said
the
fellow
,
I
am
sorry
this
task
was
put
upon
me
;
but
I
could
not
help
it
.
 
<EOS>
But
make
the
best
of
it
now
;
here
are
very
civil
reputable
folks
;
and
you
'll
be
safe
here
<EOS>
,
I
'll
assure
you
.
 
<EOS>
Let
me
get
out
,
said
I
,
and
I
'll
walk
back
to
the
town
we
came
through
,
late
as
it
is
:
 
<EOS>
For
I
will
not
enter
here
.
  
<EOS>
Said
the
farmer
's
wife
,
You
'll
be
very
well
used
here
<EOS>
,
I
'll
assure
you
,
young
gentlewoman
,
and
have
better
conveniences
than
any
where
in
the
village
.
 
<EOS>
I
matter
not
conveniences
,
said
I
:
<EOS>
I
am
betrayed
and
undone
!
<EOS>
As
you
have
a
daughter
of
your
own
,
pity
me
,
and
let
me
know
if
your
landlord
,
as
you
call
him
,
be
here
!
 
<EOS>
No
,
I
'll
assure
you
he
is
not
,
said
she
.
  
<EOS>
And
then
came
the
farmer
,
a
good
-
like
sort
of
man
,
grave
,
and
well
-
behaved
;
and
spoke
to
me
in
such
sort
,
as
made
me
a
little
pacified
;
and
seeing
no
help
for
it
<EOS>
,
I
went
in
;
and
the
wife
immediately
conducted
me
up
stairs
to
the
best
apartment
,
and
told
me
,
that
was
mine
as
long
as
I
staid
:
<EOS>
and
nobody
should
come
near
me
<EOS>
but
when
I
called
.
 
<EOS>
I
threw
myself
on
the
bed
in
the
room
,
tired
and
frightened
to
death
almost
;
and
gave
way
to
the
most
excessive
fit
of
grief
that
I
ever
had
.
  
<EOS>
The
daughter
came
up
,
and
said
,
Mr.
Robert
had
given
her
a
letter
to
give
me
;
and
there
it
was
.
 
<EOS>
I
raised
myself
,
and
saw
it
was
the
hand
and
seal
of
the
wicked
wretch
,
my
master
,
directed
to
Mrs.
Pamela
Andrews
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
a
little
better
than
to
have
him
here
;
though
,
if
he
had
,
he
must
have
been
brought
through
the
air
;
for
I
thought
I
was
.
  
<EOS>
The
good
woman
(
for
I
began
to
see
things
about
a
little
reputable
,
and
no
guile
appearing
in
them
,
but
rather
a
face
of
grief
for
my
grief
)
offered
me
a
glass
of
some
cordial
water
,
which
I
accepted
,
for
I
was
ready
to
sink
;
and
then
I
sat
up
in
a
chair
<EOS>
a
little
,
though
very
faintish
:
and
they
brought
me
two
candles
,
and
lighted
a
brushwood
fire
;
and
said
,
if
I
called
,
I
should
be
waited
on
instantly
;
and
so
left
me
to
ruminate
on
my
sad
condition
,
and
to
read
my
letter
,
which
I
was
not
able
to
do
presently
.
 
<EOS>
After
I
had
a
little
come
to
myself
<EOS>
,
I
found
it
to
contain
these
words
:
  
"
DEAR
PAMELA
,
  
"
<EOS>
The
passion
I
have
for
you
,
and
your
obstinacy
,
have
constrained
me
to
act
by
you
in
a
manner
that
I
know
will
occasion
you
great
trouble
and
fatigue
,
both
of
mind
and
body
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
,
forgive
me
,
my
dear
girl
;
for
,
although
I
have
taken
this
step
,
I
will
,
by
all
that
's
good
and
holy
!
<EOS>
use
you
honourably
.
 
<EOS>
Suffer
not
your
fears
to
transport
you
to
a
behaviour
that
will
be
disreputable
to
us
both
:
for
the
place
where
you
'll
receive
this
,
is
a
farm
that
belongs
to
me
;
and
the
people
civil
,
honest
,
and
obliging
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
,
by
this
time
,
be
far
on
your
way
to
the
place
I
have
allotted
for
your
abode
for
a
few
weeks
,
till
I
have
managed
some
affairs
,
that
will
make
me
shew
myself
to
you
in
a
much
different
light
,
than
you
may
possibly
apprehend
from
this
rash
action
:
And
to
convince
you
,
that
I
mean
no
harm
,
I
do
assure
you
,
that
the
house
you
are
going
to
,
shall
be
so
much
at
your
command
,
that
even
I
myself
will
not
approach
it
without
leave
from
you
.
 
<EOS>
So
make
yourself
easy
;
be
discreet
and
prudent
;
and
a
happier
turn
shall
reward
these
your
troubles
,
than
you
may
at
present
apprehend
.
  
<EOS>
"
Meantime
I
pity
the
fatigue
you
will
have
,
if
this
come
to
your
hand
in
the
place
I
have
directed
:
and
will
write
to
your
father
to
satisfy
him
,
that
nothing
but
what
is
honourable
shall
be
offered
to
you
,
by
               
Your
passionate
admirer
,
(
so
I
must
style
myself
,

Do
n't
think
hardly
of
poor
Robin
:
You
have
so
possessed
all
my
servants
in
your
favour
,
that
I
find
they
had
rather
serve
you
than
me
;
and
'
tis
reluctantly
the
poor
fellow
undertook
this
task
;
and
I
was
forced
to
submit
to
assure
him
of
my
honourable
intentions
to
you
,
which
I
am
fully
resolved
to
make
good
,
if
you
compel
me
not
to
a
contrary
conduct
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
but
too
well
apprehended
that
the
letter
was
only
to
pacify
me
for
the
present
;
but
as
my
danger
was
not
so
immediate
as
I
had
reason
to
dread
,
and
he
had
promised
to
forbear
coming
to
me
,
and
to
write
to
you
,
my
dear
parents
,
to
quiet
your
concern
,
I
was
a
little
more
easy
than
before
<EOS>
and
I
made
shift
to
eat
a
little
bit
of
boiled
chicken
they
had
got
for
me
,
and
drank
a
glass
of
my
sack
,
and
made
each
of
them
do
so
too
.
  
<EOS>
But
after
I
had
so
done
,
I
was
again
a
little
flustered
;
for
in
came
the
coachman
with
the
look
of
a
hangman
,
I
thought
,
and
madamed
me
up
strangely
;
telling
me
,
he
would
beg
me
to
get
ready
to
pursue
my
journey
by
five
in
the
morning
,
or
else
he
should
be
late
in
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
quite
grieved
at
this
;
for
I
began
not
to
dislike
my
company
,
considering
how
things
stood
;
and
was
in
hopes
to
get
a
party
among
them
,
and
so
to
put
myself
into
any
worthy
protection
in
the
neighbourhood
,
rather
than
go
forward
.
  
<EOS>
When
he
withdrew
,
I
began
to
tamper
with
the
farmer
and
his
wife
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
alas
!
<EOS>
they
had
had
a
letter
delivered
them
at
the
same
time
I
had
;
so
securely
had
Lucifer
put
it
into
his
head
to
do
his
work
;
and
they
only
shook
their
heads
,
and
seemed
to
pity
me
;
and
so
I
was
forced
to
give
over
that
hope
.
  
<EOS>
However
,
the
good
farmer
shewed
me
his
letter
;
which
I
copied
as
follows
:
for
it
discovers
the
deep
arts
of
this
wicked
master
;
and
how
resolved
he
seems
to
be
on
my
ruin
,
by
the
pains
he
took
to
deprive
me
of
all
hopes
of
freeing
myself
from
his
power
.
  
<EOS>
"
FARMER
NORTON
,
  
<EOS>
"
I
send
to
your
house
,
for
one
night
only
,
a
young
gentlewoman
,
much
against
her
will
,
who
has
deeply
embarked
in
a
love
affair
,
which
will
be
her
ruin
,
as
well
as
the
person
's
to
whom
she
wants
to
betroth
herself
.
<EOS>
I
have
,
to
oblige
her
father
,
ordered
her
to
be
carried
to
one
of
my
houses
,
where
she
will
be
well
used
,
to
try
,
if
by
absence
,
and
expostulation
with
both
,
they
can
be
brought
to
know
their
own
interest
<EOS>
and
I
am
sure
you
will
use
her
kindly
for
my
sake
:
for
,
excepting
this
matter
,
which
she
will
not
own
,
she
does
not
want
prudence
and
discretion
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
acknowledge
any
trouble
you
shall
be
at
in
this
matter
the
first
opportunity
;
and
am
                              
"
Your
Friend
and
Servant
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
had
said
,
too
cunningly
for
me
,
that
I
would
not
own
this
pretended
love
affair
;
so
that
he
had
provided
them
not
to
believe
me
,
say
what
I
would
;
and
as
they
were
his
tenants
,
who
all
love
him
,
(
for
he
has
some
amiable
qualities
,
and
so
he
had
need
!
)
<EOS>
I
saw
all
my
plot
cut
out
,
and
so
was
forced
to
say
the
less
.
  
<EOS>
I
wept
bitterly
,
however
;
for
I
found
he
was
too
hard
for
me
,
as
well
in
his
contrivances
as
riches
;
and
so
had
recourse
again
to
my
only
refuge
,
comforting
myself
,
that
God
never
fails
to
take
the
innocent
heart
into
his
protection
,
and
is
alone
able
to
baffle
and
confound
the
devices
of
the
mighty
.
 
<EOS>
Nay
,
the
farmer
was
so
prepossessed
with
the
contents
of
his
letter
,
that
he
began
to
praise
his
care
and
concern
for
me
,
and
to
advise
me
against
entertaining
addresses
without
my
friends
'
advice
and
consent
;
and
made
me
the
subject
of
a
lesson
for
his
daughter
's
improvement
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
was
glad
to
shut
up
this
discourse
;
for
I
saw
I
was
not
likely
to
be
believed
.
  
<EOS>
I
sent
,
however
,
to
tell
my
driver
,
that
I
was
so
fatigued
<EOS>
,
I
could
not
get
out
<EOS>
so
soon
the
next
morning
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
insisted
upon
it
,
and
said
,
It
would
make
my
day
's
journey
the
lighter
;
and
I
found
he
was
a
more
faithful
servant
to
his
master
,
notwithstanding
what
he
wrote
of
his
reluctance
,
than
I
could
have
wished
<EOS>
:
I
saw
still
more
and
more
,
that
all
was
deep
dissimulation
,
and
contrivance
worse
and
worse
.
  
<EOS>
Indeed
I
might
have
shewn
them
his
letter
to
me
,
as
a
full
confutation
of
his
to
them
;
but
I
saw
no
probability
of
engaging
them
in
my
behalf
:
and
so
thought
it
signified
little
,
as
I
was
to
go
away
so
soon
,
to
enter
more
particularly
into
the
matter
with
them
;
and
besides
,
I
saw
they
were
not
inclinable
to
let
me
stay
longer
,
for
fear
of
disobliging
him
<EOS>
so
I
went
to
bed
,
but
had
very
little
rest
:
and
they
would
make
their
servant
-
maid
bear
me
company
in
the
chariot
five
miles
,
early
in
the
morning
,
and
she
was
to
walk
hack
.
  
<EOS>
I
had
contrived
in
my
thoughts
,
when
I
was
on
my
way
in
the
chariot
,
on
Friday
morning
,
that
when
we
came
into
some
town
to
bait
,
as
he
must
do
for
the
horses
'
sake
,
I
would
,
at
the
inn
,
apply
myself
,
if
I
saw
I
any
way
<EOS>
could
,
to
the
mistress
of
the
inn
,
and
tell
her
the
case
,
and
to
refuse
to
go
farther
,
having
nobody
but
this
wicked
coachman
to
contend
with
.
  
<EOS>
Well
,
I
was
very
full
of
this
project
,
and
in
great
hopes
,
some
how
or
other
,
to
extricate
myself
in
this
way
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
oh
!
<EOS>
the
artful
wretch
had
provided
for
even
this
last
refuge
of
mine
;
for
when
we
came
to
put
up
at
a
large
town
on
the
way
,
to
eat
a
morsel
for
dinner
,
and
I
was
fully
resolved
to
execute
my
project
,
who
should
be
at
the
inn
that
he
put
up
at
,
but
the
wicked
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
expecting
me
!
 
<EOS>
And
her
sister
-
in
-
law
was
the
mistress
of
it
;
and
she
had
provided
a
little
entertainment
for
me
.
  
<EOS>
And
this
I
found
,
when
I
desired
,
as
soon
as
I
came
in
,
to
speak
with
the
mistress
of
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
She
came
to
me
:
and
<EOS>
I
said
,
I
am
a
poor
unhappy
young
body
<EOS>
,
that
want
your
advice
and
assistance
;
and
you
seem
to
be
a
good
sort
of
a
gentlewoman
,
that
would
assist
an
oppressed
innocent
person
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
madam
,
said
she
,
I
hope
you
guess
right
;
and
I
have
the
happiness
to
know
something
of
the
matter
before
you
speak
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
call
my
sister
Jewkes
.
 
<EOS>
Jewkes
!
<EOS>
Jewkes
!
<EOS>
thought
I
<EOS>
;
I
have
heard
of
that
name
;
I
do
n't
like
it
.
  
<EOS>
Then
the
wicked
creature
appeared
,
whom
I
had
never
seen
but
once
before
,
and
I
was
terrified
out
of
my
wits
.
 
<EOS>
No
stratagem
,
thought
I
,
not
one
!
<EOS>
for
a
poor
innocent
girl
;
but
every
thing
to
turn
out
against
me
;
that
is
hard
indeed
!
  
<EOS>
So
I
began
to
pull
in
my
horns
,
as
they
say
,
for
I
saw
I
was
now
worse
off
than
at
the
farmer
's
.
  
<EOS>
The
naughty
woman
came
up
to
me
with
an
air
of
confidence
,
and
kissed
me
:
See
,
sister
,
<EOS>
said
she
,
here
's
a
charming
creature
!
 
<EOS>
Would
she
not
tempt
the
best
lord
in
the
land
to
run
away
with
her
?
 
<EOS>
O
frightful
!
<EOS>
thought
I
<EOS>
;
here
's
an
avowal
of
the
matter
at
once
:
I
am
now
gone
<EOS>
,
that
's
certain
.
<EOS>
And
so
was
quite
silent
and
confounded
;
and
seeing
no
help
for
it
,
(
for
she
would
not
part
with
me
out
of
her
sight
)
<EOS>
I
was
forced
to
set
out
with
her
in
the
chariot
for
she
came
thither
on
horseback
,
with
a
man
-
servant
,
who
rode
by
us
the
rest
of
the
way
,
leading
her
horse
:
and
now
I
gave
over
all
thoughts
of
redemption
,
and
was
in
a
desponding
condition
indeed
.
  
<EOS>
Well
,
thought
I
,
here
are
strange
pains
taken
to
ruin
a
poor
innocent
,
helpless
,
and
even
worthless
young
body
.
 
<EOS>
This
plot
is
laid
too
deep
,
and
has
been
too
long
hatching
,
to
be
baffled
,
I
fear
.
 
<EOS>
But
then
I
put
my
trust
in
God
,
who
I
knew
was
able
to
do
every
thing
for
me
,
when
all
other
possible
means
should
fail
:
<EOS>
and
in
him
I
was
resolved
to
confide
.
  
<EOS>
You
may
see
(
<EOS>
Yet
,
oh
!
<EOS>
that
kills
me
;
for
I
know
not
whether
ever
you
can
see
what
I
now
write
or
<EOS>
no
 
Else
you
will
see
)
 
<EOS>
what
sort
of
woman
that
Mrs.
Jewkes
is
,
compared
to
good
Mrs.
Jervis
,
by
this
:
#
#
#
#
  
Every
now
<EOS>
and
then
she
would
be
staring
in
my
face
,
in
the
chariot
,
and
squeezing
my
hand
,
and
saying
,
Why
,
you
are
very
pretty
,
my
silent
dear
!
<EOS>
And
once
she
offered
to
kiss
me
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
said
,
I
do
n't
like
this
sort
of
carriage
,
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
;
it
is
not
like
two
persons
of
one
sex
.
 
<EOS>
She
fell
a
laughing
very
confidently
,
and
said
,
That
's
prettily
said
,
I
vow
!
 
<EOS>
Then
thou
hadst
rather
be
kissed
by
the
other
sex
?
 
<EOS>
"
I
fackins
,
I
commend
thee
for
that
!
  
<EOS>
I
was
sadly
teased
with
her
impertinence
,
and
bold
way
;
but
no
wonder
;
she
was
innkeeper
's
housekeeper
,
before
she
came
to
my
master
;
and
those
sort
of
creatures
do
n't
want
confidence
,
you
know
:
<EOS>
and
indeed
she
made
nothing
to
talk
boldly
on
twenty
occasions
;
and
said
two
or
three
times
,
when
she
saw
the
tears
every
now
<EOS>
and
then
,
as
we
rid
,
trickle
down
my
cheeks
,
I
was
sorely
hurt
,
truly
,
to
have
the
handsomest
and
finest
young
gentleman
in
five
counties
in
love
with
me
!
  
<EOS>
So
I
find
I
am
got
into
the
hands
of
a
wicked
procuress
;
and
if
I
was
not
safe
with
good
Mrs.
Jervis
,
and
where
every
body
loved
me
,
what
a
dreadful
prospect
have
I
now
before
me
,
in
the
hands
of
a
woman
that
seems
to
delight
in
filthiness
!
  
<EOS>
O
dear
sirs
!
<EOS>
what
shall
I
do
!
 
<EOS>
What
shall
I
do
!
 
<EOS>
Surely
,
I
shall
never
be
equal
to
all
these
things
!
  
<EOS>
About
eight
at
night
,
we
entered
the
court
-
yard
of
this
handsome
,
large
,
old
,
and
lonely
mansion
,
that
looks
made
for
solitude
and
mischief
,
as
I
thought
,
by
its
appearance
,
with
all
its
brown
nodding
horrors
of
lofty
elms
and
pines
about
it
:
and
here
,
said
I
to
myself
<EOS>
,
I
fear
,
is
to
be
the
scene
of
my
ruin
,
unless
God
protect
me
,
who
is
all
-
sufficient
!
  
<EOS>
I
was
very
sick
at
entering
it
,
partly
from
fatigue
,
and
partly
from
dejection
of
spirits
:
and
Mrs.
Jewkes
got
me
some
mulled
wine
,
and
seemed
mighty
officious
to
welcome
me
thither
;
and
while
she
was
absent
,
ordering
the
wine
,
the
wicked
Robin
came
in
to
me
,
and
said
,
I
beg
a
thousand
pardons
for
my
part
in
this
affair
,
since
I
see
your
grief
and
your
distress
;
and
I
do
assure
you
,
that
I
am
sorry
it
fell
to
my
task
.
  
<EOS>
Mighty
well
,
Mr.
Robert
!
said
I
;
<EOS>
I
never
saw
an
execution
but
once
,
and
then
the
hangman
asked
the
poor
creature
's
pardon
,
and
wiped
his
mouth
,
as
you
do
,
and
pleaded
his
duty
,
and
then
calmly
tucked
up
the
criminal
.
<EOS>
But
I
am
no
criminal
,
as
you
all
know
:
<EOS>
And
if
I
could
have
thought
it
my
duty
to
obey
a
wicked
master
in
his
unlawful
command
,
I
had
saved
you
all
the
merit
of
this
vile
service
.
  
<EOS>
I
am
sorry
,
said
he
,
you
take
it
so
:
but
every
body
do
n't
think
alike
.
<EOS>
Well
,
said
I
,
you
have
done
your
part
,
Mr.
Robert
,
towards
my
ruin
,
very
faithfully
;
and
will
have
cause
to
be
sorry
<EOS>
,
may
be
,
at
the
long
run
,
when
you
shall
see
the
mischief
that
comes
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
Your
eyes
were
open
,
and
you
knew
I
was
to
be
carried
to
my
father
's
,
and
that
I
was
barbarously
tricked
and
betrayed
;
and
I
can
only
,
once
more
,
thank
you
for
your
part
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
God
forgive
you
!
  
<EOS>
So
he
went
away
a
little
sad
.
 
<EOS>
What
have
you
said
to
Robin
,
madam
?
<EOS>
said
Mrs.
Jewkes
:
(
who
came
in
as
he
went
out
:
)
<EOS>
the
poor
fellow
's
ready
to
cry
.
 
<EOS>
I
need
not
be
afraid
of
your
following
his
example
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
said
I
:
I
have
been
telling
him
,
that
he
has
done
his
part
to
my
ruin
:
and
he
now
ca
n't
help
it
!
 
<EOS>
So
his
repentance
does
me
<EOS>
no
good
<EOS>
;
I
wish
it
may
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
assure
you
,
madam
,
said
she
,
I
should
be
as
ready
to
cry
as
he
,
if
I
should
do
you
any
harm
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
not
in
his
power
to
help
it
now
,
said
I
;
but
your
part
is
to
come
,
and
you
may
choose
whether
you
'll
contribute
to
my
ruin
or
not
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
look
ye
,
madam
,
said
she
,
I
have
a
great
notion
of
doing
my
duty
to
my
master
;
and
therefore
you
may
depend
upon
it
,
if
I
can
do
that
,
and
serve
you
,
<EOS>
I
will
:
<EOS>
but
you
must
think
,
if
your
desire
,
and
his
will
,
come
to
clash
once
,
I
shall
do
as
he
bids
me
,
<EOS>
let
it
be
what
it
will
.
  
<EOS>
Pray
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
said
I
,
do
n't
madam
me
so
:
<EOS>
I
am
but
a
silly
poor
girl
,
set
up
by
the
gambol
of
fortune
,
for
a
May
-
game
;
and
now
am
to
be
something
,
and
now
nothing
,
just
as
that
thinks
fit
to
sport
with
me
:
<EOS>
And
let
you
and
me
talk
upon
a
foot
together
;
for
I
am
a
servant
inferior
to
you
,
and
so
much
the
more
,
as
I
am
turned
out
of
place
.
  
<EOS>
Ay
,
ay
,
says
she
,
I
understand
something
of
the
matter
;
you
have
so
great
power
over
my
master
,
that
you
may
soon
be
mistress
of
us
all
;
and
so
I
would
oblige
you
,
if
I
could
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
must
and
will
call
you
madam
;
for
I
am
instructed
to
shew
you
all
respect
<EOS>
,
I
'll
assure
you
.
  
<EOS>
Who
instructed
you
so
to
do
?
<EOS>
said
I.
 
Who
!
<EOS>
my
master
,
to
be
sure
,
said
she
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
said
I
,
how
can
that
be
?
 
<EOS>
You
have
not
seen
him
lately
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
that
's
true
,
said
she
;
but
I
have
been
expecting
you
here
some
time
;
(
O
the
deep
laid
wickedness
!
<EOS>
thought
I
:
)
and
,
besides
,
I
have
a
letter
of
instructions
by
Robin
;
but
,
may
be
,
I
should
not
have
said
so
much
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
would
shew
them
to
me
,
said
I
,
I
should
be
able
to
judge
how
far
I
could
,
or
could
not
,
expect
favour
from
you
,
consistent
with
your
duty
to
our
master
.
 
<EOS>
I
beg
your
pardon
,
fair
mistress
,
for
that
,
said
she
,
I
am
sufficiently
instructed
;
and
you
may
depend
upon
it
,
I
will
observe
my
orders
;
and
,
so
far
as
they
will
let
me
,
so
far
will
I
oblige
you
;
and
there
's
an
end
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
Well
,
said
I
,
you
will
not
,
I
hope
,
do
an
unlawful
or
wicked
thing
,
for
any
master
in
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
Look
ye
<EOS>
,
said
she
,
he
is
my
master
;
and
if
he
bids
me
do
any
thing
that
I
can
do
<EOS>
,
I
think
I
ought
to
do
it
;
and
let
him
,
who
has
his
power
to
command
me
,
look
to
the
lawfulness
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
said
I
,
suppose
he
should
bid
you
cut
my
throat
,
Would
you
do
it
?
<EOS>
There
's
no
danger
of
that
,
said
she
;
but
to
be
sure
I
would
not
;
for
then
I
should
be
hanged
!
<EOS>
for
that
would
be
murder
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
said
I
,
and
suppose
he
should
resolve
to
ensnare
a
poor
young
creature
,
and
ruin
her
,
would
you
assist
him
in
that
?
 
<EOS>
For
to
rob
a
person
of
her
virtue
is
worse
than
cutting
her
throat
.
  
<EOS>
Why
now
,
says
she
,
how
strangely
you
talk
!
 
<EOS>
Are
not
the
two
sexes
made
for
one
another
?
 
<EOS>
And
is
it
not
natural
for
a
gentleman
to
love
a
pretty
woman
?
 
<EOS>
And
suppose
he
can
obtain
his
desires
,
is
that
so
bad
as
cutting
her
throat
?
 
<EOS>
And
then
the
wretch
fell
a
laughing
,
and
talked
most
impertinently
,
and
shewed
me
,
that
I
had
nothing
to
expect
from
her
virtue
or
conscience
:
and
this
gave
me
great
mortification
;
for
I
was
in
hopes
of
working
upon
her
by
degrees
.
  
<EOS>
So
we
ended
our
discourse
here
,
and
I
bid
her
shew
me
where
I
must
lie
.
  
<EOS>
Why
,
said
she
,
lie
where
you
list
,
<EOS>
madam
<EOS>
;
I
can
tell
you
,
I
must
lie
with
you
for
the
present
.
 
<EOS>
For
the
present
!
<EOS>
said
I
,
and
torture
then
wrung
my
heart
!
 
<EOS>
But
is
it
in
your
instructions
,
that
you
must
lie
with
me
?
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
indeed
,
said
she
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
sorry
for
it
,
said
I.
 
Why
,
said
she
,
I
am
wholesome
,
and
cleanly
too
,
I
'll
assure
you
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
said
I
,
<EOS>
I
do
n't
doubt
that
;
but
I
love
to
lie
by
myself
.
 
<EOS>
How
so
?
<EOS>
said
she
;
<EOS>
Was
not
Mrs.
Jervis
<EOS>
your
bed
-
fellow
at
t'other
house
?
  
<EOS>
Well
,
said
I
,
quite
sick
of
her
,
and
my
condition
;
you
must
do
as
you
are
instructed
,
I
think
.
 
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
help
myself
,
and
am
a
most
miserable
creature
.
 
<EOS>
She
repeated
her
insufferable
nonsense
.
 
<EOS>
Mighty
miserable
,
indeed
,
to
be
so
well
beloved
by
one
of
the
finest
gentlemen
in
England
!
  
<EOS>
I
am
now
come
down
in
my
writing
to
this
present
SATURDAY
,
and
a
deal
I
have
written
.
  
<EOS>
My
wicked
bed
-
fellow
has
very
punctual
orders
,
it
seems
;
for
she
locks
me
and
herself
in
,
and
ties
the
two
keys
<EOS>
(
for
there
is
a
double
door
to
the
room
)
about
her
wrist
,
when
she
goes
to
bed
.
 
<EOS>
She
talks
of
the
house
having
been
attempted
to
be
broken
open
two
or
three
times
;
whether
to
fright
me
,
I
ca
n't
tell
;
but
it
makes
me
fearful
;
though
not
so
much
as
I
should
be
,
if
I
had
not
other
and
greater
fears
.
  
<EOS>
I
slept
but
<EOS>
little
last
night
,
and
got
up
,
and
pretended
to
sit
by
the
window
,
which
looks
into
the
spacious
gardens
;
but
I
was
writing
all
the
time
,
from
break
of
day
,
to
her
getting
up
,
and
after
,
when
she
was
absent
.
  
<EOS>
At
breakfast
she
presented
the
two
maids
to
me
,
the
cook
and
house
-
maid
,
poor
awkward
souls
,
that
I
can
see
no
hopes
of
,
they
seem
so
devoted
to
her
and
ignorance
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
I
am
resolved
,
if
possible
,
to
find
some
way
to
escape
,
before
this
wicked
master
comes
.
  
<EOS>
There
are
,
besides
,
of
servants
,
the
coachman
,
Robert
,
a
groom
,
a
helper
,
a
footman
;
all
but
Robert
,
(
and
he
is
accessary
to
my
ruin
,
)
<EOS>
strange
creatures
,
that
promise
nothing
;
and
all
likewise
devoted
to
this
woman
.
<EOS>
The
gardener
looks
like
a
good
honest
man
;
but
he
is
kept
at
a
distance
,
and
seems
reserved
.
  
<EOS>
I
wondered
I
saw
not
Mr.
Williams
the
clergyman
,
but
would
not
ask
after
him
,
apprehending
it
might
give
some
jealousy
;
but
when
I
had
beheld
the
rest
,
he
was
the
only
one
I
had
hopes
of
;
for
I
thought
his
cloth
would
set
him
above
assisting
in
my
ruin
.
 
<EOS>
But
in
the
afternoon
he
came
;
<EOS>
for
it
seems
he
has
a
little
Latin
school
in
the
neighbouring
village
,
which
he
attends
;
and
this
brings
him
in
a
little
matter
,
additional
to
my
master
's
favour
,
till
something
better
falls
,
of
which
he
has
hopes
.
  
<EOS>
He
is
a
sensible
sober
young
gentleman
;
and
when
I
saw
him
I
confirmed
myself
in
my
hopes
of
him
;
for
he
seemed
to
take
great
notice
of
my
distress
and
grief
;
(
for
I
could
not
hide
it
;
)
though
he
appeared
fearful
of
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
who
watched
all
our
motions
and
words
.
  
<EOS>
He
has
an
apartment
in
the
house
;
but
is
mostly
at
a
lodging
in
the
town
,
for
a
conveniency
of
his
little
school
;
only
on
Saturday
afternoon
and
Sundays
:
and
he
preaches
sometimes
for
the
minister
of
the
village
,
which
is
about
three
miles
off
.
  
<EOS>
I
hope
to
go
to
church
with
him
to
-
morrow
:
<EOS>
Sure
it
is
not
in
her
instructions
to
deny
me
!
 
<EOS>
He
ca
n't
have
thought
of
every
thing
!
 
<EOS>
And
something
may
strike
out
for
me
there
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
asked
her
,
for
a
feint
,
(
because
she
sha
n't
think
I
am
so
well
provided
,
)
to
indulge
me
with
pen
and
ink
,
though
I
have
been
using
my
own
so
freely
when
her
absence
would
let
me
;
for
I
begged
to
be
left
to
myself
as
much
as
possible
.
 
<EOS>
She
says
she
will
let
me
have
it
;
but
then
I
must
promise
not
to
send
any
writing
out
of
the
house
,
without
her
seeing
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
said
,
it
was
only
to
divert
my
grief
when
I
was
by
myself
,
as
I
desired
to
be
;
for
I
loved
writing
as
well
as
reading
;
<EOS>
but
I
had
nobody
to
send
to
<EOS>
,
she
knew
well
enough
.
  
<EOS>
No
,
not
at
present
,
may
be
,
said
she
;
but
I
am
told
you
are
a
great
writer
;
and
it
is
in
my
instructions
to
see
all
you
write
:
<EOS>
So
,
look
you
here
,
said
she
,
I
will
let
you
have
a
pen
and
ink
,
and
two
sheets
of
paper
:
for
this
employment
will
keep
you
out
of
worse
thoughts
:
but
I
must
see
them
always
when
I
ask
,
written
or
not
written
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
very
hard
,
said
I
;
but
may
I
not
have
to
myself
the
closet
in
the
room
where
we
lie
,
with
the
key
to
lock
up
my
things
?
 
<EOS>
I
believe
I
may
consent
to
that
,
said
she
;
and
I
will
set
it
in
order
for
you
,
and
leave
the
key
in
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
And
there
is
a
spinnet
too
,
said
she
;
if
it
be
in
tune
,
you
may
play
to
divert
you
now
and
then
;
for
I
know
my
old
lady
learnt
you
:
<EOS>
And
below
is
my
master
's
library
<EOS>
:
you
may
take
out
what
books
you
will
.
  
<EOS>
And
,
indeed
,
these
and
my
writing
will
be
all
my
amusement
<EOS>
:
for
I
have
no
work
given
me
to
do
;
and
the
spinnet
,
if
in
tune
,
will
not
find
my
mind
,
I
am
sure
,
in
tune
to
play
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
went
directly
and
picked
out
some
books
from
the
library
,
with
which
I
filled
a
shelf
in
the
closet
<EOS>
she
gave
me
possession
of
;
and
from
these
I
hope
to
receive
improvement
,
as
well
as
amusement
.
 
<EOS>
But
no
sooner
was
her
back
turned
,
than
I
set
about
hiding
a
pen
of
my
own
here
,
and
another
there
,
<EOS>
for
fear
I
should
come
to
be
denied
,
and
a
little
of
my
ink
in
a
broken
China
cup
,
and
a
little
in
another
cup
;
and
a
sheet
of
paper
here
and
there
among
my
linen
,
with
a
little
of
the
wax
,
and
a
few
wafers
,
in
several
places
,
lest
I
should
be
searched
;
and
something
,
I
thought
,
might
happen
to
open
a
way
for
my
deliverance
,
by
these
or
some
other
means
.
 
<EOS>
O
the
pride
,
thought
<EOS>
I
<EOS>
,
I
shall
have
,
if
I
can
secure
my
innocence
,
and
escape
the
artful
wiles
of
this
wicked
master
!
 
<EOS>
For
,
if
he
comes
hither
,
I
am
undone
,
to
be
sure
!
 
<EOS>
For
this
naughty
woman
will
assist
him
,
rather
than
fail
,
in
the
worst
of
his
attempts
;
and
he
'll
have
no
occasion
to
send
her
out
of
the
way
,
as
he
would
have
done
Mrs.
Jervis
once
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
must
set
all
my
little
wits
at
work
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
a
grief
to
me
to
write
,
and
not
to
be
able
to
send
to
you
what
I
write
:
<EOS>
but
now
it
is
all
the
diversion
I
have
,
and
if
God
will
favour
my
escape
with
my
innocence
,
as
I
trust
he
graciously
will
,
for
all
these
black
prospects
,
with
what
pleasure
shall
I
read
them
afterwards
!
  
<EOS>
I
was
going
to
say
,
Pray
for
your
dutiful
daughter
,
as
I
used
;
but
,
alas
!
<EOS>
you
can
not
know
my
distress
,
though
I
am
sure
I
have
your
prayers
:
<EOS>
And
I
will
write
on
as
things
happen
,
that
if
a
way
should
open
,
my
scribble
may
be
ready
to
be
sent
<EOS>
:
For
what
I
do
,
must
be
at
a
jerk
,
to
be
sure
.
  
<EOS>
O
how
I
want
such
an
obliging
honest
-
hearted
man
as
John
!
  
<EOS>
I
am
now
come
to
SUNDAY
.
  
<EOS>
Well
,
here
is
a
sad
thing
!
 
<EOS>
I
am
denied
by
this
barbarous
woman
to
go
to
church
,
as
I
had
built
upon
I
<EOS>
might
:
<EOS>
and
she
has
huffed
poor
Mr.
Williams
all
to
pieces
,
for
pleading
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
find
he
is
to
be
forbid
the
house
,
if
she
pleases
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
gentleman
!
<EOS>
all
his
dependance
is
upon
my
master
,
who
has
a
very
good
living
for
him
,
if
the
incumbent
die
;
and
he
has
kept
his
bed
these
four
months
,
of
old
age
and
dropsy
.
  
<EOS>
He
pays
me
great
respect
,
and
I
see
pities
me
;
and
would
,
perhaps
,
assist
my
escape
from
these
dangers
:
<EOS>
But
I
have
nobody
to
plead
for
me
;
and
why
should
I
wish
to
ruin
a
poor
gentleman
,
by
engaging
him
against
his
interest
?
 
<EOS>
Yet
one
would
do
any
thing
to
preserve
one
's
innocence
;
and
Providence
would
,
perhaps
,
make
it
up
to
him
!
  
<EOS>
O
judge
<EOS>
(
but
how
shall
you
see
what
I
write
!
)
<EOS>
of
my
distracted
condition
,
to
be
reduced
to
such
a
pass
as
to
a
desire
to
lay
traps
for
mankind
!
<EOS>
But
he
wants
sadly
to
say
something
to
me
,
as
he
whisperingly
hinted
.
  
<EOS>
The
wretch
(
I
think
I
will
always
call
her
the
wretch
henceforth
)
abuses
me
more
and
more
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
but
talking
to
one
of
the
maids
just
now
,
indeed
a
little
to
tamper
with
her
by
degrees
:
<EOS>
and
she
popt
upon
us
,
and
said
 
Nay
,
madam
,
do
n't
offer
to
tempt
poor
innocent
country
maidens
from
doing
their
duty
.
 
<EOS>
You
wanted
<EOS>
,
I
hear
,
she
should
take
a
walk
with
you
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
charge
you
,
Nan
,
never
stir
with
her
,
nor
obey
her
,
without
letting
me
know
it
,
in
the
smallest
trifles
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
,
walk
with
you
!
<EOS>
and
where
would
you
go
,
I
tro
'
?
 
<EOS>
Why
,
barbarous
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
said
I
,
only
to
look
a
little
up
the
elm
-
walk
,
since
you
would
not
let
me
go
to
church
.
  
<EOS>
Nan
,
said
she
,
to
shew
me
how
much
they
were
all
in
her
power
,
pull
off
madam
's
shoes
,
and
bring
them
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
taken
care
of
her
others
.
  
<EOS>
Indeed
she
sha
n't
,
said
I.
 
Nay
,
said
Nan
,
but
I
must
if
my
mistress
bids
me
:
so
pray
,
madam
,
do
n't
hinder
me
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
indeed
(
would
you
believe
it
?
)
<EOS>
she
took
my
shoes
off
,
and
left
me
barefoot
:
and
,
for
my
share
,
I
have
been
so
frighted
at
this
,
that
I
have
not
power
even
to
relieve
my
mind
by
my
tears
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
quite
stupefied
to
be
sure
!
 
<EOS>
Here
I
was
forced
to
leave
off
.
  
<EOS>
Now
I
will
give
you
a
picture
of
this
wretch
:
She
is
a
broad
,
squat
,
pursy
,
fat
thing
,
quite
ugly
,
if
any
thing
human
can
be
so
called
;
about
forty
years
old
.
 
<EOS>
She
has
a
huge
hand
,
and
an
arm
as
thick
as
my
waist
,
I
believe
.
 
<EOS>
Her
nose
is
flat
and
crooked
,
and
her
brows
grow
down
over
her
eyes
;
a
dead
spiteful
,
grey
,
goggling
eye
,
to
be
sure
she
has
.
 
<EOS>
And
her
face
is
flat
and
broad
;
and
as
to
colour
,
looks
like
as
if
it
had
been
pickled
a
month
in
saltpetre
:
<EOS>
I
dare
say
she
drinks
:
 
<EOS>
She
has
a
hoarse
,
man
-
like
voice
,
and
is
as
thick
as
she
is
long
;
and
yet
looks
so
deadly
strong
,
that
I
am
afraid
she
would
dash
me
at
her
foot
in
an
instant
,
if
I
was
to
vex
her
.
 
<EOS>
So
that
with
a
heart
more
ugly
than
her
face
,
she
frightens
me
sadly
:
and
I
am
undone
to
be
sure
,
if
God
does
not
protect
me
;
for
she
is
very
,
very
wicked
 
<EOS>
indeed
she
is
.
  
<EOS>
This
is
poor
helpless
spite
in
me
:
 
<EOS>
But
the
picture
is
too
near
the
truth
notwithstanding
.
 
<EOS>
She
sends
me
a
message
just
now
,
that
I
shall
have
my
shoes
again
,
if
I
will
accept
of
her
company
to
walk
with
me
in
the
garden
.
 
<EOS>
To
waddle
with
me
,
rather
,
thought
I.
  
<EOS>
Well
,
'
tis
not
my
business
to
quarrel
with
her
downright
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
be
watched
the
narrower
,
if
I
do
;
and
so
I
will
go
with
the
hated
wretch
.
 
<EOS>
O
for
my
dear
Mrs.
Jervis
!
<EOS>
or
,
rather
,
to
be
safe
with
my
dear
father
and
mother
.
  
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
I
am
out
of
my
wits
for
joy
!
 
<EOS>
Just
as
I
have
got
my
shoes
on
,
I
am
told
John
,
honest
John
,
is
come
on
horseback
!
 
<EOS>
A
blessing
on
his
faithful
heart
!
 
<EOS>
What
joy
is
this
!
 
<EOS>
But
I
'll
tell
you
more
by
and
by
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
not
let
her
know
<EOS>
I
am
so
glad
to
see
this
dear
blessed
John
,
to
be
sure
!
  
<EOS>
Alas
!
<EOS>
but
he
looks
sad
,
as
I
see
him
out
of
the
window
!
 
<EOS>
What
can
be
the
matter
!
 
<EOS>
I
hope
my
dear
parents
are
well
,
and
Mrs.
Jervis
,
and
Mr.
Longman
,
and
every
body
,
my
naughty
master
not
excepted
;
 
<EOS>
for
I
wish
him
to
live
and
repent
of
all
his
wickedness
to
poor
me
.
  
<EOS>
O
dear
heart
!
<EOS>
what
a
world
do
we
live
in
!
 
<EOS>
I
am
now
come
to
take
up
my
pen
again
:
<EOS>
But
I
am
in
a
sad
taking
truly
!
 
<EOS>
Another
puzzling
trial
,
to
be
sure
.
  
<EOS>
Here
was
John
,
as
I
said
,
and
the
poor
man
came
to
me
,
with
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
who
whispered
,
that
I
would
say
nothing
about
the
shoes
,
for
my
own
sake
,
as
she
said
.
 
<EOS>
The
poor
man
saw
my
distress
,
by
my
red
eyes
,
and
my
hagged
looks
,
I
suppose
;
for
I
have
had
a
sad
time
of
it
<EOS>
,
you
must
needs
think
;
and
though
he
would
have
hid
it
,
if
he
could
,
yet
his
own
eyes
ran
over
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
Mrs.
Pamela
;
said
he
;
<EOS>
Oh
,
Mrs.
Pamela
!
 
<EOS>
Well
,
honest
fellow
-
servant
<EOS>
,
said
I
,
I
can
not
help
it
at
present
:
I
am
obliged
to
your
honesty
and
kindness
,
to
be
sure
;
and
then
he
wept
more
.
 
<EOS>
Said
I
,
(
for
my
heart
was
ready
to
break
to
see
his
grief
;
for
it
is
a
touching
thing
to
see
a
man
cry
)
,
Tell
me
the
worst
!
 
<EOS>
Is
my
master
coming
?
 
<EOS>
No
,
no
,
said
he
,
and
sobbed
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
said
I
,
is
there
any
news
of
my
poor
father
and
mother
?
<EOS>
How
do
they
do
?
 
<EOS>
I
hope
well
,
said
he
,
I
know
nothing
to
the
contrary
.
<EOS>
There
is
no
mishap
,
I
hope
,
to
Mrs.
Jervis
or
to
Mr.
Longman
,
or
my
fellow
-
servants
!
 
<EOS>
No
 
said
he
,
poor
man
!
<EOS>
with
a
long
No
,
as
if
his
heart
would
burst
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
thank
God
then
!
<EOS>
said
I.
  
<EOS>
The
man
's
a
fool
,
said
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
I
think
:
What
ado
is
here
!
 
<EOS>
Why
,
sure
thou'rt
in
love
,
John
.
 
<EOS>
Dost
thou
not
see
young
madam
is
well
?
 
<EOS>
What
ails
thee
,
man
?
 
<EOS>
Nothing
at
all
,
said
he
;
but
I
am
such
a
fool
as
to
cry
for
joy
to
see
good
Mrs.
Pamela
:
<EOS>
But
I
have
a
letter
for
you
.
  
<EOS>
I
took
it
,
and
saw
it
was
from
my
master
;
so
I
put
it
in
my
pocket
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
said
I
,
you
need
not
<EOS>
,
I
hope
,
see
this
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
no
,
said
she
,
I
see
whose
it
is
,
well
enough
;
or
else
,
may
be
<EOS>
,
I
must
have
insisted
on
reading
it
.
  
<EOS>
And
here
is
one
for
you
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
said
he
;
but
yours
,
said
he
to
me
,
requires
an
answer
,
which
I
must
carry
back
early
in
the
morning
,
or
to
-
night
,
if
I
can
.
  
<EOS>
You
have
no
more
,
John
,
said
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
for
Mrs.
Pamela
,
have
you
?
 
<EOS>
No
,
said
he
,
I
have
not
,
but
every
body
's
kind
love
and
service
.
 
<EOS>
Ay
,
to
us
both
,
to
be
sure
,
said
she
.
 
<EOS>
John
,
said
I
,
I
will
read
the
letter
,
and
pray
take
care
of
yourself
;
for
you
are
a
good
man
,
God
bless
you
!
<EOS>
and
I
rejoice
to
see
you
,
and
hear
from
you
all
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
longed
to
say
more
;
only
that
nasty
Mrs.
Jewkes
.
  
<EOS>
So
I
went
up
,
and
locked
myself
in
my
closet
,
and
opened
the
letter
;
and
this
is
a
copy
of
it
:
  
<EOS>
"
My
DEAREST
PAMELA
,
  
"
I
send
purposely
to
you
on
an
affair
that
concerns
you
very
much
,
and
me
somewhat
,
but
chiefly
for
your
sake
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
conscious
that
I
have
proceeded
by
you
in
such
a
manner
as
may
justly
alarm
your
fears
,
and
give
concern
to
your
honest
friends
:
and
all
my
pleasure
is
,
that
I
can
and
will
make
you
amends
for
the
disturbance
I
have
given
you
.
 
<EOS>
As
I
promised
,
I
sent
to
your
father
the
day
after
your
departure
,
that
he
might
not
be
too
much
concerned
for
you
,
and
assured
him
of
my
honour
to
you
;
and
made
an
excuse
,
such
an
one
as
ought
to
have
satisfied
him
,
for
your
not
coming
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
But
this
was
not
sufficient
,
it
seems
;
for
he
,
poor
man
!
<EOS>
came
to
me
next
morning
,
and
set
my
family
almost
in
an
uproar
about
you
.
  
<EOS>
"
O
my
dear
girl
!
<EOS>
what
trouble
has
not
your
obstinacy
given
me
,
and
yourself
too
!
 
<EOS>
I
had
no
way
to
pacify
him
,
but
to
promise
that
he
should
see
a
letter
written
from
you
to
Mrs.
Jervis
,
to
satisfy
him
you
are
well
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
all
my
care
in
this
case
is
for
your
aged
parents
,
lest
they
should
be
touched
with
too
fatal
a
grief
;
and
for
you
,
whose
duty
and
affection
for
them
<EOS>
I
know
to
be
so
strong
and
laudable
;
for
this
reason
I
beg
you
will
write
a
few
lines
to
them
,
and
let
me
prescribe
the
form
;
which
I
have
done
,
putting
myself
as
near
as
I
can
in
your
place
,
and
expressing
your
sense
,
with
a
warmth
that
I
doubt
will
have
too
much
possessed
you
.
  
<EOS>
"
After
what
is
done
,
and
which
can
not
now
be
helped
,
but
which
,
I
assure
you
,
shall
turn
out
honourably
for
you
,
I
expect
not
to
be
refused
;
because
I
can
not
possibly
have
any
view
in
it
,
but
to
satisfy
your
parents
;
which
is
more
your
concern
than
mine
;
and
so
I
must
beg
you
will
not
alter
one
tittle
of
the
underneath
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
do
,
it
will
be
impossible
for
me
to
send
it
,
or
that
it
should
answer
the
good
end
I
propose
by
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
promised
,
that
I
will
not
approach
you
without
your
leave
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
find
you
easy
,
and
not
attempting
to
dispute
or
avoid
your
present
lot
,
I
will
keep
to
my
word
,
although
it
is
a
difficulty
upon
me
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
shall
your
restraint
last
long
:
for
I
will
assure
you
,
that
I
am
resolved
very
soon
to
convince
you
of
my
good
intentions
,
and
with
what
ardour
<EOS>
I
am
                                                     
<EOS>
"
Yours
,
etc
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
letter
he
prescribed
for
me
was
as
this
:
  
"
DEAR
Mrs.
JERVIS
,
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
,
instead
of
being
driven
by
Robin
to
my
dear
father
's
,
been
carried
off
,
where
I
have
no
liberty
to
tell
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
at
present
,
I
am
not
used
hardly
;
and
I
write
to
beg
you
to
let
my
dear
father
and
mother
,
whose
hearts
must
be
well
nigh
broken
,
know
that
I
am
well
;
and
that
I
am
,
and
,
by
the
grace
of
God
,
ever
will
be
,
their
honest
,
as
well
as
dutiful
daughter
,
and
                   
"
Your
obliged
friend
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
neither
send
date
nor
place
;
but
have
most
solemn
assurances
of
honourable
usage
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
knew
not
what
to
do
on
this
most
strange
request
and
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
But
my
heart
bled
so
much
for
you
,
my
dear
father
,
who
had
taken
the
pains
to
go
yourself
,
and
inquire
after
your
poor
daughter
,
as
well
as
for
my
dear
mother
,
that
I
resolved
to
write
,
and
pretty
much
in
the
above
form
,
that
it
might
be
sent
to
pacify
you
,
till
I
could
let
you
,
somehow
or
other
,
know
the
true
state
of
the
matter
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
wrote
thus
to
my
strange
wicked
master
himself
:
  
"
SIR
,
  
"
If
you
knew
but
the
anguish
of
my
mind
,
and
how
much
I
suffer
by
your
dreadful
usage
of
me
,
you
would
surely
pity
me
,
and
consent
to
my
deliverance
.
 
<EOS>
What
have
I
done
,
that
I
should
be
the
only
mark
of
your
cruelty
?
 
<EOS>
I
can
have
no
hope
,
<EOS>
no
desire
of
living
left
me
,
because
I
can
not
have
the
least
dependence
,
after
what
has
passed
,
upon
your
solemn
assurances
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
impossible
they
should
be
consistent
with
the
dishonourable
methods
you
take
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nothing
but
your
promise
of
not
seeing
me
here
in
my
deplorable
bondage
,
can
give
me
the
least
ray
of
hope
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
,
I
beseech
you
,
drive
the
poor
distressed
Pamela
upon
a
rock
,
that
may
be
the
destruction
both
of
her
soul
and
body
!
 
<EOS>
You
do
n't
know
,
<EOS>
sir
,
how
dreadfully
I
dare
,
weak
as
I
am
of
mind
and
intellect
,
when
my
virtue
is
in
danger
.
 
<EOS>
And
,
O
!
<EOS>
hasten
my
deliverance
,
that
a
poor
unworthy
creature
,
below
the
notice
of
such
a
gentleman
as
you
,
may
not
be
made
the
sport
of
a
high
condition
,
for
no
reason
in
the
world
,
but
because
she
is
not
able
to
defend
herself
,
nor
has
a
friend
that
can
right
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
,
sir
,
in
part
to
shew
my
obedience
to
you
,
but
indeed
,
I
own
,
more
to
give
ease
to
the
minds
of
my
poor
distressed
parents
,
whose
poverty
,
one
would
think
,
should
screen
them
from
violences
of
this
sort
,
as
well
as
their
poor
daughter
,
followed
pretty
much
the
form
you
have
prescribed
for
me
,
in
the
letter
to
Mrs.
Jervis
;
and
the
alterations
I
have
made
(
for
I
could
not
help
a
few
)
are
of
such
a
nature
,
as
,
though
they
shew
my
concern
a
little
,
yet
must
answer
the
end
you
are
pleased
to
say
you
propose
by
this
letter
.
  
<EOS>
"
For
God
's
sake
,
good
sir
,
pity
my
lowly
condition
,
and
my
present
great
misery
;
and
let
me
join
with
all
the
rest
of
your
servants
to
bless
that
goodness
,
which
you
have
extended
to
every
one

the
poor
afflicted

broken

PAMELA

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
thought
,
when
I
had
written
this
letter
,
and
that
which
he
had
prescribed
,
it
would
look
like
placing
a
confidence
in
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
to
shew
them
to
her
;
and
I
shewed
her
,
at
the
same
time
,
my
master
's
letter
to
me
;
for
I
believed
the
value
he
expressed
for
me
,
would
give
me
credit
with
one
who
professed
in
every
thing
to
serve
him
,
right
or
wrong
;
though
I
had
so
little
reason
,
I
fear
,
to
pride
myself
in
it
:
and
I
was
not
mistaken
;
for
it
has
seemed
to
influence
her
not
a
little
,
and
she
is
at
present
mighty
obliging
,
and
runs
over
in
my
praises
;
but
is
the
less
to
be
minded
,
because
she
praises
as
much
the
author
of
my
miseries
,
and
his
honourable
intentions
,
as
she
calls
them
;
for
I
see
,
that
she
is
capable
of
thinking
,
as
I
fear
he
does
,
that
every
thing
that
makes
for
his
wicked
will
is
honourable
,
though
to
the
ruin
of
the
innocent
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
God
<EOS>
I
may
find
it
otherwise
!
 
<EOS>
Though
,
I
hope
,
whatever
the
wicked
gentleman
may
intend
,
that
I
shall
be
at
last
rid
of
her
impertinent
bold
way
of
talk
,
when
she
seems
to
think
,
from
his
letter
,
that
he
means
honourably
.
  
<EOS>
I
am
now
come
to
MONDAY
,
the
5th
Day
of
my
Bondage
and
Misery
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
in
hope
to
have
an
opportunity
to
see
John
,
and
have
a
little
private
talk
with
him
,
before
he
went
away
;
but
it
could
not
be
.
 
<EOS>
The
poor
man
's
excessive
sorrow
made
Mrs.
Jewkes
take
it
into
her
head
,
to
think
he
loved
me
;
and
so
she
brought
up
a
message
to
me
from
him
this
morning
that
he
was
going
.
 
<EOS>
I
desired
he
might
come
up
to
my
closet
,
as
I
called
it
,
and
she
came
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
The
honest
man
,
as
I
thought
him
,
was
as
full
of
concern
as
before
,
at
taking
leave
<EOS>
and
I
gave
him
two
letters
,
the
one
for
Mrs.
Jervis
,
enclosed
in
another
for
my
master
:
<EOS>
but
Mrs.
Jewkes
would
see
me
seal
them
up
,
lest
I
should
enclose
any
thing
else
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
surprised
,
at
the
man
's
going
away
,
to
see
him
drop
a
bit
of
paper
,
just
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
,
which
I
took
up
without
being
observed
by
Mrs.
Jewkes
:
<EOS>
but
I
was
a
thousand
times
more
surprised
,
when
I
returned
to
my
closet
,
and
opening
it
read
as
follows
:
  
<EOS>
"
GOOD
MRS
.
<EOS>
PAMELA
,
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
grieved
to
tell
you
how
much
you
have
been
deceived
and
betrayed
,
and
that
by
such
a
vile
dog
as
I.
 
Little
<EOS>
did
I
think
it
would
come
to
this
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
must
say
,
if
ever
there
was
a
rogue
in
the
world
,
it
is
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
all
along
shewed
your
letters
to
my
master
:
<EOS>
He
employed
me
for
that
purpose
;
and
he
saw
every
one
,
before
I
carried
them
to
your
father
and
mother
;
and
then
scaled
them
up
,
and
sent
me
with
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
some
business
that
way
,
but
not
half
so
often
as
I
pretended
:
<EOS>
and
as
soon
as
I
heard
how
it
was
,
I
was
ready
to
hang
myself
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
well
think
I
could
not
stand
in
your
presence
.
 
<EOS>
O
vile
,
vile
wretch
,
to
bring
you
to
this
!
<EOS>
If
you
are
ruined
,
I
am
the
rogue
that
caused
it
.
 
<EOS>
All
the
justice
I
can
do
you
,
is
to
tell
you
,
you
are
in
vile
hands
;
and
I
am
afraid
will
be
undone
in
spite
of
all
your
sweet
innocence
;
and
I
believe
I
shall
never
live
,
after
I
know
it
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
can
forgive
me
,
you
are
exceeding
good
;
but
I
shall
never
forgive
myself
<EOS>
,
that
's
certain
.
 
<EOS>
Howsomever
,
it
will
do
you
no
good
to
make
this
known
;
and
may
-
hap
<EOS>
I
may
live
to
do
you
service
.
<EOS>
If
I
can
,
I
will
:
<EOS>
I
am
sure
I
ought
.
 
<EOS>
Master
kept
your
last
two
or
three
letters
,
and
did
not
send
them
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
the
most
abandoned
wretch
of
wretches
.

J.
ARNOLD

You
see
your
undoing
has
been
long
hatching
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
take
care
of
your
sweet
self
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
is
a
devil
:
but
in
my
master
's
t'other
house
you
have
not
one
false
heart
,
but
myself
.
 
<EOS>
Out
upon
me
for
a
villain
!
"
  
<EOS>
My
dear
father
and
mother
,
when
you
come
to
this
place
,
I
make
no
doubt
your
hair
will
stand
on
end
as
mine
does
!
 
<EOS>
O
the
deceitfulness
of
the
heart
of
man
!
 
<EOS>
This
John
,
that
I
took
to
be
the
honestest
of
men
;
that
you
took
for
the
same
;
that
was
always
praising
you
to
me
,
and
me
to
you
,
and
for
nothing
so
much
as
for
our
honest
hearts
;
this
very
fellow
was
all
the
while
a
vile
hypocrite
,
and
a
perfidious
wretch
,
and
helping
to
carry
on
my
ruin
.
  
<EOS>
But
he
says
so
much
of
himself
,
that
I
will
only
sit
down
with
this
sad
reflection
,
<EOS>
That
power
and
riches
never
want
tools
to
promote
their
vilest
ends
,
and
there
is
nothing
so
hard
to
be
known
as
the
heart
of
man
:
 
<EOS>
I
can
<EOS>
but
pity
the
poor
wretch
,
since
he
seems
to
have
great
remorse
,
and
I
believe
it
best
to
keep
his
wickedness
secret
.
 
<EOS>
If
it
lies
in
my
way
,
I
will
encourage
his
penitence
;
for
I
may
possibly
make
some
discoveries
by
it
.
  
<EOS>
One
thing
I
should
mention
in
this
place
;
he
brought
down
,
in
a
portmanteau
,
all
the
clothes
and
things
<EOS>
my
lady
and
master
had
given
me
,
and
moreover
two
velvet
hoods
,
and
a
velvet
scarf
,
that
used
to
be
worn
by
my
lady
;
but
I
have
no
comfort
in
them
,
or
any
thing
else
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
had
the
portmanteau
brought
into
my
closet
,
and
she
shewed
me
what
was
in
it
;
but
then
locked
it
up
,
and
said
,
she
would
let
me
have
what
I
would
out
of
it
,
when
I
asked
;
but
if
I
had
the
key
,
it
might
make
me
want
to
go
abroad
,
may
be
;
and
so
the
confident
woman
put
it
in
her
pocket
.
  
<EOS>
I
gave
myself
over
to
sad
reflections
upon
this
strange
and
surprising
discovery
of
John
's
,
and
wept
much
for
him
,
and
for
myself
too
;
for
now
I
see
,
as
he
says
,
my
ruin
has
been
long
hatching
,
that
I
can
make
no
doubt
what
my
master
's
honourable
professions
will
end
in
.
 
<EOS>
What
a
heap
of
hard
names
does
the
poor
fellow
call
himself
!
 
<EOS>
But
what
must
they
deserve
,
then
,
who
set
him
to
work
?
 
<EOS>
O
what
has
this
wicked
master
to
answer
for
,
to
be
so
corrupt
himself
,
and
to
corrupt
others
,
who
would
have
been
all
innocent
;
and
to
carry
on
a
poor
plot
,
I
am
sure
for
a
gentleman
,
to
ruin
a
poor
creature
,
who
never
did
him
harm
,
nor
wished
him
any
;
and
who
can
still
pray
for
his
happiness
,
and
his
repentance
?
  
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
but
wonder
what
these
gentlemen
,
as
they
are
called
,
can
think
of
themselves
for
these
vile
doings
!
 
<EOS>
John
had
some
inducement
;
for
he
hoped
to
please
his
master
,
who
rewarded
him
and
was
bountiful
to
him
;
and
the
same
may
be
said
,
bad
as
she
is
,
for
this
same
odious
Mrs.
Jewkes
.
 
<EOS>
But
what
inducement
has
my
master
for
taking
so
much
pains
to
do
the
devil
's
work
for
him
?
 
<EOS>
If
he
loves
me
,
as
'
tis
falsely
called
,
must
he
therefore
lay
traps
for
me
,
to
ruin
me
and
make
me
as
bad
as
himself
?
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
imagine
what
good
the
undoing
of
such
a
poor
creature
as
I
can
procure
him
.
 
<EOS>
To
be
sure
,
I
am
a
very
worthless
body
.
 
<EOS>
People
,
indeed
,
say
I
am
handsome
;
but
if
I
was
so
,
should
not
a
gentleman
prefer
an
honest
servant
to
a
guilty
harlot
?
 
<EOS>
And
must
he
be
more
earnest
to
seduce
me
,
because
I
dread
of
all
things
to
be
seduced
,
and
would
rather
lose
my
life
than
my
honesty
?
  
<EOS>
Well
,
these
are
strange
things
to
me
!
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
account
for
them
,
for
my
share
;
but
sure
nobody
will
say
,
that
these
fine
gentlemen
have
any
tempter
but
their
own
wicked
wills
!
 
<EOS>
his
naughty
master
could
run
away
from
me
,
when
he
apprehended
his
servants
might
discover
his
vile
attempts
upon
me
in
that
sad
closet
affair
;
but
is
it
not
strange
that
he
should
not
be
afraid
of
the
all
-
seeing
eye
,
from
which
even
that
base
plotting
heart
of
his
,
in
its
most
secret
motions
,
could
not
be
hid
?
 
<EOS>
But
what
avail
me
<EOS>
these
sorrowful
reflections
?
 
<EOS>
He
is
and
will
be
wicked
,
and
designs
me
a
victim
to
his
lawless
attempts
,
if
the
God
in
whom
I
trust
,
and
to
whom
I
hourly
pray
,
prevent
it
not
.
  
<EOS>
Tuesday
and
Wednesday
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
been
hindered
by
this
wicked
woman
's
watching
me
so
close
,
from
writing
on
Tuesday
;
and
so
I
will
put
both
these
days
together
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
a
little
turn
with
her
for
an
airing
,
in
the
chariot
,
and
walked
several
times
in
the
garden
;
but
have
always
her
at
my
heels
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Williams
came
to
see
us
,
and
took
a
walk
with
us
once
;
and
while
her
back
was
just
turned
,
(
encouraged
by
the
hint
he
had
before
given
me
,
)
<EOS>
I
said
,
Sir
,
I
see
two
tiles
upon
that
parsley
-
bed
;
might
not
one
cover
them
with
mould
,
with
a
note
between
them
,
on
occasion
?
 
<EOS>
A
good
hint
,
said
he
;
let
that
sunflower
by
the
back
-
door
of
the
garden
be
the
place
;
I
have
a
key
to
the
door
;
for
it
is
my
nearest
way
to
the
town
.
  
<EOS>
So
I
was
forced
to
begin
.
 
<EOS>
O
what
inventions
will
necessity
push
us
upon
!
<EOS>
I
hugged
myself
at
the
thought
;
and
she
coming
to
us
,
he
said
,
as
if
he
was
continuing
a
discourse
we
were
in
:
No
,
not
extraordinary
pleasant
.
<EOS>
What
's
that
?
<EOS>
what
's
that
?
<EOS>
said
Mrs.
Jewkes
.
 
<EOS>
Only
,
said
he
,
the
town
,
I
'm
saying
,
is
not
very
pleasant
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
indeed
,
said
she
,
it
is
not
;
it
is
a
poor
town
,
to
my
thinking
.
 
<EOS>
Are
there
any
gentry
in
it
?
<EOS>
said
I.
 
<EOS>
And
so
we
chatted
on
about
the
town
,
to
deceive
her
.
 
<EOS>
But
my
deceit
intended
no
hurt
to
any
body
.
  
<EOS>
We
then
talked
of
the
garden
,
how
large
and
pleasant
,
and
the
like
;
and
sat
down
on
the
tufted
slope
of
the
fine
fish
-
pond
,
to
see
the
fishes
play
upon
the
surface
of
the
water
;
and
she
said
,
I
should
angle
if
I
would
.
  
<EOS>
I
wish
,
said
I
,
you
'd
be
so
kind
to
fetch
me
a
rod
and
baits
.
 
<EOS>
Pretty
mistress
!
<EOS>
said
she
 
<EOS>
I
know
better
than
that
<EOS>
,
I
'll
assure
you
,
at
this
time
.
 
<EOS>
I
mean
no
harm
,
said
I
,
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
Let
me
tell
you
,
said
she
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
none
who
have
their
thoughts
more
about
them
than
you
.
 
<EOS>
A
body
ought
to
look
to
it
where
you
are
.
 
<EOS>
But
we
'll
angle
a
little
to
-
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Williams
,
who
is
much
afraid
of
her
,
turned
the
discourse
to
a
general
subject
.
 
<EOS>
I
sauntered
in
,
and
left
them
to
talk
by
themselves
;
but
he
went
away
to
town
,
and
she
was
soon
after
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
had
got
to
my
pen
and
ink
;
and
I
said
,
I
want
some
paper
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
(
putting
what
I
was
about
in
my
bosom
:
)
<EOS>
You
know
I
have
written
two
letters
,
and
sent
them
by
John
.
 
<EOS>
(
O
how
his
name
,
poor
guilty
fellow
,
grieves
me
!
)
 
<EOS>
Well
,
said
she
<EOS>
,
you
have
some
left
;
one
sheet
did
for
those
two
letters
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
said
I
;
but
I
used
half
another
for
a
cover
,
you
know
;
and
see
how
I
have
scribbled
the
other
half
;
and
so
I
shewed
her
a
parcel
of
broken
scraps
of
verses
,
which
I
had
tried
to
recollect
,
and
had
written
purposely
that
she
might
see
,
and
think
me
usually
employed
to
such
idle
purposes
.
 
<EOS>
Ay
,
said
she
,
<EOS>
so
you
have
;
well
,
I
'll
give
you
two
sheets
more
;
but
let
me
see
how
you
dispose
of
them
,
either
written
or
blank
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
thought
I
<EOS>
,
I
hope
still
,
Argus
,
to
be
too
hard
for
thee
.
<EOS>
Now
Argus
,
the
poets
say
,
had
a
hundred
eyes
,
and
was
set
to
watch
with
them
all
,
as
she
does
.
  
<EOS>
She
brought
me
the
paper
,
and
said
,
Now
,
<EOS>
madam
,
let
me
see
you
write
something
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
,
said
I
;
and
took
the
pen
and
wrote
,
"
I
wish
Mrs.
Jewkes
would
be
so
good
to
me
,
as
I
would
be
to
her
,
if
I
had
it
in
my
power
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
That
's
pretty
now
,
said
she
;
<EOS>
well
,
I
hope
I
am
;
but
what
then
?
<EOS>
"
Why
then
(
wrote
I
)
<EOS>
she
would
do
me
the
favour
to
let
me
know
,
what
I
have
done
to
be
made
her
prisoner
;
and
what
she
thinks
is
to
become
of
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
Well
,
and
what
then
?
said
she
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
then
,
of
consequence
,
(
scribbled
I
,
)
<EOS>
she
would
let
me
see
her
instructions
,
that
I
may
know
how
far
to
blame
,
or
to
acquit
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
Thus
I
fooled
on
,
to
shew
her
my
fondness
for
scribbling
;
for
I
had
no
expectation
of
any
good
from
her
;
that
so
she
might
suppose
I
employed
myself
,
as
I
said
,
to
no
better
purpose
at
other
times
:
for
she
will
have
it
,
that
I
am
upon
some
plot
,
I
am
so
silent
,
and
love
so
much
to
be
by
myself
.
 
<EOS>
She
would
have
made
me
write
on
a
little
further
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
said
I
;
you
have
not
answered
me
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
said
she
,
what
can
you
doubt
,
when
my
master
himself
assures
you
of
his
honour
?
 
<EOS>
Ay
,
said
I
;
but
lay
your
hand
to
your
heart
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
and
tell
me
,
if
you
yourself
believe
him
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
said
she
,
to
be
sure
I
do
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
said
I
,
what
do
you
call
honour
?
<EOS>
Why
,
said
she
,
what
does
he
call
honour
,
think
you
?
 
<EOS>
Ruin
!
<EOS>
shame
!
<EOS>
disgrace
!
<EOS>
said
I
<EOS>
,
I
fear
.
 
<EOS>
Pho
!
<EOS>
pho
!
<EOS>
said
she
;
if
you
have
any
doubt
about
it
,
he
can
best
explain
his
own
meaning
:
 
<EOS>
I
'll
send
him
word
to
come
and
satisfy
you
,
if
you
will
.
 
<EOS>
Horrid
creature
!
<EOS>
said
I
,
all
in
a
fright
 
<EOS>
Can'st
thou
not
stab
me
to
the
heart
?
 
<EOS>
I
'd
rather
<EOS>
thou
would'st
,
than
say
such
another
word
!
 
<EOS>
But
I
hope
there
is
no
such
thought
of
his
coming
.
  
<EOS>
She
had
the
wickedness
to
say
,
<EOS>
No
,
no
;
he
do
n't
intend
to
come
,
as
I
know
of
 
<EOS>
But
if
I
was
he
,
I
would
not
be
long
away
.
 
<EOS>
What
means
the
woman
?
<EOS>
said
I.
 
Mean
!
<EOS>
said
she
,
(
turning
it
off
;
)
<EOS>
why
I
mean
,
I
would
come
,
if
I
was
he
,
and
put
an
end
to
all
your
fears
 
by
making
you
as
happy
as
you
wish
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
out
of
his
power
,
said
I
,
to
make
me
happy
,
great
and
rich
as
he
is
!
<EOS>
but
by
leaving
me
innocent
,
and
giving
me
liberty
to
go
to
my
dear
father
and
mother
.
  
<EOS>
She
went
away
soon
after
,
and
I
ended
my
letter
,
in
hopes
to
have
an
opportunity
to
lay
it
in
the
appointed
place
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
went
to
her
,
and
said
;
I
suppose
,
as
it
is
not
dark
,
I
may
take
another
turn
in
the
garden
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
too
late
,
said
she
;
but
if
you
will
go
,
do
n't
stay
;
and
,
Nan
,
see
and
attend
madam
,
as
she
called
me
.
  
<EOS>
So
I
went
towards
the
pond
,
the
maid
following
me
,
and
dropt
purposely
my
hussy
:
<EOS>
and
when
I
came
near
the
tiles
,
I
said
,
Mrs.
Anne
,
I
have
dropt
my
hussy
;
be
so
kind
as
to
look
for
it
;
I
had
it
by
the
pond
side
.
 
<EOS>
She
went
back
to
look
,
and
I
slipt
the
note
between
the
tiles
,
and
covered
them
as
quick
as
I
could
with
the
light
mould
,
quite
unperceived
;
and
the
maid
finding
the
hussy
<EOS>
,
I
took
it
,
and
sauntered
in
again
,
and
met
Mrs.
Jewkes
coming
to
see
after
me
.
 
<EOS>
What
I
wrote
was
this
:
  
"
REVEREND
SIR
,
  
"
<EOS>
The
want
of
an
opportunity
to
speak
my
mind
to
you
,
I
am
sure
will
excuse
this
boldness
in
a
poor
creature
that
is
betrayed
hither
,
I
have
reason
to
think
,
for
the
worst
of
purposes
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
something
,
to
be
sure
,
of
my
story
,
my
native
poverty
,
which
I
am
not
ashamed
of
,
my
late
lady
's
goodness
,
and
my
master
's
designs
upon
me
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
true
he
promises
honour
,
and
all
that
;
but
the
honour
of
the
wicked
is
disgrace
and
shame
to
the
virtuous
:
And
he
may
think
he
keeps
his
promises
,
according
to
the
notions
he
may
allow
himself
to
hold
;
and
yet
,
according
to
nine
and
every
good
body
's
,
basely
ruin
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
so
wretched
,
and
ill
-
treated
by
this
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
and
she
is
so
ill
-
principled
a
woman
,
that
,
as
I
may
soon
want
the
opportunity
which
the
happy
hint
of
this
day
affords
to
my
hopes
,
I
throw
myself
at
once
upon
your
goodness
,
without
the
least
reserve
;
for
I
can
not
be
worse
than
I
am
,
should
that
fail
me
;
which
,
I
dare
say
,
to
your
power
,
it
will
not
:
<EOS>
For
I
see
it
,
sir
,
in
your
looks
,
I
hope
it
from
your
cloth
,
and
I
doubt
it
not
from
your
inclination
,
in
a
case
circumstanced
as
my
unhappy
one
is
.
 
<EOS>
For
,
sir
,
in
helping
me
out
of
my
present
distress
,
you
perform
all
the
acts
of
religion
in
one
;
and
the
highest
mercy
and
charity
,
both
to
the
body
and
soul
of
a
poor
wretch
,
that
,
believe
me
,
sir
,
has
,
at
present
,
not
so
much
as
in
thought
swerved
from
her
innocence
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
there
not
some
way
to
be
found
out
for
my
escape
,
without
danger
to
yourself
?
 
<EOS>
Is
there
no
gentleman
or
lady
of
virtue
in
this
neighbourhood
,
to
whom
I
may
fly
,
only
till
l
can
find
a
way
to
get
to
my
poor
father
and
mother
?
 
<EOS>
Can
not
Lady
Davers
be
made
acquainted
with
my
sad
story
,
by
your
conveying
a
letter
to
her
?
 
<EOS>
My
poor
parents
are
so
low
in
the
world
,
they
can
do
nothing
but
break
their
hearts
for
me
;
and
that
,
I
fear
,
will
be
the
end
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
master
promises
,
if
I
will
be
easy
,
as
he
calls
it
,
in
my
present
lot
,
he
will
not
come
down
without
my
consent
.
 
<EOS>
Alas
!
<EOS>
sir
,
this
is
nothing
:
For
what
's
the
promise
of
a
person
who
thinks
himself
at
liberty
to
act
as
he
has
done
by
me
?
 
<EOS>
If
he
comes
,
it
must
be
to
ruin
me
;
and
come
to
be
sure
he
will
,
when
he
thinks
he
has
silenced
the
clamours
of
my
friends
,
and
lulled
me
,
as
no
doubt
he
hopes
,
into
a
fatal
security
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
therefore
,
sir
,
is
all
the
time
I
have
to
work
and
struggle
for
the
preservation
of
my
honesty
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
stay
till
he
comes
,
I
am
undone
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
a
key
to
the
back
garden
door
;
I
have
great
hopes
from
that
.
 
<EOS>
Study
,
good
sir
,
and
contrive
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
faithfully
keep
your
secret
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
I
should
be
loath
to
have
you
suffer
for
me
!
 
<EOS>
I
say
no
more
,
but
commit
this
to
the
happy
tiles
,
in
the
bosom
of
that
earth
,
<EOS>
where
,
I
hope
,
my
deliverance
will
take
root
,
and
bring
forth
such
fruit
,
as
may
turn
to
my
inexpressible
joy
,
and
your
eternal
reward
,
both
here
and
hereafter
:

As
shall
ever
pray

<EOS>
Thursday
.
  
<EOS>
This
completes
a
terrible
week
since
my
setting
out
,
as
I
hoped
to
see
you
,
my
dear
father
and
mother
.
 
<EOS>
O
how
different
were
my
hopes
then
,
from
what
they
are
now
!
 
<EOS>
Yet
who
knows
what
these
happy
tiles
may
produce
!
  
<EOS>
But
I
must
tell
you
,
first
,
how
I
have
been
beaten
by
Mrs.
Jewkes
!
 
<EOS>
It
is
very
true
!
 
<EOS>
And
thus
it
came
about
:
  
<EOS>
My
impatience
was
great
to
walk
in
the
garden
,
to
see
if
any
thing
had
offered
,
answerable
to
my
hopes
.
 
<EOS>
But
this
wicked
Mrs.
Jewkes
would
not
let
me
go
without
her
;
and
said
,
she
was
not
at
leisure
.
 
<EOS>
We
had
a
great
many
words
about
it
;
for
I
told
her
,
it
was
very
hard
I
could
not
be
trusted
to
walk
by
myself
in
the
garden
for
a
little
air
,
but
must
be
dogged
and
watched
worse
than
a
thief
.
  
<EOS>
She
still
pleaded
her
instructions
,
and
said
she
was
not
to
trust
me
out
of
her
sight
:
<EOS>
And
you
had
better
,
said
she
,
be
easy
and
contented
<EOS>
,
I
assure
you
;
for
I
have
worse
orders
than
you
have
yet
found
.
 
<EOS>
I
remember
,
added
she
,
your
asking
Mr.
Williams
,
If
there
were
any
gentry
in
the
neighbourhood
?
 
<EOS>
This
makes
me
suspect
you
want
to
get
away
to
them
,
to
tell
your
sad
dismal
story
,
as
you
call
it
.
  
<EOS>
My
heart
was
at
my
mouth
;
for
I
feared
,
by
that
hint
,
she
had
seen
my
letter
under
the
tiles
:
<EOS>
O
how
uneasy
I
was
!
 
<EOS>
At
last
she
said
,
Well
,
since
you
take
on
so
,
you
may
take
a
turn
,
and
I
will
be
with
you
in
a
minute
.
  
<EOS>
When
I
was
out
of
sight
of
her
window
,
I
speeded
towards
the
hopeful
place
;
but
was
soon
forced
to
slacken
my
pace
,
by
her
odious
voice
:
Hey
-
day
,
why
so
nimble
,
and
whither
so
fast
?
<EOS>
said
she
:
<EOS>
What
!
<EOS>
are
you
upon
a
wager
?
 
<EOS>
I
stopt
for
her
,
till
her
pursy
sides
were
waddled
up
to
me
;
and
she
held
by
my
arm
,
half
out
of
breath
:
<EOS>
So
I
was
forced
to
pass
by
the
dear
place
,
without
daring
to
look
at
it
.
  
<EOS>
The
gardener
was
at
work
a
little
farther
,
and
so
we
looked
upon
him
,
and
I
began
to
talk
about
his
art
;
but
she
said
,
softly
,
My
instructions
are
,
not
to
let
you
be
so
familiar
with
the
servants
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
said
I
,
are
you
afraid
I
should
confederate
with
them
to
commit
a
robbery
upon
my
master
?
<EOS>
May
be
I
am
,
said
the
odious
wretch
;
for
to
rob
him
of
yourself
,
would
be
the
worst
that
could
happen
to
him
,
in
his
opinion
.
  
<EOS>
And
pray
,
said
I
,
walking
on
<EOS>
,
how
came
I
to
be
his
property
?
 
<EOS>
What
right
has
he
in
me
,
but
such
as
a
thief
<EOS>
may
plead
to
stolen
goods
?
 
<EOS>
Why
,
was
ever
the
like
heard
?
<EOS>
says
she
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
downright
rebellion
,
I
protest
!
  
<EOS>
Well
,
well
,
lambkin
,
(
which
the
foolish
often
calls
me
,
)
if
I
was
in
his
place
,
he
should
not
have
his
property
in
you
long
questionable
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
what
would
you
do
,
said
I
,
if
you
were
he
?
 
<EOS>
Not
stand
shill
-
<EOS>
I
-
shall
-
I
,
as
he
does
;
but
put
you
and
himself
both
out
of
your
pain
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
Jezebel
,
said
I
,
(
I
could
not
help
it
,
)
would
you
ruin
me
by
force
?
 
<EOS>
Upon
this
she
gave
me
a
deadly
slap
upon
my
shoulder
:
<EOS>
Take
that
,
said
she
;
whom
do
you
call
Jezebel
?
  
<EOS>
I
was
so
surprised
,
(
for
you
never
beat
me
,
my
dear
father
and
mother
,
in
your
lives
,
)
<EOS>
that
I
was
like
one
thunder
-
struck
;
and
looked
round
,
as
if
I
wanted
somebody
to
help
me
;
but
,
alas
!
<EOS>
I
had
nobody
;
and
said
,
at
last
,
rubbing
my
shoulder
,
Is
this
also
in
your
instructions
?
 
<EOS>
Alas
!
<EOS>
for
me
!
<EOS>
am
I
to
be
beaten
too
?
 
<EOS>
And
so
fell
a
crying
,
and
threw
myself
upon
the
grass
-
walk
we
were
upon
.
 
<EOS>
Said
she
,
in
a
great
pet
,
I
wo
n't
be
called
such
names
<EOS>
,
I
'll
assure
you
.
 
<EOS>
Marry
come
up
!
 
<EOS>
I
see
you
have
a
spirit
:
You
must
and
shall
be
kept
under
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
manage
such
little
provoking
things
as
you
,
I
warrant
ye
!
 
<EOS>
Come
,
come
,
we
'll
go
in
a'doors
,
and
I
'll
lock
you
up
,
and
you
shall
have
no
shoes
,
nor
any
thing
else
,
if
this
be
the
case
.
  
<EOS>
I
did
not
know
what
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
a
cruel
thing
to
me
,
and
I
blamed
myself
for
my
free
speech
;
for
now
I
have
given
her
some
pretence
:
<EOS>
and
O
!
<EOS>
thought
<EOS>
I
,
here
I
have
,
by
my
malapertness
,
ruined
the
only
project
I
had
left
.
  
<EOS>
The
gardener
saw
this
scene
:
but
she
called
to
him
,
<EOS>
Well
,
Jacob
,
what
do
you
stare
at
?
 
<EOS>
Pray
mind
what
you
're
upon
.
 
<EOS>
And
away
he
walked
,
to
another
quarter
,
out
of
sight
.
  
<EOS>
Well
,
thought
I
,
I
must
put
on
the
dissembler
a
little
,
I
see
.
 
<EOS>
She
took
my
hand
roughly
;
Come
,
get
up
,
said
she
,
and
come
in
a'doors
!
 
<EOS>
I
'll
Jezebel
you
,
I
will
so
!
 
<EOS>
Why
,
dear
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
said
I.
 
None
of
your
dears
,
and
your
coaxing
!
<EOS>
said
she
;
why
not
Jezebel
again
?
 
<EOS>
She
was
in
a
fearful
passion
,
I
saw
,
and
I
was
out
of
my
wits
.
<EOS>
thought
I
<EOS>
,
I
have
often
heard
women
blamed
for
their
tongues
;
I
wish
mine
had
been
shorter
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
ca
n't
go
in
,
said
I
,
indeed
I
ca
n't
!
 
<EOS>
Why
,
said
she
,
ca
n't
you
?
 
<EOS>
I
'll
warrant
I
can
take
such
a
thin
body
as
you
under
my
arm
,
and
carry
you
in
,
if
you
wo
n't
walk
.
 
<EOS>
You
do
n't
know
my
strength
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
but
I
do
,
said
I
,
too
well
;
and
will
you
not
use
me
worse
when
I
come
in
?
 
<EOS>
So
I
arose
,
and
she
muttered
to
herself
all
the
way
<EOS>
,
She
to
be
a
Jezebel
with
me
,
that
had
used
me
so
well
!
<EOS>
and
such
like
.
  
<EOS>
When
I
came
near
the
house
,
I
said
,
sitting
down
upon
a
settle
-
bench
,
<EOS>
Well
,
I
will
not
go
in
,
till
you
say
you
forgive
me
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
will
forgive
my
calling
you
that
name
,
I
will
forgive
your
beating
me
.
  
<EOS>
She
sat
down
by
me
,
and
seemed
in
a
great
pucker
,
and
said
,
Well
,
come
,
I
will
forgive
you
for
this
time
:
and
so
kissed
me
,
as
a
mark
of
reconciliation
.
 
<EOS>
But
pray
,
said
I
,
tell
me
where
I
am
to
walk
and
go
,
and
give
me
what
liberty
you
can
;
and
when
I
know
the
most
you
can
favour
me
with
,
you
shall
see
I
will
be
as
content
as
I
can
,
and
not
ask
you
for
more
.
  
<EOS>
Ay
,
said
she
,
this
is
something
like
:
I
wish
I
could
give
you
all
the
liberty
you
desire
;
for
you
must
think
it
is
no
pleasure
to
me
to
tie
you
to
my
petticoat
,
as
it
were
,
and
not
let
you
stir
without
me
.
 
<EOS>
But
people
that
will
do
their
duties
,
must
have
some
trouble
:
and
what
I
do
,
is
to
serve
as
good
a
master
,
to
be
sure
,
as
lives
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
said
I
,
to
every
body
but
me
!
 
<EOS>
He
loves
you
too
well
,
to
be
sure
,
returned
she
;
and
that
's
the
reason
:
<EOS>
so
you
ought
to
bear
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
,
love
!
<EOS>
replied
I.
 
Come
,
said
she
,
do
n't
let
the
wench
see
you
have
been
crying
,
nor
tell
her
any
tales
:
for
you
wo
n't
tell
them
fairly
,
I
am
sure
:
<EOS>
and
I
'll
send
her
,
and
you
shall
take
another
walk
in
the
garden
,
if
you
will
:
May
be
it
will
get
you
a
stomach
to
your
dinner
:
for
you
do
n't
eat
enough
to
keep
life
and
soul
together
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
beauty
to
the
bone
,
added
the
strange
wretch
,
or
you
could
not
look
so
well
as
you
do
,
with
so
little
stomach
,
so
little
rest
,
and
so
much
pining
and
whining
for
nothing
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
thought
I
,
say
what
thou
wilt
,
so
I
can
be
rid
of
thy
bad
tongue
and
company
:
and
I
hope
to
find
some
opportunity
now
to
come
at
my
sunflower
.
<EOS>
But
I
walked
the
other
way
,
to
take
that
in
my
return
,
to
avoid
suspicion
.
  
<EOS>
I
forced
my
discourse
to
the
maid
;
but
it
was
all
upon
general
things
;
for
I
find
she
is
asked
after
every
thing
I
say
and
do
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
came
near
the
place
,
as
I
had
been
devising
,
I
said
,
Pray
step
to
the
gardener
,
and
ask
him
to
gather
a
sallad
for
me
to
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
She
called
out
,
Jacob
!
<EOS>
said
I
,
He
ca
n't
hear
you
so
far
off
;
and
pray
tell
him
,
I
should
like
a
cucumber
too
,
if
he
has
one
.
 
<EOS>
When
she
had
stept
about
a
bow
-
shot
from
me
,
I
popt
down
,
and
whipt
my
fingers
under
the
upper
tile
,
and
pulled
out
a
letter
without
direction
,
and
thrust
it
in
my
bosom
,
trembling
for
joy
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
with
me
,
before
I
could
well
secure
it
;
and
I
was
in
such
a
taking
that
I
feared
I
should
discover
myself
.
 
<EOS>
You
seem
frightened
,
madam
,
said
she
;
Why
,
said
I
,
with
a
lucky
thought
,
(
alas
!
<EOS>
your
poor
daughter
will
make
an
intriguer
by
and
by
;
but
I
hope
an
innocent
one
!
)
<EOS>
I
stooped
to
smell
at
the
sunflower
,
and
a
great
nasty
worm
ran
into
the
ground
,
that
startled
me
;
for
I
ca
n't
abide
worms
.
 
<EOS>
Said
she
<EOS>
,
Sunflowers
do
n't
smell
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
find
,
replied
I.
 
<EOS>
And
then
we
walked
in
;
and
Mrs.
Jewkes
said
;
<EOS>
Well
,
you
have
made
haste
now
.
 
<EOS>
You
shall
go
another
time
.
  
<EOS>
I
went
up
to
my
closet
,
locked
myself
in
,
and
opening
my
letter
,
found
in
it
these
words
:
  
"
I
am
infinitely
concerned
for
your
distress
.
 
<EOS>
I
most
heartily
wish
it
may
be
in
my
power
to
serve
and
save
so
much
innocence
,
beauty
,
and
merit
.
 
<EOS>
My
whole
dependance
is
upon
Mr.
B
#
#
#
#
,
and
I
have
a
near
view
of
being
provided
for
by
his
favour
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
But
yet
I
would
sooner
forfeit
all
my
hopes
in
him
,
(
trusting
in
God
for
the
rest
,
)
than
not
assist
you
,
if
possible
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
looked
upon
Mr.
B
#
#
#
#
in
the
light
he
now
appears
in
to
me
,
in
your
case
.
 
<EOS>
To
be
sure
,
he
is
no
professed
debauchee
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
am
entirely
of
opinion
<EOS>
,
you
should
,
if
possible
,
get
out
of
his
hands
;
and
especially
as
you
are
in
very
bad
ones
in
Mrs.
Jewkes
's
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
have
here
the
widow
Lady
Jones
,
mistress
of
a
good
fortune
;
and
a
woman
of
virtue
,
I
believe
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
also
old
Sir
Simon
Darnford
,
and
his
lady
,
who
is
a
good
woman
;
and
they
have
two
daughters
,
virtuous
young
ladies
.
 
<EOS>
All
the
rest
are
but
middling
people
,
and
traders
,
at
best
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
try
,
if
you
please
,
either
Lady
Jones
,
or
Lady
Darnford
,
if
they
'll
permit
you
to
take
refuge
with
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
no
probability
of
keeping
myself
concealed
in
this
matter
;
but
will
,
as
I
said
,
risk
all
things
to
serve
you
;
for
I
never
saw
a
sweetness
and
innocence
like
yours
;
and
your
hard
case
has
attached
me
entirely
to
you
;
<EOS>
for
I
know
,
as
you
so
happily
express
,
if
I
can
serve
you
in
this
case
,
I
shall
thereby
perform
all
the
acts
of
religion
in
one
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
to
Lady
Davers
,
I
will
convey
a
letter
,
if
you
please
,
to
her
;
but
it
must
not
be
from
our
post
-
house
,
I
give
you
caution
;
for
the
man
owes
all
his
bread
to
Mr.
B
#
#
#
#
,
and
his
place
too
;
and
I
believe
,
by
something
that
dropt
from
him
,
over
a
can
of
ale
,
has
his
instructions
.
 
<EOS>
You
do
n't
know
how
you
are
surrounded
;
all
which
confirms
me
in
your
opinion
,
that
no
honour
is
meant
you
,
let
what
will
be
professed
;
and
I
am
glad
you
want
no
caution
on
that
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
Give
me
leave
to
say
,
that
I
had
heard
much
in
your
praise
;
but
,
I
think
,
greatly
short
of
what
you
deserve
,
both
as
to
person
and
mind
:
<EOS>
My
eyes
convince
me
of
the
one
,
your
letter
of
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
For
fear
of
losing
the
present
lucky
opportunity
,
I
am
longer
than
otherwise
I
should
be
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
will
not
enlarge
,
any
further
than
to
assure
you
that
I
am
,
to
the
best
of
my
power
,
                      
"
<EOS>
Your
faithful
friend
and
servant

ARTHUR

<EOS>
"
I
will
come
once
every
morning
,
and
once
every
evening
,
after
school
-
time
,
to
look
for
your
letters

<EOS>
I
'll
come
in

return
without
going
into
the

if
I
see
the
coast
clear

Otherwise
,
to
avoid
suspicion

I
'll
come
in

<EOS>
I
instantly
,
in
answer
to
this
pleasing
letter
,
wrote
as
follows
:
  
"
REVEREND
SIR
,
  
"
<EOS>
O
how
suited
to
your
function
,
and
your
character
,
is
your
kind
letter
!
<EOS>
God
bless
you
for
it
!
 
<EOS>
I
now
think
I
am
beginning
to
be
happy
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
be
sorry
to
have
you
suffer
on
my
account
:
<EOS>
but
I
hope
it
will
be
made
up
to
you
an
hundred
-
fold
,
by
that
God
whom
you
so
faithfully
serve
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
be
too
happy
<EOS>
,
could
I
ever
have
it
in
my
power
to
contribute
in
the
least
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
alas
!
<EOS>
to
serve
me
,
must
be
for
God
's
sake
only
;
for
I
am
poor
and
lowly
in
fortune
;
though
in
mind
,
I
hope
,
too
high
to
do
a
mean
or
unworthy
deed
to
gain
a
kingdom
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
lose
time
.
<EOS>

"
Any
way
you
think
best
,
I
should
be
pleased
with
;
for
I
know
not
the
persons
,
nor
in
what
manner
it
is
best
to
apply
to
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
glad
of
the
hint
you
so
kindly
give
me
of
the
man
at
the
post
-
house
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
thinking
of
opening
a
way
for
myself
by
letter
,
when
I
could
have
opportunity
;
but
I
see
more
and
more
that
I
am
,
indeed
,
strangely
surrounded
with
dangers
;
and
that
there
is
no
dependance
to
be
made
on
my
master
's
honour
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
think
,
sir
,
if
either
of
those
ladies
would
give
leave
,
I
might
some
way
get
out
by
favour
of
your
key
:
and
as
it
is
impossible
,
watched
as
I
am
,
to
know
when
it
can
be
,
suppose
,
sir
,
you
get
one
made
by
it
,
and
put
it
,
the
next
opportunity
,
under
the
sunflower
?
 
<EOS>
I
am
sure
no
time
is
to
be
lost
,
because
it
is
rather
my
wonder
,
that
she
is
not
thoughtful
about
this
key
,
than
otherwise
;
for
she
forgets
not
the
minutest
thing
.
<EOS>
But
,
sir
,
if
I
had
this
key
,
I
could
,
if
these
ladies
would
not
shelter
me
,
run
away
any
where
:
and
if
I
was
once
out
of
the
house
,
they
could
have
no
pretence
to
force
me
again
;
for
I
have
done
no
harm
,
and
hope
to
make
my
story
good
to
any
compassionate
body
;
and
by
this
way
you
need
not
to
be
known
.
 
<EOS>
Torture
should
not
wring
it
from
me
,
I
assure
you
.
  
<EOS>
"
One
thing
more
,
good
sir
.
 
<EOS>
Have
you
no
correspondence
with
my
master
's
Bedfordshire
family
?
 
<EOS>
By
that
means
,
may
be
,
I
could
be
informed
of
his
intention
of
coming
hither
,
and
when
I
enclose
you
a
letter
of
a
deceitful
wretch
;
for
I
can
trust
you
with
any
thing
;
<EOS>
poor
John
Arnold
.
<EOS>
Its
contents
will
tell
why
I
enclose
it
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
by
his
means
,
something
may
be
discovered
;
for
he
seems
willing
to
atone
for
his
treachery
to
me
,
by
the
intimation
of
future
service
.
 
<EOS>
I
leave
the
hint
to
you
to
improve
upon
,
and
am
,
              
"
Reverend
Sir
,
                  
"
Your
for
ever
obliged
,
and
thankful
servant
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
,
sir
,
by
your
favour
,
I
could
send
a
little
packet
,
now
and
then
,
<EOS>
some
how
,
to
my
poor
father
and
mother
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
little
stock
of
money
,
<EOS>
about
five
or
six
guineas
<EOS>
:
Shall
I
put
half
in
your
hands
,
to
defray
the
charge
of
a
man
and
horse
,
or
any
other
incidents
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
had
but
just
time
to
transcribe
this
,
before
I
was
called
to
dinner
;
and
I
put
that
for
Mr.
Williams
,
with
a
wafer
in
it
,
in
my
bosom
,
to
get
an
opportunity
to
lay
it
in
the
dear
place
.
  
<EOS>
O
good
sirs
,
of
all
the
flowers
in
the
garden
,
the
sunflower
,
sure
,
is
the
loveliest
!
 
<EOS>
It
is
a
propitious
one
to
me
!
 
<EOS>
How
nobly
my
plot
succeeds
!
 
<EOS>
But
I
begin
to
be
afraid
my
writings
may
be
discovered
;
for
they
grow
large
:
I
stitch
them
hitherto
in
my
under
-
coat
,
next
my
linen
.
<EOS>
But
if
this
brute
should
search
me
 
I
must
try
to
please
her
,
and
then
she
wo
n't
.
  
<EOS>
Well
,
I
am
but
just
come
off
from
a
walk
in
the
garden
,
and
have
deposited
my
letter
by
a
simple
wile
.
 
<EOS>
I
got
some
horse
-
beans
;
and
we
took
a
turn
in
the
garden
,
to
angle
,
as
Mrs.
Jewkes
had
promised
me
.
 
<EOS>
She
baited
the
hook
,
and
I
held
it
,
and
soon
hooked
a
lovely
carp
.
 
<EOS>
Play
it
,
play
it
,
said
she
:
<EOS>
I
did
,
and
brought
it
to
the
bank
.
 
<EOS>
A
sad
thought
just
then
came
into
my
head
;
and
I
took
it
,
and
threw
it
in
again
;
and
<EOS>
O
the
pleasure
<EOS>
it
seemed
to
have
,
to
flounce
in
,
when
at
liberty
!
 
<EOS>
Why
this
?
says
she
.
 
<EOS>
O
Mrs.
Jewkes
!
<EOS>
said
I
,
I
was
thinking
this
poor
carp
was
the
unhappy
Pamela
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
likening
you
and
myself
to
my
naughty
master
.
 
<EOS>
As
we
hooked
and
deceived
the
poor
carp
,
so
was
I
betrayed
by
false
baits
;
and
when
you
said
,
Play
it
,
play
it
,
it
went
to
my
heart
,
to
think
I
should
sport
with
the
destruction
of
the
poor
fish
I
had
betrayed
;
and
I
could
not
but
fling
it
in
again
:
and
did
you
not
see
the
joy
with
which
the
happy
carp
flounced
from
us
?
 
<EOS>
O
!
<EOS>
said
I
,
may
some
good
merciful
body
procure
me
<EOS>
my
liberty
in
the
same
manner
<EOS>
;
for
to
be
sure
,
I
think
my
danger
equal
!
  
<EOS>
Lord
bless
thee
!
<EOS>
said
she
,
what
a
thought
is
there
!
 
<EOS>
Well
,
I
can
angle
no
more
,
added
I.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
try
my
fortune
,
said
she
,
and
took
the
rod
.
 
<EOS>
Do
,
answered
I
;
and
I
will
plant
life
,
if
I
can
,
while
you
are
destroying
it
.
<EOS>
I
have
some
horse
-
beans
here
,
and
will
go
and
stick
them
in
one
of
the
borders
,
to
see
how
long
they
will
be
coming
up
;
and
I
will
call
them
my
garden
.
  
<EOS>
So
you
see
,
dear
father
and
mother
,
<EOS>
(
I
hope
now
you
will
soon
see
;
for
,
may
be
,
if
I
ca
n't
get
away
<EOS>
so
soon
myself
,
I
may
send
my
papers
some
<EOS>
how
;
I
say
you
will
see
,
)
that
this
furnishes
me
with
a
good
excuse
to
look
after
my
garden
another
time
;
and
if
the
mould
should
look
a
little
freshish
,
it
wo
n't
be
so
much
suspected
.
 
<EOS>
She
mistrusted
nothing
of
this
;
and
I
went
and
stuck
in
here
<EOS>
and
there
my
beans
,
for
about
the
length
of
five
ells
,
of
each
side
of
the
sunflower
;
and
easily
deposited
my
letter
.
<EOS>
And
not
a
little
proud
am
I
of
this
contrivance
.
 
<EOS>
Sure
something
will
do
at
last
!
  
<EOS>
Friday
,
Saturday
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
just
now
told
you
a
trick
of
mine
;
now
I
'll
tell
you
a
trick
of
this
wicked
woman
's
.
 
<EOS>
She
comes
up
to
me
:
<EOS>
Says
she
,
I
have
a
bill
I
can
not
change
till
to
-
morrow
;
and
a
tradesman
wants
his
money
most
sadly
:
<EOS>
and
I
do
n't
love
to
turn
poor
trades
-
folks
away
without
their
money
:
Have
you
any
about
you
?
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
little
,
replied
I
:
How
much
will
do
?
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
said
she
,
I
want
eight
pounds
.
 
<EOS>
Alack
!
<EOS>
said
I
,
I
have
but
between
five
and
six
.
 
<EOS>
Lend
me
that
,
said
she
,
till
to
-
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
I
did
so
;
and
she
went
down
stairs
:
<EOS>
and
when
she
came
up
,
she
laughed
,
and
said
,
Well
,
I
have
paid
the
tradesman
.
 
<EOS>
Said
I
<EOS>
,
I
hope
you
'll
give
it
me
again
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
At
that
,
the
assurance
,
laughing
loud
,
said
,
Why
,
what
occasion
have
you
for
money
?
 
<EOS>
To
tell
you
the
truth
,
lambkin
,
I
did
n't
want
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
only
feared
you
might
make
a
bad
use
of
it
;
and
now
I
can
trust
Nan
with
you
a
little
oftener
,
especially
as
I
have
got
the
key
of
your
portmanteau
;
so
that
you
can
neither
corrupt
her
with
money
,
nor
fine
things
.
 
<EOS>
Never
did
any
body
look
more
silly
than
I.
 
<EOS>
O
how
I
fretted
,
to
be
so
foolishly
outwitted
!
 
<EOS>
And
the
more
,
as
I
had
hinted
to
Mr.
Williams
<EOS>
,
that
I
would
put
some
in
his
hands
to
defray
the
charges
of
my
sending
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
cried
for
vexation
.
 
<EOS>
And
now
I
have
not
five
shillings
left
to
support
me
,
if
I
can
get
away
.
 
<EOS>
Was
ever
such
a
fool
as
I
!
 
<EOS>
I
must
be
priding
myself
in
my
contrivances
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
said
I.
 
Was
this
your
instructions
,
wolfkin
?
<EOS>
(
for
she
called
me
lambkin
)
.
 
<EOS>
Jezebel
,
you
mean
,
child
!
<EOS>
said
she
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
I
now
forgive
you
heartily
;
let
's
buss
and
be
friends
.
 
<EOS>
Out
upon
you
said
I
;
I
can
not
bear
you
!
 
<EOS>
But
I
durst
not
call
her
names
again
;
for
I
dread
her
huge
paw
most
sadly
.
 
<EOS>
The
more
I
think
of
this
thing
,
the
more
do
I
regret
it
,
and
blame
myself
.
  
<EOS>
This
night
the
man
from
the
post
-
house
brought
a
letter
for
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
in
which
was
one
enclosed
for
me
:
She
brought
it
me
up
.
 
<EOS>
Said
she
,
Well
,
my
good
master
do
n't
forget
us
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
sent
you
a
letter
:
and
see
what
he
writes
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
So
she
read
<EOS>
,
That
he
hoped
her
fair
charge
was
well
,
happy
,
and
contented
.
 
<EOS>
Ay
,
to
be
sure
,
said
I
,
I
ca
n't
choose
 
That
he
did
not
doubt
her
care
and
kindness
to
me
:
that
I
was
very
dear
to
him
,
and
she
could
not
use
me
too
well
;
and
the
like
.
 
<EOS>
There
's
a
master
for
you
!
<EOS>
said
she
:
sure
you
will
love
and
pray
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
desired
her
to
read
the
rest
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
no
,
said
she
,
but
I
wo
n't
.
 
<EOS>
Said
I
<EOS>
,
Are
there
any
orders
for
taking
my
shoes
away
,
and
for
beating
me
?
 
<EOS>
No
,
said
she
,
nor
about
Jezebel
<EOS>
neither
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
returned
I
<EOS>
,
I
cry
truce
;
for
I
have
no
mind
to
be
beat
again
.
 
<EOS>
I
thought
,
said
she
,
we
had
forgiven
one
another
.
  
<EOS>
My
letter
is
as
follows
:
  
<EOS>
"
MY
DEAR
PAMELA
,
  
"
I
begin
to
repent
already
,
that
I
have
bound
myself
,
by
promise
,
not
to
see
you
till
you
give
me
leave
;
for
I
think
the
time
very
tedious
.
 
<EOS>
Can
you
place
so
much
confidence
in
me
,
as
to
invite
me
down
?
 
<EOS>
Assure
yourself
,
that
your
generosity
shall
not
be
thrown
away
upon
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
the
rather
would
press
this
,
as
I
am
uneasy
for
your
uneasiness
;
for
Mrs.
Jewkes
acquaints
me
,
that
you
take
your
restraint
very
heavily
;
and
neither
eat
,
drink
,
nor
rest
well
;
and
I
have
too
great
interest
in
your
health
,
not
to
wish
to
shorten
the
time
of
this
trial
;
which
will
be
the
consequence
of
my
coming
down
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
John
,
too
,
has
intimated
to
me
your
concern
,
with
a
grief
that
hardly
gave
him
leave
for
utterance
;
a
grief
that
a
little
alarmed
my
tenderness
for
you
.
 
<EOS>
Not
that
I
fear
any
thing
,
but
that
your
disregard
to
me
,
which
yet
my
proud
heart
will
hardly
permit
me
to
own
,
may
throw
you
upon
some
rashness
,
that
might
encourage
a
daring
hope
:
<EOS>
But
how
poorly
do
I
descend
,
to
be
anxious
about
such
a
menial
as
he
!
 
<EOS>
I
will
only
say
one
thing
,
that
if
you
will
give
me
leave
to
attend
you
at
the
Hall
,
(
consider
who
it
is
that
requests
this
from
you
as
a
favour
,
)
I
solemnly
declare
,
that
you
shall
have
cause
to
be
pleased
with
this
obliging
mark
of
your
confidence
in
me
,
and
consideration
for
me
;
and
if
I
find
Mrs.
Jewkes
has
not
behaved
to
you
with
the
respect
due
to
one
<EOS>
I
so
dearly
love
,
I
will
put
it
entirely
into
your
power
to
discharge
her
the
house
,
if
you
think
proper
;
and
Mrs.
Jervis
,
or
who
else
you
please
,
shall
attend
you
in
her
place
.
 
<EOS>
This
<EOS>
I
say
on
a
hint
John
gave
me
,
as
if
you
resented
something
from
that
quarter
.
 
<EOS>
Dearest
Pamela
,
answer
favourably
this
earnest
request
of
one
that
can
not
live
without
you
,
and
on
whose
honour
to
you
,
you
may
absolutely
depend
;
and
so
much
the
more
,
as
you
place
a
confidence
in
it
.
<EOS>
I
am
,
and
assuredly
ever
will
be
,
                       
"
Your
faithful
and
affectionate
,
etc
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
be
glad
,
I
know
,
to
hear
your
father
and
mother
are
well
,
and
easy
upon
your
last
letter
.
 
<EOS>
That
gave
me
a
pleasure
that
I
am
resolved
you
shall
not
repent
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
will
convey
to
me
your
answer
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
but
slightly
read
this
letter
for
the
present
,
to
give
way
to
one
<EOS>
I
had
hopes
of
finding
by
this
time
from
Mr.
Williams
.
 
<EOS>
I
took
an
evening
turn
,
as
I
called
it
,
in
Mrs.
Jewkes
's
company
:
and
walking
by
the
place
,
I
said
,
<EOS>
Do
you
think
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
any
of
my
beans
can
have
struck
since
yesterday
?
 
<EOS>
She
laughed
,
and
said
,
You
are
a
poor
gardener
:
<EOS>
but
I
love
to
see
you
divert
yourself
.
 
<EOS>
She
passing
on
<EOS>
,
I
found
my
good
friend
had
provided
for
me
;
and
,
slipping
it
in
my
bosom
,
(
for
her
back
was
towards
me
,
)
<EOS>
Here
,
said
I
,
(
having
a
bean
in
my
hand
,
)
is
one
of
them
;
but
it
has
not
stirred
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
to
be
sure
,
said
she
,
and
turned
upon
me
a
most
wicked
jest
,
unbecoming
the
mouth
of
a
woman
,
about
planting
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
came
in
,
I
hied
to
my
closet
,
and
read
as
follows
:
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
to
tell
you
that
I
have
had
a
repulse
from
Lady
Jones
.
 
<EOS>
She
is
concerned
at
your
case
,
she
says
,
but
do
n't
care
to
make
herself
enemies
.
 
<EOS>
I
applied
to
Lady
Darnford
,
and
told
her
in
the
most
pathetic
manner
I
could
,
your
sad
story
,
and
shewed
her
your
more
pathetic
letter
.
<EOS>
I
found
her
well
disposed
,
but
she
would
advise
with
Sir
Simon
,
who
by
the
by
is
not
a
man
of
an
extraordinary
character
for
virtue
;
but
he
said
to
his
lady
in
my
presence
,
"
Why
,
what
is
all
this
,
my
dear
,
but
that
our
neighbour
has
a
mind
to
his
mother
's
waiting
-
maid
!
 
<EOS>
And
if
he
takes
care
she
wants
for
nothing
<EOS>
,
I
do
n't
see
any
great
injury
will
be
done
her
.
 
<EOS>
He
hurts
no
family
by
this
:
"
<EOS>
(
So
,
my
dear
father
and
mother
,
it
seems
that
poor
people
's
honesty
is
to
go
for
nothing
)
"
<EOS>
And
I
think
,
Mr.
Williams
,
you
,
of
all
men
,
should
not
engage
in
this
affair
,
against
your
friend
and
patron
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
He
spoke
this
in
<EOS>
so
determined
a
manner
,
that
the
lady
had
done
;
and
I
had
only
to
beg
no
notice
should
be
taken
of
the
matter
as
from
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
hinted
your
case
to
Mr.
Peters
,
the
minister
of
this
parish
;
but
I
am
concerned
to
say
,
that
he
imputed
selfish
views
to
me
,
as
if
I
would
make
an
interest
in
your
affections
by
my
zeal
.
 
<EOS>
And
when
I
represented
the
duties
of
our
function
,
and
the
like
,
and
protested
my
disinterestedness
,
he
coldly
said
,
I
was
very
good
;
but
was
a
young
man
,
and
knew
little
of
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
And
though
it
was
a
thing
to
be
lamented
,
yet
when
he
and
I
should
set
about
to
reform
mankind
in
this
respect
,
we
should
have
enough
upon
our
hands
;
for
,
he
said
,
it
was
too
common
and
fashionable
a
case
to
be
withstood
by
a
private
clergyman
or
two
:
<EOS>
and
then
he
uttered
some
reflections
upon
the
conduct
of
the
present
fathers
of
the
church
,
in
regard
to
the
first
personages
of
the
realm
,
as
a
justification
of
his
coldness
on
this
score
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
represented
the
different
circumstances
of
your
affair
;
that
other
women
lived
evilly
by
their
own
consent
,
but
to
serve
you
,
was
to
save
an
innocence
that
had
but
few
examples
;
and
then
I
shewed
him
your
letter
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
said
it
was
prettily
written
:
and
he
was
sorry
for
you
;
and
that
your
good
intentions
ought
to
be
encouraged
:
<EOS>
But
what
,
said
he
,
would
you
have
me
do
,
Mr.
Williams
?
 
<EOS>
Why
suppose
,
sir
,
said
I
,
you
give
her
shelter
in
your
house
,
with
your
spouse
and
niece
,
till
she
can
get
to
her
friends
.
  
<EOS>
W
hat
!
<EOS>
and
embroil
myself
with
a
man
of
Mr.
B
#
#
#
#
's
power
and
fortune
!
<EOS>
No
,
not
I
,
I
'll
assure
you
!
 
<EOS>
And
I
would
have
you
consider
what
you
are
about
.
 
<EOS>
Besides
,
she
owns
,
continued
he
,
that
he
promises
to
do
honourably
by
her
;
and
her
shyness
will
procure
her
good
terns
enough
;
for
he
is
no
covetous
nor
wicked
gentleman
,
except
in
this
case
;
and
'
tis
what
all
young
gentlemen
will
do
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
greatly
concerned
for
him
,
I
assure
you
:
but
I
am
not
discouraged
by
this
ill
success
,
let
what
will
come
of
it
,
if
I
can
serve
you
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
hear
,
as
yet
,
that
Mr.
B
#
#
#
#
is
coming
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
glad
of
your
hint
as
to
that
unhappy
fellow
John
Arnold
.
 
<EOS>
Something
,
perhaps
,
will
strike
out
from
that
,
which
may
be
useful
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
your
packets
,
if
you
seal
them
up
,
and
lay
them
in
the
usual
place
,
if
you
find
it
not
suspected
,
I
will
watch
an
opportunity
to
convey
them
;
but
if
they
are
large
,
you
had
best
be
very
cautious
.
 
<EOS>
This
evil
woman
,
I
find
,
mistrusts
me
much
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
just
hear
,
that
the
gentleman
is
dying
,
whose
living
Mr.
B
#
#
#
#
has
promised
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
almost
a
scruple
to
take
it
,
as
I
am
acting
so
contrary
to
his
desires
:
<EOS>
but
I
hope
he
will
one
day
thank
me
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
money
,
do
n't
think
of
it
at
present
.
 
<EOS>
Be
assured
you
may
command
all
in
my
power
to
do
for
you
without
reserve
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
,
when
we
hear
he
is
coming
,
it
will
be
best
to
make
use
of
the
key
,
which
I
shall
soon
procure
you
;
and
I
can
borrow
a
horse
for
you
,
I
believe
,
to
wait
within
half
a
mile
of
the
back
-
door
,
over
the
pasture
;
and
will
contrive
,
by
myself
,
or
somebody
,
to
have
you
conducted
some
miles
distant
,
to
one
of
the
villages
thereabouts
;
so
do
n't
be
discomforted
,
I
beseech
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
,
excellent
Mrs.
Pamela
,
                                           
"
<EOS>
Your
faithful
friend
,
etc
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
made
a
thousand
sad
reflections
upon
the
former
part
of
this
honest
gentleman
's
kind
letter
;
and
but
for
the
hope
he
gave
me
at
last
,
should
have
given
up
my
case
as
quite
desperate
.
 
<EOS>
I
then
wrote
to
thank
him
most
gratefully
for
his
kind
endeavours
;
to
lament
the
little
concern
the
gentry
had
for
my
deplorable
case
;
the
wickedness
of
the
world
,
first
to
give
way
to
such
iniquitous
fashions
,
and
then
plead
the
frequency
of
them
,
against
the
attempt
to
amend
them
;
and
how
unaffected
people
were
with
the
distresses
of
others
.
 
<EOS>
I
recalled
my
former
hint
as
to
writing
to
Lady
Davers
,
which
I
feared
<EOS>
,
I
said
,
would
only
serve
to
apprise
her
brother
,
that
she
knew
his
wicked
scheme
,
and
more
harden
him
in
it
,
and
make
him
come
down
the
sooner
,
and
to
be
the
more
determined
on
my
ruin
;
besides
that
it
might
make
Mr.
Williams
guessed
at
,
as
a
means
of
conveying
my
letter
:
And
being
very
fearful
,
that
if
that
good
lady
would
interest
herself
in
my
behalf
,
(
which
was
a
doubt
,
because
she
both
loved
and
feared
her
brother
,
)
it
would
have
no
effect
upon
him
;
and
that
therefore
I
would
wait
the
happy
event
I
might
hope
for
from
his
kind
assistance
in
the
key
,
and
the
horse
.
 
<EOS>
I
intimated
my
master
's
letter
,
begging
to
be
permitted
to
come
down
:
was
fearful
it
might
be
sudden
;
and
that
I
was
of
opinion
<EOS>
no
time
was
to
be
lost
;
for
we
might
let
slip
all
our
opportunities
;
telling
him
the
money
trick
of
this
vile
woman
,
etc
.
  
<EOS>
I
had
not
time
to
take
a
copy
of
this
letter
,
I
was
so
watched
.
 
<EOS>
And
when
I
had
it
ready
in
my
bosom
,
I
was
easy
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
I
went
to
seek
out
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
and
told
her
,
I
would
have
her
advice
upon
the
letter
I
had
received
from
my
master
;
<EOS>
which
point
of
confidence
in
her
pleased
her
not
a
little
.
 
<EOS>
Ay
,
said
she
,
now
this
is
something
like
:
and
we
'll
take
a
turn
in
the
garden
,
or
where
you
please
.
 
<EOS>
I
pretended
it
was
indifferent
to
me
;
and
so
we
walked
into
the
garden
.
 
<EOS>
I
began
to
talk
to
her
of
the
letter
;
but
was
far
from
acquainting
her
with
all
the
contents
;
only
that
he
wanted
my
consent
to
come
down
,
and
hoped
she
used
me
kindly
,
and
the
like
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
said
,
Now
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
let
me
have
your
advice
as
to
this
.
<EOS>
Why
then
,
said
she
,
I
will
give
it
you
freely
;
E'en
send
to
him
to
come
down
.
 
<EOS>
It
will
highly
oblige
him
,
and
I
dare
say
you
'll
fare
the
better
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
How
the
better
?
<EOS>
said
<EOS>
I.
 
I
dare
say
,
you
think
yourself
,
that
he
intends
my
ruin
.
 
<EOS>
I
hate
,
said
she
,
<EOS>
that
foolish
word
,
your
ruin
!
 
<EOS>
Why
,
ne'er
a
lady
in
the
land
may
live
happier
than
you
if
you
will
,
or
be
more
honourably
used
.
  
<EOS>
Well
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
said
I
,
I
shall
not
,
at
this
time
,
dispute
with
you
about
the
words
ruin
and
honourable
:
for
I
find
we
have
quite
different
notions
of
both
:
<EOS>
But
now
I
will
speak
plainer
than
ever
<EOS>
I
did
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
think
he
intends
to
make
proposals
to
me
as
to
a
kept
mistress
,
or
kept
slave
rather
,
or
do
you
not
?
 
<EOS>
Why
,
lambkin
,
said
she
,
<EOS>
what
dost
thou
think
thyself
?
 
<EOS>
I
fear
,
said
I
,
he
does
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
said
she
,
but
if
he
does
,
(
for
I
know
nothing
of
the
matter
<EOS>
,
I
assure
you
,
)
<EOS>
you
may
have
your
own
terms
 
<EOS>
I
see
that
;
for
you
may
do
any
thing
with
him
.
  
<EOS>
I
could
not
bear
this
to
be
spoken
,
though
it
was
all
I
feared
of
a
long
time
;
and
began
to
exclaim
most
sadly
.
 
<EOS>
Nay
,
said
she
,
he
may
marry
you
,
as
far
as
I
know
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
no
,
said
I
,
that
can
not
be
.
 
<EOS>
I
neither
desire
nor
expect
it
.
 
<EOS>
His
condition
do
n't
permit
me
to
have
such
a
thought
;
and
that
,
and
the
whole
series
of
his
conduct
,
convinces
me
of
the
contrary
;
and
you
would
have
me
invite
him
to
come
down
,
would
you
?
 
<EOS>
Is
not
this
to
invite
my
ruin
?
  
<EOS>
@@@Tis
what
I
would
do
,
said
she
,
in
your
place
;
and
if
it
was
to
be
as
you
think
,
I
should
rather
be
out
of
my
pain
,
than
live
in
continual
frights
and
apprehensions
,
as
you
do
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
replied
I
,
an
hour
of
innocence
is
worth
an
age
of
guilt
;
and
were
my
life
to
be
made
ever
so
miserable
by
it
<EOS>
,
I
should
never
forgive
myself
,
if
I
were
not
to
lengthen
out
to
the
longest
minute
my
happy
time
of
honesty
.
 
<EOS>
Who
knows
what
Providence
may
do
for
me
!
  
<EOS>
Why
,
may
be
,
said
she
,
as
he
loves
you
<EOS>
so
well
,
you
may
prevail
upon
him
by
your
prayers
and
tears
;
and
for
that
reason
,
I
should
think
,
you
'd
better
let
him
come
down
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
said
I
,
I
will
write
him
a
letter
,
because
he
expects
an
answer
,
or
may
be
he
will
make
a
pretence
to
come
down
.
 
<EOS>
How
can
it
go
?
  
<EOS>
I
'll
take
care
of
that
,
said
she
;
it
is
in
my
instructions
.
 
<EOS>
Ay
,
thought
I
,
so
I
doubt
,
by
the
hint
Mr.
Williams
gave
me
about
the
post
-
house
.
  
<EOS>
The
gardener
coming
by
,
I
said
,
Mr.
Jacob
,
I
have
planted
a
few
beans
,
and
I
call
the
place
my
garden
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
just
by
the
door
out
<EOS>
yonder
:
<EOS>
I
'll
shew
it
you
;
pray
do
n't
dig
them
up
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
went
on
with
him
;
and
when
we
had
turned
the
alley
,
out
of
her
sight
and
were
near
the
place
said
I
,
<EOS>
Pray
step
to
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
and
ask
her
if
she
has
any
more
beans
for
me
to
plant
?
 
<EOS>
He
smiled
,
I
suppose
at
my
foolishness
;
and
I
popped
the
letter
under
the
mould
,
and
stepped
back
,
as
if
waiting
for
his
return
;
which
,
being
near
,
was
immediate
;
and
she
followed
him
.
 
<EOS>
What
should
I
do
with
beans
?
<EOS>
said
she
,
 
and
sadly
scared
me
;
for
she
whispered
me
,
I
am
afraid
of
some
fetch
!
 
<EOS>
You
do
n't
use
to
send
on
such
simple
errands
.
 
<EOS>
What
fetch
?
<EOS>
said
I
:
<EOS>
It
is
hard
I
can
neither
stir
,
nor
speak
,
but
I
must
be
suspected
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
said
she
,
my
master
writes
,
that
I
must
have
all
my
eyes
about
me
;
for
though
you
are
as
innocent
as
a
dove
,
yet
you
are
as
cunning
as
a
serpent
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
'll
forgive
you
,
if
you
cheat
me
.
  
<EOS>
Then
I
thought
of
my
money
,
and
could
have
called
her
names
<EOS>
,
had
I
dared
:
<EOS>
And
I
said
,
Pray
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
now
you
talk
of
forgiving
me
,
if
I
cheat
you
,
be
so
kind
as
to
pay
me
my
money
;
for
though
I
have
no
occasion
for
it
,
<EOS>
yet
I
know
you
was
but
in
jest
,
and
intended
to
give
it
me
again
.
<EOS>
You
shall
have
it
in
a
proper
time
,
said
she
;
but
,
indeed
,
I
was
in
earnest
to
get
it
out
of
your
hands
,
for
fear
you
should
make
an
ill
use
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
we
cavilled
upon
this
subject
as
we
walked
in
,
and
<EOS>
I
went
up
to
write
my
letter
to
my
master
;
and
,
as
I
intended
to
shew
it
her
<EOS>
,
I
resolved
to
write
accordingly
as
to
her
part
of
it
;
for
I
made
little
account
of
his
offer
of
Mrs.
Jervis
to
me
,
instead
of
this
wicked
woman
,
(
though
the
most
agreeable
thing
that
could
have
befallen
me
,
except
my
escape
from
hence
,
)
nor
indeed
any
thing
he
said
.
 
<EOS>
For
to
be
honourable
,
in
the
just
sense
of
the
word
,
he
need
not
have
caused
me
to
be
run
away
with
,
and
confined
as
I
am
.
 
<EOS>
I
wrote
as
follows
:
  
"
HONOURED
SIR
,
  
<EOS>
"
When
I
consider
how
easily
you
might
make
me
happy
,
since
all
I
desire
is
to
be
permitted
to
go
to
my
poor
father
and
mother
;
when
I
reflect
upon
your
former
proposal
to
me
in
relation
to
a
certain
person
,
not
one
word
of
which
is
now
mentioned
;
and
upon
my
being
in
that
strange
manner
run
away
with
,
and
still
kept
here
a
miserable
prisoner
;
do
you
think
,
sir
,
(
pardon
your
poor
servant
's
freedom
;
my
fears
make
me
bold
;
do
you
think
,
I
say
,
)
that
your
general
assurances
of
honour
to
me
,
can
have
the
effect
upon
me
,
that
,
were
it
not
for
these
things
,
all
your
words
ought
to
have
?
 
<EOS>
O
,
good
sir
!
<EOS>
I
too
much
apprehend
that
your
notions
of
honour
and
mine
are
very
different
from
one
another
:
<EOS>
and
I
have
no
other
hopes
<EOS>
but
in
your
continued
absence
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
have
any
proposals
to
make
me
,
that
are
consistent
with
your
honourable
professions
,
in
my
humble
sense
of
the
word
,
a
few
lines
will
communicate
them
to
me
,
and
I
will
return
such
an
answer
as
befits
me
.
 
<EOS>
But
<EOS>
,
oh
!
<EOS>
What
proposals
can
one
in
your
high
station
have
to
make
to
one
in
my
low
one
!
 
<EOS>
I
know
what
belongs
to
your
degree
too
well
,
to
imagine
,
that
any
thing
can
be
expected
but
sad
temptations
,
and
utter
distress
,
if
you
come
down
;
and
you
know
not
,
sir
,
when
I
am
made
desperate
,
what
the
wretched
Pamela
dares
to
do
!
  
<EOS>
"
Whatever
rashness
you
may
impute
to
me
,
I
can
not
help
it
;
but
I
wish
I
may
not
be
forced
upon
any
,
that
otherwise
would
never
enter
into
my
thoughts
.
 
<EOS>
Forgive
me
,
sir
,
my
plainness
;
I
should
be
loath
to
behave
to
my
master
unbecomingly
;
but
I
must
needs
say
,
sir
,
<EOS>
my
innocence
is
so
dear
to
me
,
that
all
other
considerations
are
,
and
,
I
hope
,
shall
ever
be
,
treated
by
me
as
niceties
,
that
ought
,
for
that
,
to
be
dispensed
with
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
mean
honourably
,
why
,
sir
,
should
you
not
let
me
know
it
plainly
?
 
<EOS>
Why
is
it
necessary
to
imprison
me
,
to
convince
me
of
it
?
 
<EOS>
And
why
must
I
be
close
watched
,
and
attended
,
hindered
from
stirring
out
,
from
speaking
to
any
body
,
from
going
so
much
as
to
church
to
pray
for
you
,
who
have
been
,
till
of
late
,
so
generous
a
benefactor
to
me
?
 
<EOS>
Why
,
sir
,
I
humbly
ask
,
why
all
this
,
if
you
mean
honourably
?
 
<EOS>
It
is
not
for
me
to
expostulate
so
freely
,
but
in
a
case
so
near
to
me
,
with
you
,
sir
,
so
greatly
my
superior
.
 
<EOS>
Pardon
me
<EOS>
,
I
hope
you
will
;
but
as
to
seeing
you
,
I
can
not
bear
the
dreadful
apprehension
.
 
<EOS>
Whatever
you
have
to
propose
,
whatever
you
intend
by
me
,
let
my
assent
be
that
of
a
free
person
,
mean
as
I
am
,
and
not
of
a
sordid
slave
,
who
is
to
be
threatened
and
frightened
into
a
compliance
with
measures
,
which
your
conduct
to
her
seems
to
imply
would
be
otherwise
abhorred
by
her
.
 
<EOS>
My
restraint
is
indeed
hard
upon
me
:
I
am
very
uneasy
under
it
.
 
<EOS>
Shorten
it
<EOS>
,
I
beseech
you
,
or
 
<EOS>
but
I
will
not
dare
to
say
more
,
than
that
I
am
                              
<EOS>
"
Your
greatly
oppressed
unhappy
servant
.
<EOS>
"
  
After
I
had
taken
a
copy
of
this
,
I
folded
it
up
;
and
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
coming
just
as
I
had
done
,
sat
down
by
me
;
and
said
,
when
she
saw
me
direct
it
,
I
wish
you
would
tell
me
if
you
have
taken
my
advice
,
and
consented
to
my
master
's
coming
down
.
 
<EOS>
If
it
will
oblige
you
,
said
I
,
I
will
read
it
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
good
,
said
she
;
then
I
'll
love
you
dearly
.
 
<EOS>
Said
I
<EOS>
,
Then
you
must
not
offer
to
alter
one
word
.
 
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
,
replied
she
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
read
it
to
her
,
and
she
praised
me
much
for
my
wording
it
;
but
said
she
thought
I
pushed
the
matter
very
close
;
and
it
would
better
bear
talking
of
,
than
writing
about
.
 
<EOS>
She
wanted
an
explanation
or
two
,
as
about
the
proposal
to
a
certain
person
;
but
I
said
,
she
must
take
it
as
she
heard
it
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
well
,
said
she
,
<EOS>
I
make
no
doubt
you
understand
one
another
,
and
will
do
so
more
and
more
.
 
<EOS>
I
sealed
up
the
letter
,
and
she
undertook
to
convey
it
.
  
<EOS>
Sunday
.
  
<EOS>
For
my
part
,
I
knew
it
in
vain
to
expect
to
have
leave
to
go
to
church
now
,
and
so
I
did
not
ask
;
and
<EOS>
I
was
the
more
indifferent
,
because
,
if
I
might
have
had
permission
,
the
sight
of
the
neighbouring
gentry
,
who
had
despised
my
sufferings
,
would
have
given
me
great
regret
and
sorrow
;
and
it
was
impossible
I
should
have
edified
under
any
doctrine
preached
by
Mr.
Peters
:
<EOS>
So
I
applied
myself
to
my
private
devotions
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Williams
came
yesterday
,
and
this
day
,
as
usual
,
and
took
my
letter
;
but
,
having
no
good
opportunity
,
we
avoided
one
another
's
conversation
,
and
kept
at
a
distance
:
<EOS>
But
I
was
concerned
I
had
not
the
key
;
for
I
would
not
have
lost
a
moment
in
that
case
,
had
I
been
he
,
and
he
I.
 
<EOS>
When
I
was
at
my
devotion
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
came
up
,
and
wanted
me
sadly
to
sing
her
a
psalm
,
as
she
had
often
on
common
days
importuned
me
for
a
song
upon
the
spinnet
:
<EOS>
but
I
declined
it
,
because
my
spirits
were
so
low
I
could
hardly
speak
,
nor
cared
to
be
spoken
to
;
but
when
she
was
gone
,
I
remembering
the
cxxxviith
psalm
to
be
a
little
touching
,
turned
to
it
,
and
took
the
liberty
to
alter
it
,
somewhat
nearer
to
my
case
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
I
did
not
sin
in
it
;
but
thus
I
turned
it
:
                
I.
    
<EOS>
When
sad
I
sat
in
B####n
Hall
,
    
All
guarded
round
about
,
  
And
thought
of
ev'ry
absent
friend
,
    
The
tears
for
grief
burst
out
.
               
<EOS>
II
.
    
<EOS>
My
joys
and
hopes
all
overthrown
,
    
<EOS>
My
heart
-
strings
almost
broke
,
  
Unfit
my
mind
for
melody
,
    
Much
more
to
bear
a
joke
.
              
<EOS>
III
.
    
<EOS>
Then
she
to
whom
I
pris'ner
was
,
    
Said
to
me
,
tauntingly
,
  
<EOS>
Now
cheer
your
heart
,
and
sing
a
song
    
And
tune
your
mind
to
joy
.
               
<EOS>
IV
.
    
<EOS>
Alas
!
<EOS>
said
I
,
how
can
I
frame
    
<EOS>
My
heavy
heart
to
sing
,
  
Or
tune
my
mind
,
while
thus
enthrall'd
    
<EOS>
By
such
a
wicked
thing
!
                
<EOS>
V.
    
<EOS>
But
yet
,
if
from
my
innocence
    
I
,
ev'n
in
thought
,
should
slide
,
  
<EOS>
Then
let
my
fingers
quite
forget
    
The
sweet
spinnet
to
guide
.
               
<EOS>
VI
.
    
<EOS>
And
let
my
tongue
within
my
mouth
    
Be
lock'd
<EOS>
for
ever
fast
,
  
If
I
rejoice
,
before
I
see
    
My
full
deliv'rance
past
.
              
<EOS>
VII
.
    
<EOS>
And
thou
,
Almighty
,
recompense
    
<EOS>
The
evils
I
endure
,
  
From
those
who
seek
my
sad
disgrace
,
    
So
causeless
,
to
procure
.
             
<EOS>

<EOS>
Remember
,
Lord
,
this
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
    
<EOS>
When
,
with
a
mighty
sound
,
  
She
cries
,
Down
with
her
chastity
,
    
Down
to
the
very
ground
!
               
<EOS>
IX

<EOS>
Ev'n
<EOS>
so
shalt
thou
,
O
wicked
one
!
    
<EOS>
At
length
to
shame
be
brought
,
  
<EOS>
And
happy
shall
all
those
be
<EOS>
call'd
    
<EOS>
That
my
deliv'rance
wrought
.

X.
    
Yea
,
blessed
shall
the
man
be
called
    
That
shames
thee
of
thy
evil

And
saves
me
from
thy
vile
attempts

And
thee

<EOS>
Monday
,
Tuesday
,
Wednesday
.
  
<EOS>
I
write
now
with
a
little
more
liking
,
though
less
opportunity
,
because
Mr.
Williams
has
got
a
large
parcel
of
my
papers
,
safe
in
his
hands
,
to
send
them
to
you
,
as
he
has
opportunity
;
so
I
am
not
quite
uselessly
employed
:
and
I
am
delivered
besides
,
from
the
fear
of
their
being
found
,
if
I
should
be
searched
,
or
discovered
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
permitted
to
take
an
airing
,
five
or
six
miles
,
with
Mrs.
Jewkes
:
<EOS>
But
,
though
I
know
not
the
reason
,
she
watches
me
more
closely
than
ever
;
so
that
we
have
discontinued
,
by
consent
,
for
these
three
days
,
the
sunflower
correspondence
.
  
<EOS>
The
poor
cook
-
maid
has
had
a
bad
mischance
;
for
she
has
been
hurt
much
by
a
bull
in
the
pasture
,
by
the
side
of
the
garden
,
not
far
from
the
back
-
door
.
<EOS>
Now
this
pasture
I
am
to
cross
,
which
is
about
half
a
mile
,
and
then
is
a
common
,
and
near
that
a
private
horse
-
road
,
where
I
hope
to
find
an
opportunity
for
escaping
,
as
soon
as
Mr.
Williams
can
get
me
a
horse
,
and
has
made
all
ready
for
me
:
for
he
has
got
me
the
key
,
which
he
put
under
the
mould
,
just
by
the
door
,
as
he
found
an
opportunity
to
hint
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
He
just
now
has
signified
,
that
the
gentleman
is
dead
,
whose
living
he
has
had
hope
of
;
and
he
came
pretendedly
to
tell
Mrs.
Jewkes
of
it
;
and
so
could
speak
this
to
her
before
me
.
 
<EOS>
She
wished
him
joy
.
 
<EOS>
See
what
the
world
is
!
 
<EOS>
One
man
's
death
is
another
man
's
joy
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
we
thrust
out
one
another
!
 
<EOS>
My
hard
case
makes
me
serious
.
 
<EOS>
He
found
means
to
slide
a
letter
into
my
hands
,
and
is
gone
away
<EOS>
:
He
looked
at
me
with
such
respect
and
solemness
at
parting
,
that
Mrs.
Jewkes
said
,
Why
,
madam
,
I
believe
our
young
parson
is
half
in
love
with
you
.
 
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
said
I
,
he
knows
better
.
 
<EOS>
Said
she
,
(
I
believe
to
sound
me
,
)
<EOS>
Why
,
I
ca
n't
see
you
can
either
of
you
do
better
;
and
I
have
lately
been
so
touched
for
you
,
seeing
how
heavily
you
apprehend
dishonour
from
my
master
<EOS>
,
that
I
think
it
is
pity
you
should
not
have
Mr.
Williams
.
  
<EOS>
I
knew
this
must
be
a
fetch
of
hers
;
because
,
instead
of
being
troubled
for
me
,
as
she
pretended
,
she
watched
me
closer
,
and
him
too
:
<EOS>
and
so
I
said
,
There
is
not
the
man
living
that
I
desire
to
marry
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
can
but
keep
myself
honest
,
it
is
all
my
desire
:
<EOS>
And
to
be
a
comfort
and
assistance
to
my
poor
parents
,
if
it
should
be
my
happy
lot
to
be
so
,
is
the
very
top
of
my
ambition
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
but
,
said
she
,
I
have
been
thinking
very
seriously
,
that
Mr.
Williams
would
make
you
a
good
husband
;
and
as
he
will
owe
all
his
fortune
to
my
master
,
he
will
be
very
glad
,
to
be
sure
,
to
be
obliged
to
him
for
a
wife
of
his
choosing
:
<EOS>
especially
,
said
she
,
such
a
pretty
one
,
and
one
so
ingenious
,
and
genteelly
educated
.
  
<EOS>
This
gave
me
a
doubt
,
whether
she
knew
of
my
master
's
intimation
of
that
sort
formerly
;
and
I
asked
her
,
if
she
had
reason
to
surmise
that
that
was
in
view
?
 
<EOS>
No
,
she
said
;
<EOS>
it
was
only
her
own
thought
;
but
it
was
very
likely
that
my
master
had
either
that
in
view
,
or
something
better
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
if
I
approved
of
it
,
she
would
propose
such
a
thing
to
her
master
directly
;
and
gave
a
detestable
hint
,
that
I
might
take
resolutions
upon
it
,
of
bringing
such
an
affair
to
effect
.
 
<EOS>
I
told
her
I
abhorred
her
vile
insinuation
;
and
as
to
Mr.
Williams
,
I
thought
him
a
civil
good
sort
of
man
;
but
,
as
on
one
side
,
he
was
above
me
;
so
,
on
the
other
,
I
said
of
all
things
I
did
not
love
a
parson
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
finding
she
could
make
nothing
of
me
,
she
quitted
the
subject
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
open
his
letter
by
and
by
,
and
give
you
the
contents
of
it
;
for
she
is
up
and
down
so
much
,
that
I
am
afraid
of
her
surprising
me
.
  
<EOS>
Well
,
I
see
Providence
has
not
abandoned
me
:
I
shall
be
under
no
necessity
to
make
advances
to
Mr.
Williams
,
if
I
was
(
as
I
am
sure
I
am
not
)
disposed
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
his
letter
:
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
not
how
to
express
myself
,
lest
I
should
appear
to
you
to
have
a
selfish
view
in
the
service
<EOS>
I
would
do
you
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
really
know
<EOS>
but
one
effectual
and
honourable
way
to
disengage
yourself
from
the
dangerous
situation
you
are
in
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
that
of
marriage
with
some
person
that
you
could
make
happy
in
your
approbation
.
 
<EOS>
As
for
my
own
part
,
it
would
be
,
as
things
stand
,
my
apparent
ruin
;
and
,
worse
<EOS>
still
,
I
should
involve
you
in
misery
too
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
yet
,
so
great
is
my
veneration
for
you
,
and
so
entire
my
reliance
on
Providence
,
upon
so
just
an
occasion
,
that
I
should
think
myself
but
too
happy
,
if
I
might
be
accepted
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
,
in
this
case
,
forego
all
my
expectations
,
and
be
your
conductor
to
some
safe
distance
.
 
<EOS>
But
why
do
I
say
,
in
this
case
?
 
<EOS>
That
I
will
do
,
whether
you
think
fit
to
reward
me
so
eminently
or
not
:
<EOS>
And
I
will
,
the
moment
I
hear
of
Mr.
B####"s
setting
out
,
(
<EOS>
and
I
think
now
I
have
settled
a
very
good
method
of
intelligence
of
all
his
motions
,
)
get
a
horse
ready
,
and
myself
to
conduct
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
refer
myself
wholly
to
your
goodness
and
direction
;
and
am
,
with
the
highest
respect
,
                             
"
Your
most
faithful
humble
servant
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
n't
think
this
a
sudden
resolution
.
 
<EOS>
I
always
admired
your
hear
-
say
character
;
and
the
moment
I
saw
you
,
wished
to
serve
so
much
excellence
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
What
shall
I
say
,
my
dear
father
and
mother
,
to
this
unexpected
declaration
?
 
<EOS>
I
want
,
now
,
more
than
ever
,
your
blessing
and
direction
.
<EOS>
But
,
after
all
,
I
have
no
mind
to
marry
;
I
had
rather
live
with
you
.
 
<EOS>
But
yet
,
I
would
marry
a
man
who
begs
from
door
to
door
,
and
has
no
home
nor
being
,
rather
than
endanger
my
honesty
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
I
can
not
,
methinks
,
hear
of
being
a
wife
.
 
<EOS>
After
a
thousand
different
thoughts
,
I
wrote
as
follows
:
  
"
REVEREND
SIR
,
  
"
I
am
greatly
confused
at
the
contents
of
your
last
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
much
too
generous
,
and
I
ca
n't
bear
you
should
risk
all
your
future
prospects
for
so
unworthy
a
creature
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
think
of
your
offer
without
equal
concern
and
gratitude
:
<EOS>
for
nothing
,
but
to
avoid
my
utter
ruin
,
can
make
me
think
of
a
change
of
condition
;
and
so
,
sir
,
you
ought
not
to
accept
of
such
an
involuntary
compliance
,
as
mine
would
be
,
were
I
,
upon
the
last
necessity
,
to
yield
to
your
very
generous
proposal
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
rely
wholly
upon
your
goodness
to
me
,
in
assisting
my
escape
;
but
shall
not
,
on
your
account
principally
,
think
of
the
honour
you
propose
for
me
at
present
;
and
never
,
but
at
the
pleasure
of
my
parents
;
who
,
poor
as
they
are
,
in
such
a
weighty
point
,
are
as
much
entitled
to
my
obedience
and
duty
,
as
if
they
were
ever
so
rich
.
 
<EOS>
I
beg
you
,
therefore
,
sir
,
not
to
think
of
any
thing
from
me
,
but
everlasting
gratitude
,
which
shall
always
bind
me
to
be

obliged

Thursday
,
Friday
,
Saturday
,
the
14th
,
15th
,
and
16th
,
of
my
bondage
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
has
received
a
letter
,
and
is
much
civiller
to
me
,
and
Mr.
Williams
too
,
than
she
used
to
be
.
 
<EOS>
I
wonder
I
have
not
one
in
answer
to
mine
to
my
master
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
I
put
the
matter
too
home
to
him
:
and
he
is
angry
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
the
more
pleased
with
her
civility
;
for
she
is
horrid
cunning
,
and
is
not
a
whit
less
watchful
.
 
<EOS>
I
laid
a
trap
to
get
at
her
instructions
,
which
she
carries
in
the
bosom
of
her
stays
;
but
it
has
not
succeeded
.
  
<EOS>
My
last
letter
is
come
safe
to
Mr.
Williams
by
the
old
conveyance
,
so
that
he
is
not
suspected
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
intimated
,
that
though
I
have
not
come
so
readily
as
he
hoped
into
his
scheme
,
yet
his
diligence
shall
not
be
slackened
,
and
he
will
leave
it
to
Providence
and
himself
to
dispose
of
him
as
he
shall
be
found
to
deserve
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
signified
to
me
,
that
he
shall
soon
send
a
special
messenger
with
the
packet
to
you
,
and
I
have
added
to
it
what
has
occurred
since
.
  
<EOS>
Sunday
.
  
<EOS>
I
am
just
now
quite
astonished
!
 
<EOS>
I
hope
all
is
right
!
 
<EOS>
but
I
have
a
strange
turn
to
acquaint
you
with
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Williams
and
Mrs.
Jewkes
came
to
me
both
together
;
he
in
ecstacies
,
she
with
a
strange
fluttering
sort
of
air
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
said
she
,
Mrs.
Pamela
,
I
give
you
joy
!
 
<EOS>
I
give
you
joy
!
 
<EOS>
Let
nobody
speak
but
me
!
 
<EOS>
Then
she
sat
down
,
as
out
of
breath
,
puffing
and
blowing
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
every
thing
turns
as
I
said
it
would
!
<EOS>
said
she
:
<EOS>
Why
,
there
is
to
be
a
match
between
you
and
Mr.
Williams
!
 
<EOS>
Well
,
I
always
thought
it
.
 
<EOS>
Never
was
so
good
a
master
!
 
<EOS>
Go
to
,
go
to
,
naughty
,
mistrustful
Mrs.
Pamela
;
nay
,
Mrs.
Williams
,
said
the
forward
creature
,
I
may
<EOS>
as
good
call
you
:
you
ought
on
your
knees
to
beg
his
pardon
a
thousand
times
for
mistrusting
him
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
going
on
;
but
I
said
,
Do
n't
torture
me
thus
,
I
beseech
you
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
.
 
<EOS>
Let
me
know
all
!
 
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
Mr.
Williams
,
said
I
,
take
care
,
take
care
!
 
<EOS>
Mistrustful
again
!
<EOS>
said
she
:
<EOS>
Why
,
Mr.
Williams
,
shew
her
your
letter
,
and
I
will
shew
her
mine
:
they
were
brought
by
the
same
hand
.
  
<EOS>
I
trembled
at
the
thoughts
of
what
this
might
mean
;
and
said
,
You
have
so
surprised
me
,
that
I
can
not
stand
,
nor
hear
,
nor
read
!
 
<EOS>
Why
did
you
come
up
in
such
a
manner
to
attack
such
weak
spirits
?
<EOS>
said
he
,
to
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
Shall
we
leave
our
letters
with
Mrs.
Pamela
,
and
let
her
recover
from
her
surprise
?
 
<EOS>
Ay
,
said
she
,
with
all
my
heart
;
here
is
nothing
but
flaming
honour
and
good
will
!
 
<EOS>
And
so
saying
,
they
left
me
their
letters
and
withdrew
.
  
<EOS>
My
heart
was
quite
sick
with
the
surprise
,
so
that
I
could
not
presently
read
them
,
notwithstanding
my
impatience
;
but
,
after
a
while
,
recovering
,
I
found
the
contents
thus
strange
and
unexpected
:
  
"
MR
.
<EOS>
WILLIAMS
,
  
<EOS>
"
The
death
of
Mr.
Fownes
has
now
given
me
the
opportunity
I
have
long
wanted
,
to
make
you
happy
,
and
that
in
a
double
respect
:
For
I
shall
soon
put
you
in
possession
of
his
living
;
and
,
if
you
have
the
art
of
making
yourself
well
received
,
of
one
of
the
loveliest
wives
in
England
.
 
<EOS>
She
has
not
been
used
(
as
she
has
reason
to
think
)
according
to
her
merit
;
but
when
she
finds
herself
under
the
protection
of
a
man
of
virtue
and
probity
,
and
a
happy
competency
to
support
life
in
the
manner
to
which
she
has
been
of
late
years
accustomed
,
I
am
persuaded
she
will
forgive
those
seeming
hardships
which
have
paved
the
way
to
so
happy
a
lot
,
as
I
hope
it
will
be
to
you
both
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
only
to
account
for
and
excuse
the
odd
conduct
I
have
been
guilty
of
,
which
I
shall
do
when
I
see
you
:
<EOS>
but
as
I
shall
soon
set
out
for
London
,
I
believe
it
will
not
be
yet
this
month
.
 
<EOS>
Mean
time
,
if
you
can
prevail
with
Pamela
,
you
need
not
suspend
for
that
your
mutual
happiness
;
only
let
me
have
notice
of
it
first
,
and
that
she
approves
of
it
;
which
ought
to
be
,
in
so
material
a
point
,
entirely
at
her
option
;
as
I
assure
you
,
on
the
other
hand
,
I
would
have
it
at
yours
,
that
nothing
may
be
wanting
to
complete
your
happiness
.
                                   
<EOS>
"
I
am
your
humble
servant

<EOS>

<EOS>
Was
ever
the
like
heard
?
 
<EOS>
Lie
still
,
my
throbbing
heart
,
divided
as
thou
art
,
between
thy
hopes
and
thy
fears
!
 
<EOS>
But
this
is
the
letter
Mrs.
Jewkes
left
with
me
:
  
"
MRS
.
JEWKES
,
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
been
very
careful
and
diligent
in
the
task
,
which
,
for
reasons
I
shall
hereafter
explain
,
I
had
imposed
upon
you
.
 
<EOS>
Your
trouble
is
now
almost
at
an
end
;
for
I
have
written
my
intentions
to
Mr.
Williams
so
particularly
,
<EOS>
that
I
need
say
the
less
here
,
because
he
will
not
scruple
,
I
believe
,
to
let
you
know
the
contents
of
my
letter
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
only
one
thing
to
mention
,
that
if
you
find
what
I
have
hinted
to
him
in
the
least
measure
disagreeable
to
either
,
you
assure
them
both
,
that
they
are
at
entire
liberty
to
pursue
their
own
inclinations
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
you
continue
your
civilities
to
the
mistrustful
,
uneasy
Pamela
,
who
now
will
begin
to
think
better
of
hers
and
                         
"
Your
friend

"
  
<EOS>
I
had
hardly
time
to
transcribe
these
letters
,
though
,
writing
so
much
,
I
write
pretty
fast
,
before
they
both
came
up
again
in
high
spirits
;
and
Mr.
Williams
said
,
I
am
glad
at
my
heart
,
madam
,
that
I
was
beforehand
in
my
declarations
to
you
:
<EOS>
this
generous
letter
has
made
me
the
happiest
man
on
earth
;
and
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
you
may
be
sure
,
that
if
I
can
procure
this
fair
one
's
consent
,
I
shall
think
myself
 
<EOS>
I
interrupted
the
good
man
,
and
said
,
Ah
!
<EOS>
Mr.
Williams
,
take
care
,
take
care
;
do
n't
let
 
There
I
stopt
;
and
Mrs.
Jewkes
said
,
Still
mistrustful
!
 
<EOS>
I
never
saw
the
like
in
my
life
!
 
<EOS>
But
I
see
,
said
she
,
I
was
not
wrong
,
while
my
old
orders
lasted
,
to
be
wary
of
you
both
 
<EOS>
I
should
have
had
a
hard
task
to
prevent
you
,
I
find
;
for
,
as
the
saying
is
,
Nought
can
restrain
consent
of
twain
.
  
<EOS>
I
doubted
not
her
taking
hold
of
his
joyful
indiscretion
.
 
<EOS>
I
took
her
letter
,
and
said
,
Here
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
is
yours
;
I
thank
you
for
it
;
but
I
have
been
so
long
in
a
maze
,
that
I
can
say
nothing
of
this
for
the
present
.
 
<EOS>
Time
will
bring
all
to
light
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
said
I
,
here
is
yours
:
May
every
thing
turn
to
your
happiness
!
 
<EOS>
I
give
you
joy
of
my
master
's
goodness
in
the
living
.
 
<EOS>
It
will
be
dying
,
said
he
,
not
a
living
,
without
you
.
 
<EOS>
Forbear
,
sir
,
said
I
;
while
I
have
a
father
and
mother
,
I
am
not
my
own
mistress
,
poor
as
they
are
;
and
I
'll
see
myself
quite
at
liberty
,
before
I
shall
think
myself
fit
to
make
a
choice
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
held
up
her
eyes
and
hands
,
and
said
,
Such
art
,
such
caution
,
such
cunning
,
for
thy
years
!
 
<EOS>
Well
!
 
<EOS>
Why
,
said
I
,
(
that
he
might
be
more
on
his
guard
,
though
I
hope
there
can
not
be
deceit
in
this
;
 
'
twould
be
strange
villany
,
and
that
is
a
hard
word
,
if
there
should
!
)
<EOS>
I
have
been
so
used
to
be
made
a
fool
of
by
fortune
,
that
I
hardly
can
tell
how
to
govern
myself
;
and
am
almost
an
infidel
as
to
mankind
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
hope
I
may
be
wrong
;
henceforth
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
you
shall
regulate
my
opinions
as
you
please
,
and
I
will
consult
you
in
every
thing
(
that
I
think
proper
,
<EOS>
said
I
to
myself
)
 
<EOS>
for
,
to
be
sure
,
though
I
may
forgive
her
,
I
can
never
love
her
.
  
<EOS>
She
left
Mr.
Williams
and
me
,
a
few
minutes
,
together
;
and
I
said
,
Consider
,
sir
,
consider
what
you
have
done
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
impossible
,
said
he
,
there
can
be
deceit
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
so
,
said
I
;
but
what
necessity
was
there
for
you
to
talk
of
your
former
declaration
?
 
<EOS>
Let
this
be
as
it
will
,
that
could
do
no
good
,
especially
before
this
woman
.
 
<EOS>
Forgive
me
,
sir
;
they
talk
of
women
's
promptness
of
speech
;
but
,
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
see
an
honest
heart
is
not
always
to
be
trusted
with
itself
in
bad
company
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
going
to
reply
,
but
though
her
task
is
said
to
be
ALMOST
<EOS>
(
I
took
notice
of
that
word
)
at
an
end
,
she
came
up
to
us
again
,
and
said
;
<EOS>
Well
,
I
had
a
good
mind
to
show
you
the
way
to
church
to
-
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
glad
of
this
,
because
,
though
in
my
present
doubtful
situation
I
should
not
have
chosen
it
,
yet
I
would
have
encouraged
her
proposal
,
to
be
able
to
judge
by
her
being
in
earnest
or
otherwise
,
whether
one
might
depend
upon
the
rest
.
 
<EOS>
But
Mr.
Williams
again
indiscreetly
helped
her
to
an
excuse
,
by
saying
,
that
it
was
now
best
to
defer
it
one
Sunday
,
and
till
matters
were
riper
for
my
appearance
:
and
she
readily
took
hold
of
it
,
and
confirmed
his
opinion
.
  
<EOS>
After
all
,
I
hope
the
best
:
but
if
this
should
turn
out
to
be
a
plot
,
I
fear
nothing
but
a
miracle
can
save
me
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
sure
the
heart
of
man
is
not
capable
of
such
black
deceit
.
 
<EOS>
Besides
,
Mr.
Williams
has
it
under
his
own
hand
,
and
he
dare
not
but
be
in
earnest
:
and
then
again
,
though
to
be
sure
he
has
been
very
wrong
to
me
,
yet
his
education
,
and
parents
'
example
,
have
neither
of
them
taught
him
such
very
black
contrivances
.
<EOS>
So
I
will
hope
for
the
best
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Williams
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
and
I
,
have
been
all
three
walking
together
in
the
garden
;
and
she
pulled
out
her
key
,
and
we
walked
a
little
in
the
pasture
to
look
at
the
bull
,
an
ugly
,
grim
,
surly
creature
,
that
hurt
the
poor
cook
-
maid
;
who
is
got
pretty
well
again
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Williams
pointed
at
the
sunflower
,
but
I
was
forced
to
be
very
reserved
to
him
;
for
the
poor
gentleman
has
no
guard
,
no
caution
at
all
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
just
supped
together
,
all
three
:
and
I
can
not
yet
think
that
all
must
be
right
.
 
<EOS>
Only
I
am
resolved
not
to
marry
,
if
I
can
help
it
;
and
I
will
give
no
encouragement
,
I
am
resolved
,
at
least
,
till
I
am
with
you
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Williams
said
,
before
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
he
would
send
a
messenger
with
a
letter
to
my
father
and
mother
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
the
man
has
no
discretion
in
the
world
:
<EOS>
but
l
desire
you
will
send
no
answer
,
till
I
have
the
pleasure
and
happiness
which
now
I
hope
for
soon
,
of
seeing
you
.
 
<EOS>
He
will
,
in
sending
my
packet
,
send
a
most
tedious
parcel
of
stuff
,
of
my
oppressions
,
my
distresses
,
my
fears
;
and
so
I
will
send
this
with
it
;
<EOS>
(
for
Mrs.
Jewkes
gives
me
leave
to
send
a
letter
to
my
father
,
which
looks
well
;
)
and
I
am
glad
I
can
conclude
,
after
all
my
sufferings
,
with
my
hopes
,
to
be
soon
with
you
,
which
I
know
will
give
you
comfort
;
and
so
I
rest
,
begging
the
continuance
of
your
prayers
and
blessings
,
                                     
Your
ever
dutiful
DAUGHTER
.
  
<EOS>
MY
DEAR
FATHER
AND
MOTHER
,
  
I
have
so
much
time
upon
my
hands
that
I
must
write
on
,
to
employ
myself
.
<EOS>
The
Sunday
evening
,
where
I
left
off
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
asked
me
,
If
I
chose
to
be
by
myself
;
I
said
,
Yes
,
with
all
my
heart
,
if
she
pleased
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
said
she
,
after
to
-
night
you
shall
.
 
<EOS>
I
asked
her
for
more
paper
;
and
she
gave
me
a
bottle
of
ink
,
eight
sheets
of
paper
,
which
she
said
was
all
her
store
,
(
for
now
she
would
get
me
to
write
for
her
to
our
master
,
if
she
had
occasion
,
)
and
six
pens
,
with
a
piece
of
sealing
wax
.
 
<EOS>
This
looks
mighty
well
.
  
<EOS>
She
pressed
me
,
when
she
came
to
bed
,
very
much
,
to
give
encouragement
to
Mr.
Williams
,
and
said
many
things
in
his
behalf
;
and
blamed
my
shyness
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
told
her
,
I
was
resolved
to
give
no
encouragement
,
till
I
had
talked
to
my
father
and
mother
.
 
<EOS>
She
said
,
he
fancied
I
thought
of
somebody
else
,
or
I
could
never
be
so
insensible
.
 
<EOS>
I
assured
her
,
as
I
could
do
very
safely
,
that
there
was
not
a
man
on
earth
I
wished
to
have
:
and
as
to
Mr.
Williams
,
he
might
do
better
by
far
:
and
I
had
proposed
so
much
happiness
in
living
with
my
poor
father
and
mother
,
that
I
could
not
think
of
any
scheme
of
life
with
pleasure
,
till
I
had
tried
that
.
 
<EOS>
I
asked
her
for
my
money
;
and
she
said
,
it
was
above
in
her
strong
box
,
but
that
I
should
have
it
to
-
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
All
these
things
look
well
,
as
I
said
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Williams
would
go
home
this
night
,
though
late
,
because
he
would
despatch
a
messenger
to
you
with
a
letter
he
had
proposed
from
himself
,
and
my
packet
.
 
<EOS>
But
pray
do
n't
encourage
him
,
as
I
said
;
for
he
is
much
too
heady
and
precipitate
as
to
this
matter
,
in
my
way
of
thinking
;
though
,
to
be
sure
,
he
is
a
very
good
man
,
and
I
am
much
obliged
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
Monday
morning
.
  
<EOS>
Alas
-
a
-
day
!
<EOS>
we
have
bad
news
from
poor
Mr.
Williams
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
had
a
sad
mischance
;
fallen
among
rogues
in
his
way
home
last
night
:
but
by
good
chance
has
saved
my
papers
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
the
account
he
gives
of
it
to
Mrs.
Jewkes
:
  
<EOS>
"
GOOD
<EOS>
MRS
.
JEWKES
,
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
had
a
sore
misfortune
in
going
from
you
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
had
got
as
near
the
town
as
the
dam
,
and
was
going
to
cross
the
wooden
bridge
,
two
fellows
got
hold
of
me
,
and
swore
bitterly
they
would
kill
me
,
if
I
did
not
give
them
what
I
had
.
 
<EOS>
They
rummaged
my
pockets
,
and
took
from
me
my
snuff
-
box
,
my
seal
-
ring
,
and
half
a
guinea
,
and
some
silver
,
and
halfpence
;
also
my
handkerchief
,
and
two
or
three
letters
I
had
in
my
pockets
.
 
<EOS>
By
good
fortune
,
the
letter
Mrs.
Pamela
gave
me
was
in
my
bosom
,
and
so
that
escaped
<EOS>
but
they
bruised
my
head
and
face
,
and
cursing
me
for
having
no
more
money
,
tipped
me
into
the
dam
,
crying
,
be
there
,
parson
,
till
to
-
morrow
!
 
<EOS>
My
shins
and
knees
were
bruised
much
in
the
fall
against
one
of
the
stumps
;
and
I
had
like
to
have
been
suffocated
in
water
and
mud
.
 
<EOS>
To
be
sure
,
I
sha
n't
be
able
to
stir
out
this
day
or
two
:
<EOS>
for
I
am
a
frightful
spectacle
!
 
<EOS>
My
hat
and
wig
<EOS>
I
was
forced
to
leave
behind
me
,
and
go
home
,
a
mile
and
a
half
,
without
;
but
they
were
found
next
morning
,
and
brought
me
,
with
my
snuff
-
box
,
which
the
rogues
must
have
dropped
.
 
<EOS>
My
cassock
is
sadly
torn
,
as
is
my
band
.
 
<EOS>
To
be
sure
,
I
was
much
frightened
,
for
a
robbery
in
these
parts
has
not
been
known
many
years
.
 
<EOS>
Diligent
search
is
making
after
the
rogues
.
 
<EOS>
My
humble
respects
to
good
Mrs.
Pamela
<EOS>
:
if
she
pities
my
misfortunes
,
I
shall
be
the
sooner
well
,
and
fit
to
wait
on
her
and
you
.
 
<EOS>
This
did
not
hinder
me
in
writing
a
letter
,
though
with
great
pain
,
as
I
do
this
,
(
<EOS>
To
be
sure
this
good
man
can
keep
no
secret
!
)
<EOS>
and
sending
it
away
by
a
man
and
horse
,
this
morning
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
,
<EOS>
good
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
                            
<EOS>
"
Your
most
obliged
humble
servant
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
God
be
praised
it
is
no
worse
!
 
<EOS>
And
I
find
I
have
got
no
cold
,
though
miserably
wet
from
top
to
toe
.
 
<EOS>
My
fright
,
I
believe
,
prevented
me
from
catching
cold
:
<EOS>
for
I
was
not
rightly
myself
for
some
hours
,
and
know
not
how
I
got
home
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
write
a
letter
of
thanks
this
night
,
if
I
am
able
,
to
my
kind
patron
,
for
his
inestimable
goodness
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
I
was
enabled
to
say
all
I
hope
,
with
regard
to
the
better
part
of
his
bounty
to
me
,
incomparable
Mrs.
Pamela
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
wicked
brute
fell
a
laughing
,
when
she
had
read
this
letter
,
till
her
fat
sides
shook
.
 
<EOS>
Said
she
<EOS>
,
I
can
but
think
how
the
poor
parson
looked
,
after
parting
with
his
pretty
mistress
in
such
high
spirits
,
when
he
found
himself
at
the
bottom
of
the
dam
!
 
<EOS>
And
what
a
figure
he
must
cut
in
his
tattered
band
and
cassock
,
and
without
a
hat
and
wig
,
when
he
got
home
.
 
<EOS>
I
warrant
,
added
she
<EOS>
,
he
was
in
a
sweet
pickle
!
 
<EOS>
I
said
,
<EOS>
I
thought
it
was
very
barbarous
to
laugh
at
such
a
misfortune
;
but
she
replied
,
As
he
was
safe
,
she
laughed
;
otherwise
she
would
have
been
sorry
:
and
she
was
glad
to
see
me
so
concerned
for
him
 
<EOS>
It
looked
promising
,
she
said
.
  
<EOS>
I
heeded
not
her
reflections
;
but
as
I
have
been
used
to
causes
for
mistrusts
,
I
can
not
help
saying
,
that
I
do
n't
like
this
thing
:
And
their
taking
his
letters
most
alarms
me
.
 
<EOS>
How
happy
it
was
they
missed
my
packet
!
 
<EOS>
I
knew
not
what
to
think
of
it
!
 
<EOS>
But
why
should
I
let
every
accident
break
my
peace
?
 
<EOS>
Yet
it
will
do
so
,
while
I
stay
here
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
is
mightily
at
me
,
to
go
with
her
in
the
chariot
,
to
visit
Mr.
Williams
.
 
<EOS>
She
is
so
officious
to
bring
on
the
affair
between
us
,
<EOS>
that
,
being
a
cunning
,
artful
woman
,
I
know
not
what
to
make
of
it
:
I
have
refused
her
absolutely
;
urging
,
that
except
I
intended
to
encourage
his
suit
,
I
ought
not
to
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
And
she
is
gone
without
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
strange
temptations
to
get
away
in
her
absence
,
for
all
these
fine
appearances
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
sad
to
have
nobody
to
advise
with
!
 
<EOS>
I
know
not
what
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
alas
for
me
!
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
money
,
if
I
should
,
to
buy
any
body
's
civilities
,
or
to
pay
for
necessaries
or
lodgings
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
'll
go
into
the
garden
,
and
resolve
afterwards
     
<EOS>
I
have
been
in
the
garden
,
and
to
the
back
-
door
:
<EOS>
and
there
I
stood
,
my
heart
up
at
my
mouth
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
see
I
was
watched
;
so
this
looks
well
.
<EOS>
But
if
any
thing
should
go
bad
afterwards
,
I
should
never
forgive
myself
,
for
not
taking
this
opportunity
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
I
will
go
down
again
,
and
see
if
all
is
clear
,
and
how
it
looks
out
at
the
back
-
door
in
the
pasture
.
  
<EOS>
To
be
sure
,
there
is
witchcraft
in
this
house
;
and
I
believe
Lucifer
is
bribed
,
as
well
as
all
about
me
,
and
is
got
into
the
shape
of
that
nasty
grim
bull
to
watch
me
!
 
<EOS>
For
I
have
been
again
,
and
ventured
to
open
the
door
,
and
went
out
about
a
bow
-
shot
into
the
pasture
;
but
there
stood
that
horrid
bull
,
staring
me
full
in
the
face
,
with
fiery
saucer
eyes
,
as
I
thought
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
got
in
again
,
<EOS>
for
fear
he
should
come
at
me
.
 
<EOS>
Nobody
saw
me
,
however
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
think
there
are
such
things
as
witches
and
spirits
?
<EOS>
If
there
be
,
I
believe
,
in
my
heart
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
has
got
this
bull
of
her
side
.
 
<EOS>
But
yet
,
what
could
I
do
without
money
,
or
a
friend
"
 
<EOS>
O
 
this
wicked
woman
!
<EOS>
to
trick
me
so
!
 
<EOS>
Every
thing
,
man
,
woman
,
and
beast
,
is
in
a
plot
against
your
poor
Pamela
,
I
think
!
 
<EOS>
Then
I
know
not
one
step
of
the
way
,
nor
how
far
to
any
house
or
cottage
;
and
whether
I
could
gain
protection
,
if
I
got
to
a
house
:
<EOS>
And
now
the
robbers
are
abroad
too
<EOS>
,
I
may
run
into
as
great
danger
as
I
want
to
escape
;
nay
,
greater
much
,
if
these
promising
appearances
hold
:
<EOS>
And
sure
my
master
can
not
be
so
black
as
that
they
should
not
!
 
<EOS>
What
can
I
do
?
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
good
mind
to
try
for
it
once
more
;
but
then
I
may
be
pursued
and
taken
:
and
it
will
be
worse
for
me
;
and
this
wicked
woman
will
beat
me
,
and
take
my
shoes
away
,
and
lock
me
up
.
  
<EOS>
But
,
after
all
,
if
my
master
should
mean
well
,
he
ca
n't
be
angry
at
my
fears
,
if
I
should
escape
;
and
nobody
can
blame
me
;
and
I
can
more
easily
be
induced
,
with
you
,
when
all
my
apprehensions
are
over
,
to
consider
his
proposal
of
Mr.
Williams
,
than
I
could
here
;
and
he
pretends
,
as
you
have
read
in
his
letter
,
he
will
leave
me
to
my
choice
:
Why
then
should
I
be
afraid
?
 
<EOS>
I
will
go
down
again
,
I
think
!
 
<EOS>
But
yet
my
heart
misgives
me
,
because
of
the
difficulties
before
me
,
in
escaping
;
and
being
so
poor
and
so
friendless
!
 
<EOS>
O
good
God
!
<EOS>
the
preserver
of
the
innocent
!
<EOS>
direct
me
what
to
do
!
  
<EOS>
Well
,
I
have
just
now
a
sort
of
strange
persuasion
upon
me
,
that
I
ought
to
try
to
get
way
,
and
leave
the
issue
to
Providence
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
once
more
 
I
'll
see
,
at
least
,
if
this
bull
be
still
there
.
  
<EOS>
Alack
-
a
-
day
!
<EOS>
what
a
fate
is
this
!
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
the
courage
to
go
,
neither
<EOS>
can
I
think
to
stay
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
must
resolve
.
 
<EOS>
The
gardener
was
in
sight
last
time
;
so
made
me
come
up
again
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
'll
contrive
to
send
him
out
of
the
way
,
if
I
can
:
 
<EOS>
For
if
I
never
should
have
such
another
opportunity
,
I
could
not
forgive
myself
.
 
<EOS>
Once
more
I
'll
venture
.
 
<EOS>
God
direct
my
footsteps
,
and
make
smooth
my
path
and
my
way
to
safety
!
  
<EOS>
Well
,
here
I
am
,
come
back
again
!
<EOS>
frightened
,
like
a
fool
,
out
of
all
my
purposes
!
 
<EOS>
O
how
terrible
every
thing
appears
to
me
!
 
<EOS>
I
had
got
twice
as
far
again
,
as
I
was
before
,
out
of
the
back
-
door
:
and
I
looked
and
saw
the
bull
,
as
I
thought
,
between
me
and
the
door
;
and
another
bull
coming
towards
me
the
other
way
<EOS>
:
Well
,
thought
I
,
here
is
double
witchcraft
,
to
be
sure
!
 
<EOS>
Here
is
the
spirit
of
my
master
in
one
bull
,
and
Mrs.
Jewkes
's
in
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
And
now
I
am
gone
,
to
be
sure
!
 
<EOS>
O
help
!
<EOS>
cried
I
,
like
a
fool
,
and
ran
back
to
the
door
,
as
swift
as
if
I
flew
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
had
got
the
door
in
my
hand
,
I
ventured
to
look
back
,
to
see
if
these
supposed
bulls
were
coming
;
and
I
saw
they
were
only
two
poor
cows
,
a
grazing
in
distant
places
,
that
my
fears
had
made
all
this
rout
about
.
 
<EOS>
But
as
every
thing
is
so
frightful
to
me
,
I
find
I
am
not
fit
to
think
of
my
escape
:
for
I
shall
be
as
much
frightened
at
the
first
strange
man
that
I
meet
with
:
and
I
am
persuaded
that
fear
brings
one
into
more
dangers
,
than
the
caution
,
that
goes
along
with
it
,
delivers
one
from
.
  
<EOS>
I
then
locked
the
door
,
and
put
the
key
in
my
pocket
,
and
was
in
a
sad
quandary
;
but
I
was
soon
determined
;
for
the
maid
Nan
came
in
sight
,
and
asked
,
if
any
thing
was
the
matter
,
that
I
was
so
often
up
and
down
stairs
?
 
<EOS>
God
forgive
me
,
(
but
I
had
a
sad
lie
at
my
tongue
's
end
,
)
<EOS>
said
I
;
Though
Mrs.
Jewkes
is
sometimes
a
little
hard
upon
me
,
yet
I
know
not
where
I
am
without
her
:
I
go
up
,
and
I
come
down
to
walk
about
in
the
garden
;
and
,
not
having
her
,
know
scarcely
what
to
do
with
myself
.
 
<EOS>
Ay
,
said
the
ideot
,
she
is
main
good
company
,
madam
,
no
wonder
you
miss
her
.
  
<EOS>
So
here
I
am
again
,
and
here
likely
to
be
;
for
I
have
no
courage
to
help
myself
any
where
else
.
 
<EOS>
O
why
are
poor
foolish
maidens
tried
with
such
dangers
,
when
they
have
such
weak
minds
to
grapple
with
them
!
 
<EOS>
I
will
,
since
it
is
so
,
hope
the
best
:
<EOS>
but
yet
I
can
not
but
observe
how
grievously
every
thing
makes
against
me
:
for
here
are
the
robbers
;
though
I
fell
not
into
their
hands
myself
,
yet
they
gave
me
as
much
terror
,
and
had
as
great
an
effect
upon
my
fears
,
as
if
I
had
:
<EOS>
And
here
is
the
bull
;
it
has
as
effectually
frightened
me
,
as
if
I
had
been
hurt
by
it
instead
of
the
cook
-
maid
;
and
so
these
joined
together
,
as
I
may
say
,
to
make
a
very
dastard
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
But
my
folly
was
the
worst
of
all
,
because
that
deprived
me
of
my
money
:
for
had
I
had
that
<EOS>
,
I
believe
I
should
have
ventured
both
the
bull
and
the
robbers
.
  
<EOS>
Monday
afternoon
.
  
<EOS>
So
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
is
returned
from
her
visit
:
Well
,
said
she
,
I
would
have
you
set
your
heart
at
rest
;
for
Mr.
Williams
will
do
very
well
again
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
not
half
so
bad
as
he
fancied
.
 
<EOS>
O
these
scholars
<EOS>
,
said
she
,
they
have
not
the
hearts
of
mice
!
 
<EOS>
He
has
only
a
few
scratches
on
his
face
;
which
,
said
she
,
I
suppose
he
got
by
grappling
among
the
gravel
at
the
bottom
of
the
dam
,
to
try
to
find
a
hole
in
the
ground
,
to
hide
himself
from
the
robbers
.
 
<EOS>
His
shin
and
his
knee
are
hardly
to
be
seen
to
ail
any
thing
.
<EOS>
He
says
in
his
letter
,
he
was
a
frightful
spectacle
:
<EOS>
He
might
be
so
,
indeed
,
when
he
first
came
in
a
doors
;
but
he
looks
well
enough
now
:
and
,
only
for
a
few
groans
now
<EOS>
and
then
,
when
he
thinks
of
his
danger
,
I
see
nothing
is
the
matter
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
Mrs.
Pamela
,
said
she
,
I
would
have
you
be
very
easy
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
glad
of
it
,
said
I
,
for
all
your
jokes
,
to
Mrs.
Jewkes
.
  
<EOS>
Well
,
said
she
,
he
talks
of
nothing
<EOS>
but
you
:
and
when
I
told
him
I
would
fain
have
persuaded
you
to
come
with
me
,
the
man
was
out
of
his
wits
with
his
gratitude
to
me
:
and
so
has
laid
open
all
his
heart
to
me
,
and
told
me
all
that
has
passed
,
and
was
contriving
between
you
two
.
 
<EOS>
This
alarmed
me
prodigiously
;
and
the
rather
,
as
I
saw
,
by
two
or
three
instances
,
that
his
honest
heart
could
keep
nothing
,
believing
every
one
as
undesigning
as
himself
.
 
<EOS>
I
said
,
<EOS>
but
yet
with
a
heavy
heart
,
Ah
!
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
this
might
have
done
with
me
,
had
he
had
any
thing
that
he
could
have
told
you
of
.
 
<EOS>
But
you
know
well
enough
,
that
had
we
been
disposed
,
we
had
no
opportunity
for
it
,
from
your
watchful
care
and
circumspection
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
said
she
,
that
's
very
true
,
Mrs.
Pamela
;
not
so
much
as
for
that
declaration
that
he
owned
before
me
<EOS>
,
he
had
found
opportunity
,
for
all
my
watchfulness
,
to
make
you
.
 
<EOS>
Come
,
come
,
said
she
,
no
more
of
these
shams
with
me
!
 
<EOS>
You
have
an
excellent
head
-
piece
for
your
years
;
but
may
be
I
am
as
cunning
as
you
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
said
she
,
<EOS>
all
is
well
now
;
because
my
watchments
are
now
over
,
by
my
master
's
direction
.
<EOS>
How
have
you
employed
yourself
in
my
absence
?
  
<EOS>
I
was
so
troubled
at
what
might
have
passed
between
Mr.
Williams
and
her
,
that
I
could
not
hide
it
;
and
she
said
,
Well
,
Mrs.
Pamela
,
since
all
matters
are
likely
to
be
so
soon
<EOS>
and
so
happily
ended
,
<EOS>
let
me
advise
you
to
be
a
little
less
concerned
at
his
discoveries
;
and
make
me
your
confidant
,
as
he
has
done
,
and
I
shall
think
you
have
some
favour
for
me
,
and
reliance
upon
me
;
and
perhaps
you
might
not
repent
it
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
so
earnest
,
that
I
mistrusted
she
did
this
to
pump
me
;
and
I
knew
how
,
now
,
to
account
for
her
kindness
to
Mr.
Williams
in
her
visit
to
him
;
which
was
only
to
get
out
of
him
what
she
could
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
said
I
,
is
all
this
fishing
about
for
something
,
where
there
is
nothing
,
if
there
be
an
end
of
your
watchments
,
as
you
call
them
?
 
<EOS>
Nothing
,
said
she
,
but
<EOS>
womanish
curiosity
,
I
'll
assure
you
;
for
one
is
naturally
led
to
find
out
matters
,
where
there
is
such
privacy
intended
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
said
I
,
pray
let
me
know
what
he
has
said
;
and
then
I
'll
give
you
an
answer
to
your
curiosity
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
care
,
said
she
,
whether
you
do
or
not
for
I
have
as
much
as
I
wanted
from
him
;
and
I
despair
of
getting
out
of
you
any
thing
you
ha'n't
a
mind
I
should
know
,
<EOS>
my
little
cunning
dear
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
said
I
,
let
him
have
said
what
he
would
,
I
care
not
:
for
I
am
sure
he
can
say
no
harm
of
me
;
and
so
let
us
change
the
talk
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
the
easier
,
indeed
,
because
,
for
all
her
pumps
,
she
gave
no
hints
of
the
key
and
the
door
,
etc
.
<EOS>
which
,
had
he
communicated
to
her
,
she
would
not
have
forborne
giving
me
a
touch
of
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
we
gave
up
one
another
,
as
despairing
to
gain
our
ends
of
each
other
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
am
sure
he
must
have
said
more
than
he
should
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
am
the
more
apprehensive
<EOS>
all
is
not
right
,
because
she
has
now
been
actually
,
these
two
hours
,
shut
up
a
writing
;
though
she
pretended
she
had
given
me
up
all
her
stores
of
papers
,
etc
.
<EOS>
and
that
I
should
write
for
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
begin
to
wish
I
had
ventured
every
thing
and
gone
off
,
when
I
might
.
 
<EOS>
O
when
will
this
state
of
doubt
and
uneasiness
end
!
  
<EOS>
She
has
just
been
with
me
,
and
says
she
shall
send
a
messenger
to
Bedfordshire
;
and
he
shall
carry
a
letter
of
thanks
for
me
,
if
I
will
write
it
for
my
master
's
favour
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
said
I
,
I
have
no
thanks
to
give
,
till
I
am
with
my
father
and
mother
:
and
besides
,
I
sent
a
letter
,
as
you
know
;
but
have
had
no
answer
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
She
said
,
she
thought
that
his
letter
to
Mr.
Williams
was
sufficient
;
and
the
least
I
could
do
was
to
thank
him
,
if
but
in
two
lines
.
 
<EOS>
No
need
of
it
,
said
I
;
for
I
do
n't
intend
to
have
Mr.
Williams
:
<EOS>
What
then
is
that
letter
to
me
?
 
<EOS>
Well
,
said
she
,
I
see
thou
art
quite
unfathomable
!
  
<EOS>
I
do
n't
like
all
this
.
 
<EOS>
O
my
foolish
fears
of
bulls
and
robbers
!
 
<EOS>
For
now
all
my
uneasiness
begins
to
double
upon
me
.
 
<EOS>
O
what
has
this
incautious
man
said
!
 
<EOS>
That
,
no
doubt
,
is
the
subject
of
her
long
letter
.
  
<EOS>
I
will
close
this
day
's
writing
,
with
just
saying
,
that
she
is
mighty
silent
and
reserved
,
to
what
she
was
:
and
says
nothing
but
No
,
or
<EOS>
Yes
,
to
what
I
ask
.
 
<EOS>
Something
must
be
hatching
,
I
doubt
!
 
<EOS>
I
the
rather
think
so
,
because
I
find
she
does
not
keep
her
word
with
me
,
about
lying
by
myself
,
and
my
money
;
to
both
which
points
she
returned
suspicious
answers
,
saying
,
as
to
the
one
,
Why
,
you
are
mighty
earnest
for
your
money
;
I
sha
n't
run
away
with
it
.
 
<EOS>
And
to
the
other
,
Good
-
lack
!
<EOS>
you
need
not
be
so
willing
,
as
I
know
of
,
to
part
with
me
for
a
bed
-
fellow
,
till
you
are
sure
of
one
you
like
better
.
 
<EOS>
This
cut
me
to
the
heart
;
and
,
at
the
same
time
,
stopped
my
mouth
.
  
<EOS>
Tuesday
,
Wednesday
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Williams
has
been
here
;
but
we
have
had
no
opportunity
to
talk
together
:
He
seemed
confounded
at
Mrs.
Jewkes
's
change
of
temper
,
and
reservedness
,
after
her
kind
visit
,
and
their
freedom
with
one
another
,
and
much
more
at
what
I
am
going
to
tell
you
.
 
<EOS>
He
asked
,
If
I
would
take
a
turn
in
the
garden
with
Mrs.
Jewkes
and
him
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
said
she
,
I
ca
n't
go
.
<EOS>
Said
he
,
May
not
Mrs.
Pamela
take
a
walk
?
 
<EOS>
No
,
said
she
<EOS>
;
I
desire
she
wo
n't
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
?
<EOS>
said
he
:
<EOS>
I
am
afraid
I
have
somehow
disobliged
you
.
 
<EOS>
Not
at
all
,
replied
she
;
but
I
suppose
you
will
soon
be
at
liberty
to
walk
together
as
much
as
you
please
:
and
I
have
sent
a
messenger
for
my
last
instructions
,
about
this
and
more
weighty
matters
;
and
when
they
come
I
shall
leave
you
to
do
as
you
both
will
;
but
,
till
then
,
it
is
no
matter
how
little
you
are
together
.
 
<EOS>
This
alarmed
us
both
;
and
<EOS>
he
seemed
quite
struck
of
a
heap
,
and
put
on
,
as
I
thought
,
a
self
-
accusing
countenance
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
went
behind
her
back
,
and
held
my
two
hands
together
,
flat
,
with
a
bit
of
paper
,
I
had
,
between
them
,
and
looked
at
him
:
and
he
seemed
to
take
me
as
I
intended
;
intimating
the
renewing
of
the
correspondence
by
the
tiles
.
  
<EOS>
I
left
them
both
together
,
and
retired
to
my
closet
to
write
a
letter
for
the
tiles
;
but
having
no
time
for
a
copy
,
I
will
give
you
the
substance
only
.
  
<EOS>
I
expostulated
with
him
on
his
too
great
openness
and
easiness
to
fall
into
Mrs.
Jewkes
's
snares
:
told
him
my
apprehensions
of
foul
play
;
and
gave
briefly
the
reasons
which
moved
me
:
begged
to
know
what
he
had
said
;
and
intimated
,
that
I
thought
there
was
the
highest
reason
to
resume
our
prospect
of
the
escape
by
the
back
-
door
.
 
<EOS>
I
put
this
in
the
usual
place
in
the
evening
;
and
now
wait
with
impatience
for
an
answer
.
  
<EOS>
Thursday
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
the
following
answer
:
  
"
<EOS>
DEAREST
MADAM
,
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
utterly
confounded
,
and
must
plead
guilty
to
all
your
just
reproaches
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
I
were
master
of
all
but
half
your
caution
and
discretion
!
 
<EOS>
I
hope
,
after
all
,
this
is
only
a
touch
of
this
ill
woman
's
temper
,
to
shew
her
power
and
importance
:
For
I
think
Mr.
B
#
#
#
#
neither
can
nor
dare
deceive
me
in
so
black
a
manner
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
expose
him
all
the
world
over
if
he
did
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
is
not
,
can
not
be
in
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
received
a
letter
from
John
Arnold
,
in
which
he
tells
me
,
that
his
master
is
preparing
for
his
London
journey
;
and
believes
,
afterwards
,
he
will
come
into
these
parts
:
<EOS>
But
he
says
,
Lady
Davers
is
at
their
house
,
and
is
to
accompany
her
brother
to
London
,
or
meet
him
there
,
he
knows
not
which
.
<EOS>
He
professes
great
zeal
and
affection
to
your
service
:
and
I
find
he
refers
to
a
letter
he
sent
me
before
,
but
which
is
not
come
to
my
hand
.
<EOS>
I
think
there
can
be
no
treachery
;
for
it
is
a
particular
friend
at
Gainsborough
,
that
I
have
ordered
him
to
direct
to
;
and
this
is
come
safe
to
my
hands
by
this
means
;
for
well
<EOS>
I
know
,
I
durst
trust
nothing
to
Brett
,
at
the
post
-
house
here
.
 
<EOS>
This
gives
me
a
little
pain
;
but
I
hope
all
will
end
well
,
and
we
shall
soon
hear
,
if
it
be
necessary
to
pursue
our
former
intentions
.
 
<EOS>
If
it
be
,
I
will
lose
no
time
to
provide
a
horse
for
you
,
and
another
for
myself
;
for
I
can
never
do
either
God
or
myself
better
service
,
though
I
were
to
forego
all
my
expectations
for
it
here
,
I
am
                        
"
Your
most
faithful
humble
servant
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
too
free
indeed
with
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
led
to
it
by
her
dissimulation
,
and
by
her
pretended
concern
to
make
me
happy
with
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
hinted
,
that
I
would
not
have
scrupled
to
have
procured
your
deliverance
by
any
means
;
and
that
I
had
proposed
to
you
,
as
the
only
honourable
one
,
marriage
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
assured
her
,
though
she
would
hardly
believe
me
,
that
you
discouraged
my
application
:
which
is
too
true
!
 
<EOS>
But
not
a
word
of
the
back
-
door
key
,
etc
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
continues
still
sullen
and
ill
-
natured
,
and
I
am
almost
afraid
to
speak
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
watches
me
as
close
as
ever
,
and
pretends
to
wonder
why
I
shun
her
company
as
I
do
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
just
put
under
the
tiles
these
lines
inspired
by
my
fears
,
which
are
indeed
very
strong
;
and
,
I
doubt
,
not
without
reason
.
  
<EOS>
"
SIR
,
  
"
Every
thing
gives
me
additional
disturbance
.
 
<EOS>
The
missed
letter
of
John
Arnold
's
makes
me
suspect
a
plot
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
am
I
loath
to
think
myself
of
so
much
importance
,
as
to
suppose
every
one
in
a
plot
against
me
.
 
<EOS>
Are
you
sure
,
however
,
the
London
journey
is
not
to
be
a
Lincolnshire
one
?
 
<EOS>
May
not
John
,
who
has
been
once
a
traitor
,
be
so
again
?
 
<EOS>
Why
need
I
be
thus
in
doubt
?
 
<EOS>
If
I
could
have
this
horse
,
I
would
turn
the
reins
on
his
neck
,
and
trust
to
Providence
to
guide
him
for
my
safeguard
!
 
<EOS>
For
I
would
not
endanger
you
,
now
just
upon
the
edge
of
your
preferment
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
,
sir
,
I
fear
your
fatal
openness
will
make
you
suspected
as
accessary
,
let
us
be
ever
so
cautious
.
  
<EOS>
"
Were
my
life
in
question
,
instead
of
my
honesty
,
I
would
not
wish
to
involve
you
,
or
any
body
,
in
the
least
difficulty
,
for
so
worthless
a
poor
creature
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
O
sir
!
<EOS>
my
soul
is
of
equal
importance
with
the
soul
of
a
princess
;
though
my
quality
is
inferior
to
that
of
the
meanest
slave
.
  
<EOS>
"
Save
then
my
innocence
,
good
Heaven
!
<EOS>
and
preserve
my
mind
spotless
;
and
happy
<EOS>
shall
I
be
to
lay
down
my
worthless
life
;
and
see
an
end
to
all
my
troubles
and
anxieties
.
  
<EOS>
"
Forgive
my
impatience
:
<EOS>
But
my
presaging
mind
bodes
horrid
mischiefs
!
<EOS>
Every
thing
looks
dark
around
me
;
and
this
woman
's
impenetrable
sullenness
and
silence
,
without
any
apparent
reason
,
from
a
conduct
so
very
contrary
,
bid
me
fear
the
worst
.
 
<EOS>
blame
me
,
sir
,
if
you
think
me
wrong
;
and
let
me
have
your
advice
what
to
do
;
which
will
oblige
                                        
"
Your
most
afflicted
servant

<EOS>
Friday
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
this
half
-
angry
answer
;
but
,
what
is
more
to
me
than
all
the
letters
in
the
world
could
be
,
yours
,
my
dear
father
,
enclosed
.
  
<EOS>
"
MADAM
,
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
are
too
apprehensive
by
much
;
I
am
sorry
for
your
uneasiness
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
depend
upon
me
,
and
all
I
can
do
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
make
no
doubt
of
the
London
journey
,
nor
of
John
's
contrition
and
fidelity
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
just
received
,
from
my
Gainsborough
friend
,
this
letter
,
as
I
suppose
,
from
your
good
father
,
in
a
cover
,
directed
for
me
,
as
I
had
desired
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
it
contains
nothing
to
add
to
your
uneasiness
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
,
dearest
madam
,
lay
aside
your
fears
,
and
wait
a
few
days
for
the
issue
of
Mrs.
Jewkes
's
letter
,

mine
of
thanks

Mr.

<EOS>
Things
,
I
hope
,
must
be
better
than
you
expect
.
 
<EOS>
Providence
will
not
desert
such
piety
and
innocence
:
and
be
this
your
comfort
and
reliance
:
<EOS>
Which
is
the
best
advice
that
can
at
present
be
given

The
father
's
letter
was
as
follows
:
  
<EOS>
"
My
DEAREST
DAUGHTER
,
  
"
Our
prayers
are
at
length
heard
,
and
we
are
overwhelmed
with
joy
.
 
<EOS>
O
what
sufferings
,
what
trials
,
hast
thou
gone
through
!
 
<EOS>
Blessed
be
the
Divine
goodness
,
which
has
enabled
thee
to
withstand
so
many
temptations
!
<EOS>
We
have
not
yet
had
leisure
to
read
through
your
long
accounts
of
all
your
hardships
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
long
,
because
I
wonder
how
you
could
find
time
and
opportunity
for
them
:
<EOS>
but
otherwise
they
are
the
delight
of
our
spare
hours
;
and
we
shall
read
them
over
and
over
,
as
long
as
we
live
,
with
thankfulness
to
God
,
who
has
given
us
so
virtuous
and
so
discreet
a
daughter
.
 
<EOS>
How
happy
is
our
lot
in
the
midst
of
our
poverty
!
 
<EOS>
O
let
none
ever
think
children
a
burden
to
them
;
when
the
poorest
circumstances
can
produce
so
much
riches
in
a
Pamela
!
 
<EOS>
Persist
,
my
dear
daughter
,
in
the
same
excellent
course
;
and
we
shall
not
envy
the
highest
estate
,
but
defy
them
to
produce
such
a
daughter
as
ours
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
said
,
we
had
not
read
through
all
yours
in
course
.
 
<EOS>
We
were
too
impatient
,
and
so
turned
to
the
end
;
where
we
find
your
virtue
within
view
of
its
reward
,
and
your
master
's
heart
turned
to
see
the
folly
of
his
ways
,
and
the
injury
he
had
intended
to
our
dear
child
:
For
,
to
be
sure
,
my
dear
,
he
would
have
ruined
you
,
if
he
could
.
 
<EOS>
But
seeing
your
virtue
,
his
heart
is
touched
;
and
he
has
,
no
doubt
,
been
awakened
by
your
good
example
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
do
n't
see
that
you
can
do
any
way
<EOS>
so
well
,
as
to
come
into
the
present
proposal
,
and
make
Mr.
Williams
,
the
worthy
Mr.
Williams
!
<EOS>
God
bless
him
!
 
<EOS>
happy
.
 
<EOS>
And
though
we
are
poor
,
and
can
add
no
merit
,
no
reputation
,
no
fortune
,
to
our
dear
child
,
but
rather
must
be
a
disgrace
to
her
,
as
the
world
will
think
;
yet
I
hope
I
do
not
sin
in
my
pride
,
to
say
,
that
there
is
no
good
man
,
of
a
common
degree
,
(
especially
as
your
late
lady
's
kindness
gave
you
such
good
opportunities
,
which
you
have
had
the
grace
to
improve
,
)
but
may
think
himself
happy
in
you
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
as
you
say
,
you
had
rather
not
marry
at
present
,
far
be
it
from
us
to
offer
violence
to
your
inclination
!
 
<EOS>
So
much
prudence
as
you
have
shewn
in
all
your
conduct
,
would
make
it
very
wrong
in
us
to
mistrust
it
in
this
,
or
to
offer
to
direct
you
in
your
choice
.
 
<EOS>
Rut
,
alas
!
<EOS>
my
child
,
what
can
we
do
for
you
?
 
<EOS>
To
partake
our
hard
lot
,
and
involve
yourself
into
as
hard
a
life
,
would
not
help
us
,
but
add
to
your
afflictions
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
will
be
time
enough
to
talk
of
these
things
,
when
we
have
the
pleasure
you
now
put
us
in
hope
of
,
of
seeing
you
with
us
;
which
God
grant
.
 
<EOS>
Amen
,
amen
,
say
                         
"
Your
most
indulgent
parents

<EOS>
Amen

"
Our
humblest
service
and
thanks
to
the
worthy
Mr.
Williams

<EOS>
Again
we
say
,
God
bless
him
for
ever

<EOS>
"
O
what
a
deal
we
have
to
say
to
you
!
 
<EOS>
God
give
us
a
happy
meeting
!
 
<EOS>
We
understand
the
"
squire
is
setting
out
for
London
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
a
fine
gentleman
,
and
has
wit
at
will
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
he
was
as
good
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
hope
he
will
now
reform
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
O
what
inexpressible
comfort
,
my
dear
father
,
has
your
letter
given
me
!
  
<EOS>
You
ask
,
What
can
you
do
for
me
?
 
<EOS>
What
is
it
<EOS>
you
can
not
do
for
your
child
!
 
<EOS>
You
can
give
her
the
advice
she
has
so
much
wanted
,
and
still
wants
,
and
will
always
want
:
You
can
confirm
her
in
the
paths
of
virtue
,
into
which
you
first
initiated
her
;
and
you
can
pray
for
her
,
with
hearts
so
sincere
and
pure
,
that
are
not
to
be
met
with
in
palaces
!
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
how
I
long
to
throw
myself
at
your
feet
,
and
receive
from
your
own
lips
the
blessings
of
such
good
parents
!
 
<EOS>
But
,
alas
!
<EOS>
how
are
my
prospects
again
overclouded
,
to
what
they
were
when
I
closed
my
last
parcel
!
 
<EOS>
More
trials
,
more
dangers
,
I
fear
,
must
your
poor
Pamela
be
engaged
in
:
<EOS>
But
through
the
Divine
goodness
,
and
your
prayers
,
I
hope
,
at
last
,
to
get
well
out
of
all
my
difficulties
;
and
the
rather
,
as
they
are
not
the
effect
of
my
own
vanity
or
presumption
!
  
<EOS>
But
I
will
proceed
with
my
hopeless
story
.
 
<EOS>
I
saw
Mr.
Williams
was
a
little
nettled
at
my
impatience
;
and
so
I
wrote
to
assure
him
I
would
be
as
easy
as
I
could
,
and
wholly
directed
by
him
;
especially
as
my
father
,
whose
respects
I
mentioned
,
had
assured
me
my
master
was
setting
out
for
London
,
which
he
must
have
somehow
from
his
own
family
or
he
would
not
have
written
me
word
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
Saturday
,
Sunday
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Williams
has
been
here
both
these
days
,
as
usual
;
but
is
very
indifferently
received
still
by
Mrs.
Jewkes
;
and
,
to
avoid
suspicion
,
I
left
them
together
,
and
went
up
to
my
closet
,
most
of
the
time
he
was
here
.
 
<EOS>
He
and
she
<EOS>
,
I
found
by
her
,
had
a
quarrel
:
and
she
seems
quite
out
of
humour
with
him
:
<EOS>
but
I
thought
it
best
not
to
say
any
thing
:
and
he
said
,
he
would
very
little
trouble
<EOS>
the
house
till
he
had
an
answer
to
his
letter
from
Mr.
B
#
#
#
#
.
 
<EOS>
And
she
returned
,
The
less
,
the
better
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
man
!
<EOS>
he
has
got
but
little
by
his
openness
,
making
Mrs.
Jewkes
his
confidant
,
as
she
bragged
,
and
would
have
had
me
to
do
likewise
.
  
<EOS>
I
am
more
and
more
satisfied
there
is
mischief
brewing
;
and
shall
begin
to
hide
my
papers
,
and
be
circumspect
.
 
<EOS>
She
seems
mighty
impatient
for
an
answer
to
her
letter
to
my
master
.
  
<EOS>
Monday
,
Tuesday
,
the
25th
and
26th
days
of
my
heavy
restraint
.
  
<EOS>
Still
more
and
more
strange
things
to
write
!
 
<EOS>
A
messenger
is
returned
,
and
now
all
is
out
!
 
<EOS>
O
wretched
,
wretched
Pamela
!
 
<EOS>
What
,
at
last
,
will
become
of
me
!
 
<EOS>
Such
strange
turns
and
trials
<EOS>
sure
never
poor
creature
,
of
my
years
,
experienced
.
 
<EOS>
He
brought
two
letters
,
one
to
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
and
one
to
me
:
<EOS>
but
,
as
the
greatest
wits
may
be
sometimes
mistaken
,
they
being
folded
and
sealed
alike
,
that
for
me
was
directed
to
Mrs.
Jewkes
;
and
that
for
her
was
directed
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
But
both
are
stark
naught
,
abominably
bad
!
 
<EOS>
She
brought
me
up
<EOS>
that
directed
for
me
,
and
said
,
<EOS>
Here
's
a
letter
for
you
:
Long
-
looked
-
for
is
come
at
last
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
ask
the
messenger
a
few
questions
,
and
then
I
will
read
mine
.
 
<EOS>
So
she
went
down
,
and
I
broke
it
open
in
my
closet
,
and
found
it
directed
To
MRS
.
<EOS>
PAMELA
ANDREWS
.
 
<EOS>
But
when
I
opened
it
,
it
began
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
quite
confounded
;
but
,
thought
I
<EOS>
,
this
may
be
a
lucky
mistake
;
I
may
discover
something
:
<EOS>
And
so
I
read
on
these
horrid
contents
:
  
"
MRS
.
JEWKES
,
  
<EOS>
"
What
you
write
me
,
has
given
me
no
small
disturbance
.
 
<EOS>
This
wretched
fool
's
play
-
thing
,
no
doubt
,
is
ready
to
leap
at
any
thing
that
offers
,
rather
than
express
the
least
sense
of
gratitude
for
all
the
benefits
she
has
received
from
my
family
,
and
which
I
was
determined
more
and
more
to
heap
upon
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
reserve
her
for
my
future
resentment
;
and
I
charge
you
double
your
diligence
in
watching
her
,
to
prevent
her
escape
.
 
<EOS>
I
send
this
by
an
honest
Swiss
,
who
attended
me
in
my
travels
;
a
man
I
can
trust
;
and
so
let
him
be
your
assistant
:
for
the
artful
creature
is
enough
to
corrupt
a
nation
by
her
seeming
innocence
and
simplicity
;
and
she
may
have
got
a
party
,
perhaps
,
among
my
servants
with
you
,
as
she
has
here
.
 
<EOS>
Even
John
Arnold
,
whom
I
confided
in
,
and
favoured
more
than
any
,
has
proved
an
execrable
villain
;
and
shall
meet
his
reward
for
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
to
that
college
novice
,
Williams
,
I
need
not
bid
you
take
care
<EOS>
he
sees
not
this
painted
bauble
:
for
I
have
ordered
Mr.
Shorter
,
my
attorney
,
to
throw
him
instantly
into
gaol
,
on
an
action
of
debt
,
for
money
he
has
had
of
me
,
which
I
had
intended
never
to
carry
to
account
against
him
;
for
I
know
all
his
rascally
practices
,
besides
what
you
write
me
of
his
perfidious
intrigue
with
that
girl
,
and
his
acknowledged
contrivances
for
her
escape
;
when
he
knew
not
,
for
certain
,
that
I
designed
her
any
mischief
;
and
when
,
if
he
had
been
guided
by
a
sense
of
piety
,
or
compassion
for
injured
innocence
,
as
he
pretends
,
he
would
have
expostulated
with
me
,
as
his
function
,
and
my
friendship
for
him
,
might
have
allowed
him
.
 
<EOS>
But
to
enter
into
a
vile
intrigue
with
the
amiable
gewgaw
,
to
favour
her
escape
in
so
base
a
manner
,
(
to
say
nothing
of
his
disgraceful
practices
against
me
,
in
Sir
Simon
Darnford
's
family
,
of
which
Sir
Simon
himself
has
informed
me
)
,
is
a
conduct
that
,
instead
of
preferring
the
ungrateful
wretch
,
as
I
had
intended
,
shall
pull
down
upon
him
utter
ruin
.
  
<EOS>
"
Monsieur
Colbrand
,
my
trusty
Swiss
,
will
obey
you
without
reserve
,
if
my
other
servants
refuse
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
for
her
denying
that
she
encouraged
his
declaration
,
I
believe
it
not
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
certain
the
speaking
picture
,
with
all
that
pretended
innocence
and
bashfulness
,
would
have
run
away
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
she
would
run
away
with
a
fellow
that
she
had
been
acquainted
with
(
and
that
not
intimately
,
if
you
were
as
careful
as
you
ought
to
be
)
but
a
few
days
;
at
a
time
when
she
had
the
strongest
assurances
of
my
honour
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
think
,
I
now
hate
her
perfectly
:
and
though
I
will
do
nothing
to
her
myself
,
yet
I
can
bear
,
for
the
sake
of
my
revenge
,
and
my
injured
honour
and
slighted
love
,
to
see
any
thing
,
even
what
she
most
fears
,
be
done
to
her
;
and
then
she
may
be
turned
loose
to
her
evil
destiny
,
and
echo
to
the
woods
and
groves
her
piteous
lamentations
for
the
loss
of
her
fantastical
innocence
,
which
the
romantic
ideot
makes
such
a
work
about
.
<EOS>
I
shall
go
to
London
,
with
my
sister
Davers
;
and
the
moment
I
can
disengage
myself
,
which
,
perhaps
,
may
be
in
three
weeks
from
this
time
,
I
will
be
with
you
,
and
decide
her
fate
,
and
put
an
end
to
your
trouble
.
<EOS>
Mean
time
be
doubly
careful
;
for
this
innocent
,
as
I
have
warned
you
,
is
full
of
contrivances
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
                     
"
Your
friend
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
had
but
just
read
this
dreadful
letter
through
,
when
Mrs.
Jewkes
came
up
in
a
great
fright
,
guessing
at
the
mistake
,
and
that
I
had
her
letter
,
and
she
found
me
with
it
open
in
my
hand
,
just
sinking
away
.
 
<EOS>
What
business
,
said
she
,
had
you
to
read
my
letter
?
<EOS>
and
snatched
it
from
me
.
<EOS>
You
see
,
said
she
,
looking
upon
it
,
it
says
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
at
top
:
<EOS>
You
ought
,
in
manners
,
to
have
read
no
further
.
 
<EOS>
O
add
not
,
said
I
,
to
my
afflictions
!
 
<EOS>
I
shall
be
soon
out
of
all
your
ways
!
 
<EOS>
This
is
too
much
!
<EOS>
too
much
!
 
<EOS>
I
never
can
support
this
 
and
threw
myself
upon
the
couch
,
in
my
closet
,
and
wept
most
bitterly
.
 
<EOS>
She
read
it
in
the
next
room
,
and
came
in
again
afterwards
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
this
,
said
she
,
is
a
sad
letter
indeed
:
<EOS>
I
am
sorry
for
it
:
<EOS>
But
I
feared
you
would
carry
your
niceties
too
far
!
  
<EOS>
Leave
me
,
leave
me
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
said
I
,
for
a
while
:
I
can
not
speak
nor
talk
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
heart
!
<EOS>
said
she
;
<EOS>
Well
,
I
'll
come
up
again
presently
,
and
hope
to
find
you
better
.
 
<EOS>
But
here
,
take
your
own
letter
;
I
wish
you
well
;
but
this
is
a
sad
mistake
!
 
<EOS>
And
so
she
put
down
by
me
that
which
was
intended
for
me
:
<EOS>
But
I
have
no
spirit
to
read
it
at
present
.
 
<EOS>
O
man
!
<EOS>
man
!
<EOS>
hard
-
hearted
,
cruel
man
!
<EOS>
what
mischiefs
art
thou
not
capable
of
,
unrelenting
persecutor
as
thou
art
!
  
<EOS>
I
sat
ruminating
,
when
I
had
a
little
come
to
myself
,
upon
the
terms
of
this
wicked
letter
;
and
had
no
inclination
to
look
into
my
own
.
 
<EOS>
The
bad
names
,
fool
's
play
-
thing
,
artful
creature
,
painted
bauble
,
gewgaw
,
speaking
picture
,
are
hard
words
for
your
poor
Pamela
!
<EOS>
and
I
began
to
think
whether
I
was
not
indeed
a
very
naughty
body
,
and
had
not
done
vile
things
:
<EOS>
But
when
I
thought
of
his
having
discovered
poor
John
,
and
of
Sir
Simon
's
base
officiousness
,
in
telling
him
of
Mr.
Williams
,
with
what
he
had
resolved
against
him
in
revenge
for
his
goodness
to
me
,
I
was
quite
dispirited
;
and
yet
still
more
about
that
fearful
Colbrand
,
and
what
he
could
see
done
to
me
:
for
then
I
was
ready
to
gasp
for
breath
,
and
my
heart
quite
failed
me
.
 
<EOS>
Then
how
dreadful
are
the
words
,
that
he
will
decide
my
fate
in
three
weeks
!
 
<EOS>
Gracious
Heaven
,
said
I
,
strike
me
dead
,
before
that
time
,
with
a
thunderbolt
,
or
provide
some
way
for
my
escaping
these
threatened
mischiefs
!
 
<EOS>
God
forgive
me
,
if
I
sinned
!
  
<EOS>
At
last
,
I
took
up
the
letter
directed
for
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
but
designed
for
me
;
and
I
find
that
little
better
than
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
These
are
the
hard
terms
it
contains
:
  
<EOS>
"
Well
have
you
done
,
perverse
,
forward
,
artful
,
yet
foolish
Pamela
,
to
convince
me
,
before
it
was
too
late
,
how
ill
I
had
done
to
place
my
affections
on
so
unworthy
an
object
:
I
had
vowed
honour
and
love
to
your
unworthiness
,
believing
you
a
mirror
of
bashful
modesty
and
unspotted
innocence
;
and
that
no
perfidious
designs
lurked
in
so
fair
a
bosom
.
 
<EOS>
But
now
I
have
found
you
out
,
<EOS>
you
specious
hypocrite
!
<EOS>
and
I
see
,
that
though
you
could
not
repose
the
least
confidence
in
one
you
had
known
for
years
,
and
who
,
under
my
good
mother
's
misplaced
favour
for
you
,
had
grown
up
in
a
manner
with
you
;
when
my
passion
,
in
spite
of
my
pride
,
and
the
difference
of
our
condition
,
made
me
stoop
to
a
meanness
that
now
I
despise
myself
for
;
yet
you
could
enter
into
an
intrigue
with
a
man
you
never
knew
till
within
these
few
days
past
,
and
resolve
to
run
away
with
a
stranger
,
whom
your
fair
face
,
and
insinuating
arts
,
had
bewitched
to
break
through
all
the
ties
of
honour
and
gratitude
to
me
,
even
at
a
time
when
the
happiness
of
his
future
life
depended
upon
my
favour
.
  
<EOS>
"
Henceforth
,
for
Pamela
's
sake
,
whenever
I
see
a
lovely
face
,
will
I
mistrust
a
deceitful
heart
;
and
whenever
I
hear
of
the
greatest
pretences
to
innocence
,
will
I
suspect
some
deep
-
laid
mischief
.
 
<EOS>
You
were
determined
to
place
no
confidence
in
me
,
though
I
have
solemnly
,
over
and
over
,
engaged
my
honour
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
What
,
though
I
had
alarmed
your
fears
in
sending
you
one
way
,
when
you
hoped
to
go
another
;
yet
,
had
I
not
,
to
convince
you
of
my
resolution
to
do
justly
by
you
,
(
although
with
great
reluctance
,
such
then
was
my
love
for
you
,
)
engaged
not
to
come
near
you
without
your
own
consent
?
 
<EOS>
Was
not
this
a
voluntary
demonstration
of
the
generosity
of
my
intention
to
you
?
 
<EOS>
Yet
how
have
you
requited
me
?
 
<EOS>
The
very
first
fellow
that
your
charming
face
,
and
insinuating
address
,
could
influence
,
you
have
practised
upon
,
corrupted
too
,
I
may
say
,
(
and
even
ruined
,
as
the
ungrateful
wretch
shall
find
,
)
and
thrown
your
forward
self
upon
him
.
 
<EOS>
As
,
therefore
,
you
would
place
no
confidence
in
me
,
my
honour
owes
you
nothing
;
and
,
in
a
little
time
,
you
shall
find
how
much
you
have
erred
,
in
treating
,
as
you
have
done
,
a
man
who
was
once
                                     
"
Your
affectionate
and
kind
friend
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Jewkes
has
directions
concerning
you
:
and
if
your
lot
is
now
harder
than
you
might
wish
,
you
will
bear
it
the
easier
,
because
your
own
rash
folly
has
brought
it
upon
you
.
"
  
Alas
!
<EOS>
for
me
,
what
a
fate
is
mine
,
to
be
thus
thought
artful
,
and
forward
,
and
ungrateful
;
when
all
I
intended
was
to
preserve
my
innocence
;
and
when
all
the
poor
little
shifts
,
which
his
superior
wicked
wit
and
cunning
have
rendered
ineffectual
,
were
forced
upon
me
in
my
own
necessary
defence
!
  
<EOS>
When
Mrs.
Jewkes
came
up
to
me
again
,
she
found
me
bathed
in
tears
.
 
<EOS>
She
seemed
,
as
I
thought
,
to
be
moved
to
some
compassion
;
and
finding
myself
now
entirely
in
her
power
,
and
that
it
is
not
for
me
to
provoke
her
,
I
said
,
It
is
now
,
I
see
,
in
vain
for
me
to
contend
against
my
evil
destiny
,
and
the
superior
arts
of
my
barbarous
master
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
resign
myself
to
the
Divine
will
,
and
prepare
to
expect
the
worst
.
 
<EOS>
But
you
see
how
this
poor
Mr.
Williams
is
drawn
in
and
undone
<EOS>
:
I
am
sorry
I
am
made
the
cause
of
his
ruin
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
,
poor
man
!
 
<EOS>
to
be
thus
involved
,
and
for
my
sake
too
!
 
<EOS>
But
if
you
'll
believe
me
,
said
I
,
I
gave
no
encouragement
to
what
he
proposed
,
as
to
marriage
;
nor
would
he
have
proposed
it
<EOS>
,
I
believe
,
but
as
the
only
honourable
way
he
thought
was
left
to
save
me
:
And
his
principal
motive
to
it
at
all
,
was
virtue
and
compassion
to
one
in
distress
.
 
<EOS>
What
other
view
could
he
have
?
 
<EOS>
You
know
I
am
poor
and
friendless
.
 
<EOS>
All
I
beg
of
you
is
,
to
let
the
poor
gentleman
have
notice
of
my
master
's
resentment
;
and
let
him
fly
the
country
,
and
not
be
thrown
into
gaol
.
 
<EOS>
This
will
answer
my
master
's
end
as
well
;
for
it
will
as
effectually
hinder
him
from
assisting
me
,
as
if
he
was
in
a
prison
.
  
<EOS>
Ask
me
,
said
she
,
to
do
any
thing
that
is
in
my
power
,
consistent
with
my
duty
and
trust
,
and
I
will
do
it
:
for
I
am
sorry
for
you
both
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
to
be
sure
,
I
shall
keep
no
correspondence
with
him
,
nor
let
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
offered
to
talk
of
a
duty
superior
to
that
she
mentioned
,
which
would
oblige
her
to
help
distressed
innocence
,
and
not
permit
her
to
go
the
lengths
enjoined
by
lawless
tyranny
;
but
she
plainly
bid
me
be
silent
on
that
head
:
for
it
was
in
vain
to
attempt
to
persuade
her
to
betray
her
trust
:
  
<EOS>
A
<EOS>
ll
I
have
to
advise
you
,
said
she
,
is
to
be
easy
;
lay
aside
all
your
contrivances
and
arts
to
get
away
,
and
make
me
your
friend
,
by
giving
me
no
reason
to
suspect
you
;
for
I
glory
in
my
fidelity
to
my
master
:
<EOS>
And
you
have
both
practised
some
strange
sly
arts
,
to
make
such
a
progress
as
he
has
owned
there
was
between
you
,
so
seldom
as
I
thought
you
saw
one
another
;
and
I
must
be
more
circumspect
than
I
have
been
.
  
<EOS>
This
doubled
my
concern
;
for
I
now
apprehended
I
should
be
much
closer
watched
than
before
.
  
<EOS>
Well
,
said
I
,
since
I
have
,
by
this
strange
accident
,
discovered
my
hard
destiny
;
let
me
read
over
again
that
fearful
letter
of
yours
,
that
I
may
get
it
by
heart
,
and
with
it
feed
my
distress
,
and
make
calamity
familiar
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
said
she
,
let
me
read
yours
again
.
 
<EOS>
I
gave
her
mine
,
and
she
lent
me
hers
:
<EOS>
and
so
I
took
a
copy
of
it
,
with
her
leave
;
because
,
as
I
said
I
would
,
by
it
,
prepare
myself
for
the
worst
.
 
<EOS>
And
when
I
had
done
,
I
pinned
it
on
the
head
of
the
couch
:
<EOS>
This
,
said
I
,
is
the
use
I
shall
make
of
this
wretched
copy
of
your
letter
;
and
here
you
shall
always
find
it
wet
with
my
tears
.
  
<EOS>
She
said
she
would
go
down
to
order
supper
;
and
insisted
upon
my
company
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
have
excused
myself
;
but
she
began
to
put
on
a
commanding
air
,
that
I
durst
not
oppose
.
 
<EOS>
And
when
I
went
down
,
she
took
me
by
the
hand
,
and
presented
me
to
the
most
hideous
monster
I
ever
saw
in
my
life
.
<EOS>
Here
,
Monsieur
Colbrand
,
said
she
,
here
is
your
pretty
ward
and
mine
;
let
us
try
to
make
her
time
with
us
easy
.
 
<EOS>
He
bowed
,
and
put
on
his
foreign
grimaces
,
and
seemed
to
bless
himself
;
and
,
in
broken
English
,
told
me
,
I
was
happy
in
de
affections
of
de
finest
gentleman
in
de
varld
!
 
<EOS>
I
was
quite
frightened
,
and
ready
to
drop
down
;
and
I
will
describe
him
to
you
,
my
dear
father
and
mother
,
if
now
you
will
ever
see
this
:
<EOS>
and
you
shall
judge
if
I
had
not
reason
,
especially
not
knowing
he
was
to
be
there
,
and
being
apprised
,
as
I
was
,
of
his
hated
employment
,
to
watch
me
closer
.
  
<EOS>
He
is
a
giant
of
a
man
for
stature
;
taller
by
a
good
deal
than
Harry
Mowlidge
,
in
your
neighbourhood
,
and
large
boned
,
and
scraggy
;
and
has
a
hand
!
 
<EOS>
I
never
saw
such
an
one
in
my
life
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
great
staring
eyes
,
like
the
bull
's
that
frightened
me
so
;
vast
jaw
-
bones
sticking
out
:
<EOS>
eyebrows
hanging
over
his
eyes
;
two
great
scars
upon
his
forehead
,
and
one
on
his
left
cheek
;
and
two
large
whiskers
,
and
a
monstrous
wide
mouth
;
blubber
lips
;
long
yellow
teeth
,
and
a
hideous
grin
.
 
<EOS>
He
wears
his
own
frightful
long
hair
,
tied
up
in
a
great
black
bag
;
a
black
crape
neckcloth
about
a
long
ugly
neck
:
and
his
throat
sticking
out
like
a
wen
.
<EOS>
As
to
the
rest
,
he
was
dressed
well
enough
,
and
had
a
sword
on
,
with
a
nasty
red
knot
to
it
;
leather
garters
,
buckled
below
his
knees
;
and
a
foot
 
near
as
long
as
my
arm
,
I
verily
think
.
  
<EOS>
He
said
,
he
fright
de
lady
;
and
offered
to
withdraw
;
but
she
bid
him
not
;
and
I
told
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
That
as
she
knew
I
had
been
crying
,
she
should
not
have
called
me
to
the
gentleman
without
letting
me
know
he
was
there
.
<EOS>
I
soon
went
up
to
my
closet
;
for
my
heart
ached
all
the
time
I
was
at
table
,
not
being
able
to
look
upon
him
without
horror
;
and
this
brute
of
a
woman
,
though
she
saw
my
distress
,
before
this
addition
to
it
,
no
doubt
did
it
on
purpose
to
strike
more
terror
into
me
.
 
<EOS>
And
indeed
it
had
its
effect
:
for
when
I
went
to
bed
,
I
could
think
of
nothing
but
his
hideous
person
,
and
my
master
's
more
hideous
actions
:
and
thought
them
too
well
paired
;
and
when
I
dropt
asleep
,
I
dreamed
they
were
both
coming
to
my
bedside
,
with
the
worst
designs
;
and
<EOS>
I
jumped
out
of
my
bed
in
my
sleep
,
and
frightened
Mrs.
Jewkes
;
till
,
waking
with
the
terror
,
I
told
her
my
dream
;
and
the
wicked
creature
only
laughed
,
and
said
,
All
I
feared
was
but
a
dream
,
as
well
as
that
;
and
when
it
was
over
,
and
I
was
well
awake
,
I
should
laugh
at
it
as
such
!
  
<EOS>
And
now
I
am
come
to
the
close
of
Wednesday
,
the
27th
day
of
my
distress
.
  
<EOS>
Poor
Mr.
Williams
is
actually
arrested
,
and
carried
away
to
Stamford
.
 
<EOS>
So
there
is
an
end
of
all
my
hopes
from
him
,
poor
gentleman
!
 
<EOS>
His
over
-
security
and
openness
have
ruined
us
both
!
 
<EOS>
I
was
but
too
well
convinced
,
that
we
ought
not
to
have
lost
a
moment
's
time
;
but
he
was
half
angry
,
and
thought
me
too
impatient
;
and
then
his
fatal
confessions
,
and
the
detestable
artifice
of
my
master
!
 
<EOS>
But
one
might
well
think
,
that
he
who
had
so
cunningly
,
and
so
wickedly
,
contrived
all
his
stratagems
hitherto
,
that
it
was
impossible
to
avoid
them
,
would
stick
at
nothing
to
complete
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
fear
I
shall
soon
find
it
so
!
  
<EOS>
But
one
stratagem
I
have
just
invented
,
though
a
very
discouraging
one
to
think
of
;
because
I
have
neither
friends
nor
money
,
nor
know
one
step
of
the
way
,
if
I
was
out
of
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
But
let
bulls
,
and
bears
,
and
lions
,
and
tigers
,
and
,
what
is
worse
,
false
,
treacherous
,
deceitful
men
,
stand
in
my
way
,
I
can
not
be
in
more
danger
than
I
am
;
and
I
depend
nothing
upon
his
three
weeks
:
for
how
do
I
know
,
now
he
is
in
such
a
passion
,
and
has
already
begun
his
vengeance
on
poor
Mr.
Williams
,
that
he
will
not
change
his
mind
,
and
come
down
to
Lincolnshire
before
he
goes
to
London
?
  
<EOS>
My
stratagem
is
this
:
I
will
endeavour
to
get
Mrs.
Jewkes
to
go
to
bed
without
me
,
as
she
often
does
,
while
I
sit
locked
up
in
my
closet
:
and
as
she
sleeps
very
sound
in
her
first
sleep
,
of
which
she
never
fails
to
give
notice
by
snoring
,
if
I
can
but
then
get
out
between
the
two
bars
of
the
window
,
(
for
you
know
I
am
very
slender
,
and
I
find
I
can
get
my
head
through
,
)
<EOS>
then
I
can
drop
upon
the
leads
underneath
,
which
are
little
more
than
my
height
,
and
which
leads
are
over
a
little
summer
-
parlour
,
that
juts
out
towards
the
garden
;
and
as
I
am
light
,
I
can
easily
drop
from
them
;
for
they
are
not
high
from
the
ground
:
then
I
shall
be
in
the
garden
;
and
then
,
as
I
have
the
key
of
the
back
-
door
,
I
will
get
out
.
<EOS>
But
I
have
another
piece
of
cunning
still
:
<EOS>
Good
Heaven
,
succeed
to
me
my
dangerous
,
but
innocent
devices
!
 
<EOS>
I
have
read
of
a
great
captain
,
who
,
being
in
danger
,
leaped
overboard
into
the
sea
,
and
his
enemies
,
as
he
swam
,
shooting
at
him
with
bows
and
arrows
,
he
unloosed
his
upper
garment
,
and
took
another
course
,
while
they
stuck
that
full
of
their
darts
and
arrows
;
and
so
he
escaped
,
and
lived
to
triumph
over
them
all
.
<EOS>
So
what
will
I
do
,
but
strip
off
my
upper
petticoat
,
and
throw
it
into
the
pond
,
with
my
neckhandkerchief
!
 
<EOS>
For
to
be
sure
,
when
they
miss
me
,
they
will
go
to
the
pond
first
,
thinking
I
have
drowned
myself
:
and
<EOS>
so
,
when
they
see
some
of
my
clothes
floating
there
,
they
will
be
all
employed
in
dragging
the
pond
,
which
is
a
very
large
one
;
and
as
I
shall
not
,
perhaps
,
be
missed
till
the
morning
,
this
will
give
me
opportunity
to
get
a
great
way
off
;
and
I
am
sure
I
will
run
for
it
when
I
am
out
.
<EOS>
And
so
I
trust
,
that
Providence
will
direct
my
steps
to
some
good
place
of
safety
,
and
make
some
worthy
body
my
friend
;
for
sure
,
if
I
suffer
ever
so
,
I
can
not
be
in
more
danger
,
nor
in
worse
hands
,
than
where
I
am
;
and
with
such
avowed
bad
designs
.
  
<EOS>
O
my
dear
parents
!
<EOS>
do
n't
be
frightened
when
you
come
to
read
this
!
 
<EOS>
But
all
will
be
over
before
you
can
see
it
;
and
so
God
direct
me
for
the
best
!
 
<EOS>
My
writings
,
for
fear
I
should
not
escape
,
I
will
bury
in
the
garden
;
for
,
to
be
sure
,
I
shall
be
searched
and
used
dreadfully
if
I
ca
n't
get
off
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
I
will
close
here
,
for
the
present
,
to
prepare
for
my
plot
.
 
<EOS>
Prosper
thou
,
O
gracious
Protector
of
oppressed
innocence
!
<EOS>
this
last
effort
of
thy
poor
handmaid
!
<EOS>
that
I
may
escape
the
crafty
devices
and
snares
that
have
begun
to
entangle
my
virtue
;
and
from
which
,
but
by
this
one
trial
,
I
see
no
way
of
escaping
.
 
<EOS>
And
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
whatever
becomes
of
me
,
bless
my
dear
parents
,
and
protect
poor
Mr.
Williams
from
ruin
!
<EOS>
for
he
was
happy
before
he
knew
me
.
  
<EOS>
Just
now
,
just
now
!
<EOS>
I
heard
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
who
is
in
her
cups
,
own
to
the
horrid
Colbrand
,
that
the
robbing
of
poor
Mr.
Williams
was
a
contrivance
of
hers
,
and
executed
by
the
groom
and
a
helper
,
in
order
to
seize
my
letters
upon
him
,
which
they
missed
.
 
<EOS>
They
are
now
both
laughing
at
the
dismal
story
,
which
they
little
think
I
overheard
 
<EOS>
O
how
my
heart
aches
!
<EOS>
for
what
are
not
such
wretches
capable
of
!
 
<EOS>
Can
you
blame
me
for
endeavouring
,
through
any
danger
,
to
get
out
of
such
clutches
?
  
<EOS>
Past
eleven
o'clock
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
is
come
up
,
and
gone
to
bed
;
and
bids
me
not
stay
long
in
my
closet
,
but
come
to
bed
.
 
<EOS>
O
for
a
dead
sleep
for
the
treacherous
brute
!
<EOS>
I
never
saw
her
so
tipsy
,
and
that
gives
me
hopes
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
tried
again
,
and
find
I
can
get
my
head
through
the
iron
bars
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
now
all
prepared
,
as
soon
as
I
hear
her
fast
;
and
now
I
'll
seal
up
these
,
and
my
other
papers
,
my
last
work
:
and
to
thy
providence
,
O
my
gracious
God
!
<EOS>
commit
the
rest
.
 
<EOS>
Once
more
,
God
bless
you
both
!
<EOS>
and
send
us
a
happy
meeting
;
if
not
here
,
in
his
heavenly
kingdom
.
 
<EOS>
Amen
.
  
<EOS>
Thursday
,
Friday
,
Saturday
,
Sunday
,
the
28th
,
29th
,
30th
,
and
31st
days
of
my
distress
.
  
<EOS>
And
distress
indeed
!
 
<EOS>
For
here
I
am
still
;
and
every
thing
has
been
worse
and
worse
!
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
the
poor
unhappy
Pamela
!
 
<EOS>
Without
any
hope
left
,
and
ruined
in
all
my
contrivances
.
 
<EOS>
But
<EOS>
,
oh
!
<EOS>
my
dear
parents
,
rejoice
with
me
,
even
in
this
low
plunge
of
my
distress
;
for
your
poor
Pamela
has
escaped
from
an
enemy
worse
than
any
she
ever
met
with
;
an
enemy
she
never
thought
of
before
,
and
was
hardly
able
to
stand
against
:
I
mean
,
the
weakness
and
presumption
,
both
in
one
,
of
her
own
mind
;
which
had
well
nigh
,
had
not
the
divine
grace
interposed
,
sunk
her
into
the
lowest
,
last
abyss
of
misery
and
perdition
!
  
<EOS>
I
will
proceed
,
as
I
have
opportunity
,
with
my
sad
relation
:
for
my
pen
and
ink
(
in
my
now
doubly
-
secured
closet
)
are
all
I
have
to
employ
myself
with
:
and
indeed
I
have
been
so
weak
,
that
,
till
yesterday
evening
,
I
have
not
been
able
to
hold
a
pen
.
  
<EOS>
I
took
with
me
but
one
shift
,
besides
what
I
had
on
,
and
two
handkerchiefs
,
and
two
caps
,
which
my
pocket
held
,
(
for
it
was
not
for
me
to
encumber
myself
,
)
and
all
my
stock
of
money
,
which
was
but
five
or
six
shillings
,
to
set
out
for
I
knew
not
where
;
and
got
out
of
the
window
,
not
without
some
difficulty
,
sticking
a
little
at
my
shoulders
and
hips
;
but
I
was
resolved
to
get
out
,
if
possible
.
 
<EOS>
And
it
was
farther
from
the
leads
than
I
thought
,
and
<EOS>
I
was
afraid
I
had
sprained
my
ancle
;
and
when
I
had
dropt
from
the
leads
to
the
ground
,
it
was
still
farther
off
;
but
I
did
pretty
well
there
,
at
least
.
 
<EOS>
I
got
no
hurt
to
hinder
me
from
pursuing
my
intentions
.
 
<EOS>
So
being
now
on
the
ground
,
I
hid
my
papers
under
a
rose
-
bush
,
and
covered
them
with
mould
,
and
there
they
still
lie
,
as
I
hope
.
 
<EOS>
Then
I
hied
away
to
the
pond
:
The
clock
struck
twelve
,
just
as
I
got
out
;
and
it
was
a
dark
misty
night
,
and
very
cold
;
but
I
felt
it
not
then
.
  
<EOS>
When
I
came
to
the
pond
-
side
,
I
flung
in
my
upper
-
coat
,
as
I
had
designed
,
and
my
neckhandkerchief
,
and
a
round
-
eared
cap
,
with
a
knot
;
and
then
with
great
speed
ran
to
the
door
,
and
took
the
key
out
of
my
pocket
,
my
poor
heart
beating
all
the
time
against
my
bosom
,
as
if
it
would
have
forced
its
way
through
it
:
and
beat
it
well
might
!
<EOS>
for
I
then
,
too
late
,
found
,
that
I
was
most
miserably
disappointed
;
for
the
wicked
woman
had
taken
off
that
lock
,
and
put
another
on
;
so
that
my
key
would
not
open
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
tried
,
and
tried
,
and
feeling
about
,
I
found
a
padlock
besides
,
on
another
part
of
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
O
then
how
my
heart
sunk
!
 
<EOS>
I
dropt
down
with
grief
and
confusion
,
unable
to
stir
or
support
myself
,
for
a
while
.
 
<EOS>
But
my
fears
awakening
my
resolution
,
and
knowing
that
my
attempt
would
be
as
terrible
for
me
as
any
other
danger
I
could
then
encounter
<EOS>
,
I
clambered
up
upon
the
ledges
of
the
door
,
and
upon
the
lock
,
which
was
a
great
wooden
one
;
and
reached
the
top
of
the
door
with
my
hands
;
then
,
little
thinking
I
could
climb
so
well
,
I
made
shift
to
lay
hold
on
the
top
of
the
wall
with
my
hands
;
but
,
alas
for
me
!
<EOS>
nothing
but
ill
luck
!
  
<EOS>
no
escape
for
poor
Pamela
!
 
<EOS>
The
wall
being
old
,
the
bricks
I
held
by
gave
way
,
just
as
I
was
taking
a
spring
to
get
up
;
and
down
came
I
,
and
received
such
a
blow
upon
my
head
,
with
one
of
the
bricks
,
that
it
quite
stunned
me
;
and
I
broke
my
shins
and
my
ancle
besides
,
and
beat
off
the
heel
of
one
of
my
shoes
.
  
<EOS>
In
this
dreadful
way
,
flat
upon
the
ground
,
lay
poor
I
,
for
I
believe
five
or
six
minutes
;
and
then
trying
to
get
up
,
I
sunk
down
again
two
or
three
times
;
and
my
left
hip
and
shoulder
were
very
stiff
,
and
full
of
pain
,
with
bruises
;
and
,
besides
,
my
head
bled
,
and
ached
grievously
with
the
blow
I
had
with
the
brick
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
these
hurts
I
valued
not
;
but
crept
a
good
way
upon
my
feet
and
hands
,
in
search
of
a
ladder
<EOS>
,
I
just
recollected
to
have
seen
against
the
wall
two
days
before
,
on
which
the
gardener
was
nailing
a
nectarine
branch
that
was
loosened
from
the
wall
:
<EOS>
but
no
ladder
could
I
find
,
and
the
wall
was
very
high
.
 
<EOS>
What
now
,
thought
I
,
must
become
of
the
miserable
Pamela
!
 
<EOS>
Then
I
began
to
wish
myself
most
heartily
again
in
my
closet
,
and
to
repent
of
my
attempt
,
which
I
now
censured
as
rash
,
because
it
did
not
succeed
.
  
<EOS>
God
forgive
me
!
<EOS>
but
a
sad
thought
came
just
then
into
my
head
!
 
<EOS>
I
tremble
to
think
of
it
!
 
<EOS>
Indeed
my
apprehensions
of
the
usage
I
should
meet
with
,
had
like
to
have
made
me
miserable
for
ever
!
 
<EOS>
O
<EOS>
my
dear
,
dear
parents
,
forgive
your
poor
child
;
but
being
then
quite
desperate
<EOS>
,
I
crept
along
,
till
I
could
raise
myself
on
my
staggering
feet
;
and
away
limped
I
!
 
<EOS>
What
to
do
,
but
to
throw
myself
into
the
pond
,
and
so
put
a
period
to
all
my
griefs
in
this
world
!
 
<EOS>
But
,
O
!
<EOS>
to
find
them
infinitely
aggravated
(
had
I
not
,
by
the
divine
grace
,
been
withheld
)
in
a
miserable
eternity
!
 
<EOS>
As
I
have
escaped
this
temptation
,
(
blessed
be
God
for
it
!
)
<EOS>
I
will
tell
you
my
conflicts
on
this
dreadful
occasion
,
that
the
divine
mercies
may
be
magnified
in
my
deliverance
,
that
I
am
yet
on
this
side
the
dreadful
gulf
,
from
which
there
could
have
been
no
return
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
well
for
me
,
as
I
have
since
thought
,
that
I
was
so
maimed
,
as
made
me
the
longer
before
I
got
to
the
water
;
for
this
gave
me
time
to
consider
,
and
abated
the
impetuousness
of
my
passions
,
which
possibly
might
otherwise
have
hurried
me
,
in
my
first
transport
of
grief
,
(
on
my
seeing
no
way
to
escape
,
and
the
hard
usage
I
had
reason
to
expect
from
my
dreadful
keepers
,
)
to
throw
myself
in
.
 
<EOS>
But
my
weakness
of
body
made
me
move
so
slowly
,
that
it
gave
time
,
as
I
said
,
for
a
little
reflection
,
a
ray
of
grace
,
to
dart
in
upon
my
benighted
mind
;
and
so
,
when
I
came
to
the
pond
-
side
,
I
sat
myself
down
on
the
sloping
bank
,
and
began
to
ponder
my
wretched
condition
;
and
thus
I
reasoned
with
myself
.
  
<EOS>
Pause
here
a
little
,
Pamela
,
on
what
thou
art
about
,
before
thou
takest
the
dreadful
leap
;
and
consider
whether
there
be
no
way
yet
left
,
<EOS>
no
hope
,
if
not
to
escape
from
this
wicked
house
,
yet
from
the
mischiefs
threatened
thee
in
it
.
  
<EOS>
I
then
considered
;
and
,
after
I
had
cast
about
in
my
mind
every
thing
that
could
make
me
hope
,
and
saw
no
probability
;
a
wicked
woman
,
devoid
of
all
compassion
!
<EOS>
a
horrid
helper
,
just
arrived
,
in
this
dreadful
Colbrand
!
<EOS>
an
angry
and
resenting
master
,
who
now
hated
me
,
and
threatened
the
most
afflicting
evils
!
<EOS>
and
that
I
should
,
in
all
probability
,
be
deprived
even
of
the
opportunity
,
I
now
had
before
me
,
to
free
myself
from
all
their
persecutions
!
 
<EOS>
What
hast
thou
to
do
,
distressed
creature
,
said
I
to
myself
,
but
throw
thyself
upon
a
merciful
God
,
(
who
knows
how
innocently
I
suffer
,
)
to
avoid
the
merciless
wickedness
of
those
who
are
determined
on
my
ruin
?
  
<EOS>
And
then
,
thought
I
,
(
<EOS>
and
oh
!
<EOS>
that
thought
was
surely
of
the
devil
's
instigation
;
for
it
was
very
soothing
,
and
powerful
with
me
,
)
<EOS>
these
wicked
wretches
,
who
now
have
no
remorse
,
no
pity
on
me
,
will
then
be
moved
to
lament
their
misdoings
;
and
when
they
see
the
dead
corpse
of
the
unhappy
Pamela
dragged
out
to
these
dewy
banks
,
and
lying
breathless
at
their
feet
,
they
will
find
that
remorse
to
soften
their
obdurate
heart
,
which
,
now
,
has
no
place
there
!
 
<EOS>
And
my
master
,
my
angry
master
,
will
then
forget
his
resentments
,
and
say
,
O
,
this
is
the
unhappy
Pamela
!
<EOS>
that
I
have
so
causelessly
persecuted
and
destroyed
!
 
<EOS>
Now
do
I
see
she
preferred
her
honesty
to
her
life
,
will
he
say
,
and
is
no
hypocrite
,
nor
deceiver
;
but
really
was
the
innocent
creature
she
pretended
to
be
!
<EOS>
Then
,
thought
I
,
will
he
,
perhaps
,
shed
a
few
tears
over
the
poor
corpse
of
his
persecuted
servant
;
and
though
he
may
give
out
,
it
was
love
and
disappointment
;
and
that
,
perhaps
,
(
in
order
to
hide
his
own
guilt
,
)
for
the
unfortunate
Mr.
Williams
,
yet
will
he
be
inwardly
grieved
,
and
order
me
a
decent
funeral
,
and
save
me
,
or
rather
this
part
of
me
,
from
the
dreadful
stake
,
and
the
highway
interment
;
and
the
young
men
and
maidens
all
around
my
dear
father
's
will
pity
poor
Pamela
!
 
<EOS>
But
,
O
!
<EOS>
I
hope
I
shall
not
be
the
subject
of
their
ballads
and
elegies
;
but
that
my
memory
,
for
the
sake
of
my
dear
father
and
mother
,
may
quickly
slide
into
oblivion
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
once
rising
,
<EOS>
so
indulgent
was
I
to
this
sad
way
of
thinking
,
to
throw
myself
in
:
<EOS>
But
,
again
,
my
bruises
made
me
slow
;
and
I
thought
,
What
art
thou
about
to
do
,
wretched
Pamela
?
 
<EOS>
How
knowest
thou
,
though
the
prospect
be
all
dark
to
thy
short
-
sighted
eye
,
what
God
may
do
for
thee
,
even
when
all
human
means
fail
?
 
<EOS>
God
Almighty
would
not
lay
me
under
these
sore
afflictions
,
if
he
had
not
given
me
strength
to
grapple
with
them
,
if
I
will
exert
it
as
I
ought
:
And
who
knows
,
but
that
the
very
presence
<EOS>
I
so
much
dread
of
my
angry
and
designing
master
,
(
for
he
has
had
me
in
his
power
before
,
and
yet
I
have
escaped
;
)
may
be
better
for
me
,
than
these
persecuting
emissaries
of
his
,
who
,
for
his
money
,
are
true
to
their
wicked
trust
,
and
are
hardened
by
that
,
and
a
long
habit
of
wickedness
,
against
compunction
of
heart
?
 
<EOS>
God
can
touch
his
heart
in
an
instant
;
and
if
this
should
not
be
done
,
I
can
then
but
put
an
end
to
my
life
by
some
other
means
,
if
I
am
so
resolved
.
  
<EOS>
But
how
do
I
know
,
thought
<EOS>
I
,
that
even
these
bruises
and
maims
that
I
have
gotten
,
while
I
pursued
only
the
laudable
escape
I
had
meditated
,
may
not
kindly
have
furnished
me
with
the
opportunity
I
am
now
tempted
with
to
precipitate
myself
,
and
of
surrendering
up
my
life
,
spotless
and
unguilty
,
to
that
merciful
Being
who
gave
it
!
  
<EOS>
Then
,
thought
I
,
who
gave
thee
,
presumptuous
as
thou
art
,
a
power
over
thy
life
?
 
<EOS>
Who
authorised
thee
to
put
an
end
to
it
,
when
the
weakness
of
thy
mind
suggests
not
to
thee
a
way
to
preserve
it
with
honour
?
 
<EOS>
How
knowest
thou
<EOS>
what
purposes
God
may
have
to
serve
,
by
the
trials
with
which
thou
art
now
exercised
?
 
<EOS>
Art
thou
to
put
a
bound
to
the
divine
will
,
and
to
say
<EOS>
,
Thus
much
will
I
bear
,
and
no
more
?
 
<EOS>
And
wilt
thou
dare
to
say
,
That
if
the
trial
be
augmented
and
continued
,
thou
wilt
sooner
die
than
bear
it
?
  
<EOS>
This
act
of
despondency
,
thought
I
,
is
a
sin
,
that
,
if
I
pursue
it
,
admits
of
no
repentance
,
and
can
therefore
hope
no
forgiveness
.
 
<EOS>
And
wilt
thou
,
to
shorten
thy
transitory
griefs
,
heavy
as
they
are
,
and
weak
as
thou
fanciest
thyself
,
plunge
both
body
and
soul
into
everlasting
misery
!
<EOS>
Hitherto
,
Pamela
,
thought
I
,
thou
art
<EOS>
the
innocent
,
the
suffering
Pamela
;
and
wilt
thou
,
to
avoid
thy
sufferings
,
be
the
guilty
aggressor
?
 
<EOS>
And
,
because
wicked
men
persecute
thee
,
wilt
thou
fly
in
the
face
of
the
Almighty
,
and
distrust
his
grace
and
goodness
,
who
can
still
turn
all
these
sufferings
to
benefits
?
 
<EOS>
And
how
do
I
know
,
but
that
God
,
who
sees
all
the
lurking
vileness
of
my
heart
,
may
have
permitted
these
sufferings
on
that
very
score
,
and
to
make
me
rely
solely
on
his
grace
and
assistance
,
who
,
perhaps
,
have
too
much
prided
myself
in
a
vain
dependence
on
my
own
foolish
contrivances
?
  
<EOS>
Then
,
again
,
thought
I
,
wilt
thou
suffer
in
one
moment
all
the
good
lessons
of
thy
poor
honest
parents
,
and
the
benefit
of
their
example
,
(
who
have
persisted
in
doing
their
duty
with
resignation
to
the
divine
will
,
amidst
the
extreme
degrees
of
disappointment
,
poverty
,
and
distress
,
and
the
persecutions
of
an
ungrateful
world
,
and
merciless
creditors
,
)
to
be
thrown
away
upon
thee
:
and
bring
down
,
as
in
all
probability
this
thy
rashness
will
,
their
grey
hairs
with
sorrow
to
the
grave
,
when
they
shall
understand
,
that
their
beloved
daughter
,
slighting
the
tenders
of
divine
grace
,
despairing
of
the
mercies
of
a
protecting
God
,
has
blemished
,
in
this
last
act
,
a
whole
life
,
which
they
had
hitherto
approved
and
delighted
in
?
  
<EOS>
What
then
,
presumptuous
Pamela
,
dost
thou
here
?
<EOS>
thought
I
<EOS>
:
Quit
with
speed
these
perilous
banks
,
and
fly
from
these
curling
waters
,
that
seem
,
in
their
meaning
murmurs
,
this
still
night
,
to
reproach
thy
rashness
!
<EOS>
Tempt
not
God
's
goodness
on
the
mossy
banks
,
that
have
been
witnesses
of
thy
guilty
purpose
:
and
while
thou
hast
power
left
thee
,
avoid
the
tempting
evil
,
lest
thy
grand
enemy
,
now
repulsed
by
divine
grace
,
and
due
reflection
,
return
to
the
assault
with
a
force
that
thy
weakness
may
not
be
able
to
resist
!
<EOS>
and
let
one
rash
moment
destroy
all
the
convictions
,
which
now
have
awed
thy
rebellious
mind
into
duty
and
resignation
to
the
divine
will
!
  
<EOS>
And
so
saying
,
I
arose
;
but
was
so
stiff
with
my
hurts
,
so
cold
with
the
moist
dew
of
the
night
,
and
the
wet
grass
on
which
I
had
sat
,
as
also
with
the
damps
arising
from
so
large
a
piece
of
water
,
<EOS>
that
with
great
pain
I
got
from
this
pond
,
which
now
I
think
of
with
terror
;
and
bending
my
limping
steps
towards
the
house
,
took
refuge
in
the
corner
of
an
outhouse
,
where
wood
and
coals
are
laid
up
for
family
use
,
till
I
should
be
found
by
my
cruel
keepers
,
and
consigned
to
a
more
wretched
confinement
,
and
worse
usage
than
I
had
hitherto
experienced
;
and
there
behind
a
pile
of
firewood
I
crept
,
and
lay
down
,
as
you
may
imagine
,
with
a
mind
just
broken
,
and
a
heart
sensible
to
nothing
but
the
extremest
woe
and
dejection
.
  
<EOS>
This
,
my
dear
father
and
mother
,
is
the
issue
of
your
poor
Pamela
's
fruitless
enterprise
;
and
who
knows
,
if
I
had
got
out
at
the
back
-
door
,
whether
I
had
been
at
all
in
a
better
case
,
moneyless
,
friendless
,
as
I
am
,
and
in
a
strange
place
!
 
<EOS>
But
blame
not
your
poor
daughter
too
much
:
<EOS>
Nay
,
if
ever
you
see
this
miserable
scribble
,
all
bathed
and
blotted
with
my
tears
,
let
your
pity
get
the
better
of
your
reprehension
!
 
<EOS>
But
I
know
it
will
 
<EOS>
And
I
must
leave
off
for
the
present
.
 
<EOS>
For
,
oh
!
<EOS>
my
strength
and
my
will
are
at
this
time
very
far
unequal
to
one
another
.
 
<EOS>
But
yet
I
will
add
,
that
though
I
should
have
praised
God
for
my
deliverance
,
had
I
been
freed
from
my
wicked
keepers
,
and
my
designing
master
;
yet
I
have
more
abundant
reason
to
praise
him
,
that
I
have
been
delivered
from
a
worse
enemy
,
 
myself
!
  
<EOS>
I
will
conclude
my
sad
relation
.

It
seems
Mrs.
Jewkes
awaked
not
till
day
-
break
;
and
not
finding
me
in
bed
,
she
called
me
;
and
,
no
answer
being
returned
,
she
relates
,
that
she
got
out
of
bed
,
and
ran
to
my
closet
;
and
,
missing
me
,
searched
under
the
bed
,
and
in
another
closet
,
finding
the
chamber
-
door
as
she
had
left
it
,
quite
fast
,
and
the
key
,
as
usual
,
about
her
wrist
.
 
<EOS>
For
if
I
could
have
got
out
of
the
chamber
-
door
,
there
were
two
or
three
passages
,
and
doors
to
them
all
,
double
-
locked
and
barred
,
to
go
through
into
the
great
garden
;
so
that
,
to
escape
,
there
was
no
way
,
but
out
of
the
window
;
and
of
that
window
,
because
of
the
summer
-
parlour
under
it
:
<EOS>
for
the
other
windows
are
a
great
way
from
the
ground
.
  
<EOS>
She
says
she
was
excessively
frightened
;
and
instantly
raised
the
Swiss
,
and
the
two
maids
,
who
lay
not
far
off
;
and
finding
every
door
fast
,
she
said
,
I
must
be
carried
away
,
as
St.
Peter
was
out
of
prison
,
by
some
angel
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
a
wonder
she
had
not
a
worse
thought
!
  
<EOS>
She
says
,
she
wept
,
and
wrung
her
hands
,
and
took
on
sadly
,
running
about
like
a
mad
woman
,
little
thinking
I
could
have
got
out
of
the
closet
window
,
between
the
iron
bars
;
and
,
indeed
,
I
do
n't
know
whether
I
could
do
so
again
.
 
<EOS>
But
at
last
finding
that
casement
open
,
they
concluded
it
must
be
so
;
and
ran
out
into
the
garden
,
and
found
my
footsteps
in
the
mould
of
the
bed
which
I
dropt
down
upon
from
the
leads
:
And
so
speeded
away
all
of
them
;
that
is
to
say
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
Colbrand
,
and
Nan
,
towards
the
back
-
door
,
to
see
if
that
was
fast
;
while
the
cook
was
sent
to
the
out
-
offices
to
raise
the
men
,
and
make
them
get
horses
ready
,
to
take
each
a
several
way
to
pursue
me
.
  
<EOS>
But
,
it
seems
,
finding
that
door
double
-
locked
and
padlocked
,
and
the
heel
of
my
shoe
,
and
the
broken
bricks
,
they
verily
concluded
I
was
got
away
by
some
means
over
the
wall
;
and
then
,
they
say
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
seemed
like
a
distracted
woman
:
<EOS>
Till
,
at
last
,
Nan
had
the
thought
to
go
towards
the
pond
:
and
there
seeing
my
coat
,
and
cap
,
and
handkerchief
,
in
the
water
,
cast
almost
to
the
banks
by
the
agitation
of
the
waves
,
she
thought
it
was
me
;
and
,
screaming
out
,
ran
to
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
and
said
,
O
,
madam
,
madam
!
<EOS>
here
's
a
piteous
thing
!
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Pamela
lies
drowned
in
the
pond
.
 
<EOS>
Thither
they
all
ran
;
and
finding
my
clothes
,
doubted
not
I
was
at
the
bottom
;
and
they
all
,
Swiss
among
the
rest
,
beat
their
breasts
,
and
made
most
dismal
lamentations
;
and
Mrs.
Jewkes
sent
Nan
to
the
men
,
to
bid
them
get
the
drag
-
net
ready
,
and
leave
the
horses
,
and
come
to
try
to
find
the
poor
innocent
!
<EOS>
as
she
,
it
seems
,
then
called
me
,
beating
her
breast
,
and
lamenting
my
hard
hap
;
but
most
what
would
become
of
them
,
and
what
account
they
should
give
to
my
master
.
  
<EOS>
While
every
one
was
thus
differently
employed
,
some
weeping
and
wailing
,
some
running
here
<EOS>
and
there
,
Nan
came
into
the
wood
-
house
;
and
there
lay
poor
I
;
so
weak
,
so
low
,
and
dejected
,
and
withal
<EOS>
so
stiff
with
my
bruises
,
that
I
could
not
stir
,
nor
help
myself
to
get
upon
my
feet
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
said
,
with
a
low
voice
,
(
for
I
could
hardly
speak
,
)
<EOS>
Mrs.
Ann
!
<EOS>
Mrs.
Ann
!
 
<EOS>
The
creature
was
sadly
frightened
,
but
was
taking
up
a
billet
to
knock
me
on
the
head
,
believing
I
was
some
thief
,
as
she
said
;
but
I
cried
out
,
O
<EOS>
Mrs.
Ann
,
Mrs.
Ann
,
help
me
,
for
pity
's
sake
,
to
Mrs.
Jewkes
!
<EOS>
for
I
can
not
get
up
!
 
<EOS>
Bless
me
,
said
she
,
<EOS>
what
!
<EOS>
you
,
madam
!
 
<EOS>
Why
,
our
hearts
are
almost
broken
,
and
we
were
going
to
drag
the
pond
for
you
,
believing
you
had
drowned
yourself
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
said
she
,
you
'll
make
us
all
alive
again
!
  
<EOS>
And
,
without
helping
me
,
she
ran
away
to
the
pond
,
and
brought
all
the
crew
to
the
wood
-
house
.
 
<EOS>
The
wicked
woman
,
as
she
entered
,
said
,
Where
is
she
?
 
<EOS>
Plague
of
her
spells
,
and
her
witchcrafts
!
 
<EOS>
She
shall
dearly
repent
of
this
trick
,
if
my
name
be
Jewkes
;
and
,
coming
to
me
,
took
hold
of
my
arm
so
roughly
,
and
gave
me
such
a
pull
,
as
made
me
squeal
out
,
(
my
shoulder
being
bruised
on
that
side
,
)
and
drew
me
on
my
face
.
 
<EOS>
O
cruel
creature
!
<EOS>
said
I
,
if
you
knew
what
I
have
suffered
,
it
would
move
you
to
pity
me
!
  
<EOS>
Even
Colbrand
seemed
to
be
concerned
,
and
said
,
Fie
,
madam
,
fie
!
<EOS>
you
see
she
is
almost
dead
!
 
<EOS>
You
must
not
be
so
rough
with
her
.
 
<EOS>
The
coachman
Robin
seemed
to
be
sorry
for
me
too
,
and
said
,
with
sobs
,
What
a
scene
is
here
!
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
see
she
is
all
bloody
in
her
head
,
and
can
not
stir
?
  
<EOS>
Curse
of
her
contrivance
!
<EOS>
said
the
horrid
creature
;
she
has
frightened
me
out
of
my
wits
,
I
'm
sure
.
 
<EOS>
How
the
d####l
came
you
here
?
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
said
I
,
ask
me
now
no
questions
,
but
let
the
maids
carry
me
up
to
my
prison
;
and
there
let
me
die
decently
,
and
in
peace
!
 
<EOS>
For
,
indeed
,
I
thought
I
could
not
live
two
hours
.
  
<EOS>
The
still
more
inhuman
tigress
said
,
I
suppose
you
want
Mr.
Williams
to
pray
by
you
,
do
n't
you
?
 
<EOS>
Well
,
I
'll
send
for
my
master
this
minute
:
let
him
come
and
watch
you
himself
,
for
me
;
for
there
's
no
such
thing
as
holding
you
<EOS>
,
I
'm
sure
.
  
<EOS>
So
the
maids
took
me
up
between
them
,
and
carried
me
to
my
chamber
;
and
when
the
wretch
saw
how
bad
I
was
,
she
began
a
little
to
relent
 
while
every
one
wondered
(
at
which
I
had
neither
strength
nor
inclination
to
tell
them
)
how
all
this
came
to
pass
,
which
they
imputed
to
sorcery
and
witchcraft
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
so
weak
,
when
I
had
got
up
stairs
,
that
I
fainted
away
,
with
dejection
,
pain
,
and
fatigue
;
and
they
undressed
me
,
and
got
me
to
bed
;
and
Mrs.
Jewkes
ordered
Nan
to
bathe
my
shoulder
,
and
arm
,
and
ancle
,
with
some
old
rum
warmed
;
and
they
cut
the
hair
a
little
from
the
back
part
of
my
head
,
and
washed
that
;
for
it
was
clotted
with
blood
,
from
a
pretty
long
,
but
not
a
deep
gash
;
and
put
a
family
plaister
upon
it
;
for
,
if
this
woman
has
any
good
quality
,
it
is
,
it
seems
,
in
a
readiness
and
skill
to
manage
in
cases
,
where
sudden
misfortunes
happen
in
a
family
.
  
<EOS>
After
this
,
I
fell
into
a
pretty
sound
and
refreshing
sleep
,
and
lay
till
twelve
o'clock
,
tolerably
easy
,
considering
I
was
very
feverish
,
and
aguishly
inclined
;
and
she
took
a
deal
of
care
to
fit
me
to
undergo
more
trials
,
which
I
had
hoped
would
have
been
happily
ended
:
but
Providence
did
not
see
fit
.
  
<EOS>
She
would
make
me
rise
about
twelve
:
but
I
was
so
weak
<EOS>
,
I
could
only
sit
up
till
the
bed
was
made
,
and
went
into
it
again
;
and
was
,
as
they
said
,
delirious
some
part
of
the
afternoon
.
 
<EOS>
But
having
a
tolerable
night
on
Thursday
,
I
was
a
good
deal
better
on
Friday
,
and
on
Saturday
got
up
,
and
ate
a
little
spoon
-
meat
,
and
my
feverishness
seemed
to
be
gone
;
and
I
was
so
mended
by
evening
,
that
I
begged
her
indulgence
in
my
closet
,
to
be
left
to
myself
;
which
she
consented
to
<EOS>
,
it
being
double
-
barred
the
day
before
,
and
I
assuring
her
,
that
all
my
contrivances
,
as
she
called
them
,
were
at
an
end
.
 
<EOS>
But
first
she
made
me
tell
the
whole
story
of
my
enterprise
;
which
I
did
very
faithfully
,
knowing
now
that
nothing
could
stand
me
in
any
stead
,
or
contribute
to
my
safety
and
escape
:
<EOS>
And
she
seemed
full
of
wonder
at
my
resolution
;
but
told
me
frankly
,
that
I
should
have
found
it
a
hard
matter
to
get
quite
off
;
for
that
she
was
provided
with
a
warrant
from
my
master
(
who
is
a
justice
of
peace
in
this
county
as
well
as
in
the
other
)
to
get
me
apprehended
,
if
I
had
got
away
,
on
suspicion
of
wronging
him
,
let
me
have
been
where
I
would
.
  
<EOS>
O
how
deep
-
laid
are
the
mischiefs
designed
to
fall
on
my
devoted
head
!
  
<EOS>
Surely
,
surely
,
I
can
not
be
worthy
of
all
this
contrivance
!
 
<EOS>
This
too
well
shews
me
the
truth
of
what
was
hinted
to
me
formerly
at
the
other
house
,
that
my
master
swore
he
would
have
me
!
 
<EOS>
O
preserve
me
,
Heaven
!
<EOS>
from
being
his
,
in
his
own
wicked
sense
of
the
adjuration
!
  
<EOS>
I
must
add
,
that
now
the
woman
sees
me
pick
up
so
fast
,
she
uses
me
worse
,
and
has
abridged
me
of
paper
,
all
but
one
sheet
,
which
I
am
to
shew
her
,
written
or
unwritten
,
on
demand
:
and
has
reduced
me
to
one
pen
:
yet
my
hidden
stores
stand
me
in
stead
.
 
<EOS>
But
she
is
more
and
more
snappish
and
cross
;
and
tauntingly
calls
me
Mrs.
Williams
,
and
any
thing
she
thinks
will
vex
me
.
  
<EOS>
Sunday
afternoon
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
has
thought
fit
to
give
me
an
airing
,
for
three
or
four
hours
,
this
afternoon
;
and
I
am
a
good
deal
better
and
should
be
much
more
so
,
if
I
knew
for
what
I
am
reserved
.
 
<EOS>
But
health
is
a
blessing
hardly
to
be
coveted
in
my
circumstances
,
since
that
<EOS>
but
exposes
me
to
the
calamity
I
am
in
continual
apprehensions
of
;
whereas
a
weak
and
sickly
state
might
possibly
move
compassion
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
O
how
I
dread
the
coming
of
this
angry
and
incensed
master
;
though
I
am
sure
I
have
done
him
no
harm
!
  
<EOS>
Just
now
we
heard
,
that
he
had
like
to
have
been
drowned
in
crossing
the
stream
,
a
few
days
ago
,
in
pursuing
his
game
.
 
<EOS>
What
is
the
matter
,
that
with
all
his
ill
usage
of
me
,
I
can
not
hate
him
?
 
<EOS>
To
be
sure
,
I
am
not
like
other
people
!
 
<EOS>
He
has
certainly
done
enough
to
make
me
hate
him
;
but
<EOS>
yet
,
when
I
heard
his
danger
,
which
was
very
great
,
I
could
not
in
my
heart
forbear
rejoicing
for
his
safety
;
though
his
death
would
have
ended
my
afflictions
.
 
<EOS>
Ungenerous
master
!
<EOS>
if
you
knew
this
,
you
surely
would
not
be
so
much
my
persecutor
!
 
<EOS>
But
,
for
my
late
good
lady
's
sake
,
I
must
wish
him
well
;
and
O
what
an
angel
would
he
be
in
my
eyes
yet
,
if
he
would
cease
his
attempts
,
and
reform
!
  
<EOS>
Well
,
I
hear
by
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
that
John
Arnold
is
turned
away
,
being
detected
in
writing
to
Mr.
Williams
;
and
that
Mr.
Longman
,
and
Mr.
Jonathan
the
butler
,
have
incurred
his
displeasure
,
for
offering
to
speak
in
my
behalf
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jervis
too
is
in
danger
;
for
all
these
three
,
probably
,
went
together
to
beg
in
my
favour
;
for
now
it
is
known
where
I
am
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
has
,
with
the
news
about
my
master
,
received
a
letter
:
but
she
says
the
contents
are
too
bad
for
me
to
know
.
 
<EOS>
They
must
be
bad
indeed
,
if
they
be
worse
than
what
I
have
already
known
.
  
<EOS>
Just
now
the
horrid
creature
tells
me
,
as
a
secret
,
that
she
has
reason
to
think
he
has
found
out
a
way
to
satisfy
my
scruples
:
<EOS>
It
is
,
by
marrying
me
to
this
dreadful
Colbrand
,
and
buying
me
of
him
on
the
wedding
day
,
for
a
sum
of
money
!
 
<EOS>
Was
ever
the
like
heard
?
 
<EOS>
She
says
it
will
be
my
duty
to
obey
my
husband
;
and
that
Mr.
Williams
will
be
forced
,
as
a
punishment
,
to
marry
us
;
and
that
,
when
my
master
has
paid
for
me
,
and
I
am
surrendered
up
,
the
Swiss
is
to
go
home
again
,
with
the
money
,
to
his
former
wife
and
children
;
for
,
she
says
,
it
is
the
custom
of
those
people
to
have
a
wife
in
every
nation
.
  
<EOS>
But
this
,
to
be
sure
,
is
horrid
romancing
!
 
<EOS>
Yet
,
abominable
as
it
is
,
it
may
possibly
serve
to
introduce
some
plot
now
hatching
!
 
<EOS>
With
what
strange
perplexities
is
my
poor
mind
agitated
!
 
<EOS>
Perchance
,
some
sham
-
marriage
may
be
designed
,
on
purpose
to
ruin
me
;
But
can
a
husband
sell
his
wife
against
her
own
consent
?
 
<EOS>
And
will
such
a
bargain
stand
good
in
law
?

Monday

my
imprisonment
.
  
<EOS>
Nothing
offers
these
days
but
squabblings
between
Mrs.
Jewkes
and
me
.
<EOS>
She
grows
worse
and
worse
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
vexed
her
yesterday
,
because
she
talked
nastily
;
and
told
her
she
talked
more
like
a
vile
London
prostitute
,
than
a
gentleman
's
housekeeper
;
and
she
thinks
she
can
not
use
me
bad
enough
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
Bless
me
!
<EOS>
she
curses
and
storms
at
me
like
a
trooper
,
and
can
hardly
keep
her
hands
off
me
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
believe
she
must
talk
sadly
,
to
make
me
say
such
harsh
words
:
indeed
it
can
not
be
repeated
;
as
she
is
a
disgrace
to
her
sex
.
 
<EOS>
And
then
she
ridicules
me
,
and
laughs
at
my
notions
of
honesty
;
and
tells
me
,
impudent
creature
as
she
is
!
<EOS>
what
a
fine
bed
-
fellow
<EOS>
I
shall
make
for
my
master
(
and
such-
like
)
,
with
such
whimsical
notions
about
me
!
 
<EOS>
Do
you
think
this
is
to
be
borne
?
 
<EOS>
And
yet
she
talks
worse
than
this
,
if
possible
!
<EOS>
quite
filthily
!
<EOS>
O
what
vile
hands
am
I
put
into
!
  
<EOS>
Thursday
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
now
all
the
reason
that
can
be
,
to
apprehend
my
master
will
be
here
soon
;
for
the
servants
are
busy
in
setting
the
house
to
rights
;
and
a
stable
and
coach
-
house
are
cleaning
out
,
that
have
not
been
used
some
time
.
 
<EOS>
I
asked
Mrs.
Jewkes
;
but
she
tells
me
nothing
,
nor
will
hardly
answer
me
when
I
ask
her
a
question
.
 
<EOS>
Sometimes
I
think
she
puts
on
these
strange
wicked
airs
to
me
,
purposely
to
make
me
wish
for
,
what
I
dread
most
of
all
things
,
my
master
's
coming
down
.
 
<EOS>
He
talk
of
love
!
 
<EOS>
If
he
had
any
the
least
notion
of
regard
for
me
,
to
be
sure
he
would
not
give
this
naughty
body
such
power
over
me
:
 
<EOS>
And
if
he
does
come
,
where
is
his
promise
of
not
seeing
me
without
I
consent
to
it
?
 
<EOS>
But
,
it
seems
,
his
honour
owes
me
nothing
!
 
<EOS>
So
he
tells
me
in
his
letter
.
 
<EOS>
And
why
?
 
<EOS>
Because
I
am
willing
to
keep
mine
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
indeed
,
he
says
,
he
hates
me
perfectly
:
<EOS>
But
it
is
plain
he
does
,
or
I
should
not
be
left
to
the
mercy
of
this
woman
:
and
,
what
is
worse
,
to
my
woful
apprehensions
.
  
<EOS>
Friday
,
the
36th
day
of
my
imprisonment
.
  
<EOS>
I
took
the
liberty
yesterday
afternoon
,
finding
the
gates
open
,
to
walk
out
before
the
house
;
and
,
ere
I
was
aware
,
had
got
to
the
bottom
of
the
long
row
of
elms
;
and
there
I
sat
myself
down
upon
the
steps
of
a
sort
of
broad
stile
,
which
leads
into
the
road
,
and
goes
towards
the
town
.
 
<EOS>
And
as
I
sat
musing
upon
what
always
busies
my
mind
,
I
saw
a
whole
body
of
folks
running
towards
me
from
the
house
,
men
and
women
,
as
in
a
fright
.
<EOS>
At
first
I
wondered
what
was
the
matter
,
till
they
came
nearer
;
and
I
found
they
were
all
alarmed
,
thinking
I
had
attempted
to
get
off
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
first
the
horrible
Colbrand
,
running
with
his
long
legs
,
<EOS>
well
nigh
two
yards
at
a
stride
<EOS>
;
then
there
was
one
of
the
grooms
,
poor
Mr.
Williams
's
robber
;
then
I
spied
Nan
,
half
out
of
breath
,
and
the
cook
-
maid
after
her
!
<EOS>
and
lastly
,
came
waddling
,
as
fast
as
she
could
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
exclaiming
most
bitterly
,
as
I
found
,
against
me
.
 
<EOS>
Colbrand
said
,
O
how
have
you
frighted
us
all
!
 
<EOS>
And
went
behind
me
,
lest
I
should
run
away
,
as
I
suppose
.
  
<EOS>
I
sat
still
,
to
let
them
see
I
had
no
view
to
get
away
;
for
,
besides
the
improbability
of
succeeding
,
my
last
sad
attempt
has
cured
me
of
enterprising
again
.
 
<EOS>
And
when
Mrs.
Jewkes
came
within
hearing
,
I
found
her
terribly
incensed
,
and
raving
about
my
contrivances
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
said
I
,
should
you
be
so
concerned
?
 
<EOS>
Here
I
have
sat
a
few
minutes
,
and
had
not
the
least
thought
of
getting
away
,
or
going
farther
;
but
to
return
as
soon
as
it
was
duskish
.
 
<EOS>
She
would
not
believe
me
;
and
the
barbarous
creature
struck
at
me
with
her
horrid
fist
,
and
,
I
believe
,
would
have
felled
me
,
had
not
Colbrand
interposed
,
and
said
,
He
saw
me
sitting
still
,
looking
about
me
,
and
not
seeming
to
have
the
least
inclination
to
stir
.
 
<EOS>
But
this
would
not
serve
:
She
ordered
the
two
maids
to
take
me
each
by
an
arm
,
and
lead
me
back
into
the
house
,
and
up
stairs
;
and
there
have
I
been
locked
up
ever
since
,
without
shoes
.
 
<EOS>
In
vain
have
I
pleaded
,
that
I
had
no
design
,
as
indeed
I
had
not
the
least
;
and
last
night
I
was
forced
to
be
between
her
and
Nan
;
and
I
find
she
is
resolved
to
make
a
handle
of
this
against
me
,
and
in
her
own
behalf
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
what
with
her
usage
,
and
my
own
apprehensions
of
still
worse
,
I
am
quite
weary
of
my
life
.
  
<EOS>
Just
now
she
has
been
with
me
,
and
given
me
my
shoes
,
and
has
laid
her
imperious
commands
upon
me
,
to
dress
myself
in
a
suit
of
clothes
out
of
the
portmanteau
,
which
I
have
not
seen
lately
,
against
three
or
four
o'clock
;
for
she
says
,
she
is
to
have
a
visit
from
Lady
Darnford
's
two
daughters
,
who
come
purposely
to
see
me
;
and
so
she
gave
me
the
key
of
the
portmanteau
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
will
not
obey
her
;
and
I
told
her
,
I
would
not
be
made
a
show
of
,
nor
see
the
ladies
.
 
<EOS>
She
left
me
,
saying
,
it
would
be
worse
for
me
,
if
I
did
not
.
 
<EOS>
But
how
can
that
be
?
  
<EOS>
Five
o'clock
is
come
,
  
And
no
young
ladies
!
 
<EOS>
So
that
I
fancy
 
But
hold
!
 
<EOS>
I
hear
their
coach
,
I
believe
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
step
to
the
window
.
 
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
go
down
to
them
,
I
am
resolved
   
Good
sirs
!
<EOS>
good
sirs
!
 
<EOS>
What
will
become
of
me
!
 
<EOS>
Here
is
my
master
come
in
his
fine
chariot
!
 
<EOS>
Indeed
he
is
!
 
<EOS>
What
shall
I
do
?
 
<EOS>
Where
shall
I
hide
myself
?
 
<EOS>
O
!
<EOS>
What
shall
I
do
?
 
<EOS>
Pray
for
me
!
 
<EOS>
But
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
you
'll
not
see
this
!
  
<EOS>
N
ow
,
good
God
of
heaven
,
preserve
me
;
if
it
be
thy
blessed
will
!
  
<EOS>
Seven
o'clock
.
  
<EOS>
Though
I
dread
to
see
him
,
yet
do
I
wonder
I
have
not
.
 
<EOS>
To
be
sure
something
is
resolved
against
me
,
and
he
stays
to
hear
all
her
stories
.
<EOS>
I
can
hardly
write
;
yet
,
as
I
can
do
nothing
else
,
I
know
not
how
to
forbear
!
 
<EOS>
Yet
I
can
not
hold
my
pen
 
<EOS>
How
crooked
and
trembling
the
lines
!
  
<EOS>
I
 
must
leave
off
,
till
I
can
get
quieter
fingers
!
 
<EOS>
Why
should
the
guiltless
tremble
<EOS>
so
,
when
the
guilty
can
possess
their
minds
in
peace
?
  
<EOS>
Saturday
morning
.
  
<EOS>
Now
let
me
give
you
an
account
of
what
passed
last
night
:
for
I
had
no
power
to
write
,
nor
yet
opportunity
till
now
.
  
<EOS>
This
vile
woman
held
my
master
till
half
an
hour
after
seven
;
and
he
came
hither
about
five
in
the
afternoon
.
 
<EOS>
And
then
I
heard
his
voice
on
the
stairs
,
as
he
was
coming
up
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
about
his
supper
;
for
he
said
,
I
shall
choose
a
boiled
chicken
with
butter
and
parsley
.
 
<EOS>
And
up
he
came
!
  
<EOS>
He
put
on
a
stern
and
majestic
air
;
and
he
can
look
very
majestic
when
he
pleases
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
perverse
Pamela
,
ungrateful
runaway
,
said
he
,
for
my
first
salutation
!
 
<EOS>
You
do
well
,
do
n't
you
,
to
give
me
all
this
trouble
and
vexation
!
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
speak
;
but
throwing
myself
on
the
floor
,
hid
my
face
,
and
was
ready
to
die
with
grief
and
apprehension
.
 
<EOS>
He
said
,
Well
may
you
hide
your
face
!
<EOS>
well
may
you
be
ashamed
to
see
me
,
vile
forward
one
,
as
you
are
!
 
<EOS>
I
sobbed
and
wept
,
but
could
not
speak
.
 
<EOS>
And
he
let
me
lie
,
and
went
to
the
door
,
and
called
Mrs.
Jewkes
.
 
<EOS>
There
,
said
he
,
take
up
that
fallen
angel
!
 
<EOS>
Once
I
thought
her
as
innocent
as
an
angel
of
light
<EOS>
but
I
have
now
no
patience
with
her
.
 
<EOS>
The
little
hypocrite
prostrates
herself
thus
,
in
hopes
to
move
my
weakness
in
her
favour
,
and
that
I
'll
raise
her
from
the
floor
myself
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
shall
not
touch
her
:
<EOS>
No
,
said
he
,
cruel
gentleman
as
he
was
!
<EOS>
let
such
fellows
as
Williams
be
taken
in
by
her
artful
wiles
!
 
<EOS>
I
know
her
now
,
and
see
she
is
for
any
fool
's
turn
,
that
will
be
caught
by
her
.
  
<EOS>
I
sighed
,
as
if
my
heart
would
break
!
 
<EOS>
And
Mrs.
Jewkes
lifted
me
up
upon
my
knees
;
for
I
trembled
so
,
I
could
not
stand
.
 
<EOS>
Come
,
said
she
,
Mrs.
Pamela
,
learn
to
know
your
best
friend
;
confess
your
unworthy
behaviour
,
and
beg
his
honour
's
forgiveness
of
all
your
faults
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
ready
to
faint
:
<EOS>
And
he
said
,
She
is
mistress
of
arts
,
I
'll
assure
you
;
and
will
mimic
a
fit
,
ten
to
one
,
in
a
minute
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
struck
to
the
heart
at
this
;
but
could
not
speak
presently
;
only
lifted
up
my
eyes
to
heaven
!
 
<EOS>
And
at
last
made
shift
to
say
 
God
forgive
you
,
sir
!
 
<EOS>
He
seemed
in
a
great
passion
,
and
walked
up
and
down
the
room
,
casting
sometimes
an
eye
upon
me
,
and
seeming
as
if
he
would
have
spoken
,
but
checked
himself
 
<EOS>
And
at
last
he
said
,
When
she
has
acted
this
her
first
part
over
,
perhaps
I
will
see
her
again
,
and
she
shall
soon
know
what
she
has
to
trust
to
.
  
<EOS>
And
so
he
went
out
of
the
room
:
<EOS>
And
I
was
quite
sick
at
heart
!
 
<EOS>
Surely
,
said
I
,
I
am
the
wickedest
creature
that
ever
breathed
!
 
<EOS>
Well
,
said
the
impertinent
,
not
so
wicked
as
that
neither
;
but
I
am
glad
you
begin
to
see
your
faults
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
like
being
humble
!
 
<EOS>
Come
,
I
'll
stand
your
friend
,
and
plead
for
you
,
if
you
'll
promise
to
be
more
dutiful
for
the
future
:
<EOS>
Come
,
come
,
added
the
wretch
,
this
may
be
all
made
up
by
to
-
morrow
morning
,
if
you
are
not
a
fool
.
 
<EOS>
Begone
,
hideous
woman
!
<EOS>
said
I
,
and
let
not
my
affliction
be
added
to
by
thy
inexorable
cruelty
,
and
unwomanly
wickedness
.
  
<EOS>
She
gave
me
a
push
,
and
went
away
in
a
violent
passion
:
<EOS>
And
it
seems
,
she
made
a
story
of
this
;
and
said
,
I
had
such
a
spirit
,
there
was
no
bearing
it
.
  
<EOS>
I
laid
me
down
on
the
floor
,
and
had
no
power
to
stir
,
till
the
clock
struck
nine
:
and
then
the
wicked
woman
came
up
again
.
 
<EOS>
You
must
come
down
stairs
,
said
she
,
to
my
master
;
that
is
,
if
you
please
,
spirit
!
 
<EOS>
Said
I
<EOS>
,
I
believe
I
can
not
stand
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
said
she
,
I
'll
send
Mons
.
<EOS>
Colbrand
to
carry
you
down
.
  
<EOS>
I
got
up
as
well
as
I
could
,
and
trembled
all
the
way
down
stairs
:
<EOS>
And
she
went
before
me
into
the
parlour
;
and
a
new
servant
that
he
had
waiting
on
him
,
instead
of
John
,
withdrew
as
soon
as
I
came
in
:
<EOS>
And
,
by
the
way
,
he
had
a
new
coachman
too
,
which
looked
as
if
Bedfordshire
Robin
was
turned
away
.
  
<EOS>
I
thought
,
said
he
,
when
I
came
down
,
you
should
have
sat
at
table
with
me
,
when
I
had
not
company
;
but
when
I
find
you
can
not
forget
your
original
,
but
must
prefer
my
menials
to
me
,
I
call
you
down
to
wait
on
me
while
I
sup
,
that
I
may
have
some
talk
with
you
,
and
throw
away
as
little
time
as
possible
upon
you
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
,
said
I
,
you
do
me
honour
to
wait
upon
you
:
 
<EOS>
And
I
never
shall
<EOS>
,
I
hope
,
forget
my
original
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
was
forced
to
stand
behind
his
chair
,
that
I
might
hold
by
it
.
 
<EOS>
Fill
me
,
said
he
,
a
glass
of
that
Burgundy
.
 
<EOS>
I
went
to
do
it
,
but
my
hand
shook
so
,
that
I
could
not
hold
the
plate
with
the
glass
in
it
,
and
spilt
some
of
the
wine
.
 
<EOS>
So
Mrs.
Jewkes
poured
it
for
me
,
and
I
carried
it
as
well
as
I
could
;
and
made
a
low
courtesy
.
 
<EOS>
He
took
it
,
and
said
,
Stand
behind
me
,
out
of
my
sight
!
  
<EOS>
Why
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
said
he
,
you
tell
me
she
remains
very
sullen
still
,
and
eats
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
said
she
,
not
so
much
as
will
keep
life
and
soul
together
.
 
<EOS>
And
is
always
crying
,
you
say
,
too
?
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
sir
,
answered
she
,
I
think
she
is
,
for
one
thing
or
another
.
 
<EOS>
Ay
,
said
he
,
your
young
wenches
will
feed
upon
their
tears
;
and
their
obstinacy
will
serve
them
for
meat
and
drink
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
never
saw
her
look
better
though
,
in
my
life
!
 
<EOS>
But
,
I
suppose
,
she
lives
upon
love
.
 
<EOS>
This
sweet
Mr.
Williams
,
and
her
little
villanous
plots
together
,
have
kept
her
alive
and
well
,
to
be
sure
:
For
mischief
,
love
,
and
contradiction
,
are
the
natural
aliments
of
a
woman
.
  
<EOS>
Poor
I
was
forced
to
hear
all
this
,
and
be
silent
;
and
indeed
my
heart
was
too
full
to
speak
.
  
<EOS>
And
so
you
say
,
said
he
,
that
she
had
another
project
,
but
yesterday
,
to
get
away
?
 
<EOS>
She
denies
it
herself
,
said
she
;
but
it
had
all
the
appearance
of
one
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
sure
she
made
me
in
a
fearful
pucker
about
it
:
<EOS>
And
I
am
glad
your
honour
is
come
,
with
all
my
heart
;
and
I
hope
,
whatever
be
your
honour
's
intention
concerning
her
,
you
will
not
be
long
about
it
;
for
you
'll
find
her
as
slippery
as
an
eel
,
I
'll
assure
you
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
,
said
I
,
and
clasped
his
knees
with
my
arms
,
not
knowing
what
I
did
,
and
falling
on
my
knees
,
Have
mercy
on
me
,
and
hear
me
,
concerning
that
wicked
woman
's
usage
of
me
   
<EOS>
He
cruelly
interrupted
me
,
and
said
,
I
am
satisfied
she
has
done
her
duty
:
it
signifies
nothing
what
you
say
against
Mrs.
Jewkes
.
 
<EOS>
That
you
are
here
,
little
hypocrite
as
you
are
,
pleading
your
cause
before
me
,
is
owing
to
her
care
of
you
;
else
you
had
been
with
the
parson
.
 
<EOS>
Wicked
girl
!
<EOS>
said
he
,
to
tempt
a
man
to
undo
himself
,
as
you
have
done
him
,
at
a
time
I
was
on
the
point
of
making
him
happy
for
his
life
!
  
<EOS>
I
arose
;
but
said
with
a
deep
sigh
,
I
have
done
,
sir
!
 
<EOS>
I
have
done
!
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
strange
tribunal
to
plead
before
.
 
<EOS>
The
poor
sheep
in
the
fable
had
such
an
one
;
when
it
was
tried
before
the
vulture
,
on
the
accusation
of
the
wolf
!
  
<EOS>
So
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
said
he
,
you
are
the
wolf
,
I
the
vulture
,
and
this
the
poor
innocent
lamb
on
her
trial
before
us
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
you
do
n't
know
how
well
this
innocent
is
read
in
reflection
.
 
<EOS>
She
has
wit
at
will
,
when
she
has
a
mind
to
display
her
own
romantic
innocence
,
at
the
price
of
other
people
's
characters
.
  
<EOS>
Well
,
said
the
aggravated
creature
,
this
is
nothing
to
what
she
has
called
me
<EOS>
:
I
have
been
a
Jezebel
,
a
London
prostitute
,
and
what
not
?
 
<EOS>
But
I
am
contented
with
her
ill
names
<EOS>
,
now
I
see
it
is
her
fashion
,
and
she
can
call
your
honour
a
vulture
.
  
<EOS>
Said
I
<EOS>
,
I
had
no
thought
of
comparing
my
master
 
and
was
going
to
say
on
:
but
he
said
,
Do
n't
prate
,
girl
!
 
<EOS>
No
,
said
she
,
it
do
n't
become
you
,
I
am
sure
.
  
<EOS>
Well
,
said
I
,
since
I
must
not
speak
,
I
will
hold
my
peace
;
but
there
is
a
righteous
Judge
,
who
knows
the
secrets
of
all
hearts
;
and
to
him
I
appeal
.
  
<EOS>
See
there
!
<EOS>
said
he
:
now
this
meek
,
good
creature
is
praying
for
fire
from
heaven
upon
us
!
 
<EOS>
O
she
can
curse
most
heartily
,
in
the
spirit
of
Christian
meekness
,
I
'll
assure
you
!
 
<EOS>
Come
,
saucy
-
face
,
give
me
another
glass
of
wine
.
  
<EOS>
So
I
did
,
as
well
as
I
could
;
but
wept
so
,
that
he
said
,
I
suppose
I
shall
have
some
of
your
tears
in
my
wine
!
  
<EOS>
When
he
had
supped
,
he
stood
up
,
and
said
,
O
how
happy
for
you
it
is
,
that
you
can
,
at
will
,
thus
make
your
speaking
eyes
overflow
in
this
manner
,
without
losing
any
of
their
brilliancy
!
 
<EOS>
You
have
been
told
,
I
suppose
,
that
you
are
most
beautiful
in
your
tears
!
 
<EOS>
Did
you
ever
,
said
he
to
her
,
(
who
all
this
while
was
standing
in
one
corner
of
the
parlour
,
)
see
a
more
charming
creature
than
this
?
 
<EOS>
Is
it
to
be
wondered
at
,
that
I
demean
myself
thus
to
take
notice
of
her
?
 
<EOS>
See
,
said
he
,
and
took
the
glass
with
one
hand
,
and
turned
me
round
with
the
other
,
what
a
shape
!
<EOS>
what
a
neck
!
<EOS>
what
a
hand
!
<EOS>
and
what
a
bloom
on
that
lovely
face
!
  
<EOS>
But
who
can
describe
the
tricks
and
artifices
,
that
lie
lurking
in
her
little
,
plotting
,
guileful
heart
!
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
no
wonder
the
poor
parson
was
infatuated
with
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
blame
him
less
than
I
do
her
;
for
who
could
expect
such
artifice
in
so
young
a
sorceress
?
  
<EOS>
I
went
to
the
farther
part
of
the
room
,
and
held
my
face
against
the
wainscot
;
and
in
spite
of
all
I
could
do
to
refrain
crying
,
sobbed
as
if
my
heart
would
break
.
 
<EOS>
He
said
,
I
am
surprised
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
at
the
mistake
of
the
letters
you
tell
me
of
!
 
<EOS>
But
,
you
see
,
I
am
not
afraid
any
body
should
read
what
I
write
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
carry
on
private
correspondences
,
and
reveal
every
secret
that
comes
to
my
knowledge
,
and
then
corrupt
people
to
carry
my
letters
against
their
duty
,
and
all
good
conscience
.
  
<EOS>
Come
hither
,
hussy
!
<EOS>
said
he
:
<EOS>
You
and
I
have
a
dreadful
reckoning
to
make
.
<EOS>
Why
do
n't
you
come
,
when
I
bid
you
?
 
<EOS>
Fie
upon
it
,
Mrs.
Pamela
,
said
she
.
<EOS>
What
!
<EOS>
not
stir
,
when
his
honour
commands
you
to
come
to
him
!
 
<EOS>
Who
knows
but
his
goodness
will
forgive
you
?
  
<EOS>
He
came
to
me
,
(
for
I
had
no
power
to
stir
,
)
and
put
his
arms
about
my
neck
,
and
would
kiss
me
;
and
said
,
<EOS>
Well
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
if
it
were
not
for
the
thought
of
this
cursed
parson
,
I
believe
in
my
heart
,
so
great
is
my
weakness
,
that
I
could
not
forgive
this
intriguing
little
slut
,
and
take
her
to
my
bosom
.
  
<EOS>
O
,
said
the
sycophant
,
you
are
very
good
,
sir
,
very
forgiving
,
indeed
!
  
<EOS>
But
come
,
added
the
profligate
wretch
<EOS>
,
I
hope
you
will
be
so
good
,
as
to
take
her
to
your
bosom
;
and
that
,
by
to
-
morrow
morning
,
you
'll
bring
her
to
a
better
sense
of
her
duty
!
  
<EOS>
Could
any
thing
in
womanhood
be
so
vile
?
 
<EOS>
I
had
no
patience
:
but
yet
grief
and
indignation
choaked
up
the
passage
of
my
words
;
and
I
could
only
stammer
out
a
passionate
exclamation
to
Heaven
,
to
protect
my
innocence
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
word
was
the
subject
of
their
ridicule
.
 
<EOS>
Was
ever
poor
creature
<EOS>
worse
beset
!
  
<EOS>
He
said
,
as
if
he
had
been
considering
whether
he
could
forgive
me
or
not
,
No
,
I
can
not
yet
forgive
her
neither
.
 
<EOS>
She
has
given
me
great
disturbance
<EOS>
,
has
brought
great
discredit
upon
me
,
both
abroad
and
at
home
:
has
corrupted
all
my
servants
at
the
other
house
;
has
despised
my
honourable
views
and
intentions
to
her
,
and
sought
to
run
away
with
this
ungrateful
parson
.
 
<EOS>
And
surely
I
ought
not
to
forgive
all
this
!
 
<EOS>
Yet
,
with
all
this
wretched
grimace
,
he
kissed
me
again
,
and
would
have
put
his
hand
into
my
bosom
;
but
I
struggled
,
and
said
,
I
would
die
before
I
would
be
used
thus
.
 
<EOS>
Consider
,
Pamela
,
said
he
,
in
a
threatening
tone
,
consider
where
you
are
!
<EOS>
and
do
n't
play
the
fool
:
If
you
do
,
a
more
dreadful
fate
awaits
you
than
you
expect
.
 
<EOS>
But
take
her
up
stairs
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
and
I
'll
send
a
few
lines
to
her
to
consider
of
;
and
let
me
have
your
answer
,
Pamela
,
in
the
morning
.
  
<EOS>
'
<EOS>
Till
then
you
have
to
resolve
:
and
after
that
your
doom
is
fixed
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
went
up
stairs
,
and
gave
myself
up
to
grief
,
and
expectation
of
what
he
would
send
:
<EOS>
but
yet
I
was
glad
of
this
night
's
reprieve
!
  
<EOS>
He
sent
me
,
however
,
nothing
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
And
about
twelve
o'clock
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
and
Nan
came
up
,
as
the
night
before
,
to
be
my
bed
-
fellows
:
and
I
would
go
to
bed
with
some
of
my
clothes
on
:
which
they
muttered
at
sadly
;
and
Mrs.
Jewkes
railed
at
me
particularly
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
I
would
have
sat
up
all
night
,
for
fear
,
if
she
would
have
let
me
.
 
<EOS>
For
I
had
but
<EOS>
very
little
rest
that
night
,
apprehending
this
woman
would
let
my
master
in
.
 
<EOS>
She
did
nothing
but
praise
him
,
and
blame
me
:
but
I
answered
her
as
little
as
I
could
.
  
<EOS>
He
has
Sir
Simon
Tell
-
tale
,
alias
Darnford
,
to
dine
with
him
to
-
day
,
whose
family
sent
to
welcome
him
into
the
country
;
and
it
seems
the
old
knight
wants
to
see
me
;
so
I
suppose
I
shall
be
sent
for
,
as
Samson
was
,
to
make
sport
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
Here
I
am
,
and
must
bear
it
all
!
  
<EOS>
Twelve
o'clock
,
Saturday
noon
.
  
<EOS>
Just
now
he
has
sent
me
up
,
by
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
the
following
proposals
.
 
<EOS>
So
here
are
the
honourable
intentions
all
at
once
laid
open
.
 
<EOS>
They
are
,
my
dear
parents
,
to
make
me
a
vile
kept
mistress
:
which
,
I
hope
,
I
shall
always
detest
the
thoughts
of
.
 
<EOS>
But
you
'll
see
how
they
are
accommodated
to
what
I
should
have
most
desired
,
could
I
have
honestly
promoted
it
,
your
welfare
and
happiness
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
answered
them
,
as
I
am
sure
you
'll
approve
;
and
I
am
prepared
for
the
worst
:
<EOS>
For
though
I
fear
there
will
be
nothing
omitted
to
ruin
me
,
and
though
my
poor
strength
will
not
be
able
to
defend
me
,
yet
I
will
be
innocent
of
crime
in
my
intention
,
and
in
the
sight
of
God
;
and
to
him
leave
the
avenging
of
all
my
wrongs
,
time
and
manner
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
write
to
you
my
answer
against
his
articles
;
and
hope
the
best
,
though
I
fear
the
worst
.
 
<EOS>
But
if
I
should
come
home
to
you
ruined
and
undone
,
and
may
not
be
able
to
look
you
in
the
face
;
yet
pity
and
inspirit
the
poor
Pamela
,
to
make
her
little
remnant
of
life
easy
;
for
long
I
shall
not
survive
my
disgrace
:
and
you
may
be
assured
it
shall
not
be
my
fault
,
if
it
be
my
misfortune
.

The
following
ARTICLES
are
proposed
to
your
serious
consideration
;
and
let
me
have
an
answer
,
in
writing
,
to
them
,
that
I
may
take
my
resolutions
accordingly
.
 
<EOS>
Only
remember
,
that
I
will
not
be
trifled
with
;
and
what
you
give
for
answer
will
absolutely
decide
your
fate

without
expostulation

or
farther
trouble

<EOS>
This
is
my
ANSWER

<EOS>
Forgive
,
sir
,
the
spirit
your
poor
servant
is
about
to
show
in
    
her
answer
to
your
ARTICLES
.
 
<EOS>
Not
to
be
warm
,
and
in
earnest
,
    
on
such
an
occasion
as
the
present
,
would
shew
a
degree
of
guilt
,
    
that
,
I
hope
,
my
soul
abhors
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
not
trifle
with
you
,
nor
    
act
like
a
person
doubtful
of
her
own
mind
;
for
it
wants
not
one
    
moment
's
consideration
with
me
;
and
I
therefore
return
the
ANSWER
    
following
,
let
what
will
be
the
consequence
.
  
<EOS>
"
I.
 
If
you
can
convince
me
that
the
hated
parson
has
had
no
encouragement
from
you
in
his
addresses
;
and
that
you
have
no
inclination
for
him
in
preference
to
me
;
then
I
will
offer
the
following
proposals
to
you
,
which
I
will
punctually
make
good
.
      
<EOS>
I.
 
<EOS>
As
to
the
first
article
,
sir
,
it
may
behove
me
<EOS>
(
that
I
may
    
not
deserve
,
in
your
opinion
,
the
opprobrious
terms
of
forward
    
and
artful
,
and
such
like
)
to
declare
solemnly
,
that
Mr.
Williams
    
never
had
the
least
encouragement
from
me
,
as
to
what
you
hint
;
    
and
I
believe
his
principal
motive
was
the
apprehended
duty
of
his
    
function
,
quite
contrary
to
his
apparent
interest
,
to
assist
a
    
person
he
thought
in
distress
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
<EOS>
,
sir
,
the
rather
believe
    
me
,
when
I
declare
,
that
I
know
not
the
man
breathing
I
would
wish
    
to
marry
;
and
that
the
only
one
I
could
honour
more
than
another
,
    
is
the
gentleman
,
who
,
of
all
others
,
seeks
my
everlasting
dishonour
.

<EOS>
I
will
directly
make
you
a
present
of
500
guineas
,
for
your
own
use

which
you
may
dispose
 
of
to
any
purpose
you
please
:
and
will
give
it
absolutely
into
the
hands
of
any
person
you
shall
appoint
to
receive
it
;
and
expect
no
favour
in
return

you
are
satisfied
in
the
possession
of
it

As
to
your
second
proposal
,
let
the
consequence
be
what
it
    
will
,
I
reject
it
with
all
my
soul
.
 
<EOS>
Money
,
sir
,
is
not
my
chief
    
good
:
<EOS>
May
God
Almighty
desert
me
,
whenever
it
is
!
<EOS>
and
whenever
,
    
for
the
sake
of
that
,
I
can
give
up
my
title
to
that
blessed
hope
    
which
will
stand
me
in
stead
,
at
a
time
when
millions
of
gold
will
    
not
purchase
one
happy
moment
of
reflection
on
a
past
misspent
life
!

<EOS>
I
will
likewise
directly
make
over
to
you
a
purchase
I
lately
made
in
Kent
,
which
brings
in
250l
.
<EOS>
per
annum
,
clear
of
all
deductions
.
 
<EOS>
This
shall
be
made
over
to
you
in
full
property
for
your
life
,
and
for
the
lives
of
any
children
to
perpetuity
,
that
you
may
happen
to
have
:
<EOS>
And
your
father
shall
be
immediately
put
into
possession
of
it
in
trust
for
these
purposes
:
and
the
management
of
it
will
yield
a
comfortable
subsistence
to
him
,
and
your
mother
,
for
life
;
and
I
will
make
up
any
deficiencies
,
if
such
should
happen
,
to
that
clear
sum
,
and
allow
him
50l
.
<EOS>
per
annum
,
besides
,
for
his
life
,
and
that
of
your
mother
,
for
his
care
and
management
of
this
your
estate

<EOS>
Your
third
proposal
<EOS>
,
sir
,
I
reject
for
the
same
reason
;
    
and
am
sorry
you
could
think
my
poor
honest
parents
would
enter
    
into
their
part
of
it
,
and
be
concerned
for
the
management
of
    
an
estate
,
which
would
be
owing
to
the
prostitution
of
their
    
poor
daughter
.
 
<EOS>
Forgive
,
sir
,
my
warmth
on
this
occasion
;
but
    
you
know
not
the
poor
man
,
and
the
poor
woman
,
my
ever
-
dear
    
father
and
mother
,
if
you
think
,
that
they
would
not
much
rather
    
choose
to
starve
in
a
ditch
,
or
rot
in
a
noisome
dungeon
,
than
    
accept
of
the
fortune
of
a
monarch
,
upon
such
wicked
terms
.
    
<EOS>
I
dare
not
say
all
that
my
full
mind
suggests
to
me
on
this
    
grievous
occasion
 
<EOS>
But
,
indeed
,
sir
,
you
know
them
not
;
nor
    
shall
the
terrors
of
death
,
in
its
most
frightful
form
,
I
hope
,
    
through
God
's
assisting
grace
,
ever
make
me
act
unworthy
of
    
such
poor
honest
parents
!

"
IV
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
,
moreover
,
extend
my
favour
to
any
other
of
your
relations

that
you
may
think
worthy
of
it
,
or
that
are
valued
by
you

<EOS>
Your
fourth
proposal
<EOS>
,
I
take
upon
me
,
sir
,
to
answer
as
the
    
third
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
have
any
friends
that
want
the
favour
of
the
great
,
    
may
they
ever
want
it
,
if
they
are
capable
of
desiring
it
on
    
unworthy
terms
!
  
<EOS>
"
V.
 
I
will
,
besides
,
order
patterns
to
be
sent
you
for
choosing
four
complete
suits
of
rich
clothes
,
that
you
may
appear
with
reputation
,
as
if
you
were
my
wife
.
 
<EOS>
And
will
give
you
the
two
diamond
rings
,
and
two
pair
of
ear
-
rings
,
and
diamond
necklace
,
that
were
bought
by
my
mother
,
to
present
to
Miss
Tomlins
,
if
the
match
that
was
proposed
between
her
<EOS>
and
me
had
been
brought
to
effect
:
<EOS>
and
I
will
confer
upon
you
still
other
gratuities
,
as
I
shall
find
myself
obliged
,
by
your
good
behaviour
and
affection
.
      
<EOS>
V.
 
Fine
clothes
,
sir
,
become
not
me
;
nor
have
I
any
ambition
    
to
wear
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
greater
pride
in
my
poverty
and
meanness
,
    
than
I
should
have
in
dress
and
finery
.
 
<EOS>
Believe
me
,
<EOS>
sir
,
I
think
    
such
things
less
become
the
humble
-
born
Pamela
,
than
the
rags
    
<EOS>
your
good
mother
raised
me
from
.
 
<EOS>
Your
rings
,
sir
,
your
necklace
,
    
and
your
ear
-
rings
,
will
better
befit
ladies
of
degree
,
than
me
:
    
and
to
lose
the
best
jewel
,
my
virtue
,
would
be
poorly
recompensed
    
by
those
you
propose
to
give
me
.
 
<EOS>
What
should
I
think
,
when
I
    
looked
upon
my
finger
,
or
saw
in
the
glass
those
diamonds
on
my
    
neck
,
and
in
my
ears
,
but
that
they
were
the
price
of
my
honesty
;
    
and
that
I
wore
those
jewels
outwardly
,
because
I
had
none
inwardly
.

VI

<EOS>
Now
,
Pamela
,
will
you
see
by
this
,
what
a
value
I
set
upon
the
free
-
will
of
a
person
already
in
my
power
;
and
who
,
if
these
proposals
are
not
accepted
,
shall
find
,
that
I
have
not
taken
all
these
pains
,
and
risked
my
reputation
,
as
I
have
done
,
without
resolving
to
gratify
my
passion
for
you
,
at
all
adventures
;
and
if
you
refuse
,
without
making
any
terms
at
all
.
      
<EOS>
VI
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
,
sir
,
by
woful
experience
,
that
I
am
in
your
power
:
    
<EOS>
I
know
all
the
resistance
I
can
make
will
be
poor
and
weak
,
and
,
    
perhaps
,
stand
me
in
little
stead
:
I
dread
your
will
to
ruin
me
    
is
as
great
as
your
power
:
yet
,
sir
,
will
I
dare
to
tell
you
,
    
that
I
will
make
no
free
-
will
offering
of
my
virtue
.
 
<EOS>
All
that
    
I
can
do
,
poor
as
it
is
,
I
will
do
,
to
convince
you
,
that
your
    
offers
shall
have
no
part
in
my
choice
;
and
if
I
can
not
escape
    
the
violence
of
man
,
I
hope
,
by
God
's
grace
,
I
shall
have
nothing
    
to
reproach
myself
,
for
not
doing
all
in
my
power
to
avoid
my
    
disgrace
;
and
then
I
can
safely
appeal
to
the
great
God
,
my
only
    
refuge
and
protector
,
with
this
consolation
,
That
my
will
bore
no
    
part
in
my
violation
.
  
<EOS>
"
VII
.
 
<EOS>
You
shall
be
mistress
of
my
person
and
fortune
,
as
much
as
if
the
foolish
ceremony
had
passed
.
 
<EOS>
All
my
servants
shall
be
yours
;
and
you
shall
choose
any
two
persons
to
attend
yourself
,
either
male
or
female
,
without
any
control
of
mine
:
and
if
your
conduct
be
such
,
that
I
have
reason
to
be
satisfied
with
it
,
<EOS>
I
know
not
<EOS>
(
but
will
not
engage
for
this
)
<EOS>
that
I
may
,
after
a
twelvemonth
's
cohabitation
,
marry
you
;
for
,
if
my
love
increases
for
you
,
as
it
has
done
for
many
months
past
,
it
will
be
impossible
for
me
to
deny
you
any
thing
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
now
,
Pamela
,
consider
well
,
it
is
in
your
power
to
oblige
me
on
such
terms
,
as
will
make
yourself
,
and
all
your
friends
,
happy
:
but
this
will
be
over
this
very
day
,
irrevocably
over
;
and
you
shall
find
all
you
would
be
thought
to
fear
,
without
the
least
benefit
arising
from
it
to
yourself
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
beg
you
'll
well
weigh
the
matter
,
and
comply
with
my
proposals
;
and
I
will
instantly
set
about
securing
to
you
the
full
effect
of
them
:
And
let
me
,
if
you
value
yourself
,
experience
a
grateful
return
on
this
occasion

I
'll
forgive
all
that
's
past

.
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
once
dared
to
look
so
high
,
as
to
such
a
    
proposal
as
your
seventh
article
contains
.
 
<EOS>
Hence
have
proceeded
    
all
my
little
abortive
artifices
to
escape
from
the
confinement
    
you
have
put
me
in
;
although
you
promised
to
be
honourable
to
me
.
    
<EOS>
Your
honour
,
well
I
know
,
would
not
let
you
stoop
to
<EOS>
so
mean
and
    
so
unworthy
<EOS>
a
slave
,
as
the
poor
Pamela
:
All
I
desire
is
,
to
be
    
permitted
to
return
to
my
native
meanness
unviolated
.
 
<EOS>
What
have
    
<EOS>
I
done
,
sir
,
to
deserve
it
<EOS>
should
be
otherwise
?
 
<EOS>
For
the
obtaining
    
of
this
,
though
I
would
not
have
married
your
chaplain
,
yet
would
    
I
have
run
away
with
your
meanest
servant
,
if
I
had
thought
I
could
    
have
got
safe
to
my
beloved
poverty
.
 
<EOS>
I
heard
you
once
say
,
sir
,
    
That
a
certain
great
commander
,
who
could
live
upon
lentils
,
might
    
well
refuse
the
bribes
of
the
greatest
monarch
:
<EOS>
And
I
hope
,
as
I
    
can
contentedly
live
at
the
meanest
rate
,
and
think
not
myself
    
above
the
lowest
condition
,
that
I
am
also
above
making
an
exchange
    
of
my
honesty
for
all
the
riches
of
the
Indies
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
come
to
be
    
proud
and
vain
of
gaudy
apparel
,
and
outside
finery
,
then
(
which
I
    
hope
will
never
be
)
<EOS>
may
I
rest
my
principal
good
in
such
vain
    
trinkets
,
and
despise
for
them
the
more
solid
ornaments
of
a
good
    
fame
,
and
a
chastity
inviolate
!
  
<EOS>
Give
me
leave
to
say
,
sir
,
in
answer
to
what
you
hint
,
That
you
may
in
a
twelvemonth
's
time
marry
me
,
on
the
continuance
of
my
good
behaviour
;
that
this
weighs
less
with
me
,
if
possible
,
than
any
thing
else
you
have
said
:
for
,
in
the
first
place
,
there
is
an
end
of
all
merit
,
and
all
good
behaviour
,
on
my
side
,
if
I
have
now
any
,
the
moment
I
consent
to
your
proposals
:
And
I
should
be
so
far
from
expecting
such
an
honour
,
that
I
will
pronounce
,
that
I
should
be
most
unworthy
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
What
,
sir
,
would
the
world
say
,
were
you
to
marry
your
harlot
?
 
<EOS>
That
a
gentleman
of
your
rank
in
life
should
stoop
,
not
only
to
the
base
-
born
Pamela
,
but
to
a
base
-
born
prostitute
?
 
<EOS>
Little
,
sir
,
as
I
know
of
the
world
,
I
am
not
to
be
caught
by
a
bait
so
poorly
covered
as
this
!
  
<EOS>
Yet
,
after
all
,
dreadful
is
the
thought
,
that
I
,
a
poor
,
weak
,
friendless
,
unhappy
creature
,
am
too
full
in
your
power
!
 
<EOS>
But
permit
me
,
sir
,
to
pray
,
as
I
now
write
on
my
bended
knees
,
That
before
you
resolve
upon
my
ruin
,
you
will
weigh
well
the
matter
.
 
<EOS>
Hitherto
,
sir
,
though
you
have
taken
large
strides
to
this
crying
sin
,
yet
are
you
on
this
side
the
commission
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
When
once
it
is
done
,
nothing
can
recall
it
!
 
<EOS>
And
where
will
be
your
triumph
?
 
<EOS>
What
glory
will
the
spoils
of
such
a
weak
enemy
yield
you
?
 
<EOS>
Let
me
but
enjoy
my
poverty
with
honesty
,
is
all
my
prayer
,
and
I
will
bless
you
,
and
pray
for
you
,
every
moment
of
my
life
!
<EOS>
Think
,
O
think
!
<EOS>
before
it
is
yet
too
late
!
<EOS>
what
stings
,
what
remorse
will
attend
your
dying
hour
,
when
you
come
to
reflect
,
that
you
have
ruined
,
perhaps
soul
and
body
,
a
wretched
creature
,
whose
only
pride
was
her
virtue
!
 
<EOS>
And
how
pleased
you
will
be
,
on
the
contrary
,
if
in
that
tremendous
moment
you
shall
be
able
to
acquit
yourself
of
this
foul
crime
,
and
to
plead
in
your
own
behalf
,
that
you
suffered
the
earnest
supplications
of
an
unhappy
wretch
to
prevail
with
you
to
be
innocent
yourself
,
and
let
her
remain
so
!
 
<EOS>
May
God
Almighty
,
whose
mercy
so
lately
saved
you
from
the
peril
of
perishing
in
deep
waters
,
(
on
which
,
I
hope
,
you
will
give
me
cause
to
congratulate
you
!
)
<EOS>
touch
your
heart
in
my
favour
,
and
save
you
from
this
sin
,
and
me
from
this
ruin
!
 
<EOS>
And
to
him
do
I
commit
my
cause
;
and
to
him
will
I
give
the
glory
,
and
night
and
day
pray
for
you
,
if
I
may
be
permitted
to
escape
this
great
evil
!

Your
poor
oppressed
,
broken
spirited
servant

<EOS>
I
took
a
copy
of
this
for
your
perusal
,
my
dear
parents
,
if
I
shall
ever
be
so
happy
to
see
you
again
;
(
for
I
hope
my
conduct
will
be
approved
of
by
you

and
at
night
,
when
Sir
Simon
was
gone
,
he
sent
for
me
down
.
<EOS>
Well
,
said
he
,
have
you
considered
my
proposals
?
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
sir
,
said
I
,
<EOS>
I
have
:
<EOS>
and
there
is
my
answer
:
<EOS>
But
pray
let
me
not
see
you
read
it
.
 
<EOS>
Is
it
your
bashfulness
,
said
he
,
or
your
obstinacy
,
that
makes
you
not
choose
I
should
read
it
before
you
?
  
<EOS>
I
offered
to
go
away
;
and
he
said
,
Do
n't
run
from
me
;
I
wo
n't
read
it
till
you
are
gone
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
said
he
,
tell
me
,
Pamela
,
whether
you
comply
with
my
proposals
,
or
not
?
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
said
I
,
you
will
see
presently
;
pray
do
n't
hold
me
;
for
he
took
my
hand
.
 
<EOS>
Said
he
<EOS>
,
Did
you
well
consider
before
you
answered
?
 
<EOS>
I
did
,
sir
,
said
I.
 
If
it
be
not
what
you
think
will
please
me
,
said
he
,
dear
girl
,
take
it
back
again
,
and
reconsider
it
;
for
if
I
have
this
as
your
absolute
answer
,
and
I
do
n't
like
it
,
<EOS>
you
are
undone
;
for
I
will
not
sue
meanly
,
where
I
can
command
.
 
<EOS>
I
fear
,
said
he
,
it
is
not
what
I
like
,
by
your
manner
:
and
let
me
tell
you
,
that
I
can
not
bear
denial
.
 
<EOS>
If
the
terms
I
have
offered
are
not
sufficient
,
I
will
augment
them
to
two
-
thirds
of
my
estate
;
for
,
said
he
,
and
swore
a
dreadful
oath
,
I
can
not
live
without
you
:
and
,
since
the
thing
is
gone
so
far
,
I
will
not
!
 
<EOS>
And
so
he
clasped
me
in
his
arms
in
such
a
manner
as
quite
frightened
me
;
and
kissed
me
two
or
three
times
.
  
<EOS>
I
got
from
him
,
and
run
up
stairs
,
and
went
to
the
closet
,
and
was
quite
uneasy
and
fearful
.
  
<EOS>
In
an
hour
's
time
he
called
Mrs.
Jewkes
down
to
him
!
 
<EOS>
And
I
heard
him
very
high
in
passion
:
and
all
about
me
!
 
<EOS>
And
I
heard
her
say
<EOS>
,
It
was
his
own
fault
;
there
would
be
an
end
of
all
my
complaining
and
perverseness
,
if
he
was
once
resolved
;
and
other
most
impudent
aggravations
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
resolved
not
to
go
to
bed
this
night
,
if
I
can
help
it
!
 
<EOS>
Lie
still
,
lie
still
,
my
poor
fluttering
heart
!
 
<EOS>
What
will
become
of
me
!
  
<EOS>
Almost
twelve
o'clock
,
Saturday
night
.
  
<EOS>
He
sent
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
about
ten
o'clock
,
to
tell
me
to
come
to
him
.
<EOS>
Where
?
<EOS>
said
<EOS>
I.
 
I
'll
shew
you
,
said
she
.
 
<EOS>
I
went
down
three
or
four
steps
,
and
saw
her
making
to
his
chamber
,
<EOS>
the
door
of
which
was
open
:
<EOS>
So
I
said
,
I
can
not
go
there
!
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
be
foolish
,
said
she
;
but
come
;
no
harm
will
be
done
to
you
!
 
<EOS>
Well
,
said
I
,
if
I
die
,
I
can
not
go
there
.
 
<EOS>
I
heard
him
say
,
Let
her
come
,
or
it
shall
be
worse
for
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
bear
,
said
he
,
to
speak
to
her
myself
!
 
<EOS>
Well
,
said
I
,
I
can
not
come
,
indeed
I
can
not
;
and
<EOS>
so
I
went
up
again
into
my
closet
,
expecting
to
be
fetched
by
force
.
  
<EOS>
But
she
came
up
soon
after
,
and
bid
me
make
haste
to
bed
:
<EOS>
Said
I
,
<EOS>
I
will
not
go
to
bed
this
night
<EOS>
,
that
's
certain
!
 
<EOS>
Then
,
said
she
,
you
shall
be
made
to
come
to
bed
;
and
Nan
and
I
will
undress
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
knew
neither
prayers
nor
tears
would
move
this
wicked
woman
:
<EOS>
So
I
said
,
I
am
sure
you
will
let
master
in
,
and
I
shall
be
undone
!
 
<EOS>
Mighty
piece
of
undone
!
<EOS>
she
said
:
<EOS>
but
he
was
too
much
exasperated
against
me
,
to
be
so
familiar
with
me
,
she
would
assure
me
!
 
<EOS>
Ay
,
said
she
,
you
'll
be
disposed
of
another
way
soon
,
I
can
tell
you
for
your
comfort
:
and
I
hope
your
husband
will
have
your
obedience
,
though
nobody
else
can
have
it
.
 
<EOS>
No
husband
in
the
world
,
said
I
,
shall
make
me
do
an
unjust
or
base
thing
.
 
<EOS>
She
said
,
That
would
be
soon
tried
;
and
Nan
coming
in
,
What
!
<EOS>
said
I
,
am
I
to
have
two
bed
-
fellows
again
,
these
warm
nights
?
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
said
she
,
slippery
-
one
,
you
are
,
till
you
can
have
one
good
one
instead
of
us
.
 
<EOS>
Said
I
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
do
n't
talk
nastily
to
me
:
<EOS>
I
see
you
are
beginning
again
;
and
I
shall
affront
you
,
may
be
;
for
next
to
bad
actions
,
are
bad
words
;
for
they
could
not
be
spoken
,
if
they
were
not
in
the
heart
.
 
<EOS>
Come
to
bed
,
purity
!
<EOS>
said
she
.
<EOS>
You
are
a
nonsuch
,
I
suppose
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
said
I
,
I
ca
n't
come
to
bed
;
and
it
will
do
you
no
harm
to
let
me
stay
all
night
in
the
great
chair
.
 
<EOS>
Nan
,
said
she
,
undress
my
young
lady
.
 
<EOS>
If
she
wo
n't
let
you
,
I
'll
help
you
;
and
,
if
neither
of
us
can
do
it
quietly
,
we
'll
call
my
master
to
do
it
for
us
;
though
,
said
she
<EOS>
,
I
think
it
an
office
worthier
of
Monsieur
Colbrand
!
 
<EOS>
You
are
very
wicked
,
said
<EOS>
I.
 
I
know
it
,
said
she
;
<EOS>
I
am
a
Jezebel
,
and
a
London
prostitute
,
you
know
.
 
<EOS>
You
did
great
feats
,
said
I
,
to
tell
my
master
all
this
poor
stuff
;
but
you
did
not
tell
him
how
you
beat
me
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
lambkin
,
said
she
,
(
a
word
I
had
not
heard
a
good
while
,
)
that
I
left
for
you
to
tell
and
you
was
going
to
do
it
if
the
vulture
had
not
taken
the
wolf
's
part
,
and
bid
the
poor
innocent
lamb
be
silent
!
 
<EOS>
Ay
,
said
I
,
no
matter
for
your
fleers
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
;
though
I
can
have
neither
justice
nor
mercy
here
,
and
can
not
be
heard
in
my
defence
,
yet
a
time
will
come
,
may
be
,
when
I
shall
be
heard
,
and
when
your
own
guilt
will
strike
you
dumb
.
 
<EOS>
Ay
!
spirit
,
said
she
;
and
the
vulture
too
!
 
<EOS>
Must
we
both
be
dumb
?
 
<EOS>
Why
that
,
lambkin
,
will
be
pretty
!
 
<EOS>
Then
,
said
the
wicked
one
<EOS>
,
you
'll
have
all
the
talk
to
yourself
!
 
<EOS>
Then
how
will
the
tongue
of
the
pretty
lambkin
bleat
out
innocence
,
and
virtue
,
and
honesty
,
till
the
whole
trial
be
at
an
end
!
 
<EOS>
You
're
a
wicked
woman
<EOS>
,
that
's
certain
,
said
I
;
and
if
you
thought
any
thing
of
another
world
,
could
not
talk
thus
.
 
<EOS>
But
no
wonder
!
 
<EOS>
It
shews
what
hands
I
'm
got
into
!
 
<EOS>
Ay
,
so
it
does
,
said
she
;
but
I
beg
you
'll
undress
,
and
come
to
bed
,
or
I
believe
your
innocence
wo
n't
keep
you
from
still
worse
hands
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
come
to
bed
,
said
I
,
if
you
will
let
me
have
the
keys
in
my
own
hand
;
not
else
,
if
I
can
help
it
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
said
she
,
and
<EOS>
then
,
hey
for
another
contrivance
,
another
escape
!
  
<EOS>
No
,
no
,
said
I
,
<EOS>
all
my
contrivances
are
over
,
I
'll
assure
you
!
 
<EOS>
Pray
let
me
have
the
keys
,
and
I
will
come
to
bed
.
 
<EOS>
She
came
to
me
,
and
took
me
in
her
huge
arms
,
as
if
I
was
a
feather
:
<EOS>
Said
she
,
I
do
this
to
shew
you
what
a
poor
resistance
<EOS>
you
can
make
against
me
,
if
I
please
to
exert
myself
;
and
so
,
lambkin
,
do
n't
say
to
your
wolf
,
I
wo
n't
come
to
bed
!
  
<EOS>
And
set
me
down
,
and
tapped
me
on
the
neck
:
<EOS>
Ah
!
said
she
,
thou
art
a
pretty
creature
,
'
tis
true
;
but
so
obstinate
!
<EOS>
so
full
of
spirit
!
<EOS>
if
thy
strength
was
but
answerable
to
that
,
thou
would'st
run
away
with
us
all
,
and
this
great
house
too
on
thy
back
!
 
<EOS>
But
,
undress
,
undress
,
I
tell
you
.
  
<EOS>
Well
,
said
I
,
<EOS>
I
see
my
misfortunes
make
you
very
merry
,
and
very
witty
too
:
<EOS>
but
I
will
love
you
,
if
you
will
humour
me
with
the
keys
of
the
chamber
-
doors
.
 
<EOS>
Are
you
sure
you
will
love
me
?
<EOS>
said
she
:
Now
speak
your
conscience
!
 
<EOS>
Why
,
said
I
,
you
must
not
put
it
so
close
;
<EOS>
neither
would
you
,
if
you
thought
you
had
not
given
reason
to
doubt
it
!
 
<EOS>
But
I
will
love
you
as
well
as
I
can
!
 
<EOS>
I
would
not
tell
a
wilful
lie
:
and
if
I
did
,
you
would
not
believe
me
,
after
your
hard
usage
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
said
she
,
that
's
all
fair
,
I
own
!
 
<EOS>
But
Nan
,
pray
pull
off
my
young
lady
's
shoes
and
stockings
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
pray
do
n't
,
said
I
;
I
will
come
to
bed
presently
,
since
I
must
.
  
<EOS>
And
so
I
went
to
the
closet
,
and
scribbled
a
little
about
this
idle
chit
-
chat
.
<EOS>
And
she
being
importunate
,
I
was
forced
to
go
to
bed
;
but
with
some
of
my
clothes
on
,
as
the
former
night
;
and
she
let
me
hold
the
two
keys
;
for
there
are
two
locks
,
there
being
a
double
door
;
and
so
I
got
a
little
sleep
that
night
,
having
had
none
for
two
or
three
nights
before
.
  
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
imagine
what
she
means
;
but
Nan
offered
to
talk
a
little
once
or
twice
;
and
she
snubbed
her
,
and
said
,
I
charge
you
,
wench
,
do
n't
open
your
lips
before
me
;
and
if
you
are
asked
any
questions
by
Mrs.
Pamela
,
do
n't
answer
her
one
word
,
while
I
am
here
!
 
<EOS>
But
she
is
a
lordly
woman
to
the
maid
-
servants
;
and
that
has
always
been
her
character
:
<EOS>
O
how
unlike
good
Mrs.
Jervis
in
every
thing
.
  
<EOS>
Sunday
morning
.
  
<EOS>
A
thought
came
into
my
head
;
I
meant
no
harm
;
but
it
was
a
little
bold
.
<EOS>
For
,
seeing
my
master
dressing
to
go
to
church
;
and
his
chariot
getting
ready
,
I
went
to
my
closet
,
and
I
writ
,
      
<EOS>
The
prayers
of
this
congregation
are
earnestly
desired
for
a
    
gentleman
of
great
worth
and
honour
,
who
labours
under
a
temptation
    
to
exert
his
great
power
to
ruin
a
poor
,
distressed
,
worthless
    
maiden
:
      
<EOS>
And
also
,
      
The
prayers
of
this
congregation
are
earnestly
desired
by
a
poor
    
distressed
creature
,
for
the
preservation
of
her
virtue
and
    
innocence
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
came
up
:
Always
writing
!
<EOS>
said
she
;
and
would
see
it
:
<EOS>
And
strait
,
<EOS>
all
that
ever
I
could
say
,
carried
it
down
to
my
master
.
 
<EOS>
He
looked
upon
it
,
and
said
,
Tell
her
,
she
shall
soon
see
how
her
prayers
are
answered
;
she
is
very
bold
:
<EOS>
but
as
she
has
rejected
all
my
favours
,
her
reckoning
for
all
is
not
far
off
.
 
<EOS>
I
looked
after
him
out
of
the
window
;
and
he
was
charmingly
dressed
:
<EOS>
To
be
sure
he
is
a
handsome
fine
gentleman
!
 
<EOS>
What
pity
his
heart
is
not
as
good
as
his
appearance
!
 
<EOS>
Why
ca
n't
I
hate
him
?
 
<EOS>
But
do
n't
be
uneasy
,
if
you
should
see
this
;
for
it
is
impossible
I
should
love
him
;
for
his
vices
all
ugly
him
over
,
as
I
may
say
.
  
<EOS>
My
master
sends
word
,
that
he
shall
not
come
home
to
dinner
:
I
suppose
he
dines
with
this
Sir
Simon
Darnford
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
much
concerned
for
poor
Mr.
Williams
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
says
,
he
is
confined
still
,
and
takes
on
much
.
<EOS>
All
his
trouble
is
brought
upon
him
for
my
sake
:
This
grieves
me
much
.
<EOS>
My
master
,
it
seems
,
will
have
his
money
from
him
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
very
hard
;
for
it
is
three
fifty
pounds
,
he
gave
him
,
as
he
thought
,
as
a
salary
for
three
years
that
he
has
been
with
him
:
but
there
was
no
agreement
between
them
;
and
he
absolutely
depended
on
my
master
's
favour
.
 
<EOS>
To
be
sure
,
it
was
the
more
generous
of
him
to
run
these
risks
for
the
sake
of
oppressed
innocence
:
and
I
hope
he
will
meet
with
his
reward
in
due
time
.
 
<EOS>
Alas
for
me
!
 
<EOS>
I
dare
not
plead
for
him
;
that
would
raise
my
oppressor
's
jealousy
more
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
have
not
interest
to
save
myself
!
  
<EOS>
Sunday
evening
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
has
received
a
line
from
my
master
:
I
wonder
what
it
is
,
for
his
chariot
is
come
home
without
him
.
 
<EOS>
But
she
will
tell
me
nothing
;
<EOS>
so
it
is
in
vain
to
ask
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
so
fearful
of
plots
and
tricks
,
I
know
not
what
to
do
!
 
<EOS>
Every
thing
I
suspect
;
for
,
now
my
disgrace
is
avowed
,
what
can
I
think
!
 
<EOS>
To
be
sure
,
the
worst
will
be
attempted
!
 
<EOS>
I
can
only
pour
out
my
soul
in
prayer
to
God
,
for
his
blessed
protection
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
if
I
must
suffer
,
let
me
not
be
long
a
mournful
survivor
!
 
<EOS>
Only
let
me
not
shorten
my
own
time
sinfully
!
<EOS>

<EOS>
This
woman
left
upon
the
table
,
in
the
chamber
,
this
letter
of
my
master
's
to
her
;
and
I
bolted
myself
in
,
till
I
had
transcribed
it
.
<EOS>
You
'll
see
how
tremblingly
,
by
the
lines
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
poor
Mr.
Williams
's
release
at
any
rate
;
but
this
letter
makes
my
heart
ache
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
I
have
another
day
's
reprieve
,
thank
God
!

"
MRS

JEWKES

"
I
have
been
so
pressed
on
Williams
's
affair
,
that
I
shall
set
out
this
afternoon
,
in
Sir
Simon
's
chariot
,
and
with
Parson
Peters
,
who
is
his
intercessor
,
for
Stamford
;
and
shall
not
be
back
till
to
-
morrow
evening
,
if
then
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
your
ward
,
I
am
thoroughly
incensed
against
her
:
She
has
withstood
her
time
;
and
now
,
would
she
sign
and
seal
to
my
articles
,
it
is
too
late
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
discover
something
,
perhaps
,
by
him
;
and
will
,
on
my
return
,
let
her
know
,
that
all
her
ensnaring
loveliness
shall
not
save
her
from
the
fate
that
awaits
her
.
 
<EOS>
But
let
her
know
nothing
of
this
,
lest
it
put
her
fruitful
mind
upon
plots
and
artifices
.
 
<EOS>
Be
sure
trust
her
not
without
another
with
you
at
night
,
lest
she
venture
the
window
in
her
foolish
rashness
:
for
I
shall
require
her
at
your
hands
.

Yours

<EOS>
I
had
but
just
finished
taking
a
copy
of
this
,
and
laid
the
letter
where
I
had
it
,
and
unbolted
the
door
,
when
she
came
up
in
a
great
fright
,
for
fear
<EOS>
I
should
have
seen
it
;
but
I
being
in
my
closet
,
and
that
lying
as
she
left
it
,
she
did
not
mistrust
.
 
<EOS>
O
,
said
she
,
<EOS>
I
was
afraid
you
had
seen
my
master
's
letter
here
,
which
I
carelessly
left
on
the
table
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
,
said
I
,
I
had
known
that
.
 
<EOS>
Why
sure
,
said
she
,
if
you
had
,
you
would
not
have
offered
to
read
my
letters
!
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
said
I
,
<EOS>
I
should
,
at
this
time
,
if
it
had
been
in
my
way
:
 
Do
let
me
see
it
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
said
she
<EOS>
,
I
wish
poor
Mr.
Williams
well
off
<EOS>
:
I
understand
my
master
is
gone
to
make
up
matters
with
him
;
which
is
very
good
.
 
<EOS>
To
be
sure
,
added
she
,
he
is
a
very
good
gentleman
,
and
very
forgiving
!
 
<EOS>
Why
,
said
I
,
as
if
I
had
known
nothing
of
the
matter
,
how
can
he
make
up
matters
with
him
?
 
<EOS>
Is
not
Mr.
Williams
at
Stamford
?
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
said
she
,
I
believe
so
;
but
Parson
Peters
pleads
for
him
,
and
he
is
gone
with
him
to
Stamford
,
and
will
not
be
back
to
-
night
:
so
we
have
nothing
to
do
,
but
to
eat
our
suppers
betimes
,
and
go
to
bed
.
 
<EOS>
Ay
,
that
's
pure
,
said
I
;
and
I
shall
have
good
rest
this
night
,
I
hope
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
said
she
,
you
might
every
night
,
but
for
your
own
idle
fears
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
afraid
of
your
friends
,
when
none
are
near
you
.
 
<EOS>
Ay
,
that
's
true
,
said
I
;
for
I
have
not
one
near
me
.
  
<EOS>
So
I
have
one
more
good
honest
night
before
me
:
<EOS>
What
the
next
may
be
I
know
not
,
and
so
I
'll
try
to
take
in
a
good
deal
of
sleep
,
while
I
can
be
a
little
easy
.
 
<EOS>
Therefore
,
here
I
say
,
Good
night
,
my
dear
parents
;
for
I
have
no
more
to
write
about
this
night
:
and
though
his
letter
shocks
me
,
yet
I
will
be
as
brisk
as
I
can
,
that
she
may
n't
suspect
I
have
seen
it
.
  
<EOS>
Tuesday
night
.
  
<EOS>
For
the
future
,
I
will
always
mistrust
most
when
appearances
look
fairest
.
 
<EOS>
O
your
poor
daughter
!
<EOS>
what
has
she
not
suffered
since
what
I
wrote
on
Sunday
night
!
 
<EOS>
My
worst
trial
,
and
my
fearfullest
danger
!
 
<EOS>
O
how
I
shudder
to
write
you
an
account
of
this
wicked
interval
of
time
!
 
<EOS>
For
,
my
dear
parents
,
will
you
not
be
too
much
frightened
and
affected
with
my
distress
,
when
I
tell
you
,
that
his
journey
to
Stamford
was
all
abominable
pretence
!
<EOS>
for
he
came
home
privately
,
and
had
well
nigh
effected
all
his
vile
purposes
,
and
the
ruin
of
your
poor
daughter
!
<EOS>
and
that
by
such
a
plot
as
I
was
not
in
the
least
apprehensive
of
:
<EOS>
And
,
oh
!
<EOS>
you
'll
hear
what
a
vile
and
unwomanly
part
that
wicked
wretch
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
acted
in
it
!
  
<EOS>
I
left
off
with
letting
you
know
how
much
I
was
pleased
that
I
had
<EOS>
one
night
's
reprieve
added
to
my
honesty
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
had
less
occasion
to
rejoice
than
ever
,
as
you
will
judge
by
what
I
have
said
already
.
 
<EOS>
Take
,
then
,
<EOS>
the
dreadful
story
,
as
well
as
I
can
relate
it
.
  
<EOS>
The
maid
Nan
is
a
little
apt
to
drink
,
if
she
can
get
at
liquor
;
and
Mrs.
Jewkes
happened
,
or
designed
,
as
is
too
probable
,
to
leave
a
bottle
of
cherry
-
brandy
in
her
way
,
and
the
wench
drank
some
of
it
more
than
she
should
;
and
when
she
came
in
to
lay
the
cloth
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
perceived
it
,
and
fell
a
rating
at
her
most
sadly
;
for
she
has
too
many
faults
of
her
own
,
to
suffer
any
of
the
like
sort
in
any
body
else
,
if
she
can
help
it
;
and
she
bid
her
get
out
of
her
sight
,
when
we
had
supped
,
and
go
to
bed
,
to
sleep
off
her
liquor
,
before
we
came
to
bed
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
the
poor
maid
went
muttering
up
stairs
.
  
<EOS>
About
two
hours
after
,
which
was
near
eleven
o'clock
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
and
I
went
up
to
go
to
bed
;
I
pleasing
myself
with
what
a
charming
night
I
should
have
.
 
<EOS>
We
locked
both
doors
,
and
saw
poor
Nan
,
as
I
thought
,
(
<EOS>
but
,
oh
!
'
twas
my
abominable
master
,
as
you
shall
hear
by
and
by
,
)
sitting
fast
asleep
,
in
an
elbow
-
chair
,
in
a
dark
corner
of
the
room
,
with
her
apron
thrown
over
her
head
and
neck
.
 
<EOS>
And
Mrs.
Jewkes
said
,
There
is
that
beast
of
a
wench
fast
asleep
,
instead
of
being
a
-
bed
!
 
<EOS>
I
knew
,
said
she
,
she
had
taken
a
fine
dose
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
wake
her
,
said
I.
 
No
,
<EOS>
do
n't
,
said
she
;
let
her
sleep
on
;
we
shall
he
better
without
her
.
 
<EOS>
Ay
,
said
I
,
so
we
shall
;
but
wo
n't
she
get
cold
?
  
<EOS>
Said
she
<EOS>
,
I
hope
you
have
no
writing
to
-
night
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
replied
I
,
I
will
go
to
bed
with
you
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
.
 
<EOS>
Said
she
<EOS>
,
I
wonder
what
you
can
find
to
write
about
so
much
!
<EOS>
and
am
sure
you
have
better
conveniences
of
that
kind
,
and
more
paper
than
I
am
aware
of
;
and
I
had
intended
to
rummage
you
,
if
my
master
had
not
come
down
;
for
I
spied
a
broken
tea
-
cup
with
ink
,
which
gave
me
suspicion
:
but
as
he
is
come
,
let
him
look
after
you
,
if
he
will
;
and
if
you
deceive
him
,
it
will
be
his
own
fault
.
  
<EOS>
All
this
time
we
were
undressing
ourselves
:
<EOS>
And
I
fetched
a
deep
sigh
!
<EOS>
What
do
you
sigh
for
?
<EOS>
said
she
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
thinking
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
answered
I
,
what
a
sad
life
I
live
,
and
<EOS>
how
hard
is
my
lot
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
sure
,
the
thief
that
has
robbed
is
much
better
off
than
I
,
"
bating
the
guilt
;
and
I
should
,
I
think
,
take
it
for
a
mercy
,
to
be
hanged
out
of
the
way
,
rather
than
live
in
these
cruel
apprehensions
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
being
not
sleepy
,
and
in
a
prattling
vein
,
I
began
to
give
a
little
history
of
myself
,
as
I
did
,
once
before
,
to
Mrs.
Jervis
;
in
this
manner
:
  
Here
,
said
I
,
were
my
poor
honest
parents
;
they
took
care
to
instill
good
principles
into
my
mind
,
till
I
was
almost
twelve
years
of
age
;
and
taught
me
to
prefer
goodness
and
poverty
to
the
highest
condition
of
life
;
and
they
confirmed
their
lessons
by
their
own
practice
;
for
they
were
,
of
late
years
,
remarkably
poor
,
and
always
as
remarkably
honest
,
even
to
a
proverb
:
for
,
As
honest
as
goodman
ANDREWS
,
was
a
byeword
.
  
<EOS>
Well
then
,
said
I
,
comes
my
late
dear
good
lady
,
and
takes
a
fancy
to
me
,
and
said
,
she
would
be
the
making
of
me
,
if
I
was
a
good
girl
;
and
she
put
me
to
sing
,
to
dance
,
to
play
on
the
spinnet
,
in
order
to
divert
her
melancholy
hours
;
and
also
taught
me
all
manner
of
fine
needle
-
work
;
but
still
this
was
her
lesson
,
My
good
Pamela
,
be
virtuous
,
and
keep
the
men
at
a
distance
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
so
I
was
,
I
hope
,
and
so
I
did
;
and
yet
,
though
I
say
it
,
they
all
loved
me
and
respected
me
;
and
would
do
any
thing
for
me
,
as
if
I
was
a
gentlewoman
.
  
<EOS>
But
,
then
,
what
comes
next
?
 
<EOS>
Why
,
it
pleased
God
to
take
my
good
lady
:
and
then
comes
my
master
:
<EOS>
And
what
says
he
?
 
<EOS>
Why
,
in
effect
,
it
is
,
Be
not
virtuous
,
Pamela
.
  
<EOS>
So
here
I
have
lived
about
sixteen
years
in
virtue
and
reputation
;
and
all
at
once
,
when
I
come
to
know
what
is
good
,
and
what
is
evil
,
I
must
renounce
all
the
good
,
all
the
whole
sixteen
years
'
innocence
,
which
,
next
to
God
's
grace
,
I
owed
chiefly
to
my
parents
,
and
my
lady
's
good
lessons
and
examples
,
and
choose
the
evil
;
and
so
,
in
a
moment
's
time
,
become
the
vilest
of
creatures
!
 
<EOS>
And
all
this
,
for
what
,
I
pray
?
 
<EOS>
Why
,
truly
,
for
a
pair
of
diamond
ear
-
rings
,
a
necklace
,
and
a
diamond
ring
for
my
finger
;
which
would
not
become
me
:
For
a
few
paltry
fine
clothes
,
which
,
when
I
wore
them
,
would
make
but
my
former
poverty
more
ridiculous
to
every
body
that
saw
me
;
especially
when
they
knew
the
base
terms
I
wore
them
upon
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
indeed
,
I
was
to
have
a
great
parcel
of
guineas
beside
;
I
forget
how
many
;
for
,
had
there
been
ten
times
more
<EOS>
,
they
would
have
been
not
so
much
to
me
,
as
the
honest
six
guineas
you
tricked
me
out
of
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
.
  
<EOS>
Well
,
forsooth
!
<EOS>
but
then
I
was
to
have
<EOS>
I
know
not
how
many
pounds
a
year
for
my
life
;
and
my
poor
father
<EOS>
(
there
was
the
jest
of
it
!
)
<EOS>
was
to
be
the
manager
for
the
abandoned
prostitute
his
daughter
:
<EOS>
And
then
,
(
there
was
the
jest
again
!
)
<EOS>
my
kind
,
forgiving
,
virtuous
master
,
would
pardon
me
all
my
misdeeds
!
  
<EOS>
Yes
,
thank
him
for
nothing
,
truly
.
 
<EOS>
And
what
,
pray
,
are
all
these
violent
misdeeds
?
 
<EOS>
Why
,
they
are
for
daring
to
adhere
to
the
good
lessons
that
were
taught
me
;
and
not
learning
a
new
one
,
that
would
have
reversed
all
my
former
:
For
not
being
contented
when
I
was
run
away
with
,
in
order
to
be
ruined
;
but
contriving
,
if
my
poor
wits
had
been
able
,
to
get
out
of
danger
,
and
preserve
myself
honest
.
  
<EOS>
Then
was
he
once
jealous
of
poor
John
,
though
he
knew
John
was
his
own
creature
,
and
helped
to
deceive
me
.
  
<EOS>
Then
was
he
outrageous
against
poor
Parson
Williams
!
<EOS>
and
him
has
this
good
,
merciful
master
,
thrown
into
gaol
;
and
for
what
?
 
<EOS>
Why
,
truly
,
for
that
,
being
a
divine
,
and
a
good
man
,
he
had
the
fear
of
God
before
his
eyes
,
and
was
willing
to
forego
all
his
expectations
of
interest
,
and
assist
an
oppressed
poor
creature
.
  
<EOS>
But
,
to
be
sure
,
I
must
be
forward
,
bold
,
saucy
,
and
what
<EOS>
not
!
<EOS>
to
dare
to
run
away
from
certain
ruin
,
and
to
strive
to
escape
from
an
unjust
confinement
;
and
I
must
be
married
to
the
parson
,
nothing
so
sure
!
  
<EOS>
He
would
have
had
but
a
poor
catch
of
me
,
had
I
consented
:
<EOS>
But
he
,
and
you
too
,
know
I
did
not
want
to
marry
any
body
.
 
<EOS>
I
only
wanted
to
go
to
my
poor
parents
,
and
to
have
my
own
liberty
,
and
not
to
be
confined
by
such
an
unlawful
restraint
;
and
which
would
not
have
been
inflicted
upon
me
,
but
only
that
I
am
a
poor
,
destitute
,
young
body
,
and
have
no
friend
that
is
able
to
right
me
.
  
<EOS>
So
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
said
I
,
here
is
my
history
in
brief
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
am
a
very
unhappy
young
creature
,
to
be
sure
!
 
<EOS>
And
why
am
I
so
?
 
<EOS>
Why
,
because
my
master
sees
something
in
my
person
that
takes
his
present
fancy
;
and
because
I
would
not
be
undone
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
therefore
to
choose
,
I
must
,
and
I
shall
be
undone
!
 
<EOS>
And
this
is
all
the
reason
that
can
be
given
!
  
<EOS>
She
heard
me
run
on
all
this
time
,
while
I
was
undressing
,
without
any
interruption
;
and
I
said
,
Well
,
I
must
go
to
the
two
closets
,
ever
since
an
affair
of
the
closet
at
the
other
house
,
though
he
is
so
far
off
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
have
a
good
mind
to
wake
this
poor
maid
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
do
n't
,
said
she
,
I
charge
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
very
angry
with
her
,
and
she
'll
get
no
harm
there
;
and
if
she
wakes
,
she
may
come
to
bed
well
enough
,
as
long
as
there
is
a
candle
in
the
chimney
.
  
<EOS>
So
I
looked
into
the
closet
,
and
kneeled
down
in
my
own
,
as
I
used
to
do
,
to
say
my
prayers
,
and
this
with
my
underclothes
in
my
hand
,
all
undressed
;
and
passed
by
the
poor
sleeping
wench
,
as
I
thought
,
in
my
return
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
oh
!
<EOS>
little
<EOS>
did
I
think
it
was
my
wicked
,
wicked
master
,
in
a
gown
and
petticoat
of
hers
,
and
her
apron
over
his
face
and
shoulders
.
<EOS>
What
meanness
will
not
Lucifer
make
his
votaries
stoop
to
,
to
gain
their
abominable
ends
!
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
by
this
time
,
was
got
to
bed
,
on
the
farther
side
,
as
she
used
to
be
;
and
,
to
make
room
for
the
maid
,
when
she
should
awake
,
I
got
into
bed
,
and
lay
close
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
said
,
Where
are
the
keys
?
<EOS>
though
,
said
I
,
I
am
not
so
much
afraid
to
-
night
.
 
<EOS>
Here
,
said
the
wicked
woman
,
put
your
arm
under
mine
,
and
you
shall
find
them
about
my
wrist
,
as
they
used
to
be
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
did
,
and
the
abominable
designer
held
my
hand
with
her
right
-
hand
,
as
my
right
-
arm
was
under
her
left
.
  
<EOS>
In
less
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
I
said
,
There
's
poor
Nan
awake
;
I
hear
her
stir
.
 
<EOS>
Let
us
go
to
sleep
,
said
she
,
and
not
mind
her
:
she
'll
come
to
bed
,
when
she
's
quite
awake
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
soul
!
<EOS>
said
I
,
I
'll
warrant
she
will
have
the
head
-
ache
finely
to
-
morrow
for
this
!
 
<EOS>
Be
silent
,
said
she
,
and
go
to
sleep
;
you
keep
me
awake
;
and
I
never
found
you
in
so
talkative
a
humour
in
my
life
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
chide
me
,
said
I
;
<EOS>
I
will
but
say
one
thing
more
:
Do
you
think
Nan
could
hear
me
talk
of
my
master
's
offers
?
 
<EOS>
No
,
no
,
said
she
;
she
was
dead
asleep
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
glad
of
that
,
said
I
;
because
I
would
not
expose
my
master
to
his
common
servants
;
and
I
knew
you
were
no
stranger
to
his
fine
articles
.
 
<EOS>
Said
she
<EOS>
,
I
think
they
were
fine
articles
,
and
you
were
bewitched
you
did
not
close
with
them
:
But
let
us
go
to
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
was
silent
;
and
the
pretended
Nan
(
O
wicked
,
base
,
villanous
designer
!
<EOS>
what
a
plot
,
what
an
unexpected
plot
was
this
!
)
seemed
to
be
awaking
;
and
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
abhorrent
creature
!
<EOS>
said
,
Come
,
Nan
!
 
<EOS>
what
,
are
you
awake
at
last
?
 
<EOS>
Pr'ythee
come
to
bed
;
for
Mrs.
Pamela
is
in
a
talking
fit
,
and
wo
n't
go
to
sleep
one
while
.
  
<EOS>
At
that
,
the
pretended
<EOS>
she
came
to
the
bed
side
;
and
,
sitting
down
in
a
chair
,
where
the
curtain
hid
her
,
began
to
undress
.
 
<EOS>
Said
I
,
Poor
Mrs.
Anne
<EOS>
,
I
warrant
your
head
aches
most
sadly
!
 
<EOS>
How
do
you
do
?
  
<EOS>
Says
he
,
One
word
with
you
,
Pamela
;
one
word
hear
me
<EOS>
but
;
I
must
say
one
word
to
you
<EOS>
,
it
is
this
:
<EOS>
You
see
now
you
are
in
my
power
!
 
<EOS>
You
can
not
get
from
me
,
nor
help
yourself
:
<EOS>
Yet
have
I
not
offered
any
thing
amiss
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
But
if
you
resolve
not
to
comply
with
my
proposals
,
I
will
not
lose
this
opportunity
:
If
you
do
,
I
will
yet
leave
you
.
  
<EOS>
O
sir
,
said
I
,
leave
me
,
leave
me
<EOS>
but
,
and
I
will
do
any
thing
I
ought
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
Swear
then
to
me
<EOS>
,
said
he
,
that
you
will
accept
my
proposals
!
 
<EOS>
With
struggling
,
fright
,
terror
,
I
fainted
away
quite
,
and
did
not
come
to
myself
soon
,
so
that
they
both
,
from
the
cold
sweats
that
I
was
in
,
thought
me
dying
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
remember
no
more
,
than
that
,
when
with
great
difficulty
they
brought
me
to
myself
<EOS>
,
she
was
sitting
on
one
side
of
the
bed
,
with
her
clothes
on
;
and
he
on
the
other
with
his
,
and
in
his
gown
and
slippers
.
  
<EOS>
Your
poor
Pamela
can
not
answer
for
the
liberties
taken
with
her
in
her
deplorable
state
of
death
.
 
<EOS>
And
when
I
saw
them
there
,
I
sat
up
in
my
bed
,
without
any
regard
to
what
appearance
I
made
,
and
nothing
about
my
neck
;
and
he
soothing
me
,
with
an
aspect
of
pity
and
concern
,
I
put
my
hand
to
his
mouth
,
and
said
,
O
tell
me
,
yet
tell
me
not
,
what
have
I
suffered
in
this
distress
?
 
<EOS>
And
I
talked
quite
wild
,
and
knew
not
what
:
for
,
to
be
sure
<EOS>
,
I
was
on
the
point
of
distraction
.
  
<EOS>
He
most
solemnly
,
and
with
a
bitter
imprecation
,
vowed
,
that
he
had
not
offered
the
least
indecency
;
that
he
was
frightened
at
the
terrible
manner
I
was
taken
with
the
fit
:
that
he
should
desist
from
his
attempt
;
and
begged
but
to
see
me
easy
and
quiet
,
and
he
would
leave
me
directly
,
and
go
to
his
own
bed
.
 
<EOS>
O
then
,
said
I
,
take
with
you
this
most
wicked
woman
,
this
vile
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
as
an
earnest
,
that
I
may
believe
you
!
  
<EOS>
And
will
you
,
sir
,
said
the
wicked
wretch
,
for
a
fit
or
two
,
give
up
such
an
opportunity
as
this
?
 
<EOS>
I
thought
you
had
known
the
sex
better
.
 
<EOS>
She
is
now
,
you
see
,
quite
well
again
!
  
<EOS>
This
I
heard
<EOS>
;
more
she
might
say
;
but
I
fainted
away
once
more
,
at
these
words
,
and
at
his
clasping
his
arms
about
me
again
.
 
<EOS>
And
,
when
I
came
a
little
to
myself
,
I
saw
him
sit
there
,
and
the
maid
Nan
,
holding
a
smelling
-
bottle
to
my
nose
,
and
no
Mrs.
Jewkes
.
  
<EOS>
He
said
,
taking
my
hand
<EOS>
,
Now
will
I
vow
to
you
,
my
dear
Pamela
,
that
I
will
leave
you
the
moment
I
see
you
better
,
and
pacified
.
 
<EOS>
Here
's
Nan
knows
,
and
will
tell
you
,
my
concern
for
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
vow
to
God
<EOS>
,
I
have
not
offered
any
indecency
to
you
:
and
,
since
I
found
Mrs.
Jewkes
so
offensive
to
you
,
I
have
sent
her
to
the
maid
's
bed
,
and
the
maid
shall
be
with
you
to
-
night
.
 
<EOS>
And
but
promise
me
,
that
you
will
compose
yourself
,
and
I
will
leave
you
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
said
I
,
will
not
Nan
also
hold
my
hand
?
 
<EOS>
And
will
not
she
let
you
come
in
again
to
me
?
 
<EOS>
He
said
,
By
heaven
!
 
<EOS>
I
will
not
come
in
again
to
-
night
.
 
<EOS>
Nan
,
undress
yourself
,
go
to
bed
,
and
do
all
you
can
to
comfort
the
dear
creature
:
<EOS>
And
now
,
Pamela
,
said
he
,
give
me
but
your
hand
,
and
say
you
forgive
me
,
and
I
will
leave
you
to
your
repose
.
 
<EOS>
I
held
out
my
trembling
hand
,
which
he
vouchsafed
to
kiss
;
and
<EOS>
I
said
,
God
forgive
you
,
sir
,
as
you
have
been
just
in
my
distress
;
and
as
you
will
be
just
to
what
you
promise
!
 
<EOS>
And
he
withdrew
,
with
a
countenance
of
remorse
,
as
I
hoped
;
and
she
shut
the
doors
,
and
,
at
my
request
,
brought
the
keys
to
bed
.
  
<EOS>
This
,
O
my
dear
parents
!
<EOS>
was
a
most
dreadful
trial
.
 
<EOS>
I
tremble
still
to
think
of
it
;
and
dare
not
recall
all
the
horrid
circumstances
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
,
as
he
assures
me
,
he
was
not
guilty
of
indecency
;
but
have
reason
to
bless
God
,
who
,
by
disabling
me
in
my
faculties
,
empowered
me
to
preserve
my
innocence
;
and
,
when
all
my
strength
would
have
signified
nothing
,
magnified
himself
in
my
weakness
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
so
weak
all
day
on
Monday
,
that
I
could
not
get
out
of
my
bed
.
 
<EOS>
My
master
shewed
great
tenderness
for
me
;
and
I
hope
he
is
really
sorry
,
and
that
this
will
be
his
last
attempt
;
but
he
does
not
say
so
neither
.
  
<EOS>
He
came
in
the
morning
,
as
soon
as
he
heard
the
door
open
and
I
began
to
be
fearful
.
 
<EOS>
He
stopped
short
of
the
bed
,
and
said
,
Rather
than
give
you
apprehensions
,
I
will
come
no
farther
.
 
<EOS>
I
said
,
Your
honour
,
sir
,
and
your
mercy
,
is
all
I
have
to
beg
.
 
<EOS>
He
sat
himself
on
the
side
of
the
bed
,
and
asked
kindly
,
how
I
did
?
 
<EOS>
begged
me
to
be
composed
;
said
,
I
still
looked
a
little
wildly
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
said
,
Pray
,
good
sir
,
let
me
not
see
this
infamous
Mrs.
Jewkes
;
I
doubt
I
can
not
bear
her
sight
.
 
<EOS>
She
sha
n't
come
near
you
all
this
day
,
if
you
'll
promise
to
compose
yourself
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
sir
,
I
will
try
.
 
<EOS>
He
pressed
my
hand
very
tenderly
,
and
went
out
.
 
<EOS>
What
a
change
does
this
shew
!
 
<EOS>
O
may
it
be
lasting
!
 
<EOS>
But
,
alas
!
<EOS>
he
seems
only
to
have
altered
his
method
of
proceeding
;
and
retains
,
I
doubt
,
his
wicked
purpose
.
  
<EOS>
On
Tuesday
,
about
ten
o'clock
,
when
my
master
heard
I
was
up
,
he
sent
for
me
down
into
the
parlour
.
 
<EOS>
As
soon
as
he
saw
me
,
he
said
,
Come
nearer
to
me
,
Pamela
.
 
<EOS>
I
did
so
,
and
he
took
my
hand
,
and
said
,
You
begin
to
look
well
again
:
I
am
glad
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
You
little
slut
,
how
did
you
frighten
me
on
Sunday
night
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
,
said
I
,
pray
name
not
that
night
;
and
my
eyes
overflowed
at
the
remembrance
,
and
I
turned
my
head
aside
.
  
<EOS>
Said
he
,
Place
some
little
confidence
in
me
:
<EOS>
I
know
what
those
charming
eyes
mean
,
and
you
shall
not
need
to
explain
yourself
:
for
I
do
assure
you
,
that
as
soon
as
I
saw
you
change
,
and
a
cold
sweat
bedew
<EOS>
your
pretty
face
,
and
you
fainted
away
<EOS>
,
I
quitted
the
bed
,
and
Mrs.
Jewkes
did
so
too
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
put
on
my
gown
,
and
she
fetched
her
smelling
-
bottle
,
and
we
both
did
all
we
could
to
restore
you
;
and
my
passion
for
you
was
all
swallowed
up
in
the
concern
I
had
for
your
recovery
;
for
I
thought
I
never
saw
a
fit
so
strong
and
violent
in
my
life
:
and
feared
we
should
not
bring
you
to
life
again
;
for
what
I
saw
you
in
once
before
was
nothing
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
This
,
said
he
,
might
be
my
folly
,
and
my
unacquaintedness
with
what
passion
<EOS>
your
sex
can
shew
when
they
are
in
earnest
.
 
<EOS>
But
this
I
repeat
to
you
,
that
your
mind
may
be
entirely
comforted
 
Whatever
I
offered
to
you
<EOS>
,
was
before
you
fainted
away
,
and
that
,
I
am
sure
,
was
innocent
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
,
said
I
,
that
was
very
bad
:
and
it
was
too
plain
you
had
the
worst
designs
.
 
<EOS>
When
,
said
he
,
I
tell
you
the
truth
in
one
instance
,
you
may
believe
me
in
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
not
<EOS>
,
I
declare
,
beyond
this
lovely
bosom
,
your
sex
:
but
that
I
did
intend
what
you
call
the
worst
<EOS>
is
most
certain
:
and
though
I
would
not
too
much
alarm
you
now
,
I
could
curse
my
weakness
,
and
my
folly
,
which
makes
me
own
,
that
I
love
you
beyond
all
your
sex
,
and
can
not
live
without
you
.
 
<EOS>
But
if
I
am
master
of
myself
,
and
my
own
resolution
,
I
will
not
attempt
to
force
you
to
any
thing
again
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
,
said
I
,
you
may
easily
keep
your
resolution
,
if
you
'll
send
me
out
of
your
way
,
to
my
poor
parents
;
that
is
all
I
beg
.
  
<EOS>
@@@Tis
a
folly
to
talk
of
it
,
said
he
.
 
<EOS>
You
must
not
,
shall
not
go
!
 
<EOS>
And
if
I
could
be
assured
you
would
not
attempt
it
,
you
should
have
better
usage
,
and
your
confinement
should
be
made
easier
to
you
.
  
<EOS>
But
to
what
end
,
sir
,
am
I
to
stay
?
<EOS>
said
I
:
<EOS>
You
yourself
seem
not
sure
you
can
keep
your
own
present
good
resolutions
;
and
do
you
think
,
if
I
was
to
stay
,
when
I
could
get
away
,
and
be
safe
,
it
would
not
look
,
as
if
either
I
confided
too
much
in
my
own
strength
,
or
would
tempt
my
ruin
?
<EOS>
And
as
if
I
was
not
in
earnest
to
wish
myself
safe
,
and
out
of
danger
?
  
<EOS>
And
then
,
how
long
am
I
to
stay
?
 
<EOS>
And
to
what
purpose
?
 
<EOS>
And
in
what
light
must
I
appear
to
the
world
?
 
<EOS>
Would
not
that
censure
me
,
although
I
might
be
innocent
?
 
<EOS>
And
you
will
allow
,
sir
,
that
,
if
there
be
any
thing
valuable
or
exemplary
in
a
good
name
,
or
fair
reputation
,
one
must
not
despise
the
world
's
censure
,
if
one
can
avoid
it
.
  
<EOS>
Well
,
said
he
,
I
sent
not
for
you
on
this
account
,
just
now
;
but
for
two
reasons
.
 
<EOS>
The
first
is
,
That
you
promise
me
,
that
for
a
fortnight
to
come
you
will
not
offer
to
go
away
without
my
express
consent
;
and
this
I
expect
for
your
own
sake
,
that
I
may
give
you
a
little
more
liberty
.
 
<EOS>
And
the
second
is
,
That
you
will
see
and
forgive
Mrs.
Jewkes
<EOS>
:
she
takes
on
much
,
and
thinks
that
,
as
all
her
fault
was
her
obedience
to
me
,
it
would
be
very
hard
to
sacrifice
her
,
as
she
calls
it
,
to
your
resentment
.
  
<EOS>
As
to
the
first
,
sir
,
said
I
,
it
is
a
hard
injunction
,
for
the
reasons
I
have
mentioned
.
 
<EOS>
And
as
to
the
second
,
considering
her
vile
,
unwomanly
wickedness
,
and
her
endeavours
to
instigate
you
more
to
ruin
me
,
when
your
returning
goodness
seemed
to
have
some
compassion
upon
me
,
it
is
still
harder
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
to
shew
my
obedience
to
your
commands
,
(
for
you
know
,
my
dear
parents
,
I
might
as
well
make
a
merit
of
my
compliance
,
when
my
refusal
would
stand
me
in
no
stead
,
)
I
will
consent
to
both
;
and
to
every
thing
else
,
that
you
shall
be
pleased
to
enjoin
,
which
I
can
do
,
with
innocence
.
  
<EOS>
That
's
my
good
girl
!
<EOS>
said
he
,
and
kissed
me
:
<EOS>
This
is
quite
prudent
,
and
shews
me
,
that
you
do
n't
take
insolent
advantage
of
my
favour
for
you
;
and
will
,
perhaps
,
stand
you
in
more
stead
than
you
are
aware
of
.
  
<EOS>
So
he
rung
the
bell
,
and
said
,
Call
down
Mrs.
Jewkes
.
 
<EOS>
She
came
down
,
and
he
took
my
hand
,
and
put
it
into
hers
;
and
said
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
I
am
obliged
to
you
for
all
your
diligence
and
fidelity
to
me
;
but
Pamela
,
I
must
own
,
is
not
;
because
the
service
I
employed
you
in
was
not
so
very
obliging
to
her
,
as
I
could
have
wished
she
would
have
thought
it
:
and
you
were
not
to
favour
her
,
but
obey
me
.
 
<EOS>
But
yet
I
'll
assure
you
,
at
the
very
first
word
,
she
has
once
obliged
me
,
by
consenting
to
be
friends
with
you
;
and
if
she
gives
me
no
great
cause
,
I
shall
not
,
perhaps
,
put
you
on
such
disagreeable
service
again
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
therefore
,
be
you
once
more
bed
-
fellows
and
board
-
fellows
,
as
I
may
say
,
for
some
days
longer
;
and
see
that
Pamela
sends
no
letters
nor
messages
out
of
the
house
,
nor
keeps
a
correspondence
unknown
to
me
,
especially
with
that
Williams
;
and
,
as
for
the
rest
,
shew
the
dear
girl
all
the
respect
that
is
due
to
one
I
must
love
,
if
she
will
deserve
it
,
as
I
hope
she
will
yet
;
and
let
her
be
under
no
unnecessary
or
harsh
restraints
.
 
<EOS>
But
your
watchful
care
is
not
,
however
,
to
cease
:
and
remember
that
you
are
not
to
disoblige
me
,
to
oblige
her
;
and
that
I
will
not
,
can
not
,
yet
part
with
her
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
looked
very
sullen
,
and
as
if
she
would
be
glad
still
to
do
me
a
good
turn
,
if
it
lay
in
her
power
.
  
<EOS>
I
took
courage
then
to
drop
a
word
or
two
for
poor
Mr.
Williams
;
but
he
was
angry
with
me
for
it
,
and
said
he
could
not
endure
to
hear
his
name
in
my
mouth
;
so
I
was
forced
to
have
done
for
that
time
.
  
<EOS>
All
this
time
,
my
papers
,
that
I
buried
under
the
rose
-
bush
,
lay
there
still
;
and
I
begged
for
leave
to
send
a
letter
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
should
,
he
said
,
if
he
might
read
it
first
.
 
<EOS>
But
this
did
not
answer
my
design
;
and
yet
I
would
have
sent
you
such
a
letter
as
he
might
see
,
if
I
had
been
sure
my
danger
was
over
.
 
<EOS>
But
that
I
can
not
;
for
he
now
seems
to
take
another
method
,
and
what
I
am
more
afraid
of
,
because
,
may
be
,
he
may
watch
an
opportunity
,
and
join
force
with
it
,
on
occasion
,
when
I
am
least
prepared
:
for
now
he
seems
to
abound
with
kindness
,
and
talks
of
love
without
reserve
,
and
makes
nothing
of
allowing
himself
in
the
liberty
of
kissing
me
,
which
he
calls
innocent
;
but
which
I
do
not
like
,
and
especially
in
the
manner
he
does
it
:
but
for
a
master
to
do
it
at
all
to
a
servant
,
has
meaning
too
much
in
it
,
not
to
alarm
an
honest
body
.
  
<EOS>
Wednesday
morning
.
  
<EOS>
I
find
I
am
watched
and
suspected
still
very
close
;
and
I
wish
I
was
with
you
;
but
that
must
not
be
,
it
seems
,
this
fortnight
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
like
this
fortnight
;
and
it
will
be
a
tedious
and
a
dangerous
one
to
me
,
<EOS>
I
doubt
.
  
<EOS>
My
master
just
now
sent
for
me
down
to
take
a
walk
with
him
in
the
garden
:
<EOS>
but
I
like
him
not
at
all
,
nor
his
ways
;
for
he
would
have
,
<EOS>
all
the
way
,
his
arm
about
my
waist
,
and
said
abundance
of
fond
things
to
me
,
enough
to
make
me
proud
,
if
his
design
had
not
been
apparent
.
 
<EOS>
After
walking
about
,
he
led
me
into
a
little
alcove
,
on
the
farther
part
of
the
garden
;
and
really
made
me
afraid
of
myself
,
for
he
began
to
be
very
teasing
,
and
made
me
sit
on
his
knee
;
and
was
so
often
kissing
me
,
that
I
said
,
Sir
,
I
do
n't
like
to
be
here
at
all
,
I
assure
you
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
you
make
me
afraid
!
 
<EOS>
And
what
made
me
the
more
so
<EOS>
,
was
what
he
once
said
to
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
and
did
not
think
I
heard
him
,
and
which
,
though
always
uppermost
with
me
,
I
did
not
mention
before
,
because
I
did
not
know
how
to
bring
it
in
,
in
my
writing
.
  
<EOS>
She
,
I
suppose
,
had
been
encouraging
him
in
his
wickedness
;
for
it
was
before
the
last
dreadful
trial
:
and
I
only
heard
what
he
answered
.
  
<EOS>
Said
he
,
I
will
try
once
more
;
but
I
have
begun
wrong
for
I
see
terror
does
but
add
to
her
frost
;
but
she
is
a
charming
girl
,
and
may
be
thawed
by
kindness
;
and
I
should
have
melted
her
by
love
,
instead
of
freezing
her
by
fear
.
  
<EOS>
Is
he
not
a
wicked
,
sad
man
for
this
?
 
<EOS>
To
be
sure
,
I
blush
while
I
write
it
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
trust
,
that
that
God
,
who
has
delivered
me
from
the
paw
of
the
lion
and
the
bear
;
that
is
,
his
and
Mrs.
Jewkes
's
violences
,
will
soon
deliver
me
from
this
Philistine
,
that
I
may
not
defy
the
commands
of
the
living
God
!
  
<EOS>
But
,
as
I
was
saying
,
this
expression
coming
into
my
thoughts
,
I
was
of
opinion
,
I
could
not
be
too
much
on
my
guard
,
at
all
times
:
more
especially
when
he
took
such
liberties
:
for
he
professed
honour
all
the
time
with
his
mouth
,
while
his
actions
did
not
correspond
.
 
<EOS>
I
begged
and
prayed
he
would
let
me
go
:
and
had
I
not
appeared
quite
regardless
of
all
he
said
,
and
resolved
not
to
stay
,
if
I
could
help
it
<EOS>
,
I
know
not
how
far
he
would
have
proceeded
;
for
I
was
forced
to
fall
down
upon
my
knees
.
  
<EOS>
At
last
he
walked
out
with
me
,
still
bragging
of
his
honour
and
his
love
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
yes
,
sir
,
said
I
,
your
honour
is
to
destroy
mine
:
and
your
love
is
to
ruin
me
;
I
see
it
too
plainly
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
indeed
,
I
will
not
talk
with
you
,
sir
,
said
I
,
any
more
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
know
,
said
he
,
whom
you
talk
to
,
and
where
you
are
?
  
<EOS>
You
may
believe
I
had
reason
to
think
him
not
so
decent
as
he
should
be
;
for
I
said
,
As
to
where
I
am
,
sir
,
I
know
it
too
well
;
and
that
I
have
no
creature
to
befriend
me
:
and
,
as
to
whom
I
talk
to
,
sir
,
let
me
ask
you
,
What
you
would
have
me
answer
?
  
<EOS>
Why
,
tell
me
,
said
he
,
what
answer
you
would
make
?
 
<EOS>
It
will
only
make
you
angry
,
said
I
;
and
so
I
shall
fare
worse
,
if
possible
.
 
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
be
angry
,
said
he
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
then
,
sir
,
said
I
,
you
can
not
be
my
late
good
lady
's
son
;
for
she
loved
me
,
and
taught
me
virtue
.
 
<EOS>
You
can
not
then
be
my
master
;
for
no
master
demeans
himself
so
to
his
poor
servant
.
  
<EOS>
He
put
his
arm
round
me
,
and
his
other
hand
on
my
neck
,
which
made
me
more
angry
and
bold
:
and
he
said
,
What
then
am
I
?
 
<EOS>
Why
,
said
I
,
(
struggling
from
him
,
and
in
a
great
passion
,
)
to
be
sure
you
are
Lucifer
himself
,
in
the
shape
of
my
master
,
or
you
could
not
use
me
thus
.
 
<EOS>
These
are
too
great
liberties
,
said
he
,
in
anger
;
and
I
desire
that
you
will
not
repeat
them
,
for
your
own
sake
:
<EOS>
For
if
you
have
no
decency
towards
me
,
I
'll
have
none
towards
you
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
running
from
him
,
and
he
said
,
Come
back
,
when
I
bid
you
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
knowing
every
place
was
alike
dangerous
to
me
,
and
I
had
nobody
to
run
to
<EOS>
,
I
came
back
,
at
his
call
;
and
seeing
him
look
displeased
,
I
held
my
hands
together
,
and
wept
,
and
said
,
Pray
,
sir
,
forgive
me
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
said
he
,
rather
say
,
Pray
,
Lucifer
,
forgive
me
!
 
<EOS>
And
,
now
,
since
you
take
me
for
the
devil
,
how
can
you
expect
any
good
from
me
?
 
<EOS>
How
,
rather
,
can
you
expect
any
thing
but
the
worst
treatment
from
me
?
 
<EOS>
You
have
given
me
a
character
,
Pamela
;
and
blame
me
not
that
I
act
up
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
said
I
,
let
me
beg
you
to
forgive
me
:
I
am
really
sorry
for
my
boldness
;
but
indeed
you
do
n't
use
me
like
a
gentleman
:
and
how
can
I
express
my
resentment
,
if
I
mince
the
matter
,
while
you
are
so
indecent
?
 
<EOS>
Precise
fool
!
<EOS>
said
he
,
what
indecencies
have
I
offered
you
?
 
<EOS>
I
was
bewitched
<EOS>
I
had
not
gone
through
my
purpose
last
Sunday
night
;
and
then
your
licentious
tongue
had
not
given
the
worst
name
to
little
puny
freedoms
,
<EOS>
that
shew
my
love
and
my
folly
at
the
same
time
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
begone
!
<EOS>
said
he
,
taking
my
hand
,
and
tossing
it
from
him
,
and
learn
another
conduct
and
more
wit
;
and
I
will
lay
aside
my
foolish
regard
for
you
,
and
assert
myself
.
 
<EOS>
Begone
!
<EOS>
said
he
,
again
,
with
a
haughty
air
.
  
<EOS>
Indeed
,
sir
,
said
I
,
I
can
not
go
,
till
you
pardon
me
,
which
I
beg
on
my
bended
knees
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
truly
sorry
for
my
boldness
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
see
how
you
go
on
:
you
creep
by
little
and
little
upon
me
;
and
now
soothe
me
,
and
now
threaten
me
;
and
if
I
should
forbear
to
shew
my
resentment
,
when
you
offer
incivilities
to
me
,
would
not
that
be
to
be
lost
by
degrees
?
 
<EOS>
Would
it
not
shew
,
that
I
could
bear
any
thing
from
you
,
if
I
did
not
express
all
the
indignation
I
could
express
,
at
the
first
approaches
you
make
to
what
I
dread
?
 
<EOS>
And
have
you
not
as
good
as
avowed
my
ruin
?
 
<EOS>
And
have
you
once
made
me
hope
you
will
quit
your
purposes
against
me
?
 
<EOS>
How
then
,
sir
,
can
I
act
,
but
by
shewing
my
abhorrence
of
every
step
that
makes
towards
my
undoing
?
 
<EOS>
And
what
is
left
me
but
<EOS>
words
?
 
<EOS>
And
can
these
words
be
other
than
such
strong
ones
,
<EOS>
as
shall
shew
the
detestation
which
,
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
,
I
have
for
every
attempt
upon
my
virtue
?
 
<EOS>
Judge
for
me
,
sir
,
and
pardon
me
.
  
<EOS>
Pardon
you
!
<EOS>
said
he
,
<EOS>
What
!
<EOS>
when
you
do
n't
repent
?
 
<EOS>
When
you
have
the
boldness
to
justify
yourself
in
your
fault
?
 
<EOS>
Why
do
n't
you
say
,
you
never
will
again
offend
me
?
 
<EOS>
I
will
endeavour
,
sir
,
said
I
,
always
to
preserve
that
decency
towards
you
which
becomes
me
.
 
<EOS>
But
really
,
sir
,
I
must
beg
your
excuse
for
saying
,
That
when
you
forget
what
belongs
to
decency
in
your
actions
,
and
when
words
are
all
that
are
left
me
,
to
shew
my
resentment
of
such
actions
,
I
will
not
promise
to
forbear
the
strongest
expressions
that
my
distressed
mind
shall
suggest
to
me
:
nor
shall
your
angriest
frowns
deter
me
,
when
my
honesty
is
in
question
.
  
<EOS>
What
,
then
,
said
he
,
do
you
beg
pardon
for
?
 
<EOS>
Where
is
the
promise
of
amendment
,
for
which
I
should
forgive
you
?
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
sir
,
said
I
,
I
own
that
must
absolutely
depend
on
your
usage
of
me
:
<EOS>
for
I
will
bear
any
thing
you
can
inflict
upon
me
with
patience
,
even
to
the
laying
down
of
my
life
,
to
shew
my
obedience
to
you
in
other
cases
;
but
I
can
not
be
patient
,
I
can
not
be
passive
,
when
my
virtue
is
at
stake
!
 
<EOS>
It
would
be
criminal
in
me
,
if
I
was
.
  
<EOS>
He
said
,
he
never
saw
such
a
fool
in
his
life
.
 
<EOS>
And
he
walked
by
the
side
of
me
some
yards
,
without
saying
a
word
,
and
seemed
vexed
;
and
at
last
walked
in
,
bidding
me
attend
him
in
the
garden
,
after
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
So
having
a
little
time
,
I
went
up
,
and
wrote
thus
far
.
  
<EOS>
Wednesday
night
.
  
<EOS>
If
,
my
dear
parents
,
I
am
not
destined
more
surely
than
ever
for
ruin
,
I
have
now
more
comfort
before
me
than
ever
I
yet
knew
:
and
am
either
nearer
<EOS>
my
happiness
,
or
my
misery
,
than
ever
I
was
.
 
<EOS>
God
protect
me
from
the
latter
,
if
it
be
his
blessed
will
!
 
<EOS>
I
have
now
such
a
scene
to
open
to
you
,
that
,
I
know
,
will
alarm
both
your
hopes
and
your
fears
,
as
it
does
mine
.
 
<EOS>
And
this
it
is
:
  
<EOS>
After
my
master
had
dined
,
he
took
a
turn
into
the
stables
,
to
look
at
his
stud
of
horses
;
and
,
when
he
came
in
,
he
opened
the
parlour
-
door
,
where
Mrs.
Jewkes
and
I
sat
at
dinner
;
and
,
at
his
entrance
,
we
both
rose
up
;
but
he
said
,
Sit
still
,
sit
still
,
and
let
me
see
how
you
eat
your
victuals
,
Pamela
.
 
<EOS>
O
,
said
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
very
poorly
,
indeed
,
sir
!
 
<EOS>
No
,
said
I
,
pretty
well
,
sir
,
considering
.
 
<EOS>
None
of
your
considerings
,
said
he
,
pretty
face
;
and
tapped
me
on
the
cheek
.
 
<EOS>
I
blushed
,
but
was
glad
he
was
so
good
-
humoured
;
but
I
could
not
tell
how
to
sit
before
him
,
nor
to
behave
myself
.
 
<EOS>
So
he
said
,
I
know
,
Pamela
,
you
are
a
nice
carver
:
my
mother
used
to
say
so
.
 
<EOS>
My
lady
,
sir
,
said
I
,
was
very
good
to
me
in
every
thing
,
and
would
always
make
me
do
the
honours
of
her
table
for
her
,
when
she
was
with
her
few
select
friends
that
she
loved
.
 
<EOS>
Cut
up
,
said
he
,
that
chicken
.
 
<EOS>
I
did
so
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
said
he
,
and
took
a
knife
and
fork
,
and
put
a
wing
upon
my
plate
,
let
me
see
you
eat
that
.
 
<EOS>
O
sir
,
said
I
,
I
have
eaten
a
whole
breast
of
a
chicken
already
,
and
can
not
eat
so
much
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
said
,
I
must
eat
it
for
his
sake
,
and
he
would
teach
me
to
eat
heartily
:
<EOS>
So
I
did
eat
it
;
but
was
much
confused
at
his
so
kind
and
unusual
freedom
and
condescension
.
 
<EOS>
And
,
good
lack
!
<EOS>
you
ca
n't
imagine
how
Mrs.
Jewkes
looked
and
stared
,
and
how
respectful
she
seemed
to
me
,
and
called
me
good
madam
,
I
'll
assure
you
,
urging
me
to
take
a
little
bit
of
tart
.
  
<EOS>
My
master
took
two
or
three
turns
about
the
room
,
musing
and
thoughtful
,
as
I
had
never
before
seen
him
;
and
at
last
he
went
out
,
saying
,
I
am
going
into
the
garden
:
You
know
,
<EOS>
Pamela
,
what
I
said
to
you
before
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
I
rose
,
and
courtesied
,
saying
,
I
would
attend
his
honour
;
and
he
said
,
Do
,
good
girl
!
  
<EOS>
Well
,
said
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
I
see
how
things
will
go
.
 
<EOS>
O
,
madam
,
as
she
called
me
again
<EOS>
,
I
am
sure
you
are
to
be
our
mistress
!
 
<EOS>
And
then
I
know
what
will
become
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
Ah
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
said
I
,
if
I
can
but
keep
myself
virtuous
,
'
tis
the
most
of
my
ambition
;
and
I
hope
,
no
temptation
shall
make
me
otherwise
.
  
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
I
had
no
reason
to
be
pleased
with
his
treatment
of
me
before
dinner
,
yet
I
made
haste
to
attend
him
;
and
I
found
him
walking
by
the
side
of
that
pond
,
which
,
for
want
of
grace
,
and
through
a
sinful
despondence
,
had
like
to
have
been
so
fatal
to
me
,
and
the
sight
of
which
,
ever
since
,
has
been
a
trouble
and
reproach
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
And
it
was
by
the
side
of
this
pond
,
and
not
far
from
the
place
where
I
had
that
dreaded
conflict
,
that
my
present
hopes
,
if
I
am
not
to
be
deceived
again
,
began
to
dawn
:
<EOS>
which
I
presume
to
flatter
myself
with
being
a
happy
omen
for
me
,
as
if
God
Almighty
would
shew
your
poor
sinful
daughter
,
how
well
I
did
to
put
my
affiance
in
his
goodness
,
and
not
to
throw
away
myself
,
because
my
ruin
seemed
inevitable
,
to
my
short
-
sighted
apprehension
.
  
<EOS>
So
he
was
pleased
to
say
<EOS>
,
Well
,
Pamela
,
I
am
glad
you
are
come
of
your
own
accord
,
as
I
may
say
:
give
me
your
hand
.
 
<EOS>
I
did
so
;
and
he
looked
at
me
very
steadily
,
and
pressing
my
hand
all
the
time
<EOS>
,
at
last
said
,
I
will
now
talk
to
you
in
a
serious
manner
.
  
<EOS>
You
have
a
good
deal
of
wit
,
a
great
deal
of
penetration
,
much
beyond
your
years
,
and
,
as
I
thought
,
your
opportunities
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
possessed
of
an
open
,
frank
,
and
generous
mind
;
and
a
person
so
lovely
,
that
you
excel
all
your
sex
,
in
my
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
All
these
accomplishments
have
engaged
my
affection
so
deeply
,
that
,
as
I
have
often
said
,
I
can
not
live
without
you
;
and
I
would
divide
,
with
all
my
soul
,
my
estate
with
you
,
to
make
you
mine
upon
my
own
terms
.
 
<EOS>
These
you
have
absolutely
rejected
;
and
that
,
though
in
saucy
terms
enough
,
yet
in
such
a
manner
as
makes
me
admire
you
the
more
.
 
<EOS>
Your
pretty
chit
-
chat
to
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
the
last
Sunday
night
,
<EOS>
so
innocent
,
and
so
full
of
beautiful
simplicity
,
half
disarmed
my
resolution
before
I
approached
your
bed
:
<EOS>
And
I
see
you
so
watchful
over
your
virtue
,
that
though
I
hoped
to
find
it
otherwise
,
I
can
not
but
confess
my
passion
for
you
is
increased
by
it
.
 
<EOS>
But
now
,
what
shall
I
say
farther
,
Pamela
?
 
<EOS>
I
will
make
you
,
though
a
party
,
my
adviser
in
this
matter
,
though
not
,
perhaps
,
my
definitive
judge
.
  
<EOS>
You
know
I
am
not
a
very
abandoned
profligate
;
I
have
hitherto
been
guilty
of
no
very
enormous
or
vile
actions
.
 
<EOS>
This
of
seizing
you
,
and
confining
you
thus
,
may
perhaps
be
one
of
the
worst
,
at
least
to
persons
of
real
innocence
.
 
<EOS>
Had
I
been
utterly
given
up
to
my
passions
,
I
should
before
now
have
gratified
them
,
and
not
have
shewn
that
remorse
and
compassion
for
you
,
which
have
reprieved
you
,
more
than
once
,
when
absolutely
in
my
power
;
and
you
are
as
inviolate
a
virgin
as
you
were
when
you
came
into
my
house
.
  
<EOS>
But
what
can
I
do
?
 
<EOS>
Consider
the
pride
of
my
condition
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
endure
the
thought
of
marriage
,
even
with
a
person
of
equal
or
superior
degree
to
myself
;
and
have
declined
several
proposals
of
that
kind
:
How
then
,
with
the
distance
between
us
in
the
world
's
judgment
,
can
I
think
of
making
you
my
wife
?
 
<EOS>
Yet
I
must
have
you
;
I
can
not
bear
the
thoughts
of
any
other
man
supplanting
me
in
your
affections
:
and
the
very
apprehension
of
that
has
made
me
hate
the
name
of
Williams
,
and
use
him
in
a
manner
unworthy
of
my
temper
.
  
<EOS>
Now
,
Pamela
,
judge
for
me
;
and
,
since
I
have
told
you
,
thus
candidly
,
my
mind
,
and
I
see
yours
is
big
with
some
important
meaning
,
by
your
eyes
,
your
blushes
,
and
that
sweet
confusion
which
I
behold
struggling
in
your
bosom
,
tell
me
,
with
like
openness
and
candour
,
what
you
think
I
ought
to
do
,
and
what
you
would
have
me
do
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
impossible
for
me
to
express
the
agitations
of
my
mind
,
on
this
unexpected
declaration
,
so
contrary
to
his
former
behaviour
.
 
<EOS>
His
manner
too
had
something
so
noble
,
and
so
sincere
,
as
I
thought
,
<EOS>
that
,
alas
for
me
!
 
<EOS>
I
found
I
had
need
of
all
my
poor
discretion
,
to
ward
off
the
blow
which
this
treatment
gave
to
my
most
guarded
thoughts
.
 
<EOS>
I
threw
myself
at
his
feet
;
for
I
trembled
,
and
could
hardly
stand
:
<EOS>
O
sir
,
said
I
,
spare
your
poor
servant
's
confusion
!
 
<EOS>
O
spare
the
poor
Pamela
!
 
<EOS>
Speak
out
,
said
he
,
and
tell
me
,
when
I
bid
you
,
What
you
think
I
ought
to
do
?
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
say
what
you
ought
to
do
,
answered
I
:
<EOS>
but
I
only
beg
you
will
not
ruin
me
;
and
,
if
you
think
me
virtuous
,
if
you
think
me
sincerely
honest
,
let
me
go
to
my
poor
parents
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
vow
to
you
,
that
I
will
never
suffer
myself
to
be
engaged
without
your
approbation
.
  
<EOS>
Still
he
insisted
upon
a
more
explicit
answer
to
his
question
,
of
what
I
thought
he
ought
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
did
,
<EOS>
As
to
my
poor
thoughts
of
what
you
ought
to
do
,
I
must
needs
say
,
that
indeed
I
think
you
ought
to
regard
the
world
's
opinion
,
and
avoid
doing
any
thing
disgraceful
to
your
birth
and
fortune
;
and
,
therefore
,
if
you
really
honour
the
poor
Pamela
with
your
respect
,
a
little
time
,
absence
,
and
the
conversation
of
worthier
persons
of
my
sex
,
will
effectually
enable
you
to
overcome
a
regard
so
unworthy
your
condition
:
<EOS>
And
this
,
good
sir
,
is
the
best
advice
I
can
offer
.
  
<EOS>
Charming
creature
!
<EOS>
lovely
Pamela
!
<EOS>
said
he
,
(
with
an
ardour
that
was
never
before
so
agreeable
to
me
,
)
<EOS>
this
generous
manner
is
of
a
piece
with
all
the
rest
of
your
conduct
.
 
<EOS>
But
tell
me
,
still
more
explicitly
,
what
you
would
advise
me
to
,
in
the
case
.
  
<EOS>
O
,
sir
!
<EOS>
said
I
,
take
not
advantage
of
my
credulity
,
and
these
my
weak
moments
:
but
were
I
the
first
lady
in
the
land
,
instead
of
the
poor
abject
Pamela
<EOS>
,
I
would
,
I
could
tell
you
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
can
say
no
more
   
<EOS>
O
<EOS>
my
dear
father
and
mother
!
<EOS>
now
I
know
you
will
indeed
be
concerned
for
me
;
 
for
now
I
am
for
myself
.
 
<EOS>
And
now
I
begin
to
be
afraid
<EOS>
I
know
too
well
<EOS>
the
reason
why
all
his
hard
trials
of
me
,
and
my
black
apprehensions
,
would
not
let
me
hate
him
.
  
<EOS>
But
be
assured
still
,
by
God
's
grace
<EOS>
,
that
I
shall
do
nothing
unworthy
of
your
Pamela
;
and
if
I
find
that
he
is
still
capable
of
deceiving
me
,
and
that
this
conduct
is
only
put
on
to
delude
me
more
,
I
shall
think
nothing
in
this
world
so
vile
,
and
so
odious
;
and
nothing
,
if
he
be
not
the
worst
of
his
kind
,
(
as
he
says
,
and
,
<EOS>
I
hope
,
he
is
not
,
)
so
desperately
guileful
,
as
the
heart
of
man
.
  
<EOS>
He
generously
said
,
I
will
spare
your
confusion
,
Pamela
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
hope
I
may
promise
myself
,
that
you
can
love
me
preferably
to
any
other
man
;
and
that
no
one
in
the
world
has
had
any
share
in
your
affections
;
for
I
am
very
jealous
of
what
I
love
;
and
if
I
thought
you
had
a
secret
whispering
in
your
soul
,
that
had
not
yet
come
up
to
a
wish
,
for
any
other
man
breathing
,
I
should
not
forgive
myself
to
persist
in
my
affection
for
you
;
nor
you
,
if
you
did
not
frankly
acquaint
me
with
it
.
  
<EOS>
As
I
still
continued
on
my
knees
,
on
the
grass
border
by
the
pond
-
side
,
he
sat
himself
down
on
the
grass
by
me
,
and
took
me
in
his
arms
:
<EOS>
Why
hesitates
my
Pamela
?
<EOS>
said
he
.
 
<EOS>
Can
you
not
answer
me
with
truth
,
as
I
wish
?
 
<EOS>
If
you
can
not
,
speak
,
and
I
will
forgive
you
.
  
<EOS>
O
good
sir
<EOS>
,
said
I
,
it
is
not
that
;
indeed
it
is
not
:
but
a
frightful
word
or
two
that
you
said
to
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
when
you
thought
I
was
not
in
hearing
,
comes
cross
my
mind
;
and
makes
me
dread
that
I
am
in
more
danger
than
ever
I
was
in
my
life
.
  
<EOS>
You
have
never
found
me
a
common
liar
,
said
he
,
(
too
fearful
and
foolish
Pamela
!
)
<EOS>
nor
will
I
answer
how
long
I
may
hold
in
my
present
mind
;
for
my
pride
struggles
hard
within
me
<EOS>
,
I
'll
assure
you
;
and
if
you
doubt
me
,
I
have
no
obligation
to
your
confidence
or
opinion
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
at
present
,
I
am
really
sincere
in
what
I
say
:
<EOS>
And
I
expect
you
will
be
so
too
;
and
answer
directly
my
question
.
  
<EOS>
I
find
,
sir
,
said
I
,
I
know
not
myself
;
and
your
question
is
of
such
a
nature
,
that
I
only
want
to
tell
you
what
I
heard
,
and
to
have
your
kind
answer
to
it
;
or
else
,
what
I
have
to
say
to
your
question
,
may
pave
the
way
to
my
ruin
,
and
shew
a
weakness
that
I
did
not
believe
was
in
me
.
  
<EOS>
Well
,
said
he
,
you
may
say
what
you
have
overheard
;
for
,
in
not
answering
me
directly
,
you
put
my
soul
upon
the
rack
;
and
half
the
trouble
I
have
had
with
you
would
have
brought
to
my
arms
one
of
the
finest
ladies
in
England
.
  
<EOS>
O
sir
,
said
I
,
my
virtue
is
as
dear
to
me
,
as
if
I
was
of
the
highest
quality
;
and
my
doubts
(
for
which
you
know
I
have
had
too
much
reason
)
have
made
me
troublesome
.
 
<EOS>
But
now
,
sir
,
I
will
tell
you
what
I
heard
,
which
has
given
me
great
uneasiness
.
  
<EOS>
You
talked
to
Mrs.
Jewkes
of
having
begun
wrong
with
me
,
in
trying
to
subdue
me
with
terror
,
and
of
frost
,
and
such
like
 
<EOS>
You
remember
it
well
:
 
And
that
you
would
,
for
the
future
,
change
your
conduct
,
and
try
to
melt
me
,
that
was
your
word
,
by
kindness
.
  
<EOS>
I
fear
not
,
sir
,
the
grace
of
God
supporting
me
,
that
any
acts
of
kindness
would
make
me
forget
what
I
owe
to
my
virtue
:
but
,
sir
,
I
may
,
I
find
,
be
made
more
miserable
by
such
acts
,
than
by
terror
;
because
my
nature
is
too
frank
and
open
to
make
me
wish
to
be
ungrateful
:
and
if
I
should
be
taught
a
lesson
I
never
yet
learnt
,
with
what
regret
should
I
descend
to
the
grave
,
to
think
that
I
could
not
hate
my
undoer
:
and
that
,
at
the
last
great
day
,
I
must
stand
up
as
an
accuser
of
the
poor
unhappy
soul
,
that
I
could
wish
it
in
my
power
to
save
!
  
<EOS>
Exalted
girl
!
<EOS>
said
he
,
what
a
thought
is
that
!
 
<EOS>
Why
,
now
,
Pamela
,
you
excel
yourself
!
 
<EOS>
You
have
given
me
a
hint
that
will
hold
me
long
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
sweet
creature
,
said
he
,
tell
me
what
is
this
lesson
,
which
you
never
yet
learnt
,
and
which
you
are
so
afraid
of
learning
?
  
<EOS>
If
,
sir
,
said
I
,
you
will
again
generously
spare
my
confusion
<EOS>
,
I
need
not
speak
it
:
<EOS>
But
this
I
will
say
,
in
answer
to
the
question
you
seem
most
solicitous
about
,
that
I
know
not
the
man
breathing
that
I
would
wish
to
be
married
to
,
or
that
ever
I
thought
of
with
such
an
idea
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
brought
my
mind
so
to
love
poverty
<EOS>
,
that
I
hoped
for
nothing
but
to
return
to
the
best
,
though
the
poorest
of
parents
;
and
to
employ
myself
in
serving
God
,
and
comforting
them
;
and
you
know
not
,
sir
,
how
you
disappointed
those
hopes
,
and
my
proposed
honest
pleasures
,
when
you
sent
me
hither
.
  
<EOS>
Well
then
,
said
he
,
<EOS>
I
may
promise
myself
,
that
neither
the
parson
,
nor
any
other
man
,
is
any
the
least
secret
motive
to
your
steadfast
refusal
of
my
offers
?
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
sir
,
said
I
,
you
may
;
and
,
as
you
was
pleased
to
ask
,
I
answer
,
that
I
have
not
the
least
shadow
of
a
wish
,
or
thought
,
for
any
man
living
.
  
<EOS>
But
,
said
he
,
(
for
I
am
foolishly
jealous
,
and
yet
it
shews
my
fondness
for
you
,
)
<EOS>
have
you
not
encouraged
Williams
to
think
you
will
have
him
?
<EOS>
Indeed
,
sir
,
said
I
,
I
have
not
;
but
the
very
contrary
.
 
<EOS>
And
would
you
not
have
had
him
,
said
he
,
if
you
had
got
away
by
his
means
?
 
<EOS>
I
had
resolved
,
sir
,
said
I
,
in
my
mind
,
otherwise
;
and
he
knew
it
;
and
the
poor
man
 
I
charge
you
,
said
he
,
say
not
a
word
in
his
favour
!
 
<EOS>
You
will
excite
a
whirlwind
in
my
soul
,
if
you
name
him
with
kindness
;
and
then
you
'll
be
borne
away
with
the
tempest
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
,
said
I
,
I
have
done
!
 
<EOS>
Nay
,
said
he
,
but
do
not
have
done
;
let
me
know
the
whole
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
have
any
regard
for
him
,
speak
out
;
for
it
would
end
fearfully
for
you
,
for
me
,
and
for
him
,
if
I
found
that
you
disguised
any
secret
of
your
soul
from
me
,
in
this
nice
particular
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
,
said
I
,
if
I
have
ever
given
you
cause
to
think
me
sincere
 
<EOS>
Say
then
,
said
he
,
interrupting
me
with
great
vehemence
,
and
taking
both
my
hands
between
his
,
Say
,
that
you
now
,
in
the
presence
of
God
,
declare
that
you
have
not
any
the
most
hidden
regard
for
Williams
,
or
any
other
man
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
,
said
I
,
I
do
.
 
<EOS>
As
God
shall
bless
me
,
and
preserve
my
innocence
,
I
have
not
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
said
he
,
I
will
believe
you
,
Pamela
;
and
in
time
,
perhaps
,
I
may
better
bear
that
man
's
name
.
 
<EOS>
And
,
if
I
am
convinced
that
you
are
not
prepossessed
,
my
vanity
makes
me
assured
,
that
I
need
not
to
fear
a
place
in
your
esteem
,
equal
,
if
not
preferable
,
to
any
man
in
England
.
 
<EOS>
But
yet
it
stings
my
pride
to
the
quick
,
that
you
was
so
easily
brought
,
and
at
such
a
short
acquaintance
,
to
run
away
with
that
college
novice
!
  
<EOS>
O
good
sir
,
said
I
,
may
I
be
heard
one
thing
?
 
<EOS>
And
though
I
bring
upon
me
your
highest
indignation
,
I
will
tell
you
,
perhaps
,
the
unnecessary
and
imprudent
,
but
yet
the
whole
truth
.
  
<EOS>
My
honesty
(
I
am
poor
and
lowly
,
and
am
not
entitled
to
call
it
honour
)
was
in
danger
.
 
<EOS>
I
saw
no
means
of
securing
myself
from
your
avowed
attempts
.
 
<EOS>
You
had
shewed
you
would
not
stick
at
little
matters
;
and
what
,
sir
,
could
any
body
have
thought
of
my
sincerity
,
in
preferring
that
to
all
other
considerations
,
if
I
had
not
escaped
from
these
dangers
,
if
I
could
have
found
any
way
for
it
?
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
going
to
say
any
thing
for
him
;
but
,
indeed
,
indeed
,
sir
,
I
was
the
cause
of
putting
him
upon
assisting
me
in
my
escape
.
 
<EOS>
I
got
him
to
acquaint
me
<EOS>
what
gentry
there
were
in
the
neighbourhood
that
I
might
fly
to
;
and
prevailed
upon
him
 
Do
n't
frown
at
me
,
good
sir
;
for
I
must
tell
you
the
whole
truth
 
to
apply
to
one
Lady
Jones
;
to
Lady
Darnford
;
and
he
was
so
good
to
apply
to
Mr.
Peters
,
the
minister
:
<EOS>
But
they
all
refused
me
;
and
then
it
was
he
let
me
know
,
that
there
was
no
honourable
way
but
marriage
.
 
<EOS>
That
I
declined
;
and
he
agreed
to
assist
me
for
God
's
sake
.
  
<EOS>
Now
,
said
he
,
you
are
going
 
<EOS>
I
boldly
put
my
hand
before
his
mouth
,
hardly
knowing
the
liberty
I
took
:
Pray
,
sir
<EOS>
,
said
I
,
do
n't
be
angry
;
I
have
just
done
 
<EOS>
I
would
only
say
,
that
rather
than
have
staid
to
be
ruined
,
I
would
have
thrown
myself
upon
the
poorest
beggar
that
ever
the
world
saw
,
if
I
thought
him
honest
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
hope
,
when
you
duly
weigh
all
matters
,
you
will
forgive
me
,
and
not
think
me
so
bold
,
and
so
forward
,
as
you
have
been
pleased
to
call
me
.
  
<EOS>
Well
,
said
he
,
even
in
this
your
last
speech
,
which
,
let
me
tell
you
,
shews
more
your
honesty
of
heart
than
your
prudence
,
you
have
not
over
-
much
pleased
me
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
must
love
you
;
and
that
vexes
me
not
a
little
.
<EOS>
But
tell
me
,
Pamela
,
for
now
the
former
question
recurs
:
<EOS>
Since
you
so
much
prize
your
honour
,
and
your
virtue
;
since
all
attempts
against
that
are
so
odious
to
you
;
and
since
I
have
avowedly
made
several
of
these
attempts
,
do
you
think
it
is
possible
for
you
to
love
me
preferably
to
any
other
of
my
sex
?
  
<EOS>
Ah
,
sir
!
<EOS>
said
I
,
and
here
my
doubt
recurs
,
that
you
may
thus
graciously
use
me
,
to
take
advantage
of
my
credulity
.
  
<EOS>
Still
perverse
and
doubting
!
<EOS>
said
he
 
<EOS>
Can
not
you
take
me
as
I
am
at
present
?
 
<EOS>
And
that
,
I
have
told
you
,
is
sincere
and
undesigning
,
whatever
I
may
be
hereafter
.
  
<EOS>
Ah
,
sir
!
<EOS>
replied
I
<EOS>
,
what
can
I
say
?
 
<EOS>
I
have
already
said
too
much
,
if
this
dreadful
hereafter
should
take
place
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
bid
me
say
how
well
I
can
 
<EOS>
And
then
,
my
face
glowing
as
the
fire
,
I
,
all
abashed
,
leaned
upon
his
shoulder
,
to
hide
my
confusion
.
  
<EOS>
He
clasped
me
to
him
with
great
ardour
,
and
said
,
Hide
your
dear
face
in
my
bosom
,
my
beloved
Pamela
!
<EOS>
your
innocent
freedoms
charm
me
!
 
<EOS>
But
then
say
,
<EOS>
How
well
 
what
?
  
<EOS>
If
you
will
be
good
,
said
I
,
to
your
poor
servant
,
and
spare
her
,
I
can
not
say
too
much
!
 
<EOS>
But
if
not
,
I
am
doubly
undone
!
 
<EOS>
Undone
indeed
!
  
<EOS>
Said
he
,
<EOS>
I
hope
my
present
temper
will
hold
;
for
I
tell
you
frankly
,
that
I
have
known
,
in
this
agreeable
hour
,
more
sincere
pleasure
than
I
have
experienced
in
all
the
guilty
tumults
that
my
desiring
soul
compelled
me
into
,
in
the
hopes
of
possessing
you
on
my
own
terms
.
 
<EOS>
And
,
Pamela
,
you
must
pray
for
the
continuance
of
this
temper
;
and
I
hope
your
prayers
will
get
the
better
of
my
temptations
.
  
<EOS>
This
sweet
goodness
overpowered
all
my
reserves
.
 
<EOS>
I
threw
myself
at
his
feet
,
and
embraced
his
knees
:
<EOS>
What
pleasure
,
sir
,
you
give
me
at
these
gracious
words
,
is
not
lent
your
poor
servant
to
express
!
 
<EOS>
I
shall
be
too
much
rewarded
for
all
my
sufferings
,
if
this
goodness
hold
!
 
<EOS>
God
grant
it
<EOS>
may
,
for
your
own
soul
's
sake
as
well
as
mine
.
 
<EOS>
And
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
how
happy
should
I
be
,
if
     
He
stopt
me
,
and
said
,
<EOS>
But
,
my
dear
girl
,
what
must
we
do
about
the
world
,
and
the
world
's
censure
?
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
I
can
not
marry
!
  
<EOS>
Now
was
I
again
struck
all
of
a
heap
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
soon
recollecting
myself
,
Sir
,
said
I
,
I
have
not
the
presumption
to
hope
such
an
honour
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
may
be
permitted
to
return
in
peace
and
safety
to
my
poor
parents
,
to
pray
for
you
there
,
it
is
all
I
at
present
request
!
 
<EOS>
This
,
sir
,
after
all
my
apprehensions
and
dangers
,
will
be
a
great
pleasure
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
And
,
if
I
know
my
own
poor
heart
,
I
shall
wish
you
happy
in
a
lady
of
suitable
degree
;
and
rejoice
most
sincerely
in
every
circumstance
that
shall
make
for
the
happiness
of
my
late
good
lady
's
most
beloved
son
.
  
<EOS>
Well
,
said
he
,
this
conversation
,
Pamela
,
is
gone
farther
than
I
intended
it
.
 
<EOS>
You
need
not
be
afraid
,
at
this
rate
,
of
trusting
yourself
with
me
:
but
it
is
I
that
ought
to
be
doubtful
of
myself
,
when
I
am
with
you
.
 
<EOS>
But
before
I
say
any
thing
farther
on
this
subject
,
I
will
take
my
proud
heart
to
task
;
and
,
till
then
,
let
every
thing
be
as
if
this
conversation
had
never
passed
.
 
<EOS>
Only
,
let
me
tell
you
,
that
the
more
confidence
you
place
in
me
,
the
more
you
'll
oblige
me
:
but
your
doubts
will
only
beget
cause
of
doubts
.
 
<EOS>
And
with
this
ambiguous
saying
,
he
saluted
me
with
a
more
formal
manner
,
if
I
may
so
say
,
than
before
,
and
lent
me
his
hand
;
and
so
we
walked
toward
the
house
,
side
by
side
<EOS>
,
he
seeming
very
thoughtful
and
pensive
,
as
if
he
had
already
repented
him
of
his
goodness
.
  
<EOS>
What
shall
I
do
,
<EOS>
what
steps
take
,
if
all
this
be
designing
 
O
the
perplexities
of
these
cruel
doubtings
!
 
<EOS>
To
be
sure
,
if
he
be
false
,
as
I
may
call
it
,
I
have
gone
too
far
,
much
too
far
!
 
<EOS>
I
am
ready
,
on
the
apprehension
of
this
,
to
bite
my
forward
tongue
(
or
rather
to
beat
my
more
forward
heart
,
that
dictated
to
that
poor
machine
)
for
what
I
have
said
.
 
<EOS>
But
sure
,
at
least
,
he
must
be
sincere
for
the
time
!
 
<EOS>
He
could
not
be
such
a
practised
dissembler
!
 
<EOS>
If
he
could
,
O
how
desperately
wicked
is
the
heart
of
man
!
 
<EOS>
And
where
could
he
learn
all
these
barbarous
arts
?
 
<EOS>
If
so
,
it
must
be
native
surely
to
the
sex
!
 
<EOS>
But
,
silent
be
my
rash
censurings
;
be
hushed
,
<EOS>
ye
stormy
tumults
of
my
disturbed
mind
!
<EOS>
for
have
I
not
a
father
who
is
a
man
?
 
<EOS>
A
man
who
knows
no
guile
!
<EOS>
who
would
do
no
wrong
!
 
<EOS>
who
would
not
deceive
or
oppress
,
to
gain
a
kingdom
!
 
<EOS>
How
then
can
I
think
it
is
native
to
the
sex
?
 
<EOS>
And
I
must
also
hope
my
good
lady
's
son
can
not
be
the
worst
of
men
!
 
<EOS>
If
he
is
,
hard
the
lot
of
the
excellent
woman
that
bore
him
!
 
<EOS>
But
much
harder
the
hap
of
your
poor
Pamela
,
who
has
fallen
into
such
hands
!
 
<EOS>
But
yet
I
will
trust
in
God
,
and
hope
the
best
:
and
so
lay
down
my
tired
pen
for
this
time
.
  
<EOS>
Thursday
morning
.
  
<EOS>
Somebody
rapped
at
our
chamber
-
door
this
morning
,
soon
after
it
was
light
:
Mrs.
Jewkes
asked
,
who
it
was
?
 
<EOS>
My
master
said
,
<EOS>
Open
the
door
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
!
 
<EOS>
O
,
said
I
,
for
God
's
sake
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
do
n't
!
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
said
she
,
but
I
must
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
said
I
,
and
clung
about
her
,
let
me
slip
on
my
clothes
first
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
rapped
again
,
and
she
broke
from
me
;
and
I
was
frightened
out
of
my
wits
,
and
folded
myself
in
the
bed
-
clothes
.
 
<EOS>
He
entered
,
and
said
,
What
,
Pamela
,
<EOS>
so
fearful
,
after
what
passed
yesterday
between
us
!
 
<EOS>
O
,
sir
,
sir
,
said
I
<EOS>
,
I
fear
my
prayers
have
wanted
their
wished
effect
!
 
<EOS>
Pray
,
good
sir
,
consider
 
He
sat
down
on
the
bed
-
side
,
and
interrupted
me
;
No
need
of
your
foolish
fears
;
I
shall
say
but
a
word
or
two
,
and
go
away
.
  
<EOS>
After
you
went
up
stairs
,
said
he
,
I
had
an
invitation
to
a
ball
,
which
is
to
be
this
night
at
Stamford
,
on
occasion
of
a
wedding
;
and
I
am
going
to
call
on
Sir
Simon
,
and
his
lady
and
daughters
;
for
the
bride
is
a
relation
of
theirs
:
<EOS>
so
I
shall
not
be
at
home
till
Saturday
.
 
<EOS>
I
come
,
therefore
,
to
caution
you
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
before
Pamela
,
(
that
she
may
not
wonder
at
being
closer
confined
,
than
for
these
three
or
four
days
past
,
)
<EOS>
that
nobody
sees
her
,
nor
delivers
any
letter
to
her
,
in
that
space
;
for
a
person
has
been
seen
lurking
about
,
and
inquiring
after
her
,
and
I
have
been
well
informed
,
that
either
Mrs.
Jervis
,
or
Mr.
Longman
,
has
written
a
letter
,
with
a
design
of
having
it
conveyed
to
her
:
<EOS>
And
,
said
he
,
you
must
know
,
Pamela
,
that
I
have
ordered
Mr.
Longman
to
give
up
his
accounts
,
and
have
dismissed
Jonathan
and
Mrs.
Jervis
,
since
I
have
been
here
;
for
their
behaviour
has
been
intolerable
;
and
they
have
made
such
a
breach
between
my
sister
Davers
and
me
,
as
we
shall
never
,
perhaps
,
make
up
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
Pamela
,
I
shall
take
it
kindly
in
you
,
if
you
will
confine
yourself
to
your
chamber
pretty
much
,
for
the
time
I
am
absent
,
and
not
give
Mrs.
Jewkes
cause
of
trouble
or
uneasiness
;
and
the
rather
,
as
you
know
she
acts
by
my
orders
.
  
<EOS>
Alas
!
<EOS>
sir
,
said
I
,
I
fear
all
these
good
people
have
suffered
for
my
sake
!
 
<EOS>
Why
,
said
he
,
<EOS>
I
believe
so
too
;
and
there
was
never
a
girl
of
your
innocence
,
that
set
a
large
family
in
such
an
uproar
,
surely
.
 
<EOS>
But
let
that
pass
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
both
of
you
<EOS>
my
mind
,
and
,
in
part
,
the
reason
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
shall
only
say
,
that
I
have
had
such
a
letter
from
my
sister
,
as
I
could
not
have
expected
;
and
,
Pamela
,
said
he
,
neither
you
nor
I
have
reason
to
thank
her
,
as
you
shall
know
,
perhaps
at
my
return
.
 
<EOS>
I
go
in
my
coach
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
because
I
take
Lady
Darnford
,
and
Mrs.
Peters
's
niece
,
and
one
of
Lady
Darnford
's
daughters
,
along
with
me
;
and
Sir
Simon
and
his
other
daughter
go
in
his
chariot
:
<EOS>
so
let
all
the
gates
be
fastened
;
and
do
n't
take
any
airing
in
either
of
the
chariots
,
nor
let
any
body
go
to
the
gate
,
without
you
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
be
sure
,
said
she
,
to
obey
your
honour
.
  
<EOS>
I
will
give
Mrs.
Jewkes
no
trouble
,
sir
,
said
I
;
and
will
keep
pretty
much
in
my
chamber
,
and
not
stir
so
much
as
into
the
garden
without
her
;
to
shew
you
I
will
obey
in
every
thing
I
can
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
begin
to
fear
 
Ay
,
said
he
,
more
plots
and
contrivances
,
do
n't
you
?
 
<EOS>
But
I
'll
assure
you
,
you
never
had
less
reason
;
and
I
tell
you
the
truth
;
for
I
am
really
going
to
Stamford
this
time
;
and
upon
the
occasion
I
tell
you
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
,
Pamela
,
give
me
your
hand
,
and
one
kiss
;
and
then
I
am
gone
.
  
<EOS>
I
durst
not
refuse
,
and
said
,
God
bless
you
,
sir
,
wherever
you
go
!
 
<EOS>
But
I
am
sorry
for
what
you
tell
me
about
your
servants
!
  
<EOS>
He
and
Mrs.
Jewkes
had
a
little
talk
without
the
door
;
and
I
heard
her
say
,
You
may
depend
,
sir
,
upon
my
care
and
vigilance
.
  
<EOS>
He
went
in
his
coach
,
as
he
said
he
should
,
and
very
richly
dressed
,
which
looks
as
if
what
he
said
was
likely
:
but
really
I
have
been
used
to
so
many
tricks
,
and
plots
,
and
surprises
,
<EOS>
that
I
know
not
what
to
think
.
<EOS>
But
I
mourn
for
poor
Mrs.
Jervis
.
 
<EOS>
So
here
is
Parson
Williams
;
here
's
poor
naughty
John
;
here
is
good
Mrs.
Jervis
,
and
Mr.
Longman
,
and
Mr.
Jonathan
,
turned
away
for
me
!
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Longman
is
rich
,
indeed
,
and
so
need
the
less
matter
it
;
but
I
know
it
will
grieve
him
:
and
for
poor
Mr.
Jonathan
,
I
am
sure
it
will
cut
that
good
old
servant
to
the
heart
.
 
<EOS>
Alas
for
me
!
<EOS>
what
mischiefs
am
I
the
occasion
of
!
 
<EOS>
Or
,
rather
,
my
master
,
whose
actions
towards
me
have
made
so
many
of
my
kind
friends
forfeit
his
favour
,
for
my
sake
!
  
<EOS>
I
am
very
sad
about
these
things
:
If
he
really
loved
me
,
methinks
he
should
not
be
so
angry
,
that
his
servants
loved
me
too
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
not
what
to
think
!
  
<EOS>
Friday
night
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
removed
my
papers
from
under
the
rose
-
bush
;
for
I
saw
the
gardener
begin
to
dig
near
that
spot
;
and
I
was
afraid
he
would
find
them
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
and
I
were
looking
yesterday
through
the
iron
gate
that
fronts
the
elms
;
and
a
gipsy
-
like
body
made
up
to
us
,
and
said
;
<EOS>
If
,
madam
,
you
will
give
me
some
broken
victuals
,
I
will
tell
you
both
your
fortunes
.
 
<EOS>
I
said
,
Let
us
hear
our
fortunes
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
.
 
<EOS>
She
said
,
I
do
n't
like
these
sort
of
people
;
but
we
will
hear
what
she
'll
say
to
us
,
however
.
 
<EOS>
I
sha
n't
fetch
you
any
victuals
,
woman
;
but
I
will
give
you
some
pence
,
said
she
.
  
<EOS>
But
Nan
coming
out
,
she
said
,
Fetch
some
bread
,
and
some
of
the
cold
meat
,
and
you
shall
have
your
fortune
told
,
Nan
.
  
<EOS>
This
,
you
'll
think
,
like
some
of
my
other
matters
,
a
very
trifling
thing
to
write
about
.
 
<EOS>
But
mark
the
discovery
of
a
dreadful
plot
,
which
I
have
made
by
it
.
 
<EOS>
O
,
bless
me
!
 
<EOS>
What
can
I
think
of
this
naughty
<EOS>
,
this
very
naughty
gentleman
!
 
<EOS>
Now
will
I
hate
him
most
heartily
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
it
was
:
    
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
had
no
suspicion
of
the
woman
,
the
iron
gate
being
locked
,
and
she
on
the
outside
,
and
we
on
the
inside
;
and
so
put
her
hand
through
.
 
<EOS>
She
said
,
muttering
over
a
parcel
of
cramp
words
;
Why
,
madam
,
you
will
marry
soon
,
I
can
tell
you
.
 
<EOS>
At
that
she
seemed
pleased
,
and
said
,
I
am
glad
to
hear
that
;
and
shook
her
fat
sides
with
laughing
.
 
<EOS>
The
woman
looked
most
earnestly
at
me
,
all
the
time
,
and
as
if
she
had
meaning
.
 
<EOS>
Then
it
came
into
my
head
,
from
my
master
's
caution
,
that
possibly
this
woman
might
be
employed
to
try
to
get
a
letter
into
my
hands
;
and
I
was
resolved
to
watch
all
her
motions
.
 
<EOS>
So
Mrs.
Jewkes
said
,
What
sort
of
a
man
shall
I
have
,
pray
?
 
<EOS>
Why
,
said
she
,
a
man
younger
than
yourself
;
and
a
very
good
husband
he
'll
prove
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
glad
of
that
,
said
she
;
and
laughed
again
.
 
<EOS>
Come
,
madam
,
let
us
hear
your
fortune
.
  
<EOS>
The
woman
came
to
me
,
and
took
my
hand
.
 
<EOS>
O
!
<EOS>
said
she
,
I
can
not
tell
your
fortune
:
<EOS>
your
hand
is
so
white
and
fine
<EOS>
,
I
can
not
see
the
lines
:
but
,
said
she
,
and
,
stooping
,
pulled
up
a
little
tuft
of
grass
,
I
have
a
way
for
that
;
and
so
rubbed
my
hand
with
the
mould
part
of
the
tuft
:
Now
,
said
she
,
I
can
see
the
lines
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
was
very
watchful
of
all
her
ways
,
and
took
the
tuft
,
and
looked
upon
it
,
lest
any
thing
should
be
in
that
.
 
<EOS>
And
then
the
woman
said
,
Here
is
the
line
of
Jupiter
crossing
the
line
of
life
;
and
Mars
 
Odd
!
<EOS>
my
pretty
mistress
,
said
she
,
you
had
best
take
care
of
yourself
;
for
you
are
hard
beset
,
I
'll
assure
you
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
never
be
married
,
I
can
see
;
and
will
die
of
your
first
child
.
 
<EOS>
Out
upon
thee
,
woman
!
<EOS>
said
I
,
better
thou
hadst
never
come
here
.
  
<EOS>
Said
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
whispering
,
I
do
n't
like
this
<EOS>
:
it
looks
like
a
cheat
:
<EOS>
Pray
,
Mrs.
Pamela
,
go
in
,
this
moment
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
will
,
said
I
;
for
I
have
enough
of
fortune
-
telling
.
 
<EOS>
And
in
I
went
.
  
<EOS>
The
woman
wanted
sadly
to
tell
me
more
,
which
made
Mrs.
Jewkes
threaten
her
,
suspecting
still
the
more
;
and
away
the
woman
went
,
having
told
Nan
her
fortune
,
and
she
would
be
drowned
.
  
<EOS>
This
thing
ran
strongly
in
all
our
heads
;
and
we
went
,
an
hour
after
,
to
see
if
the
woman
was
lurking
about
,
and
took
Mr.
Colbrand
for
our
guard
.
<EOS>
Looking
through
the
iron
gate
,
he
spied
a
man
sauntering
about
the
middle
of
the
walk
;
which
filled
Mrs.
Jewkes
with
still
more
suspicions
;
and
she
said
,
Mr.
Colbrand
,
you
and
I
will
walk
towards
this
fellow
,
and
see
what
he
saunters
there
for
:
<EOS>
And
,
Nan
,
do
you
and
madam
stay
at
the
gate
.
  
<EOS>
So
they
opened
the
iron
gate
and
walked
down
towards
the
man
;
and
guessing
the
woman
,
if
employed
,
must
mean
something
by
the
tuft
of
grass
,
I
cast
my
eye
that
way
,
whence
she
pulled
it
,
and
saw
more
grass
seemingly
pulled
up
:
then
I
doubted
not
something
was
there
for
me
;
and
I
walked
to
it
,
and
standing
over
it
,
said
to
Nan
,
That
's
a
pretty
sort
of
wild
flower
,
that
grows
yonder
,
near
the
elm
,
the
fifth
from
us
on
the
left
;
pray
pull
it
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
Said
she
<EOS>
,
It
is
a
common
weed
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
said
I
,
but
pull
it
for
me
;
there
are
sometimes
beautiful
colours
in
a
weed
.
  
<EOS>
While
she
went
on
,
I
stooped
,
and
pulled
up
a
good
handful
of
the
grass
,
and
in
it
a
bit
of
paper
,
which
I
put
instantly
in
my
bosom
,
and
dropt
the
grass
:
and
my
heart
went
pit
-
a
-
pat
at
the
odd
adventure
.
 
<EOS>
Said
I
,
<EOS>
Let
's
go
in
,
Mrs.
Anne
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
said
she
,
we
must
stay
till
Mrs.
Jewkes
comes
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
all
impatience
to
read
this
paper
:
and
when
Colbrand
and
she
returned
,
I
went
in
.
 
<EOS>
Said
she
,
Certainly
there
is
some
reason
for
my
master
's
caution
:
I
can
make
nothing
of
this
sauntering
fellow
;
but
,
to
be
sure
,
there
was
some
roguery
in
the
gipsy
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
said
I
,
if
there
was
,
she
lost
her
aim
,
you
see
!
 
<EOS>
Ay
,
very
true
,
said
she
;
but
that
was
owing
to
my
watchfulness
;
and
you
was
very
good
to
go
away
,
when
I
spoke
to
you
.
  
<EOS>
I
hastened
up
stairs
to
my
closet
,
and
found
the
billet
to
contain
,
in
a
hand
that
seemed
disguised
,
and
bad
spelling
,
the
following
words
:
   
'
Twenty
contrivances
have
been
thought
of
to
let
you
know
your
danger
:
<EOS>
but
all
have
proved
in
vain
.
 
<EOS>
Your
friends
hope
it
is
not
yet
too
late
to
give
you
this
caution
,
if
it
reaches
your
hands
.
 
<EOS>
The
"
squire
is
absolutely
determined
to
ruin
you
;
and
,
because
he
despairs
of
any
other
way
,
he
will
pretend
great
love
and
kindness
to
you
,
and
that
he
will
marry
you
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
expect
a
parson
,
for
this
purpose
,
in
a
few
days
;
but
it
is
a
sly
artful
fellow
,
of
a
broken
attorney
,
that
he
has
hired
to
personate
a
minister
.
 
<EOS>
The
man
has
a
broad
face
,
pitted
much
with
the
small
-
pox
,
and
is
a
very
great
companion
.
 
<EOS>
So
take
care
of
yourself
.
<EOS>
Doubt
not
this
advice
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
you
'll
have
had
but
too
much
reason
already
to
confirm
you
in
the
truth
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
From
your
zealous
well
-
wisher

"
SOMEBODY

"
  
<EOS>
Now
,
my
dear
father
and
mother
,
what
shall
we
say
of
this
truly
diabolical
master
!
 
<EOS>
O
,
how
shall
I
find
words
to
paint
my
griefs
,
and
his
deceit
!
 
<EOS>
I
have
as
good
as
confessed
<EOS>
I
love
him
;
but
,
indeed
,
it
was
on
supposing
him
good
.
 
<EOS>
This
,
however
,
has
given
him
too
much
advantage
.
<EOS>
But
now
I
will
break
this
wicked
forward
heart
of
mine
,
if
it
will
not
be
taught
to
hate
him
!
 
<EOS>
O
,
what
a
black
dismal
heart
must
he
have
!
 
<EOS>
So
here
is
a
plot
to
ruin
me
,
and
by
my
own
consent
to
!
 
<EOS>
No
wonder
he
did
not
improve
his
wicked
opportunities
,
(
which
I
thought
owing
to
remorse
for
his
sin
,
and
compassion
for
me
,
)
when
he
had
such
a
project
as
this
in
reserve
!
 
<EOS>
Here
should
I
have
been
deluded
with
the
hopes
of
a
happiness
that
my
highest
ambition
could
have
had
aspired
to
!
 
<EOS>
But
how
dreadful
must
have
been
my
lot
,
when
I
had
found
myself
an
undone
creature
,
and
a
guilty
harlot
,
instead
of
a
lawful
wife
!
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
this
is
indeed
too
much
,
too
much
,
for
your
poor
Pamela
to
support
!
 
<EOS>
This
is
the
worse
,
as
I
hoped
all
the
worst
was
over
;
and
that
I
had
the
pleasure
of
beholding
a
reclaimed
man
,
and
not
an
abandoned
libertine
.
 
<EOS>
What
now
must
your
poor
daughter
do
?
 
<EOS>
Now
all
her
hopes
are
dashed
!
 
<EOS>
And
if
this
fails
him
,
then
comes
,
to
be
sure
,
my
forced
disgrace
!
<EOS>
for
this
shews
he
will
never
leave
till
he
has
ruined
me
 
<EOS>
O
,
the
wretched
,
wretched
Pamela
!
  
<EOS>
Saturday
noon
,
one
o'clock
.
  
<EOS>
My
master
is
come
home
;
and
,
to
be
sure
,
has
been
where
he
said
.
 
<EOS>
So
once
he
has
told
truth
;
and
this
matter
seems
to
be
gone
off
without
a
plot
<EOS>
:
No
doubt
he
depends
upon
his
sham
wicked
marriage
!
 
<EOS>
He
has
brought
a
gentleman
with
him
to
dinner
;
and
so
I
have
not
seen
him
yet
.
  
<EOS>
Two
o'clock
.
  
<EOS>
I
am
very
sorrowful
,
and
still
have
greater
reason
;
for
,
just
now
,
as
I
was
in
my
closet
,
opening
the
parcel
I
had
hid
under
the
rose
-
bush
,
to
see
if
it
was
damaged
by
lying
so
long
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
came
upon
me
by
surprise
,
and
laid
her
hands
upon
it
;
for
she
had
been
looking
through
the
key
-
hole
,
it
seems
.
  
<EOS>
I
know
not
what
I
shall
do
!
 
<EOS>
For
now
he
will
see
all
my
private
thoughts
of
him
,
and
all
my
secrets
,
as
I
may
say
.
 
<EOS>
What
a
careless
creature
I
am
!
 
<EOS>
To
be
sure
I
deserve
to
be
punished
.
  
<EOS>
You
know
I
had
the
good
luck
,
by
Mr.
Williams
's
means
,
to
send
you
all
my
papers
down
to
Sunday
night
,
the
17th
day
of
my
imprisonment
.
 
<EOS>
But
now
these
papers
contain
all
my
matters
from
that
time
,
to
Wednesday
the
27th
day
of
my
distress
:
<EOS>
And
which
,
as
you
may
now
,
perhaps
,
never
see
,
I
will
briefly
mention
the
contents
to
you
.
  
<EOS>
In
these
papers
,
then
,
are
included
,
"
An
account
of
Mrs.
Jewkes
's
arts
to
draw
me
in
to
approve
of
Mr.
Williams
's
proposal
for
marriage
;
and
my
refusing
to
do
so
;
and
desiring
you
not
to
encourage
his
suit
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Williams
's
being
wickedly
robbed
,
and
a
visit
of
hers
to
him
;
whereby
she
discovered
all
his
secrets
.
 
<EOS>
How
I
was
inclined
to
get
off
,
while
she
was
gone
;
but
was
ridiculously
prevented
by
my
foolish
fears
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
My
having
the
key
of
the
back
-
door
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
's
writing
to
my
master
all
the
secrets
she
had
discovered
of
Mr.
Williams
,
and
her
behaviour
to
me
and
him
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
Continuance
of
my
correspondence
with
Mr.
Williams
by
the
tiles
;
begun
in
the
parcel
you
had
.
 
<EOS>
My
reproaches
to
him
for
his
revealing
himself
to
Mrs.
Jewkes
;
and
his
letter
to
me
in
answer
,
<EOS>
threatening
to
expose
my
master
,
if
he
deceived
him
;
mentioning
in
it
John
Arnold
's
correspondence
with
him
;
and
a
letter
which
John
sent
,
and
was
intercepted
,
as
it
seems
.
 
<EOS>
Of
the
correspondence
being
carried
on
by
a
friend
of
his
at
Gainsborough
.
 
<EOS>
Of
the
horse
he
was
to
provide
for
me
,
and
one
for
himself
.
 
<EOS>
Of
what
Mr.
Williams
had
owned
to
Mrs.
Jewkes
;
and
of
my
discouraging
his
proposals
.
 
<EOS>
Then
it
contained
a
pressing
letter
of
mine
to
him
,
urging
my
escape
before
my
master
came
;
with
his
half
-
angry
answer
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
Your
good
letter
to
me
,
my
dear
father
,
sent
to
me
by
Mr.
Williams
's
conveyance
;
in
which
you
would
have
me
encourage
Mr.
Williams
,
but
leave
it
to
me
;
and
in
which
,
fortunately
enough
,
you
take
notice
of
my
being
uninclined
to
marry
.
 
<EOS>
My
earnest
desire
to
be
with
you
.
 
<EOS>
The
substance
of
my
answer
to
Mr.
Williams
,
expressing
more
patience
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
A
dreadful
letter
of
my
master
to
Mrs.
Jewkes
;
which
,
by
mistake
,
was
directed
to
me
;
and
one
to
me
,
directed
by
like
mistake
to
her
;
and
very
free
reflections
of
mine
upon
both
.
 
<EOS>
The
concern
I
expressed
for
Mr.
Williams
's
being
taken
in
,
deceived
,
and
ruined
.
 
<EOS>
An
account
of
Mrs.
Jewkes
's
glorying
in
her
wicked
fidelity
.
 
<EOS>
A
sad
description
I
gave
of
Monsieur
Colbrand
,
a
person
he
sent
down
to
assist
Mrs.
Jewkes
in
watching
me
.
 
<EOS>
How
Mr.
Williams
was
arrested
,
and
thrown
into
gaol
;
and
the
concern
I
expressed
upon
it
;
and
my
free
reflections
on
my
master
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
A
projected
contrivance
of
mine
,
to
get
away
out
of
the
window
,
and
by
the
back
-
door
;
and
throwing
by
petticoat
and
handkerchief
into
the
pond
to
amuse
them
,
while
I
got
off
:
An
attempt
that
had
like
to
have
ended
very
dreadfully
for
me
!
 
<EOS>
My
further
concern
for
Mr.
Williams
's
ruin
,
on
my
account
:
<EOS>
And
,
lastly
,
my
over
-
hearing
Mrs.
Jewkes
brag
of
her
contrivance
to
rob
Mr.
Williams
,
in
order
to
get
at
my
papers
;
which
,
however
,
he
preserved
,
and
sent
safe
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
These
,
down
to
the
execution
of
my
unfortunate
plot
to
escape
,
are
,
to
the
best
of
my
remembrance
,
the
contents
of
the
papers
,
which
this
merciless
woman
seized
:
<EOS>
For
,
how
badly
I
came
off
,
and
what
followed
,
I
still
have
safe
,
as
I
hope
,
sewed
in
my
under
-
coat
,
about
my
hips
.
  
<EOS>
In
vain
were
all
my
prayers
and
tears
to
her
,
to
get
her
not
to
shew
them
to
my
master
.
 
<EOS>
For
she
said
,
It
had
now
come
out
<EOS>
,
why
I
affected
to
be
so
much
alone
;
and
why
I
was
always
writing
.
 
<EOS>
And
she
thought
herself
happy
<EOS>
,
she
said
,
she
had
found
these
;
for
often
and
often
had
she
searched
every
place
she
could
think
of
,
for
writings
,
to
no
purpose
before
.
 
<EOS>
And
she
hoped
,
she
said
,
there
was
nothing
in
them
by
what
any
body
might
see
;
for
,
said
she
,
you
know
you
are
all
innocence
!
 
<EOS>
Insolent
creature
!
<EOS>
said
I
,
I
am
sure
you
are
all
guilt
!
 
<EOS>
And
so
you
must
do
your
worst
;
for
now
I
ca
n't
help
myself
,
and
I
see
there
is
no
mercy
to
be
expected
from
you
.
  
<EOS>
Just
now
,
my
master
being
come
up
,
she
went
to
him
upon
the
stairs
,
and
gave
him
my
papers
.
 
<EOS>
There
,
sir
,
said
she
;
you
always
said
Mrs.
Pamela
was
a
great
writer
;
but
I
never
could
get
at
any
thing
of
hers
before
.
<EOS>
He
took
them
;
and
,
without
coming
to
me
,
went
down
to
the
parlour
again
.
<EOS>
And
what
with
the
gipsy
affair
,
and
what
with
this
,
I
could
not
think
of
going
down
to
dinner
;
and
she
told
him
that
too
;
and
so
I
suppose
I
shall
have
him
up
stairs
,
as
soon
as
his
company
is
gone
.
  
<EOS>
Saturday
,
six
o'clock
.
  
<EOS>
My
master
came
up
,
and
,
in
a
pleasanter
manner
than
I
expected
,
said
,
So
,
Pamela
,
we
have
seized
,
it
seems
,
your
treasonable
papers
?
 
<EOS>
Treasonable
!
<EOS>
said
I
,
very
sullenly
.
 
<EOS>
Ay
,
said
he
,
I
suppose
so
;
for
you
are
a
great
plotter
:
but
I
have
not
read
them
yet
.
  
<EOS>
Then
,
sir
,
said
I
,
very
gravely
,
it
will
be
truly
honourable
in
you
not
to
read
them
;
but
to
give
them
to
me
again
.
 
<EOS>
To
whom
,
says
he
,
are
they
written
?
 
<EOS>
To
my
father
,
sir
;
<EOS>
but
I
suppose
you
see
to
whom
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
returned
he
,
I
have
not
read
three
lines
yet
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
pray
,
sir
,
do
n't
read
them
;
but
give
them
to
me
again
.
 
<EOS>
That
I
will
not
,
said
he
,
till
I
have
read
them
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
said
I
,
you
served
me
not
well
in
the
letters
I
used
to
write
formerly
:
I
think
it
was
not
worthy
your
character
to
contrive
to
get
them
in
your
hands
,
by
that
false
John
Arnold
!
<EOS>
for
should
such
a
gentleman
as
you
mind
what
your
poor
servant
writes
?
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
said
he
,
by
all
means
,
mind
what
such
a
servant
as
my
Pamela
writes
.
  
<EOS>
Your
Pamela
!
<EOS>
thought
I.
 
<EOS>
Then
the
sham
marriage
came
into
my
head
;
and
indeed
it
has
not
been
out
of
it
,
since
the
gipsy
affair
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
said
he
,
have
you
any
thing
in
these
papers
you
would
not
have
me
see
?
 
<EOS>
To
be
sure
,
sir
,
said
I
,
there
is
;
for
what
one
writes
to
one
's
father
and
mother
,
is
not
for
every
body
to
see
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
,
said
he
,
am
I
every
body
.
  
<EOS>
Those
letters
,
added
he
,
that
I
did
see
by
John
's
means
,
were
not
to
your
disadvantage
<EOS>
,
I
'll
assure
you
;
for
they
gave
me
a
very
high
opinion
of
your
wit
and
innocence
:
<EOS>
And
if
I
had
not
loved
you
,
do
you
think
I
would
have
troubled
myself
about
your
letters
?
  
<EOS>
Alas
!
<EOS>
sir
,
said
I
,
great
pride
to
me
that
!
 
<EOS>
For
they
gave
you
such
an
opinion
of
my
innocence
,
that
you
was
resolved
to
ruin
me
.
 
<EOS>
And
what
advantage
have
they
brought
me
!
 
<EOS>
Who
have
been
made
a
prisoner
,
and
used
as
I
have
been
between
you
and
your
housekeeper
.
  
<EOS>
Why
,
Pamela
,
said
he
,
a
little
seriously
,
why
this
behaviour
,
for
my
goodness
to
you
in
the
garden
?
 
<EOS>
This
is
not
of
a
piece
with
your
conduct
and
softness
there
,
that
quite
charmed
me
in
your
favour
:
<EOS>
And
you
must
not
give
me
cause
to
think
that
you
will
be
the
more
insolent
,
as
you
find
me
kinder
.
 
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
sir
,
said
I
,
you
know
best
your
own
heart
and
designs
!
 
<EOS>
But
I
fear
I
was
too
open
-
hearted
then
;
and
that
you
still
keep
your
resolution
to
undo
me
,
and
have
only
changed
the
form
of
your
proceedings
.
  
<EOS>
When
I
tell
you
once
again
,
said
he
,
a
little
sternly
,
that
you
can
not
oblige
me
more
,
than
by
placing
some
confidence
in
me
<EOS>
,
I
will
let
you
know
,
that
these
foolish
and
perverse
doubts
are
the
worst
things
you
can
be
guilty
of
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
said
he
,
I
shall
possibly
account
for
the
cause
of
them
,
in
these
papers
of
yours
;
for
I
doubt
not
you
have
been
sincere
to
your
father
and
mother
,
though
you
begin
to
make
me
suspect
you
:
<EOS>
For
I
tell
you
,
perverse
girl
,
that
it
is
impossible
you
should
be
thus
cold
and
insensible
,
after
what
has
passed
in
the
garden
,
if
you
were
not
prepossessed
in
some
other
person
's
favour
:
And
let
me
add
,
that
if
I
find
it
so
,
it
shall
be
attended
with
such
effects
,
as
will
make
every
vein
in
your
heart
bleed
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
going
away
in
wrath
;
and
I
said
,
One
word
,
good
sir
,
one
word
before
you
read
them
,
since
you
will
read
them
:
Pray
make
allowances
 
for
all
the
harsh
reflections
that
you
will
find
in
them
,
on
your
own
conduct
to
me
:
And
remember
only
,
that
they
were
not
written
for
your
sight
;
and
were
penned
by
a
poor
creature
hardly
used
,
and
who
was
in
constant
apprehension
of
receiving
from
you
the
worst
treatment
that
you
could
inflict
upon
her
.
  
<EOS>
If
that
be
all
,
said
he
,
and
there
be
nothing
of
another
nature
,
that
I
can
not
forgive
,
you
have
no
cause
for
uneasiness
;
for
I
had
as
many
instances
of
your
saucy
reflections
upon
me
in
your
former
letters
,
as
there
were
lines
;
and
<EOS>
yet
,
you
see
,
I
have
never
upbraided
you
on
that
score
;
though
,
perhaps
,
I
wished
you
had
been
more
sparing
of
your
epithets
,
and
your
freedoms
of
that
sort
.
  
<EOS>
Well
,
sir
,
said
I
,
since
you
will
,
you
must
read
them
;
and
I
think
I
have
no
reason
to
be
afraid
of
being
found
insincere
,
or
having
,
in
any
respect
,
told
you
a
falsehood
;
because
,
though
I
do
n't
remember
all
I
wrote
,
yet
<EOS>
I
know
I
wrote
my
heart
;
and
that
is
not
deceitful
.
 
<EOS>
And
remember
,
sir
,
another
thing
,
that
I
always
declared
I
thought
myself
right
to
endeavour
to
make
my
escape
from
this
forced
and
illegal
restraint
;
and
so
you
must
not
be
angry
that
I
would
have
done
so
,
if
I
could
.
  
<EOS>
I
'll
judge
you
,
never
fear
,
said
he
,
as
favourably
as
you
deserve
;
for
you
have
too
powerful
a
pleader
within
me
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
went
down
stairs
.
  
<EOS>
About
nine
o'clock
he
sent
for
me
down
into
the
parlour
.
 
<EOS>
I
went
a
little
fearfully
;
and
he
held
the
paper
in
his
hand
,
and
said
,
Now
,
Pamela
,
you
come
upon
your
trial
.
 
<EOS>
Said
I
<EOS>
,
I
hope
I
have
a
just
judge
to
hear
my
cause
.
 
<EOS>
Ay
,
said
he
,
and
you
may
hope
for
a
merciful
one
too
,
or
else
I
know
not
what
will
become
of
you
.
  
<EOS>
I
expect
,
continued
he
,
that
you
will
answer
me
directly
,
and
plainly
,
to
every
question
I
shall
ask
you
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
first
place
,
here
are
several
love
-
letters
between
you
and
Williams
.
 
<EOS>
Love
-
letters
!
<EOS>
sir
,
said
I.
 
Well
,
call
them
what
you
will
,
said
he
<EOS>
,
I
do
n't
entirely
like
them
,
I
'll
assure
you
,
with
all
the
allowances
you
desired
me
to
make
for
you
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
find
,
sir
,
said
I
,
that
I
encouraged
his
proposal
,
or
do
you
not
?
 
<EOS>
Why
,
said
he
,
you
discourage
his
address
in
appearance
;
but
no
otherwise
than
all
your
cunning
sex
do
to
ours
,
to
make
us
more
eager
in
pursuing
you
.
  
<EOS>
Well
,
sir
,
said
I
,
that
is
your
comment
;
but
it
does
not
appear
so
in
the
text
.
 
<EOS>
Smartly
said
!
<EOS>
says
he
:
<EOS>
Where
a
d####l
gottest
thou
,
at
these
years
,
all
this
knowledge
?
 
<EOS>
And
then
thou
hast
a
memory
,
as
I
see
by
your
papers
,
that
nothing
escapes
.
 
<EOS>
Alas
!
<EOS>
sir
,
said
I
,
what
poor
abilities
I
have
,
serve
only
to
make
me
more
miserable
!
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
pleasure
in
my
memory
,
which
impresses
things
upon
me
,
that
I
could
be
glad
never
were
,
or
everlastingly
to
forget
.
  
<EOS>
Well
,
said
he
,
so
much
for
that
 
<EOS>
But
where
are
the
accounts
(
since
you
have
kept
so
exact
a
journal
of
all
that
has
befallen
you
)
previous
to
these
here
in
my
hand
?
 
<EOS>
My
father
has
them
,
sir
,
said
I.
 
<EOS>
By
whose
means
?
<EOS>
said
he
 
<EOS>
By
Mr.
Williams
's
,
said
<EOS>
I.
 
Well
answered
,
said
he
.
 
<EOS>
But
can
not
you
contrive
to
get
me
a
sight
of
them
?
 
<EOS>
That
would
be
pretty
!
<EOS>
said
<EOS>
I.
 
I
wish
I
could
have
contrived
to
have
kept
those
you
have
from
your
sight
.
<EOS>
Said
he
,
I
must
see
them
,
Pamela
,
or
<EOS>
I
shall
never
be
easy
;
for
I
must
know
how
this
correspondence
between
you
and
Williams
began
:
and
if
I
can
see
them
,
it
shall
be
better
for
you
,
if
they
answer
what
these
give
me
hope
they
will
.
  
<EOS>
I
can
tell
you
,
sir
,
very
faithfully
,
said
I
,
what
the
beginning
was
;
for
I
was
bold
enough
to
be
the
beginner
.
 
<EOS>
That
wo
n't
do
,
said
he
;
for
though
this
may
appear
a
punctilio
to
you
,
to
me
it
is
of
high
importance
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
said
I
,
if
you
please
to
let
me
go
to
my
father
,
I
will
send
them
to
you
by
any
messenger
you
shall
send
for
them
.
 
<EOS>
Will
you
so
?
 
<EOS>
But
I
dare
say
,
if
you
will
write
for
them
,
they
will
send
them
to
you
,
without
the
trouble
of
such
a
journey
to
yourself
:
and
I
beg
you
will
.
  
<EOS>
I
think
,
sir
,
said
I
,
as
you
have
seen
all
my
former
letters
through
John
's
baseness
,
and
now
these
,
through
your
faithful
housekeeper
's
officious
watchfulness
,
you
might
see
all
the
rest
:
<EOS>
But
I
hope
you
will
not
desire
it
,
till
I
can
see
how
much
my
pleasing
you
in
this
particular
will
be
of
use
to
myself
.
  
<EOS>
You
must
trust
to
my
honour
for
that
.
 
<EOS>
But
tell
me
,
Pamela
,
said
the
sly
gentleman
,
since
I
have
seen
these
,
would
you
have
voluntarily
shewn
me
those
,
had
they
been
in
your
possession
?
  
<EOS>
I
was
not
aware
of
this
inference
,
and
said
,
Yes
,
truly
,
<EOS>
sir
,
I
think
I
should
,
if
you
commanded
it
.
 
<EOS>
Well
then
,
Pamela
,
said
he
,
as
I
am
sure
you
have
found
means
to
continue
your
journal
,
I
desire
,
till
the
former
part
can
come
,
that
you
will
shew
me
the
succeeding
.
 
<EOS>
O
sir
,
sir
,
said
I
,
have
you
caught
me
so
?
 
<EOS>
But
indeed
you
must
excuse
me
there
.
  
<EOS>
Why
,
said
he
,
tell
me
truly
,
have
you
not
continued
your
account
till
now
?
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
ask
me
,
sir
,
said
I.
 
<EOS>
But
I
insist
upon
your
answer
,
replied
he
.
 
<EOS>
Why
then
,
sir
,
I
will
not
tell
an
untruth
;
I
have
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
my
good
girl
!
<EOS>
said
he
,
I
love
sincerity
at
my
heart
.
 
<EOS>
In
another
,
sir
,
said
I
,
I
presume
you
mean
!
 
<EOS>
Well
,
said
he
,
I
'll
allow
you
to
be
a
little
witty
upon
me
;
because
it
is
in
you
,
and
you
can
not
help
it
:
but
you
will
greatly
oblige
me
,
to
shew
me
voluntarily
what
you
have
written
.
 
<EOS>
I
long
to
see
the
particulars
of
your
plot
,
and
your
disappointment
,
where
your
papers
leave
off
:
for
you
have
so
beautiful
a
manner
,
that
it
is
partly
that
,
and
partly
my
love
for
you
,
that
has
made
me
desirous
of
reading
all
you
write
;
<EOS>
though
a
great
deal
of
it
is
against
myself
;
for
which
you
must
expect
to
suffer
a
little
:
<EOS>
and
as
I
have
furnished
you
with
the
subject
,
I
have
a
title
to
see
the
fruits
of
your
pen
.
 
<EOS>
Besides
,
said
he
,
there
is
such
a
pretty
air
of
romance
,
as
you
relate
them
,
in
your
plots
,
and
my
plots
,
that
I
shall
be
better
directed
in
what
manner
to
wind
up
the
catastrophe
of
the
pretty
novel
.
  
<EOS>
If
I
was
your
equal
,
sir
,
said
I
,
I
should
say
this
is
a
very
provoking
way
of
jeering
at
the
misfortunes
you
have
brought
upon
me
.
  
<EOS>
O
,
said
he
,
the
liberties
you
have
taken
with
my
character
in
your
letters
,
sets
us
upon
a
par
,
at
least
in
that
respect
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
I
could
not
have
taken
those
liberties
,
if
you
had
not
given
me
the
cause
:
and
the
cause
,
sir
,
you
know
,
is
before
the
effect
.
  
<EOS>
True
,
Pamela
,
said
he
;
you
chop
logic
very
prettily
.
 
<EOS>
What
the
deuse
do
we
men
go
to
school
for
?
 
<EOS>
If
our
wits
were
equal
to
women
's
,
we
might
spare
much
time
and
pains
in
our
education
:
for
nature
teaches
your
sex
,
what
,
in
a
long
course
of
labour
and
study
,
ours
can
hardly
attain
to
.
  
<EOS>
But
,
indeed
,
every
lady
is
not
a
Pamela
.
  
<EOS>
You
delight
to
banter
your
poor
servant
,
said
I.
  
Nay
<EOS>
,
continued
he
,
I
believe
I
must
assume
to
myself
half
the
merit
of
your
wit
,
too
;
for
the
innocent
exercises
you
have
had
for
it
,
from
me
,
have
certainly
sharpened
your
invention
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
,
said
I
,
could
I
have
been
without
those
innocent
exercises
,
as
you
are
pleased
to
call
them
<EOS>
,
I
should
have
been
glad
to
have
been
as
dull
as
a
beetle
.
 
<EOS>
But
then
,
Pamela
,
said
he
,
I
should
not
have
loved
you
so
well
.
 
<EOS>
But
then
,
sir
,
I
should
have
been
safe
,
easy
,
and
happy
.
 
<EOS>
Ay
,
may
be
so
,
and
may
be
not
;
and
the
wife
,
too
,
of
some
clouterly
plough
-
boy
.
  
<EOS>
But
then
,
sir
,
I
should
have
been
content
and
innocent
;
and
that
's
better
than
being
a
princess
,
and
not
so
.
 
<EOS>
And
may
be
not
,
said
he
;
<EOS>
for
if
you
had
had
that
pretty
face
,
some
of
us
keen
fox
-
hunters
should
have
found
you
out
;
and
,
in
spite
of
your
romantic
notions
,
(
which
then
,
too
,
perhaps
,
would
not
have
had
so
strong
a
place
in
your
mind
,
)
might
have
been
more
happy
with
the
ploughman
's
wife
,
than
I
have
been
with
my
mother
's
Pamela
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
,
sir
,
said
I
,
God
would
have
given
me
more
grace
.
  
<EOS>
Well
,
but
,
resumed
he
,
as
to
these
writings
of
yours
,
that
follow
your
fine
plot
,
I
must
see
them
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
sir
,
you
must
not
,
if
I
can
help
it
.
<EOS>
Nothing
,
said
he
,
pleases
me
better
,
than
that
,
in
all
your
arts
,
shifts
,
and
stratagems
,
you
have
had
a
great
regard
to
truth
;
and
have
,
in
all
your
little
pieces
of
deceit
,
told
very
few
wilful
fibs
.
 
<EOS>
Now
I
expect
you
'll
continue
this
laudable
rule
in
your
conversation
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
Let
me
know
then
,
where
you
have
found
supplies
of
pen
,
ink
,
and
paper
,
when
Mrs.
Jewkes
was
so
vigilant
,
and
gave
you
but
two
sheets
at
a
time
?
 
<EOS>
Tell
me
truth
.
  
<EOS>
Why
,
sir
,
little
did
I
think
I
should
have
such
occasion
for
them
;
but
,
when
I
went
away
from
your
house
,
I
begged
some
of
each
of
good
Mr.
Longman
,
who
gave
me
plenty
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
yes
,
said
he
,
it
must
be
good
Mr.
Longman
!
 
<EOS>
All
your
confederates
are
good
,
every
one
of
them
:
but
such
of
my
servants
as
have
done
their
duty
,
and
obeyed
my
orders
,
are
painted
out
by
you
as
black
as
devils
!
<EOS>
nay
,
so
am
I
too
,
for
that
matter
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
,
said
I
,
I
hope
you
wo
n't
be
angry
,
but
,
saving
yourself
,
do
you
think
they
are
painted
worse
than
they
deserve
?
<EOS>
or
worse
than
the
parts
they
acted
require
?
  
<EOS>
You
say
,
saving
myself
,
Pamela
;
but
is
not
that
saying
a
mere
compliment
to
me
,
because
I
am
present
,
and
you
are
in
my
hands
?
 
<EOS>
Tell
me
truly
.
  
<EOS>
Good
sir
,
excuse
me
;
but
I
fancy
<EOS>
I
might
ask
you
,
Why
you
should
think
so
,
if
there
was
not
a
little
bit
of
conscience
that
told
you
,
there
was
but
too
much
reason
for
it
?
  
<EOS>
He
kissed
me
,
and
said
,
I
must
either
do
thus
,
or
be
angry
with
you
;
for
you
are
very
saucy
,
Pamela
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
with
your
bewitching
chit
-
chat
,
and
pretty
impertinence
,
I
will
not
lose
my
question
.
 
<EOS>
Where
did
you
hide
your
paper
,
pens
,
and
ink
?
  
<EOS>
Some
,
sir
,
in
one
place
,
some
in
another
;
that
I
might
have
some
left
,
if
others
should
be
found
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
a
good
girl
!
<EOS>
said
he
<EOS>
;
I
love
you
for
your
sweet
veracity
.
 
<EOS>
Now
tell
me
where
it
is
you
hide
your
written
papers
,
your
saucy
journal
?
 
<EOS>
I
must
beg
your
excuse
for
that
,
sir
,
said
I.
 
But
indeed
,
answered
he
,
you
will
not
have
it
:
for
I
will
know
,
and
I
will
see
them
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
very
hard
,
sir
,
said
I
;
but
I
must
say
,
you
shall
not
,
if
I
can
help
it
.
  
<EOS>
We
were
standing
most
of
this
time
;
but
he
then
sat
down
,
and
took
me
by
both
my
hands
,
and
said
,
<EOS>
Well
said
,
my
pretty
Pamela
,
if
you
can
help
it
!
<EOS>
But
I
will
not
let
you
help
it
.
 
<EOS>
Tell
me
,
are
they
in
your
pocket
?
 
<EOS>
No
,
sir
,
said
I
;
my
heart
up
at
my
mouth
.
 
<EOS>
Said
he
<EOS>
,
I
know
you
wo
n't
tell
a
downright
fib
for
the
world
:
<EOS>
but
for
equivocation
!
<EOS>
no
jesuit
ever
went
beyond
you
.
 
<EOS>
Answer
me
then
,
Are
they
in
neither
of
your
pockets
?
 
<EOS>
No
,
sir
,
said
I.
 
Are
they
not
<EOS>
,
said
he
,
about
your
stays
?
 
<EOS>
No
,
sir
,
replied
I
:
But
pray
no
more
questions
:
for
ask
me
ever
so
much
,
I
will
not
tell
you
.
  
<EOS>
O
,
said
he
,
I
have
a
way
for
that
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
do
as
they
do
abroad
,
when
the
criminals
wo
n't
confess
;
torture
them
till
they
do
.
 
<EOS>
But
pray
,
sir
,
said
I
,
is
this
fair
,
just
,
or
honest
?
 
<EOS>
I
am
no
criminal
;
and
I
wo
n't
confess
.
  
<EOS>
O
,
my
girl
!
<EOS>
said
he
,
many
an
innocent
person
has
been
put
to
the
torture
.
<EOS>
But
let
me
know
where
they
are
,
and
you
shall
escape
the
question
,
as
they
call
it
abroad
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
,
said
I
,
the
torture
is
not
used
in
England
,
and
I
hope
you
wo
n't
bring
it
up
.
 
<EOS>
Admirably
said
!
<EOS>
said
the
naughty
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
can
tell
you
of
as
good
a
punishment
.
 
<EOS>
If
a
criminal
wo
n't
plead
with
us
,
here
in
England
,
we
press
him
to
death
,
or
till
he
does
plead
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
now
,
Pamela
,
that
is
a
punishment
shall
certainly
be
yours
,
if
you
wo
n't
tell
without
.
  
<EOS>
Tears
stood
in
my
eyes
,
and
I
said
,
This
,
sir
,
is
very
cruel
and
barbarous
.
 
<EOS>
No
matter
,
said
he
;
it
is
but
like
your
Lucifer
,
you
know
,
in
my
shape
!
 
<EOS>
And
,
after
I
have
done
so
many
heinous
things
by
you
as
you
think
,
you
have
no
great
reason
to
judge
so
hardly
of
this
;
or
,
at
least
,
it
is
<EOS>
but
of
a
piece
with
the
rest
.
  
<EOS>
But
,
sir
,
said
I
,
(
dreadfully
afraid
he
had
some
notion
they
were
about
me
,
)
if
you
will
be
obeyed
in
this
unreasonable
manner
,
though
it
is
sad
tyranny
,
to
be
sure
!
 
<EOS>
let
me
go
up
to
them
,
and
read
them
over
again
,
and
you
shall
see
so
far
as
to
the
end
of
the
sad
story
that
follows
those
you
have
.
  
<EOS>
I
'll
see
them
all
,
said
he
,
down
to
this
time
,
if
you
have
written
so
far
:
 
Or
,
at
least
,
till
within
this
week
.
 
<EOS>
Then
let
me
go
up
to
them
,
said
I
,
and
see
what
I
have
written
,
and
to
what
day
,
to
shew
them
to
you
;
for
you
wo
n't
desire
to
see
every
thing
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
will
,
replied
he
.
  
<EOS>
But
say
,
Pamela
,
tell
me
truth
:
Are
they
above
?
 
<EOS>
I
was
much
affrighted
.
<EOS>
He
saw
my
confusion
.
 
<EOS>
Tell
me
truth
,
said
he
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
sir
,
answered
I
,
I
have
sometimes
hid
them
under
the
dry
mould
in
the
garden
;
sometimes
in
one
place
,
sometimes
in
another
;
and
those
you
have
in
your
hand
,
were
several
days
under
a
rose
-
bush
,
in
the
garden
.
 
<EOS>
Artful
slut
!
<EOS>
said
he
,
<EOS>
What
's
this
to
my
question
?
 
<EOS>
Are
they
not
about
you
?
 
<EOS>
If
,
said
I
,
I
must
pluck
them
out
of
my
hiding
-
place
behind
the
wainscot
,
wo
n't
you
see
me
?
  
<EOS>
S
till
more
and
more
artful
!
<EOS>
said
he
 
<EOS>
Is
this
an
answer
to
my
question
?
  
<EOS>
I
 
have
searched
every
place
above
,
and
in
your
closet
,
for
them
,
and
can
not
find
them
;
so
I
will
know
where
they
are
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
said
he
,
it
is
my
opinion
<EOS>
they
are
about
you
;
and
I
never
undressed
a
girl
in
my
life
;
but
I
will
now
begin
to
strip
my
pretty
Pamela
;
and
I
hope
I
shall
not
go
far
before
I
find
them
.
  
<EOS>
I
fell
a
crying
,
and
said
,
I
will
not
be
used
in
this
manner
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
,
sir
,
said
I
,
(
for
he
began
to
unpin
my
handkerchief
,
)
consider
!
 
<EOS>
Pray
sir
,
do
!
 
<EOS>
And
pray
,
said
he
,
do
you
consider
.
 
<EOS>
For
I
will
see
these
papers
.
<EOS>
But
may
be
,
said
he
,
they
are
tied
about
your
knees
,
with
your
garters
,
and
stooped
.
 
<EOS>
Was
ever
any
thing
so
vile
and
so
wicked
?
 
<EOS>
I
fell
on
my
knees
,
and
said
,
What
can
I
do
?
 
<EOS>
What
can
I
do
?
 
<EOS>
If
you
'll
let
me
go
up
<EOS>
I
'll
fetch
them
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
Will
you
,
said
he
,
on
your
honour
,
let
me
see
them
uncurtailed
,
and
not
offer
to
make
them
away
;
no
not
a
single
paper
?
 
<EOS>
I
will
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
On
your
honour
?
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
he
let
me
go
up
stairs
,
crying
sadly
for
vexation
to
be
so
used
.
 
<EOS>
Sure
nobody
was
ever
so
served
as
I
am
!
  
<EOS>
I
went
to
my
closet
,
and
there
I
sat
me
down
,
and
could
not
bear
the
thoughts
of
giving
up
my
papers
.
 
<EOS>
Besides
,
I
must
all
undress
me
,
in
a
manner
,
to
untack
them
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
writ
thus
:
  
"
SIR
,
  
"
To
expostulate
with
such
an
arbitrary
gentleman
,
I
know
will
signify
nothing
;
and
most
hardly
do
you
use
the
power
you
so
wickedly
have
got
over
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
heart
enough
,
<EOS>
sir
,
to
do
a
deed
that
would
make
you
regret
using
me
thus
;
and
I
can
hardly
bear
it
,
and
what
I
am
further
to
undergo
.
 
<EOS>
But
a
superior
consideration
withholds
me
;
thank
God
,
it
does
!
  
<EOS>
I
 
will
,
however
,
keep
my
word
,
if
you
insist
upon
it
when
you
have
read
this
;
but
,
sir
,
let
me
beg
of
you
to
give
me
time
till
to
-
morrow
morning
,
that
I
may
just
run
them
over
,
and
see
what
I
put
into
your
hands
against
me
:
and
I
will
then
give
my
papers
to
you
,
without
the
least
alteration
,
or
adding
or
diminishing
:
<EOS>
But
I
should
beg
still
to
be
excused
,
if
you
please
:
<EOS>
But
if
not
,
spare
them
to
me
but
till
to
-
morrow
morning
:
and
this
,
so
hardly
am
I
used
,
shall
be
thought
a
favour
,
which
I
shall
be
very
thankful
for
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
guessed
it
would
not
be
long
before
I
heard
from
him
<EOS>
and
he
accordingly
sent
up
Mrs.
Jewkes
for
what
I
had
promised
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
gave
her
this
note
to
carry
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
And
he
sent
word
,
that
I
must
keep
my
promise
,
and
he
would
give
me
till
morning
;
but
that
I
must
bring
them
to
him
,
without
his
asking
again
.
  
<EOS>
So
I
took
off
my
under
-
coat
,
and
with
great
trouble
of
mind
,
unsewed
them
from
it
.
 
<EOS>
And
there
is
a
vast
quantity
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
just
slightly
touch
upon
the
subjects
;
because
I
may
not
,
perhaps
,
get
them
again
for
you
to
see
.
  
<EOS>
They
begin
with
an
account
of
"
my
attempting
to
get
away
out
of
the
window
first
,
and
then
throwing
my
petticoat
and
handkerchief
into
the
pond
.
 
<EOS>
How
sadly
I
was
disappointed
,
the
lock
of
the
back
-
door
being
changed
.
 
<EOS>
How
,
in
trying
to
climb
over
the
door
,
I
tumbled
down
,
and
was
piteously
bruised
;
the
bricks
giving
way
,
and
tumbling
upon
me
.
 
<EOS>
How
,
finding
I
could
not
get
off
,
and
dreading
the
hard
usage
I
should
receive
,
I
was
so
wicked
as
to
think
of
throwing
myself
into
the
water
.
<EOS>
My
sad
reflections
upon
this
matter
.
 
<EOS>
How
Mrs.
Jewkes
used
me
upon
this
occasion
,
when
she
found
me
.
 
<EOS>
How
my
master
had
like
to
have
been
drowned
in
hunting
;
and
my
concern
for
his
danger
,
notwithstanding
his
usage
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
's
wicked
reports
,
to
frighten
me
,
that
I
was
to
be
married
to
the
ugly
Swiss
;
who
was
to
sell
me
on
the
wedding
-
day
to
my
master
.
 
<EOS>
Her
vile
way
of
talking
to
me
,
like
a
London
prostitute
.
 
<EOS>
My
apprehensions
of
seeing
preparations
made
for
my
master
's
coming
.
 
<EOS>
Her
causeless
fears
that
I
was
trying
to
get
away
again
,
when
I
had
no
thoughts
of
it
;
and
my
bad
usage
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
My
master
's
dreadful
arrival
;
and
his
hard
,
very
hard
treatment
of
me
;
and
Mrs.
Jewkes
's
insulting
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
His
jealousy
of
Mr.
Williams
and
me
.
 
<EOS>
How
Mrs.
Jewkes
vilely
instigated
him
to
wickedness
.
"
<EOS>
And
down
to
here
,
I
put
into
one
parcel
,
hoping
that
would
content
him
.
 
<EOS>
But
for
fear
it
should
not
<EOS>
,
I
put
into
another
parcel
the
following
;
viz
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
copy
of
his
proposals
to
me
,
of
a
great
parcel
of
gold
,
and
fine
clothes
and
rings
,
and
an
estate
of
I
ca
n't
tell
what
a
year
;
and
50l
.
<EOS>
a
year
for
the
life
of
both
you
,
my
dear
parents
,
to
be
his
mistress
;
with
an
insinuation
,
that
,
may
be
,
he
would
marry
me
at
the
year
's
end
:
<EOS>
All
sadly
vile
:
With
threatenings
,
if
I
did
not
comply
,
that
he
would
ruin
me
,
without
allowing
me
any
thing
.
 
<EOS>
A
copy
of
my
answer
,
refusing
all
,
with
just
abhorrence
:
<EOS>
But
begging
at
last
his
goodness
towards
me
,
and
mercy
on
me
,
in
the
most
moving
manner
I
could
think
of
.
 
<EOS>
An
account
of
his
angry
behaviour
,
and
Mrs.
Jewkes
's
wicked
advice
hereupon
.
 
<EOS>
His
trying
to
get
me
to
his
chamber
;
and
my
refusal
to
go
.
 
<EOS>
A
deal
of
stuff
and
chit
-
chat
between
me
and
the
odious
Mrs.
Jewkes
;
in
which
she
was
very
wicked
and
very
insulting
.
 
<EOS>
Two
notes
I
wrote
,
as
if
to
be
carried
to
church
,
to
pray
for
his
reclaiming
,
and
my
safety
;
which
Mrs.
Jewkes
seized
,
and
officiously
shewed
him
.
 
<EOS>
A
confession
of
mine
,
that
,
notwithstanding
his
bad
usage
,
I
could
not
hate
him
.
 
<EOS>
My
concern
for
Mr.
Williams
.
 
<EOS>
A
horrid
contrivance
of
my
master
's
to
ruin
me
;
being
in
my
room
,
disguised
in
clothes
of
the
maid
's
,
who
lay
with
me
and
Mrs.
Jewkes
.
 
<EOS>
How
narrowly
I
escaped
,
(
it
makes
my
heart
ache
to
think
of
it
still
!
)
<EOS>
by
falling
into
fits
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
's
detestable
part
in
this
sad
affair
.
 
<EOS>
How
he
seemed
moved
at
my
danger
,
and
forbore
his
abominable
designs
;
and
assured
me
he
had
offered
no
indecency
.
 
<EOS>
How
ill
I
was
for
a
day
or
two
after
;
and
how
kind
he
seemed
.
 
<EOS>
How
he
made
me
forgive
Mrs.
Jewkes
.
 
<EOS>
How
,
after
this
,
and
great
kindness
pretended
,
he
made
rude
offers
to
me
in
the
garden
,
which
I
escaped
.
 
<EOS>
How
I
resented
them
.
"
 
<EOS>
Then
I
had
written
,
"
How
kindly
he
behaved
himself
to
me
;
and
how
he
praised
me
,
and
gave
me
great
hopes
of
his
being
good
at
last
.
 
<EOS>
Of
the
too
tender
impression
this
made
upon
me
;
and
how
I
began
to
be
afraid
of
my
own
weakness
and
consideration
for
him
,
though
he
had
used
me
so
ill
.
 
<EOS>
How
sadly
jealous
he
was
of
Mr.
Williams
;
and
how
I
,
as
justly
could
,
cleared
myself
as
to
his
doubts
on
that
score
.
 
<EOS>
How
,
just
when
he
had
raised
me
up
to
the
highest
hope
of
his
goodness
,
he
dashed
me
sadly
again
,
and
went
off
more
coldly
.
 
<EOS>
My
free
reflections
upon
this
trying
occasion
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
brought
down
matters
from
Thursday
,
the
20th
day
of
my
imprisonment
,
to
Wednesday
the
41st
,
and
here
I
was
resolved
to
end
,
let
what
would
come
;
for
only
Thursday
,
Friday
,
and
Saturday
,
remain
to
give
an
account
of
;
and
Thursday
he
set
out
to
a
ball
at
Stamford
;
and
Friday
was
the
gipsy
story
;
and
this
is
Saturday
,
his
return
from
Stamford
.
 
<EOS>
And
truly
,
I
shall
have
but
<EOS>
little
heart
to
write
,
if
he
is
to
see
all
.
  
<EOS>
So
these
two
parcels
of
papers
I
have
got
ready
for
him
against
to
-
morrow
morning
.
 
<EOS>
To
be
sure
I
have
always
used
him
very
freely
in
my
writings
,
and
shewed
him
no
mercy
<EOS>
;
but
yet
he
must
thank
himself
for
it
;
for
I
have
only
writ
truth
;
and
I
wish
he
had
deserved
a
better
character
at
my
hands
,
as
well
for
his
own
sake
as
mine
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
though
I
do
n't
know
whether
ever
you
'll
see
what
I
write
,
I
must
say
,
that
I
will
go
to
bed
,
with
remembering
you
in
my
prayers
,
as
I
always
do
,
and
as
I
know
you
do
me
:
<EOS>
And
so
,
my
dear
parents
,
good
night
.
  
<EOS>
Sunday
morning
.
  
<EOS>
I
remembered
what
he
said
,
of
not
being
obliged
to
ask
again
for
my
papers
;
and
what
I
should
be
forced
to
do
,
and
could
not
help
,
I
thought
I
might
as
well
do
in
such
a
manner
as
might
shew
I
would
not
disoblige
on
purpose
:
though
I
stomached
this
matter
very
heavily
too
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
therefore
got
in
readiness
my
two
parcels
;
and
he
,
not
going
to
church
in
the
morning
,
bid
Mrs.
Jewkes
<EOS>
tell
me
he
was
gone
into
the
garden
.
  
<EOS>
I
knew
that
was
for
me
to
go
to
him
;
and
so
I
went
:
<EOS>
for
how
can
I
help
being
at
his
beck
?
<EOS>
which
grieves
me
not
a
little
,
though
he
is
my
master
,
as
I
may
say
;
for
I
am
so
wholly
in
his
power
,
that
it
would
do
me
no
good
to
incense
him
;
and
if
I
refused
to
obey
him
in
little
matters
,
my
refusal
in
greater
would
have
the
less
weight
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
went
down
to
the
garden
;
but
as
he
walked
in
one
walk
,
I
took
another
,
that
I
might
not
seem
too
forward
neither
.
  
<EOS>
He
soon
"
spied
me
,
and
said
,
Do
you
expect
to
be
courted
to
come
to
me
?
<EOS>
Sir
,
said
I
,
and
crossed
the
walk
to
attend
him
<EOS>
,
I
did
not
know
<EOS>
but
I
should
interrupt
you
in
your
meditations
this
good
day
.
  
<EOS>
Was
that
the
case
,
said
he
,
truly
,
and
from
your
heart
?
 
<EOS>
Why
,
sir
,
said
I
,
I
do
n't
doubt
<EOS>
but
you
have
very
good
thoughts
sometimes
,
though
not
towards
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
,
said
he
,
I
could
avoid
thinking
so
well
of
you
as
I
do
.
 
<EOS>
But
where
are
the
papers
?
 
<EOS>
I
dare
say
you
had
them
about
you
yesterday
;
for
you
say
in
those
I
have
,
that
you
will
bury
your
writings
in
the
garden
,
for
fear
you
should
be
searched
,
if
you
did
not
escape
.
<EOS>
This
,
added
he
,
gave
me
a
glorious
pretence
to
search
you
;
and
I
have
been
vexing
myself
all
night
,
that
I
did
not
strip
you
garment
by
garment
,
till
I
had
found
them
.
 
<EOS>
O
fie
,
sir
,
said
I
;
let
me
not
be
scared
,
with
hearing
that
you
had
such
a
thought
in
earnest
.
  
<EOS>
Well
,
said
he
<EOS>
,
I
hope
you
have
not
now
the
papers
to
give
me
;
for
I
had
rather
find
them
myself
,
I
'll
assure
you
.
  
<EOS>
I
did
not
like
this
way
of
talk
at
all
;
and
thinking
it
best
not
to
dwell
upon
it
,
said
,
Well
,
<EOS>
but
,
sir
,
you
will
excuse
me
,
I
hope
,
giving
up
my
papers
.
  
<EOS>
Do
n't
trifle
with
me
,
said
he
;
<EOS>
Where
are
they
?
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
was
very
good
to
you
last
night
,
to
humour
you
as
I
did
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
have
either
added
or
diminished
,
and
have
not
strictly
kept
your
promise
,
woe
be
to
you
!
<EOS>
Indeed
,
sir
,
said
I
,
I
have
neither
added
nor
diminished
.
 
<EOS>
But
there
is
the
parcel
that
goes
on
with
my
sad
attempt
to
escape
,
and
the
terrible
consequences
it
had
like
to
have
been
followed
with
.
 
<EOS>
And
it
goes
down
to
the
naughty
articles
you
sent
me
.
 
<EOS>
And
as
you
know
all
that
has
happened
since
,
I
hope
these
will
satisfy
you
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
going
to
speak
;
but
I
said
,
to
drive
him
from
thinking
of
any
more
,
<EOS>
And
I
must
beg
you
,
sir
,
to
read
the
matter
favourably
,
if
I
have
exceeded
in
any
liberties
of
my
pen
.
  
<EOS>
I
think
,
said
he
,
half
-
smiling
,
you
may
wonder
at
my
patience
,
that
I
can
be
so
easy
to
read
myself
abused
as
I
am
by
such
a
saucy
slut
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
said
I
,
I
have
wondered
you
should
be
so
desirous
to
see
my
bold
stuff
;
and
,
for
that
very
reason
,
I
have
thought
it
a
very
good
,
or
a
very
bad
sign
.
<EOS>
What
,
said
he
,
is
your
good
sign
?
 
<EOS>
That
it
may
have
an
effect
upon
your
temper
,
at
last
,
in
my
favour
,
when
you
see
me
so
sincere
.
 
<EOS>
Your
bad
sign
?
 
<EOS>
Why
,
that
if
you
can
read
my
reflections
and
observations
upon
your
treatment
of
me
,
with
tranquillity
,
and
not
be
moved
,
it
is
a
sign
of
a
very
cruel
and
determined
heart
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
pray
,
sir
,
do
n't
be
angry
at
my
boldness
in
telling
you
so
freely
my
thoughts
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
,
perhaps
,
said
he
,
be
least
mistaken
,
when
you
think
of
your
bad
sign
.
 
<EOS>
God
forbid
!
<EOS>
said
I.
  
<EOS>
So
I
took
out
my
papers
;
and
said
,
Here
,
sir
,
they
are
.
 
<EOS>
But
if
you
please
to
return
them
,
without
breaking
the
seal
,
it
will
be
very
generous
:
and
I
will
take
it
for
a
great
favour
,
and
a
good
omen
.
  
<EOS>
He
broke
the
seal
instantly
,
and
opened
them
:
So
much
for
your
omen
!
<EOS>
replied
he
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
sorry
for
it
,
said
I
,
very
seriously
;
and
was
walking
away
.
 
<EOS>
Whither
now
?
<EOS>
said
he
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
going
in
,
sir
,
that
you
might
have
time
to
read
them
,
if
you
thought
fit
.
 
<EOS>
He
put
them
into
his
pocket
,
and
said
,
You
have
more
than
these
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
sir
:
<EOS>
but
all
they
contain
,
you
know
as
well
as
I.
 
<EOS>
But
I
do
n't
know
,
said
he
,
the
light
you
put
things
in
;
and
so
give
them
me
,
if
you
have
not
a
mind
to
be
searched
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
,
said
I
,
I
ca
n't
stay
,
if
you
wo
n't
forbear
that
ugly
world
.
 
<EOS>
Give
me
then
no
reason
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
Where
are
the
other
papers
?
 
<EOS>
Why
,
then
,
unkind
sir
,
if
it
must
be
so
,
here
they
are
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
I
gave
him
,
out
of
my
pocket
,
the
second
parcel
,
sealed
up
,
as
the
former
,
with
this
superscription
;
From
the
naughty
articles
,
down
,
through
sad
attempts
,
to
Thursday
the
42d
day
of
my
imprisonment
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
last
Thursday
,
is
it
?
<EOS>
Yes
,
sir
;
but
now
you
will
see
what
I
write
,
I
will
find
some
other
way
to
employ
my
time
:
for
how
can
I
write
with
any
face
,
what
must
be
for
your
perusal
,
and
not
for
those
I
intended
to
read
my
melancholy
stories
?
  
<EOS>
Yes
,
said
he
,
I
would
have
you
continue
your
penmanship
by
all
means
;
and
,
I
assure
you
,
in
the
mind
I
am
in
,
I
will
not
ask
you
for
any
after
these
;
except
any
thing
very
extraordinary
occurs
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
have
another
thing
to
tell
you
,
added
he
,
that
if
you
send
for
those
from
your
father
,
and
let
me
read
them
,
I
may
,
very
probably
,
give
them
all
back
again
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
I
desire
you
will
do
it
.
  
<EOS>
This
a
little
encourages
me
to
continue
my
scribbling
;
but
,
for
fear
of
the
worst
,
I
will
,
when
they
come
to
any
bulk
,
contrive
some
way
to
hide
them
,
if
I
can
,
that
I
may
protest
I
have
them
not
about
me
,
which
,
before
,
I
could
not
say
of
a
truth
;
and
that
made
him
so
resolutely
bent
to
try
to
find
them
upon
me
;
for
which
I
might
have
suffered
frightful
indecencies
.
  
<EOS>
He
led
me
,
then
,
to
the
side
of
the
pond
;
and
sitting
down
on
the
slope
,
made
me
sit
by
him
.
 
<EOS>
Come
,
said
he
,
this
being
the
scene
of
part
of
your
project
,
and
where
you
so
artfully
threw
in
some
of
your
clothes
<EOS>
,
I
will
just
look
upon
that
part
of
your
relation
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
said
I
,
let
me
then
walk
about
,
at
a
little
distance
;
for
I
can
not
bear
the
thought
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
go
far
,
said
he
.
  
<EOS>
When
he
came
,
as
I
suppose
,
to
the
place
where
I
mentioned
the
bricks
falling
upon
me
,
he
got
up
,
and
walked
to
the
door
,
and
looked
upon
the
broken
part
of
the
wall
;
for
it
had
not
been
mended
;
and
came
back
,
reading
on
to
himself
,
towards
me
;
and
took
my
hand
,
and
put
it
under
his
arm
.
  
<EOS>
Why
,
this
,
said
he
,
my
girl
,
is
a
very
moving
tale
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
very
desperate
attempt
,
and
,
had
you
got
out
,
you
might
have
been
in
great
danger
;
for
you
had
a
very
bad
and
lonely
way
;
and
I
had
taken
such
measures
,
that
,
let
you
have
been
where
you
would
,
I
should
have
had
you
.
  
<EOS>
You
may
see
,
sir
,
said
I
,
what
I
ventured
,
rather
than
be
ruined
;
and
you
will
be
so
good
as
hence
to
judge
of
the
sincerity
of
my
profession
,
that
my
honesty
is
dearer
to
me
than
my
life
.
 
<EOS>
Romantic
girl
!
<EOS>
said
he
,
and
read
on
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
very
serious
at
my
reflections
,
on
what
God
had
enabled
me
to
escape
.
 
<EOS>
And
when
he
came
to
my
reasonings
about
throwing
myself
into
the
water
,
he
said
,
Walk
gently
before
;
and
seemed
so
moved
,
that
he
turned
away
his
face
from
me
;
and
I
blessed
this
good
sign
,
and
began
not
so
much
to
repent
at
his
seeing
this
mournful
part
of
my
story
.
  
<EOS>
He
put
the
papers
in
his
pocket
,
when
he
had
read
my
reflections
,
and
thanks
for
escaping
from
myself
;
and
said
,
taking
me
about
the
waist
,
O
my
dear
girl
!
<EOS>
you
have
touched
me
sensibly
with
your
mournful
relation
,
and
your
sweet
reflections
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
truly
have
been
very
miserable
had
it
taken
effect
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
you
have
been
used
too
roughly
;
and
it
is
a
mercy
you
stood
proof
in
that
fatal
moment
.
  
<EOS>
Then
he
most
kindly
folded
me
in
his
arms
:
<EOS>
Let
us
,
say
I
too
,
my
Pamela
,
walk
from
this
accursed
piece
of
water
;
for
I
shall
not
,
with
pleasure
,
look
upon
it
again
,
to
think
how
near
it
was
to
have
been
fatal
to
my
fair
one
.
 
<EOS>
I
thought
,
added
he
,
of
terrifying
you
to
my
will
,
since
I
could
not
move
you
by
love
;
and
Mrs.
Jewkes
too
well
obeyed
me
,
when
the
terrors
of
your
return
,
after
your
disappointment
,
were
so
great
,
that
you
had
hardly
courage
to
withstand
them
;
but
had
like
to
have
made
so
fatal
a
choice
,
to
escape
the
treatment
you
apprehended
.
  
<EOS>
O
sir
,
said
I
,
I
have
reason
,
I
am
sure
,
to
bless
my
dear
parents
,
and
my
good
lady
,
your
mother
,
for
giving
me
something
of
a
religious
education
;
for
,
but
for
that
,
and
God
's
grace
,
<EOS>
I
should
,
more
than
upon
one
occasion
,
have
attempted
,
at
least
,
a
desperate
act
:
<EOS>
and
I
the
less
wonder
how
poor
creatures
,
who
have
not
the
fear
of
God
before
their
eyes
,
and
give
way
to
despondency
,
cast
themselves
into
perdition
.
  
<EOS>
Come
,
kiss
me
,
said
he
,
and
tell
me
you
forgive
me
for
pushing
you
into
so
much
danger
and
distress
.
 
<EOS>
If
my
mind
hold
,
and
I
can
see
those
former
papers
of
yours
,
and
that
these
in
my
pocket
give
me
no
cause
to
altar
my
opinion
<EOS>
,
I
will
endeavour
to
defy
the
world
and
the
world
's
censures
,
and
make
my
Pamela
amends
,
if
it
be
in
the
power
of
my
whole
life
,
for
all
the
hardships
I
have
made
her
undergo
.
  
<EOS>
All
this
looked
well
;
but
you
shall
see
how
strangely
it
was
all
turned
.
<EOS>
For
this
sham
-
marriage
then
came
into
my
mind
again
;
and
I
said
,
Your
poor
servant
is
far
unworthy
of
this
great
honour
;
for
what
will
it
be
but
to
create
envy
to
herself
,
and
discredit
to
you
?
 
<EOS>
Therefore
,
sir
,
permit
me
to
return
to
my
poor
parents
,
and
that
is
all
I
have
to
ask
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
in
a
fearful
passion
then
.
 
<EOS>
And
is
it
thus
,
said
he
,
in
my
fond
conceding
moments
,
that
I
am
to
be
despised
and
answered
?
 
<EOS>
Precise
,
perverse
,
unseasonable
Pamela
!
<EOS>
begone
from
my
sight
!
<EOS>
and
know
as
well
how
to
behave
in
a
hopeful
prospect
,
as
in
a
distressful
state
;
and
then
,
and
not
till
then
,
shalt
thou
attract
the
shadow
of
my
notice
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
startled
,
and
going
to
speak
:
but
he
stamped
with
his
foot
,
and
said
,
Begone
!
 
<EOS>
I
tell
you
:
I
can
not
bear
this
stupid
romantic
folly
.
  
<EOS>
One
word
,
said
I
;
but
one
word
,
I
beseech
you
,
sir
.
  
<EOS>
He
turned
from
me
in
great
wrath
,
and
took
down
another
alley
,
and
so
I
went
,
with
a
very
heavy
heart
;
and
fear
I
was
too
unseasonable
,
just
at
a
time
when
he
was
so
condescending
:
but
if
it
was
a
piece
of
art
of
his
side
,
as
I
apprehended
,
to
introduce
the
sham
-
wedding
,
(
and
,
to
be
sure
,
he
is
very
full
of
stratagem
and
art
,
)
<EOS>
I
think
I
was
not
so
much
to
blame
.
  
<EOS>
So
I
went
up
to
my
closet
;
and
wrote
thus
far
,
while
he
walked
about
till
dinner
was
ready
;
and
he
is
now
sat
down
to
it
,
as
I
hear
by
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
very
sullen
,
thoughtful
,
and
out
of
humour
;
and
she
asks
,
What
I
have
done
to
him
?
 
<EOS>
Now
,
again
,
I
dread
to
see
him
!
 
<EOS>
When
will
my
fears
be
over
?
  
<EOS>
Three
o'clock
.
  
<EOS>
Well
,
he
continues
exceeding
wrath
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
ordered
his
travelling
chariot
to
be
got
ready
with
all
speed
.
 
<EOS>
What
is
to
come
next
,
I
wonder
!
  
<EOS>
Sure
I
did
not
say
so
much
!
 
<EOS>
But
see
the
lordliness
of
a
high
condition
!
  
<EOS>
A
 
poor
body
must
not
put
in
a
word
,
when
they
take
it
into
their
heads
to
be
angry
!
 
<EOS>
What
a
fine
time
a
person
of
an
equal
condition
would
have
of
it
,
if
she
were
even
to
marry
such
a
one
!
 
<EOS>
His
poor
dear
mother
spoiled
him
at
first
.
 
<EOS>
Nobody
must
speak
to
him
or
contradict
him
,
as
I
have
heard
,
when
he
was
a
child
;
and
so
he
has
not
been
used
to
be
controlled
,
and
can
not
bear
the
least
thing
that
crosses
his
violent
will
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
one
of
the
blessings
attending
men
of
high
condition
!
<EOS>
Much
good
may
do
them
with
their
pride
of
birth
,
and
pride
of
fortune
!
<EOS>
say
I
:
 
All
that
it
serves
for
,
as
far
as
I
can
see
,
is
,
to
multiply
their
disquiets
,
and
every
body
's
else
that
has
to
do
with
them
.
  
<EOS>
So
,
so
!
<EOS>
where
will
this
end
?
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
has
been
with
me
from
him
,
and
she
says
,
I
must
get
out
of
the
house
this
moment
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
said
I
,
but
whither
am
I
to
be
carried
next
?
 
<EOS>
Why
,
home
,
said
she
,
to
your
father
and
mother
.
 
<EOS>
And
can
it
be
?
<EOS>
said
I
;
<EOS>
No
,
no
,
I
doubt
I
shall
not
be
so
happy
as
that
!
 
<EOS>
To
be
sure
some
bad
design
is
on
foot
again
!
 
<EOS>
To
be
sure
it
is
!
 
<EOS>
Sure
,
sure
,
said
I
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
<EOS>
,
he
has
not
found
out
some
other
housekeeper
worse
than
you
!
 
<EOS>
She
was
very
angry
,
you
may
well
think
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
know
she
ca
n't
be
made
worse
than
she
is
.
  
<EOS>
She
came
up
again
.
 
<EOS>
Are
you
ready
?
<EOS>
said
she
.
 
<EOS>
Bless
me
,
said
I
,
you
are
very
hasty
!
 
<EOS>
I
have
heard
of
this
not
a
quarter
of
an
hour
ago
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
shall
be
soon
ready
;
<EOS>
for
I
have
but
little
to
take
with
me
,
and
no
kind
friends
in
this
house
to
take
leave
of
,
to
delay
me
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
,
like
a
fool
,
I
ca
n't
help
crying
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
,
said
I
,
just
step
down
,
and
ask
,
if
I
may
not
have
my
papers
.
  
<EOS>
So
,
I
am
quite
ready
now
,
against
<EOS>
she
comes
up
with
an
answer
;
and
so
I
will
put
up
these
few
writings
in
my
bosom
,
that
I
have
left
.
  
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
what
to
think
 
nor
how
to
judge
;
but
I
shall
never
believe
I
am
with
you
,
till
I
am
on
my
knees
before
you
,
begging
both
your
blessings
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
I
am
sorry
he
is
so
angry
with
me
!
 
<EOS>
I
thought
I
did
not
say
so
much
!
  
<EOS>
There
is
,
I
see
,
the
chariot
drawn
out
,
the
horses
too
,
the
grim
Colbrand
going
to
get
on
horseback
.
 
<EOS>
What
will
be
the
end
of
all
this
?
  
<EOS>
Monday
.
  
<EOS>
Well
,
where
this
will
end
,
I
can
not
say
.
 
<EOS>
But
here
I
am
,
at
a
little
poor
village
,
almost
such
a
one
as
yours
!
 
<EOS>
I
shall
learn
the
name
of
it
by
and
by
:
and
Robin
assures
me
,
he
has
orders
to
carry
me
to
you
,
my
dear
father
and
mother
.
 
<EOS>
O
that
he
may
say
truth
,
and
not
deceive
me
again
!
<EOS>
But
having
nothing
else
to
do
,
and
I
am
sure
I
shall
not
sleep
a
wink
to
-
night
,
if
I
was
to
go
to
bed
,
I
will
write
my
time
away
,
and
take
up
my
story
where
I
left
off
,
on
Sunday
afternoon
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
came
up
to
me
,
with
this
answer
about
my
papers
:
My
master
says
,
he
will
not
read
them
yet
,
lest
he
should
be
moved
by
any
thing
in
them
to
alter
his
resolution
.
 
<EOS>
But
if
he
should
think
it
worth
while
to
read
them
,
he
will
send
them
to
you
,
afterwards
,
to
your
father
's
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
said
she
,
here
are
your
guineas
that
I
borrowed
:
for
all
is
over
now
with
you
,
I
find
.
  
<EOS>
She
saw
me
cry
,
and
said
,
Do
you
repent
?
 
<EOS>
Of
what
?
<EOS>
said
<EOS>
I.
 
Nay
,
I
ca
n't
tell
,
replied
she
;
but
,
to
be
sure
,
he
has
had
a
taste
of
your
satirical
flings
,
or
he
would
not
be
so
angry
.
 
<EOS>
O
!
<EOS>
continued
she
,
and
held
up
her
hand
,
<EOS>
thou
hast
a
spirit
!
 
<EOS>
But
I
hope
it
will
now
be
brought
down
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
so
too
,
said
I.
  
<EOS>
Well
,
added
I
,
I
am
ready
.
 
<EOS>
She
lifted
up
the
window
,
and
said
,
I
'll
call
Robin
to
take
your
portmanteau
:
<EOS>
Bag
and
baggage
!
<EOS>
proceeded
she
<EOS>
,
I
'm
glad
you
're
going
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
words
,
said
I
,
to
throw
away
upon
you
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
;
but
,
making
her
a
very
low
courtesy
,
I
most
heartily
thank
you
for
all
your
virtuous
civilities
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
adieu
<EOS>
;
for
I
'll
have
no
portmanteau
,
I
'll
assure
you
,
nor
any
thing
but
these
few
things
that
I
brought
with
me
in
my
handkerchief
,
besides
what
I
have
on
.
 
<EOS>
For
I
had
all
this
time
worn
my
own
bought
clothes
,
though
my
master
would
have
had
it
otherwise
often
:
<EOS>
but
I
had
put
up
paper
,
ink
,
and
pens
,
however
.
  
<EOS>
So
down
I
went
,
and
as
I
passed
by
the
parlour
,
she
stepped
in
,
and
said
,
Sir
,
you
have
nothing
to
say
to
the
girl
before
she
goes
?
 
<EOS>
I
heard
him
reply
,
though
I
did
not
see
him
,
<EOS>
Who
bid
you
say
,
the
girl
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
in
that
manner
?
 
<EOS>
She
has
offended
only
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
beg
your
honour
's
pardon
,
said
the
wretch
;
but
if
I
was
your
honour
,
she
should
not
,
for
all
the
trouble
she
has
cost
you
,
go
away
scot
-
free
.
<EOS>
No
more
of
this
,
as
I
told
you
before
,
said
he
:
<EOS>
What
!
<EOS>
when
I
have
such
proof
,
that
her
virtue
is
all
her
pride
,
shall
I
rob
her
of
that
?
 
<EOS>
No
,
added
he
,
let
her
go
,
perverse
and
foolish
as
she
is
;
but
she
deserves
to
go
honest
,
and
she
shall
go
so
!
  
<EOS>
I
was
so
transported
with
this
unexpected
goodness
,
that
I
opened
the
door
before
I
knew
what
I
did
;
and
said
,
falling
on
my
knees
at
the
door
,
with
my
hands
folded
,
and
lifted
up
,
O
thank
you
,
thank
your
honour
,
a
million
of
times
!
 
<EOS>
May
God
bless
you
for
this
instance
of
your
goodness
to
me
!
 
<EOS>
I
will
pray
for
you
as
long
as
I
live
,
and
so
shall
my
dear
father
and
mother
.
 
<EOS>
And
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
<EOS>
,
said
I
,
I
will
pray
for
you
too
,
poor
wicked
wretch
that
you
are
!
  
<EOS>
He
turned
from
me
,
and
went
into
his
closet
,
and
shut
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
He
need
not
have
done
so
;
for
I
would
not
have
gone
nearer
to
him
!
  
<EOS>
Surely
I
did
not
say
so
much
,
to
incur
all
this
displeasure
.
  
<EOS>
I
think
I
was
loath
to
leave
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
Can
you
believe
it
?
 
<EOS>
What
could
be
the
matter
with
me
,
I
wonder
?
 
<EOS>
I
felt
something
so
strange
,
and
my
heart
was
so
lumpish
!
 
<EOS>
I
wonder
what
ailed
me
!
 
<EOS>
But
this
was
so
unexpected
!
 
<EOS>
I
believe
that
was
all
!
 
<EOS>
Yet
I
am
very
strange
still
.
<EOS>
Surely
,
surely
,
I
can
not
be
like
the
old
murmuring
Israelites
,
to
long
after
the
onions
and
garlick
of
Egypt
,
when
they
had
suffered
there
such
heavy
bondage
?
 
<EOS>
I
'll
take
thee
,
O
lumpish
,
contradictory
,
ungovernable
heart
!
<EOS>
to
severe
task
,
for
this
thy
strange
impulse
,
when
I
get
to
my
dear
father
's
and
mother
's
;
and
if
I
find
any
thing
in
thee
that
should
not
be
,
depend
upon
it
thou
shalt
be
humbled
,
if
strict
abstinence
,
prayer
,
and
mortification
,
will
do
it
!
  
<EOS>
But
yet
,
after
all
,
this
last
goodness
of
his
has
touched
me
too
sensibly
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
I
had
not
heard
it
,
almost
;
and
yet
,
methinks
,
I
am
glad
I
did
;
for
I
should
rejoice
to
think
the
best
of
him
,
for
his
own
sake
.
  
<EOS>
Well
,
and
so
I
went
out
to
the
chariot
,
the
same
that
brought
me
down
.
<EOS>
So
,
Mr.
Robert
,
said
I
,
here
I
am
again
!
<EOS>
a
poor
sporting
-
piece
for
the
great
!
<EOS>
a
mere
tennis
-
ball
of
fortune
!
 
<EOS>
You
have
your
orders
,
I
hope
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
madam
,
said
he
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
,
now
,
said
I
,
do
n't
madam
me
,
nor
stand
with
your
hat
off
to
such
a
one
as
I.
 
<EOS>
Had
not
my
master
,
said
he
,
ordered
me
not
to
be
wanting
in
respect
to
you
<EOS>
,
I
would
have
shewn
you
all
I
could
.
<EOS>
Well
,
said
I
,
with
my
heart
full
,
that
's
very
kind
,
Mr.
Robert
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Colbrand
,
mounted
on
horseback
,
with
pistols
before
him
,
came
up
to
me
,
as
soon
as
I
got
in
,
with
his
hat
off
too
.
 
<EOS>
What
,
monsieur
!
<EOS>
said
I
,
are
you
to
go
with
me
?
 
<EOS>
Part
of
the
way
,
he
said
,
to
see
you
safe
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
that
's
kind
too
,
in
you
,
Mr.
Colbrand
,
said
I.
  
I
had
nobody
to
wave
my
handkerchief
to
now
,
nor
to
take
leave
of
;
and
so
I
resigned
myself
to
my
contemplations
,
with
this
strange
wayward
heart
of
mine
,
that
I
never
found
so
ungovernable
and
awkward
before
.
  
<EOS>
So
away
drove
the
chariot
!
 
<EOS>
And
when
I
had
got
out
of
the
elm
-
walk
,
and
into
the
great
road
,
I
could
hardly
think
<EOS>
but
I
was
in
a
dream
all
the
time
.
 
<EOS>
A
few
hours
before
,
in
my
master
's
arms
almost
,
with
twenty
kind
things
said
to
me
,
and
a
generous
concern
for
the
misfortunes
he
had
brought
upon
me
;
and
only
by
one
rash
half
-
word
exasperated
against
me
,
and
turned
out
of
doors
,
at
an
hour
's
warning
;
and
all
his
kindness
changed
to
hate
!
 
<EOS>
And
I
now
,
from
three
o'clock
to
five
,
several
miles
off
!
 
<EOS>
But
if
I
am
going
to
you
,
all
will
be
well
again
,
I
hope
.
  
<EOS>
Lack
-
a
-
day
,
what
strange
creatures
are
men
!
<EOS>
gentlemen
,
I
should
say
,
rather
!
 
<EOS>
For
,
my
dear
deserving
good
mother
,
though
poverty
be
both
your
lots
,
has
had
better
hap
,
and
you
are
,
and
have
always
been
,
blest
in
one
another
!
 
<EOS>
Yet
this
pleases
me
too
;
he
was
so
good
<EOS>
,
he
would
not
let
Mrs.
Jewkes
speak
ill
of
me
,
and
scorned
to
take
her
odious
unwomanly
advice
.
<EOS>
O
,
what
a
black
heart
has
this
poor
wretch
!
 
<EOS>
So
I
need
not
rail
against
men
so
much
;
for
my
master
,
bad
as
I
have
thought
him
,
is
not
half
so
bad
as
this
woman
.
 
<EOS>
To
be
sure
she
must
be
an
atheist
!
 
<EOS>
Do
you
think
she
is
not
?
  
<EOS>
We
could
not
reach
further
than
this
little
poor
place
and
sad
alehouse
,
rather
than
inn
;
for
it
began
to
be
dark
,
and
Robin
did
not
make
so
much
haste
as
he
might
have
done
;
and
he
was
forced
to
make
hard
shift
for
his
horses
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Colbrand
,
and
Robert
too
,
are
very
civil
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
he
has
got
my
portmanteau
lashed
behind
the
coach
.
 
<EOS>
I
did
not
desire
it
;
but
I
shall
not
come
quite
empty
.
  
<EOS>
A
thorough
riddance
of
me
<EOS>
,
I
see
!
 
<EOS>
Bag
and
baggage
!
<EOS>
as
Mrs.
Jewkes
says
.
<EOS>
Well
,
my
story
surely
would
furnish
out
a
surprising
kind
of
novel
,
if
it
was
to
be
well
told
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Robert
came
up
to
me
,
just
now
,
and
begged
me
to
eat
something
:
<EOS>
I
thanked
him
;
but
said
,
I
could
not
eat
.
 
<EOS>
I
bid
him
ask
Mr.
Colbrand
to
walk
up
;
and
he
came
;
but
neither
of
them
would
sit
;
nor
put
their
hats
on
.
 
<EOS>
What
mockado
is
this
,
to
such
a
poor
soul
as
I
!
 
<EOS>
I
asked
them
,
if
they
were
at
liberty
to
tell
me
the
truth
of
what
they
were
to
do
with
me
?
 
<EOS>
If
not
,
I
would
not
desire
it
.
 
<EOS>
They
both
said
,
Robin
was
ordered
to
carry
me
to
my
father
's
;
and
Mr.
Colbrand
was
to
leave
me
within
ten
miles
,
and
then
strike
off
for
the
other
house
,
and
wait
till
my
master
arrived
there
.
 
<EOS>
They
both
spoke
so
solemnly
,
that
I
could
not
but
believe
them
.
  
<EOS>
But
when
Robin
went
down
,
the
other
said
,
he
had
a
letter
to
give
me
next
day
at
noon
,
when
we
baited
,
as
we
were
to
do
,
at
Mrs.
Jewkes
's
relation
's
.
 
<EOS>
May
I
not
,
said
I
,
beg
the
favour
to
see
it
to
-
night
?
 
<EOS>
He
seemed
so
loath
to
deny
me
,
that
I
have
hopes
I
shall
prevail
on
him
by
and
by
.
  
<EOS>
Well
,
my
dear
father
and
mother
,
I
have
got
the
letter
,
on
great
promises
of
secrecy
,
and
making
no
use
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
try
if
I
can
open
it
without
breaking
the
seal
,
and
will
take
a
copy
of
it
by
and
by
;
for
Robin
is
in
and
out
:
there
being
hardly
any
room
in
this
little
house
for
one
to
be
long
alone
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
this
is
the
letter
:
  
<EOS>
"
When
these
lines
are
delivered
to
you
,
you
will
be
far
on
your
way
to
your
father
and
mother
,
where
you
have
so
long
desired
to
be
:
and
,
I
hope
,
I
shall
forbear
thinking
of
you
with
the
least
shadow
of
that
fondness
my
foolish
heart
had
entertained
for
you
:
<EOS>
I
bear
you
,
however
,
no
ill
will
;
but
the
end
of
my
detaining
you
being
over
,
I
would
not
that
you
should
tarry
with
me
an
hour
more
than
needed
,
after
the
ungenerous
preference
you
gave
,
at
a
time
that
I
was
inclined
to
pass
over
all
other
considerations
,
for
an
honourable
address
to
you
;
for
well
I
found
the
tables
entirely
turned
upon
me
,
and
that
I
was
in
far
more
danger
from
you
,
than
you
were
from
me
;
for
I
was
just
upon
resolving
to
defy
all
the
censures
of
the
world
,
and
to
make
you
my
wife
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
acknowledge
another
truth
:
That
,
had
I
not
parted
with
you
as
I
did
,
but
permitted
you
to
stay
till
I
had
read
your
journal
,
reflecting
,
as
I
doubt
not
I
shall
find
it
,
and
till
I
had
heard
your
bewitching
pleas
in
your
own
behalf
,
I
feared
I
could
not
trust
myself
with
my
own
resolution
.
 
<EOS>
And
this
is
the
reason
<EOS>
,
I
frankly
own
,
that
I
have
determined
not
to
see
you
,
nor
hear
you
speak
;
for
well
I
know
my
weakness
in
your
favour
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
will
get
the
better
of
this
fond
folly
:
<EOS>
Nay
,
I
hope
I
have
already
done
it
,
since
it
was
likely
to
cost
me
so
dear
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
write
this
to
tell
you
,
that
I
wish
you
well
with
all
my
heart
,
though
you
have
spread
such
mischief
through
my
family
.
 
<EOS>
And
yet
I
can
not
but
say
that
I
could
wish
you
would
not
think
of
marrying
in
haste
;
and
,
particularly
,
that
you
would
not
have
this
cursed
Williams
.
 
<EOS>
But
what
is
all
this
to
me
now
?
 
<EOS>
Only
,
my
weakness
makes
me
say
,
That
as
I
had
already
looked
upon
you
as
mine
,
and
you
have
so
soon
got
rid
of
your
first
husband
;
so
you
will
not
refuse
,
to
my
memory
,
the
decency
that
every
common
person
observes
,
to
pay
a
twelvemonth
's
compliment
,
though
but
a
mere
compliment
,
to
my
ashes
.
  
<EOS>
"
Your
papers
shall
be
faithfully
returned
you
;
and
I
have
paid
so
dear
for
my
curiosity
in
the
affection
they
have
rivetted
upon
me
for
you
,
that
you
would
look
upon
yourself
amply
revenged
if
you
knew
what
they
have
cost
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
thought
of
writing
only
a
few
lines
;
but
I
have
run
into
length
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
now
try
to
recollect
my
scattered
thoughts
,
and
resume
my
reason
;
and
shall
find
trouble
enough
to
replace
my
affairs
,
and
my
own
family
,
and
to
supply
the
chasms
you
have
made
in
it
:
For
,
let
me
tell
you
,
though
I
can
forgive
you
,
I
never
can
my
sister
,
nor
my
domestics
;
for
my
vengeance
must
be
wreaked
somewhere
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
doubt
not
your
prudence
in
forbearing
to
expose
me
any
more
than
is
necessary
for
your
own
justification
;
and
for
that
I
will
suffer
myself
to
be
accused
by
you
,
and
will
also
accuse
myself
,
if
it
be
needful
.
 
<EOS>
For
I
am
,
and
will
ever
be
,
             
"
<EOS>
Your
affectionate
well
-
wisher
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
letter
,
when
I
expected
some
new
plot
,
has
affected
me
more
than
any
thing
of
that
sort
could
have
done
.
 
<EOS>
For
here
is
plainly
his
great
value
for
me
confessed
,
and
his
rigorous
behaviour
accounted
for
in
such
a
manner
,
as
tortures
me
much
.
 
<EOS>
And
all
this
wicked
gipsy
story
is
,
as
it
seems
,
a
forgery
upon
us
both
,
and
has
quite
ruined
me
:
<EOS>
For
,
O
my
dear
parents
,
forgive
me
!
<EOS>
but
I
found
,
to
my
grief
,
before
,
that
my
heart
was
too
partial
in
his
favour
;
but
now
with
so
much
openness
,
so
much
affection
;
nay
,
so
much
honour
too
,
(
<EOS>
which
was
all
I
had
before
doubted
,
and
kept
me
on
the
reserve
,
)
<EOS>
I
am
quite
overcome
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
a
happiness
,
however
,
I
had
no
reason
to
expect
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
to
be
sure
,
I
must
own
to
you
,
that
I
shall
never
be
able
to
think
of
any
body
in
the
world
but
him
.
  
<EOS>
Presumption
!
<EOS>
you
will
say
;
and
so
it
is
:
<EOS>
But
love
is
not
a
voluntary
thing
:
Love
,
did
I
say
?
 
<EOS>
But
come
<EOS>
,
I
hope
not
:
 
<EOS>
At
least
it
is
not
,
I
hope
,
gone
so
far
as
to
make
me
very
uneasy
:
<EOS>
For
I
know
not
how
it
came
,
nor
when
it
began
;
but
crept
,
crept
it
has
,
like
a
thief
,
upon
me
;
and
before
I
knew
what
was
the
matter
,
it
looked
like
love
.
  
<EOS>
I
wish
,
since
it
is
too
late
,
and
my
lot
determined
,
that
I
had
not
had
this
letter
,
nor
heard
him
take
my
part
to
that
vile
woman
;
for
then
I
should
have
blessed
myself
in
having
escaped
so
happily
his
designing
arts
upon
my
virtue
:
but
now
my
poor
mind
is
all
topsy
-
turvied
,
and
I
have
made
an
escape
to
be
more
a
prisoner
.
  
<EOS>
But
I
hope
,
since
thus
it
is
,
that
all
will
be
for
the
best
;
and
I
shall
,
with
your
prudent
advice
,
and
pious
prayers
,
be
able
to
overcome
this
weakness
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
to
be
sure
,
my
dear
sir
,
I
will
keep
a
longer
time
than
a
twelvemonth
,
as
a
true
widow
,
for
a
compliment
,
and
more
than
a
compliment
,
to
your
ashes
!
 
<EOS>
O
the
dear
word
!
 
<EOS>
How
kind
,
how
moving
,
how
affectionate
is
the
word
!
 
<EOS>
O
why
was
I
not
a
duchess
,
to
shew
my
gratitude
for
it
!
 
<EOS>
But
must
labour
under
the
weight
of
an
obligation
,
even
had
this
happiness
befallen
me
,
that
would
have
pressed
me
to
death
,
and
which
I
never
could
return
by
a
whole
life
of
faithful
love
,
and
cheerful
obedience
.
  
<EOS>
O
forgive
your
poor
daughter
!
 
<EOS>
I
am
sorry
to
find
this
trial
so
sore
upon
me
;
and
that
all
the
weakness
of
my
weak
sex
,
and
tender
years
,
who
never
before
knew
what
it
was
to
be
so
touched
,
is
come
upon
me
,
and
too
mighty
to
be
withstood
by
me
.
 
<EOS>
But
time
,
prayer
,
and
resignation
to
God
's
will
,
and
the
benefits
of
your
good
lessons
,
and
examples
,
I
hope
,
will
enable
me
to
get
over
this
so
heavy
a
trial
.
  
<EOS>
O
my
treacherous
,
treacherous
heart
!
<EOS>
to
serve
me
thus
!
<EOS>
and
give
no
notice
to
me
of
the
mischiefs
thou
wast
about
to
bring
upon
me
!
 
<EOS>
But
thus
foolishly
to
give
thyself
up
to
the
proud
invader
,
without
ever
consulting
thy
poor
mistress
in
the
least
!
 
<EOS>
But
thy
punishment
will
be
the
first
and
the
greatest
;
and
well
deservest
thou
to
smart
,
O
perfidious
traitor
!
<EOS>
for
giving
up
so
weakly
thy
whole
self
,
before
a
summons
came
;
and
to
one
,
too
,
who
had
used
me
so
hardly
;
and
when
,
likewise
,
thou
hadst
so
well
maintained
thy
post
against
the
most
violent
and
avowed
,
and
,
therefore
,
as
I
thought
,
more
dangerous
attacks
!
  
<EOS>
After
all
,
I
must
either
not
shew
you
this
my
weakness
,
or
tear
it
out
of
my
writing
.
 
<EOS>
Memorandum
:
to
consider
of
this
,
when
I
get
home
.
  
<EOS>
Monday
morning
,
eleven
o'clock
.
  
<EOS>
We
are
just
come
in
here
,
to
the
inn
kept
by
Mrs.
Jewkes
's
relation
.
 
<EOS>
The
first
compliment
I
had
,
was
in
a
very
impudent
manner
,
How
I
liked
the
"
squire
?
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
help
saying
,
Bold
,
forward
woman
!
 
<EOS>
Is
it
for
you
,
who
keep
an
inn
,
to
treat
passengers
at
this
rate
?
 
<EOS>
She
was
but
in
jest
,
she
said
,
and
asked
pardon
:
<EOS>
And
she
came
,
and
begged
excuse
again
,
very
submissively
,
after
Robin
and
Mr.
Colbrand
had
talked
to
her
a
little
.
  
<EOS>
The
latter
here
,
in
great
form
,
gave
me
,
before
Robin
,
the
letter
which
I
had
given
him
back
for
that
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
retired
,
as
if
to
read
it
;
and
so
I
did
;
for
I
think
I
ca
n't
read
it
too
often
;
though
,
for
my
peace
of
mind
's
sake
,
I
might
better
try
to
forget
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
sorry
,
methinks
<EOS>
,
I
can
not
bring
you
back
a
sound
heart
;
but
,
indeed
,
it
is
an
honest
one
,
as
to
any
body
but
me
;
for
it
has
deceived
nobody
else
:
Wicked
thing
that
it
is
!
  
<EOS>
More
and
more
surprising
things
still
     
Just
as
I
had
sat
down
,
to
try
to
eat
a
bit
of
victuals
,
to
get
ready
to
pursue
my
journey
,
came
in
Mr.
Colbrand
in
a
mighty
hurry
.
 
<EOS>
O
madam
!
<EOS>
madam
!
<EOS>
said
he
,
here
be
de
groom
from
de
"
Squire
B
#
#
#
#
,
all
over
in
a
lather
,
man
and
horse
!
 
<EOS>
O
how
my
heart
went
pit
-
a
-
pat
!
 
<EOS>
What
now
,
thought
<EOS>
I
,
is
to
come
next
!
 
<EOS>
He
went
out
,
and
presently
returned
with
a
letter
for
me
,
and
another
,
enclosed
,
for
Mr.
Colbrand
.
 
<EOS>
This
seemed
odd
,
and
put
me
all
in
a
trembling
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
shut
the
door
;
and
never
,
sure
,
was
the
like
known
!
<EOS>
found
the
following
agreeable
contents
:
    
<EOS>
"
In
vain
,
my
Pamela
,
do
I
find
it
to
struggle
against
my
affection
for
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
needs
,
after
you
were
gone
,
venture
to
entertain
myself
with
your
Journal
,
when
I
found
Mrs.
Jewkes
's
bad
usage
of
you
,
after
your
dreadful
temptations
and
hurts
;
and
particularly
your
generous
concern
for
me
,
on
hearing
how
narrowly
I
escaped
drowning
;
(
though
my
death
would
have
been
your
freedom
,
and
I
had
made
it
your
interest
to
wish
it
)
;
and
your
most
agreeable
confession
in
another
place
,
that
,
notwithstanding
all
my
hard
usage
of
you
,
you
could
not
hate
me
;
and
that
expressed
in
so
sweet
,
so
soft
,
and
so
innocent
a
manner
,
that
I
flatter
myself
<EOS>
you
may
be
brought
to
love
me
:
(
together
with
the
other
parts
of
your
admirable
Journal
:
)
<EOS>
I
began
to
repent
my
parting
with
you
;
but
,
God
is
my
witness
!
<EOS>
for
no
unlawful
end
,
as
you
would
call
it
;
but
the
very
contrary
:
and
the
rather
,
as
all
this
was
improved
in
your
favour
,
by
your
behaviour
at
leaving
my
house
:
<EOS>
For
,
oh
!
<EOS>
that
melodious
voice
praying
for
me
at
your
departure
,
and
thanking
me
for
my
rebuke
to
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
still
hangs
upon
my
ears
,
and
delights
my
memory
.
 
<EOS>
And
though
I
went
to
bed
,
I
could
not
rest
;
but
about
two
got
up
,
and
made
Thomas
get
one
of
the
best
horses
ready
,
in
order
to
set
out
to
overtake
you
,
while
I
sat
down
to
write
this
to
you
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
my
dear
Pamela
,
let
me
beg
of
you
,
on
the
receipt
of
this
,
to
order
Robin
to
drive
you
back
again
to
my
house
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
have
set
out
myself
,
for
the
pleasure
of
bearing
you
company
back
in
the
chariot
;
but
am
really
indisposed
;
I
believe
,
with
vexation
that
I
should
part
thus
with
my
soul
's
delight
,
as
I
now
find
you
are
,
and
must
be
,
in
spite
of
the
pride
of
my
own
heart
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
can
not
imagine
the
obligation
your
return
will
lay
me
under
to
your
goodness
;
and
<EOS>
yet
,
if
you
will
not
so
far
favour
me
,
you
shall
be
under
no
restraint
,
as
you
will
see
by
my
letter
enclosed
to
Colbrand
;
which
I
have
not
sealed
,
that
you
may
read
it
.
 
<EOS>
But
spare
me
,
my
dearest
girl
!
<EOS>
the
confusion
of
following
you
to
your
father
's
;
which
I
must
do
,
if
you
persist
to
go
on
;
for
I
find
I
can
not
live
a
day
without
you
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
are
the
generous
Pamela
I
imagine
you
to
be
,
(
for
hitherto
you
have
been
all
goodness
,
where
it
has
not
been
merited
,
)
<EOS>
let
me
see
,
by
this
new
instance
,
the
further
excellence
of
your
disposition
;
let
me
see
you
can
forgive
the
man
who
loves
you
more
than
himself
;
let
me
see
,
by
it
,
that
you
are
not
prepossessed
in
any
other
person
's
favour
:
<EOS>
And
one
instance
more
I
would
beg
,
and
then
I
am
all
gratitude
;
and
that
is
,
that
you
would
despatch
Monsieur
Colbrand
with
a
letter
to
your
father
,
assuring
him
that
all
will
end
happily
;
and
to
desire
,
that
he
will
send
to
you
,
at
my
house
,
the
letters
you
found
means
,
by
Williams
's
conveyance
,
to
send
him
.
 
<EOS>
And
when
I
have
all
my
proud
,
and
,
perhaps
,
punctilious
doubts
answered
,
I
shall
have
nothing
to
do
,
but
to
make
you
happy
,
and
be
so
myself
.
 
<EOS>
For
I
must
be
        
<EOS>
"
Yours
,
and
only
yours
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Monday
morn
,
near
three
o'clock
.
"
  
O
my
exulting
heart
!
<EOS>
how
it
throbs
in
my
bosom
,
as
if
it
would
reproach
me
for
so
lately
upbraiding
it
for
giving
way
to
the
love
of
so
dear
a
gentleman
!
 
<EOS>
But
take
care
thou
art
<EOS>
not
too
credulous
neither
,
O
fond
believer
!
 
<EOS>
Things
that
we
wish
,
are
apt
to
gain
a
too
ready
credence
with
us
.
 
<EOS>
This
sham
-
marriage
is
not
yet
cleared
up
:
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
the
vile
Mrs.
Jewkes
!
<EOS>
may
yet
instigate
the
mind
of
this
master
:
<EOS>
His
pride
of
heart
,
and
pride
of
condition
,
may
again
take
place
:
And
a
man
that
could
in
so
little
a
space
,
first
love
me
,
then
hate
,
then
banish
me
his
house
,
and
send
me
away
disgracefully
;
and
now
send
for
me
again
,
in
such
affectionate
terms
,
may
still
waver
,
may
still
deceive
thee
.
 
<EOS>
Therefore
will
I
not
acquit
thee
yet
,
O
credulous
,
fluttering
,
throbbing
mischief
!
<EOS>
that
art
so
ready
to
believe
what
thou
wishest
!
 
<EOS>
And
I
charge
thee
to
keep
better
guard
than
thou
hast
lately
done
,
and
lead
me
not
to
follow
too
implicitly
thy
flattering
and
desirable
impulses
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
foolishly
dialogued
I
with
my
heart
;
and
<EOS>
yet
,
all
the
time
,
this
heart
is
Pamela
.
  
<EOS>
I
opened
the
letter
to
Monsieur
Colbrand
;
which
was
in
these
words
:
    
"
<EOS>
MONSIEUR
,
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
you
'll
excuse
the
trouble
I
give
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
,
for
good
reasons
,
changed
my
mind
;
and
I
have
besought
it
,
as
a
favour
,
that
Mrs.
Andrews
will
return
to
me
the
moment
Tom
reaches
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
,
for
the
reasons
I
have
given
her
,
she
will
have
the
goodness
to
oblige
me
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
if
not
,
you
are
to
order
Robin
to
pursue
his
directions
,
and
set
her
down
at
her
father
's
door
.
 
<EOS>
If
she
will
oblige
me
in
her
return
,
perhaps
she
'll
give
you
a
letter
to
her
father
,
for
some
papers
to
be
delivered
to
you
for
her
;
which
you
'll
be
so
good
,
in
that
case
,
to
bring
to
her
here
:
<EOS>
But
if
she
will
not
give
you
such
a
letter
,
you
'll
return
with
her
to
me
,
if
she
please
to
favour
me
so
far
;
and
that
with
all
expedition
,
that
her
health
and
safety
will
permit
;
for
I
am
pretty
much
indisposed
;
but
hope
it
will
be
but
slight
,
and
soon
go
off
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
   
<EOS>
"
Yours
,
etc
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
On
second
thoughts
,
let
Tom
go
forward
with
Mrs.
Andrews
's
letter
,
if
she
pleases
to
give
one
;
and
you
return
with
her
,
for
her
safety
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Now
this
is
a
dear
generous
manner
of
treating
me
.
 
<EOS>
O
how
I
love
to
be
generously
used
!
 
<EOS>
Now
,
my
dear
parents
,
I
wish
I
could
consult
you
for
your
opinions
,
how
I
should
act
.
 
<EOS>
Should
I
go
back
,
or
should
I
not
?
 
<EOS>
I
doubt
he
has
got
too
great
hold
in
my
heart
,
for
me
to
be
easy
presently
,
if
I
should
refuse
:
<EOS>
And
yet
this
gipsy
information
makes
me
fearful
.
  
<EOS>
Well
,
I
will
,
I
think
,
trust
in
his
generosity
!
 
<EOS>
Yet
is
it
not
too
great
a
trust
?
 
<EOS>
especially
considering
how
I
have
been
used
!
 
<EOS>
But
then
that
was
while
he
avowed
his
bad
designs
;
and
now
he
gives
great
hope
of
his
good
ones
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
may
be
the
means
of
making
many
happy
,
as
well
as
myself
,
by
placing
a
generous
confidence
in
him
.
  
<EOS>
And
then
,
I
think
,
he
might
have
sent
to
Colbrand
,
or
to
Robin
,
to
carry
me
back
,
whether
I
would
or
not
.
 
<EOS>
And
how
different
is
his
behaviour
to
that
!
 
<EOS>
And
would
it
not
look
as
if
I
was
prepossessed
,
as
he
calls
it
,
if
I
do
n't
oblige
him
;
and
as
if
it
was
a
silly
female
piece
of
pride
,
to
make
him
follow
me
to
my
father
's
;
and
as
if
I
would
use
him
hardly
in
my
turn
,
for
his
having
used
me
ill
in
his
?
 
<EOS>
Upon
the
whole
,
I
resolved
to
obey
him
;
and
if
he
uses
me
ill
afterwards
,
double
will
be
his
ungenerous
guilt
!
 
<EOS>
Though
hard
will
be
my
lot
,
to
have
my
credulity
so
justly
blamable
,
as
it
will
then
seem
.
 
<EOS>
For
,
to
be
sure
,
the
world
,
the
wise
world
,
that
never
is
wrong
itself
,
judges
always
by
events
.
 
<EOS>
And
if
he
should
use
me
ill
,
then
I
shall
be
blamed
for
trusting
him
:
<EOS>
If
well
,
O
then
I
did
right
,
to
be
sure
!
 
<EOS>
But
how
would
my
censurers
act
in
my
case
,
before
the
event
justifies
or
condemns
the
action
,
is
the
question
?
  
<EOS>
Then
I
have
no
notion
of
obliging
by
halves
;
but
of
doing
things
with
a
grace
,
as
one
may
say
,
where
they
are
to
be
done
;
and
so
I
wrote
the
desired
letter
to
you
,
assuring
you
,
that
I
had
before
me
happier
prospects
than
ever
I
had
;
and
hoped
all
would
end
well
:
And
that
I
begged
you
would
send
me
,
by
the
bearer
,
Mr.
Thomas
,
my
master
's
groom
,
those
papers
,
which
I
had
sent
you
by
Mr.
Williams
's
conveyance
:
For
that
they
imported
me
much
,
for
clearing
up
a
point
in
my
conduct
,
that
my
master
was
desirous
to
know
,
before
he
resolved
to
favour
me
,
as
he
had
intended
.
 
<EOS>
But
you
will
have
that
letter
,
before
you
can
have
this
;
for
I
would
not
send
you
this
without
the
preceding
;
which
now
is
in
my
master
's
hands
.
  
<EOS>
And
so
,
having
given
the
letter
to
Mr.
Thomas
for
him
to
carry
to
you
,
when
he
had
baited
and
rested
after
his
great
fatigue
,
I
sent
for
Monsieur
Colbrand
,
and
Robin
,
and
gave
to
the
former
his
letter
;
and
when
he
had
read
it
,
I
said
,
You
see
how
things
stand
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
resolved
to
return
to
our
master
;
and
as
he
is
not
so
well
as
were
to
be
wished
,
the
more
haste
you
make
the
better
:
and
do
n't
mind
my
fatigue
,
but
consider
only
yourselves
,
and
the
horses
.
 
<EOS>
Robin
,
who
guessed
the
matter
,
by
his
conversation
with
Thomas
,
(
as
I
suppose
,
)
said
,
God
bless
you
,
madam
,
and
reward
you
,
as
your
obligingness
to
my
good
master
deserves
;
and
may
we
all
live
to
see
you
triumph
over
Mrs.
Jewkes
!
  
<EOS>
I
wondered
to
hear
him
say
so
;
for
I
was
always
careful
of
exposing
my
master
,
or
even
that
naughty
woman
,
before
the
common
servants
.
 
<EOS>
But
yet
I
question
whether
Robin
would
have
said
this
,
if
he
had
not
guessed
,
by
Thomas
's
message
,
and
my
resolving
to
return
,
that
I
might
stand
well
with
his
master
.
 
<EOS>
So
selfish
are
the
hearts
of
poor
mortals
,
that
they
are
ready
to
change
as
favour
goes
!
  
<EOS>
So
they
were
not
long
getting
ready
;
and
I
am
just
setting
out
,
back
again
:
and
<EOS>
I
hope
I
shall
have
no
reason
to
repent
it
.
  
<EOS>
Robin
put
on
very
vehemently
;
and
when
we
came
to
the
little
town
,
where
we
lay
on
Sunday
night
,
he
gave
his
horses
a
bait
,
and
said
,
he
would
push
for
his
master
's
that
night
,
as
it
would
be
moon
-
light
,
if
I
should
not
be
too
much
fatigued
because
there
was
no
place
between
that
and
the
town
adjacent
to
his
master
's
,
fit
to
put
up
at
,
for
the
night
.
 
<EOS>
But
Monsieur
Colbrand
's
horse
beginning
to
give
way
,
made
a
doubt
between
them
:
wherefore
<EOS>
I
said
,
(
hating
to
be
on
the
road
,
)
if
it
could
be
done
,
I
should
bear
it
well
enough
,
I
hoped
;
and
that
Monsieur
Colbrand
might
leave
his
horse
,
when
it
failed
,
at
some
house
,
and
come
into
the
chariot
.
 
<EOS>
This
pleased
them
both
;
and
,
about
twelve
miles
short
,
he
left
the
horse
,
and
took
off
his
spurs
and
holsters
,
etc
.
<EOS>
and
,
with
abundance
of
ceremonial
excuses
,
came
into
the
chariot
;
and
I
sat
the
easier
for
it
;
for
my
bones
ached
sadly
with
the
jolting
,
and
so
many
miles
travelling
in
so
few
hours
,
as
I
have
done
,
from
Sunday
night
,
five
o'clock
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
for
all
this
,
it
was
eleven
o'clock
at
night
,
when
we
came
to
the
village
adjacent
to
my
master
's
;
and
the
horses
began
to
be
very
much
tired
,
and
Robin
too
:
<EOS>
but
I
said
,
It
would
be
pity
to
put
up
only
three
miles
short
of
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
So
about
one
we
reached
the
gate
;
but
every
body
was
a
-
bed
.
 
<EOS>
But
one
of
the
helpers
got
the
keys
from
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
and
opened
the
gates
;
and
the
horses
could
hardly
crawl
into
the
stable
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
,
when
I
went
to
get
out
of
the
chariot
,
fell
down
,
and
thought
I
had
lost
the
use
of
my
limbs
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
came
down
with
her
clothes
huddled
on
,
and
lifted
up
her
hands
and
eyes
,
at
my
return
;
but
shewed
more
care
of
the
horses
than
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
By
that
time
the
two
maids
came
;
and
I
made
shift
to
creep
in
,
as
well
as
I
could
.
  
<EOS>
It
seems
my
poor
master
was
very
ill
indeed
,
and
had
been
upon
the
bed
most
part
of
the
day
;
and
Abraham
(
who
succeeded
John
)
sat
up
with
him
.
<EOS>
And
he
was
got
into
a
fine
sleep
,
and
heard
not
the
coach
come
in
,
nor
the
noise
we
made
;
for
his
chamber
lies
towards
the
garden
,
 
on
the
other
side
of
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
said
,
He
had
a
feverish
complaint
,
and
had
been
blooded
;
and
,
very
prudently
,
ordered
Abraham
,
when
he
awaked
,
not
to
tell
him
I
was
come
,
for
fear
of
surprising
him
,
and
augmenting
his
fever
;
nor
,
indeed
,
to
say
any
thing
of
me
,
till
she
herself
broke
it
to
him
in
the
morning
,
as
she
should
see
how
he
was
.
  
<EOS>
So
I
went
to
bed
with
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
after
she
had
caused
me
to
drink
almost
half
a
pint
of
burnt
wine
,
made
very
rich
and
cordial
,
with
spices
;
<EOS>
which
I
found
very
refreshing
,
and
set
me
into
a
sleep
I
little
hoped
for
.
  
<EOS>
Tuesday
morning
.
  
<EOS>
Getting
up
pretty
early
,
I
have
written
thus
far
,
while
Mrs.
Jewkes
lies
snoring
in
bed
,
fetching
up
her
last
night
's
disturbance
.
 
<EOS>
I
long
for
her
rising
,
to
know
how
my
poor
master
does
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
well
for
her
she
can
sleep
so
purely
.
 
<EOS>
No
love
,
but
for
herself
,
will
ever
break
her
rest
,
I
am
sure
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
deadly
sore
all
over
,
as
if
I
had
been
soundly
beaten
.
 
<EOS>
I
did
not
think
I
could
have
lived
under
such
fatigue
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
as
soon
as
she
got
up
,
went
to
know
how
my
master
did
,
and
he
had
had
a
good
night
;
and
,
having
drank
plentifully
of
sack
whey
,
had
sweated
much
;
so
that
his
fever
had
abated
considerably
.
 
<EOS>
She
said
to
him
,
that
he
must
not
be
surprised
,
and
she
would
tell
him
news
.
 
<EOS>
He
asked
,
<EOS>
What
?
 
<EOS>
And
she
said
,
I
was
come
.
 
<EOS>
He
raised
himself
up
in
his
bed
;
Can
it
be
?
<EOS>
said
he
 
<EOS>
What
,
already
!
 
<EOS>
She
told
him
I
came
last
night
.
<EOS>
Monsieur
Colbrand
coming
to
inquire
of
his
health
,
he
ordered
him
to
draw
near
him
,
and
was
highly
pleased
with
the
account
he
gave
him
of
the
journey
,
my
readiness
to
come
back
,
and
my
willingness
to
reach
home
that
night
.
 
<EOS>
And
he
said
,
Why
,
these
tender
fair
ones
,
I
think
,
bear
fatigue
better
than
us
men
.
 
<EOS>
But
she
is
very
good
,
to
give
me
such
an
instance
of
her
readiness
to
oblige
me
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
said
he
,
take
great
care
of
her
health
!
<EOS>
and
let
her
be
a
-
bed
all
day
.
 
<EOS>
She
told
him
I
had
been
up
these
two
hours
.
 
<EOS>
Ask
her
,
said
he
,
if
she
will
be
so
good
as
to
make
me
a
visit
:
If
she
wo
n't
,
I
'll
rise
,
and
go
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
sir
,
said
she
,
you
must
be
still
;
and
I
'll
go
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
But
do
n't
urge
her
too
much
,
said
he
,
if
she
be
unwilling
.
  
<EOS>
She
came
to
me
,
and
told
me
all
the
above
;
and
I
said
,
I
would
most
willingly
wait
upon
him
;
for
,
indeed
,
I
longed
to
see
him
,
and
was
much
grieved
he
was
so
ill
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
went
down
with
her
.
 
<EOS>
Will
she
come
?
<EOS>
said
he
,
as
I
entered
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
sir
,
said
we
;
and
she
said
,
at
the
first
word
,
Most
willingly
.
 
<EOS>
Sweet
excellence
!
<EOS>
said
he
.
  
<EOS>
As
soon
as
he
saw
me
,
he
said
,
O
my
beloved
Pamela
!
<EOS>
you
have
made
me
quite
well
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
concerned
to
return
my
acknowledgments
to
you
in
so
unfit
a
place
and
manner
;
but
will
you
give
me
your
hand
?
 
<EOS>
I
did
,
and
he
kissed
it
with
great
eagerness
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
said
I
,
you
do
me
too
much
honour
!
  
<EOS>
I
 
am
sorry
you
are
so
ill
.
 
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
be
ill
,
said
he
,
while
you
are
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
very
well
already
.
  
<EOS>
Well
,
said
he
,
and
kissed
my
hand
again
<EOS>
,
you
shall
not
repent
this
goodness
.
 
<EOS>
My
heart
is
too
full
of
it
to
express
myself
as
I
ought
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
am
sorry
you
have
had
such
a
fatiguing
time
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
Life
is
no
life
without
you
!
 
<EOS>
If
you
had
refused
me
,
and
yet
I
had
hardly
hopes
you
would
oblige
me
<EOS>
,
I
should
have
had
a
severe
fit
of
it
,
I
believe
;
for
I
was
taken
very
oddly
,
and
knew
not
what
to
make
of
myself
:
but
now
I
shall
be
well
instantly
.
 
<EOS>
You
need
not
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
added
he
,
send
for
the
doctor
from
Stamford
,
as
we
talked
yesterday
;
for
this
lovely
creature
is
my
doctor
,
as
her
absence
was
my
disease
.
  
<EOS>
He
begged
me
to
sit
down
by
his
bed
-
side
,
and
asked
me
,
if
I
had
obliged
him
with
sending
for
my
former
packet
?
 
<EOS>
I
said
I
had
,
and
hoped
it
would
be
brought
.
 
<EOS>
He
said
it
was
doubly
kind
.
  
<EOS>
I
would
not
stay
long
because
of
disturbing
him
.
 
<EOS>
And
he
got
up
in
the
afternoon
,
and
desired
my
company
;
and
seemed
quite
pleased
,
easy
,
and
much
better
.
 
<EOS>
He
said
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
after
this
instance
of
my
good
Pamela
's
obligingness
in
her
return
,
I
am
sure
we
ought
to
leave
her
entirely
at
her
own
liberty
;
and
pray
,
if
she
pleases
to
take
a
turn
in
our
chariot
,
or
in
the
garden
,
or
to
the
town
,
or
wherever
she
will
,
let
her
be
left
at
liberty
,
and
asked
no
questions
;
and
do
you
do
all
in
your
power
to
oblige
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
said
she
would
,
to
be
sure
.
  
<EOS>
He
took
my
hand
,
and
said
,
One
thing
I
will
tell
you
,
Pamela
,
because
I
know
you
will
be
glad
to
hear
it
,
and
yet
not
care
to
ask
me
:
<EOS>
I
had
,
before
you
went
,
taken
Williams
's
bond
for
the
money
;
for
how
the
poor
man
had
behaved
I
ca
n't
tell
,
but
he
could
get
no
bail
;
and
if
I
have
no
fresh
reason
given
me
,
perhaps
I
shall
not
exact
the
payment
;
and
he
has
been
some
time
at
liberty
,
and
now
follows
his
school
;
but
,
methinks
<EOS>
,
I
could
wish
you
would
not
see
him
at
present
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
,
said
I
,
I
will
not
do
any
thing
to
disoblige
you
wilfully
;
and
I
am
glad
he
is
at
liberty
,
because
I
was
the
occasion
of
his
misfortunes
.
 
<EOS>
I
durst
say
no
more
,
though
I
wanted
to
plead
for
the
poor
gentleman
;
<EOS>
which
,
in
gratitude
,
I
thought
I
ought
,
when
I
could
do
him
service
.
 
<EOS>
I
said
,
I
am
sorry
,
sir
,
Lady
Davers
,
who
loves
you
so
well
,
should
have
incurred
your
displeasure
,
and
that
there
should
be
any
variance
between
your
honour
and
her
<EOS>
;
I
hope
it
was
not
on
my
account
.
 
<EOS>
He
took
out
of
his
waistcoat
pocket
,
as
he
sat
in
his
gown
,
his
letter
-
case
,
and
said
,
Here
,
<EOS>
Pamela
,
read
that
when
you
go
up
stairs
,
and
let
me
have
your
thoughts
upon
it
;
and
that
will
let
you
into
the
affair
.
  
<EOS>
He
said
he
was
very
heavy
of
a
sudden
,
and
would
lie
down
,
and
indulge
for
that
day
;
and
if
he
was
better
in
the
morning
,
would
take
an
airing
in
the
chariot
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
I
took
my
leave
for
the
present
,
and
went
up
to
my
closet
,
and
read
the
letter
he
was
pleased
to
put
into
my
hands
;
which
is
as
follows
:
    
"
BROTHER
,
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
uneasy
at
what
I
hear
of
you
;
and
must
write
,
whether
it
please
you
or
not
,
my
full
mind
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
had
some
people
with
me
,
desiring
me
to
interpose
with
you
;
and
they
have
a
greater
regard
for
your
honour
,
than
,
I
am
sorry
to
say
it
,
you
have
yourself
.
 
<EOS>
Could
I
think
,
that
a
brother
of
mine
would
so
meanly
run
away
with
my
late
dear
mother
's
waiting
-
maid
,
and
keep
her
a
prisoner
from
all
her
friends
,
and
to
the
disgrace
of
your
own
?
 
<EOS>
But
I
thought
,
when
you
would
not
let
the
wench
come
to
me
on
my
mother
's
death
,
that
you
meant
no
good
.
 
<EOS>
I
blush
for
you
,
I
'll
assure
you
.
 
<EOS>
The
girl
was
an
innocent
,
good
girl
;
but
I
suppose
that
's
over
with
her
now
,
or
soon
will
.
 
<EOS>
What
can
you
mean
by
this
,
let
me
ask
you
?
 
<EOS>
Either
you
will
have
her
for
a
kept
mistress
,
or
for
a
wife
.
 
<EOS>
If
the
former
,
there
are
enough
to
be
had
without
ruining
a
poor
wench
that
my
mother
loved
,
and
who
really
was
a
very
good
girl
:
<EOS>
and
of
this
you
may
be
ashamed
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
the
other
,
I
dare
say
you
do
n't
think
of
it
;
but
if
you
should
,
you
would
be
utterly
inexcusable
.
 
<EOS>
Consider
,
brother
,
<EOS>
that
ours
is
no
upstart
family
;
but
is
as
ancient
as
the
best
in
the
kingdom
!
<EOS>
and
,
for
several
hundreds
of
years
,
it
has
never
been
known
,
that
the
heirs
of
it
have
disgraced
themselves
by
unequal
matches
:
<EOS>
And
you
know
you
have
been
sought
to
by
some
of
the
best
families
in
the
nation
,
for
your
alliance
.
 
<EOS>
It
might
be
well
enough
,
if
you
were
descended
of
a
family
of
yesterday
,
or
but
a
remove
or
two
from
the
dirt
you
seem
so
fond
of
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
let
me
tell
you
,
that
I
,
and
all
mine
,
will
renounce
you
for
ever
,
if
you
can
descend
so
meanly
;
and
I
shall
be
ashamed
to
be
called
your
sister
.
 
<EOS>
A
handsome
man
,
as
you
are
,
in
your
person
;
so
happy
in
the
gifts
of
your
mind
,
that
every
body
courts
your
company
;
and
possessed
of
such
a
noble
and
clear
estate
;
and
very
rich
in
money
besides
,
left
you
by
the
best
of
fathers
and
mothers
,
with
such
ancient
blood
in
your
veins
,
untainted
!
<EOS>
for
you
to
throw
away
yourself
thus
,
is
intolerable
;
and
it
would
be
very
wicked
in
you
to
ruin
the
wench
too
.
 
<EOS>
So
that
I
beg
you
will
restore
her
to
her
parents
,
and
give
her
100l
.
<EOS>
or
so
,
to
make
her
happy
in
some
honest
fellow
of
her
own
degree
;
and
that
will
be
doing
something
,
and
will
also
oblige
and
pacify
                                        
"
Your
much
grieved
sister
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
have
written
too
sharply
,
consider
it
is
my
love
to
you
,
and
the
shame
you
are
bringing
upon
yourself
;
and
I
wish
this
may
have
the
effect
upon
you
,
intended
by
your
very
loving
sister
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
is
a
sad
letter
,
my
dear
father
and
mother
;
and
one
may
see
how
poor
people
are
despised
by
the
proud
and
the
rich
!
<EOS>
and
yet
we
were
all
on
a
foot
originally
:
<EOS>
And
many
of
these
gentry
,
that
brag
of
their
ancient
blood
,
would
be
glad
to
have
it
as
wholesome
,
and
as
really
untainted
,
as
ours
!
 
<EOS>
Surely
these
proud
people
never
think
what
a
short
stage
life
is
;
and
that
,
with
all
their
vanity
;
a
time
is
coming
,
when
they
shall
be
obliged
to
submit
to
be
on
a
level
with
us
:
And
true
said
the
philosopher
,
when
he
looked
upon
the
skull
of
a
king
,
and
that
of
a
poor
man
,
that
he
saw
no
difference
between
them
.
 
<EOS>
Besides
,
do
they
not
know
,
that
the
richest
of
princes
,
and
the
poorest
of
beggars
,
are
to
have
one
great
and
tremendous
judge
,
at
the
last
day
;
who
will
not
distinguish
between
them
,
according
to
their
circumstances
in
life
?
 
<EOS>
But
,
on
the
contrary
,
may
make
their
condemnations
the
greater
,
as
their
neglected
opportunities
were
the
greater
?
 
<EOS>
Poor
souls
!
<EOS>
how
do
I
pity
their
pride
!
  
<EOS>
O
keep
me
,
Heaven
!
<EOS>
from
their
high
condition
,
if
my
mind
shall
ever
be
tainted
with
their
vice
!
<EOS>
or
polluted
with
so
cruel
and
inconsiderate
a
contempt
of
the
humble
estate
which
they
behold
with
so
much
scorn
!
  
<EOS>
But
,
besides
,
how
do
these
gentry
know
,
that
,
supposing
they
could
trace
back
their
ancestry
for
one
,
two
,
three
,
or
even
five
hundred
years
,
that
then
the
original
stems
of
these
poor
families
,
though
they
have
not
kept
such
elaborate
records
of
their
good
-
for
nothingness
,
as
it
often
proves
,
were
not
still
deeper
rooted
?
 
<EOS>
And
how
can
they
be
assured
,
that
one
hundred
years
hence
,
or
two
,
some
of
those
now
despised
upstart
families
may
not
revel
in
their
estates
,
while
their
descendants
may
be
reduced
to
the
others
'
dunghills
!
 
<EOS>
And
,
perhaps
,
such
is
the
vanity
,
as
well
as
changeableness
,
of
human
estates
,
in
their
turns
set
up
for
pride
of
family
,
and
despise
the
others
!
  
<EOS>
These
reflections
occurred
to
my
thoughts
,
made
serious
by
my
master
's
indisposition
,
and
this
proud
letter
of
the
lowly
Lady
Davers
,
against
the
high
-
minded
Pamela
.
 
<EOS>
Lowly
,
I
say
,
because
she
could
stoop
to
such
vain
pride
;
and
high
-
minded
I
,
because
I
hope
I
am
too
proud
ever
to
do
the
like
!
 
<EOS>
But
,
after
all
,
poor
wretches
that
we
be
!
<EOS>
we
scarce
know
what
we
are
,
much
less
what
we
shall
be
!
 
<EOS>
But
,
once
more
pray
I
to
be
kept
from
the
sinful
pride
of
a
high
estate
.
  
<EOS>
On
this
occasion
I
recall
the
following
lines
,
which
I
have
read
;
where
the
poet
argues
in
a
much
better
manner
:
        
"
 
W
ise
Providence
     
<EOS>
Does
various
parts
for
various
minds
dispense
:
     
<EOS>
The
meanest
slaves
,
or
those
who
hedge
and
ditch
<EOS>
,
     
Are
useful
,
by
their
sweat
,
to
feed
the
rich
.
     
<EOS>
The
rich
,
in
due
return
,
impart
their
store
;
     
Which
comfortably
feeds
the
lab'ring
poor
.
     
<EOS>
Nor
let
the
rich
the
lowest
slave
disdain
:
     
<EOS>
He
's
equally
a
link
of
Nature
's
chain
:
     
Labours
to
the
same
end
,
joins
in
one
view
;
     
And
both
alike
the
will
divine
pursue
;
     
And
,
at
the
last
,
are
levell'd
,
king
and
slave
,
     
<EOS>
Without
distinction
,
in
the
silent
grave
.
"
  
<EOS>
Wednesday
morning
.
  
<EOS>
My
master
sent
me
a
message
just
now
,
that
he
was
so
much
better
,
that
he
would
take
a
turn
,
after
breakfast
,
in
the
chariot
,
and
would
have
me
give
him
my
company
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
I
shall
know
how
to
be
humble
,
and
comport
myself
as
I
should
do
,
under
all
these
favours
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
is
one
of
the
most
obliging
creatures
in
the
world
;
and
I
have
such
respects
shewn
me
by
every
one
,
as
if
I
was
as
great
as
Lady
Davers
 
<EOS>
But
now
,
if
this
should
all
end
in
the
sham
-
marriage
!
 
<EOS>
It
can
not
be
,
I
hope
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
the
pride
of
greatness
and
ancestry
,
and
such
-
like
,
is
so
strongly
set
out
in
Lady
Davers
's
letter
,
that
I
can
not
flatter
myself
to
be
so
happy
as
all
these
desirable
appearances
make
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
Should
I
be
now
deceived
,
I
should
be
worse
off
than
ever
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
shall
see
what
light
this
new
honour
will
procure
me
!
 
<EOS>
So
I
'll
get
ready
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
wo
n't
,
I
think
,
change
my
garb
.
 
<EOS>
Should
I
do
it
<EOS>
,
it
would
look
as
if
I
would
be
nearer
on
a
level
with
him
:
and
yet
,
<EOS>
should
I
not
,
it
might
be
thought
a
disgrace
to
him
:
but
I
will
,
I
think
,
open
the
portmanteau
,
and
,
for
the
first
time
since
I
came
hither
,
put
on
my
best
silk
nightgown
.
 
<EOS>
But
then
that
will
be
making
myself
a
sort
of
right
to
the
clothes
I
had
renounced
;
and
I
am
not
yet
quite
sure
I
shall
have
no
other
crosses
to
encounter
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
will
go
as
I
am
;
for
,
though
ordinary
,
I
am
as
clean
as
a
penny
,
though
I
say
it
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
'll
e'en
go
as
I
am
,
except
he
orders
otherwise
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
Mrs.
Jewkes
says
,
I
ought
to
dress
as
fine
as
I
can
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
say
,
I
think
not
.
 
<EOS>
As
my
master
is
up
,
and
at
breakfast
,
I
will
venture
down
to
ask
him
how
he
will
have
me
be
.
  
<EOS>
Well
,
he
is
kinder
and
kinder
,
and
,
thank
God
,
purely
recovered
!
 
<EOS>
How
charmingly
he
looks
,
to
what
he
did
yesterday
!
 
<EOS>
Blessed
be
God
for
it
!
  
<EOS>
He
arose
,
and
came
to
me
,
and
took
me
by
the
hand
,
and
would
set
me
down
by
him
;
and
he
said
,
My
charming
girl
seemed
going
to
speak
.
 
<EOS>
What
would
you
say
?
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
said
I
,
(
a
little
ashamed
,
)
<EOS>
I
think
it
is
too
great
an
honour
to
go
into
the
chariot
with
you
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
my
dear
Pamela
,
said
he
;
the
pleasure
of
your
company
will
be
greater
than
the
honour
of
mine
;
and
so
say
no
more
on
that
head
.
  
<EOS>
But
,
sir
,
said
I
,
I
shall
disgrace
you
to
go
thus
.
 
<EOS>
You
would
grace
a
prince
,
my
fair
-
one
,
said
the
good
,
kind
,
kind
gentleman
!
<EOS>
in
that
dress
,
or
any
you
shall
choose
:
<EOS>
And
you
look
so
pretty
,
that
,
if
you
shall
not
catch
cold
in
that
round
-
eared
cap
,
you
shall
go
just
as
you
are
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
sir
,
said
I
,
then
you
'll
be
pleased
to
go
a
bye
-
way
,
that
it
may
n't
be
seen
you
do
so
much
honor
to
your
servant
.
 
<EOS>
O
my
good
girl
!
<EOS>
said
he
,
<EOS>
I
doubt
you
are
afraid
of
yourself
being
talked
of
,
more
than
me
:
<EOS>
for
I
hope
by
degrees
to
take
off
the
world
's
wonder
,
and
teach
them
to
expect
what
is
to
follow
,
as
a
due
to
my
Pamela
.
  
<EOS>
O
the
dear
good
man
!
 
<EOS>
There
's
for
you
,
my
dear
father
and
mother
!
 
<EOS>
Did
I
not
do
well
now
to
come
back
?
 
<EOS>
O
could
I
get
rid
of
my
fears
of
this
sham
-
marriage
,
(
for
all
this
is
not
yet
inconsistent
with
that
frightful
scheme
,
)
<EOS>
I
should
be
too
happy
!
  
<EOS>
So
I
came
up
,
with
great
pleasure
,
for
my
gloves
:
and
now
wait
his
kind
commands
.
 
<EOS>
Dear
,
dear
sir
!
<EOS>
said
I
to
myself
,
as
if
I
was
speaking
to
him
,
for
God
's
sake
<EOS>
let
me
have
no
more
trials
and
reverses
;
for
I
could
not
bear
it
now
,
I
verily
think
!
  
<EOS>
At
last
the
welcome
message
came
,
that
my
master
was
ready
;
and
so
I
went
down
as
fast
as
I
could
;
and
he
,
before
all
the
servants
,
handed
me
in
,
as
if
I
was
a
lady
;
and
then
came
in
himself
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
begged
he
would
take
care
<EOS>
he
did
not
catch
cold
,
as
he
had
been
ill
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
had
the
pride
to
hear
his
new
coachman
say
,
to
one
of
his
fellow
-
servants
,
They
are
a
charming
pair
,
I
am
sure
!
'
<EOS>
tis
pity
they
should
be
parted
!
 
<EOS>
O
my
dear
father
and
mother
!
 
<EOS>
I
fear
your
girl
will
grow
as
proud
as
any
thing
!
 
<EOS>
And
,
especially
,
you
will
think
I
have
reason
to
guard
against
it
,
when
you
read
the
kind
particulars
I
am
going
to
relate
.
  
<EOS>
He
ordered
dinner
to
be
ready
by
two
;
and
Abraham
,
who
succeeds
John
,
went
behind
the
coach
.
 
<EOS>
He
bid
Robin
drive
gently
,
and
told
me
,
he
wanted
to
talk
to
me
about
his
sister
Davers
,
and
other
matters
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
at
first
setting
out
he
kissed
me
a
little
too
often
,
that
he
did
;
and
I
was
afraid
of
Robin
's
looking
back
,
through
the
fore
-
glass
,
and
people
seeing
us
,
as
they
passed
;
but
he
was
exceedingly
kind
to
me
,
in
his
words
,
as
well
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
,
he
said
,
  
You
have
,
I
doubt
not
,
read
,
over
and
over
,
my
sister
's
saucy
letter
;
and
find
,
as
I
told
you
,
that
you
are
no
more
obliged
to
her
than
I
am
.
 
<EOS>
You
see
she
intimates
,
that
some
people
had
been
with
her
;
and
who
should
they
be
,
but
the
officious
Mrs.
Jervis
,
and
Mr.
Longman
,
and
Jonathan
!
<EOS>
and
so
that
has
made
me
take
the
measures
I
did
in
dismissing
them
my
service
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
,
said
he
,
you
are
going
to
speak
on
their
behalfs
;
but
your
time
is
not
come
to
do
that
,
if
ever
I
shall
permit
it
.
  
<EOS>
My
sister
,
says
he
,
I
have
been
beforehand
with
;
for
I
have
renounced
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
sure
I
have
been
a
kind
brother
to
her
;
and
gave
her
to
the
value
of
3000l
.
<EOS>
more
than
her
share
came
to
by
my
father
's
will
,
when
I
entered
upon
my
estate
.
 
<EOS>
And
the
woman
,
surely
,
was
beside
herself
with
passion
and
insolence
,
<EOS>
when
she
wrote
me
such
a
letter
;
for
well
she
knew
I
would
not
bear
it
.
 
<EOS>
But
you
must
know
,
Pamela
,
that
she
is
much
incensed
,
that
I
will
give
no
ear
to
a
proposal
of
hers
,
of
a
daughter
of
my
Lord
#
#
#
#
,
 
<EOS>
who
,
said
he
,
neither
in
person
,
or
mind
,
or
acquirements
,
even
with
all
her
opportunities
,
is
to
be
named
in
a
day
with
my
Pamela
.
<EOS>
But
yet
you
see
the
plea
,
my
girl
,
which
I
made
to
you
before
,
of
the
pride
of
condition
,
and
the
world
's
censure
,
which
,
I
own
,
sticks
a
little
too
close
with
me
still
:
for
a
woman
shines
not
forth
to
the
public
as
man
;
and
the
world
sees
not
your
excellencies
and
perfections
:
<EOS>
If
it
did
,
I
should
entirely
stand
acquitted
by
the
severest
censures
.
<EOS>
But
it
will
be
taken
in
the
lump
;
that
here
is
Mr.
B
#
#
#
#
,
with
such
and
such
an
estate
,
has
married
his
mother
's
waiting
-
maid
:
not
considering
there
is
not
a
lady
in
the
kingdom
that
can
out
-
do
her
,
or
better
support
the
condition
to
which
she
will
be
raised
,
if
I
should
marry
her
.
 
<EOS>
And
,
said
he
,
putting
his
arm
round
me
,
and
again
kissing
me
<EOS>
,
I
pity
my
dear
girl
too
,
for
her
part
in
this
censure
;
for
,
here
will
she
have
to
combat
the
pride
and
slights
of
the
neighbouring
gentry
all
around
us
.
 
<EOS>
Sister
Davers
,
you
see
,
will
never
be
reconciled
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
The
other
ladies
will
not
visit
you
;
and
you
will
,
with
a
merit
superior
to
them
all
,
be
treated
as
if
unworthy
their
notice
.
 
<EOS>
Should
I
now
marry
my
Pamela
,
how
will
my
girl
relish
all
this
?
 
<EOS>
Wo
n't
these
be
cutting
things
to
my
fair
-
one
?
<EOS>
For
,
as
to
me
,
I
shall
have
nothing
to
do
,
but
,
with
a
good
estate
in
possession
,
to
brazen
out
the
matter
of
my
former
pleasantry
on
this
subject
,
with
my
companions
of
the
chase
,
the
green
,
and
the
assemblee
;
stand
their
rude
jests
for
once
or
twice
,
and
my
fortune
will
create
me
always
respect
enough
,
I
warrant
you
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
I
say
,
what
will
my
poor
girl
do
,
as
to
her
part
,
with
her
own
sex
?
 
<EOS>
For
some
company
you
must
keep
.
<EOS>
My
station
will
not
admit
it
to
be
with
my
servants
;
and
the
ladies
will
fly
your
acquaintance
;
and
still
,
though
my
wife
,
will
treat
you
as
my
mother
's
waiting
-
maid
.
 
<EOS>
What
says
my
girl
to
this
?
  
<EOS>
You
may
well
guess
,
my
dear
father
and
mother
,
how
transporting
these
kind
,
these
generous
and
condescending
sentiments
were
to
me
!
 
<EOS>
I
thought
I
had
the
harmony
of
the
spheres
all
around
me
;
and
every
word
that
dropped
from
his
lips
was
as
sweet
as
the
honey
of
Hybla
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
sir
,
said
I
,
how
inexpressibly
kind
and
good
is
all
this
!
 
<EOS>
Your
poor
servant
has
a
much
greater
struggle
than
this
to
go
through
,
a
more
knotty
difficulty
to
overcome
.
  
<EOS>
What
is
that
?
<EOS>
said
he
,
a
little
impatiently
:
<EOS>
I
will
not
forgive
your
doubts
now
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
sir
,
said
I
,
I
can
not
doubt
;
but
it
is
,
how
I
shall
support
,
how
I
shall
deserve
your
goodness
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
Dear
girl
!
<EOS>
said
he
,
and
hugged
me
to
his
breast
<EOS>
,
I
was
afraid
you
would
have
made
me
angry
again
;
but
that
I
would
not
be
,
because
I
see
you
have
a
grateful
heart
;
and
this
your
kind
and
cheerful
return
,
after
such
cruel
usage
as
you
had
experienced
in
my
house
,
enough
to
make
you
detest
the
place
,
has
made
me
resolve
to
bear
any
thing
in
you
,
but
doubts
of
my
honour
,
at
a
time
when
I
am
pouring
out
my
soul
,
with
a
true
and
affectionate
ardour
,
before
you
.
  
<EOS>
But
,
good
sir
,
said
I
,
my
greatest
concern
will
be
for
the
rude
jests
you
will
have
yourself
to
encounter
with
,
for
thus
stooping
beneath
yourself
.
<EOS>
For
,
as
to
me
,
considering
my
lowly
estate
,
and
little
merit
,
even
the
slights
and
reflections
of
the
ladies
will
be
an
honour
to
me
:
and
I
shall
have
the
pride
to
place
more
than
half
their
ill
will
to
their
envy
at
my
happiness
.
 
<EOS>
And
if
I
can
,
by
the
most
cheerful
duty
,
and
resigned
obedience
,
have
the
pleasure
to
be
agreeable
to
you
<EOS>
,
I
shall
think
myself
but
too
happy
,
let
the
world
say
what
it
will
.
  
<EOS>
He
said
,
You
are
very
good
,
<EOS>
my
dearest
girl
!
 
<EOS>
But
how
will
you
bestow
your
time
,
when
you
will
have
no
visits
to
receive
or
pay
?
 
<EOS>
No
parties
of
pleasure
to
join
in
?
 
<EOS>
No
card
-
tables
to
employ
your
winter
evenings
;
and
even
,
as
the
taste
is
,
half
the
day
,
summer
and
winter
?
 
<EOS>
And
you
have
often
played
with
my
mother
,
too
,
and
so
know
how
to
perform
a
part
there
,
as
well
as
in
the
other
diversions
:
and
I
'll
assure
you
,
my
girl
,
I
shall
not
desire
you
to
live
without
such
amusements
,
<EOS>
as
my
wife
might
expect
,
were
I
to
marry
a
lady
of
the
first
quality
.
  
<EOS>
O
,
sir
,
said
I
,
you
are
all
goodness
!
 
<EOS>
How
shall
I
bear
it
?
 
<EOS>
But
do
you
think
,
sir
,
in
such
a
family
as
yours
,
a
person
whom
you
shall
honour
with
the
name
of
mistress
of
it
,
will
not
find
useful
employments
for
her
time
,
without
looking
abroad
for
any
others
?
  
<EOS>
In
the
first
place
,
sir
,
if
you
will
give
me
leave
,
I
will
myself
look
into
such
parts
of
the
family
economy
,
as
may
not
be
beneath
the
rank
to
which
I
shall
have
the
honour
of
being
exalted
,
if
any
such
there
can
be
;
and
this
,
I
hope
,
without
incurring
the
ill
will
of
any
honest
servant
.
  
<EOS>
Then
,
sir
,
I
will
ease
you
of
as
much
of
your
family
accounts
,
as
I
possibly
can
,
when
I
have
convinced
you
that
I
am
to
be
trusted
with
them
;
and
you
know
,
sir
,
my
late
good
lady
made
me
her
treasurer
,
her
almoner
,
and
every
thing
.
  
<EOS>
Then
,
sir
,
if
I
must
needs
be
visiting
or
visited
,
and
the
ladies
wo
n't
honour
me
so
much
,
or
even
if
they
would
now
<EOS>
and
then
,
I
will
visit
,
if
your
goodness
will
allow
me
so
to
do
,
the
sick
poor
in
the
neighbourhood
around
you
;
and
administer
to
their
wants
and
necessities
,
in
such
matters
as
may
not
be
hurtful
to
your
estate
,
but
comfortable
to
them
;
and
entail
upon
you
their
blessings
,
and
their
prayers
for
your
dear
health
and
welfare
.
  
<EOS>
Then
I
will
assist
your
housekeeper
,
as
I
used
to
do
,
in
the
making
jellies
,
comfits
,
sweetmeats
,
marmalades
,
cordials
;
and
to
pot
,
and
candy
,
and
preserve
for
the
uses
of
the
family
;
and
to
make
,
myself
,
all
the
fine
linen
of
it
for
yourself
and
me
.
  
<EOS>
Then
,
sir
,
if
you
will
sometimes
indulge
me
with
your
company
,
I
will
take
an
airing
in
your
chariot
now
and
then
:
and
when
you
shall
return
home
from
your
diversions
on
the
green
,
or
from
the
chase
,
or
where
you
shall
please
to
go
,
I
shall
have
the
pleasure
of
receiving
you
with
duty
,
and
a
cheerful
delight
;
and
,
in
your
absence
,
count
the
moments
till
you
return
;
and
you
will
,
may
be
,
fill
up
some
part
of
my
time
,
the
sweetest
by
far
!
<EOS>
with
your
agreeable
conversation
,
for
an
hour
or
two
now
and
then
;
and
be
indulgent
to
the
impertinent
overflowings
of
my
grateful
heart
,
for
all
your
goodness
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
The
breakfasting
-
time
,
the
preparations
for
dinner
,
and
sometimes
to
entertain
your
chosen
friends
,
and
the
company
you
shall
bring
home
with
you
,
gentlemen
,
if
not
ladies
,
and
the
supperings
,
will
fill
up
a
great
part
of
the
day
in
a
very
necessary
manner
.
  
<EOS>
And
,
may
be
,
sir
,
now
<EOS>
and
then
a
good
-
humoured
lady
will
drop
in
;
and
<EOS>
,
I
hope
,
if
they
do
,
I
shall
so
behave
myself
,
as
not
to
add
to
the
disgrace
you
will
have
brought
upon
yourself
:
<EOS>
for
,
indeed
,
I
will
be
very
circumspect
,
and
try
to
be
as
discreet
as
I
can
;
and
<EOS>
as
humble
too
,
as
shall
be
consistent
with
your
honour
.
  
<EOS>
Cards
,
'
tis
true
,
I
can
play
at
,
in
all
the
usual
games
that
our
sex
delight
in
;
but
this
<EOS>
I
am
not
fond
of
,
nor
shall
ever
desire
to
play
,
unless
to
induce
such
ladies
,
as
you
may
wish
to
see
,
not
to
abandon
your
house
for
want
of
an
amusement
they
are
accustomed
to
.
  
<EOS>
Music
,
which
our
good
lady
taught
me
,
will
fill
up
some
intervals
,
if
I
should
have
any
.
  
<EOS>
And
then
,
sir
,
you
know
,
I
love
reading
and
scribbling
;
and
though
all
the
latter
will
be
employed
in
the
family
accounts
,
between
the
servants
and
me
,
and
me
and
your
good
self
:
yet
reading
,
at
proper
times
,
<EOS>
will
be
a
pleasure
to
me
,
which
I
shall
be
unwilling
to
give
up
,
for
the
best
company
in
the
world
,
except
yours
.
 
<EOS>
And
,
O
sir
!
<EOS>
that
will
help
to
polish
my
mind
,
and
make
me
worthier
of
your
company
and
conversation
;
and
,
with
the
explanations
you
will
give
me
,
of
what
I
shall
not
understand
,
will
be
a
sweet
employment
,
and
improvement
too
.
  
<EOS>
But
one
thing
,
sir
,
I
ought
not
to
forget
,
because
it
is
the
chief
:
<EOS>
My
duty
to
God
will
,
I
hope
,
always
employ
some
good
portion
of
my
time
,
with
thanks
for
his
superlative
goodness
to
me
;
and
to
pray
for
you
and
myself
:
for
you
,
sir
,
for
a
blessing
on
you
,
for
your
great
goodness
to
such
an
unworthy
creature
:
for
myself
,
that
I
may
be
enabled
to
discharge
my
duty
to
you
,
and
be
found
grateful
for
all
the
blessings
I
shall
receive
at
the
hands
of
Providence
,
by
means
of
your
generosity
and
condescension
.
  
<EOS>
With
all
this
,
sir
,
said
I
,
can
you
think
I
shall
be
at
a
loss
to
pass
my
time
?
 
<EOS>
But
,
as
I
know
,
that
every
slight
to
me
,
if
I
come
to
be
so
happy
,
will
be
,
in
some
measure
,
a
slight
to
you
,
I
will
beg
of
you
,
sir
,
not
to
let
me
go
very
fine
in
dress
;
but
appear
only
so
,
as
that
you
may
not
be
ashamed
of
it
after
the
honour
I
shall
have
of
being
called
by
your
worthy
name
:
for
well
I
know
,
sir
,
that
nothing
so
much
excites
the
envy
of
my
own
sex
,
as
seeing
a
person
above
them
in
appearance
,
and
in
dress
.
<EOS>
And
that
would
bring
down
upon
me
an
hundred
saucy
things
,
and
low
-
born
brats
,
and
I
ca
n't
tell
what
!
  
<EOS>
There
I
stopped
;
for
I
had
prattled
a
great
deal
too
much
so
early
:
and
he
said
,
clasping
me
to
him
<EOS>
,
Why
stops
my
dear
Pamela
?
 
<EOS>
Why
does
she
not
proceed
?
 
<EOS>
I
could
dwell
upon
your
words
all
the
day
long
;
and
you
shall
be
the
directress
of
your
own
pleasures
,
and
your
own
time
,
so
sweetly
do
you
choose
to
employ
it
:
and
thus
shall
I
find
some
of
my
own
bad
actions
atoned
for
by
your
exemplary
goodness
,
and
God
will
bless
me
for
your
sake
.
  
<EOS>
O
,
said
he
,
what
pleasure
you
give
me
in
this
sweet
foretaste
of
my
happiness
!
 
<EOS>
I
will
now
defy
the
saucy
,
busy
censurers
of
the
world
;
and
bid
them
know
your
excellence
,
and
my
happiness
,
before
they
,
with
unhallowed
lips
,
presume
to
judge
of
my
actions
,
and
your
merit
!
 
<EOS>
And
let
me
tell
you
,
my
Pamela
,
that
I
can
add
my
hopes
of
a
still
more
pleasing
amusement
,
and
what
your
bashful
modesty
would
not
permit
you
to
hint
;
and
which
I
will
no
otherwise
touch
upon
,
lest
it
should
seem
,
to
your
nicety
,
to
detract
from
the
present
purity
of
my
good
intentions
,
than
to
say
,
I
hope
to
have
superadded
to
all
these
,
such
an
employment
,
as
will
give
me
a
view
of
perpetuating
my
happy
prospects
,
and
my
family
at
the
same
time
;
of
which
I
am
almost
the
only
male
.
  
<EOS>
I
blushed
,
I
believe
;
yet
could
not
be
displeased
at
the
decent
and
charming
manner
with
which
he
insinuated
this
distant
hope
:
<EOS>
And
oh
!
judge
for
me
,
how
my
heart
was
affected
with
all
these
things
!
  
<EOS>
He
was
pleased
to
add
another
charming
reflection
,
which
shewed
me
the
noble
sincerity
of
his
kind
professions
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
own
to
you
,
my
Pamela
,
said
he
,
that
I
love
you
with
a
purer
flame
than
ever
I
knew
in
my
whole
life
;
a
flame
to
which
I
was
a
stranger
;
and
which
commenced
for
you
in
the
garden
;
though
you
,
unkindly
,
by
your
unseasonable
doubts
,
nipped
the
opening
bud
,
while
it
was
too
tender
to
bear
the
cold
blasts
of
slight
or
negligence
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
know
more
sincere
joy
and
satisfaction
in
this
sweet
hour
's
conversation
with
you
,
than
all
the
guilty
tumults
of
my
former
passion
ever
did
,
or
(
had
even
my
attempts
succeeded
)
ever
could
have
afforded
me
.
  
<EOS>
O
,
sir
,
said
I
,
expect
not
words
from
your
poor
servant
,
equal
to
these
most
generous
professions
.
 
<EOS>
Both
the
means
,
and
the
will
<EOS>
,
I
now
see
,
are
given
to
you
,
to
lay
me
under
an
everlasting
obligation
.
 
<EOS>
How
happy
shall
I
be
,
if
,
though
I
can
not
be
worthy
of
all
this
goodness
and
condescension
,
I
can
prove
myself
not
entirely
unworthy
of
it
!
 
<EOS>
But
I
can
only
answer
for
a
grateful
heart
;
and
if
ever
I
give
you
cause
,
wilfully
,
(
and
you
will
generously
allow
for
involuntary
imperfections
,
)
to
be
disgusted
with
me
,
may
I
be
an
outcast
from
your
house
and
favour
,
and
as
much
repudiated
,
as
if
the
law
had
divorced
me
from
you
!
  
<EOS>
But
sir
,
continued
I
,
though
I
was
so
unseasonable
as
I
was
in
the
garden
<EOS>
,
you
would
,
I
flatter
myself
<EOS>
,
had
you
then
heard
me
,
have
pardoned
my
imprudence
,
and
owned
I
had
some
cause
to
fear
,
and
to
wish
to
be
with
my
poor
father
and
mother
:
and
this
I
the
rather
say
,
that
you
should
not
think
me
capable
of
returning
insolence
for
your
goodness
;
or
appearing
foolishly
ungrateful
to
you
,
when
you
was
so
kind
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
Indeed
,
Pamela
,
said
he
,
you
gave
me
great
uneasiness
;
for
I
love
you
too
well
not
to
be
jealous
of
the
least
appearance
of
your
indifference
to
me
,
or
preference
to
any
other
person
,
not
excepting
your
parents
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
This
made
me
resolve
not
to
hear
you
;
for
I
had
not
got
over
my
reluctance
to
marriage
;
and
a
little
weight
<EOS>
,
you
know
,
turns
the
scale
,
when
it
hangs
in
an
equal
balance
.
 
<EOS>
But
yet
,
you
see
,
that
though
I
could
part
with
you
,
while
my
anger
held
,
yet
the
regard
I
had
then
newly
professed
for
your
virtue
,
made
me
resolve
not
to
offer
to
violate
it
;
and
you
have
seen
likewise
,
that
the
painful
struggle
I
underwent
when
I
began
to
reflect
,
and
to
read
your
moving
journal
,
between
my
desire
to
recall
you
,
and
my
doubt
whether
you
would
return
,
(
though
yet
I
resolved
not
to
force
you
to
it
,
)
had
like
to
have
cost
me
a
severe
illness
:
but
your
kind
and
cheerful
return
has
dispelled
all
my
fears
,
and
given
me
hope
,
that
I
am
not
indifferent
to
you
;
and
you
see
how
your
presence
has
chased
away
my
illness
.
  
<EOS>
I
bless
God
for
it
,
said
I
;
but
since
you
are
so
good
as
to
encourage
me
,
and
will
not
despise
my
weakness
,
I
will
acknowledge
,
that
I
suffered
more
than
I
could
have
imagined
,
till
I
experienced
it
,
in
being
banished
your
presence
in
so
much
anger
;
and
the
more
still
was
I
affected
,
when
you
answered
the
wicked
Mrs.
Jewkes
so
generously
in
my
favour
,
at
my
leaving
your
house
.
 
<EOS>
For
this
,
sir
,
awakened
all
my
reverence
for
you
;
and
you
saw
I
could
not
forbear
,
not
knowing
what
I
did
,
to
break
boldly
in
upon
you
,
and
acknowledge
your
goodness
on
my
knees
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
true
,
my
dear
Pamela
,
said
he
,
we
have
sufficiently
tortured
one
another
;
and
the
only
comfort
that
can
result
from
it
,
will
be
,
reflecting
upon
the
matter
coolly
and
with
pleasure
,
when
all
these
storms
are
overblown
,
(
as
I
hope
they
now
are
,
)
and
we
sit
together
secured
in
each
other
's
good
opinion
,
recounting
the
uncommon
gradations
by
which
we
have
ascended
to
the
summit
of
that
felicity
,
which
I
hope
we
shall
shortly
arrive
at
.
  
<EOS>
Meantime
,
said
the
good
gentleman
,
let
me
hear
what
my
dear
girl
would
have
said
in
her
justification
,
could
I
have
trusted
myself
with
her
,
as
to
her
fears
,
and
the
reason
of
her
wishing
herself
from
me
,
at
a
time
that
I
had
begun
to
shew
my
fondness
for
her
,
in
a
manner
that
I
thought
would
have
been
agreeable
to
her
and
virtue
.
  
<EOS>
I
pulled
out
of
my
pocket
the
gipsy
letter
;
but
I
said
,
before
I
shewed
it
to
him
,
I
have
this
letter
,
sir
,
<EOS>
to
shew
you
,
as
what
,
I
believe
,
you
will
allow
must
have
given
me
the
greatest
disturbance
:
<EOS>
but
,
first
,
as
I
know
not
who
is
the
writer
,
and
it
seems
to
be
in
a
disguised
hand
,
I
would
beg
it
as
a
favour
,
that
,
if
you
guess
who
it
is
,
which
I
can
not
,
it
may
not
turn
to
their
prejudice
,
because
it
was
written
,
very
probably
,
with
no
other
view
,
than
to
serve
me
.
  
<EOS>
He
took
it
,
and
read
it
.
 
<EOS>
And
it
being
signed
Somebody
,
he
said
,
Yes
,
this
is
indeed
from
Somebody
;
and
,
disguised
as
the
hand
is
,
I
know
the
writer
:
Do
n't
you
see
,
by
the
setness
of
some
of
these
letters
,
and
a
little
secretary
cut
here
<EOS>
and
there
,
especially
in
that
c
,
and
that
r
,
that
it
is
the
hand
of
a
person
bred
in
the
law
-
way
?
 
<EOS>
Why
,
Pamela
,
said
he
,
'
tis
old
Longman
's
hand
:
an
officious
rascal
as
he
is
!
 
<EOS>
But
I
have
done
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
O
sir
,
said
I
,
it
would
be
too
insolent
in
me
to
offer
<EOS>
(
so
much
am
I
myself
overwhelmed
with
your
goodness
,
)
to
defend
any
body
that
you
are
angry
with
:
<EOS>
Yet
,
sir
,
so
far
as
they
have
incurred
your
displeasure
for
my
sake
,
and
for
no
other
want
of
duty
or
respect
,
I
could
wish
 
<EOS>
But
I
dare
not
say
more
.
  
<EOS>
But
,
said
he
,
as
to
the
letter
and
the
information
it
contains
:
<EOS>
Let
me
know
,
Pamela
,
when
you
received
this
?
 
<EOS>
On
the
Friday
,
sir
,
said
I
,
that
you
were
gone
to
the
wedding
at
Stamford
.
 
<EOS>
How
could
it
be
conveyed
to
you
,
said
he
,
unknown
to
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
when
I
gave
her
such
a
strict
charge
to
attend
you
,
and
you
had
promised
me
,
that
you
would
not
throw
yourself
in
the
way
of
such
intelligence
?
 
<EOS>
For
,
said
he
,
when
I
went
to
Stamford
,
I
knew
,
from
a
private
intimation
given
me
,
that
there
would
be
an
attempt
made
to
see
you
,
or
give
you
a
letter
,
by
somebody
,
if
not
to
get
you
away
;
but
was
not
certain
from
what
quarter
,
whether
from
my
sister
Davers
,
Mrs.
Jervis
,
Mr.
Longman
,
or
John
Arnold
,
or
your
father
;
and
as
I
was
then
but
struggling
with
myself
,
whether
to
give
way
to
my
honourable
inclinations
,
or
to
free
you
,
and
let
you
go
to
your
father
,
that
I
might
avoid
the
danger
I
found
myself
in
of
the
former
;
(
for
I
had
absolutely
resolved
never
to
wound
again
even
your
ears
with
any
proposals
of
a
contrary
nature
;
)
that
was
the
reason
I
desired
you
to
permit
Mrs.
Jewkes
to
be
so
much
on
her
guard
till
I
came
back
,
when
I
thought
I
should
have
decided
this
disputed
point
within
myself
,
between
my
pride
and
my
inclinations
.
  
<EOS>
This
,
good
sir
,
said
I
,
accounts
well
to
me
for
your
conduct
in
that
case
,
and
for
what
you
said
to
me
and
Mrs.
Jewkes
on
that
occasion
:
<EOS>
And
I
see
more
and
more
how
much
I
may
depend
upon
your
honour
and
goodness
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
will
tell
you
all
the
truth
.
 
<EOS>
And
then
I
recounted
to
him
the
whole
affair
of
the
gipsy
,
and
how
the
letter
was
put
among
the
loose
grass
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
And
he
said
,
The
man
who
thinks
a
thousand
dragons
sufficient
to
watch
a
woman
,
when
her
inclination
takes
a
contrary
bent
,
will
find
all
too
little
;
and
she
will
engage
the
stones
in
the
street
,
or
the
grass
in
the
field
,
to
act
for
her
,
and
help
on
her
correspondence
.
 
<EOS>
If
the
mind
,
said
he
,
be
not
engaged
<EOS>
,
I
see
there
is
hardly
any
confinement
sufficient
for
the
body
;
and
you
have
told
me
a
very
pretty
story
;
and
,
as
you
never
gave
me
any
reason
to
question
your
veracity
,
even
in
your
severest
trials
,
I
make
no
doubt
of
the
truth
of
what
you
have
now
mentioned
:
and
I
will
,
in
my
turn
,
give
you
such
a
proof
of
mine
,
that
you
shall
find
it
carry
a
conviction
with
it
.
  
<EOS>
You
must
know
,
then
,
my
Pamela
,
that
I
had
actually
formed
such
a
project
,
so
well
informed
was
this
old
rascally
Somebody
!
<EOS>
and
the
time
was
fixed
for
the
very
person
described
in
this
letter
to
be
here
;
and
I
had
thought
he
should
have
read
some
part
of
the
ceremony
(
as
little
as
was
possible
,
to
deceive
you
)
in
my
chamber
;
and
so
I
hoped
to
have
you
mine
upon
terms
that
then
would
have
been
much
more
agreeable
to
me
than
real
matrimony
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
did
not
in
haste
intend
you
the
mortification
of
being
undeceived
;
so
that
we
might
have
lived
for
years
,
perhaps
,
very
lovingly
together
;
and
I
had
,
at
the
same
time
,
been
at
liberty
to
confirm
or
abrogate
it
as
I
pleased
.
  
<EOS>
O
sir
,
said
I
,
I
am
out
of
breath
with
the
thoughts
of
my
danger
!
 
<EOS>
But
what
good
angel
prevented
the
execution
of
this
deep
-
laid
design
?
  
<EOS>
Why
,
your
good
angel
,
Pamela
,
said
he
;
for
when
I
began
to
consider
,
that
it
would
have
made
you
miserable
,
and
me
not
happy
;
that
if
you
should
have
a
dear
little
one
,
it
would
be
out
of
my
own
power
to
legitimate
it
,
if
I
should
wish
it
to
inherit
my
estate
;
and
that
,
as
I
am
almost
the
last
of
my
family
,
and
most
of
what
I
possess
must
descend
to
a
strange
line
,
and
disagreeable
and
unworthy
persons
;
notwithstanding
that
I
might
,
in
this
case
,
have
issue
of
my
own
body
;
when
I
further
considered
your
untainted
virtue
,
what
dangers
and
trials
you
had
undergone
by
my
means
,
and
what
a
world
of
troubles
I
had
involved
you
in
,
only
because
you
were
beautiful
and
virtuous
,
which
had
excited
all
my
passion
for
you
;
and
reflected
also
upon
your
tried
prudence
and
truth
!
 
<EOS>
I
,
though
I
doubted
not
effecting
this
my
last
plot
,
resolved
to
overcome
myself
;
and
,
however
I
might
suffer
in
struggling
with
my
affection
for
you
,
to
part
with
you
,
rather
than
to
betray
you
under
so
black
a
veil
.
 
<EOS>
Besides
,
said
he
,
<EOS>
I
remember
how
much
I
had
exclaimed
against
and
censured
an
action
of
this
kind
,
that
had
been
attributed
to
one
of
the
first
men
of
the
law
,
and
of
the
kingdom
,
as
he
afterwards
became
;
and
that
it
was
but
treading
in
a
path
that
another
had
marked
out
for
me
;
and
,
as
I
was
assured
,
with
no
great
satisfaction
to
himself
,
when
he
came
to
reflect
;
my
foolish
pride
was
a
little
piqued
with
this
,
because
I
loved
to
be
,
if
I
went
out
of
the
way
,
my
own
original
,
as
I
may
call
it
.
 
<EOS>
On
all
these
considerations
it
was
,
that
I
rejected
this
project
,
and
sent
word
to
the
person
,
that
I
had
better
considered
of
the
matter
,
and
would
not
have
him
come
,
till
he
heard
further
from
me
:
<EOS>
And
,
in
this
suspense
I
suppose
,
<EOS>
some
of
your
confederates
,
Pamela
,
(
for
we
have
been
a
couple
of
plotters
,
though
your
virtue
and
merit
have
procured
you
faithful
friends
and
partisans
,
which
my
money
and
promises
could
hardly
do
,
)
<EOS>
one
way
or
other
got
knowledge
of
it
,
and
gave
you
this
notice
;
but
,
perhaps
,
it
would
have
come
too
late
,
had
not
your
white
angel
got
the
better
of
my
black
one
,
and
inspired
me
with
resolutions
to
abandon
the
project
,
just
as
it
was
to
have
been
put
into
execution
.
 
<EOS>
But
yet
I
own
,
that
,
from
these
appearances
,
you
were
but
too
well
justified
in
your
fears
,
on
this
odd
way
of
coming
at
this
intelligence
;
and
I
have
only
one
thing
to
blame
you
for
,
that
though
I
was
resolved
not
to
hear
you
in
your
own
defence
,
yet
,
as
you
have
so
ready
a
talent
at
your
pen
,
you
might
have
cleared
your
part
of
this
matter
up
to
me
by
a
line
or
two
;
and
when
I
had
known
what
seeming
good
grounds
you
had
for
pouring
cold
water
on
a
young
flame
,
that
was
just
then
rising
to
an
honourable
expansion
,
should
not
have
imputed
it
,
as
I
was
apt
to
do
,
to
unseasonable
insult
for
my
tenderness
to
you
,
on
one
hand
;
to
perverse
nicety
,
on
the
other
;
or
to
(
what
I
was
most
alarmed
by
,
and
concerned
for
)
prepossession
for
some
other
person
:
And
this
would
have
saved
us
both
much
fatigue
,
I
of
mind
,
you
of
body
.
  
<EOS>
And
,
indeed
,
sir
,
said
I
,
of
mind
too
;
and
I
could
not
better
manifest
this
,
than
by
the
cheerfulness
with
which
I
obeyed
your
recalling
me
to
your
presence
.
  
<EOS>
Ay
,
that
,
my
dear
Pamela
,
said
he
,
and
clasped
me
in
his
arms
,
was
the
kind
,
the
inexpressibly
kind
action
,
that
has
rivetted
my
affections
to
you
,
and
obliges
me
,
in
this
free
and
unreserved
manner
,
to
pour
my
whole
soul
into
your
bosom
.
  
<EOS>
I
said
,
I
had
the
less
merit
in
this
my
return
,
because
I
was
driven
,
by
an
irresistible
impulse
to
it
;
and
could
not
help
it
,
if
I
would
.
  
<EOS>
This
,
said
he
,
(
and
honoured
me
by
kissing
my
hand
,
)
is
engaging
,
indeed
;
if
I
may
hope
,
that
my
Pamela
's
gentle
inclination
for
her
persecutor
was
the
strongest
motive
to
her
return
;
and
I
so
much
value
a
voluntary
love
in
the
person
I
would
wish
for
my
wife
,
that
I
would
have
even
prudence
and
interest
hardly
named
in
comparison
with
it
:
And
can
you
return
me
sincerely
the
honest
compliment
I
now
make
you
?
 
<EOS>
In
the
choice
I
have
made
,
it
is
impossible
I
should
have
any
view
to
my
interest
.
 
<EOS>
Love
,
true
love
,
is
the
only
motive
by
which
I
am
induced
.
 
<EOS>
And
were
I
not
what
I
am
,
could
you
give
me
the
preference
to
any
other
you
know
in
the
world
,
notwithstanding
what
has
passed
between
us
?
 
<EOS>
Why
,
said
I
,
should
your
so
much
obliged
Pamela
refuse
to
answer
this
kind
question
?
 
<EOS>
Cruel
as
I
have
thought
you
,
and
dangerous
as
your
views
to
my
honesty
have
been
;
you
,
sir
,
are
the
only
person
living
that
ever
was
more
than
indifferent
to
me
:
and
before
I
knew
this
to
be
what
I
blush
now
to
call
it
,
I
could
not
hate
you
,
or
wish
you
ill
,
though
,
from
my
soul
,
the
attempts
you
made
were
shocking
,
and
most
distasteful
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
am
satisfied
,
my
Pamela
,
said
he
;
nor
shall
I
want
to
see
those
papers
that
you
have
kindly
written
for
to
your
father
;
though
I
still
wish
to
see
them
too
,
for
the
sake
of
the
sweet
manner
in
which
you
relate
what
has
passed
,
and
to
have
before
me
the
whole
series
of
your
sufferings
,
that
I
may
learn
what
degree
of
kindness
may
be
sufficient
to
recompense
you
for
them
.
  
<EOS>
In
this
manner
,
my
dear
father
and
mother
,
did
your
happy
daughter
find
herself
blessed
by
her
generous
master
!
 
<EOS>
An
ample
recompense
for
all
her
sufferings
<EOS>
did
I
think
this
sweet
conversation
only
.
 
<EOS>
A
hundred
tender
things
he
expressed
besides
,
that
though
they
never
can
escape
my
memory
,
yet
would
be
too
tedious
to
write
down
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
how
I
blessed
God
,
and
,
I
hope
,
ever
shall
,
for
all
his
gracious
favours
to
his
unworthy
handmaid
!
<EOS>
What
a
happy
change
is
this
!
 
<EOS>
And
who
knows
<EOS>
but
my
kind
,
my
generous
master
,
may
put
it
in
my
power
,
when
he
shall
see
me
not
quite
unworthy
of
it
,
to
be
a
means
,
without
injuring
him
,
to
dispense
around
me
,
to
many
persons
,
the
happy
influences
of
the
condition
to
which
I
shall
be
,
by
his
kind
favour
,
exalted
?
 
<EOS>
Doubly
blest
shall
I
be
,
in
particular
,
if
I
can
return
the
hundredth
part
of
the
obligations
I
owe
to
such
honest
good
parents
,
to
whose
pious
instructions
and
examples
,
under
God
,
I
owe
all
my
present
happiness
,
and
future
prospects
.
 
<EOS>
O
the
joy
that
fills
my
mind
on
these
proud
hopes
!
<EOS>
on
these
delightful
prospects
!
 
<EOS>
It
is
too
mighty
for
me
,
and
I
must
sit
down
to
ponder
all
these
things
,
and
to
admire
and
bless
the
goodness
of
that
Providence
,
which
has
,
through
so
many
intricate
mazes
,
made
me
tread
the
paths
of
innocence
,
and
so
amply
rewarded
me
for
what
it
has
itself
<EOS>
enabled
me
to
do
!
 
<EOS>
All
glory
to
God
alone
be
ever
given
for
it
,
by
your
poor
enraptured
daughter
!
<EOS>
#
#
#
#
  
<EOS>
I
will
now
continue
my
most
pleasing
relation
.
  
<EOS>
As
the
chariot
was
returning
home
from
this
sweet
airing
,
he
said
,
From
all
that
has
passed
between
us
in
this
pleasing
turn
,
my
Pamela
will
see
,
and
will
believe
,
that
the
trials
of
her
virtue
are
all
over
from
me
:
<EOS>
But
,
perhaps
,
there
will
be
some
few
yet
to
come
of
her
patience
and
humility
.
 
<EOS>
For
I
have
,
at
the
earnest
importunity
of
Lady
Darnford
,
and
her
daughters
,
promised
them
a
sight
of
my
beloved
girl
:
<EOS>
And
so
I
intend
to
have
their
whole
family
,
and
Lady
Jones
,
and
Mrs.
Peters
's
family
,
to
dine
with
me
once
in
a
few
days
.
 
<EOS>
And
,
since
I
believe
you
would
hardly
choose
,
at
present
,
to
grace
the
table
on
the
occasion
,
till
you
can
do
it
in
your
own
right
<EOS>
,
I
should
be
glad
you
would
not
refuse
coming
down
to
us
if
I
should
desire
it
;
for
I
would
preface
our
nuptials
,
said
the
dear
gentleman
!
 
<EOS>
O
what
a
sweet
word
was
that
!
 
<EOS>
with
their
good
opinion
of
your
merits
:
and
to
see
you
,
and
your
sweet
manner
,
will
be
enough
for
that
purpose
;
and
so
,
by
degrees
,
prepare
my
neighbours
for
what
is
to
follow
:
And
they
already
have
your
character
from
me
,
and
are
disposed
to
admire
you
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
,
said
I
,
after
all
that
has
passed
,
I
should
be
unworthy
,
if
I
could
not
say
,
that
I
can
have
no
will
but
yours
:
<EOS>
And
however
awkwardly
I
shall
behave
in
such
company
,
weighed
down
with
a
sense
of
your
obligations
on
one
side
,
and
my
own
unworthiness
,
<EOS>
with
their
observations
on
the
other
,
I
will
not
scruple
to
obey
you
.
  
<EOS>
I
am
obliged
to
you
,
Pamela
,
said
he
,
and
pray
be
only
dressed
as
you
are
;
for
since
they
know
your
condition
,
and
I
have
told
them
the
story
of
your
present
dress
,
and
how
you
came
by
it
,
<EOS>
one
of
the
young
ladies
begs
it
as
a
favour
,
that
they
may
see
you
just
as
you
are
:
and
I
am
the
rather
pleased
it
should
be
so
,
because
they
will
perceive
you
owe
nothing
to
dress
,
but
make
a
much
better
figure
with
your
own
native
stock
of
loveliness
,
than
the
greatest
ladies
arrayed
in
the
most
splendid
attire
,
and
adorned
with
the
most
glittering
jewels
.
  
<EOS>
O
sir
,
said
I
,
your
goodness
beholds
your
poor
servant
in
a
light
greatly
beyond
her
merit
!
 
<EOS>
But
it
must
not
be
expected
,
that
others
,
ladies
especially
,
will
look
upon
me
with
your
favourable
eyes
:
<EOS>
but
,
nevertheless
,
I
should
be
best
pleased
to
wear
always
this
humble
garb
,
till
you
,
for
your
own
sake
,
shall
order
it
otherwise
:
for
,
oh
,
sir
<EOS>
,
said
I
,
I
hope
it
will
be
always
my
pride
to
glory
most
in
your
goodness
!
<EOS>
and
it
will
be
a
pleasure
to
me
to
shew
every
one
,
that
,
with
respect
to
my
happiness
in
this
life
,
I
am
entirely
the
work
of
your
bounty
;
and
to
let
the
world
see
from
what
a
lowly
original
you
have
raised
me
to
honours
,
that
the
greatest
ladies
would
rejoice
in
.
  
<EOS>
Admirable
Pamela
!
<EOS>
said
he
;
excellent
girl
!
 
<EOS>
Surely
thy
sentiments
are
superior
to
those
of
all
thy
sex
!
 
<EOS>
I
might
have
addressed
a
hundred
fine
ladies
;
but
never
,
surely
,
could
have
had
reason
to
admire
one
as
I
do
you
.
  
<EOS>
As
,
my
dear
father
and
mother
,
I
repeat
these
generous
sayings
,
only
because
they
are
the
effect
of
my
master
's
goodness
,
being
far
from
presuming
to
think
I
deserve
one
of
them
;
so
I
hope
you
will
not
attribute
it
to
my
vanity
;
for
I
do
assure
you
,
I
think
I
ought
rather
to
be
more
humble
,
as
I
am
more
obliged
:
for
it
must
be
always
a
sign
of
a
poor
condition
,
to
receive
obligations
<EOS>
one
can
not
repay
;
as
it
is
of
a
rich
mind
,
when
it
can
confer
them
without
expecting
or
needing
a
return
.
<EOS>
It
is
,
on
one
side
,
the
state
of
the
human
creature
,
compared
,
on
the
other
,
to
the
Creator
;
and
so
,
with
due
deference
,
may
his
beneficence
be
said
to
be
Godlike
,
and
that
is
the
highest
that
can
be
said
.
  
<EOS>
The
chariot
brought
us
home
at
near
the
hour
of
two
;
and
,
blessed
be
God
,
my
master
is
pure
well
,
and
cheerful
;
and
that
makes
me
hope
he
does
not
repent
him
of
his
late
generous
treatment
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
He
handed
me
out
of
the
chariot
,
and
to
the
parlour
,
with
the
same
goodness
,
that
he
shewed
when
he
put
me
into
it
,
before
several
of
the
servants
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
came
to
inquire
how
he
did
.
 
<EOS>
Quite
well
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
said
he
;
quite
well
<EOS>
:
I
thank
God
,
and
this
good
girl
,
for
it
!
 
<EOS>
I
am
glad
of
it
,
said
she
;
but
I
hope
you
are
not
the
worse
for
my
care
,
and
my
doctoring
of
you
!
 
<EOS>
No
,
<EOS>
but
the
better
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
said
he
;
you
have
much
obliged
me
by
both
.
  
<EOS>
Then
he
said
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
you
and
I
have
used
this
good
girl
very
hardly
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
afraid
,
sir
,
said
she
,
I
should
be
the
subject
of
her
complaints
.
 
<EOS>
I
assure
you
,
said
he
,
she
has
not
opened
her
lips
about
you
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
had
a
quite
different
subject
to
talk
of
;
and
I
hope
she
will
forgive
us
both
:
<EOS>
You
especially
she
must
;
because
you
have
done
nothing
but
by
my
orders
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
only
mean
,
that
the
necessary
consequence
of
those
orders
has
been
very
grievous
to
my
Pamela
:
And
now
comes
our
part
to
make
her
amends
,
if
we
can
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
,
said
she
,
I
always
said
to
madam
(
as
she
called
me
)
,
that
you
was
very
good
,
and
very
forgiving
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
said
he
,
I
have
been
stark
naught
;
and
it
is
she
,
<EOS>
I
hope
,
will
be
very
forgiving
.
 
<EOS>
But
all
this
preamble
is
to
tell
you
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
that
now
I
desire
you
'll
study
to
oblige
her
,
as
much
as
(
to
obey
me
)
<EOS>
you
was
forced
to
disoblige
her
before
.
 
<EOS>
And
you
'll
remember
,
that
in
every
thing
she
is
to
be
her
own
mistress
.
  
<EOS>
Yes
,
said
she
,
and
mine
too
<EOS>
,
I
suppose
,
sir
?
 
<EOS>
Ay
,
said
the
generous
gentleman
,
I
believe
it
will
be
so
in
a
little
time
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
said
she
,
<EOS>
I
know
how
it
will
go
with
me
!
 
<EOS>
And
so
put
her
handkerchief
to
her
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
Pamela
,
said
my
master
,
comfort
poor
Mrs.
Jewkes
.
  
<EOS>
This
was
very
generous
,
already
to
seem
to
put
her
in
my
power
:
and
I
took
her
by
the
hand
,
and
said
,
I
shall
never
take
upon
me
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
to
make
a
bad
use
of
any
opportunities
that
may
be
put
into
my
hands
by
my
generous
master
;
nor
shall
I
ever
wish
to
do
you
any
disservice
,
if
I
might
:
for
I
shall
consider
,
that
what
you
have
done
,
was
in
obedience
to
a
will
which
it
will
become
me
also
to
submit
to
<EOS>
and
so
,
if
the
effects
of
our
obedience
may
be
different
,
yet
as
they
proceed
from
one
cause
,
that
must
be
always
reverenced
by
me
.
  
<EOS>
See
there
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
said
my
master
,
we
are
both
in
generous
hands
;
and
indeed
,
if
Pamela
did
not
pardon
you
,
I
should
think
she
but
half
forgave
me
,
because
you
acted
by
my
instructions
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
said
she
,
God
bless
you
both
together
,
since
it
must
be
so
;
and
I
will
double
my
diligence
to
oblige
my
lady
,
as
I
find
she
will
soon
be
.
  
<EOS>
O
my
dear
father
and
mother
!
<EOS>
now
pray
for
me
on
another
score
;
for
fear
I
should
grow
too
proud
,
and
be
giddy
and
foolish
with
all
these
promising
things
,
so
soothing
to
the
vanity
of
my
years
and
sex
.
 
<EOS>
But
even
to
this
hour
can
I
pray
,
that
God
would
remove
from
me
all
these
delightful
prospects
,
if
they
were
likely
so
to
corrupt
my
mind
,
as
to
make
me
proud
and
vain
,
and
not
acknowledge
,
with
thankful
humility
,
the
blessed
Providence
which
has
so
visibly
conducted
me
through
the
dangerous
paths
I
have
trod
,
to
this
happy
moment
.
  
<EOS>
My
master
was
pleased
to
say
,
that
he
thought
I
might
as
well
dine
with
him
,
since
he
was
alone
:
<EOS>
But
I
begged
he
would
excuse
me
,
for
fear
,
as
I
said
,
such
excess
of
goodness
and
condescension
,
all
at
once
,
should
turn
my
head
;
 
and
that
he
would
,
by
slower
degrees
,
bring
on
my
happiness
,
lest
I
should
not
know
how
to
bear
it
.
  
<EOS>
Persons
that
doubt
themselves
,
said
he
,
seldom
do
amiss
:
<EOS>
And
if
there
was
any
fear
of
what
you
say
,
you
could
not
have
it
in
your
thoughts
:
for
none
but
the
presumptuous
,
the
conceited
,
and
the
thoughtless
,
err
capitally
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
nevertheless
,
said
he
,
I
have
such
an
opinion
of
your
prudence
,
that
I
shall
generally
think
what
you
do
right
,
because
it
is
you
that
do
it
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
,
said
I
,
your
kind
expressions
shall
not
be
thrown
away
upon
me
,
if
I
can
help
it
;
for
they
will
task
me
with
the
care
of
endeavouring
to
deserve
your
good
opinion
,
and
your
approbation
,
as
the
best
rule
of
my
conduct
.
  
<EOS>
Being
then
about
to
go
up
stairs
,
Permit
me
,
sir
,
said
I
,
(
looking
about
me
with
some
confusion
,
to
see
that
nobody
was
there
,
)
thus
on
my
knees
to
thank
you
,
as
I
often
wanted
to
do
in
the
chariot
,
for
all
your
goodness
to
me
,
which
shall
never
,
I
hope
,
be
cast
away
upon
me
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
I
had
the
boldness
to
kiss
his
hand
.
  
<EOS>
I
wonder
,
since
,
how
I
came
to
be
so
forward
.
 
<EOS>
But
what
could
I
do
?
 
<EOS>
My
poor
grateful
heart
was
like
a
too
full
river
,
which
overflows
its
banks
:
and
it
carried
away
my
fear
and
my
shamefacedness
,
as
that
does
all
before
it
on
the
surface
of
its
waters
!
  
<EOS>
He
clasped
me
in
his
arms
with
transport
,
and
condescendingly
kneeled
by
me
,
and
kissing
me
,
said
,
O
my
dear
obliging
good
girl
,
on
my
knees
,
as
you
on
yours
,
I
vow
to
you
everlasting
truth
and
fidelity
!
<EOS>
and
may
God
but
bless
us
<EOS>
both
with
half
the
pleasures
that
seem
to
be
before
us
,
and
we
shall
have
no
reason
to
envy
the
felicity
of
the
greatest
princes
!
 
<EOS>
O
sir
,
said
I
,
how
shall
I
support
so
much
goodness
!
 
<EOS>
I
am
poor
,
indeed
,
in
every
thing
,
compared
to
you
!
<EOS>
and
how
far
,
very
far
,
do
you
,
in
every
generous
way
,
leave
me
behind
you
!
  
<EOS>
He
raised
me
,
and
,
as
I
bent
towards
the
door
,
led
me
to
the
stairs
foot
,
and
,
saluting
me
there
again
,
left
me
to
go
up
to
my
closet
,
where
I
threw
myself
on
my
knees
in
raptures
of
joy
,
and
blessed
that
gracious
God
,
who
had
thus
changed
my
distress
to
happiness
,
and
so
abundantly
rewarded
me
for
all
the
sufferings
I
had
passed
through
.
 
<EOS>
And
<EOS>
oh
,
how
light
,
how
very
light
,
do
all
those
sufferings
now
appear
,
which
then
my
repining
mind
made
so
grievous
to
me
!
 
<EOS>
Hence
,
in
every
state
of
life
,
and
in
all
the
changes
and
chances
of
it
,
for
the
future
,
will
I
trust
in
Providence
,
who
knows
what
is
best
for
us
,
and
frequently
turns
the
very
evils
we
most
dread
,
to
be
the
causes
of
our
happiness
,
and
of
our
deliverance
from
greater
.
 
<EOS>
My
experiences
,
young
as
I
am
,
as
to
this
great
point
of
reliance
on
God
,
are
strong
,
though
my
judgment
in
general
may
be
weak
and
uninformed
:
but
you
'll
excuse
these
reflections
,
because
they
are
your
beloved
daughter
's
;
and
,
so
far
as
they
are
not
amiss
,
derive
themselves
from
the
benefit
of
yours
and
my
late
good
lady
's
examples
and
instructions
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
written
a
vast
deal
in
a
little
time
;
and
shall
only
say
,
to
conclude
this
delightful
Wednesday
,
That
in
the
afternoon
my
good
master
was
so
well
,
that
he
rode
out
on
horseback
,
and
came
home
about
nine
at
night
;
and
then
stepped
up
to
me
,
and
,
seeing
me
with
pen
and
ink
before
me
in
my
closet
,
said
,
I
come
only
to
tell
you
I
am
very
well
,
my
Pamela
:
<EOS>
and
since
I
have
a
letter
or
two
to
write
,
I
will
leave
you
to
proceed
in
yours
,
as
I
suppose
that
was
your
employment
,
(
for
I
had
put
by
my
papers
at
his
coming
up
,
)
and
so
he
saluted
me
,
bid
me
good
night
,
and
went
down
;
and
<EOS>
I
finished
up
to
this
place
before
I
went
to
bed
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
told
me
,
if
it
was
more
agreeable
to
me
,
she
would
he
in
another
room
;
but
I
said
,
No
thank
you
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
;
pray
let
me
have
your
company
.
<EOS>
And
she
made
me
a
fine
courtesy
,
and
thanked
me
.
 
<EOS>
How
times
are
altered
!
  
<EOS>
Thursday
.
  
<EOS>
This
morning
my
master
came
up
to
me
,
and
talked
with
me
on
various
subjects
,
for
a
good
while
together
,
in
the
most
kind
manner
.
 
<EOS>
Among
other
things
,
he
asked
me
,
if
I
chose
to
order
any
new
clothes
against
my
marriage
.
 
<EOS>
(
O
how
my
heart
flutters
when
he
mentions
this
subject
so
freely
!
)
<EOS>
I
said
,
I
left
every
thing
to
his
good
pleasure
,
only
repeated
my
request
,
for
the
reasons
aforegiven
,
that
I
might
not
be
too
fine
.
  
<EOS>
He
said
,
I
think
,
my
dear
,
it
shall
be
very
private
:
I
hope
you
are
not
afraid
of
a
sham
-
marriage
;
and
pray
get
the
service
by
heart
,
that
you
may
see
nothing
is
omitted
.
 
<EOS>
I
glowed
between
shame
and
delight
.
 
<EOS>
O
how
I
felt
my
cheeks
burn
!
  
<EOS>
I
said
,
I
feared
nothing
,
I
apprehended
nothing
,
but
my
own
unworthiness
.
<EOS>
Said
he
,
<EOS>
I
think
it
shall
be
done
within
these
fourteen
days
,
from
this
day
,
at
this
house
.
 
<EOS>
O
how
I
trembled
!
<EOS>
but
not
with
grief
,
you
may
believe
 
What
says
my
girl
?
 
<EOS>
Have
you
to
object
against
any
day
of
the
next
fourteen
:
because
my
affairs
require
me
to
go
to
my
other
house
,
and
I
think
not
to
stir
from
this
till
I
am
happy
with
you
?
  
<EOS>
I
have
no
will
<EOS>
but
yours
,
said
I
(
all
glowing
like
the
fire
,
as
I
could
feel
:
)
<EOS>
But
,
sir
,
did
you
say
in
the
house
?
 
<EOS>
Ay
,
said
he
;
for
I
care
not
how
privately
it
be
done
;
and
it
must
be
very
public
if
we
go
to
church
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
holy
rite
,
sir
,
said
I
;
and
would
be
better
,
methinks
,
in
a
holy
place
.
  
<EOS>
I
see
(
said
he
,
most
kindly
)
<EOS>
my
lovely
maid
's
confusion
;
and
your
trembling
tenderness
shews
<EOS>
I
ought
to
oblige
you
all
I
may
.
 
<EOS>
Therefore
I
will
order
my
own
little
chapel
,
which
has
not
been
used
for
two
generations
,
for
any
thing
but
a
lumber
-
room
,
because
our
family
seldom
resided
here
long
together
,
to
be
cleared
and
cleaned
,
and
got
ready
for
the
ceremony
,
if
you
dislike
your
own
chamber
or
mine
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
,
said
I
,
that
will
be
better
than
the
chamber
,
and
I
hope
it
will
never
be
lumbered
again
,
but
kept
to
the
use
for
which
,
as
I
presume
,
it
has
been
consecrated
.
 
<EOS>
O
yes
,
said
he
,
it
has
been
consecrated
,
and
that
several
ages
ago
,
in
my
great
great
grandfather
's
time
,
who
built
that
and
the
good
old
house
together
.
  
<EOS>
But
now
,
my
good
girl
,
if
I
do
not
too
much
add
to
your
sweet
confusion
<EOS>
,
shall
it
be
in
the
first
seven
days
,
or
the
second
of
this
fortnight
?
 
<EOS>
I
looked
down
,
quite
out
of
countenance
.
 
<EOS>
Tell
me
,
said
he
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
second
,
if
you
please
,
sir
,
said
I.
 
As
you
please
,
said
he
most
kindly
;
<EOS>
but
I
should
thank
you
,
Pamela
,
if
you
would
choose
the
first
.
<EOS>
I
'd
rather
,
sir
,
if
you
please
,
said
I
,
have
the
second
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
said
he
,
be
it
so
;
but
do
n't
defer
it
till
the
last
day
of
the
fourteen
.
  
<EOS>
Pray
sir
,
said
I
,
since
you
embolden
me
to
talk
on
this
important
subject
,
may
I
not
send
my
dear
father
and
mother
word
of
my
happiness
?
  
<EOS>
You
may
,
said
he
;
but
charge
them
to
keep
it
secret
,
till
you
or
I
direct
the
contrary
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
told
you
,
I
would
see
no
more
of
your
papers
;
but
I
meant
,
I
would
not
without
your
consent
:
<EOS>
but
if
you
will
shew
them
to
me
(
and
now
I
have
no
other
motive
for
my
curiosity
,
but
the
pleasure
I
take
in
reading
what
you
write
,
)
<EOS>
I
shall
acknowledge
it
as
a
favour
.
  
<EOS>
If
,
sir
,
said
I
,
you
will
be
pleased
to
let
me
write
over
again
one
sheet
<EOS>
,
I
will
;
though
I
had
relied
upon
your
word
,
and
not
written
them
for
your
perusal
.
 
<EOS>
What
is
that
?
<EOS>
said
he
:
though
I
can
not
consent
to
it
beforehand
:
for
I
more
desire
to
see
them
,
because
they
are
your
true
sentiments
at
the
time
,
and
because
they
were
not
written
for
my
perusal
.
<EOS>
Sir
,
said
I
,
what
I
am
loath
you
should
see
,
are
very
severe
reflections
on
the
letter
I
received
by
the
gipsy
,
when
I
apprehended
your
design
of
the
sham
-
marriage
;
though
there
are
other
things
I
would
not
have
you
see
;
but
that
is
the
worst
.
 
<EOS>
It
ca
n't
be
worse
,
said
he
,
my
dear
sauce
-
box
,
than
I
have
seen
already
;
and
I
will
allow
your
treating
me
in
ever
so
black
a
manner
,
on
that
occasion
,
because
it
must
have
a
very
black
appearance
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
sir
,
said
I
<EOS>
,
I
think
I
will
obey
you
before
night
.
 
<EOS>
But
do
n't
alter
a
word
,
said
he
.
 
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
,
sir
,
replied
I
,
since
you
order
it
.
  
<EOS>
While
we
were
talking
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
came
up
,
and
said
Thomas
was
returned
.
<EOS>
O
,
said
my
master
,
let
him
bring
up
the
papers
:
for
he
hoped
,
and
so
did
I
,
that
you
had
sent
them
by
him
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
was
a
great
balk
,
when
he
came
up
and
said
,
Sir
,
Mr.
Andrews
did
not
care
to
deliver
them
;
and
would
have
it
,
that
his
daughter
was
forced
to
write
that
letter
to
him
:
and
,
indeed
,
sir
,
said
he
,
the
old
gentleman
took
on
sadly
,
and
would
have
it
that
his
daughter
was
undone
,
or
else
<EOS>
,
he
said
,
she
would
not
have
turned
back
,
when
on
her
way
,
(
as
I
told
him
she
did
,
said
Thomas
,
)
instead
of
coming
to
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
began
to
be
afraid
now
that
all
would
be
bad
for
me
again
.
  
<EOS>
Well
,
Tom
,
said
he
,
do
n't
mince
the
matter
;
tell
me
,
before
Mrs.
Andrews
,
what
they
said
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
sir
,
both
he
and
Goody
Andrews
,
after
they
had
conferred
together
upon
your
letter
,
madam
,
came
out
,
weeping
bitterly
,
that
grieved
my
very
heart
;
and
they
said
,
Now
all
was
over
with
their
poor
daughter
;
and
either
she
had
written
that
letter
by
compulsion
,
or
had
yielded
to
your
honour
;
so
they
said
;
and
was
,
or
would
be
ruined
!
  
<EOS>
My
master
seemed
vexed
,
as
I
feared
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
said
,
Pray
,
sir
,
be
so
good
as
to
excuse
the
fears
of
my
honest
parents
.
 
<EOS>
They
can
not
know
your
goodness
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
And
so
(
said
he
,
without
answering
me
,
)
<EOS>
they
refused
to
deliver
the
papers
?
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
and
please
your
honour
,
said
Thomas
,
though
I
told
them
,
that
you
,
madam
,
of
your
own
accord
,
on
a
letter
I
had
brought
you
,
very
cheerfully
wrote
what
I
carried
:
<EOS>
But
the
old
gentleman
said
,
Why
,
wife
,
there
are
in
these
papers
twenty
things
nobody
should
see
but
ourselves
,
and
especially
not
the
"
squire
.
 
<EOS>
O
the
poor
girl
has
had
so
many
stratagems
to
struggle
with
!
<EOS>
and
now
,
at
last
,
she
has
met
with
one
that
has
been
too
hard
for
her
.
 
<EOS>
And
can
it
be
possible
for
us
to
account
for
her
setting
out
to
come
to
us
,
and
in
such
post
haste
,
<EOS>
and
,
when
she
had
got
above
half
-
way
,
to
send
us
this
letter
,
and
to
go
back
again
of
her
own
accord
,
as
you
say
;
when
we
know
that
all
her
delight
would
have
been
to
come
to
us
and
to
escape
from
the
perils
she
had
been
so
long
contending
with
?
 
<EOS>
And
then
,
and
please
your
honour
,
he
said
,
he
could
not
bear
this
;
for
his
daughter
was
ruined
,
to
be
sure
,
before
now
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
,
said
Thomas
,
the
good
old
couple
sat
themselves
down
,
and
,
hand
-
in
-
hand
,
leaning
upon
each
other
's
shoulder
,
did
nothing
but
lament
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
piteously
grieved
,
said
he
;
but
all
I
could
say
could
not
comfort
them
;
nor
would
they
give
me
the
papers
;
though
I
told
them
I
should
deliver
them
only
to
Mrs.
Andrews
herself
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
,
and
please
your
honour
,
I
was
forced
to
come
away
without
them
.
  
<EOS>
My
good
master
saw
me
all
bathed
in
tears
at
this
description
of
your
distress
and
fears
for
me
;
and
he
said
,
I
would
not
have
you
take
on
so
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
angry
with
your
father
in
the
main
;
he
is
a
good
man
;
and
I
would
have
you
write
out
of
hand
,
and
it
shall
be
sent
by
the
post
to
Mr.
Atkins
,
who
lives
within
two
miles
of
your
father
,
and
I
'll
enclose
it
in
a
cover
of
mine
,
in
which
I
'll
desire
Mr.
Atkins
,
the
moment
it
comes
to
his
hand
,
to
convey
it
safely
to
your
father
or
mother
;
and
say
nothing
of
their
sending
their
papers
,
that
it
may
not
make
them
uneasy
;
for
I
want
not
now
to
see
them
on
any
other
score
than
that
of
mere
curiosity
;
and
that
will
do
at
any
time
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
saying
,
he
saluted
me
before
Thomas
,
and
with
his
own
handkerchief
wiped
my
eyes
;
and
said
to
Thomas
,
The
good
old
folks
are
not
to
be
blamed
in
the
main
.
 
<EOS>
They
do
n't
know
my
honourable
intentions
by
their
dear
daughter
;
who
,
Tom
,
will
,
in
a
little
time
,
be
your
mistress
;
though
I
shall
keep
the
matter
private
some
days
,
and
would
not
have
it
spoken
of
by
my
servants
out
of
my
house
.
  
<EOS>
Thomas
said
,
God
bless
your
honour
!
 
<EOS>
You
know
best
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
said
,
O
,
sir
,
you
are
all
goodness
!
 
<EOS>
How
kind
is
this
,
to
forgive
the
disappointment
,
instead
of
being
angry
,
as
I
feared
you
would
!
 
<EOS>
Thomas
then
withdrew
.
<EOS>
And
my
master
said
,
I
need
not
remind
you
of
writing
out
of
hand
,
to
make
the
good
folks
easy
:
and
I
will
leave
you
to
yourself
for
that
purpose
;
only
send
me
down
such
of
your
papers
,
as
you
are
willing
I
should
see
,
with
which
I
shall
entertain
myself
for
an
hour
or
two
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
one
thing
,
added
he
,
I
forgot
to
tell
you
:
The
neighbouring
gentry
I
mentioned
will
be
here
tomorrow
to
dine
with
me
,
and
I
have
ordered
Mrs.
Jewkes
to
prepare
for
them
.
 
<EOS>
And
must
I
,
sir
,
said
I
,
be
shewn
to
them
?
 
<EOS>
O
yes
,
said
he
;
that
's
the
chief
reason
of
their
coming
.
 
<EOS>
And
you
'll
see
nobody
equal
to
yourself
:
do
n't
be
concerned
.
  
<EOS>
I
opened
my
papers
,
as
soon
as
my
master
had
left
me
;
and
laid
out
those
beginning
on
the
Thursday
morning
he
set
out
for
Stamford
,
"
with
the
morning
visit
<EOS>
he
made
me
before
I
was
up
,
and
the
injunctions
of
watchfulness
,
etc
.
<EOS>
to
Mrs.
Jewkes
;
the
next
day
's
gipsy
affair
,
and
my
reflections
,
in
which
I
called
him
truly
diabolical
,
and
was
otherwise
very
severe
,
on
the
strong
appearances
the
matter
had
then
against
him
.
<EOS>
His
return
on
Saturday
,
with
the
dread
he
put
me
in
,
on
the
offering
to
search
me
for
my
papers
which
followed
those
he
had
got
by
Mrs.
Jewkes
's
means
.
 
<EOS>
My
being
forced
to
give
them
up
.
 
<EOS>
His
carriage
to
me
after
he
had
read
them
,
and
questions
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
His
great
kindness
to
me
on
seeing
the
dangers
I
had
escaped
and
the
troubles
I
had
undergone
.
 
<EOS>
And
how
I
unseasonably
,
in
the
midst
of
his
goodness
,
expressed
my
desire
of
being
sent
to
you
,
having
the
intelligence
of
a
sham
-
marriage
,
from
the
gipsy
,
in
my
thoughts
.
 
<EOS>
How
this
enraged
him
,
and
made
him
turn
me
that
very
Sunday
out
of
his
house
,
and
send
me
on
my
way
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
The
particulars
of
my
journey
,
and
my
grief
at
parting
with
him
;
and
my
free
acknowledgment
to
you
,
that
I
found
,
unknown
to
myself
<EOS>
,
I
had
begun
to
love
him
,
and
could
not
help
it
.
 
<EOS>
His
sending
after
me
,
to
beg
my
return
;
but
yet
generously
leaving
me
at
my
liberty
,
when
he
might
have
forced
me
to
return
whether
I
was
willing
or
not
.
 
<EOS>
My
resolution
to
oblige
him
,
and
fatiguing
journey
back
.
 
<EOS>
My
concern
for
his
illness
on
my
return
.
 
<EOS>
His
kind
reception
of
me
,
and
shewing
me
his
sister
Davers
's
angry
letter
,
against
his
behaviour
to
me
,
desiring
him
to
set
me
free
,
and
threatening
to
renounce
him
as
a
brother
,
if
he
should
degrade
himself
by
marrying
me
.
 
<EOS>
My
serious
reflections
on
this
letter
,
etc
.
"
<EOS>
(
all
which
,
I
hope
,
with
the
others
,
you
will
shortly
see
.
)
 
<EOS>
And
this
carried
matters
down
to
Tuesday
night
last
.
  
<EOS>
All
that
followed
was
so
kind
on
his
side
,
being
our
chariot
conference
,
as
above
,
on
Wednesday
morning
,
and
how
good
he
has
been
ever
since
,
that
I
thought
I
would
go
no
further
;
for
I
was
a
little
ashamed
to
be
so
very
open
on
that
tender
and
most
grateful
subject
;
though
his
great
goodness
to
me
deserves
all
the
acknowledgments
I
can
possibly
make
.
  
<EOS>
And
when
I
had
looked
these
out
,
I
carried
them
down
myself
into
the
parlour
to
him
;
and
said
,
putting
them
into
his
hands
,
Your
allowances
,
good
sir
,
as
heretofore
;
and
if
I
have
been
too
open
and
free
in
my
reflections
or
declarations
,
let
my
fears
on
one
side
,
and
my
sincerity
on
the
other
,
be
my
excuse
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
very
obliging
,
my
good
girl
,
said
he
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
nothing
to
apprehend
from
my
thoughts
,
any
more
than
from
my
actions
.
  
<EOS>
So
I
went
up
,
and
wrote
the
letter
to
you
,
briefly
acquainting
you
with
my
present
happiness
,
and
my
master
's
goodness
,
and
expressing
the
gratitude
of
heart
,
which
I
owe
to
the
kindest
gentleman
in
the
world
,
and
assuring
you
,
that
I
should
soon
have
the
pleasure
of
sending
back
to
you
,
not
only
those
papers
,
but
all
that
succeeded
them
to
this
time
,
as
I
know
you
delight
to
amuse
yourself
in
your
leisure
hours
with
my
scribble
:
<EOS>
And
I
said
,
carrying
it
down
to
my
master
,
before
I
sealed
it
,
Will
you
please
,
sir
,
to
take
the
trouble
of
reading
what
I
write
to
my
dear
parents
?
 
<EOS>
Thank
you
,
Pamela
,
said
he
,
and
set
me
on
his
knee
,
while
he
read
it
;
and
seemed
much
pleased
with
it
;
and
giving
it
me
again
,
You
are
very
happy
,
said
he
,
my
beloved
girl
,
in
your
style
and
expressions
:
and
the
affectionate
things
you
say
of
me
are
inexpressibly
obliging
;
and
again
,
with
this
kiss
,
said
he
,
do
I
confirm
for
truth
all
that
you
have
promised
for
my
intentions
in
this
letter
.
 
<EOS>
O
what
halcyon
days
are
these
!
 
<EOS>
God
continue
them
!
 
<EOS>
A
change
would
kill
me
quite
.
  
<EOS>
He
went
out
in
his
chariot
in
the
afternoon
;
and
in
the
evening
returned
,
and
sent
me
word
<EOS>
,
he
would
be
glad
of
my
company
for
a
little
walk
in
the
garden
;
and
down
I
went
that
very
moment
.
  
<EOS>
He
came
to
meet
me
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
says
he
,
how
does
my
dear
girl
do
now
?
 
<EOS>
Whom
do
you
think
I
have
seen
since
I
have
been
out
?
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
,
sir
,
said
I.
Why
,
said
he
,
there
is
a
turning
in
the
road
,
about
five
miles
off
,
<EOS>
that
goes
round
a
meadow
,
that
has
a
pleasant
foot
-
way
,
by
the
side
of
a
little
brook
,
and
a
double
row
of
limes
on
each
side
,
where
now
and
then
the
gentry
in
the
neighbourhood
walk
,
and
angle
,
and
divert
themselves
.
  
<EOS>
I
'll
shew
it
you
next
opportunity
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
stept
out
of
my
chariot
,
to
walk
across
this
meadow
,
and
bid
Robin
meet
me
with
it
on
the
further
part
of
it
:
<EOS>
And
whom
should
I
"
spy
there
,
walking
,
with
a
book
in
his
hand
,
reading
,
but
your
humble
servant
Mr.
Williams
!
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
blush
,
Pamela
,
said
he
.
 
<EOS>
As
his
back
was
towards
me
,
I
thought
I
would
speak
to
the
man
:
<EOS>
and
,
before
he
saw
me
,
I
said
,
How
do
you
,
old
acquaintance
?
<EOS>
(
for
,
said
he
,
<EOS>
you
know
we
were
of
one
college
for
a
twelvemonth
.
)
 
<EOS>
I
thought
the
man
would
have
jumped
into
the
brook
,
he
gave
such
a
start
at
hearing
my
voice
,
and
seeing
me
.
  
<EOS>
Poor
man
!
<EOS>
said
I.
 
Ay
,
said
he
,
<EOS>
but
not
too
much
of
your
poor
man
,
in
that
soft
accent
,
neither
,
Pamela
.
 
<EOS>
Said
I
<EOS>
,
I
am
sorry
my
voice
is
so
startling
to
you
,
Mr.
Williams
.
 
<EOS>
What
are
you
reading
?
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
said
he
,
and
stammered
with
the
surprise
,
it
is
the
French
Telemachus
;
for
I
am
about
perfecting
myself
,
if
I
can
,
in
the
French
tongue
.
 
<EOS>
Thought
<EOS>
I
,
I
had
rather
so
,
than
perfecting
my
Pamela
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
You
do
well
,
replied
I.
  
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
think
that
yonder
cloud
may
give
us
a
small
shower
?
<EOS>
and
it
did
a
little
begin
to
wet
.
 
<EOS>
He
said
,
he
believed
not
much
.
  
<EOS>
If
,
said
I
,
you
are
for
the
village
,
I
'll
give
you
a
cast
;
for
I
shall
call
at
Sir
Simon
's
in
my
return
from
the
little
round
I
am
taking
.
 
<EOS>
He
asked
me
if
it
was
not
too
great
a
favour
?
 
<EOS>
No
,
said
I
,
do
n't
talk
of
that
;
let
us
walk
to
the
further
opening
there
,
and
we
shall
meet
my
chariot
.
  
<EOS>
So
,
Pamela
,
continued
my
master
,
we
fell
into
conversation
as
we
walked
.
<EOS>
He
said
he
was
very
sorry
he
had
incurred
my
displeasure
;
and
the
more
,
as
he
had
been
told
,
by
Lady
Jones
,
who
had
it
from
Sir
Simon
's
family
,
that
I
had
a
more
honourable
view
than
at
first
was
apprehended
.
 
<EOS>
I
said
,
We
fellows
of
fortune
,
Mr.
Williams
,
take
sometimes
a
little
more
liberty
with
the
world
than
we
ought
to
do
;
<EOS>
wantoning
,
very
probably
,
as
you
contemplative
folks
would
say
,
in
the
sunbeams
of
a
dangerous
affluence
;
and
can
not
think
of
confining
ourselves
to
the
common
paths
,
though
the
safest
and
most
eligible
,
after
all
.
 
<EOS>
And
you
may
believe
I
could
not
very
well
like
to
be
supplanted
in
a
view
that
lay
next
my
heart
;
and
that
by
an
old
acquaintance
,
whose
good
,
before
this
affair
,
I
was
studious
to
promote
.
  
<EOS>
I
would
only
say
,
sir
,
said
he
,
that
my
first
motive
was
entirely
such
as
became
my
function
:
<EOS>
And
,
very
politely
,
said
my
master
,
he
added
,
And
I
am
very
sure
,
that
however
inexcusable
I
might
seem
in
the
progress
of
the
matter
,
yourself
,
sir
,
would
have
been
sorry
to
have
it
said
,
you
had
cast
your
thoughts
on
a
person
,
that
nobody
could
have
wished
for
but
yourself
.
  
<EOS>
Well
,
Mr.
Williams
,
said
I
,
I
see
you
are
a
man
of
gallantry
,
as
well
as
religion
<EOS>
:
But
what
I
took
most
amiss
was
,
that
,
if
you
thought
me
doing
a
wrong
thing
,
you
did
not
expostulate
with
me
upon
it
,
as
your
function
might
have
allowed
you
to
do
;
but
immediately
determined
to
counterplot
me
,
and
attempt
to
secure
to
yourself
a
prize
you
would
have
robbed
me
of
,
and
that
from
my
own
house
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
matter
is
at
an
end
,
and
I
retain
not
any
malice
upon
it
;
though
you
did
not
know
<EOS>
but
I
might
,
at
last
,
do
honourably
by
her
,
as
I
actually
intend
.
  
<EOS>
I
am
sorry
for
myself
,
sir
,
said
he
,
that
I
should
so
unhappily
incur
your
displeasure
;
but
I
rejoice
for
her
sake
in
your
honourable
intentions
:
give
me
leave
only
to
say
,
that
if
you
make
Miss
Andrews
your
lady
,
she
will
do
credit
to
your
choice
with
every
body
that
sees
her
,
or
comes
to
know
her
;
and
,
for
person
and
mind
both
,
you
may
challenge
the
county
.
  
<EOS>
In
this
manner
,
said
my
master
,
did
the
parson
and
I
confabulate
;
and
I
set
him
down
at
his
lodgings
in
the
village
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
kept
your
secret
,
Pamela
;
and
would
not
own
,
that
you
gave
any
encouragement
to
his
addresses
.
  
<EOS>
Indeed
,
sir
,
said
I
,
he
could
not
say
that
I
did
;
and
I
hope
you
believe
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
,
I
do
,
said
he
:
<EOS>
but
'
tis
still
my
opinion
,
that
if
,
when
I
saw
plots
set
up
against
my
plots
,
I
had
not
discovered
the
parson
as
I
did
,
the
correspondence
between
you
might
have
gone
to
a
length
that
would
have
put
our
present
situation
out
of
both
our
powers
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
,
said
I
,
when
you
consider
,
that
my
utmost
presumption
could
not
make
me
hope
for
the
honour
you
now
seem
to
design
me
;
that
I
was
so
hardly
used
,
and
had
no
prospect
before
me
but
dishonour
,
you
will
allow
that
I
should
have
seemed
very
little
in
earnest
in
my
professions
of
honesty
,
if
I
had
not
endeavoured
to
get
away
:
<EOS>
but
yet
I
resolved
not
to
think
of
marriage
;
for
I
never
saw
the
man
I
could
love
,
till
your
goodness
emboldened
me
to
look
up
to
you
.
  
<EOS>
I
should
,
my
dear
Pamela
,
said
he
,
make
a
very
ill
compliment
to
my
vanity
,
if
I
did
not
believe
you
;
though
,
at
the
same
time
,
justice
calls
upon
me
to
say
,
that
it
is
,
some
things
considered
,
beyond
my
merit
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
sweet
,
noble
expression
for
your
poor
daughter
,
my
dear
father
and
mother
!
 
<EOS>
And
from
my
master
too
!
  
<EOS>
I
was
glad
to
hear
this
account
of
the
interview
between
Mr.
Williams
and
himself
;
but
I
dared
not
to
say
so
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
in
time
he
will
be
reinstated
in
his
good
graces
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
so
good
as
to
tell
me
,
he
had
given
orders
for
the
chapel
to
be
cleared
.
 
<EOS>
O
how
I
look
forward
with
inward
joy
,
yet
with
fear
and
trembling
!
  
<EOS>
Friday
.
  
<EOS>
About
twelve
o'clock
came
Sir
Simon
,
and
his
lady
and
two
daughters
;
and
Lady
Jones
,
and
a
sister
-
in
-
law
of
hers
;
and
Mr.
Peters
,
and
his
spouse
and
niece
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
who
is
more
and
more
obliging
,
was
much
concerned
<EOS>
I
was
not
dressed
in
some
of
my
best
clothes
,
and
made
me
many
compliments
.
  
<EOS>
They
all
went
into
the
garden
for
a
walk
,
before
dinner
;
and
,
I
understood
,
were
so
impatient
to
see
me
,
that
my
master
took
them
into
the
largest
alcove
,
after
they
had
walked
two
or
three
turns
,
and
stept
himself
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
Come
,
my
Pamela
,
said
he
,
the
ladies
ca
n't
be
satisfied
without
seeing
you
,
and
I
desire
you
'll
come
.
 
<EOS>
I
said
,
I
was
ashamed
;
but
I
would
obey
him
.
 
<EOS>
Said
he
,
The
two
young
ladies
are
dressed
out
in
their
best
attire
;
but
they
make
not
such
an
appearance
as
my
charming
girl
in
this
ordinary
garb
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
said
I
,
sha
n't
I
follow
you
thither
?
 
<EOS>
For
I
ca
n't
bear
you
<EOS>
should
do
me
so
much
honour
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
said
he
,
I
'll
go
before
you
.
 
<EOS>
And
he
bid
Mrs.
Jewkes
bring
a
bottle
of
sack
,
and
some
cake
.
 
<EOS>
So
he
went
down
to
them
.
  
<EOS>
This
alcove
fronts
the
longest
gravel
-
walk
in
the
garden
,
so
that
they
saw
me
all
the
way
I
came
,
for
a
good
way
:
and
my
master
told
me
afterwards
,
with
pleasure
,
all
they
said
of
me
.
  
<EOS>
Will
you
forgive
the
little
vain
slut
,
your
daughter
,
if
I
tell
you
all
,
as
he
was
pleased
to
tell
me
?
 
<EOS>
He
said
,
"
spying
me
first
,
Look
,
there
,
ladies
,
comes
my
pretty
rustic
!
 
<EOS>
They
all
,
I
saw
,
which
dashed
me
,
stood
at
the
windows
,
and
in
the
door
-
way
,
looking
full
at
me
.
  
<EOS>
My
master
told
me
,
that
Lady
Jones
said
,
She
is
a
charming
creature
,
I
see
that
,
at
this
distance
.
 
<EOS>
And
Sir
Simon
,
it
seems
,
who
has
been
a
sad
rake
in
his
younger
days
,
swore
he
never
saw
so
easy
an
air
,
so
fine
a
shape
,
and
so
graceful
a
presence
.
 
<EOS>
The
Lady
Darnford
said
,
I
was
a
sweet
girl
.
 
<EOS>
And
Mrs.
Peters
said
very
handsome
things
.
 
<EOS>
Even
the
parson
said
,
I
should
be
the
pride
of
the
county
.
 
<EOS>
O
,
dear
sirs
!
<EOS>
all
this
was
owing
to
the
light
my
good
master
's
favour
placed
me
in
,
which
made
me
shine
out
in
their
eyes
beyond
my
deserts
.
 
<EOS>
He
said
the
young
ladies
blushed
,
and
envied
me
.
  
<EOS>
When
I
came
near
,
he
saw
me
in
a
little
confusion
,
and
was
so
kind
as
to
meet
me
:
<EOS>
Give
me
your
hand
,
said
he
,
my
poor
girl
;
you
walk
too
fast
,
(
for
,
indeed
<EOS>
,
I
wanted
to
be
out
of
their
gazing
)
.
 
<EOS>
I
did
so
,
with
a
courtesy
,
and
he
led
me
up
the
steps
of
the
alcove
,
and
,
in
a
most
gentleman
-
like
manner
,
presented
me
to
the
ladies
,
and
they
all
saluted
me
,
and
said
,
They
hoped
to
be
better
acquainted
with
me
:
and
Lady
Darnford
was
pleased
to
say
,
I
should
be
the
flower
of
their
neighbourhood
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
Simon
said
,
<EOS>
Good
neighbour
,
by
your
leave
;
and
saluting
me
,
added
,
Now
will
I
say
,
that
I
have
kissed
the
loveliest
maiden
in
England
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
for
all
this
,
methought
<EOS>
I
owed
him
a
grudge
for
a
tell
-
tale
,
though
all
had
turned
out
so
happily
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Peters
very
gravely
followed
his
example
,
and
said
,
like
a
bishop
,
God
bless
you
,
fair
excellence
!
<EOS>
said
Lady
Jones
,
Pray
,
dear
madam
,
sit
down
by
me
:
and
they
all
sat
down
:
<EOS>
But
I
said
,
I
would
stand
,
if
they
pleased
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
Pamela
,
said
my
master
:
<EOS>
pray
sit
down
with
these
good
ladies
,
my
neighbours
:
 
<EOS>
They
will
indulge
it
to
you
,
for
my
sake
,
till
they
know
you
better
;
and
for
your
own
,
when
they
are
acquainted
with
you
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
said
I
,
I
shall
be
proud
to
deserve
their
indulgence
.
  
<EOS>
They
all
so
gazed
at
me
,
that
I
could
not
look
up
;
for
I
think
it
is
one
of
the
distinctions
of
persons
of
condition
,
and
well
-
bred
people
,
to
put
bashful
bodies
out
of
countenance
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
Sir
Simon
,
said
my
master
,
what
say
you
now
to
my
pretty
rustic
?
 
<EOS>
He
swore
a
great
oath
,
that
he
should
better
know
what
to
say
to
me
if
he
was
as
young
as
himself
.
 
<EOS>
Lady
Darnford
said
,
You
will
never
leave
,
Sir
Simon
.
  
<EOS>
Said
my
master
,
You
are
a
little
confused
,
my
good
girl
,
and
out
of
breath
;
but
I
have
told
all
my
kind
neighbours
here
a
good
deal
of
your
story
,
and
your
excellence
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
said
Lady
Darnford
,
my
dear
neighbour
,
as
I
will
call
you
;
we
that
are
here
present
have
all
heard
of
your
uncommon
story
.
 
<EOS>
Madam
,
said
I
,
you
have
then
heard
what
must
make
your
kind
allowance
for
me
very
necessary
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
said
Mrs.
Peters
,
we
have
heard
what
will
always
make
you
valued
as
an
honour
to
our
sex
,
and
as
a
worthy
pattern
for
all
the
young
ladies
in
the
county
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
very
good
,
madam
,
said
I
,
to
make
me
able
to
look
up
,
and
to
be
thankful
for
the
honour
you
are
pleased
to
do
me
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
came
in
with
the
canary
,
brought
by
Nan
,
to
the
alcove
,
and
some
cakes
on
a
silver
salver
;
and
I
said
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
let
me
be
your
assistant
;
I
will
serve
the
ladies
with
the
cake
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
I
took
the
salver
,
and
went
round
to
the
good
company
with
it
,
ending
with
my
master
.
 
<EOS>
The
Lady
Jones
said
,
She
never
was
served
with
such
a
grace
,
and
it
was
giving
me
too
much
trouble
.
 
<EOS>
O
,
madam
<EOS>
,
said
I
,
I
hope
my
good
master
's
favour
will
never
make
me
forget
,
that
it
is
my
duty
to
wait
upon
his
friends
.
 
<EOS>
Master
,
sweet
one
!
<EOS>
said
Sir
Simon
,
<EOS>
I
hope
you
wo
n't
always
call
Mr.
B
#
#
#
#
by
that
name
,
for
fear
it
should
become
a
fashion
for
all
our
ladies
to
do
the
like
through
the
county
.
 
<EOS>
I
,
sir
,
said
I
,
shall
have
many
reasons
to
continue
this
style
,
which
can
not
affect
your
good
ladies
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Simon
,
said
Lady
Jones
,
you
are
very
arch
upon
us
<EOS>
but
I
see
very
well
,
that
it
will
be
the
interest
of
all
the
gentlemen
,
to
bring
their
ladies
into
an
intimacy
with
one
that
can
give
them
such
a
good
example
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
then
,
madam
,
said
I
,
it
must
be
after
I
have
been
polished
and
improved
by
the
honour
of
such
an
example
as
yours
.
  
<EOS>
They
all
were
very
good
and
affable
;
and
the
young
Lady
Darnford
,
who
had
wished
to
see
me
in
this
dress
,
said
,
I
beg
your
pardon
,
dear
miss
,
as
she
called
me
;
but
I
had
heard
how
sweetly
this
garb
became
you
,
and
was
told
the
history
of
it
;
and
I
begged
it
,
as
a
favour
,
that
you
might
oblige
us
with
your
appearance
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
much
obliged
to
your
ladyship
,
said
I
,
that
your
kind
prescription
was
so
agreeable
to
my
choice
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
said
she
,
was
it
your
choice
then
?
 
<EOS>
I
am
glad
of
that
:
though
I
am
sure
your
person
must
give
,
and
not
take
,
ornament
from
any
dress
.
  
<EOS>
You
are
very
kind
,
madam
,
said
I
:
but
there
will
be
the
less
reason
to
fear
I
should
forget
the
high
obligations
I
should
have
to
the
kindest
of
gentlemen
,
when
I
can
delight
to
shew
the
humble
degree
from
which
his
goodness
had
raised
me
.
 
<EOS>
My
dear
Pamela
,
said
my
master
,
if
you
proceed
at
this
rate
,
I
must
insist
upon
your
first
seven
days
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
what
I
mean
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
said
I
,
you
are
all
goodness
!
  
<EOS>
They
drank
a
glass
of
sack
each
,
and
Sir
Simon
would
make
me
do
so
too
,
saying
,
It
will
be
a
reflection
,
madam
,
upon
all
the
ladies
,
if
you
do
n't
do
as
they
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
Sir
Simon
,
said
I
,
that
ca
n't
be
,
because
the
ladies
'
journey
hither
makes
a
glass
of
canary
a
proper
cordial
for
them
:
<EOS>
but
I
wo
n't
refuse
;
because
I
will
do
myself
the
honour
of
drinking
good
health
to
you
,
and
to
all
this
worthy
company
.
  
<EOS>
Said
good
Lady
Darnford
,
to
my
master
<EOS>
,
I
hope
,
sir
,
we
shall
have
Mrs.
Andrews
's
company
at
table
.
 
<EOS>
He
said
,
very
obligingly
,
<EOS>
Madam
,
it
is
her
time
now
;
and
I
will
leave
it
to
her
choice
.
 
<EOS>
If
the
good
ladies
,
then
,
will
forgive
me
,
sir
,
said
I
,
I
had
rather
be
excused
.
 
<EOS>
They
all
said
,
I
must
not
be
excused
.
 
<EOS>
I
begged
I
might
.
 
<EOS>
Your
reason
for
it
,
my
dear
Pamela
?
<EOS>
said
my
master
:
since
the
ladies
request
it
,
I
wish
you
would
oblige
them
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
replied
I
,
your
goodness
will
make
me
,
every
day
,
worthier
of
the
honour
the
ladies
do
me
;
and
when
I
can
persuade
myself
that
I
am
more
worthy
of
it
than
at
present
<EOS>
,
I
shall
with
great
joy
embrace
all
the
opportunities
they
will
be
pleased
to
give
me
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Peters
whispered
Lady
Jones
,
as
my
master
told
me
afterwards
;
Did
you
ever
see
such
excellence
,
such
prudence
,
and
discretion
?
 
<EOS>
Never
in
my
life
,
said
the
other
good
lady
.
 
<EOS>
She
will
adorn
,
she
was
pleased
to
say
,
her
distinction
.
 
<EOS>
Ay
,
says
Mrs.
Peters
,
she
would
adorn
any
station
in
life
.
  
<EOS>
My
good
master
was
highly
delighted
,
generous
gentleman
as
he
is
!
<EOS>
with
the
favourable
opinion
of
the
ladies
;
and
I
took
the
more
pleasure
in
it
,
because
their
favour
seemed
to
lessen
the
disgrace
of
his
stooping
so
much
beneath
himself
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Darnford
said
,
We
will
not
oppress
you
;
though
we
could
almost
blame
your
too
punctilious
exactness
:
but
if
we
excuse
Miss
Andrews
from
dinner
,
we
must
insist
upon
her
company
at
the
card
-
table
,
and
at
a
dish
of
tea
;
for
we
intend
to
pass
the
whole
day
with
you
,
sir
,
as
we
told
you
.
 
<EOS>
What
say
you
to
that
,
Pamela
,
said
my
master
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
replied
I
,
whatever
you
and
the
ladies
please
,
I
will
cheerfully
do
.
 
<EOS>
They
said
,
I
was
very
obliging
.
 
<EOS>
But
Sir
Simon
rapt
out
an
oath
,
and
said
,
That
they
might
dine
together
,
if
they
would
;
but
he
would
dine
with
me
,
and
nobody
else
:
for
,
said
he
,
I
say
,
sir
,
as
Parson
Williams
said
,
(
by
which
I
found
my
master
had
told
them
the
story
,
)
<EOS>
You
must
not
think
you
have
chosen
one
that
nobody
can
like
but
yourself
.
  
<EOS>
The
young
ladies
said
,
If
I
pleased
they
would
take
a
turn
about
the
garden
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
answered
,
I
would
very
gladly
attend
them
;
and
<EOS>
so
we
three
,
and
Lady
Jones
's
sister
-
in
-
law
,
and
Mr.
Peters
's
niece
,
walked
together
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
very
affable
,
kind
,
and
obliging
;
and
we
soon
entered
into
a
good
deal
of
familiarity
;
and
I
found
Miss
Darnford
a
very
agreeable
person
.
 
<EOS>
Her
sister
was
a
little
more
on
the
reserve
;
and
I
afterwards
heard
,
that
,
about
a
year
before
,
she
would
fain
have
had
my
master
make
his
addresses
to
her
:
but
though
Sir
Simon
is
reckoned
rich
,
she
was
not
thought
sufficient
fortune
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
And
now
,
to
have
him
look
down
so
low
as
me
,
must
be
a
sort
of
mortification
to
a
poor
young
lady
!
 
<EOS>
And
I
pitied
her
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
I
did
!
 
<EOS>
I
wish
all
young
persons
of
my
sex
could
be
as
happy
as
I
am
like
to
be
.
  
<EOS>
My
master
told
me
afterwards
,
that
I
left
the
other
ladies
,
and
Sir
Simon
and
Mr.
Peters
,
full
of
my
praises
:
so
that
they
could
hardly
talk
of
any
thing
else
;
one
lanching
out
upon
my
complexion
,
another
upon
my
eyes
,
my
hand
,
and
,
in
short
,
for
you
'll
think
me
sadly
proud
,
upon
my
whole
person
and
behaviour
;
and
they
all
magnified
my
readiness
and
obligingness
in
my
answers
,
and
the
like
:
<EOS>
And
I
was
glad
of
it
,
as
I
said
,
for
my
good
master
's
sake
,
who
seemed
quite
pleased
and
rejoiced
.
<EOS>
God
bless
him
for
his
goodness
to
me
!
  
<EOS>
Dinner
not
being
ready
,
the
young
ladies
proposed
a
tune
upon
the
spinnet
.
 
<EOS>
I
said
,
I
believed
it
was
not
in
tune
.
 
<EOS>
They
said
,
they
knew
it
was
but
a
few
months
ago
.
 
<EOS>
If
it
is
,
said
I
,
I
wish
I
had
known
it
;
though
indeed
,
ladies
,
added
I
,
since
you
know
my
story
,
I
must
own
,
that
my
mind
has
not
been
long
in
tune
,
to
make
use
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
So
they
would
make
me
play
upon
it
,
and
sing
to
it
;
which
I
did
,
a
song
my
dear
good
lady
made
me
learn
,
and
used
to
be
pleased
with
,
and
which
she
brought
with
her
from
Bath
:
and
the
ladies
were
much
taken
with
the
song
,
and
were
so
kind
as
to
approve
my
performance
:
<EOS>
And
Miss
Darnford
was
pleased
to
compliment
me
,
that
I
had
all
the
accomplishments
of
my
sex
.
 
<EOS>
I
said
,
I
had
had
a
good
lady
,
in
my
master
's
mother
,
who
had
spared
no
pains
nor
cost
to
improve
me
.
 
<EOS>
She
said
,
she
wished
Mr.
B
#
#
#
#
could
be
prevailed
upon
to
give
a
ball
on
an
approaching
happy
occasion
,
that
we
might
have
a
dancing
-
match
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
ca
n't
say
I
do
;
though
I
did
not
say
so
:
for
these
occasions
,
I
think
,
are
too
solemn
for
the
principals
,
at
least
of
our
sex
,
to
take
part
in
,
especially
if
they
have
the
same
thoughts
of
that
solemnity
that
I
have
:
For
,
indeed
,
though
I
have
before
me
a
prospect
of
happiness
,
that
may
be
envied
by
ladies
of
high
rank
,
yet
I
must
own
to
you
,
my
dear
parents
,
that
I
have
something
very
awful
upon
my
mind
,
when
I
think
of
the
matter
;
and
shall
,
more
and
more
,
as
it
draws
nearer
and
nearer
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
the
song
:
                    
<EOS>
I.
      
Go
,
happy
paper
,
gently
steal
,
      
And
underneath
her
pillow
lie
;
    
There
,
in
soft
dreams
,
my
love
reveal
,
    
That
love
which
I
must
still
conceal
,
      
And
,
wrapt
in
awful
silence
,
die
.
                   
<EOS>
II

<EOS>
Should
flames
be
doom'd
<EOS>
thy
hapless
fate
,
      
<EOS>
To
atoms
thou
wouldst
quickly
turn
:
    
<EOS>
My
pains
may
bear
a
longer
date
;
    
For
should
I
live
,
and
should
she
hate
,
      
<EOS>
In
endless
torments
I
should
burn
.

<EOS>
Tell
fair
AURELIA
<EOS>

she
has
charms

Might
in
a
hermit
stir
desire

<EOS>
T
'
attain
the
heav'n
<EOS>
that
's
in
her
arms
,
    
<EOS>
I
'd
quit
the
world
's
alluring
harms

<EOS>
And
to
a
cell
content
,
retire

<EOS>
Of
all
that
pleas'd
<EOS>
my
ravish'd
eye
,
      
Her
beauty
should
supply
the
place
;
    
Bold
Raphael
's
strokes
,
and
Titian
's
dye
,
    
Should
but
in
vain
presume
to
vie
      
With
her
inimitable
face
.
                    
<EOS>
V.
      
<EOS>
No
more
I
'd
wish
for
Phoebus
'
rays
,
      
<EOS>
To
gild
the
object
of
my
sight
;
    
<EOS>
Much
less
the
taper
's
fainter
blaze
:
    
<EOS>
Her
eyes
should
measure
out
my
days
;
        
And
when
she
slept
,
it
should
be
night
.
  
<EOS>
About
four
o'clock
.
  
<EOS>
My
master
just
came
up
to
me
,
and
said
,
If
you
should
see
Mr.
Williams
below
,
do
you
think
,
Pamela
,
you
should
not
be
surprised
?
 
<EOS>
No
,
sir
,
said
I
,
I
hope
not
.
 
<EOS>
Why
should
I
?
 
<EOS>
Expect
,
said
he
,
a
stranger
<EOS>
then
,
when
you
come
down
to
us
in
the
parlour
;
for
the
ladies
are
preparing
themselves
for
the
card
-
table
,
and
they
insist
upon
your
company
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
a
mind
,
sir
,
said
I
,
I
believe
,
to
try
all
my
courage
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
said
he
,
does
it
want
courage
to
see
him
?
 
<EOS>
No
,
sir
,
said
I
,
not
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
was
grievously
dashed
to
see
all
those
strange
ladies
and
gentlemen
;
and
now
to
see
Mr.
Williams
before
them
,
as
some
of
them
refused
his
application
for
me
,
when
I
wanted
to
get
away
,
it
will
a
little
shock
me
,
to
see
them
smile
,
in
recollecting
what
has
passed
of
that
kind
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
said
he
,
guard
your
heart
against
surprises
,
though
you
shall
see
,
when
you
come
down
,
a
man
that
I
can
allow
you
to
love
dearly
;
though
hardly
preferably
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
This
surprises
me
much
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
afraid
he
begins
to
be
jealous
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
What
will
become
of
me
,
(
for
he
looked
very
seriously
,
)
if
any
turn
should
happen
now
!
 
<EOS>
My
heart
aches
!
 
<EOS>
I
know
not
what
's
the
matter
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
will
go
down
as
brisk
as
I
can
,
that
nothing
may
be
imputed
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
I
wish
this
Mr.
Williams
had
not
been
there
now
,
when
they
are
all
there
;
because
of
their
fleers
at
him
and
me
.
 
<EOS>
Otherwise
I
should
be
glad
to
see
the
poor
gentleman
;
for
,
indeed
,
I
think
him
a
good
man
,
and
he
has
suffered
for
my
sake
.
  
<EOS>
So
,
I
am
sent
for
down
to
cards
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
go
;
but
wish
I
may
continue
their
good
opinions
of
me
<EOS>
:
for
I
shall
be
very
awkward
.
 
<EOS>
My
master
,
by
his
serious
question
,
and
bidding
me
guard
my
heart
against
surprises
,
<EOS>
though
I
should
see
,
when
I
came
down
,
a
man
he
can
allow
me
to
love
dearly
,
though
hardly
better
than
himself
,
has
quite
alarmed
me
,
and
made
me
sad
!
 
<EOS>
I
hope
he
loves
me
!
 
<EOS>
But
whether
he
does
or
not
,
I
am
in
for
it
now
,
over
head
and
ears
,
I
doubt
,
and
ca
n't
help
loving
him
;
'
tis
a
folly
to
deny
it
.
 
<EOS>
But
to
be
sure
I
ca
n't
love
any
man
preferably
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
soon
know
what
he
means
.
  
<EOS>
Now
,
my
dear
mother
,
must
I
write
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
Well
might
my
good
master
say
so
mysteriously
as
he
did
,
about
guarding
my
heart
against
surprises
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
was
so
surprised
in
my
life
;
and
never
could
see
a
man
I
loved
so
dearly
!
 
<EOS>
O
<EOS>
my
dear
mother
,
it
was
my
dear
,
dear
father
,
and
not
Mr.
Williams
,
that
was
below
ready
to
receive
and
to
bless
your
daughter
!
<EOS>
and
both
my
master
and
he
enjoined
me
to
write
how
the
whole
matter
was
,
and
what
my
thoughts
were
on
this
joyful
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
I
will
take
the
matter
from
the
beginning
,
that
Providence
directed
his
feet
to
this
house
,
to
this
time
,
as
I
have
had
it
from
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
from
my
master
,
my
father
,
the
ladies
,
and
my
own
heart
and
conduct
,
as
far
as
I
know
of
both
;
because
they
command
it
,
and
you
will
be
pleased
with
my
relation
and
so
,
as
you
know
how
I
came
by
the
connexion
,
will
make
one
uniform
relation
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
It
seems
,
then
,
my
dear
father
and
you
were
so
uneasy
to
know
the
truth
of
the
story
which
Thomas
had
told
you
,
that
fearing
I
was
betrayed
,
and
quite
undone
,
he
got
leave
of
absence
,
and
set
out
the
day
after
Thomas
was
there
;
and
so
,
on
Friday
morning
,
he
got
to
the
neighbouring
town
;
and
there
he
heard
,
that
the
gentry
in
the
neighbourhood
were
at
my
master
's
,
at
a
great
entertainment
.
 
<EOS>
He
put
on
a
clean
shirt
and
neckcloth
(
which
he
brought
in
his
pocket
)
at
an
alehouse
there
,
and
got
shaved
;
and
<EOS>
so
,
after
he
had
eaten
some
bread
and
cheese
,
and
drank
a
can
of
ale
,
he
set
out
for
my
master
's
house
,
with
a
heavy
heart
,
dreading
for
me
,
and
in
much
fear
of
being
brow
-
beaten
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
<EOS>
,
it
seems
,
asked
,
at
the
alehouse
,
what
family
the
"
squire
had
down
here
,
in
hopes
to
hear
something
of
me
:
<EOS>
And
they
said
,
A
housekeeper
,
two
maids
,
and
,
at
present
,
two
coachmen
,
and
two
grooms
,
a
footman
,
and
a
helper
.
 
<EOS>
Was
that
all
?
<EOS>
he
said
.
 
<EOS>
They
told
him
,
there
was
a
young
creature
there
,
belike
who
was
,
or
was
to
be
,
his
mistress
,
or
somewhat
of
that
nature
;
but
had
been
his
mother
's
waiting
-
maid
.
 
<EOS>
This
,
he
said
,
grieved
his
heart
,
and
confirmed
his
fears
.
  
<EOS>
So
he
went
on
,
and
about
three
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
came
to
the
gate
;
and
,
ringing
there
<EOS>
,
Sir
Simon
's
coachman
went
to
the
iron
gate
;
and
he
asked
for
the
housekeeper
;
though
,
from
what
I
had
written
,
in
his
heart
he
could
not
abide
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
sent
for
him
in
,
little
thinking
who
he
was
,
and
asked
him
,
in
the
little
hall
,
what
his
business
with
her
was
?
 
<EOS>
Only
,
madam
,
said
he
,
whether
I
can
not
speak
one
word
with
the
"
squire
?
 
<EOS>
No
,
friend
,
said
she
;
he
is
engaged
with
several
gentlemen
and
ladies
.
 
<EOS>
Said
he
<EOS>
,
I
have
business
with
his
honour
of
greater
consequence
to
me
than
either
life
or
death
;
and
tears
stood
in
his
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
At
that
she
went
into
the
great
parlour
,
where
my
master
was
talking
very
pleasantly
with
the
ladies
;
and
she
said
,
Sir
,
here
is
a
good
tight
old
man
,
that
wants
to
see
you
on
business
of
life
and
death
,
he
says
,
and
is
very
earnest
.
 
<EOS>
Ay
,
said
he
,
Who
can
that
be
?
 
<EOS>
Let
him
stay
in
the
little
hall
,
and
I
'll
come
to
him
presently
.
 
<EOS>
They
all
seemed
to
stare
;
and
Sir
Simon
said
,
No
more
nor
less
,
I
dare
say
,
my
good
friend
,
but
<EOS>
a
bastard
-
child
.
<EOS>
If
it
is
,
said
Lady
Jones
,
bring
it
in
to
us
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
,
said
he
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
tells
me
,
my
master
was
much
surprised
,
when
he
saw
who
it
was
;
and
she
much
more
,
when
my
dear
father
said
,
 
Good
God
!
<EOS>
give
me
patience
!
<EOS>
but
,
as
great
as
you
are
,
sir
,
I
must
ask
for
my
child
!
<EOS>
and
burst
out
into
tears
.
 
<EOS>
(
O
what
trouble
have
I
given
you
both
!
)
 
<EOS>
My
master
said
,
taking
him
by
the
hand
,
Do
n't
be
uneasy
,
Goodman
Andrews
;
your
daughter
is
in
the
way
to
be
happy
.
  
<EOS>
This
alarmed
my
dear
father
,
and
he
said
,
<EOS>
What
!
<EOS>
then
,
is
she
dying
?
 
<EOS>
And
trembled
,
he
could
scarce
stand
.
 
<EOS>
My
master
made
him
sit
down
,
and
sat
down
by
him
,
and
said
,
No
;
God
be
praised
!
<EOS>
she
is
very
well
:
And
pray
be
comforted
;
I
can
not
bear
to
see
you
thus
apprehensive
;
but
she
has
written
you
a
letter
to
assure
you
,
that
she
has
reason
to
be
well
satisfied
,
and
happy
.
  
<EOS>
Ah
,
sir
I
said
he
,
you
told
me
once
she
was
in
London
,
waiting
on
a
bishop
's
lady
,
when
all
the
time
she
was
a
severe
prisoner
here
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
that
's
all
over
now
,
Goodman
Andrews
,
said
my
master
:
<EOS>
but
the
times
are
altered
;
for
now
the
sweet
girl
has
taken
me
prisoner
;
and
in
a
few
days
I
shall
put
on
the
most
agreeable
fetters
that
ever
man
wore
.
  
<EOS>
O
,
sir
!
<EOS>
said
,
he
,
you
are
too
pleasant
for
my
griefs
.
 
<EOS>
My
heart
's
almost
broke
.
 
<EOS>
But
may
I
not
see
my
poor
child
?
 
<EOS>
You
shall
presently
,
said
he
;
for
she
is
coming
down
to
us
;
and
since
you
wo
n't
believe
me
,
I
hope
you
will
her
.
  
<EOS>
I
will
ask
you
,
good
sir
,
said
he
,
but
one
question
till
then
,
that
I
may
know
how
to
look
upon
her
when
I
see
her
.
 
<EOS>
Is
she
honest
?
 
<EOS>
Is
she
virtuous
?
 
<EOS>
As
the
new
-
born
babe
,
Mr.
Andrews
,
said
my
good
master
;
and
in
twelve
days
time
,
I
hope
,
will
be
my
wife
.
  
<EOS>
O
flatter
me
not
,
good
your
honour
,
said
he
:
It
can
not
be
!
<EOS>
it
can
not
be
!
  
<EOS>
I
 
fear
you
have
deluded
her
with
strange
hopes
;
and
would
make
me
believe
impossibilities
!
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
said
he
,
do
you
tell
my
dear
Pamela
's
good
father
,
when
I
go
out
,
all
you
know
concerning
me
,
and
your
mistress
that
is
to
be
.
 
<EOS>
Meantime
,
make
much
of
him
,
and
set
out
what
you
have
;
and
make
him
drink
a
glass
of
what
he
likes
best
.
 
<EOS>
If
this
be
wine
,
added
he
,
fill
me
a
bumper
.
  
<EOS>
She
did
so
;
and
he
took
my
father
by
the
hand
,
and
said
,
Believe
me
,
good
man
,
and
be
easy
;
for
I
ca
n't
bear
to
see
you
tortured
in
this
cruel
suspense
:
<EOS>
Your
dear
daughter
is
the
beloved
of
my
soul
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
glad
you
are
come
:
for
you
'll
see
us
all
in
the
same
story
.
 
<EOS>
And
here
's
your
dame
's
health
;
and
God
bless
you
both
,
for
being
the
happy
means
of
procuring
for
me
<EOS>
so
great
a
blessing
!
 
<EOS>
And
so
he
drank
a
bumper
to
this
most
obliging
health
.
  
<EOS>
What
do
I
hear
?
 
<EOS>
It
can
not
surely
be
!
<EOS>
said
my
father
.
 
<EOS>
And
your
honour
is
too
good
,
I
hope
,
to
mock
a
poor
old
man
 
<EOS>
This
ugly
story
,
sir
,
of
the
bishop
,
runs
in
my
head
 
<EOS>
But
you
say
I
shall
see
my
dear
child
 
<EOS>
And
I
shall
see
her
honest
.
 
<EOS>
If
not
,
poor
as
I
am
,
I
would
not
own
her
.
  
<EOS>
My
master
bid
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
not
to
let
me
know
yet
,
that
my
father
was
come
;
and
went
to
the
company
,
and
said
,
I
have
been
agreeably
surprised
:
<EOS>
Here
is
<EOS>
honest
old
Goodman
Andrews
come
full
of
grief
to
see
his
daughter
;
for
he
fears
she
is
seduced
;
and
tells
me
,
good
honest
man
,
that
,
poor
as
he
is
,
he
will
not
own
her
,
if
she
be
not
virtuous
.
 
<EOS>
O
,
said
they
all
,
with
one
voice
almost
,
Dear
sir
!
<EOS>
shall
we
not
see
the
good
old
man
you
have
so
praised
for
his
plain
good
sense
,
and
honest
heart
?
<EOS>
If
,
said
he
,
I
thought
Pamela
would
not
be
too
much
affected
with
the
surprise
,
I
would
make
you
all
witness
to
their
first
interview
;
for
never
did
daughter
love
a
father
,
or
a
father
a
daughter
,
as
they
two
do
one
another
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Darnford
,
and
all
the
ladies
,
and
the
gentlemen
too
,
begged
it
might
be
so
.
 
<EOS>
But
was
not
this
very
cruel
,
my
dear
mother
?
 
<EOS>
For
well
might
they
think
I
should
not
support
myself
in
such
an
agreeable
surprise
.
  
<EOS>
He
said
,
kindly
,
I
have
<EOS>
but
one
fear
,
that
the
dear
girl
may
be
too
much
affected
.
 
<EOS>
O
,
said
Lady
Darnford
,
we
'll
all
help
to
keep
up
her
spirits
.
<EOS>
Says
he
,
I
'll
go
up
,
and
prepare
her
;
but
wo
n't
tell
her
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
So
he
came
up
to
me
,
as
I
have
said
,
and
amused
me
about
Mr.
Williams
,
to
half
prepare
me
for
some
surprise
;
though
that
could
not
have
been
any
thing
to
this
:
and
he
left
me
,
as
I
said
,
in
that
suspense
,
at
his
mystical
words
,
saying
,
He
would
send
to
me
,
when
they
were
going
to
cards
.
  
<EOS>
My
master
went
from
me
to
my
father
,
and
asked
if
he
had
eaten
any
thing
.
<EOS>
No
,
said
Mrs.
Jewkes
;
the
good
man
's
heart
is
so
full
,
he
can
not
eat
,
nor
do
any
thing
,
till
he
has
seen
his
dear
daughter
.
 
<EOS>
That
shall
soon
be
,
said
my
master
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
have
you
come
in
with
me
;
for
she
is
going
to
sit
down
with
my
guests
,
to
a
game
at
quadrille
;
and
I
will
send
for
her
down
.
 
<EOS>
O
,
sir
,
said
my
father
,
do
n't
,
do
n't
let
me
;
I
am
not
fit
to
appear
before
your
guests
;
let
me
see
my
daughter
by
myself
,
I
beseech
you
.
 
<EOS>
Said
he
<EOS>
,
They
all
know
your
honest
character
,
Goodman
Andrews
,
and
long
to
see
you
,
for
Pamela
's
sake
.
  
<EOS>
So
he
took
my
father
by
the
hand
,
and
led
him
in
,
against
his
will
,
to
the
company
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
all
very
good
.
 
<EOS>
My
master
kindly
said
,
Ladies
and
gentlemen
,
I
present
to
you
one
of
the
honestest
men
in
England
,
my
good
Pamela
's
father
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Peters
went
to
him
,
and
took
him
by
the
hand
,
and
said
,
We
are
all
glad
to
see
you
,
sir
;
you
are
the
happiest
man
in
the
world
in
a
daughter
;
whom
we
never
saw
before
to
-
day
,
but
can
not
enough
admire
.
  
<EOS>
Said
my
master
,
This
gentleman
,
Goodman
Andrews
,
is
the
minister
of
the
parish
;
but
is
not
young
enough
for
Mr.
Williams
.
 
<EOS>
This
airy
expression
,
my
poor
father
said
,
made
him
fear
,
for
a
moment
,
that
all
was
a
jest
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Simon
also
took
him
by
the
hand
,
and
said
,
Ay
,
you
have
a
sweet
daughter
,
Honesty
;
we
are
all
in
love
with
her
.
 
<EOS>
And
the
ladies
came
,
and
said
very
fine
things
:
<EOS>
Lady
Darnford
particularly
,
That
he
might
think
himself
the
happiest
man
in
England
,
in
such
a
daughter
.
 
<EOS>
If
,
and
please
you
,
madam
,
said
he
,
she
be
but
virtuous
,
'
tis
all
in
all
:
For
all
the
rest
is
accident
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
doubt
his
honour
has
been
too
much
upon
the
jest
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
said
Mrs.
Peters
,
we
are
all
witnesses
,
that
he
intends
very
honourably
by
her
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
some
comfort
,
said
he
,
and
wiped
his
eyes
,
that
such
good
ladies
say
so
 
<EOS>
But
I
wish
I
could
see
her
.
  
<EOS>
They
would
have
had
him
sit
down
by
them
;
but
he
would
only
sit
behind
the
door
,
in
the
corner
of
the
room
,
so
that
one
could
not
soon
see
him
as
one
came
in
;
because
the
door
opened
against
him
,
and
hid
him
almost
.
<EOS>
The
ladies
all
sat
down
;
and
my
master
said
,
Desire
Mrs.
Jewkes
to
step
up
,
and
tell
Mrs.
Andrews
the
ladies
wait
for
her
.
 
<EOS>
So
down
I
came
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Darnford
rose
,
and
met
me
at
the
door
,
and
said
,
Well
,
Miss
Andrews
,
we
longed
for
your
company
.
 
<EOS>
I
did
not
see
my
dear
father
;
and
it
seems
his
heart
was
too
full
to
speak
;
and
he
got
up
,
and
sat
down
three
or
four
times
successively
,
unable
to
come
to
me
,
or
to
say
any
thing
.
 
<EOS>
The
ladies
looked
that
way
:
but
I
would
not
,
supposing
it
was
Mr.
Williams
.
<EOS>
And
they
made
me
sit
down
between
Lady
Darnford
and
Lady
Jones
;
and
asked
me
,
what
we
should
play
at
?
 
<EOS>
I
said
,
At
what
your
ladyships
please
.
 
<EOS>
I
wondered
to
see
them
smile
,
and
look
upon
me
,
and
to
that
corner
of
the
room
;
but
I
was
afraid
of
looking
that
way
,
for
fear
of
seeing
Mr.
Williams
;
though
my
face
was
that
way
too
,
and
the
table
before
me
.
  
<EOS>
Said
my
master
,
Did
you
send
your
letter
away
to
the
posthouse
,
my
good
girl
,
for
your
father
?
 
<EOS>
To
be
sure
,
sir
,
said
I
,
I
did
not
forget
that
:
I
took
the
liberty
to
desire
Mr.
Thomas
to
carry
it
.
 
<EOS>
What
,
said
he
,
I
wonder
,
will
the
good
old
couple
say
to
it
?
 
<EOS>
O
sir
,
said
I
,
your
goodness
will
be
a
cordial
to
their
dear
honest
hearts
!
 
<EOS>
At
that
,
my
dear
father
,
not
able
to
contain
himself
,
nor
yet
to
stir
from
the
place
,
gushed
out
into
a
flood
of
tears
,
which
he
,
good
soul
!
had
been
struggling
with
,
it
seems
;
and
cried
out
,
O
my
dear
child
!
  
<EOS>
I
knew
the
voice
,
and
,
lifting
up
my
eyes
,
and
seeing
my
father
,
gave
a
spring
,
overturned
the
table
,
without
regard
to
the
company
,
and
threw
myself
at
his
feet
:
O
my
father
!
<EOS>
my
father
!
<EOS>
said
I
,
can
it
be
?
 
<EOS>
Is
it
you
?
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
it
is
!
<EOS>
it
is
!
 
<EOS>
O
bless
your
happy
daughter
!
 
<EOS>
I
would
have
said
,
and
down
I
sunk
.
  
<EOS>
My
master
seemed
concerned
 
I
feared
,
said
he
,
that
the
surprise
would
be
too
much
for
her
spirits
;
and
all
the
ladies
ran
to
me
,
and
made
me
drink
a
glass
of
water
;
and
I
found
myself
encircled
in
the
arms
of
my
dearest
father
.
 
<EOS>
O
tell
me
,
said
I
,
every
thing
!
 
<EOS>
How
long
have
you
been
here
?
<EOS>
When
did
you
come
?
 
<EOS>
How
does
my
honoured
mother
?
 
<EOS>
And
half
a
dozen
questions
more
,
before
he
could
answer
one
.
  
<EOS>
They
permitted
me
to
retire
with
my
father
;
and
then
I
poured
forth
all
my
vows
and
thanksgivings
to
God
for
this
additional
blessing
;
and
confirmed
all
my
master
's
goodness
to
his
scarce
-
believing
amazement
.
<EOS>
And
we
kneeled
together
,
blessing
God
,
and
one
another
,
for
several
ecstatic
minutes
and
my
master
coming
in
soon
after
,
my
dear
father
said
,
O
sir
,
what
a
change
is
this
!
 
<EOS>
May
,
God
reward
and
bless
you
,
both
in
this
world
and
the
next
!
  
<EOS>
May
God
bless
us
all
!
<EOS>
said
he
.
 
<EOS>
But
how
does
my
sweet
girl
?
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
in
pain
for
you
 
<EOS>
I
am
sorry
I
did
not
apprise
you
beforehand
.
  
<EOS>
O
sir
,
said
I
,
it
was
you
;
and
all
you
do
must
be
good
 
<EOS>
But
this
was
a
blessing
so
unexpected
!
<EOS>
#
#
#
#
  
<EOS>
Well
,
said
he
,
you
have
given
pain
to
all
the
company
.
 
<EOS>
They
will
be
glad
to
see
you
,
when
you
can
:
for
you
have
spoiled
all
their
diversion
;
and
yet
painfully
delighted
them
at
the
same
time
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Andrews
,
added
he
<EOS>
,
do
you
make
this
house
your
own
;
and
the
longer
you
stay
,
<EOS>
the
more
welcome
you
'll
be
.
 
<EOS>
After
you
have
a
little
composed
yourself
,
my
dear
girl
,
step
in
to
us
again
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
glad
to
see
you
so
well
already
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
he
left
us
.
  
<EOS>
See
you
,
my
dear
father
,
said
I
,
what
goodness
there
is
in
this
once
naughty
master
!
 
<EOS>
O
pray
for
him
!
<EOS>
and
pray
for
me
,
that
I
may
deserve
it
!
  
<EOS>
How
long
has
this
happy
change
been
wrought
,
my
dear
child
?
 
<EOS>
O
,
said
I
,
several
happy
days
!
 
<EOS>
I
have
written
down
every
thing
;
and
you
'll
see
,
from
the
depth
of
misery
,
what
God
has
done
for
your
happy
daughter
!
  
<EOS>
Blessed
be
his
name
!
<EOS>
said
he
.
 
<EOS>
But
do
you
say
he
will
marry
you
?
 
<EOS>
Can
it
be
,
that
such
a
brave
gentleman
will
make
a
lady
of
the
child
of
such
a
poor
man
as
I
?
 
<EOS>
O
the
divine
goodness
!
 
<EOS>
How
will
your
poor
dear
mother
be
able
to
support
these
happy
tidings
?
 
<EOS>
I
will
set
out
to
-
morrow
,
to
acquaint
her
with
them
:
for
I
am
but
half
happy
,
till
the
dear
good
woman
shares
them
with
me
!
 
<EOS>
To
be
sure
,
my
dear
child
,
we
ought
to
go
into
some
far
country
to
hide
ourselves
,
that
we
may
not
disgrace
you
by
our
poverty
!
  
<EOS>
O
,
my
dear
father
,
said
I
,
now
you
are
unkind
for
the
first
time
!
 
<EOS>
Your
poverty
has
been
my
glory
,
and
my
riches
;
and
I
have
nothing
to
brag
of
,
but
that
I
ever
thought
it
an
honour
,
rather
than
a
disgrace
;
because
you
were
always
so
honest
,
that
your
child
might
well
boast
of
such
a
parentage
!
  
<EOS>
In
this
manner
,
my
dear
mother
,
did
we
pass
the
happy
moments
,
till
Miss
Darnford
came
to
me
,
and
said
,
How
do
you
do
,
dear
madam
?
 
<EOS>
I
rejoice
to
see
you
so
well
!
 
<EOS>
Pray
let
us
have
your
company
.
 
<EOS>
And
yours
too
,
good
Mr.
Andrews
,
taking
his
hand
.
  
<EOS>
This
was
very
obliging
,
I
told
her
;
and
we
went
to
the
great
parlour
;
and
my
master
took
my
father
by
the
hand
,
and
made
him
sit
down
by
him
,
and
drink
a
glass
of
wine
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
Mean
-
time
,
I
made
my
excuses
to
the
ladies
,
as
well
as
I
could
,
which
they
readily
granted
me
.
 
<EOS>
But
Sir
Simon
,
after
his
comical
manner
,
put
his
hands
on
my
shoulders
:
<EOS>
Let
me
see
,
let
me
see
,
said
he
,
where
your
wings
grow
;
for
I
never
saw
any
body
fly
like
you
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
said
he
,
you
have
broken
Lady
Jones
's
shins
with
the
table
.
 
<EOS>
Shew
her
else
,
madam
.
  
<EOS>
His
pleasantry
made
them
laugh
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
said
,
I
was
very
sorry
for
my
extravagancy
:
and
if
it
had
not
been
my
master
's
doings
,
I
should
have
said
,
it
was
a
fault
to
permit
me
to
be
surprised
,
and
put
out
of
myself
,
before
such
good
company
.
 
<EOS>
They
said
,
All
was
very
excusable
;
and
they
were
glad
I
suffered
no
more
by
it
.
  
<EOS>
They
were
so
kind
as
to
excuse
me
at
cards
,
and
played
by
themselves
;
and
I
went
by
my
master
's
commands
and
sat
on
the
other
side
,
in
the
happiest
place
I
ever
was
blest
with
,
between
two
of
the
dearest
men
in
the
world
to
me
,
and
each
holding
one
of
my
hands
:
 
my
father
,
every
now
and
then
,
with
tears
,
lifting
up
his
eyes
,
and
saying
,
Could
I
ever
have
hoped
this
!
  
<EOS>
I
asked
him
,
If
he
had
been
so
kind
as
to
bring
the
papers
with
him
?
 
<EOS>
He
said
,
He
had
;
and
looked
at
me
,
as
who
should
say
,
Must
I
give
them
to
you
now
?
 
<EOS>
I
said
,
Be
pleased
to
let
me
have
them
.
 
<EOS>
He
pulled
them
from
his
pocket
;
and
I
stood
up
,
and
,
with
my
best
duty
,
gave
them
into
my
master
's
hands
.
 
<EOS>
He
said
,
Thank
you
,
Pamela
.
 
<EOS>
Your
father
shall
take
all
with
him
,
so
see
what
a
sad
fellow
I
have
been
,
as
well
as
the
present
happier
alteration
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
must
have
them
all
again
,
for
the
writer
's
sake
.
  
<EOS>
The
ladies
and
gentlemen
would
make
me
govern
the
tea
-
table
,
whatever
I
could
do
;
and
Abraham
attended
me
,
to
serve
the
company
.
 
<EOS>
My
master
and
my
father
sat
together
,
and
drank
a
glass
or
two
of
wine
instead
of
tea
,
and
Sir
Simon
joked
with
my
master
,
saying
,
I
warrant
you
would
not
be
such
a
woman
's
man
,
as
to
drink
tea
,
for
ever
so
much
,
with
the
ladies
.
<EOS>
But
your
time
's
coming
,
and
I
doubt
not
you
'll
be
made
as
comfortable
as
I.
  
<EOS>
My
master
was
very
urgent
with
them
to
stay
supper
;
and
at
last
they
complied
,
on
condition
that
I
would
grace
the
table
,
as
they
were
pleased
to
call
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
begged
to
be
excused
.
 
<EOS>
My
master
said
,
Do
n't
be
excused
,
Pamela
,
since
the
ladies
desire
it
:
And
besides
,
said
he
,
we
wo
n't
part
with
your
father
;
and
so
you
may
as
well
stay
with
us
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
in
hopes
<EOS>
my
father
and
I
might
sup
by
ourselves
,
or
only
with
Mrs.
Jewkes
.
 
<EOS>
And
Miss
Darnford
,
who
is
a
most
obliging
young
lady
,
said
,
We
will
not
part
with
you
,
indeed
we
wo
n't
.
  
<EOS>
When
supper
was
brought
in
,
Lady
Darnford
took
me
by
the
hand
,
and
said
to
my
master
,
Sir
,
by
your
leave
;
and
would
have
placed
me
at
the
upper
end
of
the
table
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
,
pray
,
madam
,
said
I
,
excuse
me
;
I
can
not
do
it
,
indeed
I
can
not
.
 
<EOS>
Pamela
,
said
my
master
,
to
the
great
delight
of
my
good
father
,
as
I
could
see
by
his
looks
,
oblige
Lady
Darnford
,
since
she
desires
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
but
a
little
before
your
time
,
you
know
.
  
<EOS>
Dear
,
good
sir
,
said
I
,
pray
do
n't
command
it
!
 
<EOS>
Let
me
sit
by
my
father
,
pray
!
 
<EOS>
Why
,
said
Sir
Simon
,
here
's
ado
indeed
!
 
<EOS>
Sit
down
at
the
upper
end
,
as
you
should
do
;
and
your
father
shall
sit
by
you
,
there
.
 
<EOS>
This
put
my
dear
father
upon
difficulties
.
 
<EOS>
And
my
master
said
,
Come
<EOS>
,
I
'll
place
you
all
:
and
so
put
Lady
Darnford
at
the
upper
end
,
Lady
Jones
at
her
right
hand
,
and
Mrs.
Peters
on
the
other
;
and
he
placed
me
between
the
two
young
ladies
;
but
very
genteelly
put
Miss
Darnford
below
her
younger
sister
;
saying
,
Come
,
miss
,
I
put
you
here
,
because
you
shall
hedge
in
this
little
cuckow
;
for
I
take
notice
,
with
pleasure
,
of
your
goodness
to
her
;
and
,
besides
,
all
you
very
young
ladies
should
sit
together
.
 
<EOS>
This
seemed
to
please
both
sisters
;
for
had
the
youngest
miss
been
put
there
,
it
might
have
piqued
her
,
as
matters
have
been
formerly
,
to
be
placed
below
me
;
whereas
Miss
Darnford
giving
place
to
her
youngest
sister
,
made
it
less
odd
<EOS>
she
should
to
me
;
especially
with
that
handsome
turn
of
the
dear
man
,
as
if
I
was
a
cuckow
,
and
to
be
hedged
in
.
  
<EOS>
My
master
kindly
said
,
Come
,
Mr.
Andrews
,
you
and
I
will
sit
together
.
<EOS>
And
so
took
his
place
at
the
bottom
of
the
table
,
and
set
my
father
on
his
right
hand
;
and
Sir
Simon
would
sit
on
his
left
.
 
<EOS>
For
,
said
he
,
parson
<EOS>
,
I
think
the
petticoats
should
sit
together
;
and
so
do
you
sit
down
by
that
lady
(
his
sister
)
.
 
<EOS>
A
boiled
turkey
standing
by
me
<EOS>
,
my
master
said
,
Cut
up
that
turkey
,
Pamela
,
if
it
be
not
too
strong
work
for
you
,
that
Lady
Darnford
may
not
have
too
much
trouble
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
carved
it
in
a
trice
,
and
helped
the
ladies
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Darnford
said
,
I
would
give
something
to
be
so
dexterous
a
carver
.
 
<EOS>
O
madam
,
said
I
,
my
late
good
lady
would
always
make
me
do
these
things
,
when
she
entertained
her
female
friends
,
as
she
used
to
do
on
particular
days
.
  
<EOS>
Ay
,
said
my
master
,
I
remember
my
poor
mother
would
often
say
,
if
I
,
or
any
body
at
table
,
happened
to
be
a
little
out
in
carving
,
I
'll
send
up
for
my
Pamela
,
to
shew
you
how
to
carve
.
 
<EOS>
Said
Lady
Jones
,
Mrs.
Andrews
has
every
accomplishment
of
her
sex
.
 
<EOS>
She
is
quite
wonderful
for
her
years
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Darnford
said
,
And
I
can
tell
you
,
madam
,
that
she
plays
sweetly
upon
the
spinnet
,
and
sings
as
sweetly
to
it
;
for
she
has
a
fine
voice
.
 
<EOS>
Foolish
!
<EOS>
said
Sir
Simon
;
who
,
that
hears
her
speak
,
knows
not
that
?
 
<EOS>
And
who
that
sees
her
fingers
,
believes
not
that
they
were
made
to
touch
any
key
?
 
<EOS>
O
,
parson
!
<EOS>
said
he
,
'
tis
<EOS>
well
you
're
by
,
or
I
should
have
had
a
blush
from
the
ladies
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
not
,
Sir
Simon
,
said
Lady
Jones
;
for
a
gentleman
of
your
politeness
would
not
say
any
thing
that
would
make
ladies
blush
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
no
,
said
he
,
for
the
world
:
<EOS>
but
if
I
had
,
it
would
have
been
,
as
the
poet
says
,
      
<EOS>
"
They
blush
,
because
they
understand
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
When
the
company
went
away
,
Lady
Darnford
,
Lady
Jones
,
and
Mrs.
Peters
,
severally
invited
my
master
,
and
me
with
him
,
to
their
houses
;
and
begged
he
would
permit
me
,
at
least
,
to
come
before
we
left
those
parts
.
<EOS>
And
they
said
,
We
hope
,
when
the
happy
knot
is
tied
,
you
will
induce
Mr.
B
#
#
#
#
to
reside
more
among
us
.
 
<EOS>
We
were
always
glad
,
said
Lady
Darnford
,
when
he
was
here
;
but
now
shall
have
double
reason
.
 
<EOS>
O
what
grateful
things
were
these
to
the
ears
of
my
good
father
!
  
<EOS>
When
the
company
was
gone
,
my
master
asked
my
father
,
if
he
smoked
?
 
<EOS>
He
answered
,
No
.
 
<EOS>
He
made
us
both
sit
down
by
him
,
and
said
,
I
have
been
telling
this
sweet
girl
,
that
in
fourteen
days
,
and
two
of
them
are
gone
,
she
must
fix
on
one
to
make
me
happy
.
 
<EOS>
And
have
left
it
to
her
to
choose
either
one
of
the
first
or
last
seven
.
 
<EOS>
My
father
held
up
his
hands
,
and
eyes
;
God
bless
your
honour
!
<EOS>
said
he
,
is
all
I
can
say
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
Pamela
,
said
my
master
,
taking
my
hand
,
do
n't
let
a
little
wrong
-
timed
bashfulness
take
place
,
without
any
other
reason
,
because
I
should
be
glad
to
go
to
Bedfordshire
as
soon
as
I
could
;
and
I
would
not
return
till
I
carry
my
servants
there
a
mistress
,
who
should
assist
me
to
repair
the
mischiefs
she
has
made
in
it
.
  
<EOS>
I
could
not
look
up
for
confusion
.
 
<EOS>
And
my
father
said
,
<EOS>
My
dear
child
,
I
need
not
,
I
am
sure
,
prompt
your
obedience
in
whatever
will
most
oblige
so
good
a
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
What
says
my
Pamela
?
<EOS>
said
my
master
:
<EOS>
She
does
not
use
to
be
at
a
loss
for
expressions
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
said
I
,
were
I
too
sudden
,
it
would
look
as
if
I
doubted
whether
you
would
hold
in
your
mind
,
and
was
not
willing
to
give
you
time
for
reflection
:
but
otherwise
,
to
be
sure
I
ought
to
resign
myself
implicitly
to
your
will
.
 
<EOS>
Said
he
<EOS>
,
I
want
not
time
for
reflection
:
for
I
have
often
told
you
,
and
that
long
ago
,
I
could
not
live
without
you
:
and
my
pride
of
condition
made
me
both
tempt
and
terrify
you
to
other
terms
;
but
your
virtue
was
proof
against
all
temptations
,
and
was
not
to
be
awed
by
terrors
:
<EOS>
Wherefore
,
as
I
could
not
conquer
my
passion
for
you
,
I
corrected
myself
,
and
resolved
,
since
you
would
not
be
mine
upon
my
terms
,
you
should
upon
your
own
:
<EOS>
and
now
I
desire
you
not
on
any
other
,
I
assure
you
:
and
<EOS>
I
think
the
sooner
it
is
done
,
the
better
.
 
<EOS>
What
say
you
,
Mr.
Andrews
?
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
said
he
,
there
is
so
much
goodness
on
your
side
,
and
,
blessed
be
God
!
<EOS>
so
much
prudence
on
my
daughter
's
,
that
I
must
be
quite
silent
.
 
<EOS>
But
when
it
is
done
,
I
and
my
poor
wife
shall
have
nothing
to
do
,
but
to
pray
for
you
both
,
and
to
look
back
,
with
wonder
and
joy
,
on
the
ways
of
Providence
.
  
<EOS>
This
,
said
my
master
,
is
Friday
night
;
and
suppose
,
my
girl
,
it
be
next
Monday
,
Tuesday
,
Wednesday
,
or
Thursday
morning
?
 
<EOS>
Say
,
my
Pamela
.
  
<EOS>
Will
you
,
sir
,
said
I
,
excuse
me
till
to
-
morrow
for
an
answer
?
 
<EOS>
I
will
,
said
he
;
and
touched
the
bell
,
and
called
for
Mrs.
Jewkes
.
 
<EOS>
Where
,
said
he
,
does
Mr.
Andrews
lie
tonight
?
 
<EOS>
You
'll
take
care
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
's
a
very
good
man
;
and
will
bring
a
blessing
upon
every
house
he
sets
his
foot
in
.
  
<EOS>
My
dear
father
wept
for
joy
;
and
I
could
not
refrain
keeping
him
company
.
<EOS>
And
my
master
,
saluting
me
,
bid
us
good
night
,
and
retired
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
waited
upon
my
dear
father
,
and
was
so
full
of
prattle
,
of
my
master
's
goodness
,
and
my
future
prospects
,
that
I
believed
afterwards
<EOS>
I
was
turned
all
into
tongue
:
but
he
indulged
me
,
and
was
transported
with
joy
;
and
went
to
bed
,
and
dreamed
of
nothing
but
Jacob
's
ladder
,
and
angels
ascending
and
descending
,
to
bless
him
and
his
daughter
.
  
<EOS>
Saturday
.
  
<EOS>
I
arose
early
in
the
morning
;
but
found
my
father
was
up
before
me
,
and
was
gone
to
walk
in
the
garden
.
 
<EOS>
I
went
to
him
:
<EOS>
and
with
what
delight
,
with
what
thankfulness
,
did
we
go
over
every
scene
of
it
,
that
had
before
been
so
dreadful
to
me
!
 
<EOS>
The
fish
-
pond
,
the
back
-
door
,
and
every
place
.
<EOS>
O
what
reason
had
we
for
thankfulness
and
gratitude
!
  
<EOS>
About
seven
o'clock
<EOS>
my
good
master
joined
us
,
in
his
morning
gown
and
slippers
;
and
looking
a
little
heavy
<EOS>
,
I
said
,
Sir
,
I
fear
you
had
not
good
rest
last
night
.
 
<EOS>
That
is
your
fault
,
Pamela
,
said
he
.
 
<EOS>
After
I
went
from
you
,
I
must
needs
look
into
your
papers
,
and
could
not
leave
them
till
I
had
read
them
through
;
and
so
'
twas
three
o'clock
before
I
went
to
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
,
sir
,
said
I
,
you
had
had
better
entertainment
.
 
<EOS>
The
worst
part
of
it
,
said
he
,
was
what
I
had
brought
upon
myself
;
and
you
have
not
spared
me
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
said
I
 
<EOS>
He
interrupting
me
,
said
,
Well
,
I
forgive
you
.
<EOS>
You
had
too
much
reason
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
find
,
plainly
enough
,
that
if
you
had
got
away
,
you
would
soon
have
been
Williams
's
wife
:
and
I
ca
n't
see
how
it
could
well
have
been
otherwise
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
sir
,
said
I
,
I
had
no
notion
of
it
,
or
of
being
any
body
's
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
so
,
said
he
;
but
it
must
have
come
as
a
thing
of
course
;
and
I
see
your
father
was
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
said
he
,
I
little
thought
of
the
honour
your
goodness
would
confer
upon
her
;
and
I
thought
that
would
be
a
match
above
what
we
could
do
for
her
,
a
great
deal
.
 
<EOS>
But
when
I
found
she
was
not
for
it
,
I
resolved
not
to
urge
her
;
but
leave
all
to
her
own
prudence
.
  
<EOS>
I
see
,
said
he
,
<EOS>
all
was
sincere
,
honest
,
and
open
;
and
I
speak
of
it
,
if
it
had
been
done
,
as
a
thing
that
could
hardly
well
be
avoided
;
and
I
am
quite
satisfied
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
said
he
,
I
must
observe
,
as
I
have
a
hundred
times
,
with
admiration
,
what
a
prodigious
memory
,
and
easy
and
happy
manner
of
narration
,
this
excellent
girl
has
!
 
<EOS>
And
though
she
is
full
of
her
pretty
tricks
and
artifices
,
to
escape
the
snares
I
had
laid
for
her
,
yet
all
is
innocent
,
lovely
,
and
uniformly
beautiful
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
exceedingly
happy
in
a
daughter
;
and
I
hope
I
shall
be
so
in
a
wife
 
<EOS>
Or
,
said
my
father
,
may
she
not
have
that
honour
!
 
<EOS>
I
fear
it
not
,
said
he
;
and
I
hope
I
shall
deserve
it
of
her
.
  
<EOS>
But
,
Pamela
,
said
my
master
,
I
am
sorry
to
find
in
some
parts
of
your
journal
,
that
Mrs.
Jewkes
carried
her
orders
a
little
too
far
:
and
I
the
more
take
notice
of
it
,
because
you
have
not
complained
to
me
of
her
behaviour
,
as
she
might
have
expected
for
some
parts
of
it
;
though
a
good
deal
was
occasioned
by
my
strict
orders
.
 
<EOS>
But
she
had
the
insolence
to
strike
my
girl
,
I
find
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
said
I
,
I
was
a
little
provoking
,
I
believe
;
but
as
we
forgave
one
another
,
I
was
the
less
entitled
to
complain
of
her
.
  
<EOS>
Well
,
said
he
,
you
are
very
good
;
but
if
you
have
any
particular
resentment
,
I
will
indulge
it
so
far
,
as
that
she
shall
hereafter
have
nothing
to
do
where
you
are
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
said
I
,
you
are
so
kind
,
that
I
ought
to
forgive
every
body
;
and
when
I
see
that
my
happiness
is
brought
about
by
the
very
means
that
I
thought
then
my
greatest
grievance
,
I
ought
to
bless
those
means
,
and
forgive
all
that
was
disagreeable
to
me
at
the
same
time
,
for
the
great
good
that
hath
issued
from
it
.
 
<EOS>
That
,
said
he
,
and
kissed
me
,
is
sweetly
considered
!
<EOS>
and
it
shall
be
my
part
to
make
you
amends
for
what
you
have
suffered
,
that
you
may
still
think
lighter
of
the
one
,
and
have
cause
to
rejoice
in
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
My
dear
father
's
heart
was
full
;
and
he
said
,
with
his
hands
folded
,
and
lifted
up
,
Pray
,
sir
,
let
me
go
 
<EOS>
let
me
go
 
to
my
dear
wife
,
and
tell
her
all
these
blessed
things
,
while
my
heart
holds
;
for
it
is
ready
to
burst
with
joy
!
 
<EOS>
Good
man
!
<EOS>
said
my
master
 
I
hope
to
hear
this
honest
heart
of
yours
speaking
at
your
lips
.
 
<EOS>
I
enjoin
you
,
Pamela
,
to
continue
your
relation
,
as
you
have
opportunity
;
and
though
your
father
be
here
,
write
to
your
mother
,
that
this
wondrous
story
be
perfect
,
and
we
,
your
friends
,
may
read
and
admire
you
more
and
more
.
 
<EOS>
Ay
,
pray
,
pray
do
,
my
child
,
said
my
father
;
and
this
is
the
reason
that
I
write
on
,
my
dear
mother
,
when
I
thought
not
to
do
it
,
because
my
father
could
tell
you
all
that
passed
while
he
was
here
.
  
<EOS>
My
master
took
notice
of
my
psalm
,
and
was
pleased
to
commend
it
;
and
said
,
That
I
had
very
charitably
turned
the
last
verses
,
which
,
in
the
original
,
were
full
of
heavy
curses
,
to
a
wish
that
shewed
I
was
not
of
an
implacable
disposition
though
my
then
usage
might
have
excused
it
,
if
I
had
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
said
he
<EOS>
,
I
think
you
shall
sing
it
to
me
to
-
morrow
.
  
<EOS>
After
we
have
breakfasted
,
added
he
,
if
you
have
no
objection
,
Pamela
,
we
'll
take
an
airing
together
;
and
it
shall
be
in
the
coach
,
because
we
'll
have
your
father
's
company
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
have
excused
himself
;
but
my
master
would
have
it
so
:
but
he
was
much
ashamed
,
because
of
the
meanness
of
his
appearance
.
  
<EOS>
My
master
would
make
us
both
breakfast
with
him
on
chocolate
;
and
he
said
,
I
would
have
you
,
Pamela
,
begin
to
dress
as
you
used
to
do
;
for
now
,
at
least
,
you
may
call
your
two
other
bundles
your
own
;
and
if
you
want
any
thing
against
the
approaching
occasion
,
private
as
I
design
it
,
I
'll
send
to
Lincoln
for
it
,
by
a
special
messenger
.
 
<EOS>
I
said
,
My
good
lady
's
bounty
,
and
his
own
,
had
set
me
much
above
my
degree
,
and
I
had
very
good
things
of
all
sorts
;
and
I
did
not
desire
any
other
,
because
I
would
not
excite
the
censure
of
the
ladies
.
 
<EOS>
That
would
be
a
different
thing
,
he
was
pleased
to
say
,
when
he
publicly
owned
his
nuptials
,
after
we
came
to
the
other
house
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
at
present
,
if
I
was
satisfied
,
he
would
not
make
words
with
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
hope
,
Mr.
Andrews
,
said
he
,
to
my
father
,
you
'll
not
leave
us
till
you
see
the
affair
over
,
and
then
you
'll
be
sure
I
mean
honourably
:
and
,
besides
,
Pamela
will
be
induced
to
set
the
day
sooner
.
 
<EOS>
O
,
sir
,
said
he
,
I
bless
God
I
have
no
reason
to
doubt
your
meaning
honourably
:
<EOS>
and
I
hope
you
'll
excuse
me
,
if
I
set
out
on
Monday
morning
,
very
early
,
to
my
dear
wife
,
and
make
her
as
happy
as
I
am
.
  
<EOS>
Why
,
Pamela
,
says
my
good
master
,
may
it
not
be
performed
on
Tuesday
?
<EOS>
And
then
your
father
,
maybe
,
will
stay
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
have
been
glad
to
have
had
it
to
-
morrow
,
added
he
;
but
I
have
sent
Monsieur
Colbrand
for
a
license
,
that
,
you
may
have
no
scruple
unanswered
;
and
he
ca
n't
very
well
be
back
before
to
-
morrow
night
,
or
Monday
morning
.
  
<EOS>
This
was
most
agreeable
news
.
 
<EOS>
I
said
,
<EOS>
Sir
,
I
know
my
dear
father
will
want
to
be
at
home
:
and
as
you
was
so
good
to
give
me
a
fortnight
from
last
Thursday
,
I
should
be
glad
you
would
be
pleased
to
indulge
me
still
to
some
day
in
the
second
seven
.
  
<EOS>
Well
,
said
he
,
I
will
not
be
too
urgent
;
but
the
sooner
you
fix
,
the
better
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Andrews
,
we
must
leave
something
to
these
Jephthah
's
daughters
,
in
these
cases
,
he
was
pleased
to
say
:
I
suppose
the
little
bashful
folly
,
which
,
in
the
happiest
circumstances
,
may
give
a
kind
of
regret
to
quit
the
maiden
state
,
and
an
awkwardness
at
the
entrance
into
a
new
one
,
is
a
reason
with
Pamela
;
and
so
she
shall
name
her
day
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
said
he
,
you
are
all
goodness
.
  
<EOS>
I
went
up
soon
after
,
and
new
dressed
myself
,
taking
possession
,
in
a
happy
moment
<EOS>
,
I
hope
,
of
my
two
bundles
,
as
my
good
master
was
pleased
to
call
them
;
(
alluding
to
my
former
division
of
those
good
things
my
lady
and
himself
bestowed
upon
me
;
)
and
so
put
on
fine
linen
,
silk
shoes
,
and
fine
white
cotton
stockings
,
a
fine
quilted
coat
,
a
delicate
green
Mantea
silk
gown
and
coat
,
a
French
necklace
,
and
a
laced
cambric
handkerchief
,
and
clean
gloves
;
and
,
taking
my
fan
in
my
hand
,
I
,
like
a
little
proud
hussy
,
looked
in
the
glass
,
and
thought
myself
a
gentlewoman
once
more
;
but
I
forgot
not
to
return
due
thanks
,
for
being
able
to
put
on
this
dress
with
so
much
comfort
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
would
help
to
dress
me
,
and
complimented
me
highly
,
saying
,
among
other
things
,
That
now
I
looked
like
a
lady
indeed
:
and
as
,
she
said
,
the
little
chapel
was
ready
,
and
divine
service
would
be
read
in
it
to
-
morrow
<EOS>
,
she
wished
the
happy
knot
might
then
be
tied
.
 
<EOS>
Said
she
<EOS>
,
Have
you
not
seen
the
chapel
,
madam
,
since
it
has
been
cleaned
out
?
 
<EOS>
No
,
said
I
;
but
are
we
to
have
service
in
it
to
-
morrow
,
do
you
say
?
 
<EOS>
I
am
glad
of
that
;
for
I
have
been
a
sad
heathen
lately
,
sore
against
my
will
!
 
<EOS>
But
who
is
to
officiate
?
 
<EOS>
Somebody
,
replied
she
,
Mr.
Peters
will
send
.
 
<EOS>
You
tell
me
very
good
news
,
said
I
,
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
<EOS>
:
I
hope
it
will
never
be
a
lumber
-
room
again
.
 
<EOS>
Ay
,
said
she
,
I
can
tell
you
more
good
news
;
for
the
two
Misses
Darnford
,
and
Lady
Jones
,
are
to
be
here
at
the
opening
of
it
;
and
will
stay
and
dine
with
you
.
 
<EOS>
My
master
,
said
I
,
has
not
told
me
that
.
 
<EOS>
You
must
alter
your
style
,
madam
,
said
she
:
<EOS>
It
must
not
be
master
now
,
sure
!
 
<EOS>
O
,
returned
I
,
this
is
a
language
I
shall
never
forget
:
he
shall
always
be
my
master
;
and
I
shall
think
myself
more
and
more
his
servant
.
  
<EOS>
My
poor
father
did
not
know
I
went
up
to
dress
myself
;
and
he
said
his
heart
misgave
him
when
he
saw
me
first
,
for
fear
I
was
made
a
fool
of
,
and
that
here
was
some
fine
lady
that
was
to
be
my
master
's
true
wife
.
<EOS>
And
he
stood
in
admiration
,
and
said
,
O
,
my
dear
child
,
how
well
will
you
become
your
happy
condition
!
 
<EOS>
Why
you
look
like
a
lady
already
!
 
<EOS>
I
hope
,
my
dear
father
,
said
I
,
and
boldly
kissed
him
<EOS>
,
I
shall
always
be
your
dutiful
daughter
,
whatever
my
condition
be
.
  
<EOS>
My
master
sent
me
word
he
was
ready
;
and
when
he
saw
me
,
said
,
Dress
as
you
will
,
Pamela
,
you
're
a
charming
girl
!
<EOS>
and
so
handed
me
to
the
coach
,
and
would
make
my
father
and
me
sit
both
on
the
foreside
,
and
sat
backwards
,
over
against
me
;
and
bid
the
coachman
drive
to
the
meadow
;
that
is
,
where
he
once
met
Mr.
Williams
.
  
<EOS>
The
conversation
was
most
agreeable
to
me
,
and
to
my
dear
father
,
as
we
went
;
and
he
more
and
more
exceeded
in
goodness
and
generosity
;
and
,
while
I
was
gone
up
to
dress
,
he
had
presented
my
father
with
twenty
guineas
;
desiring
him
to
buy
himself
and
my
mother
such
apparel
as
they
should
think
proper
;
and
lay
it
all
out
:
but
I
knew
not
this
till
after
we
came
home
;
my
father
having
had
no
opportunity
to
tell
me
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
pleased
to
inform
me
of
the
chapel
being
got
in
tolerable
order
;
and
said
,
it
looked
very
well
;
and
against
he
came
down
next
,
it
should
be
all
new
white
-
washed
,
and
painted
and
lined
;
and
a
new
pulpit
-
cloth
,
cushion
,
desk
,
etc
.
<EOS>
and
that
it
should
always
be
kept
in
order
for
the
future
.
 
<EOS>
He
told
me
the
two
Misses
Darnford
,
and
Lady
Jones
,
would
dine
with
him
on
Sunday
:
And
,
with
their
servants
and
mine
,
said
he
,
we
shall
make
a
tolerable
congregation
.
 
<EOS>
And
,
added
he
<EOS>
,
have
I
not
well
contrived
to
shew
you
that
the
chapel
is
really
a
little
house
of
God
,
and
has
been
consecrated
,
before
we
solemnize
our
nuptials
in
it
?
 
<EOS>
O
,
sir
,
replied
I
,
your
goodness
to
me
is
inexpressible
!
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Peters
,
said
he
,
offered
to
come
and
officiate
in
it
;
but
would
not
stay
to
dine
with
me
,
because
he
has
company
at
his
own
house
:
<EOS>
and
so
I
intend
that
divine
service
shall
be
performed
in
it
by
one
to
whom
I
shall
make
some
yearly
allowance
,
as
a
sort
of
chaplain
.
 
<EOS>
You
look
serious
,
Pamela
,
added
he
:
<EOS>
I
know
you
think
of
your
friend
Williams
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
sir
,
said
I
,
if
you
wo
n't
be
angry
,
I
did
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
man
!
 
<EOS>
I
am
sorry
I
have
been
the
cause
of
his
disobliging
you
.
  
<EOS>
When
we
came
to
the
meadow
,
where
the
gentry
have
their
walk
sometimes
,
the
coach
stopt
,
and
my
master
alighted
,
and
led
me
to
the
brook
-
side
,
and
it
is
a
very
pretty
summer
walk
.
 
<EOS>
He
asked
my
father
,
If
he
chose
to
walk
out
,
or
go
on
in
the
coach
to
the
farther
end
?
 
<EOS>
He
,
poor
man
,
chose
to
go
on
in
the
coach
,
for
fear
,
he
said
,
any
gentry
should
be
walking
there
;
and
he
told
me
,
he
was
most
of
the
way
upon
his
knees
in
the
coach
,
thanking
God
for
his
gracious
mercies
and
goodness
;
and
begging
a
blessing
upon
my
good
master
and
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
quite
astonished
,
when
we
came
into
the
shady
walk
,
to
see
Mr.
Williams
there
.
 
<EOS>
See
there
,
said
my
master
,
there
's
poor
Williams
,
taking
his
solitary
walk
again
,
with
his
book
.
 
<EOS>
And
,
it
seems
,
it
was
so
contrived
;
for
Mr.
Peters
had
been
,
as
I
since
find
,
desired
to
tell
him
to
be
in
that
walk
at
such
an
hour
in
the
morning
.
  
<EOS>
So
,
old
acquaintance
,
said
my
master
,
again
have
I
met
you
in
this
place
?
<EOS>
What
book
are
you
now
reading
?
 
<EOS>
He
said
,
it
was
Boileau
's
Lutrin
.
 
<EOS>
Said
my
master
<EOS>
,
You
see
I
have
brought
with
me
my
little
fugitive
,
that
would
have
been
:
While
you
are
perfecting
yourself
in
French
,
I
am
trying
to
learn
English
;
and
hope
soon
to
be
master
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
Mine
,
sir
,
said
he
,
is
a
very
beautiful
piece
of
French
:
but
your
English
has
no
equal
.
  
<EOS>
You
are
very
polite
,
Mr.
Williams
,
said
my
master
:
<EOS>
And
he
that
does
not
think
as
you
do
,
deserves
no
share
in
her
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
Pamela
,
added
he
,
very
generously
,
why
so
strange
,
where
you
have
once
been
so
familiar
?
 
<EOS>
I
do
assure
you
both
,
<EOS>
that
I
mean
not
,
by
this
interview
,
to
insult
Mr.
Williams
,
or
confound
you
.
 
<EOS>
Then
I
said
,
Mr.
Williams
,
I
am
very
glad
to
see
you
well
;
and
though
the
generous
favour
of
my
good
master
has
happily
changed
the
scene
,
since
you
and
I
last
saw
one
another
,
I
am
nevertheless
very
glad
of
an
opportunity
to
acknowledge
,
with
gratitude
,
your
good
intentions
,
not
so
much
to
serve
me
,
as
me
,
but
as
a
person
 
that
then
had
great
reason
to
believe
herself
in
distress
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
hope
,
sir
,
added
I
,
to
my
master
,
your
goodness
will
permit
me
to
say
this
.
  
<EOS>
You
,
Pamela
,
said
he
,
may
make
what
acknowledgments
you
please
to
Mr.
Williams
's
good
intentions
;
and
I
would
have
you
speak
as
you
think
;
but
I
do
not
apprehend
myself
to
be
quite
so
much
obliged
to
those
intentions
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
,
said
Mr.
Williams
,
I
beg
leave
to
say
<EOS>
,
I
knew
well
,
that
,
by
education
,
you
was
no
libertine
;
nor
had
I
reason
to
think
you
so
by
inclination
;
and
,
when
you
came
to
reflect
,
I
hoped
you
would
not
be
displeased
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
And
this
was
no
small
motive
to
me
,
at
first
,
to
do
as
I
did
.
  
<EOS>
Ay
,
but
Mr.
Williams
,
said
my
master
,
could
you
think
I
should
have
had
reason
to
thank
you
,
if
,
loving
one
person
above
all
her
sex
,
you
had
robbed
me
of
her
,
and
married
her
yourself
?
 
<EOS>
And
then
,
said
he
,
<EOS>
you
are
to
consider
,
that
she
was
an
old
acquaintance
of
mine
,
and
a
quite
new
one
to
you
;
that
I
had
sent
her
down
to
my
own
house
,
for
better
securing
her
;
and
that
you
,
who
had
access
to
my
house
,
could
not
effect
your
purpose
,
without
being
guilty
,
in
some
sort
,
of
a
breach
of
the
laws
of
hospitality
and
friendship
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
my
designs
upon
her
,
I
own
they
had
not
the
best
appearance
;
but
still
I
was
not
answerable
to
Mr.
Williams
for
those
;
much
less
could
you
be
excused
to
invade
a
property
so
very
dear
to
me
,
and
to
endeavour
to
gain
an
interest
in
her
affections
,
when
you
could
not
be
certain
that
matters
would
not
turn
out
as
they
have
actually
done
.
  
<EOS>
I
own
,
said
he
,
that
some
parts
of
my
conduct
seem
exceptionable
,
as
you
state
it
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
sir
,
I
am
but
a
young
man
.
 
<EOS>
I
meant
no
harm
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
no
interest
<EOS>
,
I
am
sure
,
to
incur
your
displeasure
;
and
when
you
think
of
every
thing
,
and
the
inimitable
graces
of
person
,
and
perfections
of
mind
,
that
adorn
this
excellent
lady
,
(
so
he
called
me
,
)
<EOS>
you
will
,
perhaps
,
find
your
generosity
allow
something
as
an
extenuation
of
a
fault
,
which
your
anger
would
not
permit
as
an
excuse
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
done
,
said
my
master
;
nor
did
I
meet
you
here
to
be
angry
with
you
.
 
<EOS>
Pamela
knew
not
that
she
should
see
you
:
<EOS>
and
now
you
are
both
present
,
I
would
ask
you
,
Mr.
Williams
,
<EOS>
If
,
now
you
know
my
honourable
designs
towards
this
good
girl
,
you
can
really
be
almost
,
I
will
not
say
quite
,
as
well
pleased
with
the
friendship
of
my
wife
,
as
you
could
be
with
the
favour
of
Mrs.
Andrews
?
  
<EOS>
Sir
,
said
he
,
I
will
answer
you
truly
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
could
have
preferred
,
with
her
,
any
condition
that
could
have
befallen
me
,
had
I
considered
only
myself
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
sir
,
I
was
very
far
from
having
any
encouragement
to
expect
her
favour
;
and
I
had
much
more
reason
to
believe
,
that
,
if
she
could
have
hoped
for
your
goodness
,
her
heart
would
have
been
too
much
pre
-
engaged
to
think
of
any
body
else
.
 
<EOS>
And
give
me
leave
further
to
say
,
sir
,
that
,
though
I
tell
you
sincerely
my
thoughts
,
were
I
only
to
consider
myself
;
<EOS>
yet
,
when
I
consider
her
good
,
and
her
merit
,
I
should
be
highly
ungenerous
,
were
it
put
to
my
choice
,
if
I
could
not
wish
her
in
a
condition
so
much
superior
to
what
I
could
raise
her
to
,
and
so
very
answerable
to
her
merit
.
  
<EOS>
Pamela
,
said
my
master
,
you
are
obliged
to
Mr.
Williams
,
and
ought
to
thank
him
:
He
has
distinguished
well
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
as
for
me
,
who
had
like
to
have
lost
you
by
his
means
,
I
am
glad
the
matter
was
not
left
to
his
choice
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Williams
,
added
he
,
I
give
you
Pamela
's
hand
,
because
I
know
it
will
be
pleasing
to
her
,
in
token
of
her
friendship
and
esteem
for
you
;
and
I
give
you
mine
,
that
I
will
not
be
your
enemy
:
<EOS>
but
yet
I
must
say
,
that
I
think
I
owe
this
proper
manner
of
your
thinking
more
to
your
disappointment
,
than
to
the
generosity
you
talk
of
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Williams
kissed
my
hand
,
as
my
master
gave
it
him
;
and
my
master
said
,
Sir
,
you
will
go
home
and
dine
with
me
,
and
I
'll
shew
you
my
little
chapel
;
and
do
you
,
Pamela
,
look
upon
yourself
at
liberty
to
number
Mr.
Williams
in
the
list
of
your
friends
.
  
<EOS>
How
generous
,
how
noble
,
was
this
!
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Williams
<EOS>
(
and
so
had
I
)
had
tears
of
pleasure
in
his
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
silent
:
<EOS>
But
Mr.
Williams
said
,
Sir
,
I
shall
be
taught
,
by
your
generosity
,
to
think
myself
inexcusably
wrong
,
in
every
step
I
took
,
that
could
give
you
offence
;
and
my
future
life
shall
shew
my
respectful
gratitude
.
  
<EOS>
We
walked
on
till
we
came
to
the
coach
,
where
was
my
dear
father
.
<EOS>
Pamela
,
said
my
master
,
tell
Mr.
Williams
who
that
good
man
is
.
 
<EOS>
O
,
Mr.
Williams
!
<EOS>
said
I
,
it
is
my
dear
father
!
<EOS>
and
my
master
was
pleased
to
say
,
One
of
the
honestest
men
in
England
:
Pamela
owes
every
thing
that
she
is
to
be
,
as
well
as
her
being
,
to
him
;
for
,
I
think
,
she
would
not
have
brought
me
to
this
,
nor
made
so
great
resistance
,
but
for
the
good
lessons
,
and
religious
education
,
she
had
imbibed
from
him
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Williams
said
,
taking
father
's
hand
,
You
see
,
good
Mr.
Andrews
,
with
inexpressible
pleasure
,
no
doubt
,
the
fruits
of
your
pious
care
;
and
now
are
in
a
way
,
with
your
beloved
daughter
,
to
reap
the
happy
effects
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
overcome
,
said
my
dear
father
,
with
his
honour
's
goodness
:
<EOS>
But
I
can
only
say
,
I
bless
God
,
and
bless
him
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Williams
and
I
being
nearer
the
coach
than
my
master
,
and
he
offering
to
draw
back
,
to
give
way
to
him
<EOS>
,
he
kindly
said
,
Pray
,
<EOS>
Mr.
Williams
,
oblige
Pamela
with
your
hand
;
and
step
in
yourself
.
 
<EOS>
He
bowed
,
and
took
my
hand
;
and
my
master
made
him
step
in
,
and
sit
next
me
,
all
that
ever
he
could
do
;
and
sat
himself
over
against
him
,
next
my
father
,
who
sat
against
me
.
  
<EOS>
And
he
said
,
Mr.
Andrews
,
I
told
you
yesterday
that
the
divine
you
saw
was
not
Mr.
Williams
;
I
now
tell
you
,
this
gentleman
is
:
<EOS>
and
though
I
have
been
telling
him
,
I
think
not
myself
obliged
to
his
intentions
;
yet
I
will
own
that
Pamela
and
you
are
;
and
though
I
wo
n't
promise
to
love
him
,
I
would
have
you
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
,
said
Mr.
Williams
,
you
have
a
way
of
overcoming
,
that
hardly
all
my
reading
affords
an
instance
of
;
and
it
is
the
more
noble
,
as
it
is
on
this
side
,
as
I
presume
,
the
happy
ceremony
,
which
,
great
as
your
fortune
is
,
will
lay
you
under
an
obligation
to
so
much
virtue
and
beauty
,
when
the
lady
becomes
yours
;
for
you
will
then
have
a
treasure
that
princes
might
envy
you
.
  
<EOS>
Said
my
generous
master
,
(
God
bless
him
!
)
<EOS>
Mr.
Williams
,
it
is
impossible
that
you
and
I
should
long
live
at
variance
,
when
our
sentiments
agree
so
well
together
,
on
subjects
the
most
material
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
quite
confounded
;
and
my
master
,
seeing
it
,
took
my
hand
,
and
said
,
Look
up
,
my
good
girl
;
and
collect
yourself
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
injure
Mr.
Williams
and
me
so
much
,
as
to
think
we
are
capping
compliments
,
as
we
used
to
do
verses
at
school
.
 
<EOS>
I
dare
answer
for
us
both
,
that
we
say
not
a
syllable
we
do
n't
think
.
  
<EOS>
O
sir
,
said
I
,
how
unequal
am
I
to
all
this
goodness
!
 
<EOS>
Every
moment
that
passes
adds
to
the
weight
of
the
obligations
you
oppress
me
with
.
  
<EOS>
Think
not
too
much
of
that
,
said
he
most
generously
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Williams
's
compliments
to
you
have
great
advantage
of
mine
:
<EOS>
For
,
though
equally
sincere
,
I
have
a
great
deal
to
say
,
and
to
do
,
to
compensate
the
sufferings
I
have
made
you
undergo
;
and
,
at
last
,
must
sit
down
dissatisfied
,
because
those
will
never
be
balanced
by
all
I
can
do
for
you
.
  
<EOS>
He
saw
my
dear
father
quite
unable
to
support
these
affecting
instances
of
his
goodness
;
 
and
he
let
go
my
hand
,
and
took
his
;
and
said
,
seeing
his
tears
,
I
wonder
not
,
my
dear
Pamela
's
father
,
that
your
honest
heart
springs
thus
to
your
eyes
,
to
see
all
her
trials
at
an
end
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
not
pretend
to
say
,
that
I
had
formerly
either
power
or
will
to
act
thus
:
<EOS>
But
since
I
began
to
resolve
on
the
change
you
see
,
I
have
reaped
so
much
pleasure
in
it
,
that
my
own
interest
will
keep
me
steady
:
<EOS>
For
,
till
within
these
few
days
,
I
knew
not
what
it
was
to
be
happy
.
  
<EOS>
Poor
Mr.
Williams
,
with
tears
of
joy
in
his
eyes
,
said
,
How
happily
,
sir
,
have
you
been
touched
by
the
divine
grace
,
before
you
have
been
hurried
into
the
commission
of
sins
,
that
the
deepest
penitence
could
hardly
have
atoned
for
!
 
<EOS>
God
has
enabled
you
to
stop
short
of
the
evil
;
and
you
have
nothing
to
do
,
but
to
rejoice
in
the
good
,
which
now
will
be
doubly
so
,
because
you
can
receive
it
without
the
least
inward
reproach
.
  
<EOS>
You
do
well
,
said
he
,
to
remind
me
,
that
I
owe
all
this
to
the
grace
of
God
.
 
<EOS>
I
bless
Him
for
it
;
and
I
thank
this
good
man
for
his
excellent
lessons
to
his
daughter
<EOS>
;
I
thank
her
for
following
them
:
and
I
hope
,
from
her
good
example
,
and
your
friendship
,
Mr.
Williams
,
in
time
,
to
be
half
as
good
as
my
tutoress
:
and
that
,
said
he
,
I
believe
you
'll
own
,
will
make
me
,
without
disparagement
to
any
man
,
the
best
fox
-
hunter
in
England
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Williams
was
going
to
speak
:
and
<EOS>
he
said
,
You
put
on
so
grave
a
look
,
Mr.
Williams
,
that
,
I
believe
,
what
I
have
said
,
with
you
practical
good
folks
,
is
liable
to
exception
:
but
I
see
we
are
become
quite
grave
;
and
we
must
not
be
too
serious
neither
.
  
<EOS>
What
a
happy
creature
,
my
dear
mother
,
is
your
Pamela
!
 
<EOS>
O
may
my
thankful
heart
,
and
the
good
use
I
may
be
enabled
to
make
of
the
blessings
before
me
,
be
a
means
to
continue
this
delightful
prospect
to
a
long
date
,
for
the
sake
of
the
dear
good
gentleman
,
who
thus
becomes
the
happy
instrument
,
in
the
hand
of
Providence
,
to
bless
all
he
smiles
upon
!
 
<EOS>
To
be
sure
,
I
shall
never
enough
acknowledge
the
value
he
is
pleased
to
express
for
my
unworthiness
,
in
that
he
has
prevented
my
wishes
,
and
,
unasked
,
sought
the
occasion
of
being
reconciled
to
a
good
man
,
who
,
for
my
sake
,
had
incurred
his
displeasure
;
and
whose
name
he
could
not
,
a
few
days
before
,
permit
to
pass
through
my
lips
!
 
<EOS>
But
see
the
wonderful
ways
of
Providence
!
 
<EOS>
The
very
things
that
I
most
dreaded
his
seeing
or
knowing
,
the
contents
of
my
papers
,
have
,
as
I
hope
,
satisfied
all
his
scruples
,
and
been
a
means
to
promote
my
happiness
.
  
<EOS>
Henceforth
let
not
us
poor
short
-
sighted
mortals
pretend
to
rely
on
our
own
wisdom
;
or
vainly
think
,
that
we
are
absolutely
to
direct
for
ourselves
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
abundant
reason
,
I
am
sure
,
to
say
,
that
,
when
I
was
most
disappointed
,
I
was
nearer
my
happiness
:
<EOS>
for
had
I
made
my
escape
,
which
was
so
often
my
chief
point
in
view
,
and
what
I
had
placed
my
heart
upon
,
I
had
escaped
the
blessings
now
before
me
,
and
fallen
,
perhaps
headlong
,
into
the
miseries
I
would
have
avoided
.
 
<EOS>
And
yet
,
after
all
,
it
was
necessary
I
should
take
the
steps
I
did
,
to
bring
on
this
wonderful
turn
:
O
the
unsearchable
wisdom
of
God
!
 
<EOS>
And
how
much
ought
I
to
adore
the
divine
goodness
,
and
humble
myself
,
who
am
made
a
poor
instrument
,
as
I
hope
,
not
only
to
magnify
his
graciousness
to
this
fine
gentleman
and
myself
,
but
also
to
dispense
benefits
to
others
!
 
<EOS>
Which
God
of
his
mercy
grant
!
  
<EOS>
In
the
agreeable
manner
I
have
mentioned
,
did
we
pass
the
time
in
our
second
happy
tour
;
and
I
thought
Mrs.
Jewkes
would
have
sunk
into
the
ground
,
when
she
saw
Mr.
Williams
brought
in
the
coach
with
us
,
and
treated
so
kindly
.
 
<EOS>
We
dined
together
in
a
most
pleasant
,
easy
,
and
frank
manner
;
and
I
found
I
need
not
,
from
my
master
's
generosity
,
to
be
under
any
restraint
,
as
to
my
conduct
to
this
good
clergyman
:
<EOS>
For
he
,
so
often
as
he
fancied
I
was
reserved
,
moved
me
to
be
free
with
him
,
and
to
him
;
and
several
times
called
upon
me
to
help
my
father
and
Mr.
Williams
;
and
seemed
to
take
great
delight
in
seeing
me
carve
,
as
,
indeed
,
he
does
in
every
thing
I
do
.
  
<EOS>
After
dinner
we
went
and
looked
into
the
chapel
,
which
is
a
very
pretty
one
,
and
very
decent
;
and
,
when
finished
as
he
designs
it
,
against
his
next
coming
down
,
will
be
a
very
pretty
place
.
  
<EOS>
My
heart
,
my
dear
mother
,
when
I
first
set
my
foot
in
it
,
throbbed
a
good
deal
,
with
awful
joy
,
at
the
thoughts
of
the
solemnity
,
which
,
I
hope
,
will
in
a
few
days
be
performed
here
.
 
<EOS>
And
when
I
came
up
towards
the
little
pretty
altar
-
piece
,
while
they
were
looking
at
a
communion
-
picture
,
and
saying
it
was
prettily
done
,
I
gently
stept
into
a
corner
,
out
of
sight
,
and
poured
out
my
soul
to
God
on
my
knees
,
in
supplication
and
thankfulness
,
that
,
after
having
been
so
long
absent
from
divine
service
,
the
first
time
I
entered
into
a
house
dedicated
to
his
honour
,
should
be
with
such
blessed
prospects
before
me
;
and
begging
of
God
to
continue
me
humble
,
and
to
make
me
not
unworthy
of
his
mercies
;
and
that
he
would
be
pleased
to
bless
the
next
author
of
my
happiness
,
my
good
master
.
  
<EOS>
I
heard
my
master
say
,
Where
's
Pamela
?
 
<EOS>
And
so
I
broke
off
sooner
than
I
would
,
and
went
up
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
He
said
,
Mr.
Williams
,
I
hope
I
have
not
so
offended
you
by
my
conduct
past
,
(
for
really
it
is
what
I
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
,
)
as
that
you
will
refuse
to
officiate
,
and
to
give
us
your
instructions
here
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Peters
was
so
kind
,
for
the
first
time
,
to
offer
it
;
but
I
knew
it
would
be
inconvenient
for
him
;
and
,
besides
,
I
was
willing
to
make
this
request
to
you
an
introduction
to
our
reconciliation
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
,
said
he
,
most
willingly
,
and
most
gratefully
,
will
I
obey
you
:
<EOS>
Though
,
if
you
expect
a
discourse
,
I
am
wholly
unprepared
for
the
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
not
have
it
,
replied
he
,
pointed
to
any
particular
occasion
;
but
if
you
have
one
upon
the
text
 
There
is
more
joy
in
Heaven
over
one
sinner
that
repenteth
,
than
over
ninety
-
nine
just
persons
that
need
no
repentance
;
and
if
it
makes
me
not
such
a
sad
fellow
as
to
be
pointed
at
by
mine
and
the
ladies
'
servants
we
shall
have
here
,
I
shall
be
well
content
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
a
general
subject
,
added
he
,
makes
me
speak
of
that
;
but
any
one
you
please
will
do
;
for
you
can
not
make
a
bad
choice
,
I
am
sure
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
,
said
he
,
I
have
one
upon
that
text
;
but
I
am
ready
to
think
,
that
a
thanksgiving
one
,
which
I
made
on
a
great
mercy
to
myself
,
if
I
may
be
permitted
to
make
my
own
acknowledgments
of
your
favour
the
subject
of
a
discourse
,
will
be
suitable
to
my
grateful
sentiments
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
on
the
text
;
 
Now
lettest
thou
thy
servant
depart
in
peace
;
for
mine
eyes
have
seen
thy
salvation
.
  
<EOS>
That
text
,
said
I
,
will
be
a
very
suitable
one
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
Not
so
,
Pamela
,
said
my
master
;
because
I
do
n't
let
you
depart
in
peace
;
but
I
hope
you
will
stay
here
with
content
.
  
<EOS>
O
<EOS>
but
,
sir
,
said
I
,
I
have
seen
God
's
salvation
!
 
<EOS>
I
am
sure
,
added
I
,
<EOS>
if
any
body
ever
had
reason
,
I
have
to
say
,
with
the
blessed
virgin
,
My
soul
doth
magnify
the
Lord
;
for
he
hath
regarded
the
low
estate
of
his
handmaiden
 
and
exalted
one
of
low
degree
.
  
<EOS>
Said
my
good
father
<EOS>
,
I
am
sure
,
if
there
were
time
for
it
,
the
book
of
Ruth
would
afford
a
fine
subject
for
the
honour
done
my
dear
child
.
  
<EOS>
Why
,
good
Mr.
Andrews
,
said
my
master
,
should
you
say
so
?
 
<EOS>
I
know
that
story
,
and
Mr.
Williams
will
confirm
what
I
say
,
that
my
good
girl
here
will
confer
at
least
as
much
honour
as
she
will
receive
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
,
said
I
,
you
are
inexpressibly
generous
;
but
I
shall
never
think
so
.
<EOS>
Why
,
my
Pamela
,
said
he
,
that
's
another
thing
:
It
will
be
best
for
me
to
think
you
will
;
and
it
will
be
kind
in
you
to
think
you
sha
n't
;
and
then
we
shall
always
have
an
excellent
rule
to
regulate
our
conduct
by
to
one
another
.
  
<EOS>
Was
not
this
finely
,
nobly
,
wisely
said
,
my
dear
mother
?
 
<EOS>
O
what
a
blessed
thing
it
is
to
be
matched
to
a
man
of
sense
and
generosity
!
 
<EOS>
How
edifying
!
 
<EOS>
How
!
 
<EOS>
But
what
shall
I
say
?
 
<EOS>
I
am
at
loss
for
words
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Williams
said
,
when
we
came
out
of
the
little
chapel
,
He
would
go
home
,
and
look
over
his
discourses
,
for
one
for
the
next
day
.
 
<EOS>
My
master
said
,
I
have
one
thing
to
say
before
you
go
 
<EOS>
When
my
jealousy
,
on
account
of
this
good
girl
,
put
me
upon
such
a
vindictive
conduct
to
you
,
you
know
I
took
a
bond
for
the
money
I
had
caused
you
to
be
troubled
for
:
<EOS>
I
really
am
ashamed
of
the
matter
;
because
I
never
intended
,
when
I
presented
it
to
you
,
to
have
it
again
,
you
may
be
sure
:
<EOS>
But
I
knew
not
what
might
happen
between
you
and
her
,
nor
how
far
matters
might
have
gone
between
you
;
and
so
I
was
willing
to
have
that
in
awe
over
you
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
think
it
is
no
extraordinary
present
,
therefore
,
to
give
you
up
your
bond
again
cancelled
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
he
took
it
from
his
pocket
,
and
gave
it
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
,
added
he
,
all
the
charges
attending
it
,
and
the
trouble
you
had
,
were
defrayed
by
my
attorney
<EOS>
;
I
ordered
that
they
should
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
,
sir
,
said
he
;
and
ten
thousand
thanks
to
you
for
this
goodness
,
and
the
kind
manner
in
which
you
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
will
go
,
Mr.
Williams
,
said
he
,
shall
my
chariot
carry
you
home
?
 
<EOS>
No
,
sir
,
answered
he
,
I
thank
you
.
 
<EOS>
My
time
will
be
so
well
employed
all
the
way
,
in
thinking
of
your
favours
,
that
I
choose
to
meditate
upon
them
,
as
I
walk
home
.
  
<EOS>
My
dear
father
was
a
little
uneasy
about
his
habit
,
for
appearing
at
chapel
next
day
,
because
of
Misses
Darnford
and
the
servants
,
for
fear
,
poor
man
<EOS>
,
he
should
disgrace
my
master
;
and
he
told
me
,
when
he
was
mentioning
this
,
of
my
master
's
kind
present
of
twenty
guineas
for
clothes
,
for
you
both
;
which
made
my
heart
truly
joyful
.
 
<EOS>
But
oh
!
to
be
sure
,
I
can
never
deserve
the
hundredth
part
of
his
goodness
!
 
<EOS>
It
is
almost
a
hard
thing
to
be
under
the
weight
of
such
deep
obligations
on
one
side
,
and
such
a
sense
of
one
's
own
unworthiness
on
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
O
!
<EOS>
what
a
Godlike
power
is
that
of
doing
good
!
 
<EOS>
I
envy
the
rich
and
the
great
for
nothing
else
.
  
<EOS>
My
master
coming
to
us
just
then
,
I
said
,
Oh
!
<EOS>
sir
,
will
your
bounty
know
no
limits
?
 
<EOS>
My
dear
father
has
told
me
what
you
have
given
him
.
 
<EOS>
A
trifle
,
Pamela
,
said
he
,
a
little
earnest
only
of
my
kindness
.
 
<EOS>
Say
no
more
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
But
did
I
not
hear
the
good
man
expressing
some
sort
of
concern
for
somewhat
?
 
<EOS>
Hide
nothing
from
me
,
Pamela
.
 
<EOS>
Only
,
sir
,
said
I
,
he
knew
not
how
to
absent
himself
from
divine
service
,
and
yet
is
afraid
of
disgracing
you
by
appearing
.
  
<EOS>
Fie
,
Mr.
Andrews
!
<EOS>
said
he
,
<EOS>
I
thought
you
knew
that
the
outward
appearance
was
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
I
had
as
good
a
habit
inwardly
as
you
have
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
'll
tell
you
,
Pamela
,
your
father
is
not
so
much
thinner
than
I
am
,
nor
much
shorter
;
he
and
I
will
walk
up
together
to
my
wardrobe
;
though
it
is
not
so
well
stored
here
,
as
in
Bedfordshire
.
  
<EOS>
And
so
,
said
he
,
pleasantly
,
do
n't
you
pretend
to
come
near
us
,
till
I
call
for
you
;
for
you
must
not
yet
see
how
men
dress
and
undress
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
O
sir
,
said
my
father
,
I
beg
to
be
excused
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
sorry
you
were
told
.
 
<EOS>
So
am
not
I
,
said
my
master
:
<EOS>
Pray
come
along
with
me
.
  
<EOS>
He
carried
him
up
stairs
,
and
shewed
him
several
suits
,
and
would
have
had
him
take
his
choice
.
 
<EOS>
My
poor
father
was
quite
confounded
:
for
my
master
saw
not
any
he
thought
too
good
,
and
my
father
none
that
he
thought
bad
enough
.
 
<EOS>
And
my
good
master
,
at
last
,
(
he
fixed
his
eye
upon
a
fine
drab
,
which
he
thought
looked
the
plainest
,
)
<EOS>
would
help
him
to
try
the
coat
and
waistcoat
on
himself
;
and
,
indeed
,
one
would
not
have
thought
it
,
because
my
master
is
taller
,
and
rather
plumper
,
as
I
thought
<EOS>
but
,
as
I
saw
afterwards
,
they
fitted
him
very
well
.
 
<EOS>
And
being
plain
,
and
lined
with
the
same
colour
,
and
made
for
travelling
in
a
coach
,
pleased
my
poor
father
much
.
 
<EOS>
He
gave
him
the
whole
suit
,
and
,
calling
up
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
said
,
Let
these
clothes
be
well
aired
against
tomorrow
morning
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Andrews
brought
only
with
him
his
common
apparel
,
not
thinking
to
stay
Sunday
with
us
.
 
<EOS>
And
pray
see
for
some
of
my
stockings
,
and
whether
any
of
my
shoes
will
fit
him
:
And
see
also
for
some
of
my
linen
;
for
we
have
put
the
good
man
quite
out
of
his
course
,
by
keeping
him
Sunday
over
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
then
pleased
to
give
him
the
silver
buckles
out
of
his
own
shoes
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
my
good
mother
,
you
must
expect
to
see
my
dear
father
a
great
beau
.
 
<EOS>
Wig
,
said
my
master
,
he
wants
none
;
for
his
own
venerable
white
locks
are
better
than
all
the
perukes
in
England
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
am
sure
I
have
hats
enough
somewhere
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
take
care
of
every
thing
,
sir
,
said
Mrs.
Jewkes
.
 
<EOS>
And
my
poor
father
,
when
he
came
to
me
,
could
not
refrain
tears
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
not
how
,
said
he
,
to
comport
myself
under
these
great
favours
.
 
<EOS>
O
my
child
,
it
is
all
owing
to
the
divine
goodness
,
and
your
virtue
.
  
<EOS>
Sunday
.
  
<EOS>
This
blessed
day
all
the
family
seemed
to
take
delight
to
equip
themselves
for
the
celebration
of
the
Sabbath
in
the
little
chapel
;
and
Lady
Jones
and
Mr.
Williams
came
in
her
chariot
,
and
the
two
Misses
Darnford
in
their
own
.
 
<EOS>
And
we
breakfasted
together
in
a
most
agreeable
manner
.
 
<EOS>
My
dear
father
appeared
quite
spruce
and
neat
,
and
was
quite
caressed
by
the
three
ladies
.
 
<EOS>
As
we
were
at
breakfast
,
my
master
told
Mr.
Williams
,
We
must
let
the
Psalms
alone
,
he
doubted
,
for
want
of
a
clerk
:
but
Mr.
Williams
said
,
No
,
nothing
should
be
wanting
that
he
could
supply
.
 
<EOS>
My
father
said
,
If
it
might
be
permitted
him
,
he
would
,
as
well
as
he
was
able
,
perform
that
office
;
for
it
was
always
what
he
had
taken
delight
in
.
 
<EOS>
And
as
I
knew
he
had
learnt
psalmody
formerly
,
in
his
youth
,
and
had
constantly
practised
it
in
private
,
at
home
,
on
Sunday
evenings
,
(
as
well
as
endeavoured
to
teach
it
in
the
little
school
he
so
unsuccessfully
set
up
,
at
the
beginning
of
his
misfortunes
,
before
he
took
to
hard
labour
,
)
<EOS>
I
was
in
no
pain
for
his
undertaking
it
in
this
little
congregation
.
 
<EOS>
They
seemed
much
pleased
with
this
;
and
so
we
went
to
chapel
,
and
made
a
pretty
tolerable
appearance
;
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
and
all
the
servants
,
attending
,
but
the
cook
:
<EOS>
And
I
never
saw
divine
service
performed
with
more
solemnity
,
nor
assisted
at
with
greater
devotion
and
decency
;
my
master
,
Lady
Jones
,
and
the
two
misses
,
setting
a
lovely
example
.
  
<EOS>
My
good
father
performed
his
part
with
great
applause
,
making
the
responses
,
as
if
he
had
been
a
practised
parish
-
clerk
;
and
giving
the
xxiiid
psalm
,
      
<EOS>
[
The
Lord
is
only
my
support
,
       
And
he
that
doth
me
feed
:
     
<EOS>
How
can
I
then
lack
any
thing
       
<EOS>
Whereof
<EOS>
I
stand
in
need
?
     
<EOS>
In
pastures
green
he
feedeth
me
,
       
Where
I
do
safely
lie
;
     
And
after
leads
me
to
the
streams
,
       
<EOS>
Which
run
most
pleasantly
.
       
<EOS>
And
when
I
find
myself
near
lost
,
       
Then
home
he
doth
me
take
;
     
<EOS>
Conducting
me
in
his
right
paths
,
       
E'en
for
his
own
name
's
sake
.
     
<EOS>
And
tho
<EOS>
'
I
were
e'en
at
death
's
door
,
       
<EOS>
Yet
would
I
fear
no
ill
:
     
<EOS>
For
both
thy
rod
and
shepherd
's
crook
       
Afford
me
comfort
still
.
       
<EOS>
Thou
hast
my
table
richly
spread
       
<EOS>
In
presence
of
my
foe
:
     
<EOS>
Thou
hast
my
head
with
balm
refresh'd
,
       
<EOS>
My
cup
doth
overflow
.
     
<EOS>
And
finally
,
while
breath
doth
last
,
       
Thy
grace
shall
me
defend
:
     
<EOS>
And
in
the
house
of
God
will
I
       
<EOS>
My
life
for
ever
spend
.
]
  
<EOS>
which
consisted
of
but
three
staves
,
we
had
it
all
;
and
he
read
the
line
,
and
began
the
tune
with
a
heart
so
entirely
affected
with
the
duty
,
that
he
went
through
it
distinctly
,
calmly
,
and
fervently
at
the
same
time
;
so
that
Lady
Jones
whispered
me
,
That
good
man
were
fit
for
all
companies
,
and
present
to
every
laudable
occasion
:
<EOS>
And
Miss
Darnford
said
,
God
bless
the
dear
good
man
!
 
<EOS>
You
must
think
how
I
rejoiced
in
my
mind
.
  
<EOS>
I
know
,
my
dear
mother
,
you
can
say
most
of
the
shortest
psalms
by
heart
;
so
I
need
not
transcribe
it
,
especially
as
your
chief
treasure
is
a
bible
;
and
a
worthy
treasure
it
is
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
nobody
makes
more
or
better
use
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Williams
gave
us
an
excellent
discourse
on
liberality
and
generosity
,
and
the
blessings
attending
the
right
use
of
riches
,
from
the
xith
chapter
of
Proverbs
,
ver
.
24
,
25
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
that
scattereth
,
and
yet
increaseth
;
and
there
is
that
withholdeth
more
than
is
meet
,
but
it
tendeth
to
poverty
.
 
<EOS>
The
liberal
soul
shall
be
made
fat
:
And
he
that
watereth
,
shall
be
watered
also
himself
.
 
<EOS>
And
he
treated
the
subject
in
so
handsome
a
manner
,
that
my
master
's
delicacy
,
who
,
at
first
,
was
afraid
of
some
personal
compliments
,
was
not
offended
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Williams
judiciously
keeping
to
generals
;
and
it
was
an
elegant
and
sensible
discourse
,
as
my
master
said
.
  
<EOS>
My
father
was
in
the
clerk
's
place
,
just
under
the
desk
;
and
Lady
Jones
,
by
her
footman
,
whispered
him
to
favour
us
with
another
psalm
,
when
the
sermon
was
ended
.
 
<EOS>
He
thinking
,
as
he
said
afterwards
,
that
the
former
was
rather
of
the
longest
,
chose
the
shortest
in
the
book
,
which
you
know
is
the
cxviith
.
      
<EOS>
[
O
all
ye
nations
of
the
world
,
       
Praise
ye
the
Lord
always
:
     
<EOS>
And
all
ye
people
every
where
       
Set
forth
his
noble
praise
.
       
<EOS>
For
great
his
kindness
is
to
us
;
       
<EOS>
His
truth
doth
not
decay
:
     
<EOS>
Wherefore
praise
ye
the
Lord
our
God
;
       
Praise
ye
the
Lord
alway
.
]
  
<EOS>
My
master
thanked
Mr.
Williams
for
his
excellent
discourse
,
and
so
did
the
ladies
;
as
also
did
I
most
heartily
:
and
he
was
pleased
to
take
my
dear
father
by
the
hand
,
as
did
also
Mr.
Williams
,
and
thanked
him
.
 
<EOS>
The
ladies
,
likewise
,
made
him
their
compliments
;
and
the
servants
all
looked
upon
him
with
countenances
of
respect
and
pleasure
.
  
<EOS>
At
dinner
,
do
what
I
could
,
I
was
forced
to
take
the
upper
end
of
the
table
;
and
my
master
sat
at
the
lower
end
,
between
Mr.
Williams
and
my
father
.
 
<EOS>
And
he
said
,
Pamela
,
you
are
so
dexterous
,
that
I
think
you
may
help
the
ladies
yourself
;
and
I
will
help
my
two
good
friends
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
have
told
you
,
though
,
that
I
dressed
myself
in
a
flowered
satin
<EOS>
,
that
was
my
lady
's
,
and
looked
quite
fresh
and
good
,
and
which
was
given
me
,
at
first
,
by
my
master
;
and
the
ladies
,
who
had
not
seen
me
out
of
my
homespun
before
,
made
me
abundance
of
fine
compliments
,
as
soon
as
they
saw
me
first
.
  
<EOS>
Talking
of
the
Psalms
just
after
dinner
,
my
master
was
very
naughty
,
if
I
may
so
say
:
For
he
said
to
my
father
,
Mr.
Andrews
<EOS>
,
I
think
in
the
afternoon
,
as
we
shall
have
only
prayers
,
we
may
have
one
longer
psalm
;
and
what
think
you
of
the
cxxxviith
?
 
<EOS>
O
,
good
sir
!
<EOS>
said
I
,
pray
,
pray
,
not
a
word
more
!
 
<EOS>
Say
what
you
will
,
Pamela
,
said
he
,
you
shall
sing
it
to
us
,
according
to
your
on
version
,
before
these
good
ladies
go
away
.
<EOS>
My
father
smiled
,
but
was
half
concerned
for
me
;
and
said
,
Will
it
bear
,
and
please
your
honour
?
 
<EOS>
O
ay
,
said
he
,
never
fear
it
;
so
long
as
Mrs.
Jewkes
is
not
in
the
hearing
.
  
<EOS>
This
excited
all
the
ladies
'
curiosity
;
and
Lady
Jones
said
,
She
would
be
loath
to
desire
to
hear
any
thing
that
would
give
me
concern
;
but
should
be
glad
I
would
give
leave
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
madam
,
said
I
,
I
must
beg
you
wo
n't
insist
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
bear
it
.
 
<EOS>
You
shall
see
it
,
indeed
,
ladies
,
said
my
master
;
and
pray
,
Pamela
,
not
always
as
you
please
,
neither
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
pray
sir
,
said
I
,
not
in
my
hearing
,
I
hope
.
 
<EOS>
Sure
,
Pamela
,
returned
he
<EOS>
,
you
would
not
write
what
is
not
fit
to
be
heard
!
  
<EOS>
But
,
sir
,
said
I
,
there
are
particular
cases
,
times
,
and
occasions
<EOS>
,
that
may
make
a
thing
passable
at
one
time
,
that
would
not
be
tolerable
at
another
.
 
<EOS>
O
,
said
he
,
let
me
judge
of
that
,
as
well
as
you
,
Pamela
.
<EOS>
These
ladies
know
a
good
part
of
your
story
;
and
,
let
me
tell
you
,
what
they
know
is
more
to
your
credit
than
mine
;
so
that
if
I
have
no
averseness
to
reviving
the
occasion
,
you
may
very
well
bear
it
.
 
<EOS>
Said
he
,
I
will
put
you
out
of
your
pain
,
Pamela
:
<EOS>
here
it
is
:
and
took
it
out
of
his
pocket
.
  
<EOS>
I
stood
up
,
and
said
,
Indeed
,
sir
,
I
ca
n't
bear
it
;
I
hope
you
'll
allow
me
to
leave
the
room
a
minute
,
if
you
will
read
it
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
<EOS>
but
I
wo
n't
,
answered
he
.
 
<EOS>
Lady
Jones
said
,
Pray
,
good
sir
,
do
n't
let
us
hear
it
,
if
Mrs.
Andrews
be
so
unwilling
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
Pamela
,
said
my
master
,
I
will
put
it
to
your
choice
,
whether
I
shall
read
it
now
,
or
you
will
sing
it
by
and
by
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
very
hard
,
sir
,
said
I.
 
It
must
be
one
<EOS>
,
I
assure
you
,
said
he
.
 
<EOS>
Why
then
,
sir
,
replied
I
,
you
must
do
as
you
please
;
for
I
can
not
sing
it
.
  
<EOS>
Well
,
then
,
said
my
master
,
I
find
I
must
read
it
;
and
yet
,
added
he
,
<EOS>
after
all
,
I
had
as
well
let
it
alone
,
for
it
is
no
great
reputation
to
myself
.
 
<EOS>
O
then
,
said
Miss
Darnford
,
pray
let
us
hear
it
,
to
choose
.
  
<EOS>
Why
then
,
proceeded
he
,
the
case
was
this
:
<EOS>
Pamela
,
I
find
,
when
she
was
in
the
time
of
her
confinement
,
(
that
is
,
added
he
,
when
she
was
taken
prisoner
,
in
order
to
make
me
one
;
for
that
is
the
upshot
of
the
matter
,
)
<EOS>
in
the
journal
she
kept
,
which
was
intended
for
nobody
's
perusal
but
her
parents
,
tells
them
,
that
she
was
importuned
,
one
Sunday
,
by
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
to
sing
a
psalm
;
but
her
spirits
not
permitting
,
she
declined
it
:
But
after
Mrs.
Jewkes
was
gone
down
,
she
says
,
she
recollected
,
that
the
cxxxviith
psalm
was
applicable
to
her
own
case
;
Mrs.
Jewkes
having
often
,
on
other
days
,
in
vain
,
besought
her
to
sing
a
song
:
<EOS>
That
thereupon
she
turned
it
more
to
her
own
supposed
case
;
and
believing
Mrs.
Jewkes
had
a
design
against
her
honour
,
and
looking
upon
her
as
her
gaoler
,
she
thus
gives
her
version
of
this
psalm
.
 
<EOS>
But
pray
,
Mr.
Williams
,
do
you
read
one
verse
of
the
common
translation
,
and
I
will
read
one
of
Pamela
's
.
 
<EOS>
Then
Mr.
Williams
,
pulling
out
his
little
pocket
Common
-
Prayer
-
Book
,
read
the
first
two
stanzas
:
                   
I.
      
<EOS>
When
we
did
sit
in
Babylon
,
      
<EOS>
The
rivers
round
about
;
    
Then
in
remembrance
of
Sion
,
      
<EOS>
The
tears
for
grief
burst
out
.
                  
<EOS>
II
.
      
<EOS>
We
<EOS>
hang'd
<EOS>
our
harps
and
instruments
      
<EOS>
The
willow
trees
upon
:
    
<EOS>
For
in
that
place
,
men
,
for
that
use
,
      
Had
planted
many
a
one
.
  
<EOS>
My
master
then
read
:
                   
I.
      
<EOS>
When
sad
I
sat
in
B####n
-
hall
,
      
All
guarded
round
about
,
    
And
thought
of
ev'ry
absent
friend
,
      
The
tears
for
grief
burst
out
.
                  
<EOS>
II
.
      
<EOS>
My
joys
and
hopes
all
overthrown
,
      
<EOS>
My
heart
-
strings
almost
broke
,
    
Unfit
my
mind
for
melody
,
      
Much
more
to
bear
a
joke
.
  
<EOS>
The
ladies
said
,
It
was
very
pretty
;
and
Miss
Darnford
,
That
somebody
else
had
more
need
to
be
concerned
than
the
versifier
.
  
<EOS>
I
knew
,
said
my
master
,
I
should
get
no
credit
by
shewing
this
.
 
<EOS>
But
let
us
read
on
,
Mr.
Williams
.
 
<EOS>
So
Mr.
Williams
read
:
                 
III
.
      
<EOS>
Then
they
,
to
whom
we
pris'ners
were
,
      
Said
to
us
,
tauntingly
,
    
<EOS>
Now
let
us
hear
your
Hebrew
songs
,
      
And
pleasant
melody
.
  
<EOS>
Now
this
,
said
my
master
,
is
very
near
;
and
read
:
                 
III
.
      
<EOS>
Then
she
,
to
whom
I
prisoner
was
,
      
Said
to
me
tauntingly
,
    
Now
cheer
your
heart
,
and
sing
a
song
,
      
And
tune
your
mind
to
joy
.
  
<EOS>
Mighty
sweet
,
said
Mr.
Williams
.
 
<EOS>
But
let
us
see
how
the
next
verse
is
turned
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
this
:
                  
IV
.
      
<EOS>
Alas
!
<EOS>
said
we
;
who
can
once
frame
      
<EOS>
His
heavy
heart
to
sing
    
The
praises
of
our
living
God
,
      
Thus
under
a
strange
king
?
  
<EOS>
Why
,
said
my
master
,
it
is
turned
with
beautiful
simplicity
,
thus
:
                  
IV
.
      
<EOS>
Alas
!
<EOS>
said
I
,
how
can
I
frame
      
<EOS>
My
heavy
heart
to
sing
,
    
Or
tune
my
mind
,
while
thus
enthrall'd
      
<EOS>
By
such
a
wicked
thing
?
  
<EOS>
Very
pretty
,
said
Mr.
Williams
.
 
<EOS>
Lady
Jones
said
,
O
,
dear
madam
!
<EOS>
could
you
wish
that
we
should
be
deprived
of
this
new
instance
of
your
genius
and
accomplishments
?
  
<EOS>
O
!
said
my
dear
father
,
you
will
make
my
good
child
proud
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
said
my
master
very
generously
,
Pamela
ca
n't
be
proud
.
 
<EOS>
For
no
one
is
proud
to
hear
themselves
praised
,
but
those
who
are
not
used
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
But
proceed
,
Mr.
Williams
.
 
<EOS>
He
read
:
                   
<EOS>
V.
      
But
yet
,
if
I
Jerusalem
      
Out
of
my
heart
let
slide
;
    
Then
let
my
fingers
quite
forget
      
<EOS>
The
warbling
harp
to
guide
.
  
<EOS>
Well
,
now
,
said
my
master
,
for
Pamela
's
version
:
                   
V.
      
<EOS>
But
yet
,
if
from
my
innocence
      
<EOS>
I
ev'n
in
thought
should
slide
,
    
Then
let
my
fingers
quite
forget
      
<EOS>
The
sweet
spinnet
to
guide
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Williams
read
:
                  
VI
.
      
<EOS>
And
let
my
tongue
,
within
my
mouth
,
      
Be
ty'd
for
ever
fast
,
    
If
I
rejoice
,
before
I
see
      
<EOS>
Thy
full
deliv'rance
past
.
  
<EOS>
This
,
also
,
said
my
master
,
is
very
near
:
                  
VI
.
      
<EOS>
And
let
my
tongue
,
within
my
mouth
,
      
Be
lock'd
for
ever
fast
,
    
If
I
rejoice
,
before
I
see
      
My
full
deliv'rance
past
.
  
<EOS>
Now
,
good
sir
,
said
I
,
oblige
me
;
do
n't
read
any
further
:
pray
do
n't
!
 
<EOS>
O
pray
,
madam
,
said
Mr.
Williams
,
let
me
beg
to
have
the
rest
read
;
for
I
long
to
know
whom
you
make
the
Sons
of
Edom
,
and
how
you
turn
the
Psalmist
's
execrations
against
the
insulting
Babylonians
.
  
<EOS>
Well
,
Mr.
Williams
,
replied
I
,
you
should
not
have
said
so
.
 
<EOS>
O
,
said
my
master
,
that
is
one
of
the
best
things
of
all
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
Mrs.
Jewkes
stands
for
Edom
's
Sons
;
and
we
must
not
lose
this
,
because
I
think
it
one
of
my
Pamela
's
excellencies
,
that
,
though
thus
oppressed
,
she
prays
for
no
harm
upon
the
oppressor
.
 
<EOS>
Read
,
Mr.
Williams
,
the
next
stanza
.
 
<EOS>
So
he
read
:
                 
VII
.
      
<EOS>
Therefore
,
O
Lord
!
<EOS>
remember
now
      
<EOS>
The
cursed
noise
and
cry
,
    
That
Edom
's
sons
against
us
made
,
      
<EOS>
When
they
ras'd
our
city
.
                
<EOS>
VIII
.
      
<EOS>
Remember
,
Lord
,
their
cruel
words
,
      
<EOS>
When
,
with
a
mighty
sound
,
    
They
cried
,
Down
,
yea
down
with
it
,
      
<EOS>
Unto
the
very
ground
!
  
<EOS>
Well
,
said
my
master
,
here
seems
,
in
what
I
am
going
to
read
,
a
little
bit
of
a
curse
indeed
,
but
I
think
it
makes
no
ill
figure
in
the
comparison
.
                 
<EOS>
VII
.
      
<EOS>
And
thou
,
Almighty
!
<EOS>
recompense
      
<EOS>
The
evils
I
endure
    
From
those
who
seek
my
sad
disgrace
,
      
So
causeless
,
to
procure
.
  
<EOS>
And
now
,
said
he
,
for
Edom
's
Sons
.
 
<EOS>
Though
a
little
severe
in
the
imputation
.
                
<EOS>
VIII
.
      
<EOS>
Remember
,
Lord
,
this
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
      
<EOS>
When
with
a
mighty
sound
,
    
She
cries
,
<EOS>
Down
with
her
chastity
,
      
Down
to
the
very
ground
!
  
<EOS>
Sure
,
sir
,
said
I
,
this
might
have
been
spared
!
 
<EOS>
But
the
ladies
and
Mr.
Williams
said
,
No
,
by
no
means
!
 
<EOS>
And
I
see
the
poor
wicked
woman
has
no
favourers
among
them
.
  
<EOS>
Now
,
said
my
master
,
read
the
Psalmist
's
heavy
curses
:
and
Mr.
Williams
read
:
                  
IX
.
      
<EOS>
Ev'n
<EOS>
so
shalt
thou
,
O
Babylon
!
      
<EOS>
At
length
to
dust
be
brought
:
    
And
happy
shall
<EOS>
that
man
be
call'd
,
      
<EOS>
That
our
revenge
hath
wrought
.
                   
<EOS>
X.
      
Yea
,
blessed
shall
the
man
be
call'd
      
<EOS>
That
takes
thy
little
ones
,
    
And
dasheth
them
in
pieces
<EOS>
small
      
Against
the
very
stones
.
  
<EOS>
Thus
he
said
,
very
kindly
,
has
my
Pamela
turned
these
lines
:
                  
IX
.
      
<EOS>
Ev'n
<EOS>
so
shalt
thou
,
O
wicked
one
!
      
<EOS>
At
length
to
shame
be
brought
;
    
And
happy
<EOS>
shall
all
those
be
<EOS>
call'd
,
      
<EOS>
That
my
deliv'rance
wrought
.
                   
<EOS>
X.
      
Yea
,
blessed
shall
the
man
be
call'd
      
<EOS>
That
shames
thee
of
thy
evil
,
    
And
saves
me
from
thy
vile
attempts
,
      
And
thee
,
too
,
from
the
d####l
.
  
<EOS>
I
fancy
this
blessed
man
,
said
my
master
smiling
,
was
,
at
that
time
,
<EOS>
hoped
to
be
you
,
Mr.
Williams
,
if
the
truth
was
known
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
said
he
,
whoever
it
was
intended
for
then
,
it
can
be
nobody
but
your
good
self
now
.
  
<EOS>
I
could
hardly
hold
up
my
head
for
the
praises
the
kind
ladies
were
pleased
to
heap
upon
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
sure
,
by
this
,
they
are
very
partial
in
my
favour
;
all
because
my
master
is
so
good
to
me
,
and
loves
to
hear
me
praised
;
for
I
see
no
such
excellence
in
these
lines
,
as
they
would
make
me
believe
,
besides
what
is
borrowed
from
the
Psalmist
.
  
<EOS>
We
all
,
as
before
,
and
the
cook
-
maid
too
,
attended
the
prayers
of
the
church
in
the
afternoon
;
and
my
dear
father
concluded
with
the
following
stanzas
of
the
cxlvth
psalm
;
suitably
magnifying
the
holy
name
of
God
for
all
mercies
;
but
did
not
observe
,
altogether
,
the
method
in
which
they
stand
;
which
was
the
less
necessary
,
he
thought
,
as
he
gave
out
the
lines
.
      
<EOS>
The
Lord
is
just
in
all
his
ways
:
      
<EOS>
His
works
are
holy
all
:
    
<EOS>
And
he
is
near
all
those
that
do
      
<EOS>
In
truth
upon
him
call
.
      
<EOS>
He
<EOS>
the
desires
of
all
them
      
<EOS>
That
fear
him
,
will
fulfil
;
    
And
he
will
hear
them
when
they
cry
,
      
And
save
them
all
he
will
.
      
<EOS>
The
eyes
of
all
do
wait
on
thee
;
      
Thou
dost
them
all
relieve
:
    
And
<EOS>
thou
to
each
sufficient
food
,
      
<EOS>
In
season
due
,
dost
give
.
      
<EOS>
Thou
<EOS>
openest
<EOS>
thy
plenteous
hand
,
      
And
bounteously
dost
<EOS>
fill
    
<EOS>
All
things
whatever
,
that
do
live
,
      
With
gifts
of
thy
good
will
.
      
<EOS>
My
thankful
mouth
shall
gladly
speak
      
<EOS>
The
praises
of
the
Lord
:
    
All
flesh
,
to
praise
his
holy
name
,
      
For
ever
shall
accord
.
  
<EOS>
We
walked
in
the
garden
till
tea
was
ready
;
and
as
he
went
by
the
back
-
door
,
my
master
said
to
me
,
<EOS>
Of
all
the
flowers
in
the
garden
,
the
sun
-
flower
is
the
fairest
!
 
<EOS>
O
,
sir
,
said
I
,
let
that
be
now
forgot
!
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Williams
heard
him
say
so
,
and
seemed
a
little
out
of
countenance
:
<EOS>
Whereupon
my
master
said
,
I
mean
not
to
make
you
serious
,
Mr.
Williams
;
but
we
see
how
strangely
things
are
brought
about
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
other
scenes
hereabouts
,
that
,
in
my
Pamela
's
dangers
,
give
me
more
cause
of
concern
,
than
any
thing
you
ever
did
should
give
you
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
said
he
,
you
are
very
generous
.
  
<EOS>
My
master
and
Mr.
Williams
afterwards
walked
together
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
;
and
talked
about
general
things
,
and
some
scholastic
subjects
;
and
joined
us
,
very
well
pleased
with
one
another
's
conversation
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Jones
said
,
putting
herself
on
one
side
of
me
,
as
my
master
was
on
the
other
,
But
pray
,
sir
,
when
is
the
happy
time
to
be
?
 
<EOS>
We
want
it
over
,
that
we
may
have
you
with
us
as
long
afterwards
as
you
can
.
 
<EOS>
Said
my
master
,
I
would
have
it
to
-
morrow
,
or
next
day
at
farthest
,
if
Pamela
will
:
for
I
have
sent
for
a
license
,
and
the
messenger
will
be
here
to
-
night
,
or
early
in
the
morning
,
I
hope
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
added
he
,
pray
,
<EOS>
Pamela
,
do
not
take
beyond
Thursday
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
pleased
to
say
<EOS>
,
Sure
it
will
not
be
delayed
by
you
,
madam
,
more
than
needs
!
 
<EOS>
Well
,
said
he
,
now
you
are
on
my
side
,
I
will
leave
you
with
her
to
settle
it
:
and
<EOS>
,
I
hope
,
she
will
not
let
little
bashful
niceties
be
important
with
her
;
and
so
he
joined
the
two
misses
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Jones
told
me
,
I
was
to
blame
,
she
would
take
upon
her
to
say
,
if
I
delayed
it
a
moment
;
because
she
understood
Lady
Davers
was
very
uneasy
at
the
prospect
,
that
it
would
be
so
;
and
if
any
thing
should
happen
,
it
would
be
a
sad
thing
!
 
<EOS>
Madam
,
said
I
,
when
he
was
pleased
to
mention
it
to
me
first
,
he
said
it
should
be
in
fourteen
days
;
and
afterwards
,
asked
me
if
I
would
have
it
in
the
first
or
the
second
seven
?
 
<EOS>
I
answered
 
for
how
could
I
do
otherwise
?
 
<EOS>
In
the
second
.
 
<EOS>
He
desired
it
might
not
be
the
last
day
of
the
second
seven
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
madam
,
said
I
,
as
he
was
then
pleased
to
speak
his
mind
,
no
doubt
,
I
would
not
,
for
any
thing
,
seem
too
forward
.
  
<EOS>
Well
,
but
,
said
she
,
as
he
now
urges
you
in
so
genteel
and
gentlemanly
a
manner
for
a
shorter
day
,
I
think
,
if
I
was
in
your
place
,
I
would
agree
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
She
saw
me
hesitate
and
blush
,
and
said
,
<EOS>
Well
,
you
know
best
;
but
I
say
only
what
I
would
do
.
 
<EOS>
I
said
,
I
would
consider
of
it
;
<EOS>
and
if
I
saw
he
was
very
earnest
,
to
be
sure
I
should
think
I
ought
to
oblige
him
.
  
<EOS>
Misses
Darnford
were
begging
to
be
at
the
wedding
,
and
to
have
a
ball
:
and
they
said
,
Pray
,
Mrs.
Andrews
,
second
our
requests
,
and
we
shall
be
greatly
obliged
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
ladies
,
said
I
,
<EOS>
I
can
not
promise
that
,
if
I
might
.
 
<EOS>
Why
so
?
said
they
.
 
<EOS>
Because
,
answered
I
 
<EOS>
I
know
not
what
!
<EOS>
But
I
think
one
may
,
with
pleasure
,
celebrate
an
anniversary
of
one
's
nuptials
;
but
the
day
itself
 
Indeed
,
ladies
,
I
think
it
is
too
solemn
a
business
,
for
the
parties
of
our
sex
to
be
very
gay
upon
:
it
is
a
quite
serious
and
awful
affair
:
and
I
am
sure
,
in
your
own
cases
,
you
would
be
of
my
mind
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
then
,
said
Miss
Darnford
,
<EOS>
the
more
need
one
has
to
be
as
light
-
hearted
and
merry
as
one
can
.
  
<EOS>
I
told
you
,
said
my
master
,
what
sort
of
an
answer
you
'd
have
from
Pamela
.
 
<EOS>
The
younger
miss
said
,
She
never
heard
of
such
grave
folks
in
her
life
,
on
such
an
occasion
<EOS>
:
Why
,
sir
,
said
she
,
I
hope
you
'll
sing
psalms
all
day
,
and
miss
will
fast
and
pray
!
 
<EOS>
Such
sackcloth
and
ashes
doings
,
for
a
wedding
,
did
I
never
hear
of
!
 
<EOS>
She
spoke
a
little
spitefully
,
I
thought
;
and
I
returned
no
answer
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
have
enough
to
do
,
I
reckon
,
in
a
while
,
if
I
am
to
answer
every
one
that
will
envy
me
!
  
<EOS>
We
went
in
to
tea
;
and
all
that
the
ladies
could
prevail
upon
my
master
for
,
was
a
dancing
match
before
he
left
this
county
:
<EOS>
But
Miss
Darnford
said
,
It
should
then
be
at
their
house
;
for
,
truly
,
if
she
might
not
be
at
the
wedding
,
she
would
be
affronted
,
and
come
no
more
hither
,
till
we
had
been
there
.
  
<EOS>
When
they
were
gone
,
my
master
would
have
had
my
father
stay
till
the
affair
was
over
;
but
he
begged
he
might
set
out
as
soon
as
it
was
light
in
the
morning
;
for
,
he
said
,
my
mother
would
be
doubly
uneasy
at
his
stay
;
and
he
burned
with
impatience
to
let
her
know
all
the
happy
things
that
had
befallen
her
daughter
.
 
<EOS>
When
my
master
found
him
so
desirous
to
go
,
he
called
Mr.
Thomas
,
and
ordered
him
to
get
a
particular
bay
horse
ready
betimes
in
the
morning
,
for
my
father
,
and
a
portmanteau
,
to
put
his
things
in
;
and
to
attend
him
a
day
's
journey
:
<EOS>
And
if
,
said
he
,
Mr.
Andrews
chooses
it
,
see
him
safe
to
his
own
home
:
<EOS>
And
,
added
he
,
since
that
horse
will
serve
you
,
Mr.
Andrews
,
to
ride
backwards
and
forwards
,
to
see
us
,
<EOS>
when
we
go
into
Bedfordshire
,
I
make
you
a
present
of
it
,
with
the
accoutrements
.
 
<EOS>
And
,
seeing
my
father
going
to
speak
,
he
added
,
I
wo
n't
be
said
nay
.
 
<EOS>
O
how
good
was
this
!
  
<EOS>
He
also
said
a
great
many
kind
things
at
supper
-
time
,
and
gave
him
all
the
papers
he
had
of
mine
;
but
desired
,
when
he
and
my
mother
had
read
them
,
that
he
would
return
them
to
him
again
.
 
<EOS>
And
then
he
said
,
<EOS>
So
affectionate
a
father
and
daughter
<EOS>
may
,
perhaps
,
be
glad
to
be
alone
together
;
therefore
remember
me
to
your
good
wife
,
and
tell
her
,
it
will
not
be
long
,
I
hope
,
before
I
see
you
together
;
on
a
visit
to
your
daughter
,
at
my
other
house
:
and
so
I
wish
you
good
night
,
and
a
good
journey
,
if
you
go
before
I
see
you
.
 
<EOS>
And
then
he
shook
hands
,
and
left
my
dear
father
almost
unable
to
speak
,
through
the
sense
of
his
favours
and
goodness
.
  
<EOS>
You
may
believe
,
my
dear
mother
,
how
loath
I
was
to
part
with
my
good
father
;
and
he
was
also
unwilling
to
part
with
me
;
but
he
was
so
impatient
to
see
you
,
and
tell
you
the
blessed
tidings
,
with
which
his
heart
overflowed
,
that
I
could
hardly
wish
to
detain
him
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
brought
two
bottles
of
cherry
-
brandy
,
and
two
of
cinnamon
-
water
,
and
some
cake
;
and
they
were
put
up
in
the
portmanteau
,
with
my
father
's
newly
presented
clothes
;
for
he
said
,
He
would
not
,
for
any
thing
,
be
seen
in
them
in
his
neighbourhood
,
till
I
was
actually
known
,
by
every
body
,
to
be
married
;
nor
would
he
lay
out
any
part
of
the
twenty
guineas
till
then
neither
,
for
fear
of
reflections
;
and
then
he
would
consult
me
as
to
what
he
would
buy
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
said
I
,
as
you
please
,
<EOS>
my
dear
father
;
and
I
hope
now
we
shall
often
have
the
pleasure
of
hearing
from
one
another
,
without
needing
any
art
or
contrivances
.
  
<EOS>
He
said
,
He
would
go
to
bed
betimes
,
that
he
might
be
up
as
soon
as
it
was
light
;
and
so
he
took
leave
of
me
,
and
said
,
He
would
not
love
me
,
if
I
got
up
in
the
morning
to
see
him
go
;
which
would
but
make
us
both
loath
to
part
,
and
grieve
us
both
all
day
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Thomas
brought
him
a
pair
of
boots
,
and
told
him
,
He
would
call
him
up
at
peep
of
day
,
and
put
up
every
thing
over
night
;
and
so
I
received
his
blessing
,
and
his
prayers
,
and
his
kind
promises
of
procuring
the
same
from
you
,
my
dear
mother
;
and
went
up
to
my
closet
with
a
heavy
heart
,
and
yet
a
half
-
pleased
one
,
if
I
may
so
say
;
for
that
,
as
he
must
go
,
he
was
going
to
the
best
of
wives
,
and
with
the
best
of
tidings
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
begged
he
would
not
work
so
hard
as
he
had
done
;
for
I
was
sure
my
master
would
not
have
given
him
twenty
guineas
for
clothes
,
if
he
had
not
designed
to
do
something
else
for
him
;
and
that
he
should
be
the
less
concerned
at
receiving
benefits
,
from
my
good
master
,
because
he
,
who
had
so
many
persons
to
employ
in
his
large
possessions
,
could
make
him
serviceable
,
to
a
degree
equivalent
,
without
hurting
any
body
else
.
  
<EOS>
He
promised
me
fair
;
and
,
pray
,
dear
mother
,
see
he
performs
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
my
master
will
not
see
this
:
for
I
will
not
send
it
you
,
at
present
,
till
I
can
send
you
the
best
of
news
;
and
the
rather
,
as
my
dear
father
can
supply
the
greatest
part
of
what
I
have
written
,
since
the
papers
he
carries
you
,
by
his
own
observation
.
 
<EOS>
So
good
night
,
my
dear
mother
:
<EOS>
And
God
send
my
father
a
safe
journey
,
and
a
happy
meeting
to
you
both
!
  
<EOS>
Monday
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Colbrand
being
returned
,
my
master
came
up
to
me
to
my
closet
,
and
brought
me
the
license
.
 
<EOS>
O
how
my
heart
fluttered
at
the
sight
of
it
!
<EOS>
Now
,
Pamela
,
said
he
,
tell
me
,
if
you
can
oblige
me
with
the
day
.
 
<EOS>
Your
word
is
all
that
's
wanting
.
 
<EOS>
I
made
bold
to
kiss
his
dear
hand
;
and
,
though
unable
to
look
up
,
said
 
I
know
not
what
to
say
,
sir
,
to
all
your
goodness
<EOS>
:
I
would
not
,
for
any
consideration
,
that
you
should
believe
me
capable
of
receiving
negligently
an
honour
,
that
all
the
duty
of
a
long
life
,
were
it
to
be
lent
me
,
will
not
be
sufficient
to
enable
me
to
be
grateful
for
.
 
<EOS>
I
ought
to
resign
myself
,
in
every
thing
I
may
or
can
,
implicitly
to
your
will
.
 
<EOS>
But
 
<EOS>
But
what
?
<EOS>
said
he
,
with
a
kind
impatience
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
sir
,
said
I
,
when
from
last
Thursday
you
mentioned
four
days
,
I
had
reason
to
think
that
term
your
choice
;
and
my
heart
is
so
wholly
yours
,
that
I
am
afraid
of
nothing
,
but
that
I
may
be
forwarder
than
you
wish
.
 
<EOS>
Impossible
,
my
dear
creature
!
<EOS>
said
he
,
and
folded
me
in
his
arms
:
<EOS>
Impossible
!
 
<EOS>
If
this
be
all
,
it
shall
be
set
about
this
moment
,
and
this
happy
day
shall
make
you
mine
!
 
<EOS>
I
'll
send
away
instantly
,
said
the
dear
gentleman
;
and
was
going
.
  
<EOS>
I
said
,
No
,
pray
,
sir
,
pray
,
sir
,
hear
me
!
 
<EOS>
Indeed
it
can
not
be
to
-
day
!
  
<EOS>
Can
not
!
said
he
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
indeed
,
sir
!
<EOS>
said
I
 
<EOS>
And
was
ready
to
sink
to
see
his
generous
impatience
.
 
<EOS>
Why
flattered
you
then
my
fond
heart
,
replied
he
,
with
the
hope
that
it
might
?
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
said
I
,
I
will
tell
you
what
I
had
thought
,
if
you
'll
vouchsafe
me
your
attention
.
 
<EOS>
Do
then
,
said
he
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
,
sir
,
proceeded
I
,
a
great
desire
,
that
,
whenever
the
day
is
,
it
may
be
on
a
Thursday
:
On
a
Thursday
my
dear
father
and
mother
were
married
;
and
,
<EOS>
though
poor
,
they
are
a
very
happy
pair
.
 
<EOS>
On
a
Thursday
your
poor
Pamela
was
born
.
 
<EOS>
On
a
Thursday
my
dear
good
lady
took
me
from
my
parents
into
her
protection
.
 
<EOS>
On
a
Thursday
,
sir
,
you
caused
me
to
be
carried
away
to
this
place
,
to
which
I
now
,
by
God
's
goodness
,
and
your
favour
,
owe
so
amazingly
all
my
present
prospects
;
and
on
a
Thursday
it
was
,
you
named
to
me
,
that
fourteen
days
from
that
you
would
confirm
my
happiness
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
sir
,
if
you
please
to
indulge
my
superstitious
folly
,
you
will
greatly
oblige
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
sorry
,
<EOS>
sir
,
for
this
reason
,
when
you
bid
me
not
defer
till
the
last
day
of
the
fourteen
,
that
Thursday
in
next
week
was
that
last
day
.
  
<EOS>
This
,
Pamela
,
is
a
little
superstitious
,
I
must
needs
say
;
and
I
think
you
should
begin
now
to
make
another
day
in
the
week
a
happy
one
;
as
for
example
;
on
a
Monday
,
may
you
say
,
my
father
and
mother
concluded
to
be
married
on
the
Thursday
following
.
 
<EOS>
On
a
Monday
,
so
many
years
ago
,
my
mother
was
preparing
all
her
matters
to
be
brought
to
bed
on
the
Thursday
following
.
 
<EOS>
On
a
Monday
,
several
weeks
ago
,
it
was
that
you
had
but
two
days
more
to
stay
,
till
you
was
carried
away
on
Thursday
.
 
<EOS>
On
a
Monday
,
I
myself
,
said
he
,
well
remember
,
it
was
that
I
wrote
you
the
letter
,
that
prevailed
on
you
so
kindly
to
return
to
me
;
and
on
the
same
day
you
did
return
to
my
house
here
;
which
I
hope
,
my
girl
,
will
be
as
propitious
an
era
as
any
you
have
named
:
<EOS>
And
now
,
lastly
,
will
you
say
,
which
will
crown
the
work
;
<EOS>
And
,
on
a
Monday
I
was
married
.
 
<EOS>
Come
,
come
,
my
dear
,
added
he
,
Thursday
has
reigned
long
enough
o'conscience
;
let
us
now
set
Monday
in
its
place
,
or
at
least
on
an
equality
with
it
,
since
you
see
it
has
a
very
good
title
,
and
as
we
now
stand
in
the
week
before
us
,
claims
priority
:
<EOS>
And
then
,
I
hope
,
we
shall
make
Tuesday
,
Wednesday
,
Friday
,
Saturday
,
and
Sunday
,
as
happy
days
as
Monday
and
Thursday
;
and
<EOS>
so
,
by
God
's
blessing
,
move
round
,
as
the
days
move
,
in
a
delightful
circle
,
till
we
are
at
a
loss
what
day
to
prefer
to
the
rest
.
  
<EOS>
O
how
charmingly
was
this
said
!
 
<EOS>
And
how
sweetly
kind
!
  
<EOS>
Indeed
,
sir
,
said
I
,
you
rally
my
folly
very
agreeably
;
but
do
n't
let
a
little
matter
stand
in
the
way
,
when
you
are
so
generously
obliging
in
a
greater
:
<EOS>
Indeed
I
like
Thursday
best
,
if
I
may
choose
.
  
<EOS>
Well
,
then
,
said
he
,
if
you
can
say
you
have
a
better
reason
than
this
,
I
will
oblige
you
;
else
I
'll
send
away
for
the
parson
this
moment
.
  
<EOS>
And
so
,
I
protest
,
he
was
going
!
 
<EOS>
Dear
sirs
,
how
I
trembled
!
 
<EOS>
Stay
,
stay
,
sir
,
said
I
:
we
have
a
great
deal
to
say
first
;
I
have
a
deal
of
silly
prate
to
trouble
you
with
!
 
<EOS>
Well
,
say
then
,
in
a
minute
,
replied
he
,
the
most
material
:
for
all
we
have
to
say
may
be
talked
of
while
the
parson
is
coming
.
 
<EOS>
O
,
but
indeed
,
and
indeed
,
said
I
,
it
can
not
be
to
-
day
!
  
<EOS>
Well
,
then
,
shall
it
be
to
-
morrow
?
<EOS>
said
he
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
sir
,
if
it
must
not
be
on
a
Thursday
,
you
have
given
so
many
pleasant
distinctions
for
a
Monday
,
<EOS>
that
let
it
then
be
next
Monday
.
 
<EOS>
What
!
<EOS>
a
week
still
?
<EOS>
said
he
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
answered
I
,
if
you
please
;
for
that
will
be
,
as
you
enjoined
,
within
the
second
seven
days
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
girl
,
said
he
,
'
twill
be
seven
months
till
next
Monday
.
 
<EOS>
Let
it
,
said
he
,
if
not
to
-
morrow
,
be
on
Wednesday
;
I
protest
I
will
stay
no
longer
.
  
<EOS>
Then
,
sir
,
returned
I
,
please
to
defer
it
,
however
,
for
one
day
more
,
and
it
will
be
my
beloved
Thursday
!
 
<EOS>
If
I
consent
to
defer
it
till
then
,
may
I
hope
,
my
Pamela
,
said
he
,
that
next
Thursday
shall
certainly
be
the
happy
day
?
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
sir
,
said
I
and
I
am
sure
I
looked
very
foolishly
!
  
<EOS>
And
yet
,
my
dear
father
and
mother
,
why
should
I
,
with
such
a
fine
gentleman
?
 
<EOS>
And
whom
I
so
dearly
love
?
 
<EOS>
And
so
much
to
my
honour
too
?
<EOS>
But
there
is
something
greatly
awful
upon
my
mind
,
in
the
solemn
circumstance
,
and
a
change
of
condition
never
to
be
recalled
,
though
all
the
prospects
are
so
desirable
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
can
but
wonder
at
the
thoughtless
precipitancy
with
which
most
young
folks
run
into
this
important
change
of
life
!
  
<EOS>
So
now
,
my
dear
parents
,
have
I
been
brought
to
fix
so
near
a
day
as
next
Thursday
;
and
this
is
Monday
.
 
<EOS>
O
dear
,
it
makes
one
out
of
breath
almost
to
think
of
it
!
 
<EOS>
This
,
though
,
was
a
great
cut
off
;
a
whole
week
out
of
ten
days
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
I
am
not
too
forward
!
 
<EOS>
I
'm
sure
,
if
it
obliges
my
dear
master
,
I
am
justified
;
for
he
deserves
of
me
all
things
in
my
poor
power
.
  
<EOS>
After
this
,
he
rode
out
on
horseback
,
attended
by
Abraham
,
and
did
not
return
till
night
.
 
<EOS>
How
by
degrees
things
steal
upon
one
!
 
<EOS>
I
thought
even
this
small
absence
tedious
;
and
the
more
,
as
we
expected
him
home
to
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
I
may
not
be
too
fond
,
and
make
him
indifferent
:
<EOS>
But
yet
,
my
dear
father
and
mother
,
you
were
always
fond
of
one
another
,
and
never
indifferent
,
let
the
world
run
as
it
would
.
  
<EOS>
When
he
returned
,
he
said
,
He
had
had
a
pleasant
ride
,
and
was
led
out
to
a
greater
distance
than
he
intended
.
 
<EOS>
At
supper
he
told
me
,
that
he
had
a
great
mind
Mr.
Williams
should
marry
us
;
because
,
he
said
,
it
would
shew
a
thorough
reconciliation
on
his
part
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
said
he
,
most
generously
,
I
am
apprehensive
,
from
what
passed
between
you
,
that
the
poor
man
will
take
it
hardly
,
and
as
a
sort
of
insult
,
which
I
am
not
capable
of
.
 
<EOS>
What
says
my
girl
?
 
<EOS>
Do
you
think
he
would
?
 
<EOS>
I
hope
not
,
sir
,
said
I
:
<EOS>
As
to
what
he
may
think
,
I
ca
n't
answer
;
but
as
to
any
reason
for
his
thoughts
,
I
can
:
<EOS>
For
indeed
,
sir
,
said
I
,
you
have
been
already
so
generous
,
that
he
can
not
,
I
think
,
mistake
your
goodness
.
  
<EOS>
He
then
spoke
with
some
resentment
of
Lady
Davers
's
behaviour
,
and
I
asked
,
if
any
thing
new
had
occurred
?
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
said
he
;
I
have
had
a
letter
delivered
me
from
her
impertinent
husband
,
professedly
at
her
instigation
,
that
amounted
to
little
less
than
a
piece
of
insolent
bravery
,
on
supposing
<EOS>
I
was
about
to
marry
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
so
provoked
,
added
he
,
that
after
I
had
read
it
,
I
tore
it
in
a
hundred
pieces
,
and
scattered
them
in
the
air
,
and
bid
the
man
who
brought
it
let
his
master
know
what
I
had
done
with
his
letter
;
and
so
would
not
permit
him
to
speak
to
me
,
as
he
would
fain
have
done
,
 
<EOS>
I
think
the
fellow
talked
somewhat
of
his
lady
coming
hither
;
but
she
shall
not
set
her
foot
within
my
doors
;
and
I
suppose
this
treatment
will
hinder
her
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
much
concerned
at
this
:
<EOS>
And
he
said
,
Had
I
a
hundred
sisters
,
Pamela
,
their
opposition
should
have
no
weight
with
me
:
and
I
did
not
intend
you
should
know
it
;
but
you
ca
n't
but
expect
a
little
difficulty
from
the
pride
of
my
sister
,
who
have
suffered
so
much
from
that
of
her
brother
;
and
we
are
too
nearly
allied
in
mind
,
as
well
as
blood
,
I
find
.
  
<EOS>
B
ut
<EOS>
this
is
not
her
business
:
<EOS>
And
if
she
would
have
made
it
so
,
she
should
have
done
it
with
more
decency
.
 
<EOS>
Little
occasion
had
she
to
boast
of
her
birth
,
that
knows
not
what
belongs
to
good
manners
.
  
<EOS>
I
said
,
I
am
very
sorry
,
sir
,
to
be
the
unhappy
occasion
of
a
misunderstanding
between
so
good
a
brother
and
so
worthy
a
sister
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
say
so
,
Pamela
,
because
this
is
an
unavoidable
consequence
of
the
happy
prospect
before
us
.
 
<EOS>
Only
bear
it
well
yourself
,
because
she
is
my
sister
;
and
leave
it
to
me
to
make
her
sensible
of
her
own
rashness
.
  
<EOS>
If
,
sir
,
said
I
,
the
most
lowly
behaviour
,
and
humble
deportment
,
and
in
every
thing
shewing
a
dutiful
regard
to
good
Lady
Davers
,
will
have
any
weight
with
her
ladyship
,
assure
yourself
of
all
in
my
power
to
mollify
her
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
Pamela
,
returned
he
<EOS>
;
do
n't
imagine
,
when
you
are
my
wife
,
I
will
suffer
you
to
do
any
thing
unworthy
of
that
character
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
the
duty
of
a
husband
,
and
will
protect
your
gentleness
to
the
utmost
,
as
much
as
if
you
were
a
princess
by
descent
.
  
<EOS>
You
are
inexpressibly
good
,
sir
,
said
I
;
but
I
am
far
from
taking
a
gentle
disposition
to
shew
a
meanness
of
spirit
:
<EOS>
And
this
is
a
trial
I
ought
to
expect
;
and
well
I
may
bear
it
,
that
have
so
many
benefits
to
set
against
it
,
which
all
spring
from
the
same
cause
.
  
<EOS>
Well
,
said
he
,
all
the
matter
shall
be
this
<EOS>
:
We
will
talk
of
our
marriage
as
a
thing
to
be
done
next
week
.
 
<EOS>
I
find
I
have
spies
upon
me
wherever
I
go
,
and
whatever
I
do
:
<EOS>
But
now
,
I
am
on
so
laudable
a
pursuit
,
that
I
value
them
not
,
nor
those
who
employ
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
already
ordered
my
servants
to
have
no
conference
with
any
body
for
ten
or
twelve
days
to
come
.
 
<EOS>
And
Mrs.
Jewkes
tells
me
every
one
names
Thursday
come
se'nnight
for
our
nuptials
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
will
get
Mr.
Peters
,
who
wants
to
see
my
little
chapel
,
to
assist
Mr.
Williams
,
under
the
notion
of
breakfasting
with
me
next
Thursday
morning
,
since
you
wo
n't
have
it
sooner
;
and
there
will
nobody
else
be
wanting
;
and
I
will
beg
of
Mr.
Peters
to
keep
it
private
,
even
from
his
own
family
,
for
a
few
days
.
 
<EOS>
Has
my
girl
any
objection
?
  
<EOS>
O
,
sir
,
answered
I
,
you
are
so
generous
in
all
your
ways
,
I
can
have
no
objections
!
 
<EOS>
But
I
hope
Lady
Davers
and
you
will
not
proceed
to
irreconcilable
lengths
;
and
when
her
ladyship
comes
to
see
you
,
and
to
tarry
with
you
,
two
or
three
weeks
,
as
she
used
to
do
,
I
will
keep
close
up
,
so
as
not
to
disgust
her
with
the
sight
of
me
.
  
<EOS>
Well
,
Pamela
,
said
he
,
we
will
talk
of
that
afterwards
.
 
<EOS>
You
must
do
then
as
I
shall
think
fit
:
<EOS>
And
I
shall
be
able
to
judge
what
both
you
and
I
ought
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
But
what
still
aggravates
the
matter
is
,
that
she
should
instigate
the
titled
ape
her
husband
to
write
to
me
,
after
she
had
so
little
succeeded
herself
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
I
had
kept
his
letter
,
that
I
might
have
shewn
you
how
a
man
,
that
generally
acts
like
a
fool
,
can
take
upon
him
to
write
like
a
lord
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
suppose
it
is
of
my
sister
's
penning
,
and
he
,
poor
man
!
<EOS>
is
the
humble
copier
.
  
<EOS>
Tuesday
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Thomas
is
returned
from
you
,
my
dear
father
,
with
the
good
news
of
your
health
,
and
your
proceeding
in
your
journey
to
my
dear
mother
,
where
I
hope
to
hear
soon
you
are
arrived
.
 
<EOS>
My
master
has
just
now
been
making
me
play
upon
the
spinnet
,
and
sing
to
it
;
and
was
pleased
to
commend
me
for
both
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
does
so
for
every
thing
I
do
<EOS>
,
so
partial
does
his
goodness
make
him
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
One
o'clock
.
  
<EOS>
We
are
just
returned
from
an
airing
in
the
chariot
;
and
I
have
been
delighted
with
his
conversation
upon
English
authors
,
poets
particularly
.
<EOS>
He
entertained
me
also
with
a
description
of
some
of
the
curiosities
he
had
seen
in
Italy
and
France
,
when
he
made
what
the
polite
world
call
the
grand
tour
.
 
<EOS>
He
said
he
wanted
to
be
at
his
other
seat
,
for
he
knew
not
well
how
to
employ
himself
here
,
having
not
proposed
to
stay
half
the
time
:
<EOS>
And
when
I
get
there
,
Pamela
,
said
he
,
you
will
hardly
be
troubled
with
so
much
of
my
company
,
after
we
have
settled
;
for
I
have
a
great
many
things
to
adjust
:
<EOS>
And
I
must
go
to
London
;
<EOS>
for
I
have
accounts
that
have
run
on
longer
than
ordinary
with
my
banker
there
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
do
n't
know
,
added
he
,
but
the
ensuing
winter
I
may
give
you
a
little
taste
of
the
diversions
of
the
town
for
a
month
or
so
.
 
<EOS>
I
said
,
His
will
and
pleasure
should
determine
mine
;
and
I
never
would
,
as
near
as
I
could
,
have
a
desire
after
those
,
or
any
other
entertainments
that
were
not
in
his
own
choice
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
pleased
to
say
<EOS>
,
I
make
no
doubt
but
<EOS>
that
I
shall
be
very
happy
in
you
;
and
hope
you
will
be
so
in
me
:
For
,
said
he
,
I
have
no
very
enormous
vices
to
gratify
;
though
I
pretend
not
to
the
greatest
purity
,
neither
,
my
girl
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
said
I
,
if
you
can
account
to
your
own
mind
,
I
shall
always
be
easy
in
whatever
you
do
.
 
<EOS>
But
our
greatest
happiness
here
,
sir
,
continued
I
,
<EOS>
is
of
very
short
duration
;
and
this
life
,
at
the
longest
,
is
a
poor
transitory
one
;
and
I
hope
we
shall
be
so
happy
as
to
be
enabled
to
look
forward
,
with
comfort
,
to
another
,
where
our
pleasures
will
be
everlasting
.
  
<EOS>
You
say
well
,
Pamela
;
and
I
shall
,
by
degrees
,
be
more
habituated
to
this
way
of
thinking
,
as
I
more
and
more
converse
with
you
;
but
,
at
present
,
you
must
not
be
over
serious
with
me
all
at
once
:
though
I
charge
you
never
forbear
to
mingle
your
sweet
divinity
in
our
conversation
,
whenever
it
can
be
brought
in
a
propos
,
and
with
such
a
cheerfulness
of
temper
,
as
shall
not
throw
a
gloomy
cloud
over
our
innocent
enjoyments
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
abashed
at
this
,
and
silent
,
fearing
I
had
offended
:
<EOS>
But
he
said
,
If
you
attend
rightly
to
what
I
said
,
I
need
not
tell
you
again
,
Pamela
,
not
to
be
discouraged
from
suggesting
to
me
,
on
every
proper
occasion
,
the
pious
impulses
of
your
own
amiable
mind
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
said
I
,
you
will
be
always
indulgent
<EOS>
,
I
make
no
doubt
,
to
my
imperfections
,
so
long
as
I
mean
well
.
  
<EOS>
My
master
made
me
dine
with
him
,
and
would
eat
nothing
but
what
I
helped
him
to
;
and
my
heart
is
,
every
hour
,
more
and
more
enlarged
with
his
goodness
and
condescension
.
 
<EOS>
But
still
,
what
ails
me
,
I
wonder
!
 
<EOS>
A
strange
sort
of
weight
hangs
upon
my
mind
,
as
Thursday
draws
on
,
which
makes
me
often
sigh
involuntarily
,
and
damps
,
at
times
,
the
pleasures
of
my
delightful
prospects
!
 
<EOS>
I
hope
this
is
not
ominous
;
but
only
the
foolish
weakness
of
an
over
-
thoughtful
mind
,
on
an
occasion
the
most
solemn
and
important
of
one
's
life
,
next
to
the
last
scene
,
which
shuts
up
all
.
  
<EOS>
I
could
be
very
serious
:
<EOS>
But
I
will
commit
all
my
ways
to
that
blessed
Providence
,
which
hitherto
has
so
wonderfully
conducted
me
through
real
evils
to
this
hopeful
situation
.
  
<EOS>
I
only
fear
,
and
surely
I
have
great
reason
,
that
I
shall
be
too
unworthy
to
hold
the
affections
of
so
dear
a
gentleman
!
 
<EOS>
God
teach
me
humility
,
and
to
know
my
own
demerit
!
 
<EOS>
And
this
will
be
,
<EOS>
next
to
his
grace
,
my
surest
guard
,
in
the
state
of
life
to
which
,
though
most
unworthy
,
I
am
going
to
be
exalted
.
 
<EOS>
And
do
n't
cease
your
prayers
for
me
,
my
dear
parents
;
for
,
perhaps
,
this
new
condition
may
be
subject
to
still
worse
hazards
than
those
I
have
escaped
;
as
would
be
the
case
,
were
conceitedness
,
vanity
,
and
pride
,
to
take
hold
of
my
frail
heart
;
and
if
I
was
,
for
my
sins
,
to
be
left
to
my
own
conduct
,
a
frail
bark
in
a
tempestuous
ocean
,
without
ballast
,
or
other
pilot
than
my
own
inconsiderate
will
.
 
<EOS>
But
my
master
said
,
on
another
occasion
,
That
those
who
doubted
most
,
always
erred
least
;
and
I
hope
I
shall
always
doubt
my
own
strength
,
my
own
worthiness
.
  
<EOS>
I
will
not
trouble
you
with
twenty
sweet
agreeable
things
that
passed
in
conversation
with
my
excellent
benefactor
;
nor
with
the
civilities
of
M.
Colbrand
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
and
all
the
servants
,
who
seem
to
be
highly
pleased
with
me
,
and
with
my
conduct
to
them
:
<EOS>
And
as
my
master
,
hitherto
,
finds
no
fault
that
I
go
too
low
,
nor
they
that
I
carry
it
too
high
<EOS>
,
I
hope
I
shall
continue
to
have
every
body
's
good
-
will
:
But
yet
will
I
not
seek
to
gain
any
one
's
by
little
meannesses
or
debasements
!
<EOS>
but
aim
at
an
uniform
and
regular
conduct
,
willing
to
conceal
involuntary
errors
,
as
I
would
have
my
own
forgiven
;
and
not
too
industrious
to
discover
real
ones
,
or
to
hide
such
,
if
any
such
should
appear
,
as
might
encourage
bad
hearts
,
or
unclean
hands
,
in
material
cases
,
where
my
master
should
receive
damage
,
or
where
the
morals
of
the
transgressors
should
appear
wilfully
and
habitually
corrupt
.
 
<EOS>
In
short
,
I
will
endeavour
,
as
much
as
I
can
,
that
good
servants
shall
find
in
me
a
kind
encourager
;
indifferent
ones
be
made
better
,
by
inspiring
them
with
a
laudable
emulation
;
and
bad
ones
,
if
not
too
bad
in
nature
,
and
quite
irreclaimable
,
reformed
by
kindness
,
expostulation
,
and
even
proper
menaces
,
if
necessary
;
but
most
by
a
good
example
:
All
this
if
God
pleases
.
  
<EOS>
Wednesday
.
  
<EOS>
Now
,
my
dear
parents
,
I
have
<EOS>
but
this
one
day
between
me
and
the
most
solemn
rite
that
can
be
performed
.
 
<EOS>
My
heart
can
not
yet
shake
off
this
heavy
weight
.
 
<EOS>
Sure
I
am
ungrateful
to
the
divine
goodness
,
and
the
favour
of
the
best
of
benefactors
!
 
<EOS>
Yet
I
hope
I
am
not
!
 
<EOS>
For
,
at
times
,
my
mind
is
all
exultation
,
with
the
prospect
of
what
good
to
-
morrow
's
happy
solemnity
may
possibly
,
by
the
leave
of
my
generous
master
,
put
it
in
my
power
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
O
how
shall
I
find
words
to
express
,
as
I
ought
,
<EOS>
my
thankfulness
,
for
all
the
mercies
before
me
!
  
<EOS>
Wednesday
evening
.
  
<EOS>
My
dear
master
is
all
love
and
tenderness
.
 
<EOS>
He
sees
my
weakness
,
and
generously
pities
and
comforts
me
!
 
<EOS>
I
begged
to
be
excused
supper
;
but
he
brought
me
down
himself
from
my
closet
,
and
placed
me
by
him
,
bidding
Abraham
not
wait
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
eat
,
and
<EOS>
yet
I
tried
,
for
fear
he
should
be
angry
.
 
<EOS>
He
kindly
forbore
to
hint
any
thing
of
the
dreadful
,
yet
delightful
to
-
morrow
!
<EOS>
and
put
,
now
and
then
,
a
little
bit
on
my
plate
,
and
guided
it
to
my
mouth
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
concerned
to
receive
his
goodness
with
so
ill
a
grace
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
said
he
,
if
you
wo
n't
eat
with
me
,
drink
at
least
with
me
:
I
drank
two
glasses
by
his
over
-
persuasions
,
and
said
,
I
am
really
ashamed
of
myself
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
indeed
,
said
he
,
my
dear
girl
,
I
am
not
a
very
dreadful
enemy
,
I
hope
!
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
bear
any
thing
that
is
the
least
concerning
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
sir
!
<EOS>
said
I
,
all
is
owing
to
the
sense
I
have
of
my
own
unworthiness
!
 
<EOS>
To
be
sure
,
it
can
not
be
any
thing
else
.
  
<EOS>
He
rung
for
the
things
to
be
taken
away
;
and
then
reached
a
chair
,
and
sat
down
by
me
,
and
put
his
kind
arms
about
me
,
and
said
the
most
generous
and
affecting
things
that
ever
dropt
from
the
honey
-
flowing
mouth
of
love
.
 
<EOS>
All
I
have
not
time
to
repeat
:
some
I
will
.
 
<EOS>
And
oh
!
indulge
your
foolish
daughter
,
who
troubles
you
with
her
weak
nonsense
;
because
what
she
has
to
say
,
is
so
affecting
to
her
;
and
because
,
if
she
went
to
bed
,
instead
of
scribbling
,
she
could
not
sleep
.
  
<EOS>
This
sweet
confusion
and
thoughtfulness
in
my
beloved
Pamela
,
said
the
kind
man
,
on
the
near
approach
of
our
happy
union
,
when
I
hope
all
doubts
are
cleared
up
,
and
nothing
of
dishonour
is
apprehended
,
shew
me
most
abundantly
,
what
a
wretch
I
was
to
attempt
such
purity
with
a
worse
intention
 
<EOS>
No
wonder
,
that
one
so
virtuous
should
find
herself
deserted
of
life
itself
on
a
violence
so
dreadful
to
her
honour
,
and
seek
a
refuge
in
the
shadow
of
death
.
 
<EOS>
But
now
,
my
dearest
Pamela
,
that
you
have
seen
a
purity
on
my
side
,
as
nearly
imitating
your
own
,
as
our
sex
can
shew
to
yours
;
and
since
I
have
,
all
the
day
long
,
suppressed
even
the
least
intimation
of
the
coming
days
,
that
I
might
not
alarm
your
tender
mind
;
why
all
this
concern
,
why
all
this
affecting
,
yet
sweet
confusion
?
 
<EOS>
You
have
a
generous
friend
,
my
dear
girl
,
in
me
;
a
protector
now
,
not
a
violator
of
your
innocence
:
Why
then
,
once
more
I
ask
,
this
strange
perplexity
,
this
sweet
confusion
?
  
<EOS>
O
sir
,
said
I
,
and
hid
my
face
on
his
arm
;
expect
not
reason
from
a
foolish
creature
:
You
should
have
still
indulged
me
in
my
closet
:
I
am
ready
to
beat
myself
for
this
ungrateful
return
to
your
goodness
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
know
not
what
!
 
<EOS>
I
am
,
to
be
sure
,
a
silly
creature
!
 
<EOS>
O
had
you
but
suffered
me
to
stay
by
myself
above
,
I
should
have
made
myself
ashamed
of
so
culpable
a
behaviour
!
 
<EOS>
But
goodness
added
to
goodness
every
moment
,
and
the
sense
of
my
own
unworthiness
,
quite
overcome
my
spirits
.
  
<EOS>
Now
,
said
the
generous
man
,
will
I
,
though
reluctantly
,
make
a
proposal
to
my
sweet
girl
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
have
been
too
pressing
for
the
day
:
If
another
day
will
still
be
more
obliging
:
If
you
have
fears
you
will
not
then
have
;
you
shall
say
but
the
word
,
and
I
'll
submit
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
my
Pamela
;
for
though
I
have
,
these
three
days
past
,
thought
every
tedious
hour
a
day
,
till
Thursday
comes
,
if
you
earnestly
desire
it
,
I
will
postpone
it
.
<EOS>
Say
,
my
dear
girl
,
freely
say
;
but
accept
not
my
proposal
,
without
great
reason
,
which
yet
I
will
not
ask
for
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
,
said
I
,
I
can
expect
nothing
but
superlative
goodness
,
I
have
been
so
long
used
to
it
from
you
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
a
most
generous
instance
of
it
;
but
I
fear
 
yes
,
I
fear
it
will
be
too
much
the
same
thing
,
<EOS>
some
days
hence
,
when
the
happy
,
yet
,
fool
that
I
am
!
<EOS>
dreaded
time
,
shall
be
equally
near
!
  
<EOS>
Kind
,
lovely
charmer
!
<EOS>
said
he
,
now
do
I
see
you
are
to
be
trusted
with
power
,
from
the
generous
use
you
make
of
it
!
 
<EOS>
Not
one
offensive
word
or
look
,
from
me
,
shall
wound
your
nicest
thoughts
;
but
pray
try
to
subdue
this
over
-
scrupulousness
,
and
unseasonable
timidity
.
 
<EOS>
I
persuade
myself
you
will
if
you
can
.
  
<EOS>
Indeed
,
sir
,
I
will
,
said
I
;
for
I
am
quite
ashamed
of
myself
,
with
all
these
lovely
views
before
me
!
 
<EOS>
The
honours
you
do
me
,
the
kindness
you
shew
me
!
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
forgive
myself
!
 
<EOS>
For
,
oh
!
<EOS>
if
I
know
the
least
of
this
idle
foolish
heart
of
mine
,
it
has
not
a
misgiving
thought
of
your
goodness
;
and
I
should
abhor
it
,
if
it
were
capable
of
the
least
affectation
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
dear
good
sir
,
leave
me
a
little
to
myself
,
and
I
will
take
myself
to
a
severer
task
than
your
goodness
will
let
you
do
<EOS>
and
I
will
present
my
heart
before
you
,
a
worthier
offering
to
you
,
<EOS>
than
at
present
its
wayward
follies
will
let
it
seem
to
be
.
 
<EOS>
But
one
thing
is
,
one
has
no
kind
friend
of
one
's
own
sex
,
to
communicate
one
's
foolish
thoughts
to
,
and
to
be
strengthened
by
their
comfortings
!
 
<EOS>
But
I
am
left
to
myself
;
and
,
oh
!
<EOS>
what
a
weak
silly
thing
I
am
!
  
<EOS>
He
kindly
withdrew
,
to
give
me
time
to
recollect
myself
;
and
in
about
half
an
hour
returned
:
and
then
,
that
he
might
not
begin
at
once
upon
the
subject
,
and
say
,
at
the
same
time
,
something
agreeable
to
me
,
said
,
Your
father
and
mother
have
had
a
great
deal
of
talk
by
this
time
about
you
,
Pamela
.
 
<EOS>
O
,
sir
,
returned
I
,
your
goodness
has
made
them
quite
happy
!
<EOS>
But
I
ca
n't
help
being
concerned
about
Lady
Davers
.
  
<EOS>
He
said
,
I
am
vexed
<EOS>
I
did
not
hear
the
footman
out
;
because
it
runs
in
my
head
he
talked
somewhat
about
her
coming
hither
.
 
<EOS>
She
will
meet
with
but
an
indifferent
reception
from
me
,
unless
she
comes
resolved
to
behave
better
than
she
writes
.
  
<EOS>
Pray
,
sir
,
said
I
,
be
pleased
to
bear
with
my
good
lady
,
for
two
reasons
.
<EOS>
What
are
they
?
<EOS>
said
he
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
first
,
sir
,
answered
I
,
because
she
is
your
sister
;
and
,
to
be
sure
,
may
very
well
think
,
what
all
the
world
will
,
that
you
have
much
undervalued
yourself
in
making
me
happy
.
 
<EOS>
And
next
,
because
,
if
her
ladyship
finds
you
out
of
temper
with
her
,
it
will
still
aggravate
her
more
against
me
;
and
every
time
that
any
warm
words
you
may
have
between
you
,
come
into
her
mind
,
she
will
disdain
me
more
.
  
<EOS>
Do
n't
concern
yourself
about
it
,
said
he
;
for
we
have
more
proud
ladies
than
she
in
our
other
neighbourhood
,
who
,
perhaps
,
have
still
less
reason
to
be
punctilious
about
their
descent
,
and
yet
will
form
themselves
upon
her
example
,
and
say
,
Why
,
his
own
sister
will
not
forgive
him
,
nor
visit
him
!
 
<EOS>
And
so
,
if
I
can
subdue
her
spirit
,
which
is
more
than
her
husband
ever
could
,
or
indeed
any
body
else
,
it
is
a
great
point
gained
:
<EOS>
And
,
if
she
gives
me
reason
,
I
'll
try
for
it
,
I
assure
you
.
  
<EOS>
Well
,
but
,
my
dear
girl
,
continued
he
,
since
the
subject
is
so
important
,
may
I
not
say
one
word
about
to
-
morrow
?
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
said
I
,
I
hope
I
shall
be
less
a
fool
:
I
have
talked
as
harshly
to
my
heart
,
as
Lady
Davers
can
do
;
and
the
naughty
thing
suggests
to
me
a
better
,
and
more
grateful
behaviour
.
  
<EOS>
He
smiled
,
and
,
kissing
me
,
said
,
I
took
notice
,
Pamela
,
of
what
you
observed
,
that
you
have
none
of
your
own
sex
with
you
;
<EOS>
I
think
it
is
a
little
hard
upon
you
;
and
I
should
have
liked
you
should
have
had
Miss
Darnford
;
but
then
her
sister
must
have
been
asked
;
and
I
might
as
well
make
a
public
wedding
:
which
,
you
know
,
would
have
required
clothes
and
other
preparations
.
 
<EOS>
Besides
,
added
he
,
a
foolish
proposal
was
once
made
me
of
that
second
sister
,
who
has
two
or
three
thousand
pounds
more
than
the
other
,
left
her
by
a
godmother
,
and
she
ca
n't
help
being
a
little
piqued
<EOS>
;
though
,
said
he
,
it
was
a
proposal
they
could
not
expect
should
succeed
;
for
there
is
nothing
in
her
person
nor
mind
;
and
her
fortune
,
as
that
must
have
been
the
only
inducement
,
would
not
do
by
any
means
;
and
so
I
discouraged
it
at
once
.
  
<EOS>
I
am
thinking
,
sir
,
said
I
,
of
another
mortifying
thing
too
;
that
were
you
to
marry
a
lady
of
birth
and
fortune
answerable
to
your
own
,
all
the
eve
to
the
day
would
be
taken
up
in
reading
,
signing
,
and
sealing
of
settlements
,
and
portion
,
and
such
like
:
<EOS>
But
now
the
poor
Pamela
brings
you
nothing
at
all
:
<EOS>
And
the
very
clothes
she
wears
,
so
very
low
is
she
,
are
entirely
the
effects
of
your
bounty
,
and
that
of
your
good
mother
<EOS>
:
This
makes
me
a
little
sad
:
<EOS>
For
,
alas
!
<EOS>
sir
,
I
am
so
much
oppressed
by
your
favours
,
and
the
sense
of
the
obligations
I
lie
under
,
that
I
can
not
look
up
with
the
confidence
that
I
otherwise
should
,
on
this
awful
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
There
is
,
my
dear
Pamela
,
said
he
,
where
the
power
is
wanting
,
as
much
generosity
in
the
will
as
in
the
action
.
 
<EOS>
To
all
that
know
your
story
,
and
your
merit
,
it
will
appear
that
I
can
not
recompense
you
for
what
I
have
made
you
suffer
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
had
too
many
hard
struggles
and
exercises
;
and
have
nobly
overcome
:
and
who
shall
grudge
you
the
reward
of
the
hard
-
bought
victory
?
 
<EOS>
This
affair
is
so
much
the
act
of
my
own
will
,
that
I
glory
in
being
capable
of
distinguishing
so
much
excellence
;
and
my
fortune
is
the
more
pleasurable
to
me
,
as
it
gives
me
hope
,
that
I
may
make
you
some
part
of
satisfaction
for
what
you
have
undergone
.
  
<EOS>
This
,
sir
,
said
I
,
is
all
goodness
,
unmerited
on
my
side
;
and
makes
my
obligations
the
greater
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
only
wish
for
more
worthiness
.
 
<EOS>
But
how
poor
is
it
to
offer
nothing
but
words
for
such
generous
deeds
!
 
<EOS>
And
to
say
,
I
wish
!
 
<EOS>
For
what
is
a
wish
,
but
the
acknowledged
want
of
power
to
oblige
,
and
a
demonstration
of
one
's
poverty
in
every
thing
but
will
?
  
<EOS>
And
that
,
my
dear
girl
,
said
he
,
is
every
thing
:
'
<EOS>
Tis
all
I
want
:
'
<EOS>
Tis
all
that
Heaven
itself
requires
of
us
:
<EOS>
But
no
more
of
these
little
doubts
,
though
they
are
the
natural
impulses
of
a
generous
and
grateful
heart
:
I
want
not
to
be
employed
in
settlements
.
 
<EOS>
Those
are
for
such
to
regard
,
who
make
convenience
and
fortune
the
prime
considerations
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
possessions
ample
enough
for
us
both
;
and
you
deserve
to
share
them
with
me
;
and
you
shall
do
it
,
with
as
little
reserve
,
as
if
you
had
brought
me
what
the
world
reckons
an
equivalent
:
<EOS>
for
,
as
to
my
own
opinion
,
you
bring
me
what
is
infinitely
more
valuable
,
an
experienced
truth
,
a
well
-
tried
virtue
,
and
a
wit
and
behaviour
more
than
equal
to
the
station
you
will
be
placed
in
:
<EOS>
To
say
nothing
of
this
sweet
person
,
that
itself
might
captivate
a
monarch
;
and
of
the
meekness
of
temper
,
and
sweetness
of
disposition
,
which
make
you
superior
to
all
the
women
I
ever
saw
.
  
<EOS>
Thus
kind
and
soothing
,
and
honourably
affectionate
,
was
the
dear
gentleman
,
to
the
unworthy
,
doubting
,
yet
assured
Pamela
;
and
thus
patiently
did
he
indulge
,
and
generously
pardon
,
my
impertinent
weakness
.
<EOS>
He
offered
to
go
himself
to
Lady
Jones
,
in
the
morning
,
and
reveal
the
matter
to
her
,
and
desire
her
secrecy
and
presence
;
but
I
said
,
That
would
disoblige
the
young
Ladies
Darnford
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
sir
,
said
I
,
I
will
cast
myself
upon
your
generous
kindness
;
for
why
should
I
fear
the
kind
protector
of
my
weakness
,
and
the
guide
and
director
of
my
future
steps
?
  
<EOS>
You
can
not
,
said
he
,
forgive
Mrs.
Jewkes
;
for
she
must
know
it
;
and
suffer
her
to
be
with
you
?
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
sir
,
said
I
,
I
can
.
 
<EOS>
She
is
very
civil
to
me
now
:
and
her
former
wickedness
I
will
forgive
,
for
the
sake
of
the
happy
fruits
that
have
attended
it
;
and
because
you
mention
her
.
  
<EOS>
Well
,
said
he
,
I
will
call
her
in
,
if
you
please
.
 
<EOS>
As
you
please
,
sir
,
said
I.
 
<EOS>
And
he
rung
for
her
;
and
when
she
came
in
,
he
said
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
I
am
going
to
entrust
you
with
a
secret
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
answered
she
,
I
will
be
sure
to
keep
it
as
such
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
said
he
<EOS>
,
we
intend
to
-
morrow
,
privately
as
possible
,
for
our
wedding
-
day
;
and
Mr.
Peters
and
Mr.
Williams
are
to
be
here
,
as
to
breakfast
with
me
,
and
to
shew
Mr.
Peters
my
little
chapel
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
the
ceremony
is
over
,
we
will
take
a
little
airing
in
the
chariot
,
as
we
have
done
at
other
times
;
and
so
it
will
not
be
wondered
that
we
are
dressed
.
 
<EOS>
And
the
two
parsons
have
promised
secrecy
,
and
will
go
home
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
you
ca
n't
well
avoid
letting
one
of
the
maids
into
the
secret
;
but
that
I
'll
leave
to
you
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
,
replied
she
<EOS>
,
we
all
concluded
it
would
be
in
a
few
days
!
<EOS>
and
I
doubt
it
wo
n't
be
long
a
secret
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
said
he
,
I
do
n't
desire
it
should
;
but
you
know
we
are
not
provided
for
a
public
wedding
,
and
I
shall
declare
it
when
we
go
to
Bedfordshire
,
which
wo
n't
be
long
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
men
,
who
lie
in
the
outhouses
,
need
not
know
it
;
for
,
by
some
means
or
other
,
my
sister
Davers
knows
all
that
passes
.
  
<EOS>
Do
you
know
,
sir
,
said
she
,
that
her
ladyship
intends
to
be
down
here
with
you
in
a
few
days
?
 
<EOS>
Her
servant
told
me
so
,
who
brought
you
the
letter
you
were
angry
at
.
  
<EOS>
I
hope
,
said
he
,
we
shall
be
set
out
for
t'other
house
first
;
and
shall
be
pleased
she
loses
her
labour
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
continued
she
,
her
ladyship
,
proposes
to
be
here
time
enough
to
hinder
your
nuptials
,
which
she
takes
,
as
we
did
,
will
be
the
latter
end
of
next
week
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
said
he
,
let
her
come
:
<EOS>
but
yet
I
desire
not
to
see
her
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
said
to
me
,
Give
me
leave
,
madam
,
to
wish
you
all
manner
of
happiness
:
<EOS>
But
I
am
afraid
I
have
too
well
obeyed
his
honour
,
to
be
forgiven
by
you
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
returned
I
,
you
will
be
more
your
own
enemy
than
I
will
be
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
look
all
forward
:
and
shall
not
presume
,
so
much
as
by
a
whisper
,
to
set
my
good
master
against
any
one
he
pleases
to
approve
of
:
<EOS>
And
as
to
his
old
servants
,
I
shall
always
value
them
,
and
never
offer
to
dictate
to
his
choice
,
or
influence
it
by
my
own
caprices
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
said
my
master
,
you
find
you
have
no
cause
to
apprehend
any
thing
.
 
<EOS>
My
Pamela
is
very
placable
;
and
as
we
have
both
been
sinners
together
,
we
must
both
be
included
in
one
act
of
grace
.
  
<EOS>
Such
an
example
of
condescension
,
as
I
have
before
me
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
said
I
,
may
make
you
very
easy
;
for
I
must
be
highly
unworthy
,
if
I
did
not
forego
all
my
little
resentments
,
if
I
had
any
,
for
the
sake
of
so
much
goodness
to
myself
.
  
<EOS>
You
are
very
kind
,
madam
,
said
she
;
and
you
may
depend
upon
it
,
I
will
atone
for
all
my
faults
,
by
my
future
duty
and
respect
to
you
,
as
well
as
to
my
master
.
  
<EOS>
That
's
well
said
on
both
sides
,
said
he
:
<EOS>
but
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
to
assure
you
,
that
my
good
girl
here
has
no
malice
,
she
chooses
you
to
attend
her
in
the
morning
at
the
ceremony
,
and
you
must
keep
up
her
spirits
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
,
replied
she
,
be
very
proud
of
the
honour
:
<EOS>
But
I
can
not
,
madam
,
but
wonder
to
see
you
so
very
low
-
spirited
,
as
you
have
been
these
two
or
three
days
past
,
with
so
much
happiness
before
you
.
  
<EOS>
Why
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
answered
I
,
there
can
be
but
one
reason
given
;
and
that
is
,
that
I
am
a
sad
fool
!
 
<EOS>
But
,
indeed
,
I
am
not
ungrateful
neither
;
nor
would
I
put
on
a
foolish
affectation
:
<EOS>
But
my
heart
,
at
times
,
sinks
within
me
;
I
know
not
why
,
except
at
my
own
unworthiness
,
and
because
the
honour
done
me
is
too
high
for
me
to
support
myself
under
,
as
I
should
do
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
an
honour
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
added
I
,
<EOS>
I
was
not
born
to
;
and
no
wonder
,
then
,
I
behave
so
awkwardly
.
 
<EOS>
She
made
me
a
fine
compliment
upon
it
,
and
withdrew
,
repeating
her
promises
of
care
,
secrecy
,
etc
.
  
<EOS>
He
parted
from
me
with
very
great
tenderness
;
and
I
came
up
and
set
to
writing
,
to
amuse
my
thoughts
,
and
wrote
thus
far
.
 
<EOS>
And
Mrs.
Jewkes
being
come
up
,
and
<EOS>
it
being
past
twelve
,
I
will
go
to
bed
;
but
not
one
wink
<EOS>
,
I
fear
,
shall
I
get
this
night
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
beat
myself
for
anger
.
 
<EOS>
Sure
there
is
nothing
ominous
in
this
strange
folly
!
 
<EOS>
But
I
suppose
all
young
maidens
are
the
same
,
so
near
so
great
a
change
of
condition
,
though
they
carry
it
off
more
discreetly
than
I.
  
<EOS>
Thursday
,
six
o'clock
in
the
morning
.
  
<EOS>
I
might
as
well
have
not
gone
to
bed
last
night
,
for
what
sleep
I
had
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
often
was
talking
to
me
,
and
said
several
things
that
would
have
been
well
enough
from
any
body
else
of
our
sex
;
but
the
poor
woman
has
so
little
purity
of
heart
,
that
it
is
all
say
from
her
,
and
goes
no
farther
than
the
ear
.
  
<EOS>
I
fancy
my
master
has
not
slept
much
neither
;
for
I
heard
him
up
,
and
walking
about
his
chamber
,
ever
since
break
of
day
.
 
<EOS>
To
be
sure
,
good
gentleman
!
<EOS>
he
must
have
some
concern
,
as
well
as
I
;
for
here
he
is
going
to
marry
a
poor
foolish
unworthy
girl
,
brought
up
on
the
charity
,
as
one
may
say
,
(
at
least
bounty
,
)
of
his
worthy
family
!
 
<EOS>
And
this
foolish
girl
must
be
,
to
all
intents
and
purposes
,
after
twelve
o'clock
this
day
,
as
much
his
wife
,
as
if
he
were
to
marry
a
duchess
!
 
<EOS>
And
here
he
must
stand
the
shocks
of
common
reflection
!
 
<EOS>
The
great
Mr.
B
#
#
#
#
has
done
finely
!
<EOS>
he
has
married
his
poor
servant
wench
!
<EOS>
will
some
say
.
 
<EOS>
The
ridicule
and
rude
jests
of
his
equals
,
and
companions
too
<EOS>
,
he
must
stand
:
<EOS>
And
the
disdain
of
his
relations
,
and
indignation
of
Lady
Davers
,
his
lofty
sister
!
 
<EOS>
Dear
good
gentleman
!
<EOS>
he
will
have
enough
to
do
,
to
be
sure
!
 
<EOS>
O
how
shall
I
merit
all
these
things
at
his
hand
!
 
<EOS>
I
can
only
do
the
best
I
can
;
and
pray
to
God
to
reward
him
;
and
resolve
to
love
him
with
a
pure
heart
,
and
serve
him
with
a
sincere
obedience
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
the
dear
gentleman
will
continue
to
love
me
for
this
;
for
,
alas
!
<EOS>
I
have
nothing
else
to
offer
!
<EOS>
But
,
as
I
can
hardly
expect
so
great
a
blessing
,
if
I
can
be
secure
from
his
contempt
,
I
shall
not
be
unfortunate
;
and
must
bear
his
indifference
,
if
his
rich
friends
should
inspire
him
with
it
,
and
proceed
with
doing
my
duty
with
cheerfulness
.
  
<EOS>
Half
an
hour
past
eight
o'clock
.
  
<EOS>
My
good
dear
master
,
my
kind
friend
,
my
generous
benefactor
,
my
worthy
protector
,
and
,
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
all
the
good
words
in
one
,
my
affectionate
husband
,
that
is
soon
to
be
(
be
curbed
in
,
my
proud
heart
,
know
thy
self
,
and
be
conscious
of
thy
unworthiness
!
)
 
<EOS>
has
just
left
me
,
with
the
kindest
,
tenderest
expressions
,
and
gentlest
behaviour
,
that
ever
blest
a
happy
maiden
.
 
<EOS>
He
approached
me
with
a
sort
of
reined
-
in
rapture
.
 
<EOS>
My
Pamela
!
<EOS>
said
he
,
<EOS>
May
I
just
ask
after
your
employment
?
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
let
me
chide
my
dear
girl
this
day
,
however
.
 
<EOS>
The
two
parsons
will
be
here
to
breakfast
with
us
at
nine
;
and
yet
you
are
not
a
bit
dressed
!
 
<EOS>
Why
this
absence
of
mind
,
and
sweet
irresolution
?
  
<EOS>
Why
,
indeed
,
sir
,
said
I
,
I
will
set
about
a
reformation
this
instant
.
<EOS>
He
saw
the
common
-
prayer
book
lying
in
the
window
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
,
said
he
,
my
lovely
maiden
has
been
conning
the
lesson
she
is
by
-
and
-
by
to
repeat
.
<EOS>
Have
you
not
,
Pamela
?
<EOS>
and
clasped
his
arms
about
me
,
and
kissed
me
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
sir
,
said
I
,
I
have
been
reading
over
the
solemn
service
.
 
<EOS>
And
what
thinks
my
fairest
<EOS>
(
for
so
he
called
me
)
of
it
?
 
<EOS>
O
sir
,
'
tis
very
awful
,
and
makes
one
shudder
,
to
reflect
upon
it
!
 
<EOS>
No
wonder
,
said
he
,
it
should
affect
my
sweet
Pamela
<EOS>
:
I
have
been
looking
into
it
this
morning
,
and
I
ca
n't
say
<EOS>
but
I
think
it
a
solemn
,
but
very
suitable
service
.
 
<EOS>
But
this
I
tell
my
dear
love
,
continued
he
,
and
again
clasped
me
to
him
<EOS>
,
there
is
not
a
tittle
in
it
that
I
can
not
joyfully
subscribe
to
:
<EOS>
And
that
,
my
dear
Pamela
,
should
make
you
easy
,
and
join
cheerfully
in
it
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
kissed
his
dear
hand
:
<EOS>
O
my
generous
,
kind
protector
<EOS>
,
said
I
,
how
gracious
is
it
to
confirm
thus
the
doubting
mind
of
your
poor
servant
!
<EOS>
which
apprehends
nothing
so
much
as
her
own
unworthiness
of
the
honour
and
blessing
that
await
her
!
 
<EOS>
He
was
pleased
to
say
,
I
know
well
,
<EOS>
my
dearest
creature
,
that
,
according
to
the
liberties
we
people
of
fortune
generally
give
ourselves
,
I
have
promised
a
great
deal
,
when
I
say
so
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
would
not
have
said
it
,
if
,
deliberately
,
I
could
not
with
all
my
heart
.
 
<EOS>
So
banish
from
your
mind
all
doubt
and
uneasiness
;
let
a
generous
confidence
in
me
take
place
;
and
let
me
see
it
does
,
by
your
cheerfulness
in
this
day
's
solemn
business
;
and
then
I
will
love
you
for
ever
!
  
<EOS>
May
God
Almighty
,
sir
,
said
I
,
reward
all
your
goodness
to
me
!
 
<EOS>
That
is
all
I
can
say
.
 
<EOS>
But
<EOS>
,
oh
!
<EOS>
how
kind
it
is
in
you
,
to
supply
the
want
of
the
presence
and
comfortings
of
a
dear
mother
,
of
a
loving
sister
,
or
of
the
kind
companions
of
my
own
sex
,
which
most
maidens
have
,
to
soothe
their
anxieties
on
the
so
near
approach
of
so
awful
a
solemnity
!
 
<EOS>
You
,
sir
,
are
all
these
tender
relations
in
one
to
me
!
 
<EOS>
Your
condescensions
and
kindness
shall
,
if
possible
,
embolden
me
to
look
up
to
you
without
that
sweet
terror
,
that
must
confound
poor
bashful
maidens
,
on
such
an
occasion
,
when
they
are
surrendered
up
to
a
more
doubtful
happiness
,
and
to
half
-
strange
men
,
whose
good
faith
,
and
good
usage
of
them
,
must
be
less
experienced
,
and
is
all
involved
in
the
dark
bosom
of
futurity
,
and
only
to
be
proved
by
the
event
.
  
<EOS>
This
,
my
dear
Pamela
,
said
he
,
is
most
kindly
said
!
 
<EOS>
It
shews
me
that
you
enter
gratefully
into
my
intention
.
 
<EOS>
For
I
would
,
by
my
conduct
,
supply
all
these
dear
relations
to
you
;
and
I
voluntarily
promise
,
from
my
heart
,
to
you
,
what
I
think
I
could
not
,
with
such
assured
resolutions
of
performance
,
to
the
highest
-
born
lady
in
the
kingdom
.
 
<EOS>
For
let
me
tell
my
sweet
girl
,
that
,
after
having
been
long
tossed
by
the
boisterous
winds
of
a
more
culpable
passion
,
I
have
now
conquered
it
,
and
am
not
so
much
the
victim
of
your
beauty
,
all
charming
as
you
are
,
as
of
your
virtue
;
and
therefore
may
more
boldly
promise
for
myself
,
having
so
stable
a
foundation
for
my
affection
;
which
,
should
this
outward
beauty
fail
,
will
increase
with
your
virtue
,
and
shine
forth
the
brighter
,
as
that
is
more
illustriously
displayed
by
the
augmented
opportunities
which
the
condition
you
are
now
entering
into
will
afford
you
.
 
<EOS>
O
the
dear
charming
man
!
<EOS>
how
nobly
,
how
encouragingly
kind
,
was
all
this
!
  
<EOS>
I
could
not
suitably
express
myself
:
<EOS>
And
he
said
,
<EOS>
I
see
my
girl
is
at
a
loss
for
words
!
 
<EOS>
I
doubt
not
your
kind
acceptance
of
my
declarations
.
<EOS>
And
when
I
have
acted
too
much
the
part
of
a
libertine
formerly
,
for
you
to
look
back
without
some
anxiety
,
I
ought
not
,
being
now
happily
convicted
,
to
say
less
.
 
<EOS>
But
why
loses
my
girl
her
time
?
 
<EOS>
I
will
now
only
add
,
that
I
hope
for
many
happy
years
to
make
good
,
by
my
conduct
,
what
so
willingly
flows
from
my
lips
.
  
<EOS>
He
kissed
me
again
,
and
said
,
<EOS>
But
,
whatever
you
do
,
Pamela
,
be
cheerful
;
for
else
,
may
be
,
of
the
small
company
we
shall
have
,
some
one
,
not
knowing
how
to
account
for
your
too
nice
modesty
,
will
think
there
is
some
other
person
in
the
world
,
whose
addresses
would
be
still
more
agreeable
to
you
.
  
<EOS>
This
he
said
with
an
air
of
sweetness
and
pleasantry
;
but
it
alarmed
me
exceedingly
,
and
made
me
resolve
to
appear
as
calm
and
cheerful
as
possible
.
 
<EOS>
For
this
was
,
indeed
,
a
most
affecting
expression
,
and
enough
to
make
me
,
if
any
thing
can
,
behave
as
I
ought
,
and
to
force
my
idle
fears
to
give
way
to
hopes
so
much
better
grounded
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
began
almost
,
on
this
occasion
,
to
wish
Mr.
Williams
were
not
to
marry
me
,
lest
I
should
behave
like
a
fool
;
and
so
be
liable
to
an
imputation
,
which
I
should
be
most
unworthy
,
if
I
deserved
.
  
<EOS>
So
I
set
about
dressing
me
instantly
;
and
he
sent
Mrs.
Jewkes
to
assist
me
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
am
never
long
a
dressing
,
when
I
set
about
it
;
and
my
master
has
now
given
me
a
hint
,
that
will
,
for
half
an
hour
more
,
at
least
,
keep
my
spirits
in
a
brisk
circulation
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
it
concerns
me
a
little
too
,
lest
he
should
have
any
the
least
shadow
of
a
doubt
,
that
I
am
not
,
mind
and
person
,
entirely
his
.
  
<EOS>
And
so
being
now
ready
,
and
not
called
to
breakfast
,
I
sat
down
and
wrote
thus
far
.
  
<EOS>
I
might
have
mentioned
,
that
I
dressed
myself
in
a
rich
white
satin
night
-
gown
,
<EOS>
that
had
been
my
good
lady
's
,
and
my
best
head
-
clothes
,
etc
.
<EOS>
I
have
got
such
a
knack
of
writing
,
that
when
I
am
by
myself
,
I
can
not
sit
without
a
pen
in
my
hand
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
am
now
called
to
breakfast
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
the
gentlemen
are
come
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
courage
,
Pamela
!
 
<EOS>
Remember
thou
art
upon
thy
good
behaviour
!
 
<EOS>
Fie
upon
it
!
<EOS>
my
heart
begins
to
flutter
again
!
  
<EOS>
F
oolish
heart
!
<EOS>
be
still
!
 
<EOS>
Never
,
sure
,
was
any
maiden
's
perverse
heart
under
so
little
command
as
mine
!
 
<EOS>
It
gave
itself
away
,
at
first
,
without
my
leave
;
it
has
been
,
for
weeks
,
pressing
me
with
its
wishes
;
and
yet
now
,
when
it
should
be
happy
itself
,
and
make
me
<EOS>
so
,
it
is
throb
,
throb
,
throb
,
like
a
little
fool
!
<EOS>
and
filling
me
with
such
unseasonable
misgivings
,
as
abate
the
rising
comforts
of
all
my
better
prospects
.
  
<EOS>
Thursday
,
near
three
o'clock
.
  
<EOS>
I
thought
I
should
have
found
no
time
nor
heart
to
write
again
this
day
.
<EOS>
But
here
are
three
gentlemen
come
,
unexpectedly
,
to
dine
with
my
master
;
and
so
I
shall
not
appear
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
done
all
he
could
,
civilly
,
to
send
them
away
;
but
they
will
stay
,
though
I
believe
he
had
rather
they
would
not
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
I
have
nothing
to
do
but
<EOS>
to
write
till
I
go
to
dinner
myself
with
Mrs.
Jewkes
:
for
my
master
was
not
prepared
for
this
company
;
and
it
will
be
a
little
latish
to
-
day
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
will
begin
with
my
happy
story
where
I
left
off
.
  
<EOS>
When
I
came
down
to
breakfast
,
Mr.
Peters
and
Mr.
Williams
were
both
there
.
 
<EOS>
And
as
soon
as
my
master
heard
me
coming
down
,
he
met
me
at
the
door
,
and
led
me
in
with
great
tenderness
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
kindly
spoken
to
them
,
as
he
told
me
afterwards
,
to
mention
no
more
of
the
matter
to
me
,
than
needs
must
.
 
<EOS>
I
paid
my
respects
to
them
,
I
believe
a
little
awkwardly
,
and
was
almost
out
of
breath
:
but
said
,
I
had
come
down
a
little
too
fast
.
  
<EOS>
When
Abraham
came
in
to
wait
,
my
master
said
,
(
that
the
servants
should
not
mistrust
,
)
'
<EOS>
Tis
<EOS>
well
,
gentlemen
,
you
came
as
you
did
;
for
my
good
girl
<EOS>
and
I
were
going
to
take
an
airing
till
dinner
-
time
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
you
'll
stay
and
dine
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
said
Mr.
Peters
,
we
wo
n't
hinder
your
airing
.
 
<EOS>
I
only
came
,
having
a
little
time
upon
my
hands
,
to
see
your
chapel
;
but
must
be
at
home
at
dinner
;
and
Mr.
Williams
will
dine
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
Well
then
,
said
my
master
,
we
will
pursue
our
intention
,
and
ride
out
for
an
hour
or
two
,
as
soon
as
I
have
shewn
Mr.
Peters
my
little
chapel
.
 
<EOS>
Will
you
,
Pamela
,
after
breakfast
,
walk
with
us
to
it
?
 
<EOS>
If
,
if
,
said
I
,
and
had
like
to
have
stammered
,
foolish
that
I
was
!
<EOS>
if
you
please
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
look
none
of
them
in
the
face
.
 
<EOS>
Abraham
looking
at
me
;
Why
,
child
,
said
my
master
,
you
have
hardly
recovered
your
fright
yet
<EOS>
:
how
came
your
foot
to
slip
?
 
<EOS>
'
<EOS>
Tis
<EOS>
well
you
did
not
hurt
yourself
.
<EOS>
Said
Mr.
Peters
,
improving
the
hint
,
You
ha'n't
sprained
your
ancle
,
madam
,
I
hope
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
sir
,
said
I
,
I
believe
not
;
but
'
tis
a
little
painful
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
it
was
;
for
I
meant
my
foolishness
!
 
<EOS>
Abraham
,
said
my
master
,
bid
Robin
put
the
horses
to
the
coach
,
instead
of
the
chariot
;
and
if
these
gentlemen
will
go
,
we
can
set
them
down
.
 
<EOS>
No
matter
,
sir
,
said
Mr.
Peters
:
I
had
as
lieve
walk
,
if
Mr.
Williams
chooses
it
.
 
<EOS>
Well
then
,
said
my
master
,
let
it
be
the
chariot
,
as
I
told
him
.
  
<EOS>
I
could
eat
nothing
,
though
I
attempted
it
;
and
my
hand
shook
so
<EOS>
,
I
spilled
some
of
my
chocolate
,
and
so
put
it
down
again
;
and
they
were
all
very
good
,
and
looked
another
way
.
 
<EOS>
My
master
said
,
when
Abraham
was
out
,
I
have
a
quite
plain
ring
here
,
<EOS>
Mr.
Peters
:
<EOS>
And
I
hope
the
ceremony
will
dignify
the
ring
;
and
that
I
shall
give
my
girl
reason
to
think
it
,
for
that
cause
,
the
most
valuable
one
that
can
be
presented
her
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Peters
said
,
He
was
sure
I
should
value
it
more
than
the
richest
diamond
in
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
I
had
bid
Mrs.
Jewkes
not
to
dress
herself
,
lest
she
should
give
cause
of
mistrust
;
and
she
took
my
advice
.
  
<EOS>
When
breakfast
was
over
,
my
master
said
,
before
Abraham
,
Well
,
<EOS>
gentlemen
,
we
will
step
into
the
chapel
;
and
you
must
give
me
your
advice
,
as
to
the
alterations
I
design
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
in
the
more
haste
,
because
the
survey
you
are
going
to
take
of
it
,
for
the
alterations
,
will
take
up
a
little
time
;
and
we
shall
have
but
a
small
space
between
that
and
dinner
,
for
the
little
tour
<EOS>
I
design
to
make
.
 
<EOS>
Pamela
,
you
'll
give
us
your
opinion
,
wo
n't
you
?
<EOS>
Yes
,
sir
,
said
I
;
I
'll
come
after
you
.
  
<EOS>
So
they
went
out
,
and
I
sat
down
in
the
chair
again
,
and
fanned
myself
:
<EOS>
I
am
sick
at
heart
,
said
I
,
I
think
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
.
 
<EOS>
Said
she
<EOS>
,
Shall
I
fetch
you
a
little
cordial
?
 
<EOS>
No
,
said
I
,
I
am
a
sad
fool
!
 
<EOS>
I
want
spirits
,
that
's
all
.
 
<EOS>
She
took
her
smelling
-
bottle
,
and
would
have
given
it
me
:
<EOS>
but
I
said
,
Keep
it
in
your
hand
;
may
be
I
shall
want
it
:
<EOS>
but
I
hope
not
.
  
<EOS>
She
gave
me
very
good
words
,
and
begged
me
to
go
:
<EOS>
And
I
got
up
;
but
my
knees
beat
so
against
one
another
<EOS>
,
I
was
forced
to
sit
down
again
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
at
last
,
I
held
by
her
arm
,
and
passing
by
Abraham
<EOS>
,
I
said
,
This
ugly
slip
,
coming
down
stairs
,
has
made
me
limp
,
though
;
so
I
must
hold
by
you
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
know
what
alterations
there
are
to
be
in
the
chapel
,
that
we
must
all
give
our
opinions
of
them
?
  
<EOS>
Nan
,
she
told
me
,
was
let
into
the
secret
;
and
she
had
ordered
her
to
stay
at
the
chapel
door
,
to
see
that
nobody
came
in
.
 
<EOS>
My
dear
master
came
to
me
,
at
entering
the
chapel
,
and
took
my
hand
,
and
led
me
up
to
the
altar
.
 
<EOS>
Remember
,
my
dear
girl
,
whispered
he
,
and
be
cheerful
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
,
<EOS>
I
will
,
sir
,
said
I
;
but
I
hardly
knew
what
I
said
;
and
so
you
may
believe
,
when
I
said
to
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
Do
n't
leave
me
;
pray
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
do
n't
leave
me
;
as
if
I
had
all
confidence
in
her
,
and
none
where
it
was
most
due
.
 
<EOS>
So
she
kept
close
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
God
forgive
me
!
<EOS>
but
I
never
was
so
absent
in
my
life
,
as
at
first
;
even
till
Mr.
Williams
had
gone
on
in
the
service
,
so
far
as
to
the
awful
words
about
requiring
us
,
as
we
should
answer
at
the
dreadful
day
of
judgment
;
and
then
the
solemn
words
,
and
my
master
's
whispering
<EOS>
,
Mind
this
,
my
dear
,
made
me
start
.
 
<EOS>
Said
he
,
still
whispering
<EOS>
,
Know
you
any
impediment
?
 
<EOS>
I
blushed
,
and
said
softly
,
None
,
sir
,
but
my
great
unworthiness
.
  
<EOS>
Then
followed
the
sweet
words
,
Wilt
thou
have
this
woman
to
thy
wedded
wife
?
<EOS>
etc
.
<EOS>
and
I
began
to
take
heart
a
little
,
when
my
dearest
master
answered
,
audibly
,
to
this
question
,
I
will
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
could
only
make
a
courtesy
,
when
they
asked
me
;
though
,
I
am
sure
,
my
heart
was
readier
than
my
speech
,
and
answered
to
every
article
of
obey
,
serve
,
love
,
and
honour
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Peters
gave
me
away
;
and
I
said
,
after
Mr.
Williams
,
as
well
as
I
could
,
as
my
dear
master
did
with
a
much
better
grace
,
the
words
of
betrothment
;
and
the
ceremony
of
the
ring
passing
next
,
I
received
the
dear
favour
at
his
worthy
hands
with
a
most
grateful
heart
;
and
he
was
pleased
to
say
afterwards
in
the
chariot
,
<EOS>
that
when
he
had
done
saying
,
With
this
ring
I
thee
we
d
,
etc
.
<EOS>
I
made
a
courtesy
,
and
said
,
Thank
you
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
May
be
<EOS>
I
did
;
for
I
am
sure
it
was
a
most
grateful
part
of
the
service
,
and
my
heart
was
overwhelmed
with
his
goodness
,
and
the
tender
grace
wherewith
he
performed
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
very
glad
,
that
the
next
part
was
the
prayer
,
and
kneeling
;
for
I
trembled
so
,
I
could
hardly
stand
,
betwixt
fear
and
joy
.
  
<EOS>
The
joining
of
our
hands
afterwards
,
the
declaration
of
our
being
married
to
the
few
witnesses
present
;
for
,
reckoning
Nan
,
whose
curiosity
would
not
let
her
stay
at
the
door
,
there
were
but
Mr.
Peters
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
and
she
;
the
blessing
,
the
psalm
,
and
the
subsequent
prayers
,
and
the
concluding
exhortation
;
were
so
many
beautiful
,
welcome
,
and
lovely
parts
of
this
divine
office
,
that
my
heart
began
to
be
delighted
with
them
;
and
my
spirits
to
be
a
little
freer
.
  
<EOS>
And
thus
,
my
dearest
,
dear
parents
,
is
your
happy
,
happy
,
thrice
happy
Pamela
,
at
last
married
;
and
to
whom
?
 
<EOS>
Why
,
to
her
beloved
,
gracious
master
!
<EOS>
the
lord
of
her
wishes
!
 
<EOS>
And
thus
the
dear
,
once
naughty
assailer
of
her
innocence
,
by
a
blessed
turn
of
Providence
<EOS>
,
is
become
the
kind
,
the
generous
protector
and
rewarder
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
God
be
evermore
blessed
and
praised
!
<EOS>
and
make
me
not
wholly
unworthy
of
such
a
transcendent
honour
!
  
<EOS>
And
bless
and
reward
the
dear
,
dear
,
good
gentleman
,
who
has
thus
exalted
his
unworthy
servant
,
and
given
her
a
place
,
which
the
greatest
ladies
would
think
themselves
happy
in
!
  
<EOS>
My
master
saluted
me
most
ardently
,
and
said
,
God
give
you
,
my
dear
love
,
as
much
joy
on
this
occasion
,
as
I
have
!
 
<EOS>
And
he
presented
me
to
Mr.
Peters
,
who
saluted
me
;
and
said
,
You
may
excuse
me
,
dear
madam
,
for
I
gave
you
away
,
and
you
are
my
daughter
.
 
<EOS>
And
Mr.
Williams
modestly
withdrawing
a
little
way
;
Mr.
Williams
,
said
my
master
,
pray
accept
my
thanks
,
and
wish
your
sister
joy
.
 
<EOS>
So
he
saluted
me
too
;
and
said
,
Most
heartily
,
madam
,
I
do
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
will
say
,
that
to
see
so
much
innocence
and
virtue
so
eminently
rewarded
,
is
one
of
the
greatest
pleasures
I
have
ever
known
.
 
<EOS>
This
my
master
took
very
kindly
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
would
have
kissed
my
hand
at
the
chapel
-
door
;
but
I
put
my
arms
about
her
neck
,
for
I
had
got
a
new
recruit
of
spirits
just
then
;
and
kissed
her
,
and
said
,
Thank
you
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
for
accompanying
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
behaved
sadly
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
madam
,
said
she
,
pretty
well
,
pretty
well
!
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Peters
walked
out
with
me
;
and
Mr.
Williams
and
my
master
came
out
after
us
,
talking
together
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Peters
,
when
we
came
into
the
parlour
,
said
,
I
once
more
,
madam
,
must
wish
you
joy
on
this
happy
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
every
day
may
add
to
your
comforts
;
and
may
you
very
long
rejoice
in
one
another
!
<EOS>
for
you
are
the
loveliest
couple
I
ever
saw
joined
.
 
<EOS>
I
told
him
,
I
was
highly
obliged
to
his
kind
opinion
,
and
good
wishes
;
and
hoped
my
future
conduct
would
not
make
me
unworthy
of
them
.
  
<EOS>
My
good
benefactor
came
in
with
Mr.
Williams
:
<EOS>
So
,
my
dear
life
,
said
he
,
how
do
you
do
?
 
<EOS>
A
little
more
composed
,
I
hope
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
you
see
this
is
not
so
dreadful
an
affair
as
you
apprehended
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
,
said
Mr.
Peters
,
very
kindly
,
it
is
a
very
solemn
circumstance
;
and
I
love
to
see
it
so
reverently
and
awfully
entered
upon
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
a
most
excellent
sign
;
for
the
most
thoughtful
beginnings
make
the
most
prudent
proceedings
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
of
her
own
accord
,
came
in
with
a
large
silver
tumbler
,
filled
with
sack
,
and
a
toast
,
and
nutmeg
,
and
sugar
;
and
my
master
said
,
That
's
well
thought
of
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
;
for
we
have
made
but
sorry
breakfasting
.
 
<EOS>
And
he
would
make
me
,
take
some
of
the
toast
;
as
they
all
did
,
and
drank
pretty
heartily
:
and
I
drank
a
little
,
and
it
cheered
my
heart
,
I
thought
,
for
an
hour
after
.
  
<EOS>
My
master
took
a
fine
diamond
ring
from
his
finger
,
and
presented
it
to
Mr.
Peters
,
who
received
it
very
kindly
.
 
<EOS>
And
to
Mr.
Williams
he
said
,
<EOS>
My
old
acquaintance
,
I
have
reserved
for
you
,
against
a
variety
of
solicitations
,
the
living
I
always
designed
for
you
;
and
I
beg
you
'll
prepare
to
take
possession
of
it
;
and
as
the
doing
it
may
be
attended
with
some
expense
,
pray
accept
of
this
towards
it
;
and
so
he
gave
him
(
<EOS>
as
he
told
me
afterwards
it
was
)
<EOS>
a
bank
note
of
50l
.
  
<EOS>
So
did
this
generous
good
gentleman
bless
us
all
,
and
me
in
particular
;
for
whose
sake
he
was
as
bounteous
as
if
he
had
married
one
of
the
noblest
fortunes
.
  
<EOS>
So
he
took
his
leave
of
the
gentlemen
,
recommending
secrecy
again
,
for
a
few
days
,
and
they
left
him
;
and
none
of
the
servants
suspected
any
thing
,
as
Mrs.
Jewkes
believes
.
 
<EOS>
And
then
I
threw
myself
at
his
feet
,
blessed
God
,
and
blessed
him
for
his
goodness
;
and
he
overwhelmed
me
with
kindness
,
calling
me
his
sweet
bride
,
and
twenty
lovely
epithets
<EOS>
,
that
swell
my
grateful
heart
beyond
the
power
of
utterance
.
  
<EOS>
He
afterwards
led
me
to
the
chariot
;
and
we
took
a
delightful
tour
round
the
neighbouring
villages
;
and
he
did
all
he
could
to
dissipate
those
still
perverse
anxieties
that
dwell
upon
my
mind
,
and
,
do
what
I
can
,
spread
too
thoughtful
an
air
,
as
he
tells
me
,
over
my
countenance
.
  
<EOS>
We
came
home
again
by
half
an
hour
after
one
;
and
he
was
pleasing
himself
with
thinking
,
not
to
be
an
hour
out
of
my
company
this
blessed
day
,
that
(
as
he
was
so
good
as
to
say
)
he
might
inspire
me
with
a
familiarity
that
should
improve
my
confidence
in
him
,
when
he
was
told
,
that
a
footman
of
Sir
Charles
Hargrave
had
been
here
,
to
let
him
know
,
that
his
master
,
and
two
other
gentlemen
,
were
on
the
road
to
take
a
dinner
with
him
,
in
their
way
to
Nottingham
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
heartily
vexed
at
this
,
and
said
to
me
,
He
should
have
been
glad
of
their
companies
at
any
other
time
;
but
that
it
was
a
barbarous
intrusion
now
;
and
he
wished
they
had
been
told
he
would
not
be
at
home
at
dinner
:
And
besides
,
said
he
,
they
are
horrid
drinkers
;
and
I
sha
n't
be
able
to
get
them
away
to
-
night
,
perhaps
;
for
they
have
nothing
to
do
,
but
to
travel
round
the
country
,
and
beat
up
their
friends
'
quarters
all
the
way
;
and
it
is
all
one
to
them
,
whether
they
stay
a
night
or
a
month
at
a
place
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
added
he
,
I
'll
find
some
way
,
if
I
can
,
to
turn
them
off
,
after
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
Confound
them
,
said
he
,
in
a
violent
pet
,
that
they
should
come
this
day
,
of
all
the
days
in
the
year
!
  
<EOS>
We
had
hardly
alighted
,
and
got
in
,
before
they
came
:
Three
mad
rakes
they
seemed
to
be
,
as
I
looked
through
the
window
,
setting
up
a
hunting
note
,
as
soon
as
they
came
to
the
gate
,
that
made
the
court
-
yard
echo
again
;
and
smacking
their
whips
in
concert
.
  
<EOS>
So
I
went
up
to
my
chamber
,
and
saw
(
what
made
my
heart
throb
)
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
's
officious
pains
to
put
the
room
in
order
for
a
guest
,
that
,
however
welcome
,
as
now
my
duty
teaches
me
to
say
,
is
yet
dreadful
to
me
to
think
of
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
took
refuge
in
my
closet
,
and
had
recourse
to
pen
and
ink
,
for
my
amusement
,
and
to
divert
my
anxiety
of
mind
.
 
<EOS>
If
one
's
heart
is
so
sad
,
and
one
's
apprehension
so
great
,
where
one
so
extremely
loves
,
and
is
so
extremely
obliged
;
what
must
be
the
case
of
those
poor
maidens
,
who
are
forced
,
for
sordid
views
,
by
their
tyrannical
parents
or
guardians
,
to
marry
the
man
they
almost
hate
,
and
,
perhaps
,
to
the
loss
of
the
man
they
most
love
!
 
<EOS>
O
that
is
a
sad
thing
,
indeed
!
 
<EOS>
And
what
have
not
such
cruel
parents
to
answer
for
!
 
<EOS>
And
what
do
not
such
poor
innocent
victims
suffer
!
 
<EOS>
But
,
blessed
be
God
,
this
lot
is
far
from
being
mine
!
  
<EOS>
My
good
master
(
for
I
can
not
yet
have
the
presumption
to
call
him
by
a
more
tender
name
)
came
up
to
me
,
and
said
,
Well
,
I
just
come
to
ask
my
dear
bride
(
O
the
charming
,
charming
word
!
)
<EOS>
how
she
does
?
 
<EOS>
I
see
you
are
writing
,
my
dear
,
said
he
.
 
<EOS>
These
confounded
rakes
are
half
mad
,
I
think
,
and
will
make
me
so
!
 
<EOS>
However
,
said
he
,
I
have
ordered
my
chariot
to
be
got
ready
,
as
if
I
was
under
an
engagement
five
miles
off
,
and
will
set
them
out
of
the
house
,
if
possible
;
and
then
ride
round
,
and
come
back
,
as
soon
as
I
can
get
rid
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
find
,
said
he
,
Lady
Davers
is
full
of
our
affairs
.
 
<EOS>
She
has
taken
great
freedoms
with
me
before
Sir
Charles
;
and
they
have
all
been
at
me
,
without
mercy
;
and
I
was
forced
to
be
very
serious
with
them
,
or
else
they
would
have
come
up
to
have
seen
you
,
since
I
would
not
call
you
down
.
 
<EOS>
He
kissed
me
,
and
said
,
I
shall
quarrel
with
them
,
if
I
ca
n't
get
them
away
;
for
I
have
lost
two
or
three
precious
hours
with
my
soul
's
delight
:
<EOS>
And
so
he
went
down
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
asked
me
to
walk
down
to
dinner
in
the
little
parlour
.
 
<EOS>
I
went
down
,
and
she
was
so
complaisant
as
to
offer
to
wait
upon
me
at
table
;
and
would
not
be
persuaded
,
without
difficulty
,
to
sit
down
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
insisted
she
should
:
For
,
said
I
,
it
would
be
very
extraordinary
,
if
one
should
so
soon
go
into
such
distance
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
.
  
<EOS>
W
hatever
<EOS>
my
new
station
may
require
of
me
,
added
I
,
<EOS>
I
hope
I
shall
always
conduct
myself
in
such
a
manner
,
that
pride
and
insolence
shall
bear
no
part
in
my
character
.
  
<EOS>
You
are
very
good
,
madam
,
said
she
;
but
I
will
always
know
my
duty
to
my
master
's
lady
.
 
<EOS>
Why
then
,
replied
I
,
if
I
must
take
state
upon
me
so
early
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
let
me
exact
from
you
what
you
call
your
duty
;
and
sit
down
with
me
when
I
desire
you
.
  
<EOS>
This
prevailed
upon
her
;
and
I
made
shift
to
get
down
a
bit
of
apple
-
pye
,
and
a
little
custard
;
but
that
was
all
.
  
<EOS>
My
good
master
came
in
again
,
and
said
,
Well
,
thank
my
stars
!
<EOS>
these
rakes
are
going
now
;
but
I
must
set
out
with
them
,
and
I
choose
my
chariot
;
for
if
I
took
horse
,
I
should
have
difficulty
to
part
with
them
;
for
they
are
like
a
snowball
,
and
intend
to
gather
company
as
they
go
,
to
make
a
merry
tour
of
it
for
some
days
together
.
  
<EOS>
We
both
got
up
,
when
he
came
in
:
Fie
,
Pamela
!
<EOS>
said
he
;
why
this
ceremony
now
?
 
<EOS>
Sit
still
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
.
 
<EOS>
Nay
,
sir
,
said
she
,
I
was
loath
to
sit
down
;
but
my
lady
would
have
me
.
 
<EOS>
She
is
very
right
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
said
my
master
,
and
tapped
me
on
the
cheek
;
for
we
are
but
yet
half
married
;
and
so
she
is
not
above
half
your
lady
yet
!
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
look
so
down
,
do
n't
be
so
silent
,
my
dearest
,
said
he
;
why
,
you
hardly
spoke
twenty
words
to
me
all
the
time
we
were
out
together
.
 
<EOS>
Something
I
will
allow
for
your
bashful
sweetness
;
but
not
too
much
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
have
you
no
pleasant
tales
to
tell
my
Pamela
,
to
make
her
smile
,
till
I
return
?
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
sir
,
said
she
,
I
could
tell
twenty
pleasant
stories
;
but
my
lady
is
too
nice
to
hear
them
;
and
yet
,
I
hope
,
<EOS>
I
should
not
be
shocking
neither
.
 
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
poor
woman
!
<EOS>
thought
I
<EOS>
;
thy
chastest
stories
will
make
a
modest
person
blush
,
if
I
know
thee
!
<EOS>
and
I
desire
to
hear
none
of
them
.
  
<EOS>
My
master
said
,
Tell
her
one
of
the
shortest
you
have
,
in
my
hearing
.
<EOS>
Why
,
sir
,
said
she
,
I
knew
a
bashful
young
lady
,
as
madam
may
be
,
married
to
 
Dear
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
interrupted
I
,
no
more
of
your
story
<EOS>
,
I
beseech
you
;
I
do
n't
like
the
beginning
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
Go
on
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
said
my
master
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
pray
,
sir
,
do
n't
require
it
,
said
I
,
pray
do
n't
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
said
he
,
then
we
'll
have
it
another
time
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
.
  
<EOS>
Abraham
coming
in
to
tell
him
the
gentlemen
were
going
,
and
that
his
chariot
was
ready
;
I
am
glad
of
that
,
said
he
;
and
went
to
them
,
and
set
out
with
them
.
  
<EOS>
I
took
a
turn
in
the
garden
with
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
after
they
were
gone
:
And
having
walked
a
while
,
I
said
,
I
should
be
glad
of
her
company
down
the
elm
-
walk
,
to
meet
the
chariot
:
<EOS>
For
,
O
!
<EOS>
I
know
not
how
to
look
up
at
him
,
when
he
is
with
me
;
nor
how
to
bear
his
absence
,
when
I
have
reason
to
expect
him
:
What
a
strange
contradiction
there
is
in
this
unaccountable
passion
.
  
<EOS>
What
a
different
aspect
every
thing
in
and
about
this
house
bears
now
,
to
my
thinking
,
to
what
it
once
had
!
 
<EOS>
The
garden
,
the
pond
,
the
alcove
,
the
elm
-
walk
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
oh
!
<EOS>
my
prison
is
become
my
palace
;
and
no
wonder
every
thing
wears
another
face
!
  
<EOS>
We
sat
down
upon
the
broad
stile
,
leading
towards
the
road
;
and
Mrs.
Jewkes
was
quite
another
person
to
me
,
to
what
she
was
the
last
time
I
sat
there
.
  
<EOS>
At
last
my
best
beloved
returned
,
and
alighted
there
.
 
<EOS>
What
,
my
Pamela
!
<EOS>
(
and
Mrs.
Jewkes
then
left
me
,
)
<EOS>
What
(
said
he
,
and
kissed
me
)
brings
you
this
way
?
 
<EOS>
I
hope
to
meet
me
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
sir
,
said
<EOS>
I.
 
That
's
kind
,
indeed
,
said
he
;
but
why
that
averted
eye
?
 
<EOS>
that
downcast
countenance
,
as
if
you
was
afraid
of
me
?
 
<EOS>
You
must
not
think
so
,
sir
,
said
I.
 
Revive
my
heart
then
,
said
he
,
with
a
more
cheerful
aspect
;
and
let
that
over
-
anxious
solicitude
,
which
appears
in
the
most
charming
face
in
the
world
,
be
chased
from
it
.
 
<EOS>
Have
you
,
my
dear
girl
any
fears
that
I
can
dissipate
;
<EOS>
any
doubts
that
I
can
obviate
;
any
hopes
that
I
can
encourage
;
any
request
that
I
can
gratify
?
 
<EOS>
Speak
,
my
dear
Pamela
;
and
if
I
have
power
,
but
speak
,
and
to
purchase
one
smile
,
it
shall
be
done
!
  
<EOS>
I
can
not
,
sir
,
said
I
,
have
any
fears
,
any
doubts
,
but
that
I
shall
never
be
able
to
deserve
all
your
goodness
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
hopes
,
but
that
my
future
conduct
may
be
agreeable
to
you
,
and
my
determined
duty
well
accepted
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
have
I
any
request
to
make
,
but
that
you
will
forgive
all
my
imperfections
and
,
among
the
rest
,
this
foolish
weakness
,
that
makes
me
seem
to
you
,
after
all
the
generous
things
that
have
passed
,
to
want
this
further
condescension
,
and
these
kind
assurances
.
 
<EOS>
But
indeed
,
sir
,
I
am
oppressed
by
your
bounty
;
my
spirits
sink
under
the
weight
of
it
;
and
the
oppression
is
still
the
greater
,
as
I
see
not
how
,
possibly
,
in
my
whole
future
life
,
by
all
I
can
do
,
to
merit
the
least
of
your
favours
.
  
<EOS>
I
know
your
grateful
heart
,
said
he
;
but
remember
,
my
dear
,
what
the
lawyers
tell
us
,
That
marriage
is
the
highest
consideration
which
the
law
knows
.
 
<EOS>
And
this
,
my
sweet
bride
,
has
made
you
mine
,
and
me
yours
;
and
you
have
the
best
claim
in
the
world
to
share
my
fortune
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
set
that
consideration
aside
,
what
is
the
obligation
you
have
to
me
?
<EOS>
Your
mind
is
pure
as
that
of
an
angel
,
and
as
much
transcends
mine
.
 
<EOS>
Your
wit
,
and
your
judgment
,
to
make
you
no
compliment
,
are
more
than
equal
to
mine
:
You
have
all
the
graces
that
education
can
give
a
woman
,
improved
by
a
genius
which
makes
those
graces
natural
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
a
sweetness
of
temper
,
and
a
noble
sincerity
,
beyond
all
comparison
;
and
in
the
beauty
of
your
person
,
you
excel
all
the
ladies
I
ever
saw
.
 
<EOS>
Where
then
,
my
dearest
,
is
the
obligation
,
if
not
on
my
side
to
you
?
 
<EOS>
But
,
to
avoid
these
comparisons
,
let
us
talk
of
nothing
henceforth
but
equality
;
although
,
if
the
riches
of
your
mind
,
and
your
unblemished
virtue
,
be
set
against
my
fortune
,
(
which
is
but
an
accidental
good
,
as
I
may
call
it
,
and
all
I
have
to
boast
of
,
)
the
condescension
will
be
yours
;
and
I
shall
not
think
I
can
possibly
deserve
you
,
till
,
after
your
sweet
example
,
my
future
life
shall
become
nearly
as
blameless
as
yours
.
  
<EOS>
O
,
sir
,
said
I
,
what
comfort
do
you
give
me
,
<EOS>
that
,
instead
of
my
being
in
danger
of
being
ensnared
by
the
high
condition
to
which
your
goodness
has
exalted
me
,
you
make
me
hope
,
that
I
shall
be
confirmed
and
approved
by
you
;
and
that
we
may
have
a
prospect
of
perpetuating
each
other
's
happiness
,
till
time
shall
be
no
more
!
 
<EOS>
But
,
sir
,
I
will
not
,
as
you
once
cautioned
me
,
be
too
serious
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
resolve
,
with
these
sweet
encouragements
,
to
be
,
in
every
thing
,
what
you
would
have
me
be
:
<EOS>
And
I
hope
I
shall
,
more
and
more
,
shew
you
that
I
have
no
will
but
yours
.
 
<EOS>
He
kissed
me
very
tenderly
,
and
thanked
me
for
this
kind
assurance
,
as
he
called
it
.
  
<EOS>
And
so
we
entered
the
house
together
.
  
<EOS>
Eight
o'clock
at
night
.
  
<EOS>
Now
these
sweet
assurances
,
my
dear
father
and
mother
,
you
will
say
,
must
be
very
consolatory
to
me
;
and
being
voluntary
on
his
side
,
were
all
that
could
be
wished
for
on
mine
;
and
I
was
resolved
,
if
possible
,
to
subdue
my
idle
fears
and
apprehensions
.
  
<EOS>
Ten
o'clock
at
night
.
  
<EOS>
As
we
sat
at
supper
,
he
was
generously
kind
to
me
,
as
well
in
his
actions
,
as
expressions
.
 
<EOS>
He
took
notice
,
in
the
most
delicate
manner
,
of
my
endeavour
to
conquer
my
foibles
;
and
said
,
I
see
,
with
pleasure
,
my
dear
girl
strives
to
comport
herself
in
a
manner
suitable
to
my
wishes
:
I
see
,
even
through
the
sweet
tender
struggles
of
your
over
-
nice
modesty
,
how
much
I
owe
to
your
intentions
of
obliging
me
.
 
<EOS>
As
I
have
once
told
you
,
that
I
am
the
conquest
more
of
your
virtue
than
your
beauty
;
so
not
one
alarming
word
or
look
<EOS>
shall
my
beloved
Pamela
hear
or
see
,
to
give
her
reason
to
suspect
the
truth
of
what
I
aver
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
the
rather
believe
me
,
continued
he
,
as
you
may
see
the
pain
I
have
to
behold
any
thing
that
concerns
you
,
even
though
your
concern
be
causeless
.
 
<EOS>
And
yet
I
will
indulge
my
dear
girl
's
bashful
weakness
so
far
,
as
to
own
,
that
so
pure
a
mind
may
suffer
from
apprehension
,
on
so
important
a
change
as
this
;
and
I
can
therefore
be
only
displeased
with
such
part
of
your
conduct
,
as
may
make
your
sufferings
greater
than
my
own
;
when
I
am
resolved
,
through
every
stage
of
my
future
life
,
in
all
events
,
to
study
to
make
them
less
.
  
<EOS>
After
supper
,
of
which
,
with
all
his
sweet
persuasions
,
I
could
hardly
taste
,
he
made
me
drink
two
glasses
of
champaign
,
and
,
afterwards
,
a
glass
of
sack
;
which
he
kindly
forced
upon
me
,
by
naming
your
healths
:
and
as
the
time
of
retiring
drew
on
,
he
took
notice
,
but
in
a
very
delicate
manner
,
how
my
colour
went
and
came
,
and
how
foolishly
I
trembled
.
 
<EOS>
Nobody
,
surely
,
in
such
delightful
circumstances
,
ever
behaved
so
silly
!
 
<EOS>
And
he
said
,
My
dearest
girl
,
I
fear
you
have
had
too
much
of
my
company
for
so
many
hours
together
;
and
would
better
recollect
yourself
,
if
you
retired
for
half
an
hour
to
your
closet
.
  
<EOS>
I
wished
for
this
,
but
durst
not
say
so
much
,
lest
he
should
be
angry
;
for
,
as
the
hours
grew
on
,
I
found
my
apprehensions
increase
,
and
my
silly
heart
was
the
unquieter
,
every
time
I
could
lift
up
my
eyes
to
his
dear
face
;
so
sweetly
terrible
<EOS>
did
he
appear
to
my
apprehensions
.
 
<EOS>
I
said
,
You
are
all
goodness
,
dear
sir
;
<EOS>
and
I
boldly
kissed
his
dear
hand
,
and
pressed
it
to
my
lips
with
both
mine
.
 
<EOS>
And
saluting
me
very
fervently
,
he
gave
me
his
hand
,
seeing
me
hardly
able
to
stand
,
and
led
me
to
my
chamber
-
door
,
and
then
most
generously
withdrew
.
  
<EOS>
I
went
to
my
closet
;
and
the
first
thing
I
did
,
on
my
knees
,
again
thanked
God
for
the
blessing
of
the
day
;
and
besought
his
divine
goodness
to
conduct
my
future
life
in
such
a
manner
,
as
should
make
me
a
happy
instrument
of
his
glory
.
 
<EOS>
After
this
,
being
now
left
to
my
own
recollection
,
I
grew
a
little
more
assured
and
lightsome
;
and
the
pen
and
paper
being
before
me
,
I
amused
myself
with
writing
thus
far
.
  
<EOS>
Eleven
o'clock
Thursday
night
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
being
come
up
with
a
message
,
desiring
to
know
,
whether
her
master
may
attend
upon
me
in
my
closet
;
and
hinting
to
me
,
that
,
however
,
she
believed
he
did
not
expect
to
find
me
there
;
I
have
sent
word
,
that
I
beg
he
would
indulge
me
one
quarter
of
an
hour
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
committing
myself
to
the
mercies
of
the
Almighty
,
who
has
led
me
through
so
many
strange
scenes
of
terror
and
affrightment
,
to
this
happy
,
yet
awful
moment
,
I
will
wish
you
,
my
dear
parents
,
a
good
night
;
and
though
you
will
not
see
this
in
time
,
yet
<EOS>
I
know
I
have
your
hourly
prayers
,
and
therefore
can
not
fail
of
them
now
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
good
night
,
good
night
!
 
<EOS>
God
bless
you
,
and
God
bless
me
!
 
<EOS>
Amen
,
amen
,
if
it
be
his
blessed
will
,
subscribes
                                            
<EOS>
Your
ever
-
dutiful
DAUGHTER
!
  
<EOS>
Friday
evening
.
  
<EOS>
O
how
this
dear
excellent
man
indulges
me
in
every
thing
!
 
<EOS>
Every
hour
he
makes
me
happier
,
by
his
sweet
condescension
,
than
the
former
.
 
<EOS>
He
pities
my
weakness
of
mind
,
allows
for
all
my
little
foibles
,
endeavours
to
dissipate
my
fears
;
his
words
are
so
pure
,
his
ideas
so
chaste
,
and
his
whole
behaviour
so
sweetly
decent
,
that
never
,
surely
,
was
so
happy
a
creature
as
your
Pamela
!
 
<EOS>
I
never
could
have
hoped
such
a
husband
could
have
fallen
to
my
lot
:
and
much
less
,
that
a
gentleman
,
who
had
allowed
himself
in
attempts
,
that
now
I
will
endeavour
to
forget
for
ever
,
should
have
behaved
with
so
very
delicate
and
unexceptionable
a
demeanour
.
 
<EOS>
No
light
frothy
jests
drop
from
his
lips
;
no
alarming
railleries
;
no
offensive
expressions
,
nor
insulting
airs
,
reproach
or
wound
the
ears
of
your
happy
,
thrice
happy
daughter
.
 
<EOS>
In
short
,
he
says
every
thing
that
may
embolden
me
to
look
up
,
with
pleasure
,
upon
the
generous
author
of
my
happiness
.
  
<EOS>
At
breakfast
,
when
I
knew
not
how
to
see
him
,
he
emboldened
me
by
talking
of
you
,
my
dear
parents
;
a
subject
,
he
generously
knew
,
I
could
talk
of
:
and
gave
me
assurances
,
that
he
would
make
you
both
happy
.
 
<EOS>
He
said
,
He
would
have
me
send
you
a
letter
to
acquaint
you
with
my
nuptials
;
and
,
as
he
could
make
business
that
way
,
Thomas
should
carry
it
purposely
,
as
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
Nor
will
I
,
said
he
,
my
dear
Pamela
,
desire
to
see
your
writings
,
because
I
told
you
I
would
not
;
for
now
I
will
,
in
every
thing
,
religiously
keep
my
word
with
my
dear
spouse
:
(
O
the
dear
delightful
word
!
)
<EOS>
and
you
may
send
all
your
papers
to
them
,
from
those
they
have
,
down
to
this
happy
moment
;
only
let
me
beg
they
will
preserve
them
,
and
let
me
have
them
when
they
have
read
them
;
as
also
those
I
have
not
seen
;
which
,
however
,
I
desire
not
to
see
till
then
;
but
then
shall
take
it
for
a
favour
,
if
you
will
grant
it
.
  
<EOS>
It
will
be
my
pleasure
,
as
well
as
my
duty
,
sir
,
said
I
,
to
obey
you
in
every
thing
:
and
I
will
write
up
to
the
conclusion
of
this
day
,
that
they
may
see
how
happy
you
have
made
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
know
you
will
both
join
with
me
to
bless
God
for
his
wonderful
mercies
and
goodness
to
you
,
as
well
as
to
me
:
For
he
was
pleased
to
ask
me
particularly
after
your
circumstances
,
and
said
,
He
had
taken
notice
,
that
I
had
hinted
,
in
some
of
my
first
letters
,
that
you
owed
money
in
the
world
;
and
he
gave
me
fifty
guineas
,
and
bid
me
send
them
to
you
in
my
packet
,
to
pay
your
debts
,
as
far
as
they
would
go
;
and
that
you
would
quit
your
present
business
,
and
put
yourself
,
and
my
dear
mother
,
into
a
creditable
appearance
;
and
he
would
find
a
better
place
of
abode
for
you
than
that
you
had
,
when
he
returned
to
Bedfordshire
.
 
<EOS>
O
how
shall
I
bear
all
these
exceeding
great
and
generous
favours
!
 
<EOS>
I
send
them
wrapt
up
,
five
guineas
in
a
parcel
,
in
double
papers
.
  
<EOS>
To
me
he
gave
no
less
than
one
hundred
guineas
more
;
and
said
,
I
would
have
you
,
my
dear
,
give
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
when
you
go
away
from
hence
<EOS>
,
what
you
think
fit
out
of
these
,
as
from
yourself
.
 
<EOS>
Nay
,
good
dear
sir
,
said
I
,
let
that
be
what
you
please
.
 
<EOS>
Give
her
,
then
,
said
he
,
twenty
guineas
,
as
a
compliment
on
your
nuptials
.
 
<EOS>
Give
Colbrand
ten
guineas
give
:
the
two
coachmen
five
guineas
each
;
<EOS>
to
the
two
maids
at
this
house
five
guineas
each
;
give
Abraham
five
guineas
;
give
Thomas
five
guineas
;
and
give
the
gardeners
,
grooms
,
and
helpers
,
twenty
guineas
among
them
.
 
<EOS>
And
when
,
said
he
,
I
return
with
you
to
the
other
house
,
I
will
make
you
a
suitable
present
,
to
buy
you
such
ornaments
as
are
fit
for
my
beloved
wife
to
appear
in
.
 
<EOS>
For
now
,
my
Pamela
,
continued
he
,
you
are
not
to
mind
,
as
you
once
proposed
,
what
other
ladies
will
say
;
but
to
appear
as
my
wife
ought
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
Else
it
would
look
as
if
what
you
thought
of
,
as
a
means
to
avoid
the
envy
of
others
of
your
sex
,
was
a
wilful
slight
in
me
,
which
,
I
hope
,
I
never
shall
be
guilty
of
;
and
I
will
shew
the
world
,
that
I
value
you
as
I
ought
,
and
as
if
I
had
married
the
first
fortune
in
the
kingdom
:
<EOS>
And
why
should
it
not
be
so
,
when
I
know
none
of
the
first
quality
that
matches
you
in
excellence
?
  
<EOS>
He
saw
I
was
at
a
loss
for
words
,
and
said
,
I
see
,
my
dearest
bride
!
<EOS>
my
spouse
!
<EOS>
my
wife
!
<EOS>
my
Pamela
!
<EOS>
your
grateful
confusion
.
 
<EOS>
And
kissing
me
,
as
I
was
going
to
speak
,
I
will
stop
your
dear
mouth
,
said
he
:
<EOS>
You
shall
not
so
much
as
thank
me
;
for
when
I
have
done
ten
times
more
than
this
,
I
shall
but
poorly
express
my
love
for
so
much
beauty
of
mind
,
and
loveliness
of
person
;
which
thus
,
said
he
,
and
clasped
me
to
his
generous
bosom
,
I
can
proudly
now
call
my
own
!
 
<EOS>
O
how
,
my
dear
parents
,
can
I
think
of
any
thing
,
but
redoubled
love
,
joy
,
and
gratitude
!
  
<EOS>
And
thus
generously
did
he
banish
from
my
mind
those
painful
reflections
,
and
bashful
apprehensions
,
<EOS>
that
made
me
dread
to
see
him
for
the
first
time
this
day
,
when
I
was
called
to
attend
him
at
breakfast
;
and
made
me
all
ease
,
composure
,
and
tranquillity
.
  
<EOS>
He
then
,
thinking
I
seemed
somewhat
thoughtful
,
proposed
a
little
turn
in
the
chariot
till
dinner
-
time
:
<EOS>
And
this
was
another
sweet
relief
to
me
;
and
he
diverted
me
with
twenty
agreeable
relations
,
of
what
observations
he
had
made
in
his
travels
;
and
gave
me
the
characters
of
the
ladies
and
gentlemen
in
his
other
neighbourhood
;
telling
me
whose
acquaintance
he
would
have
me
most
cultivate
.
 
<EOS>
And
when
I
mentioned
Lady
Davers
with
apprehension
,
he
said
,
To
be
sure
I
love
my
sister
dearly
,
notwithstanding
her
violent
spirit
;
and
I
know
she
loves
me
;
<EOS>
and
I
can
allow
a
little
for
her
pride
,
because
I
know
what
my
own
so
lately
was
;
and
because
she
knows
not
my
Pamela
,
and
her
excellencies
,
as
I
do
.
 
<EOS>
But
you
must
not
,
my
dear
,
forget
what
belongs
to
your
character
,
as
my
wife
,
nor
meanly
stoop
to
her
;
though
I
know
you
will
choose
,
by
softness
,
to
try
to
move
her
to
a
proper
behaviour
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
shall
be
my
part
to
see
,
that
you
do
not
yield
too
much
.
  
<EOS>
However
,
continued
he
,
as
I
would
not
publicly
declare
my
marriage
here
<EOS>
,
I
hope
she
wo
n't
come
near
us
till
we
are
in
Bedfordshire
;
and
then
,
when
she
knows
we
are
married
,
she
will
keep
away
,
if
she
is
not
willing
to
be
reconciled
;
for
she
dares
not
,
surely
,
come
to
quarrel
with
me
,
when
she
knows
it
is
done
;
for
that
would
have
a
hateful
and
wicked
appearance
,
as
if
she
would
try
to
make
differences
between
man
and
wife
.
 
<EOS>
But
we
will
have
no
more
of
this
subject
,
nor
talk
of
any
thing
,
added
he
,
that
shall
give
concern
to
my
dearest
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
he
changed
the
talk
to
a
more
pleasing
subject
,
and
said
the
kindest
and
most
soothing
things
in
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
When
we
came
home
,
which
was
about
dinner
-
time
,
he
was
the
same
obliging
,
kind
gentleman
;
and
,
in
short
,
is
studious
to
shew
,
on
every
occasion
,
his
generous
affection
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
And
,
after
dinner
,
he
told
me
,
he
had
already
written
to
his
draper
,
in
town
,
to
provide
him
new
liveries
;
and
to
his
late
mother
's
mercer
,
to
send
him
down
patterns
of
the
most
fashionable
silks
,
for
my
choice
.
 
<EOS>
I
told
him
,
I
was
unable
to
express
my
gratitude
for
his
favours
and
generosity
:
<EOS>
And
as
he
knew
best
what
befitted
his
own
rank
and
condition
,
I
would
wholly
remit
myself
to
his
good
pleasure
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
by
all
his
repeated
bounties
to
me
,
of
so
extraordinary
a
nature
,
I
could
not
but
look
forward
with
awe
upon
the
condition
to
which
he
had
exalted
me
;
and
now
I
feared
I
should
hardly
be
able
to
act
up
to
it
in
such
a
manner
as
should
justify
the
choice
he
had
condescended
to
make
:
But
that
,
I
hoped
,
I
should
have
not
only
his
generous
allowance
for
my
imperfections
,
<EOS>
which
I
could
only
assure
him
should
not
be
wilful
ones
,
but
his
kind
instructions
;
and
that
as
often
as
he
observed
any
part
of
my
conduct
such
as
he
could
not
entirely
approve
,
he
would
let
me
know
it
;
and
I
would
think
his
reproofs
of
beginning
faults
the
kindest
and
most
affectionate
things
in
the
world
because
they
would
keep
me
from
committing
greater
;
and
be
a
means
to
continue
to
me
the
blessing
of
his
good
opinion
.
  
<EOS>
He
answered
me
in
the
kindest
manner
;
and
assured
me
,
That
nothing
should
ever
lie
upon
his
mind
which
he
would
not
reveal
,
and
give
me
an
opportunity
either
of
convincing
him
,
or
being
convinced
myself
.
  
<EOS>
He
then
asked
me
,
When
I
should
be
willing
to
go
to
the
Bedfordshire
house
?
 
<EOS>
I
said
,
whenever
he
pleased
.
 
<EOS>
We
will
come
down
hither
again
before
the
winter
,
said
he
,
if
you
please
,
in
order
to
cultivate
the
acquaintance
you
have
begun
with
Lady
Jones
,
and
Sir
Simon
's
family
;
and
,
if
it
please
God
to
spare
us
to
one
another
,
in
the
winter
I
will
give
you
,
as
I
promised
for
two
or
three
months
,
the
diversions
of
London
.
<EOS>
And
I
think
,
added
he
,
<EOS>
if
my
dear
pleases
,
we
will
set
out
next
week
,
about
Tuesday
,
for
t'other
house
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
have
no
objection
,
sir
,
said
I
,
to
any
thing
you
propose
;
but
how
will
you
avoid
Miss
Darnford
's
solicitation
for
an
evening
to
dance
?
 
<EOS>
Why
,
said
he
,
we
can
make
Monday
evening
do
for
that
purpose
,
if
they
wo
n't
excuse
us
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
if
you
please
,
said
he
,
I
will
invite
Lady
Jones
,
Mr.
Peters
and
his
family
,
and
Sir
Simon
and
his
family
,
to
my
little
chapel
,
on
Sunday
morning
,
and
to
stay
dinner
with
me
;
and
then
I
will
declare
my
marriage
to
them
,
because
my
dear
life
shall
not
leave
this
country
with
the
least
reason
for
a
possibility
of
any
body
's
doubting
that
it
is
so
.
 
<EOS>
O
!
<EOS>
how
good
was
this
!
<EOS>
But
,
indeed
,
his
conduct
is
all
of
a
piece
,
noble
,
kind
,
and
considerate
!
<EOS>
What
a
happy
creature
am
I
!
 
<EOS>
And
then
,
may
be
,
said
he
,
they
will
excuse
us
till
we
return
into
this
country
again
,
as
to
the
ball
.
 
<EOS>
Is
there
any
thing
,
added
he
,
that
my
beloved
Pamela
has
still
to
wish
?
 
<EOS>
If
you
have
,
freely
speak
.
  
<EOS>
Hitherto
,
my
dearest
sir
,
replied
I
,
you
have
not
only
prevented
my
wishes
,
but
my
hopes
,
and
even
my
thoughts
.
 
<EOS>
And
yet
I
must
own
,
since
your
kind
command
of
speaking
my
mind
seems
to
shew
,
that
you
expect
from
me
I
should
say
something
;
that
I
have
only
one
or
two
things
to
wish
more
,
and
then
I
shall
be
too
happy
.
 
<EOS>
Say
,
said
he
,
what
they
are
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
proceeded
I
,
I
am
,
indeed
,
ashamed
to
ask
any
thing
,
lest
it
should
not
be
agreeable
to
you
;
and
lest
it
should
look
as
if
I
was
taking
advantage
of
your
kind
condescensions
to
me
,
and
knew
not
when
to
be
satisfied
!
  
<EOS>
I
will
only
tell
you
,
Pamela
,
said
he
,
that
you
are
not
to
imagine
,
that
these
things
,
which
I
have
done
,
in
hopes
of
obliging
you
,
are
the
sudden
impulses
of
a
new
passion
for
you
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
if
I
can
answer
for
my
own
mind
,
they
proceed
from
a
regular
and
uniform
desire
of
obliging
you
:
which
,
I
hope
,
will
last
as
long
as
your
merit
lasts
;
and
that
,
I
make
no
doubt
,
will
be
as
long
as
I
live
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
can
the
rather
answer
for
this
,
because
I
really
find
so
much
delight
in
myself
in
my
present
way
of
thinking
and
acting
,
as
infinitely
overpays
me
;
and
which
,
for
that
reason
,
I
am
likely
to
continue
,
for
both
our
sakes
.
 
<EOS>
My
beloved
wife
,
therefore
,
said
he
,
for
methinks
I
am
grown
fond
of
a
name
I
once
despised
<EOS>
,
may
venture
to
speak
her
mind
;
and
I
will
promise
,
that
,
so
far
as
it
is
agreeable
to
me
,
and
I
cheerfully
can
,
I
will
comply
;
and
you
will
not
insist
upon
it
,
if
that
should
not
be
the
case
.
  
<EOS>
To
be
sure
,
sir
,
said
I
,
I
ought
not
,
neither
will
I.
 
<EOS>
And
now
you
embolden
me
to
become
an
humble
petitioner
,
and
that
,
as
I
ought
,
upon
my
knees
,
for
the
reinstating
such
of
your
servants
,
as
I
have
been
the
unhappy
occasion
of
their
disobliging
you
.
 
<EOS>
He
raised
me
up
,
and
said
,
My
beloved
Pamela
has
too
often
been
in
this
suppliant
posture
to
me
,
to
permit
it
any
more
.
 
<EOS>
Rise
,
my
fairest
,
and
let
me
know
whom
,
in
particular
,
you
would
reinstate
;
and
he
kindly
held
me
in
his
arms
,
and
pressed
me
to
his
beloved
bosom
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jervis
,
sir
,
said
I
,
in
the
first
place
;
for
she
is
a
good
woman
;
and
the
misfortunes
she
has
had
in
the
world
,
must
make
your
displeasure
most
heavy
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
Well
,
said
he
,
who
next
?
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Longman
,
sir
,
said
I
;
and
I
am
sure
,
kind
as
they
have
been
to
me
,
yet
would
I
not
ask
it
,
if
I
could
not
vouch
for
their
integrity
,
and
if
I
did
not
think
it
was
my
dear
master
's
interest
to
have
such
good
servants
.
  
<EOS>
Have
you
any
thing
further
?
<EOS>
said
he
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
said
I
,
your
good
old
butler
,
who
has
so
long
been
in
your
family
before
the
day
of
your
happy
birth
,
I
would
,
if
I
might
,
become
an
advocate
for
!
  
<EOS>
Well
,
said
he
,
I
have
only
to
say
,
That
had
not
Mr.
Longman
and
Mrs.
Jervis
,
and
Jonathan
too
,
joined
in
a
body
,
<EOS>
in
a
bold
appeal
to
Lady
Davers
,
which
has
given
her
the
insolent
handle
she
has
taken
to
intermeddle
in
my
affairs
,
I
could
easily
have
forgiven
all
the
rest
of
their
conduct
;
though
they
have
given
their
tongues
no
little
license
about
me
:
But
I
could
have
forgiven
them
,
because
I
desire
every
body
should
admire
you
;
and
it
is
with
pride
that
I
observe
not
only
their
opinion
and
love
,
but
that
of
every
body
else
that
knows
you
,
justify
my
own
.
 
<EOS>
But
yet
,
I
will
forgive
even
this
,
because
my
Pamela
desires
it
;
and
I
will
send
a
letter
myself
,
to
tell
Longman
what
he
owes
to
your
interposition
,
if
the
estate
he
has
made
in
my
family
does
not
set
him
above
the
acceptance
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
And
,
as
to
Mrs.
Jervis
,
do
you
,
my
dear
,
write
a
letter
to
her
,
and
give
her
your
commands
,
instantly
,
on
,
the
receipt
of
it
,
to
go
and
take
possession
of
her
former
charge
;
for
now
,
my
dearest
girl
,
she
will
be
more
immediately
your
servant
;
and
I
know
you
love
her
so
well
,
that
you
'll
go
thither
with
the
more
pleasure
to
find
her
there
.
 
<EOS>
But
do
n't
think
,
added
he
,
that
all
this
compliance
is
to
be
for
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
Ah
,
sir
!
<EOS>
said
I
,
tell
me
but
what
I
can
do
,
poor
as
I
am
in
power
,
but
rich
in
will
;
and
I
will
not
hesitate
one
moment
.
 
<EOS>
Why
then
,
said
he
,
of
your
own
accord
,
reward
me
for
my
cheerful
compliance
,
with
one
sweet
kiss
 
<EOS>
I
instantly
said
,
Thus
,
then
,
dear
sir
,
will
I
obey
;
<EOS>
and
,
oh
!
<EOS>
you
have
the
sweetest
and
most
generous
way
in
the
world
,
to
make
that
a
condition
,
which
gives
me
double
honour
,
and
adds
to
my
obligations
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
I
clasped
my
arms
about
his
neck
,
and
was
not
ashamed
to
kiss
him
once
and
twice
,
and
three
times
;
once
for
every
forgiven
person
.
  
<EOS>
Now
,
my
dearest
Pamela
,
said
he
,
what
other
things
have
you
to
ask
?
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Williams
is
already
taken
care
of
;
and
,
I
hope
,
will
be
happy
.
 
<EOS>
Have
you
nothing
to
say
for
John
Arnold
?
  
<EOS>
Why
,
dear
sir
,
said
I
,
you
have
seen
the
poor
fellow
's
penitence
in
my
letters
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
my
dear
,
so
I
have
;
but
that
is
his
penitence
for
his
having
served
me
against
you
;
and
,
I
think
,
when
he
would
have
betrayed
me
afterwards
,
he
deserves
nothing
to
be
said
or
done
for
him
by
either
.
  
<EOS>
But
,
dear
sir
,
said
I
,
this
is
a
day
of
jubilee
;
and
the
less
he
deserves
,
poor
fellow
,
the
more
will
be
your
goodness
.
 
<EOS>
And
let
me
add
one
word
;
That
as
he
was
divided
in
his
inclinations
between
his
duty
to
you
and
good
wishes
to
me
,
and
knew
not
how
to
distinguish
between
the
one
and
the
other
,
when
he
finds
us
so
happily
united
by
your
great
goodness
to
me
,
he
will
have
no
more
puzzles
in
his
duty
;
for
he
has
not
failed
in
any
other
part
of
it
;
but
,
I
hope
,
will
serve
you
faithfully
for
the
future
.
  
<EOS>
Well
,
then
,
suppose
I
put
Mrs.
Jewkes
in
a
good
way
of
business
,
in
some
inn
,
and
give
her
John
for
a
husband
?
 
<EOS>
And
then
your
gipsy
story
will
be
made
out
,
that
she
will
have
a
husband
younger
than
herself
.
  
<EOS>
You
are
all
goodness
,
sir
,
said
I.
 
I
can
freely
forgive
poor
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
and
wish
her
happy
.
 
<EOS>
But
permit
me
,
sir
,
to
ask
,
Would
not
this
look
like
a
very
heavy
punishment
to
poor
John
?
<EOS>
and
as
if
you
could
not
forgive
him
,
when
you
are
so
generous
to
every
body
else
?
  
<EOS>
He
smiled
and
said
,
O
my
Pamela
,
this
,
for
a
forgiving
spirit
,
is
very
severe
upon
poor
Jewkes
:
<EOS>
But
I
shall
never
,
by
the
grace
of
God
,
have
any
more
such
trying
services
,
to
put
him
or
the
rest
upon
;
and
if
you
can
forgive
him
,
I
think
I
may
:
<EOS>
and
so
John
shall
be
at
your
disposal
.
 
<EOS>
And
now
let
me
know
what
my
Pamela
has
further
to
wish
?
  
<EOS>
O
,
my
dearest
sir
,
said
I
,
not
a
single
wish
more
has
your
grateful
Pamela
!
 
<EOS>
My
heart
is
overwhelmed
with
your
goodness
!
 
<EOS>
Forgive
these
tears
of
joy
,
added
I
:
<EOS>
You
have
left
me
nothing
to
pray
for
,
but
that
God
will
bless
you
with
life
,
and
health
,
and
honour
,
and
continue
to
me
the
blessing
of
your
esteem
;
and
I
shall
then
be
the
happiest
creature
in
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
He
clasped
me
in
his
arms
,
and
said
,
You
can
not
,
my
dear
life
,
be
so
happy
in
me
,
as
I
am
in
you
.
 
<EOS>
O
how
heartily
I
despise
all
my
former
pursuits
,
and
headstrong
appetites
!
 
<EOS>
What
joys
,
what
true
joys
,
flow
from
virtuous
love
!
<EOS>
joys
which
the
narrow
soul
of
the
libertine
can
not
take
in
,
nor
his
thoughts
conceive
!
 
<EOS>
And
which
I
myself
,
whilst
a
libertine
,
had
not
the
least
notion
of
!
  
<EOS>
But
,
said
he
,
I
expected
my
dear
spouse
,
my
Pamela
,
had
something
to
ask
for
herself
.
 
<EOS>
But
since
all
her
own
good
is
absorbed
in
the
delight
her
generous
heart
takes
in
promoting
that
of
others
,
it
shall
be
my
study
to
prevent
her
wishes
,
and
to
make
her
care
for
herself
unnecessary
,
by
my
anticipating
kindness
.
  
<EOS>
In
this
manner
,
my
dear
parents
,
is
your
happy
daughter
blessed
in
a
husband
!
 
<EOS>
O
how
my
exulting
heart
leaps
at
the
dear
,
dear
word
!
 
<EOS>
And
I
have
nothing
to
do
,
but
to
be
humble
,
and
to
look
up
with
gratitude
to
the
all
-
gracious
dispenser
of
these
blessings
.
  
<EOS>
So
,
with
a
thousand
thanks
,
I
afterwards
retired
to
my
closet
,
to
write
you
thus
far
.
 
<EOS>
And
having
completed
what
I
purpose
for
this
packet
,
and
put
up
the
kind
obliging
present
,
I
have
nothing
more
to
say
,
but
that
I
hope
soon
to
see
you
both
,
and
receive
your
blessings
on
this
happy
,
thrice
happy
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
,
hoping
for
your
prayers
,
that
I
may
preserve
an
humble
and
upright
mind
to
my
gracious
God
,
a
dutiful
gratitude
to
my
dear
master
and
husband
 
that
I
may
long
rejoice
in
the
continuance
of
these
blessings
and
favours
,
and
that
I
may
preserve
,
at
the
same
time
,
an
obliging
deportment
to
every
one
else
,
I
conclude
myself
,
             
Your
ever
-
dutiful
and
most
happy
daughter
,

O
think
it
not
my
pride
,
my
dear
parents
,
that
sets
me
on
glorying
in
my
change
of
name
!
 
<EOS>
Yours
will
be
always
dear
to
me
,
and
what
I
shall
never
be
ashamed
of
<EOS>
,
I
'm
sure
:
<EOS>
But
yet
 
for
such
a
husband
!
 
<EOS>
What
shall
I
say
,
since
words
are
too
faint
to
express
my
gratitude
and
my
joy
!
  
<EOS>
I
have
taken
copies
of
my
master
's
letter
to
Mr.
Longman
,
and
mine
to
Mrs.
Jervis
,
which
I
will
send
with
the
further
occurrences
,
when
I
go
to
the
other
dear
house
,
or
give
you
when
I
see
you
,
as
I
now
hope
soon
to
do
.
  
<EOS>
Saturday
morning
,
the
third
of
my
happy
nuptials
.
  
<EOS>
I
must
still
write
on
,
till
I
come
to
be
settled
in
the
duty
of
the
station
to
which
I
am
so
generously
exalted
,
and
to
let
you
participate
with
me
the
transporting
pleasures
that
rise
from
my
new
condition
,
and
the
favours
that
are
hourly
heaped
upon
me
by
the
best
of
husbands
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
had
got
my
packet
for
you
finished
,
I
then
set
about
writing
,
as
he
had
kindly
directed
me
,
to
Mrs.
Jervis
;
and
had
no
difficulty
till
I
came
to
sign
my
name
;
and
so
I
brought
it
down
with
me
,
when
I
was
called
to
supper
,
unsigned
.
  
<EOS>
My
good
master
(
for
I
delight
,
and
always
shall
,
to
call
him
by
that
name
)
<EOS>
had
been
writing
to
Mr.
Longman
;
and
he
said
,
pleasantly
,
See
,
here
,
my
dearest
,
what
I
have
written
to
your
Somebody
.
 
<EOS>
I
read
as
follows
:
  
"
Mr.
LONGMAN
,
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
the
pleasure
to
acquaint
you
,
that
last
Thursday
I
was
married
to
my
beloved
Pamela
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
had
reason
to
be
disobliged
with
you
,
and
Mrs.
Jervis
and
Jonathan
,
not
for
your
kindness
to
,
and
regard
for
,
my
dear
spouse
,
that
now
is
,
but
for
the
manner
,
in
which
you
appealed
to
my
sister
Davers
;
which
has
made
a
very
wide
breach
between
her
and
me
.
 
<EOS>
But
as
it
was
one
of
her
first
requests
,
that
I
would
overlook
what
had
passed
,
and
reinstate
you
in
all
your
former
charges
,
I
think
myself
obliged
,
without
the
least
hesitation
,
to
comply
with
it
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
if
you
please
,
you
may
enter
again
upon
an
office
which
you
have
always
executed
with
unquestionable
integrity
,
and
to
the
satisfaction
of
   
<EOS>
"
Yours
etc
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Friday
afternoon
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
set
out
next
Tuesday
or
Wednesday
for
Bedfordshire
;
and
desire
to
find
Jonathan
,
as
well
as
you
,
in
your
former
offices
;
in
which
,
I
dare
say
,
you
'll
have
the
more
pleasure
,
as
you
have
such
an
early
instance
of
the
sentiments
of
my
dear
wife
,
from
whose
goodness
you
may
expect
every
agreeable
thing
.
 
<EOS>
She
writes
herself
to
Mrs.
Jervis
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
thanked
him
most
gratefully
for
his
goodness
;
and
afterwards
took
the
above
copy
of
it
;
and
shewed
him
my
letter
to
Mrs.
Jervis
,
as
follows
:
  
"
My
DEAR
MRS
.
JERVIS
,
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
joyful
tidings
to
communicate
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
For
yesterday
I
was
happily
married
to
the
best
of
gentlemen
,
yours
and
my
beloved
master
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
only
now
to
tell
you
,
that
I
am
inexpressibly
happy
:
that
my
generous
benefactor
denies
me
nothing
,
and
even
anticipates
my
wishes
.
<EOS>
You
may
be
sure
I
could
not
forget
my
dear
Mrs.
Jervis
;
and
I
made
it
my
request
,
and
had
it
granted
,
as
soon
as
asked
,
that
you
might
return
to
the
kind
charge
,
which
you
executed
with
so
much
advantage
to
our
master
's
interest
,
and
so
much
pleasure
to
all
under
your
direction
.
 
<EOS>
All
the
power
that
is
put
into
my
hands
,
by
the
most
generous
of
men
,
shall
be
exerted
to
make
every
thing
easy
and
agreeable
to
you
:
<EOS>
And
as
I
shall
soon
have
the
honour
of
attending
my
beloved
to
Bedfordshire
,
it
will
be
a
very
considerable
addition
to
my
delight
,
and
to
my
unspeakable
obligations
to
the
best
of
men
,
to
see
my
dear
Mrs.
Jervis
,
and
to
be
received
by
her
with
that
pleasure
,
which
I
promise
myself
from
her
affection
.
 
<EOS>
For
I
am
,
my
dear
good
friend
,
and
always
will
be
,
                   
<EOS>
"
Yours
,
very
affectionately
,
and
gratefully

<EOS>
He
read
this
letter
,
and
said
,
'
Tis
yours
,
my
dear
,
and
must
be
good
:
But
do
n't
you
put
your
name
to
it
?
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
said
I
,
your
goodness
has
given
me
a
right
to
a
very
honourable
one
<EOS>
but
as
this
is
the
first
occasion
of
the
kind
,
except
that
to
my
dear
father
and
mother
,
I
think
I
ought
to
shew
it
<EOS>
you
unsigned
,
that
I
may
not
seem
over
-
forward
to
take
advantage
of
the
honour
you
have
done
me
.
  
<EOS>
However
sweetly
humble
and
requisite
,
said
he
,
this
may
appear
to
my
dear
Pamela
's
niceness
,
it
befits
me
to
tell
you
,
that
I
am
every
moment
more
and
more
pleased
with
the
right
you
have
to
my
name
:
and
,
<EOS>
my
dear
life
,
added
he
,
<EOS>
I
have
only
to
wish
I
may
be
half
as
worthy
as
you
are
of
the
happy
knot
so
lately
knit
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
took
a
pen
himself
,
and
wrote
,
after
Pamela
,
his
most
worthy
sirname
;
and
I
under
-
wrote
thus
:
"
O
rejoice
with
me
,
my
dear
Mrs.
Jervis
,
that
I
am
enabled
,
by
God
's
graciousness
,
and
my
dear
master
's
goodness
,
thus
to
write
myself
!
"
  
<EOS>
These
letters
,
and
the
packet
to
you
,
were
sent
away
by
Mr.
Thomas
early
this
morning
.
  
<EOS>
My
dearest
master
is
just
gone
to
take
a
ride
out
,
and
intends
to
call
upon
Lady
Jones
,
Mr.
Peters
,
and
Sir
Simon
Darnford
,
to
invite
them
to
chapel
and
dinner
to
-
morrow
;
and
says
,
he
chooses
to
do
it
himself
,
because
the
time
is
so
short
,
they
will
,
perhaps
,
deny
a
servant
.
  
<EOS>
I
forgot
to
mention
,
that
Mr.
Williams
was
here
yesterday
,
to
ask
leave
to
go
to
see
his
new
living
,
and
to
provide
for
taking
possession
of
it
;
and
seemed
so
pleased
with
my
master
's
kindness
and
fondness
for
me
,
as
well
as
his
generous
deportment
to
himself
,
that
he
left
us
in
such
a
disposition
,
as
shewed
he
was
quite
happy
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
very
glad
of
it
;
for
it
would
rejoice
me
to
be
an
humble
means
of
making
all
mankind
so
:
<EOS>
And
oh
!
<EOS>
what
returns
ought
I
not
to
make
to
the
divine
goodness
!
<EOS>
and
how
ought
I
to
strive
to
diffuse
the
blessings
I
experience
,
to
all
in
my
knowledge
!
  
<EOS>
F
or
else
,
what
is
it
for
such
a
worm
as
I
to
be
exalted
!
 
<EOS>
What
is
my
single
happiness
,
if
I
suffer
it
,
niggard
-
like
,
to
extend
no
farther
than
to
myself
?
 
<EOS>
But
then
,
indeed
,
do
God
Almighty
's
creatures
act
worthy
of
the
blessings
they
receive
,
when
they
make
,
or
endeavour
to
make
,
<EOS>
the
whole
creation
,
so
far
as
is
in
the
circle
of
their
power
,
happy
!
  
<EOS>
Great
and
good
God
!
<EOS>
as
thou
hast
enlarged
my
opportunities
,
enlarge
also
my
will
,
and
make
me
delight
in
dispensing
to
others
a
portion
of
that
happiness
,
which
I
have
myself
so
plentifully
received
at
the
hand
of
thy
gracious
Providence
!
 
<EOS>
Then
shall
I
not
be
useless
in
my
generation
!
 
<EOS>
Then
shall
I
not
stand
a
single
mark
of
thy
goodness
to
a
poor
worthless
creature
,
that
in
herself
is
of
so
small
account
in
the
scale
of
beings
,
a
mere
cipher
on
the
wrong
side
of
a
figure
;
but
shall
be
placed
on
the
right
side
;
and
,
though
nothing
worth
in
myself
,
shall
give
signification
by
my
place
,
and
multiply
the
blessings
I
owe
to
thy
goodness
,
which
has
distinguished
me
by
so
fair
a
lot
!
  
<EOS>
This
,
as
I
conceive
,
is
the
indispensable
duty
of
a
high
condition
;
and
how
great
must
be
the
condemnation
of
poor
creatures
,
at
the
great
day
of
account
,
when
they
shall
be
asked
,
What
uses
they
have
made
of
the
opportunities
put
into
their
hands
?
<EOS>
and
are
able
only
to
say
,
We
have
lived
but
to
ourselves
:
<EOS>
We
have
circumscribed
all
the
power
thou
hast
given
us
into
one
narrow
,
selfish
,
compass
:
We
have
heaped
up
treasures
for
those
who
came
after
us
,
though
we
knew
not
whether
they
would
not
make
a
still
worse
use
of
them
than
we
ourselves
did
!
 
<EOS>
And
how
can
such
poor
selfish
pleaders
expect
any
other
sentence
,
than
the
dreadful
,
Depart
,
ye
cursed
!
  
<EOS>
But
sure
,
my
dear
father
and
mother
,
such
persons
can
have
no
notion
of
the
exalted
pleasures
that
flow
from
doing
good
,
were
there
to
be
no
after
-
account
at
all
!
  
<EOS>
There
is
something
so
satisfactory
and
pleasing
to
reflect
on
the
being
able
to
administer
comfort
and
relief
to
those
who
stand
in
need
of
it
,
as
infinitely
,
of
itself
,
rewards
the
beneficent
mind
.
 
<EOS>
And
how
often
have
I
experienced
this
in
my
good
lady
's
time
,
though
<EOS>
but
the
second
-
hand
dispenser
of
her
benefits
to
the
poor
and
sickly
,
when
she
made
me
her
almoner
!
 
<EOS>
How
have
I
been
affected
with
the
blessings
which
the
miserable
have
heaped
upon
her
for
her
goodness
,
and
upon
me
for
being
<EOS>
but
the
humble
conveyer
of
her
bounty
to
them
!
 
<EOS>
And
how
delighted
have
I
been
,
when
the
moving
report
I
have
made
of
a
particular
distress
,
has
augmented
my
good
lady
's
first
intentions
in
relief
of
it
!
  
<EOS>
This
I
recall
with
pleasure
,
because
it
is
now
,
by
the
divine
goodness
,
become
my
part
to
do
those
good
things
she
was
<EOS>
wo
nt
to
do
:
<EOS>
And
oh
!
let
me
watch
myself
,
that
my
prosperous
state
do
not
make
me
forget
to
look
up
,
with
due
thankfulness
,
to
the
Providence
which
has
entrusted
me
with
the
power
,
that
so
I
may
not
incur
a
terrible
woe
by
the
abuse
or
neglect
of
it
!
  
<EOS>
Forgive
me
these
reflections
,
my
dear
parents
;
and
let
me
have
your
prayers
,
that
I
may
not
find
my
present
happiness
a
snare
to
me
;
but
that
I
may
consider
,
that
more
and
more
will
be
expected
from
me
,
in
proportion
to
the
power
given
me
;
and
that
I
may
not
so
unworthily
act
,
as
if
I
believed
I
ought
to
set
up
my
rest
in
my
mean
self
,
and
think
nothing
further
to
be
done
,
with
the
opportunities
put
into
my
hand
,
by
the
divine
favour
,
and
the
best
of
men
!
  
<EOS>
Saturday
,
seven
o'clock
in
the
evening
.
  
<EOS>
My
master
returned
home
to
dinner
,
in
compliment
to
me
,
though
much
pressed
to
dine
with
Lady
Jones
,
as
he
was
,
also
,
by
Sir
Simon
,
to
dine
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
But
Mr.
Peters
could
not
conveniently
provide
a
preacher
for
his
own
church
tomorrow
morning
,
at
so
short
a
notice
;
Mr.
Williams
being
gone
,
as
I
said
,
to
his
new
living
;
but
believed
he
could
for
the
afternoon
;
and
so
he
promised
to
give
us
his
company
to
dinner
,
and
to
read
afternoon
service
:
<EOS>
and
this
made
my
master
invite
all
the
rest
,
as
well
as
him
,
to
dinner
,
and
not
to
church
;
and
he
made
them
promise
to
come
;
and
told
Mr.
Peters
,
he
would
send
his
coach
for
him
and
his
family
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Darnford
told
him
pleasantly
,
She
would
not
come
,
unless
he
would
promise
to
let
her
be
at
his
wedding
;
by
which
I
find
Mr.
Peters
has
kept
the
secret
,
as
my
master
desired
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
pleased
to
give
me
an
airing
after
dinner
in
the
chariot
,
and
renewed
his
kind
assurances
to
me
,
and
,
if
possible
,
is
kinder
than
ever
.
<EOS>
This
is
sweetly
comfortable
to
me
,
because
it
shews
me
he
does
not
repent
of
his
condescensions
to
me
;
and
it
encourages
me
to
look
up
to
him
with
more
satisfaction
of
mind
,
and
less
doubtfulness
.
  
<EOS>
I
begged
leave
to
send
a
guinea
to
a
poor
body
in
the
town
,
that
I
heard
,
by
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
lay
very
ill
,
and
was
very
destitute
.
 
<EOS>
He
said
,
Send
two
,
<EOS>
my
dear
,
if
you
please
.
 
<EOS>
Said
I
<EOS>
,
Sir
,
I
will
never
do
any
thing
of
this
kind
without
letting
you
know
what
I
do
.
 
<EOS>
He
most
generously
answered
,
I
shall
then
,
perhaps
,
have
you
do
less
good
than
you
would
otherwise
do
,
from
a
doubt
of
me
;
though
,
I
hope
,
your
discretion
,
and
my
own
temper
,
which
is
not
avaricious
,
will
make
such
doubt
causeless
.
  
<EOS>
Now
,
my
dear
,
continued
he
,
I
'll
tell
you
how
we
will
order
this
point
,
to
avoid
even
the
shadow
of
uneasiness
on
one
side
,
or
doubt
on
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
As
to
your
father
and
mother
,
in
the
first
place
,
they
shall
be
quite
out
of
the
question
;
for
I
have
already
determined
in
my
mind
about
them
;
and
it
is
thus
:
They
shall
go
down
,
if
they
and
you
think
well
of
it
,
to
my
little
Kentish
estate
;
which
I
once
mentioned
to
you
in
such
a
manner
,
as
made
you
reject
it
with
a
nobleness
of
mind
,
that
gave
me
pain
then
,
but
pleasure
since
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
a
pretty
little
farm
,
and
house
,
untenanted
,
upon
that
estate
,
and
tolerably
well
stocked
,
and
I
will
further
stock
it
for
them
;
for
such
industrious
folks
wo
n't
know
how
to
live
without
some
employment
;
And
it
shall
be
theirs
for
both
their
lives
,
without
paying
any
rent
;
and
I
will
allow
them
50l
.
<EOS>
per
annum
besides
,
that
they
may
keep
up
the
stock
,
and
be
kind
to
any
other
of
their
relations
,
without
being
beholden
to
you
or
me
for
small
matters
;
and
for
greater
,
where
needful
,
you
shall
always
have
it
in
your
power
to
accommodate
them
;
for
I
shall
never
question
your
prudence
.
 
<EOS>
And
we
will
,
so
long
as
God
spares
our
lives
,
go
down
,
once
a
year
,
to
see
them
;
and
they
shall
come
up
,
as
often
as
they
please
<EOS>
,
it
can
not
be
too
often
,
to
see
us
:
for
I
mean
not
this
,
my
dear
,
to
send
them
from
us
.
 
<EOS>
Before
I
proceed
,
does
my
Pamela
like
this
?
  
<EOS>
O
,
sir
,
said
I
,
the
English
tongue
affords
not
words
,
or
,
<EOS>
at
least
,
I
have
them
not
,
to
express
sufficiently
my
gratitude
!
 
<EOS>
Teach
me
,
dear
sir
,
continued
I
,
and
pressed
his
dear
hand
to
my
lips
,
teach
me
some
other
language
,
if
there
be
any
,
that
abounds
with
more
grateful
terms
;
that
I
may
not
thus
be
choked
with
meanings
,
for
which
I
can
find
no
utterance
.
  
<EOS>
My
charmer
!
<EOS>
says
he
,
your
language
is
all
wonderful
,
as
your
sentiments
;
and
you
most
abound
,
when
you
seem
most
to
want
!
 
<EOS>
All
that
I
wish
,
is
to
find
my
proposals
agreeable
to
you
;
and
if
my
first
are
not
,
my
second
shall
be
,
if
I
can
but
know
what
you
wish
.
  
<EOS>
Did
I
say
too
much
,
my
dearest
parents
,
when
I
said
,
He
was
,
if
possible
,
kinder
and
kinder
?
 
<EOS>
O
the
blessed
man
!
<EOS>
how
my
heart
is
overwhelmed
with
his
goodness
!
  
<EOS>
Well
,
said
he
,
my
dearest
,
let
me
desire
you
to
mention
this
to
them
,
to
see
if
they
approve
it
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
if
it
be
your
choice
,
and
theirs
,
to
have
them
nearer
to
you
,
or
even
under
the
same
roof
with
you
,
I
will
freely
consent
to
it
.
  
<EOS>
O
no
,
sir
,
said
I
,
(
<EOS>
and
I
fear
almost
sinned
in
my
grateful
flight
,
)
<EOS>
I
am
sure
they
would
not
choose
that
;
they
could
not
,
perhaps
,
serve
God
so
well
if
they
were
to
live
with
you
:
For
,
so
constantly
seeing
the
hand
that
blesses
them
,
they
would
,
it
may
be
,
as
must
be
my
care
to
avoid
,
be
tempted
to
look
no
further
in
their
gratitude
,
than
to
the
dear
dispenser
of
such
innumerable
benefits
.
  
<EOS>
Excellent
creature
!
<EOS>
said
he
:
<EOS>
My
beloved
wants
no
language
,
nor
sentiments
neither
;
and
her
charming
thoughts
,
so
sweetly
expressed
,
would
grace
any
language
;
and
this
is
a
blessing
almost
peculiar
to
my
fairest
.
 
<EOS>
Your
so
kind
acceptance
,
my
Pamela
,
added
he
,
repays
the
benefit
with
interest
,
and
leaves
me
under
obligation
to
your
goodness
.
  
<EOS>
But
now
,
my
dearest
,
I
will
tell
you
what
we
will
do
,
with
regard
to
points
of
your
own
private
charity
;
for
far
be
it
from
me
,
to
put
under
that
name
the
subject
we
have
been
mentioning
;
because
that
,
and
more
than
that
,
is
duty
to
persons
so
worthy
,
and
so
nearly
related
to
my
Pamela
,
and
,
as
such
,
to
myself
.
 
<EOS>
O
how
the
sweet
man
outdoes
me
,
in
thoughts
,
words
,
power
,
and
every
thing
!
  
<EOS>
And
this
,
said
he
,
lies
in
very
small
compass
;
for
I
will
allow
you
two
hundred
pounds
a
year
,
which
Longman
shall
constantly
pay
you
,
at
fifty
pounds
a
quarter
,
for
your
own
use
,
and
<EOS>
of
which
I
expect
no
account
;
to
commence
from
the
day
you
enter
into
my
other
house
:
I
mean
,
said
he
,
that
the
first
fifty
pounds
shall
then
be
due
;
because
you
shall
have
something
to
begin
with
.
 
<EOS>
And
,
added
the
dear
generous
man
,
if
this
be
pleasing
to
you
,
let
it
,
since
you
say
you
want
words
,
be
signified
by
such
a
sweet
kiss
as
you
gave
me
yesterday
.
 
<EOS>
I
hesitated
not
a
moment
to
comply
with
these
obliging
terms
,
and
threw
my
arms
about
his
dear
neck
,
though
in
the
chariot
,
and
blessed
his
goodness
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
indeed
,
sir
,
said
I
,
I
can
not
bear
this
generous
treatment
!
 
<EOS>
He
was
pleased
to
say
,
Do
n't
be
uneasy
,
my
dear
,
about
these
trifles
:
<EOS>
God
has
blessed
me
with
a
very
good
estate
,
and
all
of
it
in
a
prosperous
condition
,
and
generally
well
tenanted
.
 
<EOS>
I
lay
up
money
every
year
,
and
have
,
besides
,
large
sums
in
government
and
other
securities
;
so
that
you
will
find
,
<EOS>
what
I
have
hitherto
promised
,
is
very
short
of
that
proportion
of
my
substance
,
which
,
as
my
dearest
wife
,
you
have
a
right
to
.
  
<EOS>
In
this
sweet
manner
did
we
pass
our
time
till
evening
,
when
the
chariot
brought
us
home
;
and
then
our
supper
succeeded
in
the
same
agreeable
manner
.
 
<EOS>
And
thus
,
in
a
rapturous
circle
,
the
time
moves
on
;
every
hour
bringing
with
it
something
more
delightful
than
the
past
!
 
<EOS>
Sure
nobody
was
ever
so
blest
as
I
!
  
<EOS>
Sunday
,
the
fourth
day
of
my
happiness
.
  
<EOS>
Not
going
to
chapel
this
morning
,
the
reason
of
which
I
told
you
,
I
bestowed
the
time
,
from
the
hour
of
my
beloved
's
rising
,
to
breakfast
,
in
prayer
and
thanksgiving
,
in
my
closet
;
and
now
I
begin
to
be
quite
easy
,
cheerful
,
and
free
in
my
spirits
;
and
the
rather
,
as
I
find
myself
encouraged
by
the
tranquillity
,
and
pleasing
vivacity
,
in
the
temper
and
behaviour
of
my
beloved
,
who
thereby
shews
he
does
not
repent
of
his
goodness
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
attended
him
to
breakfast
with
great
pleasure
and
freedom
,
and
he
seemed
quite
pleased
with
me
,
and
said
,
Now
does
my
dearest
begin
to
look
upon
me
with
an
air
of
serenity
and
satisfaction
:
it
shall
be
always
,
added
he
,
my
delight
to
give
you
occasion
for
this
sweet
becoming
aspect
of
confidence
and
pleasure
in
me
.
 
<EOS>
My
heart
,
dear
sir
,
said
I
,
is
quite
easy
,
and
has
lost
all
its
foolish
tumults
,
which
,
combating
with
my
gratitude
,
might
give
an
unacceptable
appearance
to
my
behaviour
:
but
now
your
goodness
,
sir
,
has
enabled
it
to
get
the
better
of
its
uneasy
apprehensions
,
and
my
heart
is
all
of
one
piece
,
and
devoted
to
you
,
and
grateful
tranquillity
.
 
<EOS>
And
could
I
be
so
happy
as
to
see
you
and
my
good
Lady
Davers
reconciled
<EOS>
,
I
have
nothing
in
this
world
to
wish
for
more
,
but
the
continuance
of
your
favour
.
 
<EOS>
He
said
,
I
wish
this
reconciliation
,
my
dearest
,
as
well
as
you
:
and
I
do
assure
you
,
more
for
your
sake
than
my
own
;
and
if
she
would
behave
tolerably
,
I
would
make
the
terms
easier
to
her
,
for
that
reason
.
  
<EOS>
He
said
,
I
will
lay
down
one
rule
for
you
,
my
Pamela
,
to
observe
in
your
dress
;
and
I
will
tell
you
every
thing
I
like
or
dislike
,
as
it
occurs
to
me
:
and
I
would
have
you
do
the
same
,
on
your
part
;
that
nothing
may
be
upon
either
of
our
minds
that
may
occasion
the
least
reservedness
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
often
observed
,
in
married
folks
,
that
,
in
a
little
while
,
the
lady
grows
careless
in
her
dress
;
which
,
to
me
,
looks
as
if
she
would
take
no
pains
to
secure
the
affection
she
had
gained
;
and
shews
a
slight
to
her
husband
,
that
she
had
not
to
her
lover
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
you
must
know
,
this
has
always
given
me
great
offence
;
and
I
should
not
forgive
it
,
even
in
my
Pamela
:
though
she
would
have
this
excuse
for
herself
,
that
thousands
could
not
make
,
That
she
looks
lovely
in
every
thing
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
my
dear
,
I
shall
expect
of
you
always
to
be
dressed
by
dinner
-
time
,
except
something
extraordinary
happens
;
and
this
,
whether
you
are
to
go
abroad
,
or
stay
at
home
.
 
<EOS>
For
this
,
my
love
,
will
continue
to
you
that
sweet
ease
in
your
dress
and
behaviour
,
which
you
are
so
happy
a
mistress
of
;
and
whomsoever
I
bring
home
with
me
to
my
table
,
you
'll
be
in
readiness
to
receive
them
;
and
will
not
want
to
make
those
foolish
apologies
to
unexpected
visitors
,
that
carry
with
them
a
reflection
on
the
conduct
of
those
who
make
them
;
and
,
besides
,
will
convince
me
,
that
you
think
yourself
obliged
to
appear
as
graceful
to
your
husband
,
as
you
would
to
persons
less
familiar
to
your
sight
.
  
<EOS>
This
,
dear
sir
,
said
I
,
is
a
most
obliging
injunction
;
and
I
most
heartily
thank
you
for
it
,
and
will
always
take
care
to
obey
it
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
my
dear
,
said
he
,
you
may
better
do
this
than
half
your
sex
;
because
they
too
generally
act
in
such
a
manner
,
as
if
they
seemed
to
think
it
the
privilege
of
birth
and
fortune
,
to
turn
day
into
night
,
and
night
into
day
,
and
are
seldom
stirring
till
it
is
time
to
sit
down
to
dinner
;
and
so
all
the
good
old
family
rules
are
reversed
:
For
they
breakfast
,
when
they
should
dine
;
dine
,
when
they
should
sup
;
and
sup
,
when
they
should
go
to
bed
;
and
,
by
the
help
of
dear
quadrille
,
sometimes
go
to
bed
when
they
should
rise
.
 
<EOS>
In
all
things
<EOS>
but
these
,
my
dear
,
continued
he
<EOS>
,
I
expect
you
to
be
a
lady
.
 
<EOS>
And
my
good
mother
was
one
of
this
oldfashioned
cut
,
and
,
in
all
other
respects
,
as
worthy
a
lady
as
any
in
the
kingdom
.
<EOS>
And
so
you
have
not
been
used
to
the
new
way
,
and
may
the
easier
practise
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
Dear
sir
,
said
I
,
pray
give
me
more
of
your
sweet
injunctions
.
 
<EOS>
Why
then
,
continued
he
,
I
shall
,
in
the
usual
course
,
and
generally
,
if
not
hindered
by
company
,
like
to
go
to
bed
with
my
dearest
by
eleven
;
and
,
if
I
do
n't
,
sha
n't
hinder
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
ordinarily
now
rise
by
six
in
summer
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
allow
you
to
be
half
an
hour
after
me
,
or
so
.
  
<EOS>
Then
you
'll
have
some
time
you
may
call
your
own
,
till
you
give
me
your
company
to
breakfast
;
which
may
be
always
so
,
as
that
we
may
have
done
at
a
little
after
nine
.
  
<EOS>
Then
will
you
have
several
hours
again
at
your
disposal
,
till
two
o'clock
,
when
I
shall
like
to
sit
down
at
table
.
  
<EOS>
You
will
then
have
several
useful
hours
more
to
employ
yourself
in
,
as
you
shall
best
like
;
and
I
would
generally
go
to
supper
by
eight
;
and
when
we
are
resolved
to
stick
to
these
oldfashioned
rules
,
as
near
as
we
can
<EOS>
,
we
shall
have
our
visitors
conform
to
them
too
,
and
expect
them
from
us
,
and
suit
themselves
accordingly
:
<EOS>
For
I
have
always
observed
,
that
it
is
in
every
one
's
power
to
prescribe
rules
to
himself
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
only
standing
a
few
ridiculous
jests
at
first
,
and
that
too
from
such
,
generally
,
as
are
not
the
most
worthy
to
be
minded
;
and
,
after
a
while
,
they
will
say
,
It
signifies
nothing
to
ask
him
:
he
will
have
his
own
way
.
<EOS>
There
is
no
putting
him
out
of
his
bias
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
a
regular
piece
of
clock
-
work
,
they
will
joke
,
and
all
that
:
<EOS>
And
why
,
my
dear
,
should
we
not
be
so
?
 
<EOS>
For
man
is
as
frail
a
piece
of
machinery
as
any
clock
-
work
whatever
;
and
,
by
irregularity
,
is
as
subject
to
be
disordered
.
  
<EOS>
Then
,
my
dear
,
continued
the
charming
man
,
when
they
see
they
are
received
,
at
my
own
times
,
with
an
open
countenance
and
cheerful
heart
;
when
they
see
plenty
and
variety
at
my
board
,
and
meet
a
kind
and
hearty
welcome
from
us
both
;
they
will
not
offer
to
break
in
upon
my
conditions
,
nor
grudge
me
my
regular
hours
:
<EOS>
And
as
most
of
these
people
have
nothing
to
do
,
except
to
rise
in
a
morning
,
they
may
as
well
come
to
breakfast
with
us
at
half
an
hour
after
eight
,
in
summer
,
as
at
ten
or
eleven
;
to
dinner
at
two
,
as
at
four
,
five
,
or
six
;
and
to
supper
at
eight
,
as
at
ten
or
eleven
.
 
<EOS>
And
then
our
servants
,
too
,
will
know
,
generally
,
<EOS>
the
times
of
their
business
,
and
the
hours
of
their
leisure
or
recess
;
and
we
,
as
well
as
they
,
shall
reap
the
benefits
of
this
regularity
.
 
<EOS>
And
who
knows
,
my
dear
,
but
we
may
revive
the
good
oldfashion
in
our
neighbourhood
,
by
this
means
?
 
<EOS>
At
least
it
will
be
doing
our
parts
towards
it
;
and
answering
the
good
lesson
I
learned
at
school
,
Every
one
mend
one
.
 
<EOS>
And
the
worst
that
will
happen
will
be
,
that
when
some
of
my
brother
rakes
,
such
as
those
who
broke
in
upon
us
,
so
unwelcomely
,
last
Thursday
,
are
got
out
of
the
way
,
if
that
can
ever
be
,
and
begin
to
consider
who
they
shall
go
to
dine
with
in
their
rambles
<EOS>
,
they
will
only
say
,
We
must
not
go
to
him
,
for
his
dinner
-
time
is
over
;
and
so
they
'll
reserve
me
for
another
time
,
when
they
happen
to
suit
it
better
;
or
,
perhaps
,
they
will
take
a
supper
and
a
bed
with
me
instead
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
Now
,
my
dearest
,
continued
the
kind
man
,
you
see
here
are
more
of
my
injunctions
,
as
you
call
them
;
and
though
I
will
not
be
so
set
,
as
to
quarrel
,
if
they
are
not
always
exactly
complied
with
;
yet
,
<EOS>
as
I
know
you
wo
n't
think
them
unreasonable
,
I
shall
be
glad
they
may
,
as
often
as
they
can
;
and
you
will
give
your
orders
accordingly
to
your
Mrs.
Jervis
,
who
is
a
good
woman
,
and
will
take
pleasure
in
obeying
you
.
  
<EOS>
O
dearest
,
dear
sir
,
said
I
,
have
you
nothing
more
to
honour
me
with
?
<EOS>
You
oblige
and
improve
me
at
the
same
time
.
 
<EOS>
What
a
happy
lot
is
mine
!
  
<EOS>
Why
,
let
me
see
,
my
dearest
,
said
he
 
<EOS>
But
I
think
of
no
more
at
present
:
For
it
would
be
needless
to
say
how
much
I
value
you
for
your
natural
sweetness
of
temper
,
and
that
open
cheerfulness
of
countenance
,
which
adorns
you
,
when
nothing
has
given
my
fairest
apprehensions
for
her
virtue
:
A
sweetness
,
and
a
cheerfulness
,
that
prepossesses
in
your
favour
,
at
first
sight
,
the
mind
of
every
one
that
beholds
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
need
not
<EOS>
,
I
hope
,
say
,
that
I
would
have
you
diligently
preserve
this
sweet
appearance
:
Let
no
thwarting
accident
,
no
cross
fortune
,
(
for
we
must
not
expect
to
be
exempt
from
such
,
happy
as
we
now
are
in
each
other
!
)
<EOS>
deprive
this
sweet
face
of
this
its
principal
grace
:
<EOS>
And
when
any
thing
unpleasing
happens
,
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
at
farthest
,
begin
to
mistrust
yourself
,
and
apply
to
your
glass
;
and
if
you
see
a
gloom
arising
,
or
arisen
,
banish
it
instantly
;
smooth
your
dear
countenance
;
resume
your
former
composure
;
and
then
,
my
dearest
,
whose
heart
must
always
be
seen
in
her
face
,
and
can
not
be
a
hypocrite
,
will
find
this
a
means
to
smooth
her
passions
also
:
<EOS>
And
if
the
occasion
be
too
strong
for
so
sudden
a
conquest
,
she
will
know
how
to
do
it
more
effectually
,
by
repairing
to
her
closet
,
and
begging
that
gracious
assistance
,
which
has
never
yet
failed
her
:
<EOS>
And
so
shall
I
,
my
dear
,
who
,
as
you
once
but
too
justly
observed
,
have
been
too
much
indulged
by
my
good
mother
,
have
an
example
from
you
,
as
well
as
a
pleasure
in
you
,
which
will
never
be
palled
.
  
<EOS>
One
thing
,
continued
he
<EOS>
,
I
have
frequently
observed
at
the
house
of
many
a
gentleman
,
That
when
we
have
unexpectedly
visited
,
or
broken
in
upon
the
family
order
laid
down
by
the
lady
;
and
especially
if
any
of
us
have
lain
under
the
suspicion
of
having
occasionally
seduced
our
married
companion
into
bad
hours
,
or
given
indifferent
examples
,
the
poor
gentleman
has
been
oddly
affected
at
our
coming
;
though
the
good
breeding
of
the
lady
has
made
her
just
keep
up
appearances
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
looked
so
conscious
;
has
been
so
afraid
,
as
it
were
,
to
disoblige
;
has
made
so
many
excuses
for
some
of
us
,
before
we
had
been
accused
,
as
have
always
shewn
me
how
unwelcome
we
have
been
;
and
how
much
he
is
obliged
to
compound
with
his
lady
for
a
tolerable
reception
of
us
;
and
,
perhaps
,
she
too
,
in
proportion
to
the
honest
man
's
concern
to
court
her
smiles
,
has
been
more
reserved
,
stiff
,
and
formal
;
and
has
behaved
with
an
indifference
and
slight
that
has
often
made
me
wish
myself
out
of
her
house
;
for
too
plainly
have
I
seen
that
it
was
not
his
.
  
<EOS>
This
,
my
dear
,
you
will
judge
,
by
my
description
,
has
afforded
me
subject
for
animadversion
upon
the
married
life
;
for
a
man
may
not
(
though
,
in
the
main
,
he
is
willing
to
flatter
himself
that
he
is
master
of
his
house
,
and
will
assert
his
prerogative
upon
great
occasions
,
when
it
is
strongly
invaded
)
be
always
willing
to
contend
;
and
such
women
as
those
I
have
described
,
are
always
ready
to
take
the
field
,
and
are
worse
enemies
than
the
old
Parthians
,
who
annoy
most
when
they
seem
to
retreat
;
and
never
fail
to
return
to
the
charge
again
,
and
carry
on
the
offensive
war
,
till
they
have
tired
out
resistance
,
and
made
the
husband
willing
,
like
a
vanquished
enemy
,
to
compound
for
small
matters
,
in
order
to
preserve
something
.
 
<EOS>
At
least
the
poor
man
does
not
care
to
let
his
friends
see
his
case
;
and
so
will
not
provoke
a
fire
to
break
out
,
that
he
sees
(
and
so
do
his
friends
too
)
<EOS>
the
meek
lady
has
much
ado
to
smother
;
and
which
,
very
possibly
,
burns
with
a
most
comfortable
ardour
,
after
we
are
gone
.
  
<EOS>
You
smile
,
my
Pamela
,
said
he
,
at
this
whimsical
picture
;
and
,
I
am
sure
,
I
never
shall
have
reason
to
include
you
in
these
disagreeable
outlines
;
but
yet
I
will
say
,
that
I
expect
from
you
,
whoever
comes
to
my
house
,
that
you
accustom
yourself
to
one
even
,
uniform
complaisance
:
That
no
frown
take
place
on
your
brow
:
<EOS>
That
however
ill
or
well
provided
we
may
be
for
their
reception
,
you
shew
<EOS>
no
flutter
or
discomposure
:
<EOS>
That
whoever
you
may
have
in
your
company
at
the
time
,
you
signify
not
,
by
the
least
reserved
look
,
that
the
stranger
is
come
upon
you
unseasonably
,
or
at
a
time
you
wished
he
had
not
.
 
<EOS>
But
be
facetious
,
kind
,
obliging
to
all
;
and
,
if
to
one
more
than
another
,
to
such
as
have
the
least
reason
to
expect
it
from
you
,
or
who
are
most
inferior
at
the
table
;
for
thus
will
you
,
my
Pamela
,
cheer
the
doubting
mind
,
quiet
the
uneasy
heart
,
and
diffuse
ease
,
pleasure
,
and
tranquillity
,
around
my
board
.
  
<EOS>
And
be
sure
,
my
dear
,
continued
he
<EOS>
,
let
no
little
accidents
ruffle
your
temper
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
never
forget
once
that
I
was
at
Lady
Arthur
's
;
and
a
footman
happened
to
stumble
,
and
let
fall
a
fine
china
dish
,
and
broke
it
all
to
pieces
<EOS>
:
It
was
grievous
to
see
the
uneasiness
it
gave
the
poor
lady
:
<EOS>
And
she
was
so
sincere
in
it
,
that
she
suffered
it
to
spread
all
over
the
company
;
and
it
was
a
pretty
large
one
too
;
and
not
a
person
in
it
but
turned
either
her
consoler
,
or
fell
into
stories
of
the
like
misfortunes
;
and
so
we
all
became
,
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
,
<EOS>
nothing
but
blundering
footmen
,
and
careless
servants
,
or
were
turned
into
broken
jars
,
plates
,
glasses
,
tea
-
cups
,
and
such
like
brittle
substances
.
 
<EOS>
And
it
affected
me
so
much
,
that
,
when
I
came
home
,
I
went
to
bed
,
and
dreamt
,
that
Robin
,
with
the
handle
of
his
whip
,
broke
the
fore
glass
of
my
chariot
;
and
I
was
so
solicitous
,
methought
,
to
keep
the
good
lady
in
countenance
for
her
anger
,
that
I
broke
his
head
in
revenge
,
and
stabbed
one
of
my
coach
-
horses
.
 
<EOS>
And
all
the
comfort
I
had
when
it
was
done
,
methought
,
was
,
that
I
had
not
exposed
myself
before
company
;
and
there
were
no
sufferers
,
but
guilty
Robin
,
and
one
innocent
coach
-
horse
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
exceedingly
diverted
with
the
facetious
hints
,
and
the
pleasant
manner
in
which
he
gave
them
;
and
I
promised
to
improve
by
the
excellent
lessons
contained
in
them
.
  
<EOS>
I
then
went
up
and
dressed
myself
,
as
like
a
bride
as
I
could
,
in
my
best
clothes
;
and
,
on
inquiry
,
hearing
my
dearest
master
was
gone
to
walk
in
the
garden
<EOS>
,
I
went
to
find
him
out
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
reading
in
the
little
alcove
;
and
I
said
,
Sir
,
am
I
licensed
to
intrude
upon
you
?
 
<EOS>
No
,
my
dear
,
said
he
,
because
you
can
not
intrude
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
so
wholly
yours
,
<EOS>
that
,
wherever
I
am
,
you
have
not
only
a
right
to
join
me
,
but
you
do
me
a
very
acceptable
favour
at
the
same
time
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
,
sir
,
said
I
,
obeyed
your
first
kind
injunction
,
as
to
dressing
myself
before
dinner
;
but
may
be
you
are
busy
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
He
put
up
the
papers
he
was
reading
,
and
said
,
I
can
have
no
business
or
pleasure
of
equal
value
to
your
company
,
my
dear
.
 
<EOS>
What
were
you
going
to
say
?
 
<EOS>
Only
,
sir
,
to
know
if
you
have
any
more
kind
injunctions
to
give
me
?
 
<EOS>
I
could
hear
you
talk
a
whole
day
together
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
very
obliging
,
Pamela
,
said
he
;
but
you
are
so
perfectly
what
I
wish
,
that
I
might
have
spared
those
I
gave
you
;
but
I
was
willing
you
should
have
a
taste
of
my
freedom
with
you
,
to
put
you
upon
the
like
with
me
:
<EOS>
For
I
am
confident
there
can
be
no
friendship
lasting
,
without
freedom
,
and
without
communicating
to
one
another
even
the
little
caprices
,
if
my
Pamela
can
have
any
such
,
which
may
occasion
uneasiness
to
either
.
  
<EOS>
Now
,
my
dear
,
said
he
,
be
so
kind
as
to
find
some
fault
with
me
,
and
tell
me
what
you
would
wish
me
to
do
,
to
appear
more
agreeable
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
O
sir
,
said
I
,
and
I
could
have
kissed
him
,
but
for
shame
,
(
To
be
sure
I
shall
grow
a
sad
fond
hussy
,
)
<EOS>
I
have
not
one
single
thing
to
wish
for
;
no
,
not
one
!
 
<EOS>
He
saluted
me
very
kindly
,
and
said
,
He
should
be
sorry
if
I
had
,
and
forbore
to
speak
it
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
think
,
<EOS>
my
dear
sir
,
said
I
,
that
your
Pamela
has
no
conscience
?
 
<EOS>
Do
you
think
,
that
because
you
so
kindly
oblige
her
,
and
delight
in
obliging
her
,
that
she
must
rack
her
invention
for
trials
of
your
goodness
,
and
knows
not
when
she
's
happy
?
 
<EOS>
O
my
dearest
sir
,
added
I
,
less
than
one
half
of
the
favours
you
have
so
generously
conferred
upon
me
,
would
have
exceeded
my
utmost
wishes
!
  
<EOS>
My
dear
angel
,
said
he
,
and
kissed
me
again
,
I
shall
be
troublesome
to
you
with
my
kisses
,
if
you
continue
thus
sweetly
obliging
in
your
actions
and
expressions
.
 
<EOS>
O
sir
,
said
I
,
I
have
been
thinking
,
as
I
was
dressing
myself
,
what
excellent
lessons
you
teach
me
!
  
<EOS>
When
you
commanded
me
,
at
your
table
to
cheer
the
doubting
mind
and
comfort
the
uneasy
heart
,
and
to
behave
most
kindly
to
those
who
have
least
reason
to
expect
it
,
and
are
most
inferior
;
how
sweetly
,
in
every
instance
that
could
possibly
occur
,
have
you
done
this
yourself
by
your
poor
,
unworthy
Pamela
,
till
you
have
diffused
,
in
your
own
dear
words
,
ease
,
pleasure
,
and
tranquillity
,
around
my
glad
heart
!
  
<EOS>
Then
again
,
sir
,
when
you
bid
me
not
be
disturbed
by
little
accidents
,
or
by
strangers
coming
in
upon
me
unexpectedly
,
how
noble
an
instance
did
you
give
me
of
this
,
when
,
on
our
happy
wedding
-
day
,
the
coming
of
Sir
Charles
Hargrave
,
and
the
other
two
gentlemen
,
(
for
which
you
were
quite
unprovided
,
and
which
hindered
our
happiness
of
dining
together
on
that
chosen
day
,
)
did
not
so
disturb
you
,
but
that
you
entertained
the
gentlemen
pleasantly
,
and
parted
with
them
civilly
and
kindly
!
 
<EOS>
What
charming
instances
are
these
,
I
have
been
recollecting
with
pleasure
,
of
your
pursuing
the
doctrine
you
deliver
.
  
<EOS>
My
dear
,
said
he
,
these
observations
are
very
kind
in
you
,
and
much
to
my
advantage
:
<EOS>
But
if
I
do
not
always
(
for
I
fear
these
were
too
much
accidents
)
so
well
pursue
the
doctrines
I
lay
down
,
my
Pamela
must
not
expect
that
my
imperfections
will
be
a
plea
for
her
nonobservance
of
my
lessons
,
as
you
call
them
;
for
,
I
doubt
I
shall
never
be
half
so
perfect
as
you
;
and
so
I
can
not
permit
you
to
recede
in
your
goodness
,
though
I
may
find
myself
unable
to
advance
as
I
ought
in
my
duty
.
  
<EOS>
I
hope
,
sir
,
said
I
,
by
God
's
grace
,
I
never
shall
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
it
,
said
he
;
but
I
only
mention
this
,
knowing
my
own
defects
,
lest
my
future
lessons
should
not
be
so
well
warranted
by
my
practice
,
as
in
the
instances
you
have
kindly
recollected
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
pleased
to
take
notice
of
my
dress
;
and
spanning
my
waist
with
his
hands
,
said
,
What
a
sweet
shape
is
here
!
 
<EOS>
It
would
make
one
regret
to
lose
it
;
and
yet
,
my
beloved
Pamela
,
I
shall
think
nothing
but
that
loss
wanting
,
to
complete
my
happiness
.
 
<EOS>
I
put
my
bold
hand
before
his
mouth
,
and
said
,
Hush
,
hush
!
 
<EOS>
O
fie
,
sir
!
 
<EOS>
The
freest
thing
you
have
ever
yet
said
,
since
I
have
been
yours
!
 
<EOS>
He
kissed
my
hand
,
and
said
,
Such
an
innocent
wish
,
my
dearest
,
may
be
permitted
me
,
because
it
is
the
end
of
the
institution
.
 
<EOS>
But
say
,
Would
such
a
case
be
unwelcome
to
my
Pamela
?
  
<EOS>
I
will
say
,
sir
,
said
I
,
and
hid
my
blushing
face
on
his
bosom
,
that
your
wishes
,
in
every
thing
,
shall
be
mine
;
but
,
pray
,
sir
,
say
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
He
kindly
saluted
me
,
and
thanked
me
,
and
changed
the
subject
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
not
too
free
,
I
hope
.
  
<EOS>
Thus
we
talked
,
till
we
heard
the
coaches
;
and
then
he
said
,
Stay
here
,
in
the
garden
,
my
dear
,
and
I
'll
bring
the
company
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
And
when
he
was
gone
,
I
passed
by
the
back
-
door
,
kneeled
down
against
it
,
and
blessed
God
for
not
permitting
my
then
so
much
desired
escape
.
 
<EOS>
I
went
to
the
pond
,
and
kneeled
down
on
the
mossy
bank
,
and
again
blessed
God
there
,
for
his
mercy
in
my
escape
from
myself
,
my
then
worst
enemy
,
though
I
thought
I
had
none
but
enemies
,
and
no
friend
near
me
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
I
ought
to
do
in
almost
every
step
of
this
garden
,
and
every
room
in
this
house
!
  
<EOS>
And
I
was
bending
my
steps
to
the
dear
little
chapel
,
to
make
my
acknowledgment
there
;
but
I
saw
the
company
coming
towards
me
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Darnford
said
,
So
,
Miss
Andrews
,
how
do
you
do
now
?
 
<EOS>
O
,
you
look
so
easy
,
so
sweetly
,
so
pleased
,
that
I
know
you
'll
let
me
dance
at
your
wedding
,
for
I
shall
long
to
be
there
!
 
<EOS>
Lady
Jones
was
pleased
to
say
I
looked
like
an
angel
:
<EOS>
And
Mrs.
Peters
said
,
I
improved
upon
them
every
time
they
saw
me
.
 
<EOS>
Lady
Darnford
was
also
pleased
to
make
me
a
fine
compliment
,
and
said
,
I
looked
freer
and
easier
every
time
she
saw
me
.
<EOS>
Dear
heart
!
 
<EOS>
I
wish
,
<EOS>
thought
I
,
you
would
spare
these
compliments
;
for
I
shall
have
some
joke
,
I
doubt
,
passed
on
me
by
-
and
-
by
<EOS>
,
that
will
make
me
suffer
for
all
these
fine
things
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Peters
said
,
softly
,
God
bless
you
,
dear
daughter
!
 
<EOS>
But
not
so
much
as
my
wife
knows
it
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
Simon
came
in
last
,
and
took
me
by
the
hand
,
and
said
,
Mr.
B
#
#
#
#
,
by
your
leave
;
and
kissed
my
hand
five
or
six
times
,
as
if
he
was
mad
;
and
held
it
with
both
his
,
and
made
a
very
free
jest
,
by
way
of
compliment
,
in
his
way
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
I
think
a
young
rake
is
hardly
tolerable
;
but
an
old
rake
,
and
an
old
beau
,
are
two
very
sad
things
!
  
<EOS>
And
all
this
before
daughters
<EOS>
,
women
-
grown
!
 
<EOS>
I
whispered
my
dearest
,
a
little
after
,
and
said
,
I
fear
I
shall
suffer
much
from
Sir
Simon
's
rude
jokes
,
by
-
and
-
by
,
when
you
reveal
the
matter
.
 
<EOS>
"
Tis
<EOS>
his
way
,
my
dear
,
said
he
;
you
must
now
grow
above
these
things
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Nanny
Darnford
said
to
me
,
with
a
sort
of
half
grave
,
ironical
air
,
 
Well
,
Miss
Andrews
,
if
I
may
judge
by
your
easy
deportment
now
,
to
what
it
was
when
I
saw
you
last
,
I
hope
you
will
let
my
sister
,
if
you
wo
n't
me
,
see
the
happy
knot
tied
!
 
<EOS>
For
she
is
quite
wild
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
courtesied
,
and
only
said
,
You
are
all
very
good
to
me
,
ladies
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Peters
's
niece
said
,
Well
,
Miss
Andrews
,
I
hope
,
before
we
part
,
we
shall
be
told
the
happy
day
.
 
<EOS>
My
good
master
heard
her
,
and
said
,
<EOS>
You
shall
,
you
shall
,
madam
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
pure
,
said
Miss
Darnford
.
  
<EOS>
He
took
me
aside
,
and
said
softly
,
Shall
I
lead
them
to
the
alcove
,
and
tell
them
there
,
or
stay
till
we
go
in
to
dinner
?
 
<EOS>
Neither
,
sir
,
I
think
,
said
I
,
<EOS>
I
fear
I
sha
n't
stand
it
.
 
<EOS>
Nay
,
said
he
,
they
must
know
it
;
I
would
not
have
invited
them
else
.
 
<EOS>
Why
then
,
sir
,
said
I
,
let
it
alone
till
they
are
going
away
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
replied
he
,
you
must
pull
off
your
ring
.
<EOS>
No
,
no
,
sir
,
said
I
,
that
I
must
not
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
said
he
,
do
you
tell
Miss
Darnford
of
it
yourself
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
sir
,
answered
I
,
I
can
not
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
came
officiously
to
ask
my
master
,
just
then
,
if
she
should
bring
a
glass
of
rhenish
and
sugar
before
dinner
,
for
the
gentlemen
and
ladies
:
And
<EOS>
he
said
,
That
's
well
thought
of
;
bring
it
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
.
  
<EOS>
And
she
came
,
with
Nan
attending
her
,
with
two
bottles
and
glasses
,
and
a
salver
;
and
must
needs
,
making
a
low
courtesy
,
offered
first
to
me
;
saying
,
Will
your
ladyship
begin
?
 
<EOS>
I
coloured
like
scarlet
,
and
said
,
No
;
 
my
master
,
to
be
sure
!
  
<EOS>
But
they
all
took
the
hint
;
and
Miss
Darnford
said
,
I
'll
be
hanged
if
they
have
not
stolen
a
wedding
!
<EOS>
said
Mrs.
Peters
,
It
must
certainly
be
so
!
 
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
Mr.
Peters
.
  
<EOS>
I
'll
assure
you
,
said
he
,
I
have
not
married
them
.
 
<EOS>
Where
were
you
,
said
she
,
and
Mr.
Williams
,
last
Thursday
morning
?
said
Sir
Simon
,
Let
me
alone
,
let
me
alone
;
if
any
thing
has
been
stolen
,
I
'll
find
it
out
!
 
<EOS>
I
'm
a
justice
of
the
peace
,
you
know
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
he
took
me
by
the
hand
,
and
said
,
Come
,
madam
,
answer
me
,
by
the
oath
you
have
taken
:
<EOS>
Are
you
married
or
not
?
  
<EOS>
My
master
smiled
,
to
see
me
look
so
like
a
fool
;
and
I
said
,
Pray
,
Sir
Simon
!
 
<EOS>
Ay
,
ay
,
said
he
;
I
thought
you
did
not
look
so
smirking
upon
us
for
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
then
,
Pamela
,
said
my
master
,
since
your
blushes
discover
you
,
do
n't
be
ashamed
,
but
confess
the
truth
!
  
<EOS>
Now
,
said
Miss
Darnford
,
I
am
quite
angry
;
and
,
said
Lady
Darnford
,
I
am
quite
pleased
;
let
me
give
you
joy
,
dear
madam
,
if
it
be
so
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
they
all
said
,
and
saluted
me
all
round
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
vexed
<EOS>
it
was
before
Mrs.
Jewkes
;
for
she
shook
her
fat
sides
,
and
seemed
highly
pleased
to
be
a
means
of
discovering
it
.
  
<EOS>
Nobody
,
said
my
master
,
wishes
me
joy
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
said
Lady
Jones
,
very
obligingly
,
nobody
need
;
for
,
with
such
a
peerless
spouse
,
you
want
no
good
wishes
:
 
<EOS>
And
he
saluted
them
;
and
when
he
came
last
to
me
,
said
,
before
them
all
,
Now
,
my
sweet
bride
,
my
Pamela
,
let
me
conclude
with
you
;
for
here
I
began
to
love
,
and
here
I
desire
to
end
loving
,
but
not
till
my
life
ends
.
  
<EOS>
This
was
sweetly
said
,
and
taken
great
notice
of
;
and
it
was
doing
credit
to
his
own
generous
choice
,
and
vastly
more
than
I
merited
.
  
<EOS>
But
I
was
forced
to
stand
many
more
jokes
afterwards
:
For
Sir
Simon
said
,
several
times
,
Come
,
come
,
madam
,
now
you
are
become
one
of
us
,
I
shall
be
a
little
less
scrupulous
than
I
have
been
,
I
'll
assure
you
.
  
<EOS>
When
we
came
in
to
dinner
,
I
made
no
difficulty
of
what
all
offered
me
,
the
upper
end
of
the
table
;
and
performed
the
honours
of
it
with
pretty
tolerable
presence
of
mind
,
considering
.
 
<EOS>
And
,
with
much
ado
,
my
good
benefactor
promising
to
be
down
again
before
winter
,
we
got
off
the
ball
;
but
appointed
Tuesday
evening
,
at
Lady
Darnford
's
,
to
take
leave
of
all
this
good
company
,
who
promised
to
be
there
,
my
master
designing
to
set
out
on
Wednesday
morning
for
Bedfordshire
.
  
<EOS>
We
had
prayers
in
the
little
chapel
,
in
the
afternoon
;
but
they
all
wished
for
the
good
clerk
again
,
with
great
encomiums
upon
you
,
my
dear
father
;
and
the
company
staid
supper
also
,
and
departed
exceeding
well
satisfied
,
and
with
abundance
of
wishes
for
the
continuance
of
our
mutual
happiness
;
and
my
master
desired
Mr.
Peters
to
answer
for
him
to
the
ringers
at
the
town
,
if
they
should
hear
of
it
;
till
our
return
into
this
country
;
and
that
then
he
would
be
bountiful
to
them
,
because
he
would
not
publicly
declare
it
till
he
had
first
done
so
in
Bedfordshire
.
  
<EOS>
Monday
,
the
fifth
day
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
had
very
little
of
my
dear
friend
's
company
this
day
;
for
he
only
staid
breakfast
with
me
,
and
rode
out
to
see
a
sick
gentleman
about
eighteen
miles
off
,
who
begged
(
by
a
man
and
horse
on
purpose
)
to
speak
with
him
,
believing
he
should
not
recover
,
and
upon
part
of
whose
estate
my
master
has
a
mortgage
.
 
<EOS>
He
said
,
My
dearest
,
I
shall
be
very
uneasy
,
if
I
am
obliged
to
tarry
all
night
from
you
;
but
,
lest
you
should
be
alarmed
,
<EOS>
if
I
do
n't
come
home
by
ten
,
do
n't
expect
me
:
For
poor
Mr.
Carlton
and
I
have
pretty
large
concerns
together
;
and
if
he
should
be
very
ill
,
and
would
be
comforted
by
my
presence
,
(
as
I
know
he
loves
me
,
and
his
family
will
be
more
in
my
power
,
if
he
dies
,
than
I
wish
for
,
)
charity
will
not
let
me
refuse
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
now
ten
o'clock
at
night
,
and
I
fear
he
will
not
return
.
 
<EOS>
I
fear
,
for
the
sake
of
his
poor
sick
friend
,
who
,
I
doubt
,
is
worse
.
 
<EOS>
Though
I
know
not
the
gentleman
,
I
am
sorry
for
his
own
sake
,
for
his
family
's
sake
,
and
for
my
dear
master
's
sake
,
who
,
by
his
kind
expressions
,
I
find
,
loves
him
:
<EOS>
And
,
methinks
,
I
should
be
sorry
any
grief
should
touch
his
generous
heart
;
though
yet
there
is
no
living
in
this
world
,
without
too
many
occasions
for
concern
,
even
in
the
most
prosperous
state
.
 
<EOS>
And
it
is
fit
it
should
be
so
;
or
else
<EOS>
,
poor
wretches
,
as
we
are
!
<EOS>
we
should
look
no
farther
,
but
be
like
sensual
travellers
on
a
journey
homeward
,
who
,
meeting
with
good
entertainment
at
some
inn
on
the
way
,
put
up
their
rest
there
,
and
never
think
of
pursuing
their
journey
to
their
proper
home
.
 
<EOS>
This
,
I
remember
,
was
often
a
reflection
of
my
good
lady
's
,
to
whom
I
owe
it
.
  
<EOS>
Eleven
o'clock
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
has
been
with
me
,
and
asked
if
I
will
have
her
for
a
bed
-
fellow
,
in
want
of
a
better
?
 
<EOS>
I
thanked
her
;
but
I
said
,
I
would
see
how
it
was
to
be
by
myself
one
night
.
  
<EOS>
I
might
have
mentioned
,
that
I
made
Mrs.
Jewkes
dine
and
sup
with
me
;
and
she
was
much
pleased
with
it
,
and
my
behaviour
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
could
see
,
by
her
manner
,
that
she
was
a
little
struck
inwardly
at
some
of
her
former
conduct
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
poor
wretch
!
<EOS>
it
is
much
,
I
fear
,
because
I
am
what
I
am
;
for
she
has
otherwise
very
little
remorse
,
I
doubt
.
 
<EOS>
Her
talk
and
actions
are
entirely
different
from
what
they
used
to
be
,
quite
circumspect
and
decent
;
and
I
should
have
thought
her
virtuous
,
and
even
pious
,
had
I
never
known
her
in
another
light
.
  
<EOS>
By
this
we
may
see
,
my
dear
father
and
mother
,
of
what
force
example
is
,
and
what
is
in
the
power
of
the
heads
of
families
to
do
:
And
this
shews
,
that
evil
examples
,
in
superiors
,
are
doubly
pernicious
,
and
doubly
culpable
,
because
such
persons
are
bad
themselves
,
and
not
only
do
no
good
,
but
much
harm
to
others
;
and
the
condemnation
of
such
must
,
to
be
sure
,
be
so
much
the
greater
!
 
<EOS>
And
how
much
the
greater
still
must
my
condemnation
be
,
who
have
had
such
a
religious
education
under
you
,
and
been
so
well
nurtured
by
my
good
lady
,
if
I
should
forget
,
with
all
these
mercies
heaped
upon
me
,
<EOS>
what
belongs
to
the
station
I
am
preferred
to
!
 
<EOS>
O
how
I
long
to
be
doing
some
good
!
 
<EOS>
For
all
that
is
past
yet
,
is
my
dear
,
dear
master
's
,
God
bless
him
!
<EOS>
and
return
him
safe
to
my
wishes
!
<EOS>
for
methinks
,
already
,
'
tis
a
week
since
I
saw
him
.
 
<EOS>
If
my
love
would
not
be
troublesome
and
impertinent
,
I
should
be
nothing
else
;
for
I
have
a
true
grateful
spirit
;
and
I
had
need
to
have
such
a
one
,
for
I
am
poor
in
every
thing
but
will
.
  
<EOS>
Tuesday
morning
,
eleven
o'clock
.
  
<EOS>
My
dear
,
dear
 
master
(
I
'm
sure
I
should
still
say
;
<EOS>
but
I
will
learn
to
rise
to
a
softer
epithet
,
now
-
and
-
then
)
is
not
yet
come
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
he
is
safe
and
well
!
 
<EOS>
So
Mrs.
Jewkes
and
<EOS>
I
went
to
breakfast
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
can
do
nothing
but
talk
and
think
of
him
,
and
all
his
kindness
to
me
,
and
to
you
,
which
is
still
me
,
more
intimately
!
 
<EOS>
I
have
just
received
a
letter
from
him
,
which
he
wrote
overnight
,
as
I
find
by
it
,
and
sent
early
this
morning
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
a
copy
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
TO
MRS
.
<EOS>
ANDREWS
  
"
<EOS>
MY
DEAREST
PAMELA
,
                             
Monday
night
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
my
not
coming
home
this
night
will
not
frighten
you
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
believe
I
ca
n't
help
it
.
 
<EOS>
My
poor
friend
is
so
very
ill
,
<EOS>
that
I
doubt
he
ca
n't
recover
.
 
<EOS>
His
desires
to
have
me
stay
with
him
are
so
strong
,
that
I
shall
sit
up
all
night
with
him
,
as
it
is
now
near
one
o'clock
in
the
morning
;
for
he
ca
n't
bear
me
out
of
his
sight
:
<EOS>
And
I
have
made
him
and
his
distressed
wife
and
children
so
easy
,
in
the
kindest
assurances
I
could
give
him
of
my
consideration
for
him
and
them
,
that
I
am
looked
upon
(
as
the
poor
disconsolate
widow
,
as
she
,
I
doubt
,
will
soon
be
,
tells
me
,
)
as
their
good
angel
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
have
wished
we
had
not
engaged
to
the
good
neighbourhood
at
Sir
Simon
's
for
to
-
morrow
night
;
but
I
am
so
desirous
to
set
out
on
Wednesday
for
the
other
house
,
that
,
as
well
as
in
return
for
the
civilities
of
so
many
good
friends
,
who
will
be
there
on
purpose
,
I
would
not
put
it
off
.
 
<EOS>
What
I
beg
of
you
,
therefore
,
my
dear
,
is
,
that
you
would
go
in
the
chariot
to
Sir
Simon
's
,
the
sooner
in
the
day
the
better
,
because
you
will
be
diverted
with
the
company
,
who
all
so
much
admire
you
;
and
I
hope
to
join
you
there
by
your
tea
-
time
in
the
afternoon
,
which
will
be
better
than
going
home
,
and
returning
with
you
,
as
it
will
be
six
miles
difference
to
me
;
and
I
know
the
good
company
will
excuse
my
dress
,
on
the
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
I
count
every
hour
of
this
little
absence
for
a
day
:
for
I
am
,
with
the
utmost
sincerity
,
                                 
"
<EOS>
My
dearest
love
,
for
ever
yours
,
etc
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
could
go
to
dine
with
them
,
it
will
be
a
freedom
that
would
be
very
pleasing
to
them
;
and
the
more
,
as
they
do
n't
expect
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
begin
to
have
a
little
concern
,
lest
his
fatigue
should
be
too
great
,
and
for
the
poor
sick
gentleman
and
family
;
but
told
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
that
the
least
intimation
of
his
choice
should
be
a
command
to
me
,
and
so
I
would
go
to
dinner
there
;
and
ordered
the
chariot
to
be
got
ready
to
carry
me
:
when
a
messenger
came
up
,
just
as
I
was
dressed
,
to
tell
her
she
must
come
down
immediately
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
at
the
window
,
that
visitors
are
come
;
for
there
is
a
chariot
and
six
horses
,
the
company
gone
out
of
it
,
and
three
footmen
on
horseback
;
and
I
think
the
chariot
has
coronets
.
<EOS>
Who
can
it
be
,
I
wonder
?
 
<EOS>
But
here
I
will
stop
,
for
I
suppose
I
shall
soon
know
.
  
<EOS>
Good
sirs
!
<EOS>
how
unlucky
this
is
!
 
<EOS>
What
shall
I
do
!
 
<EOS>
Here
is
Lady
Davers
come
,
her
own
self
!
<EOS>
and
my
kind
protector
a
great
,
great
many
miles
off
!
  
<EOS>
M
rs
.
<EOS>
Jewkes
,
out
of
breath
,
comes
and
tells
me
this
,
and
says
,
she
is
inquiring
for
my
master
and
me
.
 
<EOS>
She
asked
her
,
it
seemed
,
naughty
lady
as
she
is
,
if
I
was
whored
yet
!
 
<EOS>
There
's
a
word
for
a
lady
's
mouth
!
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
says
,
she
knew
not
what
to
answer
.
 
<EOS>
And
my
lady
said
,
<EOS>
She
is
not
married
,
I
hope
?
 
<EOS>
And
said
she
<EOS>
,
I
said
,
<EOS>
No
:
because
you
have
not
owned
it
yet
publicly
.
 
<EOS>
My
lady
said
,
That
was
well
enough
.
 
<EOS>
Said
I
<EOS>
,
I
will
run
away
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
;
and
let
the
chariot
go
to
the
bottom
of
the
elm
-
walk
,
and
I
will
steal
out
of
the
door
unperceived
:
<EOS>
But
she
is
inquiring
for
you
,
madam
,
replied
she
,
and
I
said
you
was
within
,
but
going
out
;
and
she
said
,
she
would
see
you
presently
,
as
soon
as
she
could
have
patience
.
 
<EOS>
What
did
she
call
me
?
<EOS>
said
I.
 
<EOS>
The
creature
,
madam
<EOS>
;
I
will
see
the
creature
,
said
she
,
as
soon
as
I
can
have
patience
.
 
<EOS>
Ay
,
but
,
said
I
,
the
creature
wo
n't
let
her
,
if
she
can
help
it
.
  
<EOS>
Pray
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
favour
my
escape
,
for
this
once
;
for
I
am
sadly
frighted
.
 
<EOS>
Said
she
<EOS>
,
I
'll
bid
the
chariot
go
down
,
as
you
order
,
and
wait
till
you
come
;
and
I
'll
step
down
and
shut
the
hall
door
,
that
you
may
pass
unobserved
;
for
she
sits
cooling
herself
in
the
parlour
,
over
against
the
staircase
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
a
good
Mrs.
Jewkes
!
<EOS>
said
I
:
<EOS>
But
who
has
she
with
her
?
 
<EOS>
Her
woman
,
answered
she
,
and
her
nephew
;
but
he
came
on
horseback
,
and
is
going
into
the
stables
;
and
they
have
three
footmen
.
  
<EOS>
And
I
wish
,
said
I
,
they
were
all
three
hundred
miles
off
!
 
<EOS>
What
shall
I
do
?
 
<EOS>
So
I
wrote
thus
far
,
and
wait
impatiently
to
hear
the
coast
is
clear
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
tells
me
I
must
come
down
,
or
she
will
come
up
.
 
<EOS>
What
does
she
call
me
now
?
<EOS>
said
I.
 
Wench
,
madam
,
Bid
<EOS>
the
wench
come
down
to
me
.
<EOS>
And
her
nephew
and
her
woman
are
with
her
.
  
<EOS>
Said
I
,
I
ca
n't
go
,
and
that
's
enough
!
 
<EOS>
You
might
contrive
it
that
I
might
get
out
,
if
you
would
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
madam
,
said
she
,
I
can
not
;
for
I
went
to
shut
the
door
,
and
she
bid
me
let
it
stand
open
;
and
there
she
sits
over
against
the
staircase
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
said
I
,
I
'll
get
out
of
the
window
,
I
think
!
 
<EOS>
(
And
fanned
myself
;
)
for
I
am
sadly
frightened
.
 
<EOS>
Laud
,
madam
,
said
she
,
I
wonder
you
so
much
disturb
yourself
!
 
<EOS>
You
're
on
the
right
side
the
hedge
<EOS>
,
I
'm
sure
;
and
I
would
not
be
so
discomposed
for
any
body
.
 
<EOS>
Ay
,
said
I
,
but
who
can
help
constitution
?
 
<EOS>
I
dare
say
you
would
no
more
be
so
discomposed
,
that
I
can
help
it
.
 
<EOS>
Said
she
,
Indeed
,
madam
,
if
it
was
to
me
,
I
would
put
on
an
air
as
mistress
of
the
house
,
as
you
are
,
and
go
and
salute
her
ladyship
,
and
bid
her
welcome
.
 
<EOS>
Ay
,
ay
,
replied
I
,
fine
talking
!
 
<EOS>
But
how
unlucky
this
is
,
your
good
master
is
not
at
home
!
  
<EOS>
What
answer
shall
I
give
her
,
said
she
,
to
her
desiring
to
see
you
?
 
<EOS>
Tell
her
,
said
I
,
I
am
sick
a
-
bed
;
I
'm
dying
,
and
must
not
be
disturbed
;
I
'm
gone
out
 
or
any
thing
.
  
<EOS>
But
her
woman
came
up
to
me
just
as
I
had
uttered
this
,
and
said
,
How
do
you
do
,
Mrs.
Pamela
?
 
<EOS>
My
lady
desires
to
speak
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
must
go
.
  
<EOS>
Sure
she
wo
n't
beat
me
!
 
<EOS>
Oh
that
my
dear
protector
was
at
home
!
  
<EOS>
Well
,
now
I
will
tell
you
all
that
happened
in
this
frightful
interview
.
  
<EOS>
A
nd
very
bad
it
was
.
  
<EOS>
I
went
down
,
dressed
as
I
was
,
and
my
gloves
on
,
and
my
fan
in
my
hand
,
to
be
just
ready
to
step
into
the
chariot
,
when
I
could
get
away
;
and
I
thought
all
my
trembling
fits
had
been
over
now
;
but
I
was
mistaken
;
for
I
trembled
sadly
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
resolved
to
put
on
as
good
an
air
as
I
could
.
  
<EOS>
So
I
went
to
the
parlour
,
and
said
,
making
a
very
low
courtesy
,
Your
servant
,
my
good
lady
!
 
<EOS>
And
your
servant
again
,
said
she
,
my
lady
,
for
I
think
you
are
dressed
out
like
one
.
  
<EOS>
A
charming
girl
,
though
!
<EOS>
said
her
rakish
nephew
,
and
swore
a
great
oath
:
<EOS>
Dear
aunt
,
forgive
me
,
but
I
must
kiss
her
;
and
was
coming
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
said
,
Forbear
,
uncivil
gentleman
!
 
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
be
used
freely
.
 
<EOS>
Jackey
,
said
my
lady
,
sit
down
,
and
do
n't
touch
the
creature
 
<EOS>
She
's
proud
enough
already
.
 
<EOS>
There
's
a
great
difference
in
her
air
<EOS>
,
I
'll
assure
you
,
since
I
saw
her
last
.
  
<EOS>
Well
,
child
,
said
she
,
sneeringly
,
how
dost
find
thyself
?
 
<EOS>
Thou'rt
mightily
come
on
,
of
late
!
 
<EOS>
I
hear
strange
reports
about
thee
!
 
<EOS>
Thou'rt
almost
got
into
fool
's
paradise
,
I
doubt
!
 
<EOS>
And
wilt
find
thyself
terribly
mistaken
in
a
little
while
<EOS>
,
if
thou
thinkest
my
brother
will
disgrace
his
family
,
to
humour
thy
baby
-
face
!
  
<EOS>
I
see
,
said
I
,
sadly
vexed
,
(
her
woman
and
nephew
smiling
by
,
)
<EOS>
your
ladyship
has
no
very
important
commands
for
me
;
and
I
beg
leave
to
withdraw
.
 
<EOS>
Beck
,
said
she
to
her
woman
,
shut
the
door
,
my
young
lady
<EOS>
and
I
must
not
have
done
so
soon
.
  
<EOS>
Where
's
your
well
-
mannered
deceiver
gone
,
child
?
 
<EOS>
says
she
.
 
<EOS>
Said
I
,
When
your
ladyship
is
pleased
to
speak
intelligibly
,
I
shall
know
how
to
answer
.
  
<EOS>
Well
,
but
my
dear
child
,
said
she
,
in
drollery
,
do
n't
be
too
pert
<EOS>
neither
,
I
beseech
thee
.
 
<EOS>
Thou
wilt
not
find
thy
master
's
sister
half
so
ready
to
take
thy
freedoms
,
as
thy
mannerly
master
is
!
 
<EOS>
So
,
a
little
of
that
modesty
and
humility
that
my
mother
's
waiting
-
maid
used
to
shew
,
will
become
thee
better
than
the
airs
thou
givest
thyself
,
since
my
mother
's
son
has
taught
thee
to
forget
thyself
.
  
<EOS>
I
would
beg
,
said
I
,
one
favour
of
your
ladyship
,
That
if
you
would
have
me
keep
my
distance
,
you
will
not
forget
your
own
degree
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
suppose
,
Miss
Pert
,
I
should
forget
my
degree
,
wouldst
thou
not
keep
thy
distance
then
?
  
<EOS>
If
you
,
madam
,
said
I
,
lessen
the
distance
yourself
<EOS>
,
you
will
descend
to
my
level
,
and
make
an
equality
,
which
I
do
n't
presume
to
think
of
;
for
I
ca
n't
descend
lower
than
I
am
 
at
least
in
your
ladyship
's
esteem
!
  
<EOS>
Did
I
not
tell
you
,
Jackey
,
said
she
,
that
I
should
have
a
wit
to
talk
to
?
 
<EOS>
He
,
who
swears
like
a
fine
gentleman
at
every
word
,
rapped
out
an
oath
,
and
said
,
drolling
,
I
think
,
Mrs.
Pamela
,
if
I
may
be
so
bold
as
to
say
so
<EOS>
,
you
should
know
you
are
speaking
to
Lady
Davers
!
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
said
I
,
I
hope
there
was
no
need
of
your
information
,
and
so
I
ca
n't
thank
you
for
it
;
and
am
sorry
you
seem
to
think
it
wants
an
oath
to
convince
me
of
the
truth
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
He
looked
more
foolish
than
I
,
at
this
,
if
possible
,
not
expecting
such
a
reprimand
.
 
<EOS>
And
said
,
at
last
,
Why
,
Mrs.
Pamela
,
you
put
me
half
out
of
countenance
with
your
witty
reproof
!
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
said
I
,
you
seem
quite
a
fine
gentleman
;
and
it
will
not
be
easily
done
,
I
dare
say
.
  
<EOS>
How
now
,
pert
one
,
said
my
lady
,
do
you
know
whom
you
talk
to
?
 
<EOS>
I
think
<EOS>
I
do
not
,
madam
,
replied
I
:
<EOS>
and
for
fear
I
should
forget
myself
more
,
I
'll
withdraw
.
 
<EOS>
Your
ladyship
's
servant
,
said
I
;
and
was
going
:
but
she
rose
,
and
gave
me
a
push
,
and
pulled
a
chair
,
and
,
setting
the
back
against
the
door
,
sat
down
in
it
.
  
<EOS>
Well
,
said
I
,
I
can
bear
anything
at
your
ladyship
's
hands
;
but
I
was
ready
to
cry
though
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
went
,
and
sat
down
,
and
fanned
myself
,
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
Her
woman
,
who
stood
all
the
time
,
said
softly
,
Mrs.
Pamela
,
you
should
not
sit
in
my
lady
's
presence
.
 
<EOS>
And
my
lady
,
though
she
did
not
hear
her
,
said
,
You
shall
sit
down
,
child
,
in
the
room
where
I
am
,
when
I
give
you
leave
.
  
<EOS>
So
I
stood
up
,
and
said
,
When
your
ladyship
will
hardly
permit
me
to
stand
,
one
might
be
indulged
to
sit
down
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
ask
you
,
said
she
,
Whither
your
master
is
gone
?
 
<EOS>
To
one
Mr.
Carlton
,
madam
,
about
eighteen
miles
off
,
who
is
very
sick
.
 
<EOS>
And
when
does
he
come
home
?
 
<EOS>
This
evening
,
madam
.
 
<EOS>
And
where
are
you
going
?
 
<EOS>
To
a
gentleman
's
house
in
the
town
,
madam
.
 
<EOS>
And
how
was
you
to
go
?
 
<EOS>
In
the
chariot
,
madam
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
you
must
be
a
lady
in
time
,
to
be
sure
!
 
<EOS>
I
believe
you
'd
become
a
chariot
mighty
well
,
child
!
 
<EOS>
Was
you
ever
out
in
it
with
your
master
?
  
<EOS>
Pray
,
your
ladyship
,
said
I
,
a
little
too
pertly
,
perhaps
,
be
pleased
to
ask
half
a
dozen
such
questions
together
;
because
one
answer
may
do
for
all
!
 
<EOS>
Why
,
bold
-
face
,
said
she
,
you
'll
forget
your
distance
,
and
bring
me
to
your
level
before
my
time
.
  
<EOS>
I
could
no
longer
refrain
tears
,
but
said
,
Pray
your
ladyship
,
let
me
ask
what
I
have
done
,
to
be
thus
severely
treated
?
 
<EOS>
I
never
did
your
ladyship
any
harm
.
 
<EOS>
And
if
you
think
I
am
deceived
,
as
you
was
pleased
to
hint
,
I
should
be
more
entitled
to
your
pity
,
than
your
anger
.
  
<EOS>
She
rose
,
and
took
me
by
the
hand
,
and
led
me
to
her
chair
;
and
then
sat
down
;
and
still
holding
my
hand
,
said
,
Why
Pamela
,
I
did
indeed
pity
you
while
I
thought
you
innocent
;
and
when
my
brother
seized
you
,
and
brought
you
down
hither
,
without
your
consent
,
I
was
concerned
for
you
;
and
I
was
still
more
concerned
for
you
,
and
loved
you
,
when
I
heard
of
your
virtue
and
resistance
,
and
your
laudable
efforts
to
get
away
from
him
.
 
<EOS>
But
when
,
as
I
fear
,
you
have
suffered
yourself
to
be
prevailed
upon
,
and
have
lost
your
innocence
,
and
added
another
to
the
number
of
the
fools
he
has
ruined
,
(
This
shocked
me
a
little
,
)
<EOS>
I
can
not
help
shewing
my
displeasure
to
you
.
  
<EOS>
Madam
,
replied
I
,
I
must
beg
no
hasty
judgment
;
I
have
not
lost
my
innocence
.
 
<EOS>
Take
care
,
take
care
,
Pamela
!
<EOS>
said
she
:
do
n't
lose
your
veracity
,
as
well
as
your
honour
!
 
<EOS>
Why
are
you
here
,
when
you
are
at
full
liberty
to
go
whither
you
please
?
 
<EOS>
I
will
make
one
proposal
to
you
,
and
if
you
are
innocent
,
I
am
sure
you
'll
accept
it
.
 
<EOS>
Will
you
go
and
live
with
me
?
 
<EOS>
I
will
instantly
set
out
with
you
in
my
chariot
,
and
not
stay
half
an
hour
longer
in
this
house
,
if
you
'll
go
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
if
you
are
innocent
,
and
willing
to
keep
so
,
deny
me
,
if
you
can
.
  
<EOS>
I
am
innocent
,
madam
,
replied
I
,
and
willing
to
keep
so
;
and
yet
I
can
not
consent
to
this
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
said
she
,
very
mannerly
,
Thou
liest
,
child
,
that
's
all
:
and
I
give
thee
up
!
  
<EOS>
And
so
she
arose
,
and
walked
about
the
room
in
great
wrath
.
 
<EOS>
Her
nephew
and
her
woman
said
,
Your
ladyship
's
very
good
;
'
tis
a
plain
case
;
a
very
plain
case
!
  
<EOS>
I
would
have
removed
the
chair
,
to
have
gone
out
;
but
her
nephew
came
and
sat
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
This
provoked
me
;
for
I
thought
I
should
be
unworthy
of
the
honour
I
was
raised
to
,
though
I
was
afraid
to
own
it
,
if
I
did
not
shew
some
spirit
;
and
I
said
,
What
,
sir
,
is
your
pretence
in
this
house
,
to
keep
me
a
prisoner
here
?
 
<EOS>
Because
,
said
he
 
<EOS>
I
like
it
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
so
,
sir
?
<EOS>
replied
I
<EOS>
:
if
that
is
the
answer
of
a
gentleman
to
such
an
one
as
I
,
it
would
not
,
I
dare
say
,
be
the
answer
of
a
gentleman
to
a
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
My
lady
!
<EOS>
my
lady
!
<EOS>
said
he
,
a
challenge
,
a
challenge
,
by
gad
!
 
<EOS>
No
,
sir
,
said
I
,
I
am
of
a
sex
that
gives
no
challenges
;
and
you
think
so
too
,
or
you
would
not
give
this
occasion
for
the
word
.
  
<EOS>
Said
my
lady
,
Do
n't
be
surprised
,
nephew
<EOS>
;
the
wench
could
not
talk
thus
,
if
she
had
not
been
her
master
's
bed
-
fellow
.
 
<EOS>
Pamela
,
Pamela
,
said
she
,
and
tapped
me
upon
the
shoulder
two
or
three
times
,
in
anger
,
thou
hast
lost
thy
innocence
,
girl
;
and
thou
hast
got
some
of
thy
bold
master
's
assurance
,
and
art
fit
to
go
<EOS>
any
where
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
and
please
your
ladyship
<EOS>
,
said
I
,
I
am
unworthy
of
your
presence
,
and
desire
<EOS>
I
may
quit
it
.
  
<EOS>
No
,
replied
she
<EOS>
,
I
will
know
first
what
reason
you
can
give
for
not
accepting
my
proposal
,
if
you
are
innocent
?
 
<EOS>
I
can
give
,
said
I
,
a
very
good
one
:
<EOS>
but
I
beg
to
be
excused
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
hear
it
,
said
she
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
then
,
answered
I
,
I
should
perhaps
have
less
reason
to
like
this
gentleman
,
than
where
I
am
.
  
<EOS>
Well
then
,
said
she
,
I
'll
put
you
to
another
trial
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
set
out
this
moment
with
you
to
your
father
and
mother
,
and
give
you
up
safe
to
them
.
<EOS>
What
do
you
say
to
that
?
 
<EOS>
Ay
,
Mrs.
Pamela
,
said
her
nephew
,
now
what
does
your
innocence
say
to
that
?
 
<EOS>
"
Fore
gad
,
madam
,
you
have
puzzled
her
now
.
  
<EOS>
Be
pleased
,
madam
,
said
I
,
to
call
off
this
fine
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
Your
kindness
in
these
proposals
makes
me
think
you
would
not
have
me
baited
.
<EOS>
I
'll
be
d####d
,
said
he
,
if
she
does
not
make
me
a
bull
-
dog
!
 
<EOS>
Why
she
'll
toss
us
all
by
and
by
!
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
said
I
,
you
indeed
behave
as
if
you
were
in
a
bear
-
garden
.
  
<EOS>
Jackey
,
be
quiet
,
said
my
lady
.
 
<EOS>
You
only
give
her
a
pretence
to
evade
my
questions
.
 
<EOS>
Come
,
answer
me
,
Pamela
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
,
madam
,
said
I
,
and
it
is
thus
:
I
have
no
occasion
to
be
beholden
to
your
ladyship
for
this
honour
;
for
I
am
to
set
out
to
-
morrow
morning
on
the
way
to
my
parents
.
 
<EOS>
Now
again
thou
liest
,
wench
!
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
of
quality
,
said
I
,
to
answer
such
language
.
 
<EOS>
Once
again
,
said
she
,
provoke
me
not
,
by
these
reflections
,
and
this
pertness
;
if
thou
dost
,
I
shall
do
something
by
thee
unworthy
of
myself
.
 
<EOS>
That
,
thought
I
,
you
have
done
already
;
but
I
ventured
not
to
say
so
.
 
<EOS>
But
who
is
to
carry
you
,
said
she
,
to
your
father
and
mother
?
<EOS>
Who
my
master
pleases
,
madam
,
said
I.
 
Ay
,
said
she
,
<EOS>
I
doubt
not
thou
wilt
<EOS>
do
every
thing
he
pleases
,
if
thou
hast
not
already
.
 
<EOS>
Why
now
tell
me
,
Pamela
,
from
thy
heart
,
hast
thou
not
been
in
bed
with
thy
master
?
<EOS>
Ha
,
wench
!
 
<EOS>
I
was
quite
shocked
at
this
,
and
said
,
I
wonder
how
your
ladyship
can
use
me
thus
!
 
<EOS>
I
am
sure
you
can
expect
no
answer
;
and
my
sex
,
and
my
tender
years
,
might
exempt
me
from
such
treatment
,
from
a
person
of
your
ladyship
's
birth
and
quality
,
and
who
,
be
the
distance
ever
so
great
,
is
of
the
same
sex
with
me
.
  
<EOS>
Thou
art
a
confident
wench
,
said
she
,
I
see
!
 
<EOS>
Pray
,
madam
,
said
I
,
let
me
beg
you
to
permit
me
to
go
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
waited
for
in
the
town
,
to
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
replied
she
<EOS>
,
I
ca
n't
spare
you
;
and
whomsoever
you
are
to
go
to
,
will
excuse
you
,
when
they
are
told
'
tis
I
that
command
you
not
to
go
;
 
and
you
may
excuse
it
too
,
young
Lady
Would
-
be
,
if
you
consider
,
that
it
is
the
unexpected
coming
of
your
late
lady
's
daughter
,
and
your
master
's
sister
,
that
commands
your
stay
.
  
<EOS>
But
a
pre
-
engagement
,
your
ladyship
will
consider
,
is
something
.
 
<EOS>
Ay
,
so
it
is
;
but
I
know
not
what
reason
<EOS>
waiting
-
maids
have
to
assume
these
airs
of
pre
-
engagements
!
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
Pamela
,
Pamela
,
I
am
sorry
for
thy
thus
aping
thy
betters
,
and
giving
thyself
such
airs
:
I
see
thou'rt
quite
spoiled
!
<EOS>
Of
a
modest
,
innocent
girl
,
that
thou
wast
,
and
humble
too
,
thou
art
now
fit
for
nothing
in
the
world
,
but
what
I
fear
thou
art
.
  
<EOS>
Why
,
please
your
ladyship
,
said
her
kinsman
,
what
signifies
all
you
say
?
<EOS>
The
matter
's
over
with
her
,
no
doubt
;
and
she
likes
it
;
and
she
is
in
a
fairy
-
dream
,
and
'
tis
pity
to
awaken
her
before
her
dream
's
out
.
 
<EOS>
Bad
as
you
take
me
to
be
,
madam
,
said
I
,
I
am
not
used
to
such
language
or
reflections
as
this
gentleman
bestows
upon
me
;
and
I
wo
n't
bear
it
.
  
<EOS>
Well
,
Jackey
,
said
she
,
be
silent
;
and
,
shaking
her
head
,
Poor
girl
!
  
<EOS>
said
she
 
<EOS>
what
a
sweet
innocence
is
here
destroyed
!
 
<EOS>
A
thousand
pities
!
  
<EOS>
I
could
cry
over
her
,
if
that
would
do
her
good
!
 
<EOS>
But
she
is
quite
lost
,
quite
undone
;
and
then
has
assumed
a
carriage
upon
it
,
that
all
those
creatures
are
distinguished
by
!
  
<EOS>
I
cried
sadly
for
vexation
;
and
said
,
Say
what
you
please
,
madam
;
if
I
can
help
it
,
I
will
not
answer
another
word
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
came
in
,
and
asked
if
her
ladyship
was
ready
for
dinner
?
 
<EOS>
She
said
,
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
have
gone
out
with
her
<EOS>
but
my
lady
said
,
taking
my
hand
,
she
could
not
spare
me
.
 
<EOS>
And
,
miss
<EOS>
,
said
she
,
you
may
pull
off
your
gloves
,
and
lay
your
fan
by
,
for
you
sha
n't
go
;
and
,
if
you
behave
well
,
you
shall
wait
upon
me
at
dinner
,
and
then
I
shall
have
a
little
further
talk
with
you
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
said
to
me
,
Madam
,
may
I
speak
one
word
with
you
?
 
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
tell
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
said
I
;
for
my
lady
holds
my
hand
,
and
you
see
I
am
a
kind
of
prisoner
.
  
<EOS>
What
you
have
to
say
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
said
she
,
you
may
speak
before
me
.
<EOS>
But
she
went
out
,
and
seemed
vexed
for
me
;
and
she
says
,
I
looked
like
the
very
scarlet
.
  
<EOS>
The
cloth
was
laid
in
another
parlour
,
and
for
three
persons
,
and
she
led
me
in
:
<EOS>
Come
,
my
little
dear
,
said
she
,
with
a
sneer
,
I
'll
hand
you
in
;
and
I
would
have
you
think
it
as
well
as
if
it
was
my
brother
.
  
<EOS>
What
a
sad
case
,
thought
I
,
should
I
be
in
,
if
I
were
as
naughty
as
she
thinks
me
!
 
<EOS>
It
was
bad
enough
as
it
was
.
  
<EOS>
Jackey
,
said
my
lady
,
come
,
let
us
go
to
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
She
said
to
her
woman
,
Do
you
,
Beck
,
help
Pamela
to
"
tend
us
;
we
will
have
no
men
-
fellows
.
  
<EOS>
Come
,
my
young
lady
,
shall
I
help
you
off
with
your
white
gloves
?
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
,
madam
,
said
I
,
deserved
this
at
your
ladyship
's
hands
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
coming
in
with
the
first
dish
,
she
said
,
Do
you
expect
any
body
else
<EOS>
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
that
you
lay
the
cloth
for
three
?
said
she
,
I
hoped
your
ladyship
and
madam
would
have
been
so
well
reconciled
,
that
she
would
have
sat
down
too
.
 
<EOS>
What
means
the
clownish
woman
?
<EOS>
said
my
lady
,
in
great
disdain
:
Could
you
think
the
creature
should
sit
down
with
me
?
 
<EOS>
She
does
,
madam
,
and
please
your
ladyship
,
with
my
master
.
 
<EOS>
I
doubt
it
not
<EOS>
,
good
woman
,
said
she
,
and
lies
with
him
too
<EOS>
,
does
she
not
?
<EOS>
Answer
me
,
fat
-
face
!
 
<EOS>
How
these
ladies
are
privileged
.
  
<EOS>
If
she
does
,
madam
,
said
she
,
there
may
be
a
reason
for
it
,
perhaps
!
<EOS>
and
went
out
.
 
<EOS>
So
!
<EOS>
said
she
,
has
the
wench
got
thee
over
too
?
 
<EOS>
Come
,
my
little
dear
,
pull
off
thy
gloves
,
I
say
;
and
off
she
pulled
my
left
glove
herself
,
and
spied
my
ring
.
 
<EOS>
O
my
dear
God
!
<EOS>
said
she
,
if
the
wench
has
not
got
a
ring
!
 
<EOS>
Well
,
this
is
a
pretty
piece
of
foolery
,
indeed
!
 
<EOS>
Dost
know
,
my
friend
,
that
thou
art
miserably
tricked
?
 
<EOS>
And
so
,
poor
innocent
,
thou
hast
made
a
fine
exchange
,
<EOS>
hast
thou
not
?
 
<EOS>
Thy
honesty
for
this
bauble
?
 
<EOS>
And
,
I
'll
warrant
,
<EOS>
my
little
dear
has
topped
her
part
,
and
paraded
it
like
any
real
wife
;
and
so
mimics
still
the
condition
!
 
<EOS>
Why
,
said
she
,
and
turned
me
round
,
thou
art
as
mincing
as
any
bride
!
 
<EOS>
No
wonder
thou
art
thus
tricked
out
,
and
talkest
of
thy
pre
-
engagements
!
<EOS>
Pr'ythee
,
child
,
walk
before
me
to
that
glass
;
survey
thyself
,
and
cone
back
to
me
,
that
I
may
see
how
finely
thou
can'st
act
the
theatrical
part
given
thee
!
  
<EOS>
I
was
then
resolved
to
try
to
be
silent
,
although
most
sadly
vexed
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
went
and
sat
me
down
in
the
window
,
and
she
took
her
place
at
the
upper
end
of
the
table
;
and
her
saucy
Jackey
,
fleering
at
me
most
provokingly
,
sat
down
by
her
.
 
<EOS>
Said
he
,
Shall
not
the
bride
sit
down
by
us
,
madam
?
<EOS>
Ay
,
well
thought
of
!
<EOS>
said
my
lady
:
<EOS>
Pray
,
Mrs.
Bride
,
your
pardon
for
sitting
down
in
your
place
!
 
<EOS>
I
said
nothing
.
  
<EOS>
Said
she
,
with
a
poor
pun
,
Thou
hast
some
modesty
,
however
,
child
!
<EOS>
for
<EOS>
thou
can'st
not
stand
it
,
so
must
sit
down
,
though
in
my
presence
!
 
<EOS>
I
still
kept
my
seat
,
and
said
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
Thought
<EOS>
I
,
this
is
a
sad
thing
,
that
I
am
hindered
too
from
shewing
my
duty
where
it
is
most
due
,
and
shall
have
anger
there
too
,
<EOS>
may
be
,
if
my
dear
master
should
be
there
before
me
!
 
<EOS>
So
she
ate
some
soup
,
as
did
her
kinsman
;
and
then
,
as
she
was
cutting
up
a
fowl
,
said
,
If
thou
longest
,
my
little
dear
,
I
will
help
thee
to
a
pinion
,
or
breast
,
or
any
thing
.
 
<EOS>
But
may
be
,
child
,
<EOS>
said
he
,
<EOS>
thou
likest
the
rump
;
shall
I
bring
it
thee
?
 
<EOS>
And
then
laughed
like
an
idiot
,
for
all
he
is
a
lord
's
son
,
and
may
be
a
lord
himself
.
 
<EOS>
For
he
is
the
son
of
Lord
#
#
#
#
;
 
and
his
mother
,
who
was
Lord
Davers
's
sister
,
being
dead
,
he
has
received
what
education
he
has
,
from
Lord
Davers
's
direction
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
wretch
!
<EOS>
for
all
his
greatness
!
<EOS>
he
'll
ne'er
die
for
a
plot
 
at
least
of
his
own
hatching
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
could
then
have
gone
up
,
I
would
have
given
you
his
picture
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
for
one
of
25
or
26
years
of
age
,
much
about
the
age
of
my
dear
master
,
he
is
a
most
odd
mortal
.
  
<EOS>
Pamela
,
said
my
lady
,
help
me
to
a
glass
of
wine
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
Beck
,
said
she
,
you
sha
n't
;
for
she
was
offering
to
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
have
my
lady
bride
confer
that
honour
upon
me
;
and
then
I
shall
see
if
she
can
stand
up
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
silent
,
and
never
stirred
.
  
<EOS>
Dost
hear
,
chastity
?
<EOS>
said
she
,
help
me
to
a
glass
of
wine
,
when
I
bid
thee
.
 
<EOS>
What
!
<EOS>
not
stir
?
 
<EOS>
Then
I
'll
come
and
help
thee
to
one
.
 
<EOS>
Still
I
stirred
not
,
and
,
fanning
myself
,
continued
silent
.
 
<EOS>
Said
she
<EOS>
,
When
I
have
asked
thee
,
meek
-
one
,
half
a
dozen
questions
together
,
I
suppose
thou
wilt
answer
them
all
at
once
!
 
<EOS>
Pretty
creature
,
is
not
that
it
?
  
<EOS>
I
was
so
vexed
<EOS>
,
I
bit
a
piece
of
my
fan
out
,
not
knowing
what
I
did
;
but
still
I
said
nothing
,
and
did
nothing
but
flutter
it
,
and
fan
myself
.
  
<EOS>
I
believe
,
said
she
,
my
next
question
will
make
up
half
a
dozen
;
and
then
,
modest
one
,
I
shall
be
entitled
to
an
answer
.
  
<EOS>
He
rose
and
brought
the
bottle
and
glass
;
<EOS>
Come
,
said
he
,
Mrs.
Bride
,
be
pleased
to
help
my
lady
,
and
I
will
be
your
deputy
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
replied
I
,
it
is
in
a
good
hand
;
help
my
lady
yourself
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
creature
,
said
she
,
dost
thou
think
thyself
above
it
?
 
<EOS>
And
then
flew
into
a
passion
:
 
Insolence
!
<EOS>
continued
she
,
<EOS>
this
moment
,
when
I
bid
you
,
know
your
duty
,
and
give
me
a
glass
of
wine
;
or
   
<EOS>
So
I
took
a
little
spirit
then
 
Thought
<EOS>
I
,
I
can
but
be
beat
.
 
<EOS>
If
,
said
I
,
to
attend
your
ladyship
at
table
,
or
even
kneel
at
your
feet
,
was
required
of
me
,
I
would
most
gladly
do
it
,
were
I
only
the
person
you
think
me
;
but
,
if
it
be
to
triumph
over
one
who
has
received
honours
,
that
she
thinks
require
her
to
act
another
part
,
not
to
be
utterly
unworthy
of
them
<EOS>
,
I
must
say
,
I
can
not
do
it
.
  
<EOS>
She
seemed
quite
surprised
,
and
looked
now
upon
her
kinsman
,
and
then
upon
her
woman
 
<EOS>
I
'm
astonished
 
quite
astonished
!
 
<EOS>
Well
,
then
,
I
suppose
you
would
have
me
conclude
you
my
brother
's
wife
;
could
you
not
?
  
<EOS>
Your
ladyship
,
said
I
,
compels
me
to
say
this
!
 
<EOS>
Well
,
returned
she
,
but
dost
thou
<EOS>
thyself
think
thou
art
<EOS>
so
?
 
<EOS>
Silence
,
said
her
kinsman
,
gives
consent
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
plain
enough
she
does
.
 
<EOS>
Shall
I
rise
,
madam
,
and
pay
my
duty
to
my
new
aunt
?
  
<EOS>
Tell
me
,
said
my
lady
,
what
,
in
the
name
of
impudence
,
possesses
thee
to
dare
to
look
upon
thyself
as
my
sister
?
 
<EOS>
Madam
,
replied
I
,
that
is
a
question
will
better
become
your
most
worthy
brother
to
answer
,
than
me
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
rising
in
great
wrath
:
but
her
woman
said
,
Good
your
ladyship
,
you
'll
do
yourself
more
harm
than
her
;
and
if
the
poor
girl
has
been
deluded
so
,
as
you
have
heard
,
with
the
sham
marriage
,
she
'll
be
more
deserving
of
your
ladyship
's
pity
than
anger
.
 
<EOS>
True
,
Beck
,
very
true
,
said
my
lady
;
but
there
's
no
bearing
the
impudence
of
the
creature
in
the
mean
time
.
  
<EOS>
I
would
have
gone
out
at
the
door
,
but
her
kinsman
ran
and
set
his
back
against
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
expected
bad
treatment
from
her
pride
,
and
violent
temper
;
but
this
was
worse
than
I
could
have
thought
of
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
said
to
him
,
Sir
,
when
my
master
comes
to
know
your
rude
behaviour
,
you
will
,
may
be
,
have
cause
to
repent
it
:
and
went
and
sat
down
in
the
window
again
.
  
<EOS>
Another
challenge
,
by
gad
!
said
he
;
but
I
am
glad
she
says
her
master
!
  
<EOS>
You
see
,
madam
<EOS>
,
she
herself
does
not
believe
she
is
married
,
and
so
has
not
been
so
much
deluded
as
you
think
for
:
<EOS>
And
,
coming
to
me
with
a
most
barbarous
air
of
insult
,
he
said
,
kneeling
on
one
knee
before
me
,
<EOS>
My
new
aunt
,
your
blessing
or
your
curse
<EOS>
,
I
care
not
which
;
but
quickly
give
me
one
or
other
,
that
I
may
not
lose
my
dinner
!
  
<EOS>
I
gave
him
a
most
contemptuous
look
:
Tinselled
toy
,
said
I
,
(
for
he
was
laced
all
over
)
,
<EOS>
twenty
or
thirty
years
hence
,
when
you
are
at
age
,
I
shall
know
how
to
answer
you
better
;
<EOS>
mean
time
,
sport
with
your
footman
,
and
not
with
me
!
<EOS>
and
so
I
removed
to
another
window
nearer
the
door
,
and
he
looked
like
a
sad
fool
,
as
he
is
.
  
<EOS>
Beck
,
Beck
,
said
my
lady
,
this
is
not
to
be
borne
!
 
<EOS>
Was
ever
the
like
heard
!
 
<EOS>
Is
my
kinsman
and
Lord
Davers
's
to
be
thus
used
by
such
a
slut
?
<EOS>
And
was
coming
to
me
:
<EOS>
And
indeed
I
began
to
be
afraid
;
for
I
have
but
<EOS>
a
poor
heart
,
after
all
.
 
<EOS>
But
Mrs.
Jewkes
hearing
high
words
,
came
in
again
,
with
the
second
course
,
and
said
,
Pray
your
ladyship
,
do
n't
so
discompose
yourself
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
afraid
this
day
's
business
will
make
matters
wider
than
ever
between
your
good
ladyship
and
your
brother
:
For
my
master
doats
upon
madam
.
  
<EOS>
Woman
,
said
she
,
do
thou
be
silent
!
 
<EOS>
Sure
,
I
that
was
born
in
this
house
,
may
have
some
privilege
in
it
,
without
being
talked
to
by
the
saucy
servants
in
it
!
  
<EOS>
I
beg
pardon
,
madam
,
replied
Mrs.
Jewkes
;
and
,
turning
to
me
,
said
,
Madam
,
my
master
will
take
it
very
ill
if
you
make
him
wait
for
you
thus
.
<EOS>
So
I
rose
to
go
out
;
but
my
lady
said
,
If
it
was
only
for
that
reason
she
sha
n't
go
.
 
<EOS>
And
went
to
the
door
and
shut
it
,
and
said
to
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
Woman
,
do
n't
come
again
till
I
call
you
;
and
coming
to
me
,
took
my
hand
,
and
said
,
Find
your
legs
,
miss
,
if
you
please
.
  
<EOS>
I
stood
up
,
and
she
tapped
my
cheek
!
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
says
she
,
that
scarlet
glow
shews
<EOS>
what
a
rancorous
little
heart
thou
hast
,
if
thou
durst
shew
it
!
<EOS>
but
come
this
way
;
and
so
led
me
to
her
chair
:
<EOS>
Stand
there
,
said
she
,
and
answer
me
a
few
questions
while
I
dine
,
and
I
'll
dismiss
thee
,
till
I
call
thy
impudent
master
to
account
;
and
then
I
'll
have
you
face
to
face
,
and
all
this
mystery
of
iniquity
shall
be
unravelled
;
for
,
between
you
,
I
will
come
to
the
bottom
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
When
she
had
sat
down
,
I
moved
to
the
window
on
the
other
side
of
the
parlour
,
looking
into
the
private
garden
;
and
her
woman
said
,
Mrs.
Pamela
,
do
n't
make
my
lady
angry
.
 
<EOS>
Stand
by
her
ladyship
,
as
she
bids
you
.
 
<EOS>
Said
I
,
Pray
,
good
<EOS>
now
,
let
it
suffice
you
to
attend
your
lady
's
commands
,
and
do
n't
lay
yours
upon
me
.
 
<EOS>
Your
pardon
,
sweet
Mrs.
Pamela
,
said
she
.
 
<EOS>
Times
are
much
altered
with
you
,
I
'll
assure
you
!
<EOS>
said
I
,
Her
ladyship
has
a
very
good
plea
to
be
free
in
the
house
that
she
was
born
in
;
but
you
may
as
well
confine
your
freedoms
to
the
house
in
which
you
had
your
breedings
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
how
now
,
Mrs.
Pamela
,
said
she
;
since
you
provoke
me
to
it
,
I
'll
tell
you
a
piece
of
my
mind
.
 
<EOS>
Hush
,
hush
,
good
woman
,
said
I
,
alluding
to
my
lady
's
language
to
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
my
lady
wants
not
your
assistance
:
 
<EOS>
Besides
,
I
ca
n't
scold
!
  
<EOS>
The
woman
was
ready
to
flutter
with
vexation
;
and
Lord
Jackey
laughed
as
if
he
would
burst
his
sides
:
<EOS>
G####d
<EOS>
d####n
me
,
Beck
,
said
he
,
you
'd
better
let
her
alone
to
my
lady
here
for
she
'll
be
too
many
for
twenty
such
as
you
and
I
!
 
<EOS>
And
then
he
laughed
again
,
and
repeated
 
I
ca
n't
scold
,
quoth
-
a
!
<EOS>
but
,
by
gad
,
miss
,
you
can
speak
d####d
spiteful
words
,
I
can
tell
you
that
!
 
<EOS>
Poor
Beck
,
poor
Beck
!
 
<EOS>
"
Fore
gad
,
she
's
quite
dumbfoundered
!
  
<EOS>
Well
,
but
Pamela
,
said
my
lady
,
come
hither
,
and
tell
me
truly
,
Dost
thou
think
thyself
really
married
?
 
<EOS>
Said
I
,
and
approached
her
chair
,
My
good
lady
,
I
'll
answer
all
your
commands
,
if
you
'll
have
patience
with
me
,
and
not
be
so
angry
as
you
are
:
<EOS>
But
I
ca
n't
bear
to
be
used
thus
by
this
gentleman
,
and
your
ladyship
's
woman
.
 
<EOS>
Child
,
said
she
,
thou
art
very
impertinent
to
my
kinsman
;
thou
can'st
not
be
civil
to
me
;
and
my
ladyship
's
woman
is
much
thy
betters
.
 
<EOS>
But
that
's
not
the
thing
!
 
<EOS>
Dost
thou
think
thou
art
really
married
?
  
<EOS>
I
see
,
madam
,
said
I
,
you
are
resolved
not
to
be
pleased
with
any
answer
I
shall
return
:
If
I
should
say
,
I
am
not
,
then
your
ladyship
will
call
me
hard
names
,
and
,
perhaps
,
I
should
tell
a
fib
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
should
say
,
I
am
,
your
ladyship
will
ask
,
how
I
have
the
impudence
to
be
so
?
 
and
will
call
it
a
sham
-
marriage
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
,
said
she
,
be
answered
more
directly
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
what
,
madam
,
does
it
signify
what
I
think
?
 
<EOS>
Your
ladyship
will
believe
as
you
please
.
  
<EOS>
But
can'st
thou
have
the
vanity
,
the
pride
,
the
folly
,
said
she
,
to
think
thyself
actually
married
to
my
brother
?
 
<EOS>
He
is
no
fool
,
child
;
and
libertine
enough
of
conscience
;
and
thou
art
not
the
first
in
the
list
of
his
credulous
harlots
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
well
,
said
I
,
(
and
was
in
a
sad
flutter
,
)
as
I
am
easy
,
and
pleased
with
my
lot
,
pray
,
madam
,
let
me
continue
so
,
as
long
as
I
can
.
 
<EOS>
It
will
be
time
enough
for
me
to
know
the
worst
,
when
the
worst
comes
.
 
<EOS>
And
if
it
should
be
so
bad
,
your
ladyship
should
pity
me
,
rather
than
thus
torment
me
before
my
time
.
  
<EOS>
Well
,
said
she
,
but
dost
not
think
I
am
concerned
,
that
a
young
wench
,
whom
my
poor
dear
mother
loved
so
well
,
should
thus
cast
herself
away
,
and
suffer
herself
to
be
deluded
and
undone
,
after
such
a
noble
stand
as
thou
madst
for
so
long
a
time
?
  
<EOS>
I
think
myself
far
from
being
deluded
and
undone
,
and
am
as
innocent
and
virtuous
as
ever
<EOS>
I
was
in
my
life
.
 
<EOS>
Thou
liest
,
child
,
said
she
.
  
<EOS>
So
your
ladyship
told
me
twice
before
.
  
<EOS>
She
gave
me
a
slap
on
the
hand
for
this
;
and
I
made
a
low
courtesy
,
and
said
,
I
humbly
thank
your
ladyship
!
<EOS>
but
I
could
not
refrain
tears
:
And
added
,
Your
dear
brother
,
madam
,
however
,
wo
n't
thank
your
ladyship
for
this
usage
of
me
,
though
I
do
.
 
<EOS>
Come
a
little
nearer
me
,
my
dear
,
said
she
,
and
thou
shalt
have
a
little
more
than
that
to
tell
him
of
,
if
thou
think'st
thou
hast
not
made
mischief
enough
already
between
a
sister
and
brother
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
child
,
if
he
was
here
,
I
would
serve
thee
worse
,
and
him
too
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
he
was
,
said
I.
 
Dost
thou
threaten
me
,
mischief
-
maker
,
and
insolent
as
thou
art
?
  
<EOS>
Now
,
pray
,
madam
,
said
I
,
(
but
got
to
a
little
distance
,
)
be
pleased
to
reflect
upon
all
that
you
have
said
to
me
,
since
I
have
had
the
honour
,
or
rather
misfortune
,
to
come
into
your
presence
;
whether
you
have
said
one
thing
befitting
your
ladyship
's
degree
to
me
,
even
supposing
I
was
the
wench
and
the
creature
you
imagine
me
to
be
?
 
<EOS>
Come
hither
,
my
pert
dear
,
replied
she
,
come
but
within
my
reach
for
one
moment
,
and
I
'll
answer
thee
as
thou
deservest
.
  
<EOS>
To
be
sure
she
meant
to
box
my
ears
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
should
not
be
worthy
<EOS>
my
happy
lot
if
I
could
not
shew
some
spirit
.
  
<EOS>
When
the
cloth
was
taken
away
,
I
said
,
I
suppose
I
may
now
depart
your
presence
,
madam
?
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
not
,
said
she
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
I
'll
lay
thee
a
wager
,
child
,
thy
stomach
's
too
full
to
eat
,
and
<EOS>
so
thou
may'st
<EOS>
fast
till
thy
<EOS>
mannerly
master
comes
home
.
  
<EOS>
Pray
your
ladyship
,
said
her
woman
,
let
the
poor
girl
sit
down
at
table
with
Mrs.
Jewkes
and
me
.
 
<EOS>
Said
I
<EOS>
,
You
are
very
kind
,
Mrs.
Worden
;
but
<EOS>
times
,
as
you
said
,
are
much
altered
with
me
;
and
I
have
been
of
late
so
much
honoured
with
better
company
,
that
I
ca
n't
stoop
to
yours
.
  
<EOS>
Was
ever
such
confidence
!
<EOS>
said
my
lady
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
Beck
!
<EOS>
poor
Beck
!
<EOS>
said
her
kinsman
;
why
she
beats
you
quite
out
of
the
pit
!
 
<EOS>
Will
your
ladyship
,
said
I
,
be
so
good
as
to
tell
me
how
long
I
am
to
tarry
?
 
<EOS>
For
you
'll
please
to
see
by
that
letter
,
that
I
am
obliged
to
attend
my
master
's
commands
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
I
gave
her
the
dear
gentleman
's
letter
from
Mr.
Carlton
's
,
which
I
thought
would
make
her
use
me
better
,
as
she
might
judge
by
it
of
the
honour
done
me
by
him
.
 
<EOS>
Ay
,
said
she
,
this
is
my
worthy
brother
's
hand
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
directed
to
Mrs.
Andrews
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
to
you
,
I
suppose
,
child
?
 
<EOS>
And
so
she
ran
on
,
making
remarks
as
she
went
along
,
in
this
manner
:
  
<EOS>
My
dearest
PAMELA
,
 
"
<EOS>
Mighty
well
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
hope
my
not
coming
home
this
night
,
will
not
frighten
you
!
 
<EOS>
"
Vastly
tender
,
indeed
!
 
<EOS>
And
did
it
frighten
you
,
child
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
You
may
believe
I
ca
n't
help
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
to
be
sure
!
 
<EOS>
A
person
in
thy
way
of
life
,
is
more
tenderly
used
than
an
honest
wife
.
 
<EOS>
But
mark
the
end
of
it
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
could
have
wished
"
Pr'ythee
,
Jackey
,
mind
this
,
"
 
<EOS>
we
 
"
mind
the
significant
we
,
"
 
had
not
engaged
to
the
good
neighbourhood
,
at
Sir
Simon
's
,
for
to
-
morrow
night
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
does
the
good
neighbourhood
,
and
does
Sir
Simon
,
permit
thy
visits
,
child
?
 
<EOS>
They
shall
have
none
of
mine
,
then
,
I
'll
assure
them
!
"
 
<EOS>
But
I
am
so
desirous
to
set
out
on
Wednesday
for
the
other
house
"
<EOS>
So
,
Jackey
,
but
we
just
nicked
it
<EOS>
,
I
find
:
"
 
that
,
as
well
as
in
return
for
the
civilities
of
so
many
good
friends
,
who
will
be
there
on
purpose
,
I
would
not
put
it
off
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
mind
,
Jackey
.
"
 
<EOS>
What
I
beg
of
you
<EOS>
"
Mind
the
wretch
,
that
could
use
me
and
your
uncle
as
he
has
done
;
he
is
turned
beggar
to
this
creature
!
"
 
<EOS>
I
beg
of
you
,
therefore
,
my
dear
<EOS>
"
My
dear
!
<EOS>
there
's
for
you
!
 
<EOS>
I
wish
I
may
not
be
quite
sick
before
I
get
through
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
What
I
beg
of
you
,
therefore
,
my
dear
,
[
<EOS>
and
then
she
looked
me
full
in
the
face
,
]
<EOS>
is
,
that
you
will
go
in
the
chariot
to
Sir
Simon
's
,
the
sooner
in
the
day
the
better
;
 
"
Dear
heart
!
<EOS>
and
why
so
,
when
WE
were
not
expected
till
night
?
 
<EOS>
Why
,
pray
observe
the
reason
 
Hem
!
"
<EOS>
[
said
she
]
 
<EOS>
B
ecause
<EOS>
you
will
be
diverted
with
the
company
;
 
"
Mighty
kind
,
indeed
!
"
 
<EOS>
who
all
"
Jackey
,
Jackey
,
mind
this
,
"
 
who
all
so
much
admire
you
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
he
'd
ha
'
been
hanged
before
he
would
have
said
so
complaisant
a
thing
,
had
he
been
married
,
I
'm
sure
!
"
 
<EOS>
Very
true
,
aunt
,
said
he
:
<EOS>
A
plain
case
that
!
 
<EOS>
[
Thought
I
,
that
's
hard
upon
poor
matrimony
,
though
I
hope
my
lady
do
n't
find
it
so
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
durst
not
speak
out
.
]
 
<EOS>
W
ho
all
so
much
admire
you
,
[
said
she
,
]
<EOS>
"
I
must
repeat
that
 
Pretty
miss
!
 
<EOS>
I
wish
thou
wast
as
admirable
for
thy
virtue
,
as
for
that
baby
-
face
of
thine
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
I
hope
to
join
you
there
by
your
tea
-
time
in
the
afternoon
!
 
<EOS>
"
So
,
you
're
in
very
good
time
,
child
,
an
hour
or
two
hence
,
to
answer
all
your
important
pre
-
engagements
!
"
 
<EOS>
which
will
be
better
than
going
home
,
and
returning
with
you
;
as
it
will
be
six
miles
difference
to
me
;
and
I
know
the
good
company
will
excuse
my
dress
on
this
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
"
Very
true
;
any
dress
is
good
enough
<EOS>
,
I
'm
sure
,
for
such
company
as
admire
thee
,
child
,
for
a
companion
,
in
thy
ruined
state
!
 
<EOS>
Jackey
,
Jackey
,
mind
,
mind
,
again
!
<EOS>
more
fine
things
still
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
count
every
hour
of
this
little
absence
for
a
day
!
 
<EOS>
"
There
's
for
you
!
 
<EOS>
Let
me
repeat
it
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
 
count
every
hour
of
this
little
absence
for
a
day
!
 
<EOS>
"
Mind
,
too
,
the
wit
of
the
good
man
!
 
<EOS>
One
may
see
love
is
a
new
thing
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
Here
is
a
very
tedious
time
gone
since
he
saw
his
deary
;
no
less
than
,
according
to
his
amorous
calculation
,
a
dozen
days
and
nights
,
at
least
!
<EOS>
and
yet
,
TEDIOUS
as
it
is
,
it
is
but
a
LITTLE
ABSENCE
.
 
<EOS>
Well
said
,
my
good
,
accurate
,
and
consistent
brother
!
  
<EOS>
But
wise
men
in
love
are
always
the
greatest
simpletons
!
 
<EOS>
But
now
cones
the
reason
why
this
LITTLE
ABSENCE
,
which
,
at
the
same
time
,
is
SO
GREAT
an
ABSENCE
,
is
so
tedious
:
"
 
<EOS>
FOR
I
am
"
Ay
,
now
for
it
!
"
 
<EOS>
with
the
UTMOST
sincerity
,
my
dearest
love
"
Out
upon
DEAREST
love
!
 
<EOS>
I
shall
never
love
the
word
again
!
 
<EOS>
Pray
bid
your
uncle
never
call
me
dearest
love
,
Jackey
!
"
 
<EOS>
For
ever
yours
!
 
<EOS>
"
But
,
brother
,
thou
liest
!
 
<EOS>
Thou
knowest
thou
dost
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
,
my
good
Lady
Andrews
,
or
what
shall
I
call
you
?
 
<EOS>
Your
dearest
love
will
be
for
ever
yours
!
 
<EOS>
And
hast
thou
<EOS>
the
vanity
to
believe
this
?
 
<EOS>
But
stay
,
here
is
a
postscript
.
 
<EOS>
The
poor
man
knew
not
when
to
have
done
to
his
dearest
love
.
 
<EOS>
He
's
sadly
in
for't
,
truly
!
 
<EOS>
Why
,
his
dearest
love
,
you
are
mighty
happy
in
such
a
lover
!
"
 
<EOS>
If
you
could
go
to
dine
with
them
<EOS>
"
Cry
you
mercy
,
my
dearest
love
,
now
comes
the
pre-
engagement
!
"
 
<EOS>
it
will
be
a
freedom
that
will
be
very
pleasing
to
them
,
and
the
more
,
as
they
do
n't
expect
it
.
  
<EOS>
Well
,
so
much
for
this
kind
letter
!
 
<EOS>
But
you
see
you
can
not
honour
this
admiring
company
with
this
little
expected
,
and
,
<EOS>
but
in
complaisance
to
his
folly
,
I
dare
say
,
little
desired
freedom
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
can
not
forbear
admiring
you
so
much
myself
,
my
dearest
love
,
that
I
will
not
spare
you
at
all
,
this
whole
evening
:
<EOS>
For
'
tis
a
little
hard
,
if
thy
master
's
sister
may
not
be
blest
a
little
bit
with
thy
charming
company
.
  
<EOS>
So
I
found
I
had
shewn
her
my
letter
to
very
little
purpose
,
and
repented
it
several
times
,
as
she
read
on
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
then
,
said
I
,
<EOS>
I
hope
your
ladyship
will
give
me
leave
to
send
my
excuses
to
your
good
brother
,
and
say
,
that
your
ladyship
is
come
,
and
is
so
fond
of
me
,
that
you
will
not
let
me
leave
you
.
 
<EOS>
Pretty
creature
,
said
she
;
and
wantest
thou
thy
good
master
to
come
,
and
quarrel
with
his
sister
on
thy
account
?
 
<EOS>
But
thou
shalt
not
stir
from
my
presence
;
and
I
would
now
ask
thee
,
What
it
is
thou
meanest
by
shewing
me
this
letter
?
 
<EOS>
Why
,
madam
,
said
I
,
to
shew
your
ladyship
how
I
was
engaged
for
this
day
and
evening
.
 
<EOS>
And
for
nothing
else
?
said
she
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
I
ca
n't
tell
,
madam
,
said
I
:
<EOS>
But
if
you
can
collect
from
it
any
other
circumstances
,
I
might
hope
I
should
not
be
the
worse
treated
.
  
<EOS>
I
saw
her
eyes
began
to
sparkle
with
passion
:
and
she
took
my
hand
,
and
said
,
grasping
it
very
hard
,
I
know
,
confident
creature
,
that
thou
shewedst
it
me
to
insult
me
!
 
<EOS>
You
shewed
it
me
,
to
let
me
see
,
that
he
could
be
civiller
to
a
beggar
born
,
than
to
me
,
or
to
my
good
Lord
Davers
!
 
<EOS>
You
shewed
it
me
,
as
if
you
'd
have
me
to
be
as
credulous
a
fool
as
yourself
,
to
believe
your
marriage
true
,
when
I
know
the
whole
trick
of
it
,
and
have
reason
to
believe
you
do
too
;
and
you
shewed
it
me
,
to
upbraid
me
with
his
stooping
to
such
painted
dirt
,
to
the
disgrace
of
a
family
,
ancient
and
untainted
beyond
most
in
the
kingdom
.
 
<EOS>
And
now
will
I
give
thee
one
hundred
guineas
for
one
bold
word
,
that
I
may
fell
thee
at
my
foot
!
  
<EOS>
Was
not
this
very
dreadful
!
 
<EOS>
To
be
sure
,
I
had
better
have
kept
the
letter
from
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
quite
frightened
!
 
<EOS>
And
this
fearful
menace
,
and
her
fiery
eyes
,
and
rageful
countenance
,
made
me
lose
all
my
courage
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
said
,
weeping
,
Good
your
ladyship
,
pity
me
!
 
<EOS>
Indeed
I
am
honest
<EOS>
;
indeed
I
am
virtuous
;
indeed
I
would
not
do
a
bad
thing
for
the
world
!
  
<EOS>
Though
I
know
,
said
she
,
the
whole
trick
of
thy
pretended
marriage
,
and
thy
foolish
ring
here
,
and
all
the
rest
of
the
wicked
nonsense
,
yet
I
should
not
have
patience
with
thee
,
if
thou
shouldst
but
offer
to
let
me
know
thy
vanity
prompts
thee
to
believe
thou
art
married
to
my
brother
!
  
<EOS>
I
could
not
bear
the
thought
!
 
<EOS>
So
take
care
,
Pamela
<EOS>
;
take
care
,
beggarly
brat
;
take
care
.
  
<EOS>
Good
madam
,
said
I
,
spare
my
dear
parents
.
 
<EOS>
They
are
honest
and
industrious
:
they
were
once
in
a
very
creditable
way
,
and
never
were
beggars
.
 
<EOS>
Misfortunes
may
attend
any
body
:
<EOS>
And
I
can
bear
the
cruellest
imputations
on
myself
,
because
I
know
my
innocence
;
but
upon
such
honest
,
industrious
parents
,
who
went
through
the
greatest
trials
,
without
being
beholden
to
any
thing
but
God
's
blessing
,
and
their
own
hard
labour
;
I
can
not
bear
reflection
.
  
<EOS>
What
!
<EOS>
art
thou
setting
up
for
a
family
,
creature
as
thou
art
!
 
<EOS>
God
give
me
patience
with
thee
!
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
my
brother
's
folly
,
and
his
wickedness
,
together
,
will
,
in
a
little
while
,
occasion
a
search
at
the
heralds
'
office
,
to
set
out
thy
wretched
obscurity
!
 
<EOS>
Provoke
me
,
I
desire
thou
wilt
!
 
<EOS>
One
hundred
guineas
<EOS>
will
I
give
thee
,
to
say
<EOS>
but
thou
thinkest
thou
art
<EOS>
married
to
my
brother
.
  
<EOS>
Your
ladyship
,
I
hope
,
wo
n't
kill
me
:
<EOS>
And
since
nothing
I
can
say
will
please
you
,
but
your
ladyship
is
resolved
to
quarrel
with
me
;
since
I
must
not
say
what
I
think
,
on
one
hand
nor
another
;
whatever
your
ladyship
designs
by
me
,
be
pleased
to
do
,
and
let
me
depart
your
presence
!
  
<EOS>
She
gave
me
a
slap
on
the
hand
,
and
reached
to
box
my
ear
;
but
Mrs.
Jewkes
hearkening
without
,
and
her
woman
too
,
they
both
came
in
at
that
instant
;
and
Mrs.
Jewkes
said
,
pushing
herself
in
between
us
;
Your
ladyship
knows
not
what
you
do
!
 
<EOS>
Indeed
you
do
n't
!
 
<EOS>
My
master
would
never
forgive
me
,
if
I
suffered
,
in
his
house
,
one
he
so
dearly
loves
,
to
be
so
used
;
and
it
must
not
be
,
though
you
are
Lady
Davers
.
 
<EOS>
Her
woman
too
interposed
,
and
told
her
,
I
was
not
worth
her
ladyship
's
anger
.
 
<EOS>
But
she
was
like
a
person
beside
herself
.
  
<EOS>
I
offered
to
go
out
,
and
Mrs.
Jewkes
took
my
hand
to
lead
me
out
:
But
her
kinsman
set
his
back
against
the
door
,
and
put
his
hand
to
his
sword
,
and
said
,
I
should
not
go
,
till
his
aunt
permitted
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
drew
it
half
-
way
,
and
I
was
so
terrified
,
that
I
cried
out
,
<EOS>
Oh
,
the
sword
!
<EOS>
the
sword
!
<EOS>
and
,
not
knowing
what
I
did
,
I
ran
to
my
lady
herself
,
and
clasped
my
arms
about
her
,
forgetting
,
<EOS>
just
then
,
how
much
she
was
my
enemy
,
and
said
,
sinking
on
my
knees
,
Defend
me
,
good
your
ladyship
!
<EOS>
the
sword
!
<EOS>
the
sword
!
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
said
,
Oh
!
<EOS>
my
lady
will
fall
into
fits
!
 
<EOS>
But
Lady
Davers
was
herself
so
startled
at
the
matter
being
carried
so
far
,
that
she
did
not
mind
her
words
,
and
said
,
Jackey
,
do
n't
draw
your
sword
!
 
<EOS>
You
see
,
as
great
as
her
spirit
is
,
she
ca
n't
bear
that
.
  
<EOS>
Come
,
said
she
,
be
comforted
;
he
sha
n't
frighten
you
!
 
<EOS>
I
'll
try
to
overcome
my
anger
,
and
will
pity
you
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
wench
,
rise
up
,
and
do
n't
be
foolish
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
held
her
salts
to
my
nose
,
and
I
did
not
faint
.
<EOS>
And
my
lady
said
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
if
you
would
be
forgiven
,
leave
Pamela
and
me
by
ourselves
;
and
,
Jackey
,
do
you
withdraw
;
only
you
,
Beck
,
stay
.
  
<EOS>
So
I
sat
down
in
the
window
,
all
in
a
sad
fluster
;
for
,
to
be
sure
,
I
was
sadly
frightened
.
 
<EOS>
Said
her
woman
,
You
should
not
sit
in
my
lady
's
presence
,
Mrs.
Pamela
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
let
her
sit
till
she
is
a
little
recovered
of
her
fright
,
said
my
lady
,
and
do
you
set
my
chair
by
her
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
she
sat
over
-
against
me
,
and
said
,
To
be
sure
,
Pamela
,
you
have
been
very
provoking
with
your
tongue
,
to
be
sure
you
have
,
as
well
upon
my
nephew
,
(
who
is
a
man
of
quality
too
,
)
as
me
.
 
<EOS>
And
palliating
her
cruel
usage
,
and
beginning
,
I
suppose
,
to
think
herself
she
had
carried
it
further
than
she
could
answer
it
to
her
brother
,
she
wanted
to
lay
the
fault
upon
me
.
 
<EOS>
Own
,
said
she
,
you
have
been
very
saucy
;
and
beg
my
pardon
,
and
beg
Jackey
's
pardon
,
and
I
will
try
to
pity
you
.
 
<EOS>
For
you
are
a
sweet
girl
,
after
all
;
if
you
had
but
held
out
,
and
been
honest
.
  
<EOS>
@@@Tis
injurious
to
me
,
madam
,
said
I
,
to
imagine
I
am
not
honest
!
 
<EOS>
Said
she
<EOS>
,
Have
you
not
been
a
-
bed
with
my
brother
?
<EOS>
tell
me
that
.
 
<EOS>
Your
ladyship
,
replied
I
,
asks
your
questions
in
a
strange
way
,
and
in
strange
words
.
  
<EOS>
O
!
<EOS>
your
delicacy
is
wounded
,
I
suppose
,
by
my
plain
questions
!
 
<EOS>
This
niceness
will
soon
leave
you
,
wench
:
<EOS>
It
will
,
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
But
answer
me
directly
.
 
<EOS>
Then
your
ladyship
's
next
question
,
said
I
,
will
be
,
<EOS>
Am
I
married
?
 
<EOS>
And
you
wo
n't
bear
my
answer
to
that
 
and
will
beat
me
again
.
  
<EOS>
I
han't
beat
you
yet
;
have
I
,
Beck
?
<EOS>
said
she
.
 
<EOS>
So
you
want
to
make
out
a
story
,
do
you
?
 
<EOS>
But
,
indeed
,
I
ca
n't
bear
thou
shouldst
so
much
as
think
thou
art
my
sister
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
the
whole
trick
of
it
;
and
<EOS>
so
,
'
tis
my
opinion
,
dost
thou
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
only
thy
little
cunning
,
that
it
might
look
like
a
cloak
to
thy
yielding
,
and
get
better
terms
from
him
.
 
<EOS>
Pr'ythee
,
pr'ythee
,
wench
,
thou
seest
<EOS>
I
know
the
world
a
little
;
 
almost
as
much
at
thirty
-
two
,
as
thou
dost
at
sixteen
.
 
<EOS>
Remember
that
!
  
<EOS>
I
rose
from
the
window
,
and
walking
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
,
Beat
me
again
,
if
you
please
,
said
I
,
but
I
must
tell
your
ladyship
<EOS>
,
I
scorn
your
words
,
and
am
as
much
married
as
your
ladyship
!
  
<EOS>
At
that
she
ran
to
me
;
but
her
woman
interposed
again
:
Let
the
vain
wicked
creature
go
from
your
presence
,
madam
,
said
she
.
 
<EOS>
She
is
not
worthy
to
be
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
She
will
<EOS>
but
vex
your
ladyship
.
 
<EOS>
Stand
away
,
Beck
,
said
she
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
an
assertion
that
I
would
not
take
from
my
brother
<EOS>
,
I
ca
n't
bear
it
.
 
<EOS>
As
much
married
as
I
!
 
<EOS>
Is
that
to
be
borne
?
 
<EOS>
But
if
the
creature
believes
she
is
,
madam
,
said
her
woman
,
she
is
to
be
as
much
pitied
for
her
credulity
,
as
despised
for
her
vanity
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
in
hopes
to
have
slipt
out
at
the
door
;
but
she
caught
hold
of
my
gown
,
and
pulled
me
back
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
your
ladyship
,
said
I
,
do
n't
kill
me
!
 
<EOS>
I
have
done
no
harm
.
 
<EOS>
But
she
locked
the
door
,
and
put
the
key
in
her
pocket
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
seeing
Mrs.
Jewkes
before
the
window
,
I
lifted
up
the
sash
,
and
said
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
I
believe
it
would
be
best
for
the
chariot
to
go
to
your
master
,
and
let
him
know
,
that
Lady
Davers
is
here
;
and
I
can
not
leave
her
ladyship
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
resolved
to
be
displeased
,
let
me
say
what
I
would
.
  
<EOS>
Said
she
,
No
,
<EOS>
no
<EOS>
;
he
'll
then
think
,
that
I
make
the
creature
my
companion
,
and
know
not
how
to
part
with
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
thought
your
ladyship
,
replied
I
,
could
not
have
taken
exceptions
at
this
message
.
 
<EOS>
Thou
knowest
nothing
,
wench
,
said
she
,
of
what
belongs
to
people
of
condition
<EOS>
:
How
shouldst
thou
?
 
<EOS>
Nor
,
thought
<EOS>
I
,
do
I
desire
it
,
at
this
rate
.
  
<EOS>
What
shall
I
say
,
madam
?
<EOS>
said
I.
 
Nothing
at
all
,
replied
she
;
let
him
expect
his
dearest
love
,
and
be
disappointed
;
it
is
<EOS>
but
adding
a
few
more
hours
,
and
he
will
make
every
one
a
day
,
in
his
amorous
account
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
coming
nearer
me
,
and
my
lady
walking
about
the
room
,
being
then
at
the
end
<EOS>
,
I
whispered
,
Let
Robert
stay
at
the
elms
;
I
'll
have
a
struggle
for't
by
and
by
.
  
<EOS>
As
much
married
as
I
!
<EOS>
repeated
she
.
 
<EOS>
The
insolence
of
the
creature
!
 
<EOS>
And
so
she
walked
about
the
room
,
talking
to
herself
,
to
her
woman
,
and
now
and
then
to
me
;
but
seeing
I
could
not
please
her
<EOS>
,
I
thought
I
had
better
be
silent
.
 
<EOS>
And
then
it
was
,
<EOS>
Am
I
not
worthy
an
answer
?
 
<EOS>
If
I
speak
,
said
I
,
your
ladyship
is
angry
at
me
,
though
ever
so
respectfully
;
if
I
do
not
,
I
can
not
please
:
Would
your
ladyship
tell
me
<EOS>
but
how
I
shall
oblige
you
,
and
I
would
do
it
with
all
my
heart
.
  
<EOS>
Confess
the
truth
,
said
she
,
that
thou
art
an
undone
creature
;
<EOS>
hast
been
in
bed
with
thy
master
;
and
art
sorry
for
it
,
and
for
the
mischief
thou
hast
occasioned
between
him
and
me
;
and
then
I
'll
pity
thee
,
and
persuade
him
to
pack
thee
off
,
with
a
hundred
or
two
of
guineas
;
and
some
honest
farmer
may
take
pity
of
thee
,
and
patch
up
thy
shame
,
for
the
sake
of
the
money
;
and
if
nobody
will
have
thee
,
thou
must
vow
penitence
,
and
be
as
humble
as
I
once
thought
thee
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
quite
sick
at
heart
,
at
all
this
passionate
extravagance
,
and
to
be
hindered
from
being
<EOS>
where
was
the
desire
of
my
soul
,
and
afraid
too
of
incurring
my
dear
master
's
displeasure
;
and
,
as
I
sat
,
I
saw
it
was
no
hard
matter
to
get
out
of
the
window
into
the
front
yard
<EOS>
,
the
parlour
being
even
with
the
yard
,
and
so
have
a
fair
run
for
it
;
and
after
I
had
seen
my
lady
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
again
,
in
her
walks
,
having
not
pulled
down
the
sash
,
when
I
spoke
to
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
I
got
upon
the
seat
,
and
whipped
out
in
a
minute
,
and
ran
away
as
hard
as
I
could
drive
,
my
lady
calling
after
me
to
return
,
and
her
woman
at
the
other
window
:
But
two
of
her
servants
appearing
at
her
crying
out
,
and
she
bidding
them
to
stop
me
,
I
said
,
Touch
me
at
your
peril
,
fellows
!
 
<EOS>
But
their
lady
's
commands
would
have
prevailed
on
them
,
had
not
Mr.
Colbrand
,
who
,
it
seems
,
had
been
kindly
ordered
,
by
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
to
be
within
call
,
when
she
saw
how
I
was
treated
,
come
up
,
and
put
on
one
of
his
deadly
fierce
looks
,
the
only
time
,
I
thought
,
it
ever
became
him
,
and
said
,
He
would
chine
the
man
,
that
was
his
word
,
who
offered
to
touch
his
lady
;
and
so
he
ran
alongside
of
me
;
and
I
heard
my
lady
say
,
The
creature
flies
like
a
bird
!
 
<EOS>
And
,
indeed
,
Mr.
Colbrand
,
with
his
huge
strides
,
could
hardly
keep
pace
with
me
;
and
I
never
stopped
,
till
I
got
to
the
chariot
;
and
Robert
had
got
down
,
seeing
me
running
at
a
distance
,
and
held
the
door
in
his
hand
,
with
the
step
ready
down
;
and
in
I
jumped
,
without
touching
the
step
,
saying
,
Drive
me
,
drive
me
,
as
fast
as
you
can
,
out
of
my
lady
's
reach
!
 
<EOS>
And
he
mounted
;
and
<EOS>
Colbrand
said
,
Do
n't
be
frightened
,
madam
<EOS>
;
nobody
shall
hurt
you
.
 
<EOS>
And
shut
the
door
,
and
away
Robert
drove
;
but
I
was
quite
out
of
breath
,
and
did
not
recover
it
,
and
my
fright
,
all
the
way
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Colbrand
was
so
kind
,
but
I
did
not
know
it
till
the
chariot
stopped
at
Sir
Simon
's
,
to
step
up
behind
the
carriage
,
lest
,
as
he
said
,
my
lady
should
send
after
me
;
and
he
told
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
when
he
got
home
,
that
he
never
saw
such
a
runner
as
me
in
his
life
.
  
<EOS>
When
the
chariot
stopped
,
which
was
not
till
six
o'clock
,
so
long
did
this
cruel
lady
keep
me
,
Miss
Darnford
ran
out
to
me
:
<EOS>
O
madam
,
said
she
,
ten
times
welcome
!
<EOS>
but
you
'll
be
beat
,
I
can
tell
you
!
<EOS>
for
here
has
been
Mr.
B
#
#
#
#
<EOS>
come
these
two
hours
,
and
is
very
angry
with
you
.
  
<EOS>
That
's
hard
indeed
,
said
I
;
 
<EOS>
Indeed
I
ca
n't
afford
it
;
 
for
I
hardly
knew
what
I
said
,
having
not
recovered
my
fright
.
 
<EOS>
Let
me
sit
down
,
miss
,
any
where
,
said
I
;
for
I
have
been
sadly
off
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
sat
down
,
and
was
quite
sick
with
the
hurry
of
my
spirits
,
and
leaned
upon
her
arm
.
  
<EOS>
Said
she
,
Your
lord
and
master
came
in
very
moody
;
and
when
he
had
staid
an
hour
,
and
you
not
come
,
he
began
to
fret
,
and
said
,
He
did
not
expect
so
little
complaisance
from
you
.
 
<EOS>
And
he
is
now
sat
down
,
with
great
persuasion
,
to
a
game
at
loo
.
 
<EOS>
Come
,
you
must
make
your
appearance
,
lady
fair
;
for
he
is
too
sullen
to
attend
you
,
I
doubt
.
  
<EOS>
You
have
no
strangers
,
have
you
miss
?
<EOS>
said
I.
 
Only
two
women
relations
from
Stamford
,
<EOS>
replied
she
,
and
an
humble
servant
of
one
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
Only
all
the
world
,
miss
!
said
I.
 
What
shall
I
do
,
if
he
be
angry
?
 
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
bear
that
.
  
<EOS>
Just
as
I
had
said
so
,
came
in
Lady
Darnford
and
Lady
Jones
to
chide
me
,
as
they
said
,
for
not
coming
sooner
.
 
<EOS>
And
before
I
could
speak
,
came
in
my
dear
master
.
 
<EOS>
I
ran
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
How
dy'e
Pamela
?
<EOS>
said
he
;
and
saluting
me
,
with
a
little
more
formality
than
I
could
well
bear
.
 
<EOS>
I
expected
half
a
word
from
me
,
<EOS>
when
I
was
so
complaisant
to
your
choice
,
would
have
determined
you
,
and
that
you
'd
have
been
here
to
dinner
;
 
and
the
rather
,
as
I
made
my
request
a
reasonable
one
,
and
what
I
thought
would
be
agreeable
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
O
dear
sir
,
said
I
,
pray
,
pray
,
hear
me
,
and
you
'll
pity
me
,
and
not
be
displeased
!
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
will
tell
you
,
that
as
soon
as
I
had
your
kind
commands
,
I
said
,
I
would
obey
you
,
and
come
to
dinner
with
these
good
ladies
;
and
so
prepared
myself
instantly
,
with
all
the
pleasure
in
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
Lady
Darnford
and
miss
said
I
was
their
dear
!
  
<EOS>
Look
you
,
said
miss
,
did
I
not
tell
you
,
stately
one
,
that
something
must
have
happened
?
 
<EOS>
But
,
O
these
tyrants
!
<EOS>
these
men
!
  
<EOS>
Why
,
what
hindered
it
,
my
dear
?
<EOS>
said
he
:
give
yourself
time
<EOS>
;
you
seem
out
of
breath
!
 
<EOS>
O
sir
,
said
I
,
out
of
breath
!
<EOS>
well
I
may
!
 
<EOS>
For
,
just
as
I
was
ready
to
come
away
,
who
should
drive
into
the
court
-
yard
,
but
Lady
Davers
!
 
<EOS>
Lady
Davers
!
 
<EOS>
Nay
,
then
,
my
sweet
dear
,
said
he
,
and
saluted
me
more
tenderly
,
hast
thou
had
a
worse
trial
than
I
wish
thee
,
from
one
of
the
haughtiest
women
in
England
,
though
my
sister
!
 
<EOS>
For
,
she
too
,
my
Pamela
,
was
spoiled
by
my
good
mother
!
 
<EOS>
But
have
you
seen
her
?
  
<EOS>
Yes
,
sir
,
said
I
,
and
more
than
seen
her
!
 
<EOS>
Why
sure
,
said
he
,
she
has
not
had
the
insolence
to
strike
my
girl
!
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
said
I
,
but
tell
me
you
forgive
me
;
for
indeed
I
could
not
come
sooner
;
and
these
good
ladies
but
excuse
me
;
and
I
'll
tell
you
all
another
time
;
for
to
take
up
the
good
company
's
attention
now
,
will
spoil
their
pleasantry
,
and
be
to
them
,
though
more
important
to
me
,
like
the
broken
china
you
cautioned
me
about
.
  
<EOS>
That
's
a
dear
girl
!
<EOS>
said
he
;
<EOS>
I
see
my
hints
are
not
thrown
away
upon
you
;
and
I
beg
pardon
for
being
angry
with
you
;
and
,
for
the
future
,
will
stay
till
I
hear
your
defence
,
before
I
judge
you
.
 
<EOS>
Said
Miss
Darnford
,
This
is
a
little
better
!
 
<EOS>
To
own
a
fault
is
some
reparation
;
and
what
every
lordly
husband
will
not
do
.
 
<EOS>
He
said
,
But
tell
me
,
my
dear
,
did
Lady
Davers
offer
you
any
incivility
?
 
<EOS>
O
sir
,
replied
I
,
she
is
your
sister
,
and
I
must
not
tell
you
all
;
but
she
has
used
me
very
severely
!
 
<EOS>
Did
you
tell
her
,
said
he
,
you
were
married
?
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
sir
,
I
did
at
last
;
but
she
will
have
it
'
tis
a
sham
-
marriage
,
and
that
I
am
a
vile
creature
:
and
she
was
ready
to
beat
me
,
when
I
said
so
:
for
she
could
not
have
patience
,
that
I
should
be
deemed
her
sister
,
as
she
said
.
  
<EOS>
How
unlucky
it
was
,
replied
he
,
<EOS>
I
was
not
at
home
?
 
<EOS>
Why
did
you
not
send
to
me
here
?
 
<EOS>
Send
,
sir
!
<EOS>
I
was
kept
prisoner
by
force
.
 
<EOS>
They
would
not
let
me
stir
,
or
do
you
think
I
would
have
been
hindered
from
obeying
you
?
<EOS>
Nay
,
I
told
them
,
that
I
had
a
pre
-
engagement
;
but
she
ridiculed
me
,
and
said
,
Waiting
-
maids
talk
of
pre
-
engagements
!
 
<EOS>
And
then
I
shewed
her
your
kind
letter
;
and
she
made
a
thousand
remarks
upon
it
,
and
made
me
wish
I
had
not
.
 
<EOS>
In
short
,
whatever
I
could
do
or
say
,
there
was
no
pleasing
her
;
and
I
was
a
creature
and
wench
,
and
all
that
was
naught
.
 
<EOS>
But
you
must
not
be
angry
with
her
on
my
account
.
  
<EOS>
Well
,
but
,
said
he
,
I
suppose
she
hardly
asked
you
to
dine
with
her
;
for
she
came
before
dinner
,
I
presume
,
if
it
was
soon
after
you
had
received
my
letter
!
 
<EOS>
No
,
sir
,
dine
with
my
lady
!
<EOS>
no
,
indeed
!
 
<EOS>
Why
,
she
would
make
me
wait
at
table
upon
her
,
with
her
woman
,
because
she
would
not
expose
herself
and
me
before
the
men
-
servants
;
which
you
know
,
sir
,
was
very
good
of
her
ladyship
.
  
<EOS>
Well
,
said
he
,
but
did
you
wait
upon
her
?
 
<EOS>
Would
you
have
had
me
,
sir
?
<EOS>
said
I.
 
Only
,
Pamela
,
replied
he
,
if
you
did
,
and
knew
not
what
belonged
to
your
character
,
as
my
wife
,
I
shall
be
very
angry
with
you
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
said
I
,
I
did
not
,
but
refused
it
,
out
of
consideration
to
the
dignity
you
have
raised
me
to
;
else
,
sir
,
I
could
have
waited
on
my
knees
upon
your
sister
.
  
<EOS>
Now
,
said
he
,
you
confirm
my
opinion
of
your
prudence
and
judgment
.
 
<EOS>
She
is
an
insolent
woman
,
and
shall
dearly
repent
it
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
sir
,
she
is
to
be
excused
,
because
she
wo
n't
believe
I
am
indeed
married
;
so
do
n't
be
too
angry
at
her
ladyship
.
  
<EOS>
He
said
,
Ladies
,
pray
do
n't
let
us
keep
you
from
the
company
;
I
'll
only
ask
a
question
or
two
more
,
and
attend
you
.
 
<EOS>
Said
Lady
Jones
,
<EOS>
I
so
much
long
to
hear
this
story
of
poor
madam
's
persecution
,
that
,
if
it
was
not
improper
,
I
should
be
glad
to
stay
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Darnford
would
stay
for
the
same
reason
;
my
master
saying
,
He
had
no
secrets
to
ask
;
and
that
it
was
kind
of
them
to
interest
themselves
in
my
grievances
.
  
<EOS>
But
Lady
Darnford
went
into
the
company
,
and
told
them
the
cause
of
my
detention
;
for
,
it
seems
,
my
dear
master
loved
me
too
well
,
to
keep
to
himself
the
disappointment
my
not
being
here
to
receive
him
,
was
to
him
;
and
they
had
all
given
the
two
Misses
Boroughs
and
Mr.
Perry
,
the
Stamford
guests
,
such
a
character
of
me
,
that
they
said
they
were
impatient
to
see
me
.
  
<EOS>
Said
my
master
,
But
,
Pamela
,
you
said
they
and
them
:
<EOS>
Who
had
my
sister
with
her
besides
her
woman
?
 
<EOS>
Her
nephew
,
sir
,
and
three
footmen
on
horseback
;
and
she
and
her
woman
were
in
her
chariot
and
six
.
  
<EOS>
That
's
a
sad
coxcomb
,
said
he
:
How
did
he
behave
to
you
?
 
<EOS>
Not
extraordinarily
,
sir
;
but
I
should
not
complain
;
for
I
was
even
with
him
;
because
I
thought
I
ought
not
to
bear
with
him
as
with
my
lady
.
  
<EOS>
By
Heaven
!
<EOS>
said
he
,
if
I
knew
he
behaved
unhandsomely
to
my
jewel
,
I
'd
send
him
home
to
his
uncle
without
his
ears
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
sir
,
returned
I
,
I
was
as
hard
upon
him
as
he
was
upon
me
.
 
<EOS>
Said
he
,
'
Tis
kind
to
say
so
;
but
I
believe
I
shall
make
them
dearly
repent
their
visit
,
if
I
find
their
behaviour
to
call
for
my
resentment
.
  
<EOS>
But
,
sure
,
my
dear
,
you
might
have
got
away
when
you
went
to
your
own
dinner
?
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
sir
,
said
I
,
her
ladyship
locked
me
in
,
and
would
not
let
me
stir
.
 
<EOS>
So
you
ha'nt
ate
any
dinner
?
 
<EOS>
No
,
indeed
,
sir
,
nor
had
a
stomach
for
any
.
 
<EOS>
My
poor
dear
,
said
he
.
 
<EOS>
But
then
,
how
got
you
away
at
last
?
 
<EOS>
O
sir
,
replied
I
,
I
jumped
out
of
the
parlour
window
,
and
ran
away
to
the
chariot
,
which
had
waited
for
me
several
hours
,
by
the
elm
-
walk
,
from
the
time
of
my
lady
's
coming
(
for
I
was
just
going
,
as
I
said
)
;
and
Mr.
Colbrand
conducted
me
through
her
servants
,
whom
she
called
to
,
to
stop
me
;
and
was
so
kind
to
step
behind
the
chariot
,
unknown
to
me
,
and
saw
me
safe
here
.
  
<EOS>
I
'm
sure
,
said
he
,
these
insolent
creatures
must
have
treated
you
vilely
.
<EOS>
But
tell
me
,
what
part
did
Mrs.
Jewkes
act
in
this
affair
?
 
<EOS>
A
very
kind
part
,
sir
,
said
I
,
in
my
behalf
;
and
I
shall
thank
her
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
Sweet
creature
!
<EOS>
said
he
,
thou
lovest
to
speak
well
of
every
body
;
but
I
hope
she
deserves
it
;
for
she
knew
you
were
married
.
 
<EOS>
But
come
,
we
'll
now
join
the
company
,
and
try
to
forget
all
you
have
suffered
,
for
two
or
three
hours
,
that
we
may
not
tire
the
company
with
our
concerns
and
resume
the
subject
as
we
go
home
:
and
you
shall
find
I
will
do
you
justice
,
as
I
ought
.
 
<EOS>
But
you
forgive
me
,
sir
,
said
I
,
and
are
not
angry
?
 
<EOS>
Forgive
you
,
my
dear
!
<EOS>
returned
he
 
<EOS>
I
hope
you
forgive
me
!
 
<EOS>
I
shall
never
make
you
satisfaction
for
what
you
have
suffered
from
me
,
and
for
me
!
 
<EOS>
And
with
those
words
he
led
me
into
the
company
.
  
<EOS>
He
very
kindly
presented
me
to
the
two
stranger
ladies
,
and
the
gentleman
,
and
them
to
me
:
and
Sir
Simon
,
who
was
at
cards
,
rose
from
table
,
and
saluted
me
:
<EOS>
Adad
!
<EOS>
madam
,
said
he
,
I
'm
glad
to
see
you
here
.
<EOS>
What
,
it
seems
you
have
been
a
prisoner
!
 
<EOS>
'
Twas
<EOS>
well
you
was
,
or
your
spouse
and
<EOS>
I
should
have
sat
in
judgment
upon
you
,
and
condemned
you
to
a
fearful
punishment
for
your
first
crime
of
laesae
majestatis
:
(
I
had
this
explained
to
me
afterwards
,
as
a
sort
of
treason
against
my
liege
lord
and
husband
:
)
<EOS>
for
we
husbands
hereabouts
,
said
he
,
are
resolved
to
turn
over
a
new
leaf
with
our
wives
,
and
your
lord
and
master
shall
shew
us
the
way
,
I
can
tell
you
that
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
see
by
your
eyes
,
<EOS>
my
sweet
culprit
,
added
he
,
and
your
complexion
<EOS>
,
you
have
had
sour
sauce
to
your
sweet
meat
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Darnford
said
,
I
think
we
are
obliged
to
our
sweet
guest
,
at
last
;
for
she
was
forced
to
jump
out
at
a
window
to
come
to
us
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
!
<EOS>
said
Mrs.
Peters
;
 
and
my
master
's
back
being
turned
,
says
she
,
Lady
Davers
,
when
a
maiden
,
was
always
vastly
passionate
;
but
a
very
good
lady
when
her
passion
was
over
.
 
<EOS>
And
she
'd
make
nothing
of
slapping
her
maids
about
,
and
begging
their
pardons
afterwards
,
if
they
took
it
patiently
;
otherwise
she
used
to
say
the
creatures
were
even
with
her
.
  
<EOS>
Ay
,
said
I
,
I
have
been
a
many
creatures
and
wenches
,
and
I
know
not
what
;
for
these
were
the
names
she
gave
me
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
thought
I
ought
to
act
up
to
the
part
her
dear
brother
has
given
me
;
and
so
I
have
but
just
escaped
a
good
cuffing
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Boroughs
said
to
her
sister
,
as
I
overheard
,
but
she
did
not
design
I
should
,
What
a
sweet
creature
is
this
!
<EOS>
and
then
she
takes
so
little
upon
her
,
is
so
free
,
so
easy
,
and
owns
the
honour
done
her
,
so
obligingly
!
<EOS>
said
Mr.
Perry
,
softly
,
<EOS>
The
loveliest
person
I
ever
saw
!
 
<EOS>
Who
could
have
the
heart
to
be
angry
with
her
one
moment
?
  
<EOS>
Says
Miss
Darnford
,
<EOS>
Here
,
my
dearest
neighbour
,
these
gentry
are
admiring
you
strangely
;
and
Mr.
Perry
says
,
you
are
the
loveliest
lady
he
ever
saw
;
and
he
says
it
to
his
own
mistress
's
face
too
,
I
'll
assure
you
!
 
<EOS>
Or
else
,
says
Miss
Boroughs
,
I
should
think
he
much
flattered
me
.
  
<EOS>
O
,
madam
,
you
are
exceedingly
obliging
!
<EOS>
but
your
kind
opinion
ought
to
teach
me
humility
,
and
to
reverence
so
generous
a
worth
as
can
give
a
preference
against
yourself
,
where
it
is
so
little
due
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
madam
,
said
Miss
Nanny
Boroughs
<EOS>
,
I
love
my
sister
well
;
but
it
would
be
a
high
compliment
to
any
lady
,
to
be
deemed
worthy
a
second
or
third
place
after
you
.
  
<EOS>
There
is
no
answering
such
politeness
,
said
I
:
<EOS>
I
am
sure
Lady
Davers
was
very
cruel
to
keep
me
from
such
company
.
 
<EOS>
'
Twas
our
loss
,
madam
,
says
Miss
Darnford
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
allow
it
,
said
I
,
in
degree
;
for
you
have
all
been
deprived
,
several
hours
,
of
an
humble
admirer
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Perry
said
,
I
never
before
saw
so
young
a
lady
shine
forth
with
such
graces
of
mind
and
person
.
 
<EOS>
Alas
!
<EOS>
sir
,
said
I
,
my
master
coming
up
,
mine
is
but
a
borrowed
shine
,
like
that
of
the
moon
.
 
<EOS>
Here
is
the
sun
,
to
whose
fervent
glow
of
generosity
<EOS>
I
owe
all
the
faint
lustre
,
that
your
goodness
is
pleased
to
look
upon
with
so
much
kind
distinction
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Perry
was
pleased
to
hold
up
his
hands
;
and
the
ladies
looked
upon
one
another
.
 
<EOS>
And
my
master
said
,
<EOS>
hearing
part
of
the
last
sentence
,
What
's
the
pretty
subject
,
that
my
Pamela
is
displaying
so
sweetly
her
talents
upon
?
  
<EOS>
Oh
!
sir
,
said
Mr.
Perry
,
I
will
pronounce
you
the
happiest
man
in
England
:
and
so
said
they
all
.
  
<EOS>
My
master
said
,
most
generously
,
Thank
ye
,
thank
ye
,
thank
ye
,
all
round
,
<EOS>
my
dear
friends
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
not
your
subject
;
but
if
you
believe
me
so
,
for
a
single
instance
of
this
dear
girl
's
goodness
,
what
must
I
think
myself
,
when
blessed
with
a
thousand
instances
,
and
experiencing
it
in
every
single
act
and
word
!
 
<EOS>
I
do
assure
you
my
Pamela
's
person
,
all
lovely
as
you
see
it
,
is
far
short
of
her
mind
:
<EOS>
That
,
indeed
,
first
attracted
my
admiration
,
and
made
me
her
lover
:
but
they
were
the
beauties
of
her
mind
,
that
made
me
her
husband
;
and
proud
,
my
sweet
dear
,
said
he
,
pressing
my
hand
,
am
I
of
that
title
.
  
<EOS>
Well
,
said
Mr.
Perry
,
very
kindly
and
politely
,
excellent
as
your
lady
is
,
I
know
not
the
gentleman
that
could
deserve
her
,
but
that
one
who
could
say
such
just
and
such
fine
things
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
all
abashed
;
and
took
Miss
Darnford
's
hand
,
and
said
,
Save
me
,
dear
miss
,
by
your
sweet
example
,
from
my
rising
pride
.
 
<EOS>
But
could
I
deserve
half
these
kind
things
<EOS>
,
what
a
happy
creature
should
I
be
!
<EOS>
said
Miss
Darnford
,
You
deserve
them
all
,
indeed
you
do
.
  
<EOS>
The
greatest
part
of
the
company
having
sat
down
to
loo
,
my
master
being
pressed
,
said
he
would
take
one
game
at
whist
;
but
had
rather
be
excused
too
,
having
been
up
all
night
:
and
I
asked
how
his
friend
did
?
 
<EOS>
We
'll
talk
of
that
,
said
he
,
another
time
;
which
,
and
his
seriousness
,
made
me
fear
the
poor
gentleman
was
dead
,
as
it
proved
.
  
<EOS>
We
cast
in
,
and
Miss
Boroughs
and
my
master
were
together
,
and
Mr.
Perry
and
I
;
and
I
had
all
four
honours
the
first
time
,
and
we
were
up
at
one
deal
.
 
<EOS>
Said
my
master
,
An
honourable
hand
,
Pamela
,
should
go
with
an
honourable
heart
;
but
you
'd
not
have
been
up
,
if
a
knave
had
not
been
one
.
 
<EOS>
Whist
,
sir
,
said
Mr.
Perry
,
you
know
,
was
a
court
game
originally
;
and
the
knave
<EOS>
,
I
suppose
,
signified
always
the
prime
minister
.
  
<EOS>
@@@Tis
<EOS>
well
,
said
my
master
,
if
now
there
is
but
one
knave
in
a
court
,
out
of
four
persons
,
take
the
court
through
.
  
<EOS>
The
king
and
queen
,
sir
,
said
Mr.
Perry
,
can
do
no
wrong
,
you
know
.
 
<EOS>
So
there
are
two
that
must
be
good
out
of
four
;
and
the
ace
seems
too
plain
a
card
to
mean
much
hurt
.
  
<EOS>
We
compliment
the
king
,
said
my
master
,
in
that
manner
;
and
'
tis
well
to
do
so
,
because
there
is
something
sacred
in
the
character
.
 
<EOS>
But
yet
,
if
force
of
example
be
considered
,
it
is
going
a
great
way
;
for
certainly
a
good
master
makes
a
good
servant
,
generally
speaking
.
  
<EOS>
One
thing
,
added
he
,
I
will
say
,
in
regard
to
the
ace
:
I
have
always
looked
upon
that
plain
and
honest
looking
card
in
the
light
you
do
:
and
have
considered
whist
as
an
English
game
in
its
original
;
which
has
made
me
fonder
of
it
than
of
any
other
.
 
<EOS>
For
by
the
ace
I
have
always
thought
the
laws
of
the
land
denoted
;
and
as
the
ace
is
above
the
king
or
queen
,
and
wins
them
,
I
think
the
law
should
be
thought
so
too
;
though
,
may
be
,
I
shall
be
deemed
a
Whig
for
my
opinion
.
  
<EOS>
I
shall
never
play
whist
,
said
Mr.
Perry
,
without
thinking
of
this
,
and
shall
love
the
game
the
better
for
the
thought
;
though
I
am
no
party
-
man
.
<EOS>
Nor
I
,
said
my
master
;
for
I
think
the
distinctions
of
whig
and
tory
odious
;
and
love
the
one
or
the
other
only
as
they
are
honest
and
worthy
men
;
and
have
never
(
nor
never
shall
,
hope
)
<EOS>
given
a
vote
,
but
according
to
what
I
thought
was
for
the
public
good
,
let
either
whig
or
tory
propose
it
.
  
<EOS>
I
wish
,
sir
,
replied
Mr.
Perry
,
all
gentlemen
in
your
station
would
act
so
.
 
<EOS>
If
there
was
no
undue
influence
,
said
my
master
,
I
am
willing
to
think
so
well
of
all
mankind
,
that
I
believe
they
generally
would
.
  
<EOS>
But
you
see
,
said
he
,
by
my
Pamela
's
hand
,
when
all
the
court
-
cards
get
together
,
and
are
acted
by
one
mind
,
the
game
is
usually
turned
accordingly
:
Though
now
and
then
,
too
,
it
may
be
so
circumstanced
,
that
honours
will
do
them
no
good
,
and
they
are
forced
to
depend
altogether
upon
tricks
.
  
<EOS>
I
thought
this
way
of
talking
prettier
than
the
game
itself
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
said
,
Though
I
have
won
the
game
,
I
hope
I
am
no
trickster
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
said
my
master
,
God
forbid
but
court
-
cards
should
sometimes
win
with
honour
!
 
<EOS>
But
you
see
,
for
all
that
<EOS>
,
your
game
is
as
much
owing
to
the
knave
as
the
king
;
and
you
,
my
fair
-
one
,
lost
no
advantage
,
when
it
was
put
into
your
power
.
  
<EOS>
Else
,
sir
,
said
I
,
I
should
not
have
done
justice
to
my
partner
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
certainly
right
,
Pamela
,
replied
he
;
though
you
thereby
beat
your
husband
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
said
I
,
you
may
be
my
partner
next
,
and
I
must
do
justice
,
you
know
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
said
he
,
always
choose
so
worthy
a
friend
,
as
chance
has
given
you
for
a
partner
,
and
I
shall
never
find
fault
with
you
,
do
what
you
will
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Perry
said
,
You
are
very
good
to
me
,
sir
;
and
Miss
Boroughs
,
I
observed
,
seemed
pleased
with
the
compliment
to
her
humble
servant
;
by
which
I
saw
she
esteemed
him
,
as
he
appears
to
deserve
.
 
<EOS>
Dear
sir
!
<EOS>
said
I
,
how
much
better
is
this
,
than
to
be
locked
in
by
Lady
Davers
!
  
<EOS>
The
supper
was
brought
in
sooner
on
my
account
,
because
I
had
had
no
dinner
;
and
there
passed
very
agreeable
compliments
on
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
Lady
Darnford
would
help
me
first
,
because
I
had
so
long
fasted
,
as
she
said
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
Simon
would
have
placed
himself
next
me
:
<EOS>
And
my
master
said
,
He
thought
it
was
best
,
where
there
was
an
equal
number
of
ladies
and
gentlemen
,
that
they
should
sit
,
intermingled
,
that
the
gentlemen
might
be
employed
in
helping
and
serving
the
ladies
.
 
<EOS>
Lady
Darnford
said
,
She
hoped
Sir
Simon
would
not
sit
above
any
ladies
at
his
own
table
especially
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
said
he
,
I
shall
sit
over
-
against
her
,
however
,
and
that
's
as
well
.
  
<EOS>
My
dearest
sir
could
not
keep
his
eyes
off
me
,
and
seemed
generously
delighted
with
all
I
did
,
and
all
I
said
;
and
every
one
was
pleased
to
see
his
kind
and
affectionate
behaviour
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Jones
brought
up
the
discourse
about
Lady
Davers
again
;
and
my
master
said
,
I
fear
,
Pamela
,
you
have
been
hardly
used
,
more
than
you
'll
say
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
my
sister
's
passionate
temper
too
well
,
to
believe
she
could
be
over
-
civil
to
you
,
especially
as
it
happened
so
unluckily
that
I
was
out
.
 
<EOS>
If
,
added
he
,
she
had
no
pique
to
you
,
my
dear
,
yet
what
has
passed
between
her
and
me
,
has
so
exasperated
her
,
that
I
know
she
would
have
quarrelled
with
my
horse
,
if
she
had
thought
I
valued
it
,
and
nobody
else
was
in
her
way
.
 
<EOS>
Dear
sir
,
said
I
,
do
n't
say
so
of
good
Lady
Davers
.
  
<EOS>
Why
,
my
dear
,
said
he
,
<EOS>
I
know
she
came
on
purpose
to
quarrel
;
and
had
she
not
found
herself
under
a
very
violent
uneasiness
,
after
what
had
passed
between
us
,
and
my
treatment
of
her
lord
's
letter
,
she
would
not
have
offered
to
come
near
me
.
 
<EOS>
What
sort
of
language
had
she
for
me
,
Pamela
?
<EOS>
O
sir
,
very
good
,
only
her
well
-
mannered
brother
,
and
such
as
that
!
  
<EOS>
Only
,
said
he
,
'
tis
taking
up
the
attention
of
the
company
disagreeably
,
or
I
could
tell
you
almost
every
word
she
said
.
 
<EOS>
Lady
Jones
wished
to
hear
a
further
account
of
my
lady
's
conduct
,
and
most
of
the
company
joined
with
her
,
particularly
Mrs.
Peters
;
who
said
,
that
as
they
knew
the
story
,
and
Lady
Davers
's
temper
,
though
she
was
very
good
in
the
main
,
they
could
wish
to
be
so
agreeably
entertained
,
if
he
and
I
pleased
;
because
they
imagined
I
should
have
no
difficulties
after
this
.
  
<EOS>
Tell
me
,
then
,
Pamela
,
said
he
,
did
she
lift
up
her
hand
at
you
?
 
<EOS>
Did
she
strike
you
?
 
<EOS>
But
I
hope
not
!
 
<EOS>
A
little
slap
of
the
hand
,
said
I
,
or
so
.
  
<EOS>
Insolent
woman
!
 
<EOS>
She
did
not
,
I
hope
,
offer
to
strike
your
face
?
 
<EOS>
Why
,
said
I
<EOS>
,
I
was
a
little
saucy
once
or
twice
;
and
she
would
have
given
me
a
cuff
on
the
ear
,
if
her
woman
and
Mrs.
Jewkes
had
not
interposed
.
 
<EOS>
Why
did
you
not
come
out
at
the
door
?
 
<EOS>
Because
,
said
I
,
her
ladyship
sat
in
the
chair
against
it
,
one
while
,
and
another
while
locked
it
;
else
I
offered
several
times
to
get
away
.
  
<EOS>
She
knew
I
expected
you
here
<EOS>
:
You
say
,
you
shewed
her
my
letter
to
you
?
<EOS>
Yes
,
sir
,
said
I
;
but
I
had
better
not
;
for
she
as
then
more
exasperated
,
and
made
strange
comments
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
doubt
it
not
,
said
he
;
but
,
did
she
not
see
,
by
the
kind
epithets
in
it
,
that
there
was
no
room
to
doubt
of
our
being
married
?
 
<EOS>
O
,
sir
,
replied
I
,
and
made
the
company
smile
,
she
said
,
For
that
very
reason
she
was
sure
I
was
not
married
.
  
<EOS>
That
's
like
my
sister
!
<EOS>
said
he
;
exactly
like
her
;
and
yet
she
lives
very
happily
herself
:
for
her
poor
lord
never
contradicts
her
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
he
dares
not
.
  
<EOS>
You
were
a
great
many
wenches
,
were
you
not
,
my
dear
?
<EOS>
for
that
's
a
great
word
with
her
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
sir
,
said
I
,
wenches
and
creatures
out
of
number
;
and
worse
than
all
that
.
 
<EOS>
What
?
<EOS>
tell
me
,
my
dear
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
said
I
,
I
must
not
have
you
angry
with
Lady
Davers
;
while
you
are
so
good
to
me
,
'
tis
all
nothing
;
only
the
trouble
I
have
that
I
can
not
be
suffered
to
shew
how
much
I
honoured
her
ladyship
,
as
your
sister
.
  
<EOS>
Well
,
said
he
,
you
need
not
be
afraid
to
tell
me
:
I
must
love
her
after
all
;
though
I
shall
not
be
pleased
with
her
on
this
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
it
is
her
love
for
me
,
<EOS>
though
thus
oddly
expressed
,
that
makes
her
so
uneasy
:
and
,
after
all
,
she
comes
,
I
'm
sure
,
to
be
reconciled
to
me
;
though
it
must
be
through
a
good
hearty
quarrel
first
:
for
she
can
shew
a
good
deal
of
sunshine
;
but
it
must
be
always
after
a
storm
;
and
I
'll
love
her
dearly
,
if
she
has
not
been
,
and
will
not
be
,
too
hard
upon
my
dearest
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Peters
said
,
Sir
,
you
are
very
good
,
and
very
kind
;
I
love
to
see
this
complaisance
to
your
sister
,
though
she
be
in
fault
,
so
long
as
you
can
shew
it
with
so
much
justice
to
the
sweetest
innocence
and
merit
in
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
By
all
that
's
good
,
Mr.
Peters
,
said
he
,
I
'd
present
my
sister
with
a
thousand
pounds
,
if
she
would
kindly
take
my
dear
Pamela
by
the
hand
,
and
wish
her
joy
,
and
call
her
sister
!
 
<EOS>
And
yet
I
should
be
unworthy
of
the
dear
creature
that
smiles
upon
me
there
,
if
it
was
not
principally
for
her
sake
,
and
the
pleasure
it
would
give
her
,
that
I
say
this
:
for
I
will
never
be
thoroughly
reconciled
to
my
sister
till
she
does
;
for
I
most
sincerely
think
,
as
to
myself
,
that
my
dear
wife
,
there
she
sits
,
does
me
more
honour
in
her
new
relation
,
than
she
receives
from
me
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
,
said
I
,
I
am
overwhelmed
with
your
goodness
!
 
<EOS>
And
my
eyes
were
filled
with
tears
of
joy
and
gratitude
:
and
all
the
company
with
one
voice
blessed
him
.
 
<EOS>
And
Lady
Jones
was
pleased
to
say
,
The
behaviour
of
you
two
happy
ones
,
to
each
other
,
is
the
most
edifying
I
ever
knew
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
always
improved
when
I
see
you
.
 
<EOS>
How
happy
would
every
good
lady
be
with
such
a
gentleman
,
and
every
good
gentleman
with
such
a
lady
!
 
<EOS>
In
short
,
you
seem
made
for
one
another
.
  
<EOS>
O
madam
<EOS>
,
said
I
,
you
are
so
kind
,
so
good
to
me
,
that
I
know
not
how
to
thank
you
enough
!
 
<EOS>
Said
she
<EOS>
,
You
deserve
more
than
I
can
express
;
for
,
to
all
that
know
your
story
,
you
are
a
matchless
person
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
an
ornament
to
our
sex
and
your
virtue
,
though
Mr.
B
#
#
#
#
is
so
generous
as
he
is
,
has
met
with
no
more
than
its
due
reward
.
 
<EOS>
God
long
bless
you
together
!
  
<EOS>
You
are
,
said
my
dearest
sir
,
very
good
to
me
,
madam
,
I
am
sure
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
taken
liberties
in
my
former
life
,
that
deserved
not
so
much
excellence
.
<EOS>
I
have
offended
extremely
,
by
trials
glorious
to
my
Pamela
,
but
disgraceful
to
me
,
against
a
virtue
that
I
now
consider
as
almost
sacred
;
and
I
shall
not
think
I
deserve
her
,
till
I
can
bring
my
manners
,
my
sentiments
,
and
my
actions
,
to
a
conformity
with
her
own
.
 
<EOS>
In
short
,
my
Pamela
,
continued
he
,
I
want
you
to
be
nothing
<EOS>
but
what
you
are
,
and
have
been
.
 
<EOS>
You
can
not
be
better
;
and
if
you
could
,
it
would
be
but
filling
me
with
despair
to
attain
the
awful
heights
of
virtue
at
which
you
have
arrived
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
,
added
the
dear
gentleman
,
the
scene
I
have
beheld
within
these
twelve
hours
,
has
made
me
more
serious
than
otherwise
<EOS>
I
should
have
been
:
<EOS>
but
I
'll
assure
you
,
before
all
this
good
company
<EOS>
,
I
speak
the
sentiments
of
my
heart
,
and
those
not
of
this
day
only
.
  
<EOS>
What
a
happy
daughter
is
yours
,
O
my
dear
father
and
mother
!
 
<EOS>
I
owe
it
all
to
God
's
grace
,
and
to
yours
and
my
good
lady
's
instructions
<EOS>
:
And
to
these
let
me
always
look
back
with
grateful
acknowledgments
,
that
I
may
not
impute
to
myself
,
and
be
proud
,
my
inexpressible
happiness
.
  
<EOS>
The
company
were
so
kindly
pleased
with
our
concern
,
and
my
dear
master
's
goodness
,
that
he
,
observing
their
indulgence
,
and
being
himself
curious
to
know
the
further
particulars
of
what
had
passed
between
my
lady
and
me
,
repeated
his
question
,
What
she
had
called
me
besides
wench
and
creature
?
 
<EOS>
And
I
said
,
My
lady
,
supposing
I
was
wicked
,
lamented
over
me
,
very
kindly
,
my
depravity
and
fall
,
and
said
,
What
a
thousand
pities
it
was
,
so
much
virtue
,
as
she
was
pleased
to
say
,
was
so
destroyed
;
and
that
I
had
yielded
,
after
so
noble
a
stand
!
<EOS>
as
she
said
.
  
<EOS>
Excuse
me
,
gentlemen
and
ladies
,
said
I
!
<EOS>
you
know
my
story
,
it
seems
;
and
I
am
commanded
,
by
one
who
has
a
title
to
all
my
obedience
,
to
proceed
.
  
<EOS>
They
gave
all
of
them
bows
of
approbation
,
that
they
might
not
interrupt
me
;
and
I
continued
my
story
 
the
men
-
servants
withdrawing
,
at
a
motion
of
Mr.
B
#
#
#
#
,
on
my
looking
towards
them
:
and
then
,
at
Lady
Darnford
's
coming
in
,
I
proceeded
.
  
<EOS>
I
told
her
ladyship
,
that
I
was
still
innocent
,
and
would
be
so
,
and
it
was
injurious
to
suppose
me
otherwise
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
tell
me
,
wench
,
said
she
 
<EOS>
But
I
think
I
must
not
tell
you
what
she
said
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
do
,
said
my
master
,
to
clear
my
sister
;
we
shall
think
it
very
bad
else
.
  
<EOS>
I
held
my
hand
before
my
face
 
<EOS>
Why
,
she
said
,
Tell
me
,
wench
,
<EOS>
hast
thou
not
been
 
hesitating
 
a
very
free
creature
with
thy
master
?
 
<EOS>
That
she
said
,
or
to
that
effect
 
<EOS>
And
when
I
said
,
She
asked
strange
questions
,
and
in
strange
words
,
she
ridiculed
my
delicacy
,
as
she
called
it
;
and
said
,
My
niceness
would
not
last
long
.
 
<EOS>
She
said
,
I
must
know
I
was
not
really
married
,
that
my
ring
was
only
a
sham
,
and
all
was
my
cunning
to
cloak
my
yielding
,
and
get
better
terms
.
 
<EOS>
She
said
,
She
knew
the
world
as
much
at
thirty
-
two
,
as
I
did
at
sixteen
;
and
bid
me
remember
that
.
  
<EOS>
I
took
the
liberty
to
say
,
(
but
I
got
a
good
way
off
,
)
that
I
scorned
her
ladyship
's
words
,
and
was
as
much
married
as
her
ladyship
.
 
<EOS>
And
then
I
had
certainly
been
cuffed
,
if
her
woman
had
not
interposed
,
and
told
her
I
was
not
worthy
her
anger
;
and
that
I
was
as
much
to
be
pitied
for
my
credulity
,
as
despised
for
my
vanity
.
  
<EOS>
My
poor
Pamela
,
said
my
master
,
this
was
too
,
too
hard
upon
you
!
 
<EOS>
O
sir
,
said
I
,
how
much
easier
it
was
to
me
than
if
it
had
been
so
!
 
<EOS>
That
would
have
broken
my
heart
quite
!
 
<EOS>
For
then
I
should
have
deserved
it
all
,
and
worse
;
and
these
reproaches
,
added
to
my
own
guilt
,
would
have
made
me
truly
wretched
!
  
<EOS>
Lady
Darnford
,
at
whose
right
-
hand
<EOS>
I
sat
,
kissed
me
with
a
kind
of
rapture
,
and
called
me
a
sweet
exemplar
for
all
my
sex
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Peters
said
very
handsome
things
;
so
did
Mr.
Perry
and
Sir
Simon
,
with
tears
in
his
eyes
,
said
to
my
master
,
Why
,
neighbour
,
neighbour
,
this
is
excellent
,
by
my
troth
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
there
is
something
in
virtue
,
that
we
had
not
well
considered
.
 
<EOS>
On
my
soul
,
there
has
been
but
one
angel
come
down
for
these
thousand
years
,
and
you
have
got
her
.
  
<EOS>
Well
,
my
dearest
,
said
my
master
,
pray
proceed
with
your
story
until
,
we
have
done
supper
,
since
the
ladies
seem
pleased
with
it
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
sir
,
said
I
,
her
ladyship
went
on
in
the
same
manner
;
but
said
,
one
time
,
(
and
held
me
by
the
hand
,
)
she
would
give
me
an
hundred
guineas
for
one
provoking
word
;
or
,
if
I
would
but
say
I
believed
myself
married
,
that
she
might
fell
me
at
her
foot
:
<EOS>
But
,
sir
,
you
must
not
be
angry
with
her
ladyship
.
<EOS>
She
called
me
painted
dirt
,
baby
-
face
,
waiting
-
maid
,
beggar
's
brat
,
and
beggar
-
born
;
but
I
said
,
As
long
as
I
knew
my
innocence
,
I
was
easy
in
every
thing
,
but
to
have
my
dear
parents
abused
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
never
beggars
,
nor
beholden
to
any
body
;
nor
to
any
thing
but
God
's
grace
and
their
own
labour
;
that
they
once
lived
in
credit
;
that
misfortunes
might
befall
any
body
;
and
that
I
could
not
bear
they
should
be
treated
so
undeservedly
.
  
<EOS>
Then
her
ladyship
said
,
Ay
,
she
supposed
my
master
's
folly
would
make
us
set
up
for
a
family
,
and
that
the
heralds
'
office
would
shortly
be
searched
to
make
it
out
.
  
<EOS>
Exactly
my
sister
again
!
<EOS>
said
he
.
 
<EOS>
So
you
could
not
please
her
any
way
?
  
<EOS>
No
,
indeed
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
When
she
commanded
me
to
fill
her
a
glass
of
wine
,
and
would
not
let
her
woman
do
it
,
she
asked
,
If
I
was
above
it
?
 
<EOS>
I
then
said
,
If
to
attend
your
ladyship
at
table
,
or
even
kneel
at
your
feet
,
was
required
of
me
<EOS>
,
I
would
most
gladly
do
it
,
were
I
only
the
person
you
think
me
.
 
<EOS>
But
if
it
be
to
triumph
over
one
,
who
has
received
honours
which
she
thinks
require
from
her
another
part
,
that
she
may
not
be
utterly
unworthy
of
them
<EOS>
,
I
must
say
,
I
can
not
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
This
quite
astonished
her
ladyship
;
and
a
little
before
,
her
kinsman
brought
me
the
bottle
and
glass
,
and
required
me
to
fill
it
for
my
lady
,
at
her
command
,
and
called
himself
my
deputy
:
<EOS>
And
I
said
,
'
Tis
in
a
good
hand
;
help
my
lady
yourself
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
sir
,
added
I
,
<EOS>
you
see
I
could
be
a
little
saucy
upon
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
You
please
me
well
,
my
Pamela
,
said
he
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
quite
right
.
 
<EOS>
But
proceed
.
  
<EOS>
Her
ladyship
said
,
She
was
astonished
!
<EOS>
adding
,
She
supposed
I
would
have
her
look
upon
me
as
her
brother
's
wife
:
And
asked
me
,
What
,
in
the
name
of
impudence
,
possessed
me
,
to
dare
to
look
upon
myself
as
her
sister
?
<EOS>
And
I
said
,
That
was
a
question
better
became
her
most
worthy
brother
to
answer
,
than
me
.
 
<EOS>
And
then
I
thought
I
should
have
had
her
ladyship
upon
me
;
but
her
woman
interposed
.
  
<EOS>
I
afterwards
told
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
at
the
window
,
that
since
I
was
hindered
from
going
to
you
,
I
believed
it
was
best
to
let
Robert
go
with
the
chariot
,
and
say
,
Lady
Davers
was
come
,
and
I
could
not
leave
her
ladyship
.
 
<EOS>
But
this
did
not
please
;
<EOS>
and
I
thought
it
would
too
;
for
she
said
,
No
,
<EOS>
no
,
he
'll
think
I
make
the
creature
my
companion
,
and
know
not
how
to
part
with
her
.
  
<EOS>
Exactly
,
said
he
,
my
sister
again
.
  
<EOS>
And
she
said
,
I
knew
nothing
what
belonged
to
people
of
condition
;
how
should
I
?
 
<EOS>
What
shall
I
say
,
madam
?
<EOS>
said
<EOS>
I.
 
Nothing
at
all
,
answered
she
;
let
him
expect
his
dearest
love
,
alluding
to
your
kind
epithet
in
your
letter
,
and
be
disappointed
;
it
is
but
adding
a
few
more
hours
to
this
heavy
absence
,
and
every
one
will
become
a
day
in
his
amorous
account
.
  
<EOS>
So
,
to
be
short
,
I
saw
nothing
was
to
be
done
;
and
I
feared
,
sir
,
you
would
wonder
at
my
stay
,
and
be
angry
;
and
I
watched
my
opportunity
,
till
my
lady
,
who
was
walking
about
the
room
,
was
at
the
further
end
;
and
the
parlour
being
a
ground
-
floor
,
in
a
manner
,
I
jumped
out
at
the
window
,
and
ran
for
it
.
  
<EOS>
Her
ladyship
called
after
me
;
so
did
her
woman
;
and
I
heard
her
say
,
I
flew
like
a
bird
;
and
she
called
two
of
her
servants
in
sight
to
stop
me
;
but
I
said
,
Touch
me
at
your
peril
,
fellows
!
 
<EOS>
And
Mr.
Colbrand
,
having
been
planted
at
hand
by
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
(
who
was
very
good
in
the
whole
affair
,
and
incurred
her
ladyship
's
displeasure
,
once
or
twice
,
by
taking
my
part
,
)
seeing
how
I
was
used
,
put
on
a
fierce
look
,
cocked
his
hat
with
one
hand
,
and
put
t'other
on
his
sword
,
and
said
,
he
would
chine
the
man
who
offered
to
touch
his
lady
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
he
ran
alongside
of
me
,
and
could
hardly
keep
pace
with
me
:
 
<EOS>
And
here
,
my
dear
sir
,
concluded
I
<EOS>
,
I
am
,
at
yours
and
the
good
company
's
service
.
  
<EOS>
They
seemed
highly
pleased
with
my
relation
;
and
my
master
said
,
he
was
glad
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
behaved
so
well
,
as
also
Mr.
Colbrand
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
sir
,
said
I
:
<EOS>
when
Mrs.
Jewkes
interposed
once
,
her
ladyship
said
,
It
was
hard
,
she
,
who
was
born
in
that
house
,
could
not
have
some
privilege
in
it
,
without
being
talked
to
by
the
saucy
servants
.
 
<EOS>
And
she
called
her
another
time
fat
-
face
,
and
womaned
her
most
violently
.
  
<EOS>
Well
,
said
my
master
,
I
am
glad
,
my
dear
,
you
have
had
such
an
escape
.
<EOS>
My
sister
was
always
passionate
,
as
Mrs.
Peters
knows
:
And
my
poor
mother
had
enough
to
do
with
us
both
.
 
<EOS>
For
we
neither
of
us
wanted
spirit
:
and
when
I
was
a
boy
,
I
never
came
home
from
school
or
college
for
a
few
days
,
but
though
we
longed
to
see
one
another
before
,
yet
ere
the
first
day
was
over
,
we
had
a
quarrel
;
for
she
,
being
seven
years
older
than
I
,
was
always
for
domineering
over
me
,
and
I
could
not
bear
it
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
used
,
on
her
frequently
quarrelling
with
the
maids
,
and
being
always
at
a
word
and
a
blow
,
to
call
her
Captain
Bab
;
for
her
name
is
Barbara
.
 
<EOS>
And
when
my
Lord
Davers
courted
her
,
my
poor
mother
has
made
up
quarrels
between
them
three
times
in
a
day
;
and
I
used
to
tell
her
<EOS>
,
she
would
certainly
beat
her
husband
,
marry
whom
she
would
,
if
he
did
not
beat
her
first
,
and
break
her
spirit
.
  
<EOS>
Yet
has
she
,
continued
he
,
very
good
qualities
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
a
dutiful
daughter
,
is
a
good
wife
;
she
is
bountiful
to
her
servants
,
firm
in
her
friendships
,
charitable
to
the
poor
,
and
,
I
believe
,
never
any
sister
better
loved
a
brother
,
than
she
me
:
<EOS>
and
yet
she
always
loved
to
vex
and
tease
me
;
and
as
I
would
bear
a
resentment
longer
than
she
,
she
'd
be
one
moment
the
most
provoking
creature
in
the
world
,
and
the
next
would
do
any
thing
to
be
forgiven
;
and
I
have
made
her
,
when
she
was
the
aggressor
,
follow
me
all
over
the
house
and
garden
to
be
upon
good
terms
with
me
.
  
<EOS>
But
this
case
piques
her
more
,
because
she
had
found
out
a
match
for
me
in
the
family
of
a
person
of
quality
,
and
had
set
her
heart
upon
bringing
it
to
effect
,
and
had
even
proceeded
far
in
it
,
without
my
knowledge
,
and
brought
me
into
the
lady
's
company
,
unknowing
of
her
design
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
was
then
averse
to
matrimony
upon
any
terms
;
and
was
angry
at
her
proceeding
in
it
so
far
without
my
privity
or
encouragement
:
<EOS>
And
she
can
not
,
for
this
reason
,
bear
the
thoughts
of
my
being
now
married
,
and
to
her
mother
's
waiting
-
maid
too
,
as
she
reminds
my
dear
Pamela
,
when
I
had
declined
her
proposal
with
the
daughter
of
a
noble
earl
.
  
<EOS>
This
is
the
whole
case
,
said
he
;
and
,
allowing
for
the
pride
and
violence
of
her
spirit
,
and
that
she
knows
not
,
<EOS>
as
I
do
,
the
transcendent
excellencies
of
my
dear
Pamela
,
and
that
all
her
view
,
in
her
own
conception
,
is
mine
and
the
family
honour
<EOS>
,
she
is
a
little
to
be
allowed
for
:
Though
,
never
fear
,
my
Pamela
,
but
that
I
,
who
never
had
a
struggle
with
her
,
wherein
I
did
not
get
the
better
,
will
do
you
justice
,
and
myself
too
.
  
<EOS>
This
account
of
Lady
Davers
pleased
every
body
,
and
was
far
from
being
to
her
ladyship
's
disadvantage
in
the
main
;
and
I
would
do
any
thing
in
the
world
to
have
the
honour
to
be
in
her
good
graces
:
<EOS>
Yet
I
fear
it
will
not
be
easily
,
if
at
all
,
effected
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
will
proceed
.
  
<EOS>
After
supper
,
nothing
would
serve
Miss
Darnford
and
Miss
Boroughs
,
but
we
must
have
a
dance
;
and
Mr.
Peters
,
who
plays
a
good
fiddle
,
urged
it
forward
.
 
<EOS>
My
dear
master
,
though
in
a
riding
-
dress
,
took
out
Miss
Boroughs
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Simon
,
for
a
man
of
his
years
,
danced
well
,
and
took
me
out
;
but
put
on
one
of
his
free
jokes
,
that
I
was
fitter
to
dance
with
a
younger
man
;
and
he
would
have
it
,
(
though
I
had
not
danced
since
my
dear
lady
's
death
to
signify
,
except
once
or
twice
to
please
Mrs.
Jervis
,
and
,
indeed
,
believed
all
my
dancing
days
over
,
)
that
as
my
master
and
I
were
the
best
dancers
,
we
should
dance
once
together
,
before
folks
,
as
the
odd
gentleman
said
;
and
my
dear
sir
was
pleased
to
oblige
him
:
And
afterwards
danced
with
Miss
Darnford
,
who
has
much
more
skill
and
judgment
than
I
;
though
they
compliment
me
with
an
easier
shape
and
air
.
  
<EOS>
We
left
the
company
with
great
difficulty
at
about
eleven
,
my
dear
master
having
been
up
all
night
before
,
and
we
being
at
the
greatest
distance
from
home
;
though
they
seemed
inclinable
not
to
break
up
so
soon
,
as
they
were
neighbours
;
and
the
ladies
said
,
They
longed
to
hear
what
would
be
the
end
of
Lady
Davers
's
interview
with
her
brother
.
  
<EOS>
My
master
said
,
He
feared
we
must
not
now
think
of
going
next
day
to
Bedfordshire
,
as
we
had
intended
;
and
perhaps
might
see
them
again
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
we
took
leave
,
and
set
out
for
home
;
where
we
arrived
not
till
twelve
o'clock
;
and
found
Lady
Davers
had
gone
to
bed
about
eleven
,
wanting
sadly
that
we
should
come
home
first
;
but
so
did
not
I.
  
Mrs.
Jewkes
told
us
,
That
my
lady
was
sadly
fretted
that
I
had
got
away
so
;
and
seemed
a
little
apprehensive
of
what
I
would
say
of
the
usage
I
had
received
from
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
asked
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
if
she
thought
I
was
really
married
?
 
<EOS>
And
Mrs.
Jewkes
telling
her
<EOS>
yes
,
she
fell
into
a
passion
,
and
said
,
Begone
,
bold
woman
,
I
can
not
bear
thee
!
 
<EOS>
See
not
my
face
till
I
send
for
thee
!
 
<EOS>
Thou
hast
been
very
impudent
to
me
once
or
twice
to
-
day
already
,
and
art
now
worse
than
ever
.
 
<EOS>
She
said
,
She
would
not
have
told
her
ladyship
,
if
she
had
not
asked
her
;
and
was
sorry
she
had
offended
.
  
<EOS>
She
sent
for
her
at
supper
time
:
Said
she
,
I
have
another
question
to
ask
thee
,
woman
,
and
tell
me
yes
,
if
thou
darest
.
 
<EOS>
Was
ever
any
thing
so
odd
?
 
<EOS>
Why
then
,
said
Mrs.
Jewkes
<EOS>
,
I
will
say
<EOS>
No
,
before
your
ladyship
speaks
.
 
<EOS>
My
master
laughed
:
<EOS>
Poor
woman
!
<EOS>
said
he
.
 
<EOS>
She
called
her
insolent
,
and
assurance
;
and
said
,
Begone
,
bold
woman
as
thou
art
!
 
but
come
hither
.
 
<EOS>
Dost
thou
know
if
that
young
harlot
is
to
be
with
my
brother
to
-
night
?
  
<EOS>
She
said
she
knew
not
what
to
answer
,
because
she
had
threatened
her
if
she
said
yes
.
 
<EOS>
But
at
last
my
lady
said
,
I
will
know
the
bottom
of
this
iniquity
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
they
wo
n't
have
so
much
impudence
to
be
together
while
I
'm
in
the
house
;
but
I
dare
say
they
have
been
bed
-
fellows
.
  
<EOS>
Said
she
,
I
will
lie
to
-
night
in
the
room
I
was
born
in
;
so
get
that
bed
ready
.
 
<EOS>
That
room
being
our
bedchamber
<EOS>
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
after
some
hesitation
,
replied
,
Madam
,
my
master
lies
there
,
and
has
the
key
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
,
woman
,
said
she
,
thou
tellest
me
a
story
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
madam
,
said
she
,
he
does
;
and
has
some
papers
there
<EOS>
he
will
let
nobody
see
;
for
Mrs.
Jewkes
said
,
she
feared
she
would
beat
her
if
she
went
up
,
and
found
by
my
clothes
,
and
some
of
my
master
's
,
how
it
was
.
  
<EOS>
So
she
said
,
I
will
then
lie
in
the
best
room
,
as
it
is
called
;
and
Jackey
shall
lie
in
the
little
green
room
adjoining
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
Has
thy
master
got
the
keys
of
those
?
 
<EOS>
No
,
madam
<EOS>
,
said
Mrs.
Jewkes
:
I
will
order
them
to
be
made
ready
for
your
ladyship
.
  
<EOS>
And
where
dost
thou
lay
they
pursy
sides
?
<EOS>
said
she
.
 
<EOS>
Up
two
pair
of
stairs
,
madam
,
next
the
garden
.
 
<EOS>
And
where
lies
the
young
harlotry
?
<EOS>
continued
she
.
 
<EOS>
Sometimes
with
me
,
madam
,
said
she
.
 
<EOS>
And
sometimes
with
thy
virtuous
master
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
said
my
lady
.
 
<EOS>
Ha
,
woman
!
<EOS>
what
sayest
thou
?
 
<EOS>
I
must
not
speak
,
said
Mrs.
Jewkes
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
thou
mayest
go
,
said
she
;
but
thou
hast
the
air
of
a
secret
keeper
of
that
sort
I
dare
say
thoul't
<EOS>
set
the
good
work
forward
most
cordially
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
said
my
master
,
and
laughed
most
heartily
.
  
<EOS>
This
talk
we
had
whilst
we
were
undressing
.
 
<EOS>
So
she
and
her
woman
lay
together
in
the
room
my
master
lay
in
before
I
was
happy
.
  
<EOS>
I
said
,
Dear
sir
,
pray
,
in
the
morning
let
me
lock
myself
up
in
the
closet
,
as
soon
as
you
rise
;
and
not
be
called
down
for
ever
so
much
;
for
I
am
afraid
to
see
her
ladyship
:
<EOS>
And
I
will
employ
myself
about
my
journal
,
while
these
things
are
in
my
head
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
be
afraid
,
my
dear
,
said
he
:
<EOS>
Am
not
I
with
you
?
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
pitied
me
for
what
I
had
undergone
in
the
day
;
and
I
said
,
We
wo
n't
make
the
worst
of
it
to
my
dear
master
,
because
we
wo
n't
exasperate
where
we
would
reconcile
:
<EOS>
but
,
added
I
<EOS>
,
I
am
much
obliged
to
you
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
and
I
thank
you
.
 
<EOS>
Said
my
master
<EOS>
,
I
hope
she
did
not
beat
your
lady
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
?
 
<EOS>
Not
much
,
sir
,
said
she
;
but
I
believe
I
saved
my
lady
once
:
Yet
,
added
she
,
I
was
most
vexed
at
the
young
lord

<EOS>
Ay
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
said
my
master
,
let
me
know
his
behaviour
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
chastise
him
,
though
I
can
not
my
sister
,
who
is
a
woman
;
let
me
therefore
know
the
part
he
acted
.
  
<EOS>
Nothing
,
my
dear
sir
,
said
I
,
but
impertinence
,
if
I
may
so
say
,
and
foolishness
,
that
was
very
provoking
;
but
I
spared
him
not
;
and
so
there
is
no
room
,
sir
,
for
your
anger
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
sir
,
said
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
nothing
else
indeed
.
  
<EOS>
How
was
her
woman
?
<EOS>
said
my
master
.
 
<EOS>
Pretty
impertinent
,
replied
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
as
ladies
'
women
will
be
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
said
I
,
<EOS>
you
know
she
saved
me
once
or
twice
.
 
<EOS>
Very
true
,
madam
,
returned
Mrs.
Jewkes
.
 
<EOS>
And
she
said
to
me
at
table
,
that
you
were
a
sweet
creature
;
she
never
saw
your
equal
;
but
that
you
had
a
spirit
;
and
she
was
sorry
<EOS>
you
answered
her
lady
<EOS>
so
,
who
never
bore
so
much
contradiction
before
.
 
<EOS>
I
told
her
,
added
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
that
if
I
was
in
your
ladyship
's
place
,
I
should
have
taken
much
more
upon
me
,
and
that
you
were
all
sweetness
.
 
<EOS>
And
she
said
,
<EOS>
I
was
got
over
,
she
saw
.
  
<EOS>
Tuesday
morning
,
the
sixth
of
my
happiness
.
  
<EOS>
My
master
had
said
to
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
that
he
should
not
rise
till
eight
or
nine
,
as
he
had
sat
up
all
the
night
before
:
<EOS>
but
it
seems
,
<EOS>
my
lady
,
knowing
he
usually
rose
about
six
,
got
up
soon
after
that
hour
;
raised
her
woman
and
her
nephew
;
having
a
whimsical
scheme
in
her
head
,
to
try
to
find
whether
we
were
in
bed
together
:
<EOS>
And
,
about
half
an
hour
after
six
,
she
rapped
at
our
chamber
door
.
  
<EOS>
My
master
was
waked
at
the
noise
,
and
asked
,
Who
was
there
?
 
<EOS>
Open
the
door
,
said
she
;
open
it
this
minute
!
 
<EOS>
I
said
,
clinging
about
his
neck
,
Dear
,
dear
sir
,
pray
,
pray
do
n't
!
 
<EOS>
O
save
me
,
save
me
!
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
fear
,
Pamela
,
said
he
.
 
<EOS>
The
woman
's
mad
,
I
believe
.
  
<EOS>
But
he
called
out
;
Who
are
you
?
 
<EOS>
What
do
you
want
?
 
<EOS>
You
know
my
voice
well
enough
,
said
she
:
 
I
will
come
in
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
,
sir
,
said
I
,
do
n't
let
her
ladyship
in
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
be
frightened
,
my
dear
,
said
he
;
she
thinks
we
are
not
married
,
and
are
afraid
to
be
found
a
-
bed
together
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
let
her
in
;
but
she
sha
n't
come
near
my
dearest
.
  
<EOS>
So
he
slipt
out
of
bed
,
and
putting
on
some
of
his
clothes
,
and
gown
and
slippers
,
he
said
,
What
bold
body
dare
disturb
my
repose
thus
?
<EOS>
and
opened
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
In
rushed
she
<EOS>
:
I
'll
see
your
wickedness
,
said
she
,
I
will
!
 
<EOS>
In
vain
shall
you
think
to
hide
it
from
me
.
 
<EOS>
What
should
I
hide
?
<EOS>
said
he
.
<EOS>
How
dare
you
set
a
foot
into
my
house
,
after
the
usage
I
have
received
from
you
?
 
<EOS>
I
had
covered
myself
over
head
and
ears
,
and
trembled
every
joint
.
 
<EOS>
He
looked
,
and
"
spied
her
woman
and
kinsman
in
the
room
<EOS>
,
she
crying
out
,
Bear
witness
,
Jackey
;
bear
witness
,
Beck
;
the
creature
is
now
in
his
bed
!
 
<EOS>
And
not
seeing
the
young
gentleman
before
,
who
was
at
the
feet
of
the
bed
,
he
said
,
How
now
,
sir
?
 
<EOS>
What
's
your
business
in
this
apartment
?
 
<EOS>
Begone
this
moment
!
 
<EOS>
And
he
went
away
directly
.
  
<EOS>
Beck
,
said
my
lady
,
you
see
the
creature
is
in
his
bed
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
,
madam
,
answered
she
.
 
<EOS>
My
master
came
to
me
,
and
said
,
Ay
,
look
,
Beck
,
and
bear
witness
:
Here
is
my
Pamela
!
 
<EOS>
My
dear
angel
,
my
lovely
creature
,
do
n't
be
afraid
;
look
up
,
and
see
how
frantickly
this
woman
of
quality
behaves
.
  
<EOS>
At
that
,
I
just
peeped
,
and
saw
my
lady
,
who
could
not
bear
this
,
coming
to
me
;
and
she
said
,
<EOS>
Wicked
abandoned
wretch
!
 
<EOS>
Vile
brother
,
to
brave
me
thus
!
 
<EOS>
I
'll
tear
the
creature
out
of
bed
before
your
face
,
and
expose
you
both
as
you
deserve
.
  
<EOS>
At
that
he
took
her
in
his
arms
,
as
if
she
had
been
nothing
;
and
carrying
her
out
of
the
room
,
she
cried
out
,
Beck
!
<EOS>
Beck
!
<EOS>
help
me
,
Beck
!
<EOS>
the
wretch
is
going
to
fling
me
down
stairs
!
 
<EOS>
Her
woman
ran
to
him
,
and
said
,
Good
sir
,
for
Heaven
's
sake
do
no
violence
to
my
lady
!
 
<EOS>
Her
ladyship
has
been
ill
all
night
.
  
<EOS>
He
sat
her
down
in
the
chamber
she
lay
in
,
and
she
could
not
speak
for
passion
.
 
<EOS>
Take
care
of
your
lady
,
said
he
;
and
when
she
has
rendered
herself
more
worthy
of
my
attention
,
I
'll
see
her
;
till
then
,
at
her
peril
,
and
yours
too
,
come
not
near
my
apartment
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
he
came
to
me
,
and
,
with
all
the
sweet
soothing
words
in
the
world
,
pacified
my
fears
,
and
gave
me
leave
to
go
to
write
in
my
closet
,
as
soon
as
my
fright
was
over
,
and
to
stay
there
till
things
were
more
calm
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
he
dressed
himself
,
and
went
out
of
the
chamber
,
permitting
me
,
at
my
desire
,
to
fasten
the
door
after
him
.
  
<EOS>
At
breakfast
-
time
my
master
tapped
at
the
door
,
and
I
said
,
Who
's
there
?
<EOS>
I
,
my
dearest
,
said
he
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
then
,
replied
I
,
I
will
open
it
with
pleasure
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
written
on
a
good
deal
;
but
I
put
it
by
,
when
I
ran
to
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
have
locked
it
again
,
when
he
was
in
;
but
he
said
,
Am
not
I
here
?
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
be
afraid
.
 
<EOS>
Said
he
,
Will
you
come
down
to
breakfast
,
my
love
?
 
<EOS>
O
no
,
dear
sir
,
said
I
;
be
pleased
to
excuse
me
!
<EOS>
said
he
,
I
can
not
bear
the
look
of
it
,
that
the
mistress
of
my
house
should
breakfast
in
her
closet
,
as
if
she
durst
not
come
down
,
and
I
at
home
!
  
<EOS>
O
,
dearest
sir
,
replied
I
<EOS>
,
pray
pass
that
over
,
for
my
sake
;
and
do
n't
let
my
presence
aggravate
your
sister
,
for
a
kind
punctilio
!
 
<EOS>
Then
,
my
dear
,
said
he
,
I
will
breakfast
with
you
here
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
pray
,
dear
sir
,
answered
I
,
breakfast
with
your
sister
.
 
<EOS>
That
,
my
dear
,
replied
he
,
will
too
much
gratify
her
pride
,
and
look
like
a
slight
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
Dear
sir
,
said
I
,
your
goodness
is
too
great
,
for
me
to
want
punctilious
proofs
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
oblige
her
ladyship
.
 
<EOS>
She
is
your
guest
surely
,
sir
,
you
may
be
freest
with
your
dutiful
wife
!
  
<EOS>
She
is
a
strange
woman
,
said
he
:
<EOS>
How
I
pity
her
!
 
<EOS>
She
has
thrown
herself
into
a
violent
fit
of
the
colic
,
through
passion
:
And
is
but
now
,
her
woman
says
,
a
little
easier
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
,
sir
,
said
I
,
when
you
carried
her
ladyship
out
,
you
did
not
hurt
her
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
replied
he
,
I
love
her
too
well
.
<EOS>
I
set
her
down
in
the
apartment
she
had
chosen
:
and
she
but
now
desires
to
see
me
,
and
that
I
will
breakfast
with
her
,
or
refuses
to
touch
any
thing
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
if
my
dearest
please
,
I
will
insist
it
shall
be
with
you
at
the
same
time
.
  
<EOS>
O
,
no
,
no
,
dear
sir
!
<EOS>
said
I
;
I
should
not
forgive
myself
,
if
I
did
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
on
my
knees
beg
her
ladyship
's
goodness
to
me
,
now
I
am
in
your
presence
;
though
I
thought
I
ought
to
carry
it
a
little
stiff
when
you
were
absent
,
for
the
sake
of
the
honour
you
have
done
me
.
 
<EOS>
And
,
dear
sir
,
if
my
deepest
humility
will
please
,
permit
me
to
shew
it
.
  
<EOS>
You
shall
do
nothing
,
returned
he
,
unworthy
of
my
wife
,
to
please
the
proud
woman
!
 
<EOS>
But
I
will
,
however
,
permit
you
to
breakfast
by
yourself
this
once
,
as
I
have
not
seen
her
since
I
have
used
her
in
so
barbarous
a
manner
,
as
I
understand
she
exclaims
I
have
;
and
as
she
will
not
eat
any
thing
,
unless
I
give
her
my
company
.
 
<EOS>
So
he
saluted
me
,
and
withdrew
;
and
I
locked
the
door
after
him
again
for
fear
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
soon
after
rapped
at
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
Who
's
there
?
<EOS>
said
I.
 
<EOS>
Only
I
,
madam
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
opened
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
a
sad
thing
,
madam
,
said
she
,
you
should
be
so
much
afraid
in
your
own
house
.
 
<EOS>
She
brought
me
some
chocolate
and
toast
;
and
I
asked
her
about
my
lady
's
behaviour
.
 
<EOS>
She
said
,
she
would
not
suffer
any
body
to
attend
but
her
woman
,
because
she
would
not
be
heard
what
she
had
to
say
;
but
she
believed
,
she
said
,
her
master
was
very
angry
with
the
young
lord
,
as
she
called
her
kinsman
;
for
,
as
she
passed
by
the
door
,
she
heard
him
say
,
in
a
high
tone
,
I
hope
,
sir
,
you
did
not
forget
what
belongs
to
the
character
you
assume
;
or
to
that
effect
.
  
<EOS>
About
one
o'clock
my
master
came
up
again
,
and
he
said
,
Will
you
come
down
to
dinner
,
Pamela
,
when
I
send
for
you
?
 
<EOS>
Whatever
you
command
,
sir
,
I
must
do
.
 
<EOS>
But
my
lady
wo
n't
desire
to
see
me
.
 
<EOS>
No
matter
whether
she
will
or
no
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
will
not
suffer
,
that
she
shall
prescribe
her
insolent
will
to
my
wife
,
and
in
your
own
house
too
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
,
by
my
tenderness
to
you
,
mortify
her
pride
;
and
it
can
not
be
done
so
well
as
to
her
face
.
  
<EOS>
Dearest
sir
,
said
I
,
pray
indulge
me
,
and
let
me
dine
here
by
myself
.
 
<EOS>
It
will
make
my
lady
but
more
inveterate
.
 
<EOS>
Said
he
<EOS>
,
I
have
told
her
we
are
married
.
 
<EOS>
She
is
out
of
all
patience
about
it
,
and
yet
pretends
not
to
believe
it
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
that
I
tell
her
,
Then
she
shall
have
it
her
own
way
,
and
that
I
am
not
.
 
<EOS>
And
what
has
she
to
do
with
it
either
way
?
 
<EOS>
She
has
scolded
and
begged
,
commanded
and
prayed
,
blessed
me
,
and
cursed
me
,
by
turns
,
twenty
times
in
these
few
hours
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
have
sometimes
soothed
her
,
sometimes
raged
;
and
at
last
left
her
,
and
took
a
turn
in
the
garden
for
an
hour
to
compose
myself
,
because
you
should
not
see
how
the
foolish
woman
has
ruffled
me
;
and
just
now
I
came
out
,
seeing
her
coming
in
.
  
<EOS>
Just
as
he
had
said
so
,
I
cried
,
Oh
!
<EOS>
my
lady
,
my
lady
!
<EOS>
for
I
heard
her
voice
in
the
chamber
,
saying
,
Brother
,
brother
,
one
word
with
you
 
stopping
in
sight
of
the
closet
where
I
was
.
 
<EOS>
He
stepped
out
,
and
she
went
up
to
the
window
that
looks
towards
the
garden
,
and
said
,
<EOS>
Mean
fool
that
I
am
,
to
follow
you
up
and
down
the
house
in
this
manner
,
though
I
am
shunned
and
avoided
by
you
!
 
<EOS>
You
a
brother
!
 
<EOS>
You
a
barbarian
!
 
<EOS>
Is
it
possible
<EOS>
we
could
be
born
of
one
mother
?
  
<EOS>
Why
,
said
he
,
do
you
charge
me
with
a
conduct
to
you
,
that
you
bring
upon
yourself
?
 
<EOS>
Is
it
not
surprising
that
you
should
take
the
liberty
with
me
,
that
the
dear
mother
you
have
named
never
gave
you
an
example
for
to
any
of
her
relations
?
 
<EOS>
Was
it
not
sufficient
,
that
I
was
insolently
taken
to
task
by
you
in
your
letters
,
but
my
retirements
must
be
invaded
?
 
<EOS>
My
house
insulted
?
 
<EOS>
And
,
if
I
have
one
person
dearer
to
me
than
another
,
that
that
person
must
be
singled
out
for
an
object
of
your
violence
?
  
<EOS>
Ay
,
said
she
,
that
one
person
is
the
thing
!
 
<EOS>
But
though
I
came
with
a
resolution
to
be
temperate
,
and
to
expostulate
with
you
on
your
avoiding
me
so
unkindly
,
yet
can
not
I
have
patience
to
look
upon
that
bed
in
which
I
was
born
,
and
to
be
made
the
guilty
scene
of
your
wickedness
with
such
a
   
Hush
!
<EOS>
said
he
,
I
charge
you
!
<EOS>
call
not
the
dear
girl
by
any
name
unworthy
of
her
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
not
,
as
I
told
you
,
her
excellence
;
<EOS>
and
I
desire
you
'll
not
repeat
the
freedoms
you
have
taken
below
.
  
<EOS>
She
stamped
with
her
foot
,
and
said
,
God
give
me
patience
!
 
<EOS>
So
much
contempt
to
a
sister
that
loves
you
so
well
;
and
so
much
tenderness
to
a
vile
     
<EOS>
He
put
his
hand
before
her
mouth
:
Be
silent
,
said
he
,
once
more
,
I
charge
you
!
 
<EOS>
You
know
not
the
innocence
you
abuse
so
freely
.
 
<EOS>
I
ought
not
,
neither
will
I
bear
it
.
  
<EOS>
She
sat
down
and
fanned
herself
,
and
burst
into
tears
,
and
such
sobs
of
grief
,
or
rather
passion
,
that
grieved
me
to
hear
;
and
I
sat
and
trembled
sadly
.
  
<EOS>
He
walked
about
the
room
in
great
anger
;
and
at
last
said
,
Let
me
ask
you
,
Lady
Davers
,
why
I
am
thus
insolently
to
be
called
to
account
by
you
?
 
<EOS>
Am
I
not
independent
?
 
<EOS>
Am
I
not
of
age
?
 
<EOS>
Am
I
not
at
liberty
to
please
myself
?
 
<EOS>
Would
to
God
,
that
,
instead
of
a
woman
,
and
my
sister
,
any
man
breathing
had
dared
,
whatever
were
his
relation
under
that
of
a
father
,
to
give
himself
half
the
airs
you
have
done
!
 
<EOS>
Why
did
you
not
send
on
this
accursed
<EOS>
errand
your
lord
,
who
could
write
me
such
a
letter
as
no
gentleman
should
write
,
nor
any
gentleman
tamely
receive
?
 
<EOS>
He
should
have
seen
the
difference
.
  
<EOS>
We
all
know
,
said
she
,
that
,
since
your
Italian
duel
,
you
have
commenced
a
bravo
;
and
all
your
airs
breathe
as
strongly
of
the
manslayer
as
of
the
libertine
.
 
<EOS>
This
,
said
he
,
I
will
bear
;
for
I
have
no
reason
to
be
ashamed
of
that
duel
,
nor
the
cause
of
it
;
since
it
was
to
save
a
friend
,
and
because
it
is
levelled
at
myself
only
:
but
suffer
not
your
tongue
to
take
too
great
a
liberty
with
my
Pamela
.
  
<EOS>
She
interrupted
him
in
a
violent
burst
of
passion
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
bear
this
,
said
she
,
I
can
bear
any
thing
!
 
<EOS>
O
the
little
strumpet
!
 
<EOS>
He
interrupted
her
then
,
and
said
wrathfully
,
Begone
,
rageful
woman
!
<EOS>
begone
this
moment
from
my
presence
!
 
<EOS>
Leave
my
house
this
instant
!
 
<EOS>
I
renounce
you
,
and
all
relation
to
you
!
<EOS>
and
never
more
let
me
see
your
face
,
or
call
me
brother
!
<EOS>
And
took
her
by
the
hand
to
lead
her
out
.
 
<EOS>
She
laid
hold
of
the
curtains
of
the
window
,
and
said
,
I
will
not
go
!
 
<EOS>
You
shall
not
force
me
from
you
thus
ignominiously
in
the
wretch
's
hearing
,
and
suffer
her
to
triumph
over
me
in
your
barbarous
treatment
of
me
.
  
<EOS>
Not
considering
any
thing
,
I
ran
out
of
the
closet
,
and
threw
myself
at
my
dear
master
's
feet
,
as
he
held
her
hand
,
in
order
to
lead
her
out
;
and
I
said
,
Dearest
sir
,
let
me
beg
,
that
no
act
of
unkindness
,
for
my
sake
,
pass
between
so
worthy
and
so
near
relations
.
 
<EOS>
Dear
,
dear
madam
,
said
I
,
and
clasped
her
knees
,
pardon
and
excuse
the
unhappy
cause
of
all
this
evil
;
on
my
knees
I
beg
your
ladyship
to
receive
me
to
your
grace
and
favour
,
and
you
shall
find
me
incapable
of
any
triumph
but
<EOS>
in
your
ladyship
's
goodness
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
Creature
,
said
she
,
art
thou
to
beg
an
excuse
for
me
?
 
<EOS>
Art
thou
to
implore
my
forgiveness
?
 
<EOS>
Is
it
to
thee
<EOS>
I
am
to
owe
the
favour
,
that
I
am
not
cast
headlong
from
my
brother
's
presence
?
 
<EOS>
Begone
to
thy
corner
,
wench
!
<EOS>
begone
,
I
say
,
lest
thy
paramour
kill
me
for
trampling
thee
under
my
foot
!
  
<EOS>
Rise
,
my
dear
Pamela
,
said
my
master
;
rise
,
dear
life
of
my
life
;
and
expose
not
so
much
worthiness
to
the
ungrateful
scorn
of
so
violent
a
spirit
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
he
led
me
to
my
closet
again
,
and
there
I
sat
and
wept
.
  
<EOS>
Her
woman
came
up
,
just
as
he
had
led
me
to
my
closet
,
and
was
returning
to
her
lady
;
and
she
very
humbly
said
,
Excuse
my
intrusion
,
good
sir
!
 
<EOS>
I
hope
I
may
come
to
my
lady
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
Mrs.
Worden
,
said
he
,
you
may
come
in
;
and
pray
take
your
lady
down
stairs
with
you
,
for
fear
I
should
too
much
forget
what
belongs
either
to
my
sister
or
myself
!
  
<EOS>
I
began
to
think
(
seeing
her
ladyship
so
outrageous
with
her
brother
)
<EOS>
what
a
happy
escape
I
had
had
the
day
before
,
though
hardly
enough
used
in
conscience
too
,
as
I
thought
.
  
<EOS>
Her
woman
begged
her
ladyship
to
walk
down
;
and
she
said
,
Beck
,
seest
thou
that
bed
?
 
<EOS>
That
was
the
bed
that
I
was
born
in
;
and
yet
that
was
the
bed
thou
sawest
,
as
well
as
I
,
the
wicked
Pamela
in
,
this
morning
,
and
this
brother
of
mine
just
risen
from
her
!
  
<EOS>
True
,
said
he
;
you
both
saw
it
,
and
it
is
my
pride
that
you
could
see
it
.
'
<EOS>
Tis
my
bridal
bed
;
and
'
tis
abominable
that
the
happiness
I
knew
before
you
came
hither
,
should
be
so
barbarously
interrupted
.
  
<EOS>
Swear
to
me
<EOS>
but
,
thou
bold
wretch
!
<EOS>
said
she
,
swear
to
me
,
that
Pamela
Andrews
is
really
and
truly
thy
lawful
wife
,
without
sham
,
without
deceit
,
without
double
-
meaning
;
and
I
know
what
I
have
to
say
!
  
<EOS>
I
'll
humour
you
for
once
,
said
he
;
and
then
swore
a
solemn
oath
that
I
was
.
 
<EOS>
And
,
said
he
,
did
I
not
tell
you
so
at
first
?
  
<EOS>
I
can
not
yet
believe
you
,
said
she
;
because
,
in
this
particular
,
I
had
rather
have
called
you
knave
than
fool
.
 
<EOS>
Provoke
me
not
too
much
,
said
he
;
for
,
if
I
should
as
much
forget
myself
as
you
have
done
<EOS>
,
you
'd
have
no
more
of
a
brother
in
me
,
than
I
have
a
sister
in
you
.
  
<EOS>
Who
married
you
?
<EOS>
said
she
:
tell
me
that
!
 
<EOS>
Was
it
not
a
broken
attorney
in
a
parson
's
habit
?
 
<EOS>
Tell
me
truly
,
in
the
wench
's
hearing
.
 
<EOS>
When
she
's
undeceived
,
she
'll
know
how
to
behave
herself
better
!
 
<EOS>
Thank
God
,
thought
I
,
it
is
not
so
.
  
<EOS>
No
,
said
he
;
and
I
'll
tell
you
,
that
I
bless
God
<EOS>
,
I
abhorred
that
project
,
before
it
was
brought
to
bear
:
and
Mr.
Williams
married
us
.
 
<EOS>
Nay
then
,
said
she
 
<EOS>
but
answer
me
another
question
or
two
,
I
beseech
you
:
<EOS>
Who
gave
her
away
?
 
<EOS>
Parson
Peters
,
said
he
.
 
<EOS>
Where
was
the
ceremony
performed
?
 
<EOS>
In
my
little
chapel
,
which
you
may
see
,
as
it
was
put
in
order
on
purpose
.
  
<EOS>
Now
,
said
she
,
I
begin
to
fear
there
is
something
in
it
!
 
<EOS>
But
who
was
present
?
<EOS>
said
she
.
 
<EOS>
Methinks
,
replied
he
,
I
look
like
a
fine
puppy
,
to
suffer
myself
to
be
thus
interrogated
by
an
insolent
sister
:
<EOS>
but
,
if
you
must
know
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
was
present
.
 
<EOS>
O
the
procuress
!
<EOS>
said
she
:
<EOS>
But
nobody
else
?
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
said
he
,
all
my
heart
and
soul
!
  
<EOS>
Wretch
!
said
she
;
and
what
would
thy
father
and
mother
have
said
,
had
they
lived
to
this
day
?
 
<EOS>
Their
consents
,
replied
he
<EOS>
,
I
should
have
thought
it
my
duty
to
ask
;
but
not
yours
,
madam
.
  
<EOS>
Suppose
,
said
she
,
I
had
married
my
father
's
groom
!
<EOS>
what
would
you
have
said
to
that
?
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
have
behaved
worse
,
replied
he
,
than
you
have
done
.
 
<EOS>
And
would
you
not
have
thought
,
said
she
,
I
had
deserved
it
.
  
<EOS>
Said
he
<EOS>
,
Does
your
pride
let
you
see
no
difference
in
the
case
you
put
?
<EOS>
None
at
all
,
said
she
.
 
<EOS>
Where
can
the
difference
be
between
a
beggar
's
son
married
by
a
lady
,
or
a
beggar
's
daughter
<EOS>
made
a
gentleman
's
wife
?
  
<EOS>
Then
I
'll
tell
you
,
replied
he
;
<EOS>
the
difference
is
,
a
man
ennobles
the
woman
he
takes
,
be
she
who
she
will
;
and
adopts
her
into
his
own
rank
,
be
it
<EOS>
what
it
will
:
but
a
woman
,
though
ever
so
nobly
born
,
debases
herself
by
a
mean
marriage
,
and
descends
from
her
own
rank
to
his
<EOS>
she
stoops
to
.
  
<EOS>
When
the
royal
family
of
Stuart
allied
itself
into
the
low
family
of
Hyde
,
(
comparatively
low
,
I
mean
,
)
did
any
body
scruple
to
call
the
lady
,
Royal
Highness
,
and
Duchess
of
York
?
 
<EOS>
And
did
any
body
think
her
daughters
,
the
late
Queen
Mary
and
Queen
Anne
,
less
royal
for
that
?
  
<EOS>
When
the
broken
-
fortuned
peer
goes
into
the
city
to
marry
a
rich
tradesman
's
daughter
,
be
he
duke
or
earl
,
does
not
his
consort
immediately
become
ennobled
by
his
choice
?
<EOS>
and
who
scruples
to
call
her
lady
,
duchess
,
or
countess
?
  
<EOS>
But
when
a
duchess
or
countess
dowager
descends
to
mingle
with
a
person
of
obscure
birth
,
does
she
not
then
degrade
herself
?
<EOS>
and
is
she
not
effectually
degraded
?
 
<EOS>
And
will
any
duchess
or
countess
rank
with
her
?
  
<EOS>
Now
,
Lady
Davers
,
do
you
not
see
a
difference
between
my
marrying
my
dear
mother
's
beloved
and
deserving
waiting
-
maid
,
with
a
million
of
excellencies
about
her
,
and
such
graces
of
mind
and
person
as
would
adorn
any
distinction
;
and
your
marrying
a
sordid
groom
,
whose
constant
train
of
education
,
conversation
,
and
opportunities
,
could
possibly
give
him
no
other
merit
,
than
that
which
must
proceed
from
the
vilest
,
lowest
taste
,
in
his
sordid
dignifier
?
  
<EOS>
O
the
wretch
!
<EOS>
said
she
,
how
he
finds
excuses
to
palliate
his
meanness
!
  
<EOS>
Again
,
said
he
,
let
me
observe
to
you
,
Lady
Davers
,
When
a
duke
marries
a
private
person
,
is
he
not
still
her
head
,
by
virtue
of
being
her
husband
?
<EOS>
But
,
when
a
lady
descends
to
marry
a
groom
,
is
not
the
groom
her
head
,
being
her
husband
?
 
<EOS>
And
does
not
the
difference
strike
you
?
 
<EOS>
For
what
lady
of
quality
ought
to
respect
another
,
who
has
made
so
sordid
a
choice
,
and
set
a
groom
above
her
?
 
<EOS>
For
,
would
not
that
be
to
put
that
groom
upon
a
par
with
themselves
?
 
<EOS>
Call
this
palliation
,
or
what
you
will
;
but
if
you
see
not
the
difference
,
you
are
blind
;
and
a
very
unfit
judge
for
yourself
,
much
more
unfit
to
be
a
censurer
of
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
'd
have
you
,
said
she
,
publish
your
fine
reasons
to
the
world
,
and
they
will
be
sweet
encouragements
to
all
the
young
gentlemen
who
read
them
to
cast
themselves
away
on
the
servant
-
wenches
in
their
families
.
  
<EOS>
Not
at
all
,
Lady
Davers
,
replied
he
:
<EOS>
For
,
if
any
young
gentleman
stays
till
he
finds
such
a
person
as
my
Pamela
,
so
enriched
with
the
beauties
of
person
and
mind
,
so
well
accomplished
,
and
so
fitted
to
adorn
the
degree
she
is
raised
to
,
he
will
stand
as
easily
acquitted
,
as
I
shall
be
to
all
the
world
that
sees
her
,
except
there
be
many
more
Lady
Davers
than
I
apprehend
can
possibly
be
met
with
.
  
<EOS>
And
so
,
returned
she
,
you
say
you
are
actually
and
really
married
,
honestly
,
or
rather
<EOS>
foolishly
married
,
to
this
slut
?
  
<EOS>
I
am
,
indeed
,
says
he
,
if
you
presume
to
call
her
so
!
 
<EOS>
And
why
should
I
not
,
if
I
please
?
 
<EOS>
Who
is
there
ought
to
contradict
me
?
 
<EOS>
Whom
have
I
hurt
by
it
?
 
<EOS>
Have
I
not
an
estate
,
free
and
independent
?
 
<EOS>
Am
I
likely
to
be
beholden
to
you
,
or
any
of
my
relations
?
 
<EOS>
And
why
,
when
I
have
a
sufficiency
in
my
own
single
hands
,
should
I
scruple
to
make
a
woman
equally
happy
,
who
has
all
I
want
?
 
<EOS>
For
beauty
,
virtue
,
prudence
,
and
generosity
too
,
I
will
tell
you
,
she
has
more
than
any
lady
I
ever
saw
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
Lady
Davers
,
she
has
all
these
naturally
;
they
are
born
with
her
;
and
a
few
years
'
education
,
with
her
genius
,
has
done
more
for
her
,
than
a
whole
life
has
done
for
others
.
  
<EOS>
No
more
,
no
more
,
I
beseech
you
,
said
she
;
thou
surfeitest
me
,
honest
man
!
<EOS>
with
thy
weak
folly
.
 
<EOS>
Thou
art
worse
than
an
idolater
<EOS>
;
thou
hast
made
a
graven
image
,
and
thou
fallest
down
and
worshippest
the
works
of
thy
own
hands
;
and
,
Jeroboam
-
like
,
wouldst
have
every
body
else
bow
down
before
thy
calf
!
  
<EOS>
Well
said
,
Lady
Davers
!
 
<EOS>
Whenever
your
passion
suffers
you
to
descend
to
witticism
;
'
tis
almost
over
with
you
.
 
<EOS>
But
let
me
tell
you
,
though
I
myself
worship
this
sweet
creature
,
that
you
call
such
names
,
I
want
nobody
else
to
do
it
;
and
should
be
glad
you
had
not
intruded
upon
me
,
to
interrupt
me
in
the
course
of
our
mutual
happiness
.
  
<EOS>
Well
said
,
well
said
,
my
kind
,
my
well
-
mannered
brother
!
<EOS>
said
she
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
,
after
this
,
very
little
interrupt
your
mutual
happiness
<EOS>
,
I
'll
assure
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
thought
you
a
gentleman
once
,
and
prided
myself
in
my
brother
:
<EOS>
But
I
'll
say
now
with
the
burial
service
,
Ashes
to
ashes
,
and
dirt
to
dirt
!
  
<EOS>
Ay
,
said
he
,
Lady
Davers
,
and
there
we
must
all
end
at
last
;
you
with
all
your
pride
,
and
I
with
my
plentiful
fortune
,
must
come
to
it
;
and
then
where
will
be
your
distinction
?
 
<EOS>
Let
me
tell
you
,
except
you
and
I
both
mend
our
manners
,
though
you
have
been
no
duellist
,
no
libertine
,
as
you
call
me
,
this
amiable
girl
,
whom
your
vanity
and
folly
so
much
despise
,
will
out
-
soar
us
both
,
infinitely
out
-
soar
us
;
and
he
who
judges
best
,
will
give
the
preference
where
due
,
without
regard
to
birth
or
fortune
.
  
<EOS>
Egregious
preacher
!
<EOS>
said
she
:
<EOS>
What
,
my
brother
already
turned
Puritan
!
  
<EOS>
See
what
marriage
and
repentance
may
bring
a
man
to
!
 
<EOS>
I
heartily
congratulate
this
change
!
 
<EOS>
Well
,
said
she
,
(
and
came
towards
me
,
and
I
trembled
to
see
her
coming
;
but
her
brother
followed
to
observe
her
,
and
I
stood
up
at
her
approach
,
and
she
said
,
)
give
me
thy
hand
,
Mrs.
Pamela
,
Mrs.
Andrews
,
Mrs.
what
shall
I
call
thee
?
 
<EOS>
Thou
hast
done
wonders
in
a
little
time
;
thou
hast
not
only
made
a
rake
<EOS>
a
husband
but
thou
hast
made
a
rake
a
preacher
!
 
<EOS>
But
take
care
,
added
she
,
after
all
,
in
ironical
anger
,
and
tapped
me
on
the
neck
,
take
care
that
thy
vanity
begins
not
where
his
ends
;
and
that
thou
callest
not
thyself
my
sister
.
  
<EOS>
She
shall
,
I
hope
,
Lady
Davers
,
said
he
,
when
she
can
make
as
great
a
convert
of
you
from
pride
,
as
she
has
of
me
,
from
libertinism
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
just
then
came
up
,
and
said
dinner
was
ready
.
 
<EOS>
Come
,
my
Pamela
,
said
my
dear
master
;
you
desired
to
be
excused
from
breakfasting
with
us
;
but
I
hope
you
'll
give
Lady
Davers
and
me
your
company
to
dinner
.
  
<EOS>
How
dare
you
insult
me
thus
?
<EOS>
said
my
lady
.
 
<EOS>
How
dare
you
,
said
he
,
insult
me
by
your
conduct
in
my
own
house
,
after
I
have
told
you
I
am
married
?
<EOS>
How
dare
you
think
of
staying
here
one
moment
,
and
refuse
my
wife
the
honours
that
belong
to
her
as
such
?
  
<EOS>
Merciful
God
!
<EOS>
said
she
,
give
me
patience
!
<EOS>
and
held
her
hand
to
her
forehead
.
  
<EOS>
Pray
,
sir
,
dear
sir
,
said
I
,
excuse
me
,
do
n't
vex
my
lady
:
 
<EOS>
Be
silent
,
my
dear
love
,
said
he
<EOS>
;
you
see
already
what
you
have
got
by
your
sweet
condescension
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
thrown
yourself
at
her
feet
,
and
,
insolent
as
she
is
,
she
has
threatened
to
trample
upon
you
.
 
<EOS>
She
'll
ask
you
,
presently
,
if
she
is
to
owe
her
excuse
to
your
interposition
?
<EOS>
and
yet
nothing
else
can
make
her
forgiven
.
  
<EOS>
Poor
lady
,
she
could
not
bear
this
;
and
,
as
if
she
was
discomposed
,
she
ran
to
her
poor
grieved
woman
,
and
took
hold
of
her
hand
,
and
said
,
Lead
me
down
,
lead
me
down
,
Beck
!
 
<EOS>
Let
us
instantly
quit
this
house
,
this
cursed
house
,
that
once
I
took
pleasure
in
!
 
<EOS>
Order
the
fellows
to
get
ready
,
and
I
will
never
see
it
,
nor
its
owner
,
more
.
 
<EOS>
And
away
she
went
down
stairs
,
in
a
great
hurry
.
 
<EOS>
And
the
servants
were
ordered
to
make
ready
for
their
departure
.
  
<EOS>
I
saw
my
master
was
troubled
,
and
I
went
to
him
,
and
said
,
Pray
,
dear
sir
,
follow
my
lady
down
,
and
pacify
her
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
her
love
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
woman
!
<EOS>
said
he
,
I
am
concerned
for
her
!
 
<EOS>
But
I
insist
upon
your
coming
down
,
since
things
are
gone
so
far
.
 
<EOS>
Her
pride
will
get
new
strength
else
,
and
we
shall
be
all
to
begin
again
.
  
<EOS>
Dearest
,
dear
sir
,
said
I
,
excuse
my
going
down
this
once
!
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
my
dear
,
I
wo
n't
,
replied
he
.
 
<EOS>
What
!
<EOS>
shall
it
be
said
,
that
my
sister
shall
scare
my
wife
from
my
table
,
and
I
present
?
 
<EOS>
No
,
I
have
borne
too
much
already
;
and
so
have
you
:
<EOS>
And
I
charge
you
come
down
when
I
send
for
you
.
  
<EOS>
He
departed
,
saying
these
words
,
and
I
durst
not
dispute
;
for
I
saw
he
was
determined
.
 
<EOS>
And
there
is
as
much
majesty
as
goodness
in
him
,
as
I
have
often
had
reason
to
observe
;
though
never
more
than
on
the
present
occasion
with
his
sister
.
 
<EOS>
Her
ladyship
instantly
put
on
her
hood
and
gloves
,
and
her
woman
tied
up
a
handkerchief
full
of
things
;
for
her
principal
matters
were
not
unpacked
;
and
her
coachman
got
her
chariot
ready
,
and
her
footmen
their
horses
;
and
she
appeared
resolved
to
go
.
<EOS>
But
her
kinsman
and
Mr.
Colbrand
had
taken
a
turn
together
,
somewhere
;
and
she
would
not
come
in
,
but
sat
fretting
on
a
seat
in
the
fore
-
yard
,
with
her
woman
by
her
;
and
,
at
last
,
said
to
one
of
the
footmen
,
<EOS>
Do
you
,
James
,
stay
to
attend
my
nephew
;
and
we
'll
take
the
road
we
came
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
went
to
her
ladyship
,
and
said
,
Your
ladyship
will
be
pleased
to
stay
dinner
;
'
tis
just
coming
upon
table
?
 
<EOS>
No
,
said
she
,
I
have
enough
of
this
house
;
I
have
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
But
give
my
service
to
your
master
,
and
I
wish
him
happier
than
he
has
made
me
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
sent
for
me
down
,
and
I
came
,
though
unwillingly
,
and
the
cloth
was
laid
in
the
parlour
I
had
jumped
out
of
;
and
there
was
my
master
walking
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
came
in
,
and
asked
,
if
he
pleased
to
have
dinner
brought
in
?
<EOS>
for
my
lady
would
not
come
in
,
but
desired
her
service
,
and
wished
him
happier
than
he
had
made
her
.
 
<EOS>
He
,
seeing
her
at
the
window
,
when
he
went
to
that
side
of
the
room
,
all
ready
to
go
,
stept
out
to
her
,
and
said
,
Lady
Davers
,
if
I
thought
you
would
not
be
hardened
,
rather
than
softened
,
by
my
civility
,
I
would
ask
you
to
walk
in
;
and
,
at
least
,
let
your
kinsman
and
servants
dine
before
they
go
.
<EOS>
She
wept
,
and
turned
her
face
from
him
,
to
hide
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
took
her
hand
,
and
said
,
Come
,
sister
,
let
me
prevail
upon
you
:
Walk
in
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
said
she
,
do
n't
ask
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
I
could
hate
you
,
as
much
as
you
hate
me
!
 
<EOS>
You
do
,
said
he
,
and
<EOS>
a
great
deal
more
,
I
'll
assure
you
;
or
else
you
'd
not
vex
me
as
you
do
.
 
<EOS>
Come
,
pray
walk
in
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
ask
me
,
said
she
.
 
<EOS>
Her
kinsman
just
then
returned
:
Why
,
madam
,
said
he
,
your
ladyship
wo
n't
go
till
you
have
dined
,
I
hope
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
Jackey
,
said
she
,
I
ca
n't
stay
;
I
'm
an
intruder
here
,
it
seems
!
 
<EOS>
Think
,
said
my
master
,
of
the
occasion
you
gave
for
that
word
.
 
<EOS>
Your
violent
passions
are
the
only
intruders
!
 
<EOS>
Lay
them
aside
,
and
never
sister
was
dearer
to
a
brother
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
say
such
another
word
,
said
she
,
I
beseech
you
;
for
I
am
too
easy
to
forgive
you
any
thing
for
one
kind
word
!
 
<EOS>
You
shall
have
one
hundred
,
said
he
,
nay
,
ten
thousand
,
if
they
will
do
,
my
dear
sister
.
 
<EOS>
And
,
kissing
her
,
he
added
,
Pray
give
me
your
hand
.
 
<EOS>
John
,
said
he
,
put
up
the
horses
;
you
are
all
as
welcome
to
me
,
for
all
your
lady
's
angry
with
me
,
as
at
any
inn
you
can
put
up
at
.
<EOS>
Come
,
Mr.
H
#
#
#
#
,
said
he
,
lead
your
aunt
in
;
for
she
wo
n't
permit
that
honour
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
This
quite
overcame
her
;
and
she
said
,
giving
her
brother
her
hand
,
Yes
,
I
will
,
and
you
shall
lead
me
any
where
!
<EOS>
and
kissed
him
.
 
<EOS>
But
do
n't
think
,
said
she
,
I
can
forgive
you
neither
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
he
led
her
into
the
parlour
where
I
was
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
said
she
,
why
do
you
lead
me
to
this
wench
?
'
<EOS>
Tis
<EOS>
my
wife
,
my
dear
sister
;
and
if
you
will
not
love
her
,
yet
do
n't
forget
common
civilities
to
her
,
for
your
own
sake
.
  
<EOS>
Pray
,
madam
,
said
her
kinsman
,
since
your
brother
is
pleased
to
own
his
marriage
,
we
must
not
forget
common
civilities
,
as
Mr.
B
#
#
#
#
says
.
 
<EOS>
And
,
sir
,
added
he
,
permit
me
to
wish
you
joy
.
 
<EOS>
Thank
you
,
sir
,
said
he
.
 
<EOS>
And
may
I
?
<EOS>
said
he
,
looking
at
me
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
sir
,
replied
my
master
.
 
<EOS>
So
he
saluted
me
,
very
complaisantly
;
and
said
,
I
vow
to
Gad
,
madam
,
I
did
not
know
this
yesterday
;
<EOS>
and
if
I
was
guilty
of
a
fault
,
I
beg
your
pardon
.
  
<EOS>
My
lady
said
,
Thou'rt
a
good
-
natured
foolish
fellow
;
thou
might'st
have
saved
this
nonsensical
parade
,
till
I
had
given
thee
leave
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
aunt
,
said
he
,
if
they
are
actually
married
,
there
's
no
help
for
it
;
and
we
must
not
make
mischief
between
man
and
wife
.
  
<EOS>
But
brother
,
said
she
<EOS>
,
do
you
think
I
'll
sit
at
table
with
the
creature
?
<EOS>
No
contemptuous
names
,
I
beseech
you
,
Lady
Davers
!
 
<EOS>
I
tell
you
she
is
really
my
wife
;
and
I
must
be
a
villain
to
suffer
her
to
be
ill
used
.
<EOS>
She
has
no
protector
but
me
;
and
,
if
you
will
permit
her
,
she
will
always
love
and
honour
you
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
indeed
I
will
,
madam
,
said
I.
  
I
can
not
,
I
wo
n't
sit
down
at
table
with
her
,
said
she
:
<EOS>
Pamela
,
I
hope
thou
dost
not
think
I
will
?
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
madam
,
said
I
,
if
your
good
brother
will
permit
it
,
I
will
attend
your
chair
all
the
time
you
dine
,
to
shew
my
veneration
for
your
ladyship
,
as
the
sister
of
my
kind
protector
.
<EOS>
See
,
said
he
,
her
condition
has
not
altered
her
;
but
I
can
not
permit
in
her
a
conduct
unworthy
of
my
wife
;
and
I
hope
my
sister
will
not
expect
it
neither
.
  
<EOS>
Let
her
leave
the
room
,
replied
she
,
if
I
must
stay
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
you
are
out
of
the
way
,
aunt
,
said
her
kinsman
;
that
is
not
right
,
as
things
stand
.
<EOS>
Said
my
master
,
No
,
madam
,
that
must
not
be
;
but
,
if
it
must
be
so
,
we
'll
have
two
tables
;
you
and
your
nephew
shall
sit
at
one
,
and
my
wife
and
I
at
the
other
:
and
then
see
what
a
figure
<EOS>
your
unreasonable
punctilio
will
make
you
cut
.
 
<EOS>
She
seemed
irresolute
,
and
he
placed
her
at
the
table
;
the
first
course
,
which
was
fish
,
being
brought
in
.
 
<EOS>
Where
,
said
she
to
me
,
would'st
thou
presume
to
sit
?
 
<EOS>
Would'st
have
me
give
place
to
thee
too
,
<EOS>
wench
?
 
<EOS>
Come
,
come
,
said
my
master
,
I
'll
put
that
out
of
dispute
;
and
so
set
himself
down
by
her
ladyship
,
at
the
upper
end
of
the
table
,
and
placed
me
at
his
left
hand
.
 
<EOS>
Excuse
me
,
my
dear
,
said
he
<EOS>
;
this
once
excuse
me
!
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
your
cursed
complaisance
,
said
she
,
to
such
a
 
.
 
<EOS>
Hush
,
sister
!
<EOS>
hush
!
<EOS>
said
he
:
I
will
not
bear
to
hear
her
spoken
slightly
of
!
'
<EOS>
Tis
enough
,
that
,
to
oblige
your
violent
and
indecent
caprice
,
you
make
me
compromise
with
you
thus
.
  
<EOS>
Come
,
sir
,
added
he
,
pray
take
your
place
next
your
gentle
aunt
!
 
<EOS>
Beck
,
said
she
,
do
you
sit
down
by
Pamela
there
,
since
it
must
be
so
;
we
'll
be
hail
fellow
all
!
 
<EOS>
With
all
my
heart
,
replied
my
master
;
I
have
so
much
honour
for
all
the
sex
,
that
I
would
not
have
the
meanest
person
of
it
stand
,
while
I
sit
,
had
I
been
to
have
made
the
custom
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Worden
,
pray
sit
down
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
said
she
,
I
hope
I
shall
know
my
place
better
.
  
<EOS>
My
lady
sat
considering
;
and
then
,
lifting
up
her
hands
,
said
,
Lord
!
<EOS>
what
will
this
world
come
to
?
 
<EOS>
To
nothing
<EOS>
but
what
's
very
good
,
replied
my
master
,
if
such
spirits
as
Lady
Davers
's
do
but
take
the
rule
of
it
.
<EOS>
Shall
I
help
you
,
sister
,
to
some
of
the
carp
?
 
<EOS>
Help
your
beloved
!
<EOS>
said
she
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
kind
!
<EOS>
said
he
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
that
's
my
good
Lady
Davers
!
 
<EOS>
Here
,
my
love
,
let
me
help
you
,
since
my
sister
desires
it
.
 
<EOS>
Mighty
well
,
returned
she
,
mighty
well
!
 
But
sat
on
one
side
,
turning
from
me
,
as
it
were
.
  
<EOS>
Dear
aunt
,
said
her
kinsman
,
let
's
see
you
buss
and
be
friends
:
since
'
tis
so
,
what
signifies
it
?
 
<EOS>
Hold
thy
fool
's
tongue
!
<EOS>
said
she
:
Is
thy
tone
so
soon
turned
since
yesterday
?
<EOS>
said
my
master
,
I
hope
nothing
affronting
was
offered
yesterday
to
my
wife
,
in
her
own
house
.
 
<EOS>
She
hit
him
a
good
smart
slap
on
the
shoulder
:
<EOS>
Take
that
,
impudent
brother
said
she
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
wife
you
,
and
in
her
own
house
!
 
<EOS>
She
seemed
half
afraid
:
but
he
,
in
very
good
humour
,
kissed
her
,
and
said
,
I
thank
you
,
sister
,
I
thank
you
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
have
not
had
a
blow
from
you
before
for
some
time
!
  
<EOS>
"
Fore
gad
,
said
her
kinsman
,
'
tis
very
kind
of
you
to
take
it
so
well
.
<EOS>
Her
ladyship
is
as
good
a
woman
as
ever
lived
;
but
I
've
had
many
a
cuff
from
her
myself
.
  
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
put
it
up
neither
,
said
my
master
,
except
you
'll
assure
me
you
have
seen
her
serve
her
lord
so
.
  
<EOS>
I
pressed
my
foot
to
his
,
and
said
,
softly
,
<EOS>
Do
n't
,
dear
sir
!
 
<EOS>
What
!
<EOS>
said
she
,
is
the
creature
begging
me
off
from
insult
?
 
<EOS>
If
his
manners
wo
n't
keep
him
from
outraging
me
,
I
wo
n't
owe
his
forebearance
to
thee
,
wench
.
  
<EOS>
Said
my
master
,
and
put
some
fish
on
my
lady
's
plate
,
Well
does
Lady
Davers
use
the
word
insult
!
 
<EOS>
But
,
come
,
let
me
see
you
eat
one
mouthful
,
and
I
'll
forgive
you
;
and
he
put
the
knife
in
one
of
her
hands
,
and
the
fork
in
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
As
I
hope
to
live
,
said
he
,
I
can
not
bear
this
silly
childishness
,
for
nothing
at
all
!
 
<EOS>
I
am
quite
ashamed
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
She
put
a
little
bit
to
her
mouth
,
but
laid
it
down
in
her
plate
again
:
<EOS>
I
can
not
eat
,
said
she
;
<EOS>
I
can
not
swallow
,
I
'm
sure
.
 
<EOS>
It
will
certainly
choak
me
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
forbid
his
menservants
to
come
in
,
that
they
might
not
behold
the
scene
he
expected
;
and
rose
from
table
himself
,
and
filled
a
glass
of
wine
,
her
woman
offering
,
and
her
kinsman
rising
,
to
do
it
.
<EOS>
Mean
-
time
,
his
seat
between
us
being
vacant
<EOS>
,
she
turned
to
me
:
How
now
,
confidence
,
said
she
,
darest
thou
sit
next
me
?
 
<EOS>
Why
dost
thou
not
rise
,
and
take
the
glass
from
thy
property
?
  
<EOS>
Sit
still
,
my
dear
,
said
he
;
I
'll
help
you
both
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
arose
;
<EOS>
for
I
was
afraid
of
a
good
cuff
;
and
said
,
Pray
,
sir
,
let
me
help
my
lady
.
 
<EOS>
So
you
shall
,
replied
he
,
when
she
's
in
a
humour
to
receive
it
as
she
ought
.
<EOS>
Sister
,
said
he
,
with
a
glass
in
his
hand
,
pray
drink
;
you
'll
perhaps
eat
a
little
bit
of
something
then
.
 
<EOS>
Is
this
to
insult
me
?
<EOS>
said
she
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
really
,
returned
he
:
but
to
incite
you
to
eat
;
for
you
'll
be
sick
for
want
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
She
took
the
glass
,
and
said
,
God
forgive
you
,
wicked
wretch
,
for
your
usage
of
me
this
day
!
 
<EOS>
This
is
a
little
as
it
used
to
be
!
 
<EOS>
I
once
had
your
love
;
 
and
now
it
is
changed
;
and
for
whom
?
<EOS>
that
vexes
me
!
 
<EOS>
And
wept
<EOS>
so
,
she
was
forced
to
set
down
the
glass
.
  
<EOS>
You
do
n't
do
well
,
said
he
.
 
<EOS>
You
neither
treat
me
like
your
brother
nor
a
gentleman
;
and
if
you
would
suffer
me
,
I
would
love
you
as
well
as
ever
.
  
<EOS>
B
ut
for
a
woman
of
sense
and
understanding
,
and
a
fine
-
bred
woman
,
<EOS>
as
I
once
thought
my
sister
,
you
act
quite
a
childish
part
.
 
<EOS>
Come
,
added
he
,
and
held
the
glass
to
her
lips
,
let
your
brother
,
that
you
once
loved
,
prevail
on
you
to
drink
this
glass
of
wine
.
 
<EOS>
She
then
drank
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
kissed
her
,
and
said
,
Oh
!
<EOS>
how
passion
deforms
the
noblest
minds
!
 
<EOS>
You
have
lost
a
good
deal
of
that
loveliness
that
used
to
adorn
my
sister
.
<EOS>
And
let
me
persuade
you
to
compose
yourself
,
and
be
my
sister
again
!
 
<EOS>
For
Lady
Davers
is
,
indeed
,
a
fine
woman
;
and
has
a
presence
as
majestic
for
a
lady
,
as
her
dear
brother
has
for
a
gentleman
.
  
<EOS>
He
then
sat
down
between
us
again
,
and
said
,
when
the
second
course
came
in
,
Let
Abraham
come
in
and
wait
.
 
<EOS>
I
touched
his
toe
again
;
but
he
minded
it
not
;
and
I
saw
he
was
right
;
for
her
ladyship
began
to
recollect
herself
,
and
did
not
behave
half
so
ill
before
the
servants
,
as
she
had
done
;
and
helped
herself
with
some
little
freedom
;
but
she
could
not
forbear
a
strong
sigh
and
a
sob
now
and
then
.
 
<EOS>
She
called
for
a
glass
of
the
same
wine
she
had
drank
before
.
 
<EOS>
Said
he
<EOS>
,
Shall
I
help
you
again
,
Lady
Davers
?
 
and
rose
,
at
the
same
time
,
and
went
to
the
sideboard
,
and
filled
her
a
glass
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
said
she
,
I
love
to
be
soothed
by
my
brother
!
 
<EOS>
Your
health
,
sir
!
  
<EOS>
Said
my
master
to
me
,
with
great
sweetness
,
My
dear
,
now
I
'm
up
,
I
'll
fill
for
you
!
 
<EOS>
I
must
serve
both
sisters
alike
!
 
<EOS>
She
looked
at
the
servant
,
as
if
he
were
a
little
check
upon
her
,
and
said
to
my
master
,
How
now
,
sir
!
 
<EOS>
Not
that
you
know
of
.
 
<EOS>
He
whispered
her
,
Do
n't
shew
any
contempt
before
my
servants
to
one
<EOS>
I
have
so
deservedly
made
their
mistress
.
 
<EOS>
Consider
,
'
tis
done
.
 
<EOS>
Ay
,
said
she
,
that
's
the
thing
that
kills
me
.
  
<EOS>
He
gave
me
a
glass
:
<EOS>
My
good
lady
's
health
,
sir
,
said
I.
 
That
wo
n't
do
,
said
she
,
leaning
towards
me
,
softly
:
and
was
going
to
say
wench
,
or
creature
,
or
some
such
word
.
 
<EOS>
And
my
master
,
seeing
Abraham
look
towards
her
,
her
eyes
being
red
and
swelled
,
said
,
Indeed
,
<EOS>
sister
,
I
would
not
vex
myself
about
it
,
if
I
was
you
.
 
<EOS>
About
what
?
<EOS>
said
she
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
replied
he
,
about
your
lord
's
not
coming
down
,
as
he
had
promised
.
 
<EOS>
He
sat
down
,
and
she
tapped
him
on
the
shoulder
:
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
wicked
one
,
said
she
,
nor
will
that
do
neither
!
 
<EOS>
Why
,
to
be
sure
,
added
he
,
it
would
vex
a
lady
of
your
sense
and
merit
to
be
slighted
,
if
it
was
so
;
but
I
am
sure
my
lord
loves
you
,
as
well
as
you
love
him
;
and
you
know
not
what
may
have
happened
.
  
<EOS>
She
shook
her
head
,
and
said
,
That
's
like
your
art
!
 
<EOS>
This
makes
one
amazed
you
should
be
so
caught
!
 
<EOS>
Who
,
my
lord
caught
!
<EOS>
said
he
:
<EOS>
No
,
no
!
<EOS>
he
'll
have
more
wit
than
so
!
 
<EOS>
But
I
never
heard
you
were
jealous
before
.
<EOS>
Nor
,
said
he
,
have
you
any
reason
to
think
so
now
!
 
<EOS>
Honest
friend
<EOS>
,
you
need
not
wait
,
said
she
;
my
woman
will
help
us
to
what
we
want
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
let
him
,
replied
he
.
 
<EOS>
Abraham
,
fill
me
a
glass
.
 
<EOS>
Come
,
said
my
master
,
Lord
Davers
to
you
,
madam
:
<EOS>
I
hope
he
'll
take
care
<EOS>
he
is
not
found
out
!
 
<EOS>
You
're
very
provoking
,
brother
,
said
she
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
you
were
as
good
as
Lord
Davers
.
 
<EOS>
But
do
n't
carry
your
jest
too
far
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
said
he
,
'
tis
a
tender
point
,
I
own
.
 
<EOS>
I
've
done
.
  
<EOS>
By
these
kind
managements
the
dinner
passed
over
better
than
I
expected
.
<EOS>
And
when
the
servants
were
withdrawn
,
my
master
said
,
still
keeping
his
place
between
us
,
I
have
a
question
to
ask
you
,
Lady
Davers
,
and
that
is
,
If
you
'll
bear
me
company
to
Bedfordshire
?
 
<EOS>
I
was
intending
to
set
out
thither
to
-
morrow
,
but
I
'll
tarry
your
pleasure
,
if
you
'll
go
with
me
.
  
<EOS>
Is
thy
wife
,
as
thou
callest
her
,
to
go
along
with
thee
,
friend
?
<EOS>
said
she
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
to
be
sure
,
answered
he
,
my
dear
Quaker
sister
;
and
took
her
hand
,
and
smiled
.
 
<EOS>
And
would'st
have
me
parade
it
with
her
on
the
road
?
  
<EOS>
Hey
?
 
<EOS>
And
make
one
to
grace
her
retinue
?
 
<EOS>
Hey
?
 
<EOS>
Tell
me
how
thoud'st
chalk
it
out
,
if
I
would
do
as
<EOS>
thou
would'st
have
me
,
honest
friend
?
  
<EOS>
He
clasped
his
arms
about
her
,
and
kissed
her
:
<EOS>
You
are
a
dear
saucy
sister
,
said
he
;
but
I
must
love
you
!
 
<EOS>
Why
,
I
'll
tell
you
how
I
'd
have
it
.
 
<EOS>
Here
shall
you
,
and
<EOS>
my
Pamela
 
Leave
out
my
<EOS>
,
I
desire
you
,
if
you
'd
have
me
sit
patiently
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
replied
he
,
I
ca
n't
do
that
.
 
<EOS>
Here
shall
you
,
and
my
Pamela
,
go
together
in
your
chariot
,
if
you
please
;
and
she
will
then
appear
as
one
of
your
retinue
;
and
your
nephew
and
I
will
sometimes
ride
,
and
sometimes
go
into
my
chariot
,
to
your
woman
.
  
<EOS>
Should'st
thou
like
this
,
creature
?
<EOS>
said
she
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
If
your
ladyship
think
it
not
too
great
an
honour
for
me
,
madam
,
said
I.
 
Yes
,
replied
she
,
but
my
ladyship
does
think
it
would
be
too
great
an
honour
.
  
<EOS>
Now
I
think
of
it
,
said
he
,
this
must
not
be
neither
;
for
,
without
you
'd
give
her
the
hand
in
your
own
chariot
,
my
wife
would
be
thought
your
woman
,
and
that
must
not
be
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
that
would
,
may
be
,
said
she
,
be
the
only
inducement
for
me
to
bear
her
near
me
,
in
my
chariot
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
how
then
?
 
<EOS>
Why
then
,
when
we
came
home
,
we
'd
get
Lord
Davers
to
come
to
us
,
and
stay
a
month
or
two
.
  
<EOS>
And
what
if
he
was
to
come
?
 
<EOS>
Why
I
would
have
you
,
as
I
know
you
have
a
good
fancy
,
give
Pamela
your
judgment
on
some
patterns
I
expect
from
London
,
for
clothes
.
 
<EOS>
Provoking
wretch
!
<EOS>
said
she
<EOS>
;
now
I
wish
I
may
keep
my
hands
to
myself
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
say
it
to
provoke
you
,
said
he
,
nor
ought
it
to
do
so
.
 
<EOS>
But
when
I
tell
you
I
am
married
,
is
it
not
a
consequence
that
we
must
have
new
clothes
?
  
<EOS>
Hast
thou
any
more
of
these
obliging
things
to
say
to
me
,
friend
?
<EOS>
said
she
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
make
you
a
present
,
returned
he
,
worth
your
acceptance
,
if
you
will
grace
us
with
your
company
at
church
,
when
we
make
our
appearance
.
 
<EOS>
Take
<EOS>
that
,
said
she
,
if
I
die
for
it
,
wretch
that
thou
art
!
<EOS>
and
was
going
to
hit
him
a
great
slap
;
but
he
held
her
hand
.
 
<EOS>
Her
kinsman
said
,
Dear
aunt
,
I
wonder
at
you
!
 
<EOS>
Why
,
all
these
are
things
of
course
.
  
<EOS>
I
begged
leave
to
withdraw
;
and
,
as
I
went
out
,
my
good
master
said
,
There
's
a
person
!
 
<EOS>
There
's
a
shape
!
 
<EOS>
There
's
a
sweetness
!
 
<EOS>
O
,
Lady
Davers
!
<EOS>
were
you
a
man
,
you
would
doat
on
her
,
as
I
do
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
said
the
naughty
lady
,
so
I
should
,
for
my
harlot
,
but
not
for
my
wife
.
 
<EOS>
I
turned
,
on
this
,
and
said
,
Indeed
your
ladyship
is
cruel
;
and
well
may
gentlemen
take
liberties
,
when
ladies
of
honour
say
such
things
!
 
<EOS>
And
I
wept
,
and
added
,
Your
ladyship
's
inference
,
<EOS>
if
your
good
brother
was
not
the
most
generous
of
men
,
would
make
me
very
unhappy
.
  
<EOS>
No
fear
,
wench
<EOS>
;
no
fear
,
said
she
;
thou'lt
hold
him
as
long
as
any
body
can
,
I
see
that
!
 
<EOS>
Poor
Sally
Godfrey
never
had
half
the
interest
in
him
,
I
'll
assure
you
.
  
<EOS>
Stay
,
my
Pamela
,
said
he
,
in
a
passion
;
stay
,
when
I
bid
you
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
now
heard
two
vile
charges
upon
me
!
 
<EOS>
I
love
you
with
such
a
true
affection
,
that
I
ought
to
say
something
before
this
malicious
accuser
,
that
you
may
not
think
your
consummate
virtue
linked
to
<EOS>
so
black
a
villain
.
  
<EOS>
Her
nephew
seemed
uneasy
,
and
blamed
her
much
;
and
I
came
back
,
but
trembled
as
I
stood
;
and
he
set
me
down
,
and
said
,
taking
my
hand
,
I
have
been
accused
,
<EOS>
my
dear
,
as
a
dueller
,
and
now
as
a
profligate
,
in
another
sense
;
and
there
was
a
time
I
should
not
have
received
these
imputations
with
so
much
concern
as
I
now
do
,
when
I
would
wish
,
by
degrees
,
by
a
conformity
of
my
manners
to
your
virtue
,
to
shew
every
one
<EOS>
the
force
your
example
has
upon
me
.
 
<EOS>
But
this
briefly
is
the
case
of
the
first
.
  
<EOS>
I
had
a
friend
,
who
had
been
basely
attempted
to
be
assassinated
by
bravoes
,
hired
by
a
man
of
title
in
Italy
,
who
,
like
many
other
persons
of
title
,
had
no
honour
;
and
,
at
Padua
,
I
had
the
fortune
to
disarm
one
of
these
bravoes
in
my
friend
's
defence
,
and
made
him
confess
his
employer
;
and
him
,
I
own
,
I
challenged
.
 
<EOS>
At
Sienna
we
met
,
and
he
died
in
a
month
after
,
of
a
fever
;
but
,
I
hope
,
not
occasioned
by
the
slight
wounds
he
had
received
from
me
;
though
I
was
obliged
to
leave
Italy
upon
it
,
sooner
than
I
intended
,
because
of
his
numerous
relations
,
who
looked
upon
me
as
the
cause
of
his
death
;
though
I
pacified
them
by
a
letter
I
wrote
them
from
Inspruck
,
acquainting
them
with
the
baseness
of
the
deceased
:
and
they
followed
me
not
to
Munich
,
as
they
intended
.
  
<EOS>
This
is
one
of
the
good
-
natured
hints
that
might
shock
your
sweetness
,
on
reflecting
that
you
are
yoked
with
a
murderer
.
 
<EOS>
The
other
 
Nay
,
brother
,
said
she
,
say
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
<EOS>
your
own
fault
<EOS>
if
you
go
further
.
 
<EOS>
She
shall
know
it
all
,
said
he
;
and
I
defy
the
utmost
stretch
of
your
malice
.
  
<EOS>
When
I
was
at
college
,
I
was
well
received
by
a
widow
lady
,
who
had
several
daughters
,
and
but
small
fortunes
to
give
them
;
and
the
old
lady
set
one
of
them
(
a
deserving
good
girl
she
was
,
)
to
draw
me
into
marriage
with
her
,
for
the
sake
of
the
fortune
I
was
heir
to
;
and
contrived
many
opportunities
to
bring
us
and
leave
us
together
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
not
then
of
age
;
and
the
young
lady
,
not
half
so
artful
as
her
mother
,
yielded
to
my
addresses
before
the
mother
's
plot
could
be
ripened
,
and
so
utterly
disappointed
it
.
 
<EOS>
This
,
my
Pamela
,
is
the
Sally
Godfrey
,
this
malicious
woman
,
with
the
worst
intentions
,
has
informed
you
of
.
 
<EOS>
And
whatever
other
liberties
I
may
have
taken
,
(
for
perhaps
some
more
I
have
,
which
,
had
she
known
<EOS>
,
you
had
heard
of
,
as
well
as
this
,
)
<EOS>
I
desire
Heaven
will
only
forgive
me
,
till
I
revive
its
vengeance
by
the
like
offences
,
in
injury
to
my
Pamela
.
  
<EOS>
And
now
,
my
dear
,
you
may
withdraw
;
for
this
worthy
sister
of
mine
has
said
all
the
bad
she
knows
of
me
;
and
what
,
at
a
proper
opportunity
,
when
I
could
have
convinced
you
,
that
they
were
not
my
boast
,
but
my
concern
,
I
should
have
acquainted
you
with
myself
;
for
I
am
not
fond
of
being
thought
better
than
I
am
:
<EOS>
though
I
hope
,
from
the
hour
I
devoted
myself
to
so
much
virtue
,
to
that
of
my
death
,
my
conduct
shall
be
irreproachable
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
greatly
moved
at
this
,
and
the
noble
manner
in
which
the
dear
gentleman
owned
and
repented
of
his
faults
;
and
gushed
out
into
tears
,
and
said
,
No
,
do
n't
yet
go
,
Pamela
,
I
beseech
you
.
 
<EOS>
My
passion
has
carried
me
too
far
,
a
great
deal
;
and
,
coming
to
me
<EOS>
,
she
shook
my
hand
,
and
said
,
You
must
stay
to
hear
me
beg
his
pardon
;
and
so
took
his
hand
.
  
<EOS>
B
ut
,
to
my
concern
,
(
for
I
was
grieved
for
her
ladyship
's
grief
,
)
<EOS>
he
burst
from
her
;
and
went
out
of
the
parlour
into
the
garden
in
a
violent
rage
,
that
made
me
tremble
.
 
<EOS>
Her
ladyship
sat
down
,
and
leaned
her
head
against
my
bosom
,
and
made
my
neck
wet
with
her
tears
,
holding
me
by
the
hands
;
and
I
wept
for
company
.
 
<EOS>
Her
kinsman
walked
up
and
down
the
parlour
in
a
sad
fret
;
and
going
out
afterwards
,
he
came
in
,
and
said
,
Mr.
B
#
#
#
#
has
ordered
his
chariot
to
be
got
ready
,
and
wo
n't
be
spoken
to
by
any
body
.
 
<EOS>
Where
is
he
?
<EOS>
said
she
.
 
<EOS>
Walking
in
the
garden
till
it
is
ready
,
replied
he
.
  
<EOS>
Well
,
said
she
,
I
have
indeed
gone
too
far
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
bewitched
!
 
<EOS>
And
now
,
said
she
,
malicious
as
he
calls
me
,
will
he
not
forgive
me
for
a
twelvemonth
:
for
I
tell
you
,
Pamela
,
if
ever
you
offend
,
he
will
not
easily
forgive
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
all
delighted
,
though
sad
,
to
see
her
ladyship
so
good
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
Will
you
venture
,
said
she
,
to
accompany
me
to
him
?
 
<EOS>
Dare
<EOS>
you
follow
a
lion
in
his
retreats
?
 
<EOS>
I
'll
attend
your
ladyship
,
said
I
,
wherever
you
command
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
wench
,
said
she
;
<EOS>
Pamela
,
I
mean
;
thou
art
very
good
in
the
main
!
 
<EOS>
I
should
have
loved
thee
as
well
as
my
mother
<EOS>
did
 
<EOS>
if
 
but
'
tis
all
over
now
!
 
<EOS>
Indeed
you
should
not
have
married
my
brother
!
 
<EOS>
But
come
,
I
must
love
him
!
 
<EOS>
Let
's
find
him
out
!
 
<EOS>
And
yet
will
he
use
me
worse
than
a
dog
!
 
<EOS>
I
should
not
,
added
she
<EOS>
,
have
so
much
exasperated
him
:
for
,
whenever
I
have
,
I
have
always
had
the
worst
of
it
.
<EOS>
He
knows
I
love
him
!
  
<EOS>
In
this
manner
her
ladyship
talked
to
me
,
leaning
on
my
arm
,
and
walking
into
the
garden
.
 
<EOS>
I
saw
he
was
still
in
a
tumult
,
as
it
were
;
and
he
took
another
walk
to
avoid
us
.
 
<EOS>
She
called
after
him
,
and
said
,
Brother
,
brother
,
let
me
speak
to
you
!
 
<EOS>
One
word
with
you
!
 
<EOS>
And
as
we
made
haste
towards
him
,
and
came
near
to
him
;
I
desire
,
said
he
,
that
you
'll
not
oppress
me
more
with
your
follies
,
and
your
violence
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
borne
too
much
with
you
,
and
I
will
vow
for
a
twelvemonth
,
from
this
day
 
Hush
,
<EOS>
said
she
,
do
n't
vow
<EOS>
,
I
beg
you
for
too
well
<EOS>
will
you
keep
it
,
I
know
by
experience
,
if
you
do
.
 
<EOS>
You
see
,
said
she
,
I
stoop
to
ask
Pamela
to
be
my
advocate
.
 
<EOS>
Sure
that
will
pacify
you
!
  
<EOS>
Indeed
,
said
he
,
<EOS>
I
desire
to
see
neither
of
you
,
on
such
an
occasion
;
and
let
me
only
be
left
to
myself
,
for
I
will
not
be
intruded
upon
thus
;
and
was
going
away
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
said
she
,
One
word
first
,
I
desire
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
'll
forgive
me
,
I
'll
forgive
you
.
 
<EOS>
What
,
said
the
dear
man
,
haughtily
,
will
you
forgive
me
?
 
<EOS>
Why
,
said
she
,
for
she
saw
him
too
angry
to
mention
his
marriage
,
as
a
subject
that
required
her
pardon
 
<EOS>
I
will
forgive
you
all
your
bad
usage
of
me
this
day
.
  
<EOS>
I
will
be
serious
with
you
,
sister
,
said
he
:
I
wish
you
most
sincerely
well
;
but
let
us
,
from
this
time
,
study
so
much
one
<EOS>
another
's
quiet
,
as
never
to
come
near
one
another
more
.
 
<EOS>
Never
?
said
she
.
 
<EOS>
And
can
you
desire
this
?
<EOS>
barbarous
brother
!
<EOS>
can
you
?
 
<EOS>
I
can
,
I
do
,
said
he
;
and
I
have
nothing
to
do
,
but
to
hide
from
you
,
not
a
brother
,
but
a
murderer
,
and
a
profligate
,
unworthy
of
your
relation
;
and
let
me
be
consigned
to
penitence
for
my
past
evils
:
<EOS>
A
penitence
,
however
,
that
shall
not
be
broken
in
upon
by
so
violent
an
accuser
.
  
<EOS>
Pamela
,
said
he
,
and
made
me
tremble
,
How
dare
you
approach
me
,
without
leave
,
when
you
see
me
thus
disturbed
?
 
<EOS>
Never
,
for
the
future
,
come
near
me
,
when
I
am
in
these
tumults
,
unless
I
send
for
you
.
  
<EOS>
Dear
sir
!
<EOS>
said
I
 
<EOS>
Leave
me
,
interrupted
he
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
set
out
for
Bedfordshire
this
moment
!
 
<EOS>
What
!
<EOS>
sir
,
said
I
,
without
me
?
 
<EOS>
What
have
I
done
?
 
<EOS>
You
have
too
meanly
,
said
he
,
for
my
wife
,
stooped
to
this
furious
sister
of
mine
;
and
,
till
I
can
recollect
,
I
am
not
pleased
with
you
:
<EOS>
But
Colbrand
shall
attend
you
,
and
two
other
of
my
servants
;
and
Mrs.
Jewkes
shall
wait
upon
you
part
of
the
way
:
<EOS>
And
I
hope
you
'll
find
me
in
a
better
disposition
to
receive
you
there
,
than
I
am
at
parting
with
you
here
.
  
<EOS>
Had
I
not
hoped
,
that
this
was
partly
put
on
to
intimidate
my
lady
,
I
believe
I
could
not
have
borne
it
:
<EOS>
But
it
was
grievous
to
me
;
for
I
saw
he
was
most
sincerely
in
a
passion
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
afraid
,
said
she
,
he
would
be
angry
at
you
,
as
well
as
me
;
for
well
do
I
know
his
unreasonable
violence
,
when
he
is
moved
.
 
<EOS>
But
one
word
,
sir
,
said
she
;
<EOS>
Pardon
Pamela
,
if
you
wo
n't
me
;
for
she
has
committed
no
offence
,
but
that
of
good
-
nature
to
me
,
and
at
my
request
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
be
gone
myself
,
directly
as
I
was
about
to
do
,
had
you
not
prevented
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
prevented
you
,
said
he
,
through
love
;
but
you
have
strung
me
for
it
,
through
hatred
.
 
<EOS>
But
as
for
my
Pamela
,
I
know
,
besides
the
present
moment
,
I
can
not
be
angry
with
her
;
and
therefore
I
desire
her
never
to
see
me
,
on
such
occasions
,
till
I
can
see
her
in
the
temper
I
ought
to
be
in
,
when
so
much
sweetness
approaches
me
.
 
<EOS>
'
<EOS>
Tis
<EOS>
therefore
I
say
,
my
dearest
,
leave
me
now
.
  
<EOS>
But
,
sir
,
said
I
,
must
I
leave
you
,
and
let
you
go
to
Bedfordshire
without
me
?
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
dear
sir
,
how
can
I
?
 
<EOS>
Said
my
lady
<EOS>
,
You
may
go
to
-
morrow
,
both
of
you
,
as
you
had
designed
;
and
I
will
go
away
this
afternoon
:
<EOS>
And
,
since
I
can
not
be
forgiven
,
will
try
to
forget
I
have
a
brother
.
  
<EOS>
May
I
,
sir
,
said
I
,
beg
all
your
anger
on
myself
,
and
to
be
reconciled
to
your
good
sister
?
 
<EOS>
Presuming
Pamela
!
<EOS>
replied
he
,
and
made
me
start
;
<EOS>
Art
thou
then
<EOS>
so
hardy
,
so
well
able
to
sustain
a
displeasure
,
which
of
all
things
,
I
expected
from
thy
affection
,
and
thy
tenderness
,
thou
would'st
have
wished
to
avoid
?
 
<EOS>
Now
,
said
he
,
and
took
my
hand
,
and
,
as
it
were
,
tossed
it
from
him
,
begone
from
my
presence
,
and
reflect
upon
what
you
have
said
to
me
!
  
<EOS>
I
was
so
frightened
,
<EOS>
(
for
then
I
saw
he
took
amiss
what
I
said
,
)
that
I
took
hold
of
his
knees
,
as
he
was
turning
from
me
;
and
I
said
,
Forgive
me
,
good
sir
!
<EOS>
you
see
I
am
not
so
hardy
!
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
bear
your
displeasure
!
<EOS>
And
was
ready
to
sink
.
  
<EOS>
His
sister
said
,
Only
forgive
Pamela
;
'
tis
all
I
ask
 
You
'll
break
her
spirit
quite
!
 
<EOS>
You
'll
carry
your
passion
as
much
too
far
as
I
have
done
!
  
<EOS>
I
 
need
not
say
,
said
he
,
<EOS>
how
well
I
love
her
;
but
she
must
not
intrude
upon
me
at
such
times
as
these
!
 
<EOS>
I
had
intended
,
as
soon
as
I
could
have
quelled
,
by
my
reason
,
the
tumults
you
had
caused
by
your
violence
,
to
have
come
in
,
and
taken
such
a
leave
of
you
both
,
as
might
become
a
husband
,
and
a
brother
:
<EOS>
But
she
has
,
unbidden
<EOS>
,
broke
in
upon
me
,
and
must
take
the
consequence
of
a
passion
,
which
,
when
raised
,
is
as
uncontrollable
as
your
own
.
  
<EOS>
Said
she
,
Did
I
not
love
you
so
well
,
as
sister
never
loved
a
brother
,
I
should
not
have
given
you
all
this
trouble
.
 
<EOS>
And
did
I
not
,
said
he
,
love
you
better
than
you
are
resolved
to
deserve
,
I
should
be
indifferent
to
all
you
say
.
 
<EOS>
But
this
last
instance
,
after
the
duelling
story
(
which
you
would
not
have
mentioned
,
had
you
not
known
it
is
always
matter
of
concern
for
me
to
think
upon
)
,
of
poor
Sally
Godfrey
,
is
a
piece
of
spite
and
meanness
,
that
I
can
renounce
you
my
blood
for
.
  
<EOS>
Well
,
said
she
<EOS>
,
I
am
convinced
it
was
wrong
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
ashamed
of
it
myself
.
'
<EOS>
Twas
poor
,
'
twas
mean
,
'
twas
unworthy
of
your
sister
:
<EOS>
And
'
tis
for
this
reason
I
stoop
to
follow
you
,
to
beg
your
pardon
,
and
even
to
procure
one
for
my
advocate
,
who
I
thought
had
some
interest
in
you
,
if
I
might
have
believed
your
own
professions
to
her
;
which
now
I
shall
begin
to
think
made
purposely
to
insult
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
care
not
what
you
think
!
 
<EOS>
After
the
meanness
you
have
been
guilty
of
,
I
can
only
look
upon
you
with
pity
:
<EOS>
For
,
indeed
,
you
have
fallen
very
low
with
me
.
  
<EOS>
@@@Tis
<EOS>
plain
I
have
,
said
she
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
'll
begone
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
,
brother
,
let
me
call
you
for
this
once
!
 
<EOS>
God
bless
you
!
 
<EOS>
And
Pamela
,
said
her
ladyship
,
God
bless
you
!
<EOS>
and
kissed
me
,
and
wept
.
  
<EOS>
I
durst
say
no
more
:
<EOS>
And
my
lady
turning
from
him
,
he
said
,
Your
sex
is
the
d####l
!
<EOS>
how
strangely
can
you
discompose
,
calm
,
and
turn
,
as
you
please
,
us
poor
weathercocks
of
men
!
 
<EOS>
Your
last
kind
blessing
to
my
Pamela
I
can
not
stand
!
 
<EOS>
Kiss
but
each
other
again
.
 
<EOS>
And
then
he
took
both
our
hands
,
and
joined
them
;
and
my
lady
saluting
me
again
,
with
tears
on
both
sides
,
he
put
his
kind
arms
about
each
of
our
waists
,
and
saluted
us
with
great
affection
,
saying
,
Now
,
God
bless
you
both
,
the
two
dearest
creatures
I
have
in
the
world
!
  
<EOS>
Well
,
said
she
,
you
will
quite
forget
my
fault
about
Miss
 
<EOS>
He
stopt
her
before
she
could
speak
the
name
,
and
said
,
For
ever
forget
it
!
 
<EOS>
And
,
Pamela
,
I
'll
forgive
you
too
,
if
you
do
n't
again
make
my
displeasure
so
light
a
thing
to
you
,
as
you
did
just
now
.
  
<EOS>
Said
my
lady
<EOS>
,
She
did
not
make
your
displeasure
a
light
thing
to
her
;
but
the
heavier
it
was
,
the
higher
compliment
she
made
me
,
that
she
would
bear
it
all
,
rather
than
not
see
you
and
me
reconciled
.
 
<EOS>
No
matter
for
that
,
said
he
:
<EOS>
It
was
either
an
absence
of
thought
,
or
a
slight
by
implication
,
at
least
,
that
my
niceness
could
not
bear
from
her
tenderness
:
<EOS>
For
looked
it
not
presuming
,
that
she
could
stand
my
displeasure
,
or
was
sure
of
making
her
terms
when
she
pleased
?
 
<EOS>
Which
,
fond
as
I
am
of
her
,
I
assure
her
,
will
not
be
always
,
in
wilful
faults
,
in
her
power
.
  
<EOS>
Nay
,
said
my
lady
,
I
can
tell
you
,
Pamela
,
you
have
a
gentleman
here
in
my
brother
;
and
you
may
expect
such
treatment
from
him
,
as
that
character
,
and
his
known
good
sense
and
breeding
,
will
always
oblige
him
to
shew
:
<EOS>
But
if
you
offend
,
the
Lord
have
mercy
upon
you
!
 
<EOS>
You
see
how
it
is
by
poor
me
!
 
<EOS>
And
yet
I
never
knew
him
to
forgive
so
soon
.
  
<EOS>
I
am
sure
,
said
I
,
I
will
take
care
as
much
as
I
can
;
for
I
have
been
frightened
out
of
my
wits
,
and
had
offended
,
before
I
knew
where
I
was
.
  
<EOS>
So
happily
did
this
storm
blow
over
;
and
my
lady
was
quite
subdued
and
pacified
.
  
<EOS>
When
we
came
out
of
the
garden
,
his
chariot
was
ready
;
and
he
said
,
Well
,
sister
,
I
had
most
assuredly
gone
away
towards
my
other
house
,
if
things
had
not
taken
this
happy
turn
;
and
,
if
you
please
,
instead
of
it
,
you
and
I
will
take
an
airing
:
And
pray
,
my
dear
,
said
he
to
me
,
bid
Mrs.
Jewkes
order
supper
by
eight
o'clock
,
and
we
shall
then
join
you
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
,
added
he
,
to
her
nephew
,
will
you
take
your
horse
and
escort
us
?
 
<EOS>
I
will
,
said
he
:
and
am
glad
,
at
my
soul
,
to
see
you
all
so
good
friends
.
  
<EOS>
So
my
dear
lord
and
master
handed
my
lady
into
his
chariot
,
and
her
kinsman
and
his
servants
rode
after
them
<EOS>
and
I
went
up
to
my
closet
to
ruminate
on
these
things
.
 
<EOS>
And
,
foolish
thing
that
I
am
,
this
poor
Miss
Sally
Godfrey
runs
into
my
head
!
 
<EOS>
How
soon
the
name
and
quality
of
a
wife
gives
one
privileges
,
in
one
's
own
account
!
 
<EOS>
Yet
,
methinks
,
I
want
to
know
more
about
her
;
for
,
is
it
not
strange
,
that
I
,
who
lived
years
in
the
family
,
should
have
heard
nothing
of
this
?
 
<EOS>
But
I
was
so
constantly
with
my
lady
,
that
I
might
the
less
hear
of
it
;
for
she
,
I
dare
say
,
never
knew
it
,
or
she
would
have
told
me
.
  
<EOS>
But
I
dare
not
ask
him
about
the
poor
lady
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
I
wonder
what
became
of
her
!
 
<EOS>
Whether
she
be
living
?
 
<EOS>
And
whether
any
thing
came
of
it
?
 
<EOS>
May
be
<EOS>
I
shall
hear
full
soon
enough
!
 
<EOS>
But
I
hope
not
to
any
bad
purpose
.
  
<EOS>
As
to
the
other
unhappy
case
,
I
know
it
was
talked
of
,
that
in
his
travels
,
before
I
was
taken
into
the
family
long
,
he
had
one
or
two
broils
;
and
,
from
a
youth
,
he
was
always
remarkable
for
courage
,
and
is
reckoned
a
great
master
of
his
sword
.
 
<EOS>
God
grant
he
may
never
be
put
to
use
it
!
<EOS>
and
that
he
may
be
always
preserved
in
honour
and
safety
!
  
<EOS>
About
seven
o'clock
<EOS>
my
master
sent
word
,
that
he
would
have
me
not
expect
him
to
supper
;
for
that
he
,
and
my
lady
his
sister
,
and
nephew
,
were
prevailed
upon
to
stay
with
Lady
Jones
;
and
that
Lady
Darnford
,
and
Mr.
Peters
's
family
,
had
promised
to
meet
them
there
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
glad
they
did
not
send
for
me
;
and
the
rather
,
as
I
hoped
those
good
families
being
my
friends
,
would
confirm
my
lady
a
little
in
my
favour
;
and
so
I
followed
my
writing
closely
.
  
<EOS>
About
eleven
o'clock
they
returned
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
but
just
come
down
,
<EOS>
having
tired
myself
with
my
pen
,
and
was
sitting
talking
with
Mrs.
Jewkes
and
Mrs.
Worden
,
whom
I
would
,
though
unwillingly
on
their
sides
,
make
sit
down
,
which
they
did
over
against
me
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Worden
asked
my
pardon
,
in
a
good
deal
of
confusion
,
for
the
part
she
had
acted
against
me
;
saying
,
That
things
had
been
very
differently
represented
to
her
;
and
that
she
little
thought
I
was
married
,
and
that
she
was
behaving
so
rudely
to
the
lady
of
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
I
said
,
I
took
nothing
amiss
;
and
very
freely
forgave
her
;
and
hoped
my
new
condition
would
not
make
me
forget
how
to
behave
properly
to
every
one
;
but
that
I
must
endeavour
to
act
not
unworthy
of
it
,
for
the
honour
of
the
gentleman
who
had
so
generously
raised
me
to
it
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
said
,
that
my
situation
gave
me
great
opportunities
of
shewing
the
excellence
of
my
nature
,
that
I
could
forgive
offences
against
me
so
readily
,
as
she
,
for
her
own
part
,
must
always
,
she
said
,
acknowledge
,
with
confusion
of
face
.
  
<EOS>
People
,
said
I
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
do
n't
know
how
they
shall
act
,
when
their
wills
are
in
the
power
of
their
superiors
;
and
I
always
thought
one
should
distinguish
between
acts
of
malice
,
and
of
implicit
obedience
;
though
,
at
the
same
time
,
a
person
should
know
how
to
judge
between
lawful
and
unlawful
.
 
<EOS>
And
even
the
great
,
though
at
present
angry
<EOS>
they
are
not
obeyed
,
will
afterwards
have
no
ill
opinion
of
a
person
for
withstanding
them
in
their
unlawful
commands
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
seemed
a
little
concerned
at
this
;
and
I
said
,
I
spoke
chiefly
from
my
own
experience
:
For
that
I
might
say
,
as
they
both
knew
my
story
,
that
I
had
not
wanted
both
for
menaces
and
temptations
;
and
had
I
complied
with
the
one
,
or
been
intimidated
by
the
other
<EOS>
,
I
should
not
have
been
what
I
was
.
  
<EOS>
Ah
,
madam
!
<EOS>
replied
Mrs.
Jewkes
<EOS>
,
I
never
knew
any
body
like
you
;
and
I
think
your
temper
sweeter
,
since
the
happy
day
,
than
before
;
and
that
,
if
possible
,
you
take
less
upon
you
.
  
<EOS>
Why
,
a
good
reason
,
said
I
,
may
be
assigned
for
that
:
I
thought
myself
in
danger
:
<EOS>
I
looked
upon
every
one
as
my
enemy
;
and
it
was
impossible
that
I
should
not
be
fretful
,
uneasy
,
jealous
.
 
<EOS>
But
when
my
dearest
friend
had
taken
from
me
the
ground
of
my
uneasiness
,
and
made
me
quite
happy
,
I
should
have
been
very
blamable
,
if
I
had
not
shewn
a
satisfied
and
easy
mind
,
and
a
temper
that
should
engage
every
one
's
respect
and
love
at
the
same
time
,
if
possible
:
<EOS>
And
so
much
the
more
,
as
it
was
but
justifying
,
in
some
sort
,
the
honour
I
had
received
:
For
the
fewer
enemies
I
made
myself
,
the
more
I
engaged
every
one
to
think
,
that
my
good
benefactor
had
been
less
to
blame
in
descending
as
he
has
done
.
  
<EOS>
This
way
of
talking
pleased
them
both
very
much
;
and
they
made
me
many
compliments
upon
it
,
and
wished
me
always
to
be
happy
,
as
,
they
said
,
I
so
well
deserved
.
  
<EOS>
We
were
thus
engaged
,
when
my
master
,
and
his
sister
and
her
nephew
,
came
in
:
and
they
made
me
quite
alive
,
in
the
happy
humour
in
which
they
all
returned
.
 
<EOS>
The
two
women
would
have
withdrawn
:
but
my
master
said
,
Do
n't
go
,
Mrs.
Worden
:
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
pray
stay
;
I
shall
speak
to
you
presently
.
<EOS>
So
he
came
to
me
,
and
,
saluting
me
,
said
,
<EOS>
Well
,
my
dear
love
,
I
hope
I
have
not
trespassed
upon
your
patience
,
by
an
absence
longer
than
we
designed
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
has
not
been
to
your
disadvantage
;
for
though
we
had
not
your
company
,
we
have
talked
of
nobody
else
but
you
.
  
<EOS>
My
lady
came
up
to
me
,
and
said
,
Ay
,
child
,
you
have
been
all
our
subject
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
how
it
is
:
but
you
have
made
two
or
three
good
families
,
in
this
neighbourhood
,
as
much
your
admirers
,
as
your
friend
here
.
  
<EOS>
My
sister
,
said
he
,
has
been
hearing
your
praises
,
Pamela
,
from
half
a
score
mouths
,
with
more
pleasure
than
her
heart
will
easily
let
her
express
.
  
<EOS>
My
good
Lady
Davers
's
favour
,
said
I
,
and
the
continuance
of
yours
,
sir
,
would
give
me
more
pride
than
that
of
all
the
rest
of
the
world
put
together
.
  
<EOS>
Well
,
child
,
said
she
,
proud
hearts
do
n't
come
down
all
at
once
;
though
my
brother
,
here
,
has
this
day
set
mine
a
good
many
pegs
lower
than
I
ever
knew
it
:
<EOS>
But
I
will
say
,
I
wish
you
joy
with
my
brother
;
and
so
kissed
me
.
  
<EOS>
My
dear
lady
,
said
I
,
you
for
ever
oblige
me
!
 
<EOS>
I
shall
now
believe
myself
quite
happy
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
all
I
wanted
to
make
me
so
!
 
<EOS>
And
I
hope
I
shall
always
,
through
my
life
,
shew
your
ladyship
,
that
I
have
the
most
grateful
and
respectful
sense
of
your
goodness
.
  
<EOS>
But
,
child
,
said
she
,
I
shall
not
give
you
my
company
when
you
make
your
appearance
.
 
<EOS>
Let
your
own
merit
make
all
your
Bedfordshire
neighbours
your
friends
,
as
it
has
done
here
,
by
your
Lincolnshire
ones
;
and
you
'll
have
no
need
of
my
countenance
,
nor
any
body
's
else
.
  
<EOS>
Now
,
said
her
nephew
,
'
tis
my
turn
:
I
wish
you
joy
with
all
my
soul
,
madam
;
and
,
by
what
I
have
seen
,
and
by
what
I
have
heard
,
"
fore
Gad
,
I
think
you
have
met
with
no
more
than
you
deserve
;
and
so
all
the
company
says
,
where
we
have
been
:
<EOS>
And
pray
forgive
all
my
nonsense
to
you
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
,
said
I
,
I
shall
always
,
I
hope
,
respect
as
I
ought
,
so
near
a
relation
of
my
good
Lord
and
Lady
Davers
;
and
I
thank
you
for
your
kind
compliment
.
  
<EOS>
Gad
,
Beck
,
said
he
,
I
believe
you
've
some
forgiveness
too
to
ask
;
for
we
were
all
to
blame
,
to
make
madam
,
here
,
fly
the
pit
,
as
she
did
.
 
<EOS>
Little
did
we
think
we
made
her
quit
her
own
house
.
  
<EOS>
Thou
always
,
said
my
lady
,
sayest
too
much
,
or
too
little
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Worden
said
,
I
have
been
treated
with
so
much
goodness
and
condescension
since
you
went
,
that
I
have
been
beforehand
,
sir
,
in
asking
pardon
myself
.
  
<EOS>
So
my
lady
sat
down
with
me
half
an
hour
,
and
told
me
,
that
her
brother
had
carried
her
a
fine
airing
,
and
had
quite
charmed
her
with
his
kind
treatment
of
her
;
and
had
much
confirmed
her
in
the
good
opinion
she
had
begun
to
entertain
of
my
discreet
and
obliging
behaviour
:
<EOS>
But
,
continued
she
,
when
he
would
make
me
visit
,
without
intending
to
stay
,
my
old
neighbours
,
(
for
,
said
she
,
Lady
Jones
being
nearest
,
we
visited
her
first
;
and
she
scraped
all
the
rest
of
the
company
together
,
)
<EOS>
they
were
all
so
full
of
your
praises
,
that
I
was
quite
borne
down
;
and
,
truly
,
it
was
Saul
among
the
prophets
!
  
<EOS>
You
may
believe
how
much
I
was
delighted
with
this
;
and
I
spared
not
my
due
acknowledgments
.
  
<EOS>
When
her
ladyship
took
leave
,
to
go
to
bed
,
she
said
,
Goodnight
to
you
,
heartily
,
and
to
your
good
man
.
 
<EOS>
I
kissed
you
when
I
came
in
,
out
of
form
;
but
I
now
kiss
you
out
of
more
than
form
,
I
'll
assure
you
.
  
<EOS>
Join
with
me
,
my
dear
parents
,
in
my
joy
for
this
happy
turn
;
the
contrary
of
which
I
so
much
dreaded
,
and
was
the
only
difficulty
I
had
to
labour
with
.
 
<EOS>
This
poor
Miss
Sally
Godfrey
,
I
wonder
what
's
become
of
her
,
poor
soul
!
 
<EOS>
I
wish
he
would
,
of
his
own
head
,
mention
her
again
.
  
<EOS>
Not
that
I
am
very
uneasy
,
neither
.
 
<EOS>
You
'll
say
,
I
must
be
a
little
saucy
,
if
I
was
.
  
<EOS>
My
dear
master
gave
me
an
account
,
when
we
went
up
,
of
the
pains
he
had
taken
with
his
beloved
sister
,
as
he
himself
styled
her
;
and
of
all
the
kind
things
the
good
families
had
said
in
my
behalf
;
and
that
he
observed
she
was
not
so
much
displeased
with
hearing
them
,
as
she
was
at
first
;
when
she
would
not
permit
any
body
to
speak
of
me
as
his
wife
:
And
that
my
health
,
as
his
spouse
,
being
put
;
when
it
came
to
her
,
she
drank
it
;
but
said
,
Come
,
brother
<EOS>
,
here
's
your
Pamela
to
you
:
<EOS>
But
I
shall
not
know
how
to
stand
this
affair
,
when
the
Countess
 
,
and
the
young
ladies
,
come
to
visit
me
.
 
<EOS>
One
of
these
young
ladies
was
the
person
she
was
so
fond
of
promoting
a
match
for
,
with
her
brother
.
 
<EOS>
Lady
Betty
,
I
know
,
she
said
,
will
rally
me
smartly
upon
it
;
and
you
know
,
brother
,
she
wants
neither
wit
nor
satire
.
 
<EOS>
He
said
,
I
hope
,
<EOS>
Lady
Betty
,
whenever
she
marries
,
will
meet
with
a
better
husband
than
I
should
have
made
her
;
for
,
in
my
conscience
,
I
think
I
should
hardly
have
made
a
tolerable
one
to
any
but
Pamela
.
  
<EOS>
He
told
me
that
they
rallied
him
on
the
stateliness
of
his
temper
;
and
said
,
They
saw
he
would
make
an
exceeding
good
husband
where
he
was
;
but
it
must
be
owing
to
my
meekness
,
more
than
to
his
complaisance
;
for
,
said
Miss
Darnford
,
I
could
see
well
enough
,
when
your
ladyship
detained
her
,
though
he
had
but
hinted
his
desire
of
finding
her
at
our
house
,
he
was
so
out
of
humour
at
her
supposed
noncompliance
,
that
mine
and
my
sister
's
pity
for
her
was
much
more
engaged
,
than
our
envy
.
  
<EOS>
Ay
,
said
my
lady
,
he
is
too
lordly
a
creature
,
by
much
;
and
ca
n't
bear
disappointment
,
nor
ever
could
.
  
<EOS>
Said
he
,
<EOS>
Well
,
Lady
Davers
,
you
should
not
,
of
all
persons
,
find
fault
with
me
;
for
I
bore
a
great
deal
from
you
,
before
I
was
at
all
angry
.
  
<EOS>
Yes
,
replied
she
:
but
when
I
had
gone
a
little
too
far
,
as
I
own
<EOS>
I
did
,
you
made
me
pay
for
it
severely
enough
!
 
<EOS>
You
know
you
did
,
sauce
-
box
.
<EOS>
And
the
poor
thing
too
,
added
she
,
that
I
took
with
me
for
my
advocate
,
so
low
had
he
brought
me
!
<EOS>
he
treated
her
in
such
a
manner
as
made
my
heart
ache
for
her
:
<EOS>
But
part
was
art
,
I
know
,
to
make
me
think
the
better
of
her
.
  
<EOS>
Indeed
,
sister
,
said
he
,
there
was
very
little
of
that
;
for
,
at
that
time
,
I
cared
not
what
you
thought
,
nor
had
complaisance
enough
to
have
given
a
shilling
for
your
good
or
bad
opinion
of
her
or
me
.
 
<EOS>
And
,
I
own
,
I
was
displeased
to
be
broken
in
upon
,
after
your
provocations
,
by
either
of
you
<EOS>
and
she
must
learn
that
lesson
,
never
to
come
near
me
,
when
I
am
in
those
humours
;
which
shall
be
as
little
as
possible
<EOS>
:
For
,
after
a
while
,
if
let
alone
,
I
always
come
to
myself
,
and
am
sorry
for
the
violence
of
a
temper
,
so
like
my
dear
sister
's
here
:
<EOS>
And
,
for
this
reason
think
it
is
no
matter
how
few
witnesses
I
have
of
its
intemperance
,
while
it
lasts
;
especially
since
every
witness
,
whether
they
merit
it
or
not
,
as
you
see
in
my
Pamela
's
case
,
must
be
a
sufferer
by
it
,
if
,
unsent
for
,
they
come
in
my
way
.
  
<EOS>
He
repeated
the
same
lesson
to
me
again
,
and
enforced
it
and
owned
,
that
he
was
angry
with
me
in
earnest
,
just
then
;
though
more
with
himself
,
afterwards
,
for
being
so
:
But
when
,
Pamela
,
said
he
,
you
wanted
to
transfer
all
my
displeasure
upon
yourself
,
it
was
so
much
braving
me
with
your
merit
,
as
if
I
must
soon
end
my
anger
,
if
placed
there
;
or
it
was
making
it
so
light
to
you
,
that
I
was
truly
displeased
:
for
,
continued
he
,
<EOS>
I
can
not
bear
that
you
should
wish
,
on
any
occasion
whatever
,
to
have
me
angry
with
you
,
or
not
to
value
my
displeasure
as
the
heaviest
misfortune
that
could
befall
you
.
  
<EOS>
But
,
sir
,
said
I
,
you
know
,
that
what
I
did
was
to
try
to
reconcile
my
lady
;
and
,
as
she
herself
observed
,
it
was
paying
her
a
high
regard
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
so
,
replied
he
;
but
never
think
of
making
a
compliment
to
her
,
or
any
body
living
,
at
my
expense
.
 
<EOS>
Besides
,
she
had
behaved
herself
so
intolerably
,
that
I
began
to
think
you
had
stooped
too
much
,
and
more
than
I
ought
to
permit
my
wife
to
do
;
and
acts
of
meanness
are
what
I
ca
n't
endure
in
any
body
,
but
especially
where
I
love
:
and
as
she
had
been
guilty
of
a
very
signal
one
,
I
had
much
rather
have
renounced
her
at
that
time
,
than
have
been
reconciled
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
,
said
I
,
<EOS>
I
hope
I
shall
always
comport
myself
so
,
as
not
wilfully
to
disoblige
you
for
the
future
;
and
the
rather
do
I
hope
this
,
as
I
am
sure
I
shall
want
only
to
know
your
pleasure
to
obey
it
.
 
<EOS>
But
this
instance
shews
me
,
that
I
may
much
offend
,
without
designing
it
in
the
least
.
  
<EOS>
Now
,
Pamela
,
replied
he
,
do
n't
be
too
serious
<EOS>
:
I
hope
I
sha
n't
be
a
very
tyrannical
husband
to
you
:
<EOS>
Yet
do
I
not
pretend
to
be
perfect
,
or
to
be
always
governed
by
reason
in
my
first
transports
;
and
I
expect
,
from
your
affection
,
that
you
will
bear
with
me
when
you
find
me
wrong
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
ungrateful
spirit
,
and
can
,
when
cool
,
enter
as
impartially
into
myself
as
most
men
;
and
then
I
am
always
kind
and
acknowledging
,
in
proportion
as
I
have
been
out
of
the
way
.
  
<EOS>
But
to
convince
you
,
my
dear
,
continued
he
,
of
your
fault
,
<EOS>
(
I
mean
,
with
regard
to
the
impetuosity
of
my
temper
;
for
there
was
no
fault
in
your
intention
,
that
I
acknowledge
,
)
<EOS>
I
'll
observe
only
,
that
you
met
,
when
you
came
to
me
,
while
I
was
so
out
of
humour
,
a
reception
you
did
not
expect
,
and
a
harsh
word
or
two
that
you
did
not
deserve
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
had
you
not
broken
in
upon
me
while
my
anger
lasted
,
but
staid
till
I
had
come
to
you
,
or
sent
to
desire
your
company
,
you
'd
have
seen
none
of
this
;
but
that
affectionate
behaviour
,
which
I
doubt
not
you
'll
always
merit
,
and
I
shall
always
take
pleasure
in
expressing
:
and
in
this
temper
shall
you
always
find
a
proper
influence
over
me
:
<EOS>
But
you
must
not
suppose
,
whenever
I
am
out
of
humour
,
that
,
in
opposing
yourself
to
my
passion
,
you
oppose
a
proper
butt
to
it
;
but
when
you
are
so
good
,
like
the
slender
reed
,
to
bend
to
the
hurricane
,
rather
than
,
like
the
sturdy
oak
,
to
resist
it
<EOS>
,
you
will
always
stand
firm
in
my
kind
opinion
,
while
a
contrary
conduct
would
uproot
you
,
with
all
your
excellencies
,
from
my
soul
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
,
said
I
,
I
will
endeavour
to
conform
myself
,
in
all
things
,
to
your
will
.
 
<EOS>
I
make
no
doubt
<EOS>
but
you
will
:
<EOS>
and
I
'll
endeavour
to
make
my
will
as
conformable
to
reason
as
I
can
.
 
<EOS>
And
let
me
tell
you
,
that
this
belief
of
you
is
one
of
the
inducements
I
have
had
to
marry
at
all
:
for
nobody
was
more
averse
to
this
state
than
myself
;
and
,
now
we
are
upon
this
subject
,
I
'll
tell
you
why
I
was
so
averse
.
  
<EOS>
We
people
of
fortune
,
or
such
as
are
born
to
large
expectations
,
of
both
sexes
,
are
generally
educated
wrong
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
occasionally
touched
upon
this
,
Pamela
,
several
times
in
your
journal
,
so
justly
,
<EOS>
that
I
need
say
the
less
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
We
are
usually
so
headstrong
,
so
violent
in
our
wills
,
that
we
very
little
bear
control
.
  
<EOS>
Humoured
by
our
nurses
,
through
the
faults
of
our
parents
,
we
practise
first
upon
them
;
and
shew
the
gratitude
of
our
dispositions
,
in
an
insolence
that
ought
rather
to
be
checked
and
restrained
,
than
encouraged
.
  
<EOS>
Next
,
we
are
to
be
indulged
in
every
thing
at
school
;
and
our
masters
and
mistresses
are
rewarded
with
further
grateful
instances
of
our
boisterous
behaviour
.
  
<EOS>
But
,
in
our
wise
parents
'
eyes
,
all
looks
well
,
<EOS>
all
is
forgiven
and
excused
;
and
for
no
other
reason
,
but
because
we
are
theirs
.
  
<EOS>
Our
next
progression
is
,
we
exercise
our
spirits
,
when
brought
home
,
to
the
torment
and
regret
of
our
parents
themselves
,
and
torture
their
hearts
by
our
undutiful
and
perverse
behaviour
to
them
,
which
,
however
ungrateful
in
us
,
is
but
the
natural
consequence
of
their
culpable
indulgence
to
us
,
from
infancy
upwards
.
  
<EOS>
And
then
,
next
,
after
we
have
,
perhaps
,
half
broken
their
hearts
,
a
wife
is
looked
out
for
:
convenience
,
or
birth
,
or
fortune
<EOS>
,
are
the
first
motives
,
affection
the
last
(
if
it
is
at
all
consulted
)
:
and
two
people
thus
educated
,
thus
trained
up
,
in
a
course
of
unnatural
ingratitude
,
and
who
have
been
headstrong
torments
to
every
one
who
has
had
a
share
in
their
education
,
as
well
as
to
those
to
whom
they
owe
their
being
,
are
brought
together
;
and
what
can
be
expected
,
but
that
they
should
pursue
,
and
carry
on
,
the
same
comfortable
conduct
in
matrimony
,
and
join
most
heartily
to
plague
one
another
?
 
<EOS>
And
,
in
some
measure
,
indeed
,
this
is
right
;
because
hereby
they
revenge
the
cause
of
all
those
who
have
been
aggrieved
and
insulted
by
them
,
upon
one
another
.
  
<EOS>
The
gentleman
has
never
been
controlled
:
the
lady
has
never
been
contradicted
.
  
<EOS>
He
can
not
bear
it
from
one
whose
new
relation
,
he
thinks
,
should
oblige
her
to
shew
a
quite
contrary
conduct
.
  
<EOS>
She
thinks
it
very
barbarous
,
now
,
for
the
first
time
,
to
be
opposed
in
her
will
,
and
that
by
a
man
from
whom
she
expected
nothing
but
tenderness
.
  
<EOS>
So
great
is
the
difference
between
what
they
both
expect
from
one
another
,
and
what
they
both
find
in
each
other
,
that
no
wonder
misunderstandings
happen
;
that
these
ripen
to
quarrels
;
that
acts
of
unkindness
pass
,
which
,
even
had
the
first
motive
to
their
union
been
affection
,
as
usually
it
is
not
,
would
have
effaced
all
manner
of
tender
impressions
on
both
sides
.
  
<EOS>
Appeals
to
parents
or
guardians
often
ensue
.
 
<EOS>
If
,
by
mediation
of
friends
,
a
reconciliation
takes
place
,
it
hardly
ever
holds
:
for
why
?
<EOS>
The
fault
is
in
the
minds
of
both
,
and
neither
of
them
will
think
so
;
so
that
the
wound
(
not
permitted
to
be
probed
)
<EOS>
is
but
skinned
over
,
and
rankles
still
at
the
bottom
,
and
at
last
breaks
out
with
more
pain
and
anguish
than
before
.
 
<EOS>
Separate
beds
are
often
the
consequence
;
perhaps
elopements
:
if
not
,
an
unconquerable
indifference
,
possibly
aversion
.
<EOS>
And
whenever
,
for
appearance
-
sake
,
they
are
obliged
to
be
together
,
every
one
sees
,
that
the
yawning
husband
,
and
the
vapourish
wife
,
are
truly
insupportable
to
one
another
;
but
separate
,
have
freer
spirits
,
and
can
be
tolerable
company
.
  
<EOS>
Now
,
my
dear
,
I
would
have
you
think
,
and
I
hope
you
will
have
no
other
reason
,
that
had
I
married
the
first
lady
in
the
land
,
I
would
not
have
treated
her
better
than
I
will
my
Pamela
.
 
<EOS>
For
my
wife
is
my
wife
;
and
I
was
the
longer
in
resolving
on
the
state
,
because
I
knew
its
requisites
,
and
doubted
my
conduct
in
it
.
  
<EOS>
I
believe
I
am
more
nice
than
many
gentlemen
;
but
it
is
because
I
have
been
a
close
observer
of
the
behaviour
of
wedded
folks
,
and
hardly
ever
have
seen
it
to
be
such
as
I
could
like
in
my
own
case
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
,
possibly
,
give
you
instances
of
a
more
particular
nature
of
this
,
as
we
are
longer
,
and
,
perhaps
,
I
might
say
,
better
acquainted
.
  
<EOS>
Had
I
married
with
the
views
of
many
gentlemen
,
and
with
such
as
my
good
sister
(
supplying
the
place
of
my
father
and
mother
,
)
would
have
recommended
,
I
had
wedded
a
fine
lady
,
brought
up
pretty
much
in
my
own
manner
,
and
used
to
have
her
will
in
every
thing
.
  
<EOS>
Some
gentlemen
can
come
into
a
compromise
;
and
,
after
a
few
struggles
,
sit
down
tolerably
contented
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
had
I
married
a
princess
,
I
could
not
have
done
so
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
have
loved
her
exceedingly
well
,
before
I
had
consented
to
knit
the
knot
with
her
,
and
preferred
her
to
all
her
sex
;
for
without
this
,
Pamela
,
indifferences
,
if
not
disgusts
,
will
arise
in
every
wedded
life
,
that
could
not
have
made
me
happy
at
home
;
and
there
are
fewer
instances
,
I
believe
,
of
men
's
loving
better
,
after
matrimony
,
than
of
women
's
;
the
reason
of
which
'
tis
not
my
present
purpose
to
account
for
.
  
<EOS>
Then
I
must
have
been
morally
sure
,
that
she
preferred
me
to
all
men
;
and
,
to
convince
me
of
this
,
she
must
have
lessened
,
not
aggravated
,
my
failings
:
<EOS>
She
must
have
borne
with
my
imperfections
;
she
must
have
watched
and
studied
my
temper
;
and
if
ever
she
had
any
points
to
carry
,
any
desire
of
overcoming
,
it
must
have
been
by
sweetness
and
complaisance
;
and
yet
not
such
a
slavish
one
,
as
should
make
her
condescension
seem
to
be
rather
the
effect
of
her
insensibility
,
than
judgment
or
affection
.
  
<EOS>
She
should
not
have
given
cause
for
any
part
of
my
conduct
to
her
to
wear
the
least
aspect
of
compulsion
or
force
.
 
<EOS>
The
word
command
,
on
my
side
,
or
obedience
on
hers
,
I
would
have
blotted
from
my
vocabulary
.
 
<EOS>
For
this
reason
I
should
have
thought
it
my
duty
to
have
desired
nothing
of
her
,
that
was
not
significant
,
reasonable
,
or
just
;
and
that
then
she
should
,
on
hers
,
have
shewn
no
reluctance
,
uneasiness
,
or
doubt
,
to
oblige
me
,
even
at
half
a
word
.
  
<EOS>
I
would
not
have
excused
her
to
let
me
twice
enjoin
the
same
thing
,
while
I
took
so
much
care
to
make
her
compliance
with
me
reasonable
,
and
such
as
should
not
destroy
her
own
free
agency
,
in
points
that
ought
to
be
allowed
her
:
<EOS>
And
if
I
was
not
always
right
,
that
yet
she
would
bear
with
me
,
if
she
saw
me
set
upon
it
;
and
expostulate
with
me
on
the
right
side
of
compliance
;
for
that
would
shew
me
,
(
supposing
small
points
in
dispute
,
from
which
the
greatest
quarrels
,
among
friends
,
generally
arise
,
)
that
she
differed
from
me
,
not
for
contradiction
-
sake
,
but
desired
to
convince
me
for
my
own
;
and
that
I
should
,
another
time
,
take
better
resolutions
.
  
<EOS>
This
would
be
so
obliging
a
conduct
,
that
I
should
,
in
justice
,
have
doubled
my
esteem
for
one
,
who
,
to
humour
me
,
could
give
up
her
own
judgment
;
and
I
should
see
she
could
have
no
other
view
in
her
expostulations
,
after
her
compliance
had
passed
,
than
to
rectify
my
motions
for
the
future
;
and
it
would
have
been
impossible
then
,
but
I
must
have
paid
the
greater
deference
to
her
opinion
and
advice
in
more
momentous
matters
.
  
<EOS>
In
all
companies
she
must
have
shewn
,
that
she
had
,
whether
I
deserved
it
altogether
or
not
,
a
high
regard
and
opinion
of
me
;
and
this
the
rather
,
as
such
a
conduct
in
her
would
be
a
reputation
and
security
to
herself
:
For
if
we
rakes
attempt
a
married
lady
,
our
first
encouragement
,
exclusive
of
our
own
vanity
,
arises
from
the
indifferent
opinion
,
slight
,
or
contempt
,
she
expresses
of
her
husband
.
  
<EOS>
I
should
expect
,
therefore
,
that
she
should
draw
a
kind
veil
over
my
faults
;
that
such
as
she
could
not
hide
,
she
would
extenuate
;
that
she
would
place
my
better
actions
in
an
advantageous
light
,
and
shew
that
I
had
her
good
opinion
,
at
least
,
whatever
liberties
the
world
took
with
my
character
.
  
<EOS>
She
must
have
valued
my
friends
for
my
sake
;
been
cheerful
and
easy
,
whomsoever
I
had
brought
home
with
me
;
and
,
whatever
faults
she
had
observed
in
me
,
have
never
blamed
me
before
company
;
at
least
,
with
such
an
air
of
superiority
,
as
should
have
shewn
she
had
a
better
opinion
of
her
own
judgment
,
than
of
mine
.
  
<EOS>
Now
,
my
Pamela
,
this
is
but
a
faint
sketch
of
the
conduct
I
must
have
expected
from
my
wife
,
<EOS>
let
her
quality
have
been
what
it
would
;
or
have
lived
with
her
on
bad
terms
.
 
<EOS>
Judge
then
,
if
to
me
a
lady
of
the
modish
taste
could
have
been
tolerable
.
  
<EOS>
The
perverseness
and
contradiction
I
have
too
often
seen
,
in
some
of
my
visits
,
even
among
people
of
sense
,
as
well
as
condition
,
had
prejudiced
me
to
the
married
state
;
and
,
as
I
knew
I
could
not
bear
it
,
surely
I
was
in
the
right
to
decline
it
:
<EOS>
And
you
see
,
<EOS>
my
dear
,
that
I
have
not
gone
among
this
class
of
people
for
a
wife
;
nor
know
I
,
indeed
,
where
,
in
any
class
,
I
could
have
sought
one
,
or
had
one
suitable
to
my
mind
,
if
not
you
:
<EOS>
For
here
is
my
misfortune
;
I
could
not
have
been
contented
to
have
been
but
moderately
happy
in
a
wife
.
  
<EOS>
Judge
you
,
from
all
this
,
if
I
could
very
well
bear
that
you
should
think
yourself
so
well
secured
of
my
affection
,
that
you
could
take
the
faults
of
others
upon
yourself
;
and
,
by
a
supposed
supererogatory
merit
,
think
your
interposition
sufficient
to
atone
for
the
faults
of
others
.
  
<EOS>
Yet
am
I
not
perfect
myself
:
<EOS>
No
,
I
am
greatly
imperfect
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
will
I
not
allow
,
that
my
imperfections
shall
excuse
those
of
my
wife
,
or
make
her
think
I
ought
to
bear
faults
in
her
,
that
she
can
rectify
,
because
she
bears
greater
from
me
.
  
<EOS>
Upon
the
whole
,
I
may
expect
,
that
you
will
bear
with
me
,
and
study
my
temper
,
till
,
and
only
till
,
you
see
I
am
capable
of
returning
insult
for
obligation
;
and
till
you
think
,
that
I
shall
be
of
a
gentler
deportment
,
if
I
am
roughly
used
,
than
otherwise
.
 
<EOS>
One
thing
more
I
will
add
,
That
I
should
scorn
myself
,
if
there
was
one
privilege
of
your
sex
,
that
a
princess
might
expect
,
as
my
wife
,
to
be
indulged
in
,
that
I
would
not
allow
to
my
Pamela
;
for
you
are
the
wife
of
my
affections
<EOS>
:
I
never
wished
for
one
before
you
,
nor
ever
do
I
hope
to
have
another
.
  
<EOS>
I
hope
,
sir
,
said
I
,
my
future
conduct
 
<EOS>
Pardon
me
,
said
he
,
my
dear
,
for
interrupting
you
;
but
it
is
to
assure
you
,
that
I
am
so
well
convinced
of
your
affectionate
regard
for
me
,
<EOS>
that
I
know
I
might
have
spared
the
greatest
part
of
what
I
have
said
:
<EOS>
And
,
indeed
,
it
must
be
very
bad
for
both
of
us
,
if
I
should
have
reason
to
think
it
necessary
to
say
so
much
.
<EOS>
But
one
thing
has
brought
on
another
;
and
I
have
rather
spoken
what
my
niceness
has
made
me
observe
in
other
families
,
than
what
I
fear
in
my
own
.
 
<EOS>
And
,
therefore
,
let
me
assure
you
,
I
am
thoroughly
satisfied
with
your
conduct
hitherto
.
 
<EOS>
You
shall
have
no
occasion
to
repent
it
:
<EOS>
And
you
shall
find
,
though
greatly
imperfect
,
and
passionate
,
on
particular
provocations
,
(
<EOS>
which
yet
I
will
try
to
overcome
,
)
that
you
have
not
a
brutal
or
ungenerous
husband
,
who
is
capable
of
offering
insult
for
condescension
,
or
returning
evil
for
good
.
  
<EOS>
I
thanked
him
for
these
kind
rules
,
and
generous
assurances
:
and
assured
him
,
that
they
had
made
so
much
impression
on
my
mind
,
that
these
,
and
his
most
agreeable
injunctions
before
given
me
,
and
such
as
he
should
hereafter
be
pleased
to
give
me
,
should
be
so
many
rules
for
my
future
behaviour
.
  
<EOS>
And
I
am
glad
of
the
method
I
have
taken
of
making
a
Journal
of
all
that
passes
in
these
first
stages
of
my
happiness
,
because
it
will
sink
the
impression
still
deeper
;
and
I
shall
have
recourse
to
them
for
my
better
regulation
,
as
often
as
I
shall
mistrust
my
memory
.
  
<EOS>
Let
me
see
:
What
are
the
rules
I
am
to
observe
from
this
awful
lecture
?
<EOS>
Why
these
:
  
1
.
 
<EOS>
That
I
must
not
,
when
he
is
in
great
wrath
with
any
body
,
break
in
upon
him
without
his
leave
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
I
'll
remember
it
,
I
warrant
.
 
<EOS>
But
yet
I
think
this
rule
is
almost
peculiar
to
himself
.
  
<EOS>
2
.
 
<EOS>
That
I
must
think
his
displeasure
the
heaviest
thing
that
can
befall
me
.
 
<EOS>
To
be
sure
I
shall
.
  
<EOS>
3
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
that
I
must
not
wish
to
incur
it
,
to
save
any
body
else
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
be
further
if
I
do
.
  
<EOS>
4
.
 
<EOS>
That
I
must
never
make
a
compliment
to
any
body
at
his
expense
.
  
<EOS>
5
.
 
<EOS>
That
I
must
not
be
guilty
of
any
acts
of
wilful
meanness
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
a
great
deal
meant
in
this
;
and
I
'll
endeavour
to
observe
it
all
.
 
<EOS>
To
be
sure
,
the
occasion
on
which
he
mentions
this
,
explains
it
;
that
I
must
say
nothing
,
though
in
anger
,
that
is
spiteful
or
malicious
;
that
is
disrespectful
or
undutiful
,
and
such
-
like
.
  
<EOS>
6
.
 
<EOS>
That
I
must
bear
with
him
,
even
when
I
find
him
in
the
wrong
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
a
little
hard
,
as
the
case
may
be
!
  
<EOS>
I
wonder
whether
poor
Miss
Sally
Godfrey
be
living
or
dead
!
  
<EOS>
7
.
 
<EOS>
That
I
must
be
as
flexible
as
the
reed
in
the
fable
,
lest
,
by
resisting
the
tempest
,
like
the
oak
<EOS>
,
I
be
torn
up
by
the
roots
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
I
'll
do
the
best
I
can
!
 
<EOS>
There
is
no
great
likelihood
<EOS>
,
I
hope
,
that
I
should
be
too
perverse
;
yet
sure
,
the
tempest
will
not
lay
me
quite
level
with
the
ground
,
neither
.
  
<EOS>
8
.
 
<EOS>
That
the
education
of
young
people
of
condition
is
generally
wrong
.
<EOS>
Memorandum
;
That
if
any
part
of
children
's
education
fall
to
my
lot
,
I
never
indulge
and
humour
them
in
things
that
they
ought
to
be
restrained
in
.
  
<EOS>
9
.
 
<EOS>
That
I
accustom
them
to
bear
disappointments
and
control
.
  
<EOS>
10
.
 
<EOS>
That
I
suffer
them
not
to
be
too
much
indulged
in
their
infancy
.
  
<EOS>
11
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
at
school
.
  
<EOS>
12
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
spoil
them
when
they
come
home
.
  
<EOS>
13
.
 
<EOS>
For
that
children
generally
extend
their
perverseness
from
the
nurse
to
the
schoolmaster
:
from
the
schoolmaster
to
the
parents
:
  
14
.
 
<EOS>
And
,
in
their
next
step
,
as
a
proper
punishment
for
all
,
make
their
ownselves
unhappy
.
  
<EOS>
15
.
 
<EOS>
That
undutiful
and
perverse
children
make
bad
husbands
and
wives
:
<EOS>
And
,
collaterally
,
bad
masters
and
mistresses
.
  
<EOS>
16
.
 
<EOS>
That
,
not
being
subject
to
be
controlled
early
,
they
can
not
,
when
married
,
bear
one
another
.
  
<EOS>
17
.
 
<EOS>
That
the
fault
lying
deep
,
and
in
the
minds
of
each
other
,
neither
will
mend
it
.
  
<EOS>
18
.
 
<EOS>
Whence
follow
misunderstandings
,
quarrels
,
appeals
,
ineffectual
reconciliations
,
separations
,
elopements
;
or
,
at
best
,
indifference
;
perhaps
,
aversion
.
 
<EOS>
Memorandum
;
A
good
image
of
unhappy
wedlock
,
in
the
words
YAWNING
HUSBAND
,
and
VAPOURISH
WIFE
,
when
together
:
But
separate
,
both
quite
alive
.
  
<EOS>
19
.
 
<EOS>
Few
married
persons
behave
as
he
likes
.
 
<EOS>
Let
me
ponder
this
with
awe
and
improvement
.
  
<EOS>
20
.
 
<EOS>
Some
gentlemen
can
compromise
with
their
wives
,
for
quietness
sake
;
but
he
ca
n't
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
I
believe
that
's
true
;
I
do
n't
desire
he
should
.
  
<EOS>
21
.
 
<EOS>
That
love
before
marriage
is
absolutely
necessary
.
  
<EOS>
22
.
 
<EOS>
That
there
are
fewer
instances
of
men
's
than
women
's
loving
better
after
marriage
.
 
<EOS>
But
why
so
?
 
<EOS>
I
wish
he
had
given
his
reasons
for
this
!
<EOS>
I
fancy
<EOS>
they
would
not
have
been
to
the
advantage
of
his
own
sex
.
  
<EOS>
23
.
 
<EOS>
That
a
woman
give
her
husband
reason
to
think
she
prefers
him
before
all
men
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
to
be
sure
this
should
be
so
.
  
<EOS>
24
.
 
<EOS>
That
if
she
would
overcome
,
it
must
be
by
sweetness
and
complaisance
;
that
is
,
by
yielding
,
he
means
,
no
doubt
.
  
<EOS>
25
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
not
such
a
slavish
one
neither
<EOS>
,
as
should
rather
seem
the
effect
of
her
insensibility
,
than
judgment
or
affection
.
  
<EOS>
26
.
 
<EOS>
That
the
words
COMMAND
and
OBEY
shall
be
blotted
out
of
the
Vocabulary
.
 
<EOS>
Very
good
!
  
<EOS>
27
.
 
<EOS>
That
a
man
should
desire
nothing
of
his
wife
,
but
what
is
significant
,
reasonable
,
just
.
 
<EOS>
To
be
sure
,
that
is
right
.
  
<EOS>
28
.
 
<EOS>
But
then
,
that
she
must
not
shew
reluctance
,
uneasiness
,
or
doubt
,
to
oblige
him
;
and
that
too
at
half
a
word
;
and
must
not
be
bid
twice
to
do
one
thing
.
 
<EOS>
But
may
not
there
be
some
occasions
,
where
this
may
be
a
little
dispensed
with
?
 
<EOS>
But
he
says
afterwards
,
indeed
,
  
29
.
 
<EOS>
That
this
must
be
only
while
he
took
care
to
make
her
compliance
reasonable
,
and
consistent
with
her
free
agency
,
in
points
that
ought
to
be
allowed
her
.
 
<EOS>
Come
,
this
is
pretty
well
,
considering
.
  
<EOS>
30
.
 
<EOS>
That
if
the
husband
be
set
upon
a
wrong
thing
,
she
must
not
dispute
with
him
,
but
do
it
and
,
expostulate
afterwards
.
 
<EOS>
Good
sirs
!
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
what
to
say
to
this
!
 
<EOS>
It
looks
a
little
hard
,
methinks
!
 
<EOS>
This
would
bear
a
smart
debate
,
I
fancy
,
in
a
parliament
of
women
.
 
<EOS>
But
then
he
says
,
  
31
.
 
<EOS>
Supposing
they
are
only
small
points
that
are
in
dispute
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
this
mends
it
a
little
.
 
<EOS>
For
small
points
,
I
think
,
should
not
be
stood
upon
.
  
<EOS>
32
.
 
<EOS>
That
the
greatest
quarrels
among
friends
(
and
wives
and
husbands
are
,
or
should
be
,
friends
)
arise
from
small
matters
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
this
is
very
true
;
for
I
had
like
to
have
had
anger
here
,
when
I
intended
very
well
.
  
<EOS>
33
.
 
<EOS>
That
a
wife
should
not
desire
to
convince
her
husband
for
CONTRADICTION
sake
,
but
for
HIS
OWN
.
 
<EOS>
As
both
will
find
their
account
in
this
,
if
one
does
,
I
believe
'
tis
very
just
.
  
<EOS>
34
.
 
<EOS>
That
in
all
companies
a
wife
must
shew
respect
and
love
to
her
husband
.
  
<EOS>
35
.
 
<EOS>
And
this
for
the
sake
of
her
own
reputation
and
security
;
for
,
  
36
.
 
<EOS>
That
rakes
can
not
have
a
greater
encouragement
to
attempt
a
married
lady
's
virtue
,
than
her
slight
opinion
of
her
husband
.
 
<EOS>
To
be
sure
this
stands
to
reason
,
and
is
a
fine
lesson
.
  
<EOS>
37
.
 
<EOS>
That
a
wife
should
therefore
draw
a
kind
veil
over
her
husband
's
faults
.
  
<EOS>
38
.
 
<EOS>
That
such
as
she
could
not
conceal
,
she
should
extenuate
.
  
<EOS>
39
.
 
<EOS>
That
his
virtues
<EOS>
she
should
place
in
an
advantageous
light
  
40
.
 
<EOS>
And
shew
the
world
,
that
he
had
HER
good
opinion
at
least
.
  
<EOS>
41
.
 
<EOS>
That
she
must
value
his
friends
for
his
sake
.
  
<EOS>
42
.
 
<EOS>
That
she
must
be
cheerful
and
easy
in
her
behaviour
,
to
whomsoever
he
brings
home
with
him
.
  
<EOS>
43
.
 
<EOS>
That
whatever
faults
she
sees
in
him
,
she
never
blame
him
before
company
.
  
<EOS>
44
.
 
<EOS>
At
least
,
with
such
an
air
of
superiority
,
as
if
she
had
a
less
opinion
of
his
judgment
than
her
own
.
  
<EOS>
45
.
 
<EOS>
That
a
man
of
nice
observation
can
not
be
contented
to
be
only
moderately
happy
in
a
wife
.
  
<EOS>
46
.
 
<EOS>
That
a
wife
take
care
<EOS>
how
she
ascribe
supererogatory
merit
to
herself
;
so
as
to
take
the
faults
of
others
upon
her
.
  
<EOS>
Indeed
,
I
think
it
is
well
if
we
can
bear
our
own
!
 
<EOS>
This
is
of
the
same
nature
with
the
third
;
and
touches
upon
me
,
on
the
present
occasion
,
for
this
wholesome
lecture
.
  
<EOS>
47
.
 
<EOS>
That
his
imperfections
must
not
be
a
plea
for
hers
.
 
<EOS>
To
be
sure
,
'
tis
<EOS>
no
matter
how
good
the
women
are
;
but
'
tis
to
be
hoped
men
will
allow
a
little
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
indeed
,
he
says
,
  
48
.
 
<EOS>
That
a
husband
,
who
expects
all
this
,
is
to
be
incapable
of
returning
insult
for
obligation
,
or
evil
for
good
;
and
ought
not
to
abridge
her
of
any
privilege
of
her
sex
.
  
<EOS>
Well
,
my
dear
parents
,
I
think
this
last
rule
crowns
the
rest
,
and
makes
them
all
very
tolerable
;
and
a
generous
man
,
and
a
man
of
sense
,
can
not
be
too
much
obliged
.
 
<EOS>
And
,
as
I
have
this
happiness
,
I
shall
be
very
unworthy
,
if
I
do
not
always
so
think
,
and
so
act
.
  
<EOS>
Yet
,
after
all
,
you
'll
see
I
have
not
the
easiest
task
in
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
know
my
own
intentions
,
that
I
shall
not
wilfully
err
;
and
so
fear
the
less
.
  
<EOS>
Not
one
hint
did
he
give
,
that
I
durst
lay
hold
of
,
about
poor
Miss
Sally
Godfrey
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
my
lady
had
not
spoken
of
it
:
for
it
has
given
me
a
curiosity
that
is
not
quite
so
pretty
in
me
;
especially
so
early
in
my
nuptials
,
and
in
a
case
so
long
ago
past
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
he
intimated
too
,
to
his
sister
,
that
he
had
had
other
faults
,
(
of
this
sort
,
I
suppose
,
)
that
had
not
come
to
her
knowledge
!
 
<EOS>
But
I
make
no
doubt
he
has
seen
his
error
,
and
will
be
very
good
for
the
future
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
it
,
and
pray
it
may
be
so
,
for
his
own
dear
sake
!
  
<EOS>
Wednesday
,
the
seventh
.
  
<EOS>
When
I
arose
in
the
morning
,
I
went
to
wait
on
Lady
Davers
,
seeing
her
door
open
;
and
she
was
in
bed
,
but
awake
,
and
talking
to
her
woman
.
 
<EOS>
I
said
,
<EOS>
I
hope
I
do
n't
disturb
your
ladyship
.
 
<EOS>
Not
at
all
,
said
she
;
<EOS>
I
am
glad
to
see
you
.
 
<EOS>
How
do
you
do
?
 
<EOS>
Well
,
added
she
,
when
do
you
set
out
for
Bedfordshire
?
 
<EOS>
I
said
,
I
ca
n't
tell
,
madam
;
it
was
designed
as
to
-
day
,
but
I
have
heard
no
more
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
Sit
down
,
said
she
,
on
the
bed
-
side
.
 
<EOS>
I
find
,
by
the
talk
we
had
yesterday
and
<EOS>
last
night
,
you
have
had
but
a
poor
time
of
it
,
Pamela
,
(
I
must
call
you
so
yet
,
said
she
,
)
since
you
were
brought
to
this
house
,
till
within
these
few
days
.
 
<EOS>
And
Mrs.
Jewkes
too
has
given
Beck
such
an
account
,
as
makes
me
pity
you
.
  
<EOS>
Indeed
,
madam
,
said
I
,
if
your
ladyship
knew
all
,
you
would
pity
me
;
for
never
poor
creature
was
so
hard
put
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
ought
to
forget
it
all
now
,
and
be
thankful
.
  
<EOS>
Why
,
said
she
,
as
far
as
I
can
find
,
'
tis
a
mercy
you
are
here
now
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
sadly
moved
with
some
part
of
your
story
and
you
have
really
made
a
noble
defence
,
and
deserve
the
praises
of
all
our
sex
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
God
enabled
me
,
madam
,
<EOS>
replied
<EOS>
I.
 
Why
,
said
she
,
'
tis
the
more
extraordinary
,
because
I
believe
,
if
the
truth
was
known
,
you
loved
the
wretch
not
a
little
.
 
<EOS>
While
my
trials
lasted
,
madam
,
said
I
,
I
had
not
a
thought
of
any
thing
,
but
to
preserve
my
innocence
,
much
less
of
love
.
  
<EOS>
But
,
tell
me
truly
,
said
she
,
did
you
not
love
him
all
the
time
?
 
<EOS>
I
had
always
,
madam
,
answered
I
,
a
great
reverence
for
my
master
,
and
thought
all
his
good
actions
doubly
good
and
for
his
naughty
ones
,
though
I
abhorred
his
attempts
upon
me
,
<EOS>
yet
I
could
not
hate
him
;
and
always
wished
him
well
;
but
I
did
not
know
that
it
was
love
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
I
had
not
the
presumption
.
  
<EOS>
Sweet
girl
!
<EOS>
said
she
;
<EOS>
that
's
prettily
said
:
<EOS>
But
when
he
found
he
could
not
gain
his
ends
,
and
began
to
be
sorry
for
your
sufferings
,
and
to
admire
your
virtue
,
and
to
profess
honourable
love
to
you
,
what
did
you
think
?
  
<EOS>
Think
!
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
madam
,
I
did
not
know
what
to
think
!
<EOS>
could
neither
hope
nor
believe
so
great
an
honour
would
fall
to
my
lot
,
and
feared
more
from
his
kindness
,
for
some
time
,
than
I
had
done
from
his
unkindness
:
<EOS>
And
,
having
had
a
private
intimation
,
from
a
kind
friend
,
of
a
sham
marriage
,
intended
by
means
of
a
man
who
was
to
personate
a
minister
,
it
kept
my
mind
in
too
much
suspense
,
to
be
greatly
overjoyed
at
his
kind
declaration
.
  
<EOS>
Said
she
<EOS>
,
I
think
he
did
make
two
or
three
attempts
upon
you
in
Bedfordshire
?
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
madam
,
said
I
;
he
was
very
naughty
,
to
be
sure
.
  
<EOS>
And
here
he
proposed
articles
to
you
,
I
understand
?
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
madam
,
replied
I
;
but
I
abhorred
so
much
the
thoughts
of
being
a
kept
creature
,
that
I
rejected
them
with
great
boldness
;
and
was
resolved
to
die
before
I
would
consent
to
them
.
  
<EOS>
He
afterwards
attempted
you
,
I
think
:
<EOS>
Did
he
not
?
 
<EOS>
O
yes
,
madam
,
said
I
,
a
most
sad
attempt
he
made
!
<EOS>
and
I
had
like
to
have
been
lost
;
for
Mrs.
Jewkes
was
not
so
good
as
she
should
have
been
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
I
told
her
ladyship
that
sad
affair
,
and
how
I
fell
into
fits
;
and
that
they
believing
me
dying
,
forbore
.
 
<EOS>
Any
attempts
after
this
base
one
?
<EOS>
she
said
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
not
so
good
<EOS>
as
he
should
have
been
,
returned
I
,
once
in
the
garden
,
afterwards
;
but
I
was
so
watchful
,
and
so
ready
to
take
the
alarm
!
  
<EOS>
But
,
said
she
,
did
he
not
threaten
you
,
at
times
,
and
put
on
his
stern
airs
,
every
now
and
then
?
 
<EOS>
Threaten
,
madam
,
replied
I
;
yes
,
I
had
enough
of
that
!
 
<EOS>
I
thought
I
should
have
died
for
fear
several
times
.
 
<EOS>
How
could
you
bear
that
?
<EOS>
said
she
:
for
he
is
a
most
daring
and
majestic
mortal
!
 
<EOS>
He
has
none
of
your
puny
hearts
,
but
is
as
courageous
as
a
lion
;
and
,
boy
and
man
,
never
feared
any
thing
.
 
<EOS>
I
myself
,
said
she
,
have
a
pretty
good
spirit
;
<EOS>
but
,
when
I
have
made
him
truly
angry
,
I
have
always
been
forced
to
make
it
up
with
him
,
as
well
as
I
could
:
for
,
child
,
he
is
not
one
that
is
easily
reconciled
,
I
assure
you
.
  
<EOS>
But
,
after
he
had
professed
honourable
love
to
you
,
did
he
never
attempt
you
again
?
 
<EOS>
No
,
indeed
,
madam
,
he
did
not
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
was
a
good
while
struggling
with
himself
,
and
with
his
pride
,
as
he
was
pleased
to
call
it
,
before
he
could
stoop
so
low
;
and
considered
,
and
considered
again
:
and
once
,
upon
my
saying
but
two
or
three
words
,
that
displeased
him
,
when
he
was
very
kind
to
me
,
he
turned
me
out
of
doors
,
in
a
manner
,
at
an
hour
's
warning
;
for
he
sent
me
above
a
day
's
journey
towards
my
father
's
;
and
then
sent
a
man
and
horse
,
post
-
haste
,
to
fetch
me
back
again
;
and
has
been
exceedingly
kind
and
gracious
to
me
ever
since
,
and
made
me
happy
.
  
<EOS>
That
sending
you
away
,
said
she
,
one
hour
,
and
sending
after
you
the
next
,
is
exactly
like
my
brother
;
and
'
tis
<EOS>
well
if
he
do
n't
turn
you
off
twice
or
thrice
before
a
year
comes
about
,
if
you
vex
him
:
and
he
would
have
done
the
same
by
the
first
lady
in
the
land
,
if
he
had
been
married
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
has
he
his
virtues
,
as
well
as
his
faults
;
for
he
is
generous
;
nay
,
he
is
noble
in
his
spirit
;
hates
little
dirty
actions
:
he
delights
in
doing
good
;
but
does
not
pass
over
a
wilful
fault
easily
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
wise
,
prudent
,
sober
,
and
magnanimous
,
and
will
not
tell
a
lie
,
nor
disguise
his
faults
;
but
you
must
not
expect
to
have
him
all
to
yourself
,
I
doubt
.
  
<EOS>
But
I
'll
no
more
harp
upon
this
string
:
<EOS>
You
see
how
he
was
exasperated
at
me
;
and
he
seemed
to
be
angry
at
you
too
;
though
something
of
it
was
art
,
I
believe
.
  
<EOS>
Indeed
,
madam
,
said
I
,
he
has
been
pleased
to
give
me
a
most
noble
lecture
;
and
I
find
he
was
angry
with
me
in
earnest
,
and
that
it
will
not
be
an
easy
task
to
behave
unexceptionably
to
him
:
for
he
is
very
nice
and
delicate
in
his
notions
,
I
perceive
;
but
<EOS>
yet
,
as
your
ladyship
says
,
exceeding
generous
.
  
<EOS>
Well
,
said
she
,
I
'm
glad
thou
hadst
a
little
bit
of
his
anger
;
else
I
should
have
thought
it
art
;
and
I
do
n't
love
to
be
treated
with
low
art
,
any
more
than
he
;
and
I
should
have
been
vexed
if
he
had
done
it
by
me
.
  
<EOS>
But
I
understand
,
child
,
said
she
,
that
you
keep
a
journal
of
all
matters
that
pass
,
and
he
has
several
times
found
means
to
get
at
it
:
<EOS>
Should
you
care
I
should
see
it
?
 
<EOS>
It
could
not
be
to
your
disadvantage
;
for
I
find
it
had
no
small
weight
with
him
in
your
favour
;
and
I
should
take
great
pleasure
to
read
all
his
stratagems
,
attempts
,
contrivances
,
menaces
,
and
offers
to
you
,
on
one
hand
,
and
all
your
pretty
counter
-
plottings
,
which
he
much
praises
;
your
resolute
resistance
,
and
the
noble
stand
you
have
made
to
preserve
your
virtue
;
and
the
steps
by
which
his
pride
was
subdued
,
and
his
mind
induced
to
honourable
love
,
till
you
were
made
what
you
now
are
:
<EOS>
for
it
must
be
a
rare
and
uncommon
story
;
and
will
not
only
give
me
great
pleasure
in
reading
,
but
will
entirely
reconcile
me
to
the
step
he
has
taken
:
and
that
,
let
me
tell
you
,
is
what
I
never
thought
to
be
;
for
I
had
gone
a
great
way
in
bringing
about
a
match
with
him
and
Lady
Betty
;
and
had
said
so
much
of
it
,
that
the
earl
,
her
father
,
approved
of
it
:
and
so
did
the
Duke
of
#
#
#
#
,
 
her
uncle
;
and
Lady
Betty
herself
was
not
averse
:
and
now
I
shall
be
hunted
to
death
about
it
;
and
this
has
made
me
so
outrageous
as
you
have
seen
me
upon
the
matter
.
 
<EOS>
But
when
I
can
find
,
by
your
writings
,
that
your
virtue
is
but
suitably
rewarded
,
it
will
be
not
only
a
good
excuse
for
me
,
but
for
him
,
and
make
me
love
you
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
nothing
that
I
would
not
do
,
said
I
,
to
oblige
your
ladyship
;
but
my
poor
father
and
mother
(
who
would
rather
have
seen
me
buried
quick
in
the
earth
,
than
to
be
seduced
by
the
greatest
of
princes
)
<EOS>
have
them
in
their
hands
at
present
;
and
your
dear
brother
has
bespoken
them
,
when
they
have
done
reading
them
:
<EOS>
but
,
if
he
gives
me
leave
,
I
will
shew
them
to
your
ladyship
,
with
all
my
heart
;
not
doubting
your
generous
allowances
,
as
I
have
had
his
;
though
I
have
treated
him
very
freely
all
the
way
,
while
he
had
naughty
views
;
and
that
your
ladyship
would
consider
them
as
the
naked
sentiments
of
my
heart
,
from
time
to
time
delivered
to
those
,
whose
indulgence
I
was
sure
of
;
and
for
whose
sight
only
they
were
written
.
  
<EOS>
Give
me
a
kiss
now
,
said
her
ladyship
,
for
your
cheerful
compliance
:
<EOS>
for
I
make
no
doubt
my
brother
will
consent
<EOS>
I
shall
see
them
,
because
they
must
needs
make
for
your
honour
;
and
I
see
he
loves
you
better
than
any
one
in
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
heard
,
continued
her
ladyship
,
a
mighty
good
character
of
your
parents
,
as
industrious
,
honest
,
sensible
,
good
folks
,
who
know
the
world
;
and
,
as
I
doubt
not
my
brother
's
generosity
,
I
am
glad
they
will
make
no
ill
figure
in
the
world
's
eye
.
  
<EOS>
Madam
,
said
I
,
they
are
the
honestest
,
the
lovingest
,
and
the
most
conscientious
couple
breathing
.
 
<EOS>
They
once
lived
creditably
;
and
brought
up
a
great
family
,
of
which
I
am
the
youngest
;
but
had
misfortunes
,
through
their
doing
beyond
their
power
for
two
unhappy
brothers
,
who
are
both
dead
,
and
whose
debts
they
stood
bound
for
;
and
so
became
reduced
,
and
,
by
harsh
creditors
,
(
where
most
of
the
debts
were
,
not
of
their
own
contracting
,
)
<EOS>
turned
out
of
all
;
and
having
,
without
success
,
tried
to
set
up
a
little
country
-
school
;
(
for
my
father
understood
a
little
of
accounts
,
and
wrote
a
pretty
good
hand
;
)
forced
to
take
to
hard
labour
;
but
honest
all
the
time
;
contented
;
never
repining
;
and
loving
to
one
another
;
and
,
in
the
midst
of
their
poverty
and
disappointments
,
above
all
temptation
;
and
all
their
fear
was
,
that
I
should
be
wicked
,
and
yield
to
temptation
for
the
sake
of
worldly
riches
and
to
God
's
grace
,
and
their
good
lessons
,
and
those
I
imbibed
from
my
dear
good
lady
,
your
ladyship
's
mother
<EOS>
,
it
is
that
I
owe
the
preservation
of
my
innocence
,
  
and
the
happy
station
I
am
exalted
to
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
pleased
to
kiss
me
again
,
and
said
,
There
is
such
a
noble
simplicity
in
thy
story
,
such
an
honest
artlessness
in
thy
mind
,
and
such
a
sweet
humility
in
thy
deportment
,
notwithstanding
thy
present
station
,
that
I
believe
I
shall
be
forced
to
love
thee
,
whether
I
will
or
not
:
and
the
sight
of
your
papers
,
I
dare
say
,
will
crown
the
work
;
will
disarm
my
pride
,
banish
my
resentment
on
Lady
Betty
's
account
,
and
justify
my
brother
's
conduct
;
and
,
at
the
same
time
,
redound
to
your
own
everlasting
honour
,
as
well
as
to
the
credit
of
our
sex
:
<EOS>
and
so
I
make
no
doubt
<EOS>
but
my
brother
will
let
me
see
them
.
  
<EOS>
Worden
,
said
my
lady
,
I
can
say
any
thing
before
you
;
and
you
will
take
no
notice
of
our
conversation
;
but
I
see
you
are
much
touched
with
it
:
<EOS>
Did
you
ever
hear
any
thing
prettier
,
more
unaffected
,
sincere
,
free
,
easy
?
 
<EOS>
No
,
never
,
madam
,
answered
she
,
in
my
life
;
and
it
is
a
great
pleasure
to
see
so
happy
a
reconciliation
taking
place
,
where
there
is
so
much
merit
.
  
<EOS>
I
said
,
I
have
discovered
so
much
prudence
in
Mrs.
Worden
,
that
,
as
well
for
that
,
as
for
the
confidence
your
ladyship
places
in
her
,
I
have
made
no
scruple
of
speaking
my
mind
freely
before
her
;
and
of
blaming
my
dear
master
while
he
was
blameworthy
,
as
well
as
acknowledging
his
transcendent
goodness
to
me
since
;
which
,
I
am
sure
,
exceeds
all
I
can
ever
deserve
.
 
<EOS>
May
be
not
<EOS>
,
said
my
lady
;
I
hope
you
'll
be
very
happy
in
one
another
;
and
I
'll
now
rise
,
and
tell
him
my
thoughts
,
and
ask
him
to
let
me
have
the
reading
of
your
papers
;
for
I
promise
myself
much
pleasure
in
them
;
and
shall
not
grudge
a
journey
and
a
visit
to
you
,
to
the
other
house
,
to
fetch
them
.
  
<EOS>
Your
ladyship
's
favour
,
said
I
,
was
all
I
had
to
wish
for
;
and
if
I
have
that
,
and
the
continuance
of
your
dear
brother
's
goodness
to
me
,
I
shall
be
easy
under
whatever
else
may
happen
.
  
<EOS>
And
so
I
took
my
leave
,
and
withdrew
;
and
she
let
me
hear
her
say
to
Mrs.
Worden
,
'
Tis
a
charming
creature
,
Worden
!
 
<EOS>
I
know
not
which
excels
;
her
person
,
or
her
mind
!
 
<EOS>
And
so
young
a
creature
too
!
 
<EOS>
Well
may
my
brother
love
her
!
  
<EOS>
I
am
afraid
,
my
dear
father
and
mother
,
I
shall
now
be
too
proud
indeed
.
  
<EOS>
I
had
once
a
good
mind
to
have
asked
her
ladyship
about
Miss
Sally
Godfrey
;
but
I
thought
it
was
better
let
alone
,
since
she
did
not
mention
It
herself
.
 
<EOS>
May
be
<EOS>
I
shall
hear
it
too
soon
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
hope
not
.
 
<EOS>
I
wonder
,
though
,
whether
she
be
living
or
dead
.
  
<EOS>
We
breakfasted
together
with
great
good
temper
;
and
my
lady
was
very
kind
,
and
,
asking
my
good
master
,
he
gave
leave
very
readily
,
she
should
see
all
my
papers
,
when
you
returned
them
to
me
;
and
he
said
,
He
was
sure
,
when
she
came
to
read
them
,
she
would
say
,
that
I
had
well
deserved
the
fortune
I
had
met
with
:
and
would
be
of
opinion
,
that
all
the
kindness
of
his
future
life
would
hardly
be
a
sufficient
reward
for
my
virtue
,
and
make
me
amends
for
my
sufferings
.
  
<EOS>
My
lady
resolving
to
set
out
the
next
morning
to
return
to
her
lord
,
my
master
ordered
every
thing
to
be
made
ready
for
his
doing
the
like
to
Bedfordshire
;
and
this
evening
our
good
neighbours
will
sup
with
us
,
to
take
leave
of
my
lady
and
us
.
  
<EOS>
Wednesday
night
.
  
<EOS>
Nothing
particular
having
passed
at
dinner
or
supper
,
but
the
most
condescending
goodness
,
on
my
lady
's
side
,
to
me
;
and
the
highest
civilities
from
Mr.
Peters
's
family
,
from
Lady
Jones
,
from
Sir
Simon
's
family
,
etc
.
<EOS>
and
reciprocal
good
wishes
all
around
;
and
a
promise
obtained
from
my
benefactor
,
that
he
would
endeavour
to
pass
a
fortnight
or
three
weeks
in
these
parts
,
before
the
winter
set
in
;
I
shall
conclude
this
day
with
observing
,
that
I
disposed
of
the
money
my
master
was
so
good
to
put
into
my
hands
,
in
the
manner
he
was
pleased
to
direct
;
and
I
gave
Mrs.
Jewkes
hers
in
such
a
manner
as
highly
pleased
her
;
and
she
wished
me
,
with
tears
,
all
kinds
of
happiness
;
and
prayed
me
to
forgive
her
all
her
wickedness
to
me
,
as
she
herself
called
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
begged
leave
of
my
master
to
present
Mrs.
Worden
with
five
guineas
for
a
pair
of
gloves
;
<EOS>
which
he
said
was
well
thought
of
.
  
<EOS>
I
should
have
mentioned
,
that
Miss
Darnford
and
<EOS>
I
agreed
upon
a
correspondence
,
which
will
be
no
small
pleasure
to
me
;
for
she
is
an
admirable
young
lady
,
whom
I
prefer
to
every
one
I
have
seen
;
and
I
shall
<EOS>
,
I
make
no
doubt
,
improve
by
her
letters
;
for
she
is
said
to
have
a
happy
talent
in
writing
,
and
is
well
read
,
for
so
young
a
lady
.
  
<EOS>
Saturday
.
  
<EOS>
On
Thursday
morning
my
lady
set
out
for
her
own
seat
;
and
my
best
friend
and
I
,
attended
by
Mr.
Colbrand
,
Abraham
,
and
Thomas
,
for
this
dear
house
.
 
<EOS>
Her
ladyship
parted
with
her
brother
and
me
with
great
tenderness
,
and
made
me
promise
to
send
her
my
papers
;
which
I
find
she
intends
to
entertain
Lady
Betty
with
,
and
another
lady
or
two
,
her
intimates
,
as
also
her
lord
;
and
hopes
to
find
,
as
I
believe
,
in
the
reading
of
them
,
some
excuse
for
her
brother
's
choice
.
  
<EOS>
My
dearest
master
has
been
all
love
and
tenderness
on
the
road
,
as
he
is
in
every
place
,
and
on
every
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
And
oh
,
what
a
delightful
change
was
this
journey
,
to
that
which
,
so
contrary
to
all
my
wishes
,
and
so
much
to
my
apprehensions
,
carried
me
hence
to
the
Lincolnshire
house
!
<EOS>
And
how
did
I
bless
God
at
every
turn
,
and
at
every
stage
!
  
<EOS>
We
did
not
arrive
here
till
yesterday
noon
.
 
<EOS>
Abraham
rode
before
,
to
let
them
know
we
were
coming
:
and
I
had
the
satisfaction
to
find
every
body
there
I
wished
to
see
.
  
<EOS>
When
the
chariot
entered
the
court
-
yard
,
I
was
so
strongly
impressed
with
the
favour
and
mercies
of
God
Almighty
,
on
remembering
how
I
was
sent
away
the
last
time
I
saw
this
house
;
the
leave
I
took
;
the
dangers
I
had
encountered
;
a
poor
cast
-
off
servant
girl
;
and
now
returning
a
joyful
wife
,
and
the
mistress
,
through
his
favour
,
of
the
noble
house
I
was
turned
out
of
;
that
I
was
hardly
able
to
support
the
joy
I
felt
in
my
mind
on
the
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
He
saw
how
much
I
was
moved
,
and
tenderly
asked
me
,
Why
I
seemed
so
affected
?
 
<EOS>
I
told
him
,
and
lifted
his
dear
hand
to
my
lips
,
and
said
,
O
sir
!
<EOS>
God
's
mercies
,
and
your
goodness
to
me
on
entering
this
dear
,
dear
place
,
are
above
my
expression
;
I
can
hardly
bear
the
thoughts
of
them
!
 
<EOS>
He
said
,
Welcome
,
thrice
welcome
,
joy
of
my
life
!
<EOS>
to
your
own
house
;
and
kissed
my
hand
in
return
.
 
<EOS>
All
the
common
servants
stood
at
the
windows
,
as
unseen
as
they
could
,
to
observe
us
.
 
<EOS>
He
took
my
hand
,
with
the
most
condescending
goodness
in
the
world
;
and
,
with
great
complaisance
,
led
me
into
the
parlour
,
and
kissed
me
with
the
greatest
ardour
.
 
<EOS>
Welcome
again
,
my
dearest
life
!
<EOS>
said
he
,
a
thousand
times
welcome
to
the
possession
of
a
house
that
is
not
more
mine
than
yours
!
  
<EOS>
I
threw
myself
at
his
feet
:
<EOS>
Permit
me
,
dear
sir
,
thus
to
bless
God
,
and
thank
you
,
for
all
his
mercies
and
your
goodness
.
 
<EOS>
O
may
I
so
behave
,
as
not
to
be
utterly
unworthy
;
and
then
how
happy
shall
I
be
!
 
<EOS>
God
give
me
,
my
dearest
,
said
he
,
life
and
health
to
reward
all
your
sweetness
!
<EOS>
and
no
man
can
be
so
blest
as
I.
  
<EOS>
Where
(
said
he
to
Abraham
,
who
passed
by
the
door
)
,
where
is
Mrs.
Jervis
?
 
<EOS>
She
bolted
in
:
<EOS>
Here
,
good
sir
!
<EOS>
said
she
;
<EOS>
here
,
good
madam
!
<EOS>
am
I
,
waiting
impatiently
,
till
called
for
,
to
congratulate
you
both
.
 
<EOS>
I
ran
to
her
,
and
clasped
my
arms
about
her
neck
,
and
kissed
her
;
O
my
dear
Mrs.
Jervis
!
<EOS>
said
I
,
my
other
dear
mother
!
<EOS>
receive
your
happy
,
happy
Pamela
;
and
join
with
me
to
bless
God
,
and
bless
our
master
,
for
all
these
great
things
!
 
<EOS>
I
was
ready
to
sink
in
her
arms
through
excess
of
joy
,
to
see
the
dear
good
woman
,
who
had
been
so
often
a
mournful
witness
of
my
distress
,
as
now
of
my
triumph
.
 
<EOS>
Dearest
madam
,
said
she
,
you
do
me
too
much
honour
.
 
<EOS>
Let
my
whole
life
shew
<EOS>
the
joy
I
take
in
your
deserved
good
fortune
,
and
in
my
duty
to
you
,
for
the
early
instance
I
received
of
your
goodness
in
your
kind
letter
.
 
<EOS>
O
Mrs.
Jervis
!
<EOS>
replied
I
,
there
all
thanks
are
due
,
both
from
you
and
me
:
for
our
dear
master
granted
me
this
blessing
,
as
I
may
justly
call
it
,
the
very
first
moment
I
begged
it
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
Your
goodness
,
sir
,
said
she
,
I
will
for
ever
acknowledge
;
and
I
beg
pardon
for
the
wrong
step
I
made
in
applying
to
my
Lady
Davers
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
so
good
as
to
salute
her
,
and
said
,
All
is
over
now
,
Mrs.
Jervis
;
and
I
shall
not
remember
you
ever
disobliged
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
always
respected
you
,
and
shall
now
more
and
more
value
you
,
for
the
sake
of
that
dear
good
creature
,
whom
,
with
joy
unfeigned
,
I
can
call
my
wife
.
 
<EOS>
God
bless
your
honour
for
ever
!
<EOS>
said
she
;
and
many
many
happy
years
may
ye
live
together
,
the
envy
and
wonder
of
all
who
know
you
!
  
<EOS>
But
where
,
said
my
dear
master
,
is
honest
Longman
?
<EOS>
and
where
is
Jonathan
?
 
<EOS>
Come
,
Mrs.
Jervis
,
said
I
<EOS>
,
you
shall
shew
me
them
,
and
<EOS>
all
the
good
folks
,
presently
;
and
let
me
go
up
with
you
to
behold
the
dear
apartments
,
which
I
have
seen
before
with
such
different
emotions
to
what
I
shall
now
do
.
  
<EOS>
We
went
up
;
and
in
every
room
,
the
chamber
I
took
refuge
in
,
when
my
master
pursued
me
,
my
lady
's
chamber
,
her
dressing
-
room
,
Mrs.
Jervis
's
room
,
not
forgetting
her
closet
,
my
own
little
bed
-
chamber
,
the
green
-
room
,
and
in
each
of
the
others
,
I
blessed
God
for
my
past
escapes
,
and
present
happiness
;
and
the
good
woman
was
quite
affected
with
the
zeal
and
pleasure
with
which
I
made
my
thankful
acknowledgments
to
the
divine
goodness
.
 
<EOS>
O
my
excellent
lady
!
<EOS>
said
she
,
you
are
still
the
same
good
,
pious
,
humble
soul
I
knew
you
;
and
your
marriage
has
added
to
your
graces
,
as
I
hope
it
will
to
your
blessings
.
  
<EOS>
Dear
Mrs.
Jervis
,
said
I
,
you
know
not
what
I
have
gone
through
!
 
<EOS>
You
know
not
what
God
has
done
for
me
!
 
<EOS>
You
know
not
what
a
happy
creature
I
am
now
!
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
thousand
thousand
things
to
tell
you
;
and
a
whole
week
will
be
too
little
,
every
moment
of
it
spent
in
relating
to
you
what
has
befallen
me
,
to
make
you
acquainted
with
it
all
.
 
<EOS>
We
shall
be
sweetly
happy
together
<EOS>
,
I
make
no
doubt
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
charge
you
,
my
dear
Mrs.
Jervis
,
whatever
you
call
me
before
strangers
,
that
when
we
are
by
ourselves
you
call
me
nothing
but
your
Pamela
.
 
<EOS>
For
what
an
ungrateful
creature
should
I
be
,
who
have
received
so
many
mercies
,
if
I
attributed
them
not
to
the
divine
goodness
,
but
assumed
to
myself
insolent
airs
upon
them
!
 
<EOS>
No
,
I
hope
I
shall
be
,
more
and
more
thankful
,
as
I
am
more
and
more
blest
!
<EOS>
and
more
humble
,
as
God
,
the
author
of
all
my
happiness
,
shall
more
distinguish
me
.
  
<EOS>
We
went
down
again
to
the
parlour
,
to
my
dear
master
.
 
<EOS>
Said
he
,
Call
Longman
in
again
;
he
longs
to
see
you
,
my
dear
.
 
<EOS>
He
came
in
:
<EOS>
God
bless
you
,
my
sweet
lady
,
said
he
;
as
now
,
Heaven
be
praised
,
I
may
call
you
!
<EOS>
Did
I
not
tell
you
,
madam
,
that
Providence
would
find
you
out
?
 
<EOS>
O
,
Mr.
Longman
,
said
I
,
God
be
praised
for
all
his
mercies
!
 
<EOS>
I
am
rejoiced
to
see
you
;
and
I
laid
my
hand
on
his
,
and
said
,
Good
Mr.
Longman
,
how
do
you
do
?
 
<EOS>
I
must
always
value
you
;
and
you
do
n't
know
how
much
of
my
present
happiness
I
owe
to
the
sheets
of
paper
,
and
pens
and
ink
,
you
furnished
me
with
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
my
dear
sir
<EOS>
and
you
are
quite
reconciled
.
 
<EOS>
O
,
madam
,
said
he
,
how
good
you
are
!
 
<EOS>
Why
,
I
can
not
contain
myself
for
joy
!
<EOS>
and
then
he
wiped
his
eyes
;
good
man
!
  
<EOS>
Said
my
master
,
Yes
,
I
have
been
telling
Longman
that
I
am
obliged
to
him
for
his
ready
return
to
me
;
and
that
I
will
entirely
forget
his
appeal
to
Lady
Davers
;
and
I
hope
he
'll
find
himself
quite
as
easy
and
happy
as
he
wishes
.
 
<EOS>
My
dear
partner
here
,
Mr.
Longman
<EOS>
,
I
dare
promise
you
,
will
do
all
she
can
to
make
you
so
.
 
<EOS>
Heaven
bless
you
both
together
!
<EOS>
said
he
.
'
<EOS>
Tis
the
pride
of
my
heart
to
see
this
!
 
<EOS>
I
returned
with
double
delight
,
when
I
heard
the
blessed
news
;
and
I
am
sure
,
sir
,
said
he
,
(
mark
old
Longman
's
words
,
)
<EOS>
God
will
bless
you
for
this
every
year
more
and
more
!
<EOS>
You
do
n't
know
how
many
hearts
you
have
made
happy
by
this
generous
deed
!
 
<EOS>
I
am
glad
of
it
,
said
my
dear
master
;
I
am
sure
I
have
made
my
own
happy
:
and
,
Longman
,
though
I
must
think
you
SOMEBODY
,
yet
,
as
you
are
not
a
young
man
,
and
so
wo
n't
make
me
jealous
<EOS>
,
I
can
allow
you
to
wish
my
dear
wife
joy
in
the
tenderest
manner
.
 
<EOS>
Adad
!
<EOS>
sir
,
said
he
,
I
am
sure
you
rejoice
me
with
your
favour
:
'
<EOS>
Tis
what
I
longed
for
,
but
durst
not
presume
.
 
<EOS>
My
dear
,
said
my
master
,
receive
the
compliment
of
one
of
the
honestest
hearts
in
England
,
that
always
revered
your
virtues
!
 
<EOS>
and
the
good
man
saluted
me
with
great
respect
,
and
said
,
God
in
Heaven
bless
you
both
!
<EOS>
and
kneeled
on
one
knee
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
quit
your
presence
!
 
<EOS>
Indeed
I
must
!
 
<EOS>
And
away
he
went
.
  
<EOS>
Your
goodness
,
sir
,
said
I
,
knows
no
bounds
:
O
may
my
gratitude
never
find
any
!
 
<EOS>
I
saw
,
said
my
master
,
when
the
good
man
approached
you
,
that
he
did
it
with
so
much
awe
and
love
mingled
together
,
that
I
fancied
he
longed
to
salute
my
angel
;
and
I
could
not
but
indulge
his
honest
heart
.
<EOS>
How
blessed
am
I
!
<EOS>
said
I
,
and
kissed
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
And
indeed
I
make
nothing
now
of
kissing
his
dear
hand
,
as
if
it
was
my
own
!
  
<EOS>
When
honest
old
Mr.
Jonathan
come
in
to
attend
at
dinner
,
so
clean
,
so
sleek
,
and
so
neat
,
as
he
always
is
,
with
his
silver
hair
,
I
said
,
Well
,
Mr.
Jonathan
,
how
do
you
do
?
 
<EOS>
I
am
glad
to
see
you
.
 
<EOS>
You
look
as
well
as
ever
,
thank
God
!
 
<EOS>
O
,
dear
madam
!
<EOS>
said
he
,
better
than
ever
,
to
have
such
a
blessed
sight
!
 
<EOS>
God
bless
you
and
my
good
master
!
 
<EOS>
and
I
hope
,
sir
<EOS>
,
said
he
,
you
'll
excuse
all
my
past
failings
.
 
<EOS>
Ay
,
that
I
will
,
Jonathan
,
said
he
;
because
you
never
had
any
,
but
what
your
regard
for
my
dear
wife
here
was
the
occasion
of
.
 
<EOS>
And
now
I
can
tell
you
,
you
can
never
err
,
because
you
can
not
respect
her
too
much
.
 
<EOS>
O
sir
,
said
he
,
your
honour
is
exceeding
good
!
 
<EOS>
I
'm
sure
I
shall
always
pray
for
you
both
.
  
<EOS>
After
dinner
,
Mr.
Longman
coming
in
,
and
talking
of
some
affairs
under
his
care
,
he
said
afterwards
,
All
your
honour
's
servants
are
now
happy
;
for
Robert
,
who
left
you
,
had
a
pretty
little
fortune
fallen
to
him
,
or
he
never
would
have
quitted
your
service
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
here
but
yesterday
,
to
inquire
when
you
and
my
lady
returned
hither
;
and
hoped
he
might
have
leave
to
pay
his
duty
to
you
both
.
 
<EOS>
Ay
,
said
my
master
,
I
shall
be
glad
to
see
honest
Robert
;
for
that
's
another
of
your
favourites
,
Pamela
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
high
time
<EOS>
,
I
think
,
I
should
marry
you
,
were
it
but
to
engage
the
respects
of
all
my
family
to
myself
.
 
<EOS>
There
are
,
sir
,
said
I
,
ten
thousand
reasons
why
I
should
rejoice
in
your
goodness
.
  
<EOS>
But
I
was
going
to
say
,
said
Mr.
Longman
,
That
all
your
honour
's
old
servants
are
now
happy
,
but
one
.
 
<EOS>
You
mean
John
Arnold
?
<EOS>
said
my
master
.
<EOS>
I
do
,
indeed
,
said
he
,
if
you
'll
excuse
me
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
O
,
said
I
,
I
have
had
my
prayer
for
poor
John
answered
,
as
favourably
as
I
could
wish
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
said
Mr.
Longman
,
to
be
sure
poor
<EOS>
John
has
acted
no
very
good
part
,
take
it
altogether
;
but
he
so
much
honoured
you
,
sir
,
and
so
much
respected
you
,
madam
,
that
he
would
have
been
glad
to
have
been
obedient
to
both
;
and
so
was
faithful
to
neither
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
indeed
,
the
poor
fellow
's
heart
is
almost
broke
,
and
he
wo
n't
look
out
for
any
other
place
;
and
says
,
he
must
live
in
your
honour
's
service
,
or
he
must
die
wretched
very
shortly
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jervis
was
there
when
this
was
said
:
Indeed
,
said
she
,
the
poor
man
has
been
here
every
day
since
he
heard
the
tidings
,
that
have
rejoiced
us
all
;
and
he
says
,
he
hopes
he
shall
yet
be
forgiven
.
 
<EOS>
Is
he
in
the
house
now
?
<EOS>
said
my
master
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
,
sir
;
and
was
here
when
your
honour
came
in
,
and
played
at
hide
and
seek
to
have
one
look
at
you
both
when
you
alighted
;
and
was
ready
to
go
out
of
his
wits
for
joy
,
when
we
saw
your
honour
hand
my
lady
in
.
 
<EOS>
Pamela
,
said
my
dear
master
,
you
're
to
do
with
John
as
you
please
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
full
power
.
 
<EOS>
Then
pray
,
sir
<EOS>
,
said
I
,
let
poor
John
come
in
.
  
<EOS>
The
poor
fellow
came
in
,
with
so
much
confusion
,
that
I
have
never
seen
a
countenance
that
expressed
so
lively
a
consciousness
of
his
faults
,
and
mingled
joy
and
shame
.
 
<EOS>
How
do
you
do
,
John
?
<EOS>
said
I
<EOS>
;
I
hope
you
are
very
well
!
 
<EOS>
The
poor
fellow
could
hardly
speak
,
and
looked
with
awe
upon
my
master
,
and
pleasure
upon
me
.
 
<EOS>
Said
my
master
,
<EOS>
Well
,
John
,
there
is
no
room
to
say
any
thing
to
a
man
that
has
so
much
concern
already
:
I
am
told
you
will
serve
me
whether
I
will
or
not
;
but
I
turn
you
over
altogether
to
my
spouse
here
:
and
she
is
to
do
by
you
as
she
pleases
.
<EOS>
You
see
,
John
,
said
I
,
your
good
master
's
indulgence
.
 
<EOS>
Well
may
I
forgive
,
<EOS>
that
have
so
generous
an
example
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
always
persuaded
of
your
honest
intentions
,
if
you
had
known
how
to
distinguish
between
your
duty
to
your
master
,
and
your
good
-
will
to
me
:
You
will
now
have
no
more
puzzles
on
that
account
,
from
the
goodness
of
your
dear
master
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
be
<EOS>
but
too
happy
<EOS>
I
said
the
poor
man
.
 
<EOS>
God
bless
your
honour
!
 
<EOS>
God
bless
you
,
madam
!
 
<EOS>
I
now
have
the
joy
of
my
soul
,
in
serving
you
both
;
and
I
will
make
the
best
of
servants
,
to
my
power
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
then
,
John
,
said
I
,
your
wages
will
go
on
,
as
if
you
had
not
left
your
master
:
<EOS>
May
I
not
say
so
,
sir
?
<EOS>
said
I.
 
Yes
,
surely
,
my
dear
,
replied
he
;
and
augment
them
too
,
if
you
find
his
duty
to
you
deserves
it
.
 
<EOS>
A
thousand
millions
of
thanks
,
said
the
poor
man
<EOS>
:
I
am
very
well
satisfied
,
and
desire
no
augmentation
.
<EOS>
And
so
he
withdrew
,
overjoyed
;
and
Mrs.
Jervis
and
Mr.
Longman
were
highly
pleased
;
for
though
they
were
incensed
against
him
for
his
fault
to
me
,
when
matters
looked
badly
for
me
,
yet
they
,
and
all
his
fellow
-
servants
,
always
loved
John
.
  
<EOS>
When
Mr.
Longman
and
Mrs.
Jervis
had
dined
,
they
came
in
again
,
to
know
if
he
had
any
commands
;
and
my
dear
master
,
filling
a
glass
of
wine
,
said
,
Longman
,
I
am
going
to
toast
the
happiest
and
honestest
couple
in
England
,
my
dear
Pamela
's
father
and
mother
.
 
<EOS>
Thank
you
,
dear
sir
,
said
I.
  
I
think
,
continued
he
,
that
little
Kentish
purchase
wants
a
manager
;
and
as
it
is
a
little
out
of
your
way
,
Longman
,
I
have
been
purposing
,
if
I
thought
Mr.
Andrews
would
accept
it
,
that
he
should
enter
upon
Hodge
's
farm
that
was
,
and
so
manage
for
me
that
whole
little
affair
;
and
we
will
well
stock
the
farm
for
him
,
and
make
it
comfortable
;
and
I
think
,
if
he
will
take
that
trouble
upon
him
,
it
will
be
an
ease
to
you
,
and
a
favour
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
Your
honour
,
said
he
,
can
not
do
a
better
thing
;
and
I
have
had
some
inkling
given
me
,
that
you
may
,
if
you
please
,
augment
that
estate
,
by
a
purchase
,
of
equal
amount
,
contiguous
to
it
;
and
as
you
have
so
much
money
to
spare
,
I
ca
n't
see
your
honour
can
do
better
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
said
he
,
let
me
have
the
particulars
another
time
,
and
we
will
consider
about
it
.
<EOS>
But
,
my
dear
,
added
he
,
you
'll
mention
this
to
your
father
,
if
you
please
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
<EOS>
too
much
money
,
Longman
,
continued
he
,
lies
useless
;
though
,
upon
this
occasion
,
I
shall
not
grudge
laying
out
as
much
in
liveries
and
other
things
,
as
if
I
had
married
a
lady
of
a
fortune
equal
,
if
possible
,
to
my
Pamela
's
merit
;
and
I
reckon
you
have
a
good
deal
in
hand
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
sir
,
said
he
,
more
than
I
wish
I
had
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
have
a
mortgage
in
view
<EOS>
,
if
you
do
n't
buy
that
Kentish
thing
,
that
I
believe
will
answer
very
well
;
and
when
matters
are
riper
,
will
mention
it
to
your
honour
.
  
<EOS>
I
took
with
me
,
to
Lincolnshire
,
said
my
master
,
upwards
of
six
hundred
guineas
,
and
thought
to
have
laid
most
of
them
out
there
:
(
Thank
God
,
thought
I
,
you
did
not
!
<EOS>
for
he
offered
me
five
hundred
of
them
,
you
know
:
)
<EOS>
but
I
have
not
laid
out
above
two
hundred
and
fifty
of
them
;
so
two
hundred
<EOS>
I
left
there
in
my
escritoire
;
because
I
shall
go
again
for
a
fortnight
or
so
,
before
winter
;
and
two
hundred
I
have
brought
with
me
:
<EOS>
and
I
have
money
<EOS>
,
I
know
not
what
,
in
three
places
here
,
the
account
of
which
is
in
my
pocket
-
book
,
in
my
library
.
  
<EOS>
You
have
made
some
little
presents
,
Pamela
,
to
my
servants
there
,
on
our
nuptials
;
and
these
two
hundred
that
I
have
brought
up
,
I
will
put
into
your
disposal
,
that
,
with
some
of
them
,
you
shall
do
here
as
you
did
there
.
  
<EOS>
I
am
ashamed
,
good
sir
,
said
I
,
to
be
so
costly
,
and
so
worthless
!
 
<EOS>
Pray
,
my
dear
,
replied
he
,
say
not
a
word
of
that
.
 
<EOS>
Said
Mr.
Longman
,
Why
,
madam
,
with
money
in
stocks
,
and
one
thing
or
another
,
his
honour
could
buy
half
the
gentlemen
around
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
wants
not
money
,
and
lays
up
every
year
.
 
<EOS>
And
it
would
have
been
pity
but
<EOS>
his
honour
should
have
wedded
just
as
he
has
.
 
<EOS>
Very
true
,
Longman
,
said
my
master
;
and
,
pulling
out
his
purse
,
said
,
Tell
out
,
my
dear
,
two
hundred
guineas
,
and
give
me
the
rest
.
 
<EOS>
I
did
so
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
said
he
,
take
them
yourself
,
for
the
purposes
I
mentioned
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
Mr.
Longman
,
do
you
,
before
sunset
,
bring
my
dear
girl
fifty
pounds
,
which
is
due
to
her
this
day
,
by
my
promise
;
and
every
three
months
,
from
this
day
,
pay
her
fifty
pounds
;
<EOS>
which
will
be
two
hundred
pounds
per
annum
;
and
this
is
for
her
to
lay
out
at
her
own
discretion
,
and
without
account
,
in
such
a
way
as
shall
derive
a
blessing
upon
us
all
:
for
she
was
my
mother
's
almoner
,
and
shall
be
mine
,
and
her
own
too
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
go
for
it
<EOS>
this
instant
,
said
Mr.
Longman
.
  
<EOS>
When
he
was
done
,
I
looked
upon
my
dear
generous
master
,
and
on
Mrs.
Jervis
,
and
he
gave
me
a
nod
of
assent
;
and
I
took
twenty
guineas
,
and
said
,
Dear
Mrs.
Jervis
,
accept
of
this
,
which
is
no
more
than
my
generous
master
ordered
me
to
present
to
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
for
a
pair
of
gloves
,
on
my
happy
nuptials
;
and
so
you
,
who
are
much
better
entitled
to
them
by
the
love
I
bear
you
,
must
not
refuse
them
.
  
<EOS>
Said
she
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
was
on
the
spot
,
madam
,
at
the
happy
time
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
said
my
master
;
but
Pamela
would
have
rejoiced
to
have
had
you
there
instead
of
her
.
 
<EOS>
That
I
should
,
sir
,
replied
I
,
or
instead
of
any
body
,
except
my
own
mother
.
 
<EOS>
She
gratefully
accepted
them
,
and
thanked
us
both
:
<EOS>
But
I
do
n't
know
what
she
should
thank
me
for
;
for
I
was
not
worth
a
fourth
of
them
myself
.
  
<EOS>
I
'd
have
you
,
my
dear
,
said
he
,
in
some
handsome
manner
,
as
you
know
how
,
oblige
Longman
to
accept
of
the
like
present
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Longman
returned
from
his
office
,
and
brought
me
the
fifty
pounds
,
saying
,
I
have
entered
this
new
article
with
great
pleasure
:
"
To
my
Lady
fifty
pounds
:
to
be
paid
the
same
sum
quarterly
.
"
 
<EOS>
O
sir
!
<EOS>
said
I
,
what
will
become
of
me
,
to
be
so
poor
in
myself
,
and
so
rich
in
your
bounty
!
  
<EOS>
It
is
a
shame
to
take
all
that
your
profuse
goodness
would
heap
upon
me
thus
:
<EOS>
But
indeed
it
shall
not
be
without
account
.
 
<EOS>
Make
no
words
,
my
dear
,
said
he
:
Are
you
not
my
wife
?
 
<EOS>
And
have
I
not
endowed
you
with
my
goods
;
and
,
hitherto
,
this
is
a
very
small
part
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Longman
,
said
I
,
and
Mrs.
Jervis
,
you
both
see
how
I
am
even
oppressed
with
unreturnable
obligations
.
 
<EOS>
God
bless
the
donor
,
and
the
receiver
too
!
<EOS>
said
Mr.
Longman
:
<EOS>
I
am
sure
they
will
bring
back
good
interest
;
for
,
madam
,
you
had
ever
a
bountiful
heart
;
and
I
have
seen
the
pleasure
you
used
to
take
to
dispense
my
late
lady
's
alms
and
donations
.
  
<EOS>
I
'll
warrant
,
Mr.
Longman
,
said
I
,
notwithstanding
you
are
so
willing
to
have
me
take
large
sums
for
nothing
at
all
,
I
should
affront
you
,
if
I
asked
you
to
accept
from
me
a
pair
of
gloves
only
,
on
account
of
my
happy
nuptials
.
 
<EOS>
He
seemed
not
readily
to
know
how
to
answer
;
and
my
master
said
,
If
Longman
refuse
you
,
my
dear
,
he
may
be
said
to
refuse
your
first
favour
.
 
<EOS>
On
that
I
put
twenty
guineas
in
his
hand
;
but
he
insisted
upon
it
,
that
he
would
take
but
five
.
 
<EOS>
I
said
,
I
must
desire
you
to
oblige
me
,
Mr.
Longman
,
or
<EOS>
I
shall
think
I
have
affronted
you
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
if
I
must
,
said
he
,
<EOS>
I
know
what
I
know
.
 
<EOS>
What
is
that
,
Mr.
Longman
?
<EOS>
said
I.
 
Why
,
madam
<EOS>
,
said
he
,
I
will
not
lay
it
out
till
my
young
master
's
birth
-
day
,
which
I
hope
will
be
within
this
twelvemonth
.
  
<EOS>
Not
expecting
anything
like
this
from
the
old
gentleman
,
I
looked
at
my
master
,
and
then
blushed
so
<EOS>
,
I
could
not
hold
up
my
head
.
 
<EOS>
Charmingly
said
,
Longman
!
<EOS>
said
my
master
,
and
clasped
me
in
his
arms
:
O
,
my
dear
life
!
 
<EOS>
God
send
it
may
be
so
!
 
<EOS>
You
have
quite
delighted
me
,
Longman
!
<EOS>
Though
I
durst
not
have
said
such
a
thing
for
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
Madam
,
said
the
old
gentleman
<EOS>
,
I
beg
your
pardon
;
I
hope
no
offence
:
but
I
'd
speak
it
ten
times
in
a
breath
to
have
it
so
,
take
it
<EOS>
how
you
please
,
as
long
as
my
good
master
takes
it
so
well
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jervis
,
said
my
master
,
this
is
an
over
-
nice
dear
creature
;
you
do
n't
know
what
a
life
I
have
had
with
her
,
even
on
this
side
matrimony
.
 
<EOS>
Said
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jervis
,
I
think
Mr.
Longman
says
very
well
;
I
am
sure
I
shall
hope
for
it
too
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Longman
,
who
had
struck
me
of
a
heap
,
withdrawing
soon
after
,
my
master
said
,
Why
,
my
dear
,
you
ca
n't
look
up
!
 
<EOS>
The
old
man
said
nothing
shocking
.
 
<EOS>
I
did
not
expect
it
,
though
,
from
him
,
said
I.
 
I
was
not
aware
<EOS>
but
of
some
innocent
pleasantry
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
so
it
was
,
said
he
,
both
innocent
and
pleasant
:
<EOS>
and
I
wo
n't
forgive
you
,
if
you
do
n't
say
as
he
says
.
 
<EOS>
Come
,
speak
before
Mrs.
Jervis
.
 
<EOS>
May
every
thing
happen
,
sir
,
said
I
,
that
will
give
you
delight
!
 
<EOS>
That
's
my
dearest
love
,
said
he
,
and
kissed
me
with
great
tenderness
.
  
<EOS>
When
the
servants
had
dined
,
I
desired
to
see
the
maidens
;
and
all
four
came
up
together
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
welcome
home
,
madam
,
said
Rachel
;
we
rejoice
all
to
see
you
here
,
and
more
to
see
you
our
lady
.
 
<EOS>
O
my
good
old
acquaintances
<EOS>
,
said
I
,
I
joy
to
see
you
!
 
<EOS>
How
do
you
do
,
Rachel
?
 
<EOS>
How
do
you
all
do
?
 
<EOS>
And
I
took
each
of
them
by
the
hand
,
and
could
have
kissed
them
.
 
<EOS>
For
,
said
I
to
myself
,
I
kissed
you
all
,
<EOS>
last
time
I
saw
you
,
in
sorrow
;
why
should
I
not
kiss
you
all
with
joy
?
 
<EOS>
But
I
forbore
,
in
honour
of
their
master
's
presence
.
  
<EOS>
They
seemed
quite
transported
with
me
:
and
my
good
master
was
pleased
with
the
scene
.
 
<EOS>
See
here
,
my
lasses
,
said
he
,
your
mistress
!
 
<EOS>
I
need
not
bid
you
respect
her
;
for
you
always
loved
her
;
and
she
'll
have
it
as
much
in
her
power
as
inclination
to
be
kind
to
the
deserving
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
said
I
<EOS>
,
I
shall
always
be
a
kind
friend
to
you
;
and
your
dear
master
has
ordered
me
to
give
each
of
you
this
,
that
you
may
rejoice
with
me
on
my
happiness
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
I
gave
them
five
guineas
a
-
piece
,
and
said
,
God
bless
you
every
one
!
 
<EOS>
I
am
overjoyed
to
see
you
!
 
<EOS>
And
they
withdrew
with
the
greatest
gratitude
and
pleasure
,
praying
for
us
both
.
  
<EOS>
I
turned
to
my
dear
master
:
'
Tis
to
you
,
dear
sir
,
said
I
,
next
to
God
,
who
put
it
into
your
generous
heart
,
that
all
my
happiness
is
owing
!
<EOS>
That
my
mind
thus
overflows
with
joy
and
gratitude
!
 
<EOS>
And
I
would
have
kissed
his
hand
;
but
he
clasped
me
in
his
arms
,
and
said
,
You
deserve
it
,
<EOS>
my
dear
<EOS>
:
You
deserve
it
all
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jervis
came
in
.
 
<EOS>
Said
she
<EOS>
,
I
have
seen
a
very
affecting
sight
;
you
have
made
your
maidens
quite
happy
,
<EOS>
madam
,
with
your
kindness
and
condescension
!
 
<EOS>
I
saw
them
all
four
,
as
I
came
by
the
hall
-
door
,
just
got
up
from
their
knees
,
praising
and
praying
for
you
both
!
 
<EOS>
Dear
good
bodies
!
<EOS>
said
I
;
and
did
Jane
pray
too
?
 
<EOS>
May
their
prayers
be
returned
upon
themselves
,
I
say
!
  
<EOS>
My
master
sent
for
Jonathan
,
and
I
held
up
all
the
fingers
of
my
two
hands
;
and
my
master
giving
a
nod
of
approbation
as
he
came
in
,
I
said
,
Well
,
Mr.
Jonathan
,
I
could
not
be
satisfied
without
seeing
you
in
form
,
as
it
were
,
and
thanking
you
for
all
your
past
good
-
will
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
You
'll
accept
of
that
,
for
a
pair
of
gloves
,
on
this
happy
occasion
;
and
I
gave
him
ten
guineas
,
and
took
his
honest
hand
between
both
mine
:
<EOS>
God
bless
you
,
said
I
,
with
your
silver
hairs
,
so
like
my
dear
father
!
 
<EOS>
I
shall
always
value
such
a
good
old
servant
of
the
best
of
masters
!
 
<EOS>
He
said
,
O
<EOS>
such
goodness
!
 
<EOS>
Such
kind
words
!
 
<EOS>
It
is
balm
to
my
heart
!
 
<EOS>
Blessed
be
God
I
have
lived
to
this
day
!
 
<EOS>
And
his
eyes
swam
in
tears
,
and
<EOS>
he
withdrew
.
  
<EOS>
My
dear
,
said
my
master
,
you
make
every
one
happy
!
 
<EOS>
O
,
sir
,
said
I
,
'
tis
you
,
'
tis
you
!
 
<EOS>
And
let
my
grateful
heart
always
spring
to
my
lips
,
to
acknowledge
the
blessings
you
heap
upon
me
.
  
<EOS>
Then
in
came
Harry
,
and
Isaac
,
and
Benjamin
,
and
the
two
grooms
of
this
house
,
and
Arthur
the
gardener
;
for
my
dear
master
had
ordered
them
,
by
Mrs.
Jervis
,
thus
to
be
marshalled
out
:
and
he
said
,
Where
's
John
?
 
<EOS>
Poor
John
was
ashamed
,
and
did
not
come
in
till
he
heard
himself
called
for
.
<EOS>
I
said
to
them
,
How
do
you
do
,
my
old
friends
and
fellow
-
servants
?
 
<EOS>
I
am
glad
to
see
you
all
.
  
<EOS>
My
master
said
,
I
have
given
you
a
mistress
,
<EOS>
my
lads
,
that
is
the
joy
of
my
heart
:
You
see
her
goodness
and
condescension
!
 
<EOS>
Let
your
respects
to
her
be
but
answerable
,
and
she
'll
be
proportionately
as
great
a
blessing
to
you
all
,
as
she
is
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
Harry
said
,
In
the
names
of
all
your
servants
,
sir
,
I
bless
your
honour
,
and
your
good
lady
:
and
it
shall
be
all
our
studies
to
deserve
her
ladyship
's
favours
,
as
well
as
your
honour
's
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
I
gave
every
one
five
guineas
,
to
rejoice
,
as
I
said
,
in
my
happiness
.
  
<EOS>
When
I
came
to
John
,
I
said
,
I
saw
you
before
,
John
;
but
I
again
tell
you
,
I
am
glad
to
see
you
.
 
<EOS>
He
said
,
he
was
quite
ashamed
and
confounded
.
<EOS>
O
,
said
I
,
forget
every
thing
that
's
past
,
John
!
 
<EOS>
Your
dear
good
master
will
,
and
so
will
I.
 
For
God
has
wonderfully
brought
about
all
these
things
,
by
the
very
means
I
once
thought
most
grievous
.
 
<EOS>
Let
us
,
therefore
,
look
forward
,
and
be
only
ashamed
to
commit
faults
for
the
time
to
come
:
for
they
may
not
always
be
attended
with
like
happy
consequences
.
  
<EOS>
Arthur
,
said
my
master
,
I
have
brought
you
a
mistress
that
is
a
great
gardener
.
 
<EOS>
She
'll
shew
you
a
new
way
to
plant
beans
:
<EOS>
And
never
any
body
had
such
a
hand
at
improving
a
sun
-
flower
as
she
!
 
<EOS>
O
sir
,
sir
,
said
I
,
(
but
yet
a
little
dashed
,
)
<EOS>
all
my
improvements
in
every
kind
of
thing
are
owing
to
you
,
I
am
sure
!
 
<EOS>
And
so
I
think
I
was
even
with
the
dear
man
,
and
yet
appeared
grateful
before
his
servants
.
 
<EOS>
They
withdrew
,
blessing
us
both
,
as
the
rest
had
done
.
 
<EOS>
And
then
came
in
the
postilion
,
and
two
helpers
,
(
for
my
master
has
both
here
,
and
at
Lincolnshire
,
fine
hunting
horses
;
and
it
is
the
chief
sport
he
takes
delight
in
,
)
as
also
the
scullion
-
boy
:
<EOS>
And
I
said
,
How
do
all
of
you
?
 
<EOS>
And
how
dost
do
,
Tommy
?
 
<EOS>
I
hope
you
're
very
good
.
 
<EOS>
Here
your
dear
master
has
ordered
you
something
a
-
piece
,
in
honour
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
And
my
master
holding
three
fingers
to
me
,
I
gave
the
postilion
and
helpers
three
guineas
each
,
and
the
little
boy
two
;
and
bid
him
let
his
poor
mother
lay
it
out
for
him
,
for
he
must
not
spend
it
idly
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Colbrand
,
Abraham
,
and
Thomas
,
I
had
before
presented
at
t'other
house
.
  
<EOS>
And
when
they
were
all
gone
but
Mrs.
Jervis
,
I
said
,
<EOS>
And
now
,
dearest
sir
,
permit
me
,
on
my
knees
,
thus
to
bless
you
,
and
pray
for
you
.
 
<EOS>
And
oh
,
may
God
crown
you
with
length
of
days
,
and
increase
of
honour
;
and
may
your
happy
,
happy
Pamela
,
by
her
grateful
heart
,
appear
always
worthy
in
your
dear
eyes
,
though
she
can
not
be
so
in
her
own
,
nor
in
those
of
any
others
!
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jervis
,
said
my
master
,
you
see
the
excellency
of
this
sweet
creature
!
 
<EOS>
And
when
I
tell
you
that
the
charms
of
her
person
,
all
lovely
as
she
is
,
bind
me
not
so
strongly
to
her
,
as
the
graces
of
her
mind
;
congratulate
me
,
that
my
happiness
is
built
on
so
stable
a
basis
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
I
do
,
most
sincerely
,
sir
,
said
she
:
<EOS>
This
is
a
happy
day
to
me
!
  
<EOS>
I
stept
into
the
library
,
while
he
was
thus
pouring
out
his
kindness
for
me
to
Mrs.
Jervis
;
and
blessed
God
there
on
my
knees
,
for
the
difference
I
now
found
to
what
I
had
once
known
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
And
when
I
have
done
the
same
in
the
first
scene
of
my
fears
,
the
once
frightful
summer
-
house
,
I
shall
have
gone
through
most
of
my
distressful
scenes
with
gratitude
;
but
shall
never
forbear
thanking
God
in
my
mind
,
for
his
goodness
to
me
in
every
one
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jervis
,
I
find
,
had
whispered
him
what
I
had
done
above
,
and
he
saw
me
upon
my
knees
,
with
my
back
towards
him
,
unknown
to
me
;
but
softly
put
to
the
door
again
,
as
he
had
opened
it
a
little
way
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
said
,
not
knowing
he
had
seen
me
,
You
have
some
charming
pictures
here
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
said
he
,
my
dear
life
,
so
I
have
;
but
none
equal
to
that
which
your
piety
affords
me
;
And
may
the
God
you
delight
to
serve
,
bless
more
and
more
my
dear
angel
!
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
said
I
,
you
are
all
goodness
!
 
<EOS>
I
hope
,
replied
he
,
after
your
sweet
example
,
I
shall
be
better
and
better
.
  
<EOS>
Do
you
think
,
my
dear
father
and
mother
,
there
ever
was
so
happy
a
creature
as
I
?
 
<EOS>
To
be
sure
it
would
be
very
ungrateful
to
think
with
uneasiness
,
or
any
thing
but
compassion
,
of
poor
Miss
Sally
Godfrey
.
  
<EOS>
He
ordered
Jonathan
to
let
the
evening
be
passed
merrily
,
but
wisely
,
as
he
said
,
with
what
every
one
liked
,
whether
wine
or
October
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
pleased
afterwards
to
lead
me
up
stairs
,
and
gave
me
possession
of
my
lady
's
dressing
-
room
and
cabinet
,
and
her
fine
repeating
-
watch
and
equipage
;
and
,
in
short
,
of
a
complete
set
of
diamonds
,
that
were
his
good
mother
's
;
as
also
of
the
two
pair
of
diamond
ear
-
rings
,
the
two
diamond
rings
,
and
diamond
necklace
,
he
mentioned
in
his
naughty
articles
,
which
her
ladyship
had
intended
for
presents
to
Miss
Tomlins
,
a
rich
heiress
,
that
was
proposed
for
his
wife
,
when
he
was
just
come
from
his
travels
;
but
which
went
off
,
after
all
was
agreed
upon
on
both
the
friends
'
sides
,
because
he
approved
not
her
conversation
;
and
she
had
,
as
he
told
his
mother
,
too
masculine
an
air
;
and
he
never
could
be
brought
to
see
her
but
once
,
though
the
lady
liked
him
very
well
.
 
<EOS>
He
presented
me
also
with
her
ladyship
's
books
,
pictures
,
linen
,
laces
,
etc
.
<EOS>
that
were
in
her
apartments
;
and
bid
me
call
those
apartments
mine
.
 
<EOS>
O
give
me
,
my
good
God
!
<EOS>
humility
and
gratitude
.
  
<EOS>
Sunday
night
.
  
<EOS>
This
day
,
as
matters
could
not
be
ready
for
our
appearance
at
a
better
place
,
we
staid
at
home
;
and
my
dear
master
employed
himself
a
good
deal
in
his
library
:
<EOS>
And
I
have
been
taken
up
pretty
much
<EOS>
,
I
hope
,
as
I
ought
to
be
,
in
thankfulness
,
prayer
and
meditation
,
in
my
newly
-
presented
closet
<EOS>
And
I
hope
God
will
be
pleased
to
give
a
blessing
to
me
;
for
I
have
the
pleasure
to
think
I
am
not
puffed
up
with
this
great
alteration
;
and
yet
am
I
not
wanting
to
look
upon
all
these
favours
and
blessings
in
the
light
<EOS>
wherein
I
ought
to
receive
them
,
both
at
the
hands
of
Heaven
,
and
my
dear
benefactor
.
  
<EOS>
We
dined
together
with
great
pleasure
;
and
I
had
,
in
every
word
and
action
,
all
the
instances
of
kindness
and
affection
that
the
most
indulged
heart
could
wish
.
 
<EOS>
He
said
he
would
return
to
his
closet
again
;
and
at
five
o'clock
would
come
and
take
a
walk
with
me
in
the
garden
:
<EOS>
And
so
retired
as
soon
as
he
had
dined
,
and
I
went
up
to
mine
.
  
<EOS>
About
six
,
he
was
pleased
to
come
up
to
me
,
and
said
,
Now
,
my
dear
,
I
will
attend
you
for
a
little
walk
in
the
garden
;
and
I
gave
him
my
hand
with
great
pleasure
.
  
<EOS>
This
garden
is
much
better
cultivated
than
the
Lincolnshire
one
;
but
that
is
larger
,
and
has
nobler
walks
in
it
;
and
yet
there
is
a
pretty
canal
in
this
,
and
a
fountain
and
cascade
.
 
<EOS>
We
had
a
deal
of
sweet
conversation
as
we
walked
;
and
,
after
we
had
taken
a
turn
round
,
I
bent
towards
the
little
garden
;
and
when
I
came
near
the
summer
-
house
,
took
the
opportunity
to
slip
from
him
,
and
just
whipt
up
the
steps
of
this
once
frightful
place
,
and
kneeled
down
,
and
said
,
I
bless
thee
,
O
God
!
<EOS>
for
my
escapes
,
and
for
thy
mercies
!
 
<EOS>
O
let
me
always
possess
a
grateful
,
humble
heart
!
<EOS>
and
I
whipt
down
again
and
joined
him
;
and
he
hardly
missed
me
.
  
<EOS>
Several
of
the
neighbouring
gentry
sent
their
compliments
to
him
on
his
return
,
but
not
a
word
about
his
marriage
;
particularly
Mr.
Arthur
,
Mr.
Towers
,
Mr.
Brooks
,
and
Mr.
Martin
of
the
Grove
.
  
<EOS>
Monday
.
  
<EOS>
I
had
a
good
deal
of
employment
in
choosing
patterns
for
my
new
clothes
.
<EOS>
He
thought
nothing
too
good
;
but
I
thought
every
thing
I
saw
was
;
and
he
was
so
kind
to
pick
out
six
of
the
richest
for
me
to
choose
three
suits
out
of
,
saying
,
We
would
furnish
ourselves
with
more
in
town
,
when
we
went
thither
.
 
<EOS>
One
was
white
,
flowered
with
silver
most
richly
;
and
he
was
pleased
to
say
,
that
,
as
I
was
a
bride
,
I
should
make
my
appearance
in
that
the
following
Sunday
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
we
shall
have
in
two
or
three
days
,
from
several
places
,
nothing
but
mantua
-
makers
and
tailors
at
work
.
<EOS>
Bless
me
!
<EOS>
what
a
chargeable
and
what
a
worthless
hussy
<EOS>
I
am
to
the
dear
gentleman
!
 
<EOS>
But
his
fortune
and
station
require
a
great
deal
of
it
;
and
his
value
for
me
will
not
let
him
do
less
,
than
if
he
had
married
a
fortune
equal
to
his
own
:
and
then
,
as
he
says
,
it
would
be
a
reflection
upon
him
,
if
he
did
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
I
doubt
it
will
be
,
as
it
is
:
For
either
way
the
world
will
have
something
to
say
.
 
<EOS>
He
made
me
also
choose
some
very
fine
laces
,
and
linen
;
and
has
sent
a
message
on
purpose
,
with
his
orders
,
to
hasten
all
down
,
what
can
be
done
in
town
,
as
the
millinery
matters
,
etc
.
<EOS>
to
be
completed
there
,
and
sent
by
particular
messengers
,
as
done
.
 
<EOS>
All
to
be
here
,
and
finished
by
Saturday
afternoon
,
without
fail
.
  
<EOS>
I
sent
away
John
this
morning
,
with
some
more
of
my
papers
to
you
,
and
with
the
few
he
will
give
you
separate
.
 
<EOS>
My
desire
is
,
that
you
will
send
me
all
the
papers
you
have
done
with
,
that
I
may
keep
my
word
with
Lady
Davers
;
to
beg
the
continuance
of
your
prayers
and
blessings
;
to
hope
you
will
give
me
your
answer
about
my
dear
benefactor
's
proposal
of
the
Kentish
farm
;
to
beg
you
to
buy
,
two
suits
of
clothes
each
;
of
the
finest
cloth
for
you
,
my
dear
father
;
and
of
a
creditable
silk
for
my
dear
mother
;
and
good
linen
,
and
every
thing
answerable
;
and
that
you
will
,
as
my
best
friend
bid
me
say
,
let
us
see
you
here
as
soon
as
possible
;
and
he
will
have
his
chariot
come
for
you
,
when
you
tell
John
the
day
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
how
I
long
to
see
you
both
,
my
dear
good
parents
,
and
to
share
with
you
my
felicities
!
  
<EOS>
You
will
have
<EOS>
,
I
'm
sure
,
the
goodness
to
go
to
all
your
creditors
,
which
are
chiefly
those
of
my
poor
unhappy
brothers
,
and
get
an
account
of
all
you
are
bound
for
;
and
every
one
shall
be
paid
to
the
utmost
farthing
,
and
interest
besides
,
though
some
of
them
have
been
very
cruel
and
unrelenting
.
 
<EOS>
But
they
are
entitled
to
their
own
,
and
shall
be
thankfully
paid
.
  
<EOS>
Now
I
think
of
it
,
John
shall
take
my
papers
down
to
this
place
;
that
you
may
have
something
to
amuse
you
,
of
your
dear
child
's
,
instead
of
those
you
part
with
;
and
I
will
continue
writing
till
I
am
settled
,
and
you
are
determined
;
and
then
I
shall
apply
myself
to
the
duties
of
the
family
,
in
order
to
become
as
useful
to
my
dear
benefactor
,
as
my
small
abilities
will
let
me
.
  
<EOS>
If
you
think
a
couple
of
guineas
will
be
of
use
to
Mrs.
Mumford
,
who
,
I
doubt
,
has
not
much
aforehand
,
pray
give
them
to
her
,
from
me
,
(
and
I
will
return
them
to
you
,
)
as
for
a
pair
of
gloves
on
my
nuptials
:
And
look
through
your
poor
acquaintances
and
neighbours
,
and
let
me
have
a
list
of
such
honest
industrious
poor
,
as
may
be
true
objects
of
charity
,
and
have
no
other
assistance
;
particularly
such
as
are
blind
,
lame
,
or
sickly
,
with
their
several
cases
;
and
also
such
poor
families
and
housekeepers
as
are
reduced
by
misfortunes
,
as
ours
was
,
and
where
a
great
number
of
children
may
keep
them
from
rising
to
a
state
of
tolerable
comfort
:
<EOS>
And
I
will
choose
as
well
as
I
can
;
for
I
long
to
be
making
a
beginning
,
with
the
kind
quarterly
benevolence
<EOS>
my
dear
good
benefactor
has
bestowed
upon
me
for
such
good
purposes
.
  
<EOS>
I
am
resolved
to
keep
account
of
all
these
matters
,
and
Mr.
Longman
has
already
furnished
me
with
a
vellum
book
of
white
paper
;
some
sides
of
which
I
hope
soon
to
fill
with
the
names
of
proper
objects
:
<EOS>
And
though
my
dear
master
has
given
me
all
this
without
account
,
yet
shall
he
see
(
but
nobody
else
)
<EOS>
how
I
lay
it
out
,
from
quarter
to
quarter
;
and
I
will
,
if
any
be
left
,
carry
it
on
,
like
an
accomptant
,
to
the
next
quarter
,
and
strike
a
balance
four
times
a
year
,
and
a
general
balance
at
every
year
's
end
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
have
written
in
it
,
Humble
RETURNS
for
DIVINE
MERCIES
;
and
locked
it
up
safe
in
my
newly
-
presented
cabinet
.
  
<EOS>
I
intend
to
let
Lady
Davers
see
no
farther
of
my
papers
,
than
to
her
own
angry
letter
to
her
brother
;
for
I
would
not
have
her
see
my
reflections
upon
it
;
and
she
'll
know
,
down
to
that
place
,
all
that
's
necessary
for
her
curiosity
,
as
to
my
sufferings
,
and
the
stratagems
used
against
me
,
and
the
honest
part
I
have
been
enabled
to
act
:
<EOS>
And
I
hope
,
when
she
has
read
them
all
,
she
will
be
quite
reconciled
:
for
she
will
see
it
is
all
God
Almighty
's
doings
;
and
that
a
gentleman
of
his
parts
and
knowledge
was
not
to
be
drawn
in
by
such
a
poor
young
body
as
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
will
detain
John
no
longer
.
 
<EOS>
He
will
tell
you
to
read
this
last
part
first
,
and
while
he
stays
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
,
with
my
humble
duty
to
you
both
,
and
my
dear
Mr.
B
#
#
#
#
's
kind
remembrance
,
I
rest
                       
<EOS>
Your
ever
-
dutiful
and
gratefully
happy
DAUGHTER
.
  
<EOS>
Wednesday
evening
.
  
<EOS>
HONOURED
FATHER
AND
MOTHER
!
  
<EOS>
I
will
now
proceed
with
my
journal
.
  
<EOS>
On
Tuesday
morning
,
my
dear
sir
rode
out
,
and
brought
with
him
to
dinner
,
Mr.
Martin
of
the
Grove
,
and
Mr.
Arthur
,
and
Mr.
Brooks
,
and
one
Mr.
Chambers
;
and
he
stept
up
to
me
,
and
said
he
had
rode
out
too
far
to
return
to
breakfast
;
but
he
had
brought
with
him
some
of
his
old
acquaintance
,
to
dine
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
Are
you
sorry
for
it
,
Pamela
?
<EOS>
said
he
.
 
<EOS>
I
remembered
his
lessons
,
and
said
No
,
sure
,
sir
;
I
can
not
be
angry
at
any
thing
you
are
pleased
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
Said
he
,
You
know
Mr.
Martin
's
character
,
and
have
severely
censured
him
in
one
of
your
letters
,
as
one
of
my
brother
rakes
,
and
for
his
three
lyings
-
in
.
  
<EOS>
He
then
gave
me
the
following
account
,
how
he
came
to
bring
them
.
 
<EOS>
Said
he
,
"
I
met
them
all
at
Mr.
Arthur
's
;
and
his
lady
asked
me
,
if
I
was
really
married
?
 
<EOS>
I
said
,
Yes
,
really
.
 
<EOS>
And
to
whom
?
said
Mr.
Martin
.
<EOS>
Why
,
replied
I
,
bluntly
,
to
my
mother
's
waiting
-
maid
.
 
<EOS>
They
could
not
tell
what
to
say
to
me
hereupon
,
and
looked
one
upon
another
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
saw
I
had
spoiled
a
jest
,
from
each
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Arthur
said
,
You
have
,
indeed
,
sir
,
a
charming
creature
,
as
ever
I
saw
;
and
she
has
mighty
good
luck
.
<EOS>
Ay
,
said
I
,
and
so
have
I.
 
<EOS>
But
I
shall
say
the
less
,
<EOS>
because
a
man
never
did
any
thing
of
this
nature
,
that
he
did
not
think
he
ought
,
if
it
were
but
in
policy
,
to
make
the
best
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
Nay
,
said
Mr.
Arthur
,
if
you
have
sinned
,
it
is
with
your
eyes
open
:
for
you
know
the
world
as
well
as
any
gentleman
of
your
years
in
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
really
,
gentlemen
,
said
I
,
I
should
be
glad
to
please
all
my
friends
;
but
I
ca
n't
expect
,
till
they
know
my
motives
and
inducements
,
that
it
will
be
so
immediately
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
do
assure
you
,
I
am
exceedingly
pleased
myself
;
and
that
,
you
know
,
is
most
to
the
purpose
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Said
Mr.
Brooks
,
I
have
heard
my
wife
praise
your
spouse
that
is
,
so
much
for
person
and
beauty
,
that
I
wanted
to
see
her
of
all
things
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
replied
I
,
if
you
'll
all
go
and
take
a
dinner
with
me
,
you
shall
see
her
with
all
my
heart
.
 
<EOS>
And
,
Mrs.
Arthur
,
will
you
bear
us
company
?
 
<EOS>
No
,
indeed
,
sir
,
said
she
.
 
<EOS>
What
,
I
'll
warrant
,
my
wife
will
not
be
able
to
reconcile
you
to
my
mother
's
waiting
-
maid
;
is
not
that
it
?
 
<EOS>
Tell
truth
,
Mrs.
Arthur
.
 
<EOS>
Nay
,
said
she
,
I
sha
n't
be
backward
to
pay
your
spouse
a
visit
,
in
company
of
the
neighbouring
ladies
;
but
for
one
single
woman
to
go
,
on
such
a
sudden
motion
too
,
with
so
many
gentlemen
,
is
not
right
.
<EOS>
But
that
need
not
hinder
you
,
gentlemen
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
said
he
,
the
rest
sent
,
that
they
should
not
dine
at
home
;
and
they
and
Mr.
Chambers
,
a
gentleman
lately
settled
in
these
parts
,
one
and
all
came
with
me
:
<EOS>
And
so
,
my
dear
,
concluded
he
,
when
you
make
your
appearance
next
Sunday
,
you
're
sure
of
a
party
in
your
favour
;
for
all
that
see
you
must
esteem
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
went
to
them
;
and
when
I
came
down
to
dinner
,
he
was
pleased
to
take
me
by
the
hand
,
at
my
entrance
into
the
parlour
,
and
said
,
My
dear
,
I
have
brought
some
of
my
good
neighbours
to
dine
with
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
said
,
You
are
very
good
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
My
dear
,
this
gentleman
is
Mr.
Chambers
;
and
so
he
presented
every
one
to
me
;
and
they
saluted
me
,
and
wished
us
both
joy
.
  
<EOS>
I
,
for
my
part
,
said
Mr.
Brooks
,
wish
you
joy
most
heartily
.
 
<EOS>
My
wife
told
me
a
good
deal
of
the
beauties
of
your
person
;
but
I
did
not
think
we
had
such
a
flower
in
our
country
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
said
I
,
your
lady
is
very
partial
to
me
;
and
you
are
so
polite
a
gentleman
,
that
you
will
not
contradict
your
good
lady
.
  
<EOS>
I
'll
assure
you
,
madam
,
returned
he
<EOS>
,
you
have
not
hit
the
matter
at
all
;
for
we
contradict
one
another
twice
or
thrice
a
day
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
devil
's
in't
<EOS>
if
we
are
not
agreed
in
so
clear
a
case
!
  
<EOS>
Said
Mr.
Martin
<EOS>
,
Mr.
Brooks
says
<EOS>
very
true
,
madam
,
in
both
respects
;
<EOS>
(
meaning
his
wife
's
and
his
own
contradiction
to
one
another
,
as
well
as
in
my
favour
;
)
for
,
added
he
,
they
have
been
married
some
years
.
  
<EOS>
As
I
had
not
the
best
opinion
of
this
gentleman
,
nor
his
jest
,
I
said
,
I
am
almost
sorry
,
sir
,
for
the
gentleman
's
jest
upon
himself
and
his
lady
;
but
I
think
it
should
have
relieved
him
from
a
greater
jest
,
your
pleasant
confirmation
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
But
still
the
reason
you
give
that
it
may
be
so
<EOS>
,
I
hope
,
is
the
reason
that
may
be
given
that
it
is
not
so
;
to
wit
,
that
they
have
been
married
some
years
.
  
<EOS>
Said
Mr.
Arthur
,
Mr.
Martin
<EOS>
,
I
think
the
lady
has
very
handsomely
reproved
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
so
too
,
said
Mr.
Chambers
;
and
it
was
but
a
very
indifferent
compliment
to
a
bride
.
 
<EOS>
Said
Mr.
Martin
,
Compliment
or
not
,
gentlemen
,
I
have
never
seen
a
matrimony
of
any
time
standing
,
that
it
was
not
so
,
little
or
much
:
<EOS>
But
I
dare
say
it
will
never
be
so
here
.
  
<EOS>
To
be
sure
,
sir
,
said
I
,
if
it
was
,
I
must
be
the
ungratefullest
person
in
the
world
,
because
I
am
the
most
obliged
person
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
That
notion
,
said
Mr.
Arthur
,
is
so
excellent
,
that
it
gives
a
moral
certainty
it
never
can
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
,
said
Mr.
Brooks
to
my
dear
master
,
softly
,
You
have
a
most
accomplished
lady
<EOS>
,
I
do
assure
you
,
as
well
in
her
behaviour
and
wit
,
as
in
her
person
,
call
her
what
you
please
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
my
dear
friend
,
said
my
master
,
I
must
tell
you
,
as
I
have
said
before
now
,
that
her
person
made
me
her
lover
,
but
her
mind
made
her
my
wife
.
  
<EOS>
The
first
course
coming
in
,
my
dear
sir
led
me
himself
to
my
place
;
and
set
Mr.
Chambers
,
as
the
greatest
stranger
,
at
my
right
hand
,
and
Mr.
Brooks
at
my
left
;
and
Mr.
Arthur
was
pleased
to
observe
,
much
to
my
advantage
,
on
the
ease
and
freedom
with
which
I
behaved
myself
,
and
helped
them
;
and
said
,
he
would
bring
his
lady
to
be
a
witness
,
and
a
learner
both
,
of
my
manners
.
 
<EOS>
I
said
,
I
should
be
proud
of
any
honour
Mrs.
Arthur
would
vouchsafe
to
do
me
;
and
if
once
I
could
promise
myself
the
opportunity
of
his
good
lady
's
example
,
and
those
of
the
other
gentlemen
present
,
I
should
have
the
greater
opinion
of
my
worthiness
to
sit
in
the
place
I
filled
at
present
with
much
insufficiency
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Arthur
drank
to
my
health
and
happiness
,
and
said
,
My
wife
told
your
spouse
,
madam
,
you
had
very
good
luck
in
such
a
husband
;
but
I
now
see
who
has
the
best
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
Said
Mr.
Brooks
,
Come
,
come
,
<EOS>
let
's
make
no
compliments
;
for
the
plain
truth
of
the
matter
is
,
our
good
neighbour
's
generosity
and
judgment
have
met
with
so
equal
a
match
in
his
lady
's
beauty
and
merit
,
that
I
know
not
which
has
the
best
luck
.
 
<EOS>
But
may
you
be
both
long
happy
together
,
say
I
!
 
<EOS>
And
so
he
drank
a
glass
of
wine
.
  
<EOS>
My
best
friend
,
who
always
takes
delight
to
have
me
praised
,
seemed
much
pleased
with
our
conversation
;
and
he
said
the
kindest
,
tenderest
,
and
most
respectful
things
in
the
world
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
Insomuch
,
that
the
rough
Mr.
Martin
said
,
Did
you
ever
think
our
good
friend
here
,
who
used
to
ridicule
matrimony
so
much
,
would
have
made
so
complaisant
a
husband
?
<EOS>
How
long
do
you
intend
,
sir
,
that
this
shall
hold
?
 
<EOS>
As
long
as
my
good
girl
deserves
it
,
said
he
;
and
that
,
I
hope
,
will
be
for
ever
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
continued
the
kind
gentleman
,
you
need
not
wonder
I
have
changed
my
mind
as
to
wedlock
;
for
I
never
expected
to
meet
with
one
whose
behaviour
and
sweetness
of
temper
were
so
well
adapted
to
make
me
happy
.
  
<EOS>
After
dinner
,
and
having
drank
good
healths
to
each
of
their
ladies
,
I
withdrew
;
and
they
sat
and
drank
two
bottles
of
claret
a
-
piece
,
and
were
very
merry
;
and
went
away
,
full
of
my
praises
,
and
vowing
to
bring
their
ladies
to
see
me
.
  
<EOS>
John
having
brought
me
your
kind
letter
,
my
dear
father
,
I
told
my
good
master
,
after
his
friends
were
gone
,
how
gratefully
you
received
his
generous
intentions
as
to
the
Kentish
farm
,
and
promised
your
best
endeavours
to
serve
him
in
that
estate
;
and
that
you
hoped
your
industry
and
care
would
be
so
well
employed
in
it
,
that
you
should
be
very
little
troublesome
to
him
,
 
as
to
the
liberal
manner
in
which
he
had
intended
to
add
to
a
provision
,
that
of
itself
exceeded
all
you
wished
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
very
well
pleased
with
your
cheerful
acceptance
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
I
am
glad
your
engagements
in
the
world
lie
in
so
small
a
compass
.
 
<EOS>
As
soon
as
you
have
gotten
an
account
of
them
exactly
,
you
will
be
pleased
to
send
it
me
,
with
the
list
of
the
poor
folks
you
are
so
kind
to
promise
to
procure
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
think
,
as
my
dear
master
is
so
generous
,
you
should
account
nothing
that
is
plain
,
too
good
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
do
n't
be
afraid
of
laying
out
upon
yourselves
.
 
<EOS>
My
dear
sir
intends
that
you
shall
not
,
when
you
come
to
us
,
return
to
your
old
abode
;
but
stay
with
us
,
till
you
set
out
for
Kent
;
and
so
you
must
dispose
of
yourselves
accordingly
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
hope
,
my
dear
father
,
you
have
quite
left
off
all
slavish
business
.
 
<EOS>
As
farmer
Jones
has
been
kind
to
you
,
as
I
have
heard
you
say
,
pray
,
when
you
take
leave
of
them
,
present
them
with
three
guineas
worth
of
good
books
;
such
as
a
family
bible
,
a
common
prayer
,
a
whole
duty
of
man
,
or
any
other
you
think
will
be
acceptable
;
for
they
live
a
great
way
from
church
;
and
in
winter
the
ways
from
their
farm
thither
are
impassable
.
  
<EOS>
He
has
brought
me
my
papers
safe
:
and
I
will
send
them
to
Lady
Davers
the
first
opportunity
,
down
to
the
place
I
mentioned
in
my
last
.
  
<EOS>
My
dear
Mr.
B
#
#
#
#
just
now
tells
me
,
that
he
will
carry
me
,
in
the
morning
,
a
little
airing
,
about
ten
miles
off
,
in
his
chariot
and
four
,
to
breakfast
at
a
farm
-
house
,
noted
for
a
fine
dairy
,
and
where
,
now
and
then
,
the
neighbouring
gentry
,
of
both
sexes
,
resort
for
that
purpose
.
  
<EOS>
Thursday
.
  
<EOS>
We
set
out
at
about
half
an
hour
after
six
,
accordingly
;
and
driving
pretty
smartly
,
got
at
this
truly
neat
house
at
half
an
hour
after
eight
;
and
I
was
much
pleased
with
the
neatness
of
the
good
woman
,
and
her
daughter
and
maid
;
and
he
was
so
good
as
to
say
he
would
now
and
then
take
a
turn
with
me
to
the
same
place
,
and
on
the
same
occasion
,
as
I
seemed
to
like
it
;
for
that
it
would
be
a
pretty
exercise
,
and
procure
us
appetites
to
our
breakfasts
,
as
well
as
<EOS>
our
return
would
to
our
dinners
.
<EOS>
But
I
find
this
was
not
,
though
a
very
good
reason
,
the
only
one
for
which
he
gave
me
this
agreeable
airing
;
as
I
shall
acquaint
you
.
  
<EOS>
We
were
prettily
received
and
entertained
here
,
and
an
elegancy
ran
through
every
thing
,
persons
as
well
as
furniture
,
yet
all
plain
.
 
<EOS>
And
my
master
said
to
the
good
housewife
,
<EOS>
Do
your
young
boarding
-
school
ladies
still
at
times
continue
their
visits
to
you
,
Mrs.
Dobson
?
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
sir
,
said
she
,
<EOS>
I
expect
three
or
four
of
them
every
minute
.
  
<EOS>
There
is
,
my
dear
,
said
he
,
within
three
miles
of
this
farm
,
a
very
good
boarding
-
school
for
ladies
.
 
<EOS>
The
governess
of
it
keeps
a
chaise
and
pair
,
which
is
to
be
made
a
double
chaise
at
pleasure
;
and
in
summer
time
,
when
the
misses
perform
their
tasks
to
satisfaction
,
she
favours
them
with
an
airing
to
this
place
,
three
or
four
at
a
time
;
and
after
they
have
breakfasted
,
they
are
carried
back
.
 
<EOS>
And
this
serves
both
for
a
reward
,
and
for
exercise
;
and
the
misses
who
have
this
favour
are
not
a
little
proud
of
it
;
and
it
brings
them
forward
in
their
respective
tasks
.
  
<EOS>
A
very
good
method
,
sir
,
said
I.
 
<EOS>
And
just
as
we
were
talking
,
the
chaise
came
in
with
four
misses
,
all
pretty
much
of
a
size
,
and
a
maid
-
servant
to
attend
them
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
shewn
another
little
neat
apartment
,
that
went
through
ours
;
and
made
their
honours
very
prettily
,
as
they
passed
by
us
.
<EOS>
I
went
into
the
room
to
them
,
and
asked
them
questions
about
their
work
,
and
their
lessons
;
and
what
they
had
done
to
deserve
such
a
fine
airing
and
breakfasting
;
and
they
all
answered
me
very
prettily
.
 
<EOS>
And
pray
,
little
ladies
,
said
I
,
what
may
I
call
your
names
?
 
<EOS>
One
was
called
Miss
Burdoff
,
one
Miss
Nugent
,
one
Miss
Booth
,
and
the
fourth
Miss
Goodwin
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
which
,
said
I
,
is
the
prettiest
;
but
you
are
all
best
,
my
little
dears
;
and
you
have
a
very
good
governess
,
to
indulge
you
with
such
a
fine
airing
,
and
such
delicate
cream
,
and
bread
and
butter
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
you
think
so
too
.
  
<EOS>
My
master
came
in
,
and
I
had
no
mistrust
in
the
world
;
and
he
kissed
each
of
them
;
but
looked
more
wishfully
on
Miss
Goodwin
,
than
on
any
of
the
others
;
but
I
thought
nothing
just
then
:
Had
she
been
called
Miss
Godfrey
<EOS>
,
I
had
hit
upon
it
in
a
trice
.
  
<EOS>
When
we
went
from
them
,
he
said
,
Which
do
you
think
the
prettiest
of
those
misses
?
 
<EOS>
Really
,
sir
,
replied
I
,
it
is
hard
to
say
:
Miss
Booth
is
a
pretty
brown
girl
,
and
has
a
fine
eye
;
Miss
Burdoff
has
a
great
deal
of
sweetness
in
her
countenance
,
but
is
not
so
regularly
featured
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Nugent
is
very
fair
:
and
Miss
Goodwin
has
a
fine
black
eye
,
and
is
,
besides
,
I
think
,
the
genteelest
shaped
child
;
but
they
are
all
pretty
.
  
<EOS>
The
maid
led
them
into
the
garden
,
to
shew
them
the
beehives
;
and
Miss
Goodwin
made
a
particular
fine
courtesy
to
my
master
;
and
I
said
,
I
believe
miss
knows
you
,
sir
;
and
,
taking
her
by
the
hand
,
I
said
,
<EOS>
Do
you
know
this
gentleman
,
<EOS>
my
pretty
dear
?
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
madam
,
said
she
;
it
is
my
own
dear
uncle
.
 
<EOS>
I
clasped
her
in
my
arms
:
O
why
did
you
not
tell
me
,
sir
,
said
I
,
that
you
had
a
niece
among
these
little
ladies
?
 
<EOS>
And
I
kissed
her
,
and
away
she
tript
after
the
others
.
  
<EOS>
But
pray
,
sir
,
said
I
,
how
can
this
be
?
 
<EOS>
You
have
no
sister
nor
brother
,
but
Lady
Davers
.
 
<EOS>
How
can
this
be
?
  
<EOS>
He
smiled
:
<EOS>
and
then
I
said
,
O
<EOS>
my
dearest
sir
,
tell
me
now
the
truth
,
Does
not
this
pretty
miss
stand
in
a
nearer
relation
to
you
,
than
as
a
niece
?
  
<EOS>
I
 
know
she
does
!
 
<EOS>
I
know
she
does
!
 
<EOS>
And
I
embraced
him
as
he
stood
.
  
<EOS>
@@@Tis
<EOS>
even
so
,
my
dear
,
replied
he
;
and
you
remember
my
sister
's
good
-
natured
hint
of
Miss
Sally
Godfrey
?
 
<EOS>
I
do
well
,
sir
,
answered
I.
 
<EOS>
But
this
is
Miss
Goodwin
.
 
<EOS>
Her
mother
chose
that
name
for
her
,
said
he
,
because
she
should
not
be
called
by
her
own
.
  
<EOS>
Well
,
said
I
,
excuse
me
,
sir
;
I
must
go
and
have
a
little
prattle
with
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
send
for
her
in
again
,
replied
he
;
and
in
she
came
in
a
moment
.
 
<EOS>
I
took
her
in
my
arms
,
and
said
,
O
my
charming
dear
!
<EOS>
will
you
love
me
?
 
<EOS>
Will
you
let
me
be
your
aunt
?
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
madam
,
answered
she
,
with
all
my
heart
!
<EOS>
and
I
will
love
you
dearly
:
<EOS>
But
I
must
n't
love
my
uncle
.
<EOS>
Why
so
?
said
he
.
 
<EOS>
Because
,
replied
she
,
you
would
not
speak
to
me
at
first
!
 
<EOS>
And
because
you
would
not
let
me
call
you
uncle
(
for
it
seems
she
was
bid
not
,
that
I
might
not
guess
at
her
presently
)
:
<EOS>
and
yet
,
said
the
pretty
dear
<EOS>
,
I
had
not
seen
you
a
great
while
,
so
I
had
n't
.
  
<EOS>
Well
,
Pamela
,
said
he
,
now
can
you
allow
me
to
love
this
little
innocent
?
<EOS>
Allow
you
,
sir
,
replied
I
;
you
would
be
very
barbarous
,
if
you
did
not
;
and
I
should
be
more
so
,
if
I
did
not
further
it
all
I
could
,
and
love
the
little
lamb
myself
,
for
your
sake
and
for
her
own
sake
;
and
in
compassion
to
her
poor
mother
,
though
unknown
to
me
:
<EOS>
And
tears
stood
in
my
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
Said
he
,
Why
,
my
love
,
are
your
words
so
kind
,
and
your
countenance
so
sad
?
 
<EOS>
I
drew
to
the
window
from
the
child
;
and
said
,
Sad
it
is
not
,
sir
;
but
I
have
a
strange
grief
and
pleasure
mingled
at
once
in
my
breast
,
on
this
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
indeed
a
twofold
grief
,
and
a
twofold
pleasure
.
 
<EOS>
As
how
,
my
dear
?
said
he
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
sir
,
replied
I
,
I
can
not
help
being
grieved
for
the
poor
mother
of
this
sweet
babe
,
to
think
,
if
she
be
living
,
that
she
must
call
her
chiefest
delight
her
shame
:
If
she
be
no
more
,
that
she
must
have
had
such
remorse
on
her
poor
mind
,
when
she
came
to
leave
the
world
,
and
her
little
babe
:
<EOS>
And
,
in
the
second
place
,
I
grieve
,
that
it
must
be
thought
a
kindness
to
the
dear
little
soul
,
not
to
let
her
know
how
near
the
dearest
relation
she
has
in
the
world
is
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
Forgive
me
,
dear
sir
,
I
say
not
this
to
reproach
you
,
in
the
least
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
I
do
n't
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
have
a
twofold
cause
of
joy
;
first
,
That
I
have
had
the
grace
to
escape
the
like
unhappiness
with
this
poor
gentlewoman
:
and
next
,
That
this
discovery
has
given
me
an
opportunity
to
shew
the
sincerity
of
my
grateful
affection
for
you
,
sir
,
in
the
love
I
will
always
express
to
this
dear
child
.
  
<EOS>
And
then
I
stept
to
her
again
,
and
kissed
her
;
and
said
,
Join
with
me
,
my
pretty
love
,
to
beg
your
dear
uncle
to
let
you
come
and
live
with
your
new
aunt
:
<EOS>
Indeed
,
my
little
precious
,
I
'll
love
you
dearly
.
  
<EOS>
Will
you
,
sir
?
said
the
little
charmer
;
will
you
let
me
go
and
live
with
my
aunt
?
  
<EOS>
You
are
very
good
,
my
Pamela
,
said
he
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
have
not
once
been
deceived
in
the
hopes
my
fond
heart
has
entertained
of
your
prudence
.
 
<EOS>
But
will
you
,
sir
?
<EOS>
said
I
;
will
you
grant
me
this
favour
?
 
<EOS>
I
shall
most
sincerely
love
the
little
charmer
;
and
all
I
am
capable
of
doing
for
her
,
both
by
example
and
affection
,
shall
most
cordially
be
done
.
 
<EOS>
My
dearest
sir
,
added
I
,
oblige
me
in
this
thing
!
 
<EOS>
I
think
already
my
heart
is
set
upon
it
!
 
<EOS>
What
a
sweet
employment
and
companionship
shall
I
have
!
  
<EOS>
We
'll
talk
of
this
some
other
time
,
replied
he
;
but
I
must
,
in
prudence
,
put
some
bounds
to
your
amiable
generosity
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
always
intended
to
surprise
you
into
this
discovery
;
but
my
sister
led
the
way
to
it
,
out
of
a
poorness
in
her
spite
,
that
I
could
not
brook
:
<EOS>
And
though
you
have
pleased
me
beyond
expression
,
in
your
behaviour
on
this
occasion
;
yet
I
ca
n't
say
,
that
you
have
gone
much
beyond
my
expectations
;
for
I
have
such
a
high
opinion
of
you
,
that
I
think
nothing
could
have
shaken
it
,
but
a
contrary
conduct
to
this
you
have
expressed
on
so
tender
a
circumstance
.
  
<EOS>
Well
,
sir
,
said
the
dear
little
miss
<EOS>
,
then
you
will
not
let
me
go
home
with
my
aunt
,
will
you
?
 
<EOS>
I
am
sure
she
will
love
me
.
 
<EOS>
When
you
break
up
next
,
my
dear
,
said
he
,
if
you
are
a
good
girl
,
you
shall
pay
your
new
aunt
a
visit
.
 
<EOS>
She
made
a
low
courtesy
.
 
<EOS>
Thank
you
,
sir
,
answered
she
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
my
dear
,
said
I
,
and
I
will
get
you
some
fine
things
against
the
time
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
have
brought
you
some
now
,
had
I
known
I
should
have
seen
my
pretty
love
.
 
<EOS>
Thank
you
,
madam
,
returned
she
.
  
<EOS>
How
old
,
sir
,
said
I
,
is
miss
?
 
<EOS>
Between
six
and
seven
,
answered
he
.
 
<EOS>
Was
she
ever
,
sir
,
said
I
,
at
your
house
?
 
<EOS>
My
sister
,
replied
he
,
carried
her
thither
once
,
as
a
near
relation
of
her
lord
's
.
 
<EOS>
I
remember
,
sir
,
said
I
,
a
little
miss
;
and
Mrs.
Jervis
and
I
took
her
to
be
a
relation
of
Lord
Davers
.
  
<EOS>
My
sister
,
returned
he
,
knew
the
whole
secret
from
the
beginning
;
and
it
made
her
a
great
merit
with
me
,
that
she
kept
it
from
the
knowledge
of
my
father
,
who
was
then
living
,
and
of
my
mother
,
to
her
dying
-
day
;
though
she
descended
so
low
in
her
rage
,
to
hint
the
matter
to
you
.
  
<EOS>
The
little
misses
took
their
leaves
soon
after
:
and
I
know
not
how
,
but
I
am
strangely
affected
with
this
dear
child
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
he
would
be
so
good
as
to
let
me
have
her
home
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
be
a
great
pleasure
to
have
such
a
fine
opportunity
,
obliged
as
I
am
,
to
shew
my
love
for
himself
,
in
my
fondness
for
his
dear
miss
.
  
<EOS>
As
we
came
home
together
in
the
chariot
,
he
gave
me
the
following
particulars
of
this
affair
,
additional
to
what
he
had
before
mentioned
:
  
That
this
lady
was
of
a
good
family
,
and
the
flower
of
it
but
that
her
mother
was
a
person
of
great
art
and
address
,
and
not
altogether
so
nice
in
the
particular
between
himself
and
miss
,
as
she
ought
to
have
been
:
<EOS>
That
,
particularly
,
when
she
had
reason
to
find
him
unsettled
and
wild
,
and
her
daughter
in
more
danger
from
him
,
than
he
was
from
her
,
yet
she
encouraged
their
privacies
;
and
even
,
at
last
,
when
she
had
reason
to
apprehend
,
from
their
being
surprised
together
,
in
a
way
not
so
creditable
to
the
lady
,
that
she
was
far
from
forbidding
their
private
meetings
;
on
the
contrary
,
that
,
on
a
certain
time
,
she
had
set
one
that
had
formerly
been
her
footman
,
and
a
half
-
pay
officer
,
her
relation
,
to
watch
an
opportunity
,
and
to
frighten
him
into
a
marriage
with
the
lady
:
<EOS>
That
,
accordingly
,
when
they
had
surprised
him
in
her
chamber
,
just
as
he
had
been
let
in
,
they
drew
their
swords
upon
him
,
and
threatened
instantly
to
kill
him
,
if
he
did
not
promise
marriage
on
the
spot
;
and
that
they
had
a
parson
ready
below
stairs
,
as
he
found
afterwards
:
<EOS>
That
then
he
suspected
,
from
some
strong
circumstances
,
that
miss
was
in
the
plot
;
which
so
enraged
him
,
with
their
menaces
together
,
that
he
drew
,
and
stood
upon
his
defence
;
and
was
so
much
in
earnest
,
that
the
man
he
pushed
into
the
arm
,
and
disabled
;
and
pressing
pretty
forward
upon
the
other
,
as
he
retreated
,
he
rushed
in
upon
him
near
the
top
of
the
stairs
,
and
pushed
him
down
one
pair
,
and
he
was
much
hurt
by
the
fall
:
<EOS>
Not
but
that
,
he
said
,
he
might
have
paid
for
his
rashness
;
but
that
the
business
of
his
antagonists
was
rather
to
frighten
than
to
kill
him
:
<EOS>
That
,
upon
this
,
in
the
sight
of
the
old
lady
,
the
parson
she
had
provided
,
and
her
other
daughters
,
he
went
out
of
their
house
,
with
bitter
execrations
against
them
all
.
  
<EOS>
That
after
this
,
designing
to
break
off
all
correspondence
with
the
whole
family
,
and
miss
too
,
she
found
means
to
engage
him
to
give
her
a
meeting
at
Woodstock
,
in
order
to
clear
herself
:
<EOS>
That
,
poor
lady
!
<EOS>
she
was
there
obliged
,
naughty
creature
as
he
was
!
<EOS>
to
make
herself
quite
guilty
of
a
worse
fault
,
in
order
to
clear
herself
of
a
lighter
:
That
they
afterwards
met
at
Godstow
often
,
at
Woodstock
,
and
<EOS>
every
neighbouring
place
to
Oxford
,
where
he
was
then
studying
,
as
it
proved
,
guilty
lessons
,
instead
of
improving
ones
;
till
,
at
last
,
the
effect
of
their
frequent
interviews
grew
too
obvious
to
be
concealed
:
That
the
young
lady
then
,
when
she
was
not
fit
to
be
seen
,
for
the
credit
of
the
family
,
was
confined
,
and
all
manner
of
means
were
used
,
to
induce
him
to
marry
her
:
That
,
finding
nothing
would
do
,
they
at
last
resolved
to
complain
to
his
father
and
mother
;
but
that
he
made
his
sister
acquainted
with
the
matter
,
who
then
happened
to
be
at
home
;
and
,
by
her
management
and
spirit
,
their
intentions
of
that
sort
were
frustrated
;
and
,
seeing
no
hopes
,
they
agreed
to
Lady
Davers
's
proposals
,
and
sent
poor
miss
down
to
Marlborough
,
where
,
at
her
expense
,
which
he
answered
to
her
again
,
she
was
provided
for
,
and
privately
lay
-
in
:
That
Lady
Davers
took
upon
herself
the
care
of
the
little
one
,
till
it
came
to
be
fit
to
be
put
to
the
boarding
-
school
,
where
it
now
is
:
And
that
he
had
settled
upon
the
dear
little
miss
such
a
sum
of
money
,
as
the
interest
of
it
would
handsomely
provide
for
her
:
and
the
principal
would
be
a
tolerable
fortune
,
fit
for
a
gentlewoman
,
when
she
came
to
be
marriageable
.
 
<EOS>
And
this
,
my
dear
,
said
he
,
is
the
story
in
brief
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
do
assure
you
,
Pamela
,
<EOS>
added
he
,
I
am
far
from
making
a
boast
of
,
or
taking
a
pride
in
,
this
affair
:
<EOS>
But
since
it
has
happened
,
I
ca
n't
say
<EOS>
but
I
wish
the
poor
child
to
live
,
and
be
happy
;
and
I
must
endeavour
to
make
her
so
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
,
said
I
,
to
be
sure
you
should
;
and
I
shall
take
a
very
great
pride
to
contribute
to
the
dear
little
soul
's
felicity
,
if
you
will
permit
me
to
have
her
home
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
added
I
,
<EOS>
does
miss
know
any
thing
who
are
her
father
and
mother
?
 
<EOS>
I
wanted
him
to
say
if
the
poor
lady
was
living
or
dead
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
answered
he
.
 
<EOS>
Her
governess
has
been
told
,
by
my
sister
,
that
she
is
the
daughter
of
a
gentleman
and
his
lady
,
who
are
related
,
at
a
distance
,
to
Lord
Davers
,
and
now
live
in
Jamaica
;
and
she
calls
me
uncle
,
only
because
I
am
the
brother
to
Lady
Davers
,
whom
she
calls
aunt
,
and
who
is
very
fond
of
her
:
as
is
also
my
lord
,
who
knows
the
whole
matter
;
and
they
have
her
,
at
all
her
little
school
recesses
,
at
their
house
,
and
are
very
kind
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
I
believe
,
added
he
,
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
very
little
known
or
suspected
;
<EOS>
for
,
as
her
mother
is
of
no
mean
family
,
her
friends
endeavour
to
keep
it
secret
,
as
much
as
I
:
and
Lady
Davers
,
till
her
wrath
boiled
over
,
t'other
day
,
has
managed
the
matter
very
dexterously
and
kindly
.
  
<EOS>
The
words
,
mother
is
of
no
mean
family
,
gave
me
not
to
doubt
the
poor
lady
was
living
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
said
,
<EOS>
But
how
,
sir
,
can
the
dear
miss
's
poor
mother
be
content
to
deny
herself
the
enjoyment
of
so
sweet
a
child
?
 
<EOS>
Ah
,
Pamela
,
replied
he
,
now
you
come
in
;
I
see
you
want
to
know
what
's
become
of
the
poor
mother
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
natural
enough
you
should
;
<EOS>
but
I
was
willing
to
see
how
the
little
suspense
would
operate
upon
you
.
 
<EOS>
Dear
sir
,
said
I.
  
Nay
,
replied
he
,
'
tis
very
natural
,
my
dear
!
 
<EOS>
I
think
you
have
had
a
great
deal
of
patience
,
and
are
come
at
this
question
so
fairly
that
you
deserve
to
be
answered
.
  
<EOS>
You
must
know
then
,
there
is
some
foundation
for
saying
,
that
her
mother
,
at
least
,
lives
in
Jamaica
;
for
there
she
does
live
,
and
very
happily
too
.
 
<EOS>
For
I
must
observe
,
that
she
suffered
so
much
in
child
-
bed
,
that
nobody
expected
her
life
;
and
this
<EOS>
,
when
she
was
up
,
made
such
an
impression
upon
her
,
that
she
dreaded
nothing
so
much
as
the
thoughts
of
returning
to
her
former
fault
;
and
,
to
say
the
truth
,
I
had
intended
to
make
her
a
visit
as
soon
as
her
month
was
well
up
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
,
unknown
to
me
,
she
engaged
herself
to
go
to
Jamaica
,
with
two
young
ladies
,
who
were
born
there
;
and
were
returning
to
their
friends
,
after
they
had
been
four
years
in
England
for
their
education
:
and
,
recommending
to
me
,
by
a
very
moving
letter
,
her
little
baby
,
and
that
I
would
not
suffer
it
to
be
called
by
her
name
,
but
Goodwin
,
that
her
shame
might
be
the
less
known
,
for
hers
and
her
family
's
sake
;
she
got
her
friends
to
assign
her
five
hundred
pounds
,
in
full
of
all
her
demands
upon
her
family
,
and
went
up
to
London
,
and
embarked
,
with
her
companions
,
at
Gravesend
,
and
so
sailed
to
Jamaica
;
where
she
is
since
well
and
happily
married
,
passing
to
her
husband
for
a
young
widow
,
with
one
daughter
,
which
her
husband
's
friends
take
care
of
,
and
provide
for
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
you
see
,
Pamela
,
that
in
the
whole
story
on
both
sides
,
the
truth
is
as
much
preserved
as
possible
.
  
<EOS>
Poor
lady
!
<EOS>
said
I
;
how
her
story
moves
me
!
 
<EOS>
I
am
glad
she
is
so
happy
at
last
!
 
<EOS>
And
,
my
dear
,
said
he
,
are
you
not
glad
she
is
so
far
off
too
?
 
<EOS>
As
to
that
,
sir
,
said
I
,
I
can
not
be
sorry
,
to
be
sure
,
as
she
is
so
happy
;
which
she
could
not
have
been
here
.
 
<EOS>
For
,
sir
,
I
doubt
you
would
have
proceeded
with
your
temptations
,
if
she
had
not
gone
;
and
it
shewed
she
was
much
in
earnest
to
be
good
,
that
she
could
leave
her
native
country
,
leave
all
her
relations
,
leave
you
,
whom
she
so
well
loved
,
leave
her
dear
baby
,
and
try
a
new
fortune
,
in
a
new
world
,
among
quite
strangers
,
and
hazard
the
seas
;
and
all
to
preserve
herself
from
further
guiltiness
!
<EOS>
Indeed
,
indeed
,
sir
,
said
I
,
I
bleed
for
what
her
distresses
must
be
,
in
this
case
I
am
grieved
for
her
poor
mind
's
remorse
,
through
her
childbed
terrors
,
which
could
have
so
great
and
so
worthy
an
effect
upon
her
afterwards
;
and
I
honour
her
resolution
;
and
would
rank
such
a
returning
dear
lady
in
the
class
of
those
who
are
most
virtuous
;
and
doubt
not
God
Almighty
's
mercy
to
her
;
and
that
her
present
happiness
is
the
result
of
his
gracious
providence
,
blessing
her
penitence
and
reformation
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
sir
,
said
I
,
did
you
not
once
see
the
poor
lady
after
her
lying
-
in
?
  
<EOS>
I
did
not
believe
her
so
much
in
earnest
,
answered
he
;
and
I
went
down
to
Marlborough
,
and
heard
she
was
gone
from
thence
to
Calne
.
 
<EOS>
I
went
to
Calne
,
and
heard
she
was
gone
to
Reading
,
to
a
relation
's
there
.
 
<EOS>
Thither
I
went
,
and
heard
she
was
gone
to
Oxford
.
 
<EOS>
I
followed
;
and
there
she
was
;
but
I
could
not
see
her
.
  
<EOS>
She
at
last
received
a
letter
from
me
,
begging
a
meeting
with
her
;
for
I
found
her
departure
with
the
ladies
was
resolved
on
,
and
that
she
was
with
her
friends
,
only
to
take
leave
of
them
,
and
receive
her
agreed
on
portion
:
<EOS>
And
she
appointed
the
Saturday
following
,
and
that
was
Wednesday
,
to
give
me
a
meeting
at
the
old
place
,
at
Woodstock
.
  
<EOS>
Then
,
added
he
,
<EOS>
I
thought
I
was
sure
of
her
,
and
doubted
not
I
should
spoil
her
intended
voyage
.
 
<EOS>
I
set
out
on
Thursday
to
Gloucester
,
on
a
party
of
pleasure
;
and
on
Saturday
I
went
to
the
place
appointed
,
at
Woodstock
:
<EOS>
But
when
I
came
thither
,
I
found
a
letter
instead
of
my
lady
;
and
when
I
opened
it
,
it
was
to
beg
my
pardon
for
deceiving
me
;
expressing
her
concern
for
her
past
fault
;
her
affection
for
me
;
and
the
apprehension
she
had
,
that
she
should
be
unable
to
keep
her
good
resolves
,
if
she
met
me
:
that
she
had
set
out
on
the
Thursday
for
her
embarkation
;
for
that
she
feared
nothing
else
could
save
her
;
and
had
appointed
this
meeting
on
Saturday
,
at
the
place
of
her
former
guilt
,
that
I
might
be
suitably
impressed
upon
the
occasion
,
and
pity
and
allow
for
her
;
and
that
she
might
get
three
or
four
days
start
of
me
,
and
be
quite
out
of
my
reach
.
 
<EOS>
She
recommended
again
,
as
upon
the
spot
where
the
poor
little
one
owed
its
being
,
my
tenderness
to
it
,
for
her
sake
;
and
that
was
all
she
had
to
request
of
me
,
she
said
;
but
would
not
forget
to
pray
for
me
in
all
her
own
dangers
,
and
in
every
difficulty
she
was
going
to
encounter
.
  
<EOS>
I
wept
at
this
moving
tale
.
 
<EOS>
And
did
not
this
make
a
deep
impression
upon
you
,
sir
?
<EOS>
said
I.
 
Surely
such
an
affecting
lesson
as
this
,
on
the
very
guilty
spot
too
,
(
<EOS>
I
admire
the
dear
lady
's
pious
contrivance
!
)
<EOS>
must
have
had
a
great
effect
upon
you
.
 
<EOS>
One
would
have
thought
,
sir
,
it
was
enough
to
reclaim
you
for
ever
!
 
<EOS>
All
your
naughty
purposes
<EOS>
,
I
make
no
doubt
,
were
quite
changed
?
  
<EOS>
Why
,
my
dear
,
said
he
,
I
was
much
moved
,
you
may
be
sure
,
when
I
came
to
reflect
:
<EOS>
But
,
at
first
,
I
was
so
assured
of
being
a
successful
tempter
,
and
spoiling
her
voyage
,
that
I
was
vexed
,
and
much
out
of
humour
;
but
when
I
came
to
reflect
,
as
I
said
,
I
was
quite
overcome
with
this
instance
of
her
prudence
,
her
penitence
,
and
her
resolution
;
and
more
admired
her
than
I
ever
had
done
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
I
could
not
bear
<EOS>
she
should
so
escape
me
neither
;
so
much
overcome
me
,
as
it
were
,
in
an
heroical
bravery
;
and
I
hastened
away
,
and
got
a
bill
of
credit
of
Lord
Davers
,
upon
his
banker
in
London
,
for
five
hundred
pounds
;
and
set
out
for
that
place
,
having
called
at
Oxford
,
and
got
what
light
I
could
,
as
to
where
I
might
hear
of
her
there
.
  
<EOS>
When
I
arrived
in
town
,
which
was
not
till
Monday
morning
,
I
went
to
a
place
called
Crosby
-
square
,
where
the
friends
of
the
two
ladies
lived
.
<EOS>
She
had
set
out
in
the
flying
-
coach
on
Tuesday
;
got
to
the
two
ladies
that
very
night
;
and
,
on
Saturday
,
had
set
out
with
them
for
Gravesend
,
much
about
the
time
I
was
expecting
her
at
Woodstock
.
  
<EOS>
You
may
suppose
that
I
was
much
affected
,
my
dear
,
with
this
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
I
got
my
bill
of
credit
converted
into
money
;
and
I
set
out
with
my
servant
on
Monday
afternoon
,
and
reached
Gravesend
that
night
;
and
there
I
understood
that
she
and
the
two
ladies
had
gone
on
board
from
the
very
inn
I
put
up
at
,
in
the
morning
;
and
the
ship
waited
only
for
the
wind
,
which
then
was
turning
about
in
its
favour
.
  
<EOS>
I
got
a
boat
directly
,
and
went
on
board
the
ship
,
and
asked
for
Mrs.
Godfrey
.
 
<EOS>
But
judge
you
,
my
dear
Pamela
,
her
surprise
and
confusion
,
when
she
saw
me
!
 
<EOS>
She
had
like
to
have
fainted
away
.
 
<EOS>
I
offered
any
money
to
put
off
the
sailing
till
next
day
,
but
it
would
not
be
complied
with
;
and
fain
would
I
have
got
her
on
shore
,
and
promised
to
attend
her
,
if
she
would
go
over
land
,
to
any
part
of
England
the
ship
would
touch
at
.
 
<EOS>
But
she
was
immovable
.
  
<EOS>
Every
one
concluded
me
her
humble
servant
,
and
were
touched
at
the
moving
interview
;
the
young
ladies
,
and
their
female
attendants
,
especially
.
<EOS>
With
great
difficulty
,
upon
my
solemn
assurances
of
honour
,
she
trusted
herself
with
me
in
one
of
the
cabins
;
and
there
I
tried
,
what
I
could
,
to
prevail
upon
her
to
quit
her
purpose
;
but
all
in
vain
:
<EOS>
She
said
,
I
had
made
her
quite
unhappy
by
this
interview
!
 
<EOS>
She
had
difficulties
enough
upon
her
mind
before
;
but
now
I
had
embittered
all
her
voyage
,
and
given
her
the
deepest
distress
.
  
<EOS>
I
could
prevail
upon
her
but
for
one
favour
,
and
that
with
the
greatest
reluctance
;
which
was
,
to
accept
of
the
five
hundred
pounds
,
as
a
present
from
me
;
and
she
promised
,
at
my
earnest
desire
,
to
draw
upon
me
for
a
greater
sum
,
as
a
person
that
had
her
effects
in
my
hands
,
when
she
arrived
,
if
she
should
find
it
convenient
for
her
.
 
<EOS>
In
short
,
this
was
all
the
favour
I
could
procure
;
for
she
would
not
promise
so
much
as
to
correspond
with
me
,
and
was
determined
on
going
:
and
,
I
believe
,
if
I
would
have
married
her
,
which
yet
I
had
not
in
my
head
,
she
would
not
have
deviated
from
her
purpose
.
  
<EOS>
But
how
,
sir
,
said
I
<EOS>
,
did
you
part
?
 
<EOS>
I
would
have
sailed
with
her
,
answered
he
,
and
been
landed
at
the
first
port
in
England
or
Ireland
,
I
cared
not
which
,
they
should
put
in
at
;
but
she
was
too
full
of
apprehensions
to
admit
it
;
And
the
rough
fellow
of
a
master
,
captain
they
called
him
,
(
<EOS>
but
,
in
my
mind
,
I
could
have
thrown
him
overboard
,
)
would
not
stay
a
moment
,
the
wind
and
tide
being
quite
fair
;
and
was
very
urgent
with
me
to
go
a
-
shore
,
or
to
go
the
voyage
;
and
being
impetuous
in
my
temper
,
(
spoiled
,
you
know
,
my
dear
,
by
my
mother
,
)
and
not
used
to
control
,
I
thought
it
very
strange
<EOS>
that
wind
or
tide
,
or
any
thing
else
,
should
be
preferred
to
me
and
my
money
:
<EOS>
But
so
it
was
;
I
was
forced
to
go
;
and
so
took
leave
of
the
ladies
,
and
the
other
passengers
;
wished
them
a
good
voyage
;
gave
five
guineas
among
the
ship
's
crew
,
to
be
good
to
the
ladies
,
and
took
such
a
leave
as
you
may
better
imagine
than
I
express
.
 
<EOS>
She
recommended
once
more
to
me
,
the
dear
guest
,
as
she
called
her
,
the
ladies
being
present
;
and
thanked
me
for
all
these
instances
of
my
regard
,
which
,
she
said
,
would
leave
a
strong
impression
on
her
mind
;
and
,
at
parting
,
she
threw
her
arms
about
my
neck
,
and
we
took
such
a
leave
,
as
affected
every
one
present
,
men
,
as
well
as
ladies
.
  
<EOS>
So
,
with
a
truly
heavy
heart
,
I
went
down
the
ship
's
side
to
my
boat
;
and
stood
up
in
it
,
looking
at
her
,
as
long
as
I
could
see
her
,
and
she
at
me
,
with
her
handkerchief
at
her
eyes
;
and
then
I
gazed
at
the
ship
,
till
,
and
after
I
had
landed
,
as
long
as
I
could
discern
the
least
appearance
of
it
;
for
she
was
under
sail
,
in
a
manner
,
when
I
left
her
;
and
so
I
returned
highly
disturbed
to
my
inn
.
  
<EOS>
I
went
to
bed
,
but
rested
not
;
returned
to
London
the
next
morning
;
and
set
out
that
afternoon
again
for
the
country
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
much
,
<EOS>
my
dear
,
for
poor
Sally
Godfrey
.
 
<EOS>
She
sends
,
I
understand
,
by
all
opportunities
,
with
the
knowledge
of
her
husband
,
to
learn
how
her
child
,
by
her
first
husband
,
does
;
and
has
the
satisfaction
to
know
she
is
happily
provided
for
.
 
<EOS>
And
,
about
half
a
year
ago
,
her
spouse
sent
a
little
negro
boy
,
of
about
ten
years
old
,
as
a
present
,
to
wait
upon
her
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
was
taken
ill
of
the
small
-
pox
,
and
died
in
a
month
after
he
was
landed
.
  
<EOS>
Sure
,
sir
,
said
I
,
your
generous
mind
must
have
been
long
affected
with
this
melancholy
case
,
and
all
its
circumstances
.
  
<EOS>
It
hung
upon
me
,
indeed
,
some
time
,
said
he
;
but
I
was
full
of
spirit
and
inconsideration
.
 
<EOS>
I
went
soon
after
to
travel
;
a
hundred
new
objects
danced
before
my
eyes
,
and
kept
reflection
from
me
.
 
<EOS>
And
,
you
see
<EOS>
,
I
had
five
or
six
years
afterwards
,
and
even
before
that
,
so
thoroughly
lost
all
the
impressions
you
talk
of
,
that
I
doubted
not
to
make
my
Pamela
change
her
name
,
without
either
act
of
parliament
,
or
wedlock
,
and
be
Sally
Godfrey
the
second
.
  
<EOS>
O
you
dear
naughty
man
!
<EOS>
said
I
,
this
seems
but
too
true
!
<EOS>
but
I
bless
God
that
it
is
not
so
!
 
<EOS>
I
bless
God
for
your
reformation
,
and
that
for
your
own
dear
sake
,
as
well
as
mine
!
  
<EOS>
Well
,
my
dear
,
said
he
,
and
I
bless
God
for
it
too
!
 
<EOS>
I
do
most
sincerely
!
 
<EOS>
And
'
tis
my
greater
pleasure
,
because
I
have
<EOS>
,
as
I
hoped
,
seen
my
error
so
early
;
and
that
with
such
a
stock
of
youth
and
health
on
my
side
,
in
all
appearance
,
I
can
truly
abhor
my
past
liberties
,
and
pity
poor
Sally
Godfrey
,
from
the
same
motives
that
I
admire
my
Pamela
's
virtues
;
and
resolve
to
make
myself
as
worthy
of
them
as
possible
:
<EOS>
And
I
will
hope
,
my
dear
,
your
prayers
for
my
pardon
,
and
my
perseverance
,
will
be
of
no
small
efficacy
on
this
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
These
agreeable
reflections
,
on
this
melancholy
but
instructive
story
,
brought
us
in
view
of
his
own
house
;
and
we
alighted
,
and
took
a
walk
in
the
garden
till
dinner
was
ready
.
 
<EOS>
And
now
we
are
so
busy
about
making
ready
for
our
appearance
,
that
I
shall
hardly
have
time
to
write
till
that
be
over
.
  
<EOS>
Monday
morning
.
  
<EOS>
Yesterday
we
set
out
,
attended
by
John
,
Abraham
,
Benjamin
,
and
Isaac
,
in
fine
new
liveries
,
in
the
best
chariot
,
which
had
been
new
cleaned
,
and
lined
,
and
new
harnessed
;
so
that
it
looked
like
a
quite
new
one
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
had
no
arms
to
quarter
with
my
dear
lord
and
master
's
;
though
he
jocularly
,
upon
my
taking
notice
of
my
obscurity
,
said
,
that
he
had
a
good
mind
to
have
the
olive
-
branch
,
which
would
allude
to
his
hopes
,
quartered
for
mine
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
dressed
in
the
suit
I
mentioned
,
of
white
flowered
with
silver
,
and
a
rich
head
-
dress
,
and
the
diamond
necklace
,
ear
-
rings
,
etc
.
<EOS>
I
also
mentioned
before
:
<EOS>
And
my
dear
sir
,
in
a
fine
laced
silk
waistcoat
,
of
blue
paduasoy
,
and
his
coat
a
pearl
-
coloured
fine
cloth
,
with
gold
buttons
and
button
-
holes
,
and
lined
with
white
silk
;
and
he
looked
charmingly
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
I
said
,
I
was
too
fine
,
and
would
have
laid
aside
some
of
the
jewels
;
but
he
said
,
It
would
be
thought
a
slight
to
me
from
him
,
as
his
wife
;
and
though
as
I
apprehended
,
it
might
be
,
that
people
would
talk
as
it
was
,
<EOS>
yet
he
had
rather
they
should
say
any
thing
,
than
that
I
was
not
put
upon
an
equal
footing
,
as
his
wife
,
with
any
lady
he
might
have
married
.
  
<EOS>
It
seems
the
neighbouring
gentry
had
expected
us
;
and
there
was
a
great
congregation
;
for
(
against
my
wish
)
we
were
a
little
of
the
latest
;
so
that
,
as
we
walked
up
the
church
to
his
seat
,
we
had
abundance
of
gazers
and
whisperers
:
<EOS>
But
my
dear
master
behaved
with
so
intrepid
an
air
,
and
was
so
cheerful
and
complaisant
to
me
,
that
he
did
credit
to
his
kind
choice
,
instead
of
shewing
as
if
he
was
ashamed
of
it
:
<EOS>
And
as
I
was
resolved
to
busy
my
mind
entirely
with
the
duties
of
the
day
,
my
intentness
on
that
occasion
,
and
my
thankfulness
to
God
,
for
his
unspeakable
mercies
to
me
,
so
took
up
my
thoughts
,
that
I
was
much
less
concerned
,
than
I
should
otherwise
have
been
,
at
the
gazings
and
whisperings
of
the
ladies
and
gentlemen
,
as
well
as
of
the
rest
of
the
congregation
,
whose
eyes
were
all
turned
to
our
seat
.
  
<EOS>
When
the
sermon
was
ended
,
we
staid
the
longer
,
because
the
church
should
be
pretty
empty
;
but
we
found
great
numbers
at
the
church
-
doors
,
and
in
the
church
-
porch
;
and
I
had
the
pleasure
of
hearing
many
commendations
,
as
well
of
my
person
,
as
my
dress
and
behaviour
,
and
not
one
reflection
,
or
mark
of
disrespect
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Martin
,
who
is
single
,
Mr.
Chambers
,
Mr.
Arthur
,
and
Mr.
Brooks
,
with
their
families
,
were
all
there
:
And
the
four
gentlemen
came
up
to
us
,
before
we
went
into
the
chariot
,
and
,
in
a
very
kind
and
respectful
manner
,
complimented
us
both
:
and
Mrs.
Arthur
and
Mrs.
Brooks
were
so
kind
as
to
wish
me
joy
;
and
Mrs.
Brooks
said
,
You
sent
Mr.
Brooks
,
madam
,
home
t'other
day
,
quite
charmed
with
a
manner
,
which
,
you
have
convinced
a
thousand
persons
this
day
,
is
natural
to
you
.
  
<EOS>
You
do
me
great
honour
,
madam
,
replied
I.
 
<EOS>
Such
a
good
lady
's
approbation
must
make
me
too
sensible
of
my
happiness
.
 
<EOS>
My
dear
master
handed
me
into
the
chariot
,
and
stood
talking
with
Sir
Thomas
Atkyns
,
at
the
door
of
it
,
(
who
was
making
him
abundance
of
compliments
,
and
is
a
very
ceremonious
gentleman
,
a
little
too
extreme
in
that
way
,
)
and
,
I
believe
,
to
familiarize
me
to
the
gazers
,
which
concerned
me
a
little
;
for
I
was
dashed
to
hear
the
praises
of
the
countrypeople
,
and
to
see
how
they
crowded
about
the
chariot
.
 
<EOS>
Several
poor
people
begged
my
charity
,
and
I
beckoned
John
with
my
fan
,
and
said
,
Divide
in
the
further
church
-
porch
,
that
money
to
the
poor
,
and
let
them
come
to
-
morrow
morning
to
me
,
and
I
will
give
them
something
more
,
if
they
do
n't
importune
me
now
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
gave
him
all
the
silver
I
had
,
which
happened
to
be
between
twenty
and
thirty
shillings
;
and
this
drew
away
from
me
their
clamorous
prayers
for
charity
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Martin
came
up
to
me
on
the
other
side
of
the
chariot
,
and
leaned
on
the
very
door
,
while
my
master
was
talking
to
Sir
Thomas
,
from
whom
he
could
not
get
away
;
and
said
,
By
all
that
's
good
,
you
have
charmed
the
whole
congregation
!
 
<EOS>
Not
a
soul
but
is
full
of
your
praises
!
 
<EOS>
My
neighbour
knew
,
better
than
any
body
could
tell
him
,
how
to
choose
for
himself
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
said
he
,
the
dean
himself
looked
more
upon
you
than
his
book
.
  
<EOS>
O
sir
,
said
I
,
you
are
very
encouraging
to
a
weak
mind
!
 
<EOS>
I
vow
<EOS>
,
said
he
,
I
say
no
more
than
is
truth
:
I
'd
marry
to
-
morrow
,
if
I
was
sure
of
meeting
with
a
person
of
<EOS>
but
one
-
half
the
merit
you
have
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
,
continued
he
,
and
'
tis
not
my
way
to
praise
too
much
,
an
ornament
to
your
sex
,
an
honour
to
your
spouse
,
and
a
credit
to
religion
.
 
<EOS>
Every
body
is
saying
so
,
added
he
;
for
you
have
,
by
your
piety
,
edified
the
whole
church
.
  
<EOS>
As
he
had
done
speaking
,
the
dean
himself
complimented
me
,
that
the
behaviour
of
so
worthy
a
lady
,
would
be
very
edifying
to
his
congregation
,
and
encouraging
to
himself
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
said
I
,
you
are
very
kind
<EOS>
:
I
hope
I
shall
not
behave
unworthy
of
the
good
instructions
I
shall
have
the
pleasure
to
receive
from
so
worthy
a
divine
.
 
<EOS>
He
bowed
,
and
went
on
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Thomas
then
applied
to
me
,
my
master
stepping
into
the
chariot
,
and
said
,
I
beg
pardon
,
madam
,
for
detaining
your
good
spouse
from
you
:
<EOS>
but
I
have
been
saying
,
he
is
the
happiest
man
in
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
I
bowed
to
him
,
but
I
could
have
wished
him
further
,
to
make
me
sit
so
in
the
notice
of
every
one
;
which
,
for
all
I
could
do
,
dashed
me
not
a
little
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Martin
said
to
my
master
,
If
you
'll
come
to
church
every
Sunday
with
your
charming
lady
,
I
will
never
absent
myself
,
and
she
'll
give
a
good
example
to
all
the
neighbourhood
.
 
<EOS>
O
,
my
dear
sir
!
<EOS>
said
I
to
my
master
,
you
know
not
how
much
I
am
obliged
to
good
Mr.
Martin
!
 
<EOS>
He
has
,
by
his
kind
expressions
,
made
me
dare
to
look
up
with
pleasure
and
gratitude
.
  
<EOS>
Said
my
master
,
My
dear
love
,
I
am
very
much
obliged
,
as
well
as
you
,
to
my
good
friend
Mr.
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
And
he
said
to
him
,
We
will
constantly
go
to
church
,
and
to
every
other
place
,
where
we
can
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
Mr.
Martin
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Martin
said
,
Gad
,
sir
,
you
are
a
happy
man
;
and
I
think
your
lady
's
example
has
made
you
more
polite
and
handsome
too
,
than
I
ever
knew
you
before
,
though
we
never
thought
you
unpolite
,
neither
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
he
bowed
,
and
went
to
his
own
chariot
;
and
,
as
we
drove
away
,
the
people
kindly
blessed
us
,
and
called
us
a
charming
pair
.
  
<EOS>
As
I
have
no
other
pride
,
I
hope
,
in
repeating
these
things
,
than
in
the
countenance
the
general
approbation
gives
to
my
dear
master
,
for
his
stooping
so
low
,
you
will
excuse
me
for
it
,
I
know
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
afternoon
we
went
again
to
church
,
and
a
little
early
,
at
my
request
;
but
the
church
was
quite
full
,
and
soon
after
even
crowded
;
so
much
does
novelty
(
the
more
's
the

Mr.
Martin
came
in
after
us
,
and
made
up
to
our
seat
;
and
said
,
If
you
please
,
my
dear
friend
,
I
will
take
my
seat
with
you
this
afternoon
.
<EOS>
With
all
my
heart
,
said
my
master
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
sorry
for
it
;
but
was
resolved
my
duty
should
not
be
made
second
to
bashfulness
,
or
any
other
consideration
;
and
when
divine
service
began
,
I
withdrew
to
the
farther
end
of
the
pew
,
and
left
the
gentlemen
in
the
front
,
and
they
behaved
quite
suitably
,
both
of
them
,
to
the
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
I
mention
this
the
rather
,
because
Mr.
Martin
was
not
very
noted
for
coming
to
church
,
or
attention
when
there
,
before
.
  
<EOS>
The
dean
preached
again
,
which
he
was
not
used
to
do
,
out
of
compliment
to
us
;
and
an
excellent
sermon
he
made
on
the
relative
duties
of
Christianity
:
<EOS>
And
it
took
my
particular
attention
;
for
he
made
many
fine
observations
on
the
subject
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Martin
addressed
himself
twice
or
thrice
to
me
,
during
the
sermon
;
but
he
saw
me
so
wholly
engrossed
with
hearkening
to
the
good
preacher
,
that
he
forbore
interrupting
me
;
yet
I
took
care
,
according
to
the
lessons
formerly
given
me
,
to
observe
to
him
a
cheerful
and
obliging
behaviour
,
as
one
of
Mr.
B
#
#
#
#
's
friends
and
intimates
.
 
<EOS>
My
master
asked
him
to
give
him
his
company
to
supper
;
and
he
said
,
I
am
so
taken
with
your
lady
,
that
you
must
not
give
me
too
much
encouragement
;
for
I
shall
be
always
with
you
,
if
you
do
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
pleased
to
say
<EOS>
,
You
can
not
favour
us
with
too
much
of
your
company
;
and
as
I
have
left
you
in
the
lurch
in
your
single
state
,
I
think
you
will
do
well
to
oblige
us
as
much
as
you
can
;
and
who
knows
but
my
happiness
may
reform
another
rake
?
 
<EOS>
Who
knows
?
<EOS>
said
Mr.
Martin
:
<EOS>
Why
,
I
know
;
for
I
am
more
than
half
reformed
already
.
  
<EOS>
At
the
chariot
door
,
Mrs.
Arthur
,
Mrs.
Brooks
,
and
Mrs.
Chambers
,
were
brought
to
me
,
by
their
respective
spouses
;
and
presently
the
witty
Lady
Towers
,
who
bantered
me
before
,
(
as
I
once
told
you
,
)
joined
them
;
and
Mrs.
Arthur
said
,
she
wished
me
joy
;
and
that
all
the
good
ladies
,
my
neighbours
,
would
collect
themselves
together
,
and
make
me
a
visit
.
<EOS>
This
,
said
I
,
will
be
an
honour
,
madam
,
that
I
can
never
enough
acknowledge
.
 
<EOS>
It
will
be
very
kind
so
to
countenance
a
person
who
will
always
study
to
deserve
your
favour
,
by
the
most
respectful
behaviour
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Towers
said
,
My
dear
neighbour
,
you
want
no
countenance
;
your
own
merit
is
sufficient
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
a
slight
cold
,
that
kept
me
at
home
in
the
morning
;
but
I
heard
you
so
much
talked
of
,
and
praised
,
that
I
resolved
not
to
stay
away
in
the
afternoon
;
and
I
join
in
the
joy
every
one
gives
you
.
 
<EOS>
She
turned
to
my
master
,
and
said
,
You
are
a
sly
thief
,
as
I
always
thought
you
.
 
<EOS>
Where
have
you
stolen
this
lady
?
 
<EOS>
And
now
,
how
barbarous
is
it
,
thus
unawares
,
in
a
manner
,
to
bring
her
here
upon
us
,
to
mortify
and
eclipse
us
all
?
 
<EOS>
You
are
very
kind
,
madam
,
said
he
,
that
you
and
all
my
worthy
neighbours
see
with
my
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
But
had
I
not
known
she
had
so
much
excellency
of
mind
and
behaviour
,
as
would
strike
every
body
in
her
favour
at
first
sight
<EOS>
,
I
should
not
have
dared
to
class
her
with
such
of
my
worthy
neighbours
,
as
now
so
kindly
congratulate
us
both
.
  
<EOS>
I
own
,
said
she
,
<EOS>
softly
,
I
was
one
of
your
censurers
;
but
I
never
liked
you
so
well
in
my
life
,
as
for
this
action
<EOS>
,
now
I
see
how
capable
your
bride
is
of
giving
distinction
to
any
condition
.
 
<EOS>
And
,
coming
to
me
,
My
dear
neighbour
,
said
she
,
excuse
me
for
having
but
in
my
thought
,
the
remembrance
that
I
have
seen
you
formerly
,
when
,
by
your
sweet
air
and
easy
deportment
,
you
so
much
surpass
us
all
,
and
give
credit
to
your
present
happy
condition
.
  
<EOS>
Dear
good
madam
,
said
I
,
how
shall
I
suitably
return
my
acknowledgments
!
<EOS>
But
it
will
never
be
a
pain
to
me
to
look
back
upon
my
former
days
,
now
I
have
the
kind
allowance
and
example
of
so
many
worthy
ladies
to
support
me
in
the
honours
to
which
the
most
generous
of
men
has
raised
me
.
  
<EOS>
Sweetly
said
!
<EOS>
she
was
pleased
to
say
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
was
in
another
place
,
I
would
kiss
you
for
that
answer
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
happy
,
happy
Mr.
B
#
#
#
#
!
said
she
to
my
master
;
what
reputation
have
you
not
brought
upon
your
judgment
!
 
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
be
long
before
I
see
you
,
added
she
,
<EOS>
I
'll
assure
you
,
if
I
come
by
myself
.
 
<EOS>
That
shall
be
your
own
fault
,
madam
,
said
Mrs.
Brooks
.
  
<EOS>
And
so
they
took
leave
;
and
I
gave
my
hand
to
my
dear
master
,
and
said
,
How
happy
have
you
made
me
,
generous
sir
!
 
<EOS>
And
the
dean
,
who
had
just
come
up
,
heard
me
,
and
said
,
<EOS>
And
how
happy
you
have
made
your
spouse
,
I
'll
venture
to
pronounce
,
is
hard
to
say
,
from
what
I
observe
of
you
both
.
 
<EOS>
I
courtesied
,
and
blushed
,
not
thinking
any
body
heard
me
.
 
<EOS>
And
my
master
telling
him
he
should
be
glad
of
the
honour
of
a
visit
from
him
<EOS>
;
he
said
,
He
would
pay
his
respects
to
us
the
first
opportunity
,
and
bring
his
wife
and
daughter
to
attend
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
said
,
<EOS>
That
was
doubly
kind
;
and
I
should
be
very
proud
of
cultivating
so
worthy
an
acquaintance
.
 
<EOS>
I
thanked
him
for
his
kind
discourse
;
and
he
thanked
me
for
my
attention
,
which
he
called
exemplary
:
<EOS>
and
so
my
dear
master
handed
me
into
the
chariot
;
and
we
were
carried
home
,
both
happy
,
and
both
pleased
,
thank
God
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Martin
came
in
the
evening
,
with
another
gentleman
,
his
friend
,
one
Mr.
Dormer
;
and
he
entertained
us
with
the
favourable
opinion
,
he
said
,
every
one
had
of
me
,
and
of
the
choice
my
good
benefactor
had
made
.
  
<EOS>
This
morning
the
poor
came
,
according
to
my
invitation
;
and
I
sent
them
away
with
glad
hearts
to
the
number
of
twenty
-
five
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
not
above
twelve
or
fourteen
on
Sunday
,
that
John
divided
the
silver
among
,
which
I
gave
him
for
that
purpose
;
but
others
got
hold
of
the
matter
,
and
made
up
to
the
above
number
.
  
<EOS>
Tuesday
.
  
<EOS>
My
generous
master
has
given
me
,
this
morning
,
a
most
considerate
,
but
yet
,
from
the
nature
of
it
,
melancholy
instance
of
his
great
regard
for
my
unworthiness
,
which
I
never
could
have
wished
,
hoped
for
,
or
even
thought
of
.
  
<EOS>
He
took
a
walk
with
me
,
after
breakfast
,
into
the
garden
;
and
a
little
shower
falling
,
he
led
me
,
for
shelter
,
into
the
little
summer
-
house
,
in
the
private
garden
,
where
he
formerly
gave
me
apprehensions
;
and
,
sitting
down
by
me
,
he
said
,
I
have
now
finished
all
that
lies
on
my
mind
,
my
dear
,
and
am
very
easy
:
<EOS>
For
have
you
not
wondered
,
that
I
have
so
much
employed
myself
in
my
library
?
 
<EOS>
Been
so
much
at
home
,
and
yet
not
in
your
company
?
 
<EOS>
No
,
sir
,
said
I
;
I
have
never
been
so
impertinent
as
to
wonder
at
any
thing
you
please
to
employ
yourself
about
;
nor
would
give
way
to
a
curiosity
that
should
be
troublesome
to
you
:
<EOS>
And
,
besides
,
I
know
your
large
possessions
;
and
the
method
you
take
of
looking
yourself
into
your
affairs
,
must
needs
take
up
so
much
of
your
time
,
that
I
ought
to
be
very
careful
how
I
intrude
upon
you
.
  
<EOS>
Well
,
said
he
,
but
I
'll
tell
you
what
has
been
my
last
work
I
have
taken
it
into
my
consideration
,
that
,
at
present
,
my
line
is
almost
extinct
;
and
that
the
chief
part
of
my
maternal
estate
,
in
case
I
die
without
issue
,
will
go
to
another
line
,
and
great
part
of
my
personal
will
fall
into
such
hands
,
as
I
shall
not
care
my
Pamela
<EOS>
should
he
at
the
mercy
of
.
<EOS>
I
have
,
therefore
,
as
human
life
is
uncertain
,
made
such
a
disposition
of
my
affairs
,
as
will
make
you
absolutely
independent
and
happy
;
as
will
secure
to
you
the
power
of
doing
a
great
deal
of
good
,
and
living
as
a
person
ought
to
do
,
who
is
my
relict
;
and
shall
put
it
out
of
any
body
's
power
to
molest
your
father
and
mother
,
in
the
provision
I
design
them
,
for
the
remainder
of
their
days
:
<EOS>
And
I
have
finished
all
this
very
morning
,
except
to
naming
trustees
for
you
;
and
if
you
have
any
body
you
would
confide
in
more
than
another
,
I
would
have
you
speak
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
so
touched
with
this
mournful
instance
of
his
excessive
goodness
to
me
,
and
<EOS>
the
thoughts
necessarily
flowing
from
the
solemn
occasion
,
that
I
was
unable
to
speak
;
and
at
last
relieved
my
mind
by
a
violent
fit
of
weeping
;
and
could
only
say
,
clasping
my
arms
around
the
dear
generous
man
,
How
shall
I
support
this
!
 
<EOS>
So
very
cruel
,
yet
so
very
kind
!
  
<EOS>
Do
n't
,
my
dear
,
said
he
,
be
concerned
at
what
gives
me
pleasure
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
the
nearer
<EOS>
my
end
,
for
having
made
this
disposition
;
but
I
think
the
putting
off
these
material
points
,
when
so
many
accidents
every
day
happen
,
and
life
is
so
precarious
,
is
one
of
the
most
inexcusable
things
in
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
And
there
are
many
important
points
to
be
thought
of
,
when
life
is
drawing
to
its
utmost
verge
;
and
the
mind
may
be
so
agitated
and
unfit
,
that
it
is
a
most
sad
thing
to
put
off
,
to
that
time
,
any
of
those
concerns
,
which
more
especially
require
a
considerate
and
composed
frame
of
temper
,
and
perfect
health
and
vigour
,
to
give
directions
about
.
 
<EOS>
My
poor
friend
,
Mr.
Carlton
,
who
died
in
my
arms
so
lately
;
and
had
a
mind
disturbed
by
worldly
considerations
on
one
side
;
a
weakness
of
body
,
through
the
violence
of
his
distemper
,
on
another
;
and
the
concerns
of
still
as
much
more
moment
,
as
the
soul
is
to
the
body
,
on
a
third
;
made
so
great
an
impression
upon
me
then
,
that
I
was
the
more
impatient
to
come
to
this
house
,
where
were
most
of
my
writings
,
in
order
to
make
the
disposition
I
have
now
perfected
:
And
since
it
is
grievous
to
my
dear
girl
,
I
will
myself
think
of
such
trustees
as
shall
be
most
for
her
benefit
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
only
,
therefore
,
to
assure
you
,
my
dear
,
that
in
this
instance
,
as
I
will
do
in
any
other
I
can
think
of
,
I
have
studied
to
make
you
quite
easy
,
free
,
and
independent
.
 
<EOS>
And
because
I
shall
avoid
all
occasions
,
for
the
future
,
which
may
discompose
you
,
I
have
<EOS>
but
one
request
to
make
;
which
is
,
that
if
it
please
God
,
for
my
sins
,
to
separate
me
from
my
dearest
Pamela
,
you
will
only
resolve
not
to
marry
one
person
;
for
I
would
not
be
such
a
Herod
,
as
to
restrain
you
from
a
change
of
condition
with
any
other
,
however
reluctantly
I
may
think
of
any
other
person
's
succeeding
me
in
your
esteem
.
  
<EOS>
I
could
not
answer
,
and
thought
my
heart
would
have
burst
:
<EOS>
And
he
continued
,
<EOS>
To
conclude
at
once
a
subject
that
is
so
grievous
to
you
,
I
will
tell
you
,
my
Pamela
,
that
this
person
is
Mr.
Williams
.
 
<EOS>
And
now
I
will
acquaint
you
with
my
motive
for
this
request
;
which
is
wholly
owing
to
my
niceness
,
and
to
no
dislike
I
have
for
him
,
or
apprehension
of
any
likelihood
that
it
will
be
so
:
but
,
methinks
it
would
reflect
a
little
upon
my
Pamela
,
if
she
was
to
give
way
to
such
a
conduct
,
as
if
she
had
married
a
man
for
his
estate
,
when
she
had
rather
have
had
another
,
had
it
not
been
for
that
;
and
that
now
,
the
world
will
say
,
she
is
at
liberty
to
pursue
her
inclination
,
the
parson
is
the
man
!
 
<EOS>
And
I
can
not
bear
even
the
most
distant
apprehension
,
that
I
had
not
the
preference
with
you
,
of
any
man
living
,
let
me
have
been
what
I
would
,
as
I
have
shewn
my
dear
life
,
that
I
have
preferred
her
to
all
her
sex
,
of
whatever
degree
.
  
<EOS>
I
could
not
speak
,
might
I
have
had
the
world
;
and
he
took
me
in
his
arms
,
and
said
,
I
have
now
spoken
all
my
mind
,
and
expect
no
answer
;
and
I
see
you
too
much
moved
to
give
me
one
.
 
<EOS>
Only
forgive
me
the
mention
,
since
I
have
told
you
my
motive
;
which
as
much
affects
your
reputation
,
as
my
niceness
;
and
offer
not
at
an
answer
;
 
<EOS>
only
say
,
you
forgive
me
:
<EOS>
And
I
hope
I
have
not
one
discomposing
thing
to
say
to
my
dearest
,
for
the
rest
of
my
life
;
which
I
pray
God
,
for
both
our
sakes
,
to
lengthen
for
many
happy
years
.
  
<EOS>
Grief
still
choaked
up
the
passage
of
my
words
;
and
he
said
,
The
shower
is
over
,
my
dear
:
<EOS>
let
us
walk
out
again
.
 
<EOS>
He
led
me
out
,
and
I
would
have
spoken
;
but
he
said
,
I
will
not
hear
my
dear
creature
say
any
thing
!
 
<EOS>
To
hearken
to
your
assurance
of
complying
with
my
request
,
would
look
as
if
I
doubted
you
,
and
wanted
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
confident
I
needed
only
to
speak
my
mind
,
to
be
observed
by
you
;
and
I
shall
never
more
think
on
the
subject
,
if
you
do
n't
remind
me
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
most
sweetly
changed
the
discourse
.
  
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
with
pleasure
,
my
dear
,
said
he
,
take
in
the
delightful
fragrance
that
this
sweet
shower
has
given
to
these
banks
of
flowers
?
<EOS>
Your
presence
is
so
enlivening
to
me
,
that
I
could
almost
fancy
,
that
what
we
owe
to
the
shower
,
is
owing
to
that
:
And
all
nature
,
methinks
,
blooms
around
me
when
I
have
my
Pamela
by
my
side
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
a
poetess
,
my
dear
;
and
I
will
give
you
a
few
lines
,
that
I
made
myself
on
such
an
occasion
as
this
I
am
speaking
of
,
the
presence
of
a
sweet
companion
,
and
the
fresh
verdure
,
that
,
after
a
shower
,
succeeding
a
long
drought
,
shewed
itself
throughout
all
vegetable
nature
.
 
<EOS>
And
then
,
in
a
sweet
and
easy
accent
,
(
with
his
dear
arms
about
me
as
we
walked
,
)
he
sung
me
the
following
verses
;
of
which
he
afterwards
favoured
me
with
a
copy
:
                    
I.
      
<EOS>
All
nature
blooms
when
you
appear
;
    
<EOS>
The
fields
their
richest
liv'ries
wear
;
    
Oaks
,
elms
,
and
pines
,
blest
with
your
view
,
    
Shoot
out
fresh
greens
,
and
bud
anew
.
      
<EOS>
The
varying
seasons
you
supply
;
      
<EOS>
And
,
when
you
're
gone
,
they
fade
and
die
.

<EOS>
Sweet
Philomel
,
in
mournful
strains
,
    
To
you
appeals
,
to
you
complains
.
    
<EOS>
The
tow'ring
lark
,
on
rising
wing
,
    
Warbles
to
you
,
your
praise
does
sing
;
      
He
cuts
the
yielding
air
,
and
flies
      
To
heav'n
,
to
type
your
future
joys
.

<EOS>
The
purple
violet
<EOS>
,
damask
rose
,
    
<EOS>
Each
,
to
delight
your
senses
,
blows
.
    
<EOS>
The
lilies
ope
'
,
as
you
appear
;
    
And
all
the
beauties
of
the
year
      
Diffuse
their
odours
at
your
feet
,
      
<EOS>
Who
give
to
ev'ry
flow'r
<EOS>
its
sweet
.
                   
<EOS>
IV
.
      
<EOS>
For
flow'rs
and
women
are
allied
;
    
Both
,
nature
's
glory
,
and
her
pride
!
    
<EOS>
Of
ev'ry
fragrant
sweet
possest
,
    
They
bloom
but
for
the
fair
one
's
breast
,
      
And
to
the
swelling
bosom
borne
,
      
Each
other
mutually
adorn
.
  
<EOS>
Thus
sweetly
did
he
palliate
the
woes
,
which
the
generosity
of
his
actions
,
mixed
with
the
solemness
of
the
occasion
,
and
the
strange
request
he
had
vouchsafed
to
make
me
,
had
occasioned
.
 
<EOS>
And
all
he
would
permit
me
to
say
,
was
,
that
I
was
not
displeased
with
him
!
 
<EOS>
Displeased
with
you
,
dearest
sir
!
<EOS>
said
I
:
Let
me
thus
testify
my
obligations
,
and
the
force
all
your
commands
shall
have
upon
me
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
took
the
liberty
to
clasp
my
arms
about
his
neck
,
and
kissed
him
.
  
<EOS>
But
yet
my
mind
was
pained
at
times
,
and
has
been
to
this
hour
.
 
<EOS>
God
grant
that
I
may
never
see
the
dreadful
moment
,
that
shall
shut
up
the
precious
life
of
this
excellent
,
generous
benefactor
of
mine
!
 
<EOS>
And
 
<EOS>
but
I
can
not
bear
to
suppose
 
I
can
not
say
more
on
such
a
deep
subject
.
  
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
what
a
poor
thing
is
human
life
in
its
best
enjoyments
!
<EOS>
subjected
to
imaginary
evils
,
when
it
has
no
real
ones
to
disturb
it
;
and
that
can
be
made
as
effectually
unhappy
by
its
apprehensions
of
remote
contingencies
,
as
if
it
was
struggling
with
the
pangs
of
a
present
distress
!
 
<EOS>
This
,
duly
reflected
upon
,
methinks
,
should
convince
every
one
,
that
this
world
is
not
a
place
for
the
immortal
mind
to
be
confined
to
;
and
that
there
must
be
an
hereafter
,
where
the
whole
soul
shall
be
satisfied
.
  
<EOS>
But
I
shall
get
out
of
my
depth
;
my
shallow
mind
can
not
comprehend
,
as
it
ought
,
these
weighty
subjects
:
<EOS>
Let
me
only
therefore
pray
,
that
,
after
having
made
a
grateful
use
of
God
's
mercies
here
,
I
may
,
with
my
dear
benefactor
,
rejoice
in
that
happy
state
,
where
is
no
mixture
,
no
unsatisfiedness
;
and
where
all
is
joy
,
and
peace
,
and
love
,
for
evermore
!
  
<EOS>
I
said
,
when
we
sat
at
supper
,
The
charming
taste
you
gave
me
,
sir
,
of
your
poetical
fancy
,
makes
me
sure
you
have
more
favours
of
this
kind
to
delight
me
with
,
if
you
please
;
and
may
I
beg
to
be
indulged
on
this
agreeable
head
?
 
<EOS>
Hitherto
,
said
he
,
my
life
has
been
too
much
a
life
of
gayety
and
action
,
to
be
busied
so
innocently
.
 
<EOS>
Some
little
essays
I
have
now
and
then
attempted
;
but
very
few
<EOS>
have
I
completed
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
I
had
not
patience
nor
attention
enough
to
hold
me
long
to
any
one
thing
.
 
<EOS>
Now
<EOS>
and
then
,
perhaps
,
I
may
occasionally
shew
you
what
I
have
essayed
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
never
could
please
myself
in
this
way
.
  
<EOS>
Friday
.
  
<EOS>
We
were
yesterday
favoured
with
the
company
of
almost
all
the
neighbouring
gentlemen
and
their
ladies
,
who
,
by
appointment
with
one
another
,
met
to
congratulate
our
happiness
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
could
be
more
obliging
,
more
free
and
affectionate
,
than
the
ladies
;
nothing
more
polite
than
the
gentlemen
.
 
<EOS>
All
was
performed
(
for
they
came
to
supper
)
with
decency
and
order
,
and
much
to
every
one
's
satisfaction
;
which
was
principally
owing
to
good
Mrs.
Jervis
's
care
and
skill
;
who
is
an
excellent
manager
.
  
<EOS>
For
my
part
,
I
was
dressed
out
only
to
be
admired
,
as
it
seems
:
and
truly
,
if
I
had
not
known
,
that
I
did
not
make
myself
,
as
you
,
my
dear
father
,
once
hinted
to
me
,
and
if
I
had
had
the
vanity
to
think
as
well
of
myself
,
as
the
good
company
was
pleased
to
do
,
I
might
possibly
have
been
proud
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
know
,
as
my
Lady
Davers
said
,
though
in
anger
,
yet
in
truth
,
that
I
am
but
a
poor
bit
of
painted
dirt
.
 
<EOS>
All
that
I
value
myself
upon
,
is
,
that
God
has
raised
me
to
a
condition
to
be
useful
,
in
my
generation
,
to
better
persons
than
myself
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
my
pride
:
<EOS>
And
I
hope
this
will
be
all
my
pride
.
 
<EOS>
For
what
was
I
of
myself
!
 
<EOS>
All
the
good
I
can
do
,
is
but
a
poor
third
-
hand
good
;
for
my
dearest
master
himself
is
but
the
second
-
hand
.
 
<EOS>
God
,
the
all
-
gracious
,
the
all
-
good
,
the
all
-
bountiful
,
the
all
-
mighty
,
the
all
-
merciful
God
,
is
the
first
:
To
him
,
therefore
,
be
all
the
glory
!
  
<EOS>
As
I
expect
the
happiness
,
the
unspeakable
happiness
,
my
ever
-
dear
and
ever
-
honoured
father
and
mother
,
of
enjoying
you
both
here
,
under
this
roof
,
so
soon
,
(
and
pray
let
it
be
as
soon
as
you
can
,
)
I
will
not
enter
into
the
particulars
of
the
last
agreeable
evening
:
<EOS>
For
I
shall
have
a
thousand
things
,
as
well
as
that
,
to
talk
to
you
upon
.
 
<EOS>
I
fear
you
will
be
tired
with
my
prattle
when
I
see
you
!
  
<EOS>
I
am
to
return
these
visits
singly
;
and
there
were
eight
ladies
here
of
different
families
.
 
<EOS>
Dear
heart
!
<EOS>
I
shall
find
enough
to
do
!
 
<EOS>
I
doubt
my
time
will
not
be
so
well
filled
up
,
as
I
once
promised
my
dear
master
!
  
<EOS>
But
he
is
pleased
,
cheerful
,
kind
,
affectionate
!
 
<EOS>
O
what
a
happy
creature
am
I
!
 
<EOS>
May
I
be
always
thankful
to
God
,
and
grateful
to
him
!
  
<EOS>
When
all
these
tumultuous
visitings
are
over
,
I
shall
have
my
mind
<EOS>
,
I
hope
,
subside
into
a
family
calm
,
that
I
may
make
myself
a
little
useful
to
the
household
of
my
dear
master
;
or
else
I
shall
be
an
unprofitable
servant
indeed
!
  
<EOS>
Lady
Davers
sent
this
morning
her
compliments
to
us
both
,
very
affectionately
;
and
her
lord
's
good
wishes
and
congratulations
:
and
she
desired
my
writings
per
bearer
;
and
says
,
she
will
herself
bring
them
to
me
again
,
with
thanks
,
as
soon
as
she
has
read
them
;
and
she
and
her
lord
will
come
and
be
my
guests
(
that
was
her
particularly
kind
word
)
for
a
fortnight
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
now
<EOS>
but
one
thing
to
wish
for
;
and
then
,
methinks
,
I
shall
be
all
ecstasy
:
and
that
is
,
your
presence
,
both
of
you
,
and
your
blessings
;
<EOS>
which
I
hope
you
will
bestow
upon
me
every
morning
and
night
,
till
you
are
settled
in
the
happy
manner
my
dear
Mr.
B
#
#
#
#
has
intended
.
  
<EOS>
Methinks
I
want
sadly
your
list
of
the
honest
and
worthy
poor
;
for
the
money
lies
by
me
,
and
brings
me
no
interest
.
 
<EOS>
You
see
I
am
become
a
mere
usurer
;
and
want
to
make
use
upon
use
:
and
yet
,
when
I
have
done
all
,
I
can
not
do
so
much
as
I
ought
.
 
<EOS>
God
forgive
my
imperfections
!
  
<EOS>
I
tell
my
dear
spouse
,
I
want
another
dairy
-
house
visit
.
 
<EOS>
To
be
sure
,
if
he
wo
n't
,
at
present
,
permit
it
<EOS>
,
I
shall
,
if
it
please
God
to
spare
us
,
tease
him
like
any
over
-
indulged
wife
,
if
,
as
the
dear
charmer
grows
older
,
he
wo
n't
let
me
have
the
pleasure
of
forming
her
tender
mind
,
as
well
as
I
am
able
;
lest
,
poor
little
soul
<EOS>
,
she
fall
into
such
snares
,
as
her
unhappy
dear
mother
fell
into
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
providing
a
power
of
pretty
things
for
her
,
against
<EOS>
I
see
her
next
,
that
I
may
make
her
love
me
,
if
I
can
.
  
<EOS>
Just
now
I
have
the
blessed
news
,
that
you
will
set
out
for
this
happy
house
on
Tuesday
morning
.
 
<EOS>
The
chariot
shall
be
with
you
without
fail
.
<EOS>
God
give
us
a
happy
meeting
!
 
<EOS>
O
how
I
long
for
it
!
 
<EOS>
Forgive
your
impatient
daughter
,
who
sends
this
to
amuse
you
on
your
journey
;
and
desires
to
be
                       
Ever
most
dutifully
yours
.
  
<EOS>
Here
end
,
at
present
,
the
letters
of
Pamela
to
her
father
and
mother
.
<EOS>
They
arrived
at
their
daughter
's
house
on
Tuesday
evening
in
the
following
week
,
and
were
received
by
her
with
the
utmost
joy
and
duty
;
and
with
great
goodness
and
complaisance
by
Mr.
B
#
#
#
#
.
 
<EOS>
And
having
resided
there
till
every
thing
was
put
in
order
for
them
at
the
Kentish
estate
,
they
were
carried
down
thither
by
himself
,
and
their
daughter
,
and
put
into
possession
of
the
pretty
farm
he
had
designed
for
them
.
  
<EOS>
The
reader
will
here
indulge
us
in
a
few
brief
observations
,
which
naturally
result
from
the
story
and
characters
;
and
which
will
serve
as
so
many
applications
of
its
most
material
incidents
to
the
minds
of
YOUTH
of
BOTH
SEXES
.
  
<EOS>
First
,
then
,
in
the
character
of
the
GENTLEMAN
,
may
be
seen
that
of
a
fashionable
libertine
,
who
allowed
himself
in
the
free
indulgence
of
his
passions
,
especially
to
the
fair
sex
;
and
found
himself
supported
in
his
daring
attempts
,
by
an
affluent
fortune
in
possession
,
a
personal
bravery
,
as
it
is
called
,
readier
to
give
than
take
offence
,
and
an
imperious
will
:
yet
as
he
betimes
sees
his
errors
,
and
reforms
in
the
bloom
of
youth
,
an
edifying
lesson
may
be
drawn
from
it
,
for
the
use
of
such
as
are
born
to
large
fortunes
;
and
who
may
be
taught
,
by
his
example
,
the
inexpressible
difference
between
the
hazards
and
remorse
which
attend
a
profligate
course
of
life
,
and
the
pleasures
which
flow
from
virtuous
love
,
and
benevolent
actions
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
character
of
Lady
DAVERS
,
let
the
proud
,
and
the
high
-
born
,
see
the
deformity
of
unreasonable
passion
,
and
how
weak
and
ridiculous
such
persons
must
appear
,
who
suffer
themselves
,
as
is
usually
the
case
,
to
be
hurried
from
the
height
of
violence
,
to
the
most
abject
submission
;
and
subject
themselves
to
be
outdone
by
the
humble
virtue
they
so
much
despise
.
  
<EOS>
Let
good
CLERGYMEN
,
in
Mr.
WILLIAMS
,
see
,
that
whatever
displeasure
the
doing
of
their
duty
may
give
,
for
a
time
,
to
their
proud
patrons
,
Providence
will
,
at
last
,
reward
their
piety
,
and
turn
their
distresses
to
triumph
;
and
make
them
even
more
valued
for
a
conduct
that
gave
offence
while
the
violence
of
passion
lasted
,
than
if
they
had
meanly
stooped
to
flatter
or
soothe
the
vices
of
the
great
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
examples
of
good
old
ANDREWS
and
his
WIFE
,
let
those
,
who
are
reduced
to
a
low
estate
,
see
,
that
Providence
never
fails
to
reward
their
honesty
and
integrity
:
and
that
God
will
,
in
his
own
good
time
,
extricate
them
,
by
means
unforeseen
,
out
of
their
present
difficulties
,
and
reward
them
with
benefits
unhoped
for
.
  
<EOS>
The
UPPER
SERVANTS
of
great
families
may
,
from
the
odious
character
of
Mrs.
JEWKES
,
and
the
amiable
ones
of
Mrs.
JERVIS
,
Mr.
LONGMAN
,
etc
.
<EOS>
learn
what
to
avoid
,
and
what
to
choose
,
to
make
themselves
valued
and
esteemed
by
all
who
know
them
.
  
<EOS>
And
,
from
the
double
conduct
of
poor
JOHN
,
the
LOWER
SERVANTS
may
learn
fidelity
,
and
how
to
distinguish
between
the
lawful
and
unlawful
commands
of
a
superior
.
  
<EOS>
The
poor
deluded
female
,
who
,
like
the
once
unhappy
Miss
GODFREY
,
has
given
up
her
honour
,
and
yielded
to
the
allurements
of
her
designing
lover
,
may
learn
from
her
story
,
to
stop
at
the
first
fault
;
and
,
by
resolving
to
repent
and
amend
,
see
the
pardon
and
blessing
which
await
her
penitence
,
and
a
kind
<EOS>
Providence
ready
to
extend
the
arms
of
its
mercy
to
receive
and
reward
her
returning
duty
:
<EOS>
While
the
prostitute
,
pursuing
the
wicked
courses
,
into
which
,
perhaps
,
she
was
at
first
inadvertently
drawn
,
hurries
herself
into
filthy
diseases
,
and
an
untimely
death
;
and
,
too
probably
,
into
everlasting
perdition
.
  
<EOS>
Let
the
desponding
heart
be
comforted
by
the
happy
issue
which
the
troubles
and
trials
of
PAMELA
met
with
,
when
they
see
,
in
her
case
,
that
no
danger
nor
distress
,
however
inevitable
,
or
deep
to
their
apprehensions
,
can
be
out
of
the
power
of
Providence
to
obviate
or
relieve
;
and
which
,
as
in
various
instances
in
her
story
,
can
turn
the
most
seemingly
grievous
things
to
its
own
glory
,
and
the
reward
of
suffering
innocence
;
and
that
too
,
at
a
time
when
all
human
prospects
seem
to
fail
.
  
<EOS>
Let
the
rich
,
and
those
who
are
exalted
from
a
low
to
a
high
estate
,
learn
from
her
,
that
they
are
not
promoted
only
for
a
single
good
;
but
that
Providence
has
raised
them
,
that
they
should
dispense
to
all
within
their
reach
,
the
blessings
it
has
heaped
upon
them
;
and
that
the
greater
the
power
is
to
which
God
hath
raised
them
,
the
greater
is
the
good
that
will
be
expected
from
them
.
  
<EOS>
From
the
low
opinion
<EOS>
she
every
where
shews
of
herself
,
and
her
attributing
all
her
excellencies
to
pious
education
,
and
her
lady
's
virtuous
instructions
and
bounty
;
let
persons
,
even
of
genius
and
piety
,
learn
not
to
arrogate
to
themselves
those
gifts
and
graces
,
which
they
owe
least
of
all
to
themselves
:
<EOS>
Since
the
beauties
of
person
are
frail
;
and
it
is
not
in
our
power
to
give
them
to
ourselves
,
or
to
be
either
prudent
,
wise
,
or
good
,
without
the
assistance
of
divine
grace
.
  
<EOS>
From
the
same
good
example
,
let
children
see
what
a
blessing
awaits
their
duty
to
their
parents
,
though
ever
so
low
in
the
world
;
and
that
the
only
disgrace
,
is
to
be
dishonest
;
but
none
at
all
to
be
poor
.
  
<EOS>
From
the
economy
she
purposes
to
observe
in
her
elevation
,
let
even
ladies
of
condition
learn
,
that
there
are
family
employments
,
in
which
they
may
and
ought
to
make
themselves
useful
,
and
give
good
examples
to
their
inferiors
,
as
well
as
equals
:
and
that
their
duty
to
God
,
charity
to
the
poor
and
sick
,
and
the
different
branches
of
household
management
,
ought
to
take
up
the
most
considerable
portions
of
their
time
.
  
<EOS>
From
her
signal
veracity
,
which
she
never
forfeited
,
in
all
the
hardships
she
was
tried
with
,
though
her
answers
,
as
she
had
reason
to
apprehend
,
would
often
make
against
her
;
and
the
innocence
she
preserved
throughout
all
her
stratagems
and
contrivances
to
save
herself
from
violation
:
Persons
,
even
sorely
tempted
,
may
learn
to
preserve
a
sacred
regard
to
truth
;
which
always
begets
a
reverence
for
them
,
even
in
the
corruptest
minds
.
      
<EOS>
In
short
,
      
Her
obliging
behaviour
to
her
equals
,
before
her
exaltation
;
her
      
kindness
to
them
afterwards
;
her
forgiving
spirit
,
and
her
      
generosity
;
      
Her
meekness
,
in
every
circumstance
where
her
virtue
was
not
      
concerned
;
      
Her
charitable
allowances
for
others
,
as
in
the
case
of
Miss
      
Godfrey
,
for
faults
she
would
not
have
forgiven
in
herself
;
      
<EOS>
Her
kindness
and
prudence
to
the
offspring
of
that
melancholy
      
adventure
;
      
Her
maiden
and
bridal
purity
,
which
extended
as
well
to
her
      
thoughts
as
to
her
words
and
actions
;
      
Her
signal
affiance
in
God
;
      
Her
thankful
spirit
;
      
Her
grateful
heart
;
      
Her
diffusive
charity
to
the
poor
,
which
made
her
blessed
      
by
them
whenever
she
appeared
abroad
;
      
The
cheerful
ease
and
freedom
of
her
deportment
;
      
Her
parental
,
conjugal
,
and
maternal
duty
;
      
Her
social
virtues
;
  
Are
all
so
many
signal
instances
of
the
excellency
of
her
mind
,
which
may
make
her
character
worthy
of
the
imitation
of
her
sex
.
 
<EOS>
And
the
Editor
of
these
sheets
will
have
his
end
,
if
it
inspires
a
laudable
emulation
in
the
minds
of
any
worthy
persons
,
who
may
thereby
entitle
themselves
to
the
rewards
,
the
praises
,
and
the
blessings
,
by
which
PAMELA
was
so
deservedly
distinguished
.

AUTHOR
'S
ORIGINAL
PREFACE
TO
VOLUME
II
  
<EOS>
The
First
part
of
PAMELA
met
with
a
success
greatly
exceeding
the
most
sanguine
expectations
:
and
the
Editor
hopes
,
that
the
Letters
which
compose
this
Part
will
be
found
equally
written
to
NATURE
,
avoiding
all
romantic
nights
,
improbable
surprises
,
and
irrational
machinery
;
and
the
passions
are
touched
,
where
requisite
;
and
rules
,
equally
new
and
practicable
,
inculcated
throughout
the
whole
,
for
the
general
conduct
of
life
;
and
,
therefore
,
he
flatters
himself
,
that
they
may
expect
the
good
fortune
,
which
few
continuations
have
met
with
,
to
be
judged
not
unworthy
the
First
Part
;
nor
disproportioned
to
the
more
exalted
condition
in
which
PAMELA
was
destined
to
shine
as
an
affectionate
wife
,
a
faithful
friend
,
a
polite
and
kind
neighbour
,
an
indulgent
mother
,
and
a
beneficent
mistress
;
after
having
in
the
former
Part
supported
the
character
of
a
dutiful
child
,
a
spotless
virgin
,
and
a
modest
and
amiable
bride
.
  
<EOS>
The
reader
will
easily
see
,
that
in
so
great
a
choice
of
materials
,
as
must
arise
from
a
multitude
of
important
subjects
,
in
a
married
life
,
to
such
geniuses
and
friendships
as
those
of
Mr.
and
Mrs.
B.
<EOS>
the
Editor
's
greatest
difficulty
was
how
to
bring
them
within
the
compass
which
he
was
determined
not
to
exceed
.
<EOS>
And
it
having
been
left
to
his
own
choice
,
in
what
manner
to
digest
and
publish
the
letters
,
and
where
to
close
the
work
<EOS>
,
he
had
intended
,
at
first
,
in
regard
to
his
other
avocations
,
to
have
carried
the
piece
no
farther
than
the
First
Part
.
  
<EOS>
It
may
be
expected
,
therefore
,
that
he
should
enter
into
an
explanation
of
the
reasons
whereby
he
was
provoked
into
a
necessity
of
altering
his
intention
.
<EOS>
But
he
is
willing
to
decline
saying
any
thing
upon
so
well
-
known
a
subject
.
  
<EOS>
The
Editor
has
been
much
pressed
with
importunities
and
conjectures
,
in
relation
to
the
person
and
family
of
the
gentleman
,
who
are
the
principal
persons
in
the
work
;
all
he
thinks
himself
at
liberty
to
say
,
or
is
necessary
to
be
said
,
is
only
to
repeat
what
has
already
been
hinted
,
that
the
story
has
its
foundation
in
truth
;
and
that
there
was
a
necessity
,
for
obvious
reasons
,
to
vary
and
disguise
some
facts
and
circumstances
,
as
also
the
names
of
persons
,
places
,
&
c.
    
<EOS>
My
dear
father
and
mother
,
  
<EOS>
We
arrived
here
last
night
,
highly
pleased
with
our
journey
,
and
the
occasion
of
it
.
<EOS>
May
God
bless
you
both
with
long
life
and
health
,
to
enjoy
your
sweet
farm
,
and
pretty
dwelling
,
which
is
just
what
I
wished
it
to
be
.
<EOS>
And
do
n't
make
your
grateful
hearts
too
uneasy
in
the
possession
of
it
,
by
your
modest
diffidence
of
your
own
unworthiness
:
for
,
at
the
same
time
,
that
it
is
what
will
do
honour
to
the
best
of
men
<EOS>
,
it
is
not
so
very
extraordinary
,
considering
his
condition
,
as
to
cause
any
one
to
censure
it
as
the
effect
of
a
too
partial
and
injudicious
kindness
for
the
parents
of
one
whom
he
delighteth
to
honour
.
  
<EOS>
My
dear
master
(
why
should
I
not
still
call
him
so
,
bound
to
reverence
him
as
I
am
,
in
every
light
he
can
shine
in
to
the
most
obliging
and
sensible
heart
?
)
<EOS>
still
proposes
to
fit
up
the
large
parlour
,
and
three
apartments
in
the
commodious
dwelling
<EOS>
he
calls
yours
,
for
his
entertainment
and
mine
,
when
I
pay
my
duty
to
you
both
,
for
a
few
happy
days
;
and
he
has
actually
given
orders
to
that
effect
;
and
that
the
three
apartments
be
so
fitted
up
,
as
to
be
rather
suitable
to
your
condition
,
than
his
own
;
for
,
he
says
,
the
plain
simple
elegance
,
which
he
will
have
observed
in
the
rooms
,
as
well
as
the
furniture
,
will
be
a
variety
in
his
retirement
to
this
place
,
that
will
make
him
return
to
his
own
with
the
greater
pleasure
;
and
,
at
the
same
time
,
when
we
are
not
there
,
will
be
of
use
for
the
reception
of
any
of
your
friends
;
and
so
he
shall
not
,
as
he
kindly
says
,
rob
the
good
couple
of
any
of
their
accommodations
.
  
<EOS>
The
old
bow
-
windows
he
will
have
preserved
,
but
will
not
have
them
sashed
,
nor
the
woodbines
,
jessamines
,
and
vines
<EOS>
,
that
run
up
against
them
,
destroyed
:
only
he
will
have
larger
panes
of
glass
,
and
more
convenient
casements
to
let
in
the
sweet
air
and
light
,
and
make
amends
for
that
obstructed
by
the
shades
of
those
fragrant
climbers
.
<EOS>
For
he
has
mentioned
,
three
or
four
times
,
how
gratefully
they
dispensed
their
intermingled
odours
to
us
,
when
,
the
last
evening
we
stood
at
the
window
,
to
hear
the
responsive
songs
of
two
warbling
nightingales
,
one
at
a
distance
,
the
other
near
,
which
delighted
us
for
above
two
hours
,
and
the
more
,
as
we
thought
their
season
had
been
over
.
<EOS>
And
when
they
had
done
,
he
made
me
sing
him
one
,
for
which
he
rewarded
me
with
a
kiss
,
saying
,
"
How
greatly
do
the
innocent
pleasures
I
now
hourly
taste
,
exceed
the
guilty
tumults
that
used
formerly
to
agitate
my
unequal
mind
!
 
<EOS>
Never
talk
,
my
Pamela
,
as
you
frequently
do
,
of
obligation
to
me
:
<EOS>
one
such
hour
as
I
now
enjoy
is
an
ample
reward
for
all
the
benefits
I
can
confer
on
you
and
yours
in
my
whole
life
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
parlour
will
indeed
be
more
elegant
;
though
that
is
to
be
rather
plain
than
rich
,
as
well
in
its
wainscot
as
furniture
,
and
to
be
new
-
floored
.
<EOS>
The
dear
gentleman
has
already
given
orders
,
and
you
will
soon
have
workmen
to
put
them
in
execution
.
<EOS>
The
parlour
-
doors
are
to
have
brass
-
hinges
and
locks
,
and
to
shut
as
close
,
he
tells
them
,
as
a
watch
-
case
:
"
For
who
knows
,
"
said
he
,
"
my
dear
,
but
we
shall
have
still
added
blessings
,
in
two
or
three
charming
boys
and
girls
,
to
place
there
in
their
infancy
,
before
they
can
be
of
age
to
be
benefited
by
your
lessons
and
example
?
<EOS>
And
besides
,
I
shall
no
doubt
entertain
there
<EOS>
some
of
my
chosen
friends
,
in
their
excursions
for
a
day
or
two
.
"
  
<EOS>
How
am
I
,
every
hour
of
my
life
,
overwhelmed
with
instances
of
God
Almighty
's
goodness
and
his
!
<EOS>
O
spare
,
blessed
Father
of
Mercies
,
the
precious
life
of
this
excellent
man
<EOS>
;
increase
my
thankfulness
,
and
my
worthiness
;
 
and
then
 
<EOS>
But
what
shall
I
say
?
 
<EOS>
Only
that
I
may
continue
to
be
what
I
am
;
for
more
blessed
and
happy
,
in
my
own
mind
,
I
can
not
be
.
  
<EOS>
The
beds
he
will
have
of
cloth
,
as
he
thinks
the
situation
a
little
cold
,
especially
when
the
wind
is
easterly
,
and
purposes
to
be
down
in
the
early
spring
season
,
now
and
then
,
as
well
as
in
the
latter
autumn
;
and
the
window
curtains
of
the
same
,
in
one
room
red
,
in
the
other
green
;
but
<EOS>
plain
,
lest
you
should
be
afraid
to
use
them
occasionally
.
<EOS>
The
carpets
for
them
will
be
sent
with
the
other
furniture
;
for
he
will
not
alter
the
old
oaken
floors
of
the
bed
-
chamber
,
nor
the
little
room
he
intends
for
my
use
,
when
I
choose
not
to
join
in
such
company
as
may
happen
to
fall
in
:
"
Which
,
my
dear
,
"
says
he
,
"
shall
be
as
little
as
is
possible
,
only
particular
friends
,
who
may
be
disposed
,
once
in
a
year
or
two
,
to
see
when
I
am
there
,
how
I
live
with
my
Pamela
and
her
parents
,
and
how
I
pass
my
time
in
my
retirement
,
as
I
shall
call
this
:
or
,
perhaps
,
they
will
be
apt
to
think
me
ashamed
of
company
I
shall
always
be
pleased
with
.
<EOS>
Nor
are
you
,
my
dear
,
to
take
this
as
a
compliment
to
yourself
,
but
a
piece
of
requisite
policy
in
me
:
for
who
will
offer
to
reproach
me
with
marrying
,
as
the
world
thinks
,
below
me
,
when
they
shall
see
that
I
not
only
pride
myself
in
my
Pamela
,
but
take
pleasure
in
owning
her
relations
as
mine
,
and
visiting
them
,
and
receiving
visits
from
them
:
and
yet
offer
not
to
set
them
up
in
such
a
glaring
light
,
as
if
I
would
have
the
world
forget
(
who
in
that
case
would
always
take
the
more
pleasure
in
remembering
)
what
they
were
!
<EOS>
And
how
will
it
anticipate
low
reflection
,
when
they
shall
see
,
I
can
bend
my
mind
to
partake
with
them
the
pleasure
of
their
humble
but
decent
life
?
 
<EOS>
Ay
,
"
continued
he
,
"
and
be
rewarded
for
it
too
,
with
better
health
,
better
spirits
,
and
a
better
mind
;
so
that
,
my
dear
,
"
added
he
,
"
I
shall
reap
more
benefit
by
what
I
propose
to
do
,
than
I
shall
confer
.
"
  
<EOS>
In
this
generous
manner
does
this
best
of
men
endeavour
to
disclaim
(
though
I
must
be
very
ungrateful
,
if
,
with
me
,
it
did
not
enhance
)
<EOS>
the
proper
merit
of
a
beneficence
natural
to
him
;
and
which
,
indeed
,
as
I
tell
him
,
may
be
in
one
respect
deprecated
,
inasmuch
as
(
so
excellent
is
his
nature
)
<EOS>
he
can
not
help
it
if
he
would
.
<EOS>
O
that
it
was
in
my
power
to
recompense
him
for
it
!
<EOS>
But
I
am
poor
,
as
I
have
often
said
,
in
every
thing
but
will
 
and
that
is
wholly
his
:
and
what
a
happiness
is
it
to
me
,
a
happiness
I
could
not
so
early
have
hoped
for
,
that
I
can
say
so
without
reserve
;
since
the
dear
object
of
it
requires
nothing
of
me
but
what
is
consistent
with
my
duty
to
the
Supreme
Benefactor
,
the
first
mover
and
cause
of
all
his
own
happiness
,
of
my
happiness
,
and
that
of
my
dear
,
my
ever
dear
parents
.
  
<EOS>
Your
dutiful
and
happy
daughter
.
    
<EOS>
MY
DEAREST
DAUGHTER
,
  
<EOS>
I
need
not
repeat
to
you
<EOS>
the
sense
<EOS>
your
good
mother
<EOS>
and
I
have
of
our
happiness
,
and
of
our
obligations
to
your
honoured
spouse
;
you
both
were
pleased
witnesses
of
it
every
hour
of
the
happy
fortnight
you
passed
with
us
.
<EOS>
Yet
,
my
dear
,
we
hardly
know
how
to
address
ourselves
even
to
you
,
much
less
to
the
'
squire
,
with
the
freedom
he
so
often
invited
us
to
take
:
for
I
do
n't
know
how
it
is
,
but
though
you
are
our
daughter
,
and
so
far
from
being
lifted
up
by
your
high
condition
,
that
we
see
no
difference
in
your
behaviour
to
us
,
your
poor
parents
,
yet
,
viewing
you
as
the
lady
of
so
fine
a
gentleman
,
we
can
not
forbear
having
a
kind
of
respect
,
and
 
I
do
n't
know
what
to
call
it
 
that
lays
a
little
restraint
upon
us
.
<EOS>
And
yet
,
we
should
not
,
methinks
,
let
our
minds
be
run
away
with
the
admiration
of
worldly
grandeur
,
so
as
to
set
too
much
by
it
.
<EOS>
But
your
merit
and
prudence
are
so
much
above
all
we
could
ever
have
any
notion
of
:
and
to
have
gentry
come
only
to
behold
and
admire
you
,
not
so
much
for
your
gentleness
,
and
amiableness
,
or
for
your
behaviour
,
and
affability
to
poor
as
well
as
rich
,
and
to
hear
every
one
calling
you
an
angel
,
and
saying
,
you
deserve
to
be
what
you
are
,
make
us
hardly
know
how
to
look
upon
you
,
but
as
an
angel
indeed
!
<EOS>
I
am
sure
you
have
been
a
good
angel
to
us
;
since
,
for
your
sake
,
God
Almighty
has
put
it
into
your
honoured
husband
's
heart
to
make
us
the
happiest
couple
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
But
little
less
we
should
have
been
,
had
we
only
in
some
far
distant
land
heard
of
our
dear
child
's
happiness
and
never
partaken
of
the
benefits
of
it
ourselves
.
<EOS>
But
thus
to
be
provided
for
!
<EOS>
thus
kindly
to
be
owned
,
and
called
Father
and
Mother
by
such
a
brave
gentleman
!
<EOS>
and
so
placed
as
to
have
nothing
to
do
but
to
bless
God
,
him
,
and
you
,
and
hourly
pray
for
you
both
<EOS>
,
is
a
providence
too
mighty
to
be
borne
by
us
,
with
equalness
of
temper
:
we
kneel
together
every
morning
,
noon
,
and
night
,
and
weep
and
rejoice
,
and
rejoice
and
weep
,
to
think
how
our
unworthiness
is
distinguished
,
and
how
God
has
provided
for
us
in
our
latter
days
;
when
all
our
fear
was
,
that
,
as
we
grew
older
and
more
infirm
,
and
worn
out
by
hard
labour
,
we
should
be
troublesome
<EOS>
where
,
not
our
pride
,
but
our
industrious
wills
,
would
have
made
us
wish
not
to
be
so
;
 
but
to
be
entitled
to
a
happier
lot
:
for
this
would
have
grieved
us
the
more
,
for
the
sake
of
you
,
my
dear
child
,
and
your
unhappy
brother
's
children
:
for
it
is
well
known
,
that
,
though
we
pretend
not
to
boast
of
our
family
,
and
indeed
have
no
reason
,
yet
none
of
us
were
ever
sunk
so
low
as
I
was
:
to
be
sure
,
partly
by
my
own
fault
;
for
,
had
it
been
for
your
poor
aged
mother
's
sake
only
,
I
ought
not
to
have
done
what
I
did
for
John
and
William
;
for
so
unhappy
were
they
,
poor
lads
!
<EOS>
that
what
I
could
do
,
was
but
as
a
drop
of
water
to
a
bucket
.
  
<EOS>
You
command
me
 
<EOS>
Let
me
,
as
writing
to
Mr.
B.
's
lady
,
say
command
,
though
,
as
to
my
dear
daughter
,
I
will
only
say
desire
:
<EOS>
and
,
indeed
,
I
will
not
,
as
you
wish
me
not
to
do
<EOS>
,
let
the
one
condition
,
which
was
accidental
,
put
the
other
,
which
was
natural
,
out
of
my
thought
:
you
spoke
it
in
better
words
,
but
this
was
the
sense
.
<EOS>
But
you
have
the
gift
of
utterance
;
and
education
is
a
fine
thing
,
where
it
meets
with
such
talents
to
improve
upon
,
as
God
has
given
you
.
<EOS>
Yet
let
me
not
forget
what
I
was
going
to
say
 
You
command
 
<EOS>
or
,
if
you
please
 
you
desire
me
to
write
long
letters
,
and
<EOS>
often
 
And
how
can
I
help
it
,
if
I
would
?
<EOS>
For
when
here
,
in
this
happy
dwelling
,
and
this
well
-
stocked
farm
,
in
these
rich
meadows
,
and
well
-
cropt
acres
,
we
look
around
us
,
and
which
way
soever
we
turn
our
head
,
see
blessings
upon
blessings
,
and
plenty
upon
plenty
,
see
barns
well
stored
,
poultry
increasing
,
the
kine
lowing
and
crowding
about
us
:
and
are
bid
to
call
them
our
own
.
<EOS>
Then
think
,
that
all
is
the
reward
of
our
child
's
virtue
!
 
<EOS>
O
my
dear
daughter
,
who
can
bear
these
things
!
 
<EOS>
Excuse
me
!
<EOS>
I
must
break
off
a
little
!
<EOS>
For
my
eyes
are
as
full
as
my
heart
:
and
I
will
retire
to
bless
God
,
and
your
honoured
husband
.
  
<EOS>
So
,
my
dear
child
,
I
now
again
take
up
my
pen
:
but
reading
what
I
had
written
,
in
order
to
carry
on
the
thread
,
I
can
hardly
forbear
again
being
in
one
sort
affected
.
<EOS>
But
do
you
think
I
will
call
all
these
things
my
own
?
 
<EOS>
Do
you
think
I
would
live
rent
-
free
?
<EOS>
Can
the
honoured
"
squire
believe
,
that
having
such
a
generous
example
before
me
,
if
I
had
no
gratitude
in
my
temper
before
,
I
could
help
being
touched
by
such
an
one
as
he
sets
me
?
<EOS>
If
this
goodness
makes
him
know
no
mean
in
giving
,
shall
I
be
so
greedy
as
to
know
none
in
receiving
?
<EOS>
Come
,
come
,
my
dear
child
,
your
poor
father
is
not
so
sordid
a
wretch
,
neither
.
<EOS>
He
will
shew
the
world
that
all
these
benefits
are
not
thrown
away
upon
one
,
who
will
disgrace
you
as
much
by
his
temper
,
as
by
his
condition
.
<EOS>
What
though
I
can
not
be
as
worthy
of
all
these
favours
as
I
wish
,
I
will
be
as
worthy
as
I
can
.
<EOS>
And
let
me
tell
you
,
my
dear
child
,
if
the
king
and
his
royal
family
(
God
bless
'
em
!
)
<EOS>
be
not
ashamed
to
receive
taxes
and
duties
from
his
subjects
;
if
dukes
and
earls
,
and
all
the
top
gentry
,
can
not
support
their
bravery
,
without
having
their
rents
paid
;
I
hope
I
shall
not
affront
the
"
squire
,
to
pay
to
his
steward
,
what
any
other
person
would
pay
for
his
noble
stock
,
and
improving
farm
:
and
I
will
do
it
,
if
it
please
God
to
bless
me
with
life
and
health
.
<EOS>
I
should
not
be
worthy
to
crawl
upon
the
earth
,
if
I
did
not
.
<EOS>
And
what
did
I
say
to
Mr.
Longman
,
the
faithful
Mr.
Longman
!
<EOS>
Sure
no
gentleman
had
ever
a
more
worthy
steward
than
he
<EOS>
:
it
was
as
we
were
walking
over
the
grounds
together
,
and
observing
in
<EOS>
what
good
order
every
thing
was
,
he
was
praising
some
little
contrivances
of
my
own
,
for
the
improvement
of
the
farm
,
and
saying
,
how
comfortably
he
hoped
we
might
live
upon
it
.
"
<EOS>
Ay
,
Mr.
Longman
,
"
said
I
,
"
comfortably
indeed
:
<EOS>
but
do
you
think
I
could
be
properly
said
to
live
,
if
I
was
not
to
pay
as
much
rent
for
it
as
another
?
"
    
"
I
can
tell
you
,
"
said
he
,
"
the
"
squire
will
not
receive
any
thing
from
you
,
Goodman
Andrews
.
<EOS>
Why
,
man
,
he
has
no
occasion
for
it
:
he
's
worth
a
power
of
money
,
besides
a
noble
and
clear
estate
in
land
.
<EOS>
Ad's
-
heartlikens
,
you
must
not
affront
him
,
I
can
tell
you
that
:
he
's
as
generous
as
a
prince
,
where
he
takes
;
but
he
is
hasty
,
and
will
have
his
own
way
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
for
that
reason
,
Mr.
Longman
,
"
said
I
,
"
I
was
thinking
to
make
you
my
friend
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Make
me
your
friend
!
<EOS>
You
have
not
a
better
in
the
world
,
to
my
power
,
I
can
tell
you
that
,
nor
your
dame
neither
;
for
I
love
such
honest
hearts
<EOS>
:
I
wish
my
own
brother
would
let
me
love
him
as
well
;
but
let
that
pass
.
<EOS>
What
I
can
do
for
you
,
I
will
,
and
here
's
my
hand
upon
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
then
,
"
said
I
,
<EOS>
"
it
is
this
:
let
me
account
to
you
at
the
rent
Farmer
Dickens
offered
,
and
let
me
know
what
the
stock
cost
,
and
what
the
crops
are
valued
at
;
and
pay
the
one
as
I
can
,
and
the
other
quarterly
;
and
not
let
the
"
squire
know
it
till
you
ca
n't
choose
;
and
I
shall
be
as
happy
as
a
prince
;
<EOS>
for
I
doubt
not
,
by
God
's
blessing
,
to
make
a
comfortable
livelihood
of
it
besides
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
dost
believe
,
Goodman
Andrews
,
"
said
he
,
"
that
I
would
do
such
a
thing
?
<EOS>
Would
not
his
honour
think
if
I
hid
one
thing
from
him
,
I
might
hide
another
?
<EOS>
Go
to
,
honest
heart
,
I
love
thee
dearly
;
but
can
Mr.
B.
do
too
much
for
his
lady
,
think'st
thou
?
<EOS>
Come
,
come
"
(
and
he
jeered
me
so
<EOS>
,
I
knew
not
what
to
say
)
,
"
I
wish
at
bottom
there
is
not
some
pride
in
this
.
<EOS>
What
,
I
warrant
,
you
would
not
be
too
much
beholden
to
his
honour
,
would
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
I
,
"
it
is
not
that
,
I
'm
sure
.
<EOS>
If
I
have
any
pride
,
it
is
only
in
my
dear
child
 
to
whom
,
under
God
,
all
this
is
owing
.
<EOS>
But
some
how
or
other
it
shall
be
so
.
"
  
<EOS>
And
so
,
my
dear
daughter
,
I
resolve
it
shall
;
and
it
will
be
,
over
and
above
,
one
of
the
greatest
pleasures
to
me
,
to
do
the
good
"
squire
service
,
as
well
as
to
be
so
much
benefited
and
obliged
by
him
.
  
<EOS>
Our
eldest
grandson
Thomas
desires
to
come
and
live
with
us
<EOS>
:
the
boy
is
honest
,
and
,
I
hear
,
industrious
.
<EOS>
And
cousin
Borroughs
wants
me
to
employ
his
son
Roger
,
who
understands
the
business
of
a
farm
very
well
.
<EOS>
It
is
no
wonder
,
that
all
one
's
relations
should
wish
to
partake
of
our
happy
lot
;
and
if
they
can
and
will
do
their
business
as
well
as
others
<EOS>
,
I
see
not
why
relationship
should
be
an
objection
:
<EOS>
but
,
yet
,
I
think
,
one
should
not
beleaguer
,
as
one
may
say
,
your
honoured
husband
with
one
's
relations
.
<EOS>
You
,
my
best
child
,
will
give
me
always
your
advice
,
as
to
my
carriage
in
this
my
new
lot
;
for
I
would
not
for
the
world
be
thought
an
encroacher
.
<EOS>
And
you
have
so
followed
than
yours
.
  
<EOS>
Our
blessing
(
I
am
sure
you
have
blessed
us
!
)
<EOS>
attend
you
,
my
dearest
child
;
and
may
you
be
as
happy
as
you
have
made
us
<EOS>
(
I
can
not
wish
you
to
be
happier
,
because
I
have
no
notion
how
it
can
be
in
this
life
)
.
<EOS>
Conclude
us
,
your
ever
-
loving
father
and
mother
,
  
JOHN
and
ELIZ
.
<EOS>
ANDREWS
.
  
<EOS>
May
we
hope
to
be
favoured
now
and
then
with
a
letter
from
you
,
my
dear
child
,
like
some
of
your
former
,
to
let
us
know
how
you
go
on
?
<EOS>
It
would
be
a
great
joy
to
us
;
indeed
it
would
.
<EOS>
But
we
know
you
'll
have
enough
to
do
without
obliging
us
in
this
way
.
<EOS>
So
must
acquiesce
.
    
<EOS>
MY
DEAR
FATHER
AND
MOTHER
,
  
I
have
shewed
your
letter
to
my
beloved
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
be
uneasy
that
I
have
;
for
you
need
not
be
ashamed
of
it
,
since
it
is
my
pride
to
have
such
honest
and
grateful
parents
:
and
I
'll
tell
you
what
he
said
to
it
,
as
the
best
argument
I
can
use
,
why
you
should
not
be
uneasy
,
but
enjoy
without
pain
or
anxiety
all
the
benefits
of
your
happy
lot
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
good
souls
!
<EOS>
"
said
he
,
"
now
every
thing
they
say
and
write
manifests
the
worthiness
of
their
hearts
!
<EOS>
No
wonder
,
Pamela
,
you
love
and
revere
such
honest
minds
;
for
that
you
would
do
,
were
they
not
your
parents
:
and
tell
them
,
that
I
am
so
far
from
having
them
believe
what
I
have
done
for
them
were
only
from
my
affection
for
their
daughter
,
<EOS>
that
let
'em
find
out
another
couple
as
worthy
as
they
are
,
and
I
will
do
as
much
for
them
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
place
them
,
"
he
continued
,
"
in
the
same
county
,
because
I
would
wish
two
counties
to
be
blessed
for
their
sakes
.
<EOS>
Tell
them
,
my
dear
,
that
they
have
a
right
to
what
they
enjoy
on
the
foot
of
their
own
proper
merit
;
and
bid
them
enjoy
it
as
their
patrimony
;
and
if
any
thing
arise
that
is
more
than
they
themselves
can
wish
for
,
in
their
way
of
life
,
let
them
look
among
their
own
relations
,
where
it
may
be
acceptable
,
and
communicate
to
them
the
like
solid
reasons
for
rejoicing
in
the
situation
they
are
pleased
with
:
and
do
you
,
my
dear
,
still
farther
enable
them
,
as
you
shall
judge
proper
,
to
gratify
their
enlarged
hearts
,
for
fear
they
should
deny
any
comfort
to
themselves
,
in
order
to
do
good
to
others
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
could
only
fly
to
his
generous
bosom
(
for
this
is
a
subject
which
most
affects
me
)
,
and
,
with
my
eyes
swimming
in
tears
of
grateful
joy
,
and
which
overflowed
as
soon
as
my
bold
lips
touched
his
dear
face
,
bless
God
,
and
bless
him
,
with
my
whole
heart
;
for
speak
I
could
not
!
<EOS>
But
,
almost
chok'd
<EOS>
with
my
joy
,
sobb'd
to
him
my
grateful
acknowledgments
.
<EOS>
He
clasped
me
in
his
arms
,
and
said
,
"
How
,
my
dearest
,
do
you
overpay
me
for
the
little
I
have
done
for
your
parents
!
<EOS>
If
it
be
thus
to
be
bless'd
for
conferring
benefits
so
insignificant
to
a
man
of
my
fortune
,
what
joys
is
it
not
in
the
power
of
rich
men
to
give
themselves
,
whenever
they
please
!
 
<EOS>
Foretastes
,
indeed
,
of
those
we
are
bid
to
hope
for
:
which
can
surely
only
exceed
these
,
as
then
we
shall
be
all
intellect
,
and
better
fitted
to
receive
them
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
'
Tis
too
much
!
 
<EOS>
too
much
,
"
said
I
,
in
broken
accents
<EOS>
:
"
how
am
I
oppressed
with
the
pleasure
you
give
me
!
 
<EOS>
O
,
Sir
,
bless
me
more
gradually
,
and
more
cautiously
 
for
I
can
not
bear
it
!
"
<EOS>
And
,
indeed
,
my
heart
went
flutter
,
flutter
,
flutter
,
at
his
dear
breast
,
as
if
it
wanted
to
break
its
too
narrow
prison
,
to
mingle
still
more
intimately
with
his
own
.
  
<EOS>
Surely
,
my
beloved
parents
,
nobody
's
happiness
is
so
great
as
mine
!
 
<EOS>
If
it
proceeds
thus
from
degree
to
degree
,
and
is
to
be
augmented
by
the
charming
hope
,
that
the
dear
second
author
of
our
blessings
,
be
the
uniformly
good
as
well
as
the
partially
kind
man
to
us
,
what
a
felicity
will
this
be
!
<EOS>
and
if
our
prayers
shall
be
heard
,
and
we
shall
have
the
pleasure
to
think
,
that
his
advances
in
piety
are
owing
not
a
little
to
them
,
and
to
the
example
God
shall
give
us
grace
to
set
;
then
,
indeed
,
may
we
take
the
pride
to
think
,
we
have
repaid
his
goodness
to
us
,
and
that
we
have
satisfied
the
debt
,
which
nothing
less
can
discharge
.
  
<EOS>
Forgive
me
,
my
worthy
parents
,
if
my
style
on
this
subject
be
raised
above
the
natural
simplicity
,
more
suited
to
my
humble
talents
.
<EOS>
But
how
can
I
help
it
!
<EOS>
For
when
the
mind
is
elevated
,
ought
not
the
sense
we
have
of
our
happiness
to
make
our
expressions
soar
equally
?
<EOS>
Can
the
affections
be
so
highly
raised
as
mine
are
on
these
occasions
,
and
the
thoughts
creep
grovelling
like
one
's
ordinary
self
?
<EOS>
No
,
indeed
!
 
<EOS>
Call
not
this
,
therefore
,
the
gift
of
utterance
,
if
it
should
appear
to
you
in
a
better
light
than
it
deserves
.
<EOS>
It
is
the
gift
of
gratitude
;
a
gift
which
makes
you
and
me
to
speak
and
write
,
as
I
hope
it
will
make
us
act
,
above
ourselves
.
<EOS>
Thus
will
our
gratitude
be
the
inspirer
of
joy
to
our
common
benefactor
;
and
his
joy
will
heighten
our
gratitude
;
and
so
we
shall
proceed
,
as
cause
and
effect
to
each
other
's
happiness
,
to
bless
the
dear
man
who
blesses
us
.
<EOS>
And
will
it
be
right
then
to
say
,
you
are
uneasy
under
such
(
at
least
as
to
your
wills
)
returned
and
discharged
obligations
?
<EOS>
God
Almighty
requires
only
a
thankful
heart
for
all
the
mercies
he
heaps
upon
the
children
of
men
;
my
dear
Mr.
B.
,
who
in
these
particulars
imitates
Divinity
,
desires
no
more
.
<EOS>
You
have
this
thankful
heart
;
and
that
to
such
a
high
degree
of
gratitude
,
that
nobody
can
exceed
you
.
  
<EOS>
But
yet
,
when
your
worthy
minds
would
be
too
much
affected
with
your
gratitude
,
so
as
to
lay
under
the
restraints
you
mention
,
to
the
dear
gentleman
,
and
for
his
sake
,
to
your
dependent
daughter
;
let
me
humbly
advise
you
,
with
more
particular
,
more
abstracted
aspirations
,
than
at
other
times
,
to
raise
your
thoughts
upwards
,
and
consider
who
it
is
that
gives
him
the
opportunity
;
and
pray
for
him
and
for
me
;
for
him
,
that
all
his
future
actions
may
be
of
a
piece
with
this
noble
disposition
of
mind
;
for
me
,
that
I
may
continue
humble
,
and
consider
myself
blest
for
your
sakes
,
and
in
order
that
I
may
be
,
in
some
sort
,
a
rewarder
,
in
the
hands
of
Providence
,
of
this
its
dear
excellent
agent
;
and
then
we
shall
look
forward
,
all
of
us
,
with
pleasure
,
indeed
,
to
that
state
,
where
there
is
no
distinction
of
degree
,
and
where
the
humble
cottager
shall
be
upon
a
par
with
the
proudest
monarch
.
  
<EOS>
O
<EOS>
my
dear
parents
,
how
can
you
,
as
in
your
postscript
,
say
,
"
May
we
not
be
favoured
now
-
and
-
then
with
a
letter
?
<EOS>
"
Call
me
your
daughter
,
your
Pamela
 
<EOS>
I
am
no
lady
to
you
.
<EOS>
I
have
more
pleasure
to
be
called
your
comfort
,
and
thought
to
act
worthy
of
the
sentiments
with
which
your
example
and
instructions
have
inspired
me
,
than
in
any
other
thing
in
this
life
;
my
determined
duty
to
our
common
benefactor
,
the
best
of
gentlemen
and
husbands
,
excepted
.
<EOS>
God
has
blessed
me
for
your
sakes
,
and
has
thus
answered
for
me
all
your
prayers
;
nay
,
more
than
answered
all
you
or
I
could
have
wished
or
hoped
for
.
<EOS>
We
only
prayed
,
only
hoped
,
that
God
would
preserve
you
honest
,
and
me
virtuous
:
and
,
O
see
,
<EOS>
my
excellent
parents
,
how
we
are
crowned
with
blessings
upon
blessings
,
till
we
are
the
talk
of
all
that
know
us
.
  
<EOS>
Hence
,
my
dear
parents
(
I
mean
,
from
the
delight
I
have
in
writing
to
you
,
which
transports
me
far
above
my
own
sphere
)
,
you
'll
see
,
that
I
must
write
,
and
can
not
help
it
,
if
I
would
.
<EOS>
And
will
it
be
a
great
joy
to
you
?
 
<EOS>
And
is
there
any
thing
that
can
add
to
your
joy
,
think
you
,
in
the
power
of
your
Pamela
,
that
she
would
not
do
?
<EOS>
O
that
the
lives
and
healths
of
my
dearest
Mr.
B.
and
you
,
my
parents
,
may
be
continued
to
me
!
<EOS>
And
who
can
then
be
so
blest
as
your
Pamela
?
  
<EOS>
I
will
write
,
depend
upon
it
,
on
every
occasion
 
<EOS>
and
you
augment
my
joys
to
think
it
is
in
my
power
to
add
to
your
comforts
.
<EOS>
Nor
can
you
conceive
my
pleasure
in
hoping
that
this
your
new
happy
lot
may
,
by
relieving
you
from
corroding
care
,
and
the
too
wearying
effects
of
hard
labour
,
add
,
in
these
your
advanced
years
,
to
both
your
days
.
<EOS>
For
,
so
happy
am
I
,
<EOS>
I
can
have
no
grief
,
no
pain
,
in
looking
forward
,
but
from
reflecting
,
that
one
day
we
must
be
separated
.
  
<EOS>
But
it
is
fit
that
we
so
comport
ourselves
as
not
to
embitter
our
present
happiness
with
prospects
too
gloomy
 
but
bring
our
minds
to
be
cheerfully
thankful
for
the
present
,
wisely
to
enjoy
that
present
as
we
go
along
 
and
at
last
,
when
all
is
to
be
wound
up
 
lie
down
,
and
say
,
"
Not
mine
,
but
Thy
will
be
done
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
have
written
much
;
yet
have
still
more
to
say
relating
to
other
parts
of
your
kind
acceptable
letter
;
and
so
will
soon
write
again
:
<EOS>
for
I
must
think
every
opportunity
happy
,
<EOS>
whereby
I
can
assure
you
,
how
much
I
am
,
and
will
ever
be
,
without
any
addition
to
my
name
,
if
it
will
make
you
easier
,
your
dutiful
  
PAMELA
.
    
<EOS>
MY
DEAREST
FATHER
AND
MOTHER
,
  
I
now
write
again
,
as
I
told
you
I
should
in
my
last
;
but
I
am
half
afraid
to
look
at
the
copy
of
it
;
for
your
worthy
hearts
,
so
visible
in
your
letter
and
<EOS>
my
beloved
's
kind
deportment
upon
shewing
it
to
him
,
raised
me
into
a
frame
of
mind
,
bordering
on
ecstasy
:
yet
I
wrote
my
heart
.
<EOS>
But
you
must
not
,
my
dear
father
,
write
to
your
Pamela
so
affectingly
.
<EOS>
Your
steadier
mind
could
hardly
bear
your
own
moving
strain
,
and
you
were
forced
to
lay
down
your
pen
,
and
retire
:
how
then
could
I
,
who
love
you
so
dearly
,
if
you
had
not
increased
that
love
by
fresh
and
stronger
instances
of
your
worthiness
,
forbear
being
affected
,
and
raised
above
myself
!
<EOS>
But
I
will
not
again
touch
upon
this
subject
.
  
<EOS>
You
must
know
then
,
that
my
dearest
spouse
commands
me
,
with
his
kind
respects
,
to
tell
you
,
he
has
thought
of
a
method
to
make
your
worthy
hearts
easy
;
those
were
his
words
:
"
And
this
is
,
"
said
he
,
"
by
putting
that
whole
estate
,
with
the
new
purchase
,
under
your
father
's
care
,
as
I
at
first
intended
:
he
shall
receive
and
pay
,
and
order
every
thing
as
he
pleases
:
and
Longman
,
who
grows
in
years
,
shall
be
eased
of
that
burden
.
<EOS>
Your
father
writes
a
very
legible
hand
,
and
shall
take
what
assistants
he
pleases
;
and
do
you
,
Pamela
,
see
that
this
new
task
be
made
as
easy
and
pleasant
to
him
as
possible
.
<EOS>
He
shall
make
up
his
accounts
only
to
you
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
And
there
will
be
several
pleasures
arise
to
me
upon
it
:
<EOS>
first
,
that
it
will
be
a
relief
to
honest
Longman
,
who
has
business
enough
on
his
hands
.
<EOS>
Next
,
it
will
make
the
good
couple
easy
,
to
have
an
opportunity
of
enjoying
that
as
their
due
,
which
now
their
too
grateful
hearts
give
them
so
many
causeless
scruples
about
.
<EOS>
Thirdly
,
it
will
employ
your
father
's
time
,
more
suitably
to
your
liking
and
mine
,
because
with
more
ease
to
himself
;
for
you
see
his
industrious
will
can
not
be
satisfied
without
doing
something
.
<EOS>
In
the
fourth
place
,
the
management
of
this
estate
will
gain
him
more
respect
and
reverence
among
the
tenants
and
his
neighbours
:
and
yet
be
all
in
his
own
way
.
<EOS>
For
,
"
added
he
,
"
you
'll
see
,
that
it
is
always
one
point
in
view
with
me
,
to
endeavour
to
convince
every
one
,
that
I
esteem
and
value
them
for
their
own
intrinsic
merit
,
and
want
not
any
body
to
distinguish
them
in
any
other
light
than
that
in
which
they
have
been
accustomed
to
appear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
So
,
my
dear
father
,
the
instrument
will
be
drawn
,
and
brought
you
by
honest
Mr.
Longman
,
who
will
be
with
you
in
a
few
days
to
put
the
last
hand
to
the
new
purchase
,
and
to
give
you
possession
of
your
new
commission
,
if
you
accept
it
,
as
I
hope
you
will
;
and
the
rather
,
for
my
dear
Mr.
B.
's
third
reason
;
and
knowing
that
this
trust
will
be
discharged
as
worthily
and
as
sufficiently
,
after
you
are
used
to
it
,
as
if
Mr.
Longman
himself
was
in
it
 
and
better
it
can
not
be
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Longman
is
very
fond
of
this
relief
,
and
longs
to
be
down
to
settle
every
thing
with
you
,
as
to
the
proper
powers
,
the
method
,
&
c.
<EOS>
And
he
says
,
in
his
usual
phrase
,
that
he
'll
make
it
as
easy
to
you
as
a
glove
.
  
<EOS>
If
you
do
accept
it
,
my
dear
Mr.
B.
will
leave
every
thing
to
you
,
as
to
rent
,
where
not
already
fixed
,
and
,
likewise
,
as
to
acts
of
kindness
and
favour
to
be
done
where
you
think
proper
;
and
he
says
,
that
,
with
his
bad
qualities
,
he
was
ever
deemed
a
kind
landlord
;
and
that
I
can
confirm
in
fifty
instances
to
his
honour
:
"
<EOS>
So
that
the
old
gentleman
,
"
said
he
,
"
need
not
be
afraid
of
being
put
upon
severe
or
harsh
methods
of
proceeding
,
where
things
will
do
without
;
and
he
can
always
befriend
an
honest
man
;
by
which
means
the
province
will
be
entirely
such
a
one
as
suits
with
his
inclination
.
<EOS>
If
any
thing
difficult
or
perplexing
arises
<EOS>
,
"
continued
he
,
"
or
where
a
little
knowledge
in
law
-
matters
is
necessary
,
Longman
shall
do
all
that
:
and
your
father
will
see
that
he
will
not
have
in
those
points
a
coadjutor
too
hard
-
hearted
for
his
wish
;
for
it
was
a
rule
my
father
set
me
,
and
I
have
strictly
followed
,
that
although
I
have
a
lawyer
for
my
steward
,
it
was
rather
to
know
how
to
do
right
things
,
than
oppressive
ones
;
and
Longman
has
so
well
answered
this
intention
,
that
he
was
always
more
noted
for
composing
differences
,
than
promoting
lawsuits
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
dare
say
,
my
dear
father
,
this
will
be
acceptable
to
you
,
on
the
several
accounts
my
dearest
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
was
pleased
to
mention
:
and
what
a
charming
contrivance
is
here
!
<EOS>
God
for
ever
bless
his
considerate
heart
for
it
!
<EOS>
To
make
you
useful
to
him
,
and
easy
to
yourself
:
as
well
as
respected
by
,
and
even
a
benefactor
to
all
around
you
!
<EOS>
What
can
one
say
to
all
things
?
<EOS>
But
what
signifies
exulting
on
one
's
gratitude
for
one
benefit
;
 
every
hour
the
dear
man
heaps
new
ones
upon
us
,
and
we
can
hardly
thank
him
for
one
,
but
a
second
,
and
a
third
,
and
so
on
to
countless
degrees
,
confound
one
,
and
throw
back
our
words
upon
our
hearts
before
they
are
well
formed
,
and
oblige
us
to
sit
down
under
all
with
profound
silence
and
admiration
.
  
<EOS>
As
to
the
desire
of
cousin
Thomas
,
and
Roger
,
to
live
with
you
,
I
endeavoured
to
sound
what
our
dear
benefactor
's
opinion
was
.
<EOS>
He
was
pleased
to
say
,
"
I
have
no
choice
in
this
case
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
Your
father
is
his
own
master
:
he
may
employ
whom
he
pleases
;
and
,
if
they
shew
respect
to
him
and
your
mother
,
I
think
,
as
he
rightly
observes
,
relationship
should
rather
have
the
preference
;
and
as
he
can
remedy
inconveniences
,
if
he
finds
any
,
by
all
means
to
let
every
branch
of
your
family
have
reason
to
rejoice
with
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
But
I
have
thought
of
this
matter
a
good
deal
,
since
I
had
the
favour
of
your
letter
;
and
I
hope
,
since
you
condescend
to
ask
my
advice
,
you
will
excuse
me
,
if
I
give
it
freely
;
yet
entirely
submitting
all
to
your
liking
.
  
<EOS>
First
,
then
,
I
think
it
better
to
have
any
body
than
relations
;
and
for
these
reasons
:
  
One
is
apt
to
expect
more
regard
from
them
,
and
they
more
indulgence
than
strangers
can
hope
for
.
  
<EOS>
That
where
there
is
such
a
difference
in
the
expectations
of
both
,
uneasiness
can
not
but
arise
.
  
<EOS>
That
this
will
subject
you
to
bear
it
,
or
to
resent
it
,
and
to
part
with
them
.
<EOS>
If
you
bear
it
,
you
will
know
no
end
of
impositions
:
if
you
dismiss
them
,
it
will
occasion
ill
-
will
.
<EOS>
They
will
call
you
unkind
;
and
you
them
ungrateful
:
and
as
your
prosperous
lot
may
raise
you
enviers
,
such
will
be
apt
to
believe
them
rather
than
you
.
  
<EOS>
Then
the
world
will
be
inclined
to
think
that
we
are
crowding
upon
a
generous
gentleman
a
numerous
family
of
indigent
people
;
and
it
will
be
said
,
"
The
girl
is
filling
every
place
with
her
relations
,
and
beleaguering
,
"
as
you
significantly
express
it
,
"
a
worthy
gentleman
;
"
should
one
's
kindred
behave
ever
so
worthily
.
<EOS>
So
,
in
the
next
place
,
one
would
not
,
for
their
sakes
,
that
this
should
be
done
;
who
may
live
with
less
reproach
,
and
equal
benefit
,
any
where
else
;
for
I
would
not
wish
any
one
of
them
to
be
lifted
out
of
his
station
,
and
made
independent
,
at
Mr.
B.
's
expense
,
if
their
industry
will
not
do
it
;
although
I
would
never
scruple
to
do
any
thing
reasonable
to
promote
or
assist
that
industry
,
in
the
way
of
their
callings
.
  
<EOS>
Then
,
my
dear
father
,
I
apprehend
,
that
our
honoured
benefactor
would
be
under
some
difficulty
,
from
his
natural
politeness
,
and
regard
for
you
and
me
.
<EOS>
You
see
how
kindly
,
on
all
occasions
,
he
treats
you
both
,
not
only
as
the
parents
of
his
Pamela
,
but
as
if
you
were
his
own
;
and
if
you
had
any
body
as
your
servants
there
,
who
called
you
cousin
,
or
grandfather
,
or
uncle
,
he
would
not
care
,
when
he
came
down
,
to
treat
them
on
the
foot
of
common
servants
,
though
they
might
think
themselves
honoured
(
as
they
would
be
,
and
as
I
shall
always
think
myself
)
with
his
commands
.
<EOS>
And
would
it
not
,
if
they
are
modest
and
worthy
,
be
as
great
a
difficulty
upon
them
,
to
be
thus
distinguished
,
as
it
would
be
to
him
and
to
me
,
for
his
sake
?
<EOS>
For
otherwise
(
believe
me
,
I
hope
you
will
,
my
dear
father
and
mother
)
,
I
could
sit
down
and
rejoice
with
the
meanest
and
remotest
relation
I
have
.
<EOS>
But
in
the
world
's
eye
,
to
every
body
but
my
best
of
parents
,
I
must
,
if
ever
so
reluctant
to
it
,
appear
in
a
light
that
may
not
give
discredit
to
his
choice
.
  
<EOS>
Then
again
,
as
I
hinted
,
you
will
be
able
,
without
the
least
injury
to
our
common
benefactor
,
to
do
kinder
things
by
any
of
our
relations
,
when
not
with
you
,
than
you
can
do
,
if
they
live
with
you
.
  
<EOS>
You
may
lend
them
a
little
money
to
put
them
in
a
way
,
if
any
thing
offers
that
you
think
will
be
to
their
advantage
.
<EOS>
You
can
fit
out
my
she
-
cousins
to
good
reputable
places
.
<EOS>
The
younger
you
can
put
to
school
,
or
,
when
fit
,
to
trades
,
according
to
their
talents
;
and
so
they
will
be
of
course
in
a
way
to
get
an
honest
and
creditable
livelihood
.
  
<EOS>
But
,
above
all
things
,
one
would
discourage
such
a
proud
and
ambitious
spirit
in
any
of
them
,
as
should
want
to
raise
itself
by
favour
instead
of
merit
;
and
this
the
rather
,
for
,
undoubtedly
,
there
are
many
more
happy
persons
in
low
than
in
high
life
,
take
number
for
number
all
the
world
over
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
,
although
four
or
five
years
of
different
life
had
passed
with
me
,
I
had
so
much
pride
and
pleasure
in
the
thought
of
working
for
my
living
with
you
,
if
I
could
but
get
honest
to
you
,
that
it
made
my
confinement
the
more
grievous
,
and
,
if
possible
,
aggravated
the
apprehensions
attending
it
.
  
<EOS>
But
I
beg
of
you
,
not
to
think
these
my
reasons
proceed
from
the
bad
motives
of
a
heart
tainted
with
pride
on
its
high
condition
.
<EOS>
Indeed
there
can
be
no
reason
for
it
,
to
one
who
thinks
after
this
manner
 
the
greatest
families
on
earth
have
some
among
them
who
are
unhappy
and
low
in
life
;
and
shall
such
a
one
reproach
me
with
having
twenty
low
relations
,
because
they
have
,
peradventure
,
not
above
five
?
  
<EOS>
Let
us
then
,
my
dear
parents
,
endeavour
to
judge
of
one
another
,
as
God
,
at
the
last
day
,
will
judge
of
us
all
:
and
then
the
honest
peasant
will
stand
fairer
in
our
esteem
than
the
guilty
peer
.
  
<EOS>
In
short
,
this
shall
be
my
own
rule
 
<EOS>
Every
one
who
acts
justly
and
honestly
,
I
will
look
upon
as
my
relation
,
whether
so
or
not
;
and
the
more
he
wants
my
assistance
,
<EOS>
the
more
entitled
to
it
he
shall
be
,
as
well
as
to
my
esteem
;
while
those
who
deserve
it
not
,
must
expect
only
compassion
from
me
,
and
my
prayers
were
they
my
brothers
or
sisters
.
'
<EOS>
Tis
true
had
I
not
been
poor
and
lowly
,
I
might
not
have
thought
thus
;
but
if
it
be
a
right
way
of
thinking
,
it
is
a
blessing
that
I
was
so
;
and
that
shall
never
be
matter
of
reproach
to
me
,
which
one
day
will
be
matter
of
justification
.
  
<EOS>
Upon
the
whole
,
I
should
think
it
advisable
,
my
dear
father
and
mother
,
to
make
such
kind
excuses
to
the
offered
service
of
my
cousins
,
as
your
better
reason
shall
suggest
to
you
;
and
to
do
any
thing
else
for
them
of
more
value
,
as
their
circumstances
may
require
,
or
occasions
offer
to
serve
them
.
  
<EOS>
But
if
the
employing
and
having
them
about
you
,
will
add
comfort
to
your
lives
,
I
give
up
entirely
my
own
opinion
,
and
doubt
not
every
thing
will
be
thought
well
of
,
that
you
shall
think
fit
to
do
.
  
<EOS>
And
so
I
conclude
with
assuring
you
,
that
I
am
,
my
ever
-
dear
parents
,
your
dutiful
and
happy
daughter
.
  
<EOS>
The
copy
of
this
letter
I
will
keep
to
myself
,
till
I
have
your
answer
,
that
you
may
be
under
no
difficulty
how
to
act
in
either
of
the
cases
mentioned
in
it
.
    
<EOS>
MY
DEAREST
DAUGHTER
,
  
<EOS>
How
shall
I
do
to
answer
,
as
they
deserve
,
your
two
last
letters
?
<EOS>
Sure
no
happy
couple
ever
had
such
a
child
as
we
have
!
<EOS>
But
it
is
in
vain
to
aim
at
words
like
yours
:
and
equally
in
vain
for
us
to
offer
to
set
forth
the
thankfulness
of
our
hearts
,
on
the
kind
office
your
honoured
husband
has
given
us
;
for
no
reason
but
to
favour
us
still
more
,
and
to
quiet
our
minds
in
the
notion
of
being
useful
to
him
.
<EOS>
God
grant
I
may
be
able
to
be
so
!
 
<EOS>
Happy
<EOS>
shall
I
be
,
if
I
can
!
<EOS>
But
I
see
the
generous
drift
of
his
proposal
;
it
is
only
to
make
me
more
easy
from
the
nature
of
my
employment
,
and
,
in
my
mind
too
,
over
-
loaded
as
I
may
say
,
with
benefits
;
and
at
the
same
time
to
make
me
more
respected
in
my
new
neighbourhood
.
  
<EOS>
I
can
only
say
,
I
most
gratefully
accept
of
the
kind
offer
;
and
since
it
will
ease
the
worthy
Mr.
Longman
,
shall
with
still
greater
pleasure
do
all
I
can
in
it
.
<EOS>
But
I
doubt
I
shall
want
ability
;
but
I
will
be
just
and
honest
,
however
.
<EOS>
That
,
by
God
's
grace
,
will
be
within
my
own
capacity
;
and
that
,
I
hope
,
I
may
answer
for
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
kind
,
indeed
,
to
put
it
in
my
power
to
do
good
to
those
who
shall
deserve
it
;
and
I
will
take
double
pains
to
find
out
the
true
merit
of
such
as
I
shall
recommend
to
favour
,
and
that
their
circumstances
be
really
such
as
I
shall
represent
them
.
  
<EOS>
But
one
thing
let
me
desire
,
that
I
make
up
my
accounts
to
Mr.
Longman
,
or
to
his
honour
himself
,
when
he
shall
be
here
with
us
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
how
-
<EOS>
but
it
will
make
me
uneasy
,
if
I
am
to
make
up
my
accounts
to
you
:
for
so
well
known
is
your
love
to
us
,
that
though
you
would
no
more
do
an
unjust
thing
,
than
,
by
God
's
grace
,
we
should
desire
you
;
yet
this
same
ill
-
willing
world
might
think
it
was
like
making
up
accounts
to
one
's
self
.
  
<EOS>
Do
,
my
dearest
child
,
get
me
off
this
difficulty
,
and
I
can
have
no
other
;
for
already
I
am
in
hopes
I
have
hit
upon
a
contrivance
to
improve
the
estate
,
and
to
better
the
condition
of
the
tenants
,
at
least
not
to
worst
them
,
and
which
,
I
hope
,
will
please
every
body
;
but
I
will
acquaint
Mr.
Longman
with
this
,
and
take
his
advice
;
for
I
will
not
be
too
troublesome
either
to
you
,
my
dear
child
,
or
to
your
spouse
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
could
act
so
for
his
interest
,
as
not
to
be
a
burden
,
what
happy
creatures
should
we
both
be
in
our
own
minds
!
 
<EOS>
We
find
ourselves
more
and
more
respected
by
every
one
;
and
so
far
as
shall
be
consistent
with
our
new
trust
,
we
will
endeavour
to
deserve
it
,
that
we
may
interest
as
many
as
know
us
in
our
own
good
wishes
and
prayers
for
the
happiness
of
you
both
.
  
<EOS>
But
let
me
say
,
how
much
convinced
I
am
by
your
reasons
for
not
taking
to
us
any
of
our
relations
.
<EOS>
Every
one
of
those
reasons
has
its
force
with
us
.
<EOS>
How
happy
are
we
to
have
so
prudent
a
daughter
to
advise
with
!
<EOS>
And
I
think
myself
obliged
to
promise
this
,
that
whatever
I
do
for
any
of
them
above
the
amount
of
 
forty
shillings
at
one
time
,
I
will
take
your
direction
in
it
,
that
your
wise
hints
,
of
making
every
one
continue
their
industry
,
and
not
to
rely
upon
favour
instead
of
merit
,
may
be
followed
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
this
is
the
way
to
make
them
happier
as
well
as
better
men
and
women
;
for
,
as
I
have
often
thought
,
if
one
were
to
have
a
hundred
pounds
a
year
,
it
would
not
do
without
industry
;
and
with
it
,
one
may
do
with
a
quarter
of
it
,
and
less
.
  
<EOS>
In
short
,
my
dear
child
,
your
reasons
are
so
good
,
that
I
wonder
they
came
not
into
my
head
before
,
and
then
I
needed
not
to
have
troubled
you
about
the
matter
:
but
yet
it
ran
in
my
own
thought
,
that
I
could
not
like
to
be
an
encroacher
:
 
<EOS>
for
I
hate
a
dirty
thing
;
and
,
in
the
midst
of
my
distresses
,
never
could
be
guilty
of
one
.
<EOS>
Thank
God
for
it
.
  
<EOS>
You
rejoice
our
hearts
beyond
expression
at
the
hope
you
give
us
of
receiving
letters
from
you
now
-
and
<EOS>
-
then
:
it
will
be
the
chief
comfort
of
our
lives
,
next
to
seeing
you
,
as
we
expect
we
sometimes
shall
.
<EOS>
But
yet
,
my
dear
child
,
do
n't
let
us
inconvenience
you
neither
.
<EOS>
Pray
do
n't
;
you
'll
have
enough
upon
your
hands
without
 
to
be
sure
you
will
.
  
<EOS>
The
workmen
have
made
a
good
progress
,
and
wish
for
Mr.
Longman
to
come
down
;
as
we
also
do
.
  
<EOS>
You
need
not
be
afraid
we
should
think
you
proud
,
or
lifted
up
with
your
condition
.
<EOS>
You
have
weathered
the
first
dangers
,
and
but
for
your
fine
clothes
and
jewels
,
we
should
not
see
any
difference
between
our
dear
Pamela
and
the
much
respected
Mrs.
B.
<EOS>
But
God
has
given
you
too
much
sense
to
be
proud
or
lifted
up
.
<EOS>
I
remember
,
in
your
former
writings
,
a
saying
of
your
"
squire
's
,
speaking
of
you
,
that
it
was
for
persons
not
used
to
praise
,
and
who
did
not
deserve
it
,
to
be
proud
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
Every
day
brings
us
instances
of
the
good
name
his
honour
and
you
,
my
dear
child
,
have
left
behind
you
in
this
country
.
<EOS>
Here
comes
one
,
and
then
another
,
and
a
third
,
and
a
fourth
;
  
"
Goodman
Andrews
,
"
cries
one
,
and
,
"
Goody
Andrews
,
"
cries
another
(
and
some
call
us
Mr.
and
Mrs.
,
but
we
like
the
other
full
as
well
)
"
when
heard
you
from
his
honour
?
<EOS>
How
does
his
lady
do
?
 
<EOS>
What
a
charming
couple
are
they
!
 
<EOS>
How
lovingly
do
they
live
!
 
<EOS>
What
an
example
do
they
give
to
all
about
them
!
"
<EOS>
Then
one
cries
,
"
God
bless
them
both
,
"
and
another
cries
,
"
Amen
;
"
and
so
says
a
third
and
a
fourth
;
and
all
say
,
"
<EOS>
But
when
do
you
expect
them
down
again
?
 
<EOS>
Such
-
a
-
one
longs
to
see
'em
 
and
will
ride
a
day
's
journey
,
to
have
but
a
sight
of
'em
at
church
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
then
they
say
,
"
How
this
gentleman
praises
them
,
and
that
lady
admires
them
.
"
 
<EOS>
O
what
a
happiness
is
this
!
<EOS>
How
do
your
poor
mother
<EOS>
and
I
stand
fixed
to
the
earth
to
hear
both
your
praises
,
our
tears
trickling
down
our
cheeks
,
and
our
hearts
heaving
as
if
they
would
burst
with
joy
,
till
we
are
forced
to
take
leave
in
half
words
,
and
hand
-
in
-
hand
go
in
together
to
bless
God
,
and
bless
you
both
.
<EOS>
O
my
daughter
,
what
a
happy
couple
have
God
and
you
made
us
!
  
<EOS>
Your
poor
mother
is
very
anxious
about
her
dear
child
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
touch
upon
a
matter
so
very
irksome
to
you
to
hear
of
.
<EOS>
But
,
though
the
time
may
be
some
months
off
,
she
every
hour
prays
for
your
safety
and
happiness
,
and
all
the
increase
of
felicity
that
his
honour
's
generous
heart
can
wish
for
.
 
<EOS>
That
is
all
we
will
say
at
present
;
only
,
that
we
are
,
with
continued
prayers
and
blessings
,
my
dearest
child
,
your
loving
father
and
mother
,
  
J.
and
E.
ANDREWS

<EOS>
From
Lady
Davers
to
Mrs.
B.
  
MY
DEAR
PAMELA
,
  
I
intended
to
have
been
with
you
before
this
:
but
my
lord
has
been
a
little
indisposed
with
the
gout
,
and
Jackey
has
had
an
intermitting
fever
:
but
they
are
pretty
well
recovered
,
and
it
shall
not
be
long
before
I
see
you
,
<EOS>
now
I
understand
you
are
returned
from
your
Kentish
expedition
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
been
exceedingly
diverted
with
your
papers
.
<EOS>
You
have
given
us
,
by
their
means
,
many
a
delightful
hour
,
that
otherwise
would
have
hung
heavy
upon
us
;
and
we
are
all
charmed
with
you
.
<EOS>
Lady
Betty
,
and
her
noble
mamma
,
has
been
of
our
party
,
whenever
we
have
read
your
accounts
.
<EOS>
She
is
a
dear
generous
lady
,
and
has
shed
with
us
many
a
tear
over
them
;
and
my
lord
has
not
been
unmoved
,
nor
Jackey
neither
,
at
some
of
your
distresses
and
reflections
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
Pamela
,
you
are
a
charming
creature
,
and
an
ornament
to
your
sex
.
<EOS>
We
wanted
to
have
had
you
among
us
a
hundred
times
,
as
we
read
,
that
we
might
have
loved
,
and
kissed
,
and
thanked
you
.
  
<EOS>
But
after
all
,
my
brother
,
generous
and
noble
as
he
seemed
,
when
your
trials
were
over
,
was
a
strange
wicked
young
fellow
;
and
happy
it
was
for
you
both
,
that
he
was
so
cleverly
caught
in
the
trap
he
had
laid
for
your
virtue
.
  
<EOS>
I
can
assure
you
,
my
lord
longs
to
see
you
,
and
will
accompany
me
;
for
,
he
says
,
he
has
but
a
faint
idea
of
your
person
.
<EOS>
I
tell
him
,
and
them
all
,
that
you
are
the
finest
girl
,
and
the
most
improved
in
person
and
mind
,
I
ever
beheld
;
and
I
am
not
afraid
although
they
should
imagine
all
they
can
in
your
favour
,
from
my
account
,
that
they
will
be
disappointed
when
they
see
and
converse
with
you
.
<EOS>
But
one
thing
more
you
must
do
,
and
then
we
will
love
you
still
more
;
and
that
is
,
send
us
the
rest
of
your
papers
,
down
to
your
marriage
at
least
;
and
farther
,
it
you
have
written
farther
;
for
we
all
long
to
see
the
rest
,
as
you
relate
it
,
though
we
know
in
general
what
has
passed
.
  
<EOS>
You
leave
off
with
an
account
of
an
angry
letter
I
wrote
to
my
brother
,
to
persuade
him
to
give
you
your
liberty
,
and
a
sum
of
money
;
not
doubting
but
his
designs
would
end
in
your
ruin
,
and
,
I
own
,
not
wishing
he
would
marry
you
;
for
little
did
I
know
of
your
merit
and
excellence
,
nor
could
I
,
but
for
your
letters
so
lately
sent
me
,
have
had
any
notion
of
either
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
question
,
but
if
you
have
recited
my
passionate
behaviour
to
you
,
when
at
the
hall
,
I
shall
make
a
ridiculous
figure
enough
;
but
I
will
forgive
all
that
,
for
the
sake
of
the
pleasure
you
have
given
me
,
and
will
still
farther
give
me
,
if
you
comply
with
my
request
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Betty
says
,
it
is
the
best
story
she
has
heard
,
and
the
most
instructive
;
and
she
longs
to
have
the
conclusion
of
it
in
your
own
words
.
<EOS>
She
says
now
<EOS>
and
then
,
"
What
a
hopeful
brother
you
have
,
Lady
Davers
!
<EOS>
O
these
intriguing
gentlemen
!
 
<EOS>
What
rogueries
do
they
not
commit
!
<EOS>
I
should
have
had
a
fine
husband
of
him
,
had
I
received
your
proposal
!
<EOS>
The
dear
Pamela
would
have
run
in
his
head
,
and
had
I
been
the
first
lady
in
the
kingdom
<EOS>
,
I
should
have
stood
but
a
poor
chance
in
his
esteem
;
for
,
you
see
,
his
designs
upon
her
began
early
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
says
,
you
had
a
good
heart
to
go
back
again
to
him
,
when
the
violent
wretch
had
driven
you
from
him
on
such
a
slight
occasion
:
<EOS>
but
yet
,
she
thinks
the
reasons
you
give
in
your
relation
,
and
your
love
for
him
(
which
then
you
began
to
discover
was
your
case
)
,
as
well
as
the
event
,
shewed
you
did
right
.
  
<EOS>
But
we
'll
tell
you
all
our
judgments
,
when
we
have
read
the
rest
of
your
accounts
.
<EOS>
So
pray
send
them
as
soon
as
you
can
,
to
(
I
wo
n't
write
myself
sister
till
then
)
<EOS>
your
affectionate
,
&
c.
  
B.
DAVERS
.
    
<EOS>
My
good
dear
Lady
,
  
You
have
done
me
great
honour
in
the
letter
your
ladyship
has
been
pleased
to
send
me
;
and
it
is
a
high
pleasure
to
me
,
now
all
is
so
happily
over
,
that
my
poor
papers
in
the
least
diverted
you
,
and
such
honourable
and
worthy
persons
as
your
ladyship
mentions
.
<EOS>
I
could
wish
I
might
be
favoured
with
such
remarks
on
my
conduct
,
so
nakedly
set
forth
(
without
any
imagination
that
they
would
ever
appear
in
such
an
assembly
)
,
as
may
be
of
use
to
me
in
my
future
life
,
and
thus
make
me
more
worthy
than
it
is
otherwise
possible
<EOS>
I
can
be
,
of
the
honour
to
which
I
am
raised
.
<EOS>
Do
,
dearest
lady
,
favour
me
so
far
.
<EOS>
I
am
prepared
to
receive
blame
,
and
to
benefit
by
it
,
and
can
not
expect
praise
so
much
from
my
actions
as
from
my
intentions
;
for
indeed
,
these
were
always
just
and
honourable
:
but
why
,
even
for
these
do
I
talk
of
praise
,
since
,
being
prompted
by
impulses
I
could
not
resist
,
it
can
be
no
merit
in
me
to
have
been
governed
by
them
?
  
<EOS>
As
to
the
papers
following
those
in
your
hands
,
when
I
say
,
that
they
must
needs
appear
impertinent
to
such
judges
,
after
what
you
know
,
I
dare
say
,
your
ladyship
will
not
insist
upon
them
:
yet
I
will
not
scruple
briefly
to
mention
what
they
contain
.
  
<EOS>
All
my
dangers
and
trials
were
happily
at
an
end
:
so
that
they
only
contain
the
conversations
that
passed
between
your
ladyship
's
generous
brother
and
me
;
his
kind
assurances
of
honourable
love
to
me
;
my
acknowledgments
of
unworthiness
to
him
;
Mrs.
Jewkes
's
respectful
change
of
behaviour
towards
me
;
Mr.
B.
's
reconciliation
to
Mr.
Williams
;
his
introducing
me
to
the
good
families
in
the
neighbourhood
,
and
avowing
before
them
his
honourable
intentions
.
<EOS>
A
visit
from
my
honest
father
,
who
(
not
knowing
what
to
conclude
from
my
letter
to
him
before
I
returned
to
your
honoured
brother
,
desiring
my
papers
from
him
)
came
in
great
anxiety
of
heart
to
know
the
worst
,
doubting
I
had
at
last
been
caught
by
a
stratagem
,
ending
in
my
ruin
.
<EOS>
His
joyful
surprise
to
find
how
happy
I
was
likely
to
be
.
<EOS>
All
the
hopes
given
me
,
answered
by
the
private
celebration
of
our
nuptials
 
an
honour
so
much
above
all
that
my
utmost
ambition
could
make
me
aspire
to
,
and
which
I
never
can
deserve
!
<EOS>
Your
ladyship
's
arrival
,
and
anger
,
not
knowing
<EOS>
I
was
actually
married
,
but
supposing
me
a
vile
wicked
creature
;
in
which
case
I
should
have
deserved
the
worst
of
usage
.
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
's
angry
lessons
to
me
,
for
daring
to
interfere
;
though
I
thought
in
the
tenderest
and
most
dutiful
manner
,
between
your
ladyship
and
himself
.
<EOS>
The
most
acceptable
goodness
and
favour
of
your
ladyship
afterwards
to
me
,
of
which
,
as
becomes
me
,
I
shall
ever
retain
the
most
grateful
sense
.
<EOS>
My
return
to
this
sweet
mansion
in
a
manner
so
different
from
my
quitting
it
,
where
I
had
been
so
happy
for
four
years
,
in
paying
my
duty
to
the
best
of
mistresses
,
your
ladyship
's
excellent
mother
,
to
whose
goodness
,
in
taking
me
from
my
poor
honest
parents
,
and
giving
me
what
education
I
have
,
I
owe
,
under
God
,
my
happiness
.
<EOS>
The
joy
of
good
Mrs.
Jervis
,
Mr.
Longman
,
and
all
the
servants
,
on
this
occasion
.
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
's
acquainting
me
with
Miss
Godfrey
's
affair
,
and
presenting
to
me
the
pretty
Miss
Goodwin
,
at
the
dairy
-
house
.
<EOS>
Our
appearance
at
church
;
the
favour
of
the
gentry
in
the
neighbourhood
,
who
,
knowing
your
ladyship
had
not
disdained
to
look
upon
me
,
and
to
be
favourable
to
me
,
came
the
more
readily
into
a
neighbourly
intimacy
with
me
,
and
still
so
much
the
more
readily
,
as
the
continued
kindness
of
my
dear
benefactor
,
and
his
condescending
deportment
to
me
before
them
(
as
if
I
had
been
worthy
of
the
honour
done
me
)
,
did
credit
to
his
own
generous
act
.
  
<EOS>
These
,
my
lady
,
down
to
my
good
parents
setting
out
to
this
place
,
in
order
to
be
settled
,
by
my
honoured
benefactor
's
bounty
,
in
the
Kentish
farm
,
are
the
most
material
contents
of
my
remaining
papers
:
and
though
they
might
be
the
most
agreeable
to
those
for
whom
only
they
were
written
,
yet
,
as
they
were
principally
matters
of
course
,
after
what
your
ladyship
has
with
you
;
as
the
joy
of
my
fond
heart
can
be
better
judged
of
by
your
ladyship
than
described
by
me
;
and
as
you
are
acquainted
with
all
the
particulars
that
can
be
worthy
of
any
other
person
's
notice
but
<EOS>
my
dear
parents
:
I
am
sure
your
ladyship
will
dispense
with
your
commands
;
and
I
make
it
my
humble
request
that
you
will
.
  
<EOS>
For
,
Madam
<EOS>
,
you
must
needs
think
,
that
when
my
doubts
were
dispelled
;
when
confident
all
my
trials
were
over
;
when
I
had
a
prospect
of
being
so
abundantly
rewarded
for
what
I
suffered
:
when
every
hour
rose
upon
me
with
new
delight
,
and
fraught
with
fresh
instances
of
generous
kindness
from
such
a
dear
gentleman
,
my
master
,
my
benefactor
,
the
son
of
my
honoured
lady
:
your
ladyship
must
needs
<EOS>
think
,
I
say
,
that
I
must
be
too
much
affected
,
my
heart
too
much
opened
;
and
especially
as
it
then
(
relieved
from
its
past
anxieties
and
fears
,
which
had
kept
down
and
damped
the
latent
flame
)
<EOS>
first
discovered
impressions
of
which
before
I
hardly
thought
it
susceptible
.
 
<EOS>
So
that
it
is
scarce
possible
,
that
my
joy
and
my
prudence
,
if
I
were
to
be
tried
by
such
judges
of
delicacy
and
decorum
as
Lord
and
Lady
Davers
,
the
honoured
countess
,
and
Lady
Betty
,
could
be
so
intimately
,
so
laudably
coupled
,
as
were
to
be
wished
:
although
the
continued
sense
of
my
unworthiness
,
and
the
disgrace
the
dear
gentleman
would
bring
upon
himself
by
his
generous
goodness
to
me
,
always
went
hand
in
hand
with
my
joy
and
my
prudence
;
and
what
these
considerations
took
from
the
former
,
being
added
to
the
latter
,
kept
me
steadier
and
more
equal
to
myself
,
than
otherwise
it
was
possible
such
a
young
creature
as
I
could
have
been
.
  
<EOS>
Wherefore
my
good
lady
<EOS>
,
I
hope
I
stand
excused
,
and
shall
not
bring
upon
myself
the
censure
of
being
disobedient
to
your
commands
.
  
<EOS>
Besides
,
Madam
,
since
you
inform
me
that
my
good
Lord
Davers
will
attend
you
hither
,
I
should
never
dare
to
look
his
lordship
in
the
face
,
if
all
the
emotions
of
my
heart
,
on
such
affecting
occasions
,
stood
confessed
to
his
lordship
;
and
if
I
am
ashamed
they
should
to
your
ladyship
,
to
the
countess
,
and
Lady
Betty
,
whose
goodness
must
induce
you
all
three
to
think
favourably
,
in
such
circumstances
,
of
one
who
is
of
your
own
sex
,
how
would
it
concern
me
,
for
the
same
to
appear
before
such
gentlemen
as
my
lord
and
his
nephew
?
 
<EOS>
Indeed
I
could
not
look
up
to
either
of
them
in
the
sense
of
this
.
 
<EOS>
And
give
me
leave
to
hope
,
that
some
of
the
scenes
,
in
the
letters
your
ladyship
had
,
were
not
read
to
gentlemen
;
your
ladyship
must
needs
know
which
I
mean
,
and
will
think
of
my
two
grand
trials
of
all
.
<EOS>
For
though
I
was
the
innocent
subject
of
wicked
attempts
,
and
so
can
not
,
I
hope
,
suffer
in
any
one
's
opinion
for
what
I
could
not
help
;
yet
,
for
your
dear
brother
's
sake
,
as
well
as
for
the
decency
of
the
matter
,
one
would
not
,
when
having
the
honour
to
appear
before
my
lord
and
his
nephew
,
he
looked
upon
,
methinks
,
with
that
levity
of
eye
and
thought
,
which
,
perhaps
,
hard
-
hearted
gentlemen
may
pass
upon
one
,
by
reason
of
those
very
scenes
,
which
would
move
pity
and
concern
in
a
good
lady
's
breast
,
for
a
poor
creature
so
attempted
.
  
<EOS>
So
,
my
dear
lady
,
be
pleased
to
tell
me
,
if
the
gentlemen
have
heard
all
 
<EOS>
I
hope
not
 
and
also
to
point
out
to
me
such
parts
of
my
conduct
as
deserve
blame
:
indeed
,
I
will
try
to
make
a
good
use
of
your
censure
,
and
am
sure
I
shall
be
thankful
for
it
;
for
it
will
make
me
hope
to
be
more
and
more
worthy
of
the
honour
I
have
,
of
being
exalted
into
such
a
distinguished
family
,
and
the
right
the
best
of
gentlemen
has
given
me
to
style
myself
your
ladyship
's
most
humble
,
and
most
obliged
servant
,
  
P.B.
    
From
Lady
Davers
,
in
reply
.
  
<EOS>
MY
DEAR
PAMELA
,
  
You
have
given
us
all
a
great
disappointment
in
declining
to
oblige
me
with
the
sequel
of
your
papers
.
<EOS>
I
was
a
little
out
of
humour
with
you
at
first
;
 
I
must
own
<EOS>
I
was
:
 
<EOS>
for
I
can
not
bear
denial
,
when
my
heart
is
set
upon
any
thing
.
<EOS>
But
Lady
Betty
became
your
advocate
,
and
said
,
she
thought
you
very
excusable
:
since
,
no
doubt
,
there
might
be
many
tender
things
,
circumstanced
as
you
were
,
well
enough
for
your
parents
to
see
,
but
for
nobody
else
;
and
relations
of
our
side
,
the
least
of
all
,
whose
future
intimacy
,
and
frequent
visits
,
might
give
occasions
for
raillery
and
remarks
,
not
otherwise
agreeable
.
<EOS>
I
regard
her
apology
for
you
the
more
,
because
I
knew
it
was
a
great
baulk
to
her
,
that
you
did
not
comply
with
my
request
.
<EOS>
But
now
,
child
,
when
you
know
me
more
,
you
'll
find
,
that
if
I
am
obliged
to
give
up
one
point
,
I
always
insist
on
another
,
as
near
it
as
I
can
,
in
order
to
see
if
it
be
only
one
thing
I
am
to
be
refused
,
or
every
thing
;
in
which
last
case
,
I
know
how
to
take
my
measures
,
and
resent
.
  
<EOS>
Now
this
is
what
I
insist
upon
;
that
you
correspond
with
me
the
same
as
you
did
with
your
parents
,
and
acquaint
me
with
every
passage
that
is
of
concern
to
you
;
beginning
with
your
account
how
both
of
you
spent
your
time
when
in
Kent
;
for
you
must
know
we
are
all
taken
with
your
duty
to
your
parents
,
and
the
discretion
of
the
good
couple
,
and
think
you
have
given
a
very
edifying
example
of
filial
piety
to
all
who
shall
hear
your
story
;
for
if
so
much
duty
is
owing
to
parents
,
where
nothing
can
be
done
for
one
,
how
much
more
is
it
to
be
expected
,
where
there
is
power
to
add
to
the
natural
obligation
,
all
the
comforts
and
conveniences
of
life
?
<EOS>
We
people
in
upper
life
love
to
hear
how
gratitude
and
unexpected
benefits
operate
upon
honest
minds
,
who
have
little
more
than
plain
artless
nature
for
their
guide
;
and
we
flatter
ourselves
with
the
hopes
of
many
a
delightful
hour
,
by
your
means
,
in
this
our
solitary
situation
,
if
obliged
to
pass
the
next
winter
in
it
,
as
my
lord
and
the
earl
threaten
me
,
and
the
countess
,
and
Lady
Betty
,
that
we
shall
.
<EOS>
Then
let
us
hear
of
every
thing
that
gives
you
joy
or
trouble
:
and
if
my
brother
carries
you
to
town
,
for
the
winter
,
while
he
attends
parliament
,
the
advices
you
can
give
us
of
what
passes
in
London
,
and
of
the
public
entertainments
and
diversions
he
will
take
you
to
,
related
in
your
own
artless
and
natural
observations
,
will
be
as
diverting
to
us
,
as
if
at
them
ourselves
.
<EOS>
For
a
young
creature
of
your
good
understanding
,
to
whom
all
these
things
will
be
quite
new
,
will
give
us
,
perhaps
,
a
better
taste
of
them
,
their
beauties
and
defects
,
than
we
might
have
before
;
for
we
people
of
quality
go
to
those
places
,
dressed
out
and
adorned
in
such
a
manner
,
outvying
one
another
,
as
if
we
considered
ourselves
as
so
many
parts
of
the
public
entertainment
,
and
are
too
much
pleased
with
ourselves
to
be
able
so
to
attend
to
what
we
see
,
as
to
form
a
right
judgment
of
it
;
but
some
of
us
behave
with
so
much
indifference
to
the
entertainment
,
as
if
we
thought
ourselves
above
being
diverted
by
what
we
come
to
see
,
and
as
if
our
view
was
rather
to
trifle
away
our
time
,
than
improve
ourselves
by
attending
to
the
story
of
the
action
.
  
<EOS>
See
,
Pamela
<EOS>
,
I
shall
not
make
an
unworthy
correspondent
altogether
,
for
I
can
get
into
thy
grave
way
,
and
moralize
a
little
now
<EOS>
and
then
:
and
if
you
'll
promise
to
oblige
me
by
your
constant
correspondence
in
this
way
,
and
divest
yourself
of
all
restraint
,
as
if
you
were
writing
to
your
parents
(
and
I
can
tell
you
,
you
'll
write
to
one
who
will
be
as
candid
and
as
favourable
to
you
as
they
can
be
)
,
then
I
am
sure
we
shall
have
truth
and
nature
from
you
;
and
these
are
things
which
we
are
generally
so
much
lifted
above
,
by
our
conditions
,
that
we
hardly
know
what
they
are
.
  
<EOS>
But
I
have
written
enough
for
one
letter
;
and
yet
,
having
more
to
say
,
I
will
,
after
this
,
send
another
,
without
waiting
for
your
answer
,
which
you
may
give
to
both
together
;
and
am
,
yours
,
&
c.
B.
DAVERS
.
    
<EOS>
DEAR
PAMELA
,
  
I
am
very
glad
thy
honest
man
has
let
thee
into
the
affair
of
Sally
Godfrey
.
<EOS>
But
pr'ythee
,
Pamela
,
tell
us
how
he
did
it
,
and
thy
thoughts
upon
it
,
for
that
is
a
critical
case
,
and
as
he
has
represented
it
,
so
shall
I
know
what
to
say
of
it
before
you
and
him
:
for
I
would
not
make
mischief
between
you
for
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
This
,
let
me
tell
you
,
will
be
a
trying
part
of
your
conduct
.
<EOS>
For
he
loves
the
child
,
and
will
judge
of
you
by
your
conduct
towards
it
.
<EOS>
He
dearly
loved
her
mother
;
and
notwithstanding
her
fault
,
she
well
deserved
it
:
for
she
was
a
sensible
,
ay
,
and
a
modest
lady
,
and
of
an
ancient
and
genteel
family
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
heir
to
a
noble
estate
,
was
of
a
bold
and
enterprising
spirit
,
fond
of
intrigue
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
let
this
concern
you
 
<EOS>
You
'll
have
the
greater
happiness
,
and
merit
too
,
if
you
can
hold
him
;
and
,
'
tis
my
opinion
,
if
any
body
can
,
you
will
.
<EOS>
Then
he
did
not
like
the
young
lady
's
mother
,
who
sought
artfully
to
entrap
him
.
<EOS>
So
that
the
poor
girl
,
divided
between
her
inclination
for
him
,
and
her
duty
to
her
designing
mother
,
gave
into
the
plot
upon
him
:
and
he
thought
himself
 
vile
wretch
as
he
was
for
all
that
!
 
<EOS>
at
liberty
to
set
up
plot
against
plot
,
and
the
poor
lady
's
honour
was
the
sacrifice
.
  
<EOS>
I
hope
you
spoke
well
of
her
to
him
 
<EOS>
I
hope
you
received
the
child
kindly
 
<EOS>
I
hope
you
had
presence
of
mind
to
do
this
 
<EOS>
For
it
is
a
nice
part
to
act
;
and
all
his
observations
were
up
,
I
dare
say
,
on
the
occasion
 
<EOS>
Do
let
me
hear
how
it
was
.
<EOS>
And
write
without
restraint
;
for
although
I
am
not
your
mother
,
yet
am
I
his
eldest
sister
,
you
know
,
and
as
such
 
Come
,
I
will
say
so
,
in
hopes
you
'll
oblige
me
 
your
sister
,
and
so
entitled
to
expect
a
compliance
with
my
request
:
for
is
there
not
a
duty
,
in
degree
,
to
elder
sisters
from
younger
?
  
<EOS>
As
to
our
remarks
upon
your
behaviour
,
they
have
been
much
to
your
credit
:
but
nevertheless
,
I
will
,
to
encourage
you
to
enter
into
this
requested
correspondence
with
me
,
consult
Lady
Betty
,
and
will
go
over
your
papers
again
,
and
try
to
find
fault
with
your
conduct
,
and
if
we
see
any
thing
censurable
,
will
freely
let
you
know
our
minds
.
  
<EOS>
But
,
before
-
hand
,
I
can
tell
you
,
we
shall
be
agreed
in
one
opinion
;
and
that
is
,
that
we
know
not
who
would
have
acted
as
you
have
done
,
upon
the
whole
.
<EOS>
So
,
Pamela
,
you
see
I
put
myself
upon
the
same
foot
of
correspondence
with
you
.
<EOS>
Not
that
I
will
promise
to
answer
every
latter
:
<EOS>
no
,
you
must
not
expect
that
.
<EOS>
Your
part
will
be
a
kind
of
narrative
,
purposely
designed
to
entertain
us
here
;
and
I
hope
to
receive
six
,
seven
,
eight
,
or
ten
letters
,
as
it
may
happen
,
before
I
return
one
:
but
such
a
part
I
will
bear
in
it
,
as
shall
let
you
know
our
opinion
of
your
proceedings
,
and
relations
of
things
.
<EOS>
And
as
you
wish
to
be
found
fault
with
,
you
shall
freely
have
it
(
though
not
in
a
splenetic
or
ill
-
natured
way
)
,
as
often
as
you
give
occasion
.
<EOS>
Now
,
Pamela
,
I
have
two
views
in
this
.
<EOS>
One
is
to
see
how
a
man
of
my
brother
's
spirit
,
who
has
not
denied
himself
any
genteel
liberties
(
for
it
must
be
owned
he
never
was
a
common
town
rake
,
and
had
always
a
dignity
in
his
roguery
)
,
will
behave
himself
to
you
,
and
in
wedlock
,
which
used
to
be
freely
sneered
at
by
him
;
the
next
,
that
I
may
love
you
more
and
more
as
by
your
letters
,
I
shall
be
more
and
more
acquainted
with
you
,
as
well
as
by
conversation
;
so
that
you
ca
n't
be
off
,
if
you
would
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
,
however
,
you
will
have
one
objection
to
this
;
and
that
is
,
that
your
family
affairs
will
require
your
attention
,
and
not
give
the
time
you
used
to
have
for
this
employment
.
<EOS>
But
consider
,
child
,
the
station
you
are
raised
to
does
not
require
you
to
be
quite
a
domestic
animal
.
<EOS>
You
are
lifted
up
to
the
rank
of
a
lady
,
and
you
must
act
up
to
it
,
and
not
think
of
setting
such
an
example
,
as
will
draw
upon
you
the
ill
-
will
and
censure
of
other
ladies
.
<EOS>
For
will
any
of
our
sex
visit
one
who
is
continually
employing
herself
in
such
works
as
either
must
be
a
reproach
to
herself
,
or
to
them
?
 
<EOS>
You
'll
have
nothing
to
do
but
to
give
orders
.
<EOS>
You
will
consider
yourself
as
the
task
-
mistress
,
and
the
common
herd
of
female
servants
as
so
many
negroes
directing
themselves
by
your
nod
;
or
yourself
as
the
master
-
wheel
,
in
some
beautiful
pieces
of
mechanism
,
whose
dignified
grave
motions
is
to
set
a
-
going
all
the
under
-
wheels
,
with
a
velocity
suitable
to
their
respective
parts
.
<EOS>
Let
your
servants
,
under
your
direction
,
do
all
that
relates
to
household
management
;
they
can
not
write
to
entertain
and
instruct
as
you
can
:
so
what
will
you
have
to
do
?
 
<EOS>
I
'll
answer
my
own
question
:
<EOS>
In
the
first
place
,
endeavour
to
please
your
sovereign
lord
and
master
;
and
let
me
tell
you
,
any
other
woman
in
England
,
be
her
quality
ever
so
high
,
would
have
found
enough
to
do
to
succeed
in
that
.
<EOS>
Secondly
,
to
receive
and
pay
visits
,
in
order
,
for
his
credit
as
well
as
your
own
,
to
make
your
fashionable
neighbours
fond
of
you
.
<EOS>
Then
,
thirdly
,
you
will
have
time
upon
your
hands
(
as
your
monarch
himself
rises
early
,
and
is
tolerably
regular
for
such
a
brazen
face
as
he
has
been
)
to
write
to
me
in
the
manner
I
have
mentioned
,
and
expect
;
and
I
see
plainly
,
by
your
style
,
nothing
can
be
easier
for
you
than
to
do
this
.
  
<EOS>
Thus
,
and
with
reading
,
may
your
time
be
filled
up
with
reputations
to
yourself
,
and
delight
to
others
,
till
a
fourth
employment
puts
itself
upon
you
:
and
that
is
(
shall
I
tell
you
boys
,
[
Transcriber

note

to
perpetuate
a
family
,
for
many
hundred
years
esteemed
worthy
and
eminent
,
which
,
being
now
reduced
,
in
the
direct
line
,
to
him
and
me
,
expects
it
from
you
;
or
else
let
me
tell
you
(
nor
will
I
baulk
it
)
,
my
brother
,
by
descending
to
the
wholesome
cot
 
<EOS>
excuse
me
<EOS>
,
Pamela
 
will
want
one
apology
for
his
conduct
,
be
as
excellent
as
you
may
.
  
<EOS>
I
say
this
,
child
,
not
to
reflect
upon
you
,
since
the
thing
is
done
;
for
I
love
you
dearly
,
and
will
love
you
more
and
more
 
but
to
let
you
know
what
is
expected
from
you
,
and
encourage
you
in
the
prospect
already
opening
to
you
both
,
and
to
me
,
who
have
the
welfare
of
the
family
I
sprung
from
so
much
at
heart
,
although
I
know
this
will
be
attended
with
some
anxieties
to
a
mind
so
thoughtful
and
apprehensive
as
yours
seems
to
be
.
  
<EOS>
O
<EOS>
but
this
puts
me
in
mind
of
your
solicitude
,
lest
the
gentlemen
should
have
seen
every
thing
contained
in
your
letters
-
<EOS>
But
this
I
will
particularly
speak
to
in
a
third
letter
,
having
filled
my
paper
on
all
sides
:
and
am
,
till
then
,
yours
,
&
c.
  
B.
DAVERS
.
  
<EOS>
You
see
,
and
I
hope
will
take
it
as
a
favour
,
that
I
break
the
ice
,
and
begin
first
in
the
indispensably
expected
correspondence
between
us
.
    
<EOS>
From
the
same
.
  
<EOS>
And
so
,
Pamela
,
you
are
solicitous
to
know
,
if
the
gentlemen
have
seen
every
part
of
your
papers
?
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
say
<EOS>
but
they
have
:
<EOS>
nor
,
except
in
regard
to
the
reputation
of
your
saucy
man
,
do
I
see
why
the
part
you
hint
at
might
not
be
read
by
those
to
whom
the
rest
might
be
shewn
.
  
<EOS>
I
can
tell
you
,
Lady
Betty
,
who
is
a
very
nice
and
delicate
lady
,
had
no
objection
to
any
part
,
though
read
before
men
:
only
now
and
then
crying
out
,
"
O
the
vile
man
!
 
<EOS>
See
,
Lord
Davers
,
<EOS>
what
wretches
you
men
are
!
"
<EOS>
And
,
commiserating
you
,
"
Ah
!
the
poor
Pamela
!
"
<EOS>
And
expressing
her
impatience
to
hear
how
you
escaped
at
this
time
,
and
at
that
,
and
rejoicing
in
your
escape
.
<EOS>
And
now
-
and
-
then
,
"
O
,
Lady
Davers
,
what
a
vile
brother
you
have
!
 
<EOS>
I
hate
him
perfectly
.
<EOS>
The
poor
girl
can
not
be
made
amends
for
all
this
,
though
he
has
married
her
.
<EOS>
Who
,
that
knows
these
things
of
him
,
would
wish
him
to
be
hers
,
with
all
his
advantages
of
person
,
mind
,
and
fortune
?
"
and
his
wicked
attempts
.
  
<EOS>
But
I
can
tell
you
this
,
that
except
one
had
heard
every
tittle
of
your
danger
,
how
near
you
were
to
ruin
,
and
how
little
he
stood
upon
taking
any
measures
to
effect
his
vile
purposes
,
even
daring
to
attempt
you
in
the
presence
of
a
good
woman
,
which
was
a
wickedness
that
every
wicked
man
could
not
be
guilty
of
;
I
say
,
except
one
had
known
these
things
,
one
could
not
have
judged
of
the
merit
of
your
resistance
,
and
how
shocking
those
attempts
were
to
your
virtue
,
for
that
life
itself
was
endangered
by
them
:
nor
,
let
me
tell
you
,
could
I
,
in
particular
,
have
so
well
justified
him
for
marrying
you
(
I
mean
with
respect
to
his
own
proud
and
haughty
temper
of
mind
)
,
if
there
had
been
room
to
think
he
could
have
had
you
upon
easier
terms
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
necessary
,
child
,
on
twenty
accounts
,
that
we
,
your
and
his
well
-
wishers
and
his
relations
,
should
know
that
he
had
tried
every
stratagem
to
subdue
you
to
his
purpose
,
before
he
married
you
:
and
how
would
it
have
answered
to
his
intrepid
character
,
and
pride
of
heart
,
had
we
not
been
particularly
led
into
the
nature
of
those
attempts
,
which
you
so
nobly
resisted
,
as
to
convince
us
all
,
that
you
have
deserved
the
good
fortune
you
have
met
with
,
as
well
as
all
the
kind
and
respectful
treatment
he
can
possibly
shew
you
?
  
<EOS>
Nor
ought
you
to
be
concerned
who
sees
any
the
most
tender
parts
of
your
story
,
except
,
as
I
said
,
for
his
sake
;
for
it
must
be
a
very
unvirtuous
mind
that
can
form
any
other
ideas
from
what
you
relate
than
those
of
terror
and
pity
for
you
.
<EOS>
Your
expressions
are
too
delicate
to
give
the
nicest
ear
offence
,
except
at
him
.
<EOS>
You
paint
no
scenes
but
such
as
make
his
wickedness
odious
:
and
that
gentleman
,
much
more
lady
,
must
have
a
very
corrupt
heart
,
who
could
from
such
circumstances
of
distress
,
make
any
reflections
,
but
what
should
be
to
your
honour
,
and
in
abhorrence
of
such
actions
.
<EOS>
I
am
so
convinced
of
this
,
that
by
this
rule
I
would
judge
of
any
man
's
heart
in
the
world
,
better
than
by
a
thousand
declarations
and
protestations
.
<EOS>
I
do
assure
you
,
rakish
as
Jackey
is
,
and
freely
as
I
doubt
not
that
Lord
Davers
has
formerly
lived
<EOS>
(
for
he
has
been
a
man
of
pleasure
)
,
they
gave
me
,
by
their
behaviour
on
these
tender
occasions
,
reason
to
think
they
had
more
virtue
than
not
to
be
very
apprehensive
for
your
safety
;
and
my
lord
often
exclaimed
,
that
he
could
not
have
thought
his
brother
such
a
libertine
,
neither
.
  
<EOS>
Besides
,
child
,
were
not
these
things
written
in
confidence
had
not
recited
all
you
could
recite
,
would
there
not
have
been
room
for
any
one
,
who
saw
what
you
wrote
,
to
imagine
they
had
been
still
worse
?
<EOS>
And
how
could
the
terror
be
supposed
to
have
had
such
effects
upon
you
,
as
to
endanger
your
life
,
without
imagining
you
<EOS>
had
undergone
the
worst
a
vile
man
could
offer
,
unless
you
had
told
us
what
that
was
which
he
did
offer
,
and
so
put
a
bound
,
as
it
were
,
to
one
's
fears
of
what
you
suffered
,
which
otherwise
must
have
been
injurious
to
your
purity
,
though
you
could
not
help
it
?
  
<EOS>
Moreover
,
Pamela
,
it
was
but
doing
justice
to
the
libertine
himself
to
tell
your
mother
the
whole
truth
,
<EOS>
that
she
might
know
he
was
not
so
very
abandoned
,
but
he
could
stop
short
of
the
execution
of
his
wicked
purposes
,
which
he
apprehended
,
if
pursued
,
would
destroy
the
life
,
that
,
of
all
lives
,
he
would
choose
to
preserve
;
and
you
owed
also
thus
much
to
your
parents
'
peace
of
mind
,
that
,
after
all
their
distracting
fears
for
you
,
they
might
see
they
had
reason
to
rejoice
in
an
uncontaminated
daughter
.
<EOS>
And
one
can
not
but
reflect
,
now
he
has
made
you
his
wife
,
that
it
must
be
satisfaction
to
the
wicked
man
,
as
well
as
to
yourself
,
that
he
was
not
more
guilty
than
he
was
,
nor
took
more
liberties
than
he
did
.
  
<EOS>
For
my
own
part
,
I
must
say
,
that
I
could
not
have
accounted
for
your
fits
,
by
any
descriptions
short
of
those
you
give
;
and
had
you
been
less
particular
in
the
circumstances
<EOS>
,
I
should
have
judged
he
had
been
still
worse
,
and
<EOS>
your
person
,
though
not
your
mind
,
less
pure
,
than
his
pride
would
expect
from
the
woman
he
should
marry
;
for
this
is
the
case
of
all
rakes
,
that
though
they
indulge
in
all
manner
of
libertinism
themselves
,
there
is
no
class
of
men
who
exact
greater
delicacy
from
the
persons
they
marry
,
though
they
care
not
how
bad
they
make
the
wives
,
the
sisters
,
and
daughters
of
others
.
  
<EOS>
I
will
only
add
(
and
send
all
my
three
letters
together
)
,
that
we
all
blame
you
in
some
degree
for
bearing
the
wicked
Jewkes
in
your
sight
,
after
her
most
impudent
assistance
in
his
lewd
attempt
;
much
less
,
we
think
,
ought
you
to
have
left
her
in
her
place
,
and
rewarded
her
;
for
her
vileness
could
hardly
be
equalled
by
the
worst
actions
of
the
most
abandoned
procuress
.
  
<EOS>
I
know
the
difficulties
you
labour
under
,
in
his
arbitrary
will
,
and
intercession
for
her
:
but
Lady
Betty
rightly
observes
,
that
he
knew
what
a
vile
woman
<EOS>
she
was
,
when
he
put
you
into
her
power
,
and
no
doubt
employed
her
,
being
sure
she
would
answer
all
his
purposes
:
and
that
therefore
she
should
have
had
very
little
opinion
of
the
sincerity
of
his
reformation
,
while
he
was
so
solicitous
in
keeping
her
,
and
having
her
put
upon
a
foot
,
in
the
present
on
your
nuptials
,
with
honest
Jervis
.
  
<EOS>
She
would
,
she
says
,
had
she
been
in
your
case
,
have
had
one
struggle
for
her
dismission
,
let
it
have
been
taken
as
it
would
;
and
he
that
was
so
well
pleased
with
your
virtues
,
must
have
thought
this
a
natural
consequence
of
it
,
if
he
was
in
earnest
to
reclaim
.
  
<EOS>
I
know
not
whether
you
shew
him
all
I
write
:
<EOS>
but
I
have
written
this
last
part
in
the
cover
,
as
well
for
want
of
room
,
as
that
you
may
keep
it
from
him
,
if
you
please
.
<EOS>
Though
if
you
think
it
will
serve
any
good
end
,
I
am
not
against
shewing
to
him
all
I
write
.
<EOS>
For
I
must
ever
speak
my
mind
,
though
I
were
to
smart
for
it
;
and
that
nobody
can
or
has
the
heart
to
make
me
do
,
but
<EOS>
my
bold
brother
.
<EOS>
So
,
Pamela
,
for
this
time
,
Adieu
.
    
<EOS>
MY
GOOD
LADY
,
  
<EOS>
I
am
honoured
with
your
ladyship
's
three
letters
,
the
contents
of
which
are
highly
obliging
to
me
:
<EOS>
and
I
should
be
inexcusable
if
I
did
not
comply
with
your
injunctions
,
and
be
very
proud
and
thankful
for
your
ladyship
's
condescension
in
accepting
of
my
poor
scribble
,
and
promising
such
a
rich
and
valuable
return
;
of
which
you
have
already
given
such
ample
and
delightful
instances
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
plead
my
defects
,
to
excuse
my
obedience
.
<EOS>
I
only
fear
that
the
awe
which
will
be
always
upon
me
,
when
I
write
to
your
ladyship
,
will
lay
me
under
so
great
a
restraint
,
that
I
shall
fall
short
even
of
the
merit
my
papers
have
already
made
for
me
,
through
your
kind
indulgence
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
,
sheltering
myself
under
your
goodness
,
I
will
cheerfully
comply
with
every
thing
your
ladyship
expects
from
me
,
that
it
is
in
my
power
to
do
.
  
<EOS>
You
will
give
me
leave
,
Madam
,
to
put
into
some
little
method
,
the
particulars
of
what
you
desire
of
me
,
that
I
may
speak
to
them
all
:
for
,
since
you
are
so
good
as
to
excuse
me
from
sending
the
rest
of
my
papers
(
which
indeed
would
not
bear
in
many
places
)
,
I
will
omit
nothing
that
shall
tend
to
convince
you
of
my
readiness
to
obey
you
in
every
thing
else
.
  
<EOS>
First
,
then
,
your
ladyship
would
have
the
particulars
of
the
happy
fortnight
we
passed
in
Kent
,
on
one
of
the
most
agreeable
occasions
that
could
befall
me
.
  
<EOS>
Secondly
,
an
account
of
the
manner
in
which
your
dear
brother
acquainted
me
with
the
affecting
story
of
Miss
Godfrey
,
and
my
behaviour
upon
it
.
  
<EOS>
And
,
thirdly
,
I
presume
your
ladyship
,
and
Lady
Betty
,
expect
me
to
say
something
upon
your
welcome
remarks
on
my
conduct
towards
Mrs.
Jewkes
.
  
<EOS>
The
other
particulars
your
ladyship
mentions
,
will
naturally
fall
under
one
or
other
of
these
three
heads
 
But
expect
not
,
my
lady
,
though
I
begin
in
method
thus
,
that
I
shall
keep
up
to
it
.
<EOS>
If
you
will
not
allow
for
me
,
and
keep
in
view
the
poor
Pamela
Andrews
in
all
I
write
,
but
have
Mrs.
B.
in
your
eye
,
what
will
become
of
me
?
 
<EOS>
But
I
promise
myself
so
much
improvement
from
this
correspondence
,
that
I
enter
upon
it
with
a
greater
delight
than
I
can
express
,
notwithstanding
the
mingled
awe
and
diffidence
that
will
accompany
me
,
in
every
part
of
the
agreeable
task
.
<EOS>
To
begin
with
the
first
article
:
  
<EOS>
Your
dear
brother
and
my
honest
parents
<EOS>
(
I
know
your
ladyship
will
expect
from
me
,
that
on
all
occasions
I
should
speak
of
them
with
the
duty
that
becomes
a
good
child
)
with
myself
,
set
out
on
the
Monday
morning
for
Kent
,
passing
through
St.
Albans
to
London
,
at
both
which
places
we
stopped
a
night
;
for
our
dear
benefactor
would
make
us
take
easy
journeys
:
and
on
Wednesday
evening
we
arrived
at
the
sweet
place
allotted
for
the
good
couple
.
<EOS>
We
were
attended
only
by
Abraham
and
John
,
on
horseback
:
for
Mr.
Colbrand
,
having
sprained
his
foot
,
was
in
the
travelling
-
coach
,
with
the
cook
,
the
housemaid
,
and
Polly
Barlow
,
a
genteel
new
servant
,
whom
Mrs.
Brooks
recommended
to
wait
on
me
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Longman
had
been
there
a
fortnight
,
employed
in
settling
the
terms
of
an
additional
purchase
of
this
pretty
well
-
wooded
and
well
-
watered
estate
:
and
his
account
of
his
proceedings
was
very
satisfactory
to
his
honoured
principal
.
<EOS>
He
told
us
,
he
had
much
ado
to
dissuade
the
tenants
from
pursuing
a
formed
resolution
of
meeting
their
landlord
on
horseback
,
at
some
miles
distance
;
for
he
had
informed
them
when
he
expected
us
;
but
knowing
how
desirous
Mr.
B.
was
of
being
retired
,
he
had
ventured
to
assure
them
,
that
when
every
thing
was
settled
,
and
the
new
purchase
actually
entered
upon
,
they
would
have
his
presence
among
them
often
;
and
that
he
would
introduce
them
all
at
different
times
to
their
worthy
landlord
,
before
we
left
the
country
.
  
<EOS>
The
house
is
large
,
and
very
commodious
;
and
we
found
every
thing
about
it
,
and
in
it
,
exceeding
neat
and
convenient
;
owing
to
the
worthy
Mr.
Longman
's
care
and
direction
.
<EOS>
The
ground
is
well
-
stocked
,
the
barns
and
outhouses
in
excellent
repair
;
and
my
poor
parents
have
only
to
wish
,
that
they
and
I
may
be
deserving
of
half
the
goodness
we
experience
from
your
bountiful
brother
.
  
<EOS>
But
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
Madam
,
I
have
the
pleasure
of
discovering
every
day
more
and
more
,
that
there
is
not
a
better
disposed
and
more
generous
man
in
the
world
than
himself
,
for
I
verily
think
he
has
not
been
so
careful
to
conceal
his
bad
actions
as
his
good
ones
.
<EOS>
His
heart
is
naturally
beneficent
,
and
his
beneficence
is
the
gift
of
God
for
the
most
excellent
purposes
,
as
I
have
often
freely
told
him
.
<EOS>
Pardon
me
,
my
dear
lady
<EOS>
;
I
wish
I
may
not
be
impertinently
grave
:
but
I
find
a
great
many
instances
of
his
considerate
charity
,
which
few
knew
of
,
and
which
,
since
I
have
been
his
almoner
,
could
not
avoid
coming
to
my
knowledge
.
<EOS>
But
this
,
possibly
,
is
no
news
to
your
ladyship
.
<EOS>
Every
body
knows
the
generous
goodness
of
your
own
heart
:
every
one
wanting
relief
tasted
the
bounty
of
your
excellent
mother
<EOS>
my
late
honoured
lady
:
so
that
'
tis
a
family
grace
,
and
I
have
no
need
to
speak
of
it
to
you
.
<EOS>
Madam
.
  
<EOS>
This
can
not
,
I
hope
,
be
construed
as
if
I
would
hereby
suppose
ourselves
less
obliged
.
<EOS>
I
know
nothing
so
godlike
in
human
nature
as
this
disposition
to
do
good
to
our
fellow
-
creatures
:
for
is
it
not
following
immediately
the
example
of
that
generous
Providence
which
every
minute
is
conferring
blessings
upon
us
all
,
and
by
giving
power
to
the
rich
,
makes
them
but
the
dispensers
of
its
benefits
to
those
that
want
them
?
<EOS>
Yet
,
as
there
are
but
too
many
objects
of
compassion
,
and
as
the
most
beneficent
can
not
,
like
Omnipotence
,
do
good
to
all
,
how
much
are
they
obliged
who
are
distinguished
from
others!-And
<EOS>
this
being
kept
in
mind
,
will
always
contribute
to
make
the
benefited
receive
,
as
thankfully
as
they
ought
,
the
favours
of
the
obliger
.
  
<EOS>
I
know
not
if
I
write
to
be
understood
,
in
all
I
mean
;
but
my
grateful
heart
is
so
over
-
filled
when
on
this
subject
,
that
methinks
I
want
to
say
a
great
deal
more
at
the
same
time
that
I
am
apprehensive
<EOS>
I
say
too
much
.
<EOS>
Yet
,
perhaps
,
the
copies
of
the
letters
I
here
inclose
(
that
marked
[
I.
]
written
by
me
to
my
parents
,
on
our
return
to
Kent
;
that
marked
[
II
.
]
<EOS>
from
my
dear
father
in
answer
to
it
;
and
that
marked
[
III
.
]
<EOS>
mine
in
reply
to
his
)
<EOS>
will
(
at
the
same
time
that
they
may
convince
your
ladyship
that
I
will
conceal
nothing
from
you
in
the
course
of
this
correspondence
,
which
may
in
the
least
amuse
and
divert
you
,
or
better
explain
our
grateful
sentiments
)
,
in
a
great
measure
,
answer
what
your
ladyship
expects
from
me
,
as
to
the
happy
fortnight
we
passed
in
Kent
.
  
<EOS>
I
will
now
conclude
,
choosing
to
suspend
the
correspondence
,
till
I
know
from
your
ladyship
,
whether
it
will
not
be
too
low
,
too
idle
for
your
attention
;
whether
you
will
not
dispense
with
your
own
commands
when
you
see
I
am
so
little
likely
to
answer
what
you
may
possibly
expect
from
me
:
or
whether
,
if
you
insist
upon
my
scribbling
,
you
would
have
me
write
in
any
other
way
,
be
less
tedious
,
less
serious
-
in
short
,
less
or
more
any
thing
.
<EOS>
For
all
that
is
in
my
power
,
your
ladyship
may
command
from
,
Madam
,
your
obliged
and
faithful
servant
.
  
<EOS>
P.B.
  
Your
dearest
brother
,
from
whose
knowledge
I
would
not
keep
any
thing
that
shall
take
up
any
considerable
portion
of
my
time
,
gives
me
leave
to
proceed
in
this
correspondence
,
if
you
command
it
;
and
is
pleased
to
say
,
he
will
content
himself
to
see
such
parts
of
it
,
and
only
such
parts
,
<EOS>
as
I
shall
shew
him
,
or
read
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
Is
not
this
very
good
,
Madam
?
 
<EOS>
O
,
my
lady
,
you
do
n't
know
how
happy
I
am
!
    
<EOS>
From
Lady
Davers
to
Mrs.
<EOS>
B.
  
My
dear
Pamela
,
  
You
very
much
oblige
me
by
your
cheerful
compliance
with
my
request
<EOS>
:
I
leave
it
entirely
to
you
to
write
as
you
shall
be
in
the
humour
,
when
you
take
up
your
pen
;
and
then
I
shall
have
you
write
with
less
restraint
:
<EOS>
for
,
you
must
know
,
that
what
we
admire
in
you
,
are
truth
and
nature
,
not
studied
or
elaborate
epistles
.
<EOS>
We
can
hear
at
church
,
or
read
in
our
closets
,
fifty
good
things
that
we
expect
not
from
you
:
but
we
can
not
receive
from
any
body
else
the
pleasure
of
sentiments
flowing
with
that
artless
ease
,
which
so
much
affects
us
when
we
read
your
letters
.
<EOS>
Then
,
my
sweet
girl
,
your
gratitude
,
prudence
,
integrity
of
heart
,
your
humility
,
shine
so
much
in
all
your
letters
and
thoughts
,
that
no
wonder
my
brother
loves
you
as
he
does
.
  
<EOS>
But
I
shall
make
you
proud
,
I
doubt
,
and
so
by
praise
ruin
those
graces
which
we
admire
,
and
,
but
for
that
,
can
not
praise
you
too
much
.
<EOS>
In
my
conscience
,
if
thou
canst
hold
as
thou
hast
begun
,
I
believe
thou
wilt
have
him
all
to
thyself
;
and
that
was
more
than
I
once
thought
any
woman
on
this
side
<EOS>
the
seventieth
year
of
his
age
would
ever
be
able
to
say
.
<EOS>
The
letters
to
and
from
your
parents
,
we
are
charmed
with
,
and
the
communicating
of
them
to
me
,
I
take
to
be
as
great
an
instance
of
your
confidence
in
me
,
as
it
is
of
your
judgment
and
prudence
;
for
you
can
not
but
think
,
that
we
,
his
relations
,
are
a
little
watchful
over
your
conduct
,
and
have
our
eyes
upon
you
,
to
observe
what
use
you
are
likely
to
make
of
your
power
over
your
man
,
with
respect
to
your
own
relations
.
  
<EOS>
Hitherto
all
is
unexampled
prudence
,
and
you
take
the
right
method
to
reconcile
even
the
proudest
of
us
to
your
marriage
,
and
make
us
not
only
love
you
,
but
respect
your
parents
:
for
their
honesty
will
,
I
perceive
,
be
their
distinguishing
character
,
and
they
will
not
forget
themselves
,
nor
their
former
condition
.
  
<EOS>
I
can
tell
you
,
you
are
exactly
right
;
for
if
you
were
to
be
an
encroacher
,
as
the
good
old
man
calls
it
,
my
brother
would
be
the
first
to
see
it
,
and
would
gradually
think
less
and
less
of
you
,
till
possibly
he
might
come
to
despise
you
,
and
to
repent
of
his
choice
:
for
the
least
shadow
of
an
imposition
,
or
low
cunning
,
or
mere
selfishness
,
he
can
not
bear
.
  
<EOS>
In
short
,
you
are
a
charming
girl
;
and
Lady
Betty
says
so
too
;
and
moreover
adds
,
that
if
he
makes
you
not
the
best
and
faithfullest
of
husbands
,
he
can
not
deserve
you
,
for
all
his
fortune
and
birth
.
<EOS>
And
in
my
heart
,
I
begin
to
think
so
too
.
  
<EOS>
But
wo
n't
you
oblige
me
with
the
sequel
of
your
letter
to
your
father
?
<EOS>
For
,
you
promise
,
my
dear
charming
scribbler
,
in
that
you
sent
me
,
to
write
again
to
his
letter
;
and
I
long
to
see
how
you
answer
the
latter
part
of
it
,
about
your
relations
desiring
already
to
come
and
live
with
him
.
<EOS>
I
know
what
I
expect
from
you
.
<EOS>
But
let
it
be
what
it
will
,
send
it
to
me
exactly
as
you
wrote
it
;
and
I
shall
see
whether
I
have
reason
to
praise
or
reprove
you
.
<EOS>
For
surely
,
Pamela
,
you
must
leave
one
room
to
blame
you
for
something
.
<EOS>
Indeed
I
can
hardly
bear
the
thought
,
that
you
should
so
much
excel
as
you
do
,
and
have
more
prudence
,
by
nature
,
as
it
were
,
than
the
best
of
us
get
in
a
course
of
the
genteelest
educations
and
with
fifty
advantages
,
at
least
,
in
conversation
,
that
you
could
not
have
,
by
reason
of
my
mother
's
retired
life
,
while
you
were
with
her
,
and
your
close
attendance
on
her
person
.
  
<EOS>
But
I
'll
tell
you
what
has
been
a
great
improvement
to
you
;
it
is
your
own
writings
.
<EOS>
This
itch
of
scribbling
has
been
a
charming
help
.
<EOS>
For
here
,
having
a
natural
fund
of
good
sense
,
and
prudence
above
your
years
,
you
have
,
with
the
observations
these
have
enabled
you
to
make
<EOS>
,
been
flint
and
steel
too
,
as
I
may
say
,
to
yourself
:
so
that
you
have
struck
fire
when
you
pleased
,
wanting
nothing
but
a
few
dry
leaves
,
like
the
first
pair
in
old
Du
Bartas
,
to
serve
as
tinder
to
catch
your
animating
sparks
.
<EOS>
So
that
reading
constantly
,
and
thus
using
yourself
to
write
,
and
enjoying
besides
a
good
memory
,
every
thing
you
heard
and
read
became
your
own
;
and
not
only
so
,
but
was
improved
by
passing
through
more
salubrious
ducts
and
vehicles
;
like
some
fine
fruit
grafted
upon
a
common
free
-
stock
,
whose
more
exuberant
juices
serve
to
bring
to
quicker
and
greater
perfection
the
downy
peach
,
or
the
smooth
nectarine
,
with
its
crimson
blush
.
  
<EOS>
Really
,
Pamela
,
I
believe
,
I
,
too
,
shall
improve
by
writing
to
you
-
<EOS>
Why
,
you
dear
saucy
-
face
,
at
this
rate
,
you
'll
make
every
one
that
converses
with
you
,
better
,
and
wiser
,
and
wittier
too
,
as
far
as
I
know
,
than
they
ever
before
thought
there
was
room
for
'em
to
be
.
  
<EOS>
As
to
my
own
part
,
I
begin
to
like
what
I
have
written
myself
,
I
think
;
and
your
correspondence
may
revive
the
poetical
ideas
that
used
to
fire
my
mind
,
before
I
entered
into
the
drowsy
married
life
;
for
my
good
Lord
Davers
's
turn
happens
not
to
be
to
books
;
and
so
by
degrees
my
imagination
was
in
a
manner
quenched
,
and
I
,
as
a
dutiful
wife
should
,
endeavoured
to
form
my
taste
by
that
of
the
man
I
chose
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
after
all
,
Pamela
,
you
are
not
to
be
a
little
proud
of
my
correspondence
;
and
I
could
not
have
thought
it
ever
would
have
come
to
this
;
but
you
will
observe
,
that
I
am
the
more
free
and
unreserved
,
to
encourage
you
to
write
without
restraint
:
for
already
you
have
made
us
a
family
of
writers
and
readers
;
so
that
Lord
Davers
himself
is
become
enamoured
of
your
letters
,
and
desires
of
all
things
he
may
hear
read
every
one
that
passes
between
us
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
Jackey
,
for
that
matter
,
who
was
the
most
thoughtless
,
whistling
,
sauntering
fellow
you
ever
knew
,
and
whose
delight
in
a
book
ran
no
higher
than
a
song
or
a
catch
,
now
comes
in
with
an
enquiring
face
,
and
vows
he
'll
set
pen
to
paper
,
and
turn
letter
-
writer
himself
;
and
intends
(
if
my
brother
wo
n't
take
it
amiss
,
he
says
)
to
begin
to
you
,
provided
he
could
be
sure
of
an
answer
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
twenty
things
still
to
say
;
for
you
have
unlocked
all
our
bosoms
.
<EOS>
And
yet
I
intended
not
to
write
above
ten
or
a
dozen
lines
when
I
began
;
only
to
tell
you
,
that
I
would
have
you
take
your
own
way
,
in
your
subjects
,
and
in
your
style
.
<EOS>
And
if
you
will
but
give
me
hope
,
that
you
are
in
the
way
I
so
much
wish
to
have
you
in
,
I
will
then
call
myself
your
affectionate
sister
;
but
till
then
,
it
shall
only
barely
be
your
correspondent
,
  
B.
DAVERS
.
<EOS>
You
'll
proceed
with
the
account
of
your
Kentish
affair
,
I
doubt
not
.
    
<EOS>
MY
DEAR
GOOD
LADY
,
  
<EOS>
What
kind
,
what
generous
things
are
you
pleased
to
say
of
your
happy
correspondent
!
<EOS>
And
what
reason
have
I
to
value
myself
on
such
an
advantage
as
is
now
before
me
,
if
I
am
capable
of
improving
it
as
I
ought
,
from
a
correspondence
with
so
noble
and
so
admired
a
lady
!
<EOS>
To
be
praised
by
such
a
genius
,
and
my
honoured
benefactor
's
worthy
sister
,
whose
favour
,
next
to
his
,
it
was
always
my
chief
ambition
to
obtain
,
is
what
would
be
enough
to
fill
with
vanity
a
steadier
and
a
more
equal
mind
than
mine
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
heard
from
my
late
honoured
lady
,
what
a
fine
pen
<EOS>
her
beloved
daughter
was
mistress
of
,
when
she
pleased
to
take
it
up
.
<EOS>
But
I
never
could
have
presumed
,
but
from
your
ladyship
's
own
motion
,
to
hope
to
be
in
any
manner
the
subject
of
it
,
much
less
to
be
called
your
correspondent
.
  
<EOS>
Indeed
,
Madam
,
I
am
very
proud
of
this
honour
,
and
consider
it
as
such
a
heightening
to
my
pleasures
,
as
only
that
could
give
;
and
I
will
set
about
obeying
your
ladyship
without
reserve
.
  
<EOS>
But
,
first
,
permit
me
to
disclaim
any
merit
,
from
my
own
poor
writings
,
to
that
improvement
which
your
goodness
imputes
to
me
.
<EOS>
What
I
have
to
boast
,
of
that
sort
,
is
owing
principally
,
if
it
deserves
commendation
,
to
my
late
excellent
lady
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
hard
to
be
imagined
what
pains
her
ladyship
took
with
her
poor
servant
.
<EOS>
Besides
making
me
keep
a
book
of
her
charities
dispensed
by
me
,
I
always
set
down
,
in
my
way
,
the
cases
of
the
distressed
,
their
griefs
from
misfortunes
,
and
their
joys
of
her
bountiful
relief
;
and
so
I
entered
early
into
the
various
turns
that
affected
worthy
hearts
,
and
was
taught
the
better
to
regulate
my
own
,
especially
by
the
help
of
her
fine
observations
,
when
I
read
what
I
wrote
.
<EOS>
For
many
a
time
has
her
generous
heart
overflowed
with
pleasure
at
my
remarks
,
and
with
praises
;
and
I
was
her
good
girl
,
her
dear
Pamela
,
her
hopeful
maiden
;
and
she
would
sometimes
snatch
my
hand
with
transport
,
and
draw
me
to
her
,
and
vouchsafe
to
kiss
me
;
and
always
was
saying
,
what
she
would
do
for
me
,
if
God
spared
her
,
and
I
continued
to
be
deserving
.
  
<EOS>
O
my
dear
lady
!
<EOS>
you
can
not
think
what
an
encouragement
this
condescending
behaviour
and
goodness
was
to
me
.
<EOS>
Madam
,
you
can
not
think
it
.
  
<EOS>
I
used
to
throw
myself
at
her
feet
,
and
embrace
her
knees
;
and
,
my
eyes
streaming
with
tears
of
joy
,
would
often
cry
,
"
O
continue
to
me
,
my
dearest
lady
,
the
blessing
of
your
favour
,
and
kind
instructions
,
and
it
is
all
your
happy
Pamela
can
wish
for
.
"
  
<EOS>
But
I
will
proceed
to
obey
your
ladyship
,
and
write
with
as
much
freedom
<EOS>
as
I
possibly
can
:
for
you
must
not
expect
,
that
I
can
entirely
divest
myself
of
that
awe
which
will
necessarily
lay
me
under
a
greater
restraint
,
than
if
writing
to
my
parents
,
whose
partiality
for
their
daughter
made
me
,
in
a
manner
,
secure
of
their
good
opinions
.
  
<EOS>
To
shorten
the
work
before
me
,
in
the
account
I
am
to
give
of
the
sweet
fortnight
that
we
passed
in
Kent
,
I
enclose
not
only
the
copy
of
the
letter
your
ladyship
requested
,
but
my
father
's
answer
to
it
.
  
<EOS>
The
letters
I
sent
before
,
and
those
I
now
send
,
will
afford
several
particulars
;
such
as
a
brief
description
of
the
house
and
farm
,
and
your
honoured
brother
's
intentions
of
retiring
thither
now
-
and
-
then
;
of
the
happiness
and
gratitude
of
my
dear
parents
,
and
their
wishes
to
be
able
to
deserve
the
comfort
his
goodness
has
heaped
upon
them
;
and
that
in
stronger
lights
than
I
am
able
to
set
them
;
I
will
only
,
in
a
summary
manner
,
mention
the
rest
;
and
,
particularly
,
the
behaviour
of
my
dear
benefactor
to
me
,
and
my
parents
.
<EOS>
He
seemed
always
to
delight
in
being
particularly
kind
to
them
before
strangers
,
and
before
the
tenants
,
and
before
Mr.
Sorby
,
Mr.
Bennet
,
and
Mr.
Shepherd
,
three
of
the
principal
gentlemen
in
the
neighbourhood
,
who
,
with
their
ladies
,
came
to
visit
us
,
and
whose
visits
we
all
returned
;
for
your
dear
brother
would
not
permit
my
father
and
mother
to
decline
the
invitation
of
those
worthy
families
.
  
<EOS>
Every
day
we
rode
out
,
or
walked
a
little
about
the
grounds
;
and
while
we
were
there
,
he
employed
hands
to
cut
a
vista
through
a
coppice
,
as
they
call
it
,
or
rather
a
little
wood
,
to
a
rising
ground
,
which
,
fronting
an
old
-
fashioned
balcony
,
in
the
middle
of
the
house
,
he
ordered
it
to
be
planted
like
a
grove
,
and
a
pretty
alcove
to
be
erected
on
its
summit
,
of
which
he
has
sent
them
a
draught
,
drawn
by
his
own
hand
.
<EOS>
This
and
a
few
other
alterations
,
mentioned
in
my
letter
to
my
father
,
are
to
be
finished
against
we
go
down
next
.
  
<EOS>
The
dear
gentleman
was
every
hour
pressing
me
,
while
there
,
to
take
one
diversion
or
other
,
frequently
upbraiding
me
,
that
I
seemed
not
to
choose
any
thing
,
urging
me
to
propose
sometimes
what
I
could
wish
he
should
oblige
me
in
,
and
not
always
to
leave
it
to
him
to
choose
for
me
:
saying
,
he
was
half
afraid
that
my
constant
compliance
with
every
thing
he
proposed
,
laid
me
sometimes
under
a
restraint
:
and
he
would
have
me
have
a
will
of
my
own
,
since
it
was
impossible
,
that
it
could
be
such
as
he
should
not
take
a
delight
in
conforming
to
it
.
  
<EOS>
I
will
not
trouble
your
ladyship
with
any
further
particulars
relating
to
this
happy
fortnight
,
which
was
made
up
all
of
white
and
unclouded
days
,
to
the
very
last
;
and
your
ladyship
will
judge
better
than
I
can
describe
,
of
the
parting
between
my
dear
parents
,
and
their
honoured
benefactor
and
me
.
  
<EOS>
We
set
out
,
attended
with
the
good
wishes
of
crowds
of
persons
of
all
degrees
;
for
your
dear
brother
left
behind
him
noble
instances
of
his
bounty
;
it
being
the
first
time
,
as
he
bid
Mr.
Longman
say
,
that
he
had
been
down
among
them
since
that
estate
had
been
in
his
hands
.
  
<EOS>
But
permit
me
to
observe
,
that
I
could
not
forbear
often
,
very
often
,
in
this
happy
period
,
to
thank
God
in
private
,
for
the
blessed
terms
upon
which
I
was
there
,
to
what
I
should
have
been
,
had
I
gracelessly
accepted
of
those
which
formerly
were
tendered
to
me
;
for
your
ladyship
will
remember
,
that
the
Kentish
estate
was
to
be
part
of
the
purchase
of
my
infamy
.
  
<EOS>
We
returned
through
London
,
by
the
like
easy
journeys
,
but
tarried
not
to
see
any
thing
of
that
vast
metropolis
,
any
more
than
we
did
in
going
through
it
before
;
your
beloved
brother
only
stopping
at
his
banker
's
,
and
desiring
him
to
look
out
for
a
handsome
house
,
which
he
proposes
to
take
for
his
winter
residence
.
<EOS>
He
chooses
it
to
be
about
the
new
buildings
called
Hanover
Square
;
and
he
left
Mr.
Longman
there
to
see
one
,
which
his
banker
believed
would
be
fit
for
him
.
  
<EOS>
And
thus
,
my
dear
lady
,
I
have
answered
your
first
commands
,
by
the
help
of
the
letters
which
passed
between
my
dear
parents
and
me
;
and
conclude
this
with
the
assurance
that
I
am
,
with
high
respect
,
your
ladyship
's
most
obliged
and
faithful
servant
,
  
P.B.
    
MY
DEAREST
LADY
,
  
<EOS>
I
now
set
myself
to
obey
your
ladyship
's
second
command
,
which
is
,
to
give
an
account
in
what
manner
<EOS>
your
dear
brother
broke
to
me
the
affair
of
the
unfortunate
Miss
Godfrey
,
with
my
behaviour
upon
it
;
and
this
I
can
not
do
better
,
than
by
transcribing
scribing
the
relation
I
gave
at
that
time
,
in
letters
to
my
dear
parents
,
which
your
ladyship
has
not
seen
,
in
these
very
words
.
  
<EOS>
[
See
Vol

<EOS>

beginning
"
My
dear
Mr.
B.
,
"
down
to
p.

.
]
  
<EOS>
Thus
far
,
my
dear
lady
,
the
relation
I
gave
to
my
parents
,
at
the
time
of
my
being
first
acquainted
with
this
melancholy
affair
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
a
great
pleasure
to
me
,
that
I
can
already
flatter
myself
,
from
the
hints
you
kindly
gave
me
,
that
I
behaved
as
you
wished
I
should
behave
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
Madam
,
I
could
not
help
it
,
for
I
pitied
most
sincerely
the
unhappy
lady
;
and
though
I
could
not
but
rejoice
,
that
I
had
had
the
grace
to
escape
the
dangerous
attempts
of
the
dear
intriguer
,
yet
never
did
the
story
of
any
unfortunate
lady
make
such
an
impression
upon
me
as
hers
did
:
she
loved
him
,
and
believed
,
no
doubt
,
he
loved
her
too
well
to
take
ungenerous
advantages
of
her
soft
passion
for
him
:
and
<EOS>
so
,
by
degrees
,
put
herself
into
his
power
;
and
too
seldom
,
<EOS>
alas
I
have
the
noblest
-
minded
of
the
seducing
sex
the
mercy
or
the
goodness
to
spare
the
poor
creatures
that
do
!
  
<EOS>
Then
'
tis
another
misfortune
of
people
in
love
;
they
always
think
highly
of
the
beloved
object
,
and
lowly
of
themselves
,
such
a
dismal
mortifier
is
love
!
  
<EOS>
I
say
not
this
,
Madam
,
to
excuse
the
poor
lady
's
fall
;
nothing
can
do
that
;
because
virtue
is
,
and
ought
to
be
,
preferable
to
all
considerations
,
and
to
life
itself
.
<EOS>
But
,
methinks
,
I
love
this
dear
lady
so
well
for
the
sake
of
her
edifying
penitence
,
that
I
would
fain
extenuate
her
crime
,
if
I
could
;
and
the
rather
,
as
in
all
probability
,
it
was
a
first
love
on
both
sides
;
and
so
he
could
not
appear
to
her
as
a
practised
deceiver
.
  
<EOS>
Your
ladyship
will
see
,
by
what
I
have
transcribed
,
how
I
behaved
myself
to
the
dear
Miss
Goodwin
;
and
I
am
so
fond
of
the
little
charmer
,
as
well
for
<EOS>
the
sake
of
her
unhappy
mother
,
though
personally
unknown
to
me
,
as
for
the
relation
she
bears
to
the
dear
gentleman
whom
I
am
bound
to
love
and
honour
,
that
I
must
beg
your
ladyship
's
interest
to
procure
her
to
be
given
up
to
my
care
,
when
it
shall
be
thought
proper
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
I
shall
act
by
her
as
tenderly
as
if
I
was
her
own
mother
.
<EOS>
And
glad
I
am
,
that
the
poor
unfaulty
baby
is
so
justly
beloved
by
Mr.
B.
  
<EOS>
But
I
will
here
conclude
this
letter
,
with
assuring
your
ladyship
,
and
I
am
your
obliged
and
humble
servant
,
  
P.B.
    
MY
GOOD
LADY
,
  
<EOS>
I
now
come
to
your
ladyship
's
remarks
on
my
conduct
to
Mrs.
Jewkes
:
which
you
are
pleased
to
think
too
kind
and
forgiving
considering
the
poor
woman
's
baseness
.
  
<EOS>
Your
ladyship
says
,
that
I
ought
not
to
have
borne
her
in
my
sight
,
after
the
impudent
assistance
she
gave
to
his
lewd
attempts
;
much
less
to
have
left
her
in
her
place
,
and
rewarded
her
.
<EOS>
Alas
!
<EOS>
my
dear
lady
,
what
could
I
do
?
<EOS>
a
poor
prisoner
as
I
was
made
,
for
weeks
together
,
in
breach
of
all
the
laws
of
civil
society
;
without
a
soul
who
durst
be
my
friend
;
and
every
day
expecting
to
be
ruined
and
undone
,
by
one
of
the
haughtiest
and
most
determined
spirits
in
the
world
!
 
<EOS>
and
when
it
pleased
God
to
turn
his
heart
,
and
incline
him
to
abandon
his
wicked
attempts
,
and
to
profess
honourable
love
to
me
,
his
poor
servant
,
can
it
be
thought
I
was
to
insist
upon
conditions
with
such
a
gentleman
,
who
had
me
in
his
power
;
and
who
,
if
I
had
provoked
him
,
might
have
resumed
all
his
wicked
purposes
against
me
?
  
<EOS>
Indeed
,
I
was
too
much
overjoyed
,
after
all
my
dangers
past
(
which
were
so
great
,
that
I
could
not
go
to
rest
,
nor
rise
,
but
with
such
apprehensions
,
that
I
wished
for
death
rather
than
life
)
,
to
think
of
refusing
any
terms
that
I
could
yield
to
,
and
keep
my
honour
.
  
<EOS>
And
though
such
noble
ladies
,
as
your
ladyship
and
Lady
Betty
,
who
are
born
to
independency
,
and
are
hereditarily
,
as
I
may
say
,
on
a
foot
with
the
highest
-
descended
gentleman
in
the
land
,
might
have
exerted
a
spirit
,
and
would
have
a
right
to
choose
your
own
servants
,
and
to
distribute
rewards
and
punishments
to
the
deserving
and
undeserving
,
at
your
own
good
pleasure
;
yet
what
had
I
,
a
poor
girl
,
who
owed
even
my
title
to
common
notice
,
to
the
bounty
of
my
late
good
lady
,
and
had
only
a
kind
of
imputed
sightliness
of
person
,
though
enough
to
make
me
the
subject
of
vile
attempts
;
who
,
from
a
situation
of
terror
and
apprehension
,
was
lifted
up
to
an
hope
,
beyond
my
highest
ambition
,
and
was
bid
to
pardon
the
bad
woman
,
as
an
instance
,
that
I
could
forgive
his
own
hard
usage
of
me
;
who
had
experienced
so
often
the
violence
and
impetuosity
of
his
temper
,
which
even
his
beloved
mother
never
ventured
to
oppose
till
it
began
to
subside
,
and
then
,
indeed
,
he
was
all
goodness
and
acknowledgment
;
of
which
I
could
give
your
ladyship
more
than
one
instance
.
  
<EOS>
What
,
I
say
,
had
I
to
do
,
to
take
upon
me
lady
-
airs
,
and
to
resent
?
<EOS>
But
,
my
dear
ladies
(
let
me
,
in
this
instance
,
bespeak
the
attention
of
you
both
)
,
I
should
be
inexcusable
,
if
I
did
not
tell
you
all
the
truth
;
and
that
is
,
that
I
not
only
forgave
the
poor
wretch
,
in
regard
to
his
commands
,
but
from
my
own
inclination
also
.
<EOS>
If
I
am
wrong
in
saying
this
,
I
must
submit
it
to
your
ladyships
;
and
,
as
I
pretend
not
to
perfection
,
am
ready
to
take
the
blame
I
deserve
in
your
ladyships
'
judgments
:
but
indeed
,
were
it
to
be
again
<EOS>
,
I
verily
think
,
I
could
not
help
forgiving
her
.
 
<EOS>
And
were
I
not
able
to
say
this
,
I
should
be
thought
to
have
made
a
mean
court
to
my
master
's
passions
,
and
to
have
done
a
wrong
thing
with
my
eyes
open
:
which
I
humbly
conceive
,
no
one
should
do
.
  
<EOS>
When
full
power
was
given
me
over
this
poor
creature
(
seemingly
at
least
,
though
it
might
possibly
have
been
resumed
,
and
I
might
have
been
re
-
committed
to
hers
,
had
I
given
him
reason
to
think
I
made
an
arrogant
use
of
it
)
<EOS>
,
you
can
not
imagine
what
a
triumph
I
had
in
my
mind
over
the
mortified
guilt
,
which
(
from
the
highest
degree
of
insolence
and
imperiousness
,
that
before
had
hardened
her
masculine
features
)
appeared
in
her
countenance
,
when
she
found
the
tables
likely
to
be
soon
turned
upon
her
.
  
<EOS>
This
change
of
behaviour
,
which
at
first
discovered
itself
in
a
sullen
awe
,
and
afterwards
in
a
kind
of
silent
respect
,
shewed
me
,
what
an
influence
power
had
over
her
:
and
that
when
she
could
treat
her
late
prisoner
,
when
taken
into
favour
,
so
obsequiously
,
it
was
the
less
wonder
<EOS>
the
bad
woman
could
think
it
her
duty
to
obey
commands
so
unjust
,
when
her
obedience
to
them
was
required
from
her
master
.
  
<EOS>
To
be
sure
,
if
a
look
could
have
killed
her
,
after
some
of
her
bad
treatment
,
she
had
been
slain
over
and
over
,
as
I
may
say
:
but
to
me
,
who
was
always
taught
to
distinguish
between
the
person
and
the
action
,
I
could
not
hold
my
resentment
against
the
poor
passive
machine
of
mischief
one
day
together
,
though
her
actions
were
so
odious
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
should
indeed
except
that
time
of
my
grand
trial
when
she
appeared
so
much
a
wretch
to
me
,
that
I
saw
her
not
(
even
after
two
days
that
she
was
kept
from
me
)
without
great
flutter
and
emotion
of
heart
:
<EOS>
and
I
had
represented
to
your
brother
before
<EOS>
,
how
hard
a
condition
it
was
for
me
to
forgive
so
much
unwomanly
wickedness
.
  
<EOS>
But
,
my
dear
ladies
,
when
I
considered
the
latter
in
one
particular
light
,
I
could
the
more
easily
forgive
her
;
and
having
forgiven
her
,
bear
her
in
my
sight
,
and
act
by
her
(
as
a
consequence
of
that
forgiveness
)
as
if
she
had
not
so
horridly
offended
.
<EOS>
Else
how
would
it
have
been
forgiveness
?
<EOS>
especially
as
she
was
ashamed
of
her
crime
,
and
there
was
no
fear
of
her
repeating
it
.
  
<EOS>
Thus
then
I
thought
on
the
occasion
:
"
Poor
wretched
agent
,
for
purposes
little
less
than
infernal
!
<EOS>
I
will
forgive
thee
,
since
thy
master
and
my
master
will
have
it
so
.
<EOS>
And
indeed
thou
art
beneath
the
resentment
even
of
such
a
poor
girl
as
I.
<EOS>
I
will
pity
thee
,
base
and
abject
as
thou
art
.
<EOS>
And
she
who
is
the
object
of
my
pity
is
surely
beneath
my
anger
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Such
were
then
my
thoughts
,
my
proud
thoughts
,
so
far
was
I
from
being
guilty
of
intentional
meanness
in
forgiving
,
at
Mr.
B.
's
interposition
,
the
poor
,
low
,
creeping
,
abject
self
-
mortified
,
and
master
-
mortified
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
.
  
<EOS>
And
do
you
think
,
<EOS>
ladies
,
when
you
revolve
in
your
thoughts
,
who
I
was
,
and
what
I
was
,
and
what
I
had
been
designed
for
;
when
you
revolve
the
amazing
turn
in
my
favour
,
and
the
prospects
before
me
(
so
much
above
my
hopes
,
that
I
left
them
entirely
to
Providence
to
direct
for
me
,
as
it
pleased
,
without
daring
to
look
forward
to
what
those
prospects
seemed
naturally
to
tend
)
;
when
I
could
see
my
haughty
persecutor
become
my
repentant
protector
;
the
lofty
spirit
that
used
to
make
me
tremble
,
and
to
which
I
never
could
look
up
without
awe
,
except
in
those
animating
cases
,
where
his
guilty
attempts
,
and
the
concern
I
had
to
preserve
my
innocence
,
gave
a
courage
more
than
natural
to
my
otherwise
dastardly
heart
:
when
this
impetuous
spirit
could
stoop
to
request
one
whom
he
had
sunk
beneath
even
her
usual
low
character
of
his
servant
,
who
was
his
prisoner
,
under
sentence
of
a
ruin
worse
than
death
,
as
he
had
intended
it
,
and
had
seized
her
for
that
very
purpose
,
could
stoop
to
acknowledge
the
vileness
of
that
purpose
;
could
say
,
at
one
time
,
that
my
forgiveness
of
Mrs.
Jewkes
should
stand
me
in
greater
stead
than
I
was
aware
of
:
could
tell
her
,
before
me
,
that
she
must
for
the
future
<EOS>
shew
me
<EOS>
all
the
respect
due
to
one
he
must
love
;
at
another
,
acknowledged
before
her
,
that
he
had
been
stark
naught
,
and
that
I
was
very
forgiving
;
again
,
to
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
putting
himself
on
a
level
with
her
,
as
to
guilt
,
"
We
are
both
in
generous
hands
:
and
,
indeed
,
if
Pamela
did
not
pardon
you
,
I
should
think
she
but
half
forgave
me
,
because
you
acted
by
my
instructions
:
"
<EOS>
another
time
to
the
same
,
"
We
have
been
both
sinners
,
and
must
be
both
included
in
one
act
of
grace
:
"
 
when
I
was
thus
lifted
up
to
the
state
of
a
sovereign
forgiver
,
and
my
lordly
master
became
a
petitioner
for
himself
,
and
the
guilty
creature
,
whom
he
put
under
my
feet
;
what
a
triumph
was
here
for
the
poor
Pamela
?
<EOS>
and
could
I
have
been
guilty
of
<EOS>
so
mean
a
pride
,
as
to
trample
upon
the
poor
abject
creature
,
when
I
found
her
thus
lowly
,
thus
mortified
,
and
wholly
in
my
power
?
  
<EOS>
Then
,
my
dear
ladies
,
while
I
was
enjoying
the
soul
-
charming
fruits
of
that
innocence
which
the
Divine
Grace
had
enabled
me
to
preserve
,
in
spite
of
so
many
plots
and
contrivances
on
my
master
's
side
,
and
such
wicked
instigations
and
assistances
on
hers
,
and
all
my
prospects
were
improving
upon
me
beyond
my
wishes
;
when
all
was
unclouded
sunshine
,
and
I
possessed
my
mind
in
peace
,
and
had
only
to
be
thankful
to
Providence
,
which
had
been
so
gracious
to
my
unworthiness
;
when
I
saw
my
persecutor
become
my
protector
,
my
active
enemy
no
longer
my
enemy
,
but
creeping
with
slow
,
doubtful
feet
,
and
speaking
to
me
with
awful
hesitating
doubt
of
my
acceptance
;
a
stamp
of
an
insolent
foot
now
turned
into
curtseying
half
-
bent
knees
;
threatening
hands
into
supplicating
folds
;
and
the
eye
unpitying
to
innocence
,
running
over
with
the
sense
of
her
own
guilt
;
a
faltering
accent
on
her
late
menacing
tongue
,
and
uplifted
handkerchief
,
"
<EOS>
I
see
she
will
be
my
lady
:
<EOS>
and
then
I
know
how
it
will
go
with
me
!
"
 
<EOS>
Was
not
this
,
my
ladies
,
a
triumph
of
triumphs
to
the
late
miserable
,
now
exalted
,
Pamela
!
 
<EOS>
could
I
do
less
than
pardon
her
?
<EOS>
And
having
declared
that
I
did
so
,
was
I
not
to
shew
the
sincerity
of
my
declaration
?
  
<EOS>
Would
it
not
have
shewn
my
master
,
that
the
low
-
born
Pamela
was
incapable
of
a
generous
action
,
had
she
refused
the
only
request
her
humble
condition
had
given
her
the
opportunity
of
granting
,
at
that
time
,
with
innocence
?
<EOS>
Would
he
not
have
thought
the
humble
cottager
as
capable
of
insolence
,
and
vengeance
too
,
in
her
turn
,
as
the
better
born
?
<EOS>
and
that
she
wanted
<EOS>
but
the
power
,
to
shew
the
like
unrelenting
temper
,
by
which
she
had
so
grievously
suffered
?
<EOS>
And
might
not
this
have
given
him
room
to
think
me
(
and
to
have
resumed
and
prosecuted
his
purposes
accordingly
)
<EOS>
fitter
for
an
arrogant
kept
mistress
,
than
an
humble
and
obliged
wife
!
  
<EOS>
"
I
see
"
(
might
he
not
have
said
?
)
,
"
the
girl
has
strong
passions
and
resentments
;
and
she
that
has
,
will
be
sometimes
governed
by
them
.
<EOS>
I
will
improve
upon
the
hint
she
herself
has
now
given
me
,
by
her
inexorable
temper
:
I
will
gratify
her
revenge
,
till
I
turn
it
upon
herself
:
I
will
indulge
her
pride
,
till
I
make
it
administer
to
her
fall
;
for
a
wife
I
can
not
think
of
in
the
low
-
born
cottager
,
especially
when
she
has
lurking
in
her
all
the
pride
and
arrogance
"
(
you
know
,
my
ladies
,
his
haughty
way
of
speaking
of
our
sex
)
"
of
the
better
descended
.
<EOS>
And
by
a
little
perseverance
,
and
watching
her
unguarded
hours
,
and
applying
temptations
to
her
passions
,
I
shall
first
discover
them
,
and
then
make
my
advantage
of
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Might
not
this
have
been
the
language
,
and
this
the
resolution
,
of
such
a
dear
wicked
intriguer
?
 
<EOS>
For
,
my
lady
,
you
can
hardly
conceive
the
struggles
he
apparently
had
to
bring
down
his
high
spirit
to
so
humble
a
level
.
<EOS>
And
though
,
I
hope
,
all
would
have
been
,
even
in
this
worst
case
,
ineffectual
,
through
Divine
Grace
,
yet
<EOS>
how
do
I
know
what
lurking
vileness
might
have
appeared
by
degrees
in
this
frail
heart
,
to
encourage
his
designs
,
and
to
augment
my
trials
and
my
dangers
?
<EOS>
And
perhaps
downright
violence
might
have
been
used
,
if
he
could
not
,
on
one
hand
,
have
subdued
his
passions
,
nor
,
on
the
other
,
have
overcome
his
pride
 
a
pride
,
that
every
one
,
reflecting
upon
the
disparity
of
birth
and
condition
between
us
,
would
have
dignified
with
the
name
of
decency
;
a
pride
that
was
become
such
an
essential
part
of
the
dear
gentleman
's
character
,
in
this
instance
of
a
wife
,
that
although
he
knew
he
could
not
keep
it
up
,
if
he
made
me
happy
,
yet
it
was
no
small
motive
of
his
choosing
me
,
in
one
respect
,
because
he
expected
from
me
more
humility
,
more
submission
,
than
he
thought
would
be
paid
him
by
a
lady
equally
born
and
educated
;
and
of
this
I
will
send
you
an
instance
,
in
a
transcription
from
that
part
of
my
journal
<EOS>
you
have
not
seen
,
of
his
lessons
to
me
,
on
my
incurring
his
displeasure
by
interposing
between
yourself
and
him
in
your
misunderstanding
at
the
Hall
:
for
,
Madam
,
I
intend
to
send
,
at
times
,
any
thing
I
think
worthy
of
your
ladyship
's
attention
,
out
of
those
papers
<EOS>
you
were
so
kind
as
to
excuse
me
from
sending
you
in
a
lump
,
and
many
of
which
must
needs
have
appeared
very
impertinent
to
such
judges
.
  
<EOS>
Thus
(
could
your
ladyship
have
thought
it
?
)
<EOS>
have
I
ventured
upon
a
strange
paradox
,
that
even
this
strongest
instance
of
his
debasing
himself
,
is
not
the
weakest
of
his
pride
:
and
he
ventured
once
at
Sir
Simon
Darnford
's
to
say
,
in
your
hearing
,
as
you
may
remember
,
that
,
in
his
conscience
,
he
thought
he
should
hardly
have
made
a
tolerable
husband
to
any
body
but
Pamela
:
and
why
?
<EOS>
For
the
reasons
you
will
see
in
the
inclosed
papers
,
which
give
an
account
of
the
noblest
and
earliest
curtain
-
lecture
that
ever
girl
had
:
one
of
which
is
,
that
he
expects
to
be
borne
with
(
complied
with
,
he
meant
)
even
when
in
the
wrong
:
another
,
that
a
wife
should
never
so
much
as
expostulate
with
him
,
though
he
was
in
the
wrong
,
till
,
by
complying
with
all
he
insisted
upon
,
she
should
have
shewn
him
,
she
designed
rather
to
convince
him
,
for
his
own
sake
,
than
for
contradiction
's
sake
;
and
then
,
another
time
,
perhaps
he
might
take
better
resolutions
.
  
<EOS>
I
hope
,
from
what
I
have
said
,
it
will
appear
to
your
lady
-
ship
,
and
to
Lady
Betty
too
,
that
I
am
justified
,
or
at
least
excused
,
in
pardoning
Mrs.
Jewkes
.
  
<EOS>
But
your
dear
brother
has
just
sent
me
word
<EOS>
,
that
supper
waits
for
me
:
and
the
post
being
ready
to
go
off
,
I
defer
till
the
next
opportunity
which
I
have
to
say
as
to
these
good
effects
:
and
am
,
in
the
mean
time
,
your
ladyship
's
most
obliged
and
faithful
servant
,
  
P.B.
    
MY
DEAR
LADY
,
  
I
will
now
acquaint
you
with
the
good
effects
my
behaviour
to
Mrs.
Jewkes
has
had
upon
her
,
as
a
farther
justification
of
my
conduct
towards
the
poor
woman
.
  
<EOS>
That
she
began
to
be
affected
as
I
wished
,
appeared
to
me
before
I
left
the
Hall
,
not
only
in
the
conversations
I
had
with
her
after
my
happiness
was
completed
;
but
in
her
general
demeanour
also
to
the
servants
,
to
the
neighbours
,
and
in
her
devout
behaviour
at
church
:
and
this
still
further
appears
by
a
letter
I
have
received
from
Miss
Darnford
.
<EOS>
I
dare
say
your
ladyship
will
be
pleased
with
the
perusal
of
the
whole
letter
,
although
a
part
of
it
would
answer
my
present
design
;
and
in
confidence
,
that
you
will
excuse
,
for
the
sake
of
its
other
beauties
,
the
high
and
undeserved
praises
which
she
so
lavishly
bestows
upon
me
,
I
will
transcribe
it
all
.
  
<EOS>
From
Miss
Darnford
to
Mrs.
B.
  
"
MY
DEAR
NEIGHBOUR
THAT
WAS
,
  
"
I
must
depend
upon
your
known
goodness
to
excuse
me
for
not
writing
before
now
,
in
answer
to
your
letter
of
compliment
to
us
,
for
the
civilities
and
favours
,
as
you
call
them
,
which
you
received
from
us
in
Lincolnshire
,
where
we
were
infinitely
more
obliged
to
you
than
you
to
us
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
truth
is
,
my
papa
has
been
much
disordered
with
a
kind
of
rambling
rheumatism
,
to
which
the
physicians
,
learnedly
speaking
,
give
the
name
of
arthritici
vaga
,
or
the
flying
gout
;
and
when
he
ails
ever
so
little
(
it
signifies
nothing
concealing
his
infirmities
,
where
they
are
so
well
known
,
and
when
he
cares
not
who
knows
them
)
,
he
is
so
peevish
,
and
wants
so
much
attendance
,
that
my
mamma
,
and
her
two
girls
(
one
of
which
is
as
waspish
as
her
papa
;
you
may
be
sure
I
do
n't
mean
myself
)
<EOS>
have
much
ado
to
make
his
worship
keep
the
peace
;
and
I
being
his
favourite
,
when
he
is
indisposed
,
having
most
patience
,
if
I
may
give
myself
a
good
word
<EOS>
,
he
calls
upon
me
continually
,
to
read
to
him
when
he
is
grave
,
which
is
not
often
,
and
to
tell
him
stories
,
and
sing
to
him
when
he
is
merry
;
and
so
I
have
been
employed
as
a
principal
person
about
him
,
till
I
have
frequently
become
sad
to
make
him
cheerful
,
and
happy
when
I
could
do
it
at
any
rate
.
<EOS>
For
once
,
in
a
pet
,
he
flung
a
book
at
my
head
,
because
I
had
not
attended
him
for
two
hours
,
and
he
could
not
bear
to
be
slighted
by
little
bastards
,
that
was
his
word
,
that
were
fathered
upon
him
for
his
vexation
!
<EOS>
O
these
men
!
<EOS>
Fathers
or
husbands
,
much
alike
!
<EOS>
the
one
tyrannical
,
the
other
insolent
:
so
that
,
between
one
and
t'other
,
a
poor
girl
has
nothing
for
it
,
but
a
few
weeks
'
courtship
,
and
perhaps
a
first
month
's
bridalry
,
if
that
:
and
then
she
is
as
much
a
slave
to
her
husband
,
as
she
was
a
vassal
to
her
father
 
<EOS>
I
mean
if
the
father
be
a
Sir
Simon
Darnford
,
and
the
spouse

I
will
be

grave

occasion
calls
for
it

yet
such
as
will
give
you
real
pleasure

<EOS>
It
is
the
very
great
change
that
your
example
has
had
upon
your
housekeeper

<EOS>
"
You
desired
her
to
keep
up
as
much
regularity
as
she
could
among
the
servants
there
;
and
she
is
next
to
exemplary
in
it
,
so
that
she
has
every
one
's
good
word

<EOS>
She
speaks
of
her
lady
not
only
with
respect
,

reverence
;
and
calls
it
a
blessed
day
for
all
the
family

particularly
for
herself

that
you
came
into
Lincolnshire

<EOS>
She
reads
prayers
,

makes
one
of
the
servants
read
them
,
every
Sunday
night
;
and
never
misses
being
at
church

morning

afternoon

is
preparing
herself
,
by
Mr.
Peters
's
advice
and
direction
,
for
receiving
the
sacrament
;
which
she
earnestly
longs
to
receive

says
it
will
be
the
seal

her
reformation

Mr.
Peters
gives
us
this
account

says
she
is
full
of
contrition
for
her
past
mis

is
often
asking
him

if
such

It
seems
she
has
written
a
letter
to
you
,
which
passed
Mr.
Peters
's
revisal
,
before
she
had
the
courage
to
send
it
;
and
prides
herself
that
you
have
favoured
her
with
an
answer
to
it

which
,
she
says
,
when
she
is
dead
,
will
be
found
in
a
cover
of
black
silk
next
her
heart

for
any
thing
from
your
hand

she
is
sure
,
will
contribute
to
make
her
keep
her
good
purposes

and
for
that
reason
she
places
it
there
;
and
when
she
has
had
any
bad
thoughts
,
or
is
guilty
of
any
faulty
word
,
or
passionate
expression
,
she
recollects
her
lady

letter

recovers
her

a
calm

puts
her
again
into
a
better
frame

As
she
has
written
to
you

possible
I
might
have
spared
you

reading
this
account

her
;
but
yet
you
will
not
be
displeased
,
that
so
free
a
liver

have
some
testimonial

the

no

add
here
a

your

"
HONOURED
MADAM
,
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
long
labouring
under
two
difficulties
;
the
desire
I
had
to
write
to
you
,
and
the
fear
of
being
thought
presumptuous
if
I
did
.
<EOS>
But
I
will
depend
on
your
goodness
,
so
often
tried
;
and
put
pen
to
paper
,
in
that
very
closet
,
and
on
that
desk
,
which
once
were
so
much
used
by
yourself
,
when
I
was
acting
a
part
that
now
cuts
me
to
the
heart
to
think
of
.
<EOS>
But
you
forgave
me
.
<EOS>
Madam
,
and
shewed
me
you
had
too
much
goodness
to
revoke
your
forgiveness
;
and
could
I
have
silenced
the
reproaches
of
my
heart
,
I
should
have
had
no
cause
to
think
I
had
offended
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
,
Oh
I
Madam
,
how
has
your
goodness
to
me
,
which
once
filled
me
with
so
much
gladness
,
now
,
on
reflection
,
made
me
sorrowful
,
and
at
times
,
miserable
.
 
<EOS>
To
think
I
should
act
so
barbarously
as
I
did
,
by
so
much
sweetness
,
and
so
much
forgiveness
.
<EOS>
Every
place
that
I
remember
to
have
used
you
hardly
in
,
how
does
it
now
fill
me
with
sadness
,
and
makes
me
often
smite
my
breast
,
and
sit
down
with
tears
and
groans
,
bemoaning
my
vile
actions
,
and
my
hard
heart
!
 
<EOS>
How
many
places
are
there
in
this
melancholy
fine
house
,
that
call
one
thing
or
other
to
my
remembrance
,
that
give
me
remorse
!
<EOS>
But
the
pond
,
and
the
woodhouse
,
whence
I
dragged
you
so
mercilously
,
after
I
had
driven
you
to
despair
almost
,
what
thoughts
do
they
bring
to
my
remembrance
!
<EOS>
Then
my
wicked
instigations
.
 
<EOS>
What
an
odious
wretch
was
I
!
  
<EOS>
"
Had
his
honour
been
as
abandoned
as
myself
,
what
virtue
had
been
destroyed
between
his
orders
and
my
too
rigorous
execution
of
them
;
nay
,
stretching
them
to
shew
my
wicked
zeal
,
to
serve
a
master
,
<EOS>
whom
,
though
I
honoured
,
I
should
not
(
as
you
more
than
once
hinted
to
me
,
but
with
no
effect
at
all
,
so
resolutely
wicked
was
my
heart
)
have
so
well
obeyed
in
his
unlawful
commands
!
  
<EOS>
"
His
honour
has
made
you
amends
,
has
done
justice
to
your
merits
,
and
so
atoned
for
his
fault
.
<EOS>
But
as
for
me
,
it
is
out
of
my
power
ever
to
make
reparation
.
 
<EOS>
All
that
is
left
me
,
is
,
to
let
your
ladyship
see
,
that
your
pious
example
has
made
such
an
impression
upon
me
,
that
I
am
miserable
now
in
the
reflection
upon
my
past
guilt
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
forgiven
me
,
and
GOD
will
,
I
hope
;
for
the
creature
can
not
be
more
merciful
than
the
Creator
;
that
is
all
my
hope
!
 
<EOS>
Yet
,
sometimes
,
I
dread
that
I
am
forgiven
here
,
at
least
not
punished
,
in
order
to
be
punished
the
more
hereafter
!
 
<EOS>
What
then
will
become
of
the
unhappy
wretch
,
that
has
thus
lived
in
a
state
of
sin
,
and
so
qualified
herself
by
a
course
of
wickedness
,
as
to
be
thought
a
proper
instrument
for
the
worst
of
purposes
!
  
<EOS>
"
Pray
your
ladyship
,
let
not
my
honoured
master
see
this
letter
.
<EOS>
He
will
think
I
have
the
boldness
to
reflect
upon
him
:
when
,
God
knows
my
heart
,
I
only
write
to
condemn
myself
,
and
my
unwomanly
actions
,
as
you
were
pleased
often
most
justly
to
call
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
might
go
on
thus
for
ever
accusing
myself
,
not
considering
whom
I
am
writing
to
,
and
whose
precious
time
I
am
taking
up
.
<EOS>
But
what
I
chiefly
write
for
is
,
to
beg
your
ladyship
's
prayers
for
me
.
<EOS>
For
,
oh
!
<EOS>
Madam
,
I
fear
I
shall
else
be
ever
miserable
!
<EOS>
We
every
week
hear
of
the
good
you
do
,
and
the
charity
you
extend
to
the
bodies
of
the
miserable
.
<EOS>
Extend
,
I
beseech
you
,
good
Madam
,
to
the
unhappy
Jewkes
,
the
mercy
of
your
prayers
,
and
tell
me
if
you
think
I
have
not
sinned
beyond
hope
of
pardon
;
for
there
is
a
woe
denounced
against
the
presumptuous
sinner
.
  
<EOS>
"
Your
ladyship
assured
me
,
at
your
departure
,
on
the
confession
of
my
remorse
for
my
misdoings
,
and
my
promise
of
amendment
,
that
you
would
take
it
for
proof
of
my
being
in
earnest
,
if
I
would
endeavour
to
keep
up
a
regularity
among
the
servants
here
;
if
I
would
subdue
them
with
kindness
,
as
I
had
owned
myself
subdued
;
and
if
I
would
endeavour
to
make
every
one
think
,
that
the
best
security
they
could
give
of
doing
their
duty
to
their
master
in
his
absence
,
was
by
doing
it
to
God
Almighty
,
from
whose
all
-
seeing
eye
nothing
can
be
hid
.
<EOS>
This
,
I
remember
,
your
ladyship
told
me
,
was
the
best
test
of
fidelity
and
duty
,
that
any
servants
could
shew
;
since
it
was
impossible
,
without
religion
,
but
that
worldly
convenience
,
or
self
-
interest
,
must
be
the
main
tie
;
and
so
the
worst
actions
might
succeed
,
if
servants
thought
they
should
find
their
sordid
advantage
in
sacrificing
their
duty
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
well
am
I
convinced
of
this
truth
,
that
I
hope
I
have
begun
the
example
to
good
effect
:
and
as
no
one
in
the
family
was
so
wicked
as
I
,
it
was
therefore
less
difficult
to
reform
them
;
and
you
will
have
the
pleasure
to
know
,
that
you
have
now
servants
here
,
whom
you
need
not
be
ashamed
to
call
yours
.
  
<EOS>
"
'
Tis
true
,
I
found
it
a
little
difficult
at
first
to
keep
them
within
sight
of
their
duty
,
after
your
ladyship
departed
:
but
when
they
saw
I
was
in
earnest
,
and
used
them
courteously
,
as
you
advised
,
and
as
your
usage
of
me
convinced
me
was
the
rightest
usage
;
when
they
were
told
I
had
your
commands
to
acquaint
you
how
they
conformed
to
your
injunctions
;
the
task
became
easy
:
and
I
hope
we
shall
all
be
still
more
and
more
worthy
of
the
favour
of
so
good
a
lady
and
so
bountiful
a
master
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
dare
not
presume
upon
the
honour
of
a
line
to
your
unworthy
servant
.
<EOS>
Yet
it
would
pride
me
much
,
if
I
could
have
it
.
<EOS>
But
I
shall
ever
pray
for
your
ladyship
's
and
his
honour
's
felicity
,
as
becomes
your
undeserving
servant

K.
JEWKES

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
have
already
,
with
these
transcribed
letters
of
Miss
Darnford
and
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
written
a
great
deal
:
but
nevertheless
,
as
there
yet
remains
one
passage
in
your
ladyship
's
letter
,
relating
to
Mrs.
Jewkes
<EOS>
,
that
seems
to
require
an
answer
,
I
will
take
notice
of
it
,
if
I
shall
not
quite
tire
your
patience
.
  
<EOS>
That
passage
is
this
;
Lady
Betty
rightly
observes
,
says
your
ladyship
,
that
he
knew
what
a
vile
woman
<EOS>
she
[
Mrs.
Jewkes
]
was
,
when
he
put
you
into
her
power
;
and
no
doubt
,
employed
her
,
because
he
was
sure
she
would
answer
all
his
purposes
:
and
therefore
she
should
have
had
very
little
opinion
of
the
sincerity
of
his
reformation
,
while
he
was
so
solicitous
in
keeping
her
there
.
  
<EOS>
She
would
,
she
says
,
had
she
been
in
your
case
,
have
had
one
struggle
for
her
dismission
,
let
it
have
been
taken
as
it
would
;
and
he
that
was
so
well
pleased
with
your
virtue
,
must
have
thought
this
a
natural
consequence
of
it
,
if
in
earnest
to
become
virtuous
himself
.
  
<EOS>
But
,
alas
!
<EOS>
Madam
,
he
was
not
so
well
pleased
with
my
virtue
for
virtue
's
sake
,
as
Lady
Betty
thinks
he
was
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
have
been
glad
,
even
then
,
to
have
found
me
less
resolved
on
that
score
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
so
much
as
pretend
to
any
disposition
to
virtue
.
<EOS>
No
,
not
he
!
  
<EOS>
He
had
entertained
,
as
it
proved
,
a
strong
passion
for
me
,
which
had
been
heightened
by
my
resisting
it
.
<EOS>
His
pride
,
and
his
advantages
both
of
person
and
fortune
,
would
not
let
him
brook
control
;
and
when
he
could
not
have
me
upon
his
own
terms
,
God
turned
his
evil
purposes
to
good
ones
;
and
he
resolved
to
submit
to
mine
,
or
rather
to
such
as
he
found
I
would
not
yield
to
him
without
.
  
<EOS>
But
Lady
Betty
thinks
,
I
was
to
blame
to
put
Mrs.
Jewkes
upon
a
foot
,
<EOS>
in
the
present
I
made
on
my
nuptials
,
with
Mrs.
Jervis
.
<EOS>
But
I
rather
put
Mrs.
Jervis
on
a
foot
with
Mrs.
Jewkes
;
for
the
dear
gentleman
had
named
the
sum
for
me
to
give
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
and
I
would
not
give
Mrs.
Jervis
less
,
because
I
loved
her
better
;
nor
more
could
I
give
her
,
on
that
occasion
,
without
making
such
a
difference
between
two
persons
equal
in
station
,
on
a
solemnity
too
where
one
was
present
and
assisting
,
the
other
<EOS>
not
,
as
would
have
shewn
such
a
partiality
,
as
might
have
induced
their
master
to
conclude
,
I
was
not
so
sincere
in
my
forgiveness
,
as
he
hoped
from
me
,
and
as
I
really
was
.
  
<EOS>
But
a
stronger
reason
still
was
behind
;
that
I
could
,
much
more
agreeably
,
both
to
Mrs.
Jervis
and
myself
,
shew
my
love
and
gratitude
to
the
dear
good
woman
:
and
this
I
have
taken
care
to
do
,
in
the
manner
I
will
submit
to
your
ladyship
;
at
the
tribunal
of
whose
judgment
I
am
willing
all
my
actions
,
respecting
your
dear
brother
,
shall
be
tried
.
<EOS>
And
I
hope
you
will
not
have
reason
to
think
me
a
too
profuse
or
lavish
creature
;
yet
,
if
you
have
,
pray
,
my
dear
lady
,
do
n't
spare
me
;
for
if
you
shall
judge
me
profuse
in
one
article
,
I
will
endeavour
to
save
it
in
another
.
  
<EOS>
But
I
will
make
what
I
have
to
say
on
this
head
the
subject
of
a
letter
by
itself
:
and
am
,
mean
time
,
your
ladyship
's
most
obliged
and
obedient
servant
,
  
P.B.
    
MY
DEAR
LADY
,
  
<EOS>
It
is
needful
,
in
order
to
let
you
more
intelligibly
into
the
subject
where
I
left
off
in
my
last
,
for
your
ladyship
to
know
that
your
generous
brother
has
made
me
his
almoner
,
as
I
was
my
late
dear
lady
's
;
and
ordered
Mr.
Longman
to
pay
me
fifty
pounds
quarterly
,
for
purposes
of
which
he
requires
no
account
,
though
I
have
one
always
ready
to
produce
.
  
<EOS>
Now
,
Madam
,
as
I
knew
Mrs.
Jervis
was
far
from
being
easy
in
her
circumstances
,
thinking
herself
obliged
to
pay
old
debts
for
two
extravagant
children
,
who
are
both
dead
,
and
maintaining
in
schooling
and
clothes
three
of
their
children
,
which
always
keeps
her
bare
,
I
said
to
her
one
day
,
as
she
and
I
sat
together
,
at
our
needles
(

we
are
always
running
over
old
stories
,
when
alone
)
 
<EOS>
"
My
good
Mrs.
Jervis
,
will
you
allow
me
to
ask
you
after
your
own
private
affairs
,
and
if
you
are
tolerably
,
easy
in
them
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
very
good
,
Madam
,
"
said
she
,
"
to
concern
yourself
about
my
poor
matters
,
so
much
as
your
thoughts
are
employed
,
and
every
moment
of
your
time
is
taken
up
,
from
the
hour
you
rise
,
to
the
time
of
your
rest
.
<EOS>
But
I
can
with
great
pleasure
attribute
it
to
your
bounty
,
and
that
of
my
honoured
master
,
that
I
am
easier
and
easier
every
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
But
tell
me
,
my
dear
Mrs.
Jervis
,
"
said
I
,
"
how
your
matters
particularly
stand
.
<EOS>
I
love
to
mingle
concerns
with
my
friends
,
and
as
I
hide
nothing
from
you
,
I
hope
you
'll
treat
me
with
equal
freedom
;
for
I
always
loved
you
,
and
always
will
;
and
nothing
but
death
shall
divide
our
friendship
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
had
tears
of
gratitude
in
her
eyes
,
and
taking
off
her
spectacles
,
"
I
can
not
bear
,
"
she
said
,
"
so
much
goodness
!
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
my
lady
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
<EOS>
my
Pamela
,
say
,
"
replied
I.
"
<EOS>
How
often
must
I
chide
you
for
calling
me
any
thing
but
your
Pamela
,
when
we
are
alone
together
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
heart
,
"
said
she
,
"
will
burst
with
your
goodness
!
<EOS>
I
can
not
bear
it
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
must
bear
it
,
and
bear
still
greater
exercises
to
your
grateful
heart
,
I
can
tell
you
that
.
<EOS>
A
pretty
thing
,
truly
!
<EOS>
Here
I
,
a
poor
helpless
girl
,
raised
from
poverty
and
distress
by
the
generosity
of
the
best
of
men
,
only
because
I
was
young
and
sightly
,
shall
put
on
lady
-
airs
to
a
gentlewoman
born
,
the
wisdom
of
whose
years
,
her
faithful
services
,
and
good
management
,
make
her
a
much
greater
merit
in
this
family
,
than
I
can
pretend
to
have
!
<EOS>
And
shall
I
return
,
in
the
day
of
my
power
,
insult
and
haughtiness
for
the
kindness
and
benevolence
I
received
from
her
in
that
of
my
indigence
!
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
I
wo
n't
forgive
you
,
my
dear
Mrs.
Jervis
,
if
I
think
you
capable
of
looking
upon
me
in
any
other
light
than
as
your
daughter
;
for
you
have
been
a
mother
to
me
,
when
the
absence
of
my
own
could
not
afford
me
the
comfort
and
good
counsel
<EOS>
I
received
every
day
from
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Then
moving
my
chair
nearer
,
and
taking
her
hand
,
and
wiping
,
with
my
handkerchief
in
my
other
,
her
reverend
cheek
,
"
Come
,
my
dear
second
mother
,
"
said
I
,
"
call
me
your
daughter
,
your
Pamela
:
I
have
passed
many
sweet
hours
with
you
under
that
name
;
and
as
I
have
but
too
seldom
such
an
opportunity
as
this
,
open
to
me
your
worthy
heart
,
and
let
me
know
,
if
I
can
not
make
my
second
mother
as
easy
and
happy
as
our
dear
master
has
made
my
first
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
hung
her
head
,
and
I
waited
till
the
discharge
of
her
tears
gave
time
for
utterance
to
her
words
;
provoking
only
her
speech
,
by
saying
,
"
You
used
to
have
three
grand
-
children
to
provide
for
in
clothes
and
schooling
.
<EOS>
They
are
all
living
,
I
hope
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Madam
,
they
are
living
:
and
your
last
bounty
(
twenty
guineas
was
a
great
sum
,
and
all
at
once
!
)
made
me
very
easy
and
very
happy
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
easy
and
how
happy
,
Mrs.
Jervis
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
my
dear
lady
,
I
paid
five
to
one
old
creditor
of
my
unhappy
sons
;
five
to
a
second
;
and
two
and
a
half
to
two
others
,
in
proportion
to
their
respective
demands
;
and
with
the
other
five
I
paid
off
all
arrears
of
the
poor
children
's
schooling
and
maintenance
;
and
all
are
satisfied
and
easy
,
and
declare
they
will
never
do
harsh
things
by
me
,
if
they
are
paid
no
more
.
"
  
"
But
tell
me
,
Mrs.
Jervis
,
the
whole
you
owe
in
the
world
;
and
you
and
I
will
contrive
,
with
justice
to
our
best
friend
,
to
do
all
we
can
to
make
you
quite
easy
;
for
,
at
your
time
of
life
,
I
can
not
bear
that
you
shall
have
any
thing
to
disturb
you
,
which
I
can
remove
,
and
so
,
my
dear
Mrs.
Jervis
,
let
me
know
all
.
<EOS>
I
know
your
debts
(
dear
,
just
,
good
woman
,
as
you
are
!
)
<EOS>
like
David
's
sins
,
are
ever
before
you
:
so
come
,
"
putting
my
hand
in
her
pocket
,
"
let
me
be
a
friendly
pick
-
pocket
;
let
me
take
out
your
memorandum
-
book
,
and
we
will
see
how
all
matters
stand
,
and
what
can
be
done
.
<EOS>
Come
,
I
see
you
are
too
much
moved
;
your
worthy
heart
is
too
much
affected
"
(
pulling
out
her
book
,
which
she
always
had
about
her
)
;
"
I
will
go
to
my
closet
,
and
return
presently
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
So
I
left
her
,
to
recover
her
spirits
,
and
retired
with
the
good
woman
's
book
to
my
closet
.
  
<EOS>
Your
dear
brother
stepping
into
the
parlour
just
after
I
had
gone
out
,
"
Where
's
your
lady
,
Mrs.
Jervis
?
"
said
he
.
<EOS>
And
being
told
,
came
up
to
me
:
 
<EOS>
"
What
ails
the
good
woman
below
,
my
dear
?
"
said
he
:
"
I
hope
you
and
she
have
had
no
words
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
No
,
indeed
,
Sir
,
"
answered
I.
"
<EOS>
If
we
had
,
I
am
sure
it
would
have
been
my
fault
:
but
I
have
picked
her
pocket
of
her
memorandum
-
book
,
in
order
to
look
into
her
private
affairs
,
to
see
if
I
can
not
,
with
justice
to
our
common
benefactor
,
make
her
as
easy
as
you
.
<EOS>
Sir
,
have
made
my
other
dear
parents
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
blessing
,
"
said
he
,
"
upon
my
charmer
's
benevolent
heart
!
 
<EOS>
I
will
leave
every
thing
to
your
discretion
,
my
dear
.
 
<EOS>
Do
all
the
good
you
prudently
can
to
your
Mrs.
Jervis
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
clasped
my
bold
arms
about
him
,
the
starting
tear
testifying
my
gratitude
.
 
<EOS>
"
Dearest
Sir
,
"
said
I
,
"
you
affect
me
as
much
as
I
did
Mrs.
Jervis
;
and
if
any
one
<EOS>
but
you
had
a
right
to
ask
,
what
ails
your
Pamela
?
<EOS>
as
you
do
,
what
ails
Mrs.
Jervis
?
<EOS>
I
must
say
,
I
am
hourly
so
much
oppressed
by
your
goodness
,
that
there
is
hardly
any
bearing
one
's
own
joy
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
saluted
me
,
and
said
,
I
was
a
dear
obliging
creature
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
,
"
said
he
,
"
I
came
to
tell
you
,
that
after
dinner
we
'll
take
a
turn
,
if
you
please
,
to
Lady
Arthur
's
:
<EOS>
she
has
a
family
of
London
friends
for
her
guests
,
and
begs
I
will
prevail
upon
you
to
give
her
your
company
,
and
attend
you
myself
,
only
to
drink
tea
with
her
;
for
I
have
told
her
we
are
to
have
friends
to
sup
with
us
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
attend
you
,
Sir
,
"
replied
I
,
"
most
willingly
;
although
I
doubt
I
am
to
be
made
a
shew
of
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Something
like
it
,
"
said
he
,
"
<EOS>
for
she
has
promised
them
this
favour
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
need
not
dress
otherwise
than
I
am
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
he
was
pleased
to
say
,
I
was
always
what
he
wished
me
to
be
.
  
<EOS>
So
he
left
me
to
my
good
works
<EOS>
(
those
were
his
kind
words
)
and
I
ran
over
Mrs.
Jervis
's
accounts
,
and
found
a
balance
drawn
of
all
her
matters
in
one
leaf
,
and
a
thankful
acknowledgment
to
God
,
for
her
master
's
last
bounty
,
which
had
enabled
her
to
give
satisfaction
to
others
,
and
to
do
herself
great
pleasure
,
written
underneath
.
  
<EOS>
The
balance
of
all
was
thirty
-
five
pounds
eleven
shillings
and
odd
pence
;
and
I
went
to
my
escritoir
,
and
took
out
forty
pounds
,
and
down
<EOS>
I
hasted
to
my
good
Mrs.
Jervis
,
and
I
said
to
her
,
"
Here
,
my
dear
good
friend
,
is
your
pocket
-
book
;
but
are
thirty
-
five
or
thirty
-
six
pounds
all
you
owe
,
or
are
bound
for
in
the
world
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
,
Madam
,
"
said
she
,
"
and
enough
too
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
great
sum
;
but
'
tis
in
four
hands
,
and
they
are
all
in
pretty
good
circumstances
,
and
so
convinced
of
my
honesty
,
that
they
will
never
trouble
me
for
it
;
for
I
have
reduced
the
debt
every
year
something
,
since
I
have
been
in
my
master
's
service
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nor
shall
it
ever
be
in
any
body
's
power
,
"
said
I
,
"
to
trouble
you
:
<EOS>
I
'll
tell
you
how
we
'll
order
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
So
I
sat
down
,
and
made
her
sit
by
me
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Here
,
my
dear
Mrs.
Jervis
,
is
forty
pounds
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
so
much
to
me
now
,
as
the
two
guineas
were
to
you
,
that
you
would
have
given
me
at
my
going
away
from
this
house
to
my
father
's
,
as
I
thought
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
give
it
you
neither
,
at
least
at
present
,
as
you
shall
hear
:
indeed
I
wo
n't
make
you
so
uneasy
as
that
comes
to
.
<EOS>
But
take
this
,
and
pay
the
thirty
-
five
pounds
odd
money
to
the
utmost
farthing
;
and
the
remaining
four
pounds
odd
will
be
a
little
fund
in
advance
towards
the
children
's
schooling
.
<EOS>
And
thus
you
shall
repay
it
;
I
always
designed
,
as
our
dear
master
added
five
guineas
per
annum
to
your
salary
,
in
acknowledgement
of
the
pleasure
he
took
in
your
services
,
when
I
was
Pamela
Andrews
,
to
add
five
pounds
per
annum
to
it
from
the
time
I
became
<EOS>
Mrs.
B.
But
from
that
time
,
for
so
many
years
to
come
,
you
shall
receive
no
more
than
you
did
,
till
the
whole
forty
pounds
be
repaid
.
<EOS>
So
,
my
dear
Mrs.
Jervis
,
you
wo
n't
have
any
obligation
to
me
,
you
know
,
but
for
the
advance
;
and
that
is
a
poor
matter
,
not
to
be
spoken
of
:
<EOS>
and
I
will
have
leave
for
it
,
for
fear
I
should
die
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Had
your
ladyship
seen
the
dear
good
woman
's
behaviour
,
on
this
occasion
,
you
would
never
have
forgotten
it
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
speak
;
tears
ran
down
her
cheeks
in
plentiful
currents
:
her
modest
hand
put
gently
from
her
my
offering
hand
,
her
bosom
heav'd
,
and
she
sobb'd
<EOS>
with
the
painful
tumult
that
seemed
to
struggle
within
her
,
and
which
,
for
some
few
moments
,
made
her
incapable
of
speaking
.
  
<EOS>
At
last
,
I
rising
,
and
putting
my
arm
round
her
neck
,
wiping
her
eyes
,
and
kissing
her
cheek
,
she
cried
,
"
<EOS>
My
excellent
lady
!
'
<EOS>
tis
too
much
!
<EOS>
I
can
not
bear
all
this
.
"
 
<EOS>
She
then
threw
herself
at
my
feet
;
for
I
was
not
strong
enough
to
hinder
it
;
and
with
uplifted
hands
 
"
May
God
Almighty
,
"
said
she
 
<EOS>
I
kneeled
by
her
,
and
clasping
her
hands
in
mine
,
both
uplifted
together
 
"
May
God
Almighty
,
"
said
I
,
drowning
her
voice
with
my
louder
voice
,
"
bless
us
both
together
,
for
many
happy
years
!
<EOS>
And
bless
and
reward
the
dear
gentleman
,
who
has
thus
enabled
me
to
make
the
widow
's
heart
to
sing
for
joy
!
"
  
<EOS>
And
thus
,
my
lady
,
did
I
force
upon
the
good
woman
's
acceptance
the
forty
pounds
.
  
<EOS>
Permit
me
,
Madam
,
to
close
this
letter
here
,
and
to
resume
the
subject
in
my
next
:
till
when
I
have
the
honour
to
be
your
ladyship
's
most
obliged
and
faithful
servant
,
  
P.B.
    
MY
DEAR
LADY
,
  
<EOS>
I
now
resume
my
last
subject
where
I
left
off
,
that
your
ladyship
may
have
the
whole
before
you
at
one
view
.
  
<EOS>
I
went
after
dinner
,
with
my
dear
benefactor
,
to
Lady
Arthur
's
;
and
met
with
fresh
calls
upon
me
for
humility
,
having
the
two
natural
effects
of
the
praises
and
professed
admiration
of
that
lady
's
guests
,
as
well
as
my
dear
Mr.
B.
's
,
and
those
of
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Arthur
,
to
guard
myself
against
:
and
your
good
brother
was
pleased
to
entertain
me
in
the
chariot
,
going
and
coming
,
with
an
account
of
the
orders
he
had
given
in
relation
to
the
London
house
,
which
is
actually
taken
,
and
the
furniture
he
should
direct
for
it
;
so
that
I
had
no
opportunity
to
tell
him
what
I
had
done
in
relation
to
Mrs.
Jervis
.
  
<EOS>
But
after
supper
,
retiring
from
company
to
my
closet
,
when
his
friends
were
gone
,
he
came
up
to
me
about
our
usual
bedtime
<EOS>
:
he
enquired
kindly
after
my
employment
,
which
was
trying
to
read
in
the
French
Telemachus
:
for
,
my
lady
,
I
'm
learning
French
<EOS>
,
I
'll
assure
you
!
<EOS>
And
who
,
do
you
think
,
is
my
master
?
 
<EOS>
Why
,
the
best
I
could
have
in
the
world
,
your
dearest
brother
,
who
is
pleased
to
say
,
I
am
no
dunce
:
<EOS>
how
inexcusable
should
I
be
,
if
I
was
,
with
such
a
master
,
who
teaches
me
on
his
knee
,
and
rewards
me
with
a
kiss
whenever
I
do
well
,
and
says
,
I
have
already
nearly
mastered
the
accent
and
pronunciation
,
which
he
tells
me
<EOS>
is
a
great
difficulty
got
over
.
  
<EOS>
I
requested
him
to
render
for
me
into
English
two
or
three
places
that
were
beyond
my
reach
;
and
when
he
had
done
it
,
he
asked
me
,
in
French
,
what
I
had
done
for
Mrs.
Jervis
.
  
<EOS>
I
said
,
"
Permit
me
,
Sir
(
for
I
am
not
proficient
enough
to
answer
you
in
my
new
tongue
)
,
in
English
,
to
say
,
I
have
made
the
good
woman
quite
happy
;
<EOS>
and
if
I
have
your
approbation
,
I
shall
be
as
much
so
myself
in
this
instance
,
as
I
am
in
all
others
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
dare
answer
for
your
prudence
,
my
dear
,
"
he
was
pleased
to
say
:
"
but
this
is
your
favourite
:
let
me
know
,
when
you
have
so
bountiful
a
heart
to
strangers
,
what
you
do
for
your
favourites
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
then
said
,
"
Permit
my
bold
eye
,
Sir
,
to
watch
yours
,
as
I
obey
you
;
and
you
know
you
must
not
look
full
upon
me
then
<EOS>
;
for
if
you
do
,
how
shall
I
look
at
you
again
;
how
see
,
as
I
proceed
,
whether
you
are
displeased
?
<EOS>
for
you
will
not
chide
me
in
words
,
so
partial
have
you
the
goodness
to
be
to
all
I
do
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
put
his
arm
round
me
,
and
looked
down
now
and
then
,
as
I
desired
!
<EOS>
for
O
!
<EOS>
Madam
,
he
is
all
condescension
and
goodness
to
his
unworthy
,
yet
grateful
Pamela
!
<EOS>
I
told
him
all
I
have
written
to
you
about
the
forty
pounds
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
now
,
dear
Sir
,
"
said
I
,
half
hiding
my
face
on
his
shoulder
,
"
you
have
heard
what
I
have
done
,
chide
or
beat
your
Pamela
,
if
you
please
:
it
shall
be
all
kind
from
you
,
and
matter
of
future
direction
and
caution
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
raised
my
head
,
and
kissed
me
two
or
three
times
,
saying
,
"
Thus
then
I
chide
,
I
beat
,
my
angel
!
 
<EOS>
And
yet
I
have
one
fault
to
find
with
you
,
and
let
Mrs.
Jervis
,
if
not
in
bed
,
come
up
to
us
,
and
hear
what
it
is
;
for
I
will
expose
you
,
as
you
deserve
before
her
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
My
Polly
being
in
hearing
,
attending
to
know
if
I
wanted
her
assistance
to
undress
,
I
bade
her
call
Mrs.
Jervis
.
<EOS>
And
though
I
thought
from
his
kind
looks
,
and
kind
words
,
as
well
as
tender
behaviour
,
that
I
had
not
much
to
fear
,
yet
I
was
impatient
to
know
what
my
fault
was
,
for
which
I
was
to
be
exposed
.
  
<EOS>
The
good
woman
came
;
and
as
she
entered
with
all
that
modesty
which
is
so
graceful
in
her
,
he
moved
his
chair
further
from
me
,
and
,
with
a
set
aspect
,
but
not
unpleasant
,
said
,
"
Step
in
<EOS>
,
Mrs.
Jervis
:
your
lady
"
<EOS>
(
for
so
,
Madam
,
he
will
always
call
me
to
Mrs.
Jervis
,
and
to
the
servants
)
"
has
incurred
my
censure
,
and
I
would
not
tell
her
in
what
,
till
I
had
you
face
to
face
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
looked
surprised
 
now
on
me
,
now
on
her
dear
master
;
and
<EOS>
I
,
not
knowing
what
he
would
say
,
looked
a
little
attentive
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
 
I
am
very
sorry
for
it
,
Sir
,
"
said
she
,
curtseying
low
:
 
"
but
should
be
more
sorry
,
if
I
were
the
unhappy
occasion
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
Mrs.
Jervis
,
I
ca
n't
say
but
<EOS>
it
is
on
your
account
that
I
must
blame
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
This
gave
us
both
confusion
,
but
especially
the
good
woman
;
for
still
I
hoped
much
from
his
kind
behaviour
to
me
just
before
 
<EOS>
and
she
said
,
"
Indeed
,
Sir
,
I
could
never
deserve
"
  
<EOS>
He
interrupted
her
 
<EOS>
"
My
charge
against
you
,
Pamela
,
"
said
he
,
"
is
that
of
niggardliness
,
and
no
other
;
for
I
will
put
you
both
out
of
your
pain
:
you
ought
not
to
have
found
out
the
method
of
repayment
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
dear
creature
,
"
said
he
,
to
Mrs.
Jervis
,
"
seldom
does
any
thing
that
can
be
mended
;
but
,
I
think
,
when
your
good
conduct
deserved
an
annual
acknowledgment
from
me
,
in
addition
to
your
salary
,
the
lady
should
have
shewed
herself
no
less
pleased
with
your
service
than
the
gentleman
.
<EOS>
Had
it
been
for
old
acquaintance
-
sake
,
for
sex
-
sake
<EOS>
,
she
should
not
have
given
me
cause
to
upbraid
her
on
this
head
.
<EOS>
But
I
will
tell
you
,
that
you
must
look
upon
the
forty
pounds
you
have
,
as
the
effect
of
just
distinction
on
many
accounts
:
and
your
salary
from
last
quarter
-
day
shall
be
advanced
,
as
the
dear
niggard
intended
it
some
years
hence
;
and
let
me
only
add
,
that
when
my
Pamela
first
begins
to
shew
a
coldness
to
her
Mrs.
Jervis
,
I
shall
then
suspect
she
is
beginning
to
decline
in
that
humble
virtue
,
which
is
now
peculiar
to
herself
and
makes
her
the
delight
of
all
who
converse
with
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
was
thus
pleased
to
say
:
thus
,
with
the
most
graceful
generosity
,
and
a
nobleness
of
mind
truly
peculiar
to
himself
,
was
he
pleased
to
act
:
and
what
could
Mrs.
Jervis
or
I
say
to
him
?
 
<EOS>
Why
,
indeed
,
nothing
at
all
!
 
<EOS>
We
could
only
look
upon
one
another
,
with
our
eyes
and
our
hearts
full
of
a
gratitude
that
would
not
permit
either
of
us
to
speak
,
but
which
expressed
itself
at
last
in
a
manner
he
was
pleased
to
call
more
elegant
than
words
 
with
uplifted
folded
hands
,
and
tears
of
joy
.
  
<EOS>
O
my
dear
lady
!
<EOS>
how
many
opportunities
have
the
beneficent
rich
to
make
themselves
,
as
well
as
their
fellow
-
creatures
,
happy
!
<EOS>
All
that
I
could
think
,
or
say
,
or
act
,
was
but
my
duty
before
;
what
a
sense
of
obligation
then
must
I
lie
under
to
this
most
generous
of
men
!
  
<EOS>
But
here
let
me
put
an
end
to
this
tedious
subject
;
the
principal
part
of
which
can
have
no
excuse
,
if
it
may
not
serve
as
a
proof
of
my
cheerful
compliance
with
your
ladyship
's
commands
,
that
I
recite
every
thing
of
concern
to
me
,
and
with
the
same
freedom
as
I
used
to
do
to
my
dear
parents
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
done
it
,
and
at
the
same
time
offered
what
I
had
to
plead
in
behalf
of
my
conduct
to
the
two
housekeepers
,
which
you
expected
from
me
;
and
I
shall
therefore
close
this
my
humble
defence
,
if
I
may
so
call
it
,
with
the
assurance
that
I
am
,
my
dearest
lady
,
your
obliged
and
faithful
servant
,
  
P.B.
    
From
Lady
Davers
to
Mrs.
B.
in
answer
to
the
six
last
Letters
.
  
<EOS>
"
Where
she
had
it
,
I
ca
n't
tell
I
<EOS>
but
I
think
I
never
met
with
the
fellow
of
her
in
my
life
,
at
any
age
;
"
are
,
as
I
remember
,
my
brother
's
words
,
speaking
of
his
Pamela
in
the
early
part
of
your
papers
.
<EOS>
In
truth
,
thou
art
a
surprising
creature
;
and
every
letter
we
have
from
you
,
we
have
new
subjects
to
admire
you
for
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
you
think
,
Lady
Betty
,
"
said
I
,
when
I
had
read
to
the
end
of
the
subject
about
Mrs.
Jervis
,
"
I
will
not
soon
set
out
to
hit
this
charming
girl
a
box
of
the
ear
or
two
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
For
what
,
Lady
Davers
?
"
said
she
.
  
<EOS>
"
For
what
!
"
replied
I.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
do
n't
you
see
how
many
slaps
of
the
face
<EOS>
the
bold
slut
hits
me
!
<EOS>
I
'll
LADY
-
AIRS
her
!
<EOS>
I
will
.
<EOS>
I
'll
teach
her
to
reproach
me
,
and
so
many
of
her
betters
,
with
her
cottage
excellencies
,
and
improvements
,
that
shame
our
education
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Why
,
you
dear
charming
Pamela
,
did
you
only
excel
me
in
words
,
I
could
forgive
you
:
for
there
may
be
a
knack
,
and
a
volubility
,
as
to
words
,
that
a
natural
talent
may
supply
;
but
to
be
thus
out
-
done
in
thought
and
in
deed
,
who
can
bear
it
?
<EOS>
And
in
so
young
an
insulter
too
!
  
<EOS>
Well
,
Pamela
,
look
to
it
,
when
I
see
you
:
you
shall
feel
the
weight
of
my
hand
,
or
 
the
pressure
of
my
lip
,
one
or
t'other
,
depend
on
it
,
very
quickly
;
for
here
,
instead
of
my
stooping
,
as
I
thought
I
would
be
,
to
call
you
sister
,
I
shall
be
forced
to
think
,
in
a
little
while
,
that
you
ought
not
to
own
me
as
yours
,
till
I
am
nearer
your
standard
.
  
<EOS>
But
to
come
to
business
,
I
will
summarily
take
notice
of
the
following
particulars
in
all
your
obliging
letters
,
in
order
to
convince
you
of
my
friendship
,
by
the
freedom
of
my
observations
on
the
subjects
you
touch
upon
.
  
<EOS>
First
,
then
,
I
am
highly
pleased
with
what
you
write
of
the
advantages
you
received
from
the
favour
of
my
dear
mother
;
and
as
you
know
many
things
of
her
by
your
attendance
upon
her
the
last
three
or
four
years
of
her
life
,
I
must
desire
you
will
give
me
,
as
opportunity
shall
offer
,
all
you
can
recollect
in
relation
to
the
honoured
lady
,
and
of
her
behaviour
and
kindness
to
you
,
and
with
a
retrospect
to
your
own
early
beginnings
,
the
dawnings
of
this
your
bright
day
of
excellence
:
and
this
not
only
I
,
but
the
countess
,
and
Lady
Betty
,
with
whom
I
am
going
over
your
papers
again
,
and
her
sister
,
Lady
Jenny
,
request
of
you
.
  
<EOS>
2
.
<EOS>
I
am
much
pleased
with
your
Kentish
account
;
though
we
wished
you
had
been
more
particular
in
some
parts
of
it
;
for
we
are
greatly
taken
with
your
descriptions
:
and
your
conversation
pieces
:
yet
I
own
,
your
honest
father
's
letters
,
and
yours
,
a
good
deal
supply
that
defect
.
  
<EOS>

.
<EOS>
I
am
highly
delighted
with
your
account
of
my
brother
's
breaking
to
you
the
affair
of
Sally
Godfrey
,
and
your
conduct
upon
it
.
'
<EOS>
Tis
a
sweet
story
as
he
brought
it
in
,
and
as
you
relate
it
.
<EOS>
The
wretch
has
been
very
just
in
his
account
of
it
.
<EOS>
We
are
in
love
with
your
charitable
reflections
in
favour
of
the
poor
lady
;
and
the
more
,
as
she
certainly
deserved
them
,
and
a
better
mother
too
than
she
had
,
and
a
faithfuller
lover
than
she
met
with
.
  
<EOS>
4
.
<EOS>
You
have
exactly
hit
his
temper
in
your
declared
love
of
Miss
Goodwill
.
<EOS>
I
see
,
child
,
you
know
your
man
;
and
never
fear
<EOS>
but
you
'll
hold
him
,
if
you
can
go
on
thus
to
act
,
and
outdo
your
sex
.
<EOS>
But
I
should
think
you
might
as
well
not
insist
upon
having
her
with
you
;
you
'd
better
see
her
now
<EOS>
and
then
at
the
dairy
-
house
,
or
at
school
,
than
have
her
with
you
.
<EOS>
But
this
I
leave
to
your
own
discretion
.
  
<EOS>
5
.
<EOS>
You
have
satisfactorily
answered
our
objections
to
your
behaviour
to
Mrs.
Jewkes
.
<EOS>
We
had
not
considered
your
circumstances
quite
so
thoroughly
as
we
ought
to
have
done
.
<EOS>
You
are
a
charming
girl
,
and
all
your
motives
are
so
just
,
that
we
shall
be
a
little
more
cautious
for
the
future
how
we
censure
you
.
  
<EOS>
In
short
,
I
say
with
the
countess
,
"
This
good
girl
is
not
without
her
pride
;
but
it
is
the
pride
that
becomes
,
and
can
only
attend
the
innocent
heart
;
and
I
'll
warrant
,
"
said
her
ladyship
,
"
nobody
will
become
her
station
so
well
,
as
one
who
is
capable
of
so
worthy
a
pride
as
this
.
"
  
<EOS>
But
what
a
curtain
-
lecture
hadst
thou
,
Pamela
!
<EOS>
A
noble
one
,
dost
thou
call
it
?
 
<EOS>
Why
,
what
a
wretch
hast
thou
got
,
to
expect
thou
shouldst
never
expostulate
against
his
lordly
will
,
even
when
in
the
wrong
,
till
thou
hast
obeyed
it
,
and
of
consequence
,
joined
in
the
evil
he
imposes
!
  
<EOS>
Much
good
<EOS>
may
such
a
husband
do
you
,
says
Lady
Betty
!
 
<EOS>
Every
body
will
admire
you
,
but
no
one
will
have
reason
to
envy
you
upon
those
principles
.
  
<EOS>

.
<EOS>
I
am
pleased
with
your
promise
of
sending
what
you
think
I
shall
like
to
see
,
out
of
those
papers
you
choose
not
to
shew
me
collectively
:
this
is
very
obliging
.
<EOS>
You
're
a
good
girl
;
and
I
love
you
dearly
.
  
<EOS>
7
.
<EOS>
We
have
all
smiled
at
your
paradox
,
Pamela
,
that
his
marrying
you
was
an
instance
of
his
pride
.
 
<EOS>
The
thought
,
though
,
is
pretty
enough
,
and
ingenious
;
but
whether
it
will
hold
or
not
,
I
wo
n't
just
now
examine
.
  
<EOS>
8
.
<EOS>
Your
observation
on
the
forget
and
forgive
<EOS>
we
are
much
pleased
with
.
  
<EOS>
9
.
<EOS>
You
are
very
good
in
sending
me
a
copy
of
Miss
Darnford
's
letter
.
<EOS>
She
is
a
charming
young
lady
.
<EOS>
I
always
had
a
great
opinion
of
her
merit
;
her
letter
abundantly
confirms
me
in
it
.
<EOS>
I
hope
you
'll
communicate
to
me
every
letter
that
passes
between
you
,
and
pray
send
in
your
next
a
copy
of
your
answer
to
her
letter
:
I
must
insist
upon
it
,
I
think
.
  
<EOS>
10
.
<EOS>
I
am
glad
,
with
all
my
heart
,
to
hear
of
poor
Jewkes
's
reformation
:
Your
example
carries
all
before
it
.
<EOS>
But
pray
oblige
me
with
your
answer
to
her
letter
,
do
n't
think
me
unreasonable
:
'
tis
all
for
your
sake
.
  
<EOS>
Pray
 
<EOS>
have
you
shewn
Jewkes
's
letter
to
your
good
friend
?
 
<EOS>
Lady
Betty
wants
to
know
(
if
you
have
)
what
he
could
say
to
it
?
<EOS>
For
,
she
says
,
it
cuts
him
to
the
quick
.
<EOS>
And
I
think
so
too
,
if
he
takes
it
as
he
ought
:
<EOS>
but
,
as
you
say
,
he
's
above
loving
virtue
for
virtue
's
sake
.
  
<EOS>
11
.
<EOS>
Your
manner
of
acting
by
Mrs.
Jervis
,
with
so
handsome
a
regard
to
my
brother
's
interest
,
her
behaviour
upon
it
,
and
your
relation
of
the
whole
,
and
of
his
generous
spirit
in
approving
,
reproving
,
and
improving
,
your
prudent
generosity
,
make
no
inconsiderable
figure
in
your
papers
.
<EOS>
And
Lady
Betty
says
,
"
Hang
him
,
he
has
some
excellent
qualities
too
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
impossible
not
to
think
well
of
him
;
and
his
good
actions
go
a
great
way
towards
atoning
for
his
bad
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
you
,
Pamela
,
have
the
glory
of
all
.
  
<EOS>
12
.
<EOS>
I
am
glad
you
are
learning
French
:
<EOS>
thou
art
<EOS>
a
happy
girl
in
thy
teacher
,
and
he
is
a
happy
man
in
his
scholar
.
<EOS>
We
are
pleased
with
your
pretty
account
of
his
method
of
instructing
and
rewarding
.
 
<EOS>
'
Twould
be
strange
,
if
you
did
not
thus
learn
any
language
quickly
,
with
such
encouragements
,
from
the
man
you
love
,
were
your
genius
less
apt
than
it
is
.
<EOS>
But
we
wished
you
had
enlarged
on
that
subject
:
for
such
fondness
of
men
to
their
wives
,
who
have
been
any
time
married
,
is
so
rare
,
and
so
unexpected
from
my
brother
,
that
we
thought
you
should
have
written
a
side
upon
that
subject
at
least
.
  
<EOS>
What
a
bewitching
girl
art
thou
!
<EOS>
What
an
exemplar
to
wives
now
,
as
well
as
thou
wast
before
to
maidens
!
<EOS>
Thou
canst
tame
lions
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
,
if
thoud'st
try
.
 
<EOS>
Reclaim
a
rake
in
the
meridian
of
his
libertinism
,
and
make
such
an
one
as
my
brother
,
not
only
marry
thee
,
but
love
thee
better
at
several
months
'
end
,
than
he
did
the
first
day
,
if
possible
!
  
<EOS>
Now
,
my
dear
Pamela
,
I
think
I
have
taken
notice
of
the
most
material
articles
in
your
letters
,
and
have
no
more
to
say
to
you
;
but
write
on
,
and
oblige
us
;
and
mind
to
send
me
the
copy
of
your
letter
to
Miss
Darnford
,
of
that
you
wrote
to
poor
penitent
Jewkes
,
and
every
article
I
have
written
about
,
and
all
that
comes
into
your
head
,
or
that
passes
,
and
you
'll
oblige
yours
,
&
c
,

DAVERS

<EOS>
MY
DEAR
LADY
,
  
<EOS>
I
read
with
pleasure
your
commands
,
in
your
last
kind
and
obliging
letter
:
and
you
may
be
sure
of
a
ready
obedience
in
every
one
of
them
<EOS>
,
that
is
in
my
power
.
  
<EOS>
That
which
I
can
most
easily
do
,
I
will
first
do
;
and
that
is
,
to
transcribe
the
answer
I
sent
to
Miss
Darnford
,
and
that
to
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
the
former
of
which
,
(
and
a
long
one
it
is
)
is
as
follows
:
  
"
DEAR
MISS
DARNFORD
,
  
<EOS>
"
I
begin
now
to
be
afraid
I
shall
not
have
the
pleasure
and
benefit
<EOS>
I
promised
myself
of
passing
a
fortnight
or
three
weeks
at
the
Hall
,
in
your
sweet
conversation
,
and
that
of
your
worthy
family
,
as
well
as
those
others
in
your
agreeable
neighbourhood
,
whom
I
must
always
remember
with
equal
honour
and
delight
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
occasion
will
be
principally
,
that
we
expect
,
very
soon
,
Lord
and
Lady
Davers
,
who
propose
to
tarry
here
a
fortnight
at
least
;
and
after
that
,
the
advanced
season
will
carry
us
to
London
,
where
Mr.
B.
has
taken
a
house
for
his
winter
residence
,
and
in
order
to
attend
parliament
:
a
service
he
says
,
which
he
has
been
more
deficient
in
hitherto
,
than
he
can
either
answer
to
his
constituents
,
or
to
his
own
conscience
;
for
though
he
is
but
one
,
yet
if
any
good
motion
should
be
lost
by
one
,
every
absent
member
,
who
is
independent
,
has
to
reproach
himself
with
the
consequence
of
the
loss
of
that
good
which
might
otherwise
redound
to
the
commonwealth
.
<EOS>
And
besides
,
he
says
,
such
excuses
as
he
could
make
,
every
one
might
plead
;
and
then
public
affairs
might
as
well
be
left
to
the
administration
,
and
no
parliament
be
chosen
.
  
<EOS>
"
See
you
,
my
dear
Miss
Darnford
,
from
the
humble
cottager
,
what
a
public
person
your
favourite
friend
is
grown
!
<EOS>
How
easy
is
it
for
a
bold
mind
to
look
forward
,
and
,
perhaps
,
forgetting
what
she
was
,
now
she
imagines
she
has
a
stake
in
the
country
,
takes
upon
herself
to
be
as
important
,
as
significant
,
as
if
,
like
my
dear
Miss
Darnford
,
she
had
been
born
to
it
!
  
<EOS>
"
Well
;
but
may
I
not
ask
,
whether
,
if
the
mountain
can
not
come
to
Mahomet
,
Mahomet
will
not
come
to
the
mountain
?
<EOS>
Since
Lady
Davers
's
visit
is
so
uncertain
as
to
its
beginning
and
duration
,
and
so
great
a
favour
as
I
am
to
look
upon
it
,
and
really
shall
<EOS>
,
it
being
her
first
visit
to
me
:
 
and
since
we
must
go
and
take
possession
of
our
London
residence
,
why
ca
n't
Sir
Simon
spare
to
us
the
dear
lady
whom
he
could
use
hardly
,
and
whose
attendance
(
though
he
is
indeed
entitled
to
all
her
duty
)
<EOS>
he
did
not
,
just
in
that
instance
,
quite
so
much
deserve
?
  
<EOS>
"
"
Well
,
but
after
all
,
Sir
Simon
,
"
would
I
say
,
if
I
had
been
in
presence
at
his
peevish
hour
,
"
you
are
a
fine
gentleman
,
are
you
not
?
<EOS>
to
take
such
a
method
to
shew
your
good
daughter
,
that
because
she
did
not
come
soon
enough
to
you
,
she
came
too
soon
!
<EOS>
And
did
ever
papa
before
you
put
a
good
book
(
for
<EOS>
such
I
doubt
not
it
was
,
because
you
were
in
affliction
,
though
so
little
affected
by
its
precepts
)
to
such
a
bad
use
?
<EOS>
As
parents
"
examples
are
so
prevalent
,
suppose
your
daughter
had
taken
it
,
and
flung
it
at
her
sister
;
Miss
Nancy
at
her
waiting
-
maid
;
and
so
it
had
gone
through
the
family
;
would
it
not
have
been
an
excuse
for
every
one
to
say
,
that
the
father
,
and
head
of
the
family
had
set
the
example
?
  
<EOS>
"
"
You
almost
wish
,
my
dear
Miss
tells
me
,
that
I
would
undertake
you
!
 
<EOS>
This
is
very
good
of
you
.
<EOS>
Sir
Simon
,
"
I
might
(
would
his
patience
have
suffered
me
to
run
on
thus
)
have
added
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
hope
,
since
you
are
so
sensible
that
you
want
to
be
undertaken
,
(
<EOS>
and
since
this
peevish
rashness
convinces
me
that
you
do
)
that
you
will
undertake
yourself
;
that
you
will
not
,
when
your
indisposition
requires
the
attendance
and
duty
of
your
dear
lady
and
daughter
,
make
it
more
uncomfortable
to
them
,
by
adding
a
difficulty
of
being
pleased
,
and
an
impatience
of
spirit
,
to
the
concern
<EOS>
their
duty
and
affection
make
them
have
for
you
;
and
,
at
least
,
resolve
never
to
take
a
book
into
your
hand
again
,
if
you
can
not
make
a
better
use
of
it
,
than
you
did
then
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
But
Sir
Simon
will
say
,
I
have
already
undertaken
him
,
were
he
to
see
this
.
<EOS>
Yet
my
Lady
Darnford
once
begged
I
would
give
him
a
hint
or
two
on
this
subject
,
which
,
she
was
pleased
to
say
,
would
be
better
received
from
me
than
from
any
body
:
and
if
it
be
a
little
too
severe
,
it
is
but
<EOS>
a
just
reprisal
made
by
one
whose
ears
,
he
knows
,
he
has
cruelly
wounded
more
than
once
,
twice
,
or
thrice
,
besides
,
by
what
he
calls
his
innocent
double
entendres
,
and
who
,
if
she
had
not
resented
it
,
when
an
opportunity
offered
,
must
have
been
believed
,
by
him
,
to
be
neither
more
nor
less
than
a
hypocrite
.
<EOS>
There
's
for
you
,
Sir
Simon
:
<EOS>
and
so
here
ends
all
my
malice
;
for
now
I
have
spoken
my
mind
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yet
I
hope
your
dear
papa
will
not
be
so
angry
as
to
deny
me
,
for
this
my
freedom
,
the
request
I
make
to
him
,
to
your
mamma
,
and
to
your
dear
self
,
for
your
beloved
company
,
for
a
month
or
two
in
Bedfordshire
,
and
at
London
:
and
if
you
might
be
permitted
to
winter
with
us
at
the
latter
,
how
happy
should
I
be
!
<EOS>
It
will
be
half
done
the
moment
you
desire
it
.
<EOS>
Sir
Simon
loves
you
too
well
to
refuse
you
,
if
you
are
earnest
in
it
.
<EOS>
Your
honoured
mamma
is
always
indulgent
to
your
requests
:
and
Mr.
B.
as
well
in
kindness
to
me
,
as
for
the
great
respect
he
bears
you
,
joins
with
me
to
beg
this
favour
of
you
,
and
of
Sir
Simon
and
my
lady
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
it
can
be
obtained
,
what
pleasure
and
improvement
may
I
not
propose
to
myself
,
with
so
polite
a
companion
,
when
we
are
carried
by
Mr.
B.
to
the
play
,
the
opera
,
and
other
of
the
town
diversions
!
<EOS>
We
will
work
,
visit
,
read
,
and
sing
together
,
and
improve
one
another
;
you
me
,
in
every
word
you
shall
speak
,
in
every
thing
you
shall
do
;
I
you
,
by
my
questions
,
and
desire
of
information
,
which
will
make
you
open
all
your
breast
to
me
:
and
so
unlocking
that
dear
storehouse
of
virtuous
knowledge

improve
your
own
notions
the
more
for
communicating
them
.
<EOS>
O
my
dear
Miss
Damford
I
how
happy
is
it
in
your
power
to
make
me
!
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
much
affected
with
your
account
of
Mrs.
Jewkes
's
reformation
,
I
could
have
wished
,
had
I
not
other
and
stronger
inducements
(
in
the
pleasure
of
so
agreeable
a
neighbourhood
,
and
so
sweet
a
companion
)
<EOS>
,
I
could
have
been
down
at
the
Hall
,
in
hopes
to
have
confirmed
the
poor
woman
in
her
newly
assumed
penitence
.
<EOS>
God
give
her
grace
to
persevere
in
it
!
 
<EOS>
To
be
an
humble
means
of
saving
a
soul
from
perdition
!
<EOS>
O
my
dear
Miss
Darnford
,
let
me
enjoy
that
heart
-
ravishing
hope
!
 
<EOS>
To
pluck
such
a
brand
as
this
out
of
the
fire
,
and
to
assist
to
quench
its
flaming
susceptibility
for
mischief
,
and
make
it
useful
to
edifying
purposes
,
what
a
pleasure
does
this
afford
one
!
<EOS>
How
does
it
encourage
one
to
proceed
in
the
way
one
has
been
guided
to
pursue
!
<EOS>
How
does
it
make
me
hope
,
that
I
am
raised
to
my
present
condition
,
in
order
to
be
an
humble
instrument
in
the
hand
of
Providence
to
communicate
great
good
to
others
,
and
so
extend
to
many
those
benefits
I
have
received
,
which
,
were
they
to
go
no
further
than
myself
,
<EOS>
what
a
vile
,
what
an
ungrateful
creature
should
I
be
!
  
<EOS>
"
I
see
,
my
dearest
Miss
Darnford
,
how
useful
in
every
condition
of
life
a
virtuous
and
a
serious
turn
of
mind
may
be
!
  
<EOS>
"
In
hopes
of
seeing
you
with
us
,
I
will
not
enlarge
on
several
agreeable
subjects
,
which
I
could
touch
upon
with
pleasure
,
besides
what
I
gave
you
in
my
former
(
of
my
reception
here
,

of
the
kindness
of
our
genteel
neighbours

:
<EOS>
such
,
particularly
,
as
the
arrival
here
of
my
dear
parents
,
and
the
kind
,
generous
entertainment
they
met
with
from
my
best
friend
<EOS>
;
his
condescension
in
not
only
permitting
me
to
attend
them
to
Kent
,
but
accompanying
us
thither
,
and
settling
them
in
a
most
happy
manner
,
beyond
their
wishes
and
my
own
;
but
yet
so
much
in
character
,
as
I
may
say
,
that
every
one
must
approve
his
judicious
benevolence
;
the
favours
of
my
good
Lady
Davers
to
me
,
who
,
pleased
with
my
letters
,
has
vouchsafed
to
become
my
correspondent
;

a
thousand
things
,
which
I
want
personally
to
communicate
to
my
dear
Miss
Darnford

Be
pleased

P.B.
"
  
This
,
my
good
lady
,
is
the
long
letter
I
sent
to
Miss
Darnford
,
who
,
at
parting
,
engaged
me
to
keep
up
a
correspondence
with
her
,
and
put
me
in
hopes
of
passing
a
month
or
two
at
the
Hall
,
if
we
came
down
,
and
if
she
could
persuade
Sir
Simon
and
her
mamma
to
spare
her
to
my
wishes
.
<EOS>
Your
ladyship
will
excuse
me
for
so
faintly
mentioning
the
honours
you
confer
upon
me
:
but
I
would
not
either
add
or
diminish
in
the
communications
I
make
to
you
.
  
<EOS>
The
following
is
the
copy
of
what
I
wrote
to
Mrs.
Jewkes
:
  
<EOS>
"
You
give
me
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
very
great
pleasure
,
to
find
,
that
,
at
length
,
God
Almighty
has
touched
your
heart
,
and
let
you
see
,
while
health
and
strength
lasted
,
the
error
of
your
ways
.
<EOS>
Many
an
unhappy
one
has
not
been
so
graciously
touched
,
till
they
have
smarted
under
some
heavy
afflictions
,
or
been
confined
to
the
bed
of
sickness
,
when
,
perhaps
,
they
have
made
vows
and
resolutions
,
that
have
held
them
no
longer
than
the
discipline
lasted
;
but
you
give
me
much
better
hopes
of
the
sincerity
of
your
conversion
;
as
you
are
so
well
convinced
,
before
some
sore
evil
has
overtaken
you
:
and
it
ought
to
be
an
earnest
to
you
of
the
Divine
favour
,
and
should
keep
you
from
despondency
.
  
<EOS>
"
As
to
me
,
it
became
me
to
forgive
you
,
as
I
most
cordially
did
;
since
your
usage
of
me
,
as
it
proved
,
was
but
a
necessary
means
in
the
hand
of
Providence
,
to
exalt
me
to
that
state
of
happiness
,
in
which
I
have
every
day
<EOS>
more
and
more
cause
<EOS>
given
me
to
rejoice
,
by
the
kindest
and
most
generous
of
gentlemen
.
  
<EOS>
"
As
I
have
often
prayed
for
you
,
even
when
you
used
me
the
most
unkindly
,
I
now
praise
God
for
having
heard
my
prayers
,
and
with
high
delight
look
upon
you
as
a
reclaimed
soul
given
to
my
supplication
.
<EOS>
May
the
Divine
goodness
enable
you
to
persevere
in
the
course
you
have
begun
!
<EOS>
And
when
you
can
taste
the
all
-
surpassing
pleasure
that
fills
the
worthy
breast
,
on
being
placed
in
a
station
where
your
example
may
be
of
advantage
to
the
souls
of
others
,
as
well
as
to
your
own
 
a
pleasure
that
every
good
mind
glories
in
,
and
none
else
can
truly
relish
;
then
may
you
be
assured
,
that
nothing
but
your
perseverance
,
and
the
consequential
improvement
resulting
from
it
,
is
wanted
to
convince
you
,
that
you
are
in
a
right
way
,
and
that
the
woe
that
is
pronounced
against
the
presumptuous
sinner
,
belongs
not
to
you
.
  
<EOS>
"
Let
me
,
therefore
,
dear
Mrs.
Jewkes
(
for
now
indeed
you
are
dear
to
me
)
,
caution
you
against
two
things
;
the
one
,
that
you
return
not
to
your
former
ways
,
and
wilfully
err
after
this
repentance
;
for
the
Divine
goodness
will
then
look
upon
itself
as
mocked
by
you
,
and
will
withdraw
itself
from
you
;
and
more
dreadful
will
your
state
then
be
,
than
if
you
had
never
repented
:
<EOS>
the
other
,
that
you
do
n't
despair
of
the
Divine
mercy
,
which
has
so
evidently
manifested
itself
in
your
favour
,
and
has
awakened
you
out
of
your
deplorable
lethargy
,
without
those
sharp
medicines
and
operations
,
which
others
,
and
perhaps
not
more
faulty
persons
,
have
suffered
.
<EOS>
But
go
on
cheerfully
in
the
same
happy
path
.
<EOS>
Depend
upon
it
,
you
are
now
in
the
right
way
,
and
turn
not
either
to
the
right
hand
or
to
the
left
;
for
the
reward
is
before
you
,
in
reputation
and
a
good
fame
in
this
life
,
and
everlasting
felicity
beyond
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Your
letter
is
that
of
a
sensible
woman
,
as
I
always
thought
you
;
and
of
a
truly
contrite
one
,
as
I
hope
you
will
prove
yourself
to
be
:
and
<EOS>
I
the
rather
hope
it
,
as
I
shall
be
always
desirous
,
then
of
taking
every
opportunity
that
offers
of
doing
you
real
service
,
as
well
with
regard
to
your
present
as
future
life
:
for
I
am
,
good
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
as
I
now
hope
I
may
call
you
,
your
loving
friend
to
serve
you

Whatever
good
books

the
worthy
Mr.
Peters
will
be
so
kind
as
to
recommend
to
you
,
and
to
those
under
your
direction
,
send
for
them
either
to
Lincoln
,
Stamford
,
or
Grantham
,
and
place
them
to
my
account
:
<EOS>
and
may
they
be
the
effectual
means
of
confirming
you
and
them
in
the
good
way
you
are
in
!
<EOS>
I
have
done
as
much
for
all
here
:
and
,
I
hope
,
to
no
bad
effect
:
for
I
shall
now
tell
them
,
by
Mrs.
Jervis
<EOS>
,
if
there
be
occasion
,
that
I
hope
they
will
not
let
me
be
out

done
in
Bedfordshire
,
by
Mrs.
Jewkes
in
Lincolnshire
;
but
that
the
servants
of
both
houses
may
do
credit
to
the
best
of
masters

Adieu

good
woman

as
once
more
I
take
pleasure
to
style
you

Thus
,
my
good
lady
,
have
I
obeyed
you
,
in
transcribing
these
two
letters
.
<EOS>
I
will
now
proceed
to
your
ladyship
's
twelve
articles
.
<EOS>
As
to
the
  
1
.
<EOS>
I
will
oblige
your
ladyship
,
as
I
have
opportunity
,
in
my
future
letters
,
with
such
accounts
of
my
dear
lady
's
favour
and
goodness
to
me
,
as
I
think
will
be
acceptable
to
you
,
and
to
the
noble
ladies
you
mention
.
  
<EOS>
2
.
<EOS>
I
am
extremely
delighted
,
that
your
ladyship
thinks
so
well
of
my
dear
honest
parents
:
they
are
good
people
,
and
ever
had
minds
that
set
them
above
low
and
sordid
actions
:
and
God
and
your
good
brother
has
rewarded
them
most
amply
in
this
world
,
which
is
more
than
they
ever
expected
,
after
a
series
of
unprosperousness
in
all
they
undertook
.
  
<EOS>
Your
ladyship
is
pleased
to
say
,
that
people
in
upper
life
love
to
see
how
plain
nature
operates
in
honest
minds
,
who
have
hardly
any
thing
else
for
their
guide
:
<EOS>
and
if
I
might
not
be
thought
to
descend
too
low
for
your
ladyship
's
attention
(
for
,
as
to
myself
,
I
shall
,
I
hope
,
always
look
back
with
pleasure
to
what
I
was
,
in
order
to
increase
my
thankfulness
for
what
I
am
)
,
I
would
give
you
a
scene
of
resignation
,
and
contented
poverty
,
of
which
otherwise
you
can
hardly
have
a
notion
.
<EOS>
I
will
give
it
,
because
it
will
be
a
scene
of
nature
,
however
low
,
which
your
ladyship
loves
,
and
it
shall
not
tire
you
by
its
length
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
upon
occasion
of
a
great
loss
and
disappointment
which
happened
to
my
dear
parents
;
for
though
they
were
never
high
in
life
,
yet
they
were
not
always
so
low
as
my
honoured
lady
found
them
,
when
she
took
me
.
<EOS>
My
poor
father
came
home
;
and
as
the
loss
was
of
such
a
nature
,
as
that
he
could
not
keep
it
from
my
mother
,
he
took
her
hand
,
and
said
,
after
he
had
acquainted
her
with
it
,
"
Come
,
my
dear
,
let
us
take
comfort
,
that
we
did
for
the
best
.
<EOS>
We
left
the
issue
to
Providence
,
as
we
ought
,
and
that
has
turned
it
as
it
pleased
;
and
we
must
be
content
,
though
not
favoured
as
we
wished
.
 
<EOS>
All
the
business
is
,
our
lot
is
not
cast
for
this
life
.
<EOS>
Let
us
resign
ourselves
to
the
Divine
will
,
and
continue
to
do
our
duty
,
and
this
short
life
will
soon
be
past
.
<EOS>
Our
troubles
will
be
quickly
overblown
;
and
we
shall
be
happy
in
a
better
<EOS>
,
I
make
no
doubt
.
"
  
<EOS>
Then
my
dear
mother
threw
her
arms
about
his
neck
,
and
said
,
with
tears
,
"
God
's
will
be
done
,
my
dear
love
!
<EOS>
All
can
not
be
rich
and
happy
.
<EOS>
I
am
contented
,
and
had
rather
say
,
I
have
a
poor
honest
husband
,
than
a
guilty
rich
one
.
<EOS>
What
signifies
repining
:
let
the
world
go
as
it
will
,
we
shall
have
our
length
and
our
breadth
at
last
.
<EOS>
And
Providence
,
I
doubt
not
,
will
be
a
better
friend
to
our
good
girl
here
,
because
she
is
good
,
than
we
could
be
,
if
this
had
not
happened
,
"
pointing
to
me
,
who
,
then
about
eleven
years
old
(
for
it
was
before
my
lady
took
me
)
,
sat
weeping
in
the
chimney
corner
,
over
a
few
dying
embers
of
a
fire
,
at
their
moving
expressions
.
  
<EOS>
I
arose
,
and
kissing
both
their
hands
,
and
blessing
them
,
said
,
"
And
this
length
and
breadth
,
my
dear
parents
,
will
be
,
one
day
,
all
that
the
rich
and
the
great
can
possess
;
and
,
it
may
be
,
their
ungracious
heirs
will
trample
upon
their
ashes
,
and
rejoice
they
are
gone
:
while
such
a
poor
girl
as
I
,
am
honouring
the
memories
of
mine
,
who
,
in
their
good
names
,
and
good
lessons
,
will
have
left
me
the
best
of
portions
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
then
they
both
hugged
me
to
their
fond
bosoms
,
by
turns
;
and
all
three
were
filled
with
comfort
in
one
another
.
  
<EOS>
For
a
farther
proof
that
honest
poverty
is
not
such
a
deplorable
thing
as
some
people
imagine
,
let
me
ask
,
what
pleasure
can
those
over
-
happy
persons
know
,
who
,
from
the
luxury
of
their
tastes
,
and
their
affluent
circumstances
,
always
eat
before
they
are
hungry
,
and
drink
before
they
are
thirsty
?
<EOS>
This
may
be
illustrated
by
the
instance
of
a
certain
eastern
monarch
,
who
,
as
I
have
read
,
marching
at
the
head
of
a
vast
army
,
through
a
wide
extended
desert
,
which
afforded
neither
river
nor
spring
,
for
the
first
time
,
found
himself
(
in
common
with
his
soldiers
)
overtaken
by
a
craving
thirst
,
which
made
him
pant
after
a
cup
of
water
.
<EOS>
And
when
,
after
diligent
search
,
one
of
his
soldiers
found
a
little
dirty
puddle
,
and
carried
him
some
of
the
filthy
water
in
his
nasty
helmet
,
the
monarch
greedily
swallowing
it
,
cried
out
,
that
in
all
his
life
he
never
tasted
so
sweet
a
draught
!
  
<EOS>
But
when
I
talk
or
write
of
my
worthy
parents
,
how
I
run
on
!
 
<EOS>
Excuse
me
,
my
good
lady
,
and
do
n't
think
me
<EOS>
,
in
this
respect
,
too
much
like
the
cat
in
the
fable
,
turned
into
a
fine
lady
;
for
though
I
would
never
forget
what
I
was
,
yet
I
would
be
thought
to
know
how
gratefully
to
enjoy
my
present
happiness
,
as
well
with
regard
to
my
obligations
to
God
,
as
to
your
dear
brother
.
<EOS>
But
let
me
proceed
to
your
ladyship
's
third
particular
.
  
<EOS>
3
.
<EOS>
And
you
can
not
imagine
.
<EOS>
Madam
,
how
much
you
have
set
my
heart
at
rest
,
when
you
say
,
that
my
dear
Mr.
B.
gave
me
a
just
narrative
of
this
affair
with
Miss
Godfrey
:
for
when
your
ladyship
desired
to
know
how
he
had
recounted
that
story
,
lest
you
should
make
a
misunderstanding
between
us
unawares
,
I
knew
not
what
to
think
.
<EOS>
I
was
afraid
some
blood
had
been
shed
on
the
occasion
by
him
:
for
the
lady
was
ruined
,
and
as
to
her
,
nothing
could
have
happened
worse
.
<EOS>
The
regard
I
have
for
Mr.
B.
's
future
happiness
,
which
,
in
my
constant
supplication
for
him
in
private
,
costs
me
many
a
tear
,
gave
me
great
apprehensions
,
and
not
a
little
uneasiness
.
<EOS>
But
as
your
ladyship
tells
me
that
he
gave
me
a
just
account
,
I
am
happy
again
.
  
<EOS>
I
now
come
to
your
ladyship
's
fourth
particular
.
  
<EOS>
And
highly
delighted
I
am
for
having
obtained
your
approbation
of
my
conduct
to
the
child
,
as
well
as
of
my
behaviour
towards
the
dear
gentleman
,
on
the
unhappy
lady
's
score
.
<EOS>
Your
ladyship
's
wise
intimations
about
having
the
child
with
me
,
make
due
impressions
upon
me
;
and
I
see
in
them
,
with
grateful
pleasure
,
your
unmerited
regard
for
me
.
<EOS>
Yet
,
I
do
n't
know
how
it
is
,
but
I
have
conceived
a
strange
passion
for
this
dear
baby
;
I
can
not
but
look
upon
her
poor
mamma
as
my
sister
in
point
of
trial
;
and
shall
not
the
prosperous
sister
pity
and
love
the
poor
dear
sister
that
,
in
so
slippery
a
path
,
has
fallen
,
while
she
had
the
happiness
to
keep
her
feet
?
  
<EOS>
The
rest
of
your
ladyship
's
articles
give
me
the
greatest
pleasure
and
satisfaction
;
and
if
I
can
but
continue
myself
in
the
favour
of
your
dear
brother
,
and
improve
in
that
of
his
noble
sister
,
how
happy
shall
I
be
!
<EOS>
I
will
do
all
I
can
to
deserve
both
.
<EOS>
And
I
hope
you
will
take
as
an
instance
of
it
,
my
cheerful
obedience
to
your
commands
,
in
writing
to
so
fine
<EOS>
a
judge
,
such
crude
and
indigested
stuff
,
as
<EOS>
,
otherwise
I
ought
to
be
ashamed
to
lay
before
you
.
  
<EOS>
I
am
impatient
for
the
honour
of
your
presence
here
;
and
yet
I
perplex
myself
with
the
fear
of
appearing
so
unworthy
in
your
eye
when
near
you
,
as
to
suffer
in
your
opinion
;
but
I
promise
myself
,
that
however
this
may
be
the
case
on
your
first
visit
,
I
shall
be
so
much
improved
by
the
benefits
I
shall
reap
from
your
lessons
and
good
example
,
that
whenever
I
shall
be
favoured
with
a
second
you
shall
have
fewer
faults
to
find
with
me
;
till
,
as
I
shall
be
more
and
more
favoured
,
I
shall
in
time
be
just
what
your
ladyship
will
wish
me
to
be
,
and
,
of
consequence
,
more
worthy
than
I
am
of
the
honour
of
stiling
myself
your
ladyship
's
most
humble
and
obedient
servant
,

Darnford

,
  
<EOS>
You
are
highly
obliging
in
expressing
so
warmly
your
wishes
to
have
me
with
you
.
<EOS>
I
know
not
any
body
in
this
world
,
out
of
our
own
family
,
in
whose
company
I
should
be
happier
;
but
my
papa
wo
n't
part
with
me
,
I
think
;
though
I
have
secured
my
mamma
in
my
interest
;
and
I
know
Nancy
would
be
glad
of
my
absence
,
because
the
dear
,
perversely
envious
,
thinks
me
more
valued
than
she
is
;
and
yet
,
foolish
girl
,
she
do
n't
consider
,
that
if
her
envy
be
well
grounded
,
I
should
return
with
more
than
double
advantages
to
what
I
now
have
,
improved
by
your
charming
conversation
.
  
<EOS>
My
papa
affects
to
be
in
a
fearful
pet
,
at
your
lecturing
of
him
So
justly
;
for
my
mamma
would
show
him
the
letter
;
and
he
says
he
will
positively
demand
satisfaction
of
Mr.
B.
for
your
treating
him
so
freely
.
<EOS>
And
yet
he
shall
hardly
think
him
,
he
says
,
on
a
rank
with
him
,
unless
Mr.
B.
will
,
on
occasion
of
the
new
commission
,
take
out
his
Dedimus
:
and
then
if
he
will
bring
you
down
to
Lincolnshire
,
and
join
with
him
to
commit
you
prisoner
for
a
month
at
the
Hall
,
all
shall
be
well
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
very
obliging
in
Mr.
B.
to
join
in
your
kind
invitation
:
<EOS>
but
 
yet
I
am
loth
to
say
it
to
you
 
the
character
of
your
worthy
gentleman
<EOS>
,
I
doubt
,
stands
a
little
in
the
way
with
my
papa
.
  
<EOS>
My
mamma
pleaded
his
being
married
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ads
-
dines
,
Madam
,
"
said
he
,
"
what
of
all
that
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
Sir
,
"
said
I
,
"
I
hope
,
if
I
may
not
go
to
Bedfordshire
,
you
'll
permit
me
to
go
to
London
,
when
Mrs.
B.
goes
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
he
,
"
<EOS>
positively
no
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Sir
,
I
have
done
.
<EOS>
I
could
hope
,
however
,
you
would
enable
me
to
give
a
better
reason
to
good
Mrs.
B.
why
I
am
not
permitted
to
accept
of
the
kind
invitation
,
than
that
<EOS>
which
I
understand
you
have
been
pleased
to
assign
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
stuck
his
hands
in
his
sides
,
with
his
usual
humourous
positiveness
.
<EOS>
"
Why
,
then
tell
her
she
is
a
very
saucy
lady
,
for
her
last
letter
to
you
,
and
her
lord
and
master
is
not
to
be
trusted
;
and
it
is
my
absolute
will
and
pleasure
that
you
ask
me
no
more
questions
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
very
faithfully
make
this
report
,
Sir
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Do
so
.
"
<EOS>
And
so
I
have
.
<EOS>
And
your
poor
Polly
Darnford
is
disappointed
of
one
of
the
greatest
pleasures
she
could
have
had
.
  
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
help
it
 
if
you
truly
pity
me
<EOS>
you
can
make
me
easier
under
the
disappointment
,
than
otherwise
possible
,
by
favouring
me
with
an
epistolary
conversation
,
since
I
am
denied
a
personal
one
;
and
<EOS>
my
mamma
joins
in
the
request
;
particularly
let
us
know
how
Lady
Davers
's
first
visit
passes
;
which
Mrs.
Peters
and
Mrs.
Jones
,
who
know
my
lady
<EOS>
so
well
,
likewise
long
to
hear
.
<EOS>
And
this
will
make
us
the
best
amends
in
your
power
for
the
loss
of
your
good
neighbourhood
,
which
we
had
all
promised
to
ourselves
.
  
<EOS>
This
denial
of
my
papa
comes
out
,
since
I
wrote
the
above
,
to
be
principally
owing
to
a
proposal
made
him
of
an
humble
servant
to
one
of
his
daughters
:
he
wo
n't
say
which
,
he
tells
us
,
in
his
usual
humourous
way
,
lest
we
should
fall
out
about
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
,
"
I
tell
him
,
"
the
young
gentleman
is
to
pick
and
choose
which
of
the
two
he
likes
best
.
"
But
be
he
a
duke
,
'
tis
all
one
to
Polly
,
if
he
is
not
something
above
our
common
Lincolnshire
class
of
fox
-
hunters
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
shewn
<EOS>
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Peters
your
letter
.
<EOS>
They
admire
you
beyond
expression
;
and
Mr.
Peters
says
,
he
does
not
know
,
that
ever
he
did
any
thing
in
his
life
,
that
gave
him
so
much
inward
reproach
,
as
his
denying
you
the
protection
of
his
family
,
which
Mr.
Williams
sought
to
move
him
to
afford
you
,
when
you
were
confined
at
the
Hall
,
before
Mr.
B.
came
down
to
you
,
with
his
heart
bent
on
mischief
;
and
all
he
comforts
himself
with
is
,
that
very
denial
,
as
well
as
the
other
hardships
you
have
met
with
,
were
necessary
to
bring
about
that
work
of
Providence
which
was
to
reward
your
unexampled
virtue
.
  
<EOS>
Yet
,
he
says
,
he
doubts
he
shall
not
be
thought
excusable
by
you
,
who
are
so
exact
in
your
own
duty
,
<EOS>
since
he
had
the
unhappiness
to
lose
such
an
opportunity
to
have
done
honour
to
his
function
,
had
he
had
the
fortitude
to
have
done
his
;
and
he
has
begged
of
me
to
hint
his
concern
to
you
on
this
head
;
and
to
express
his
hopes
,
that
neither
religion
nor
his
cloth
may
suffer
in
your
opinion
,
for
the
fault
of
one
of
its
professors
,
who
never
was
wanting
in
his
duty
so
much
before
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
it
often
upon
his
mind
,
he
says
,
to
write
to
you
on
this
very
subject
;
but
he
had
not
the
courage
;
and
besides
,
did
not
know
how
Mr.
B.
might
take
it
,
if
he
should
see
that
letter
,
as
the
case
had
such
delicate
circumstances
in
it
,
that
in
blaming
himself
,
as
he
should
very
freely
have
done
,
he
must
,
by
implication
,
have
cast
still
greater
blame
upon
him
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Peters
is
certainly
a
very
good
man
,
and
my
favourite
for
that
reason
;
and
I
hope
you
,
who
could
so
easily
forgive
the
late
wicked
,
but
now
penitent
Jewkes
,
will
overlook
with
kindness
a
fault
in
a
good
man
,
which
proceeded
more
from
pusillanimity
and
constitution
,
than
from
want
of
principle
:
for
once
,
talking
of
it
to
my
mamma
,
before
me
,
he
accused
himself
on
this
score
,
to
her
,
with
tears
in
his
eyes
.
<EOS>
She
,
good
lady
,
would
have
given
you
this
protection
at
Mr.
Williams
's
desire
;
but
wanted
the
power
to
do
it
.
  
<EOS>
So
you
see
,
my
dear
Mrs.
B.
,
how
your
virtue
has
shamed
every
one
into
such
a
sense
of
what
they
ought
to
have
done
,
that
good
,
bad
,
and
indifferent
,
are
seeking
to
make
excuses
for
past
misbehaviour
,
and
to
promise
future
amendment
,
like
penitent
subjects
returning
to
their
duty
to
their
conquering
sovereign
,
after
some
unworthy
defection
.
  
<EOS>
Happy
,
happy
lady
!
<EOS>
May
you
ever
be
so
!
<EOS>
May
you
always
convert
your
enemies
,
invigorate
the
lukewarm
,
and
every
day
multiply
your
friends
,
wishes
your
most
affectionate
,
  
POLLY
DARNFORD
.
  
<EOS>
P.S.
<EOS>
How
I
rejoice
in
the
joy
of
your
honest
parents
!
<EOS>
God
bless
'em
!
<EOS>
I
am
glad
<EOS>
Lady
Davers
is
so
wise
.
<EOS>
Every
one
I
have
named
desire
their
best
respects
.
<EOS>
Write
oftener
,
and
omit
not
the
minutest
thing
:
for
every
line
of
yours
carries
instruction
with
it
.
    
<EOS>
From
Sir
Simon
Darnford
to
Mr.
B.
  
SIR
,
  
Little
did
I
think
I
should
ever
have
occasion
to
make
a
formal
complaint
against
a
person
very
dear
to
you
,
and
who
I
believe
deserves
to
be
so
;
but
do
n't
let
her
be
so
proud
and
so
vain
of
obliging
and
pleasing
you
,
as
to
make
her
not
care
how
she
affronts
every
body
else
.
  
<EOS>
The
person
is
no
other
than
the
wife
of
your
bosom
,
who
has
taken
such
liberties
with
me
as
ought
not
to
be
taken
,
and
sought
to
turn
my
own
child
against
me
,
and
make
a
dutiful
girl
a
rebel
.
  
<EOS>
If
people
will
set
up
for
virtue
,
and
all
that
,
let
'em
be
uniformly
virtuous
,
or
I
would
not
give
a
farthing
for
their
pretences
.
  
<EOS>
Here
I
have
been
plagued
with
gouts
,
rheumatisms
,
and
nameless
disorders
,
ever
since
you
left
us
,
which
have
made
me
call
for
a
little
more
attendance
than
ordinary
;
and
I
had
reason
to
think
myself
slighted
,
where
an
indulgent
father
can
least
bear
to
be
so
,
that
is
,
where
he
most
loves
;
and
that
by
young
upstarts
,
who
are
growing
up
to
the
enjoyment
of
those
pleasures
which
have
run
away
from
me
,
fleeting
rascals
as
they
are
!
<EOS>
before
I
was
willing
to
part
with
them
.
<EOS>
And
I
rung
and
rung
,
and
<EOS>
"
Where
's
Polly
?
"
<EOS>
(
for
I
honour
the
slut
with
too
much
of
my
notice
)
,
"
Where
's
Polly
?
<EOS>
"
was
all
my
cry
,
to
every
one
who
came
up
to
ask
what
I
rung
for
.
<EOS>
And
,
at
last
,
in
burst
the
pert
baggage
,
with
an
air
of
assurance
,
as
if
she
thought
all
must
be
well
the
moment
she
appeared
,
with
"
Do
you
want
me
,
papa
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
I
want
you
,
Confidence
?
<EOS>
Yes
,
I
do
.
<EOS>
Where
have
you
been
these
two
hours
,
that
you
never
came
near
me
,
when
you
knew
'
twas
my
time
to
have
my
foot
rubbed
,
which
gives
me
mortal
pain
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
For
you
must
understand
,
Mr.
B.
,
that
nobody
's
hand
's
so
soft
as
Polly
's
.
  
<EOS>
She
gave
me
a
saucy
answer
,
as
I
was
disposed
to
think
it
,
because
I
had
just
then
a
twinge
,
that
I
could
scarce
bear
;
for
pain
is
a
plaguy
thing
to
a
man
of
my
lively
spirits
.
  
<EOS>
She
gave
me
,
I
say
,
a
careless
answer
,
and
turning
upon
her
heel
;
and
not
coming
to
me
at
my
first
word
,
I
flung
a
book
which
I
had
in
my
hand
,
at
her
head
.
<EOS>
And
,
this
fine
lady
of
your
's
,
this
paragon
of
meekness
and
humility
,
in
so
many
words
,
bids
me
,
or
,
which
is
worse
,
tells
my
own
daughter
to
bid
me
,
never
to
take
a
book
into
my
hands
again
,
if
I
wo
n't
make
a
better
use
of
it
:
 
and
yet
,
what
better
use
can
an
offended
father
make
of
the
best
books
,
than
to
correct
a
rebellious
child
with
them
,
and
oblige
a
saucy
daughter
to
jump
into
her
duty
all
at
once
?
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
B.
reflects
upon
me
for
making
her
blush
formerly
,
and
saying
things
before
my
daughters
,
that
,
truly
,
I
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
?
<EOS>
then
avows
malice
and
revenge
.
<EOS>
Why
neighbour
,
are
these
things
to
be
borne
?
 
<EOS>
Do
you
allow
your
lady
to
set
up
for
a
general
corrector
of
every
body
's
morals
but
your
own
?
 
<EOS>
Do
you
allow
her
to
condemn
the
only
instances
of
wit
that
remain
to
this
generation
;
that
dear
polite
double
entendre
,
which
keeps
alive
the
attention
,
and
quickens
the
apprehension
,
of
the
best
companies
in
the
world
,
and
is
the
salt
,
the
sauce
,
which
gives
a
poignancy
to
all
our
genteeler
entertainments
!
  
<EOS>
Very
fine
,
truly
!
<EOS>
that
more
than
half
the
world
shall
be
shut
out
of
society
,
shall
be
precluded
their
share
of
conversation
amongst
the
gay
and
polite
of
both
sexes
,
were
your
lady
to
have
her
will
!
<EOS>
Let
her
first
find
people
who
can
support
a
conversation
with
wit
and
good
sense
like
her
own
,
and
then
something
may
be
said
:
<EOS>
but
till
then
,
I
positively
say
,
and
will
swear
upon
occasion
,
that
double
entendre
shall
not
be
banished
from
our
tables
;
and
where
this
wo
n't
raise
a
blush
,
or
create
a
laugh
,
we
will
,
if
we
please
,
for
all
Mrs.
B.
and
her
new
-
fangled
notions
,
force
the
one
and
the
other
by
still
plainer
hints
;
and
let
her
help
herself
how
she
can
.
  
<EOS>
Thus
,
Sir
,
you
find
my
complaints
are
of
a
high
nature
,
regarding
the
quiet
of
a
family
,
the
duty
of
a
child
to
a
parent
,
and
the
freedom
and
politeness
of
conversation
;
in
all
which
your
lady
has
greatly
offended
;
and
I
insist
upon
satisfaction
from
you
,
or
such
a
correction
of
the
fair
transgressor
,
as
is
in
your
power
to
inflict
,
and
which
may
prevent
worse
consequences
from
your
offended
friend
and
servant
,
  
SIMON
DARNFORD
.
    
<EOS>
From
Mr.
B.
in
Answer
to
the
preceding
one
.
  
<EOS>
DEAR
SIR
SIMON
,
  
<EOS>
You
can
not
but
believe
that
I
was
much
surprised
at
your
letter
,
complaining
of
the
behaviour
of
my
wife
.
<EOS>
I
could
no
more
have
expected
such
a
complaint
from
such
a
gentleman
,
than
I
could
,
that
she
would
have
deserved
it
:
and
I
am
very
sorry
on
both
accounts
.
<EOS>
I
have
talked
to
her
in
such
a
manner
,
that
,
I
dare
say
,
she
will
never
give
you
like
cause
to
appeal
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
It
happened
,
that
the
criminal
herself
received
it
from
her
servant
,
and
brought
it
to
me
in
my
closet
;
and
,
making
her
honours
(
for
I
ca
n't
say
<EOS>
but
she
is
very
obliging
to
me
,
though
she
takes
such
saucy
freedoms
with
my
friends
)
away
she
tript
;
and
<EOS>
I
,
inquiring
for
her
,
when
,
with
surprise
,
as
you
may
believe
,
I
had
read
your
charge
,
found
she
was
gone
to
visit
a
poor
sick
neighbour
;
of
which
indeed
I
knew
before
because
she
took
the
chariot
;
but
I
had
forgot
it
in
my
wrath
.
  
<EOS>
At
last
,
in
she
came
,
with
that
sweet
composure
in
her
face
which
results
from
a
consciousness
of
doing
generally
just
and
generous
things
.
<EOS>
I
resumed
,
therefore
,
that
sternness
and
displeasure
which
her
entrance
had
almost
dissipated
.
<EOS>
I
took
her
hand
;
her
charming
eye
(
you
know
what
an
eye
she
has
,
Sir
Simon
)
quivered
at
my
overclouded
aspect
;
and
her
lips
,
half
drawn
to
a
smile
,
trembling
with
apprehension
of
a
countenance
so
changed
from
what
she
left
it
.
  
<EOS>
And
then
,
all
stiff
and
stately
as
I
could
look
,
did
I
accost
her
 
<EOS>
"
Come
along
with
me
,
Pamela
,
to
my
closet
.
<EOS>
I
want
to
talk
with
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
have
I
done
?
<EOS>
Let
me
know
,
good
Sir
!
"
<EOS>
looking
round
,
with
her
half
-
affrighted
eyes
,
this
way
and
that
,
on
the
books
,
and
pictures
,
and
on
me
,
by
turns
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
shall
know
soon
,
"
said
I
,
"
the
crime
you
have
been
guilty
of
.
<EOS>
"
 
"
Crime
,
Sir
!
<EOS>
Pray
let
me
 
<EOS>
This
closet
,
I
hoped
,
would
not
be
a
second
time
witness
to
the
flutter
you
put
me
in
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
hangs
a
tale
,
Sir
Simon
,
which
I
am
not
very
fond
of
relating
,
since
it
gave
beginning
to
the
triumphs
of
this
little
sorceress
.
<EOS>
I
still
held
one
hand
,
and
she
stood
before
me
,
as
criminals
ought
to
do
before
their
judge
,
but
said
,
"
I
see
,
Sir
,
sure
I
do
,
 
or
what
will
else
become
of
me
!
 
<EOS>
less
severity
in
your
eyes
,
than
you
affect
to
put
on
in
your
countenance
.
<EOS>
Dear
Sir
,
let
me
but
know
my
fault
:
I
will
repent
,
acknowledge
,
and
amend
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
have
great
presence
of
mind
,
Pamela
,
<EOS>
such
is
the
nature
of
your
fault
,
if
you
can
look
me
in
the
face
,
when
I
tell
it
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
let
me
,
"
said
the
irresistible
charmer
,
hiding
her
face
in
my
bosom
,
and
putting
her
other
arm
about
my
neck
,
"
let
me
thus
,
my
dear
Mr.
B.
,
hide
this
guilty
face
,
while
I
hear
my
fault
told
;
and
I
will
not
seek
to
extenuate
it
,
by
my
tears
,
and
my
penitence
.
<EOS>
"
  
I
could
hardly
hold
out
.
<EOS>
What
infatuating
creatures
are
these
women
,
when
they
thus
soothe
and
calm
the
tumults
of
an
angry
heart
!
<EOS>
When
,
instead
of
scornful
looks
darted
in
return
for
angry
ones
,
words
of
defiance
for
words
of
peevishness
,
persisting
to
defend
one
error
by
another
,
and
returning
vehement
wrath
for
slight
indignation
,
and
all
the
hostile
provocations
of
the
marriage
warfare
;
they
can
thus
hide
their
dear
faces
in
our
bosoms
,
and
wish
but
to
know
their
faults
,
to
amend
them
!
  
<EOS>
I
could
hardly
,
I
say
,
resist
the
sweet
girl
's
behaviour
;
<EOS>
nay
,
I
believe
,
I
did
,
and
in
defiance
to
my
resolved
displeasure
,
press
her
forehead
with
my
lips
,
as
the
rest
of
her
face
was
hid
on
my
breast
;
but
,
considering
it
was
the
cause
of
my
friend
,
I
was
to
assert
,
my
injured
friend
,
wounded
and
insulted
,
in
so
various
a
manner
by
the
fair
offender
,
thus
haughtily
spoke
I
to
the
trembling
mischief
,
in
a
pomp
of
style
theatrically
tragic
:
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
,
too
inadvertent
,
and
undistinguishing
Pamela
,
keep
you
long
in
suspense
,
for
the
sake
of
a
circumstance
,
that
,
on
this
occasion
,
ought
to
give
you
as
much
joy
,
as
it
has
,
till
now
,
given
me
 
since
it
becomes
an
advocate
in
your
favour
,
when
otherwise
you
might
expect
very
severe
treatment
.
<EOS>
Know
then
,
that
the
letter
you
gave
me
before
you
went
out
,
is
a
letter
from
a
friend
,
a
neighbour
,
a
worthy
neighbour
,
complaining
of
your
behaviour
to
him
;
 
no
other
than
Sir
Simon
Darnford
"
<EOS>
(
for
I
would
not
amuse
her
too
much
)
,
"
a
gentleman
I
must
always
respect
,
and
whom
,
as
my
friend
,
I
expected
you
should
:
since
,
by
the
value
a
wife
expresses
for
one
esteemed
by
her
husband
,
whether
she
thinks
so
well
of
him
herself
,
or
not
,
a
man
ought
always
to
judge
of
the
sincerity
of
her
regards
to
himself
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
raised
her
head
at
once
on
this
:
 
"
Thank
Heaven
,
"
said
she
,
"
it
is
no
worse
!
 
<EOS>
I
was
at
my
wit
's
end
almost
,
in
apprehension
:
<EOS>
but
I
know
how
this
must
be
.
<EOS>
Dear
Sir
,
how
could
you
frighten
me
so
?
 
<EOS>
I
know
how
all
this
is
!
 
<EOS>
I
can
now
look
you
in
the
face
,
and
hear
all
that
Sir
Simon
can
charge
me
with
!
<EOS>
For
I
am
sure
,
I
have
not
so
affronted
him
as
to
make
him
angry
indeed
.
<EOS>
And
truly
"
(
ran
she
on
,
secure
of
pardon
as
she
seemed
to
think
)
,
"
I
should
respect
Sir
Simon
not
only
as
your
friend
,
but
on
his
own
account
,
if
he
was
not
so
sad
a
rake
at
a
time
of
life
"
  
Then
I
interrupted
her
,
you
must
needs
think
.
<EOS>
Sir
Simon
;
for
how
could
I
bear
to
hear
my
worthy
friend
so
freely
treated
!
<EOS>
"
How
now
,
Pamela
!
<EOS>
"
said
I
;
"
and
is
it
thus
,
by
repeating
your
fault
,
that
you
atone
for
it
?
<EOS>
Do
you
think
I
can
bear
to
hear
my
friend
so
freely
treated
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
,
"
said
she
,
"
I
do
respect
Sir
Simon
very
much
as
your
friend
,
permit
me
to
repeat
;
but
can
not
for
his
wilful
failings
.
<EOS>
Would
it
not
be
,
in
some
measure
,
to
approve
of
faulty
conversation
,
if
one
can
hear
it
,
and
not
discourage
it
,
when
the
occasion
comes
in
<EOS>
so
pat
?
 
<EOS>
And
,
indeed
,
I
was
glad
of
an
opportunity
,
"
continued
she
,
"
to
give
him
a
little
rub
;
I
must
needs
own
it
:
but
if
it
displeases
you
,
or
has
made
him
angry
in
earnest
,
I
am
sorry
for
it
,
and
will
be
less
bold
for
the
future
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Read
then
,
"
said
I
,
"
the
heavy
charge
,
and
I
'll
return
instantly
to
hear
your
answer
to
it
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
So
I
went
from
her
,
for
a
few
minutes
.
<EOS>
But
,
would
you
believe
it
,
Sir
Simon
?
<EOS>
she
seemed
,
on
my
return
,
very
little
concerned
at
your
just
complaints
.
<EOS>
What
self
-
justifying
minds
have
the
meekest
of
these
women
!
 
<EOS>
Instead
of
finding
her
in
repentant
tears
,
as
one
would
expect
,
she
took
your
angry
letter
for
a
jocular
one
;
and
I
had
great
difficulty
to
convince
her
of
the
heinousness
of
her
fault
,
or
the
reality
of
your
resentment
.
<EOS>
Upon
which
,
being
determined
to
have
justice
done
to
my
friend
,
and
a
due
sense
of
her
own
great
error
impressed
upon
her
,
I
began
thus
:
  
"
Pamela
,
take
heed
that
you
do
not
suffer
the
purity
of
your
own
mind
,
in
breach
of
your
charity
,
to
make
you
too
rigorous
a
censurer
of
other
people
's
actions
:
do
n't
be
so
puffed
up
with
your
own
perfections
,
as
to
imagine
,
that
,
because
other
persons
allow
themselves
liberties
you
can
not
take
,
therefore
they
must
be
wicked
.
<EOS>
Sir
Simon
is
a
gentleman
who
indulges
himself
in
a
pleasant
vein
,
and
,
I
believe
,
as
well
as
you
,
has
been
a
great
rake
and
libertine
:
"
<EOS>
(
You
'll
excuse
me
,
Sir
Simon
,
because
I
am
taking
your
part
)
,
"
but
what
then
?
<EOS>
You
see
it
is
all
over
with
him
now
.
<EOS>
He
says
,
that
he
must
,
and
therefore
he
will
be
virtuous
:
and
is
a
man
for
ever
to
hear
the
faults
of
his
youth
,
when
so
willing
to
forget
them
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
but
,
Sir
,
Sir
,
"
said
the
bold
slut
,
"
can
you
say
he
is
willing
to
forget
them
?
 
<EOS>
Does
he
not
repine
in
this
very
letter
,
that
he
must
forsake
them
;
and
does
he
not
plainly
cherish
the
inclination
,
when
he
owns
<EOS>
"
She
hesitated
 
<EOS>
"
Owns
what
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
know
what
I
mean
.
<EOS>
Sir
,
and
I
need
not
speak
it
:
and
can
there
well
be
a
more
censurable
character
?
 
<EOS>
Then
before
his
maiden
daughters
!
<EOS>
his
virtuous
lady
!
<EOS>
before
any
body
!
 
<EOS>
What
a
sad
thing
is
this
,
at
a
time
of
life
,
which
should
afford
a
better
example
!
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
dear
Sir
,
"
continued
the
bold
prattler
,
(
taking
advantage
of
a
silence
more
owing
to
displeasure
than
approbation
)
"
let
me
,
for
I
would
not
be
too
censorious
"
<EOS>
(
No
,
not
she
!
<EOS>
in
the
very
act
of
censoriousness
to
say
this
!
)
,
"
let
me
offer
but
<EOS>
one
thing
:
do
n't
you
think
Sir
Simon
himself
would
be
loth
to
be
thought
a
reformed
gentleman
?
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
see
his
delight
,
when
speaking
of
his
former
pranks
,
as
if
sorry
he
could
not
play
them
over
again
?
<EOS>
See
but
how
he
simpers
,
and
enjoys
,
as
one
may
say
,
the
relations
of
his
own
rakish
actions
,
when
he
tells
a
bad
story
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
"
said
I
,
"
were
this
the
case
"
(
for
I
profess
,
<EOS>
Sir
Simon
,
I
was
at
a
grievous
loss
to
defend
you
)
,
"
for
you
to
write
all
these
free
things
against
a
father
to
his
daughter
,
is
that
right
,
Pamela
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
O
,
Sir
!
<EOS>
the
good
gentleman
himself
has
taken
care
,
that
such
a
character
as
I
presumed
to
draw
to
Miss
of
her
papa
,
was
no
strange
one
to
her
.
<EOS>
You
have
seen
yourself
,
Mr.
B.
,
whenever
his
arch
leers
,
and
his
humourous
attitude
on
those
occasions
,
have
taught
us
to
expect
some
shocking
story
,
how
his
lady
and
daughters
(
used
to
him
as
they
are
)
,
have
suffered
in
their
apprehensions
of
what
he
would
say
,
before
he
spoke
it
:
<EOS>
how
,
particularly
,
dear
Miss
Darnford
has
looked
at
me
with
concern
,
desirous
,
as
it
were
,
if
possible
,
to
save
her
papa
from
the
censure
,
which
his
faulty
expressions
must
naturally
bring
upon
him
.
<EOS>
And
,
dear
Sir
,
is
it
not
a
sad
thing
for
a
young
lady
,
who
loves
and
honours
her
papa
,
to
observe
,
that
he
is
discrediting
himself
,
and
wants
the
example
he
ought
to
give
?
<EOS>
And
pardon
me
,
Sir
,
for
smiling
on
so
serious
an
occasion
;
but
is
it
not
a
fine
sight
to
see
a
gentleman
,
as
we
have
often
seen
Sir
Simon
,
when
he
has
thought
proper
to
read
a
passage
in
some
bad
book
,
pulling
off
his
spectacles
,
to
talk
filthily
upon
it
?
<EOS>
Methinks
<EOS>
I
see
him
now
,
"
added
the
bold
slut
,
"
splitting
his
arch
face
with
a
broad
laugh
,
shewing
a
mouth
,
with
hardly
a
tooth
in
it
,
and
making
obscene
remarks
upon
what
he
has
read
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
then
the
dear
saucy
-
face
laughed
out
,
to
bear
me
company
;
for
I
could
not
,
for
the
soul
of
me
,
avoid
laughing
heartily
at
the
figure
she
brought
to
my
mind
,
which
I
have
seen
my
old
friend
more
than
once
make
,
with
his
dismounted
spectacles
,
arch
mouth
,
and
gums
of
shining
jet
,
succeeding
those
of
polished
ivory
,
of
which
he
often
boasts
,
as
one
ornament
of
his
youthful
days
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
the
rather
in
my
heart
,
Sir
Simon
,
gave
you
up
,
because
,
when
I
was
a
sad
fellow
,
it
was
always
my
maxim
to
endeavour
to
touch
a
lady
's
heart
without
wounding
her
ears
.
<EOS>
And
,
indeed
,
I
found
my
account
sometimes
in
observing
it
.
<EOS>
But
,
resuming
my
gravity
 
<EOS>
"
Hussy
<EOS>
,
said
I
,
do
you
think
I
will
have
my
old
friend
thus
made
the
object
of
your
ridicule
?
 
<EOS>
Suppose
a
challenge
should
have
ensued
between
us
on
your
account
 
<EOS>
what
might
have
been
the
issue
of
it
?
<EOS>
To
see
an
old
gentleman
,
stumping
,
as
he
says
,
on
crutches
,
to
fight
a
duel
in
defence
of
his
wounded
honour
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Very
bad
,
Sir
,
to
be
sure
:
I
see
that
,
and
am
sorry
for
it
:
for
had
you
carried
off
Sir
Simon
's
crutch
,
as
a
trophy
,
he
must
have
lain
sighing
and
groaning
like
a
wounded
soldier
in
the
field
of
battle
,
till
another
had
been
brought
him
,
to
have
stumped
home
with
.
"
  
<EOS>
But
,
dear
Sir
Simon
,
I
have
brought
this
matter
to
an
issue
,
that
will
,
I
hope
,
make
all
easy
;
 
Miss
Polly
,
and
my
Pamela
,
shall
both
be
punished
as
they
deserve
,
if
it
be
not
your
own
fault
.
<EOS>
I
am
told
,
that
the
sins
of
your
youth
do
n't
sit
so
heavily
upon
your
limbs
,
as
in
your
imagination
;
and
I
believe
change
of
air
,
and
the
gratification
of
your
revenge
,
a
fine
help
to
such
lively
spirits
as
yours
,
will
set
you
up
.
<EOS>
You
shall
then
take
coach
,
and
bring
your
pretty
criminal
to
mine
;
and
when
we
have
them
together
,
they
shall
humble
themselves
before
us
,
and
you
can
absolve
or
punish
them
,
as
you
shall
see
proper
.
<EOS>
For
I
can
not
bear
to
have
my
worthy
friend
insulted
in
so
heinous
a
manner
,
by
a
couple
of
saucy
girls
,
who
,
if
not
taken
down
in
time
,
may
proceed
from
fault
to
fault
,
till
there
will
be
no
living
with
them
.
  
<EOS>
If
(
to
be
still
more
serious
)
<EOS>
your
lady
and
you
will
lend
Miss
Darnford
to
my
Pamela
's
wishes
,
whose
heart
is
set
upon
the
hope
of
her
wintering
with
us
in
town
,
you
will
lay
an
obligation
upon
us
both
;
which
will
be
acknowledged
with
great
gratitude
by
,
<EOS>
dear
Sir
,
your
affectionate
and
humble
servant
.
    
<EOS>
From
Sir
Simon
Darnford
in
reply
.
  
<EOS>
Hark
ye
,
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
 
A
word
in
your
ear
:
 
to
be
plain
:
I
like
neither
you
nor
your
wife
well
enough
to
trust
my
Polly
with
you
.
  
<EOS>
But
here
's
<EOS>
war
declared
against
my
poor
gums
,
it
seems
.
<EOS>
Well
,
I
will
never
open
my
mouth
before
your
lady
as
long
as
I
live
,
if
I
can
help
it
.
<EOS>
I
have
for
these
ten
years
avoided
to
put
on
my
cravat
;
and
for
what
reason
,
do
you
think
?
 
<EOS>
Why
,
because
I
could
not
bear
to
see
what
ruins
a
few
years
have
made
in
a
visage
,
that
used
to
inspire
love
and
terror
as
it
pleased
.
<EOS>
And
here
your
 
what
<EOS>
-
shall
-
I
-
call
-
her
of
a
wife
,
with
all
the
insolence
of
youth
and
beauty
on
her
side
,
follows
me
with
a
glass
,
and
would
make
me
look
in
it
,
whether
I
will
or
not
.
<EOS>
I
'm
a
plaguy
<EOS>
good
-
humoured
old
fellow
 
<EOS>
if
I
am
an
old
fellow
 
<EOS>
or
I
should
not
bear
the
insults
contained
in
your
letter
.
<EOS>
Between
you
and
your
lady
,
you
make
a
wretched
figure
of
me
,
that
's
certain
.
 
<EOS>
And
yet
'
tis
taking
my
part
.
  
<EOS>
But
what
must
I
do
?
 
<EOS>
I
'd
be
glad
at
any
rate
to
stand
in
your
lady
's
graces
,
that
I
would
;
nor
would
I
be
the
last
rake
libertine
unreformed
by
her
example
,
which
I
suppose
will
make
virtue
the
fashion
,
if
she
goes
on
as
she
does
.
<EOS>
But
here
I
have
been
used
to
cut
a
joke
and
toss
the
squib
about
;
and
,
as
far
as
I
know
,
it
has
helped
to
keep
me
alive
in
the
midst
of
pains
and
aches
,
and
with
two
women
-
grown
girls
,
and
the
rest
of
the
mortifications
that
will
attend
on
advanced
years
;
for
I
wo
n't
(
hang
me
if
I
will
)
give
it
up
as
absolute
old
age
!
  
<EOS>
But
now
,
it
seems
,
I
must
leave
all
this
off
,
or
I
must
be
mortified
with
a
looking
glass
held
before
me
,
and
every
wrinkle
must
be
made
as
conspicuous
as
a
furrow
 
<EOS>
And
what
,
pray
,
is
to
succeed
to
this
reformation
?
 
<EOS>
I
can
neither
fast
nor
pray
<EOS>
,
I
doubt
.
 
<EOS>
And
besides
,
if
my
stomach
and
my
jest
depart
from
me
,
farewell
,
Sir
Simon
Darnford
!
  
<EOS>
But
can
not
I
pass
as
one
necessary
character
,
do
you
think
:
<EOS>
as
a
foil
(
as
,
by
-
the
-
bye
,
some
of
your
own
actions
have
been
to
your
lady
's
virtue
)
to
set
off
some
more
edifying
example
,
where
variety
of
characters
make
up
a
feast
in
conversation
?
  
<EOS>
Well
,
I
believe
I
might
have
trusted
you
with
my
daughter
,
under
your
lady
's
eye
,
rake
as
you
have
been
yourself
;
and
fame
says
wrong
,
if
you
have
not
been
,
for
your
time
a
bolder
sinner
than
ever
I
was
,
with
your
maxim
of
touching
ladies
'
hearts
,
without
wounding
their
ears
,
which
made
surer
work
with
them
,
that
was
all
;
though
'
tis
to
be
hoped
you
are
now
reformed
;
and
if
you
are
,
the
whole
country
round
you
,
east
,
west
,
north
,
and
south
,
owe
great
obligations
to
your
fair
reclaimer
.
<EOS>
But
here
is
a
fine
prim
young
fellow
,
coming
out
of
Norfolk
,
with
one
estate
in
one
county
,
another
in
another
,
and
jointures
and
settlements
in
his
hand
,
and
more
wit
in
his
head
,
as
well
as
more
money
in
his
pocket
,
than
he
can
tell
what
to
do
with
,
to
visit
our
Polly
;
though
I
tell
her
I
much
question
the
former
quality
,
his
wit
,
if
he
is
for
marrying
.
  
<EOS>
Here
then
is
the
reason
I
can
not
comply
with
your
kind
Mrs.
B.
's
request
.
<EOS>
But
if
this
matter
should
go
off
;
if
he
should
not
like
her
,
or
she
him
;
or
if
I
should
not
like
his
terms
,
or
he
mine
;
 
or
still
another
<EOS>
or
,
if
he
should
like
Nancy
better
why
,
then
perhaps
,
if
Polly
be
a
good
girl
,
I
may
trust
to
her
virtue
,
and
to
your
honour
,
and
let
her
go
for
a
month
or
two
.
  
<EOS>
Now
,
when
I
have
said
this
,
and
when
I
say
,
further
,
that
I
can
forgive
your
severe
lady
,
and
yourself
too
,
(
who
,
however
,
are
less
to
be
excused
in
the
airs
you
assume
,
which
looks
like
one
chimney
-
sweeper
calling
another
a
sooty
rascal
)
<EOS>
I
gave
a
proof
of
my
charity
,
which
I
hope
with
Mrs.
B.
will
cover
a
multitude
of
faults
;
and
the
rather
,
since
,
though
I
can
not
be
a
follower
of
her
virtue
in
the
strictest
sense
,
I
can
be
an
admirer
of
it
;
and
that
is
some
little
merit
:
and
indeed
all
that
can
be
at
present
pleaded
by
yourself
,
I
doubt
,
any
more
than
your
humble
servant
,
  
SIMON
DARNFORD
.
    
<EOS>
MY
HONOURED
AND
DEAR
PARENTS
<EOS>
,
  
I
hope
you
will
excuse
my
long
silence
,
which
has
been
owing
to
several
causes
,
and
having
had
nothing
new
to
entertain
you
with
:
and
yet
this
last
is
but
a
poor
excuse
to
you
,
who
think
every
trifling
subject
agreeable
from
your
daughter
.
  
<EOS>
I
daily
expect
here
my
Lord
and
Lady
Davers
.
<EOS>
This
gives
me
no
small
pleasure
,
and
yet
it
is
mingled
with
some
uneasiness
at
times
;
lest
I
should
not
,
when
viewed
so
intimately
near
,
behave
myself
answerably
to
her
ladyship
's
expectations
.
<EOS>
But
I
resolve
not
to
endeavour
to
move
out
of
the
sphere
of
my
own
capacity
,
in
order
to
emulate
her
ladyship
.
<EOS>
She
must
have
advantages
,
by
conversation
,
as
well
as
education
,
which
it
would
be
arrogance
in
me
to
assume
,
or
to
think
of
imitating
.
  
<EOS>
All
that
I
will
attempt
to
do
,
therefore
,
shall
be
,
to
shew
such
a
respectful
obligingness
to
my
lady
,
as
shall
be
consistent
with
the
condition
to
which
I
am
raised
;
so
that
she
may
not
have
reason
to
reproach
me
of
pride
in
my
exaltation
,
nor
her
dear
brother
to
rebuke
me
for
meanness
in
condescending
:
and
,
as
to
my
family
arrangement
,
I
am
the
less
afraid
of
inspection
,
because
,
by
the
natural
bias
of
my
own
mind
,
I
bless
God
,
I
am
above
dark
reserves
,
and
have
not
one
selfish
or
sordid
view
,
to
make
me
wish
to
avoid
the
most
scrutinising
eye
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
begun
a
correspondence
with
Miss
Darnford
,
a
young
lady
of
uncommon
merit
.
<EOS>
But
yet
you
know
her
character
from
my
former
writings
.
<EOS>
She
is
very
solicitous
to
hear
of
all
that
concerns
me
,
and
particularly
how
Lady
Davers
and
I
agree
together
.
<EOS>
I
loved
her
from
the
moment
I
saw
her
first
;
for
she
has
the
least
pride
,
and
the
most
benevolence
and
solid
thought
,
I
ever
knew
in
a
young
lady
,
and
does
not
envy
any
one
.
<EOS>
I
shall
write
to
her
often
:
and
as
I
shall
have
so
many
avocations
besides
to
fill
up
my
time
,
I
know
you
will
excuse
me
,
if
I
procure
from
this
lady
the
return
of
my
letters
to
her
,
for
your
perusal
,
and
for
the
entertainment
of
your
leisure
hours
.
<EOS>
This
will
give
you
,
from
time
to
time
,
the
accounts
<EOS>
you
desire
of
all
that
happens
here
.
<EOS>
But
as
to
what
relates
to
our
own
particulars
,
I
beg
you
will
never
spare
writing
,
as
I
shall
not
answering
;
for
it
is
one
of
my
greatest
delights
,
that
I
have
such
worthy
parents
(
as
I
hope
in
God
,
I
long
shall
)
to
bless
me
and
to
correspond
with
me
.
  
<EOS>
The
papers
I
send
herewith
will
afford
you
some
diversion
,
particularly
those
relating
to
Sir
Simon
Darnford
;
and
I
must
desire
,
that
when
you
have
perused
them
(
as
well
as
what
I
shall
send
for
the
future
)
,
you
will
return
them
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Longman
greatly
pleased
me
,
on
his
last
return
,
in
his
account
of
your
health
,
and
the
satisfaction
you
take
in
your
happy
lot
;
and
I
must
recite
to
you
a
brief
conversation
on
this
occasion
,
<EOS>
which
,
I
dare
say
,
will
please
you
as
much
as
it
did
me
.
  
<EOS>
After
having
adjusted
some
affairs
with
his
dear
principal
,
which
took
up
two
hours
,
my
best
beloved
sent
for
me
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
,
"
said
he
,
seating
me
by
him
,
and
making
the
good
old
gentleman
sit
down
,
(
for
he
will
always
rise
at
my
approach
)
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Longman
and
I
have
settled
,
in
two
hours
,
some
accounts
,
which
would
have
taken
up
as
many
months
with
some
persons
:
for
never
was
there
an
exacter
or
more
methodical
accomptant
.
<EOS>
He
gives
me
(
greatly
to
my
satisfaction
,
because
I
know
it
will
delight
you
)
an
account
of
the
Kentish
concern
,
and
of
the
pleasure
your
father
and
mother
take
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
my
charmer
,
"
said
he
,
"
<EOS>
I
see
your
eyes
begin
to
glisten
:
<EOS>
O
how
this
subject
raises
your
whole
soul
to
the
windows
of
it
!
 
<EOS>
Never
was
so
dutiful
<EOS>
a
daughter
,
Mr.
Longman
;
and
never
did
parents
better
deserve
a
daughter
's
duty
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
endeavoured
before
Mr.
Longman
to
rein
in
a
gratitude
,
that
my
throbbing
heart
confessed
through
my
handkerchief
,
as
I
perceived
:
but
the
good
old
gentleman
could
not
hinder
his
from
shewing
itself
at
his
worthy
eyes
,
to
see
how
much
I
was
favoured
 
oppressed
<EOS>
,
I
should
say
 
with
the
tenderest
goodness
to
me
,
and
kind
expressions
.
 
<EOS>
"
Excuse
me
,
"
said
he
,
wiping
his
cheeks
:
"
my
delight
to
see
such
merit
so
justly
rewarded
will
not
be
contained
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
so
he
arose
and
walked
to
the
window
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
good
Mr.
Longman
,
"
said
I
,
as
he
returned
towards
us
,
"
you
give
me
the
pleasure
to
know
that
my
father
and
mother
are
well
;
and
happy
then
they
must
be
,
in
a
goodness
and
bounty
,
that
I
,
and
many
more
,
rejoice
in
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Well
and
happy
,
Madam
;
 
ay
,
that
they
are
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
A
worthier
couple
never
lived
.
<EOS>
Most
nobly
do
they
go
on
in
the
farm
.
<EOS>
Your
honour
is
one
of
the
happiest
gentlemen
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
All
the
good
you
do
,
returns
upon
you
in
a
trice
.
<EOS>
It
may
well
be
said
you
cast
your
bread
upon
the
waters
;
for
it
presently
comes
to
you
again
,
richer
and
heavier
than
when
you
threw
it
in
.
<EOS>
All
the
Kentish
tenants
,
Madam
,
are
hugely
delighted
with
their
good
steward
:
every
thing
prospers
under
his
management
:
the
gentry
love
both
him
and
my
dame
;
and
the
poor
people
adore
them
.
"
  
<EOS>
Thus
ran
Mr.
Longman
on
,
to
my
inexpressible
delight
,
you
may
believe
;
and
when
he
withdrew
"
'
Tis
an
honest
soul
,
"
said
my
dear
Mr.
B.
<EOS>
"
I
love
him
for
his
respectful
love
to
my
angel
,
and
his
value
for
the
worthy
pair
.
<EOS>
Very
glad
I
am
,
that
every
thing
answers
their
wishes
.
<EOS>
May
they
long
live
,
and
be
happy
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
dear
man
makes
me
spring
to
his
arms
,
whenever
be
touches
this
string
:
for
he
speaks
always
thus
kindly
of
you
;
and
is
glad
to
hear
,
he
says
,
that
you
do
n't
live
only
to
yourselves
;
and
now
and
then
adds
,
that
he
is
as
much
satisfied
with
your
prudence
,
as
he
is
with
mine
;
that
parents
and
daughter
do
credit
to
one
another
:
and
that
the
praises
he
hears
of
you
from
every
mouth
,
make
him
take
as
great
pleasure
in
you
,
as
if
you
were
his
own
relations
.
<EOS>
How
delighting
,
how
transporting
rather
,
my
dear
parents
,
must
this
goodness
be
to
your
happy
daughter
!
<EOS>
And
how
could
I
forbear
repeating
these
kind
things
to
you
,
that
you
may
see
how
well
every
thing
is
taken
that
you
do
?
  
<EOS>
When
the
expected
visit
from
Lord
and
Lady
Davers
is
over
,
the
approaching
winter
will
call
us
to
London
;
and
as
I
shall
then
be
nearer
to
you
,
we
may
oftener
hear
from
one
another
,
which
will
be
a
great
heightening
to
my
pleasures
.
  
<EOS>
But
I
hear
such
an
account
of
the
immoralities
which
persons
may
observe
there
,
along
with
the
public
diversions
,
that
it
takes
off
a
little
from
the
satisfaction
I
should
otherwise
have
in
the
thought
of
going
thither
.
<EOS>
For
,
they
say
,
quarrels
,
and
duels
,
and
gallantries
,
as
they
are
called
,
so
often
happen
in
London
,
that
those
enormities
are
heard
of
without
the
least
wonder
or
surprise
.
  
<EOS>
This
makes
me
very
thoughtful
at
times
.
<EOS>
But
God
,
I
hope
,
will
preserve
our
dearest
benefactor
,
and
continue
to
me
his
affection
,
and
then
I
shall
be
always
happy
;
especially
while
your
healths
and
felicity
confirm
and
crown
the
delights
of
your
ever
dutiful
daughter
,
P.B.
    
MY
DEAREST
CHILD

<EOS>
It
may
not
be
improper
to
mention
ourselves
,
what
the
nature
of
the
kindnesses
is
,
which
we
confer
on
our
poor
neighbours
,
and
the
labouring
people
,
lest
it
should
be
surmised
,
by
any
body
,
that
we
are
lavishing
away
wealth
that
is
not
our
own
.
<EOS>
Not
that
we
fear
either
your
honoured
husband
or
you
will
suspect
so
,
or
that
the
worthy
Mr.
Longman
would
insinuate
as
much
;
for
he
saw
what
we
did
,
and
was
highly
pleased
with
it
,
and
said
he
would
make
such
a
report
of
it
as
you
write
he
did
.
<EOS>
What
we
do
is
in
small
things
,
though
the
good
we
hope
from
them
is
not
small
perhaps
:
and
if
a
very
distressful
case
should
happen
among
our
poor
neighbours
,
requiring
any
thing
considerable
,
and
the
objects
be
deserving
,
we
would
acquaint
you
with
it
,
and
leave
it
to
you
to
do
as
God
should
direct
you
.
  
<EOS>
My
dear
child
,
you
are
very
happy
,
and
if
it
can
be
,
may
you
be
happier
still
!
<EOS>
Yet
I
verily
think
you
can
not
be
more
happy
than
your
father
and
mother
,
except
in
this
one
thing
,
that
all
our
happiness
,
under
God
,
proceeds
from
you
;
and
,
as
other
parents
bless
their
children
with
plenty
and
benefits
<EOS>
,
you
have
blessed
your
parents
(
or
your
honoured
husband
rather
for
your
sake
)
with
all
the
good
things
this
world
can
afford
.
  
<EOS>
Your
papers
are
the
joy
of
our
leisure
hours
;
and
you
are
kind
beyond
all
expression
,
in
taking
care
to
oblige
us
with
them
.
<EOS>
We
know
how
your
time
is
taken
up
,
and
ought
to
be
very
well
contented
,
if
but
now
<EOS>
and
then
you
let
us
hear
of
your
health
and
welfare
.
<EOS>
But
it
is
not
enough
with
such
a
good
daughter
,
that
you
have
made
our
lives
comfortable
,
but
you
will
make
them
joyful
too
,
by
communicating
to
us
,
all
that
befals
you
:
<EOS>
and
then
you
write
so
piously
,
and
with
such
a
sense
of
God
's
goodness
to
you
,
and
intermix
such
good
reflections
in
your
writings
,
that
whether
it
be
our
partial
love
or
not
,
I
can
not
tell
,
but
<EOS>
,
truly
,
we
think
nobody
comes
up
to
you
:
and
you
make
our
hearts
and
eyes
so
often
overflow
,
as
we
read
,
that
we
join
hand
in
hand
,
and
say
to
each
other
,
in
the
same
breath
 
"
Blessed
be
God
,
and
blessed
be
you
,
my
love
,
"
 
"
For
such
a
daughter
,
"
says
the
one
 
<EOS>
"
For
such
a
daughter
,
"
says
the
other
 
<EOS>
"
And
she
has
your
own
sweet
temper
,
"
cry
<EOS>
I.
 
<EOS>
"
And
she
has
your
own
honest
heart
,
"
cries
she
:
<EOS>
and
so
we
go
on
,
blessing
God
,
and
you
,
and
blessing
your
spouse
,
and
ourselves
!
 
<EOS>
Is
any
happiness
like
ours
,
my
dear
daughter
?
  
<EOS>
We
are
really
so
enraptured
with
your
writings
,
that
when
our
spirits
flag
,
through
the
infirmity
of
years
,
which
hath
begun
to
take
hold
of
us
,
we
have
recourse
to
some
of
your
papers
:
 
"
Come
,
my
dear
,
"
cry
I
,
"
what
say
you
to
a
banquet
now
?
"
 
<EOS>
She
knows
what
I
mean
.
<EOS>
"
With
all
my
heart
,
"
says
she
.
<EOS>
So
I
read
although
it
be
on
a
Sunday
,
so
good
are
your
letters
;
and
you
must
know
<EOS>
,
I
have
copies
of
many
,
and
after
a
little
while
we
are
as
much
alive
and
brisk
,
as
if
we
had
no
nagging
at
all
,
and
return
to
the
duties
of
the
day
with
double
delight
.
  
<EOS>
Consider
then
,
my
dear
child
,
what
joy
your
writings
give
us
:
and
yet
we
are
afraid
of
oppressing
you
,
who
have
so
much
to
do
of
other
kinds
;
and
we
are
heartily
glad
you
have
found
out
a
way
to
save
trouble
to
yourself
,
and
rejoice
us
,
and
oblige
so
worthy
a
young
lady
as
Miss
Darnford
,
all
at
one
time
.
<EOS>
I
never
shall
forget
her
dear
goodness
,
and
notice
of
me
at
the
Hall
,
kindly
pressing
my
rough
hands
with
her
fine
hands
,
and
looking
in
my
face
with
so
much
kindness
in
her
eyes
!
 
<EOS>
What
good
people
,
as
well
as
bad
,
there
are
in
high
stations
!
 
<EOS>
Thank
God
there
are
;
<EOS>
else
our
poor
child
would
have
had
a
sad
time
of
it
too
often
,
when
she
was
obliged
to
step
out
of
herself
,
as
once
I
heard
you
phrase
it
,
into
company
you
could
not
live
with
.
  
<EOS>
Well
,
but
what
shall
I
say
more
?
<EOS>
and
yet
how
shall
I
end
?
 
<EOS>
Only
,
with
my
prayers
,
that
God
will
continue
to
you
the
blessing
and
comforts
you
are
in
possession
of
!
 
<EOS>
And
pray
now
,
be
not
over
-
thoughtful
about
London
;
for
why
should
you
let
the
dread
of
future
evils
lessen
your
present
joys
?
 
<EOS>
There
is
no
absolute
perfection
in
this
life
,
that
's
true
;
but
one
would
make
one
's
self
as
easy
as
one
could
.
'
<EOS>
Tis
time
enough
to
be
troubled
when
troubles
come
 
<EOS>
"
Sufficient
unto
the
day
is
the
evil
thereof
.
"
  
<EOS>
Rejoice
,
then
,
as
you
have
often
said
you
would
,
in
your
present
blessings
,
and
leave
the
event
of
things
to
the
Supreme
Disposer
of
all
events
.
<EOS>
And
what
have
you
to
do
but
to
rejoice
?
<EOS>
You
,
who
can
not
see
a
sun
rise
,
but
it
is
to
bless
you
,
and
to
raise
up
from
their
beds
numbers
to
join
in
the
blessing
!
<EOS>
You
who
can
bless
your
high
-
born
friends
,
and
your
low
-
born
parents
,
and
obscure
relations
!
<EOS>
the
rich
by
your
example
,
and
the
poor
by
your
bounty
;
and
bless
besides
so
good
and
so
brave
a
husband
;
 
O
<EOS>
my
dear
child
,
what
,
let
me
repeat
it
,
have
you
to
do
but
rejoice
?
 
<EOS>
For
many
daughters
have
done
wisely
,
but
you
have
excelled
them
all
.
  
<EOS>
I
will
only
add
,
that
every
thing
the
"
squire
ordered
is
just
upon
the
point
of
being
finished
.
<EOS>
And
when
the
good
time
comes
,
that
we
shall
be
again
favoured
with
his
presence
and
yours
<EOS>
,
what
a
still
greater
joy
will
this
afford
to
the
already
overflowing
hearts
of
your
ever
loving
father
and
mother
,
  
JOHN
and
ELIZ

ANDREWS

<EOS>
MY
DEAREST
MISS
DARNFORD
,
  
<EOS>
The
interest
I
take
in
everything
that
concerns
you
,
makes
me
very
importunate
to
know
how
you
approve
the
gentleman
,
whom
some
of
your
best
friends
and
well
-
wishers
have
recommended
to
your
favour
.
<EOS>
I
hope
he
will
deserve
your
good
opinion
,
and
then
he
must
excel
most
of
the
unmarried
gentlemen
in
England
.
  
<EOS>
Your
papa
,
in
his
humourous
manner
,
mentions
his
large
possessions
and
riches
;
but
were
he
as
rich
as
Croesus
,
he
should
not
have
my
consent
,
if
he
has
no
greater
merit
;
though
that
is
what
the
generality
of
parents
look
out
for
first
;
and
indeed
an
easy
fortune
is
so
far
from
being
to
be
disregarded
,
that
,
when
attended
with
equal
merit
,
I
think
it
ought
to
have
a
preference
given
to
it
,
supposing
affections
disengaged
.
<EOS>
For
'
tis
certain
,
that
a
man
or
woman
may
stand
as
good
a
chance
for
happiness
in
marriage
with
a
person
of
fortune
,
as
with
one
who
has
not
that
advantage
;
and
notwithstanding
I
had
neither
riches
nor
descent
to
boast
of
<EOS>
,
I
must
be
of
opinion
with
those
who
say
,
that
they
never
knew
any
body
despise
either
,
that
had
them
.
<EOS>
But
to
permit
riches
to
be
the
principal
inducement
,
to
the
neglect
of
superior
merit
,
that
is
the
fault
which
many
a
one
smarts
for
,
whether
the
choice
be
their
own
,
or
imposed
upon
them
by
those
who
have
a
title
to
their
obedience
.
  
<EOS>
Here
is
a
saucy
body
,
might
some
who
have
not
Miss
Darnford
's
kind
consideration
for
her
friend
,
be
apt
to
say
,
who
being
thus
meanly
descended
,
nevertheless
presumes
to
give
her
opinion
,
in
these
high
cases
,
unasked
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
have
this
to
say
;
that
I
think
myself
so
entirely
divested
of
partiality
to
my
own
case
,
that
,
as
far
as
my
judgment
shall
permit
,
I
will
never
have
that
in
view
,
when
I
am
presuming
to
hint
my
opinion
of
general
rules
.
<EOS>
For
,
most
surely
,
the
honours
I
have
received
,
and
the
debasement
to
which
my
best
friend
had
subjected
himself
,
have
,
for
their
principal
excuse
,
that
the
gentleman
was
entirely
independent
,
had
no
questions
to
ask
,
and
had
a
fortune
sufficient
to
make
himself
,
as
well
as
the
person
he
chose
,
happy
,
though
she
brought
him
nothing
at
all
;
and
that
he
had
,
moreover
,
such
a
character
for
good
sense
,
and
knowledge
of
the
world
,
that
nobody
could
impute
to
him
any
other
inducement
,
but
that
of
a
noble
resolution
to
reward
a
virtue
he
had
so
frequently
,
and
,
I
will
say
,
so
wickedly
,
tried
,
and
could
not
subdue
.
  
<EOS>
My
dear
Miss
,
let
me
,
as
a
subject
very
pleasing
to
me
,
touch
upon
your
kind
mention
of
the
worthy
Mr.
Peters
's
sentiments
to
that
part
of
his
conduct
to
me
,
which
(
oppressed
by
the
terrors
and
apprehensions
to
which
I
was
subjected
)
once
I
censured
;
and
the
readier
,
as
I
had
so
great
an
honour
for
his
cloth
,
that
I
thought
,
to
be
a
clergyman
,
and
all
that
was
compassionate
,
good
,
and
virtuous
,
was
the
same
thing
.
  
<EOS>
But
when
I
came
to
know
Mr.
Peters
,
I
had
a
high
opinion
of
his
worthiness
,
and
as
no
one
can
be
perfect
in
this
life
,
thus
I
thought
to
myself
:
How
hard
was
then
my
lot
,
to
be
the
cause
of
stumbling
to
so
worthy
a
heart
.
<EOS>
To
be
sure
,
a
gentleman
,
one
who
knows
,
and
practises
so
well
,
his
duty
,
in
every
other
instance
,
and
preaches
it
so
efficaciously
to
others
,
must
have
been
one
day
sensible
,
that
it
would
not
have
mis
-
become
his
function
and
character
to
have
afforded
that
protection
to
oppressed
innocence
,
which
was
requested
of
him
:
and
how
would
it
have
grieved
his
considerate
mind
,
had
my
ruin
been
completed
,
that
he
did
not
!
  
<EOS>
But
as
he
had
once
a
namesake
,
as
one
may
say
,
that
failed
in
a
much
greater
instance
,
let
not
my
want
of
charity
exceed
his
fault
;
but
let
me
look
upon
it
as
an
infirmity
,
to
which
the
most
perfect
are
liable
;
I
was
a
stranger
to
him
;
a
servant
girl
carried
off
by
her
master
,
a
young
gentleman
of
violent
and
lawless
passions
,
who
,
in
this
very
instance
,
shewed
how
much
in
earnest
he
was
set
upon
effecting
all
his
vile
purposes
;
and
whose
heart
,
although
God
might
touch
,
it
was
not
probable
any
lesser
influence
<EOS>
could
.
<EOS>
Then
he
was
not
sure
,
that
,
though
he
might
assist
my
escape
,
I
might
not
afterwards
fall
again
into
the
hands
of
so
determined
a
violator
:
and
that
difficulty
would
not
,
with
such
an
one
,
enhance
his
resolution
to
overcome
all
obstacles
.
  
<EOS>
Moreover
,
he
might
think
,
that
the
person
,
who
was
moving
him
to
this
worthy
measure
,
possibly
sought
to
gratify
a
view
of
his
own
,
and
that
while
endeavouring
to
save
,
to
outward
appearance
,
a
virtue
in
danger
,
he
was
,
in
reality
,
only
helping
another
to
a
wife
,
at
the
hazard
of
exposing
himself
to
the
vindictiveness
of
a
violent
temper
,
and
a
rich
neighbour
,
who
had
power
as
well
as
will
to
resent
;
for
such
was
his
apprehension
,
entirely
groundless
as
it
was
,
though
not
improbable
,
as
it
might
seem
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
For
all
these
considerations
,
I
must
pity
,
rather
than
too
rigorously
censure
,
the
worthy
gentleman
,
and
I
will
always
respect
him
.
<EOS>
And
thank
him
a
thousand
times
,
my
dear
,
in
my
name
,
for
his
goodness
in
condescending
to
acknowledge
,
by
your
hand
,
his
infirmity
,
as
such
;
for
this
gives
an
excellent
proof
of
the
natural
worthiness
of
his
heart
;
and
that
it
is
beneath
him
to
seek
to
extenuate
a
fault
,
when
he
thinks
he
has
committed
one
.
  
<EOS>
Indeed
,
my
dear
friend
,
I
have
so
much
honour
for
the
clergy
of
all
degrees
,
that
I
never
forget
in
my
prayers
one
article
,
that
God
will
make
them
shining
lights
to
the
world
;
since
so
much
depends
on
their
ministry
and
examples
,
as
well
with
respect
to
our
public
as
private
duties
.
<EOS>
Nor
shall
the
faults
of
a
few
make
impression
upon
me
to
the
disadvantage
of
the
order
;
for
I
am
afraid
a
very
censorious
temper
,
in
this
respect
,
is
too
generally
the
indication
of
an
uncharitable
and
perhaps
a
profligate
heart
,
levelling
characters
,
in
order
to
cover
some
inward
pride
,
or
secret
enormities
,
which
they
are
ashamed
to
avow
,
and
will
not
be
instructed
to
amend
.
  
<EOS>
Forgive
,
my
dear
,
this
tedious
scribble
;
I
can
not
for
my
life
write
short
letters
to
those
I
love
.
<EOS>
And
let
me
hope
that
you
will
favour
me
with
an
account
of
your
new
affair
,
and
how
you
proceed
in
it
;
and
with
such
of
your
conversations
,
as
may
give
me
some
notion
of
a
polite
courtship
.
<EOS>
For
,
alas
!
<EOS>
your
poor
friend
knows
nothing
of
this
.
<EOS>
All
her
courtship
was
sometimes
a
hasty
snatch
of
the
hand
,
a
black
and
blue
gripe
of
the
arm
,
and
 
<EOS>
"
Whither
now
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Come
to
me
when
I
bid
you
!
"
<EOS>
And
Saucy
-
face
,
and
Creature
,
and
such
like
,
on
his
part
 
with
fear
and
trembling
on
mine
;
and
 
"
I
will
,
I
will
!
 
<EOS>
Good
Sir
,
have
mercy
!
"
<EOS>
At
other
times
a
scream
,
and
nobody
to
hear
or
mind
me
;
and
with
uplift
hands
,
bent
knees
,
and
tearful
eyes
 
<EOS>
"
For
God
's
sake
,
pity
your
poor
servant
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
,
my
dear
Miss
Darnford
,
was
the
hard
treatment
that
attended
my
courtship
 
<EOS>
pray
,
then
,
let
me
know
,
how
gentlemen
court
their
equals
in
degree
;
how
they
look
when
they
address
you
,
with
their
knees
bent
,
sighing
,
supplicating
,
and
all
that
,
as
Sir
Simon
says
,
with
the
words
Slave
,
Servant
,
Admirer
,
continually
at
their
tongue
's
end
.
  
<EOS>
But
after
all
,
it
will
be
found
<EOS>
,
I
believe
,
that
be
the
language
and
behaviour
ever
so
obsequious
,
it
is
all
designed
to
end
alike
 
<EOS>
The
English
,
the
plain
English
,
of
the
politest
address
,
is
,
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
now
,
dear
Madam
,
your
humble
servant
:
<EOS>
pray
be
so
good
as
to
let
me
be
your
master
,
"
 
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
and
thank
you
too
,
"
says
the
lady
's
heart
,
though
not
her
lips
,
if
she
likes
him
.
<EOS>
And
so
they
go
to
church
together
;
and
,
in
conclusion
,
it
will
be
happy
,
if
these
obsequious
courtships
end
no
worse
than
my
frightful
one
.
  
<EOS>
But
I
am
convinced
,
that
with
a
man
of
sense
,
a
woman
of
tolerable
prudence
must
be
happy
.
  
<EOS>
That
whenever
you
marry
,
it
may
be
to
such
a
man
,
who
then
must
value
you
as
you
deserve
,
and
make
you
happy
as
I
now
am
,
notwithstanding
all
that
's
past
,
wishes
and
prays
your
obliged
friend
and
servant
,

In
answer
to
the
preceding
  
<EOS>
MY
DEAR
MRS
.
<EOS>
B.
,
  
<EOS>
You
charm
us
all
with
your
letters
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Peters
says
,
he
will
never
go
to
bed
,
nor
rise
,
but
he
will
pray
for
you
,
and
desires
I
will
return
his
thankful
acknowledgment
for
your
favourable
opinion
of
him
,
and
kind
allowances
.
<EOS>
If
there
be
an
angel
on
earth
,
he
says
,
you
are
one
.
<EOS>
My
papa
,
although
he
has
seen
your
stinging
reflection
upon
his
refusal
to
protect
you
,
is
delighted
with
you
too
;
and
says
,
when
you
come
down
to
Lincolnshire
again
,
he
will
be
undertaken
by
you
in
good
earnest
:
for
he
thinks
it
was
wrong
in
him
to
deny
you
his
protection
.
  
<EOS>
We
all
smiled
at
the
description
of
your
own
uncommon
courtship
.
<EOS>
And
,
as
they
say
the
days
of
courtship
are
the
happiest
part
of
life
,
if
we
had
not
known
that
your
days
of
marriage
are
happier
by
far
than
any
other
body
's
courtship
,
we
must
needs
have
pitied
.
<EOS>
But
as
the
one
were
days
of
trial
and
temptation
,
the
others
are
days
of
reward
and
happiness
:
may
the
last
always
continue
to
be
so
,
and
you
'll
have
no
occasion
to
think
any
body
happier
than
Mrs.
B.
!
  
<EOS>
I
thank
you
heartily
for
your
good
wishes
as
to
the
man
of
sense
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Murray
has
been
here
,
and
continues
his
visits
.
<EOS>
He
is
a
lively
gentleman
,
well
enough
in
his
person
,
has
a
tolerable
character
,
yet
loves
company
,
and
will
take
his
bottle
freely
;
my
papa
likes
him
ne'er
the
worse
for
that
:
he
talks
a
good
deal
;
dresses
gay
,
and
even
richly
,
and
seems
to
like
his
own
person
<EOS>
very
well
 
<EOS>
no
great
pleasure
this
for
a
lady
to
look
forward
to
;
yet
he
falls
far
short
of
that
genteel
ease
and
graceful
behaviour
,
which
distinguish
your
Mr.
B.
from
any
body
I
know
.
  
<EOS>
I
wish
Mr.
Murray
would
apply
to
my
sister
.
<EOS>
She
is
an
ill
-
natured
girl
;
but
would
make
a
good
wife
,
I
hope
;
and
fancy
she
'd
like
him
<EOS>
well
enough
.
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
say
I
do
.
<EOS>
He
laughs
too
much
;
has
something
boisterous
in
his
conversation
:
his
complaisance
is
not
pretty
;
he
is
,
however
,
well
versed
in
country
sports
;
and
my
papa
loves
him
for
that
too
,
and
says
 
"
He
is
a
most
accomplished
gentleman
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
Sir
,
"
cry
I
,
"
as
gentlemen
go
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
must
be
saucy
,
"
says
Sir
Simon
,
"
because
the
man
offers
himself
to
your
acceptance
.
<EOS>
A
few
years
hence
,
perhaps
,
if
you
remain
single
,
you
'll
alter
your
note
,
Polly
,
and
be
willing
to
jump
at
a
much
less
worthy
tender
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
could
not
help
answering
that
,
although
I
paid
due
honour
to
all
my
papa
<EOS>
was
pleased
to
say
,
I
could
not
but
hope
he
would
be
mistaken
in
this
.
<EOS>
But
I
have
broken
my
mind
to
my
dear
mamma
,
who
tells
me
,
she
will
do
me
all
the
pleasure
she
can
;
but
would
be
loth
the
youngest
daughter
should
go
first
,
as
she
calls
it
.
<EOS>
But
if
I
could
come
and
live
with
you
a
little
now
<EOS>
and
then
,
I
did
not
care
who
married
,
unless
such
an
one
offered
as
I
never
expect
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
great
hopes
the
gentleman
will
be
easily
persuaded
to
quit
me
for
Nancy
;
for
I
see
he
has
not
delicacy
enough
to
love
with
any
great
distinction
.
<EOS>
He
says
,
as
my
mamma
tells
me
by
the
bye
,
that
I
am
the
handsomest
,
and
best
humoured
,
and
he
has
found
out
as
he
thinks
,
that
I
have
some
wit
,
and
have
ease
and
freedom
(
and
he
tacks
innocence
to
them
)
in
my
address
and
conversation
.
'
<EOS>
Tis
well
for
me
,
he
is
of
this
opinion
:
for
if
he
thinks
justly
,
which
I
must
question
,
any
body
may
think
so
still
much
more
;
for
I
have
been
far
from
taking
pains
to
engage
his
good
word
,
having
been
under
more
reserve
to
him
,
than
ever
I
was
before
to
any
body
.
  
<EOS>
Indeed
,
I
ca
n't
help
it
:
for
the
gentleman
is
forward
without
delicacy
;
and
(
pardon
me
,
Sir
Simon
)
<EOS>
my
papa
has
not
one
bit
of
it
neither
;
but
is
for
pushing
matters
on
,
with
his
rough
raillery
,
that
puts
me
out
of
countenance
,
and
has
already
adjusted
the
sordid
part
of
the
preliminaries
,
as
he
tells
me
.
  
<EOS>
Yet
I
hope
Nancy
's
three
thousand
pound
fortune
more
than
I
am
likely
to
have
,
will
give
her
the
wished
-
for
preference
with
Mr.
Murray
;
and
then
,
as
to
a
brother
-
in
-
law
,
in
prospect
,
I
can
put
off
all
restraint
,
and
return
to
my
usual
freedom
.
  
<EOS>
This
is
all
that
occurs
worthy
of
notice
from
us
:
but
from
you
,
we
expect
an
account
of
Lady
Davers
's
visit
,
and
of
the
conversations
that
offer
among
you
;
and
you
have
so
delightful
a
way
of
making
every
thing
momentous
,
either
by
your
subject
or
reflections
,
or
both
,
that
we
long
for
every
post
-
day
,
in
hopes
of
the
pleasure
of
a
letter
.
<EOS>
And
yours
I
will
always
carefully
preserve
,
as
so
many
testimonies
of
the
honour
I
receive
in
this
correspondence
:
which
will
be
always
esteemed
as
it
deserves
,
by
,
<EOS>
my
dear
Mrs.
B.
,
your
obliged
and
faithful
  
POLLY
DARNFORD
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Peters
,
Mrs.
Jones
,

papa
,
mamma
,
and
sister
,
present
their
respects
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Peters
I
mentioned
before
.
<EOS>
He
continues
to
give
a
very
good
account
of
poor
Jewkes
;
and
is
much
pleased
with
her
.
    
<EOS>
MY
DEAR
MISS
DARNFORD
,
  
<EOS>
At
your
desire
,
and
to
oblige
your
honoured
mamma
,
and
your
good
neighbours
,
I
will
now
acquaint
you
with
the
arrival
of
Lady
Davers
,
and
will
occasionally
write
what
passes
among
us
,
I
will
not
say
worthy
of
notice
;
for
were
I
only
to
do
so
<EOS>
,
I
should
be
more
brief
,
perhaps
,
by
much
,
than
you
seem
to
expect
.
<EOS>
But
as
my
time
is
pretty
much
taken
up
,
and
I
find
I
shall
be
obliged
to
write
a
bit
now
,
and
a
bit
then
,
you
must
excuse
me
,
if
I
dispense
with
some
forms
,
which
I
ought
to
observe
,
when
I
write
to
one
I
so
dearly
love
;
and
so
I
will
give
it
<EOS>
journal
-
wise
,
as
it
were
,
and
have
no
regard
,
when
it
would
fetter
or
break
in
upon
my
freedom
of
narration
,
to
inscription
or
subscription
;
but
send
it
as
I
have
opportunity
,
and
if
you
please
to
favour
me
so
far
,
as
to
lend
it
me
,
after
you
have
read
the
stuff
,
for
the
perusal
of
my
father
and
mother
,
to
whom
my
duty
,
and
promise
require
me
to
give
an
account
of
my
proceedings
,
it
will
save
me
transcription
,
for
which
I
shall
have
no
time
;
and
then
you
will
excuse
blots
and
blurs
,
and
I
will
trouble
myself
no
farther
for
apologies
on
that
score
,
but
this
once
for
all
.
  
<EOS>
If
you
think
it
worth
while
when
they
have
read
it
,
you
shall
have
it
again
.
  
<EOS>
WEDNESDAY
MORNING
,
SIX
O'CLOCK
.
  
<EOS>
For
my
dear
friend
permits
me
to
rise
an
hour
sooner
than
usual
,
that
I
may
have
time
to
scribble
;
for
he
is
always
pleased
to
see
me
so
employed
,
or
in
reading
;
often
saying
,
when
I
am
at
my
needle
,
(
as
his
sister
once
wrote
)
"
Your
maids
can
do
this
,
Pamela
:
but
they
can
not
write
as
you
can
.
"
<EOS>
And
yet
,
as
he
says
,
when
I
choose
to
follow
my
needle
,
as
a
diversion
from
too
intense
study
,
<EOS>
(
but
,
alas
!
<EOS>
I
know
not
what
study
is
,
as
may
be
easily
guessed
by
my
hasty
writing
,
putting
down
every
thing
as
it
comes
)
<EOS>
I
shall
then
do
as
I
please
.
<EOS>
But
I
promised
at
setting
out
,
what
a
good
wife
<EOS>
I
'd
endeavour
to
make
:
and
every
honest
body
should
try
to
be
as
good
as
her
word
,
you
know
,
and
such
particulars
as
I
then
mentioned
<EOS>
,
I
think
I
ought
to
dispense
with
as
little
as
possible
;
especially
as
I
promised
no
more
than
what
was
my
duty
to
perform
,
if
I
had
not
promised
.
<EOS>
But
what
a
preamble
is
here
?
<EOS>
Judge
by
it
<EOS>
what
impertinences
you
may
expect
as
I
proceed
.
  
<EOS>
Yesterday
evening
arrived
here
my
Lord
and
Lady
Davers
,
their
nephew
,
and
the
Countess
of
C.
,
mother
of
Lady
Betty
,
whom
we
did
not
expect
,
but
took
it
for
the
greater
favour
.
<EOS>
It
seems
her
ladyship
longed
,
as
she
said
,
to
see
me
;
and
this
was
her
principal
inducement
.
<EOS>
The
two
ladies
,
and
their
two
women
,
were
in
Lord
Davers
's
coach
and
six
,
and
my
lord
and
his
nephew
rode
on
horseback
,
attended
with
a
train
of
servants
.
  
<EOS>
We
had
expected
them
to
dinner
;
but
they
could
not
reach
time
enough
;
for
the
countess
being
a
little
incommoded
with
her
journey
,
the
coach
travelled
slowly
.
<EOS>
My
lady
would
not
suffer
her
lord
,
nor
his
nephew
,
to
come
hither
before
her
,
though
on
horseback
,
because
she
would
be
present
,
she
said
,
when
his
lordship
first
saw
me
,
he
having
quite
forgot
her
mother
's
Pamela
;
that
was
her
word
.
  
<EOS>
It
rained
when
they
came
in
;
so
the
coach
drove
directly
to
the
door
,
and
Mr.
B.
received
them
there
;
but
I
was
in
a
little
sort
of
flutter
,
which
Mr.
B.
observing
,
made
me
sit
down
in
the
parlour
to
compose
myself
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Where
's
Pamela
?
"
said
my
lady
,
as
soon
as
she
alighted
.
  
<EOS>
I
stept
out
,
lest
she
should
take
it
amiss
:
<EOS>
and
she
took
my
hand
,
and
kissed
me
:
"
<EOS>
Here
,
my
lady
countess
,
"
said
she
,
presenting
me
to
her
,
"
here
's
the
girl
;
see
if
I
said
too
much
in
praise
of
her
person
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
countess
saluted
me
with
a
visible
pleasure
in
her
eye
,
and
said
,
"
Indeed
,
Lady
Davers
,
you
have
not
.
 
<EOS>
'
Twould
have
been
strange
(
excuse
me
,
Mrs.
B.
,
for
I
know
your
story
)
,
if
such
a
fine
flower
had
not
been
transplanted
from
the
field
to
the
garden
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
made
no
return
,
but
by
a
low
curtsey
,
to
her
ladyship
's
compliment
.
<EOS>
Then
Lady
Davers
taking
my
hand
again
,
presented
me
to
her
lord
:
"
See
here
,
my
lord
,
my
mother
's
Pamela
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
see
here
,
my
lord
,
"
said
her
generous
brother
,
taking
my
other
hand
most
kindly
,
"
see
here
your
brother
's
Pamela
too
!
"
  
<EOS>
My
lord
saluted
me
:
"
I
do
,
"
said
he
to
his
lady
,
and
to
his
brother
;
"
and
I
see
the
first
person
in
her
,
that
has
exceeded
my
expectation
,
when
every
mouth
had
prepared
me
to
expect
a
wonder
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
H.
,
whom
every
one
calls
Lord
Jackey
,
after
his
aunt
's
example
,
when
she
is
in
good
humour
with
him
,
and
who
is
a
very
young
gentleman
,
though
about
as
old
as
my
best
friend
,
came
to
me
next
,
and
said
,
"
Lovelier
and
lovelier
,
by
my
life
!
 
<EOS>
I
never
saw
your
peer
,
Madam
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Will
you
excuse
me
,
my
dear
,
all
this
seeming
vanity
,
for
the
sake
of
repeating
exactly
what
passed
?
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
but
,
"
said
my
lady
,
taking
my
hand
,
in
her
free
quality
way
,
which
quite
dashed
me
,
and
holding
it
at
a
distance
,
and
turning
me
half
round
,
her
eye
fixed
to
my
waist
,
"
let
me
observe
you
a
little
,
my
sweet
-
faced
girl
;
 
<EOS>
I
hope
I
am
right
<EOS>
:
I
hope
you
will
do
credit
to
my
brother
,
as
he
has
done
you
credit
.
<EOS>
Why
do
you
let
her
lace
so
tight
,
Mr.
B.
?
"
  
<EOS>
I
was
unable
to
look
up
,
as
you
may
believe
,
Miss
:
<EOS>
my
face
,
all
over
scarlet
,
was
hid
in
my
bosom
,
and
I
looked
so
silly
!
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
"
said
my
naughty
lady
,
"
you
may
well
look
down
,
my
good
girl
:
for
works
of
this
nature
will
not
be
long
hidden
.
 
<EOS>
And
,
oh
!
<EOS>
my
lady
,
"
(
to
the
countess
)
"
see
how
like
a
pretty
thief
she
looks
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
my
lady
!
"
<EOS>
said
I
:
<EOS>
for
she
still
kept
looking
at
me
:
and
<EOS>
her
good
brother
,
seeing
my
confusion
,
in
pity
to
me
,
pressed
my
blushing
<EOS>
face
a
moment
to
his
generous
breast
,
and
said
,
"
Lady
Davers
,
you
should
not
be
thus
hard
upon
my
dear
girl
,
the
moment
you
see
her
,
and
before
so
many
witnesses
:
 
but
look
up
,
my
best
love
,
take
your
revenge
of
my
sister
,
and
tell
her
,
you
wish
her
in
the
same
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
so
then
?
"
said
my
lady
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
glad
of
it
with
all
my
heart
.
<EOS>
I
will
now
love
you
better
and
better
:
but
I
almost
doubted
it
,
seeing
her
still
so
slender
.
<EOS>
But
if
,
my
good
child
,
you
lace
too
tight
,
I
'll
never
forgive
you
.
"
<EOS>
And
so
she
gave
me
a
kiss
of
congratulation
,
as
she
said
.
  
<EOS>
Do
you
think
I
did
not
look
very
silly
?
<EOS>
My
lord
,
smiling
,
and
gazing
at
me
from
head
to
foot
;
Lord
Jackey
grinning
and
laughing
,
like
an
oaf
,
as
I
then
,
in
my
spite
,
thought
.
<EOS>
Indeed
the
countess
said
,
encouragingly
to
me
,
but
severely
in
persons
of
birth
,
"
Lady
Davers
,
you
are
as
much
too
teazing
,
as
Mrs.
B.
is
too
bashful
.
<EOS>
But
you
are
a
happy
man
,
Mr.
B.
,
that
your
lady
's
bashfulness
is
the
principal
mark
by
which
we
can
judge
she
is
not
of
quality
.
"
<EOS>
Lord
Jackey
,
in
the
language
of
some
character
in
a
play
,
cried
out
,
"
A
palpable
hit
,
by
Jupiter
!
"
and
laughed
egregiously
,
running
about
from
one
to
another
,
repeating
the
same
words
.
  
<EOS>
We
talked
only
upon
common
topics
till
supper
-
time
,
and
I
was
all
ear
,
as
I
thought
it
became
me
to
be
;
for
the
countess
had
,
by
her
first
compliment
,
and
by
an
aspect
as
noble
as
intelligent
,
overawed
me
,
as
I
may
say
,
into
a
respectful
silence
,
to
which
Lady
Davers
's
free
,
though
pleasant
raillery
(
which
she
could
not
help
carrying
on
now
-
and
-
then
)
contributed
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
Lady
Davers
's
letters
had
given
me
still
greater
reason
to
revere
her
wit
and
judgment
than
I
had
before
,
when
I
reflected
on
her
passionate
temper
,
and
such
parts
of
the
conversation
I
had
had
with
her
ladyship
in
your
neighbourhood
;
which
(
however
to
be
admired
)
fell
short
of
her
letters
.
  
<EOS>
When
we
were
to
sit
down
at
table
,
I
looked
,
I
suppose
,
a
little
diffidently
:
for
I
really
then
thought
of
my
lady
's
anger
at
the
Hall
,
when
she
would
not
have
permitted
me
to
sit
at
table
with
her
;
and
Mr.
B.
saying
,
"
Take
your
place
,
my
dear
;
you
keep
our
friends
standing
;
"
I
sat
down
in
my
usual
seat
.
<EOS>
And
my
lady
said
,
"
None
of
your
reproaching
eye
,
Pamela
;
I
know
what
you
hint
at
by
it
;
and
every
letter
I
have
received
from
you
has
made
me
censure
myself
for
my
lady
-
airs
,
as
you
call
'em
,
you
sauce
-
box
<EOS>
you
<EOS>
:
I
told
you
,
I
'd
lady
-
airs
you
when
I
saw
you
;
and
you
shall
have
it
all
in
good
time
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
,
"
said
I
,
"
I
shall
have
nothing
from
your
ladyship
,
but
what
will
be
very
agreeable
:
<EOS>
but
,
indeed
,
I
never
meant
any
thing
particular
by
that
,
or
any
other
word
that
I
wrote
;
nor
could
I
think
of
any
thing
but
what
was
highly
respectful
to
your
ladyship
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Lord
Davers
was
pleased
to
say
,
that
it
was
impossible
I
should
either
write
or
speak
any
thing
that
could
be
taken
amiss
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Davers
,
after
supper
,
and
the
servants
were
withdrawn
,
began
a
discourse
on
titles
,
and
said
,
"
Brother
,
I
think
you
should
hold
yourself
obliged
to
my
Lord
Davers
;
for
he
has
spoken
to
Lord
S.
who
made
him
a
visit
a
few
days
ago
,
to
procure
you
a
baronet
's
patent
.
<EOS>
Your
estate
,
and
the
figure
you
make
in
the
world
,
are
so
considerable
,
and
your
family
besides
is
so
ancient
,
that
,
methinks
,
you
should
wish
for
some
distinction
of
that
sort
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
brother
,
"
said
my
lord
,
"
I
did
mention
it
to
Lord
S.
and
told
him
,
withal
,
that
it
was
without
your
knowledge
or
desire
that
I
spoke
about
it
;
and
I
was
not
very
sure
you
would
accept
of
it
;
but
'
tis
a
thing
your
sister
has
wished
for
a
good
while
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
answer
did
my
Lord
S.
make
to
it
?
"
said
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
  
"
He
said
,
"
We
,
"
meaning
the
ministers
,
I
suppose
,
"
should
be
glad
to
oblige
a
man
of
Mr.
B.
's
figure
in
the
world
;
but
you
mention
it
so
slightly
,
that
you
can
hardly
expect
courtiers
will
tender
it
to
any
gentleman
that
is
so
indifferent
about
it
;
for
,
Lord
Davers
,
we
seldom
grant
honours
without
a
view
:
I
tell
you
that
,
"
added
he
,
smiling
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
Lord
S.
might
mention
this
as
a
jest
,
"
returned
Mr.
B.
,
"
but
he
spoke
the
truth
.
<EOS>
But
your
lordship
said
well
,
that
I
was
indifferent
about
it
.
'
<EOS>
Tis
true
,
'
tis
an
hereditary
title
;
but
the
rich
citizens
,
who
used
to
be
satisfied
with
the
title
of
Knight
,
(
till
they
made
it
so
common
,
that
it
is
brought
into
as
great
contempt
almost
as
that
of
the
French
knights
of
St.
Michael,[1
]
and
nobody
cares
to
accept
of
it
)
<EOS>
now
are
ambitious
of
this
;
and
,
as
I
apprehend
,
it
is
hastening
apace
into
like
disrepute
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
'
tis
a
novel
honour
,
and
what
the
ancestors
of
our
family
,
who
lived
at
its
institution
,
would
never
accept
of
.
<EOS>
But
were
it
a
peerage
,
which
has
some
essential
privileges
and
splendours
annexed
to
it
,
to
make
it
desirable
to
some
men
,
I
would
not
enter
into
conditions
for
it
.
<EOS>
Titles
at
best
,
"
added
he
,
"
are
but
shadows
;
and
he
that
has
the
substance
should
be
above
valuing
them
;
for
who
that
has
the
whole
bird
,
would
pride
himself
upon
a
single
feather
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
But
,
"
said
my
lady
,
"
although
I
acknowledge
that
the
institution
is
of
late
date
,
yet
,
as
abroad
,
as
well
as
at
home
,
it
is
regarded
as
a
title
of
dignity
,
and
the
best
families
among
the
gentry
are
supposed
to
be
distinguished
by
it
<EOS>
,
I
should
wish
you
to
accept
of
it
.
<EOS>
And
as
to
citizens
who
have
it
,
they
are
not
many
;
and
some
of
this
class
of
people
,
or
their
immediate
descendants
,
have
bought
themselves
into
the
peerage
itself
of
the
one
kingdom
or
the
other
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
[
Footnote

<EOS>
This
order
was
become
so
scandalously
common
in
France
,
that
,
to
order
to
suppress
it
,
the
hangman
was
vested
with
the
ensigns
of
it
,
which
effectually
abolished
it
.
]
  
<EOS>
"
As
to
what
it
is
looked
upon
abroad
,
"
said
Mr.
B.
,
"
this
is
of
no
weight
at
all
;
for
when
an
Englishman
travels
,
be
he
of
what
degree
he
will
,
if
he
has
an
equipage
,
and
squanders
his
money
away
,
he
is
a
lord
of
course
with
foreigners
:
and
therefore
Sir
Such
-
a
-
one
is
rather
a
diminution
to
him
,
as
it
gives
him
a
lower
title
than
his
vanity
would
perhaps
make
him
aspire
to
be
thought
in
the
possession
of
.
<EOS>
Then
,
as
to
citizens
,
in
a
trading
nation
like
this
,
I
am
not
displeased
in
the
main
,
with
seeing
the
overgrown
ones
creeping
into
nominal
honours
;
and
we
have
so
many
of
our
first
titled
families
,
who
have
allied
themselves
to
trade
,
(
whose
inducements
were
money
only
)
that
it
ceases
to
be
either
a
wonder
as
to
the
fact
,
or
a
disgrace
as
to
the
honour
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
brother
,
"
said
my
lady
,
"
I
will
tell
you
farther
,
the
thing
may
be
had
for
asking
for
;
if
you
will
but
go
to
court
,
and
desire
to
kiss
the
king
's
hand
,
that
will
be
all
the
trouble
you
'll
have
:
and
pray
now
oblige
me
in
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
a
title
would
make
me
either
a
better
or
a
wiser
man
,
"
replied
Mr.
B.
,
"
I
would
embrace
it
with
pleasure
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
I
am
not
so
satisfied
with
some
of
the
measures
now
pursuing
,
as
to
owe
any
obligation
to
the
ministers
.
<EOS>
Accepting
of
a
small
title
from
them
,
is
but
like
putting
on
their
badge
,
or
listing
under
their
banners
;
like
a
certain
lord
we
all
know
,
who
accepted
of
one
degree
more
of
title
to
shew
he
was
theirs
,
and
would
not
have
an
higher
,
lest
it
should
be
thought
a
satisfaction
tantamount
to
half
the
pension
he
demanded
:
and
could
I
be
easy
to
have
it
supposed
,
that
I
was
an
ungrateful
man
for
voting
as
I
pleased
,
because
they
gave
me
the
title
of
a
baronet
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
countess
said
,
the
world
always
thought
Mr.
B.
to
be
a
man
of
steady
principles
,
and
not
attached
to
any
party
;
but
,
in
her
opinion
,
it
was
far
from
being
inconsistent
with
any
gentleman
's
honour
and
independency
,
to
accept
of
a
title
from
a
prince
he
acknowledged
as
his
sovereign
.
  
<EOS>
"
'
Tis
very
true
.
<EOS>
Madam
,
that
I
am
attached
to
no
party
,
nor
ever
will
.
<EOS>
I
will
be
a
country
gentleman
,
in
the
true
sense
of
the
word
,
and
will
accept
of
no
favour
that
shall
make
any
one
think
I
would
not
be
of
the
opposition
when
I
think
it
a
necessary
one
;
as
,
on
the
other
hand
,
I
should
scorn
to
make
myself
a
round
to
any
man
's
ladder
of
preferment
,
or
a
caballer
for
the
sake
of
my
own
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
say
well
,
brother
,
"
returned
Lady
Davers
;
"
but
you
may
undoubtedly
keep
your
own
principles
and
independency
,
and
yet
pay
your
duty
to
the
king
,
and
accept
of
this
title
;
for
your
family
and
fortune
will
be
a
greater
ornament
to
the
title
,
than
the
title
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
what
occasion
have
I
for
it
,
if
that
be
the
case
,
Madam
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
I
ca
n't
say
,
but
I
should
be
glad
you
had
it
,
for
your
family
's
sake
,
as
it
is
an
hereditary
honour
.
<EOS>
Then
it
would
mend
the
style
of
your
spouse
here
;
for
the
good
girl
is
at
such
a
loss
for
an
epithet
when
she
writes
,
that
I
see
the
constraint
she
lies
under
.
<EOS>
It
is
,
"
My
dear
gentleman
,
my
best
friend
,
my
benefactor
,
my
dear
Mr.
B.
"
whereas
Sir
William
would
turn
off
her
periods
more
roundly
,
and
no
other
softer
epithets
would
be
wanting
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
To
me
,
"
replied
he
,
"
who
always
desire
to
be
distinguished
as
my
Pamela
's
best
friend
,
and
think
it
an
honour
to
be
called
her
dear
Mr.
B.
and
her
dear
man
,
this
reason
weighs
very
little
,
unless
there
were
no
other
Sir
William
in
the
kingdom
than
her
Sir
William
:
<EOS>
for
I
am
very
emulous
of
her
favour
,
I
can
tell
you
,
and
think
it
no
small
distinction
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
blushed
at
this
too
great
honour
,
before
such
company
,
and
was
afraid
my
lady
would
be
a
little
picqued
at
it
.
<EOS>
But
after
a
pause
,
she
said
,
"
Well
,
then
,
brother
,
will
you
let
Pamela
decide
upon
this
point
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Rightly
put

said
the
countess

"
<EOS>
Pray
let
Mrs.

for
you

My

hit
the
thing

"
Very
good

says
Lord
Jackey

my

that

choose

"
  
<EOS>
"
Well

said
Mr.

"
give
us
your
opinion
,
as
to
this
point

<EOS>
"
  
"
But
,
first
,
"
said
Lady
Davers
,
"
say
you
will
be
determined
by
it
;
or
else
she
will
be
laid
under
a
difficulty

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
then
,
"
replied
he
,
"
be
it
<EOS>
so
 
I
will
be
determined
by
your
opinion
,
my
dear
;
give
it
me
freely
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lord
Jackey
rubbed
his
hands
together
,
"
Charming
,
charming
,
as
I
hope
to
live
!
<EOS>
By
Jove
,
this
is
just
as
I
wished
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
now
,
Pamela
,
"
said
my
lady
,
"
speak
your
true
heart
without
disguise
:
I
charge
you
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
then
,
gentlemen
and
ladies
,
"
said
I
,
"
if
I
must
be
so
bold
as
to
speak
on
a
subject
,
upon
which
on
several
accounts
,
it
would
become
me
to
be
silent
,
I
should
be
against
the
title
;
but
perhaps
my
reason
is
of
too
private
a
nature
to
weigh
any
thing
:
and
if
so
,
it
would
not
become
me
to
have
any
choice
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
They
all
called
upon
me
for
my
reason
;
and
I
said
,
looking
down
a
little
abashed
,
"
It
is
this
:
Here
my
dear
Mr.
B.
has
disparaged
himself
by
distinguishing
,
as
he
has
done
,
such
a
low
creature
as
I
;
and
the
world
will
be
apt
to
say
,
he
is
seeking
to
repair
one
way
the
honour
he
has
lost
another
!
<EOS>
and
then
perhaps
,
it
will
be
attributed
to
my
pride
and
ambition
:
"
<EOS>
Here
,
they
will
perhaps
say
,
"
the
proud
cottager
will
needs
be
a
lady
in
hopes
to
conceal
her
descent
;
"
whereas
,
had
I
such
a
vain
thought
,
it
would
be
but
making
it
the
more
remembered
against
both
Mr.
B.
and
myself
.
<EOS>
And
indeed
,
as
to
my
own
part
,
I
take
too
much
pride
in
having
been
lifted
up
into
this
distinction
for
the
causes
to
which
I
owe
it
,
your
brother
's
bounty
and
generosity
,
than
to
be
ashamed
of
what
I
was
:
only
now
-
and
-
then
I
am
concerned
for
his
own
sake
,
lest
he
should
be
too
much
censured
.
<EOS>
But
this
would
not
be
prevented
,
but
rather
be
promoted
by
the
title
.
<EOS>
So
I
am
humbly
of
opinion
against
the
title
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
had
hardly
patience
to
hear
me
out
,
but
came
to
me
and
folding
his
arms
about
me
,
said
,
"
Just
as
I
wished
,
have
you
answered
,
<EOS>
my
beloved
Pamela
;
I
was
never
yet
deceived
in
you
;
no
,
not
once
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Madam
,
"
said
he
to
the
countess
,
"
Lord
Davers
,
Lady
Davers
,
do
we
want
any
titles
,
think
you
,
to
make
us
happy
but
what
we
can
confer
upon
ourselves
?
"
<EOS>
And
he
pressed
my
hand
to
his
lips
,
as
he
always
honours
me
most
in
company
and
went
to
his
place
highly
pleased
;
while
his
fine
manner
drew
tears
from
my
eyes
,
and
made
his
noble
sister
's
and
the
countess
's
glisten
too
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
for
my
part
,
"
said
Lady
Davers
,
"
thou
art
<EOS>
a
strange
girl
:
<EOS>
where
,
as
my
brother
once
said
,
gottest
thou
all
this
?
"
<EOS>
Then
pleasantly
humorous
,
as
if
she
was
angry
,
she
changed
her
tone
,
"
<EOS>
What
signify
thy
meek
words
and
humble
speeches
when
by
thy
actions
,
as
well
as
sentiments
,
thou
reflectest
upon
us
all
?
<EOS>
Pamela
,
"
said
she
,
"
have
less
merit
,
or
take
care
to
conceal
it
better
:
<EOS>
I
shall
otherwise
have
no
more
patience
with
thee
,
than
thy
monarch
has
just
now
shewn
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
countess
was
pleased
to
say
,
"
You
're
a
happy
couple
indeed
!
"
  
<EOS>
Such
sort
of
entertainment
as
this
you
are
to
expect
from
your
correspondent
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
do
better
than
I
can
;
and
it
may
appear
such
a
mixture
of
self
-
praise
,
vanity
,
and
impertinence
,
that
I
expect
you
will
tell
me
freely
,
as
soon
as
this
comes
to
your
hand
,
whether
it
be
tolerable
to
you
.
<EOS>
Yet
I
must
write
on
,
for
my
dear
father
and
mother
's
sake
,
who
require
it
of
me
,
and
are
prepared
to
approve
of
every
thing
that
comes
from
me
,
for
no
other
reason
but
that
:
and
I
think
you
ought
to
leave
me
to
write
to
them
only
,
as
I
can
not
hope
it
will
be
entertaining
to
any
body
else
,
without
expecting
as
much
partiality
and
favour
from
others
,
as
I
have
from
my
dear
parents
.
<EOS>
Mean
time
I
conclude
here
my
first
conversation
-
piece
;
and
am
,
and
will
be
,
always
yours

P.B.
    
THURSDAY
MORNING
,
SIX
O'CLOCK
.
  
<EOS>
Our
breakfast
conversation
yesterday
(
at
which
only
Mrs.
Worden
,
my
lady
's
woman
,
and
my
Polly
attended
)
was
so
whimsically
particular
,
(
though
I
doubt
some
of
it
,
at
least
,
will
appear
too
trifling
)
that
I
must
acquaint
my
dear
Miss
Darnford
with
it
,
who
is
desirous
of
knowing
all
that
relates
to
Lady
Davers
's
conduct
towards
me
.
  
<EOS>
You
must
know
,
then
,
I
have
the
honour
to
stand
very
high
in
the
graces
of
Lord
Davers
,
who
on
every
occasion
is
pleased
to
call
me
his
good
Sister
,
his
dear
Sister
,
and
sometimes
his
charming
Sister
,
and
he
says
,
he
will
not
be
out
of
my
company
for
an
hour
together
,
while
he
stays
here
,
if
he
can
help
it
.
  
<EOS>
My
lady
seems
to
relish
this
very
well
in
the
main
,
though
she
can
not
quite
so
readily
,
yet
,
frame
her
mouth
to
the
sound
of
the
word
Sister
,
as
my
lord
does
;
of
which
this
that
follows
is
one
instance
.
  
<EOS>
His
lordship
had
called
me
by
that
tender
name
twice
before
,
and
saying
,
"
I
will
drink
another
dish
,
I
think
,
my
good
Sister
.
<EOS>
"
My
lady
said
,
"
Your
lordship
has
got
a
word
by
the
end
,
that
you
seem
mighty
fond
of
:
I
have
taken
notice
,
that
you
have
called
Pamela
Sister
,
Sister
,
Sister
,
no
less
than
three
times
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
.
"
  
<EOS>
My
lord
looked
a
little
serious
:
"
I
shall
one
day
,
"
said
he
,
"
be
allowed
to
choose
my
own
words
and
phrases
<EOS>
,
I
hope
 
Your
sister
,
Mr.
B.
,
"
added
he
,
"
often
questions
whether
I
am
at
age
or
not
,
though
the
House
of
Peers
made
no
scruple
of
admitting
me
among
them
some
years
ago
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
said
severely
,
but
with
a
smiling
air
,
"
'
<EOS>
Tis
<EOS>
well
she
has
such
a
gentleman
as
your
lordship
for
a
husband
,
whose
affectionate
indulgence
to
her
makes
you
overlook
all
her
saucy
sallies
!
<EOS>
I
am
sure
,
when
you
took
her
out
of
our
family
into
your
own
,
we
all
thought
ourselves
,
I
in
particular
,
bound
to
pray
for
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
thought
this
a
great
trial
of
my
lady
's
patience
:
but
it
was
from
Mr.
B.
<EOS>
And
she
said
,
with
a
half
-
pleasant
,
half
-
serious
air
,
"
How
now
,
Confidence
!
 
<EOS>
None
but
my
brother
could
have
said
this
,
whose
violent
spirit
was
always
much
more
intolerable
than
mine
:
but
I
can
tell
you
,
Mr.
B.
<EOS>
,
I
was
always
thought
very
good
-
humoured
and
obliging
to
every
body
,
till
your
impudence
came
from
college
,
and
from
your
travels
;
and
then
,
I
own
,
your
provoking
ways
made
me
now
-
and
-
then
a
little
out
of
the
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
well
,
sister
,
we
'll
have
no
more
of
this
subject
;
only
let
us
see
that
my
Lord
Davers
wants
not
his
proper
authority
with
you
,
although
you
used
to
keep
me
in
awe
formerly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Keep
you
in
awe
!
 
<EOS>
That
nobody
could
ever
do
yet
,
boy
or
man
.
<EOS>
But
,
my
lord
,
I
beg
your
pardon
;
for
this
brother
will
make
mischief
betwixt
us
if
he
can
 
<EOS>
I
only
took
notice
of
the
word
Sister
so
often
used
,
which
looked
more
like
affectation
than
affection
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
,
Lady
Davers
,
"
said
my
lord
,
gravely
,
"
I
have
two
reasons
for
using
the
word
so
frequently
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'd
be
glad
to
hear
them
,
"
said
the
dear
taunting
lady
;
"
for
I
do
n't
doubt
they
're
mighty
good
ones
.
<EOS>
What
are
they
,
my
lord
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
One
is
,
because
I
love
,
and
am
fond
of
my
new
relation
:
the
other
,
that
you
are
so
sparing
of
the
word
,
that
I
call
her
so
for
us
both
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Your
lordship
says
well
,
"
replied
Mr.
B.
,
smiling
:
"
and
<EOS>
Lady
Davers
can
give
two
reasons
why
she
does
not
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
said
my
lady
,
"
now
we
are
in
for't
<EOS>
,
let
us
hear
your
two
reasons
likewise
;
I
doubt
not
they
're
wise
ones
too
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
they
are
yours
,
Lady
Davers
,
they
must
be
so
.
<EOS>
One
is
,
That
every
condescension
(
to
speak
in
a
proud
lady
's
dialect
)
comes
with
as
much
difficulty
from
her
,
as
a
favour
from
the
House
of
Austria
to
the
petty
princes
of
Germany
.
<EOS>
The
second
,
Because
those
of
your
sex
<EOS>
(
Excuse
me
,
Madam
,
"
to
the
countess
)
"
who
have
once
made
scruples
,
think
it
inconsistent
with
themselves
to
be
over
hasty
to
alter
their
own
conduct
,
choosing
rather
to
persist
in
an
error
,
than
own
it
to
be
one
.
"
  
<EOS>
This
proceeded
from
his
impatience
to
see
me
in
the
least
slighted
by
my
lady
;
and
I
said
to
Lord
Davers
,
to
soften
matters
,
"
Never
,
my
lord
,
were
brother
and
sister
so
loving
in
earnest
,
and
yet
so
satirical
upon
each
other
in
jest
,
as
my
good
lady
and
Mr.
B.
<EOS>
But
your
lordship
knows
their
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
My
lady
frowned
at
her
brother
,
but
turned
it
off
with
an
air
:
"
I
love
the
mistress
of
this
house
,
"
said
she
,
"
very
well
;
and
am
quite
reconciled
to
her
:
but
methinks
there
is
such
a
hissing
sound
in
the
word
Sister
,
that
I
can
not
abide
it
.
'
<EOS>
Tis
a
true
English
word
,
but
a
word
I
have
not
been
used
to
,
having
never
had
a
sis
-
s
-
s
-
ter
before
,
as
you
know
,
"
 
Speaking
the
first
syllable
of
the
word
with
an
emphatical
hiss
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
said
,
"
Observe
you
not
,
Lady
Davers
,
that
you
used
a
word
(
to
avoid
that
)
which
had
twice
the
hissing
in
it
that
sister
has
?
<EOS>
And
that
was
mis
-
s
-
s
-
tress
,
with
two
other
hissing
words
to
accompany
it
,
of
this
-
s
-
s
hous
-
s
-
e
:
<EOS>
but
to
what
childish
follies
does
not
pride
make
one
stoop
!
 
<EOS>
Excuse
,
Madam
"
(
to
the
countess
)
,
"
such
poor
low
conversation
as
we
are
dwindled
into
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
O
Sir
,
"
said
her
ladyship
,
"
the
conversation
is
very
agreeable
;
 
and
I
think
,
Lady
Davers
,
you
're
fairly
caught
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
said
my
lady
,
"
then
help
me
,
good
sister
 
<EOS>
there
's
for
you
!
 
<EOS>
to
a
little
sugar
.
<EOS>
Will
that
please
you
,
Sir
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
always
pleased
,
"
replied
her
brother
,
smiling
,
"
when
Lady
Davers
acts
up
to
her
own
character
,
and
the
good
sense
she
is
mistress
of
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
ay
,
my
good
brother
,
like
other
wise
men
,
takes
it
for
granted
that
it
is
a
mark
of
good
sense
to
approve
of
whatever
he
does
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
,
for
this
one
time
,
I
am
a
very
sensible
body
with
him
 
<EOS>
And
I
'll
leave
off
,
while
I
have
his
good
word
.
<EOS>
Only
one
thing
I
must
say
to
you
,
my
dear
,
"
turning
to
me
,
"
that
though
I
call
you
Pamela
,
as
I
please
,
be
assured
,
I
love
you
as
well
as
if
I
called
you
sister
,
as
Lord
Davers
does
,
at
every
word
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Your
ladyship
gives
me
great
pleasure
,
"
said
I
,
"
in
this
kind
assurance
;
and
I
do
n't
doubt
<EOS>
but
I
shall
have
the
honour
of
being
called
by
that
tender
name
,
if
I
can
be
so
happy
as
to
deserve
it
;
and
I
'll
lose
no
opportunity
that
shall
be
afforded
me
,
to
show
how
sincerely
I
will
endeavour
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
was
pleased
to
rise
from
her
seat
:
"
Give
me
a
kiss
,
my
dear
girl
;
you
deserve
every
thing
:
and
permit
me
to
say
Pamela
sometimes
,
as
the
word
occurs
:
for
I
am
not
used
to
speak
in
print
;
and
I
will
call
you
sister
when
I
think
of
it
,
and
love
you
as
well
as
ever
sister
loved
another
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
These
proud
and
passionate
folks
,
"
said
Mr.
B.
,
"
how
good
they
can
be
,
when
they
reflect
a
little
on
what
becomes
their
characters
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
So
,
then
,
"
rejoined
my
lady
,
"
I
am
to
have
no
merit
of
my
own
,
I
see
,
do
what
I
will
.
<EOS>
This
is
not
quite
so
generous
in
my
brother
,
as
one
might
expect
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
you
saucy
sister
 
excuse
me
.
<EOS>
Lord
Davers
 
<EOS>
what
merit
would
you
assume
?
<EOS>
Can
people
merit
by
doing
their
duty
?
<EOS>
And
is
it
so
great
a
praise
,
that
you
think
fit
to
own
for
a
sister
so
deserving
a
girl
as
this
,
whom
I
take
pride
in
calling
my
wife
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thou
art
<EOS>
what
thou
always
wert
,
"
returned
my
lady
;
"
and
were
I
in
this
my
imputed
pride
to
want
an
excuse
,
I
know
not
the
creature
living
,
that
ought
so
soon
to
make
one
for
me
,
as
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
excuse
you
,
"
said
he
,
"
for
that
very
reason
,
if
you
please
:
<EOS>
but
it
little
becomes
either
your
pride
,
or
mine
,
to
do
any
thing
that
wants
excuse
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mighty
moral
!
<EOS>
mighty
grave
,
truly
!
 
<EOS>
Pamela
,
friend
,
sister
,
 
there
's
for
you
!
 
<EOS>
thou
art
a
happy
girl
to
have
made
such
a
reformation
in
thy
honest
man
's
way
of
thinking
as
well
as
acting
.
<EOS>
But
now
we
are
upon
this
topic
,
and
only
friends
about
us
,
I
am
resolved
to
be
even
with
thee
,
brother
 
Jackey
,
if
you
are
not
for
another
dish
,
I
wish
you
'd
withdraw
.
<EOS>
Polly
Barlow
,
we
do
n't
want
you
.
<EOS>
Beck
,
you
may
stay
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
H.
obeyed
;
and
Polly
went
out
;
for
you
must
know
,
Miss
,
that
my
Lady
Davers
will
have
none
of
the
men
-
fellows
,
as
she
calls
them
,
to
attend
upon
us
at
tea
.
<EOS>
And
I
can
not
say
<EOS>
but
I
think
her
entirely
in
the
right
,
for
several
reasons
that
might
be
given
.
  
<EOS>
When
they
were
withdrawn
,
my
lady
repeated
,
"
Now
we
are
upon
this
topic
of
reclaiming
and
reformation
,
tell
me
,
thou
bold
wretch
;
for
you
know
I
have
seen
all
your
rogueries
in
Pamela
's
papers
;
tell
me
,
if
ever
rake
but
thyself
made
such
an
attempt
as
thou
didst
,
on
this
dear
good
girl
,
in
presence
of
a
virtuous
woman
,
as
Mrs.
Jervis
was
always
noted
to
be
?
<EOS>
As
to
the
other
vile
creature
,
Jewkes
,
'
tis
less
wonder
,
although
in
that
thou
hadst
the
impudence
of
him
who
set
thee
to
work
:
but
to
make
thy
attempt
before
Mrs.
Jervis
,
and
in
spite
of
her
struggles
and
reproaches
,
was
the
very
stretch
of
shameless
wickedness
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
seemed
a
little
disconcerted
,
and
said
,
"
Surely
,
Lady
Davers
,
this
is
going
too
far
!
<EOS>
Look
at
Pamela
's
blushing
face
,
and
downcast
eye
,
and
wonder
at
yourself
for
this
question
,
as
much
as
you
do
at
me
for
the
action
you
speak
of
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
countess
said
to
me
,
"
My
dear
Mrs.
B.
,
I
wonder
not
at
this
sweet
confusion
on
so
affecting
a
question
!
 
<EOS>
but
,
indeed
,
since
it
is
come
in
so
naturally
,
I
must
say
,
Mr.
B.
,
that
we
have
all
,
and
my
daughters
too
,
wondered
at
this
,
more
than
at
any
part
of
your
attempts
;
because
,
Sir
,
we
thought
you
one
of
the
most
civilized
men
in
England
,
and
that
you
could
not
but
wish
to
have
saved
appearances
at
least
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Though
this
is
to
you
,
my
Pamela
,
the
renewal
of
griefs
;
yet
hold
up
your
dear
face
.
<EOS>
You
may
 
<EOS>
The
triumph
was
yours
 
<EOS>
the
shame
and
the
blushes
ought
to
be
mine
 
<EOS>
And
I
will
humour
my
saucy
sister
in
all
<EOS>
she
would
have
me
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nay
,
"
said
Lady
Davers
,
"
you
know
the
question
;
I
can
not
put
it
stronger
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
very
true
,
"
replied
he
:
"
<EOS>
But
would
you
expect
I
should
give
you
a
reason
for
an
attempt
that
appears
to
you
so
very
shocking
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
Sir
,
"
said
the
countess
,
"
do
n't
say
appears
to
Lady
Davers
;
for
(
excuse
me
)
it
will
appear
so
to
every
one
who
hears
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
my
brother
is
too
hardly
used
,
"
said
Lord
Davers
;
"
he
has
made
all
the
amends
he
could
make
:
 
and
you
,
my
sister
,
who
were
the
person
offended
,
forgive
him
now
,
I
hope
;
do
n't
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
could
not
answer
;
for
I
was
quite
confounded
;
and
made
a
motion
to
withdraw
:
but
Mr.
B.
said
,
"
Do
n't
go
,
my
dear
:
though
I
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
an
action
set
before
me
in
so
full
a
glare
,
in
presence
of
Lord
Davers
and
the
countess
;
yet
I
will
not
have
you
stir
because
I
forget
how
you
represented
it
,
and
you
must
tell
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
,
Sir
,
I
can
not
,
"
said
I
;
"
pray
,
my
dear
ladies
 
pray
,
my
good
lord
 
<EOS>
and
,
dear
Sir
,
do
n't
thus
renew
my
griefs
,
as
you
were
pleased
justly
to
phrase
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
the
representation
of
that
scene
in
my
pocket
,
"
said
my
lady
;
"
for
I
was
resolved
,
as
I
told
Lady
Betty
,
to
shame
the
wicked
wretch
with
it
the
first
opportunity
;
and
I
'll
read
it
to
you
;
or
rather
,
you
shall
read
it
yourself
,
Bold
-
face
,
if
you
can
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
So
she
pulled
those
leaves
out
of
her
pocket
,
wrapped
up
carefully
in
a
paper
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Here
,
 
I
believe
he
who
could
act
thus
,
must
read
it
;
and
,
to
spare
Pamela
's
confusion
,
read
it
to
yourself
;
for
we
all
know
how
it
was
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
"
said
he
,
taking
the
papers
,
"
I
can
say
something
to
abate
the
heinousness
of
this
heavy
charge
,
or
else
I
should
not
stand
thus
at
the
insolent
bar
of
my
sister
,
answering
her
interrogatories
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
send
you
,
my
dear
Miss
Darnford
,
a
transcript
of
the
charge
.
<EOS>
To
be
sure
,
you
'll
say
,
he
was
a
very
wicked
man
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
read
it
to
himself
,
and
said
,
"
This
is
a
dark
affair
,
as
here
stated
;
and
I
ca
n't
say
,
but
Pamela
,
and
Mrs.
Jervis
too
,
had
great
reason
to
apprehend
the
worst
:
but
surely
readers
of
it
,
who
were
less
parties
in
the
supposed
attempt
,
and
not
determined
at
all
events
to
condemn
me
,
might
have
made
a
more
favourable
construction
for
me
,
than
you
,
Lady
Davers
,
have
done
in
the
strong
light
in
which
you
have
set
this
heinous
matter
before
us
.
  
<EOS>
"
However
,
since
my
lady
,
"
bowing
to
the
countess
,
"
and
Lord
Davers
seem
to
expect
me
particularly
to
answer
this
black
charge
,
I
will
,
at
a
proper
time
,
if
agreeable
,
give
you
a
brief
history
of
my
passion
for
this
dear
girl
;
how
it
commenced
and
increased
,
and
my
own
struggles
with
it
,
and
this
will
introduce
,
with
some
little
advantage
to
myself
perhaps
,
what
I
have
to
say
,
as
to
this
supposed
attempt
:
and
at
the
same
time
enable
you
the
better
to
account
for
some
facts
which
you
have
read
in
my
pretty
accuser
's
papers
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
pleased
every
one
,
and
they
begged
him
to
begin
then
;
but
he
said
,
it
was
time
we
should
think
of
dressing
,
the
morning
being
far
advanced
;
and
if
no
company
came
in
,
he
would
,
in
the
afternoon
,
give
them
the
particulars
they
desired
to
hear
.
  
<EOS>
The
three
gentlemen
rode
out
,
and
returned
to
dress
before
dinner
:
my
lady
and
the
countess
also
took
an
airing
in
the
chariot
.
<EOS>
Just
as
they
returned
,
compliments
came
from
several
of
the
neighbouring
ladies
to
our
noble
guests
,
on
their
arrival
in
these
parts
;
and
to
as
many
as
sent
,
Lady
Davers
desired
their
companies
for
to
-
morrow
afternoon
,
to
tea
;
but
Mr.
B.
having
fallen
in
with
some
of
the
gentlemen
likewise
,
he
told
me
,
we
should
have
most
of
our
visiting
neighbours
at
dinner
,
and
desired
Mrs.
Jervis
might
prepare
accordingly
for
them
.
  
<EOS>
After
dinner
Mr.
H.
took
a
ride
out
,
attended
by
Mr.
Colbrand
,
of
whom
he
is
very
fond
,
ever
since
he
frightened
Lady
Davers
's
footmen
at
the
Hall
,
threatening
to
chine
them
,
if
they
offered
to
stop
his
lady
:
for
,
he
says
,
he
loves
a
man
of
courage
:
very
probably
knowing
his
own
defects
that
way
,
for
my
lady
often
calls
him
a
chicken
-
hearted
fellow
.
<EOS>
And
then
Lord
and
Lady
Davers
,
and
the
countess
,
revived
the
subject
of
the
morning
;
and
Mr.
B.
was
pleased
to
begin
in
the
manner
I
shall
mention
by
-
and
-
bye
.
<EOS>
For
here
I
am
obliged
to
break
off
.
  
<EOS>
Now
,
my
dear
Miss
Darnford
,
I
will
proceed
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
began
,
"
said
Mr.
B.
,
"
very
early
to
take
notice
of
this
lovely
girl
,
even
when
she
was
hardly
thirteen
years
old
;
for
her
charms
increased
every
day
,
not
only
in
my
eye
,
but
in
the
eyes
of
all
who
beheld
her
.
<EOS>
My
mother
,
as
you
(
Lady
Davers
)
know
,
took
the
greatest
delight
in
her
,
always
calling
her
,
<EOS>
her
Pamela
,
her
good
child
:
and
her
waiting
-
maid
and
her
cabinet
of
rarities
were
her
boasts
,
and
equally
shewn
to
every
visitor
:
for
besides
the
beauty
of
her
figure
,
and
the
genteel
air
of
her
person
,
the
dear
girl
had
a
surprising
memory
,
<EOS>
a
solidity
of
judgment
above
her
years
,
and
a
docility
so
unequalled
,
that
she
took
all
parts
of
learning
which
her
lady
,
as
fond
of
instructing
her
as
she
of
improving
by
instruction
,
crowded
upon
her
;
insomuch
that
she
had
masters
to
teach
her
to
dance
,
sing
,
and
play
on
the
spinnet
,
whom
she
every
day
surprised
by
the
readiness
wherewith
she
took
every
thing
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
remember
once
,
my
mother
praising
her
girl
before
me
,
and
my
aunt
B.
(
who
is
since
dead
)
,
I
could
not
but
notice
her
fondness
for
her
,
and
said
,
"
What
do
you
design
,
Madam
,
to
do
with
or
for
,
this
Pamela
of
yours
?
<EOS>
The
accomplishments
you
give
her
will
do
her
more
hurt
than
good
;
for
they
will
set
her
so
much
above
her
degree
,
that
what
you
intend
as
a
kindness
,
may
prove
her
ruin
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
aunt
joined
with
me
,
and
spoke
in
a
still
stronger
manner
against
giving
her
such
an
education
:
and
added
,
as
I
well
remember
,
"
Surely
,
sister
,
you
do
wrong
.
<EOS>
One
would
think
,
if
one
knew
not
my
nephew
's
discreet
pride
,
that
you
design
her
for
something
more
than
your
own
waiting
-
maid
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
"
Ah
!
sister
,
"
said
the
old
lady
,
"
there
is
no
fear
of
what
you
hint
at
;
his
family
pride
,
and
stately
temper
,
will
secure
my
son
:
he
has
too
much
of
his
father
in
him
.
<EOS>
And
as
for
Pamela
,
you
know
not
the
girl
.
<EOS>
She
has
always
in
her
thoughts
,
and
in
her
mouth
,
too
,
her
parents
"
mean
condition
,
and
I
shall
do
nothing
for
them
,
at
least
at
present
,
though
they
are
honest
folks
,
and
deserve
well
,
because
I
will
keep
the
girl
humble
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
"
But
what
can
I
do
with
the
little
baggage
?
"
continued
my
mother
;
"
she
conquers
every
thing
so
fast
,
and
has
such
a
thirst
after
knowledge
,
and
the
more
she
knows
,
I
verily
think
,
the
humbler
she
is
,
that
I
can
not
help
letting
go
,
as
my
son
,
when
a
little
boy
,
used
to
do
to
his
kite
,
as
fast
as
she
pulls
;
and
to
what
height
she
'll
soar
,
I
ca
n't
tell
.
  
"
<EOS>
"
I
intended
,
"
proceeded
the
good
lady
,
"
at
first
,
only
to
make
her
mistress
of
some
fine
needle
-
work
,
to
qualify
her
(
as
she
has
a
delicacy
in
her
person
,
that
makes
it
a
pity
ever
to
put
her
to
hard
work
)
for
a
genteel
place
;
but
she
masters
that
so
fast
,
that
now
as
my
daughter
is
married
and
gone
from
me
,
I
am
desirous
to
qualify
her
to
divert
and
entertain
me
in
my
thoughtful
hours
:
and
were
you
,
sister
,
to
know
what
she
is
capable
of
,
and
how
diverting
her
innocent
prattle
is
to
me
,
and
her
natural
simplicity
,
which
I
encourage
her
to
preserve
amidst
all
she
learns
,
you
would
not
,
nor
my
son
neither
,
wonder
at
the
pleasure
I
take
in
her
.
<EOS>
Shall
I
call
her
in
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
"
I
do
n't
want
,
"
said
I
,
"
to
have
the
girl
called
in
:
if
you
,
Madam
,
are
diverted
with
her
,
that
's
enough
.
<EOS>
To
be
sure
,
Pamela
is
a
better
companion
for
a
lady
,
than
a
monkey
or
a
harlequin
:
<EOS>
but
I
fear
you
'll
set
her
above
herself
,
and
make
her
vain
and
pert
;
and
that
,
at
last
,
in
order
to
support
her
pride
,
she
may
fall
into
temptations
which
may
be
fatal
to
herself
,
and
others
too
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
"
I
'm
glad
to
hear
this
from
my
son
,
"
replied
the
good
lady
.
"
<EOS>
But
the
moment
I
see
my
favour
puffs
her
up
<EOS>
,
I
shall
take
other
measures
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
"
Well
,
"
thought
I
to
myself
,
"
I
only
want
to
conceal
my
views
from
your
penetrating
eye
,
my
good
mother
;
and
I
shall
one
day
take
as
much
delight
in
your
girl
,
and
her
accomplishments
,
as
you
now
do
;
so
go
on
,
and
improve
her
as
fast
as
you
will
.
<EOS>
I
'll
only
now
and
then
talk
against
her
,
to
blind
you
;
and
doubt
not
that
all
you
do
will
qualify
her
the
better
for
my
purpose
.
<EOS>
Only
,
"
thought
I
,
"
fly
swiftly
on
,
two
or
three
more
tardy
years
,
and
I
'll
nip
this
bud
by
the
time
it
begins
to
open
,
and
place
it
in
my
bosom
for
a
year
or
two
at
least
:
for
so
long
,
<EOS>
if
the
girl
behaves
worthy
of
her
education
,
I
doubt
not
,
she
'll
be
new
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
Excuse
me
,
ladies
;
 
excuse
me
,
Lord
Davers
;
 
if
I
am
not
ingenuous
,
I
had
better
be
silent
.
<EOS>
"
  
I
will
not
interrupt
this
affecting
narration
,
by
mentioning
my
own
alternate
blushes
,
confusions
,
and
exclamations
,
as
the
naughty
man
went
on
;
nor
the
censures
,
and
many
Out
upon
you
's
of
the
attentive
ladies
,
and
Fie
,
brother
's
,
of
Lord
Davers
;
nor
yet
with
apologies
for
the
praises
on
myself
,
so
frequently
intermingled
 
contenting
myself
to
give
you
,
as
near
as
I
can
recollect
,
the
very
sentences
of
the
dear
relator
.
<EOS>
And
as
to
our
occasional
exclaimings
and
observations
,
you
may
suppose
what
they
were
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
,
"
continued
Mr.
B.
,
"
I
went
on
dropping
hints
against
her
now
and
then
;
and
whenever
I
met
her
in
the
passages
about
the
house
,
or
in
the
garden
,
avoiding
to
look
at
,
or
to
speak
to
her
,
as
she
passed
me
,
curtseying
,
and
putting
on
a
thousand
bewitching
airs
of
obligingness
and
reverence
;
while
I
(
who
thought
the
best
way
to
demolish
the
influence
of
such
an
education
,
would
be
not
to
alarm
her
fears
on
one
hand
,
or
to
familiarize
myself
to
her
on
the
other
,
till
I
came
to
strike
the
blow
)
<EOS>
looked
haughty
and
reserved
,
and
passed
by
her
with
a
stiff
nod
at
most
.
<EOS>
Or
,
if
I
spoke
,
"
How
does
your
lady
this
morning
,
girl
?
 
<EOS>
I
hope
she
rested
well
last
night
:
"
then
,
covered
with
blushes
,
and
curtseying
at
every
word
,
as
if
she
thought
herself
unworthy
of
answering
my
questions
,
she
'd
trip
away
in
a
kind
of
confusion
,
as
soon
as
she
had
spoken
.
<EOS>
And
once
I
heard
her
say
to
Mrs.
Jervis
,
"
Dear
Sirs
,
my
young
master
spoke
to
me
,
and
called
me
by
my
name
,
saying
 
How
slept
your
lady
last
night
,
Pamela
?
 
<EOS>
Was
not
that
very
good
,
Mrs.
Jervis
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
"
thought
I
,
"
I
am
in
the
right
way
,
I
find
:
this
will
do
in
proper
time
.
<EOS>
Go
on
,
my
dear
mother
,
improving
as
fast
as
you
will
:
I
'll
engage
to
pull
down
in
three
hours
,
what
you
'll
be
building
up
in
as
many
years
,
in
spite
of
all
the
lessons
you
can
teach
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
'
Tis
enough
for
me
,
that
I
am
establishing
in
you
,
ladies
,
and
in
you
,
my
lord
,
a
higher
esteem
for
my
Pamela
(
I
am
but
too
sensible
I
shall
lose
a
good
deal
of
my
own
reputation
)
in
the
relation
I
am
now
giving
you
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
dressed
,
grew
more
confident
,
and
as
insolent
withal
,
as
if
,
though
I
had
not
Lady
Davers
's
wit
and
virtue
,
I
had
all
her
spirit
(
excuse
me
,
Lady
Davers
;
)
and
having
a
pretty
bold
heart
,
which
rather
put
me
upon
courting
than
avoiding
a
danger
or
difficulty
,
I
had
but
too
much
my
way
with
every
body
;
and
many
a
menaced
complaint
<EOS>
have
I
looked
down
,
with
a
haughty
air
,
and
a
promptitude
,
like
that
of
Colbrand
's
to
your
footmen
at
the
Hall
,
to
clap
my
hand
to
my
side
;
which
was
of
the
greater
service
to
my
bold
enterprise
,
as
two
or
three
gentlemen
had
found
I
knew
how
to
be
in
earnest
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Ha
!
"
said
my
lady
,
"
thou
wast
ever
an
impudent
fellow
:
and
<EOS>
many
a
vile
roguery
have
I
kept
from
my
poor
mother
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
,
to
my
knowledge
,
she
thought
you
no
saint
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
poor
lady
,
"
continued
he
,
"
she
used
now
-
and
-
then
to
catechize
me
;
and
was
sure
I
was
not
so
good
as
I
ought
to
be
:
 
"
<EOS>
For
,
son
,
"
she
would
cry
,
"
these
late
hours
,
these
all
night
works
,
and
to
come
home
<EOS>
so
sober
can
not
be
right.-I'm
not
sure
,
if
I
were
to
know
all
,
(
and
yet
I
'm
afraid
of
inquiring
after
your
ways
)
whether
I
should
not
have
reason
to
wish
you
were
brought
home
in
wine
,
rather
than
to
come
in
so
sober
,
and
so
late
,
as
you
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Once
,
I
remember
,
in
the
summer
-
time
,
I
came
home
about
six
in
the
morning
,
and
met
the
good
lady
unexpectedly
by
the
garden
back
-
door
,
of
which
I
had
a
key
to
let
myself
in
at
all
hours
.
<EOS>
I
started
,
and
would
have
avoided
her
:
but
she
called
me
to
her
,
and
then
I
approached
her
with
an
air
,
"
What
brings
you
,
Madam
,
into
the
garden
at
so
early
an
hour
?
"
<EOS>
turning
my
face
from
her
;
for
I
had
a
few
scratches
on
my
forehead
 
with
a
thorn
,
or
so
 
which
I
feared
she
would
be
more
inquisitive
about
than
I
cared
she
should
.
  
<EOS>
"
"
And
what
makes
you
,
"
said
she
,
"
so
early
here
,
Billy
?
 
<EOS>
What
a
rakish
figure
dost
thou
make
!
 
<EOS>
One
time
or
other
these
courses
will
yield
you
but
little
comfort
,
on
reflection
:
would
to
God
thou
wast
but
happily
married
!
"
  
"
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
So
,
Madam
,
the
old
wish
!
 
<EOS>
I
'm
not
so
bad
as
you
think
me
:
 
<EOS>
I
hope
I
have
not
merited
so
great
a
punishment
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
These
hints
I
give
,
not
as
matter
of
glory
,
but
shame
:
<EOS>
yet
I
ought
to
tell
you
all
the
truth
,
or
nothing
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Meantime
,
"
thought
I
,
(
for
I
used
to
have
some
compunction
for
my
vile
practices
,
when
cool
reflection
,
brought
on
by
satiety
,
had
taken
hold
of
me
)
<EOS>
"
I
wish
this
sweet
girl
was
grown
to
years
of
susceptibility
,
that
I
might
reform
this
wicked
course
of
life
,
and
not
prowl
about
,
disturbing
honest
folks
"
peace
,
and
endangering
myself
.
"
<EOS>
And
as
I
had
,
by
a
certain
very
daring
and
wicked
attempt
,
in
which
,
however
,
I
did
not
succeed
,
set
a
hornet
's
nest
about
my
ears
,
which
I
began
to
apprehend
would
sting
me
to
death
,
having
once
escaped
an
ambush
by
dint
of
mere
good
luck
;
I
thought
it
better
to
remove
the
seat
of
my
warfare
into
another
kingdom
,
and
to
be
a
little
more
discreet
for
the
future
in
my
amours
.
<EOS>
So
I
went
to
France
a
second
time
,
and
passed
a
year
there
in
the
best
of
company
,
and
with
some
improvement
both
to
my
morals
and
understanding
;
and
had
a
very
few
sallies
,
considering
my
love
of
intrigue
,
and
the
ample
means
I
had
to
prosecute
successfully
all
the
desires
of
my
heart
.
  
<EOS>
"
When
I
returned
,
several
matches
were
proposed
to
me
,
and
my
good
mother
often
requested
me
to
make
her
so
happy
,
as
she
called
it
,
as
to
see
me
married
before
she
died
;
but
I
could
not
endure
the
thoughts
of
the
state
:
for
I
never
saw
a
lady
whose
temper
and
education
I
liked
,
or
with
whom
I
thought
I
could
live
tolerably
.
<EOS>
She
used
in
vain
therefore
to
plead
family
reasons
to
me
:
 
like
most
young
fellows
,
I
was
too
much
a
self
-
lover
,
to
pay
so
great
a
regard
to
posterity
;
and
,
to
say
truth
,
had
little
solicitude
at
that
time
,
whether
my
name
were
continued
or
not
,
in
my
own
descendants
.
<EOS>
However
,
I
looked
upon
my
mother
's
Pamela
with
no
small
pleasure
,
and
I
found
her
so
much
improved
,
as
well
in
person
as
behaviour
,
<EOS>
that
I
had
the
less
inducement
either
to
renew
my
intriguing
life
,
or
to
think
of
a
married
state
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yet
,
as
my
mother
had
all
her
eyes
about
her
,
as
the
phrase
is
,
I
affected
great
shyness
,
both
before
her
,
and
to
the
girl
;
for
I
doubted
not
,
my
very
looks
would
be
watched
by
them
both
;
and
what
the
one
discovered
would
not
be
a
secret
to
the
other
;
and
laying
myself
open
too
early
to
a
suspicion
<EOS>
,
I
thought
,
would
but
ice
the
girl
over
,
and
make
her
lady
more
watchful
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
I
used
to
go
into
my
mother
's
apartment
,
and
come
out
of
it
,
without
taking
the
least
notice
of
her
,
but
put
on
stiff
airs
;
and
as
she
always
withdrew
when
I
came
in
,
I
never
made
any
pretence
to
keep
her
there
.
  
<EOS>
"
Once
,
indeed
,
my
mother
,
on
my
looking
after
her
,
when
her
back
was
turned
,
said
,
"
My
dear
son
,
I
do
n't
like
your
eye
following
my
girl
so
intently
.
 
<EOS>
Only
I
know
that
sparkling
lustre
natural
to
it
,
or
I
should
have
some
fear
for
my
Pamela
,
as
she
grows
older
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
"
I
look
after
her
.
<EOS>
Madam!-My
eyes
sparkle
at
such
a
girl
as
that
!
<EOS>
No
indeed
!
<EOS>
She
may
be
your
favourite
as
a
waiting
-
maid
;
but
I
see
nothing
but
clumsy
curtseys
and
awkward
airs
about
her
.
<EOS>
A
little
rustic
affectation
of
innocence
,
that
to
such
as
can
not
see
into
her
,
may
pass
well
enough
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
"
Nay
,
my
dear
,
"
replied
my
mother
,
"
do
n't
say
that
,
of
all
things
.
<EOS>
She
has
no
affectation
,
I
am
sure
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
"
Yes
,
she
has
,
in
my
eye
,
Madam
,
and
I
'll
tell
you
how
it
is
;
you
have
taught
her
to
assume
the
airs
of
a
gentlewoman
,
to
dance
,
and
to
enter
a
room
with
a
grace
;
and
yet
bid
her
keep
her
low
birth
and
family
in
view
:
and
between
the
one
character
,
which
she
wants
to
get
into
,
and
the
other
she
dares
not
get
out
of
,
she
trips
up
and
down
mincingly
,
and
knows
not
how
to
set
her
feet
:
<EOS>
so
'
tis
the
same
in
every
gesture
:
her
arms
<EOS>
she
knows
not
whether
to
swim
with
,
or
to
hold
before
her
,
nor
whether
to
hold
her
head
up
or
down
;
and
so
does
neither
,
but
hangs
it
on
one
side
:
<EOS>
a
little
awkward
piece
of
one
-
and
-
t'other
<EOS>
I
think
her
.
<EOS>
And
,
indeed
,
you
'd
do
the
girl
more
kindness
to
put
her
into
your
dairy
,
than
to
keep
her
about
your
person
;
for
she
'll
be
utterly
spoiled
,
I
doubt
,
for
any
useful
purpose
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
son
!
<EOS>
"
said
she
,
"
I
fear
,
by
your
description
,
you
have
minded
her
too
much
in
one
sense
,
though
not
enough
in
another
.
'
<EOS>
Tis
not
my
intention
to
recommend
her
to
your
notice
,
of
all
men
;
and
I
doubt
not
,
if
it
please
God
I
live
,
and
she
continues
a
good
girl
,
but
she
will
make
a
man
of
some
middling
,
genteel
business
,
very
happy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Pamela
came
in
just
then
,
with
an
air
so
natural
,
so
humble
,
and
yet
so
much
above
herself
,
that
I
was
forced
to
turn
my
head
from
her
,
lest
my
mother
should
watch
my
eye
again
,
and
I
be
inclined
to
do
her
that
justice
,
which
my
heart
assented
to
,
but
which
my
lips
had
just
before
denied
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
All
my
difficulty
,
in
apprehension
,
was
my
good
mother
;
the
effect
of
whose
lessons
to
her
girl
,
I
was
not
so
much
afraid
of
as
her
vigilance
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
For
,
"
thought
I
,
"
I
see
by
the
delicacy
of
her
person
,
the
brilliancy
of
her
eye
,
and
the
sweet
apprehensiveness
that
plays
about
every
feature
of
her
face
,
she
must
have
tinder
enough
in
her
constitution
,
to
catch
a
well
-
struck
spark
;
and
I
'll
warrant
I
shall
know
how
to
set
her
in
a
blaze
,
in
a
few
months
more
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yet
I
wanted
,
as
I
passed
,
to
catch
her
attention
too
:
<EOS>
I
expected
her
to
turn
after
me
,
and
look
so
as
to
shew
a
liking
towards
me
;
for
I
had
a
great
opinion
of
my
person
and
air
,
which
had
been
fortunately
distinguished
by
the
ladies
,
whom
,
of
course
,
my
vanity
made
me
allow
to
be
very
good
judges
of
these
outward
advantages
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
to
my
great
disappointment
,
Pamela
never
,
by
any
favourable
glance
,
gave
the
least
encouragement
to
my
vanity
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
"
thought
I
,
"
this
girl
has
certainly
nothing
ethereal
in
her
mould
:
all
unanimated
clay
!
 
<EOS>
But
the
dancing
and
singing
airs
my
mother
is
teaching
her
,
will
better
qualify
her
in
time
,
and
another
year
will
ripen
her
into
my
arms
,
no
doubt
of
it
.
<EOS>
Let
me
only
go
on
thus
,
and
make
her
fear
me
:
that
will
enhance
in
her
mind
every
favour
I
shall
afterwards
vouchsafe
to
shew
her
:
and
never
question
old
humdrum
Virtue
,
"
thought
I
,
"
but
the
tempter
without
,
and
the
tempter
within
,
will
be
too
many
for
the
perversest
nicety
that
ever
the
sex
boasted
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yet
,
though
I
could
not
once
attract
her
eye
towards
me
,
she
never
failed
to
draw
mine
after
her
,
whenever
she
went
by
me
,
or
wherever
I
saw
her
,
except
,
as
I
said
,
in
my
mother
's
presence
;
and
particularly
when
she
had
passed
me
,
and
could
not
see
me
look
at
her
,
without
turning
her
head
,
as
I
expected
so
often
from
her
in
vain
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
wonder
,
Lord
Davers
,
who
,
I
suppose
,
was
once
in
love
,
or
you
'd
never
have
married
such
an
hostile
spirit
as
my
sister
's
there-
<EOS>
"
  
"
Go
on
,
sauce
 
box
,
"
said
she
,
"
I
wo
n't
interrupt
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
wonder
how
I
could
behave
so
coolly
as
to
escape
all
discovery
so
long
from
a
lady
so
watchful
as
my
mother
,
and
from
the
apprehensiveness
of
the
girl
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
to
say
nothing
of
her
tender
years
,
and
that
my
love
was
not
of
this
bashful
sort
,
I
was
not
absolutely
determined
,
so
great
was
my
pride
,
that
I
ought
to
think
her
worthy
of
being
my
mistress
,
when
I
had
not
much
reason
,
as
I
thought
,
to
despair
of
prevailing
upon
persons
of
higher
birth
(
were
I
disposed
to
try
)
to
live
with
me
upon
my
own
terms
.
<EOS>
My
pride
,
therefore
,
kept
my
passion
at
bay
,
as
I
may
say
:
so
far
was
I
from
imagining
I
should
ever
be
brought
to
what
has
since
happened
!
<EOS>
But
to
proceed
:
  
"
Hitherto
my
mind
was
taken
up
with
the
beauties
of
her
person
only
.
<EOS>
My
EYE
had
drawn
my
HEART
after
it
,
without
giving
myself
any
trouble
about
that
sense
and
judgment
which
my
mother
was
always
praising
in
her
Pamela
,
as
exceeding
her
years
and
opportunities
:
but
an
occasion
happened
,
which
,
though
slight
in
itself
,
took
the
HEAD
into
the
party
,
and
I
thought
of
her
,
young
as
she
was
,
with
a
distinction
,
<EOS>
that
before
I
had
not
for
her
.
<EOS>
It
was
this
:
  
"
Being
with
my
mother
in
her
closet
,
who
was
talking
to
me
on
the
old
subject
,
matrimony
<EOS>
,
I
saw
Pamela
's
commonplace
book
,
as
I
may
call
it
;
in
which
,
by
her
lady
's
direction
,
from
time
to
time
,
she
had
transcribed
from
the
Bible
,
and
other
good
books
,
such
passages
as
most
impressed
her
as
she
read
 
A
method
<EOS>
,
I
take
it
,
my
dear
"
(
turning
to
me
)
,
"
of
great
service
to
you
,
as
it
initiated
you
into
writing
with
that
freedom
and
ease
,
which
shine
in
your
saucy
letters
and
journals
;
and
to
which
my
present
fetters
are
not
a
little
owing
:
just
as
pedlars
catch
monkeys
in
the
baboon
kingdoms
,
provoking
the
attentive
fools
,
by
their
own
example
,
to
put
on
shoes
and
stockings
,
till
the
apes
of
imitation
,
trying
to
do
the
like
,
entangle
their
feet
,
and
so
can
not
escape
upon
the
boughs
of
the
tree
of
liberty
,
on
which
before
they
were
wo
nt
to
hop
and
skip
about
,
and
play
a
thousand
puggish
tricks
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
observed
the
girl
wrote
a
pretty
hand
,
and
very
swift
and
free
;
and
affixed
her
points
or
stops
with
so
much
judgment
(
her
years
considered
)
,
that
I
began
to
have
an
high
opinion
of
her
understanding
.
<EOS>
Some
observations
likewise
upon
several
of
the
passages
were
so
just
and
solid
,
that
I
could
not
help
being
tacitly
surprised
at
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
mother
watched
my
eye
,
and
was
silent
:
I
seemed
not
to
observe
that
she
did
;
and
after
a
while
,
laid
down
the
book
,
shutting
it
with
great
indifference
,
and
talking
of
another
subject
.
  
<EOS>
"
Upon
this
,
my
mother
said
,
"
Do
n't
you
think
Pamela
writes
a
pretty
hand
,
son
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
"
I
did
not
mind
it
much
,
"
said
I
,
with
a
careless
air
.
<EOS>
"
This
is
her
writing
,
is
it
?
"
taking
the
book
,
and
opening
it
again
,
at
a
place
of
Scripture
.
<EOS>
"
The
girl
is
mighty
pious
!
"
said
I.
  
"
"
I
wish
you
were
so
,
child

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
"
I
wish
so
too

if
it
would

I

so

<EOS>
"
"
So
do
I
,
Madam
;

and
down
I
laid
the
book
again
very
carelessly
.
  
"
"
<EOS>
Look
once
more
in
it
,
"
said
she
,
"
and
see
if
you
ca
n't
open
it
upon
some
place
that
may
strike
you

<EOS>

I
opened
it
at

I

I
,

good

she

<EOS>
"
"
Never

said
my
mother
;

I
am
sure
I
took
great
pains

you

,
alas

I
to
very

You
had
always
a
violent
headstrong
will

<EOS>
"
  
"
"
Some
allowances
for
boys

girls
,
I
hope
,
Madam

you
see
I
am
as
good

a
man

"
No

not

I
do
assure

"
  
<EOS>
"
"
I
am
sorry
for
that

<EOS>
Madam

you
give
me
a
sad
opinion
of
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Brazen
wretch
!
"
<EOS>
said
my
lady
;
"
but
go
on
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
"
Turn
to
one
of
the
girl
's
observations
on
some
text
,
"
said
my
mother
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
;
and
was
pleased
with
it
more
than
I
would
own
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
girl
's
well
enough
,
"
said
I
,
"
<EOS>
for
what
she
is
;
but
let
's
see
what
she
'll
be
a
few
years
hence
.
<EOS>
Then
will
be
the
trial
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
"
She
'll
be
always
good
<EOS>
,
I
doubt
not
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
"
So
much
the
better
for
her
.
<EOS>
But
ca
n't
we
talk
of
any
other
subject
?
<EOS>
You
complain
how
seldom
I
attend
you
;
and
when
you
are
always
talking
of
matrimony
,
or
of
this
low
-
born
,
raw
girl
,
it
must
needs
lessen
the
pleasure
of
approaching
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
now
,
as
I
hinted
to
you
,
ladies
,
and
my
lord
,
I
had
a
still
higher
opinion
of
Pamela
;
and
esteemed
her
more
worthy
of
my
attempts
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
For
,
"
thought
I
,
"
the
girl
has
good
sense
,
and
it
will
be
some
pleasure
to
watch
by
what
gradations
she
may
be
made
to
rise
into
love
,
and
into
a
higher
life
,
than
that
to
which
she
was
born
.
"
<EOS>
And
so
I
began
to
think
she
would
be
worthy
in
time
of
being
my
mistress
,
which
,
till
now
,
as
I
said
before
,
I
had
been
a
little
scrupulous
about
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
took
a
little
tour
soon
after
this
in
company
of
some
friends
,
with
whom
I
had
contracted
an
intimacy
abroad
,
into
Scotland
and
Ireland
,
they
having
a
curiosity
to
see
those
countries
,
and
we
spent
six
or
eight
months
on
this
expedition
;
and
when
I
had
landed
them
in
France
,
I
returned
home
,
and
found
my
good
mother
in
a
very
indifferent
state
of
health
,
but
her
Pamela
arrived
to
a
height
of
beauty
and
perfection
which
exceeded
all
my
expectations
.
<EOS>
I
was
so
taken
with
her
charms
<EOS>
when
I
first
saw
her
,
which
was
in
the
garden
,
with
a
book
in
her
hand
,
just
come
out
of
a
little
summer
-
house
,
that
I
then
thought
of
obliging
her
to
go
back
again
,
in
order
to
begin
a
parley
with
her
:
but
while
I
was
resolving
,
she
tript
away
with
her
curtesies
and
reverences
,
and
was
out
of
my
sight
before
I
could
determine
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
resolved
,
however
,
not
to
be
long
without
her
;
and
Mrs.
Jewkes
having
been
recommended
to
me
a
little
before
,
by
a
brother
-
rake
,
as
a
woman
of
tried
fidelity
,
I
asked
her
if
she
would
be
faithful
,
if
I
had
occasion
to
commit
a
pretty
girl
to
her
care
?
  
<EOS>
"
She
hoped
,
she
said
,
it
would
be
with
the
lady
's
own
consent
,
and
she
should
make
no
scruple
in
obeying
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
I
thought
I
would
way
-
lay
the
girl
,
and
carry
her
first
to
a
little
village
in
Northamptonshire
,
to
an
acquaintance
of
Mrs.
Jewkes
's
.
<EOS>
And
when
I
had
brought
her
to
be
easy
and
pacified
a
little
,
I
designed
that
Jewkes
should
attend
her
to
Lincolnshire
:
for
I
knew
there
was
no
coming
at
her
here
,
under
my
mother
's
wing
,
by
her
own
consent
,
and
that
to
offer
terms
to
her
,
would
be
to
blow
up
my
project
all
at
once
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
I
was
sensible
,
that
Mrs.
Jervis
would
stand
in
the
way
of
my
proceedings
as
well
as
my
mother
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
method
I
had
contrived
was
quite
easy
,
as
I
imagined
,
and
such
as
could
not
have
failed
to
answer
my
purpose
,
as
to
carrying
her
off
;
and
I
doubted
not
of
making
her
well
satisfied
in
her
good
fortune
very
quickly
;
for
,
having
a
notion
of
her
affectionate
duty
to
her
parents
,
I
was
not
displeased
that
I
could
make
the
terms
very
easy
and
happy
to
them
all
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
most
stood
in
my
way
,
was
my
mother
's
fondness
for
her
:
but
supposing
I
had
got
her
favourite
in
my
hands
,
which
appeared
to
me
,
as
I
said
,
a
task
very
easy
to
be
conquered
,
I
had
actually
formed
a
letter
for
her
to
transcribe
,
acknowledging
a
love
-
affair
,
and
laying
her
withdrawing
herself
so
privately
,
to
an
implicit
obedience
to
her
husband
's
commands
,
to
whom
she
was
married
that
morning
,
and
who
,
being
a
young
gentleman
of
genteel
family
,
and
dependent
on
his
friends
,
was
desirous
of
keeping
it
all
a
profound
secret
;
and
begging
,
on
that
account
,
her
lady
not
to
divulge
it
,
so
much
as
to
Mrs.
Jervis
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
to
prepare
for
this
,
and
make
her
escape
the
more
probable
,
when
matters
were
ripe
for
my
plot
,
I
came
in
one
night
,
and
examined
all
the
servants
,
and
Mrs.
Jervis
,
the
latter
in
my
mother
's
hearing
,
about
a
genteel
young
man
,
whom
I
pretended
to
find
with
a
pillion
on
the
horse
he
rode
upon
,
waiting
about
the
back
door
of
the
garden
,
for
somebody
to
come
to
him
;
and
who
rode
off
,
when
I
came
up
to
the
door
,
as
fast
as
he
could
.
<EOS>
Nobody
knew
any
thing
of
the
matter
,
and
they
were
much
surprised
at
what
I
told
them
:
but
I
begged
Pamela
might
be
watched
,
and
that
no
one
would
say
any
thing
to
her
about
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
mother
said
,
she
had
two
reasons
not
to
speak
of
it
to
Pamela
:
one
to
oblige
me
:
the
other
and
chief
,
because
it
would
break
the
poor
innocent
girl
's
heart
,
to
be
suspected
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Poor
dear
child
!
"
said
she
,
"
whither
can
she
go
,
to
be
so
happy
as
with
me
?
<EOS>
Would
it
not
be
inevitable
ruin
to
her
to
leave
me
?
<EOS>
There
is
nobody
comes
after
her
:
she
receives
no
letters
,
but
now
-
and
-
then
one
from
her
father
and
mother
,
and
those
she
shews
me
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
replied
I
,
"
<EOS>
I
hope
she
can
have
no
design
;
 
'
twould
be
strange
if
she
had
formed
any
to
leave
so
good
a
mistress
;
but
you
ca
n't
be
sure
all
the
letters
she
receives
are
from
her
father
;
and
her
shewing
to
you
those
he
writes
,
looks
like
a
cloak
to
others
she
may
receive
from
another
hand
.
<EOS>
But
it
can
be
no
harm
to
have
an
eye
upon
her
.
<EOS>
You
do
n't
know
,
Madam
,
what
tricks
there
are
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
"
Not
I
,
indeed
;
but
only
this
I
know
,
that
the
girl
shall
be
under
no
restraint
,
if
she
is
resolved
to
leave
me
,
well
as
I
love
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Jervis
said
,
she
would
have
an
eye
upon
Pamela
,
in
obedience
to
my
command
,
but
she
was
sure
there
was
no
need
;
nor
would
she
so
much
wound
the
poor
child
's
peace
,
as
to
mention
the
matter
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
This
I
suffered
to
blow
off
,
and
seemed
to
my
mother
to
have
so
good
an
opinion
of
her
Pamela
,
that
I
was
sorry
,
as
I
told
her
,
I
had
such
a
surmise
:
saying
,
that
though
the
fellow
and
the
pillion
were
odd
circumstances
,
yet
I
dared
to
say
,
there
was
nothing
in
it
:
for
I
doubted
not
,
the
girl
's
duty
and
gratitude
would
hinder
her
from
doing
a
foolish
or
rash
thing
.
  
<EOS>
"
This
my
mother
heard
with
pleasure
:
although
my
motive
was
but
to
lay
Pamela
on
the
thicker
to
her
,
when
she
was
to
be
told
she
had
escaped

<EOS>
"
She
was
glad
I
was
not
an
enemy
to
the
poor
child
.

<EOS>
Pamela
has
no
friend
but
me
,
"
continued
she
;
"
and
if
I
do
n't
provide
for
her
,
I
shall
have
done
her
more
harm
than
good
(
as
you
and
your
aunt
B.
have
often
said
,
)
in
the
accomplishments
I
have
given
her
:
and
<EOS>
yet
the
poor
girl
<EOS>
,
I
see
that
,
"
added
she
,
"
would
not
be
backward
to
turn
her
hand
to
any
thing
for
the
sake
of
an
honest
livelihood
,
were
she
put
to
it
;
which
,
if
it
please
God
to
spare
me
,
and
she
continues
good
,
she
never
shall
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
not
,
Pamela
,
at
your
tears
on
this
occasion
.
<EOS>
Your
lady
was
an
excellent
woman
,
and
deserved
this
tribute
to
her
memory
.
<EOS>
All
my
pleasure
now
is
,
that
she
knew
not
half
my
wicked
pranks
,
and
that
I
did
not
vex
her
worthy
heart
in
the
prosecution
of
this
scheme
;
which
would
have
given
me
a
severe
sting
,
<EOS>
inasmuch
as
I
might
have
apprehended
,
with
too
much
reason
,
that
I
had
shortened
her
days
by
the
knowledge
of
the
one
and
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
had
thus
every
thing
ready
for
the
execution
of
my
project
:
but
my
mother
's
ill
state
of
health
gave
me
too
much
concern
,
to
permit
me
to
proceed
.
<EOS>
And
,
now
-
and
-
then
,
as
my
frequent
attendance
in
her
illness
gave
me
an
opportunity
of
observing
more
and
more
of
the
girl
;
her
affectionate
duty
,
and
continual
tears
<EOS>
(
finding
her
often
on
her
knees
,
praying
for
her
mistress
,
)
<EOS>
I
was
moved
to
pity
her
;
and
while
those
scenes
of
my
mother
's
illness
and
decline
were
before
me
,
I
would
resolve
to
conquer
,
if
possible
,
my
guilty
passion
,
as
those
scenes
taught
me
,
while
their
impressions
held
,
justly
to
call
it
;
and
I
was
much
concerned
to
find
it
so
difficult
a
task
;
for
,
till
now
,
I
thought
it
principally
owing
to
my
usual
enterprising
temper
,
and
a
love
of
intrigue
;
and
that
I
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
resolve
against
it
,
and
to
subdue
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
was
greatly
mistaken
:
for
I
had
insensibly
brought
myself
to
admire
her
in
every
thing
she
said
or
did
;
and
there
was
so
much
gracefulness
,
humility
,
and
innocence
in
her
whole
behaviour
,
and
I
saw
so
many
melting
scenes
between
her
lady
and
her
,
that
I
found
I
could
not
master
my
esteem
for
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
mother
's
illness
increasing
beyond
hopes
of
recovery
,
and
having
settled
all
her
greater
affairs
,
she
talked
to
me
of
her
servants
;
I
asked
what
she
would
have
done
for
Pamela
and
Mrs.
Jervis
.
  
<EOS>
"
Make
Mrs.
Jervis
,
my
dear
son
,
as
happy
as
you
can
:
she
is
a
gentlewoman
born
,
you
know
;
let
her
always
be
treated
as
such
;
but
for
your
own
sake
,
do
n't
make
her
independent
;
for
then
you
'll
want
a
faithful
manager
.
<EOS>
Yet
if
you
marry
,
and
your
lady
should
not
value
her
as
she
deserves
,
allow
her
a
competency
for
the
rest
of
her
life
,
and
let
her
live
as
she
pleases
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
"
As
for
Pamela
,
I
hope
you
will
be
her
protector
!
 
<EOS>
She
is
a
good
girl
<EOS>
:
I
love
her
next
to
you
and
your
dear
sister
.
<EOS>
She
is
just
arriving
at
a
trying
time
of
life
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
what
to
say
for
her
.
<EOS>
What
I
had
designed
was
,
that
if
any
man
of
a
genteel
calling
should
offer
,
I
would
give
her
a
little
pretty
portion
,
had
God
spared
my
life
till
then
.
<EOS>
But
were
she
made
independent
,
some
idle
fellow
might
snap
her
up
;
for
she
is
very
pretty
:
or
if
she
should
carry
what
you
give
her
to
her
poor
parents
,
as
her
duty
would
lead
her
to
do
,
they
are
so
unhappily
involved
,
that
a
little
matter
would
be
nothing
to
them
,
and
the
poor
girl
might
be
to
seek
again
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
Lady
Davers
will
take
her
.
<EOS>
But
I
wish
she
was
not
so
pretty
!
<EOS>
She
may
be
the
bird
for
which
some
wicked
fowler
will
spread
his
snares
;
or
,
it
may
be
,
every
lady
will
not
choose
to
have
such
a
waiting
-
maid
.
<EOS>
You
are
a
young
gentleman
,
and
I
am
sorry
to
say
,
not
better
than
I
wish
you
to
be
 
<EOS>
Though
I
hope
my
Pamela
would
not
be
in
danger
from
her
master
,
who
owes
all
his
servants
protection
,
as
much
as
the
king
does
to
his
subjects
.
<EOS>
Yet
I
do
n't
know
how
to
wish
her
to
stay
with
you
,
for
your
own
reputation
's
sake
,
my
dear
son
;
 
for
the
world
will
censure
as
it
lists
.
 
<EOS>
Would
to
God
!
"
<EOS>
said
she
,
"
the
dear
girl
had
the
small
-
pox
in
a
mortifying
manner
:
she
'd
be
lovely
though
in
the
genteelness
of
her
person
and
the
excellencies
of
her
mind
;
and
more
out
of
danger
of
suffering
from
the
transcient
beauties
of
countenance
.
<EOS>
Yet
I
think
,
"
added
she
,
"
she
might
be
safe
and
happy
under
Mrs.
Jervis
's
care
;
and
if
you
marry
,
and
your
lady
parts
with
Mrs.
Jervis
,
let
'em
go
together
,
and
live
as
they
like
.
<EOS>
I
think
that
will
be
the
best
for
both
.
<EOS>
And
you
have
a
generous
spirit
enough
:
I
will
not
direct
you
in
the
quantum
.
<EOS>
But
,
my
dear
son
,
remember
that
I
am
the
less
concerned
,
that
I
have
not
done
for
the
poor
girl
myself
,
because
I
depend
upon
you
:
<EOS>
the
manner
how
fitly
to
provide
for
her
,
has
made
me
defer
it
till
now
,
that
I
have
so
much
more
important
concerns
on
my
hands
;
life
and
strength
ebbing
so
fast
,
that
I
am
hardly
fit
for
any
thing
,
or
to
wish
for
any
thing
,
but
to
receive
the
last
releasing
stroke
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Here
he
stopped
,
being
under
some
concern
himself
,
and
we
in
much
more
.
<EOS>
At
last
he
resumed
the
subject
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
too
naturally
think
,
my
lord
 
and
you
,
my
good
ladies
 
that
the
mind
must
be
truly
diabolical
,
that
could
break
through
the
regard
due
to
the
solemn
injunctions
of
a
dying
parent
.
<EOS>
They
did
hold
me
a
good
while
indeed
;
and
as
fast
as
I
found
any
emotions
of
a
contrary
nature
rise
in
my
breast
,
I
endeavoured
for
some
time
to
suppress
them
,
and
to
think
and
act
as
I
ought
;
but
the
dear
bewitching
girl
every
day
rose
in
her
charms
upon
me
:
and
finding
she
still
continued
the
use
of
her
pen
and
ink
<EOS>
,
I
could
not
help
entertaining
a
jealousy
,
that
she
was
writing
to
somebody
who
stood
well
in
her
opinion
;
and
my
love
for
her
,
and
my
own
spirit
of
intrigue
,
made
it
a
sweetheart
of
course
.
<EOS>
And
I
could
not
help
watching
her
emotions
;
and
seeing
her
once
putting
a
letter
she
had
just
folded
up
,
into
her
bosom
,
at
my
entrance
into
my
mother
's
dressing
-
room
,
I
made
no
doubt
of
detecting
her
,
and
her
correspondent
;
and
so
I
took
the
letter
from
her
stays
<EOS>
,
she
trembling
and
curtseying
with
a
sweet
confusion
:
and
highly
pleased
I
was
to
find
it
contained
only
innocence
and
duty
to
the
deceased
mistress
,
and
the
loving
parents
,
expressing
her
joy
that
,
in
the
midst
of
her
grief
for
losing
the
one
,
she
was
not
obliged
to
return
to
be
a
burden
to
the
other
;
and
I
gave
it
her
again
,
with
words
of
encouragement
,
and
went
down
much
better
satisfied
than
I
had
been
with
her
correspondence
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
when
I
reflected
upon
the
innocent
simplicity
of
her
style
,
I
was
still
more
in
love
with
her
,
and
formed
a
stratagem
,
and
succeeded
in
it
,
to
come
at
her
other
letters
,
which
I
sent
forward
,
after
I
had
read
them
,
all
but
three
or
four
,
which
I
kept
back
,
when
my
plot
began
to
ripen
for
execution
;
although
the
little
slut
was
most
abominably
free
with
my
character
to
her
parents
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
censure
me
,
no
doubt
,
that
my
mother
's
injunctions
made
not
a
more
lasting
impression
.
<EOS>
But
really
I
struggled
hard
with
myself
to
give
them
their
due
force
:
and
<EOS>
the
dear
girl
,
as
I
said
,
every
day
grew
lovelier
,
and
more
accomplished
.
<EOS>
Her
letters
were
but
<EOS>
so
many
links
to
the
chains
in
which
she
had
bound
me
;
and
though
once
I
had
resolved
to
part
with
her
to
Lady
Davers
,
and
you
,
Madam
,
had
an
intention
to
take
her
,
I
could
not
for
my
life
give
her
up
;
and
thinking
more
honourably
then
of
the
state
of
a
mistress
than
I
have
done
since
<EOS>
,
I
could
not
persuade
myself
(
since
I
intended
to
do
as
handsomely
by
her
as
ever
man
did
to
a
lady
in
that
situation
)
but
that
I
should
do
better
for
her
than
my
mother
had
wished
me
to
do
,
and
so
more
than
answer
all
her
injunctions
,
as
to
the
providing
for
her
:
and
I
could
not
imagine
I
should
meet
with
a
resistance
I
had
seldom
encountered
from
persons
much
her
superiors
as
to
descent
;
and
was
amazed
at
it
;
for
it
confounded
me
in
all
the
notions
I
had
of
her
sex
,
which
,
like
a
true
libertine
,
I
supposed
wanted
nothing
but
importunity
and
opportunity
,
a
bold
attempter
,
and
a
mind
not
ungenerous
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
I
admired
her
for
her
virtue
;
at
other
times
,
impetuous
in
my
temper
,
and
unused
to
control
,
I
could
have
beat
her
.
<EOS>
She
<EOS>
well
,
I
remember
,
describes
the
tumults
of
my
soul
,
repeating
what
once
passed
between
us
,
in
words
like
,
these
:
 
<EOS>
"
Take
the
little
witch
from
me
,
Mrs.
Jervis
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
neither
bear
,
nor
forbear
her
 
<EOS>
But
stay
-
<EOS>
you
sha
n't
go
 
<EOS>
Yet
be
gone
!
 
<EOS>
No
,
come
back
again
.
"
 
<EOS>
She
thought
I
was
mad
,
she
says
in
her
papers
.
<EOS>
Indeed
I
was
little
less
.
<EOS>
She
says
,
I
took
her
arm
,
and
griped
it
black
and
blue
,
to
bring
her
back
again
;
and
then
sat
down
and
looked
at
her
as
silly
as
such
a
poor
girl
as
she
!
 
<EOS>
Well
did
she
describe
the
passion
I
struggled
with
;
and
no
one
can
conceive
how
much
my
pride
made
me
despise
myself
at
times
for
the
little
actions
my
love
for
her
put
me
upon
,
and
yet
to
find
that
love
increasing
every
day
,
as
her
charms
and
her
resistance
increased
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
caught
myself
in
a
raging
fit
,
sometimes
vowing
I
would
have
her
,
and
,
at
others
,
jealous
that
,
to
secure
herself
from
my
attempts
,
she
would
throw
herself
into
the
arms
of
some
menial
or
inferior
,
whom
otherwise
she
would
not
have
thought
of
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sometimes
I
soothed
,
sometimes
threatened
her
;
but
never
was
such
courage
,
when
her
virtue
seemed
in
danger
,
mixed
with
so
much
humility
,
when
her
fears
gave
way
to
her
hopes
of
a
juster
treatment
.
 
<EOS>
Then
I
would
think
it
impossible
<EOS>
(
so
slight
an
opinion
had
I
of
woman
's
virtue
)
<EOS>
that
such
a
girl
as
this
,
cottage
-
born
,
who
owed
every
thing
to
my
family
,
and
had
an
absolute
dependence
upon
my
pleasure
:
myself
not
despicable
in
person
or
mind
,
as
I
supposed
;
she
unprejudiced
in
any
man
's
favour
,
at
an
age
susceptible
of
impressions
,
and
a
frame
and
constitution
not
ice
or
snow
:
"
<EOS>
Surely
,
"
thought
I
,
"
all
this
frost
must
be
owing
to
the
want
of
fire
in
my
attempts
to
thaw
it
:
<EOS>
I
used
to
dare
more
,
and
succeed
better
.
<EOS>
Shall
such
a
girl
as
this
awe
me
by
her
rigid
virtue
?
<EOS>
No
,
she
shall
not
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
I
would
resolve
to
be
more
in
earnest
.
<EOS>
Yet
my
love
was
a
traitor
,
that
was
more
faithful
to
her
than
to
me
;
it
had
more
honour
in
it
at
bottom
than
I
had
designed
.
<EOS>
Awed
by
her
unaffected
innocence
,
and
a
virtue
I
had
never
before
encountered
,
so
uniform
and
immovable
,
the
moment
I
saw
her
<EOS>
I
was
half
disarmed
;
and
I
courted
her
consent
to
that
,
which
,
though
I
was
not
likely
to
obtain
,
yet
it
went
against
me
to
think
of
extorting
by
violence
.
<EOS>
Yet
marriage
was
never
in
my
thoughts
:
I
scorned
so
much
as
to
promise
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
To
what
numberless
mean
things
did
not
this
unmanly
passion
subject
me
!
 
<EOS>
I
used
to
watch
for
her
letters
,
though
mere
prittle
-
prattle
and
chit
-
chat
,
received
them
with
delight
,
though
myself
was
accused
in
them
,
and
stigmatized
as
I
deserved
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
listen
meanly
at
her
chamber
-
door
,
try
to
overhear
her
little
conversation
;
in
vain
attempted
to
suborn
Mrs.
Jervis
to
my
purposes
,
inconsistently
talking
of
honour
,
when
no
one
step
I
took
,
or
action
I
attempted
,
shewed
any
thing
like
it
:
lost
my
dignity
among
my
servants
;
made
a
party
in
her
favour
against
me
,
of
every
body
,
but
whom
my
money
corrupted
,
and
that
hardly
sufficient
to
keep
my
partisans
steady
to
my
interest
;
so
greatly
did
the
virtue
of
the
servants
triumph
over
the
vice
of
the
master
,
when
confirmed
by
such
an
example
!
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
very
tedious
,
ladies
and
my
Lord
Davers
,
in
my
narration
:
but
I
am
come
within
view
of
the
point
for
which
I
now
am
upon
my
trial
at
your
dread
tribunal
(
bowing
to
us
all
)
.
  
<EOS>
"
After
several
endeavours
of
a
smooth
and
rough
nature
,
in
which
my
devil
constantly
failed
me
,
and
her
good
angel
prevailed
,
<EOS>
I
had
talked
to
Mrs.
Jervis
to
seduce
the
girl
(
to
whom
,
in
hopes
of
frightening
her
,
I
had
given
warning
,
but
which
she
rejected
to
take
,
to
my
great
disappointment
)
to
desire
to
stay
;
and
suspecting
Mrs.
Jervis
played
me
booty
,
and
rather
confirmed
her
in
her
coyness
,
and
her
desire
of
leaving
me
,
I
was
mean
enough
to
conceal
myself
in
the
closet
in
Mrs.
Jervis
's
room
,
in
order
to
hear
their
private
conversation
;
but
really
not
designing
to
make
any
other
use
of
my
concealment
,
than
to
tease
her
a
little
,
if
she
should
say
any
thing
I
did
not
like
;
which
would
give
me
a
pretence
to
treat
her
with
greater
freedoms
than
I
had
ever
yet
done
,
and
would
be
an
introduction
to
take
off
from
her
unprecedented
apprehensiveness
another
time
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
the
dear
prattler
,
not
knowing
I
was
there
,
as
she
undressed
herself
,
begun
such
a
bewitching
chit
-
chat
with
Mrs.
Jervis
,
who
,
I
found
,
but
ill
kept
my
secret
,
that
I
never
was
at
such
a
loss
what
to
resolve
upon
.
<EOS>
One
while
I
wished
myself
,
unknown
to
them
,
out
of
the
closet
,
into
which
my
inconsiderate
passion
had
meanly
led
me
;
another
time
I
was
incensed
at
the
freedom
with
which
I
heard
myself
treated
:
but
then
,
rigidly
considering
that
I
had
no
business
to
hearken
to
their
private
conversation
,
and
it
was
such
as
became
them
,
while
I
ought
to
have
been
ashamed
to
give
occasion
for
it
<EOS>
,
I
excused
them
both
,
and
admired
still
more
and
more
the
dear
prattler
.
  
<EOS>
"
In
this
suspense
,
the
undesigned
rustling
of
my
night
-
gown
,
from
changing
my
posture
,
alarming
the
watchful
Pamela
,
she
in
a
fright
came
towards
the
closet
to
see
who
was
there
.
<EOS>
What
could
I
then
do
,
but
bolt
out
upon
the
apprehensive
charmer
;
and
having
so
done
,
and
she
running
to
the
bed
,
screaming
to
Mrs.
Jervis
,
would
not
any
man
have
followed
her
thither
,
detected
as
I
was
?
<EOS>
But
yet
,
I
said
,
if
she
forbore
her
screaming
,
I
would
do
her
no
harm
;
but
if
not
,
she
should
take
the
consequence
.
<EOS>
I
found
,
by
their
exclamations
,
that
this
would
pass
with
both
for
an
attempt
of
the
worst
kind
;
but
really
I
had
no
such
intentions
as
they
feared
.
<EOS>
When
I
found
myself
detected
;
when
the
dear
frightened
girl
ran
to
the
bed
;
when
Mrs.
Jervis
threw
herself
about
her
;
when
they
would
not
give
over
their
hideous
squallings
;
when
I
was
charged
by
Mrs.
Jervis
with
the
worst
designs
;
it
was
enough
to
make
me
go
farther
than
I
designed
;
and
could
I
have
prevailed
upon
Mrs.
Jervis
to
go
up
,
and
quiet
the
maids
,
who
seemed
to
be
rising
,
upon
the
other
screaming
<EOS>
,
I
believe
,
had
Pamela
kept
out
of
her
fit
,
I
should
have
been
a
little
freer
with
her
,
than
ever
I
had
been
;
but
,
as
it
was
,
I
had
no
thought
<EOS>
but
of
making
as
honourable
a
retreat
as
I
could
,
and
to
save
myself
from
being
exposed
to
my
whole
family
:
<EOS>
and
I
was
not
guilty
of
any
freedoms
,
that
her
modesty
,
unaffrighted
,
could
reproach
herself
with
having
suffered
;
and
the
dear
creature
's
fainting
fits
gave
me
almost
as
great
apprehensions
as
I
could
give
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Thus
,
ladies
 
and
,
my
lord
 
have
I
tediously
,
and
little
enough
to
my
own
reputation
,
given
you
my
character
,
and
told
you
more
against
myself
than
any
one
person
could
accuse
me
of
.
<EOS>
Whatever
redounds
to
the
credit
of
my
Pamela
,
redounds
in
part
to
my
own
;
and
so
I
have
the
less
regret
to
accuse
myself
,
since
it
exalts
her
.
<EOS>
But
as
to
a
formed
intention
to
hide
myself
in
the
closet
,
in
order
to
attempt
the
girl
by
violence
,
and
in
the
presence
of
a
good
woman
,
as
Mrs.
Jervis
is
,
which
you
impute
to
me
,
bad
as
I
was
,
I
was
not
so
vile
,
so
abandoned
as
that
.
  
<EOS>
"
Love
,
as
I
said
before
,
subjects
its
inconsiderate
votaries
to
innumerable
meannesses
,
and
unlawful
passion
to
many
more
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
live
without
this
dear
girl
.
<EOS>
I
hated
the
thoughts
of
matrimony
with
any
body
:
and
to
be
brought
to
the
state
by
my
mother
's
waiting
-
maid
.
 
<EOS>
"
Forbid
it
,
pride
!
"
<EOS>
thought
I
;
"
forbid
it
,
example
!
<EOS>
forbid
it
,
all
my
past
sneers
,
and
constant
ridicule
,
both
on
the
estate
,
and
on
those
who
descended
to
inequalities
in
it
!
<EOS>
and
,
lastly
,
forbid
it
my
family
spirit
,
so
visible
in
Lady
Davers
,
as
well
as
in
myself
,
to
whose
insults
,
and
those
of
all
the
world
,
I
shall
be
obnoxious
,
if
I
take
such
a
step
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
All
this
tends
to
demonstrate
the
strength
of
my
passion
:
I
could
not
conquer
my
love
;
so
I
conquered
a
pride
,
which
every
one
thought
unconquerable
;
and
since
I
could
not
make
an
innocent
heart
vicious
,
I
had
the
happiness
to
follow
so
good
an
example
;
and
by
this
means
,
a
vicious
heart
is
become
virtuous
.
<EOS>
I
have
the
pleasure
of
rejoicing
in
the
change
,
and
hope
I
shall
do
so
still
more
and
more
;
for
I
really
view
with
contempt
my
past
follies
;
and
it
is
now
a
greater
wonder
to
me
how
I
could
act
as
I
did
,
than
that
I
should
detest
those
actions
,
which
made
me
a
curse
,
instead
of
a
benefit
to
society
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
yet
so
pious
as
my
Pamela
;
but
that
is
to
come
;
and
it
is
one
good
sign
,
that
I
can
truly
say
,
I
delight
in
every
instance
of
her
piety
and
virtue
:
and
now
I
will
conclude
my
tedious
narration
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Thus
he
ended
his
affecting
relation
:
which
in
the
course
of
it
gave
me
a
thousand
different
emotions
;
and
made
me
often
pray
for
him
,
that
God
will
entirely
convert
a
heart
so
generous
and
worthy
,
as
his
is
on
most
occasions
.
<EOS>
And
if
I
can
but
find
him
not
deviate
,
when
we
go
to
London
,
I
shall
greatly
hope
that
nothing
will
affect
his
morals
again
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
just
read
over
again
the
foregoing
account
of
himself
.
<EOS>
As
near
as
I
remember
(
and
my
memory
is
the
best
faculty
I
have
)
,
it
is
pretty
exact
;
only
he
was
fuller
of
beautiful
similitudes
,
and
spoke
in
a
more
flowery
style
,
as
I
may
say
.
<EOS>
Yet
do
n't
you
think
,
Miss
<EOS>
(
if
I
have
not
done
injustice
to
his
spirit
)
,
that
the
beginning
of
it
,
especially
,
is
in
the
saucy
air
of
a
man
too
much
alive
to
such
notions
?
<EOS>
For
so
the
ladies
observed
in
his
narration
.
 
<EOS>
Is
it
very
like
the
style
of
a
true
penitent
?
 
<EOS>
But
indeed
he
went
on
better
,
and
concluded
best
of
all
.
  
<EOS>
But
do
n't
you
observe
what
a
dear
good
lady
I
had
?
<EOS>
A
thousand
blessings
on
her
beloved
memory
!
<EOS>
Were
I
to
live
to
see
my
children
's
children
,
they
should
be
all
taught
to
lisp
her
praises
before
they
could
speak
.
<EOS>
My
gratitude
should
always
be
renewed
in
their
mouths
;
and
God
,
and
my
dear
father
and
mother
,
my
lady
,
and
my
master
that
was
,
my
best
friend
that
is
,
but
principally
,
as
most
due
,
the
FIRST
,
who
inspired
all
the
rest
,
should
have
their
morning
,
their
noontide
,
and
their
evening
praises
,
as
long
as
I
lived
!
  
<EOS>
I
will
only
observe
farther
,
as
to
this
my
third
conversation
-
piece
,
that
my
Lord
Davers
offered
to
extenuate
some
parts
of
his
dear
brother
-
in
-
law
's
conduct
,
which
he
did
not
himself
vindicate
;
and
Mr.
B.
was
pleased
to
say
,
that
my
lord
was
always
very
candid
to
him
,
and
kind
in
his
allowances
for
the
sallies
of
ungovernable
youth
.
<EOS>
Upon
which
my
lady
said
,
a
little
tartly
,
"
Yes
,
and
for
a
very
good
reason
,
I
doubt
not
;
for
who
cares
to
condemn
himself
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
"
said
my
lord
pleasantly
,
"
do
n't
put
us
upon
a
foot
,
neither
:
for
what
sallies
I
made
before
I
knew
your
ladyship
,
were
<EOS>
but
like
those
of
a
fox
,
which
now
and
then
runs
away
with
a
straggling
pullet
,
when
nobody
sees
him
,
whereas
those
of
my
brother
were
like
the
invasions
of
a
lion
,
breaking
into
every
man
's
fold
,
and
driving
the
shepherds
,
as
well
as
the
sheep
,
before
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
"
said
my
lady
,
"
but
I
can
look
round
me
,
and
have
reason
,
perhaps
,
to
think
the
invading
lion
has
come
off
,
little
as
he
deserved
it
,
better
than
the
creeping
fox
,
who
,
with
all
his
cunning
,
sometimes
suffers
for
his
pilfering
theft
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
O
,
my
dear
,
these
gentlemen
are
strange
creatures
!
 
<EOS>
What
can
they
think
of
themselves
?
<EOS>
for
they
say
,
there
is
not
one
virtuous
man
in
five
;
but
I
hope
,
for
our
sex
's
sake
,
as
well
as
for
the
world
's
sake
,
all
is
not
true
that
evil
fame
reports
;
for
you
know
<EOS>
every
man
-
trespasser
must
find
or
make
a
woman
-
trespasser
!
 
<EOS>
And
if
so
,
what
a
world
is
this
!
 
<EOS>
And
how
must
the
innocent
suffer
from
the
guilty
!
<EOS>
Yet
,
how
much
better
is
it
to
suffer
one
's
self
,
than
to
be
the
cause
of
another
's
sufferings
?
<EOS>
I
long
to
hear
of
you
,
and
must
shorten
my
future
accounts
,
or
I
shall
do
nothing
but
write
,
and
tire
you
into
the
bargain
,
though
I
can
not
my
dear
father
and
mother
.
<EOS>
I
am
,
my
dear
Miss
,
always
yours
,
P.B.
    
From

Mrs.

DEAR
MRS

<EOS>
B.
,
  
<EOS>
Every
post
you
more
and
more
oblige
us
to
admire
and
love
you
:
and
let
me
say
,
I
will
gladly
receive
your
letters
upon
your
own
terms
:
only
when
your
worthy
parents
have
perused
them
,
see
that
I
have
every
line
of
them
again
.
  
<EOS>
Your
account
of
the
arrival
of
your
noble
guests
,
and
their
behaviour
to
you
,
and
yours
to
them
;
your
conversation
,
and
wise
determination
,
on
the
offered
title
of
Baronet
<EOS>
;
the
just
applauses
conferred
upon
you
by
all
,
<EOS>
particularly
the
good
countess
;
your
breakfast
conversation
,
and
the
narrative
of
your
saucy
abominable
master
,
though
amiable
husband
;
all
delight
us
beyond
expression
.
  
<EOS>
Do
go
on
,
dear
excellent
lady
,
with
your
charming
journals
,
and
let
us
know
all
that
passes
.
  
<EOS>
As
to
the
state
of
matters
with
us
,
I
have
desired
my
papa
to
allow
me
to
decline
Mr.
Murray
's
addresses
.
<EOS>
The
good
man
loved
me
most
violently
,
nay
,
he
could
not
live
without
me
:
life
was
no
life
,
unless
I
favoured
him
:
but
<EOS>
yet
,
after
a
few
more
of
these
flights
,
he
is
trying
to
sit
down
satisfied
without
my
papa
's
foolish
perverse
girl
,
as
Sir
Simon
calls
me
,
and
to
transpose
his
affections
to
a
worthier
object
,
my
sister
Nancy
;
and
it
would
make
you
smile
to
see
how
,
a
little
while
before
he
directly
applied
to
her
<EOS>
,
she
screwed
up
her
mouth
to
my
mamma
,
and
,
truly
,
she
'd
have
none
of
Polly
's
leavings
;
no
,
not
she
!
 
<EOS>
But
no
sooner
did
he
declare
himself
in
form
,
than
the
gaudy
wretch
,
as
he
was
before
with
her
,
became
a
well
-
dressed
gentleman
;
 
<EOS>
the
chattering
magpie
<EOS>
(
for
he
talks
and
laughs
much
)
,
quite
conversable
,
and
has
something
agreeable
to
say
upon
every
subject
.
<EOS>
Once
he
would
make
a
good
master
of
the
buck
-
hounds
;
but
now
,
really
,
the
more
one
is
in
his
company
,
the
more
polite
one
finds
him
.
  
<EOS>
Then
,
on
his
part
,
 
he
happened
to
see
Miss
Polly
first
;
and
truly
,
he
could
have
thought
himself
very
happy
in
so
agreeable
a
young
lady
;
yet
there
was
always
something
of
majesty
(
what
a
stately
name
for
ill
nature
!
)
<EOS>
in
Miss
Nancy
,
something
so
awful
;
that
while
Miss
Polly
engaged
the
affections
at
first
sight
,
Miss
Nancy
struck
a
man
with
reverence
;
insomuch
,
that
the
one
might
he
loved
as
a
woman
,
but
the
other
revered
as
something
more
:
a
goddess
,
no
doubt
!
  
<EOS>
I
do
but
think
,
that
when
he
comes
to
be
lifted
up
to
her
celestial
sphere
,
as
her
fellow
constellation
,
what
a
figure
Nancy
and
her
ursus
major
will
make
together
;
and
how
will
they
glitter
and
shine
to
the
wonder
of
all
beholders
!
  
<EOS>
Then
she
must
make
a
brighter
appearance
by
far
,
and
a
more
pleasing
one
too
:
for
why
?
<EOS>
She
has
three
thousand
satellites
,
or
little
stars
,
in
her
train
more
than
poor
<EOS>
Polly
can
pretend
to
.
<EOS>
Wo
n't
there
be
a
fine
twinkling
and
sparkling
,
think
you
,
when
the
greater
and
lesser
bear
-
stars
are
joined
together
?
  
<EOS>
But
excuse
me
,
dear
Mrs.
B.
;
this
saucy
girl
has
vexed
me
just
now
,
by
her
ill
-
natured
tricks
;
and
I
am
even
with
her
,
having
thus
vented
my
spite
,
though
she
knows
nothing
of
the
matter
.
  
<EOS>
So
,
fancy
you
see
Polly
Darnford
abandoned
by
her
own
fault
;
her
papa
angry
at
her
;
her
mamma
pitying
her
,
and
calling
her
silly
girl
;
Mr.
Murray
,
who
is
a
rough
lover
,
growling
over
his
mistress
,
as
a
dog
over
a
bone
he
fears
to
lose
;
Miss
Nancy
,
putting
on
her
prudish
pleasantry
,
snarling
out
a
kind
word
,
and
breaking
through
her
sullen
gloom
,
for
a
smile
now
and
then
in
return
;
and
I
laughing
at
both
in
my
sleeve
,
and
thinking
I
shall
soon
get
leave
to
attend
you
in
town
,
which
will
be
better
than
twenty
humble
servants
of
Mr.
Murray
's
cast
:
<EOS>
or
,
if
I
ca
n't
,
that
I
shall
have
the
pleasure
of
your
correspondence
here
,
and
enjoy
,
unrivalled
,
the
favour
of
my
dear
parents
,
which
this
ill
-
tempered
girl
is
always
envying
me
.
  
<EOS>
Forgive
all
this
nonsense
.
<EOS>
I
was
willing
to
write
something
,
though
worse
than
nothing
,
to
shew
how
desirous
I
am
to
oblige
you
,
had
I
a

<EOS>
But
nobody

love

or
admire
you
more

of
this
you
may
be
assured
(
however
unequal
in
all
other

,
than
your
POLLY
DARNFORD

<EOS>
I
send
you
up
some
of
your
papers
for
the
good
couple
in
Kent

<EOS>
Pray

pay
my

THURSDAY
,
FRIDAY
EVENING
.
  
<EOS>
My
dear
Miss
Darnford
,
  
I
am
returned
from
a
very
busy
day
,
having
had
no
less
than
fourteen
of
our
neighbours
,
gentlemen
and
ladies
,
to
dinner
:
<EOS>
the
occasion
,
principally
,
to
welcome
our
noble
guests
into
these
parts
<EOS>
;
Mr.
B.
having
,
as
I
mentioned
before
,
turned
the
intended
visit
into
an
entertainment
,
after
his
usual
generous
manner
.
 
<EOS>
He
and
Lord
Davers
are
gone
part
of
the
way
with
them
home
;
and
Lord
Jackey
,
mounted
with
his
favourite
Colbrand
,
as
an
escort
to
the
countess
and
Lady
Davers
,
who
are
taking
an
airing
in
the
chariot
.
<EOS>
They
offered
to
take
the
coach
,
if
I
would
have
gone
;
but
being
fatigued
,
I
desired
to
be
excused
.
<EOS>
So
I
retired
to
my
closet
;
and
Miss
Damford
,
who
is
seldom
out
of
my
thoughts
,
coming
into
my
mind
,
I
had
a
new
recruit
of
spirits
,
which
enabled
me
to
resume
my
pen
,
and
thus
I
proceed
with
my
journal
.
  
<EOS>
Our
company
was
,
the
Earl
and
Countess
of
D.
,
who
are
so
fashionable
a
married
couple
,
that
the
earl
made
it
his
boast
,
and
his
countess
bore
it
like
one
accustomed
to
such
treatment
,
that
he
had
not
been
in
his
lady
's
company
an
hour
abroad
before
for
seven
years
.
<EOS>
You
know
his
lordship
's
character
:
every
body
does
;
and
there
is
not
a
worse
,
as
report
says
,
in
the
peerage
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Thomas
Atkyns
,
a
single
gentleman
,
not
a
little
finical
and
ceremonious
,
and
a
mighty
beau
,
though
of
the
tawdry
sort
,
and
affecting
foreign
airs
;
as
if
he
was
afraid
it
would
not
be
judged
by
any
other
mark
that
he
had
travelled
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Arthur
and
his
lady
,
a
moderately
happy
couple
,
who
seem
always
,
when
together
,
to
behave
as
if
upon
a
compromise
;
that
is
,
that
each
should
take
it
in
turn
to
say
free
things
of
the
other
;
though
some
of
their
freedoms
are
of
so
cutting
a
nature
,
that
it
looks
as
if
they
intended
to
divert
the
company
at
their
own
expense
.
<EOS>
The
lady
,
being
of
a
noble
family
,
strives
to
let
every
one
know
that
she
values
herself
not
a
little
upon
that
advantage
;
but
otherwise
has
many
good
qualities
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Brooks
and
his
lady
.
<EOS>
He
is
a
free
joker
on
serious
subjects
,
but
a
good
-
natured
man
,
and
says
sprightly
things
with
no
ill
grace
:
the
lady
a
little
reserved
,
and
haughty
,
though
to
-
day
was
freer
than
usual
;
as
was
observed
at
table
by
  
<EOS>
Lady
Towers
,
who
is
a
maiden
lady
of
family
,
noted
for
her
wit
and
repartee
,
and
who
says
many
good
things
,
with
so
little
doubt
and
really
so
good
<EOS>
a
grace
,
that
one
can
not
help
being
pleased
with
her
.
<EOS>
This
lady
is
generally
gallanted
by
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Martin
of
the
Grove
,
so
called
,
to
distinguish
him
from
a
rich
citizen
of
that
name
,
settled
in
these
parts
,
but
being
covetous
and
proud
,
is
seldom
admitted
among
the
gentry
in
their
visits
or
parties
of
pleasure
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Dormer
,
one
of
a
very
courteous
demeanour
,
a
widower
,
was
another
,
who
always
speaks
well
of
his
deceased
lady
,
and
of
all
the
sex
for
her
sake
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Chapman
and
his
lady
,
a
well
-
behaved
couple
,
not
ashamed
to
be
very
tender
and
observing
to
each
other
,
but
without
that
censurable
fondness
which
sits
so
ill
upon
some
married
folks
in
company
.
  
<EOS>
Then
there
was
the
dean
,
our
good
minister
,
whom
I
name
last
,
because
I
would
close
with
one
of
the
worthiest
;
and
his
daughter
,
who
came
to
supply
her
mamma
's
place
,
who
was
indisposed
;
a
well
-
behaved
prudent
young
lady
.
<EOS>
And
here
were
our
fourteen
guests
.
  
<EOS>
The
Countess
of
C.
,
Lord
and
Lady
Davers
,
Mr.
H.
,
my
dear
Mr.
B.
and
your
humble
servant
,
made
up
the
rest
of
the
company
.
<EOS>
Thus
we
had
a
capacious
and
brilliant
circle
;
and
all
the
avenues
to
the
house
were
crowded
with
their
equipages
.
  
<EOS>
The
subjects
of
discourse
at
dinner
were
various
,
as
you
may
well
suppose
;
and
the
circle
was
too
large
to
fall
upon
any
regular
or
very
remarkable
topics
.
<EOS>
A
good
deal
of
sprightly
wit
,
however
,
flew
about
,
between
the
Earl
of
D.
,
Lady
Towers
,
and
Mr.
Martin
,
in
which
that
lord
suffered
as
he
deserved
;
for
he
was
no
match
for
the
lady
,
especially
as
the
presence
of
the
dean
was
a
very
visible
restraint
upon
him
,
and
Mr.
Brooks
too
:
<EOS>
so
much
awe
will
the
character
of
a
good
clergyman
always
have
upon
even
forward
spirits
,
where
he
is
known
to
have
had
an
inviolable
regard
to
it
himself
.
 
<EOS>
Besides
,
the
good
gentleman
has
,
naturally
,
a
genteel
and
inoffensive
vein
of
raillery
,
and
so
was
too
hard
for
them
at
their
own
weapons
.
<EOS>
But
after
dinner
,
and
the
servants
being
withdrawn
,
Mr.
Martin
singled
me
out
,
as
he
loves
to
do
,
for
a
subject
of
encomium
,
and
made
some
high
compliments
to
my
dear
Mr.
B.
upon
his
choice
;
and
wished
(
as
he
often
does
)
,
he
could
find
just
such
another
for
himself
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Towers
told
him
it
was
a
thing
as
unaccountable
as
it
was
unreasonable
,
that
every
rake
who
loved
to
destroy
virtue
,
should
expect
to
be
rewarded
with
it
:
and
if
his
brother
B.
had
come
off
so
well
,
she
thought
no
one
else
ought
to
expect
it
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Davers
said
,
it
was
a
very
just
observation
:
and
she
thought
it
a
pity
<EOS>
there
was
not
a
law
,
that
every
man
who
made
a
harlot
of
an
honest
woman
,
should
be
obliged
to
marry
one
of
another
's
making
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
said
,
that
would
be
too
severe
;
it
would
be
punishment
enough
,
if
he
was
to
marry
his
own
;
and
especially
if
he
had
not
seduced
her
under
promise
of
marriage
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
you
'd
have
a
man
be
obliged
to
stand
to
his
promise
,
I
suppose
,
Mr.
B.
?
"
replied
Lady
Davers
.
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
madam
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
,
"
said
she
,
"
the
proof
would
be
difficult
perhaps
:
and
the
most
unguilty
heart
of
our
sex
might
be
least
able
to
make
it
out
.
 
<EOS>
But
what
say
you
,
my
Lord
D.
;
will
you
,
and
my
Lord
Davers
,
join
to
bring
a
bill
into
the
House
of
Peers
,
for
the
purposes
I
mentioned
?
<EOS>
I
fancy
my
brother
would
give
it
all
the
assistance
he
could
in
the
Lower
House
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
,
"
said
Mr.
B.
,
"
if
I
may
be
allowed
to
speak
in
the
plural
number
,
we
must
not
pretend
to
hold
an
argument
on
this
subject
.
 
<EOS>
What
say
you
,
Mr.
H.
?
<EOS>
Which
side
are
you
of
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Every
gentleman
,
"
replied
he
,
"
who
is
not
of
the
ladies
'
side
,
is
deemed
a
criminal
;
and
I
was
always
of
the
side
that
had
the
power
of
the
gallows
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
shews
,
"
returned
Lady
Towers
,
"
that
Mr.
H.
is
more
afraid
of
the
punishment
,
than
of
deserving
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
"
'
Tis
well
,
"
said
Mr.
B.
,
"
that
any
consideration
deters
a
man
of
Mr.
H.
's
time
of
life
.
<EOS>
What
may
be
fear
now
,
may
improve
to
virtue
in
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
"
said
Lady
Davers
,
"
Jackey
is
one
of
his
uncle
's
foxes
:
he
'd
be
glad
to
snap
up
a
straggling
pullet
,
if
he
was
not
well
looked
after
,
perhaps
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Pray
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Lord
Davers
,
"
<EOS>
forbear
:
<EOS>
you
ought
not
to
introduce
two
different
conversations
into
different
companies
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Well
,
but
,
"
said
Lady
Arthur
,
"
since
you
seem
to
have
been
so
hard
put
to
it
,
as
single
men
,
what
's
to
be
done
with
the
married
man
who
ruins
an
innocent
body
?
 
<EOS>
What
punishment
,
Lady
Towers
,
shall
we
find
out
for
such
an
one
;
and
what
reparation
to
the
injured
?
<EOS>
"
This
was
said
with
a
particular
view
to
the
earl
,
on
a
late
scandalous
occasion
;
as
I
afterwards
found
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
to
the
punishment
of
the
gentleman
,
"
replied
Lady
Towers
,
"
where
the
law
is
not
provided
for
it
,
it
must
be
left
,
I
believe
,
to
his
conscience
.
<EOS>
It
will
then
one
day
be
heavy
enough
.
<EOS>
But
as
to
the
reparation
to
the
woman
,
so
far
as
it
can
be
made
,
it
will
be
determinable
as
the
unhappy
person
may
or
may
not
know
,
that
her
seducer
is
a
married
man
:
if
she
knows
he
is
,
I
think
she
neither
deserves
redress
nor
pity
,
though
it
elevate
not
his
guilt
.
<EOS>
But
if
the
case
be
otherwise
,
and
she
had
no
means
of
informing
herself
that
he
was
married
,
and
he
promised
to
make
her
his
wife
,
to
be
sure
,
though
she
can
not
be
acquitted
,
he
deserves
the
severest
punishment
that
can
be
inflicted
.
 
<EOS>
What
say
you
,
Mrs.
B.
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
must
speak
,
I
think
that
since
custom
now
exacts
so
little
regard
to
virtue
from
men
,
and
so
much
from
women
,
and
since
the
designs
of
the
former
upon
the
latter
are
so
flagrantly
avowed
and
known
,
the
poor
creature
,
who
suffers
herself
to
be
seduced
,
either
by
a
single
or
married
man
,
with
promises
,
or
without
,
has
only
to
sequester
herself
from
the
world
,
and
devote
the
rest
of
her
days
to
penitence
and
obscurity
.
<EOS>
As
to
the
gentleman
,
"
added
I
,
"
he
must
,
I
doubt
,
be
left
to
his
conscience
,
as
you
say
,
Lady
Towers
,
which
he
will
one
day
have
enough
to
do
to
pacify
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Every
young
lady
has
not
your
angelic
perfection
,
Madam
,
"
said
Mr.
Dormer
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
there
are
cases
in
which
the
fair
sex
deserve
compassion
,
ours
execration
.
<EOS>
Love
may
insensibly
steal
upon
a
soft
heart
;
when
once
admitted
,
the
oaths
,
vows
,
and
protestations
of
the
favoured
object
,
who
declaims
against
the
deceivers
of
his
sex
,
confirm
her
good
opinion
of
him
,
till
having
lull'd
asleep
her
vigilance
,
in
an
unguarded
hour
he
takes
advantage
of
her
unsuspecting
innocence
.
<EOS>
Is
not
such
a
poor
creature
to
be
pitied
?
<EOS>
And
what
punishment
does
not
such
a
seducer
deserve
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
put
,
Sir
,
"
said
I
,
"
a
moving
case
,
and
in
a
generous
manner
.
<EOS>
What
,
indeed
,
does
not
such
a
deceiver
deserve
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
the
more
,
"
said
Mrs.
Chapman
,
"
as
the
most
innocent
heart
is
generally
the
most
credulous
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Very
true
,
"
said
my
countess
;
"
for
such
an
one
as
would
do
no
harm
to
others
,
seldom
suspects
any
from
others
;
and
her
lot
is
very
unequally
cast
;
admired
for
that
very
innocence
which
tempts
some
brutal
ravager
to
ruin
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yet
,
what
is
that
virtue
,
"
said
the
dean
,
"
which
can
not
stand
the
test
?
"
  
"
But
,
"
said
Lady
Towers
,
very
satirically
,
"
whither
,
ladies
,
<EOS>
are
we
got
?
<EOS>
We
are
upon
the
subject
of
virtue
and
honour
.
<EOS>
Let
us
talk
of
something
in
which
the
gentlemen
can
join
with
us
.
<EOS>
This
is
such
an
one
,
you
see
,
that
none
but
the
dean
and
Mr.
Dormer
can
discourse
upon
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Let
us
then
,
"
retorted
Mr.
Martin
,
"
to
be
even
with
one
lady
at
least
find
a
subject
that
will
be
new
to
her
:
and
that
is
CHARITY
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Does
what
I
said
concern
Mr.
Martin
more
than
any
other
gentleman
,
"
returned
Lady
Towers
,
"
that
he
is
disposed
to
take
offence
at
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
pardon
me
,
Lady
Towers
,
"
said
Mr.
B.
,
"
but
<EOS>
I
think
a
lady
should
never
make
a
motion
to
wave
such
subjects
as
those
of
virtue
and
honour
;
and
less
still
,
in
company
,
where
there
is
so
much
occasion
,
as
she
seems
to
think
,
for
enforcing
them
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
desire
not
to
wave
the
subject
,
I
'll
assure
you
,
"
replied
she
.
"
<EOS>
And
if
,
Sir
,
you
think
it
may
do
good
,
we
will
continue
it
for
the
sakes
of
all
you
gentlemen
"
(
looking
round
her
archly
)
,
"
who
are
of
opinion
<EOS>
you
may
be
benefited
by
it
.

<EOS>
A
health
to
the
king
and
royal
family
,
brought
on
public
affairs
and
politics
;
and
the
ladies
withdrawing
to
coffee
and
tea
<EOS>
,
I
have
no
more
to
say
as
to
this
conversation
,
having
repeated
all
that
I
remember
was
said
to
any
purpose
.
  
<EOS>
SATURDAY
MORNING
  
<EOS>
The
countess
being
a
little
indisposed
.
<EOS>
Lady
Davers
and
I
took
an
airing
this
morning
in
the
chariot
,
and
had
a
long
discourse
together
.
<EOS>
Her
ladyship
was
pleased
to
express
great
favour
and
tenderness
towards
me
;
gave
me
much
good
advice
,
as
to
the
care
she
would
have
me
take
of
myself
;
and
told
me
,
that
her
hopes
,
as
well
as
her
brother
's
,
all
centred
in
my
welfare
;
and
that
the
way
I
was
in
made
her
love
me
better
and
better
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
pleased
to
tell
me
,
how
much
she
approved
of
the
domestic
management
;
and
to
say
,
that
she
never
saw
such
regularity
and
method
in
any
family
in
her
life
,
where
was
the
like
number
of
servants
:
every
one
,
she
said
,
knew
their
duty
,
and
did
it
without
speaking
to
,
in
such
silence
,
and
with
so
much
apparent
cheerfulness
and
delight
,
without
the
least
hurry
or
confusion
,
that
it
was
her
surprise
and
admiration
:
but
kindly
would
have
it
that
I
took
too
much
care
upon
me
.
"
<EOS>
Yet
,
"
said
she
,
"
I
do
n't
see
<EOS>
but
you
are
always
fresh
and
lively
,
and
never
seem
tired
or
fatigued
;
and
are
always
dressed
and
easy
,
so
that
no
company
find
you
unprepared
,
or
unfit
to
receive
them
,
come
when
they
will
,
whether
it
be
to
breakfast
or
dinner
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
told
her
ladyship
,
I
owed
all
this
and
most
of
the
conduct
for
which
she
was
pleased
to
praise
me
,
to
her
dear
brother
,
who
,
at
the
beginning
of
my
happiness
,
gave
me
several
cautions
and
instructions
for
my
behaviour
;
which
had
been
the
rule
of
my
conduct
ever
since
,
and
I
hoped
ever
would
be
:
 
"
To
say
nothing
,
"
added
I
,
"
which
yet
would
be
very
unjust
,
of
the
assistance
I
received
from
worthy
Mrs.
Jervis
,
who
is
an
excellent
manager
.
"
  
<EOS>
Good
Creature
,
Sweet
Pamela
,
and
Charming
Girl
,
were
her
common
words
;
and
she
was
pleased
to
attribute
to
me
a
graceful
and
unaffected
ease
,
and
that
I
have
a
natural
dignity
in
my
person
and
behaviour
,
which
at
once
command
love
and
reverence
;
so
that
,
my
dear
Miss
Darnford
,
I
am
in
danger
of
being
proud
.
<EOS>
For
you
must
believe
,
that
her
ladyship
's
approbation
gives
me
great
pleasure
;
and
the
more
,
as
I
was
afraid
,
before
she
came
,
I
should
not
have
come
on
near
so
well
in
her
opinion
.
<EOS>
As
the
chariot
passed
along
,
she
took
great
notice
of
the
respects
paid
me
by
people
of
different
ranks
,
and
of
the
blessings
bestowed
upon
me
,
by
several
,
as
we
proceeded
;
and
said
,
she
should
fare
well
,
and
be
rich
in
good
wishes
,
for
being
in
my
company
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
good
people
who
know
us
,
will
do
so
,
Madam
,
"
said
I
;
"
but
I
had
rather
have
their
silent
prayers
than
their
audible
ones
;
and
I
have
caused
some
of
them
to
be
told
so
.
<EOS>
What
I
apprehend
is
,
that
you
will
be
more
uneasy
to
-
morrow
,
when
at
church
you
'll
see
a
good
many
people
in
the
same
way
.
<EOS>
Indeed
my
story
,
and
your
dear
brother
's
tenderness
to
me
,
are
so
much
talked
of
,
that
many
strangers
are
brought
hither
to
see
us
:
'
<EOS>
tis
the
only
thing
,
"
continued
I
<EOS>
(
<EOS>
and
so
it
is
,
Miss
)
<EOS>
,
"
that
makes
me
desirous
to
go
to
London
;
for
by
the
time
we
return
,
the
novelty
,
I
hope
,
will
cease
.
"
<EOS>
Then
I
mentioned
some
verses
of
Mr.
Cowley
,
which
were
laid
under
my
cushion
in
our
seat
at
church
,
two
Sundays
ago
,
by
some
unknown
hand
;
and
how
uneasy
they
have
made
me
.
<EOS>
I
will
transcribe
them
,
my
dear
,
and
give
you
the
particulars
of
our
conversation
on
that
occasion
.
<EOS>
The
verses
are
these
:
    
"
Thou
robb'st
my
days
of
bus'ness
and
delights
,
  
Of
sleep
thou
<EOS>
robb'st
my
nights
.
  
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
lovely
thief
!
<EOS>
what
wilt
thou
do
?
  
<EOS>
What
!
<EOS>
rob
me
of
heaven
too
?
  
<EOS>
Thou
ev'n
my
prayers
dost
<EOS>
steal
from
me
,
  
<EOS>
And
I
,
with
wild
idolatry
,
  
Begin
to
GOD
,
and
end
them
all
to
thee
.
    
<EOS>
No
,
to
what
purpose
should
I
speak
?
  
<EOS>
No
,
wretched
heart
,
swell
till
you
break
.
  
<EOS>
She
can
not
love
me
,
if
she
would
,
  
<EOS>
And
,
to
say
truth
,
'
twere
pity
that
she
should
.
  
<EOS>
No
,
to
the
grave
thy
sorrow
bear
,
  
<EOS>
As
silent
as
they
will
be
there
;
  
Since
that
lov'd
hand
this
mortal
wound
does
give
,
  
<EOS>
So
handsomely
the
thing
contrive
  
<EOS>
That
she
may
guiltless
of
it
live
;
  
<EOS>
So
perish
,
that
her
killing
thee
  
<EOS>
May
a
chance
-
medley
,
and
no
murder
,
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
had
them
in
my
pocket
,
and
read
them
to
my
lady
;
who
asked
me
,
if
her
brother
had
seen
them
?
<EOS>
I
told
her
,
it
was
he
that
found
them
under
the
cushion
I
used
to
sit
upon
;
but
did
not
shew
them
to
me
till
I
came
home
;
and
that
I
was
so
vexed
at
them
,
that
I
could
not
go
to
church
in
the
afternoon
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
should
you
be
vexed
at
,
my
dear
?
"
<EOS>
said
she
:
"
how
could
you
help
it
?
<EOS>
My
brother
was
not
disturbed
at
them
,
was
he
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
indeed
,
"
replied
I
:
"
he
chid
me
for
being
so
;
and
was
pleased
to
make
me
a
fine
compliment
upon
it
;
that
he
did
not
wonder
that
every
body
who
saw
me
loved
me
.
<EOS>
But
I
said
,
this
was
all
that
wicked
wit
is
good
for
,
to
inspire
such
boldness
in
bad
hearts
,
which
might
otherwise
not
dare
to
set
pen
to
paper
to
affront
any
one
.
<EOS>
But
pray
,
Madam
,
"
added
I
,
"
do
n't
own
I
have
told
you
of
them
,
lest
the
least
shadow
of
a
thought
should
arise
,
that
I
was
prompted
by
some
vile
secret
vanity
,
to
tell
your
ladyship
of
them
,
when
I
am
sure
,
they
have
vexed
me
more
than
enough
.
<EOS>
For
is
it
not
a
sad
thing
,
that
the
church
should
be
profaned
by
such
actions
,
and
such
thoughts
,
as
ought
not
to
be
brought
into
it
?
<EOS>
Then
,
Madam
,
to
have
any
wicked
man
dare
to
think
of
one
with
impure
notions
!
<EOS>
It
gives
me
the
less
opinion
of
myself
,
that
I
should
be
so
much
as
thought
of
as
the
object
of
any
wicked
body
's
wishes
.
<EOS>
I
have
called
myself
to
account
upon
it
,
whether
any
levity
in
my
looks
,
my
dress
,
my
appearance
,
could
embolden
such
an
offensive
insolence
.
<EOS>
And
I
have
thought
upon
this
occasion
better
of
Julius
Caesar
's
delicacy
than
I
did
,
when
I
read
of
it
;
who
,
upon
an
attempt
made
on
his
wife
,
to
which
,
however
,
it
does
not
appear
she
gave
the
least
encouragement
,
said
to
those
who
pleaded
for
her
against
the
divorce
he
was
resolved
upon
,
that
the
wife
of
Caesar
ought
not
to
be
suspected
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
Madam
,
"
continued
I
,
"
it
would
extremely
shock
me
,
but
to
know
that
any
wicked
heart
had
conceived
a
design
upon
me
;
upon
me
,
give
me
leave
to
repeat
,
<EOS>
whose
only
glory
and
merit
is
,
that
I
have
had
the
grace
to
withstand
the
greatest
of
trials
and
temptations
,
from
a
gentleman
more
worthy
to
be
beloved
,
both
for
person
and
mind
,
than
any
man
in
England
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Your
observation
,
my
dear
,
is
truly
delicate
,
and
such
as
becomes
your
mind
and
character
.
<EOS>
And
I
really
think
,
if
any
lady
in
the
world
is
secure
from
vile
attempts
,
it
must
be
you
;
not
only
from
your
story
,
so
well
known
,
and
the
love
you
bear
to
your
man
,
and
his
merit
to
you
,
but
from
the
prudence
,
and
natural
dignity
,
I
will
say
,
of
your
behaviour
,
which
,
though
easy
and
cheerful
,
is
what
would
strike
dead
the
hope
of
any
presumptuous
libertine
the
moment
he
sees
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
can
I
enough
,
"
returned
I
,
and
kissed
her
hand
,
"
acknowledge
your
ladyship
's
polite
goodness
in
this
compliment
?
<EOS>
But
,
my
lady
,
you
see
by
the
very
instance
I
have
mentioned
,
that
a
liberty
is
taken
,
which
I
can
not
think
of
without
pain
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
pleased
with
your
delicacy
,
my
dear
,
as
I
said
before
.
<EOS>
You
can
never
err
,
whilst
thus
watchful
over
your
conduct
:
and
I
own
you
have
the
more
reason
for
it
,
as
you
have
married
<EOS>
a
mere
Julius
Caesar
,
an
open
-
eyed
rake
"
(
that
was
her
word
)
,
"
who
would
,
on
the
least
surmise
,
though
ever
so
causeless
on
your
part
,
have
all
his
passions
up
in
arms
,
in
fear
of
liberties
being
offered
like
those
he
has
not
scrupled
to
take
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
O
but
,
Madam
,
"
said
I
,
"
he
has
given
me
great
satisfaction
in
one
point
;
for
you
must
think
I
should
not
love
him
as
I
ought
,
if
I
had
not
a
concern
for
his
future
happiness
,
as
well
as
for
his
present
;
and
that
is
,
he
has
assured
me
,
that
in
all
the
liberties
he
has
taken
,
he
never
attempted
a
married
lady
,
but
always
abhorred
the
thought
of
so
great
an
evil
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
'
Tis
pity
,
"
said
her
ladyship
,
"
that
a
man
who
could
conquer
his
passions
so
far
,
could
not
subdue
them
entirely
.
<EOS>
This
shews
it
was
in
his
own
power
to
do
so
;
and
increases
his
crime
:
and
what
a
wretch
is
he
,
who
scrupling
,
under
pretence
of
conscience
or
honour
,
to
attempt
ladies
within
the
pale
,
boggles
not
to
ruin
a
poor
creature
without
;
although
he
knows
,
he
thereby
,
most
probably
,
for
ever
deprived
her
of
that
protection
,
by
preventing
her
marriage
,
which
even
among
such
rakes
as
himself
,
is
deemed
,
he
owns
,
inviolable
;
and
so
casts
the
poor
creature
headlong
into
the
jaws
of
perdition
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
Madam
,
"
replied
I
,
"
this
was
the
very
inference
I
made
upon
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
what
could
he
say
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
said
,
my
inference
was
just
;
but
called
me
pretty
preacher
;
 
and
once
having
cautioned
me
not
to
be
over
-
serious
to
him
,
so
as
to
cast
a
gloom
,
as
he
said
,
over
our
innocent
enjoyments
,
I
never
dare
to
urge
matters
farther
,
when
he
calls
me
by
that
name
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
said
my
lady
,
"
thou'rt
an
admirable
girl
!
<EOS>
God
's
goodness
was
great
to
our
family
,
when
it
gave
thee
to
it
.
<EOS>
No
wonder
,
"
continued
she
,
"
as
my
brother
says
,
every
body
that
sees
you
,
and
has
heard
your
character
,
loves
you
.
<EOS>
And
this
is
some
excuse
for
the
inconsiderate
folly
even
of
this
unknown
transcriber
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
Madam
,
"
replied
I
,
"
but
is
it
not
a
sad
thing
,
that
people
,
if
they
must
take
upon
them
to
like
one
's
behaviour
in
general
,
should
have
the
worst
,
instead
of
the
best
thoughts
upon
it
?
<EOS>
If
I
were
as
good
as
I
ought
to
be
,
and
as
some
think
me
,
must
they
wish
to
make
me
bad
for
that
reason
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Her
ladyship
was
pleased
to
kiss
me
as
we
sat
.
<EOS>
"
My
charming
Pamela
,
my
more
than
sister
,
.
"
 
(
Did
she
say
?
)
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
she
did
say
so
!
<EOS>
and
made
my
eyes
overflow
with
joy
to
hear
the
sweet
epithet
.

"
<EOS>
How
your
conversation
charms
me
!
 
<EOS>
I
charge
you
,
when
you
get
to
town
,
let
me
have
your
remarks
on
the
diversions
you
will
be
carried
to
by
my
brother
.
<EOS>
Now
I
know
what
to
expect
from
you
,
and
you
know
how
acceptable
every
thing
from
you
will
be
to
me

,
I
promise
great
pleasure
,
as
well
to
myself
as
to
my
worthy
friends
,
particularly
to
Lady
Betty
,
in
your
unrestrained
free
correspondence

<EOS>
Indeed
,
Pamela
,
I
must
bring
you
acquainted
with
Lady
Betty
<EOS>
:
she
is
one
of
the
worthies
of
our
sex
,
and
has
a
fine
understanding
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
sure
you
'll
like
her
.
 
<EOS>
But
(
for
the
world
say
it
not
to
my
brother
,
nor
let
Lady
Betty
know
I
tell
you
so
,
if
ever
you
should
be
acquainted
)
<EOS>
I
had
carried
the
matter
so
far
by
my
officious
zeal
to
have
my
brother
married
to
so
fine
a
lady
,
not
doubting
his
joyful
approbation
,
that
it
was
no
small
disappointment
to
her
,
when
he
married
you
:
and
this
is
the
best
excuse
I
can
make
for
my
furious
behaviour
to
you
at
the
Hall
.
<EOS>
For
though
I
am
naturally
very
hasty
and
passionate
,
yet
then
I
was
almost
mad
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
my
disappointment
had
given
me
so
much
indignation
both
against
you
and
him
,
that
it
is
well
I
did
not
do
some
violent
thing
by
you
.
<EOS>
I
believe
you
did
feel
the
weight
of
my
hand
:
but
what
was
that
?
'
<EOS>
Twas
<EOS>
well
I
did
not
kill
you
dead
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
These
were
her
ladyship
's
words
 
<EOS>
"
For
how
could
I
think
the
wild
libertine
capable
of
being
engaged
by
such
noble
motives
,
or
thee
what
thou
art
!
 
<EOS>
So
this
will
account
to
thee
a
little
for
my
violence
then
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Your
ladyship
,
"
said
I
,
"
all
these
things
considered
,
had
but
too
much
reason
to
be
angry
at
your
dear
brother
's
proceedings
,
so
well
as
you
always
loved
him
,
so
high
a
concern
as
you
always
had
to
promote
his
honour
and
interest
,
and
so
far
as
you
had
gone
with
Lady
Betty
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
tell
thee
,
Pamela
,
that
the
old
story
of
Eleanor
and
Rosamond
run
in
my
head
all
the
way
of
my
journey
,
and
I
almost
wished
for
a
potion
to
force
down
thy
throat
:
when
I
found
thy
lewd
paramour
absent
,
(
for
little
did
I
think
thou
wast
married
to
him
,
though
I
expected
thou
wouldst
try
to
persuade
me
to
believe
it
)
fearing
that
his
intrigue
with
thee
would
effectually
frustrate
my
hopes
as
to
Lady
Betty
and
him
:
<EOS>
"
Now
,
"
thought
I
,
"
all
happens
as
I
wish
!
 
<EOS>
Now
will
I
confront
this
brazen
girl
!
 
<EOS>
Now
will
I
try
her
innocence
,
as
I
please
,
by
offering
to
take
her
away
with
me
;
if
she
refuses
,
take
that
refusal
for
a
demonstration
of
her
guilt
;
and
then
,
"
thought
I
,
"
I
will
make
the
creature
provoke
me
,
in
the
presence
of
my
nephew
and
my
woman
,
"
(
<EOS>
and
I
hoped
to
have
got
that
woman
Jewkes
to
testify
for
me
too
)
,
and
<EOS>
I
can
not
tell
what
I
might
have
done
,
if
thou
hadst
not
escaped
out
of
the
window
,
especially
after
telling
me
thou
wast
as
much
married
as
I
was
,
and
hadst
shewn
me
his
tender
letter
to
thee
,
which
had
a
quite
different
effect
upon
me
than
you
expected
.
<EOS>
But
if
I
had
committed
any
act
of
violence
,
what
remorse
should
I
have
had
on
reflection
,
and
knowing
what
an
excellence
I
had
injured
!
<EOS>
Thank
God
thou
didst
escape
me
!
"
<EOS>
And
then
her
ladyship
folded
her
arms
about
me
,
and
kissed
me
.
  
<EOS>
This
was
a
sad
story
,
you
'll
say
,
my
dear
:
and
I
wonder
what
her
ladyship
's
passion
would
have
made
her
do
!
<EOS>
Surely
she
would
not
have
killed
me
dead
!
<EOS>
Surely
she
would
not
!
 
<EOS>
Let
it
not
,
however
,
Miss
Darnford
 
nor
you
,
<EOS>
my
dear
parents
 
<EOS>
when
you
see
it
 
go
out
of
your
own
hands
,
nor
be
read
,
for
my
Lady
Davers
's
sake
,
to
any
body
else
 
<EOS>
No
,
not
to
your
own
mamma
.
<EOS>
It
made
me
tremble
a
little
,
even
at
this
distance
,
to
think
what
a
sad
thing
passion
is
,
when
way
is
given
to
its
ungovernable
tumults
,
and
how
it
deforms
and
debases
the
noblest
minds
.
  
<EOS>
We
returned
from
this
agreeable
airing
just
in
time
to
dress
before
dinner
,
and
then
my
lady
and
I
went
together
into
the
countess
's
apartment
,
where
I
received
abundance
of
compliments
from
both
.
<EOS>
As
this
brief
conversation
will
give
you
some
notion
of
that
management
and
economy
for
which
they
heaped
upon
me
their
kind
praises
,
I
will
recite
to
you
what
passed
in
it
,
and
hope
you
will
not
think
me
too
vain
;
and
the
less
,
because
what
I
underwent
formerly
from
my
lady
's
indignation
,
half
entitles
me
to
be
proud
of
her
present
kindness
and
favour
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Davers
said
,
"
Your
ladyship
must
excuse
us
,
that
we
have
lost
so
much
of
your
company
;
but
here
,
this
sweet
girl
has
so
entertained
me
,
that
I
could
have
staid
out
with
her
all
day
;
and
several
times
did
I
bid
the
coachman
prolong
his
circuit
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
My
good
Lady
Davers
,
Madam
,
"
said
I
,
"
has
given
me
inexpressible
pleasure
,
and
has
been
all
condescension
and
favour
,
and
made
me
as
proud
as
proud
can
be
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
,
my
dear
Mrs.
B.
,
"
said
she
,
"
may
have
given
great
pleasure
to
Lady
Davers
<EOS>
,
for
it
can
not
be
otherwise
 
<EOS>
But
I
have
no
great
notion
of
her
ladyship
's
condescension
,
as
you
call
it
<EOS>
(
pardon
me
,
Madam
,
"
said
she
to
her
,
smiling
)
"
<EOS>
when
she
can
not
raise
her
style
above
the
word
girl
,
coming
off
from
a
tour
you
have
made
so
delightful
to
her
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
protest
to
you
,
my
Lady
C.
,
"
replied
her
ladyship
,
with
great
goodness
,
"
that
word
,
which
once
I
used
through
pride
,
as
you
'll
call
it
,
I
now
use
for
a
very
different
reason
.
<EOS>
I
begin
to
doubt
,
whether
to
call
her
sister
,
is
not
more
honour
to
myself
than
to
her
;
and
to
this
hour
am
not
quite
<EOS>
convinc'd
.
<EOS>
When
I
am
,
I
will
call
her
so
with
pleasure
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
quite
overcome
with
this
fine
compliment
,
but
could
not
answer
a
word
:
and
the
countess
said
,
"
I
could
have
spared
you
longer
,
had
not
the
time
of
day
compelled
your
return
;
for
I
have
been
very
agreeably
entertained
,
as
well
as
you
,
although
but
with
the
talk
of
your
woman
and
mine
.
<EOS>
For
here
they
have
been
giving
me
such
an
account
of
Mrs.
B.
's
economy
,
and
family
management
,
as
has
highly
delighted
me
.
<EOS>
I
never
knew
the
like
;
and
in
so
young
a
lady
too
.
 
<EOS>
We
shall
have
strange
reformations
to
make
in
our
families
,
Lady
Davers
,
when
we
go
home
,
were
we
to
follow
so
good
an
example
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
my
dear
Mrs.
B.
,
"
continued
her
ladyship
,
"
you
out
-
do
all
your
neighbours
.
<EOS>
And
indeed
I
am
glad
I
live
so
far
from
you
:
 
for
<EOS>
were
I
to
try
to
imitate
you
<EOS>
,
it
would
still
be
but
imitation
,
and
you
'd
have
the
honour
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yet
you
hear
,
and
you
see
by
yesterday
's
conversation
,
"
said
Lady
Davers
,
"
how
much
her
best
neighbours
,
of
both
sexes
,
<EOS>
admire
her
:
they
all
yield
to
her
the
palm
,
unenvying
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
,
my
good
ladies
,
"
said
I
,
<EOS>
"
it
is
a
sign
<EOS>
I
have
most
excellent
neighbours
,
full
of
generosity
,
and
willing
to
encourage
a
young
person
in
doing
right
things
:
so
it
makes
,
considering
what
I
was
,
more
for
their
honour
than
my
own
.
<EOS>
For
what
censures
should
not
such
a
one
as
I
deserve
,
who
have
not
been
educated
to
fill
up
my
time
like
ladies
of
condition
,
were
I
not
to
employ
myself
as
I
do
?
<EOS>
I
,
who
have
so
little
other
merit
,
and
who
brought
no
fortune
at
all
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Come
,
come
,
Pamela
,
none
of
your
self
-
denying
ordinances
,
"
that
was
Lady
Davers
's
word
;
"
you
must
know
something
of
your
own
excellence
:
if
you
do
not
,
I
'll
tell
it
you
,
because
there
is
no
fear
you
will
be
proud
or
vain
upon
it
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
see
,
then
,
that
there
is
the
lady
in
yours
,
or
any
neighbourhood
<EOS>
,
that
behaves
with
more
decorum
,
or
better
keeps
up
the
part
of
a
lady
,
than
you
do
.
<EOS>
How
you
manage
it
,
I
ca
n't
tell
;
but
you
do
as
much
by
a
look
,
and
a
pleasant
one
too
,
that
's
the
rarity
!
<EOS>
as
I
do
by
high
words
,
and
passionate
exclamations
:
I
have
often
nothing
but
blunder
upon
blunder
,
as
if
the
wretches
were
in
a
confederacy
to
try
my
patience
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
,
"
said
I
,
"
the
awe
they
have
of
your
ladyship
,
because
of
your
high
qualities
,
makes
them
commit
blunders
;
for
I
myself
was
always
more
afraid
of
appearing
before
your
ladyship
,
when
you
have
visited
your
honoured
mother
,
than
of
any
body
else
,
and
have
been
the
more
sensibly
awkward
through
that
very
awful
respect
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Psha
,
psha
,
Pamela
,
that
is
not
it
:
'
tis
all
in
yourself
.
<EOS>
I
used
to
think
my
mamma
,
and
my
brother
too
,
had
as
awkward
servants
as
ever
<EOS>
I
saw
any
<EOS>
where
 
except
Mrs.
Jervis
 
Well
enough
for
a
bachelor
,
indeed
!
 
<EOS>
But
,
here
!
 
<EOS>
thou
hast
not
parted
with
one
servant
 
Hast
thou
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
Madam
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
How
!
"
said
the
countess
;
"
what
excellence
is
here
!
 
<EOS>
All
of
them
,
pardon
me
,
Mrs.
B.
,
your
fellow
-
servants
,
as
one
may
say
,
and
all
of
them
so
respectful
,
so
watchful
of
your
eye
;
and
you
,
at
the
same
time
,
so
gentle
to
them
,
so
easy
,
so
cheerful
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
think
me
,
my
dear
,
insufferably
vain
?
<EOS>
But
'
tis
what
they
were
pleased
to
say
.
'
<EOS>
Twas
their
goodness
to
me
,
and
shewed
how
much
they
can
excel
in
generous
politeness
.
<EOS>
So
I
will
proceed
.
<EOS>
"
Why
this
,
"
continued
the
countess
,
"
must
be
born
dignity
 
born
discretion
 
Education
can
not
give
it
:
 
if
it
could
,
why
should
not
we
have
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
ladies
said
many
more
kind
things
of
me
then
;
and
after
dinner
they
mentioned
all
over
again
,
with
additions
,
before
my
best
friend
,
who
was
kindly
delighted
with
the
encomiums
given
me
by
two
ladies
of
such
distinguishing
judgment
in
all
other
cases
.
<EOS>
They
told
him
,
how
much
they
admired
my
family
management
:
then
they
would
have
it
that
my
genius
was
universal
,
for
the
employments
and
accomplishments
of
my
sex
,
whether
they
considered
it
as
employed
in
penmanship
,
in
needlework
,
in
paying
or
receiving
visits
,
in
music
,
and
I
ca
n't
tell
how
many
other
qualifications
,
which
they
were
pleased
to
attribute
to
me
,
over
and
above
the
family
management
:
saying
,
that
I
had
an
understanding
which
comprehended
every
thing
,
and
an
eye
that
penetrated
into
the
very
bottom
of
matters
in
a
moment
,
and
never
was
at
a
loss
for
the
should
be
,
<EOS>
the
why
or
wherefore
,
and
the
how
 
these
were
their
comprehensive
words
;
that
I
did
every
thing
with
celerity
,
clearing
all
as
I
went
,
and
left
nothing
,
they
observed
,
to
come
over
again
,
that
could
be
dispatched
at
once
:
by
which
means
,
they
said
,
every
hand
was
clear
to
undertake
a
new
work
,
as
well
as
my
own
head
to
direct
it
;
and
there
was
no
hurry
nor
confusion
:
but
every
coming
hour
was
fresh
and
ready
,
and
unincumbered
(
so
they
said
)
,
for
its
new
employment
;
and
to
this
they
attributed
that
ease
and
pleasure
with
which
every
thing
was
performed
,
and
that
I
could
do
and
cause
to
be
done
,
so
much
business
without
hurry
either
to
myself
or
servants
.
  
<EOS>
Judge
<EOS>
how
pleasing
this
was
to
my
best
beloved
,
who
found
,
in
their
kind
approbation
,
such
a
justification
of
his
own
conduct
as
could
not
fail
of
being
pleasing
to
him
,
especially
as
Lady
Davers
was
one
of
the
kind
praisers
.
<EOS>
Lord
Davers
was
so
highly
delighted
,
that
he
rose
once
,
begging
his
brother
's
excuse
,
to
salute
me
,
and
stood
over
my
chair
,
with
a
pleasure
in
his
looks
that
can
not
be
expressed
,
now
-
and
-
then
lifting
up
his
hands
,
and
his
good
-
natured
eye
glistening
with
joy
,
which
a
pier
-
glass
gave
me
the
opportunity
of
seeing
,
as
sometimes
I
stole
a
bashful
glance
towards
it
,
not
knowing
how
or
which
way
to
look
.
<EOS>
Even
Mr.
H.
seemed
to
be
touched
very
sensibly
;
and
recollecting
his
behaviour
to
me
at
the
Hall
,
he
once
cried
out
,
"
What
a
sad
whelp
was
I
,
to
behave
as
I
formerly
did
,
to
so
much
excellence
!
 
<EOS>
Not
,
Mr.
B.
,
that
I
was
any
thing
uncivil
neither
;
 
but
in
unworthy
sneers
,
and
nonsense
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
me
well
enough
.
 
<EOS>
You
called
me
,
<EOS>
tinsell'd
boy
,
though
,
Madam
,
do
n't
you
remember
that
?
and
said
,
twenty
or
thirty
years
hence
,
when
I
was
at
age
,
you
'd
give
me
an
answer
.
<EOS>
Egad
!
<EOS>
I
shall
never
forget
your
looks
,
nor
your
words
neither
!
 
<EOS>
they
were
severe
speeches
,
were
they
not
,
Sir
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
O
you
see
,
Mr.
H.
,
"
replied
my
dear
Mr.
B.
,

Pamela
is
not
quite
perfect
.
<EOS>
We
must
not
provoke
her
;
for
she
'll
call
us
both
so
,
perhaps
;
for
I
wear
a
laced
coat
,
sometimes
,
as
well
as
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
I
ca

be
angry

said
he
.
<EOS>
"
I
deserved
it
richly

that
I

had
it

<EOS>
"
Thy
silly
tongue

"
said
my
lady
,
"
runs
on
without
fear
or

<EOS>
What
's
past
is
past

"
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
Madam
,
I
was
plaguily
wrong
;
and
I
said
nothing
of
any
body
but
myself
:
 
and
have
been
ready
to
hang
myself
since
,
as
often
as
I
have
thought
of
my

<EOS>
"
My

said
my
lord

"
must
bring
in
hanging

or
the
gallows
in
every
speech
he
makes
,
or
it
will
not
be

"
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
,
smiling
,
said
,
with
severity
enough
in
his
meaning
,
as
I
saw
by
the
turn
of
his
countenance
,
"
Mr.
H.
knows
that
his
birth
and
family
entitle
him
more
to
the
block

he

not

so
free
with
the
latter

"
 
<EOS>
"
Good
!
<EOS>
very
good

by

"
said
Mr.
H.
laughing
.
<EOS>
The
countess
smiled
.
<EOS>
Lady
Davers
shook
her
head
at
her
brother
,
and
said
to
her
nephew
,
"
Thou'rt
a
good
-
natured
foolish
fellow
,
that
thou
art
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
For
what
,
Madam
?
<EOS>
Why
the
word
foolish
,
aunt
?
<EOS>
What
have
I
said
now
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nothing
to
any
purpose

indeed
,
"
said
she
;
"
when
thou
dost
,
I
'll
write
it
down
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
,
Madam
,
"
said
he
,
"
have
your
pen
and
ink
always
about
you
,
when
I
am
present
;
and
put
that
down
to
begin
with
!
"
<EOS>
This
made
every
one
laugh
.
<EOS>
"
What
a
happy
thing
is
it
,
"
thought
I
,
"
that
good
nature
generally
accompanies
this
character
;
else
,
how
would
some
people
be
supportable
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
But
here
I
'll
break
off
.
'
<EOS>
Tis
time
,
you
'll
say
.
<EOS>
But
you
know
to
whom
I
write
,
as
well
as
to
yourself
,
and
they
'll
be
pleased
with
all
my
silly
scribble
.
<EOS>
So
excuse
one
part
for
that
,
and
another
for
friendship
's
sake
,
and
then
I
shall
be
wholly
excusable
to
you
.
  
<EOS>
Now
the
trifler
again
resumes
her
pen
.
<EOS>
I
am
in
some
pain
,
Miss
,
for
to
-
morrow
,
because
of
the
rules
we
observe
of
late
in
our
family
on
Sundays
,
and
of
going
through
a
crowd
to
church
;
which
will
afford
new
scenes
to
our
noble
visitors
,
either
for
censure
or
otherwise
:
but
I
will
sooner
be
censured
for
doing
what
I
think
my
duty
,
than
for
the
want
of
it
;
and
so
will
omit
nothing
that
we
have
been
accustomed
to
do
.
  
<EOS>
I
hope
I
shall
not
be
thought
ridiculous
,
or
as
one
who
aims
at
works
of
supererogation
,
for
what
I
think
is
very
short
of
my
duty
.
<EOS>
Some
order
,
surely
,
becomes
the
heads
of
families
;
and
besides
,
it
would
be
discrediting
one
's
own
practice
,
if
one
did
not
appear
at
one
time
what
one
does
at
another
.
<EOS>
For
that
which
is
a
reason
for
discontinuing
a
practice
for
some
company
,
would
seem
to
be
a
reason
for
laying
it
aside
for
ever
,
especially
in
a
family
visiting
and
visited
as
ours
.
<EOS>
And
I
remember
well
a
hint
given
me
by
my
dearest
friend
once
on
another
subject
,
that
it
is
in
every
one
's
power
to
prescribe
rules
to
himself
,
after
a
while
,
and
persons
to
see
what
is
one
's
way
,
and
that
one
is
not
to
be
put
out
of
it
.
<EOS>
But
my
only
doubt
is
,
that
to
ladies
,
who
have
not
been
accustomed
perhaps
to
the
necessary
strictness
,
I
should
make
myself
censurable
,
as
if
I
aimed
at
too
much
perfection
:
for
,
however
one
's
duty
is
one
's
duty
,
and
ought
not
to
be
dispensed
with
;
yet
,
when
a
person
,
who
uses
to
be
remiss
,
sees
so
hard
a
task
before
them
,
and
so
many
great
points
to
get
over
,
all
to
be
no
more
than
tolerably
regular
<EOS>
,
it
is
rather
apt
to
frighten
and
discourage
,
than
to
allure
;
and
one
must
proceed
,
as
I
have
read
soldiers
do
,
in
a
difficult
siege
,
inch
by
inch
,
and
be
more
studious
to
entrench
and
fortify
themselves
,
as
they
go
on
gaining
upon
the
enemy
,
than
by
rushing
all
at
once
upon
an
attack
of
the
place
,
be
repulsed
,
and
perhaps
obliged
with
great
loss
to
abandon
a
hopeful
enterprise
.
<EOS>
And
permit
me
to
add
,
that
young
as
I
am
,
I
have
often
observed
,
that
over
-
great
strictnesses
all
at
once
enjoined
and
insisted
upon
,
are
not
fit
for
a
beginning
reformation
,
but
for
stronger
Christians
only
;
and
therefore
generally
do
more
harm
than
good
.
  
<EOS>
But
shall
I
not
be
too
grave
,
<EOS>
my
dear
friend
?
 
<EOS>
Excuse
me
;
for
this
is
Saturday
night
:
<EOS>
and
as
it
was
a
very
good
method
which
the
ingenious
authors
of
the
Spectator
took
,
generally
to
treat
their
more
serious
subjects
on
this
day
;
so
I
think
one
should
,
when
one
can
,
consider
it
as
the
preparative
eve
to
a
still
better
.
  
<EOS>
SUNDAY
.
  
<EOS>
Now
,
my
dear
,
by
what
I
have
already
written
,
it
is
become
in
a
manner
necessary
to
acquaint
you
briefly
with
the
method
<EOS>
my
dear
Mr.
B.
not
only
permits
,
but
encourages
me
to
take
,
in
the
family
he
leaves
to
my
care
,
as
to
the
Sunday
duty
.
  
<EOS>
The
worthy
dean
,
at
my
request
,
and
my
beloved
's
permission
,
recommended
to
me
,
as
a
sort
of
family
chaplain
,
for
Sundays
,
a
young
gentleman
of
great
sobriety
and
piety
,
and
sound
principles
,
who
having
but
lately
taken
orders
,
has
at
present
no
other
provision
.
<EOS>
And
this
gentleman
comes
,
and
reads
prayers
to
us
about
seven
in
the
morning
,
in
the
lesser
hall
,
as
we
call
it
,
a
retired
apartment
,
next
the
little
garden
;
for
we
have
no
chapel
with
us
here
,
as
in
your
neighbourhood
;
and
this
generally
,
with
some
suitable
exhortation
,
or
meditation
out
of
some
good
book
,
which
he
is
so
kind
as
to
let
me
choose
now
-
and
-
then
,
when
I
please
,
takes
up
little
more
than
half
an
hour
.
<EOS>
We
have
a
great
number
of
servants
of
both
sexes
:
and
myself
,
Mrs.
Jervis
,
and
Polly
Barlow
,
are
generally
in
a
little
closet
,
which
,
when
we
open
the
door
,
is
but
just
a
separation
from
the
hall
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Adams
(
for
that
is
our
young
clergyman
's
name
)
has
a
desk
at
which
sometimes
Mr.
Jonathan
makes
up
his
running
accounts
to
Mr.
Longman
,
who
is
very
scrupulous
of
admitting
any
body
to
the
use
of
his
office
,
because
of
the
writing
in
his
custody
,
and
the
order
he
values
himself
upon
having
every
thing
in
.
<EOS>
About
seven
in
the
evening
he
comes
again
,
and
I
generally
,
let
me
have
what
company
I
will
,
find
time
to
retire
for
about
another
half
hour
;
and
my
dear
Mr.
B.
connives
at
,
and
excuses
my
absence
,
if
enquired
after
;
though
for
so
short
a
time
,
I
am
seldom
missed
.
  
<EOS>
To
the
young
gentleman
I
shall
present
,
every
quarter
,
five
guineas
,
and
Mr.
B.
presses
him
to
accept
of
a
place
at
his
table
at
his
pleasure
:
but
,
as
we
have
generally
much
company
,
his
modesty
makes
him
decline
it
,
especially
at
those
times
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Longman
joins
with
us
very
often
in
our
Sunday
office
,
and
Mr.
Colbrand
seldom
misses
:
<EOS>
and
they
tell
Mrs.
Jervis
that
they
can
not
express
the
pleasure
they
have
to
meet
me
there
;
and
the
edification
they
receive
.
  
<EOS>
My
best
beloved
dispenses
as
much
as
he
can
with
the
servants
,
for
the
evening
part
,
if
he
has
company
;
or
will
be
attended
only
by
John
or
Abraham
,
perhaps
by
turns
;
and
sometimes
looks
upon
his
watch
,
and
says
,
"
'
Tis
near
seven
;
"
and
if
he
says
so
,
they
take
it
for
a
hint
that
they
may
be
dispensed
with
for
half
an
hour
;
and
this
countenance
which
he
gives
me
,
has
contributed
not
a
little
to
make
the
matter
easy
and
delightful
to
me
,
and
to
every
one
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
part
from
them
,
on
the
breaking
up
of
our
assembly
,
they
generally
make
a
little
row
on
each
side
of
the
hall
-
door
;
and
when
I
have
made
my
compliments
,
and
paid
my
thanks
to
Mr.
Adams
,
they
whisper
,
as
I
go
out
,
"
God
bless
you
,
Madam
!
"
and
bow
and
curtsey
with
such
pleasure
in
their
honest
countenances
as
greatly
delights
me
:
<EOS>
and
I
say
,
"
So
my
good
friends
 
I
am
glad
to
see
you
 
Not
one
absent
!
"
<EOS>
or
but
one
(
as
it
falls
out
)
 
<EOS>
"
This
is
very
obliging
,
"
I
cry
:
and
thus
I
shew
them
,
that
I
take
notice
,
if
any
body
be
not
there
.
<EOS>
And
back
again
I
go
to
pay
my
duty
to
my
earthly
benefactor
:
and
he
is
pleased
to
say
sometimes
,
that
I
come
to
him
with
such
a
radiance
in
my
countenance
,
as
gives
him
double
pleasure
to
behold
me
;
and
often
tells
me
,
that
but
for
appearing
too
fond
before
company
,
he
could
meet
me
as
I
enter
,
with
embraces
as
pure
as
my
own
heart
.
  
<EOS>
I
hope
in
time
,
I
shall
prevail
upon
the
dear
man
to
give
me
his
company
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
thank
God
,
I
am
enabled
to
go
thus
far
already
!
 
<EOS>
I
will
leave
the
rest
to
his
providence
.
<EOS>
For
I
have
a
point
very
delicate
to
touch
upon
in
this
particular
;
and
I
must
take
care
not
to
lose
the
ground
I
have
gained
,
by
too
precipitately
pushing
at
too
much
at
once
.
<EOS>
This
is
my
comfort
,
that
next
to
being
uniform
himself
,
is
that
permission
and
encouragement
he
gives
me
to
be
so
,
and
his
pleasure
in
seeing
me
so
delighted
 
and
besides
,
he
always
gives
me
his
company
to
church
.
<EOS>
O
how
happy
should
I
think
myself
,
if
he
would
be
pleased
to
accompany
me
to
the
divine
office
,
which
yet
he
has
not
done
,
though
I
have
urged
him
as
much
as
I
durst
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jervis
asked
me
on
Saturday
evening
,
if
I
would
be
concerned
to
see
a
larger
congregation
in
the
lesser
hall
next
morning
than
usual
?
<EOS>
I
answered
,
"
No
,
by
no
means
.
"
<EOS>
She
said
,
Mrs.
Worden
,
and
Mrs.
Lesley
(
the
two
ladies
'
women
)
,
and
Mr.
Sidney
,
my
Lord
Davers
's
gentleman
,
and
Mr.
H."s
servant
,
and
the
coachmen
and
footmen
belonging
to
our
noble
visitors
,
who
are
,
she
says
,
all
great
admirers
of
our
family
management
and
good
order
,
having
been
told
our
method
,
begged
to
join
in
it
.
<EOS>
I
knew
I
should
be
a
little
dashed
at
so
large
a
company
;
but
the
men
being
orderly
for
lords
"
servants
,
and
Mrs.
Jervis
assuring
me
that
they
were
very
earnest
in
their
request
,
I
consented
to
it
.
  
<EOS>
When
,
at
the
usual
time
,
(
with
my
Polly
)
I
went
down
,
I
found
Mr.
Adams
here
(
to
whom
I
made
my
first
compliments
)
,
and
every
one
of
our
own
people
waiting
for
me
,
Mr.
Colbrand
excepted
(
whom
Mr.
H.
had
kept
up
late
the
night
before
)
,
together
with
Mrs.
Worden
and
Mrs.
Lesley
,
and
Mr.
Sidney
,
with
the
servants
of
our
guests
,
who
,
as
also
worthy
Mr.
Longman
,
and
Mrs.
Jervis
,
and
Mr.
Jonathan
,
paid
me
their
respects
:
and
I
said
,
"
This
is
early
rising
,
Mrs.
Lesley
and
Mrs.
Worden
;
you
are
very
kind
to
countenance
us
with
your
companies
in
this
our
family
order
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Sidney
,
I
am
glad
to
see
you
.
 
<EOS>
How
do
you
do
,
Mr.
Longman
?
"
and
looked
round
with
complacency
on
the
servants
of
our
noble
visitors
.
<EOS>
And
then
I
led
Mrs.
Worden
and
Mrs.
Lesley
to
my
little
retiring
place
,
and
Mrs.
Jervis
and
my
Polly
followed
;
and
throwing
the
door
open
,
Mr.
Adams
began
some
select
prayers
;
and
as
he
reads
with
great
emphasis
and
propriety
,
as
if
his
heart
was
in
what
he
read
,
all
the
good
folks
were
exceedingly
attentive
.
 
<EOS>
After
prayers
,
Mr.
Adams
reads
a
meditation
,
from
a
collection
made
for
private
use
,
which
I
shall
more
particularly
mention
by
-
and
-
by
;
and
ending
with
the
usual
benediction
,
I
thanked
the
worthy
gentleman
,
and
gently
chid
him
in
Mr.
B.
's
name
,
for
his
modesty
in
declining
our
table
;
and
thanking
Mr.
Longman
,
Mrs.
Worden
,
and
Mrs.
Lesley
,
received
their
kind
wishes
,
and
hastened
,
blushing
through
their
praises
,
to
my
chamber
,
where
,
being
alone
,
I
pursued
the
subject
for
an
hour
,
till
breakfast
was
ready
,
when
I
attended
the
ladies
,
and
my
best
beloved
,
who
had
told
them
of
the
verses
placed
under
my
cushion
at
church
.
 
<EOS>
We
set
out
,
my
Lord
and
Lady
Davers
,
and
myself
,
and
Mr.
H.
in
our
coach
,
and
Mr.
B.
and
the
countess
in
the
chariot
;
both
ladies
and
the
gentlemen
splendidly
dressed
;
but
I
avoided
a
glitter
as
much
as
I
could
,
that
I
might
not
seem
to
vie
with
the
two
peeresses
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
said
,
"
Why
are
you
not
full
-
dressed
,
my
dear
?
"
<EOS>
I
said
,
I
hoped
he
would
not
be
displeased
;
if
he
was
,
I
would
do
as
he
commanded
.
<EOS>
He
kindly
answered
,
"
As
you
like
best
,
my
love
.
<EOS>
You
are
charming
in
every
dress
.

<EOS>
The
chariot
first
drawing
up
to
the
church
door
,
Mr.
B.
led
the
countess
into
church
.
<EOS>
My
Lord
Davers
did
me
that
honour
;
and
Mr.
H.
handed
his
aunt
through
a
crowd
of
gazers
,
many
of
whom
,
as
usual
,
were
strangers
.
<EOS>
The
neighbouring
gentlemen
and
their
ladies
paid
us
their
silent
respects
;
but
the
thoughts
of
the
wicked
verses
,
or
rather
,
as
Lady
Davers
will
have
me
say
,
wicked
action
of
the
transcriber
of
them
,
made
me
keep
behind
the
pew
;
but
my
lady
sat
down
by
me
,
and
whisperingly
talked
between
whiles
,
to
me
,
with
great
tenderness
and
freedom
in
her
aspect
;
which
I
could
not
but
take
kindly
,
because
I
knew
she
intended
by
it
,
to
shew
every
one
she
was
pleased
with
me
.
  
<EOS>
Afterwards
she
was
pleased
to
add
,
taking
my
hand
,
and
Mr.
B.
and
the
countess
heard
her
(
for
she
raised
her
voice
to
a
more
audible
whisper
)
<EOS>
,
"
I
'm
proud
to
be
in
thy
company
,
and
in
this
solemn
place
,
I
take
thy
hand
,
and
acknowledge
with
pride
,
my
sister
.
<EOS>
"
I
looked
down
;
and
indeed
,
at
church
,
I
can
hardly
at
any
time
look
up
;
for
who
can
bear
to
be
gazed
at
so
?
 
and
softly
said
,
"
Oh
!
<EOS>
my
good
lady
!
<EOS>
how
much
you
honour
me
;
the
place
,
and
these
surrounding
eyes
,
can
only
hinder
me
from
acknowledging
as
I
ought
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
My
best
friend
,
with
pleasure
in
his
eyes
,
said
,
pressing
his
hand
upon
both
ours
,
as
my
lady
had
mine
in
hers
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
two
beloved
creatures
:
both
excellent
in
your
way
.
<EOS>
God
bless
you
both
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
you
too
,
my
dear
brother
,
"
said
my
lady
.
  
<EOS>
The
countess
whispered
,
"
You
should
spare
a
body
a
little
!
<EOS>
You
give
one
,
ladies
,
and
Mr.
B.
,
too
much
pleasure
all
at
once
.
<EOS>
Such
company
,
and
such
behaviour
adds
still
more
charms
to
devotion
;
and
were
I
to
be
here
a
twelvemonth
,
I
would
never
miss
once
accompanying
you
to
this
good
place
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
H.
thought
he
must
say
something
,
and
addressing
himself
to
his
noble
uncle
,
who
could
not
keep
his
good
-
natured
eye
off
me
 
<EOS>
"
I
'll
be
hang'd
,
my
lord
,
if
I
know
how
to
behave
myself
!
<EOS>
Why
this
outdoes
the
chapel
!
 
<EOS>
I
'm
glad
I
put
on
my
new
suit
!
"
<EOS>
And
then
he
looked
upon
himself
,
as
if
he
would
support
,
as
well
as
he
could
,
his
part
of
the
general
admiration
.
  
<EOS>
But
think
you
not
,
my
dear
Miss
Darnford
,
and
my
dearest
father
and
mother
,
that
I
am
now
in
the
height
of
my
happiness
in
this
life
,
thus
favoured
by
Lady
Davers
?
<EOS>
The
dean
preached
an
excellent
sermon
;
but
I
need
not
have
said
that
;
only
to
have
mentioned
,
that
he
preached
,
was
saying
enough
.
  
<EOS>
My
lord
led
me
out
when
divine
service
was
over
;
and
being
a
little
tender
in
his
feet
,
from
a
gouty
notice
,
walked
very
slowly
.
<EOS>
Lady
Towers
and
Mrs.
Brooks
joined
us
in
the
porch
,
and
made
us
their
compliments
,
as
did
Mr.
Martin
.
<EOS>
"
Will
you
favour
us
with
your
company
home
,
my
old
acquaintance
?
"
said
Mr.
B.
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
,
having
a
gentleman
,
my
relation
,
to
dine
with
me
;
but
if
it
will
be
agreeable
in
the
evening
,
I
will
bring
him
with
me
to
taste
of
your
Burgundy
:
for
we
have
not
any
such
in
the
county
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
glad
to
see
you
,
or
any
friend
of
yours
,
"
replied
Mr.
B.
  
Mr.
Martin
whispered
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
more
,
however
,
to
admire
your
lady
,
I
can
tell
you
that
,
than
your
wine.-Get
into
your
coaches
,
ladies
,
"
said
he
,
with
his
usual
freedom
;
"
our
maiden
and
widow
ladies
have
a
fine
time
of
it
,
wherever
you
come
:
by
my
faith
they
must
every
one
of
them
quit
this
neighbourhood
,
if
you
were
to
stay
in
it
:
but
all
their
hopes
are
,
that
while
you
are
in
London
,
they
'll
have
the
game
in
their
own
hands
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Sister
,
"
said
Lady
Davers
,
most
kindly
to
me
,
in
presence
of
many
,
who
(
in
a
respectful
manner
)
gathered
near
us
,
"
Mr.
Martin
is
the
same
gentleman
he
used
to
be
,
I
see
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Martin
,
Madam
,
"
said
I
,
smiling
,
"
has
but
one
fault
:
<EOS>
he
is
too
apt
to
praise
whom
he
favours
,
at
the
expense
of
his
absent
friends
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
always
proud
of
your
reproofs
,
Mrs.
B.
,
"
replied
he
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
"
said
Lady
Towers
,
"
that
I
believe
.
 
<EOS>
And
,
therefore
,
I
wish
,
for
all
our
sakes
,
you
'd
take
him
oftener
to
task
,
Mrs.
B.
"
  
Lady
Towers
,
Lady
Arthur
,
Mrs.
Brooks
,
and
Mr.
Martin
,
all
claimed
visits
from
us
;
and
Mr.
B.
making
excuses
,
that
he
must
husband
his
time
,
being
obliged
to
go
to
town
soon
,
proposed
to
breakfast
with
Lady
Towers
the
next
morning
,
dine
with
Mrs.
Arthur
,
and
sup
with
Mrs.
Brooks
;
and
as
there
can
not
be
a
more
social
and
agreeable
neighbourhood
any
where
,
his
proposal
,
after
some
difficulty
,
was
accepted
;
and
our
usual
visiting
neighbours
were
all
to
have
notice
accordingly
,
at
each
of
the
places
.
  
<EOS>
I
saw
Sir
Thomas
Atkyns
coming
towards
us
,
and
fearing
to
be
stifled
with
compliments
,
I
said
 
"
Your
servant
,
ladies
and
gentlemen
;
"
and
giving
my
hand
to
Lord
Davers
,
stept
into
the
chariot
,
instead
of
the
coach
;
for
people
that
would
avoid
bustle
,
sometimes
make
it
.
<EOS>
Finding
my
mistake
,
I
would
have
come
out
,
but
my
lord
said
,
"
Indeed
you
sha
n't
:
for
I
'll
step
in
,
and
have
you
all
to
myself
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lady
Davers
smiled
 
"
Now
,
"
said
she
(
while
the
coach
drew
up
)
,
"
is
my
Lord
Davers
pleased
;
 
but
I
see
,
sister
,
you
were
tired
with
part
of
your
company
in
the
coach
.
<EOS>
"
 
"
'
Tis
well
contrived
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Mr.
B.
,
"
as
long
as
you
have
not
deprived
me
of
this
honour
;
"
taking
the
countess
's
hand
,
and
leading
her
into
the
coach
.
  
<EOS>
Will
you
excuse
all
this
impertinence
,
my
dear
?
 
<EOS>
I
know
my
father
and
mother
will
be
pleased
with
it
;
and
you
will
therefore
bear
with
me
;
for
their
kind
hearts
will
be
delighted
to
hear
every
minute
thing
in
relation
to
Lady
Davers
and
myself
.
 
<EOS>
When
Mr.
Martin
came
in
the
evening
,
with
his
friend
(
who
is
Sir
William
G.
,
a
polite
young
gentleman
of
Lincolnshire
)
,
he
told
us
of
the
praises
lavished
away
upon
me
by
several
genteel
strangers
;
one
saying
to
his
friend
,
he
had
travelled
twenty
miles
to
see
me
.
 
<EOS>
My
Lady
Davers
was
praised
too
for
her
goodness
to
me
,
and
the
gracefulness
of
her
person
;
the
countess
for
the
noble
serenity
of
her
aspect
,
and
that
charming
ease
and
freedom
,
which
distinguished
her
birth
and
quality
.
<EOS>
My
dear
Mr.
B.
,
he
said
,
was
greatly
admired
too
:
but
he
would
not
make
him
proud
;
for
he
had
superiorities
enough
already
,
that
was
his
word
,
over
his
neighbours
:
<EOS>
"
But
I
can
tell
you
,
"
said
he
,
"
that
for
most
of
your
praises
you
are
obliged
to
your
lady
,
and
for
having
rewarded
her
excellence
as
you
have
done
:
for
one
gentleman
,
"
added
he
,
"
said
,
he
knew
no
one
<EOS>
but
you
could
deserve
her
;
and
he
believed
you
did
,
from
that
tenderness
in
your
behaviour
to
her
,
and
from
that
grandeur
of
air
,
and
majesty
of
person
,
that
seemed
to
shew
you
formed
for
her
protector
,
as
well
as
rewarder
.
 
<EOS>
Get
<EOS>
you
gone
to
London
,
both
of
you
,
"
said
he
.
<EOS>
"
I
did
not
intend
to
tell
you
,
Mr.
B.
,
what
was
said
of
you
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
women
of
the
two
ladies
had
acquainted
their
ladyships
with
the
order
I
observed
for
the
day
,
and
the
devout
behaviour
of
the
servants
.
<EOS>
And
about
seven
,
I
withdrawing
as
silently
and
as
unobserved
as
I
could
,
was
surprised
,
as
I
was
going
through
the
great
hall
,
to
be
joined
by
both
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
come
at
all
your
secrets
,
Pamela
,
"
said
my
lady
,
"
and
be
able
,
in
time
,
to
cut
you
out
in
your
own
way
.
<EOS>
I
know
whither
you
are
going
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
good
ladies
,
"
said
I
,
"
pardon
me
for
leaving
you
.
<EOS>
I
will
attend
you
in
half
an
hour
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Lady
Davers
,
"
the
countess
and
I
have
resolved
to
attend
you
for
that
half
hour
,
and
we
will
return
to
company
together
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Is
it
not
descending
too
much
,
my
ladies
,
as
to
the
company
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
If
it
is
for
us
,
it
is
for
you
,
"
said
the
countess
;
"
<EOS>
so
we
will
either
act
up
to
you
,
or
make
you
come
down
to
us
;
and
we
will
judge
of
all
your
proceedings
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Every
one
,
but
Abraham
(
who
attended
the
gentlemen
)
,
and
all
their
ladyships
'
servants
,
and
their
two
women
,
were
there
;
which
pleased
me
,
however
,
because
it
shewed
,
that
even
the
strangers
,
by
this
their
second
voluntary
attendance
,
had
no
ill
opinion
of
the
service
.
<EOS>
But
they
were
all
startled
,
ours
and
theirs
,
to
see
the
ladies
accompanying
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
stept
up
to
Mr.
Adams
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
was
in
hopes
.
<EOS>
Sir
,
"
said
I
,
"
we
should
have
been
favoured
with
your
company
at
our
table
.
"
<EOS>
He
bowed
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Sir
,
"
said
I
,
"
these
ladies
come
to
be
obliged
to
you
for
your
good
offices
;
and
you
'll
have
no
better
way
of
letting
them
return
their
obligations
,
than
to
sup
,
though
you
would
not
dine
with
them
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Longman
,
"
said
my
lady
,
"
how
do
you
do
?
 
<EOS>
We
are
come
to
be
witnesses
of
the
family
decorum
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
We
have
a
blessed
lady
,
Madam
,
"
said
he
:
"
and
your
ladyship
's
presence
augments
our
joys
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
should
have
said
,
we
were
not
at
church
in
the
afternoon
;
and
when
I
do
not
go
,
we
have
the
evening
service
read
to
us
,
as
it
is
at
church
;
which
Mr.
Adams
performed
now
,
with
his
usual
distinctness
and
fervour
.
  
<EOS>
When
all
was
concluded
,
I
said
,
"
Now
,
my
dearest
ladies
,
excuse
me
for
the
sake
of
the
delight
I
take
in
seeing
all
my
good
folks
about
me
in
this
decent
and
obliging
manner
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
I
have
no
ostentation
in
it
,
if
I
know
my
own
heart
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
countess
and
Lady
Davers
,
delighted
to
see
such
good
behaviour
in
every
one
,
sat
a
moment
or
two
looking
upon
one
another
in
silence
;
and
then
my
Lady
Davers
took
my
hand
:
<EOS>
"
Beloved
,
deservedly
beloved
of
the
kindest
of
husbands
,
<EOS>
what
a
blessing
art
thou
to
this
family

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
to
every
family

"
said
the
countess
,
"
who
have
the
happiness
to
know
,
and
the
grace
to
follow
,
her
example
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
where
,
"
said
Lady
Davers
,
"
collectedst
thou
all
this
good
sense
,
and
fine
spirit
in
thy
devotion
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
Bible
,
"
said
I
,
"
is
the
foundation
of
all
.
"
 
<EOS>
Lady
Davers
then
turning
herself
to
Mrs.
Jervis
 
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
,
good
woman
?
"
said
she
.
<EOS>
"
Why
you
are
now
made
ample
amends
for
the
love
you
bore
to
this
dear
creature
formerly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
an
angel
,
and
not
a
woman
,
for
your
lady
,
my
good
Mrs.
Jervis
,
"
said
the
countess
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jervis
,
folding
her
uplifted
hands
together
 
"
O
my
good
lady
,
you
know
not
our
happiness

no
,
not
one
half
of
it
.
<EOS>
We
were
before
blessed
with
plenty
,
and
a
bountiful
indulgence
,
by
our
good
master
;
but
our
plenty
brought
on
wantonness
and
wranglings
:
but
now
we
have
peace
as
well
as
plenty
;
and
peace
of
mind
,
my
dear
lady
,
in
doing
all
in
our
respective
powers
,
to
shew
ourselves
thankful
creatures
to
God

and
to
the
best
of
masters
and
mistresses

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Good
soul

"
said
I
,
and
was
forced
to
put
my
handkerchief
to
my
eyes
:
"
your
heart
is
always
overflowing
thus
with
gratitude
and
praises

for
what
you
so
well
merit
from
us

Mr.
Longman

said
my
lady
,
assuming
a
sprightly
air
,
although
her
eye
twinkled
,
to
keep
within
its
lids
the
precious
water
,
that
sprang
from
a
noble
and
well
-
affected
heart
,
"
I
am
glad
to
see
you
here
,
attending
your
pious
young
lady
.
 
<EOS>
Well
might
you
love
her
,
honest
man
!
 
<EOS>
I
did
not
know
there
was
so
excellent
a
creature
in
any
rank
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Madam
,
"
said
the
other
worthy
heart
,
unable
to
speak
but
in
broken
sentences
,
"
you
do
n't
know
 
<EOS>
indeed
you
do
n't
,
<EOS>
what
a
 
<EOS>
what
a
 
hap
 
<EOS>
happy
 
family
we
are
!
 
<EOS>
Truly
,
we
are
like
unto
Alexander
's
soldiers
,
every
one
fit
to
be
a
general
;
so
well
do
we
all
know
our
duties
,
and
practise
them
too
,
let
me
say
.
 
<EOS>
Nay
,
and
please
your
ladyship
,
we
all
of
us
long
till
morning
comes
,
thus
to
attend
my
lady
;
and
after
that
is
past
,
we
long
for
evening
,
for
the
same
purpose
:
for
she
is
so
good
to
us
 
<EOS>
You
can
not
think
how
good
she
is
!
<EOS>
But
permit
your
honoured
father
's
old
servant
to
say
one
word
more
,
that
though
we
are
always
pleased
and
joyful
on
these
occasions
;
yet
we
are
in
transports
to
see
our
master
's
noble
sister
thus
favouring
us
 
with
your
ladyship
too
,
"
(
to
the
countess
)
 
"
and
approving
our
young
lady
's
conduct
and
piety
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Blessing
on
you
all
!
"
said
my
lady
.
<EOS>
"
Let
us
go
,
my
lady
;
 
let
us
go
,
sister
,
for
I
can
not
stop
any
longer
!
"
  
<EOS>
As
I
slid
by
,
following
their
ladyships
 
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
,
Mr.
Colbrand
?
"
said
I
softly
:
"
I
feared
you
were
not
well
in
the
morning
.
"
<EOS>
He
bowed
 
"
Pardon
me
,
Madam
 
<EOS>
I
was
<EOS>
leetel
indispose
,
dat
ish
true
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Now
,
my
dear
friend
,
will
you
forgive
me
all
this
self
-
praise
,
as
it
may
seem
?
 
<EOS>
Yet
when
you
know
I
give
it
you
,
and
<EOS>
my
dear
parents
,
as
so
many
instances
of
my
Lady
Davers
's
reconciliation
and
goodness
to
me
,
and
as
it
will
shew
what
a
noble
heart
she
has
at
bottom
,
when
her
pride
of
quality
and
her
passion
have
subsided
,
and
her
native
good
sense
and
excellence
taken
place
,
I
flatter
myself
,
I
may
be
the
rather
excused
;
and
especially
,
as
I
hope
to
have
your
company
and
countenance
one
day
,
in
this
my
delightful
Sunday
employment
.
  
<EOS>
I
should
have
added
,
for
I
think
a
good
clergyman
can
not
be
too
much
respected
,
that
I
repeated
my
request
to
Mr.
Adams
,
to
oblige
us
with
his
company
at
supper
;
but
he
so
very
earnestly
begged
to
be
excused
,
and
with
so
much
concern
of
countenance
,
that
I
thought
it
would
be
wrong
to
insist
upon
it
;
though
I
was
sorry
for
it
,
sure
as
I
am
that
modesty
is
always
a
sign
of
merit
.
  
<EOS>
We
returned
to
the
gentlemen
when
supper
was
ready
,
as
cheerful
and
easy
,
Lady
Davers
observed
,
as
if
we
had
not
been
present
at
so
solemn
a
service
.
"
<EOS>
And
this
,
"
said
she
,
after
they
were
gone
,
"
makes
religion
so
pleasant
and
delightful
a
thing
,
that
I
profess
I
shall
have
a
much
higher
opinion
of
those
who
make
it
a
regular
and
constant
part
of
their
employment
,
than
ever
I
had
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
,
"
said
she
,
"
I
was
once
,
I
remember
,
when
a
girl
,
at
the
house
of
a
very
devout
man
,
for
a
week
,
with
his
granddaughter
,
my
school
-
fellow
;
and
there
were
such
preachments
against
vanities
,
and
for
self
-
denials
,
that
were
we
to
have
followed
the
good
man
's
precepts
,
(
though
indeed
not
his
practice
,
for
well
did
he
love
his
belly
)
,
<EOS>
half
God
Almighty
's
creatures
and
works
would
have
been
useless
,
and
industry
would
have
been
banished
the
earth
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
,
"
added
her
ladyship
,
"
have
I
heard
the
good
man
confess
himself
guilty
of
such
sins
,
as
,
if
true
(
and
by
his
hiding
his
face
with
his
broad
-
brimmed
hat
,
it
looked
a
little
bad
against
him
)
<EOS>
,
he
ought
to
have
been
hanged
on
a
gallows
fifty
feet
high
.
"
  
<EOS>
These
reflections
,
as
I
said
,
fell
from
my
lady
,
after
the
gentlemen
were
gone
,
when
she
recounted
to
her
brother
,
the
entertainment
,
as
she
was
pleased
to
call
it
,
I
had
given
her
.
<EOS>
On
which
she
made
high
encomiums
,
as
did
the
countess
;
and
they
praised
also
the
natural
dignity
which
they
imputed
to
me
,
saying
,
I
had
taught
them
a
way
they
never
could
have
found
out
,
to
descend
to
the
company
of
servants
,
and
yet
to
secure
,
and
even
augment
,
the
respect
and
veneration
of
inferiors
at
the
same
time
.
"
<EOS>
And
,
Pamela
,
"
said
my
lady
,
"
you
are
certainly
very
right
to
pay
so
much
regard
to
the
young
clergyman
;
for
that
makes
all
he
reads
,
and
all
he
says
,
of
greater
efficacy
with
the
auditors
,
facilitates
the
work
you
have
in
view
to
bring
about
,
and
in
your
own
absence
(
for
your
monarch
may
not
always
dispense
with
you
,
perhaps
)
strengthens
his
influence
,
and
encourages
him
,
beside
.
"
  
<EOS>
MONDAY
.
  
<EOS>
I
am
to
thank
you
,
my
dear
Miss
Damford
,
for
your
kind
letter
,
approving
of
my
scribble
.
<EOS>
When
you
come
to
my
Saturday
's
and
Sunday
's
accounts
,
I
shall
try
your
patience
.
<EOS>
But
no
more
of
that
;
for
as
you
can
read
them
,
or
let
them
alone
,
I
am
the
less
concerned
,
especially
as
they
will
be
more
indulgently
received
somewhere
else
,
than
they
may
merit
;
so
that
my
labour
will
not
be
wholly
lost
.
  
<EOS>
I
congratulate
you
with
all
my
heart
on
your
dismissing
Mr.
Murray
;
I
could
not
help
shewing
your
letter
to
Mr.
B.
<EOS>
And
what
do
you
think
the
free
gentleman
said
upon
it
?
<EOS>
I
am
half
afraid
to
tell
you
:
but
do
,
<EOS>
now
you
are
so
happily
disengaged
,
get
leave
to
come
,
and
let
us
two
contrive
to
be
even
with
him
for
it
.
<EOS>
You
are
the
only
lady
in
the
world
that
I
would
join
with
against
him
.
  
<EOS>
He
said
,
that
your
characters
of
Mr.
Murray
and
Miss
Nancy
,
which
he
called
severe
(
but
I
wo
n't
call
them
so
,
without
your
leave
)
,
looked
a
little
like
petty
spite
,
and
as
if
you
were
sorry
the
gentleman
took
you
at
your
word
.
<EOS>
That
was
what
he
said
 
<EOS>
Pray
let
us
punish
him
for
it
.
<EOS>
Yet
,
he
called
you
charming
lady
,
and
said
much
in
your
praise
,
and
joined
with
me
,
that
Mr.
Murray
,
who
was
so
easy
to
part
with
you
,
could
not
possibly
deserve
you
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
Pamela
,
"
said
he
,
"
I
know
the
sex
well
enough
.
<EOS>
Miss
Polly
may
not
love
Mr.
Murray
;
yet
,
to
see
her
sister
addressed
and
complimented
,
and
preferred
to
herself
,
by
one
whom
she
so
lately
thought
she
could
choose
or
refuse
,
is
a
mortifying
thing
.
 
<EOS>
And
young
ladies
can
not
bear
to
sit
by
neglected
,
while
two
lovers
are
playing
pug
's
tricks
with
each
other
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
,
"
said
he
,
"
all
the
preparations
to
matrimony
,
the
clothes
to
be
bought
,
the
visits
to
be
paid
and
received
,
the
compliments
of
friends
,
the
busy
novelty
of
the
thing
,
the
day
to
be
fixed
,
and
all
the
little
foolish
humours
and
nonsense
attending
a
concluded
courtship
,
when
one
sister
is
to
engross
all
the
attention
and
regard
,
the
new
equipages
,
and
so
forth
;
these
are
all
subjects
of
mortification
to
the
other
,
though
she
has
no
great
value
for
the
man
perhaps
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Well
,
but
,
Sir
,
"
said
I
,
"
a
lady
of
Miss
Darnford
's
good
sense
,
and
good
taste
,
is
not
to
be
affected
by
these
parades
,
and
has
well
considered
the
matter
,
no
doubt
;
and
I
dare
say
,
rejoices
,
rather
than
repines
,
at
missing
the
gentleman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
hope
you
will
leave
the
happy
pair
(
for
they
are
so
,
if
they
think
themselves
so
)
together
,
and
Sir
Simon
to
rejoice
in
his
accomplished
son
-
in
-
law
elect
,
and
give
us
your
company
to
London
.
<EOS>
For
who
would
stay
to
be
vexed
by
that
ill
-
natured
Miss
Nancy
,
as
you
own
you
were
,
at
your
last
writing
?
 
<EOS>
But
I
will
proceed
,
and
the
rather
,
as
I
have
something
to
tell
you
of
a
conversation
,
the
result
of
which
has
done
me
great
honour
,
and
given
inexpressible
delight
;
of
which
in
its
place
.
  
<EOS>
We
pursued
Mr.
B.
's
proposal
,
returning
several
visits
in
one
day
;
for
we
have
so
polite
and
agreeable
a
neighbourhood
,
that
all
seem
desirous
to
accommodate
each
other
.
  
<EOS>
We
came
not
home
till
ten
in
the
evening
,
and
then
found
a
letter
from
Sir
Jacob
Swynford
,
uncle
by
the
half
blood
to
Mr.
B.
,
acquainting
him
,
that
hearing
his
niece
,
Lady
Davers
,
was
with
him
,
he
would
be
here
in
a
day
or
two
(
being
then
upon
his
journey
)
to
pay
a
visit
to
both
at
the
same
time
.
<EOS>
This
gentleman
is
very
particularly
odd
and
humoursome
:
and
his
eldest
son
being
next
heir
to
the
maternal
estate
,
if
Mr.
B.
should
have
no
children
,
was
exceedingly
dissatisfied
with
his
debasing
himself
in
marrying
me
;
and
would
have
been
better
pleased
had
he
not
married
at
all
,
perhaps
.
  
<EOS>
There
never
was
any
cordial
love
between
Mr.
B.
's
father
and
him
,
nor
between
the
uncle
,
and
nephew
and
niece
:
for
his
positiveness
,
roughness
,
and
self
-
interestedness
too
,
has
made
him
,
though
very
rich
,
but
little
agreeable
to
the
generous
tempers
of
his
nephew
and
niece
;
yet
when
they
meet
,
which
is
not
above
once
in
four
or
five
years
,
they
are
very
civil
and
obliging
to
him
.
<EOS>
Lady
Davers
wondered
what
could
bring
him
hither
now
:
for
he
lives
in
Herefordshire
,
and
seldom
stirs
ten
miles
from
home
.
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
said
,
he
was
sure
it
was
not
to
compliment
him
and
me
on
our
nuptials
.
"
<EOS>
No
,
rather
,
"
said
my
lady
,
"
to
satisfy
himself
if
you
are
in
a
way
to
cut
out
his
own
cubs
.
<EOS>
"
 
"
Thank
God
,
we
are
,
"
said
he
.
<EOS>
"
Whenever
I
was
strongest
set
against
matrimony
,
the
only
reason
I
had
to
weigh
against
my
dislike
to
it
was
,
that
I
was
unwilling
to
leave
so
large
a
part
of
my
estate
to
that
family
.
<EOS>
My
dear
,
"
said
he
to
me
,
"
do
n't
be
uneasy
;
but
you
'll
see
a
relation
of
mine
much
more
disagreeable
than
you
can
imagine
;
but
no
doubt
you
have
heard
his
character
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
Pamela
,
"
said
Lady
Davers
,
"
we
are
a
family
that
value
ourselves
upon
our
ancestry
;
but
,
upon
my
word
,
Sir
Jacob
,
and
all
his
line
,
have
nothing
else
to
boast
of
.
<EOS>
And
I
have
been
often
ashamed
of
my
relation
to
them
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
family
,
I
believe
,
my
lady
,
has
every
body
excellent
in
it
,
"
replied
I
:
"
<EOS>
but
I
doubt
I
shall
stand
but
poorly
with
Sir
Jacob
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
wo
n't
dare
to
affront
you
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Mr.
B.
,
"
although
he
'll
say
to
you
,
and
to
me
,
and
to
my
sister
too
,
blunt
and
rough
things
.
<EOS>
But
he
'll
not
stay
above
a
day
or
two
,
and
we
shall
not
see
him
again
for
some
years
to
come
;
so
we
'll
bear
with
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
am
now
,
Miss
,
coming
to
the
conversation
I
hinted
at
.
  
<EOS>
TUESDAY
.
  
<EOS>
On
Tuesday
,
Mr.
Williams
came
to
pay
his
respects
to
his
kind
patron
.
<EOS>
I
had
been
to
visit
a
widow
gentlewoman
,
and
,
on
my
return
,
went
directly
to
my
closet
,
so
knew
not
of
his
being
here
till
I
came
to
dinner
;
for
Mr.
B.
and
he
were
near
two
hours
in
discourse
in
the
library
.
<EOS>
When
I
came
down
,
Mr.
B.
presented
him
to
me
.
"
<EOS>
My
friend
Mr.
Williams
,
my
dear
,
"
said
he
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Williams
,
how
do
you
do
?
"
said
I
;
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
to
see
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
rejoiced
,
he
said
,
to
see
me
look
so
well
;
and
had
longed
for
an
opportunity
to
pay
his
respects
to
his
worthy
patron
and
me
before
:
but
had
been
prevented
twice
when
upon
the
point
of
setting
out
.
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
said
,
"
I
have
prevailed
upon
my
old
acquaintance
to
reside
with
us
,
while
he
stays
in
these
parts
.
<EOS>
Do
you
,
my
dear
,
see
that
every
thing
is
made
agreeable
to
him
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
To
be
sure
,
Sir
,
I
will
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Adams
being
in
the
house
,
Mr.
B.
sent
to
desire
he
would
dine
with
us
:
if
it
were
but
in
respect
to
a
gentleman
of
the
same
cloth
,
who
gave
us
his
company
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
,
when
dinner
was
over
,
and
the
servants
were
withdrawn
,
said
,
"
My
dear
,
Mr.
Williams
's
business
,
in
part
,
was
to
ask
my
advice
as
to
a
living
that
is
offered
him
by
the
Earl
of
#
#
#
#
,
 
who
is
greatly
taken
with
his
preaching
and
conversation
.
"
<EOS>
"
And
to
quit
yours
,
I
presume
,
Sir
,
"
said
Lord
Davers
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
the
earl
's
is
not
quite
so
good
as
mine
,
and
his
lordship
would
procure
him
a
dispensation
to
hold
both
.
<EOS>
What
would
you
advise
,
my
dear
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
becomes
not
me
,
Sir
,
to
meddle
with
such
matters
as
these
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
my
dear
,
it
does
,
when
I
ask
your
opinion
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
beg
pardon
,
Sir
.
 
<EOS>
My
opinion
then
is
,
that
Mr.
Williams
will
not
care
to
do
any
thing
that
requires
a
dispensation
,
and
which
would
be
unlawful
without
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Madam
,
"
said
Mr.
Williams
,
"
you
speak
exceedingly
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
,
Mr.
Williams
,
that
you
approve
of
my
sentiments
,
required
of
me
by
one
who
has
a
right
to
command
me
in
every
thing
:
otherwise
this
matter
is
above
my
sphere
;
and
I
have
so
much
good
will
to
Mr.
Williams
,
that
I
wish
him
every
thing
that
will
contribute
to
make
him
happy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Mr.
B.
,
"
but
what
would
you
advise
in
this
case
?
<EOS>
The
earl
proposes
,
that
Mr.
Williams
's
present
living
be
supplied
by
a
curate
;
to
whom
,
no
doubt
,
Mr.
Williams
will
be
very
genteel
;
and
,
as
we
are
seldom
or
never
there
,
his
lordship
thinks
we
shall
not
be
displeased
with
it
,
and
insists
upon
proposing
it
to
me
;
as
he
has
done
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lord
Davers
said
,
"
I
think
this
may
do
very
well
,
brother
.
<EOS>
But
what
,
pray
,
Mr.
Williams
,
do
you
propose
to
allow
to
your
curate
?
<EOS>
Excuse
me
,
Sir
,
but
I
think
the
clergy
do
so
hardly
by
one
another
generally
,
that
they
are
not
to
be
surprised
that
some
of
the
laity
treat
them
as
they
do
.
"
  
<EOS>
Said
Mr.
B.
,
"
Tell
us
freely
,
Pamela
,
what
you
would
advise
your
friend
Mr.
Williams
to
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
must
I
,
Sir
,
speak
my
mind
on
such
a
point
,
before
so
many
better
judges
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sister
,
"
said
her
ladyship
(
a
name
she
is
now
pleased
to
give
me
freely
before
strangers
,
after
her
dear
brother
's
example
,
who
is
kindest
,
though
always
kind
,
at
such
times
)
<EOS>
"
you
must
;
if
I
may
be
allowed
to
say
must
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Why
then
,
"
proceeded
I
,
"
I
beg
leave
to
ask
Mr.
Williams
one
question
;
that
is
,
whether
his
present
parishioners
do
not
respect
and
esteem
him
in
that
particular
manner
,
which
I
think
every
body
must
,
who
knows
his
worth
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
happy
.
<EOS>
Madam
,
in
the
good
-
will
of
all
my
parishioners
,
and
have
great
acknowledgments
to
make
for
their
civilities
to
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
doubt
,
"
said
I
,
"
but
it
will
be
the
same
wherever
you
go
;
for
bad
as
the
world
is
,
a
prudent
and
good
clergyman
will
never
fail
of
respect
.
<EOS>
But
,
Sir
,
if
you
think
your
ministry
among
them
is
attended
with
good
effects
;
if
they
esteem
your
person
with
a
preference
,
and
listen
to
your
doctrines
with
attention
;
methinks
,
for
their
sakes
,
'
tis
pity
to
leave
them
,
were
the
living
of
less
value
,
as
it
is
of
more
,
than
the
other
.
<EOS>
For
,
how
many
people
are
there
who
can
benefit
by
one
gentleman
's
preaching
,
rather
than
by
another
's
;
although
,
possibly
,
the
one
's
abilities
may
be
no
way
inferior
to
the
other
's
?
<EOS>
There
is
much
in
a
delivery
,
as
it
is
called
,
in
a
manner
,
a
deportment
,
to
engage
people
's
attention
and
liking
;
and
as
you
are
already
in
possession
of
their
esteem
,
you
are
sure
to
do
much
of
the
good
you
aim
and
wish
to
do
.
<EOS>
For
where
the
flock
loves
the
shepherd
,
all
the
work
is
easy
,
and
more
than
half
done
;
and
without
that
,
let
him
have
the
tongue
of
an
angel
,
and
let
him
live
the
life
of
a
saint
,
he
will
be
heard
with
indifference
,
and
,
oftentimes
,
as
his
subject
may
be
,
with
disgust
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
paused
here
;
but
every
one
being
silent
 
"
<EOS>
As
to
the
earl
's
friendship
,
Sir
,
"
continued
I
,
"
you
can
best
judge
what
force
that
ought
to
have
upon
you
;
and
what
I
have
mentioned
would
be
the
only
difficulty
with
me
,
were
I
in
Mr.
Williams
's
case
.
<EOS>
To
be
sure
,
it
will
be
a
high
compliment
to
his
lordship
,
and
so
he
ought
to
think
it
,
that
you
quit
a
better
living
to
oblige
him
.
<EOS>
And
he
will
be
bound
in
honour
to
make
it
up
to
you
.
<EOS>
For
I
am
far
from
thinking
that
a
prudent
regard
to
worldly
interest
misbecomes
the
character
of
a
good
clergyman
;
and
I
wish
all
such
were
set
above
the
world
,
for
their
own
sakes
,
as
well
as
for
the
sakes
of
their
hearers
;
since
independency
gives
a
man
respect
,
besides
the
power
of
doing
good
,
which
will
enhance
that
respect
,
and
of
consequence
,
give
greater
efficacy
to
his
doctrines
.
  
<EOS>
"
As
to
strengthening
of
a
good
man
's
influence
,
a
point
always
to
be
wished
,
I
would
not
say
so
much
as
I
have
done
,
if
I
had
not
heard
Mr.
Longman
say
,
and
I
heard
it
with
great
pleasure
,
that
the
benefice
Mr.
Williams
so
worthily
enjoys
is
a
clear
two
hundred
pounds
a
year
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
after
all
,
does
happiness
to
a
gentleman
,
a
scholar
,
a
philosopher
,
rest
in
a
greater
or
lesser
income
?
<EOS>
On
the
contrary
,
is
it
not
oftener
to
be
found
in
a
happy
competency
or
mediocrity
?
<EOS>
Suppose
my
dear
Mr.
B.
had
five
thousand
pounds
a
year
added
to
his
present
large
income
,
would
that
increase
his
happiness
?
<EOS>
That
it
would
add
to
his
cares
,
is
no
question
;
but
could
it
give
him
one
single
comfort
which
he
has
not
already
?
<EOS>
And
if
the
dear
gentleman
had
two
or
three
thousand
less
,
might
he
be
less
happy
on
that
account
?
<EOS>
No
,
surely
;
for
it
would
render
a
greater
prudence
on
my
humble
part
necessary
,
and
a
nearer
inspection
,
and
greater
frugality
,
on
his
own
;
and
he
must
be
contented
(
if
he
did
not
,
as
now
,
perhaps
,
lay
up
every
year
)
<EOS>
so
long
as
he
lived
within
his
income
.
 
<EOS>
And
who
will
say
,
that
the
obligation
to
greater
prudence
and
economy
is
a
misfortune
?
  
<EOS>
"
The
competency
,
therefore
,
the
golden
mean
,
is
the
thing
;
and
I
have
often
considered
the
matter
,
and
endeavoured
to
square
my
actions
by
the
result
of
that
consideration
.
<EOS>
For
a
person
who
,
being
not
born
to
an
estate
,
is
not
satisfied
with
a
competency
,
will
probably
know
no
limits
to
his
desires
.
<EOS>
One
whom
an
acquisition
of
one
or
two
hundred
pounds
a
year
will
not
satisfy
,
will
hardly
sit
down
contented
with
any
sum
.
<EOS>
For
although
he
may
propose
to
himself
at
a
distance
,
that
such
and
such
an
acquisition
will
be
the
height
of
his
ambition
;
yet
he
will
,
as
he
approaches
to
that
,
advance
upon
himself
farther
and
farther
,
and
know
no
bound
,
till
the
natural
one
is
forced
upon
him
,
and
his
life
and
his
views
end
together
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
let
me
humbly
beg
pardon
of
you
all
,
ladies
and
gentlemen
,
"
turning
my
eyes
to
each
;
"
but
most
of
you
,
my
good
lady
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
,
Madam
,
"
said
Mr.
Williams
,
"
after
what
I
have
heard
from
you
,
I
would
not
,
for
the
world
,
have
been
of
another
mind
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
a
good
man

"
said
I
;
"
and
I
have
such
an
opinion
of
your
worthiness
,
and
the
credit
you
do
your
function
,
that
I
can
never
suspect
either
your
judgment
or
your
conduct
.
<EOS>
But
pray
,
Sir
,
may
I
ask
,
what
have
you
determined
to
do
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
Madam
,
"
replied
he
,
"
<EOS>
I
am
staggered
in
that
too
,
by
the
observation
you
just
now
made
,
that
where
a
man
has
the
love
of
his
parishioners
,
he
ought
not
to
think
of
leaving
them
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Else
,
Sir
,
I
find
you
was
rather
inclined
to
oblige
the
earl
,
though
the
living
be
of
less
value
!
<EOS>
This
is
very
noble
,
Sir
;
it
is
more
than
generous
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
"
said
Mr.
B.
,
"
I
'll
tell
you
(
for
Mr.
Williams
's
modesty
will
not
let
him
speak
it
before
all
the
company
)
<EOS>
what
is
his
motive
;
and
a
worthy
one
you
'll
say
it
is
.
<EOS>
Excuse
me
,
Mr.
Williams
;
"
 
for
the
reverend
gentleman
blushed
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
earl
has
of
late
years
 
we
all
know
his
character
 
given
himself
up
to
carousing
,
and
he
will
suffer
no
man
to
go
from
his
table
sober
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Williams
has
taken
the
liberty
to
expostulate
,
as
became
his
function
,
with
his
lordship
on
this
subject
,
and
upon
some
other
irregularities
,
so
agreeably
,
that
the
earl
has
taken
a
great
liking
to
him
,
and
promises
,
that
he
will
suffer
his
reasonings
to
have
an
effect
upon
him
,
and
that
he
shall
reform
his
whole
household
,
if
he
will
come
and
live
near
him
,
and
regulate
his
table
by
his
own
example
.
<EOS>
The
countess
is
a
very
good
lady
,
and
privately
presses
Mr.
Williams
to
oblige
the
earl
:
and
this
is
our
worthy
friend
's
main
inducement
;
with
the
hope
,
which
I
should
mention
,
that
he
has
,
of
preserving
untainted
the
morals
of
the
two
young
gentlemen
,
the
earl
's
son
,
who
,
he
fears
,
will
be
carried
away
by
the
force
of
such
an
example
:
and
he
thinks
,
as
the
earl
's
living
has
fallen
,
mine
may
be
better
supplied
than
the
earl
's
,
if
he
,
as
he
kindly
offers
,
gives
it
me
back
again
;
<EOS>
otherwise
the
earl
,
as
he
apprehends
,
will
find
out
for
his
,
some
gentleman
,
if
such
an
one
can
be
found
,
as
will
rather
further
,
than
obstruct
his
own
irregularities

as
was
the
unhappy
case
of
the
last
incumbent

this

I
said

is
a
point
of
conscience

I
made
it
so

I
presented

To

is

on

I

added

If
it
was
five
hundred
pounds
,
and
would
make
you
happier
(
for
that
,
Sir

is
the
thing
)
I
should
wish
it
you
,
"
said
I
,
"
and
think
it
short
of
your
merits
.
<EOS>
But
pray
,
Sir
,
what
is
the
earl
's
living
valued
at
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
At
about
two
hundred
and
twenty
pounds
,
Madam
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
then
,
"
replied
I
,
very
pertly
,
"
<EOS>
I
believe
now
I
have
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Williams
,
for
motives
most
excellently
worthy
of
his
function
,
inclines
to
surrender
up
to
Mr.
B.
his
living
of
three
hundred
pounds
per
annum
,
and
to
accept
of
the
earl
's
living
of
two
hundred
and
twenty
.
<EOS>
Dear
Sir
,
I
am
going
to
be
very
bold
;
but
under
your
condition
nevertheless
:
 
let
the
gentleman
,
to
whom
you
shall
present
the
living
of
E.
allow
eighty
pounds
per
annum
out
of
it
to
Mr.
Williams
,
till
the
earl
's
favour
shall
make
up
the
difference
to
him
,
and
no
longer
.
<EOS>
And
 
but
I
dare
not
name
the
gentleman
:
 
for
how
,
dear
Sir
,
were
I
to
be
so
bold
,
shall
I
part
with
my
chaplain
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Admirable
!
<EOS>
most
admirable
!
"
said
Lord
and
Lady
Davers
,
in
the
same
words
.
<EOS>
The
countess
praised
the
decision
too
;
and
Mr.
H.
with
his
"
Let
me
be
hang'd
,
"
and
his
"
Fore
Gad
's
,
"
and
such
exclamations
natural
to
him
,
made
his
plaudits
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Williams
said
,
he
could
wish
with
all
his
heart
it
might
be
so
;
and
Mr.
Adams
was
so
abashed
and
surprised
,
that
he
could
not
hold
up
his
head
;
 
but
joy
danced
in
his
silent
countenance
,
for
all
that
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
having
hesitated
a
few
minutes
.
<EOS>
Lady
Davers
called
out
for
his
objection
,
or
consent
,
according
to
condition
,
and
he
said
,
"
I
can
not
so
soon
determine
as
that
prompt
slut
did
.
<EOS>
I
'll
withdraw
one
minute
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
did
so
,
as
I
found
afterwards
to
advise
,
like
the
considerate
and
genteel
spirit
he
possesses
,
with
Mr.
Williams
,
whom
he
beckoned
out
,
and
to
examine
whether
he
was
in
earnest
willing
to
give
it
up
,
or
very
desirous
for
any
one
to
succeed
him
;
saying
,
that
if
he
had
,
he
thought
himself
obliged
,
in
return
for
his
worthy
behaviour
to
him
,
to
pay
a
particular
regard
to
his
recommendation
.
<EOS>
And
so
being
answered
as
he
desired
,
in
they
came
together
again
.
  
<EOS>
But
I
should
say
,
that
his
withdrawing
with
a
very
serious
aspect
,
made
me
afraid
I
had
gone
too
far
:
and
I
said
,
"
What
shall
I
do
,
if
I
have
incurred
Mr.
B.
's
anger
by
my
over
-
forwardness
!
<EOS>
Did
he
not
look
displeased
?
<EOS>
Dear
ladies
,
if
he
be
so
,
plead
for
me
,
and
I
'll
withdraw
when
he
comes
in
;
for
I
can
not
stand
his
anger
:
I
have
not
been
used
to
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Never
fear
,
Pamela
,
"
said
my
lady
;
"
he
ca
n't
be
angry
at
any
thing
you
say
or
do
.
<EOS>
But
I
wish
,
for
the
sake
of
what
I
have
witnessed
of
Mr.
Adams
's
behaviour
and
modesty
,
that
such
a
thing
could
be
done
for
him
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Adams
bowed
,
and
said
,
"
O
my
good
ladies
!
'
<EOS>
tis
too
considerable
a
thing
<EOS>
:
I
can
not
expect
it
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
 
<EOS>
it
would
be
presumption
if
I
did
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Just
then
re
-
entered
Mr.
B.
and
Mr.
Williams
:
the
first
with
a
stately
air
,
the
other
with
a
more
peace
-
portending
smile
on
his
countenance
.
  
<EOS>
But
Mr.
B.
sitting
down
,
"
Well
,
Pamela
,
"
said
he
,
very
gravely
,
"
I
see
that
power
is
a
dangerous
thing
in
any
hand
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
Sir
!
"
said
I
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
lady
,
"
whispering
to
Lady
Davers
,
"
I
will
withdraw
,
as
I
said
I
would
.
"
<EOS>
And
I
was
getting
away
as
fast
as
I
could
:
but
he
arose
and
took
my
hand
,
"
<EOS>
Why
is
my
charmer
so
soon
frightened
?
"
said
he
,
most
kindly
;
and
still
more
kindly
,
with
a
noble
air
,
pressed
it
to
his
lips
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
not
carry
my
jest
too
far
upon
a
mind
so
apprehensive
,
as
I
otherwise
might
be
inclined
to
do
.
"
<EOS>
And
leading
me
to
Mr.
Adams
and
Mr.
Williams
,
he
said
,
taking
Mr.
Williams
's
hand
with
his
left
,
as
he
held
mine
in
his
right
,
"
Your
worthy
brother
clergyman
,
Mr.
Adams
,
gives
me
leave
to
confirm
the
decision
of
my
dear
wife
,
whom
you
are
to
thank
for
the
living
of
E.
upon
the
condition
she
proposed
;
and
may
you
give
but
as
much
satisfaction
there
,
as
you
have
done
in
this
family
,
and
as
Mr.
Williams
has
given
to
his
flock
;
and
they
will
then
be
pleased
as
much
with
your
ministry
as
they
have
hitherto
been
with
his
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Adams
trembled
with
joy
,
and
said
,
he
could
not
tell
how
to
bear
this
excess
of
goodness
in
us
both
:
and
his
countenance
and
eyes
gave
testimony
of
a
gratitude
too
high
for
further
expression
.
  
<EOS>
As
for
myself
,
you
,
my
honoured
and
dear
friends
,
who
know
how
much
I
am
always
raised
,
when
I
am
made
the
dispenser
of
acts
of
bounty
and
generosity
to
the
deserving
;
and
who
now
instead
of
incurring
blame
,
as
I
had
apprehended
,
found
myself
applauded
by
every
one
,
and
most
by
the
gentleman
whose
approbation
I
chiefly
coveted
to
have
:
you
,
I
say
,
will
judge
how
greatly
I
must
be
delighted
.
  
<EOS>
But
I
was
still
more
affected
,
when
Mr.
B.
directing
himself
to
me
,
and
to
Mr.
Williams
at
the
same
time
,
was
pleased
to
say
,
"
Here
,
my
dear
,
you
must
thank
this
good
gentleman
for
enabling
you
to
give
such
a
shining
proof
of
your
excellence
:
and
whenever
I
put
power
into
your
hands
for
the
future
,
act
<EOS>
but
as
you
have
now
done
,
and
it
will
be
impossible
that
I
should
have
any
choice
or
will
<EOS>
but
yours
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
O
Sir
,
"
said
I
,
pressing
his
hand
with
my
lips
,
forgetting
how
many
witnesses
I
had
of
my
grateful
fondness
,
"
how
shall
I
,
oppressed
with
your
goodness
,
in
such
a
signal
instance
as
this
,
find
words
equal
to
the
gratitude
of
my
heart
!
 
<EOS>
But
here
,
"
patting
my
bosom
,
"
just
here
,
they
stick
;
 
and
I
can
not
"
  
<EOS>
And
,
indeed
,
I
could
say
no
more
;
and
Mr.
B.
in
the
delicacy
of
his
apprehensiveness
for
me
,
led
me
into
the
next
parlour
;
and
placing
himself
by
me
on
the
settee
,
said
,
"
Take
care
,
my
best
beloved
,
that
the
joy
,
which
overflows
your
dear
heart
,
for
having
done
a
beneficent
action
to
a
deserving
gentleman
,
does
not
affect
you
too
much
.
"
  
<EOS>
My
Lady
Davers
followed
us
:
"
Where
is
my
angelic
sister
?
"
said
she
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
a
share
in
her
next
to
yourself
,
my
noble
brother
.
"
<EOS>
And
clasping
me
to
her
generous
bosom
,
she
ran
over
with
expressions
of
favour
to
me
,
in
a
style
and
words
,
which
would
suffer
,
were
I
to
endeavour
to
repeat
them
.
  
<EOS>
Coffee
being
ready
,
we
returned
to
the
company
.
<EOS>
My
Lord
Davers
was
pleased
to
make
me
a
great
many
compliments
,
and
so
did
Mr.
H.
after
his
manner
.
<EOS>
But
the
countess
exceeded
herself
in
goodness
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
was
pleased
to
say
,
"
It
is
a
rule
with
me
,
not
to
leave
till
to
-
morrow
what
can
be
done
to
-
day
:
 
and
when
,
my
dear
,
do
you
propose
to
dispense
with
Mr.
Adams
's
good
offices
in
your
family
?
<EOS>
Or
did
you
intend
to
induce
him
to
go
to
town
with
us
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
had
not
proposed
anything
,
Sir
,
as
to
that
,
for
I
had
not
asked
your
kind
direction
:
but
the
good
dean
will
supply
us
,
<EOS>
I
doubt
not
,
and
when
we
set
out
for
London
,
Mr.
Adams
will
be
at
full
liberty
,
with
his
worthy
friend
,
Mr.
Williams
,
to
pursue
the
happy
scheme
your
goodness
has
permitted
to
take
effect
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Mr.
Adams
,
my
dear
,
who
came
so
lately
from
the
university
,
can
,
perhaps
,
recommend
such
another
young
gentleman
as
himself
,
to
perform
the
functions
he
used
to
perform
in
your
family
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
looked
<EOS>
,
it
seems
,
a
little
grave
;
and
Mr.
B.
said
,
"
What
have
you
to
offer
,
Pamela
?
 
<EOS>
What
have
I
said
amiss
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Amiss
!
<EOS>
dear
Sir
!
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
Ay
,
and
dear
Madam
too
!
<EOS>
I
see
by
your
bashful
seriousness
,
in
place
of
that
smiling
approbation
which
you
always
shew
when
I
utter
any
thing
you
entirely
approve
,
that
I
have
said
something
which
would
rather
meet
with
your
acquiescence
,
than
choice
.
<EOS>
So
,
as
I
have
often
told
you
,
none
of
your
reserves
;
and
never
hesitate
to
me
your
consent
in
any
thing
,
while
you
are
sure
I
will
conform
to
your
wishes
,
or
pursue
my
own
liking
,
as
either
shall
appear
reasonable
to
me
,
when
I
have
heard
your
reasons
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
then
,
dear
Sir
,
what
I
had
presumed
to
think
,
but
I
submit
it
to
your
better
judgment
,
was
,
whether
,
since
the
gentleman
who
is
so
kind
as
to
assist
us
in
our
family
devotions
,
in
some
measure
acts
in
the
province
of
the
worthy
dean
,
it
were
not
right
,
that
our
own
parish
-
minister
,
whether
here
or
in
London
,
should
name
,
or
at
least
approve
our
naming
,
the
gentleman
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
could
not
I
have
thought
of
that
,
as
well
as
you
,
sauce
-
box
?
 
<EOS>
Lady
Davers
,
I
am
entirely
on
your
side
:
I
think
she
deserves
a
slap
now
from
us
both
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
forgive
her
,
"
said
my
lady
,
"
since
I
find
her
sentiments
and
actions
as
much
a
reproof
to
others
as
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Williams
,
did
you
ever
think
,
"
said
Mr.
B.
,
"
it
would
have
come
to
this
?
 
<EOS>
Did
you
ever
know
such
a
saucy
girl
in
your
life
?
 
<EOS>
Already
to
give
herself
these
reproaching
airs
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
never
,
if
your
honour
is
pleased
to
call
the
most
excellent
lady
in
the
world
by
such
a
name
,
nor
any
body
else

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Pamela
,
I
charge
you

said
the
dear
gentleman

"
if
you
study
for
it

be
sometimes
in
the
wrong

that
one
may
not
always
be
taking
lessons
from
such
an
assurance

in
our
turns

have
something
to
teach
you

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
,
dear
Sir
,
"
said
I
,
"
must
I
not
be
a
strange
creature
?
<EOS>
For
how
,
when
you
,
and
my
good
ladies
,
are
continually
giving
me
such
charming
examples
,
can
I
do
a
wrong
thing
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
hope
you
will
forgive
me
,
my
dear
,
for
being
so
tedious
on
the
foregoing
subject
,
and
its
most
agreeable
conclusion
.
<EOS>
It
is
an
important
one
,
because
several
persons
,
as
conferers
or
receivers
,
have
found
their
pleasure
and
account
in
it
;
and
it
would
be
well
,
if
conversation
were
often
attended
with
like
happy
consequences
.
<EOS>
I
have
one
merit
to
plead
in
behalf
even
of
my
prolixity
;
that
in
reciting
the
delightful
conferences
I
have
the
pleasure
of
holding
with
our
noble
guests
and
Mr.
B.
<EOS>
,
I
am
careful
not
to
write
twice
upon
one
topic
,
although
several
which
I
omit
,
may
be
more
worthy
of
your
notice
than
those
I
give
;
so
that
you
have
as
much
variety
from
me
,
as
the
nature
of
the
facts
and
cases
will
admit
of
.
  
<EOS>
But
here
I
will
conclude
,
having
a
very
different
subject
,
as
a
proof
of
what
I
have
advanced
,
to
touch
in
my
next
.
<EOS>
Till
when
,
I
am
your
most
affectionate
and
faithful
,
  
P.B.
    
<EOS>
My
dear
Miss
Darnford
,
  
<EOS>
I
now
proceed
with
my
journal
,
which
I
brought
down
to
Tuesday
evening
;
and
of
course
I
begin
with
  
WEDNESDAY
.
  
<EOS>
Towards
evening
came
Sir
Jacob
Swynford
,
on
horseback
,
attended
by
two
servants
in
liveries
.
<EOS>
I
was
abroad
;
for
I
had
got
leave
for
a
whole
afternoon
,
attended
by
my
Polly
;
which
time
I
passed
in
visiting
no
less
than
four
poor
sick
families
,
whose
hearts
I
made
glad
.
<EOS>
But
I
should
be
too
tedious
,
were
I
to
give
you
the
particulars
;
besides
,
I
have
a
brief
list
of
cases
,
which
,
when
you
'll
favour
me
with
your
company
,
I
may
shew
you
:
for
I
oblige
myself
,
though
not
desired
,
to
keep
an
account
of
what
I
do
with
no
less
than
two
hundred
pounds
a
year
,
that
Mr.
B.
allows
me
to
expend
in
acts
of
charity
and
benevolence
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Davers
told
me
afterwards
,
that
Sir
Jacob
carried
it
mighty
stiff
and
formal
when
he
alighted
.
<EOS>
He
strutted
about
the
court
-
yard
in
his
boots
,
with
his
whip
in
his
hand
;
and
though
her
ladyship
went
to
the
great
door
,
in
order
to
welcome
him
,
he
turned
short
,
and
,
whistling
,
followed
the
groom
into
the
stable
,
as
if
he
had
been
at
an
inn
,
only
,
instead
of
taking
off
his
hat
,
pulling
its
broad
brim
over
his
eyes
,
for
a
compliment
.
<EOS>
In
she
went
in
a
pet
,
as
she
says
,
saying
to
the
countess
,
"
A
surly
brute
he
always
was
!
<EOS>
My
uncle
!
<EOS>
He
's
more
of
an
ostler
than
a
gentleman
;
I
'm
resolved
I
'll
not
stir
to
meet
him
again
.
<EOS>
And
yet
the
wretch
loves
respect
from
others
,
though
he
never
practises
common
civility
himself
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
countess
said
,
she
was
glad
he
was
come
,
for
she
loved
to
divert
herself
with
such
odd
characters
now
-
and
-
then
.
  
<EOS>
And
now
let
me
give
you
a
short
description
of
him
as
I
found
him
,
when
I
came
in
,
that
you
may
the
better
conceive
what
sort
of
a
gentleman
he
is
.
  
<EOS>
He
is
about
sixty
-
five
years
of
age
,
a
coarse
,
strong
,
big
-
boned
man
,
with
large
irregular
features
;
he
has
a
haughty
supercilious
look
,
a
swaggering
gait
,
and
a
person
not
at
all
bespeaking
one
's
favour
in
behalf
of
his
mind
;
and
his
mind
,
as
you
shall
hear
by
and
bye
,
not
clearing
up
those
prepossessions
in
his
disfavour
,
with
which
his
person
and
features
at
first
strike
one
.
<EOS>
His
voice
is
big
and
surly
;
his
eyes
little
and
fiery
;
his
mouth
large
,
with
yellow
and
blackish
teeth
,
what
are
left
of
them
being
broken
off
to
a
tolerable
regular
height
,
looked
as
if
they
were
ground
down
to
his
gums
,
by
constant
use
.
<EOS>
But
with
all
these
imperfections
,
he
has
an
air
that
sets
him
somewhat
above
the
mere
vulgar
,
and
makes
one
think
half
his
disadvantages
rather
owing
to
his
own
haughty
humour
,
than
to
nature
;
for
he
seems
to
be
a
perfect
tyrant
at
first
sight
,
a
man
used
to
prescribe
,
and
not
to
be
prescribed
to
;
and
has
the
advantage
of
a
shrewd
penetrating
look
,
but
which
seems
rather
acquired
than
natural
.
  
<EOS>
After
he
had
seen
his
horses
well
served
,
and
put
on
an
old
-
fashioned
gold
-
buttoned
coat
,
which
by
its
freshness
shewed
he
had
been
very
chary
of
it
,
a
better
wig
,
but
in
stiff
buckle
,
and
a
long
sword
,
stuck
stiffly
,
as
if
through
his
coat
lappets
,
in
he
came
,
and
with
an
imperious
air
entering
the
parlour
,
"
What
,
nobody
come
to
meet
me
!
"
<EOS>
said
he
;
and
saluting
her
ladyship
.
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
do
,
niece
?
"
and
looked
about
haughtily
,
she
says
,
as
if
he
expected
to
see
me
.
<EOS>
My
lady
presenting
the
countess
,
said
,
"
The
Countess
of
C.
,
Sir
Jacob
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Your
most
obedient
humble
servant
,
Madam

<EOS>
I
hope
his
lordship
is
well
.
<EOS>

<EOS>
"
At
your
service
,
Sir
Jacob
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
he
was

"
said
he
,
bluntly
;
"
he
should
not
have
voted
as
he
did
last
sessions
,
I
can
tell
you
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
Sir
Jacob
,
"
said
she
,
"
servants
,
in
this
free
kingdom
,
do
n't
always
do
as
their
masters
would
have

em

<EOS>

Mine
do

I

"

Right
or
wrong
,
Sir
Jacob
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
ca
n't
be
wrong
if
I
command
them
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
truly
,
Sir
Jacob
,
there
's
many
a
private
gentleman
carries
it
higher
to
a
servant
,
than
he
cares
his
prince
should
to
him
;
but
I
thought
,
till
now
,
it
was
the
king
only
that
could
do
no
wrong
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
always
take
care
to
be
right
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
A
good
reason
 
<EOS>
because
,
I
dare
say
,
you
never
think
you
can
be
in
the
wrong
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Your
ladyship
should
spare
me
:
<EOS>
I
'm
but
just
come
off
a
journey
.
<EOS>
Let
me
turn
myself
about
,
and
I
'll
be
up
with
you
,
never
fear
.
<EOS>
Madam
.
 
<EOS>
But
where
's
my
nephew
,
Lady
Davers
?
<EOS>
And
where
's
your
lord
?
<EOS>
I
was
told
you
were
all
here
,
and
young
H.
too
upon
a
very
extraordinary
occasion
;
so
I
was
willing
to
see
how
causes
went
among
you
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
long
enough
before
you
come
to
see
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
My
brother
,
and
Lord
Davers
,
and
Mr.
H.
have
all
rode
out
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
niece
,

strutting
with
his
hands
behind
him
,
and
his
head
held
up

Ha

<EOS>
He
has
made
a
fine
kettle

on't

han't
he

<EOS>
that
ever
such
a
rake
should
be
so
caught

<EOS>
They
tell
me
,
she
's
plaguy
cunning
,
and
quite
smart
and
handsome
.
<EOS>
But
I
wish
his
father
were
living
.
<EOS>
Yet
what
could
he
have
done
?
<EOS>
Your
brother
was
always
unmanageable
.
<EOS>
I
wish
he
'd
been
my
son
;
by
my
faith

I
do
!
<EOS>
What
!
<EOS>
I
hope

niece

he
locks
up
his
baby
,
while
you
're
here

<EOS>
You
do
n't
keep
her
company
,
do
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Sir
Jacob
,
I
do
:
<EOS>
and
you
'll
do
so
too
,
when
you
see
her

<EOS>
"
Why

thou
countenancest
him
in
his
folly

child

I

you
'll
say
presently

"
  
<EOS>
"
What

dost
think
I
shall
look
through
his
foolish
eyes
?
<EOS>
What
a
disgrace
to
a
family
ancienter
than
the
Conquest
!
<EOS>
O
Tempora
!
<EOS>
O
Mores
!
<EOS>
What
will
this
world
come
to
?
<EOS>
"
The
countess
was
diverted
with
this
odd
gentleman
,
but
ran
on
in
my
praise
,
for
fear
he
should
say
some
rude
things
to
me
when
I
came
in
;
and
Lady
Davers
seconded
her
.
<EOS>
But
all
signified
nothing
.
<EOS>
He
would
tell
us
both
his
mind
,
let
the
young
whelp
(
that
was
his
word
)
take
it
as
he
would
 
"
And
pray
,
"
said
he
,
"
<EOS>
ca
n't
I
see
this
fine
body
before
he
comes
in
?
<EOS>
Let
me
but
turn
her
round
two
or
three
times
,
and
ask
her
a
question
or
two
;
and
by
her
answer
I
shall
know
what
to
think
of
her
in
a
twinkling
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
She
is
gone
to
take
a
little
airing
,
Sir
Jacob
,
and
wo
n't
be
back
till
supper
-
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Supper
-
time
!
<EOS>
Why
,
she
is
not
to
sit
at
table
,
is
she
?
<EOS>
If
she
does
,
I
wo
n't
;
that
's
positive
.
<EOS>
But
now
you
talk
of
a
supper
,
what
have
you
?
 
<EOS>
I
must
have
a
boiled
chicken
,
and
shall
eat
it
all
myself
.
<EOS>
Who
's
housekeeper
now
?
<EOS>
I
suppose
all
's
turned
upside
down
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
there
is
not
one
new
servant
,
except
a
girl
that
waits
upon
her
own
person
:
all
the
old
ones
remain
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
much
!
<EOS>
These
creatures
generally
take
as
great
state
upon
them
as
a
born
lady
;
and
they
're
in
the
right
.
<EOS>
If
they
can
make
the
man
stoop
to
the
great
point
,
they
'll
hold
his
nose
to
the
grind
-
stone
:
and
all
the
little
ones
come
about
in
course
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Sir
Jacob
,
when
you
see
her
,
you
'll
alter
your
mind
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Never
,
never
;
that
's
positive
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
Sir
Jacob
,
I
was
as
positive
as
you
once
;
but
I
love
her
now
as
well
as
if
she
were
my
own
sister
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
O
hideous
,
hideous
!
<EOS>
All
the
fools
he
has
made
wherever
he
has
travelled
,
will
clap
their
hands
at
him
,
and
at
you
too
,
if
you
talk
at
this
rate
.
<EOS>
But
let
me
speak
to
Mrs.
Jervis
,
if
she
be
here
:
I
'll
order
my
own
supper
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
So
he
went
out
,
saying
,
he
knew
the
house
,
though
in
a
better
mistress
's
days
.
<EOS>
The
countess
said
,
if
Mr.
B.
as
she
hoped
,
kept
his
temper
,
there
would
be
good
diversion
with
the
old
gentleman
.
"
<EOS>
O
yes
,
"
said
my
lady
,
"
<EOS>
my
brother
will
,
I
dare
say
.
<EOS>
He
despises
the
surly
brute
too
much
to
be
angry
with
him
,
say
what
he
will
.
"
<EOS>
He
talked
a
great
deal
against
me
to
Mrs.
Jervis
.
<EOS>
You
may
guess
,
my
dear
,
that
she
launched
out
in
my
praises
;
and
he
was
offended
at
her
,
and
said
,
"
Woman
!
<EOS>
woman
!
<EOS>
forbear
these
ill
-
timed
praises
;
her
birth
's
a
disgrace
to
our
family
.
<EOS>
What
!
<EOS>
my
sister
's
waiting
-
maid
,
taken
upon
charity
!
<EOS>
I
can
not
bear
it
.
<EOS>
"
I
mention
all
these
things
,
as
I
afterwards
heard
them
,
because
it
shall
prepare
you
to
judge
what
a
fine
time
<EOS>
I
was
likely
to
have
of
it
.
<EOS>
When
Mr.
B.
and
my
Lord
Davers
,
and
Mr.
H.
came
home
,
which
they
did
about
half
an
hour
after
six
,
they
were
told
who
was
there
,
just
as
they
entered
the
parlour
;
and
Mr.
B.
smiled
at
Lord
Davers
,
and
entering
,
"
Sir
Jacob
,
"
said
he
,
"
welcome
to
Bedfordshire
;
and
thrice
welcome
to
this
house
;
I
rejoice
to
see
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
My
lady
says
,
never
was
so
odd
a
figure
as
the
old
baronet
made
,
when
thus
accosted
.
<EOS>
He
stood
up
indeed
;
but
as
Mr.
B.
offered
to
take
his
hand
,
he
put
'em
both
behind
him
.
"
<EOS>
Not
that
you
know
of
.
<EOS>
Sir
!
"
<EOS>
And
then
looking
up
at
his
face
,
and
down
at
his
feet
,
three
or
four
times
successively
,
"
Are
you
my
brother
's
son
?
<EOS>
That
very
individual
son
,
that
your
good
father
used
to
boast
of
,
and
say
,
that
for
handsome
person
,
true
courage
,
noble
mind
,
was
not
to
be
matched
in
any
three
counties
in
England
?

"
  
<EOS>
"
The
very
same
,
dear
Sir

that
my
honoured
father
's
partiality
used
to
think
he
never
praised
enough

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
is
all
of
it
come
to
at
last
?
 
<EOS>
He
paid
well
,
<EOS>
did
he
not
,
to
teach
you
to
know
the
world

nephew

<EOS>
hadst
thou
been
born
a
fool

raw
greenhead

doating
greyhead

<EOS>
What
then
,
Sir
Jacob
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Why
then
thou
wouldst
have
done
just
as
thou
hast
done

Come

Jacob

know
not

You

not

an
angel
I
have
in
person

mind

Your
eyes

by

bye
be
blest
with
the
sight
of
her

your
ears
with
hearing

speak

call
all
you

said

profanation

<EOS>
"
What
is
it
<EOS>
I
hear
?
<EOS>
You
talk
in
the
language
of
romance
;
and
from
the
housekeeper
to
the
head
of
the
house
,
you
're
all
stark
staring
mad
.
<EOS>
Nephew
,
I
wish

for
thy
own
credit

thou
wert
 
<EOS>
But
what
signifies
wishing
?
 
<EOS>
I
hope
you
'll
not
bring
your
syren
into
my
company

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
will
,
Sir
,
because
I
love
to
give
you
pleasure

And
say
not
a
word
more
,
for
your
own
sake
,
till
you
see
her

You
'll
have
the
less
to
unsay

the
less
to
repent
of

<EOS>

I
'm
in
an
enchanted
castle

that
's
certain

What
a
plague
has
this
little
witch
done
to
you
all

And
how
did
she
bring
it
about

"
  
<EOS>
The
ladies
and
Lord
Davers
laughed
,
it
seems
;
and
Mr.
B.
begging
him
to
sit
down
,
and
answer
him
some
family
questions
,
he
said
,
(
for
it
seems
he
is
very
captious
at
times
)

at

whistled
he

with

wild
stare

youngster

<EOS>
He
ran
to
the
window
,
and
throwing
up
the
sash
looking
into
the
court
-
yard
,
said
,
"
Hollo
 
<EOS>
So

ho

Jack
 
Jonas
 
Get
me
my

<EOS>
I
'll
keep
no

<EOS>
I
'll
be
gone

<EOS>
Why
,
Jonas
!
"
calling
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
're
not
in
earnest
,
Sir
Jacob
,
"
said
Mr.
B.
  
"
I
am
!
 
<EOS>
I
'll
away
to
the
village
this
night
!
<EOS>
Why
you
're
all
upon
the
high
game
!
<EOS>
I
'll
 
<EOS>
But
who
comes
here
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
For
just
then
,
the
chariot
brought
me
into
the
court
-
yard
 
<EOS>
"
Who
's
this
?
<EOS>
who
is
she
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
One
of
my
daughters
,
"
started
up
the
countess
;
"
my
youngest
daughter
Jenny
!
 
<EOS>
She
's
the
pride
of
my
family
,
Sir
Jacob
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
was
running
;
for
I
thought
it
was
the
grand
enchantress
.
<EOS>
"
Out
steps
Lady
Davers
to
me
;
"
Dear
Pamela
,
"
said
she
,
"
humour
all
that
's
said
to
you
.
<EOS>
Here
's
Sir
Jacob
come
.
<EOS>
You
're
the
Countess
of
C.
's
youngest
daughter
Jenny
 
<EOS>
That
's
your
cue
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
?
<EOS>
but
,
Madam
,
"
said
I
,
"
<EOS>
Lady
Jenny
is
not
married
,
"
looking
(
before
I
thought
)
on
a
circumstance
that
I
think
too
much
of
sometimes
,
though
I
carry
it
off
as
well
as
I
can
.
<EOS>
She
laughed
at
my
exception
:
"
Come
,
Lady
Jenny
,
"
said
she
,
(
for
I
just
entered
the
great
door
)
<EOS>
,
"
I
hope
you
've
had
a
fine
airing
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
A
very
pretty
one
,
Madam
,
"
said
I
,
as
I
entered
the
parlour
.
<EOS>
"
This
is
a
pleasant
country
,
Lady
Davers
.
"
<EOS>
(
"
Wink
when
I
'm
wrong
,
"
whispered
I
)
,
<EOS>
"
Where
's
Mrs.
B.
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Then
,
as
seeing
a
strange
gentleman
,
I
started
half
back
,
into
a
more
reserved
air
;
and
made
him
a
low
curt'sy
.
<EOS>
Sir
Jacob
looked
as
if
he
did
not
know
what
to
think
of
it
,
now
at
me
,
now
at
Mr.
B.
who
put
him
quite
out
of
doubt
,
by
taking
my
hand
:
"
<EOS>
Well
,
Lady
Jenny
,
did
you
meet
my
fugitive
in
your
tour
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
Mr.
B.
Did
she
go
my
way
?
<EOS>
I
told
you
I
would
keep
the
great
road
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Lady
Jenny
C.
,
"
said
Mr.
B.
,
presenting
me
to
his
uncle
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
charming
creature
!
"
<EOS>
added
he
:
"
<EOS>
Have
you
not
a
son
worthy
of
such
an
alliance
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
nephew
,
this
is
a
lady
indeed
!
<EOS>
Why
the
plague
,
"
whispered
he
,
"
could
you
not
have
pitched
your
tent
here
?
<EOS>
Miss
,
by
your
leave
,
"
and
saluting
me
,
turned
to
the
countess
.
<EOS>
"
Madam
,
you
've
a
charming
daughter
!
<EOS>
Had
my
rash
nephew
seen
this
lovely
creature
,
and
you
condescended
,
he
'd
never
have
stooped
to
the
cottage
as
he
has
done
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
're
right
,
Sir
Jacob
,
"
said
Mr.
B.
;
"
but
I
always
ran
too
fast
for
my
fortune
:
yet
these
ladies
of
family
never
bring
out
their
jewels
into
bachelors
'
company
;
and
when
,
too
late
,
we
see
what
we
've
missed
,
we
are
vexed
at
our
precipitation
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
said
,
however
,
boy
.
<EOS>
I
wish
thee
repentance
,
though
'
tis
out
of
thy
power
to
mend
.
<EOS>
Be
that
one
of
thy
curses
,
when
thou
seest
this
lady
;
as
no
doubt
it
is
.
"
<EOS>
Again
surveying
me
from
head
to
foot
,
and
turning
me
round
,
which
,
it
seems
,
is
a
mighty
practice
with
him
to
a
stranger
lady
,
(
and
a
modest
one
too
,
you
'll
say
,
Miss
)
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
truly
,
you
're
a
charming
creature
,
Miss
 
<EOS>
Lady
Jenny
<EOS>
I
would
say
 
By
your
leave
,
once
more
!
 
<EOS>
My
Lady
Countess
,
she
is
a
charmer
!
<EOS>
But
 
but
"
staring
at
me
,
"
Are
you
married
,
Madam
?
"
I
looked
a
little
silly
;
and
my
new
mamma
came
up
to
me
,
and
took
my
hand
:
"
Why
,
Jenny
,
you
are
dressed
oddly
to
-
day
!
 
<EOS>
What
a
hoop
you
wear
;
it
makes
you
look
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
tell
how
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Madam
,
I
thought
so
;
what
signifies
lying
?
 
<EOS>
But
'
tis
<EOS>
only
the
hoop
,
I
see
 
<EOS>
Really
,
Lady
Jenny
,
your
hoop
is
enough
to
make
half
a
hundred
of
our
sex
despair
,
lest
you
should
be
married
.
<EOS>
I
thought
it
was
something
!
<EOS>
Few
ladies
escape
my
notice
.
<EOS>
I
always
kept
a
good
look
-
out
;
for
I
have
two
daughters
of
my
own
.
<EOS>
But
'
tis
the
hoop
,
I
see
plainly
enough
.
<EOS>
You
are
so
slender
<EOS>
every
where
but
here
,
"
putting
his
hand
upon
my
hip
which
quite
dashed
me
;
and
I
retired
behind
my
Lady
Countess
's
chair
.
  
<EOS>
"
Fie
,
Sir
Jacob
!
"
said
Mr.
B.
;
"
before
us
young
gentlemen
,
to
take
such
liberties
with
a
maiden
lady
!
<EOS>
You
give
a
bad
example
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Hang
him
that
sets
you
a
bad
example
,
nephew
.
<EOS>
But
I
see
you
're
right
;
I
see
Lady
Jenny
's
a
maiden
lady
,
or
she
would
not
have
been
so
shamefaced
.
<EOS>
I
'll
swear
for
her
on
occasion
.
<EOS>
Ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
 
<EOS>
I
'm
sure
,
"
repeated
he
,
<EOS>
"
she
's
a
maiden
 
<EOS>
For
our
sex
give
the
married
ladies
a
freer
air
in
a
trice
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
How
,
Sir
Jacob
!
"
said
Lady
Davers
.
  
<EOS>
"
O
fie
!
"
said
the
countess
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ca
n't
you
praise
the
maiden
ladies
,
but
at
the
expense
of
the
married
ones
!
<EOS>
What
do
you
see
of
freedom
in
me
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Or
in
me
?
"
said
Lady
Davers
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Nay
,
for
that
matter
you
are
very
well
<EOS>
,
I
must
needs
say
.
<EOS>
But
will
you
pretend
to
blush
with
that
virgin
rose
?
 
<EOS>
Od
's
my
life
,
Miss
 
<EOS>
Lady
Jenny
<EOS>
I
would
say
,
come
from
behind
your
mamma
's
chair
,
and
you
two
ladies
stand
up
now
together
.
<EOS>
There
,
so
you
do
 
Why
now
,
blush
for
blush
,
and
Lady
Jenny
shall
be
three
to
one
,
and
a
deeper
crimson
by
half
.
<EOS>
Look
you
there
else
!
<EOS>
An
hundred
guineas
to
one
against
the
field
.
"
<EOS>
Then
stamping
with
one
foot
,
and
lifting
up
his
hands
and
eyes
<EOS>
"
Lady
Jenny
has
it
all
to
nothing
 
<EOS>
Ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
<EOS>
You
may
well
sit
down
both
of
you
;
but
you
're
a
blush
too
late
,
I
can
tell
you
that
.
<EOS>
Well
hast
thou
done
.
<EOS>
Lady
Jenny
,
"
tapping
my
shoulder
with
his
rough
paw
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
hastening
away
,
and
he
said
,
"
<EOS>
But
let
's
see
you
again
,
Miss
;
for
now
will
I
stay
,
if
they
bring
nobody
else
.
"
<EOS>
And
away
I
went
;
for
I
was
quite
out
of
countenance
,
"
What
a
strange
creature
,
"
thought
I
,
"
is
this
!
"
<EOS>
Supper
being
near
ready
,
he
called
out
for
Lady
Jenny
,
for
the
sight
of
her
<EOS>
,
he
said
,
did
him
good
;
but
he
was
resolved
not
to
sit
down
to
table
with
somebody
else
.
<EOS>
The
countess
said
,
she
would
fetch
her
daughter
;
and
stepping
out
,
returned
saying
,
"
Mrs.
B.
understands
that
Sir
Jacob
is
here
,
and
does
not
choose
to
see
her
;
<EOS>
so
she
begs
to
be
excused
;
and
my
Jenny
<EOS>
and
she
desire
to
sup
together
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
very
worst
tidings
<EOS>
I
have
heard
this
twelvemonth
.
<EOS>
Why
,
nephew
,
let
your
girl
sup
with
any
body
,
so
we
may
have
Lady
Jenny
back
with
us
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
,
"
said
the
countess
,
(
who
was
desirous
to
see
how
far
he
could
carry
it
)
,
<EOS>
"
Jenny
wo
n't
leave
Mrs.
B.
;
so
if
you
see
one
,
you
must
see
t'other
.
<EOS>
"
 
"
Nay
,
then
I
must
sit
down
contented
.
<EOS>
Yet
I
should
be
glad
to
see
Lady
Jenny
.
<EOS>
But
I
will
not
sit
at
table
with
Mr.
B.
's
girl
 
<EOS>
that
's
positive
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
well
,
let
'em
sup
together
,
and
there
's
an
end
of
it
,
"
said
Mr.
B.
<EOS>
"
I
see
my
uncle
has
as
good
a
judgment
as
any
body
of
fine
ladies
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
(
"
That
I
have
,
nephew
.
"
)
 
<EOS>
"
But
he
ca
n't
forgo
his
humour
,
in
compliment
to
the
finest
lady
in
England
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Consider
,
nephew
,
'
tis
not
thy
doing
a
foolish
thing
,
and
calling
a
girl
wife
,
shall
cram
a
niece
down
my
throat
,
that
's
positive
.
<EOS>
The
moment
she
comes
down
to
take
place
of
these
ladies
,
I
am
gone
,
that
's
most
certain
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
then
,
shall
I
go
up
,
and
oblige
Pamela
to
sup
by
herself
,
and
persuade
Lady
Jenny
to
come
down
to
us
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
With
all
my
soul
,
nephew
,
 
a
good
notion
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
Pamela
 
did
you
say
?
 
<EOS>
A
queer
sort
of
name
!
<EOS>
I
have
heard
of
it
somewhere
!
 
<EOS>
Is
it
a
Christian
or
a
Pagan
name
?
 
<EOS>
Linsey
-
woolsey
 
half
one
,
half
<EOS>
t'other
 
like
thy
girl
 
<EOS>
Ha
,
ha
,
ha
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Let
me
be
hang'd
,
"
whispered
Mr.
H.
to
his
aunt
,
"
if
Sir
Jacob
has
not
a
power
of
wit
;
though
he
is
so
whimsical
with
it
.
<EOS>
I
like
him
much
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
hark
ye
,
nephew
,
"
said
Sir
Jacob
,
"
one
word
with
you
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
fob
upon
us
your
girl
with
the
Pagan
name
for
Lady
Jenny
.
<EOS>
I
have
set
a
mark
upon
her
,
and
should
know
her
from
a
thousand
,
although
she
had
changed
her
hoop
.
<EOS>
"
Then
he
laughed
again
,
and
said
,
he
hoped
Lady
Jenny
would
come
 
and
without
any
body
with
her
 
<EOS>
"
But
I
smell
a
plot
,
"
said
he
 
<EOS>
"
By
my
soul
I
wo
n't
stay
,
if
they
both
come
together
.
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
be
put
upon
 
But
here
is
one
or
both
 
<EOS>
Where
's
my
whip
?
 
<EOS>
I
'll
go
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Indeed
,
Mr.
B.
,
I
had
rather
have
staid
with
Mrs.
B.
,
"
said
I
,
as
I
entered
,
as
he
had
bid
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
'
Tis
she
!
'
<EOS>
tis
she
!
<EOS>
You
've
nobody
behind
you
!
 
<EOS>
No
,
she
han't
 
<EOS>
Why
now
,
nephew
,
you
are
right
;
I
was
afraid
you
'd
have
put
a
trick
upon
me
.
 
<EOS>
You
'd
rather
,
"
repeated
he
to
me
,
"
have
staid
with
Mrs.
B.
!
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
I
warrant
 
<EOS>
But
you
shall
be
placed
in
better
company
,
my
dear
child
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Sister
,
"
said
Mr.
B.
,
"
will
you
take
that
chair
;
for
Pamela
does
not
choose
to
give
my
uncle
disgust
,
who
so
seldom
comes
to
see
us
.
<EOS>
"
My
lady
took
the
upper
end
of
the
table
,
and
I
sat
next
below
my
new
mamma
.
"
<EOS>
So
,
Jenny
,
"
said
she
,
"
how
have
you
left
Mrs.
B.
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
A
little
concerned
;
but
she
was
the
easier
,
as
Mr.
B.
himself
desired
I
'd
come
down
.
"
  
<EOS>
My
Lord
Davers
sat
next
me
,
and
Sir
Jacob
said
,
"
Shall
I
beg
a
favour
of
you
,
my
lord
,
to
let
me
sit
next
to
Lady
Jenny
?
"
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
said
,
"
Wo
n't
it
be
better
to
sit
over
-
against
her
,
uncle
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
that
's
right
.
<EOS>
I
'
faith
,
nephew
,
<EOS>
thou
know'st
<EOS>
what
's
right
.
<EOS>
Well
,
so
I
will
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
accordingly
removed
his
seat
,
and
I
was
very
glad
of
it
;
for
though
I
was
sure
to
be
stared
at
by
him
,
yet
I
feared
if
he
sat
next
me
,
he
would
not
keep
his
hands
off
my
hoop
.
  
<EOS>
He
ran
on
a
deal
in
my
praises
,
after
his
manner
,
but
so
rough
at
times
,
that
he
gave
me
pain
;
and
I
was
afraid
too
,
lest
he
should
observe
my
ring
;
but
he
stared
so
much
in
my
face
,
that
it
escaped
his
notice
.
<EOS>
After
supper
,
the
gentlemen
sat
down
to
their
bottle
,
and
the
ladies
and
I
withdrew
,
and
about
twelve
they
broke
up
;
Sir
Jacob
talking
of
nothing
but
Lady
Jenny
,
and
wished
Mr.
B.
had
happily
married
such
a
charming
creature
,
who
carried
tokens
of
her
high
birth
in
her
face
,
and
whose
every
feature
and
look
shewed
her
to
be
nobly
descended
.
  
<EOS>
They
let
him
go
to
bed
with
his
mistake
:
but
the
countess
said
next
morning
,
she
thought
she
never
saw
a
greater
instance
of
stupid
pride
and
churlishness
;
and
should
be
sick
of
the
advantage
of
birth
or
ancestry
,
if
this
was
the
natural
fruit
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
For
a
man
,
"
said
her
ladyship
,
"
to
come
to
his
nephew
's
house
,
and
to
suffer
the
mistress
of
it
to
be
closetted
up
(
as
he
thinks
)
,
in
order
to
humour
his
absurd
and
brutal
insolence
,
and
to
behave
as
he
has
done
,
is
such
a
ridicule
upon
the
pride
of
descent
,
that
I
shall
ever
think
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
O
Mrs.
B.
,
"
said
she
,
"
what
advantages
have
you
over
every
one
that
sees
you
;
but
most
over
those
who
pretend
to
treat
you
unworthily
!
<EOS>
"
I
expect
to
be
called
to
breakfast
every
minute
,
and
shall
then
,
perhaps
,
see
how
this
matter
will
end
.
<EOS>
I
wish
,
when
it
is
revealed
,
he
may
not
be
in
a
fury
,
and
think
himself
imposed
on
.
<EOS>
I
fear
it
wo
n't
go
off
so
well
as
I
wish
;
for
every
body
seems
to
be
grave
,
and
angry
at
Sir
Jacob
.
  
<EOS>
THURSDAY
.
  
<EOS>
I
now
proceed
with
my
tale
.
<EOS>
At
breakfast
-
time
,
when
every
one
was
sat
,
Sir
Jacob
began
to
call
out
for
Lady
Jenny
.
"
<EOS>
But
,
"
said
he
,
"
I
'll
have
none
of
your
girl
,
nephew
:
<EOS>
although
the
chair
at
the
tea
-
table
is
left
for
somebody
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Mr.
B.
,
"
we
'll
get
Lady
Jenny
to
supply
Mrs.
B.
's
place
,
since
you
do
n't
care
to
see
her
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
With
all
my
heart
,
"
replied
he
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
,
uncle
,
"
said
Mr.
B.
,
"
have
you
really
no
desire
,
no
curiosity
to
see
the
girl
I
have
married
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
none
at
all
,
by
my
soul
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Just
then
I
came
in
,
and
paying
my
compliments
to
the
company
,
and
to
Sir
Jacob
 
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
,
"
said
I
,
"
supply
Mrs.
B.
's
place
in
her
absence
?
"
<EOS>
And
down
I
sat
.
<EOS>
After
breakfast
,
and
the
servants
were
withdrawn
 
"
Lady
Jenny
,
"
said
Lady
Davers
,
"
you
are
a
young
lady
,
with
all
the
advantages
of
birth
and
descent
,
and
some
of
the
best
blood
in
the
kingdom
runs
in
your
veins
;
and
here
Sir
Jacob
Swynford
is
your
great
admirer
;
can
not
you
,
from
whom
it
will
come
with
a
double
grace
,
convince
him
that
he
acts
unkindly
at
my
brother
's
house
,
to
keep
the
person
he
has
thought
worthy
of
making
the
mistress
of
it
,
out
of
company
?
<EOS>
And
let
us
know
your
opinion
,
whether
my
brother
himself
does
right
,
to
comply
with
such
an
unreasonable
distaste
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
how
now
,
Lady
Davers
!
<EOS>
This
from
you
!
<EOS>
I
did
not
expect
it
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
uncle
,
"
said
Mr.
B.
,
"
is
the
only
person
in
the
kingdom
that
I
would
have
humoured
thus
:
and
I
made
no
doubt
,
when
he
saw
how
willing
I
was
to
oblige
him
in
such
a
point
,
he
would
have
acted
a
more
generous
part
than
he
has
yet
done
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
Lady
Jenny
,
what
say
you
to
my
sister
's
questions
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
must
speak
my
mind
,
"
replied
I
,
"
I
should
take
the
liberty
to
be
very
serious
with
Sir
Jacob
,
and
to
say
,
that
when
a
thing
is
done
,
and
can
not
be
helped
,
he
should
take
care
how
he
sows
the
seeds
of
indifference
and
animosity
between
man
and
wife
,
and
makes
a
gentleman
dissatisfied
with
his
choice
,
and
perhaps
unhappy
as
long
as
he
lives
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
Miss
,
"
said
he
,
"
if
all
are
against
me
,
and
you
,
whose
good
opinion
I
value
most
,
you
may
e'en
let
the
girl
come
,
and
sit
down
.
 
<EOS>
If
she
is
but
half
as
pretty
,
and
half
as
wise
,
and
modest
,
as
you
,
I
shall
,
as
it
can
not
be
helped
,
as
you
say
,
be
ready
to
think
better
of
the
matter
.
<EOS>
For
'
tis
a
little
hard
,
I
must
needs
say
,
if
she
has
hitherto
appeared
before
all
the
good
company
,
to
keep
her
out
of
the
way
on
my
account
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Really
,
Sir
Jacob
,
"
said
the
countess
,
"
I
have
blushed
for
you
more
than
once
on
this
occasion
.
<EOS>
But
the
mistress
of
this
house
is
more
than
half
as
wise
,
and
modest
,
and
lovely
:
and
in
hopes
you
will
return
me
back
some
of
the
blushes
I
have
lent
you
,
see
there
,
in
my
daughter
Jenny
,
whom
you
have
been
so
justly
admiring
,
the
mistress
of
the
house
,
and
the
lady
with
the
Pagan
name
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Sir
Jacob
sat
aghast
,
looking
at
us
all
in
turn
,
and
then
cast
his
eyes
on
the
floor
.
<EOS>
At
last
,
up
he
got
,
and
swore
a
sad
oath
:
"
And
am
I
thus
tricked
and
bamboozled
,
"
<EOS>
that
was
his
word
;
"
am
I
?
<EOS>
There
's
no
bearing
this
house
,
nor
her
presence
,
now
,
that
's
certain
;
and
I
'll
begone
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
looking
at
me
,
and
nodding
his
head
towards
Sir
Jacob
,
as
he
was
in
a
flutter
to
begone
,
I
rose
from
my
chair
,
and
went
to
him
,
and
took
his
hand
.
<EOS>
"
I
hope
,
Sir
Jacob
,
you
will
be
able
to
bear
both
,
when
you
shall
see
no
other
difference
but
that
of
descent
,
between
the
supposed
Lady
Jenny
you
so
kindly
praised
,
and
the
girl
your
dear
nephew
has
so
much
exalted
.
"
 
"
Let
me
go
,
"
said
he
;
"
I
am
most
confoundedly
bit
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
look
you
in
the
face
!
<EOS>
By
my
soul
,
I
can
not
!
<EOS>
For
'
tis
impossible
you
should
forgive
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Indeed
it
is
not
,
Sir
;
you
have
done
nothing
but
what
I
can
forgive
you
for
,
if
your
dear
nephew
can
;
for
to
him
was
the
wrong
,
if
any
,
and
I
am
sure
he
can
overlook
it
.
<EOS>
And
for
his
sake
,
to
the
uncle
of
so
honoured
a
gentleman
,
to
the
brother
of
my
late
good
lady
,
I
can
,
with
a
bent
knee
,
thus
,
ask
your
blessing
,
and
your
excuse
for
joining
to
keep
you
in
this
suspense
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Bless
you
!
"
<EOS>
said
he
,
and
stamped
 
"
Who
can
choose
but
bless
you?"-and
he
kneeled
down
,
and
wrapped
his
arms
about
me
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
,
curse
me
,
"
that
was
his
strange
word
,
"
if
ever
I
was
so
touched
before
!
"
<EOS>
My
dear
Mr.
B.
,
for
fear
my
spirits
should
be
too
much
affected
(
for
the
rough
baronet
,
in
his
transport
,
had
bent
me
down
lower
than
I
kneeled
)
,
came
and
held
my
arm
;
but
permitted
Sir
Jacob
to
raise
me
;
only
saying
,
"
How
does
my
angel
?
<EOS>
Now
she
has
made
this
conquest
,
she
has
completed
all
her
triumphs
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Angel
,
did
you
call
her
?
 
<EOS>
I
'm
confounded
with
her
goodness
,
and
her
sweet
carriage
!
 
<EOS>
Rise
,
and
let
me
see
if
I
can
stand
myself
!
<EOS>
And
,
believe
me
,
I
am
sorry
I
have
acted
thus
so
much
like
a
bear
;
and
the
more
I
think
of
it
,
the
more
I
shall
be
ashamed
of
myself
.
"
<EOS>
And
the
tears
,
as
he
spoke
,
ran
down
his
rough
cheeks
;
which
moved
me
much
;
for
to
see
a
man
with
so
hard
a
countenance
weep
,
was
a
touching
sight
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
H.
putting
his
handkerchief
to
his
eyes
,
his
aunt
said
,
"
<EOS>
What
's
the
matter
,
Jackey
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
how
'
tis
,
"
answered
he
;
"
<EOS>
but
here
's
strange
doings
<EOS>
,
as
ever
I
knew
 
<EOS>
For
,
day
after
day
,
one
's
ready
to
cry
,
without
knowing
whether
it
be
for
joy
or
sorrow
!
 
<EOS>
What
a
plague
's
the
matter
with
me
,
I
wonder
!
"
<EOS>
And
out
he
went
,
the
two
ladies
,
whose
charming
eyes
,
too
,
glistened
with
pleasure
,
smiling
at
the
effect
the
scene
had
upon
Mr.
H.
and
at
what
he
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Madam
,
"
said
Sir
Jacob
,
approaching
me
;
for
I
had
sat
down
,
but
then
stood
up
 
<EOS>
"
You
will
forgive
me
;
and
from
my
heart
I
wish
you
joy
.
<EOS>
By
my
soul
I
do
,
"
 
and
saluted
me
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
could
not
have
believed
there
had
been
such
a
person
breathing
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
wonder
at
my
nephew
's
loving
you
!
 
<EOS>
And
you
call
her
sister
,
Lady
Davers
,
do
n't
you
?
 
<EOS>
If
you
do
,
I
'll
own
her
for
my
niece
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
n't
I
!
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
I
do
,
"
said
she
,
coming
to
me
,
"
and
am
proud
so
to
call
her
.
<EOS>
And
this
I
tell
you
,
for
your
comfort
,
though
to
my
own
shame
,
that
I
used
her
worse
than
you
have
done
,
before
I
knew
her
excellence
;
and
have
repented
of
it
ever
since
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
bowed
to
her
ladyship
,
and
kissed
her
hand
 
<EOS>
"
My
dearest
lady
,
"
said
I
,
"
you
have
made
me
such
rich
amends
since
,
that
I
am
sure
I
may
say
,
"
It
was
good
for
me
that
I
was
afflicted
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
nephew
,
she
has
the
fear
of
God
<EOS>
,
I
perceive
,
before
her
eyes
too
!
<EOS>
I
'm
sure
I
've
heard
those
words
.
<EOS>
They
are
somewhere
in
the
Scripture
,
I
believe
!
 
<EOS>
Why
,
who
knows
but
she
may
be
a
means
to
save
your
soul
!
 
<EOS>
Hey
,
you
know
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
Sir
Jacob
,
she
'll
be
a
means
to
save
a
hundred
souls
,
and
might
go
a
great
way
to
save
yours
if
you
were
to
live
with
her
but
one
month
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Well
,
but
,
nephew
,
I
hope
you
forgive
me
too
;
for
now
I
think
of
it
<EOS>
,
I
never
knew
you
take
any
matter
so
patiently
in
my
life
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
knew
,
"
said
Mr.
B.
,
"
that
every
extravagance
you
insisted
upon
,
was
heightening
my
charmer
's
triumph
,
and
increasing
your
own
contrition
;
and
,
as
I
was
not
indeed
deprived
of
her
company
,
I
could
bear
with
every
thing
you
said
or
did
 
<EOS>
Yet
,
do
n't
you
remember
my
caution
,
that
the
less
you
said
against
her
,
the
less
you
'd
have
to
unsay
,
and
the
less
to
repent
of
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
;
and
let
me
ride
out
,
and
call
myself
to
account
for
all
I
have
said
against
her
,
in
her
own
hearing
;
and
when
I
can
think
of
but
one
half
,
and
how
she
has
taken
it
,
by
my
soul
,
I
believe
'
twill
make
me
more
than
half
mad
.
"
  
<EOS>
At
dinner
(
when
we
had
Mr.
Williams
's
company
)
,
the
baronet
told
me
,
he
admired
me
now
,
as
much
as
when
he
thought
me
Lady
Jenny
;
but
complained
of
the
trick
put
upon
him
by
us
all
,
and
seemed
now
and
then
a
little
serious
upon
it
.
  
<EOS>
He
took
great
notice
of
the
dexterity
which
he
imputed
to
me
,
in
performing
the
honours
of
the
table
.
<EOS>
And
every
now
and
then
,
he
lifted
up
his
eyes
 
"
Very
clever
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
Madam
,
you
seem
to
me
to
be
born
to
these
things
!
 
<EOS>
I
will
be
helped
by
nobody
but
you
 
<EOS>
And
you
'll
have
a
task
of
it
<EOS>
,
I
can
tell
you
;
for
I
have
a
whipping
stomach
,
and
were
there
fifty
dishes
<EOS>
,
I
always
taste
of
every
one
.
"
<EOS>
And
,
indeed
,
John
was
in
a
manner
wholly
employed
in
going
to
and
fro
between
the
baronet
and
me
,
for
half
an
hour
together
.
 
<EOS>
He
went
from
us
afterwards
to
Mrs.
Jervis
,
and
made
her
answer
many
questions
about
me
,
and
how
all
these
matters
had
come
about
,
as
he
phrased
it
;
and
returning
,
when
we
drank
coffee
,
said
,
"
I
have
been
confabbing
with
Mrs.
Jervis
,
about
you
,
niece
.
<EOS>
I
never
heard
the
like
!
<EOS>
She
says
you
can
play
on
the
harpsichord
,
and
sing
too
;
will
you
let
a
body
have
a
tune
<EOS>
or
so
?
<EOS>
My
Mab
can
play
pretty
well
,
and
so
can
Dolly
;
I
'm
a
judge
of
music
,
and
would
fain
hear
you
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I
said
,
if
he
was
a
judge
,
I
should
be
afraid
to
play
before
him
;
but
I
would
not
be
asked
twice
,
after
our
coffee
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
he
repeated
his
request
.
<EOS>
I
gave
him
a
tune
,
and
,
at
his
desire
,
sung
to
it
:
<EOS>
"
Od
's
my
life
,
"
said
he
,
"
you
do
it
purely
!

held
both
hands
out

a
fine

shewed
he

Plague

you

put
another

was
his
polite

<EOS>
Lady
Davers
,
you
know
not
the
money
they
have
cost
me
to
qualify
them
;
and
here
's
a
mere
baby
to
them

'em
by
a

without
any

Go
over
that
again
 
Confound
me
for

<EOS>
I
lost
it
by
my
prating
.
 
<EOS>
Ay
,
there
you
have
it
!
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
that
I
could
but
dance
as
well
as
thou
sing'st

<EOS>
I
'd
give
you
a
saraband

old

"
  
<EOS>
After
supper
,
we
fell
into
a
conversation
,
of
which
I
must
give
you
some
account
,
being
on
a
topic
that
Mr.
B.
has
been
blamed
for
in
his
marrying
me
,
and
which
has
stuck
by
some
of
his
friends
,
even
after
they
have
,
in
kindness
to
me
,
acquitted
him
in
every
other
respect
;
and
that
is
,
the
example
he
has
set
to
young
gentlemen
of
family
and
fortune
to
marry
beneath
them
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
begun
by
Sir
Jacob
,
who
said
,
"
I
am
in
love
with
my
new
niece
,
that
I
am
:
<EOS>
but
still
one
thing
sticks
with
me
in
this
affair
,
which
is
,
what
will
become
of
degree
or
distinction
,
<EOS>
if
this
practice
of
gentlemen
marrying
their
mothers
'
waiting
-
maids
 
excuse
me
,
Madam
 
should
come
into
vogue
?
<EOS>
Already
,
young
ladies
and
young
gentlemen
are
too
apt
to
be
drawn
away
thus
,
and
disgrace
their
families
.
<EOS>
We
have
too
many
instances
of
this
.
<EOS>
You
'll
forgive
me
,
both
of
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
,
"
said
Lady
Davers
,
"
is
the
only
thing
!
 
<EOS>
Sir
Jacob
has
hit
upon
the
point
that
would
make
one
wish
this
example
had
not
been
set
by
a
gentleman
of
such
an
ancient
family
,
till
one
becomes
acquainted
with
this
dear
creature
;
and
then
every
body
thinks
it
should
not
be
otherwise
than
it
is
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
Pamela
,
"
said
Mr.
B.
,
"
what
can
you
say
to
this
?
<EOS>
Can
not
you
defend
me
from
this
charge
?
<EOS>
This
is
a
point
that
has
been
often
objected
to
me
;
try
for
one
of
your
pretty
arguments
in
my
behalf
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
,
Sir
,
"
replied
I
,
looking
down
,
"
it
becomes
not
me
to
say
any
thing
to
this
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
indeed
it
does
,
if
you
can
:
and
I
beg
you
'll
help
me
to
some
excuse
,
if
you
have
any
at
hand
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Wo
n't
you
.
<EOS>
Sir
,
dispense
with
me
on
this
occasion
?
<EOS>
I
know
,
not
what
to
say
.
<EOS>
Indeed
I
should
not
,
if
I
may
judge
for
myself
,
speak
one
word
to
this
subject
.
 
<EOS>
For
it
is
my
absolute
opinion
,
that
degrees
in
general
should
be
kept
up
;
although
I
must
always
deem
the
present
case
an
happy
exception
to
the
rule
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
looked
as
if
he
still
expected
I
should
say
something
.
 
<EOS>
"
Wo
n't
you
,
Sir
,
dispense
with
me
?
"
<EOS>
repeated
I.
"
<EOS>
Indeed
I
should
not
speak
to
this
point
,
if
I
may
be
my
own
judge
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
always
intend
,
my
dear
,
you
shall
judge
for
yourself
;
and
,
you
know
,
I
seldom
urge
you
farther
,
when
you
use
those
words
.
<EOS>
But
if
you
have
any
thing
upon
your
mind
to
say
,
let
's
have
it
;
for
your
arguments
are
always
new
and
unborrowed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
then
,
if
I
must
,
Sir
,
ask
,
if
there
be
not
a
nation
,
or
if
there
has
not
been
a
law
in
some
nation
,
which
,
whenever
a
young
gentleman
,
be
his
degree
what
it
would
,
has
seduced
a
poor
creature
,
be
her
degree
<EOS>
what
it
would
,
obliges
him
to
marry
that
unhappy
person
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
there
is
such
a
law
in
some
country
<EOS>
,
I
ca
n't
tell
where
,
"
said
Sir
Jacob
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
do
you
think
,
Sir
,
whether
it
be
so
or
not
,
that
it
is
equitable
it
should
be
so
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
by
my
troth
.
<EOS>
Though
I
must
needs
own
,
if
it
were
so
in
England
,
many
men
,
that
I
know
,
would
not
have
the
wives
they
now
have
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
speak
to
your
knowledge
,
I
doubt
not
,
Sir
Jacob
?
"
said
Mr.
B.
  
"
Why
,
truly
 
I
do
n't
know
<EOS>
but
I
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
All
then
,
"
said
I
,
"
that
I
would
infer
,
is
,
whether
another
law
would
not
be
a
still
more
just
and
equitable
one
,
that
the
gentleman
who
is
repulsed
,
from
a
principle
of
virtue
and
honour
,
should
not
be
censured
for
marrying
a
person
he
could
not
seduce
?
<EOS>
And
whether
it
is
not
more
for
both
their
honours
,
if
he
does
:
since
it
is
nobler
to
reward
a
virtue
,
than
to
repair
a
shame
,
were
that
shame
to
be
repaired
by
matrimony
,
which
I
take
the
liberty
to
doubt
.
<EOS>
But
I
beg
pardon
<EOS>
:
you
commanded
me
,
Sir
,
else
this
subject
should
not
have
found
a
speaker
to
it
,
in
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
This
is
admirably
said
,
"
cried
Sir
Jacob
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
yet
this
comes
not
up
to
the
objection
,
"
said
Mr.
B.
<EOS>
"
The
setting
an
example
to
waiting
-
maids
to
aspire
,
and
to
young
gentlemen
to
descend
.
<EOS>
And
I
will
enter
into
the
subject
myself
;
and
the
rather
,
because
as
I
go
along
,
I
will
give
Sir
Jacob
a
faint
sketch
of
the
merit
and
character
of
my
Pamela
,
of
which
he
can
not
be
so
well
informed
as
he
has
been
of
the
disgrace
which
he
imagined
I
had
brought
upon
myself
by
marrying
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
it
necessary
,
that
as
well
those
persons
who
are
afraid
the
example
should
be
taken
,
as
those
who
are
inclined
to
follow
it
,
should
consider
all
the
material
parts
of
it
;
otherwise
,
I
think
the
precedent
may
be
justly
cleared
;
and
the
fears
of
the
one
be
judged
groundless
,
and
the
plea
of
the
other
but
a
pretence
,
in
order
to
cover
a
folly
into
which
they
would
have
fallen
,
whether
they
had
this
example
or
not
.
<EOS>
For
instance
,
in
order
to
lay
claim
to
the
excuses
,
which
my
conduct
,
if
I
may
suppose
it
of
force
enough
to
do
either
good
or
hurt
,
will
furnish
,
it
is
necessary
,
that
the
object
of
their
wish
should
be
a
girl
of
exquisite
beauty
(
and
that
not
only
in
their
own
blinded
and
partial
judgments
,
but
in
the
opinion
of
every
one
who
sees
her
,
friend
or
foe
)
,
in
order
to
justify
the
force
which
the
first
attractions
have
upon
him
:
that
she
be
descended
of
honest
and
conscientious
,
though
poor
and
obscure
parents
;
who
having
preserved
their
integrity
,
through
great
trials
and
afflictions
,
have
,
by
their
examples
,
as
well
as
precepts
,
laid
deep
in
the
girl
's
mind
the
foundations
of
piety
and
virtue
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
necessary
that
,
to
the
charms
of
person
,
this
waiting
-
maid
,
should
have
an
humble
,
teachable
mind
,
fine
natural
parts
,
a
sprightly
,
yet
inoffensive
wit
,
a
temper
so
excellent
,
and
a
judgment
so
solid
,
as
should
promise
(
by
the
love
and
esteem
these
qualities
should
attract
to
herself
from
her
fellow
-
servants
,
superior
and
inferior
)
that
she
would
become
a
higher
station
,
and
be
respected
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
And
that
,
after
so
good
a
foundation
laid
by
her
parents
,
she
should
have
all
the
advantages
of
female
education
conferred
upon
her
;
the
example
of
an
excellent
lady
,
improving
and
building
upon
so
worthy
a
foundation
:
a
capacity
surprisingly
ready
to
take
in
all
that
is
taught
her
:
an
attention
,
assiduity
,
and
diligence
almost
peculiar
to
herself
,
at
her
time
of
life
;
so
as
,
at
fifteen
or
sixteen
years
of
age
,
to
be
able
to
vie
with
any
young
ladies
of
rank
,
as
well
in
the
natural
genteelness
of
her
person
,
as
in
her
acquirements
:
and
that
in
nothing
but
her
humility
she
should
manifest
any
difference
between
herself
and
the
high
-
born
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
will
be
necessary
,
moreover
,
that
she
should
have
a
mind
above
temptation
;
that
she
should
resist
the
offers
and
menaces
of
one
upon
whom
all
her
worldly
happiness
seemed
to
depend
;
the
son
of
a
lady
to
whom
she
owed
the
greatest
obligations
;
a
person
whom
she
did
not
hate
,
but
greatly
feared
,
and
whom
her
grateful
heart
would
have
been
glad
to
oblige
;
and
who
sought
to
prevail
over
her
virtue
,
by
all
the
inducements
that
could
be
thought
of
,
to
attract
a
young
unexperienced
virgin
at
one
time
,
or
to
frighten
her
at
another
,
into
his
purposes
;
who
offered
her
very
high
terms
,
her
circumstances
considered
,
as
well
for
herself
,
as
for
parents
she
loved
better
than
herself
,
whose
circumstances
were
low
and
distressful
;
yet
,
to
all
these
offers
and
menaces
,
that
she
should
be
able
to
answer
in
such
words
as
these
,
which
will
always
dwell
upon
my
memory
<EOS>
"
I
reject
your
proposals
with
all
my
soul
.
<EOS>
May
God
desert
me
,
whenever
I
make
worldly
grandeur
my
chiefest
<EOS>
good
!
<EOS>
I
know
I
am
in
your
power
;
I
dread
your
will
to
ruin
me
<EOS>
is
as
great
as
your
power
.
<EOS>
Yet
,
will
I
dare
to
tell
you
,
I
will
make
no
free
-
will
offering
of
my
virtue
.
<EOS>
All
that
I
can
do
,
poor
as
it
is
,
I
will
do
,
to
shew
you
,
that
my
will
bore
no
part
in
the
violation
of
me
.
"
<EOS>
And
when
future
marriage
was
intimated
to
her
,
to
induce
her
to
yield
,
to
be
able
to
answer
,
"
<EOS>
The
moment
I
yield
to
your
proposals
,
there
is
an
end
of
all
merit
,
if
now
I
have
any
.
<EOS>
And
I
should
be
so
far
from
expecting
such
an
honour
that
I
will
pronounce
I
should
be
most
unworthy
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
,
I
say
,
such
a
girl
can
be
found
,
thus
beautifully
attractive
in
every
one
's
eye
,
and
not
partially
so
only
in
a
young
gentle
man
's
own
;
and
after
that
(
what
good
persons
would
infinitely
prefer
to
beauty
)
,
thus
piously
principled
;
thus
genteely
educated
and
accomplished
;
thus
brilliantly
witty
;
thus
prudent
,
modest
,
generous
,
undesigning
;
and
having
been
thus
tempted
,
thus
tried
,
by
the
man
she
hated
not
,
pursued
(
not
intriguingly
pursuing
)
,
be
thus
inflexibly
virtuous
,
and
proof
against
temptation
<EOS>
:
let
her
reform
her
libertine
,
and
let
him
marry
her
;
and
were
he
of
princely
extraction
,
I
dare
answer
for
it
,
that
no
two
princes
in
one
age
,
take
the
world
through
,
would
be
in
danger
.
<EOS>
For
,
although
I
am
sensible
it
is
not
to
my
credit
,
I
will
say
,
that
I
never
met
with
a
repulse
,
nor
a
conduct
like
this
;
and
yet
I
never
sunk
very
low
for
the
subjects
of
my
attempts
,
either
at
home
or
abroad
.
<EOS>
These
are
obvious
inferences
,
"
added
he
,
"
not
refinements
upon
my
Pamela
's
story
;
and
if
the
gentlemen
were
capable
of
thought
and
comparison
,
would
rather
make
such
an
example
,
as
is
apprehended
,
more
than
less
difficult
than
before
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
if
,
indeed
,
the
young
fellow
be
such
a
booby
,
that
he
can
not
reflect
and
compare
,
and
take
the
case
with
all
its
circumstances
together
<EOS>
,
I
think
his
good
papa
or
mamma
should
get
him
a
wife
to
their
own
liking
,
as
soon
as
possible
;
and
the
poorest
girl
in
England
,
who
is
honest
,
should
rather
bless
herself
for
escaping
such
a
husband
,
than
glory
in
the
catch
she
would
have
of
him
.
<EOS>
For
he
would
hardly
do
honour
to
his
family
in
any
one
instance
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Indeed
,
"
said
the
countess
,
"
it
would
be
pity
,
after
all
,
that
such
an
one
should
marry
any
lady
of
prudence
and
birth
;
for
'
tis
enough
in
conscience
,
that
he
is
a
disgrace
to
one
worthy
family
;
it
would
be
pity
he
should
make
two
unhappy

Why

really

nephew

said
Sir
Jacob

I

you
have
said
much
to
the
purpose

There
is
not
so
much
danger

from
the
example

as
I
apprehended

from
sensible

said

his
inducements
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Not
many
,
I
believe
,
sister
.
<EOS>
For
when
'
tis
known
,
I
have
some
character
in
the
world
,
and
am
not
quite
an
idiot
(
and
my
faults
,
in
having
not
been
one
of
the
most
virtuous
of
men
,
will
stand
me
in
some
stead
in
this
case
,
though
hardly
in
any
other
)
<EOS>
they
will
naturally
enquire
into
my
inducements
.
 
<EOS>
But
see
you
not
,
when
we
go
abroad
,
what
numbers
of
people
her
character
draws
to
admire
the
dear
creature
?
<EOS>
Does
not
this
shew
,
that
her
virtue
has
made
her
more
conspicuous
than
my
fortune
has
made
me
?
<EOS>
For
I
passed
up
and
down
quietly
enough
before
(
handsome
as
my
equipage
always
was
)
and
attracted
not
any
body
's
notice
:
and
indeed
I
had
as
lieve
<EOS>
these
honours
were
not
so
publicly
paid
her
;
for
even
,
were
I
fond
to
shew
and
parade
<EOS>
,
what
are
they
,
but
a
reproach
to
me
?
<EOS>
And
can
I
have
any
excellence
,
but
<EOS>
a
secondary
one
,
in
having
,
after
all
my
persecutions
of
her
,
done
but
common
justice
to
her
merit
?
 
<EOS>
This
answers
your
objection
,
Lady
Davers
,
and
shews
that
my
inducements
and
her
story
must
be
equally
known
.
<EOS>
And
I
really
think
(
every
thing
I
have
said
considered
,
and
that
might
still
farther
be
urged
,
and
the
conduct
of
the
dear
creature
in
the
station
she
adorns
,
so
much
exceeding
all
I
hoped
or
could
expect
from
the
most
promising
appearances
)
,
that
she
does
me
more
honour
than
I
have
done
her
;
and
if
I
could
put
myself
in
a
third
person
's
place
,
I
think
I
should
be
of
the
same
opinion
,
were
I
to
determine
upon
such
another
pair
,
exactly
circumstanced
as
we
are
.
"
  
<EOS>
You
may
believe
,
my
friend
,
how
much
this
generous
defence
of
the
step
he
had
taken
,
attributing
every
thing
to
me
,
and
deprecating
his
worthy
self
,
affected
me
.
<EOS>
I
played
with
a
cork
one
while
,
with
my
rings
another
;
looking
down
,
and
every
way
<EOS>
but
on
the
company
;
for
they
gazed
too
much
upon
me
all
the
time
;
so
that
I
could
only
glance
a
tearful
eye
now
and
then
upon
the
dear
man
;
and
when
it
would
overflow
,
catch
in
my
handkerchief
the
escaped
fugitives
that
would
start
unbidden
beyond
their
proper
limits
,
though
I
often
tried
,
by
a
twinkling
motion
,
to
disperse
the
gathering
water
,
before
it
had
formed
itself
into
drops
too
big
to
be
restrained
.
<EOS>
All
the
company
praised
the
dear
generous
speaker
;
and
he
was
pleased
to
say
farther
,
"
Although
,
my
good
friends
,
I
can
truly
say
,
that
with
all
the
pride
of
family
,
and
the
insolence
of
fortune
,
which
once
made
me
doubt
whether
I
should
not
sink
too
low
,
if
I
made
my
Pamela
my
mistress
(
for
I
should
then
have
treated
her
not
ungenerously
,
and
should
have
suffered
her
,
perhaps
,
to
call
herself
by
my
name
)
,
I
have
never
once
repented
of
what
I
have
done
;
on
the
contrary
,
always
rejoiced
in
it
,
and
it
has
been
,
from
the
first
day
of
our
marriage
,
my
pride
and
my
boast
(
and
shall
be
,
let
others
say
what
they
will
)
,
that
I
can
call
such
an
excellence
,
and
such
a
purity
,
which
I
so
little
deserve
,
mine
;
and
I
look
down
with
contempt
upon
the
rashness
of
all
who
reflect
upon
me
;
for
they
can
have
no
notion
of
my
happiness
or
her
merit
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
O
dear
Sir
,
how
do
you
overrate
my
poor
merit
!
 
<EOS>
Some
persons
are
happy
in
a
life
of
comforts
,
but
mine
's
a
life
of
joy
!
 
<EOS>
One
rapturous
instance
follows
another
so
fast
,
that
I
know
not
how
to
bear
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Whew
!
"
whistled
Sir
Jacob
.
<EOS>
"
Whereabouts
am
I
?
 
<EOS>
I
hope
by
-
and
-
<EOS>
by
you
'll
come
down
to
our
pitch
,
that
one
may
put
in
a
word
or
two
with
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
May
you
be
long
thus
blest
and
happy
together
!
"
said
Lady
Davers
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
not
which
to
admire
most
,
the
dear
girl
that
never
was
bad
,
or
the
dear
man
,
who
,
having
been
bad
,
is
now
so
good
!
"
  
<EOS>
Said
Lord
Davers
,
"
There
is
hardly
any
bearing
these
moving
scenes
,
following
one
another
so
quick
,
as
my
sister
says
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
countess
was
pleased
to
say
,
that
till
now
she
had
been
at
a
loss
to
form
any
notion
of
the
happiness
of
the
first
pair
before
the
Fall
;
but
now
,
by
so
fine
an
instance
as
this
,
she
comprehended
it
in
all
its
force
.
<EOS>
"
God
continue
you
to
one
another
,
"
added
she
,
"
for
a
credit
to
the
state
,
and
to
human
nature
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
H.
,
having
his
elbows
on
the
table
,
folded
his
hands
,
shaking
them
,
and
looking
down
 
<EOS>
"
Egad
,
this
is
uncommon
life
,
that
it
is
!
<EOS>
Your
two
souls
,
I
can
see
that
,
are
like
well
-
tuned
instruments
;
but
they
are
too
high
set
for
me
,
a
vast
deal
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
best
thing
,
"
said
Lady
Davers
(
always
severe
upon
her
poor
nephew
)
,
"
thou
ever
saidst
.
<EOS>
The
music
must
be
equal
to
that
of
Orpheus
,
which
can
make
such
a
savage
as
thee
dance
to
it

<EOS>
I
charge
thee
,
say
not
another
word
tonight
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
indeed
,
aunt
,
"
returned
he
,
laughing
,
"
I
believe
it
was
pretty
well
said
for
your
foolish
fellow
:
though
it
was
by
chance
,
I
must
confess
;
I
did
not
think
of
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
I
believe
,
"
replied
my
lady
;
"
<EOS>
if
thou
hadst
,
thou'dst
not
have
spoken
so
well

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Sir
Jacob
and
Mr.
B.
afterwards
fell
into
a
family
discourse
;
and
Sir
Jacob
told
us
of
two
or
three
courtships
by
his
three
sons
,
and
to
his
two
daughters
,
and
his
reasons
for
disallowing
them
:
and
I
could
observe
,
he
is
an
absolute
tyrant
in
his
family
,
though
they
are
all
men
and
women
grown
,
and
he
seemed
to
please
himself
how
much
they
stood
in
awe
of
him
.
  
<EOS>
I
would
not
have
been
so
tediously
trifling
,
but
for
the
sake
of
my
dear
parents
;
and
there
is
so
much
self
-
praise
,
as
it
may
seem
,
from
a
person
on
repeating
the
fine
things
said
of
herself
,
that
I
am
half
of
opinion
I
should
send
them
to
Kent
only
,
and
to
think
you
should
be
obliged
to
me
for
saving
you
so
much
trouble
and
impertinence
.
  
<EOS>
Do
,
dear
Miss
,
be
so
free
as
to
forbid
me
to
send
you
any
more
long
journals
,
but
common
letters
only
,
of
how
you
do
?
<EOS>
and
who
and
who
's
together
,
and
of
respects
to
one
another
,
and
so
forth
 
letters
that
one
might
dispatch
,
as
Sir
Jacob
says
,
in
a
twinkling
,
and
perhaps
be
more
to
the
purpose
than
the
tedious
scrawl
which
kisses
your
hands
,
from
yours
most
sincerely
,
<EOS>
P.B.
  
Do
,
dear
good
Sir
Simon
<EOS>
,
let
Miss
Polly
add
to
our
delights
,
by
her
charming
company
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Murray
,
and
the
new
affair
will
divert
you
,
in
her
absence
.
 
<EOS>
So
pray
,
since
my
good
Lady
Darnford
has
consented
,
and
she
is
willing
,
and
her
sister
can
spare
her
;
do
n't

so
cross
as

From
Miss
Damford
to
Mrs.
B.
  
MY
DEAR
MRS
.
<EOS>
B.
,
  
<EOS>
You
have
given
us
great
pleasure
in
your
accounts
of
your
conversations
,
and
of
the
verses
put
so
wickedly
under
your
seat
;
and
in
your
just
observations
on
the
lines
,
and
occasions
.
  
<EOS>
I
am
quite
shocked
,
when
I
think
of
Lady
Davers
's
passionate
intentions
at
the
hall
,
but
have
let
nobody
into
the
worst
of
the
matter
,
in
compliance
with
your
desire
.
<EOS>
We
are
delighted
with
the
account
of
your
family
management
,
and
your
Sunday
's
service
.
<EOS>
What
an
excellent
lady
you
are
!
<EOS>
And
how
happy
and
good
you
make
all
who
know
you
,
is
seen
by
the
ladies
joining
in
your
evening
service
,
as
well
as
their
domestics
.
  
<EOS>
We
go
on
here
swimmingly
with
our
courtship
.
<EOS>
Never
was
there
a
fonder
couple
than
Mr.
Murray
and
Miss
Nancy
.
<EOS>
The
modest
girl
is
quite
alive
,
easy
,
and
pleased
,
except
now
-
and
-
then
with
me
.
<EOS>
We
had
a
sad
falling
out
t'other
day
.
<EOS>
Thus
it
was
:
 
She
had
the
assurance
,
on
my
saying
,
they
were
so
fond
and
free
before
-
hand
,
that
they
would
leave
nothing
for
improvement
afterwards
,
to
tell
me
,
she
had
long
perceived
,
that
my
envy
was
very
disquieting
to
me
.
<EOS>
This
she
said
before
Mr.
Murray
,
who
had
the
good
manners
to
retire
,
seeing
a
storm
rising
between
us
.
"
<EOS>
Poor
foolish
girl
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
cried
I
,
<EOS>
when
he
was
gone
,
provoked
to
great
contempt
by
her
expression
before
him
,
"
thou
wilt
make
me
despise
thee
in
spite
of
my
heart
.
<EOS>
But
,
pr'ythee
,
manage
thy
matters
with
common
decency
,
at
least
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Good
lack
!
<EOS>
Common
decency
,
did
you
say
?
<EOS>
When
my
sister
Polly
is
able
to
shew
me
what
it
is
,
I
shall
hope
to
be
better
for
her
example
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
thou'lt
never
be
better
for
any
body
's
example
!
<EOS>
Thy
ill
-
nature
and
perverseness
will
continue
to
keep
thee
from
that
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
My
ill
-
temper
,
you
have
often
told
me
,
is
natural
to
me
;
so
it
must
become
me
:
but
upon
such
a
sweet
-
tempered
young
lady
as
Miss
Polly
,
her
late
assumed
petulance
sits
but
ill
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
have
had
no
bad
temper
,
and
that
every
one
says
,
to
bear
with
thy
sullen
and
perverse
one
,
as
I
have
done
all
my
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
why
ca
n't
you
bear
with
it
a
little
longer
,
sister
?
<EOS>
Does
any
thing
provoke
you
now
"
(
with
a
sly
leer
and
affected
drawl
)
"
that
did
not
formerly
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Provoke
me
!
 
<EOS>
What
should
provoke
me
?
<EOS>
I
gave
thee
but
a
hint
of
thy
fond
folly
,
which
makes
thee
behave
<EOS>
so
before
company
,
that
every
one
smiles
at
thee
<EOS>
;
and
I
'd
be
glad
to
save
thee
from
contempt
for
thy
new
good
humour
,
as
I
used
to
try
to
do
,
for
thy
old
bad
nature
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
that
it
?
<EOS>
What
a
kind
sister
have
I
!
<EOS>
But
I
see
it
vexes
you
;
and
ill
-
natured
folks
love
to
teaze
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
But
,
dear
Polly
,
do
n't
let
the
affection
Mr.
Murray
expresses
for
me
,
put
such
a
good
-
tempered
body
out
of
humour
,
pray
<EOS>
do
n't
 
Who
knows
"
<EOS>
(
continued
the
provoker
,
who
never
says
a
tolerable
thing
that
is
not
ill
-
natured
)
"
<EOS>
but
the
gentleman
may
be
happy
that
he
has
found
a
way
,
with
so
much
ease
,
to
dispense
with
the
difficulty
that
eldership
laid
him
under
?
<EOS>
But
,
as
he
did
you
the
favour
to
let
the
repulse
come
from
you
,
do
n't
be
angry
,
sister
,
that
he
took
you
at
the
first
word
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
,
"
said
I
,
with
a
contemptuous
smile
,
"
thou'rt
in
the
right
,
Nancy
,
to
take
the
gentleman
at
his
first
word
.
<EOS>
Hold
him
fast
,
and
play
over
all
thy
monkey
tricks
with
him
,
with
all
my
heart
;
who
knows
but
it
may
engage
him
more
?
<EOS>
For
,
should
he
leave
thee
,
I
might
be
too
much
provoked
at
thy
ingratitude
,
to
turn
over
another
gentleman
to
thee
.
<EOS>
And
let
me
tell
thee
,
without
such
an
introduction
,
thy
temper
would
keep
any
body
from
thee
,
that
knows
it
!
"
  
"
<EOS>
Poor
Miss
Polly
 
Come
,
be
as
easy
as
you
can
!
<EOS>
Who
knows
but
we
may
find
out
some
cousin
or
friend
of
Mr.
Murray
's
between
us
,
that
we
may
persuade
to
address
you
?
<EOS>
Do
n't
make
us
your
enemies
:
we
'll
try
to
make
you
easy
,
if
we
can
.
'
<EOS>
Tis
a
little
hard
,
that
you
should
be
so
cruelly
taken
at
your
word
,
that
it
is
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Dost
think

said
I
,
"
poor
,
stupid
,
ill
-
judging
Nancy
,
that
I
can
have
the

regret

parting
with

man
I
could
not
like

Mr.

up

I

No

it
was
necessary

one
nail
should
drive
out
another

thou'dst
been
repining
still

not
Mr.
Murray
been
turned
over
to
thee

"
 
<EOS>
"
Turned
over

<EOS>
You
used
that
word
once
before

such
great
wits

you
,
methinks
,
should
not
use
the
same
word
twice

dost
thou
know

wits
<EOS>
should

should
not
do

Thou
hast
<EOS>
no
talent
but
ill
-
nature
;
and
'
tis
enough
for
thee
,
that
one
view
takes
up
thy
whole
thought
.
<EOS>
Pursue
that
 
<EOS>
But
I
would
only
caution
thee
,
not
to
satiate
where
thou
wouldst
oblige
,
that
's
all
;
or
,
if
thy
man
can
be
so
gross
as
to
like
thy
fondness
,
to
leave
something
for
hereafter
.

<EOS>

I
'll
call
him
in
again

you
shall
acquaint
us
how
you
'd
have
it

Bell

(
for
the
maid
came
in
just
then
)
,
"
tell
Mr.
Murray
I
desire
him
to
walk
in
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
'm
glad
to
see
thee
so
teachable
all
at
once
!
 
<EOS>
I
find
now
what
was
the
cause
of
thy
constant
perverseness
:
for
had
the
unavailing
lessons
my
mamma
was
always
inculcating
into
thee
,
come
from
a
man
thou
couldst
have
had
hopes
of
<EOS>
,
they
had
succeeded
better
.
"
  
<EOS>
In
came
Sir
Simon
with
his
crutch
-
stick
 
<EOS>
But
can
you
bear
this
nonsense
,
Mrs.
B.
?
 
<EOS>
"
What
sparring
,
jangling
again
,
you
sluts
!
 
<EOS>
O
what
fiery
eyes
on
one
side
!
<EOS>
and
contemptuous
looks
on
t'other
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
papa
,
my
sister
Polly
has
turned
over
Mr.
Murray
to
me
,
and
she
wants
him
back
again
,
and
he
wo
n't
come
 
<EOS>
That
's
all
the
matter
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
Nancy
,
papa
,
never
could
bear
reproof
,
and
yet
would
always
deserve
it
!
 
<EOS>
I
was
only
gently
remarking
for
her
instruction
,
on
her
fondness
before
company
,
and
she
is
as
she
used
to
be
!
 
<EOS>
Courtship
,
indeed
,
is
a
new
thing
to
the
poor
girl
,
and
so
she
knows
not
how
to
behave
herself
in
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
So
,
Polly
,
because
you
have
been
able
to
run
over
a
long
list
of
humble
servants
,
you
must
insult
your
sister
,
must
you
?
 
<EOS>
But
are
you
really
concerned
,
Polly
?
 
<EOS>
Hey
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
this
or
anything
is
very
well
from
you
.
<EOS>
But
these
imputations
of
envy
,
before
Mr.
Murray
,
must
make
the
man
very
considerable
with
himself
.
<EOS>
Poor
Nancy
do
n't
consider
that
.
<EOS>
But
,
indeed
,
how
should
she
?
<EOS>
How
should
she
be
able
to
reflect
,
who
knows
not
what
reflection
is
,
except
of
the
spiteful
sort
?
<EOS>
But
,
papa
,
should
the
poor
thing
add
to
his
vanity
,
which
wants
no
addition
,
at
the
expense
of
that
pride
,
which
can
only
preserve
her
from
contempt
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
saw
her
affected
,
and
was
resolved
to
pursue
my
advantage
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pr'ythee
,
Nancy
,
"
continued
I
,
"
<EOS>
canst
thou
not
have
a
little
patience
,
child
 
<EOS>
My
papa
will
set
the
day
as
soon
as
he
shall
think
it
proper
.
<EOS>
And
do
n't
let
thy
man
toil
to
keep
pace
with
thy
fondness
;
for
I
have
pitied
him
many
a
time
,
when
I
have
seen
him
stretched
on
the
tenters
to
keep
thee
in
countenance
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
set
the
ill
-
natured
girl
in
tears
and
fretfulness
;
all
her
old
temper
came
upon
her
,
as
I
designed
it
should
,
for
she
had
kept
me
at
bay
longer
than
usual
;
and
I
left
her
under
the
dominion
of
it
,
and
because
I
would
not
come
into
fresh
dispute
,
got
my
mamma
's
leave
,
and
went
in
the
chariot
,
to
beg
a
dinner
at
Lady
Jones
's
;
and
then
came
home
as
cool
and
as
easy
as
I
used
to
be
;
and
found
Nancy
as
sullen
and
silent
,
as
was
her
custom
,
before
Mr.
Murray
tendered
himself
to
her
ready
acceptance
.
<EOS>
But
I
went
to
my
spinnet
,
and
suffered
her
to
swell
on
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
said
nothing
but
<EOS>
No
<EOS>
and
Yes
ever
since
<EOS>
;
and
I
wish
I
was
with
you
for
a
month
,
and
all
their
nonsense
over
without
me
.

I
am

From
Miss
Darnford
to
Mrs.
B.
  
MY
DEAR
MRS
.
<EOS>
B.
,
  
Pray
give
my
service
to
your
Mr.
B.
and
tell
him
he
is
very
impolite
in
his
reflections
upon
me
,
as
to
Mr.
Murray
,
when
he
supposes
I
regret
the
loss
of
him
.
<EOS>
You
are
much
more
favourable
and
just
too
,
I
will
say
,
to
your
Polly
Damford
.
<EOS>
These
gentlemen
,
the
very
best
of
them
,
are
such
indelicates
!
<EOS>
They
think
so
highly
of
their
saucy
selves
,
and
confident
sex
,
as
if
a
lady
can
not
from
her
heart
despise
them
;
but
if
she
turns
them
off
,
as
they
deserve
,
and
continues
her
dislike
,
what
should
be
interpreted
in
her
favour
,
as
a
just
and
regular
conduct
,
is
turned
against
her
,
and
it
must
proceed
from
spite
.
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
may
think
he
knows
much
of
the
sex
.
<EOS>
But
were
I
as
malicious
as
he
is
reflecting
(
and
yet
,
if
I
have
any
malice
,
he
has
raised
it
)
,
I
could
say
,
that
his
acquaintance
,
was
not
with
the
most
unexceptionable
,
till
he
knew
you
:
and
he
has
not
long
enough
been
happy
in
you
<EOS>
,
I
find
,
to
do
justice
to
those
who
are
proud
to
emulate
your
virtues
.
  
<EOS>
I
say
,
Mrs.
B.
,
there
can
be
no
living
with
these
men
upon
such
beginnings
.
<EOS>
They
ought
to
know
their
distance
,
or
be
taught
it
,
and
not
to
think
it
in
their
power
to
confer
that
as
a
favour
,
which
they
should
esteem
it
an
honour
to
receive
.
  
<EOS>
But
neither
can
I
bear
,
it
seems
,
the
preparatives
to
matrimony
,
the
fine
clothes
,
the
compliments
,
the
busy
novelty
,
as
he
calls
it
,
the
new
equipages
,
and
so
forth
.
  
<EOS>
That
's
his
mistake
again
,
tell
him
:
for
one
who
can
look
forwarder
than
the
nine
days
of
wonder
,
can
easily
despise
so
flashy
and
so
transient
a
glare
.
<EOS>
And
were
I
fond
of
compliments
,
it
would
not
,
perhaps
,
be
the
way
to
be
pleased
,
in
that
respect
,
if
I
were
to
marry
.
  
<EOS>
Compliments
in
the
single
state
are
a
lady
's
due
,
whether
courted
or
not
;
and
she
receives
,
or
ought
always
to
receive
them
,
as
such
;
but
in
courtship
they
are
poured
out
upon
one
,
like
a
hasty
shower
,
soon
to
be
over
.
<EOS>
A
mighty
comfortable
consideration
this
,
to
a
lady
who
loves
to
be
complimented
!
<EOS>
Instead
of
the
refreshing
April
-
like
showers
,
which
beautify
the
sun
-
shine
,
she
shall
stand
a
deluge
of
complaisance
,
be
wet
to
the
skin
with
it
;
and
what
then
?
<EOS>
Why
be
in
a
Lybian
desert
ever
after
!
 
<EOS>
experience
a
constant
parching
drought
and
all
her
attributed
excellencies
will
be
swallowed
up
in
the
quicksands
of
matrimony
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
otherwise
with
you
;
and
it
must
be
so
;
because
there
is
such
an
infinite
variety
in
your
excellence
.
<EOS>
But
does
Mr.
B.
think
it
must
be
so
in
every
matrimony
?
  
<EOS>
@@@Tis
<EOS>
true
,
he
improves
every
hour
,
as
I
see
in
his
fine
speeches
to
you
.
<EOS>
But
it
could
not
be
Mr.
B.
if
he
did
not
:
your
merit
extorts
it
from
him
:
and
what
an
ungrateful
,
as
well
as
absurd
churl
,
would
he
be
,
who
should
seek
to
obscure
a
meridian
lustre
,
that
dazzles
the
eyes
of
every
one
else
?
  
<EOS>
I
thank
you
for
your
delightful
narratives
,
and
beg
you
to
continue
them
.
<EOS>
I
told
you
how
your
Saturday
's
conversation
with
Lady
Davers
,
and
your
Sunday
employments
,
charm
us
all
:
so
regular
,
and
so
easy
to
be
performed
 
<EOS>
That
's
the
delightful
thing
 
<EOS>
What
every
body
may
do;-and
yet
so
beautiful
,
so
laudable
,
so
uncommon
in
the
practice
,
especially
among
people
in
genteel
life
!
 
<EOS>
Your
conversation
and
decision
in
relation
to
the
two
parsons
(
more
than
charm
)
transport
us
.
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
judges
right
,
and
acts
a
charming
part
,
to
throw
such
a
fine
game
into
your
hands
.
<EOS>
And
so
excellently
do
you
play
it
,
that
you
do
as
much
credit
to
your
partner
's
judgment
as
to
your
own
.
<EOS>
Never
was
so
happy
a
couple
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Williams
is
more
my
favourite
than
ever
;
and
the
amply
rewarded
Mr.
Adams
,
how
did
that
scene
affect
us
!
<EOS>
Again
and
again
,
I
say
(
for
what
can
I
say
else
or
more
 
since
I
ca
n't
find
words
to
speak
all
I
think
?
)
,
you
're
a
charming
lady
!
<EOS>
Yet
,
methinks
,
poor
Mr.
H.
makes
but
a
sorry
figure
among
you
.
<EOS>
We
are
delighted
with
Lady
Davers
;
but
still
more
,
if
possible
,
with
the
countess
:
she
is
a
fine
lady
,
as
you
have
drawn
her
:
but
your
characters
,
though
truth
and
nature
,
are
the
most
shocking
,
or
the
most
amiable
,
that
I
ever
read
.
  
<EOS>
We
are
full
of
impatience
to
hear
of
the
arrival
of
Sir
Jacob
Swynford
.
<EOS>
We
know
his
character
pretty
well
:
<EOS>
but
when
he
has
sat
for
it
to
your
pencil
,
it
must
be
an
original
indeed
.
<EOS>
I
will
have
another
trial
with
my
papa
,
to
move
him
to
let
me
attend
you
.
<EOS>
I
am
rallying
my
forces
,
and
have
got
my
mamma
on
my
side
again
;
who
is
concerned
to
see
her
girl
vexed
and
insulted
by
her
younger
sister
;
and
who
yet
minds
no
more
what
she
says
to
her
,
than
what
I
say
;
and
Sir
Simon
loves
to
make
mischief
between
us
,
instead
of
interposing
to
silence
either
:
and
truly
,
I
am
afraid
his
delight
of
this
kind
will
make
him
deny
his
Polly
<EOS>
what
she
so
ardently
wishes
for
.
<EOS>
I
had
a
good
mind
to
be
sick
,
to
be
with
you
.
<EOS>
I
could
fast
two
or
three
days
,
to
give
it
the
better
appearance
;
but
then
my
mamma
,
who
loves
not
deceit
,
would
blame
me
,
if
she
knew
my
stratagem
;
and
be
grieved
,
if
she
thought
I
was
really
ill
.
<EOS>
I
know
,
fasting
,
<EOS>
when
one
has
a
stomach
to
eat
,
gives
one
a
very
gloomy
and
mortified
air
.
<EOS>
What
would
I
not
do
,
in
short
,
to
procure
to
myself
the
inexpressible
pleasure
that
I
should
have
in
your
company
and
conversation
?
<EOS>
But
continue
to
write
to
me
till
then
,
however
,
and
that
will
be
next
best
.
<EOS>
I
am
your
most
obliged
and
obedient
POLLY
DARNFORD
.
    
<EOS>
From
the
same
.
  
<EOS>
My
Dearest
Mrs.
B.
,
  
I
am
all
over
joy
and
rapture
.
<EOS>
My
good
papa
permits
me
to
say
,
that
he
will
put
his
Polly
under
your
protection
,
when
you
go
to
London
.
<EOS>
If
you
have
but
a
tenth
part
of
the
pleasure
I
have
on
this
occasion
,
I
am
sure
,
I
shall
be
as
welcome
as
I
wish
.
<EOS>
But
he
will
insist
upon
it
,
he
says
,
that
Mr.
B.
signs
some
acknowledgment
,
which
I
am
to
carry
along
with
me
,
that
I
am
intrusted
to
his
honour
and
yours
,
and
to
be
returned
to
him
heart
-
whole
and
dutiful
,
and
with
a
reputation
as
unsullied
as
he
receives
me
.
<EOS>
But
do
continue
your
journals
till
then
;
for
I
have
promised
to
take
them
up
where
you
leave
off
,
to
divert
our
friends
here
.
<EOS>
There
will
be
presumption
!
<EOS>
But
yet
I
will
write
nothing
but
what
I
will
shew
you
,
and
have
your
consent
to
send
!
<EOS>
For
I
was
taught
early
not
to
tell
tales
out
of
school
;
and
a
school
,
the
best
I
ever
went
to
,
will
be
your
charming
conversation
.
  
<EOS>
We
were
greatly
diverted
with
the
trick
put
upon
that
barbarian
Sir
Jacob
.
<EOS>
His
obstinacy
,
repentance
,
and
amendment
,
followed
so
irresistibly
in
one
half
hour
,
from
the
happy
thought
of
the
excellent
lady
countess
,
that
I
think
no
plot
was
ever
more
fortunate
.
<EOS>
It
was
like
springing
a
lucky
mine
in
a
siege
,
that
blew
up
twenty
times
more
than
was
expected
from
it
,
and
answered
all
the
besiegers
'
ends
at
once
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
's
defence
of
his
own
conduct
towards
you
is
quite
noble
;
and
he
judges
with
his
usual
generosity
and
good
sense
,
when
,
by
adding
to
your
honour
,
he
knows
he
enhances
his
own
.
  
<EOS>
You
bid
me
skim
over
your
writings
lightly
;
but
'
tis
impossible
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
flatter
you
,
my
dear
Mrs.
B.
,
nor
will
I
be
suspected
to
do
so
;
and
yet
I
can
not
find
words
to
praise
,
so
much
as
I
think
you
deserve
:
<EOS>
so
I
will
only
say
that
your
good
parents
,
for
whose
pleasure
you
write
,
as
well
as
for
mine
,
can
not
receive
or
read
them
with
more
delight
than
I
do
.
<EOS>
Even
my
sister
Nancy
(
judge
of
their
effect
by
this
!
)
<EOS>
will
at
any
time
leave
Murray
,
and
forget
to
frown
or
be
ill
-
natured
,
while
she
can
hear
read
what
you
write
.
<EOS>
And
,
angry
as
she
makes
me
some
times
,
I
can
not
deny
her
this
pleasure
,
because
possibly
,
among
the
innumerable
improving
reflections
they
abound
with
,
some
one
may
possibly
dart
in
upon
her
,
and
illuminate
her
,
as
your
conversation
and
behaviour
did
Sir
Jacob
.
  
<EOS>
But
your
application
in
P.S.
to
my
papa
pleased
him
;
and
confirmed
his
resolution
to
let
me
go
.
<EOS>
He
snatched
the
sheet
that
contained
this
,
"
That
's
to
me
,
"
said
he
:
"
I
must
read
this
myself
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
did
,
and
said
,
"
She
's
a
sweet
one
:
"
Do
dear
good
Sir
Simon
,
"
repeated
he
aloud
,
"
"
let
Miss
Polly
add
to
our
delights
!
"
<EOS>
So
she
shall
,
then
;
 
if
that
will
do
it
!
 
<EOS>
And
yet
this
same
Mrs.
B.
has
so
many
delights
already
,
that
I
should
think
she
might
be
contented
.
<EOS>
But
,
Dame
Darnford
,
I
think
I
'll
let
her
go
.
<EOS>
These
sisters
then
,
you
'll
see
,
how
they
'll
love
at
a
distance
,
though
always
quarrelling
when
together
.
"
<EOS>
He
read
on
,
"
<EOS>
"
The
new
affair
will
divert
you
 
<EOS>
Lady
Darnford
has
consented
 
Miss
is
willing
;
and
her
sister
can
spare
her
;
"
 
Very
prettily
put
,
faith
"
And
do
n't
you
be
cross
"
 
<EOS>
V
ery
sweet
"
to
deny
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
Why
,
dear
Mrs.
B.
,
I
wo
n't
be
so
cross
then
;
indeed
I
wo
n't
!
 
<EOS>
And
so
,
Polly
,
let
'em
send
word
when
they
set
out
for
London
,
and
you
shall
join
'em
there
with
all
my
heart
;
but
I
'll
have
a
letter
every
post
,
remember
that
,
girl
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Any
thing
,
any
thing
,
dear
papa
,
"
said
I
:
"
<EOS>
so
I
can
but
go
!
"
<EOS>
He
called
for
a
kiss
,
for
his
compliance
.
<EOS>
I
gave
it
most
willingly
,
you
may
believe
.
  
<EOS>
Nancy
looked
envious
,
although
Mr.
Murray
came
in
just
then
.
<EOS>
She
looked
almost
like
a
great
glutton
,
whom
I
remember
;
one
Sir
Jonathan
Smith
,
who
killed
himself
with
eating
:
<EOS>
he
used
,
while
he
was
heaping
up
his
plate
from
one
dish
,
to
watch
the
others
,
and
follow
the
knife
of
every
body
else
with
such
a
greedy
eye
,
as
if
he
could
swear
a
robbery
against
any
one
who
presumed
to
eat
as
well
as
he
.
  
<EOS>
Well
,
let
's
know
when
you
set
out
,
and
you
sha
n't
have
been
a
week
in
London
,
if
I
can
help
it
,
but
you
shall
be
told
by
my
tongue
,
as
now
by
my
pen
,
how
much
I
am
your
obliged
admirer
and
friend
,
POLLY
DARNFORD
.
    
<EOS>
MY
DEAR
FRIEND
,
  
<EOS>
I
now
proceed
with
my
journal
,
which
I
had
brought
down
to
Thursday
night
.
  
<EOS>
FRIDAY
.
  
<EOS>
The
two
ladies
resolving
,
as
they
said
,
to
inspect
all
my
proceedings
,
insisted
upon
it
,
that
I
would
take
them
with
me
in
my
benevolent
round
(
as
they
,
after
we
returned
,
would
call
it
)
,
which
I
generally
take
once
a
week
,
among
my
poor
and
sick
neighbours
;
and
finding
I
could
not
get
off
,
I
set
out
with
them
,
my
lady
countess
proposing
Mrs.
Worden
to
fill
up
the
fourth
place
in
the
coach
.
<EOS>
We
talked
all
the
way
of
charity
,
and
the
excellence
of
that
duty
;
and
my
Lady
Davers
took
notice
of
the
text
,
that
it
would
hide
a
multitude
of
faults
.
  
<EOS>
The
countess
said
she
had
once
a
much
better
opinion
of
herself
,
than
she
found
she
had
reason
for
,
within
these
few
days
past
:
"
And
indeed
,
Mrs.
B.
,
"
said
she
,
"
when
I
get
home
,
I
shall
make
a
good
many
people
the
better
for
your
example
.
"
<EOS>
And
so
said
Lady
Davers
;
which
gave
me
no
small
inward
pleasure
;
and
<EOS>
I
acknowledged
,
in
suitable
terms
,
the
honour
they
both
did
me
.
<EOS>
The
coach
set
us
down
by
the
side
of
a
large
common
,
about
five
miles
distant
from
our
house
;
and
we
alighted
,
and
walked
a
little
way
,
choosing
not
to
have
the
coach
come
nearer
,
that
we
might
be
taken
as
little
notice
of
as
possible
;
and
they
entered
with
me
into
two
mean
cots
with
great
condescension
and
goodness
;
one
belonging
to
a
poor
widow
and
five
children
,
who
had
been
all
down
in
agues
and
fevers
;
the
other
to
a
man
and
his
wife
bed
-
rid
with
age
and
infirmities
,
and
two
honest
daughters
,
one
a
widow
with
two
children
,
the
other
married
to
an
husbandman
,
who
had
also
been
ill
,
but
now
,
by
comfortable
cordials
,
and
good
physic
,
were
pretty
well
to
what
they
had
been
.
  
<EOS>
The
two
ladies
were
well
pleased
with
my
demeanour
to
the
good
folks
:
to
whom
I
said
,
that
as
I
should
go
so
soon
to
London
,
I
was
willing
to
see
them
before
I
went
,
to
wish
them
better
and
better
,
and
to
tell
them
,
that
I
should
leave
orders
with
Mrs.
Jervis
concerning
them
,
to
whom
they
must
make
known
their
wants
:
and
that
Mr.
Barrow
would
take
care
of
them
,
I
was
sure
;
and
do
all
that
was
in
the
power
of
physic
for
the
restoration
of
their
healths
.
  
<EOS>
Now
you
must
know
,
Miss
,
that
I
am
not
so
good
as
the
old
ladies
of
former
days
,
who
used
to
distil
cordial
waters
,
and
prepare
medicines
,
and
dispense
them
themselves
.
<EOS>
I
knew
,
if
I
were
so
inclined
,
my
dear
Mr.
B.
would
not
have
been
pleased
with
it
,
because
in
the
approbation
he
has
kindly
given
to
my
present
method
,
he
has
twice
or
thrice
praised
me
,
that
I
do
n't
carry
my
charity
to
extremes
,
and
make
his
house
a
dispensatory
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
,
therefore
,
by
aiming
at
doing
too
much
,
lose
the
opportunity
of
doing
any
good
at
all
in
these
respects
;
and
besides
,
as
the
vulgar
saying
is
,
One
must
creep
before
one
goes
.
<EOS>
But
this
is
my
method
:
  
<EOS>
I
am
upon
an
agreement
with
this
Mr.
Barrow
,
who
is
deemed
a
very
skilful
and
honest
apothecary
,
and
one
Mr.
Simmonds
,
a
surgeon
of
like
character
,
to
attend
to
all
such
cases
and
persons
as
I
shall
recommend
;
Mr.
Barrow
,
to
administer
physic
and
cordials
,
as
he
shall
judge
proper
,
and
even
,
in
necessary
cases
,
to
call
in
a
physician
.
<EOS>
And
now
and
then
,
by
looking
in
upon
them
one
's
self
,
or
sending
a
servant
to
ask
questions
,
all
is
kept
right
.
  
<EOS>
My
Lady
Davers
observed
a
Bible
,
a
Common
Prayer
-
book
,
and
a
Whole
Duty
of
Man
,
in
each
cot
,
in
leathern
outside
cases
,
to
keep
them
clean
,
and
a
Church
Catechism
or
two
for
the
children
;
and
was
pleased
to
say
,
it
was
right
;
and
her
ladyship
asked
one
of
the
children
,
a
pretty
girl
,
who
learnt
her
her
catechism
?
<EOS>
And
she
curtsey'd
and
looked
at
me
;
for
I
do
ask
the
children
questions
,
when
I
come
,
to
know
how
they
improve
;
"
'
Tis
as
I
thought
,
"
said
my
lady
;
"
my
sister
provides
for
both
parts
.
<EOS>
God
bless
you
,
my
dear
!
"
<EOS>
said
she
,
and
tapped
my
neck
.
  
<EOS>
My
ladies
left
tokens
of
their
bounty
behind
them
to
both
families
,
and
all
the
good
folks
blessed
and
prayed
for
us
at
parting
:
and
as
we
went
out
,
my
Lady
Davers
,
with
a
serious
air
,
was
pleased
to
say
to
me
,
"
Take
care
of
your
health
,
my
dear
sister
;
and
God
give
you
,
when
it
comes
,
a
happy
hour
:
<EOS>
for
how
many
real
mourners
would
you
have
,
if
you
were
to
be
called
early
to
reap
the
fruits
of
your
piety
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
God
's
will
must
be
done
,
my
lady
,
"
said
I.
"
<EOS>
The
same
Providence
that
has
so
wonderfully
put
it
in
my
power
to
do
a
little
good
,
will
raise
up
new
friends
to
the
honest
hearts
that
rely
upon
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
This
I
said
,
because
some
of
the
good
people
heard
my
lady
,
and
seemed
troubled
,
and
began
to
redouble
their
prayers
,
for
my
safety
and
preservation
.
  
<EOS>
We
walked
thence
to
our
coach
,
and
stretched
a
little
farther
,
to
visit
two
farmers
'
families
,
about
a
mile
distant
from
each
other
.
<EOS>
One
had
the
mother
of
the
family
,
with
two
sons
,
just
recovering
,
the
former
from
a
fever
,
the
latter
from
tertian
agues
;
and
I
asked
,
when
they
saw
Mr.
Barrow
?
<EOS>
They
told
me
,
with
great
commendations
of
him
,
that
he
had
but
just
left
them
.
<EOS>
So
,
having
congratulated
their
hopeful
way
,
and
wished
them
to
take
care
of
themselves
,
and
not
go
too
early
to
business
,
I
said
I
should
desire
Mr.
Barrow
to
watch
over
them
,
for
fear
of
a
relapse
,
and
should
hardly
see
'em
again
for
some
time
;
and
so
I
slid
,
in
a
manner
not
to
be
observed
,
a
couple
of
guineas
into
the
good
woman
's
hand
;
for
I
had
a
hint
given
me
by
Mrs.
Jervis
,
that
their
illness
had
made
it
low
with
them
.
  
<EOS>
We
proceeded
then
to
the
other
farm
,
where
the
case
was
a
married
daughter
,
who
had
a
very
dangerous
lying
-
in
,
and
a
wicked
husband
who
had
abused
her
,
and
run
away
from
her
;
but
she
was
mending
apace
,
by
good
comfortable
things
,
which
from
time
to
time
I
had
caused
to
be
sent
her
.
<EOS>
Her
old
father
had
been
a
little
unkind
to
her
,
before
I
took
notice
of
her
;
for
she
married
against
his
consent
;
and
indeed
the
world
went
hard
with
the
poor
man
,
and
he
could
not
do
much
;
and
besides
,
he
had
a
younger
daughter
,
who
had
lost
all
her
limbs
,
and
was
forced
to
be
tied
in
a
wicker
chair
,
to
keep
her
up
in
it
;
which
(
having
expended
much
to
relieve
her
)
was
a
great
pull
-
back
,
as
the
good
old
woman
called
it
.
<EOS>
And
having
been
a
year
in
arrear
to
a
harsh
landlord
,
who
,
finding
a
good
stock
upon
the
ground
,
threatened
to
distress
the
poor
family
,
and
turn
them
out
of
all
,
I
advanced
the
money
upon
the
stock
;
and
the
poor
man
has
already
paid
me
half
of
it
(
for
,
Miss
<EOS>
,
I
must
keep
within
compass
too
)
,
which
was
fifty
pounds
at
first
,
and
is
in
a
fair
way
to
pay
me
the
other
half
,
and
make
as
much
more
for
himself
.
  
<EOS>
Here
I
found
Mr.
Barrow
,
and
he
gave
me
an
account
of
the
success
of
two
other
cases
I
had
recommended
to
him
;
and
told
me
,
that
John
Smith
,
a
poor
man
,
who
,
in
thatching
a
barn
,
had
tumbled
down
,
and
broken
his
leg
,
and
bruised
himself
all
over
,
was
in
a
fair
way
of
recovery
.
<EOS>
This
poor
creature
had
like
to
have
perished
by
the
cruelty
of
the
parish
officers
,
who
would
have
passed
him
away
to
Essex
,
where
his
settlement
was
,
though
in
a
burning
fever
,
occasioned
by
his
misfortune
;
but
hearing
of
the
case
,
I
directed
Mr.
Simmonds
to
attend
him
,
and
to
provide
for
him
at
my
expense
,
and
gave
my
word
,
if
he
died
,
to
bury
him
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
glad
to
hear
he
was
in
so
good
a
way
,
and
told
Mr.
Barrow
,
I
hoped
to
see
him
and
Mr.
Simmonds
together
at
Mr.
B.
's
,
before
I
set
out
for
London
,
that
we
might
advise
about
the
cases
under
their
direction
,
and
that
I
might
acquit
myself
of
some
of
my
obligations
to
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
a
good
man
,
Mr.
Barrow
,
"
added
I
:
"
God
will
bless
you
for
your
care
and
kindness
to
these
poor
destitute
creatures
.
<EOS>
They
all
praise
you
,
and
do
nothing
but
talk
of
your
humanity
to
them
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
O
my
good
lady
,
"
said
he
,
"
who
can
forbear
following
such
an
example
as
you
set
?
<EOS>
Mr.
Simmonds
can
testify
as
well
as
I
(
for
now
<EOS>
and
then
a
case
requires
us
to
visit
together
)
that
we
can
hardly
hear
any
complaints
from
our
poor
patients
,
let
'em
be
ever
so
ill
,
for
the
praises
and
blessings
they
bestow
upon
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
good
Mr.
B.
that
enables
and
encourages
me
to
do
what
I
do
.
<EOS>
Tell
them
,
they
must
bless
God
,
and
bless
him
,
and
pray
for
me
,
and
thank
you
and
Mr.
Simmonds
:
we
all
join
together
,
you
know
,
for
their
good
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
countess
and
Lady
Davers
asked
the
poor
lying
-
in
woman
many
questions
,
and
left
with
her
,
and
for
her
poor
sister
,
a
miserable
object
indeed
!
 
<EOS>
(
God
be
praised
that
I
am
not
such
an
one
!
)
<EOS>
marks
of
their
bounty
in
gold
,
and
looking
upon
one
another
,
and
then
upon
me
,
and
<EOS>
lifting
up
their
hands
,
could
not
say
a
word
till
we
were
in
the
coach
:
and
so
we
were
carried
home
,
after
we
had
just
looked
in
upon
a
country
school
,
where
I
pay
for
the
learning
of
eight
children
.
<EOS>
And
here
(
I
hope
I
recite
not
this
with
pride
,
though
I
do
with
pleasure
)
is
a
cursory
account
of
my
benevolent
weekly
round
,
as
my
ladies
will
call
it
.
<EOS>
I
know
you
will
not
be
displeased
with
it
;
but
it
will
highly
delight
my
worthy
parents
,
who
,
in
their
way
,
do
a
great
deal
of
discreet
good
in
their
neighbourhood
:
for
indeed
,
Miss
,
a
little
matter
,
prudently
bestowed
,
and
on
true
objects
of
compassion
(
whose
cases
are
soon
at
a
crisis
,
as
are
those
of
most
labouring
people
)
,
will
go
a
great
way
,
and
especially
if
laid
out
properly
for
'em
,
according
to
the
exigencies
of
their
respective
cases
.
 
<EOS>
For
such
poor
people
,
who
live
generally
low
,
want
very
seldom
any
thing
but
reviving
cordials
at
first
,
and
good
wholesome
kitchen
physic
afterwards
:
and
then
the
wheels
of
nature
,
being
unclogged
<EOS>
,
new
oiled
,
as
it
were
,
and
set
right
,
they
will
go
round
again
with
pleasantness
and
ease
for
a
good
while
together
,
by
virtue
of
that
exercise
which
their
labour
gives
them
;
while
the
rich
and
voluptuous
are
forced
to
undergo
great
fatigues
to
keep
theirs
clean
and
in
order
.
  
<EOS>
SATURDAY
MORNING
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
hardly
right
to
trouble
either
of
you
,
my
honoured
correspondents
,
with
an
affair
that
has
vexed
me
a
good
deal
;
and
,
indeed
,
should
affect
me
more
than
any
other
mistress
of
a
family
,
for
reasons
which
will
be
obvious
to
you
,
when
I
tell
you
the
case
.
<EOS>
And
this
I
can
not
forbear
doing
.
  
<EOS>
A
pretty
genteel
young
body
,
my
Polly
Barlow
,
as
I
call
her
,
having
been
well
recommended
,
and
behaved
with
great
prudence
till
this
time
,
is
the
cause
.
  
<EOS>
My
dear
Mr.
B.
and
the
two
ladies
,
agreed
with
me
to
take
a
little
airing
in
the
coach
,
and
to
call
in
upon
Mr.
Martin
,
who
had
a
present
made
him
for
his
menagerie
,
in
which
he
takes
a
great
delight
,
of
a
rare
and
uncommon
creature
,
a
native
of
the
East
Indies
.
<EOS>
But
just
as
Sir
Jacob
was
on
horseback
to
accompany
them
,
and
the
ladies
were
ready
to
go
,
I
was
taken
with
a
sudden
disorder
and
faintishness
;
so
that
Lady
Davers
,
who
is
very
tender
of
me
,
and
watches
every
change
of
my
countenance
,
would
not
let
me
go
with
them
,
though
my
disorder
was
going
off
:
and
<EOS>
my
dear
Mr.
B.
was
pleased
to
excuse
me
;
and
just
meeting
with
Mr.
Williams
,
as
they
went
to
the
coach
,
they
took
him
with
them
,
to
fill
up
the
vacant
place
.
<EOS>
So
I
retired
to
my
closet
,
and
shut
myself
in
.
  
<EOS>
They
had
asked
Mr.
H.
to
go
with
them
,
for
company
to
Sir
Jacob
;
but
he
(
on
purpose
,
as
I
believe
by
what
followed
)
could
not
be
found
,
when
they
set
out
:
so
they
supposed
he
was
upon
some
ramble
with
Mr.
Colbrand
,
his
great
favourite
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
writing
to
you
,
being
pretty
well
recovered
,
when
I
heard
Polly
,
as
I
supposed
,
and
as
it
proved
,
come
into
my
apartment
:
<EOS>
and
down
she
sat
,
and
sung
a
little
catch
,
and
cried
,
"
Hem
!
"
<EOS>
twice
;
and
presently
I
heard
two
voices
.
<EOS>
But
suspecting
nothing
,
I
wrote
on
,
till
I
heard
a
kind
of
rustling
and
struggling
,
and
Polly
's
voice
crying
,
"
Fie
 
<EOS>
How
can
you
do
so
!
 
<EOS>
Pray
,
Sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
alarmed
me
much
,
because
we
have
such
orderly
folks
about
us
;
and
I
looked
through
the
key
-
hole
;
and
,
to
my
surprise
and
concern
,
saw
Mr.
H.
 
foolish
gentleman
!
 
<EOS>
taking
liberties
with
Polly
,
that
neither
became
him
to
offer
,
nor
,
more
foolish
girl
!
<EOS>
her
to
suffer
.
<EOS>
And
having
reason
to
think
,
that
this
was
not
their
first
interview
,
and
freedom
 
and
the
girl
sometimes
encouragingly
laughing
,
as
at
other
times
,
inconsistently
,
struggling
and
complaining
,
in
an
accent
that
was
too
tender
for
the
occasion
,
I
forced
a
faint
cough
.
<EOS>
This
frighted
them
both
:
Mr.
H.
swore
,
and
said
,
"
Who
can
that
be
?
 
<EOS>
Your
lady
's
gone
with
them
,
is
n't
she
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
so
!
 
<EOS>
I
hope
so
!
"
said
the
silly
girl
 
"
yet
that
was
like
her
voice
!
 
<EOS>
Me'm
,
are
you
in
your
closet
,
Me'm
?
"
<EOS>
said
she
,
coming
up
to
the
door
;
Mr.
H.
standing
like
a
poor
thief
,
half
behind
the
window
-
curtains
,
till
he
knew
whether
it
was
I.
  
<EOS>
I
opened
the
door
:
away
sneaked
Mr.
H.
,
and
she
leaped
with
surprise
,
not
hoping
to
find
me
there
,
though
she
asked
the
question
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
thought
 
<EOS>
Indeed
 
<EOS>
Me'm
 
<EOS>
I
thought
you
were
gone
out
,
"
 
"
It
is
plain
you
did
,
Polly
.
 
<EOS>
Go
and
shut
the
chamber
door
,
and
come
to
me
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
did
,
but
trembled
,
and
was
so
full
of
confusion
,
that
I
pitied
the
poor
creature
,
and
hardly
knew
how
to
speak
to
her
.
<EOS>
For
my
compassion
got
the
upper
hand
of
my
resentment
;
and
as
she
stood
quaking
and
trembling
,
and
looking
on
the
ground
with
a
countenance
I
can
not
describe
,
I
now
and
then
cast
my
eye
upon
her
,
and
was
as
often
forced
to
put
my
handkerchief
to
it
.
  
<EOS>
At
last
I
said
,
"
How
long
have
these
freedoms
past
between
you
and
Mr.
H.
?
 
<EOS>
I
am
loth
to
be
censorious
,
Polly
;
but
it
is
too
plain
,
that
Mr.
H.
would
not
have
followed
you
into
my
chamber
,
if
he
had
not
met
you
at
other
places
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
The
poor
girl
said
never
a
word
.
 
<EOS>
"
Little
did
I
expect
,
Polly
,
that
you
would
have
shewn
so
much
imprudence
.
<EOS>
You
have
had
instances
of
the
vile
arts
of
men
against
poor
maidens
:
have
you
any
notion
that
Mr.
H.
intends
to
do
honourably
by
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Me'm
 
<EOS>
Me'm
 
<EOS>
I
believe
 
<EOS>
I
hope
 
<EOS>
I
dare
say
,
Mr.
H.
would
not
do
otherwise
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
So
much
the
worse
that
you
believe
so
,
if
you
have
not
very
good
reason
for
your
belief
.
<EOS>
Does
he
pretend
that
he
will
marry
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
She
was
silent
.
 
<EOS>
"
Tell
me
,
Polly
,
if
he
does
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
says
he
will
do
honourably
by
me
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
you
know
there
is
but
one
word
necessary
to
explain
that
other
precious
word
honour
,
in
this
case
.
<EOS>
It
is
matrimony
.
<EOS>
That
word
is
as
soon
spoken
as
any
other
,
and
if
he
means
it
,
he
will
not
be
shy
to
speak
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
She
was
silent
.
  
<EOS>
"
Tell
me
,
Polly
(
for
I
am
really
greatly
concerned
for
you
)
,
<EOS>
what
you
think
yourself
;
do
you
hope
he
will
marry
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
She
was
silent
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
,
good
Polly
(
I
hope
I
may
call
you
good
yet
!
)
,
answer
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Pray
,
Madam
!
"
<EOS>
and
she
wept
,
and
turned
from
me
,
to
the
wainscot
 
"
Pray
,
excuse
me
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
,
indeed
,
Polly
,
I
can
not
excuse
you
.
<EOS>
You
are
under
my
protection
.
<EOS>
I
was
once
in
as
dangerous
a
situation
as
you
can
be
in
.
<EOS>
And
I
did
not
escape
it
,
child
,
by
the
language
and
conduct
<EOS>
I
heard
from
you
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Language
and
conduct
,
Me'm
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Polly
,
language
and
conduct
.
<EOS>
Do
you
think
,
if
I
had
set
me
down
in
my
lady
's
bed
-
chamber
,
sung
a
song
,
and
hemm'd
twice
,
and
Mr.
B.
coming
to
me
,
upon
that
signal
(
for
such
<EOS>
I
doubt
it
was
)
,
I
had
kept
my
place
,
and
suffered
myself
to
be
rumpled
,
and
only
,
in
a
soft
voice
,
and
with
an
encouraging
laugh
,
cried
"
How
can
you
do
so
?
"
<EOS>
that
I
should
have
been
what
I
am
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Me'm
,
I
dare
say
,
my
lord
"
(
so
all
the
servants
call
him
,
and
his
aunt
often
,
when
she
puts
Jackey
to
it
)
,
"
means
no
hurt
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
hurt
,
Polly
!
<EOS>
What
,
and
make
you
cry
"
Fie
!
"
 
<EOS>
or
do
you
intend
to
trust
your
honour
to
his
mercy
,
rather
than
to
your
own
discretion
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
hope
not
,
Me'm
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
hope
not
too
,
Polly
!
 
<EOS>
But
you
know
he
was
free
enough
with
you
,
to
make
you
say
"
Fie
!
"
<EOS>
And
what
might
have
been
the
case
,
who
knows
?
<EOS>
had
I
not
coughed
on
purpose
:
unwilling
,
for
your
sake
,
Polly
,
to
find
matters
so
bad
as
I
feared
,
and
that
you
would
have
been
led
beyond
what
was
reputable
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Reputable
,
Me'm
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Polly
:
I
am
sorry
you
oblige
me
to
speak
so
plain
.
<EOS>
But
your
good
requires
it
.
<EOS>
Instead
of
flying
from
him
,
you
not
only
laughed
when
you
cried
out
,
"
Fie
!
"
<EOS>
and
"
How
can
you
do
so
?
"
<EOS>
but
had
no
other
care
than
to
see
if
any
body
heard
you
;
and
you
observe
how
he
slid
away
,
like
a
guilty
creature
,
on
my
opening
the
door
 
<EOS>
Do
these
things
look
well
,
Polly
?
<EOS>
Do
you
think
they
do
?
 
<EOS>
And
if
you
hope
to
emulate
my
good
fortune
,
do
you
think
this
is
the
way
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
wish
,
Me'm
,
I
had
never
seen
Mr.
H.
<EOS>
For
nobody
will
look
upon
me
,
if
I
lose
your
favour
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
will
still
,
Polly
"
(
and
I
took
her
hand
,
with
a
kind
look
)
,
"
be
in
your
power
to
keep
it
:
<EOS>
I
will
not
mention
this
matter
,
if
you
make
me
your
friend
,
and
tell
me
all
that
has
passed
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Again
she
wept
,
and
was
silent
.
 
<EOS>
This
made
me
more
uneasy
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
think
,
Polly
,
"
said
I
,
"
that
I
would
envy
any
other
person
's
preferment
,
when
I
have
been
so
much
exalted
myself
.
<EOS>
If
Mr.
H.
has
talked
to
you
of
marriage
,
tell
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
Me'm
,
I
ca
n't
say
he
has
yet
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yet
,
Polly
!
<EOS>
Then
he
never
.
<EOS>
will
.
<EOS>
For
when
men
do
talk
of
it
,
they
do
n't
always
mean
it
:
<EOS>
but
whenever
they
mean
it
,
how
can
they
confirm
a
doubting
maiden
,
without
mentioning
it
:
but
alas
for
you
,
poor
Polly
!
 
<EOS>
The
freedoms
you
have
permitted
,
no
doubt
,
previous
to
those
I
heard
,
and
which
might
have
been
greater
,
<EOS>
had
I
not
surprised
you
with
my
cough
,
shew
too
well
,
that
he
need
not
make
any
promises
to
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Indeed
,
Me'm
,
"
said
she
,
sobbing
,
"
I
might
be
too
little
upon
my
guard
;
but
I
would
not
have
done
any
ill
for
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
would
not
,
Polly
;
but
if
you
suffer
these
freedoms
,
you
ca
n't
tell
what
you
'd
have
permitted
 
<EOS>
Tell
me
,
do
you
love
Mr.
H.
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
He
is
very
good
-
humoured
,
Madam
,
and
is
not
proud
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
'
tis
not
his
business
to
be
proud
,
when
he
hopes
to
humble
you
 
humble
you
,
indeed
!
 
<EOS>
beneath
the
lowest
person
of
the
sex
,
that
is
honest
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
hope
"
 
"
You
hope
!
"
<EOS>
interrupted
I.
<EOS>
"
You
hope
too
much
;
and
I
fear
a
great
deal
for
you
,
because
you
fear
so
little
for
yourself
.
 
<EOS>
But
say
,
how
often
have
you
been
in
private
together
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
In
private
,
Me'm
!
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
what
your
ladyship
calls
private
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Why
that
is
private
,
Polly
,
when
,
as
just
now
,
you
neither
imagined
nor
intended
any
body
should
see
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
was
silent
;
and
I
saw
by
this
,
poor
girl
,
how
true
lovers
are
to
their
secret
,
though
,
perhaps
,
their
ruin
depends
upon
keeping
it
.
<EOS>
But
it
behoved
me
,
on
many
accounts
,
to
examine
this
matter
narrowly
;
because
if
Mr.
H.
should
marry
her
,
it
would
have
been
laid
upon
Mr.
B.
's
example
.
 
<EOS>
And
if
Polly
were
ruined
,
it
would
be
a
sad
thing
,
and
people
would
have
said
,
"
Aye
,
she
could
take
care
enough
of
herself
,
but
none
at
all
of
her
servant
:
her
waiting
-
maid
had
a
much
more
remiss
mistress
than
Pamela
found
,
or
the
matter
would
not
have
been
thus
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Polly
,
I
see
,
"
continued
I
,
"
that
you
will
not
speak
out
to
me
.
<EOS>
You
may
have
several
reasons
for
it
,
possibly
,
though
not
one
good
one
.
<EOS>
But
as
soon
as
Lady
Davers
comes
in
,
who
has
a
great
concern
in
this
matter
,
as
well
as
Lord
Davers
,
and
are
answerable
to
Lord
H.
in
a
matter
of
so
much
importance
as
this
,
I
will
leave
it
to
her
ladyship
's
consideration
,
and
shall
no
more
concern
myself
to
ask
you
questions
about
it
 
<EOS>
For
then
I
must
take
her
ladyship
's
directions
,
and
part
with
you
,
to
be
sure
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
poor
girl
,
frighted
at
this
(
for
every
body
fears
Lady
Davers
)
,
wrung
her
hands
,
and
begged
,
for
God
's
sake
,
I
would
not
acquaint
Lady
Davers
with
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
how
can
I
help
it
?
 
<EOS>
Must
I
not
connive
at
your
proceedings
,
if
I
do
not
?
<EOS>
You
are
no
fool
,
Polly
,
in
other
cases
.
<EOS>
Tell
me
,
how
it
is
possible
for
me
,
in
my
situation
,
to
avoid
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
tell
your
ladyship
the
whole
truth
;
indeed
I
will
 
if
you
will
not
tell
Lady
Davers
.
<EOS>
I
am
ready
to
sink
at
the
thoughts
of
Lady
Davers
knowing
any
thing
of
this
.
"
  
<EOS>
This
looked
sadly
.
<EOS>
I
pitied
her
,
but
yet
was
angry
in
my
mind
;
for
I
saw
,
too
plainly
,
that
her
conduct
could
not
bear
a
scrutiny
,
not
even
in
_
<EOS>
her
own
_
opinion
,
poor
creature
.
  
<EOS>
I
said
,
"
Make
me
acquainted
with
the
whole
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Will
your
ladyship
promise
"
 
"
<EOS>
I
'll
promise
nothing
,
Polly
.
<EOS>
When
I
have
heard
all
you
think
proper
to
say
,
I
will
do
what
befits
me
to
do
;
but
with
as
much
tenderness
as
I
can
for
you
 
<EOS>
and
that
's
all
you
ought
to
expect
me
to
promise
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Why
then
,
Madam
 
<EOS>
But
how
can
I
speak
it
?
 
<EOS>
I
can
speak
sooner
to
any
body
,
than
to
Lady
Davers
and
you
,
Madam
:
for
her
ladyship
's
passion
,
and
your
ladyship
's
virtue
 
<EOS>
How
shall
I
?
"
 
<EOS>
And
then
she
threw
herself
at
my
feet
,
and
hid
her
face
with
her
apron
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
in
agonies
for
her
,
almost
;
I
wept
over
her
,
and
raised
her
up
,
and
said
,
"
Tell
me
all
.
<EOS>
You
can
not
tell
me
worse
than
I
apprehend
,
nor
I
hope
so
bad
!
<EOS>
O
Polly
,
tell
me
soon
.
 
<EOS>
For
you
give
me
great
pain
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
my
back
,
with
grief
and
compassion
for
the
poor
girl
,
was
ready
to
open
,
as
it
seemed
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
In
my
former
distresses
,
I
have
been
overcome
by
fainting
next
to
death
,
and
was
deprived
of
sense
for
some
moments
 
<EOS>
But
else
,
I
imagine
,
I
must
have
felt
some
such
affecting
sensation
,
as
the
unhappy
girl
's
case
gave
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
,
Madam
,
I
own
,
"
said
she
,
"
I
have
been
too
faulty
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
As
how
?
 
<EOS>
As
what
?
 
<EOS>
In
what
way
?
 
<EOS>
How
faulty
?
"
 
<EOS>
asked
I
,
as
quick
as
thought
:
"
you
are
not
ruined
,
are
you
?
 
<EOS>
Tell
me
,
Polly
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
Madam
,
but
"
 
"
But
what
?
 
<EOS>
Say
,
but
what
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
had
consented
"
 
"
<EOS>
To
what
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
To
his
proposals
,
Madam
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
proposals
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
Madam
,
I
was
to
live
with
Mr.
H.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
understand
you
too
well
 
<EOS>
But
is
it
too
late
to
break
so
wretched
a
bargain
;
 
have
you
already
made
a
sacrifice
of
your
honour
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
Madam
:
<EOS>
but
I
have
given
it
under
my
hand
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Under
your
hand
!
 
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
Polly
,
it
is
well
if
you
have
not
given
it
under
your
heart
too
.
<EOS>
But
what
foolishness
is
this
!
 
<EOS>
What
consideration
has
he
made
you
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
has
given
it
under
his
hand
,
that
he
will
always
love
me
;
and
when
his
lordship
's
father
dies
,
he
will
own
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
foolishness
is
this
on
both
sides
!
 
<EOS>
But
are
you
willing
to
be
released
from
this
bargain
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
I
am
.
<EOS>
Madam
,
and
I
told
him
so
yesterday
.
<EOS>
But
he
says
he
will
sue
me
,
and
ruin
me
,
if
I
do
n't
stand
to
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
ruined
if
you
do
!
 
<EOS>
And
I
wish
 
<EOS>
But
tell
me
,
Polly
,
are
you
not
ruined
as
it
is
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
I
am
not
,
Madam
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
doubt
,
then
,
you
were
upon
the
brink
of
it
,
had
not
this
providential
indisposition
kept
me
at
home
.
 
<EOS>
You
met
,
I
suppose
,
to
conclude
your
shocking
bargain
.
 
<EOS>
O
poor
unhappy
girl
!
 
<EOS>
But
let
me
see
what
he
has
given
under
his
hand
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
has
'em
both
,
Madam
,
to
be
drawn
up
fair
,
and
in
a
strong
hand
,
that
shall
be
like
a
record
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Could
I
have
thought
,
Miss
,
that
a
girl
of
nineteen
could
be
so
ignorant
in
a
point
so
important
,
when
in
every
thing
else
she
has
shewn
no
instances
like
this
stupid
folly
?
  
<EOS>
"
Has
he
given
you
money
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Madam
,
he
gave
me
 
he
gave
me
 
a
note
.
<EOS>
Here
it
is
.
<EOS>
He
says
any
body
will
give
me
money
for
it
.
"
<EOS>
And
this
was
a
bank
note
of
fifty
pounds
,
which
she
pulled
out
of
her
stays
.
  
<EOS>
The
result
was
,
he
was
to
settle
one
hundred
pounds
a
year
upon
her
and
hers
,
poor
,
poor
girl
 
and
was
to
own
her
,
as
he
calls
it
(
but
as
wife
or
mistress
,
she
stipulated
not
)
,
when
his
father
died
,
and
he
came
into
the
title
and
estate
.
  
<EOS>
I
told
her
,
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
conceal
the
matter
from
Lady
Davers
,
if
she
would
not
,
by
her
promises
to
be
governed
entirely
by
me
,
and
to
abandon
all
thoughts
of
Mr.
H.
,
give
me
room
to
conclude
,
that
the
wicked
bargain
was
at
an
end
.
  
<EOS>
And
to
keep
the
poor
creature
in
some
spirits
,
and
to
enable
her
to
look
up
,
and
to
be
more
easy
under
my
direction
,
I
blamed
him
more
than
I
did
her
:
<EOS>
though
,
considering
what
virtue
requires
of
a
woman
,
and
custom
has
made
shameless
in
a
man
,
I
think
the
poor
girl
inexcusable
,
and
shall
not
be
easy
while
she
is
about
me
.
<EOS>
For
she
is
more
to
blame
,
because
,
of
the
two
,
she
has
more
wit
than
the
man
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
what
can
I
do
?
"
thought
I.
"
<EOS>
If
I
put
her
away
,
'
twill
be
to
throw
her
directly
into
his
hands
.
<EOS>
He
wo
n't
stay
here
long
:
and
she
may
see
her
folly
.
<EOS>
But
yet
her
eyes
were
open
;
she
knew
what
she
had
to
trust
to
 
and
by
their
wicked
beginning
,
and
her
encouraging
repulses
,
I
doubt
she
would
have
been
utterly
ruined
that
very
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
knew
the
rage
Lady
Davers
would
be
in
with
both
.
<EOS>
So
this
was
another
embarrassment
.
<EOS>
Yet
should
my
good
intentions
fail
,
and
they
conclude
their
vile
bargain
,
and
it
appeared
that
I
knew
of
it
,
but
would
not
acquaint
her
,
then
should
I
have
been
more
blamed
than
any
mistress
of
a
family
,
circumstanced
as
I
am
.
<EOS>
Upon
the
whole
,
I
resolved
to
comfort
the
girl
as
well
as
I
could
,
till
I
had
gained
her
confidence
,
that
my
advice
might
have
the
more
weight
,
and
,
by
degrees
,
be
more
likely
to
reclaim
her
:
for
,
poor
soul
!
<EOS>
there
would
be
an
end
of
her
reputation
,
the
most
precious
of
all
jewels
,
the
moment
the
matter
was
known
;
and
that
would
be
a
sad
thing
.
  
<EOS>
As
for
the
man
,
I
thought
it
best
to
take
courage
(
and
you
,
that
know
me
,
will
say
,
I
must
have
a
good
deal
more
than
usual
)
to
talk
to
Mr.
H.
on
this
subject
.
<EOS>
And
she
consenting
I
should
,
and
,
with
great
protestations
,
declaring
her
sorrow
and
repentance
,
begging
to
get
her
note
of
hand
again
,
and
to
give
him
back
his
note
of
fifty
pounds
<EOS>
,
I
went
down
to
find
him
.
  
<EOS>
He
shunned
me
,
as
a
thief
would
a
constable
at
the
head
of
a
hue
-
and
-
cry
.
<EOS>
As
I
entered
one
room
,
he
went
into
another
,
looking
with
conscious
guilt
,
yet
confidently
humming
a
tune
.
<EOS>
At
last
I
fixed
him
,
bidding
Rachel
tell
<EOS>
Polly
be
wanted
to
send
a
message
by
her
to
her
lady
.
<EOS>
By
which
I
doubted
not
he
was
desirous
to
know
what
she
had
owned
,
in
order
to
govern
himself
accordingly
.
  
<EOS>
His
back
was
towards
me
;
and
I
said
   
"
Mr.
H.
,
here
I
am
myself
,
to
take
your
commands
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
gave
a
caper
half
a
yard
high
 
<EOS>
"
Madam
,
I
wanted
 
I
wanted
to
speak
to
 
<EOS>
I
would
have
spoken
with
"
  
"
You
wanted
to
send
Polly
to
me
,
perhaps
,
Mr.
H.
,
to
ask
if
I
would
take
a
little
walk
with
you
in
the
garden
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Very
true
,
Madam
!
 
<EOS>
Very
true
indeed
!
 
<EOS>
You
have
guessed
the
matter
.
<EOS>
I
thought
it
was
pity
,
this
fine
day
,
as
every
body
was
taking
airing
"
  
"
<EOS>
Well
then
.
<EOS>
Sir
,
please
to
lead
the
way
,
and
I
'll
attend
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yet
I
fancy
,
Madam
,
the
wind
is
a
little
too
high
for
you
.
 
<EOS>
Wo
n't
you
catch
cold
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
never
fear
,
Mr.
H.
,
I
am
not
afraid
of
a
little
air
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
attend
you
presently
,
Madam
:
<EOS>
you
'll
be
in
the
great
gravel
walk
,
or
on
the
terrace
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
wait
upon
you
in
an
instant
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
had
the
courage
to
take
hold
of
his
arm
,
as
if
I
had
like
to
have
slipt
.
 
<EOS>
For
<EOS>
,
thought
I
,
thou
shalt
not
see
the
girl
till
I
have
talked
to
thee
a
little
,
if
thou
dost
then
.
 
<EOS>
"
Excuse
me
,
Mr.
H.
 
I
hope
I
have
not
hurt
my
foot
 
<EOS>
I
must
lean
upon
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
be
pleased
,
Madam
,
to
have
a
chair
?
<EOS>
I
fear
you
have
sprained
your
foot
.
 
<EOS>
Shall
I
help
you
to
a
chair
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
No
,
no
,
Sir
,
I
shall
walk
it
off
,
if
I
hold
by
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
So
he
had
no
excuse
to
leave
me
,
and
we
proceeded
into
the
garden
.
<EOS>
But
never
did
any
thing
look
so
like
a
foolish
fellow
,
as
his
aunt
calls
him
.
<EOS>
He
looked
,
if
possible
,
half
a
dozen
ways
at
once
,
hemm'd
,
coughed
,
turned
his
head
behind
him
every
now
and
then
,
started
half
a
dozen
silly
subjects
,
in
hopes
to
hinder
me
from
speaking
.
  
<EOS>
I
appeared
,
I
believe
,
under
some
concern
how
to
begin
with
him
;
for
he
would
have
it
<EOS>
I
was
not
very
well
,
and
begged
he
might
step
in
one
minute
to
desire
Mrs.
Jervis
to
attend
me
.
  
<EOS>
So
I
resolved
to
begin
with
him
;
lest
I
should
lose
the
opportunity
,
seeing
my
eel
so
very
slippery
.
<EOS>
And
placing
myself
on
a
seat
,
asked
him
to
sit
down
.
<EOS>
He
declined
,
and
would
wait
upon
me
presently
,
he
said
,
and
seemed
to
be
going
.
<EOS>
So
I
began
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
easy
for
me
,
Mr.
H.
,
to
penetrate
into
the
reason
why
you
are
so
willing
to
leave
me
:
but
'
tis
for
your
own
sake
,
that
I
desire
you
to
hear
me
,
that
no
mischief
may
ensue
among
friends
and
relations
,
on
an
occasion
to
which
you
are
no
stranger
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
O
,
Madam
,
what
can
you
mean
?
<EOS>
Surely
,
Madam
,
you
do
n't
think
amiss
of
a
little
innocent
liberty
,
or
so
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
H.
,
"
replied
I
,
"
I
want
not
any
evidence
of
your
inhospitable
designs
upon
a
poor
unwary
young
creature
,
whom
your
birth
and
quality
have
found
it
too
easy
a
task
to
influence
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Inhospitable
designs
!
<EOS>
Madam
!
 
<EOS>
A
harsh
word
!
<EOS>
You
very
nice
ladies
can
not
admit
of
the
least
freedom
in
the
world
!
 
<EOS>
Why
,
Madam
,
I
have
kiss'd
a
lady
's
woman
before
now
,
in
a
civil
way
or
so
,
and
never
was
called
to
an
account
for
it
,
as
a
breach
of
hospitality
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Tis
not
for
me
,
Mr.
H.
,
to
proceed
to
_
very
nice
_
particulars
with
a
gentleman
who
can
act
as
you
have
done
,
by
a
poor
girl
,
that
dare
not
have
looked
up
to
a
man
of
your
quality
,
had
you
not
levelled
all
distinction
between
you
in
order
to
level
the
weak
creature
to
the
common
dirt
of
the
highway
.
<EOS>
I
must
say
,
that
the
poor
girl
heartily
repents
of
her
folly
;
and
,
to
shew
you
,
that
it
signifies
nothing
to
deny
it
<EOS>
,
she
begs
you
will
return
the
note
of
her
hand
you
extorted
from
her
foolishness
;
and
I
hope
you
'll
be
so
much
of
a
gentleman
,
as
not
to
keep
in
your
power
such
a
testimony
of
the
weakness
of
any
of
the
sex
.

Has
she
told
you
that
,
Madam
?
 
<EOS>
Why
,
may
be
 
indeed
 
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
<EOS>
but
say
 
Truly
,
it
may
n't
look
so
well
to
you
,
Madam
:
but
young
folks
will
have
frolics
.
<EOS>
It
was
nothing
but
a
frolic
.
<EOS>
Let
me
be
hanged
,
if
it
was
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Be
pleased
then
,
Sir
,
to
give
up
her
note
to
me
,
to
return
to
her

<EOS>
Reputation
should
not
be
frolicked
with
,
Sir

especially
that
of
a
poor
girl
,
who
has
nothing
else
to
depend
upon
.
<EOS>

<EOS>
"
I
'll
give
it
her
myself
,
if
you
please
,
Madam
,
and
laugh
at
her
into
the
bargain
.
<EOS>
Why
,
'
tis
comical
enough
,
if
the
little
pug
thought
I
was
earnest
,
I
must
have
a
laugh
or
two
at
her
,
Madam
,
when
I
give
it
her
up
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Since
,
'
tis
but
a
frolic
,
Mr.
H.
,
you
wo
n't
take
it
amiss
,
that
when
we
are
set
down
to
supper
,
we
call
Polly
in
,
and
demand
a
sight
of
her
note
,
and
that
will
make
every
one
merry
as
well
as
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
so
,
Madam
,
that
may
n't
be
so
well
neither
!
<EOS>
For
,
perhaps
,
they
will
be
apt
to
think
it
is
in
earnest
;
when
,
as
I
hope
to
live
,
'
tis
but
a
jest
:
<EOS>
nothing
in
the
world
else
,
upon
honour
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
put
on
then
a
still
more
serious
air
 
<EOS>
"
As
you
hope
to
live
,
say
you
,
Mr.
H.
!
 
<EOS>
and
upon
your
honour
!
<EOS>
How
!
<EOS>
fear
you
not
an
instant
punishment
for
this
appeal
?
<EOS>
And
what
is
the
honour
you
swear
by
?
<EOS>
Take
that
,
and
answer
me
,
Sir
:
<EOS>
do
gentlemen
give
away
bank
-
notes
for
frolics
,
and
for
mere
jests
,
and
nothing
in
the
world
else
!
 
<EOS>
I
am
sorry
to
be
obliged
to
deal
thus
with
you
.
<EOS>
But
I
thought
I
was
talking
to
a
gentleman
who
would
not
forfeit
his
veracity
;
and
that
in
so
solemn
an
instance
as
this
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
looked
like
a
man
thunderstruck
.
<EOS>
His
face
was
distorted
,
and
his
head
seemed
to
turn
about
upon
his
neck
,
like
a
weather
-
cock
in
a
hurricane
,
to
all
points
of
the
compass
;
his
hands
clenched
as
in
a
passion
,
and
yet
shame
and
confusion
struggling
in
every
limb
and
feature
.
<EOS>
At
last
he
said
,
"
I
am
confoundedly
betrayed
.
<EOS>
But
if
I
am
exposed
to
my
uncle
and
aunt
"
(
for
the
wretch
thought
of
nobody
but
himself
)
,
"
I
am
undone
,
and
shall
never
be
able
to
look
them
in
the
face
.
'
<EOS>
Tis
true
,
I
had
a
design
upon
her
;
and
since
she
has
betrayed
me
,
I
think
I
may
say
,
that
she
was
as
willing
,
almost
,
as
I.
"
  
"
Ungenerous
,
contemptible
wretch
!
"
<EOS>
thought
I
 
"
But
such
of
our
sex
as
can
thus
give
up
their
virtue
,
ought
to
expect
no
better
:
for
he
that
sticks
not
at
one
bad
action
,
will
not
scruple
at
another
to
vindicate
himself
:
and
so
,
devil
-
like
,
become
the
attempter
and
the
accuser
too
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
if
you
will
be
so
good
,
"
said
he
,
with
hands
uplifted
,
"
as
to
take
no
notice
of
this
to
my
uncle
,
and
especially
to
my
aunt
and
Mr.
B.
<EOS>
,
I
swear
to
you
,
I
never
will
think
of
her
as
long
as
I
live
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
'll
bind
this
promise
,
will
you
,
Sir
,
by
your
honour
,
and
as
you
hope
to
live
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
,
good
Madam
,
forgive
me
,
I
beseech
you
;
do
n't
be
so
severe
upon
me
.
<EOS>
By
all
that
's
"
  
"
Do
n't
swear
,
Mr.
H.
<EOS>
But
as
an
earnest
that
I
may
believe
you
,
give
me
back
the
girl
's
foolish
note
,
that
,
though
'
tis
of
no
significance
,
she
may
not
have
that
to
witness
her
folly
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
He
took
out
his
pocket
-
book
:
"
There
it
is
,
Madam
!
<EOS>
And
I
beg
you
'll
forgive
this
attempt
:
<EOS>
I
see
I
ought
not
to
have
made
it
.
<EOS>
I
doubt
it
was
a
breach
of
the
laws
of
hospitality
,
as
you
say
.
<EOS>
But
to
make
it
known
,
will
only
expose
me
,
and
it
can
do
no
good
;
and
Mr.
B.
will
perhaps
resent
it
;
and
my
aunt
will
never
let
me
hear
the
last
of
it
,
nor
my
uncle
<EOS>
neither
 
<EOS>
And
I
shall
be
sent
to
travel
again
 
And
"
(
added
the
poor
creature
)
"
<EOS>
I
was
once
in
a
storm
,
and
the
crossing
the
sea
again
would
be
death
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
a
wretch
art
thou
!
"
thought
I.
"
<EOS>
What
could
such
an
one
as
thou
find
to
say
,
to
a
poor
creature
that
,
if
put
in
the
scale
against
considerations
of
virtue
,
should
make
the
latter
kick
the
[
Transcriber

:

<EOS>
"
Poor
,
poor
Tony
Barrow
!
<EOS>
thou
art
sunk
indeed
!
<EOS>
Too
low
for
excuse
,
and
almost
beneath
pity
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
told
him
,
if
I
could
observe
that
nothing
passed
between
them
,
that
should
lay
me
under
a
necessity
of
revealing
the
matter
,
I
should
not
be
forward
to
expose
him
,
nor
the
maiden
either
:
but
that
he
must
,
in
his
own
judgment
,
excuse
me
,
if
I
made
every
body
acquainted
with
it
,
if
I
were
to
see
the
correspondence
between
them
likely
to
be
renewed
or
carried
on
:
"
For
,
"
added
I
,
"
in
that
case
I
should
owe
it
to
myself
,
to
Mr.
B.
,
to
Lord
and
Lady
Davers
,
and
to
you
,
and
the
unhappy
body
too
,
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
would
needs
drop
down
on
one
knee
,
to
promise
this
;
and
with
a
thousand
acknowledgments
,
left
me
to
find
Mr.
Colbrand
,
in
order
to
ride
to
meet
the
coach
on
its
return
.
<EOS>
I
went
in
,
and
gave
the
foolish
note
to
the
silly
girl
,
which
she
received
eagerly
,
and
immediately
burnt
;
and
I
told
her
,
I
would
not
suffer
her
to
come
near
me
but
as
little
as
possible
,
when
I
was
in
company
while
Mr.
H.
staid
;
but
consigned
her
entirely
to
the
care
of
Mrs.
Jervis
,
to
whom
only
,
I
said
,
I
would
hint
the
matter
as
tenderly
as
I
could
:
and
for
this
,
I
added
,
I
had
more
reasons
than
one
;
first
,
to
give
her
the
benefit
of
a
good
gentlewoman
's
advice
,
to
which
I
had
myself
formerly
been
beholden
,
and
from
whom
I
concealed
nothing
;
next
,
to
keep
out
of
Mr.
H.
's
way
;
and
lastly
that
I
might
have
an
opportunity
,
from
Mrs.
Jervis
's
opinion
,
to
judge
of
the
sincerity
of
her
repentance
:
<EOS>
"
For
,
Polly
,
"
said
I
,
"
you
must
imagine
,
so
regular
and
uniform
as
all
our
family
is
,
and
so
good
as
I
thought
all
the
people
about
me
were
,
that
I
could
not
suspect
,
that
she
,
the
duties
of
whose
place
made
her
nearest
to
my
person
,
was
the
farthest
from
what
I
wished
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
have
set
this
matter
so
strongly
before
her
,
and
Mrs.
Jervis
has
so
well
seconded
me
,
that
I
hope
the
best
;
for
the
grief
the
poor
creature
carries
in
her
looks
,
and
expresses
in
her
words
,
can
not
be
described
;
frequently
accusing
herself
,
with
tears
,
saying
often
to
Mrs.
Jervis
<EOS>
,
she
is
not
worthy
to
stand
in
the
presence
of
her
mistress
,
whose
example
she
has
made
so
bad
an
use
of
,
and
whose
lessons
she
had
so
ill
followed
.
  
<EOS>
I
am
sadly
troubled
at
this
matter
,
however
;
but
I
take
great
comfort
in
reflecting
that
my
sudden
indisposition
looked
like
a
providential
thing
,
which
may
save
one
poor
soul
,
and
be
a
seasonable
warning
to
her
,
as
long
as
she
lives
.
  
<EOS>
Meantime
I
must
observe
,
that
at
supper
last
night
,
Mr.
H.
looked
abject
and
mean
,
and
like
a
poor
thief
,
as
I
thought
,
and
conscious
of
his
disappointed
folly
(
though
I
seldom
glanced
my
eye
upon
him
)
,
had
less
to
say
for
himself
than
ever
.
  
<EOS>
And
once
my
Lady
Davers
,
laughing
,
said
,
"
I
think
in
my
heart
,
my
nephew
looks
more
foolish
every
time
I
see
him
,
than
the
last
.
"
<EOS>
He
stole
a
look
at
me
,
and
blushed
;
and
my
lord
said
,
"
Jackey
has
some
grace
!
<EOS>
He
blushes
!
<EOS>
Hold
up
thy
head
,
nephew
!
<EOS>
Hast
thou
nothing
at
all
to
say
for
thyself
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Sir
Jacob
said
,
"
A
blush
becomes
a
young
gentleman
!
<EOS>
I
never
saw
one
before
though
,
in
Mr.
H.
 
<EOS>
What
's
the
matter
,
Sir
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Only
,
"
said
Lady
Davers
,
"
his
skin
or
his
conscience
is
mended
,
that
's
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
Madam
,
"
was
all
he
said
,
bowing
to
his
aunt
,
and
affecting
a
careless
yet
confused
air
,
as
if
he
whispered
a
whistle
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
O
,
wretch
!
"
<EOS>
thought
I
,
"
see
what
it
is
to
have
a
condemning
conscience
;
while
every
innocent
person
looks
round
easy
,
smiling
,
and
erect
!
"
 
<EOS>
But
yet
it
was
not
the
shame
of
a
bad
action
,
I
doubt
,
but
being
discovered
and
disappointed
,
that
gave
him
his
confusion
of
face
.
  
<EOS>
What
a
sad
thing
for
a
person
to
be
guilty
of
such
actions
,
as
shall
put
it
in
the
power
of
another
,
even
by
a
look
,
to
mortify
him
!
<EOS>
And
if
poor
souls
can
be
thus
abjectly
struck
at
such
a
discovery
by
a
fellow
-
creature
,
how
must
they
appear
before
an
unerring
and
omniscient
Judge
,
with
a
conscience
standing
in
the
place
of
a
thousand
witnesses
?
<EOS>
and
calling
in
vain
upon
the
mountains
to
fall
upon
them
,
and
the
hills
to
cover
them
!
 
<EOS>
How
serious
this
subject
makes
one
!
  
<EOS>
SATURDAY
EVENING
.
  
<EOS>
I
am
just
retired
from
a
fatiguing
service
;
for
who
should
come
to
dine
with
Mr.
B.
but
that
sad
rake
Sir
Charles
Hargrave
;
and
Mr.
Walgrave
,
Mr.
Sedley
,
and
Mr.
Floyd
,
three
as
bad
as
himself
;
inseparable
companions
,
whose
whole
delight
is
drinking
,
hunting
,
and
lewdness
;
but
otherwise
gentlemen
of
wit
and
large
estates
.
<EOS>
Three
of
them
broke
in
upon
us
at
the
Hall
,
on
the
happiest
day
of
my
life
,
to
our
great
regret
;
and
they
had
been
long
threatening
to
make
this
visit
,
in
order
to
see
me
,
as
they
told
Mr.
B.
  
They
whipt
out
two
bottles
of
champagne
instantly
,
for
a
whet
,
as
they
called
it
;
and
went
to
view
the
stud
and
the
kennel
,
and
then
walked
in
the
garden
till
dinner
was
ready
;
my
Lord
Davers
,
Mr.
H.
and
Sir
Jacob
,
as
well
as
Mr.
B.
(
for
they
are
all
acquainted
)
accompanying
them
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Charles
,
it
seems
,
as
Lord
Davers
told
me
afterwards
;
said
,
he
longed
to
see
<EOS>
Mrs.
B.
She
was
the
talk
wherever
he
went
,
and
he
had
conceived
a
high
opinion
of
her
beforehand
.
  
<EOS>
Lord
Davers
said
,
"
I
defy
you
,
gentlemen
,
to
think
so
highly
of
her
as
she
deserves
,
take
mind
and
person
together
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Floyd
said
,
he
never
saw
any
woman
yet
,
who
came
up
to
what
he
expected
,
where
fame
had
been
lavish
in
her
praise
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
how
,
brother
baronet
,
"
said
Sir
Charles
to
Sir
Jacob
,
"
came
you
to
be
reconciled
to
her
?
<EOS>
I
heard
that
you
would
never
own
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oons
man
!
"
said
Sir
Jacob
,
"
I
was
taken
in
.
 
<EOS>
They
contrived
to
clap
her
upon
me
as
Lady
Jenny
C.
and
pretended
they
'd
keep
t'other
out
of
my
sight
;
and
I
was
plaguily
bit
,
and
forced
to
get
on
as
well
as
I
could
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
was
a
bite
indeed
,
"
said
Mr.
Walgrave
;
"
and
so
you
fell
a
praising
Lady
Jenny
<EOS>
,
I
warrant
,
to
the
skies
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ye
 
s
"
<EOS>
(
drawling
out
the
affirmative
monosyllable
)
,
"
I
was
used
most
scurvily
:
faith
I
was
.
<EOS>
I
bear
'em
a
grudge
for
it
still
,
I
can
tell
'em
that
;
for
I
have
hardly
been
able
to
hold
up
my
head
like
a
man
since
 
but
am
forced
to
go
and
come
,
and
to
do
as
they
bid
me
.
<EOS>
By
my
troth
,
I
never
was
so
manageable
in
my
life
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Your
Herefordshire
neighbours
,
Sir
Jacob
,
"
said
Mr.
Sedley
,
with
an
oath
,
"
will
rejoice
to
hear
this
;
for
the
whole
county
there
can
not
manage
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
quite
cow'd
now
,
as
you
will
see
by
-
and
-
by
;
nay
,
for
that
matter
,
if
you
can
set
Mrs.
B.
a
talking
,
not
one
of
you
all
will
care
to
open
your
lips
,
except
to
say
as
she
says
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Never
fear
,
old
boy
,
"
said
Sir
Charles
,
"
we
'll
bear
our
parts
in
conversation

<EOS>
I
never
saw
the
woman
yet
,
who
could
give
me
either
awe
or
love
for
six
minutes
together
.
<EOS>
What
think
you
,
Mr.
B.
?
<EOS>
Have
you
any
notion
,
that
your
lady
will
have
so
much
power
over
us
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
Sir
Charles
,
I
have
one
of
the
finest
women
in
England
;
but
I
neither
expect
nor
desire
you
rakes
<EOS>
should
see
her
with
my
eyes
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
,
if
I
have
a
mind
to
love
her
,
and
make
court
to
her
too
,
Mr.
B.
,
I
will
:
<EOS>
and
I
am
half
in
love
with
her
already
,
although
I
have
not
seen
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
They
came
in
when
dinner
was
near
ready
,
and
the
four
gentlemen
took
each
a
large
bumper
of
old
hock
for
another
whet
.
  
<EOS>
The
countess
,
Lady
Davers
,
and
I
came
down
together
.
<EOS>
The
gentlemen
knew
our
two
noble
ladies
,
and
were
known
to
them
in
person
,
as
well
as
by
character
.
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
,
in
his
usual
kind
and
encouraging
manner
,
took
my
hand
,
and
presented
the
four
gentlemen
to
me
,
each
by
his
name
.
<EOS>
Sir
Charles
said
,
pretty
bluntly
,
that
he
hoped
he
was
more
welcome
to
me
now
,
than
the
last
time
he
was
under
the
same
roof
with
me
;
for
he
had
been
told
since
,
that
that
was
our
happy
day
.
  
<EOS>
I
said
,
Mr.
B.
's
friends
were
always
welcome
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
Tis
<EOS>
well
,
Madam
,
"
said
Mr.
Sedley
,
"
we
did
not
know
how
it
was
.
<EOS>
We
should
have
quartered
ourselves
upon
Mr.
B.
for
a
week
together
,
and
kept
him
up
day
and
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
thought
this
speech
deserved
no
answer
,
especially
as
they
were
gentlemen
who
wanted
no
countenance
,
and
addressed
myself
to
Lord
Davers
,
who
is
always
kindly
making
court
to
me
:
"
I
hope
,
my
good
lord
,
you
find
yourself
quite
recovered
of
your
head
-
ache
?
"
<EOS>
(
of
which
he
complained
at
breakfast
)
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
thank
you
,
my
dear
sister
,
pretty
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
telling
Sir
Charles
and
the
other
gentlemen
,
niece
,
"
said
Sir
Jacob
,
"
how
I
was
cheated
here
,
when
I
came
first
,
with
a
Lady
Jenny
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
a
very
lucky
cheat
for
me
,
Sir
Jacob
;
for
it
gave
you
a
prepossession
in
my
favour
under
so
advantageous
a
character
,
that
I
could
never
have
expected
otherwise
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
,
"
said
the
countess
,
"
my
daughter
,
for
whom
Sir
Jacob
took
you
,
had
Mrs.
B.
's
qualities
to
boast
of
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
How
am
I
obliged
to
your
ladyship
's
goodness
,
"
returned
I
,
"
when
you
treat
me
with
even
greater
indulgence
than
you
use
to
so
beloved
a
daughter
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
now
you
talk
of
treating
,
"
said
Sir
Charles
,
"
when
,
ladies
,
will
you
treat
our
sex
with
the
politeness
which
you
shew
to
one
another
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
When
your
sex
deserve
it
,
Sir
Charles
,
"
answered
Lady
Davers
.
  
<EOS>
"
Who
is
to
be
judge
of
that
?
"
said
Mr.
Walgrave
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
the
gentlemen
,
I
hope
,
"
replied
my
lady
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
then
,
Mrs.
B.
,
"
said
Sir
Charles
,
"
we
bespeak
your
good
opinion
of
us
;
for
you
have
ours
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
obliged
to
you
,
gentlemen
;
but
I
must
be
more
cautious
in
declaring
mine
,
lest
it
should
be
thought
I
am
influenced
by
your
kind
,
and
perhaps
too
hasty
,
opinions
of
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Sir
Charles
swore
they
had
seen
enough
of
me
the
moment
I
entered
the
parlour
,
and
heard
enough
the
moment
I
opened
my
lips
to
answer
for
their
opinions
of
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
said
,
I
made
no
doubt
,
when
they
had
as
good
a
subject
to
expatiate
upon
,
as
I
had
,
in
the
pleasure
before
me
,
of
seeing
so
many
agreeable
friends
of
Mr.
B.
's
,
they
would
maintain
the
title
they
claimed
of
every
one
's
good
opinion
.
  
<EOS>
"
This
,
"
said
Sir
Jacob
,
"
is
binding
you
over
,
gentlemen
,
to
your
good
behaviour
.
<EOS>
You
must
know
,
my
niece
never
shoots
flying
,
as
you
do
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
gentlemen
laughed
:
"
Is
it
shooting
flying
,
Sir
Jacob
,
"
returned
Sir
Charles
,
"
to
praise
that
lady
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ads
-
bud
,
I
did
not
think
of
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
Jacob
,
"
said
the
countess
,
"
you
need
not
be
at
a
fault
;
 
for
a
good
sportsman
<EOS>
always
hits
his
mark
,
flying
or
not
;
and
the
gentlemen
had
so
fair
<EOS>
an
one
,
that
they
could
not
well
miss
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
fairly
helped
over
the
stile
,
Sir
Jacob
,
"
said
Mr.
Floyd
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
,
indeed
,
I
wanted
it
;
though
I
limped
like
a
puppy
before
I
was
lame
.
<EOS>
One
ca
n't
think
of
every
thing
as
one
used
to
do
at
your
time
of
life
,
gentlemen
.
<EOS>
"
This
flippant
stuff
was
all
that
passed
,
which
I
can
recite
;
for
the
rest
,
at
table
,
and
after
dinner
,
was
too
polite
by
half
for
me
;
such
as
,
the
quantity
of
wine
each
man
could
carry
off
(
that
was
the
phrase
)
,
dogs
,
horses
,
hunting
,
racing
,
cock
-
fighting
,
and
all
accompanied
with
swearing
and
cursing
,
and
that
in
good
humour
,
and
out
of
wantonness
(
the
least
excusable
and
more
profligate
sort
of
swearing
and
cursing
of
all
)
.
  
<EOS>
The
gentlemen
liked
the
wine
so
well
,
that
we
had
the
felicity
to
drink
tea
and
coffee
by
ourselves
;
only
Mr.
B.
(
upon
our
inviting
the
gentlemen
to
partake
with
us
)
sliding
in
for
a
few
minutes
to
tell
us
,
they
would
stick
by
what
they
had
,
and
taking
a
dish
of
coffee
with
us
.
  
<EOS>
I
should
not
omit
one
observation
;
that
Sir
Jacob
,
when
they
were
gone
,
said
they
were
pure
company
;
and
Mr.
H.
that
he
never
was
so
delighted
in
his
born
days
.
 
<EOS>
While
the
two
ladies
put
up
their
prayers
,
that
they
might
never
have
such
another
entertainment
.
<EOS>
And
being
encouraged
by
their
declaration
,
I
presumed
to
join
in
the
same
petition
.
  
<EOS>
Yet
it
seems
,
these
are
men
of
wit
!
<EOS>
I
believe
they
must
be
so
 
<EOS>
for
I
could
neither
like
nor
understand
them
.
<EOS>
Yet
,
if
their
conversation
had
much
wit
,
I
should
think
my
ladies
would
have
found
it
out
.
  
<EOS>
The
gentlemen
,
permit
me
to
add
,
went
away
very
merry
,
to
ride
ten
miles
by
owl
-
light
;
for
they
would
not
accept
of
beds
here
.
<EOS>
They
had
two
French
horns
with
them
,
and
gave
us
a
flourish
or
two
at
going
off
.
<EOS>
Each
had
a
servant
besides
:
but
the
way
they
were
in
would
have
given
me
more
concern
than
it
did
,
had
they
been
related
to
Mr.
B.
and
less
used
to
it
.
<EOS>
And
,
indeed
,
it
is
a
happiness
,
that
such
gentlemen
take
no
more
care
than
they
generally
do
,
to
interest
any
body
intimately
in
their
healths
and
preservation
;
for
these
are
all
single
men
.
<EOS>
Nor
need
the
public
,
any
more
than
the
private
,
be
much
concerned
about
them
;
for
let
such
persons
go
when
they
will
,
if
they
continue
single
,
their
next
heir
can
not
well
be
a
worse
commonwealth
's
man
;
and
there
is
a
great
chance
he
may
be
better
.
  
<EOS>
You
know
I
end
my
Saturdays
seriously
.
<EOS>
And
this
,
to
what
I
have
already
said
,
makes
me
add
,
that
I
can
not
express
how
much
I
am
,
my
dear
Miss
Darnford
,
your
faithful
and
affectionate
PB
    
From
Mrs.
B.
to
Miss
Darnford
.
<EOS>
In
Answer
to
Letters
XXXV
and
XXXVI
.
  
<EOS>
MY
DEAR
MISS
DARNFORD
,
  
<EOS>
I
skip
over
the
little
transactions
of
several
days
,
to
let
you
know
how
much
you
rejoice
me
,
in
telling
me
Sir
Simon
has
been
so
kind
as
to
comply
with
my
wishes
.
<EOS>
Both
your
most
agreeable
letters
came
to
my
hand
together
,
and
I
thank
you
a
hundred
times
for
them
;
and
I
thank
your
dear
mamma
,
and
Sir
Simon
too
,
for
the
pleasure
<EOS>
they
have
given
me
in
this
obliging
permission
.
<EOS>
How
happy
shall
we
be
!
 
<EOS>
But
how
long
will
you
be
permitted
to
stay
,
though
?
<EOS>
All
the
winter
,
I
hope
:
 
<EOS>
and
then
,
when
that
is
over
,
let
us
set
out
together
,
if
God
shall
spare
us
,
directly
for
Lincolnshire
;
and
to
pass
most
of
the
summer
likewise
in
each
other
's
company
.
<EOS>
What
a
sweet
thought
is
this
!
 
<EOS>
Let
me
indulge
it
a
little
while
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
read
your
letters
,
and
says
,
you
are
a
charming
young
lady
,
and
surpass
yourself
in
every
letter
.
<EOS>
I
told
him
,
that
he
was
more
interested
in
the
pleasure
I
took
in
this
favour
of
Sir
Simon
's
than
he
imagined
.
"
<EOS>
As
how
,
my
dear
?
"
said
he
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
plain
case
,
Sir
,
"
replied
I
:
"
for
endeavouring
to
improve
myself
by
Miss
Darnford
's
conversation
and
behaviour
,
I
shall
every
day
be
more
worthy
of
your
favour
.
"
<EOS>
He
kindly
would
have
it
,
that
nobody
,
no
,
not
Miss
Darnford
herself
,
excelled
me
.
  
<EOS>
@@@Tis
<EOS>
right
,
you
know
,
Miss
,
that
Mr.
B.
should
think
so
,
though
I
must
know
nothing
at
all
,
if
I
was
not
sensible
how
inferior
I
am
to
my
dear
Miss
Darnford
:
and
yet
,
when
I
look
abroad
now
-
and
-
then
,
I
could
be
a
proud
slut
,
if
I
would
,
and
not
yield
the
palm
to
many
others
.
  
<EOS>
Well
,
my
dear
Miss
,
  
SUNDAY
  
Is
past
and
gone
,
as
happy
as
the
last
;
the
two
ladies
,
and
,
at
their
earnest
request
,
Sir
Jacob
bearing
us
company
,
in
the
evening
part
.
<EOS>
My
Polly
was
there
morning
and
evening
,
with
her
heart
broken
almost
,
poor
girl
!
 
<EOS>
I
put
her
in
a
corner
of
my
closet
,
that
her
concern
should
not
be
minded
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jervis
gives
me
great
hopes
of
her
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Jacob
was
much
pleased
with
our
family
order
,
and
said
,
'
twas
no
wonder
I
kept
so
good
myself
,
and
made
others
so
:
and
he
thought
the
four
rakes
(
for
he
run
on
how
much
they
admired
me
)
would
be
converted
,
if
they
saw
how
well
I
passed
my
time
,
and
how
cheerful
and
easy
every
one
,
as
well
as
myself
was
under
it
!
<EOS>
He
said
,
when
he
came
home
,
he
must
take
such
a
method
himself
in
his
family
;
for
,
he
believed
,
it
would
make
not
only
better
masters
and
mistresses
,
but
better
children
,
and
better
servants
too
.
<EOS>
But
,
poor
gentleman
!
<EOS>
he
has
,
I
doubt
,
a
great
deal
to
mend
in
himself
,
before
he
can
begin
such
a
practice
with
efficacy
in
his
family
.
  
<EOS>
MONDAY
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
afternoon
.
<EOS>
Sir
Jacob
took
his
leave
of
us
,
highly
satisfied
with
us
both
,
and
particularly
(
so
he
said
)
with
me
;
and
promised
that
my
two
cousins
,
as
he
called
his
daughters
,
and
his
sister
,
an
old
maiden
lady
,
if
they
went
to
town
this
winter
,
should
visit
me
,
and
be
improved
by
me
;
that
was
his
word
.
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
accompanied
him
some
miles
on
his
journey
,
and
the
two
ladies
,
and
Lord
Davers
,
and
I
,
took
an
airing
in
the
coach
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
was
so
kind
as
to
tell
me
,
when
he
came
home
,
with
a
whisper
,
that
Miss
Goodwin
presented
her
duty
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
got
a
multitude
of
fine
things
for
the
dear
little
creature
,
and
Mr.
B.
promises
to
give
me
a
dairy
-
house
breakfast
,
when
our
guests
are
gone
.
  
<EOS>
I
enclose
the
history
of
this
little
charmer
,
by
Mr.
B.
's
consent
,
since
you
are
to
do
us
the
honour
,
as
he
(
as
well
as
I
)
pleases
himself
,
to
be
one
of
our
family
 
but
keep
it
to
yourself
,
whatever
you
do
.
<EOS>
I
am
guarantee
that
you
will
;
and
have
put
it
in
a
separate
paper
,
that
you
may
burn
it
when
read
.
<EOS>
For
I
may
want
your
advice
on
this
subject
,
having
a
great
desire
to
get
this
child
in
my
possession
;
and
yet
Lady
Davers
has
given
a
hint
,
that
dwells
a
little
with
me
.
<EOS>
When
I
have
the
pleasure
I
hope
for
,
I
will
lay
all
before
you
,
and
be
determined
,
and
proceed
,
as
far
as
I
have
power
,
by
you
.
<EOS>
You
,
my
good
father
and
mother
,
have
seen
the
story
in
my
former
papers
.
  
<EOS>
TUESDAY
.
  
<EOS>
You
must
know
,
I
pass
over
the
days
thus
swiftly
,
not
that
I
could
not
fill
them
up
with
writing
,
as
amply
as
I
have
done
the
former
;
but
intending
only
to
give
you
a
general
idea
of
our
way
of
life
and
conversation
;
and
having
gone
through
a
whole
week
and
more
,
you
will
be
able
,
from
what
I
have
recited
,
to
form
a
judgment
how
it
is
with
us
,
one
day
with
another
.
<EOS>
As
for
example
,
now
and
then
neighbourly
visits
received
and
paid
 
Needlework
between
whiles
 
Music

I

my
dear
Mr.
B.
and
my
two
good
ladies
 
<EOS>
A
lesson
from
him

when
alone

either
in
French
or
Latin
 
<EOS>
A
new
pauper

A

the

Mr.
Williams
's
departure

in
order
to
put
the
new
projected
alteration
in
force
,
which
is
to
deprive
me
of
my
chaplain
<EOS>
(
By
the
way
,
the
dean
is
highly
pleased
with
this
affair
,
and
the
motives
to
it
,
<EOS>
Mr.
Adams
being
a
favourite
of
his
,
and
a
distant
relation
of
his
lady

<EOS>
Mr.
H.

and
Polly

mutual
endeavour

avoid

another
 
<EOS>
My
lessons
to
the
poor
girl
,
and
cautions
,
as
if
she
were
my
sister
   
These
,
my
dear
Miss
Darnford
,
and
my
honoured
parents
,
are
the
pleasant
employments
of
our
time
;
so
far
as
we
females
are
concerned
:
for
the
gentlemen
hunt
,
ride
out
,
and
divert
themselves
in
their
way
,
and
bring
us
home
the
news
and
occurrences
they
meet
with
abroad
,
and
now
-
and
-
then
a
straggling
gentleman
they
pick
up
in
their
diversions
.
<EOS>
And
so
I
shall
not
enlarge
upon
these
articles
,
after
the
tedious
specimens
<EOS>
I
have
already
given
.
  
<EOS>
WEDNESDAY
,
THURSDAY
.
  
<EOS>
Could
you
ever
have
thought
,
my
dear
,
that
husbands
have
a
dispensing
power
over
their
wives
,
which
kings
are
not
allowed
over
the
laws
?
<EOS>
I
have
had
a
smart
debate
with
Mr.
B.
,
and
I
fear
it
will
not
be
the
only
one
upon
this
subject
.
<EOS>
Can
you
believe
,
that
if
a
wife
thinks
a
thing
her
duty
to
do
,
which
her
husband
does
not
approve
,
he
can
dispense
with
her
performing
it
,
and
no
sin
shall
lie
at
her
door
?
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
maintains
this
point
.
<EOS>
I
have
great
doubts
about
it
;
particularly
one
;
that
if
a
matter
be
my
duty
,
and
he
dispenses
with
my
performance
of
it
,
whether
,
even
although
that
were
to
clear
me
of
the
sin
,
it
will
not
fall
upon
himself
?
<EOS>
And
a
good
wife
would
be
as
much
concerned
at
this
,
as
if
it
was
to
remain
upon
her
.
<EOS>
Yet
he
seems
set
upon
it
.
<EOS>
What
can
one
do
?
 
<EOS>
Did
you
ever
hear
of
such
a
notion
,
before
?
<EOS>
Of
such
a
prerogative
in
a
husband
?
<EOS>
Would
you
care
to
subscribe
to
it
?
  
<EOS>
He
says
,
the
ladies
are
of
his
opinion
.
<EOS>
I
'm
afraid
they
are
,
and
so
will
not
ask
them
.
<EOS>
But
,
perhaps
,
I
may
n't
live
,
and
other
things
may
happen
;
and
<EOS>
so
I
'll
say
no
more
of
it
at
present
.

FRIDAY
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
H.
and
my
Lord
and
Lady
Davers
and
the
excellent
Countess
of
C.
<EOS>
having
left
us
this
day
,
to
our
mutual
regret
,
the
former
put
the
following
letter
into
my
hands
,
with
an
air
of
respect
and
even
reverence
.
<EOS>
He
says
,
he
spells
most
lamentably
;
and
this
obliges
me
to
give
it
you
literally
:
  
"
DEARE
GOOD
MADAM
,
  
<EOS>
"
I
cannott
contente
myself
with
common
thankes
,
on
leaving
youres
,
and
Mr.
B.
's
hospitabel
house
,
because
of
thatt
there
affaire
,
which
I
neede
not
mention
!
<EOS>
and
truly
am
ashamed
to
mention
,
as
I
have
been
to
looke
you
in
the
face
ever
since
it
<EOS>
happen'd
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
knowe
how
itt
came
aboute
,
butt
<EOS>
I
thought
butt
att
first
of
joking
a
littel
,
or
soe
;
and
seeing
Polley
heard
me
with
more
attentiveness
than
I
expected
,
I
was
encouraged
to
proceede
;
and
soe
,
now
I
recollecte
,
itt
camn
aboute

<EOS>
"
But
she
is
innosente
for
me
:
and
I
do
n't
knowe
how
thatt
came
about
neither
;
for
wee
were
oute
one
moonelighte
nighte
in
the
garden
,
walking
aboute
,
and
afterwards
tooke
a
napp
of
two
houres
,
as
I
beliefe
,
in
the
summer
-
house
in
the
littel
gardin
,
being
over

powered
with
sleepe
;
<EOS>
for
I
woulde

But
I

hadd

<EOS>
prevented
itt
,
by
being
at
home
,
when
we
thought
you
abroad

<EOS>
For
I
was
to
come
to
her
when
shee
hemm'd
two
or
three
times
;
for
having
made
a
contract
,
you
knowe

<EOS>
Madam

it
was
naturall
enough
to
take
the
first
occasion
to
putt
itt
in

<EOS>
"
Poor
Polley

<EOS>
I
pity

<EOS>
Do
n't
thinke
the
worse
of
her

deare

so

to
turn

away

because
it
may
bee
her
ruin

<EOS>
I
do
n't
desire
too

her

<EOS>
I
might
have
been
drawne
in
to
do
strange
foolish
things
,
and
been
ruin'd
at
the
long
run

for
who

mought

ended

My

My

I

on
this

know
not

<EOS>
I
hope
you
can
read
my

<EOS>
I
know
I
write
a
clumsy
hand

spelle
most
lamentabelly
;
for
I
never
had
a
tallent

I
was

half
to
admire

I

So
pray

I
knowe
<EOS>
I
neede
give
no
advice
to
Polley
,
to
take
care
of
first
encouragements

<EOS>
Poor
girl
!
<EOS>
she
mought
have
suffer'd
<EOS>
sadly
,
as
welle
as
I.
For
iff
my

my
unkell

had
requir'd
mee
to
turne

off
,
you
know
itt
woulde
have
been
undutifull
to
have
refused
them
,
notwithstanding
our
bargaine
.
<EOS>
And
want
of
duty
to
them
woulde
have
been
to
have
added
faulte
too
faulte
:
as
you
once
observed
,
I
remember
,
that
one
faulte
never
comes
alone
,
but
drawes
after
itt
generally
five
or
six
,
to
hide
or
vindicate
itt
,
and
they
every
one
perhapps
as
many
more
eache

<EOS>
"
I
shall
never

severall
of

I

may
I
be
hang'd

if
I

not

many

thatt
I
coulde
not
make
such
observations

you

and
a
man
besides
,
and
a

<EOS>
but
my
tallents
lie
another
way

and
by
that
time
my
father
dies
<EOS>
,
I
hope
to
improve
myselfe
,
in
order
to
cutt
such
a

may

be
no

"
<EOS>
Well
,
but
whatt
is
all
this
to
the
purpose

<EOS>
I
will
keep
close

my
text

and
that
is
,
to
thank
you
,
good
Madam

for
all
the
favours
I
have
received
in

to
thank
you
for
disappointing

and
for
convincing
mee

in
so
kinde

yet
so
shameing
a
manner
,
how
wrong
I
was
in
the
matter
of
that
<EOS>
there
Polley

and
for
not
exposing
my
folly

assuring

Well
,
Miss
Darnford
,
what
shall
we
say
to
this
fine
letter
?
 
<EOS>
You
'll
allow
it
to
be
an
original
,
I
hope
.
<EOS>
Yet
,
may
-
be
not
.
<EOS>
For
it
may
be
as
well
written
,
and
as
sensible
a
letter
as
this
class
of
people
generally
write
!
  
<EOS>
Mr.
H.
dresses
well
,
is
not
a
contemptible
figure
of
a
man
,
laughs
,
talks
,
where
he
can
be
heard
,
and
his
aunt
is
not
present
;
and
cuts
,
to
use
his
own
word
,
a
considerable
figure
in
a
country
town
.
 
<EOS>
But
see
 
<EOS>
Yet
I
will
not
say
what
I
might
 
<EOS>
He
is
Lord
Davers
's
nephew
;
and
if
he
makes
his
observations
,
and
forbears
his
speeches
(
I
mean
,
can
be
silent
,
and
only
laugh
when
he
sees
somebody
of
more
sense
laugh
,
and
never
approve
or
condemn
but
in
leading
-
strings
)
,
he
may
possibly
pass
in
a
crowd
of
gentlemen
.
<EOS>
But
poor
,
poor
Polly
Barlow
!
<EOS>
What
can
I
say
for
Polly
Barlow
?
  
<EOS>
I
have
a
time
in
view
,
when
my
papers
may
fall
under
the
inspection
of
a
dear
gentleman
,
to
whom
,
next
to
God
,
I
am
accountable
for
all
my
actions
and
correspondences
;
so
I
will
either
write
an
account
of
the
matter
,
and
seal
it
up
separately
,
for
Mr.
B.
,
or
,
at
a
fit
opportunity
,
break
it
to
him
,
and
let
him
know
(
under
secrecy
,
if
he
will
promise
it
)
<EOS>
the
steps
I
took
in
it
;
lest
something
arise
hereafter
,
when
I
can
not
answer
for
myself
,
to
render
any
thing
dark
or
questionable
in
it
.
<EOS>
A
method
,
I
believe
,
very
proper
to
be
taken
by
every
married
lady
;
and
I
presume
the
rather
to
say
so
,
having
had
a
good
example
for
it
:
for
I
have
often
thought
of
a
little
sealed
up
parcel
of
papers
,
my
lady
made
me
burn
in
her
presence
,
about
a
month
before
she
died
.
<EOS>
"
They
are
,
Pamela
,
"
said
she
,
"
such
as
would
not
concern
me
,
let
who
will
see
them
,
could
they
know
the
springs
and
causes
of
them
;
but
,
for
want
of
a
clue
,
my
son
might
be
at
a
loss
what
to
think
of
several
of
those
letters
were
he
to
find
them
,
in
looking
over
my
other
papers
,
when
I
am
no
more
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Let
me
add
,
that
nothing
could
be
more
endearing
than
our
parting
with
our
noble
guests
.
<EOS>
My
lady
repeated
her
commands
for
what
she
often
engaged
me
to
promise
,
that
is
to
say
,
to
renew
the
correspondence
begun
between
us
,
so
much
(
as
she
was
pleased
to
say
)
to
her
satisfaction
.
  
<EOS>
I
could
not
help
shewing
her
ladyship
,
who
was
always
enquiring
after
my
writing
employment
,
most
of
what
passed
between
you
and
me
:
she
admires
you
much
,
and
wished
Mr.
H.
had
more
wit
,
that
was
her
word
:
she
should
in
that
case
,
she
said
,
be
very
glad
to
set
on
foot
a
treaty
between
you
and
him
.
  
<EOS>
But
that
,
I
fancy
,
can
never
be
tolerable
to
you
;
and
I
only
mention
it
en
passant
.
 
<EOS>
There
's
a
French
woman
for
you
!
  
<EOS>
The
countess
was
full
of
her
kind
wishes
for
my
happiness
;
and
my
Lady
Davers
told
me
,
that
if
I
could
give
her
timely
notice
,
she
would
be
present
on
a
certain
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
But
,
my
dear
Miss
,
what
could
I
say
?
 
<EOS>
I
know
nothing
of
the
matter
!
 
<EOS>
Only
,
I
am
a
sad
coward
,
and
have
a
thousand
anxieties
which
I
can
not
mention
to
any
body
.
  
<EOS>
But
,
if
I
have
such
in
the
honourable
estate
of
matrimony
,
what
must
those
poor
souls
have
,
who
are
seduced
,
and
have
all
manner
of
reason
to
apprehend
,
that
the
crime
shall
be
followed
by
a
punishment
so
natural
to
it
?
<EOS>
A
punishment
in
kind
,
as
I
may
say
;
which
if
it
only
ends
in
forfeiture
of
life
,
following
the
forfeiture
of
fame
,
must
be
thought
merciful
and
happy
beyond
expectation
:
for
how
shall
they
lay
claim
to
the
hope
given
to
persons
in
their
circumstances
that
they
shall
be
saved
in
child
-
bearing
,
since
the
condition
is
,
if
they
CONTINUE
in
faith
and
charity
,
and
HOLINESS
with
SOBRIETY
.
  
<EOS>
Now
,
my
honoured
mother
,
and
my
dear
Miss
Darnford
since
I
am
upon
this
affecting
subject
,
does
not
this
text
seem
to
give
a
comfortable
hope
to
a
good
woman
,
who
shall
thus
die
,
of
being
happy
in
the
Divine
mercies
?
<EOS>
For
the
Apostle
,
in
the
context
,
says
,
that
he
suffers
not
a
woman
to
teach
,
nor
usurp
authority
over
the
man
,
but
to
be
in
silence
.
 
<EOS>
And
what
is
the
reason
he
gives
?
<EOS>
Why
,
a
reason
that
is
a
natural
consequence
of
the
curse
on
the
first
disobedience
,
that
she
shall
be
in
subjection
to
her
husband
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
For
,
"
says
he
,
"
Adam
was
NOT
deceived
;
but
the
woman
,
being
deceived
,
was
in
the
transgression
.
<EOS>
"
As
much
as
to
say
 
Had
it
not
been
for
the
woman
,
Adam
had
kept
his
integrity
,
and
therefore
her
punishment
shall
be
,
as
it
is
said
,
"
I
will
greatly
multiply
thy
sorrow
in
thy
conception
:
in
sorrow
shall
thou
bring
forth
children
 
and
thy
husband
shall
rule
over
thee
.
"
<EOS>
But
nevertheless
,
if
thou
shalt
not
survive
the
sharpness
of
thy
sorrow
,
thy
death
shall
be
deemed
to
be
such
an
alleviation
of
thy
part
of
the
entailed
transgression
,
that
thou
shalt
be
saved
,
if
thou
hast
CONTINUED
in
faith
and
charity
,
and
HOLINESS
with
SOBRIETY
.
  
<EOS>
This
,
my
honoured
parents
,
and
my
dear
friend
,
is
my
paraphrase
;
and
I
reap
no
small
comfort
from
it
,
when
I
meditate
upon
it
.
  
<EOS>
But
I
shall
make
you
as
serious
as
myself
;
and
,
my
dear
friend
,
perhaps
,
frighten
you
from
entering
into
a
state
,
in
which
our
poor
sex
suffer
so
much
,
from
the
bridal
morning
,
let
it
rise
as
gaily
as
it
will
upon
a
thoughtful
mind
,
to
that
affecting
circumstance
,
(
throughout
its
whole
progression
)
,
for
which
nothing
but
a
tender
,
a
generous
,
and
a
worthy
husband
can
make
them
any
part
of
amends
.
  
<EOS>
But
a
word
or
two
more
,
as
to
the
parting
with
our
honoured
company
.
<EOS>
I
was
a
little
indisposed
,
and
they
all
would
excuse
me
,
against
my
will
,
from
attending
them
in
the
coach
some
miles
,
which
their
dear
brother
did
.
<EOS>
Both
ladies
most
tenderly
saluted
me
,
twice
or
thrice
a
-
piece
,
folding
their
kind
arms
about
me
,
and
wishing
my
safety
and
health
,
and
charging
me
to
think
little
,
and
hope
much
;
for
they
saw
me
thoughtful
at
times
,
though
I
endeavoured
to
hide
it
from
them
.
  
<EOS>
My
Lord
Davers
said
,
with
a
goodness
of
temper
that
is
peculiar
to
him
,
"
My
dearest
sister
,
 
May
God
preserve
you
,
and
multiply
your
comforts
!
<EOS>
I
shall
pray
for
you
more
than
ever
<EOS>
I
did
for
myself
,
though
I
have
so
much
more
need
of
it
:
 
<EOS>
I
must
leave
you
 
<EOS>
But
I
leave
one
whom
I
love
and
honour
next
to
Lady
Davers
,
and
ever
shall
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
H.
looked
consciously
silly
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
say
nothing
,
Madam
,
but
"
(
saluting
me
)
"
that
I
shall
never
forget
your
goodness
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
had
before
,
in
Mrs.
Jervis
's
parlour
,
taken
leave
of
Mrs.
Worden
and
Mrs.
Lesley
,
my
ladies
'
women
<EOS>
:
they
each
stole
a
hand
of
mine
,
and
kissed
it
,
begging
pardon
for
the
freedom
.
<EOS>
But
I
answered
,
taking
each
by
her
hand
,
and
kissing
her
,
"
I
shall
always
think
of
you
with
pleasure
,
my
good
friends
;
for
you
have
encouraged
me
constantly
by
your
presence
in
my
private
duties
;
and
may
God
bless
you
,
and
the
worthy
families
you
so
laudably
serve
,
as
well
for
your
sakes
,
as
their
own
!
"
  
<EOS>
They
turned
away
with
tears
;
and
Mrs.
Worden
would
have
said
something
to
me
,
but
could
not
.
 
<EOS>
Only
both
taking
Mrs.
Jervis
by
the
hand
,
"
Happy
Mrs.
Jervis
!
"
<EOS>
said
they
,
almost
in
a
breath
.
"
<EOS>
And
happy
I
too
,
"
repeated
I
,
"
in
my
Mrs.
Jervis
,
and
in
such
kind
well
-
wishers
as
Mrs.
Worden
and
Mrs.
Lesley
.
<EOS>
Wear
this
,
Mrs.
Worden
;
 
wear
this
,
Mrs.
Lesley
,
for
my
sake
:
"
and
to
each
I
gave
a
ring
,
with
a
crystal
and
brilliants
set
about
it
,
which
Mr.
B.
had
bought
a
week
before
for
this
purpose
:
he
has
a
great
opinion
of
both
the
good
folks
,
and
often
praised
their
prudence
,
and
quiet
and
respectful
behaviour
to
every
body
,
so
different
from
the
impertinence
(
that
was
his
word
)
of
most
ladies
'
women
who
are
favourites
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jervis
said
,
"
I
have
enjoyed
many
happy
hours
in
your
conversation
,
Mrs.
Worden
and
Mrs.
Lesley
:
I
shall
miss
you
very
much
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
endeavour
,
"
said
I
,
taking
her
hand
,
"
to
make
it
up
to
you
,
my
good
friend
,
as
well
as
I
can
.
<EOS>
And
of
late
we
have
not
had
so
many
opportunities
together
as
I
should
have
wished
,
had
I
not
been
so
agreeably
engaged
as
you
know
.
<EOS>
So
we
must
each
try
to
comfort
the
other
,
when
we
have
lost
,
I
such
noble
,
and
you
such
worthy
companions
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jervis
's
honest
heart
,
before
touched
by
the
parting
,
shewed
itself
at
her
eyes
.
<EOS>
"
Wonder
not
,
"
said
I
,
to
the
two
gentlewomen
,
wiping
with
my
handkerchief
her
venerable
cheeks
,
"
that
I
always
thus
endeavour
to
dry
up
all
my
good
Mrs.
Jervis
's
tears
;
"
and
then
I
kissed
her
,
thinking
of
you
,
my
dear
mother
;
and
I
was
forced
to
withdraw
a
little
abruptly
,
lest
I
should
be
too
much
moved
myself
;
for
had
our
departing
company
enquired
into
the
occasion
,
they
would
perhaps
have
thought
it
derogatory
(
though
I
should
not
)
to
my
present
station
,
and
too
much
retrospecting
to
my
former
.
  
<EOS>
I
could
not
,
in
conversation
between
Mr.
B.
and
myself
,
when
I
was
gratefully
expatiating
upon
the
amiable
characters
of
our
noble
guests
,
and
of
their
behaviour
and
kindness
to
me
,
help
observing
,
that
I
had
little
expected
,
from
some
hints
which
formerly
dropt
from
Mr.
B.
,
to
find
my
good
Lord
Davers
so
polite
and
so
sensible
a
man
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
a
very
good
-
natured
man
,
"
replied
Mr.
B.
<EOS>
"
I
believe
I
might
once
or
twice
drop
some
disrespectful
words
of
him
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
the
effect
of
passion
at
the
time
,
and
with
a
view
to
two
or
three
points
of
his
conduct
in
public
life
;
for
which
I
took
the
liberty
to
find
fault
with
him
,
and
received
very
unsatisfactory
excuses
.
<EOS>
One
of
these
,
I
remember
,
was
in
a
conference
between
a
committee
of
each
house
of
parliament
,
in
which
he
behaved
in
a
way
I
could
not
wish
from
a
man
so
nearly
allied
to
me
by
marriage
;
for
all
he
could
talk
of
,
was
the
dignity
of
their
house
,
when
the
reason
of
the
thing
was
strong
with
the
other
;
and
it
fell
to
my
lot
to
answer
what
he
said
;
which
I
did
with
some
asperity
;
and
this
occasioned
a
coolness
between
us
for
some
time
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
no
man
makes
a
better
figure
in
private
life
than
Lord
Davers
;
especially
now
that
my
sister
's
good
sense
has
got
the
better
of
her
passions
,
and
she
can
behave
with
tolerable
decency
towards
him
.
<EOS>
For
once
,
Pamela
,
it
was
not
so
:
the
violence
of
her
spirit
making
him
appear
in
a
light
too
little
advantageous
either
to
his
quality
or
merit
.
<EOS>
But
now
he
improves
upon
me
every
time
I
see
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
not
,
my
dear
,
what
a
disgrace
a
haughty
and
passionate
woman
brings
upon
her
husband
,
and
upon
herself
too
,
in
the
eyes
of
her
own
sex
,
as
well
as
ours
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
even
those
ladies
,
who
would
be
as
glad
of
dominion
as
she
,
if
they
might
be
permitted
to
exercise
it
,
despise
others
who
do
,
and
the
man
most
who
suffers
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
let
me
tell
you
,
"
said
the
dear
man
,
with
an
air
that
shewed
he
was
satisfied
with
his
own
conduct
in
this
particular
,
"
that
you
can
not
imagine
how
much
a
woman
owes
to
her
husband
,
as
well
with
regard
to
her
own
_
peace
of
mind
,
as
to
_
both
their
reputations
(
however
it
may
go
against
the
grain
with
her
sometimes
)
,
if
he
be
a
man
who
has
discretion
to
keep
her
encroaching
passions
under
a
genteel
and
reasonable
control
!
"
  
<EOS>
How
do
you
like
this
doctrine
,
Miss
?
 
<EOS>
I
'll
warrant
,
you
believe
,
that
I
could
do
no
less
than
drop
Mr.
B.
one
of
my
best
curt'sies
,
in
acknowledgment
of
my
obligation
to
him
,
for
so
considerately
preserving
to
me
my
peace
of
mind
,
and
my
reputation
,
as
well
as
his
own
,
in
this
case
.
  
<EOS>
But
after
all
,
when
one
duly
weighs
the
matter
,
what
he
says
may
be
right
in
the
main
;
for
I
have
not
been
able
to
contradict
him
,
partial
as
I
am
to
my
sex
,
when
he
has
pointed
out
to
me
instances
in
the
behaviour
of
certain
ladies
,
who
,
like
children
,
the
more
they
have
been
humoured
,
the
more
humoursome
they
have
grown
;
which
must
have
occasioned
as
great
uneasiness
to
themselves
,
as
to
their
husbands
.
<EOS>
Will
you
excuse
me
,
my
dear
?
<EOS>
This
is
between
ourselves
;
for
I
did
not
own
so
much
to
Mr.
B.
<EOS>
For
one
should
not
give
up
one
's
sex
,
you
know
,
if
one
can
help
it
:
for
the
men
will
be
as
apt
to
impose
,
as
the
women
to
encroach
,
I
doubt
.
  
<EOS>
Well
,
but
here
,
my
honest
parents
,
and
my
dear
Miss
Darnford
,
at
last
,
I
end
my
journal
-
wise
letters
,
as
I
may
call
them
;
our
noble
guests
being
gone
,
and
our
time
and
employments
rolling
on
in
much
the
same
manner
,
as
in
past
days
,
of
which
I
have
given
an
account
.
<EOS>
I
am
,
my
dearest
father
and
mother
,
and
best
beloved
Miss
Darnford
,
your
dutiful
and
affectionate
  
P.B.
    
MY
DEAR
MISS
DARNFORD
,
  
<EOS>
I
hear
that
Mrs.
Jewkes
is
in
no
good
state
of
health
.
<EOS>
I
am
very
sorry
for
it
.
<EOS>
I
pray
for
her
life
,
that
she
may
be
a
credit
(
if
it
please
God
)
to
the
penitence
she
has
so
lately
assumed
.
  
<EOS>
Do
,
my
dear
good
Miss
,
vouchsafe
to
the
poor
soul
the
honour
of
a
visit
:
she
may
be
low
-
spirited
.
 
<EOS>
She
may
be
too
much
sunk
with
the
recollection
of
past
things
.
<EOS>
Comfort
,
with
that
sweetness
which
is
so
natural
to
Miss
Darnford
,
her
drooping
heart
;
and
let
her
know
,
that
I
have
a
true
concern
for
her
,
and
give
it
her
in
charge
to
take
care
of
herself
,
and
spare
nothing
that
will
administer
either
to
her
health
or
peace
of
mind
.
  
<EOS>
You
'll
pardon
me
that
I
put
you
upon
an
office
so
unsuitable
from
a
lady
in
your
station
,
to
a
person
in
hers
;
but
not
to
your
piety
and
charity
,
where
a
duty
so
eminent
as
that
of
visiting
the
sick
,
and
cheering
the
doubting
mind
,
is
in
the
question
.
  
<EOS>
I
know
your
condescension
will
give
her
great
comfort
;
and
if
she
should
be
hastening
to
her
account
,
what
a
pleasure
will
it
give
such
a
lady
as
you
,
to
have
illuminated
a
benighted
mind
,
when
it
was
tottering
on
the
verge
of
death
!
  
<EOS>
I
know
she
will
want
no
spiritual
help
from
good
Mr.
Peters
;
but
then
the
kind
notice
of
so
generally
esteemed
a
young
lady
,
will
raise
her
more
than
can
be
imagined
:
for
there
is
a
tenderness
,
a
sympathy
,
in
the
good
persons
of
our
sex
to
one
another
,
that
(
while
the
best
of
the
other
seem
but
to
act
as
in
office
,
saying
those
things
,
which
,
though
edifying
and
convincing
,
one
is
not
certain
proceeds
not
rather
from
the
fortitude
of
their
minds
,
than
the
tenderness
of
their
natures
)
<EOS>
mingles
with
one
's
very
spirits
,
thins
the
animal
mass
,
and
runs
through
one
's
heart
in
the
same
lify
current
<EOS>
(
I
ca
n't
clothe
my
thought
suitably
to
express
what
I
would
)
,
giving
assurance
,
as
well
as
pleasure
,
in
the
most
arduous
cases
,
and
brightening
our
misty
prospects
,
till
we
see
the
Sun
of
Righteousness
rising
on
the
hills
of
comfort
,
and
dispelling
the
heavy
fogs
of
doubt
and
diffidence
.
  
<EOS>
This
it
is
makes
me
wish
and
long
as
I
do
,
for
the
company
of
my
dear
Miss
Darnford
.
<EOS>
O
when
shall
I
see
you
?
<EOS>
When
shall
I
?
 
<EOS>
To
speak
to
my
present
case
,
it
is
all
I
long
for
;
and
,
pardon
my
freedom
of
expression
,
as
well
as
thought
,
<EOS>
when
I
let
you
know
in
this
instance
,
how
early
I
experience
the
ardent
longings
of
one
in
the
way
I
am
in
.
  
<EOS>
But
I
ought
not
to
set
my
heart
upon
any
thing
not
in
my
own
power
,
and
which
may
be
subject
to
accidents
,
and
the
control
of
others
.
<EOS>
But
let
whatever
interventions
happen
,
so
I
have
your
will
to
come
,
I
must
be
rejoiced
in
your
kind
intention
,
although
your
power
should
not
prove
answerable
.
  
<EOS>
But
I
will
say
no
more
,
than
that
I
am
,
my
honoured
father
and
mother
,
your
ever
dutiful
daughter
;
<EOS>
and
,
my
dear
Miss
Darnford
,
your
affectionate
and
obliged
P.B.
    
From
Miss
Darnford

We
are
greatly
obliged
to
you

every

not

admire
you

your
judicious

so
easy

uncommon

;
Mr.
H.
's
letter
(
an
original
indeed
!
)
have
all
greatly
entertained
us
,
as
your
prerogative
hints
have
amused
us
:
but
we
defer
our
opinion
of
those
hints
,
till
we
have
the
case
more
fully
explained
.
  
<EOS>
But
,
my
dear
friend
,
are
you
not
in
danger
of
falling
into
a
too
thoughtful
and
gloomy
way
?
<EOS>
By
the
latter
part
of
your
last
letter
,
we
are
afraid
you
are
;
and
my
mamma
,
and
Mrs.
Jones
,
and
Mrs.
Peters
,
enjoin
me
to
write
,
to
caution
you
on
that
head
.
<EOS>
But
there
is
the
less
need
of
it
,
because
your
prudence
will
always
suggest
to
you
reasons
,
as
it
does
in
that
very
letter
,
that
must
out
-
balance
your
fears
.
<EOS>
Think
little
,
and
hope
much
,
is
a
good
lesson
in
your
case
,
and
to
a
lady
of
your
temper
;
and
I
hope
Lady
Davers
will
not
in
vain
have
given
you
that
caution
.
<EOS>
After
all
,
I
dare
say
your
thoughtfulness
is
but
symptomatical
,
and
will
go
off
in
proper
time
.
  
<EOS>
But
to
wave
this
:
let
me
ask
you
,
is
Mr.
B.
's
conduct
to
you
as
respectful
<EOS>
,
I
do
n't
mean
fond
,
when
you
are
alone
together
,
as
in
company
?
 
<EOS>
Forgive
me
 
<EOS>
But
you
have
hinted
two
or
three
times
,
in
your
letters
,
that
he
always
is
most
complaisant
to
you
in
company
;
and
you
observe
,
that
wisely
does
he
act
in
this
,
as
he
thereby
does
credit
with
every
body
to
his
own
choice
.
<EOS>
I
make
no
doubt
,
that
the
many
charming
scenes
which
your
genius
and
fine
behaviour
furnish
out
to
him
,
must
,
as
often
as
they
happen
,
inspire
him
with
joy
,
and
even
rapture
:
and
must
make
him
love
you
more
for
your
mind
than
for
your
person
:
 
but
these
rapturous
scenes
last
very
little
longer
than
the
present
moment
.
<EOS>
What
I
want
to
know
is
,
whether
in
the
steadier
parts
of
life
,
when
you
are
both
nearer
the
level
of
us
common
folks
,
he
give
up
any
thing
of
his
own
will
in
compliment
to
yours
?
<EOS>
Whether
he
acts
the
part
of
a
respectful
,
polite
gentleman
,
in
his
behaviour
to
you
;
and
breaks
not
into
your
retirements
,
in
the
dress
,
and
with
the
brutal
roughness
of
a
fox
-
hunter
?
 
<EOS>
Making
no
difference
,
perhaps
,
between
the
field
or
his
stud
(
I
will
not
say
kennel
)
and
your
chamber
or
closet
?
 
<EOS>
Policy
,
for
his
own
credit
-
sake
,
as
I
mentioned
,
accounts
to
me
well
,
for
his
complaisance
to
you
in
public
.
<EOS>
But
his
regular
and
uniform
behaviour
to
you
,
in
your
retirement
,
when
the
conversation
between
you
turns
upon
usual
and
common
subjects
,
and
you
have
not
obliged
him
to
rise
to
admiration
of
you
,
by
such
scenes
as
those
of
your
two
parsons
,
Sir
Jacob
Swynford
,
and
the
like
:
is
what
would
satisfy
my
curiosity
,
if
you
please
to
give
me
an
instance
or
two
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
Now
,
my
dearest
Mrs.
B.
,
if
you
can
give
me
a
case
,
partly
or
nearly
thus
circumstanced
,
you
will
highly
oblige
me
:
  
<EOS>
First
,
where
he
has
borne
with
any
infirmity
of
your
own
;
and
I
know
of
none
where
you
can
give
him
such
an
opportunity
,
except
you
get
into
a
vapourish
habit
,
by
giving
way
to
a
temper
too
thoughtful
and
apprehensive
:
  
<EOS>
Next
,
that
,
in
complaisance
to
your
will
,
he
recedes
from
his
own
in
any
one
instance
:
  
Next
,
whether
he
breaks
not
into
your
retirements
unceremoniously
,
and
without
apology
or
concern
,
as
I
hinted
above
.
  
<EOS>
You
know
,
my
dear
Mrs.
B.
,
all
I
mean
,
by
what
I
have
said
.
<EOS>
;
and
if
you
have
any
pretty
conversation
in
memory
,
by
the
recital
of
which
,
this
my
bold
curiosity
may
be
answered
,
pray
oblige
me
with
it
;
and
we
shall
be
able
to
judge
by
it
,
not
only
of
the
in
-
born
generosity
which
all
that
know
Mr.
B.
have
been
willing
to
attribute
to
him
,
but
of
the
likelihood
of
the
continuance
of
both
your
felicities
,
upon
terms
suitable
to
the
characters
of
a
fine
lady
and
fine
gentleman
:
and
,
of
consequence
,
worthy
of
the
imitation
of
the
most
delicate
of
our
own
sex
.
  
<EOS>
Your
obliging
longings
,
my
beloved
dear
lady
,
for
my
company
,
I
hope
,
will
very
soon
be
answered
.
<EOS>
My
papa
was
so
pleased
with
your
sweet
earnestness
on
this
occasion
,
that
he
joined
with
my
mamma
;
and
both
,
with
equal
cheerfulness
,
said
,
you
should
not
be
many
days
in
London
before
me
.
<EOS>
Murray
and
his
mistress
go
on
swimmingly
,
and
have
not
yet
had
one
quarrel
.
<EOS>
The
only
person
,
he
,
of
either
sex
,
that
ever
knew
Nancy
so
intimately
,
and
so
long
,
without
one
!
  
<EOS>
This
is
all
I
have
to
say
,
at
present
,
when
I
have
assured
you
,
my
dear
Mrs.
B.
,
how
much
I
am
your
obliged
,
and
affectionate
POLLY
DARNFORD
.
    
<EOS>
My
dearest
Miss
Darnford
,
  
<EOS>
I
was
afraid
I
ended
my
last
letter
in
a
gloomy
way
;
and
I
am
obliged
to
you
for
the
kind
and
friendly
notice
you
take
of
it
.
<EOS>
It
was
owing
to
a
train
of
thinking
which
sometimes
I
get
into
,
of
late
;
I
hope
only
symptomatically
,
as
you
say
,
and
that
the
cause
and
effect
will
soon
vanish
together
.
  
<EOS>
But
what
a
task
,
my
dear
friend
,
I
'll
warrant
,
you
think
you
have
set
me
!
<EOS>
I
thought
,
in
the
progress
of
my
journal
,
and
in
my
letters
,
I
had
given
so
many
instances
of
Mr.
B.
's
polite
tenderness
to
me
,
that
no
new
ones
would
be
required
at
my
hands
;
and
when
I
said
he
was
always
most
complaisant
before
company
,
I
little
expected
,
that
such
an
inference
would
be
drawn
from
my
words
,
as
would
tend
to
question
the
uniformity
of
his
behaviour
to
me
,
when
there
were
no
witnesses
to
it
.
<EOS>
But
I
am
glad
of
an
opportunity
to
clear
up
all
your
doubts
on
this
subject
.
  
<EOS>
To
begin
then
:
  
<EOS>
You
first
desire
an
instance
,
where
Mr.
B.
has
borne
with
some
infirmity
of
mine
:
  
<EOS>
Next
,
that
in
complaisance
to
my
will
,
he
has
receded
from
his
own
:
  
<EOS>
And
lastly
,
whether
he
breaks
not
into
my
retirements
unceremoniously
;
and
without
apology
or
concern
,
making
no
difference
between
the
field
or
the
stud
,
and
my
chamber
or
closet
?
  
<EOS>
As
to
the
first
,
his
bearing
with
my
infirmities
;
he
is
daily
giving
instances
of
his
goodness
to
me
on
this
head
;
and
I
am
ashamed
to
say
,
that
of
late
I
give
him
so
much
occasion
for
them
as
I
do
;
but
he
sees
my
apprehensiveness
,
at
times
,
though
I
endeavour
to
conceal
it
;
and
no
husband
was
ever
so
soothing
and
so
indulgent
as
Mr.
B.
He
gives
me
the
best
advice
,
<EOS>
as
to
my
malady
,
if
I
may
call
it
one
:
treats
me
with
redoubled
tenderness
:
<EOS>
talks
to
me
upon
the
subjects
I
most
delight
to
dwell
upon
:
as
of
my
worthy
parents
;
what
they
are
doing
at
this
time
,
and
at
that
;
of
our
intended
journey
to
London
;
of
the
diversions
of
the
town
;
of
Miss
Darnford
's
company
;
and
when
he
goes
abroad
,
sends
up
my
good
Mrs.
Jervis
to
me
,
because
I
should
not
be
alone
:
at
other
times
,
takes
me
abroad
with
him
,
brings
this
neighbour
and
that
neighbour
to
visit
;
and
carries
me
to
visit
them
;
talks
of
our
journey
to
Kent
,
and
into
Lincolnshire
,
and
to
my
Lady
Davers
's
,
to
Bath
,
to
Tunbridge
,
and
I
ca
n't
tell
whither
,
when
the
apprehended
time
shall
be
over
.
 
<EOS>
In
fine
,
my
dear
Miss
Darnford
,
you
can
not
imagine
one
half
of
his
tender
goodness
and
politeness
to
me
!
 
<EOS>
Then
he
hardly
ever
goes
to
any
distance
,
but
brings
some
pretty
present
<EOS>
he
thinks
will
be
grateful
to
me
.
<EOS>
When
at
home
,
he
is
seldom
out
of
my
company
;
delights
to
teach
me
French
and
Italian
,
and
reads
me
pieces
of
manuscript
poetry
,
in
several
of
the
modern
tongues
(
for
he
speaks
them
all
)
;
explains
to
me
every
thing
I
understand
not
;
delights
to
answer
all
my
questions
,
and
to
encourage
my
inquisitiveness
and
curiosity
,
tries
to
give
me
a
notion
of
pictures
and
medals
,
and
reads
me
lectures
upon
them
,
for
he
has
a
fine
collection
of
both
;
and
every
now
<EOS>
and
then
will
have
it
,
that
he
has
been
improved
by
my
questions
and
observations
.
  
<EOS>
What
say
you
to
these
things
,
my
dear
?
<EOS>
Do
they
come
up
to
your
first
question
?
<EOS>
or
do
they
not
?
<EOS>
Or
is
not
what
I
have
said
,
a
full
answer
,
were
I
to
say
no
more
,
to
all
your
enquiries
?
  
<EOS>
O
<EOS>
my
dear
,
I
am
thoroughly
convinced
,
that
half
the
misunderstandings
,
among
married
people
,
are
owing
to
trifles
,
to
petty
distinctions
,
to
mere
words
,
and
little
captious
follies
,
to
over
-
weenings
,
or
unguarded
petulances
:
and
who
would
forego
the
solid
satisfaction
of
life
,
for
the
sake
of
triumphing
in
such
poor
contentions
,
if
one
could
triumph
?
  
<EOS>
But
you
next
require
of
me
an
instance
,
where
,
in
complaisance
to
my
will
,
he
has
receded
from
his
own
?
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
what
to
say
to
this
.
<EOS>
When
Mr.
B.
is
all
tenderness
and
indulgence
,
and
requires
of
me
nothing
,
that
I
can
have
a
material
objection
to
,
ought
I
not
to
oblige
him
?
<EOS>
Can
I
have
a
will
that
is
not
his
?
<EOS>
Or
would
it
be
excusable
if
I
had
?
<EOS>
All
little
matters
I
cheerfully
give
up
:
great
ones
have
not
yet
occurred
between
us
,
and
I
hope
never
will
.
<EOS>
One
point
,
indeed
,
I
have
some
apprehension
may
happen
;
and
that
,
to
be
plain
with
you
,
is
,
we
have
had
a
debate
or
two
on
the
subject
(
which
I
maintain
)
of
a
mother
's
duty
to
nurse
her
own
child
;
and
I
am
sorry
to
say
it
,
he
seems
more
determined
than
I
wish
he
were
,
against
it
.
  
<EOS>
I
hope
it
will
not
proceed
so
far
as
to
awaken
the
sleeping
dragon
I
mentioned
.
<EOS>
Prerogative
by
name
;
<EOS>
but
I
doubt
I
can
not
give
up
this
point
very
contentedly
.
<EOS>
But
as
to
lesser
points
,
had
I
been
a
duchess
born
,
I
think
I
would
not
have
contested
them
with
my
husband
.
  
<EOS>
I
could
give
you
many
respectful
instances
too
,
of
his
receding
,
when
he
has
desired
to
see
what
I
have
been
writing
,
and
I
have
told
him
to
whom
,
and
begged
to
be
excused
.
<EOS>
One
such
instance
I
can
give
since
I
began
this
letter
.
<EOS>
This
is
it
:
  
<EOS>
I
put
it
in
my
bosom
,
when
he
came
up
:
he
saw
me
do
so
:
  
"
Are
you
writing
,
my
dear
,
what
I
must
not
see
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
writing
to
Miss
Darnford
,
Sir
:
and
she
begged
you
might
not
at
present
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
This
augments
my
curiosity
,
Pamela
.
<EOS>
What
can
two
such
ladies
write
,
that
I
may
not
see
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
wo
n't
be
displeased
,
Sir
,
I
had
rather
you
would
not
,
because
she
desires
you
may
not
see
her
letter
,
nor
this
my
answer
,
till
the
letter
is
in
her
hands
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
I
will
not
,
"
returned
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
  
Will
this
instance
,
my
dear
,
come
up
to
your
demand
for
one
,
where
he
recedes
from
his
own
will
,
in
complaisance
to
mine
?
  
<EOS>
But
now
,
as
to
what
both
our
notions
and
our
practice
are
on
the
article
of
my
retirements
,
and
whether
he
breaks
in
upon
them
unceremoniously
,
and
without
apology
,
let
the
conversation
I
promised
inform
you
,
which
began
on
the
following
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
rode
out
early
one
morning
,
within
a
few
days
past
,
and
did
not
return
till
the
afternoon
;
an
absence
I
had
not
been
used
to
of
late
;
and
breakfasting
and
dining
without
him
being
also
a
new
thing
with
me
<EOS>
,
I
had
such
an
impatience
to
see
him
,
having
expected
him
at
dinner
,
that
I
was
forced
to
retire
to
my
closet
,
to
try
to
divert
it
,
by
writing
;
and
the
gloomy
conclusion
of
my
last
was
then
the
subject
.
<EOS>
He
returned
about
four
o'clock
,
and
indeed
did
not
tarry
to
change
his
riding
-
dress
,
as
your
politeness
,
my
dear
friend
,
would
perhaps
have
expected
;
but
came
directly
up
to
me
,
with
an
impatience
to
see
me
,
equal
to
my
own
,
when
he
was
told
,
upon
enquiry
,
that
I
was
in
my
closet
.
  
<EOS>
I
heard
his
welcome
step
,
as
he
came
up
stairs
;
which
generally
,
after
a
longer
absence
than
I
expect
,
has
such
an
effect
upon
my
fond
heart
,
that
it
gives
a
responsive
throb
for
every
step
he
takes
towards
me
,
and
beats
quicker
and
faster
,
as
he
comes
nearer
.
  
<EOS>
I
met
him
at
my
closet
door
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
So
,
my
dear
love
,
"
says
he
,
"
how
do
you
?
"
<EOS>
folding
his
kind
arms
about
me
,
and
saluting
me
with
ardour
.
<EOS>
"
Whenever
I
have
been
but
a
few
hours
from
you
,
my
impatience
to
see
my
beloved
,
will
not
permit
me
to
stand
upon
the
formality
of
a
message
to
know
how
you
are
engaged
;
but
I
break
in
upon
you
,
even
in
my
riding
-
dress
,
as
you
see
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Dear
Sir
,
you
are
very
obliging
.
<EOS>
But
I
have
no
notion
of
mere
formalities
of
this
kind
"
 
<EOS>
(
How
unpolite
this
,
my
dear
,
in
your
friend
?
)
 
<EOS>
"
in
a
married
state
,
since
'
tis
impossible
a
virtuous
wife
can
be
employed
about
any
thing
that
her
husband
may
not
know
,
and
so
need
not
fear
surprises
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
to
hear
you
say
this
,
my
Pamela
;
for
I
have
always
thought
the
extraordinary
civilities
and
distances
of
this
kind
which
I
have
observed
among
several
persons
of
rank
,
altogether
unaccountable
.
<EOS>
For
if
they
are
exacted
by
the
lady
,
I
should
suspect
she
had
reserves
,
which
she
herself
believed
I
could
not
approve
.
<EOS>
If
not
exacted
,
but
practised
of
choice
by
the
gentleman
,
it
carries
with
it
,
in
my
opinion
,
a
false
air
of
politeness
,
little
less
than
affrontive
to
the
lady
,
and
dishonourable
to
himself
;
for
does
it
not
look
as
if
he
supposed
,
and
allowed
,
that
she
might
be
so
employed
that
it
was
necessary
to
apprise
her
of
his
visit
,
lest
he
should
make
discoveries
not
to
her
credit
or
his
own
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
One
would
not
,
Sir
"
<EOS>
(
for
I
thought
his
conclusion
too
severe
)
,
"
make
such
a
harsh
supposition
as
this
neither
:
for
there
are
little
delicacies
and
moments
of
retirement
,
no
doubt
,
in
which
a
modest
lady
would
wish
to
be
indulged
by
the
tenderest
husband
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
may
be
so
in
an
early
matrimony
,
before
the
lady
's
confidence
in
the
honour
and
discretion
of
the
man
she
has
chosen
has
disengaged
her
from
her
bridal
reserves
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Bridal
reserves
,
dear
Sir
!
<EOS>
permit
me
to
give
it
as
my
humble
opinion
,
that
a
wife
's
behaviour
ought
to
be
as
pure
and
circumspect
,
in
degree
,
as
that
of
a
bride
,
or
even
of
a
maiden
lady
,
be
her
confidence
in
her
husband
's
honour
and
discretion
ever
so
great
.
<EOS>
For
,
indeed
,
I
think
a
gross
or
a
careless
demeanour
<EOS>
little
becomes
that
modesty
which
is
the
peculiar
excellency
and
distinction
of
our
sex
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
account
very
well
,
my
dear
,
by
what
you
now
say
for
your
own
over
-
nice
behaviour
,
as
I
have
sometimes
thought
it
.
<EOS>
But
are
we
not
all
apt
to
argue
for
a
practice
we
make
our
own
,
because
we
do
make
it
our
own
,
rather
than
from
the
reason
of
the
thing
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
,
Sir
,
that
is
not
the
present
case
with
me
;
for
,
permit
me
to
say
,
that
an
over
-
free
or
negligent
behaviour
of
a
lady
in
the
married
state
,
must
be
a
mark
of
disrespect
to
her
consort
,
and
would
shew
as
if
she
was
very
little
solicitous
about
what
appearance
she
made
in
his
eye
.
<EOS>
And
must
not
this
beget
in
him
a
slight
opinion
of
her
sex
too
,
as
if
,
supposing
the
gentleman
had
been
a
free
liver
,
she
would
convince
him
there
was
no
other
difference
in
the
sex
,
but
as
they
were
within
or
without
the
pale
,
licensed
by
the
law
,
or
acting
in
defiance
of
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
understand
the
force
of
your
argument
,
Pamela
.
<EOS>
But
you
were
going
to
say
something
more
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Only
,
Sir
,
permit
me
to
add
,
that
when
,
in
my
particular
case
,
you
enjoin
me
to
appear
before
you
always
dressed
,
even
in
the
early
part
of
the
day
,
it
would
be
wrong
,
if
I
was
less
regardful
of
my
behaviour
and
actions
,
than
of
my
appearance
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
you
are
right
,
<EOS>
my
dear
,
if
a
precise
or
unnecessary
scrupulousness
be
avoided
,
and
where
all
is
unaffected
,
easy
,
and
natural
,
as
in
my
Pamela
.
<EOS>
For
I
have
seen
married
ladies
,
both
in
England
and
France
,
who
have
kept
a
husband
at
a
greater
distance
than
they
have
exacted
from
some
of
his
sex
,
who
have
been
more
entitled
to
his
resentment
,
than
to
his
wife
's
intimacies
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
to
wave
a
subject
,
in
which
,
as
I
can
with
pleasure
say
,
neither
of
us
have
much
concern
,
tell
me
,
my
dearest
,
how
you
were
employed
before
I
came
up
?
<EOS>
Here
are
pen
and
ink
:
here
,
too
,
is
paper
,
but
it
is
as
spotless
as
your
mind
.
<EOS>
To
whom
were
you
directing
your
favours
now
?
<EOS>
May
I
not
know
your
subject
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
H.
's
letter
was
a
part
of
it
;
and
so
I
had
put
it
by
,
at
his
approach
,
and
not
choosing
he
should
see
that
 
"
I
am
writing
,
"
replied
I
,
"
to
Miss
Darnford
:
<EOS>
but
I
think
you
must
not
ask
me
to
see
what
I
have
written
this
time
.
<EOS>
I
put
it
aside
that
you
should
not
,
when
I
heard
your
welcome
step
.
<EOS>
The
subject
is
our
parting
with
our
noble
guests
;
and
a
little
of
my
apprehensiveness
,
on
an
occasion
upon
which
our
sex
may
write
to
one
another
;
but
,
for
some
of
the
reasons
we
have
been
mentioning
,
gentlemen
should
not
desire
to
see
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
I
will
not
,
my
dearest
love
.
"
<EOS>
(
So
here
,
my
dear
,
is
another
instance
 
<EOS>
I
could
give
you
an
hundred
<EOS>
such
 
of
his
receding
from
his
own
will
,
in
complaisance
to
mine
.
)
<EOS>
"
Only
,
"
continued
he
,
"
let
me
warn
you
against
too
much
apprehensiveness
,
for
your
own
sake
,
as
well
as
mine
;
for
such
a
mind
as
my
Pamela
's
I
can
not
permit
to
be
habitually
over
-
clouded
.
<EOS>
And
yet
there
now
hangs
upon
your
brow
an
over
-
thoughtfulness
,
which
you
must
not
indulge
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
,
Sir
,
I
was
a
little
too
thoughtful
,
from
my
subject
,
before
you
came
;
but
your
presence
,
like
the
sun
,
has
dissipated
the
mists
that
hung
upon
my
mind
.
<EOS>
See
you
not
,
"
and
I
pressed
his
hand
with
my
lips
,
"
they
are
all
gone
already
?
"
<EOS>
smiling
upon
him
with
a
delight
unfeigned
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
quite
,
my
dearest
Pamela
;
and
therefore
,
if
you
have
no
objection
,
I
will
change
my
dress
,
and
attend
you
in
the
chariot
for
an
hour
or
two
,
whither
you
please
,
that
not
one
shadow
may
remain
visible
in
this
dear
face
;
"
tenderly
saluting
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
Whithersoever
you
please
,
Sir
.
<EOS>
A
little
airing
with
you
will
be
highly
agreeable
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
dear
obliger
went
and
changed
his
dress
in
an
instant
;
and
he
led
me
to
the
chariot
,
with
his
usual
tender
politeness
,
and
we
had
a
charming
airing
of
several
miles
;
returning
quite
happy
,
cheerful
,
and
delighted
with
each
other
's
conversation
,
without
calling
in
upon
any
of
our
good
neighbours
:
for
what
need
of
that
,
my
dear
,
when
we
could
be
the
best
company
in
the
world
to
each
other
?
  
<EOS>
Do
these
instances
come
up
to
your
questions
,
my
dear
?
<EOS>
or
,
do
they
not
?
 
<EOS>
If
you
think
not
,
I
could
give
you
our
conversation
in
the
chariot
:
for
I
wrote
it
down
at
my
first
leisure
,
so
highly
was
I
delighted
with
it
;
for
the
subject
was
my
dearest
parents
;
a
subject
started
by
himself
,
because
he
knew
it
would
oblige
me
.
<EOS>
But
being
tired
with
writing
,
I
may
reserve
it
,
till
I
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
,
if
you
think
it
worth
asking
for
.
<EOS>
And
so
I
will
hasten
to
a
conclusion
of
this
long
letter
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
only
farther
to
add
,
for
my
comfort
,
that
next
Thursday
se'n
-
night
,
if
nothing
hinders
,
we
are
to
set
out
for
London
.
<EOS>
And
why
do
you
think
I
say
for
my
comfort
?
<EOS>
Only
that
I
shall
then
soon
have
the
opportunity
,
to
assure
you
personally
,
as
you
give
me
hope
,
how
much
I
am
,
my
dear
Miss
Darnford
,
your
truly
affectionate
.
<EOS>
P.B.
    
<EOS>
My
dear
Miss
Darnford
,
  
One
more
letter
,
and
I
have
done
for
a
great
while
,
because
I
hope
your
presence
will
put
an
end
to
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
I
shall
now
tell
you
of
my
second
visit
to
the
dairy
-
house
,
where
we
went
to
breakfast
,
in
the
chariot
and
four
,
because
of
the
distance
,
which
is
ten
pretty
long
miles
.
  
<EOS>
I
transcribed
for
you
,
from
letters
written
formerly
to
my
dear
parents
,
an
account
of
my
former
dairy
-
house
visit
,
and
what
the
people
were
,
and
whom
I
saw
there
;
and
although
I
besought
you
to
keep
that
affair
to
yourself
,
as
too
much
affecting
the
reputation
of
my
Mr.
B.
to
be
known
any
farther
,
and
even
to
destroy
that
account
,
when
you
had
perused
it
;
yet
,
I
make
no
doubt
,
you
remember
the
story
,
and
so
I
need
not
repeat
any
part
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
When
we
arrived
there
,
we
found
at
the
door
,
expecting
us
(
for
they
heard
the
chariot
-
wheels
at
a
distance
)
,
my
pretty
Miss
Goodwin
,
and
two
other
Misses
,
who
had
earned
their
ride
,
attended
by
the
governess
's
daughter
,
a
discreet
young
gentlewoman
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
I
stepped
out
,
the
child
ran
into
my
arms
with
great
eagerness
,
and
I
as
tenderly
embraced
her
,
and
leading
her
into
the
parlour
,
asked
her
abundance
of
questions
about
her
work
,
and
her
lessons
;
and
among
the
rest
if
she
had
merited
this
distinction
of
the
chaise
and
dairy
-
house
breakfast
,
or
if
it
was
owing
to
her
uncle
's
favour
,
and
to
that
of
her
governess
?
<EOS>
The
young
gentlewoman
assured
me
it
was
to
both
,
and
shewed
me
her
needleworks
,
and
penmanship
;
and
the
child
was
highly
pleased
with
my
commendations
.
  
<EOS>
I
took
a
good
deal
of
notice
of
the
other
two
Misses
,
for
their
school
-
fellow
's
sake
,
and
made
each
of
them
a
present
of
some
little
toys
;
and
my
Miss
,
of
a
number
of
pretty
trinkets
,
with
which
she
was
highly
delighted
;
and
I
told
her
,
that
I
would
wait
upon
her
governess
,
when
I
came
from
London
into
the
country
again
,
and
see
in
what
order
she
kept
her
little
matters
;
for
,
above
all
things
,
I
love
pretty
house
-
wifely
Misses
;
and
then
,
I
would
bring
her
more
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
observed
,
with
no
small
satisfaction
,
the
child
's
behaviour
,
which
is
very
pretty
;
and
appeared
as
fond
of
her
,
as
if
he
had
been
more
than
her
uncle
,
and
yet
seemed
under
some
restraint
,
lest
it
should
be
taken
,
that
he
was
more
.
<EOS>
Such
power
has
secret
guilt
,
poor
gentleman
!
<EOS>
to
lessen
and
restrain
a
pleasure
,
that
would
,
in
a
happier
light
,
have
been
so
laudable
to
have
manifested
!
  
<EOS>
I
am
going
to
let
you
into
a
charming
scene
,
resulting
from
this
perplexity
of
the
dear
gentleman
.
<EOS>
A
scene
that
has
afforded
me
high
delight
ever
since
;
and
always
will
,
when
I
think
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
The
child
was
very
fond
of
her
uncle
,
and
told
him
she
loved
him
dearly
,
and
always
would
love
and
honour
him
,
for
giving
her
such
a
good
aunt
.
<EOS>
"
You
talked
,
Madam
,
"
said
she
,
"
when
I
saw
you
before
,
that
I
should
come
and
live
with
you
 
<EOS>
Will
you
let
me
,
Madam
?
<EOS>
Indeed
I
will
be
very
good
,
and
do
every
thing
you
bid
me
,
and
mind
my
book
,
and
my
needle
;
indeed
I
will
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ask
your
uncle
,
my
dear
,
"
said
I
;
"
I
should
like
your
pretty
company
of
all
things
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
went
to
Mr.
B.
and
said
,
"
Shall
I
,
Sir
,
go
and
live
with
my
aunt
?
 
<EOS>
Pray
let
me
,
when
you
come
from
London
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
a
very
good
governess
,
child
,
"
said
he
;
"
and
she
ca
n't
part
with
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
but
she
can
.
<EOS>
Sir
;
she
has
a
great
many
Misses
,
and
can
spare
me
well
enough
;
and
if
you
please
to
let
me
ride
in
your
coach
sometimes
,
I
can
go
and
visit
my
governess
,
and
beg
a
holiday
for
the
Misses
,
now
-
and
-
then
,
when
I
am
almost
a
woman
,
and
then
all
the
Misses
will
love
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
the
Misses
love
you
now
,
Miss
Goodwin
?
"
said
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
they
love
me
well
enough
,
for
matter
of
that
;
but
they
'll
love
me
better
,
when
I
can
beg
them
a
holiday
.
<EOS>
Do
,
dear
Sir
,
let
me
go
home
to
my
new
aunt
,
next
time
you
come
into
the
country
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
was
much
pleased
with
the
dear
child
's
earnestness
;
and
permitted
her
to
have
her
full
argument
with
her
beloved
uncle
;
but
was
much
moved
,
and
he
himself
was
under
some
concern
,
when
she
said
,
"
But
you
should
,
in
pity
,
let
me
live
with
you
,
Sir
,
for
I
have
no
papa
,
nor
mamma
<EOS>
neither
:
they
are
so
far
off
!
 
<EOS>
But
I
will
love
you
both
as
if
you
were
my
own
papa
and
mamma
;
so
,
dear
now
,
<EOS>
my
good
uncle
,
promise
the
poor
girl
that
has
never
a
papa
nor
mamma

<EOS>
I
withdrew
to
the
door
:
"
It
will
rain
,
I
believe
,
"
said
I
,
and
looked
up
.
<EOS>
And
,
indeed
,
I
had
almost
a
shower
in
my
eye
:
and
had
I
kept
my
place
,
could
not
have
refrained
shewing
how
much
I
was
affected
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
,
as
I
said
,
was
a
little
moved
;
but
for
fear
the
young
gentlewoman
should
take
notice
of
it
 
"
<EOS>
How
!
<EOS>
my
dear
,
"
said
he
,
"
no
papa
and
mamma
!
 
<EOS>
Did
they
not
send
you
a
pretty
black
boy
to
wait
upon
you
,
a
while
ago
?
<EOS>
Have
you
forgot
that
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
true
,
"
replied
she
:
"
<EOS>
but
what
's
a
black
boy
to
living
with
my
new
aunt
?
 
<EOS>
That
's
better
a
great
deal
than
a
black
boy
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
your
aunt
and
I
will
consider
of
it
,
when
we
come
from
London
.
<EOS>
Be
a
good
girl
,
meantime
,
and
do
as
your
governess
would
have
you
,
and
then
you
do
n't
know
what
we
may
do
for
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
then
,
Miss
,
"
said
she
to
her
young
governess
,
"
let
me
be
set
two
tasks
instead
of
one
,
and
I
will
learn
all
I
can
to
deserve
to
go
to
my
aunt
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
In
this
manner
the
little
prattler
diverted
herself
.
<EOS>
And
as
we
returned
from
them
,
the
scene
I
hinted
at
,
opened
as
follows
:
  
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
was
pleased
to
say
,
"
What
a
poor
figure
does
the
proudest
man
make
,
<EOS>
my
dear
Pamela
,
under
the
sense
of
a
concealed
guilt
,
in
company
of
the
innocent
who
know
it
,
and
even
of
those
who
do
not
!
 
<EOS>
Since
the
casual
expression
of
a
baby
shall
overwhelm
him
with
shame
,
and
make
him
unable
to
look
up
without
confusion
.
<EOS>
I
blushed
for
myself
,
"
continued
he
,
"
to
see
how
you
were
affected
for
me
,
and
yet
withdrew
,
to
avoid
reproaching
me
so
much
as
with
a
look
.
<EOS>
Surely
,
Pamela
,
I
must
then
make
a
most
contemptible
appearance
in
your
eye
!
<EOS>
Did
you
not
disdain
me
at
that
moment
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Dearest
Sir
!
<EOS>
how
can
you
speak
such
a
word
?
<EOS>
A
word
I
can
not
repeat
after
you
!
<EOS>
For
at
that
very
time
,
I
beheld
you
with
the
more
reverence
,
for
seeing
your
noble
heart
touched
with
a
sense
of
your
error
;
and
it
was
such
an
earnest
to
me
of
the
happiest
change
I
could
ever
wish
for
,
and
in
so
young
a
gentleman
,
that
it
was
one
half
joy
for
that
,
and
the
other
half
concern
at
the
little
charmer
's
accidental
plea
,
to
her
best
and
nearest
friend
,
for
coming
home
to
her
new
aunt
,
that
affected
me
so
sensibly
as
you
saw
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
not
talk
to
me
of
the
child
's
coming
home
,
after
this
visit
,
Pamela
;
for
how
,
at
this
rate
,
shall
I
stand
the
reproaches
of
my
own
mind
,
when
I
see
the
little
prater
every
day
before
me
,
and
think
of
what
her
poor
mamma
has
suffered
on
my
account
!
'
<EOS>
Tis
enough
,
that
in
you
,
my
dear
,
I
have
an
hourly
reproach
before
me
,
for
my
attempts
on
your
virtue
;
and
I
have
nothing
to
boast
of
,
but
that
I
gave
way
to
the
triumphs
of
your
innocence
:
and
what
then
is
my
boast
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
your
boast
,
dearest
Sir
?
<EOS>
You
have
everything
to
boast
,
that
is
worthy
of
being
boasted
of
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
the
best
of
husbands
,
the
best
of
landlords
,
the
best
of
masters
,
the
best
of
friends
;
and
,
with
all
these
excellencies
,
and
a
mind
,
as
I
hope
,
continually
improving
,
and
more
and
more
affected
with
the
sense
of
its
past
mistakes
,
will
you
ask
,
dear
Sir
,
what
is
your
boast
?
  
<EOS>
"
O
my
dearest
,
dear
Mr.
B.
,
"
and
then
I
pressed
his
hands
with
my
lips
,
"
whatever
you
are
to
yourself
,
when
you
give
way
to
reflections
so
hopeful
<EOS>
,
you
are
the
glory
and
the
boast
of
your
grateful
Pamela
!
<EOS>
And
permit
me
to
add
,
"
tears
standing
in
my
eyes
,
and
holding
his
hand
between
mine
,
"
that
I
never
beheld
you
in
my
life
,
in
a
more
amiable
light
,
than
when
I
saw
that
noble
consciousness
which
you
speak
of
,
manifest
itself
in
your
eyes
,
and
your
countenance
 
<EOS>
O
Sir
!
<EOS>
this
was
a
sight
of
joy
,
of
true
joy
!
<EOS>
to
one
who
loves
you
for
your
dear
soul
's
sake
,
as
well
as
for
that
of
your
person
;
and
who
looks
forward
to
a
companionship
with
you
beyond
the
term
of
this
transitory
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Putting
my
arms
round
his
arms
,
as
I
sat
,
my
fearful
eye
watching
his
,
"
I
fear
.
<EOS>
Sir
,
I
have
been
too
serious
!
<EOS>
I
have
,
perhaps
,
broken
one
of
your
injunctions
!
<EOS>
Have
cast
a
gloominess
over
your
mind
!
<EOS>
And
if
I
have
,
dear
Sir
,
forgive
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
clasped
his
arms
around
me
:
"
O
my
beloved
Pamela
,
"
said
he
;
"
thou
dear
confirmer
of
all
my
better
purposes
!
<EOS>
How
shall
I
acknowledge
your
inexpressible
goodness
to
me
?
<EOS>
I
see
every
day
more
and
more
,
my
dear
love
,
what
confidence
I
may
repose
in
your
generosity
and
discretion
!
<EOS>
You
want
no
forgiveness
;
and
my
silence
was
owing
to
much
better
motives
than
to
those
you
were
apprehensive
of
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
saw
my
grateful
transport
,
and
kindly
said
,
"
Struggle
not
,
my
beloved
Pamela
,
for
words
to
express
sentiments
which
your
eyes
and
your
countenance
much
more
significantly
express
than
any
words
can
do
.
<EOS>
Every
day
produces
new
instances
of
your
affectionate
concern
for
my
future
as
well
as
present
happiness
:
and
I
will
endeavour
to
confirm
to
you
all
the
hopes
which
the
present
occasion
has
given
you
of
me
,
and
which
I
see
by
these
transporting
effects
are
so
desirable
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
chariot
brought
us
home
sooner
than
I
wished
,
and
Mr.
B.
handed
me
into
the
parlour
.
  
<EOS>
"
Here
,
Mrs.
Jervis
,
"
said
he
,
meeting
her
in
the
passage
,
"
receive
your
angelic
lady
.
<EOS>
I
must
take
a
little
tour
without
you
,
Pamela
;
for
I
have
had
too
much
of
your
dear
company
,
and
must
leave
you
,
to
descend
again
into
myself
;
for
you
have
raised
me
to
such
a
height
,
that
it
is
with
pain
<EOS>
I
look
down
from
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
kissed
my
hand
,
and
went
into
his
chariot
again
;
for
it
was
but
half
an
hour
after
twelve
;
and
said
he
would
be
back
by
two
at
dinner
.
<EOS>
He
left
Mrs.
Jervis
wondering
at
his
words
,
and
at
the
solemn
air
with
which
he
uttered
them
.
<EOS>
But
when
I
told
that
good
friend
the
occasion
,
I
had
a
new
joy
in
the
pleasure
and
gratulations
of
the
dear
good
woman
,
on
what
had
passed
.
  
<EOS>
My
next
letter
will
be
from
London
,
and
to
you
,
my
honoured
parents
;
for
to
you
,
my
dear
,
I
shall
not
write
again
,
expecting
to
see
you
soon
.
<EOS>
But
I
must
now
write
seldomer
,
because
I
am
to
renew
my
correspondence
with
Lady
Davers
;
with
whom
I
can
not
be
so
free
,
as
I
have
been
with
Miss
Darnford
;
and
<EOS>
so
I
doubt
,
my
dear
father
and
mother
,
you
can
not
have
the
particulars
of
that
correspondence
;
for
I
shall
never
find
time
to
transcribe
.
  
<EOS>
But
every
opportunity
that
offers
,
you
may
assure
yourselves
,
shall
be
laid
hold
of
by
your
ever
-
dutiful
daughter
.
  
<EOS>
And
now
,
my
dear
Miss
Darnford
,
as
I
inscribed
this
letter
to
you
,
let
me
conclude
it
,
with
the
assurance
,
that
I
am
,
and
ever
will
be
your
most
affectionate
friend
and
servant
,
P.B.
    
MY
DEAR
FATHER
AND
MOTHER
,
  
<EOS>
I
know
you
will
be
pleased
to
hear
that
we
arrived
safely
in
town
last
night
.
<EOS>
We
found
a
stately
,
well
-
furnished
,
and
convenient
house
;
and
I
had
my
closet
,
or
library
,
and
my
withdrawing
room
,
all
in
complete
order
,
which
Mr.
B.
gave
me
possession
of
in
the
most
obliging
manner
.
  
<EOS>
I
am
in
a
new
world
,
as
I
may
say
,
and
see
such
vast
piles
of
building
,
and
such
a
concourse
of
people
,
and
hear
such
a
rattling
of
coaches
in
the
day
,
that
I
hardly
know
what
to
make
of
it
,
as
yet
.
<EOS>
Then
the
nightly
watch
,
going
their
hourly
rounds
,
disturbed
me
.
<EOS>
But
I
shall
soon
be
used
to
that
,
and
sleep
the
sounder
,
perhaps
,
for
the
security
it
assures
to
us
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
is
impatient
to
shew
me
what
is
curious
in
and
about
this
vast
city
,
and
to
hear
,
as
he
is
pleased
to
say
,
my
observations
upon
what
I
shall
see
.
<EOS>
He
has
carried
me
through
several
of
the
fine
streets
this
day
in
his
chariot
;
but
,
at
present
,
I
have
too
confused
a
notion
of
things
,
to
give
any
account
of
them
:
nor
shall
I
trouble
you
with
descriptions
of
that
kind
;
for
you
being
within
a
day
's
journey
of
London
,
I
hope
for
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
oftener
than
I
could
expect
before
;
and
shall
therefore
leave
these
matters
to
your
own
observations
,
and
what
you
'll
hear
from
others
.
  
<EOS>
I
am
impatient
for
the
arrival
of
my
dear
Miss
Darnford
,
whose
company
and
conversation
will
reconcile
me
,
in
a
great
measure
,
to
this
new
world
.
  
<EOS>
Our
family
at
present
are
Colbrand
,
Jonathan
,
and
six
men
servants
,
including
the
coachman
.
<EOS>
The
four
maids
are
also
with
us
.
  
<EOS>
But
my
good
Mrs.
Jervis
was
indisposed
;
so
came
not
up
with
us
;
but
we
expect
her
and
Mr.
Longman
in
a
day
or
two
:
for
Mr.
B.
has
given
her
to
my
wishes
;
and
as
Mr.
Longman
's
business
will
require
him
to
be
up
and
down
frequently
,
Mrs.
Jervis
's
care
will
be
the
better
dispensed
with
.
<EOS>
I
long
to
see
the
dear
good
woman
,
and
shall
be
more
in
my
element
when
I
do
.
  
<EOS>
Then
I
have
,
besides
,
<EOS>
my
penitent
Polly
Barlow
,
who
has
never
held
up
her
head
since
that
deplorable
instance
of
her
weakness
,
which
I
mentioned
to
you
and
to
Miss
Darnford
,
yet
am
I
as
kind
to
her
as
if
nothing
bad
happened
.
<EOS>
I
wish
,
however
,
some
good
husband
would
offer
for
her
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Adams
,
our
worthy
chaplain
,
is
now
with
Mr.
Williams
.
<EOS>
He
purposes
to
give
us
his
company
here
till
Christmas
,
when
probably
matters
will
be
adjusted
for
him
to
take
possession
of
his
living
.
<EOS>
Meantime
,
not
to
let
fall
a
good
custom
,
when
perhaps
we
have
most
occasion
for
it
,
I
make
Jonathan
,
who
is
reverend
by
his
years
and
silver
hairs
,
supply
his
place
,
appointing
him
the
prayers
he
is
to
read
.
  
<EOS>
God
preserve
you
both
in
health
,
and
continue
to
me
,
I
beseech
you
,
your
prayers
and
blessings
,
concludes
your
ever
dutiful
daughter
,
P.
B.
    
<EOS>
From
Mrs.
B.
to
Lady
Davers
.
  
<EOS>
My
Dearest
Lady
,
  
<EOS>
I
must
beg
pardon
,
for
having
been
in
this
great
town
more
than
a
week
,
and
not
having
found
an
opportunity
to
tender
my
devoirs
to
your
ladyship
.
<EOS>
You
know
,
dear
Madam
,
what
hurries
and
fatigues
must
attend
such
a
journey
,
to
one
in
my
way
,
and
to
an
entire
new
settlement
in
which
an
hundred
things
must
be
done
,
and
attended
to
,
with
a
preference
to
other
occasions
,
however
delightful
.
<EOS>
Yet
,
I
must
own
,
we
found
a
stately
,
well
-
ordered
,
and
convenient
house
:
<EOS>
but
,
although
it
is
not
far
from
the
fields
,
and
has
an
airy
opening
to
its
back
part
,
and
its
front
to
a
square
,
as
it
is
called
,
yet
I
am
not
reconciled
to
it
,
so
entirely
as
to
the
beloved
mansion
we
left
.
  
<EOS>
My
dear
Mr.
B.
has
been
,
and
is
,
busily
employed
in
ordering
some
few
alterations
,
to
make
things
still
more
commodious
.
<EOS>
He
has
furnished
me
out
a
pretty
library
;
and
has
allotted
me
very
convenient
apartments
besides
:
<EOS>
the
furniture
of
every
place
is
rich
,
as
befits
the
mind
and
fortune
of
the
generous
owner
.
<EOS>
But
I
shall
not
offer
at
particulars
,
as
we
hope
to
have
the
honour
of
a
visit
from
my
good
lord
,
and
your
ladyship
,
before
the
winter
weather
sets
in
,
to
make
the
roads
too
dirty
and
deep
:
but
it
is
proper
to
mention
,
that
the
house
is
so
large
,
that
we
can
make
a
great
number
of
beds
,
the
more
conveniently
to
receive
the
honours
of
your
ladyship
,
and
my
lord
,
and
Mr.
B.
's
other
friends
will
do
us
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
not
yet
been
at
any
of
the
public
diversions
.
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
has
carried
me
,
by
gentle
turns
,
out
of
his
workmen
's
way
,
ten
miles
round
this
overgrown
capital
,
and
through
the
principal
of
its
numerous
streets
.
<EOS>
The
villages
that
lie
spangled
about
this
vast
circumference
,
as
well
on
the
other
side
the
noble
Thames
(
which
I
had
before
a
notion
of
,
from
Sir
John
Denham
's
celebrated
Cooper
's
Hill
)
,
as
on
the
Middlesex
side
,
are
beautiful
,
both
by
buildings
and
situation
,
beyond
what
I
had
imagined
,
and
several
of
them
seem
larger
than
many
of
our
country
towns
of
note
.
<EOS>
But
it
would
be
impertinent
to
trouble
your
ladyship
with
these
matters
,
who
are
no
stranger
to
what
is
worthy
of
notice
in
London
.
<EOS>
But
I
was
surprised
,
when
Mr.
B.
observed
to
me
,
that
this
whole
county
,
and
the
two
cities
of
London
and
Westminster
,
are
represented
in
parliament
by
no
more
than
eight
members
,
when
so
many
borough
towns
in
England
are
inferior
to
the
meanest
villages
about
London
.
  
<EOS>
I
am
in
daily
expectation
of
the
arrival
of
Miss
Darnford
,
and
then
I
shall
wish
(
accompanied
by
a
young
lady
of
so
polite
a
taste
)
to
see
a
good
play
.
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
has
already
shewn
me
the
opera
-
house
,
and
the
play
-
houses
,
though
silent
,
as
I
may
say
;
that
,
as
he
was
pleased
to
observe
,
they
should
not
be
new
to
me
,
and
that
the
sight
might
not
take
off
my
attention
from
the
performance
,
when
I
went
to
the
play
;
so
that
I
can
conceive
a
tolerable
notion
of
every
thing
,
from
the
disposition
of
the
seats
,
the
boxes
,
galleries
,
pit
,
the
music
,
scenes
,
and
the
stage
;
and
so
shall
have
no
occasion
to
gaze
about
me
,
like
a
country
novice
,
whereby
I
might
attract
a
notice
that
I
would
not
wish
,
either
for
my
own
credit
,
or
your
dear
brother
's
honour
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
had
a
pleasure
which
I
had
not
in
Bedfordshire
;
and
that
is
,
that
on
Sunday
I
was
at
church
,
without
gaping
crowds
to
attend
us
,
and
blessings
too
loud
for
my
wishes
.
<EOS>
Yet
I
was
more
gazed
at
(
and
so
was
Mr.
B.
)
than
I
expected
,
considering
there
were
so
many
well
-
dressed
gentry
,
and
some
nobility
there
,
and
they
stared
as
much
as
any
body
,
but
will
not
,
I
hope
,
when
we
cease
to
be
a
novelty
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
already
had
several
visitors
to
welcome
Mr.
B.
to
town
,
and
to
congratulate
him
on
his
marriage
;
but
some
,
no
doubt
,
to
see
,
and
to
find
fault
with
his
rustic
;
for
it
is
impossible
,
you
know
,
Madam
,
that
a
gentleman
so
distinguished
by
his
merit
and
fortune
should
have
taken
a
step
of
such
consequence
to
himself
and
family
,
and
not
to
have
been
known
by
every
body
so
to
have
done
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Thomas
Atkyns
is
in
town
,
and
has
taken
apartments
in
Hanover
Square
;
and
he
brought
with
him
a
younger
brother
of
Mr.
Arthur
's
,
who
,
it
seems
,
is
a
merchant
.
  
<EOS>
Lord
F.
has
also
been
to
pay
his
respects
to
Mr.
B.
whose
school
fellow
<EOS>
he
was
at
Eton
,
<EOS>
the
little
time
Mr.
B.
was
there
.
<EOS>
His
lordship
promises
,
that
his
lady
shall
make
me
a
visit
,
and
accompany
me
to
the
opera
,
as
soon
as
we
are
fully
settled

A
gentleman
of
the
Temple
,
Mr.
Turner
by
name
,
and
Mr.
Fanshow
of
Gray
's
Inn
,
both
lawyers
,
and
of
Mr.
B.
's
former
acquaintance
,
very
sprightly
and
modish
gentlemen
,
have
also
welcomed
us
to
town
,
and
made
Mr.
B.
abundance
of
gay
compliments
on
my
account
to
my
face
,
all
in
the
common
frothy
run
.
  
<EOS>
They
may
be
polite
gentlemen
,
but
I
ca
n't
say
I
over
-
much
like
them
.
<EOS>
There
is
something
so
opiniated
,
so
seemingly
insensible
of
rebuke
,
either
from
within
or
without
,
and
yet
not
promising
to
avoid
deserving
one
occasionally
,
that
I
could
as
lieve
wish
Mr.
B.
<EOS>
and
they
would
not
renew
their
former
acquaintance
.
  
<EOS>
I
am
very
bold
<EOS>
your
ladyship
will
say
 
<EOS>
But
you
command
me
to
write
freely
:
yet
I
would
not
be
thought
to
be
uneasy
,
with
regard
to
your
dear
brother
's
morals
,
from
these
gentlemen
;
for
,
oh
,
Madam
,
I
am
a
blessed
creature
,
and
am
hourly
happier
and
happier
in
the
confidence
I
have
as
to
that
particular
:
<EOS>
but
I
imagine
they
will
force
themselves
upon
him
,
more
than
he
may
wish
,
or
would
permit
,
<EOS>
were
the
acquaintance
now
to
begin
;
for
they
are
not
of
his
turn
of
mind
,
as
it
seems
to
me
;
being
,
by
a
sentence
or
two
<EOS>
that
dropt
from
them
,
very
free
,
and
very
frothy
in
their
conversation
;
and
by
their
laughing
at
what
they
say
themselves
,
taking
that
for
wit
which
will
not
stand
the
test
,
if
I
may
be
allowed
to
say
so
.
  
<EOS>
But
they
have
heard
,
<EOS>
no
doubt
,
what
a
person
Mr.
B.
's
goodness
to
me
has
lifted
into
notice
;
and
they
think
themselves
warranted
to
say
any
thing
before
his
country
girl
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
pleased
to
ask
me
,
when
they
were
gone
,
how
I
liked
his
two
lawyers
?
<EOS>
And
said
,
they
were
persons
of
family
and
fortune
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
of
it
,
Sir
,
"
said
I
;
"
for
their
own
sakes
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
you
do
n't
approve
of
them
,
Pamela
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
are
your
friends
,
Sir
;
and
I
can
not
have
any
dislike
to
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
say
good
things
sometimes
,
"
returned
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
doubt
it
,
Sir
;
but
you
say
good
things
always
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
'
Tis
happy
for
me
,
my
dear
,
you
think
so
.
<EOS>
But
tell
me
,
what
you
think
of
'
em
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
better
able
,
Sir
,
to
answer
your
questions
,
if
I
see
them
a
second
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
we
form
notions
of
persons
at
first
sight
,
sometimes
,
my
dear
;
and
you
are
seldom
mistaken
in
yours
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
only
think
.
<EOS>
Sir
,
that
they
have
neither
of
them
any
diffidence
:
but
their
profession
,
perhaps
,
may
set
them
above
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
do
n't
practise
,
my
dear
;
their
fortunes
enable
them
to
live
without
it
;
and
they
are
too
studious
of
their
pleasures
,
to
give
themselves
any
trouble
they
are
not
obliged
to
take
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
seem
to
me
.
<EOS>
Sir
,
qualified
for
practice
:
they
would
make
great
figures
at
the
bar
,
I
fancy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
so
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Only
,
because
they
seem
prepared
to
think
well
of
what
they
say
themselves
;
and
lightly
of
what
other
people
say
,
or
may
think
,
of
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
,
indeed
,
my
dear
,
is
the
necessary
qualifications
of
a
public
speaker
,
be
he
lawyer
,
or
what
he
will
:
the
man
who
can
not
doubt
himself
,
and
can
think
meanly
of
his
auditors
,
never
fails
to
speak
with
self
-
applause
at
least
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
'll
pardon
me
,
good
Sir
,
for
speaking
my
mind
so
freely
,
and
so
early
of
these
your
friends
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
,
my
love
,
ask
you
a
question
,
I
wish
you
not
to
answer
;
and
always
expect
your
answer
should
be
without
reserve
;
for
many
times
I
may
ask
your
opinion
,
as
a
corrective
or
a
confirmation
of
my
own
judgment
.
"
  
<EOS>
How
kind
,
how
indulgent
was
this
,
my
good
lady
!
<EOS>
But
you
know
,
how
generously
your
dear
brother
treats
me
,
on
all
occasions
;
and
this
makes
me
so
bold
as
I
often
am
.
  
<EOS>
It
may
be
necessary
,
my
dear
lady
,
to
give
you
an
account
of
our
visitors
,
in
order
to
make
the
future
parts
of
my
writing
the
more
intelligible
;
because
what
I
have
to
write
may
turn
sometimes
upon
the
company
we
see
:
for
which
reason
,
I
shall
also
just
mention
<EOS>
Sir
George
Stuart
,
a
Scottish
gentleman
,
with
whom
Mr.
B.
became
acquainted
in
his
travels
,
who
seems
to
be
a
polite
(
and
Mr.
B.
says
,
is
a
learned
)
man
,
and
a
virtuoso
:
he
,
and
a
nephew
of
his
,
of
the
same
name
,
a
bashful
gentleman
,
and
who
,
for
that
reason
,
I
imagine
,
has
a
merit
that
lies
deeper
than
a
first
observation
can
reach
,
are
just
gone
from
us
,
and
were
received
with
so
much
civility
by
Mr.
B.
as
entitles
them
to
my
respectful
regard
.
  
<EOS>
Thus
,
Madam
,
do
I
run
on
,
in
a
manner
,
without
materials
;
and
only
to
shew
you
the
pleasure
<EOS>
I
take
in
obeying
you
.
<EOS>
I
hope
my
good
Lord
Davers
enjoys
his
health
,
and
continues
me
in
his
favour
;
which
I
value
extremely
,
as
well
as
your
ladyship
's
.
<EOS>
Mr.
H.
,
I
hope
,
likewise
enjoys
his
health
.
<EOS>
But
let
me
not
forget
my
particular
and
thankful
respects
to
the
Countess
,
for
her
favour
and
goodness
to
me
,
which
I
shall
ever
place
next
,
in
my
grateful
esteem
,
to
the
honours
I
have
received
from
your
ladyship
,
and
which
bind
me
to
be
,
with
the
greatest
respect
,
your
faithful
and
obliged
servant
,
P.B.
    
MY
DEAR
FATHER
AND
MOTHER
,
  
<EOS>
I
write
to
you
both
,
at
this
time
,
for
your
advice
in
a
particular
dispute
,
which
is
the
only
one
I
have
had
,
or
I
hope
ever
shall
have
,
with
my
dear
benefactor
;
and
as
he
is
pleased
to
insist
upon
his
way
,
and
it
is
a
point
of
conscience
with
me
,
I
must
resolve
to
be
determined
by
your
joint
advice
;
for
,
if
my
father
and
mother
,
and
husband
,
are
of
one
opinion
,
I
must
,
I
think
,
yield
up
my
own
.
  
<EOS>
This
is
the
subject
:
 
<EOS>
I
think
a
mother
ought
,
if
she
can
,
to
be
the
nurse
to
her
own
children
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
says
,
he
will
not
permit
it
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
the
first
will
not
I
have
heard
from
him
,
or
given
occasion
for
:
<EOS>
and
I
tell
him
,
that
it
is
a
point
of
conscience
with
me
,
and
I
hope
he
will
indulge
me
:
but
<EOS>
the
dear
gentleman
has
an
odd
way
of
arguing
,
that
sometimes
puzzles
me
.
<EOS>
He
pretends
to
answer
me
from
Scripture
;
but
I
have
some
doubts
of
his
exposition
;
and
he
gives
me
leave
to
write
to
you
,
though
yet
he
wo
n't
promise
to
be
determined
by
your
opinions
if
they
are
not
the
same
with
his
own
;
and
I
say
to
him
,
"
Is
this
fair
,
my
dearest
Mr.
B.
?
<EOS>
Is
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
has
got
the
dean
's
opinion
with
him
;
for
our
debate
began
before
we
came
to
town
:
<EOS>
and
then
he
would
not
let
me
state
the
case
;
but
did
it
himself
;
and
yet
'
tis
but
an
half
opinion
,
as
I
may
,
neither
.
<EOS>
For
it
is
,
that
if
the
husband
is
set
upon
it
,
it
is
a
wife
's
duty
to
obey
.
  
<EOS>
But
I
ca
n't
see
how
that
is
;
for
if
it
be
the
natural
duty
of
a
mother
,
it
is
a
divine
duty
;
and
how
can
a
husband
have
power
to
discharge
a
divine
duty
?
<EOS>
As
great
as
a
wife
's
obligation
is
to
obey
her
husband
,
which
is
,
I
own
,
one
indispensable
of
the
marriage
contract
,
it
ought
not
to
interfere
with
what
one
takes
to
be
a
superior
duty
;
and
must
not
one
be
one
's
own
judge
of
actions
,
by
which
we
must
stand
or
fall
?
  
<EOS>
I
'll
tell
you
my
plea
:
  
<EOS>
I
say
,
that
where
a
mother
is
unhealthy
;
subject
to
communicative
distempers
,
as
scrophulous
or
scorbutic
,
or
consumptive
disorders
,
which
have
infected
the
blood
or
lungs
;
or
where
they
have
not
plenty
of
nourishment
for
the
child
,
that
in
these
cases
,
a
dispensation
lies
of
course
.
  
<EOS>
But
where
there
is
good
health
,
free
spirits
,
and
plentiful
nourishment
,
I
think
it
an
indispensable
duty
.
  
<EOS>
For
this
was
the
custom
of
old
,
of
all
the
good
wives
we
read
of
in
Scripture
.
  
<EOS>
Then
the
nourishment
of
the
mother
must
be
most
natural
to
the
child
.
  
<EOS>
These
were
my
pleas
,
among
others
:
and
this
is
his
answer
which
he
gave
to
me
in
writing
:
  
"
<EOS>
As
to
what
you
allege
,
my
dear
,
of
old
customs
;
times
and
fashions
are
much
changed
.
<EOS>
If
you
tell
me
of
Sarah
's
,
or
Rachel
's
,
or
Rebecca
's
,
or
Leah
's
nursing
their
children
,
I
can
answer
,
that
the
one
drew
water
at
a
well
,
for
her
father
's
flocks
;
another
kneaded
cakes
,
and
baked
them
on
the
hearth
;
another
dressed
savoury
meat
for
her
husband
;
and
all
of
them
performed
the
common
offices
of
the
household
:
and
when
our
modern
ladies
shall
follow
such
examples
in
every
thing
,
their
plea
ought
to
be
allowed
in
this
.
  
<EOS>
"
Besides
,
my
fondness
for
your
personal
graces
,
and
the
laudable
,
and
,
I
will
say
,
honest
pleasure
,
I
take
in
that
easy
,
genteel
form
,
which
every
body
admires
in
you
,
at
first
sight
,
oblige
me
to
declare
,
that
I
can
by
no
means
consent
to
sacrifice
these
to
the
carelessness
into
which
I
have
seen
very
nice
ladies
sink
,
when
they
became
nurses
.
<EOS>
Moreover
,
my
chief
delight
in
you
is
for
the
beauties
of
your
mind
;
and
unequalled
as
they
are
,
in
my
opinion
,
you
have
still
a
genius
capable
of
great
improvement
;
and
I
sha
n't
care
,
when
I
want
to
hear
my
Pamela
read
her
French
and
Latin
lessons
,
which
I
take
so
much
delight
to
teach
her
(
and
to
endeavour
to
improve
myself
from
her
virtue
and
piety
,
at
the
same
time
)
,
to
seek
my
beloved
in
the
nursery
;
or
to
permit
her
to
be
engrossed
by
those
baby
offices
,
which
will
better
befit
weaker
minds
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
my
dear
,
you
must
allow
me
to
look
upon
you
as
my
scholar
,
in
one
sense
;
as
my
companion
in
another
;
and
as
my
instructress
,
in
a
third
.
<EOS>
You
know
I
am
not
governed
by
the
worst
motives
<EOS>
:
I
am
half
overcome
by
your
virtue
:
and
you
must
take
care
,
that
you
leave
not
your
work
half
done
.
<EOS>
But
I
can
not
help
looking
upon
the
nurse
's
office
,
as
an
office
beneath
Pamela
.
<EOS>
Let
it
have
your
inspection
,
your
direction
,
and
your
sole
attention
,
if
you
please
,
when
I
am
abroad
:
but
when
I
am
at
home
,
even
a
son
and
heir
,
so
jealous
am
I
of
your
affections
,
shall
not
be
my
rival
in
them
:
nor
will
I
have
my
rest
broken
in
upon
,
by
your
servants
bringing
to
you
your
dear
little
one
,
at
times
,
perhaps
,
as
unsuitable
to
my
repose
and
your
own
,
as
to
the
child
's
necessities
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
chief
thing
with
you
,
my
dear
,
is
that
you
think
it
unnatural
in
a
mother
not
to
be
a
nurse
to
her
own
child
,
if
she
can
;
and
what
is
unnatural
,
you
say
,
is
sin
.
  
<EOS>
"
Some
men
may
be
fond
of
having
their
wives
undertake
this
province
,
and
good
reasons
may
be
assigned
for
such
their
fondness
;
but
it
suits
not
me
at
all
.
<EOS>
And
yet
no
man
would
be
thought
to
have
a
greater
affection
for
children
than
myself
,
or
be
more
desirous
to
do
them
justice
;
for
I
think
every
one
should
look
forward
to
posterity
with
a
preference
:
but
if
my
Pamela
can
be
better
employed
;
if
the
office
can
be
equally
well
performed
;
if
your
direction
and
superintendence
will
be
sufficient
;
and
if
I
can
not
look
upon
you
in
that
way
with
equal
delight
,
as
if
it
was
otherwise
;
I
insist
upon
it
,
my
Pamela
,
that
you
acquiesce
with
my
dispensation
,
and
do
n't
think
to
let
me
lose
my
beloved
wife
,
and
have
a
nurse
put
upon
me
instead
of
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
to
that
(
the
nearest
to
me
of
all
)
of
dangers
to
your
constitution
:
there
is
as
much
reason
to
hope
it
may
not
be
so
,
as
to
fear
that
it
may
.
<EOS>
For
children
sometimes
bring
health
with
them
as
well
as
infirmity
;
and
it
is
not
a
little
likely
,
that
the
nurse
's
office
may
affect
the
health
of
one
I
hold
most
dear
,
who
has
no
very
robust
constitution
,
and
thinks
it
so
much
her
duty
to
attend
to
it
,
that
she
will
abridge
herself
of
half
the
pleasures
of
life
,
and
on
that
account
confine
herself
within
doors
,
or
,
in
the
other
case
,
must
take
with
her
her
infant
and
her
nursery
-
maid
wherever
she
goes
;
and
I
shall
either
have
very
fine
company
(
shall
I
not
?
)
or
be
obliged
to
deny
myself
yours
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
,
as
I
propose
to
give
you
a
smattering
of
the
French
and
Italian
,
I
know
not
<EOS>
but
I
may
take
you
on
a
little
tour
into
France
and
Italy
;
at
least
,
to
Bath
,
Tunbridge
,
Oxford
,
York
,
and
the
principal
places
of
England
.
<EOS>
Wherefore
,
as
I
love
to
look
upon
you
as
the
companion
of
my
pleasures
,
I
advise
you
,
my
dearest
love
,
not
to
weaken
,
or
,
to
speak
in
a
phrase
proper
to
the
present
subject
,
wean
me
from
that
love
to
you
,
and
admiration
of
you
,
which
hitherto
has
been
rather
increasing
than
otherwise
,
as
your
merit
,
and
regard
for
me
have
increased
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
These
,
my
dear
parents
,
are
charming
allurements
,
almost
irresistible
temptations
!
<EOS>
And
what
makes
me
mistrust
myself
the
more
,
and
be
the
more
diffident
;
for
we
are
but
too
apt
to
be
persuaded
into
any
thing
,
when
the
motives
are
so
tempting
as
the
last
.
  
<EOS>
I
take
it
for
granted
,
that
many
wives
will
not
choose
to
dispute
this
point
so
earnestly
as
I
have
done
;
for
we
have
had
several
little
debates
about
it
;
and
it
is
the
only
point
I
have
ever
yet
debated
with
him
;
but
one
would
not
be
altogether
implicit
neither
.
<EOS>
It
is
no
compliment
to
him
to
be
quite
passive
,
and
to
have
no
will
at
all
of
one
's
own
:
yet
would
I
not
dispute
one
point
,
but
in
supposition
of
a
superior
obligation
:
and
this
,
he
says
,
he
can
dispense
with
.
<EOS>
But
alas
!
<EOS>
my
dear
Mr.
B.
was
never
yet
thought
so
entirely
fit
to
fill
up
the
character
of
a
casuistical
divine
,
as
that
one
may
absolutely
rely
upon
his
decisions
in
these
serious
points
:
and
you
know
we
must
stand
or
fall
by
our
own
judgments
.
  
<EOS>
Upon
condition
,
therefore
,
that
he
requires
not
to
see
this
my
letter
,
nor
your
answer
to
it
,
I
write
for
your
advice
.
<EOS>
But
this
I
see
plainly
,
that
he
will
have
his
own
way
;
and
if
I
can
not
get
over
my
scruples
,
what
shall
I
do
?
<EOS>
For
if
I
think
it
a
sin
to
submit
to
the
dispensation
he
insists
upon
as
in
his
power
to
grant
,
and
to
submit
to
it
,
what
will
become
of
my
peace
of
mind
?
<EOS>
For
it
is
not
in
our
power
to
believe
as
one
will
.
  
<EOS>
As
to
the
liberty
he
gives
me
for
a
month
,
I
should
be
loath
to
take
it
;
for
one
knows
not
the
inconveniences
that
may
attend
a
change
of
nourishment
;
or
if
I
did
,
I
should
rather
 
<EOS>
But
I
know
not
what
I
would
say
;
for
I
am
but
a
young
creature
to
be
in
this
way
,
and
so
very
unequal
to
it
in
every
respect
!
<EOS>
So
I
commit
myself
to
God
's
direction
,
and
your
advice
,
as
becomes
your
ever
dutiful
daughter
,
P.B.
    
<EOS>
My
Dearest
Child
,
  
Your
mother
and
I
have
as
well
considered
the
case
you
put
as
we
are
able
;
and
we
think
your
own
reasons
very
good
;
and
it
is
a
thousand
pities
your
honoured
husband
will
not
allow
them
,
as
you
,
my
dear
,
make
it
such
a
point
with
you
.
<EOS>
Very
few
ladies
would
give
their
spouses
,
we
believe
,
the
trouble
of
this
debate
;
and
few
gentlemen
are
so
very
nice
as
yours
in
this
respect
;
for
I
(
but
what
signifies
what
such
a
mean
soul
as
I
think
,
compared
to
so
learned
and
brave
a
gentleman
;
yet
<EOS>
I
)
always
thought
your
dear
mother
,
and
she
has
been
a
pretty
woman
too
,
in
her
time
,
never
looked
so
lovely
,
as
when
I
saw
her
,
like
the
pelican
in
the
wilderness
,
feeding
her
young
ones
from
her
kind
breast
:
 
and
had
I
never
so
noble
an
estate
,
I
should
have
had
the
same
thoughts
.
  
<EOS>
But
since
the
good
"
squire
can
not
take
this
pleasure
;
since
he
so
much
values
your
person
;
since
he
gives
you
warning
,
that
it
may
estrange
his
affections
;
since
he
is
impatient
of
denial
,
and
thinks
so
highly
of
his
prerogative
;
since
he
may
,
if
disobliged
,
resume
some
bad
habits
,
and
so
you
may
have
all
your
prayers
and
hopes
in
his
perfect
reformation
frustrated
,
and
find
your
own
power
to
do
good
more
narrowed
:
we
think
,
besides
the
obedience
you
have
vowed
to
him
,
and
is
the
duty
of
every
good
wife
,
you
ought
to
give
up
the
point
,
and
acquiesce
;
for
this
seemeth
to
us
to
be
the
lesser
evil
:
<EOS>
and
God
Almighty
,
if
it
should
be
your
duty
,
will
not
be
less
merciful
than
men
;
who
,
as
his
honour
says
,
by
the
laws
of
the
realm
,
excuses
a
wife
,
when
she
is
faulty
by
the
command
of
the
husband
;
and
we
hope
,
the
fault
he
is
pleased
to
make
you
commit
(
if
a
fault
,
for
he
really
gives
very
praise
-
worthy
motives
for
his
dispensation
)
will
not
be
laid
at
his
own
door
.
<EOS>
So
e'en
resolve
,
my
dearest
child
,
to
submit
to
it
,
and
with
cheerfulness
too
.
  
<EOS>
God
send
you
an
happy
hour
!
<EOS>
But
who
knows
,
when
the
time
comes
,
whether
it
may
not
be
proper
to
dispense
with
this
duty
,
as
you
deem
it
,
on
other
accounts
?
<EOS>
For
every
young
person
is
not
enabled
to
perform
it
.
<EOS>
So
,
to
shew
his
honour
,
that
you
will
cheerfully
acquiesce
,
your
dear
mother
advises
you
to
look
out
for
a
wholesome
,
good
-
humoured
,
honest
body
,
as
near
your
complexion
and
temper
,
and
constitution
,
as
may
be
;
and
it
may
not
be
the
worse
,
she
thinks
,
if
she
is
twenty
,
or
one
 
or
two
-
and
-
twenty
;
for
she
will
have
more
strength
and
perfection
,
as
one
may
say
,
than
even
you
can
have
at
your
tender
age
:
and
,
above
all
,
for
the
wise
reason
you
give
from
your
reading
,
that
she
may
be
brought
to
-
bed
much
about
your
time
,
if
possible
.
<EOS>
We
can
look
out
,
about
us
,
for
such
an
one
.
<EOS>
And
,
as
Mr.
B.
is
not
adverse
to
have
the
dear
child
in
the
house
,
you
will
have
as
much
delight
,
and
the
dear
baby
may
fare
as
well
,
under
your
prudent
and
careful
eye
,
as
if
you
were
obliged
in
the
way
you
would
choose
.
  
<EOS>
So
God
direct
you
,
my
child
,
in
all
your
ways
,
and
make
you
acquiesce
in
this
point
with
cheerfulness
(
although
,
as
you
say
,
one
can
not
believe
,
as
one
pleases
;
for
we
verily
are
of
opinion
you
safely
may
,
as
matters
stand
)
and
continue
to
you
,
and
your
honoured
husband
,
health
,
and
all
manner
of
happiness
,
are
the
prayers
of
your
most
affectionate
father
and
mother

<EOS>
I
thank
you
,
my
dearest
parents
,
for
your
kind
letter
;
it
was
given
to
Mr.
B.
and
he
brought
it
to
me
himself
,
and
was
angry
with
me
:
indeed
he
was
,
as
you
shall
hear
:
  
"

<EOS>
Tis
from
the
good
couple

my
dear

I
see

<EOS>
I
hope
they
are
of
my
opinion
 
<EOS>
But
whether
they
be
or
not
 
<EOS>
But
I
will
leave
you
;
and
do
you
,
Pamela
,
step
down
to
my
closet
,
when
you
have
perused
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
was
pleased
to
withdraw
;
and
I
read
it
,
and
sat
down
,
and
considered
it
well
;
but
,
as
you
know
I
made
it
always
my
maxim
to
do
what
I
could
not
avoid
to
do
,
with
as
good
a
grace
as
possible
,
I
waited
on
the
dear
gentleman
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Pamela
,
"
said
he
,
a
little
seriously
,
"
what
say
the
worthy
pair
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
O
Sir
!
<EOS>
they
declare
for
you
.
<EOS>
They
say
,
it
is
best
for
me
to
yield
up
this
point
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
are
certainly
in
the
right
 
<EOS>
But
were
you
not
a
dear
perverse
creature
,
to
give
me
all
this
trouble
about
your
saucy
scruples
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nay
,
Sir
,
do
n't
call
them
so
,
"
said
I
,
little
thinking
he
was
displeased
with
me
.
<EOS>
"
I
still
am
somewhat
wavering
;
though
they
advise
me
to
acquiesce
;
and
,
as
it
is
your
will
,
and
you
have
determined
,
it
is
my
duty
to
yield
up
the
point
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
do
you
yield
it
up
cheerfully
,
my
dear
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
,
Sir
;
and
will
never
more
dispute
it
,
let
what
will
happen
.
<EOS>
And
I
beg
pardon
for
having
so
often
entered
into
this
subject
with
you
.
<EOS>
But
you
know
,
Sir
,
if
one
's
weakness
of
mind
gives
one
scruples
,
one
should
not
yield
implicitly
,
till
they
are
satisfied
;
for
that
would
look
as
if
one
gave
not
you
the
obedience
of
a
free
mind
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
very
obliging
,
just
now
,
my
dear
;
but
I
can
tell
you
,
you
had
made
me
half
serious
;
yet
I
would
not
shew
it
,
in
compliment
to
your
present
condition
;
for
I
did
not
expect
that
you
would
have
thought
any
appeal
necessary
,
though
to
your
parents
,
in
a
point
that
I
was
determined
upon
,
as
you
must
see
,
every
time
we
talked
of
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
This
struck
me
all
in
a
heap
.
<EOS>
I
looked
down
to
the
ground
:
having
no
courage
to
look
up
to
his
face
,
for
fear
I
should
behold
his
aspect
as
mortifying
to
me
as
his
words
.
<EOS>
But
he
took
both
my
hands
,
and
drew
me
kindly
to
him
,
and
saluted
me
,
"
<EOS>
Excuse
me
,
<EOS>
my
dearest
love
:
I
am
not
angry
with
you
.
<EOS>
Why
starts
this
precious
pearl
?
"
and
kissed
my
cheek
:
<EOS>
"
speak
to
me
,
Pamela
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
,
<EOS>
Sir
 
I
<EOS>
will
 
as
soon
as
I
can
:
"
for
this
being
my
first
check
,
so
seriously
given
,
my
heart
was
full
.
<EOS>
But
as
I
knew
he
would
be
angry
,
and
think
me
obstinate
<EOS>
,
if
I
did
not
speak
,
I
said
,
full
of
concern
,
"
I
wish
,
Sir
 
I
wish
 
you
had
been
pleased
to
spare
me
a
little
longer
,
for
the
same
kind
,
very
kind
,
consideration
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
is
it
not
better
,
my
dear
,
to
tell
you
I
was
a
little
out
of
humour
with
you
,
than
that
I
am
?
 
<EOS>
But
you
were
very
earnest
with
me
on
this
point
more
than
once
;
and
you
put
me
upon
a
hated
,
because
ungenerous
,
necessity
of
pleading
my
prerogative
,
as
I
call
it
;
yet
this
would
not
do
,
but
you
appealed
against
me
in
the
point
I
was
determined
upon
,
for
reasons
altogether
in
your
favour
:
and
if
this
was
not
like
my
Pamela
,
excuse
me
,
that
I
could
not
help
being
a
little
unlike
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
"
thought
I
,
"
this
is
not
so
very
unlike
your
dear
self
,
were
I
to
give
the
least
shadow
of
an
occasion
;
for
it
is
of
a
piece
with
your
lessons
formerly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
,
"
said
I
,
"
I
was
not
in
the
least
aware
,
that
I
had
offended
.
<EOS>
But
I
was
too
little
circumspect
.
<EOS>
I
had
been
used
to
your
goodness
for
so
long
a
time
,
that
I
expected
it
,
it
seems
;
and
thought
I
was
sure
of
your
favourable
construction
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
so
you
may
be
,
my
dear
,
in
every
thing
almost
.
<EOS>
But
I
do
n't
love
to
speak
twice
my
mind
on
the
same
subject
;
you
know
I
do
n't
!
<EOS>
and
you
have
really
disputed
this
point
with
me
five
or
six
times
;
insomuch
,
that
I
wondered
what
was
come
to
my
dearest
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
thought
,
Sir
,
you
would
have
distinguished
between
a
command
where
my
conscience
was
concerned
,
and
a
common
point
:
you
know
.
<EOS>
Sir
,
I
never
had
any
will
but
yours
in
common
points
.
<EOS>
But
,
indeed
,
you
make
me
fearful
because
my
task
is
rendered
too
difficult
for
my
own
weak
judgment
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
was
silent
,
but
by
my
tears
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
I
doubt
,
Pamela
,
your
spirit
is
high
.
<EOS>
You
wo
n't
speak
,
because
you
are
out
of
humour
at
what
I
say
.
<EOS>
I
will
have
no
sullen
reserves
,
my
dearest
.
<EOS>
What
means
that
heaving
sob
?
<EOS>
I
know
that
this
is
the
time
with
your
sex
,
when
,
saddened
with
your
apprehensions
,
and
indulged
because
of
them
,
by
the
fond
husband
,
it
is
needful
,
for
both
their
sakes
,
to
watch
over
the
changes
of
their
temper
.
<EOS>
For
ladies
in
your
way
are
often
like
encroaching
subjects
;
apt
to
extend
what
they
call
their
privileges
,
on
the
indulgence
shewed
them
;
and
the
husband
never
again
recovers
the
ascendant
he
had
before
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
these
things
better
than
I
,
Mr.
B.
<EOS>
But
I
had
no
intention
to
invade
your
province
,
or
to
go
out
of
my
own
.
<EOS>
Yet
I
thought
I
had
a
right
to
a
little
free
will
,
on
some
greater
occasions
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
so
you
have
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
But
you
must
not
plead
in
behalf
of
your
own
will
,
and
refuse
to
give
due
weight
to
mine
.
"
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Sir
,
I
must
needs
say
,
I
have
one
advantage
above
others
of
my
sex
;
for
if
wives
,
in
my
circumstances
,
are
apt
to
grow
upon
indulgence
,
I
am
very
happy
that
your
kind
and
watchful
care
will
hinder
me
from
falling
into
that
error
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
gave
me
a
gentle
tap
on
the
neck
:
"
Let
me
beat
my
beloved
sauce
-
box
,
"
said
he
:
"
is
it
thus
you
rally
my
watchful
care
over
you
for
your
own
good
?
<EOS>
But
tell
me
,
truly
,
Pamela
,
are
you
not
a
little
sullen
?
<EOS>
Look
up
to
me
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
Are
you
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
I
am
;
but
'
tis
but
very
little
,
Sir
.
<EOS>
It
will
soon
go
off
.
<EOS>
Please
to
let
me
withdraw
,
that
I
may
take
myself
to
task
about
it;-for
at
present
,
I
know
not
what
to
do
,
because
I
did
not
expect
the
displeasure
I
have
incurred
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
it
not
the
same
thing
,
"
replied
he
,
"
if
this
our
first
quarrel
end
here
,
without
your
withdrawing
?
 
<EOS>
I
forgive
you
heartily
,
my
Pamela
;
and
give
me
one
kiss
,
and
I
will
think
of
your
saucy
appeal
against
me
no
more
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
comply
with
your
condition
,
Sir
;
but
I
have
a
great
mind
to
be
saucy
.
<EOS>
I
wish
you
would
let
me
for
this
once
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
would
you
say
,
my
dearest
?
 
<EOS>
Be
saucy
then
,
as
you
call
it
,
as
saucy
as
you
can
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
;
then
I
am
a
little
sullen
at
present
,
that
I
am
;
and
I
am
not
fully
convinced
,
whether
it
must
be
I
that
forgive
you
,
or
you
me
.
<EOS>
For
,
indeed
,
if
I
can
recollect
,
I
can
not
think
my
fault
so
great
in
this
point
,
that
was
a
point
of
conscience
to
me
,
as
(
pardon
me
Sir
)
,
to
stand
in
need
of
your
forgiveness
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
then
,
my
dearest
,
"
said
he
,
"
we
will
forgive
one
another
?
<EOS>
but
take
this
with
you
,
that
it
is
my
love
to
you
that
makes
me
more
delicate
than
otherwise
I
should
be
;
and
you
have
inured
me
so
much
to
a
faultless
conduct
,
that
I
can
hardly
bear
with
natural
infirmities
from
you
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
"
giving
me
another
tap
,
"
get
you
gone
;
I
leave
you
to
your
recollection
;
and
let
me
know
what
fruits
it
produces
:
for
I
must
not
be
put
off
with
a
half
-
compliance
;
I
must
have
your
whole
will
with
me
,
if
possible
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
So
I
went
up
,
and
recollecting
every
thing
,
sacrificed
to
my
sex
,
as
Mr.
B.
calls
it
,
when
he
talks
of
a
wife
's
reluctance
to
yield
a
favourite
point
:
for
I
shed
many
tears
,
because
my
heart
was
set
upon
it
.
  
<EOS>
And
so
,
my
dear
parents
,
twenty
charming
ideas
and
pleasures
I
had
formed
to
myself
,
are
vanished
from
me
,
and
my
measures
are
quite
broken
.
<EOS>
But
after
my
heart
was
relieved
by
my
eye
,
I
was
lighter
and
easier
.
<EOS>
And
the
result
is
,
we
have
heard
of
a
good
sort
of
woman
,
that
is
to
be
my
poor
baby
's
mother
,
when
it
comes
;
so
your
kindly
-
offered
enquiries
are
needless
,
I
believe
.
  
<EOS>
@@@Tis
<EOS>
well
for
our
sex
in
general
,
that
there
are
not
many
husbands
who
distinguish
thus
nicely
.
<EOS>
For
,
I
doubt
,
there
are
but
very
few
so
well
entitled
to
their
ladies
"
observances
as
Mr.
B.
is
to
mine
,
and
who
would
act
so
generously
and
<EOS>
so
tenderly
by
a
wife
as
he
does
,
in
every
material
instance
on
which
the
happiness
of
life
depends
.
  
<EOS>
But
we
are
quite
reconciled
;
although
as
I
said
,
upon
his
own
terms
:
and
so
I
can
still
style
myself
,
my
dear
honoured
parents
,
your
happy
,
as
well
as
your
dutiful
daughter
,
P.B.
    
From
Lady
Davers
to
Mrs.
<EOS>
B.
  
My
Dear
Pamela
,
  
I
have
sent
you
a
present
,
the
completest
I
could
procure
,
of
every
thing
that
may
suit
your
approaching
happy
circumstance
;
<EOS>
as
I
hope
it
will
be
to
you
,
and
to
us
all
:
but
it
is
with
a
hope
annexed
,
that
although
both
sexes
are
thought
of
in
it
,
you
will
not
put
us
off
with
a
girl
:
<EOS>
no
,
child
,
we
will
not
permit
you
,
<EOS>
may
we
have
our
wills
,
to
think
of
giving
us
a
girl
,
till
you
have
presented
us
with
half
a
dozen
fine
boys
.
<EOS>
For
our
line
is
gone
so
low
<EOS>
,
we
expect
that
human
security
from
you
in
your
first
seven
years
,
or
we
shall
be
disappointed
.
  
<EOS>
I
will
now
give
you
their
names
,
if
my
brother
and
you
approve
of
them
:
your
first
shall
be
BILLY
;
my
Lord
Davers
,
and
the
Earl
of
C
#
#
#
#
,
godfathers
;
and
it
must
be
doubly
godmothered
too
,
or
I
am
afraid
<EOS>
the
countess
and
<EOS>
I
shall
fall
out
about
it
.
<EOS>
Your
second
DAVERS
;
be
sure
remember
that
.
 
<EOS>
Your
third
,
CHARLEY
;
your
fourth
,
JEMMY
;
your
fifth
,
HARRY
;
your
sixth
 
DUDLEY
,
if
you
will
 
and
your
girl
,
if
you
had
not
rather
call
it
PAMELA
,
shall
be
called
BARBARA
.
 
<EOS>
The
rest
name
as
you
please
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
,
my
dear
,
I
wish
all
seven
happily
over
with
you
.
  
<EOS>
I
am
glad
you
got
safe
to
town
:
and
long
to
hear
of
Miss
Darnford
's
arrival
,
because
I
know
you
'll
be
out
of
your
bias
in
your
new
settlement
till
then
.
<EOS>
She
is
a
fine
lady
,
and
writes
the
most
to
my
taste
of
any
one
of
her
sex
that
I
know
,
next
to
you
.
<EOS>
I
wish
she
'd
be
so
kind
as
to
correspond
with
me
.
<EOS>
But
be
sure
do
n't
omit
to
give
me
the
sequel
of
her
sister
's
and
Murray
's
affair
,
and
what
you
think
will
please
me
in
relation
to
her.-You
do
well
to
save
yourself
the
trouble
of
describing
the
town
and
the
public
places
.
<EOS>
We
are
no
strangers
to
them
;
and
they
are
too
much
our
table
talk
,
when
any
country
lady
has
for
the
first
time
been
carried
to
town
,
and
returned
:
besides
,
what
London
affords
,
is
nothing
that
deserves
mention
,
compared
to
what
we
have
seen
at
Paris
and
at
Versailles
,
and
other
of
the
French
palaces
.
<EOS>
You
exactly
,
therefore
,
hit
our
tastes
,
and
answer
our
expectations
,
when
you
give
us
,
in
your
peculiar
manner
,
sentiments
on
what
we
may
call
the
soul
of
things
,
and
such
characters
as
you
draw
with
a
pencil
borrowed
from
the
hand
of
nature
,
intermingled
with
those
fine
lights
and
shades
of
reflections
and
observations
,
that
make
your
pictures
glow
,
and
instruct
as
well
as
delight
.
  
<EOS>
There
,
Pamela
,
is
encouragement
for
you
to
proceed
in
obliging
us
.
<EOS>
We
are
all
of
one
mind
in
this
respect
;
and
more
than
ever
,
since
we
have
seen
your
actions
so
well
answered
to
your
writings
;
and
that
theory
and
practice
,
as
to
every
excellence
that
can
adorn
a
lady
,
is
the
same
thing
with
you
.
  
<EOS>
We
are
pleased
with
your
lawyers
'
characters
.
<EOS>
There
are
life
and
nature
in
them
;
but
never
avoid
giving
all
that
occur
to
you
,
for
that
seems
to
be
one
of
your
talents
;
and
in
the
ugliest
,
there
will
be
matter
of
instruction
;
especially
as
you
seem
naturally
to
fall
upon
such
as
are
so
general
,
that
no
one
who
converses
,
but
must
see
in
them
the
picture
of
one
or
other
he
is
acquainted
with
.
  
<EOS>
By
this
time
,
perhaps
,
Miss
Darnford
will
be
with
you
.
 
<EOS>
Our
respects
to
her
,
if
so
.
 
<EOS>
And
you
will
have
been
at
some
of
the
theatrical
entertainments
:
so
will
not
want
subjects
to
oblige
us
.
 
<EOS>
'
Twas
a
good
thought
of
your
dear
man
's
,
to
carry
you
to
see
the
several
houses
,
and
to
make
you
a
judge
,
by
that
means
,
of
the
disposition
and
fashion
of
every
thing
in
them.-Tell
him
<EOS>
,
I
love
him
better
and
better
.
<EOS>
I
am
proud
of
my
brother
,
and
do
nothing
but
talk
of
what
a
charming
husband
he
makes
.
<EOS>
But
then
,
he
gives
an
example
to
all
who
know
him
,
and
his
uncontrollable
temper
(
which
makes
against
many
of
us
)
,
that
it
is
possible
for
a
good
wife
to
make
even
a
bad
man
a
worthy
husband
:
and
this
affords
an
instruction
,
which
may
stand
all
our
sex
in
good
stead
.
 
<EOS>
But
then
they
must
have
been
cautious
first
,
to
choose
a
man
of
natural
good
sense
,
and
good
manners
,
and
not
a
brutal
or
abandoned
debauchee
.
  
<EOS>
But
hark
-
ye
-
me
,
my
sweet
girl
,
what
have
I
done
,
that
you
wo
n't
write
yourself
sister
to
me
?
<EOS>
I
could
find
in
my
heart
to
be
angry
with
you
.
<EOS>
Before
my
last
visit
,
I
was
scrupulous
to
subscribe
myself
so
to
you
.
<EOS>
But
since
I
have
seen
myself
so
much
surpassed
in
every
excellence
,
that
I
would
take
pleasure
in
the
name
,
you
assume
a
pride
in
your
turn
,
and
may
think
it
under
-
valuing
yourself
,
to
call
me
so
 
<EOS>
Ay
,
that
's
the
thing
<EOS>
,
I
doubt
 
Although
I
have
endeavoured
by
several
regulations
since
my
return
(
and
the
countess
,
too
,
keeps
your
example
in
distant
view
,
as
well
as
I
)
,
to
be
more
worthy
of
the
appellation
.
<EOS>
If
,
therefore
,
you
would
avoid
the
reproaches
of
secret
pride
,
under
the
shadow
of
so
remarkable
an
humility
,
for
the
future
never
omit
subscribing
as
I
do
,
with
great
pleasure
,
your
truly
affectionate
sister
and
friend
,
B.
DAVERS
.
  
<EOS>
I
always
take
it
for
granted
,
that
my
worthy
brother
sends
his
respects
to
us
;
as
you
must
,
that
Lord
Davers
,
the
Countess
of
C.
and
Jackey
(
who
,
as
well
as
his
uncle
,
talks
of
nothing
else
but
you
)
,
send
theirs
;
and
so
unnecessary
compliments
will
be
always
excluded
our
correspondence
.
    
<EOS>
In
answer
to
the
preceding
.
  
<EOS>
How
you
overwhelm
me
with
your
goodness
,
my
dearest
lady
,
in
every
word
of
your
last
welcome
letter
,
is
beyond
my
power
to
express
I
<EOS>
How
nobly
has
your
ladyship
contrived
,
in
your
ever
-
valued
present
,
to
encourage
a
doubting
and
apprehensive
mind
!
<EOS>
And
how
does
it
contribute
to
my
joy
and
my
glory
,
that
I
am
deemed
by
the
noble
sister
of
my
best
beloved
,
not
wholly
unworthy
of
being
the
humble
means
to
continue
,
and
,
perhaps
,
to
perpetuate
,
a
family
so
ancient
and
so
honourable
!
  
<EOS>
When
I
contemplate
this
,
and
look
upon
what
I
was
 
How
shall
I
express
a
sense
of
the
honour
done
me
!
 
<EOS>
And
when
,
reading
over
the
other
engaging
particulars
in
your
ladyship
's
letter
,
I
come
to
the
last
charming
paragraph
,
I
am
doubly
affected
to
see
myself
seemingly
upbraided
,
but
so
politely
emboldened
to
assume
an
appellation
,
that
otherwise
I
hardly
dared
.
  
<EOS>
I
 
humble
<EOS>
I
 
who
never
had
a
sister
before
 
to
find
one
now
in
Lady
Davers
!
<EOS>
O
Madam
,
you
,
and
only
you
,
can
teach
me
words
fit
to
express
the
joy
and
the
gratitude
that
filled
my
delighted
heart
!
 
<EOS>
But
thus
much
I
am
taught
,
that
there
is
some
thing
more
than
the
low
-
born
can
imagine
in
birth
and
education
.
<EOS>
This
is
so
evident
in
your
ladyship
's
actions
,
words
,
and
manner
,
that
it
strikes
one
with
a
becoming
reverence
;
and
we
look
up
with
awe
to
a
condition
we
emulate
in
vain
,
when
raised
by
partial
favour
,
like
what
I
have
found
;
and
are
confounded
when
we
see
grandeur
of
soul
joined
with
grandeur
of
birth
and
condition
;
and
a
noble
lady
acting
thus
nobly
,
as
Lady
Davers
acts
.
  
<EOS>
My
best
wishes
,
and
a
thousand
blessings
,
attend
your
ladyship
in
all
you
undertake
!
<EOS>
And
I
am
persuaded
the
latter
will
,
and
a
peace
and
satisfaction
of
mind
incomparably
to
be
preferred
to
whatever
else
this
world
can
afford
,
in
the
new
regulations
,
<EOS>
which
you
,
and
my
dear
lady
countess
,
have
set
on
foot
in
your
families
:
and
when
I
can
have
the
happiness
to
know
what
they
are
,
I
shall
,
I
am
confident
,
greatly
improve
my
own
methods
by
them
.
  
<EOS>
Were
we
to
live
for
ever
in
this
life
,
we
might
be
careless
and
indifferent
about
these
matters
:
but
when
such
an
uncertainty
as
to
the
time
,
and
such
a
certainty
as
to
the
event
is
before
us
,
a
prudent
mind
will
be
always
preparing
,
till
prepared
;
and
what
can
be
a
better
preparative
,
than
charitable
actions
to
our
fellow
-
creatures
in
the
eye
of
that
Majesty
,
which
wants
nothing
of
us
himself
,
but
to
do
just
the
merciful
things
to
one
another
.
  
<EOS>
Pardon
me
,
my
dearest
lady
,
for
this
my
free
style
.
<EOS>
Methinks
I
am
out
of
myself
!
<EOS>
I
know
not
how
to
descend
all
at
once
from
the
height
to
which
you
have
raised
me
:
and
you
must
forgive
the
reflections
to
which
you
yourself
and
your
own
noble
actions
have
given
birth
.
  
<EOS>
Here
,
having
taken
respite
a
little
,
I
naturally
sink
into
body
again
.
 
<EOS>
And
will
not
your
ladyship
confine
your
expectations
from
me
within
narrower
limits
?
 
<EOS>
For
,
O
,
I
can
not
even
with
my
wishes
,
so
swiftly
follow
your
expectations
,
if
such
they
are
!
<EOS>
But
,
however
,
leaving
futurity
to
HIM
,
who
only
governs
futurity
,
and
who
conducts
us
all
,
and
our
affairs
,
as
shall
best
answer
his
own
divine
purposes
,
I
will
proceed
as
well
as
I
can
,
to
obey
you
in
those
articles
,
which
are
,
at
present
,
more
within
my
own
power
.
  
<EOS>
My
dear
Miss
Darnford
,
then
,
let
me
acquaint
your
ladyship
,
arrived
on
Thursday
last
:
she
had
given
us
notice
,
by
a
line
,
of
the
day
she
set
out
;
and
Sir
Simon
and
Lady
Darnford
saw
her
ten
miles
on
the
way
to
the
stage
coach
in
Sir
Simon
's
coach
,
Mr.
Murray
attending
her
on
horseback
.
<EOS>
They
parted
with
her
,
as
was
easy
to
guess
from
her
merit
,
with
great
tenderness
;
and
we
are
to
look
upon
the
visit
(
as
we
do
)
as
a
high
favour
from
her
papa
and
mamma
;
who
,
however
,
charge
her
not
to
exceed
a
month
in
and
out
,
which
I
regret
much
.
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
kindly
proposed
to
me
,
as
she
came
in
the
stage
coach
,
attended
with
one
maid
-
servant
,
to
meet
her
part
of
the
way
in
his
coach
and
six
,
if
,
as
he
was
pleased
to
say
,
it
would
not
be
too
fatiguing
to
me
;
and
we
would
go
so
early
,
as
to
dine
at
St.
Alban
's
.
<EOS>
I
gladly
consented
,
and
we
got
thither
about
one
o'clock
;
and
while
dinner
was
preparing
,
he
was
pleased
to
shew
me
the
great
church
there
,
and
the
curious
vault
of
the
good
Duke
of
Gloucester
,
and
also
the
monument
of
the
great
Lord
Chancellor
Bacon
in
St.
Michael
's
church
;
<EOS>
all
which
,
no
doubt
,
your
ladyship
has
seen
.
  
<EOS>
There
happened
to
be
six
passengers
in
the
stage
coach
,
including
Miss
Darnford
and
her
maid
;
she
was
exceeding
glad
to
be
relieved
from
them
,
though
the
weather
was
cold
enough
,
two
of
the
passengers
being
not
very
agreeable
company
,
one
a
rough
military
man
,
and
the
other
a
positive
humoursome
old
gentlewoman
:
and
the
others
two
sisters
 
"
who
jangled
now
<EOS>
and
then
,
"
said
she
,
"
as
much
as
my
sister
,
and
my
sister
's
sister
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Judge
how
joyful
this
meeting
was
to
us
both
.
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
was
no
less
delighted
,
and
said
,
he
was
infinitely
obliged
to
Sir
Simon
for
this
precious
trust
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
come
with
double
pleasure
,
"
said
she
,
"
to
see
the
greatest
curiosity
in
England
,
a
husband
and
wife
,
who
have
not
,
in
so
many
months
as
you
have
been
married
,
if
I
may
believe
report
,
and
your
letters
,
Mrs.
B.
,
once
repented
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
severe
,
Miss
Darnford
,
"
replied
Mr.
B.
,
"
upon
people
in
the
married
state
:
I
hope
there
are
many
such
instances
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
might
,
if
there
were
more
such
husbands
as
Mr.
B.
makes
.
 
<EOS>
I
hated
you
once
,
and
thought
you
very
wicked
;
but
I
revere
you
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
will
revere
any
body
,
my
dear
Miss
Darnford
,
"
said
he
,
"
let
it
be
this
good
girl
;
for
it
is
all
owing
to
her
conduct
and
direction
,
that
I
make
a
tolerable
husband
:
were
there
more
such
wives
,
I
am
persuaded
,
there
would
be
more
such
husbands
than
there
are
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
my
dear
,
"
said
I
,
"
what
it
is
to
be
wedded
to
a
generous
man
.
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
,
by
his
noble
treatment
of
me
,
creates
a
merit
in
me
,
and
disclaims
the
natural
effects
of
his
own
goodness
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
you
're
a
charming
couple
 
person
and
mind
.
<EOS>
I
know
not
any
equal
either
of
you
have
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
Mr.
B.
,
I
will
not
compliment
you
too
highly
.
<EOS>
I
may
make
you
proud
,
for
men
are
saucy
creatures
;
but
I
can
not
make
your
lady
so
:
and
in
this
doubt
of
the
one
,
and
confidence
in
the
other
,
I
must
join
with
you
,
that
her
merit
is
the
greatest
.
 
<EOS>
Since
,
excuse
me
,
Sir
,
her
example
has
reformed
her
rake
;
and
you
have
only
confirmed
in
her
the
virtues
you
found
ready
formed
to
your
hand
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
That
distinction
,
"
said
Mr.
B.
,
"
is
worthy
of
Miss
Darnford
's
judgment
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dearest
Miss
Darnford
 
<EOS>
my
dearest
Mr.
B.
,
"
said
I
,
laying
my
hand
upon
the
hand
of
each
,
"
how
can
you
go
on
thus
!
 
<EOS>
As
I
look
upon
every
kind
thing
,
two
such
dear
friends
say
of
me
,
as
incentives
for
me
to
endeavour
to
deserve
it
,
you
must
not
ask
me
too
high
;
for
then
,
instead
of
encouraging
,
you
'll
make
me
despair
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
led
us
into
the
coach
;
and
in
a
free
,
easy
,
joyful
manner
,
not
in
the
least
tired
or
fatigued
,
did
we
reach
the
town
and
Mr.
B.
's
house
;
with
which
and
its
furniture
,
and
the
apartments
allotted
for
her
,
my
dear
friend
is
highly
pleased
.
  
<EOS>
But
the
dear
lady
put
me
into
some
little
confusion
,
when
she
saw
me
first
,
taking
notice
of
my
improvements
,
as
she
called
them
,
before
Mr.
B.
I
looked
at
him
and
her
with
a
downcast
eye
.
<EOS>
He
smiled
,
and
said
,
"
Would
you
,
my
good
Miss
Darnford
,
look
so
silly
,
after
such
a
length
of
time
,
with
a
husband
you
need
not
be
ashamed
of
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
indeed
,
Sir
,
not
I
,
I
'll
assure
you
;
nor
will
I
forgive
those
maiden
airs
in
a
wife
so
happy
as
you
are
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
said
nothing
.
<EOS>
But
I
wished
myself
,
in
mind
and
behaviour
,
to
be
just
what
Miss
Darnford
is
.
  
<EOS>
But
,
my
dear
lady
,
Miss
Darnford
has
had
those
early
advantages
from
conversation
,
which
I
had
not
;
and
so
must
never
expect
to
know
how
to
deport
myself
with
that
modest
freedom
and
ease
,
which
I
know
I
want
,
and
shall
always
want
,
although
some
of
my
partial
favourers
think
I
do
not
.
<EOS>
For
I
am
every
day
more
and
more
sensible
of
the
great
difference
there
is
between
being
used
to
the
politest
conversation
as
an
inferior
,
and
being
born
to
bear
a
part
in
it
:
in
the
one
,
all
is
set
,
stiff
,
awkward
,
and
the
person
just
such
an
ape
of
imitation
as
poor
I
;
in
the
other
,
all
is
natural
ease
and
sweetness
 
like
Miss
Darnford
.
  
<EOS>
Knowing
this
,
I
do
n't
indeed
aim
at
what
I
am
sensible
I
can
not
attain
;
and
so
,
I
hope
,
am
less
exposed
to
censure
than
I
should
be
if
I
did
.
<EOS>
For
,
I
have
heard
Mr.
B.
observe
with
regard
to
gentlemen
who
build
fine
houses
,
make
fine
gardens
,
and
open
fine
prospects
,
that
art
should
never
take
place
of
,
but
be
subservient
to
,
nature
;
and
a
gentleman
,
if
confined
to
a
situation
,
had
better
conform
his
designs
to
that
,
than
to
do
as
at
Chatsworth
,
level
a
mountain
at
a
monstrous
expense
;
which
,
had
it
been
suffered
to
remain
,
in
so
wild
and
romantic
a
scene
as
Chatsworth
affords
,
might
have
been
made
one
of
the
greatest
beauties
of
the
place
.
  
<EOS>
So
I
think
I
had
better
endeavour
to
make
the
best
of
those
natural
defects
I
can
not
master
,
than
,
by
assuming
airs
and
dignities
in
appearance
,
to
which
I
was
not
born
,
act
neither
part
tolerably
.
<EOS>
By
this
means
,
instead
of
being
thought
neither
gentlewoman
nor
rustic
,
as
Sir
Jacob
hinted
(
linsey
-
wolsey
,
I
think
was
his
term
too
)
,
I
may
be
looked
upon
as
an
original
in
my
way
;
and
all
originals
pass
well
enough
,
you
know
,
Madam
,
even
with
judges
.
  
<EOS>
Now
I
am
upon
this
subject
,
I
can
form
to
myself
,
if
your
ladyship
will
excuse
me
,
two
such
polite
gentlemen
as
my
lawyers
mentioned
in
my
former
,
who
,
with
a
true
London
magnanimity
and
penetration
(
for
,
Madam
<EOS>
,
I
fancy
your
London
critics
will
be
the
severest
upon
the
country
girl
)
,
will
put
on
mighty
significant
looks
,
forgetting
<EOS>
,
it
may
be
,
that
they
have
any
faults
themselves
,
and
apprehending
that
they
have
nothing
to
do
,
but
to
sit
in
judgment
upon
others
,
one
of
them
expressing
himself
after
this
manner
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
truly
,
Jack
,
the
girl
is
well
enough
 
<EOS>
considering
 
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
say
"
(
then
a
pinch
of
snuff
,
<EOS>
perhaps
,
adds
importance
to
his
air
)
 
<EOS>
"
but
a
man
might
love
her
for
a
month
or
two
.
"
<EOS>
(
These
sparks
talked
thus
of
other
ladies
before
me
.
)
<EOS>
"
She
behaves
better
than
I
expected
from
her
 
considering
"
again
will
follow
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
I
think
,
"
cries
the
other
,
and
tosses
his
tie
behind
him
,
with
an
air
partly
of
contempt
,
and
partly
of
rakery
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
you
say
.
<EOS>
Jemmy
,
I
expected
to
find
an
awkward
country
girl
,
but
she
tops
her
part
,
I
'll
assure
you
!
 
<EOS>
Nay
,
for
that
matter
,
behaves
very
tolerably
for
what
she
was
 
<EOS>
And
is
right
,
not
to
seem
desirous
to
drown
the
remembrance
of
her
original
in
her
elevation
 
<EOS>
And
,
I
ca
n't
but
say
"
(
for
something
like
it
he
did
say
)
<EOS>
,
"
is
mighty
pretty
,
and
passably
genteel
.
"
<EOS>
And
thus
with
their
poor
praise
of
Mr.
B.
's
girl
,
they
think
they
have
made
a
fine
compliment
to
his
judgment
.
  
<EOS>
But
for
his
sake
(
for
as
to
my
own
,
I
am
not
solicitous
about
such
gentlemen
's
good
opinions
)
,
I
owe
them
a
spite
;
and
believe
,
I
shall
find
an
opportunity
to
come
out
of
their
debt
.
<EOS>
For
I
have
the
vanity
to
think
,
now
you
have
made
me
proud
by
your
kind
encouragements
and
approbation
,
that
the
country
girl
will
make
'em
look
about
them
,
with
all
their
genteel
contempts
,
which
they
miscall
praise
.
  
<EOS>
But
how
I
run
on
!
<EOS>
Your
ladyship
expects
that
I
shall
write
as
freely
to
you
as
I
used
to
do
to
my
parents
.
<EOS>
I
have
the
merit
of
obeying
you
,
that
I
have
;
but
,
I
doubt
,
too
much
to
the
exercise
of
your
patience
.
  
<EOS>
This
(
like
all
mine
)
is
a
long
letter
;
and
I
will
only
add
to
it
Miss
Darnford
's
humble
respects
,
and
thanks
for
your
ladyship
's
kind
mention
of
her
,
which
she
receives
as
no
small
honour
.
  
<EOS>
And
now
.
<EOS>
Madam
,
with
a
greater
pleasure
than
I
can
express
,
will
I
make
use
of
the
liberty
you
so
kindly
allow
me
to
take
,
of
subscribing
myself
with
that
profound
respect
which
becomes
me
,
your
ladyship
's
most
obliged
sister
,
and
obedient
servant
,
P.B.
  
Mr.
Adams
,
Mr.
Longman
,
and
Mrs.
Jervis
,
are
just
arrived
;
and
our
household
is
now
complete
.
    
<EOS>
From
Lady
Davers
to
Mrs.
B.
  
MY
DEAR
PAMELA
,
  
After
I
have
thanked
you
for
your
last
agreeable
letter
,
which
has
added
the
Earl
and
Lady
Jenny
to
the
number
of
your
admirers
(
you
know
Lady
Betty
,
her
sister
,
was
so
before
)
<EOS>
,
I
shall
tell
you
,
that
I
now
write
,
at
their
requests
,
as
well
as
at
those
of
my
Lord
Davers
,
the
countess
you
so
dearly
love
,
and
Lady
Betty
,
for
your
decision
of
an
odd
dispute
,
that
,
on
reading
your
letter
,
and
talking
of
your
domestic
excellencies
,
happened
among
us
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Betty
says
,
that
,
notwithstanding
any
awkwardness
you
attribute
to
yourself
,
she
can
not
but
decide
,
by
all
she
has
seen
of
your
writings
,
and
heard
from
us
,
that
yours
is
the
perfectest
character
she
ever
found
in
the
sex
.
  
<EOS>
The
countess
said
,
that
you
wrong
yourself
in
supposing
you
are
not
every
thing
that
is
polite
and
genteel
,
as
well
in
your
behaviour
,
as
in
your
person
;
and
that
she
knows
not
any
lady
in
England
who
better
becomes
her
station
than
you
do
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
then
,
"
said
Lady
Jenny
,
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
B.
must
be
quite
perfect
:
that
's
certain
.
"
<EOS>
So
said
the
earl
;
so
said
they
all
.
<EOS>
And
Lord
Davers
confirmed
that
you
were
.
  
<EOS>
Yet
,
as
we
are
sure
,
there
can
not
be
such
a
character
in
this
life
as
has
not
one
fault
,
although
we
could
not
tell
where
to
fix
it
,
the
countess
made
a
whimsical
motion
:
<EOS>
"
Lady
Davers
,
"
said
she
,
"
pray
do
you
write
to
Mrs.
B.
and
acquaint
her
with
our
subject
;
and
as
it
is
impossible
,
for
one
who
can
act
as
she
does
,
not
to
know
herself
better
than
any
body
else
can
do
,
desire
her
to
acquaint
us
with
some
of
those
secret
foibles
,
that
leave
room
for
her
to
be
still
more
perfect
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
good
thought
,
"
said
they
all
.
<EOS>
And
this
is
the
present
occasion
of
my
writing
;
and
pray
see
that
you
accuse
yourself
,
of
no
more
than
you
know
yourself
guilty
:
for
over
-
modesty
borders
nearly
on
pride
,
and
too
liberal
self
-
accusations
are
generally
but
so
many
traps
for
acquittal
with
applause
:
so
that
(
whatever
other
ladies
might
)
you
will
not
be
forgiven
,
if
you
deal
with
us
in
a
way
so
poorly
artful
;
let
your
faults
,
therefore
,
be
such
as
you
think
we
can
subscribe
to
,
from
what
we
have
seen
of
you
and
what
we
have
read
of
yours
;
and
you
must
try
to
extenuate
them
too
,
as
you
give
them
,
lest
we
should
think
you
above
that
nature
,
which
,
in
the
best
cases
,
is
your
undoubted
talent
.
  
<EOS>
I
congratulate
you
and
Miss
Damford
on
her
arrival
:
she
is
a
charming
young
lady
;
but
tell
her
,
that
we
shall
not
allow
her
to
take
you
at
your
word
,
and
to
think
that
she
excels
you
in
any
one
thing
:
<EOS>
only
,
indeed
,
we
think
you
nicer
in
some
points
<EOS>
than
you
need
be
to
,
as
to
your
present
agreeable
circumstance
.
<EOS>
And
yet
,
let
me
tell
you
,
that
the
easy
,
unaffected
,
conjugal
purity
,
in
word
and
behaviour
,
between
your
good
man
and
you
,
is
worthy
of
imitation
,
and
what
the
countess
<EOS>
and
I
have
with
pleasure
contemplated
since
we
left
you
,
an
hundred
times
,
and
admire
in
you
both
:
and
it
is
good
policy
too
,
child
,
as
well
as
high
decorum
;
for
it
is
what
will
make
you
ever
new
and
respectful
to
one
another
.
  
<EOS>
But
you
have
the
honour
of
it
all
,
<EOS>
whose
sweet
,
natural
,
and
easy
modesty
,
in
person
,
behaviour
,
and
conversation
,
forbid
indecency
,
even
in
thought
,
much
more
in
word
,
to
approach
you
:
insomuch
that
no
rakes
can
be
rakes
in
your
presence
,
and
yet
they
hardly
know
to
what
they
owe
their
restraint
.
  
<EOS>
However
,
as
people
who
see
you
at
this
time
,
will
take
it
for
granted
that
you
and
Mr.
B.
have
been
very
intimate
together
,
I
should
think
you
need
not
be
ashamed
of
your
appearance
,
because
,
as
he
rightly
observes
,
you
have
no
reason
to
be
ashamed
of
your
husband
.
  
<EOS>
Excuse
my
pleasantry
,
my
dear
:
and
answer
our
demand
upon
you
,
as
soon
as
you
can
;
which
will
oblige
us
all
;
particularly
your
affectionate
sister
,
  
B.
DAVERS
.
    
<EOS>
MY
DEAREST
LADY
,
  
<EOS>
What
a
task
have
you
imposed
upon
me
!
<EOS>
And
according
to
the
terms
you
annex
to
it
,
how
shall
I
acquit
myself
of
it
,
without
incurring
the
censure
of
affectation
,
if
I
freely
accuse
myself
as
I
may
deserve
,
or
of
vanity
,
if
I
do
not
?
<EOS>
Indeed
,
Madam
,
I
have
a
great
many
failings
:
and
you
do
n't
know
the
pain
it
costs
me
to
keep
them
under
;
not
so
much
for
fear
the
world
should
see
them
,
<EOS>
for
I
bless
God
,
I
can
hope
they
are
not
capital
,
as
for
fear
they
should
become
capital
,
if
I
were
to
let
them
grow
upon
me
.
  
<EOS>
And
this
,
surely
,
I
need
not
have
told
your
ladyship
,
and
the
Countess
of
C.
,
who
have
read
my
papers
,
and
seen
my
behaviour
in
the
kind
visit
you
made
to
your
dear
brother
,
and
had
from
both
but
too
much
reason
to
censure
me
,
did
not
your
generous
and
partial
favour
<EOS>
make
you
overlook
my
greater
failings
,
and
pass
under
a
kinder
name
many
of
my
lesser
;
for
surely
,
my
good
ladies
,
you
must
both
of
you
have
observed
,
in
what
you
have
read
and
seen
,
that
I
am
naturally
of
a
saucy
temper
:
<EOS>
and
with
all
my
appearance
of
meekness
and
humility
,
can
resent
,
and
sting
too
,
when
I
think
myself
provoked
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
also
discovered
in
myself
,
on
many
occasions
(
of
some
of
which
I
will
by
-
and
-
by
remind
your
ladyship
)
,
a
malignancy
of
heart
,
that
,
it
is
true
,
lasts
but
a
little
while
 
nor
had
it
need
 
but
for
which
I
have
often
called
myself
to
account
 
to
very
little
purpose
hitherto
.
  
<EOS>
And
,
indeed
,
Madam
(
now
for
a
little
extenuation
,
as
you
expect
from
me
)
,
I
have
some
difficulty
,
whether
I
ought
to
take
such
pains
to
subdue
myself
in
some
instances
,
in
the
station
to
which
I
am
raised
,
that
otherwise
it
would
have
become
me
to
attempt
to
do
:
for
it
is
no
easy
task
,
for
one
in
my
circumstances
,
to
distinguish
between
the
ought
and
the
ought
not
;
to
be
humble
without
meanness
,
and
decent
without
arrogance
.
<EOS>
And
if
all
persons
thought
as
justly
as
I
flatter
myself
I
do
,
of
the
inconveniences
,
as
well
as
conveniences
,
which
attend
their
being
raised
to
a
condition
above
them
,
they
would
not
imagine
all
the
world
was
their
own
,
when
they
came
to
be
distinguished
as
I
have
been
:
for
,
<EOS>
what
with
the
contempts
of
superior
relations
on
one
side
,
the
envy
of
the
world
,
and
low
reflections
arising
from
it
,
on
the
other
,
from
which
no
one
must
hope
to
be
totally
exempted
,
and
the
awkwardness
,
besides
,
with
which
they
support
their
elevated
condition
,
if
they
have
sense
to
judge
of
their
own
imperfections
;
and
if
the
gentleman
be
not
such
an
one
as
mine
(
and
where
will
such
another
be
found
?
)
 
<EOS>
On
all
these
accounts
,
I
say
,
they
will
be
made
sensible
,
that
,
whatever
they
might
once
think
,
happiness
and
an
high
estate
are
two
very
different
things
.
  
<EOS>
But
I
shall
be
too
grave
,
when
your
ladyship
,
and
all
my
kind
and
noble
friends
,
expect
,
perhaps
,
I
should
give
the
uncommon
subject
a
pleasanter
air
:
yet
what
must
that
mind
be
,
that
is
not
serious
,
when
obliged
to
recollect
,
and
give
account
of
its
defects
?
  
<EOS>
But
I
must
not
only
accuse
myself
<EOS>
,
it
seems
,
I
must
give
proofs
,
such
as
your
ladyship
can
subscribe
to
,
of
my
imperfections
.
<EOS>
There
is
so
much
real
kindness
in
this
seeming
hardship
,
that
I
will
obey
you
.
<EOS>
Madam
,
and
produce
proofs
in
a
moment
,
which
can
not
be
controverted
.
  
<EOS>
As
to
my
sauciness
,
those
papers
will
give
an
hundred
instances
against
me
,
as
well
to
your
dear
brother
,
as
to
others
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
to
extenuate
,
as
you
command
me
,
as
I
go
along
,
these
were
mostly
when
I
was
apprehensive
for
my
honour
,
they
were
.
  
<EOS>
And
then
,
I
have
a
little
tincture
of
jealousy
,
which
sometimes
has
made
me
more
uneasy
than
I
ought
to
be
,
as
the
papers
you
have
not
seen
would
have
demonstrated
,
particularly
in
Miss
Godfrey
's
case
,
and
in
my
conversation
with
your
ladyships
,
in
which
I
have
frequently
betrayed
my
fears
of
what
might
happen
when
in
London
:
<EOS>
yet
,
to
extenuate
again
,
I
have
examined
myself
very
strictly
on
this
head
;
and
really
think
,
that
I
can
ascribe
a
great
part
of
this
jealousy
to
laudable
motives
;
no
less
than
to
my
concern
for
your
dear
brother
's
future
happiness
,
in
the
hope
,
that
I
may
be
a
humble
means
,
through
Providence
,
to
induce
him
to
abhor
those
crimes
of
which
young
gentlemen
too
often
are
guilty
,
and
bring
him
over
to
the
practice
of
those
virtues
,
in
which
he
will
ever
have
cause
to
rejoice
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
,
my
lady
,
some
other
parts
of
the
charge
must
stand
against
me
;
for
as
I
love
his
person
,
as
well
as
his
mind
,
I
have
pride
in
my
jealousy
,
that
would
not
permit
me
,
I
verily
think
,
to
support
myself
as
I
ought
,
under
trial
of
a
competition
,
in
this
very
tender
point
.
  
<EOS>
And
this
obliges
me
to
own
<EOS>
,
that
I
have
a
little
spark
 
not
a
little
one
,
perhaps
of
secret
pride
and
vanity
,
that
will
arise
,
now
and
then
,
on
the
honours
done
me
;
but
which
I
keep
under
as
much
as
I
can
;
and
to
this
pride
,
let
me
tell
your
ladyship
<EOS>
,
I
know
no
one
contributes
,
or
can
contribute
,
more
largely
than
yourself
.
  
<EOS>
So
you
see
,
<EOS>
my
dear
lady
,
what
a
naughty
heart
I
have
,
and
how
far
I
am
from
being
a
faultless
creature
 
<EOS>
I
hope
I
shall
be
better
and
better
,
however
,
as
I
live
longer
,
and
have
more
grace
,
and
more
wit
:
for
here
to
recapitulate
my
faults
,
is
in
the
first
place
,
vindictiveness
,
<EOS>
I
will
not
call
it
downright
revenge
 
<EOS>
And
how
much
room
do
all
these
leave
for
amendment
,
and
greater
perfection
?
  
<EOS>
Had
your
ladyship
,
and
the
countess
,
favoured
us
longer
in
your
kind
visit
<EOS>
,
I
must
have
so
improved
,
by
your
charming
conversations
,
and
by
that
natural
ease
and
dignity
which
accompany
everything
your
ladyships
do
and
say
,
as
to
have
got
over
such
of
these
foibles
as
are
not
rooted
in
nature
:
till
in
time
I
had
been
able
to
do
more
than
emulate
those
perfections
,
which
at
present
,
I
can
only
at
an
awful
distance
revere
;
as
becomes
,
my
dear
ladies
,
your
most
humble
admirer
,
and
obliged
servant
,

MY
EVER
-
HONOURED
PAPA
AND
MAMMA
,
  
<EOS>
I
arrived
safely
in
London
on
Thursday
,
after
a
tolerable
journey
,
considering
Deb
<EOS>
and
I
made
six
in
the
coach
<EOS>
(
two
having
been
taken
up
on
the
way
,
after
you
left
me
)
,
and
none
of
the
six
highly
agreeable
.
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
and
his
lady
,
who
looks
very
stately
upon
us
(
from
the
circumstance
of
person
,
rather
than
of
mind
,
however
)
,
were
so
good
as
to
meet
me
at
St.
Alban
's
,
in
their
coach
and
six
.
<EOS>
They
have
a
fine
house
here
,
richly
furnished
in
every
part
,
and
have
allotted
me
the
best
apartment
in
it
.
  
<EOS>
We
are
happy
beyond
expression
.
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
is
a
charming
husband
;
so
easy
,
so
pleased
with
,
and
so
tender
of
his
lady
:
<EOS>
and
she
so
much
all
that
we
saw
her
in
the
country
,
as
to
humility
and
affability
,
and
improved
in
every
thing
else
which
we
hardly
thought
possible
she
could
be
 
that
I
never
knew
so
happy
a
matrimony
.
 
<EOS>
All
that
prerogative
sauciness
,
which
we
apprehended
would
so
eminently
display
itself
in
his
behaviour
to
his
wife
,
had
she
been
ever
so
distinguished
by
birth
and
fortune
,
is
vanished
.
<EOS>
I
did
not
think
it
was
in
the
power
of
an
angel
,
if
our
sex
could
have
produced
one
,
to
have
made
so
tender
and
so
fond
<EOS>
a
husband
of
Mr.
B.
as
he
makes
.
<EOS>
And
should
I
have
the
sense
to
follow
Mrs.
B.
's
example
,
if
ever
I
marry
,
I
should
not
despair
of
making
myself
happy
<EOS>
,
let
it
be
to
whom
it
would
,
provided
he
was
not
a
brute
,
nor
sordid
in
his
temper
;
which
two
characters
are
too
obvious
to
be
concealed
,
if
persons
take
due
care
,
and
make
proper
inquiries
,
and
if
they
are
not
led
by
blind
passion
.
<EOS>
May
Mr.
Murray
and
Miss
Nancy
make
just
such
a
happy
pair
!
  
<EOS>
You
commanded
me
,
my
honoured
mamma
,
to
write
to
you
an
account
of
every
thing
that
pleased
me
 
<EOS>
I
said
I
would
:
<EOS>
but
what
a
task
should
I
then
have
!
 
<EOS>
I
did
not
think
I
had
undertaken
to
write
volumes
.
 
<EOS>
You
must
therefore
allow
me
to
be
more
brief
than
I
had
intended
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
first
place
,
it
would
take
up
five
or
six
long
letters
to
do
justice
to
the
economy
observed
in
this
happy
family
.
<EOS>
You
know
that
Mrs.
B.
has
not
changed
one
of
her
servants
,
and
only
added
her
Polly
to
them
.
<EOS>
This
is
an
unexampled
thing
,
especially
as
they
were
her
fellow
-
servants
as
we
may
say
:
but
since
they
have
the
sense
to
admire
so
good
an
example
,
and
are
proud
to
follow
it
,
each
to
his
and
her
power
,
I
think
it
one
of
her
peculiar
facilities
to
have
continued
them
,
and
to
choose
to
reform
such
as
were
exceptionable
rather
than
dismiss
them
.
  
<EOS>
Their
mouths
,
Deb
tells
me
,
are
continually
full
of
their
lady
's
praises
,
and
prayers
,
and
blessings
,
uttered
with
such
delight
and
fervour
for
the
happy
pair
,
that
it
makes
her
eyes
,
she
says
,
ready
to
run
over
to
hear
them
.
  
<EOS>
Moreover
,
I
think
it
an
extraordinary
degree
of
policy
(
whether
designed
or
not
)
to
keep
them
,
as
they
were
all
worthy
folks
;
for
had
she
turned
them
off
,
what
had
she
done
but
made
as
many
enemies
as
she
had
discarded
servants
;
and
as
many
more
as
those
had
friends
and
acquaintance
?
<EOS>
And
we
all
know
,
how
much
the
reputation
of
families
lies
at
the
mercy
of
servants
;
and
it
is
easy
to
guess
to
what
cause
each
would
have
imputed
his
or
her
dismission
.
<EOS>
And
so
she
has
escaped
,
as
she
ought
,
the
censure
of
pride
;
and
made
every
one
,
instead
of
reproaching
her
with
her
descent
,
find
those
graces
in
her
,
which
turn
that
very
disadvantage
to
her
glory
.
  
<EOS>
She
is
exceedingly
affable
;
always
speaks
to
them
with
a
smile
;
but
yet
has
such
a
dignity
in
her
manner
,
that
it
secures
her
their
respect
and
reverence
;
and
they
are
ready
to
fly
at
a
look
,
and
seem
proud
to
have
her
commands
to
execute
;
insomuch
,
that
the
words
 
"
My
lady
commands
so
,
or
so
,
"
from
one
servant
to
another
,
are
sure
to
meet
with
an
indisputable
obedience
,
be
the
duty
required
what
it
will
.
  
<EOS>
If
any
of
them
are
the
least
indisposed
,
her
care
and
tenderness
for
them
engage
the
veneration
and
gratitude
of
all
the
rest
,
who
see
how
kindly
they
will
be
treated
,
should
they
ail
any
thing
themselves
.
<EOS>
And
in
all
this
she
is
very
happy
in
Mrs.
Jervis
,
who
is
an
excellent
second
to
her
admirable
lady
;
and
is
treated
by
her
with
as
much
respect
and
affection
,
as
if
she
was
her
mother
.
  
<EOS>
You
may
remember
,
Madam
,
that
in
the
account
she
gave
us
of
her
benevolent
round
,
as
Lady
Davers
calls
it
,
she
says
,
that
as
she
was
going
to
London
,
she
should
instruct
Mrs.
Jervis
about
some
of
her
clients
,
as
I
find
she
calls
her
poor
,
to
avoid
a
word
which
her
delicacy
accounts
harsh
with
regard
to
them
,
and
ostentatious
with
respect
to
herself
.
<EOS>
I
asked
her
,
how
(
since
,
contrary
to
her
then
expectation
,
Mrs.
Jervis
was
permitted
to
be
in
town
with
her
)
<EOS>
she
had
provided
to
answer
her
intention
as
to
those
her
clients
,
whom
she
had
referred
to
the
care
of
that
good
woman
?
  
<EOS>
She
said
,
that
Mr.
Barlow
,
her
apothecary
,
was
a
very
worthy
man
,
and
she
had
given
him
a
plenary
power
in
that
particular
,
and
likewise
desired
him
to
recommend
any
new
and
worthy
case
to
her
that
no
deserving
person
among
the
destitute
sick
poor
,
might
be
unrelieved
by
reason
of
her
absence
.
  
<EOS>
And
here
in
London
she
has
applied
herself
to
Dr.
#
#
#
#
(
her
parish
minister
,
a
fine
preacher
,
and
<EOS>
sound
divine
,
who
promises
on
all
opportunities
to
pay
his
respects
to
Mr.
B.
)
to
recommend
to
her
any
poor
housekeepers
,
who
would
be
glad
to
accept
of
some
private
benefactions
,
and
yet
,
having
lived
creditably
,
till
reduced
by
misfortunes
,
are
ashamed
to
apply
for
public
relief
:
and
she
has
several
of
these
already
on
her
benevolent
list
,
to
some
of
whom
she
sends
coals
now
at
the
entrance
on
the
wintry
season
,
to
some
a
piece
of
Irish
or
Scottish
linen
,
or
so
many
yards
of
Norwich
stuff
,
for
gowns
and
coats
for
the
girls
,
or
Yorkshire
cloth
for
the
boys
;
and
money
to
some
,
who
she
is
most
assured
will
lay
it
out
with
care
.
<EOS>
And
she
has
moreover
mortified
,
as
the
Scots
call
it
,
one
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
as
a
fund
for
loans
,
without
interest
,
of
five
,
ten
,
or
fifteen
,
but
not
exceeding
twenty
pounds
,
to
answer
some
present
exigence
in
some
honest
families
,
who
find
the
best
security
they
can
,
to
repay
it
in
a
given
time
;
and
this
fund
,
she
purposes
,
as
she
grows
richer
,
she
says
,
to
increase
;
and
estimates
pleasantly
her
worth
by
this
sum
,
saying
sometimes
,
"
Who
would
ever
have
thought
I
should
have
been
worth
one
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
<EOS>
so
soon
?
<EOS>
I
shall
be
a
rich
body
in
time
.
"
<EOS>
But
in
all
these
things
,
she
enjoins
secresy
,
which
the
doctor
has
promised
.
  
<EOS>
She
told
the
doctor
what
Mr.
Adams
's
office
is
in
her
family
;
and
hoped
,
she
said
,
he
would
give
her
his
sanction
to
it
;
assuring
him
,
that
she
thought
it
her
duty
to
ask
it
,
as
she
was
one
of
his
flock
,
and
he
,
on
that
account
,
her
principal
shepherd
,
which
made
a
spiritual
relation
between
them
,
the
requisites
of
which
,
on
her
part
,
were
not
to
be
dispensed
with
.
<EOS>
The
good
gentleman
very
cheerfully
and
applaudingly
gave
his
consent
;
and
when
she
told
him
how
well
Mr.
Adams
was
provided
for
,
and
that
she
would
apply
to
him
to
supply
her
with
a
town
chaplain
,
when
she
was
deprived
of
him
,
he
wished
that
the
other
duties
of
his
function
(
for
he
has
a
large
parish
)
would
permit
him
to
be
the
happy
person
himself
,
saying
,
that
till
she
was
supplied
to
her
mind
,
either
he
or
his
curate
would
take
care
that
so
laudable
a
method
should
be
kept
up
.
  
<EOS>
You
will
do
me
the
justice
,
Madam
,
to
believe
,
that
I
very
cheerfully
join
in
my
dear
friend
's
Sunday
duties
;
and
I
am
not
a
little
edified
,
with
the
good
example
,
and
the
harmony
and
good
-
will
that
this
excellent
method
preserves
in
the
family
.
  
<EOS>
I
must
own
<EOS>
I
never
saw
such
a
family
of
love
in
my
life
:
for
here
,
under
the
eye
of
the
best
of
mistresses
,
they
twice
every
Sunday
see
one
another
all
together
(
as
they
used
to
do
in
the
country
)
,
superior
as
well
as
inferior
servants
;
and
Deb
tells
me
,
after
Mrs.
B.
and
I
are
withdrawn
,
there
are
such
friendly
salutations
among
them
,
that
she
never
heard
the
like
 
<EOS>
"
Your
servant
,
good
Master
Longman
:
"
 
"
Your
servant
,
Master
Colbrand
,
"
cries
one
and
another
:
 
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
,
John
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
'm
glad
to
see
you
,
Abraham
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
All
blessedly
met
once
more
!
"
<EOS>
cries
Jonathan
,
the
venerable
butler
,
with
his
silver
hairs
,
as
Mrs.
B.
always
distinguishes
him
:
 
"
Good
Madam
Jervis
<EOS>
,
"
cries
another
,
"
you
look
purely
this
blessed
day
,
thank
God
!
"
<EOS>
And
they
return
to
their
several
vocations
,
so
light
,
so
easy
,
so
pleased
,
so
even
-
tempered
in
their
minds
,
as
their
cheerful
countenances
,
as
well
as
expressions
,
testify
,
that
it
is
a
heaven
of
a
house
:
and
being
wound
up
thus
constantly
once
a
week
,
at
least
,
like
a
good
eight
-
day
clock
,
<EOS>
no
piece
of
machinery
that
ever
was
made
is
so
regular
and
uniform
as
this
family
is
.
  
<EOS>
What
an
example
does
this
dear
lady
set
to
all
who
see
her
,
know
her
,
and
who
hear
of
her
;
how
happy
they
who
have
the
grace
to
follow
it
!
<EOS>
What
a
public
blessing
would
such
a
mind
as
hers
be
,
could
it
be
vested
with
the
robes
of
royalty
,
and
adorn
the
sovereign
dignity
!
<EOS>
But
what
are
the
princes
of
the
earth
,
look
at
them
in
every
nation
,
and
what
they
have
been
for
ages
past
,
compared
to
this
lady
?
<EOS>
who
acts
from
the
impulses
of
her
own
heart
,
unaided
in
most
cases
,
by
any
human
example
.
<EOS>
In
short
,
when
I
contemplate
her
innumerable
excellencies
,
and
that
sweetness
of
temper
,
and
universal
benevolence
,
which
shine
in
every
thing
she
says
and
does
,
I
can
not
sometimes
help
looking
upon
her
in
the
light
of
an
angel
,
dropped
down
from
heaven
,
and
received
into
bodily
organs
,
to
live
among
men
and
women
,
in
order
to
shew
what
the
first
of
the
species
was
designed
to
be
.
  
<EOS>
And
,
here
,
is
the
admiration
,
that
one
sees
all
these
duties
performed
in
such
an
easy
and
pleasant
manner
,
as
any
body
may
perform
them
;
for
they
interfere
not
with
any
parts
of
the
family
management
;
but
rather
aid
and
inspirit
<EOS>
every
one
in
the
discharge
of
all
their
domestic
services
;
and
,
moreover
,
keep
their
minds
in
a
state
of
preparation
for
the
more
solemn
duties
of
the
day
;
and
all
without
the
least
intermixture
of
affectation
,
enthusiasm
,
or
ostentation
.
<EOS>
O
my
dear
papa
and
mamma
,
permit
me
but
to
tarry
here
till
I
am
perfect
in
all
these
good
lessons
,
and
how
happy
shall
I
be
!
  
<EOS>
As
to
the
town
,
and
the
diversions
of
it
,
I
shall
not
trouble
you
with
any
accounts
,
as
,
from
your
former
thorough
knowledge
of
both
,
you
will
want
no
information
about
them
;
for
,
generally
speaking
,
all
who
reside
constantly
in
London
,
allow
,
that
there
is
little
other
difference
in
the
diversions
of
one
winter
and
another
,
than
such
as
are
in
clothes
;
a
few
variations
of
the
fashions
only
,
which
are
mostly
owing
to
the
ingenious
contrivances
of
persons
who
are
to
get
their
bread
by
diversifying
them
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
B.
has
undertaken
to
give
Lady
Davers
an
account
of
the
matters
as
they
pass
,
and
her
sentiments
on
what
she
sees
.
<EOS>
There
must
be
something
new
in
her
observations
,
because
she
is
a
stranger
to
these
diversions
,
and
unbiassed
entirely
by
favour
or
prejudice
;
and
so
will
not
play
the
partial
critic
,
but
give
to
a
beauty
its
due
praise
,
and
to
a
fault
its
due
censure
,
according
to
that
truth
and
nature
which
are
the
unerring
guides
of
her
actions
as
well
as
sentiments
.
<EOS>
These
I
will
transcribe
for
you
;
and
you
'll
be
so
good
as
to
return
them
when
perused
,
because
I
will
lend
them
,
as
I
used
to
do
her
letters
,
to
her
good
parents
;
and
so
I
shall
give
her
a
pleasure
at
the
same
time
in
the
accommodating
them
with
the
knowledge
of
all
that
passes
,
<EOS>
which
she
makes
it
a
point
of
duty
to
do
,
because
they
take
delight
in
her
writings
.
  
<EOS>
My
papa
's
observation
,
that
a
woman
never
takes
a
journey
<EOS>
but
she
forgets
something
,
is
justified
by
me
;
for
,
with
all
my
care
,
I
have
left
my
diamond
buckle
,
which
Miss
Nancy
will
find
in
the
inner
till
of
my
bureau
,
wrapt
up
in
cotton
;
and
I
beg
it
may
be
sent
me
by
the
first
opportunity
.
<EOS>
With
my
humble
duty
to
you
both
,
my
dear
indulgent
papa
and
mamma
,
thanks
for
the
favour
I
now
rejoice
in
,
and
affectionate
respects
to
Miss
Nancy
(
I
wish
she
would
love
me
as
well
as
I
love
her
)
,
and
service
to
Mr.
Murray
,
and
all
our
good
neighbours
,
conclude
me
your
dutiful
,
and
highly
-
favoured
daughter
,
  
M.
DARNFORD
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
and
Mrs.
B
,
desire
their
compliments
of
congratulation
to
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Peters
,
on
the
marriage
of
their
worthy
niece
;
also
to
your
honoured
selves
they
desire
their
kind
respects
and
thanks
for
the
loan
of
your
worthless
daughter
.
<EOS>
I
experience
every
hour
some
new
token
of
their
politeness
and
affection
;
and
I
make
no
scruple
to
think
I
am
with
such
a
brother
,
and
such
a
sister
as
any
happy
creature
may
rejoice
in
,
and
be
proud
of
.
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
I
can
not
but
repeat
,
is
a
charming
husband
,
and
a
most
polite
gentleman
.
<EOS>
His
lady
is
always
accusing
herself
to
me
of
awkwardness
and
insufficiency
;
but
not
a
soul
who
sees
her
can
find
it
out
;
she
is
all
genteel
ease
;
and
the
admiration
of
every
one
who
beholds
her
.
<EOS>
Only
I
tell
her
,
with
such
happiness
in
possession
,
she
is
a
little
of
the
gravest
sometimes
.
    
<EOS>
From
Mrs.
B.
to
Lady
Davers
.
  
<EOS>
MY
GOOD
LADY
,
  
<EOS>
You
command
me
to
acquaint
you
with
the
proceedings
between
Mr.
Murray
and
Miss
Nanny
Darnford
:
and
Miss
Polly
makes
it
easy
for
me
to
obey
you
in
this
particular
,
and
in
very
few
words
;
for
she
says
,
every
thing
was
adjusted
before
she
came
away
,
and
the
ceremony
,
she
believes
,
may
be
performed
by
this
time
.
<EOS>
She
rejoices
that
she
was
out
of
the
way
of
it
:
for
,
she
says
,
love
is
so
awkward
a
thing
to
Mr.
Murray
,
and
good
-
humour
so
uncommon
an
one
to
Miss
Nancy
,
that
she
hopes
she
shall
never
see
such
another
courtship
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
been
at
the
play
-
house
several
time
;
and
,
give
me
leave
to
say
,
Madam
,
(
for
I
have
now
read
as
well
as
seen
several
)
,
that
I
think
the
stage
,
by
proper
regulations
,
might
be
made
a
profitable
amusement
.
 
<EOS>
But
nothing
more
convinces
one
of
the
truth
of
the
common
observation
,
that
the
best
things
,
corrupted
,
prove
the
worst
,
than
these
representations
.
<EOS>
The
terror
and
compunction
for
evil
deeds
,
the
compassion
for
a
just
distress
,
and
the
general
beneficence
which
those
lively
exhibitions
are
so
capable
of
raising
in
the
human
mind
,
might
be
of
great
service
,
when
directed
to
right
ends
,
and
induced
by
proper
motives
:
particularly
where
the
actions
which
the
catastrophe
is
designed
to
punish
,
are
not
set
in
such
advantageous
lights
,
as
shall
destroy
the
end
of
the
moral
,
and
make
the
vice
that
ought
to
be
censured
,
imitable
;
where
instruction
is
kept
in
view
all
the
way
,
and
where
vice
is
punished
,
and
virtue
rewarded
.
  
<EOS>
But
give
me
leave
to
say
,
<EOS>
that
I
think
there
is
hardly
one
play
I
have
seen
,
or
read
hitherto
,
but
has
too
much
of
love
in
it
,
as
that
passion
is
generally
treated
.
<EOS>
How
unnatural
in
some
,
how
inflaming
in
others
,
are
the
descriptions
of
it
!
 
<EOS>
In
most
,
rather
rant
and
fury
,
like
the
loves
of
the
fiercer
brute
animals
,
as
Virgil
,
translated
by
Dryden
,
describes
them
,
than
the
soft
,
sighing
,
fearfully
hopeful
murmurs
,
that
swell
the
bosoms
of
our
gentler
sex
:
and
the
respectful
,
timorous
,
submissive
complainings
of
the
other
,
when
the
truth
of
the
passion
humanizes
,
as
one
may
say
,
their
more
rugged
hearts
.
  
<EOS>
In
particular
,
what
strange
indelicates
do
these
writers
of
tragedy
often
make
of
our
sex
!
<EOS>
They
do
n't
enter
into
the
passion
at
all
,
if
I
have
any
notion
of
it
;
but
when
the
authors
want
to
paint
it
strongly
(
at
least
in
those
plays
I
have
seen
and
read
)
<EOS>
their
aim
seems
to
raise
a
whirlwind
,
as
I
may
say
,
which
sweeps
down
reason
,
religion
,
and
decency
;
and
carries
every
laudable
duty
away
before
it
;
so
that
all
the
examples
can
serve
to
shew
is
,
how
a
disappointed
lover
may
rage
and
storm
,
resent
and
revenge
.
  
<EOS>
The
play
I
first
saw
was
the
tragedy
of
The
Distressed
Mother
;
and
a
great
many
beautiful
things
I
think
there
are
in
it
:
but
half
of
it
is
a
tempestuous
,
cruel
,
ungoverned
rant
of
passion
,
and
ends
in
cruelty
,
bloodshed
,
and
desolation
,
which
the
truth
of
the
story
not
warranting
,
as
Mr.
B.
tells
me
,
makes
it
the
more
pity
,
that
the
original
author
(
for
it
is
a
French
play
,
translated
,
you
know
,
Madam
)
,
had
not
conducted
it
,
since
it
was
his
choice
,
with
less
terror
,
and
with
greater
propriety
,
to
the
passions
intended
to
be
raised
,
and
actually
raised
in
many
places
.
  
<EOS>
But
the
epilogue
spoken
after
the
play
,
by
Mrs.
Oldfield
,
in
the
character
of
Andromache
,
was
more
shocking
to
me
,
than
the
most
terrible
parts
of
the
play
;
as
by
lewd
and
even
senseless
double
entendre
,
it
could
be
calculated
only
to
efface
all
the
tender
,
all
the
virtuous
sentiments
,
which
the
tragedy
was
designed
to
raise
.
  
<EOS>
The
pleasure
this
gave
the
men
was
equally
barbarous
and
insulting
;
all
turning
to
the
boxes
,
pit
,
and
galleries
,
where
ladies
were
,
to
see
how
they
looked
,
and
stood
an
emphatical
and
too
-
well
pronounced
ridicule
,
not
only
upon
the
play
in
general
,
but
upon
the
part
of
Andromache
in
particular
,
which
had
been
so
well
sustained
by
an
excellent
actress
;
and
I
was
extremely
mortified
to
see
my
favourite
(
and
the
only
perfect
)
character
debased
and
despoiled
,
and
the
widow
of
Hector
,
prince
of
Troy
,
talking
nastiness
to
an
audience
,
and
setting
it
out
with
all
the
wicked
graces
of
action
,
and
affected
archness
of
look
,
attitude
,
and
emphasis
.
  
<EOS>
I
stood
up
 
"
Dear
Sir
!
 
<EOS>
Dear
Miss
!
"
said
I.
  
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
matter
,
my
love
?
"
said
Mr.
B.
smiling
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
have
I
wept
the
distresses
of
the
injured
Hermione
?
"
<EOS>
whispered
I
:
<EOS>
"
why
have
I
been
moved
by
the
murder
of
the
brave
Pyrrhus
,
and
shocked
by
the
madness
of
Orestes
!
<EOS>
Is
it
for
this
?
<EOS>
See
you
not
Hector
's
widow
,
the
noble
Andromache
,
inverting
the
design
of
the
whole
play
,
satirizing
her
own
sex
,
but
indeed
most
of
all
ridiculing
and
shaming
,
in
my
mind
,
that
part
of
the
audience
,
who
can
be
delighted
with
this
vile
epilogue
,
after
such
scenes
of
horror
and
distress
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
was
pleased
to
say
,
smiling
,
"
I
expected
,
my
dear
,
that
your
delicacy
,
and
Miss
Darnford
's
too
,
would
be
shocked
on
this
preposterous
occasion
.
<EOS>
I
never
saw
this
play
,
rake
as
I
was
,
but
the
impropriety
of
the
epilogue
sent
me
away
dissatisfied
with
it
,
and
with
human
nature
too
:
and
you
only
see
,
by
this
one
instance
,
what
a
character
that
of
an
actor
or
actress
is
,
and
how
capable
they
are
to
personate
any
thing
for
a
sorry
subsistence
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Well
,
but
,
Sir
,
"
said
I
,
"
are
there
not
,
think
you
,
extravagant
scenes
and
characters
enough
in
most
plays
to
justify
the
censures
of
the
virtuous
upon
them
,
that
the
wicked
friend
of
the
author
must
crown
the
work
in
an
epilogue
,
for
fear
the
audience
should
go
away
improved
by
the
representation
?
<EOS>
It
is
not
,
I
see
,
always
narrowness
of
spirit
,
as
I
have
heard
some
say
,
that
opens
the
mouths
of
good
people
against
these
diversions
.
"
  
<EOS>
In
this
wild
way
talked
I
;
for
I
was
quite
out
of
patience
at
this
unnatural
and
unexpected
piece
of
ridicule
,
tacked
to
so
serious
a
play
,
and
coming
after
such
a
moral
.
  
<EOS>
Here
is
a
specimen
,
my
dear
lady
,
of
my
observations
on
the
first
play
I
saw
.
<EOS>
How
just
or
how
impertinent
,
I
must
leave
to
your
better
judgment
.
<EOS>
I
very
probably
expose
my
ignorance
and
folly
in
them
,
but
I
will
not
say
presumption
,
because
you
have
put
me
upon
the
task
,
which
otherwise
I
should
hardly
have
attempted
.
<EOS>
I
have
very
little
reason
therefore
to
blame
myself
on
this
score
;
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
if
I
can
escape
your
ladyship
's
censure
,
have
cause
to
pride
myself
in
the
opportunity
you
have
thereby
given
me
to
shew
my
readiness
to
obey
you
;
and
the
rather
,
since
I
am
sure
of
your
kindest
indulgence
,
now
you
have
given
me
leave
to
style
myself
your
ladyship
's
obliged
sister
,
and
humble
servant
,
  
P.B.
    
MY
DEAR
LADY
,
  
<EOS>
I
gave
you
in
my
last
my
bold
remarks
upon
a
TRAGEDY
-
The
Distressed
Mother
.
<EOS>
I
will
now
give
you
my
shallow
notions
of
a
COMEDY
 
The
Tender
Husband
.
  
<EOS>
I
liked
this
part
of
the
title
;
though
I
was
not
pleased
with
the
other
,
explanatory
of
it
;
Or
 
The
Accomplished
Fools
.
<EOS>
But
when
I
heard
it
was
written
by
Sir
Richard
Steele
,
and
that
Mr.
Addison
had
given
some
hints
towards
it
,
if
not
some
characters
 
<EOS>
"
O
,
dear
Sir
,
"
said
I
,
"
give
us
your
company
to
this
play
;
for
the
authors
of
the
Spectator
can
not
possibly
produce
a
faulty
scene
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
indeed
smiled
;
for
I
had
not
then
read
the
play
:
and
the
Earl
of
F.
,
his
countess
,
Miss
Darnford
,
Mr.
B.
and
myself
,
agreed
to
meet
with
a
niece
of
my
lord
's
in
the
stage
-
box
,
which
was
taken
on
purpose
.
  
<EOS>
There
seemed
to
me
to
be
much
wit
and
satire
in
the
play
:
but
,
upon
my
word
,
I
was
grievously
disappointed
as
to
the
morality
of
it
;
nor
,
in
some
places
,
is
 
probability
preserved
;
and
there
are
divers
speeches
so
very
free
,
that
I
could
not
have
expected
to
meet
with
such
,
from
the
names
I
mentioned
.
  
<EOS>
In
short
the
author
seems
to
have
forgotten
the
moral
all
the
way
;
and
being
put
in
mind
of
it
by
some
kind
friend
(
Mr.
Addison
,
perhaps
)
,
was
at
a
loss
to
draw
one
from
such
characters
and
plots
as
he
had
produced
;
and
so
put
down
what
came
uppermost
,
for
the
sake
of
custom
,
without
much
regard
to
propriety
.
<EOS>
And
truly
,
I
should
think
,
that
the
play
was
begun
with
a
design
to
draw
more
amiable
characters
,
answerable
to
the
title
of
The
Tender
Husband
;
but
that
the
author
,
being
carried
away
by
the
luxuriancy
of
a
genius
,
which
he
had
not
the
heart
to
prune
,
on
a
general
survey
of
the
whole
,
distrusting
the
propriety
of
that
title
,
added
the
under
one
:
with
an
OR
,
The
Accomplished
Fools
,
in
justice
to
his
piece
,
and
compliment
to
his
audience
.
<EOS>
Had
he
called
it
<EOS>
The
Accomplished
Knaves
,
I
would
not
have
been
angry
at
him
,
because
there
would
have
been
more
propriety
in
the
title
.
  
<EOS>
I
wish
I
could
,
for
the
sake
of
the
authors
,
have
praised
every
scene
of
this
play
:
I
hoped
to
have
reason
for
it
.
<EOS>
Judge
then
,
my
dear
lady
,
my
mortification
,
not
to
be
able
to
say
I
liked
above
one
,
the
Painter
's
scene
,
which
too
was
out
of
time
,
being
on
the
wedding
-
day
;
and
am
forced
to
disapprove
of
every
character
in
it
,
and
the
views
of
every
one
.
<EOS>
I
am
,
dear
Madam
,
your
most
obliged
sister
and
servant
,
  
P.B.
    
<EOS>
My
Dear
Lady
,
  
<EOS>
Although
I
can
not
tell
how
you
received
my
observations
on
the
tragedy
of
The
Distressed
Mother
,
and
the
comedy
of
The
Tender
Husband
,
yet
will
I
proceed
to
give
your
ladyship
my
opinion
of
the
opera
<EOS>
I
was
at
last
night
.
  
<EOS>
But
what
can
I
say
,
after
mentioning
what
you
<EOS>
so
well
<EOS>
know
,
the
fine
scenes
,
the
genteel
and
splendid
company
,
the
charming
voices
,
and
delightful
music
?
  
<EOS>
If
,
Madam
,
one
were
all
ear
,
and
lost
to
every
sense
but
that
of
harmony
,
surely
the
Italian
opera
would
be
a
transporting
thing
!
 
<EOS>
But
when
one
finds
good
sense
,
and
instruction
,
and
propriety
,
sacrificed
to
the
charms
of
sound
,
what
an
unedifying
,
what
a
mere
temporary
delight
does
it
afford
!
<EOS>
For
what
does
one
carry
home
,
but
the
remembrance
of
having
been
pleased
so
many
hours
by
the
mere
vibration
of
air
,
which
,
being
but
sound
,
you
can
not
bring
away
with
you
;
and
must
therefore
enter
the
time
passed
in
such
a
diversion
,
into
the
account
of
those
blank
hours
,
from
which
one
has
not
reaped
so
much
as
one
improving
lesson
?
  
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
observes
,
that
when
once
sound
is
preferred
to
sense
,
we
shall
depart
from
all
our
own
worthiness
,
and
,
at
best
,
be
<EOS>
but
the
apes
,
yea
,
the
dupes
,
of
those
whom
we
may
strive
to
imitate
,
but
never
can
reach
,
much
less
excel
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
says
,
sometimes
,
that
this
taste
is
almost
the
only
good
fruit
our
young
nobility
gather
,
and
bring
home
from
their
foreign
tours
;
and
that
he
found
the
English
nation
much
ridiculed
on
this
score
,
by
those
very
people
who
are
benefited
by
their
depravity
.
<EOS>
And
if
this
be
the
best
,
what
must
the
other
qualifications
be
,
which
they
bring
home
?
 
<EOS>
Yet
every
one
does
not
return
with
so
little
improvement
,
it
is
to
be
hoped
.
  
<EOS>
But
what
can
I
say
of
an
Italian
opera
?
 
<EOS>
For
who
can
describe
sound
!
<EOS>
Or
what
words
shall
be
found
to
embody
air
?
<EOS>
And
when
we
return
,
and
are
asked
our
opinion
of
what
we
have
seen
or
heard
,
we
are
only
able
to
answer
,
as
I
hinted
above
the
scenery
<EOS>
is
fine
,
the
company
splendid
and
genteel
,
the
music
charming
for
the
time
,
the
action
not
extraordinary
,
the
language
unintelligible
,
and
,
for
all
these
reasons
 
<EOS>
the
instruction
none
at
all
.
  
<EOS>
This
is
all
the
thing
itself
gives
me
room
to
say
of
the
Italian
opera
;
very
probably
,
for
want
of
a
polite
taste
,
and
a
knowledge
of
the
language
.
  
<EOS>
In
my
next
,
I
believe
,
I
shall
give
you
,
Madam
,
my
opinion
of
a
diversion
,
which
,
I
doubt
,
I
shall
like
still
less
,
and
that
is
a
masquerade
;
<EOS>
for
I
fear
I
shall
not
be
excused
going
to
one
,
although
I
have
no
manner
of
liking
to
it
,
especially
in
my
present
way
.
<EOS>
I
am
.
<EOS>
Madam
,
your
ladyship
's
most
obliged
and
faithful
<EOS>
P.B.
  
<EOS>
I
must
add
another
half
sheet
to
this
letter
on
the
subject
matter
of
it
,
the
opera
;
and
am
sure
you
will
not
be
displeased
with
the
addition
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
coming
up
just
as
I
had
concluded
my
letter
,
asked
me
what
was
my
subject
?
<EOS>
I
told
him
I
was
giving
your
ladyship
my
notions
of
the
Italian
opera
.
"
<EOS>
Let
me
see
what
they
are
,
my
dear
;
for
this
is
a
subject
that
very
few
of
those
who
admire
these
performances
,
and
fewer
still
of
those
who
decry
them
,
know
any
thing
of
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
read
the
above
,
and
was
pleased
to
commend
it
.
<EOS>
"
Operas
,
"
said
he
,
"
are
very
sad
things
in
England
,
to
what
they
are
in
Italy
;
and
the
translations
given
of
them
abominable
:
and

<EOS>
"
Every
nation
,
as
you
say
,
has
its
excellencies
;
and
ours
should
not
quit
the
manly
nervous
sense
,
which
is
the
distinction
of
the
English
drama
.
<EOS>
One
play
of
our
celebrated
Shakespeare
will
give
infinitely
more
pleasure
to
a
sensible
mind
than
a
dozen
English
-
Italian
operas
.
<EOS>
But
,
my
dear
,
in
Italy
,
they
are
quite
another
thing
:
and
the
sense
is
not
,
as
here
,
sacrificed
so
much
to
the
sound
,
but
that
they
are
both
very
compatible
.
<EOS>

"
Be
pleased
,
Sir

to
give
me
your
observations

this
head

I

have
something

<EOS>
"
I
will

my

he
took
a
pen
,

wrote
the
inclosed
;
which
I
beg
your
ladyship
to
return
me
;
because
I

keep
it
for
my
instruction

I

talk
of
this
subject

company

In
Italy
,
judges
of
operas
are
so
far
from
thinking
the
drama
or
poetical
part
of
their
operas
nonsense
,
as
the
unskilled
in
Italian
rashly
conclude
in
England
,
that
if
the
Libretto
,
as
they
call
it
,
is
not
approved
,
the
opera
,
notwithstanding
the
excellence
of
the
music
,
will
be
condemned
.
<EOS>
For
the
Italians
justly
determine
,
that
the
very
music
of
an
opera
can
not
be
complete
and
pleasing
,
if
the
drama
be
incongruous
,
as
I
may
call
it
,
in
its
composition
,
because
,
in
order
to
please
,
it
must
have
the
necessary
contrast
of
the
grave
and
the
light
,
that
is
,
the
diverting
equally
blended
through
the
whole
.
<EOS>
If
there
be
too
much
of
the
first
,
let
the
music
be
composed
ever
so
masterly
in
that
style
,
it
will
become
heavy
and
tiresome
;
if
the
latter
prevail
,
it
will
surfeit
with
its
levity
<EOS>
:
wherefore
it
is
the
poet
's
business
to
adapt
the
words
for
this
agreeable
mixture
:
for
the
music
is
but
secondary
,
and
subservient
to
the
words
;
and
if
there
be
an
artful
contrast
in
the
drama
,
there
will
be
the
same
in
the
music
,
supposing
the
composer
to
be
a
skilful
master
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
since
in
England
,
the
practice
has
been
to
mutilate
,
curtail
,
and
patch
up
a
drama
in
Italian
,
in
order
to
introduce
favourite
airs
,
selected
from
different
authors
,
the
contrast
has
always
been
broken
thereby
,
without
every
one
's
knowing
the
reason
:
and
since
ignorant
mercenary
prompters
,
though
Italians
,
have
been
employed
in
hotch
-
potch
,
and
in
translating
our
dramas
from
Italian
into
English
,
how
could
such
operas
appear
any
other
than
incongruous
nonsense
?
"
  
<EOS>
Permit
me
,
dear
Madam
,
to
repeat
my
assurances
,
that
I
am
,
and
must
ever
be
,
your
obliged
sister

P.B.
    
<EOS>
Well
,
now
,
my
dear
lady
,
I
will
give
you
my
poor
opinion
of
a
masquerade
,
to
which
Mr.
B.
persuaded
me
to
accompany
Miss
Darnford
;
for
,
as
I
hinted
in
my
former
,
I
had
a
great
indifference
,
or
rather
dislike
,
to
go
,
and
Miss
therefore
wanted
so
powerful
a
second
,
to
get
me
with
her
;
because
I
was
afraid
<EOS>
the
freedoms
which
I
had
heard
were
used
there
,
would
not
be
very
agreeable
to
my
apprehensive
temper
,
at
this
time
especially
.
  
<EOS>
But
finding
Mr.
B.
chose
to
have
me
go
,
if
,
as
he
was
pleased
to
say
,
I
had
no
objection
,
"
I
said
,
I
will
have
none
<EOS>
,
I
can
have
none
,
when
you
tell
me
it
is
your
choice
;
and
so
send
for
the
habits
you
like
,
and
that
you
would
have
me
appear
in
,
and
I
will
cheerfully
attend
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
habit
Mr.
B.
pitched
upon
was
that
of
a
Spanish
Don
,
and
it
well
befitted
the
majesty
of
his
person
and
air
;
and
Miss
Darnford
chose
that
of
a
young
Widow
;
and
Mr.
B.
recommended
that
of
a
Quaker
for
me
.
<EOS>
We
all
admired
one
another
in
our
dresses
;
and
Mr.
B.
promising
to
have
me
always
in
his
eye
,
we
went
thither
.
  
<EOS>
But
I
never
desire
to
be
present
at
another
.
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
was
singled
out
by
a
bold
Nun
,
who
talked
Italian
to
him
with
such
free
airs
,
that
I
did
not
much
like
it
,
though
I
knew
not
what
she
said
;
for
I
thought
the
dear
gentleman
no
more
kept
to
his
Spanish
gravity
,
than
she
to
the
requisites
of
the
habit
she
wore
:
when
I
had
imagined
that
all
that
was
tolerable
in
a
masquerade
,
was
the
acting
up
to
the
character
each
person
assumed
:
and
this
gave
me
no
objection
to
the
Quaker
's
dress
;
for
I
thought
I
was
prim
enough
for
that
naturally
.
  
<EOS>
I
said
softly
,
"
Dear
Miss
Darnford
"
(
for
Mr.
B.
and
the
Nun
were
out
of
sight
in
a
moment
)
,
"
what
is
become
of
that
Nun
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Rather
,
"
whispered
she
,
"
what
is
become
of
the
Spaniard
?
"
  
<EOS>
A
Cardinal
attacked
me
instantly
in
French
;
but
I
answered
in
English
,
not
knowing
what
he
said
,
"
Quakers
are
not
fit
company
for
Red
-
hats
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
are
,
"
said
he
,
in
the
same
language
;
"
for
a
Quaker
and
a
Jesuit
is
the
same
thing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Darnford
was
addressed
by
the
name
of
the
Sprightly
Widow
:
<EOS>
another
asked
,
how
long
she
intended
to
wear
those
weeds
?
<EOS>
And
a
footman
,
in
a
rich
livery
,
answered
for
her
eyes
,
through
her
mask
,
that
it
would
not
be
a
month
.
  
<EOS>
But
I
was
startled
when
a
Presbyterian
Parson
came
up
,
and
bid
me
look
after
my
Musidorus
 
<EOS>
So
that
I
doubted
not
by
this
,
it
must
be
one
who
knew
my
name
to
be
Pamela
;
and
I
soon
thought
of
one
of
my
lawyers
,
whose
characters
I
gave
before
.
  
<EOS>
Indeed
,
he
needed
not
to
bid
me
;
for
I
was
sorry
,
on
more
accounts
than
that
of
my
timorousness
,
to
have
lost
sight
of
him
.
<EOS>
"
Out
upon
these
nasty
masquerades
!
"
thought
I
;
"
I
ca
n't
abide
them
already
!
"
  
<EOS>
An
egregious
beauish
appearance
came
up
to
Miss
,
and
said
,
"
You
hang
out
a
very
pretty
sign
,
Widow
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Not
,
"
replied
she
,
"
to
invite
such
fops
as
you
to
my
shop
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Any
customer
would
be
welcome
,
"
returned
he
,
"
in
my
opinion
.
<EOS>
I
whisper
this
as
a
secret
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
whisper
another
,
"
said
she
,
but
not
whisperingly
,
"
that
no
place
warrants
ill
manners
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Are
you
angry
,
Widow
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
affected
a
laugh
:
"
<EOS>
No
,
indeed
,
it
i'n't
worth
while
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
turned
to
me
 
<EOS>
and
I
was
afraid
of
some
such
hit
as
he
gave
me
.
<EOS>
"
I
hope
,
friend
,
thou
art
prepared
with
a
father
for
the
light
within
thee
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
this
wit
?
"
said
I
,
turning
to
Miss
Darnford
:
"
I
have
enough
of
this
diversion
,
where
nothing
but
coarse
jests
appear
barefac'd
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
At
last
Mr.
B.
accosted
us
,
as
if
he
had
not
known
us
.
"
<EOS>
So
lovely
a
widow
,
and
so
sweet
a
friend
!
<EOS>
no
wonder
you
do
not
separate
:
for
I
see
not
in
this
various
assembly
a
third
person
of
your
sex
fit
to
join
with
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
one
,
Sir
!
"
said
I.
"
Will
not
a
penitent
<EOS>
Nun
make
a
good
third
with
a
mournful
Widow
,
and
a
prim
Quaker
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
for
more
than
ten
minutes
at
most
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Instantly
the
Nun
,
a
fine
person
of
a
lady
,
with
a
noble
air
,
though
I
did
not
like
her
,
joined
us
,
and
spoke
in
Italian
something
very
free
,
as
it
seemed
by
her
manner
,
and
Mr.
B.
's
smiling
answer
;
but
neither
Miss
Darnford
nor
I
understood
that
language
,
and
Mr.
B.
would
not
explain
it
to
us
.
  
<EOS>
But
she
gave
him
a
signal
to
follow
her
,
seeming
to
be
much
taken
with
his
person
and
air
;
for
though
there
were
three
other
Spanish
habits
there
,
he
was
called
The
stately
Spaniard
by
one
,
The
handsome
Spaniard
by
another
,
in
our
hearing
,
as
he
passed
with
us
to
the
dessert
,
where
we
drank
each
of
us
a
glass
of
Champaign
,
and
eat
a
few
sweetmeats
,
with
a
crowd
about
us
;
but
we
appeared
not
to
know
one
another
:
while
several
odd
appearances
,
as
one
Indian
Prince
,
one
Chinese
Mandarin
,
several
Domino
's
,
of
both
sexes
,
a
Dutch
Skipper
,
a
Jewish
Rabbi
,
a
Greek
Monk
,
a
Harlequin
,
a
Turkish
Bashaw
,
and
Capuchin
Friar
,
glided
by
us
,
as
we
returned
into
company
,
signifying
that
we
were
strangers
to
them
by
squeaking
out
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
you
!
"
 
<EOS>
W
hich
is
half
the
wit
of
the
place
.
  
<EOS>
Two
ladies
,
one
in
a
very
fantastic
party
-
coloured
habit
,
with
a
plume
of
feathers
,
the
other
in
a
rustic
one
,
with
a
garland
of
flowers
round
her
head
,
were
much
taken
notice
of
for
their
freedom
,
and
having
something
to
say
to
every
body
.
<EOS>
They
were
as
seldom
separated
as
Miss
Darnford
and
I
,
and
were
followed
by
a
crowd
wherever
they
went
.
  
<EOS>
The
party
-
coloured
one
came
up
to
me
:
"
Friend
,
"
said
she
,
"
there
is
something
in
thy
person
that
attracts
every
one
's
notice
:
but
if
a
sack
had
not
been
a
profane
thing
,
it
would
have
become
thee
almost
as
well
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
thank
thee
,
friend
,
"
said
I
,
"
for
thy
counsel
;
but
if
thou
hadst
been
pleased
to
look
at
home
,
thou
wouldst
not
have
taken
so
much
pains
to
join
such
advice
,
and
<EOS>
such
an
appearance
,
together
,
as
thou
makest
!
"
  
<EOS>
This
made
every
one
that
heard
it
laugh
.
 
<EOS>
One
said
,
the
butterfly
hath
met
with
her
match
.
  
<EOS>
She
returned
,
with
an
affected
laugh
,
"
Smartly
said
!
 
<EOS>
But
art
thou
come
hither
,
friend
,
to
make
thy
light
shine
before
men
or
women
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Verily
,
friend
,
neither
,
"
replied
I
:
"
but
out
of
mere
curiosity
,
to
look
into
the
minds
of
both
sexes
;
which
I
read
in
their
dresses
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
general
satire
on
the
assemblee
,
by
the
mass

<EOS>
"
said
a
fat
Monk
.
  
<EOS>
The
Nun
whisked
to
us
:
"
We
're
all
concerned
in
my
friend
's
remark
.
<EOS>
"
    
<EOS>
"
And
no
disgrace

returned
I
,
"
if
her
behaviour
answer
her
dress
 
<EOS>
Nor
to
a
reverend
Friar
,
"
turning
to
the
Monk
,
"
if
his
mind
be
not
a
discredit
to
his
appearance
 
<EOS>
Nor
yet
to
a
Country
-
girl
,
"
turning
to
the
party
-
coloured
lady
's
companion
,
"
if
she
has
not
weeds
in
her
heart
to
disgrace
the
flowers
on
her
head
.

<EOS>
An
odd
figure
,
representing
a
Merry
Andrew
,
took
my
hand
,
and
said
,
I
had
the
most
piquant
wit
he
had
met
with
that
night
:
"
<EOS>
And
,
friend
,
"
said
he
,
"
let
us
be
better
acquainted
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Forbear
,
"
said
I
,
withdrawing
my
hand
;
"
not
a
companion
for
a
Jack
-
pudding
,
neither
!
"
  
<EOS>
A
Roman
Senator
just
then
accosted
Miss
Darnford
;
and
Mr.
B.
seeing
me
so
much
engaged
,
"
'
<EOS>
Twere
hard
,
"
said
he
,
"
if
our
nation
,
in
spite
of
Cervantes
,
produced
not
one
cavalier
to
protect
a
fair
lady
thus
surrounded
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Though
surrounded
,
not
distressed
,
my
good
knight
-
errant
,
"
said
the
Nun
:
"
<EOS>
the
fair
Quaker
will
be
too
hard
for
half
-
a
-
dozen
antagonists
,
and
wants
not
your
protection
:
 
but
<EOS>
your
poor
Nun
bespeaks
it
,
"
whispered
she
,
"
who
has
not
a
word
to
say
for
herself
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
answered
her
in
Italian
(
I
wish
I
understood
Italian
!
)
 
<EOS>
and
she
had
recourse
to
her
beads
.
  
<EOS>
You
ca
n't
imagine
,
<EOS>
Madam
,
how
this
Nun
haunted
him
!
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
like
these
masquerades
at
all
.
<EOS>
Many
ladies
,
on
these
occasions
,
are
so
very
free
,
that
the
censorious
will
be
apt
to
blame
the
whole
sex
for
their
conduct
,
and
to
say
,
their
hearts
are
as
faulty
as
those
of
the
most
culpable
men
,
since
they
scruple
not
to
shew
as
much
,
when
they
think
they
can
not
be
known
by
their
faces
.
<EOS>
But
it
is
my
humble
opinion
,
that
could
a
standard
be
fixed
,
by
which
one
could
determine
readily
what
is
,
and
what
is
not
wit
,
decency
would
not
be
so
often
wounded
by
attempts
to
be
witty
,
as
it
is
.
<EOS>
For
here
every
one
,
who
can
say
things
that
shock
a
modester
person
,
not
meeting
with
due
rebuke
,
but
perhaps
a
smile
,
(
without
considering
whether
it
be
of
contempt
or
approbation
)
mistakes
courage
for
wit
;
and
every
thing
sacred
or
civil
becomes
the
subject
of
his
frothy
jest
.
  
<EOS>
But
what
a
moralizer
am
I
!
<EOS>
will
your
ladyship
say
:
indeed
I
ca
n't
help
it
:
 
and
especially
on
such
a
subject
as
a
masquerade
,
which
I
dislike
more
than
any
thing
I
ever
saw
.
<EOS>
I
could
say
a
great
deal
more
on
this
occasion
;
but
,
upon
my
word
,
I
am
quite
out
of
humour
with
it
:
for
I
liked
my
English
Mr.
B.
better
than
my
Spaniard
:
and
the
Nun
I
approved
not
by
any
means
;
though
there
were
some
who
observed
,
that
she
was
one
of
the
gracefullest
figures
in
the
place
.
<EOS>
And
,
indeed
,
in
spite
of
my
own
heart
,
I
could
not
help
thinking
so
too
.
  
<EOS>
Your
ladyship
knows
so
well
what
masquerades
are
,
that
I
may
well
be
excused
saying
any
thing
further
on
a
subject
<EOS>
I
am
so
little
pleased
with
:
for
you
only
desire
my
notions
of
those
diversions
,
because
I
am
a
novice
in
them
;
and
this
<EOS>
,
I
doubt
not
,
will
doubly
serve
to
answer
that
purpose
.
  
<EOS>
I
shall
only
therefore
add
,
that
after
an
hundred
other
impertinences
spoken
to
Miss
Darnford
and
me
,
and
retorted
with
spirit
by
her
,
and
as
well
as
I
could
by
myself
,
quite
sick
of
the
place
,
I
feigned
to
be
more
indisposed
than
I
was
,
and
so
got
my
beloved
Spaniard
to
go
off
with
us
,
and
reached
home
by
three
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
And
so
much
for
masquerades
.
<EOS>
I
hope
I
shall
never
have
occasion
to
mention
them
again
to
your
ladyship
.
<EOS>
I
am
,
my
dearest
Madam
,
your
ever
obliged
sister
and
servant
,
  
P.B.
    
MY
DEAREST
LADY
,
  
<EOS>
My
mind
is
so
wholly
engrossed
by
thoughts
of
a
very
different
nature
from
those
which
the
diversions
of
the
town
and
theatres
inspire
,
that
I
beg
to
be
excused
,
if
,
for
the
present
,
I
say
nothing
further
of
those
lighter
matters
.
<EOS>
But
as
you
do
not
disapprove
of
my
remarks
,
I
intend
,
if
God
spares
my
life
,
to
make
a
little
book
,
which
I
will
present
to
your
ladyship
,
of
my
poor
observations
on
all
the
dramatic
entertainments
I
have
seen
,
and
shall
see
,
this
winter
:
and
for
this
purpose
I
have
made
brief
notes
in
the
margin
of
the
printed
plays
I
have
bought
,
as
I
saw
them
,
with
a
pencil
;
by
referring
to
which
,
as
helps
to
my
memory
,
I
shall
be
able
to
state
what
my
thoughts
were
at
the
time
of
seeing
them
pretty
nearly
with
the
same
advantage
,
as
if
I
had
written
them
at
my
return
from
each
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
obtained
Sir
Simon
,
and
Lady
Darnford
's
permission
for
Miss
to
stay
with
me
till
it
shall
be
seen
how
it
will
please
God
to
deal
with
me
,
and
I
owe
this
favour
partly
to
a
kind
letter
written
in
my
behalf
to
Sir
Simon
,
by
Mr.
B.
,
and
partly
to
the
young
lady
's
earnest
request
to
her
papa
,
to
oblige
me
;
Sir
Simon
having
made
some
difficulty
to
comply
,
as
Mr.
Murray
and
his
bride
have
left
them
,
saying
,
he
could
not
live
long
,
if
he
had
not
the
company
of
his
beloved
daughter
.
  
<EOS>
But
what
shall
I
say
,
when
I
find
my
frailty
so
much
increased
,
that
I
can
not
,
with
the
same
intenseness
of
devotion
I
used
to
be
blest
with
,
apply
myself
to
the
throne
of
Grace
,
nor
,
of
consequence
,
find
my
invocations
answered
by
that
delight
and
inward
satisfaction
,
with
which
I
used
when
the
present
near
prospect
was
more
remote
?
  
<EOS>
I
hope
I
shall
not
be
deserted
in
the
hour
of
trial
,
and
that
this
my
weakness
of
mind
will
not
be
punished
with
a
spiritual
dereliction
,
for
suffering
myself
to
be
too
much
attached
to
those
worldly
delights
and
pleasures
,
which
no
mortal
ever
enjoyed
in
a
more
exalted
degree
than
myself
.
<EOS>
And
I
beseech
you
,
my
dearest
lady
,
let
me
be
always
remembered
in
your
prayers
 
only
for
a
resignation
to
the
Divine
will
;
a
cheerful
resignation
!
<EOS>
I
presume
not
to
prescribe
to
his
gracious
Providence
;
for
if
one
has
but
that
,
one
has
every
thing
that
one
need
to
have
.
  
<EOS>
Forgive
me
,
my
dearest
lady
,
for
being
so
deeply
serious
.
<EOS>
I
have
just
been
contending
with
a
severe
pang
,
that
is
now
gone
off
;
what
effect
its
return
may
have
,
God
only
knows
.
<EOS>
And
if
this
is
the
last
line
I
shall
ever
write
,
it
will
be
the
more
satisfactory
to
me
,
as
(
with
my
humble
respects
to
my
good
Lord
Davers
,
and
my
dear
countess
,
and
praying
for
the
continuance
of
all
your
healths
and
happiness
,
both
here
and
hereafter
)
,
I
am
permitted
to
subscribe
myself
your
ladyship
's
obliged
sister
and
humble
servant
,
  
P.B.
    
From
Lady
Davers
to
Mr.
B.
  
MY
DEAREST
BROTHER
,
  
<EOS>
Although
I
believe
it
needless
to
put
a
man
of
your
generous
spirit
in
mind
of
doing
a
worthy
action
;
yet
,
as
I
do
not
know
whether
you
have
thought
of
what
I
am
going
to
hint
to
you
,
I
can
not
forbear
a
line
or
two
with
regard
to
the
good
old
couple
in
Kent
.
  
<EOS>
I
am
sure
,
if
,
for
our
sins
,
God
Almighty
should
take
from
us
my
incomparable
sister
(
forgive
me
,
my
dear
brother
,
but
to
intimate
what
may
be
,
although
I
hourly
pray
,
as
her
trying
minute
approaches
,
that
it
will
not
)
,
you
will
,
for
her
sake
,
take
care
that
her
honest
parents
have
not
the
loss
of
your
favour
,
to
deepen
the
inconsolable
one
,
they
will
have
,
in
such
a
case
,
of
the
best
of
daughters
.
  
<EOS>
I
say
,
I
am
sure
you
will
do
as
generously
by
them
as
ever
:
<EOS>
and
I
dare
say
your
sweet
Pamela
doubts
it
not
:
yet
,
as
you
know
how
sensible
she
is
of
every
favour
<EOS>
done
them
,
it
is
the
countess
's
opinion
and
mine
,
and
Lady
Betty
's
too
,
that
you
give
her
this
assurance
,
in
some
legal
way
:
for
,
as
she
is
naturally
apprehensive
,
and
thinks
more
of
her
present
circumstances
,
than
,
for
your
sake
,
she
chooses
to
express
to
you
,
it
will
be
like
a
cordial
to
her
dutiful
and
grateful
heart
;
and
I
do
not
know
,
if
it
will
not
contribute
,
more
than
any
one
thing
,
to
make
her
go
through
her
task
with
ease
and
safety
.
  
<EOS>
I
know
how
much
your
heart
is
wrapped
up
in
the
dear
creature
:
and
you
are
a
worthy
brother
to
let
it
be
so
!
<EOS>
You
will
excuse
me
therefore
,
I
am
sure
,
for
this
my
officiousness
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
no
doubt
<EOS>
but
God
will
spare
her
to
us
,
because
,
although
we
may
not
be
worthy
of
such
excellence
,
yet
we
all
now
unite
so
gratefully
to
thank
him
,
for
such
a
worthy
relation
,
that
I
hope
we
shall
not
be
deprived
of
an
example
so
necessary
to
us
all
.
  
<EOS>
I
can
have
but
one
fear
,
and
that
is
,
that
,
young
as
she
is
,
she
seems
ripened
for
glory
:
she
seems
to
have
lived
long
enough
for
herself
.
<EOS>
But
for
you
,
and
for
us
,
that
God
will
still
spare
her
,
shall
be
the
hourly
prayer
of
,
my
dear
worthy
brother
,
your
ever
affectionate
sister
,
  
B.
DAVERS
.
  
<EOS>
Have
you
got
her
mother
with
you
?
<EOS>
I
hope
you
have
.
<EOS>
God
give
you
a
son
and
heir
,
if
it
be
his
blessed
will
!
<EOS>
But
,
however
that
be
,
preserve
your
Pamela
to
you
!
<EOS>
for
you
never
can
have
such
another
wife
.
    
<EOS>
From
Mrs.
B.
to
Mr.
B.
  
MY
DEAR
AND
EVER
-
HONOURED
MR
.
<EOS>
B.
,
  
<EOS>
Since
I
know
not
how
it
may
please
God
Almighty
to
dispose
of
me
on
the
approaching
occasion
,
I
should
think
myself
inexcusable
,
not
to
find
one
or
two
select
hours
to
dedicate
to
you
,
out
of
the
very
many
,
in
the
writing
way
,
which
your
goodness
has
indulged
me
,
because
you
saw
I
took
delight
in
it
.
  
<EOS>
But
yet
,
think
not
,
O
best
beloved
of
my
heart
!
<EOS>
that
I
have
any
boon
to
beg
,
any
favour
to
ask
,
either
for
myself
or
for
my
friends
,
or
so
much
as
the
continuance
of
your
favour
,
to
the
one
or
the
other
.
<EOS>
As
to
them
,
you
have
prevented
and
exceeded
all
my
wishes
:
<EOS>
as
to
myself
,
if
it
please
God
to
spare
me
,
I
know
I
shall
always
be
rewarded
beyond
my
desert
,
let
my
deservings
be
what
they
will
.
<EOS>
I
have
only
therefore
to
acknowledge
with
the
deepest
sense
of
your
goodness
to
me
,
and
with
the
most
heart
-
affecting
gratitude
,
that
from
the
happy
,
the
thrice
happy
hour
,
that
you
so
generously
made
me
yours
,
till
this
moment
,
you
have
not
left
one
thing
,
on
my
own
part
,
to
wish
for
,
but
the
continuance
and
increase
of
your
felicity
,
and
that
I
might
be
still
worthier
of
the
unexampled
goodness
,
tenderness
,
and
condescension
,
wherewith
you
have
always
treated
me
.
  
<EOS>
No
,
my
dearest
,
my
best
beloved
master
,
friend
,
husband
,
my
first
,
my
last
,
and
only
love
!
<EOS>
believe
me
,
I
have
nothing
to
wish
for
but
your
honour
and
felicity
,
temporal
and
eternal
;
and
I
make
no
doubt
,
that
God
,
in
his
infinite
goodness
and
mercy
,
will
perfect
his
own
good
work
,
begun
in
your
dear
heart
;
and
,
whatever
may
now
happen
,
give
us
a
happy
meeting
,
never
more
to
part
from
one
another
.
  
<EOS>
Let
me
then
beg
of
you
,
my
dearest
protector
,
to
pardon
all
my
imperfections
and
defects
;
and
if
,
ever
since
I
have
had
the
honour
to
be
yours
,
I
have
in
looks
,
or
in
word
,
or
in
deed
,
given
you
cause
to
wish
me
other
than
I
was
,
that
you
will
kindly
put
it
to
the
score
of
natural
infirmity
(
for
in
thought
or
intention
<EOS>
,
I
can
truly
boast
,
I
have
never
wilfully
erred
)
.
<EOS>
Your
tenderness
,
and
generous
politeness
to
me
,
always
gave
me
apprehension
,
that
I
was
not
what
you
wished
me
to
be
,
because
you
would
not
find
fault
with
me
so
often
as
I
fear
I
deserved
:
and
this
makes
me
beg
of
you
to
do
,
as
I
hope
God
Almighty
will
,
pardon
all
my
involuntary
errors
and
omissions
.
  
<EOS>
But
let
me
say
one
word
for
my
dear
worthy
Mrs.
Jervis
.
<EOS>
Her
care
and
fidelity
will
be
very
necessary
for
your
affairs
,
dear
Sir
,
while
you
remain
single
,
which
I
hope
will
not
be
long
.
<EOS>
But
,
whenever
you
make
a
second
choice
,
be
pleased
to
allow
her
such
an
annuity
as
may
make
her
independent
,
and
pass
away
the
remainder
of
her
life
with
ease
and
comfort
.
<EOS>
And
this
I
the
rather
presume
to
request
,
as
my
late
honoured
lady
once
intimated
the
same
thing
to
you
.
<EOS>
If
I
were
to
name
what
that
may
be
,
it
would
not
be
with
the
thought
of
heightening
,
but
of
limiting
rather
,
the
natural
bounty
of
your
heart
;
and
fifty
pounds
a
-
year
would
be
a
rich
provision
,
in
her
opinion
,
and
will
entail
upon
you
,
dear
Sir
,
the
blessings
of
one
of
the
faithfullest
and
worthiest
hearts
in
the
kingdom
.
  
<EOS>
Nor
will
Christian
charity
permit
me
to
forget
the
once
wicked
,
but
now
penitent
Jewkes
.
<EOS>
I
understand
by
Miss
Darnford
,
that
she
begs
for
nothing
but
to
have
the
pleasure
of
dying
in
your
service
,
and
by
that
means
to
atone
for
some
small
slips
and
mistakes
in
her
accounts
,
which
she
had
made
formerly
,
and
she
accuses
herself
;
for
she
will
have
it
,
that
Mr.
Longman
has
been
better
to
her
than
she
deserved
,
in
passing
one
account
particularly
,
to
which
he
had
,
with
too
much
reason
,
objected
;
<EOS>
do
,
dear
Sir
,
if
your
future
happy
lady
has
no
great
dislike
to
the
poor
woman
,
be
pleased
to
grant
her
request
,
except
her
own
mind
should
alter
,
and
she
desire
her
dismission
.
  
<EOS>
And
now
I
have
to
beg
of
God
to
shower
down
his
most
precious
blessings
upon
you
,
my
dearest
,
my
first
,
my
last
,
and
my
only
love
!
<EOS>
and
to
return
to
you
an
hundred
fold
,
the
benefits
which
you
have
conferred
upon
me
and
mine
,
and
upon
so
many
poor
souls
,
as
you
have
blessed
through
my
hands
!
<EOS>
And
that
you
may
in
your
next
choice
be
happy
with
a
lady
,
who
may
have
every
thing
I
want
;
and
who
may
love
and
honour
you
,
with
the
same
affectionate
duty
,
which
has
been
my
delight
and
my
glory
to
pay
you
:
for
in
this
I
am
sure
,
no
one
can
exceed
me
!
 
<EOS>
And
after
having
given
you
long
life
,
prosperity
,
and
increase
of
honour
,
translate
you
into
a
blessed
eternity
,
where
,
through
the
merits
of
our
common
Redeemer
,
I
hope
I
shall
be
allowed
a
place
,
and
be
permitted
(
O
let
me
indulge
that
pleasing
,
that
consolatory
thought
!
)
to
receive
and
rejoice
in
my
restored
spouse
,
for
ever
and
ever
:
are
the
prayers
,
the
last
prayers
,
if
it
so
please
God
!
<EOS>
of
,
my
dearest
dear
Mr.
B.
,
your
dutiful
and
affectionate
wife
,
and
faithful
servant
,
  
<EOS>
P.B.
    
From
Miss
Darnford
to
Lady
Darnford
.
  
<EOS>
MY
HONOURED
MAMMA
,
  
You
can
not
conceive
how
you
and
my
dear
papa
have
delighted
my
good
Mrs.
B.
and
obliged
her
Mr.
B.
by
the
permission
you
have
given
me
to
attend
her
till
the
important
hour
shall
be
over
with
her
;
for
she
is
exceedingly
apprehensive
,
and
one
can
hardly
blame
her
;
since
there
is
hardly
such
another
happy
couple
in
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
I
am
glad
to
hear
that
the
ceremony
is
over
,
so
much
to
both
your
satisfactions
:
may
this
matrimony
be
but
a
tenth
part
as
happy
as
that
I
am
witness
to
here
;
and
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Murray
will
have
that
to
boast
of
,
which
few
married
people
have
,
even
among
those
we
call
happy
!
  
<EOS>
For
my
part
,
I
believe
I
shall
never
care
to
marry
at
all
;
for
though
I
can
not
be
so
deserving
as
Mrs.
B.
<EOS>
yet
I
shall
not
bear
to
think
of
a
husband
much
less
excellent
than
hers
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
by
what
I
see
in
her
apprehensions
,
and
conceive
of
the
condition
she
hourly
expects
to
be
in
,
I
do
n't
think
a
lady
can
be
requited
with
a
less
worthy
one
,
for
all
she
is
likely
to
suffer
on
a
husband
's
account
,
and
for
the
sake
of
his
family
and
name
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Andrews
,
a
discreet
worthy
soul
as
ever
<EOS>
I
knew
,
and
who
in
her
aspect
and
behaviour
is
far
from
being
a
disgrace
even
to
Mr.
B.
's
lady
,
is
with
her
dear
daughter
,
to
her
no
small
satisfaction
,
as
you
may
suppose
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
asked
my
advice
yesterday
,
about
having
in
the
house
a
midwife
,
to
be
at
hand
,
at
a
moment
's
warning
.
<EOS>
I
said
I
feared
the
sight
of
such
a
person
would
terrify
her
:
<EOS>
and
so
he
instantly
started
an
expedient
,
of
which
her
mother
,
Mrs.
Jervis
,
and
myself
,
approved
,
and
have
put
into
practice
;
for
this
day
,
Mrs.
Harris
,
a
distant
relation
of
mine
,
though
not
of
yours
,
Sir
and
Madam
,
is
arrived
from
Essex
to
make
me
a
visit
;
and
Mr.
B.
has
prevailed
upon
her
,
in
compliment
to
me
,
as
he
pretended
,
to
accept
of
her
board
in
his
house
,
while
she
stays
in
town
,
which
she
says
,
will
be
about
a
week
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Harris
being
a
discreet
,
modest
,
matron
-
like
person
,
Mrs.
B.
took
a
liking
to
her
at
first
sight
,
and
is
already
very
familiar
with
her
;
and
understanding
that
she
was
a
doctor
of
physic
's
lady
,
and
takes
as
much
delight
in
administering
to
the
health
of
her
own
sex
,
as
her
husband
used
to
do
to
that
of
both
,
Mrs.
B.
says
it
is
very
fortunate
,
that
she
has
so
experienced
a
lady
to
consult
,
as
she
is
such
a
novice
in
her
own
case
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
however
,
to
carry
on
the
honest
imposture
the
better
,
just
now
,
in
presence
of
Mrs.
Harris
,
and
Mrs.
Andrews
,
and
me
,
asked
the
former
,
if
it
was
not
necessary
to
have
in
the
house
the
good
woman
?
<EOS>
This
frighted
Mrs.
B.
who
turned
pale
,
and
said
she
could
not
bear
the
thoughts
of
it
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Harris
said
it
was
highly
necessary
that
Mrs.
B.
if
she
would
not
permit
the
gentlewoman
to
be
in
the
house
,
should
see
her
;
and
that
then
,
she
apprehended
,
there
would
be
no
necessity
,
as
she
did
not
live
far
off
,
to
have
her
in
the
house
,
since
Mrs.
B.
was
so
uneasy
upon
that
account
.
<EOS>
This
pleased
Mrs.
B.
much
,
and
Mrs.
Thomas
was
admitted
to
attend
her
.
  
<EOS>
Now
,
you
must
know
,
that
this
is
the
assistant
of
my
new
relation
;
and
she
being
apprised
of
the
matter
,
came
;
but
never
did
I
see
so
much
shyness
and
apprehension
as
Mrs.
B.
shewed
all
the
time
Mrs.
Thomas
was
with
her
,
holding
sometimes
her
mother
,
sometimes
Mrs.
Harris
,
by
the
hand
,
and
being
ready
to
sweat
with
terror
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Harris
scraped
acquaintance
with
Mrs.
Thomas
,
who
,
pretending
to
recollect
her
,
gave
Mrs.
Harris
great
praises
;
which
increased
Mrs.
B.
's
confidence
in
her
:
<EOS>
and
she
undertakes
to
govern
the
whole
so
,
that
the
dreaded
Mrs.
Thomas
need
not
come
till
the
very
moment
:
which
is
no
small
pleasure
to
the
over
-
nice
lady
.
<EOS>
And
she
seems
every
hour
to
be
better
pleased
with
Mrs.
Harris
,
who
,
by
her
prudent
talk
,
will
more
and
more
familiarize
her
to
the
circumstance
,
unawares
to
herself
in
a
manner
.
<EOS>
But
notwithstanding
this
precaution
,
of
a
midwife
in
the
house
,
Mr.
B.
intends
to
have
a
gentleman
of
the
profession
in
readiness
,
for
fear
of
the
worst
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
B.
has
written
a
letter
,
with
this
superscription
:
"
To
the
ever
-
honoured
and
ever
-
dear
Mr.
B.
,
with
prayers
for
his
health
,
honour
,
and
prosperity
in
this
world
,
and
everlasting
felicity
in
that
to
come
.
<EOS>
P.B.
<EOS>
"
It
is
sealed
with
black
wax
,
and
she
gave
it
me
this
moment
,
on
her
being
taken
ill
,
to
give
to
Mr.
B.
if
she
dies
.
<EOS>
But
God
,
of
his
mercy
,
avert
that
!
<EOS>
and
preserve
the
dear
lady
,
for
the
honour
of
her
sex
,
and
the
happiness
of
all
who
know
her
,
and
particularly
for
that
of
your
Polly
Darnford
;
for
I
can
not
have
a
greater
loss
,
I
am
sure
,
while
my
honoured
papa
and
mamma
are
living
:
and
may
that
be
for
many
,
very
many
,
happy
years
!
  
<EOS>
I
will
not
close
this
letter
till
all
is
over
:
happily
,
as
I
hope
!
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
B.
is
better
again
,
and
has
,
occasionally
,
made
some
fine
reflections
,
directing
herself
to
me
,
but
designed
for
the
benefit
of
her
Polly
,
on
the
subject
of
the
inconsideration
of
some
of
our
sex
,
with
regard
to
the
circumstances
she
is
in
.
  
<EOS>
I
knew
what
her
design
was
,
and
said
,
"
Aye
,
Polly
,
let
you
and
I
,
and
every
single
young
body
,
bear
these
reflections
in
mind
,
pronounced
by
so
excellent
a
lady
,
in
a
moment
so
arduous
as
these
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
girl
wept
,
and
very
movingly
fell
down
by
the
door
,
on
her
knees
,
praying
to
God
to
preserve
her
dear
lady
,
and
she
should
be
happy
for
ever
!
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
B.
is
exceedingly
pleased
with
my
new
relation
Mrs.
Harris
,
as
we
call
her
,
who
behaves
with
so
much
prudence
,
that
she
suspects
nothing
,
and
told
Mrs.
Jervis
,
she
wished
nobody
else
was
to
come
near
her
.
<EOS>
And
as
she
goes
out
(
being
a
person
of
eminence
in
her
way
)
two
or
three
times
a
day
,
and
last
night
staid
out
late
,
Mrs.
B.
said
,
she
hoped
she
would
not
be
abroad
,
when
she
should
wish
her
to
be
at
home
   
<EOS>
I
have
the
very
great
pleasure
,
my
dear
papa
and
mamma
,
to
acquaint
you
,
and
<EOS>
I
know
you
will
rejoice
with
me
upon
it
,
that
just
half
an
hour
ago
,
my
dear
Mrs.
B.
was
brought
to
-
bed
of
a
fine
boy
.
  
<EOS>
We
are
all
out
of
our
wits
for
joy
almost
.
<EOS>
I
ran
down
to
Mr.
B.
myself
,
who
received
me
with
trembling
impatience
.
"
<EOS>
A
boy
!
<EOS>
a
fine
boy
!
<EOS>
dear
Mr.
B.

"
said
I
:
"
a
son

heir

indeed
!
<EOS>

<EOS>

But
how
does
my
Pamela
?
<EOS>
Is
she
safe
?
<EOS>
Is
she
like
to
do
well
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>

We
hope
so
,
"
said
I
:
"
<EOS>
or
I
had
not
come
down
to
you
,
I
'll
assure
you
.
"
<EOS>
He
folded
me
in
his
arms
,
in
a
joyful
rapture
:
"
How
happy
you
make
me
,
dearest
Miss
Darnford
!
<EOS>
If
my
Pamela
is
safe
,
the
boy
is
welcome
,
welcome
,
indeed
!
 
<EOS>
But
when
may
I
go
up
to
thank
my
jewel
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Andrews
is
so
overjoyed
,
and
so
thankful
,
that
there
is
no
getting
her
from
her
knees
.
  
<EOS>
A
man
and
horse
is
dispatched
already
to
Lady
Davers
,
and
another
ordered
to
Kent
,
to
the
good
old
man
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jervis
,
when
I
went
up
,
said
she
must
go
down
and
release
the
good
folks
from
their
knees
;
for
,
half
an
hour
before
,
they
declared
they
would
not
stir
from
that
posture
till
they
heard
how
it
went
with
their
lady
;
and
when
the
happy
news
was
brought
them
of
her
safety
,
and
of
a
young
master
,
they
were
quite
ecstatic
,
she
says
,
in
their
joy
,
and
not
a
dry
eye
among
them
,
shaking
hands
,
and
congratulating
one
another
,
men
and
maids
;
which
made
it
one
of
the
most
affecting
sights
that
can
be
imagined
.
<EOS>
And
Mr.
Longman
,
who
had
no
power
to
leave
the
house
for
three
days
past
,
hasted
to
congratulate
his
worthy
principal
;
and
never
was
so
much
moving
joy
seen
,
as
this
honest
-
hearted
steward
ran
over
with
.
  
<EOS>
I
did
a
foolish
thing
in
my
joy
 
<EOS>
I
gave
Mr.
B.
the
letter
designed
for
him
,
had
an
unhappy
event
followed
;
and
he
wo
n't
return
it
:
but
says
,
he
will
obtain
Mrs.
B.
's
leave
,
when
she
is
better
,
to
open
it
;
and
the
happier
turn
will
augment
his
thankfulness
to
God
,
and
love
to
her
,
when
he
shall
,
by
this
means
,
be
blest
with
sentiments
so
different
from
what
the
other
case
would
have
afforded
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
B.
had
a
very
sharp
time
.
<EOS>
Never
more
,
my
dear
papa
,
talk
of
a
husband
to
me
.
<EOS>
Place
all
your
expectations
on
Nancy
!
<EOS>
Not
one
of
these
men
that
I
have
yet
seen
,
is
worth
running
these
risques
for
!
<EOS>
But
Mr.
B.
's
endearments
and
tenderness
to
his
lady
,
his
thankful
and
manly
gratitude
and
politeness

when
he
was
admitted
to
pay
his
respects
to
her
,
and
his
behaviour
to
Mrs.
Andrews
,
and
to
us
all
,
though
but
for
a
visit
of
ten
minutes
,
was
alone
worthy
of
all
her
risque

<EOS>
I
would
give
you
a
description
of
it

had
I
Mrs.
B.

pen

and
of
twenty
agreeable
scenes

conversations
besides

,
for

<EOS>
Mr.
B.
,
you
know
,
was
always
deemed
one
of
the
kindest
landlords
in
England
;
and
his
tenants
are
overjoyed
at
the
happy
event
which
has
given
them
a
young
landlord
of
his
name
:
for
all
those
who
live
in
that
large
part
of
the
estate
,
which
came
by
Mrs.
B.
his
mother
,
were
much
afraid
of
having
any
of
Sir
Jacob
Swynford
's
family
for
their
landlord
,
who
,
they
say
,
are
all
made
up
of
pride
and
cruelty
,
and
would
have
racked
them
to
death
:
<EOS>
insomuch
that
they
had
a
voluntary
meeting
of
about
twenty
of
the
principal
of
them
,
to
rejoice
on
the
occasion
;
and
it
was
unanimously
agreed
to
make
a
present
of
a
piece
of
gilt
plate
,
to
serve
as
basin
for
the
christening
,
to
the
value
of
one
hundred
guineas

on
which
is
to
be
engraven
the
following
inscription
:
  
"
In
acknowledgment
of
the
humanity
and
generosity
of
the
best

as
a
token

the
birth

a

who
will

hoped

inherit
his

generosity

and
his

this
piece
of
plate
is
,
with
all
due
gratitude
,
presented

as
a

Then

<EOS>
What
an
honour
is
this
to
a
landlord
!
<EOS>
In
my
opinion
very
far
surpassing
the
mis
-
nomer'd
free
gifts
which
we
read
of
in
some
kingdoms
on
extraordinary
occasions
,
some
of
them
like
this
!
<EOS>
For
here
it
is
all
truly
spontaneous
 
<EOS>
A
free
gift
indeed
!
<EOS>
and
Mr.
B.
took
it
very
kindly
,
and
has
put
off
the
christening
for
a
week
,
to
give
time
for
its
being
completed
and
inscribed
as
above

The
Earl
and
Countess
of
C.
and
Lord
and
Lady
Davers
,
are
here
,
to
stand
in
person
at
the
christening

and
you
can
not
conceive
how
greatly
my
Lady
Davers
is
transported
with
joy
,
to
have
a
son
and
heir
to
the
estate
<EOS>
:
she
is
every
hour
,
almost
,
thanking
her
dear
sister
for
him
;
and
reads
in
the
child
all
the
great
qualities
she
forms
to
herself
in
him
.
'
<EOS>
Tis
indeed
a
charming
boy
,
and
has
a
great
deal
(
if
one
may
judge
of
a
child
so
very
young
)
of
his
father
's
manly
aspect
.
<EOS>
The
dear
lady
herself
is
still
but
weak
;
but
the
joy
of
all
around
her
,
and
her
spouse
's
tenderness
and
politeness
,
give
her
cheerful
and
free
spirits
;
and
she
is
all
serenity
,
ease
,
and
thankfulness

<EOS>
Mrs.
B.
,
as
soon
as
the
danger
was
over
,
asked
me
for
her
letter
with
the
black
seal
.
<EOS>
I
had
been
very
earnest
to
get
it
from
Mr.
B.
but
to
no
purpose
;
so
I
was
forced
to
tell
who
had
it
.
<EOS>
She
said
,
but
very
composedly
,
she
was
sorry
for
it
,
and
hoped
he
had
not
opened
it
.
  
<EOS>
He
came
into
her
chamber
soon
after
,
and
I
demanded
it
before
her
.
<EOS>
He
said
he
had
designed
to
ask
her
leave
to
break
the
seal
,
which
he
had
not
yet
done
;
nor
would
without
her
consent
.
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
give
me
leave
,
my
dear
,
"
said
he
,
"
to
break
the
seal
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
If
you
do
,
Sir
,
let
it
not
be
in
my
presence
;
but
it
is
too
serious
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Not
,
my
dear
,
now
the
apprehension
is
so
happily
over
:
it
may
now
add
to
my
joy
and
my
thankfulness
on
that
account
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
,
do
as
you
please
,
Sir
;
but
I
had
rather
you
would
not
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
here
it
is
,
Miss
Darnford
:
it
was
put
into
your
hands
,
and
there
I
place
it
again
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
something
like
,
"
said
I
,
"
considering
the
gentleman
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
B.
,
I
hope
we
shall
bring
him
into
good
order
between
us
in
time
.
"
<EOS>
So
I
returned
it
to
the
dear
writer
;
who
put
it
into
her
bosom
.
  
<EOS>
I
related
to
Lady
Davers
,
when
she
came
,
this
circumstance
;
and
she
<EOS>
,
I
believe
,
has
leave
to
take
it
with
her
.
<EOS>
She
is
very
proud
of
all
opportunities
now
of
justifying
her
brother
's
choice
,
and
doing
honour
to
his
wife
,
with
Lady
Betty
C.
,
who
is
her
great
favourite
,
and
who
delights
to
read
Mrs.
B.
's
letters
.
  
<EOS>
You
desire
to
know
,
my
honoured
papa
,
how
Mr.
B.
passes
his
time
,
and
whether
it
be
in
his
lady
's
chamber
?
<EOS>
No
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
Catch
gentlemen
,
the
best
of
them
,
in
too
great
a
complaisance
that
way
,
if
you
can
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
then
,
does
he
pass
his
time
with
you
,
Polly
?
<EOS>
"
you
are
pleased
to
ask
.
<EOS>
What
a
disadvantage
a
man
lies
under
,
who
has
been
once
a
rake
!
<EOS>
But
I
am
so
generally
with
Mrs.
B.
that
when
I
tell
you
,
Sir
,
his
visits
to
her
are
much
of
the
polite
form
<EOS>
,
I
believe
I
answer
all
you
mean
by
your
questions
;
and
especially
when
I
remind
you
,
Sir
,
that
Lord
and
Lady
Davers
,
and
the
Earl
and
Countess
of
C.
and
your
unworthy
daughter
,
are
at
dinner
and
supper
-
time
generally
together
;
for
Mrs.
Andrews
,
who
is
not
yet
gone
back
to
Kent
,
breakfasts
,
dines
,
and
sups
with
her
beloved
daughter
,
and
is
hardly
ever
out
of
her
room
.
  
<EOS>
Then
,
Sir
,
Mr.
B.
,
the
Earl
,
and
Lord
Davers
,
give
pretty
constant
attendance
to
the
business
of
parliament
;
and
,
now
and
-
then
,
sup
abroad
 
<EOS>
So
,
Sir
,
we
are
all
upon
honour
;
and
I
could
wish
(
only
that
your
facetiousness
always
gives
me
pleasure
,
as
it
is
a
token
that
you
have
your
much
-
desired
health
and
freedom
of
spirits
)
,
that
even
in
jest
,
my
mamma
's
daughter
might
pass
unquestioned
.
  
<EOS>
But
I
know
why
you
do
it
:
it
is
only
to
put
me
out
of
heart
to
ask
to
stay
longer
.
<EOS>
Yet
I
wish
 
<EOS>
But
I
know
you
wo
n't
permit
me
to
go
through
the
whole
winter
here
.
<EOS>
Will
my
dear
papa
grant
it
,
do
you
think
,
if
you
were
to
lay
the
highest
obligation
upon
your
dutiful
daughter
,
and
petition
for
me
?
<EOS>
And
should
you
care
to
try
?
<EOS>
I
dare
not
hope
it
myself
:
but
when
one
sees
a
gentleman
here
,
who
denies
his
lady
nothing
,
it
makes
one
wish
,
methinks
,
that
Lady
Darnford
,
was
as
happy
in
that
particular
as
Mrs.
B.
  
Your
indulgence
for
this
one
winter
,
or
,
<EOS>
rather
this
small
remainder
of
it
<EOS>
,
I
make
not
so
much
doubt
of
<EOS>
,
you
see
,
Madam
.
<EOS>
I
know
you
'll
call
me
a
bold
girl
;
but
then
you
always
,
when
you
do
,
condescend
to
grant
my
request
:
and
I
will
be
as
good
as
ever
<EOS>
I
can
be
afterwards
.
<EOS>
I
will
fetch
up
all
the
lost
time
;
rise
an
hour
sooner
in
the
morning
,
go
to
bed
an
hour
later
at
night
;
flower
<EOS>
my
papa
any
thing
he
pleases
<EOS>
;
read
him
to
sleep
when
he
pleases
;
put
his
gout
into
good
-
humour
,
when
it
will
be
soothed
 
And
Mrs.
B.
,
to
crown
all
,
will
come
down
with
me
,
by
permission
of
her
sovereign
lord
,
who
will
attend
her
,
you
may
be
sure
:
and
will
not
all
this
do
,
to
procure
me
a
month
or
two
more
?
 
<EOS>
If
it
wo
n't
,
why
then
,
I
will
thank
you
for
your
past
goodness
to
me
,
and
with
all
duty
and
cheerfulness
,
bid
adieu
to
this
dear
London
,
this
dearer
family
,
and
tend
a
still
dearer
papa
and
mamma
;
whose
dutiful
daughter
I
will
ever
be
,
whilst
  
POLLY
DARNFORD
.
    
<EOS>
To
the
Same
.
  
<EOS>
MY
HONOURED
PAPA
AND
MAMMA
,
  
<EOS>
I
have
received
your
joint
commands
,
and
intend
to
set
out
on
Wednesday
,
next
week
.
<EOS>
I
hope
to
find
my
papa
in
better
health
than
at
present
,
and
in
better
humour
too
;
for
I
am
sorry
he
is
displeased
with
my
petitioning
for
a
little
longer
time
in
London
.
<EOS>
It
is
very
severe
to
impute
to
me
want
of
duty
and
affection
,
which
would
,
if
deserved
,
make
me
most
unworthy
of
your
favour
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
and
his
lady
are
resolved
to
accompany
me
in
their
coach
,
till
your
chariot
meets
me
,
if
you
will
be
pleased
to
permit
it
so
to
do
;
and
even
set
me
down
at
your
gate
,
if
it
did
not
;
but
he
vows
,
that
he
will
neither
alight
at
your
house
,
nor
let
his
lady
.
<EOS>
But
I
say
,
that
this
is
a
misplaced
resentment
,
because
I
ought
to
think
it
a
favour
,
that
you
have
indulged
me
so
much
as
you
have
done
.
<EOS>
And
yet
even
this
is
likewise
a
favour
on
their
side
,
to
me
,
because
it
is
an
instance
of
their
fondness
for
your
unworthy
daughter
's
company
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
B.
is
,
if
possible
,
more
lovely
since
her
lying
-
in
than
before
.
<EOS>
She
has
so
much
delight
in
her
nursery
,
that
I
fear
it
will
take
her
off
from
her
pen
,
which
will
be
a
great
loss
to
all
whom
she
used
to
oblige
with
her
correspondence
.
<EOS>
Indeed
this
new
object
of
her
care
is
a
charming
child
;
and
she
is
exceedingly
pleased
with
her
nurse
;
 
for
she
is
not
permitted
,
as
she
very
much
desired
,
to
suckle
it
herself
.
  
<EOS>
She
makes
a
great
proficiency
in
the
French
and
Italian
languages
;
and
well
she
may
;
for
she
has
the
best
schoolmaster
in
the
world
,
and
one
whom
she
loves
better
than
any
lady
ever
loved
a
tutor
.
<EOS>
He
is
lofty
,
and
will
not
be
disputed
with
;
but
I
never
saw
a
more
polite
and
tender
husband
,
for
all
that
.
  
<EOS>
We
had
a
splendid
christening
,
exceedingly
well
ordered
,
and
every
body
was
delighted
at
it
.
<EOS>
The
quality
gossips
went
away
but
on
Tuesday
;
and
my
Lady
Davers
took
leave
of
her
charming
sister
with
all
the
blessings
,
and
all
the
kindness
,
and
affectionate
fondness
,
that
could
be
expressed
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Andrews
,
that
worthy
old
man
,
came
up
to
see
his
grandson
,
yesterday
.
<EOS>
You
would
never
have
forgotten
the
good
man
's
behaviour
(
had
you
seen
it
)
,
to
his
daughter
,
and
to
the
charming
child
;
I
wish
I
could
describe
it
to
you
;
but
I
am
apt
to
think
Mrs.
B.
will
notice
it
to
Lady
Davers
;
and
if
she
enters
into
the
description
of
it
while
I
stay
,
I
will
beg
a
copy
of
it
,
to
bring
down
with
me
;
because
I
know
you
were
pleased
with
the
sensible
,
plain
,
good
man
,
and
his
ways
,
when
at
the
Hall
in
your
neighbourhood
.
  
<EOS>
The
child
is
named
William
,
and
I
should
have
told
you
;
but
I
write
without
any
manner
of
connection
,
just
as
things
come
uppermost
:
but
do
n't
,
my
dear
papa
,
construe
this
,
too
,
as
an
instance
of
disrespect
.
  
<EOS>
I
see
but
one
thing
that
can
possibly
happen
to
disturb
the
felicity
of
this
charming
couple
;
and
that
I
will
mention
,
in
confidence
.
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
and
Mrs.
B.
and
myself
were
at
the
masquerade
,
before
she
lay
-
in
:
there
was
a
lady
greatly
taken
with
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
She
was
in
a
nun
's
habit
,
and
followed
him
wherever
he
went
;
and
Mr.
Turner
,
a
gentleman
of
one
of
the
inns
of
court
,
who
visits
Mr.
B.
and
is
an
old
acquaintance
of
his
,
tells
me
,
by
-
the
bye
,
that
the
lady
took
an
opportunity
to
unmask
to
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
Mr.
Turner
has
since
found
she
is
the
young
Countess
Dowager
of
 
,
a
fine
lady
;
but
not
the
most
reserved
in
her
conduct
of
late
,
since
her
widowhood
.
<EOS>
And
he
has
since
discovered
,
as
he
says
,
that
a
letter
or
two
,
if
not
more
,
have
passed
between
Mr.
B.
and
that
lady
.
  
<EOS>
Now
Mrs.
B.
,
with
all
her
perfections
,
has
,
as
she
owns
,
a
little
spice
of
jealousy
;
and
should
she
be
once
alarmed
,
I
tremble
for
the
consequence
to
both
their
happiness
.
  
<EOS>
I
conceive
,
that
if
ever
anything
makes
a
misunderstanding
between
them
,
it
will
be
from
some
such
quarter
as
this
.
<EOS>
But
'
tis
a
thousand
pities
it
should
.
<EOS>
And
I
hope
,
as
to
the
actual
correspondence
begun
,
Mr.
Turner
is
mistaken
.
  
<EOS>
But
be
it
as
it
will
,
I
would
not
for
the
world
,
that
the
first
hints
of
this
matter
should
come
from
me
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
is
a
very
enterprising
and
gallant
man
,
a
fine
figure
,
and
I
do
n't
wonder
a
lady
may
like
him
.
<EOS>
But
he
seems
so
pleased
,
so
satisfied
with
his
wife
,
and
carries
it
to
her
with
so
much
tenderness
and
affection
,
that
I
hope
her
merit
,
and
his
affection
for
her
,
will
secure
his
conjugal
fidelity
.
  
<EOS>
If
it
prove
otherwise
,
and
she
discovers
it
,
I
know
not
one
that
would
be
more
miserable
than
Mrs.
B.
,
as
well
from
motives
of
piety
and
virtue
,
as
from
the
excessive
love
she
bears
him
.
<EOS>
But
I
hope
for
better
things
,
for
both
their
sakes
.
  
<EOS>
My
humble
thanks
for
all
your
indulgence
to
me
,
with
hopes
,
that
you
will
not
,
my
dear
papa
and
mamma
,
hold
your
displeasure
against
me
,
when
I
throw
myself
at
your
feet
,
as
I
now
soon
hope
to
do
.
<EOS>
Conclude
me
your
dutiful
daughter
,
  
P.
DARNFORD
.
    
<EOS>
From
Mrs.
B.
to
Lady
Davers
.
  
<EOS>
MY
DEAR
LADY
,
  
<EOS>
We
are
just
returned
from
accompanying
the
worthy
Miss
Darnford
as
far
as
Bedford
,
in
her
way
home
,
where
her
papa
and
mamma
met
her
in
their
coach
.
<EOS>
Sir
Simon
put
on
his
pleasant
airs
,
and
schooled
Mr.
B.
for
persuading
his
daughter
to
stay
so
long
from
him
;
me
for
putting
her
upon
asking
to
stay
longer
;
and
she
for
being
persuaded
by
us
.
  
<EOS>
We
tarried
two
days
together
at
Bedford
;
for
we
knew
not
how
to
part
;
and
then
we
took
a
most
affectionate
leave
of
each
other
.
  
<EOS>
We
struck
out
of
the
road
a
little
,
to
make
a
visit
to
the
dear
house
,
where
we
tarried
one
night
;
and
next
morning
before
any
body
could
come
to
congratulate
us
(
designing
to
be
incog
.
)
<EOS>
,
we
proceeded
on
our
journey
to
London
,
and
found
my
dearest
,
dear
boy
,
in
charming
health
.
  
<EOS>
What
a
new
pleasure
has
God
bestowed
upon
me
;
which
,
after
every
little
absence
,
rises
upon
me
in
a
true
maternal
tenderness
,
every
step
I
move
toward
the
dear
little
blessing
!
<EOS>
Yet
sometimes
,
I
think
your
dear
brother
is
not
so
fond
of
him
as
I
wish
him
to
be
.
<EOS>
He
says
,
"
'
tis
time
enough
for
him
to
mind
him
,
when
he
can
return
his
notice
,
and
be
grateful
!
"
 
<EOS>
A
negligent
word
is
n't
it
,
Madam
 
<EOS>
considering
   
<EOS>
My
dear
father
came
to
town
,
to
accompany
my
good
mother
down
to
Kent
,
and
they
set
out
soon
after
your
ladyship
left
us
.
<EOS>
It
is
impossible
to
describe
the
joy
with
which
his
worthy
heart
overflowed
,
when
he
congratulated
us
on
the
happy
event
.
<EOS>
And
as
he
had
been
apprehensive
for
his
daughter
's
safety
,
judge
,
my
lady
,
what
his
transports
must
be
,
to
see
us
all
safe
and
well
,
and
happy
,
and
a
son
given
to
Mr.
B.
by
his
greatly
honoured
daughter
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
in
the
nursery
when
he
came
.
<EOS>
So
was
my
mother
.
<EOS>
Miss
Darnford
also
was
there
.
<EOS>
And
Mr.
B.
,
who
was
in
his
closet
,
at
his
arrival
,
after
having
received
his
most
respectful
congratulations
himself
,
brought
him
up
(
though
he
has
not
been
there
since
:
indeed
he
ha'n't
!
)
<EOS>
"
Pamela
,
"
said
the
dear
gentleman
,
"
see
who
's
here
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
sprang
to
him
,
and
kneeled
for
his
blessing
:
"
O
my
father
!
"
<EOS>
said
I
,
"
see
"
(
<EOS>
pointing
to
the
dear
baby
at
the
nurse
's
breast
)
,
"
how
God
Almighty
has
answered
all
our
prayers
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
dropped
down
on
his
knees
by
me
,
clasping
me
in
his
indulgent

O
my

<EOS>
My
blessed
daughter

<EOS>
And
do
I
once
more
see
you
!
<EOS>
And
see
you
safe

I

Blessed

"
  
<EOS>
While
we
were
thus
joined
,
happy
father
,
and
happy
daughter
,
in
one
thanksgiving
,
the
sweet
baby
having
fallen
asleep
,
the
nurse
had
put
it
into
the
cradle
;
and
when
my
father
rose
from
me
,
he
went
to
my
mother
,
"
God
bless
my
dear
Betty
,
"
<EOS>
said
he
,
"
I
longed
to
see
you
,
after
this
separation
.
<EOS>
Here
's
joy
!
<EOS>
here
's
pleasure
!
<EOS>
O
how
happy
are
we
!
"
<EOS>
And
taking
her
hand
,
he
kneeled
down
on
one
side
the
cradle
,
and
my
mother
on
the
other
,
both
looking
at
the
dear
baby
,
with
eyes
running
over
;
and
,
hand
in
hand
,
he
prayed
,
in
the
most
fervent
manner
,
for
a
blessing
upon
the
dear
infant
,
and
that
God
Almighty
would
make
him
an
honour
to
his
father
's
family
,
and
to
his
mother
's
virtue
;
and
that
,
in
the
words
of
Scripture
,
"
he
might
grow
on
,
and
be
in
favour
both
with
the
Lord
,
and
with
man
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
has
just
put
into
my
hands
Mr.
Locke
's
Treatise
on
Education
,
and
he
commands
me
to
give
him
my
thoughts
upon
it
in
writing
.
<EOS>
He
has
a
very
high
regard
for
this
author
,
and
tells
me
,
that
my
tenderness
for
Billy
will
make
me
think
some
of
the
first
advice
given
in
it
a
little
harsh
;
but
although
he
has
not
read
it
through
,
only
having
dipped
into
it
here
and
there
,
he
believes
from
the
name
of
the
author
,
I
can
not
have
a
better
directory
;
and
my
opinion
of
it
,
after
I
have
well
considered
it
,
will
inform
him
,
he
says
,
of
my
own
capacity
and
prudence
,
and
how
far
he
may
rely
upon
both
in
the
point
of
a
first
education
.
  
<EOS>
I
asked
,
if
I
might
not
be
excused
writing
,
only
making
my
observations
,
here
and
there
,
to
himself
,
as
I
found
occasion
?
<EOS>
But
he
said
,
"
You
will
yourself
,
my
dear
,
better
consider
the
subject
,
and
be
more
a
mistress
of
it
,
and
I
shall
the
better
attend
to
your
reasonings
,
when
put
into
writing
:
and
surely
,
Pamela
,
you
may
,
in
such
an
important
point
as
this
,
as
well
oblige
me
with
a
little
of
your
penmanship
,
as
your
other
dear
friends
.
"
  
<EOS>
After
this
,
your
ladyship
will
judge
I
had
not
another
word
to
say
.
<EOS>
He
cuts
one
to
the
heart
,
when
he
speaks
so
seriously
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
looked
a
little
into
it
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
book
quite
accommodated
to
my
case
,
being
written
to
a
gentleman
,
the
author
's
friend
,
for
the
regulation
of
his
conduct
towards
his
children
.
<EOS>
But
how
shall
I
do
,
if
in
such
a
famed
and
renowned
author
,
I
see
already
some
few
things
,
which
I
think
want
clearing
up
.
<EOS>
Wo
n't
it
look
like
intolerable
vanity
in
me
,
to
find
fault
with
such
a
genius
as
Mr.
Locke
?
  
<EOS>
I
must
,
on
this
occasion
,
give
your
ladyship
the
particulars
of
a
short
conversation
between
your
brother
and
me
;
which
,
however
,
perhaps
,
will
not
be
to
my
advantage
,
because
it
will
shew
you
what
a
teazing
body
I
can
be
,
if
I
am
indulged
.
<EOS>
But
Mr.
B.
will
not
spoil
me
neither
in
that
way
,
I
dare
say
!
 
<EOS>
Your
ladyship
will
see
this
in
the
very
dialogue
I
shall
give
you
.
  
<EOS>
Thus
it
was
.
<EOS>
I
had
been
reading
in
Mr.
Locke
's
book
,
and
Mr.
B.
asked
me
how
I
liked
it
?
 
<EOS>
"
Exceedingly
well
,
Sir
.
<EOS>
But
I
have
a
proposal
to
make
,
which
,
if
you
will
be
pleased
to
comply
with
,
will
give
me
a
charming
opportunity
of
understanding
Mr.
Locke
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
your
proposal
,
my
dear
?
<EOS>
I
see
it
is
some
very
particular
one
,
by
that
sweet
earnestness
in
your
look
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
so
it
is
,
Sir
:
and
I
must
know
,
whether
you
are
in
high
good
humour
,
before
I
make
it
.
<EOS>
I
think
you
look
grave
upon
me
;
and
my
proposal
will
not
then
do
,
I
'm
sure
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
all
the
amusing
ways
of
your
sex
,
my
dear
Pamela
.
<EOS>
But
tell
me
what
you
would
say
?
<EOS>
You
know
I
do
n't
love
suspense
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
May
-
be
you
're
busy
.
<EOS>
Sir
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
I
break
in
upon
you
.
<EOS>
I
believe
you
were
going
into
your
closet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
True
woman
!
 
<EOS>
How
you
love
to
put
one
upon
the
tenters
!
<EOS>
Yet
,
my
life
for
yours
,
by
your
parade
,
what
I
just
now
thought
important
,
is
some
pretty
trifle
!
 
<EOS>
Speak
it
at
once
,
or
I
'll
be
angry
with
you
;
"
and
tapped
my
cheek
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
wish
I
had
not
come
just
now
!
 
<EOS>
I
see
you
are
not
in
a
good
humour
enough
for
my
proposal
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
pray
,
Sir
,
excuse
me
till
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
took
my
hand
,
and
led
me
to
his
closet
,
calling
me
his
pretty
impertinent
;
and
then
urging
me
,
I
said
,
"
You
know
,
Sir
,
I
have
not
been
used
to
the
company
of
children
.
<EOS>
Your
dear
Billy
will
not
make
me
fit
,
for
a
long
time
,
to
judge
of
any
part
of
education
.
<EOS>
I
can
learn
of
the
charming
boy
nothing
but
the
baby
conduct
:
but
now
,
if
I
might
take
into
the
house
some
little
Master
of
three
or
four
years
old
,
or
Miss
of
five
or
six
,
I
should
watch
over
all
their
little
ways
;
and
now
reading
a
chapter
in
the
child
,
and
now
one
in
the
book
,
I
can
look
forward
,
and
with
advantage
,
into
the
subject
;
and
go
through
all
the
parts
of
education
tolerably
,
for
one
of
my
capacity
;
for
,
Sir
,
I
can
,
by
my
own
defects
,
and
what
I
have
wished
to
mend
,
know
how
to
judge
of
,
and
supply
that
part
of
life
which
carries
a
child
up
to
eleven
or
twelve
years
of
age
,
which
was
mine
,
when
my
lady
took
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
pretty
thought
,
Pamela
!
<EOS>
but
tell
me
,
who
will
part
with
their
child
,
think
you
?
<EOS>
Would
you
,
if
it
were
your
case
,
although
ever
so
well
assured
of
the
advantages
your
little
one
would
reap
by
it
?
 
<EOS>
For
do
n't
you
consider
,
that
the
child
ought
to
be
wholly
subjected
to
your
authority
?
<EOS>
That
its
father
or
mother
ought
seldom
to
see
it
;
because
it
should
think
itself
absolutely
dependent
upon
you
?
 
<EOS>
And
where
,
my
dear
,
will
you
meet
with
parents
so
resigned
?
 
<EOS>
Besides
,
one
would
have
the
child
descended
of
genteel
parents
,
and
not
such
as
could
do
nothing
for
it
;
otherwise
the
turn
of
mind
and
education
you
would
give
it
,
might
do
it
more
harm
than
good
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
All
this
,
Sir
,
is
very
true
.
<EOS>
But
have
you
no
other
objection
,
if
one
could
find
a
genteely
-
descended
young
Master
?
<EOS>
And
would
you
join
to
persuade
his
papa
to
give
me
up
his
power
,
only
from
three
months
to
three
months
,
as
I
liked
,
and
the
child
liked
,
and
as
the
papa
approved
of
my
proceedings
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
This
is
so
reasonable
,
with
these
last
conditions
,
Pamela
,
that
I
should
be
pleased
with
your
notion
,
if
it
could
be
put
in
practice
,
because
the
child
would
be
benefited
by
your
instruction
,
and
you
would
be
improved
in
an
art
,
which
I
could
wish
to
see
you
an
adept
in
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
But
,
perhaps
.
<EOS>
Sir
,
you
had
rather
it
were
a
girl
than
a
boy
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
had
,
my
dear
,
if
a
girl
could
be
found
,
whose
parents
would
give
her
up
to
you
;
but
I
suppose
you
have
some
boy
in
your
head
,
by
your
putting
it
upon
that
sex
at
first
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Let
me
see
,
Sir
,
you
say
you
are
in
a
good
humour
!
<EOS>
Let
me
see
if
you
be
;
"
 
looking
boldly
in
his
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
now
,
"
with
some
little
impatience
,
"
would
the
pretty
fool
be
at
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Only
,
Sir
,
that
you
have
nothing
to
do
,
but
to
speak
the
word
,
and
there
is
a
child
,
whose
papa
and
mamma
too
,
I
am
sure
,
would
consent
to
give
up
to
me
for
my
own
instruction
,
as
well
as
for
her
sake
;
and
if
,
to
speak
in
the
Scripture
phrase
,
I
have
found
grace
in
your
sight
,
kind
Sir
,
speak
this
word
to
the
dear
child
's
papa
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
have
you
thus
come
over
me
,
Pamela
!
 
<EOS>
Go
,
I
am
half
angry
with
you
,
for
leading
me
on
in
this
manner
against
myself
.
<EOS>
This
looks
so
artful
,
that
I
wo
n't
love
you
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Dear
Sir
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
dear
Madam
too
!
<EOS>
Be
gone
,
I
say
!
 
<EOS>
You
have
surprised
me
by
art
,
when
your
talent
is
nature
,
and
you
should
keep
to
that
!
"
  
<EOS>
I
was
sadly
baulked
,
and
had
neither
power
to
go
nor
stay
!
<EOS>
At
last
,
seeing
I
had
put
him
into
a
kind
of
flutter
,
as
now
he
had
put
me
,
I
moved
my
unwilling
feet
towards
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
He
took
a
turn
about
the
closet
meantime
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yet
stay
,
"
said
he
,
"
there
is
something
so
generous
in
your
art
,
that
,
on
recollection
,
I
can
not
part
with
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
took
notice
of
the
starting
tear
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
to
blame
!
 
<EOS>
You
had
surprised
me
so
,
that
my
hasty
temper
got
the
better
of
my
consideration
.
<EOS>
Let
me
kiss
away
this
pearly
fugitive
.
<EOS>
Forgive
me
,
my
dearest
love
!
<EOS>
What
an
inconsiderate
brute
am
I
,
when
compared
to
such
an
angel
as
my
Pamela
!
<EOS>
I
see
at
once
now
,
all
the
force
,
and
all
the
merit
,
of
your
amiable
generosity
:
and
<EOS>
to
make
you
amends
for
this
my
hastiness
,
I
will
coolly
consider
of
the
matter
,
and
will
either
satisfy
you
by
my
compliance
,
or
by
the
reasons
,
which
I
will
give
you
for
the
contrary
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
say
,
my
Pamela
,
can
you
forgive
my
harshness
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Can
I
!
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
indeed
,
Sir
,
"
pressing
his
hand
to
my
lips
;
"
and
bid
me
Go
,
and
Be
gone
,
twenty
times
a
-
day
,
if
I
am
to
be
thus
kindly
called
back
to
you
,
thus
nobly
and
condescendingly
treated
,
in
the
same
breath!-I
see
,
dear
Sir
,
"
continued
I
,
"
that
I
must
be
in
fault
,
if
ever
you
are
lastingly
displeased
with
me
.
<EOS>
For
as
soon
as
you
turn
yourself
about
,
your
anger
vanishes
,
and
you
make
me
rich
amends
for
a
few
harsh
words
.
<EOS>
Only
one
thing
,
dear
Sir
,
let
me
add
;
if
I
have
dealt
artfully
with
you
,
impute
it
to
my
fear
of
offending
you
,
through
the
nature
of
my
petition
,
and
not
to
design
;
and
that
I
took
the
example
of
the
prophet
,
to
King
David
,
in
the
parable
of
the
Ewe
-
Lamb
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
remember
it
,
my
dear
 
<EOS>
and
you
have
well
pointed
your
parable
,
and
had
nothing
to
do
,
but
to
say
"
Thou
art
the
man
!
"
<EOS>
"
  
I
am
called
upon
by
my
dear
benefactor
for
a
little
airing
,
and
he
suffers
me
only
to
conclude
this
long
letter
.
<EOS>
So
I
am
obliged
,
with
greater
abruptness
than
I
had
designed
,
to
mention
thankfully
your
ladyship
's
goodness
to
me
;
particularly
in
that
kind
,
kind
letter
,
in
behalf
of
my
dear
parents
,
had
a
certain
event
taken
place
.
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
shewed
it
to
me
this
morning
,
and
not
before
 
I
believe
,
for
fear
I
should
have
been
so
much
oppressed
by
the
sense
of
your
unmerited
goodness
to
me
,
had
he
let
me
known
of
it
before
your
departure
from
us
,
that
I
should
not
have
been
able
to
look
up
at
you
;
heaping
favours
and
blessings
upon
me
,
as
you
were
hourly
doing
besides
.
<EOS>
What
a
happy
creature
am
I
!
 
<EOS>
But
my
gratitude
runs
me
into
length
;
and
sorry
I
am
,
that
I
can
not
have
time
just
now
to
indulge
it
.
  
<EOS>
Is
there
nothing
,
my
dear
Lord
and
Lady
Davers
,
my
dear
Lady
Countess
,
and
my
good
Lord
C.
,
that
I
can
do
,
to
shew
at
least
,
that
I
have
a
will
,
and
am
not
an
ungrateful
,
sordid
creature
?
  
<EOS>
And
yet
,
if
you
give
me
power
to
do
any
thing
that
will
have
the
appearance
of
a
return
,
even
that
power
will
be
laying
a
fresh
obligation
upon
me
 
<EOS>
Which
,
however
,
I
should
be
very
proud
of
,
because
I
should
thereby
convince
you
,
by
more
than
words
,
how
much
I
am
(
most
particularly
,
my
dearest
Lady
Davers
,
my
sister
,
my
friend
,
my
patroness
)
,
your
most
obliged
and
faithful
servant
,
P.B.
  
<EOS>
Your
dear
brother
joins
in
respectful
thankfulness
to
his
four
noble
gossips
.
<EOS>
And
my
Billy
,
by
his
lips
,
subscribed
his
.
<EOS>
I
hope
so
to
direct
his
earliest
notions
,
as
to
make
him
sensible
of
his
dutiful
obligation
.
    
<EOS>
From
Lady
Davers
to
Mrs.
B.
  
MY
DEAREST
PAMELA
,
  
Talk
not
to
us
of
unreturnable
obligations
and
all
that
.
<EOS>
You
do
more
for
us
,
in
the
entertainment
you
give
us
all
,
by
your
letters
,
than
we
have
done
,
or
even
can
do
,
for
you
.
<EOS>
And
as
to
me
,
I
know
no
greater
pleasure
in
the
world
than
that
which
my
brother
's
felicity
and
yours
gives
me
.
<EOS>
God
continue
this
felicity
to
you
both
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
it
will
be
his
fault
,
and
not
yours
,
if
it
be
at
all
diminished
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
heard
some
idle
rumours
here
,
as
if
you
were
a
little
uneasy
of
late
;
and
having
not
had
a
letter
from
you
for
this
fortnight
past
,
it
makes
me
write
,
to
ask
you
how
you
all
do
?
<EOS>
and
whether
you
expected
an
answer
from
me
to
your
last
?
  
<EOS>
I
hope
you
wo
n't
be
punctilious
with
me
.
<EOS>
For
we
have
nothing
to
write
about
,
except
it
be
how
much
we
all
love
and
honour
you
;
and
that
you
believe
already
,
or
else
you
do
n't
do
us
justice
.
  
<EOS>
I
suppose
you
will
be
going
out
of
town
soon
,
now
the
parliament
is
rising
.
<EOS>
My
Lord
is
resolved
to
put
his
proxy
into
another
hand
,
and
intends
I
believe
,
to
take
my
brother
's
advice
in
it
.
<EOS>
Both
the
Earl
and
his
Lordship
are
highly
pleased
with
my
brother
's
moderate
and
independent
principles
.
<EOS>
He
has
got
great
credit
among
all
unprejudiced
men
,
by
the
part
he
acted
throughout
the
last
session
,
in
which
he
has
shown
,
that
he
would
no
more
join
to
distress
and
clog
the
wheels
of
government
,
by
an
unreasonable
opposition
,
than
he
would
do
the
dirty
work
of
any
administration
.
<EOS>
As
he
has
so
noble
a
fortune
and
wants
nothing
of
any
body
,
he
would
be
doubly
to
blame
,
to
take
any
other
part
than
that
of
his
country
,
in
which
he
has
so
great
a
stake
.
  
<EOS>
May
he
act
out
of
the
house
,
and
in
the
house
with
equal
honour
;
and
he
will
be
his
country
's
pride
,
and
your
pride
,
and
mine
too
!
<EOS>
which
is
the
wish
of
your
affectionate
sister
,
  
B.
DAVERS
.
    
<EOS>
MY
DEAREST
LADY
,
  
<EOS>
I
have
been
a
little
in
disorder
,
that
I
have
.
<EOS>
Some
few
rubs
have
happened
.
<EOS>
I
hope
they
will
be
happily
removed
,
I
am
unwilling
to
believe
all
that
is
said
.
<EOS>
But
this
is
a
wicked
town
.
<EOS>
I
wish
we
were
out
of
it
.
<EOS>
Yet
I
see
not
when
that
will
be
.
<EOS>
I
wish
Mr.
B.
would
permit
me
and
my
Billy
to
go
into
Kent
.
<EOS>
But
I
do
n't
care
to
leave
him
behind
me
,
neither
;
and
he
is
not
inclined
to
go
.
<EOS>
Excuse
my
brevity
,
my
dearest
lady
 
<EOS>
But
I
must
break
off
,
with
only
assuring
your
ladyship
,
that
I
am
,
and
ever
will
be
,
your
obliged
and
grateful
,
P.B.
    
MY
DEAREST
PAMELA
,
  
<EOS>
I
understand
things
are
not
so
well
as
I
wish
.
<EOS>
If
you
think
my
coming
up
to
town
,
and
residing
with
you
,
while
you
stay
,
will
be
of
service
,
or
help
you
to
get
out
of
it
,
I
will
set
out
directly
.
<EOS>
I
will
pretend
some
indisposition
,
and
a
desire
of
consulting
the
London
physicians
;
or
any
thing
you
shall
think
fit
to
be
done
,
by
your
affectionate
sister
,
and
faithful
friend
,
B.
DAVERS
    
MY
DEAREST
LADY
,
  
<EOS>
A
thousand
thanks
for
your
goodness
to
me
;
but
I
hope
all
will
be
well
.
<EOS>
I
hope
God
will
enable
me
to
act
so
prudent
a
part
,
as
will
touch
his
generous
breast
.
<EOS>
Be
pleased
to
tell
me
what
your
ladyship
has
heard
;
but
it
becomes
not
me
,
I
think
,
till
I
can
not
help
it
,
to
make
any
appeals
;
for
I
know
those
will
not
be
excused
;
and
I
do
all
I
can
to
suppress
my
uneasiness
before
him
.
<EOS>
But
I
pay
for
it
,
when
I
am
alone
.
<EOS>
My
nursery
and
my
reliance
on
God
<EOS>
(
I
should
have
said
the
latter
first
)
,
are
all
my
consolation
.
<EOS>
God
preserve
and
bless
you
,
my
good
lady
,
and
my
noble
lord
!
<EOS>
(
but
I
am
apt
to
think
your
ladyship
's
presence
will
not
avail
)
,
prays
your
affectionate
and
obliged
,
<EOS>
P.B.
    
Why
does
not
my
sweet
girl
subscribe
Sister
,
as
usual
?
<EOS>
I
have
done
nothing
amiss
to
you
!
<EOS>
I
love
you
dearly
,
and
ever
will
.
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
help
my
brother
's
faults
.
<EOS>
But
I
hope
he
treats
you
with
politeness
and
decency
.
<EOS>
He
shall
be
none
of
my
brother
if
he
do
n't
.
<EOS>
I
rest
a
great
deal
upon
your
prudence
:
and
it
will
be
very
meritorious
,
if
you
can
overcome
yourself
,
so
as
to
act
unexceptionably
,
though
it
may
not
be
deserved
on
this
occasion
.
<EOS>
For
in
doing
so
,
you
'll
have
a
triumph
over
nature
itself
;
for
,
my
dear
girl
,
as
you
have
formerly
owned
,
you
have
a
little
touch
of
jealousy
in
your
composition
.
  
<EOS>
What
I
have
heard
,
is
no
secret
to
any
body
.
<EOS>
The
injured
party
is
generally
the
last
who
hears
in
these
cases
,
and
you
shall
not
first
be
told
anything
by
me
that
must
afflict
you
,
but
can
not
you
,
more
than
it
does
me
.
<EOS>
God
give
you
patience
and
comfort
!
<EOS>
The
wicked
lady
has
a
deal
to
answer
for
,
to
disturb
such
an
uncommon
happiness
.
<EOS>
But
no
more
,
than
that
I
am
your
ever
-
affectionate
sister
,
B.
DAVERS
.
  
<EOS>
I
am
all
impatience
to
hear
how
you
conduct
yourself
upon
this
trying
occasion
.
<EOS>
Let
me
know
what
you
have
heard
,
and
how
you
came
to
hear
it
.
    
<EOS>
Why
do
n't
I
subscribe
Sister
?
<EOS>
asks
my
dearest
Lady
Davers
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
had
the
courage
to
do
it
of
late
.
<EOS>
For
my
title
to
that
honour
arises
from
the
dear
,
thrice
dear
Mr.
B.
<EOS>
And
how
long
I
may
be
permitted
to
call
him
mine
,
I
can
not
say
.
<EOS>
But
since
you
command
it
,
I
will
call
your
ladyship
by
that
beloved
name
,
let
the
rest
happen
as
God
shall
see
fit
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
can
not
be
unpolite
,
in
the
main
;
but
he
is
cold
,
and
a
little
cross
,
and
short
in
his
speeches
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
try
to
hide
my
grief
from
everybody
,
and
most
from
him
:
for
neither
my
parents
,
nor
Miss
Darnford
know
anything
from
me
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jervis
,
from
whom
I
seldom
hide
any
thing
,
as
she
is
on
the
spot
with
me
,
hears
not
my
complainings
,
nor
my
uneasiness
;
for
I
would
not
lessen
the
dear
man
.
<EOS>
He
may
yet
see
the
error
of
the
way
he
is
in
.
<EOS>
God
grant
it
,
for
his
own
sake
as
well
as
mine
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
even
sorry
your
ladyship
is
afflicted
with
the
knowledge
of
the
matter
.
  
<EOS>
The
unhappy
lady
(
God
forgive
her
!
)
is
to
be
pitied
:
she
loves
him
,
and
having
strong
passions
,
and
being
unused
to
be
controlled
,
is
lost
to
a
sense
of
honour
and
justice
.
 
<EOS>
From
these
wicked
masquerades
springs
all
the
unhappiness
;
my
Spaniard
was
too
amiable
,
and
met
with
a
lady
who
was
no
Nun
,
but
in
habit
.
<EOS>
Every
one
was
taken
with
him
in
that
habit
,
so
suited
to
the
natural
dignity
of
his
person
!
 
<EOS>
O
these
wicked
masquerades
!
  
<EOS>
I
am
all
patience
in
appearance
,
all
uneasiness
in
reality
.
<EOS>
I
did
not
think
I
could
,
especially
in
this
most
affecting
point
,
be
such
an
hypocrite
.
<EOS>
Your
ladyship
knows
not
what
it
has
cost
me
,
to
be
able
to
assume
that
character
!
<EOS>
Yet
my
eyes
are
swelled
with
crying
,
and
look
red
,
although
I
am
always
breathing
on
my
hand
,
and
patting
them
with
it
,
and
my
warm
breath
,
to
hide
the
distress
that
will
,
from
my
overcharged
heart
,
appear
in
them
.
  
<EOS>
Then
he
says
,
"
What
's
the
matter
with
the
little
fool
!
<EOS>
You
are
always
in
this
way
of
late
!
<EOS>
What
ails
you
,
Pamela
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Only
a
little
vapourish
,
Sir
!
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
be
angry
at
me
!
 
<EOS>
Billy
,
I
thought
,
was
not
very
well
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
This
boy
will
spoil
your
temper
:
at
this
rate
,
what
should
be
your
joy
,
will
become
your
misfortune
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
receive
me
in
this
manner
,
I
charge
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
In
what
manner
.
<EOS>
Sir
?
<EOS>
I
always
receive
you
with
a
grateful
heart
!
<EOS>
If
any
thing
troubles
me
,
it
is
in
your
absence
:
but
see
,
Sir
"
<EOS>
(
then
I
try
to
smile
,
and
seem
pleased
)
,
"
I
am
all
sunshine
,
<EOS>
now
you
are
come
!
 
<EOS>
do
n't
you
see
I
am
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
your
sunshine
of
late
is
all
through
a
cloud
!
<EOS>
I
know
not
what
's
the
matter
with
you
.
<EOS>
Your
temper
will
alter
,
and
then
"
  
"
It
sha
n't
alter
,
Sir
 
<EOS>
it
sha
n't
 
if
I
can
help
it
.
"
<EOS>
And
then
I
kissed
his
hand
;
<EOS>
that
dear
hand
,
that
,
perhaps
,
was
last
about
his
more
beloved
Countess
's
neck
 
<EOS>
Distracting
reflection
!
  
<EOS>
But
come
,
may
-
be
<EOS>
I
think
the
worst
!
<EOS>
To
be
sure
I
do
!
<EOS>
For
my
apprehensions
were
ever
aforehand
with
events
;
and
bad
must
be
the
case
,
if
it
be
worse
than
I
think
it
.
  
<EOS>
You
command
me
to
let
you
know
what
I
have
heard
,
and
how
I
came
to
hear
it
.
<EOS>
I
told
your
ladyship
in
one
of
my
former
that
two
gentlemen
brought
up
to
the
law
,
but
above
the
practice
of
it
,
though
I
doubt
,
not
above
practices
less
honourable
,
had
visited
us
on
coming
to
town
.
  
<EOS>
They
have
been
often
here
since
,
Mr.
Turner
particularly
:
and
sometimes
by
himself
,
when
Mr.
B.
has
happened
to
be
out
:
and
he
it
was
,
as
I
guessed
,
that
gave
me
,
at
the
wicked
masquerade
,
the
advice
to
look
after
my
Musidorus
.
  
<EOS>
I
did
not
like
their
visits
,
and
his
much
less
:
for
he
seemed
to
be
a
man
of
intriguing
spirit
.
<EOS>
But
about
three
weeks
ago
,
Mr.
B.
setting
out
upon
a
party
of
pleasure
to
Oxford
,
he
came
and
pretended
great
business
with
me
.
<EOS>
I
was
at
breakfast
in
the
parlour
,
only
Polly
attending
me
,
and
admitted
him
,
to
drink
a
dish
of
chocolate
with
me
.
<EOS>
When
Polly
had
stept
out
,
he
told
me
,
after
many
apologies
,
that
he
had
discovered
who
the
nun
was
at
the
masquerade
,
that
had
engaged
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
  
I
said
it
was
very
indifferent
to
me
who
the
lady
was
.
  
<EOS>
He
replied
(
making
still
more
apologies
,
and
pretending
great
reluctance
to
speak
out
)
,
that
it
was
no
less
a
lady
than
the
young
Countess
Dowager
of
 
,
a
lady
noted
for
her
wit
and
beauty
,
but
of
a
gay
disposition
,
though
he
believed
not
yet
culpable
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
alarmed
;
but
would
not
let
him
see
it
;
and
told
Mr.
Turner
,
that
I
was
so
well
satisfied
in
Mr.
B.
's
affection
for
me
,
and
his
well
-
known
honour
,
that
I
could
not
think
myself
obliged
to
any
gentleman
who
should
endeavour
to
give
me
a
less
opinion
of
either
than
I
ought
to
have
.
  
<EOS>
He
then
bluntly
told
me
,
that
the
very
party
Mr.
B.
was
upon
,
was
with
the
Countess
for
one
,
and
Lord
#
#
#
#
,
who
had
married
her
sister
.
  
<EOS>
I
said
,
I
was
glad
he
was
in
such
good
company
,
and
wished
him
every
pleasure
in
it
.
  
<EOS>
He
hoped
,
he
said
,
he
might
trust
to
my
discretion
,
that
I
would
not
let
Mr.
B.
know
from
whom
I
had
the
information
:
that
,
indeed
,
his
motive
in
mentioning
it
was
self
-
interest
;
having
presumed
to
make
some
overture
of
an
honourable
nature
to
the
Countess
,
in
his
own
behalf
;
which
had
been
rejected
since
that
masquerade
night
:
and
he
hoped
the
prudent
use
I
would
make
of
the
intimation
,
might
somehow
be
a
means
to
break
off
that
correspondence
,
before
it
was
attended
with
bad
consequences
.
  
<EOS>
I
told
him
coldly
,
though
it
stung
me
to
the
heart
,
that
I
was
fully
assured
of
Mr.
B.
's
honour
;
and
was
sorry
he
,
Mr.
Turner
,
had
so
bad
an
opinion
of
a
lady
to
whom
he
professed
so
high
a
consideration
.
<EOS>
And
rising
up
 
"
Will
you
excuse
me
,
Sir
,
that
I
can
not
attend
at
all
to
such
a
subject
as
this
?
<EOS>
I
think
I
ought
not
:
and
so
must
withdraw
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Only
,
Madam
,
one
word
.
"
<EOS>
He
offered
to
take
my
hand
,
but
I
would
not
permit
it
.
<EOS>
He
then
swore
a
great
oath
,
that
he
had
told
me
his
true
and
only
motive
;
that
letters
had
passed
between
the
Countess
and
Mr.
B.
,
adding
,
"
<EOS>
But
I
beg
you
'll
keep
it
within
your
own
breast
;
else
,
from
two
such
hasty
spirits
as
his
and
mine
,
it
might
be
attended
with
still
worse
consequences
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
will
never
.
<EOS>
Sir
,
enter
into
a
subject
that
is
not
proper
to
be
communicated
every
tittle
of
it
to
Mr.
B.
;
and
this
must
be
my
excuse
for
withdrawing
.
"
<EOS>
And
away
I
went
from
him
.
  
<EOS>
Your
ladyship
will
judge
with
how
uneasy
a
heart
;
which
became
more
so
,
when
I
sat
down
to
reflect
upon
what
he
had
told
me
.
<EOS>
But
I
was
resolved
to
give
it
as
little
credit
as
I
could
,
or
that
any
thing
would
come
of
it
,
till
Mr.
B.
's
own
behaviour
should
convince
me
,
to
my
affliction
,
that
I
had
some
reason
to
be
alarmed
:
so
I
opened
not
my
lips
about
it
,
not
even
to
Mrs.
Jervis
.
  
<EOS>
At
Mr.
B.
's
return
,
I
received
him
in
my
usual
affectionate
and
unreserved
manner
:
and
he
behaved
himself
to
me
with
his
accustomed
goodness
and
kindness
:
or
,
at
least
,
with
so
little
difference
,
that
had
not
Mr.
Turner
's
officiousness
made
me
more
watchful
,
I
should
not
have
perceived
it
.
  
<EOS>
But
next
day
a
letter
was
brought
by
a
footman
for
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
He
was
out
:
<EOS>
so
John
gave
it
to
me
.
<EOS>
The
superscription
was
a
lady
's
writing
:
the
seal
,
the
Dowager
Lady
's
,
with
a
coronet
.
<EOS>
This
gave
me
great
uneasiness
;
and
when
Mr.
B.
came
in
,
I
said
,
"
Here
is
a
letter
for
you
.
<EOS>
Sir
;
and
from
a
lady
too
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
then
,
"
said
he
,
with
quickness
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
baulked
,
and
withdrew
.
<EOS>
For
I
saw
him
turn
the
seal
about
and
about
,
as
if
he
would
see
whether
I
had
endeavoured
to
look
into
it
.
  
<EOS>
He
needed
not
to
have
been
so
afraid
;
for
I
would
not
have
done
such
a
thing
had
I
known
my
life
was
to
depend
upon
it
.
<EOS>
I
went
up
,
and
could
not
help
weeping
at
his
quick
answer
;
yet
I
did
my
endeavour
to
hide
it
,
when
he
came
up
.
  
<EOS>
"
Was
not
my
girl
a
little
inquisitive
upon
me
just
now
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
spoke
pleasantly
.
<EOS>
Sir
 
<EOS>
But
you
were
very
quick
on
your
girl
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
'
Tis
my
temper
,
my
dear
 
<EOS>
You
know
<EOS>
I
mean
nothing
.
<EOS>
You
should
not
mind
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
not
,
Sir
,
if
I
had
been
used
to
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
looked
at
me
with
sternness
,
"
<EOS>
Do
you
doubt
my
honour
,
Madam
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Madam
!
<EOS>
I
did
you
say
.
<EOS>
Sir
?
 
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
take
that
word
!
 
<EOS>
Dear
Sir
,
call
it
back
 
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
be
called
Madam
!
 
<EOS>
Call
me
your
girl
,
your
rustic
,
your
Pamela
 
call
me
any
thing
but
Madam
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
charmer
,
then
,
my
life
,
my
soul
:
will
any
of
those
do
?
"
and
saluted
me
:
"
<EOS>
but
whatever
you
do
,
let
me
not
see
that
you
have
any
doubts
of
my
honour
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
very
mention
of
the
word
<EOS>
,
dear
Sir
,
is
a
security
to
me
;
I
want
no
other
;
I
can
not
doubt
:
<EOS>
but
if
you
speak
short
to
me
,
how
shall
I
bear
that
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
withdrew
,
speaking
nothing
of
the
contents
of
his
letter
;
as
I
dare
say
he
would
,
had
the
subject
been
such
as
he
chose
to
mention
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
We
being
alone
,
after
supper
,
I
took
the
liberty
to
ask
him
,
who
was
of
his
party
to
Oxford
?
<EOS>
He
named
the
Viscountess
 
,
and
her
lord
,
Mr.
Howard
,
and
his
daughter
,
Mr.
Herbert
and
his
lady
:
"
<EOS>
And
I
had
a
partner
too
,
my
dear
,
to
represent
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
much
obliged
to
the
lady
,
Sir
,
be
she
who
she
would
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
my
dear
,
you
are
so
engaged
in
your
nursery
!
<EOS>
Then
this
was
a
sudden
thing
;
as
you
know
I
told
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
Sir
,
as
long
as
it
was
agreeable
to
you
,
I
had
nothing
to
do
,
but
to
be
pleased
with
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
watched
my
eyes
,
and
the
turn
of
my
countenance
 
<EOS>
"
You
look
,
Pamela
,
as
if
you
'd
be
glad
to
return
the
lady
thanks
in
person
.
<EOS>
Shall
I
engage
her
to
visit
you
?
<EOS>
She
longs
to
see
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
 
Sir
,
"
hesitated
I
,
"
as
you
please
 
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
 
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
be
displeased
<EOS>
"
  
"
Displeased
?
"
<EOS>
interrupted
he
:
"
<EOS>
why
that
word
?
<EOS>
and
why
that
hesitation
in
your
answer
?
<EOS>
You
speak
very
volubly
,
my
dear
,
when
you
're
not
moved
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
Sir
,
"
said
I
,
almost
as
quick
as
he
was
,
"
why
should
I
be
moved
?
<EOS>
What
occasion
is
there
for
it
?
<EOS>
I
hope
you
have
a
better
opinion
of
me
than
"
  
"
<EOS>
Than
what
,
Pamela
?
 
<EOS>
What
would
you
say
?
<EOS>
I
know
you
are
a
little
jealous
rogue
<EOS>
,
I
know
you
are
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
dear
Sir
,
why
do
you
impute
jealousy
to
me
on
this
score
?
 
<EOS>
What
a
creature
must
I
be
,
if
you
could
not
be
abroad
with
a
lady
,
but
I
must
be
jealous
of
you
?
 
<EOS>
No
,
Sir
,
I
have
reason
to
rely
upon
your
honour
;
and
I
do
rely
upon
it
;
and
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
what
?
<EOS>
Why
,
my
dear
,
you
are
giving
me
assurances
,
as
if
you
thought
the
case
required
it
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
"
thought
I
,
"
<EOS>
so
it
does
<EOS>
,
I
see
too
plainly
,
or
apprehend
I
do
;
but
I
durst
not
say
so
,
nor
give
him
any
hint
about
my
informant
;
though
now
confirmed
of
the
truth
of
what
Mr.
Turner
had
said
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Yet
I
resolved
,
if
possible
,
not
to
alter
my
conduct
.
<EOS>
But
my
frequent
weepings
,
when
by
myself
,
could
not
be
hid
as
I
wished
;
my
eyes
not
keeping
my
heart
's
counsel
.
  
<EOS>
And
this
gives
occasion
to
some
of
the
stern
words
which
I
have
mentioned
above
.
  
<EOS>
All
that
he
further
said
at
this
time
was
,
with
a
negligent
,
yet
a
determined
air
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Pamela
,
do
n't
be
doubtful
of
my
honour
.
<EOS>
You
know
how
much
I
love
you
.
<EOS>
But
,
one
day
or
other
I
shall
gratify
this
lady
's
curiosity
,
and
bring
her
to
pay
you
a
visit
,
and
you
shall
see
you
need
not
be
ashamed
of
her
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Whenever
you
please
,
Sir
,
"
was
all
I
cared
to
say
farther
;
for
I
saw
he
was
upon
the
catch
,
and
looked
steadfastly
upon
me
whenever
I
moved
my
lips
;
and
I
am
not
a
finished
hypocrite
,
and
he
can
read
the
lines
of
one
's
face
,
and
the
motions
of
one
's
heart
,
I
think
.
  
<EOS>
I
am
sure
mine
is
a
very
uneasy
one
.
<EOS>
But
till
I
reflected
,
and
weighed
well
the
matter
,
it
was
worse
;
and
my
natural
imperfection
of
this
sort
made
me
see
a
necessity
to
be
more
watchful
over
myself
,
and
to
doubt
my
own
prudence
.
<EOS>
And
thus
I
reasoned
when
he
withdrew
:
  
"
Here
<EOS>
,
"
thought
I
,
"
I
have
had
a
greater
proportion
of
happiness
without
alloy
,
fallen
to
my
share
,
than
any
of
my
sex
;
and
I
ought
to
be
prepared
for
some
trials
.
  
<EOS>
"
"
Tis
true
,
this
is
of
the
sorest
kind
:
'
tis
worse
than
death
itself
to
me
,
who
had
an
opinion
of
the
dear
man
's
reformation
,
and
prided
myself
not
a
little
on
that
account
.
<EOS>
So
that
the
blow
is
full
upon
my
sore
place
.
'
<EOS>
Tis
on
the
side
I
could
be
the
most
easily
penetrated
.
<EOS>
But
Achilles
could
be
touched
only
in
his
heel
;
and
if
he
was
to
die
by
an
enemy
's
hands
,
must
not
the
arrow
find
out
that
only
vulnerable
place
?
<EOS>
My
jealousy
is
that
place
with
me
,
as
your
ladyship
observes
;
but
it
is
seated
deeper
than
the
heel
:
it
is
in
my
heart
.
<EOS>
The
barbed
dart
has
found
that
out
,
and
there
it
sticks
up
to
the
very
feathers
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yet
,
"
thought
I
,
"
I
will
take
care
,
that
I
do
not
exasperate
him
by
upbraidings
,
when
I
should
try
to
move
him
by
patience
and
forbearance
.
<EOS>
For
the
breach
of
his
duty
can
not
warrant
the
neglect
of
mine
.
<EOS>
My
business
is
to
reclaim
,
and
not
to
provoke
.
<EOS>
And
when
,
if
it
please
God
,
this
storm
shall
be
over
-
blown
,
let
me
not
,
by
my
present
behaviour
,
leave
any
room
for
heart
-
burnings
;
but
,
like
a
skilful
surgeon
,
so
heal
the
wound
to
the
bottom
,
though
the
operation
be
painful
,
that
it
may
not
fester
,
and
break
out
again
with
fresh
violence
,
on
future
misunderstandings
,
if
any
shall
happen
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
but
,
"
thought
I
,
"
let
the
worst
come
to
the
worst
,
he
perhaps
may
be
so
good
as
to
permit
me
to
pass
the
remainder
of
my
days
with
my
dear
Billy
,
in
Kent
,
with
my
father
and
mother
;
and
so
,
when
I
can
not
rejoice
in
possession
of
a
virtuous
husband
,
I
shall
be
employed
in
praying
for
him
,
and
enjoy
a
two
-
fold
happiness
,
that
of
doing
my
own
duty
to
my
dear
baby
 
a
pleasing
entertainment
this
!
<EOS>
and
that
of
comforting
my
worthy
parents
,
and
being
comforted
by
them
 
a
no
small
consolation
!
<EOS>
And
who
knows
,
but
I
may
be
permitted
to
steal
a
visit
now
-
and
-
then
to
dear
Lady
Davers
,
and
be
called
Sister
,
and
be
deemed
a
faultless
sister
too
?
"
<EOS>
But
remember
,
my
dear
lady
,
that
if
ever
it
comes
to
this
,
I
will
not
bear
,
that
,
for
my
sake
,
you
shall
,
with
too
much
asperity
,
blame
your
brother
;
for
I
will
be
ingenious
to
find
excuses
or
extenuations
for
him
;
and
I
will
now
-
and
-
then
,
in
some
disguised
habit
,
steal
the
pleasure
of
seeing
him
and
his
happier
Countess
;
and
give
him
,
with
a
silent
tear
,
my
blessing
for
the
good
<EOS>
I
and
mine
have
reaped
at
his
hands
.
  
<EOS>
But
<EOS>
oh
!
if
he
takes
from
me
my
Billy
,
who
must
,
after
all
,
be
his
heir
,
and
gives
him
to
the
cruel
Countess
,
he
will
at
once
burst
asunder
the
strings
of
my
heart
!
<EOS>
For
,
oh
,
my
happy
rivaless
!
<EOS>
if
you
tear
from
me
my
husband
,
he
is
in
his
own
disposal
,
and
I
can
not
help
it
:
nor
can
I
indeed
,
if
he
will
give
you
my
Billy
.
<EOS>
But
this
I
am
sure
of
,
that
my
child
and
my
life
must
go
together
!
  
<EOS>
Your
ladyship
will
think
I
rave
.
<EOS>
Indeed
I
am
almost
crazed
at
times
.
<EOS>
For
the
dear
man
is
so
negligent
,
<EOS>
so
cold
,
so
haughty
,
that
I
can
not
bear
it
.
<EOS>
He
says
,
just
now
,
"
You
are
quite
altered
,
Pamela
.
<EOS>
"
I
believe
I
am
.
<EOS>
Madam
.
<EOS>
But
what
can
I
do
?
<EOS>
He
knows
not
that
I
know
so
much
.
<EOS>
I
dare
not
tell
him
.
<EOS>
For
he
will
have
me
then
reveal
my
intelligencer
:
and
what
may
be
the
case
between
them
?
  
<EOS>
I
weep
in
the
night
,
when
he
is
asleep
;
and
in
the
day
when
he
is
absent
:
and
I
am
happy
when
I
can
,
unobserved
,
steal
this
poor
relief
.
<EOS>
I
believe
already
I
have
shed
as
many
tears
as
would
drown
my
baby
.
<EOS>
How
many
more
I
may
have
to
shed
,
God
only
knows
!
<EOS>
For
,
O
Madam
,
after
all
my
fortitude
,
and
my
recollection
,
to
fall
from
so
much
happiness
,
and
so
soon
,
is
a
trying
thing
!
  
<EOS>
But
I
will
still
hope
the
best
,
and
should
this
matter
blow
over
,
I
shall
be
ashamed
of
my
weakness
,
and
the
trouble
I
must
give
to
your
generous
heart
,
for
one
so
undeservedly
favoured
by
you
,
as
your
obliged
sister
,
and
most
humble
servant
,
P.B.
  
Dear
Madam
,
let
no
soul
see
any
part
of
this
our
present
correspondence
,
for
your
brother
's
sake
,
and
your
sake
,
and
my
sake
.
    
<EOS>
MY
DEAREST
PAMELA
,
  
<EOS>
You
need
not
be
afraid
of
any
body
's
knowing
what
passes
between
us
on
this
cutting
subject
.
<EOS>
Though
I
hear
of
it
from
every
mouth
,
yet
I
pretend
'
tis
all
falsehood
and
malice
.
<EOS>
Yet
Lady
Betty
will
have
it
that
there
is
more
in
it
than
I
will
own
;
and
that
I
know
my
brother
's
wickedness
by
my
pensive
looks
.
<EOS>
She
will
make
a
vow
,
she
says
,
never
to
marry
any
man
living
.
  
<EOS>
I
am
greatly
moved
by
your
affecting
periods
.
<EOS>
Charming
Pamela
!
<EOS>
what
a
tempest
<EOS>
do
you
raise
in
one
's
mind
,
when
you
please
,
and
lay
it
too
,
at
your
own
will
!
<EOS>
Your
colourings
are
strong
;
but
,
I
hope
,
your
imagination
carries
you
much
farther
than
it
is
possible
<EOS>
he
should
go
.
  
<EOS>
I
am
pleased
with
your
prudent
reasonings
,
and
your
wise
resolutions
.
<EOS>
I
see
nobody
can
advise
or
help
you
.
<EOS>
God
only
can
!
<EOS>
And
his
direction
you
beg
so
hourly
,
that
I
make
no
doubt
you
will
have
it
.
  
<EOS>
What
vexes
me
is
,
that
when
the
noble
uncle
of
this
vile
lady
(
why
do
n't
you
call
her
so
as
well
as
I
?
)
 
expostulated
with
her
on
the
scandals
she
brought
upon
her
character
and
family
,
she
pretended
to
argue
(
foolish
creature
!
)
<EOS>
to
polygamy
:
and
said
,
she
had
rather
be
a
certain
gentleman
's
second
wife
,
than
the
first
to
the
greatest
man
in
England
.
  
<EOS>
I
leave
you
to
your
own
workings
;
but
if
I
find
your
prudence
unrewarded
by
the
wretch
,
the
storm
you
saw
raised
at
the
Hall
,
shall
be
nothing
to
the
hurricane
I
will
excite
,
to
tear
up
by
the
roots
all
the
happiness
the
two
wretches
propose
to
themselves
.
  
<EOS>
Do
n't
let
my
intelligence
,
which
is
undoubted
,
grieve
you
over
-
much
.
<EOS>
Try
some
way
to
move
the
wretch
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
done
by
touching
his
generosity
:
he
has
that
in
some
perfection
.
<EOS>
But
how
in
this
case
to
move
it
,
is
beyond
my
power
or
skill
to
prescribe
.
<EOS>
God
bless
you
,
my
dearest
Pamela
!
<EOS>
You
shall
be
my
only
sister
.
<EOS>
And
I
will
never
own
my
brother
,
if
he
be
so
base
to
your
superlative
merit
.
<EOS>
Adieu
once
more
,
from
your
sister
and
friend
,
B.
DAVERS
.
    
<EOS>
MY
DEAREST
LADY
,
  
A
thousand
thanks
for
your
kind
,
your
truly
sisterly
letter
and
advice
.
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
is
just
returned
from
a
tour
to
Portsmouth
,
with
the
Countess
,
I
believe
,
but
am
not
sure
.
  
<EOS>
Here
I
am
forced
to
leave
off
.
  
<EOS>
Let
me
scratch
through
this
last
surmise
.
<EOS>
It
seems
she
was
not
with
him
.
<EOS>
This
is
some
comfort
.
  
<EOS>
He
is
very
kind
:
and
Billy
not
being
well
when
he
came
in
,
my
grief
passed
off
without
blame
.
<EOS>
He
had
said
many
tender
things
to
me
;
but
added
,
that
if
I
gave
myself
so
much
uneasiness
every
time
the
child
ailed
any
thing
,
he
would
hire
the
nurse
to
overlay
him
.
<EOS>
Bless
me
.
<EOS>
Madam
!
<EOS>
what
hard
-
hearted
shocking
things
are
these
men
capable
of
saying
!
 
<EOS>
The
farthest
from
their
hearts
,
indeed
<EOS>
;
so
they
had
need
 
<EOS>
For
he
was
as
glad
of
the
child
's
being
better
as
I
could
be
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
morning
he
went
out
in
the
chariot
for
about
an
hour
,
and
returned
in
a
good
humour
,
saying
twenty
agreeable
things
to
me
,
which
makes
me
so
proud
,
and
so
pleased
!
  
<EOS>
He
is
gone
out
again
.
  
<EOS>
Could
I
but
find
this
matter
happily
conquered
,
for
his
own
soul
's
sake
!
 
<EOS>
But
he
seems
,
by
what
your
ladyship
mentions
,
to
have
carried
this
polygamy
point
with
the
lady
.
  
<EOS>
Can
I
live
with
him
.
<EOS>
Madam
 
ought
I
 
if
this
be
the
case
?
<EOS>
I
have
it
under
his
hand
,
that
the
laws
of
his
country
were
sufficient
to
deter
him
from
that
practice
.
<EOS>
But
alas
!
<EOS>
he
knew
not
this
countess
then
!
  
<EOS>
But
here
I
must
break
off
.
  
<EOS>
He
is
returned
,
and
coming
up
.
<EOS>
"
Go
into
my
bosom
for
the
present
,
O
letter
dedicated
to
dear
Lady
Davers
 
Come
to
my
hand
the
play
employment
,
so
unsuited
to
my
present
afflicted
mind
!
"
 
<EOS>
Here
he
comes
!
  
<EOS>
O
,
Madam
!
<EOS>
my
heart
is
almost
broken
!
 
<EOS>
Just
now
Mr.
B.
tells
me
,
that
the
Countess
Dowager
and
the
Viscountess
,
her
sister
,
are
to
be
here
to
see
my
Billy
,
and
to
drink
tea
with
me
,
this
very
afternoon
!
  
<EOS>
I
was
all
confusion
when
he
told
me
this
.
<EOS>
I
looked
around
and
around
,
and
upon
every
thing
but
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Will
not
my
friends
be
welcome
,
Pamela
?
"
said
he
sternly
.
  
<EOS>
"
O
yes
,
very
welcome
!
<EOS>
But
I
have
these
wretched
vapours
so
,
that
I
wish
I
might
be
excused
 
<EOS>
I
wish
I
might
be
allowed
to
take
an
airing
in
the
chariot
for
two
or
three
hours
;
for
I
shall
not
be
fit
to
be
seen
by
such
 
ladies
,
"
said
I
,
half
out
of
breath
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
'll
be
fit
to
be
seen
by
nobody
,
my
dear
,
if
you
go
on
thus
.
<EOS>
But
,
do
as
you
please
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
was
going
,
and
I
took
his
hand
:
"
Stay
,
<EOS>
dear
Sir
,
let
me
know
what
you
would
have
me
do
.
<EOS>
If
you
would
have
me
stay
,
I
will
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
To
be
sure
I
would
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Sir
,
then
I
will
.
<EOS>
For
it
is
hard
,
"
thought
I
,
"
if
an
innocent
person
can
not
look
up
in
her
own
house
too
,
as
it
now
is
,
as
I
may
say
,
to
a
guilty
one
!
<EOS>
Guilty
in
her
heart
,
at
least
!
 
<EOS>
Though
,
poor
lady
,
I
hope
she
is
not
so
in
fact
;
and
,
if
God
hears
my
prayers
,
never
will
,
for
all
three
of
our
sakes
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
But
,
Madam
,
think
of
me
,
<EOS>
what
a
task
I
have
!
 
<EOS>
How
my
heart
throbs
in
my
bosom
!
<EOS>
How
I
tremble
!
<EOS>
how
I
struggle
with
myself
!
<EOS>
What
rules
I
form
for
my
behaviour
to
this
naughty
lady
!
<EOS>
How
they
are
dashed
in
pieces
as
soon
as
formed
,
and
new
ones
taken
up
!
<EOS>
And
yet
I
doubt
myself
when
I
come
to
the
test
.
  
<EOS>
But
one
thing
will
help
me
.
<EOS>
I
pity
the
poor
lady
;
and
as
she
comes
with
the
heart
of
a
robber
,
to
invade
me
in
my
lawful
right
,
I
pride
myself
in
a
superiority
over
this
countess
;
and
will
endeavour
to
shew
her
the
country
girl
in
a
light
which
would
better
become
her
to
appear
in
.
  
<EOS>
I
must
be
forced
to
leave
off
here
;
for
Mr.
B.
is
just
come
in
to
receive
his
guests
;
and
I
am
in
a
sad
flutter
upon
it
.
<EOS>
All
my
resolution
fails
me
;
what
shall
I
do
?
<EOS>
O
that
this
countess
was
come
and
gone
!
  
<EOS>
I
have
one
comfort
,
however
,
in
the
midst
of
all
my
griefs
;
and
that
is
in
your
ladyship
's
goodness
,
which
gives
me
leave
to
assume
the
honoured
title
<EOS>
,
that
let
what
may
happen
,
will
always
give
me
equal
pride
and
pleasure
,
in
subscribing
myself
,
your
ladyship
's
most
obliged
sister
,
and
humble
servant
,
  
P.B.
    
MY
DEAR
LADY
,
  
<EOS>
I
will
now
pursue
my
last
affecting
subject
;
for
the
visit
is
over
;
but
a
sad
situation
I
am
in
with
Mr.
B.
for
all
that
:
but
,
bad
as
it
is
,
I
'll
try
to
forget
it
,
till
I
come
to
it
in
course
.
  
<EOS>
At
four
in
the
afternoon
Mr.
B.
came
in
to
receive
his
guests
,
whom
he
expected
at
five
.
<EOS>
He
came
up
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
had
just
closed
my
last
letter
;
but
put
it
up
,
and
set
before
me
your
ladyship
's
play
subjects
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
So
,
Pamela
!
 
<EOS>
How
do
you
do
now
?
"
  
<EOS>
Your
ladyship
may
guess
,
by
what
I
wrote
before
,
that
I
could
not
give
any
extraordinary
account
of
myself
 
"
<EOS>
As
well
 
<EOS>
as
well
,
Sir
,
as
possible
;
"
half
out
of
breath
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
give
yourself
strange
melancholy
airs
of
late
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
All
that
cheerfulness
,
which
used
to
delight
me
whenever
I
saw
you
<EOS>
,
I
am
sorry
for
it
,
is
quite
vanished
.
<EOS>
You
and
I
must
shortly
have
a
little
serious
talk
together
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
When
you
please
.
<EOS>
Sir
.
<EOS>
I
believe
it
is
only
being
used
to
this
smoky
thick
air
of
London
!
 
<EOS>
I
shall
be
better
when
you
carry
me
into
the
country
.
<EOS>
I
dare
say
I
shall
.
<EOS>
But
I
never
was
in
London
so
long
before
,
you
know
,
Sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
All
in
good
time
,
Pamela
!
 
<EOS>
But
is
this
the
best
appearance
you
choose
to
make
,
to
receive
such
guests
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
it
displeases
you
.
<EOS>
Sir
,
I
will
dress
otherwise
in
a
minute
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
look
well
in
any
thing
.
<EOS>
But
I
thought
you
'd
have
been
better
dressed
.
<EOS>
Yet
it
would
never
have
<EOS>
less
become
you
;
for
of
late
your
eyes
have
lost
that
brilliancy
that
used
to
strike
me
with
a
lustre
,
much
surpassing
that
of
the
finest
diamonds
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
for
it
,
Sir
.
<EOS>
But
as
I
never
could
pride
myself
in
deserving
such
a
kind
of
compliment
,
I
should
be
too
happy
,
forgive
me
,
<EOS>
my
dearest
Mr.
B.
,
if
the
failure
be
not
rather
in
your
eyes
,
than
in
mine
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
looked
at
me
steadfastly
.
<EOS>
"
I
fear
,
Pamela
 
But
do
n't
be
a
fool
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
angry
with
me
.
<EOS>
Sir
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
No
,
not
I.
"
  
"
<EOS>
Would
you
have
me
dress
better
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
not
I.
<EOS>
If
your
eyes
looked
a
little
more
brilliant
,
you
want
no
addition
.
<EOS>
"
Down
he
went
.
  
<EOS>
Strange
short
speeches
,
these
,
my
lady
,
to
what
you
have
heard
from
his
dear
mouth
!
 
<EOS>
"
Yet
they
shall
not
rob
me
of
the
merit
of
a
patient
sufferer
,
I
am
resolved
,
"
thought
I.
  
<EOS>
Now
,
my
lady
,
as
I
doubted
not
my
rival
would
come
adorned
with
every
outward
ornament
,
I
put
on
only
a
white
damask
gown
,
having
no
desire
to
vie
with
her
in
appearance
;
for
a
virtuous
and
honest
heart
is
my
glory
,
I
bless
God
!
<EOS>
I
wish
the
countess
had
the
same
to
boast
of
!
  
<EOS>
About
five
,
their
ladyships
came
in
the
countess
's
new
chariot
:
for
she
has
not
been
long
out
of
her
transitory
mourning
,
and
dressed
as
rich
as
jewels
,
and
a
profusion
of
expense
,
could
make
her
.
  
<EOS>
I
saw
them
from
the
window
alight
.
<EOS>
O
how
my
heart
throbbed
!
 
<EOS>
"
Lie
still
,
"
said
I
,
"
busy
thing
!
<EOS>
why
all
this
emotion
?
 
<EOS>
Those
shining
ornaments
cover
not
such
a
guileless
flatterer
as
thou
.
<EOS>
Why
then
all
this
emotion
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Polly
Barlow
came
up
instantly
from
Mr.
B.
  
I
hastened
down
;
tremble
,
tremble
,
tremble
,
went
my
feet
,
in
spite
of
all
the
resolution
I
had
been
endeavouring
so
long
to
collect
together
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
presented
the
countess
to
me
,
both
of
us
covered
with
blushes
;
but
from
very
different
motives
,
as
I
imagine
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
Countess
of
 
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
saluted
me
,
and
looked
,
as
I
thought
,
half
with
envy
,
half
with
shame
:
but
one
is
apt
to
form
people
's
countenances
by
what
one
judges
of
their
hearts
.
  
<EOS>
"
O
too
lovely
,
too
charming
rival
!
"
<EOS>
thought
<EOS>
I
 
<EOS>
"
Would
to
heaven
<EOS>
I
saw
less
attraction
in
you
!
"
 
<EOS>
For
indeed
she
is
a
charming
lady
;
yet
she
could
not
help
calling
me
Mrs.
B.
<EOS>
,
that
was
some
pride
to
me
:
every
little
distinction
is
a
pride
to
me
now
 
and
said
,
she
hoped
I
would
excuse
the
liberty
she
had
taken
:
<EOS>
but
the
character
given
of
me
by
Mr.
B.
made
her
desirous
of
paying
her
respects
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
O
these
villainous
masquerades
,
"
thought
I
!
 
<EOS>
"
You
would
never
have
wanted
to
see
me
,
but
for
them
,
poor
naughty
<EOS>
Nun
,
that
was
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
presented
also
the
Viscountess
to
me
;
I
saluted
her
ladyship
;
her
sister
saluted
me
.
  
<EOS>
She
is
a
graceful
lady
;
better
,
as
I
hope
,
in
heart
,
but
not
equal
in
person
to
her
sister
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
a
charming
boy
,
I
am
told
,
Madam
;
but
no
wonder
from
such
a
pair
!
"
  
"
<EOS>
O
dear
heart
<EOS>
,
"
thought
I
,
"
i'n't
it
so
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Your
ladyship
may
guess
what
I
thought
farther
.
  
<EOS>
"
Will
your
ladyship
see
him
now
?
"
said
Mr.
B.
  
He
did
not
look
down
;
no
,
not
one
bit
!
 
<EOS>
though
the
Countess
played
with
her
fan
,
and
looked
at
him
,
and
at
me
,
and
then
down
by
turns
,
a
little
consciously
:
while
I
wrapped
up
myself
in
my
innocence
,
my
first
flutters
being
over
,
and
thought
I
was
superior
,
by
reason
of
that
,
even
to
a
Countess
.
  
<EOS>
With
all
her
heart
,
she
said
.
  
<EOS>
I
rang
.
<EOS>
"
Polly
,
bid
nurse
bring
my
Billy
down
.
"
 
<EOS>
My
,
said
I
,
with
an
emphasis
.
  
<EOS>
I
met
the
nurse
at
the
stairs
'
foot
,
and
brought
in
my
dear
baby
in
my
arms
:
"
Such
a
child
,
and
such
a
mamma
!
"
said
the
Viscountess
.
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
give
Master
to
my
arms
,
one
moment
,
Madam
?
"
said
the
Countess
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
thought
I
,
"
much
rather
than
<EOS>
my
dear
naughty
gentleman
should
any
other
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
yielded
,
it
to
her
:
I
thought
she
would
have
stifled
it
with
her
warm
kisses
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Sweet
boy
I
charming
creature
,
"
and
pressed
it
to
her
too
lovely
bosom
,
with
such
emotion
,
looking
on
the
child
,
and
on
Mr.
B.
,
that
I
liked
it
not
by
any
means
.
  
<EOS>
"
Go
,
you
naughty
lady
,
"
thought
I
:
<EOS>
But
I
durst
not
say
so
.
"
<EOS>
And
go
,
naughty
man
,
too
!
"
<EOS>
thought
I
:
"
for
you
seem
to
look
too
much
gratified
in
your
pride
,
by
her
fondness
for
your
boy
.
<EOS>
I
wish
I
did
not
love
you
so
well
as
I
do
!
"
<EOS>
But
neither
,
your
ladyship
may
believe
,
did
I
say
this
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
looked
at
me
,
but
with
a
bravery
,
I
thought
,
too
like
what
I
had
been
witness
to
,
in
some
former
scenes
,
in
as
bad
a
cause
.
<EOS>
"
But
,
"
thought
I
,
"
God
delivered
me
then
;
I
will
confide
in
him
.
<EOS>
He
will
now
,
I
doubt
not
,
restore
thy
heart
to
my
prayers
;
untainted
,
I
hope
,
for
thy
own
dear
sake
as
well
as
mine
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
Viscountess
took
the
child
from
her
sister
,
and
kissed
him
with
great
pleasure
.
<EOS>
She
is
a
married
lady
.
<EOS>
Would
to
God
,
the
Countess
was
so
too
!
<EOS>
for
Mr.
B.
never
corresponded
,
as
I
told
your
ladyship
once
,
with
married
ladies
:
<EOS>
so
I
was
not
afraid
of
her
love
to
my
Billy
.
<EOS>
"
But
let
me
,
"
said
she
,
"
have
the
pleasure
of
restoring
Master
to
his
charming
mamma
.
<EOS>
I
thought
,
"
added
she
,
"
I
never
saw
a
lovelier
sight
in
my
life
,
than
when
in
his
mamma
's
arms
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
I
ca
n't
say
,
"
said
the
Countess
,
"
but
Master
and
his
mamma
do
credit
to
one
another
.
<EOS>
Dear
Madam
,
let
us
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
him
still
on
your
lap
,
while
he
is
so
good
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
wondered
the
dear
baby
was
so
quiet
;
though
,
indeed
,
he
is
generally
so
:
but
he
might
surely
,
if
but
by
sympathy
,
have
complained
for
his
poor
mamma
,
though
she
durst
not
for
herself
.
  
<EOS>
How
apt
one
is
to
engage
every
thing
in
one
's
distress
,
when
it
is
deep
!
<EOS>
and
one
wonders
too
,
that
things
animate
and
inanimate
look
with
the
same
face
,
when
we
are
greatly
moved
by
any
extraordinary
and
interesting
event
.
  
<EOS>
I
sat
down
with
my
baby
on
my
lap
,
looking
,
I
believe
,
with
a
righteous
boldness
<EOS>
(
I
will
call
it
so
;
for
well
says
the
text
,
"
The
righteous
is
as
bold
as
a
lion
,
"
)
<EOS>
now
on
my
Billy
,
now
on
his
papa
,
and
now
on
the
Countess
,
with
such
a
triumph
in
my
heart
;
for
I
saw
her
blush
,
and
look
down
,
and
the
dear
gentleman
seemed
to
eye
me
with
a
kind
of
conscious
tenderness
,
as
I
thought
.
  
<EOS>
A
silence
of
five
minutes
,
I
believe
,
succeeded
,
we
all
four
looking
upon
one
another
;
and
the
little
dear
was
awake
,
and
stared
full
upon
me
,
with
such
innocent
smiles
,
as
if
he
promised
to
love
me
,
and
make
me
amends
for
all
.
  
<EOS>
I
kissed
him
,
and
took
his
pretty
little
hand
in
mine
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
very
good
,
my
charmer
,
in
this
company
!
"
said
I.
  
I
remembered
a
scene
,
which
made
greatly
for
me
in
the
papers
you
have
seen
,
when
,
instead
of
recriminating
,
as
I
might
have
done
,
before
Mr.
Longman
for
harsh
usage
(
for
,
O
my
lady
,
your
dear
brother
has
a
hard
heart
indeed
when
he
pleases
)
,
I
only
prayed
for
him
on
my
knees
.
  
<EOS>
And
I
hope
I
was
not
now
too
mean
;
for
I
had
dignity
and
a
proud
superiority
in
my
vain
heart
,
over
them
all
.
<EOS>
Then
it
was
not
my
part
to
be
upon
defiances
,
where
I
loved
,
and
where
I
hoped
to
reclaim
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
what
had
I
done
by
that
,
but
justified
,
seemingly
,
by
after
acts
in
a
passionate
resentment
,
to
their
minds
,
at
least
,
their
too
wicked
treatment
of
me
?
 
<EOS>
Moreover
,
your
ladyship
will
remember
,
that
Mr.
B.
knew
not
that
I
was
acquainted
with
his
intrigue
:
for
I
must
call
it
so
.
<EOS>
If
he
had
,
he
is
too
noble
to
insult
me
by
such
a
visit
;
and
he
had
told
me
,
I
should
see
the
lady
he
was
at
Oxford
with
.
  
<EOS>
And
this
,
breaking
silence
,
he
mentioned
;
<EOS>
saying
,
"
I
gave
you
hope
,
my
dear
,
that
I
should
procure
you
the
honour
of
a
visit
from
a
lady
who
put
herself
under
my
care
at
Oxford
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
bowed
my
head
to
the
Countess
;
but
my
tears
being
ready
to
start
<EOS>
,
I
kissed
my
Billy
:
"
Dearest
baby
,
"
said
I
,
"
you
are
not
going
to
cry
,
are
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
I
would
have
had
him
just
then
to
cry
,
instead
of
me
.
  
<EOS>
The
tea
equipage
was
brought
in
.
"
<EOS>
Polly
,
carry
the
child
to
nurse
.
<EOS>
"
I
gave
it
another
kiss
,
and
the
Countess
desired
another
.
<EOS>
I
grudged
it
,
to
think
her
naughty
lips
should
so
closely
follow
mine
.
<EOS>
Her
sister
kissed
it
also
,
and
carried
him
to
Mr.
B.
<EOS>
"
Take
him
away
,
"
said
he
,
"
I
owe
him
my
blessing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
O
these
young
gentlemen
papas
!
"
said
the
Countess
 
<EOS>
"
They
are
like
young
unbroken
horses
,
just
put
into
the
traces
!
"
    
<EOS>
"
Are
they
so
?
"
<EOS>
thought
I.
"
Matrimony
must
not
expect
your
good
word
<EOS>
,
I
doubt
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
after
tea
,
at
which
I
was
far
from
being
talkative
(
for
I
could
not
tell
what
to
say
,
though
I
tried
,
as
much
as
I
could
not
to
appear
sullen
)
,
desired
the
Countess
to
play
one
tune
upon
the
harpsichord
.
 
<EOS>
She
did
,
and
sung
,
at
his
request
,
<EOS>
an
Italian
song
to
it
very
prettily
;
too
prettily
,
I
thought
.
<EOS>
I
wanted
to
find
some
faults
,
some
great
faults
in
her
:
but
,
O
Madam
,
she
has
too
many
outward
excellencies
!
 
<EOS>
pity
she
wants
a
good
heart
.
  
<EOS>
He
could
ask
nothing
,
that
she
was
not
ready
to
oblige
him
;
indeed
he
could
not
.
  
<EOS>
She
desired
me
to
touch
the
keys
.
<EOS>
I
would
have
been
excused
;
but
could
not
.
<EOS>
And
the
ladies
commended
my
performance
;
but
neither
my
heart
to
play
,
nor
my
fingers
in
playing
,
deserved
their
praises
.
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
said
,
indeed
 
"
You
play
better
sometimes
,
my
dear
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Do
I
,
Sir
?
"
was
all
the
answer
I
made
.
  
<EOS>
The
Countess
hoped
,
she
said
,
I
would
return
her
visit
;
and
so
said
the
Viscountess
.
  
<EOS>
I
replied
,
Mr.
B.
would
command
me
whenever
he
pleased
.
  
<EOS>
She
said
,
she
hoped
to
be
better
acquainted
(
"
I
hope
not
,
"
thought
I
)
 
<EOS>
and
that
I
would
give
her
my
company
,
for
a
week
or
so
,
upon
the
Forest
<EOS>
:
it
seems
she
has
a
seat
upon
Windsor
Forest
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
B.
says
,
"
added
she
,
"
you
ca
n't
ride
a
single
horse
;
but
we
'll
teach
you
there
.
'
<EOS>
Tis
a
sweet
place
for
that
purpose
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
came
Mr.
B.
,
"
thought
I
,
"
to
tell
you
that
,
Madam
?
<EOS>
I
suppose
you
know
more
of
me
than
I
do
myself
.
"
<EOS>
Indeed
,
my
lady
,
this
may
be
too
true
;
for
she
may
know
what
is
to
become
of
me
!
  
<EOS>
I
told
her
,
I
was
very
much
obliged
to
her
ladyship
;
and
that
Mr.
B.
directed
all
my
motions
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
say
you
,
Sir
?
"
said
the
Countess
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
promise
that
.
<EOS>
Madam
:
for
Mrs.
B.
wants
to
go
down
to
Kent
,
before
we
go
to
Bedfordshire
,
and
I
am
afraid
I
ca
n't
give
her
my
company
thither
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
,
Sir
,
I
sha
n't
choose
to
go
without
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
not
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
But
if
you
are
disposed
to
oblige
the
Countess
for
a
week
,
as
you
never
were
at
Windsor
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
,
Sir
,
"
interrupted
I
,
"
what
with
my
little
nursery
,
and
one
thing
or
another
,
I
must
deny
myself
that
honour
,
for
this
season
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Madam
,
then
I
'll
expect
you
in
Pall
Mall
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
bowed
my
head
,
and
said
,
Mr.
B.
would
command
me
.
  
<EOS>
They
took
leave
with
a
politeness
natural
to
them
.
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
,
as
he
handed
them
to
the
chariot
,
said
something
in
Italian
to
the
Countess
:
the
word
Pamela
was
in
what
he
said
:
<EOS>
she
answered
him
with
a
downcast
look
,
in
the
same
language
,
half
-
pleased
,
half
-
serious
,
and
the
chariot
drove
away
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
give
,
"
said
I
,
"
a
good
deal
,
<EOS>
Sir
,
to
know
what
her
ladyship
said
to
you
;
she
looked
with
so
particular
a
meaning
,
if
I
may
say
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
tell
you
,
truly
,
<EOS>
Pamela
:
I
said
to
her
,
"
Well
,
now
your
ladyship
has
seen
my
Pamela
 
Is
she
not
the
charmingest
girl
in
the
world
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
answered
"
Mrs.
B.
is
very
grave
,
for
so
young
a
lady
;
but
<EOS>
I
must
needs
say
she
is
a
lovely
creature
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
did
you
say
so
.
<EOS>
Sir
?
<EOS>
And
did
her
ladyship
so
answer
?
"
<EOS>
And
my
heart
was
ready
to
leap
out
of
my
bosom
for
joy
.
  
<EOS>
But
my
folly
spoiled
all
again
;
for
,
to
my
own
surprise
,
and
great
regret
,
I
burst
out
into
tears
;
though
I
even
sobbed
to
have
suppressed
them
,
but
could
not
;
and
so
I
lost
a
fine
opportunity
to
have
talked
to
him
while
he
was
so
kind
;
for
he
was
more
angry
with
me
than
ever
.
  
<EOS>
What
made
me
such
a
fool
,
I
wonder
?
<EOS>
But
I
had
so
long
struggled
with
myself
;
and
not
expecting
so
kind
a
question
from
the
dear
gentleman
,
or
such
a
favourable
answer
from
the
Countess
,
I
had
no
longer
any
command
of
myself
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
ails
the
little
fool
?
"
said
he
,
with
a
wrathful
countenance
.
<EOS>
This
made
me
worse
,
and
he
added
,
"
Take
care
,
take
care
,
Pamela
!
 
<EOS>
You
'll
drive
me
from
you
,
in
spite
of
my
own
heart
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
So
he
went
into
the
best
parlour
,
and
put
on
his
sword
,
and
took
his
hat
.
<EOS>
I
followed
him
 
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
Sir
!
<EOS>
"
with
my
arms
expanded
,
was
all
I
could
say
;
but
he
avoided
me
,
putting
on
his
hat
with
an
air
;
and
out
he
went
,
bidding
Abraham
follow
him
.
  
<EOS>
This
is
the
dilemma
into
which
,
as
I
hinted
at
the
beginning
of
this
letter
,
I
have
brought
myself
with
Mr.
B.
<EOS>
How
strong
,
how
prevalent
is
the
passion
of
jealousy
;
and
thus
it
will
shew
itself
uppermost
,
when
it
is
uppermost
,
in
spite
of
one
's
most
watchful
regards
!
  
<EOS>
My
mind
is
so
perplexed
,
that
I
must
lay
down
my
pen
:
and
,
indeed
,
your
ladyship
will
wonder
,
<EOS>
all
things
considered
,
that
I
could
write
the
above
account
as
I
have
done
,
in
this
cruel
suspense
,
and
with
such
apprehensions
.
<EOS>
But
writing
is
all
the
diversion
I
have
,
when
my
mind
is
oppressed
.
  
<EOS>
PAST
TEN
<EOS>
O'CLOCK
AT
NIGHT
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
only
time
to
tell
your
ladyship
(
for
the
postman
waits
)
that
Mr.
B.
is
just
come
in
.
<EOS>
He
is
gone
into
his
closet
,
and
has
shut
the
door
,
and
taken
the
key
on
the
inside
;
so
I
dare
not
go
to
him
there
.
<EOS>
In
this
uncertainty
and
suspense
,
pity
and
pray
for
your
ladyship
's
afflicted
sister
and
servant
,
  
P.B.
    
MY
DEAR
LADY
,
  
I
will
now
proceed
with
my
melancholy
account
.
<EOS>
Not
knowing
what
to
do
,
and
Mr.
B.
not
coming
near
me
,
and
the
clock
striking
twelve
,
I
ventured
to
send
this
billet
to
him
,
by
Polly
.
  
<EOS>
"
DEAR
SIR
,
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
you
choose
not
to
be
invaded
,
when
retired
to
your
closet
;
yet
,
being
very
uneasy
,
on
account
of
your
abrupt
departure
,
and
heavy
displeasure
,
I
take
the
liberty
to
write
these
few
lines
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
own
,
Sir
,
that
the
sudden
flow
of
tears
which
involuntarily
burst
from
me
,
at
your
kind
expressions
to
the
Countess
in
my
favour
,
when
I
had
thought
for
more
than
a
month
past
,
you
were
angry
with
me
,
and
which
had
distressed
my
weak
mind
beyond
expression
,
might
appear
unaccountable
to
you
.
<EOS>
But
had
you
kindly
waited
but
one
moment
till
this
fit
,
which
was
rather
owing
to
my
gratitude
than
to
perverseness
,
had
been
over
(
<EOS>
and
I
knew
the
time
when
you
would
have
generously
soothed
it
)
,
I
should
have
had
the
happiness
of
a
more
serene
and
favourable
parting
.
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
suffer
me
,
Sir
,
to
attend
you
?
<EOS>
(
Polly
shall
wait
your
answer
)
.
<EOS>
I
dare
not
come
without
your
permission
;
for
should
you
be
as
angry
as
you
were
<EOS>
,
I
know
not
how
I
shall
bear
it
.
<EOS>
But
if
you
say
I
may
come
down
,
I
hope
to
satisfy
you
,
that
I
intended
not
any
offence
.
<EOS>
Do
,
dear
Sir
,
permit
me
to
attend
you
<EOS>
,
I
can
say
no
more
,
<EOS>
than
that
I
am
your
ever
dutiful
,
  
"
P.B.
"
  
Polly
returned
with
the
following
.
"
<EOS>
So
,
"
thought
I
,
"
a
letter
!
 
<EOS>
I
could
have
spared
that
,
I
am
sure
.
<EOS>
"
I
expected
no
favour
from
it
.
<EOS>
So
tremblingly
,
opened
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
MY
DEAR
,
  
"
I
would
not
have
you
sit
up
for
me
.
<EOS>
We
are
getting
apace
into
the
matrimonial
recriminations
.
<EOS>
You
knew
the
time
!
 
<EOS>
So
did
I
,
my
dear
!
 
<EOS>
But
it
seems
that
the
time
is
over
with
both
;
and
I
have
had
the
mortification
,
for
some
past
weeks
,
to
come
home
to
a
very
different
Pamela
,
than
I
used
to
leave
all
company
and
all
pleasure
for
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
we
shall
better
understand
one
another
.
<EOS>
But
you
can
not
see
me
at
present
with
any
advantage
to
yourself
;
and
I
would
not
,
that
any
thing
farther
should
pass
,
to
add
to
the
regrets
of
both
.
<EOS>
I
wish
you
good
rest
.
<EOS>
I
will
give
your
cause
a
fair
hearing
,
when
I
am
more
fit
to
hear
all
your
pleas
,
and
your
excuses
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
be
insensible
,
that
the
reason
for
the
concern
you
have
lately
shewn
,
must
lie
deeper
than
,
perhaps
,
you
'll
now
own
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
you
are
prepared
to
speak
all
that
is
upon
your
mind
,
and
I
to
hear
it
with
temper
,
then
we
may
come
to
an
eclaircissement
.
<EOS>
Till
when
I
am
your
affectionate
,
&
c.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
My
busy
apprehension
immediately
suggested
to
me
,
that
I
was
to
be
terrified
,
with
a
high
hand
,
into
a
compliance
with
some
new
scheme
or
other
that
was
projecting
;
and
it
being
near
one
,
and
hearing
nothing
from
Mr.
B.
<EOS>
,
I
bid
Polly
<EOS>
go
to
bed
,
thinking
she
would
wonder
at
our
intercourse
by
letter
,
if
I
should
send
again
.
  
<EOS>
So
down
I
ventured
,
my
feet
,
however
,
trembling
all
the
way
,
and
tapped
at
the
door
of
his
closet
.
  
<EOS>
"
Who
's
that
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
,
Sir
:
one
word
,
if
you
please
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
be
more
angry
,
however
,
Sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
opened
the
door
:
"
Thus
poor
Hester
,
to
her
royal
husband
,
ventured
her
life
,
to
break
in
upon
him
unbidden
.
<EOS>
But
that
eastern
monarch
,
great
as
he
was
,
extended
to
the
fainting
suppliant
the
golden
sceptre
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
took
my
hand
:
"
I
hope
,
<EOS>
my
dear
,
by
this
tragedy
speech
,
we
are
not
to
expect
any
sad
catastrophe
to
our
present
misunderstanding
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
not
,
Sir
.
<EOS>
But
'
tis
all
as
God
and
you
shall
please
.
<EOS>
I
am
resolved
to
do
my
duty
,
Sir
,
if
possible
.
<EOS>
But
,
indeed
,
I
can
not
bear
this
cruel
suspense
!
<EOS>
Let
me
know
what
is
to
become
of
me
.
<EOS>
Let
me
know
<EOS>
but
what
is
designed
for
me
,
and
you
shall
be
sure
of
all
the
acquiescence
that
my
duty
and
conscience
can
give
to
your
pleasure
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
means
the
dear
creature
?
<EOS>
What
means
my
Pamela
?
<EOS>
Surely
,
your
head
,
child
,
is
a
little
affected
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
tell
,
Sir
,
but
it
may
!
 
<EOS>
But
let
me
have
my
trial
,
that
you
write
about
.
<EOS>
Appoint
my
day
of
hearing
,
and
speedily
too
;
for
I
would
not
bear
such
another
month
,
as
the
last
has
been
,
for
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Come
,
my
dear
,
"
said
he
,
"
let
me
attend
you
to
your
chamber
.
<EOS>
But
your
mind
has
taken
much
too
solemn
a
turn
,
to
enter
further
now
upon
this
subject
.
<EOS>
Think
as
well
of
me
as
I
do
of
you
,
and
I
shall
be
as
happy
as
ever
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
wept
,
"
Be
not
angry
,
dear
Sir
:
<EOS>
your
kind
words
have
just
the
same
effect
upon
me
now
,
as
in
the
afternoon
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Your
apprehensions
,
my
dear
,
must
be
very
strong
,
that
a
kind
word
,
as
you
call
it
,
has
such
an
effect
upon
you
!
<EOS>
But
let
us
wave
the
subject
for
a
few
days
,
because
I
am
to
set
out
on
a
little
journey
at
four
,
and
had
not
intended
to
go
to
bed
,
for
so
few
hours
.
"
  
<EOS>
When
we
came
up
,
I
said
,
"
I
was
very
bold
.
<EOS>
Sir
,
to
break
in
upon
you
;
but
I
could
not
help
it
,
if
my
life
had
been
the
forfeit
;
and
you
received
me
with
more
goodness
than
I
could
have
expected
.
<EOS>
But
will
you
pardon
me
,
if
I
ask
,
whither
you
go
so
soon
?
<EOS>
And
if
you
had
intended
to
have
gone
without
taking
leave
of
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
go
to
Tunbridge
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
stept
up
and
taken
leave
of
you
before
I
went
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Sir
,
I
will
not
ask
you
,
who
is
of
your
party
:
I
will
not
 
No
,
"
(
putting
my
hand
to
his
lips
)
"
do
n't
tell
me
.
<EOS>
Sir
:
it
may
n't
be
proper
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
fear
,
my
dear
;
I
wo
n't
tell
you
:
nor
am
I
certain
whether
it
be
proper
or
not
,
till
we
are
come
to
a
better
understanding
.
<EOS>
Only
,
once
more
,
think
as
well
of
me
as
I
do
of
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Would
to
Heaven
,
"
thought
I
,
"
there
was
the
same
reason
for
the
one
as
for
the
other
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
intended
(
for
my
heart
was
full
)
to
enter
further
into
this
subject
,
so
fatal
to
my
repose
:
but
the
dear
gentleman
had
no
sooner
laid
his
head
on
the
pillow
,
but
he
fell
asleep
,
or
feigned
to
do
so
,
and
that
was
as
prohibitory
to
my
talking
as
if
he
had
.
<EOS>
So
I
had
all
my
own
entertaining
reflections
to
myself
;
which
gave
me
not
one
wink
of
sleep
;
but
made
me
of
so
much
service
,
as
to
tell
him
,
when
the
clock
struck
four
,
that
he
should
not
(
though
I
did
not
say
so
<EOS>
,
you
may
think
,
Madam
)
make
my
ready
rivaless
(
for
I
doubted
not
her
being
one
of
the
party
)
wait
for
him
.
  
<EOS>
He
arose
,
and
was
dressed
instantly
;
and
saluting
me
,
bid
me
be
easy
and
happy
,
while
it
was
yet
in
my
own
power
.
  
<EOS>
He
said
,
he
should
be
back
on
Saturday
night
,
as
he
believed
.
<EOS>
And
I
wished
him
,
most
fervently
,
I
am
sure
,
health
,
pleasure
,
and
safety
.
  
<EOS>
Here
,
Madam
,
must
I
end
this
letter
.
<EOS>
My
next
,
will
,
perhaps
contain
my
trial
,
and
my
sentence
:
<EOS>
God
give
me
but
patience
and
resignation
,
and
then
whatever
occurs
,
I
shall
not
be
unhappy
:
especially
while
I
can
have
,
in
the
last
resource
,
the
pleasure
of
calling
myself
your
ladyship
's
most
obliged
sister
and
servant

Lady

I
will
be
preparing
to
write
to
you
,
as
I
have
opportunity
,
not
doubting
<EOS>
but
this
must
be
a
long
letter
;

having
some
apprehensions

that

as
things
may
fall
out
,
I
may
want
either
head

heart
to
write

Wednesday
morninge

"
9
o'clock

"
  
<EOS>
Just
above
I
called
my
state
,
a
state
of
cruel
suspense
.
<EOS>
But
I
recall
the
words
<EOS>
:
for
now
it
is
no
longer
suspense
;
since
,
if
this
letter
says
truth
,
I
know
the
worst
:
and
there
is
too
much
appearance
that
it
does
,
let
the
writer
be
who
he
will
,
or
his
or
her
motive
what
it
will
:
for
,
after
all
,
I
am
apt
to
fancy
this
a
contrivance
of
Mr.
Turner
's
,
though
,
for
fear
of
ill
consequences
,
I
will
not
say
so
.
  
<EOS>
And
now
,
Madam
,
I
am
endeavouring
,
by
the
help
of
religion
,
and
<EOS>
cool
reflection
,
to
bring
my
mind
to
bear
this
heavy
evil
,
and
to
recollect
what
I
was
,
and
how
much
more
honourable
an
estate
I
am
in
,
than
I
could
ever
have
expected
to
be
in
;
that
my
virtue
and
good
name
are
secured
;
and
I
can
return
innocent
to
my
dear
parents
:
and
these
were
once
the
only
pride
of
my
heart
.
  
<EOS>
In
addition
to
what
I
was
then
(
and
yet
I
pleased
myself
with
my
prospects
,
poor
as
they
were
)
,
I
have
honest
parents
,
bountifully
provided
for
,
thank
God
and
your
ever
-
dear
brother
for
this
blessing
!
 
<EOS>
and
not
only
provided
for
 
but
made
useful
to
him
,
to
the
amount
of
their
provision
,
well
-
nigh
!
<EOS>
There
is
a
pride
,
my
lady
!
  
<EOS>
Then
I
shall
have
better
conditions
from
his
generosity
to
support
myself
,
than
I
can
wish
for
,
or
make
use
of
.
  
<EOS>
Then
I
have
my
dear
Billy
-
O
be
contented
,
<EOS>
too
charming
,
and
too
happy
rival
,
with
my
husband
;
and
tear
not
from
me
<EOS>
my
dearest
baby
,
the
pledge
,
the
beloved
pledge
,
of
our
happier
affections
,
and
the
dear
remembrance
of
what
I
once
was
!
 
<EOS>
A
thousand
pleasing
prospects
,
that
had
begun
to
dawn
on
my
mind
,
I
can
bear
to
have
dissipated
!
<EOS>
But
I
can
not
,
indeed
I
can
not
!
<EOS>
permit
my
dear
Mr.
B.
's
son
and
heir
to
be
torn
from
me
.
  
<EOS>
But
I
am
running
on
in
a
strain
that
shews
my
impatience
,
rather
than
my
resignation
;
yet
some
struggles
must
be
allowed
me
:
I
could
not
have
loved
,
as
I
love
,
if
I
could
easily
part
with
my
interest
in
so
beloved
a
husband
.
 
<EOS>
For
my
interest
I
will
part
with
,
and
sooner
die
,
than
live
with
a
gentleman
who
has
another
wife
,
though
I
was
the
first
.
<EOS>
Let
countesses
,
if
they
can
,
and
ladies
of
birth
,
choose
to
humble
themselves
to
this
baseness
.
<EOS>
The
low
-
born
Pamela
can
not
stoop
to
it
.
<EOS>
Pardon
me
;
you
know
I
only
write
this
with
a
view
to
this
poor
lady
's
answer
to
her
noble
uncle
,
of
which
you
wrote
me
word

FRIDAY
  
Is
now
concluding
.
<EOS>
I
hope
I
am
much
calmer
.
<EOS>
For
,
being
disappointed
,
in
all
likelihood
,
in
twenty
agreeable
schemes
and
projects
,
I
am
now
forming
new
ones
,
with
as
much
pleasure
to
myself
as
I
may
.
  
<EOS>
I
am
thinking
to
try
to
get
good
Mrs.
Jervis
with
me
.
<EOS>
You
must
not
,
Madam
,
be
too
much
concerned
for
me
.
<EOS>
After
a
while
,
I
shall
be
no
unhappy
person
;
for
though
I
was
thankful
for
my
splendid
fortunes
,
and
should
have
been
glad
,
to
be
sure
I
should
,
of
continuing
in
them
,
with
so
dear
a
gentleman
;
yet
a
high
estate
had
never
such
dazzling
charms
with
me
as
it
has
with
some
:
if
it
had
,
I
could
not
have
resisted
so
many
temptations
,
possibly
,
as
God
enabled
me
to
resist
.
  
<EOS>
SATURDAY
NIGHT
  
<EOS>
Is
now
come
.
'
<EOS>
Tis
nine
,
and
no
Mr.
B.
 
<EOS>
"
O
why
,
"
as
Deborah
makes
the
mother
of
Sisera
say
,
"
is
his
chariot
so
long
in
coming
?
<EOS>
Why
tarry
the
wheels
of
his
chariot
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
have
this
note
now
at
eleven
o'clock
:
  
"
<EOS>
MY
DEAREST
PAMELA
,
  
<EOS>
"
I
dispatch
the
messenger
,
lest
,
expecting
me
this
night
,
you
should
be
uneasy
.
<EOS>
I
shall
not
be
with
you
till
Monday
,
when
I
hope
to
dine
with
my
dearest
life
.
<EOS>
Ever
affectionately
yours
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
So
I
'll
go
up
and
pray
for
him
,
and
then
to
bed
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
'
tis
a
sad
thing
!
 
<EOS>
I
have
had
but
poor
rest
for
a
great
while
;
nor
shall
have
any
till
my
fate
is
decided
.
 
<EOS>
Hard
-
hearted
man
<EOS>
,
he
knows
under
what
uneasiness
he
left
me
!
  
<EOS>
MONDAY
,
ELEVEN
.
  
<EOS>
If
God
Almighty
hears
my
yesterday
's
,
and
indeed
my
hourly
,
prayers
,
the
dear
man
will
be
good
still
;
but
my
aching
heart
,
every
time
I
think
what
company
he
is
in
(
for
I
find
the
Countess
is
certainly
one
of
the
party
)
,
bodes
me
little
satisfaction
.
  
<EOS>
He
's
come
!
<EOS>
He
's
come
!
<EOS>
now
,
just
now
,
come
!
<EOS>
I
will
have
my
trial
over
before
this
night
be
past
,
if
possible
.
<EOS>
I
'll
go
down
and
meet
him
with
love
unfeigned
,
and
a
duty
equal
to
my
love
,
although
he
may
forget
his
to
me
.
<EOS>
If
I
conquer
myself
on
this
occasion
,
I
conquer
nature
,
as
your
ladyship
says
:
and
then
,
by
God
's
grace
,
I
can
conquer
every
thing
.
<EOS>
They
have
taken
their
house
,
I
suppose
:
but
what
need
they
,
when
they
'll
have
one
in
Bedfordshire
,
and
one
in
Lincolnshire
?
<EOS>
But
they
know
best
.
<EOS>
God
bless
him
,
and
reform
her
!
<EOS>
That
's
all
the
harm
I
wish
them
,
or
will
wish
them
!
  
<EOS>
My
dear
Mr.
B.
has
received
me
with
great
affection
and
tenderness
.
<EOS>
Sure
he
can
not
be
so
bad
!
 
<EOS>
Sure
he
can
not
!
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
,
my
dear
,
"
said
he
,
"
I
left
you
in
great
anxiety
;
but
'
tis
an
anxiety
you
have
brought
upon
yourself
;
and
I
have
not
been
easy
ever
since
I
parted
from
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
for
it
,
Sir
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
my
dear
love
,
there
is
still
a
melancholy
air
in
your
countenance
:
indeed
,
it
seems
mingled
with
a
kind
of
joy
;
I
hope
at
my
return
to
you
.
<EOS>
But
'
tis
easy
to
see
which
of
the
two
is
the
most
natural
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
should
see
nothing
.
<EOS>
Sir
,
that
you
would
not
wish
to
see
,
if
I
could
help
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
you
can
not
.
<EOS>
But
I
am
come
home
to
hear
all
your
grievances
,
and
to
redress
them
,
if
in
my
power
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
When
,
Sir
,
am
I
to
come
upon
my
trial
?
<EOS>
I
have
much
to
say
.
<EOS>
I
will
tell
you
everything
I
think
.
<EOS>
And
,
as
it
may
be
the
last
grievances
,
as
you
are
pleased
to
call
them
,
I
may
ever
trouble
you
with
<EOS>
,
you
must
promise
to
answer
me
not
one
word
till
I
have
done
.
<EOS>
For
,
if
it
does
but
hold
,
I
have
great
courage
,
indeed
I
you
do
n't
know
half
the
sauciness
that
is
in
your
girl
yet
;
but
when
I
come
upon
my
trial
,
you
'll
wonder
at
my
boldness
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
means
my
dearest
?
"
taking
me
into
his
arms
.
<EOS>
"
You
alarm
me
exceedingly
,
by
this
moving
sedateness
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
n't
let
it
alarm
you
.
<EOS>
Sir
!
<EOS>
I
mean
nothing
but
good
!
 
<EOS>
But
I
have
been
preparing
myself
to
tell
you
all
my
mind
.
<EOS>
And
as
an
instance
of
what
you
may
expect
from
me
,
sometimes
,
Sir
,
I
will
be
your
judge
,
and
put
home
questions
to
you
;
and
sometimes
you
shall
be
mine
,
and
at
last
pronounce
sentence
upon
me
;
or
,
if
you
wo
n't
,
I
will
upon
myself
;
a
severe
one
to
me
,
it
shall
be
,
but
an
agreeable
one
,
perhaps
,
to
you
!
 
<EOS>
When
comes
on
the
trial
.
<EOS>
Sir
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
looked
steadily
upon
me
,
but
was
silent
.
<EOS>
And
I
said
,
"
But
do
n't
be
afraid
,
Sir
,
that
I
will
invade
your
province
;
for
though
I
shall
count
myself
your
judge
,
in
some
cases
,
you
shall
be
judge
paramount
still
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
charmer
of
my
heart
,
"
said
he
,
and
clasped
me
to
his
bosom
,
"
what
a
new
PAMELA
have
I
in
my
arms
!
<EOS>
A
mysterious
charmer
!
<EOS>
Let
us
instantly
go
to
my
closet
,
or
yours
,
and
come
upon
our
mutual
trial
;
for
you
have
fired
my
soul
with
impatience
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
Sir
,
if
you
please
,
we
will
dine
first
.
<EOS>
I
have
hardly
eaten
any
thing
these
four
days
;
and
your
company
may
give
me
an
appetite
.
<EOS>
I
shall
be
pleased
to
sit
down
at
table
with
you
.
<EOS>
Sir
,
"
taking
his
hand
,
and
trying
to
smile
upon
him
;
"
for
the
moments
I
have
of
your
company
,
may
be
,
some
time
hence
,
very
precious
to
my
remembrance
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
was
then
forced
to
turn
my
head
,
to
hide
from
him
my
eyes
,
brimful
as
they
were
of
tears
.
  
<EOS>
He
took
me
again
into
his
arms
:
 
<EOS>
"
My
dearest
Pamela
,
if
you
love
me
,
distract
not
my
soul
thus
,
by
your
dark
and
mysterious
speeches
.
<EOS>
You
are
displeased
with
me
,
and
I
thought
I
had
reason
,
of
late
,
to
take
something
amiss
in
your
conduct
;
but
,
instead
of
your
suffering
by
my
anger
,
you
have
words
and
an
air
that
penetrate
my
very
soul
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
O
Sir
,
Sir
,
treat
me
not
thus
kindly
!
<EOS>
Put
on
an
angrier
brow
,
or
how
shall
I
retain
my
purpose
?
<EOS>
How
shall
I
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
,
dear
creature
!
<EOS>
make
not
use
of
all
your
power
to
melt
me
!
<EOS>
Half
of
it
is
enough
.
<EOS>
For
there
is
eloquence
in
your
eyes
I
can
not
resist
;
but
in
your
present
solemn
air
,
and
affecting
sentences
,
you
mould
me
to
every
purpose
of
your
heart
;
so
that
I
am
a
mere
machine
,
a
passive
instrument
,
to
be
played
upon
at
your
pleasure
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
,
kind
Sir
,
how
you
revive
my
heart
,
by
your
goodness
!
<EOS>
Perhaps
I
have
only
been
in
a
frightful
dream
,
and
am
but
just
now
awakened
.
 
<EOS>
But
we
will
not
anticipate
our
trial
.
<EOS>
Only
,
Sir
,
give
orders
,
that
you
are
not
to
be
spoken
with
by
any
body
,
when
we
have
dined
;
for
I
must
have
you
all
to
myself
,
without
interruption
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Just
as
I
had
said
this
,
a
gentleman
calling
<EOS>
,
I
retired
to
my
chamber
,
and
wrote
to
this
place
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
dismissed
his
friend
,
without
asking
him
to
dine
;
so
I
had
him
all
to
myself
at
dinner
 
<EOS>
But
we
said
little
,
and
sat
not
above
a
quarter
of
an
hour
;
looking
at
each
other
:
he
,
with
impatience
,
and
some
seeming
uneasiness
;
I
with
more
steadiness
,
I
believe
,
but
now
and
then
a
tear
starting
.
  
<EOS>
I
eat
but
little
,
though
I
tried
all
I
could
,
and
especially
as
he
helped
me
,
and
courted
me
with
tenderness
and
sweetness
 
<EOS>
O
why
were
ever
such
things
as
masquerades
permitted
in
a
Christian
nation
!
  
<EOS>
I
chose
to
go
into
my
closet
rather
than
into
his
;
and
here
I
sit
,
waiting
the
dear
gentleman
's
coming
up
to
me
.
<EOS>
If
I
keep
but
<EOS>
my
courage
,
I
shall
be
pleased
.
<EOS>
I
know
the
worst
,
and
that
will
help
me
;
for
he
is
too
noble
to
use
me
roughly
,
<EOS>
when
he
sees
I
mean
not
to
provoke
him
by
upbraidings
,
any
more
than
I
will
act
,
in
this
case
,
beneath
the
character
I
ought
to
assume
as
his
wife
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
came
up
,
with
great
impatience
in
his
looks
.
<EOS>
I
met
him
at
the
chamber
door
,
with
a
very
sedate
countenance
,
and
my
heart
was
high
with
my
purpose
,
and
supported
me
better
than
I
could
have
expected
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
,
on
recollection
,
now
I
impute
to
myself
something
of
that
kind
of
magnanimity
,
<EOS>
that
was
wo
nt
to
inspire
the
innocent
sufferers
of
old
,
for
a
still
worthier
cause
than
mine
;
though
their
motives
could
hardly
be
more
pure
,
in
that
one
hope
I
had
,
to
be
an
humble
means
of
saving
the
man
I
love
and
honour
,
from
errors
that
might
be
fatal
to
his
soul
.
  
<EOS>
I
took
his
hand
with
boldness
:
 
"
Dear
Sir
,
"
leading
him
to
my
closet
,
"
here
is
the
bar
at
which
I
am
to
take
my
trial
,
"
pointing
to
the
backs
of
three
chairs
,
which
I
had
placed
in
a
joined
row
,
leaving
just
room
to
go
by
on
each
side
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
give
me
,
Sir
,
all
my
own
way
;
this
is
the
first
,
and
perhaps
the
last
time
,
that
I
shall
desire
it
.
 
<EOS>
Nay
,
dear
Sir
,
"
turning
my
face
from
him
,
"
look
not
upon
me
with
an
eye
of
tenderness
:
if
you
do
I
may
lose
my
purposes
,
important
to
me
as
they
are
;
and
however
fantastic
my
behaviour
may
seem
to
you
,
I
want
not
to
move
your
passions
(
for
the
good
impressions
made
upon
them
may
be
too
easily
dissipated
by
the
winds
of
sense
,
)
but
your
reason
;
and
if
that
can
be
done
,
I
am
safe
,
and
shall
fear
no
relapse
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
means
all
this
parade
,
my
dear
?
<EOS>
Let
me
perish
,
"
that
was
his
word
,
"
if
I
know
how
to
account
for
you
,
or
your
humour
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
,
presently
.
<EOS>
Sir
.
<EOS>
But
give
me
all
my
ways
 
<EOS>
I
pray
you
do
 
<EOS>
This
one
time
only
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
so
,
this
is
your
bar
,
is
it
?
<EOS>
There
's
an
elbow
-
chair
,
I
see
;
take
your
place
in
it
,
Pamela
,
and
here
I
'll
stand
to
answer
all
your
questions
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
Sir
,
that
must
not
be
.
"
<EOS>
So
I
boldly
led
him
to
the
elbow
-
chair
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
the
judge
,
Sir
;
it
is
I
that
am
to
be
tried
.
<EOS>
Yet
I
will
not
say
I
am
a
criminal
.
<EOS>
I
know
I
am
not
.
<EOS>
But
that
must
be
proved
,
Sir
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
take
your
way
;
but
I
fear
for
your
head
,
my
dear
,
in
all
this
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
fear
only
my
heart
,
Sir
,
that
's
all
!
<EOS>
but
there
you
must
sit
 
<EOS>
So
here
,
"
(
retiring
to
the
three
chairs
,
and
leaning
on
the
backs
,
)
"
here
I
stand
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
now
,
my
dearest
Mr.
B.
,
you
must
begin
first
;
you
must
be
my
accuser
,
as
well
as
my
judge
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
nothing
to
accuse
you
of
,
<EOS>
my
dear
,
if
I
must
give
in
to
your
moving
whimsy
.
<EOS>
You
are
everything
I
wish
you
to
be
.
<EOS>
But
for
the
last
month
you
have
seemed
to
be
uneasy
,
and
have
not
done
me
the
justice
to
acquaint
me
with
your
reasons
for
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
in
hopes
my
reasons
might
have
proved
to
be
no
reasons
;
and
I
would
not
trouble
you
with
my
ungrounded
apprehensions
.
<EOS>
But
now
,
Sir
,
we
are
come
directly
to
the
point
;
and
methinks
<EOS>
I
stand
here
as
Paul
did
before
Felix
;
and
like
that
poor
prisoner
,
if
I
,
Sir
,
reason
of
righteousness
,
temperance
,
and
judgment
to
come
,
even
to
make
you
,
as
the
great
Felix
did
,
tremble
,
do
n't
put
me
off
to
another
day
,
to
a
more
convenient
season
,
as
that
governor
did
Paul
;
for
you
must
bear
patiently
with
all
that
I
have

Strange
,
uncommon
girl
I
how
unaccountable
is
all
this
!
 
<EOS>
Pr'ythee
,
my
dear
,
"
and
he
pulled
a
chair
by
him
,
"
come
and
sit
down
by
me
,
and
without
these
romantic
airs
let
me
hear
all
you
have
to
say
;
and
teaze
me
not
with
this
parade
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
No
,
Sir
,
let
me
stand
,
if
you
please
,
while
I
can
stand
;
when
weary
I
will
sit
down
at
my
bar
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
Sir
,
since
you
are
so
good
as
to
say
,
you
have
nothing
but
change
of
temper
to
accuse
me
of
,
I
am
to
answer
to
that
,
and
assign
a
cause
;
and
I
will
do
it
without
evasion
or
reserve
;
but
I
beseech
you
say
<EOS>
not
one
word
<EOS>
but
Yes
or
No
,
to
my
questions
,
till
I
have
said
all
I
have
to
say
,
and
then
you
shall
find
me
all
silence
and
resignation
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
my
strange
dear
!
 
<EOS>
But
sure
your
head
is
a
little
turned
!
 
<EOS>
What
is
your
question
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Whether
,
Sir
,
the
Nun
 
I
speak
boldly
;
the
cause
requires
it
 
who
followed
you
at
the
Masquerade
every
where
,
is
not
the
Countess
of
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
then
,
my
dear
:
"
(
speaking
with
quickness
,
)
 
<EOS>
"
I
thought
the
occasion
of
your
sullenness
and
reserve
was
this
!
 
<EOS>
But
,
Pamela
"
  
"
Nay
,
Sir
,
"
interrupted
I
,
"
<EOS>
only
Yes
,
<EOS>
or
No
,
if
you
please
:
I
will
be
all
silence
by
-
and
-
by
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
then
.
"
 
"
Well
,
Sir
,
then
let
me
tell
you
,
for
I
ask
you
not
(
it
may
be
too
bold
in
me
to
multiply
questions
,
)
<EOS>
that
she
loves
you
;
that
you
correspond
by
letters
with
her
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
Sir
,
before
that
letter
from
her
ladyship
came
,
which
you
received
from
my
hand
in
so
short
and
angry
a
manner
,
for
fear
of
my
curiosity
to
see
its
contents
,
which
would
have
been
inexcusable
in
me
<EOS>
,
I
own
,
if
I
had
.
<EOS>
You
have
talked
over
to
her
all
your
polygamy
notions
,
and
she
seems
so
well
convinced
of
them
,
as
to
declare
to
her
noble
uncle
(
who
expostulated
with
her
on
the
occasions
she
gave
for
talk
,
)
that
she
had
rather
be
a
certain
gentleman
's
second
wife
,
than
the
first
to
the
greatest
man
in
England
:
and
you
are
but
just
returned
from
a
journey
to
Tunbridge
,
in
which
that
lady
was
a
party
;
and
the
motive
for
it
,
I
am
acquainted
with
,
by
this
letter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
was
displeased
,
and
frowned
:
I
looked
down
,
being
resolved
not
to
be
terrified
,
if
I
could
help
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
cautioned
you
,
Pamela
"
  
"
I
know
you
have
,
Sir
,
"
interrupted
I
;
"
but
be
pleased
to
answer
me
.
<EOS>
Has
not
the
Countess
taken
a
house
or
lodgings
at
Tunbridge
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
has
;
and
what
then
?
"
  
"
And
is
her
ladyship
there
,
or
in
town
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
 
and
what
then
?
"
  
"
Are
you
to
go
to
Tunbridge
,
Sir
,
soon
,
or
not
?
 
Be
pleased
to
answer
but
that
one
question
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
know
,
"
rising
up
in
anger
,
"
your
informants
,
Pamela
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
Sir
,
so
you
shall
,
in
proper
time
:
you
shall
know
all
,
when
I
am
convinced
,
that
your
wrath
will
not
be
attended
with
bad
consequences
to
yourself
and
others
.
<EOS>
That
is
wholly
the
cause
of
my
reserve
in
this
point
;
for
I
have
not
had
a
thought
,
since
I
have
been
yours
,
that
I
wished
to
be
concealed
from
you
.
 
<EOS>
But
your
knowledge
of
the
informants
makes
nothing
at
all
as
to
the
truth
of
the
information
 
<EOS>
Nor
will
I
press
you
too
home
.
<EOS>
I
doubt
not
,
you
are
soon
to
return
to
Tunbridge
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
,
and
what
then
?
 
<EOS>
Must
the
consequence
be
crime
enough
to
warrant
your
jealousy
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
Sir
,
do
n't
be
so
angry
,
"
still
looking
down
;
for
I
durst
not
trust
myself
to
look
up
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
do
this
,
as
your
letter
charged
me
,
in
a
spirit
of
matrimonial
recrimination
:
if
you
do
n't
tell
me
,
that
you
see
the
Countess
with
pleasure
,
I
ask
it
not
of
you
;
nor
have
I
anything
to
say
by
way
of
upbraiding
.
'
<EOS>
Tis
<EOS>
my
misfortune
,
that
she
is
too
lovely
,
and
too
attractive
:
and
<EOS>
it
is
the
less
wonder
,
that
a
fine
young
gentleman
as
you
are
,
and
a
fine
young
lady
as
she
is
,
should
engage
one
another
's
affections
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
knew
every
thing
,
except
what
this
letter
which
you
shall
read
presently
,
communicates
,
when
you
brought
the
two
noble
sisters
to
visit
me
:
hence
proceeded
my
grief
;
and
should
I
,
Sir
,
have
deserved
to
be
what
I
am
,
if
I
was
not
grieved
?
<EOS>
Religion
has
helped
me
,
and
God
has
answered
my
supplications
,
and
enabled
me
to
act
this
new
uncommon
part
before
you
at
this
imaginary
bar
.
<EOS>
You
shall
see
,
Sir
,
that
as
,
on
one
hand
,
I
want
not
,
as
I
said
before
,
to
move
your
passions
in
my
favour
;
so
,
on
the
other
,
I
shall
not
be
terrified
by
your
displeasure
,
dreaded
by
me
as
it
used
to
be
,
and
as
it
will
be
again
,
the
moment
that
my
raised
spirits
sink
down
to
their
usual
level
,
or
are
diverted
from
this
my
long
meditated
purpose
,
to
tell
you
all
my
mind
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
repeat
,
then
,
Sir
,
that
I
knew
all
this
,
when
the
two
noble
sisters
came
to
visit
your
poor
girl
,
and
to
see
your
Billy
.
<EOS>
Yet
,
grave
as
the
Countess
called
me
,
(
dear
Sir
!
<EOS>
might
I
not
well
be
grave
,
knowing
what
I
knew
?
)
<EOS>
did
I
betray
any
impatience
of
speech
or
action
,
or
any
discomposure
?
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
Sir
,
"
putting
my
hand
on
my
breast
,
"
here
all
my
discomposure
lay
,
vehemently
struggling
,
now
and
then
,
and
wanting
that
vent
of
my
eyes
,
which
it
seems
(
overcome
by
my
joy
,
to
hear
myself
favourably
spoken
of
by
you
and
the
lady
,
)
<EOS>
it
too
soon
made
itself
.
<EOS>
But
I
could
not
help
it
 
<EOS>
You
might
have
seen
.
<EOS>
Sir
,
I
could
not
!
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
want
neither
to
recriminate
nor
expostulate
;
nor
yet
,
Sir
,
to
form
excuses
for
my
general
conduct
;
for
that
you
accuse
not
in
the
main
 
but
be
pleased
,
Sir
,
to
read
this
letter
.
<EOS>
It
was
brought
by
the
penny
-
post
,
as
you
'll
see
by
the
mark
.
<EOS>
Who
the
writer
is
,
I
know
not
.
<EOS>
And
did
you
,
Sir
,
that
knowledge
,
and
your
resentment
upon
it
,
will
not
alter
the
fact
,
or
give
it
a
more
favourable
appearance
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
stepped
to
him
,
and
giving
him
the
letter
,
came
back
to
my
bar
,
and
sat
down
on
one
of
the
chairs
while
he
read
it
,
drying
my
eyes
;
for
they
would
overflow
as
I
talked
,
do
what
I
could
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
much
moved
at
the
contents
of
this
letter
;
called
it
malice
,
and
hoped
he
might
find
out
the
author
of
it
,
saying
,
he
would
advertise
500
guineas
reward
for
the
discoverer
.
  
<EOS>
He
put
the
letter
in
his
pocket
,
"
<EOS>
Well
,
Pamela
,
you
believe
all
you
have
said
,
no
doubt
:
and
this
matter
has
a
black
appearance
,
indeed
,
if
you
do
.
<EOS>
But
who
was
your
first
informant
?
 
<EOS>
Was
that
by
letter
or
personally
?
<EOS>
That
Turner
<EOS>
,
I
doubt
not
,
is
at
the
bottom
of
all
this
.
<EOS>
The
vain
coxcomb
has
had
the
insolence
to
imagine
the
Countess
would
favour
an
address
of
his
;
and
is
enraged
to
meet
with
a
repulse
;
and
has
taken
liberties
upon
it
,
that
have
given
birth
to
all
the
scandals
scattered
about
on
this
occasion
.
<EOS>
Nor
do
I
doubt
<EOS>
but
he
has
been
the
Serpent
at
the
ear
of
my
Eve
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
stood
up
at
the
bar
,
and
said
,
"
Do
n't
be
too
hasty
,
Sir
,
in
your
judgment
 
You
may
be
mistaken
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
am
I
mistaken
,
Pamela
?
 
<EOS>
You
never
told
me
an
untruth
in
cases
the
most
important
to
you
to
conceal
.
<EOS>
Am
I
mistaken
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
Sir
,
if
I
should
tell
you
it
is
not
Mr.
Turner
,
you
'll
guess
at
somebody
else
:
and
what
avails
all
this
to
the
matter
in
hand
?
<EOS>
You
are
your
own
master
,
and
must
stand
or
fall
by
your
own
conscience
.
<EOS>
God
grant
that
that
may
acquit
you
!
 
<EOS>
But
my
intention
is
not
either
to
accuse
or
upbraid
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
my
dear
,
to
the
fact
then
:
 
This
is
a
malicious
and
a
villainous
piece
of
intelligence
,
given
you
,
perhaps
,
for
the
sake
of
designs
and
views
,
that
may
not
yet
be
proper
to
be
avowed
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
By
God
's
grace
,
Sir
,
I
defy
all
designs
and
views
of
any
one
,
upon
my
honour
!
"
  
"
<EOS>
But
,
my
dear
,
the
charge
is
basely
false
:
we
have
not
agreed
upon
any
such
way
of
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Sir
,
all
this
only
proves
,
that
the
intelligence
may
be
a
little
premature
.
<EOS>
But
now
let
me
,
Sir
,
sit
down
one
minute
,
to
recover
my
failing
spirits
,
and
then
I
'll
tell
you
all
I
purpose
to
do
,
and
all
I
have
to
say
,
and
that
with
as
much
brevity
as
I
can
,
for
fear
neither
my
head
nor
my
heart
should
perform
the
part
I
have
been
so
long
in
endeavouring
to
prevail
upon
them
to
perform
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
sat
down
then
,
he
taking
out
the
letter
,
and
reading
it
again
with
much
vexation
and
anger
in
his
countenance
;
and
after
a
few
tears
and
sobs
,
that
would
needs
be
so
officious
as
to
offer
their
service
,
unbidden
,
and
undesired
,
to
introduce
what
I
had
to
say
;
I
rose
up
,
my
feet
trembling
,
as
well
as
my
knees
;
which
,
however
,
leaning
against
the
seats
of
the
chairs
,
that
made
my
bar
,
as
my
hand
held
by
the
back
,
tolerably
supported
me
,
I
cleared
my
voice
,
wiped
my
eyes
,
and
said
:
  
"
You
have
all
the
excuse
,
dear
Mr.
B.
,
that
a
gentleman
can
have
in
the
object
of
your
present
passion
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Present
passion
,
Pamela
!
"
  
"
Dear
Sir
,
hear
me
without
interruption
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
Countess
is
a
charming
lady
.
<EOS>
She
excels
your
poor
girl
in
all
those
outward
graces
of
form
,
which
your
kind
fancy
(
more
valued
by
me
than
the
opinion
of
all
the
world
besides
)
had
made
you
attribute
to
me
.
<EOS>
And
she
has
all
those
additional
advantages
,
as
nobleness
of
birth
,
of
alliance
,
and
deportment
,
which
I
want
.
<EOS>
(
Happy
for
you
,
Sir
,
that
you
had
known
her
ladyship
some
months
ago
,
before
you
disgraced
yourself
by
the
honours
you
have
done
me
!
)
<EOS>
This
therefore
frees
you
from
the
aggravated
crime
of
those
,
who
prefer
,
to
their
own
ladies
,
less
amiable
and
less
deserving
persons
;
and
I
have
not
the
sting
which
those
must
have
,
who
are
contemned
and
ill
-
treated
for
the
sake
of
their
inferiors
.
<EOS>
Yet
can
not
the
Countess
love
you
better
than
your
girl
loves
you
,
not
even
for
your
person
,
<EOS>
which
must
,
I
doubt
,
be
her
principal
attachment
!
<EOS>
when
I
can
truly
say
,
all
noble
and
attracting
to
the
outward
eye
as
it
is
,
that
is
the
least
consideration
by
far
with
me
:
<EOS>
no
,
Sir
,
your
generous
and
beneficent
mind
,
is
the
principal
object
of
my
affection
;
and
my
pride
in
hoping
to
be
an
humble
means
,
in
the
hands
of
Providence
,
to
bless
you
hereafter
as
well
as
here
,
gave
me
more
pleasure
than
all
the
blessings
I
reaped
from
your
name
or
your
fortune
.
<EOS>
Judge
then
,
my
dearest
Mr.
B.
,
my
grief
and
disappointment
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
will
not
expostulate
:
<EOS>
I
will
not
,
because
it
must
be
to
no
purpose
;
for
could
my
fondness
,
and
my
watchful
duty
to
you
,
have
kept
you
steady
,
I
should
not
now
appear
before
you
in
this
solemn
manner
:
and
I
know
the
charms
of
my
rival
are
too
powerful
for
me
to
contend
with
.
<EOS>
Nothing
but
divine
grace
can
touch
your
heart
:
and
that
I
expect
not
,
from
the
nature
of
the
case
,
should
be
instantaneous
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
therefore
.
<EOS>
Sir
,
dear
as
you
are
to
me
(
Do
n't
look
with
such
tender
surprise
upon
me
!
)
give
up
your
person
to
the
happier
,
to
my
worthier
rival
.
<EOS>
For
since
such
is
your
will
,
and
seem
to
be
your
engagements
,
what
avails
it
to
me
to
oppose
them
?
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
only
to
beg
,
that
you
will
be
so
good
as
to
permit
me
to
go
down
to
Kent
,
to
my
dear
parents
,
who
,
with
many
more
,
are
daily
rejoicing
in

my

Motives

have
their

force
upon
your

one
day

I
hope
;

blessed

God

such
a

so
much
temper

resignation

my

Mr.

come

the
piety

lift
us

raise
ourselves

Pamela

all
come

this

support
the
pangs

the
dying
hour

you

I
pressed
my
lips

his
head
was
reclined
on

throbbing
bosom

"
that
then
,
in
that
important
moment

what
now
gives
us
the
greatest
pleasure

will
have
any
part

our
consideration

as
it

give

woe

comfort

But
I
will
not

O

afflict
you
farther

Why
should
I
thus
sadden
all
your
gaudy
prospects

<EOS>
I
have
said
enough
to
such
a
heart
as
yours

if
Divine
grace
touches
it

And
if
not

all
I
can

will
be

no

I
will
leave
you
therefore
to
that
,

to
your
own
reflections

And
after
giving
you
ten
thousand
thanks

your
indulgent
patience

I
will
only
beg
,
that
I
may
set
out
in
a
week

Kent

with
my
dear
Billy

that
you
will
receive
one
letter
at

shall
not
be
of
upbraidings

exclamations

But
my
child

must
not
deny
me
;

I
shall
haunt
,
like
his
shadow

every
place

you
shall
put
my
Billy

should
be
so
unkind
to
deny
him
to

if
you
will
permit
me
to
have
the
dear
Miss
Goodwin
with
me
,
as
you
had
almost
led
me
to
hope

I
will
read
over
all
the
books
of
education

digest
them
,
as
well

I
am
able

in

to
send
you
my
scheme

to
show
you
how
fit

hope
your
indulgence

at

will
make

think
me

having
two
such
precious
trusts
reposed
in
me

<EOS>
I
was
silent
,
waiting
in
tears
his
answer

<EOS>
But
his
generous
heart
was
touched
,
and
seemed
to
labour
within
him
for
expression
.
  
<EOS>
He
came
round
to
me
at
last
,
and
took
me
in
his
arms
;
"
Exalted
creature

he
:

minded

thus
irresistibly
dazzle

weak
eyes

inconsiderately

blind
passion

object

I
never

equal

touched

may
subside
again

soul

promise

hope

believe

will
pardon
the
pain

have
given
you

made
me
fear
more
than
once

your
head
was
affected

so
uncommon

so
like
yourself

been
the
manner

your
acting

I
will
break
off
a
correspondence

has
given
you
so
much
uneasiness

and
my
Pamela
may
believe
,
that
if
I
can
be
as
good
as
my
word
in
this
point

she
will
never
more
be
in
danger

any
rival
whatever

But
say
,
my
dear
love

added
he

"
say
you
forgive
me
;

your
former
cheerfulness

affectionate
regards

often

your
disposal

<EOS>
Do
you
think
.
<EOS>
Madam
,
I
could
speak
any
one
distinct
sentence
?
<EOS>
No
indeed
I
could
not
.
<EOS>
I
was
just
choked
with
my
joy
;
I
never
was
so
before
.
<EOS>
And
my
eyes
were
in
a
manner
fixed
,
as
he
told
me
afterwards
;
and
that
he
was
a
little
startled
,
seeing
nothing
but
the
whites
;
for
the
sight
was
out
of
its
orbits
,
in
a
manner
lifted
up
to
heaven
 
in
ecstasy
for
a
turn
so
sudden
,
and
so
unexpected
!
  
<EOS>
We
were
forced
to
separate
soon
after
;
for
there
was
no
bearing
each
other
,
so
excessive
was
my
Joy
,
and
his
goodness
.
<EOS>
He
left
me
,
and
went
down
to
his
own
closet
.
  
<EOS>
Judge
my
employment
<EOS>
you
will
,
I
am
sure
,
my
dear
lady
.
<EOS>
I
had
new
ecstasy
to
be
blest
with
,
in
a
thankfulness
so
exalted
,
that
it
left
me
all
light
and
pleasant
,
as
if
I
had
shook
off
body
,
and
trod
in
air
;
so
much
heaviness
had
I
lost
,
and
so
much
joy
had
I
received
.
<EOS>
From
two
such
extremes
,
how
was
it
possible
<EOS>
I
could
presently
hit
the
medium
?
<EOS>
For
when
I
had
given
up
my
beloved
husband
,
as
lost
to
me
,
and
had
dreaded
the
consequences
to
his
future
state
:
to
find
him
not
only
untainted
as
to
deed
,
but
,
in
all
probability
,
mine
upon
better
and
surer
terms
than
ever
 
O
,
Madam
!
<EOS>
must
not
this
give
a
joy
beyond
all
joy
,
and
surpassing
all
expression
!

About
eight
o'clock
Mr.
B.
sent
me
up
these
lines
from
his
closet
,
which
will
explain
what
I
meant
,
as
to
the
papers
I
must
beg
your
ladyship
to
return
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Pamela
,
  
"
I
have
so
much
real
concern
at
the
anguish
I
have
given
you
,
and
am
so
much
affected
with
the
recollection
of
the
uncommon
scenes
which
passed
between
us
,
just
now
,
that
I
write
,
because
I
know
not
how
to
look
<EOS>
so
excellent
a
creature
in
the
face
 
<EOS>
You
must
therefore
sup
without
me
,
and
take
your
Mrs.
Jervis
to
bed
with
you
;
who
,
I
doubt
not
,
knows
all
this
affair
;
and
you
may
tell
her
the
happy
event
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
not
interfere
with
me
just
now
,
while
writing
upon
a
subject
which
takes
up
all
my
attention
;
and
which
,
requiring
great
delicacy
,
I
may
,
possibly
,
be
all
night
before
I
can
please
myself
in
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
determined
to
make
good
my
promise
to
you
.
<EOS>
But
if
you
have
written
to
your
mother
,
Miss
Darnford
,
or
to
Lady
Davers
,
anything
of
this
affair
,
you
must
shew
me
the
copies
,
and
let
me
into
every
tittle
how
you
came
by
your
information
.
<EOS>
I
solemnly
promise
you
,
on
my
honour
(
that
has
not
yet
been
violated
to
you
,
and
I
hope
never
will
)
,
that
not
a
soul
shall
know
or
suffer
by
the
communication
,
not
even
Turner
;
for
I
am
confident
he
has
had
some
hand
in
it
.
<EOS>
This
request
you
must
comply
with
,
if
you
can
confide
in
me
;
for
I
shall
make
some
use
of
it
(
as
prudent
a
one
as
I
am
able
)
,
for
the
sake
of
every
one
concerned
,
in
the
conclusion
of
the
correspondence
between
the
lady
and
myself
.
<EOS>
Whatever
you
may
have
said
in
the
bitterness
of
your
heart
,
in
the
letters
I
require
to
see
,
or
whatever
any
of
those
,
to
whom
they
are
directed
,
shall
say
,
on
the
bad
prospect
,
shall
be
forgiven
,
and
looked
upon
as
deserved
,
by
your
ever
-
obliged
and
faithful
,
&
c.
"
  
<EOS>
I
returned
the
following
:
  
"
Dearest
,
<EOS>
dear
Sir
,
  
"
I
will
not
break
in
upon
you
,
while
you
are
so
importantly
employed
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jervis
has
indeed
seen
my
concern
for
some
time
past
,
and
has
heard
rumours
,
as
I
know
by
hints
she
has
given
me
;
but
her
prudence
,
and
my
reserves
,
have
kept
us
from
saying
anything
to
one
another
of
it
.
<EOS>
Neither
my
mother
nor
Miss
Darnford
know
a
tittle
of
it
from
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
received
a
letter
of
civility
from
Miss
,
and
have
answered
it
,
taking
and
giving
thanks
for
the
pleasure
of
each
other
's
company
,
and
best
respects
from
her
,
and
the
Lincolnshire
families
,
to
your
dear
self
.
<EOS>
These
,
my
copy
,
and
her
original
<EOS>
,
you
shall
see
when
you
please
.
<EOS>
But
,
in
truth
,
all
that
has
passed
,
is
between
Lady
Davers
and
me
,
and
I
have
not
kept
copies
of
mine
;
but
I
will
dispatch
a
messenger
to
her
ladyship
for
them
,
if
you
please
,
in
the
morning
,
before
it
is
light
,
not
doubting
your
kind
promise
of
excusing
everything
and
everybody
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
beg
,
dear
Sir
,
you
will
take
care
<EOS>
your
health
suffers
not
by
your
sitting
up
;
for
the
nights
are
cold
and
damp
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
,
now
you
have
given
me
the
liberty
,
let
Mrs.
Jervis
know
how
happy
you
have
made
me
,
by
dissipating
my
fears
,
and
the
idle
rumours
,
as
I
shall
call
them
to
her
,
of
calumniators
.
  
<EOS>
"
God
bless
you
,
dear
Sir
,
for
your
goodness
and
favour
to
your
ever
-
dutiful
  
P.B.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
was
pleased
to
return
me
this
:
  
"
<EOS>
MY
DEAR
LIFE
,
  
<EOS>
"
You
need
not
be
in
such
haste
to
send
.
<EOS>
If
you
write
to
Lady
Davers
how
the
matter
has
ended
,
let
me
see
the
copy
of
it
:
and
be
very
particular
in
your
,
or
rather
,
my
trial
.
<EOS>
It
shall
be
a
standing
lesson
to
me
for
my
future
instruction
;
as
it
will
be
a
fresh
demonstration
of
your
excellence
,
which
every
hour
I
more
and
more
admire
.
<EOS>
I
am
glad
Lady
Davers
only
knows
the
matter
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
ought
to
avoid
seeing
you
,
till
I
can
assure
you
,
that
every
thing
is
accommodated
to
your
desire
.
<EOS>
Longman
has
sent
me
some
advices
,
which
will
make
it
proper
for
me
to
meet
him
at
Bedford
or
Gloucester
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
go
to
Tunbridge
,
till
I
have
all
your
papers
;
and
so
you
'll
have
three
days
to
procure
them
.
<EOS>
Your
boy
,
and
your
penmanship
,
will
find
you
no
disagreeable
employment
till
I
return
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
on
second
thoughts
,
I
will
do
myself
the
pleasure
of
breakfasting
with
you
in
the
morning
,
to
re
-
assure
you
of
my
unalterable
purpose
to
approve
myself
,
my
dearest
life
,
ever
faithfully
yours
.
"
  
<EOS>
Thus
,
I
hope
,
is
happily
ended
this
dreadful
affair
.
<EOS>
My
next
shall
give
the
particulars
of
our
breakfast
conversation
.
<EOS>
But
I
would
not
slip
this
post
,
without
acquainting
you
with
this
blessed
turn
;
and
to
beg
the
favour
of
you
to
send
me
back
my
letters
;
which
will
lay
a
new
obligation
upon
,
dear
Madam
,
your
obliged
sister
,
and
humble
servant
,
P.B.
    
MY
DEAREST
LADY
,
  
<EOS>
Your
joyful
correspondent
has
obtained
leave
to
get
every
thing
:
ready
to
quit
London
by
Friday
next
,
when
your
kind
brother
promises
to
carry
me
down
to
Kent
,
and
allows
me
to
take
my
charmer
with
me
.
<EOS>
There
's
happiness
for
you
,
Madam
!
<EOS>
To
see
,
as
I
hope
I
shall
see
,
upon
one
blessed
spot
,
a
dear
faithful
husband
,
a
beloved
child
,
and
a
father
and
mother
,
whom
I
so
much
love
and
honour
!
  
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
told
me
this
voluntarily
,
this
morning
at
breakfast
;
and
then
,
in
the
kindest
manner
,
took
leave
of
me
,
and
set
out
for
Bedfordshire
.
  
<EOS>
But
I
should
,
according
to
my
promise
,
give
you
a
few
particulars
of
our
breakfast
conference
.
  
<EOS>
I
bid
<EOS>
Polly
withdraw
,
when
her
master
came
up
to
breakfast
;
and
I
ran
to
the
door
to
meet
him
,
and
threw
myself
on
my
knees
:
"
O
forgive
me
,
dearest
,
<EOS>
dear
Sir
,
all
my
boldness
of
yesterday
!
 
<EOS>
My
heart
was
strangely
affected
 
or
I
could
not
have
acted
as
I
did
.
<EOS>
But
never
fear
,
my
dearest
Mr.
B.
,
that
my
future
conduct
shall
be
different
from
what
it
used
to
be
,
or
that
I
shall
keep
up
to
a
spirit
,
which
you
hardly
thought
had
place
in
the
heart
of
your
dutiful
Pamela
,
till
she
was
thus
severely
tried
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
weighed
well
your
conduct
,
my
dear
life
,
"
raising
me
to
his
bosom
;
"
and
I
find
an
uniformity
in
it
,
that
is
surprisingly
just
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
led
me
to
the
tea
-
table
,
and
sat
down
close
by
me
.
<EOS>
Polly
came
in
.
<EOS>
"
If
every
thing
,
"
said
he
,
"
be
here
,
that
your
lady
wants
,
you
may
withdraw
;
and
let
Colbrand
and
Abraham
know
I
shall
be
with
them
presently
.
<EOS>
Nobody
shall
wait
upon
me
<EOS>
but
you
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
"
Polly
withdrew
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
always
loved
you
,
my
dearest
,
"
added
he
,
"
and
that
with
a
passionate
fondness
,
which
has
not
,
I
dare
say
,
many
examples
in
the
married
life
:
but
I
revere
you
now
.
<EOS>
And
so
great
is
my
reverence
for
your
virtue
,
that
I
chose
to
sit
up
all
night
,
to
leave
you
for
a
few
days
,
until
,
by
disengaging
myself
from
all
intercourses
that
have
given
you
uneasiness
,
I
can
convince
you
,
that
I
have
rendered
myself
as
worthy
as
I
can
be
,
of
you
upon
your
own
terms
.
<EOS>
I
will
account
to
you
for
every
step
I
shall
take
,
and
will
reveal
to
you
every
step
I
have
taken
:
for
this
I
can
do
,
because
the
lady
's
honour
is
untainted
,
and
wicked
rumour
has
treated
her
worse
than
she
could
deserve
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
told
him
,
that
since
he
had
named
the
lady
,
I
would
take
the
liberty
to
say
,
I
was
glad
,
for
her
own
sake
,
to
hear
that
.
<EOS>
Changing
the
subject
a
little
precipitately
,
as
if
it
gave
him
pain
,
he
told
me
,
as
above
,
that
I
might
prepare
on
Friday
for
Kent
;
and
I
parted
with
him
with
greater
pleasure
than
ever
I
did
in
my
life
.
<EOS>
So
necessary
sometimes
are
afflictions
,
not
only
to
teach
one
how
to
subdue
one
's
passions
,
and
to
make
us
,
in
our
happiest
states
,
<EOS>
know
we
are
still
on
earth
,
but
even
when
they
are
overblown
to
augment
and
redouble
our
joys
!
  
<EOS>
I
am
now
giving
orders
for
my
journey
,
and
quitting
this
undelightful
town
,
as
it
has
been
,
and
is
,
to
me
.
<EOS>
My
next
will
be
from
Kent
,
I
hope
;
and
I
may
then
have
an
opportunity
to
acquaint
your
ladyship
with
the
particulars
,
and
(
if
God
answers
my
prayers
)
,
the
conclusion
of
the
affair
,
which
has
given
me
so
much
uneasiness
.
  
<EOS>
Meantime
,
I
am
,
with
the
greatest
gratitude
,
for
the
kind
share
you
have
taken
in
my
past
afflictions
,
my
good
lady
,
your
ladyship
's
most
obliged
sister
and
servant
,
  
P.B.
    
<EOS>
My
dearest
Pamela
,
  
Inclosed
are
all
the
letters
you
send
for
.
<EOS>
I
rejoice
with
you
upon
the
turn
this
afflicting
affair
has
taken
,
through
your
inimitable
prudence
,
and
a
courage
I
thought
not
in
you
.
<EOS>
A
wretch
!
 
<EOS>
to
give
you
so
much
discomposure
!
 
<EOS>
But
I
will
not
,
if
he
be
good
now
,
rave
against
him
,
as
I
was
going
to
do
.
<EOS>
I
am
impatient
to
hear
what
account
he
gives
of
the
matter
.
<EOS>
I
hope
he
will
be
able
to
abandon
this
 
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
call
her
names
;
for
she
loves
the
wretch
;
and
that
,
if
he
be
just
to
you
,
will
be
her
punishment
.
  
<EOS>
What
care
ought
these
young
widows
to
take
of
their
reputation
?
 
<EOS>
And
how
watchful
ought
they
to
be
over
themselves
!
 
<EOS>
She
was
hardly
out
of
her
weeds
,
and
yet
must
go
to
a
masquerade
,
and
tempt
her
fate
,
with
all
her
passions
about
her
,
with
an
independence
,
and
an
affluence
of
fortune
,
that
made
her
able
to
think
of
nothing
but
gratifying
them
.
  
<EOS>
She
has
good
qualities
 
<EOS>
is
generous
 
<EOS>
is
noble
 
but
has
strong
passions
,
and
is
thoughtless
and
precipitant
.
  
<EOS>
My
lord
came
home
last
Tuesday
,
with
a
long
story
of
my
brother
and
her
:
for
I
had
kept
the
matter
as
secret
as
I
could
,
for
his
sake
and
yours
.
<EOS>
It
seems
he
had
it
from
Sir
John
 
,
uncle
to
the
young
Lord
C.
,
who
is
very
earnest
to
bring
on
a
treaty
of
marriage
between
her
and
his
nephew
,
who
is
in
love
with
her
,
and
is
a
fine
young
gentleman
;
but
has
held
back
,
on
the
liberties
she
has
lately
given
herself
with
my
brother
.
  
<EOS>
I
hope
she
is
innocent
,
as
to
fact
;
but
I
know
not
what
to
say
to
it
.
<EOS>
He
ought
to
be
hanged
,
if
he
did
not
say
she
was
.
<EOS>
Yet
I
have
great
opinion
of
his
veracity
:
<EOS>
and
yet
he
is
so
bold
a
wretch
!
 
<EOS>
And
her
inconsideration
is
so
great
!
  
<EOS>
But
lest
I
should
alarm
your
fears
,
I
will
wait
till
I
have
the
account
he
gives
you
of
this
dark
affair
;
till
when
,
I
congratulate
you
upon
the
leave
you
have
obtained
to
quit
the
town
,
and
on
your
setting
out
for
a
place
so
much
nearer
to
Tunbridge
.
<EOS>
Forgive
me
,
Pamela
;
but
he
is
an
intriguing
wretch
,
and
I
would
not
have
you
to
be
too
secure
,
lest
the
disappointment
should
be
worse
for
you
,
than
what
you
knew
before
:
but
assure
yourself
,
that
I
am
in
all
cases
and
events
,
your
affectionate
sister
and
admirer
,
  
B.
DAVERS
.
    
<EOS>
From
Mrs.
B.
to
Lady
Davers
.
  
<EOS>
MY
DEAREST
LADY
,
  
Mr.
B.
came
back
from
Bedfordshire
to
his
time
.
<EOS>
Every
thing
being
in
readiness
,
we
set
out
with
my
baby
,
and
his
nurse
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jervis
,
when
every
thing
in
London
is
settled
by
her
direction
,
goes
to
Bedfordshire
.
  
<EOS>
We
were
met
by
my
father
and
mother
in
a
chaise
and
pair
,
which
your
kind
brother
had
presented
to
them
unknown
to
me
,
that
they
might
often
take
the
air
together
,
and
go
to
church
in
it
(
which
is
at
some
distance
)
on
Sundays
.
<EOS>
The
driver
is
clothed
in
a
good
brown
cloth
suit
,
but
no
livery
;
for
that
my
parents
could
not
have
borne
,
as
Mr.
B.
's
goodness
made
him
consider
.
  
<EOS>
Your
ladyship
must
needs
think
,
how
we
were
all
overjoyed
at
this
meeting
:
for
my
own
part
I
can
not
express
how
much
I
was
transported
when
we
arrived
at
the
farm
-
house
,
to
see
all
I
delighted
in
,
upon
one
happy
spot
together
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
is
much
pleased
with
the
alterations
here
:
and
it
is
a
sweet
,
rural
,
and
convenient
place
.
  
<EOS>
We
were
welcomed
into
these
parts
by
the
bells
,
and
by
the
minister
,
and
people
of
most
note
;
and
were
at
church
together
on
Sunday
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
is
to
set
out
on
Tuesday
for
Tunbridge
,
with
my
papers
.
<EOS>
A
happy
issue
,
attend
that
affair
,
I
pray
God
!
<EOS>
He
has
given
me
the
following
particulars
of
it
,
to
the
time
of
my
trial
,
beginning
at
the
masquerade
.
  
<EOS>
He
says
,
that
at
the
masquerade
,
when
,
pleased
with
the
fair
Nun
's
shape
,
air
and
voice
,
he
had
followed
her
to
a
corner
most
unobserved
,
she
said
in
Italian
,
"
Why
are
my
retirements
invaded
,
audacious
Spaniard
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Because
,
my
dear
Nun
,
I
hope
you
would
have
it
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
no
otherwise
,
"
returned
she
,
"
strike
dead
thy
bold
presumption
,
than
to
shew
thee
<EOS>
my
scorn
and
anger
thus
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
she
unmasking
surprised
me
,
"
said
Mr.
B.
,
"
with
a
face
as
beautiful
,
but
not
so
soft
as
my
Pamela
's
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
I
,
"
said
Mr.
B.
,
"
to
shew
<EOS>
I
can
defy
your
resentment
,
will
shew
you
a
countenance
as
intrepid
as
yours
is
lovely
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
so
he
drew
aside
his
mask
too
.
  
<EOS>
He
says
,
he
observed
his
fair
Nun
to
be
followed
wherever
she
went
,
by
a
mask
habited
like
Testimony
in
Sir
Courtly
Nice
,
whose
attention
was
fixed
upon
her
and
him
;
and
he
doubted
not
,
that
it
was
Mr.
Turner
.
<EOS>
So
he
and
the
fair
Nun
took
different
ways
,
and
he
joined
me
and
Miss
Darnford
,
and
found
me
engaged
as
I
before
related
to
your
ladyship
,
and
his
Nun
at
his
elbow
unexpected
.
  
<EOS>
That
afterwards
as
he
was
engaged
in
French
with
a
lady
who
had
the
dress
of
an
Indian
Princess
,
and
the
mask
of
an
Ethiopian
,
his
fair
Nun
said
,
in
broken
Spanish
,
"
Art
thou
at
all
complexions
?
 
<EOS>
By
St.
Ignatius
,
I
believe
thou'rt
a
rover
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
trying
,
"
replied
he
in
Italian
,
"
whether
I
can
meet
with
any
lady
comparable
to
my
lovely
Nun
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
is
the
result
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Not
one
:
no
not
one
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
wish
you
could
not
help
being
in
earnest
,
"
said
she
;
and
slid
from
him
.
  
<EOS>
He
engaged
her
next
at
the
sideboard
,
drinking
under
her
veil
a
glass
of
Champaign
.
<EOS>
"
You
know
,
Pamela
,
"
said
he
,
"
there
never
was
a
sweeter
mouth
in
the
world
than
the
Countess
's
except
your
own
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
drew
away
the
glass
,
as
if
unobserved
by
any
body
,
to
shew
me
the
lower
part
of
her
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
say
,
but
I
was
struck
with
her
charming
manner
,
and
an
unreservedness
of
air
and
behaviour
,
that
I
had
not
before
seen
so
becoming
.
<EOS>
The
place
,
and
the
freedom
of
conversation
and
deportment
allowed
there
,
gave
her
great
advantages
in
my
eye
,
although
her
habit
required
,
as
I
thought
,
a
little
more
gravity
and
circumspection
:
and
I
could
not
tell
how
to
resist
a
secret
pride
and
vanity
,
which
is
but
too
natural
to
both
sexes
,
when
they
are
taken
notice
of
by
persons
so
worthy
of
regard
.
  
<EOS>
"
Naturally
fond
of
every
thing
that
carried
the
face
of
an
intrigue
,
I
longed
to
know
who
this
charming
<EOS>
Nun
was
.
<EOS>
And
next
time
I
engaged
her
,
"
<EOS>
My
good
sister
,
"
said
I
,
"
<EOS>
how
happy
should
I
be
,
if
I
might
be
admitted
to
a
conversation
with
you
at
your
grate
!
"
  
"
"
<EOS>
Answer
me
,
"
said
she
,
"
thou
bold
Spaniard
,
"
(
for
that
was
a
name
<EOS>
she
seemed
fond
of
,
which
gave
me
to
imagine
,
that
boldness
was
a
qualification
<EOS>
she
was
not
displeased
with
.
'
<EOS>
Tis
not
unusual
with
our
vain
sex
,
"
observed
he
,
"
to
construe
even
reproaches
to
our
advantage
,
"
)
"
is
the
lady
here
,
whose
shackles
thou
wearest
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Do
I
look
like
a
man
shackled
,
my
fairest
Nun
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
 
no
!
<EOS>
not
much
like
such
an
one
.
<EOS>
But
I
fancy
thy
wife
is
either
a
Widow
or
a
Quaker
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Neither
,
"
replied
I
,
taking
,
by
equivocation
,
her
question
literally
.
  
<EOS>
"
"
And
art
thou
not
a
married
wretch
?
<EOS>
Answer
me
quickly
!
 
<EOS>
We
are
observed
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
I.
 
"
Swear
to
me
,
thou
art
not
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
By
St.
Ignatius
,
then
;
"
for
,
my
dear
,
I
was
no
wretch
,
you
know
.
 
<EOS>
"
Enough
!
"
said
she
,
and
slid
away
;
and
the
Fanatic
would
fain
have
engaged
her
,
but
she
avoided
him
as
industriously
.
  
<EOS>
"
Before
I
was
aware
,
she
was
at
my
elbow
,
and
,
in
Italian
,
said
,
"
That
fair
Quaker
,
yonder
,
is
the
wit
of
the
assemblee
;
her
eyes
seem
always
directed
to
thy
motions
;
and
her
person
shews
some
intimacies
have
passed
with
somebody
;
is
it
with
thee
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
my
glory
if
it
was
,
"
said
I
,
"
were
her
face
answerable
to
her
person
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Is
it
not
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
long
to
know
,
"
replied
Mr.
B.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
thou
dost
not
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
to
hear
my
fair
<EOS>
Nun
say
that
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Dost
thou
,
"
said
she
,
"
hate
shackles
?
<EOS>
Or
is
it
,
that
thy
hour
is
not
yet
come
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
,
"
replied
he
,
"
this
be
not
the
hour
,
the
very
hour
!
"
<EOS>
pretending
(
naughty
gentleman
!
 
<EOS>
What
ways
these
men
have
!
)
<EOS>
to
sigh
.
  
<EOS>
She
went
again
to
the
side
-
board
,
and
put
her
handkerchief
upon
it
.
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
followed
,
and
observed
all
her
motions
.
<EOS>
She
drank
a
glass
of
lemonade
,
as
he
of
Burgundy
;
and
a
person
in
a
domino
,
supposed
to
be
the
King
,
passing
by
,
took
up
every
one
's
attention
but
Mr.
B.
's
who
eyed
her
handkerchief
,
not
doubting
<EOS>
but
she
laid
it
there
on
purpose
to
forget
to
take
it
up
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
she
left
it
there
;
and
slipping
by
him
,
he
,
unobserved
,
as
he
believes
,
put
it
in
his
pocket
,
and
at
the
corner
<EOS>
found
the
cover
of
a
letter
 
<EOS>
"
To
the
Right
Honourable
the
Countess
Dowager
of
#
#
#
#
"
   
That
after
this
,
the
fair
Nun
was
so
shy
,
so
reserved
,
and
seemed
so
studiously
to
avoid
him
,
that
he
had
no
opportunity
to
return
her
handkerchief
;
and
the
Fanatic
observing
how
she
shunned
him
,
said
,
in
French
,
"
What
,
Monsieur
,
have
you
done
to
your
Nun
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
found
her
to
be
a
very
coquette
;
and
told
her
so
;
and
she
is
offended
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
could
you
affront
a
lady
,
"
replied
he
,
"
with
such
a
charming
face
?
  
<EOS>
"
By
that
I
had
reason
to
think
,
"
said
Mr.
B.
,
"
that
he
had
seen
her
unmask
;
and
I
said
,
"
It
becomes
not
any
character
,
but
that
you
wear
,
to
pry
into
the
secrets
of
others
,
in
order
to
make
ill
-
natured
remarks
,
and
perhaps
to
take
ungentlemanlike
advantages
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
No
man
should
make
that
observation
,
"
returned
he
,
"
whose
views
would
bear
prying
into
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
nettled
,
"
said
Mr.
B.
,
"
at
this
warm
retort
,
and
drew
aside
my
mask
:
"
<EOS>
Nor
would
any
man
,
who
wore
not
a
mask
,
tell
me
so
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
took
not
the
challenge
,
and
slid
from
me
,
and
I
saw
him
no
more
that
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
So
!
<EOS>
"
thought
I
,
"
another
instance
this
might
have
been
of
the
glorious
consequences
of
masquerading
.
<EOS>
"
O
my
lady
,
these
masquerades
are
abominable
things
!
  
<EOS>
The
King
,
they
said
,
met
with
a
free
speaker
that
night
:
in
truth
,
I
was
not
very
sorry
for
it
;
for
if
monarchs
will
lay
aside
their
sovereign
distinctions
,
and
mingle
thus
in
masquerade
with
the
worst
as
well
as
the
highest
<EOS>
(
I
can
not
say
best
)
of
their
subjects
,
let
'em
take
the
consequence
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
they
might
have
a
chance
to
hear
more
truth
here
than
in
their
palaces
 
the
only
good
that
possibly
can
accrue
from
them
 
that
is
to
say
,
if
they
made
a
good
use
of
it
when
they
heard
it
.
<EOS>
For
you
see
,
my
monarch
,
though
he
told
the
truth
,
as
it
happened
,
received
the
hint
with
more
resentment
than
thankfulness
!
 
<EOS>
So
,
'
tis
too
likely
did
the
monarch
of
us
both
.
  
<EOS>
And
now
,
my
lady
,
you
need
not
doubt
,
that
so
polite
a
gentleman
would
find
an
opportunity
to
return
the
Nun
her
handkerchief
!
 
<EOS>
To
be
sure
he
would
:
for
what
man
of
honour
would
rob
a
lady
of
any
part
of
her
apparel
?
<EOS>
And
should
he
,
that
wanted
to
steal
a
heart
content
himself
with
a
handkerchief
?
 
<EOS>
No
no
,
that
was
not
to
be
expected
.
<EOS>
So
,
what
does
he
do
,
but
resolve
,
the
very
next
day
,
after
dinner
,
to
pursue
this
affair
:
<EOS>
accordingly
,
the
poor
Quaker
little
thinking
of
the
matter
,
away
goes
her
naughty
Spaniard
,
to
find
out
his
Nun
at
her
grate
,
or
in
her
parlour
rather
.
  
<EOS>
He
asks
for
the
Countess
.
<EOS>
Is
admitted
into
the
outward
parlour
 
<EOS>
her
woman
comes
down
;
requires
his
name
and
business
.
<EOS>
His
name
he
mentioned
not
.
<EOS>
His
business
was
,
to
restore
into
her
lady
's
own
hands
,
something
she
had
dropt
<EOS>
the
night
before
.
 
<EOS>
Was
desired
to
wait
.
  
<EOS>
I
should
have
said
,
that
he
was
dressed
very
richly
 
having
no
design
at
all
to
make
conquests
;
<EOS>
no
,
not
he
!
 
<EOS>
O
this
wicked
love
of
intrigue
!
 
<EOS>
A
kind
of
olive
-
coloured
velvet
,
and
fine
brocaded
waistcoat
.
<EOS>
I
said
,
when
he
took
leave
of
me
,
"
You
're
a
charming
Mr.
B.
,
"
and
saluted
him
,
more
pressingly
than
he
returned
it
;
but
little
<EOS>
did
I
think
,
when
I
plaited
so
smooth
his
rich
laced
ruffles
,
and
bosom
,
where
he
was
going
,
or
what
he
had
in
his
plotting
heart
.
<EOS>
He
went
in
his
own
chariot
,
that
he
did
:
so
that
he
had
no
design
to
conceal
who
he
was
 
<EOS>
But
intrigue
,
a
new
conquest
,
vanity
,
pride
!
 
<EOS>
O
these
men
!
 
<EOS>
They
had
need
talk
of
ladies
!
 
<EOS>
But
it
is
half
our
own
fault
,
indeed
it
is
,
to
encourage
their
vanity
.
  
<EOS>
Well
,
Madam
,
he
waited
till
his
stateliness
was
moved
to
send
up
again
,
that
he
would
wait
on
her
ladyship
some
other
time
.
<EOS>
So
down
she
came
,
dressed
most
richly
,
jewels
in
her
breast
,
and
in
her
hair
,
and
ears
 
<EOS>
But
with
a
very
reserved
and
stately
air
.
<EOS>
He
approached
her
 
Methinks
<EOS>
I
see
him
,
dear
saucy
gentleman
.
<EOS>
You
know
,
Madam
,
what
a
noble
manner
of
address
he
has
.
  
<EOS>
He
took
the
handkerchief
from
his
bosom
with
an
air
;
and
kissing
it
,
presented
it
to
her
,
saying
,
"
This
happy
estray
,
thus
restored
,
begs
leave
,
by
me
,
to
acknowledge
its
lovely
owner
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
mean
you
,
Sir
?
 
<EOS>
Who
are
you
,
Sir
?
 
<EOS>
What
mean
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Your
ladyship
will
excuse
me
:
but
I
am
incapable
of
meaning
any
thing
<EOS>
but
what
is
honourable
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
(
No
,
to
be
sure
)
 
<EOS>
"
This
,
Madam
,
you
left
last
night
,
when
the
domino
took
up
every
one
's
attention
but
mine
,
which
was
much
better
engaged
;
and
I
take
the
liberty
to
restore
it
to
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
turned
to
the
mark
;
a
coronet
at
one
corner
,
"
'
<EOS>
Tis
true
,
Sir
,
I
see
now
it
is
one
of
mine
:
but
such
a
trifle
was
not
worthy
of
being
brought
by
such
a
gentleman
as
you
seem
to
be
;
nor
of
my
trouble
to
receive
it
in
person
.
<EOS>
Your
servant
,
Sir
,
might
have
delivered
the
bagatelle
to
mine
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Nothing
should
be
called
so
that
belongs
to
the
Countess
of
#
#
#
#
<EOS>
"
  
"
She
was
no
Countess
,
Sir
,
that
dropt
that
handkerchief
,
and
a
gentleman
would
not
attempt
to
penetrate
,
unbecomingly
,
through
the
disguises
a
lady
thinks
proper
to
assume
;
especially
at
such
a
place
where
every
enquiry
should
begin
and
end
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
,
Madam
,
from
a
lady
,
who
had
unmasked
 
because
she
would
not
be
known
!
 
<EOS>
Very
pretty
,
indeed
!
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
these
slight
cobweb
airs
of
modesty
!
<EOS>
so
easily
seen
through
.
<EOS>
Hence
such
advantages
against
us
are
taken
by
the
men
.
<EOS>
She
had
looked
out
of
her
window
,
and
seen
no
arms
quartered
with
his
own
;
for
you
know
,
my
lady
,
I
would
never
permit
any
to
be
procured
for
me
:
<EOS>
so
,
she
doubted
not
,
it
seems
,
but
he
was
an
unmarried
gentleman
,
as
he
had
intimated
to
her
the
night
before
.
<EOS>
He
told
her
it
was
impossible
,
after
having
seen
the
finest
lady
in
the
world
,
not
to
wish
to
see
her
again
;
and
that
he
hoped
he
did
not
,
unbecomingly
,
break
through
her
ladyship
's
reserves
:
nor
had
he
made
any
enquiries
,
either
on
the
spot
,
or
off
it
;
having
had
a
much
better
direction
by
accident
.
  
<EOS>
"
As
how
,
Sir
?
"
said
she
,
as
he
told
me
,
with
so
bewitching
an
air
,
between
attentive
and
pleasant
,
that
,
bold
gentleman
,
forgetting
all
manner
of
distance
,
so
early
too
!
<EOS>
he
clasped
his
arms
around
her
waist
,
and
saluted
her
,
struggling
with
anger
and
indignation
,
he
says
;
but
I
think
little
of
that
!
  
<EOS>
"
Whence
this
insolence
?
<EOS>
How
,
now
,
Sir
!
Begone
!
"
were
her
words
,
and
she
rung
the
bell
;
but
he
set
his
back
against
the
door
(
I
never
heard
such
boldness
in
my
life
,
Madam
!
)
 
<EOS>
till
she
would
forgive
him
.
<EOS>
And
,
it
is
plain
,
she
was
not
so
angry
as
she
pretended
:
for
her
woman
coming
<EOS>
,
she
was
calmer
;
 
<EOS>
"
Nelthorpe
,
"
said
she
,
"
fetch
my
snuff
box
,
with
the
lavender
in
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Her
woman
went
;
and
then
she
said
,
"
You
told
me
,
Sir
,
last
night
,
of
your
intrepidness
:
I
think
you
are
the
boldest
man
I
ever
met
with
:
<EOS>
but
,
Sir
,
surely
you
ought
to
know
,
that
you
are
not
now
in
the
Haymarket
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
think
,
truly
,
Madam
,
the
lady
might
have
saved
herself
that
speech
:
for
,
upon
my
word
,
they
neither
of
them
wore
masks
 
<EOS>
Though
they
ought
to
have
put
on
one
of
blushes
 
<EOS>
I
am
sure
I
do
for
them
,
while
I
am
writing
.
<EOS>
Her
irresistible
loveliness
served
for
an
excuse
,
that
she
could
not
disapprove
from
a
man
she
disliked
not
:
and
his
irresistible
 
<EOS>
may
I
say
,
assurance
,
Madam
?
 
<EOS>
found
too
ready
an
excuse
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
but
,
Sir
,
"
said
I
,
"
pray
,
when
her
ladyship
was
made
acquainted
that
you
were
a
married
gentleman
,
how
then
?
 
<EOS>
Pray
,
did
she
find
it
out
,
or
did
you
tell
her
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Patience
,
my
dear
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
pray
,
Sir
,
go
on
.
 
<EOS>
What
was
next
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
next
,
I
put
on
a
more
respectful
and
tender
air
:
I
would
have
taken
her
hand
indeed
,
but
she
would
not
permit
it
;
and
when
she
saw
I
would
not
go
till
<EOS>
her
lavender
snuff
came
down
(
for
so
<EOS>
I
told
her
,
and
her
woman
was
not
in
haste
)
,
she
seated
herself
,
and
I
sat
by
her
,
and
began
to
talk
about
a
charming
lady
I
saw
the
night
before
,
after
parting
with
her
ladyship
,
but
not
equal
by
any
means
to
her
:
and
<EOS>
I
was
confident
this
would
engage
her
attention
;
for
I
never
knew
the
lady
who
thought
herself
handsome
,
that
was
not
taken
by
this
topic
.
<EOS>
Flattery
and
admiration
,
Pamela
,
are
the
two
principal
engines
by
which
our
sex
make
their
first
approaches
to
yours
;
and
if
you
listen
to
us
,
we
are
sure
,
either
by
the
sap
or
the
mine
,
to
succeed
,
and
blow
you
up
when
ever
we
please
,
if
we
do
but
take
care
to
suit
ourselves
to
your
particular
foibles
;
or
,
to
carry
on
the
metaphor
,
point
our
batteries
to
your
weak
side
 
for
the
strongest
fortresses
,
my
dear
,
are
weaker
in
one
place
than
another
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
A
fine
thing
,
Sir
,
"
said
I
,
"
to
be
so
learned
a
gentleman
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
wish
,
however
,
"
thought
I
,
"
you
had
always
come
honestly
by
your
knowledge
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
When
the
lavender
snuff
came
down
,
we
were
engaged
in
an
agreeable
disputation
,
which
I
had
raised
on
purpose
to
excite
her
opposition
,
she
having
all
the
advantage
in
it
;
and
in
order
to
my
giving
it
up
,
when
she
was
intent
upon
it
,
as
a
mark
of
my
consideration
for
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
the
less
wonder
,
Sir
,
"
said
I
,
"
at
your
boldness
(
pardon
the
word
!
)
<EOS>
with
such
a
lady
,
in
your
first
visit
,
because
of
her
freedoms
,
when
masked
,
her
unmasking
,
and
her
handkerchief
,
and
letter
cover
.
<EOS>
To
be
sure
,
the
lady
,
when
she
saw
,
next
day
,
such
a
fine
gentleman
and
handsome
equipage
,
had
little
reason
,
after
her
other
freedoms
,
to
be
so
very
nice
with
you
as
to
decline
an
ensnaring
conversation
,
calculated
on
purpose
to
engage
her
attention
,
and
to
lengthen
out
your
visit
.
<EOS>
But
did
she
not
ask
you
who
you
were
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Her
servants
did
of
mine
.
<EOS>
And
her
woman
(
for
I
knew
all
afterwards
,
when
we
were
better
acquainted
)
,
whispered
her
lady
,
that
I
was
Mr.
B.
of
Bedfordshire
;
and
had
an
immense
estate
,
to
which
they
were
so
kind
as
to
add
two
or
three
thousand
pounds
a
year
,
out
of
pure
good
will
to
me
:
I
thank
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
But
pray
,
dear
Sir
,
what
had
you
in
view
in
all
this
?
<EOS>
Did
you
intend
to
carry
this
matter
,
at
first
,
as
far
as
ever
<EOS>
you
could
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
had
,
at
first
,
my
dear
,
no
view
,
but
such
as
pride
and
vanity
suggested
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
was
carried
away
by
inconsideration
,
and
the
love
of
intrigue
,
without
even
thinking
about
the
consequences
.
<EOS>
The
lady
,
I
observed
,
had
abundance
of
fine
qualities
.
<EOS>
I
thought
I
could
converse
with
her
,
on
a
very
agreeable
foot
,
and
her
honour
I
knew
,
at
any
time
,
would
preserve
me
mine
,
if
ever
I
should
find
it
in
danger
;
and
,
in
my
soul
,
I
preferred
my
Pamela
to
all
the
ladies
on
earth
,
and
questioned
not
,
but
that
,
and
your
virtue
,
would
be
another
barrier
to
my
fidelity
.
  
<EOS>
"
In
a
word
,
therefore
,
pride
,
vanity
,
thoughtlessness
,
were
my
misguiders
,
as
I
said
.
<EOS>
The
Countess
's
honour
and
character
,
and
your
virtue
and
merit
,
my
dear
,
and
my
obligations
to
you
,
were
my
defences
:
but
I
find
one
should
avoid
the
first
appearances
of
evil
.
<EOS>
One
knows
not
one
's
own
strength
.
'
<EOS>
Tis
presumptuous
to
depend
upon
it
,
where
wit
and
beauty
are
in
the
way
on
one
side
,
and
youth
and
strong
passions
on
the
other
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
certainly
,
Sir
,
say
right
.
<EOS>
But
be
pleased
to
tell
me
what
her
ladyship
said
when
she
knew
you
were
married
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
Countess
's
woman
was
in
my
interest
,
and
let
me
into
some
of
her
lady
's
secrets
,
having
a
great
share
in
her
confidence
;
and
particularly
acquainted
me
,
<EOS>
how
loth
her
lady
was
to
believe
I
was
married
.
<EOS>
I
had
paid
her
three
visits
in
town
,
and
one
to
her
seat
upon
the
Forest
,
before
she
heard
that
I
was
.
<EOS>
But
when
she
was
assured
of
it
,
and
directed
her
Nelthorpe
to
ask
me
about
it
,
and
I
readily
owned
it
,
she
was
greatly
incensed
,
though
nothing
but
general
civilities
,
and
intimacies
not
inconsistent
with
honourable
friendship
,
had
passed
between
us
.
<EOS>
The
consequence
was
,
she
forbad
my
ever
seeing
her
again
,
and
set
out
with
her
sister
and
the
Viscount
for
Tunbridge
,
where
she
staid
about
three
weeks
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
thought
I
had
already
gone
too
far
,
and
blamed
myself
for
permitting
her
so
long
to
believe
me
single
;
and
here
the
matter
had
dropped
,
in
all
probability
,
had
not
a
ball
,
given
by
my
Lord
#
#
#
#
,
 
to
which
,
unknown
to
each
other
,
we
were
both
,
as
also
the
Viscountess
,
invited
,
brought
us
again
together
.
<EOS>
The
lady
soon
withdrew
,
with
her
sister
,
to
another
apartment
;
and
being
resolved
upon
personal
recrimination
(
which
is
what
a
lady
,
who
is
resolved
to
break
with
a
favoured
object
,
should
never
trust
herself
with
,
)
sent
for
me
,
and
reproached
me
on
my
conduct
,
in
which
her
sister
joined
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
owned
frankly
,
that
gaiety
,
rather
than
design
,
made
me
give
cause
,
at
the
masquerade
,
for
her
ladyship
to
think
I
was
not
married
;
for
that
I
had
a
wife
,
with
a
thousand
excellencies
,
who
was
my
pride
,
and
my
boast
:
that
I
held
it
very
possible
for
a
gentleman
and
lady
to
carry
on
an
innocent
and
honourable
friendship
,
in
a
family
way
;
and
I
was
sure
,
when
she
and
her
sister
saw
my
spouse
,
they
would
not
be
displeased
with
her
acquaintance
;
<EOS>
all
that
I
had
to
reproach
myself
with
,
was
,
that
after
having
,
at
the
masquerade
,
given
reason
to
think
I
was
not
married
,
I
had
been
both
,
officiously
,
to
say
I
was
,
although
I
never
intended
to
conceal
it
.
<EOS>
In
short
,
I
acquitted
myself
so
well
with
both
ladies
,
that
a
family
intimacy
was
consented
to
.
<EOS>
I
renewed
my
visits
;
and
we
accounted
to
one
another
's
honour
,
by
entering
upon
a
kind
of
Platonic
system
,
in
which
sex
was
to
have
no
manner
of
concern
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
my
dear
Pamela
,
I
must
own
myself
extremely
blameable
,
because
I
knew
the
world
and
human
nature
,
I
will
say
,
better
than
the
lady
,
who
never
before
had
been
trusted
into
it
upon
her
own
feet
:
and
who
,
notwithstanding
that
wit
and
vivacity
which
every
one
admires
in
her
,
gave
herself
little
time
for
consideration
.
<EOS>
I
ought
,
therefore
,
to
have
more
carefully
guarded
against
inconveniencies
,
which
I
knew
were
so
likely
to
arise
from
such
intimacies
;
and
the
rather
,
as
I
hinted
,
because
the
lady
had
no
apprehension
at
all
of
any
:
so
that
,
my
dear
,
if
I
have
no
excuse
from
human
frailty
,
from
youth
,
and
the
charms
of
the
object
,
I
am
entirely
destitute
of
any
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
see
,
Mr.
B.
,
"
said
I
,
"
there
is
a
great
deal
to
be
said
for
the
lady
.
<EOS>
I
wish
I
could
say
there
was
for
the
gentleman
.
<EOS>
But
such
a
fine
lady
had
been
safe
,
with
all
her
inconsideration
;
and
so
(
forgive
me
.
<EOS>
Sir
,
)
would
the
gentleman
,
with
all
his
intriguing
spirit
,
had
it
not
been
for
these
vile
masquerades
.
<EOS>
Never
,
dear
Sir
,
think
of
going
to
another
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
my
dear
,
those
are
least
of
all
to
be
trusted
at
these
diversions
,
who
are
most
desirous
to
go
to
them
.
 
<EOS>
Of
this
I
am
now
fully
convinced
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
Sir
,
I
long
to
hear
more
particulars
of
this
story
:
for
this
generous
openness
,
now
the
affair
is
over
,
can
not
but
be
grateful
to
me
,
as
it
shews
me
you
have
no
reserve
,
and
tends
to
convince
me
,
that
the
lady
was
less
blameable
than
I
apprehended
:
for
I
love
,
for
the
honour
of
my
sex
,
to
find
ladies
of
birth
and
quality
innocent
,
who
have
so
many
opportunities
of
knowing
and
practising
their
duties
,
above
what
meaner
persons
can
have
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
observed
,
my
dear
:
<EOS>
this
is
like
your
generous
and
deep
way
of
thinking
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
dear
Sir
,
proceed
 
Your
reconciliation
is
now
effected
;
a
friendship
quadripartite
is
commenced
.
<EOS>
And
the
Viscountess
and
I
are
to
find
cement
for
the
erecting
of
an
edifice
,
that
is
to
be
devoted
to
Platonic
love
.
<EOS>
What
,
may
I
ask
,
came
next
?
<EOS>
And
what
did
you
design
should
come
of
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
Oxford
journey
,
my
dear
,
followed
next
;
and
it
was
my
fault
<EOS>
you
were
not
a
party
in
it
,
both
ladies
being
very
desirous
of
your
company
:
but
it
was
the
time
you
were
not
going
abroad
,
after
your
lying
-
in
,
so
I
excused
you
to
them
.
<EOS>
Yet
they
both
longed
to
see
you
:
especially
as
by
this
time
,
you
may
believe
,
they
knew
all
your
story
:
and
besides
,
whenever
you
were
mentioned
,
I
did
justice
,
as
well
to
your
mind
,
as
to
your
person
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Sir
,
to
be
sure
this
was
very
kind
;
and
little
was
<EOS>
I
disposed
(
knowing
what
I
did
,
)
to
pass
so
favourable
a
construction
in
your
generosity
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
question
to
her
ladyship
at
going
away
,
whether
you
were
not
the
charmingest
girl
in
the
world
,
which
seeing
you
both
together
,
rich
as
she
was
drest
,
and
plain
as
you
,
gave
me
the
double
pleasure
(
a
pleasure
<EOS>
she
said
afterwards
I
exulted
in
,
)
of
deciding
in
your
favour
;
my
readiness
to
explain
to
you
what
we
both
said
,
and
her
not
ungenerous
answer
<EOS>
,
I
thought
entitled
me
to
a
better
return
than
a
flood
of
tears
;
which
confirmed
me
that
your
past
uneasiness
was
a
jealousy
<EOS>
I
was
not
willing
to
allow
in
you
:
though
I
should
have
been
more
indulgent
to
it
<EOS>
had
I
known
the
grounds
you
thought
you
had
for
it
:
<EOS>
and
for
this
reason
I
left
you
so
abruptly
as
I

<EOS>
Here
,
Madam
,
Mr.
B.
broke
off
,
referring
to
another
time
the
conclusion
of
his
narrative
.
<EOS>
I
will
here
close
this
letter
<EOS>
(
though
possibly
I
may
not
send
it
,
till
I
send
the
conclusion
of
this
story
in
my
next
,
)
with
the
assurance
that
I
am
your
ladyship
's
obliged
sister
and
servant
,
  
P.B.
    
<EOS>
My
dear
lady
,
  
Now
I
will
proceed
with
my
former
subject
:
and
with
the
greater
pleasure
,
as
what
follows
makes
still
more
in
favour
of
the
Countess
's
character
,
than
what
went
before
,
although
that
set
it
in
a
better
light
than
it
had
once
appeared
to
me
in
.
<EOS>
I
began
as
follows
:
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
be
pleased
,
Sir
,
to
favour
me
with
the
continuation
of
our
last
subject
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
,
my
dear
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
left
off
,
Sir
,
with
acquitting
me
for
breaking
out
into
that
flood
of
tears
,
which
occasioned
your
abrupt
departure
.
<EOS>
But
,
dear
Sir
,
will
you
be
pleased
,
to
satisfy
me
about
that
affecting
information
,
of
your
intention
and
my
lady
's
to
live
at
Tunbridge
together
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
'
Tis
absolute
malice
and
falsehood
.
<EOS>
Our
intimacy
had
not
proceeded
so
far
;
and
,
thoughtless
as
my
sister
's
letters
suppose
the
lady
,
she
would
have
spurned
at
such
a
proposal
,
I
dare
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Well
,
but
then
,
Sir
,
as
to
the
expression
to
her
uncle
,
that
she
had
rather
have
been
a
certain
gentleman
's
second
wife
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
she
might
,
in
a
passion
,
say
something
like
it
to
him
:
he
had
been
teazing
her
(
from
the
time
that
I
held
an
argument
in
favour
of
that
foolish
topic
polygamy
,
in
his
company
and
his
niece
's
,
and
in
that
of
her
sister
and
the
Viscount
,
)
with
cautions
against
conversing
with
a
man
,
who
,
having
,
as
he
was
pleased
to
say
behind
my
back
,
married
beneath
him
,
wanted
to
engage
the
affections
of
a
lady
of
birth
,
in
order
to
recover
,
by
doubling
that
fault
upon
her
,
his
lost
reputation
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
despised
his
insinuation
enough
to
answer
him
,
that
she
thought
my
arguments
in
behalf
of
polygamy
were
convincing
.
<EOS>
This
set
him
a
raving
,
and
he
threw
some
coarse
reflections
upon
her
,
which
could
not
be
repeated
,
if
one
may
guess
at
them
,
by
her
being
unable
to
tell
me
them
;
and
then
to
vex
him
more
,
and
to
revenge
herself
,
she
said
something
like
what
was
reported
:
which
was
handle
enough
for
her
uncle
;
who
took
care
to
propagate
it
with
an
indiscretion
peculiar
to
himself
;
for
I
heard
it
in
three
different
companies
,
before
I
knew
any
thing
of
it
from
herself
;
and
when
I
did
,
it
was
so
repeated
,
as
you
,
<EOS>
my
dear
,
would
hardly
have
censured
her
for
it
,
the
provocation
considered
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Well
,
but
then
,
dear
Sir
,
there
is
nothing
at
all
amiss
,
at
this
rate
,
in
the
correspondence
between
my
lady
and
you
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Not
on
her
side
,
I
dare
say
,
if
her
ladyship
can
be
excused
to
punctilio
,
and
for
having
a
greater
esteem
for
a
married
man
,
than
he
can
deserve
,
or
than
may
be
strictly
defended
to
a
person
of
your
purity
and
niceness
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Sir
,
this
is
very
noble
in
you
.
<EOS>
I
love
to
hear
the
gentlemen
generous
in
points
where
the
honour
of
our
sex
is
concerned
.
<EOS>
But
pray
.
<EOS>
Sir
,
what
then
was
there
on
your
side
,
in
that
matter
,
that
made
you
give
me
so
patient
and
so
kind
a
hearing
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
my
dear
,
you
come
to
the
point
:
at
first
it
was
nothing
in
me
but
vanity
,
pride
,
and
love
of
intrigue
,
to
try
my
strength
,
where
I
had
met
with
some
encouragement
,
as
I
thought
,
at
the
masquerade
;
where
the
lady
went
farther
,
too
,
than
she
would
have
done
,
had
she
not
thought
I
was
a
single
man
.
<EOS>
For
,
by
what
I
have
told
you
,
Pamela
,
you
will
observe
,
that
she
tried
to
satisfy
herself
on
that
head
,
as
soon
as
she
well
could
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Nelthorpe
acquainted
me
afterwards
,
when
better
known
to
each
other
,
that
her
lady
was
so
partial
in
my
favour
,
(
who
can
always
govern
their
fancies
,
my
dear
?
)
<EOS>
as
to
think
,
so
early
as
at
the
masquerade
,
that
if
every
thing
answered
appearances
,
and
that
I
were
a
single
man
,
she
,
who
has
a
noble
and
independent
fortune
,
might
possibly
be
induced
to
make
me
happy
in
her
choice
.
  
<EOS>
"
Supposing
,
then
,
that
I
was
unmarried
,
she
left
a
signal
for
me
in
her
handkerchief
.
<EOS>
I
visited
her
;
had
the
honour
,
after
the
customary
first
shyness
,
of
being
well
received
;
and
continued
my
visits
,
till
<EOS>
,
perhaps
,
she
would
have
been
glad
I
had
not
been
married
,
but
on
finding
I
was
,
she
avoided
me
,
as
I
have
told
you
,
till
the
accident
I
mentioned
threw
us
again
upon
each
other
:
which
renewed
our
intimacy
upon
terms
you
would
think
too
inconsiderable
on
one
side
,
and
too
designing
on
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
"
For
myself
,
what
can
I
say
?
<EOS>
only
that
you
gave
me
great
disgusts
(
without
cause
,
as
I
thought
,
)
by
your
unwonted
reception
of
me
,
ever
in
tears
and
grief
;
the
Countess
ever
cheerful
and
lively
;
and
fearing
that
your
temper
was
entirely
changing
<EOS>
,
I
believe
I
had
no
bad
excuse
to
try
to
make
myself
easy
and
cheerful
abroad
,
since
my
home
became
more
irksome
to
me
than
ever
I
believed
it
could
be
.
<EOS>
Then
,
as
we
naturally
love
those
who
love
us
,
I
had
vanity
,
and
some
reason
for
my
vanity
<EOS>
(
indeed
all
vain
<EOS>
men
believe
they
have
,
)
to
think
the
Countess
had
more
than
an
indifference
for
me
.
<EOS>
She
was
so
exasperated
by
the
wrong
methods
taken
with
an
independent
lady
of
her
generous
spirit
,
to
break
off
our
acquaintance
,
that
,
in
revenge
,
she
denied
me
less
than
ever
opportunities
of
her
company
.
<EOS>
The
pleasure
we
took
in
each
other
's
conversation
was
reciprocal
.
<EOS>
The
world
's
reports
had
united
us
in
one
common
cause
:
and
you
,
as
I
said
,
had
made
home
less
delightful
to
me
than
it
used
to
be
:
what
might
not
then
have
been
apprehended
from
so
many
circumstances
concurring
with
the
lady
's
beauty
and
my
frailty
?
  
<EOS>
"
I
waited
on
her
to
Tunbridge
.
<EOS>
She
took
a
house
there
.
<EOS>
Where
people
's
tongues
will
take
so
much
liberty
,
without
any
foundation
,
and
where
the
utmost
circumspection
is
used
,
what
will
they
not
say
,
where
so
little
of
the
latter
is
observed
?
<EOS>
No
wonder
,
then
,
that
terms
were
said
to
be
agreed
upon
between
us
:
from
her
uncle
's
story
,
of
polygamy
proposed
by
me
,
and
seemingly
agreed
to
by
her
,
no
wonder
that
all
your
Thomasine
Fuller
's
information
was
surmised
.
<EOS>
Thus
stood
the
matter
,
when
I
was
determined
to
give
your
cause
for
uneasiness
a
hearing
,
and
to
take
my
measures
according
to
what
should
result
from
that
hearing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
From
this
account
,
dear
Sir
,
"
said
I
,
"
it
will
not
be
so
difficult
,
as
I
feared
,
to
end
this
affair
even
to
her
ladyship
's
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
hope
not
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
if
,
now
,
Sir
,
the
Countess
should
still
be
desirous
not
to
break
with
you
;
from
so
charming
a
lady
,
who
knows
what
may
happen
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
true
,
Pamela
;
but
to
make
you
still
easier
,
I
will
tell
you
that
her
ladyship
has
a
first
cousin
married
to
a
person
going
with
a
public
character
to
several
of
the
Italian
courts
,
and
,
had
it
not
been
for
my
persuasions
,
she
would
have
accepted
of
their
earnest
invitations
,
and
passed
a
year
or
two
in
Italy
,
where
she
once
resided
for
three
years
together
,
which
makes
her
so
perfect
a
mistress
of
Italian
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
I
will
let
her
know
,
additionally
to
what
I
have
written
to
her
,
the
uneasiness
I
have
given
you
,
and
,
so
far
as
it
is
proper
,
what
is
come
to
your
ears
,
and
your
generous
account
of
her
,
and
the
charms
of
her
person
,
of
which
she
will
not
be
a
little
proud
;
for
she
has
really
noble
and
generous
sentiments
,
and
thinks
well
(
though
her
sister
,
in
pleasantry
,
will
have
it
a
little
enviously
,
)
of
you
;
and
when
I
shall
endeavour
to
persuade
her
to
go
,
for
the
sake
of
her
own
character
,
to
a
place
and
country
of
which
she
was
always
fond
,
I
am
apt
to
think
she
will
come
into
it
;
for
she
has
a
greater
opinion
of
my
judgment
than
it
deserves
:
and
I
know
a
young
lord
,
who
may
be
easily
persuaded
to
follow
her
thither
,
and
bring
her
back
his
lady
,
if
he
can
obtain
her
consent
:
<EOS>
and
what
say
you
,
Pamela
,
to
this
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
O
,
Sir
!
<EOS>
I
believe
I
shall
begin
to
love
the
lady
dearly
,
and
that
is
what
I
never
thought
I
should
.
<EOS>
I
hope
this
will
be
brought
about
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
see
,
give
me
leave
to
say
,
Sir
,
how
dangerously
you
might
both
have
gone
on
,
under
the
notion
of
this
Platonic
love
,
till
two
precious
souls
had
been
lost
:
and
this
shews
one
,
as
well
in
spirituals
as
temporals
,
from
what
slight
beginnings
the
greatest
mischiefs
sometimes
spring
;
and
how
easily
at
first
a
breach
may
be
stopped
,
that
,
when
neglected
,
the
waves
of
passion
will
widen
till
they
bear
down
all
before
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Your
observation
,
my
dear
,
is
just
,
"
replied
Mr.
B.
,
"
and
though
,
I
am
confident
the
lady
was
more
in
earnest
than
myself
in
the
notion
of
Platonic
love
,
yet
I
am
convinced
,
and
always
was
,
that
Platonic
love
is
Platonic
nonsense
:
'
<EOS>
tis
the
fly
buzzing
about
the
blaze
,
till
its
wings
are
scorched
;
or
,
to
speak
still
stronger
,
it
is
a
bait
of
the
devil
to
catch
the
unexperienced
,
and
thoughtless
:
nor
ought
such
notions
to
be
pretended
to
,
till
the
parties
are
five
or
ten
years
on
the
other
side
of
their
grand
climateric
:
for
age
,
old
age
,
and
nothing
else
,
must
establish
the
barriers
to
Platonic
love
.
<EOS>
But
this
was
my
comparative
consolation
,
though
a
very
bad
one
,
that
had
I
swerved
<EOS>
,
I
should
not
have
given
the
only
instance
,
where
persons
more
scrupulous
than
I
pretended
to
be
,
have
begun
friendships
even
with
spiritual
views
,
and
ended
them
as
grossly
as
I
could
have
done
,
were
the
lady
to
have
been
as
frail
as
her
tempter
.
"
  
<EOS>
Here
Mr.
B.
finished
his
narrative
.
<EOS>
He
is
now
set
out
for
Tunbridge
with
all
my
papers
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
doubt
in
his
honour
and
kind
assurances
,
and
hope
my
next
will
be
a
joyful
letter
;
and
that
I
shall
inform
you
in
it
,
that
the
affair
which
went
so
near
my
heart
,
is
absolutely
concluded
to
my
satisfaction
,
to
Mr.
B.
's
and
the
Countess
's
;
for
if
it
be
so
to
all
three
,
my
happiness
<EOS>
,
I
doubt
not
,
will
be
founded
on
a
permanent
basis
.
<EOS>
Meantime
I
am
,
my
dear
good
lady
,
your
most
affectionate
,
and
obliged
sister
and
servant
,
  
<EOS>
P.B.
    
A
new
misfortune
,
my
dear
lady
!
 
<EOS>
But
this
is
of
God
Almighty
's
sending
;
so
I
must
bear
it
patiently
.
<EOS>
My
dear
baby
is
taken
with
the
small
-
pox
!
 
<EOS>
To
how
many
troubles
are
the
happiest
of
us
subjected
in
this
life
!
<EOS>
One
need
not
multiply
them
by
one
's
own
wilful
mismanagements
!
 
<EOS>
I
am
able
to
mind
nothing
else
!
  
<EOS>
I
had
so
much
joy
(
as
I
told
your
ladyship
in
the
beginning
of
my
last
letter
but
one
)
to
see
,
on
our
arrival
at
the
farm
-
house
,
my
dearest
Mr.
B.
,
my
beloved
baby
,
and
my
good
parents
,
all
upon
one
happy
spot
,
<EOS>
that
I
fear
I
was
too
proud
 
<EOS>
Yet
I
was
truly
thankful
,
I
am
sure
!
 
<EOS>
But
I
had
,
notwithstanding
too
much
pride
,
and
too
much
pleasure
,
on
this
happy
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
I
said
,
in
my
last
,
that
your
dear
brother
set
out
on
Tuesday
morning
for
Tunbridge
with
my
papers
;
and
I
longed
to
know
the
result
,
hoping
that
every
thing
would
be
concluded
to
the
satisfaction
of
all
three
:
"
For
,
"
thought
I
,
"
if
this
be
so
,
my
happiness
must
be
permanent
:
"
<EOS>
but
alas
!
<EOS>
there
is
nothing
permanent
in
this
life
.
<EOS>
I
feel
it
by
experience
now
!
 
<EOS>
I
knew
it
before
by
theory
:
but
that
was
not
so
near
and
interesting
by
half
.
  
<EOS>
For
,
with
all
my
pleasures
and
hopes
;
in
the
midst
of
my
dear
parents
'
joy
and
congratulations
on
our
arrival
,
and
on
what
had
passed
so
happily
since
we
were
last
here
together
,
(
in
the
birth
of
the
dear
child
,
and
my
safety
,
for
which
they
had
been
so
apprehensive
,
)
the
poor
baby
was
taken
ill
.
<EOS>
It
was
on
that
very
Tuesday
his
papa
set
out
for
Tunbridge
;
but
we
knew
not
it
would
be
the
small
-
pox
till
Thursday
.
<EOS>
O
Madam
!
<EOS>
how
are
all
the
pleasures
I
had
formed
to
myself
sickened
now
upon
me
!
<EOS>
for
my
Billy
is
very
bad
.
  
<EOS>
They
talk
of
a
kind
sort
:
<EOS>
but
alas
:
they
talk
at
random
:
for
they
come
not
out
at
all
!
 
<EOS>
I
fear
the
nurse
's
constitution
is
too
hale
and
too
rich
for
the
dear
baby
!
 
<EOS>
Had
I
been
permitted
 
But
hush
,
all
my
repining
ifs
!
 
<EOS>
except
one
if
;
and
that
is
,
if
it
be
got
happily
over
,
it
will
be
best
he
had
it
so
young
,
and
while
at
the
breast
!
    
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
Madam
,
Madam
!
<EOS>
the
small
appearance
that
there
was
is
gone
in
again
:
and
my
child
,
my
dear
baby
,
will
die
!
<EOS>
The
doctors
seem
to
think
so
.
  
<EOS>
They
wanted
to
send
for
Mr.
B.
to
keep
me
from
him
!
 
<EOS>
But
I
forbid
it
!
 
<EOS>
For
what
signifies
life
,
or
any
thing
,
if
I
can
not
see
my
baby
,
while
he
is
so
dangerously
ill
!
  
<EOS>
My
father
and
mother
are
,
for
the
first
time
,
quite
cruel
to
me
;
they
have
forbid
me
,
and
I
never
was
so
desirous
of
disobeying
them
before
,
to
attend
the
darling
of
my
heart
:
and
why
?
 
<EOS>
For
fear
of
this
poor
face
!
 
<EOS>
For
fear
I
should
get
it
myself
!
 
<EOS>
But
I
am
living
very
low
,
and
have
taken
proper
precautions
by
bleeding
,
and
the
like
,
to
lessen
the
distemper
's
fury
,
if
I
should
have
it
;
and
the
rest
I
leave
to
Providence
.
<EOS>
And
if
Mr.
B.
's
value
is
confined
so
much
to
this
poor
transitory
sightliness
,
he
must
not
break
with
his
Countess
,
I
think
;
and
if
I
am
ever
so
deformed
in
person
,
my
poor
intellects
,
I
hope
will
not
be
impaired
,
and
I
shall
,
if
God
spare
my
Billy
,
be
useful
in
his
first
education
,
and
be
helpful
to
dear
Miss
Goodwin
 
or
to
any
babies
 
with
all
my
heart
 
<EOS>
he
may
make
me
an
humble
nurse
too
!
 
<EOS>
How
peevish
,
sinfully
so
,
I
doubt
,
does
this
accident
,
and
their
affectionate
contradiction
,
make
one
!
  
<EOS>
I
have
this
moment
received
the
following
from
Mr.
B.
  
Maidstone
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dearest
love
,
  
"
I
am
greatly
touched
with
the
dear
boy
's
malady
,
of
which
I
have
this
moment
heard
.
<EOS>
I
desire
you
instantly
to
come
to
me
hither
,
in
the
chariot
with
the
bearer
,
Colbrand
.
<EOS>
I
know
what
your
grief
must
be
:
<EOS>
but
as
you
can
do
the
child
<EOS>
no
good
<EOS>
,
I
beg
you
'll
oblige
me
.
<EOS>
Everything
is
in
a
happy
train
;
but
I
can
think
only
of
you
,
and
(
for
your
sake
principally
,
but
not
a
little
for
my
own
)
<EOS>
my
boy
.
<EOS>
I
will
set
out
to
meet
you
;
for
I
choose
not
to
come
myself
,
lest
you
should
try
to
persuade
me
to
permit
your
tarrying
about
him
;
and
I
should
be
sorry
to
deny
you
any
thing
.
<EOS>
I
have
taken
handsome
apartments
for
you
,
till
the
event
,
which
I
pray
God
may
be
happy
,
shall
better
determinate
me
what
to
do
.
<EOS>
I
will
be
ever
your
affectionate
and
faithful
.
"
  
<EOS>
Maidstone
indeed
is
not
so
very
far
off
,
but
one
may
hear
every
day
,
once
or
twice
,
by
a
man
and
horse
;
so
I
will
go
,
<EOS>
to
shew
my
obedience
,
since
Mr.
B.
is
so
intent
upon
it
 
<EOS>
But
I
can
not
live
,
if
I
am
not
permitted
to
come
back
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
let
me
be
enabled
,
gracious
Father
!
<EOS>
to
close
this
letter
more
happily
than
I
have
begun
it
!
  
<EOS>
I
have
been
so
dreadfully
uneasy
at
Maidstone
,
that
Mr.
B.
has
been
so
good
as
to
return
with
me
hither
;
and
I
find
my
baby
's
case
not
yet
quite
desperate
 
<EOS>
I
am
easier
<EOS>
now
I
see
him
,
in
presence
of
his
beloved
papa
who
lets
me
<EOS>
have
all
my
way
,
and
approves
of
my
preparative
method
for
myself
;
and
he
tells
me
that
since
I
will
have
it
so
,
he
will
indulge
me
in
my
attendance
on
the
child
,
and
endeavour
to
imitate
my
reliance
on
God
 
that
is
his
kind
expression
 
and
leave
the
issue
to
him
.
<EOS>
And
on
my
telling
him
,
that
I
feared
nothing
in
the
distemper
,
but
the
loss
of
his
love
,
he
said
,
in
presence
of
the
doctors
,
and
my
father
and
mother
,
pressing
my
hand
to
his
lips
 
<EOS>
"
My
dearest
life
,
make
yourself
easy
under
this
affliction
,
and
apprehend
nothing
for
yourself
:
I
love
you
more
,
for
your
mind
than
for
your
face
.
<EOS>
That
and
your
person
will
be
the
same
;
and
were
that
sweet
face
to
be
covered
with
seams
and
scars
,
I
will
value
you
the
more
for
the
misfortune
:
and
glad
I
am
,
that
I
had
your
picture
so
well
drawn
in
town
,
to
satisfy
those
who
have
heard
of
your
loveliness
,
what
you
were
,
and
hitherto
are
.
<EOS>
For
myself
,
my
admiration
lies
deeper
;
"
and
,
drawing
me
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
,
whisperingly
he
said
,
"
The
last
uneasiness
between
us
,
I
now
begin
to
think
,
was
necessary
,
because
it
has
turned
all
my
delight
in
you
,
more
than
ever
,
to
the
perfections
of
your
mind
:
and
so
God
preserves
to
me
the
life
of
my
Pamela
<EOS>
,
I
care
not
for
my
own
part
,
what
ravages
the
distemper
makes
here
,
"
and
tapped
my
cheek
.
 
<EOS>
How
generous
,
how
noble
,
how
comforting
was
this
!
  
<EOS>
When
I
went
from
my
apartment
,
to
go
to
my
child
,
my
dear
Mr.
B.
met
me
at
the
nursery
door
,
and
led
me
back
again
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
not
go
in
again
,
my
dearest
.
<EOS>
They
have
just
been
giving
the
child
other
things
to
try
to
drive
out
the
malady
;
and
some
pustules
seem
to
promise
on
his
breast
.
<EOS>
"
I
made
no
doubt
,
my
baby
was
then
in
extremity
;
and
I
would
have
given
the
world
to
have
shed
a
few
tears
,
but
I
could
not
.
  
<EOS>
With
the
most
soothing
goodness
he
led
me
to
my
desk
,
and
withdrew
to
attend
the
dear
baby
himself
 
to
see
his
last
gaspings
,
poor
little
lamb
<EOS>
,
I
make
no
doubt
!
  
<EOS>
In
this
suspense
,
my
own
strange
hardness
of
heart
would
not
give
up
one
tear
,
for
the
passage
from
that
to
<EOS>
my
eyes
seemed
quite
choaked
up
,
which
used
to
be
so
open
and
ready
on
other
occasions
,
affecting
ones
too
.
  
<EOS>
Two
days
have
passed
,
dreadful
days
of
suspense
:
and
now
,
blessed
be
God
!
<EOS>
who
has
given
me
hope
that
our
prayers
are
heard
,
the
pustules
come
kindly
out
,
very
thick
in
his
breast
,
and
on
his
face
:
but
of
a
good
sort
,
they
tell
me
.
 
<EOS>
They
wo
n't
let
me
see
him
;
indeed
they
wo
n't
!
 
<EOS>
What
cruel
kindness
is
this
!
<EOS>
One
must
believe
all
they
tell
one
!
  
<EOS>
But
,
my
dear
lady
,
my
spirits
are
so
weak
;
I
have
such
a
violent
headache
,
and
have
such
a
strange
shivering
disorder
all
running
down
my
back
,
and
I
was
so
hot
just
now
,
and
am
so
cold
at
this
present
 
<EOS>
aguishly
inclined
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
how
!
<EOS>
that
I
must
leave
off
,
the
post
going
away
,
with
the
assurance
,
that
I
am
,
and
will
be
,
to
the
last
hour
of
my
life
,
your
ladyship
's
grateful
and
obliged
sister
and
servant
,
  
P.B.
    
From
Mr.
B.
to
Lady
Davers
.
  
<EOS>
MY
DEAR
SISTER
,
  
<EOS>
I
take
very
kindly
your
solicitude
for
the
health
of
my
beloved
Pamela
.
<EOS>
The
last
line
she
wrote
was
to
you
,
for
she
took
to
her
bed
the
moment
she
laid
down
her
pen
.
  
<EOS>
I
told
her
your
kind
message
,
and
wishes
for
her
safety
,
by
my
lord
's
gentleman
;
and
she
begged
I
would
write
a
line
to
thank
you
in
her
name
for
your
affectionate
regards
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
She
is
in
a
fine
way
to
do
well
:
for
with
her
accustomed
prudence
,
she
had
begun
to
prepare
herself
by
a
proper
regimen
,
the
moment
she
knew
<EOS>
the
child
's
illness
was
the
small
-
pox
.
  
<EOS>
The
worst
is
over
with
the
boy
,
which
keeps
up
her
spirits
;
and
her
mother
is
so
excellent
a
nurse
to
both
,
and
we
are
so
happy
likewise
in
the
care
of
a
skilful
physician
,
Dr.
M.
(
who
directs
and
approves
of
every
thing
the
good
dame
does
,
)
that
it
is
a
singular
providence
this
malady
seized
them
here
;
and
affords
no
small
comfort
to
the
dear
creature
herself
.
  
<EOS>
When
I
tell
you
,
that
,
to
all
appearance
,
her
charming
face
will
not
receive
any
disfigurement
by
this
cruel
enemy
to
beauty
,
I
am
sure
you
will
congratulate
me
upon
a
felicity
so
desirable
:
but
were
it
to
be
otherwise
,
if
I
were
capable
of
slighting
a
person
,
whose
principal
beauties
are
much
deeper
than
the
skin
,
I
should
deserve
to
be
thought
the
most
unworthy
and
superficial
of
husbands
.
  
<EOS>
Whatever
your
notions
have
been
,
my
ever
-
ready
censuring
Lady
Davers
,
of
your
brother
,
on
a
certain
affair
,
I
do
assure
you
,
that
I
never
did
,
and
never
can
,
love
any
woman
as
I
love
my
Pamela
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
indeed
impossible
I
can
ever
love
her
better
than
I
do
;
and
her
outward
beauties
are
far
from
being
indifferent
to
me
;
yet
,
if
I
know
myself
,
I
am
sure
I
have
justice
enough
to
love
her
equally
,
and
generosity
enough
to
be
more
tender
of
her
,
were
she
to
suffer
by
this
distemper
.
<EOS>
But
,
as
her
humility
,
and
her
affection
to
me
,
would
induce
her
to
think
herself
under
greater
obligation
to
me
,
for
such
my
tenderness
to
her
,
were
she
to
lose
any
the
least
valuable
of
her
perfections
,
I
rejoice
that
she
will
have
no
reason
for
mortification
on
that
score
.
  
<EOS>
My
respects
to
Lord
Davers
,
and
your
noble
neighbours
.
<EOS>
I
am
,
your
affectionate
brother
,
and
humble
servant
.
    
<EOS>
From
Lady
Davers
,
in
answer
to
the
preceding
.
  
<EOS>
MY
DEAR
BROTHER
,
  
I
do
most
heartily
congratulate
you
on
the
recovery
of
Master
Billy
,
and
the
good
way
my
sister
is
in
.
<EOS>
I
am
the
more
rejoiced
,
as
her
sweet
face
is
not
like
to
suffer
by
the
malady
;
for
,
be
the
beauties
of
the
mind
<EOS>
what
they
will
,
those
of
the
person
are
no
small
recommendation
,
with
some
folks
<EOS>
,
I
am
sure
;
and
I
began
to
be
afraid
,
that
when
it
was
hardly
possible
for
both
conjoined
to
keep
a
roving
mind
constant
,
that
one
only
would
not
be
sufficient
.
  
<EOS>
This
news
gives
me
more
pleasure
,
because
I
am
well
informed
,
that
a
certain
gay
lady
was
pleased
to
give
herself
airs
upon
learning
of
my
sister
's
illness
,
as
,
That
she
would
not
be
sorry
for
it
;
for
now
she
should
look
upon
herself
as
the
prettiest
woman
in
England
.
 
<EOS>
She
meant
only
,
I
suppose
,
as
to
outward
prettiness
,
brother
!
  
<EOS>
You
give
me
the
name
of
a
ready
censurer
.
<EOS>
I
own
,
I
think
myself
to
be
not
a
little
interested
in
all
that
regards
my
brother
,
and
his
honour
.
<EOS>
But
when
some
people
are
not
readier
to
censure
,
than
others
to
trespass
,
I
know
not
whether
they
can
with
justice
be
styled
censorious
.
  
<EOS>
But
however
that
be
,
the
rod
seems
to
have
been
held
up
,
as
a
warning
 
and
that
the
blow
,
in
the
irreparable
deprivation
,
is
not
given
,
<EOS>
is
a
mercy
,
which
I
hope
will
be
deserved
;
though
you
never
can
those
very
signal
ones
you
receive
at
the
Divine
hands
,
beyond
any
man
I
know
.
<EOS>
For
even
(
if
I
shall
not
be
deemed
censorious
again
)
<EOS>
your
very
vices
have
been
turned
to
your
felicity
,
as
if
God
would
try
the
nobleness
of
the
heart
he
has
given
you
,
by
overcoming
you
(
in
answer
to
my
sister
's
constant
prayers
,
as
well
as
mine
)
by
mercies
rather
than
by
judgments
.
  
<EOS>
I
might
give
instances
of
the
truth
of
this
observation
,
in
almost
all
the
actions
and
attempts
of
your
past
life
;
and
take
care
<EOS>
(
if
you
are
displeased
,
I
will
speak
it
)
,
take
care
,
thou
bold
wretch
,
that
if
this
method
be
ungratefully
slighted
,
the
uplifted
arm
fall
not
down
with
double
weight
on
thy
devoted
head
!
  
<EOS>
I
must
always
love
and
honour
my
brother
,
but
can
not
help
speaking
my
mind
:
which
,
after
all
,
is
the
natural
result
of
that
very
love
and
honour
,
and
which
obliges
me
to
style
myself
your
truly
affectionate
sister
,
  
B.
Davers
.
    
<EOS>
From
Mrs.
B.
to
Lady
Davers
.
  
<EOS>
MY
DEAREST
LADY
,
  
<EOS>
My
first
letter
,
and
my
first
devoirs
,
after
those
of
thankfulness
to
that
gracious
God
,
who
has
so
happily
conducted
me
through
two
such
heavy
trials
,
as
my
child
's
and
my
own
illness
,
must
be
directed
to
you
,
with
all
due
acknowledgment
of
your
generous
and
affectionate
concern
for
me
.
  
<EOS>
We
are
now
preparing
for
our
journey
to
Bedfordshire
;
and
there
,
to
my
great
satisfaction
,
I
am
to
be
favoured
with
the
care
of
Miss
Goodwin
.
  
<EOS>
After
tarrying
about
a
month
there
,
Mr.
B.
will
make
a
tour
with
me
through
several
counties
(
taking
the
Hall
in
the
way
)
for
about
a
fortnight
,
and
shew
me
what
is
remarkable
,
every
where
as
we
pass
;
for
this
,
he
thinks
,
will
better
contribute
to
my
health
,
than
any
other
method
.
<EOS>
The
distemper
has
left
upon
me
a
kind
of
weariness
and
listlessness
;
and
he
proposes
to
be
out
with
me
till
the
Bath
season
begins
;
and
by
the
aid
of
those
healing
and
balsamic
waters
,
he
hopes
,
I
shall
be
quite
established
.
<EOS>
Afterwards
to
return
to
Bedfordshire
for
a
little
while
;
then
to
London
;
and
then
to
Kent
;
and
,
if
nothing
hinders
,
has
a
great
mind
to
carry
me
over
to
Paris
.
  
<EOS>
Thus
most
kindly
does
he
amuse
and
divert
me
with
his
agreeable
proposals
.
<EOS>
But
I
have
made
one
amendment
to
them
;
and
that
is
,
that
I
must
not
be
denied
to
pay
my
respects
to
your
ladyship
,
at
your
seat
,
and
to
my
good
Lady
Countess
in
the
same
neighbourhood
,
and
this
will
be
far
from
being
the
least
of
my
pleasures
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
had
congratulations
without
number
upon
my
recovery
;
but
one
,
among
the
rest
,
I
did
not
expect
;
from
the
Countess
Dowager
(
could
you
think
it
,
Madam
?
)
<EOS>
who
sent
me
by
her
gentleman
the
following
letter
from
Tunbridge
.
  
<EOS>
"
MADAM
,
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
,
among
the
congratulations
of
your
numerous
admirers
,
on
your
happy
recovery
,
my
very
sincere
ones
will
not
be
unacceptable
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
other
motive
for
making
you
my
compliments
on
this
occasion
,
on
so
slender
an
acquaintance
,
than
the
pleasure
it
gives
me
,
that
the
public
,
as
well
as
your
private
friends
,
have
not
been
deprived
of
a
lady
whose
example
,
in
every
duty
of
life
,
is
of
so
much
concern
to
both
.
 
<EOS>
May
you
,
Madam
,
long
rejoice
in
an
uninterrupted
state
of
happiness
,
answerable
to
your
merits
,
and
to
your
own
wishes
,
are
those
of
your
most
obedient
humble
servant
.
"
  
<EOS>
To
this
kind
letter
I
returned
the
following
:
  
"
MADAM
,
  
"
<EOS>
I
am
under
the
highest
obligation
to
your
generous
favour
,
in
your
kind
compliments
of
congratulation
on
my
recovery
.
<EOS>
There
is
something
so
noble
and
so
condescending
in
the
honour
you
have
done
me
,
on
so
slender
an
acquaintance
,
that
it
bespeaks
the
exalted
mind
and
character
of
a
lady
,
who
,
in
the
principles
of
generosity
,
and
in
true
nobleness
of
nature
,
has
no
example
.
<EOS>
May
God
Almighty
bless
you
,
my
dear
lady
,
with
all
the
good
you
wish
me
,
and
with
increase
of
honour
and
glory
,
both
here
and
hereafter
,
prays
,
and
will
always
pray
,
your
ladyship
's
most
obliged
and
obedient
servant
,
P.B.
"
  
<EOS>
This
leads
me
to
mention
,
what
my
illness
would
not
permit
me
to
do
before
,
that
Mr.
B.
met
with
such
a
reception
and
audience
from
the
Countess
,
when
he
attended
her
,
in
all
he
had
to
offer
and
propose
to
her
,
and
in
her
patient
hearing
of
what
he
thought
fit
to
read
her
,
from
your
ladyship
's
letters
and
mine
,
that
he
said
,
"
Do
n't
be
jealous
,
my
dear
Pamela
;
but
I
must
admire
her
as
long
as
I
live
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
gave
me
the
particulars
,
so
much
to
her
ladyship
's
honour
,
that
I
told
him
,
he
should
not
only
be
welcome
to
admire
her
ladyship
,
but
that
I
would
admire
her
too
.
  
<EOS>
They
parted
very
good
friends
,
and
with
great
professions
of
esteem
for
each
other
.
 
<EOS>
And
as
Mr.
B.
had
undertaken
to
inspect
into
some
exceptionable
accounts
and
managements
of
her
ladyship
's
bailiff
,
one
of
her
servants
brought
a
letter
for
him
on
Monday
last
,
wholly
written
on
that
subject
.
<EOS>
But
she
was
so
considerate
,
as
to
send
it
unsealed
,
in
a
cover
directed
to
me
.
<EOS>
When
I
opened
it
,
I
was
frightened
to
see
it
begin
to
Mr.
B.
<EOS>
and
I
hastened
to
find
him
 
<EOS>
"
Dear
Sir
 
<EOS>
Here
's
some
mistake
 
<EOS>
You
see
the
direction
is
to
Mrs.
B.
 
"
Tis
very
plain
 
<EOS>
But
,
upon
my
word
,
I
have
not
read
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
"
Do
n't
be
uneasy
,
my
love
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
what
the
subject
must
be
;
but
I
dare
swear
there
is
nothing
,
nor
will
there
ever
be
,
but
what
you
or
any
body
may
see
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
read
it
,
and
giving
it
to
me
,
said
,
"
Answer
yourself
the
postscript
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
That
was
 
"
<EOS>
If
,
Sir
,
the
trouble
I
give
you
,
is
likely
to
subject
you
or
your
lady
to
uneasiness
or
apprehensions
,
I
beg
you
will
not
be
concerned
in
it
.
<EOS>
I
will
then
set
about
the
matter
myself
;
for
my
uncle
I
will
not
trouble
;
yet
women
enter
into
these
particulars
with
as
little
advantage
to
themselves
as
inclination
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
told
him
,
I
was
entirely
easy
and
unapprehensive
;
and
,
after
all
his
goodness
to
me
,
should
be
so
,
if
he
saw
the
Countess
every
day
.
<EOS>
"
That
's
kindly
said
,
my
dear
;
but
I
will
not
trust
myself
to
see
her
every
day
,
or
at
all
,
for
the
present
.
<EOS>
But
I
shall
be
obliged
to
correspond
with
her
for
a
month
or
so
,
on
this
occasion
;
unless
you
prohibit
it
;
and
it
shall
be
in
your
power
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
said
,
with
my
whole
heart
,
he
might
;
and
I
should
be
quite
easy
in
both
their
honours
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yet
I
will
not
,
"
said
he
,
"
unless
you
see
our
letters
<EOS>
:
for
I
know
she
will
always
,
now
she
has
begun
,
send
in
a
cover
to
you
,
what
she
will
write
to
me
,
unsealed
;
and
whether
I
am
at
home
or
abroad
,
I
shall
take
it
unkindly
,
if
you
do
not
read
them
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
went
in
,
and
wrote
an
answer
,
which
he
sent
by
the
messenger
;
but
would
make
me
,
whether
I
would
or
not
,
read
it
,
and
seal
it
up
with
his
seal
.
<EOS>
But
all
this
needed
not
to
me
now
,
who
think
so
much
better
of
the
lady
than
I
did
before
;
and
am
so
well
satisfied
in
his
own
honour
and
generous
affection
for
me
;
for
you
saw
,
Madam
,
in
what
I
wrote
before
,
that
he
always
loved
me
,
though
he
was
angry
at
times
,
at
my
change
of
temper
,
as
he
feared
,
not
knowing
that
I
was
apprised
of
what
had
passed
between
him
and
the
Countess
.
  
<EOS>
I
really
am
better
pleased
with
his
correspondence
,
than
I
should
have
been
,
had
it
not
been
carried
on
;
because
the
servants
,
on
both
sides
,
will
see
,
by
my
deportment
on
the
occasion
(
and
I
will
officiously
,
with
a
smiling
countenance
,
throw
myself
in
their
observation
)
,
that
it
is
quite
innocent
;
and
this
may
help
to
silence
the
mouths
of
those
who
have
so
freely
censured
their
conduct
.
  
<EOS>
Indeed
,
Madam
,
I
think
I
have
received
no
small
good
myself
by
that
affair
,
which
once
lay
so
heavy
upon
me
:
for
I
do
n't
believe
I
shall
be
ever
jealous
again
;
indeed
I
do
n't
think
I
shall
.
<EOS>
And
wo
n't
that
be
an
ugly
foible
overcome
?
<EOS>
I
see
what
may
be
done
,
in
cases
not
favourable
to
our
wishes
,
by
the
aid
of
proper
reflection
;
and
that
the
bee
is
not
the
only
creature
that
may
make
honey
out
of
the
bitter
flowers
as
well
as
the
sweet
.
  
<EOS>
My
most
grateful
respects
and
thanks
to
my
good
Lord
Davers
;
to
the
Earl
,
and
his
excellent
Countess
;
and
most
particularly
to
Lady
Betty
(
with
whose
kind
compliments
your
ladyship
acquaints
me
)
,
and
to
Mr.
H.
for
all
your
united
congratulations
on
my
recovery
.
<EOS>
What
obligations
do
I
lie
under
to
such
noble
and
generous
well
-
wishers
!
 
<EOS>
I
can
make
no
return
but
by
my
prayers
,
that
God
,
by
his
goodness
,
will
supply
all
my
defects
.
<EOS>
And
these
will
always
attend
you
,
from
,
my
dearest
lady
,
your
ever
obliged
sister
,
and
humble
servant
,
  
<EOS>
P.B.
  
Mr.
H.
is
just
arrived
.
<EOS>
He
says
,
he
comes
a
special
messenger
,
to
make
a
report
how
my
face
has
come
off
.
<EOS>
He
makes
me
many
compliments
upon
it
.
<EOS>
How
kind
your
ladyship
is
,
to
enter
so
favourably
into
the
minutest
concerns
,
which
you
think
,
may
any
way
affect
my
future
happiness
in
your
dear
brother
's
opinion
!
 
<EOS>
I
want
to
pour
out
all
my
joy
and
my
thankfulness
to
God
,
before
you
,
and
the
good
Countess
of

For
I
am
a
happy

yea

a
blessed
creature

Mr.
B.
's
boy

your
ladyship

boy
,
and
my
boy

is
charmingly
well
;
quite
strong

and
very
forward

for
his
months

his

is
delighted
with
him
more
and
more

<EOS>
MY
DEAR
MISS
DARNFORD
,
  
<EOS>
I
hope
you
are
happy
and
<EOS>
well
.
<EOS>
You
kindly
say
you
ca
n't
be
so
,
till
you
hear
of
my
perfect
recovery
.
<EOS>
And
this
,
blessed
be
God
!
<EOS>
you
have
heard
already
from
Mr.
B.
  
As
to
your
intimation
of
the
fair
Nun
,
'
tis
all
happily
over
.
<EOS>
Blessed
be
God
for
that
too
!
<EOS>
And
I
have
a
better
and
more
endearing
husband
than
ever
.
<EOS>
Did
you
think
that
could
be
?
  
<EOS>
My
Billy
too
improves
daily
,
and
my
dear
parents
seem
to
have
their
youth
renewed
like
the
eagle
's
.
<EOS>
How
many
blessings
have
I
to
be
thankful
for
!
  
<EOS>
We
are
about
to
turn
travellers
,
to
the
northern
counties
.
<EOS>
I
think
quite
to
the
borders
:
and
afterwards
to
the
western
,
to
Bath
,
Bristol
,
<EOS>
and
I
know
not
whither
myself
:
<EOS>
but
among
the
rest
,
to
Lincolnshire
,
that
you
may
be
sure
of
.
<EOS>
Then
how
happy
shall
I
be
in
my
dear
Miss
Darnford
!
  
<EOS>
I
long
to
hear
whether
poor
Mrs.
Jewkes
is
better
or
worse
for
the
advice
of
the
doctor
,
whom
I
ordered
to
attend
her
from
Stamford
,
and
in
what
frame
her
mind
is
.
<EOS>
Do
vouchsafe
her
a
visit
in
my
name
;
tell
her
,
if
she
be
low
spirited
,
what
God
hath
done
for
me
,
as
to
my
recovery
,
and
comfort
her
all
you
can
;
and
bid
her
spare
neither
expence
nor
attendance
,
nor
any
thing
her
heart
can
wish
for
;
nor
the
company
of
any
relations
or
friends
she
may
desire
to
be
with
her
.
  
<EOS>
If
she
is
in
her
last
stage
,
poor
soul
!
<EOS>
how
noble
will
it
be
in
you
to
give
her
comfort
and
consolation
in
her
dying
hours
!
<EOS>
Although
we
can
merit
nothing
at
the
hand
of
God
,
yet
I
have
a
notion
,
that
we
can
not
deserve
more
of
one
another
,
and
in
some
sense
,
for
that
reason
,
of
him
,
than
in
our
charities
on
so
trying
an
exigence
!
<EOS>
When
the
poor
soul
stands
shivering
,
as
it
were
,
on
the
verge
of
death
,
and
has
nothing
strong
,
but
its
fears
and
doubts
;
then
a
little
balm
poured
into
the
wounds
of
the
mind
,
a
little
comforting
advice
to
rely
on
God
's
mercies
,
from
a
good
person
<EOS>
,
how
consolatory
must
it
be
!
<EOS>
And
how
,
like
morning
mists
before
the
sun
,
must
all
diffidences
and
gloomy
doubts
,
be
chased
away
by
it
!
  
<EOS>
But
,
my
dear
,
the
great
occasion
of
my
writing
to
you
just
now
,
is
by
Lady
Davers
's
desire
,
on
a
quite
different
subject
.
<EOS>
She
knows
how
we
love
one
another
.
<EOS>
And
she
has
sent
me
the
following
lines
by
her
kinsman
,
who
came
to
Kent
,
purposely
to
enquire
how
my
face
fared
in
the
small
-
pox
;
and
accompanied
us
hither
,
[
i.e.
to
Bedfordshire
,
]
and
sets
out
to
-
morrow
for
Lord
Davers
's
.
  
<EOS>
"
MY
DEAR
PAMELA
,
  
"
Jackey
will
tell
you
the
reason
of
his
journey
,
my
curiosity
on
your
own
account
;
and
I
send
this
letter
by
him
,
but
he
knows
not
the
contents
.
<EOS>
My
good
Lord
Davers
wants
to
have
his
nephew
married
,
and
settled
in
the
world
:
and
his
noble
father
leaves
the
whole
matter
to
my
lord
,
as
to
the
person
,
settlements
,
&
c.
<EOS>
Now
I
,
as
well
as
he
,
think
so
highly
of
the
prudence
,
the
person
,
and
family
of
your
Miss
Darnford
,
that
we
shall
be
obliged
to
you
,
to
sound
the
young
lady
on
this
score
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
Mr.
H.
would
wish
for
no
greater
happiness
.
<EOS>
But
if
she
is
engaged
,
or
can
not
love
my
nephew
,
I
do
n't
care
,
nor
would
my
lord
,
that
such
a
proposal
should
be
received
with
undue
slight
.
<EOS>
His
birth
,
and
the
title
and
estate
<EOS>
he
is
heir
to
,
are
advantages
that
require
a
lady
's
consideration
.
<EOS>
He
has
not
so
much
wit
as
Miss
,
but
enough
for
a
lord
,
whose
friends
are
born
before
him
,
as
the
phrase
is
;
is
very
good
-
humoured
,
no
tool
,
no
sot
,
no
debauchee
:
and
,
let
me
tell
you
,
this
is
not
to
be
met
with
every
day
in
a
young
man
of
quality
.
  
<EOS>
"
As
to
settlements
,
fortunes
,
&
c.
<EOS>
I
fancy
there
would
be
no
great
difficulties
.
<EOS>
The
business
is
,
if
Miss
Darnford
could
love
him
well
enough
for
a
husband
?
<EOS>
That
we
leave
you
to
sound
the
young
lady
;
and
if
she
thinks
she
can
,
we
will
directly
begin
a
treaty
with
Sir

I
am
,
my
dearest
Pamela
,
your
ever
affectionate
sister
,
B.
Davers
.
"
  
<EOS>
Now
,
my
dear
friend
,
as
my
lady
has
so
well
stated
the
case
,
I
beg
you
to
enable
me
to
return
an
answer
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
say
one
word
pro
or
con
.
<EOS>
till
I
know
your
mind
 
Only
,
that
I
think
he
is
good
-
humoured
and
might
be
easily
persuaded
to
any
thing
a
lady
should
think
reasonable
.
  
<EOS>
I
must
tell
you
another
piece
of
news
in
the
matrimonial
way
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Williams
has
been
here
to
congratulate
us
on
our
multiplied
blessings
;
and
he
acquainted
Mr.
B.
that
an
overture
has
been
made
him
by
his
new
patron
,
of
a
kinswoman
of
his
lordship
's
,
a
person
of
virtue
and
merit
,
and
a
fortune
of
three
thousand
pounds
,
to
make
him
amends
,
as
the
earl
tell
him
,
for
quitting
a
better
living
to
oblige
him
;
and
that
he
is
in
great
hope
of
obtaining
the
lady
's
consent
,
which
is
all
that
is
wanting
.
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
is
much
pleased
with
so
good
a
prospect
in
Mr.
Williams
's
favour
,
and
was
in
the
lady
's
company
formerly
at
a
ball
,
at
Gloucester
;
he
says
,
she
is
prudent
and
deserving
;
and
offers
to
make
a
journey
on
purpose
to
forward
it
,
if
he
can
be
of
service
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
I
suppose
you
know
that
all
is
adjusted
,
according
to
the
scheme
I
formerly
acquainted
you
with
,
between
Mr.
Adams
and
that
gentleman
;
and
both
are
settled
in
their
respective
livings
.
<EOS>
But
I
ought
to
have
told
you
,
that
Mr.
Williams
,
upon
mature
deliberation
,
declined
the
stipulated
eighty
pounds
per
annum
from
Mr.
Adams
,
as
he
thought
it
would
have
a
simoniacal
appearance
.
  
<EOS>
But
now
my
hand
's
in
<EOS>
,
let
me
tell
you
of
a
third
matrimonial
proposition
,
which
gives
me
more
puzzle
and
dislike
a
great
deal
.
<EOS>
And
that
is
,
Mr.
Adams
has
,
with
great
reluctance
,
and
after
abundance
of
bashful
apologies
,
asked
me
,
if
I
have
any
objection
to
his
making
his
addresses
to
<EOS>
Polly
Barlow
?
<EOS>
which
,
however
,
he
told
me
,
he
had
not
mentioned
to
her
,
nor
to
any
body
living
,
because
he
would
first
know
whether
I
should
take
it
amiss
,
as
her
service
was
so
immediately
about
my
person
.
  
<EOS>
This
unexpected
motion
much
perplexed
me
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Adams
is
a
worthy
man
.
<EOS>
He
has
now
a
very
good
living
;
yet
just
entered
upon
it
;
and
,
I
think
,
according
to
his
accustomed
prudence
in
other
respects
,
had
better
have
turned
himself
about
first
.
  
<EOS>
But
that
is
not
the
point
with
me
neither
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
great
regard
to
the
function
.
<EOS>
I
think
it
is
as
necessary
,
in
order
to
preserve
the
respect
due
to
the
clergy
,
that
their
wives
should
be
nearly
,
if
not
quite
as
unblemished
,
and
as
circumspect
,
as
themselves
;
and
this
for
the
gentleman
's
own
sake
,
as
well
as
in
the
eye
of
the
world
:
for
how
shall
he
pursue
his
studies
with
comfort
to
himself
,
if
made
uneasy
at
home
!
<EOS>
or
how
shall
he
expect
his
female
parishioners
will
regard
his
public
preaching
,
if
he
can
not
have
a
due
influence
over
the
private
conduct
of
his
wife
?
  
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
say
,
excepting
in
the
instance
of
Mr.
H.
but
Polly
is
a
good
sort
of
body
enough
so
far
as
I
know
;
but
that
is
such
a
blot
in
the
poor
girl
's
escutcheon
,
a
thing
not
accidental
,
nor
surprised
into
,
not
owing
to
inattention
,
but
to
cool
premeditation
,
that
,
I
think
,
I
could
wish
Mr.
Adams
a
wife
more
unexceptionable
.
  
<EOS>
@@@Tis
true
,
Mr.
Adams
knows
not
this
,
but
that
is
one
of
my
difficulties
.
<EOS>
If
I
acquaint
him
with
it
,
I
shall
hurt
the
poor
girl
irreparably
,
and
deprive
her
of
a
husband
,
to
whom
she
may
possibly
make
a
good
wife
 
<EOS>
For
she
is
not
very
meanly
descended
 
much
better
than
myself
,
as
the
world
would
say
were
a
judgment
to
be
made
from
my
father
's
low
estate
,
when
I
was
exalted
 
<EOS>
I
never
,
my
dear
,
shall
be
ashamed
of
these
retrospections
!
<EOS>
She
is
genteel
,
has
a
very
innocent
look
,
a
good
face
,
is
neat
in
her
person
,
and
not
addicted
to
any
excess
that
I
know
of
.
<EOS>
But
still
,
that
one
premeditated
fault
,
is
so
sad
<EOS>
a
one
,
though
she
might
make
a
good
wife
for
any
middling
man
of
business
,
yet
<EOS>
she
wants
,
methinks
,
that
discretion
,
that
purity
,
which
I
would
always
have
in
the
wife
of
a
good
clergyman
.
  
<EOS>
Then
,
she
has
not
applied
her
thoughts
to
that
sort
of
economy
,
which
the
wife
of
a
country
clergyman
ought
to
know
something
of
;
and
has
such
a
turn
to
dress
and
appearance
,
that
I
can
see
,
if
indulged
,
she
would
not
be
one
that
would
help
to
remove
the
scandal
which
some
severe
remarkers
are
apt
to
throw
upon
the
wives
of
parsons
,
as
they
call
them
.
  
<EOS>
The
maiden
,
I
believe
,
likes
Mr.
Adams
not
a
little
.
<EOS>
She
is
very
courteous
to
every
body
,
but
most
to
him
of
any
body
,
and
never
has
missed
being
present
at
our
Sunday
's
duties
;
and
five
or
six
times
,
Mrs.
Jervis
tells
me
,
she
has
found
her
desirous
to
have
Mr.
Adams
expound
this
text
,
and
that
difficulty
;
and
the
good
man
is
taken
with
her
piety
,
<EOS>
which
,
and
her
reformation
<EOS>
,
I
hope
,
is
sincere
;
but
she
is
very
sly
,
very
subtle
,
as
I
have
found
in
several
instances
,
as
foolish
as
she
was
in
the
affair
I
hint
at
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
So
,
"
sometimes
I
say
to
myself
,
"
the
girl
may
love
Mr.
Adams
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
"
but
then
I
answer
,
"
so
<EOS>
she
did
Mr.
H.
and
on
his
own
very
bad
terms
too
.
"
 
<EOS>
In
short
 
<EOS>
but
I
wo
n't
be
too
censorious
neither
.
  
<EOS>
So
I
'll
say
no
more
,
than
that
I
was
perplexed
;
and
yet
should
be
very
glad
to
have
Polly
well
married
;
for
,
since
that
time
,
I
have
always
had
some
diffidences
about
her
 
Because
,
you
know
,
Miss
 
<EOS>
her
fault
was
so
enormous
,
and
,
as
I
have
said
,
so
premeditated
.
<EOS>
I
wanted
you
to
advise
with
.
 
<EOS>
But
this
was
the
method
I
took
.
 
<EOS>
I
appointed
Mr.
Adams
to
drink
a
dish
of
tea
with
me
.
<EOS>
Polly
attended
,
as
usual
;
for
I
ca
n't
say
I
love
men
attendants
in
these
womanly
offices
.
<EOS>
A
tea
-
kettle
in
a
man
's
hand
,
that
would
,
if
there
was
no
better
employment
for
him
,
be
fitter
to
hold
a
plough
,
or
handle
a
flail
,
or
a
scythe
,
has
such
a
look
with
it
!
 
<EOS>
This
is
like
my
low
breeding
,
some
would
say
,
perhaps
,
 
<EOS>
but
I
can
not
call
things
polite
,
<EOS>
that
I
think
unseemly
;
and
,
moreover
.
<EOS>
Lady
Davers
keeps
me
in
countenance
in
this
my
notion
;
and
who
doubts
her
politeness
?
  
<EOS>
Well
,
but
Polly
attended
,
as
I
said
;
and
there
were
strange
simperings
,
and
bowing
,
and
curt'sying
,
between
them
;
the
honest
gentleman
seeming
not
to
know
how
to
let
his
mistress
wait
upon
him
;
while
she
behaved
with
as
much
respect
and
officiousness
,
as
if
she
could
not
do
too
much
for
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Very
well
,
"
thought
I
,
"
I
have
such
an
opinion
of
your
veracity
,
Mr.
Adams
,
that
I
dare
say
you
have
not
mentioned
the
matter
to
Polly
;
but
between
her
officiousness
,
and
your
mutual
simperings
and
complaisance
,
I
see
you
have
found
a
language
between
you
,
that
is
full
as
significant
as
plain
English
words
.
<EOS>
Polly
,
"
thought
I
,
"
sees
no
difficulty
in
this
text
;
nor
need
you
,
Mr.
Adams
,
have
much
trouble
to
make
her
understand
you
,
when
you
come
to
expound
upon
this
subject
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
was
forced
,
in
short
,
to
put
on
a
statelier
and
more
reserved
appearance
than
usual
,
to
make
them
avoid
acts
of
complaisance
for
one
another
,
that
might
not
be
proper
to
be
shewn
before
me
,
for
one
who
sat
as
my
companion
,
to
my
servant
.
  
<EOS>
When
she
withdrew
,
the
modest
gentleman
hemmed
,
and
looked
on
one
side
,
and
turned
to
the
right
and
left
,
as
if
his
seat
was
uneasy
to
him
,
and
,
I
saw
,
knew
not
how
to
speak
;
so
I
began
in
mere
compassion
to
him
,
and
said
 
"
Mr.
Adams
,
I
have
been
thinking
of
what
you
mentioned
to
me
,
as
to
Polly
Barlow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Hem
!
hem
!
<EOS>
"
said
he
;
and
pulled
out
his
handkerchief
,
and
wiped
his
mouth
 
"
Very
well
.
<EOS>
Madam
<EOS>
;
I
hope
no
offence
,
Madam
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
Sir
,
none
at
all
.
<EOS>
But
I
am
at
a
loss
how
to
distinguish
in
this
case
;
whether
it
may
not
be
from
a
motive
of
too
humble
gratitude
,
that
you
do
n't
think
yourself
above
matching
with
Polly
,
as
you
may
suppose
her
a
favourite
of
mine
;
or
whether
it
be
your
value
for
her
person
and
qualities
,
that
makes
her
more
agreeable
in
your
eyes
,
than
any
other
person
would
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Madam
 
Madam
,
"
said
the
bashful
gentleman
,
hesitatingly
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
 
<EOS>
I
must
needs
<EOS>
say
 
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
but
own
 
that
 
Mrs.
Mary
 
is
a
person
-
whom
I
think
very
agreeable
;
and
no
less
modest
and
virtuous
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
,
Sir
,
your
own
circumstances
.
<EOS>
To
be
sure
you
have
a
very
pretty
house
,
and
a
good
living
,
to
carry
a
wife
to
.
<EOS>
And
a
gentleman
of
your
prudence
and
discretion
wants
not
any
advice
;
but
you
have
reaped
no
benefits
by
your
living
.
<EOS>
It
has
been
an
expence
to
you
rather
,
which
you
will
not
presently
get
up
:
do
you
propose
an
early
marriage
,
Sir
?
<EOS>
Or
were
it
not
better
to
suspend
your
intentions
of
that
sort
for
a
year
or
two
more
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Madam
,
if
your
ladyship
choose
not
to
part
with
"
 
"
Nay
,
Mr.
Adams
,
"
interrupted
I
,
"
I
say
not
any
thing
for
my
own
sake
in
this
point
:
<EOS>
that
is
out
of
the
question
with
me
.
<EOS>
I
can
very
willingly
part
with
Polly
,
were
it
to
-
morrow
,
for
her
good
and
yours
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Madam
,
I
humbly
beg
pardon
;
 
but
 
<EOS>
but
 
delays
may
breed
dangers
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
I
very
well
,
"
thought
I
;
"
if
the
artful
girl
has
not
let
him
know
,
by
some
means
or
other
,
that
she
has
another
humble
servant
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
so
,
Miss
,
it
has
proved
 
<EOS>
For
,
dismissing
my
gentleman
,
with
assuring
him
,
that
I
had
no
objection
at
all
to
the
matter
,
or
to
parting
with
Polly
,
as
soon
as
it
suited
with
their
conveniency
 
<EOS>
I
sounded
her
,
and
asked
,
if
she
thought
Mr.
Adams
had
any
affection
for
her
?
 
<EOS>
She
said
he
was
a
very
good
gentleman
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
it
,
Polly
;
and
are
you
not
of
opinion
he
loves
you
a
little
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Dear
Ma'am
 
<EOS>
love
me
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
what
such
a
gentleman
as
Mr.
Adams
should
see
in
me
,
to
love
me
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
"
thought
I
,
"
does
the
doubt
lie
on
that
side
then
?
 
<EOS>
I
see
'
tis
not
of
thine
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Well
,
but
,
Polly
,
if
you
have
another
sweetheart
,
you
should
do
the
fair
thing
;
it
would
be
wrong
,
if
you
encourage
any
body
else
,
if
you
thought
of
Mr.
Adams
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Indeed
,
Ma'am
,
I
had
a
letter
sent
me
 
a
letter
that
I
received
 
from
 
from
a
young
man
in
Bedford
;
but
I
never
answered
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
"
thought
I
,
"
then
thou
wouldst
not
encourage
two
at
once
;
"
and
this
was
as
plain
a
declaration
as
I
wanted
,
that
she
had
thoughts
of
Mr.
Adams
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
how
came
Mr.
Adams
,
Polly
,
to
know
of
this
letter
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
How
came
he
to
know
of
it
,
Ma'am
!
"
 
<EOS>
repeated
she
 
half
surprised
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
I
do
n't
know
,
I
ca
n't
tell
how
it
was
 
<EOS>
but
I
dropped
it
near
his
desk
 
pulling
out
my
handkerchief
,
I
believe
,
Ma'am
,
and
he
brought
it
,
and
gave
it
me
again
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
thought
I
,
"
thou'rt
an
intriguing
slut
,
I
doubt
,
Polly
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Delays
may
breed
dangers
,
"
quoth
the
poor
gentleman
!
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
girl
,
girl
!
"
<EOS>
thought
I
,
but
did
not
say
so
,
"
thou
deservest
to
have
thy
plot
spoiled
,
that
thou
dost
 
<EOS>
But
if
thy
forwardness
should
expose
thee
afterwards
to
evils
which
thou
mayest
avoid
if
thy
schemes
take
place
,
I
should
very
much
blame
myself
.
<EOS>
And
I
see
he
loves
thee
 
<EOS>
So
let
the
matter
take
its
course
;
I
will
trouble
myself
no
more
about
it
.
<EOS>
I
only
wish
,
that
thou
wilt
make
Mr.
Adams
as
good
a
wife
as
he
deserves
.
"
  
<EOS>
And
so
I
dismissed
her
,
telling
her
,
that
whoever
thought
of
being
a
clergyman
's
wife
,
should
resolve
to
be
as
good
as
himself
;
to
set
an
example
to
all
her
sex
in
the
parish
,
and
shew
how
much
his
doctrines
had
weight
with
her
;
should
be
humble
,
circumspect
,
gentle
in
her
temper
and
manners
,
frugal
,
not
proud
,
nor
vying
in
dress
with
the
ladies
of
the
laity
;
<EOS>
should
resolve
to
sweeten
his
labour
,
and
to
be
obliging
in
her
deportment
to
poor
as
well
as
rich
,
that
her
husband
get
no
discredit
through
her
means
,
which
would
weaken
his
influence
upon
his
auditors
;
and
that
she
must
be
most
of
all
obliging
to
him
,
and
study
his
temper
,
that
his
mind
might
be
more
disengaged
,
in
order
to
pursue
his
studies
with
the
better
effect
.
  
<EOS>
And
so
much
for
your
humble
servant
;
<EOS>
and
for
Mr.
Williams
's
and
Mr.
Adams
's
matrimonial
prospect
;
 
and
do
n't
think
me
so
disrespectful
,
that
I
have
mentioned
my
Polly
's
affair
in
the
same
letter
with
yours
.
<EOS>
For
in
high
and
low
(
I
forget
the
Latin
phrase
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
had
a
lesson
a
long
,
long
while
,
from
my
dear
tutor
)
love
is
in
all
the
same
!
 
<EOS>
But
whether
you
'll
like
Mr.
H.
as
well
as
Polly
does
Mr.
Adams
,
that
's
the
question
.
<EOS>
But
,
leaving
that
to
your
own
decision
,
I
conclude
with
one
observation
;
that
,
although
I
thought
our
's
was
a
house
of
as
little
intriguing
as
any
body
's
,
since
the
dear
master
of
it
has
left
off
that
practice
,
yet
I
can
not
see
,
that
any
family
can
be
clear
of
some
of
it
long
together
,
where
there
are
men
and
women
worth
plotting
for
,
as
husbands
and
wives
.
  
<EOS>
My
best
wishes
and
respects
attend
all
your
worthy
neighbours
.
<EOS>
I
hope
ere
long
,
to
assure
them
,
severally
(
to
wit
,
Sir
Simon
,
my
lady
,
Mrs.
Jones
,
Mr.
Peters
,
and
his
lady
and
niece
,
whose
kind
congratulations
make
me
very
proud
,
and
very
thankful
)
how
much
I
am
obliged
to
them
;
and
particularly
,
my
dear
,
how
much
I
am
your
ever
affectionate
and
faithful
friend
and
servant
,
P.
B
,
    
From
Miss
Darnford
,
in
answer
to
the
preceding
.
  
<EOS>
MY
DEAR
MRS
.
<EOS>
B.
,
  
<EOS>
I
have
been
several
times
(
in
company
with
Mr.
Peters
)
to
see
Mrs.
Jewkes
.
<EOS>
The
poor
woman
is
very
bad
,
and
can
not
live
many
days
.
<EOS>
We
comfort
her
all
we
can
;
but
she
often
accuses
herself
of
her
past
behaviour
to
so
excellent
a
lady
;
and
with
blessings
upon
blessings
,
heaped
upon
you
,
and
her
master
,
and
your
charming
little
boy
,
is
continually
declaring
how
much
your
goodness
to
her
aggravates
her
former
faults
to
her
own
conscience
.
  
<EOS>
She
has
a
sister
-
in
-
law
and
her
niece
with
her
,
and
has
settled
all
her
affairs
,
and
thinks
she
is
not
long
for
this
world
.
 
<EOS>
Her
distemper
is
an
inward
decay
,
all
at
once
as
it
were
,
from
a
constitution
that
seemed
like
one
of
iron
;
and
she
is
a
mere
skeleton
:
<EOS>
you
would
not
know
her
,
I
dare
say
.
  
<EOS>
I
will
see
her
every
day
;
and
she
has
given
me
up
all
her
keys
,
and
accounts
,
to
give
to
Mr.
Longman
,
who
is
daily
expected
,
and
<EOS>
I
hope
will
be
here
soon
;
for
her
sister
-
in
-
law
,
she
says
herself
,
is
a
woman
of
this
world
,
as
she
has
been
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Peters
calling
upon
me
to
go
with
him
to
visit
her
,
I
will
break
off
here
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
is
much
as
she
was
;
but
your
faithful
steward
is
come
.
<EOS>
I
am
glad
of
it
 
<EOS>
and
so
is
she
 
<EOS>
Nevertheless
I
will
go
every
day
,
and
do
all
the
good
I
can
for
the
poor
woman
,
according
to
your
charitable
desires
.
  
<EOS>
I
thank
you
for
your
communication
of
Lady
Davers
's
letter
,
I
am
much
obliged
to
my
lord
,
and
her
ladyship
;
and
should
have
been
proud
of
an
alliance
with
that
noble
family
,
but
with
all
Mr.
H.
's
good
qualities
,
as
my
lady
paints
them
out
,
and
his
other
advantages
,
I
could
not
,
for
the
world
,
make
him
my
husband
.
<EOS>
I
'll
tell
you
one
of
my
objections
,
in
confidence
,
however
,
(
for
you
are
only
to
sound
me
,
you
know
:
)
and
I
would
not
have
it
mentioned
that
I
have
taken
any
thought
about
the
matter
,
because
a
stronger
reason
may
be
given
,
such
a
one
as
my
lord
and
lady
will
both
allow
;
which
I
will
communicate
to
you
by
and
bye
.
 
<EOS>
My
objection
arises
even
from
what
you
intimate
,
of
Mr.
H.
's
good
humour
,
and
his
persuadableness
,
if
I
may
so
call
it
.
<EOS>
Now
,
were
I
of
a
boisterous
temper
,
and
high
spirit
,
such
an
one
as
required
great
patience
in
a
husband
to
bear
with
me
,
then
Mr.
H.
's
good
humour
might
have
been
a
consideration
with
me
.
<EOS>
But
when
I
have
(
I
pride
myself
in
the
thought
)
<EOS>
a
temper
not
wholly
unlike
your
own
,
and
such
an
one
as
would
not
want
to
contend
for
superiority
with
a
husband
<EOS>
,
it
is
no
recommendation
to
me
,
that
Mr.
H.
is
a
good
-
humoured
gentleman
,
and
will
bear
with
faults
I
design
not
to
be
guilty
of
.
  
<EOS>
But
,
my
dear
Mrs.
B.
,
my
husband
must
be
a
man
of
sense
,
and
give
me
reason
to
think
he
has
a
superior
judgment
to
my
own
,
or
I
shall
be
unhappy
.
<EOS>
He
will
otherwise
do
wrong
-
headed
things
:
I
shall
be
forced
to
oppose
him
in
them
:
he
will
be
tenacious
and
obstinate
,
be
taught
to
talk
of
prerogative
,
and
to
call
himself
a
man
,
without
knowing
how
to
behave
as
one
,
and
I
to
despise
him
,
of
course
;
so
be
deemed
a
bad
wife
,
<EOS>
when
,
I
hope
,
I
have
qualities
that
would
make
me
a
tolerable
good
one
,
with
a
man
of
sense
for
my
husband
.
  
<EOS>
Now
you
must
not
think
I
would
dispense
with
real
good
-
humour
in
a
man
.
<EOS>
No
,
I
make
it
one
of
my
indispensables
in
a
husband
.
<EOS>
A
good
-
natured
man
will
put
the
best
constructions
on
what
happens
;
but
he
must
have
sense
to
distinguish
the
best
.
<EOS>
He
will
be
kind
to
little
,
unwilful
,
undesigned
failings
:
but
he
must
have
judgment
to
distinguish
what
are
or
are
not
so
.
<EOS>
But
Mr.
H.
's
good
-
humour
is
softness
,
as
I
may
call
it
;
and
my
husband
must
be
such
an
one
,
in
short
,
as
I
need
not
be
ashamed
to
be
seen
with
in
company
;
one
who
,
being
my
head
,
must
not
be
beneath
all
the
gentlemen
he
may
happen
to
fall
in
with
,
and
who
,
every
time
he
is
adjusting
his
mouth
for
speech
,
will
give
me
pain
at
my
heart
,
and
blushes
in
my
face
,
even
before
he
speaks
.
  
<EOS>
I
could
not
bear
,
therefore
,
that
every
one
we
encountered
should
be
prepared
,
whenever
he
offered
to
open
his
lips
,
by
their
contemptuous
smiles
,
to
expect
some
weak
and
silly
things
from
him
;
and
when
he
had
spoken
,
that
he
should
,
with
a
booby
grin
,
seem
pleased
that
he
had
not
disappointed
them
.
  
<EOS>
The
only
recommendatory
point
in
Mr.
H.
is
,
that
he
dresses
exceedingly
smart
,
and
is
no
contemptible
figure
of
a
man
.
<EOS>
But
,
dear
Madam
,
you
know
,
that
's
so
much
the
worse
,
when
the
man
's
talent
is
not
taciturnity
,
except
before
his
aunt
,
or
before
Mr.
B.
or
you
;
when
he
is
not
conscious
of
internal
defect
,
and
values
himself
upon
outward
appearance
.
  
<EOS>
As
to
his
attempts
upon
your
Polly
,
though
I
do
n't
like
him
the
better
for
it
,
yet
it
is
a
fault
so
wickedly
common
among
men
,
that
when
a
woman
resolves
never
to
marry
,
till
a
quite
virtuous
man
addresses
her
,
it
is
,
in
other
words
,
resolving
to
die
single
;
so
that
I
make
not
this
the
chief
objection
;
and
<EOS>
yet
,
I
would
abate
in
my
expectations
of
half
a
dozen
other
good
qualities
,
rather
than
that
one
of
virtue
in
a
husband
 
<EOS>
But
when
I
reflect
upon
the
figure
Mr.
H.
made
in
that
affair
,
I
can
not
bear
him
;
and
,
<EOS>
if
I
may
judge
of
other
coxcombs
by
him
,
what
wretches
are
these
smart
,
well
-
dressing
querpo
fellows
,
many
of
whom
you
and
I
have
seen
admiring
themselves
at
the
plays
and
operas
!
  
<EOS>
This
is
one
of
my
infallible
rules
,
and
I
know
it
is
yours
too
;
that
he
who
is
taken
up
with
the
admiration
of
his
own
person
,
will
never
admire
a
wife
's
.
<EOS>
His
delights
are
centred
in
himself
,
and
he
will
not
wish
to
get
out
of
that
exceeding
narrow
circle
;
and
,
in
my
opinion
,
should
keep
no
company
but
<EOS>
that
of
taylors
,
wig
-
puffers
,
and
milliners
.
  
<EOS>
But
I
will
run
on
no
further
upon
this
subject
;
but
will
tell
you
a
reason
,
which
you
may
give
to
Lady
Davers
,
why
her
kind
intentions
to
me
can
not
be
answered
;
and
which
she
'll
take
better
than
what
I
have
said
,
were
she
to
know
it
,
as
I
hope
you
wo
n't
let
her
:
and
this
is
,
my
papa
has
had
a
proposal
made
to
him
from
a
gentleman
you
have
seen
,
and
have
thought
polite
.
<EOS>
It
is
from
Sir
W.G.
of
this
county
,
who
is
one
of
your
great
admirers
,
and
Mr.
B.
's
too
;
and
that
,
you
must
suppose
,
makes
me
have
never
the
worse
opinion
of
him
,
or
of
his
understanding
;
although
it
requires
no
great
sagacity
or
penetration
to
see
how
much
you
adorn
our
sex
,
and
human
nature
too
.
  
<EOS>
Every
thing
was
adjusted
between
my
papa
and
mamma
,
and
Sir
William
,
on
condition
we
approved
of
each
other
,
before
I
came
down
;
which
I
knew
not
,
till
I
had
seen
him
here
four
times
;
and
then
my
papa
surprised
me
into
half
an
approbation
of
him
:
and
this
,
it
seems
,
was
one
of
the
reasons
why
I
was
so
hurried
down
from
you
.
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
say
,
but
I
like
the
man
as
well
as
most
I
have
seen
;
he
is
a
man
of
sense
and
sobriety
,
to
give
him
his
due
,
in
very
easy
circumstances
,
and
much
respected
by
all
who
know
him
;
which
is
no
bad
earnest
in
a
marriage
prospect
.
<EOS>
But
,
hitherto
,
he
seems
to
like
me
better
than
I
do
him
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
how
it
is
;
but
I
often
observe
,
that
when
any
thing
is
in
our
power
,
we
are
not
half
so
much
taken
with
it
,
as
we
should
be
,
perhaps
,
if
we
were
kept
in
suspense
!
<EOS>
Why
should
this
be
?
 
<EOS>
But
this
I
am
convinced
of
<EOS>
,
there
is
no
comparison
between
Sir
William
and
Mr.
Murray
.
  
<EOS>
Now
I
have
named
this
brother
-
in
-
law
of
mine
;
what
do
you
think
?
 
<EOS>
Why
,
that
good
couple
have
had
their
house
on
fire
three
times
already
.
<EOS>
Once
it
was
put
out
by
Mr.
Murray
's
mother
,
who
lives
near
them
;
and
twice
Sir
Simon
has
been
forced
to
carry
water
to
extinguish
it
;
for
,
truly
,
Mrs.
Murray
would
go
home
again
to
her
papa
;
she
would
not
live
with
such
a
surly
wretch
:
and
it
was
with
all
his
heart
;
a
fair
riddance
!
<EOS>
for
there
was
no
bearing
the
house
with
such
an
ill
-
natured
wife
:
 
<EOS>
her
sister
Polly
was
worth
a
thousand
of
her
!
 
<EOS>
I
am
heartily
sorry
for
their
unhappiness
.
<EOS>
But
could
she
think
every
body
must
bear
with
her
,
and
her
fretful
ways
?
 
<EOS>
They
'll
jangle
on
,
I
reckon
,
till
they
are
better
used
to
one
another
;
and
when
he
sees
she
ca
n't
help
it
,
why
he
'll
bear
with
her
,
as
husbands
generally
do
with
ill
-
tempered
wives
;
he
'll
try
to
make
himself
happy
abroad
,
and
leave
her
to
quarrel
with
her
maids
,
instead
of
him
;
for
she
must
have
somebody
to
vent
her
<EOS>
spleen
upon
 
poor
Nancy
!
 
<EOS>
I
am
glad
to
hear
of
Mr.
Williams
's
good
fortune
.
  
<EOS>
As
Mr.
Adams
knows
not
Polly
's
fault
,
and
it
was
prevented
in
time
,
they
may
be
happy
enough
.
<EOS>
She
is
a
sly
girl
.
<EOS>
I
always
thought
her
so
:
something
so
innocent
,
and
yet
so
artful
in
her
very
looks
:
she
is
an
odd
compound
.
<EOS>
But
these
worthy
and
piously
turned
young
gentlemen
,
who
have
but
just
quitted
the
college
,
are
mere
novices
,
as
to
the
world
:
indeed
they
are
above
it
,
while
in
it
;
they
therefore
give
themselves
little
trouble
to
study
it
,
and
so
,
depending
on
the
goodness
of
their
own
hearts
,
are
more
liable
to
be
imposed
upon
than
people
of
half
their
understanding
.
  
<EOS>
I
think
,
since
he
seems
to
love
her
,
you
do
right
not
to
hinder
the
girl
's
fortune
.
<EOS>
But
I
wish
she
may
take
your
advice
,
in
her
behaviour
to
him
,
at
least
:
for
as
to
her
carriage
to
her
neighbours
,
I
doubt
she
'll
be
one
of
the
heads
of
the
parish
,
presently
,
in
her
own
estimation
.
  
<EOS>
@@@Tis
pity
,
methinks
,
any
worthy
man
of
the
cloth
should
have
a
wife
,
who
,
by
her
bad
example
,
should
pull
down
,
as
fast
as
he
,
by
a
good
one
,
can
build
up
.
<EOS>
This
is
not
the
case
of
Mrs.
Peters
,
however
;
whose
example
I
wish
was
more
generally
followed
by
gentlewomen
,
who
are
made
so
by
marrying
good
clergymen
,
if
they
were
not
so
before
.
  
<EOS>
Do
n't
be
surprised
,
if
you
should
hear
that
poor
Jewkes
is
given
over
!
 
<EOS>
She
made
a
very
exemplary
 
Full
of
blessings
 
And
more
easy
and
resigned
,
than
I
apprehended
she
would
be
.
<EOS>
I
know
you
'll
shed
a
tear
for
the
poor
woman
:
 
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
help
it
myself
.
<EOS>
But
you
will
be
pleased
that
she
had
so
much
time
given
her
,
and
made
so
good
use
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Peters
has
been
every
thing
that
one
would
wish
one
of
his
function
to
be
,
in
his
attendance
and
advice
to
the
poor
woman
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Longman
will
take
proper
care
of
every
thing
.
<EOS>
So
,
I
will
only
add
,
that
I
am
,
with
the
sincerest
respect
,
in
hopes
to
see
you
soon
<EOS>
(
for
I
have
a
multitude
of
things
to
talk
to
you
about
)

dear
Mrs.
B.

your
ever
faithful
and
affectionate

DARNFORD

From
Mrs.

<EOS>
MY
DEAR
LADY
DAVERS
,
  
<EOS>
I
understand
from
Miss
Darnford
,
that
before
she
went
down
from
us
,
her
papa
had
encouraged
a
proposal
made
by
Sir
W.G.
whom
you
saw
,
when
your
ladyship
was
a
kind
visitor
in
Bedfordshire
.
<EOS>
We
all
agreed
,
if
you
remember
,
that
he
was
a
polite
and
sensible
gentleman
,
and
I
find
it
is
countenanced
on
all
hands
.
<EOS>
Poor
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
Madam
,
as
Miss
informs
me
,
has
paid
her
last
debt
.
<EOS>
I
hope
,
through
mercy
,
she
is
happy
!
 
<EOS>
Poor
,
poor
woman
!
<EOS>
But
why
say
I
so
!
 
<EOS>
Since
,
in
that
case
,
she
will
be
richer
than
an
earthly
monarch
!
  
<EOS>
Your
ladyship
was
once
mentioning
a
sister
of
Mrs.
Worden
's
whom
you
wished
to
recommend
to
some
worthy
family
.
<EOS>
Shall
I
beg
of
you
.
<EOS>
Madam
,
to
oblige
Mr.
B.
's
in
this
particular
?
<EOS>
I
am
sure
she
must
have
merit
if
your
ladyship
thinks
well
of
her
;
and
your
commands
in
this
,
as
well
as
in
every
other
particular
in
my
power
,
shall
have
their
due
weight
with
your
ladyship
's
obliged
sister
and
humble
servant
,
P.B.
  
<EOS>
Just
now
,
dear
Madam
,
Mr.
B.
tells
me
I
shall
have
<EOS>
Miss
Goodwill
brought
me
hither
to
-
morrow
.
    
<EOS>
From
Lady
Davers
to
Mrs.
B.
in
answer
to
the
preceding
.
  
<EOS>
MY
DEAR
PAMELA
,
  
<EOS>
I
am
glad
<EOS>
Miss
Darnford
is
likely
to
be
so
happy
in
a
husband
,
as
Sir
W.G.
will
certainly
make
her
.
<EOS>
I
was
afraid
that
my
proposal
would
not
do
with
her
,
had
she
not
had
so
good
a
tender
.
<EOS>
I
want
too
,
to
have
the
foolish
fellow
married
 
for
several
reasons
;
one
of
which
is
,
he
is
continually
teasing
us
to
permit
him
to
go
up
to
town
,
and
reside
there
for
some
months
,
in
order
that
he
may
see
the
world
,
as
he
calls
it
.
<EOS>
But
we
are
convinced
he
would
feel
it
,
as
well
as
see
it
,
if
we
give
way
to
his
request
:
for
in
understanding
,
dress
,
and
inconsiderate
vanity
,
he
is
so
exactly
cut
out
and
sized
for
a
town
fop
,
coxcomb
,
or
pretty
fellow
,
that
he
will
undoubtedly
fall
into
all
the
vices
of
those
people
;
and
,
perhaps
,
having
such
expectations
as
he
has
,
will
be
made
the
property
of
rakes
and
sharpers
.
<EOS>
He
complains
that
we
use
him
like
a
child
in
a
go
-
cart
,
or
a
baby
with
leading
-
strings
,
and
that
he
must
not
be
trusted
out
of
our
sight
.
'
<EOS>
Tis
a
sad
thing
,
that
these
bodies
will
grow
up
to
the
stature
of
men
,
when
the
minds
improve
not
at
all
with
them
,
but
are
still
those
of
boys
and
children
.
<EOS>
Yet
,
he
would
certainly
make
a
fond
husband
:
for
he
has
no
very
bad
qualities
.
<EOS>
But
is
such
a
Narcissus
!
 
<EOS>
But
this
between
ourselves
,
for
his
uncle
is
wrapt
up
in
the
fellow
 
<EOS>
And
why
?
<EOS>
Because
he
is
good
-
humoured
,
that
's
all
.
<EOS>
He
has
vexed
me
lately
,
which
makes
me
write
so
angrily
about
him
 
<EOS>
But
'
tis
not
worth
troubling
you
with
the
particulars
.
<EOS>
I
hope
Mrs.
Jewkes
is
happy
,
as
you
say
!
 
<EOS>
Poor
woman
!
<EOS>
she
seemed
to
promise
for
a
longer
life
!
<EOS>
But
what
shall
we
say
?
  
<EOS>
Your
compliment
to
me
,
about
my
Beck
's
sister
,
is
a
very
kind
one
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Oldham
is
a
sober
,
grave
widow
,
a
little
aforehand
,
in
the
world
,
but
not
much
;
has
lived
well
;
understands
house
-
hold
management
thoroughly
;
is
diligent
;
and
has
a
turn
to
serious
things
,
which
will
make
you
like
her
the
better
.
<EOS>
I
'll
order
Beck
and
her
to
wait
on
you
,
and
she
will
satisfy
you
in
every
thing
as
to
what
you
may
,
or
may
not
expect
of
her
.
  
<EOS>
You
ca
n't
think
how
kindly
I
take
this
motion
from
you
.
<EOS>
You
forget
nothing
that
can
oblige
your
friends
.
<EOS>
Little
did
I
think
you
would
remember
me
of
(
what
I
had
forgotten
in
a
manner
)
<EOS>
my
favourable
opinion
and
wishes
for
her
expressed
so
long
ago
.
 
<EOS>
But
you
are
what
you
are
 
a
dear
obliging
creature
.
  
<EOS>
Beck
is
all
joy
and
gratitude
upon
it
,
and
her
sister
had
rather
serve
you
than
the
princess
.
<EOS>
You
need
be
under
no
difficulties
about
terms
:
she
would
serve
you
for
nothing
,
if
you
would
accept
of
her
service
.
  
<EOS>
I
am
glad
,
because
it
pleases
you
so
much
,
that
Miss
Goodwin
will
be
soon
put
into
your
care
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
happy
for
the
child
,
and
I
hope
she
will
be
so
dutiful
as
to
give
you
no
pain
for
your
generous
goodness
to
her
.
<EOS>
Her
mamma
has
sent
me
a
present
of
some
choice
products
of
that
climate
,
with
acknowledgments
of
my
kindness
to
Miss.
<EOS>
I
will
send
part
of
it
to
you
by
your
new
servant
;
for
so
I
presume
to
call
her
already
.
  
<EOS>
What
a
naughty
sister
are
you
,
however
,
to
be
so
far
advanced
again
as
to
be
obliged
to
shorten
your
intended
excursions
,
and
yet
not
to
send
me
word
of
it
yourself
?
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
know
how
much
I
interest
myself
in
every
thing
that
makes
for
my
brother
's
happiness
and
your
's
?
<EOS>
more
especially
in
so
material
<EOS>
a
point
as
is
the
increase
of
a
family
that
it
is
my
boast
to
be
sprung
from
.
<EOS>
Yet
I
must
find
this
out
by
accident
,
and
by
other
hands
!
 
<EOS>
Is
not
this
very
slighting
!
 
<EOS>
But
never
do
so
again
,
and
I
'll
forgive
you
now
because
of
the
joy
it
gives
me
;
who
am
your
truly
affectionate
and
obliged
sister
,
B.
DAVERS
.
  
<EOS>
I
thank
you
for
your
book
upon
the
plays
you
saw
.
<EOS>
Inclosed
is
a
list
of
some
others
,
which
I
desire
you
to
read
,
and
to
oblige
me
with
your
remarks
upon
them
at
your
leisure
;
though
you
may
not
,
perhaps
,
have
seen
them
by
the
time
you
will
favour
me
with
your
observations
.

From
Mrs.
B.

<EOS>
MY
DEAR
LADY
DAVERS
,
  
<EOS>
I
have
a
valuable
present
made
me
by
the
same
lady
;
and
therefore
hope
you
will
not
take
it
amiss
,
that
,
with
abundance
of
thanks
,
I
return
your
's
by
Mrs.
Worden
,
whose
sister
I
much
approve
of
,
and
thank
your
ladyship
for
your
kind
recommendation
of
so
worthy
a
person
.
<EOS>
We
begin
with
so
much
good
liking
to
one
another
,
that
I
doubt
not
we
shall
be
very
happy
together
.
  
<EOS>
A
moving
letter
,
much
more
valuable
to
me
than
the
handsome
present
,
was
put
into
my
hands
,
at
the
same
time
with
that
;
of
which
the
following
is
a
copy

HAPPY
,
DESERVEDLY
HAPPY
,
DEAR
LADY
,
  
<EOS>
"
Permit
these
lines
to
kiss
your
hands
from
one
,
who
,
though
she
is
a
stranger
to
your
person
,
is
not
so
to
your
character
:
that
has
reached
us
here
,
in
this
remote
part
of
the
world
,
where
you
have
as
many
admirers
as
have
heard
of
you
.
<EOS>
But
I
more
particularly
am
bound
to
be
so
,
by
an
obligation
which
I
can
never
discharge
,
but
by
my
daily
prayers
for
you
,
and
the
blessings
I
continually
implore
upon
you
and
yours
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
write
my
whole
mind
to
you
,
though
I
can
not
,
from
the
most
deplorable
infelicity
,
receive
from
you
the
wished
-
for
favour
of
a
few
lines
in
return
,
written
with
the
same
unreservedness
:
<EOS>
so
unhappy
am
I
,
from
the
effects
of
an
inconsideration
and
weakness
on
one
hand
,
and
temptation
on
the
other
,
which
you
,
at
a
tender
age
,
most
nobly
,
for
your
own
honour
,
and
that
of
your
sex
,
have
escaped
:
whilst
I
 
but
let
my
tears
in
these
blots
speak
the
rest
 
as
my
heart
bleeds
,
and
has
constantly
bled
ever
since
,
at
the
grievous
remembrance
 
but
believe
,
however
,
<EOS>
dear
Madam
,
that
'
tis
shame
and
sorrow
,
and
not
pride
and
impenitence
,
that
make
me
both
to
speak
out
,
to
so
much
purity
of
life
and
manners
,
my
own
odious
weakness
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nevertheless
,
I
ought
,
and
I
will
accuse
myself
by
name

Imagine
then

illustrious
lady

truly
illustrious
for
virtues
,
infinitely
superior
to
all
the
advantages
of
birth

fortune

Imagine

I

you
see
before
you
the
once
guilty

therefore
,
I
doubt
,
<EOS>
always
guilty

but
ever
penitent

Sarah

the
unhappy

though
fond

tender
mother

the
poor
infant

your
generous

I

extended
itself

God
for
ever

it

<EOS>
prays
an
indulgent
mother

who
admires
at
an
awful
distance

that
virtue
in
you

which
she
could
not
practise
herself
.
  
<EOS>

And
will
you
,
dearest
lady
,
take
under
your
own
immediate
protection
,
the
poor
unguilty
infant

<EOS>
will
you
love
her
,
for
the
sake
of
her
suffering
mamma

whom
you
know
not

for
the
sake
of
the
gentleman

now
so
dear

so
worthy
of
you

I
hear

with
pleasure

he
is

And
will
you
,
by
the
best
example
in
the
world
,
give
me
a
moral
assurance
,
that
she
will
never
sink
into
the
fault

the
weakness

the
crime
(
I
ought
not

scruple

call
it

her
poor
inconsiderate

a
joy

it
to
me

in

midst
of
my
heavy
reflections
on
my
past
misconduct

that
my
beloved
Sally
can
boast
a
virtuous

innocent
mamma

who
has
withstood
the
snares

fatal

and
instructions

next
to
God

grace

will
be
the
strongest
fences
to
her
honour

Once
more
I
say
,

on
my
knees
I
write
it

God
for
ever
bless
you
here

augment
your
joys
hereafter

your
generous

motherless

I
hope
she

by
her
duty

obligingness

will
do
all

her
little
power

make
you
amends

never

wound
me
deeper

ungenerous

unkind

how
heavy
that

lie
upon

turns
my

freed

Mr.

your
acceptance

can
have
no

what
its
excelling

give
it
at
so
great

England

I
once
left

so
much
shame

regret

laudable

great
pleasure
the
opportunity
you

kindly
given

of
writing
to
a

obliged

you

the
right
you
make
over
to
me
,
of
your
maternal
interest

whom
I
set
my
heart

I
saw
her

love
and
tenderness
for
Miss

as
well
for
her
mamma
's
sake
,
as
your
late
worthy
spouse
's
,
had
,
from
her
kind
opinion
of
me
,
consented
to
grant
me
this
favour
:
and
I
was
,
by
Mr.
B.
's
leave
,
in
actual
possession
of
my
pretty
ward
about
a
week
before
your
kind
letter
came
to
my
hands

<EOS>
"
As
I
had
been
long
very
solicitous
for
this
favour
,
judge
how
welcome
your
kind
concurrence
was
:
and
the
rather
,
as
,
had
I
known
,
that
a
letter
from
you
was
on
the
way
to
me

I
should
have
feared
you
would
insist
upon
depriving
the
surviving
friends
of
her
dear
papa
,
of
the
pleasure
they
take
in
the
dear
child
.

Indeed
,
Madam
,
I
believe
we
should
one
and
all
have
joined
to
disobey
you
,
had
that
been
the
case
;
and
it
is
a
great
satisfaction
to
us
,
that
we
are
not
under
so
hard
a
necessity
,
as
to
dispute
with
a
tender
mamma
the
possession
of
her
own
child

Assure
yourself

worthiest
Madam

the
trust
you
repose

We
all
rejoice

in
the
account
you
give

your

<EOS>
It
was
impossible
that
God
Almighty
should
desert
a
lady
so
exemplarily
deserving
;
and
he
certainly
conducted
you
in
your
resolutions
to
abandon
every
thing
that
you
loved
in
England
,
after
the
loss
of
your
dear
spouse
,
because
it
seems
to
have
been
his
intention
that
you
should
reward
the
merit
of
Mr.
Wrightson
,
and
meet
with
your
own
reward
in
so
doing

<EOS>

Miss

very
fond
of
my
little
Billy

she
is
a
charming
child

is
easy

genteel

shape

and
very
pretty
;
she
dances
finely

has
a
sweet

is
improving
every

works
with

reads
admirably

takes

pleasure

she
is
not
very
forward
in
her
penmanship

you
will
see
by
what
follows

the
inditing
too

her
own

in

P.B.

Your

will
see
how
I
was
circumscribed

limited

otherwise
I
would
have
said
(
what
I
have
mentioned
more
than
once
)
<EOS>
,
how
I
admire
and
honour
her
for
her
penitence

and
for
that
noble
resolution

which
enabled
her
to
do
what
thousands
could
not
have
had
the
heart
to
do
,
abandon
her
country
,
her
relations
,
friends
,
baby
,
and
all
that
was
dear
to
her
,
as
well
as
the
seducer
,
whom
she
too
well
loved
,
and
hazard
the
sea
,
the
dangers
of
pirates
,
and
possibly
of
other
wicked
attempters
of
the
mischievous
sex
,
in
a
world
<EOS>
she
knew
nothing
of
,
among
strangers
;
and
all
to
avoid
repeating
a
sin
she
had
been
unhappily
drawn
into
;
and
for
which
she
still
abhors
herself
.
  
<EOS>
Must
not
such
a
lady
as
this
,
dear
Madam
,
have
as
much
merit
as
many
even
of
those
,
who
,
having
not
had
her
temptations
,
have
not
fallen
?
<EOS>
This
,
at
least
,
one
may
aver
,
that
next
to
not
committing
an
error
,
is
the
resolution
to
retrieve
it
all
that
one
may
,
to
repent
of
it
,
and
studiously
to
avoid
the
repetition
.
<EOS>
But
who
,
besides
this
excellent
Mrs.
Wrightson
,
having
so
fallen
,
and
being
still
so
ardently
solicited
and
pursued
,
(
and
flattered
,
perhaps
,
by
fond
hopes
,
that
her
spoiler
would
one
day
do
her
all
the
justice
he
could
 
for
who
can
do
complete
justice
to
a
woman
he
has
robbed
of
her
honour
?

could
resolve
as
she
resolved
,
and
act
as
she
acted
?
<EOS>
Miss
Goodwin
is
a
sweet
child
;
but
,
permit
me
to
say
,
has
a
little
of
her
papa
's
spirit
;
hasty
,
yet
generous
and
acknowledging
when
she
is
convinced
of
her
fault
;
a
little
haughtier
and
prouder
than
I
wish
her
to
be
;
but
in
every
thing
else
deserves
the
character
I
give
of
her
to
her
mamma
.
  
<EOS>
She
is
very
fond
of
fine
clothes
,
is
a
little
too
lively
to
the
servants
.
 
<EOS>
Told
me
once
,
when
I
took
notice
that
softness
and
mildness
of
speech
became
a
young
lady
,
that
they
were
but
servants
!
<EOS>
and
she
could
say
no
more
than
,
"
Pray
,
"
and
"
I
desire
,
"
and
<EOS>
"
I
wish
you
'd
be
so
kind
,
"
to
her
uncle
or
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
told
her
,
that
good
servants
deserved
any
civil
distinctions
;
and
that
so
long
as
they
were
ready
to
oblige
in
every
thing
,
by
a
kind
word
,
it
would
be
very
wrong
to
give
them
imperative
ones
,
which
could
serve
for
no
other
end
but
to
convince
observers
of
the
haughtiness
of
one
's
own
temper
;
and
looked
,
as
if
one
would
question
their
compliance
with
our
wills
,
unless
we
would
exact
it
with
an
high
hand
;
which
might
cast
a
slur
upon
the
command
we
gave
,
as
if
we
thought
it
was
hardly
so
reasonable
as
otherwise
to
obtain
their
observation
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Besides
,
my
dear
,
"
said
I
,
"
you
do
n't
consider
,
that
if
you
speak
as
haughtily
and
commandingly
to
them
on
common
,
as
on
extraordinary
occasions
,
you
weaken
your
own
authority
,
if
even
you
should
be
permitted
to
have
any
,
and
they
'll
regard
you
no
more
in
the
one
case
than
in
the
other
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
takes
great
notice
of
what
I
say
,
and
when
her
little
proud
heart
is
subdued
by
reasonings
she
can
not
answer
,
she
will
sit
as
if
she
were
studying
what
to
say
,
to
come
off
as
flying
as
she
can
,
and
as
the
case
requires
,
I
let
her
go
off
easily
,
or
push
the
little
dear
to
her
last
refuge
,
and
make
her
quit
her
post
,
and
yield
up
her
spirit
a
captive
to
Reason
and
Discretion
:
two
excellent
commanders
,
with
whom
,
I
tell
her
,
I
must
bring
her
to
be
intimately
acquainted
.
  
<EOS>
Yet
,
after
all
,
till
I
can
be
sure
that
I
can
inspire
her
with
the
love
of
virtue
,
for
its
own
sake
<EOS>
,
I
will
rather
try
to
conduct
her
spirit
to
proper
ends
,
than
endeavour
totally
to
subdue
it
;
being
sensible
that
our
passions
are
given
us
for
excellent
ends
,
and
that
they
may
,
by
a
proper
direction
,
be
made
subservient
to
the
noblest
purposes
.
  
<EOS>
I
tell
her
sometimes
,
there
may
be
a
decent
pride
in
humility
,
and
that
it
is
very
possible
for
a
young
lady
to
behave
with
so
much
true
dignity
,
as
shall
command
respect
by
the
turn
of
her
eye
,
sooner
than
by
asperity
of
speech
;
that
she
may
depend
upon
it
,
the
person
,
who
is
always
finding
faults
,
frequently
causes
them
;
and
that
it
is
no
glory
to
be
better
born
than
servants
,
if
she
is
not
better
behaved
too
.
  
<EOS>
Besides
,
I
tell
her
humility
is
a
grace
that
shines
in
a
high
condition
,
but
can
not
equally
in
a
low
one
;
because
that
is
already
too
much
humbled
,
perhaps
:
and
that
,
though
there
is
a
censure
lies
against
being
poor
and
proud
,
yet
I
would
rather
forgive
pride
in
a
poor
body
,
than
in
a
rich
:
for
in
the
rich
it
is
insult
and
arrogance
,
proceeding
from
their
high
condition
;
but
in
the
poor
it
may
be
a
defensative
against
dishonesty
,
and
may
shew
a
natural
bravery
of
mind
,
perhaps
,
if
properly
directed
,
and
manifested
on
right
occasions
,
that
the
frowns
of
fortune
can
not
depress
.
  
<EOS>
She
says
she
hears
every
day
things
from
me
,
which
her
governess
never
taught
her
.
  
<EOS>
That
may
very
well
be
,
I
tell
her
,
because
her
governess
has
many
young
ladies
to
take
care
of
:
<EOS>
I
but
one
;
and
that
I
want
to
make
her
wise
and
prudent
betimes
,
that
she
may
be
an
example
to
other
Misses
;
and
that
governesses
and
mammas
shall
say
to
their
Misses
,
"
When
will
you
be
like
Miss
Goodwin
?
<EOS>
Do
you
ever
hear
Miss
Goodwin
say
a
naughty
word
?
<EOS>
Would
Miss
Goodwin
,
think
you
,
have
done
so
or
so
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
threw
her
arms
about
my
neck
,
on
one
such
occasion
as
this
;
"
Oh
,
"
said
she
,
"
what
a
charming
mamma
have
I
got
!
<EOS>
I
will
be
in
every
thing
as
like
you
,
as
ever
I
can
!
 
<EOS>
and
then
you
will
love
me
,
and
so
will
my
uncle
,
and
so
will
every
body
else
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
whom
now
-
and
-
then
,
she
says
,
she
loves
as
well
as
if
he
was
her
own
papa
,
sees
with
pleasure
how
we
go
on
.
<EOS>
But
she
tells
me
,
I
must
not
have
any
daughter
but
her
,
and
is
very
jealous
on
the
occasion
about
which
your
ladyship
so
kindly
reproaches
me
.
  
<EOS>
There
is
a
pride
,
you
know
,
Madam
,
in
some
of
our
sex
,
that
serves
to
useful
purposes
,
is
a
good
defence
against
improper
matches
,
and
mean
actions
;
and
is
not
wholly
to
be
subdued
,
for
that
reason
;
for
,
though
it
is
not
virtue
,
yet
,
if
it
can
be
virtue
's
substitute
,
in
high
,
rash
,
and
inconsiderate
minds
,
it
;
may
turn
to
good
account
.
<EOS>
So
I
will
not
quite
discourage
my
dear
pupil
<EOS>
neither
,
till
I
see
what
discretion
,
and
riper
years
,
may
add
to
her
distinguishing
faculty
.
<EOS>
For
,
as
some
have
no
notion
of
pride
,
separate
from
imperiousness
and
arrogance
,
so
others
know
no
difference
between
humility
and
meanness
.
  
<EOS>
There
is
a
golden
mean
in
every
thing
;
and
if
it
please
God
to
spare
us
both
,
I
will
endeavour
to
point
her
passions
,
and
such
even
of
those
foibles
,
which
seem
too
deeply
rooted
to
be
soon
eradicated
,
to
useful
purposes
;
choosing
to
imitate
physicians
,
who
,
in
certain
chronical
illnesses
,
as
I
have
read
in
Lord
Bacon
,
rather
proceed
by
palliatives
,
than
by
harsh
extirpatives
,
which
,
through
the
resistance
given
to
them
by
the
constitution
,
may
create
such
ferments
in
it
,
as
may
destroy
that
health
<EOS>
it
was
their
intention
to
establish
.
  
<EOS>
But
whither
am
I
running
?
 
<EOS>
Your
ladyship
,
I
hope
,
will
excuse
this
parading
freedom
of
my
pen
:
for
though
these
notions
are
well
enough
with
regard
to
Miss
Goodwin
,
they
must
be
very
impertinent
to
a
lady
,
who
can
so
much
better
instruct
Miss
's
tutoress
than
that
vain
tutoress
can
her
pupil
.
<EOS>
And
,
therefore
,
with
my
humblest
respects
to
my
good
Lord
Davers
,
and
your
noble
neighbours
,
and
to
Mr.
H.
I
hasten
to
conclude
myself
your
ladyship
's
obliged
sister
,
and
obedient
servant
,
  
P.B.
  
<EOS>
Your
Billy
,
Madam
,
is
a
charming
dear
!
 
<EOS>
I
long
to
have
you
see
him
.
<EOS>
He
sends
you
a
kiss
upon
this
paper
.
<EOS>
You
'll
see
it
stained
,
just
here
.
<EOS>
The
charmer
has
cut
two
teeth
,
and
is
about
more
:
so
you
'll
excuse
the
dear
,
pretty
,
slabbering
boy
.
<EOS>
Miss
Goodwin
is
ready
to
eat
him
with
love
:
and
Mr.
B.
is
fonder
and
fonder
of
us
all
:
and
then
your
ladyship
,
and
my
good
Lord
Davers
love
us
too
.
<EOS>
O
,
Madam
,
what
a
blessed
creature
am
I
!
  
<EOS>
Miss
Goodwin
begs
<EOS>
I
'll
send
her
duty
to
her
noble
uncle
and
aunt
;
that
's
her
just
distinction
always
,
when
she
speaks
of
you
both
.
<EOS>
She
asked
me
,
pretty
dear
,
just
now
,
If
I
think
there
is
such
a
happy
girl
in
the
world
as
she
is
?
<EOS>
I
tell
her
,
God
always
blesses
good
Misses
,
and
makes
them
happier
and
happier
.
    
<EOS>
MY
DEAR
LADY
DAVERS
,
  
<EOS>
I
have
three
marriages
to
acquaint
you
with
,
in
one
letter
.
<EOS>
In
the
first
place
,
Sir
W.G.
has
sent
,
by
the
particular
desire
of
my
dear
friend
,
that
he
was
made
one
of
the
happiest
men
in
England
,
on
the
18th
past
;
and
so
I
have
no
longer
my
Miss
Darnford
to
boast
of
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
very
good
opinion
of
the
gentleman
;
but
if
he
be
<EOS>
but
half
so
good
a
husband
as
she
will
make
a
wife
<EOS>
,
they
will
be
exceedingly
happy
in
one
another
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Williams
's
marriage
to
a
kinswoman
of
his
noble
patron
(
as
you
have
heard
was
in
treaty
)
is
the
next
;
and
there
is
great
reason
to
believe
,
from
the
character
of
both
,
that
they
will
likewise
do
credit
to
the
state
.
  
<EOS>
The
third
is
Mr.
Adams
and
Polly
Barlow
;
and
I
wish
them
,
for
both
their
sakes
,
as
happy
as
either
of
the
former
.
<EOS>
They
are
set
out
to
his
living
,
highly
pleased
with
one
another
;
and
I
hope
will
have
reason
to
continue
so
to
be
.
  
<EOS>
As
to
the
first
,
I
did
not
indeed
think
the
affair
would
have
been
so
soon
concluded
;
and
Miss
kept
it
off
so
long
,
as
I
understood
,
that
her
papa
was
angry
with
her
:
and
,
indeed
,
as
the
gentleman
's
family
,
circumstances
,
and
character
,
were
such
,
that
there
could
lie
no
objection
against
him
<EOS>
,
I
think
it
would
have
been
wrong
to
have
delayed
it
.
  
<EOS>
I
should
have
written
to
your
ladyship
before
;
but
have
been
favoured
with
Mr.
B.
's
company
into
Kent
,
on
a
visit
to
my
good
mother
,
who
was
indisposed
.
<EOS>
We
tarried
there
a
week
,
and
left
both
my
dear
parents
,
to
my
thankful
satisfaction
,
in
as
good
health
as
ever
they
were
in
their
lives
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Judy
Swynford
,
or
Miss
Swynford
(
as
she
refuses
not
being
called
,
now
and
then
)
,
has
been
with
us
for
this
week
past
;
and
she
expects
her
brother
,
Sir
Jacob
,
to
fetch
her
away
in
about
a
week
hence
.
  
<EOS>
It
does
not
become
me
to
write
the
least
word
that
may
appear
disrespectful
of
any
person
related
to
your
ladyship
and
Mr.
B.
<EOS>
Otherwise
I
should
say
,
that
the
B####s
and
the
S####s
are
directly
the
opposites
of
one
another
.
<EOS>
But
yet
,
as
she
never
saw
your
ladyship
but
once
,
you
will
forgive
me
to
mention
a
word
or
two
about
her
,
because
she
is
a
character
that
is
in
a
manner
new
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
She
is
a
maiden
lady
,
as
you
know
,
and
though
she
will
not
part
with
the
green
leaf
from
her
hand
,
one
sees
by
the
grey
-
goose
down
on
her
brows
and
her
head
,
that
she
can
not
be
less
than
fifty
-
five
.
<EOS>
But
so
much
pains
does
she
take
,
by
powder
,
to
have
never
a
dark
hair
in
her
head
,
because
she
has
one
half
of
them
white
,
that
I
am
sorry
to
see
,
what
is
a
subject
for
reverence
,
should
be
deemed
,
by
the
good
lady
,
matter
of
concealment
.
  
<EOS>
She
is
often
seemingly
reproaching
herself
,
that
she
is
an
old
maid
,
and
an
old
woman
;
but
it
is
very
discernible
,
that
she
expects
a
compliment
,
that
she
is
not
so
,
every
time
she
is
so
free
with
herself
:
and
if
nobody
makes
her
one
,
she
will
say
something
of
that
sort
in
her
own
behalf
.
  
<EOS>
She
takes
particular
care
,
that
of
all
the
public
transactions
which
happen
to
be
talked
of
,
her
memory
will
never
carry
her
back
above
thirty
years
!
<EOS>
and
then
it
is
 
"
About
thirty
years
ago
;
when
I
was
a
girl
,
"
or
"
when
I
was
in
hanging
sleeves
;
"
and
so
she
makes
herself
,
for
twenty
years
of
her
life
,
a
very
useless
and
insignificant
person
.
  
<EOS>
If
her
teeth
,
which
,
for
her
age
,
are
very
good
,
though
not
over
white
(
and
which
,
by
her
care
of
them
,
she
seems
to
look
upon
as
the
last
remains
of
her
better
days
)
,
would
but
fail
,
it
might
help
her
to
a
conviction
,
that
would
set
her
ten
years
forwarder
at
least
.
<EOS>
But
,
poor
lady
,
she
is
so
young
,
in
spite
of
her
wrinkles
,
that
I
am
really
concerned
for
her
affectation
;
because
it
exposes
her
to
the
remarks
and
ridicule
of
the
gentlemen
,
and
gives
one
pain
for
her
.
  
<EOS>
Surely
,
these
ladies
do
n't
act
prudently
at
all
;
since
,
for
every
year
Mrs.
Judy
would
take
from
her
age
,
her
censurers
add
two
to
it
;
and
,
behind
her
back
,
make
her
going
on
towards
seventy
;
whereas
,
if
she
would
lay
claim
to
her
reverentials
,
as
I
may
say
,
and
not
try
to
conceal
her
age
,
she
would
have
many
compliments
for
looking
so
well
at
her
years
.
 
<EOS>
And
many
a
young
body
would
hope
to
be
the
better
for
her
advice
and
experience
,
who
now
are
afraid
of
affronting
her
,
if
they
suppose
she
has
lived
much
longer
in
the
world
than
themselves
.
  
<EOS>
Then
she
looks
back
to
the
years
she
owns
,
when
more
flippant
ladies
,
at
the
laughing
time
of
her
life
,
delight
to
be
frolic
:
she
tries
to
sing
too
,
although
,
if
ever
she
had
a
voice
,
she
has
outlived
it
;
and
her
songs
are
of
so
antique
a
date
,
that
they
would
betray
her
;
only
,
as
she
says
,
they
were
learnt
her
by
her
grandmother
,
who
was
a
fine
lady
at
the
Restoration
.
<EOS>
She
will
join
in
a
dance
;
and
though
her
limbs
move
not
so
pliantly
as
might
be
expected
of
a
lady
no
older
than
she
would
be
thought
,
and
whose
dancing
-
days
are
not
entirely
over
,
yet
that
was
owing
to
a
fall
from
her
horse
some
years
ago
,
which
,
she
doubts
,
she
shall
never
recover
,
though
she
finds
she
grows
better
and
better
,
every
year
.
  
<EOS>
Thus
she
loses
the
respect
,
the
reverence
,
she
might
receive
,
were
it
not
for
this
miserable
affectation
;
takes
pains
,
by
aping
youth
,
to
make
herself
unworthy
of
her
years
,
and
is
content
to
be
thought
less
discreet
than
she
might
otherwise
be
deemed
,
for
fear
she
should
be
imagined
older
if
she
appeared
wiser
.
  
<EOS>
What
a
sad
thing
is
this
,
Madam
!
 
<EOS>
What
a
mistaken
conduct
!
<EOS>
We
pray
to
live
to
old
age
;
and
it
is
promised
as
a
blessing
,
and
as
a
reward
for
the
performance
of
certain
duties
;
and
yet
,
when
we
come
to
it
,
we
had
rather
be
thought
as
foolish
as
youth
,
than
to
be
deemed
wise
,
and
in
possession
of
it
.
<EOS>
And
so
we
shew
how
little
we
deserve
what
we
have
been
so
long
coveting
;
and
yet
covet
on
:
for
what
?
<EOS>
Why
,
to
be
more
and
more
ashamed
,
and
more
and
more
unworthy
of
that
we
covet
!
  
<EOS>
How
fantastic
a
character
is
this!-Well
may
irreverent
,
unthinking
youth
despise
,
instead
of
revere
,
the
hoary
head
which
the
wearer
is
so
much
ashamed
of
.
<EOS>
The
lady
boasts
a
relationship
to
you
,
and
Mr.
B.
<EOS>
and
,
I
think
,
I
am
very
bold
.
<EOS>
But
my
reverence
for
years
,
and
the
disgust
I
have
to
see
anybody
behave
unworthy
of
them
,
makes
me
take
the
greater
liberty
:
<EOS>
which
,
however
,
I
shall
wish
I
had
not
taken
,
if
it
meets
not
with
that
allowance
,
which
I
have
always
had
from
your
ladyship
in
what
I
write
.
  
<EOS>
God
knows
whether
ever
I
may
enjoy
the
blessing
<EOS>
I
so
much
revere
in
others
.
<EOS>
For
now
my
heavy
time
approaches
.
<EOS>
But
I
was
so
apprehensive
before
,
and
so
troublesome
to
my
best
friends
,
with
my
vapourish
fears
,
that
now
(
with
a
perfect
resignation
to
the
Divine
Will
)
I
will
only
add
,
that
I
am
your
ladyship
's
most
obliged
sister
and
servant
,
<EOS>
P.B.
  
My
dear
Billy
,
and
Miss
Goodwin
,
improve
every
day
,
and
are
all
I
can
desire
or
expect
them
to
be
.
<EOS>
Could
Miss
's
poor
mamma
be
here
with
a
wish
,
and
back
again
,
how
much
would
she
be
delighted
with
one
of
our
afternoon
conferences
;
<EOS>
our
Sunday
employments
especially
!
 
<EOS>
And
let
me
add
,
that
I
am
very
happy
in
another
young
gentleman
of
the
dean
's
recommending
,
instead
of
Mr.
Adams

<EOS>
MY
DEAREST
LADY

<EOS>
I
am
once
more

blessed
be
God
for
all
his

<EOS>
enabled

my
upsitting

thank
you

my
noble
lord

for
all
your
kind

my

every

improves

<EOS>
Miss
is
all
I
wish
her
to
be

and
my
second
dear
boy
continues
to
be
as
lovely
and
as
fine
<EOS>
a
baby
as
your
ladyship
was
pleased
to
think
him
;
and
their
papa
,
the
best
of
husbands
!
  
<EOS>
I
am
glad
to
hear
Lady
Betty
is
likely
to
be
so
happy
.
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
says
,
her
noble
admirer
is
as
worthy
a
gentleman
as
any
in
the
peerage
;
and
I
beg
of
you
to
congratulate
the
dear
lady
,
and
her
noble
parents
,
in
my
name
,
if
I
should
be
at
a
distance
,
when
the
nuptials
are
celebrated
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
had
the
honour
of
a
visit
from
my
lady
,
the
Countess
Dowager
,
on
occasion
of
her
leaving
the
kingdom
for
a
year
or
two
,
for
which
space
<EOS>
she
designs
to
reside
in
Italy
,
principally
at
Naples
or
Florence
;
a
design
she
took
up
some
time
ago
,
but
which
<EOS>
it
seems
she
could
not
conveniently
put
into
execution
till
now
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
was
abroad
when
her
ladyship
came
,
and
I
expected
him
not
till
the
next
day
.
<EOS>
She
sent
her
gentleman
,
the
preceding
evening
,
to
let
me
know
that
business
had
brought
her
as
far
as
Wooburn
;
and
if
it
would
not
be
unacceptable
,
she
would
pay
her
respects
to
me
at
breakfast
,
the
next
morning
,
being
speedily
to
leave
England
.
<EOS>
I
returned
,
that
I
should
be
very
proud
of
that
honour
.
<EOS>
And
about
ten
her
ladyship
came
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
exceedingly
fond
of
my
two
boys
,
the
little
man
,
and
the
pretty
baby
,
as
she
called
them
;
and
I
had
very
different
emotions
from
the
expression
of
her
love
to
Billy
,
and
her
visit
to
me
,
from
what
I
had
once
before
.
<EOS>
She
was
sorry
<EOS>
,
she
said
,
Mr.
B.
was
abroad
;
though
her
business
was
principally
with
me
.
"
<EOS>
For
,
Mrs.
B.
,
"
said
she
,
"
I
come
to
tell
you
all
that
passed
between
Mr.
B.
and
myself
,
that
you
may
not
think
worse
of
either
of
us
,
than
we
deserve
;
and
I
could
not
leave
England
till
I
had
waited
on
you
for
this
purpose
;
and
yet
,
perhaps
,
from
the
distance
of
time
,
you
'll
think
it
needless
now
.
<EOS>
And
,
indeed
,
I
should
have
waited
on
you
before
,
to
have
cleared
up
my
character
with
you
,
<EOS>
had
I
thought
I
should
have
been
so
long
kept
on
this
side
of
the
water
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
said
,
I
was
very
sorry
<EOS>
I
had
ever
been
uneasy
,
when
I
had
two
persons
of
so
much
honour
 
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
"
said
she
,
interrupting
me
,
"
you
have
no
need
to
apologize
;
things
looked
bad
enough
,
as
they
were
presented
to
you
,
to
justify
greater
uneasiness
than
you
expressed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
asked
me
,
who
that
pretty
genteel
Miss
was
?
 
<EOS>
I
said
,
a
relation
of
Lord
Davers
,
who
was
entrusted
lately
to
my
care
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Then
,
Miss
,
"
said
her
ladyship
,
and
kissed
her
,
"
you
are
very
happy
.
"
  
<EOS>
Believing
<EOS>
the
Countess
was
desirous
of
being
alone
with
me
,
I
said
,
"
My
dear
Miss
Goodwin
,
wo
n't
you
go
to
your
little
nursery
,
my
love
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
for
so
she
calls
my
last
blessing
 
<EOS>
"
You
'd
be
sorry
the
baby
should
cry
for
you
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
For
she
was
so
taken
with
the
charming
lady
,
that
she
was
loth
to
leave
us
 
<EOS>
But
,
on
my
saying
this
,
withdrew
.
  
<EOS>
When
we
were
alone
,
the
Countess
began
her
story
,
with
a
sweet
confusion
,
which
added
to
her
loveliness
.
<EOS>
She
said
she
would
be
brief
,
because
she
should
exact
all
my
attention
,
and
not
suffer
me
to
interrupt
her
till
she
had
done
.
<EOS>
She
began
with
acknowledging
,
that
she
thought
,
when
she
first
saw
Mr.
B.
at
the
masquerade
,
that
he
was
the
finest
gentleman
she
had
ever
seen
;
that
the
allowed
freedoms
of
the
place
had
made
her
take
liberties
in
following
him
,
and
engaging
him
wherever
he
went
.
<EOS>
She
blamed
him
very
freely
for
passing
for
a
single
man
;
for
that
,
she
said
,
since
she
had
so
splendid
a
fortune
of
her
own
,
was
all
she
was
solicitous
about
;
having
never
,
as
she
confessed
,
seen
a
man
she
could
like
so
well
;
her
former
marriage
having
been
in
some
sort
forced
upon
her
,
at
an
age
when
she
knew
not
how
to
distinguish
;
and
that
she
was
very
loth
to
believe
him
married
,
even
when
she
had
no
reason
to
doubt
it
.
"
<EOS>
Yet
this
I
must
say
,
"
said
she
,
"
I
never
heard
a
man
,
when
he
owned
he
was
married
,
express
himself
with
more
affectionate
regard
and
fondness
than
he
did
of
you
;
which
made
me
long
to
see
you
;
for
I
had
a
great
opinion
of
those
personal
advantages
which
every
one
flattered
me
with
;
and
was
very
unwilling
to
yield
the
palm
of
beauty
to
you
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
you
will
censure
me
,
Mrs.
B.
,
for
permitting
his
visits
after
I
knew
he
was
married
.
<EOS>
To
be
sure
,
that
was
a
thoughtless
,
and
a
faulty
part
of
my
conduct
.
<EOS>
But
the
world
's
saucy
censures
,
and
my
friends
'
indiscreet
interposals
,
incensed
me
;
and
,
knowing
the
uprightness
of
my
own
heart
,
I
was
resolved
to
disgrace
both
,
when
I
found
they
could
not
think
worse
of
me
than
they
did
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
naturally
of
a
high
spirit
,
impatient
of
contradiction
,
always
gave
myself
freedoms
,
for
which
,
satisfied
with
my
own
innocence
,
I
thought
myself
above
being
accountable
to
any
body
 
<EOS>
And
then
Mr.
B.
has
such
noble
sentiments
,
a
courage
and
fearlessness
,
which
I
saw
on
more
occasions
than
one
,
that
all
ladies
who
know
the
weakness
of
their
own
sex
,
and
how
much
they
want
the
protection
of
the
brave
,
are
taken
with
.
<EOS>
Then
his
personal
address
was
so
peculiarly
distinguishing
,
that
having
an
opinion
of
his
honour
,
I
was
embarrassed
greatly
how
to
deny
myself
his
conversation
;
although
,
you
'll
pardon
me
,
Mrs.
B.
,
I
began
to
be
afraid
that
my
reputation
might
suffer
in
the
world
's
opinion
for
the
indulgence
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
,
when
I
had
resolved
,
as
I
did
several
times
,
to
see
him
no
more
,
some
unforeseen
accident
threw
him
in
my
way
again
,
at
one
entertainment
or
other
;
for
I
love
balls
and
concerts
,
and
public
diversions
,
perhaps
,
better
than
I
ought
;
and
then
I
had
all
my
resolves
to
begin
again
.
<EOS>
Yet
this
I
can
truly
say
,
whatever
his
views
were
,
I
never
heard
from
him
the
least
indecent
expression
,
nor
saw
in
his
behaviour
to
me
much
to
apprehend
;
saving
,
I
began
to
fear
,
that
by
his
insinuating
address
,
and
noble
manner
,
I
should
be
too
much
in
his
power
,
and
too
little
in
my
own
,
if
I
went
on
so
little
doubting
,
and
so
little
alarmed
,
if
ever
he
should
avow
dishonourable
designs
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
had
often
lamented
,
that
our
sex
were
prohibited
,
by
the
designs
of
the
other
upon
their
honour
,
and
by
the
world
's
censures
,
from
conversing
with
the
same
ease
and
freedom
with
gentlemen
,
as
with
one
another
.
<EOS>
And
when
once
I
asked
myself
,
to
what
this
conversation
might
tend
at
last
?
<EOS>
and
where
the
pleasure
each
seemed
to
take
in
the
other
's
,
might
possibly
end
?
<EOS>
I
resolved
to
break
it
off
;
and
told
him
my
resolution
next
time
I
saw
him
.
<EOS>
But
he
stopped
my
mouth
with
a
romantic
notion
,
as
I
since
think
it
,
(
though
a
sorry
plea
will
have
weight
in
favour
of
a
proposal
,
to
which
one
has
no
aversion
)
of
Platonic
love
;
and
we
had
an
intercourse
by
letters
,
to
the
number
of
six
or
eight
,
I
believe
,
on
that
and
other
subjects
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yet
all
this
time
,
I
was
the
less
apprehensive
,
because
he
always
spoke
so
tenderly
,
and
even
with
delight
,
whenever
he
mentioned
his
lady
;
and
I
could
not
find
,
that
you
were
at
all
alarmed
at
our
acquaintance
:
for
I
never
scrupled
to
send
my
letters
,
by
my
own
livery
,
to
your
house
,
sealed
with
my
own
seal
.
<EOS>
At
last
,
indeed
,
he
began
to
tell
me
,
that
from
the
sweetest
and
evenest
temper
in
the
world
,
you
seemed
to
be
leaning
towards
melancholy
,
were
always
in
tears
,
or
shewed
you
had
been
weeping
,
when
he
came
home
;
and
that
you
did
not
make
his
return
to
you
so
agreeable
as
he
used
to
find
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
asked
if
it
were
not
owing
to
some
alteration
in
his
own
temper
?
<EOS>
If
you
might
not
be
uneasy
at
our
acquaintance
,
and
at
his
frequent
absence
from
you
,
and
the
like
?
<EOS>
He
answered
,
No
;
that
you
were
above
disguises
,
were
of
a
noble
and
frank
nature
,
and
would
have
hinted
it
to
him
,
if
you
had
.
<EOS>
This
,
however
,
when
I
began
to
think
seriously
of
the
matter
,
gave
me
but
little
satisfaction
;
and
I
was
more
and
more
convinced
,
that
my
honour
required
it
of
me
,
to
break
off
this
intimacy
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
although
I
permitted
Mr.
B.
to
go
with
me
to
Tunbridge
,
when
I
went
to
take
a
house
there
,
yet
I
was
uneasy
,
as
he
saw
.
<EOS>
And
,
indeed
,
so
was
he
,
though
he
tarried
a
day
or
two
longer
than
he
designed
,
on
account
of
a
little
excursion
my
sister
and
her
lord
,
and
he
and
I
,
made
into
Sussex
,
to
see
an
estate
I
thought
of
purchasing
;
for
he
was
so
good
as
to
look
into
my
affairs
,
and
has
put
them
upon
an
admirable
establishment
.
  
<EOS>
"
His
uneasiness
,
I
found
,
was
upon
your
account
,
and
he
sent
you
a
letter
to
excuse
himself
for
not
waiting
on
you
on
Saturday
,
and
to
say
,
he
would
dine
with
you
on
Monday
.
<EOS>
And
I
remember
when
I
said
,
"
Mr.
B.
,
you
seem
to
be
chagrined
at
something
;
you
are
more
thoughtful
than
usual
:
"
his
answer
was
,
"
Madam
,
you
are
right
,
Mrs.
B.
and
I
have
had
a
little
misunderstanding
.
<EOS>
She
is
so
solemn
,
and
so
melancholy
of
late
<EOS>
,
I
fear
it
will
be
no
difficult
matter
to
put
her
out
of
her
right
mind
:
<EOS>
and
I
love
her
so
well
,
that
then
I
should
hardly
keep
my
own
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
"
Is
there
no
reason
,
think
you
,
"
said
I
,
"
to
imagine
that
your
acquaintance
with
me
gives
her
uneasiness
?
<EOS>
You
know
,
Mr.
B.
,
how
that
villain
T.
"
(
a
man
,
"
said
she
,
"
whose
insolent
address
I
rejected
with
the
contempt
it
deserved
)
"
has
slandered
us
.
<EOS>
How
know
you
,
but
he
has
found
a
way
to
your
wife
's
ear
,
as
he
has
done
to
my
uncle
's
,
and
to
all
my
friends
"
?
<EOS>
And
if
so
,
it
is
best
for
us
both
to
discontinue
a
friendship
,
that
may
be
attended
with
disagreeable
consequences
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
He
said
,
he
should
find
it
out
on
his
return
.
"
<EOS>
And
will
you
,
"
said
I
,
"
ingenuously
acquaint
me
with
the
issue
of
your
inquiries
?
<EOS>
for
,
"
added
I
,
"
I
never
beheld
a
countenance
,
in
so
young
a
lady
,
<EOS>
that
seemed
to
mean
more
than
Mrs.
B.
's
,
when
I
saw
her
in
town
;
and
notwithstanding
her
prudence
I
could
see
a
reserve
and
thoughtfulness
in
it
,
that
,
if
it
was
not
natural
to
it
,
must
indicate
too
much
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
wrote
to
me
,
in
a
very
moving
letter
,
the
issue
of
your
conference
,
and
referred
to
some
papers
of
your
's
,
that
he
would
shew
me
,
as
soon
as
he
could
procure
them
,
they
being
of
your
own
hands
;
and
let
me
know
that
T.
was
the
accuser
,
as
I
had
suspected
.
  
<EOS>
"
In
brief
,
Madam
,
when
you
went
down
into
Kent
,
he
read
to
me
some
part
of
your
account
to
Lady
Davers
,
of
your
informant
and
information
;
your
apprehensions
;
your
prudence
;
your
affection
for
him
;
the
reason
of
your
melancholy
;
and
,
to
all
appearance
,
reason
enough
you
had
,
especially
from
the
letter
of
Thomasine
Fuller
,
which
was
one
of
T.
's
vile
forgeries
:
for
though
we
had
often
,
for
argument
's
sake
,
talked
of
polygamy
<EOS>
(
he
arguing
for
it
,
I
against
it
)
,
yet
had
not
Mr.
B.
dared
,
nor
was
he
inclined
,
I
verily
believe
,
to
propose
any
such
thing
to
me
:
no
,
Madam
,
I
was
not
so
much
abandoned
to
a
sense
of
honour
,
as
to
give
reason
for
any
one
,
but
my
impertinent
and
foolish
uncle
,
to
impute
such
a
folly
to
me
;
and
he
had
so
behaved
to
me
,
that
I
cared
not
what
he
thought
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
,
what
he
read
to
me
,
here
and
there
,
as
he
pleased
,
gave
me
reason
to
admire
you
for
your
generous
opinion
of
one
you
had
so
much
seeming
cause
<EOS>
to
be
afraid
of
<EOS>
:
he
told
me
his
apprehensions
,
from
your
uncommon
manner
,
that
your
mind
was
in
some
degree
affected
,
and
your
strange
proposal
of
parting
with
a
husband
<EOS>
every
one
knows
you
so
dearly
love
:
and
we
agreed
to
forbear
seeing
each
other
,
and
all
manner
of
correspondence
,
except
by
letter
,
for
one
month
,
till
some
of
my
affairs
were
settled
,
which
had
been
in
great
disorder
,
and
were
in
his
kind
management
then
;
and
I
had
not
one
relation
,
whom
I
cared
to
trouble
with
them
,
because
of
their
treatment
of
me
on
Mr.
B.
's
account
.
<EOS>
And
this
,
I
told
him
,
should
not
be
neither
,
but
through
your
hands
,
and
with
your
consent
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
thus
,
Madam
,
"
said
her
ladyship
,
"
have
I
told
you
the
naked
truth
of
the
whole
affair
.
<EOS>
I
have
seen
Mr.
B.
very
seldom
since
:
and
when
I
have
,
it
has
been
either
at
a
horse
-
race
,
in
the
open
field
,
or
at
some
public
diversion
,
by
accident
,
where
only
distant
civilities
have
passed
between
us
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
respect
him
greatly
;
you
must
allow
me
to
say
that
.
<EOS>
Except
in
the
article
of
permitting
me
to
believe
,
for
some
time
,
that
he
was
a
single
gentleman
,
a
fault
he
can
not
be
excused
for
,
and
which
made
me
heartily
quarrel
with
him
,
when
I
first
knew
it
,
he
has
behaved
to
me
with
so
much
generosity
and
honour
,
that
I
could
have
wished
I
had
been
of
his
sex
,
since
he
had
a
lady
so
much
more
deserving
than
myself
;
and
then
,
had
he
had
the
same
esteem
for
me
<EOS>
,
there
never
would
have
been
a
more
perfect
friendship
.
<EOS>
I
am
now
going
,
"
continued
she
,
"
to
embark
for
France
,
and
shall
pass
a
year
or
two
in
Italy
;
and
then
I
shall
,
I
hope
,
return
as
solid
,
as
grave
,
as
circumspect
,
though
not
so
wise
,
as
Mrs.
B.
"
  
Thus
the
Countess
concluded
her
narrative
:
<EOS>
I
said
,
I
was
greatly
obliged
to
her
for
the
honour
of
this
visit
,
and
the
kind
and
considerate
occasion
of
it
:
but
that
Mr.
B.
had
made
me
entirely
happy
in
every
particular
,
and
had
done
her
ladyship
the
justice
she
so
well
deserved
,
having
taken
upon
himself
the
blame
of
passing
as
a
single
man
at
his
first
acquaintance
with
her
.
  
<EOS>
I
added
,
that
I
could
hope
her
ladyship
might
be
prevented
,
by
some
happy
man
,
from
leaving
a
kingdom
,
to
which
she
was
so
great
<EOS>
an
ornament
,
as
well
by
her
birth
,
her
quality
and
fortune
,
as
by
her
perfections
of
person
and
mind
.
  
<EOS>
She
said
,
she
had
not
been
the
happiest
of
her
sex
in
her
former
marriage
:
although
nobody
,
her
youth
considered
,
thought
her
a
bad
wife
;
and
her
lord
's
goodness
to
her
,
at
his
death
,
had
demonstrated
his
own
favourable
opinion
of
her
by
deeds
,
as
he
had
done
by
words
upon
all
occasions
:
but
that
she
was
yet
young
;
a
little
too
gay
and
unsettled
:
and
had
her
head
turned
towards
France
and
Italy
,
having
passed
some
time
in
those
countries
,
which
she
thought
of
with
pleasure
,
though
then
only
twelve
or
thirteen
:
that
for
this
reason
,
and
having
been
on
a
late
occasion
still
more
unsettled
(
looking
down
with
blushes
,
which
often
overspread
her
face
,
as
she
talked
)
<EOS>
,
she
had
refused
some
offers
,
not
despicable
:
that
indeed
Lord
C.
threatened
to
follow
her
to
Italy
,
in
hopes
of
meeting
better
success
there
,
than
he
had
met
with
here
:
but
if
he
did
,
though
she
would
make
no
resolutions
,
she
might
be
too
much
offended
with
him
,
to
give
him
reason
to
boast
of
his
journey
;
and
this
the
rather
,
as
she
believed
he
had
once
entertained
no
very
honourable
notions
of
her
friendship
for
Mr.
B.
  
She
wished
to
see
Mr.
B.
and
to
take
leave
of
him
,
but
not
out
of
my
company
,
she
was
pleased
to
say
.
 
<EOS>
"
Your
ladyship
's
consideration
for
me
,
"
replied
I
,
"
lays
me
under
high
obligation
;
but
indeed
,
Madam
,
there
is
no
occasion
for
it
,
from
any
diffidences
I
have
in
your
's
or
Mr.
B.
's
honour
.
<EOS>
And
if
you
will
give
me
the
pleasure
of
knowing
when
it
will
be
most
acceptable
,
I
will
beg
of
Mr.
B.
to
oblige
me
with
his
company
to
return
this
favour
,
the
first
visit
I
make
abroad
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
very
kind
,
Mrs.
B.
,
"
said
she
:
"
<EOS>
but
I
think
to
go
to
Tunbridge
for
a
fortnight
,
when
I
have
disposed
of
every
thing
for
my
embarkation
,
and
so
set
out
from
thence
.
<EOS>
And
if
you
should
then
be
both
in
Kent
,
I
should
be
glad
to
take
you
at
your
word
.
"
  
<EOS>
To
be
sure
,
I
said
,
Mr.
B.
at
least
,
would
attend
her
ladyship
there
,
if
any
thing
should
happen
to
deprive
me
of
that
honour
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
very
obliging
,
"
said
she
,
"
I
take
great
concern
to
myself
,
for
having
caused
you
a
moment
's
uneasiness
formerly
:
but
I
must
now
try
to
be
circumspect
,
in
order
to
retrieve
my
character
,
which
has
been
so
basely
traduced
by
that
presumptuous
fellow
Turner
,
who
hoped
,
I
suppose
,
by
that
means
,
to
bring
me
down
to
his
level
.
"
  
<EOS>
Her
ladyship
would
not
be
prevailed
upon
to
stay
dinner
;
and
,
saying
she
would
be
at
Wooburn
all
the
next
day
,
took
a
very
tender
leave
of
me
,
wishing
me
all
manner
of
happiness
,
as
I
did
her
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
came
home
in
the
evening
,
and
next
morning
rode
to
Wooburn
,
to
pay
his
respects
to
the
Countess
,
and
came
back
in
the
evening
.
  
<EOS>
Thus
happily
,
and
to
the
satisfaction
of
all
three
,
as
I
hope
,
ended
this
perplexing
affair
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
asks
me
how
I
relish
Mr.
Locke
's
Treatise
on
Education
?
<EOS>
which
he
put
into
my
hands
some
time
since
,
as
I
told
your
ladyship
.
<EOS>
I
answered
,
Very
well
;
and
I
thought
it
an
excellent
piece
in
the
main
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
tell
you
,
"
said
he
,
"
what
you
shall
do
.
<EOS>
You
have
not
shewed
me
any
thing
you
have
written
for
a
good
while
.
<EOS>
I
could
wish
you
to
fill
up
your
leisure
-
time
with
your
observations
on
that
treatise
,
that
I
may
know
what
you
can
object
to
it
;
for
you
say
in
the
main
,
which
shews
,
that
you
do
not
entirely
approve
of
every
part
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
But
will
not
that
be
presumptuous
,
Sir
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
admire
Mr.
Locke
,
"
replied
he
;
"
and
I
admire
my
Pamela
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
doubt
of
his
excellencies
,
but
I
want
to
know
the
sentiments
of
a
young
mother
,
as
well
as
of
a
learned
gentleman
,
upon
the
subject
of
education
;
because
I
have
heard
several
ladies
censure
some
part
of
his
regimen
,
when
I
am
convinced
,
that
the
fault
lies
in
their
own
over
-
great
fondness
for
their
children
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
As
to
myself
,
Sir
,
who
,
in
the
early
part
of
my
life
,
have
not
been
brought
up
too
tenderly
,
you
will
hardly
meet
with
any
objection
to
the
part
which
I
imagine
you
have
heard
most
objected
to
by
ladies
who
have
been
more
indulgently
treated
in
their
first
stage
.
<EOS>
But
there
are
a
few
other
things
that
want
clearing
up
to
my
understanding
;
but
,
which
,
however
,
may
be
the
fault
of
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
,
my
dear
,
"
said
he
,
"
suppose
me
at
a
distance
from
you
,
can
not
you
give
me
your
remarks
in
the
same
manner
,
as
if
you
were
writing
to
Lady
Davers
,
or
to
Miss
Darnford
,
that
was
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Sir
,
depending
on
your
kind
favour
to
me
,
I
believe
I
could
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
then
;
and
the
less
restraint
you
write
with
,
the
more
I
shall
be
pleased
with
it
.
<EOS>
But
I
confine
you
not
to
time
or
place
.
<EOS>
We
will
make
our
excursions
as
I
once
proposed
;
and
do
you
write
to
me
now
-
and
-
then
upon
the
subject
;
for
the
places
and
remarkables
you
will
see
,
will
be
new
only
to
yourself
;
nor
will
either
of
those
ladies
expect
from
you
an
itinerary
,
or
a
particular
description
of
countries
,
which
are
better
described
by
authors
who
have
made
it
their
business
to
treat
upon
those
subjects
.
<EOS>
By
this
means
,
you
will
be
usefully
employed
in
your
own
way
,
which
may
turn
to
good
account
to
us
both
,
and
to
the
dear
children
,
which
it
may
please
God
to
bestow
upon
us
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
expect
,
Sir
,
any
thing
regular
,
or
digested
from
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
Let
your
fancy
and
your
judgment
be
both
employed
,
and
I
require
no
method
;
for
I
know
,
in
your
easy
,
natural
way
,
that
would
be
a
confinement
,
which
would
cramp
your
genius
,
and
give
what
you
write
a
stiff
,
formal
air
,
that
I
might
expect
in
a
pedagogue
,
but
not
in
my
Pamela
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Well
,
but
,
Sir
,
although
I
may
write
nothing
to
the
purpose
,
yet
if
Lady
Davers
desires
it
,
you
will
allow
me
to
transmit
what
I
shall
write
to
her
,
when
you
have
perused
it
yourself
?
<EOS>
For
your
good
sister
is
so
indulgent
to
my
scribble
,
she
will
expect
to
be
always
hearing
from
me
;
and
this
way
I
shall
oblige
her
ladyship
while
I
obey
her
brother
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
With
all
my
heart
,
"
he
was
pleased
to
say
.
  
<EOS>
So
,
my
lady
,
I
shall
now
-
and
-
then
pay
my
respects
to
you
in
the
writing
way
,
though
I
must
address
myself
,
it
seems
,
to
my
dearest
Mr.
B.
;
and
I
hope
to
be
received
on
these
my
own
terms
,
since
they
are
your
brother
's
also
,
and
,
at
the
same
time
,
such
as
will
convince
you
,
how
much
I
wish
to
approve
myself
,
to
the
best
of
my
poor
ability
,
your
ladyship
's
most
obliged
sister
,
and
humble
servant
,
  
P.B.
    
<EOS>
My
dearest
Mr.
B.
,
  
I
have
been
considering
of
your
commands
,
in
relation
to
Mr.
Locke
's
book
,
and
since
you
are
pleased
to
give
me
time
to
acquit
myself
of
the
task
,
I
shall
beg
to
include
in
a
little
book
my
humble
sentiments
,
as
I
did
to
Lady
Davers
,
<EOS>
in
that
I
shewed
you
in
relation
to
the
plays
I
had
seen
.
<EOS>
And
since
you
confine
me
not
to
time
or
place
,
I
may
be
three
or
four
years
in
completing
it
,
because
I
shall
reserve
some
subjects
to
my
further
experience
in
children
's
ways
and
tempers
,
and
in
order
to
benefit
myself
by
the
good
instructions
I
shall
receive
from
your
delightful
conversation
,
in
that
compass
of
time
,
if
God
spare
us
to
one
another
:
and
then
it
will
,
moreover
,
be
still
worthier
of
the
perusal
of
the
most
honoured
and
best
beloved
of
all
my
correspondents
,
much
honoured
and
beloved
as
they
all
are
.
  
<EOS>
I
must
needs
say
,
my
dear
Mr.
B.
,
that
this
is
a
subject
to
which
I
was
always
particularly
attentive
;
and
among
the
charities
your
bountiful
heart
permits
me
to
dispense
to
the
poor
and
indigent
,
I
have
had
always
a
watchful
eye
upon
the
children
of
such
,
and
endeavoured
,
by
questions
put
to
them
,
as
well
as
to
their
parents
,
to
inform
myself
of
their
little
ways
and
tempers
,
and
how
nature
delights
to
work
in
different
minds
,
and
how
it
might
be
pointed
to
their
good
,
according
to
their
respective
capacities
;
and
I
have
for
this
purpose
erected
,
with
your
approbation
,
a
little
school
of
seven
or
eight
children
,
among
which
is
four
in
the
earliest
stages
,
when
they
can
but
just
speak
,
and
call
for
what
they
want
and
love
:
<EOS>
and
I
am
not
a
little
pleased
to
observe
,
when
I
visit
them
in
their
school
time
that
principles
of
goodness
and
virtue
may
be
instilled
into
their
little
hearts
much
earlier
than
is
usually
imagined
.
<EOS>
And
why
should
it
not
be
so
?
<EOS>
for
may
not
the
child
,
that
can
tell
its
wants
,
and
make
known
its
inclination
,
be
easily
made
sensible
of
yours
,
and
what
you
expect
from
it
,
provided
you
take
a
proper
method
?
<EOS>
For
,
sometimes
,
signs
and
tokens
(
and
even
looks
)
,
uniformly
practised
,
will
do
as
well
as
words
;
as
we
see
in
such
of
the
young
of
the
brute
creation
as
we
are
disposed
to
domesticate
,
and
to
teach
to
practise
those
little
tricks
,
of
which
the
aptness
or
docility
of
their
natures
makes
them
capable
.
  
<EOS>
But
yet
,
dearest
Sir
,
I
know
not
enough
of
the
next
stage
,
the
maturer
part
of
life
,
to
touch
upon
that
as
I
wish
to
do
:
<EOS>
and
yet
there
is
a
natural
connection
and
progression
from
the
one
to
the
other
:
and
I
would
not
be
thought
a
vain
creature
,
who
believes
herself
equal
to
every
subject
,
because
she
is
indulged
with
the
good
opinion
of
her
friends
,
in
a
few
,
which
are
supposed
to
be
within
her
own
capacity
.
  
<EOS>
For
,
I
humbly
conceive
,
that
it
is
no
small
point
of
wisdom
to
know
,
and
not
to
mistake
,
one
's
own
talents
:
<EOS>
and
for
this
reason
,
permit
me
,
Sir
,
to
suspend
,
till
I
am
better
qualified
for
it
,
even
my
own
proposal
of
beginning
my
little
book
;
and
,
in
the
mean
time
,
to
touch
upon
a
few
places
of
the
admirable
author
,
that
seem
to
me
to
warrant
another
way
of
thinking
,
than
that
which
he
prescribes
.
  
<EOS>
But
,
dear
Sir
,
let
me
premise
,
that
all
that
your
dear
babies
can
demand
of
my
attention
for
some
time
to
come
,
is
their
health
;
and
God
has
blessed
them
with
such
sound
limbs
,
and
,
to
all
appearances
,
good
constitutions
,
that
I
have
very
little
to
do
,
but
to
pray
for
them
every
time
I
pray
for
their
dear
papa
;
and
that
is
hourly
;
and
yet
not
so
often
as
you
confer
upon
me
benefits
and
favours
,
and
new
obligations
,
even
to
the
prevention
of
all
my
wishes
,
were
I
to
sit
down
and
study
for
what
must
be
the
next
.
  
<EOS>
As
to
this
point
of
health
,
Mr.
Locke
gives
these
plain
and
easy
to
be
observed
rules
.
  
<EOS>
He
prescribes
first
,
plenty
of
open
air
.
<EOS>
That
this
is
right
,
the
infant
will
inform
one
,
who
,
though
it
can
not
speak
,
will
make
signs
to
be
carried
abroad
,
and
is
never
so
well
pleased
,
as
when
enjoying
the
open
and
free
air
;
for
which
reason
I
conclude
,
that
this
is
one
of
those
natural
pointings
,
as
I
may
say
,
that
are
implanted
in
every
creature
,
teaching
it
to
choose
its
good
,
and
to
avoid
its
evil
.
  
<EOS>
Sleep
is
the
next
,
which
he
enjoins
to
be
indulged
to
its
utmost
extent
:
an
admirable
rule
,
as
I
humbly
conceive
;
since
sound
sleep
is
one
of
the
greatest
nourishers
of
nature
,
both
to
the
once
young
and
to
the
twice
young
,
if
I
may
use
the
phrase
.
<EOS>
And
I
the
rather
approve
of
this
rule
,
because
it
keeps
the
nurse
unemployed
,
who
otherwise
may
be
doing
it
the
greatest
mischief
,
by
cramming
and
stuffing
its
little
bowels
,
till
ready
to
burst
.
<EOS>
And
,
if
I
am
right
,
what
an
inconsiderate
and
foolish
,
as
well
as
pernicious
practice
it
is
,
for
a
nurse
to
waken
the
child
from
its
nourishing
sleep
,
for
fear
it
should
suffer
by
hunger
,
and
instantly
pop
the
breast
into
its
pretty
mouth
,
or
provoke
it
to
feed
,
when
it
has
no
inclination
to
either
,
and
for
want
of
digestion
,
must
have
its
nutriment
turned
to
repletion
,
and
bad
humours
!
  
<EOS>
Excuse
me
,
dear
Sir
,
these
lesser
particulars
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Locke
begins
with
them
;
and
surely
they
may
be
allowed
in
a
young
mamma
,
writing
(
however
it
be
to
a
gentleman
of
genius
and
learning
)
to
a
papa
,
on
a
subject
,
that
in
its
lowest
beginnings
ought
not
to
be
unattended
to
by
either
.
<EOS>
I
will
therefore
pursue
my
excellent
author
without
farther
apology
,
since
you
have
put
his
work
into
my
hands
.
  
<EOS>
The
next
thing
,
then
,
which
he
prescribes
,
is
plain
diet
.
<EOS>
This
speaks
for
itself
,
for
the
baby
can
have
no
corrupt
taste
to
gratify
:
all
is
pure
,
as
out
of
the
hand
of
Nature
;
and
what
is
not
plain
and
natural
,
must
vitiate
and
offend
.
  
<EOS>
Then
,
no
wine
,
or
strong
drink
.
<EOS>
Equally
just
;
and
for
the
same
reasons
.
  
<EOS>
Little
or
no
physic
.
<EOS>
Undoubtedly
right
.
<EOS>
For
the
use
of
physic
,
without
necessity
,
or
by
way
of
precaution
,
as
some
call
it
,
begets
the
necessity
of
physic
;
and
the
very
word
supposes
distemper
or
disorder
;
and
where
there
is
none
,
would
a
parent
beget
one
;
or
,
by
frequent
use
,
render
the
salutary
force
of
medicine
ineffectual
,
when
it
was
wanted
?
  
<EOS>
Next
,
he
forbids
too
warm
and
too
strait
clothing
.
<EOS>
This
is
just
as
I
wish
it
.
<EOS>
How
often
has
my
heart
ached
,
when
I
have
seen
poor
babies
rolled
and
swathed
,
<EOS>
ten
or
a
dozen
times
round
;
then
blanket
upon
blanket
,
mantle
upon
that
;
its
little
neck
pinned
down
to
one
posture
;
its
head
,
more
than
it
frequently
needs
,
triple
-
crowned
like
a
young
pope
,
with
covering
upon
covering
;
its
legs
and
arms
,
as
if
to
prevent
that
kindly
stretching
,
which
we
rather
ought
to
promote
,
when
it
is
in
health
,
and
which
is
only
aiming
at
growth
and
enlargement
,
the
former
bundled
up
,
the
latter
pinned
down
;
and
how
the
poor
thing
lies
on
the
nurse
's
lap
,
a
miserable
little
pinioned
captive
,
goggling
and
staring
with
its
eyes
,
the
only
organ
it
has
at
liberty
,
as
if
supplicating
for
freedom
to
its
fettered
limbs
!
<EOS>
Nor
has
it
any
comfort
at
all
,
till
with
a
sigh
or
two
,
like
a
dying
deer
,
it
drops
asleep
;
and
happy
then
will
it
be
till
the
officious
nurse
's
care
shall
awaken
it
for
its
undesired
food
,
as
if
resolved
to
try
its
constitution
,
and
willing
to
see
how
many
difficulties
it
could
overcome
.
  
<EOS>
Then
he
advises
,
that
the
head
and
feet
should
be
kept
cold
;
and
the
latter
often
used
to
cold
water
,
and
exposed
to
wet
,
in
order
to
lay
the
foundation
,
as
he
says
,
of
an
healthy
and
hardy
constitution
.
  
<EOS>
Now
,
Sir
,
what
a
pleasure
<EOS>
it
is
to
your
Pamela
,
that
her
notions
,
and
her
practice
too
,
fall
in
so
exactly
with
this
learned
gentleman
's
advice
that
,
excepting
one
article
,
which
is
,
that
your
Billy
has
not
yet
been
accustomed
to
be
wet
-
shod
,
every
other
particular
has
been
observed
!
<EOS>
And
do
n't
you
see
what
a
charming
,
charming
baby
he
is
?
 
<EOS>
Nay
,
and
so
is
your
little
Davers
,
for
his
age
 
pretty
soul
!
  
<EOS>
Perhaps
some
,
were
they
to
see
this
,
would
not
be
so
ready
,
as
I
know
you
will
be
,
to
excuse
me
;
and
would
be
apt
to
say
,
"
What
nursery
impertinences
are
these
to
trouble
a
man
with
!
"
 
<EOS>
But
with
all
their
wisdom
,
they
would
be
mistaken
;
for
if
a
child
has
not
good
health
,
(
and
are
not
these
rules
the
moral
foundation
,
as
I
may
say
,
of
that
blessing
?
)
<EOS>
its
animal
organs
will
play
but
poorly
in
a
weak
or
crazy
case
.
<EOS>
These
,
therefore
,
are
necessary
rules
to
be
observed
for
the
first
two
or
three
years
:
for
then
the
little
buds
of
their
minds
will
begin
to
open
,
and
their
watchful
mamma
will
be
employed
like
a
skilful
gardener
,
in
assisting
and
encouraging
the
charming
flower
through
its
several
hopeful
stages
to
perfection
,
when
it
shall
become
one
of
the
principal
ornaments
of
that
delicate
garden
,
your
honoured
family
.
<EOS>
Pardon
me
,
Sir
,
if
in
the
above
paragraph
I
am
too
figurative
.
<EOS>
I
begin
to
be
afraid
I
am
out
of
my
sphere
,
writing
to
your
dear
self
,
on
these
important
subjects
.
  
<EOS>
But
be
that
as
it
may
,
I
will
here
put
an
end
to
this
my
first
letter
(
on
the
earliest
part
of
my
subject
)
,
rejoicing
in
the
opportunity
you
have
given
me
of
producing
a
fresh
instance
of
that
duty
and
affection
,
wherewith
I
am
,
and
shall
ever
be
,
my
dearest
Mr.
B.
,
your
grateful
,
happy
,
  
<EOS>
P.B.
    
I
will
now
,
my
dearest
,
my
best
beloved
correspondent
of
all
,
begin
,
since
the
tender
age
of
my
dear
babies
will
not
permit
me
to
have
an
eye
yet
to
their
better
part
,
to
tell
you
what
are
the
little
matters
to
which
I
am
not
quite
so
well
reconciled
in
Mr.
Locke
:
and
this
I
shall
be
better
enabled
to
do
,
by
my
observations
upon
the
temper
and
natural
bent
of
my
dear
Miss
Goodwin
,
as
well
as
by
those
which
my
visits
to
the
bigger
children
of
my
little
school
,
and
those
at
the
cottages
adjacent
,
have
enabled
me
to
make
;
for
human
nature
,
Sir
,
you
are
not
to
be
told
,
is
human
nature
,
whether
in
the
high
-
born
,
or
in
the
low
.
  
<EOS>
This
excellent
author
(
Section
52
)
,
having
justly
disallowed
of
slavish
and
corporal
punishments
in
the
education
of
those
we
would
have
to
be
wise
,
good
,
and
ingenuous
men
,
adds
,
"
On
the
other
side
,
to
flatter
children
by
rewards
of
things
that
are
pleasant
to
them
,
is
as
carefully
to
be
avoided
.
<EOS>
He
that
will
give
his
son
apples
,
or
sugar
-
plums
,
or
what
else
of
this
kind
<EOS>
he
is
most
delighted
with
,
to
make
him
learn
his
book
,
does
but
authorize
his
love
of
pleasure
,
and
cockers
up
that
dangerous
propensity
,
which
he
ought
,
by
all
means
,
to
subdue
and
stifle
in
him
.
<EOS>
You
can
never
hope
to
teach
him
to
master
it
,
whilst
you
compound
for
the
check
you
give
his
inclination
in
one
place
,
by
the
satisfaction
you
propose
to
it
in
another

<EOS>
To
make
a
good
,
a
wise
,
and
a
virtuous
man
,
'
tis
fit
he
should
learn
to
cross
his
appetite
,
and
deny
his
inclination
to
riches
,
finery
,
or
pleasing
his
palate
,
&
c.
"
  
<EOS>
This
,
Sir
,
is
well
said
;
but
is
it
not
a
little
too
philosophical
and
abstracted
,
not
only
for
the
generality
of
children
,
but
for
the
age
he
supposes
them
to
be
of
,
if
one
may
guess
by
the
apples
and
the
sugar
-
plums
proposed
for
the
rewards
of
their
well
-
doing
?
 
<EOS>
Would
not
this
require
that
memory
or
reflection
in
children
,
which
,
in
another
place
,
is
called
the
concomitant
of
prudence
and
age
,
and
not
of
childhood
?
  
<EOS>
It
is
undoubtedly
very
right
,
to
check
an
unreasonable
appetite
,
and
that
at
its
first
appearance
.
<EOS>
But
if
so
small
and
so
reasonable
an
inducement
will
prevail
,
surely
,
Sir
,
it
might
be
complied
with
.
<EOS>
A
generous
mind
takes
delight
to
win
over
others
by
good
usage
and
mildness
,
rather
than
by
severity
;
and
it
must
be
a
great
pain
to
such
an
one
,
to
be
always
inculcating
,
on
his
children
or
pupils
,
the
doctrine
of
self
-
denial
,
by
methods
quite
grievous
to
his
own
nature
.
  
<EOS>
What
I
would
then
humbly
propose
,
is
,
that
the
encouragements
offered
to
youth
,
should
,
indeed
,
be
innocent
ones
,
as
the
gentleman
enjoins
,
and
not
such
as
would
lead
to
luxury
,
either
of
food
or
apparel
;
but
I
humbly
think
it
necessary
,
that
rewards
,
proper
rewards
,
should
be
proposed
as
incentives
to
laudable
actions
:
for
is
it
not
by
this
method
that
the
whole
world
is
influenced
and
governed
?
<EOS>
Does
not
God
himself
,
by
rewards
and
punishments
,
make
it
our
interest
,
as
well
as
our
duty
,
to
obey
him
?
<EOS>
And
can
we
propose
ourselves
,
for
the
government
of
our
children
,
a
better
example
than
that
of
the
Creator
?
  
<EOS>
This
fine
author
seems
to
think
he
had
been
a
little
of
the
strictest
,
and
liable
to
some
exception
.
<EOS>
"
I
say
not
this
,
"
proceeds
he
,
(
Section
53
)
"
that
I
would
have
children
kept
from
the
conveniences
or
pleasures
of
life
,
that
are
not
injurious
to
their
health
or
virtue
.
<EOS>
On
the
contrary
,
I
would
have
their
lives
made
as
pleasant
and
as
agreeable
to
them
as
may
be
,
in
a
plentiful
enjoyment
of
whatsoever
might
innocently
delight
them
.
<EOS>
"-And
<EOS>
yet
he
immediately
subjoins
a
very
hard
and
difficult
proviso
to
this
indulgence
.
 
<EOS>
"
Provided
,
"
says
he
,
"
it
be
with
this
caution
,
that
they
have
those
enjoyments
only
as
the
consequences
of
the
state
of
esteem
and
acceptation
they
are
in
with
their
parents
and
governors
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
doubt
,
my
dear
Mr.
B.
,
this
is
expecting
such
a
distinction
and
discretion
in
children
,
as
they
seldom
have
in
their
tender
years
,
and
requiring
capacities
not
commonly
to
be
met
with
;
so
that
it
is
not
prescribing
to
the
generality
,
as
this
excellent
author
intended
.
'
<EOS>
Tis
,
I
humbly
conceive
,
next
to
impossible
that
their
tender
minds
should
distinguish
beyond
facts
;
they
covet
this
or
that
play
-
thing
,
and
the
parent
,
or
governor
,
takes
advantage
of
its
desires
,
and
annexes
to
the
indulgence
such
or
such
a
task
or
duty
,
as
a
condition
;
and
shews
himself
pleased
with
its
compliance
with
it
:
so
the
child
wins
its
plaything
,
and
receives
the
commendation
so
necessary
to
lead
on
young
minds
to
laudable
pursuits
.
<EOS>
But
shall
it
not
be
suffered
to
enjoy
the
innocent
reward
of
its
compliance
,
unless
it
can
give
satisfaction
,
that
its
greatest
delight
is
not
in
having
the
thing
coveted
,
but
in
performing
the
task
,
or
obeying
the
injunctions
imposed
upon
it
as
a
condition
of
its
being
obliged
?
<EOS>
I
doubt
,
Sir
,
this
is
a
little
too
strict
,
and
not
to
be
expected
from
children
.
<EOS>
A
servant
,
full
-
grown
,
would
not
be
able
to
shew
,
that
,
on
condition
he
complied
with
such
and
such
terms
(
which
,
it
is
to
be
supposed
by
the
offer
,
he
would
not
have
complied
with
,
but
for
that
inducement
)
,
he
should
have
such
and
such
a
reward
;
  
<EOS>
I
say
,
he
would
hardly
be
able
to
shew
,
that
he
preferred
the
pleasure
of
performing
the
requisite
conditions
to
the
stipulated
reward
.
<EOS>
Nor
is
it
necessary
he
should
:
for
he
is
not
the
less
a
good
servant
,
or
a
virtuous
man
,
if
he
own
the
conditions
painful
,
and
the
reward
necessary
to
his
low
state
in
the
world
,
and
that
otherwise
he
would
not
undergo
any
service
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
Why
then
should
this
be
exacted
from
a
child
?
  
<EOS>
Let
,
therefore
,
innocent
rewards
be
proposed
,
and
let
us
be
contented
to
lead
on
the
ductile
minds
of
children
to
a
love
of
their
duty
,
by
obliging
them
with
such
:
we
may
tell
them
what
we
expect
in
this
case
;
but
we
ought
not
,
I
humbly
conceive
,
to
be
too
rigorous
in
exacting
it
;
for
,
after
all
,
the
inducement
will
naturally
be
the
uppermost
consideration
with
the
child
:
not
,
as
I
hinted
,
had
it
been
offered
to
it
,
if
the
parent
himself
had
not
thought
so
.
<EOS>
And
,
therefore
,
we
can
only
let
the
child
know
his
duty
in
this
respect
,
and
that
he
ought
to
give
a
preference
to
that
;
and
then
rest
ourselves
contented
,
although
we
should
discern
,
that
the
reward
is
the
chief
incentive
,
of
it
.
<EOS>
For
this
,
from
whatever
motive
inculcated
,
may
beget
a
habit
in
the
child
of
doing
it
:
and
then
,
as
it
improves
in
years
,
one
may
hope
,
that
reason
will
take
place
,
and
enable
him
,
from
the
most
solid
and
durable
motives
,
to
give
a
preference
to
the
duty
.
  
<EOS>
Upon
the
whole
,
then
,
can
we
insist
upon
it
,
that
the
child
should
so
nicely
distinguish
away
its
little
innate
passions
,
as
if
we
expected
it
to
be
born
a
philosopher
?
<EOS>
Self
-
denial
is
,
indeed
,
a
most
excellent
doctrine
to
be
inculcated
into
children
,
and
it
must
be
done
early
:
but
we
must
not
be
too
severe
in
our
exacting
it
;
for
a
duty
too
rigidly
insisted
upon
,
will
make
it
odious
.
<EOS>
This
Mr.
Locke
,
too
,
observes
in
another
place
,
on
the
head
of
too
great
severity
;
which
he
illustrates
by
a
familiar
comparison
:
"
Offensive
circumstances
,
"
says
he
,
"
ordinarily
infect
innocent
things
which
they
are
joined
with
.
<EOS>
And
the
very
sight
of
a
cup
,
wherein
any
one
uses
to
take
nauseous
physic
,
turns
his
stomach
;
so
that
nothing
will
relish
well
out
of
it
,
though
the
cup
be
never
so
clean
and
well
-
shaped
,
and
of
the
richest
materials
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Permit
me
to
add
,
that
Mr.
Locke
writes
still
more
rigorously
on
the
subject
of
rewards
;
which
I
quote
,
to
shew
I
have
not
misunderstood
him
:
"
But
these
enjoyments
,
"
says
he
,
"
should
never
be
offered
or
bestowed
on
children
,
as
the
rewards
of
this
or
that
particular
performance
that
they
shew
an
aversion
to
,
or
to
which
they
would
not
have
applied
themselves
without
that
temptation
.
<EOS>
"
If
,
dear
Sir
,
the
minds
of
children
can
be
led
on
by
innocent
inducements
to
the
performance
of
a
duty
,
of
which
they
are
capable
,
what
I
have
humbly
offered
,
is
enough
,
I
presume
,
to
convince
one
,
that
it
may
be
done
.
<EOS>
But
if
ever
a
particular
study
be
proposed
to
be
mastered
,
or
a
bias
to
be
overcome
(
that
is
not
an
indispensable
requisite
to
his
future
life
of
morals
)
to
which
the
child
shews
an
aversion
,
I
would
not
,
methinks
,
have
him
be
too
much
tempted
or
compelled
to
conquer
or
subdue
it
,
especially
if
it
appear
to
be
a
natural
or
rivetted
aversion
.
<EOS>
For
,
permit
me
to
observe
,
that
the
education
and
studies
of
children
ought
,
as
much
as
possible
,
to
be
suited
to
their
capacities
and
inclination
,
and
,
by
these
means
,
we
may
expect
to
have
always
useful
and
often
great
men
,
in
different
professions
;
for
that
genius
which
does
not
prompt
to
the
prosecution
of
one
study
,
may
shine
in
another
no
less
necessary
part
of
science
.
<EOS>
But
,
if
the
promise
of
innocent
rewards
would
conquer
this
aversion
,
yet
they
should
not
be
applied
with
this
view
;
for
the
best
consequences
that
can
be
hoped
for
,
will
be
tolerable
skill
in
one
thing
,
instead
of
most
excellent
in
another
.
  
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
I
must
repeat
,
that
if
,
as
the
child
grows
up
,
and
is
capable
of
so
much
reason
,
that
,
from
the
love
of
the
inducement
,
one
can
raise
his
mind
to
the
love
of
the
duty
,
it
should
be
done
by
all
means
.
<EOS>
But
,
my
dear
Mr.
B.
,
I
am
afraid
that
that
parent
or
tutor
will
meet
with
but
<EOS>
little
success
,
who
,
in
a
child
's
tender
years
,
shall
refuse
to
comply
with
its
foibles
,
till
he
sees
it
value
its
duty
,
and
the
pleasure
of
obeying
his
commands
,
beyond
the
little
enjoyment
on
which
his
heart
is
fixed
.
<EOS>
For
,
as
I
humbly
conceive
,
that
mind
which
can
be
brought
to
prefer
its
duty
to
its
appetites
,
will
want
little
of
the
perfection
of
the
wisest
philosophers
.
  
<EOS>
Besides
,
Sir
,
permit
to
me
say
,
that
I
am
afraid
this
perpetual
opposition
between
the
passions
of
the
child
and
the
duty
to
be
enforced
,
especially
when
it
sees
how
other
children
are
indulged
<EOS>
(
for
if
this
regimen
could
be
observed
by
any
,
it
would
be
impossible
it
should
become
general
,
while
the
fond
and
the
inconsiderate
parents
are
so
large
a
part
of
mankind
)
,
will
cow
and
dispirit
a
child
,
and
will
,
perhaps
produce
,
a
necessity
of
making
use
of
severity
,
to
subdue
him
to
this
temper
of
self
-
denial
;
for
if
the
child
refuses
,
the
parent
must
insist
;
and
what
will
be
the
consequence
?
<EOS>
must
it
not
introduce
a
harsher
discipline
than
this
gentleman
allows
of
?
 
<EOS>
and
which
,
I
presume
to
say
,
did
never
yet
do
good
to
any
but
to
slavish
and
base
spirits
,
if
to
them
;
a
discipline
which
Mr.
Locke
every
where
justly
condemns
.
  
<EOS>
See
here
,
dear
Sir
,
a
specimen
of
the
presumption
of
your
girl
:
"
What
will
she
come
to
in
time
!
<EOS>
"
you
will
perhaps
say
,
"
Her
next
step
will
be
to
arraign
myself
.
"
<EOS>
No
,
no
,
dear
Sir
,
do
n't
think
so
:
for
my
duty
,
my
love
,
and
my
reverence
,
shall
be
your
guards
,
and
defend
you
from
every
thing
saucy
in
me
,
but
the
bold
approaches
of
my
gratitude
,
winch
shall
always
testify
for
me
,
how
much
I
am
your
obliged
and
dutiful
servant
,
  
P.B.
    
MY
DEAREST
MR
.
<EOS>
B.
,
  
I
will
continue
my
subject
,
although
I
have
not
had
an
opportunity
to
know
whether
you
approve
of
my
notions
or
not
by
reason
of
the
excursions
you
have
been
pleased
to
allow
me
to
make
in
your
beloved
company
to
the
sea
-
ports
of
this
kingdom
,
and
to
the
more
noted
inland
towns
of
Essex
,
Kent
,
Sussex
,
Hampshire
,
and
Dorsetshire
,
which
have
given
me
infinite
delight
and
pleasure
,
and
enlarged
my
notions
of
the
wealth
and
power
of
the
kingdom
,
in
which
God
's
goodness
has
given
you
so
considerable
a
stake
.
  
<EOS>
My
next
topic
will
be
upon
a
home
education
,
which
Mr.
Locke
prefers
,
for
several
weighty
reasons
,
to
a
school
one
,
provided
such
a
tutor
can
be
procured
,
as
he
makes
next
to
an
impossibility
to
procure
.
<EOS>
The
gentleman
has
set
forth
the
inconveniencies
of
both
,
and
was
himself
so
discouraged
,
on
a
review
of
them
,
that
he
was
ready
,
as
he
says
,
to
throw
up
his
pen
.
<EOS>
My
chief
cares
,
dear
Sir
,
on
this
head
,
are
three
<EOS>
:
1st
,
The
difficulty
which
,
as
I
said
,
Mr.
Locke
makes
almost
insuperable
,
to
find
a
qualified
tutor
.
<EOS>
2ndly
,
The
necessity
there
is
,
according
to
Mr.
Locke
,
of
keeping
the
youth
out
of
the
company
of
the
meaner
servants
,
who
may
set
him
bad
examples
.
<EOS>
And
,
3rdly
,
Those
still
greater
difficulties
which
will
arise
from
the
example
of
his
parents
,
if
they
are
not
very
discreet
and
circumspect
.
  
<EOS>
As
to
the
qualifications
of
the
tutor
,
Mr.
Locke
supposes
,
that
he
is
to
be
so
learned
,
so
discreet
,
so
wise
,
in
short
,
so
perfect
a
man
,
that
I
doubt
,
and
so
does
Mr.
Locke
,
such
an
one
can
hardly
be
met
with
for
this
humble
and
slavish
employment
.
<EOS>
I
presume
,
Sir
,
to
call
it
so
,
because
of
the
too
little
regard
that
is
generally
paid
to
these
useful
men
in
the
families
of
the
great
,
where
they
are
frequently
put
upon
a
foot
with
the
uppermost
servants
,
and
the
rather
,
if
they
happen
to
be
men
of
modesty
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
,
"
says
he
,
"
from
children
's
first
beginning
to
talk
,
have
some
discreet
,
sober
,
nay
,
wise
person
about
them
,
whose
care
it
should
be
to
fashion
them
right
,
and
to
keep
them
from
all
ill
;
especially
the
infection
of
bad
company
.
<EOS>
I
think
this
province
requires
great
sobriety
,
temperance
,
tenderness
,
diligence
,
and
discretion
;
qualities
hardly
to
be
found
united
in
persons
that
are
to
be
had
for
ordinary
salaries
,
nor
easily
to
be
found
any
where
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
If
this
,
Sir
,
be
the
case
,
does
not
this
excellent
author
recommend
a
scheme
that
is
rendered
in
a
manner
impracticable
from
this
difficulty
?
  
<EOS>
As
to
these
qualities
being
more
rarely
to
be
met
with
in
persons
that
are
to
be
had
for
ordinary
salaries
,
I
can
not
help
being
of
opinion
(
although
,
with
Mr.
Locke
,
I
think
no
expence
should
be
spared
,
if
that
would
do
)
that
there
is
as
good
a
chance
for
finding
a
proper
person
among
the
needy
scholars
(
if
not
of
a
low
and
sordid
turn
of
mind
)
<EOS>
as
among
the
more
affluent
:
because
the
narrow
circumstances
of
the
former
(
which
probably
became
a
spur
to
his
own
improvement
)
will
,
it
is
likely
,
at
first
setting
out
in
the
world
,
make
him
be
glad
to
embrace
such
an
offer
in
a
family
which
has
interest
enough
to
prefer
him
,
and
will
quicken
his
diligence
to
make
him
deserve
preferment
;
and
if
such
an
one
wanted
any
of
that
requisite
politeness
,
which
some
would
naturally
expect
from
scholars
of
better
fortune
,
might
not
that
be
supplied
to
the
youth
by
the
conversation
of
parents
,
relations
,
and
visitors
,
in
conjunction
with
those
other
helps
which
young
men
of
family
and
large
expectations
constantly
have
,
and
which
few
learned
tutors
can
give
him
?
  
<EOS>
I
say
not
this
to
countenance
the
wretched
niggardliness
(
which
this
gentleman
justly
censures
)
of
those
who
grudge
a
handsome
consideration
to
so
necessary
and
painful
a
labour
as
that
of
a
tutor
,
which
,
where
a
deserving
man
can
be
met
with
,
can
not
be
too
genteelly
rewarded
,
nor
himself
too
respectfully
treated
.
<EOS>
I
only
beg
to
deliver
my
opinion
,
that
a
low
condition
is
as
likely
as
any
other
,
with
a
mind
not
ungenerous
,
to
produce
a
man
who
has
these
good
qualities
,
as
well
for
the
reasons
I
have
hinted
at
,
as
for
others
which
might
be
mentioned
.
  
<EOS>
But
Mr.
Locke
thus
proceeds
:
"
To
form
a
young
gentleman
as
he
should
be
,
'
tis
fit
his
governor
should
be
well
bred
,
understand
the
ways
of
carriage
,
and
measures
of
civility
,
in
all
the
variety
of
persons
,
times
,
and
places
and
keep
his
pupil
,
as
far
as
his
age
requires
,
constantly
to
the
observation
of
them
.
<EOS>
This
is
an
art
not
to
be
learnt
or
taught
by
books
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
can
give
it
but
good
company
and
observation
joined
together
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
in
another
place
says
,
"
Besides
being
well
-
bred
,
the
tutor
should
know
the
world
well
;
the
ways
,
the
humours
,
the
follies
,
the
cheats
,
the
faults
of
the
age
he
has
fallen
into
,
and
particularly
of
the
country
he
lives
in
:
these
he
should
be
able
to
shew
to
his
pupil
,
as
he
finds
him
capable
;
teach
him
skill
in
men
and
their
manners
;
pull
off
the
mask
which
their
several
callings
and
pretences
cover
them
with
;
and
make
his
pupil
discern
what
lies
at
the
bottom
,
under
such
appearances
,
that
he
may
not
,
as
unexperienced
young
men
are
apt
to
do
,
if
they
are
unwarned
,
take
one
thing
for
another
,
judge
by
the
outside
,
and
give
himself
up
to
show
,
and
the
insinuations
of
a
fair
carriage
,
or
an
obliging
application
;
teach
him
to
guess
at
,
and
beware
of
,
the
designs
of
men
he
hath
to
do
with
,
neither
with
too
much
suspicion
,
nor
too
much
confidence
.
"
  
<EOS>
This
,
dear
Sir
,
is
excellently
said
:
'
tis
noble
theory
;
and
if
the
tutor
be
a
man
void
of
resentment
and
caprice
,
and
will
not
be
governed
by
partial
considerations
,
in
his
own
judgment
of
persons
and
things
,
all
will
be
well
:
<EOS>
but
if
otherwise
,
may
he
not
take
advantage
of
the
confidence
placed
in
him
,
to
the
injury
of
some
worthy
person
,
and
by
degrees
monopolize
the
young
gentleman
to
himself
,
and
govern
his
passions
as
absolutely
,
as
I
have
heard
some
first
ministers
have
done
those
of
their
prince
,
equally
to
his
own
personal
disreputation
,
and
to
the
disadvantage
of
his
people
?
<EOS>
But
all
this
,
and
much
more
,
according
to
Mr.
Locke
,
is
the
duty
of
a
tutor
:
and
on
the
finding
out
such
an
one
,
depends
his
scheme
of
a
home
education
.
<EOS>
No
wonder
,
then
,
that
he
himself
says
,
"
When
I
consider
the
scruples
and
cautions
I
here
lay
in
your
way
,
methinks
it
looks
as
if
I
advised
you
to
something
which
I
would
have
offered
at
,
but
in
effect
not
done
,
"
&
c.
 
Permit
me
,
dear
Sir
,
in
this
place
to
express
my
fear
that
it
is
hardly
possible
for
any
one
,
with
talents
inferior
to
those
of
Mr.
Locke
himself
,
to
come
up
to
the
rules
he
has
laid
down
upon
this
subject
;
and
'
tis
to
be
questioned
,
whether
even
he
,
with
all
that
vast
stock
of
natural
reason
and
solid
sense
,
for
which
,
as
you
tell
me
,
Sir
,
he
was
so
famous
,
had
attained
to
these
perfections
,
at
his
first
setting
out
into
life
.
  
<EOS>
Now
,
therefore
,
dear
Sir
,
you
ca
n't
imagine
how
these
difficulties
perplex
me
,
as
to
my
knowing
how
to
judge
which
is
best
,
a
home
or
a
school
education
.
<EOS>
For
hear
what
this
excellent
author
justly
observes
on
the
latter
,
among
other
things
,
no
less
to
the
purpose
:
"
I
am
sure
,
he
who
is
able
to
be
at
the
charge
of
a
tutor
at
home
,
may
there
give
his
son
a
more
genteel
carriage
,
more
manly
thoughts
,
and
a
sense
of
what
is
worthy
and
becoming
,
with
a
greater
proficiency
in
learning
,
into
the
bargain
,
and
ripen
him
up
sooner
into
a
man
,
than
any
school
can
do
.
<EOS>
Not
that
I
blame
the
schoolmaster
in
this
,
"
says
he
,
"
or
think
it
to
be
laid
to
his
charge
.
<EOS>
The
difference
is
great
between
two
or
three
pupils
in
the
same
house
,
and
three
or
four
score
boys
lodged
up
and
down
;
for
,
let
the
master
's
industry
and
skill
be
never
so
great
<EOS>
,
it
is
impossible
he
should
have
fifty
or
an
hundred
scholars
under
his
eye
any
longer
than
they
are
in
the
school
together
.
"
<EOS>
But
then
,
Sir
,
if
there
be
such
a
difficulty
as
Mr.
Locke
says
,
to
meet
with
a
proper
tutor
for
the
home
education
,
which
he
thus
prefers
,
what
a
perplexing
thing
is
this
.
<EOS>
But
still
,
according
to
this
gentleman
,
another
difficulty
attends
a
home
education
;
and
that
is
,
what
I
hinted
at
before
,
in
my
second
article
,
the
necessity
of
keeping
the
youth
out
of
the
company
of
the
meaner
servants
,
who
may
set
him
bad
examples
.
<EOS>
For
thus
he
says
,
"
Here
is
another
great
inconvenience
,
which
children
receive
from
the
ill
examples
which
they
meet
with
from
the
meaner
servants
.
<EOS>
They
are
wholly
,
if
possible
,
to
be
kept
from
such
conversation
:
for
the
contagion
of
these
ill
precedents
,
both
in
civility
and
virtue
,
horribly
infects
children
,
as
often
as
they
come
within
the
reach
of
it
.
<EOS>
They
frequently
learn
from
unbred
or
debauched
servants
,
such
language
,
untowardly
tricks
and
vices
,
as
otherwise
they
would
be
ignorant
of
all
their
lives
.
'
<EOS>
Tis
a
hard
matter
wholly
to
prevent
this
mischief
,
"
continues
he
;
"
you
will
have
very
good
luck
,
if
you
never
have
a
clownish
or
vicious
servant
,
and
if
from
them
your
children
never
get
any
infection
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Then
,
Sir
,
my
third
point
(
which
I
mentioned
in
the
beginning
of
this
letter
)
makes
a
still
stronger
objection
,
as
it
may
happen
,
against
a
home
education
;
to
wit
,
the
example
of
the
parents
themselves
,
if
they
be
not
very
circumspect
and
discreet
.
  
<EOS>
All
these
difficulties
being
put
together
,
let
me
,
dear
Sir
,
humbly
propose
it
,
as
a
matter
for
your
consideration
and
determination
,
whether
there
be
not
a
middle
way
to
be
found
out
in
a
school
education
,
that
may
remedy
some
of
these
inconveniencies
?
<EOS>
For
suppose
you
can
not
get
a
tutor
so
qualified
as
Mr.
Locke
thinks
he
ought
to
be
,
for
your
Billy
as
he
grows
up
.
<EOS>
Suppose
there
is
danger
from
your
meaner
servants
;
or
we
his
parents
should
not
be
able
to
lay
ourselves
under
the
requisite
restraints
,
in
order
to
form
his
mind
by
our
own
examples
,
which
I
hope
,
by
God
's
grace
,
however
,
will
not
be
the
case
 
<EOS>
Can
not
some
master
be
found
,
who
shall
be
so
well
rewarded
for
his
care
of
a
few
young
gentlemen
,
as
to
make
it
worth
his
while
to
be
contented
with
those
few
?
 
<EOS>
suppose
from
five
to
eight
at
most
;
whose
morals
and
breeding
he
may
attend
to
,
as
well
as
to
their
learning
?
<EOS>
The
farther
this
master
lives
from
the
young
gentleman
's
friends
,
the
better
it
may
be
.
<EOS>
We
will
hope
,
that
he
is
a
man
of
a
mild
disposition
,
but
strict
in
his
discipline
,
and
who
shall
make
it
a
rule
not
to
give
correction
for
small
faults
,
or
till
every
other
method
has
been
tried
;
who
carries
such
a
just
dignity
in
his
manner
,
without
the
appearance
of
tyranny
,
that
his
looks
may
be
of
greater
force
than
the
blows
of
others
;
and
who
will
rather
endeavour
to
shame
than
terrify
,
a
youth
out
of
his
faults
.
<EOS>
Then
,
suppose
this
gentleman
was
to
allot
a
particular
portion
of
time
for
the
more
learned
studies
;
and
before
the
youth
was
tired
with
them
,
suppose
another
portion
was
allotted
for
the
writing
and
arithmetic
;
and
then
to
relieve
his
mind
from
both
,
suppose
the
dancing
-
master
should
take
his
part
;
and
innocent
exercises
of
mere
diversion
,
to
fill
up
the
rest
,
at
his
own
choice
,
in
which
,
diverted
by
such
a
rotation
of
employments
(
all
thus
rendered
delightful
by
their
successive
variety
)
,
he
would
hardly
wish
to
pass
much
time
.
<EOS>
For
the
dancing
of
itself
,
with
the
dancing
-
master
's
instruction
,
if
a
well
-
bred
man
,
will
answer
both
parts
,
that
of
breeding
and
that
of
exercise
:
and
thus
different
studies
at
once
be
mastered
.
  
<EOS>
Moreover
,
the
emulation
which
will
be
inspired
,
where
there
are
several
young
gentlemen
,
will
be
of
inconceivable
use
both
to
tutor
and
pupil
,
in
lessening
the
trouble
of
the
one
,
and
advancing
the
learning
of
the
other
,
which
can
not
be
expected
where
there
is
but
a
single
youth
to
be
taken
care
of
.
  
<EOS>
Such
a
master
will
know
it
to
be
his
interest
,
as
well
as
duty
,
to
have
a
watchful
eye
over
the
conduct
and
behaviour
of
his
servants
.
<EOS>
His
assistants
,
in
the
different
branches
of
science
and
education
,
will
be
persons
of
approved
prudence
,
for
whom
he
will
think
himself
answerable
,
since
his
own
reputation
,
as
well
as
livelihood
,
will
depend
upon
their
behaviour
.
<EOS>
The
youths
will
have
young
gentlemen
for
their
companions
,
all
under
the
influence
of
the
same
precepts
and
directions
;
and
if
some
chosen
period
were
fixed
,
as
a
reward
for
some
excellence
,
where
,
at
a
little
desk
,
raised
a
step
or
two
above
the
other
seats
,
the
excelling
youth
should
be
set
to
read
,
under
the
master
's
direction
,
a
little
portion
from
the
best
translations
of
the
Greek
and
Roman
historians
,
and
even
from
the
best
English
authors
;
this
might
,
in
a
very
engaging
manner
,
initiate
them
into
the
knowledge
of
the
history
of
past
times
,
and
of
their
own
country
,
and
give
them
a
curiosity
to
pass
some
of
their
vacant
hours
in
the
same
laudable
pursuit
:
for
,
<EOS>
dear
Sir
,
I
must
still
insist
that
rewards
,
and
innocent
gratifications
,
as
also
little
honours
and
distinctions
,
must
needs
be
very
attractive
to
the
minds
of
youth
.
  
<EOS>
For
,
is
not
the
pretty
ride
,
and
dairy
house
breakfasting
,
by
which
Miss
Goodwin
's
governess
distinguishes
the
little
ladies
who
excel
in
their
allotted
tasks
,
a
fine
encouragement
to
their
ductile
minds
?
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
it
is
,
to
be
sure
!
 
<EOS>
And
I
have
often
thought
of
it
with
pleasure
,
and
partaken
of
the
delight
with
which
I
have
supposed
<EOS>
their
pretty
hearts
must
be
filled
with
on
that
occasion
.
<EOS>
And
why
may
not
such
little
triumphs
be
,
in
proportion
,
as
incentives
,
to
children
,
to
make
them
try
to
master
laudable
tasks
;
as
the
Roman
triumphs
,
of
different
kinds
,
and
their
mural
and
civic
crowns
,
all
which
I
have
heard
you
speak
of
,
were
to
their
heroes
and
warriors
of
old
?
<EOS>
For
Mr.
Dryden
<EOS>
well
observes
,
that
     
"
Men
are
but
children
of
a
larger
growth
;
  
<EOS>
Our
appetites
are
apt
to
change
as
theirs
,
  
And
full
as
craving
too
,
and
full
as
vain
.
"
    
<EOS>
Permit
me
.
<EOS>
Sir
,
to
transcribe
four
or
five
lines
more
,
for
the
  
beauty
of
the
thought
:
    
"
And
yet
the
soul
,
shut
up
in
her
dark
room
,
  
Viewing
<EOS>
so
clear
abroad
,
at
home
sees
nothing
:
  
<EOS>
But
like
a
mole
in
earth
,
busy
and
blind
,
  
Works
all
her
folly
up
,
and
casts
it
outward
  
<EOS>
To
the
world
's
open
view
"
  
Improving
the
thought
:
methinks
<EOS>
I
can
see
the
dear
little
Miss
,
who
has
,
in
some
eminent
task
,
borne
away
the
palm
,
make
her
public
entry
,
as
I
may
call
it
,
after
her
dairy
breakfast
and
pretty
airing
,
into
the
governess
's
court
-
yard
,
through
a
row
of
her
school
-
fellows
,
drawn
out
on
each
side
to
admire
her
;
her
governess
and
assistants
receiving
her
at
the
porch
,
their
little
capitol
,
and
lifting
her
out
with
applauses
and
encomiums
,
with
a
Thus
shall
it
be
done
to
the
Miss
,
whom
her
governess
delighteth
to
honour
!
<EOS>
I
see
not
why
the
dear
Miss
in
this
case
,
as
she
moves
through
her
admiring
school
-
fellows
,
may
not
have
her
little
heart
beat
with
as
much
delight
,
be
as
gloriously
elated
,
proportionably
,
as
that
of
the
greatest
hero
in
his
triumphal
car
,
who
has
returned
from
exploits
,
perhaps
,
much
less
laudable
.
  
<EOS>
But
how
I
ramble
!
 
<EOS>
Yet
surely
,
Sir
,
you
do
n't
expect
method
or
connection
from
your
girl
.
<EOS>
The
education
of
our
sex
will
not
permit
that
,
where
it
is
best
.
<EOS>
We
are
forced
to
struggle
for
knowledge
,
like
the
poor
feeble
infant
in
the
month
,
who
is
pinned
and
fettered
down
upon
the
nurse
's
lap
;
and
who
,
if
its
little
arms
happen
,
by
chance
,
to
escape
its
nurse
's
observation
,
and
offer
but
to
expand
themselves
,
are
immediately
taken
into
custody
,
and
pinioned
down
to
their
passive
behaviour
.
<EOS>
So
,
when
a
poor
girl
,
in
spite
of
her
narrow
education
,
breaks
out
into
notice
,
her
genius
is
immediately
tamed
by
trifling
employments
,
lest
<EOS>
,
perhaps
,
she
should
become
the
envy
of
one
sex
,
and
the
equal
of
the
other
.
<EOS>
But
you
.
<EOS>
Sir
,
act
more
nobly
with
your
Pamela
;
for
you
throw
in
her
way
all
opportunities
of
improvement
;
and
she
has
only
to
regret
,
that
she
can
not
make
a
better
use
of
them
,
and
,
of
consequence
,
render
herself
more
worthy
of
your
generous
indulgence
.
  
<EOS>
I
know
not
how
,
Sir
,
to
recover
my
thread
;
and
so
must
break
off
with
that
delight
which
I
always
take
when
I
come
near
the
bottom
of
my
letters
to
your
dear
self
;
because
then
I
can
boast
of
the
honour
which
I
have
in
being
your
ever
dutiful
,
  
<EOS>
P.B.
    
Well
,
but
<EOS>
,
my
dear
Mr.
B.
,
you
will
perhaps
think
,
from
my
last
rambling
letter
,
that
I
am
most
inclined
to
a
school
education
for
your
Billy
,
and
some
years
hence
,
if
it
should
please
God
to
spare
him
to
us
.
<EOS>
Yet
I
can
not
say
that
I
am
;
I
only
lay
several
things
together
in
my
usual
indigested
way
,
to
take
your
opinion
upon
,
which
,
as
it
ought
,
will
be
always
decisive
with
me
.
<EOS>
And
indeed
I
am
so
thoroughly
convinced
by
Mr.
Locke
's
reasons
,
where
the
behaviour
of
servants
can
be
so
well
answered
for
,
as
that
of
yours
can
be
,
and
where
the
example
of
the
parents
will
be
,
as
I
hope
,
rather
edifying
than
otherwise
,
that
without
being
swayed
,
as
I
think
,
by
maternal
fondness
,
in
this
case
,
I
must
needs
give
a
preference
to
the
home
education
;
and
the
little
scheme
I
presumed
to
form
in
my
last
,
was
only
on
a
supposition
,
that
those
necessary
points
could
not
be
so
well
secured
.
  
<EOS>
In
my
observations
on
this
head
,
I
shall
take
the
liberty
,
in
one
or
two
particulars
,
a
little
to
differ
from
an
author
,
that
I
admire
exceedingly
;
and
that
is
the
present
design
of
my
writing
these
letters
;
for
I
shall
hereafter
<EOS>
,
if
God
spare
my
life
,
in
my
little
book
(
when
you
have
kindly
decided
upon
the
points
in
which
I
presume
to
differ
)
shew
you
,
Sir
,
my
great
reverence
and
esteem
for
him
;
and
can
then
let
you
know
all
my
sentiments
on
this
important
subject
,
and
that
more
undoubtedly
,
as
I
shall
be
more
improved
by
years
and
your
conversation
;
especially
,
Sir
,
if
I
have
the
honour
and
happiness
of
a
foreign
tour
with
you
,
of
which
you
give
me
hope
;
so
much
are
you
pleased
with
the
delight
I
take
in
these
improving
excursions
,
which
you
have
now
favoured
me
with
,
at
different
times
,
through
more
than
half
the
kingdom
.
  
<EOS>
Well
then
,
Sir
,
I
will
proceed
to
consider
a
little
more
particularly
the
subject
of
a
home
education
,
with
an
eye
to
those
difficulties
,
of
which
Mr.
Locke
takes
notice
,
as
I
mentioned
in
my
last
.
<EOS>
As
to
the
first
,
that
of
finding
a
qualified
tutor
;
we
must
not
expect
so
much
perfection
,
I
doubt
,
as
he
lays
down
as
necessary
.
<EOS>
What
,
therefore
,
I
humbly
conceive
is
best
to
be
done
,
will
be
to
avoid
choosing
a
man
of
bigoted
and
narrow
principles
;
who
yet
shall
not
be
tainted
with
sceptical
or
heterodox
notions
,
nor
a
mere
scholar
or
pedant
;
who
has
travelled
,
and
yet
preserved
his
moral
character
untainted
;
and
whose
behaviour
and
carriage
is
easy
,
unaffected
,
unformal
,
and
genteel
,
as
well
acquiredly
as
naturally
so
,
if
possible
;
who
shall
not
be
dogmatical
,
positive
,
overbearing
,
on
one
hand
;
nor
too
yielding
,
suppliant
,
fawning
,
on
the
other
;
who
shall
study
the
child
's
natural
bent
,
in
order
to
direct
his
studies
to
the
point
he
is
most
likely
to
excel
in
;
and
to
preserve
the
respect
due
to
his
own
character
from
every
one
,
he
must
not
be
a
busy
body
in
the
family
,
a
whisperer
,
a
tale
-
bearer
,
but
of
a
benevolent
turn
of
mind
,
ready
to
compose
differences
;
who
shall
avoid
,
of
all
things
,
that
foppishness
of
dress
and
appearance
,
which
distinguishes
the
petit
-
maitres
,
and
French
ushers
(
that
I
have
seen
at
some
boarding
schools
)
,
for
coxcombs
rather
than
guides
of
education
:
for
,
as
I
have
heard
you
,
my
best
tutor
,
often
observe
,
the
peculiarities
of
habit
,
where
a
person
aims
at
something
fantastic
,
or
out
of
character
,
are
an
undoubted
sign
of
a
wrong
head
;
for
such
a
one
is
so
kind
as
always
to
hang
out
on
his
sign
<EOS>
what
sort
of
furniture
he
has
in
his
shop
,
to
save
you
the
trouble
of
asking
questions
about
him
;
so
that
one
may
as
easily
know
by
his
outward
appearance
what
he
is
,
as
one
can
know
a
widow
by
her
weeds
.
  
<EOS>
Such
a
person
as
I
have
thus
negatively
described
,
may
be
found
without
very
much
difficulty
,
perhaps
,
because
some
of
these
requisites
are
personal
,
and
others
are
such
as
are
obvious
at
first
sight
,
to
a
common
penetration
;
or
,
where
not
so
,
may
be
found
out
,
by
inquiry
into
his
general
character
and
behaviour
:
<EOS>
and
to
the
care
of
such
a
one
,
dear
Sir
,
let
me
suppose
your
Billy
is
committed
:
<EOS>
and
so
we
acquit
ourselves
of
the
first
difficulty
,
as
well
as
we
can
,
that
of
the
tutor
;
who
,
to
become
more
perfect
,
may
form
himself
,
as
to
what
he
wants
,
by
Mr.
Locke
's
excellent
rules
on
that
head
.
  
<EOS>
But
before
I
quit
this
subject
,
I
beg
to
remind
you
of
your
opinion
upon
it
,
in
a
conversation
with
Sir
George
Stuart
,
and
his
nephew
,
in
London
;
in
which
you
seemed
to
prefer
a
Scottish
gentleman
for
a
tutor
,
to
those
of
your
own
nation
,
and
still
more
than
to
those
of
France
?
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
remember
it
,
dear
Sir
?
<EOS>
And
how
much
those
gentlemen
were
pleased
with
your
facetious
freedom
with
their
country
,
and
said
,
you
made
them
amends
for
that
,
in
your
preference
to
their
learned
and
travelled
youth
?
<EOS>
If
you
have
forgot
it
,
I
will
here
transcribe
it
from
my
records
,
as
I
call
my
book
of
memorandums
;
for
every
time
I
am
pleased
with
a
conversation
,
and
have
leisure
,
before
it
quits
my
memory
,
I
enter
it
down
in
as
near
the
very
words
as
I
can
;
and
now
you
have
made
me
your
correspondent
<EOS>
,
I
shall
sometimes
,
perhaps
,
give
you
back
some
valuables
from
your
own
treasure
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Darnford
,
and
Mr.
Turner
,
and
Mr.
Fanshaw
,
were
present
,
I
well
remember
.
<EOS>
These
were
your
words
:
  
"
Since
the
union
of
the
two
kingdoms
,
we
have
many
persons
of
condition
,
who
have
taken
their
tutors
for
their
sons
from
Scotland
;
which
practice
,
to
speak
impartially
,
has
been
attended
with
some
advantageous
circumstances
,
that
should
not
be
overlooked
.
<EOS>
For
,
Sir
George
,
it
must
be
confessed
that
,
notwithstanding
your
narrow
and
stiff
manner
of
education
in
Scotland
,
a
spirit
of
manly
learning
,
a
kind
of
poetic
liberty
,
as
I
may
call
it
,
has
begun
to
exert
itself
in
that
part
of
the
island
.
<EOS>
The
blustering
north
 
forgive
me
,
gentlemen
 
seems
to
have
hardened
the
foreheads
of
her
hungry
sons
;
and
the
keenness
with
which
they
set
out
for
preferment
in
the
kindlier
south
,
has
taught
them
to
know
a
good
deal
of
the
world
betimes
.
<EOS>
Through
the
easy
terms
on
which
learning
is
generally
attained
there
,
as
it
is
earlier
inculcated
,
so
it
may
,
probably
,
take
deeper
root
:
and
since
'
tis
hardly
possible
 
forgive
me
,
dear
Sirs
 
they
can
go
to
a
worse
country
on
this
side
Greenland
,
than
some
of
the
northern
parts
of
Scotland
;
so
their
education
,
with
a
view
to
travel
,
and
to
better
themselves
by
settlements
in
other
countries
,
may
,
perhaps
,
be
so
many
reasons
to
take
greater
pains
to
qualify
themselves
for
this
employment
,
and
may
make
them
succeed
better
in
it
;
especially
when
they
have
been
able
to
shake
off
the
fetters
which
are
rivetted
upon
them
under
the
narrow
influence
of
a
too
tyrannical
kirk
discipline
,
which
you
,
Sir
George
,
have
just
now
so
freely
censured
.
  
<EOS>
"
To
these
considerations
,
when
we
add
the
necessity
,
which
these
remote
tutors
lie
under
,
of
behaving
well
;
first
,
because
they
seldom
wish
to
return
to
their
own
country
;
and
next
,
because
that
can
not
prefer
them
,
if
it
would
;
and
thirdly
,
because
it
would
not
,
if
it
could
,
if
the
gentleman
be
of
an
enlarged
genius
,
and
generous
way
of
thinking
;
I
say
,
when
we
add
to
the
premises
these
considerations
,
they
all
make
a
kind
of
security
for
their
good
behaviour
:
while
those
of
our
own
country
have
often
friends
or
acquaintances
on
whose
favour
they
are
apt
to
depend
,
and
for
that
reason
give
less
attention
to
the
duties
requisite
for
this
important
office
.
  
<EOS>
"
Besides
,
as
their
kind
friend
AEolus
,
who
is
accustomed
to
spread
and
strengthen
the
bold
muscles
of
the
strong
-
featured
Scot
,
has
generally
blown
away
that
inauspicious
bashfulness
,
which
hangs
a
much
longer
time
,
commonly
,
on
the
faces
of
the
southern
students
;
such
a
one
(
if
he
fall
not
too
egregiously
into
the
contrary
extreme
,
so
as
to
become
insufferable
)
may
still
be
the
more
eligible
person
for
a
tutor
,
as
he
may
teach
a
young
gentleman
,
betimes
,
that
necessary
presence
of
mind
,
which
those
who
are
confined
to
a
private
education
sometimes
want
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
after
all
,
if
a
gentleman
of
this
nation
be
chosen
for
this
employment
,
it
may
be
necessary
that
he
should
be
one
who
has
had
as
genteel
and
free
an
education
himself
,
as
his
country
will
afford
;
and
the
native
roughness
of
his
climate
filed
off
by
travel
and
conversation
;
who
has
made
,
at
least
,
the
tour
of
France
and
Italy
,
and
has
a
taste
for
the
politeness
of
the
former
nation
:
but
from
the
boisterousness
of
a
North
Britain
,
and
the
fantastic
politeness
of
a
Frenchman
,
if
happily
blended
,
such
a
mixture
may
result
,
as
will
furnish
out
a
more
complete
tutor
,
than
either
of
the
two
nations
,
singly
,
may
be
able
to
produce
.
<EOS>
But
it
ought
to
be
remembered
that
this
person
must
have
conquered
his
native
brogue
,
as
I
may
call
it
,
and
be
a
master
of
the
English
pronunciation
;
otherwise
his
conversation
will
be
disagreeable
to
an
English
ear
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
permit
me
to
add
,
that
,
as
an
acquaintance
with
the
Muses
contributes
not
a
little
to
soften
the
manners
,
and
give
a
graceful
and
delicate
turn
to
the
imagination
,
and
a
kind
of
polish
to
severer
studies
,
it
would
not
be
amiss
that
he
should
have
a
taste
of
poetry
,
although
perhaps
it
were
not
to
be
wished
he
had
such
strong
inclinations
that
way
,
as
to
make
that
lively
and
delectable
amusement
his
predominant
passion
:
for
we
see
very
few
poets
,
whose
warm
imaginations
do
not
run
away
with
their
judgments
.
<EOS>
And
yet
,
in
order
to
learn
the
dead
languages
in
their
purity
,
it
will
be
necessary
to
inculcate
both
the
love
and
the
study
of
the
ancient
poets
,
which
can
not
fail
of
giving
the
youth
a
taste
for
poetry
,
in
general
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Permit
me
,
dear
Sir
,
to
ask
you
,
whether
you
advanced
this
for
argument
sake
,
as
sometimes
you
love
to
amuse
and
entertain
your
friends
in
an
uncommon
way
?
<EOS>
For
I
should
imagine
,
that
our
two
universities
,
which
you
have
shewn
me
,
and
for
which
I
have
ever
since
had
a
greater
reverence
than
I
had
before
,
are
capable
of
furnishing
as
good
tutors
as
any
nation
in
the
world
:
for
here
the
young
gentlemen
seem
to
me
to
live
both
in
the
world
and
in
the
university
;
and
we
saw
several
gentlemen
who
had
not
only
fine
parts
,
but
polite
behaviour
,
and
deep
learning
,
as
you
assured
me
;
some
of
whom
you
entertained
,
and
were
entertained
by
,
in
so
elegant
a
manner
,
that
no
travelled
gentleman
,
if
I
may
be
allowed
to
judge
,
could
excel
them
!
<EOS>
And
besides
,
my
dear
Mr.
B.
,
I
know
who
is
reckoned
one
of
the
politest
and
best
-
bred
gentlemen
in
England
by
every
body
,
and
learned
as
well
as
polite
,
and
yet
had
his
education
in
one
of
those
celebrated
seats
of
learning
.
<EOS>
I
wish
your
Billy
may
never
fall
short
of
the
gentleman
I
mean
,
in
all
these
acquirements
;
and
he
will
be
a
very
happy
creature
,
I
am
sure
.
  
<EOS>
But
how
I
wander
again
from
my
subject
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
other
way
to
recover
myself
,
when
I
thus
ramble
,
but
by
returning
to
that
one
delightful
point
of
reflection
,
that
I
have
the
honour
to
be
,
dearest
Sir
,
<EOS>
your
ever
dutiful
and
obliged
,
  
<EOS>
P.B.
    
DEAREST
SIR
,
  
<EOS>
I
now
resume
my
subject
.
<EOS>
I
had
gone
through
the
article
of
the
tutor
,
as
well
as
I
could
;
and
will
now
observe
upon
what
Mr.
Locke
says
,
That
children
are
wholly
,
if
possible
,
to
be
kept
from
the
conversation
of
the
meaner
servants
;
whom
he
supposes
to
be
,
as
too
frequently
they
are
,
unbred
and
debauched
,
to
use
his
own
words
.
  
<EOS>
Now
,
Sir
,
I
think
it
is
very
difficult
to
keep
children
from
the
conversation
of
servants
at
all
times
.
<EOS>
The
care
of
personal
attendance
,
especially
in
the
child
's
early
age
,
must
fall
upon
servants
of
one
denomination
or
other
,
who
,
little
or
much
,
must
be
conversant
with
the
inferior
servants
,
and
so
be
liable
to
be
tainted
by
their
conversation
;
and
it
will
be
difficult
in
this
case
to
prevent
the
taint
being
communicated
to
the
child
.
<EOS>
Wherefore
it
will
be
a
surer
,
as
well
as
a
more
laudable
method
,
to
insist
upon
the
regular
behaviour
of
the
whole
family
,
than
to
expect
the
child
,
and
its
immediate
attendant
or
tutor
,
should
be
the
only
good
ones
in
it
.
  
<EOS>
Nor
is
this
so
difficult
to
effect
,
as
may
be
imagined
.
<EOS>
Your
family
affords
an
eminent
instance
of
it
:
the
good
have
been
confirmed
,
the
remiss
have
been
reformed
,
the
passionate
have
been
tamed
;
and
there
is
not
a
family
in
the
kingdom
,
I
will
venture
to
say
,
to
the
honour
of
every
individual
in
it
,
more
uniform
,
more
regular
,
and
freer
from
evil
,
and
more
regardful
of
what
they
say
and
do
,
than
yours
.
<EOS>
And
you
will
allow
,
that
though
always
honest
,
yet
they
were
not
always
so
laudable
,
so
exemplarily
virtuous
,
as
of
late
:
which
I
mention
only
to
shew
the
practicableness
of
a
reformation
,
even
where
bad
habits
have
taken
place
 
For
your
Pamela
,
Sir
,
arrogates
not
to
herself
the
honour
of
this
change
:
'
tis
owing
to
the
Divine
grace
shining
upon
hearts
naturally
good
;
for
else
an
example
so
easy
,
so
plain
,
so
simple
,
from
so
young
a
mistress
,
who
moreover
had
been
exalted
from
their
own
station
,
could
not
have
been
attended
with
such
happy
effects
.
  
<EOS>
You
see
,
dear
Sir
,
what
a
master
and
mistress
's
example
could
do
,
with
a
poor
soul
so
far
gone
as
Mrs.
Jewkes
.
<EOS>
And
I
dare
be
confident
,
that
if
,
on
the
hiring
of
a
new
servant
,
sobriety
of
manners
and
a
virtuous
conversation
were
insisted
upon
,
and
a
general
inoffensiveness
in
words
as
well
as
actions
was
required
from
them
,
as
indispensable
conditions
of
their
service
:
and
that
a
breach
of
that
kind
would
be
no
more
passed
over
,
than
a
wilful
fraud
,
or
an
act
of
dishonesty
;
and
if
,
added
to
these
requisites
,
their
principals
take
care
to
support
these
injunctions
by
their
own
example
;
I
say
,
then
,
I
dare
be
confident
,
that
if
such
a
service
did
not
find
them
good
,
it
would
make
them
so
.
  
<EOS>
And
why
should
we
not
think
this
a
very
practicable
scheme
,
considering
the
servants
we
take
are
at
years
of
discretion
,
and
have
the
strong
ties
of
interest
superadded
to
the
obligations
we
require
of
them
?
<EOS>
and
which
,
they
must
needs
know
<EOS>
(
let
'em
have
what
bad
habits
they
will
)
are
right
for
themselves
to
discharge
,
as
well
as
for
us
to
exact
.
  
<EOS>
We
all
know
of
how
much
force
the
example
of
superiors
is
to
inferiors
.
<EOS>
It
is
too
justly
said
,
that
the
courts
of
princes
abound
with
the
most
profligate
of
men
,
<EOS>
insomuch
that
a
man
can
not
well
have
a
more
significantly
bad
title
,
than
that
of
COURTIER
:
yet
even
among
these
<EOS>
,
one
shall
see
the
force
of
example
,
as
I
have
heard
you
,
Sir
,
frequently
observe
:
for
,
let
but
<EOS>
the
land
be
blest
with
a
pious
and
religious
prince
,
who
makes
it
a
rule
with
him
to
countenance
and
promote
men
of
virtue
and
probity
;
and
to
put
the
case
still
stronger
,
let
such
a
one
even
succeed
to
the
most
libertine
reign
,
wherein
the
manners
of
the
people
are
wholly
depraved
:
yet
a
wonderful
change
will
be
immediately
effected
.
<EOS>
The
flagitious
livers
will
be
chased
away
,
or
reformed
;
or
at
least
will
think
it
their
duty
,
or
their
interest
,
which
is
a
stronger
tie
with
such
,
to
appear
reformed
;
and
not
a
man
will
seek
for
the
favour
or
countenance
of
his
prince
,
but
by
laudable
pretences
,
or
by
worthy
actions
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
reign
of
King
Richard
III
,
as
I
have
read
,
deformity
of
body
was
the
fashion
,
and
the
nobility
and
gentry
of
the
court
thought
it
an
indispensable
requisite
of
a
graceful
form
to
pad
for
themselves
a
round
shoulder
,
because
the
king
was
crooked
.
<EOS>
And
can
we
think
human
nature
so
absurdly
wicked
,
that
it
would
not
much
rather
have
tried
to
imitate
a
personal
perfection
,
than
a
deformity
so
shocking
in
its
appearance
,
in
people
who
were
naturally
straight
?
  
<EOS>
@@@Tis
melancholy
to
reflect
,
that
of
all
professions
of
men
,
the
mariners
,
who
most
behold
the
wonders
of
Almighty
power
displayed
in
the
great
deep
(
a
sight
that
has
struck
me
with
awe
and
reverence
only
from
a
coast
prospect
)
,
and
<EOS>
who
every
moment
,
while
at
sea
,
have
but
one
frail
plank
betwixt
themselves
and
inevitable
destruction
,
are
yet
,
generally
speaking
,
said
to
be
the
most
abandoned
invokers
and
blasphemers
of
the
name
of
that
God
,
whose
mercies
they
every
moment
unthankfully
,
although
so
visibly
,
experience
.
<EOS>
Yet
,
as
I
once
heard
at
your
table
,
Sir
,
on
a
particular
occasion
,
we
have
now
a
commander
in
the
British
navy
,
who
,
to
his
honour
,
has
shewn
the
force
of
an
excellent
example
supporting
the
best
precepts
:
<EOS>
for
,
on
board
of
his
ship
,
not
an
oath
or
curse
was
to
be
heard
;
while
volleys
of
both
(
issued
from
impious
mouths
in
the
same
squadron
,
out
of
his
knowledge
)
seemed
to
fill
the
sails
of
other
ships
with
guilty
breath
,
calling
aloud
for
that
perdition
to
overtake
them
,
which
perhaps
his
worthy
injunctions
and
example
,
in
his
own
,
might
be
of
weight
to
suspend
.
  
<EOS>
If
such
then
,
dear
Sir
,
be
the
force
of
a
good
example
,
what
have
parents
to
do
,
who
would
bring
up
a
child
at
home
under
their
own
eye
,
according
to
Mr.
Locke
's
advice
,
but
,
first
,
to
have
a
strict
regard
to
their
conduct
!
<EOS>
This
will
not
want
its
due
influence
on
the
servants
;
especially
if
a
proper
enquiry
be
first
made
into
their
characters
,
and
a
watchful
eye
had
over
them
,
to
keep
them
up
to
those
characters
afterwards
.
<EOS>
And
when
they
know
they
must
forfeit
the
favour
of
a
worthy
master
,
and
their
places
too
(
which
may
be
thought
to
be
the
best
of
places
,
because
an
uniform
character
must
make
all
around
it
easy
and
happy
)
,
they
will
readily
observe
such
rules
and
directions
,
as
shall
be
prescribed
to
them
 
Rules
and
directions
,
which
their
own
consciences
will
tell
them
are
right
to
be
prescribed
;
and
even
right
for
them
to
follow
,
were
they
not
insisted
upon
by
their
superiors
:
and
this
conviction
must
go
a
great
way
towards
their
thorough
reformation
:
for
a
person
wholly
convinced
is
half
reformed
.
<EOS>
And
thus
the
hazard
a
child
will
run
of
being
corrupted
by
conversing
with
the
servants
,
will
be
removed
,
and
all
Mr.
Locke
's
other
rules
be
better
enforced
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
the
boldness
,
Sir
,
to
make
another
objection
;
and
that
is
,
to
the
distance
which
Mr.
Locke
prescribes
to
be
kept
between
children
and
servants
:
for
may
not
this
be
a
means
to
fill
the
minds
of
the
former
with
a
contempt
of
those
below
them
,
and
an
arrogance
that
is
not
warranted
by
any
rank
or
condition
,
to
their
inferiors
of
the
same
species
?
  
<EOS>
I
have
before
transcribed
what
Mr.
Locke
has
enjoined
in
relation
to
this
distance
,
where
he
says
,
that
the
children
are
by
all
means
to
be
kept
wholly
from
the
conversation
of
the
meaner
servants
.
<EOS>
But
how
much
better
advice
does
the
same
author
give
for
the
behaviour
of
children
to
servants
in
the
following
words
which
,
I
humbly
think
,
are
not
so
entirely
consistent
with
the
former
,
as
might
be
expected
from
so
admirable
an
author
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Another
way
,
"
says
he
(
Section
111
)
,
"
to
instil
sentiments
of
humanity
,
and
to
keep
them
lively
in
young
folks
,
will
be
,
to
accustom
them
to
civility
in
their
language
and
deportment
towards
their
inferiors
,
and
meaner
sort
of
people
,
particularly
servants
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
unusual
to
observe
the
children
in
gentlemen
's
families
treat
the
servants
of
the
house
with
domineering
words
,
names
of
contempt
,
and
an
imperious
carriage
,
as
if
they
were
of
another
race
,
or
species
beneath
them
.
<EOS>
Whether
ill
example
,
the
advantage
of
fortune
or
their
natural
vanity
,
inspire
this
haughtiness
,
it
should
be
prevented
or
weeded
out
;
and
a
gentle
,
courteous
,
affable
carriage
towards
the
lower
ranks
of
men
placed
in
the
room
of
it
.
<EOS>
No
part
of
their
superiority
will
be
hereby
lost
,
but
the
distinction
increased
,
and
their
authority
strengthened
,
when
love
in
inferiors
is
joined
to
outward
respect
,
and
the
esteem
of
the
person
has
a
share
in
their
submission
:
and
domestics
will
pay
a
more
ready
and
cheerful
service
,
when
they
find
themselves
not
spurned
,
because
fortune
has
laid
them
below
the
level
of
others
at
their
master
's
feet
.
"
  
<EOS>
These
,
dear
Sir
,
are
certainly
the
sentiments
of
a
generous
and
enlarged
spirit
:
but
I
hope
,
I
may
observe
,
that
the
great
distance
Mr.
Locke
before
enjoins
to
be
kept
between
children
and
servants
,
is
not
very
consistent
with
the
above
-
cited
paragraph
:
for
if
we
would
prevent
this
undue
contempt
of
inferiors
in
the
temper
of
children
,
the
best
way
,
as
I
humbly
presume
to
think
,
is
not
to
make
it
so
unpardonable
a
fault
for
them
,
especially
in
their
early
years
,
to
be
in
their
company
.
<EOS>
For
can
one
make
the
children
shun
the
servants
without
rendering
them
odious
or
contemptible
to
them
,
and
representing
them
to
the
child
in
such
disadvantageous
light
,
as
must
needs
make
the
servants
vile
in
their
eyes
,
and
themselves
lofty
and
exalted
in
their
own
?
<EOS>
and
thereby
cause
them
to
treat
them
with
"
domineering
words
,
and
an
imperious
carriage
,
as
if
they
were
of
another
race
or
species
beneath
them
;
and
<EOS>
so
,
"
as
Mr.
Locke
says
,
"
nurse
up
their
natural
pride
into
an
habitual
contempt
of
those
beneath
them
;
and
then
,
"
as
he
adds
,
"
where
will
that
probably
end
,
but
in
oppression
and
cruelty
?
"
<EOS>
But
this
matter
,
dear
Sir
,
I
presume
to
think
,
will
all
be
happily
accommodated
and
reconciled
,
when
the
servants
'
good
behaviour
is
secured
by
the
example
and
injunctions
of
the
principals
.
  
<EOS>
Upon
the
whole
,
then
,
of
what
Mr.
Locke
has
enjoined
,
and
what
I
have
taken
the
liberty
to
suggest
on
this
head
,
it
shall
be
my
endeavour
,
in
that
early
part
of
your
dear
Billy
's
education
,
which
you
will
intrust
to
me
,
to
inculcate
betimes
in
his
mind
the
principles
of
universal
benevolence
and
kindness
to
others
,
especially
to
inferiors
.
  
<EOS>
Nor
shall
I
fear
,
that
the
little
dear
will
be
wanting
to
himself
in
assuming
,
as
he
grows
up
,
an
air
of
superiority
and
distance
of
behaviour
equal
to
his
condition
,
or
that
he
will
descend
too
low
for
his
station
.
<EOS>
For
,
Sir
,
there
is
a
pride
and
self
-
love
natural
to
human
minds
,
that
will
seldom
be
kept
so
low
,
as
to
make
them
humbler
than
they
ought
to
be
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
observed
,
before
now
,
instances
of
this
,
in
some
of
the
families
we
visit
,
between
the
young
Masters
or
Misses
,
and
those
children
of
lower
degree
,
who
have
been
brought
to
play
with
them
,
or
divert
them
.
<EOS>
On
the
Masters
'
and
Misses
'
side
<EOS>
I
have
always
seen
,
they
lead
the
play
and
prescribe
the
laws
of
it
,
be
the
diversion
what
it
will
;
while
,
on
the
other
hand
,
their
lower
-
rank
play
-
fellows
have
generally
given
into
their
little
humours
,
though
ever
so
contrary
to
their
own
;
and
the
difference
of
dress
and
appearance
,
and
the
notion
they
have
of
the
more
eminent
condition
of
their
play
-
fellows
'
parents
,
have
begot
in
them
a
kind
of
awe
and
respect
,
that
perhaps
more
than
sufficiently
secures
the
superiority
of
the
one
,
and
the
subordination
of
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
The
advantage
of
this
universal
benevolence
to
a
young
gentleman
,
as
he
grows
up
,
will
be
,
as
I
humbly
conceive
,
so
to
diffuse
itself
over
his
mind
,
as
to
influence
all
his
actions
,
and
give
a
grace
to
every
thing
he
does
or
says
,
and
make
him
admired
and
respected
from
the
best
and
most
durable
motives
;
and
will
be
of
greater
advantage
to
him
for
his
attaining
a
handsome
address
and
behaviour
(
for
it
will
make
him
conscious
that
he
merits
the
distinction
he
will
meet
with
,
and
encourage
him
still
more
to
merit
it
)
,
than
the
best
rules
that
can
be
given
him
for
that
purpose
.
  
<EOS>
I
will
therefore
teach
the
little
dear
courteousness
and
affability
,
from
the
properest
motives
I
am
able
to
think
of
;
and
will
instruct
him
in
only
one
piece
of
pride
,
that
of
being
above
doing
a
mean
or
low
action
.
<EOS>
I
will
caution
him
not
to
behave
in
a
lordly
or
insolent
manner
,
even
to
the
lowest
servants
.
<EOS>
I
will
tell
him
that
that
superiority
is
the
most
commendable
,
and
will
be
the
best
maintained
,
which
is
owing
to
humanity
and
kindness
,
and
grounded
on
the
perfections
of
the
mind
,
rather
than
on
the
accidental
advantage
of
fortune
and
condition
:
that
if
his
conduct
be
such
as
it
ought
to
be
,
there
will
be
no
occasion
to
tell
a
servant
,
that
he
will
be
observed
and
respected
:
that
humility
,
as
I
once
told
my
Miss
Goodwin
,
is
a
charming
grace
,
and
most
conspicuously
charming
in
persons
of
distinction
;
for
that
the
poor
,
who
are
humbled
by
their
condition
,
can
not
glory
in
it
,
as
the
rich
may
;
and
that
it
makes
the
lower
ranks
of
people
love
and
admire
the
high
-
born
,
who
can
so
condescend
:
whereas
pride
,
in
such
,
is
meanness
and
insult
,
as
it
owes
its
boast
and
its
being
to
accidental
advantages
;
which
,
at
the
same
time
,
are
seldom
of
his
procuring
,
who
can
be
so
mean
as
to
be
proud
:
that
even
I
would
sooner
forget
pride
in
a
low
degree
than
in
a
high
;
for
it
may
be
a
security
in
the
first
against
doing
a
base
thing
:
<EOS>
but
in
the
rich
,
it
is
a
base
thing
itself
,
and
an
impolitic
one
too
;
for
the
more
distinction
a
proud
mind
grasps
at
,
the
less
it
will
have
;
and
every
poor
despised
person
can
whisper
such
a
one
in
the
ear
,
when
surrounded
with
,
and
adorned
by
,
all
his
glittering
splendours
,
that
he
was
born
,
and
must
die
,
in
the
same
manner
with
those
whom
he
despises
.
  
<EOS>
Thus
will
the
doctrine
of
benevolence
and
affability
,
implanted
early
in
the
mind
of
a
young
gentleman
,
and
duly
cultivated
as
he
grows
up
,
inspire
him
with
the
requisite
conduct
to
command
respect
from
proper
motives
;
and
while
it
will
make
the
servants
observe
a
decorum
towards
him
,
it
will
oblige
them
to
have
a
guard
upon
their
words
and
actions
in
presence
of
one
,
whose
manner
of
education
and
training
-
up
would
be
so
great
a
reproach
to
them
,
if
they
were
grossly
faulty
:
so
thus
,
I
conceive
,
<EOS>
a
mutual
benefit
will
flow
to
the
manners
of
each
;
and
his
good
behaviour
will
render
him
,
in
some
measure
,
an
instructive
monitor
to
the
whole
family
.
  
<EOS>
But
permit
me
,
Sir
,
to
enlarge
on
the
hint
I
have
already
given
,
in
relation
to
the
example
of
parents
,
in
case
a
preference
be
given
to
the
home
education
.
<EOS>
For
if
this
point
can
not
be
secured
,
I
should
always
imagine
it
were
best
to
put
the
child
to
such
a
school
,
as
I
formerly
mentioned
.
<EOS>
But
yet
the
subject
might
be
spared
by
me
in
this
case
,
as
I
write
with
a
view
only
to
your
family
;
though
you
will
remember
,
that
while
I
follow
Mr.
Locke
,
whose
work
is
public
,
I
must
be
considered
as
directing
myself
to
the
generality
of
the
world
:
for
,
Sir
,
I
have
the
pleasure
to
say
,
that
your
conduct
in
your
family
is
unexceptionable
;
and
the
pride
to
think
that
mine
is
no
disgrace
to
it
.
<EOS>
No
one
hears
a
word
from
your
mouth
unbecoming
the
character
of
a
polite
gentleman
;
and
I
shall
always
be
very
regardful
of
what
falls
from
mine
.
<EOS>
Your
temper
,
Sir
,
is
equal
and
kind
to
all
your
servants
,
and
they
love
you
,
as
well
as
awfully
respect
you
:
and
well
does
your
beautiful
and
considerate
mind
,
deserve
it
of
them
all
:
and
<EOS>
they
,
seeing
I
am
watchful
over
my
own
conduct
,
so
as
not
to
behave
unworthy
of
your
kind
example
,
regard
me
as
much
as
I
could
wish
they
should
;
for
well
do
they
know
,
that
their
beloved
master
will
have
it
so
,
and
greatly
honours
and
esteems
me
himself
.
<EOS>
Your
table
-
talk
is
such
as
persons
of
the
strictest
principles
may
hear
,
and
join
in
:
your
guests
,
and
your
friends
are
,
generally
speaking
,
persons
of
the
genteelest
life
,
and
of
the
best
manners
.
<EOS>
So
that
Mr.
Locke
would
have
advised
you
,
of
all
gentlemen
,
had
he
been
living
,
and
known
you
,
to
give
your
children
a
home
education
,
and
assign
these
,
and
still
stronger
reasons
for
it
.
  
<EOS>
But
were
we
to
speak
to
the
generality
of
parents
<EOS>
,
I
fear
this
would
be
an
almost
insuperable
objection
to
a
home
education
.
<EOS>
For
(
I
am
sorry
to
say
it
)
<EOS>
when
one
turns
one
's
eyes
to
the
bad
precedents
given
by
the
heads
of
some
families
,
it
is
hardly
to
be
wondered
at
,
that
there
is
so
little
virtue
and
religion
among
men
.
<EOS>
For
can
those
parents
be
surprised
at
the
ungraciousness
of
their
children
,
who
hardly
ever
shew
them
,
that
their
own
actions
are
governed
by
reasonable
or
moral
motives
?
<EOS>
Can
the
gluttonous
father
expect
a
self
-
denying
son
?
<EOS>
With
how
ill
a
grace
must
a
man
who
will
often
be
disguised
in
liquor
,
preach
sobriety
?
<EOS>
a
passionate
man
,
patience
?
<EOS>
an
irreligious
man
,
piety
?
<EOS>
How
will
a
parent
,
whose
hands
are
seldom
without
cards
,
or
dice
in
them
,
be
observed
in
lessons
against
the
pernicious
vice
of
gaming
?
<EOS>
Can
the
profuse
father
,
who
is
squandering
away
the
fortunes
of
his
children
,
expect
to
be
regarded
in
a
lesson
of
frugality
?
'
<EOS>
Tis
impossible
he
should
,
except
it
were
that
the
youth
,
seeing
how
pernicious
his
father
's
example
is
,
should
have
the
grace
to
make
a
proper
use
of
it
,
and
look
upon
it
as
a
sea
-
mark
,
as
it
were
,
to
enable
him
to
shun
the
dangerous
rocks
,
on
which
he
sees
his
father
splitting
.
<EOS>
And
even
in
this
best
case
,
let
it
be
considered
,
how
much
shame
and
disgrace
his
thoughtless
parent
ought
to
take
to
himself
,
who
can
admonish
his
child
by
nothing
but
the
odiousness
of
his
own
vice
;
and
how
little
it
is
owing
to
him
,
that
his
guilt
is
not
doubled
,
by
his
son
's
treading
in
his
steps
!
<EOS>
Let
such
an
unhappy
parent
duly
weigh
this
,
and
think
how
likely
he
is
to
be
,
by
his
bad
example
,
the
cause
of
his
child
's
perdition
,
as
well
as
his
own
,
and
stand
unshocked
and
unamended
,
if
he
can
!
  
<EOS>
It
is
then
of
no
avail
to
wish
for
discreet
servants
,
if
the
conduct
of
the
parents
is
faulty
.
<EOS>
If
the
fountain
-
head
be
polluted
,
how
shall
the
under
-
currents
run
clear
?
<EOS>
That
master
and
mistress
,
who
would
exact
from
their
servants
a
behaviour
which
they
themselves
do
n't
practice
,
will
be
but
ill
observed
.
<EOS>
And
that
child
,
who
discovers
excesses
and
errors
in
his
parents
,
will
be
found
to
be
less
profited
by
their
good
precepts
,
than
prejudiced
by
bad
examples
.
<EOS>
Excessive
fondness
this
hour
;
violent
passions
and
perhaps
execrations
,
the
next
;
unguarded
jests
,
and
admiration
of
fashionable
vanities
,
rash
censures
,
are
perhaps
the
best
,
that
the
child
sees
in
,
or
hears
from
those
,
who
are
most
concerned
to
inculcate
good
precepts
into
his
mind
.
<EOS>
And
where
it
is
so
,
a
home
education
must
not
surely
be
chosen
.
  
<EOS>
Having
thus
,
as
well
as
my
slender
abilities
will
permit
,
presumed
to
deliver
my
opinion
upon
three
great
points
,
viz
.
<EOS>
the
qualifications
of
a
tutor
;
the
necessity
of
having
an
eye
to
the
morals
of
servants
;
and
the
example
of
parents
(
all
which
,
being
taken
care
of
,
will
give
a
preference
,
as
I
imagine
,
to
a
home
education
)
;
permit
me
,
dear
Sir
,
to
speak
a
little
further
to
a
point
,
that
I
have
already
touched
upon
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
that
of
emulation
;
which
I
humbly
conceive
to
be
of
great
efficacy
to
lead
children
on
in
their
duties
and
studies
.
<EOS>
And
how
,
dear
Sir
,
shall
this
advantage
be
procured
for
a
young
master
,
who
has
no
school
-
fellows
and
who
has
no
example
to
follow
,
but
that
of
his
tutor
,
whom
he
can
not
,
from
the
disparity
of
years
,
and
other
circumstances
,
without
pain
(
because
of
this
disparity
)
,
think
of
emulating
?
<EOS>
And
this
,
I
conceive
,
is
a
very
great
advantage
to
such
a
school
education
,
as
I
mentioned
in
my
former
letter
,
where
there
are
no
more
scholars
taken
in
,
than
the
master
can
with
ease
and
pleasure
instruct
.
  
<EOS>
But
one
way
,
in
my
humble
opinion
,
is
left
to
answer
this
objection
,
and
still
preserve
the
reason
for
the
preference
which
Mr.
Locke
gives
to
a
home
education
;
and
that
is
,
what
I
formerly
hinted
,
to
take
into
your
family
the
child
of
some
honest
neighbour
of
but
middling
circumstances
,
and
like
age
of
your
own
,
but
who
should
give
apparent
indications
of
his
natural
promptitude
,
ingenuous
temper
,
obliging
behaviour
and
good
manners
;
and
to
let
him
go
hand
-
in
-
hand
with
yours
in
his
several
studies
and
lessons
under
the
same
tutor
.
  
<EOS>
The
child
would
be
sensible
of
the
benefit
,
as
well
as
of
the
distinction
,
he
received
,
and
consequently
of
what
was
expected
from
him
,
and
would
double
his
diligence
,
and
exert
all
his
good
qualities
,
which
would
inspire
the
young
gentleman
with
the
wished
-
for
emulation
,
and
,
as
I
imagine
,
would
be
so
promotive
of
his
learning
,
that
it
would
greatly
compensate
the
tutor
for
his
pains
with
the
additional
scholar
;
for
the
young
gentleman
would
be
ashamed
to
be
outdone
by
one
of
like
years
and
stature
with
himself
.
<EOS>
And
little
rewards
might
be
proposed
to
the
greatest
proficient
,
in
order
to
heighten
the
emulation
.
  
<EOS>
Then
,
Sir
,
the
generosity
of
such
a
method
,
to
a
gentleman
of
your
fortune
,
and
beneficent
mind
,
would
be
its
own
reward
,
were
there
no
other
benefit
to
be
received
from
it
.
  
<EOS>
Moreover
,
such
an
ingenious
youth
might
,
by
his
good
morals
and
industry
,
hereafter
be
of
service
,
in
some
place
of
trust
in
the
family
;
or
it
would
be
easy
for
a
gentleman
of
your
interest
in
the
world
,
if
such
a
thing
offered
not
,
to
provide
for
the
youth
in
the
navy
,
in
some
of
the
public
offices
,
or
among
your
private
friends
.
<EOS>
If
he
proved
faulty
in
his
morals
,
his
dismission
would
be
in
your
own
power
,
and
would
be
punishment
enough
.
  
<EOS>
But
,
if
on
the
other
hand
,
he
proved
a
sober
and
hopeful
youth
,
he
would
make
an
excellent
companion
for
your
Billy
in
riper
years
;
as
he
would
be
,
in
a
manner
,
a
corroborator
of
his
morals
;
for
,
as
his
circumstances
would
not
support
him
in
any
extravagance
,
so
they
would
be
a
check
upon
his
inclination
;
and
this
being
seconded
by
the
hopes
of
future
preferment
from
your
favour
and
interest
,
which
he
could
not
expect
but
upon
the
terms
of
his
perseverance
in
virtue
,
he
would
find
himself
under
a
necessity
of
setting
such
an
example
,
as
might
be
of
great
benefit
to
his
companion
,
who
should
be
watched
,
as
he
grew
up
,
that
he
did
not
(
if
his
ample
fortune
became
dangerous
to
his
virtue
)
contribute
out
of
his
affluence
to
draw
the
other
after
him
into
extravagance
.
<EOS>
And
to
this
end
,
as
I
humbly
conceive
,
the
noble
doctrine
of
independence
should
be
early
instilled
into
both
their
minds
,
and
upon
all
occasions
,
inculcated
and
inforced
;
which
would
be
an
inducement
for
the
one
to
endeavour
to
improve
his
fortune
by
his
honest
industry
,
lest
he
never
be
enabled
to
rise
out
of
a
state
of
dependence
;
and
to
the
other
,
to
keep
,
if
not
to
improve
,
his
own
,
lest
he
ever
fall
into
such
a
servile
state
,
and
thereby
lose
the
glorious
power
of
conferring
happiness
on
the
deserving
,
one
of
the
highest
pleasures
that
a
generous
mind
can
know
;
a
pleasure
,
Sir
,
which
you
have
oftener
experienced
than
thousands
of
gentlemen
:
and
which
may
you
still
continue
to
experience
for
a
long
and
happy
succession
of
years
,
is
the
prayer
of
one
,
the
most
obliged
of
all
others
in
her
own
person
,
as
well
as
in
the
persons
of
her
dearest
relations
,
and
who
owes
to
this
glorious
beneficence
the
honour
she
boasts
,
of
being
your
ever
affectionate
and
grateful
P.B.
    
<EOS>
But
now
,
my
dear
Mr.
B.
,
if
you
will
indulge
me
in
a
letter
or
two
more
,
preparative
to
my
little
book
,
I
will
take
the
liberty
to
touch
upon
one
or
two
other
places
<EOS>
,
wherein
I
differ
from
this
learned
gentleman
.
<EOS>
But
first
,
permit
me
to
observe
,
that
if
parents
are
,
above
all
things
,
to
avoid
giving
bad
examples
to
their
children
,
they
will
be
no
less
careful
to
shun
the
practice
of
such
fond
fathers
and
mothers
,
as
are
wo
nt
to
indulge
their
children
in
bad
habits
,
and
give
them
their
head
,
at
a
time
when
,
like
wax
,
their
tender
minds
may
be
moulded
into
what
shape
they
please
.
<EOS>
This
is
a
point
that
,
if
it
please
God
,
I
will
carefully
attend
to
,
because
it
is
the
foundation
on
which
the
superstructure
of
the
whole
future
man
is
to
be
erected
.
<EOS>
For
,
according
as
he
is
indulged
or
checked
in
his
childish
follies
,
a
ground
is
laid
for
his
future
happiness
or
misery
;
and
if
once
they
are
suffered
to
become
habitual
to
him
,
it
can
not
but
be
expected
,
that
they
will
grow
up
with
him
,
and
that
they
will
hardly
ever
be
eradicated
.
<EOS>
"
Try
it
,
"
says
Mr.
Locke
,
speaking
to
this
very
point
,
"
in
a
dog
,
or
a
horse
,
or
any
other
creature
,
and
see
whether
the
ill
and
resty
tricks
they
have
learned
when
young
,
are
easily
to
be
mended
,
when
they
are
knit
;
and
yet
none
of
these
creatures
are
half
so
wilful
and
proud
,
or
half
so
desirous
to
be
masters
of
themselves
,
as
men
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
this
brings
me
,
dear
Sir
,
to
the
head
of
punishments
,
in
which
,
as
well
as
in
the
article
of
rewards
,
which
I
have
touched
upon
,
I
have
a
little
objection
to
what
Mr.
Locke
advances
.
  
<EOS>
But
permit
me
,
however
,
to
premise
,
that
I
am
exceedingly
pleased
with
the
method
laid
down
by
this
excellent
writer
,
rather
to
shame
the
child
out
of
his
fault
,
than
beat
him
;
which
latter
serves
generally
for
nothing
but
to
harden
his
mind
.
  
<EOS>
Obstinacy
,
and
telling
a
lie
,
and
committing
a
wilful
fault
,
and
then
persisting
in
it
,
are
,
I
agree
with
this
gentleman
,
the
only
causes
for
which
the
child
should
be
punished
with
stripes
:
<EOS>
and
I
admire
the
reasons
he
gives
against
a
too
rigorous
and
severe
treatment
of
children
.
  
<EOS>
But
I
will
give
Mr.
Locke
's
words
,
to
which
I
have
some
objection
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
may
be
doubted
,
"
says
he
,
"
concerning
whipping
,
when
,
as
the
last
remedy
,
it
comes
to
be
necessary
,
at
what
time
,
and
by
whom
,
it
should
be
done
;
whether
presently
,
upon
the
committing
the
fault
,
whilst
it
is
yet
fresh
and
hot
.
<EOS>
I
think
it
should
not
be
done
presently
,
"
adds
he
,
"
lest
passion
mingle
with
it
;
and
<EOS>
so
,
though
it
exceed
the
just
proportion
,
yet
it
lose
of
its
due
weight
.
<EOS>
For
even
children
discern
whenever
we
do
things
in
a
passion
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
must
beg
leave
,
dear
Sir
,
to
differ
from
Mr.
Locke
in
this
point
;
for
I
think
it
ought
rather
to
be
a
rule
with
parents
,
who
shall
chastise
their
children
,
to
conquer
what
would
be
extreme
in
their
own
passion
on
this
occasion
(
for
those
who
can
not
do
it
,
are
very
unfit
to
be
the
punishers
of
the
wayward
passions
of
their
children
)
,
than
to
defer
the
punishment
,
especially
if
the
child
knows
its
fault
has
reached
its
parent
's
ear
.
<EOS>
It
is
otherwise
,
methinks
,
giving
the
child
,
if
of
an
obstinate
disposition
,
so
much
more
time
to
harden
its
mind
,
and
bid
defiance
to
its
punishment
.
  
<EOS>
Just
now
,
dear
Sir
,
your
Billy
is
brought
into
my
presence
,
all
smiling
,
crowing
to
come
to
me
,
and
full
of
heart
-
cheering
promises
;
and
the
subject
I
am
upon
goes
to
my
heart
.
<EOS>
Surely
I
can
never
beat
your
Billy
!
 
<EOS>
Dear
little
life
of
my
life
!
<EOS>
how
can
I
think
thou
canst
ever
deserve
it
,
or
that
I
can
ever
inflict
it
?
 
<EOS>
No
,
my
baby
,
that
shall
be
thy
papa
's
task
,
if
ever
thou
art
so
heinously
naughty
;
and
whatever
he
does
,
must
be
right
.
<EOS>
Pardon
my
foolish
fondness
,
<EOS>
dear
Sir
!
 
<EOS>
I
will
proceed
.
  
<EOS>
If
,
then
,
the
fault
be
so
atrocious
as
to
deserve
whipping
,
and
the
parent
be
resolved
on
this
exemplary
punishment
,
the
child
ought
not
,
as
I
imagine
,
to
come
into
one
's
presence
without
meeting
with
it
:
or
else
,
a
fondness
too
natural
to
be
resisted
,
will
probably
get
the
upper
hand
of
one
's
resentment
,
and
how
shall
one
be
able
to
whip
the
dear
creature
one
had
ceased
to
be
angry
with
?
<EOS>
Then
after
he
has
once
seen
one
without
meeting
his
punishment
,
will
he
not
be
inclined
to
hope
for
connivance
at
his
fault
,
unless
it
should
be
repeated
?
<EOS>
And
may
he
not
be
apt
<EOS>
(
for
children
's
resentments
are
strong
)
to
impute
to
cruelty
a
correction
(
when
he
thought
the
fault
had
been
forgotten
)
that
should
always
appear
to
be
inflicted
with
reluctance
,
and
through
motives
of
love
?
  
<EOS>
If
,
from
anger
at
his
fault
,
one
should
go
above
the
due
proportion
,
(
I
am
sure
I
might
be
trusted
for
this
!
)
<EOS>
let
it
take
its
course
!
 
<EOS>
How
barbarously
,
methinks
,
I
speak
!
 
<EOS>
He
ought
to
feel
the
lash
,
first
,
because
he
deserves
it
,
poor
little
soul
?
<EOS>
Next
,
because
it
is
proposed
to
be
exemplary
.
<EOS>
And
,
lastly
,
because
it
is
not
intended
to
be
often
used
:
and
the
very
passion
or
displeasure
one
expresses
(
if
it
be
not
enormous
)
will
shew
one
is
in
earnest
,
and
create
in
him
a
necessary
awe
,
and
fear
to
offend
again
.
<EOS>
The
end
of
the
correction
is
to
shew
him
the
difference
between
right
and
wrong
.
<EOS>
And
as
it
is
proper
to
take
him
at
his
first
offer
of
a
full
submission
and
repentance
(
and
not
before
)
,
and
instantly
dispassionate
one
's
self
,
and
shew
him
the
difference
by
acts
of
pardon
and
kindness
(
which
will
let
him
see
that
one
punishes
him
out
of
necessity
rather
than
choice
)
,
so
one
would
not
be
afraid
to
make
him
smart
so
sufficiently
,
that
he
should
not
soon
forget
the
severity
of
the
discipline
,
nor
the
disgrace
of
it
.
<EOS>
There
's
a
cruel
mamma
for
you
,
Mr.
B.
!
<EOS>
What
my
practice
may
be
,
I
can
not
tell
;
but
this
theory
,
I
presume
to
think
,
is
right
.
  
<EOS>
As
to
the
act
itself
,
I
much
approve
Mr.
Locke
's
advice
,
to
do
it
by
pauses
,
mingling
stripes
and
expostulations
together
,
to
shame
and
terrify
the
more
;
and
the
rather
,
as
the
parent
,
by
this
slow
manner
of
inflicting
the
punishment
,
will
less
need
to
be
afraid
of
giving
too
violent
a
correction
;
for
those
pauses
will
afford
him
,
as
well
as
the
child
,
opportunities
for
consideration
and
reflection
.
  
<EOS>
But
as
to
the
person
,
by
whom
the
discipline
should
be
performed
,
I
humbly
conceive
,
that
this
excellent
author
is
here
also
to
be
objected
to
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
have
a
discreet
servant
,
"
says
he
,
"
capable
of
it
,
and
has
the
place
of
governing
your
child
(
for
if
you
have
a
tutor
,
there
is
no
doubt
)
<EOS>
,
I
think
it
is
best
the
smart
should
come
immediately
from
another
's
hand
,
though
by
the
parent
's
order
,
who
should
see
it
done
,
whereby
the
parent
's
authority
will
be
preserved
,
and
the
child
's
aversion
for
the
pain
it
suffers
,
rather
be
turned
on
the
person
that
immediately
inflicts
it
.
<EOS>
For
I
would
have
a
father
seldom
strike
a
child
,
but
upon
very
urgent
necessity
,
and
as
the
last
remedy
.
<EOS>
"
  
@@@Tis
<EOS>
in
such
an
urgent
case
that
we
are
supposing
that
it
should
be
done
at
all
.
<EOS>
If
there
be
not
a
reason
strong
enough
for
the
father
's
whipping
the
child
himself
,
there
can
not
be
one
for
his
ordering
another
to
do
it
,
and
standing
by
to
see
it
done
.
<EOS>
But
I
humbly
think
,
that
if
there
be
a
necessity
,
no
one
can
be
so
fit
as
the
father
himself
to
do
it
.
<EOS>
The
child
can
not
dispute
his
authority
to
punish
,
from
whom
he
receives
and
expects
all
the
good
things
of
his
life
:
he
can
not
question
his
love
to
him
,
and
after
the
smart
is
over
,
and
his
obedience
secured
,
must
believe
that
so
tender
,
so
indulgent
<EOS>
a
father
could
have
no
other
end
in
whipping
him
,
but
his
good
.

him
,
he
knows
he
has
no
remedy
,
but
must
passively
submit
;
and
when
he
is
convinced
he
must
,
he
will
in
time
conclude
that
he
ought
.
  
<EOS>
But
to
have
this
severe
office
performed
by
a
servant
,
though
at
the
father
's
command
,
and
that
professedly
,
that
the
aversion
of
the
child
for
the
pain
it
suffers
should
be
turned
on
the
person
who
immediately
inflicts
it
,
is
<EOS>
,
I
humbly
think
,
the
reverse
of
what
ought
to
be
done
.
<EOS>
And
more
so
,
if
this
servant
has
any
direction
of
the
child
's
education
;
and
still
much
more
so
,
if
it
be
his
tutor
,
though
Mr.
Locke
says
,
there
is
no
doubt
,
if
there
be
a
tutor
,
that
it
should
be
done
by
him
.
  
<EOS>
For
,
dear
Sir
,
is
there
no
doubt
,
that
the
tutor
should
lay
himself
open
to
the
aversion
of
the
child
,
whose
manners
he
is
to
form
?
<EOS>
Is
not
the
best
method
a
tutor
can
take
,
in
order
to
enforce
the
lessons
he
would
inculcate
,
to
try
to
attract
the
love
and
attention
of
his
pupil
by
the
most
winning
ways
he
can
possibly
think
of
?
<EOS>
And
yet
is
he
,
this
very
tutor
out
of
all
doubt
,
to
be
the
instrument
of
doing
an
harsh
and
disgraceful
thing
,
and
that
in
the
last
resort
,
when
all
other
methods
are
found
ineffectual
;
and
that
too
,
because
he
ought
to
incur
the
child
's
resentment
and
aversion
,
rather
than
the
father
?
<EOS>
No
,
surely
,
Sir
,
it
is
not
reasonable
it
should
be
so
:
<EOS>
quite
contrary
,
in
my
humble
notion
,
there
can
be
no
doubt
,
but
that
it
should
be
otherwise
.
  
<EOS>
It
should
,
methinks
,
be
enough
for
a
tutor
,
in
case
of
a
fault
in
the
child
,
to
threaten
to
complain
to
his
father
;
but
yet
not
to
make
such
a
complaint
,
without
the
child
obstinately
persists
in
his
error
,
which
,
too
,
should
be
of
a
nature
to
merit
such
an
appeal
:
and
this
might
highly
contribute
to
preserve
the
parent
's
authority
;
who
,
on
this
occasion
,
should
never
fail
of
extorting
a
promise
of
amendment
,
or
of
instantly
punishing
him
with
his
own
hands
.
<EOS>
And
,
to
soften
the
distaste
he
might
conceive
in
resentment
of
too
rigid
complainings
,
it
might
not
be
amiss
,
that
his
interposition
in
the
child
's
favour
,
were
the
fault
not
too
flagrant
,
should
be
permitted
to
save
him
once
or
twice
from
the
impending
discipline
.
  
<EOS>
@@@Tis
certain
that
the
passions
,
if
I
may
so
call
them
,
of
affection
and
aversion
,
are
very
early
discoverable
in
children
;
insomuch
that
they
will
,
even
before
they
can
speak
,
afford
us
marks
for
the
detection
of
an
hypocritical
appearance
of
love
to
it
before
the
parents
"
faces
.
<EOS>
For
the
fondness
or
averseness
of
the
child
to
some
servants
,
will
at
any
time
let
one
know
,
whether
their
love
to
the
baby
is
uniform
and
the
same
,
when
one
is
absent
,
as
present
.
<EOS>
In
one
case
the
child
will
reject
with
sullenness
all
the
little
sycophancies
made
to
it
in
one
's
sight
;
while
on
the
other
,
its
fondness
of
the
person
,
who
generally
obliges
it
,
is
an
infallible
rule
to
judge
of
such
an
one
's
sincerity
behind
one
's
back
.
<EOS>
This
little
observation
shews
the
strength
of
a
child
's
resentments
,
and
its
sagacity
,
at
the
earliest
age
,
in
discovering
who
obliges
,
and
who
disobliges
it
:
and
hence
one
may
infer
,
how
improper
a
person
he
is
,
whom
we
would
have
a
child
to
love
and
respect
,
or
by
whose
precepts
we
would
have
it
directed
,
to
be
the
punisher
of
its
faults
,
or
to
do
any
harsh
or
disagreeable
office
to
it
.
  
<EOS>
For
my
own
part
,
I
beg
to
declare
,
that
if
the
parent
were
not
to
inflict
the
punishment
himself
,
I
think
it
much
better
it
should
be
given
him
,
in
the
parent
's
presence
,
by
the
servant
of
the
lowest
consideration
in
the
family
,
and
whose
manners
and
example
one
would
be
the
least
willing
of
any
other
he
should
follow
.
<EOS>
Just
as
the
common
executioner
,
who
is
the
lowest
and
most
flagitious
officer
of
the
commonwealth
,
and
who
frequently
deserves
,
as
much
as
the
criminal
,
the
punishment
he
is
chosen
to
inflict
,
is
pitched
upon
to
perform
,
as
a
mark
of
greater
ignominy
,
sentences
intended
as
examples
to
deter
others
from
the
commission
of
heinous
crimes
.
<EOS>
The
Almighty
took
this
method
when
he
was
disposed
to
correct
severely
his
chosen
people
;
for
,
in
that
case
,
he
generally
did
it
by
the
hands
of
the
most
profligate
nations
around
them
,
as
we
read
in
many
places
of
the
Old
Testament
.
  
<EOS>
But
the
following
rule
I
admire
in
Mr.
Locke
:
"
When
,
"
says
he
(
for
any
misdemeanour
)
,
"
the
father
or
mother
looks
sour
on
the
child
,
every
one
else
should
put
on
the
same
coldness
to
him
,
and
nobody
give
him
countenance
till
forgiveness
is
asked
,
and
a
reformation
of
his
fault
has
set
him
right
again
,
and
restored
him
to
his
former
credit
.
<EOS>
If
this
were
constantly
observed
,
"
adds
he
,
"
I
guess
there
would
be
little
need
of
blows
or
chiding
:
their
own
ease
or
satisfaction
would
quickly
teach
children
to
court
commendation
,
and
avoid
doing
that
which
they
found
every
body
condemned
,
and
they
were
sure
to
suffer
for
,
without
being
chid
or
beaten
.
<EOS>
This
would
teach
them
modesty
and
shame
,
and
they
would
quickly
come
to
have
a
natural
abhorrence
for
that
which
they
found
made
them
slighted
and
neglected
by
every
body
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
affords
me
a
pretty
hint
;
for
if
ever
your
charming
Billy
shall
be
naughty
,
I
will
proclaim
throughout
your
worthy
family
,
that
the
little
dear
is
in
disgrace
!
<EOS>
And
one
shall
shun
him
,
another
decline
answering
him
,
a
third
say
,
"
No
,
master
,
I
can
not
obey
you
,
till
your
mamma
is
pleased
with
you
"
;
a
fourth
,
"
<EOS>
Who
shall
mind
what
little
masters
bid
them
do
,
when
they
wo
n't
mind
what
their
mammas
say
to
them
?
"
<EOS>
And
when
the
dear
little
soul
finds
this
,
he
will
come
in
my
way
,
(
and
I
see
,
pardon
me
,
<EOS>
my
dear
Mr.
B.
,
he
has
some
of
his
papa
's
spirit
,
already
,
indeed
he
has
!
)
<EOS>
and
I
will
direct
myself
with
double
kindness
to
your
beloved
Davers
,
and
to
my
Miss
Goodwin
,
and
not
notice
the
dear
creature
,
if
I
can
help
it
,
till
I
can
see
his
papa
<EOS>
(
forgive
my
boldness
)
banished
from
his
little
sullen
brow
,
and
all
his
mamma
rise
to
his
eyes
.
<EOS>
And
when
his
musical
tongue
shall
be
unlocked
to
own
his
fault
,
and
promise
amendment
 
<EOS>
O
then
!
<EOS>
how
shall
I
clasp
him
to
my
bosom
!
<EOS>
and
tears
of
joy
,
I
know
,
will
meet
his
tears
of
penitence
!
  
<EOS>
How
these
flights
,
dear
Sir
,
please
a
body!-What
delights
have
those
mammas
(
which
some
fashionable
dear
ladies
are
quite
unacquainted
with
)
who
can
make
their
babies
,
and
their
first
educations
,
their
entertainment
and
diversion
!
<EOS>
To
watch
the
dawnings
of
reason
in
them
,
to
direct
their
little
passions
,
as
they
shew
themselves
,
to
this
or
that
particular
point
of
benefit
or
use
;
and
to
prepare
the
sweet
virgin
soil
of
their
minds
to
receive
the
seeds
of
virtue
and
goodness
so
early
,
that
,
as
they
grow
up
,
one
need
only
now
a
little
pruning
,
and
now
a
little
water
,
to
make
them
the
ornaments
and
delights
of
the
garden
of
this
life
!
<EOS>
And
then
their
pretty
ways
,
their
fond
and
grateful
endearments
,
some
new
beauty
every
day
rising
to
observation
 
<EOS>
O
my
dearest
Mr.
B.
,
whose
enjoyments
and
pleasures
are
so
great
,
as
those
of
such
mothers
as
can
bend
their
minds
two
or
three
hours
every
day
to
the
duties
of
the
nursery
?
  
<EOS>
I
have
a
few
other
things
to
observe
upon
Mr.
Locke
's
treatise
,
which
,
when
I
have
done
,
I
shall
read
,
admire
,
and
improve
by
the
rest
,
as
my
years
and
experience
advance
;
of
which
,
in
my
proposed
little
book
,
I
shall
give
you
better
proofs
than
I
am
able
to
do
at
present
;
raw
,
crude
,
and
indigested
as
the
notions
of
so
young
a
mamma
must
needs
be
.
  
<EOS>
But
these
shall
be
the
subjects
of
another
letter
;
for
now
I
am
come
to
the
pride
and
the
pleasure
I
always
have
,
when
I
subscribe
myself
,
dearest
Sir
,
your
ever
dutiful
and
grateful
  
P.B.
    
DEAR
SIR
,
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Locke
gives
a
great
many
very
pretty
instructions
relating
to
the
play
-
games
of
children
:
but
I
humbly
presume
to
object
to
what
he
says
in
one
or
two
places
.
  
<EOS>
He
would
not
indulge
them
in
any
playthings
,
but
what
they
make
themselves
,
or
endeavour
to
make
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
smooth
pebble
,
a
piece
of
paper
,
the
mother
's
bunch
of
keys
,
or
any
thing
they
can
not
hurt
themselves
with
<EOS>
,
"
he
rightly
says
,
"
serve
as
much
to
divert
little
children
,
as
those
more
chargeable
and
curious
toys
from
the
shops
,
which
are
presently
put
out
of
order
,
and
broken
.
"
  
<EOS>
These
playthings
may
certainly
do
for
little
ones
:
but
methinks
,
to
a
person
of
easy
circumstances
,
since
the
making
these
toys
employs
the
industrious
poor
,
the
buying
them
for
the
child
might
be
complied
with
,
though
they
were
easily
broken
;
and
especially
as
they
are
of
all
prices
,
and
some
less
costly
,
and
more
durable
than
others
.
  
<EOS>
"
Tops
,
gigs
,
battledores
,
"
Mr.
Locke
observes
,
"
which
are
to
be
used
with
labour
,
should
indeed
be
procured
them
 
not
for
variety
,
but
exercise
;
but
if
they
had
a
top
,
the
scourge
-
stick
and
leather
strap
should
be
left
to
their
own
making
and
fitting
.
"
  
<EOS>
But
I
may
presume
to
say
,
that
whatever
be
the
good
Mr.
Locke
proposes
by
this
<EOS>
,
it
can
not
be
equal
to
the
mischief
children
may
do
themselves
in
making
these
playthings
!
<EOS>
For
must
they
not
have
implements
to
work
with
?
<EOS>
and
is
not
a
knife
,
or
other
edged
tool
,
without
which
it
is
impossible
they
can
make
or
shape
a
scourge
-
stick
,
or
any
of
their
playthings
,
a
fine
instrument
in
a
child
's
hands
!
<EOS>
This
advice
is
the
reverse
of
the
caution
warranted
from
all
antiquity
,
That
it
is
dangerous
to
meddle
with
edged
tools
!
<EOS>
and
I
am
afraid
,
the
tutor
must
often
act
the
surgeon
,
and
follow
the
indulgence
with
a
styptic
and
plaister
;
and
the
young
gentleman
's
hands
might
be
so
often
bound
up
as
to
be
one
way
to
cure
him
of
his
earnest
desire
to
play
;
but
I
can
hardly
imagine
any
other
good
that
it
can
do
him
;
for
I
doubt
the
excellent
consequences
proposed
by
our
author
from
this
doctrine
,
such
as
to
teach
the
child
moderation
in
his
desires
,
application
,
industry
,
thought
,
contrivance
,
and
good
husbandry
,
qualities
that
,
as
he
says
,
will
be
useful
to
him
when
he
is
a
man
,
are
too
remote
to
be
ingrafted
upon
such
beginnings
;
although
it
must
be
confessed
,
that
,
as
Mr.
Locke
wisely
observes
,
good
habits
and
industry
can
not
be
too
early
inculcated
.
  
<EOS>
But
then
,
Sir
,
may
I
ask
,
Are
not
the
very
plays
and
sports
,
to
which
children
accustom
themselves
,
whether
they
make
their
own
playthings
or
not
,
equivalent
to
the
work
or
labour
of
grown
persons
!
<EOS>
Yes
,
Sir
,
I
will
venture
to
say
,
they
are
,
and
more
than
equivalent
to
the
exercises
and
labour
of
many
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Locke
advises
,
that
the
child
's
playthings
should
be
as
few
as
possible
,
which
I
entirely
approve
:
that
they
should
be
in
his
tutor
's
power
,
who
is
to
give
him
but
one
at
once
.
<EOS>
But
since
it
is
the
nature
of
the
human
mind
to
court
most
what
is
prohibited
,
and
to
set
light
by
what
is
in
its
own
power
;
I
am
half
doubtful
(
only
that
Mr.
Locke
says
it
,
and
it
may
not
be
so
very
important
as
other
points
,
in
which
I
have
ventured
to
differ
from
that
gentleman
)
,
whether
the
child
's
absolute
possession
of
his
own
playthings
in
some
little
repository
,
of
which
he
may
be
permitted
to
keep
the
key
,
especially
if
he
makes
no
bad
use
of
the
privilege
,
would
not
make
him
more
indifferent
to
them
:
while
the
contrary
conduct
might
possibly
enhance
his
value
of
them
.
<EOS>
And
if
,
when
he
had
done
with
any
plaything
,
he
were
obliged
to
put
it
into
its
allotted
place
,
and
were
accustomed
to
keep
account
of
the
number
and
places
of
them
severally
;
this
would
teach
him
order
,
and
at
the
same
time
instruct
him
to
keep
a
proper
account
of
them
,
and
to
avoid
being
a
squanderer
or
waster
:
and
if
he
should
omit
to
put
his
playthings
in
their
places
,
or
be
careless
of
them
,
<EOS>
the
taking
them
away
for
a
time
,
or
threatening
to
give
them
to
others
,
would
make
him
the
more
heedful
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Locke
says
,
that
he
has
known
a
child
so
distracted
with
the
number
and
variety
of
his
playthings
,
that
he
tired
his
maid
every
day
to
look
them
over
:
and
was
so
accustomed
to
abundance
,
that
he
never
thought
he
had
enough
,
but
was
always
asking
,
"
What
more
?
<EOS>
What
new
thing
shall
I
have
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
A
good
introduction
,
"
adds
he
,
ironically
,
"
to
moderate
desires
,
and
the
ready
way
to
make
a
contented
happy
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
All
that
I
shall
offer
to
this
,
is
,
that
few
men
are
so
philosophical
as
one
would
wish
them
to
be
,
much
less
children
.
<EOS>
But
,
no
doubt
,
this
variety
engaged
the
child
's
activity
;
which
,
of
the
two
might
be
turned
to
better
purposes
than
sloth
or
indolence
;
and
if
the
maid
was
tired
,
it
might
be
,
because
she
was
not
so
much
alive
as
the
child
;
and
perhaps
this
part
of
the
grievance
might
not
be
so
great
,
because
if
she
was
his
attendant
,
'
tis
probable
she
had
nothing
else
to
do
.
  
<EOS>
However
,
in
the
main
,
as
Mr.
Locke
says
,
it
is
no
matter
how
few
playthings
the
child
is
indulged
with
;
but
yet
I
can
hardly
persuade
myself
,
that
plenty
of
them
can
have
such
bad
consequences
as
he
apprehends
;
and
the
rather
,
because
they
will
excite
his
attention
,
and
promote
his
industry
and
activity
.
<EOS>
His
enquiry
after
new
things
,
let
him
have
few
or
many
,
is
to
be
expected
as
a
consequence
to
those
natural
desires
which
are
implanted
in
him
,
and
will
every
day
increase
:
but
this
may
be
observed
,
that
as
he
grows
in
years
,
he
will
be
above
some
playthings
,
and
so
the
number
of
the
old
ones
will
be
always
reducible
,
perhaps
in
a
greater
proportion
,
than
the
new
ones
will
increase
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
head
of
good
-
breeding
,
he
observes
,
that
,
"
there
are
two
sorts
of
ill
-
breeding
;
the
one
a
sheepish
bashfulness
,
and
the
other
a
misbecoming
negligence
and
disrespect
in
our
carriage
;
both
which
,
"
says
he
,
"
are
avoided
by
duly
observing
this
one
rule
,
not
to
think
meanly
of
ourselves
,
and
not
to
think
meanly
of
others
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
as
Mr.
Locke
explains
this
rule
,
it
is
an
excellent
one
.
<EOS>
But
I
would
beg
to
observe
upon
it
,
that
however
discommendable
a
bashful
temper
is
,
in
some
instances
,
where
it
must
be
deemed
a
weakness
of
the
mind
,
yet
,
in
my
humble
opinion
,
it
is
generally
the
mark
of
an
ingenuous
one
,
and
is
always
to
be
preferred
to
an
undistinguishing
and
hardy
confidence
,
which
,
as
it
seems
to
me
,
is
the
genuine
production
of
invincible
ignorance
.
  
<EOS>
What
is
faulty
in
it
,
which
he
calls
sheepishness
,
should
indeed
be
shaken
off
as
soon
as
possible
,
because
it
is
an
enemy
to
merit
in
its
advancement
in
the
world
:
<EOS>
but
,
Sir
,
were
I
to
choose
a
companion
for
your
Billy
,
as
he
grows
up
<EOS>
,
I
should
not
think
the
worse
of
the
youth
,
who
,
not
having
had
the
opportunities
of
knowing
men
,
or
seeing
the
world
,
had
this
defect
.
<EOS>
On
the
contrary
,
I
should
be
apt
to
look
upon
it
as
an
outward
fence
or
inclosure
to
his
virtue
,
which
might
keep
off
the
lighter
attacks
of
immorality
,
the
Hussars
of
vice
,
as
I
may
say
,
who
are
not
able
to
carry
on
a
formal
siege
against
his
morals
;
and
I
should
expect
such
a
one
to
be
docile
,
humane
,
good
-
humoured
,
diffident
of
himself
,
and
therefore
most
likely
to
improve
as
well
in
mind
as
behaviour
:
while
a
hardened
mind
,
that
never
doubts
itself
,
must
be
a
stranger
to
its
own
infirmities
,
and
suspecting
none
,
is
impetuous
,
over
-
bearing
,
incorrigible
;
and
,
if
rich
,
a
tyrant
;
if
not
,
possibly
an
invader
of
other
men
's
properties
;
or
at
least
,
such
a
one
as
allows
itself
to
walk
so
near
the
borders
of
injustice
,
that
where
self
is
concerned
,
it
hardly
ever
does
right
things
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Locke
proposes
(
Section
148
)
a
very
pretty
method
to
cheat
children
,
as
it
were
,
into
learning
:
but
then
he
adds
,
"
There
may
be
dice
and
playthings
,
with
the
letters
on
them
,
to
teach
children
the
alphabet
by
playing
.
"
<EOS>
And
(
Section
151
)
"
<EOS>
I
know
a
person
of
great
quality
,
who
,
by
pasting
on
the
six
vowels
(
for
in
our
language
y
is
one
)
on
the
six
sides
of
a
dice
,
and
the
remaining
eighteen
consonants
on
the
sides
of
three
other
dice
,
has
made
this
a
play
for
his
children
,
that
he
shall
win
,
who
at
one
cast
throws
most
words
on
these
four
dice
;
whereby
his
eldest
son
,
yet
in
coats
,
has
played
himself
into
spelling
with
great
eagerness
,
and
without
once
having
been
chid
for
it
,
or
forced
to
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
But
I
had
rather
<EOS>
your
Billy
should
be
a
twelvemonth
backwarder
for
want
of
this
method
,
than
forwarded
by
it
.
<EOS>
For
what
may
not
be
feared
from
so
early
inculcating
the
use
of
dice
and
gaming
,
upon
the
minds
of
children
?
<EOS>
Let
Mr.
Locke
himself
speak
to
this
in
his
Section
208
,
and
I
wish
I
could
reconcile
the
two
passages
in
this
excellent
author
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
to
cards
and
dice
,
"
says
he
,
<EOS>
"
I
think
the
safest
and
best
way
is
,
never
to
learn
any
play
upon
them
,
and
so
to
be
incapacitated
for
these
dangerous
temptations
,
and
encroaching
wasters
of
useful
time
.
"
<EOS>
And
,
he
might
have
added
,
of
the
noblest
estates
and
fortunes
;
while
sharpers
and
scoundrels
have
been
lifted
into
distinction
upon
their
ruins
.
<EOS>
Yet
,
in
Sec
.
<EOS>
153
,
Mr.
Locke
proceeds
to
give
directions
in
relation
to
the
dice
he
recommends
.
  
<EOS>
But
after
all
,
if
some
innocent
plays
were
fixed
upon
to
cheat
children
into
reading
,
that
,
as
he
says
,
should
look
as
little
like
a
task
as
possible
,
it
must
needs
be
of
use
for
that
purpose
.
<EOS>
But
let
every
gentleman
,
who
has
a
fortune
to
lose
,
and
who
,
if
he
games
,
is
on
a
foot
with
the
vilest
company
,
who
generally
have
nothing
at
all
to
risque
,
tremble
at
the
thoughts
of
teaching
his
son
,
though
for
the
most
laudable
purposes
,
the
early
use
of
dice
and
gaming
.
  
<EOS>
But
how
much
I
am
charmed
with
a
hint
in
Mr.
Locke
,
which
makes
your
Pamela
hope
<EOS>
,
she
may
be
of
greater
use
to
your
children
,
even
as
they
grow
up
,
than
she
could
ever
have
flattered
herself
to
be
.
'
<EOS>
Tis
<EOS>
a
charming
paragraph
;
I
must
not
skip
one
word
of
it
.
<EOS>
Thus
it
begins
,
and
I
will
observe
upon
it
as
I
go
along
.
<EOS>
Sec
.
<EOS>
177
:
<EOS>
"
But
under
whose
care
soever
a
child
is
put
to
be
taught
,
during
the
tender
and
flexible
years
of
his
life
,
this
is
certain
,
it
should
be
one
who
thinks
Latin
and
language
the
least
part
of
education
.
"
  
<EOS>
How
agreeable
is
this
to
my
notions
;
which
I
durst
not
have
avowed
,
but
after
so
excellent
a
scholar
!
<EOS>
For
I
have
long
had
the
thought
,
that
much
time
is
wasted
to
little
purpose
in
the
attaining
of
Latin
.
<EOS>
Mr.
H.
,
I
think
,
says
he
was
ten
years
in
endeavouring
to
learn
it
,
and
,
as
far
as
I
can
find
,
knows
nothing
at
all
of
the
matter
neither
!
 
<EOS>
Indeed
he
lays
that
to
the
wicked
picture
in
his
grammar
,
which
he
took
for
granted
(
as
he
has
often
said
,
as
well
as
once
written
)
was
put
there
to
teach
boys
to
rob
orchards
,
instead
of
improving
their
minds
in
learning
,
or
common
honesty
.
  
<EOS>
But
(
for
this
is
too
light
an
instance
for
the
subject
)
<EOS>
Mr.
Locke
proceeds
 
"
One
who
knowing
how
much
virtue
and
a
well
-
tempered
soul
is
to
be
preferred
to
any
sort
of
learning
or
language
,
"
[
What
a
noble
writer
is
this
!
]
<EOS>
"
makes
it
his
chief
business
to
form
the
mind
of
his
scholars
,
and
give
that
a
right
disposition
:
"
[
Ay
,
there
,
dear
Sir
,
is
the
thing
!
]
<EOS>
"
which
,
if
once
got
,
though
all
the
rest
should
be
neglected
,
"
[
charmingly
observed
!
]
<EOS>
"
would
,
in
due
time
,
"
[
without
wicked
dice
,
I
hope
!
]
<EOS>
"
produce
all
the
rest
;
and
which
,
if
it
be
not
got
and
settled
,
so
to
keep
out
ill
and
vicious
habits
,
languages
and
sciences
,
and
all
the
other
accomplishments
of
education
,
will
be
to
no
purpose
,
but
to
make
the
worse
or
more
dangerous
man
.
"
<EOS>
[
Now
comes
the
place
I
am
so
much
delighted
with
!
]
<EOS>
"
And
indeed
,
whatever
stir
there
is
made
about
getting
of
Latin
,
as
the
great
and
difficult
business
,
his
mother
"
[
thank
you
,
dear
Sir
,
for
putting
this
excellent
author
into
my
hands
!
]
<EOS>
"
may
teach
it
him
herself
,
if
she
will
but
spend
two
or
three
hours
in
a
day
with
him

"
[
If
she
will

<EOS>
Never
fear
,

I
will
,
with
the
highest
pleasure
in

<EOS>
"
and
make
him
read
the
Evangelists
in
Latin
to
her
.
"
<EOS>
[
How
I
long
to
be
five
or
six
years
older
,
as
well
as
my
dearest
babies
,
that
I
may
enter
upon
this
charming
scheme
!
]
<EOS>
"
For
she
need
but
buy
a
Latin
Testament
,
and
having
got
somebody
to
mark
the
last
syllable
but
<EOS>
one
,
where
it
is
long
,
in
words
above
two
syllables
(
which
is
enough
to
regulate
her
pronunciation
and
accenting
the
words
)
,
read
daily
in
the
Gospels
,
and
then
let
her
avoid
understanding
them
in
Latin
,
if
she
can
.
"
  
<EOS>
Why
,
dear
Sir
,
you
have
taught
me
almost
all
this
already
;
and
you
,
my
beloved
tutor
,
have
told
me
often
,
I
read
and
pronounce
Latin
more
than
tolerably
,
though
I
do
n't
understand
it
:
but
this
method
will
teach
me
,
as
well
as
your
dear
children
 
<EOS>
But
thus
the
good
gentleman
proceeds
 
<EOS>
"
And
when
she
understands
the
Evangelists
in
Latin
,
let
her
in
the
same
manner
read
Aesop
's
Fables
,
and
so
proceed
on
to
Eutropius
,
Justin
,
and
such
other
books
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
mention
this
,
"
adds
Mr.
Locke
,
"
as
an
imagination
of
what
I
fancy
may
do
,
but
as
of
a
thing
I
have
known
done
,
and
the
Latin
tongue
got
with
ease
this
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
then
mentions
other
advantages
,
which
the
child
may
receive
from
his
mother
's
instruction
,
which
I
will
try
more
and
more
to
qualify
myself
for
:
particularly
,
after
he
has
intimated
,
that
"
at
the
same
time
that
the
child
is
learning
French
and
Latin
,
he
may
be
entered
also
in
arithmetic
,
geography
,
chronology
,
history
,
and
geometry
too
;
for
if
,
"
says
he
,
"
these
be
taught
him
in
French
or
Latin
,
when
he
begins
once
to
understand
either
of
these
tongues
,
he
will
get
a
knowledge
of
these
sciences
,
and
the
language
to
boot
.
"
<EOS>
He
then
proceeds
:
"
Geography
,
I
think
,
should
be
begun
with
:
for
the
learning
of
the
figure
of
the
globe
,
the
situation
and
boundaries
of
the
four
parts
of
the
world
,
and
that
of
particular
kingdoms
and
countries
,
being
only
an
exercise
of
the
eyes
and
memory
,
a
child
with
pleasure
will
learn
and
retain
them
.
<EOS>
And
this
is
so
certain
,
that
I
now
live
in
a
house
with
a
child
,
whom
his
MOTHER
has
so
well
instructed
this
way
in
geography

<EOS>
[
<EOS>
But
had
she
not
,
do
you
think
,
<EOS>
dear
Sir
,
some
of
this
good
gentleman
's
kind
assistance

<EOS>
"
that
he
knew
the
limits
of
the
four
parts

readily
point
,
being
asked
,
to
any
country
upon
the
globe

any
county

knew
all
the
great

promontories

streights

bays
in

could
find
the
longitude

six
years
old

"
  
<EOS>
There
's
for
you
,
dear
Sir

<EOS>
See
what
a
mother
can
do
if
she
pleases
!
  
<EOS>
I
remember
,
Sir
,
formerly
,
in
that
sweet
chariot
conference
,
at
the
dawning
of
my
hopes
,
when
all
my
dangers
were
happily
over
(
a
conference
I
shall
always
think
of
with
pleasure
)
,
that
you
asked
me
,
how
I
would
bestow
my
time
,
supposing
the
neighbouring
ladies
would
be
above
being
seen
in
my
company
;
when
I
should
have
no
visits
to
receive
or
return
;
no
parties
of
pleasure
to
join
in
;
no
card
-
tables
to
employ
my
winter
evenings
?
  
<EOS>
I
then
,
Sir
,
transported
with
my
opening
prospects
,
prattled
to
you
,
how
well
I
would
try
to
pass
my
time
,
in
the
family
management
and
accounts
,
in
visits
now
and
then
to
the
indigent
and
worthy
poor
;
in
music
sometimes
;
in
reading
,
in
writing
,
in
my
superior
duties
 
<EOS>
And
I
hope
I
have
not
behaved
quite
unworthily
of
my
promise
.
  
<EOS>
But
I
also
remember
,
<EOS>
what
once
you
said
on
a
certain
occasion
,
which
now
,
since
the
fair
prospect
is
no
longer
distant
,
and
that
I
have
been
so
long
your
happy
wife
,
I
may
repeat
without
those
blushes
which
then
covered
my
face
;
thus
then
,
with
a
modest
grace
,
and
with
that
virtuous
endearment
that
is
so
beautiful
in
your
sex
,
as
well
as
in
ours
,
whether
in
the
character
of
lover
or
husband
,
maiden
or
wife
,
you
were
pleased
to
say
 
"
And
I
hope
,
my
Pamela

to
have
superadded
to
all
these
,
such
an
employment
as
"
in
short
,
Sir
,
I
am
now
blessed
with
,
and
writing
of
;
no
less
than
the
useful
part
I
may
be
able
to
take
in
the
first
education
of
your
beloved
babies

<EOS>
And
now
I
must
add
,
that
this
pleasing
hope
sets
me
above
all
other
diversions
<EOS>
:
I
wish
for
no
parties
of
pleasure
but
with
you
,
my
dearest
Mr.
B.
,
and
these
are
parties
that
will
improve
me
,
and
make
me
more
capable
of
the
other
,
and
more
worthy
of
your
conversation
,
and
of
the
time
you
pass
(
beyond
what
I
could
ever
have
promised
to
my
utmost
wishes
)
in
such
poor
company
as
mine
,
for
no
other
reason
<EOS>
but
because
I
love
to
be
instructed
,
and
take
my
lessons
well
,
as
you
are
pleased
to
say
;
and
indeed
I
must
be
a
sad
dunce
,
if
I
did
not
,
from
so
skilful
and
so
beloved
a
master
.
<EOS>
I
want
no
card
-
table
amusements
;
for
I
hope
,
in
a
few
years
(
and
a
proud
hope
it
is
)
,
to
be
able
to
teach
your
dear
little
ones
the
first
rudiments
,
as
Mr.
Locke
points
the
way
,
of
Latin
,
of
French
,
and
of
geography
,
and
arithmetic
.
  
<EOS>
O
,
my
dear
Mr.
B.
,
by
your
help
and
countenance
,
what
may
I
not
be
able
to
teach
them
,
and
how
may
I
prepare
the
way
for
a
tutor
's
instructions
,
and
give
him
up
minds
half
cultivated
to
his
hands
!
 
<EOS>
And
all
this
time
improve
myself
too
,
not
only
in
science
,
but
in
nature
,
by
tracing
in
the
little
babes
what
all
mankind
are
,
and
have
been
,
from
infancy
to
riper
years
,
and
watching
the
sweet
dawnings
of
reason
,
and
delighting
in
every
bright
emanation
of
that
ray
of
divinity
,
lent
to
the
human
mind
,
for
great
and
happy
purposes
,
when
rightly
pointed
and
directed
.
  
<EOS>
There
is
no
going
farther
after
these
charming
recollections
and
hopes
,
for
they
bring
me
to
that
grateful
remembrance
,
to
whom
,
under
God
,
I
owe
them
all
,
and
also
what
I
have
been
for
so
happy
a
period
,
and
what
I
am
,
which
will
ever
be
my
pride
and
my
glory
;
and
well
it
may
,
when
I
look
back
to
my
beginning
with
humble
acknowledgment
,
and
can
call
myself
,
dearest
Mr.
B.
,
your
honoured
and
honouring
,
and
,
I
hope
to
say
,
in
time
,
useful
wife
,
P.B.
    
MY
DEAREST
MR
.
<EOS>
B.
,
  
Having
in
my
former
letters
said
as
much
as
is
necessary
to
let
you
into
my
notion
of
the
excellent
book
you
put
into
my
hands
,
and
having
touched
those
points
in
which
the
children
of
both
sexes
may
be
concerned
(
with
some
art
in
my
intention
,
I
own
)
,
in
hope
that
they
would
not
be
so
much
out
of
the
way
,
as
to
make
you
repent
of
the
honour
you
have
done
me
,
in
committing
the
dear
Miss
Goodwin
to
my
care
;
I
shall
now
very
quickly
set
myself
about
the
proposed
little
book
.
  
<EOS>
You
have
been
so
good
as
to
tell
me
<EOS>
(
at
the
same
time
that
you
disapprove
not
these
my
specimen
letters
as
I
may
call
them
)
,
that
you
will
kindly
accept
of
my
intended
present
,
and
encourage
me
to
proceed
in
it
;
and
as
I
shall
leave
one
side
of
the
leaf
blank
for
your
corrections
and
alterations
,
those
corrections
will
be
a
fine
help
and
instruction
to
me
in
the
pleasing
task
which
I
propose
to
myself
,
of
assisting
in
the
early
education
of
your
dear
children
.
<EOS>
And
as
I
may
be
years
in
writing
it
,
as
the
dear
babies
improve
,
as
I
myself
improve
,
by
the
opportunities
which
their
advances
in
years
will
give
me
,
and
the
experience
I
shall
gain
,
I
may
then
venture
to
give
my
notions
on
the
more
material
and
nobler
parts
of
education
,
as
well
as
the
inferior
:
for
(
but
that
I
think
the
subjects
above
my
present
abilities
)
<EOS>
Mr.
Locke
's
book
would
lead
me
into
several
remarks
,
that
might
not
be
unuseful
,
and
which
appear
to
me
entirely
new
;
though
that
may
be
owing
to
my
slender
reading
and
opportunities
,
perhaps
.
  
<EOS>
But
what
I
would
now
touch
upon
,
is
a
word
or
two
still
more
particularly
upon
the
education
of
my
own
sex
;
a
topic
which
naturally
arises
to
me
from
the
subject
of
my
last
letter
.
<EOS>
For
there
,
dear
Sir
,
we
saw
,
that
the
mothers
might
teach
the
child
this
part
of
science
,
and
that
part
of
instruction
;
and
who
,
I
pray
,
as
our
sex
is
generally
educated
,
shall
teach
the
mothers
?
<EOS>
How
,
in
a
word
,
shall
they
come
by
their
knowledge
?
  
<EOS>
I
know
you
'll
be
apt
to
say
,
that
Miss
Goodwin
gives
all
the
promises
of
becoming
a
fine
young
lady
,
and
takes
her
learning
,
loves
reading
,
and
makes
very
pretty
reflections
upon
all
she
reads
,
and
asks
very
pertinent
questions
,
and
is
as
knowing
,
at
her
years
,
as
most
young
ladies
.
<EOS>
This
is
very
true
,
Sir
;
but
it
is
not
every
one
that
can
boast
of
Miss
Goodwin
's
capacity
,
and
goodness
of
temper
,
which
have
enabled
her
to
get
up
a
good
deal
of
lost
time
,
as
I
must
call
it
;
for
her
first
four
years
were
a
perfect
blank
,
as
far
as
I
can
find
,
just
as
if
the
pretty
dear
was
born
the
day
she
was
four
years
old
;
for
what
she
had
to
unlearn
as
to
temper
,
and
will
,
and
such
things
,
set
against
what
little
improvements
she
had
made
,
might
very
fairly
be
compounded
for
,
as
a
blank
.
  
<EOS>
I
would
indeed
have
a
girl
brought
up
to
her
needle
,
but
I
would
not
have
all
her
time
employed
in
samplers
,
and
learning
to
mark
,
and
do
those
unnecessary
things
,
which
she
will
never
,
probably
,
be
called
upon
to
practise
.
  
<EOS>
And
why
,
pray
,
are
not
girls
entitled
to
the
same
first
education
,
though
not
to
the
same
plays
and
diversions
,
as
boys
;
so
far
,
at
least
,
as
is
supposed
by
Mr.
Locke
<EOS>
a
mother
can
instruct
them
?
  
<EOS>
Would
not
this
lay
a
foundation
for
their
future
improvement
,
and
direct
their
inclinations
to
useful
subjects
,
such
as
would
make
them
above
the
imputations
of
some
unkind
gentlemen
,
who
allot
to
their
part
common
tea
-
table
prattle
,
while
they
do
all
they
can
to
make
them
fit
for
nothing
else
,
and
then
upbraid
them
for
it
?
<EOS>
And
would
not
the
men
find
us
better
and
more
suitable
companions
and
assistants
to
them
in
every
useful
purpose
of
life
?
 
<EOS>
O
that
your
lordly
sex
were
all
like
my
dear
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
 
I
do
n't
mean
that
they
should
all
take
raw
,
uncouth
,
unbred
,
lowly
girls
,
as
I
was
,
from
the
cottage
,
and
,
destroying
all
distinction
<EOS>
,
make
such
their
wives
;
for
there
is
a
far
greater
likelihood
,
that
such
a
one
,
when
she
comes
to
be
lifted
up
into
so
dazzling
a
sphere
,
would
have
her
head
made
giddy
with
her
exaltation
,
than
that
she
would
balance
herself
well
in
it
:
and
to
what
a
blot
,
over
all
the
fair
page
of
a
long
life
,
would
this
little
drop
of
dirty
ink
spread
itself
!
<EOS>
What
a
standing
disreputation
to
the
choice
of
a
gentleman
!
  
<EOS>
But
this
I
mean
,
that
after
a
gentleman
had
entered
into
the
marriage
state
with
a
young
creature
(
saying
nothing
at
all
of
birth
or
descent
)
far
inferior
to
him
in
learning
,
in
parts
,
in
knowledge
of
the
world
,
and
in
all
the
graces
which
make
conversation
agreeable
and
improving
,
he
would
,
as
you
do
,
endeavour
to
make
her
fit
company
for
himself
,
as
he
shall
find
she
is
willing
to
improve
,
and
capable
of
improvement
:
that
he
would
direct
her
taste
,
point
out
to
her
proper
subjects
for
her
amusement
and
instruction
;
travel
with
her
now
<EOS>
and
then
,
a
month
in
a
year
perhaps
;
and
shew
her
the
world
,
after
he
has
encouraged
her
to
put
herself
forward
at
his
own
table
,
and
at
the
houses
of
his
friends
,
and
has
seen
,
that
she
will
not
do
him
great
discredit
<EOS>
any
where
.
<EOS>
What
obligations
,
and
opportunities
too
,
will
this
give
her
to
love
and
honour
such
a
husband
,
every
hour
,
more
and
more
!
<EOS>
as
she
will
see
his
wisdom
in
a
thousand
instances
,
and
experience
his
indulgence
to
her
in
ten
thousand
,
to
the
praise
of
his
politeness
,
and
the
honour
of
them
both
!
 
<EOS>
And
then
,
when
select
parties
of
pleasure
or
business
engaged
him
not
abroad
,
in
his
home
conversation
,
to
have
him
delight
to
instruct
and
open
her
views
,
and
inspire
her
with
an
ambition
to
enlarge
her
mind
,
and
more
and
more
to
excel
!
<EOS>
What
an
intellectual
kind
of
married
life
would
such
persons
find
theirs
!
<EOS>
And
how
suitable
to
the
rules
of
policy
and
self
-
love
in
the
gentleman
;
for
is
not
the
wife
,
and
are
not
her
improvements
,
all
his
own
?
 
<EOS>
Absolutely
,
as
I
may
say
,
his
own
?
<EOS>
And
does
not
every
excellence
<EOS>
she
can
be
adorned
by
,
redound
to
her
husband
's
honour
because
she
is
his
,
even
more
than
to
her
own
!
 
<EOS>
In
like
manner
as
no
dishonour
affects
a
man
so
much
,
as
that
which
he
receives
from
a
bad
wife
.
  
<EOS>
But
where
is
such
a
gentleman
as
Mr.
B.
to
be
met
with
?
<EOS>
Look
round
and
see
where
,
with
all
the
advantages
of
sex
,
of
education
,
of
travel
,
of
conversation
in
the
open
world
,
a
gentleman
of
his
abilities
to
instruct
and
inform
,
is
to
be
found
?
<EOS>
And
there
are
others
,
who
,
perhaps
,
will
question
the
capacities
or
inclinations
of
our
sex
in
general
,
to
improve
in
useful
knowledge
,
<EOS>
were
they
to
meet
with
such
kind
instructors
,
either
in
the
characters
of
parents
or
husbands
.
  
<EOS>
As
to
the
first
,
I
grant
,
that
it
is
not
easy
to
find
such
a
gentleman
:
<EOS>
but
for
the
second
(
if
excusable
in
me
,
who
am
one
of
the
sex
,
and
so
may
be
thought
partial
to
it
)
<EOS>
,
I
could
by
comparisons
drawn
from
the
gentlemen
and
ladies
within
the
circle
of
my
own
acquaintance
,
produce
instances
,
which
are
so
flagrantly
in
their
favour
,
as
might
make
it
suspected
,
that
it
is
policy
more
than
justice
,
in
those
who
would
keep
our
sex
unacquainted
with
that
more
eligible
turn
of
education
,
which
gives
the
gentlemen
so
many
advantages
over
us
in
that
;
and
which
will
shew
,
they
have
none
at
all
in
nature
or
genius
.
  
<EOS>
I
know
you
will
pardon
me
,
dear
Sir
;
for
you
are
so
exalted
above
your
Pamela
,
by
nature
and
education
too
,
that
you
can
not
apprehend
any
inconvenience
from
bold
comparisons
.
<EOS>
I
will
beg
,
therefore
,
to
mention
a
few
instances
among
our
friends
,
where
the
ladies
,
notwithstanding
their
more
cramped
and
confined
education
,
make
more
than
an
equal
figure
with
the
gentlemen
in
all
the
graceful
parts
of
conversation
,
in
spite
of
the
contempts
poured
out
upon
our
sex
by
some
witty
gentlemen
,
whose
writings
I
have
in
my
eye
.
  
<EOS>
To
begin
then
with
Mr.
Murray
,
and
Miss
Damford
that
was
;
Mr.
Murray
has
the
reputation
of
scholarship
,
and
has
travelled
too
;
but
how
infinitely
is
he
surpassed
in
every
noble
and
useful
quality
,
and
in
greatness
of
mind
,
and
judgment
,
as
well
as
wit
,
by
the
young
lady
I
have
named
!
<EOS>
This
we
saw
,
when
last
at
the
Hall
,
in
fifty
instances
,
where
the
gentleman
was
,
you
know
,
Sir
,
on
a
visit
to
Sir
Simon
and
his
lady
.
  
<EOS>
Next
,
dear
Sir
,
permit
me
to
observe
,
that
my
good
Lord
Davers
,
with
all
his
advantages
,
born
a
counsellor
of
the
realm
,
and
educated
accordingly
,
does
not
surpass
his
lady
.
  
<EOS>
My
countess
,
as
I
delight
to
call
her
,
and
Lady
Betty
,
her
eldest
daughter
,
greatly
surpassed
the
Earl
and
her
eldest
brother
in
every
point
of
knowledge
,
and
even
learning
,
as
I
may
say
,
although
both
ladies
owe
that
advantage
principally
to
their
own
cultivation
and
acquirement
.
  
<EOS>
Let
me
presume
,
Sir
,
to
name
Mr.
H.
:
and
when
I
have
named
him
,
shall
we
not
be
puzzled
to
find
any
where
in
our
sex
,
one
remove
from
vulgar
life
,
a
woman
that
will
not
out
-
do
Mr.
H.
?
  
<EOS>
Lady
Darnford
,
upon
all
useful
subjects
,
makes
a
much
brighter
figure
than
Sir
Simon
,
whose
knowledge
of
the
world
has
not
yet
made
him
acquainted
with
himself
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Arthur
excels
not
his
lady
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Towers
,
a
maiden
lady
,
is
an
over
-
match
for
half
a
dozen
of
the
neighbouring
gentlemen
I
could
name
,
in
what
is
called
wit
and
politeness
,
and
not
inferior
to
any
of
them
in
judgment
.
  
<EOS>
I
could
multiply
such
instances
,
were
it
needful
,
to
the
confutation
of
that
low
,
and
I
had
almost
said
,
unmanly
contempt
,
with
which
a
certain
celebrated
genius
treats
our
sex
in
general
in
most
of
his
pieces
,
I
have
seen
;
particularly
his
Letter
of
Advice
to
a
new
married
Lady
;
<EOS>
so
written
,
as
must
disgust
,
instead
of
instruct
;
and
looks
more
like
the
advice
of
an
enemy
to
the
sex
,
and
a
bitter
one
too
,
than
a
friend
to
the
particular
Lady
.
<EOS>
But
I
ought
to
beg
pardon
for
this
my
presumption
,
for
two
reasons
:
first
,
because
of
the
truly
admirable
talents
of
this
writer
;
and
next
,
because
we
know
not
what
ladies
the
ingenious
gentleman
may
have
fallen
among
in
his
younger
days
.
  
<EOS>
Upon
the
whole
,
therefore
,
I
conclude
,
that
Mr.
B.
is
almost
the
only
gentleman
,
who
excels
every
lady
that
I
have
seen
;
so
greatly
excels
,
that
even
the
emanations
of
his
excellence
irradiate
a
low
cottage
-
born
girl
,
and
make
her
pass
among
ladies
of
birth
and
education
for
somebody
.
  
<EOS>
Forgive
my
pride
,
dear
Sir
;
but
it
would
be
almost
a
crime
in
your
Pamela
not
to
exult
in
the
mild
benignity
of
those
rays
,
by
which
her
beloved
Mr.
B.
endeavours
to
make
her
look
up
to
his
own
sunny
sphere
:
while
she
,
by
the
advantage
only
of
his
reflected
glory
,
in
his
absence
,
which
makes
a
dark
night
to
her
,
glides
along
with
her
paler
and
fainter
beaminess
,
and
makes
a
distinguishing
figure
among
such
lesser
planets
,
as
can
only
poorly
twinkle
and
glimmer
,
for
want
of
the
aid
she
boasts
of
.
  
<EOS>
I
dare
not
,
Sir
,
conjecture
whence
arises
this
more
than
parity
in
the
genius
of
the
sexes
,
among
the
above
persons
,
notwithstanding
the
disparity
of
education
,
and
the
difference
in
the
opportunities
of
each
.
<EOS>
This
might
lead
one
into
too
proud
a
thought
in
favour
of
a
sex
too
contemptuously
treated
by
some
other
wits
I
could
name
,
who
,
indeed
,
are
the
less
to
be
regarded
,
as
they
love
to
jest
upon
all
God
Almighty
's
works
:
yet
might
I
better
do
it
,
too
,
than
anybody
,
since
I
am
so
infinitely
transcended
by
my
husband
,
that
no
competition
,
pride
or
vanity
,
could
be
apprehended
from
me
.
  
<EOS>
But
,
however
,
I
would
only
beg
of
those
who
are
so
free
in
their
contempts
of
us
,
that
they
would
,
for
their
own
sakes
(
and
that
,
with
such
generally
goes
a
great
way
)
,
rather
try
to
improve
than
depreciate
us
:
<EOS>
we
should
then
make
better
daughters
,
better
wives
,
better
mothers
,
and
better
mistresses
:
and
who
(
permit
me
,
Sir
,
to
ask
them
)
would
be
so
much
the
better
for
these
opportunities
and
amendments
,
as
our
upbraiders
themselves
!
  
<EOS>
On
re
-
perusing
this
,
I
must
repeatedly
beg
your
excuse
for
these
proud
notions
in
behalf
of
my
sex
,
which
,
I
can
truly
say
,
are
not
owing
to
partiality
because
,
I
have
the
honour
to
be
one
of
it
;
but
to
a
far
better
motive
;
for
what
does
this
contemptuous
treatment
of
one
half
,
if
not
the
better
half
,
of
the
human
species
,
naturally
produce
,
but
libertinism
and
abandoned
wickedness
?
<EOS>
for
does
it
not
tend
to
make
the
daughters
,
the
sisters
,
the
wives
of
gentlemen
,
the
subjects
of
profligate
attempts
?
 
<EOS>
Does
it
not
render
the
sex
vile
in
the
eyes
of
the
most
vile
?
<EOS>
And
when
a
lady
is
no
longer
beheld
by
such
persons
with
that
dignity
and
reverence
,
with
which
perhaps
,
the
graces
of
her
person
,
and
the
innocence
of
her
mind
,
should
sacredly
,
as
it
were
,
encompass
her
,
do
not
her
very
excellencies
become
so
many
incentives
for
base
wretches
to
attempt
her
virtue
,
and
bring
about
her
ruin
?
  
<EOS>
What
then
may
not
wicked
wit
have
to
answer
for
,
when
its
possessors
prostitute
it
to
such
unmanly
purposes
!
<EOS>
And
as
if
they
had
never
had
a
mother
,
a
sister
,
a
daughter
of
their
own
,
throw
down
,
as
much
as
in
them
lies
,
those
sacred
fences
which
may
lay
the
fair
inclosure
open
to
the
invasions
of
every
clumsier
and
viler
beast
of
prey
;
who
,
though
destitute
of
their
wit
,
yet
corrupted
by
it
,
shall
fill
their
mouths
,
as
well
as
their
hearts
,
with
the
borrowed
mischief
,
and
propagate
it
from
one
to
another
to
the
end
of
time
;
and
who
,
otherwise
,
would
have
passed
by
the
uninvaded
fence
,
and
only
shewed
their
teeth
,
and
snarled
at
the
well
secured
fold
within
it
?
  
<EOS>
You
can
not
,
my
dearest
Mr.
B.
,
I
know
be
angry
at
this
romantic
painting
:
since
you
are
not
affected
by
it
:
for
when
at
worst
,
you
acted
(
more
dangerously
,
'
tis
true
,
for
the
poor
innocents
)
a
principal
part
,
and
were
as
a
lion
among
beasts
 
<EOS>
Do
,
<EOS>
dear
Sir
,
let
me
say
among
,
this
one
time
 
You
scorned
to
borrow
any
man
's
wit
;
and
if
nobody
had
followed
your
example
,
till
they
had
had
your
qualities
,
the
number
of
rakes
would
have
been
but
small
.
<EOS>
Yet
,
do
n't
mistake
me
,
neither
;
I
am
not
so
mean
as
to
bespeak
your
favour
by
extenuating
your
failings
;
if
I
were
,
you
would
deservedly
despise
me
.
<EOS>
For
,
undoubtedly
(
I
must
say
it
,
Sir
)
,
your
faults
were
the
greater
for
your
perfections
:
and
such
talents
misapplied
,
as
they
made
you
more
capable
of
mischief
,
so
did
they
increase
the
evil
of
your
practices
.
<EOS>
All
then
that
I
mean
by
saying
you
are
not
affected
by
this
painting
,
is
,
that
you
are
not
affected
by
my
description
of
clumsy
and
sordid
rakes
,
whose
wit
is
borrowed
,
and
their
wickedness
only
what
they
may
call
their
own
.
  
<EOS>
Then
,
dear
Sir
,
since
that
noble
conversation
you
held
with
me
at
Tunbridge
,
in
relation
to
the
consequences
that
might
,
had
it
not
been
for
God
's
grace
intervening
,
have
followed
the
masquerade
affair
,
I
have
the
inexpressible
pleasure
to
find
a
thorough
reformation
,
from
the
best
motives
,
taking
place
;
and
your
joining
with
me
in
my
closet
(
as
opportunity
permits
)
in
my
evening
duties
,
is
the
charming
confirmation
of
your
kind
and
voluntary
,
and
I
am
proud
to
say
,
pious
assurances
;
so
that
this
makes
me
fearless
of
your
displeasure
,
while
I
rather
triumph
in
my
joy
for
your
precious
soul
's
sake
,
than
presume
to
think
of
recriminating
;
and
when
(
only
for
this
once
)
I
take
the
liberty
of
looking
back
from
the
delightful
now
,
to
the
painful
formerly
!
  
<EOS>
But
,
what
a
rambler
am
I
again
!
<EOS>
You
command
me
to
write
to
you
all
I
think
,
without
fear
.
<EOS>
I
obey
,
and
,
as
the
phrase
is
,
do
it
without
either
fear
or
wit
.
  
<EOS>
If
you
are
not
displeased
,
it
is
a
mark
of
the
true
nobleness
of
your
nature
,
and
the
sincerity
of
your
late
pious
declarations
.
  
<EOS>
If
you
are
,
I
shall
be
sure
I
have
done
wrong
in
having
applied
a
corrosive
to
eat
away
the
proud
flesh
of
a
wound
,
that
is
not
yet
so
thoroughly
digested
,
as
to
bear
a
painful
application
,
and
requires
balsam
and
a
gentler
treatment
.
<EOS>
But
when
we
were
at
Bath
,
I
remember
what
you
said
once
of
the
benefit
of
retrospection
:
and
you
charged
me
,
whenever
a
proper
opportunity
offered
,
to
remind
you
,
by
that
one
word
,
retrospection
,
of
the
charming
conversation
we
had
there
,
on
our
return
from
the
rooms
.
  
<EOS>
If
this
be
not
one
of
them
,
forgive
,
dearest
Sir
,
the
unreasonableness
of
your
very
impertinent
,
but
,
in
intention
and
resolution
,
ever
dutiful
,
  
P.B.
    
<EOS>
From
Mrs.
B.
to
her
Father
and
Mother
  
EVER
DEAR
,
AND
EVER
HONOURED
,
  
I
must
write
this
one
letter
,
although
I
have
had
the
happiness
to
see
you
so
lately
;
because
Mr.
B.
is
now
about
to
honour
me
with
the
tour
he
so
kindly
promised
;
and
it
may
therefore
be
several
months
,
perhaps
,
before
I
have
again
the
pleasure
of
paying
you
the
like
dutiful
respects
.
  
<EOS>
You
know
his
kind
promise
,
that
he
would
for
every
dear
baby
<EOS>
I
present
him
with
,
take
an
excursion
with
me
afterwards
,
in
order
to
establish
and
confirm
my
health
.
  
<EOS>
The
task
I
have
undertaken
of
dedicating
all
my
writing
amusements
to
the
dearest
of
men
;
the
full
employment
I
have
,
when
at
home
;
the
frequent
rambles
he
has
so
often
indulged
me
in
,
with
my
dear
Miss
Goodwin
,
to
Kent
,
London
,
Bedfordshire
,
Lincolnshire
,
and
to
my
lady
Davers
,
take
from
me
the
necessity
of
writing
to
you
,
to
my
Miss
Damford
that
was
,
and
to
Lady
Davers
,
so
often
as
I
formerly
thought
myself
obliged
to
do
,
when
I
saw
all
my
worthy
friends
so
seldom
;
the
same
things
,
moreover
,
with
little
variation
,
occurring
this
year
,
as
to
our
conversations
,
visits
,
friends
,
employments
,
and
amusements
,
that
fell
out
the
last
,
as
must
be
the
case
in
a
family
so
uniform
and
methodical
as
ours
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
for
these
reasons
,
more
leisure
to
pursue
my
domestic
duties
,
which
are
increased
upon
me
;
and
when
I
have
said
,
that
I
am
every
day
more
and
more
happy
in
my
beloved
Mr.
B.
,
in
Miss
Goodwin
,
my
Billy
,
my
Davers
,
and
now
,
newly
,
in
my
sweet
little
Pamela
(
for
so
,
you
know
,
Lady
Davers
would
have
her
called
,
rather
than
by
her
own
name
)
,
what
can
I
say
more
?
  
<EOS>
As
to
the
tour
I
spoke
of
,
you
know
,
the
first
part
of
Mr.
B.
's
obliging
scheme
is
to
carry
me
to
France
;
for
he
has
already
travelled
with
me
over
the
greatest
part
of
England
;
and
I
am
sure
,
by
my
passage
last
year
,
to
the
Isle
of
Wight
<EOS>
,
I
shall
not
be
afraid
of
crossing
the
water
from
Dover
thither
;
and
he
will
,
when
we
are
at
Paris
,
he
says
,
take
my
farther
directions
(
that
was
his
kind
expression
)
<EOS>
whither
to
go
next
.
  
<EOS>
My
Lord
and
Lady
Davers
are
so
good
as
to
promise
to
accompany
us
to
Paris
,
provided
Mr.
B.
will
give
them
our
company
to
Aix
-
la
-
Chapelle
,
for
a
month
or
six
weeks
,
whither
my
lord
is
advised
to
go
.
<EOS>
And
Mr.
H.
if
he
can
get
over
his
fear
of
crossing
the
salt
water
,
is
to
be
of
the
party
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
G.
,
Miss
Damford
that
was
(
who
likewise
has
lately
lain
-
in
of
a
fine
daughter
)
,
and
I
,
are
to
correspond
as
opportunity
offers
;
and
she
promises
to
send
you
what
I
write
,
as
formerly
:
but
I
have
refused
to
say
one
word
in
my
letters
of
the
manners
,
customs
,
curiosities
,
&
c.
of
the
places
we
see
;
because
,
first
,
I
shall
not
have
leisure
;
and
,
next
,
those
things
are
so
much
better
described
in
books
written
by
persons
who
made
stricter
and
better
observations
that
I
can
pretend
to
make
:
so
that
what
I
shall
write
will
relate
only
to
our
private
selves
,
and
be
as
brief
as
possible
.
  
<EOS>
If
we
are
to
do
as
Mr.
B.
has
it
in
his
thoughts
,
he
intends
to
be
out
of
England
two
years
:
 
<EOS>
but
how
can
I
bear
that
,
if
for
your
sakes
only
,
and
for
those
of
my
dear
babies
!
 
<EOS>
But
this
must
be
my
time
,
my
only
time
,
Mr.
B.
says
,
to
ramble
and
see
distant
places
and
countries
;
for
as
soon
as
his
little
ones
are
capable
of
my
instructions
,
and
begin
to
understand
my
looks
and
signs
,
he
will
not
spare
me
from
them
a
week
together
;
and
he
is
so
kind
as
to
propose
,
that
my
dear
bold
boy
(
for
every
one
sees
how
greatly
he
resembles
his
papa
in
his
dear
forward
spirit
)
<EOS>
shall
go
with
us
;
and
this
pleases
Miss
Goodwin
highly
,
who
is
very
fond
of
him
,
and
my
little
Davers
;
but
vows
she
will
never
love
so
well
my
pretty
black
-
eyed
Pamela
.
  
<EOS>
You
see
what
a
sweet
girl
Miss
is
,
and
you
admired
her
much
:
did
I
tell
you
,
what
she
said
to
me
,
when
first
she
saw
you
both
,
with
your
silver
hairs
,
and
reverend
countenances
?
 
<EOS>
"
Madam
,
I
dare
say
,
your
papa
,
and
mamma
,
honoured
their
father
and
mother
:
"
 
<EOS>
"
They
did
,
my
dear
;
but
what
is
your
reason
for
saying
so
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Because
they
have
lived
so
long
in
the
land
which
the
LORD
their
GOD
has
given
them
.
<EOS>
"
I
took
the
charmer
in
my
arms
,
and
kissed
her
three
or
four
times
,
as
she
deserved
;
for
was
not
this
very
pretty
in
the
child
?
  
<EOS>
I
must
,
with
inexpressible
pleasure
,
write
you
word
how
happily
God
's
providence
has
now
,
at
last
,
turned
that
affair
,
which
once
made
me
so
uneasy
,
in
relation
to
the
fine
Countess
(
who
has
been
some
time
abroad
)
,
of
whom
you
had
heard
,
as
you
told
me
,
some
reports
,
which
,
had
you
known
at
the
time
,
would
have
made
you
very
apprehensive
for
Mr.
B.
's
morals
,
as
well
as
for
my
repose
.
  
<EOS>
I
will
now
(
because
I
can
do
it
with
the
highest
pleasure
,
by
reason
of
the
event
it
has
produced
)
,
explain
that
dark
affair
so
far
as
shall
make
you
judges
of
my
present
joy
:
although
I
had
hitherto
avoided
entering
into
that
subject
to
you
.
<EOS>
For
now
I
think
myself
,
by
God
's
grace
,
secure
to
the
affection
and
fidelity
of
the
best
of
husbands
,
and
that
from
the
worthiest
motives
;
as
you
shall
hear
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
but
one
thing
wanting
to
complete
all
the
happiness
I
wished
for
in
this
life
;
which
was
,
the
remote
hope
I
had
entertained
,
that
one
day
,
my
dear
Mr.
B.
who
from
a
licentious
gentleman
became
a
moralist
,
would
be
so
touched
by
the
divine
grace
,
as
to
become
in
time
,
more
than
moral
,
a
religious
man
,
and
,
at
last
,
join
in
the
duties
which
he
had
the
goodness
to
countenance
.
  
<EOS>
For
this
reason
I
began
with
mere
indispensables
.
<EOS>
I
crowded
not
his
gates
with
objects
of
charity
:
I
visited
them
at
their
homes
,
and
relieved
them
;
distinguishing
the
worthy
indigent
(
made
so
by
unavoidable
accidents
and
casualties
)
from
the
wilfully
,
or
perversely
,
or
sottishly
such
,
by
greater
marks
of
my
favour
.
  
<EOS>
I
confined
my
morning
and
evening
devotions
to
my
own
private
closet
,
lest
I
should
give
offence
and
discouragement
to
so
gay
a
temper
,
so
unaccustomed
(
poor
gentleman
!
)
<EOS>
to
acts
of
devotion
and
piety
<EOS>
;
whilst
I
met
his
household
together
,
only
on
mornings
and
evenings
of
the
Sabbath
-
day
,
to
prepare
them
for
their
public
duties
in
the
one
,
and
in
hopes
to
confirm
them
in
what
they
had
heard
at
church
in
the
other
;
leaving
them
to
their
own
reflections
for
the
rest
of
the
week
;
after
I
had
suggested
a
method
I
wished
them
to
follow
,
and
in
which
they
constantly
obliged
me
.
  
<EOS>
This
good
order
had
its
desired
effect
,
and
our
Sabbath
-
day
assemblies
were
held
with
so
little
parade
,
that
we
were
hardly
any
of
us
missed
.
<EOS>
All
,
in
short
,
was
done
with
cheerful
ease
and
composure
:
and
every
one
of
us
was
better
disposed
to
our
domestic
duties
:
I
,
to
attend
the
good
pleasure
of
my
best
friend
;
and
they
,
that
of
us
both
.
  
<EOS>
Thus
we
went
on
very
happily
,
my
neighbourly
visits
of
charity
,
taking
up
no
more
time
than
common
airings
,
and
passing
many
of
them
for
such
;
my
private
duties
being
only
between
my
FIRST
,
my
HEAVENLY
BENEFACTOR
,
and
myself
,
and
my
family
ones
personally
confined
to
the
day
separated
for
these
best
of
services
,
and
Mr.
B.
pleased
with
my
manner
beheld
the
good
effects
,
and
countenanced
me
by
his
praises
and
his
endearments
,
as
acting
discreetly
,
as
not
falling
into
enthusiasm
,
and
(
as
he
used
to
say
)
as
not
aiming
at
being
righteous
overmuch
.
  
<EOS>
But
still
I
wanted
,
and
waited
for
,
with
humble
patience
,
and
made
it
part
of
my
constant
prayers
,
that
the
divine
Grace
would
at
last
touch
his
heart
,
and
make
him
more
than
a
countenancer
,
more
than
an
applauder
of
my
duties
;
that
he
might
for
his
own
dear
sake
,
become
a
partaker
in
them
.
"
<EOS>
And
then
,
"
thought
I
,
"
when
we
can
,
hand
in
hand
,
heart
in
heart
,
one
spirit
as
well
as
one
flesh
,
join
in
the
same
closet
,
in
the
same
prayers
and
thanksgiving
,
what
a
happy
creature
shall
I
be
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
say
,
closet
:
<EOS>
for
I
durst
not
aspire
so
high
,
as
to
hope
the
favour
of
his
company
among
his
servants
,
in
our
Sunday
devotions
.
 
<EOS>
I
knew
it
would
be
going
too
far
,
in
his
opinion
,
to
expect
it
from
him
.
<EOS>
In
me
their
mistress
,
had
I
been
ever
so
high
-
born
,
it
was
not
amiss
,
because
I
,
and
they
,
every
one
of
us
,
were
his
;
<EOS>
I
in
one
degree
,
Mr.
Longman
in
another
,
Mrs.
Jervis
in
another
 
<EOS>
But
from
a
man
of
his
high
temper
and
manner
of
education
,
I
knew
I
could
never
hope
for
it
,
so
would
not
lose
every
thing
,
by
grasping
at
too
much
.
  
<EOS>
But
in
the
midst
of
all
these
comfortable
proceedings
,
and
my
further
charming
hopes
,
a
nasty
masquerade
threw
into
his
way
a
temptation
,
which
for
a
time
blasted
all
my
prospects
,
and
indeed
made
me
doubt
my
own
head
almost
.
<EOS>
For
,
judge
my
disappointment
,
when
I
found
all
my
wishes
frustrated
,
all
my
prayers
rendered
ineffectual
;
his
very
morality
,
which
I
had
flattered
myself
,
in
time
,
I
should
be
an
humble
instrument
to
exalt
into
religion
,
shocked
,
and
in
danger
;
and
all
the
work
to
begin
over
again
,
if
offended
Grace
should
ever
again
offer
itself
to
the
dear
wilful
trespasser
!
  
<EOS>
But
who
should
pretend
to
scrutinize
the
councils
of
the
Almighty
?
 
<EOS>
for
out
of
all
this
evil
appearance
was
to
proceed
the
real
good
<EOS>
,
I
had
been
so
long
,
and
so
often
,
supplicating
for
!
  
<EOS>
The
dear
man
was
to
be
on
the
brink
of
relapsing
<EOS>
:
it
was
proper
,
that
I
should
be
so
very
uneasy
,
as
to
assume
a
conduct
not
natural
to
my
temper
,
and
to
raise
his
generous
concern
for
me
:
and
,
in
the
very
crisis
,
divine
Grace
interposed
,
made
him
sensible
of
his
danger
,
made
him
resolve
against
his
error
,
before
it
was
yet
too
late
:
and
<EOS>
his
sliding
feet
,
quitting
the
slippery
path
he
was
in
,
collected
new
strength
,
and
he
stood
the
firmer
and
more
secure
for
his
peril
.
  
<EOS>
For
having
happily
put
a
stop
to
that
affair
,
and
by
his
uniform
conduct
,
for
a
considerable
time
,
shewed
me
that
I
had
nothing
to
apprehend
from
it
,
he
was
pleased
,
when
we
were
last
at
Tunbridge
,
and
in
very
serious
discourse
upon
divine
subjects
,
to
say
to
this
effect
:
"
Is
there
not
,
my
Pamela
,
a
text
,
That
the
unbelieving
husband
shall
be
saved
by
the
believing
wife
,
whilst
he
beholds
her
chaste
conversation
coupled
with
fear
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
need
not
tell
you
,
my
dear
Mr.
B.
,
that
there
is
,
nor
where
it
is
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
,
my
dear
,
I
begin
to
hope
,
that
will
be
my
case
;
<EOS>
for
,
from
a
former
affair
,
of
which
this
spot
of
ground
puts
me
more
in
mind
,
I
see
so
much
reason
to
doubt
my
own
strength
,
which
I
had
built
,
and
,
as
I
thought
securely
,
on
moral
foundations
,
that
I
must
look
out
for
a
better
guide
to
conduct
me
,
than
the
proud
word
honour
can
be
,
in
the
general
acceptance
of
it
among
us
lively
young
gentlemen
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
often
have
I
promised
<EOS>
(
and
I
never
promised
but
I
intended
to
perform
)
<EOS>
that
I
would
be
faithfully
and
only
yours
!
<EOS>
How
often
declared
,
that
I
did
not
think
I
could
possibly
deserve
my
Pamela
,
till
I
could
shew
her
,
in
my
own
mind
,
a
purity
as
nearly
equal
to
hers
,
as
my
past
conduct
would
admit
of
!
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
depended
too
much
upon
my
own
strength
:
and
I
am
now
convinced
,
that
nothing
but
RELIGIOUS
CONSIDERATIONS
,
and
a
resolution
to
watch
over
the
very
first
appearances
of
evil
,
and
to
check
them
as
they
arise
,
can
be
of
sufficient
weight
to
keep
steady
to
his
good
purpose
,
a
vain
young
man
,
too
little
accustomed
to
restraint
,
and
too
much
used
to
play
upon
the
brink
of
dangers
,
from
a
temerity
,
and
love
of
intrigue
,
natural
to
enterprising
minds
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
not
make
this
declaration
of
my
convictions
to
you
,
till
I
had
thoroughly
examined
myself
,
and
had
reason
to
hope
,
that
I
should
be
enabled
to
make
it
good
.
<EOS>
And
now
,
my
Pamela
,
from
this
instant
you
shall
be
my
guide
;
and
,
only
taking
care
,
that
you
do
not
,
all
at
once
,
by
injunctions
too
rigorous
,
damp
and
discourage
the
rising
flame
,
I
will
leave
it
to
you
to
direct
as
you
please
,
till
,
by
degrees
<EOS>
,
it
may
be
deemed
worthy
to
mingle
with
your
own
.
"
  
<EOS>
Judge
<EOS>
how
rapturous
my
joy
was
upon
this
occasion
,
and
how
ready
I
was
to
bless
God
for
a
danger
(
so
narrowly
escaped
)
which
was
attended
with
the
very
consequences
that
I
had
so
long
prayed
for
;
and
which
I
little
thought
the
divine
providence
was
bringing
about
by
the
very
means
,
that
,
I
apprehended
,
would
put
an
end
to
all
my
pleasing
hopes
and
prospects
of
that
nature
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
in
vain
for
me
to
seek
words
to
express
what
I
felt
,
and
how
I
acted
,
on
this
occasion
.
<EOS>
I
heard
him
out
with
twenty
different
and
impatient
emotions
;
and
then
threw
myself
at
his
feet
,
embracing
his
knees
,
with
arms
the
most
ardently
clasped
!
<EOS>
My
face
lifted
up
to
Heaven
,
and
to
him
,
by
turns
;
my
eyes
overflowing
with
tears
of
joy
,
which
half
choked
up
the
passage
of
my
words
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
,
his
kind
arms
clasping
my
neck
,
and
kissing
my
tearful
cheek
<EOS>
,
I
could
only
say
 
"
My
ardent
prayers
,
are
at
last
-
heard
 
<EOS>
May
God
Almighty
confirm
your
pious
purposes
!
<EOS>
And
,
Oh
I
<EOS>
what
a
happy
Pamela
have
you
at
your
feet
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
wept
for
joy
till
I
sobbed
again
 
<EOS>
and
he
raising
me
to
his
kind
arms
<EOS>
,
I
said
 
"
To
have
this
heavenly
prospect
,
O
best
beloved
of
my
heart
!
<EOS>
added
to
all
my
earthly
blessings
!
 
<EOS>
How
shall
I
contain
my
joy
!
 
<EOS>
For
,
oh
!
to
think
that
he
is
,
and
will
be
mine
,
and
I
his
,
through
the
mercies
of
God
,
when
this
transitory
life
is
past
and
gone
,
to
all
eternity
;
what
a
rich
thought
is
this
!
 
<EOS>
Methinks
I
am
already
,
dear
Sir
,
ceasing
to
be
mortal
,
and
beginning
to
taste
the
perfections
of
those
joys
,
which
this
thrice
welcome
declaration
gives
me
hope
of
hereafter
!
 
<EOS>
But
what
shall
I
say
,
obliged
as
I
was
beyond
expression
before
,
and
now
doubly
obliged
in
the
rapturous
view
you
have
opened
to
me
,
into
a
happy
futurity
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
said
,
he
was
delighted
with
me
beyond
expression
;
that
I
was
his
ecstatic
charmer
!
 
<EOS>
That
the
love
I
shewed
for
his
future
good
was
the
moving
proof
of
the
purity
of
my
heart
,
and
my
affection
for
him
.
<EOS>
And
that
very
evening
he
joined
with
me
in
my
retired
duties
;
and
,
at
all
proper
opportunities
,
favours
me
with
his
company
in
the
same
manner
;
listening
attentively
to
all
my
lessons
,
as
he
calls
my
cheerful
discourses
on
serious
subjects
.
  
<EOS>
And
now
,
my
dear
parents
,
do
you
not
rejoice
with
me
in
this
charming
,
charming
appearance
?
<EOS>
For
,
before
I
had
the
most
generous
,
the
most
beneficent
,
the
most
noble
,
the
most
affectionate
,
but
now
I
am
likely
to
have
the
most
pious
,
of
husbands
!
<EOS>
What
a
happy
wife
,
what
a
happy
daughter
,
is
his
and
your
Pamela
!
<EOS>
God
of
his
infinite
mercy
,
continue
and
improve
the
ravishing
prospect
!
  
<EOS>
I
was
forced
to
leave
off
here
,
to
enjoy
the
charming
reflections
,
which
this
lovely
subject
,
and
my
blessed
prospects
,
filled
me
with
;
and
now
proceed
to
write
a
few
lines
more
.
  
<EOS>
I
am
under
some
concern
on
account
of
our
going
to
travel
into
some
Roman
Catholic
countries
,
for
fear
we
should
want
the
public
opportunities
of
divine
service
:
for
I
presume
,
the
ambassador
's
chapel
will
be
the
only
Protestant
place
of
worship
allowed
of
,
and
Paris
the
only
city
in
France
where
there
is
one
.
<EOS>
But
we
must
endeavour
to
make
it
up
in
our
private
and
domestic
duties
:
<EOS>
for
,
as
the
phrase
is
 
<EOS>
"
When
we
are
at
Rome
,
we
must
do
as
they
do
at
Rome
;
"
that
is
to
say
,
so
far
as
not
to
give
offence
,
on
the
one
hand
,
to
the
people
we
are
among
;
nor
scandal
,
on
the
other
,
by
compliances
hurtful
to
one
's
conscience
.
<EOS>
But
my
protector
knows
all
these
things
so
well
<EOS>
(
no
place
in
what
is
called
the
grand
tour
,
being
new
to
him
)
,
<EOS>
that
I
have
no
reason
to
be
very
uneasy
.
  
<EOS>
And
now
let
me
,
by
letter
,
as
I
did
on
my
knees
at
parting
,
beg
the
continuance
of
your
prayers
and
blessings
,
and
that
God
will
preserve
us
to
one
another
,
and
give
us
,
and
all
our
worthy
friends
,
a
happy
meeting
again
.
  
<EOS>
Kent
,
you
may
be
sure
,
will
be
our
first
visit
,
on
our
return
,
for
your
sakes
,
for
my
dear
Davers
's
,
and
<EOS>
my
little
Pamela
's
sake
,
who
will
be
both
put
into
your
protection
;
while
my
Billy
,
and
Miss
Goodwin
(
for
,
since
I
began
this
letter
<EOS>
,
it
is
so
determined
)
,
are
to
be
my
delightful
companions
;
for
Mr.
B.
declared
,
his
temper
wants
looking
after
,
and
his
notices
of
every
thing
are
strong
and
significant
.
  
<EOS>
Poor
little
dear
!
<EOS>
he
has
indeed
a
little
sort
of
perverseness
and
headstrongness
,
as
one
may
say
,
in
his
will
:
yet
he
is
but
a
baby
,
and
I
hope
to
manage
him
pretty
well
;
for
he
notices
all
I
say
,
and
every
look
of
mine
already
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
,
besides
,
very
good
humoured
,
and
willing
to
part
with
anything
for
a
kind
word
:
and
this
gives
me
hopes
of
a
docile
and
benevolent
disposition
,
as
he
grows
up
.
  
<EOS>
I
thought
,
when
I
began
the
last
paragraph
but
one
,
that
I
was
within
a
line
of
concluding
;
but
it
is
to
you
,
and
of
my
babies
,
I
am
writing
;
so
shall
go
on
to
the
bottom
of
this
new
sheet
,
if
I
do
not
directly
finish
:
which
I
do
,
with
assuring
you
both
,
that
wherever
I
am
,
I
shall
always
be
thoughtful
of
you
,
and
remember
you
in
my
prayers
,
as
becomes
your
ever
dutiful
daughter
,
<EOS>
P.B.
  
My
respects
to
all
your
good
neighbours
in
general
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Longman
will
visit
you
now
and
then
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jervis
will
take
one
journey
into
Kent
,
she
says
,
and
it
shall
be
to
accompany
my
babies
,
when
carried
down
to
you
.
<EOS>
Poor
Jonathan
,
and
she
,
good
folks
!
<EOS>
seem
declining
in
their
health
,
which
grieves
me
.
 
<EOS>
Once
more
,
God
send
us
all
a
happy
meeting
,
if
it
be
his
blessed
will
!
<EOS>
Adieu
,
adieu
,
my
dear
parents
!

your
ever
dutiful

<EOS>
My
Dear
Lady
G.
,
  
<EOS>
I
received
your
last
letter
at
Paris
,
as
we
were
disposing
every
thing
for
our
return
to
England
,
after
an
absence
of
near
two
years
;
in
which
,
as
I
have
informed
you
,
from
time
to
time
,
I
have
been
a
great
traveller
,
into
Holland
,
the
Netherlands
,
through
the
most
considerable
province
of
France
,
into
Italy
;
and
,
in
our
return
to
Paris
again
(
the
principal
place
of
our
residence
)
,
through
several
parts
of
Germany
.
  
<EOS>
I
told
you
of
the
favours
and
civilities
we
received
at
Florence
,
from
the
then
Countess
Dowager
of
 
,
who
,
with
her
humble
servant
Lord
C
#
#
#
#
(
that
had
so
assiduously
attended
her
for
so
many
months
in
Italy
)
,
accompanied
us
from
Florence
to
Inspruck
.
  
<EOS>
Her
ladyship
made
that
worthy
lord
happy
in
about
a
month
after
she
parted
from
us
,
and
the
noble
pair
gave
us
an
opportunity
at
Paris
,
in
their
way
to
England
,
to
return
some
of
the
civilities
which
we
received
from
them
in
Italy
;
and
they
are
now
arrived
at
her
ladyship
's
seat
on
the
Forest
.
  
<EOS>
Her
lord
is
exceedingly
fond
of
her
,
as
he
well
may
;
for
she
is
one
of
the
most
charming
ladies
in
England
;
and
behaves
to
him
with
so
much
prudence
and
respect
,
that
they
are
as
happy
in
each
other
as
can
be
wished
.
<EOS>
And
let
me
just
add
,
that
both
in
Italy
and
at
Paris
,
Mr.
B.
's
demeanour
and
her
ladyship
's
to
one
another
,
was
so
nobly
open
,
and
unaffectedly
polite
,
as
well
as
highly
discreet
,
that
neither
Lord
C.
who
had
once
been
jealous
of
Mr.
B.
nor
the
other
party
,
who
had
had
a
tincture
of
the
same
yellow
evil
,
as
you
know
,
because
of
the
Countess
,
had
so
much
as
a
shadow
of
uneasiness
remaining
on
the
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
Lord
Davers
has
had
his
health
(
which
had
begun
to
decline
in
England
)
<EOS>
so
well
,
that
there
was
no
persuading
Lady
Davers
to
return
before
now
,
although
I
begged
and
prayed
I
might
not
have
another
little
Frenchman
,
for
fear
they
should
,
as
they
grew
up
,
forget
,
as
I
pleasantly
used
to
say
,
the
obligations
which
their
parentage
lays
them
under
to
dearer
England
.
  
<EOS>
And
now
,
my
dearest
friend
,
I
have
shut
up
my
rambles
for
my
whole
life
;
for
three
little
English
folks
,
and
one
little
Frenchman
(
but
a
charming
baby
as
well
as
the
rest
,
Charley
by
name
)
,
and
a
near
prospect
of
a
further
increase
,
you
will
say
,
are
family
enough
to
employ
all
my
cares
at
home
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
told
you
,
from
time
to
time
,
although
I
could
not
write
to
you
so
often
as
I
would
,
because
of
our
being
constantly
in
motion
,
what
was
most
worthy
of
your
knowledge
relating
to
every
particular
,
and
how
happy
we
all
have
been
in
one
another
.
<EOS>
And
I
have
the
pleasure
to
confirm
to
you
what
I
have
often
written
,
that
Mr.
B.
and
my
Lord
and
Lady
Davers
are
all
that
I
could
wish
and
hope
for
,
with
regard
to
their
first
duties
.
<EOS>
We
are
indeed
a
happy
family
,
united
by
the
best
and
most
solid
ties
!
  
<EOS>
Miss
Goodwin
is
a
charming
young
lady
!
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
express
how
much
I
love
her
.
<EOS>
She
is
a
perfect
mistress
of
the
French
language
and
speaks
Italian
very
prettily
!
<EOS>
And
,
as
to
myself
,
I
have
improved
so
well
under
my
dear
tutor
's
lessons
,
together
with
the
opportunity
of
conversing
with
the
politest
and
most
learned
gentry
of
different
nations
,
that
I
will
discourse
with
you
in
two
or
three
languages
,
if
you
please
,
when
I
have
the
happiness
to
see
you
.
<EOS>
There
's
a
learned
boaster
for
you
,
my
dear
friend
!
<EOS>
(
if
the
knowledge
of
different
languages
makes
one
learned
.
)
 
<EOS>
But
I
shall
bring
you
an
heart
as
entirely
English
as
ever
,
for
all
that
!
  
<EOS>
We
landed
on
Thursday
last
at
Dover
,
and
directed
our
course
to
the
dear
farm
-
house
;
and
you
can
better
imagine
,
than
I
express
,
our
meeting
with
my
dear
father
and
mother
,
and
my
beloved
Davers
and
Pamela
,
who
are
charming
babies
.
 
<EOS>
But
is
not
this
the
language
of
every
fond
mamma
?
  
<EOS>
Miss
Goodwin
is
highly
delighted
now
with
my
sweet
little
Pamela
,
and
says
,
she
shall
be
her
sister
indeed
!
"
<EOS>
For
,
Madam
,
"
said
she
,
"
Miss
is
a
beauty
!
 
<EOS>
And
we
see
no
French
beauties
like
Master
Davers
and
Miss.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Beauty
!
<EOS>
my
dear
,
"
said
I
;
"
what
is
beauty
,
if
she
be
not
a
good
girl
?
<EOS>
Beauty
is
but
a
specious
,
and
,
<EOS>
as
it
may
happen
,
a
dangerous
recommendation
,
a
mere
skin
-
deep
perfection
;
and
if
,
as
she
grows
up
,
she
is
not
as
good
as
Miss
Goodwin
,
she
shall
be
none
of
my
girl
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
What
adds
to
my
pleasure
,
my
dear
friend
,
is
to
see
them
both
so
well
got
over
the
small
-
pox
.
<EOS>
It
has
been
as
happy
for
them
,
as
it
was
for
their
mamma
and
her
Billy
,
that
they
had
it
under
so
skilful
and
kind
a
manager
in
that
distemper
,
as
my
dear
mother
.
<EOS>
I
wish
if
it
please
God
,
it
was
as
happily
over
with
my
little
pretty
Frenchman
.
  
<EOS>
Every
body
is
surprised
to
see
what
the
past
two
years
have
done
for
Miss
Goodwin
and
my
Billy
.
 
<EOS>
O
,
my
dear
friend
,
they
are
both
of
them
almost
 
nay
,
quite
,
I
think
,
for
their
years
,
all
that
I
wish
them
to
be
.
<EOS>
In
order
to
make
them
keep
their
French
,
which
Miss
so
well
speaks
,
and
<EOS>
Billy
so
prettily
prattles
,
I
oblige
them
,
when
they
are
in
the
nursery
,
to
speak
nothing
else
:
but
at
table
,
except
on
particular
occasions
,
when
French
may
be
spoken
,
they
are
to
speak
in
English
;
that
is
,
when
they
do
speak
:
for
I
tell
them
,
that
little
masters
must
only
ask
questions
for
information
,
and
say
 
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
"
or
 
"
No
,
"
till
their
papas
or
mammas
permit
them
to
speak
;
nor
little
ladies
<EOS>
neither
,
till
they
are
sixteen
;
for
 
"
My
dear
loves
,
"
cry
I
,
"
you
would
not
speak
before
you
know
how
;
and
knowledge
is
obtained
by
hearing
,
and
not
by
speaking
.
"
<EOS>
And
setting
my
Billy
on
my
lap
,
in
Miss
's
presence
 
"
Here
,
"
said
I
,
taking
an
ear
in
the
fingers
of
each
hand
,
"
are
two
ears
,
my
Billy
,
"
and
then
,
pointing
to
his
mouth
,
"
but
one
tongue
,
my
love
;
<EOS>
so
you
must
be
sure
to
mind
that
you
hear
twice
as
much
as
you
speak
,
even
when
you
grow
a
bigger
master
than
you
are
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
so
many
pretty
ways
to
learn
one
,
Madam
,
"
says
Miss
,
now
<EOS>
and
then
,
"
that
it
is
impossible
<EOS>
we
should
not
regard
what
you
say
to
us
!
"
<EOS>
Several
French
tutors
,
when
we
were
abroad
,
were
recommended
to
Mr.
B.
<EOS>
But
there
is
one
English
gentleman
,
now
on
his
travels
with
young
Mr.
R.
with
whom
Mr.
B.
has
agreed
;
and
in
the
mean
time
,
my
best
friend
is
pleased
to
compliment
me
,
that
the
children
will
not
suffer
for
want
of
a
tutor
,
while
I
can
take
the
pains
I
do
:
which
he
will
have
to
be
too
much
for
me
:
<EOS>
especially
that
now
,
on
our
return
,
my
Davers
and
my
Pamela
are
added
to
my
cares
.
<EOS>
But
what
mother
can
take
too
much
pains
to
cultivate
the
minds
of
her
children
?
 
<EOS>
If
,
my
dear
Lady
G.
,
it
were
not
for
these
frequent
lyings
-
in
!
 
<EOS>
But
this
is
the
time
of
life
.
 
<EOS>
Though
little
did
I
think
,
so
early
,
I
should
have
so
many
careful
blessings
!
  
<EOS>
I
have
as
great
credit
as
pleasure
from
my
little
family
.
<EOS>
All
our
neighbours
here
admire
us
more
and
more
.
<EOS>
You
'll
excuse
my
seeming
(
for
it
is
but
seeming
)
<EOS>
vanity
<EOS>
:
I
hope
I
know
better
than
to
have
it
real
 
<EOS>
"
Never
,
"
says
Mrs.
Towers
,
who
is
still
a
single
lady
,
"
did
I
see
,
before
,
a
lady
so
much
advantaged
by
her
residence
in
that
fantastic
nation
"
(
for
she
loves
not
the
French
)
"
who
brought
home
with
her
nothing
of
their
affectation
!
"
 
<EOS>
She
says
,
that
the
French
politeness
,
and
the
English
frankness
and
plainness
of
heart
,
appear
happily
blended
in
all
we
say
and
do
.
<EOS>
And
she
makes
me
a
thousand
compliments
upon
Lord
and
Lady
Davers
's
account
,
<EOS>
who
,
she
would
fain
persuade
me
,
owe
a
great
deal
of
improvement
(
my
lord
in
his
conversation
,
and
my
lady
in
her
temper
)
to
living
in
the
same
house
with
us
.
  
<EOS>
My
Lady
Davers
is
exceeding
kind
and
good
to
me
,
is
always
magnifying
me
to
every
body
,
and
says
she
knows
not
how
to
live
from
me
:
and
that
I
have
been
a
means
of
saving
half
a
hundred
souls
,
as
well
as
her
dear
brother
's
.
<EOS>
On
an
indisposition
of
my
Lord
's
at
Montpellier
,
which
made
her
very
apprehensive
,
she
declared
,
that
were
she
to
be
deprived
of
his
lordship
,
she
would
not
let
us
rest
till
we
had
consented
to
her
living
with
us
;
saying
that
we
had
room
enough
in
Lincolnshire
,
and
she
would
enlarge
the
Bedfordshire
seat
at
her
own
expense
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
H.
is
Mr.
H.
still
;
and
that
's
the
best
I
can
say
of
him
;
for
I
verily
think
,
he
is
more
of
an
ape
than
ever
.
<EOS>
His
whole
head
is
now
French
.
'
<EOS>
Twas
half
so
before
.
<EOS>
We
had
great
difficulties
with
him
abroad
:
his
aunt
and
<EOS>
I
endeavouring
to
give
him
a
serious
and
religious
turn
,
we
had
like
to
have
turned
him
into
a
Roman
Catholic
.
<EOS>
For
he
was
much
pleased
with
the
shewy
part
of
that
religion
,
and
the
fine
pictures
,
and
decorations
in
the
churches
of
Italy
;
and
having
got
into
company
with
a
Dominican
at
Padua
,
a
Franciscan
at
Milan
,
and
a
Jesuit
at
Paris
,
they
lay
so
hard
at
him
,
in
their
turns
,
that
we
had
like
to
have
lost
him
to
each
assailant
:
so
were
forced
to
let
him
take
his
own
course
;
for
,
his
aunt
would
have
it
,
that
he
had
no
other
defence
from
the
attacks
of
persons
to
make
him
embrace
a
faulty
religion
,
than
to
permit
him
to
continue
as
he
was
;
that
is
to
say
,
to
have
none
at
all
.
<EOS>
So
she
suspended
attempting
to
proselyte
the
thoughtless
creature
,
till
he
came
to
England
.
<EOS>
I
wish
her
success
here
:
<EOS>
but
,
I
doubt
,
he
will
not
be
a
credit
to
any
religion
,
for
a
great
while
.
<EOS>
And
as
he
is
very
desirous
to
go
to
London
,
it
will
be
found
,
when
there
,
that
any
fluttering
coxcomb
will
do
more
to
make
him
one
of
that
class
,
in
an
hour
,
than
his
aunt
's
lessons
,
to
make
him
a
good
man
,
in
a
twelvemonth
.
<EOS>
"
Where
much
is
given
,
much
is
required
.
<EOS>
"
The
contrary
of
this
,
I
doubt
,
is
all
poor
Mr.
H.
has
to
trust
to
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
just
now
heard
that
his
father
,
who
has
been
long
ill
,
is
dead
.
<EOS>
So
now
,
he
is
a
lord
indeed
!
<EOS>
He
flutters
and
starts
about
most
strangely
,
I
warrant
,
and
is
wholly
employed
in
giving
directions
as
to
his
mourning
equipage
.
 
<EOS>
And
now
there
will
be
no
holding
him
in
,
<EOS>
I
doubt
;
except
his
new
title
has
so
much
virtue
in
it
,
as
to
make
him
a
wiser
and
better
man
.
  
<EOS>
He
will
now
have
a
seat
in
the
House
of
Peers
of
Great
Britain
;
but
I
hope
,
for
the
nation
's
sake
,
he
will
not
find
many
more
like
himself
there
!
 
<EOS>
For
,
to
me
,
that
is
one
of
the
most
venerable
assemblies
in
the
world
;
and
it
appears
the
more
so
,
since
I
have
been
abroad
;
for
an
English
gentleman
is
respected
,
if
he
be
any
thing
of
a
man
,
above
a
foreign
nobleman
;
and
an
English
nobleman
above
some
petty
sovereigns
.
  
<EOS>
If
our
travelling
gentry
duly
considered
this
distinction
in
their
favour
,
they
would
,
for
the
honour
of
their
country
,
as
well
as
for
their
own
credit
,
behave
in
a
better
manner
,
in
their
foreign
tours
,
than
,
I
am
sorry
to
say
,
some
of
them
do
.
<EOS>
But
what
can
one
expect
from
the
unlicked
cubs
(
pardon
the
term
)
sent
abroad
with
only
stature
,
to
make
them
look
like
men
,
and
equipage
to
attract
respect
,
without
one
other
qualification
to
enforce
it
?
  
<EOS>
Here
let
me
close
this
,
with
a
few
tears
,
to
the
memory
of
my
dear
Mrs.
Jervis
,
my
other
mother
,
my
friend
,
my
adviser
,
my
protectress
,
in
my
single
state
;
and
my
faithful
second
and
partaker
in
the
comforts
of
my
higher
life
,
and
better
fortunes
!
  
<EOS>
What
would
I
have
given
to
have
been
present
,
as
it
seems
,
she
so
earnestly
wished
,
to
close
her
dying
eyes
!
<EOS>
I
should
have
done
it
with
the
piety
and
the
concern
of
a
truly
affectionate
daughter
.
<EOS>
But
that
melancholy
happiness
was
denied
to
us
both
;
for
,
as
I
told
you
in
the
letter
on
the
occasion
,
the
dear
good
woman
(
who
is
now
in
the
possession
of
her
blessed
reward
,
and
rejoicing
in
God
's
mercies
)
was
no
more
,
when
the
news
reached
me
,
so
far
off
as
Heidelburgh
,
of
her
last
illness
and
wishes
.
  
<EOS>
I
can
not
forbear
,
every
time
I
enter
her
parlour
(
where
I
used
to
see
,
with
so
much
delight
,
the
good
woman
sitting
,
always
employed
in
some
useful
or
pious
work
)
,
shedding
a
tear
to
her
memory
;
and
in
my
Sabbath
duties
,
missing
her
,
I
miss
half
a
dozen
friends
,
methinks
;
and
I
sigh
in
remembrance
of
her
;
and
can
only
recover
that
cheerful
frame
,
which
the
performance
of
those
duties
always
gave
me
,
by
reflecting
,
that
she
is
now
reaping
the
reward
of
that
sincere
piety
,
which
used
to
edify
and
encourage
us
all
.
  
<EOS>
The
servants
we
brought
home
,
and
those
we
left
behind
,
melt
in
tears
at
the
name
of
Mrs.
Jervis
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Longman
,
too
,
lamented
the
loss
of
her
,
in
the
most
moving
strain
.
<EOS>
And
all
I
can
do
now
,
in
honour
of
her
memory
and
her
merit
,
is
to
be
a
friend
to
those
she
loved
most
,
as
I
have
already
begun
to
be
,
and
none
of
them
shall
suffer
in
those
concerns
that
can
be
answered
,
now
she
is
gone
.
<EOS>
For
the
loss
of
so
excellent
a
friend
and
relation
,
is
loss
enough
to
all
who
knew
her
,
and
claimed
kindred
with
her
.
  
<EOS>
Poor
worthy
Jonathan
,
too
,
(
'
tis
almost
a
misery
to
have
<EOS>
so
soft
,
so
susceptible
an
heart
as
I
have
,
or
to
have
such
good
servants
and
friends
as
one
can
not
lose
without
such
emotions
as
I
feel
for
the
loss
of
them
!
)
<EOS>
his
silver
hairs
,
which
I
have
beheld
with
so
much
delight
,
and
thought
I
had
a
father
in
presence
,
when
I
saw
them
adorning
so
honest
and
comely
a
face
,
are
now
laid
low
!
 
<EOS>
Forgive
me
,
he
was
not
a
common
servant
;
neither
are
any
of
ours
<EOS>
so
:
<EOS>
but
Jonathan
excelled
all
that
excelled
in
his
class!-I
am
told
,
that
these
two
worthy
folks
died
within
two
days
of
one
another
:
on
which
occasion
I
could
not
help
saying
to
myself
,
in
the
words
of
David
over
Saul
and
his
son
Jonathan
,
the
name
-
sake
of
our
worthy
butler
 
<EOS>
"
They
were
lovely
and
pleasant
in
their
lives
,
and
in
their
deaths
they
were
not
divided
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
might
have
continued
on
in
the
words
of
the
royal
lamenter
;
for
,
surely
,
never
did
one
fellow
-
servant
love
another
in
my
maiden
state
,
nor
servant
love
a
mistress
in
my
exalted
condition
,
better
than
Jonathan
loved
me
!
<EOS>
I
could
see
in
his
eyes
a
glistening
pleasure
,
whenever
I
passed
by
him
:
if
at
such
times
I
spoke
to
him
,
as
I
seldom
failed
to
do
,
with
a
 
<EOS>
"
God
bless
you
too
!
"
<EOS>
in
answer
to
his
repeated
blessings
,
he
had
a
kind
of
rejuvenescence
(
may
I
say
?
)
<EOS>
visibly
running
through
his
whole
frame
:
and
,
now
<EOS>
and
then
,
if
I
laid
my
hands
upon
his
folded
ones
,
as
I
passed
him
on
a
Sunday
morning
or
evening
,
praying
for
me
,
with
a
 
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
,
my
worthy
old
acquaintance
?
"
his
heart
would
spring
to
his
lips
in
a
kind
of
rapture
,
and
his
eyes
would
run
over
.
  
<EOS>
O
my
beloved
friend
!
<EOS>
how
the
loss
of
these
two
worthies
of
my
family
oppresses
me
at
times
!
  
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
likewise
shewed
a
generous
concern
on
the
occasion
:
and
when
all
the
servants
welcomed
us
in
a
body
,
on
our
return
 
"
Methinks
my
dear
,
"
said
he
,
"
I
miss
your
Mrs.
Jervis
,
and
honest
Jonathan
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
starting
tear
,
and
 
<EOS>
"
They
are
happy
,
dear
honest
souls
!
"
and
a
sigh
,
were
the
tribute
I
paid
to
their
memories
,
on
their
beloved
master
's
so
kindly
repeating
their
names
.
  
<EOS>
Who
knows
,
had
I
been
here
 
<EOS>
But
away
,
too
painful
reflections
 
<EOS>
They
lived
to
a
good
old
age
,
and
fell
like
fruit
fully
ripe
:
<EOS>
they
died
the
death
of
the
righteous
;
I
must
follow
them
in
time
,
God
knows
how
soon
;
and
,
Oh
!
<EOS>
that
my
latter
end
may
be
like
theirs
!
  
<EOS>
Once
more
,
forgive
me
,
my
dear
friend
,
this
small
tribute
to
their
memories
:
and
believe
,
that
I
am
not
so
ungrateful
for
God
's
mercies
,
as
to
let
the
loss
of
these
dear
good
folks
lessen
with
me
the
joy
and
delight
<EOS>
I
have
still
left
me
,
in
the
health
and
the
love
of
the
best
of
husbands
,
and
good
men
;
in
the
children
,
charming
as
ever
mother
could
boast
of
 
charming
,
I
mean
,
principally
,
in
the
dawning
beauties
of
their
minds
,
and
in
the
pleasure
their
towardliness
of
nature
gives
me
;
including
,
as
I
always
do
,
my
dear
Miss
Goodwin
,
and
have
reason
to
do
,
from
her
dutiful
love
of
me
,
and
observation
of
all
I
say
to
her
;
in
the
preservation
to
me
of
the
best
and
worthiest
of
parents
,
hearty
,
though
aged
as
they
are
;
in
the
love
and
friendship
of
good
Lord
and
Lady
Davers
,
and
my
excellent
friend
Lady
G.
;
not
forgetting
even
worthy
Mr.
Longman
.
<EOS>
God
preserve
all
these
to
me
,
as
I
am
truly
thankful
for
his
mercies
!
 
<EOS>
And
then
,
notwithstanding
my
affecting
losses
,
as
above
,
who
will
be
so
happy
as
I
?
<EOS>
That
you
,
my
dear
Lady
G.
may
long
continue
so
,
likewise
in
the
love
of
a
worthy
husband
,
and
the
delights
of
an
increasing
hopeful
family
,
which
will
make
you
some
amends
for
the
heavy
losses
you
also
have
sustained
,
in
the
two
last
years
of
an
affectionate
father
,
and
a
most
worthy
mother
,
and
,
in
Mrs.
Jones
,
of
a
good
neighbour
,
prays
your
ever
affectionate
friend
and
servant

MY
BELOVED
LADY
G.
,
  
<EOS>
You
will
excuse
my
long
silence
,
when
I
shall
tell
you
the
occasions
of
it
.
<EOS>
In
the
first
place
,
I
was
obliged
to
pay
a
dutiful
visit
to
Kent
,
where
my
good
father
was
taken
ill
of
a
fever
,
and
my
mother
of
an
ague
;
and
think
.
<EOS>
Madam
,
how
this
must
affect
me
,
at
their
time
of
life
!
  
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
kindly
accompanied
me
,
apprehending
that
his
presence
would
be
necessary
,
if
the
recovery
of
them
both
,
in
which
I
thankfully
rejoice
,
had
not
happened
;
<EOS>
especially
as
a
circumstance
I
am
,
I
think
,
always
in
,
added
more
weight
to
his
apprehensions
.
  
<EOS>
I
had
hardly
returned
from
Kent
to
Bedfordshire
,
and
looked
around
,
when
I
was
obliged
to
set
out
to
attend
Lady
Davers
,
who
said
she
should
die
,
if
she
saw
me
not
,
to
comfort
and
recover
,
by
my
counsel
and
presence
<EOS>
(
so
she
was
pleased
to
express
herself
)
<EOS>
her
sick
lord
who
had
just
got
out
of
an
intermittent
fever
,
which
left
him
without
any
spirit
,
and
was
occasioned
by
fretting
at
the
conduct
of
her
stupid
nephew
<EOS>
(
those
also
were
her
words
)
.
  
<EOS>
For
you
must
have
heard
(
every
body
hears
when
a
man
of
quality
does
a
foolish
thing
!
)
,
and
it
has
been
in
all
the
newspapers
,
that
,
"
On
Wednesday
last
the
Right
Honourable
John
"
<EOS>
(
Jackey
they
should
have
said
)
,
"
Lord
H.
,
nephew
to
the
Right
Honourable
William
Lord
Davers
,
was
married
to
the
Honourable
Mrs.
P.
,
relict
of
J.P.
of
Twickenham
,
Esq
.
,
a
lady
of
celebrated
beauty
and
ample
fortune
.
"
  
<EOS>
Now
,
you
must
know
,
that
this
celebrated
lady
is
,
'
tis
true
,
of
the
 
family
,
whence
her
title
of
honourable
;
but
is
indeed
so
celebrated
,
that
every
fluttering
coxcomb
in
town
can
give
some
account
of
her
,
even
before
she
was
in
keeping
of
the
Duke
of
 
who
had
cast
her
on
the
town
he
had
robbed
of
her
.
  
<EOS>
In
short
,
she
is
quite
a
common
woman
;
has
no
fortune
at
all
,
as
one
may
say
,
only
a
small
jointure
incumbered
;
and
is
much
in
debt
.
<EOS>
She
is
a
shrew
into
the
bargain
,
and
the
poor
wretch
is
a
father
already
;
for
he
has
already
had
a
girl
of
three
years
old
(
her
husband
has
been
dead
seven
)
<EOS>
brought
him
home
,
which
he
knew
nothing
of
,
nor
even
inquired
,
whether
his
widow
had
a
child
!
 
<EOS>
And
he
is
now
paying
the
mother
's
debts
,
and
trying
to
make
the
best
of
his
bargain
.
  
<EOS>
This
is
the
fruit
of
a
London
journey
,
so
long
desired
by
him
,
and
his
fluttering
about
there
with
his
new
title
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
drawn
in
by
a
brother
of
his
lady
,
and
a
friend
of
that
brother
's
,
two
town
sharpers
,
gamesters
,
and
bullies
.
<EOS>
Poor
Sir
Joseph
Wittol
!
<EOS>
This
was
his
case
,
and
his
character
,
it
seems
,
in
London
.
  
<EOS>
Shall
I
present
you
with
a
curiosity
?
<EOS>
"
Tis
a
copy
of
his
letter
to
his
uncle
,
who
had
,
as
you
may
well
think
,
lost
all
patience
with
him
,
on
occasion
of
this
abominable
folly
.

For

As

"
  
<EOS>
I
will
not
take
up
your
time
with
further
observations
upon
this
poor
creature
's
bad
conduct
:
his
reflection
must
proceed
from
feeling
;
and
will
,
that
's
the
worst
of
it
,
come
too
late
,
come
when
or
how
it
will
.
<EOS>
I
will
only
say
,
I
am
sorry
for
it
on
his
own
account
,
but
more
for
that
of
Lord
and
Lady
Davers
,
who
take
the
matter
very
heavily
,
and
wish
he
had
married
the
lowest
born
creature
in
England
<EOS>
(
so
she
had
been
honest
and
virtuous
)
,
rather
than
done
as
he
has
done
.
  
<EOS>
But
,
I
suppose
,
the
poor
gentleman
was
resolved
to
shun
,
at
all
adventures
,
Mr.
B.
's
fault
,
and
keep
up
to
the
pride
of
descent
and
family
;
 
and
so
married
the
only
creature
,
as
I
hope
(
since
it
can
not
be
helped
)
,
that
is
so
great
a
disgrace
to
both
:
for
I
presume
to
flatter
myself
,
for
the
sake
of
my
sex
,
that
,
among
the
poor
wretches
who
are
sunk
so
low
as
the
town
-
women
are
,
there
are
very
few
of
birth
or
education
;
but
such
,
principally
,
as
have
had
their
necessities
or
their
ignorance
taken
advantage
of
by
base
men
;
since
birth
and
education
must
needs
set
the
most
unhappy
of
the
sex
above
<EOS>
so
sordid
and
so
abandoned
a
guilt
,
<EOS>
as
the
hourly
wickedness
of
such
a
course
of
life
subjects
them
to
.
  
<EOS>
But
let
me
pursue
my
purpose
of
excusing
my
long
silence
.
<EOS>
I
had
hardly
returned
from
Lady
Davers
's
,
and
recovered
my
family
management
,
and
resumed
my
nursery
duties
,
when
my
fourth
dear
boy
,
my
Jemmy
(
for
,
I
think
am
I
going
on
to
make
out
the
number
Lady
Davers
allotted
me
)
,
pressed
so
upon
me
,
as
not
to
be
refused
,
for
one
month
or
six
weeks
close
attention
.
<EOS>
And
then
a
journey
to
Lord
Davers
's
,
and
that
noble
pair
accompanying
us
to
Kent
;
and
daily
and
hourly
pleasures
crowding
upon
us
,
narrow
and
confined
as
our
room
<EOS>
there
was
(
<EOS>
though
we
went
with
as
few
attendants
as
possible
)
,
engrossed
more
of
my
time
.
<EOS>
Thus
I
hope
you
will
forgive
me
,
because
,
as
soon
as
I
returned
,
I
set
about
writing
this
,
as
an
excuse
for
myself
,
in
the
first
place
;
to
promise
you
the
subject
you
insist
upon
,
in
the
next
;
and
to
say
,
that
I
am
incapable
of
forgetfulness
or
negligence
to
such
a
friend
as
Lady
G.
<EOS>
For
I
must
always
be
your
faithful
and
affectionate
humble
servant
,
P.B.
    
MY
DEAR
LADY
G.
,
  
<EOS>
The
remarks
,
your
cousin
Fielding
says
,
I
have
made
on
the
subject
of
young
gentlemen
's
travelling
,
and
which
you
request
me
to
communicate
to
you
,
are
part
of
a
little
book
upon
education
,
which
I
wrote
for
Mr.
B.
's
correction
and
amendment
,
on
his
putting
Mr.
Locke
's
treatise
on
that
subject
into
my
hands
,
and
requiring
my
observations
upon
it
.
  
<EOS>
I
can
not
flatter
myself
they
will
answer
your
expectation
;
for
I
am
sensible
they
must
be
unworthy
even
of
the
opportunities
I
have
had
in
the
excursions
,
in
which
I
have
been
indulged
by
the
best
of
men
.
<EOS>
But
your
requests
are
so
many
laws
to
me
;
and
I
will
give
you
a
short
abstract
of
what
I
read
Miss
Fielding
,
who
has
so
greatly
overrated
it
to
you
.
  
<EOS>
The
gentleman
's
book
contains
many
excellent
rules
on
education
;
but
this
of
travel
<EOS>
I
will
only
refer
you
to
at
present
.
<EOS>
You
will
there
see
his
objections
against
the
age
at
which
young
gentlemen
are
sent
abroad
,
from
sixteen
to
twenty
-
one
,
the
time
in
all
their
lives
,
he
says
,
at
which
young
gentlemen
are
the
least
suited
to
these
improvements
,
and
in
which
they
have
the
least
fence
and
guard
against
their
passions
.
  
<EOS>
The
age
he
proposes
is
from
seven
to
fourteen
,
because
of
the
advantage
they
will
then
have
to
master
foreign
languages
,
and
to
form
their
tongue
to
the
true
pronunciation
;
as
well
as
that
they
will
be
more
easily
directed
by
their
tutors
or
governors
.
<EOS>
Or
else
he
proposes
that
more
sedate
time
of
life
,
when
the
gentleman
is
able
to
travel
without
a
tutor
,
and
to
make
his
own
observations
;
and
when
he
is
thoroughly
acquainted
with
the
laws
and
fashions
,
the
natural
and
moral
advantages
and
defects
of
his
own
country
;
by
which
means
,
as
Mr.
Locke
wisely
observes
,
the
traveller
will
have
something
to
exchange
with
those
abroad
,
from
whose
conversation
he
hopes
to
reap
any
knowledge
.
<EOS>
And
he
supports
his
opinion
by
excellent
reasons
,
to
which
I
refer
you
.
  
<EOS>
What
I
have
written
in
my
little
book
,
not
yet
quite
finished
on
this
head
,
relates
principally
to
Home
Travelling
,
which
Mr.
B.
was
always
resolved
his
sons
should
undertake
,
before
they
entered
upon
a
foreign
tour
.
<EOS>
I
have
there
observed
,
that
England
abounds
with
curiosities
,
both
of
art
and
nature
,
worth
the
notice
of
a
diligent
inquirer
,
and
equal
with
some
of
those
we
admire
in
foreign
parts
;
and
that
if
the
youth
be
not
sent
abroad
at
Mr.
Locke
's
earliest
time
,
from
seven
to
fourteen
(
which
I
can
hardly
think
will
be
worth
while
,
merely
for
the
sake
of
attaining
a
perfection
in
the
languages
)
,
he
may
with
good
advantage
begin
,
at
fourteen
or
fifteen
,
the
tour
of
Great
Britain
,
now
-
and
-
then
,
by
excursions
,
in
the
summer
months
,
between
his
other
studies
,
and
as
a
diversion
to
him
.
<EOS>
This
I
should
wish
might
be
entered
upon
in
his
papa
's
company
,
as
well
as
his
tutor
's
,
if
it
could
conveniently
be
done
;
who
thus
initiating
both
the
governed
and
governor
in
the
methods
he
would
have
observed
by
both
,
will
obtain
no
small
satisfaction
and
amusement
to
himself
.
  
<EOS>
For
the
father
would
by
this
means
be
an
eye
-
witness
of
the
behaviour
of
the
one
and
the
other
,
and
have
a
specimen
how
fit
the
young
man
was
to
be
trusted
,
or
the
tutor
to
be
depended
upon
,
when
they
went
abroad
,
and
were
out
of
his
sight
:
as
they
would
of
what
was
expected
from
them
by
the
father
.
<EOS>
And
hence
a
thousand
benefits
may
arise
to
the
young
gentleman
from
the
occasional
observations
and
reflections
of
his
father
,
with
regard
to
expence
,
company
,
conversation
,
hours
,
and
such
like
.
  
<EOS>
If
the
father
could
not
himself
accompany
his
son
,
he
might
appoint
the
stages
the
young
gentleman
should
take
,
and
enjoin
both
tutor
and
son
to
give
,
at
every
stage
,
an
account
of
whatever
they
observed
curious
and
remarkable
,
not
omitting
the
minutest
occurrences
.
<EOS>
By
this
means
,
and
the
probability
that
he
might
hear
of
them
,
and
their
proceedings
,
from
his
friends
,
acquaintance
,
and
relations
,
who
might
fall
in
with
them
,
they
would
have
a
greater
regard
to
their
conduct
;
and
so
much
the
more
,
if
the
young
gentleman
were
to
keep
an
account
of
his
expences
,
which
,
upon
his
return
,
he
might
lay
before
his
father
.
  
<EOS>
By
seeing
thus
the
different
customs
,
manners
,
and
economy
of
different
persons
and
families
(
for
in
so
mixed
a
nation
as
ours
is
,
there
is
as
great
a
variety
of
that
sort
to
be
met
with
,
as
in
most
)
,
and
from
their
different
treatment
,
at
their
several
stages
,
a
great
deal
of
the
world
may
be
learned
by
the
young
gentleman
.
<EOS>
He
would
be
prepared
to
go
abroad
with
more
delight
to
himself
,
as
well
as
more
experience
,
and
greater
reputation
to
his
family
and
country
.
<EOS>
In
such
excursions
as
these
,
the
tutor
would
see
his
temper
and
inclination
,
and
might
notice
to
the
father
any
thing
amiss
,
that
it
might
be
set
right
,
while
the
youth
was
yet
in
his
reach
,
and
more
under
his
inspection
,
than
he
would
be
in
a
foreign
country
;
and
his
observations
,
on
his
return
,
as
well
as
in
his
letters
,
would
shew
how
fit
he
was
to
be
trusted
;
and
how
likely
to
improve
,
when
at
a
greater
distance
.
  
<EOS>
After
England
and
Wales
,
as
well
the
inland
parts
as
the
sea
-
coasts
,
let
them
if
they
behave
according
to
expectation
,
take
a
journey
into
Scotland
and
Ireland
,
and
visit
the
principal
islands
,
as
Guernsey
,
Jersey
,
&
c.
<EOS>
the
youth
continuing
to
write
down
his
observations
all
the
way
,
and
keeping
a
journal
of
occurrences
;
and
let
him
employ
the
little
time
he
will
be
on
board
of
ship
,
in
these
small
trips
from
island
to
island
,
or
coastwise
,
in
observing
upon
the
noble
art
of
navigation
;
of
the
theory
of
which
,
it
will
not
be
amiss
that
he
has
some
notion
,
as
well
as
of
the
curious
structure
of
a
ship
,
its
tackle
,
and
furniture
:
a
knowledge
very
far
from
being
insignificant
to
a
gentleman
who
is
an
islander
,
and
has
a
stake
in
the
greatest
maritime
kingdom
in
the
world
;
and
hence
he
will
be
taught
to
love
and
value
that
most
useful
and
brave
set
of
men
,
the
British
sailors
,
who
are
the
natural
defence
and
glory
of
the
realm
.
  
<EOS>
Hereby
he
will
confirm
his
theory
in
the
geography
of
the
British
dominions
in
Europe
,
he
will
be
apprised
of
the
situation
,
conveniences
,
interests
,
and
constitution
of
his
own
country
;
and
will
be
able
to
lay
a
ground
-
work
for
the
future
government
of
his
thoughts
and
actions
,
if
the
interest
he
bears
in
his
native
country
should
call
him
to
the
public
service
in
either
house
of
parliament
.
  
<EOS>
With
this
foundation
,
how
excellently
would
he
be
qualified
to
go
abroad
!
<EOS>
and
how
properly
then
would
he
add
to
the
knowledge
he
had
attained
of
his
own
country
,
that
of
the
different
customs
,
manners
,
and
forms
of
government
of
others
!
<EOS>
How
would
he
be
able
to
form
comparisons
,
and
to
make
all
his
inquiries
appear
pertinent
and
manly
.
<EOS>
All
the
occasions
of
that
ignorant
wonder
,
which
renders
a
novice
the
jest
of
all
about
him
,
would
be
taken
away
.
<EOS>
He
would
be
able
to
ask
questions
,
and
to
judge
without
leading
strings
.
<EOS>
Nor
would
he
think
he
has
seen
a
country
,
and
answered
the
ends
of
his
father
's
expence
,
and
his
own
improvement
,
by
running
through
a
kingdom
,
and
knowing
nothing
of
it
,
but
the
inns
and
stages
,
at
which
he
stopped
to
eat
and
drink
.
<EOS>
For
,
on
the
contrary
,
he
would
make
the
best
acquaintance
,
and
contract
worthy
friendships
with
such
as
would
court
and
reverence
him
as
one
of
the
rising
geniuses
of
his
country
.
  
<EOS>
Whereas
most
of
the
young
gentlemen
who
are
sent
abroad
raw
and
unprepared
,
as
if
to
wonder
at
every
thing
they
see
,
and
to
be
laughed
at
by
all
that
see
them
,
do
but
expose
themselves
and
their
country
.
<EOS>
And
if
,
at
their
return
,
by
interest
of
friends
,
by
alliances
,
or
marriages
,
they
should
happen
to
be
promoted
to
places
of
honour
or
profit
,
their
unmerited
preferment
will
only
serve
to
make
those
foreigners
,
who
were
eye
-
witnesses
of
their
weakness
and
follies
,
when
among
them
,
conclude
greatly
in
disfavour
of
the
whole
nation
,
or
,
at
least
,
of
the
prince
,
and
his
administration
,
who
could
find
no
fitter
subjects
to
distinguish
.
  
<EOS>
This
,
my
dear
friend
,
is
a
brief
extract
from
my
observations
on
the
head
of
qualifying
young
gentlemen
to
travel
with
honour
and
improvement
.
<EOS>
I
doubt
you
'll
be
apt
to
think
me
not
a
little
out
of
my
element
;
but
since
you
would
have
it
,
I
claim
the
allowances
of
a
friend
;
to
which
my
ready
compliance
with
your
commands
the
rather
entitles
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
am
very
sorry
<EOS>
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Murray
are
so
unhappy
in
each
other
.
<EOS>
Were
he
a
generous
man
,
the
heavy
loss
the
poor
lady
has
sustained
,
as
well
as
her
sister
,
my
beloved
friend
,
in
so
excellent
a
mother
,
and
so
kind
a
father
,
would
make
him
bear
with
her
infirmities
a
little
.
  
<EOS>
But
,
really
,
I
have
seen
,
on
twenty
occasions
,
that
notwithstanding
all
the
fine
things
gentlemen
say
to
ladies
before
marriage
,
if
the
latter
do
not
improve
upon
their
husbands
'
hands
,
their
imputed
graces
when
single
,
will
not
protect
them
from
indifference
,
and
,
probably
,
from
worse
;
while
the
gentleman
,
perhaps
,
thinks
he
only
,
of
the
two
,
is
entitled
to
go
backward
in
acts
of
kindness
and
complaisance
.
<EOS>
A
strange
and
shocking
difference
which
too
many
ladies
experience
,
who
,
from
fond
lovers
,
prostrate
at
their
feet
,
find
surly
husbands
,
trampling
upon
their
necks
!
  
<EOS>
You
,
my
dear
friend
,
were
happy
in
your
days
of
courtship
,
and
are
no
less
so
in
your
state
of
wedlock
.
<EOS>
And
may
you
continue
to
be
so
to
a
good
old
age
,
prays
your
affectionate
and
faithful
friend
,
<EOS>
P.B.
    
My
dear
Lady
G.
,
  
<EOS>
I
will
cheerfully
cause
to
be
transcribed
for
you
the
conversation
you
desire
,
between
myself
,
Mrs.
Towers
,
and
Lady
Arthur
,
and
the
three
young
ladies
their
relations
,
in
presence
of
the
dean
and
his
daughter
,
and
Mrs.
Brooks
;
and
glad
I
shall
be
,
if
it
may
be
of
use
to
the
two
thoughtless
<EOS>
Misses
your
neighbours
;
who
,
you
are
pleased
to
tell
me
,
are
great
admirers
of
my
story
and
my
example
;
and
will
therefore
,
as
you
say
,
pay
greater
attention
to
what
I
write
,
than
to
the
more
passionate
and
interested
lessons
of
their
mamma
.
  
<EOS>
I
am
only
sorry
you
should
be
concerned
about
the
supposed
trouble
you
give
me
,
by
having
mislaid
my
former
relation
of
it
.
<EOS>
For
,
besides
obliging
my
dear
Lady
G.
,
the
hope
of
doing
service
by
it
to
a
family
so
worthy
,
in
a
case
so
nearly
affecting
its
honour
,
as
to
make
two
headstrong
young
ladies
recollect
what
belongs
to
their
sex
and
their
characters
,
and
what
their
filial
duties
require
of
them
,
affords
me
high
pleasure
;
and
if
it
shall
be
attended
with
the
wished
effects
,
it
will
add
to
my
happiness
.
  
<EOS>
I
said
,
cause
to
be
transcribed
,
because
I
hope
to
answer
a
double
end
by
it
;
for
,
on
reconsideration
,
I
set
Miss
Goodwin
to
transcribe
it
,
who
writes
a
pretty
hand
,
and
is
not
a
little
fond
of
the
task
,
nor
,
indeed
,
of
any
task
I
set
her
;
and
will
be
more
affected
as
she
performs
it
,
than
she
could
be
by
reading
it
only
;
although
she
is
a
very
good
girl
at
present
,
and
gives
me
hopes
that
she
will
continue
to
be
so
.
  
<EOS>
I
will
inclose
it
when
done
,
that
it
may
be
read
to
the
parties
without
this
introduction
,
if
you
think
fit
.
<EOS>
And
you
will
forgive
me
for
having
added
a
few
observations
,
with
a
view
to
the
cases
of
your
inconsiderate
young
ladies
,
and
for
having
corrected
the
former
narrative
in
several
places
.
  
<EOS>
My
dear
Lady
G.
,
  
<EOS>
The
papers
you
have
mislaid
,
as
to
the
conversation
between
me
and
the
young
ladies
,
relations
of
Mrs.
Towers
,
and
Lady
Anne
Arthur
,
in
presence
of
these
two
last
-
named
ladies
,
Mrs.
Brooks
,
and
the
worthy
dean
,
and
Miss
L.
(
of
which
,
in
order
to
perfect
your
kind
collection
of
my
communications
you
request
another
copy
)
contained
as
follows
.
  
<EOS>
I
first
stated
,
that
I
had
seen
these
three
ladies
twice
or
thrice
before
,
as
visitors
,
at
their
kinswomen
's
houses
so
that
they
and
I
were
not
altogether
strangers
to
one
another
:
and
my
two
neighbours
acquainted
me
with
their
respective
tastes
and
dispositions
,
and
their
histories
preparatory
to
this
visit
,
to
the
following
effects
:
  
That
MISS
STAPYLTON
is
over
-
run
with
the
love
of
poetry
and
romance
,
and
delights
in
flowery
language
and
metaphorical
flourishes
:
is
about
eighteen
,
wants
not
either
sense
or
politeness
;
and
has
read
herself
into
a
vein
,
more
amorous
(
that
was
Mrs.
Towers
's
word
)
than
discreet
.
<EOS>
Has
extraordinary
notions
of
a
first
sight
love
;
and
gives
herself
greater
liberties
,
with
a
pair
of
fine
eyes
(
in
hopes
to
make
sudden
conquests
in
pursuance
of
that

is
pretty
in
her
sex
and
age

which
makes
those
who
know
her
not
,
conclude
her
bold
and
forward
;
and
is
more
than
suspected
,
with
a
mind
thus
prepared
for
instantaneous
impressions
,
to
have
experienced
the
argument
to
her
own
disadvantage
,
and
to
be
struck
by
(
before
she
had
stricken
)
a
gentleman
,
whom
her
friends
think
not
at
all
worthy
of
her
,
and
to
whom
she
was
making
some
indiscreet
advances
,
under
the
name
of
PHILOCLEA
to
PHILOXENUS
,
in
a
letter
which
she
entrusted
to
a
servant
of
the
family
,
who
,
discovering
her
design
,
prevented
her
indiscretion
for
that
time
.
  
<EOS>
That
,
in
other
respects
,
she
has
no
mean
accomplishments
,
will
have
a
fine
fortune
,
is
genteel
in
her
person
,
though
with
some
visible
affectation
,
dances
well
,
sings
well
,
and
plays
prettily
on
several
instruments
;
is
fond
of
reading
,
but
affects
the
action
,
and
air
,
and
attitude
of
a
tragedian
;
and
is
too
apt
to
give
an
emphasis
in
the
wrong
place
,
in
order
to
make
an
author
mean
significantly
,
even
where
the
occasion
is
common
,
and
,
in
a
mere
historical
fact
,
that
requires
as
much
simplicity
in
the
reader
's
accent
,
as
in
the
writer
's
style
.
<EOS>
No
wonder
then
,
that
when
she
reads
a
play
,
she
will
put
herself
into
a
sweat
,
as
Mrs.
Towers
says
;
distorting
very
agreeable
features
,
and
making
a
multitude
of
wry
mouths
with
one
very
pretty
one
,
in
order
to
convince
her
hearers
,
what
a
near
neighbour
her
heart
is
to
her

MISS
COPE
is
a
young
lady
of
nineteen
,
lovely
in
her
person
,
with
a
handsome
fortune
in
possession
,
and
great
prospects
.
<EOS>
Has
a
soft
and
gentle
turn
of
mind
,
which
disposes
her
to
be
easily
imposed
upon
.
<EOS>
Is
addressed
by
a
libertine
of
quality
,
whose
courtship
,
while
permitted
,
was
imperiousness
;
and
whose
tenderness
,
insult
:
having
found
the
young
lady
too
susceptible
of
impression
,
open
and
unreserved
,
and
even
valuing
him
the
more
,
as
it
seemed
,
for
treating
her
with
ungenerous
contempt
;
for
that
she
was
always
making
excuses
for
slights
,
ill
manners
,
and
even
rudeness
,
which
no
other
young
lady
would
forgive
.
  
<EOS>
That
this
docility
on
her
side
,
and
this
insolence
on
his
,
and
an
over
-
free
,
and
even
indecent
degree
of
romping
,
as
it
is
called
,
with
her
,
which
once
her
mamma
surprised
them
in
,
made
her
papa
forbid
his
visits
,
and
her
receiving
them
.
  
<EOS>
That
this
however
,
was
so
much
to
Miss
Cope
's
regret
,
that
she
was
detected
in
a
design
to
elope
to
him
out
of
the
private
garden
-
door
;
which
,
had
she
effected
,
in
all
probability
,
the
indelicate
and
dishonourable
peer
would
have
triumphed
over
her
innocence
;
having
given
out
since
,
that
he
intended
to
revenge
himself
on
the
daughter
,
for
the
disgrace
he
had
received
from
the
parents
.
  
<EOS>
That
though
convinced
of
this
,
it
was
feared
she
still
loved
him
,
and
would
again
throw
herself
in
his
way
;
urging
,
that
his
rash
expressions
were
the
effect
only
of
his
passion
;
for
that
she
knows
he
loves
her
too
well
to
be
dishonourable
to
her
;
and
by
the
same
degree
of
favourable
prepossession
,
she
will
have
it
,
that
his
brutal
roughness
is
the
manliness
of
his
nature
;
that
his
most
shocking
expressions
are
sincerity
of
heart
;
that
his
boasts
of
former
lewdness
are
but
instances
that
he
knows
the
world
;
that
his
freedoms
with
her
person
are
but
excess
of
love
and
innocent
gaiety
of
temper
;
that
his
resenting
the
prohibition
he
has
met
with
,
and
his
threats
,
are
other
instances
of
his
love
and
his
courage
:
and
peers
of
the
realm
ought
not
to
be
bound
down
by
little
narrow
rules
like
the
vulgar
;
for
,
truly
,
their
honour
is
in
the
greatest
cases
regarded
as
equal
with
the
oath
of
a
common
gentleman
,
and
is
a
security
that
a
lady
may
trust
to
,
if
he
is
not
a
profligate
indeed
;
and
that
Lord
P.
can
not
be
.
  
<EOS>
That
excepting
these
weaknesses
,
Miss
has
many
good
qualities
;
is
charitable
,
pious
,
humane
,
humble
;
sings
sweetly
,
plays
on
the
spinnet
charmingly
;
is
meek
,
fearful
,
and
never
was
resolute
or
courageous
enough
to
step
out
of
the
regular
path
,
till
her
too
flexible
heart
became
touched
with
a
passion
,
that
is
said
to
polish
the
most
brutal
temper
,
and
therefore
her
rough
peer
has
none
of
it
;
and
to
animate
the
dove
,
of
which
Miss
Cope
has
too
much
.
  
<EOS>
That
Miss
Sutton
,
a
young
lady
of
the
like
age
with
the
two
former
,
has
too
lively
and
airy
a
turn
of
mind
;
affects
to
be
thought
well
read
in
the
histories
of
kingdoms
,
as
well
as
in
polite
literature
.
<EOS>
Speaks
French
fluently
,
talks
much
upon
all
subjects
;
and
has
a
great
deal
of
flippant
wit
,
which
makes
more
enemies
than
friends
.
<EOS>
However
,
is
innocent
,
and
unsuspectedly
virtuous
hitherto
;
but
makes
herself
cheap
and
accessible
to
fops
and
rakes
,
and
has
not
the
worse
opinion
of
a
man
for
being
such
.
<EOS>
Listens
eagerly
to
stories
told
to
the
disadvantage
of
some
of
her
own
sex
;
though
affecting
to
be
a
great
stickler
for
the
honour
of
it
in
general
:
will
unpityingly
propagate
them
:
thinks
(
without
considering
to
what
the
imprudence
of
her
own
conduct
may
subject
her
)
<EOS>
the
woman
that
slips
inexcusable
;
and
the
man
who
seduces
her
,
much
less
faulty
;
and
thus
encourages
the
one
sex
in
their
vileness
,
and
gives
up
the
other
for
their
weakness
,
in
a
kind
of
silly
affectation
,
to
shew
her
security
in
her
own
virtue
;
at
the
same
time
,
that
she
is
dancing
upon
the
edge
of
a
precipice
,
presumptuously
inattentive
to
her
own
danger
.
  
<EOS>
The
worthy
dean
,
knowing
the
ladies
'
intention
in
this
visit
to
me
,
brought
his
daughter
with
him
,
as
if
by
accident
;
for
Miss
L.
with
many
good
qualities
,
is
of
a
remarkable
soft
temper
,
though
not
so
inconsiderately
soft
as
Miss
Cope
:
but
is
too
credulous
;
and
,
as
her
papa
suspects
,
entertains
more
than
a
liking
to
a
wild
young
gentleman
,
the
heir
to
a
noble
fortune
,
who
makes
visits
to
her
,
full
of
tenderness
and
respect
,
but
without
declaring
himself
.
<EOS>
This
gives
the
dean
much
uneasiness
;
and
he
is
very
desirous
that
his
daughter
should
be
in
my
company
on
all
occasions
,
as
she
is
so
kind
to
profess
a
great
regard
to
my
opinion
and
judgment
.
  
<EOS>
@@@Tis
easy
to
see
the
poor
young
lady
is
in
love
;
and
she
makes
no
doubt
that
the
young
gentleman
loves
her
;
but
,
alas
!
<EOS>
why
then
(
for
he
is
not
a
bashful
man
,
as
you
shall
hear
)
does
he
not
say
so
?
 
<EOS>
He
has
deceived
already
two
young
creatures
.
<EOS>
His
father
has
cautioned
the
dean
against
his
son
.
<EOS>
Has
told
him
,
that
he
is
sly
,
subtle
,
full
of
stratagem
,
yet
has
so
much
command
of
himself
(
which
makes
him
more
dangerous
)
,
as
not
to
precipitate
his
designs
;
but
can
wait
with
patience
till
he
thinks
himself
secure
of
his
prey
,
and
then
pulls
off
the
mask
at
once
;
and
,
if
he
succeeds
,
glories
in
his
villainy
.
<EOS>
Yet
does
his
father
beg
of
the
dean
to
permit
his
visits
,
for
he
wishes
him
to
marry
Miss
L.
though
greatly
unequal
in
fortune
to
his
son
,
wishing
for
nothing
so
much
as
that
he
would
marry
.
<EOS>
And
the
dean
,
owing
his
principal
preferment
to
the
old
gentleman
,
cares
not
to
disoblige
him
,
or
affront
his
son
,
without
some
apparent
reason
for
it
,
especially
as
the
father
is
wrapt
up
in
him
,
having
no
other
child
,
and
being
himself
half
afraid
of
him
,
least
,
if
too
much
thwarted
,
he
should
fly
out
entirely
.
  
<EOS>
So
here
,
Madam
,
are
four
young
ladies
of
like
years
,
and
different
inclinations
and
tempers
,
all
of
whom
may
be
said
to
have
dangers
to
encounter
,
resulting
from
their
respective
dispositions
:
and
who
,
professing
to
admire
my
character
and
example
,
were
brought
to
me
,
to
be
benefited
,
as
Mrs.
Towers
was
pleased
to
say
,
by
my
conversation
:
and
all
was
to
be
as
if
accidental
,
none
of
them
knowing
how
well
I
was
acquainted
with
their
several
characters
.
  
<EOS>
How
proud
would
this
compliment
have
made
me
from
such
a
lady
as
Mrs.
Towers
,
had
I
not
been
as
proud
as
proud
could
be
before
,
of
the
good
opinion
of
four
beloved
persons
,
Mr.
B.
,
Lady
Davers
,
the
Countess
of
C.
and
your
dear
self
.
  
<EOS>
We
were
attended
only
by
Polly
Barlow
,
who
in
some
points
was
as
much
concerned
as
any
body
.
<EOS>
And
this
being
when
Lord
and
Lady
Davers
,
and
the
noble
Countess
,
were
with
us
,
'
tis
proper
to
say
,
they
were
abroad
together
upon
a
visit
,
from
which
,
knowing
how
I
was
to
be
engaged
,
they
excused
me
.
<EOS>
The
dean
was
well
known
to
,
and
valued
by
,
all
the
ladies
;
and
therefore
was
no
manner
of
restraint
upon
the
freedom
of
our
conversation
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
in
my
closet
when
they
came
;
and
Mrs.
Towers
,
having
presented
each
young
lady
to
me
when
I
came
down
,
said
,
being
all
seated
,
"
I
can
guess
at
your
employment
,
Mrs.
B.
Writing
,
I
dare
say
?
<EOS>
I
have
often
wished
to
have
you
for
a
correspondent
;
for
every
one
who
can
boast
of
that
favour
,
exalts
you
to
the
skies
,
and
says
,
your
letters
exceed
your
conversation
,
but
I
always
insisted
upon
it
that
that
was
impossible
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Towers
,
"
said
I
,
"
is
always
saying
the
most
obliging
things
in
the
world
of
her
neighbours
:
but
may
not
one
suffer
,
dear
Madam
,
for
these
kind
prepossessions
,
in
the
opinion
of
greater
strangers
,
who
will
judge
more
impartially
than
your
favour
will
permit
you
to
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
,
"
said
Lady
Arthur
,
"
will
be
so
soon
put
out
of
doubt
,
when
Mrs.
B.
begins
to
speak
,
that
we
will
refer
to
that
,
and
to
put
an
end
to
every
thing
that
looks
like
compliment
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
Mrs.
B.
,
"
says
Mrs.
Towers
,
"
may
one
ask
,
what
particular
subject
was
at
this
time
your
employment
?
"
  
<EOS>
I
had
been
writing
(
you
must
know
,
Lady
G.
)
for
the
sake
of
suiting
Miss
Stapylton
's
flighty
vein
,
a
little
sketch
of
the
style
she
is
so
fond
of
;
and
hoped
for
some
such
opportunity
as
this
question
gave
me
,
to
bring
it
on
the
carpet
;
for
my
only
fear
,
with
her
and
Miss
Cope
,
and
Miss
Sutton
,
was
,
that
they
would
deem
me
too
grave
;
and
so
what
should
fall
in
the
course
of
conversation
,
would
make
the
least
impression
upon
them
.
<EOS>
For
the
best
instructions
,
you
know
,
will
be
ineffectual
,
if
the
manner
of
conveying
them
is
not
adapted
to
the
taste
and
temper
of
the
person
you
would
wish
to
influence
.
<EOS>
And
moreover
,
I
had
a
view
in
it
,
to
make
this
little
sketch
the
introduction
to
some
future
observations
on
the
stiff
and
affected
style
of
romances
,
which
might
put
Miss
Stapylton
out
of
conceit
with
them
,
and
make
her
turn
the
course
of
her
studies
another
way
,
as
I
shall
mention
in
its
place
.
  
<EOS>
I
answered
that
I
had
been
meditating
upon
the
misfortunes
of
a
fine
young
lady
,
who
had
been
seduced
and
betrayed
by
a
gentleman
she
loved
,
and
who
,
notwithstanding
,
had
the
grace
to
stop
short
(
indeed
,
later
than
were
to
be
wished
)
,
and
to
abandon
friends
,
country
,
lover
,
in
order
to
avoid
any
further
intercourse
with
him
;
and
that
God
had
blessed
her
penitence
and
resolution
,
and
she
was
now
very
happy
in
a
neighbouring
dominion
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
fine
subject
,
"
said
Miss
Stapylton
.
<EOS>
"
Was
the
gentleman
a
man
of
wit
,
Madam
?
<EOS>
Was
the
lady
a
woman
of
taste
?
<EOS>
"
we
condemn
every
man
who
dresses
well
,
and
is
not
a
sloven
,
as
a
fop
or
a
coxcomb
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
No
doubt
,
when
this
is
the
case
.
<EOS>
But
you
hardly
ever
saw
a
man
very
nice
about
his
person
and
dress
,
that
had
any
thing
he
thought
of
greater
consequence
to
himself
to
regard
.
'
<EOS>
Tis
natural
it
should
be
so
;
for
should
not
the
man
of
body
take
the
greater
care
to
set
out
and
adorn
the
part
for
which
he
thinks
himself
most
valuable
?
<EOS>
And
will
not
the
man
of
mind
bestow
his
principal
care
in
improving
that
mind
?
<EOS>
perhaps
to
the
neglect
of
dress
,
and
outward
appearance
,
which
is
a
fault
.
<EOS>
But
surely
,
Madam
,
there
is
a
middle
way
to
be
observed
,
in
these
,
as
in
most
other
cases
;
for
a
man
need
not
be
a
sloven
,
any
more
than
a
fop
.
<EOS>
He
need
not
shew
an
utter
disregard
to
dress
,
nor
yet
think
it
his
first
and
chief
concern
;
be
ready
to
quarrel
with
the
wind
for
discomposing
his
peruke
,
or
fear
to
put
on
his
hat
,
lest
he
should
depress
his
foretop
;
more
dislike
a
spot
upon
his
clothes
,
than
in
his
reputation
;
be
a
self
-
admirer
,
and
always
at
the
glass
,
which
he
would
perhaps
never
look
into
,
<EOS>
could
it
shew
him
<EOS>
the
deformity
of
his
mind
,
as
well
as
the
finery
of
his
person
;
who
has
a
taylor
for
his
tutor
,
and
a
milliner
for
his
school
-
mistress
;
who
laughs
at
men
of
sense
(
excusably
enough
,
perhaps
in
revenge
because
they
laugh
at
him
)
;
who
calls
learning
pedantry
,
and
looks
upon
the
knowledge
of
the
fashions
as
the
only
useful
science
to
a
fine

Pardon
me
,
ladies
<EOS>
;
I
could
proceed
with
the
character
of
this
species
of
men
,
but
I
need
not
;
for
every
lady
present
would
despise
such
an
one
,
as
much
as
I
do
,
were
he
to
fall
in
her
way
:
or
the
rather
,
because
he
who
admires
himself
,
will
never
admire
his
lady
as
he
ought
;
and
if
he
maintains
his
niceness
after
marriage
,
it
will
be
with
a
preference
to
his
own
person
;
if
not
,
will
sink
,
very
probably
,
into
the
worst
of
slovens
.
<EOS>
For
whoever
is
capable
of
one
extreme
(
take
almost
the
cases
of
human
life
through
)
when
he
recedes
from
that
,
if
he
be
not
a
man
of
prudence
,
will
go
over
into
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
to
return
to
the
former
subject
"
(
for
the
general
attention
encouraged
me
to
proceed
)
,
"
permit
me
,
Miss
Sutton
,
to
add
,
that
a
lady
must
run
great
risks
to
her
reputation
,
if
not
to
her
virtue
,
who
will
admit
into
her
company
any
gentleman
who
shall
be
of
opinion
,
and
know
it
to
be
hers
,
that
it
is
his
province
to
ask
a
favour
,
which
it
will
be
her
duty
to
deny
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
,
Madam
,
I
spoke
these
words
a
little
too
carelessly
;
but
I
meant
honourable
questions
,
to
be
sure
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
can
be
but
one
honourable
question
,
"
replied
I
;
"
and
that
is
seldom
asked
,
but
when
the
affair
is
brought
near
a
conclusion
,
and
there
is
a
probability
of
its
being
granted
;
and
which
a
single
lady
,
while
she
has
parents
or
guardians
,
should
never
think
of
permitting
to
be
put
to
herself
,
much
less
of
approving
,
nor
,
perhaps
,
as
the
case
may
be
of
denying
.
<EOS>
But
I
make
no
doubt
that
you
meant
honourable
questions
.
<EOS>
A
young
lady
of
Miss
Sutton
's
good
sense
,
and
worthy
character
,
could
not
mean
otherwise
.
<EOS>
And
I
have
said
,
perhaps
,
more
than
I
need
upon
the
subject
,
because
we
all
know
how
ready
the
presuming
of
the
other
sex
are
,
right
or
wrong
to
construe
the
most
innocent
meetings
in
favour
of
their
own
views
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
true
,
"
said
she
;
but
appeared
to
be
under
an
agreeable
confusion
,
every
lady
,
by
her
eye
,
seeming
to
think
she
had
met
with
a
deserved
rebuke
;
and
which
not
seeming
to
expect
,
it
abated
her
liveliness
all
the
time
after
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Towers
seasonably
relieved
us
both
from
a
subject
too
applicable
,
if
I
may
so
express
it
,
saying
 
"
<EOS>
But
,
dear
Mrs.
B.
,
will
you
favour
us
with
the
result
of
your
meditation
,
if
committed
to
writing
,
on
the
unhappy
case
you
mentioned
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
rather
.
<EOS>
Madam
,
exercising
my
fancy
than
my
judgment
,
such
as
it
is
,
upon
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
I
was
aiming
at
a
kind
of
allegorical
or
metaphorical
style
,
I
know
not
which
to
call
it
;
and
it
is
not
fit
to
be
read
before
such
judges
,
I
doubt
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
O
pray
,
dear
Madam
,
"
said
Miss
Stapylton
,
"
favour
us
with
it
to
choose
;
for
I
am
a
great
admirer
of
that
style
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
a
great
curiosity
,
"
said
Lady
Arthur
,
"
both
from
the
subject
and
the
style
,
to
hear
what
you
have
written
:
and
I
beg
you
will
oblige
us
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
short
and
unfinished
.
<EOS>
It
was
written
for
the
sake
of
a
friend
,
who
is
fond
of
such
a
style
;
and
what
I
shall
add
to
it
,
will
be
principally
some
slight
observations
upon
this
way
of
writing
.
<EOS>
But
,
let
it
be
ever
so
censurable
,
I
should
be
more
so
,
if
I
made
any
difficulties
after
such
an
unanimous
request
.
"
<EOS>
So
,
taking
it
out
of
my
letter
-
case
,
I
read
as
follows
:
  
<EOS>
"
While
the
banks
of
discretion
keep
the
proud
water
of
passion
within
their
natural
channel
,
all
calm
and
serene
glides
along
the
silver
current
,
enlivening
the
adjacent
meadows
,
as
it
passes
,
with
a
brighter
and
more
flowery
verdure
.
<EOS>
But
if
the
torrents
of
sensual
love
are
permitted
to
descend
from
the
hills
of
credulous
hope
,
they
may
so
swell
the
gentle
stream
,
as
to
make
it
difficult
,
if
not
impossible
,
to
be
retained
betwixt
its
usual
bounds
.
<EOS>
What
then
will
be
the
consequence
?
 
<EOS>
Why
,
the
trees
of
resolution
,
and
the
shrubs
of
cautious
fear
,
which
grew
upon
the
frail
mound
,
and
whose
intertwining
roots
had
contributed
to
support
it
,
being
loosened
from
their
hold
,
they
,
and
all
that
would
swim
of
the
bank
itself
,
will
be
seen
floating
on
the
surface
of
the
triumphant
waters
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
here
,
a
dear
lady
,
having
unhappily
failed
,
is
enabled
to
set
her
foot
in
the
new
-
made
breach
,
while
yet
it
is
possible
to
stop
it
,
and
to
say
,
with
little
variation
in
the
language
of
that
power
,
which
only
could
enable
her
to
say
it
.
<EOS>
Hither
,
ye
proud
waves
of
dissolute
love
,
although
you
HAVE
come
,
yet
no
farther
SHALL
ye
come
;
is
such
an
instance
of
magnanimous
resolution
and
self
-
conquest
,
as
is
very
rarely
to
be
met
with
.
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Stapylton
seemed
pleased
(
as
I
expected
)
,
and
told
me
,
that
she
should
take
it
for
a
high
favour
,
to
be
permitted
,
if
not
improper
,
to
see
the
whole
letter
when
finished
.
  
<EOS>
I
said
,
I
would
oblige
her
with
all
my
heart
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
you
must
not
expect
,
Madam
,
that
although
I
have
written
what
I
have
read
to
you
,
I
shall
approve
of
it
in
my
observations
upon
it
;
for
I
am
convinced
,
that
no
style
can
be
proper
,
which
is
not
plain
,
simple
,
easy
,
natural
and
unaffected
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
was
sure
,
she
was
pleased
to
say
,
that
whatever
my
observations
were
,
they
would
be
equally
just
and
instructive
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
too
,
"
said
the
dean
,
"
will
answer
for
that
;
for
I
dare
say
,
by
what
I
have
already
heard
,
that
Mrs.
B.
will
distinguish
properly
between
the
style
(
and
the
matter
too
)
which
captivates
the
imagination
,
and
that
which
informs
the
judgment
.
"
  
<EOS>
Our
conversation
,
after
this
,
took
a
more
general
turn
;
which
I
thought
right
,
lest
the
young
ladies
should
imagine
it
was
a
designed
thing
against
them
:
yet
it
was
such
,
that
every
one
of
them
found
her
character
and
taste
,
little
or
much
,
concerned
in
it
;
and
all
seemed
,
as
Mrs.
Towers
afterwards
observed
to
me
,
by
their
silence
and
attention
,
to
be
busied
in
private
applications
.
  
<EOS>
The
dean
began
it
with
a
high
compliment
to
me
;
having
a
view
,
no
doubt
,
by
his
kind
praises
,
to
make
my
observations
have
the
greater
weight
upon
the
young
ladies
.
<EOS>
He
said
,
it
was
matter
of
great
surprise
to
him
,
that
,
my
tender
years
considered
,
I
should
be
capable
of
making
those
reflections
,
by
which
persons
of
twice
my
age
and
experience
might
be
instructed
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
Madam
,
"
said
he
,
"
our
attention
,
when
your
lips
begin
to
open
;
and
<EOS>
I
beg
we
may
have
nothing
to
do
,
but
to
be
attentive
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
had
such
advantages
,
Sir
,
from
the
observations
and
cautions
of
my
late
excellent
lady
,
that
did
you
but
know
half
of
them
,
you
would
rather
wonder
I
had
made
no
greater
improvement
,
than
that
I
have
made
so
much
.
<EOS>
She
used
to
think
me
pretty
,
and
not
ill
-
tempered
,
and
,
of
course
not
incredulous
,
where
I
conceived
a
good
opinion
;
and
was
always
arming
me
on
that
side
,
as
believing
I
might
be
the
object
of
wicked
attempts
,
and
the
rather
,
as
my
low
fortune
subjected
me
to
danger
.
<EOS>
For
,
had
I
been
born
to
rank
and
condition
,
as
these
young
ladies
here
,
I
should
have
had
reason
to
think
of
myself
,
as
justly
as
,
no
doubt
,
they
do
,
and
,
of
consequence
,
beyond
the
reach
of
any
vile
intriguer
;
as
I
should
have
been
above
the
greatest
part
of
that
species
of
mankind
,
who
,
for
want
of
understanding
or
honour
,
or
through
pernicious
habits
,
give
themselves
up
to
libertinism
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
These
were
great
advantages
,
"
said
Miss
Sutton
;
"
but
in
you
,
they
met
with
a
surprising
genius
,
'
tis
very
plain
,
Madam
;
and
there
is
not
,
in
my
opinion
,
a
lady
of
England
,
of
your
years
,
who
would
have
improved
by
them
as
you
have
done
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
answered
,
that
I
was
much
obliged
by
her
good
opinion
:
and
that
I
had
always
observed
,
the
person
who
admired
any
good
qualities
in
another
,
gave
a
kind
of
natural
demonstration
,
that
she
had
the
same
in
an
eminent
degree
herself
,
although
,
perhaps
,
her
modest
diffidence
would
not
permit
her
to
trace
the
generous
principle
to
its
source
.
  
<EOS>
The
dean
,
to
renew
the
subject
of
credulity
,
repeated
my
remark
,
that
it
was
safer
,
in
cases
where
so
much
depended
upon
the
issue
,
as
a
lady
's
honour
and
reputation
,
to
fear
an
enemy
,
than
to
hope
a
friend
;
and
praised
my
observation
,
that
even
a
weak
enemy
is
not
to
be
too
much
despised
.
  
<EOS>
I
said
,
I
had
very
high
notions
of
the
honour
and
value
of
my
own
sex
,
and
very
mean
ones
of
the
gay
and
frothy
part
of
the
other
;
insomuch
,
that
I
thought
they
could
have
no
strength
,
but
what
was
founded
in
our
weakness
:
that
the
difference
of
education
must
give
men
advantages
,
even
where
the
genius
is
naturally
equal
;
besides
,
they
have
generally
more
hardness
of
heart
,
which
makes
women
,
where
they
meet
not
with
men
of
honour
,
engage
with
that
sex
upon
very
unequal
terms
;
for
that
it
is
so
customary
with
them
to
make
vows
and
promises
,
and
to
set
light
by
them
,
when
made
,
that
an
innocent
lady
can
not
guard
too
watchfully
against
them
;
and
,
in
my
opinion
,
should
believe
nothing
they
said
,
or
even
vowed
,
but
what
carried
demonstration
with
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
remember
my
lady
used
often
to
observe
,
there
is
a
time
of
life
in
all
young
persons
,
which
may
properly
be
called
the
romantic
,
which
is
a
very
dangerous
period
,
and
requires
therefore
a
great
guard
of
prudence
;
that
the
risque
is
not
a
little
augmented
by
reading
novels
and
romances
;
and
the
poetical
tribe
have
much
to
answer
for
,
by
reason
of
their
heightened
and
inflaming
descriptions
,
which
do
much
hurt
to
thoughtless
minds
,
and
lively
imaginations
.
<EOS>
For
to
those
,
she
would
have
it
,
are
principally
owing
,
the
rashness
and
indiscretion
of
soft
and
tender
dispositions
:
which
,
in
breach
of
their
duty
,
and
even
to
the
disgrace
of
their
sex
,
too
frequently
set
them
upon
enterprises
,
like
those
they
have
read
in
those
pernicious
writings
,
which
not
seldom
make
them
fall
a
sacrifice
to
the
base
designs
of
some
wild
intriguer
;
and
even
in
cases
where
their
precipitation
ends
the
best
,
that
is
to
say
,
in
marriage
,
they
too
frequently
(
in
direct
opposition
to
the
cautions
and
commands
of
their
tried
,
their
experienced
,
and
unquestionable
friends
)
throw
themselves
upon
an
almost
stranger
,
who
,
had
he
been
worthy
of
them
,
would
not
,
nor
needed
to
have
taken
indirect
methods
to
obtain
their
favour
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
the
misfortune
is
,
<EOS>
the
most
innocent
are
generally
the
most
credulous
.
<EOS>
Such
a
lady
would
do
no
harm
to
others
,
and
can
not
think
others
would
do
her
any
.
<EOS>
And
as
to
the
particular
person
who
has
obtained
,
perhaps
,
a
share
in
her
confidence
,
he
can
not
,
she
thinks
,
be
so
ungrateful
,
as
to
return
irreparable
mischief
for
her
good
-
will
to
him
.
<EOS>
Were
all
the
men
in
the
world
besides
to
prove
false
,
the
beloved
person
can
not
.
 
<EOS>
'
Twould
be
unjust
to
her
own
merit
,
as
well
as
to
his
views
,
to
suppose
it
:
and
so
design
on
his
side
,
and
credulity
and
self
-
opinion
,
on
the
lady
's
,
at
last
enrol
the
unhappy
believer
in
the
list
of
the
too
-
late
repenters
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
what
,
Madam
,
"
said
the
dean
,
"
has
not
that
wretch
to
answer
for
,
who
makes
sport
of
destroying
a
virtuous
character
,
and
in
being
the
wicked
means
of
throwing
,
perhaps
,
upon
the
town
,
and
into
the
dregs
of
prostitution
,
a
poor
creature
,
whose
love
for
him
,
and
confidence
in
him
<EOS>
,
was
all
her
crime
?
<EOS>
and
who
otherwise
might
have
made
a
worthy
figure
at
the
head
of
a
reputable
family
,
and
so
have
been
an
useful
member
of
the
commonwealth
,
propagating
good
examples
,
instead
of
ruin
and
infamy
,
to
mankind
?
<EOS>
To
say
nothing
of
,
what
is
still
worse
,
the
dreadful
crime
of
occasioning
the
loss
of
a
soul
;
since
final
impenitence
too
generally
follows
the
first
sacrifice
which
the
poor
wretch
is
seduced
to
make
of
her
honour
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
are
several
gentlemen
in
our
neighbourhood
,
"
said
Mrs.
Brooks
,
"
who
might
be
benefited
by
this
touching
reflection
,
if
represented
in
the
same
strong
lights
from
the
pulpit
.
<EOS>
And
I
think
,
Mr.
Dean
,
you
should
give
us
a
sermon
upon
this
subject
,
for
the
sake
of
both
sexes
,
one
for
caution
,
the
other
for
conviction
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
think
of
it
,
"
replied
he
,
"
but
I
am
sorry
to
say
,
that
we
have
too
many
among
our
younger
gentry
who
would
think
themselves
pointed
at
were
I
to
touch
this
subject
ever
so
cautiously
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
,
"
said
Mrs.
Towers
,
"
there
can
not
well
be
a
more
useful
one
;
and
the
very
reason
the
dean
gives
,
is
a
convincing
proof
of
it
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
When
I
have
had
the
pleasure
of
hearing
the
further
sentiments
of
such
an
assembly
as
this
,
upon
the
delicate
subject
,
"
replied
this
polite
divine
,
"
I
shall
be
better
enabled
to
treat
it
.
<EOS>
And
pray
,
ladies
,
proceed
;
for
it
is
from
your
conversation
that
I
must
take
my
hints
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
only
,
then
,
"
said
Mrs.
Towers
,
"
to
engage
Mrs.
B.
to
speak
,
and
you
may
be
sure
<EOS>
,
we
will
all
be
as
attentive
to
her
,
as
we
shall
be
to
you
,
when
we
have
the
pleasure
to
hear
so
fine
a
genius
improving
upon
her
hints
,
from
the
pulpit
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
bowed
to
Mrs.
Towers
;
and
knowing
she
praised
me
,
with
the
dean
's
view
,
in
order
to
induce
the
young
ladies
to
give
the
greater
attention
to
what
she
wished
me
to
speak
,
I
said
,
it
would
be
a
great
presumption
in
me
,
after
so
high
a
compliment
,
to
open
my
lips
:
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
as
I
was
sure
,
by
speaking
,
I
should
have
the
benefit
of
instruction
,
whenever
it
made
them
speak
,
I
would
not
be
backward
to
enter
upon
any
subject
;
for
that
I
should
consider
myself
as
a
young
counsel
,
in
some
great
cause
,
who
served
but
to
open
it
and
prepare
the
way
for
those
of
greater
skill
and
abilities
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
beg
,
then
,
Madam
,
"
said
Miss
Stapylton
,
"
you
will
open
the
cause
,
be
the
subject
what
it
will
.
<EOS>
And
I
could
almost
wish
,
that
we
had
as
many
gentlemen
here
as
ladies
,
who
would
have
reason
to
be
ashamed
of
the
liberties
they
take
in
censuring
the
conversations
of
the
tea
-
table
;
since
the
pulpit
,
as
the
worthy
dean
gives
us
reason
to
hope
,
may
be
beholden
to
that
of
Mrs.
B.
"
  
"
<EOS>
Nor
is
it
much
wonder
,
"
replied
I
,
"
when
the
dean
himself
is
with
us
,
and
it
is
graced
by
so
distinguished
a
circle
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
many
of
our
young
gentlemen
,
were
here
,
"
said
Mrs.
Towers
,
"
they
might
improve
themselves
in
all
the
graces
of
polite
and
sincere
complaisance
.
<EOS>
But
,
compared
to
this
,
I
have
generally
heard
such
trite
and
coarse
stuff
from
our
race
of
would
-
be
wits
,
that
what
they
say
may
be
compared
to
the
fawnings
and
salutations
of
the
ass
in
the
fable
,
who
,
emulating
the
lap
-
dog
,
merited
a
cudgel
rather
than
encouragement
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
Mrs.
B.
,
"
continued
she
,
"
begin
<EOS>
,
I
pray
you
,
to
open
and
proceed
in
the
cause
;
for
there
will
be
no
counsel
employed
<EOS>
but
you
,
I
can
tell
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
give
me
a
subject
that
will
suit
me
,
ladies
,
and
you
shall
see
how
my
obedience
to
your
commands
will
make
me
run
on
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Will
you
,
Madam
,
"
said
Miss
Stapylton
,
"
give
us
a
few
cautions
and
instructions
on
a
theme
of
your
own
,
that
a
young
lady
should
rather
fear
too
much
than
hope
too
much
?
<EOS>
A
necessary
doctrine
,
perhaps
;
but
a
difficult
one
to
be
practised
by
one
who
has
begun
to
love
,
and
who
supposes
all
truth
and
honour
in
the
object
of
her
favour
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Hope
,
Madam
,
"
said
I
,
"
in
my
opinion
,
should
never
be
unaccompanied
by
fear
;
and
the
more
reason
will
a
lady
ever
have
to
fear
,
and
to
suspect
herself
,
and
doubt
her
lover
,
when
she
once
begins
to
find
in
her
own
breast
an
inclination
to
him
.
<EOS>
For
then
her
danger
is
doubled
,
since
she
has
herself
(
perhaps
the
more
dangerous
enemy
of
the
two
)
to
guard
against
,
as
well
as
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
may
secretly
wish
the
best
indeed
:
but
what
has
been
the
fate
of
others
may
be
her
own
;
and
though
she
thinks
it
not
probable
,
from
such
a
faithful
protester
,
as
he
appears
to
her
to
be
,
yet
,
while
it
is
possible
,
she
should
never
be
off
her
guard
:
nor
will
a
prudent
woman
trust
to
his
mercy
or
honour
;
but
to
her
own
discretion
:
and
the
rather
,
because
,
if
he
mean
well
,
he
himself
will
value
her
the
more
for
her
caution
,
since
every
man
desires
to
have
a
virtuous
and
prudent
wife
;
if
not
well
,
she
will
detect
him
the
sooner
,
and
<EOS>
so
,
by
her
prudence
,
frustrate
all
his
base
designs
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
let
me
,
my
dear
ladies
,
ask
,
what
that
passion
is
,
which
generally
we
dignify
by
the
name
of
love
;
and
which
,
when
so
dignified
,
puts
us
upon
a
thousand
extravagances
?
<EOS>
I
believe
,
if
examined
into
,
it
would
be
found
too
generally
to
owe
its
original
to
ungoverned
fancy
;
and
were
we
to
judge
of
it
by
the
consequences
that
usually
attend
it
,
it
ought
rather
to
be
called
rashness
,
inconsideration
,
weakness
,
and
thing
but
love
;
for
very
seldom
,
I
doubt
,
is
the
solid
judgment
so
much
concerned
in
it
,
as
the
airy
fancy
.
<EOS>
But
when
once
we
dignify
the
wild
mis
-
leader
with
the
name
of
love
,
all
the
absurdities
which
we
read
in
novels
and
romances
take
place
,
and
we
are
induced
to
follow
examples
that
seldom
end
happily
but
in
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
permit
me
further
to
observe
,
that
love
,
as
we
call
it
,
operates
differently
in
the
two
sexes
,
as
to
its
effects
.
<EOS>
For
in
woman
it
is
a
creeping
thing
,
in
a
man
an
incroacher
;
and
this
ought
,
in
my
humble
opinion
,
to
be
very
seriously
attended
to
.
<EOS>
Miss
Sutton
intimated
thus
much
,
when
she
observed
that
it
was
the
man
's
province
to
ask
,
the
lady
's
to
deny
:
 
excuse
me
.
<EOS>
Madam
,
the
observation
was
just
,
as
to
the
men
's
notions
;
although
,
methinks
,
I
would
not
have
a
lady
allow
of
it
,
except
in
cases
of
caution
to
themselves
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
doubt
,
therefore
,
which
a
lady
has
of
her
lover
's
honour
,
is
needful
to
preserve
her
own
and
his
too
.
<EOS>
And
if
she
does
him
wrong
,
and
he
should
be
too
just
to
deceive
her
,
she
can
make
him
amends
,
by
instances
of
greater
confidence
,
when
she
pleases
.
<EOS>
But
if
she
has
been
accustomed
to
grant
him
little
favours
,
can
she
easily
recal
them
?
<EOS>
And
will
not
the
incroacher
grow
upon
her
indulgence
,
pleading
for
a
favour
to
-
day
,
which
was
not
refused
him
yesterday
,
and
reproaching
her
want
of
confidence
,
as
a
want
of
esteem
;
till
the
poor
lady
,
who
,
perhaps
,
has
given
way
to
the
creeping
,
insinuating
passion
,
and
has
avowed
her
esteem
for
him
,
puts
herself
too
much
in
his
power
,
in
order
to
manifest
,
as
she
thinks
,
the
generosity
of
her
affection
;
and
so
,
by
degrees
,
is
carried
farther
than
she
intended
,
or
nice
honour
ought
to
have
permitted
;
and
all
,
because
,
to
keep
up
to
my
theme
,
she
hopes
too
much
,
and
doubts
too
little
?
<EOS>
And
there
have
been
cases
,
where
a
man
himself
,
pursuing
the
dictates
of
his
incroaching
passion
,
and
finding
a
lady
too
conceding
,
has
taken
advantages
,
of
which
,
probably
,
at
first
he
did
not
presume
to
think
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Stapylton
said
,
that
virtue
itself
spoke
when
I
spoke
;
and
she
was
resolved
to
recollect
as
much
of
this
conversation
as
she
could
,
and
write
it
down
in
her
common
-
place
book
,
where
it
would
make
a
better
figure
than
any
thing
she
had
there
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
,
Miss
,
"
said
Mrs.
Towers
,
"
your
chief
collections
are
flowers
of
rhetoric
,
picked
up
from
the
French
and
English
poets
,
and
novel
-
writers
.
<EOS>
I
would
give
something
for
the
pleasure
of
having
it
two
hours
in
my
possession
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Fie
,
Madam
,
"
replied
she
,
a
little
abashed
,
"
how
can
you
expose
your
kinswoman
thus
,
before
the
dean
and
Mrs.
B.
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Mrs.
Towers
,
"
said
I
,
"
only
says
this
to
provoke
you
to
shew
your
collections
.
<EOS>
I
wish
I
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
them
.
<EOS>
I
doubt
not
but
your
common
-
place
book
is
a
store
-
house
of
wisdom
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
nothing
bad
in
it
,
I
hope
,
"
replied
she
;
"
but
I
would
not
,
that
Mrs.
B.
should
see
it
for
the
world
.
<EOS>
But
,
Madam
"
(
to
Mrs.
Towers
)
,
"
there
are
many
beautiful
things
,
and
good
instructions
,
to
be
collected
from
novels
and
plays
,
and
romances
;
and
from
the
poetical
writers
particularly
,
light
as
you
are
pleased
to
make
of
them
.
<EOS>
Pray
,
Madam
"
(
to
me
)
,
"
have
you
ever
been
at
all
conversant
in
such
writers
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
a
great
deal
in
the
former
:
there
were
very
few
novels
and
romances
that
my
lady
would
permit
me
to
read
;
and
those
I
did
,
gave
me
no
great
pleasure
;
for
either
they
dealt
so
much
in
the
marvellous
and
improbable
,
or
were
so
unnaturally
inflaming
to
the
passions
,
and
so
full
of
love
and
intrigue
,
that
most
of
them
seemed
calculated
to
fire
the
imagination
,
rather
than
to
inform
the
judgment
.
<EOS>
Titles
and
tournaments
,
breaking
of
spears
in
honour
of
a
mistress
,
engaging
with
monsters
,
rambling
in
search
of
adventures
,
making
unnatural
difficulties
,
in
order
to
shew
the
knight
-
errant
's
prowess
in
overcoming
them
,
is
all
that
is
required
to
constitute
the
hero
in
such
pieces
.
<EOS>
And
what
principally
distinguishes
the
character
of
the
heroine
is
,
when
she
is
taught
to
consider
her
father
's
house
as
an
enchanted
castle
,
and
her
lover
as
the
hero
who
is
to
dissolve
the
charm
,
and
to
set
at
liberty
from
one
confinement
,
in
order
to
put
her
into
another
,
and
,
too
probably
,
a
worse
:
to
instruct
her
how
to
climb
walls
,
leap
precipices
,
and
do
twenty
other
extravagant
things
,
in
order
to
shew
the
mad
strength
of
a
passion
she
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
;
to
make
parents
and
guardians
pass
for
tyrants
,
the
voice
of
reason
to
be
drowned
in
that
of
indiscreet
love
,
which
exalts
the
other
sex
,
and
debases
her
own
.
<EOS>
And
what
is
the
instruction
that
can
be
gathered
from
such
pieces
,
for
the
conduct
of
common
life
?
  
<EOS>
"
Then
have
I
been
ready
to
quarrel
with
these
writers
for
another
reason
;
and
that
is
,
the
dangerous
notion
which
they
hardly
ever
fail
to
propagate
,
of
a
first
-
sight
love
.
<EOS>
For
there
is
such
a
susceptibility
supposed
on
both
sides
(
which
,
however
it
may
pass
in
a
man
,
very
little
becomes
the
female
delicacy
)
that
they
are
smitten
with
a
glance
:
the
fictitious
blind
god
is
made
a
real
divinity
:
and
too
often
prudence
and
discretion
are
the
first
offerings
at
his
shrine
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
,
Madam
,
"
said
Miss
Stapylton
,
blushing
,
and
playing
with
her
fan
,
"
there
have
been
many
instances
of
people
's
loving
at
first
sight
,
which
have
ended
very
happily
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
doubt
of
it
,
"
replied
I.
"
<EOS>
But
there
are
three
chances
to
one
,
that
so
precipitate
a
liking
<EOS>
does
not
.
<EOS>
For
where
can
be
the
room
for
caution
,
enquiry
,
the
display
of
merit
and
sincerity
,
and
even
the
assurance
of
a
grateful
return
,
to
a
lady
,
who
thus
suffers
herself
to
be
prepossessed
?
<EOS>
Is
it
not
a
random
shot
?
<EOS>
Is
it
not
a
proof
of
weakness
?
<EOS>
Is
it
not
giving
up
the
negative
voice
,
which
belongs
to
the
sex
,
even
while
she
is
not
sure
of
meeting
with
the
affirmative
one
from
him
whose
affection
she
wishes
to
engage
?
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
,
ladies
,
"
continued
I
,
"
I
can
not
help
concluding
(
and
I
am
the
less
afraid
of
speaking
my
mind
,
because
of
the
opinion
I
have
of
the
prudence
of
every
lady
that
hears
me
)
,
that
where
this
weakness
is
found
,
it
is
no
way
favourable
to
a
lady
's
character
,
nor
to
that
discretion
which
ought
to
distinguish
it
.
<EOS>
It
looks
to
me
,
as
if
a
lady
's
heart
were
too
much
in
the
power
of
her
eye
,
and
that
she
had
permitted
her
fancy
to
be
much
more
busy
than
her
judgment
.
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Stapylton
blushed
,
and
looked
around
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
observe
,
"
said
Mrs.
Towers
,
"
whenever
you
censure
any
indiscretion
,
you
seldom
fail
to
give
cautions
how
to
avoid
it
;
and
pray
let
us
know
what
is
to
be
done
in
this
case
?
<EOS>
That
is
to
say
,
how
a
young
lady
ought
to
guard
against
and
overcome
the
first
favourable
impressions
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
I
imagine
,
"
replied
I
,
"
a
young
lady
ought
to
do
,
on
any
the
least
favourable
impressions
of
the
kind
,
is
immediately
to
withdraw
into
herself
,
as
one
may
say
;
to
reflect
upon
what
she
owes
to
her
parents
,
to
her
family
,
to
her
character
,
and
to
her
sex
;
and
to
resolve
to
check
such
a
random
prepossession
,
which
may
much
more
probably
,
as
I
hinted
,
make
her
a
prey
to
the
undeserving
than
otherwise
,
as
there
are
so
many
of
that
character
to
one
man
of
real
merit
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
most
that
I
apprehend
a
first
-
sight
approbation
can
do
,
is
to
inspire
a
liking
;
and
a
liking
is
conquerable
,
if
the
person
will
not
brood
over
it
,
till
she
hatches
it
into
love
.
<EOS>
Then
every
man
and
woman
has
a
black
and
a
white
side
;
and
it
is
easy
to
set
the
imperfections
of
the
person
against
the
supposed
perfections
,
while
it
is
only
a
liking
.
<EOS>
But
if
the
busy
fancy
be
permitted
to
work
as
it
pleases
,
uncontrolled
,
then
'
tis
very
likely
,
were
the
lady
but
to
keep
herself
in
countenance
for
receiving
first
impressions
,
she
will
see
perfections
in
the
object
,
which
no
other
living
soul
can
.
<EOS>
And
it
may
be
expected
,
that
as
a
consequence
of
her
first
indiscretion
,
she
will
confirm
,
as
an
act
of
her
judgment
,
what
her
wild
and
ungoverned
fancy
had
misled
her
to
think
of
with
so
much
partial
favour
.
<EOS>
And
too
late
,
as
it
probably
may
happen
,
she
will
see
and
lament
her
fatal
,
and
,
perhaps
,
undutiful
error
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
are
talking
of
the
ladies
only
,
"
added
I
(
for
I
saw
Miss
Stapylton
was
become
very
grave
)
:
<EOS>
"
but
I
believe
first
-
sight
love
often
operates
too
powerfully
in
both
sexes
:
and
where
it
does
so
,
it
will
be
very
lucky
,
if
either
gentleman
or
lady
find
reason
,
on
cool
reflection
,
to
approve
a
choice
which
they
were
so
ready
to
make
without
thought
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
'
Tis
allowed
,
"
said
Mrs.
Towers
,
"
that
rash
and
precipitate
love
may
operate
pretty
much
alike
in
the
rash
and
precipitate
of
both
sexes
:
and
which
soever
loves
,
generally
exalts
the
person
beloved
above
his
or
her
merits
:
but
I
am
desirous
,
for
the
sake
of
us
maiden
ladies
,
since
it
is
a
science
in
which
you
are
so
great
an
adept
,
to
have
your
advice
,
how
we
should
watch
and
guard
its
first
incroachments
and
that
you
will
tell
us
what
you
apprehend
gives
the
men
most
advantage
over
us
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nay
,
now
,
Mrs.
Towers
,
you
rally
my
presumption
,
indeed
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
admire
you
,
Madam
,
"
replied
she
,
"
and
every
thing
you
say
and
do
;
and
I
wo
n't
forgive
you
to
call
what
I
so
seriously
say
and
think
,
raillery
.
<EOS>
For
my
own
part
,
"
continued
she
,
"
I
never
was
in
love
yet
,
nor
,
I
believe
,
were
any
of
these
young
ladies
.
"
<EOS>
(
Miss
Cope
looked
a
little
silly
upon
this
.
)
<EOS>
"
And
who
can
better
instruct
us
to
guard
our
hearts
,
than
a
lady
who
has
so
well
defended
her
own
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
then
,
Madam
,
if
I
must
speak
,
I
think
,
what
gives
the
other
sex
the
greatest
advantage
over
even
many
of
the
most
deserving
ones
,
is
that
dangerous
foible
,
the
love
of
praise
,
and
the
desire
to
be
flattered
and
admired
,
a
passion
I
have
observed
to
predominate
,
more
or
less
,
from
sixteen
to
sixty
,
in
most
of
our
sex
.
<EOS>
We
are
too
generally
delighted
with
the
company
of
those
who
extol
our
graces
of
person
or
mind
:
for
,
will
not
a
grateful
lady
study
hard
to
return
a
few
compliments
to
a
gentleman
who
makes
her
so
many
!
<EOS>
She
is
concerned
to
prove
him
a
man
of
distinguished
sense
,
or
a
polite
man
,
at
least
,
in
regard
to
what
she
thinks
of
herself
;
and
so
the
flatterer
shall
be
preferred
to
such
of
the
sincere
and
worthy
,
as
can
not
say
what
they
do
not
think
.
<EOS>
And
by
this
means
many
an
excellent
lady
has
fallen
a
prey
to
some
sordid
designer
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
,
I
think
,
nothing
can
give
gentlemen
so
much
advantage
over
our
sex
,
as
to
see
how
readily
a
virtuous
lady
can
forgive
the
capital
faults
of
the
most
abandoned
of
the
other
;
and
that
sad
,
sad
notion
,
that
a
reformed
rake
makes
the
best
husband
;
a
notion
that
has
done
more
hurt
,
and
discredit
too
,
to
our
sex
(
as
it
has
given
more
encouragement
to
the
profligate
,
and
more
discouragement
to
the
sober
gentlemen
)
,
than
can
be
easily
imagined
.
<EOS>
A
fine
thing
,
indeed
I
as
if
the
wretch
,
who
had
run
through
a
course
of
iniquity
,
to
the
endangering
of
soul
and
body
,
was
to
be
deemed
the
best
companion
for
life
,
to
an
innocent
and
virtuous
young
lady
,
who
is
to
owe
the
kindness
of
his
treatment
to
her
,
to
his
having
never
before
accompanied
with
a
modest
woman
;
nor
,
till
his
interest
on
one
hand
(
to
which
his
extravagance
,
perhaps
,
compels
him
to
attend
)
,
and
his
impaired
constitution
on
the
other
,
oblige
him
to
it
,
so
much
as
wished
to
accompany
with
one
;
and
who
always
made
a
jest
of
the
marriage
state
,
and
perhaps
,
of
every
thing
either
serious
or
sacred
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
observe
,
very
well
,
"
said
Mrs.
Towers
:
"
<EOS>
but
people
will
be
apt
to
think
,
that
you
have
less
reason
than
any
of
our
sex
,
to
be
severe
against
such
a
notion
:
for
who
was
a
greater
rake
than
a
certain
gentleman
,
and
who
is
a
better
husband
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Madam
,
"
replied
I
,
"
the
gentleman
you
mean
,
never
was
a
common
town
rake
:
he
is
a
man
of
sense
,
and
fine
understanding
:
and
his
reformation
,
secondarily
,
as
I
may
say
,
has
been
the
natural
effect
of
those
extraordinary
qualities
.
<EOS>
But
also
,
I
will
presume
to
say
,
that
that
gentleman
,
as
he
has
not
many
equals
in
the
nobleness
of
his
nature
,
so
he
is
not
likely
,
I
doubt
,
to
have
many
followers
,
in
a
reformation
begun
in
the
bloom
of
youth
,
upon
self
-
conviction
,
and
altogether
,
humanly
speaking
,
spontaneous
.
<EOS>
Those
ladies
who
would
plead
his
example
,
in
support
of
this
pernicious
notion
,
should
find
out
the
same
generous
qualities
in
the
man
,
before
they
trust
to
it
:
and
it
will
then
do
less
harm
;
though
even
then
,
I
could
not
wish
it
to
be
generally
entertained
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
really
unaccountable
,
"
said
Mrs.
Towers
,
"
after
all
,
as
Mrs.
B.
,
I
remember
,
said
on
another
occasion
,
that
our
sex
should
not
as
much
insist
upon
virtue
and
sobriety
,
in
the
character
of
a
man
,
as
a
man
,
be
he
ever
such
a
rake
,
does
in
that
of
a
lady
.
<EOS>
And
'
tis
certainly
a
great
encouragement
to
libertinism
,
that
a
worn
-
out
debauchee
should
think
himself
at
any
time
good
enough
for
a
husband
,
and
have
the
confidence
to
imagine
,
that
a
modest
woman
will
accept
of
his
address
,
with
a
preference
of
him
to
any
other
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
account
for
it
but
one
way
,
"
said
the
dean
:
"
and
that
is
,
that
a
modest
woman
is
apt
to
be
diffident
of
her
own
merit
and
understanding
<EOS>
and
she
thinks
this
diffidence
an
imperfection
.
<EOS>
A
rake
never
is
troubled
with
it
:
so
he
has
in
perfection
a
quality
she
thinks
she
wants
;
and
,
knowing
too
little
_
of
the
world
,
imagines
<EOS>
she
mends
the
matter
by
accepting
of
one
who
knows
too
much
_
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
well
observed
,
Mr.
Dean
,
"
said
Mrs.
Towers
:
"
but
there
is
another
fault
in
our
sex
,
which
Mrs.
B.
has
not
touched
upon
;
and
that
is
,
the
foolish
vanity
some
women
have
,
in
the
hopes
of
reforming
a
wild
fellow
;
and
that
they
shall
be
able
to
do
more
than
any
of
their
sex
before
them
could
do
:
a
vanity
that
often
costs
them
dear
,
as
I
know
in
more
than
one
instance
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Another
weakness
,
"
said
I
,
"
might
be
produced
against
some
of
our
sex
,
who
join
too
readily
to
droll
upon
,
and
sneer
at
,
the
misfortune
of
any
poor
young
creature
,
who
has
shewn
too
little
regard
for
her
honour
:
and
who
(
instead
of
speaking
of
it
with
concern
,
and
inveighing
against
the
seducer
)
too
lightly
sport
with
the
unhappy
person
's
fall
;
industriously
spread
the
knowledge
of
it
"
<EOS>
[
I
would
not
look
upon
Miss
Sutton
,
while
I
spoke
this
]
,
"
and
avoid
her
,
as
one
infected
;
and
yet
scruple
not
to
admit
into
their
company
the
vile
aggressor
;
and
even
to
smile
with
him
,
at
his
barbarous
jests
,
upon
the
poor
sufferer
of
their
own
sex
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
known
three
or
four
instances
of
this
in
my
time

"
said
Mrs.
Towers
,
that
Miss
Sutton
might
not
take
it
to
herself
;
<EOS>
for
she
looked
down
and
was
a
little
serious
.
  
<EOS>
"
This
,
"
replied
I
,
"
puts
me
in
mind
of
a
little
humourous
copy

I

by
Mr.

which
,
to
the
very
purpose

calls

<EOS>
The
ladies
were
pleased
with
the
lines
;
but
Mrs.
Towers
wanted
to
know
at
what
time
of
Mr.
B.
's
life
they
could
be
written
.
"
<EOS>
Because
,
"
added
she
,
<EOS>
"
I
never
suspected
,
before

that
the
good
gentleman
ever
took
pains
to
write
cautions

exhortations

to
avoid
the
delusions

<EOS>
These
verses
,
and
these
facetious
,
but
severe
,
remarks
of
Mrs.
Towers
,
made
every
young
lady
look
up
with
a
cheerful
countenance
;
because
it
pushed
the
ball
from
self
:
and
the
dean
said
to
his
daughter
,
"
So
,
my
dear
,
you

so
attentive

Mrs.

so
excellently
said

"
I
observe
.
<EOS>
Sir
,
from
the
faults
the
ladies
have
so
justly
imputed
to
some
of
our
sex
,
that
the
advantage
the
gentlemen
chiefly
have
over
us
,
is
from
our
own
weakness
:
and
that
it
behoves
a
prudent
woman
to
guard
against
first
impressions
of
favour
,
since
she
will
think
herself
obliged
,
in
compliment
to
her
own
judgment
,
to
find
reasons
,
if
possible
,
to
confirm
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
wish
to
know
if
there
be
any
way
that
a
woman
can
judge
,
whether
a
man
means
honourably
or
not
,
in
his
address
to
her
!

<EOS>
"
Mrs.

There

"
said

they
all
were
very
attentive

<EOS>
"
I
lay
it
down
as
an
undoubted
truth

"
said
I
,
"
that
true
love
is
one
of
the
most
respectful
things
in

<EOS>
It
strikes
with
awe

reverence
the
mind
of
the
man

boasts
its
impressions

It
is
chaste

pure

it

to
her

it

he

little

The
ladies

so
kind

applaud
all
I
said

so
did
the
dean
.
<EOS>
Miss
Stapylton
,
Miss
Cope

and
Miss

were
to
write
down
what
they
could
remember
of
the
conversation
:
and
our
noble
guests
coming
in
soon
after
,
with
Mr.
B.
,
the
ladies
would
have
departed
;
but
he
prevailed
upon
them
to
pass
the
evening
;
and
Miss
L.
,
who
had
an
admirable
finger
on
the
harpsichord
,
as
I
have
before
said
,
obliged
us
with
two
or
three
lessons
.
<EOS>
Each
of
the
ladies
did
the
like

prevailed
upon
me
to
play
a
tune

two

but
Miss
Cope
,
as
well
as
Miss

,
surpassed
me
much
.

We
all
sung

obliged
us
on
the
violincello
:
Mr.
H.
played
on
the
German
flute
,
and
sung
us
a
fop
's
song
,
and
performed
it
in
character
;
so
that
we
had
an
exceeding
gay
evening
,
and
parted
with
great
satisfaction
on
all
sides
,
particularly
on
the
young
ladies
;
for
this
put
them
all
in
good
humour
,
and
good
spirits
,
enlivening
the
former
scene
,
which
otherwise
might
have
closed
,
perhaps
more
gravely
than
efficaciously
.
  
<EOS>
The
distance
of
time
since
this
conversation
passed
,
enables
me
to
add
what
I
could
not
do
,
when
I
wrote
the
account
of
it
,
which
you
have
mislaid
:
and
which
take
briefly
,
as
follows
:
  
Miss
Stapylton
was
as
good
as
her
word
,
and
wrote
down
all
she
could
recollect
of
the
conversation
:
and
I
having
already
sent
her
the
letter
she
desired
,
containing
my
observations
upon
the
flighty
style
she
so
much
admired
,
it
had
such
an
effect
upon
her
,
as
to
turn
the
course
of
her
reading
and
studies
to
weightier
and
more
solid
subjects
;
and
avoiding
the
gentleman
she
had
begun
to
favour
,
gave
way
to
her
parents
'
recommendations
,
and
is
happily
married
to
Sir
Jonathan
Barnes
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Cope
came
to
me
a
week
after
,
with
the
leave
of
both
her
parents
,
and
tarried
with
me
three
days
;
in
which
time
she
opened
all
her
heart
to
me
,
and
returned
in
such
a
disposition
,
and
with
such
resolutions
,
that
she
never
would
see
her
peer
again
;
nor
receive
letters
from
him
,
which
she
owned
to
me
she
had
done
clandestinely
before
;
and
she
is
now
the
happy
lady
of
Sir
Michael
Beaumont
,
who
makes
her
the
best
of
husbands
,
and
permits
her
to
follow
her
charitable
inclinations
according
to
a
scheme
which
she
consulted
me
upon
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
L.
,
by
the
dean
's
indulgent
prudence
and
discretion
,
has
escaped
her
rake
;
and
upon
the
discovery
of
an
intrigue
he
was
carrying
on
with
another
,
conceived
a
just
abhorrence
of
him
;
and
is
since
married
to
Dr.
Jenkins
,
as
you
know
,
with
whom
she
lives
very
happily
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Sutton
is
not
quite
so
well
off
as
the
three
former
;
though
not
altogether
so
unhappy
neither
,
in
her
way
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
indeed
conquer
her
love
of
dress
and
tinsel
,
and
so
became
the
lady
of
Col
.
Wilson
:
and
they
are
thus
far
easy
in
the
marriage
state
,
that
,
being
seldom
together
,
they
have
probably
a
multitude
of
misunderstandings
;
for
the
colonel
loves
gaming
,
in
which
he
is
generally
a
winner
;
and
so
passes
his
time
mostly
in
town
.
<EOS>
His
lady
has
her
pleasures
,
neither
laudable
nor
criminal
ones
,
which
she
pursues
in
the
country
.
<EOS>
And
now
and
then
a
letter
passes
on
both
sides
,
by
.
<EOS>
the
inscription
and
subscription
of
which
they
remind
one
another
that
they
have
been
once
in
their
lives
at
one
church
together
,
  
<EOS>
And
what
now
,
my
dear
Lady
G.
,
have
I
to
add
to
this
tedious
account
(
for
letter
<EOS>
I
can
hardly
call
it
)
but
that
I
am
,
with
great
affection
,
your
true
friend
and
servant
,
  
P.B.
    
MY
DEAR
LADY
G.
,
  
<EOS>
You
desire
to
have
a
little
specimen
of
my
nursery
tales
and
stories
,
with
which
,
as
Miss
Fenwick
told
you
,
on
her
return
to
Lincolnshire
,
I
entertain
my
Miss
Goodwin
and
my
little
boys
.
<EOS>
But
you
make
me
too
high
<EOS>
a
compliment
,
when
you
tell
me
,
it
is
for
your
own
instruction
and
example
.
<EOS>
Yet
you
know
,
my
dear
Lady
G.
,
be
your
motives
what
they
will
,
I
must
obey
you
,
although
,
were
others
to
see
it
,
I
might
expose
myself
to
the
smiles
and
contempt
of
judges
less
prejudiced
in
my
favour
.
<EOS>
So
I
will
begin
without
any
further
apology
;
and
,
as
near
as
I
can
,
give
you
those
very
stories
with
which
Miss
Fenwick
was
so
pleased
,
and
of
which
she
has
made
so
favourable
a
report
.
  
<EOS>
Let
me
acquaint
you
,
then
,
that
my
method
is
to
give
characters
of
persons
I
have
known
in
one
part
or
other
of
my
life
,
in
feigned
names
,
whose
conduct
may
serve
for
imitation
or
warning
to
my
dear
attentive
Miss
;
and
sometimes
I
give
instances
of
good
boys
and
naughty
boys
,
for
the
sake
of
my
Billy
and
my
Davers
;
and
they
are
continually
coming
about
me
,
"
Dear
Madam
,
a
pretty
story
,
"
now
cries
Miss
:
"
and
dear
mamma
,
tell
me
of
good
boys
,
and
of
naughty
boys
,
"
cries
Billy
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
is
a
surprising
child
of
her
age
,
and
is
very
familiar
with
many
of
the
best
characters
in
the
Spectators
;
and
having
a
smattering
of
Latin
,
and
more
than
a
smattering
of
Italian
,
and
being
a
perfect
mistress
of
French
,
is
seldom
at
a
loss
for
a
derivation
of
such
words
as
are
not
of
English
original
.
<EOS>
And
so
I
shall
give
you
a
story
in
feigned
names
,
with
which
she
is
so
delighted
,
that
she
has
written
it
down
.
<EOS>
But
I
will
first
trespass
on
your
patience
with
one
of
my
childish
tales
.
  
<EOS>
Every
day
,
once
or
twice
,
I
cause
Miss
Goodwin
,
who
plays
and
sings
very
prettily
,
to
give
a
tune
or
two
to
me
,
my
Billy
and
my
Davers
,
who
,
as
well
as
my
Pamela
,
love
and
learn
to
touch
the
keys
,
young
as
the
latter
is
;
and
she
will
have
a
sweet
finger
;
I
can
observe
that
;
and
a
charming
ear
;
and
her
voice
is
music
itself!-"O
the
fond
,
fond
mother
!
<EOS>
"
I
know
you
will
say
,
on
reading
this
.
  
<EOS>
Then
,
Madam
,
we
all
proceed
,
hand
-
in
-
hand
,
together
to
the
nursery
,
to
my
Charley
and
Jemmy
:
and
in
this
happy
retirement
,
so
much
my
delight
in
the
absence
of
my
best
beloved
,
imagine
you
see
me
seated
,
surrounded
with
the
joy
and
the
hope
of
my
future
prospects
,
as
well
as
my
present
comforts
.
<EOS>
Miss
Goodwin
,
imagine
you
see
,
on
my
right
hand
,
sitting
on
a
velvet
stool
,
because
she
is
eldest
,
and
a
Miss
;
Billy
on
my
left
,
in
a
little
cane
elbow
-
chair
,
because
he
is
eldest
,
and
a
good
boy
;
my
Davers
,
and
my
sparkling
-
ey'd
Pamela
,
with
my
Charley
between
them
,
on
little
silken
cushions
,
at
my
feet
,
hand
-
in
-
hand
,
their
pleased
eyes
looking
up
to
my
more
delighted
ones
;
and
my
sweet
-
natured
promising
Jemmy
,
in
my
lap
;
the
nurses
and
the
cradle
just
behind
us
,
and
the
nursery
maids
delightedly
pursuing
some
useful
needle
-
work
for
the
dear
charmers
of
my
heart
<EOS>
-
All
as
hush
and
as
still
as
silence
itself
,
as
the
pretty
creatures
generally
are
,
when
their
little
,
watchful
eyes
see
my
lips
beginning
to
open
:
for
they
take
neat
notice
already
of
my
rule
of
two
ears
to
one
tongue
,
<EOS>
insomuch
that
if
Billy
or
Davers
are
either
of
them
for
breaking
the
mum
,
as
they
call
it
,
they
are
immediately
hush
,
at
any
time
,
if
I
put
my
finger
to
my
lip
,
or
if
Miss
points
hers
to
her
ear
,
even
to
the
breaking
of
a
word
in
two
,
as
it
were
:
and
yet
all
my
boys
are
as
lively
as
so
many
birds
:
while
my
Pamela
is
cheerful
,
easy
,
soft
,
gentle
,
always
smiling
,
but
modest
and
harmless
as
a
dove
.
  
<EOS>
I
began
with
a
story
of
two
little
boys
,
and
two
little
girls
,
the
children
of
a
fine
gentleman
,
and
a
fine
lady
,
who
loved
them
dearly
;
that
they
were
all
so
good
,
and
loved
one
another
so
well
,
that
every
body
who
saw
them
,
admired
them
,
and
talked
of
them
far
and
near
;
that
they
would
part
with
any
thing
to
the
another
;
loved
the
poor
;
spoke
kindly
to
the
servants
;
did
every
thing
they
were
bid
to
do
;
were
not
proud
;
knew
no
strife
,
but
who
should
learn
their
books
best
,
and
be
the
prettiest
scholar
;
that
the
servants
loved
them
,
and
would
do
any
thing
they
desired
;
that
they
were
not
proud
of
fine
clothes
;
let
not
their
heads
run
upon
their
playthings
when
they
should
mind
their
books
;
said
grace
before
they
eat
,
their
prayers
before
they
went
to
bed
,
and
as
soon
as
they
rose
;
were
always
clean
and
neat
;
would
not
tell
a
fib
for
the
world
,
and
were
above
doing
any
thing
that
required
one
;
that
God
blessed
them
more
and
more
,
and
blessed
their
papa
and
mamma
,
and
their
uncles
and
aunts
,
and
cousins
,
for
their
sakes
.
"
<EOS>
And
there
was
a
happy
family
,
my
dear
loves!-No
<EOS>
one
idle
<EOS>
;
all
prettily
employed
;
the
Masters
at
their
books
;
the
Misses
at
their
books
too
,
or
at
their
needles
;
except
at
their
play
-
hours
,
when
they
were
never
rude
,
nor
noisy
,
nor
mischievous
,
nor
quarrelsome
:
and
no
such
word
was
ever
heard
from
their
mouths
,
as
,
"
Why
may
n't
I
have
this
or
that
,
as
well
as
Billy
or
Bobby
?
"
<EOS>
Or
,
"
Why
should
Sally
have
this
or
that
,
any
more
than
I
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
it
was
,
"
<EOS>
As
my
mamma
pleases
;
my
mamma
knows
best
;
"
and
a
bow
and
a
smile
,
and
no
surliness
,
or
scowling
brow
to
be
seen
,
if
they
were
denied
any
thing
;
for
well
did
they
know
that
their
papa
and
mamma
loved
them
so
dearly
,
that
they
would
refuse
them
nothing
that
was
for
their
good
;
and
they
were
sure
<EOS>
when
they
were
refused
,
they
asked
for
something
that
would
have
done
them
hurt
,
had
it
been
granted
.
<EOS>
Never
were
such
good
boys
and
girls
as
these
I
<EOS>
And
they
grew
up
;
and
the
Masters
became
fine
scholars
,
and
fine
gentlemen
,
and
every
body
honoured
them
:
and
the
Misses
became
fine
ladies
,
and
fine
housewives
;
and
this
gentleman
,
when
they
grew
to
be
women
,
sought
to
marry
one
of
the
Misses
,
and
that
gentleman
the
other
;
and
happy
was
he
that
could
be
admitted
into
their
companies
I
so
that
they
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
pick
and
choose
out
of
the
best
gentlemen
in
the
country
:
while
the
greatest
ladies
for
birth
and
the
most
remarkable
for
virtue
(
which
,
my
dears
,
is
better
than
either
birth
or
fortune
)
,
thought
themselves
honoured
by
the
addresses
of
the
two
brothers
.
<EOS>
And
they
married
,
and
made
good
papas
and
mammas
,
and
were
so
many
blessings
to
the
age
in
which
they
lived
.
<EOS>
There
,
my
dear
loves
,
were
happy
sons
and
daughters
;
for
good
Masters
seldom
fail
to
make
good
gentlemen
;
and
good
Misses
,
good
ladies
;
and
God
blesses
them
with
as
good
children
as
they
were
to
their
parents
;
and
<EOS>
so
the
blessing
goes
<EOS>
round!-Who
would
not
but
be
good
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Well
,
but
,
mamma
,
we
will
all
be
good:-Won't
we
,
Master
Davers
?
<EOS>
"
cries
my
Billy
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
brother
Billy
.
<EOS>
But
what
will
become
of
the
naughty
boys
?
<EOS>
Tell
us
,
mamma
,
about
the
naughty
boys
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
there
was
a
poor
,
poor
widow
woman
,
who
had
three
naughty
sons
,
and
one
naughty
daughter
;
and
they
would
do
nothing
that
their
mamma
bid
them
do
;
were
always
quarrelling
,
scratching
,
and
fighting
;
would
not
say
their
prayers
;
would
not
learn
their
books
;
so
that
the
little
boys
used
to
laugh
at
them
,
and
point
at
them
,
as
they
went
along
,
for
blockheads
;
and
nobody
loved
them
,
or
took
notice
of
them
,
except
to
beat
and
thump
them
about
,
for
their
naughty
ways
,
and
their
undutifulness
to
their
poor
mother
,
who
worked
hard
to
maintain
them
.
<EOS>
As
they
grew
up
,
they
grew
worse
and
worse
,
and
more
and
more
stupid
and
ignorant
;
so
that
they
impoverished
their
poor
mother
,
and
at
last
broke
her
heart
,
poor
poor
widow
woman
!
 
<EOS>
And
her
neighbours
joined
together
to
bury
the
poor
widow
woman
:
for
these
sad
ungracious
children
made
away
with
what
little
she
had
left
,
while
she
was
ill
,
before
her
heart
was
quite
broken
;
and
this
helped
to
break
it
the
sooner
:
for
had
she
lived
<EOS>
,
she
saw
she
must
have
wanted
bread
,
and
had
no
comfort
with
such
wicked
children
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Poor
poor
widow
woman
!
"
said
my
Billy
,
with
tears
;
and
my
little
dove
shed
tears
too
,
and
Davers
was
moved
,
and
Miss
wiped
her
fine
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
what
became
of
the
naughty
boys
,
and
the
naughty
girl
,
mamma
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Became
of
them
!
<EOS>
Why
one
son
was
forced
to
go
to
sea
,
and
there
he
was
drowned
:
another
turned
thief
(
for
he
would
not
work
)
,
and
he
came
to
an
untimely
end
:
the
third
was
idle
and
ignorant
,
and
nobody
,
who
knew
how
he
used
his
poor
mother
,
would
employ
him
;
and
so
he
was
forced
to
go
into
a
far
country
,
and
beg
his
bread
.
<EOS>
And
the
naughty
girl
,
having
never
loved
work
,
pined
away
in
sloth
and
filthiness
,
and
at
last
broke
her
arm
,
and
died
of
a
fever
,
lamenting
,
too
late
,
that
she
had
been
so
wicked
a
daughter
to
so
good
a
mother
!
 
<EOS>
And
so
there
was
a
sad
end
to
all
the
four
ungracious
children
,
who
never
would
mind
what
their
poor
mother
said
to
them
;
and
God
punished
their
naughtiness
as
you
see
!
 
<EOS>
While
the
good
children
I
mentioned
before
,
were
the
glory
of
their
family
,
and
the
delight
of
every
body
that
knew
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Who
would
not
be
good
?
<EOS>
"
was
the
inference
:
and
the
repetition
from
Billy
,
with
his
hands
clapt
together
,
"
Poor
widow
woman
!
"
<EOS>
gave
me
much
pleasure
.
  
<EOS>
So
my
childish
story
ended
,
with
a
kiss
of
each
pretty
dear
,
and
their
thanks
for
my
story
:
and
then
came
on
Miss
's
request
for
a
woman
's
story
,
as
she
called
it
.
<EOS>
I
dismissed
my
babies
to
their
play
;
and
taking
Miss
's
hand
,
she
standing
before
me
,
all
attention
,
began
in
a
more
womanly
strain
to
her
;
for
she
is
very
fond
of
being
thought
a
woman
;
and
indeed
is
a
prudent
sensible
dear
,
comprehends
any
thing
instantly
,
and
makes
very
pretty
reflections
upon
what
she
hears
or
reads
as
you
will
observe
in
what
follows
:
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
nothing
,
my
dear
Miss
Goodwin
,
that
young
ladies
should
be
so
watchful
over
,
as
their
reputation
:
'
tis
a
tender
flower
that
the
least
frost
will
nip
,
the
least
cold
wind
will
blast
;
and
when
once
blasted
,
it
will
never
flourish
again
,
but
wither
to
the
very
root
.
<EOS>
But
this
I
have
told
you
so
often
,
I
need
not
repeat
what
I
have
said
.
<EOS>
So
to
my
story
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
were
four
pretty
ladies
lived
in
one
genteel
neighbourhood
,
daughters
of
four
several
families
;
but
all
companions
and
visitors
;
and
yet
all
of
very
different
inclinations
.
<EOS>
Coquetilla
we
will
call
one
,
Prudiana
another
,
Profusiana
the
third
,
and
Prudentia
the
fourth
;
their
several
names
denoting
their
respective
qualities
.
  
<EOS>
"
Coquetilla
was
the
only
daughter
of
a
worthy
baronet
,
by
a
lady
very
gay
,
but
rather
indiscreet
than
unvirtuous
,
who
took
not
the
requisite
care
of
her
daughter
's
education
,
but
let
her
be
over
-
run
with
the
love
of
fashion
,
dress
,
and
equipage
;
and
when
in
London
,
balls
,
operas
,
plays
,
the
Park
,
the
Ring
,
the
withdrawing
-
room
,
took
up
her
whole
attention
.
<EOS>
She
admired
nobody
but
herself
,
fluttered
about
,
laughing
at
,
and
despising
a
crowd
of
men
-
followers
,
whom
she
attracted
by
gay
,
thoughtless
freedoms
of
behaviour
,
too
nearly
treading
on
the
skirts
of
immodesty
:
yet
made
she
not
one
worthy
conquest
,
exciting
,
on
the
contrary
,
in
all
sober
minds
,
that
contempt
of
herself
,
which
she
so
profusely
would
be
thought
to
pour
down
upon
the
rest
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
After
she
had
several
years
fluttered
about
the
dangerous
light
,
like
some
silly
fly
,
she
at
last
singed
the
wings
of
her
reputation
;
for
,
being
despised
by
every
worthy
heart
,
she
became
too
easy
and
cheap
a
prey
to
a
man
the
most
unworthy
of
all
her
followers
,
who
had
resolution
and
confidence
enough
to
break
through
those
few
cobweb
reserves
,
in
which
she
had
encircled
her
precarious
virtue
;
and
which
were
no
longer
of
force
to
preserve
her
honour
,
when
she
met
with
a
man
more
bold
and
more
enterprising
than
herself
,
and
who
was
as
designing
as
she
was
thoughtless
.
<EOS>
And
what
then
became
of
Coquetilla?-Why
,
she
was
forced
to
pass
over
sea
to
Ireland
,
where
nobody
knew
her
,
and
to
bury
herself
in
a
dull
obscurity
;
to
go
by
another
name
,
and
at
last
,
unable
to
support
a
life
so
unsuitable
to
the
natural
gaiety
of
her
temper
,
she
pined
herself
into
a
consumption
,
and
died
,
unpitied
and
unlamented
,
among
strangers
,
having
not
one
friend
but
whom
she
bought
with
her
money
.
"

<EOS>
Poor
Lady
Coquetilla
!
"
said
Miss
Goodwin
;
"
what
a
sad
thing
it
is
to
have
a
wrong
education
;
and
how
happy
am
I
,
who
have
so
good
a
lady
to
supply
the
place
of
a
dear
distant
<EOS>
mamma!-But
be
pleased
,
Madam
,
to
proceed
to
the
next
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Prudiana
,
my
dear
,
was
the
daughter
of
a
gentleman
who
was
a
widower
,
and
had
,
while
the
young
lady
was
an
infant
,
buried
her
mamma
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
good
sort
of
man
;
but
had
but
one
lesson
to
teach
to
Prudiana
,
and
that
was
to
avoid
all
sort
of
conversation
with
the
men
;
but
never
gave
her
the
right
turn
of
mind
,
nor
instilled
into
it
that
sense
of
her
religious
duties
,
which
would
have
been
her
best
guard
in
all
temptations
.
<EOS>
For
,
provided
she
kept
out
of
the
sight
and
conversation
of
the
gentlemen
,
and
avoided
the
company
of
those
ladies
who
more
freely
conversed
with
the
other
sex
,
it
was
all
her
papa
desired
of
her
.
<EOS>
This
gave
her
a
haughty
,
sullen
,
and
reserved
turn
;
made
her
stiff
,
formal
,
and
affected
.
<EOS>
She
had
sense
enough
to
discover
early
the
faults
of
Coquetilla
,
and
,
in
dislike
to
them
,
fell
the
more
easily
into
that
contrary
extreme
,
which
a
recluse
education
,
and
her
papa
's
cautions
,
naturally
led
her
.
<EOS>
So
that
pride
,
reserve
,
affectation
,
and
censoriousness
,
made
up
the
essentials
of
her
character
,
and
she
became
more
unamiable
even
than
Coquetilla
;
and
as
the
other
was
too
accessible
,
Prudiana
was
quite
unapproachable
by
gentlemen
,
and
unfit
for
any
conversation
,
but
that
of
her
servants
,
being
also
deserted
by
those
of
her
own
sex
,
by
whom
she
might
have
improved
,
on
account
of
her
censorious
disposition
.
<EOS>
And
what
was
the
consequence
?
<EOS>
Why
this
:
every
worthy
person
of
both
sexes
despising
her
,
and
she
being
used
to
see
nobody
but
servants
,
at
last
throws
herself
upon
one
of
that
class
<EOS>
:
in
an
evil
hour
,
she
finds
something
that
is
taking
to
her
low
taste
in
the
person
of
her
papa
's
valet
,
a
wretch
so
infinitely
beneath
her
<EOS>
(
but
a
gay
coxcomb
of
a
servant
)
,
that
every
body
attributed
to
her
the
scandal
of
making
the
first
advances
;
for
,
otherwise
,
it
was
presumed
,
he
durst
not
have
looked
up
to
his
master
's
daughter
.
<EOS>
So
here
ended
all
her
pride
.
<EOS>
All
her
reserves
came
to
this
!
<EOS>
Her
censoriousness
of
others
redoubled
people
's
contempt
upon
herself
,
and
made
nobody
pity
her
.
<EOS>
She
was
finally
turned
out
of
doors
,
without
a
penny
of
fortune
:
the
fellow
was
forced
to
set
up
a
barber
's
shop
in
a
country
town
;
for
all
he
knew
was
to
shave
and
dress
a
peruke
:
and
her
papa
would
never
look
upon
her
more
:
so
that
Prudiana
became
the
outcast
of
her
family
,
and
the
scorn
of
all
that
knew
her
;
and
was
forced
to
mingle
in
conversation
and
company
with
the
wretches
of
her
husband
's
degree
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Poor
,
miserable
Prudiana
!
"
said
Miss
 
<EOS>
"
What
a
sad
,
sad
fall
was
hers
.
<EOS>
And
all
owing
to
the
want
of
a
proper
education
too
!
 
<EOS>
And
to
the
loss
of
such
a
mamma
,
as
I
have
an
aunt
;
and
so
wise
a
papa
as
I
have
an
uncle
!
 
<EOS>
How
could
her
papa
,
I
wonder
,
restrain
her
person
as
he
did
,
like
a
poor
nun
,
and
make
her
unacquainted
with
the
generous
restraints
of
the
mind
?
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
,
my
dear
good
aunt
,
it
will
be
owing
to
you
,
that
I
shall
never
be
a
Coquetilla
,
nor
a
Prudiana
neither
.
<EOS>
Your
table
is
always
surrounded
with
the
best
of
company
,
with
worthy
gentlemen
as
well
as
ladies
:
and
you
instruct
me
to
judge
of
both
,
and
of
every
new
guest
,
in
such
a
manner
,
as
makes
me
esteem
them
all
,
and
censure
nobody
;
but
yet
to
see
faults
in
some
to
avoid
,
and
graces
in
others
to
imitate
;
but
in
nobody
but
yourself
and
my
uncle
,
any
thing
so
like
perfection
,
as
shall
attract
one
's
admiration
to
one
's
own
ruin
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
young
,
yet
,
my
love
,
and
must
always
doubt
your
own
strength
;
and
pray
to
God
,
more
and
more
,
as
your
years
advance
,
to
give
you
more
and
more
prudence
,
and
watchfulness
over
your
conduct
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
yet
,
my
dear
,
you
must
think
justly
of
yourself
too
;
for
let
the
young
gentlemen
be
ever
so
learned
and
discreet
,
your
education
entitles
you
to
think
as
well
of
yourself
as
of
them
:
for
,
do
n't
you
see
,
the
ladies
who
are
so
kind
as
to
visit
us
,
that
have
not
been
abroad
,
as
you
have
been
,
when
they
were
young
,
yet
make
as
good
figures
in
conversation
,
<EOS>
say
as
good
things
as
any
of
the
gentlemen
?
<EOS>
For
,
my
dear
,
all
that
the
gentlemen
know
more
than
the
ladies
,
except
here
and
there
such
a
one
as
your
dear
uncle
,
with
all
their
learned
education
,
is
only
,
that
they
have
been
disciplined
,
perhaps
,
into
an
observation
of
a
few
accuracies
in
speech
,
which
,
if
they
know
no
more
,
rather
distinguish
the
pedant
than
the
gentleman
:
such
as
the
avoiding
of
a
false
concord
,
as
they
call
it
,
and
which
you
know
how
to
do
,
as
well
as
the
best
;
not
to
put
a
was
for
a
were
,
an
are
for
an
is
,
and
to
be
able
to
speak
in
mood
and
tense
,
and
such
like
valuable
parts
of
education
:
so
that
,
my
dear
,
you
can
have
no
reason
to
look
upon
that
sex
in
so
high
a
light
,
as
to
depreciate
your
own
:
<EOS>
and
yet
you
must
not
be
proud
nor
conceited
neither
;
but
make
this
one
rule
your
guide
:
  
"
<EOS>
In
your
maiden
state
,
think
yourself
above
the
gentlemen
,
and
they
'll
think
you
so
too
,
and
address
you
with
reverence
and
respect
,
if
they
see
there
be
neither
pride
nor
arrogance
in
your
behaviour
,
but
a
consciousness
of
merit
,
a
true
dignity
,
such
as
becomes
virgin
modesty
,
and
untainted
purity
of
mind
and
manners
,
like
that
of
an
angel
among
men
;
for
so
young
ladies
should
look
upon
themselves
to
be
,
and
will
then
be
treated
as
such
by
the
other
sex
.
  
<EOS>
"
In
your
married
state
,
which
is
a
kind
of
state
of
humiliation
for
a
lady
,
you
must
think
yourself
subordinate
to
your
husband
;
for
so
it
has
pleased
God
to
make
the
wife
.
<EOS>
You
must
have
no
will
of
your
own
,
in
petty
things
;
and
if
you
marry
a
gentleman
of
sense
and
honour
,
such
a
one
as
your
uncle
,
he
will
look
upon
you
as
his
equal
;
and
will
exalt
you
the
more
for
your
abasing
yourself
.
<EOS>
In
short
,
my
dear
,
he
will
act
by
you
,
just
as
your
dear
uncle
does
by
me
:
and
then
,
what
a
happy
creature
will
you
be
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
So
I
shall
,
Madam
!
<EOS>
To
be
sure
I
shall
!
 
<EOS>
But
I
know
I
shall
be
happy
whenever
I
marry
,
because
I
have
such
wise
directors
,
and
<EOS>
such
an
example
,
before
me
:
and
,
if
it
please
God
,
I
will
never
think
of
any
man
(
in
pursuance
of
your
constant
advice
to
young
ladies
at
the
tea
-
table
)
,
who
is
not
a
man
of
sense
,
and
a
virtuous
gentleman
.
<EOS>
But
now
,
dear
Madam
,
for
your
next
character
.
<EOS>
There
are
two
more
yet
to
come
,
that
's
my
pleasure
!
<EOS>
I
wish
there
were
ten
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
the
next
was
Profusiana
,
you
may
remember
,
my
love
.
<EOS>
Profusiana
took
another
course
to
her
ruin
.
<EOS>
She
fell
into
some
of
Coquetilla
's
foibles
,
but
pursued
them
for
another
end
,
and
in
another
manner
.
<EOS>
Struck
with
the
grandeur
and
magnificence
of
what
weak
people
call
the
upper
life
,
she
gives
herself
up
to
the
circus
,
to
balls
,
to
operas
,
to
masquerades
,
and
assemblies
;
affects
to
shine
at
the
head
of
all
companies
,
at
Tunbridge
,
at
Bath
,
and
every
place
of
public
resort
;
plays
high
,
is
always
receiving
and
paying
visits
,
giving
balls
,
and
making
treats
and
entertainments
;
and
is
so
much
above
the
conduct
which
mostly
recommends
a
young
lady
to
the
esteem
of
the
deserving
of
the
other
sex
,
that
no
gentleman
,
who
prefers
solid
happiness
,
can
think
of
addressing
her
,
though
she
is
a
fine
person
,
and
has
many
outward
graces
of
behaviour
.
<EOS>
She
becomes
the
favourite
toast
of
the
place
she
frequents
,
is
proud
of
that
distinction
;
gives
the
fashion
,
and
delights
in
the
pride
,
that
she
can
make
apes
in
imitation
,
whenever
she
pleases
.
<EOS>
But
yet
endeavouring
to
avoid
being
thought
proud
,
makes
herself
cheap
,
and
is
the
subject
of
the
attempts
of
every
coxcomb
of
eminence
;
and
with
much
ado
,
preserves
her
virtue
,
though
not
her
character
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
,
all
this
while
,
is
poor
Profusiana
doing
?
<EOS>
She
would
be
glad
,
perhaps
,
of
a
suitable
proposal
,
and
would
,
it
may
be
,
give
up
some
of
her
gaieties
and
extravagances
:
for
Profusiana
has
wit
,
and
is
not
totally
destitute
of
reason
,
when
she
suffers
herself
to
think
.
<EOS>
But
her
conduct
procures
her
not
one
solid
friendship
,
and
she
has
not
in
a
twelvemonth
,
among
a
thousand
professions
of
service
,
one
devoir
that
she
can
attend
to
,
or
a
friend
that
she
can
depend
upon
.
<EOS>
All
the
women
she
sees
,
if
she
excels
them
,
hate
her
:
the
gay
part
of
the
men
,
with
whom
she
accompanies
most
,
are
all
in
a
plot
against
her
honour
.
<EOS>
Even
the
gentlemen
,
whose
conduct
in
the
general
is
governed
by
principles
of
virtue
,
come
down
to
these
public
places
to
partake
of
the
innocent
freedoms
allowed
there
,
and
oftentimes
give
themselves
airs
of
gallantry
,
and
never
have
it
in
their
thoughts
to
commence
a
treaty
of
marriage
with
an
acquaintance
begun
upon
that
gay
spot
.
<EOS>
What
solid
friendships
and
satisfactions
then
is
Profusiana
excluded
from
!
  
<EOS>
"
Her
name
indeed
is
written
in
every
public
window
,
and
prostituted
,
as
I
may
call
it
,
at
the
pleasure
of
every
profligate
or
sot
,
who
wears
a
diamond
to
engrave
it
:
and
that
it
may
be
,
with
most
vile
and
barbarous
imputations
and
freedoms
of
words
,
added
by
rakes
,
who
very
probably
never
exchanged
a
syllable
with
her
.
<EOS>
The
wounded
trees
are
perhaps
also
taught
to
wear
the
initials
of
her
name
,
linked
,
not
unlikely
,
and
widening
as
they
grow
,
with
those
of
a
scoundrel
.
<EOS>
But
all
this
while
she
makes
not
the
least
impression
upon
one
noble
heart
:
and
at
last
,
perhaps
,
having
run
on
to
the
end
of
an
uninterrupted
race
of
follies
,
she
is
cheated
into
the
arms
of
some
vile
fortune
-
hunter
;
who
quickly
lavishes
away
the
remains
of
that
fortune
which
her
extravagance
had
left
;
and
then
,
after
the
worst
usage
,
abandoning
her
with
contempt
,
she
sinks
into
an
obscurity
that
cuts
short
the
thread
of
her
life
,
and
leaves
no
remembrance
,
but
on
the
brittle
glass
,
and
still
more
faithless
bark
,
that
ever
she
had
a
being
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Alas
,
alas
!
<EOS>
what
a
butterfly
of
a
day
,
"
said
Miss
(
an
expression
she
remembered
of
Lady
Towers
)
,
"
was
poor
Profusiana
!
 
<EOS>
What
a
sad
thing
to
be
so
dazzled
by
worldly
grandeur
,
and
to
have
so
many
admirers
,
and
not
one
real
friend
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
true
,
my
dear
;
and
how
carefully
ought
a
person
of
a
gay
and
lively
temper
to
watch
over
it
I
<EOS>
And
what
a
rock
may
public
places
be
to
a
lady
's
reputation
,
if
she
be
not
doubly
vigilant
in
her
conduct
,
when
she
is
exposed
to
the
censures
and
observations
of
malignant
crowds
of
people
;
many
of
the
worst
of
whom
spare
the
least
those
who
are
most
unlike
themselves
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
But
then
,
Madam
,
"
said
Miss
,
"
would
Profusiana
venture
to
play
at
public
places
?
<EOS>
Will
ladies
game
,
Madam
?
<EOS>
I
have
heard
you
say
,
<EOS>
that
lords
,
and
sharpers
but
just
out
of
liveries
,
in
gaming
,
are
upon
a
foot
in
every
thing
,
save
that
one
has
nothing
to
lose
,
and
the
other
much
,
besides
his
reputation
!
<EOS>
And
will
ladies
so
disgrace
their
characters
,
and
their
sex
,
as
to
pursue
this
pernicious
diversion
in
public
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
my
dear
,
they
will
too
often
,
the
more
's
the
pity
!
<EOS>
And
do
n't
you
remember
,
when
we
were
at
Bath
,
in
what
a
hurry
I
once
passed
by
some
knots
of
genteel
people
,
and
you
asked
what
those
were
doing
?
<EOS>
I
told
you
,
whisperingly
,
they
were
gaming
;
and
loath
I
was
,
that
my
Miss
Goodwin
should
stop
to
see
some
sights
,
to
which
,
till
she
arrived
at
the
years
of
discretion
,
it
was
not
proper
to
familiarize
her
eye
;
in
some
sort
acting
like
the
ancient
Romans
,
who
would
not
assign
punishments
to
certain
atrocious
crimes
,
because
they
had
such
an
high
idea
of
human
nature
,
as
to
suppose
it
incapable
of
committing
them
;
so
I
was
not
for
having
you
,
while
a
little
girl
,
see
those
things
,
which
I
knew
would
give
no
credit
to
our
sex
,
and
<EOS>
which
I
thought
,
when
you
grew
older
,
should
be
new
and
shocking
to
you
:
<EOS>
but
now
you
are
so
much
a
woman
in
discretion
,
I
may
tell
you
any
thing
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
kissed
my
hand
,
and
made
me
a
fine
curtsey
-
and
told
me
,
that
now
she
longed
to
hear
of
Prudentia
's
conduct
.
"
<EOS>
Her
name
,
Madam
,
"
said
she
,
"
promises
better
things
than
those
of
her
three
companions
;
and
so
it
had
need
:
for
how
sad
is
it
to
think
,
that
out
of
four
ladies
of
distinction
,
three
of
them
should
be
naughty
,
and
,
of
course
,
unhappy
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
These
two
words
,
of
course
,
my
dear
,
"
said
I
,
"
were
very
prettily
put
in
:
let
me
kiss
you
for
it
:
since
every
one
that
is
naughty
,
first
or
last
,
must
be
certainly
unhappy
.
  
<EOS>
"
Far
otherwise
than
what
I
have
related
,
was
it
with
the
amiable
Prudentia
.
<EOS>
Like
the
industrious
bee
,
she
makes
up
her
honey
-
hoard
from
every
flower
,
bitter
as
well
as
sweet
;
for
every
character
is
of
use
to
her
,
by
which
she
can
improve
her
own
.
<EOS>
She
had
the
happiness
of
an
aunt
,
who
loved
her
,
as
I
do
you
;
and
of
an
uncle
who
doated
on
her
,
as
yours
does
:
for
,
alas
!
<EOS>
poor
Prudentia
lost
her
papa
and
mamma
almost
in
her
infancy
,
in
one
week
:
but
was
so
happy
in
her
uncle
and
aunt
's
care
,
as
not
to
miss
them
in
her
education
,
and
but
just
to
remember
their
persons
.
<EOS>
By
reading
,
by
observation
,
and
by
attention
,
she
daily
added
new
advantages
to
those
which
her
education
gave
her
.
<EOS>
She
saw
,
and
pitied
,
the
fluttering
freedoms
and
dangerous
nights
of
Coquetilla
.
<EOS>
The
sullen
pride
,
the
affectation
,
and
stiff
reserves
,
which
Prudiana
assumed
,
she
penetrated
,
and
made
it
her
study
to
avoid
.
<EOS>
And
the
gay
,
hazardous
conduct
,
extravagant
temper
,
and
love
of
tinselled
grandeur
,
which
were
the
blemishes
of
Profusiana
's
character
,
she
dreaded
and
shunned
.
<EOS>
She
fortifies
herself
with
the
excellent
examples
of
the
past
and
present
ages
,
and
knows
how
to
avoid
the
faults
of
the
faulty
,
and
to
imitate
the
graces
of
the
most
perfect
.
<EOS>
She
takes
into
her
scheme
of
that
future
happiness
,
which
she
hopes
to
make
her
own
,
what
are
the
true
excellencies
of
her
sex
,
and
endeavours
to
appropriate
to
herself
the
domestic
virtues
,
which
shall
one
day
make
her
the
crown
of
some
worthy
gentleman
's
earthly
happiness
:
and
which
,
of
course
,
as
you
prettily
said
,
my
dear
,
will
secure
and
heighten
her
own
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
noble
frankness
of
disposition
,
that
sweet
and
unaffected
openness
and
simplicity
,
which
shines
in
all
her
actions
and
behaviour
,
commend
her
to
the
esteem
and
reverence
of
all
mankind
;
as
her
humility
and
affability
,
and
a
temper
uncensorious
,
and
ever
making
the
best
of
what
she
said
of
the
absent
person
,
of
either
sex
,
do
to
the
love
of
every
lady
.
<EOS>
Her
name
,
indeed
,
is
not
prostituted
on
windows
,
nor
carved
on
the
barks
of
trees
in
public
places
:
but
it
smells
sweet
to
every
nostril
,
dwells
on
every
tongue
,
and
is
engraven
on
every
heart
.
<EOS>
She
meets
with
no
address
but
from
men
of
honour
and
probity
:
the
fluttering
coxcomb
,
the
inveigling
parasite
,
the
insidious
deceiver
,
the
mercenary
fortune
-
hunter
,
spread
no
snares
for
a
heart
guarded
by
discretion
and
prudence
,
as
hers
is
.
<EOS>
They
see
,
that
all
her
amiable
virtues
are
the
happy
result
of
an
uniform
judgment
,
and
the
effects
of
her
own
wisdom
,
founded
in
an
education
to
which
she
does
the
highest
credit
.
<EOS>
And
at
last
,
after
several
worthy
offers
,
enough
to
perplex
a
lady
's
choice
,
she
blesses
some
one
happy
gentleman
,
more
distinguished
than
the
rest
,
for
learning
,
good
sense
,
and
true
politeness
,
which
is
but
another
word
for
virtue
and
honour
;
and
shines
,
to
her
last
hour
,
in
all
the
duties
of
domestic
life
,
as
an
excellent
wife
,
mother
,
mistress
,
friend
,
and
Christian
;
and
so
confirms
all
the
expectations
of
which
her
maiden
life
had
given
such
strong
and
such
edifying
presages
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Then
folding
my
dear
Miss
in
my
arms
,
and
kissing
her
,
tears
of
pleasure
standing
in
her
pretty
eyes
,
<EOS>
"
Who
would
not
,
"
said
I
,
"
shun
the
examples
of
the
Coquetilla

,
the
Prudiana

<EOS>
And
so
,
my
dear
Lady
G.

you
have
some
of
my
nursery
tales

relying

CONCLUSION
  
<EOS>
The
Editor
thinks
proper
to
conclude
in
this
place
,
that
he
may
not
be
thought
to
deserve
a
suspicion
,
that
the
extent
of
the
work
was
to
be
measured
by
the
patience
of
its
readers
.
<EOS>
But
he
thinks
it
necessary
,
in
order
to
elucidate
the
whole
,
to
subjoin
a
note
of
the
following
facts
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
(
after
the
affair
which
took
date
at
the
masquerade
,
and
concluded
so
happily
)
continued
to
be
one
of
the
best
and
most
exemplary
of
men
,
an
honour
to
his
country
,
both
in
his
public
and
private
capacity
;
having
,
at
the
instances
of
some
of
his
friends
in
very
elevated
stations
,
accepted
of
an
honourable
employment
abroad
in
the
service
of
the
state
;
which
he
discharged
in
such
a
manner
,
as
might
be
expected
from
his
qualifications
and
knowledge
of
the
world
:
and
on
his
return
,
after
an
absence
of
three
years
,
resisting
all
the
temptations
of
ambition
,
devoted
himself
to
private
duties
,
and
joined
with
his
excellent
lady
in
every
pious
wish
of
her
heart
;
adorning
the
married
life
with
all
the
warmth
of
an
elegant
tenderness
;
beloved
by
his
tenants
,
respected
by
his
neighbours
,
revered
by
his
children
,
and
almost
adored
by
the
poor
,
in
every
county
where
his
estates
gave
him
interest
,
as
well
for
his
own
bountiful
temper
,
as
for
the
charities
he
permitted
to
be
dispensed
,
with
so
liberal
a
hand
,
by
his
lady
.
  
<EOS>
She
made
him
the
father
of
seven
fine
children
,
five
sons
,
and
two
daughters
,
all
adorned
and
accomplished
by
nature
,
to
be
the
joy
and
delight
of
such
parents
;
being
educated
,
in
every
respect
,
by
the
rules
of
their
inimitable
mother
,
laid
down
in
that
book
which
she
mentions
to
have
been
written
by
her
for
the
revisal
and
correction
of
her
consort
;
the
contents
of
which
may
be
gathered
from
her
remarks
upon
Mr.
Locke
's
Treatise
on
Education
,
in
her
letters
to
Mr.
B.
,
and
in
those
to
Lady
G.
  
Miss
GOODWIN
,
at
the
age
of
eighteen
,
was
married
to
a
young
gentleman
of
fine
parts
,
and
great
sobriety
and
virtue
:
and
both
she
and
he
,
in
every
material
part
of
their
conduct
,
and
in
their
behaviour
to
one
another
,
emulate
the
good
example
set
them
by
Mr.
and
Mrs.
B.
  
Lord
DAVERS
dying
two
years
before
this
marriage
,
his
lady
went
to
reside
at
the
Hall
in
Lincolnshire
,
the
place
of
her
birth
,
that
she
might
enjoy
the
company
and
conversation
of
her
excellent
sister
;
who
,
for
conveniency
of
the
chapel
,
and
advantage
of
room
and
situation
,
had
prevailed
upon
Mr.
B.
to
make
it
the
chief
place
of
his
residence
;
and
there
the
noble
lady
lived
long
(
in
the
strictest
friendship
with
the
happy
pair
)
an
honourable
relict
of
her
affectionate
lord
.
  
<EOS>
The
worthy
Mr.
ANDREWS
,
and
his
wife
,
lived
together
in
the
sweet
tranquillity
set
forth
in
their
letters
,
for
the
space
of
twelve
years
,
at
the
Kentish
farm
:
the
good
old
gentlewoman
died
first
,
full
of
years
and
comfort
,
her
dutiful
daughter
performing
the
last
pious
offices
to
so
beloved
and
so
loving
a
parent

her
husband
survived
her
about
a
year
only
.

Lady
G.

Miss
DARNFORD
that
was
,
after
a
happy
marriage
of
several
years
,
died
in
child
-
bed
of
her
fourth
child

to
the
inexpressible
concern
of
her
affectionate
consort
,
and
of
her
dear
friend
Mrs.
B.
  
Lord
H.
,
after
having
suffered
great
dishonour
by
the
ill
courses
of
his
wife
,
and
great
devastations
in
his
estate
,
through
her
former
debts
,
and
continued
extravagance
(
intimidated
and
dispirited
by
her
perpetual
insults
,
and
those
of
her
gaming
brother
,
who
with
his
bullying
friends
,
terrified
him
into
their
measures
)
,
threw
himself
upon
the
protection
of
Mr.
B.
who
,
by
his
spirit
and
prudence
,
saved
him
from
utter
ruin
,
punished
his
wife
's
accomplices
,
and
obliged
her
to
accept
a
separate
maintenance
;
and
then
taking
his
affairs
into
his
own
management
,
in
due
course
of
time
,
entirely
re
-
established
them
:
and
after
some
years
his
wife
dying
,
he
became
wiser
by
his
past
sufferings
,
and
married
a
second
,
of
Lady
Davers
's
recommendation
,
who
,
by
her
prudence
and
virtue
,
made
him
happy
for

<EOS>
Mr.
LONGMAN
lived
to
a
great
age
in
the
worthy
family
,
much
esteemed
by
every
one
,
having
trained
up
a
diligent
youth
,
whom
he
had
recommended
,
to
ease
him
in
his
business
,
and
who
,
answering
expectation
,
succeeded
him
in
it
after
his
death
.
  
<EOS>
He
dying
rich
,
out
of
his
great
love
and
gratitude
to
the
family
,
in
whose
service
he
had
acquired
most
of
his
fortune
,
and
in
disgust
to
his
nearest
relations
,
who
had
perversely
disobliged
him
;
he
bequeathed
to
three
of
them
one
hundred
pounds
a
-
piece
,
and
left
all
the
rest
to
his
honoured
principal
,
Mr.
B.
;
who
,
as
soon
as
he
came
to
know
it
,
being
at
that
time
abroad
,
directed
his
lady
to
call
together
the
relations
of
the
old
gentleman
,
and
,
after
touching
them
to
the
heart
with
a
just
and
effectual
reproof
,
and
finding
them
filled
with
due
sense
of
their
demerit
,
which
had
been
the
cause
of
their
suffering
,
then
to
divide
the
whole
,
which
had
been
left
him
,
among
them
,
in
greater
proportions
as
they
were
more
nearly
related
:
an
action
worthy
prayers
and
blessings
,
not
only
of
the
benefited
,
but
all
who
heard
of
it
.
<EOS>
For
it
is
easy
to
imagine
,
how
cheerfully
,
and
how
gracefully
,
his
benevolent
lady
discharged
a
command
so
well
suited
to
her
natural
generosity
.
