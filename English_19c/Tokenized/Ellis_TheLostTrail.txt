CHAPTER
I.
AN
ENEMY
IN
A
TREEOne
afternoon
in
early
spring
,
Jack
Carleton
,
a
sturdy
youth
of
seventeen
years
,
was
following
a
clearly
-
marked
trail
,
leading
through
the
western
part
of
Kentucky
toward
the
Mississippi
river
.
<EOS>
For
many
a
mile
he
followed
the
evenly
spaced
tracks
made
by
a
horse
on
a
walk
,
the
double
impressions
being
a
trifle
more
than
three
feet
apart
.
<EOS>
“Helloa
!
”
<EOS>
exclaimed
,
Jack
,
when
he
looked
at
the
earth
again
and
observed
that
the
tracks
had
taken
a
new
form
,
with
nearly
eight
feet
between
them
.
<EOS>
“
Otto
has
forced
the
colt
to
a
trot
.
<EOS>
He
must
be
in
a
hurry
,
or
he
thinks
I
am
fond
of
traveling
.
<EOS>
”Thus
<EOS>
far
the
lusty
young
Kentuckian
felt
no
misgiving
,
but
within
fifty
yards
the
trail
underwent
the
startling
change
—
the
footprints
being
separated
by
more
than
three
yards
now
.
<EOS>
“My
<EOS>
gracious
<EOS>
,
”
muttered
the
boy
,
coming
to
a
full
stop
,
“
something
is
wrong
:
Otto
would
not
have
put
the
horse
on
a
dead
run
if
he
had
n't
been
scared
.
<EOS>
”Jack
<EOS>
Carleton
proved
his
training
by
the
keenness
and
quickness
with
which
he
surveyed
his
surroundings
.
<EOS>
The
woods
were
on
every
hand
,
but
they
were
open
and
free
from
undergrowth
,
so
that
he
gained
an
extensive
view
.
<EOS>
As
he
advanced
with
vigorous
steps
along
the
winding
path
,
his
eyes
sometimes
rested
on
the
pendulous
branches
of
the
majestic
elm
,
a
small
purple
flower
here
and
there
still
clinging
to
the
limbs
and
resisting
the
budding
leaves
striving
to
force
it
aside
;
the
massive
oak
and
its
twisted
,
iron
limbs
;
the
pinnated
leaves
of
the
hickory
,
whose
solid
trunk
,
when
gashed
by
the
axe
,
was
of
snowy
whiteness
;
the
pale
green
spikes
and
tiny
flowers
of
the
chestnut
;
the
sycamore
,
whose
spreading
limbs
found
themselves
crowded
even
in
the
most
open
spaces
,
with
an
occasional
wild
cherry
or
tulip
,
and
now
and
then
a
pine
,
whose
resinous
breath
brooded
like
a
perennial
balm
over
the
vast
solitude
.
<EOS>
Jack
Carleton
was
arrayed
in
the
coarse
,
serviceable
garb
of
the
border
:
heavy
calf
-
skin
shoes
,
thick
trousers
,
leggings
and
coat
,
the
latter
short
and
clasped
at
the
waist
by
a
girdle
,
also
of
woolen
and
similar
to
that
of
the
modern
ulster
.
<EOS>
The
cap
was
of
the
same
material
and
,
like
the
other
garments
,
had
been
fashioned
and
put
together
by
the
deft
hands
of
the
mother
in
Kentucky
.
<EOS>
Powder
-
horn
and
bullet
-
pouch
were
suspended
by
strings
passing
over
alternate
sides
of
the
neck
and
a
fine
flint
-
lock
rifle
,
the
inseparable
companion
of
the
Western
youth
,
rested
on
the
right
shoulder
,
the
hand
grasping
it
near
the
stock
.
<EOS>
Jack
's
hasty
survey
failed
to
reveal
any
cause
for
fear
,
and
he
resumed
his
pursuit
,
as
it
may
be
termed
.
<EOS>
The
quick
glances
he
cast
on
the
ground
in
front
showed
,
in
every
instance
,
that
the
horse
he
was
following
was
fleeing
at
the
same
headlong
pace
.
<EOS>
His
rider
had
spurred
him
to
a
dead
run
,
at
which
gait
he
had
shot
underneath
the
limbs
of
the
trees
at
great
risk
to
himself
as
well
as
to
his
rider
.
<EOS>
The
trail
was
broad
,
for
loaded
horses
had
passed
in
both
directions
,
and
wild
animals
availed
themselves
of
it
more
than
once
in
making
their
pilgrimages
to
the
Mississippi
,
or
in
migrating
from
one
part
of
the
country
to
the
other
.
<EOS>
But
there
were
no
footprints
that
had
been
made
within
the
past
few
days
,
with
the
single
exception
noted
—
that
of
the
horse
which
had
abruptly
broken
into
a
full
run
.
<EOS>
The
balmy
afternoon
was
drawing
to
a
close
,
and
Jack
began
to
believe
the
chances
were
against
overtaking
his
friend
and
companion
,
young
Otto
Relstaub
.
<EOS>
“If
<EOS>
he
has
kept
this
up
very
long
,
he
must
be
far
beyond
my
reach
,
unless
he
has
turned
about
and
taken
the
back
trail
.
<EOS>
”Glancing
<EOS>
at
the
sky
as
seen
through
the
branches
overhead
,
the
youth
observed
that
it
was
clear
,
the
deep
blue
flecked
here
and
there
by
patches
of
snowy
clouds
,
resting
motionless
in
the
crystalline
air
.
<EOS>
Comparatively
young
as
was
Jack
,
he
had
been
thoroughly
trained
in
woodcraft
.
<EOS>
When
beyond
sight
of
the
cabins
of
the
straggling
settlement
,
where
he
made
his
home
,
he
was
as
watchful
and
alert
as
Daniel
Boone
or
Simon
Kenton
himself
.
<EOS>
His
penetrating
gray
eyes
not
only
scanned
the
sinuous
path
,
stretching
in
front
,
but
darted
from
side
to
side
,
and
were
frequently
turned
behind
him
.
<EOS>
He
knew
that
if
danger
threatened
it
was
as
likely
to
come
from
one
point
as
another
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
avoid
one
conclusion
:
the
peril
which
had
impelled
the
young
German
's
horse
to
such
a
burst
of
speed
must
have
been
in
the
form
dreaded
above
all
others
—
that
of
the
wild
Indians
who
at
that
day
roamed
through
the
vast
wilderness
of
the
West
and
hovered
along
the
frontier
,
eager
to
use
the
torch
,
the
rifle
,
or
the
tomahawk
,
whenever
and
wherever
the
way
opened
.
<EOS>
The
probability
that
such
was
the
cause
of
the
horseman
's
haste
threw
the
young
Kentuckian
at
once
on
his
mettle
.
<EOS>
Inasmuch
as
he
was
putting
forth
every
effort
to
rejoin
his
companion
,
there
was
good
reason
for
fearing
a
collision
with
the
red
men
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
in
several
desperate
affrays
with
them
,
and
,
like
a
sensible
person
,
he
spared
no
exertion
to
escape
all
such
encounters
.
<EOS>
“If
<EOS>
they
will
let
me
alone
<EOS>
I
will
not
disturb
them
,
”
was
the
principle
which
not
only
he
,
but
many
of
the
bravest
frontiersmen
followed
daring
the
eventful
early
days
of
the
West
.
<EOS>
The
youth
now
dropped
into
the
loping
trot
of
the
American
Indian
—
a
gait
which
,
as
in
the
case
of
the
dusky
warrior
himself
,
he
was
able
to
maintain
hour
after
hour
,
without
fatigue
.
<EOS>
The
sharp
glances
thrown
in
every
direction
were
not
long
in
making
a
discovery
,
though
not
of
the
nature
anticipated
.
<EOS>
A
short
distance
in
front
a
white
oak
,
whose
trunk
was
fully
two
feet
in
diameter
,
grew
beside
the
trail
which
he
was
following
.
<EOS>
Its
shaggy
limbs
twisted
their
way
across
the
path
and
among
the
branches
on
the
other
side
.
<EOS>
The
exuberant
leaves
offered
such
inviting
concealment
to
man
and
animal
that
the
youth
subjected
them
to
the
keenest
scrutiny
.
<EOS>
His
trot
dropped
to
a
slow
walk
,
and
he
instinctively
glanced
at
the
lock
of
his
gun
to
make
sure
it
was
ready
for
any
emergency
.
<EOS>
Something
was
moving
among
the
branches
of
the
forest
monarch
,
but
Jack
knew
it
was
not
an
Indian
.
<EOS>
No
warrior
would
climb
into
a
tree
to
wait
for
his
prey
,
when
,
he
could
secure
better
concealment
on
the
ground
,
where
he
would
not
be
compelled
to
yield
the
use
of
his
legs
,
which
play
such
an
important
part
in
the
maneuverings
of
the
red
man
.
<EOS>
The
lad
caught
several
glimpses
of
the
strange
animal
,
and
,
when
within
a
few
rods
,
identified
it
.
<EOS>
“It
's
a
painter
,
”
he
said
to
himself
,
with
a
faint
smile
,
resuming
his
slow
advance
and
giving
a
sigh
of
relief
;
“
I
do
n't
know
whether
it
is
worth
while
to
give
him
a
shot
or
not
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
name
“
painter
,
”
so
common
among
American
hunters
,
is
a
corruption
of
“
panther
,
”
which
is
itself
an
incorrect
application
,
the
genuine
panther
being
found
only
in
Africa
and
India
.
<EOS>
In
South
America
the
corresponding
animal
is
the
jaguar
,
and
in
North
America
the
cougar
or
catamount
,
and
sometimes
the
American
lion
.
<EOS>
Jack
Carlton
did
not
hold
the
brute
in
special
fear
,
though
he
knew
that
when
wounded
or
impelled
by
hunger
he
was
a
dangerous
foe
.
<EOS>
During
an
unusually
cold
day
,
only
a
few
months
before
,
one
of
them
had
made
an
open
attack
on
him
,
inflicting
some
severe
scratches
and
tearing
most
of
his
clothes
to
shreds
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
been
one
of
the
easiest
things
in
the
world
for
the
young
Kentuckian
to
settle
the
whole
question
by
leaving
the
trail
and
making
a
detour
that
would
take
him
safely
by
the
treacherous
beast
,
which
,
as
a
rule
,
is
afraid
to
assault
a
person
.
<EOS>
The
lad
was
certain
that
at
that
season
of
the
year
it
would
not
leave
the
tree
to
attack
him
.
<EOS>
But
if
he
took
such
a
course
,
it
would
be
a
confession
of
timidity
on
his
part
against
which
,
his
nature
and
training
rebelled
.
<EOS>
“No
<EOS>
,
”
Said
he
,
after
brief
hesitation
,
“
I
wo
n't
leave
the
path
for
all
the
painters
this
side
of
the
Mississippi
.
<EOS>
It
may
not
be
wise
for
me
to
fire
my
gun
just
now
<EOS>
and
I
wo
n't
do
it
,
if
he
behaves
himself
,
but
<EOS>
I
do
n't
mean
to
put
up
with
any
nonsense
.
<EOS>
”He
<EOS>
brought
his
weapon
in
front
,
raised
the
hammer
and
closely
watched
the
animal
above
,
while
the
quadruped
was
equally
intent
in
observing
him
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
curious
sight
—
the
two
scrutinizing
each
other
with
such
defiant
distrust
.
<EOS>
The
cougar
was
crouching
on
a
broad
limb
,
just
far
enough
from
the
trunk
of
the
oak
to
be
directly
over
the
trail
.
<EOS>
He
was
extended
full
length
,
and
,
as
partly
seen
through
the
leaves
,
offered
the
best
target
possible
for
the
marksman
below
.
<EOS>
But
Jack
preferred
not
to
fire
his
gun
,
for
the
reason
that
the
report
was
likely
to
be
heard
by
more
dangerous
enemies
.
<EOS>
His
purpose
was
to
refrain
from
doing
so
,
unless
forced
to
shoot
in
self
defense
,
and
his
pride
would
not
permit
him
to
deviate
a
hair's
-
breadth
from
the
path
in
order
to
escape
the
necessity
of
shooting
.
<EOS>
He
walked
with
the
deliberate
,
noiseless
tread
of
an
Indian
,
looking
steadily
upward
at
the
eyes
which
assumed
a
curious
,
phosphorescent
glare
,
that
scintillated
with
a
greenish
light
,
as
the
relative
position
of
the
enemies
changed
.
<EOS>
The
lad
passed
under
the
limbs
staring
unflinchingly
aloft
.
<EOS>
When
exactly
beneath
,
the
cougar
was
hidden
for
an
instant
from
sight
,
but
,
recognizing
the
changing
conditions
,
he
quickly
lifted
his
head
to
the
right
,
and
the
lad
again
saw
the
greenish
glare
,
the
white
teeth
,
and
blood
red
mouth
.
<EOS>
He
traced
the
outlines
of
the
sinewy
body
close
along
the
limb
,
and
through
which
he
could
have
driven
a
bullet
with
fatal
certainty
.
<EOS>
The
“
painter
,
”
whose
scream
is
often
mistaken
for
the
cry
of
a
human
being
,
uttered
an
occasional
snarling
growl
as
he
looked
down
on
the
lad
.
<EOS>
His
attitude
and
manner
seemed
to
say
:
“
I
've
got
my
eye
on
you
,
young
man
!
<EOS>
Walk
very
straight
or
you
will
find
yourself
in
trouble
.
<EOS>
”The
probability
that
a
cougar
is
gathering
his
muscles
on
a
limb
with
the
intention
of
bounding
down
on
one
's
shoulders
,
is
enough
to
make
the
bravest
man
uneasy
.
<EOS>
Jack
Carleton
did
feel
a
creeping
chill
,
but
the
same
pride
which
prevented
him
deviating
a
hair's
-
breadth
from
the
trail
,
would
not
allow
him
to
increase
or
retard
his
gait
.
<EOS>
“If
<EOS>
you
think
you
can
make
me
run
,
old
fellow
,
”
he
muttered
,
with
his
gaze
still
fixed
on
the
beast
,
“
you
are
mistaken
.
<EOS>
We
do
n't
meet
wild
animals
in
Kentucky
that
are
able
to
drive
us
out
of
the
woods
.
<EOS>
You
need
n't
fancy
,
either
,
that
I
am
in
any
hurry
to
walk
away
from
you
.
<EOS>
”And
<EOS>
,
to
show
the
contempt
in
which
he
held
the
beast
,
the
youth
at
that
moment
came
to
a
full
stop
,
turned
about
and
faced
him
.

CHAPTER
II
.
<EOS>
WHAT
A
RIFLE
-
SHOT
<EOS>
DIDThe
moment
the
young
Kentuckian
assumed
this
attitude
,
he
became
aware
that
the
cougar
had
determined
upon
hostilities
.
<EOS>
With
a
rasping
snarl
he
buried
his
claws
in
the
shaggy
bark
,
pressing
his
body
still
closer
to
the
limb
,
and
then
shot
downward
straight
toward
Jack
,
who
was
too
vigilant
to
be
caught
unprepared
.
<EOS>
Leaping
backward
a
couple
of
steps
,
he
brought
his
gun
to
his
shoulder
,
like
a
flash
,
and
fired
almost
at
the
moment
the
animal
left
his
perch
.
<EOS>
There
could
be
no
miss
under
the
circumstances
,
and
the
“
painter
"
received
his
death
wound
,
as
may
be
said
,
while
in
mid
-
air
.
<EOS>
He
struck
the
ground
with
a
heavy
thump
,
made
a
blind
leap
toward
the
youthful
hunter
,
who
recoiled
several
steps
more
,
and
then
,
after
a
brief
struggle
,
the
beast
lay
dead
.
<EOS>
During
these
moments
,
Jack
Carleton
,
following
the
rule
he
was
taught
when
first
given
his
gun
,
occupied
himself
with
reloading
the
weapon
.
<EOS>
A
charge
of
powder
was
poured
from
the
hollow
cow
's
horn
,
with
its
wooden
stopper
,
into
the
palm
of
his
hand
,
and
this
went
rattling
like
fine
sand
down
the
barrel
.
<EOS>
The
square
piece
of
muslin
was
hammered
on
top
until
the
ramrod
almost
bounded
from
the
gun
;
then
the
bullet
which
the
youthful
hunter
had
molded
himself
,
was
shoved
gently
but
firmly
downward
,
backed
by
another
bit
of
muslin
.
<EOS>
The
ramrod
was
pushed
into
its
place
,
and
the
hammer
,
clasping
the
yellow
,
translucent
flint
,
was
drawn
far
back
,
like
the
jaw
of
a
wild
cat
,
and
the
black
grains
sprinkled
into
the
pan
.
<EOS>
The
jaw
was
slowly
let
back
so
as
to
hold
the
priming
fast
,
and
the
old
fashioned
rifle
,
such
as
our
grandfathers
were
accustomed
to
use
,
was
ready
for
duty
.
<EOS>
Jack
surveyed
the
motionless
figure
on
the
ground
and
said:“I
do
n't
think
you
'll
ever
amount
to
anything
again
as
a
painter
;
at
any
rate
,
you
ai
n't
likely
to
drop
on
to
a
fellow
's
head
when
he
is
walking
under
a
tree
.
<EOS>
”And
<EOS>
,
without
giving
him
any
further
notice
,
he
turned
about
and
resumed
his
walk
toward
the
Mississippi
.
<EOS>
It
was
vain
,
however
,
for
him
to
seek
to
suppress
his
anxiety
.
<EOS>
The
trail
of
the
flying
horse
still
indicated
that
he
was
going
on
a
dead
run
,
and
some
unusual
cause
must
have
impelled
him
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
Jack
could
not
doubt
that
his
friend
Otto
was
driven
to
such
severe
effort
by
the
appearance
of
Indians
,
but
it
would
seem
that
the
terrific
gait
of
the
Steed
ought
to
have
taken
him
beyond
all
danger
very
speedily
,
whereas
,
for
more
than
a
mile
,
the
pace
showed
not
the
slightest
diminution
.
<EOS>
At
the
most
,
Otto
was
not
more
than
an
hour
in
advance
,
and
his
friend
,
therefore
,
had
good
reason
to
fear
he
was
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
the
dreaded
red
men
.
<EOS>
The
young
hunter
was
brave
,
but
he
was
not
reckless
.
<EOS>
He
had
refused
to
turn
aside
to
avoid
a
collision
with
the
cougar
,
but
he
did
not
hesitate
to
leave
the
trail
,
in
the
hope
of
escaping
the
savages
who
were
likely
to
be
attracted
by
the
report
of
the
gun
.
<EOS>
From
the
beginning
the
lad
had
stepped
as
lightly
as
possible
,
bringing
his
feet
softly
but
squarely
down
on
the
ground
,
after
the
fashion
of
the
American
Indian
,
when
threading
his
way
through
the
trackless
forest
.
<EOS>
He
now
used
the
utmost
care
in
leaving
the
trail
,
for
none
knew
better
than
he
the
amazing
keenness
of
the
dark
eyes
that
were
liable
to
scan
the
ground
over
which
he
had
passed
.
<EOS>
Not
until
he
was
several
rods
from
the
footprints
of
the
flying
horse
did
he
advance
with
anything
like
assurance
.
<EOS>
He
then
moved
with
more
certainty
until
he
reached
a
chestnut
,
whose
trunk
was
broad
enough
to
afford
all
the
concealment
he
could
desire
.
<EOS>
Stepping
behind
this
,
Jack
assumed
a
position
which
gave
him
a
view
of
the
trail
,
with
no
likelihood
of
being
seen
,
unless
the
suspicion
of
the
Indians
should
be
directed
to
the
spot
.
<EOS>
“If
<EOS>
they
are
coming
,
it
is
time
they
showed
themselves
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
words
were
yet
in
the
mouth
of
the
youth
,
when
something
seemed
to
twinkle
and
flicker
among
the
trees
,
in
advance
of
the
point
where
he
had
turned
aside
from
the
path
.
<EOS>
A
second
look
allowed
that
two
Indian
warriors
were
returning
along
the
trail
.
<EOS>
He
recognized
them
as
Shawanoes
—
one
of
the
fiercest
tribes
that
resisted
the
march
of
civilization
a
century
ago
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
said
that
they
corresponded
to
the
Apaches
of
the
present
day
.
<EOS>
The
couple
were
scrutinizing
the
ground
,
as
they
advanced
with
heads
thrown
forward
and
their
serpent
-
like
eyes
flitting
from
side
to
side
.
<EOS>
Manifestly
they
were
expecting
to
discover
certain
parties
along
the
trail
itself
.
<EOS>
There
may
have
been
something
in
the
peculiar
sound
of
the
rifle
,
which
raised
their
suspicions
,
though
it
is
hard
to
understand
wherein
the
report
of
two
similarly
made
weapons
can
possess
any
perceptible
difference
.
<EOS>
Be
that
as
it
may
,
that
which
Jack
Carleton
feared
had
taken
place
—
the
shot
which
killed
the
cougar
brought
far
more
dangerous
enemies
to
the
spot
.
<EOS>
The
lad
would
have
had
no
difficulty
in
picking
off
one
of
the
warriors
,
but
he
had
not
the
remotest
intention
of
doing
so
.
<EOS>
There
could
be
no
justification
for
such
a
wanton
act
,
and
the
consequences
could
not
fail
to
be
disastrous
to
himself
.
<EOS>
He
was
never
better
prepared
to
support
the
creed
of
the
frontiersmen
who
would
willingly
leave
the
red
men
unmolested
if
they
in
turn
sought
to
do
them
no
harm
.
<EOS>
The
Shawanoes
soon
passed
by
,
making
no
pause
until
they
reached
the
carcass
of
the
panther
.
<EOS>
They
quickly
saw
the
bullet
-
wound
,
between
his
fore
legs
,
and
understood
that
his
heart
had
been
pierced
while
in
the
act
of
leaping
from
his
perch
upon
the
hunter
beneath
.
<EOS>
A
brief
scrutiny
of
the
ground
brought
to
light
the
impressions
of
the
calf
-
skin
shoes
of
him
who
had
fired
the
fatal
shot
.
<EOS>
They
understood
at
once
that
the
party
was
a
white
person
,
and
,
judging
from
the
size
of
the
footprints
,
he
clearly
was
an
adult
-
one
who
,
it
was
safe
to
conclude
,
was
able
to
taking
good
care
of
himself
;
but
it
must
have
been
a
relief
to
the
warriors
when
their
examination
of
the
earth
showed
that
only
a
single
member
of
the
detested
race
had
been
concerned
in
the
death
of
the
cougar
.
<EOS>
That
which
followed
was
precisely
what
the
watcher
expected
.
<EOS>
The
moment
the
red
men
were
certain
of
the
direction
taken
by
the
hunter
they
started
along
the
same
line
.
<EOS>
The
foremost
looked
down
for
an
instant
at
the
ground
,
and
then
seemed
to
dart
a
glance
at
every
visible
point
around
him
.
<EOS>
The
other
warrior
did
not
once
look
down
,
but
guarded
against
running
into
any
ambush
for
it
<EOS>
need
not
be
said
that
the
task
on
which
they
were
engaged
was
most
delicate
and
dangerous
.
<EOS>
The
American
Indian
can
not
excel
the
white
man
in
woodcraft
and
subtlety
,
and
no
Kentucky
pioneer
ever
stood
still
and
allowed
a
dusky
foe
to
creep
upon
him
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
conceded
that
a
point
had
been
reached
where
Jack
Carleton
had
good
cause
for
alarm
.
<EOS>
Those
Shawanoe
were
following
his
trail
,
and
they
had
but
to
keep
it
up
for
a
short
distance
when
he
was
certain
to
be
“
uncovered
.
<EOS>
”“I
wish
there
was
only
one
of
them
,
”
muttered
the
youth
,
stealthily
peering
from
behind
the
tree
;
“
it
will
be
hard
to
manage
two
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
coolness
of
Jack
was
extraordinary
.
<EOS>
Though
he
felt
the
situation
was
critical
in
the
highest
degree
,
yet
there
was
not
a
tremor
of
the
muscles
,
nor
blanching
of
the
countenance
,
as
it
would
seem
was
inevitable
when
such
a
desperate
encounter
impended
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
single
,
shadowy
hope
;
it
was
fast
growing
dark
in
the
woods
,
and
the
eyes
of
the
Shawanoes
,
keen
as
they
were
,
must
soon
fail
them
.
<EOS>
The
sun
had
set
and
twilight
already
filled
the
forest
arches
with
gloom
.
<EOS>
Peering
around
the
bark
,
Jack
saw
the
leading
Indian
bend
lower
,
leaving
to
the
other
the
task
of
guarding
against
mishap
.
<EOS>
He
walked
more
slowly
;
it
was
plain
his
task
was
not
only
difficult
,
but
was
becoming
more
so
every
moment
.
<EOS>
Jack
followed
the
movements
with
rapt
attention
.
<EOS>
Knowing
the
precise
point
where
he
had
left
the
path
,
his
heart
throbbed
faster
than
was
its
wo
nt
,
when
he
saw
his
enemies
close
to
the
tingle
in
his
course
.
<EOS>
A
half
minute
later
they
were
beyond
—
they
had
overrun
his
trail
.
<EOS>
A
short
distance
only
was
passed
,
when
the
warriors
seemed
to
suspect
the
truth
.
<EOS>
They
came
to
a
halt
,
and
the
trail
-
hunter
sank
upon
his
knees
.
<EOS>
His
head
was
so
close
to
the
ground
that
it
looked
as
if
he
were
drawing
lines
and
figures
with
his
curving
nose
,
which
slowly
circled
around
and
back
and
forth
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
the
palm
of
his
right
hand
gently
moved
over
the
leaves
,
touching
them
as
lightly
as
the
falling
snowflakes
,
and
with
as
wonderful
delicacy
as
that
of
the
blind
reader
,
when
his
fingers
are
groping
over
the
raised
letters
of
the
Book
of
Life
.
<EOS>
The
young
Kentuckian
from
his
place
of
concealment
smiled
to
himself
.
<EOS>
“There
are
some
things
which
even
a
Shawanoe
,
can
not
do
,
and
that
's
one
of
them
.
<EOS>
”Such
was
the
fact
;
for
,
with
that
care
which
the
trained
pioneer
never
permits
himself
to
forget
or
disregard
,
the
lad
had
adopted
every
artifice
at
his
command
to
add
to
the
difficulty
of
identifying
his
footsteps
.
<EOS>
The
warrior
straightened
up
with
an
impatient
“
Ugh
!
”
<EOS>
which
brought
another
smile
to
the
face
of
the
watcher
,
for
it
proved
beyond
question
the
failure
of
his
foes
.
<EOS>
The
Shawanoe
,
however
,
had
established
one
fact
—
the
overrunning
of
the
trail
.
<EOS>
The
one
for
whom
they
were
searching
had
left
the
path
at
some
point
behind
them
.
<EOS>
Scant
chance
was
there
of
learning
the
precise
spot
.
<EOS>
“Follow
me
<EOS>
if
you
can
,
”
was
the
exultant
thought
of
Jack
,
who
carefully
lowered
the
hammer
of
his
rifle
.
<EOS>
“
I
'm
glad
that
as
the
painter
was
determined
on
picking
a
quarrel
with
me
he
did
not
do
it
earlier
in
the
day
—
helloa!”While
speaking
to
himself
,
he
became
aware
that
the
warriors
were
invisible
.
<EOS>
They
may
have
believed
they
were
acting
as
oscillating
targets
for
some
hidden
enemy
,
who
was
likely
to
press
the
trigger
at
any
moment
;
and
,
unable
even
to
approximate
as
they
were
his
biding
-
place
,
they
withdrew
in
their
characteristic
fashion
.
<EOS>
Jack
thrust
his
head
still
further
from
behind
the
tree
,
and
finally
stepped
forth
that
he
might
obtain
the
best
view
he
could
.
<EOS>
But
the
red
men
had
vanished
like
the
shadows
of
swiftly
-
moving
clouds
.
<EOS>
Nothing
more
was
to
be
feared
from
that
source
.
<EOS>
But
with
the
lifting
of
the
peril
from
his
own
shoulders
,
there
returned
his
distressing
anxiety
for
his
absent
companion
.
<EOS>
No
doubt
could
exist
that
when
he
put
his
horse
to
his
hurried
flight
,
he
had
done
so
to
escape
the
Indians
.
<EOS>
Whether
he
had
succeeded
remained
to
be
learned
,
but
Jack
felt
that
every
probability
was
against
it
.
<EOS>
He
might
well
debate
as
to
his
own
duty
in
the
premises
.
<EOS>
His
one
desire
was
to
learn
what
had
become
of
Otto
,
the
German
lad
,
with
whom
he
left
the
Settlements
a
couple
of
days
before
.
<EOS>
Neither
had
ever
visited
this
section
,
but
they
were
following
the
instructions
of
those
who
had
,
and
the
young
Kentuckian
knew
the
precise
point
in
their
journey
that
had
been
reached
.
<EOS>
Standing
as
motionless
as
the
trees
beside
him
and
amid
the
darkening
shadows
,
Jack
Carleton
listened
with
the
intentness
of
an
Indian
scout
stealing
into
a
hostile
camp
.
<EOS>
The
soft
murmur
which
seems
to
reach
us
when
a
sea
-
shell
is
held
to
the
ear
filled
the
air
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
voice
of
the
night
—
the
sighing
of
the
scarcely
moving
wind
among
the
multitudinous
branches
,
the
restless
movements
of
myriads
of
trees
—
the
soft
embrace
of
millions
of
leaves
,
which
,
like
the
great
ocean
itself
,
even
when
the
air
is
pulseless
,
is
never
at
rest
.
<EOS>
Jack
Carleton
had
spent
too
many
days
and
nights
in
the
woods
to
be
greatly
impressed
with
the
solemnity
and
grandeur
of
his
surroundings
.
<EOS>
That
which
would
have
awed
his
soul
,
if
noted
for
the
first
time
,
had
lost
the
power
to
do
so
from
its
familiarity
;
but
while
in
the
attitude
of
listening
,
he
became
conscious
of
another
sound
which
did
not
belong
to
the
vast
forest
,
the
throbbing
air
,
nor
the
gathering
darkness
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
III
.
<EOS>
ON
THE
BANK
OF
THE
MISSISSIPPIThat
which
reached
the
ears
of
Jack
Carleton
,
while
he
stood
in
the
woods
,
silent
and
listening
,
was
a
peculiar
swashing
noise
,
which
continued
a
few
seconds
,
followed
by
the
same
space
of
silence
—
the
intervals
being
as
regular
as
the
ticking
of
a
huge
pendulum
.
<EOS>
Accompanying
the
sound
was
another
,
a
soft
,
almost
inaudible
flow
,
such
as
one
hears
when
standing
on
the
bank
of
a
vast
stream
of
water
.
<EOS>
He
knew
that
both
were
caused
by
the
sweep
of
the
mighty
Mississippi
which
was
near
at
hand
.
<EOS>
The
reason
for
the
first
he
could
not
understand
,
but
that
of
the
latter
was
apparent
.
<EOS>
He
had
never
looked
upon
the
Father
of
Waters
,
but
many
a
time
he
had
rested
along
the
Ohio
and
been
lulled
to
sleep
by
its
musical
flow
,
even
while
the
camp
-
fires
of
the
hostile
red
men
twinkled
on
the
other
shore
.
<EOS>
Manifestly
nothing
could
be
done
by
remaining
where
he
was
,
and
,
in
the
same
guarded
manner
in
which
he
left
the
trail
a
half
hour
before
,
he
began
picking
his
way
back
.
<EOS>
Probably
he
ran
greater
personal
risk
in
following
the
beaten
path
,
yet
he
was
controlled
by
a
true
hunter
's
instinct
in
every
movement
made
.
<EOS>
When
he
reached
the
trail
,
he
observed
that
not
only
had
the
night
descended
,
but
the
full
moon
was
shining
from
an
almost
unclouded
sky
.
<EOS>
The
trees
,
crowned
with
exuberant
vegetation
,
cast
deep
shadows
,
like
those
of
the
electric
light
,
and
only
here
<EOS>
and
there
did
the
arrowy
moonbeams
strike
the
ground
,
redolent
with
the
odors
of
fresh
earth
and
moldering
leaves
.
<EOS>
“Some
of
the
warriors
may
be
returning
or
groping
along
the
trail
,
”
was
the
thought
of
the
youth
,
who
glided
silently
forward
,
his
senses
on
the
alert
.
<EOS>
His
misgivings
,
however
,
were
much
less
than
when
watching
the
two
Shawanoes
,
for
with
the
dense
gloom
of
the
forest
inclosing
him
on
every
hand
<EOS>
,
he
felt
that
the
shelter
was
not
only
secure
but
was
of
instant
avail
.
<EOS>
Less
than
a
furlong
was
passed
,
when
he
caught
the
shimmering
of
water
.
<EOS>
A
few
steps
further
<EOS>
and
he
stood
for
the
first
time
on
the
bank
of
the
Mississippi
.
<EOS>
The
youth
felt
those
emotions
which
must
come
to
every
one
when
he
emerges
from
a
vast
forest
at
night
and
pauses
beside
one
of
the
grandest
streams
of
the
globe
.
<EOS>
At
that
day
its
real
source
was
unknown
,
but
Jack
,
who
was
unusually
well
informed
for
one
of
his
years
,
was
aware
that
it
rose
somewhere
among
the
snowy
mountains
and
unexplored
regions
far
to
the
northward
,
and
that
,
after
its
winding
course
of
hundreds
of
leagues
,
during
which
it
received
the
volume
of
many
rivers
,
enormous
in
themselves
,
it
debouched
into
the
tropical
waters
of
the
Gulf
of
Mexico
.
<EOS>
The
reflection
of
the
turbid
current
showed
that
it
was
flowing
swiftly
.
<EOS>
The
dark
line
of
the
forest
on
the
other
shore
appeared
like
a
solid
wall
of
blackness
,
while
to
the
north
and
south
the
view
ended
in
the
same
impenetrable
gloom
.
<EOS>
Impressed
and
awed
by
the
scene
,
the
lad
saw
something
which
at
first
startled
him
by
its
resemblance
to
a
man
,
standing
in
the
river
,
with
his
feet
braced
against
the
bottom
and
his
head
and
shoulders
above
the
surface
.
<EOS>
The
current
seemed
to
rush
against
his
bared
breast
,
from
which
it
was
cast
back
and
aside
,
as
though
flung
off
by
a
granite
rock
.
<EOS>
Then
the
head
bowed
forward
,
as
if
the
strong
man
sought
to
bathe
his
brain
in
the
cooling
waters
,
that
he
might
be
refreshed
against
the
next
shock
.
<EOS>
A
minute
's
scrutiny
was
enough
to
show
Jack
that
the
object
was
a
tree
,
which
,
rolling
into
the
river
at
some
point
,
perhaps
hundreds
of
miles
above
,
had
grown
weary
of
its
journey
,
and
,
plunging
its
feet
into
the
muddy
bed
of
the
stream
,
had
,
refused
to
go
further
.
<EOS>
The
fierce
current
would
lift
the
head
several
feet
with
a
splash
,
but
could
hold
it
thus
only
a
part
of
a
minute
,
when
it
would
dip
for
a
brief
while
,
to
rise
again
and
repeat
the
action
.
<EOS>
The
tree
was
what
is
known
to
-
day
on
the
Mississippi
as
a
“
sawyer
,
”
and
which
is
so
dreaded
by
the
steamers
and
other
craft
navigating
the
river
.
<EOS>
Many
a
boat
striking
at
full
speed
against
them
,
have
had
their
hulls
pierced
as
if
by
a
hundred
-
pound
shell
,
and
have
gone
to
the
bottom
like
stone
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
sound
made
by
the
“
sawyer
”
which
had
puzzled
Jack
Carleton
before
he
caught
sight
of
the
great
river
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
wonder
that
he
had
failed
to
guess
the
cause
of
the
intermittent
swash
which
reached
him
through
the
woods
.
<EOS>
“And
we
must
cross
that
stream
,
”
murmured
Jack
,
with
half
a
shudder
,
as
he
looked
out
upon
the
prodigious
volume
rushing
southward
like
myriads
of
wild
horses
;
“
it
seems
to
me
no
one
can
swim
to
the
other
shore
,
nor
can
a
raft
or
boat
be
pushed
thither
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
plucky
boy
would
not
have
felt
so
distrustful
and
timid
<EOS>
had
the
sun
been
shining
overhead
.
<EOS>
“Ish
<EOS>
dot
you
,
Jack?”Young
Carleton
turned
his
head
as
if
a
war
hoop
had
sounded
in
his
ear
.
<EOS>
He
fairly
bounded
feet
when
he
recognized
his
old
friend
at
his
elbow
.
<EOS>
The
good
-
natured
German
lad
was
grinning
with
delight
,
as
he
extended
his
chubby
hand
and
<EOS>
asked:“How
you
vos?”“Why
,
Otto
!
”
<EOS>
gasped
Jack
,
slapping
his
palm
against
that
of
his
friend
and
crushing
it
as
if
in
a
vise
.
<EOS>
“
I
am
so
glad
to
see
you
.
<EOS>
”“So
<EOS>
I
vos
,
”
was
the
grinning
response
;
“
I
'm
always
glad
to
shake
hands
mit
myself”“But
,
”
said
the
other
,
looking
furtively
over
each
shoulder
in
turn
,
“
let
's
move
away
the
trail
,
where
we
can
not
be
seen
or
heard
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
suggestion
was
a
wise
one
,
and
acted
upon
without
delay
.
<EOS>
The
friends
entered
the
wood
,
which
continued
quite
open
,
and
tramped
steadily
forward
with
the
intention
of
finding
place
where
they
could
start
a
fire
and
converse
without
danger
of
discovery
by
enemies
.
<EOS>
The
hearts
of
both
were
too
full
for
hold
their
peace
while
stealing
forward
among
the
trees
.
<EOS>
“Otto
,
”
said
Jack
,
“
where
is
the
colt?”“I
dinks
<EOS>
he
's
purty
near
New
Orleans
as
soon
as
dis
time
.
<EOS>
”Young
<EOS>
Carleton
looked
wonderingly
toward
friend
and
asked
,
“
What
do
you
mean?”“I
<EOS>
do
n't
mean
vot
<EOS>
I
do
n't
say
and
derefore
dinks
<EOS>
I
mean
vot
I
vos
.
<EOS>
”“So
<EOS>
the
colt
went
into
the
river
?
<EOS>
Where
were
you?”“Mit
de
colt
<EOS>
and
he
vos
<EOS>
mit
me
<EOS>
,
so
we
bot
vos
mit
each
other
.
<EOS>
Just
feels
of
me
.
<EOS>
”Jack
reached
out
his
hand
and
pinched
the
clothing
of
his
friend
in
several
places
.
<EOS>
It
was
saturated
.
<EOS>
“Ven
<EOS>
I
valks
,
de
vater
in
my
shoes
squishes
up
to
mine
ears
—
<EOS>
don't
<EOS>
you
hear
'
em?”“Why
do
n't
you
pour
it
out?”“I
<EOS>
hef
done
so
<EOS>
,
tree
time
already
—
I
done
so
again
once
more
.
<EOS>
”And
,
without
ado
,
the
young
German
threw
himself
forward
on
his
hands
and
head
and
kicked
his
feet
with
a
vigor
that
sent
the
moisture
in
every
direction
.
<EOS>
Indeed
the
performance
was
conducted
with
so
much
ardor
that
one
of
the
shoes
flow
off
with
considerable
violence
.
<EOS>
Otto
then
reversed
himself
and
assumed
the
upright
posture
.
<EOS>
“Mine
gracious
,
”
he
exclaimed
,
“
where
did
n't
dot
shoe
of
mine
went?”“It
<EOS>
just
missed
my
face
,
”
replied
Jack
,
with
a
laugh
.
<EOS>
“Dot
<EOS>
vos
lucky
,
”
said
Otto
,
beginning
to
search
for
his
property
.
<EOS>
“Yes
;
it
might
have
hurt
me
pretty
bad
.
<EOS>
”“I
means
it
vos
lucky
for
de
shoe
,
”
added
Otto
,
who
,
in
groping
about
,
stumbled
at
that
moment
upon
the
missing
article
.
<EOS>
“
Bime
by
de
vater
soaks
down
mine
shoes
agin
and
I
stands
on
head
and
kicks
it
out
.
<EOS>
”But
<EOS>
Jack
Carleton
was
anxious
to
learn
what
had
befallen
his
friend
since
their
voluntary
separation
some
hours
before
,
and
so
,
while
they
were
advancing
along
the
shore
,
the
story
was
told
.
<EOS>
Otto
,
as
he
had
agreed
to
do
,
was
riding
at
a
leisurely
pace
,
when
,
without
the
least
warning
,
the
sharp
crack
of
a
rifle
broke
the
stillness
of
,
the
woods
on
his
right
,
and
the
bullet
zipped
so
close
to
his
forehead
that
it
literally
grazed
the
skin
,
leaving
a
faint
mark
,
which
was
visible
several
days
afterward
.
<EOS>
The
lad
was
never
so
frightened
in
all
his
life
.
<EOS>
For
a
minute
or
so
he
was
absolutely
speechless
,
during
which
the
horse
,
alarmed
in
a
less
degree
than
he
,
broke
into
a
trot
.
<EOS>
Otto
,
however
,
quickly
regained
his
self
-
control
,
and
fully
realized
his
danger
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
glance
behind
him
nor
to
the
right
or
left
.
<EOS>
No
investigation
was
needed
convince
him
of
his
peril
.
<EOS>
He
put
the
horse
to
a
dead
run
,
first
throwing
himself
forward
on
his
neck
so
as
to
offer
the
least
possible
target
to
his
enemies
.
<EOS>
Only
the
single
shot
was
fired
,
and
Jack
counted
it
strange
that
the
report
failed
to
reach
his
ears
.
<EOS>
When
the
fugitive
had
gone
a
considerable
distance
,
he
ventured
to
look
back
.
<EOS>
He
thought
he
saw
several
Indians
,
but
it
was
probably
fancy
,
for
had
they
observed
he
was
leaving
them
behind
<EOS>
(
as
would
have
been
the
case
)
,
they
surely
would
have
appealed
to
their
rifles
again
.
<EOS>
Otto
was
in
such
danger
from
the
overhanging
limbs
,
and
was
so
fearful
that
he
was
running
a
gauntlet
of
Indians
,
that
he
kept
his
head
close
to
the
mane
of
his
steed
and
scarcely
looked
to
see
where
they
were
going
.
<EOS>
The
awakening
came
like
an
electric
shock
,
when
the
terrified
horse
made
a
tremendous
plunge
straight
out
into
the
river
.
<EOS>
The
first
notice
Otto
received
was
the
chilling
embrace
of
the
waters
which
enveloped
him
to
the
ears
.
<EOS>
He
held
his
rifle
in
his
right
hand
,
and
,
in
his
desperate
efforts
to
save
that
,
was
swept
from
the
back
of
the
animal
,
which
began
swimming
composedly
down
stream
,
carrying
saddle
,
blankets
and
other
valuable
articles
that
were
strapped
to
him
back
.
<EOS>
Encumbered
with
his
heavy
clothing
and
his
gun
,
young
Otto
Relstaub
had
all
he
could
do
to
fight
his
way
back
to
land
.
<EOS>
He
escaped
shipwreck
as
by
a
hair's
-
breadth
,
from
the
sawyer
which
had
attracted
the
notice
of
Jack
.
<EOS>
“I
<EOS>
vos
swimming
as
hard
as
nefer
vos
<EOS>
,
”
he
explained
,
“
and
had
just
got
in
front
of
the
tree
,
ven
as
true
as
I
do
n't
live
,
it
banged
right
down
on
top
mit
me
and
nearly
knocked
out
my
brains
out
.
<EOS>
I
grabbed
hold
of
it
,
when
it
raised
up
and
frowed
me
over
its
head
.
<EOS>
Den
I
gots
mad
and
swims
ashore
.
<EOS>
”Jack
<EOS>
laughed
,
for
,
<EOS>
though
he
knew
his
friend
was
prone
to
exaggeration
,
he
could
understand
that
his
experience
was
similar
,
in
many
respects
,
to
what
he
had
stated
.
<EOS>
“After
<EOS>
the
shore
reaches
me
,
”
continued
Otto
,
“
<EOS>
I
turns
around
free
,
four
times
to
find
where
I
ai
n't
.
<EOS>
I
see
de
colt
going
down
stream
as
fast
as
if
two
Indians
was
on
his
back
sitting
and
paddling
him
mit
paddles
.
<EOS>
I
called
to
him
to
come
back
and
explained
dot
he
would
cotch
him
cold
if
he
did
n't
stay
too
long
in
de
vater
,
but
he
makes
belief
<EOS>
he
do
n't
hears
me
,
and
I
bothers
him
no
more
.
”“There
<EOS>
will
be
trouble
at
home
when
your
father
finds
out
the
colt
is
lost
,
”
said
Jack
Carleton
,
who
knew
how
harsh
the
parent
of
Otto
was
;
“
it
must
be
he
returned
to
land
further
down
.
<EOS>
”“Yes
<EOS>
;
bimeby
he
comes
ashore
.
<EOS>
”“Why
did
n't
you
recover
him?”“'Cause
he
swims
out
on
de
oder
side
and
he
would
not
wait
till
I
could
go
back
mit
de

and
got
mine
frens
to
come
and
build
one

Indian
or
maybe
some
other
loafer
.
<EOS>
”Jack
<EOS>
Carleton
was
about
to
reply
to
this
remark
when
both
he
and
his
friend
caught
sight
the
same
moment
of
the
star
-
like
twinkle
of
a
point
of
light
.
<EOS>
While
there
was
nothing
specially
noteworthy
in
this
,
yet
both
were
impressed
by
the
fact
that
the
light
was
not
only
on
the
river
,
but
was
serving
as
a
signal
to
some
one
standing
on
the
same
shore
with
them
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
IV
.
<EOS>
THE
VISITOR
FROM
THE
OTHER
SHOREJack
Carleton
and
Otto
Relstaub
saw
the
twinkling
point
of
light
,
glowing
like
a
star
from
the
bank
of
darkness
on
the
other
side
the
Mississippi
.
<EOS>
It
shone
for
a
minute
with
an
intense
brightness
,
and
then
,
to
their
amazement
,
began
revolving
in
a
circle
of
a
foot
or
more
in
diameter
.
<EOS>
It
sped
round
and
round
with
such
swiftness
that
it
resembled
a
wheel
of
fire
without
the
slightest
break
in
the
flaming
periphery
.
<EOS>
“What
<EOS>
can
it
mean
?
”
<EOS>
asked
the
mystified
Jack
.
<EOS>
“I
vos
told
something
apout
afire
dot
vos
to
jump
apout
in
one
circle
,
”
was
the
remarkable
statement
of
Otto
.
<EOS>
“What
was
it?”“I
do
n't
forgot
him
now
,
”
replied
the
German
with
the
hesitating
speech
of
one
in
doubt
.
<EOS>
“Well
,
you
're
the
prize
blockhead
of
the
West
,
”
was
the
impatient
comment
of
the
young
Kentuckian
.
<EOS>
“
How
you
could
have
heard
anything
of
that
signal
—
as
it
must
be
—
and
forget
it
is
beyond
my
understanding
.
<EOS>
”“Dot
's
what
I
dinks
.
<EOS>
I
'll
remember
sometime
after
a
few
days
—
<EOS>
helloa!”His
exclamation
was
caused
by
the
blotting
out
of
the
circular
fire
which
had
caused
so
much
speculation
.
<EOS>
Looking
toward
the
western
bank
of
the
Mississippi
all
was
darkness
again
,
the
light
having
vanished
.
<EOS>
Jack
stooped
so
as
to
bring
his
head
on
a
level
with
the
surface
of
the
river
,
and
peered
intently
out
over
the
moonlit
surface
.
<EOS>
“That
torch
was
waved
by
an
Indian
in
a
canoe
,
”
said
he
,
in
a
low
voice
,
“
and
he
is
paddling
this
way
.
<EOS>
”Otto
imitated
the
action
of
his
friend
,
and
saw
that
he
had
spoken
the
truth
.
<EOS>
The
outlines
of
a
boat
,
dimly
distinguishable
,
were
assuming
definite
shape
with
such
rapidity
that
there
could
be
no
doubt
the
craft
was
approaching
them
.
<EOS>
As
there
was
no
question
that
the
fiery
ring
was
meant
for
a
signal
,
Jack
Carleton
concluded
that
a
party
of
red
men
were
communicating
with
those
from
whom
the
boys
had
effected
so
narrow
an
escape
.
<EOS>
Such
a
supposition
showed
the
necessity
of
great
care
,
and
the
friends
,
without
speaking
,
stepped
further
from
the
edge
of
the
stream
,
where
they
were
in
no
danger
of
being
seen
.
<EOS>
As
the
boat
came
nearer
,
and
its
shape
was
more
clearly
marked
,
the
boys
discovered
that
only
a
single
warrior
sat
within
.
<EOS>
He
was
in
the
stern
,
manipulating
his
long
,
ashen
paddle
with
such
rare
skill
that
he
seemed
to
pay
no
heed
to
the
current
at
all
.
<EOS>
“There
's
only
one
of
them
,
”
whispered
the
astonished
Jack
.
<EOS>
“
How
easily
we
can
pick
him
off!”Otto
brought
his
gun
to
his
shoulder
.
<EOS>
“What
<EOS>
do
you
mean
?
”
demanded
the
angry
Jack
.
<EOS>
“Pick
him
off!”“No
,
you
do
n't
.
<EOS>
He
may
be
a
friend
.
<EOS>
”“We'll
found
dot
out
,
after
we
do
n't
shoot
him
.
<EOS>
Let
's
shoot
him
first
,
”
was
the
suggestion
of
Otto
,
“
and
then
ax
him
the
question
.
<EOS>
”“Even
<EOS>
if
an
enemy
—
as
he
undoubtedly
is
—
it
would
be
cowardly
to
slay
him
in
that
fashion
.
<EOS>
As
there
is
only
one—!”“Dere
!
”
exclaimed
the
young
Teuton
,
hardly
to
suppress
his
excitement
over
the
recollection
;
“
I
knowed
dat
<EOS>
I
had
recumlected
some
dings
.
<EOS>
”“What
is
it?”“Dot
young
gentleman
in
dot
boat
is
a
great
friend
of
mine
.
<EOS>
He

<EOS>
”“Who
is
he
?
”
<EOS>
asked
the
astonished
Jack
.
<EOS>
“Deerfoot
,
the
Shawanoe
,
”
was
the
reply
of
Otto
,
who
,
with
a
light
heart
,
stepped
closer
to
the
edge
of
the
swiftly
flowing
river
and
called
out:“Holloa
,
Deerfoot
!
<EOS>
How
you
vos?”The
mention
of
the
name
called
up
strange
emotions
in
the
breast
of
Jack
Carleton
.
<EOS>
For
a
year
previous
,
stories
had
reached
the
settlement
where
he
had
made
his
home
,
of
the
wonderful
Shawanoe
youth
,
who
was
captured
when
a
child
,
and
while
he
was
as
untameable
in
his
hatred
of
the
whites
as
a
spitting
wildcat
,
but
who
was
transformed
by
kindness
into
the
most
devoted
friend
of
the
pioneers
.
<EOS>
Ned
Preston
,
who
lived
at
Wild
Oaks
,
nearly
a
hundred
miles
distant
from
Jack
's
home
,
visited
the
latter
a
few
months
before
,
while
on
a
hunting
excursion
,
with
his
colored
friend
Wild
-
blossom
Brown
,
and
it
was
from
him
that
Jack
had
gained
many
particulars
of
the
remarkable
history
of
the
young
Shawanoe
.
<EOS>
Jack
credited
the
statements
of
Deerfoot
's
amazing
skill
in
the
use
of
his
bow
and
arrow
,
his
wonderful
fleetness
of
foot
,
and
his
chivalrous
devotion
to
his
friends
;
but
when
told
that
the
youth
could
not
only
read
,
but
could
write
an
excellent
hand
,
and
that
he
was
a
true
Christian
,
Jack
felt
many
misgivings
of
the
truth
of
the
whole
story
.
<EOS>
Jack
recalled
further
the
statement
that
Deerfoot
was
held
in
such
detestation
by
his
own
race
that
he
became
convinced
his
presence
was
an
element
of
weakness
rather
than
strength
to
his
friends
,
and
it
was
for
that
reason
he
had
migrated
west
of
the
Mississippi
.
<EOS>
The
youthful
warrior
,
seated
in
the
stem
of
the
canoe
,
gave
no
evidence
that
he
saw
the
stubby
figure
of
the
German
lad
who
stepped
close
to
the
water
and
hailed
him
by
name
.
<EOS>
One
powerful
impulse
of
the
paddle
sent
the
bark
structure
far
up
the
bank
,
like
the
snout
of
some
aquatic
monster
plunging
after
the
lad
awaiting
it
.
<EOS>
Before
it
came
to
rest
,
Deerfoot
sprang
lightly
ashore
,
and
,
grasping
the
front
of
the
boat
,
drew
it
still
further
from
the
river
,
where
it
was
not
only
safe
against
being
swept
away
,
but
could
not
be
seen
by
any
one
passing
in
the
neighborhood
.
<EOS>
His
next
proceeding
was
to
pick
up
his
bow
from
the
bottom
of
the
canoe
,
after
which
he
was
prepared
to
see
that
others
were
near
him
.
<EOS>
Turning
about
,
he
extended
his
hand
to
Otto
with
the
smiling
greeting
:
“
How
do
you
do
,
my
brother?”The
words
were
spoken
with
as
perfect
accentuation
as
Jack
Carleton
could
have
used
.
<EOS>
Had
the
speaker
been
invisible
,
no
one
would
have
believed
him
to
be
an
Indian
.
<EOS>
“I
does
vell
,
”
replied
Otto
,
shaking
his
hand
firmly
.
<EOS>
“
Dis
ish
my
friend
,
Jack
Carleton
,
dot
I
dinks
a
good
deal
of
.
<EOS>
”Dropping
<EOS>
the
hand
of
the
German
,
Deerfoot
took
one
step
forward
and
saluted
the
young
Kentuckian
in
the
same
manner
.
<EOS>
He
pressed
his
hand
warmly
,
and
,
with
the
same
smile
as
before
,
said:“Deerfoot
is
glad
to
meet
his
brother
.
<EOS>
”As
<EOS>
he
uttered
these
words
the
moonlight
fell
on
his
face
and
the
front
part
of
his
body
,
so
that
a
better
view
of
countenance
and
features
could
not
have
been
obtained
.
<EOS>
Nearly
a
year
had
passed
since
we
last
saw
Deerfoot
(
see
“
Ned
on
the
River
"
)
.
<EOS>
During
that
period
,
he
had
almost
attained
the
full
stature
of
a
warrior
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
said
that
there
was
no
single
person
,
whether
of
his
own
or
the
Caucasian
race
,
whom
Deerfoot
held
in
personal
fear
.
<EOS>
Those
who
have
done
me
the
honor
of
reading
the
“
Young
Pioneer
Series
,
”
will
recall
the
marked
attractiveness
of
Deerfoot
's
countenance
.
<EOS>
The
classical
regularity
of
his
features
was
relieved
from
effeminacy
by
the
slightly
Roman
nose
,
which
,
with
the
thin
lips
,
gave
him
an
expression
of
firmness
and
nerve
that
was
true
to
his
character
.
<EOS>
When
he
stepped
in
front
of
the
great
Tecumseh
,
with
his
knife
clenched
in
his
band
,
and
dared
the
chieftain
to
mortal
combat
,
the
luminous
black
eyes
flashed
lightning
,
and
the
muscles
on
the
graceful
limbs
were
knotted
like
iron
.
<EOS>
They
were
now
in
repose
and
the
eyes
were
as
soft
as
those
of
a
maiden
.
<EOS>
When
Deerfoot
smiled
it
was
rarely
more
than
it
faint
,
shadowy
expression
,
just
sufficient
to
reveal
the
small
,
even
,
white
teeth
and
to
add
to
the
winsomeness
of
his
expression
.
<EOS>
The
love
of
finery
and
display
seems
natural
to
every
human
being
,
and
it
manifested
itself
in
the
dress
of
the
young
Shawanoe
.
<EOS>
The
long
black
hair
,
which
streamed
down
his
shoulders
,
was
ornamented
at
the
crown
by
several
eagle
feathers
,
brilliantly
stained
and
thrust
in
place
.
<EOS>
The
fringes
of
the
neatly
fitting
leggings
were
also
colored
,
and
the
moccasins
which
incased
the
small
shapely
feet
,
were
interwoven
with
beads
of
every
line
of
the
rainbow
.
<EOS>
The
body
of
the
hunting
shirt
as
well
as
the
skirt
,
which
descended
almost
to
his
knees
,
showed
what
may
be
called
a
certain
subdued
gaudiness
which
was
not
without
its
attractiveness
.
<EOS>
The
waist
of
the
Shawanoe
was
clasped
by
a
girdle
into
which
were
thrust
a
knife
and
tomahawk
.
<EOS>
Relying
upon
the
bow
,
instead
of
the
rifle
,
he
carried
a
quiver
full
of
arrows
,
just
showing
over
the
right
shoulder
,
where
they
could
be
readily
plucked
with
his
deft
left
hand
,
whenever
required
.
<EOS>
Deerfoot
had
tested
both
the
rifle
and
the
bowl
and
as
has
been
shown
gave
his
adherence
to
the
latter
.
<EOS>
Jack
Carleton
said
to
himself
,
“
He
is
the
handsomest
being
I
ever
looked
upon
.
<EOS>
”He
was
perfect
in
build
,
graceful
in
every
movement
,
with
an
activity
and
power
almost
incredible
,
an
eye
large
,
black
,
and
honest
,
but
keen
and
penetrating
,
and
a
command
of
which
approached
the
marvelous
.
<EOS>
These
characteristics
of
the
young
warrior
struck
Jack
Carleton
while
pressing
the
warm
hand
of
his
new
friend
and
looking
into
his
pleasing
countenance
for
the
first
time
.
<EOS>
“I
am
delighted
to
see
you
,
”
he
said
,
recalling
the
amazing
stories
told
of
Deerfoot
by
Ned
Preston
,
and
beginning
to
think
that
,
after
all
,
they
may
have
contained
more
truth
than
fiction
.
<EOS>
Before
Jack
could
add
anything
more
,
Otto
Relstaub
,
who
was
staring
at
the
two
,
heaved
a
great
sigh
,
as
if
fearing
some
danger
would
come
upon
them
.
<EOS>
“What
is
the
matter
with
my
brother
?
”
<EOS>
asked
Deerfoot
,
looking
inquiringly
toward
him
with
his
old
smile
.
<EOS>
“I
asks
mineself
if
we
stands
here
till
all
last
night
,
<EOS>
do
n't
it?”“I
suppose
we
may
as
well
seek
more
comfortable
quarters
,
”
remarked
Jack
Carleton
,
who
turned
to
the
young
warrior
and
added
,
“
When
Deerfoot
is
present
no
one
else
dare
lead
.

What

AROUND
THE
CAMP
-
FIREOn
a
tempestuous
night
in
midwinter
the
little
settlement
of
Coatesville
,
in
Kentucky
,
was
assailed
by
a
fierce
band
of
Shawanoes
and
Hurons
.
<EOS>
The
pioneers
were
surprised
,
for
the
hour
was
near
daybreak
,
and
,
accustomed
as
they
were
to
the
forays
of
the
border
,
they
were
without
the
slightest
warning
of
the
danger
which
burst
upon
them
.
<EOS>
They
rallied
,
however
,
and
made
an
heroic
defense
,
but
when
with
the
dawning
of
day
the
warriors
withdrew
,
they
left
more
than
half
the
hearthstones
darkened
with
sorrow
and
woe
,
because
of
one
or
more
of
its
defenders
who
had
fallen
in
the
strife
.
<EOS>
Among
those
that
had
perished
was
Abram
Carleton
,
shot
down
on
his
own
threshold
while
fighting
for
his
wife
and
his
boy
Jack
,
who
themselves
were
doing
their
utmost
to
beat
back
their
merciless
enemies
.
<EOS>
The
youth
,
as
he
grew
older
,
gradually
recovered
from
his
grief
,
but
the
blow
was
so
terrible
to
the
stricken
widow
that
its
effect
remained
with
her
through
all
the
years
that
followed
.
<EOS>
The
vivacious
,
bright
-
hearted
wife
became
the
sad
,
thoughtful
woman
,
who
rarely
smiled
,
and
who
walked
forever
in
the
shadow
of
her
desolation
.
<EOS>
She
had
only
her
boy
Jack
,
and
to
him
she
gave
the
whole
wealth
of
her
attention
;
but
she
could
never
forget
the
brave
one
that
had
yielded
his
life
for
her
and
her
child
.
<EOS>
Some
years
later
a
portion
of
the
settlers
became
dissatisfied
with
their
home
,
peculiarly
exposed
as
it
was
to
attacks
from
marauding
red
men
,
and
determined
to
cross
the
Mississippi
into
that
portion
of
Louisiana
which
to
-
day
forms
the
great
State
of
Missouri
.
<EOS>
To
many
it
seemed
a
strange
refuge
,
for
the
change
,
it
may
be
said
,
took
them
still
further
from
civilization
;
but
the
reader
well
knows
that
the
settlement
of
no
portion
of
the
Union
was
marked
by
such
deeds
of
ferocity
as
that
of
the
Dark
and
Bloody
Ground
,
and
the
pioneers
had
good
grounds
to
hope
for
better
things
in
the
strange
land
toward
which
they
turned
their
footsteps
.
<EOS>
The
lead
mines
of
Missouri
attracted
notice
a
early
as
1720
,
and
Saint
Genevieve
,
its
oldest
town
,
was
founded
in
1755
.
<EOS>
At
the
breaking
out
of
the
Revolution
,
St.
Louis
contained
nearly
a
thousand
inhabitants
,
the
country
at
that
time
belonging
to
Spain
,
and
a
considerable
fur
trade
was
carried
on
with
the
Indians
.
<EOS>
Among
those
who
crossed
the
Mississippi
was
the
widow
Carleton
.
<EOS>
Her
friends
believed
that
if
she
removed
forever
from
the
scene
of
her
great
affliction
she
might
recover
;
but
if
she
remained
she
must
soon
succumb
.
<EOS>
She
suffered
herself
to
be
persuaded
,
and
went
in
the
company
of
those
who
promised
to
give
her
the
tenderest
attention
and
care
.
<EOS>
Her
decision
was
not
made
until
the
little
company
,
that
had
spent
weeks
in
preparation
,
was
on
the
eve
of
starting
.
<EOS>
It
thus
became
necessary
for
Jack
to
stay
behind
to
look
after
certain
interests
of
both
,
his
purpose
being
to
follow
in
the
course
of
a
few
weeks
.
<EOS>
The
long
journey
westward
was
made
in
safety
,
a
thriving
settlement
begun
,
and
young
Otto
Relstaub
,
the
son
of
a
hard
-
hearted
,
penurious
German
,
was
sent
back
over
the
trail
,
according
to
promise
,
to
guide
Jack
Carleton
,
who
was
impatiently
awaiting
him
.
<EOS>
The
next
morning
after
his
arrival
the
two
started
westward
,
all
their
earthly
effects
packed
upon
the
single
horse
.
<EOS>
They
took
turns
in
riding
the
animal
.
<EOS>
Accustomed
as
they
were
to
constant
activity
,
they
would
have
enjoyed
the
journey
on
foot
much
more
than
on
horseback
.
<EOS>
At
first
both
walked
,
but
,
after
their
animal
had
run
away
several
times
,
his
capture
causing
much
delay
,
trouble
,
and
roiling
of
temper
,
they
concluded
that
a
change
would
have
to
be
made
if
they
expected
ever
to
reach
their
destination
.
<EOS>
One
afternoon
,
when
Otto
was
riding
considerably
in
advance
of
his
friend
,
he
was
fired
upon
by
Indians
,
narrowly
escaping
with
his
life
.
<EOS>
The
incidents
immediately
following
have
already
been
told
the
reader
.
<EOS>
It
was
yet
early
in
the
evening
when
Deerfoot
the
Shawanoe
acted
upon
the
request
of
Otto
,
that
some
more
convenient
spot
should
be
selected
in
which
to
continue
their
talk
.
<EOS>
Inasmuch
as
the
destination
of
the
boys
lay
to
the
westward
,
it
seemed
to
Jack
Carleton
that
,
the
wisest
thing
to
do
was
to
enter
the
canoe
,
and
allow
the
young
Shawanoe
to
paddle
them
across
;
but
he
held
the
gifts
and
skill
of
the
wonderful
warrior
in
such
high
estimation
that
he
feared
a
hint
of
the
kind
might
not
be
received
with
favor
.
<EOS>
Deerfoot
led
the
way
through
the
wood
until
a
depression
was
reached
,
where
considerable
undergrowth
grew
.
<EOS>
He
came
to
a
stop
and
seemed
to
be
looking
around
in
the
darkness
,
which
to
the
others
was
impenetrable
.
<EOS>
“Let
a
fire
be
kindled
,
”
said
he
.
<EOS>
Only
a
few
minutes
were
needed
to
gather
all
the
fuel
required
.
<EOS>
It
was
heaped
against
the
trunk
of
a
tree
,
and
as
each
carried
a
flint
and
steel
,
a
bright
roaring
blaze
was
soon
under
way
.
<EOS>
Had
Jack
and
Otto
been
alone
,
they
would
have
been
troubled
by
the
fear
that
their
campfire
would
be
seen
by
prowling
enemies
but
the
air
of
unconcern
on
the
part
of
the
Shawanoe
infused
into
them
a
feeling
of
confidence
which
drove
away
all
fear
.
<EOS>
Enough
branches
and
leaves
were
piled
together
to
afford
them
the
best
sort
of
couch
.
<EOS>
Not
one
had
it
blanket
with
him
,
and
had
the
weather
been
cold
,
they
must
have
suffered
not
a
little
.
<EOS>
The
boys
had
lost
theirs
when
their
horse
ran
away
the
last
time
,
and
Deerfoot
had
not
brought
any
with
him
,
though
one
remained
in
his
canoe
.
<EOS>
Fortunately
the
night
was
not
only
mild
,
but
scarcely
a
breath
of
air
was
stirring
.
<EOS>
The
fire
radiated
all
the
heat
needed
to
make
each
comfortable
.
<EOS>
They
assumed
easy
postures
on
the
ground
,
and
,
as
the
reflection
lit
up
each
countenance
,
they
looked
curiously
at
one
another
,
as
if
seeking
more
intimate
knowledge
of
their
appearance
.
<EOS>
Deerfoot
and
Jack
have
already
been
sufficiently
referred
to
,
and
a
little
attention
is
due
to
the
honest
German
youth
,
who
has
his
part
to
play
in
the
following
pages
.
<EOS>
Otto
was
about
a
year
younger
than
his
friend
,
and
bore
very
little
resemblance
to
him
.
<EOS>
Jack
possessed
a
certain
rugged
grace
,
and
,
while
he
was
not
handsome
,
his
face
showed
intelligence
with
mental
strength
,
sustained
by
bounding
youth
,
and
a
physical
vigor
which
was
perfect
.
<EOS>
Otto
was
a
head
shorter
than
Jack
,
and
his
growth
seemed
to
run
mostly
to
breadth
.
<EOS>
His
short
legs
bowed
outward
at
the
knees
,
and
a
curve
seemed
necessary
in
order
to
preserve
the
harmony
of
general
expanse
.
<EOS>
His
face
was
very
wide
,
the
small
twinkling
eyes
fax
apart
,
and
the
funny
pug
nose
inclined
in
the
same
direction
.
<EOS>
His
neck
was
short
,
and
hair
long
and
thick
.
<EOS>
His
dress
was
similar
to
that
worn
by
Jack
Carleton
,
except
that
everything
,
even
to
the
shoes
,
were
of
the
coarsest
possible
nature
.
<EOS>
Jacob
Relstaub
,
the
father
of
Otto
,
was
not
merely
penurious
,
but
he
was
miserly
and
mean
.
<EOS>
Jack
Carleton
knew
him
so
well
that
he
was
certain
<EOS>
there
would
be
serious
trouble
with
the
lad
if
he
showed
himself
in
the
little
frontier
town
without
the
valuable
horse
which
had
run
away
and
swam
the
river
.
<EOS>
There
was
one
respect
in
which
the
dress
of
the
German
differed
from
that
of
the
American
.
<EOS>
Instead
of
wearing
a
cap
,
he
was
furnished
with
a
hat
something
similar
to
those
seen
in
some
portions
of
the
Tyrol
.
<EOS>
It
had
a
brim
of
moderate
width
,
and
the
crown
gradually
tapered
until
it
attained
a
height
of
six
inches
,
where
it
ended
in
it
point
.
<EOS>
The
thrifty
mother
possessed
a
secret
of
imparting
a
stiffness
to
the
head
gear
which
caused
it
to
keep
its
shape
,
except
when
limp
from
moisture
.
<EOS>
Such
youths
as
Otto
and
Jack
are
always
blessed
with
the
most
vigorous
appetites
,
but
they
had
eaten
during
the
afternoon
and
were
well
content
to
wait
until
the
morrow
.
<EOS>
As
for
Deerfoot
,
it
made
little
difference
to
him
whether
he
had
partaken
since
the
rising
of
the
sun
,
for
he
had
been
taught
from
his
infancy
to
hold
every
propensity
of
his
nature
in
the
sternest
check
.
<EOS>
Oft
-
times
he
went
hungry
for
no
other
purpose
than
that
of
self
-
discipline
.
<EOS>
“How
<EOS>
was
it
<EOS>
you
came
to
meet
Otto
?
”
<EOS>
asked
Jack
of
the
dusky
youth
,
who
,
assuming
an
easy
position
on
the
ground
,
was
examining
his
bow
.
<EOS>
He
looked
up
,
smiled
faintly
,
and
hesitated
a
moment
before
answering
.
<EOS>
“Two
<EOS>
suns
ago
Deerfoot
came
upon
a
log
cabin
.
<EOS>
It
was
raining
and
cold
,
and
he
was
a
long
ways
from
home
.
<EOS>
He
saw
the
glimmer
of
a
light
and
reached
for
the
latch
-
string
,
but
it
was
pulled
in
.
<EOS>
He
knocked
on
the
door
and
it
was
opened
by
the
man
who
lived
there
.
<EOS>
Deerfoot
asked
that
he
might
stay
till
morning
,
but
the
pale
face
called
him
an
Indian
dog
,
and
said
that
if
he
did
not
hasten
away
he
would
shoot
him—”“Don't
you
know
who
dot
vos
?
”
<EOS>
interrupted
Otto
,
whose
face
seemed
to
grow
wider
with
its
immense
grin
.
<EOS>
“How
<EOS>
should
I
know
.
”
<EOS>
asked
Jack
,
in
turn
.
<EOS>
“Dot
was
mine
fader
.
<EOS>
I
dinks
yon
<EOS>
vosn't
<EOS>
such
a
fool
dot
<EOS>
you
would
n't
know
dot
right
away
.
<EOS>
”“I
knew
that
he
was
the
stingiest
man
in
Kentucky
,
but
I
did
n't
suppose
you
spelled
his
name
'
h
-
o
-
g
.
<EOS>
”'“Dot
's
just
de
way
to
spell
it
,
”
said
Otto
,
slapping
his
friend
on
the
shoulder
and
laughing
as
though
pleased
beyond
measure
.
<EOS>
“
Wait
till
you
do
n't
know
him
as
well
as
I
don't
.
”“Deerfoot
<EOS>
turned
to
walk
away
,
”
continued
the
young
Shawanoe
;
“
he
had
slept
many
times
in
the
wood
,
and
he
was
not
afraid
,
but
he
had
not
taken
many
steps
when
some
one
called
him
.
<EOS>
It
was
too
dark
to
see
,
but
the
voice
was
of
a
boy
.
<EOS>
While
Deerfoot
waited
he
threw
a
heavy
,
blanket
over
his
shoulders
and
made
Deerfoot
walk
back
to
the
cabin
.
<EOS>
He
asked
him
to
enter
the
window
where
the
father
could
not
see
him
,
and
he
told
Deerfoot
he
would
place
him
in
his
bed
and
he
should
have
food
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
narrator
paused
in
his
story
and
glanced
toward
Otto
Relstaub
.
<EOS>
Jack
,
with
a
laugh
,
looked
at
the
stubby
youngster
,
who
was
blushing
deeply
and
holding
one
hand
over
his
face
,
the
fingers
spread
so
far
apart
that
he
could
see
the
others
.
<EOS>
Otto
was
also
smiling
,
and
his
hand
could
not
begin
to
hide
it
,
so
that
each
side
of
his
mouth
wits
in
sight
.
<EOS>
“Deerfoot
was
too
proud
to
receive
the
offer
of
the
boy
,
but
he
took
the
blanket
.
<EOS>
”“And
<EOS>
mine
gracious
!
”
<EOS>
struck
in
the
lad
again
;
“
did
n't
mine
fader
whip
me
for
dat
?
<EOS>
He
proke
up
three
hickory
sticks
onto
me
and
kept
me
dancing
out
of
de
cabin
and
in
again
,
and
over
the
roof
,
till
I
vos
so
disgusted
as
nefer
vos
.
<EOS>
”“How
<EOS>
did
you
explain
the
absence
of
the
blanket
?
”
<EOS>
asked
Jack
.
<EOS>
“I
told
mine
fader
<EOS>
I
did
n't
know
not
any
nodings
apout
it
,
and
he
whipped
me
'cause
I
did
n't
know
vot
I
did
know
,
and
,
when
Deerfoot
brought
pack
de
blanket
next
day
,
den
<EOS>
he
knows
dat
<EOS>
I
lied
and
he
whipped
some
more
as
nefer
pefore
.
<EOS>
”Jack
<EOS>
Carleton
threw
back
his
bead
and
laughed
,
though
he
took
care
that
he
made
little
noise
in
doing
so
;
but
the
face
of
the
Shawanoe
was
grave
.
<EOS>
His
refined
nature
could
see
nothing
mirthful
in
the
cruel
punishment
inflicted
upon
the
boy
because
he
did
a
kindness
to
a
stranger
of
another
race
.
<EOS>
The
brutal
father
had
only
to
thank
the
Christian
restraint
of
Deerfoot
that
he
was
not
pierced
by
an
arrow
from
his
bow
for
his
conduct
.
<EOS>
The
Shawanoe
did
not
need
explain
that
the
little
act
of
Otto
had
secured
his
lasting
gratitude
.
<EOS>
The
latter
was
not
one
to
seek
his
company
or
intrude
himself
upon
him
;
but
he
was
ready
to
do
the
young
German
any
service
in
his
power
.
<EOS>
A
few
days
before
,
when
Deerfoot
was
returning
from
the
direction
of
the
Mississippi
,
he
met
Otto
on
horseback
.
<EOS>
The
latter
told
him
he
was
going
to
Coatesville
to
bring
back
a
young
friend
,
whose
mother
was
in
the
new
settlement
.
<EOS>
For
some
reason
,
which
the
Shawanoe
did
not
make
known
,
he
could
not
accompany
Otto
,
or
he
would
have
done
so
;
but
he
gave
him
full
directions
and
numerous
suggestions
,
every
one
of
which
Otto
forgot
within
the
following
fifteen
minutes
.
<EOS>
Deerfoot
,
however
,
after
making
some
calculations
as
to
the
time
the
boys
would
reach
the
Mississippi
on
their
return
,
promised
to
meet
them
there
and
to
take
them
across
in
his
canoe
,
which
was
hidden
not
far
away
.
<EOS>
The
Shawanoe
particularly
instructed
Otto
that
,
if
the
meeting
should
take
place
at
night
,
he
would
make
known
his
departure
from
the
Louisiana
side
by
swinging
a
torch
in
a
circular
manner
.
<EOS>
It
was
this
signal
which
recalled
the
agreement
to
the
mind
of
Otto
Relstaub
,
who
remembered
much
more
than
he
would
have
<EOS>
Jack
Carleton
believe
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
VI
.
<EOS>
NIGHT
AND
MORNINGDeerfoot
made
known
his
purpose
to
take
his
friends
across
the
Mississippi
on
the
morrow
in
his
canoe
,
after
which
he
would
keep
them
company
for
some
distance
along
the
trail
,
though
he
would
be
forced
to
leave
them
long
before
reaching
their
destination
.
<EOS>
Jack
Carleton
naturally
felt
a
deep
interest
in
the
youthful
warrior
,
and
expected
him
to
give
some
facts
in
his
wonderful
history
,
as
well
as
an
intimation
of
what
his
life
was
likely
to
be
in
the
new
country
to
which
he
had
removed
,
but
much
to
the
young
Kentuckian
's
disappointment
,
he
carefully
avoided
all
reference
to
himself
.
<EOS>
His
conversation
being
of
such
a
nature
that
it
is
hardly
worth
recording
in
this
place
.
<EOS>
When
the
evening
was
well
along
,
Otto
threw
more
wood
on
the
flames
which
crackled
and
gave
out
a
cheerful
glow
.
<EOS>
Deerfoot
rose
to
his
feet
,
and
without
a
word
passed
out
into
the
gloom
.
<EOS>
The
hour
for
retiring
was
close
at
hand
,
and
he
preferred
to
make
a
reconnaissance
before
trusting
themselves
to
slumber
.
<EOS>
He
returned
as
noiselessly
as
he
went
,
remarking
as
he
resumed
his
seat
that
no
danger
whatever
threatened
them
,
and
they
could
slumber
in
peace
.
<EOS>
While
speaking
,
he
drew
from
a
pocket
within
the
skirt
of
his
bunting
-
shirt
,
the
little
Bible
which
had
been
presented
to
him
months
before
by
Mrs.
Preston
of
Wild
Oaks
,
after
the
other
volume
was
destroyed
by
the
bullet
that
was
aimed
at
the
heart
of
the
youth
,
by
the
hostile
chieftain
.
<EOS>
Adjusting
himself
in
an
easy
posture
on
the
ground
,
so
that
the
ruddy
fire
-
light
came
over
his
shoulders
and
fell
upon
the
page
with
its
minute
letters
,
the
young
Shawanoe
read
for
several
minutes
to
himself
.
<EOS>
The
others
held
their
peace
,
impressed
with
the
singular
sight
.
<EOS>
Neither
could
doubt
that
he
clearly
comprehended
every
word
of
the
sublime
volume
,
and
they
felt
that
it
was
wrong
to
break
in
upon
his
meditation
.
<EOS>
All
at
once
he
raised
his
head
and
asked
,
“
Would
my
brothers
wish
to
hear
Deerfoot
read?”“We
would
,
indeed
,
”
was
the
reply
of
Jack
Carleton
;
“
I
never
saw
an
Indian
who
could
read
from
a
,
printed
book
,
but
I
have
been
told
that
you
can
write
an
excellent
hand
.
<EOS>
”Deerfoot
shook
his
head
disparagingly
.
<EOS>
“My
brother
mistakes
,
but
Deerfoot
will
try
and
read
the
words
which
the
Great
Spirit
speaks
to
all
his
people
,
whether
they
are
pale
faces
or
red
men
.
<EOS>
”And
<EOS>
then
,
in
a
low
musical
voice
,
tremulous
with
emotion
and
impressive
beyond
description
,
the
Shawanoe
read
an
entire
chapter
from
the
book
of
Revelations
,
his
favorite
portion
of
the
blessed
Book
,
the
others
listening
spellbound
.
<EOS>
Even
Otto
Relstaub
,
who
saw
and
heard
little
of
genuine
Christian
teachings
in
his
cheerless
home
,
was
touched
as
never
before
by
the
indescribably
solemn
story
of
the
apocalyptic
vision
.
<EOS>
The
silence
which
succeeded
lasted
several
minutes
,
when
Jack
said
in
a
low
voice:“Deerfoot
,
I
wish
you
would
speak
some
sentences
from
the
Bible
in
your
own
tongue
.
<EOS>
”“Does
<EOS>
my
brother
wish
to
learn
the
Shawanoe
language?”“I
have
heard
Shawanoes
,
Hurons
and
Miamis
talk
,
but
I
ca
n't
understand
a
word
;
I
have
a
curiosity
to
know
how
it
will
sound
to
hear
some
parts
of
the
Bible
with
which
I
am
familiar
tittered
in
an
unknown
tongue
.
<EOS>
”“What
<EOS>
part
of
the
book
<EOS>
can
my
brother
repeat
without
reading
the
words?”“Well
—
that
is
—
I
do
n't
know
<EOS>
,
”
replied
Jack
,
confused
by
the
question
of
Deerfoot
,
who
fixed
his
eyes
inquiringly
upon
him
;
“
I
mean
any
sentence
.
<EOS>
”“Does
<EOS>
my
brother
not
read
the
Bible
every
day
?
”
<EOS>
asked
the
Indian
,
in
a
grieved
rather
than
a
reproving
voice
;
“
he
must
know
the
Lord
's
Prayer—”“O
<EOS>
yes
,
yes
,
”
replied
Jack
,
desperately
clutching
at
the
single
straw
.
<EOS>
“
I
meant
to
ask
you
to
repeat
that
.
”In
<EOS>
the
same
low
,
reverent
voice
he
had
used
while
reading
,
the
warrior
uttered
the
inspired
petition
,
which
shall
last
through
all
time
.
<EOS>
When
he
had
finished
,
he
said:“My
brother
would
like
to
remember
the
words
as
Deerfoot
has
spoken
them
;
Deerfoot
will
print
them
for
him
.
<EOS>
”And
<EOS>
drawing
a
species
of
red
chalk
from
the
same
pocket
which
held
the
Bible
,
he
wrote
for
several
minutes
on
one
of
the
fly
-
leaves
of
the
bock
.
<EOS>
When
he
had
finished
he
glanced
over
the
words
,
carefully
tore
out
the
leaf
and
handed
it
across
to
Jack
.
<EOS>
The
latter
examined
the
paper
,
and
saw
written
in
a
fine
,
delicate
hand
the
following
words
,
which
are
preserved
to
this
day
,
and
which
,
when
properly
pronounced
,
constitute
the
Lord
's
Prayer
as
it
has
been
uttered
many
a
time
by
the
dusky
lips
of
the
Shawanoe
warrior
,
when
his
fiery
nature
was
subdued
by
its
blessed
teachings:“Coe

<EOS>
”Jack
studied
the
singular
words
several
minutes
,
and
then
,
with
some
hesitation
,
undertook
to
pronounce
them
.
<EOS>
He
did
only
fairly
,
even
when
corrected
by
Deerfoot
,
who
added
the
rebuke:“Let
<EOS>
my
brother
say
them
over
many
times
in
his
own
language
,
for
the
Great
Spirit
knows
all
tongues
when
he
who
speaks
the
words
speaks
them
with
his
heart
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
consciousness
that
these
words
were
uttered
by
one
who
belonged
to
what
is
generally
regarded
its
a
pagan
race
,
brought
a
blush
to
the
face
of
the
sturdy
youth
that
had
listened
to
the
same
appeal
more
than
once
from
the
lips
of
his
mother
.
<EOS>
Under
the
assurance
of
Deerfoot
,
the
boys
stretched
themselves
on
the
leaves
and
branches
and
soon
sunk
into
a
refreshing
slumber
.
<EOS>
Jack
recalled
that
his
last
remembrance
was
of
Deerfoot
resting
his
head
on
his
elbow
,
while
he
seemed
absorbed
in
his
book
.
<EOS>
He
lay
as
motionless
as
a
figure
in
bronze
,
but
no
matter
how
much
he
might
be
enchained
by
the
words
,
he
could
not
be
insensible
of
what
was
going
on
around
him
.
<EOS>
Both
Jack
and
Otto
slept
until
the
light
of
morning
was
stealing
through
the
woods
.
<EOS>
Then
,
when
they
arose
to
their
feet
,
they
saw
the
Shawanoe
broiling
a
couple
of
whitefish
which
he
had
managed
to
coax
from
the
Mississippi
.
<EOS>
He
had
almost
finished
before
his
friends
suspected
what
was
doing
.
<EOS>
After
greeting
the
warrior
,
the
others
passed
through
the
woods
to
the
margin
of
the
mighty
river
,
where
they
bathed
their
faces
and
hands
,
took
a
slight
swallow
of
the
somewhat
muddy
water
and
then
rejoined
Deerfoot
,
who
had
their
breakfast
ready
.
<EOS>
“Did
<EOS>
my
brothers
see
any
signs
that
frightened
them
?
”
<EOS>
asked
Deerfoot
,
when
the
three
had
seated
themselves
on
the
ground
and
were
partaking
of
their
meal
.
<EOS>
“I
took
the
best
survey
I
could
of
the
river
,
”
replied
Jack
,
“
but
saw
nothing
of
friend
or
foe
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
suppose
,
as
a
rule
,
there
are
many
Indians
in
this
section
.
<EOS>
”“The
Shawanoes
often
hunt
to
the
river
,
but
do
not
cross
;
the
Miamis
come
down
from
the
north
,
and
Deerfoot
sees
their
footprints
in
the
Woods
.
<EOS>
”“What
<EOS>
tribes
are
we
likely
to
meet
on
the
other
side
of
the
Mississippi
?
”
<EOS>
asked
the
young
Kentuckian
,
who
naturally
felt
much
interest
in
the
land
wherein
he
expected
to
make
his
home
.
<EOS>
“There
are
many
red
men
,
even
to
the
mountains
which
stretch
far
beyond
the
rivers
and
prairies
,
and
raise
their
heads
among
the
clouds
.
<EOS>
”Jack
<EOS>
Carleton
was
surprised
at
this
reference
,
which
,
he
believed
,
was
to
the
Rocky
Mountains
,
of
which
little
more
than
their
simple
existence
was
known
to
the
rest
of
the
Union
at
that
day
.
<EOS>
But
the
words
which
followed
astonished
him
still
more:“Beyond
<EOS>
the
mountains
opens
the
great
sea
,
wider
than
that
which
the
pale
faces
came
across
from
the
Old
World
;
beyond
that
great
sea
lies
the
land
where
He
died
for
you
and
me
;
all
the
way
to
the
shore
,
of
the
great
water
<EOS>
you
will
find
the
red
men
;
they
are
like
the
leaves
in
the
woods
,
and
Deerfoot
and
his
friends
will
die
without
ever
hearing
their
names
.
<EOS>
”“But
<EOS>
you
have
spent
some
time
on
the
other
side
the
Mississippi
,
and
must
know
something
of
your
race
there
.
<EOS>
”“Deerfoot
<EOS>
has
seen
the
Osages
hunting
among
the
mountains
and
in
the
forest
;
has
seen
the
Miamis
,
and
,
to
the
northward
,
may
be
met
the
Sacs
and
Foxes
.
<EOS>
Far
toward
the
ice
of
the
North
is
the
land
of
the
Assiniboine
and
the
Dacotah
.
<EOS>
”“I
should
like
to
know
where
you
gathered
all
that
information
?
”
<EOS>
remarked
the
amazed
Jack
Carleton
;
“
the
country
beyond
the
Mississippi
is
greater
than
that
on
this
side
,
and
one
of
these
days
it
will
overflow
with
population
,
then
what
a
country
ours
will
be
!
”
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
young
patriot
,
with
kindling
eye
.
<EOS>
“
But
you
and
I
,
Deerfoot
,
can
never
live
to
see
that
time
,
which
is
for
those
that
come
after
us
.
<EOS>
”“Yaw
<EOS>
,
”
said
Otto
,
seeming
to
feel
it
his
duty
to
say
something
;
“
dere
is
enough
land
over
dere
<EOS>
,
I
'
spose
,
for
that
horse
to
hide
a
week
before
I
do
n't
catch
him
.
<EOS>
”Jack
<EOS>
intimated
that
he
was
likely
to
find
his
search
extended
beyond
that
time
,
while
Deerfoot
smiled
over
the
simplicity
of
the
lad
,
whose
information
was
so
small
compared
with
his
opportunities
.
<EOS>
Conversing
in
this
pleasant
manner
,
the
meal
was
soon
finished
,
and
they
made
ready
to
cross
the
river
.
<EOS>
When
the
three
emerged
from
the
woods
they
were
close
to
the
swiftly
flowing
current
.
<EOS>
Jack
and
Otto
paused
,
while
Deerfoot
walked
the
few
rods
necessary
to
find
the
canoe
that
had
been
drawn
up
the
bank
.
<EOS>
Both
the
boys
could
swim
the
Mississippi
if
necessary
,
though
,
with
their
rifles
and
clothing
to
take
care
of
,
it
was
anything
but
a
light
task
.
<EOS>
Had
they
been
without
any
boat
at
command
,
they
would
have
divested
themselves
of
their
garments
and
placed
them
and
their
“
luggage
”
on
it
small
float
,
while
they
swam
behind
and
pushed
it
forward
.
<EOS>
When
the
emigrants
moved
westward
they
halted
long
enough
on
the
bank
to
construct
a
raft
,
sufficient
to
carry
everything
in
the
course
of
several
trips
back
and
forth
.
<EOS>
Otto
made
preparation
when
he
reached
the
river
some
days
before
on
horseback
,
and
,
forcing
the
animal
into
the
current
,
slipped
back
,
grasped
his
tail
and
allowed
himself
to
be
towed
across
.
<EOS>
He
might
have
done
the
same
on
the
preceding
day
<EOS>
had
he
been
given
a
few
minutes
in
which
to
make
preparation
,
and
had
he
not
been
unwilling
to
leave
his
friend
behind
.
<EOS>
“But
<EOS>
it
will
beat
all
that
,
”
remarked
Jack
Carleton
,
after
they
had
discussed
the
different
plans
,
“
to
be
paddled
over
in
the
canoe
of
Deerfoot
.
<EOS>
”“Yaw
,
<EOS>
but
I
dinks
dot
we
should
go
across
last
,
night
.
<EOS>
”“What
<EOS>
would
we
have
gained
by
that?”“Then
we
would
n't
have
to
go
ober
agin
dis
mornings
.
<EOS>
”“True
<EOS>
,
<EOS>
but
there
is
no
haste
called
for
;
if
it
was
not
that
I
am
so
anxious
to
see
mother
,
I
would
as
lief
spend
a
week
on
the
road
.
<EOS>
”“Dot
would
n't
do
for

,
for
mine
fader
would
be
looking
for
me
wid
two
big
gads
to
him—”“Helloa
!
<EOS>
Here
comes
Deerfoot
.
<EOS>
What
can
be
the
matter
?
<EOS>
He
is
excited
over
something
.
<EOS>
”Such
was
the
fact
,
indeed
,
for
the
sagacious
Shawanoe
had
made
an
annoying
if
not
alarming
discovery
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
VII
.
<EOS>
A
SURPRISED
FISHERMANIt
may
be
said
that
Deerfoot
the
Shawanoe
never
lost
his
senses
excepting
when
slumber
stole
them
away
.
<EOS>
Young
as
he
was
,
he
had
been
through
some
of
the
most
terrific
encounters
the
mind
can
conceive
,
and
yet
,
when
he
stood
erect
in
the
full
glare
of
the
noonday
sun
,
not
a
scratch
or
scar
spoke
of
those
fearful
affrays
in
the
depth
of
the
forest
,
among
the
hills
and
mountains
and
along
the
Shores
of
the
rivers
of
Kentucky
and
Ohio
.
<EOS>
I
have
said
that
he
was
so
hated
by
his
own
people
that
he
felt
his
presence
near
the
settlements
to
the
eastward
was
more
to
the
disadvantage
than
the
help
of
his
friends
,
and
that
was
one
of
the
causes
which
led
him
to
bid
adieu
forever
to
his
friends
.
<EOS>
It
has
been
intimated
also
that
still
another
reason
actuated
him
,
and
that
reason
shall
appear
in
due
time
.
<EOS>
When
Deerfoot
assured
Jack
Carleton
and
Otto
Relstaub
that
they
might
slumber
in
peace
,
he
spoke
the
truth
;
it
has
been
shown
that
not
the
first
breath
of
danger
touched
them
during
the
darkness
,
and
the
morning
meal
was
partaken
in
the
same
enjoyable
fashion
.
<EOS>
But
before
the
subtle
young
Shawanoe
reached
the
spot
where
he
left
his
canoe
,
he
was
disturbed
by
discovering
the
imprint
of
moccasins
along
shore
.
<EOS>
They
led
away
from
his
friends
and
toward
the
canoe
.
<EOS>
A
few
minutes
showed
the
latter
had
“
received
”
some
visitors
since
its
owner
left
it
.
<EOS>
It
was
utterly
destroyed
.
<EOS>
The
knives
and
tomahawks
of
several
,
warriors
had
hacked
be
bark
structure
to
pieces
.
<EOS>
Even
the
paddle
had
been
broken
into
a
half
dozen
parts
.
<EOS>
Nothing
was
left
of
which
use
could
be
made
,
the
blanket
of
the
owner
of
course
being
absent
.
<EOS>
Deerfoot
looked
on
the
wreck
with
something
like
dismay
,
which
speedily
turned
to
anger
.
<EOS>
The
wantonness
of
the
act
roiled
his
feelings
and
stirred
up
the
“
old
Indian
”
in
his
nature
.
<EOS>
He
surveyed
the
destruction
for
a
minute
or
two
,
and
then
made
a
careful
examination
of
the
signs
the
perpetrators
could
not
avoid
leaving
behind
them
.
<EOS>
There
had
been
three
Indiana
engaged
in
the
mischief
,
and
<EOS>
the
first
supposition
of
Deerfoot
was
that
they
were
the
Shawanoes
whom
Jack
Carleton
saw
the
day
previous
;
but
a
few
minutes
'
study
of
the
footprints
betrayed
a
certain
peculiarity
(
a
slight
turning
outward
of
the
left
foot
<EOS>
so
slight
,
indeed
,
as
almost
to
be
imperceptible
)
,
which
identified
them
as
Miamis
.
<EOS>
Deerfoot
had
noticed
the
“
sign
manual
”
years
before
,
so
there
was
no
room
for
mistake
on
his
part
.
<EOS>
The
party
had
come
down
from
the
northward
,
most
likely
with
other
warriors
,
and
had
stumbled
by
mere
chance
upon
the
partially
hidden
canoe
.
<EOS>
They
probably
investigated
matters
enough
to
learn
that
it
was
in
charge
of
two
white
persons
and
one
red
one
—
enough
to
satisfy
them
that
the
single
Indian
was
friendly
to
the
settlers
,
and
therefore
one
to
be
despised
and
harried
in
every
way
possible
.
<EOS>
It
was
that
discovery
which
undoubtedly
caused
them
to
destroy
the
property
and
steal
the
blanket
.
<EOS>
They
were
not
enough
interested
to
seek
the
lives
of
the
others
,
though
it
may
be
they
were
restrained
by
fear
from
doing
so
.
<EOS>
When
Deerfoot
came
back
to
the
boys
,
he
purposely
displayed
some
excitement
in
order
to
amuse
them
.
<EOS>
He
quickly
explained
what
he
had
learned
,
and
then
,
in
the
most
indifferent
voice
and
manner
,
said
“
The
Miamis
shall
pay
Deerfoot
for
his
canoe
.
<EOS>
”“How
<EOS>
will
you
make
them
do
that
?
”
<EOS>
asked
Jack
,
who
noticed
the
peculiar
sparkle
which
the
friends
of
the
warrior
always
observed
when
his
feelings
were
stirred
.
<EOS>
“I
does
n't
not
believes
dot
you
and
dem
can
not
agrees
mit
de
price
,
”
said
Otto
;
“
derefore
you
sends
for
me
<EOS>
and
I
tells
you
what
de
price
ai
n't
,
and
if
dey
do
n't
agrees
,
den
<EOS>
I
knocks
<EOS>
'em
ober
de
head
—
<EOS>
don't
it?”“Deerfoot
will
not
need
his
brother
,
”
said
the
Indian
,
gravely
;
“
but
he
asks
his
brothers
to
wait
till
he
comes
back”“We'll
do
that
,
”
said
Jack
;
“
that
is
,
as
long
as
there
is
a
prospect
of
your
return
.
<EOS>
When
shall
we
expect
you?”“Deerfoot
will
be
with
his
brothers
before
the
sun
reaches
yonder
.
<EOS>
”He
<EOS>
pointed
to
the
place
in
the
sky
which
the
orb
would
touch
about
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
.
<EOS>
Then
,
warning
the
two
to
be
very
careful
,
and
to
keep
continual
watch
against
detection
,
he
moved
away
,
vanishing
from
sight
in
the
woods
behind
them
,
instead
of
keeping
close
to
the
shore
.
<EOS>
He
wept
to
the
southward
until
he
once
more
reached
the
spot
which
contained
the
remains
of
his
canoe
.
<EOS>
He
spent
another
minute
in
grimly
surveying
the
ruins
,
and
then
,
glancing
down
at
the
footprints
,
followed
their
direction
.
<EOS>
He
had
determined
to
call
the
scamps
to
account
for
the
injury
done
him
.
<EOS>
As
they
belonged
to
the
Miami
tribe
,
it
was
quite
likely
they
had
a
boat
with
them
,
though
their
hunting
-
grounds
were
east
of
the
Mississippi
,
and
possibly
they
had
other
property
upon
which
the
offended
Shawanoe
meant
to
levy
.
<EOS>
He
followed
the
trail
for
nearly
a
furlong
,
when
it
divided
;
two
of
the
warriors
turned
to
the
left
and
went
deeper
into
the
woods
,
while
the
third
continued
down
stream
in
the
same
general
direction
as
before
.
<EOS>
The
sagacious
Shawanoe
suspected
the
truth
;
the
single
Indian
had
gone
to
look
after
a
canoe
or
something
which
lay
close
to
the
river
,
while
the
others
were
about
to
engage
in
a
hunt
of
so
kind
.
<EOS>
The
discovery
pleased
Deerfoot
;
for
,
beside
indicating
that
there
was
a
boat
for
him
to
take
it
showed
that
he
had
but
a
single
red
man
to
meet
.
<EOS>
Within
less
than
a
hundred
yards
this
solitary
warrior
was
found
.
<EOS>
A
large
canoe
,
evidently
belonging
to
the
three
warriors
,
or
possibly
a
larger
party
,
lay
against
the
bank
,
with
one
end
on
the
land
,
while
the
other
projected
several
yards
into
the
river
.
<EOS>
In
the
stern
sat
an
Indian
,
after
the
fashion
of
a
civilized
man
;
he
was
astride
of
the
end
,
his
moccasins
banging
over
,
one
on
either
side
,
his
back
toward
shore
,
while
he
leaned
forward
and
sleepily
watched
a
fish
-
line
,
one
end
of
which
rested
in
his
hand
,
while
the
other
was
far
out
in
the
Mississippi
.
<EOS>
His
attitude
was
as
lazy
and
contented
as
though
he
were
a
white
man
.
<EOS>
It
looked
as
if
he
had
chosen
the
sport
while
his
companions
were
off
on
a
hunt
that
required
more
effort
and
exertion
.
<EOS>
Deerfoot
stood
only
a
few
seconds
,
when
he
smiled
more
fully
than
he
had
done
for
along
time
.
<EOS>
He
saw
his
opportunity
,
and
he
proceeded
straightway
to
“
improve
”
it
.
<EOS>
He
stole
forward
,
as
quietly
as
a
shadow
,
until
he
had
gone
the
few
yards
intervening
.
<EOS>
All
that
he
feared
was
that
the
aboriginal
fisherman
might
obtain
a
bite
before
the
boat
was
reached
.
<EOS>
If
he
could
catch
a
fish
on
his
bone
hook
,
he
would
be
likely
to
fling
him
into
the
canoe
behind
him
and
to
turn
himself
around
.
<EOS>
From
the
moment
Deerfoot
placed
eyes
on
the
motionless
figure
,
he
felt
he
was
master
of
the
situation
;
but
,
with
his
usual
quickness
,
he
had
formed
his
plan
and
was
desirous
of
carrying
it
out
in
spirit
and
in
letter
.
<EOS>
Reaching
the
canoe
,
he
laid
his
long
bow
on
the
ground
beside
it
;
then
,
stooping
over
,
he
seized
the
gunwale
with
both
hands
and
,
quickly
as
the
blow
of
a
panther
,
he
jerked
the
craft
slightly
more
than
a
foot
further
up
the
bank
.
<EOS>
The
result
was
inevitable
.
<EOS>
The
astonished
Miami
sprawled
forward
from
his
seat
and
went
down
into
the
muddy
Mississippi
out
of
sight
,
doubtless
frightening
away
the
fish
that
was
nibbling
at
his
bait
.
<EOS>
“Hooh
!
”
<EOS>
he
groaned
,
ejecting
the
water
from
his
mouth
as
he
came
to
view
,
and
following
it
with
an
expression
much
in
the
nature
of
an
expletive
.
<EOS>
Only
a
couple
of
strokes
were
needed
to
bring
him
into
the
shallow
water
,
when
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
walked
out
upon
dry
land
.
<EOS>
Up
to
that
moment
he
did
not
know
the
cause
of
his
mishap
,
for
the
author
stooped
down
on
the
upper
side
of
the
craft
;
but
as
the
Miami
stepped
out
,
Deerfoot
rose
to
his
full
height
,
with
his
keen
tomahawk
grasped
in
his
left
hand
—
that
being
his
best
one
.
<EOS>
The
dripping
warrior
,
to
put
it
mildly
,
was
astonished
,
when
he
found
himself
confronted
by
the
stranger
.
<EOS>
He
stood
staring
and
speechless
,
while
the
mouth
of
Deerfoot
again
expanded
.
<EOS>
“Does
<EOS>
my
brother
's
heart
grow
weary
that
he
seeks
to
urge
the
fish
to
bite
his
hook
before
they
are
ready
?
”
<EOS>
asked
the
Shawanoe
in
the
Miami
tongue
.
<EOS>
It
was
all
clear
to
the
victim
,
and
,
when
he
understood
the
trick
that
had
been
played
upon
him
,
his
anger
showed
through
the
paint
daubed
on
his
face
.
<EOS>
“The
Shawanoe
is
a
fool
,
”
he
replied
.
<EOS>
“
His
heart
is
filled
with
joy
when
he
acts
like
a
papoose
.
<EOS>
”“But
<EOS>
he
will
now
act
like
a
warrior
,
”
said
Deerfoot
,
in
a
sterner
manner
.
<EOS>
“
The
dogs
of
the
Miamis
broke
the
canoe
of
the
Shawanoe
and
stole
his
blanket
.
<EOS>
”“The
Shawanoe
is
the
friend
of
the
white
man
,
”
said
the
other
with
a
sneer
,
though
not
without
some
misgiving
,
for
,
to
use
the
language
of
the
West
,
the
young
warrior
“
had
the
drop
on
him
.
”
<EOS>
He
had
only
to
make
one
movement
in
order
to
drive
the
glittering
weapon
through
the
skull
of
the
Miami
,
as
though
it
were
mere
card
-
board
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
confessed
that
he
looked
very
much
as
if
such
was
his
intention
.
<EOS>
“Deerfoot
is
the
friend
of
the
white
man
,
”
repeated
the
Shawanoe
;
“
he
hoped
to
paddle
them
across
the
great
river
.
<EOS>
The
Miami
dogs
have
broken
his
canoe
,
so
Deerfoot
will
take
their
boat
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
warrior
showed
that
he
was
astounded
by
the
daring
of
the
youth
.
<EOS>
Within
the
canoe
lay
the
blanket
of
Deerfoot
,
beside
the
rifle
;
powder
-
horn
,
and
bullet
pouch
,
doubtless
owned
by
the
moist
fisherman
.
<EOS>
The
latter
looked
at
his
property
as
if
he
could
not
believe
any
one
would
dare
molest
that
;
but
Deerfoot
settled
the
question
in
his
terse
fashion
.
<EOS>
“Let
the
dog
of
a
Miami
seat
himself
on
the
ground
like
a
squaw
,
and
watch
his
Shawanoe
master
while
he
takes
the
canoe
and
all
that
it
holds
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
Miami
stared
at
his
conqueror
as
if
uncertain
whether
he
had
heard
aright
.
<EOS>
The
conqueror
enlightened
him
.
<EOS>
“The
dog
of
a
Miami
longs
to
go
to
the
happy
hunting
-
grounds
of
his
fathers
.
<EOS>
”As
<EOS>
he
uttered
the
words
,
he
quickly
feinted
with
the
hand
grasping
the
tomahawk
.
<EOS>
The
warrior
made
such
a
sudden
start
to
obey
that
his
moccasins
slipped
on
the
wetter
earth
,
his
feet
spread
apart
,
as
though
he
were
learning
to
skate
,
and
he
sat
down
with
such
a
sudden
bump
that
it
forced
a
grunt
from
him
.
<EOS>
He
hastily
scrambled
up
,
and
,
with
a
frightened
glance
over
his
shoulder
,
sprang
forward
and
sat
down
again
,
though
the
last
time
was
according
to
instructions
.
<EOS>
It
required
all
the
self
-
restraint
of
Deerfoot
to
suppress
his
mirth
over
the
ridiculous
performance
of
his
captive
,
if
such
he
may
be
called
.
<EOS>
When
,
the
Miami
seated
himself
with
a
grotesque
effort
at
dignity
,
the
Shawanoe
placed
his
bow
in
the
front
of
the
canoe
and
then
shoved
the
boat
into
the
stream
.
<EOS>
As
it
shot
from
the
shore
,
he
leaped
in
,
and
caught
up
one
of
the
long
three
paddles
with
which
it
was
navigated
.
<EOS>
Dipping
it
beneath
the
surface
he
made
one
prodigious
sweep
,
which
drove
the
craft
swiftly
ahead
.
<EOS>
While
thus
employed
the
Miami
faithfully
obeyed
orders
.
<EOS>
He
sat
immobile
and
silent
,
watching
the
daring
young
warrior
making
off
not
only
with
his
private
property
,
but
with
that
which
belonged
to
others
.
<EOS>
The
Miami
must
have
thought
to
himself
more
than
once—“Ah
,
if
my
comrades
would
only
appear
at
this
moment
!
<EOS>
They
would
make
you
change
your
tune
very
soon
.
<EOS>
”All
<EOS>
at
once
the
warrior
uttered
a
whoop
which
plainly
was
meant
as
a
signal
to
his
friends
.
<EOS>
Instantly
Deerfoot
laid
down
his
paddle
,
and
,
catching
up
the
gun
,
pointed
it
at
the
redskin
.
<EOS>
The
latter
,
in
the
extremity
of
his
terror
,
turned
a
somersault
backwards
,
and
tumbled
and
scrambled
into
the
woods
,
desperately
striving
to
get
beyond
sight
of
the
terrible
youth
who
showed
such
recklessness
in
handling
weapons
.
<EOS>
No
doubt
the
Miami
believed
his
escape
was
a
narrow
one
,
when
,
the
next
instant
,
the
rifle
was
discharged
and
the
bullet
cut
through
the
leaves
near
his
face
.
<EOS>
And
so
,
in
truth
,
his
escape
was
very
narrow
,
but
it
was
just
as
narrow
as
Deerfoot
chose
to
make
it
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
the
remotest
intention
of
injuring
the
Miami
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
VIII
.
<EOS>
BEHIND
<EOS>
THE
TREEThe
report
of
the
gun
reached
the
ears
of
Otto
and
Jack
,
and
naturally
caused
them
alarm
.
<EOS>
They
hurriedly
made
their
way
to
the
edge
of
the
river
and
peered
out
from
cover
,
not
forgetting
the
warnings
previously
given
by
Deerfoot
.
<EOS>
They
had
but
to
look
a
short
distance
down
stream
to
see
the
Shawanoe
paddling
the
large
Indian
canoe
toward
the
other
shore
.
<EOS>
“Well
,
dere
!
”
exclaimed
Otto
.
<EOS>
“
Deerfoot
dinks
as
how
I
ain'ty
forgotful
,
but
do
n't
he
forget
more
than
I
does
,
when
he
dinks
he
has
us
in
the
canoe
<EOS>
and
we
be
here?”“There
<EOS>
is
no
danger
of
that
,
”
said
Jack
;
“
he
knows
it
would
not
do
for
him
to
come
after
us
,
for
the
Indians
would
shoot
him
from
this
side
.
<EOS>
”'“Why
would
dey
do
dem
things?”“Because
<EOS>
it
is
the
nature
of
Indians
to
revenge
themselves
that
way
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
see
he
has
taken
their
canoe
,
and
I
should
n't
wonder
if
he
killed
one
or
two
of
their
warriors
before
he
was
able
to
get
off
with
it
.
<EOS>
That
shot
which
we
heard
was
probably
fired
at
him
.
<EOS>
”But
<EOS>
in
this
instance
the
ears
of
the
German
proved
more
correct
than
those
of
the
American
.
<EOS>
He
had
noticed
that
the
gun
was
discharged
from
the
river
,
establishing
the
fact
that
it
was
fired
by
Deerfoot
,
though
Jack
Carleton
could
not
understand
the
reason
why
it
was
done
.
<EOS>
It
was
manifest
that
the
Shawanoe
meant
to
cross
to
the
other
side
the
Mississippi
,
in
order
to
throw
the
Miamis
“
off
the
trail
”
—
that
is
,
he
would
keep
out
of
their
sight
until
be
gained
a
chance
to
return
for
his
friends
.
<EOS>
It
occurred
at
once
to
the
young
Kentuckian
that
such
being
the
case
,
the
situation
of
himself
and
Otto
was
one
of
considerable
danger
.
<EOS>
The
high
-
handed
course
of
the
Shawanoe
would
rouse
the
enmity
of
the
Miamis
to
the
highest
point
.
<EOS>
Revenge
is
one
of
the
most
marked
characteristics
of
the
American
Indian
,
who
is
eager
to
retaliate
upon
the
innocent
when
he
can
not
reach
the
guilty
.
<EOS>
The
three
who
had
suffered
the
indignity
could
easily
follow
the
trail
of
the
boys
,
wheresoever
it
might
lead
,
excepting
through
water
.
<EOS>
What
,
therefore
,
was
more
likely
than
that
they
would
seek
to
adjust
matters
by
slaying
those
who
had
taken
no
hand
in
the
capture
of
the
canoe?Jack
knew
that
there
were
only
three
Miamis
directly
concerned
,
but
Deerfoot
had
spoken
of
others
in
the
neighborhood
,
beside
which
the
young
Kentuckian
himself
had
seen
a
couple
of
Shawanoes
,
only
a
few
hours
before
,
at
no
great
distance
from
that
very
spot
.
<EOS>
When
he
made
known
his
fears
to
Otto
,
the
latter
agreed
they
were
in
great
peril
,
and
the
utmost
care
was
necessary
to
keep
clear
of
the
red
men
.
<EOS>
The
precise
course
best
to
adopt
was
hard
to
determine
,
but
they
began
a
guarded
departure
from
the
spot
,
stepping
as
carefully
and
lightly
as
possible
.
<EOS>
Though
Otto
Relstaub
,
like
his
,
parents
,
had
never
been
able
to
handle
the
English
language
intelligently
,
and
though
he
was
afflicted
with
a
forgetfulness
all
too
common
with
most
boys
of
his
age
,
yet
his
life
on
the
frontier
had
not
been
without
its
lessons
to
him
.
<EOS>
At
times
he
showed
a
shrewdness
and
knowledge
of
woodcraft
which
surprised
Jack
Carleton
,
who
often
became
impatient
with
his
shortsightedness
.
<EOS>
The
manner
in
which
he
seconded
the
efforts
of
his
companion
to
mislead
the
Indians
,
known
to
be
close
at
hand
,
certainly
was
deserving
of
high
praise
.
<EOS>
The
friends
advanced
some
twenty
rods
or
more
,
Otto
keeping
close
behind
Jack
,
without
seeing
or
hearing
anything
of
their
enemies
.
<EOS>
Looking
across
the
Mississippi
,
nothing
was
observed
of
Deerfoot
or
his
canoe
,
so
that
no
help
was
to
be
expected
for
many
hours
from
him
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
Jack
was
confident
that
nothing
of
the
kind
could
be
done
before
night
,
when
the
matchless
Shawanoe
would
have
the
darkness
to
help
him
.
<EOS>
To
the
young
Kentuckian
,
the
advent
of
Deerfoot
was
of
that
nature
that
he
failed
to
see
that
it
had
accomplished
any
good
.
<EOS>
If
he
and
Otto
could
gain
a
suitable
start
,
they
would
swim
across
.
<EOS>
“Sh
!
”
whispered
the
German
,
reaching
forward
and
catching
the
arm
of
his
friend
;
“
waits
one
,
two
,
dree
smond
.
<EOS>
”“What
<EOS>
is
the
matter
?
”
<EOS>
asked
the
alarmed
Jack
,
as
he
turned
hastily
about
.
<EOS>
“Let
you
go
dot
way
<EOS>
and
me
go
<EOS>
dot
way
,
and
<EOS>
it
leetle
ways
off
<EOS>
we
comes
togedder
agin
once
inore
.
<EOS>
”Rather
<EOS>
curiously
,
the
leader
was
asking
himself
at
that
moment
whether
something
could
not
be
gained
by
him
and
Otto
separating
and
afterward
meeting
at
some
point
further
up
stream
.
<EOS>
Such
,
as
is
well
known
,
is
the
practice
of
the
Apaches
when
hotly
pursued
to
their
mountain
fastnesses
.
<EOS>
A
large
company
will
dissolve
into
its
“
original
elements
,
”
as
may
be
said
,
rendering
pursuit
out
of
the
question
.
<EOS>
The
wisdom
of
this
course
on
the
part
of
Jack
and
Otto
might
well
be
questioned
,
but
,
without
giving
the
matter
any
thought
,
the
young
Kentuckian
acted
upon
the
suggestion
.
<EOS>
“You
keep
close
to
the
river
,
”
he
said
,
“
while
I
turn
to
the
right
,
and
will
come
back
to
the
shore
a
few
hundred
yards
above
.
<EOS>
We
'll
use
our
old
signal
if
we
have
anything
to
say
to
each
other
.
<EOS>
”Otto
nodded
his
bead
to
signify
that
he
understood
the
arrangement
,
and
,
without
another
word
,
the
two
diverged
,
speedily
losing
sight
of
each
other
in
the
wood
,
which
showed
more
under
growth
than
that
through
which
they
passed
the
day
before
.
<EOS>
“I
declare
,
”
said
Jack
to
himself
,
before
he
had
gone
far
,
“
I
much
misgive
myself
whether
this
is
going
to
help
matters
;
it
must
be
a
good
deal
easier
for
the
Indians
to
pick
up
one
of
us
at
a
time
,
than
it
is
to
take
the
two
together
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
best
after
all
,
”
he
added
a
minute
later
,
with
the
natural
hopefulness
of
his
nature
,
“
for
I
learned
long
ago
that
if
two
or
three
hunters
separate
while
in
the
Indian
country
,
they
can
take
better
care
of
themselves
than
if
they
stay
together
.
<EOS>
”He
stood
still
and
looked
and
listened
.
<EOS>
The
wood
,
as
has
been
said
,
was
denser
than
that
to
which
he
had
been
accustomed
,
and
,
when
he
used
his
eyes
to
the
utmost
,
he
saw
nothing
to
cause
alarm
.
<EOS>
The
lynx
-
eyed
Miamis
could
follow
his
trail
with
little
trouble
,
no
matter
how
much
be
sought
to
conceal
it
,
and
the
fact
that
he
saw
and
heard
nothing
could
be
no
proof
that
danger
itself
was
not
near
.
<EOS>
“I
<EOS>
am
sure
those
were
Shawanoes
that
I
saw
yesterday
,
”
he
muttered
,
“
and
yet
Deerfoot
insists
they
were
Miamis
who
broke
up
his
canoe
.
<EOS>
Wonder
whether
there
's
a
war
party
of
both—”The
bright
eyes
of
the
youth
at
that
very
moment
told
him
a
singular
fact
:
only
a
short
distance
in
front
of
him
stood
two
red
men
in
their
war
paint
.
<EOS>
They
were
talking
together
and
had
their
backs
toward
him
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
they
were
so
motionless
,
that
he
had
failed
to
see
them
in
the
first
place
,
and
would
have
failed
again
but
for
the
low
,
guttural
murmur
of
their
voices
.
<EOS>
Jack
instantly
stepped
behind
the
large
trunk
of
a
tree
and
peered
out
with
an
interest
that
may
well
be
understood
.
<EOS>
It
was
curious
that
the
youth
should
have
approached
so
close
without
detection
,
but
it
was
complimentary
to
his
woodcraft
that
such
was
the
fact
.
<EOS>
Whatever
the
subject
of
conversation
between
the
Indians
,
they
speedily
became
absorbed
in
it
,
their
arms
sawed
the
air
,
and
their
voices
rose
to
it
pitch
that
carried
the
sound
far
beyond
where
he
stood
.
<EOS>
Their
interest
in
the
discussion
frequently
brought
the
profile
of
the
further
one
into
view
and
showed
so
much
of
his
front
,
that
his
tribal
character
was
settled
beyond
question
;
he
was
a
Shawanoe
,
one
of
the
dreaded
people
who
did
more
than
any
other
to
earn
the
name
of
Dark
and
Bloody
Ground
for
one
section
of
the
Union
.
<EOS>
It
was
established
,
therefore
,
that
there
were
two
distinct
parties
in
that
particular
section
.
<EOS>
The
Miamis
and
Shawanoes
were
natural
allies
,
and
there
could
be
no
question
that
a
perfect
understanding
existed
between
those
who
gave
our
friends
so
much
concern
.
<EOS>
Jack
Carleton
was
debating
with
himself
whether
it
would
be
a
safe
undertaking
for
him
to
withdraw
,
and
,
venturing
further
into
the
woods
,
seek
to
flank
the
warriors
who
had
risen
so
unexpectedly
in
his
path
.
<EOS>
He
had
already
been
so
delayed
that
his
agreement
with
Otto
was
likely
to
be
disarranged
,
and
it
would
not
do
to
stay
too
long
where
he
had
halted
.
<EOS>
Before
a
conclusion
was
formed
,
the
interview
between
the
couple
ended
.
<EOS>
They
abruptly
ceased
talking
,
and
one
started
north
and
the
other
south
.
<EOS>
As
they
did
so
Jack
learned
another
significant
fact
—
they
belonged
to
different
tribes
.
<EOS>
The
one
who
went
northward
looked
squarely
in
the
face
of
his
friend
,
just
before
moving
out
,
and
,
in
doing
so
,
gave
the
best
view
of
his
countenance
that
the
boy
had
yet
obtained
.
<EOS>
That
view
revealed
him
as
a
Miami
beyond
all
question
.
<EOS>
The
other
wheeled
about
and
advanced
almost
in
a
direct
line
toward
Jack
,
who
felt
that
his
situation
was
becoming
very
delicate
and
peculiar
.
<EOS>
There
could
be
no
mistaking
the
tribe
of
that
warrior
,
who
was
a
splendid
'
specimen
of
physical
vigor
and
manhood
.
<EOS>
Jack
suspected
that
he
was
not
only
a
Shawanoe
,
but
was
a
chief
or
leader
.
<EOS>
The
hideous
paint
which
was
smeared
over
his
repulsive
face
,
was
more
elaborate
than
in
the
case
of
the
two
from
whom
the
youth
effected
such
a
narrow
escape
.
<EOS>
That
which
Jack
saw
confirmed
his
belief
of
a
perfect
understanding
between
the
different
parties
.
<EOS>
They
probably
numbered
a
dozen
altogether
,
and
had
determined
to
bring
the
friendly
Indian
and
two
white
men
to
account
for
the
outrage
of
the
young
Shawanoe
—
for
,
brief
as
was
the
time
mince
it
had
been
perpetrated
,
it
was
more
than
probable
that
it
was
known
to
all
.
<EOS>
“I
<EOS>
wish
that
heathen
would
take
it
into
his
head
to
move
some
other
way
,
”
thought
Jack
to
himself
,
as
he
drew
his
head
back
,
fearful
of
being
seen
.
<EOS>
“
If
he
comes
straight
on
,
he
'll
bump
his
forehead
against
this
tree
,
and
,
if
he
turns
out
,
he
will
pass
so
close
to
the
trunk
that
I
've
got
to
be
lively
if
he
does
n't
run
against
me
.
”Listening
<EOS>
intently
,
he
was
able
to
hear
the
soft
footfall
of
the
warrior
upon
the
leaves
,
scarcely
louder
than
the
faint
tipping
of
the
claw
of
a
small
bird
.
<EOS>
Had
the
Shawanoe
suspected
there
was
the
slightest
need
for
care
,
his
tread
would
have
been
silent
.
<EOS>
A
few
seconds
passed
when
the
delicate
sound
ceased
.
<EOS>
What
could
it
mean
?
<EOS>
Did
the
Indian
suspect
the
truth
?
<EOS>
Was
he
standing
motionless
,
or
was
he
advancing
with
that
noiseless
step
which
the
ear
of
the
listening
Indian
himself
fails
to
note?These
were
the
questions
which
the
young
Kentuckian
asked
,
and
which
for
the
time
be
could
not
answer
.
<EOS>
He
shrank
close
to
the
bark
of
the
tree
,
with
his
gun
clasped
and
the
hammer
raised
ready
to
fire
at
an
instant
's
notice
.
<EOS>
Knowing
<EOS>
so
well
the
subtlety
of
the
red
men
<EOS>
,
it
occurred
to
Jack
that
his
foe
perhaps
was
stealthily
flanking
him
.
<EOS>
He
was
moving
to
one
side
and
the
moment
he
could
gain
a
shot
he
would
fire
.
<EOS>
The
suspense
became
more
trying
than
disaster
itself
could
be
,
and
Jack
determined
to
end
it
by
learning
the
precise
situation
of
the
Shawanoe
,
and
what
he
was
likely
to
attempt
to
do
in
the
way
of
hostilities
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
IX
.
<EOS>
A
TIMELY
ARRIVALOne
of
the
most
convincing
evidences
of
a
Power
beyond
our
comprehension
,
governing
and
directing
everything
for
the
best
,
is
the
marvelous
degree
to
which
the
different
faculties
of
our
nature
can
be
trained
.
<EOS>
There
is
a
skill
which
can
not
be
explained
or
understood
by
him
who
attains
it
;
and
,
interwoven
through
the
five
senses
which
science
assigns
to
us
,
seems
to
be
a
sixth
not
yet
understood
,
of
whose
wonderful
functions
every
one
of
us
has
seen
proof
.
<EOS>
The
Shawanoe
warrior
,
after
parting
with
his
companion
,
walked
leisurely
toward
the
tree
behind
which
the
young
Kentuckian
was
hiding
,
until
about
twenty
yards
separated
them
.
<EOS>
Then
he
stopped
as
abruptly
as
if
stricken
by
a
thunderbolt
.
<EOS>
There
was
“
something
in
the
air
”
which
whispered
danger
.
<EOS>
The
Indian
had
neither
seen
nor
heard
anything
to
cause
this
misgiving
,
but
he
knew
that
peril
confronted
him
.
<EOS>
What
he
would
have
done
in
the
event
of
Jack
Carleton
remaining
silent
and
stationary
behind
the
trunk
can
only
be
conjectured
;
but
the
impatience
of
the
youth
ended
that
phase
of
the
situation
.
<EOS>
Softly
removing
his
cap
,
the
young
Kentuckian
slowly
moved
the
side
of
his
head
to
the
right
.
<EOS>
In
doing
so
,
he
kept
his
face
in
a
perpendicular
position
,
so
that
the
least
possible
part
of
his
head
was
exposed
.
<EOS>
Had
he
inclined
it
,
the
upper
portion
would
have
shown
before
the
eye
could
have
been
brought
into
use
.
<EOS>
The
first
object
on
which
Jack
's
vision
rested
was
the
Shawanoe
warrior
,
standing
erect
,
one
foot
slightly
advanced
and
both
hands
grasping
the
rifle
in
front
of
him
.
<EOS>
The
face
was
daubed
and
streaked
with
paint
,
and
the
gleaming
black
eyes
were
looking
straight
at
the
startled
youth
.
<EOS>
Like
a
flash
the
dusky
arms
brought
the
gun
to
his
shoulder
,
and
it
is
safe
to
say
that
Jack
Carleton
never
in
all
his
life
drew
back
his
head
with
such
celerity
.
<EOS>
Quick
as
was
the
Indian
,
he
was
not
quick
enough
to
catch
the
lad
,
who
,
it
will
be
seen
,
had
very
little
to
do
in
order
to
save
himself
for
the
moment
.
<EOS>
With
a
faint
whoop
,
the
redskin
bounded
behind
the
nearest
tree
,
and
,
with
his
cocked
rifle
at
command
,
awaited
an
opening
that
would
allow
him
to
slay
his
foe
.
<EOS>
Thus
the
two
occupied
precisely
the
same
,
relative
position
;
each
was
protected
by
a
trunk
of
a
tree
large
enough
to
shield
his
body
,
and
each
grasped
a
loaded
and
cocked
rifle
,
eager
to
use
it
the
instant
the
opportunity
presented
itself
.
<EOS>
Who
was
to
win
in
this
curious
contest
?
<EOS>
Looking
at
the
situation
dispassionately
,
it
must
be
admitted
that
the
chances
favored
the
Indian
.
<EOS>
He
was
older
,
stronger
,
more
active
,
and
possessed
greater
cunning
than
did
the
youth
.
<EOS>
What
,
after
all
,
is
one
of
the
most
important
factors
in
such
a
problem
,
the
American
race
possess
by
training
,
and
nature
—
patience
scarcely
second
to
that
of
the
Esquimau
.
<EOS>
The
probabilities
were
that
the
Shawanoe
would
wait
until
the
youth
was
led
into
some
fatal
indiscretion
.
<EOS>
All
this
,
be
it
remembered
,
is
based
on
the
condition
that
no
such
thing
as
“
foreign
interference
”
took
place
.
<EOS>
Is
there
any
reader
of
mine
who
has
not
been
entertained
in
his
early
youth
by
the
story
of
the
white
man
and
the
Indian
,
who
,
being
placed
in
the
situation
of
Jack
and
the
Shawanoe
,
remained
in
hiding
from
each
other
,
until
the
Caucasian
drew
the
shot
of
the
American
,
by
placing
his
cap
on
the
end
of
the
ramrod
or
gun
and
projecting
it
far
enough
from
behind
the
tree
,
thus
leading
the
Indian
to
believe
that
the
head
of
his
foe
was
in
range
?
<EOS>
If
such
an
incident
ever
took
place
,
the
warrior
must
have
been
unusually
stupid
to
leap
from
cover
,
as
the
story
makes
him
do
,
until
certain
he
had
brought
the
other
down
.
<EOS>
Jack
Carleton
attempted
the
same
artifice
,
except
that
,
instead
of
taking
the
trouble
to
draw
his
ramrod
or
using
his
rifle
for
that
purpose
,
he
held
his
cap
in
hand
,
shoving
it
forward
very
slowly
and
with
great
care
,
The
trick
failed
.
<EOS>
The
Shawanoe
must
have
suspected
the
truth
on
the
first
appearance
of
the
head
-
gear
.
<EOS>
Jack
pushed
it
forward
until
sure
it
was
seen
,
but
no
demonstration
came
from
the
warrior
,
who
,
for
aught
the
youth
knew
,
was
essaying
the
same
deception
.
<EOS>
Determined
to
learn
something
about
his
enemy
,
Jack
threw
his
head
to
one
side
and
drew
it
back
again
before
the
warrior
could
pull
the
trigger
.
<EOS>
He
knew
precisely
where
to
look
,
but
he
was
unable
to
catch
sight
of
the
Shawanoe
or
his
weapon
.
<EOS>
“I
wonder
whether
he
has
shifted
his
quarters
,
”
said
Jack
to
himself
.
<EOS>
“
If
he
has
,
he
will
shot
at
me
before
I
can
learn
where
he
is
.
<EOS>
Holloa!”The
second
time
he
thrust
forward
his
face
withdrawing
it
with
the
same
celerity
as
before
,
he
caught
a
passing
glimpse
of
the
Shawanoe
,
who
,
rather
curiously
,
adopted
exactly
the
same
artifice
.
<EOS>
This
“
located
”
the
savage
and
relieved
Jack
,
for
the
moment
,
of
his
terrifying
dread
that
death
threatened
from
an
unknown
point
.
<EOS>
But
,
within
the
next
minute
,
the
redskin
utterance
to
a
faint
whoop
,
clearly
meant
as
a
signal
to
a
comrade
not
far
off
.
<EOS>
“He
is
calling
back
the
Miami
,
who
left
him
a
few
minutes
ago
,
”
was
the
conclusion
of
Jack
.
<EOS>
“
It
'll
go
rough
with
me
if
I
have
two
of
them
to
fight
.
<EOS>
I
'll
try
a
little
of
the
signaling
myself
.
<EOS>
”Placing
<EOS>
the
thumb
and
forefinger
of
his
left
hand
against
his
tongue
,
he
emitted
a
low
,
tremulous
whistle
,
such
as
he
and
Otto
used
when
on
hunting
expeditions
together
.
<EOS>
He
repeated
it
,
and
then
,
greatly
to
his
relief
,
received
a
reply
,
though
it
was
so
guarded
that
he
could
not
guess
<EOS>
the
point
whence
it
came
.
<EOS>
“Now
,
if
Otto
proves
sharp
enough
to
grasp
the
situation
,
without
running
into
ambush
,
we
may
settle
the
matter
with
this
fellow
before
the
other
can
take
a
hand—”As
on
the
previous
day
,
something
twinkled
among
the
trees
to
the
left
.
<EOS>
A
glance
in
that
direction
and
Jack
saw
,
with
dismay
,
that
the
Miami
warrior
had
arrived
.
<EOS>
The
worst
of
it
,
too
,
was
that
he
appeared
so
far
over
from
where
the
Shawanoe
stood
that
lines
connecting
the
three
would
have
made
almost
a
right
angle
.
<EOS>
It
looked
as
if
the
youth
must
be
exposed
to
the
enfilading
fire
of
one
of
his
enemies
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
frightful
situation
,
but
the
brave
Kentuckian
did
not
lose
heart
.
<EOS>
He
pressed
against
the
bark
as
closely
as
he
could
,
endeavoring
to
watch
both
points
,
but
he
was
fearfully
handicapped
,
and
there
was
little
hope
for
him
,
unless
his
friend
could
interfere
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
the
Miami
,
who
,
naturally
enough
,
had
taken
to
the
shelter
of
a
tree
,
after
the
manner
of
his
comrade
,
made
a
bound
of
several
feet
which
placed
him
behind
a
second
trunk
that
was
still
further
to
the
rear
of
Jack
Carleton
.
<EOS>
Another
such
leap
and
the
youth
would
be
effectually
uncovered
.
<EOS>
But
the
anxiously
prayed
for
deliverance
came
at
this
critical
moment
.
<EOS>
While
the
Miami
was
maneuvering
for
position
,
Otto
Relstaub
appeared
behind
him
,
and
,
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
,
the
merciless
warrior
was
placed
between
two
fires
.
<EOS>
“You
<EOS>
let
dot
chap
alone
?
”
<EOS>
called
out
the
German
,
with
his
gun
to
his
shoulder
,
“
or
py
gracious
I
'll
shoot
my
ramrod
clean
through
you
as
nefer
vos
<EOS>
I
do
n't
it?”The
<EOS>
unexpected
discovery
of
his
mortal
peril
threw
the
Miami
into
a
panic
.
<EOS>
It
was
impossible
for
him
to
find
shelter
at
the
same
moment
from
both
his
enemies
,
for
,
on
whatever
side
of
the
tree
he
took
refuge
,
he
would
be
in
range
of
one
of
them
.
<EOS>
With
a
howl
of
consternation
,
he
whirled
on
his
heel
and
ran
like
a
frightened
deer
.
<EOS>
As
he
did
so
,
he
ducked
his
head
and
leaped
from
side
to
side
,
after
the
manner
of
the
Digger
Indians
of
the
present
day
,
with
a
view
of
distracting
the
fire
of
his
enemies
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
been
a
feat
of
marksmanship
had
either
lad
brought
him
down
,
when
so
many
and
varying
objects
intervened
,
and
neither
of
the
youths
made
the
attempt
.
<EOS>
When
the
terrified
fugitive
vanished
,
he
was
without
a
wound
or
scratch
to
tell
of
the
danger
from
which
he
had
fled
.
<EOS>
During
these
stirring
moments
,
the
Shawanoe
had
taken
no
part
and
given
no
sign
of
interest
in
what
was
going
on
;
but
Jack
,
who
was
fully
aroused
by
the
venomous
attempt
on
his
life
,
called
to
his
friend
,
whose
position
he
knew
commanded
that
of
the
savage:“Otto
,
shoot
the
wretch!”“Dot
<EOS>
is
vot
<EOS>
I
vos
going
to
do
,
”
was
the
reply
of
the
German
,
who
took
careful
aim
around
the
side
of
the
tree
.
<EOS>
He
was
in
plain
view
of
Jack
,
who
watched
him
with
a
rapidly
beating
heart
,
knowing
as
he
did
that
the
fellow
carried
an
excellent
gun
and
was
it
good
shot
.
<EOS>
But
,
while
glancing
along
the
rifle
-
barrel
,
with
one
eye
closed
,
Otto
raised
his
head
,
opened
both
eyes
and
looked
toward
the
point
at
which
he
had
been
aiming
.
<EOS>
Then
his
cheery
laughter
rang
out
.
<EOS>
“What
is
the
matter
?
”
<EOS>
asked
the
astonished
Jack
.
<EOS>
“Now
<EOS>
,
ai
n't
dot
funny
?
<EOS>
He
Indian
ai
n't
dere!”“Yes
,
he
is
,
”
shouted
Jack
,
suspecting
trickery
.
<EOS>
“
He
will
shoot
you
,
if
you
do
n't
bring
him
down!”Otto
glanced
affrightedly
behind
him
,
as
though
he
heard
a
stealthy
footstep
,
but
called
back
once
more
that
the
Shawanoe
had
disappeared
.
<EOS>
It
occurred
to
the
other
youth
,
just
then
,
that
if
the
warrior
was
in
the
vicinity
and
could
be
seen
by
Otto
,
he
must
be
visible
to
him
.
<EOS>
But
a
sweeping
survey
of
the
field
failed
to
bring
to
light
the
painted
face
and
feathered
crown
.
<EOS>
There
could
be
no
doubt
that
the
Shawanoe
had
taken
advantage
of
the
diversion
caused
by
Otto
's
arrival
,
and
had
not
stood
on
the
order
of
his
going
.
<EOS>
Five
minutes
before
,
there
seemed
no
chance
of
Jack
Carleton
preserving
his
life
.
<EOS>
Now
,
how
changed
!
<EOS>
Toward
whatever
point
of
the
compass
he
looked
,
he
saw
not
the
first
evidence
that
peril
threatened
.
<EOS>
But
for
all
that
,
it
was
uncomfortably
nigh
,
and
it
was
difficult
to
find
a
place
in
which
there
was
less
safety
than
where
they
were
.
<EOS>
Jack
resolved
to
leave
at
once
.
<EOS>
At
the
moment
he
stepped
from
behind
the
tree
which
had
sheltered
him
,
Otto
strode
toward
him
,
his
broad
face
still
broader
on
account
of
his
beaming
pleasure
.
<EOS>
“Dot
vos
me
,
”
he
said
,
triumphantly
.
<EOS>
“
Otto
doned
it
.
<EOS>
”“Did
<EOS>
what?”“Scared
'
ern
<EOS>
so
dot
they
forgits
him
nefer
.
<EOS>
”“You
did
well
,
beyond
question
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
see
how
I
would
have
saved
myself
if
you
had
n't
come
as
you
did
.
<EOS>
I
shall
never
forget
it
,
Otto
,
though
I
think
it
was
a
mistake
when
we
parted
company
it
short
while
ago
.
<EOS>
It
looks
as
though
these
Miamis
and
Shawanoes
are
on
all
sides
of
us
,
and
we
must
find
some
kind
of
shelter
or
make
a
hasty
change
of
base
.
<EOS>
”“Dot
's
vot
<EOS>
I
dinks
,
”
assented
the
other
.
<EOS>
“
I
am
waiting
for
you
to
show
me
vot
's
I
does
n't
do
.
”“It
<EOS>
is
hard
to
tell
what
is
the
best
course
,
”
said
Jack
,
who
,
while
talking
,
was
moving
slowly
toward
the
Mississippi
,
watching
,
meanwhile
,
every
point
of
the
compass
.
<EOS>
“
But
,
somehow
or
other
I
feel
there
's
less
danger
by
the
river
than
anywhere
else
.
<EOS>
”“I
<EOS>
likes
it
dere
better
than
other
places
,
for
if
we
finds
the
Indians
are
going
to
boder
us
,
we
can
cheat
'em
as
easy
as
nefer
vos
.
<EOS>
”“How?”“We
can
jump
in
the
river
and
drowns
mit
,
ourselves
;
wo
n't
dey
be
<EOS>
fooled!”“Perhaps
they
would
be
disappointed
;
but
I
do
n't
see
where
we
are
likely
to
gain
anything
.
<EOS>
”“I
does
n't
see
hims
mineself
,
”
grinned
Otto
,
whose
whims
led
him
to
be
amusing
during
the
most
trying
moments
,
as
well
as
grave
when
others
were
light
-
hearted
.
<EOS>
“I
<EOS>
only
wish
we
were
on
the
other
side
,
”
said
the
young
Kentuckian
,
who
at
that
moment
caught
the
gleam
of
the
Mississippi
through
the
trees
in
front
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
X.
AT
BAYWhile
Jack
and
Otto
were
talking
in
guarded
tones
,
and
carefully
picking
their
way
through
the
wood
,
each
stopped
and
became
silent
at
the
same
instant
.
<EOS>
They
saw
nothing
,
but
their
ears
told
them
some
person
or
animal
was
approaching
through
the
undergrowth
behind
them
.
<EOS>
Within
the
same
minute
the
creature
revealed
himself
in
the
form
of
a
large
,
black
bear
,
which
was
lumbering
along
unmindful
that
enemies
were
near
.
<EOS>
“Mebbe
<EOS>
he
do
n't
be
an
Indian
,
”
whispered
Otto
,
who
knew
much
of
the
cunning
of
the
red
men
.
<EOS>
The
same
thought
had
occurred
to
the
Kentuckian
,
who
held
his
gun
at
full
cock
,
until
he
should
be
able
to
learn
the
truth
.
<EOS>
While
thus
employed
be
could
not
help
reflecting
on
the
improbability
of
such
a
clumsy
artifice
being
that
time
,
for
there
was
no
call
for
the
attempt
,
no
prospect
of
deceiving
two
persons
who
displayed
such
excellent
woodcraft
.
<EOS>
Jack
speedily
saw
that
the
bear
was
a
genuine
one
,
probably
on
his
way
to
the
river
.
<EOS>
There
no
occasion
for
shooting
him
,
and
the
hunters
stepped
aside
to
allow
him
to
pass
.
<EOS>
Jack
kept
eye
on
him
,
however
,
for
it
being
the
spring
of
year
,
he
had
not
been
long
out
of
his
hibernating
quarters
,
and
was
likely
to
be
lean
,
hungry
,
fierce
.
<EOS>
Bruin
caught
sight
of
the
hunters
,
while
several
rods
off
,
and
throwing
up
his
snout
,
took
a
look
at
them
,
as
though
uncertain
of
the
species
to
which
they
belonged
.
<EOS>
“He
<EOS>
looks
pig
,
do
n't
he
?
”
<EOS>
said
Otto
,
referring
to
his
size
,
and
half
inclined
to
give
him
a
shot
.
<EOS>
“
One
pullet
would
make
him
put
up
dot
snout
down
.
<EOS>
”“Let
him
alone
,
so
long
as
he
does
n't
disturb
us
.
<EOS>
He
is
n't
half
so
dangerous
as
the
Indians
and
they
would
be
likely
to
rush
upon
us
before
you
could
reload
your
gun
.
<EOS>
”Otto
<EOS>
saw
the
prudence
of
his
friend
's
words
,
and
he
not
only
let
down
the
hammer
of
his
rifle
,
but
emphasized
his
intention
by
turning
his
back
upon
the
bear
.
<EOS>
The
huge
beast
seemed
disposed
to
attack
the
boys
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
that
the
plump
,
ruddy
-
faced
Gorman
looked
specially
tempting
to
him
while
in
his
hungry
state
,
for
Jack
fancied
that
it
was
he
on
whom
his
large
eyes
were
fixed
with
a
peculiar
lodging
.
<EOS>
The
bear
took
several
steps
toward
the
couple
,
and
Jack
cocked
his
gun
,
believing
he
would
have
to
fire
.
<EOS>
Otto
,
seeing
the
movement
,
turned
,
but
at
that
moment
the
animal
,
if
he
had
actually
any
purpose
of
opening
hostilities
,
changed
his
mind
,
moving
off
to
one
side
,
and
continued
his
awkward
gait
toward
the
river
.
<EOS>
The
boys
watched
him
until
be
reached
the
stream
and
began
lapping
the
water
,
when
they
resumed
their
withdrawal
from
the
spot
,
still
walking
in
a
northerly
course
along
the
right
bank
of
the
Mississippi
.
<EOS>
Both
were
anxious
to
get
as
far
away
as
they
could
,
in
the
hope
that
they
would
be
able
to
keep
a
safe
space
between
themselves
and
the
red
men
,
whom
they
held
in
such
fear
.
<EOS>
Their
uneasiness
was
not
lessened
when
the
sharp
crack
of
a
rifle
broke
upon
their
ears
,
from
a
point
not
far
down
the
stream
.
<EOS>
It
was
followed
by
another
report
deeper
in
the
woods
,
and
then
several
whoops
came
from
different
parts
of
the
forest
,
all
being
within
a
short
radius
.
<EOS>
The
boys
could
not
guess
the
cause
of
the
firing
,
unless
they
were
meant
as
signals
,
but
they
were
sure
the
cries
referred
to
them
.
<EOS>
Most
likely
,
as
they
viewed
it
,
they
were
meant
to
direct
the
actions
of
the
parties
,
who
must
have
felt
that
it
only
needed
a
little
care
and
energy
to
capture
the
youths
that
,
up
to
that
time
,
had
baffled
the
enmity
of
both
the
Miamis
and
Shawanoes
.
<EOS>
The
result
was
,
that
Jack
and
Otto
,
keeping
as
near
as
was
prudent
to
the
river
,
pushed
on
as
fast
as
they
could
.
<EOS>
A
species
of
running
vine
close
to
the
ground
caused
them
much
annoyance
,
the
more
chubby
one
falling
forward
several
times
on
his
hands
and
knees
.
<EOS>
They
had
traveled
a
short
distance
only
,
when
the
signals
that
had
so
alarmed
them
were
heard
again
.
<EOS>
The
Indiana
called
to
each
other
by
means
of
the
whoops
and
shouts
,
as
intelligible
to
those
for
whom
they
were
meant
as
if
they
were
so
many
spoken
words
.
<EOS>
The
lads
could
not
fail
to
observe
that
they
were
considerably
nearer
than
before
.
<EOS>
The
red
men
were
evidently
converging
in
their
pursuit
,
and
meant
to
force
the
struggle
to
an
issue
with
the
least
delay
possible
.
<EOS>
“We
must
travel
faster
,
”
said
Jack
Carleton
,
compressing
his
lips
,
after
glancing
behind
him
.
<EOS>
“
This
has
settled
down
to
a
regular
race
between
us
.
<EOS>
”“Dot
is
so
,
”
assented
Otto
,
sprawling
forward
again
on
his
hands
and
knees
,
from
the
running
vine
which
caught
,
like
fine
wire
,
around
his
ankles
.
<EOS>
“
If
it
Vos
who
falls
down
the
most
and
cracks
his
head
,
den
I
would
beat
dem
,
do
n't
it?”“We
shall
have
to
make
a
fight
for
they
can
travel
a
great
deal
faster
than
we—”“Let
's
jump
mit
<EOS>
the
river
;
we
gets
so
far
off
afore
<EOS>
dey
<EOS>
learns
vot
<EOS>
we
do
n't
do
.
<EOS>
”It
<EOS>
seemed
to
be
the
only
recourse
left
to
the
fugitives
,
and
they
turned
toward
the
Mississippi
.
<EOS>
But
at
that
very
moment
Jack
caught
sight
of
a
pile
of
logs
only
a
short
distance
ahead
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
a
direct
interference
of
Providence
,
totally
unexpected
by
both
.
<EOS>
Whether
the
logs
were
the
retreat
of
a
friend
or
enemy
could
only
be
guessed
.
<EOS>
The
probabilities
were
that
the
former
was
the
case
,
since
the
structure
was
not
of
the
kind
made
by
Indians
.
<EOS>
Jack
caught
the
arm
of
Otto
and
whirled
him
back
.
<EOS>
“Vot
ai
n't
de
matter
?
”
<EOS>
asked
the
German
,
half
angrily
at
the
check
,
when
there
was
so
much
necessity
for
haste
.
<EOS>
“See
?
”
<EOS>
asked
Jack
,
in
turn
,
pointing
to
the
logs
as
seen
through
the
trees
.
<EOS>
Otto
nodded
his
head
.
<EOS>
It
was
enough
,
and
he
made
a
desperate
rush
to
reach
the
refuge
,
catching
his
foot
and
falling
headlong
again
.
<EOS>
“Dunderation
!
”
he
exclaimed
;
“
wonder
if
dere
ai
n't
no
blamed
vines
that
I
hef
not
fall
over
and
proke
mine
nose
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
whoops
of
the
Miamis
and
Shawanoes
sounded
still
closer
;
they
were
pressing
the
pursuit
with
utmost
vigor
,
and
were
upon
the
heels
of
the
fugitives
.
<EOS>
The
Kentuckian
,
who
continually
glanced
back
,
caught
sight
of
more
than
one
figure
flitting
among
the
trees
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
something
red
gleamed
;
it
was
the
flash
of
a
gun
,
and
,
at
the
same
moment
the
sharp
report
rang
out
,
the
bullet
passed
between
Jack
and
Otto
,
who
were
striving
desperately
to
get
beyond
reach
before
a
fair
aim
could
tempt
their
enemies
.
<EOS>
The
second
view
which
Jack
caught
of
the
shelter
told
him
it
was
simply
four
walls
of
logs
,
a
dozen
feet
square
,
half
as
high
,
and
without
any
roof
.
<EOS>
When
,
why
,
and
by
whom
they
had
been
put
up
was
a
mystery
.
<EOS>
But
no
oasis
in
the
flaming
desert
could
be
more
welcome
to
the
traveler
dying
with
thirst
<EOS>
than
was
this
simple
structure
to
the
panting
fugitives
.
<EOS>
Jack
Carleton
,
with
a
recklessness
caused
by
the
imminence
of
his
peril
,
flung
his
gun
over
into
the
enclosure
,
sprang
upward
so
as
to
grasp
the
topmost
log
,
and
scrambled
after
it
with
the
headlong
impetuosity
of
a
wounded
animal
.
<EOS>
Otto
was
only
a
second
or
two
behind
him
,
and
,
.puffing
and
gasping
,
he
dropped
squarely
on
his
head
and
shoulders
,
rolled
over
,
caught
up
his
gun
again
,
and
sprang
to
his
feet
.
<EOS>
“Dot
's
de
way
I
always
climb
down
stairs
,
”
he
exclaimed
,
raising
the
hammer
of
his
gun
and
holding
it
ready
to
fire
on
the
first
appearance
of
a
foe
.
<EOS>
“It
's
all
well
enough
,
if
you
ai
n't
hurt
,
but
look
out
for
the
red
men
;
they
're
right
on
us
.
<EOS>
”“Dot
's
vot
<EOS>
I
do
n't
dinks
,
”
replied
Otto
,
who
,
still
panting
from
his
exertion
,
seemed
to
have
recovered
his
coolness
;
“
if
dey
climbs
up
dot
vall
,
den
dey
run
agin
de
,
pall
of
mine
gun
and
one
of
dem
gets
hurt
,
and
it
ai
n't
de
pall
-
don't
<EOS>
it?”The
<EOS>
pursuers
were
so
close
to
the
fugitives
that
the
tramp
of
their
moccasins
was
heard
at
the
moment
the
boys
braced
themselves
for
the
shock
which
they
were
sure
would
come
within
the
next
few
seconds
.
<EOS>
The
sight
of
a
flying
foe
intensifies
the
courage
of
the
pursuer
,
and
it
may
have
been
that
the
Shawanoe
who
discharged
his
gun
at
the
lads
,
when
they
were
so
close
to
the
shelter
,
believed
he
had
wounded
one
at
least
,
and
that
a
vigorous
assault
could
not
fail
to
end
the
struggle
speedily
.
<EOS>
There
may
,
in
fact
,
have
been
a
dozen
causes
which
incited
him
to
a
bravery
and
personal
effort
greater
than
that
of
any
of
his
companions
.
<EOS>
“They'll
try
to
overwhelm
us
,
”
said
Jack
.
<EOS>
“
Hold
your
gun
ready
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
words
were
yet
in
his
mouth
,
when
a
peculiar
,
soft
scratching
,
which
was
ended
the
instant
it
began
,
told
that
one
of
the
warriors
had
inserted
the
toe
of
his
moccasin
in
a
crevice
of
the
logs
,
with
the
purpose
of
climbing
over
into
the
enclosure
.
<EOS>
“I'll
attend
to
him
if
there
's
only
one
,
”
added
Jack
,
naturally
fearful
of
throwing
away
a
shot
.
<EOS>
“I
<EOS>
dinks
<EOS>
I
'
tends
him
mit
<EOS>
myself—”Suddenly
<EOS>
the
painted
face
of
a
Shawanoe
Indian
rose
to
view
.
<EOS>
One
hand
had
grasped
the
top
log
,
and
he
was
drawing
himself
rapidly
upward
with
the
purpose
of
leaping
over
.
<EOS>
The
countenance
was
frightful
beyond
description
—
the
streaks
and
circles
in
red
,
yellow
,
and
black
,
from
amid
which
glared
the
black
eyes
,
with
an
expression
of
ferocity
like
that
of
a
Bengal
tiger
,
and
the
white
teeth
,
gleaming
between
the
parted
lips
,
drawn
far
back
at
the
corners
,
gave
a
hideous
fierceness
to
the
visage
that
would
have
appalled
a
brave
man
who
saw
it
for
the
first
time
.
<EOS>
“I
<EOS>
dinks
<EOS>
I
'
tends
him
mit
myself—”Just
as
Otto
Relstaub
reached
that
point
in
his
remark
,
he
pulled
the
trigger
of
his
rifle
.
<EOS>
A
rasping
howl
followed
,
and
the
horrible
face
vanished
a
speedily
as
if
the
owner
had
been
standing
on
a
trap
-
door
,
which
was
sprung
.
<EOS>
“Yaw
<EOS>
—
I
dinks
I
'
tends
mit
him
,
”
repeated
Otto
,
coolly
lowering
his
gun
and
looking
at
the
spot
where
the
head
and
shoulders
were
visible
an
instant
before
.
<EOS>
“Load
up
quick
!
”
<EOS>
said
Jack
,
who
held
his
cocked
rifle
in
hand
while
his
eye
glanced
hastily
along
the
upper
part
of
the
logs
,
“
do
n't
lose
a
second
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
thump
of
the
body
was
heard
as
the
Shawanoe
—
dead
before
he
could
fall
the
brief
space
—
struck
the
ground
on
the
outside
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
moment
a
second
warrior
(
a
Miami
that
time
)
,
drew
himself
upward
close
to
the
place
from
which
the
Shawanoe
had
dropped
.
<EOS>
He
rose
until
his
tufted
head
,
his
sloping
forehead
and
his
gleaming
eyes
appeared
just
above
the
horizon
of
the
enclosure
.
<EOS>
Staring
downward
,
he
looked
straight
into
the
muzzle
of
a
rifle
,
held
by
a
young
Kentuckian
,
who
had
just
become
aware
of
his
presence
.
<EOS>
Down
went
the
Indian
,
possibly
with
a
suspicion
that
his
bronzed
skull
was
also
perforated
,
as
he
fell
across
the
limp
body
beneath
him
;
but
Jack
Carleton
had
not
fired
,
not
because
the
opportunity
was
not
inviting
enough
nor
because
he
felt
the
least
scruple
about
shooting
one
of
the
savages
who
were
thirsting
for
his
life
,
but
he
was
afraid
to
discharge
his
piece
before
Otto
should
force
another
bullet
home
.
<EOS>
Repeating
and
percussion
rifles
were
unknown
at
that
day
,
and
it
took
much
valuable
time
to
reload
musket
or
gun
after
its
discharge
.
<EOS>
Knowing
this
,
the
infuriated
redskins
were
likely
to
make
a
rush
whenever
they
knew
that
the
weapons
within
the
enclosure
were
unloaded
.
<EOS>
Inasmuch
as
the
boys
possessed
no
other
firearms
,
it
will
be
seen
that
in
such
an
event
they
would
be
helpless
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
it
was
impossible
for
them
to
hold
out
if
their
assailants
determined
to
force
matters
.
<EOS>
They
had
but
to
leap
over
the
walls
,
as
could
be
easily
done
,
and
the
contest
would
be
decided
right
speedily
;
that
decision
must
inevitably
be
against
the
daring
defenders
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
XI
.
<EOS>
A
PRIMITIVE
<EOS>
FORTThe
sharp
repulse
of
the
Indians
delayed
rush
which
,
as
has
been
said
,
could
ended
only
in
the
discomfiture
of
the
defenders
.
<EOS>
The
occurrence
proved
that
the
first
warriors
to
scale
the
walls
were
certain
to
share
the
fate
of
him
who
had
already
made
the
attempt
.
<EOS>
With
such
knowledge
it
would
be
unnatural
to
expect
any
Shawanoe
or
Miami
to
throw
himself
into
the
breach
,
since
,
as
a
rule
,
men
are
not
anxious
to
sacrifice
themselves
for
others
.
<EOS>
The
brief
respite
thus
afforded
Jack
and
Otto
enabled
them
to
make
a
closer
survey
of
the
shelter
which
had
presented
itself
so
providentially
to
them
.
<EOS>
They
found
little
not
apparent
to
their
terrified
gaze
when
they
scrambled
within
.
<EOS>
There
were
the
four
walls
and
nothing
more
.
<EOS>
With
that
morbid
interest
in
trifling
things
which
often
manifests
itself
in
the
most
critical
moments
,
Otto
counted
the
logs
on
each
of
the
four
sides
.
<EOS>
“Dere
be
nine
dere
,
”
said
he
,
indicating
the
western
side
,
“
ten
dere
,
and
nine
and
ten
on
de
other
sides
.
<EOS>
”“That
must
be
right
,
”
remarked
Jack
,
“
<EOS>
for
I
make
them
the
same
.
<EOS>
”“Tis
funny
dat
<EOS>
we
bofe
counts
dem
at
de
same
tine
,
when
each
one
is
not
doing
it
togedder
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
only
entrance
to
the
enclosure
,
as
it
seems
proper
to
call
it
,
was
the
one
used
by
the
boys
.
<EOS>
Nothing
to
suggest
a
door
,
or
any
purpose
of
making
one
,
was
to
be
seen
on
any
side
of
the
walls
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
impossible
that
some
hunters
,
who
had
encamped
in
the
vicinity
,
had
started
the
structure
with
the
intention
of
roofing
it
over
,
and
of
providing
some
original
means
of
ingress
and
egress
which
was
not
apparent
to
the
little
garrison
.
<EOS>
Convinced
that
they
would
not
be
disturbed
for
some
time
to
come
,
Jack
hastily
searched
for
loopholes
,
with
which
it
would
seem
the
structure
ought
to
have
been
provided
,
but
nothing
of
the
kind
was
discovered
.
<EOS>
Whoever
had
hewn
and
put
together
the
logs
,
had
done
so
with
admirable
skill
.
<EOS>
The
gaps
in
the
ends
had
been
cut
with
a
nicety
that
made
a
perfect
fit
in
every
case
.
<EOS>
Had
the
house
been
completed
,
it
certainly
would
have
been
a
substantial
one
.
<EOS>
While
the
absence
of
loop
-
holes
removed
to
a
great
extent
the
fear
of
treacherous
shots
from
the
outside
,
yet
in
another
respect
it
was
an
annoyance
.
<EOS>
The
boys
could
see
nothing
of
their
assailants
.
<EOS>
The
sense
of
hearing
and
conjecture
it
lelf
were
all
that
were
left
to
inform
them
of
what
was
going
on
so
near
them
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
to
be
supposed
that
the
Indians
,
after
driving
the
youths
into
shelter
,
would
leave
them
undisturbed
.
<EOS>
The
death
of
one
of
their
warriors
was
enough
to
rouse
the
passion
of
revenge
to
the
highest
point
—
a
necessity
which
,
as
shown
by
the
incidents
already
narrated
,
did
not
exist
.
<EOS>
When
Jack
and
Otto
were
given
a
little
time
for
reflection
,
they
were
forced
to
see
that
their
situation
was
hopeless
.
<EOS>
Every
advantage
was
with
their
enemies
,
who
,
if
they
chose
to
save
themselves
the
risk
of
a
determined
assault
,
had
only
to
wait
.
<EOS>
Without
food
or
water
,
with
no
means
of
leaving
the
place
,
the
hour
must
surely
come
when
exhausted
nature
would
compel
this
little
garrison
to
yield
.
<EOS>
The
boy
's
were
many
miles
from
the
settlements
on
either
side
of
the
river
,
and
there
was
no
means
of
sending
word
to
their
friends
of
the
dire
strait
in
which
they
were
placed
.
<EOS>
Even
could
such
message
reach
Coatesville
,
or
the
cabins
on
the
other
side
of
the
Mississippi
,
several
days
must
necessarily
elapse
before
assistance
could
arrive
.
<EOS>
Jack
Carleton
's
thoughts
naturally
turned
to
Deerfoot
the
Shawanoe
.
<EOS>
He
had
heard
so
many
stories
of
his
wonderful
woodcraft
and
skill
that
he
leaned
upon
him
,
when
he
was
present
to
lean
upon
;
but
,
hopeful
as
was
the
nature
of
the
young
Kentuckian
,
he
could
gather
no
crumbs
of
comfort
in
that
direction
.
<EOS>
Deerfoot
had
crossed
the
river
in
the
Miami
canoe
,
and
could
not
be
expected
to
return
until
under
cover
of
darkness
.
<EOS>
Even
then
he
must
be
powerless
.
<EOS>
There
are
limits
to
all
human
skill
,
and
what
greater
folly
than
to
expect
him
to
release
two
boys
,
shut
in
a
log
enclosure
,
and
surrounded
by
a
score
or
less
of
vigilant
Indian
warriors
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
not
the
nature
of
either
Jack
or
Otto
,
to
yield
without
a
struggle
.
<EOS>
So
long
as
they
could
fight
off
the
dread
end
,
so
long
they
would
put
,
forth
every
effort
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
For
fifteen
minutes
after
the
discharge
of
gun
absolute
silence
prevailed
.
<EOS>
Not
the
slightest
rustling
told
of
the
crouching
savages
without
.
<EOS>
The
boys
leaned
against
the
logs
of
waited
and
listened
.
<EOS>
During
the
interval
,
the
young
Kentuckian
became
filled
with
irresistible
curiosity
to
learn
what
their
enemies
were
doing
.
<EOS>
It
was
certain
they
were
plotting
mischief
,
but
he
could
form
no
idea
of
its
nature
.
<EOS>
How
was
he
to
gain
the
coveted
knowledge
?
<EOS>
Manifestly
there
was
but
the
one
way
.
<EOS>
“Otto
,
”
he
said
in
a
low
voice
,
“
I
'm
going
to
climb
up
the
logs
and
look
over
.
<EOS>
”“And
<EOS>
got
your
head
blown
off
,
<EOS>
dot
's
vot
<EOS>
you
does
!
”
<EOS>
exclaimed
his
horrified
friend
.
<EOS>
“I'll
come
to
that
sooner
or
later
any
way
,
”
was
the
reply
;
“
but
I
'm
not
going
to
be
shot
;
I
'm
not
such
a
dunce
as
that
;
I
mean
to
take
one
glance
over
the
logs
,
and
will
draw
back
so
quickly
that
no
one
will
get
a
chance
to
shoot
me
.
<EOS>
”Otto
<EOS>
protested
,
but
,
seeing
it
was
useless
,
gave
over
and
made
the
sensible
suggestion
that
,
instead
of
climbing
up
the
wall
and
thereby
probably
making
known
what
he
was
doing
,
he
should
stand
on
the
shoulders
of
Otto
.
<EOS>
That
would
give
him
enough
elevation
,
and
the
lad
added:“If
<EOS>
I
sees
any
noise
vot
I
do
n't
like
,
<EOS>
den
<EOS>
I
drops
you
so
quick
<EOS>
dot
<EOS>
you
vill
bump
the
ground
<EOS>
so
hard
dot
it
bulges
out
mit
China
on
de
other
side
.
<EOS>
”At
<EOS>
the
very
moment
Jack
made
ready
to
avail
himself
of
his
friend
's
support
<EOS>
,
they
heard
a
movement
on
the
part
of
the
Indians
,
the
meaning
of
which
was
not
understood
.
<EOS>
A
number
of
them
seemed
to
be
moving
heavily
over
the
ground
,
as
though
carrying
some
weighty
body
or
marching
in
military
step
.
<EOS>
The
boys
listened
closely
,
but
it
was
impossible
to
tell
what
it
meant
.
<EOS>
The
noise
added
to
Jack
's
curiosity
,
and
,
leaning
his
gun
against
the
logs
,
he
said”“Help
me
up
<EOS>
,
Otto
;
I
'm
bound
to
find
out
what
all
that
is
about
.
<EOS>
”It
<EOS>
was
an
easy
matter
to
mount
the
shoulders
of
his
young
friend
,
whose
strength
would
have
supported
double
his
weight
.
<EOS>
Jack
found
,
as
he
anticipated
,
that
he
would
be
able
to
look
over
the
logs
without
difficulty
.
<EOS>
Steadying
himself
by
placing
his
hand
against
the
wall
,
he
slowly
raised
his
head
until
almost
on
a
level
with
the
top
,
when
he
quietly
looked
over
.
<EOS>
No
movement
of
the
kind
was
expected
by
the
Indians
,
and
the
face
was
withdrawn
before
any
one
of
them
could
fire
.
<EOS>
Under
such
circumstances
,
a
person
can
see
a
great
deal
in
an
exceedingly
brief
space
of
time
.
<EOS>
Jack
Carleton
learned
much
about
that
which
had
excited
his
curiosity
.
<EOS>
Inasmuch
as
the
walls
had
been
put
up
from
material
cut
in
the
immediate
vicinity
,
a
number
of
stumps
surrounded
the
structure
,
beside
which
a
single
unused
log
was
lying
.
<EOS>
It
had
been
cut
entirely
off
at
the
base
,
several
of
the
lower
limbs
trimmed
,
but
most
of
the
bushy
top
remained
.
<EOS>
It
looked
as
if
the
builders
had
been
interrupted
while
at
work
,
or
they
had
voluntarily
abandoned
it
for
something
else
.
<EOS>
Some
six
or
eight
warriors
had
lifted
this
log
from
the
ground
and
were
laboriously
hearing
it
In
the
direction
of
the
fort
(
if
the
name
can
be
permitted
)
.
<EOS>
Others
were
moving
hither
and
thither
,
as
though
they
enjoyed
viewing
the
job
more
than
assisting
with
it
.
<EOS>
One
of
them
caught
sight
of
the
face
of
the
young
Kentuckian
and
brought
his
gun
to
his
shoulder
;
but
,
quick
as
he
was
,
he
was
just
a
moment
too
late
.
<EOS>
When
he
was
ready
to
fire
,
the
target
was
gone
.
<EOS>
“They're
going
to
batter
down
the
logs
!
”
<EOS>
exclaimed
Jack
,
dropping
lightly
to
the
ground
,
and
taking
possession
of
his
gun
;
“
they
're
carrying
a
log
toward
us
,
and
mean
to
hammer
these
down
about
our
heads
.
<EOS>
”“What
<EOS>
for
they
do
n't
want
to
do
<EOS>
dot?”“It
seems
to
me
it
would
be
a
good
plan
for
them
to
tumble
our
house
about
our
heads
.
<EOS>
”“I
<EOS>
do
n't
dink
they
doos
dots
,
”
persisted
the
German
,
and
he
proved
to
be
right
in
his
surmise
.
<EOS>
With
great
labor
the
warriors
bore
the
heavy
tree
forward
,
so
that
the
larger
end
was
against
the
side
of
the
fort
.
<EOS>
Then
,
instead
of
using
it
as
a
battering
ram
,
they
lifted
it
higher
until
,
with
an
exertion
that
must
have
been
very
great
,
it
was
raised
even
with
the
log
wall
.
<EOS>
A
combined
effort
rested
the
butt
on
the
support
,
the
trunk
sloping
downward
,
until
the
top
reached
the
ground
,
probably
thirty
feet
away
.
<EOS>
As
the
butt
was
a
foot
in
diameter
,
it
will
be
seen
that
the
work
must
have
been
very
onerous
to
the
American
Indian
,
who
hates
physical
labor
as
much
as
does
the
tramp
of
modern
times
.
<EOS>
Having
accomplished
what
must
be
admitted
to
be
quite
a
feat
,
the
toilers
rested
,
while
the
boys
looked
up
at
the
jagged
end
on
the
logs
,
suggesting
the
head
of
some
monster
peering
down
upon
them
,
and
speculated
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
movement
.
<EOS>
“Dot
is
so
to
help

said
Otto
,
“

Jack

,
meaning
a
little
different
from
what
his
words
implied
.
<EOS>
It
was
yet
early
in
the
day
,
and
the
boys
could
not
but
feel
that
the
crisis
was
sure
to
come
long
before
night
.
<EOS>
The
temperature
was
mild
and
pleasant
,
no
clouds
floating
in
the
space
of
clear
sky
visible
overhead
.
<EOS>
The
friends
kept
their
loaded
and
cocked
guns
in
their
hands
all
the
while
and
moved
to
and
fro
,
in
the
circumscribed
space
,
on
the
alert
for
the
first
demonstration
from
the
red
men
,
distressed
by
the
consciousness
that
their
cunning
enemies
were
sure
to
do
the
very
thing
which
was
least
expected
.
<EOS>
Jack
Carleton
noticed
that
whenever
he
stood
with
his
back
against
the
logs
,
he
could
see
the
upper
portions
of
the
trees
which
grew
close
to
the
structure
.
<EOS>
It
occurred
to
him
that
some
of
the
daring
warriors
were
liable
to
turn
the
fact
to
account
.
<EOS>
It
would
take
no
great
skill
for
one
or
two
of
them
to
climb
into
the
limbs
,
from
which
they
would
command
a
portion
of
the
interior
.
<EOS>
No
better
opportunity
could
be
asked
—
in
case
they
were
not
discovered
by
the
lads
—
to
fire
down
upon
them
.
<EOS>
“I've
been
dinking
of
dot
,
”
replied
Otto
,
when
the
matter
was
mentioned
;
“
and
I
dinks
dot
iss
de
tree
yonder
,
and
py
gracious
dere
is
an
Indian
'
mong
de
limbs!”This
startling
declaration
was
the
truth
.
<EOS>
The
friends
were
standing
at
the
eastern
end
of
the
structure
,
so
that
they
looked
in
the
direction
of
the
river
,
where
towered
a
bushy
oak
,
fully
twenty
feet
of
the
upper
portion
being
in
sight
.
<EOS>
Something
was
among
the
branches
,
though
the
object
could
not
be
seen
distinctly
.
<EOS>
Fortunate
it
was
that
both
were
gazing
toward
the
point
when
their
suspicion
was
first
awakened
.
<EOS>
“Yes
,
it
is
an
Indian
,
as
sure
as
I
live
!
”
<EOS>
added
Jack
,
in
an
excited
manner
.
<EOS>
“
Rash
fool
!
<EOS>
He
has
sealed
his
fate
,
for
I
could
n't
want
a
fairer
target
.
<EOS>
Leave
him
to
me!”“All
right
<EOS>
;
I
leaves
<EOS>
him!”The
young
Kentuckian
was
sure
of
his
man
,
even
though
he
was
only
partially
revealed
,
when
the
rifle
was
pointed
.
<EOS>
He
took
careful
aim
,
but
while
in
the
act
of
pressing
the
trigger
,
he
lowered
the
weapon
,
with
the
whispered
exclamation
.
<EOS>
“Great
heavens
!
<EOS>
It
is
Deerfoot
the
Shawanoe!”CHAPTER
XII
.
<EOS>
AMONG
THE
TREE
-
TOPSJack
Carleton
was
astounded
.
<EOS>
Up
to
that
moment
he
was
absolutely
certain
that
the
young
Shawanoe
was
on
the
other
side
of
the
Mississippi
,
and
would
make
no
attempt
to
return
to
the
Kentucky
shore
until
night
.
<EOS>
Yet
he
had
not
only
recrossed
,
but
was
actually
within
fifty
feet
of
the
enclosure
,
directly
among
his
fiercest
enemies
,
who
were
assailing
it
,
and
,
more
remarkable
than
all
,
he
had
climbed
among
the
limbs
of
a
tree
,
where
he
could
gain
a
view
of
the
interior
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
minute
or
so
during
which
the
Kentuckian
actually
doubted
his
own
senses
.
<EOS>
“He
must
be
an
enemy
who
closely
resembles
Deerfoot
,
”
was
his
thought
;
“
I
will
shoot
him
before
he
shoots
me
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
probability
of
such
being
the
case
was
increased
by
the
fact
that
the
Indian
had
a
rifle
instead
of
a
bow
and
arrow
,
and
there
were
some
daubs
of
paint
on
his
face
;
but
,
for
all
that
,
the
warrior
was
Deerfoot
,
as
a
second
scrutiny
convinced
Jack
and
Otto
beyond
all
question
.
<EOS>
“It
<EOS>
ish
Deerhead
!
<EOS>
I
means
Deerfoot
,
”
whispered
the
German
lad
;
“
dinks
a
whirlwind
<EOS>
lifs
him
out
te
boat
and
drops
him
in
de
tree
;
what
do
n't
he
vants?”The
<EOS>
young
Shawanoe
had
managed
to
reach
a
place
amid
the
foliage
,
where
,
if
he
could
be
seen
at
all
by
those
below
,
the
view
was
indistinct
,
while
,
by
pushing
the
branches
carefully
aside
in
front
of
his
face
,
he
was
plainly
revealed
to
his
friends
.
<EOS>
When
Jack
Carleton
raised
his
gun
and
sighted
at
the
object
in
the
tree
,
the
latter
swept
aside
the
curtain
in
front
and
made
a
signal
with
his
hand
,
which
declared
his
identity
.
<EOS>
Even
though
the
paint
had
been
plentifully
used
by
him
,
his
regular
features
were
recognized
when
he
smiled
,
and
kept
his
hand
waving
in
front
of
him
as
though
brushing
smoke
from
his
eyes
.
<EOS>
“Yes
,
it
's
Deerfoot
!
”
<EOS>
muttered
Jack
,
lowering
his
weapon
,
and
staring
with
open
mouth
at
the
figure
;
“
but
things
are
getting
mixed
,
and
I
ai
n't
exactly
understand
what
it
is
all
about
.
”
<EOS>
But
the
situation
was
too
critical
on
every
hand
for
the
young
friends
to
give
way
to
the
wonderment
caused
by
the
discovery
.
<EOS>
It
speedily
became
clear
that
while
the
Shawanoe
dare
not
speak
,
he
was
trying
very
hard
to
convey
some
message
to
his
friends
by
means
of
pantomime
.
<EOS>
Holding
the
gun
of
the
Miami
in
one
hand
,
he
kept
the
other
going
energetically
,
but
neither
Jack
nor
Otto
could
guess
his
meaning
.
<EOS>
“Speak
louder
!
”
called
Otto
,
forgetting
himself
;
“
vot
vasn't
<EOS>
dot
dot
<EOS>
you
did
n't
say?”Instantly
Deerfoot
drew
back
his
head
,
allowing
the
bushes
to
close
,
so
that
he
was
only
partly
revealed
.
<EOS>
“He
is
going
to
shoot
!
”
<EOS>
exclaimed
Jack
.
<EOS>
Such
,
it
was
evident
,
was
the
intention
of
their
friend
,
who
brought
his
rifle
to
a
level
,
the
black
barrel
plainly
visible
as
it
was
thrust
among
the
branches
.
<EOS>
Instead
of
being
aimed
downwards
,
it
was
pointed
at
a
considerable
elevation
above
the
defenders
at
some
object
at
the
other
side
of
the
fort
.
<EOS>
Turning
their
beads
,
the
boys
saw
,
from
the
agitation
in
the
branches
of
a
tree
,
almost
large
as
the
oak
,
that
something
was
moving
among
the
limbs
.
<EOS>
The
truth
flashed
upon
both
.
<EOS>
While
they
were
watching
their
friend
,
he
had
detected
an
enemy
stealing
into
the
tree
behind
them
,
and
sought
to
make
known
the
alarming
truth
by
means
of
gesture
.
<EOS>
Seeing
they
failed
to
catch
his
meaning
,
he
decided
to
attend
to
the
matter
himself
,
though
it
can
be
understood
that
the
shot
would
render
his
own
death
almost
certain
.
<EOS>
“That
will
never
do
!
”
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
young
Kentuckian
;
“
Deerfoot
is
too
valuable
to
be
sacrificed
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
savage
,
who
was
climbing
,
did
so
with
great
care
.
<EOS>
Now
a
beaded
moccasin
would
twinkle
alongside
the
trunk
,
whisking
out
of
sight
like
a
frolicking
squirrel
;
then
a
red
feather
flashed
to
sight
and
away
again
,
the
broad
,
painted
face
peeped
from
behind
the
tree
,
while
glimpses
of
the
clothing
here
<EOS>
and
there
showed
the
rate
with
which
the
warrior
went
upward
.
<EOS>
Deerfoot
must
have
seen
the
savage
at
the
moment
he
began
ascending
the
trunk
,
and
could
not
fail
to
know
his
purpose
.
<EOS>
It
was
all
-
important
that
the
dangerous
individual
should
be
“
attended
to
,
”
and
,
observing
that
his
friends
were
too
much
absorbed
in
watching
his
movements
to
remember
their
own
peril
,
the
friendly
Shawanoe
did
not
hesitate
to
take
the
frightful
risk
upon
himself
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
said
that
it
would
be
utterly
impossible
for
him
to
discharge
his
gun
from
the
elevation
without
the
other
warriors
discovering
the
fact
,
though
one
or
two
might
suspect
the
weapon
was
fired
within
the
enclosure
;
yet
it
was
characteristic
of
the
youth
that
,
when
the
necessity
presented
itself
,
he
did
not
hesitate
.
<EOS>
But
Jack
Carleton
's
presence
of
mind
came
to
his
assistance
.
<EOS>
He
began
such
vigorous
gestures
that
the
attention
of
Deerfoot
was
caught
;
without
lowering
his
gun
,
he
glanced
downward
.
<EOS>
He
saw
Jack
shaking
his
head
from
side
to
side
,
swinging
his
hand
back
and
forth
and
darting
his
finger
excitedly
at
the
tree
on
the
other
side
of
the
fort
.
<EOS>
The
quick
-
witted
Shawanoe
caught
his
meaning
,
and
took
his
gun
from
his
shoulder
.
<EOS>
Again
he
pushed
the
bushes
aside
,
so
that
his
face
came
to
view
,
and
,
looking
down
on
his
friends
,
smiled
,
nodded
,
and
made
several
gestures
toward
the
other
redskin
,
who
was
still
cautiously
climbing
the
tree
.
<EOS>
Then
the
curtain
was
drawn
again
,
and
Deerfoot
assumed
the
part
of
spectator
instead
of
actor
.
<EOS>
It
is
almost
incredible
that
this
performance
could
have
taken
place
without
detection
from
below
;
but
it
came
about
that
,
while
it
was
going
on
,
the
attention
of
the
red
men
was
occupied
by
another
occurrence
which
will
be
told
at
the
proper
time
.
<EOS>
The
only
ones
who
showed
any
interest
in
Deerfoot
and
his
enemy
,
steadily
making
his
way
aloft
,
were
the
boys
within
the
enclosure
.
<EOS>
Accepting
the
lesson
,
Jack
told
Otto
in
a
low
voice
to
keep
the
closest
watch
on
all
the
tree
-
tops
within
sight
,
for
it
seemed
likely
that
still
more
of
their
enemies
would
resort
to
the
same
strategy
.
<EOS>
“Let
there
be
no
mistake
about
this
,
”
he
said
to
his
companion
;
“
if
you
catch
sight
of
any
one
else
,
give
him
a
shot
,
but
I
'm
to
settle
the
question
with
this
particular
gentleman
.
<EOS>
”“Dot
<EOS>
ish
all
right
,
”
assented
Otto
;
<EOS>
“
dot
ish
,
it
will
be
all
right
if
he
ai
n't
all
wrong
when
you
hits
him
.
<EOS>
”Jack
<EOS>
Carleton
made
no
reply
.
<EOS>
He
was
standing
with
his
left
foot
thrown
slightly
forward
,
his
rifle
,
at
his
right
shoulder
,
his
head
inclined
and
his
left
eye
,
closed
.
<EOS>
He
was
following
the
movements
of
the
Miami
(
as
he
judged
him
to
be
)
,
who
was
seeking
a
perch
from
which
to
fire
down
on
the
defenders
of
the
primitive
fort
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
been
the
easiest
thing
in
the
world
for
our
friends
to
place
themselves
beyond
danger
from
that
particular
warrior
;
they
had
only
to
step
a
little
nearer
the
eastern
wall
,
when
it
would
intervene
between
them
and
the
savage
;
but
Jack
grasped
the
situation
well
enough
to
understand
the
advantage
of
impressing
their
assailants
with
the
danger
of
any
kind
of
attack
.
<EOS>
If
the
defenders
should
busy
themselves
with
dodging
the
aim
of
their
foes
,
the
trees
were
likely
to
swarm
with
them
,
and
it
would
become
impossible
to
elude
their
aim
.
<EOS>
As
before
,
the
climbing
Miami
afforded
occasional
glimpses
of
himself
.
<EOS>
Now
a
moccasin
,
then
a
hand
,
his
gun
,
the
black
horse
-
hair
-
like
covering
for
his
crown
,
with
the
painted
eagle
feathers
,
then
an
instant
gleam
of
the
eyes
,
and
then
nothing
at
all
.
<EOS>
Remembering
that
a
wound
would
be
as
effective
its
death
itself
,
Jack
coolly
waited
the
opportune
moment
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
he
saw
the
rifle
,
arm
and
shoulder
of
the
warrior
,
as
he
flung
them
partly
over
a
limb
to
help
draw
himself
upward
.
<EOS>
Without
a
second
's
delay
the
youth
fired
,
his
view
being
much
less
obstructed
than
was
the
care
with
his
friend
in
the
other
tree
.
<EOS>
An
ear
-
splitting
screech
broke
the
stillness
,
and
the
wounded
Miami
came
tumbling
downward
as
though
every
possible
support
had
given
way
beneath
him
.
<EOS>
To
the
watchful
lads
it
looked
as
if
he
struck
nothing
at
all
in
his
descent
,
but
fell
with
the
swiftness
of
a
cannon
-
ball
,
until
the
intervening
logs
shut
him
from
sight
.
<EOS>
“I
dinks
some
dings
dropped
,
”
said
Otto
,
with
a
grin
;
“
mebbe
he
do
n't
try
to
fool
us
some
more
agin
,
do
n't
it?”Jack
<EOS>
made
no
comment
,
but
,
as
was
his
rule
,
reloaded
his
gun
with
utmost
haste
,
dreading
all
the
time
a
rush
from
their
enemies
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
set
down
as
singular
that
something
of
the
kind
did
not
take
place
,
since
the
assailants
must
have
known
it
could
not
fail
to
be
effective
.
<EOS>
The
sagacious
Deerfoot
seemed
to
believe
that
his
position
was
no
longer
tenable
,
for
,
instead
of
staying
where
he
was
,
he
began
descending
,
apparently
in
panic
of
fear
,
lest
he
should
share
the
fate
of
the
other
red
man
.
<EOS>
So
far
as
he
could
,
he
kept
the
trunk
of
the
tree
between
him
and
the
youthful
marksmen
until
beyond
all
danger
of
being
harmed
.
<EOS>
Jack
saw
just
enough
of
the
movement
to
understand
its
meaning
,
and
he
smiled
grimly
.
<EOS>
“After
<EOS>
doing
what
you
have
done
,
you
ought
to
take
the
part
of
leader
and
draw
off
the
warriors
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
young
Kentuckian
stood
near
the
middle
of
the
enclosure
glancing
upward
in
different
directions
while
reloading
his
piece
,
for
he
understood
too
well
the
necessity
of
unremitting
vigilance
whenever
the
American
Indian
takes
a
hand
in
proceedings
.
<EOS>
Otto
was
not
behind
him
in
that
respect
.
<EOS>
He
walked
softly
around
the
fort
close
to
the
walls
,
attentively
listening
for
sounds
that
would
give
some
knowledge
of
what
was
going
on
outside
.
<EOS>
At
intervals
he
stopped
and
with
his
knife
gouged
the
wood
,
where
it
seemed
thinner
than
usual
,
but
in
every
case
found
the
thickness
too
great
to
be
pierced
.
<EOS>
Just
beneath
the
spot
where
the
butt
of
the
tree
rested
on
the
upper
edge
of
the
wall
,
he
stopped
Once
more
and
pressed
his
ear
against
the
logs
.
<EOS>
He
stood
fully
a
minute
,
when
,
without
moving
his
head
,
he
looked
sideways
at
his
friend
,
who
was
watching
him
.
<EOS>
The
expression
of
his
face
was
so
significant
that
Jack
knew
he
had
made
a
discovery
of
importance
.
<EOS>
“What
is
it
?
”
<EOS>
he
asked
.
<EOS>
Otto
motioned
for
him
to
keep
quiet
.
<EOS>
Jack
stepped
forward
in
front
of
him
.
<EOS>
As
Otto
was
looked
at
him
without
speaking
,
he
also
pressed
his
ear
against
the
logs
,
with
a
view
of
learning
what
was
going
on
.
<EOS>
Every
one
knows
that
wood
is
a
good
conductor
of
sound
,
and
,
though
in
this
case
there
were
several
layers
of
logs
through
which
the
noise
passed
,
the
second
listener
at
once
suspected
the
truth
.
<EOS>
The
scratching
of
the
bark
indicated
that
some
one
was
carefully
climbing
up
the
inclined
tree
.
<EOS>
“That
is
to
be
their
next
move
,
”
muttered
.
<EOS>
Jack
,
hastily
stepping
back
to
the
centre
of
the
space
;
“
if
they
make
a
rush
over
that
bridge
they
will
be
down
in
a
twinkling—”Otto
kept
his
position
,
with
his
ear
still
glued
to
the
logs
,
and
not
yet
certain
what
the
noise
meant
.
<EOS>
Just
as
Jack
looked
upward
he
saw
,
to
his
amazement
,
the
head
and
front
of
the
huge
black
bear
coming
up
the
inclined
tree
with
the
intent
purpose
of
entering
the
interior
.
<EOS>
It
instantly
occurred
to
the
youth
that
it
was
the
same
daring
bruin
that
came
so
near
attacking
them
a
short
while
before
.
<EOS>
He
has
used
this
place
as
his
den
and
means
to
return
to
it
;
the
Indians
have
seen
him
prowling
around
,
and
placed
the
tree
so
as
to
temp
him
to
climb
upward
on
it
.
<EOS>
The
beast
advanced
until
he
could
look
downward
on
the
couple
,
and
then
,
gazing
only
a
second
or
two
,
he
backed
out
of
sight
and
dropped
to
the
ground
with
a
strange
,
chuckling
growl
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
instant
a
feeling
of
unutterable
chagrin
came
over
the
lad
who
witnessed
the
maneuver
,
for
,
just
a
breath
too
late
,
he
comprehended
the
shrewd
trick
by
which
be
had
been
outwitted
.
<EOS>
Confused
by
the
unexpected
sight
,
he
failed
to
note
that
the
creature
was
not
a
bear
at
all
,
but
a
Shawanoe
warrior
skillfully
disguised
as
much
.
<EOS>
With
the
skin
of
one
of
the
beasts
gathered
over
his
head
and
shoulders
,
he
had
made
his
way
up
the
support
,
peered
at
the
defenders
,
and
then
withdrawn
before
the
watchful
Jack
could
tumble
him
to
the
earth
with
the
bullet
that
would
have
pierced
his
body
<EOS>
had
five
seconds
more
been
given
in
which
to
aim
and
fire
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
XIII
.
<EOS>
A
MESSAGEJack
's
chagrin
was
deepened
the
more
he
reflected
upon
the
singular
occurrence
.
<EOS>
Had
he
been
outwitted
by
some
skillfully
-
executed
trick
of
the
Indians
,
he
would
have
accepted
it
as
a
mishap
liable
to
overthrow
the
most
experienced
ranger
of
the
woods
;
but
he
felt
he
ought
to
have
known
on
the
instant
that
no
real
bear
would
have
attempted
anything
of
the
kind
.
<EOS>
There
was
not
a
phase
of
the
artifice
which
was
not
a
reproach
to
him
.
<EOS>
Had
the
beast
used
the
enclosure
as
a
den
or
a
retreat
—
a
thing
of
itself
incredible
—
the
evidence
of
that
fact
would
have
been
noticed
the
moment
the
boys
climbed
within
.
<EOS>
Then
the
likelihood
of
his
clambering
up
the
inclined
tree
in
the
presence
of
a
war
party
of
Shawanoes
and
Miamis
,
who
had
laid
it
for
that
very
purpose
,
was
too
grotesquely
absurd
to
be
thought
of
with
patience
.
<EOS>
“Maybe
<EOS>
it
is
as
well
,
”
he
said
,
with
an
effort
to
extract
some
consolation
from
the
blunder
;
“
for
perhaps
it
will
lead
them
to
repeat
the
trick
.
<EOS>
”“Mine
<EOS>
gracious
!
<EOS>
why
did
n't
he
drop
down
onto
mine
bead
?
”
<EOS>
said
Otto
,
stepping
hastily
away
from
his
position
;
“
he
would
have
mashed
me
out
as
flat
as—-as
—
as
a
big
tree
itself
.
<EOS>
”“I
<EOS>
do
n't
see
why
they
did
n't
form
a
procession
of
bears
and
walk
right
over
among
us
?
<EOS>
We
would
have
stood
still
and
allowed
them
to
hug
us
to
death
.
<EOS>
”Admitting
<EOS>
the
only
explanation
that
presented
itself
,
Jack
and
Otto
were
not
yet
able
fully
to
account
for
the
proceeding
.
<EOS>
The
labor
of
dragging
the
fallen
trunk
and
lifting
the
butt
to
the
wall
,
seemed
too
great
to
suppose
it
was
to
be
used
only
to
allow
one
of
the
Indians
to
climb
to
the
top
and
peer
over
upon
the
boys
beneath
.
<EOS>
The
same
thing
could
be
accomplished
by
ascending
one
of
the
trees
and
avoiding
the
peril
to
which
some
of
them
had
been
exposed
.
<EOS>
But
,
beside
all
that
,
what
in
reality
was
gained
by
taking
a
peep
at
the
youths
?
<EOS>
The
assailants
knew
they
were
there
,
and
it
could
not
matter
a
jot
in
what
particular
manner
they
were
employing
themselves
.
<EOS>
They
could
do
nothing
that
could
give
those
on
the
outside
the
slightest
concern
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
defenders
whose
interests
required
the
anticipation
of
the
movements
of
the
warriors
.
<EOS>
“I
ca
n't
understand
it
,
”
said
Jack
,
standing
close
to
his
friend
and
talking
in
a
low
voice
.
<EOS>
“So
<EOS>
ai
n't
I
—
harks!”They
<EOS>
listened
a
full
minute
,
but
the
silence
could
not
have
been
more
profound
.
<EOS>
A
gentle
wind
stirred
the
leaves
overhead
,
and
the
tops
of
the
trees
nearest
them
could
be
seen
slightly
swaying
against
the
clear
sky
beyond
.
<EOS>
The
murmur
of
the
great
forest
was
like
the
voice
of
silence
itself
while
the
almost
inaudible
murmur
of
the
Mississippi
,
sweeping
so
near
,
made
itself
manifest
the
first
time
since
they
had
turned
at
bay
.
<EOS>
The
deep
quiet
was
more
impressive
than
the
whoops
and
screeches
of
the
warriors
would
have
been
.
<EOS>
Under
such
circumstances
,
it
boded
mischief
,
and
the
utter
uncertainty
of
its
nature
almost
unsettled
the
remarkable
courage
both
up
to
that
moment
had
displayed
.
<EOS>
“I
hears
nodings
,
”
added
Otto
;
<EOS>
“
I'mebbe
do
n't
go
to
sleep
and
wait
for
the
night
to
come
.
<EOS>
”“Night
<EOS>
is
a
good
many
hours
off
,
”
replied
Jack
,
with
an
uneasy
glance
at
the
sky
,
which
showed
him
the
sun
had
not
yet
reached
meridian
;
“
they
can
beat
any
people
in
the
world
waiting
,
when
they
have
a
mind
to
do
so
,
but
there
's
been
no
necessity
of
halting
at
all
.
<EOS>
If
they
had
followed
up
over
the
logs
it
would
have
been
all
ended
by
this
time
.
<EOS>
”“Yaw
<EOS>
;
they
would
have
tumbled
all
over
us
,
like
a
pig
lot
of
trees
falling
down
,
but
now
I
dinks
they
waits
.
<EOS>
”“Why
<EOS>
will
they
do
<EOS>
that?”“If
dey
climbs
over
like
as
dey
did
n't
does
,
don
somepody
git
hurt
,
but
if
dey
holds
on
till
night
den
we
'll
have
to
climb
over
and
falls
on
'
em
.
<EOS>
”This
was
Otto
's
manner
of
expressing
what
was
inevitable
,
in
case
the
besiegers
should
conclude
to
wait
for
the
hour
,
which
could
not
be
very
distant
,
when
the
defenders
must
lose
all
power
of
resistance
.
<EOS>
The
two
did
not
forget
to
keep
a
continuous
guard
over
the
“
watch
-
towers
”
of
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
Despite
the
repulse
that
had
followed
their
attempts
,
it
was
by
no
means
uncertain
that
they
would
not
repeat
them
.
<EOS>
The
success
of
the
bear
trick
was
likely
to
tempt
them
to
another
essay
in
the
same
direction
.
<EOS>
Otto
Relstaub
was
leaning
against
the
solid
logs
,
his
position
such
that
the
sun
,
which
was
now
near
meridian
,
shone
directly
upon
him
.
<EOS>
His
friend
was
almost
immediately
opposite
—
the
two
looking
in
each
other
's
face
,
and
exchanging
words
in
low
tones
.
<EOS>
All
at
once
the
German
became
sensible
of
something
cool
just
behind
his
neck
.
<EOS>
“Vot
ai
n't
dot
?
”
<EOS>
he
said
,
putting
up
his
hand
as
though
to
brush
away
some
insect
.
<EOS>
Striking
nothing
,
he
turned
to
look
.
<EOS>
“O
<EOS>
-
<EOS>
oh
<EOS>
-
oh
!
”
<EOS>
he
said
,
with
a
wondering
expression
,
and
an
expansion
of
his
big
,
honest
eyes
.
<EOS>
“There
's
an
opening
behind
you
,
”
remarked
his
friend
,
moving
hastily
across
to
where
he
stood
.
<EOS>
“Yaw
<EOS>
;
I
sees
him
.
<EOS>
Where
's
he
been
hiding
himself
when
I
voon't
looking
for
him
not
a
little
while
ago
.
<EOS>
”It
<EOS>
certainly
was
curious
that
both
boys
should
have
made
such
a
minute
examination
of
the
interior
without
finding
the
crevice
between
a
couple
of
the
logs
,
large
enough
to
admit
the
passage
of
several
bullets
,
and
through
which
it
would
have
been
an
easy
matter
for
their
enemies
to
shoot
him
who
stood
immediately
in
front
.
<EOS>
The
opening
was
some
six
inches
wide
,
and
no
more
than
an
eighth
of
an
inch
in
height
,
resembling
the
crevice
through
which
the
captain
looks
out
upon
the
enemy
from
the
turret
of
a
monitor
.
<EOS>
The
fact
that
the
red
men
had
made
no
use
of
it
was
proof
they
did
not
suspect
its
existence
,
though
that
did
not
lessen
the
wonder
of
Otto
that
he
had
failed
to
find
it
himself
,
when
making
search
.
<EOS>
“I
see
!
”
<EOS>
suddenly
exclaimed
Jack
,
who
was
attentively
examining
the
place
.
<EOS>
“
No
wonder
you
missed
it
,
for
it
was
closed
up
.
<EOS>
You
must
have
rubbed
one
of
your
long
ears
against
the
stick
which
fits
it
so
closely
.
<EOS>
”The
piece
with
which
it
had
been
closed
lay
on
the
ground
,
at
the
feet
of
the
boys
,
and
made
clear
why
they
had
failed
to
find
that
for
which
they
had
hunted
so
carefully
.
<EOS>
Jack
cut
the
stick
apart
with
his
knife
and
reinserted
one
half
with
a
view
of
rendering
it
less
liable
to
attract
the
notice
of
the
besiegers
.
<EOS>
Then
,
quite
sure
that
it
was
still
unknown
to
them
,
he
leaned
forward
with
his
eye
to
the
opening
.
<EOS>
“While
<EOS>
I
'm
peeping
here
<EOS>
keep
a
lookout
elsewhere
,
Otto
.
<EOS>
”His
<EOS>
friend
nodded
,
to
signify
he
would
be
obeyed
,
and
then
Jack
took
a
survey
of
his
surroundings
.
<EOS>
It
so
happened
that
he
stood
nearly
under
the
tree
which
leaned
against
the
wall
,
and
thus
gained
a
good
view
.
<EOS>
He
certainly
saw
enough
to
interest
the
most
indifferent
spectator
.
<EOS>
Five
painted
Indian
warriors
were
seen
standing
around
what
seemed
to
be
a
dancing
bear
,
who
was
gesticulating
with
his
fore
paws
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
he
cast
off
the
shaggy
hide
and
revealed
the
redskin
who
bad
made
the
audacious
ascent
on
the
log
in
his
disguise
and
peeped
over
on
the
boys
below
.
<EOS>
He
seemed
to
be
talking
with
his
friends
,
while
the
whole
half
dozen
were
gesticulating
with
great
energy
,
though
,
in
spite
of
their
excitement
,
their
words
were
spoken
so
low
that
our
friends
could
hear
little
more
than
the
jumbling
murmur
of
their
voices
.
<EOS>
No
doubt
more
Indians
were
close
at
hand
,
but
Jack
saw
none
.
<EOS>
He
stealthily
removed
the
other
part
of
the
stick
,
and
thereby
widened
his
view
considerably
,
but
he
still
failed
to
discover
anything
more
.
<EOS>
His
vision
took
in
the
tree
up
which
Deerfoot
had
climbed
,
but
nothing
was
to
be
observed
of
him
,
or
of
any
others
gathered
around
the
base
.
<EOS>
Convinced
that
they
were
on
the
other
side
of
the
fort
,
Jack
gave
his
whole
attention
to
those
before
him
.
<EOS>
It
looked
very
much
as
if
the
author
of
the
trick
described
was
regaling
his
friends
with
an
account
of
the
highly
successful
manner
in
which
he
had
played
his
points
on
the
unsuspecting
parties
within
the
enclosure
.
<EOS>
Jack
was
convinced
that
the
rifle
-
shot
which
he
and
his
friend
heard
,
before
rushing
into
the
refuge
,
was
the
one
that
slew
the
bear
.
<EOS>
The
Indians
had
hastily
skinned
the
animal
,
probably
completing
the
task
near
the
time
they
became
aware
of
the
presence
or
rather
the
flight
of
the
two
boys
.
<EOS>
They
had
united
in
the
pursuit
,
taking
the
bear
-
skin
with
them
,
and
its
use
in
the
,
manner
described
was
suggested
by
the
prostrate
tree
lying
so
close
to
the
logs
,
though
even
that
theory
failed
fully
to
satisfy
the
questions
of
the
youth
.
<EOS>
Another
interesting
discovery
was
that
he
had
seen
two
of
the
Shawanoes
before
.
<EOS>
He
had
no
difficulty
in
recognizing
them
as
those
who
had
shown
such
eagerness
to
follow
the
trail
of
the
hunter
that
had
shot
the
panther
some
distance
back
on
the
path
.
<EOS>
The
warrior
who
had
masqueraded
in
the
character
of
a
big
,
black
bear
belonged
to
the
Miami
tribe
,
the
representatives
of
the
two
joining
hands
in
the
crusade
against
the
young
pioneers
.
<EOS>
Neither
the
wounded
red
man
nor
the
one
who
was
past
wounding
was
to
be
seen
anywhere
.
<EOS>
The
vigorous
and
somewhat
suppressed
conversation
among
the
group
continued
a
few
minutes
and
then
abruptly
stopped
.
<EOS>
The
entire
party
seemed
to
have
become
“
talked
out
”
the
same
instant
.
<EOS>
“Now
<EOS>
they
will
hatch
up
some
more
mischief
,
”
was
the
thought
of
the
watcher
.
<EOS>
“
I
do
n't
think
it
likely
they
will
send
that
bear
up
the
tree
again
.
<EOS>
If
they
do
he
will
come
down
a
little
quicker
than
he
goes
up
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
sensations
of
the
young
Kentuckian
were
very
peculiar
,
when
he
became
aware
that
the
Shawanoe
who
had
displayed
so
much
skill
in
hunting
for
his
footprints
in
the
twilight
was
looking
directly
toward
him
.
<EOS>
He
seemed
in
fact
to
be
gazing
into
the
eyes
of
the
youth
,
as
though
he
was
striving
to
stare
him
out
of
countenance
.
<EOS>
Jack
would
have
been
glad
at
that
moment
had
the
opening
been
hermetically
sealed
;
but
,
hopeful
that
he
was
not
seen
,
he
held
his
place
,
not
stirring
in
the
slightest
,
and
striving
to
the
utmost
to
keep
from
winking
his
eyes
.
<EOS>
The
singular
tableau
lasted
much
less
time
than
the
boy
imagined
.
<EOS>
All
at
once
the
hum
of
conversation
was
renewed
,
every
one
of
the
half
dozen
seeming
to
be
seized
with
the
impulse
at
the
same
moment
.
<EOS>
He
who
had
been
gazing
so
steadily
at
Jack
looked
in
the
face
of
one
of
his
comrades
.
<EOS>
Instantly
the
boy
moved
to
one
side
and
replaced
the
rest
of
the
stick
,
so
that
the
crevice
was
closed
once
more
.
<EOS>
“There
,
”
he
exclaimed
,
with
a
sigh
,
“
I
never
was
placed
in
a
more
trying
situation
than

”“Vot
voon't

dot?”Jack
quickly
told
his
experience
,
and
his
companion
shuddered
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
in
sympathy
.
<EOS>
“Have
<EOS>
you
seen
any
of
them

the
trees?”“No

<EOS>
They
vill
not

”“It
wo

do
to
calculate
on
that

<EOS>
If
they
wait
they
will
try
some
new
tricks
.
<EOS>
”“Vot

trouble
is
we
can
not
guess
.
<EOS>
You
know
the
Indians
are
so
cunning
that
they
will
think
out
something—”Zip!Both
boys
started
and
looked
around
.
<EOS>
Something
had
entered
the
enclosure
like
a
bullet
fired
from
a
gun
.
<EOS>
“Look
!
”
<EOS>
whispered
Jack
,
pointing
to
the
other
side
,
where
an
Indian
arrow
was
seen
sticking
in
the
logs
,
at
a
point
half
way
between
the
ground
and
the
top
.
<EOS>
“I
dinks
they
used
guns
and
not
arrows
,
”
said
the
astonished
,
Otto
,
standing
motionless
and
staring
at
the
missile
,
whose
barb
was
still
trembling
from
the
force
with
which
it
had
been
driven
into
the
solid
wood
.
<EOS>
“They
do
use
guns
only
,
”
said
Jack
.
<EOS>
“
That
arrow
was
fired
by
Deerfoot!”“Dere
is

it

<EOS>
”“It
<EOS>
is
a
message
from
Deerfoot
!
”
<EOS>
said
Jack
,
stepping
forward
and
,
with
considerable
effort
,
drawing
forth
the
arrow
.

CHAPTER
XIV
.
<EOS>
THE
MANEUVRES
OF
DEERFOOTDeerfoot
the
Shawanoe
committed
a
serious
mistake
as
he
himself
was
the
first
to
discover
,
when
he
upset
the
Miami
warrior
into
the
Mississippi
and
made
off
with
his
canoe
.
<EOS>
He
had
started
out
to
help
his
friends
,
but
his
course
was
an
injury
to
them
,
for
it
increased
their
danger
without
giving
them
the
least
assistance
.
<EOS>
What
he
ought
to
have
done
,
when
he
observed
the
drowsy
fisherman
,
was
to
bring
the
boys
to
the
spot
,
so
that
,
directly
after
the
red
man
was
dispossessed
,
the
three
could
have
entered
the
boat
and
hastened
across
the
river
.
<EOS>
Had
he
done
so
,
all
that
which
followed
would
have
be
averted
.
<EOS>
In
referring
to
the
course
of
the
young
Shawano
the
most
incredible
statement
is
that
the
blunder
was
altogether
due
to
his
waggishness
,
because
in
his
eagerness
to
play
a
joke
upon
an
enemy
,
he
forgot
his
usual
caution
;
but
such
was
the
truth
.
<EOS>
The
warrior
,
however
,
was
not
the
one
to
stay
on
the
western
shore
when
his
friends
were
in
danger
.
<EOS>
Though
he
had
told
them
to
expect
him
back
at
a
certain
hour
,
early
in
the
afternoon
,
his
intention
was
to
return
much
earlier
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
been
folly
for
him
to
make
for
any
point
near
that
from
which
he
departed
when
he
set
out
from
the
Kentucky
shore
.
<EOS>
Such
a
proceeding
would
be
seen
by
his
enemies
,
and
would
invite
them
to
riddle
him
with
bullets
as
he
approached
.
<EOS>
The
moment
he
touched
the
Louisiana
side
,
he
ran
under
the
overhanging
limbs
far
enough
to
be
out
of
sight
of
any
who
might
be
on
the
watch
,
and
then
pushed
vigorously
up
stream
.
<EOS>
He
continued
until
he
had
gone
fully
a
half
mile
and
had
rounded
quite
a
bend
in
the
river
.
<EOS>
Then
he
paddled
straight
across
to
the
other
bank
,
down
which
he
made
his
way
with
the
same
haste
.
<EOS>
He
speedily
arrived
in
the
vicinity
of
the
lads
and
prepared
,
in
his
characteristic
fashion
,
to
take
a
hand
in
their
rescue
.
<EOS>
Hoping
that
the
chance
for
flight
would
speedily
come
,
he
carefully
drew
the
canoe
under
cover
,
where
he
was
confident
it
would
not
be
seen
by
any
enemies
prowling
in
the
vicinity
.
<EOS>
Then
he
stealthily
plunged
into
the
wood
to
give
what
help
he
could
to
his
friends
.
<EOS>
It
took
him
only
a
little
while
to
find
they
were
at
bay
within
the
log
enclosure
and
in
much
greater
danger
than
he
first
supposed
.
<EOS>
The
discovery
caused
a
change
in
his
plans
.
<EOS>
He
returned
to
the
canoe
and
took
out
the
rifle
which
he
had
captured
;
his
bow
and
,
arrows
were
not
left
within
the
boat
,
for
he
valued
them
too
highly
to
incur
such
risk
;
they
were
hidden
where
he
knew
no
one
could
possibly
steal
them
away
from
him
.
<EOS>
Then
the
little
phial
which
he
carried
in
the
receptacle
with
his
Bible
was
uncorked
and
the
crimson
paint
applied
with
his
forefinger
to
his
face
.
<EOS>
The
ornamentation
was
as
fantastical
as
the
imagination
of
the
native
American
could
make
it
.
<EOS>
Viewed
for
the
first
time
by
those
who
did
not
know
him
,
he
would
have
been
classed
as
one
of
the
fiercest
warriors
that
ever
went
on
the
war
trail
.
<EOS>
Had
he
been
a
pagan
instead
of
a
Christian
,
the
idea
would
have
been
a
correct
one
.
<EOS>
But
Deerfoot
was
handicapped
from
the
first
by
the
fact
that
he
was
known
to
more
than
one
of
the
party
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
said
that
at
that
day
there
was
scarcely
a
Shawanoe
east
of
the
Mississippi
who
had
not
heard
of
the
execrated
friend
of
the
white
men
.
<EOS>
They
knew
that
his
favorite
weapons
,
beside
his
knife
and
tomahawk
,
were
his
bow
and
arrows
;
that
his
skill
with
them
approached
the
marvelous
;
they
knew
that
his
fleetness
surpassed
that
of
any
living
person
that
he
possessed
a
form
and
features
of
rare
beauty
;
that
his
courage
was
surpassed
by
none
,
for
,
when
but
a
stripling
,
he
had
handed
a
knife
to
the
furious
Tecumseh
,
and
dared
him
to
fight
unto
the
death
,
and
that
his
cunning
and
subtlety
were
beyond
the
reach
of
the
ordinary
warrior
.
<EOS>
Deerfoot
himself
was
aware
of
his
general
notoriety
,
and
,
though
he
might
not
have
been
seen
by
the
Shawanoes
,
yet
they
would
identify
him
at
the
first
glance
,
provided
he
appeared
before
them
in
his
own
proper
person
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
understood
,
therefore
,
why
he
disguised
his
appearance
with
such
care
.
<EOS>
With
the
shrewdness
of
one
of
our
modern
detectives
,
he
made
a
change
also
,
as
may
be
said
,
in
“
himself
”
that
is
,
he
walked
differently
,
and
used
his
arms
and
legs
in
style
altogether
foreign
to
his
custom
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
remembered
that
there
were
several
strong
points
in
his
favor
;
his
was
the
tribe
whose
warriors
hated
him
with
unspeakable
hatred
,
and
he
therefore
was
a
master
of
every
detail
.
<EOS>
When
he
was
assisted
by
the
gloom
of
night
,
he
was
in
scarcely
any
danger
,
though
it
was
far
different
under
the
glare
of
the
sun
.
<EOS>
Another
advantage
should
be
named
,
inasmuch
as
the
reader
is
apt
to
overlook
it
;
the
separate
war
parties
from
the
Shawanoe
and
Miami
tribes
were
not
only
few
in
numbers
,
but
they
had
not
met
until
after
arriving
in
the
neighborhood
where
the
youthful
pioneers
were
traveling
with
little
fear
of
molestation
.
<EOS>
Thus
,
in
a
certain
sense
,
the
warriors
,
while
allies
,
were
comparative
strangers
.
<EOS>
After
disguising
himself
he
believed
his
identity
would
not
be
discovered
by
the
Miamis
,
unless
,
possibly
,
by
the
lone
fisherman
.
<EOS>
There
was
also
a
fair
prospect
that
he
could
avert
suspicion
for
a
time
on
the
part
of
the
Shawanoes
,
unless
particular
attention
was
directed
to
him
.
<EOS>
The
foregoing
seems
necessary
in
order
to
justify
what
was
done
by
the
wonderful
Deerfoot
.
<EOS>
He
managed
to
appear
on
the
outer
fringe
of
the
ring
of
assailants
,
without
drawing
special
notice
,
and
he
used
all
his
skill
in
learning
what
the
assailants
intended
to
do
.
<EOS>
The
warrior
who
had
been
shot
while
in
the
act
of
climbing
over
the
logs
after
the
boys
,
met
his
fate
before
Deerfoot
arrived
on
the
scene
.
<EOS>
The
Indians
were
in
a
revengeful
mood
,
and
were
unanimous
in
their
determination
to
visit
the
worst
punishment
on
the
youths
who
were
making
such
a
brave
fight
for
their
lives
.
<EOS>
“But
for
Deerfoot
they
would
not
be
in
this
sad
plight
,
”
was
the
thought
of
the
young
Shawanoe
;
“
therefore
the
Great
Spirit
expects
Deerfoot
not
to
think
of
his
own
life
until
they
are
saved
from
the
death
which
threatens
them
.
<EOS>
”Fortunately
<EOS>
for
this
purpose
the
warriors
were
scattered
to
a
considerable
extent
,
and
seemed
to
give
their
whole
thoughts
to
those
within
the
enclosure
.
<EOS>
Deerfoot
knew
,
when
he
observed
the
heavy
log
borne
forward
,
and
the
butt
placed
on
the
wall
,
that
it
was
meant
to
be
used
to
carry
out
some
plan
not
clearly
settled
in
the
minds
of
the
assailants
themselves
.
<EOS>
When
he
saw
a
move
to
climb
the
trees
which
stood
near
the
rude
fort
,
he
feared
his
friends
would
be
caught
unawares
,
and
he
took
to
a
tree
with
the
hope
of
being
able
to
give
them
warning
in
time
.
<EOS>
On
this
point
it
will
be
seen
the
young
warrior
underrated
the
woodcraft
of
his
friends
.
<EOS>
With
a
thrill
of
pleasure
he
glanced
at
the
rifle
of
Jack
Carleton
<EOS>
pointed
at
him
,
before
he
had
sought
to
open
communication
.
<EOS>
It
was
only
a
natural
precaution
which
led
him
to
select
a
tree
where
he
was
able
to
use
the
sign
language
,
without
being
seen
by
any
of
his
enemies
below
.
<EOS>
He
made
sure
that
enough
foliage
intervened
to
screen
him
from
the
inquiring
gaze
of
his
enemies
during
the
proceeding
.
<EOS>
Having
made
certain
that
his
identity
was
known
to
his
friends
,
it
will
be
remembered
that
the
sought
to
warn
them
of
the
very
peril
which
threatened
from
the
tree
on
the
other
side
.
<EOS>
Failing
to
make
himself
clear
,
he
raised
his
own
gun
with
the
intention
of
shooting
the
savage
from
the
perch
,
but
providentially
Otto
Relstaub
averted
the
necessity
.
<EOS>
It
is
difficult
to
believe
that
had
Deerfoot
fired
the
shot
he
could
have
effected
his
own
escape
.
<EOS>
The
point
from
which
the
gun
was
discharged
must
have
made
itself
manifest
to
more
than
one
warrior
below
,
and
would
have
involved
him
in
a
labyrinth
of
peril
,
where
his
subtlety
must
have
failed
him
.
<EOS>
But
it
need
not
be
repeated
that
he
would
not
have
faltered
on
that
account
,
had
the
need
existed
.
<EOS>
He
believed
it
his
duty
to
hesitate
at
no
risk
,
because
he
himself
was
wholly
to
blame
for
the
dire
straits
in
which
the
boys
found
themselves
.
<EOS>
With
a
grim
enjoyment
that
can
hardly
be
understood
,
Deerfoot
stood
in
the
background
and
watched
the
antics
of
the
warrior
who
had
wrapped
the
bear
-
skin
about
his
shoulders
and
body
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
avoid
a
feeling
of
admiration
for
the
cleverness
with
which
the
front
was
arranged
,
so
as
to
resemble
that
of
the
beast
,
but
he
felt
not
the
slightest
fear
that
the
trick
would
succeed
.
<EOS>
It
was
such
an
antiquated
stratagem
that
he
wondered
it
was
attempted
,
especially
after
the
defenders
had
given
so
convincing
evidence
of
their
watchfulness
.
<EOS>
His
amazement
,
therefore
,
may
be
appreciated
when
he
saw
the
creature
slowly
make
his
way
to
the
edge
of
the
fort
,
look
down
on
the
boys
,
and
then
back
a
few
steps
and
drop
to
ground
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
believe
they
had
failed
penetrate
a
disguise
which
could
scarcely
hope
to
deceive
,
except
under
very
favoring
circumstance
but
concluded
they
must
have
refrained
good
reason
of
their
own
.
<EOS>
While
these
troublesome
thoughts
were
in
the
mind
of
Deerfoot
,
he
kept
his
eye
on
the
Miami
,
whose
scant
clothing
had
not
dried
after
his
voluntary
plunge
into
the
Mississippi
,
from
the
bow
of
his
canoe
.
<EOS>
His
victim
acted
as
though
he
entertained
some
doubts
as
to
the
identity
of
the
individual
that
did
not
mingle
with
the
main
body
of
the
warriors
.
<EOS>
Deerfoot
knew
that
if
he
did
suspect
the
truth
,
his
curiosity
was
likely
to
cause
trouble
.
<EOS>
The
time
had
come
when
it
was
the
part
of
wisdom
to
withdraw
.
<EOS>
At
last
the
Miami
walked
toward
the
enclosure
,
where
two
of
his
own
tribe
were
talking
same
number
of
the
Shawanoes
.
<EOS>
He
said
something
which
stirred
up
matters
at
once
.
<EOS>
All
five
began
talking
vigorously
,
and
then
they
turned
take
a
look
at
the
youthful
warrior
.
<EOS>
He
was
gone
,
having
vanished
as
silently
as
he
appeared
on
the
scene
,
and
it
was
well
that
he
did
so
,
for
the
deception
could
have
been
carried
no
further
.
<EOS>
Within
the
succeeding
ten
minutes
the
report
of
a
rifle
came
from
the
direction
of
the
river
.
<EOS>
Then
a
second
was
heard
from
another
point
in
the
wood
,
and
again
a
third
report
awoke
the
echoes
among
the
trees
.
<EOS>
The
red
men
did
not
know
what
it
meant
.
<EOS>
All
the
surviving
members
of
the
two
parties
were
together
,
and
they
could
not
understand
who
the
new
comers
were
.
<EOS>
They
were
probably
those
of
their
own
race
,
though
the
discomforting
possibility
remained
that
they
might
be
white
men
on
their
way
to
the
help
of
the
beleaguered
boys
.
<EOS>
The
truth
was
,
Deerfoot
was
convinced
that
if
Jack
and
Otto
were
not
extricated
from
their
peril
long
before
night
,
no
hope
could
remain
for
them
.
<EOS>
It
was
so
clearly
in
the
power
of
the
red
men
to
capture
or
destroy
them
whenever
they
chose
to
put
forth
the
effort
,
that
he
knew
they
would
not
wait
until
night
.
<EOS>
There
were
trees
on
every
hand
which
would
shelter
the
sharp
-
shooters
.
<EOS>
If
they
ensconced
themselves
among
the
limbs
of
these
,
the
lads
would
be
shut
off
from
the
chance
of
protecting
themselves
,
for
on
whichsoever
side
of
the
space
they
stood
,
they
would
be
within
the
range
of
one
or
two
of
the
gunners
.
<EOS>
The
plan
which
he
next
proceeded
to
put
into
execution
was
in
the
mind
of
Deerfoot
from
the
first
moment
be
learned
of
the
situation
of
the
endangered
ones
.
<EOS>
It
was
impossible
to
succeed
without
a
perfect
understanding
with
his
friends
,
for
they
necessarily
had
an
important
part
to
play
in
the
programme
.
<EOS>
“Deerfoot
will
send
them
a
message
,
”
he
said
to
himself
,
with
a
throb
of
pride
over
the
facility
at
his
command
;
“
that
will
tell
everything
.
”Making
<EOS>
his
way
to
a
safe
point
in
the
forest
,
he
sat
down
on
the
ground
,
tore
off
a
piece
from
the
paper
which
he
carried
with
his
Bible
,
and
with
red
chalk
,
sharpened
to
a
point
,
he
proceeded
to
write
the
words
intended
only
for
the
eyes
of
his
friends
within
the
enclosure
.
<EOS>
The
paper
was
twisted
around
the
arrow
,
just
back
of
the
bead
,
and
he
then
was
ready
to
adopt
the
means
which
he
had
employed
more
than
once
in
somewhat
similar
situations
.

CHAPTER
XV
.
<EOS>
“
TALL
OAKS
FROM
LITTLE
ACORNS
GROW”Jack
Carleton
walked
across
the
slight
space
that
separated
him
from
the
arrow
,
quivering
in
the
log
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
enclosure
.
<EOS>
He
knew
that
it
had
come
from
the
bow
of
the
young
Shawanoe
,
who
displayed
his
extraordinary
skill
by
sending
it
at
such
an
elevation
that
it
passed
over
the
heads
of
his
friends
.
<EOS>
“It
is
a
message
from
Deerfoot
,
”
repeated
the
Kentuckian
,
as
he
drew
out
the
missile
and
unwrapped
the
paper
wound
around
it
.
<EOS>
“
Let
us
see
what
he
has
to
say
.
<EOS>
”The
paper
being
unfolded
,
showed
the
following
words
in
the
small
but
graceful
hand
of
the
Shawanoe:“Let
my
brothers
listen
!
<EOS>
They
will
hear
one
gun
;
they
will
hear
another
,
and
then
will
sound
a
third
!
<EOS>
Let
them
listen
closer
,
for
they
are
meant
for
their
ears
!
<EOS>
Then
will
come
shouts
and
the
sound
of
a
gun
the
fourth
time
!
<EOS>
Let
my
brothers
climb
over
the
logs
and
run
as
fast
as
they
can
to
the
river
.
<EOS>
Close
by
the
ash
that
lies
with
its
limbs
in
the
water
,
they
will
find
the
canoe
;
they
must
make
haste
to
paddle
across
or
it
will
be
too
late
.
<EOS>
They
must
not
wait
for
Deerfoot
.
<EOS>
He
will
take
care
of
himself
.
<EOS>
Let
my
brothers
listen
and
be
not
slow
.
<EOS>
”“There
's
no
trouble
to
understand
what
he
means
,
”
said
Jack
,
after
reading
the
words
aloud
.
<EOS>
“What
<EOS>
ish
<EOS>
it
dot
he
does
?
”
<EOS>
asked
Otto
,
not
quite
certain
as
to
the
purpose
of
their
dusky
ally
.
<EOS>
“He
means
to
start
a
panic
.
<EOS>
He
is
going
to
try
to
scare
the
red
men
so
that
they
will
scatter
and
give
us
a
chance
to
get
away
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
German
lad
shook
his
bead
.
<EOS>
“Nix
.
<EOS>
He
ca
n't
do
dot
.
”“It
<EOS>
looks
to
me
like
a
wild
scheme
,
but
as
it
is
the
last
hope
,
we
must
be
ready
to
give
all
the
help
we
can
,
<EOS>
for
I
do
n't
know
of
any
one
who
ought
to
be
more
interested
than
we
.
<EOS>
Sh
!
<EOS>
What
was
that?”Just
then
it
was
so
still
that
the
slightest
noise
made
by
a
falling
fragment
of
a
stick
reached
their
ears
.
<EOS>
Looking
quickly
around
they
saw
that
the
bit
of
wood
which
had
been
used
to
close
the
orifice
between
the
logs
had
fallen
or
had
been
pushed
out
and
lay
on
the
ground
.
<EOS>
The
narrow
slit
would
have
shown
daylight
through
it
<EOS>
had
it
not
been
closed
by
altogether
a
different
object
or
rather
series
of
objects
;
for
when
the
astonished
boys
contemplated
the
spot
they
caught
the
gleam
of
two
pairs
of
eyes
peering
at
them
.
<EOS>
The
Indians
had
found
the
opening
and
were
scrutinizing
the
interior
.
<EOS>
The
glitter
of
the
four
orbs
which
filled
the
crevice
caused
most
peculiar
sensations
on
the
part
of
the
boys
who
saw
them
.
<EOS>
“Ain't
<EOS>
you
not
ashamed
mit
yourselves
!
”
<EOS>
exclaimed
Otto
,
quickly
bringing
his
gun
to
his
shoulder
and
firing
directly
through
the
opening
.
<EOS>
“I
teaches
you
mit
better
manners
.
<EOS>
”But
,
quick
as
he
was
,
the
warriors
were
quicker
,
and
the
darkened
slit
became
light
with
the
noiseless
speed
of
a
twinkling
sunbeam
.
<EOS>
The
Indians
needed
no
second
intimation
of
what
was
coming
.
<EOS>
The
crisis
which
followed
this
shot
was
more
imminent
than
the
defenders
supposed
.
<EOS>
The
assailants
had
become
convinced
that
they
were
throwing
away
valuable
time
,
and
they
assembled
in
a
group
to
consider
the
best
means
of
forcing
matters
to
an
issue
.
<EOS>
It
was
at
that
moment
that
the
report
of
the
gun
was
heard
from
the
direction
of
the
river
.
<EOS>
Shawanoe
and
Miami
suspended
conversation
and
,
looking
inquiringly
at
each
other
,
listened
.
<EOS>
A
brief
while
after
,
the
second
shot
was
heard
from
another
point
,
followed
by
a
third
from
still
another
direction
.
<EOS>
“There
are
strangers
in
the
woods
,
”
remarked
one
of
the
warriors
,
in
a
guarded
voice
.
<EOS>
“Our
<EOS>
brothers
have
come
to
look
for
us
.
<EOS>
”As
<EOS>
suddenly
as
the
crash
of
a
thunderbolt
,
the
Shawanoe
war
-
whoop
broke
on
the
air
,
followed
by
what
seemed
to
be
the
shouts
of
white
men
.
<EOS>
Then
a
voice
of
mortal
terror
shouted
in
the
same
tongue:“The
white
men
are
coming
!
<EOS>
The
white
men
are
<EOS>
coming!”The
sound
of
hurrying
feet
was
heard
,
as
though
a
dozen
warriors
were
fleeing
in
hot
haste
from
a
dreaded
foe
.
<EOS>
The
effect
intended
by
this
diversion
of
Deerfoot
promised
the
brilliant
success
he
hoped
rather
than
expected
.
<EOS>
One
of
the
savages
standing
close
to
the
fallen
tree
,
started
with
an
exclamation
and
dashed
off
in
an
opposite
direction
from
the
point
whence
came
the
alarming
sounds
.
<EOS>
The
effect
was
contagious
:
the
others
followed
pell
-
mell
,
every
one
plunging
forward
with
the
frantic
desperation
which
the
bravest
man
will
show
in
moments
of
panic
.
<EOS>
It
need
not
be
said
that
Jack
Carleton
and
Otto
Relstaub
listened
to
these
favorable
sounds
with
breathless
interest
.
<EOS>
They
understood
the
stratagem
of
Deerfoot
,
and
could
not
feel
very
hopeful
of
its
success
;
but
the
noise
of
hastily
departing
warriors
thrilled
them
with
delight
.
<EOS>
“They
are
running
!
”
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
young
Kentuckian
,
with
beaming
face
;
“
who
would
have
thought
it?”“I
dinks
it
time
<EOS>
dot
<EOS>
we
vasn't
<EOS>
doing
the
same
,
”
said
Otto
,
who
,
catching
the
top
of
the
wall
with
both
hands
,
drew
himself
upward
and
peered
over
.
<EOS>
He
was
gratified
with
the
sight
of
the
two
hindmost
warriors
just
vanishing
from
sight
.
<EOS>
The
whole
party
were
panic
-
stricken
.
<EOS>
Otto
turned
his
head
to
tell
the
joyful
news
to
his
companion
,
when
he
saw
that
he
had
also
drawn
himself
up
beside
him
.
<EOS>
The
fourth
report
of
a
gun
was
heard
.
<EOS>
“Now
is
your
time
,
”
said
Jack
:
“
over
with
you
;
I
'll
hand
you
your
gun
.
<EOS>
”Otto
<EOS>
lost
no
time
in
scrambling
over
,
and
his
feet
scarcely
touched
the
ground
when
his
rifle
whizzed
end
over
end
after
him
.
<EOS>
It
required
all
his
activity
to
dodge
it
,
and
,
while
doing
so
,
he
received
a
sound
thump
from
the
gun
of
his
friend
,
who
seemed
to
be
flinging
weapons
around
with
wild
recklessness
.
<EOS>
One
important
fact
was
clear
to
the
boys
:
the
panic
of
the
Indians
was
certain
to
be
short
-
lived
.
<EOS>
Before
fleeing
far
,
they
would
suspect
the
trick
played
on
them
,
and
would
return
with
tenfold
more
fierceness
than
before
.
<EOS>
The
hearts
of
the
boys
throbbed
high
with
hope
when
they
found
themselves
outside
the
enclosure
which
had
served
them
as
a
prison
,
and
they
knew
the
irrevocable
step
had
been
taken
;
they
must
now
go
forward
at
all
hazards
.
<EOS>
The
Mississippi
was
near
,
and
thither
they
made
all
haste
,
remembering
the
instructions
of
Deerfoot
as
conveyed
through
the
note
<EOS>
borne
to
them
on
the
wings
of
the
arrow
.
<EOS>
Jack
,
who
was
the
fleeter
of
foot
,
kept
slightly
in
advance
,
though
he
had
no
purpose
of
leaving
his
friend
behind
.
<EOS>
“Dot
ish
one
good
things
as
nefer
vos
,
”
Otto
took
occasion
to
say
,
while
panting
close
behind
him
:
“
<EOS>
dere
ish
not
so
many
of
demi
blagued
vines
<EOS>
dot
cotches
me
<EOS>
all
de
times
<EOS>
ven
<EOS>
I
vos
—
<EOS>
oh
mine
gracious!”As
is
too
often
the
case
,
<EOS>
the
lad
rejoiced
too
soon
,
for
the
words
were
yet
in
his
mouth
when
the
very
mishap
he
referred
to
overtook
him
.
<EOS>
A
running
vine
became
entangled
around
his
ankles
,
and
he
went
forward
on
his
hands
and
knees
;
but
he
was
not
injured
,
and
speedily
rose
again
.
<EOS>
In
spite
of
their
imminent
peril
,
the
young
Kentuckian
could
not
repress
a
smile
when
he
glanced
back
and
saw
Otto
picking
himself
up
;
but
the
smile
was
gone
instantly
,
for
the
situation
<EOS>
was
anything
but
a
mirthful
one
.
<EOS>
“Here
we
are
!
”
<EOS>
called
out
Jack
,
halting
on
the
bank
of
the
river
and
glancing
around
him
.
<EOS>
“
But
where
is
the
canoe?”“I
dinks
the
first
things
ish
to
find
the
ash
tree
what
ish
not
laying
up
but
standing
down
,
”
suggested
Otto
,
moving
along
the
stream
.
<EOS>
It
was
manifest
that
the
boat
could
not
be
found
until
after
locating
the
landmark
named
by
the
young
Shawanoe
;
for
it
was
certain
Deerfoot
had
taken
care
to
hide
the
canoe
where
some
search
would
be
necessary
to
find
it
.
<EOS>
But
in
specifying
the
fallen
tree
,
Deerfoot
gave
no
idea
of
where
it
was
to
be
found
.
<EOS>
He
must
have
believed
it
was
so
conspicuous
that
no
direction
was
required
.
<EOS>
During
the
few
seconds
that
the
friends
stood
irresolute
,
they
used
ears
as
well
as
eyes
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
the
whoop
of
an
Indian
was
heard
a
brief
distance
away
.
<EOS>
“My
gracious
!
”
<EOS>
whispered
Jack
;
“
they
're
coming
back
!
<EOS>
They
have
discovered
the
trick
.
<EOS>
”“Dot
<EOS>
ish
<EOS>
so
;
let
's
jump
on
to
de
water
and
swim
to
de
oder
side
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
situation
was
enough
to
make
the
bravest
nervous
,
and
the
sturdy
German
could
not
repress
his
impatience
.
<EOS>
Every
second
was
of
incalculable
worth
,
and
yet
,
knowing
they
were
close
to
the
means
which
was
to
take
them
to
safety
,
they
could
not
seize
it
.
<EOS>
“No
;
that
wo
n't
do
<EOS>
,
”
replied
Jack
,
resolutely
;
they
will
stand
on
the
bank
and
pick
us
off
without
trouble
to
themselves
;
we
must
find
the
boat
.
<EOS>
”“But
<EOS>
how
ca
n't
we
do
<EOS>
dot?”“You
move
up
the
bank
<EOS>
and
I
will
hurry
down
it
<EOS>
the
canoe
can
not
be
far
off
;
the
instant
you
catch
sight
of
it
,
whistle
,
and
<EOS>
I
'll
do
the
same
if
I
see
it
before
you
.
<EOS>
”Otto
<EOS>
sprang
away
with
a
more
anxious
expression
on
his
broad
,
honest
face
than
it
wore
when
he
was
crouching
behind
the
logs
,
and
the
young
Kentuckian
was
scarcely
less
agitated
.
<EOS>
His
feelings
were
similar
to
those
which
come
to
us
in
sleep
,
when
we
see
some
grisly
terror
approaching
and
have
no
power
to
flee
before
it
.
<EOS>
Somewhere
,
almost
within
reach
,
was
the
vehicle
to
carry
them
out
of
peril
,
and
yet
they
could
not
lay
their
hands
on
it
.
<EOS>
Jack
was
resolved
,
in
case
the
canoe
was
not
speedily
found
,
to
do
as
Otto
advised
—
leap
into
the
Mississippi
and
swim
boldly
for
the
other
shore
.
<EOS>
If
they
could
gain
a
fair
start
,
they
would
have
cause
to
hope
;
but
such
an
attempt
,
desperate
as
it
was
,
must
be
undertaken
very
soon
or
not
at
all
.
<EOS>
Again
the
dreaded
whoop
reached
them
from
the
woods
,
and
the
leader
started
as
though
he
had
caught
the
click
of
a
gun
-
lock
from
behind
a
tree
.
<EOS>
The
cry
was
not
a
loud
one
,
and
was
no
doubt
meant
as
a
signal
to
some
one
not
far
off
.
<EOS>
“I
wonder
where
Deerfoot
can
be
,
”
muttered
Jack
,
pushing
his
way
hurriedly
through
the
underbrush
,
and
glancing
in
every
direction
for
the
fallen
tree
which
was
to
show
them
the
craft
.
<EOS>
“
He
told
us
not
to
wait
for
him
,
but
it
seems
to
me
he
ought
to
have
given
us
help
in
finding
the
boat
.
<EOS>
”Again
,
and
for
the
third
time
,
the
frightful
signal
trembled
among
the
trees
close
behind
him
.
<EOS>
“He
<EOS>
sha
n't
catch
me
unprepared
,
at
any
rate
,
”
muttered
the
young
Kentuckian
,
raising
the
hammer
of
his
gun
and
looking
defiantly
toward
the
point
whence
came
the
cry
.
<EOS>
The
Indian
did
not
show
himself
,
and
conscious
that
he
was
throwing
away
precious
seconds
,
Jack
pushed
forward
once
more
,
keeping
watch
of
his
flank
as
well
as
his
front
,
for
a
treacherous
shot
from
the
forest
would
render
a
canoe
altogether
useless
,
so
far
,
at
least
,
as
Master
Jack
Carleton
was
concerned
.
<EOS>
He
was
impatient
and
desperate
.
<EOS>
There
is
often
a
perverseness
in
inanimate
things
which
is
beyond
endurance
.
<EOS>
He
had
started
with
the
highest
hopes
a
few
minutes
before
,
confident
of
finding
the
Indian
canoe
without
trouble
,
and
now
he
was
baffled
and
held
back
when
on
the
very
threshold
of
safety
.
<EOS>
“It
is
useless
to
wait
,
”
he
finally
said
,
coming
to
an
abrupt
halt
.
<EOS>
“
I
will
call
to
Otto
and
we
will
swim
for
it
.
<EOS>
”But
,
before
he
could
emit
the
whistle
that
had
been
agreed
upon
,
his
ears
were
set
tingling
by
the
identical
signal
coming
from
a
point
up
the
bank
.
<EOS>
“Thank
heaven
!
”
<EOS>
was
his
exclamation
,
as
he
wheeled
about
and
,
forgetful
of
the
other
signal
that
had
told
him
of
peril
,
dashed
along
the
bank
of
the
stream
with
furious
haste
.
<EOS>
“Otto
has
been
more
fortunate
than
I
,
”
he
added
,
as
he
bounded
forward
;
“
he
has
found
the
canoe
,
and
I
pray
that
he
has
not
been
too
late
for
us
to
use
it
.
<EOS>
”CHAPTER

XVI

<EOS>
ON
THE
RIVERThe
experience
of
Otto
was
somewhat
similar
to
that
which
befell
Jack
Carleton
in
his
search
for
the
Indian
canoe
.
<EOS>
Strong
,
self
-
possessed
,
and
courageous
by
nature
as
was
the
German
lad
,
he
fretted
over
his
forced
restraint
more
than
did
the
other
.
<EOS>
He
pushed
forward
with
grim
recklessness
.
<EOS>
He
caught
the
signal
of
the
warrior
which
caused
Jack
so
much
disquiet
,
but
he
did
not
permit
it
to
interfere
with
his
purpose
.
<EOS>
“Let
<EOS>
him
<EOS>
boot
<EOS>
all
dot
<EOS>
he
does
n't
vant
to
,
”
muttered
the
angry
lad
;
“
he
do
n't
drive
me
away
from
looking
for
dot
canoe
,
do
n't
it?”Several
minutes
passed
,
during
which
he
failed
to
discover
the
first
sign
of
the
missing
boat
.
<EOS>
Finally
,
realizing
that
a
considerable
distance
must
intervene
between
him
and
Jack
,
he
came
to
a
pause
,
and
,
sitting
on
a
fallen
tree
,
took
off
his
cap
,
mopped
his
forehead
,
and
heaved
a
great
sigh:“Dot
ish
queerer
as
efer
vos
;
<EOS>
Deerfoot
,
he
tells
me
dot
<EOS>
we
find
his
boat
<EOS>
and
we
do
n't
finds
him
;
he
says
we
must
jump
into
the
boat
and
paddles
out
mitdle
Mississippi
,
but
we
finds
the
Mississippi
,
but
vere
ai
n't
dot
canoe
?
<EOS>
Dot
ishn't
the
question
.
<EOS>
Vere
is
n't
Jack
?
<EOS>
He
ish
looking
for
de
canoe
also
mit
likevise
,
and
I
do
n't
bear
him
vistle
for
me
—
<EOS>
mine
gracious!”Otto
spoke
slowly
,
giving
utterance
only
to
a
few
of
the
thoughts
which
stirred
his
brain
.
<EOS>
He
was
on
the
point
of
signaling
to
his
friend
to
return
,
and
,
insisting
that
they
should
swim
the
river
together
,
when
he
became
aware
that
the
undergrowth
in
front
of
him
and
close
to
the
water
,
partially
screened
some
object
whose
outlines
could
be
faintly
trace
from
where
he
sat
.
<EOS>
With
the
exclamation
,
he
straightened
up
and
stared
in
blank
astonishment
.
<EOS>
The
contour
of
what
he
saw
was
so
distinct
that
there
could
be
no
mistake
;
he
was
staring
straight
at
the
canoe
for
which
he
had
been
hunting
so
long
.
<EOS>
Otto
softly
rose
to
his
feet
and
looked
behind
him
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
sitting
on
the
very
ash
which
Deerfoot
had
named
as
the
guide
that
would
direct
them
in
finding
the
craft
.
<EOS>
Otto
threw
back
his
head
and
laughed
,
overcome
by
the
reaction
from
the
tense
strain
to
which
his
nerves
had
been
subjected
.
<EOS>
“Ven
somepody
axes
for
de
biggest
fool
<EOS>
dot
efer
vos
<EOS>
,
he
looks
at
Otto
Relstaub
and
says
,
'
I
Dot
ish
him
,
'
and
dot
will
be
him
.
<EOS>
”But
<EOS>
he
,
shivered
at
the
thought
of
the
minutes
that
had
slipped
by
,
and
,
without
indulging
in
any
more
soliloquy
,
placed
his
finger
and
thumb
in
his
mouth
and
emitted
the
whistle
which
thrilled
Jack
Carleton
down
the
river
and
brought
him
hurrying
to
the
spot
.
<EOS>
Satisfied
that
no
repetition
of
the
call
was
required
,
Otto
gave
his
attention
to
the
boat
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
fine
Indian
canoe
,
buoyant
enough
to
carry
six
or
eight
warriors
,
and
furnished
with
three
long
paddles
which
,
in
skillful
hands
,
could
drive
it
with
great
speed
through
the
water
.
<EOS>
It
was
made
of
bark
,
bow
and
stern
being
similar
,
curving
inward
toward
the
middle
of
the
boat
,
and
painted
with
rude
designs
outside
,
which
showed
more
taste
than
did
the
ornamentation
of
the
aboriginal
countenances
.
<EOS>
Deerfoot
had
displayed
no
little
ingenuity
in
screening
the
craft
from
sight
.
<EOS>
Inasmuch
as
Otto
had
forgotten
himself
so
far
as
to
sit
down
on
the
very
tree
for
which
he
was
searching
without
once
suspecting
his
forgetfulness
,
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
he
would
have
discovered
the
boat
at
all
but
for
the
accident
named
.
<EOS>
Grasping
one
end
,
he
began
vigorously
pushing
it
into
the
current
.
<EOS>
It
was
heavy
,
and
he
wondered
at
the
strength
of
the
young
Shawanoe
,
who
had
drawn
it
clear
of
the
water
,
overlooking
the
fact
that
moderate
strength
,
skillfully
applied
,
succeeds
more
frequently
than
does
simple
physical
power
.
<EOS>
After
much
effort
,
he
shoved
it
clear
of
the
land
and
held
it
floating
on
the
surface
.
<EOS>
“I
wonder
if
Jack
did
n't
hear
me
<EOS>
,
”
he
thought
,
looking
around
;
“
I
thinks
I
calls
him
agin
once
more
.
”He
<EOS>
did
not
utter
the
signal
,
however
,
for
<EOS>
just
then
he
heard
approaching
footsteps
,
and
,
a
minute
later
,
the
flushed
and
panting
Jack
Carleton
was
beside
him
.
<EOS>
“Thank
heaven
!
”
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
;
“
I
was
in
despair
when
your
signal
reached
me
;
we
have
n't
a
second
to
lose
.
<EOS>
”“We
<EOS>
ishet
going
to
lose
him
,
not
at
all
.
<EOS>
Hark!”They
heard
just
then
,
not
only
the
faint
whoop
that
had
caused
them
so
much
disquiet
,
but
caught
sight
of
the
warrior
who
uttered
the
alarming
call
.
<EOS>
He
whisked
between
the
trees
with
such
bewildering
quickness
of
movement
that
Jack
,
who
had
turned
with
his
rifle
half
raised
,
saw
no
chance
of
firing
with
effect
.
<EOS>
Fortunately
,
the
necessity
for
doing
so
did
not
exist
,
for
the
boys
at
the
same
moment
recognized
the
red
man
as
their
friend
Deerfoot
,
who
walked
forward
smiling
and
pleased
,
carrying
his
bow
and
gun
.
<EOS>
“My
<EOS>
brothers
did
well
,
”
he
said
in
his
quiet
way
;
“
<EOS>
but
they
did
not
hasten
as
does
the
deer
when
the
hounds
are
on
his
trail
.
<EOS>
”“We
<EOS>
could
not
have
hurried
more
than
we
did
,
”
replied
Jack
Carleton
,
taking
the
hand
of
the
youthful
warrior
;
“
a
little
more
haste
and
both
of
us
would
have
broken
our
necks
.
<EOS>
”“Dot
<EOS>
ish
<EOS>
so
,
”
added
Otto
,
emphatically
;
<EOS>
“
I
sot
down
on
dis
log
to
dinks
if
I
could
n't
run
fitstery
<EOS>
but
I
could
n't
.
<EOS>
What
for
you
keep
whooping
all
the
time
like
a
crazy
person?”“Deerfoot
wished
to
see
his
brothers
run
,
for
the
red
men
are
looking
for
them
.
<EOS>
”“I've
<EOS>
no
doubt
of
that
,
and
the
wonder
to
me
is
how
you
managed
to
give
them
such
a
scare
that
they
scattered
and
left
us
a
chance
to
dig
out
.
<EOS>
”“The
wicked
flee
when
no
man
pursueth
,
”
was
the
apt
quotation
of
the
extraordinary
youth
,
who
was
so
fond
of
studying
his
Bible
.
<EOS>
“
But
their
fright
will
not
last
long
.
”“Such
<EOS>
being
the
case
we
must
not
tarry
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
Shawanoe
acted
as
though
he
did
not
intend
to
enter
the
canoe
with
them
,
seemingly
having
some
object
in
remaining
on
the
Kentucky
side
;
but
he
changed
his
mind
,
probably
concluding
that
his
services
were
still
needed
by
his
friends
.
<EOS>
He
motioned
to
Jack
,
who
stepped
into
the
boat
and
picked
up
one
of
the
paddles
,
Otto
having
done
the
same
.
<EOS>
Deerfoot
leaped
lightly
after
them
,
the
impulse
carrying
the
craft
fully
a
rod
from
shore
.
<EOS>
He
laid
down
his
gun
and
bow
,
and
,
seizing
the
third
paddle
,
made
such
a
powerful
sweep
through
the
water
that
the
others
almost
lost
their
balance
.
<EOS>
They
essayed
to
help
him
,
but
he
asked
them
with
a
smile
to
cease
and
leave
the
management
of
the
boat
entirely
to
him
.
<EOS>
“We
<EOS>
might
as
well
,
”
said
Jack
,
“
for
we
shall
only
hinder
you
.
<EOS>
”“Dot
<EOS>
ish
de
same
as
I
does
n't
dinks
.
<EOS>
”A
<EOS>
few
strokes
sent
the
canoe
well
out
from
the
land
,
and
the
Shawanoe
still
plied
the
paddle
with
extraordinary
skill
;
but
,
as
he
left
the
shore
,
he
knew
that
in
one
respect
the
danger
of
himself
and
companions
was
increased
.
<EOS>
If
their
enemies
were
anywhere
along
the
Mississippi
,
with
a
suspicion
of
the
truth
,
they
could
not
fail
to
detect
them
.
<EOS>
It
proved
as
he
suspected
.
<EOS>
Several
whoops
echoed
from
a
point
a
short
distance
below
,
and
the
quick
eye
of
the
leader
caught
sight
of
the
Miamis
and
Shawanoes
on
the
bank
.
<EOS>
“Down
!
<EOS>
Down
!
”
<EOS>
he
said
,
excitedly
;
“
let
my
brothers
lower
their
heads
or
they
will
be
killed
.
<EOS>
”Both
<EOS>
Jack
and
Otto
extended
themselves
flat
on
the
bottom
of
the
boat
,
but
Deerfoot
remained
upright
,
plying
the
paddle
with
might
and
main
.
<EOS>
He
headed
out
in
the
stream
,
and
used
every
effort
to
get
beyond
reach
of
the
rifles
of
his
enemies
.
<EOS>
“Why
<EOS>
do
n't
you
duck
your
head
,
too
?
”
<EOS>
demanded
the
alarmed
Jack
;
“
they
can
hit
you
as
easily
as
us
.
<EOS>
”But
<EOS>
Deerfoot
had
his
eyes
on
the
party
and
did
not
mean
to
throw
away
his
life
.
<EOS>
He
saw
there
were
four
red
men
who
stood
together
on
the
very
edge
of
the
wood
.
<EOS>
When
two
of
them
raised
their
guns
and
sighted
at
him
,
he
dropped
like
the
loon
,
which
dodges
the
bullet
of
the
hunter
by
the
flash
of
his
gun
.
<EOS>
A
couple
of
reports
sounded
like
one
,
and
the
three
on
the
bottom
of
the
canoe
heard
the
bark
fly
.
<EOS>
Both
balls
had
pierced
it
,
entering
one
side
and
passing
out
on
the
other
.
<EOS>
The
weight
of
the
occupants
caused
the
boat
to
sink
sufficiently
to
protect
them
,
so
long
as
they
remained
flat
on
the
bottom
.
<EOS>
One
of
the
bullets
was
aimed
so
low
that
it
struck
the
water
,
ricocheting
through
the
bark
and
bounding
off
in
space
.
<EOS>
The
other
went
within
an
inch
of
Deerfoot
's
figure
,
he
being
slightly
higher
than
either
of
the
others
.
<EOS>
The
echoes
of
the
guns
were
ringing
through
the
wood
,
when
the
Shawanoe
straightened
up
and
dipped
the
paddle
into
the
waters
again
;
but
he
had
time
for
only
one
sweeping
stroke
when
down
he
went
once
more
,
barely
in
time
to
escape
the
third
shot
.
<EOS>
Before
using
the
paddles
,
he
raised
his
head
just
enough
to
peep
over
the
gunwale
.
<EOS>
He
saw
the
three
warriors
deliberately
reloading
their
weapons
,
while
the
other
was
waiting
for
his
target
to
present
itself
.
<EOS>
There
were
two
others
,
who
had
been
drawn
thither
by
the
calls
of
the
first
party
.
<EOS>
“I
<EOS>
dinks
<EOS>
maybe
I
can
does
somedings
to
help
,
”
said
Otto
,
timidly
looking
over
the
side
of
the
craft
;
“
mebbe
I
sees
—
mine
gracious!”The
gun
which
was
fired
just
then
sent
the
bullet
,
as
may
be
said
,
directly
under
the
nose
of
the
German
,
who
lowered
his
face
with
such
quickness
that
the
whole
boat
jarred
from
the
bump
against
the
bottom
.
<EOS>
“Deerfoot
,
wo
n't
it
be
a
good
thing
to
send
a
shot
at
them
?
”
<EOS>
asked
Jack
;
“
it
seems
to
me
they
would
not
be
quite
so
ready
with
their
guns
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
Shawanoe
was
evidently
of
the
same
mind
.
<EOS>
He
had
the
choice
of
two
weapons
,
and
need
it
be
said
which
was
the
one
selected?Standing
erect
in
the
canoe
,
he
fitted
an
arrow
to
the
string
with
incredible
dexterity
and
launched
it
with
a
speed
that
rendered
it
almost
invisible
.
<EOS>
The
distance
caused
him
to
elevate
the
missile
slightly
,
but
the
aim
of
Simon
Kenton
or
Daniel
Boone
,
with
his
long
,
trusty
rifle
,
could
not
have
been
more
unerring
.
<EOS>
The
red
men
on
shore
were
well
aware
of
his
amazing
skill
,
and
they
lost
no
time
in
adopting
the
dodging
tactics
.
<EOS>
The
instant
the
form
of
the
graceful
young
warrior
was
thrown
in
relief
against
the
sky
and
wooded
shore
,
they
bounded
behind
the
nearest
trees
,
peering
forth
like
frightened
children
.
<EOS>
The
movement
saved
one
life
at
least
,
for
the
winged
missile
which
,
a
second
later
,
whizzed
over
the
spot
where
they
had
been
standing
,
was
driven
with
a
force
that
would
have
caused
it
to
plunge
clean
through
the
body
of
any
one
in
its
path
.
<EOS>
Deerfoot
remained
erect
in
the
canoe
until
the
shaft
had
landed
,
when
he
gave
utterance
to
a
defiant
shout
;
sat
down
,
and
deliberately
took
up
the
paddle
again
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
borne
in
mind
that
the
yellow
current
of
the
Mississippi
was
swollen
by
freshets
near
its
headwaters
,
and
the
canoe
not
only
danced
about
a
great
deal
,
but
was
borne
swiftly
downward
,
seeing
which
the
Indians
hastened
in
a
parallel
course
,
with
the
purpose
of
holding
it
within
range
.
<EOS>
Furthermore
,
other
red
men
continually
appeared
at
a
lower
point
.
<EOS>
It
is
within
bounds
to
say
that
there
was
not
one
who
did
not
understand
the
stratagem
by
which
the
young
Shawanoe
had
outwitted
them
,
and
there
was
no
means
within
their
reach
which
they
would
not
have
put
forth
to
revenge
themselves
upon
him
.
<EOS>
Within
a
brief
space
of
time
the
guns
of
the
warriors
began
popping
from
so
many
different
points
that
Deerfoot
dare
not
attempt
to
use
the
paddle
.
<EOS>
The
blue
puffs
of
smoke
were
so
near
that
it
would
have
been
fatal
to
expose
himself
to
the
aim
of
his
enemies
,
but
,
unless
the
canoe
could
be
propelled
still
further
from
them
,
it
was
likely
to
be
riddled
by
the
converging
fires
.
<EOS>
“Things
are
in
a
bad
shape
,
”
remarked
Jack
Carleton
,
afraid
to
raise
his
head
a
single
inch
,
for
the
boat
rode
most
uncomfortably
high
;
“
we
must
do
something
,
and
yet
what
can
we
do?”Deerfoot
made
no
answer
;
his
fertile
brain
had
extricated
other
parties
from
more
critical
situations
than
the
one
in
which
he
was
now
placed
,
and
he
was
quick
to
decide
upon
an
expedient
for
doing
the
same
in
the
present
instance
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
XVII
.
<EOS>
THE
LOUISIANA
SHOREDeerfoot
threw
himself
over
the
side
of
the
canoe
into
the
river
,
holding
fast
to
the
gunwale
with
one
hand
and
keeping
the
boat
between
him
and
the
Indians
on
shore
.
<EOS>
With
the
arm
which
was
free
,
he
swam
toward
the
Louisiana
side
,
towing
the
craft
after
him
.
<EOS>
While
it
seemed
absolutely
necessary
that
something
of
the
kind
should
be
done
,
yet
the
reader
will
perceive
that
the
course
of
the
Shawanoe
was
extremely
perilous
,
not
only
for
himself
,
but
for
his
friends
whom
he
was
so
anxious
to
benefit
.
<EOS>
His
removal
from
the
canoe
caused
it
to
ride
higher
,
and
thereby
exposed
them
to
the
bullets
that
were
continually
skipping
about
it
.
<EOS>
Deerfoot
himself
was
forced
to
keep
his
shoulders
at
such
an
elevation
that
he
was
liable
to
be
perforated
by
some
flying
missiles
,
but
he
increased
the
distance
between
himself
and
enemies
with
greater
speed
than
would
be
supposed
.
<EOS>
“I
dinks
dis
ish
good
style
,
”
said
Otto
to
Jack
,
who
moved
his
head
so
as
to
see
what
he
was
doing
.
<EOS>
The
sagacious
German
had
gathered
the
three
paddles
<EOS>
so
they
were
added
to
that
side
of
the
craft
which
served
as
a
partial
shield
against
the
shots
from
the
shore
.
<EOS>
The
implements
were
so
arranged
that
the
lad
felt
safe
against
harm
,
unless
the
boat
should
turn
half
way
round
before
he
could
accommodate
himself
to
the
changed
condition
of
things
.
<EOS>
“It
<EOS>
is
a
good
idea
,
”
said
Jack
,
admiringly
,
as
he
hastened
to
avail
himself
of
the
defense
;
“
I
do
n't
believe
one
of
their
bullets
can
pierce
our
shield
.
<EOS>
”Something
<EOS>
cold
made
itself
felt
through
the
clothing
of
the
young
Kentuckian
,
where
his
hip
pressed
the
bottom
of
the
canoe
.
<EOS>
Groping
with
his
hand
he
found
it
was
water
,
which
he
saw
bubbling
through
a
bullet
-
hole
that
was
forced
below
the
surface
by
the
vigor
of
Deerfoot
's
arm
.
<EOS>
The
opposite
side
of
the
boat
was
lifted
correspondingly
high
,
so
that
the
sunlight
shone
through
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
understood
that
the
conditions
prevented
the
Shawanoe
from
towing
the
boat
directly
across
the
Mississippi
.
<EOS>
The
swift
current
rendered
a
diagonal
course
necessary
,
and
even
that
could
not
be
pushed
with
enough
power
to
prevent
the
party
drifting
down
stream
.
<EOS>
The
red
men
kept
up
a
desultory
fire
,
but
it
was
less
frequent
and
manifestly
less
hopeful
than
at
first
.
<EOS>
They
could
not
but
see
that
the
craft
was
steadily
passing
beyond
range
,
and
the
chances
of
inflicting
injury
grew
less
every
moment
.
<EOS>
Soon
the
firing
ceased
altogether
.
<EOS>
A
moment
later
,
the
dripping
form
of
Deerfoot
flipped
over
the
gunwale
again
,
diffusing
moisture
in
every
direction
.
<EOS>
Without
a
word
,
he
seized
the
paddle
and
plied
it
with
his
old
-
time
skill
and
vigor
.
<EOS>
He
looked
keenly
toward
Kentucky
,
but
saw
nothing
of
his
enemies
:
they
must
have
concluded
to
withdraw
and
bestow
their
attention
elsewhere
.
<EOS>
But
,
convinced
that
they
were
still
watching
the
course
of
the
canoe
,
he
again
rose
to
his
feet
,
and
,
circling
the
paddle
over
his
head
,
gave
utterance
to
a
number
of
tantalizing
whoops
.
<EOS>
His
enemies
had
been
outwitted
with
such
cleverness
that
the
youth
could
not
deny
himself
the
pleasure
of
expressing
his
exultation
in
that
characteristic
fashion
.
<EOS>
When
Jack
Carleton
discovered
the
water
bubbling
through
the
bullet
-
hole
in
the
side
of
the
canoe
,
as
though
it
was
a
tiny
spring
that
had
just
burst
forth
,
he
was
afraid
it
would
sink
the
craft
.
<EOS>
He
inserted
the
end
of
his
finger
to
check
,
in
some
measure
,
the
flow
;
but
Deerfoot
,
observing
the
act
,
shook
his
head
to
signify
it
was
unnecessary
.
<EOS>
“My
brothers
shall
reach
land
,
”
he
said
.
<EOS>
“I
have
no
doubt
we
shall
,
since
you
are
using
the
paddle
again
,
but
a
little
while
ago
it
looked
as
though
the
land
we
were
going
to
reach
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
river
.
<EOS>
Deerfoot
,
”
added
Jack
,
with
a
smile
,
“
they
have
punctured
this
boat
pretty
thoroughly
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
understand
how
it
was
we
all
escaped
when
the
bullets
seemed
to
be
everywhere
.
<EOS>
”“The
Great
Spirit
turned
aside
the
bullets
,
”
said
the
Shawanoe
.
<EOS>
“No
<EOS>
he
did
n't
,
”
was
the
sturdy
response
of
Jack
;
“
I
acknowledge
His
mercies
,
which
have
followed
us
all
the
days
of
our
lives
,
but
that
is
not
the
way
He
works
.
<EOS>
You
know
as
well
as
do
I
,
that
if
yon
get
in
the
way
of
a
Shawanoe
or
Miami
rifle
,
you
will
be
hit
unless
yon
are
very
quick
to
get
out
of
the
way
again
;
but
for
all
that
,
”
the
Kentuckian
hastened
to
add
,
noticing
a
reproving
expression
on
the
countenance
of
his
dusky
friend
,
“
my
heart
overflows
with
gratitude
because
we
have
been
saved
,
when
there
seemed
not
the
first
ray
of
hope
for
us
.
<EOS>
The
bullets
came
near
,
but
none
touched
us
.
<EOS>
”“I
<EOS>
dinks
different
,
”
was
the
unexpected
remark
of
Otto
,
who
,
assuming
the
sitting
position
,
took
off
his
cap
,
and
,
after
fumbling
awhile
through
his
shock
of
yellow
hair
,
actually
found
a
ball
,
which
he
held
up
between
his
fingers
.
<EOS>
“Vot
<EOS>
do
n't
you
dinks
ob
him
,
eh
?
”
<EOS>
he
asked
,
triumphantly
.
<EOS>
The
amazed
Jack
took
the
object
and
examined
it
.
<EOS>
No
need
was
there
of
doing
so
;
it
was
a
rifle
ball
beyond
question
.
<EOS>
“How
<EOS>
in
the
name
of
all
that
's
wonderful
did
that
get
into
your
hair
?
”
<EOS>
asked
his
friend
.
<EOS>
“I
<EOS>
'
spose
he
was
shot
dere
,
and
my
head
was
too
hard
for
it
to
pass
through
,
so
he
stops
,
do
n't
it?”The
<EOS>
canoe
was
so
close
to
shore
that
Deerfoot
stopped
paddling
for
the
moment
and
extended
his
band
for
the
missile
.
<EOS>
He
simply
held
it
up
,
glanced
at
it
,
and
then
tossed
it
back
to
Otto
with
the
remark:“The
head
of
my
brother
<EOS>
is
thick
like
the
rock
,
but
the
ball
was
not
fired
from
a
gun
.
<EOS>
”With
<EOS>
a
bewildered
expression
,
as
though
some
forgotten
fact
was
beginning
to
dawn
upon
him
<EOS>
,
Otto
laid
his
cap
in
his
lap
and
began
searching
through
his
hair
with
both
hands
.
<EOS>
A
moment
later
,
his
face
beamed
with
one
of
his
most
expansive
smiles
,
and
he
showed
two
more
rifle
-
bullets
that
had
been
fished
from
the
capillary
depths
.
<EOS>
“Yaw
<EOS>
,
I
forgots
him
;
I
puts
dem
pullets
in
mine
hat
yesterday
and
I
dinks
dey
was
lost
;
dat
is
looky
,
ai
n't
it?”“I
<EOS>
do
n't
see
anything
particularly
lucky
about
it
,
”
said
Jack
,
who
suspected
that
much
of
the
lad
's
stupidity
was
assumed
.
<EOS>
A
healthy
youngster
never
fails
to
have
the
organ
of
mirth
well
forward
in
development
,
and
the
promptings
of
Otto
's
innate
love
of
fun
seemed
to
have
little
regard
for
time
,
place
or
circumstances
.
<EOS>
The
American
Indian
is
probably
the
most
melancholy
of
the
five
races
of
men
;
but
even
he
is
not
lacking
in
the
element
of
mirth
which
it
is
maintained
is
often
displayed
by
dumb
animals
.
<EOS>
When
Deerfoot
heard
the
explanation
of
Otto
,
he
did
not
smile
,
but
with
a
grave
expression
of
countenance
gave
his
entire
attention
to
the
paddle
in
his
hand
.
<EOS>
The
German
sat
with
his
back
toward
the
front
of
the
canoe
,
the
other
two
facing
him
,
the
Shawanoe
being
at
the
rear
.
<EOS>
The
shore
was
only
a
few
rods
away
,
the
Mississippi
being
much
less
agitated
at
the
side
than
in
the
middle
.
<EOS>
Without
any
display
of
effort
,
the
warrior
used
the
long
paddle
with
all
the
power
he
could
put
forth
.
<EOS>
Very
soon
the
craft
attained
a
speed
greater
than
either
of
the
pale
faces
suspected
.
<EOS>
“No
<EOS>
,
”
repeated
Jack
Carleton
,
“
I
ca
n't
see
where
there
is
any
special
luck
in
finding
the
bullets
in
your
hair
;
I
should
n't
be
surprised
if
they
had
been
there
for
a
week
.
<EOS>
You
must
use
a
very
coarse
-
toothed
comb
.
<EOS>
”“My
<EOS>
brother
uses
no
comb
at
all
,
”
suggested
Deerfoot
,
in
a
solemn
voice
,
from
the
rear
of
the
boat
,
which
was
speeding
like
an
arrow
over
the
water
.
<EOS>
“Now
you
have
struck
the
truth
,
”
laughed
Jack
.
<EOS>
Otto
rose
to
a
stooping
position
,
steadying
himself
as
best
he
could
,
and
extended
his
hand
to
shake
that
of
the
Shawanoe
,
as
proof
that
he
indorsed
his
remark
.
<EOS>
He
placed
a
hand
on
the
shoulder
of
the
Kentuckian
to
steady
himself
,
for
he
knew
that
it
is
a
difficult
matter
for
one
to
keep
his
balance
in
such
a
delicate
structure
as
an
Indian
canoe
.
<EOS>
“Deerfoot
ish
not
such
a
pig
fool
as
he
do
n't
look
to
be
<EOS>
,
somedimes
I
dinks
he
knows
more
nodins
dan
nopody
;
den
van
he
h'ists
sail
in
his
canoe
and
sails
off
mitout
saying
nodings
to
nopody
,
den
I
do
n't
dinks
.
<EOS>
”Otto
<EOS>
Relstaub
had
reached
that
point
in
his
remark
,
when
the
bow
of
the
canoe
arrived
in
Louisiana
.
<EOS>
It
struck
the
shore
with
a
violence
that
started
the
seams
through
the
entire
structure
.
<EOS>
The
author
of
all
this
of
course
kept
his
seat
,
for
he
had
braced
himself
for
the
shook
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
he
caught
the
shoulder
of
Jack
Carleton
,
as
if
to
hold
him
quiet
,
but
it
was
all
pretense
on
his
part
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
“
grip
”
to
his
fingers
,
and
Jack
immediately
plunged
forward
,
his
head
bumping
the
bottom
of
the
boat
with
a
crash
.
<EOS>
As
for
Otto
Relstaub
,
the
consequences
took
away
his
breath
.
<EOS>
As
he
was
trying
to
stand
on
his
feet
,
he
had
a
great
deal
more
of
falling
to
do
it
than
his
friend
.
<EOS>
He
did
it
most
thoroughly
,
sitting
down
with
such
emphasis
that
the
side
of
the
canoe
gave
way
,
and
he
continued
the
act
on
dry
land
,
being
stopped
by
a
small
sapling
in
his
path
.
<EOS>
Otto
whirled
over
on
his
face
,
and
scrambling
to
his
feet
,
stared
around
to
learn
the
extent
of
the
calamity
.
<EOS>
He
gathered
up
his
gun
and
hat
,
and
then
,
stooping
,
passed
his
hands
over
the
bark
and
attentively
examined
it
.
<EOS>
“I
<EOS>
dinks
it
<EOS>
ish
split
a
good
deal
mit
my
head
,
”
he
remarked
,
with
a
grave
countenance
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
Jack
Carleton
had
regained
his
upright
position
and
shaken
himself
together
.
<EOS>
When
he
saw
Otto
in
an
inverted
position
,
he
broke
into
hearty
laughter
,
hastened
,
no
doubt
,
by
the
fact
that
Deerfoot
was
shaking
from
head
to
foot
with
mirth
.
<EOS>
His
black
eyes
glistened
with
tears
,
caused
by
his
amusement
over
the
performance
of
the
German
.
<EOS>
He
was
laughing
all
over
,
though
he
gave
out
not
the
slightest
sound
.
<EOS>
As
for
Jack
Carleton
,
he
chuckled
and
gurgled
with
a
noise
like
that
of
water
running
out
of
a
bottle
,
while
the
main
victim
of
all
this
merriment
was
as
solemn
as
an
owl
.
<EOS>
After
rubbing
and
adjusting
himself
,
as
may
be
said
,
he
turned
slowly
about
and
gazed
inquiringly
at
his
friends
in
the
boat
,
as
if
puzzled
to
understand
the
cause
of
their
emotions
.
<EOS>
“Vot
<EOS>
ish
dot
<EOS>
you
seem
to
laugh
mit
?
”
<EOS>
he
demanded
,
in
an
injured
voice
;
“
I
see
nodings
.
<EOS>
”When
<EOS>
the
others
had
somewhat
recovered
from
their
mirth
,
Otto
began
laughing
with
scarcely
less
heartiness
than
they
showed
.
<EOS>
The
absurd
occurrence
seemed
slow
to
impress
itself
upon
his
consciousness
.
<EOS>
Deerfoot
did
not
allow
himself
to
remain
idle
many
minutes
.
<EOS>
The
fractured
front
of
the
craft
being
immovably
fixed
in
the
bank
,
he
leaned
his
head
over
the
side
and
washed
the
paint
from
his
face
.
<EOS>
He
disliked
to
disfigure
himself
in
that
fashion
,
though
he
always
carried
the
stuff
with
him
,
to
be
used
in
such
an
emergency
as
has
been
described
.
<EOS>
The
blanket
stolen
from
him
had
been
carried
away
by
one
of
the
warriors
,
so
that
Deerfoot
held
only
the
rifle
and
ammunition
in
the
way
of
a
reprisal
;
but
they
were
more
than
sufficient
to
replace
the
property
he
had
lost
,
and
he
had
no
cause
for
complaint
.
<EOS>
Stepping
on
solid
land
again
,
with
the
water
dripping
from
his
clothing
,
the
handsome
warrior
stood
erect
,
and
looked
at
Kentucky
across
the
“
Father
of
Waters
.
”
<EOS>
Instead
of
the
villages
and
towns
which
now
grace
the
locality
,
he
saw
only
the
lonely
woods
stretching
north
and
south
until
lost
to
view
.
<EOS>
But
he
knew
enemies
were
there
,
and
the
keen
vision
of
the
youth
was
searching
for
them
.
<EOS>
They
must
have
become
discouraged
over
what
had
taken
place
,
for
not
the
first
sign
of
the
red
men
could
be
discerned
.
<EOS>
They
seemed
to
have
“
folded
their
tents
,
”
and
stolen
off
as
silently
as
the
Arabs
.
<EOS>
But
far
down
the
Mississippi
,
a
canoe
put
out
from
the
Kentucky
side
and
approached
the
opposite
bank
.
<EOS>
It
kept
out
of
sight
until
Deerfoot
the
Shawanoe
had
withdrawn
,
and
then
it
advanced
with
the
care
and
stealth
of
the
trained
Indian
on
the
war
-
path
.
<EOS>
The
craft
was
full
of
Miamis
and
Shawanoes
,
armed
to
the
teeth
,
and
impelled
by
the
greatest
incentive
that
can
inflame
the
passions
of
the
American
Indian
—
revenge
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
XVIII
.
<EOS>
ON
THE
LOUISIANA
SHOREAt
last
the
little
party
were
across
the
Mississippi
.
<EOS>
The
Indian
canoe
,
so
injured
that
it
was
useless
until
repaired
,
was
pushed
back
into
the
turbid
current
and
went
spinning
down
the
river
,
sometimes
bumping
against
the
bank
and
then
dancing
further
from
shore
,
until
striking
broadside
against
a
nodding
“
sawyer
,
”
it
overturned
,
and
thereafter
resembled
an
ordinary
log
,
on
its
way
toward
the
Gulf
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
first
time
that
Jack
Carleton
had
placed
foot
on
Louisiana
soil
,
and
be
stood
for
a
moment
gazing
backward
at
Kentucky
,
amid
whose
confines
he
was
born
and
beyond
which
he
never
strayed
,
except
when
on
an
occasional
hunting
excursion
into
Ohio
.
<EOS>
“I
wonder
whether
I
shall
ever
tread
those
forests
again
,
”
he
said
to
himself
;
“
I
ca
n't
say
that
I
'm
anxious
to
do
so
,
for
there
have
always
been
too
many
Indians
for
comfort
.
<EOS>
They
killed
my
father
and
broke
the
heart
of
my
mother
.
<EOS>
No
,
Kentucky
,
good
bye
<EOS>
,
”
he
added
,
turning
his
face
toward
the
west
,
with
a
feeling
that
in
that
direction
lay
his
future
home
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
Deerfoot
and
Otto
took
but
a
few
minutes
to
prepare
for
their
journey
.
<EOS>
The
Indian
having
lost
his
blanket
,
held
only
the
,
rifle
and
ammunition
by
way
of
superfluous
luggage
,
and
it
could
not
be
said
that
his
companions
were
unduly
burdened
,
since
the
runaway
colt
had
relieved
them
in
that
respect
.
<EOS>
Deerfoot
slung
his
long
bow
back
of
his
shoulders
,
as
he
was
accustomed
to
do
when
he
wished
the
unrestrained
use
of
both
arms
,
and
carried
the
rifle
as
the
others
did
theirs
.
<EOS>
The
belief
obtained
with
all
three
that
in
leaving
Kentucky
they
bade
good
-
bye
to
most
of
the
personal
peril
to
which
they
bad
been
subjected
.
<EOS>
The
reader
knows
that
that
section
was
ravaged
by
the
fierce
Shawanoes
,
Miamis
,
Hurons
and
other
tribes
who
were
implacable
in
their
hostility
to
the
white
men
,
and
who
did
so
much
to
give
it
the
name
of
the
Dark
and
Bloody
Ground
by
which
it
was
so
long
known
.
<EOS>
There
were
thousands
of
red
men
ranging
through
the
immense
province
known
as
Louisiana
,
and
the
crack
of
the
hostile
rifle
,
the
war
-
cry
of
the
dusky
chieftain
,
and
the
shock
,
of
mortal
combat
marked
the
meeting
of
the
races
,
whether
on
the
clearing
,
in
the
forest
,
or
in
the
lonely
defile
in
the
mountain
.
<EOS>
In
that
section
to
which
I
have
referred
more
than
once
,
as
now
bearing
the
name
of
Missouri
,
the
fighting
between
the
whites
and
Indians
was
much
less
than
on
the
eastern
bank
of
the
Mississippi
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
understood
,
therefore
,
why
,
when
the
little
company
of
friends
stood
on
the
western
shore
,
they
felt
much
less
concern
than
while
on
the
other
side
.
<EOS>
Less
than
two
days
'
tramp
to
the
westward
lay
the
young
settlement
where
dwelt
the
mother
of
Jack
Carleton
,
the
parents
of
Otto
Relstaub
and
a
dozen
other
families
who
had
emigrated
thither
from
Kentucky
.
<EOS>
Far
beyond
and
to
the
southward
among
the
wildest
fastnesses
of
the
Ozark
mountains
the
young
Shawanoe
had
taken
refuge
,
where
he
felt
secure
against
those
of
his
race
who
hated
him
with
irrestrainable
ferocity
.
<EOS>
As
it
would
require
no
great
digression
on
the
part
of
Deerfoot
,
and
as
it
was
not
to
be
supposed
that
time
was
very
valuable
to
him
,
<EOS>
Jack
and
Otto
supposed
he
would
go
with
them
the
entire
distance
to
the
log
cabin
of
Jacob
Relstaub
.
<EOS>
To
their
surprise
,
however
,
he
quietly
said
be
could
keep
them
company
only
a
short
time
longer
.
<EOS>
“I
<EOS>
had
no
doubt
you
would
be
with
us
to
the
end
,
”
said
the
disappointed
Jack
.
<EOS>
“It
would
make
the
heart
of
Deerfoot
glad
if
he
could
go
with
his
brothers
whom
he
loves
;
but
he
cannot
.
<EOS>
”“Vot
ai
n't
de
reason
?
”
<EOS>
asked
Otto
,
unrestrained
by
the
sense
of
propriety
which
held
the
tongue
of
Jack
silent
.
<EOS>
“Deerfoot
is
called
yonder
,
”
was
the
reply
,
pointing
south
of
the
path
which
lay
before
the
others
.
<EOS>
They
were
silent
a
minute
or
so
,
in
the
hope
that
,
he
would
explain
his
meaning
,
but
he
did
not
,
and
even
Otto
saw
that
he
had
no
right
to
question
him
further
.
<EOS>
Aware
that
his
friends
were
waiting
for
him
to
add
something
,
Deerfoot
continued:“The
path
of
my
brothers
is
straight
,
and
they
will
not
get
down
on
their
knees
to
look
for
the
trail
.
<EOS>
There
are
no
Shawanoes
among
the
trees
to
fire
when
they
are
not
looking
,
and
Deerfoot
can
may
no
words
that
will
do
good
.
<EOS>
”“It
<EOS>
is
not
that
which
causes
us
to
hope
for
your
company
,
”
replied
Jack
,
who
was
standing
several
feet
away
from
the
youthful
warrior
and
looking
in
his
serious
countenance
;
“
but
it
is
because
we
like
you
,
not
only
for
what
we
have
heard
from
others
,
but
for
what
we
have
seen
with
our
own
eyes
,
and
for
what
you
have
done
for
us
,
that
we
are
loath
to
part
with
you
.
”“Deerfoot
<EOS>
will
go
part
of
the
way
,
”
the
Indian
hastened
to
say
,
perceiving
the
feeling
of
his
friends
,
“
but
it
can
not
be
long
.
<EOS>
”“Far
be
it
from
me
to
question
what
you
do
;
no
right
belongs
to
me
,
but
I
could
not
let
you
go
without
telling
bow
much
we
appreciate
what
you
have
done
for
us
,
and
how
much
we
admire
your
noble
character
.
<EOS>
”It
<EOS>
was
one
of
the
peculiarities
of
Deerfoot
that
he
never
accepted
the
most
pointed
compliment
.
<EOS>
When
forced
to
reply
to
a
direct
one
,
he
turned
it
aside
with
an
indifference
which
showed
he
placed
no
value
upon
it
.
<EOS>
As
Jack
Carleton
remarked
later
on
,
praise
ran
from
Deerfoot
like
water
from
a
duck
's
back
.
<EOS>
But
another
matter
forced
itself
upon
the
attention
of
the
boys
,
who
were
on
their
way
to
the
settlement
.
<EOS>
It
has
been
stated
already
that
the
father
of
Otto
Relstaub
was
penurious
,
miserly
,
and
cruel
.
<EOS>
The
colt
on
which
the
boy
had
ridden
to
Coatesville
,
Kentucky
,
and
part
of
the
way
back
again
,
was
the
better
of
the
two
horses
owned
by
him
.
<EOS>
Its
loss
was
certain
to
throw
him
into
a
great
rage
,
and
doubtless
would
bring
down
the
severest
punishment
on
the
back
and
shoulders
of
the
son
.
<EOS>
Jack
Carleton
understood
this
prospect
as
well
as
did
Otto
himself
,
and
he
was
of
the
belief
that
a
resolute
effort
should
be
put
forth
to
recover
the
horse
.
<EOS>
When
the
matter
was
stated
to
Deerfoot
,
his
own
knowledge
of
the
ill
-
tempered
German
caused
him
to
urge
the
attempt
.
<EOS>
In
fact
he
would
have
done
so
,
had
the
case
been
otherwise
,
for
the
value
of
the
animal
<EOS>
was
considerable
.
<EOS>
Furthermore
,
Deerfoot
was
of
the
opinion
that
the
colt
could
be
regained
without
serious
difficulty
,
and
he
told
them
they
had
little
to
fear
from
hostile
Indians
.
<EOS>
Had
the
Shawanoe
seen
the
canoe
,
loaded
to
the
gunwales
with
red
men
in
their
war
paint
,
which
at
that
very
moment
was
stealing
close
under
the
Louisiana
shore
,
be
would
have
modified
his
remarks
to
a
very
considerable
extent
.
<EOS>
The
peculiarly
original
manner
in
which
the
boys
crossed
the
Mississippi
had
resulted
in
carrying
them
some
distance
below
the
trail
that
trended
to
the
westward
.
<EOS>
As
the
runaway
horse
had
undergone
the
same
experience
,
and
as
Otto
had
descried
him
when
he
emerged
from
the
river
,
it
was
easy
to
locate
quite
closely
the
point
where
he
entered
Louisiana
.
<EOS>
“It
<EOS>
ish
below
vere
<EOS>
we
do
n't
stands
not
dis
moment
,
”
he
said
,
when
they
were
ready
to
move
off
.
<EOS>
“My
gracious
,
Otto
,
”
exclaimed
Jack
,
“
ca
n't
you
handle
English
a
little
better
than
that
?
<EOS>
I
thought
your
father
was
the
crookedest
of
speech
of
any
person
I
ever
heard
,
but
he
ca
n't
be
any
worse
than
you
.
<EOS>
”“Yaw
-
don't
it
?
”
<EOS>
grinned
Otto
.
<EOS>
“Try
to
improve
yourself
!
<EOS>
You
ai
n't
much
of
a
fool
on
other
matters
,
and
you
may
as
well
learn
to
talk
like
a
civilized
being
.
<EOS>
I
have
seen
Deerfoot
shocked
more
than
once
at
the
horrible
style
in
which
you
mangle
the
king
's
English
.
<EOS>
I
want
you
to
promise
to
make
an
effort
to
do
better
;
<EOS>
will
you?”“Yaw
;
I
dinks
not
efery

<EOS>
dot
<EOS>
I
does
much
better
as
nefer

<EOS>
vot
does
n't
you
dinks
not
apout
it
,
eh
-
don't
it
?
<EOS>
Yaw!”Deerfoot
had
taken
a
couple
of
steps
along
the
bank
with
the
purpose
of
hunting
the
hoof
-
prints
of
the
missing
horse
,
but
he
paused
and
half
turned
about
,
looking
with
an
amused
expression
at
his
friends
who
were
holding
their
characteristic
conversation
.
<EOS>
There
was
something
noteworthy
in
the
fact
that
while
Otto
had
heard
the
English
tongue
spoken
quite
correctly
,
from
the
hour
he
was
able
to
toddle
out
doors
,
he
could
not
compare
in
his
lingual
skill
to
Deerfoot
,
who
had
never
attempted
a
word
of
the
language
until
wounded
and
taken
prisoner
by
the
whites
.
<EOS>
What
caused
all
this
difference?The
same
thing
which
distinguishes
one
man
from
another
,
and
crowns
failure
with
success
,
or
reverses
it
,
as
the
case
may
be
—
brains
.
<EOS>
The
three
youths
moved
down
the
bank
in
an
irregular
Indian
file
,
for
no
one
saw
the
need
of
extra
precaution
.
<EOS>
Deerfoot
was
about
a
rod
in
advance
,
walking
with
a
brisk
step
,
for
his
searching
eyes
took
in
everything
in
the
field
of
vision
,
and
the
trail
for
which
he
was
searching
was
sure
to
be
marked
with
a
distinctness
that
could
permit
no
mistake
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
same
apparently
endless
forest
which
met
their
eyes
when
they
looked
across
from
Kentucky
,
and
which
seemed
to
encroach
on
the
borders
of
the
river
itself
,
as
though
envious
of
its
space
.
<EOS>
There
was
little
undergrowth
,
and
they
advanced
without
difficulty
.
<EOS>
“I
dinks
be
ish
close
to
vere
de
colt
<EOS>
goomes
owet
"
,
said
Otto
,
his
words
uttered
with
such
deliberation
that
it
was
manifest
he
was
doing
his
best
to
heed
the
appeal
of
the
young
Kentuckian
.
<EOS>
“That
is
a
decided
improvement
,
”
Jack
hastened
to
say
,
with
an
approving
smile
.
<EOS>
You
do
n't
pronounce
very
well
,
but
you
built
up
that
sentence
better
than
usual
.
<EOS>
”“Dot

dinks

yaw
<EOS>
—
I

Belf
.
”“Good
!
”
<EOS>
said
Jack
,
reaching
out
and
patting
his
shoulder
;
“
if
you
will
devote
a
few
minutes
to
hard
thought
before
speaking
a
single
word
,
you
will
improve
until
one
of
these
days
you
will
be
able
to
speak
as
well
as
Deerfoot
.
<EOS>
”“Yaw
,
dot
ish
nodings
—
yaw
,
holds
on
I
dinks
hard
!
”
<EOS>
exclaimed
Otto
,
resolutely
checking
himself
until
he
could
gain
time
to
frame
the
expression
he
had
in
mind
.
<EOS>
But
before
he
succeeded
,
a
slight
exclamation
from
Deerfoot
made
own
his
discovery
of
the
trail
for
which
they
were
hunting
.
<EOS>
The
others
hastened
to
his
side
,
and
looking
at
the
ground
,
saw
the
hoof
-
prints
of
the
horse
that
had
run
away
with
Otto
Relstaub
.
<EOS>
As
the
animal
was
well
shod
,
there
could
be
no
mistaking
the
trail
,
differing
from
that
of
the
Indian
ponies
,
which
,
as
a
matter
of
course
,
were
without
such
protection
for
their
feet
.
<EOS>
“Yaw
,
dot
ish
him
,
”
remarked
the
German
,
his
effort
being
to
surprise
Deerfoot
as
well
as
to
please
Jack
Carleton
by
the
correctness
of
his
diction
.
<EOS>
A
brief
examination
of
the
foot
-
prints
showed
that
the
colt
had
taken
matters
leisurely
after
emerging
from
the
Mississippi
.
<EOS>
Instead
of
breaking
into
a
gallop
and
plunging
straight
into
the
woods
,
he
had
halted
long
enough
to
eat
what
little
grass
grew
within
reach
,
after
which
he
wandered
off
for
more
.
<EOS>
The
trail
was
followed
several
hundred
yards
,
until
a
rising
ground
was
reached
.
<EOS>
It
was
observed
that
for
the
distance
named
,
the
colt
was
following
a
course
slightly
north
of
west
-
the
very
one
which
,
if
persevered
in
long
enough
,
would
take
him
to
the
log
cabin
of
his
owner
.
<EOS>
Deerfoot
said
it
was
likely
that
the
animal
had
set
out
of
his
own
accord
to
go
home
,
and
,
provided
he
was
not
secured
by
some
wandering
Indians
<EOS>
,
it
was
more
than
likely
he
would
arrive
at
that
point
in
advance
of
the
boys
themselves
.
<EOS>
Jack
Carleton
held
the
same
views
,
and
Otto
,
after
taking
a
full
minute
to
shape
up
his
ideas
,
said
with
great
impressiveness:“Dot
ish
vot
<EOS>
I
dinks
as
—
yaw
<EOS>
,
I
dinks

.
<EOS>
”“Hold
<EOS>
on
,
<EOS>
”
interrupted
Jack
,
raising
his
hand
with
a
laugh
;
“
you
have
it
straight
now
;
do
n't
spoil
it
by
trying
to
improve
it
.
<EOS>
”Otto
<EOS>
nodded
his
head
and
held
his
peace
.
<EOS>
He
was
wise
when
he
did
so
.
<EOS>
Deerfoot
was
on
the
point
of
adding
an
encouraging
remark
,
when
his
keen
vision
detected
something
a
short
distance
in
advance
which
claimed
his
attention
.
<EOS>
Without
a
word
,
he
motioned
for
them
to
hold
their
peace
,
and
then
ran
rapidly
several
paces
toward
that
which
had
caught
his
eye
.

CHAPTER
XIX
.
<EOS>
THE
SMOKE
OF
A
CAMPFIREDeerfoot
identified
the
object
before
reaching
it
.
<EOS>
His
friends
followed
him
doubtingly
,
and
while
a
rod
to
the
rear
,
saw
him
gather
it
up
and
hold
it
aloft
.
<EOS>
“It
is
your
blanket
,
”
said
Jack
Carleton
to
his
companion
.
<EOS>
“Dot
ish
what
it
be
.
<EOS>
”It
<EOS>
was
easy
to
understand
why
the
piece
of
coarse
cloth
lay
on
the
ground
.
<EOS>
Instead
of
rolling
it
up
with
the
smaller
one
belonging
to
Jack
Carleton
,
Otto
had
made
a
separate
bundle
and
strapped
it
behind
the
other
effects
on
the
back
of
the
horse
.
<EOS>
The
latter
in
moving
among
the
trees
had
displaced
it
.
<EOS>
It
was
saturated
with
water
,
which
dripped
from
the
folds
when
raised
from
the
ground
.
<EOS>
Jack
and
Otto
twisted
it
between
them
until
all
the
moisture
it
was
possible
to
wring
out
left
it
in
a
dozen
tiny
rills
.
<EOS>
“
Deerfoot
,
”
said

<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
Shawanoe
bowed
his
head
,
smiled
and
said:“Deerfoot
knows
his
brother
speaks
truth
.
<EOS>
”“I
gives
him
to
you
—

<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
Indian
made
no
move
to
take
it
,
and
Jack
added:“We
shall
soon
find
the
colt
and
with
him
my
blanket
and
the
other
articles
he
has
with
him
.
<EOS>
We
do
not

you
have
none

and
you
have
many
miles
to
traverse
before
you
reach
your
home
;
we
shall
be
glad
if
you
will
take
it
from
us
.
<EOS>
”Deerfoot
partly
raised
his
hand
to
accept
the
gift
,
but
stepped
back
with
a
shake
of
his
head
.
<EOS>
“When
my
brother
goes
to
the
cabin
of
his
father
,
and
,
he
asks
him
for
the
blanket
,
what
will
he
say?”“I
vill
tells
him

<EOS>
I
gives
him

.
<EOS>
”“Then
<EOS>
the
father
of
my
brother
will
strike
him
.
<EOS>
”“I
<EOS>
dinks
dot
ish
<EOS>
so
,
”
said
Otto
with
a
grin
and
shrug
of
his
shoulders
,
“
<EOS>
but
I
be
glad
to
take
a
flogging
for
him
<EOS>
dot
does
so
much
for
me
—
<EOS>
don't
<EOS>
it?”The
<EOS>
youth
compressed
his
thin
lips
and
made
a
single
shake
of
his
head
,
so
positive
in
its
character
that
nothing
more
was
needed
.
<EOS>
“But
,
”
added
Jack
Carleton
,
convinced
from
the
hesitancy
shown
at
first
by
Deerfoot
,
that
he
really
wished
the
blanket
,
“
if
you
are
so
desirous
of
saving
Otto
from
a
flogging
,
it
can
be
easily
done
.
<EOS>
When
we
take
back
the
colt
and
Mr.
Relstaub
asks
for
the
blanket
,
we
can
tell
him
that
an
Indian
took
it
before
we
found
the
horse
.
<EOS>
That
will
be
the
truth
.
<EOS>
”Deerfoot
looked
straight
in
the
face
of
the
young
Kentuckian
,
and
his
lips
parted
as
if
on
the
point
of
speaking
,
but
he
refrained
,
and
with
his
shadowy
smile
,
again
shook
his
head
.
<EOS>
The
gesture
said
as
plainly
as
the
words
could
have
done:“What
you
propose
is
as
much
a
falsehood
as
anything
can
be
.
<EOS>
”“But
I
will
give
Otto
my
blanket
,
”
persisted
Jack
Carleton
,
determined
to
overcome
the
scruples
of
the
remarkable
Indian
,
“
that
will
make
things
right
.
”“Where
<EOS>
is
my
brother
's
blanket
?
”
<EOS>
asked
Deerfoot
with
a
grave
countenance
.
<EOS>
“I
<EOS>
shall
soon
find
it
:
the
horse
ca
n't
be
far
off
.
<EOS>
”“Deerfoot
<EOS>
will
wait
till
my
brother
finds
it
.
”“Well
!
<EOS>
well
"
,
said
Jack
,
with
a
wondering
sigh
,
“
you
are
the
strangest
person
I
ever
saw
.
<EOS>
It
is
n't
worth
while
to
argue
any
question
with
you
.
<EOS>
So
we
'll
let
it
pass
.
<EOS>
”Such
seemed
to
be
the
wish
of
Deerfoot
,
for
,
with
his
silent
step
,
he
moved
along
the
elevated
ground
,
until
he
arrived
at
a
spot
where
the
trees
were
so
few
and
stunted
that
an
extended
view
was
obtained
.
<EOS>
There
the
three
halted
side
by
side
,
and
spent
several
minutes
gazing
over
the
surrounding
country
.
<EOS>
Looking
toward
Kentucky
,
the
majestic
Mississippi
was
in
plain
sight
as
it
swept
southward
,
while
beyond
stretched
the
undulating
forest
,
until
it
met
the
dim
horizon
in
the
distance
.
<EOS>
Far
to
the
southward
was
seen
the
smoke
of
a
campfire
.
<EOS>
It
was
unusually
murky
,
and
,
as
it
ascended
in
a
wavy
line
through
the
clear
atmosphere
,
it
looked
as
if
the
soiled
finger
of
some
great
ogre
had
been
drawn
against
the
clear
blue
sky
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
a
sight
which
every
one
of
the
party
had
seen
before
,
and
it
excited
little
interest
.
<EOS>
It
was
no
concern
of
theirs
<EOS>
what
took
place
in
Kentucky
,
and
Jack
and
Otto
turned
to
survey
the
“
promised
land
,
”
which
opened
out
to
the
westward
.
<EOS>
Woods
,
patches
of
natural
clearing
,
hills
and
misty
mountains
many
miles
away
:
these
were
the
general
features
of
the
immense
area
which
expanded
before
their
sight
.
<EOS>
Ordinarily
there
was
nothing
among
these
of
special
account
,
but
the
eye
of
Deerfoot
,
which
never
seemed
to
lose
anything
,
detected
almost
instantly
a
“
sign
”
that
signified
a
great
deal
to
him
and
his
companions
.
<EOS>
In
a
depression
,
no
more
than
a
furlong
distant
,
could
be
observed
the
faintest
possible
tinge
of
smoke
,
slowly
ascending
from
a
mass
of
dense
forest
.
<EOS>
It
was
so
faint
,
in
fact
,
that
neither
Jack
nor
Otto
noticed
it
,
until
Deerfoot
pointed
his
finger
in
that
direction
,
and
said
“
The
camp
of
red
men!”The
vapor
was
of
a
light
blue
,
just
above
the
tree
-
top
's
,
and
it
rose
only
a
few
feet
more
,
when
it
dissolved
in
the
clear
atmosphere
.
<EOS>
But
it
showed
that
a
camp
-
fire
was
burning
beneath
,
though
it
may
have
been
kindled
many
hours
before
,
and
those
who
started
it
possibly
were
miles
away
in
the
depths
of
the
forest
.
<EOS>
“Suppose
they
are
Shawanoes
or
Miamis
?
”
<EOS>
remarked
Jack
.
<EOS>
“They
are
not
Shawanoes
,
”
said
Deerfoot
quietly
.
<EOS>
“Miamis
then?”“Deerfoot
thinks
they
are
not
Miamis
,
but
he
can
not
be
sure
till
he
sees
the
camp
.
<EOS>
”And
<EOS>
without
further
remark
,
he
went
down
the
slope
with
a
rapid
step
,
which
,
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
say
,
gave
out
no
noise
at
all
.
<EOS>
Jack
concluded
he
could
not
feel
much
misgiving
or
he
would
not
have
allowed
him
and
Otto
to
follow
so
close
on
his
heels
.
<EOS>
But
they
were
some
distance
off
,
when
he
turned
about
and
motioned
them
to
halt
.
<EOS>
“Let
<EOS>
my
brothers
wait
for
Deerfoot
,
”
he
said
softly
.
<EOS>
Knowing
he
would
be
obeyed
without
question
,
Deerfoot
continued
his
advance
,
speedily
disappearing
from
sight
among
the
trees
and
undergrowth
,
while
the
others
did
as
he
requested
.
<EOS>
The
discovery
of
the
camp
-
fire
not
only
caused
some
misgivings
about
the
personal
safety
of
the
little
company
,
but
it
suggested
that
the
missing
horse
was
lost
beyond
recovery
.
<EOS>
Horse
-
flesh
is
the
most
“
sensitive
capital
”
on
the
frontier
,
and
he
who
pilfers
it
runs
more
danger
of
lynching
than
does
the
man
who
takes
the
life
of
a
fellow
being
.
<EOS>
To
the
Indian
,
the
noble
animal
is
as
indispensable
as
to
the
settler
,
and
,
if
the
party
who
had
made
the
halt
in
that
neighborhood
learned
that
an
unusually
fine
steed
was
wandering
near
them
,
they
would
lose
no
time
in
making
him
captive
.
<EOS>
But
from
the
moment
our
young
friends
left
their
elevated
position
,
they
followed
a
different
route
from
that
of
the
colt
.
<EOS>
“Mine
gracious
!
”
<EOS>
whispered
the
disturbed
German
lad
:
<EOS>
“
I
dinks
dot
if
they
do
n't
got

<EOS>
then

and
fader
he
wo

be
as
bleased
as

.
”“There
<EOS>
is
n't
any
hurry
,
Otto
,
in
putting
your
words
together
,
and
it
is
a
good
time
for
you
to
try
to
string
them
so
they
will
make
a
little
sense
.
<EOS>
”“Yaw
;
I
vill
tries
.
<EOS>
”“Sh
!
<EOS>
There
comes
some
one!”It
was
Deerfoot
,
who
appeared
a
moment
later
,
and
beckoned
his
friends
to
join
him
.
<EOS>
His
manner
,
while
not
careless
,
was
so
manifestly
free
from
solicitude
,
that
Jack
knew
there
was
no
ground
for
alarm
.
<EOS>
He
and
Otto
overtook
the
Shawanoe
at
the
moment
he
stepped
into
the
open
space
where
a
camp
-
fire
had
been
burning
some
time
before
.
<EOS>
In
fact
it
was
still
burning
,
else
the
smoke
would
not
have
caught
the
eye
of
the
Indian
youth
;
but
it
must
have
been
smoldering
for
hours
,
judging
from
the
thinness
of
the
vapor
,
and
the
fact
that
little
more
than
a
pile
of
ashes
and
decaying
embers
met
the
sight
.
<EOS>
There
is
naught
to
be
said
in
the
way
of
description
.
<EOS>
The
fire
,
when
kindled
,
had
been
a
large
one
,
and
all
the
burning
sticks
were
in
one
pile
instead
of
two
or
three
,
as
is
often
the
case
.
<EOS>
The
charred
ends
protruded
irregularly
from
the
white
,
feathery
ashes
,
and
one
solitary
brand
,
smothered
almost
from
sight
,
sent
up
the
faint
bluish
vapor
which
,
creeping
through
the
foliage
overhead
,
told
the
vigilant
Shawanoe
where
to
look
for
the
camp
of
his
enemies
.
<EOS>
“How
long
have
they
been
gone
?
”
<EOS>
asked
Jack
,
gazing
carefully
around
and
assuring
himself
that
no
strangers
were
near
.
<EOS>
“They
went
away
when
the
sun
first
came
up
from
the
woods
;
many
hours
have
passed
since
they
left
.
”“Which
<EOS>
course
did
they
take?”Deerfoot
pointed
toward
the
south
.
<EOS>
“Were
you
<EOS>
right
in
saying
they
were
not
Shawanoes?”“They
did
not
belong
to
my
tribe
.
<EOS>
”“Ah
<EOS>
,
then
they
were
Miamis
.
<EOS>
I
made
up
my
mind
to
that
.
<EOS>
”“My
<EOS>
brother
is
wrong
,
”
replied
Deerfoot
,
with
a
flitting
smile
;
“
they
were
Osage
Indians
.
<EOS>
”“How
<EOS>
do
n't
you
know
<EOS>
dot?”“My
other
brother
is
wrong
:
Deerfoot
said
not
he
did
not
know
it
;
he
does
know
they
were
Osages
.
<EOS>
”Jack
<EOS>
Carleton
poked
Otto
in
the
side
.
<EOS>
“Even
Deerfoot
corrects
your
language
.
<EOS>
”“All
rights
,
”
said
Otto
,
bristling
up
;
“
I'ven
I
do
n't
haf
a
mind
to

I
talks
mebbe
better
nor
you
does

but
ven

<EOS>
I
do
n't

so
I
shets
up
my
mouth
up
<EOS>
,
mebbe
—
don't
it?”Deerfoot
stepped
to
a
fallen
tree
,
which
no
doubt
had
served
as
a
seat
for
most
of
the
party
,
and
picked
up
a
strip
of
blanket
,
hardly
a
foot
long
and
no
more
than
an
inch
wide
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
only
cunningly
woven
,
but
showed
brilliant
blue
and
yellow
colors
on
a
background
of
black
.
<EOS>
“This
was
the
blanket
of
an
Osage
warrior
,
”
said
the
Shawanoe
,
flinging
it
to
Otto
,
who
turned
it
over
several
times
in
silence
,
<EOS>
Jack
looking
over
his
shoulder
.
<EOS>
“I
suppose
he
caught
sight
of
that
before
we
came
up
and
learned
the
truth
;
do
n't
you
think
so?”“I
do
n't
dink
nodings
more
,
”
replied
Otto
,
still
pouting
from
the
offence
given
a
few
minutes
previous
.
<EOS>
Bending
over
,
Deerfoot
carefully
drew
some
leaves
aside
and
revealed
the
upper
bone
of
a
deer
's
foreleg
,
to
which
a
good
quantity
of
partially
broiled
venison
was
clinging
.
<EOS>
Judging
from
this
discovery
and
the
number
of
bones
scattered
about
,
the
Osages
had
more
food
than
they
needed
.
<EOS>
“We
<EOS>
—
that
is
,
you
and
I
,
Deerfoot
—
are
hungry
.
<EOS>
Is
the
meat
in
shape
for
us
to
eat?”The
Shawanoe
had
satisfied
himself
by
examination
that
it
was
ready
for
the
palate
,
and
he
so
expressed
himself
.
<EOS>
“That
is
good
;
there
is
just
enough
to
make
as
a
good
dinner
.
<EOS>
Otto
does
n't
look
as
though
he
cared
about
any
,
and
he
can
wait
till
tomorrow
.
<EOS>
”This
statement
of
the
situation
quickly
loosened
the
tongue
of
the
sturdy
German
,
whose
hunger
had
reached
a
ravenous
point
.
<EOS>
“I
speaks
mit
myself
<EOS>
luf
<EOS>
ven
<EOS>
I
vishes
,
”
he
hastened
to
say
;
“
I
vos
as
hungry
as
nefer
could
be
,
and
what
for
you
dinks
I
ai
n't
,
eh?”Jack
laughed
,
and
<EOS>
,
sitting
on
the
same
tree
which
had
served
the
red
men
,
all
three
used
their
keen
hunting
-
knives
upon
the
rarely
-
cooked
meat
.
<EOS>
They
could
have
enjoyed
much
more
<EOS>
had
it
been
at
their
disposal
;
but
as
it
was
,
they
made
a
substantial
meal
,
receiving
enough
nourishment
to
last
them
till
the
morrow
.
<EOS>
“How
many
warriors
were
here
?
”
<EOS>
asked
Jack
of
their
leader
.
<EOS>
“Seven
,
”
was
the
prompt
reply
.
<EOS>
“What
brought
them
to
this
place?”“They
were
hunting
;
an
Osage
village
is
not
many
miles
off
yonder
,
”
said
Deerfoot
,
pointing
to
the
southwest
;
“
and
they
have
gone
there
.
<EOS>
They
spent
the
night
here
.
<EOS>
”“Did
<EOS>
they
get
my
horse
?
”
<EOS>
asked
Otto
,
whose
face
was
aglow
with
good
nature
and
grease
.
<EOS>
“My
brother
shall
soon
know
.

”CHAPTER
XX
.
<EOS>
“
GOOD
-
BYE!”Deerfoot
directed
his
course
toward
the
elevation
where
he
and
his
friends
stood
when
they
first
caught
sight
of
the
smoke
of
the
camp
-
fire
.
<EOS>
It
was
an
easy
matter
to
determine
,
whether
the
Osages
had
discovered
the
horse
while
in
that
section
.
<EOS>
If
they
had
not
done
so
,
the
probabilities
were
against
their
finding
him
at
all
.
<EOS>
An
interesting
question
had
already
been
answered
by
Deerfoot
,
respecting
the
degree
of
hostility
of
the
Osage
Indians
.
<EOS>
There
was
comfort
in
the
thought
that
they
were
not
active
and
malignant
in
their
enmity
.
<EOS>
They
were
not
likely
to
trail
a
white
man
for
the
sake
of
taking
his
life
,
as
their
fierce
brethren
across
the
Mississippi
loved
to
do
,
nor
did
they
possess
the
courage
of
the
warlike
Shawanoes
,
whose
encounters
with
the
early
pioneers
of
the
West
form
the
most
thrilling
episodes
in
its
history
.
<EOS>
But
,
like
the
vagabond
red
men
of
to
-
day
,
the
Osages
were
of
that
character
that
a
white
man
would
much
prefer
not
to
meet
them
in
a
lonely
place
,
unless
help
was
present
or
within
call
.
<EOS>
If
they
should
come
across
the
two
boys
,
their
treatment
of
them
would
depend
very
much
on
the
mood
in
which
they
happened
to
be
.
<EOS>
They
would
be
inclined
to
rob
them
of
everything
worth
taking
,
and
might
end
the
matter
by
shooting
both
or
turning
them
adrift
without
guns
or
ammunition
.
<EOS>
Had
Deerfoot
been
alone
,
he
would
have
given
them
no
thought
.
<EOS>
He
had
visited
their
villages
more
than
once
,
and
though
the
questions
of
several
of
their
warriors
showed
that
they
regarded
him
with
suspicion
,
they
offered
no
indignity
,
and
made
no
objection
to
his
departure
.
<EOS>
Had
the
Osages
found
the
wandering
they
would
refuse
to
give
him
up
on
the
demand
of
the
owner
.
<EOS>
In
that
case
,
as
in
one
already
related
,
he
could
be
regained
only
by
strategy
,
in
which
the
boys
were
sure
to
need
the
help
of
Deerfoot
.
<EOS>
But
all
this
speculation
speedily
ended
.
<EOS>
An
examination
revealed
the
fact
that
the
trail
of
the
steed
and
that
of
the
warriors
crossed
,
but
the
latter
was
fully
two
hours
older
than
the
former
,
and
from
the
point
of
intersection
they
diverged
.
<EOS>
Thus
it
was
proven
that
the
colt
had
been
grazing
for
a
considerable
time
close
to
the
Indians
without
them
suspecting
it
.
<EOS>
The
Osages
had
continued
traveling
in
a
southwesterly
direction
,
while
the
stray
horse
had
kept
on
in
a
course
slightly
to
the
north
of
west
.
<EOS>
There
could
be
no
doubt
that
the
warriors
were
making
their
way
homeward
,
while
the
animal
seemed
guided
by
an
instinct
that
promised
to
place
him
in
the
possession
of
his
owner
,
without
any
assistance
from
the
son
.
<EOS>
The
discovery
was
most
gratifying
to
all
parties
,
Deerfoot
expressing
his
pleasure
that
Otto
was
not
likely
to
suffer
at
the
hands
of
his
irate
parent
for
the
disaster
which
was
unavoidable
on
his
part
.
<EOS>
“Good
fortune
awaits
my
brother
,
”
said
he
;
“
he
may
not
meet
any
red
men
on
his
way
home
,
where
Deerfoot
hopes
the
horse
will
greet
him
when
he
arrives
.
<EOS>
”“Did
<EOS>
you
see
any
Indians
on
this
side
the
Mississippi
when
you
were
riding
him
?
”
<EOS>
asked
Jack
.
<EOS>
Otto
shook
his
head
,
as
he
was
sure
that
style
of
answer
could
not
be
criticized
by
either
of
his
companions
.
<EOS>
“The
outlook
is
a
good
one
indeed
,
”
said
Jack
,
heartily
;
“
and
what
you
have
done
,
Deerfoot
,
is
more
than
we
can
ever
repay
.
<EOS>
You
need
not
be
,
told
that
if
it
ever
comes
within
our
power
to
give
you
help
,
it
will
not
be
denied
.
”To
<EOS>
their
surprise
the
young
Shawanoe
extended
his
hand
to
Otto
.
<EOS>
“Good
-
bye
,
brother
.
<EOS>
”The
lad
shook
it
warmly
,
and
said:“Ish
you
going
not
—
I
means
,
will
you
leave
us?”“Deerfoot
must
go
;
<EOS>
good
-
bye
,
brother
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
second
farewell
was
addressed
to
Jack
Carleton
,
who
fervently
pressed
the
soft
hand
,
an
said
with
much
<EOS>
feeling:“Sorry
are
we
to
part
company
,
but
you
your
own
master
.
<EOS>
I
hope
we
shall
soon
meet
again!”“We
<EOS>
shall
,
”
was
all
that
the
Shawanoe
said
as
he
released
his
hand
and
moved
off
,
vanishing
almost
instantly
among
the
trees
.
<EOS>
The
boys
stood
several
minutes
,
silent
and
thoughtful
,
looking
toward
the
point
where
the
Shawanoe
was
last
seen
,
as
though
they
expected
him
to
return
;
but
the
silence
around
them
continued
as
profound
as
at
“
creation
's
morn
.
”
<EOS>
They
knew
that
when
the
young
warrior
took
such
a
step
,
he
was
in
earnest
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
been
glad
to
keep
them
company
,
but
some
good
reason
took
him
in
another
direction
.
<EOS>
“We
<EOS>
shall
meet
him
again
,
”
said
Jack
Carleton
,
with
a
slight
sigh
of
regret
,
recalling
the
last
words
of
Deerfoot
;
“
from
all
that
was
told
me
about
him
in
Kentucky
,
he
is
such
a
friend
to
the
whites
that
he
was
never
away
from
their
settlements
for
a
very
long
time
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
anxious
to
know
him
.
<EOS>
”“They
<EOS>
used
to
dell
von
great
shtories
apout
him
,
”
said
Otto
,
speaking
with
great
care
.
<EOS>
“And
I
never
believed
one
half
of
them
.
<EOS>
The
idea
of
a
young
Shawanoe
reading
his
Bible
every
day
,
and
being
able
to
write
the
prettiest
kind
of
a
band
,
was
something
that
made
us
laugh
,
but
every
word
of
it
was
true
,
as
he
proved
to
us
.
<EOS>
”“Den
vot
pig
dings
be
<EOS>
doos
in
de
woods!”“I
should
say
so
.
<EOS>
Just
think
of
it
,
Otto
!
<EOS>
There
we
were
among
a
pile
of
logs
,
surrounded
as
you
may
say
by
Indian
warriors
,
bent
on
having
our
scalps
,
and
yet
he
delivered
a
letter
to
us
,
explaining
the
plan
he
had
formed
,
and
then
alone
<EOS>
scared
away
the
whole
lot
,
so
we
could
out
.
<EOS>
When
you
get
back
home
and
tell
parents
this
story
,
what
will
they
say?”“Mine
fader
will
say
nodings
,
but
he
vill
cut
pig
stick
and
bang
me
as
bard
as
nefer
vos
lying
.
<EOS>
”“And
I
ca
n't
wonder
much
at
it
,
”
said
Jack
with
a
laugh
,
“
but
it
will
be
truth
,
nevertheless
,
and
it
is
no
more
wonderful
than
many
things
he
has
done
.
<EOS>
”“Vy
<EOS>
does
n't
dey
calls
him
Deerfoot
—
<EOS>
dot
ish
<EOS>
,
why
does
dey?”“On
account
of
his
fleetness
;
he
is
the
swiftest
runner
ever
known
in
Kentucky
.
<EOS>
A
year
or
two
ago
,
he
was
captured
by
the
Wyandots
,
who
hate
him
worse
than
poison
.
<EOS>
He
pretended
he
was
lame
,
which
put
the
idea
in
the
head
of
his
capture
to
have
some
fun
with
him
.
<EOS>
They
took
him
out
on
a
long
clearing
and
placed
him
in
front
of
the
swiftest
warriors
,
and
then
told
him
to
run
for
his
life
.
<EOS>
Well
,
he
ran
.
<EOS>
”“Did
<EOS>
they
cotch
him
and
kill
him
,
or
did
n't
he
get
away?”“Those
Indians
,
”
said
Jack
,
ignoring
the
absurdity
of
Otto
's
question
,
“
saw
such
running
as
they
never
looked
upon
before
.
<EOS>
Deerfoot
just
scooted
away
from
them
,
as
though
he
had
wings
.
<EOS>
One
of
the
Hurons
had
treated
him
very
bad
and
Deerfoot
paid
him
.
<EOS>
”“How
<EOS>
vosn't
<EOS>
dot?”“He
drove
his
tomahawk
through
his
skull
.
<EOS>
”“Yaw
<EOS>
;
I
dinks
he
does
n't
bodder
Deerfoot
not
much
more
.
<EOS>
”“I
never
heard
that
he
did
,
but
you
ca
n't
understand
why
the
Indians
hate
him
as
they
do
.
<EOS>
I
've
heard
that
Tecumseh
offered
a
dozen
horses
,
and
I
do
n't
know
how
much
wampum
and
other
presents
,
to
the
warrior
who
would
bring
back
his
scalp
.
<EOS>
But
I
've
no
doubt
he
had
to
send
out
a
proclamation
taking
back
the
offer
.
”“Vy
<EOS>
vosn't
<EOS>
dot?”“I've
been
told
that
the
rule
was
when
a
Huron
or
Shawanoe
went
out
to
hunt
for
Deerfoot
<EOS>
,
that
was
the
last
heard
of
him
.
<EOS>
He
never
came
back
,
and
you
see
that
Deerfoot
still
wears
his
scalp
.
<EOS>
”“Vere
<EOS>
did
n't

to
vot
<EOS>
did
n't

their
happy
hunting
-
grounds
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
,
their
bodies
were
found
moldering
in
the
woods
.
<EOS>
And
sometimes
no
one
ever
knew
where
they
perished
.
<EOS>
Deerfoot
is
a
Christian
(
and
,
Otto
,
made
me
feel
ashamed
of
myself
)
,
but
he
is
n't
the
kind
to
sit
down
and
allow
any
one
to
walk
off
with
his
scalp
.
<EOS>
Tecumseh
is
a
young
chief
,
who
's
is
ambitious
to
make
war
upon
the
whites
.
<EOS>
He
must
have
concluded
that
if
he
did
n't
stop
his
warriors
hunting
Deerfoot
there
would
be
none
left
for
him
!
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
understand
,
Otto
,
how
it
was
your
father
<EOS>
turned
him
away
from
his
door
,
when
he
stopped
there
at
night
in
a
storm
.
”“Ah
<EOS>
,
Jack
,
you
does
n't
know
how
mean
mine
fader
ish
,
”
said
the
German
with
a
grin
though
proud
of
his
parent
.
<EOS>
“He
could
n't
have
known
that
it
was
Deerfoot
,
”
said
Jack
,
reflectively
.
<EOS>
“Dot
would
n't
make
no
difference
;
he
treat
all
Indians
de
same
.
<EOS>
One
dimes
they
stole
a
pig
vot
did
n't
pelongs
to
him
and
he
whipped
me
as
hard
as
nefer
vos
,
and
he
hates
all
Indians
for
dot
.
”“It
<EOS>
is
a
great
mistake
,
”
added
Jack
thoughtfully
,
“
<EOS>
for
you
know
how
revengeful
they
are
,
and
one
of
these
days
some
trumping
redskin
that
he
has
abused
will
steal
up
to
his
house
and
shoot
him
dead
.
<EOS>
”“Dot
is
vot
<EOS>
I
tolds
him
,
”
said
Otto
;
“
and
he
will
be
as
sorry
as
dunderation
ven
<EOS>
it
afift
too
late
.
<EOS>
”“Well
,
”
added
Jack
,
looking
around
him
,
“
it
is
n't
worth
while
to
stand
here
,
when
we
have
such
a
long
ways
to
travel
,
and
there
is
no
certainty
the
colt
has
n't
changed
his
course
and
gone
away
from
the
settlement
instead
of
toward
it
.
<EOS>
”Otto
<EOS>
agreed
with
his
friend
,
and
,
picking
up
his
damp
blanket
<EOS>
,
he
threw
it
over
his
shoulder
,
and
each
with
his
gun
in
his
hand
,
resumed
the
pursuit
of
the
stray
,
which
they
hoped
was
at
no
great
distance
.
<EOS>
The
hoof
-
prints
showed
that
the
horse
continued
to
take
matters
very
philosophically
.
<EOS>
His
fastest
gait
was
a
leisurely
walk
,
and
often
he
stood
still
and
nibbled
the
buds
of
the
vegetation
not
yet
fully
developed
.
<EOS>
It
was
gratifying
to
find
that
in
spite
of
an
occasional
digression
,
his
general
course
was
as
named
.
<EOS>
It
is
pleasant
to
discover
that
the
missing
wanderer
is
steadily
making
his
ward
,
even
though
he
is
a
long
time
in
arriving
at
his
destination
.
<EOS>
It
was
comparatively
early
in
the
afternoon
when
Deerfoot
the
Shawanoe
bade
them
good
-
bye
,
and
for
two
hours
the
route
underwent
little
change
;
but
at
time
,
Jack
Carleton
was
forced
to
admit
that
the
course
they
were
following
was
not
the
one
to
take
them
to
the
settlement
.
<EOS>
Shortly
after
the
departure
of
their
friend
,
they
crossed
the
trail
over
which
Otto
had
ridden
some
days
before
,
and
then
the
hoof
-
prints
tended
more
to
the
north
,
so
that
,
in
a
general
way
,
the
boys
took
the
direction
of
the
Mississippi
itself
.
<EOS>
It
could
not
be
expected
that
while
keeping
a
considerable
distance
from
water
,
would
follow
its
amazing
tortuosity
,
<EOS>
probably
surpasses
that
of
any
river
on
the
globe
.
<EOS>
Thus
it
came
about
that
<EOS>
sometimes
Jack
and
Otto
found
themselves
close
to
the
immense
stream
<EOS>
and
then
again
they
were
a
long
ways
inland
.
<EOS>
“It
seems
to
me
,
”
said
Jack
,
when
the
afternoon
was
drawing
to
a
close
,
“
that
we
ought
be
quite
near
the
colt
;
we
have
gone
steadily
forward
,
while
he
has
often
stopped
,
and
as
yet
has
not
traveled
faster
than
a
walk
.
<EOS>
”“But
<EOS>
he
starts
a
long
time
pefore
we
starts
,
”
said
Otto
.
<EOS>
“Not
so
very
long
.
<EOS>
There
's
one
thing
quite
certain
:
he
does
n't
care
whether
he
finds
his
way
to
the
settlement
or
not
,
for
he
is
n't
trying
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
”“He
<EOS>
changes
agin
,
do
n't
he?”“Likely
enough
,
and
he
may
turn
still
further
off
from
the
right
course
.
<EOS>
It
is
getting
so
late
that
we
shall
have
hard
work
to
reach
home
with
him
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
”“When
<EOS>
we
fluds
him
we
gots
on
him
and
makes
him
go
like
he
nefer
goes
mit
pefore
.
<EOS>
”“We
<EOS>
wo
n't
be
able
to
travel
fast
until
we
get
him
back
to
the
regular
path
,
where
the
trees
and
limbs
wo
n't
interfere
with
us
.
<EOS>
”“If
<EOS>
Deerfoot
vos
<EOS>
mit
<EOS>
us
<EOS>
he
tells
us
how
close
he
be
to
us
,
”
said
Otto
,
alluding
to
the
skill
of
the
Shawanoe
in
interpreting
the
age
of
a
trail
.
<EOS>
“He
would
do
so
at
a
glance
.
<EOS>
Helloa!”Just
<EOS>
then
Jack
,
who
was
slightly
in
advance
of
his
friend
,
caught
sight
of
a
bundle
similar
that
which
the
Shawanoe
found
several
hours
before
.
<EOS>
Hurrying
forward
,
it
was
seen
to
be
the
blanket
of
Jack
Carleton
,
which
,
like
the
other
,
had
come
displaced
and
fallen
from
the
back
of
the
wandering
horse
.
<EOS>
Like
that
,
too
,
it
was
saturated
with
Mississippi
water
,
which
,
as
far
as
could
,
the
boys
wrung
from
it
.

CHAPTER
XXI
.
<EOS>
THE
NEIGH
OF
A
HORSEThe
stray
horse
appeared
to
be
distributing
the
property
of
the
boys
in
a
promiscuous
fashion
.
<EOS>
So
far
as
they
knew
,
he
still
retained
his
equipments
and
a
roll
of
personal
effects
,
fastened
in
front
of
the
saddle
instead
of
behind
it
,
as
was
the
case
with
the
blankets
.
<EOS>
“Seems
to
me
,
”
remarked
Otto
,
who
began
to
feel
some
weariness
and
impatience
,
“
dot
<EOS>
the
animal
ish
not
a
good
vile
getting
tired
so
as
he
vants
to
sot
down
and
rest
.
<EOS>
”“He
is
likely
to
do
so
when
it
begins
to
grow
dark
,
which
will
be
before
long
,
”
added
Jack
Carleton
,
noting
the
closing
day
.
<EOS>
The
friends
had
been
hopeful
from
the
first
that
they
would
overtake
the
missing
horse
before
sunset
.
<EOS>
They
had
been
cheered
by
the
belief
that
they
were
not
far
behind
him
at
the
start
,
and
it
was
certain
they
had
made
much
better
progress
than
he
,
but
it
now
looked
as
if
they
were
to
be
disappointed
.
<EOS>
When
they
arrived
on
the
edge
of
a
natural
clearing
,
several
acres
in
extent
and
covered
with
a
luxuriant
growth
of
grass
,
they
were
sure
the
horse
was
there
,
but
a
careful
scrutiny
showed
no
signs
of
him
,
though
his
tracks
indicated
that
he
had
cropped
some
of
the
grass
before
passing
on
.
<EOS>
It
was
comparatively
easy
traveling
for
the
boys
,
the
woods
being
notably
clear
of
the
vines
and
undergrowth
,
which
often
added
to
the
labor
of
journeying
through
them
.
<EOS>
They
had
not
yet
seen
bird
,
animal
or
living
person
after
parting
company
with
Deerfoot
,
and
Jack
was
conscious
more
than
once
of
a
strange
feeling
of
loneliness
,
such
as
comes
over
the
traveler
when
wandering
in
a
vast
and
desolate
land
.
<EOS>
“Is
this
so
different
from
Ohio
and
Kentucky
?
”
<EOS>
he
asked
himself
;
“
are
there
no
Shawanoes
because
there
is
no
game
for
them
to
hunt?”He
smiled
when
he
asked
himself
the
latter
question
,
for
his
own
knowledge
rendered
it
pointless
.
<EOS>
He
knew
that
the
game
was
as
limitless
on
one
side
of
the
Mississippi
as
on
the
other
.
<EOS>
The
sun
-
had
gone
down
behind
the
rim
of
forest
,
when
they
found
themselves
on
the
edge
of
a
clearing
more
extensive
than
the
former
,
and
intersected
by
a
small
,
winding
stream
of
water
.
<EOS>
“Here
,
we
will
camp
,
”
said
Jack
,
throwing
down
his
moist
bundle
and
leaning
his
rifle
against
a
tree
;
“
it
will
soon
be
so
dark
that
we
ca
n't
see
the
tracks
of
the
horse
,
and
,
if
we
push
on
,
we
'll
only
have
to
do
our
work
over
again
.
<EOS>
”“Dot
<EOS>
ish
vot
<EOS>
I
dinks
,
”
said
Otto
,
imitating
the
action
.
<EOS>
It
must
not
be
forgotten
that
the
German
,
since
the
reproof
received
from
the
young
Shawanoe
,
had
resolved
to
improve
his
manner
of
expressing
himself
.
<EOS>
He
was
of
the
age
that
he
could
do
so
rapidly
,
and
he
had
(
what
he
never
possessed
before
)
an
earnest
wish
to
succeed
.
<EOS>
Something
in
the
way
of
food
would
have
been
appreciated
by
both
the
sturdy
youths
,
but
nothing
of
the
kind
presented
itself
,
and
it
was
no
great
hardship
for
them
to
wait
until
the
morrow
.
<EOS>
“Vill
<EOS>
a
fire
we
kindle
?
”
<EOS>
asked
Otto
.
<EOS>
“We
may
as
well
do
so
,
for
we
shall
need
it
to
help
dry
our
blankets
,
which
have
enough
moisture
,
even
after
wringing
them
,
to
last
a
week
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
night
was
more
chilly
than
the
preceding
one
,
and
the
warmth
of
the
blankets
would
have
been
pleasant
to
both
.
<EOS>
As
it
was
,
their
only
resource
was
the
extra
fire
,
for
which
they
began
preparations
.
<EOS>
They
were
plentifully
supplied
in
the
way
of
fuel
,
which
they
gathered
,
throwing
it
down
in
a
pile
near
where
they
intended
to
start
the
blaze
.
<EOS>
The
stream
was
small
,
but
the
water
was
clear
,
cool
and
refreshing
.
<EOS>
Whoever
has
been
burned
with
consuming
fever
,
or
tormented
by
a
torturing
thirst
,
can
never
forget
the
ecstasy
which
thrilled
every
nerve
,
when
he
quaffed
his
full
of
the
colorless
,
odorless
and
tasteless
fluid
,
more
exquisite
in
the
delight
it
imparted
than
can
be
the
“
nectar
of
the
gods
.
<EOS>
”“Ali
!
”
<EOS>
said
Otto
,
with
a
long
-
drawn
sigh
of
happiness
,
“
I
could
live
on
dot
.
<EOS>
”“It
<EOS>
's
certain
<EOS>
you
could
n't
live
very
long
without
it
,
”
remarked
his
friend
,
as
be
drew
down
another
armful
of
dry
and
decayed
wood
.
<EOS>
“
I
do
n't
think
there
is
much
to
fear
in
the
way
of
thirst
in
this
part
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
There
may
be
deserts
further
west
toward
the
Pacific
,
such
as
they
have
in
other
parts
of
the
world
,
but
I
do
n't
believe
we
can
reach
them
in
a
week
's
journey
.
<EOS>
”“Ish
not
looking
for
them

”
said
Otto
,
with
a
grin
,
“

”“Our
country
is
too
rich
in
its
natural
resources
to
make
it
probable
that
it
has
much
in
the
way
of
waste
land—”“Mine
gracious

”
<EOS>
exclaimed
Otto
,
with
a
start
<EOS>
,
“
did
n't
you
hear
dot?”“Of
course
I
did
,
”
replied
Jack
,
turning
his
head
like
a
flash
and
gazing
across
the
clearing
.
<EOS>
Indeed
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
either
to
avoid
noting
the
sound
,
which
was
the
unmistakable
neigh
of
a
horse
at
no
great
distance
from
them
.
<EOS>
“Dot
vos
de
golt

”
said
Otto
,
with
a
beaming
countenance
.
<EOS>
“
He

<EOS>
”Night
was
closing
in
so
rapidly
that
the
vision
of
the
two
was
necessarily
shortened
.
<EOS>
They
could
not
see
entirely
across
the
clearing
or
opening
,
but
in
the
dim
,
uncertain
light
,
Otto
Relstaub
was
positive
he
detected
the
animal
they
were
so
anxious
to
find
.
<EOS>
“Dot
<EOS>
ish
he
,
”
he
insisted
,
leveling
his
arm
with
the
extended
finger
pointed
at
a
certain
spot
.
<EOS>
“
He

<EOS>
”Jack
<EOS>
Carleton
was
naturally
strong
of
vision
,
and
he
believed
his
companion
was
right
.
<EOS>
He
was
able
to
discern
some
object
,
which
,
through
the
gloom
,
resembled
a
horse
that
seemed
to
have
become
aware
of
the
presence
of
strangers
,
and
,
throwing
up
his
head
,
had
challenged
them
in
the
manner
named
.
<EOS>
“I
think
you
are
right
,
”
said
Jack
,
still
going
across
the
intervening
space
,
“
though
we
ca
n't
make
sure
without
getting
closer
to
him
.
<EOS>
It
is
barely
possible
that
he
may
be
a
horse
of
another
color
.
<EOS>
”Otto
shook
his
head
by
way
of
dissent
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
be
convinced
be
was
not
looking
upon
the
very
animal
for
which
they
had
been
hunting
ever
since
they
reached
the
western
bank
of
the
Mississippi
.
<EOS>
The
only
way
to
settle
the
doubt
was
at
their
command
.
<EOS>
Nothing
was
to
prevent
a
closer
inspection
of
the
quadruped
that
had
awakened
such
interest
.
<EOS>
They
felt
the
necessity
of
great
care
.
<EOS>
The
horse
was
high
-
spirited
and
wild
,
and
the
taste
gained
of
freedom
had
undoubtedly
increased
the
difficulty
of
his
capture
.
<EOS>
Great
caution
would
be
necessary
to
avoid
scaring
him
away
altogether
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
seen
also
that
if
they
frightened
the
colt
into
dashing
into
the
woods
,
it
would
be
hard
,
under
any
circumstances
,
to
secure
him
.
<EOS>
He
would
run
a
good
distance
,
and
the
morrow
would
compel
another
long
and
laborious
search
.
<EOS>
A
simple
plan
suggested
itself
:
one
would
make
a
cautious
advance
across
the
clearing
,
while
the
other
worked
his
way
around
to
the
other
side
,
so
that
the
two
would
close
in
upon
the
animal
,
as
may
be
said
,
and
if
he
fled
from
the
first
he
would
run
into
the
custody
of
the
second
.
<EOS>
As
Jack
was
quicker
in
his
movements
,
beside
being
a
better
horseman
,
than
Otto
,
it
was
agreed
that
he
should
pass
through
the
woods
until
beyond
the
animal
;
when
he
arrived
at
the
proper
point
be
was
to
notify
Otto
by
means
of
the
whistle
which
had
served
them
so
often
as
a
signal
.
<EOS>
Then
the
young
German
would
use
the
most
seductive
methods
of
which
he
was
master
soothe
the
colt
into
submission
.
<EOS>
What
was
to
be
feared
was
that
in
the
gloom
the
animal
would
fail
to
recognize
his
master
an
would
be
unusually
timid
on
that
account
.
<EOS>
The
moon
would
shed
no
light
on
the
scene
for
an
hour
or
two
,
and
from
what
has
been
said
it
will
be
admitted
that
the
friends
had
undertaken
a
delicate
and
difficult
task
.
<EOS>
But
the
anxiety
of
both
to
obtain
the
animal
was
too
great
for
them
to
throw
away
an
opportunity
,
however
slight
.
<EOS>
Jack
,
therefore
,
passed
the
few
paces
necessary
to
reach
the
cover
of
the
wood
,
and
with
the
promise
that
he
should
soon
be
heard
from
,
disappeared
.
<EOS>
The
fire
had
not
yet
been
started
,
and
Otto
,
stood
leaning
on
his
gun
and
looking
off
in
the
gloom
toward
the
colt
that
had
led
him
on
such
a
long
chase
.
<EOS>
The
darkness
had
increased
since
the
first
sight
of
the
animal
,
so
that
he
was
no
longer
visible
;
but
the
lad
was
confident
he
had
not
changed
his
position
,
nor
was
he
likely
to
do
so
for
some
time
to
come
.
<EOS>
The
trail
showed
that
he
had
been
on
the
move
almost
continuously
since
morning
,
and
he
must
feel
a
certain
degree
of
fatigue
that
would
make
such
a
rest
acceptable
.
<EOS>
Otto
held
his
position
until
Jack
bad
time
to
reach
a
point
beyond
the
colt
,
when
he
laid
down
his
gun
and
began
his
cautious
advance
.
<EOS>
He
walked
straight
across
the
clearing
,
until
once
more
he
was
able
to
trace
the
outlines
that
caught
his
eye
some
time
before
.
<EOS>
“I
<EOS>
does
n't
knows
vot
<EOS>
he
do
n't
change
mit
,
he
stands
where
he
stood
a
few
minutes
after
awhile
,
”
said
Otto
to
himself
,
relapsing
into
his
old
unintelligible
style
of
expression
,
now
that
no
one
was
at
his
elbow
to
criticize
him
.
<EOS>
“
Mebbe
he
do
n't
do
dot
and
mebbe
he
does
,
do
n't
it?”What
the
lad
meant
to
express
was
his
doubt
whether
the
colt
had
moved
during
the
preceding
few
minutes
.
<EOS>
If
he
had
done
so
,
it
was
to
so
slight
extent
,
that
it
was
hardly
noticeable
.
<EOS>
So
soon
as
the
boy
's
eyes
rested
on
him
again
he
was
satisfied
the
colt
was
asleep
in
the
standing
position
.
<EOS>
His
head
was
down
,
and
his
whole
demeanor
was
that
of
rest
,
and
consequently
ignorance
of
what
was
going
on
near
him
.
<EOS>
“Dot
ish
goot
,
”
was
the
thought
of
Otto
,
“
for
he
do
n't
hear
me
<EOS>
ven
<EOS>
I
creeps
up
to
him
,
and
perfore
<EOS>
he
do
n't
knows
it
<EOS>
he
do
n't
know
nodings
<EOS>
and
I
have
him
.
<EOS>
”There
was
promise
of
such
an
issue
of
the
attempt
be
proposed
to
make
,
provided
he
should
succeed
in
stealing
up
to
the
animal
without
detection
.
<EOS>
Otto
stood
motionless
a
moment
,
hoping
to
hear
some
signal
from
Jack
Carleton
,
but
none
came
,
and
it
was
only
simple
prudence
on
his
part
to
move
forward
without
delay
.
<EOS>
“I
<EOS>
dinks
<EOS>
I
does
it
,
”
he
muttered
,
hopefully
,
when
he
found
himself
within
a
couple
of
rods
of
the
colt
without
having
disturbed
it
in
the
slightest
degree
.
<EOS>
“
It
ish
as
easy
as

and
I
will
grab

and

<EOS>
I
whips
him
'cause
he
runs
mit
away
,
and
den
—
<EOS>
mine
gracious!”It
seems
as
if
the
vines
which
had
tormented
him
so
much
during
the
day
were
not
yet
through
with
the
honest
German
.
<EOS>
Even
on
the
tract
of
open
-
forest
or
clearing
they
intruded
themselves
,
and
he
suddenly
felt
the
familiar
rasping
vegetable
wire
twisting
about
his
ankles
.
<EOS>
Impatient
that
such
an
obstruction
should
be
encountered
,
he
made
a
spiteful
kick
of
the
foot
,
meant
to
snap
the
vine
asunder
and
to
free
himself
;
but
he
miscalculated
the
strength
of
the
resistant
.
<EOS>
His
foot
was
more
inextricably
entangled
than
before
,
and
a
second
fierce
effort
sent
him
forward
on
his
hands
and
knees
.
<EOS>
Had
his
rifle
been
in
hand
<EOS>
it
is
more
than
likely
it
would
have
been
discharged
.
<EOS>
Otto
was
angered
,
because
he
was
sure
he
had
frightened
the
colt
into
dashing
off
at
full
speed
.
<EOS>
He
sprang
to
his
feet
and
made
for
the
horse
,
resolved
to
secure
him
at
all
hazards
.
<EOS>
He
was
spurred
on
by
observing
that
the
animal
was
slumbering
so
soundly
that
he
had
not
yet
taken
the
alarm
.
<EOS>
The
distance
was
short
,
and
he
was
very
hopeful
.
<EOS>
“Whoa
,
whoa
dere
,
”
called
out
Otto
,
in
a
soothing
voice
,
“

uttering
the
words
he
was
advancing
with
the
utmost
haste
.
<EOS>
Feeling
himself
nigh
enough
to
make
the
leap
,
he
did
so
,
and
threw
both
arms
around
what
he
supposed
to
be
he
head
of
his
colt
.
<EOS>
And
as
he
did
so
he
discovered
that
it
was
not
the
colt
at
all!CHAPTER

<EOS>
A
STRANGERNo
boy
could
feel
more
chagrin
and
humiliation
than
did
Otto
Relstaub
,
when
he
sprang
forward
,
and
,
seizing
what
he
supposed
to
be
the
stray
colt
,
found
instead
that
he
had
grasped
the
stump
of
a
tree
.
<EOS>
He
was
speechless
for
a
full
minute
,
and
could
only
stand
still
and
wonder
how
it
was
possible
for
him
to
make
such
a
blunder
.
<EOS>
A
tree
close
to
the
edge
of
the
clearing
had
been
stricken
by
lightning
,
and
partly
breaking
off
some
three
or
four
feet
above
ground
,
a
couple
of
yards
of
length
lay
with
the
top
on
the
earth
.
<EOS>
In
the
gloom
of
the
evening
it
could
be
readily
mistaken
for
a
different
object
,
though
Otto
might
well
wonder
where
the
resemblance
to
a
horse
could
be
figured
out
.
<EOS>
But
for
the
neigh
which
reached
the
ears
of
the
young
pioneers
,
they
never
would
have
made
the
mistake
.
<EOS>
Still
the
fact
remained
that
a
short
time
before
a
horse
was
within
call
,
and
Otto
was
quite
sure
it
was
the
one
he
was
seeking
.
<EOS>
Night
,
however
,
had
fully
descended
,
and
it
was
useless
to
hunt
further
before
the
morrow
.
<EOS>
“Dot
ish
too
bad
,
”
he
said
to
himself
,
“
<EOS>
but
ishn't

glad

Jack
did
n't
come
up
and
sees
me
,
for
he
vould
laugh
till
he
went
dead
—
mine
gracious!”It
seemed
indeed
as
if
the
youth
had
arrived
in
a
strange
latitude
,
for
while
he
remained
communing
with
himself
,
he
caught
the
unmistakable
odor
of
tobacco
-
smoke
in
the
air
.
<EOS>
Some
one
was
smoking
a
pipe
whose
fumes
were
too
rank
to
permit
any
mistake
on
his
part
.
<EOS>
The
discovery
was
startling
enough
to
cause
a
shiver
of
fear
,
for
it
was
manifest
he
was
close
to
a
stranger
,
since
Jack
Carleton
did
not
use
the
noxious
weed
in
any
form
.
<EOS>
Otto
bitterly
reproached
himself
for
leaving
his
rifle
beyond
reach
,
for
his
was
the
situation
of
the
individual
who
may
not
have
needed
such
a
weapon
often
,
but
when
he
did
,
he
wanted
it
with
an
emphasis
beyond
question
.
<EOS>
“Dis
ish
de
spot
where
I
does
n't
vant
to
be
,
”
was
his
truthful
conclusion
,
“
<EOS>
so
I
dinks
I
goes
somewhere
else
.
”He
<EOS>
felt
a
strong
yearning
to
break
into
a
run
,
but
dared
not
do
so
.
<EOS>
Though
filled
with
fear
,
his
right
policy
was
to
conceal
all
evidence
of
it
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
turned
about
with
the
purpose
of
walking
off
with
a
dignified
air
;
but
he
had
taken
only
the
first
step
,
when
a
shock
like
that
from
an
electric
battery
went
through
him
,
caused
by
the
single
exclamation:“Oof!”It
was
the
hail
of
an
Indian
.
<EOS>
Otto
was
riveted
to
the
spot
by
the
sight
of
a
brawny
savage
striding
toward
him
.
<EOS>
He
came
from
the
darkness
of
the
wood
,
and
,
when
he
moved
into
the
clearing
,
was
just
in
time
to
catch
the
first
beams
of
the
moon
rising
above
the
forest
.
<EOS>
The
warrior
was
large
,
and
his
size
was
magnified
by
the
blanket
,
which
,
wrapped
like
a
shawl
about
him
,
reached
below
his
knees
.
<EOS>
The
long
,
black
hair
dangling
around
his
shoulders
,
was
ornamented
at
the
crown
by
a
number
of
eagle
feathers
;
but
the
countenance
,
when
shown
by
the
moonlight
,
was
devoid
of
paint
,
which
,
it
may
be
said
,
was
not
needed
to
add
to
its
ugliness
.
<EOS>
His
forehead
was
low
and
broad
,
the
eyes
small
,
black
and
restless
,
while
the
cheek
-
bones
were
not
only
protuberant
,
but
were
unusually
far
apart
.
<EOS>
Instead
of
the
aquiline
nose
,
which
is
so
often
a
feature
of
the
American
Indian
,
his
was
as
broad
as
that
of
the
African
,
badly
disfigured
by
a
scar
across
the
bridge
,
probably
made
by
a
knife
or
tomahawk
.
<EOS>
When
it
is
stated
that
his
mouth
was
wider
than
that
of
Otto
,
enough
has
been
said
on
that
score
.
<EOS>
In
one
corner
,
the
warrior
held
a
pipe
made
of
red
clay
,
whose
stem
was
a
foot
in
length
.
<EOS>
He
must
have
stood
placidly
puffing
this
during
the
entire
time
the
boy
was
stealing
upon
the
supposed
horse
.
<EOS>
In
the
increasing
moonlight
,
the
strong
vapor
rose
in
blue
puffs
from
both
sides
of
his
face
and
poisoned
the
air
above
and
around
him
.
<EOS>
The
position
of
the
Indian
was
such
that
the
blanket
covered
both
arms
,
and
Otto
could
not
see
whether
or
not
he
grasped
a
rifle
beneath
.
<EOS>
The
entire
manner
of
the
red
man
showed
that
he
knew
he
was
master
of
the
situation
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
have
felt
otherwise
,
when
he
saw
a
partly
grown
boy
standing
before
him
,
without
any
firearms
with
which
to
defend
himself
.
<EOS>
“Howdy
,
brudder
?
”
<EOS>
he
asked
,
in
a
gruff
,
guttural
voice
,
extending
his
huge
hand
to
Otto
,
who
dared
not
refuse
it
.
<EOS>
“I
isb
—
ish
<EOS>
—
dot
be
—
ish
<EOS>
well
,
”
stammered
the
poor
fellow
,
vainly
trying
to
speak
in
a
steady
voice
.
<EOS>
The
Indian
gave
a
fervency
to
his
grip
of
Otto
's
fingers
which
made
him
wince
with
pain
,
though
he
dared
utter
no
protest
.
<EOS>
The
act
of
the
warrior
in
advancing
and
saluting
,
caused
his
blanket
to
open
in
front
,
so
as
to
disclose
an
untidy
sash
around
his
waist
.
<EOS>
The
view
was
not
clear
,
as
the
rays
of
the
moon
came
over
his
shoulder
,
but
the
lad
saw
enough
to
satisfy
him
that
the
Indian
carried
a
tomahawk
and
hunting
-
knife
.
<EOS>
However
,
as
the
other
hand
removed
the
pipe
from
between
the
leathern
lips
and
held
it
,
there
was
no
instant
intention
of
using
either
weapon
.
<EOS>
It
is
only
justice
to
the
young
German
to
say
that
,
had
he
possessed
his
gun
,
he
would
not
have
permitted
the
Indian
to
take
his
hand
.
<EOS>
He
knew
the
treacherous
character
of
the
race
too
well
to
give
them
the
least
advantage
;
but
his
belief
was
that
the
best
,
and
indeed
the
only
thing
to
do
,
was
to
avoid
,
so
far
as
he
could
,
giving
any
offence
to
his
captor
.
<EOS>
“Ven
<EOS>
he
do
n't
be
looking
at
me
,
”
was
Otto
's
thought
,
“
then
I
gives
him
the
slip
,
and
runs
and
gots
mine
gun
,
and
shoots
him
afore
heban
do
nodings
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
programme
was
a
good
one
,
provided
it
could
be
carried
out
,
but
it
can
not
be
admitted
that
it
offered
much
chance
of
success
.
<EOS>
Otto
was
never
fleet
of
foot
,
and
as
his
rifle
was
fully
a
hundred
yards
distant
,
there
was
no
way
of
recovering
it
except
by
permission
of
the
red
man
.
<EOS>
“Where
brudder
's
home
?
<EOS>
”
was
the
query
,
as
he
allowed
the
hand
of
the
lad
to
fall
from
his
grasp
.
<EOS>
Otto
felt
authorized
to
answer
that
question
at
least
truthfully
.
<EOS>
“Good
ways
from
dish
place
—
a
way
off
yonder
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
boy
meant
to
locate
his
home
correctly
,
but
when
he
pointed
toward
the
north
,
he
unconsciously
made
a
great
error
.
<EOS>
However
,
it
was
unimportant
.
<EOS>
The
Indian
slowly
shoved
the
stem
of
the
pipe
in
the
comer
of
his
immense
mouth
,
sent
out
several
pungent
puffs
towards
the
face
of
Otto
,
who
,
accustomed
as
he
was
to
the
sickening
odor
of
his
father
's
tobacco
,
was
forced
to
recoil
a
step
and
cough
the
strangling
vapor
from
him
.
<EOS>
Then
the
warrior
solemnly
turned
his
head
and
looked
behind
in
the
gloomy
depths
of
the
wood
,
as
though
he
expected
to
see
the
home
of
the
boy
.
<EOS>
It
is
n't
necessary
to
say
that
,
if
such
was
his
expectation
,
he
was
disappointed
.
<EOS>
When
Otto
observed
the
face
of
his
dreaded
captor
turned
away
,
he
was
thrilled
by
the
sudden
belief
that
the
chance
for
which
he
had
been
praying
had
come
at
last
.
<EOS>
This
was
his
time
to
make
a
sudden
dash
,
regain
his
gun
,
and
become
master
of
the
situation
.
<EOS>
Was
it
possible
?
<EOS>
Beyond
question
,
it
was
literally
life
or
death
with
the
lad
.
<EOS>
The
red
man
would
pursue
and
show
him
no
mercy
.
<EOS>
If
Otto
failed
to
reach
his
rifle
in
time
,
a
second
trial
would
never
be
given
him
.
<EOS>
Absurd
!
<EOS>
he
saw
there
was
not
an
earthly
chance
of
success
;
he
could
only
wait
and
hope
.
<EOS>
Failing
to
discern
the
log
cabin
in
which
Otto
made
his
home
,
the
Indian
turned
back
his
head
,
swinging
it
as
on
a
pivot
,
so
that
the
end
of
the
pipe
-
stem
,
which
,
for
the
moment
,
he
had
been
holding
stationary
in
his
hand
,
resumed
its
former
place
in
the
comer
of
his
mouth
.
<EOS>
“Where
brudder
's
gun?”“I
—
I
do
n't
not
have
him
mit
me
,
”
was
the
awkward
reply
of
Otto
,
nervously
anxious
to
escape
saying
anything
which
would
give
his
captor
a
clue
to
his
property
.
<EOS>
The
warrior
did
not
press
the
question
,
as
he
might
easily
have
done
,
but
he
smoked
his
pipe
another
minute
in
dignified
silence
,
while
Otto
stood
trembling
and
wondering
how
many
more
breathe
he
would
be
permitted
to
draw
before
the
savage
would
leap
upon
him
with
upraised
knife
.
<EOS>
“Brudder
go
with
Osage
chief
—
<EOS>
he
big
warrior
<EOS>
—
oof!”This
was
the
first
announcement
the
Indian
made
of
his
tribe
,
and
the
declaration
that
he
was
a
chief
astonished
Otto
Relstaub
,
who
held
no
suspicion
that
he
was
in
the
presence
of
such
a
dignitary
.
<EOS>
But
he
had
been
commanded
to
go
with
him
,
and
the
youth
could
only
await
more
pointed
instructions
.
<EOS>
The
Osage
motioned
him
to
turn
about
and
he
did
so
,
hopeful
that
his
captor
meant
to
drive
him
across
the
clearing
toward
the
spot
he
and
Jack
Carleton
had
fixed
upon
for
their
camp
.
<EOS>
If
such
was
the
intention
of
the
chief
,
it
would
be
extremely
favorable
to
the
lad
,
but
,
unfortunately
,
the
opposite
course
was
the
one
fixed
upon
.
<EOS>
While
Otto
's
face
was
away
from
his
master
,
the
latter
stalked
around
in
his
front
,
where
,
taking
the
pipe
from
his
dusky
lips
,
he
repeated
his
order
,
by
means
of
gesture
.
<EOS>
“I
<EOS>
vonder
if
he
do
n't
make
a
top
mit
<EOS>
me
,
”
muttered
Otto
;
“
vy
do
n't
he
tie
von
string
<EOS>
round
me
and
spin
me
<EOS>
dot
way?”But
<EOS>
the
boy
was
not
in
a
situation
to
refuse
,
and
,
when
ordered
to
walk
,
he
did
so
.
<EOS>
While
seeking
to
obey
the
Osage
,
Otto
unwittingly
turned
too
far
to
the
right
.
<EOS>
“Oof
!
<EOS>
Dog
!
”
<EOS>
grunted
the
Indian
,
catching
him
by
the
shoulder
and
wrenching
him
part
way
around
;
“
go
—
go
—
<EOS>
go!”The
lad
was
startled
,
for
the
grip
was
of
that
violent
nature
that
it
pained
him
severely
.
<EOS>
It
effectually
dissipated
his
purpose
of
making
a
break
for
liberty
,
at
least
until
a
much
more
promising
opening
presented
itself
.
<EOS>
He
began
timidly
feeling
his
way
through
the
darkness
,
dreading
every
moment
that
he
would
take
a
misstep
,
that
would
bring
down
the
anger
of
the
Indian
in
a
more
dangerous
form
than
before
.
<EOS>
He
was
enveloped
in
gloom
,
so
that
he
kept
both
hands
extended
in
front
to
protect
his
face
.
<EOS>
“I
goes
as
right
as
I
can
,
”
he
observed
,
seeking
to
avert
the
wrath
of
the
terrible
being
that
was
at
his
heels
:
“
when
I
does
n't
goes
right
dot
ish
,
'cause
I
goes
wrong
—
mine
gracious!”It
was
only
a
twig
which
just
then
collided
with
his
eye
.
<EOS>
It
inflicted
no
injury
,
and
he
still
pushed
forward
as
obediently
as
if
it
was
his
father
who
was
driving
him
.
<EOS>
The
Indian
said
nothing
,
but
he
rustled
the
leaves
with
his
moccasins
,
as
if
to
prevent
the
lad
forgetting
his
presence
.
<EOS>
Here
and
there
the
arrowy
moonlight
pierced
the
foliage
and
afforded
Otto
a
glimpse
of
his
surroundings
,
but
most
of
the
time
the
gloom
was
so
dense
as
to
be
absolutely
impenetrable
.
<EOS>
Passing
across
a
dimly
-
lit
space
,
he
could
not
avoid
turning
his
head
and
looking
back
at
the
Osage
chief
as
he
stepped
into
the
feeble
light
.
<EOS>
The
figure
of
the
Indian
was
striking
.
<EOS>
He
was
striding
slowly
along
,
as
if
impressed
with
his
own
importance
,
his
arms
folded
beneath
the
blanket
in
front
,
so
as
to
hold
it
together
and
keep
them
out
of
sight
.
<EOS>
His
teeth
were
still
closed
on
the
red
pipe
-
stem
,
and
the
blue
puffs
passed
over
his
head
as
if
it
were
steam
which
was
working
the
machinery
of
his
legs
.
<EOS>
The
thought
which
constantly
remained
with
Otto
Relstaub
,
and
which
caused
him
the
keenest
suffering
,
was
that
the
Indian
was
likely
at
any
moment
to
leap
upon
him
with
uplifted
knife
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
characteristic
of
the
American
race
that
its
representatives
often
add
to
the
distress
of
their
captives
by
toying
with
them
as
a
cat
does
with
a
mouse
before
crunching
it
in
its
jaws
.
<EOS>
The
lad
was
almost
certain
his
captor
meant
to
slay
him
,
after
first
torturing
him
in
this
manner
,
but
the
poor
boy
could
see
no
possible
way
in
which
to
help
himself
.
<EOS>
If
the
savage
should
spring
upon
him
,
it
would
be
like
the
leap
of
the
panther
-
quick
,
crushing
,
and
resistless
in
its
fury
.
<EOS>
With
a
faint
hope
that
he
might
be
able
to
do
something
for
himself
when
the
worst
should
come
,
Otto
stealthily
drew
out
his
hunting
-
knife
,
and
held
it
tightly
grasped
.
<EOS>
One
thing
was
certain
,
that
,
weak
and
almost
helpless
as
he
was
,
he
would
not
submit
without
making
a
good
fight
for
himself
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
XXIII
.
<EOS>
AN
ABORIGINAL
HOMEThe
terrifying
walk
of
Otto
Relstaub
ended
sooner
and
more
agreeably
than
he
anticipated
.
<EOS>
He
had
in
fact
gone
but
a
short
ways
when
he
became
aware
that
the
Osage
had
a
definite
destination
before
him
.
<EOS>
A
light
flashed
out
from
the
gloom
in
front
,
vanishing
before
the
boy
could
locate
it
.
<EOS>
A
few
steps
further
<EOS>
and
it
reappeared
,
again
dropping
from
sight
.
<EOS>
Otto
was
walking
slowly
,
intently
peering
in
the
direction
and
naturally
wondering
what
it
all
meant
,
when
,
as
he
moved
slightly
to
the
left
,
it
once
more
came
to
view
.
<EOS>
This
showed
that
it
was
visible
only
when
approached
along
a
certain
line
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
an
ordinary
camp
-
fire
,
but
the
light
flitted
in
and
out
of
sight
,
on
account
of
the
objects
intervening
between
it
and
the
spectator
<EOS>
;
there
was
absolutely
but
a
single
line
of
advance
which
would
keep
it
in
view
.
<EOS>
The
Indian
gave
no
expression
to
his
views
,
but
the
rustling
leaves
told
that
he
was
still
treading
on
the
heels
of
the
lad
,
who
knew
that
so
long
as
he
walked
straight
toward
the
light
,
he
was
following
the
wishes
of
his
master
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
something
flitted
in
front
of
the
blaze
,
as
though
a
person
had
stepped
quickly
past
.
<EOS>
But
Otto
had
secured
the
range
,
so
to
speak
,
and
so
far
as
the
trees
and
undergrowth
permit
,
he
advanced
in
a
direct
line
.
<EOS>
The
distance
being
short
,
the
whole
thing
speedily
became
clear
to
him
.
<EOS>
The
fire
was
burning
within
and
at
the
further
side
of
a
wigwam
,
and
was
first
seen
through
the
opening
which
served
as
an
entrance
.
<EOS>
Thus
it
was
that
when
he
diverged
to
the
right
or
left
it
was
shut
from
sight
.
<EOS>
“It
ish
,
de
vigvam
of
him
,
”
thought
Otto
,
“
ish
going
to
takes
me
mit
dere
,
and
pieces
to
makes
de
childrens
laugh
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
boy
softly
returned
the
knife
to
its
place
,
for
he
was
anxious
that
the
chieftain
should
see
no
signs
of
fear
on
his
part
.
<EOS>
A
few
steps
further
<EOS>
and
he
stopped
in
front
of
the
door
of
the
lodge
,
afraid
to
enter
until
something
more
was
said
by
his
master
.
<EOS>
The
entrance
of
Otto
into
the
aboriginal
home
was
anything
but
dignified
.
<EOS>
The
proprietor
observing
that
he
had
halted
,
gave
him
such
a
powerful
shove
that
he
sprawled
headlong
in
the
middle
of
the
“
apartment
.
”“Oof
!
”
<EOS>
grunted
the
sachem
,
bending
his
head
so
as
to
push
his
body
through
the
opening
,
which
was
not
closed
after
him
;
“
lazy
dog!”Otto
did
not
think
it
wise
to
dispute
the
question
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
hurt
by
the
fall
,
and
rising
,
stepped
back
against
the
side
of
the
lodge
and
took
a
good
view
of
his
surroundings
.
<EOS>
The
wigwam
of
the
Osage
chieftain
was
similar
to
those
which
may
be
found
to
-
day
on
the
slopes
of
the
Rocky
Mountains
,
in
the
depths
of
the
wilderness
along
the
Assiniboine
,
on
the
shores
of
Athabasca
Lake
in
the
far
North
,
and
beyond
the
Llano
Estacado
of
the
South
.
<EOS>
It
was
modeled
in
the
same
style
that
was
fashionable
when
Columbus
saw
the
lights
of
the
New
World
twinkling
through
the
gloom
of
the
night
across
the
unknown
sea
,
and
which
will
prevail
so
long
as
the
American
Indian
roams
the
woods
and
wields
the
tomahawk
.
<EOS>
A
half
dozen
poles
were
pushed
into
the
ground
in
a
rude
circle
,
so
as
to
include
a
space
between
four
and
five
yards
in
diameter
.
<EOS>
The
tops
of
the
poles
joined
,
as
do
the
bayonets
of
muskets
when
stacked
.
<EOS>
This
framework
was
covered
with
the
skins
of
bison
and
deer
,
sewed
together
with
the
sinews
of
the
latter
.
<EOS>
At
the
peak
of
the
roof
was
an
opening
a
foot
in
diameter
,
partly
filled
by
the
network
of
poles
there
locked
together
.
<EOS>
This
answered
for
a
chimney
to
the
fire
kindled
at
one
side
of
the
lodge
.
<EOS>
Directly
opposite
the
fireplace
(
if
it
may
be
called
that
)
,
was
the
opening
which
served
as
a
door
,
there
being
no
other
outlet
except
the
one
named
.
<EOS>
The
deer
-
skin
could
be
flung
back
or
allowed
to
hang
down
.
<EOS>
If
the
wind
set
it
to
flapping
,
it
was
pinned
fast
with
a
knife
or
sharp
stick
.
<EOS>
The
ground
in
most
places
was
covered
with
bison
-
skins
,
so
that
in
moderately
cold
weather
they
were
comfortable
and
pleasant
to
sit
and
recline
upon
.
<EOS>
The
skins
composing
the
sides
of
the
wigwam
were
soiled
with
smoke
,
grease
and
dirt
for
alas
!
<EOS>
nearly
all
the
romance
and
charm
enveloping
the
American
Indian
is
dissipated
at
first
sight
by
his
frightful
lack
of
cleanliness
.
<EOS>
But
Otto
Relstaub
had
viewed
the
interior
of
Indian
wigwams
before
,
and
his
interest
was
fixed
upon
the
occupants
,
of
whom
there
were
three
beside
himself
.
<EOS>
The
squaw
or
wife
of
the
chief
was
at
the
further
end
,
or
rather
the
side
opposite
the
door
,
busy
broiling
two
slices
of
venison
on
the
coals
.
<EOS>
She
had
no
kettle
,
pan
,
knife
or
fork
in
the
lodge
,
her
sole
implement
being
a
sharpened
stick
,
scarcely
a
foot
in
length
,
which
she
used
in
turning
and
handling
the
meat
.
<EOS>
When
Otto
came
tumbling
through
the
door
,
the
mistress
was
in
the
act
of
lifting
one
of
the
slices
from
the
coals
.
<EOS>
She
was
on
her
knees
,
and
paused
for
a
second
with
the
meat
in
air
,
while
she
glanced
around
to
see
whether
her
lord
and
master
had
been
imbibing
too
much
fire
-
water
.
<EOS>
One
glance
was
enough
,
and
she
turned
back
and
gave
her
attention
to
the
culinary
operations
.
<EOS>
She
wore
moccasins
,
leggings
,
and
a
species
of
loose
hunting
-
shirt
,
tied
with
a
cord
about
the
waist
,
and
which
protected
her
-
body
quite
well
,
though
the
deer
-
skin
composing
it
looked
as
if
it
had
served
as
a
part
of
the
wigwam
for
a
number
of
years
.
<EOS>
Her
long
,
black
hair
dangled
about
her
shoulders
,
as
did
that
of
her
husband
,
and
she
was
no
more
cleanly
in
her
person
than
was
he
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
the
most
interesting
object
in
the
place
was
an
Indian
infant
,
less
than
a
year
old
,
which
lay
on
a
bison
-
robe
not
far
from
the
fire
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
male
,
too
young
to
walk
,
though
it
had
been
freed
from
the
coffin
-
like
cradle
in
which
the
aboriginal
babies
are
strapped
and
carried
on
the
backs
of
their
mothers
.
<EOS>
The
little
fellow
was
covered
to
his
arm
-
pits
,
the
bare
arms
lying
outside
on
the
bison
-
robe
.
<EOS>
He
kept
these
going
in
an
awkward
,
spasmodic
fashion
,
which
caused
the
infantile
fist
now
and
then
to
land
in
his
eye
.
<EOS>
On
such
occasions
the
organ
winked
very
suddenly
,
and
the
boy
seemed
to
start
with
a
gasp
of
surprise
,
but
he
did
not
cry
.
<EOS>
Young
as
he
was
,
he
had
been
trained
in
the
iron
school
which
makes
the
American
Indian
indifferent
to
suffering
and
torture
.
<EOS>
This
aboriginal
youth
showed
more
interest
in
the
new
arrival
than
did
any
one
else
.
<EOS>
His
fists
became
motionless
,
his
head
flapped
over
on
one
side
,
and
the
twinkling
black
eyes
were
fixed
upon
Otto
as
though
they
would
read
him
through
.
<EOS>
If
we
could
recall
the
fancies
that
flitted
through
our
brains
at
that
early
stage
of
existence
,
what
a
wonderful
kaleidoscope
<EOS>
it
would
present!The
<EOS>
limits
of
the
wigwam
were
so
moderate
that
the
sachem
was
compelled
to
lay
aside
most
of
his
dignity
.
<EOS>
Seating
himself
on
a
robe
,
just
across
from
their
guest
,
he
said
something
to
his
squaw
,
and
then
,
leaning
back
,
with
his
legs
crossed
and
his
arms
folded
,
he
placidly
smoked
his
pipe
and
awaited
supper
.
<EOS>
The
wife
answered
with
what
sounded
like
a
half
dozen
grunts
,
but
did
not
look
around
or
cease
giving
her
full
attention
to
the
broiling
venison
.
<EOS>
The
prisoner
observed
a
long
,
fine
-
looking
rifle
leaning
against
one
side
of
the
wigwam
,
the
powder
-
horn
and
bullet
-
pouch
on
the
ground
near
the
stock
.
<EOS>
Beside
them
,
a
bow
as
long
and
powerful
as
that
of
Deerfoot
;
and
a
quiver
half
full
of
arrows
also
lay
on
the
earth
.
<EOS>
Like
the
Shawanoe
,
the
Osage
was
an
adept
in
the
use
of
both
weapons
.
<EOS>
In
addition
to
the
furniture
referred
to
,
a
few
cast
-
off
garments
of
the
owners
were
flung
on
one
side
,
while
some
additional
pieces
of
venison
lay
upon
,
or
rather
among
,
a
mass
of
leaves
,
where
they
could
be
found
when
needed
.
<EOS>
The
smoke
from
the
fire
found
its
way
through
the
opening
in
the
roof
,
and
the
vapor
from
the
pipe
of
the
Osage
,
after
slowly
winding
above
his
head
,
seemed
to
lean
off
to
one
side
and
grope
its
way
toward
the
same
vent
.
<EOS>
A
partial
draught
was
created
through
the
door
of
the
wigwam
,
by
which
the
impure
air
was
carried
away
,
and
the
interior
rendered
much
more
pleasant
than
would
be
supposed
.
<EOS>
Like
a
true
native
American
gentleman
,
the
chieftain
sat
calmly
enjoying
his
pipe
,
while
his
wife
did
the
work
of
the
household
,
and
she
,
in
accordance
with
universal
law
,
accepted
the
drudgery
as
one
of
the
necessities
of
existence
.
<EOS>
There
were
some
facts
respecting
the
Indian
wigwam
and
its
owner
which
may
as
well
be
stated
in
this
place
.
<EOS>
The
red
man
had
been
a
chief
of
the
Osage
tribe
,
but
a
violent
quarrel
with
his
people
caused
him
to
withdraw
,
and
he
was
living
entirely
alone
in
the
woods
with
his
family
.
<EOS>
The
village
where
he
had
reigned
so
long
was
miles
distant
.
<EOS>
He
had
a
number
of
partisans
who
occasionally
called
at
his
“
residence
”
to
see
and
urge
him
to
return
,
but
he
continued
sulking
in
his
tent
,
smoked
his
awful
pipe
,
and
shook
his
head
to
all
their
appeals
.
<EOS>
The
wigwam
,
while
similar
in
shape
to
the
hundreds
still
to
be
found
in
the
wilderness
of
the
North
American
continent
differed
in
some
respects
,
while
retaining
the
same
general
form
.
<EOS>
Many
a
lodge
contains
but
the
single
ridge
-
pole
,
standing
in
the
centre
of
the
structure
,
which
,
in
the
shape
of
a
cone
,
is
gathered
at
the
top
and
spreads
out
at
the
bottom
,
where
it
is
fastened
in
place
by
pegs
,
similar
to
those
of
the
ordinary
army
tent
.
<EOS>
Otto
Relstaub
,
being
relieved
from
his
fear
of
instant
death
,
became
sensitive
to
the
appetizing
odor
of
the
broiling
deer
-
steaks
,
and
looked
longingly
toward
the
unattractive
cook
,
whose
only
redeeming
feature
was
the
beauty
of
her
teeth
,
which
were
as
regular
and
almost
as
white
as
those
of
Deerfoot
.
<EOS>
When
,
a
few
minutes
later
,
the
slices
of
meat
were
ready
,
the
squaw
flung
one
to
her
master
,
who
dextrously
caught
it
with
his
right
hand
while
he
removed
the
pipe
with
the
other
.
<EOS>
Laying
the
latter
on
the
ground
beside
him
,
he
began
eating
his
supper
,
using
both
hands
,
much
as
a
bear
employs
his
paws
.
<EOS>
The
wife
devoured
her
share
in
the
same
manner
,
the
two
forming
a
striking
,
but
by
no
means
attractive
,
picture
.
<EOS>
The
meat
was
obviously
tough
,
but
their
teeth
were
equal
to
the
work
,
and
plates
,
knives
and
forks
would
have
been
only
an
encumbrance
.
<EOS>
While
the
mother
was
thus
occupied
,
she
kept
looking
across
at
her
baby
,
who
seemed
to
be
watching
her
with
comical
wishfulness
.
<EOS>
By
-
and
-
by
,
the
parent
gave
a
flirt
of
her
hand
,
and
a
piece
of
the
venison
,
which
she
bad
bitten
off
,
went
flying
toward
the
head
of
the
youngster
.
<EOS>
He
made
an
awkward
grab
with
both
hands
,
but
it
landed
on
his
pug
nose
.
<EOS>
He
quickly
found
it
,
and
shoving
it
between
his
lips
,
began
fiercely
sucking
and
tugging
,
as
though
it
afforded
the
most
delicious
nourishment
,
which
undoubtedly
was
fact
.
<EOS>
“I
<EOS>
dinks
they
have
forgot
me
<EOS>
,
”
Otto
said
himself
,
with
a
sigh
;
“
I
vish
dot
she
would
fro
me
a
piece
of
dot
,
and
see
whedder
she
could
hit
mine
nose
;
yaw
—
Id
just
open
mine
mouth
and
cotch
him
on
de
fly
.
<EOS>
”The
lad
had
seated
himself
with
his
back
against
the
side
of
the
wigwam
,
and
no
one
could
have
looked
at
his
face
and
failed
to
know
he
was
as
hungry
as
one
of
his
years
could
well
be
.
<EOS>
Had
the
people
possessed
more
food
than
they
wished
,
and
had
it
been
cooked
,
it
is
possible
they
would
have
tossed
him
a
piece
,
but
,
as
it
was
,
they
had
no
intention
of
doing
anything
of
the
kind
,
as
Otto
plainly
saw
.
<EOS>
“They
am
pigs
,
”
he
said
,
taking
care
that
the
huge
chief
did
not
overhear
his
muttered
words
;
“
if
I
starve
,
dey
will
sot
dere
and
laugh
at
me
till
they
dies
.
<EOS>
”The
meat
soon
vanished
,
and
then
the
squaw
began
fumbling
among
the
leaves
where
the
uncooked
venison
lay
.
<EOS>
Otto
's
eyes
sparkled
with
hope
.
<EOS>
“She
is
going
to
cook
mit
a
piece
for
meawh!”Instead
of
food
,
she
fished
out
a
pipe
,
similar
to
that
of
her
master
.
<EOS>
Walking
to
him
she
held
out
her
hand
,
and
he
passed
over
a
pouch
of
tobacco
,
from
which
she
filled
the
bowl
of
her
pipe
,
punching
in
and
compressing
the
stuff
with
her
forefinger
.
<EOS>
Then
it
was
lighted
,
with
a
coal
of
fire
which
she
deftly
scooped
up
,
and
sitting
,
so
that
she
faced
her
guest
,
she
crossed
her
feet
,
and
leaning
her
elbows
on
her
knees
,
stared
at
him
,
the
picture
of
enjoyment
,
as
she
puffed
her
pipe
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
,
the
baby
eagerly
sucked
and
chewed
his
bit
of
meat
,
and
,
no
doubt
,
was
as
happy
as
its
parents
.
<EOS>
But
this
had
continued
only
a
few
minutes
,
when
all
the
adults
started
,
for
footsteps
on
the
outside
<EOS>
showed
that
some
one
was
approaching
the
wigwam
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
XXIV
.
<EOS>
DEERFOOTWhen
Deerfoot
<EOS>
the
Shawanoe
bade
good
-
by
to
Jack
Carleton
and
Otto
Relstaub
<EOS>
,
it
was
with
the
declaration
that
they
would
soon
see
each
other
again
.
<EOS>
Precisely
what
he
meant
would
be
hard
to
say
;
but
probably
it
implied
that
he
would
take
pains
in
the
near
future
to
make
them
a
visit
when
they
should
be
settled
in
their
own
log
-
cabins
at
home
.
<EOS>
He
left
them
,
as
has
been
intimated
,
because
he
believed
there
was
no
further
need
of
bearing
them
company
,
and
because
business
of
great
importance
to
himself
demanded
that
he
should
take
another
course
,
and
travel
many
long
miles
toward
that
wild
region
in
the
southern
part
of
Missouri
,
which
is
broken
and
crossed
by
the
Ozark
range
of
mountains
.
<EOS>
For
fully
an
hour
after
he
turned
away
from
his
friends
he
pushed
through
the
forest
in
a
south
-
western
direction
.
<EOS>
He
advanced
at
a
leisurely
pace
,
for
there
was
no
call
for
haste
,
and
he
loved
to
be
alone
in
the
vast
solitude
,
where
be
often
held
sweet
communion
with
the
Great
Spirit
,
whom
he
worshiped
and
adored
with
a
fervency
of
devotion
scarcely
known
except
by
those
who
have
died
for
His
sake
.
<EOS>
The
sun
had
descended
but
a
brief
way
in
the
western
sky
when
the
youthful
warrior
found
himself
steadily
climbing
an
elevation
of
several
hundred
feet
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
over
the
ground
before
,
and
he
knew
that
,
after
passing
the
ridge
,
the
surface
sloped
downward
for
many
miles
,
shutting
the
Mississippi
out
of
sight
altogether
.
<EOS>
For
some
time
a
suspicion
had
been
steadily
taking
shape
in
the
mind
of
Deerfoot
,
and
it
was
that
which
led
him
to
hasten
his
footsteps
until
he
reached
the
crest
of
the
elevation
,
where
he
paused
to
make
an
investigation
.
<EOS>
The
thought
which
ran
through
his
mind
was
the
probability
that
all
danger
from
the
Miamis
and
Shawanoes
(
especially
the
latter
)
was
not
yet
at
an
end
.
<EOS>
He
reasoned
from
well
established
facts
;
they
knew
beyond
question
that
it
was
he
who
had
outwitted
them
in
his
efforts
to
save
the
boys
when
they
were
placed
in
such
extreme
peril
.
<EOS>
The
Shawanoes
hated
him
with
an
intensity
beyond
description
,
and
,
despite
the
repeated
disasters
which
had
overtaken
those
who
sought
,
his
ruin
,
they
would
strive
by
every
means
to
revenge
themselves
upon
him
.
<EOS>
What
more
likely
,
therefore
,
than
that
they
had
crossed
the
Mississippi
in
pursuit
?
<EOS>
The
certainty
that
they
had
done
so
would
have
caused
Deerfoot
no
misgiving
,
so
far
as
he
was
concerned
,
but
his
fear
was
for
the
boys
.
<EOS>
He
reasoned
that
the
Shawanoes
would
follow
the
trail
of
the
three
,
including
also
that
of
the
stray
horse
.
<EOS>
When
they
reached
the
point
where
Deerfoot
left
them
they
would
read
its
meaning
at
a
glance
.
<EOS>
They
would
know
the
whites
were
following
the
animal
,
while
the
Shawanoe
had
gone
about
his
own
business
.
<EOS>
Deprived
of
his
matchless
guidance
and
skill
,
the
destruction
of
Jack
and
Otto
would
seem
so
easy
that
two
or
three
would
hasten
after
them
.
<EOS>
The
action
of
their
guide
would
naturally
imply
that
he
had
no
thought
of
any
such
attempt
on
the
part
of
his
enemies
,
who
,
therefore
,
would
be
the
more
strongly
tempted
to
go
in
quest
of
his
scalp
.
<EOS>
As
I
have
said
,
Deerfoot
could
laugh
at
all
such
strategy
when
directed
against
himself
,
but
he
was
uneasy
about
the
others
,
who
would
never
think
of
their
danger
until
too
late
.
<EOS>
Ordinarily
they
were
not
likely
to
encounter
any
red
men
,
except
the
half
friendly
Osages
,
and
would
be
without
protection
against
a
stealthy
shot
from
the
woods
behind
them
.
<EOS>
If
such
an
issue
threatened
,
Deerfoot
felt
that
his
duty
was
clear
:
he
must
spare
no
effort
to
protect
the
boys
to
the
last
extremity
,
and
it
was
the
hope
that
he
would
be
able
to
catch
sight
of
some
almost
invisible
sign
which
would
tell
the
truth
that
led
him
to
halt
on
the
crest
of
the
elevation
and
gaze
long
and
searchingly
toward
the
Dark
and
Bloody
Ground
,
which
had
been
the
scene
of
so
many
fearful
encounters
between
the
pioneers
and
untamable
red
men
.
<EOS>
The
great
river
was
several
miles
distant
,
the
almost
unbroken
forest
stretching
between
.
<EOS>
Deerfoot
narrowly
scrutinized
the
yellow
surface
as
far
as
the
eye
could
follow
the
winding
course
,
but
not
the
first
evidence
of
life
was
to
be
seen
.
<EOS>
Not
a
solitary
canoe
or
wild
animal
breasted
the
swift
current
which
is
now
laden
with
thousands
of
crafts
of
almost
every
description
.
<EOS>
The
searcher
after
truth
hardly
expected
to
discover
anything
on
the
river
itself
,
for
if
the
Shawanoes
were
hunting
for
him
they
had
crossed
long
before
;
but
away
beyond
,
in
the
solemn
depths
of
the
Kentucky
wilderness
,
burned
a
camp
-
fire
,
whose
faint
smoke
could
be
traced
as
it
rose
above
the
tree
-
tops
.
<EOS>
A
careful
study
of
the
vapor
led
Deerfoot
to
suspect
that
it
had
served
as
a
signal
,
but
it
was
beyond
his
ken
to
determine
its
nature
.
<EOS>
There
was
nothing
on
the
other
side
of
the
Mississippi
which
could
afford
the
faintest
clew
,
and
he
began
the
study
of
Louisiana
,
so
far
as
it
was
open
to
his
vision
.
<EOS>
His
altitude
gave
him
an
extended
survey
toward
every
point
of
the
compass
.
<EOS>
As
it
was
impossible
that
any
of
his
enemies
should
be
to
the
west
of
him
,
he
did
not
bestow
so
much
as
a
glance
in
that
direction
.
<EOS>
Again
and
again
the
keen
eyes
roved
over
the
space
between
him
and
the
great
stream
,
but
nothing
rewarded
the
visual
search
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
to
be
expected
that
if
the
Shawanoes
were
stealing
along
his
trail
they
would
stop
to
build
a
fire
—
at
least
not
before
night
closed
in
.
<EOS>
The
only
circumstances
under
which
they
would
attempt
anything
of
the
kind
would
be
in
the
event
of
their
wishing
to
signal
some
message
to
those
left
on
the
other
shore
.
<EOS>
Possibly
they
wanted
reinforcements
,
or
wished
those
who
were
in
waiting
to
make
some
movement
of
their
own
,
and
,
if
so
they
would
be
sure
to
telegraph
.
<EOS>
If
such
was
the
case
,
the
telegrams
had
been
sent
and
the
instrument
—
that
is
,
the
camp
-
fire
had
been
destroyed
.
<EOS>
Nothing
of
the
sort
was
now
to
be
seen
.
<EOS>
But
Deerfoot
did
discover
something
to
the
northward
.
<EOS>
A
long
distance
away
could
be
detected
another
column
of
vapor
—
slight
,
but
dark
,
and
with
a
wavy
,
shuddering
motion
,
such
as
is
observed
when
the
first
smoke
from
the
fire
under
an
engine
rises
through
the
tall
,
brick
chimney
.
<EOS>
He
watched
it
fixedly
for
several
minute
and
then
smiled
,
for
he
rightly
interpreted
its
meaning
.
<EOS>
“There
is
the
wigwam
of
the
Osage
chief
,
Wish
-
o
-
wa
-
tum
,
<EOS>
the
Man
-
not
-
Afraid
-
of
-
Thunder
,
who
lives
alone
with
his
family
in
the
woods
,
and
smokes
his
pipe
.
<EOS>
He
cares
not
for
Miami
or
Huron
or
Shawanoe
,
but
smokes
in
peace
.
<EOS>
”Inasmuch
<EOS>
,
as
no
other
vapor
met
the
eye
,
the
sagacious
Shawanoe
adopted
a
very
different
line
of
investigation
,
or
rather
research
.
<EOS>
He
was
able
to
tell
where
the
lesser
elevation
stood
,
on
which
he
had
bidden
good
-
by
to
the
boys
,
and
could
form
a
tolerably
correct
idea
of
the
line
he
had
followed
since
then
.
<EOS>
If
the
Shawanoes
were
pushing
the
search
for
him
,
several
must
be
somewhere
along
that
line
.
<EOS>
Most
of
the
time
they
would
be
effectually
hidden
from
sight
by
the
foliage
of
the
trees
,
but
there
were
open
places
here
and
there
(
very
slight
in
extent
)
,
where
they
would
be
visible
for
the
moment
to
one
who
fixed
his
eyes
on
that
particular
spot
.
<EOS>
On
the
site
of
the
encampment
,
where
the
little
party
had
eaten
their
meal
,
and
where
not
the
slightest
ember
remained
,
the
pursuers
would
halt
for
a
brief
consultation
.
<EOS>
If
they
divided
into
two
companies
of
pursuit
,
it
was
there
the
division
had
taken
or
would
take
place
.
<EOS>
Unfortunately
the
vegetation
was
so
abundant
just
there
,
that
he
could
not
hope
to
catch
sight
of
any
of
his
enemies
,
until
after
they
should
reach
a
point
a
considerable
distance
away
.
<EOS>
It
would
therefore
seem
impossible
for
him
to
tell
whether
a
portion
of
the
war
party
turned
to
the
northward
in
quest
of
the
boys
,
or
whether
they
all
concentrated
in
the
search
for
Deerfoot
himself
.
<EOS>
It
would
appear
beyond
his
power
,
I
say
,
for
the
extraordinary
youth
to
settle
the
question
,
while
standing
carefully
hidden
behind
the
trunk
of
a
tree
,
but
a
single
slight
chance
presented
itself
,
and
to
that
he
appealed
.
<EOS>
He
knew
the
general
direction
of
the
horse
's
trail
after
it
had
left
the
spot
where
Deerfoot
parted
company
with
his
friends
.
<EOS>
Unless
it
turned
abruptly
to
the
right
or
left
,
it
led
across
an
open
space
,
which
was
in
plain
view
of
the
Shawanoe
,
and
provided
the
crossing
had
not
already
been
made
,
he
would
be
able
to
observe
it
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
watched
this
opening
with
a
keenness
which
would
permit
nothing
to
elude
it
.
<EOS>
His
brain
had
handled
the
problem
with
the
certainty
of
intuition
.
<EOS>
Following
a
process
of
reasoning
which
can
not
be
fully
explained
,
he
convinced
himself
that
the
redskins
had
not
yet
fled
across
the
narrow
space
.
<EOS>
Whether
they
were
to
do
so
or
not
would
be
determined
in
a
brief
while
.
<EOS>
If
the
savages
hunting
Jack
and
Otto
had
gone
beyond
the
point
named
,
before
Deerfoot
fixed
his
attention
on
it
,
then
it
followed
of
necessity
that
those
who
were
so
eager
to
suspend
the
scalp
of
the
youth
from
the
ridge
-
pole
of
their
wigwams
were
at
that
moment
close
upon
him
.
<EOS>
In
any
event
,
he
was
morally
certain
the
whole
question
would
be
settled
within
the
coming
hour
,
for
,
if
no
sign
appeared
,
it
would
be
a
sign
of
itself
that
nothing
was
to
be
feared
.
<EOS>
Fully
aware
of
the
woodcraft
of
his
own
people
,
Deerfoot
threw
away
no
chances
.
<EOS>
He
kept
closely
hidden
behind
the
tree
which
served
as
a
screen
,
as
though
an
enemy
was
in
ambush
within
bowshot
.
<EOS>
He
waited
a
briefer
time
than
he
anticipated
.
<EOS>
His
eyes
were
flitting
hither
and
thither
,
when
a
couple
of
warriors
deliberately
walked
across
the
opening
on
which
his
attention
was
fixed
.
<EOS>
Though
only
two
,
they
moved
in
Indian
file
,
one
directly
behind
the
other
.
<EOS>
There
could
be
no
doubt
they
were
after
the
scalps
of
Jack
Carleton
and
Otto
Relstaub
.
<EOS>
It
was
equally
certain
that
a
larger
number
were
hunting
for
Deerfoot
.
<EOS>
The
fact
would
not
have
caused
him
an
additional
throb
of
the
pulse
,
could
he
have
been
assured
that
no
harm
,
would
befall
his
friends
.
<EOS>
True
,
they
had
displayed
much
courage
and
brilliancy
a
few
hours
before
in
their
contest
on
the
other
side
of
the
Mississippi
,
and
it
would
seem
that
,
with
their
training
from
earliest
youth
,
they
ought
to
be
able
to
protect
themselves
against
an
equal
number
of
red
men
.
<EOS>
But
,
reason
on
the
matter
as
he
chose
,
Deerfoot
could
not
drive
away
the
feeling
that
it
was
his
duty
to
go
to
their
help
.
<EOS>
“The
<EOS>
Great
Spirit
wills
that
Deerfoot
shall
be
the
friend
of
the
white
people
who
are
his
friends
.
<EOS>
The
Shawanoes
and
Miamis
have
no
right
on
these
hunting
-
grounds
,
”
he
added
,
with
a
dangerous
flash
of
his
black
eyes
;
“
if
they
follow
Deerfoot
here
,
he
will
teach
them
they
do
wrong
.
<EOS>
”Clearly
<EOS>
it
would
not
do
for
him
to
take
the
back
trail
and
retrace
his
steps
,
for
that
would
insure
a
collision
with
those
who
were
so
anxious
to
meet
him
.
<EOS>
Much
as
he
detested
them
,
and
little
as
he
feared
the
issue
of
such
a
meeting
,
it
would
be
certain
to
delay
his
good
offices
for
those
who
caused
him
so
much
anxiety
,
and
such
delay
was
dangerous
.
<EOS>
His
purpose
was
to
“
cut
across
lots
,
”
that
is
,
to
hasten
by
the
nearest
route
to
a
point
which
would
place
him
in
advance
of
the
couple
that
were
giving
their
attention
to
Jack
and
Otto
,
and
to
carry
out
that
plan
necessitated
his
making
no
mistake
in
his
judgment
as
to
the
trail
of
his
friends
.
<EOS>
“The
warriors
will
have
to
walk
until
the
sun
goes
down
,
”
he
said
to
himself
,
“
before
they
will
come
up
with
them
;
if
they
run
,
or
if
my
friends
have
paused
to
rest
,
then
they
will
find
them
sooner
.
<EOS>
Deerfoot
must
not
wait
,
for
he
is
needed
.
<EOS>
”He
<EOS>
had
not
yet
left
his
place
behind
the
tree
,
for
he
was
convinced
that
some
of
the
Shawanoes
were
close
to
him
,
even
though
he
had
received
no
proof
that
such
was
the
fact
,
but
that
proof
came
within
the
following
few
minutes
and
before
he
had
yet
stirred
from
his
position
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
XXV
.
<EOS>
AT
BAYThe
“
old
Indian
”
asserted
itself
in
Deerfoot
the
Shawanoe
.
<EOS>
While
every
act
,
and
in
deed
every
thought
,
of
the
wonderful
young
warrior
was
prompted
by
conscience
,
yet
his
views
of
duty
under
certain
circumstances
,
were
fitted
to
bring
a
smile
to
the
face
of
an
impartial
judge
.
<EOS>
While
standing
behind
the
tree
on
the
crest
of
the
elevation
,
he
was
sure
of
two
things
:
he
had
little
time
to
lose
in
going
to
the
help
of
Jack
Carleton
and
Otto
Relstaub
,
and
the
Shawanoes
who
were
trailing
him
were
close
at
hand
.
<EOS>
He
settled
the
dispute
by
deciding
to
stay
where
he
was
a
few
minutes
longer
.
<EOS>
If
his
enemies
did
not
appear
within
that
brief
period
,
he
would
hasten
from
the
spot
.
<EOS>
This
conclusion
on
the
part
of
the
young
Shawanoe
presaged
a
desperate
encounter
between
him
and
his
foes
,
and
he
made
preparation
for
it
.
<EOS>
He
set
his
rifle
on
the
ground
,
with
the
muzzle
leaning
against
the
tree
which
served
to
screen
his
body
,
and
brought
his
long
bow
to
the
front
.
<EOS>
Drawing
an
arrow
from
its
quiver
,
he
glanced
at
it
as
if
looking
for
some
defect
,
but
he
knew
none
was
there
,
nor
was
a
single
shaft
of
the
score
and
a
half
in
the
quiver
imperfect
in
any
respect
.
<EOS>
The
youth
always
made
his
own
weapons
.
<EOS>
He
glued
on
the
feather
which
guided
and
steadied
the
missile
in
its
flight
,
and
he
fastened
the
heads
with
metal
obtained
from
the
whites
.
<EOS>
Every
one
of
his
possessions
had
been
tested
and
proven
.
<EOS>
Deerfoot
grasped
the
bow
loosely
in
the
centre
,
one
finger
of
the
same
band
also
holding
the
arrow
in
place
,
with
the
notch
against
the
deer
sinew
,
not
yet
drawn
backward
.
<EOS>
The
amateur
archer
will
understand
that
he
was
in
form
to
bring
the
shaft
to
a
head
on
the
instant
it
should
become
necessary
.
<EOS>
It
was
some
five
minutes
after
he
had
assumed
this
position
,
and
while
looking
back
over
his
own
trail
,
that
two
Shawanoe
warriors
silently
emerged
from
the
bushes
fifty
yards
off
,
and
stealthily
approached
him
.
<EOS>
They
moved
absolutely
without
noise
,
for
their
woodcraft
told
them
they
were
close
upon
the
most
dangerous
being
they
had
ever
undertaken
to
hunt
.
<EOS>
The
foremost
lifted
his
foot
just
clear
of
the
ground
and
placed
it
squarely
down
again
.
<EOS>
His
head
and
shoulders
were
thrown
forward
,
so
that
most
of
his
long
,
coarse
,
black
hair
dangled
on
both
sides
of
his
neck
and
over
his
chest
.
<EOS>
It
hung
in
front
of
his
face
also
,
and
,
as
his
forehead
was
very
low
,
he
had
the
appearance
,
while
continually
glancing
from
side
to
side
and
in
front
,
of
a
wild
beast
glaring
from
behind
a
hedge
.
<EOS>
He
trailed
his
rifle
in
his
right
hand
,
the
left
resting
on
the
handle
of
a
knife
,
which
,
with
that
of
a
tomahawk
,
protruded
from
his
girdle
.
<EOS>
He
wore
the
usual
hunting
-
shirt
,
leggings
and
moccasins
,
his
body
and
limbs
being
well
protected
.
<EOS>
His
blanket
would
have
been
only
an
encumbrance
,
and
while
he
was
engaged
in
such
delicate
business
,
it
was
left
with
the
canoe
on
the
bank
of
the
Mississippi
.
<EOS>
The
ears
when
visible
through
the
dangling
hair
,
were
seen
to
hold
enormous
rings
of
bone
,
while
the
nose
hooked
over
and
dipped
in
a
fashion
that
showed
that
the
organ
had
at
some
time
held
a
pendant
in
the
way
of
an
ornament
.
<EOS>
The
countenance
was
blackened
and
disfigured
with
paint
,
in
the
style
already
made
familiar
to
the
reader
,
and
the
protuberant
nose
was
rendered
more
striking
by
the
retreating
chin
.
<EOS>
The
Shawanoe
was
crafty
,
cunning
,
treacherous
and
revengeful
,
which
characteristics
<EOS>
it
may
be
said
belong
to
the
entire
American
race
.
<EOS>
The
second
warrior
,
with
the
exception
of
his
features
,
was
the
counterpart
of
the
leader
.
<EOS>
Dress
,
paint
,
and
ornaments
,
even
to
the
strings
of
wampum
around
the
neck
,
were
similar
.
<EOS>
He
carried
his
rifle
in
the
same
style
,
and
his
left
hand
rested
on
the
weapons
in
his
girdle
.
<EOS>
Both
were
strong
and
sinewy
,
and
their
sight
lost
not
the
slightest
object
in
their
field
of
vision
.
<EOS>
It
was
this
precaution
which
apprised
them
,
at
the
same
instant
,
that
they
were
confronted
by
the
most
terrifying
picture
on
which
their
eyes
had
ever
rested
.
<EOS>
They
halted
as
if
transfixed
by
a
lightning
stroke
.
<EOS>
Deerfoot
the
Shawanoe
stood
behind
the
trunk
of
an
oak
,
a
foot
in
diameter
,
with
his
arrow
drawn
to
a
head
and
pointed
at
the
heart
of
the
foremost
warrior
.
<EOS>
The
matchless
youth
was
at
bay
,
and
in
the
exact
posture
for
launching
his
deadly
weapon
—
right
foot
forward
,
bow
grasped
in
the
centre
,
arrow
held
by
the
fingers
of
the
left
hand
,
which
were
drawn
backward
of
the
shoulder
,
while
the
bow
itself
,
on
account
of
its
great
length
,
was
held
diagonally
in
front
.
<EOS>
The
two
Shawanoes
who
suddenly
became
aware
of
their
danger
,
did
not
see
all
that
has
been
described
,
for
Deerfoot
utilized
the
shelter
so
far
as
he
could
.
<EOS>
Most
of
his
body
was
carefully
protected
,
and
,
though
the
bow
was
slanted
,
the
lowermost
point
scarcely
showed
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
tree
from
the
top
of
the
weapon
.
<EOS>
The
warriors
saw
the
head
,
left
shoulder
and
hands
of
Deerfoot
and
the
upper
part
of
the
bow
,
whose
arrow
was
on
the
very
point
of
speeding
toward
them
.
<EOS>
Directly
over
the
shaft
,
with
head
slightly
inclined
,
like
that
of
a
hunter
sighting
over
his
gun
,
were
the
gleaming
eyes
and
face
of
the
young
Shawanoe
.
<EOS>
It
looked
as
if
he
had
turned
his
head
to
one
side
that
he
might
catch
the
music
made
by
the
twang
of
the
string
when
it
should
dart
forward
with
the
speed
of
the
rattlesnake
striking
from
its
coil
.
<EOS>
No
more
startling
sight
can
be
imagined
than
that
of
a
gun
aimed
straight
at
us
,
with
the
finger
of
the
marksman
pressing
the
trigger
.
<EOS>
The
first
proof
the
pursuers
received
that
they
were
within
sight
of
the
youth
they
were
seeking
was
of
that
nature
.
<EOS>
Both
stood
for
a
second
or
more
unable
to
stir
.
<EOS>
But
their
training
prevented
the
spell
lasting
more
than
the
briefest
while
.
<EOS>
The
second
warrior
made
a
tremendous
bound
directly
backward
,
dropping
to
a
squatting
posture
as
he
landed
,
and
then
scrambling
to
cover
with
a
quickness
the
eye
could
hardly
follow
.
<EOS>
While
employed
in
doing
so
,
his
companion
emitted
an
ear
-
splitting
screech
which
made
the
woods
echo
.
<EOS>
He
caught
a
shadowy
glimpse
of
him
as
he
leaped
high
in
the
air
and
fell
backward
,
carrying
with
him
the
arrow
of
the
marvelous
archer
,
which
had
gone
clear
and
clean
through
his
body
,
and
remained
projecting
both
from
the
breast
and
back
.
<EOS>
A
defiant
shout
rang
from
the
elevation
,
and
,
peeping
timidly
forth
,
the
crouching
red
man
saw
Deerfoot
holding
his
bow
aloft
with
one
hand
,
while
he
swung
the
gun
with
the
other
and
strode
off
,
his
face
toward
his
pursuers
.
<EOS>
“Where
are
the
Shawanoes
?
<EOS>
Do
they
love
to
follow
Deerfoot
across
the
great
river
?
<EOS>
His
heart
was
sad
for
them
because
so
many
bowed
to
his
bow
and
arrow
—
so
he
left
them
that
his
eyes
might
not
look
on
their
warriors
who
fell
by
his
hand
;
the
Shawanoes
are
fools
,
because
they
follow
Deerfoot
.
<EOS>
They
can
not
harm
him
,
for
he
is
the
friend
of
the
white
man
,
and
the
Great
Spirit
gives
him
his
care
;
let
the
Shawanoes
send
Tecumseh
and
the
Hurons
send
Waughtauk
;
Deerfoot
stayed
his
hand
when
the
time
had
come
for
Waughtauk
to
sing
his
death
-
song
,
but
if
the
chief
trails
him
across
the
great
river
,
Deerfoot
will
not
spare
him
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
young
warrior
doubtless
would
have
indulged
in
further
annoying
remarks
,
had
he
not
kept
moving
all
the
time
,
so
that
his
last
words
were
uttered
while
he
was
beyond
sight
of
the
terrified
Shawanoe
crouching
on
the
ground
;
but
the
voice
of
Deerfoot
was
raised
to
a
key
which
prevented
any
observation
being
lost
.
<EOS>
The
declaration
,
following
the
act
of
the
youth
,
showed
that
in
his
mind
his
relations
toward
his
enemies
changed
when
they
followed
him
beyond
the
Mississippi
.
<EOS>
In
Kentucky
all
stood
on
the
same
footing
,
and
he
often
showed
mercy
,
but
if
they
pursued
him
into
Louisiana
they
became
his
persecutors
,
and
whoever
crossed
his
path
or
sought
to
molest
him
,
did
so
at
his
peril
.
<EOS>
He
had
voluntarily
withdrawn
from
their
chosen
hunting
-
grounds
,
and
they
would
be
wise
if
they
left
him
alone
.
<EOS>
He
would
not
flee
from
them
like
a
hunted
deer
,
but
would
teach
them
severer
lessons
than
they
had
ever
yet
learned
.
<EOS>
The
death
-
yell
of
the
stricken
Shawanoe
was
certain
to
bring
others
to
the
spot
,
but
Deerfoot
cared
nothing
for
that
.
<EOS>
It
mattered
not
if
there
were
a
score
,
for
,
<EOS>
if
he
chose
to
flee
,
he
could
out
-
speed
the
swiftest
runner
on
either
side
the
Mississippi
.
<EOS>
With
the
thousands
upon
thousands
of
miles
of
mountain
,
prairie
,
river
,
and
wilderness
at
his
back
,
he
could
laugh
to
scorn
the
rage
of
his
enemies
.
<EOS>
Though
he
had
lived
several
months
in
this
section
,
it
was
the
first
time
his
deadly
foes
had
attempted
to
molest
him
.
<EOS>
Self
-
defense
demanded
that
they
should
be
shown
it
would
not
pay
to
repeat
the
attempt
.
<EOS>
Still
retaining
gun
and
bow
,
he
passed
rapidly
down
the
slope
,
and
,
having
previously
fixed
in
his
mind
the
course
to
pursue
,
pushed
forward
at
an
easy
pace
,
which
was
much
swifter
than
would
be
supposed
.
<EOS>
Fast
as
he
journeyed
,
he
had
not
gone
far
when
five
Shawanoes
(
including
him
who
had
so
narrowly
escaped
his
bow
)
,
hurried
to
the
spot
where
the
smitten
warrior
lay
.
<EOS>
They
had
heard
agonized
cry
in
battle
and
knew
what
it
meant
.
<EOS>
The
second
survivor
was
given
but
a
minute
to
flee
,
when
he
encountered
the
others
rushing
thither
,
and
he
turned
about
and
joined
them
.
<EOS>
They
would
have
been
less
arduous
<EOS>
had
they
not
known
that
the
terrible
Deerfoot
was
gone
,
as
was
shown
by
his
defiant
shout
,
which
came
from
distant
point
in
the
woods
.
<EOS>
Precisely
eight
Shawanoes
(
not
a
Miami
among
them
)
paddled
over
the
Mississippi
to
hunt
the
youth
:
the
only
two
absent
from
this
party
were
pursuing
Jack
Carleton
and
Otto
Relstaub
,
while
they
journeyed
toward
the
northwest
,
after
the
stray
horse
.
<EOS>
The
occasion
,
therefore
,
was
a
fitting
one
in
which
to
consult
as
to
the
line
of
policy
to
be
followed
.
<EOS>
It
may
seem
incredible
,
but
it
is
an
unquestioned
fact
,
that
five
of
the
best
warriors
of
the
most
formidable
tribe
in
the
West
decided
to
give
up
the
attempt
to
capture
or
kill
a
single
one
of
their
race
whose
years
were
considerably
less
than
those
of
the
youngest
member
of
the
party
,
and
that
,
too
,
on
the
ground
that
the
undertaking
was
too
dangerous
.
<EOS>
One
of
those
five
Shawanoes
,
became
converted
to
Christianity
after
the
war
of
1812
,
and
settled
in
Kentucky
,
near
the
home
of
Ned
Preston
,
to
whom
he
gave
the
particulars
of
the
council
held
by
him
and
his
comrades
more
than
twenty
years
before
.
<EOS>
Of
course
no
one
of
the
five
admitted
that
personally
he
was
afraid
of
Deerfoot
.
<EOS>
All
expressed
the
greatest
eagerness
to
meet
him
,
where
a
chance
to
engage
in
fatal
combat
could
be
gained
.
<EOS>
Apparently
no
greater
boon
could
befall
them
than
such
extreme
good
fortune
.
<EOS>
But
they
could
not
shut
their
eyes
to
one
or
two
discouraging
facts
:
they
had
entered
a
country
entirely
strange
to
them
,
but
which
was
familiar
in
a
great
measure
to
the
fleet
-
footed
traitor
,
who
could
never
find
himself
lacking
for
some
hole
in
which
to
hide
himself
.
<EOS>
It
was
very
much
like
hunting
in
an
endless
forest
for
the
fawn
that
leaves
no
scent
for
the
dog
to
follow
.
<EOS>
But
worse
than
all
,
the
Shawanoes
could
not
doubt
that
the
execrated
Deerfoot
had
formed
alliance
with
the
Osages
,
who
would
give
him
help
whenever
wanted
.
<EOS>
Such
being
their
theory
followed
that
they
were
not
fleeing
from
a
despised
foe
,
but
from
a
whole
tribe
of
Indians
.
<EOS>
For
five
warriors
to
withdraw
in
the
face
of
such
overwhelming
odds
,
could
not
be
construed
as
cowardice
,
but
only
as
wise
discretion
.
<EOS>
Such
were
the
grounds
on
which
the
party
based
their
decision
,
which
was
accompanied
fierce
lamentations
that
the
fates
had
interposed
to
save
Deerfoot
from
their
vengeance
.
<EOS>
“We
<EOS>
talk
that
way
,
”
said
the
old
Indian
,
long
years
afterward
,
while
telling
the
story
in
broken
English
,
“
and
,
”
he
added
with
a
laugh
twinkle
in
his
dark
eyes
,
“
we
much
brave
—
we
want
to
meet
Deerfoot
<EOS>
but
we
looked
to
see
he
did
not
come
;
if
he
came
,
then
we
would
n't
be
so
much
brave
;
we
turn
,
and
run
like
buffalo
,
we
much
afraid
of
Deerfoot
;
we
no
want
to
see
him
.
<EOS>
”CHAPTER
<EOS>
XXVI
.
<EOS>
AN
UNEXPECTED
INTERVIEWHaving
turned
his
back
on
his
pursuers
,
Deerfoot
gave
them
no
further
attention
.
<EOS>
His
purpose
now
was
to
defend
Jack
Carleton
and
Otto
Relstaub
from
the
two
red
men
in
pursuit
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
remembered
that
the
youthful
warrior
had
fixed
in
his
own
mind
the
course
taken
by
the
others
,
and
he
hastened
to
a
point
where
he
was
hopeful
of
finding
the
trail
.
<EOS>
But
the
calculation
which
led
him
thither
was
drawn
too
fine
.
<EOS>
Like
the
detective
who
spins
a
theory
,
perfect
in
every
part
and
bristling
with
proof
,
he
found
that
a
slight
hitch
at
the
beginning
destroyed
it
all
.
<EOS>
Neither
the
pursuers
nor
pursued
had
crossed
the
spot
where
he
was
so
certain
he
would
discover
their
footprints
.
<EOS>
This
was
a
disappointment
to
Deerfoot
,
who
stood
several
minutes
debating
what
to
do
.
<EOS>
It
would
require
considerable
time
to
return
point
where
he
separated
from
the
boys
follow
them
thence
,
beside
placing
him
well
to
the
rear
of
the
red
men
from
whom
the
harm
was
dreaded
.
<EOS>
It
was
this
fact
which
disturbed
Deerfoot
,
but
there
seemed
no
other
course
open
.
<EOS>
He
could
easily
speculate
as
to
the
routes
by
which
to
head
off
the
warriors
,
but
the
mistake
just
made
warned
him
that
he
had
no
time
guesses
of
that
character
.
<EOS>
Clearly
the
only
thing
to
do
was
to
follow
the
course
named
,
and
with
his
usual
promptitude
,
he
moved
through
the
wood
toward
the
point
where
he
was
more
than
likely
to
come
into
collision
with
the
larger
party
of
Shawanoes
.
<EOS>
He
turned
aside
from
his
own
trail
,
as
he
invariably
did
under
circumstances
,
but
had
not
gone
far
when
he
found
that
which
was
lost
.
<EOS>
The
Shawanoe
halted
and
looked
at
the
ground
with
a
grim
smile
,
for
he
saw
the
print
of
the
horse
's
hoof
,
the
tracks
made
by
Jack
and
Otto
,
and
the
lighter
impressions
of
two
pain
of
moccasins
.
<EOS>
Having
caught
sight
of
the
warriors
not
long
previous
,
he
knew
they
were
at
no
great
distance
.
<EOS>
They
were
walking
at
such
a
leisurely
pace
that
unless
it
was
increased
,
they
were
not
likely
to
overtake
the
unconscious
fugitives
before
they
halted
for
the
night
.
<EOS>
The
Shawanoe
wheeled
and
hurried
along
the
trail
,
with
the
loping
,
noiseless
trot
which
could
be
maintained
without
distress
from
rise
of
morn
till
set
of
sun
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
scrutinize
the
earth
directly
at
his
feet
,
but
glanced
several
rods
in
front
.
<EOS>
He
could
readily
detect
the
trail
that
far
,
and
was
thus
enabled
to
keep
keen
watch
of
his
surroundings
,
without
retarding
his
own
gait
.
<EOS>
He
occasionally
flung
a
glance
over
his
shoulder
,
but
he
was
well
satisfied
that
none
of
the
larger
party
was
after
him
:
they
had
become
impressed
with
the
fact
that
it
would
n't
pay
.
<EOS>
A
quarter
of
a
mile
off
<EOS>
and
he
leaped
lightly
over
a
small
stream
,
which
crossed
his
path
.
<EOS>
He
paused
long
enough
to
learn
that
the
home
had
stopped
to
drink
,
doing
so
with
some
difficulty
,
for
the
water
was
so
shallow
that
his
lips
must
have
stirred
the
mud
on
the
bottom
.
<EOS>
The
boys
did
not
halt
,
but
one
of
the
warriors
had
got
down
on
his
knees
and
hands
,
the
latter
spread
apart
like
the
fore
legs
of
a
camelopard
,
as
to
touch
his
dusky
lips
to
the
water
,
of
which
he
drank
his
fill
.
<EOS>
All
this
Deerfoot
noted
,
with
only
a
few
moments
'
pause
,
then
he
was
off
again
.
<EOS>
But
he
had
gone
only
a
little
way
,
when
he
observed
other
facts
that
were
more
disquieting
.
<EOS>
The
Shawanoes
had
changed
pace
similar
to
his
own
,
and
beyond
question
were
gaining
upon
the
boys
,
who
could
not
know
peril
.
<EOS>
Deerfoot
was
convinced
that
the
red
men
had
hastened
through
fear
of
losing
the
trail
in
the
coming
darkness
.
<EOS>
It
followed
,
therefore
,
that
he
himself
must
advance
faster
or
lose
the
scent
.
<EOS>
While
able
to
follow
the
tracks
of
a
horse
,
entirely
by
the
sense
of
feeling
,
the
progress
must
necessarily
be
too
slow
to
be
effective
under
circumstances
like
those
which
now
confronted
him
.
<EOS>
The
youth
made
a
tremendous
bound
and
struck
a
gait
which
rendered
it
unnecessary
to
look
behind
him
,
for
no
pursuer
could
equal
his
speed
.
<EOS>
He
watched
only
the
forest
in
front
,
through
which
he
was
hurrying
with
a
velocity
that
raised
a
gale
about
his
ears
and
kept
him
dodging
and
ducking
his
head
to
avoid
unpleasant
consequences
.
<EOS>
All
at
once
,
he
leaped
sideways
behind
the
nearest
large
tree
,
set
down
his
rifle
and
bow
and
drew
his
tomahawk
.
<EOS>
He
had
discovered
through
the
gathering
twilight
one
of
the
Shawanoes
returning
over
the
trail
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
fortunate
accident
which
prevented
him
detecting
his
pursuer
,
since
he
was
on
the
watch
against
that
very
danger
,
but
Deerfoot
was
an
instant
quicker
,
and
awaited
him
as
grimly
as
he
confronted
the
two
warriors
who
followed
him
to
the
base
of
the
hill
,
where
one
was
pierced
by
his
unerring
arrow
.
<EOS>
Deerfoot
at
first
believed
both
were
coming
back
,
having
been
summoned
thither
perhaps
by
some
signal
from
the
larger
party
,
but
he
saw
there
was
only
one
.
<EOS>
The
youth
could
have
picked
him
off
without
difficulty
,
but
he
was
too
chivalrous
to
do
so
,
inasmuch
as
the
red
man
was
actually
retreating
instead
of
advancing
,
and
had
not
as
yet
made
the
first
move
against
him
.
<EOS>
A
guarded
peep
from
his
hiding
-
place
showed
the
warrior
approaching
on
a
loping
trot
,
similar
to
his
own
,
his
long
rifle
in
his
right
band
,
while
a
glimpse
was
obtained
of
his
blanket
rolled
and
strapped
like
a
knapsack
behind
his
shoulders
.
<EOS>
He
held
his
head
well
forward
,
his
restless
eyes
scanning
the
wood
as
it
opened
before
him
,
but
evidently
with
no
thought
of
the
danger
which
really
menaced
him
.
<EOS>
All
at
once
,
the
figure
of
Deerfoot
glided
softly
from
behind
the
tree
and
confronted
him
with
his
tomahawk
drawn
back
and
ready
to
throw
.
<EOS>
The
Indian
checked
himself
as
abruptly
as
if
an
unfathomable
chasm
had
opened
at
his
feet
,
but
quick
as
he
was
,
Deerfoot
was
so
close
that
the
latter
could
have
touched
him
with
his
extended
bow
.
<EOS>
The
warrior
,
old
enough
to
be
the
father
of
the
other
,
saw
that
he
was
helpless
.
<EOS>
He
was
without
the
power
to
raise
a
finger
to
save
himself
,
even
though
he
held
a
loaded
rifle
in
one
hand
and
carried
the
regulation
knife
and
tomahawk
in
his
girdle
.
<EOS>
Had
he
made
the
first
motion
toward
using
his
weapons
,
the
upraised
tomahawk
would
have
left
the
grasp
of
Deerfoot
with
the
swiftness
of
lightning
,
and
the
skull
of
his
foe
would
have
been
cloven
as
though
made
of
tissue
paper
.
<EOS>
“Let
<EOS>
the
Shawanoe
obey
the
words
of
Deerfoot
,
”
said
the
youth
,
“
and
he
shall
not
be
harmed
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
other
made
no
answer
,
but
his
frightened
looks
showed
he
was
ready
to
follow
any
orders
received
from
such
high
authority
.
<EOS>
“He
carries
a
blanket
on
his
back
which
Deerfoot
would
love
to
have
,
that
he
may
sleep
upon
it
when
the
night
is
cold
and
he
has
no
camp
-
fire
to
warm
him
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
elder
Shawanoe
dropped
his
gun
to
the
ground
beside
him
,
that
he
might
use
both
bands
more
readily
to
unfasten
the
bundle
for
his
master
.
<EOS>
Flinging
it
at
his
feet
,
he
looked
inquiringly
up
and
awaited
the
next
command
.
<EOS>
Deerfoot
did
not
stoop
to
take
the
article
,
for
that
would
have
invited
a
treacherous
attack
.
<EOS>
He
merely
glanced
downward
and
then
asked
,
“
Whither
is
my
brother
going?”“He
seeks
those
who
sent
him
here
;
they
are
not
far
and
we
heard
the
shout
of
one
of
our
warriors
,
which
we
did
not
understand
.
”“'Twas
<EOS>
his
cry
when
the
arrow
of
Deerfoot
pierced
his
heart
,
”
said
the
youth
with
flashing
eye
.
<EOS>
“
Deerfoot
has
crossed
the
great
river
and
means
never
to
visit
the
other
shore
;
he
has
left
Kentucky
and
Ohio
,
and
the
Shawanoes
must
look
for
his
footprints
on
this
side
.
<EOS>
They
can
not
find
him
,
and
he
will
shoot
them
from
behind
the
trees
and
rocks
.
<EOS>
He
will
flee
from
them
no
more
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
red
man
to
whom
these
words
were
addressed
could
not
fail
to
understand
their
meaning
.
<EOS>
They
gave
distinct
notice
that
the
youth
would
strike
back
,
whenever
harm
was
offered
him
,
while
west
of
the
Mississippi
.
<EOS>
He
had
located
there
for
life
and
was
prepared
to
defend
himself
against
one
and
all
of
his
enemies
.
<EOS>
Beyond
question
,
the
elder
Indian
would
have
given
much
<EOS>
could
he
have
been
in
Kentucky
at
that
moment
.
<EOS>
He
was
watching
for
some
chance
to
turn
with
panther
-
like
quickness
on
his
youthful
conqueror
,
but
the
latter
took
care
that
no
such
opportunity
was
given
him
.
<EOS>
Deerfoot
could
not
know
that
the
group
whom
he
left
behind
had
resolved
to
withdraw
from
the
dangerous
country
,
and
while
their
agreement
would
have
been
interesting
and
possibly
gratifying
news
to
him
,
yet
he
was
not
particularly
concerned
,
since
he
was
determined
to
force
them
sooner
or
later
to
that
conclusion
.
<EOS>
“Deerfoot
took
a
gun
that
belonged
to
one
of
those
who
stole
his
blanket
and
broke
his
canoe
;
his
blanket
has
been
restored
to
him
and
he
will
now
give
the
gun
to
his
brother
.
<EOS>
”This
statement
was
not
understood
by
the
other
,
which
fact
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
,
since
it
was
not
only
in
violation
of
what
may
be
called
common
sense
,
but
the
gun
itself
was
not
in
sight
.
<EOS>
It
was
within
reach
,
however
,
and
the
youth
had
but
to
take
a
single
step
backward
,
when
he
grasped
it
with
his
right
hand
and
proffered
it
to
the
other
,
whose
very
amazement
caused
him
to
take
it
with
much
awkwardness
.
<EOS>
Thus
it
came
about
that
Deerfoot
allowed
the
warrior
to
have
two
rifles
,
both
loaded
,
while
he
stood
guard
over
himself
,
with
only
his
tomahawk
in
hand
.
<EOS>
The
transfer
being
made
,
the
elder
was
at
liberty
to
go
,
so
soon
as
he
answered
a
few
questions
.
<EOS>
He
knew
much
of
Deerfoot
from
reputation
,
and
,
therefore
,
was
not
so
dumfounded
as
otherwise
he
would
have
been
,
when
informed
that
no
harm
would
be
done
him
.
<EOS>
“When
my
brother
left
his
comrades
,
he
took
a
warrior
with
him
,
”
said
Deerfoot
in
his
native
tongue
.
<EOS>
“
Where
is
he?”Daring
as
the
young
Shawanoe
was
<EOS>
,
he
was
guarded
to
give
up
the
gun
,
until
satisfied
the
second
foe
was
not
likely
to
appear
on
the
scene
.
<EOS>
While
he
would
have
made
his
usual
brilliant
stand
against
two
of
his
enemies
,
he
would
have
needed
all
the
means
which
he
possessed
to
combat
them
.
<EOS>
“My
<EOS>
brother
waits
my
return
;
he
sits
on
fallen
tree
and
listens
for
my
footsteps
that
may
learn
what
ill
has
befallen
our
brothers
<EOS>
nearer
the
great
river
.
<EOS>
”“When
<EOS>
my
brother
has
learned
and
tells
them
what
then
will
they
do?”“They
will
hasten
across
the
great
river
and
never
come
back
.
<EOS>
”Deerfoot
smiled
faintly
,
for
he
saw
the
purpose
of
this
remark
;
the
warrior
was
seeking
to
propitiate
his
conqueror
.
<EOS>
The
latter
might
well
have
added
that
,
inasmuch
as
he
had
already
given
him
the
fact
,
the
elder
was
in
duty
bound
to
turn
about
and
hasten
to
his
waiting
friend
with
the
news
;
but
it
was
too
much
to
ask
him
to
accept
the
word
of
an
enemy
,
and
the
youth
preferred
that
he
should
make
the
slight
journey
and
ascertain
the
truth
for
himself
.
<EOS>
What
followed
was
unique
and
curious
.
<EOS>
Deerfoot
stepped
aside
,
just
enough
to
allow
the
other
to
pass
.
<EOS>
The
elder
held
a
gun
in
each
hand
and
stood
motionless
a
moment
,
as
if
uncertain
what
to
do
;
but
his
conqueror
was
waiting
,
and
he
,
therefore
,
advanced
three
steps
,
enough
to
bring
him
opposite
Deerfoot
,
while
the
fourth
carried
him
beyond
.
<EOS>
It
was
at
that
juncture
he
caught
sight
of
the
long
bow
leaning
against
the
tree
where
the
gun
had
been
standing
.
<EOS>
He
longed
to
seize
it
,
but
he
knew
instant
death
would
follow
the
attempt
.
<EOS>
Without
turning
to
the
right
or
left
,
the
released
Shawanoe
strode
by
with
deliberate
and
dignified
step
.
<EOS>
He
held
his
own
gun
in
his
right
hand
,
and
with
no
evidence
of
what
he
was
doing
,
he
stealthily
drew
back
the
hammer
which
clasped
the
flint
.
<EOS>
He
then
noted
carefully
the
number
of
paces
he
took
.
<EOS>
When
he
had
counted
nearly
fifty
,
he
felt
safe
from
the
crash
of
the
tomahawk
.
<EOS>
Dropping
the
strange
rifle
to
the
ground
,
he
wheeled
like
a
flash
and
sighted
quickly
at
the
spot
where
he
last
saw
his
conqueror
,
but
he
had
vanished
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
XXVII
.
<EOS>
A
FAILUREThe
task
which
Jack
Carleton
took
upon
himself
,
when
he
parted
company
with
Otto
Relstaub
on
the
clearing
,
was
of
the
simplest
nature
,
and
one
which
he
was
confident
could
be
accomplished
without
trouble
;
it
was
to
reach
by
a
circuitous
course
a
point
directly
opposite
to
his
friend
,
and
on
a
line
with
the
horse
,
so
that
if
the
latter
fled
from
one
,
he
could
be
secured
by
the
other
.
<EOS>
The
experience
of
the
young
Kentuckian
averted
some
mistakes
into
which
others
might
have
fallen
.
<EOS>
One
of
the
hardest
things
for
a
hunter
to
do
,
while
tramping
the
forest
,
is
to
keep
his
bearings
.
<EOS>
There
are
few
who
have
shouldered
a
gun
that
have
not
learned
this
fact
,
and
,
without
a
compass
,
landmarks
,
the
bark
of
trees
,
or
some
other
artificial
aid
,
it
may
be
set
down
as
impossible
for
any
one
to
escape
bewilderment
.
<EOS>
If
his
wanderings
are
extended
he
will
find
himself
traveling
in
a
circle
,
and
instances
are
known
in
which
a
person
has
followed
his
own
trail
for
hours
,
without
suspecting
the
grotesque
truth
.
<EOS>
Jack
Carleton
therefore
took
every
precaution
against
going
astray
.
<EOS>
He
had
in
fact
but
one
landmark
,
so
to
speak
,
and
that
was
the
moon
,
then
well
up
in
the
sky
.
<EOS>
He
located
the
luminary
with
such
exactness
,
that
he
knew
it
would
be
directly
over
his
right
shoulder
when
he
arrived
at
a
point
precisely
opposite
his
friend
,
and
,
as
he
hoped
,
in
a
straight
line
with
the
colt
between
them
.
<EOS>
“That
means
good
luck
,
”
said
he
to
himself
,
with
a
smile
;
<EOS>
“
I
always
like
to
see
the
moon
over
my
right
shoulder
,
though
it
ca
n't
mean
anything
after
all
,
as
mother
has
told
me
many
a
time
.
<EOS>
She
said
that
she
and
father
,
a
few
nights
before
he
was
killed
by
the
Shawanoes
,
watched
the
new
moon
,
which
shone
through
the
window
,
over
his
right
shoulder
and
on
my
bare
head
.
<EOS>
Father
was
in
good
spirits
,
for
he
believed
in
signs
,
and
I
think
mother
,
though
she
chided
him
,
had
a
sly
belief
in
them
,
too
;
<EOS>
but
,
”
added
the
boy
with
a
sigh
,
“
she
shudders
now
at
the
mere
mention
of
such
a
thing
.
”While
<EOS>
Jack
was
indulging
in
this
sad
reminiscence
,
he
was
carefully
picking
his
way
among
the
trees
,
making
sure
that
he
did
not
get
the
points
of
the
compass
confused
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
call
for
haste
,
and
it
may
be
said
he
felt
every
step
of
the
way
.
<EOS>
“Otto
is
an
odd
fellow
,
”
he
muttered
,
allowing
his
fancy
to
stray
whither
it
chose
,
“
and
I
hope
he
wo
n't
become
bewildered
.
<EOS>
He
is
so
anxious
to
get
the
colt
,
that
he
will
run
into
trouble
if
there
's
any
into
which
he
can
run
.
<EOS>
He
is
shrewd
,
brave
,
and
somewhat
stupid
,
and
it
is
never
certain
what
be
will
do
or
say
.
<EOS>
Let
me
see
.
<EOS>
”He
<EOS>
stood
still
,
and
,
peeping
at
the
moon
,
as
beat
he
could
through
the
foliage
overhead
,
studied
its
position
in
the
heavens
,
with
particular
reference
to
his
own
.
<EOS>
“I
have
n't
reached
the
right
spot
yet
;
it
must
be
a
hundred
yards
further
.
<EOS>
”His
<EOS>
aim
was
to
halt
some
twenty
or
thirty
rods
beyond
the
clearing
.
<EOS>
Then
,
when
assured
he
had
gone
far
enough
,
he
would
walk
directly
toward
Otto
,
the
two
keeping
the
horse
between
them
.
<EOS>
“I
<EOS>
do
so
hope
we
will
get
him
,
”
muttered
Jack
,
beginning
to
feel
a
misgiving
now
that
the
decisive
moment
was
at
hand
,
“
for
if
we
fail
it
will
end
the
business
.
<EOS>
If
he
goes
home
without
the
colt
,
his
father
will
beat
him
,
and
more
than
likely
will
drive
him
into
the
woods
and
forbid
him
to
come
back
till
he
brings
the
horse
with
him
.
<EOS>
He
is
such
a
hard
-
hearted
,
miserly
old
fellow
,
that
he
will
accept
no
excuse
from
Otto
,
and
his
mother
does
n't
seem
to
be
much
better
.
<EOS>
”After
<EOS>
a
time
Jack
reached
the
point
where
he
found
the
moonlight
streaming
over
his
right
shoulder
.
<EOS>
Of
course
,
he
could
have
secured
that
lucky
omen
at
any
time
,
but
it
resulted
now
from
the
systematic
course
he
had
followed
,
and
he
was
sure
no
mistake
had
been
made
.
<EOS>
He
had
no
more
than
formed
the
conclusion
that
everything
was
as
it
should
be
,
when
he
was
surprised
to
hear
the
neigh
of
a
horse
within
bowshot
of
where
he
stood
.
<EOS>
As
it
came
from
the
direction
of
the
clearing
,
no
doubt
remained
that
it
was
the
animal
for
which
he
was
hunting
.
<EOS>
“It
looks
as
if
it
is
to
be
my
fortune
after
all
to
recover
the
colt
,
”
thought
the
pleased
lad
.
<EOS>
“
It
will
be
a
surprise
to
Otto
,
but
I
hope
we
shall
not
have
to
wait
any
longer
,
for
we
have
lost
a
good
deal
of
time
.
<EOS>
”He
moved
through
the
wood
,
stepping
softly
,
so
as
not
to
frighten
the
animal
,
which
probably
had
had
enough
of
liberty
to
be
unwilling
to
go
back
to
bondage
.
<EOS>
A
brief
distance
was
passed
,
when
the
young
Kentuckian
caught
sight
of
the
stray
steed
.
<EOS>
In
an
opening
,
less
than
a
tenth
of
an
acre
,
where
there
was
an
abundance
of
grass
,
stood
the
identical
colt
which
ran
away
the
day
before
.
<EOS>
Saddle
and
bridle
were
still
in
place
,
though
even
the
moonlight
was
sufficient
to
show
they
had
suffered
much
from
the
journey
of
the
horse
.
<EOS>
The
latter
,
evidently
was
suspicious
that
something
was
amiss
.
<EOS>
He
was
cropping
the
grass
,
when
the
sound
of
Jack
's
footsteps
alarmed
him
.
<EOS>
He
stood
with
his
head
up
,
the
grass
dripping
like
water
from
his
mouth
,
while
he
listened
for
the
cause
of
alarm
.
<EOS>
Jack
Carleton
was
well
aware
of
the
difficulty
that
faced
him
when
on
the
very
threshold
of
success
.
<EOS>
Though
he
was
close
to
the
animal
,
he
was
not
yet
secured
.
<EOS>
“Ah
!
<EOS>
If
Deerfoot
was
here
,
”
sighed
the
boy
,
“
then
there
would
be
no
doubt
of
the
result
,
for
he
would
dart
forward
and
catch
him
.
<EOS>
If
the
horse
wanted
to
run
away
,
he
would
let
him
do
it
,
and
then
the
Shawanoe
would
chase
him
down
,
just
as
easily
as
he
would
me
or
Otto
;
but
it
is
going
to
be
hard
work
for
me
.
<EOS>
”It
was
difficult
to
decide
on
the
best
course
of
procedure
.
<EOS>
The
sagacious
creature
would
not
only
be
quick
to
recognize
Jack
,
but
equally
quick
to
understand
his
purpose
in
approaching
him
.
<EOS>
It
was
too
much
to
expect
him
to
submit
quietly
to
recapture
.
<EOS>
Jack
softly
plucked
a
handful
of
grass
,
and
,
stepping
out
from
the
cover
of
the
woods
began
moving
gently
toward
the
colt
.
<EOS>
The
latter
turned
his
head
and
uttered
a
sniff
of
inquiry
,
at
the
same
time
showing
an
inclination
to
whirl
about
and
gallop
off
.
<EOS>
The
boy
stood
still
and
,
holding
out
the
grass
,
deftly
manipulated
it
so
that
a
part
dropped
loosely
to
the
ground
:
this
insured
its
notice
by
his
victim
.
<EOS>
Jack
also
addressed
him
in
his
most
soothing
tones
.
<EOS>
He
called
him
all
the
pet
names
at
his
command
,
and
,
as
the
steed
still
held
his
ground
,
the
youth
resumed
his
stealthy
advance
.
<EOS>
Jack
Carleton
's
heart
throbbed
with
hope
.
<EOS>
The
animal
threw
his
head
higher
,
snuffed
louder
,
and
manifestly
was
hesitating
whether
to
permit
a
closer
approach
before
fleeing
,
or
whether
to
turn
his
face
at
once
from
temptation
.
<EOS>
“A
<EOS>
few
steps
more
<EOS>
and
he
is
mine
,
”
<EOS>
was
the
thought
of
Jack
,
who
repeated
the
pet
names
with
greater
ardor
,
interspersing
them
with
a
variation
of
cluckings
and
chirpings
that
would
have
charmed
a
prattling
baby
.
<EOS>
He
increased
his
pace
,
for
he
was
almost
within
reach
,
while
the
beast
snorted
with
excitement
.
<EOS>
All
at
once
Jack
dropped
the
gun
in
his
other
hand
,
and
made
a
desperate
plunge
,
meaning
to
grasp
the
forelock
of
the
horse
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
said
that
he
succeeded
,
for
he
felt
the
coarse
,
cool
hair
as
it
was
swept
through
his
fingers
by
the
flirt
of
the
animal
's
head
.
<EOS>
Jack
missed
success
,
by
what
may
be
truly
said
to
have
been
a
hair
's
breadth
.
<EOS>
“Whoa
!
<EOS>
confound
you!”This
command
<EOS>
was
uttered
in
a
very
different
tone
from
that
in
which
he
had
been
addressing
the
colt
a
minute
before
.
<EOS>
There
was
nothing
soothing
in
it
,
and
the
animal
showed
his
contempt
by
whirling
about
,
kicking
up
his
heels
and
dashing
into
the
woods
.
<EOS>
Jack
snatched
his
gun
from
the
ground
and
bounded
after
him
at
the
imminent
risk
of
breaking
his
neck
.
<EOS>
He
was
too
far
from
Otto
and
his
captor
to
attract
attention
,
but
the
noise
may
have
reached
the
ears
of
the
Indian
.
<EOS>
The
angered
pursuer
did
not
coax
or
order
the
colt
,
for
what
he
had
done
in
that
line
was
sufficient
to
show
the
effort
was
thrown
away
.
<EOS>
He
listened
:
the
animal
was
still
going
at
a
rate
which
showed
he
believed
the
danger
was
at
his
heels
.
<EOS>
The
sound
he
made
,
while
galloping
over
the
leaves
and
through
the
bushes
,
grew
fainter
and
fainter
until
it
died
out
altogether
.
<EOS>
“I
suppose
he
will
keep
it
up
for
several
hours
.
<EOS>
If
he
faces
toward
the
settlement
,
he
will
reach
it
to
-
morrow
,
but
if
he
veers
to
the
right
or
left
,
Otto
may
as
well
give
up
the
job
.
<EOS>
”Jack
was
keenly
disappointed
,
for
he
had
been
confident
of
success
,
and
now
he
was
forced
to
admit
there
was
scarcely
a
hope
of
ever
seeing
the
colt
again
.
<EOS>
“It
<EOS>
's
a
bad
go
,
”
he
said
,
turning
about
and
moving
toward
the
clearing
,
where
he
had
left
his
friend
;
“
we
'll
keep
up
the
hunt
to
-
morrow
,
but
if
he
is
n't
caught
before
sundown
,
I
shall
insist
that
we
go
home
.
<EOS>
Mother
's
anxious
to
see
me
,
”
he
added
,
in
a
softer
voice
,
“
<EOS>
but
no
more
than
I
am
to
see
her
.
<EOS>
It
has
been
weeks
since
we
parted
,
and
if
anything
should
happen
to
her
while
I
am
loitering
by
the
way
,
I
can
never
forgive
myself
.
<EOS>
”He
<EOS>
did
not
reflect
that
he
was
exposed
to
tenfold
more
harm
than
his
parent
.
<EOS>
He
reproached
himself
that
he
had
tarried
in
Coatesville
until
Otto
came
for
him
.
<EOS>
He
was
ready
and
waiting
several
days
,
during
which
he
could
have
made
the
journey
on
foot
,
without
the
guidance
of
his
friend
.
<EOS>
However
,
it
was
too
late
now
for
regrets
,
and
he
tried
to
take
matters
philosophically
.
<EOS>
The
young
Kentuckian
made
certain
he
was
steadily
pursuing
the
right
course
,
and
,
when
he
thought
he
had
advanced
far
enough
,
he
emitted
the
whistle
agreed
upon
.
<EOS>
Of
course
no
reply
came
back
,
for
,
as
the
reader
knows
,
the
young
Teuton
for
whom
the
signal
was
meant
was
not
in
a
situation
to
make
suitable
answer
.
<EOS>
In
fact
it
did
not
reach
his
ears
at
all
.
<EOS>
Without
losing
any
more
minutes
,
Jack
Carleton
pushed
forward
,
until
he
was
brought
to
a
stand
-
still
by
catching
the
unmistakable
glimmer
of
a
light
a
short
distance
ahead
among
the
trees
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
XXVIII
.
<EOS>
THE
EAVESDROPPERNaturally
the
first
impression
of
Jack
Carleton
,
on
seeing
the
light
,
was
that
it
proceeded
from
the
fire
kindled
by
Otto
.
<EOS>
It
struck
him
as
curious
that
he
should
do
so
before
be
could
be
certain
the
horse
was
captured
;
but
,
in
accordance
with
his
training
,
Jack
took
nothing
for
granted
.
<EOS>
A
few
guarded
steps
,
and
he
discovered
the
truth
;
the
light
was
much
closer
than
he
suspected
,
and
came
through
a
slight
rent
in
the
side
of
an
Indian
wigwam
.
<EOS>
The
young
Kentuckian
was
astounded
,
for
he
had
never
dreamed
of
anything
of
the
kind
.
<EOS>
He
concluded
he
must
be
on
the
confines
of
an
Indian
village
,
and
made
a
further
investigation
;
but
it
did
not
take
long
to
learn
that
the
lodge
stood
alone
in
the
great
forest
.
<EOS>
“I
suppose
some
chieftain
or
warrior
has
quarreled
with
his
people
and
lives
by
himself
,
”
was
the
remarkably
accurate
guess
of
the
boy
;
“
I
do
n't
know
how
he
feels
toward
white
folks
,
but
I
'll
take
a
little
further
look
and
then
hunt
up
Otto
.
<EOS>
”He
<EOS>
could
not
fail
to
note
that
the
lodge
stood
close
to
the
clearing
where
he
had
agreed
to
meet
his
friend
,
and
he
was
unable
to
free
himself
of
a
dread
,
while
stealing
forward
for
the
purpose
of
peeping
through
the
rent
in
the
side
of
the
aboriginal
structure
.
<EOS>
Otto
must
have
seen
the
wigwam
before
reaching
it
,
though
the
proprietor
might
have
been
quicker
in
detecting
the
approach
of
a
stranger
.
<EOS>
Fully
sensible
of
the
care
required
,
Jack
advanced
slowly
,
without
noise
,
feeling
every
inch
of
the
way
.
<EOS>
At
last
he
was
able
to
bend
forward
and
peep
through
the
slight
opening
,
which
first
told
him
of
the
location
of
the
wigwam
.
<EOS>
It
required
some
delicate
maneuvering
to
gain
a
good
view
of
the
interior
,
and
it
need
not
be
said
that
the
result
was
of
the
most
interesting
nature
.
<EOS>
His
eyes
,
or
rather
eye
(
inasmuch
as
he
used
only
one
)
,
first
rested
on
the
dusky
baby
,
that
had
managed
to
kick
off
the
blanket
,
and
was
fiercely
tugging
at
the
piece
of
cooked
venison
which
his
dusky
mother
bad
tossed
him
.
<EOS>
He
held
it
between
his
scant
teeth
,
grasping
it
with
his
chubby
hands
,
while
his
feet
beat
the
air
,
occasionally
catching
under
his
chin
,
as
though
he
was
using
hands
and
feet
to
force
the
meat
apart
.
<EOS>
He
worked
his
legs
with
such
a
vigor
that
at
times
he
seemed
in
danger
of
making
a
back
somersault
and
bumping
through
the
side
of
the
lodge
.
<EOS>
Under
other
circumstances
Jack
Carleton
would
have
laughed
outright
at
the
comical
figure
of
the
bright
-
eyed
infant
;
but
the
sight
of
Otto
Relstaub
checked
all
such
feeling
,
and
deepened
the
alarm
which
came
with
the
first
sight
of
the
wigwam
.
<EOS>
It
so
happened
that
Jack
was
much
closer
to
his
friend
than
he
was
to
any
of
the
other
three
figures
.
<EOS>
No
more
than
two
feet
separated
the
boys
,
and
in
peering
into
the
lodge
,
the
eavesdropper
looked
directly
over
the
head
and
shoulders
of
Otto
.
<EOS>
The
familiar
peaked
hat
,
which
had
not
been
removed
,
the
rather
long
,
curling
hair
,
the
round
,
rosy
check
,
broad
shoulders
,
the
tip
of
the
pug
nose
,
the
plump
chin
,
the
feet
,
and
the
arms
resting
idly
on
the
drawn
-
up
knees
—
all
these
made
the
young
German
look
like
an
exaggerated
fairy
,
that
had
dropped
in
on
some
superstitious
mortals
and
was
regaling
them
with
tales
of
wonderland
.
<EOS>
But
Otto
was
not
discoursing
to
listeners
;
he
was
looking
from
one
to
the
other
,
sometimes
smiling
at
the
snuffing
,
kicking
,
clawing
infant
,
and
then
assuming
an
anxious
expression
,
when
his
eyes
rested
on
the
face
of
the
others
who
shared
the
lodge
with
him
.
<EOS>
The
squaw
was
slowly
drawing
in
and
exhaling
the
vapor
from
her
pipe
,
with
the
deliberate
enjoyment
of
an
old
smoker
.
<EOS>
With
her
elbows
on
her
knees
,
she
stared
fixedly
at
Otto
,
who
must
have
been
annoyed
by
her
persistency
.
<EOS>
Wish
-
o
-
wa
-
tum
,
the
Man
-
not
-
Afraid
-
of
-
Thunder
,
occupied
his
throne
of
bison
skin
on
the
other
side
of
the
wigwam
,
and
,
having
tired
of
sitting
erect
as
became
a
monarch
,
was
lounging
on
his
right
elbow
,
leaving
his
left
hand
free
to
manipulate
his
pipe
,
which
was
occasionally
taken
from
his
lips
,
after
the
cheeks
were
filled
to
overflowing
with
pungent
vapor
.
<EOS>
Then
,
forming
his
immense
mouth
into
a
contracted
circle
,
be
ejected
the
smoke
with
his
doubled
tongue
,
sending
forth
ring
after
ring
,
in
any
direction
he
chose
.
<EOS>
Looking
up
at
the
opening
in
the
top
of
the
lodge
,
he
started
a
regular
procession
of
blue
circles
,
twisting
inward
and
slowly
expanding
as
they
climbed
toward
the
fresh
air
,
where
they
were
suddenly
caught
and
whirled
into
nothingness
.
<EOS>
Jack
had
the
best
view
of
the
chieftain
he
could
wish
,
and
fearful
of
being
detected
,
drew
his
head
back
a
few
inches
so
as
to
be
in
entire
darkness
,
and
studied
the
ugly
countenance
.
<EOS>
He
observed
the
small
,
piggish
eyes
far
apart
,
the
big
cheek
bones
,
the
disfigured
nose
,
the
enormous
mouth
,
the
slouchy
,
untidy
dress
,
and
even
the
half
dozen
straggling
hairs
that
sprouted
here
and
there
over
his
massive
chin
.
<EOS>
He
noticed
the
flitting
glances
of
the
black
eyes
,
and
knew
that
the
unattractive
Indian
had
,
in
some
way
or
other
,
made
a
prisoner
of
Otto
Relstaub
,
whose
rifle
was
missing
.
<EOS>
Standing
on
the
outside
with
his
loaded
gun
in
hand
,
the
young
Kentuckian
could
have
done
as
he
pleased
with
the
red
man
,
who
had
no
suspicions
of
danger
;
but
the
thought
of
shooting
him
was
unspeakably
shocking
to
Jack
,
who
could
not
have
been
persuaded
to
the
step
unless
forced
to
do
so
,
in
order
to
save
the
life
of
Otto
or
himself
.
<EOS>
Cruel
indeed
must
any
one
be
who
could
look
on
the
picture
of
domestic
happiness
,
the
stolid
father
,
the
contented
mother
,
and
the
lusty
youngster
,
without
feeling
his
heart
stirred
by
that
deep
,
inborn
sympathy
which
makes
the
whole
world
akin
.
<EOS>
“He
<EOS>
is
n't
a
Shawanoe
or
Miami
,
”
was
the
conclusion
of
Jack
,
after
a
careful
study
of
the
warrior
's
face
and
general
appearance
;
“
I
have
never
seen
an
Osage
,
but
have
heard
much
of
them
,
and
I
'm
quite
sure
he
is
one
.
<EOS>
If
that
is
so
,
he
is
n't
as
fierce
as
his
race
on
the
other
side
the
Mississippi
,
and
I
think
we
can
get
Otto
out
of
there
without
harm
to
any
one
.
<EOS>
If
we
are
going
to
live
in
this
part
of
the
world
,
we
must
keep
on
good
terms
with
the
Indians
.
<EOS>
Helloa
!
<EOS>
what
is
the
old
fellow
going
to
do?”Jack
noticed
that
the
head
of
the
family
had
stopped
glancing
from
one
part
of
the
lodge
to
another
,
and
was
looking
steadily
at
Otto
,
as
if
he
meditated
some
design
against
him
.
<EOS>
And
so
he
did
.
<EOS>
Drawing
in
an
enormous
quantity
of
smoke
,
he
removed
the
stem
from
his
leathern
lips
,
contracted
them
into
another
O
,
and
suddenly
shot
out
a
vapory
ring
,
followed
instantly
by
a
second
,
third
and
fourth
,
and
then
by
so
many
that
they
stumbled
over
each
other
's
heels
,
as
may
be
said
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
the
mouth
of
Wish
-
a
-
wa
-
tum
seemed
to
have
become
a
mitrailleue
for
the
moment
,
that
sent
a
continuous
volley
across
the
wigwam
.
<EOS>
When
the
bombardment
opened
,
Otto
was
looking
thoughtfully
at
the
ground
in
the
middle
of
the
lodge
,
so
that
his
face
was
turned
toward
the
chieftain
.
<EOS>
The
latter
aimed
with
such
skill
that
,
as
he
intended
,
the
first
ring
passed
directly
over
the
end
of
Otto
's
pug
nose
,
which
for
the
instant
looked
as
though
some
painter
had
enclosed
the
organ
in
a
delicately
tinted
circle
.
<EOS>
The
latter
was
no
more
than
in
place
,
when
it
was
followed
by
several
others
.
<EOS>
The
series
,
however
,
was
blown
into
nothingness
by
a
resounding
sneeze
from
Otto
,
which
started
the
vapor
toward
the
opening
above
,
that
seemed
to
exert
a
greater
power
as
the
distance
from
the
ground
increased
.
<EOS>
When
within
a
few
inches
of
the
outlet
,
the
smoke
flew
apart
,
spun
around
and
whisked
out
of
sight
,
with
the
current
that
was
borne
upward
from
every
part
of
the
lodge
.
<EOS>
“Donderation
!
”
exclaimed
Otto
as
best
he
could
,
through
the
strangling
vapor
;
“
what
for
you
do
n't
do
dot
?
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
vants
to
kill
somepodys
<EOS>
mit
<EOS>
your
smoke
—
don't
it
?
<EOS>
Yaw
I
oogh!”Man
-
not
-
Afraid
-
of
-
Thunder
did
not
stir
.
<EOS>
Still
holding
his
pipe
suspended
in
his
left
hand
,
he
looked
at
the
discomfited
youth
and
smiled
.
<EOS>
The
smile
was
the
most
prodigious
on
which
Jack
Carleton
had
ever
looked
.
<EOS>
He
saw
the
corners
of
the
mouth
move
back
on
the
cheeks
until
it
seemed
they
must
touch
the
ears
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
the
chief
smiled
so
seldom
that
the
few
served
to
bring
up
the
“
general
average
”
of
those
that
were
lacking
.
<EOS>
Wish
-
o
-
wa
-
tum
could
have
added
to
the
distress
of
Otto
by
continuing
his
vapory
cannonade
,
but
he
refrained
,
and
amused
himself
by
sending
the
rings
once
more
toward
the
chimney
.
<EOS>
While
this
little
episode
was
going
on
,
the
squaw
,
with
her
chin
on
her
hands
and
her
elbows
on
her
knees
,
continued
to
stare
at
Otto
;
but
she
showed
no
disposition
to
smile
even
in
the
slightest
degree
.
<EOS>
In
her
the
element
of
mirth
appeared
to
be
totally
lacking
.
<EOS>
It
is
more
than
probable
that
she
had
not
acquired
the
art
of
ejecting
the
circles
of
smoke
,
or
she
would
have
followed
up
the
exhibition
of
her
husband
with
a
similar
one
,
inspired
thereto
by
the
innate
ugliness
of
her
nature
.
<EOS>
The
incident
described
did
much
to
dissipate
the
alarm
of
Jack
Carleton
for
his
friend
.
<EOS>
The
overwhelming
smile
on
the
countenance
of
the
chieftain
made
it
attractive
,
for
it
was
free
from
the
disfigurement
of
hate
.
<EOS>
“Yes
,
he
is
an
Osage
,
with
his
wife
and
little
one
.
<EOS>
He
may
not
be
a
pleasant
neighbor
,
but
he
would
not
dare
to
live
away
from
his
tribe
,
if
he
was
as
cruel
as
the
Shawanoes
or
Hurons
.
<EOS>
Some
of
the
settlers
would
shoot
him
and
his
squaw
and
papoose
.
<EOS>
”This
<EOS>
theory
was
reasonable
,
but
from
the
nature
of
the
case
it
could
not
be
complete
in
the
assurance
it
brought
to
the
mind
of
the
young
Kentuckian
,
inasmuch
as
it
failed
to
explain
several
alarming
facts
.
<EOS>
In
the
first
place
,
Otto
,
manifestly
,
was
a
prisoner
in
the
lodge
.
<EOS>
He
had
no
gun
with
which
to
defend
himself
,
nor
could
the
guarded
peeping
of
the
eavesdropper
discover
the
weapon
within
the
wigwam
.
<EOS>
In
what
manner
the
German
had
fallen
into
the
power
of
the
Osage
was
beyond
conjecture
,
nor
could
Jack
guess
the
ultimate
intentions
of
the
captor
.
<EOS>
“I
have
my
loaded
gun
,
”
was
the
thought
of
the
youth
,
“
and
I
ought
to
be
able
to
get
Otto
out
of
this
scrape
.
<EOS>
I
shall
be
sorry
,
indeed
,
to
harm
any
one
in
the
wigwam
,
and
so
long
as
it
is
possible
to
avoid
it
,
I
will
.
<EOS>
If
the
warrior
receives
injury
it
will
be
his
own
fault
.
<EOS>
”At
<EOS>
such
times
,
the
most
curious
fancies
often
take
possession
of
a
person
.
<EOS>
Jack
Carleton
had
convinced
himself
that
the
Indian
,
wigwam
was
the
only
one
in
the
neighborhood
;
but
he
had
scarcely
decided
what
his
course
should
be
,
when
he
began
to
fear
he
had
made
a
mistake
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
unlikely
that
a
single
Osage
should
dwell
apart
from
his
tribe
in
that
fashion
.
<EOS>
“There
must
be
other
lodges
near
me
,
”
he
thought
,
stepping
softly
back
and
peering
around
in
the
gloom
.
<EOS>
It
mattered
not
that
he
saw
no
lights
from
any
of
them
,
for
he
reasoned
that
they
might
be
hidden
by
the
intervening
trees
.
<EOS>
So
strong
was
the
feeling
,
that
he
moved
further
off
and
repeated
the
very
reconnaissance
made
a
short
time
previous
.
<EOS>
He
would
not
have
done
so
,
had
he
not
known
that
Otto
was
in
no
immediate
danger
from
his
captor
.
<EOS>
Had
the
latter
offered
him
harm
,
the
struggle
would
have
been
heard
in
the
stillness
of
the
night
,
and
Jack
would
have
rushed
to
the
relief
of
his
friend
.
<EOS>
Finally
,
the
eavesdropper
became
satisfied
that
whatever
the
issue
of
the
strange
situation
,
he
had
<EOS>
but
the
single
family
to
face
.
<EOS>
Then
he
was
distressed
by
the
doubt
as
to
what
the
squaw
would
do
,
it
he
carried
out
his
scheme
.
<EOS>
It
is
well
,
known
that
the
Indian
women
are
as
brave
,
and
frequently
more
cruel
,
toward
their
captives
than
are
the
warriors
themselves
.
<EOS>
If
the
one
before
him
became
violent
,
Jack
would
be
likely
to
find
he
had
undertaken
a
task
beyond
his
power
.
<EOS>
His
determination
was
to
walk
directly
into
the
lodge
and
act
as
if
he
believed
the
occupants
were
his
friends
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
strode
forward
toward
the
entrance
,
purposely
kicking
the
leaves
with
his
feet
;
and
it
was
that
noise
which
apprised
those
within
of
his
approach
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
XXIX
.
<EOS>
WITHIN
THE
WIGWAMJack
Carleton
walked
to
the
flapping
deerskin
which
closed
the
entrance
to
the
wigwam
,
flung
it
aside
,
and
,
stooping
slightly
,
stepped
within
.
<EOS>
Looking
into
the
face
of
Wish
-
o
-
wa
-
tum
,
he
made
a
half
military
salute
and
,
straightening
up
,
called
out:“How
<EOS>
do
you
do
,
brother?”The
etiquette
of
the
visitor
required
him
to
advance
and
offer
his
hand
,
but
he
was
afraid
to
do
so
while
in
doubt
as
to
the
sentiments
of
the
chief
.
<EOS>
The
young
Kentuckian
recalled
an
instance
somewhat
similar
to
the
present
,
wherein
a
Huron
warrior
,
grasping
the
hand
of
the
white
man
who
offered
it
,
suddenly
drew
him
forward
and
plunged
his
hunting
-
knife
into
his
side
.
<EOS>
The
unexpected
visit
of
Jack
produced
a
sensation
amounting
,
for
the
moment
,
almost
to
consternation
.
<EOS>
For
the
first
time
the
squaw
showed
genuine
surprise
.
<EOS>
Snapping
the
pipe
from
her
mouth
,
she
threw
up
her
head
with
a
grunt
,
and
stared
at
the
athletic
youth
.
<EOS>
The
kicking
baby
on
the
hearth
appeared
to
understand
that
something
unusual
was
going
on
,
and
held
arms
and
legs
still
,
while
he
stared
,
with
his
round
black
eyes
,
toward
the
figure
at
the
other
end
of
the
lodge
.
<EOS>
Man
-
not
-
Afraid
-
of
-
Thunder
turned
his
head
,
holding
his
pipe
in
hand
,
and
looked
inquiringly
at
the
visitor
.
<EOS>
He
showed
no
signs
of
fear
,
but
,
manifestly
,
he
was
astonished
.
<EOS>
His
fragmentary
conversation
with
the
other
boy
had
given
him
no
cause
to
look
for
such
a
call
,
though
he
saw
at
a
glance
that
the
two
were
friends
.
<EOS>
Otto
Relstaub
beamed
with
delight
.
<EOS>
With
an
expanse
of
smile
second
only
to
that
of
which
the
sachem
was
capable
,
he
rose
partly
to
his
feet
and
,
looking
at
Jack
,
called
out:“Mine
gracious
!
<EOS>
Jack
,
I
did
n't
look
for
nodings
of
you
pefore
,
as
dot
ish—”“Hold
on
!
”
<EOS>
interposed
the
lad
at
the
door
,
with
a
laugh
and
wave
of
the
hand
,
“
sit
down
and
compose
yourself
till
you
can
talk
straighter
than
that
.
<EOS>
”“I
dinks
I
does
—
yaw
,
”
muttered
the
happy
fellow
,
willing
to
do
anything
suggested
by
his
companion
;
“
but
come
in
and
sot
down
.
<EOS>
”While
<EOS>
addressing
Otto
,
Jack
kept
his
eyes
on
Wish
-
o
-
wa
-
tum
,
for
it
may
be
said
he
was
the
key
of
the
situation
.
<EOS>
If
he
showed
hostility
,
trouble
was
sure
to
follow
.
<EOS>
Jack
half
expected
to
see
him
make
a
leap
for
his
bow
or
rifle
,
or
attempt
to
draw
his
tomahawk
.
<EOS>
If
he
does
thought
the
boy
,
“
I
'll
raise
my
gun
first
,
and
he
will
understand
what
that
means
.
<EOS>
”But
<EOS>
the
looks
and
manner
of
the
host
(
if
such
he
may
be
called
)
were
neither
hostile
nor
friendly
;
they
were
indifferent
,
as
though
the
whole
business
possessed
no
interest
to
him
.
<EOS>
After
his
first
surprised
stare
,
he
swung
his
head
back
to
its
former
position
and
slowly
smoked
his
pipe
as
before
.
<EOS>
Jack
Carleton
made
up
his
mind
on
the
moment
that
his
true
course
was
to
carry
out
his
first
idea
that
is
,
to
act
as
though
there
was
no
doubt
of
the
friendship
of
the
Osage
.
<EOS>
Stepping
to
the
left
,
he
set
his
gun
on
the
ground
with
the
muzzle
leaning
against
the
side
of
the
lodge
.
<EOS>
No
more
expressive
sign
of
comity
could
have
been
given
than
this
simple
act
.
<EOS>
He
then
advanced
to
the
beefy
,
stolid
chieftain
,
to
whom
he
offered
his
hand
,
repeating
the
words:“How
<EOS>
do
you
do
,
brother?”Wish
<EOS>
-
o
-
wa
-
tum
took
the
fingers
in
his
own
immense
palm
,
and
gave
them
a
moderate
pressure
.
<EOS>
Though
it
might
have
been
called
a
warm
salute
,
it
sent
a
shiver
through
the
youth
,
who
unconsciously
braced
himself
against
any
sudden
pull
of
the
savage
,
his
other
hand
,
at
the
same
time
,
vaguely
seeking
the
handle
of
his
knife
.
<EOS>
But
,
whatever
thoughts
or
intentions
may
have
stirred
the
massive
chieftain
,
they
gave
no
evidence
of
their
nature
in
his
face
.
<EOS>
He
looked
up
at
the
boy
,
and
,
as
he
slightly
wabbled
the
hand
within
his
own
<EOS>
,
said:“How
do
,
brudder?”Jack
then
turned
about
and
greeted
Otto
,
who
could
scarcely
contain
himself
.
<EOS>
The
movement
,
it
will
be
noticed
,
placed
the
back
of
the
former
toward
the
chief
,
and
he
was
conscious
of
another
chill
running
up
and
down
his
spine
;
for
no
better
opportunity
could
be
given
the
Indian
to
strike
one
of
those
treacherous
,
lightning
-
like
blows
peculiar
to
the
savage
races
.
<EOS>
“Keep
<EOS>
your
eye
on
him
,
”
said
Jack
,
in
an
undertone
,
while
shaking
the
hand
of
Otto
,
and
both
were
talking
loud
and
effusively
.
<EOS>
Otto
nodded
his
head
and
winked
,
to
signify
he
caught
on
,
and
did
not
check
,
for
a
single
moment
,
his
rattling
flow
of
talk
.
<EOS>
Jack
,
in
the
most
natural
manner
,
shifted
his
position
to
one
side
,
so
he
was
able
to
look
upon
every
one
in
the
wigwam
without
the
appearance
of
any
special
object
in
doing
so
.
<EOS>
The
great
point
with
the
callers
was
to
secure
the
good
-
will
of
the
savages
.
<EOS>
It
may
seem
shrewd
on
their
part
,
but
any
boy
,
no
matter
what
his
age
,
knows
that
the
surest
way
to
win
the
friendship
of
a
household
is
to
magnify
the
importance
of
the
baby
.
<EOS>
The
thought
occurred
to
Otto
long
before
,
and
more
than
once
he
explored
his
garments
in
search
of
some
present
for
the
youngster
;
but
he
possessed
nothing
that
would
answer
.
<EOS>
His
pockets
were
empty
of
anything
in
the
shape
of
coin
,
bright
medals
,
buttons
,
or
playthings
of
any
sort
likely
to
attract
the
eye
of
the
aboriginal
American
infant
.
<EOS>
He
might
have
handed
his
hunting
-
knife
to
him
,
but
more
than
likely
,
in
his
blind
striking
and
kicking
,
he
would
gouge
out
an
eye
or
attempt
to
scalp
himself
,
and
then
the
mother
would
turn
upon
the
donor
in
her
wrath
.
<EOS>
Otto
considered
the
project
of
borrowing
the
tomahawk
of
the
chief
and
passing
it
over
to
the
heir
,
but
feared
he
would
knock
out
his
own
brains
or
do
something
desperate
,
by
which
retribution
would
be
visited
on
the
head
of
Otto
.
<EOS>
But
Jack
Carleton
was
more
fortunate
,
for
in
the
pocket
of
his
trousers
<EOS>
was
an
English
shilling
,
worn
smooth
and
shining
with
the
friction
to
which
it
had
been
long
subjected
.
<EOS>
It
was
just
the
thing
to
catch
the
eye
of
any
baby
,
no
matter
what
its
nativity
,
and
he
stepped
hastily
forward
and
handed
it
to
the
one
before
him
.
<EOS>
The
movement
interested
the
parents
scarcely
less
than
the
child
.
<EOS>
They
watched
Jack
closely
.
<EOS>
The
little
fellow
snatched
the
bright
coin
in
his
snuffling
,
awkward
fashion
,
and
,
when
it
was
clutched
in
his
fingers
,
made
a
furious
shove
,
intending
to
drive
it
into
his
mouth
.
<EOS>
“Hold
on
,
”
called
Jack
,
in
alarm
;
“
I
did
n't
give
it
to
you
to
eat
;
I
do
n't
believe
you
can
digest
it
.
<EOS>
”Just
<EOS>
then
the
little
fellow
began
to
kick
,
cough
,
and
fling
himself
harder
than
ever
.
<EOS>
The
mother
sprang
forward
with
an
exclamation
in
her
native
tongue
,
and
,
catching
her
baby
in
her
arms
,
began
manipulating
him
in
the
most
original
fashion
.
<EOS>
Standing
upright
in
the
middle
of
the
wigwam
,
she
inverted
him
,
and
,
holding
him
by
the
heels
,
worked
him
up
and
down
,
as
though
he
were
the
dasher
of
a
chum
.
<EOS>
“If
<EOS>
she
do
n't
do
dot
a
leedle
<EOS>
harder
his
head
vill
bounce
off
,
”
remarked
Otto
.
<EOS>
The
shilling
flew
from
the
throat
of
the
baby
,
and
Jack
,
thinking
it
had
done
enough
harm
,
scooped
over
to
pick
it
up
;
but
,
before
he
could
lay
hands
on
it
,
the
mother
snatched
it
from
the
ground
and
shoved
it
into
one
of
the
capacious
receptacles
of
her
dress
.
<EOS>
Evidently
she
identified
the
coin
and
knew
its
value
.
<EOS>
“All
<EOS>
right
,
”
laughed
Jack
;
“
I
'll
be
glad
to
have
you
keep
it
,
if
it
will
help
to
buy
your
friendship
for
us
.
<EOS>
”During
<EOS>
this
stirring
episode
,
and
when
the
boys
feared
the
heir
of
the
wigwam
was
likely
to
choke
himself
to
death
,
the
father
never
ceased
smoking
,
his
pipe
.
<EOS>
His
piggish
eyes
were
turned
sideways
,
as
though
he
thought
the
performance
worth
looking
at
;
but
,
beyond
that
,
he
did
not
disturb
himself
.
<EOS>
The
infant
,
after
his
unpleasant
experience
,
seemed
to
be
as
well
as
ever
,
and
being
tumbled
back
on
the
bison
skin
resumed
his
kicking
and
,
crowing
,
as
though
seeking
to
make
up
for
lost
time
.
<EOS>
The
occurrence
produced
an
effect
on
Jack
Carleton
similar
to
that
caused
by
the
sight
of
the
expansive
smile
of
the
Osage
chieftain
:
he
felt
that
no
dangerous
ill
-
will
could
exist
wigwam
which
was
the
scene
of
the
incident
.
<EOS>
The
boys
resumed
their
seats
beside
each
other
,
where
the
other
occupants
of
the
lodge
were
in
sight
all
the
time
,
and
then
spoke
with
freedom
.
<EOS>
“I
<EOS>
do
n't
think
they
will
,
offer
any
harm
,
”
Jack
,
alluding
,
of
course
,
to
the
squaw
and
the
warrior
.
<EOS>
I
suspect
he
is
an
Osage
.
<EOS>
”“Yaw
—
<EOS>
dot
ish
vot
<EOS>
he
tolds
me
,
”
said
Otto
carefully
weighing
his
words
.
<EOS>
“What
else
<EOS>
did
he
tell
you
?
<EOS>
But
,
first
of
all
,
let
me
know
how
you
came
to
be
his
guest
.
”Thereupon
<EOS>
the
German
related
,
in
his
own
fashion
,
the
story
which
long
since
became
familiar
to
the
reader
.
<EOS>
Jack
Carleton
listened
with
much
interest
,
glancing
from
the
husband
to
the
wife
and
back
again
,
with
an
occasional
look
at
the
baby
,
that
had
become
so
motionless
as
to
show
that
he
was
asleep
.
<EOS>
“So
<EOS>
you
did
n't
get
anything
to
eat
?
”
<EOS>
remarked
the
young
Kentuckian
;
“
when
I
first
saw
you
here
I
thought
you
were
after
food
.
<EOS>
I
am
hungry
,
but
I
think
the
best
thing
we
can
do
is
to
leave
the
lodge
.
<EOS>
”“Vy
<EOS>
not
stays
till
mornings?”“It
might
do
;
but
I
'm
a
little
too
nervous
to
sleep
,
for
there
can
be
no
certainty
about
them
.
<EOS>
I
hunted
around
for
other
lodges
,
but
found
none
,
and
yet
there
may
be
plenty
not
far
off
.
<EOS>
He
may
have
visitors
,
and
,
if
they
find
us
here
,
there
's
no
telling
what
they
will
do
.
<EOS>
”“What
<EOS>
for
you
leave
your
gun
ober
dere
just
as
I
does
mit
mine?”“It
struck
me
that
that
was
the
best
way
to
show
the
old
fellow
that
not
only
was
I
friendly
myself
,
but
that
I
took
him
to
be
a
friend
.
<EOS>
”“Dot
ish
<EOS>
so
<EOS>
;
but
it
would
be
as
nice
as
nefet
vos
<EOS>
if
bofe
of
our
guns
had
us
.
<EOS>
”“I
will
get
mine
.
”“Mebbe
<EOS>
he
wo
n't
lets
you
.
<EOS>
”“I'm
<EOS>
almost
as
close
to
it
as
he
<EOS>
;
I
can
take
a
step
or
two
before
he
will
see
what
I
mean
to
do
,
and
then
,
if
he
undertakes
to
stop
me
,
he
will
be
too
late
.
<EOS>
”“Vot
<EOS>
musn't
<EOS>
I
does?”“Attend
to
the
squaw
:
if
she
makes
a
dive
after
me
,
you
grab
and
hold
her
.
<EOS>
”“Yaw
<EOS>
,
”
was
the
hesitating
response
of
Otto
,
who
saw
what
unpleasant
phases
the
situation
was
likely
to
assume
.
<EOS>
Before
Jack
Carleton
rose
to
his
feet
,
he
discovered
that
something
extraordinary
was
going
on
in
the
lodge
.
<EOS>
Although
the
chief
was
sitting
in
his
lazy
attitude
,
yet
his
senses
were
on
the
alert
and
some
sort
of
telegraphy
was
passing
between
him
and
his
wife
.
<EOS>
Both
continued
smoking
their
pipes
and
did
not
speak
nor
move
their
bodies
.
<EOS>
Any
one
unable
to
see
their
faces
would
not
suspect
they
were
looking
at
each
other
.
<EOS>
But
they
were
not
only
doing
so
,
but
,
singular
as
it
may
seem
,
were
sending
messages
mainly
by
means
of
the
smoke
issuing
from
their
dusky
lips
.
<EOS>
It
was
puffed
forth
,
in
every
variety
of
manner
,
sometimes
with
little
short
jets
,
then
with
longer
ones
,
then
from
one
corner
of
the
mouth
and
again
from
the
other
,
all
being
accompanied
by
a
contortion
of
the
flexible
lips
which
doubtless
suggested
some
of
the
words
in
the
minds
of
the
two
.
<EOS>
“That
's
very
strange
,
”
said
Jack
,
in
an
undertone
,
after
he
and
Otto
had
watched
the
performance
several
minutes
.
<EOS>
“Yaw
,
dot
ish
vot
<EOS>
I
dinks
.
<EOS>
”“Why
<EOS>
do
they
affect
all
that
mystery
?
<EOS>
If
they
want
to
say
anything
to
each
other
,
why
not
speak
in
their
own
tongue
?
<EOS>
Neither
of
us
can
understand
the
first
word
.
<EOS>
”“But
<EOS>
they
does
n't
knows
dot
.
<EOS>
”“They
ought
to
know
it
.
<EOS>
However
,
we
ca
n't
guess
what
they
're
talking
about
,
though
I
would
give
much
to
know
.
<EOS>
”Husband
<EOS>
and
wife
were
quick
to
observe
they
were
under
scrutiny
,
but
they
continued
the
curious
interchange
of
thoughts
for
some
time
longer
.
<EOS>
By
and
by
they
ceased
and
seemed
be
doing
nothing
beside
smoking
;
Carleton
was
right
in
his
belief
that
the
sachem
had
heard
something
on
the
outside
wigwam
which
greatly
interested
them
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
XXX
.
<EOS>
AN
UNWELCOME
VISITORBoth
Jack
Carleton
and
Otto
Relstaub
were
disturbed
by
the
singular
behavior
of
the
squaw
and
chief
.
<EOS>
“They're
talking
about
something
outdoors
,
”
whispered
Jack
;
“
keep
quiet
and
listen
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
faint
rustling
of
the
leaves
,
the
gentle
breathing
of
the
sleeping
infant
,
and
the
soft
purring
of
the
fire
(
caused
by
<EOS>
the
sudden
flaring
up
of
one
of
the
brands
)
,
were
the
only
sounds
that
came
to
their
ears
.
<EOS>
Wish
-
o
-
wa
-
tum
held
the
stem
of
his
pipe
between
his
lips
,
without
ejecting
any
smoke
,
while
his
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
ground
in
front
of
his
feet
,
with
that
absent
expression
which
showed
he
was
listening
intently
to
something
not
visible
to
the
eye
.
<EOS>
The
attitude
of
the
wife
was
similar
,
except
that
she
looked
steadily
in
the
face
of
Jack
Carleton
,
as
though
seeking
to
read
his
thoughts
.
<EOS>
Hark
!
<EOS>
both
the
boys
caught
a
stirring
of
the
leaves
,
precisely
as
if
made
by
the
foot
of
an
animal
prowling
around
the
wigwam
.
<EOS>
“Sh
!
”
warned
Jack
;
“
it
's
a
man
or
<EOS>
beast!”The
words
had
no
more
than
left
his
lips
,
when
the
flapping
deerskin
was
silently
drawn
backward
and
an
Indian
warrior
entered
.
<EOS>
He
was
powerful
and
well
formed
in
his
war
paint
,
and
with
his
long
rifle
in
his
right
hand
.
<EOS>
He
had
no
blanket
thrown
over
his
shoulders
,
but
he
was
fully
dressed
in
other
respects
,
with
knife
and
tomahawk
thrust
in
the
girdle
around
his
waist
.
<EOS>
The
first
glance
showed
that
he
not
only
belonged
to
the
Shawanoe
tribe
,
but
he
was
one
of
the
most
dreaded
members
of
the
same
.
<EOS>
Both
Otto
and
Jack
had
seen
him
before
,
his
forehead
and
cheeks
being
so
curiously
marked
as
to
identify
him
wherever
no
one
else
was
similarly
ornamented
.
<EOS>
When
the
boys
were
making
their
desperate
run
for
the
shelter
of
the
logs
on
the
other
side
,
of
the
Mississippi
,
Otto
threw
back
an
affrighted
look
,
which
gave
him
such
a
vivid
picture
of
that
particular
savage
that
he
felt
the
memory
would
remain
with
him
through
life
.
<EOS>
A
few
minutes
after
,
as
my
reader
will
recall
,
Jack
deliberately
held
fast
to
the
upper
edge
of
the
rude
fort
and
looked
over
upon
the
fierce
warriors
outside
.
<EOS>
The
one
who
particularly
impressed
him
was
the
Shawanoe
with
the
hideously
painted
countenance
.
<EOS>
It
was
this
same
Indian
that
flung
the
bear
skin
about
his
shoulders
and
,
creeping
up
the
inclined
tree
trunk
,
surveyed
the
astonished
youths
below
,
and
it
was
he
who
now
entered
the
lodge
of
Wish
-
o
-
wa
-
tum
and
confronted
the
inmates
.
<EOS>
The
truth
flashed
upon
the
boys
:
he
was
one
of
a
party
that
had
followed
them
across
the
Mississippi
,
and
had
traced
them
to
this
lodge
.
<EOS>
It
was
natural
the
youths
should
believe
that
others
were
not
far
off
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
remembered
that
Otto
had
left
his
gun
on
the
edge
of
the
clearing
some
distance
away
,
while
the
weapon
of
Jack
stood
near
the
entrance
of
the
lodge
.
<EOS>
The
instant
the
Shawanoe
stepped
inside
,
his
eye
rested
on
it
,
and
,
as
if
divining
the
truth
,
he
extended
his
hand
and
picked
it
up
.
<EOS>
The
act
gave
him
two
guns
,
while
neither
of
the
boys
possessed
a
fire
-
arm
.
<EOS>
Having
performed
this
clever
exploit
,
the
Shawanoe
,
still
standing
erect
,
just
within
the
lodge
,
turned
to
the
chief
and
addressed
him
in
what
may
be
termed
a
mixture
of
the
Shawanoe
and
Osage
tongues
.
<EOS>
He
paid
no
attention
to
the
squaw
at
the
other
end
of
the
wigwam
,
for
to
an
American
Indian
the
native
woman
is
of
little
account
under
any
circumstances
.
<EOS>
Nor
did
his
face
indicate
that
he
was
aware
of
the
presence
of
the
boys
,
who
looked
at
him
with
dismay
;
but
it
was
morally
certain
that
the
conversation
which
opened
immediately
related
almost
solely
to
them
.
<EOS>
“My
gracious
!
”
<EOS>
said
Jack
,
when
able
to
recover
himself
,
“
this
is
bad
for
us
.
<EOS>
I
never
dreamed
of
anything
of
the
kind
.
<EOS>
”He
<EOS>
spoke
very
guardedly
,
with
his
head
close
to
his
friend
's
though
both
narrowly
watched
the
warriors
,
while
giving
expression
to
their
own
fears
.
<EOS>
“Vie
<EOS>
did
n't
we
start
sooner
<EOS>
don
he
comes
?
”
<EOS>
whispered
Otto
,
his
jaw
trembling
with
fear
;
“
<EOS>
I
do
n't
see
vot
we
doted
does
.
<EOS>
”An
<EOS>
absurd
scheme
of
escape
suggested
itself
to
Jack
.
<EOS>
“I
wonder
whether
we
ca
n't
dash
through
the
side
of
the
lodge
and
get
away
.
<EOS>
”“Wait
<EOS>
till
I
sees
.
<EOS>
”Otto
<EOS>
carefully
leaned
back
with
a
view
of
learning
bow
much
resistance
the
deerskins
would
offer
.
<EOS>
While
they
were
quite
strong
,
they
were
not
taut
,
and
yielded
so
much
that
the
boy
tipped
over
backwards
,
with
his
feet
in
the
air
,
somewhat
after
the
style
of
the
baby
when
frolicking
on
the
blanket
.
<EOS>
The
two
warriors
,
including
the
squaw
,
looked
stolidly
at
him
,
and
there
was
not
the
trace
of
a
smile
on
any
countenance
.
<EOS>
Agitated
as
was
Jack
,
he
could
not
repress
a
slight
laugh
when
he
witnessed
the
discomfiture
of
his
companion
.
<EOS>
“Mine
gracious
!
”
<EOS>
muttered
Otto
,
clambering
to
the
sitting
position
again
<EOS>
;
“
I
dinks
dot
some
one
have
pulls
de
lodge
away
<EOS>
van
<EOS>
I
do
n't
leans
against
him
.
<EOS>
”Jack
shook
his
head
.
<EOS>
“There
's
no
use
of
trying
that
;
before
we
could
get
through
they
could
catch
us
both
.
<EOS>
If
they
attack
us
,
we
'll
have
to
make
the
beat
fight
we
can
.
<EOS>
”“And
dot
wo
n't
be
good
for
nodding
,
”
was
the
truthful
remark
of
Otto
,
who
looked
toward
the
two
warriors
again
.
<EOS>
The
Shawanoe
must
have
felt
he
was
entire
master
of
the
situation
.
<EOS>
As
if
to
remove
any
doubt
on
that
point
in
the
minds
of
the
youths
,
he
now
set
down
the
gun
he
had
picked
up
,
leaned
his
own
against
the
side
of
the
lodge
,
close
to
it
,
and
then
seated
himself
about
half
way
between
the
door
and
the
sleeping
baby
.
<EOS>
This
placed
him
opposite
Wish
-
o
-
wa
-
tum
and
closer
to
the
entrance
where
were
Otto
and
Jack
.
<EOS>
For
the
latter
to
pass
out
,
they
must
rush
by
both
warriors
,
a
feat
utterly
impossible
,
should
the
Indians
object
.
<EOS>
It
was
equally
beyond
their
power
to
secure
the
guns
,
which
would
have
proven
potent
factors
in
settling
the
question
.
<EOS>
“I
believe
he
has
left
the
rifles
there
on
purpose
to
tempt
us
to
make
a
dash
for
them
,
”
said
Jack
,
half
inclined
to
accept
the
challenge
,
hopeless
as
it
was
.
<EOS>
“Dot
<EOS>
ish
vot
<EOS>
they
does
him
for
,
”
assented
Otto
.
<EOS>
Jack
was
strongly
of
the
belief
that
other
Shawanoes
were
near
.
<EOS>
It
was
unreasonable
to
suppose
that
a
single
warrior
would
have
crossed
the
Mississippi
alone
,
when
a
dozen
of
them
had
proven
unable
to
bring
the
boys
to
terms
.
<EOS>
“They
have
found
we
are
in
here
,
”
was
the
thought
of
the
boy
,
“
and
becoming
tired
of
waiting
for
us
,
have
sent
this
one
to
talk
with
the
Osage
and
to
hurry
us
out
.
<EOS>
Ah
,
why
did
Deerfoot
leave
us
so
soon
?
<EOS>
If
we
ever
needed
him
,
now
is
the
time
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
name
of
the
wonderful
youth
gave
a
new
turn
to
the
thoughts
of
the
lad
.
<EOS>
He
asked
himself
whether
it
was
probable
that
the
Shawanoes
and
Miamis
had
sent
a
party
over
to
pursue
the
boys
alone
,
or
to
revenge
themselves
upon
Deerfoot
.
<EOS>
Their
enmity
against
the
latter
must
be
tenfold
greater
than
it
could
be
against
any
one
else
.
<EOS>
The
most
natural
decision
to
which
the
lad
could
come
was
that
the
hostiles
were
numerous
enough
to
divide
and
follow
both
trails
.
<EOS>
At
any
rate
it
was
improbable
,
as
has
already
been
said
,
that
the
task
of
running
the
youths
to
earth
was
entrusted
to
a
single
warrior
.
<EOS>
While
Wish
-
o
-
wa
-
tum
and
his
latest
visitor
were
talking
in
their
odd
,
granting
fashion
,
the
boys
carefully
studied
their
countenances
,
in
the
vain
effort
to
read
the
meaning
of
the
words
that
passed
their
lips
.
<EOS>
They
occasionally
glanced
at
the
squaw
,
who
manifested
more
interest
than
was
expected
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
she
held
the
pipe
for
a
minute
or
two
motionless
,
her
eyes
on
the
warriors
,
as
if
anxious
to
catch
every
word
.
<EOS>
Then
she
would
give
a
snuff
or
grunt
,
lean
forward
and
stir
the
fire
and
smoke
with
great
vigor
.
<EOS>
To
the
amazement
of
the
listening
boys
,
the
red
men
all
at
once
changed
their
language
to
the
English
—
or
rather
they
attempted
to
do
so
,
for
they
made
sorry
work
of
it
.
<EOS>
“Dog
<EOS>
Deerfoot
—
he
dog
,
”
was
the
somewhat
obscure
remark
of
the
latest
arrival
.
<EOS>
“Him
<EOS>
so
,
”
nodded
Man
-
not
-
Afraid
-
of
-
Thunder
,
who
probably
had
never
beard
of
the
individual
until
within
the
last
few
minutes
.
<EOS>
“Deerfoot
dog
—
coward
—
shoot
Injin
no
more
.
<EOS>
”Wish
<EOS>
-
o
-
wa
-
tum
started
a
reply
in
English
,
but
the
difficulty
was
such
that
he
slid
back
into
his
own
lingo
.
<EOS>
Consequently
,
the
purport
of
what
he
said
was
lost
upon
the
youths
.
<EOS>
Jack
Carleton
,
however
,
was
quick
enough
to
suspect
the
meaning
,
of
the
proceeding
which
troubled
him
so
much
at
first
.
<EOS>
The
words
in
broken
English
were
intended
for
the
friends
of
Deerfoot
.
<EOS>
It
was
characteristic
of
the
Shawanoe
visitor
that
he
should
attempt
to
play
upon
the
feelings
of
the
hapless
boys
.
<EOS>
“Deerfoot
<EOS>
dead
,
”
he
added
,
with
a
sidelong
glance
toward
the
latter
,
which
confirmed
the
suspicion
of
the
young
Kentuckian
.
<EOS>
Otto
started
on
hearing
the
words
,
but
whispered
,
as
he
hitched
closer
to
his
friend:“I
<EOS>
do
n't
dinks
so
.
<EOS>
”“Nor
do
I
—
hark!”“How
die
?
”
<EOS>
asked
Wish
-
o
-
wa
-
tum
again
struggling
with
the
tongue
to
which
he
was
a
subject
rather
than
<EOS>
of
which
he
was
master
.
<EOS>
“Arorara
threw
him
down
,
”
replied
the
visitor
,
striking
his
fist
against
his
breast
to
signify
the
name
<EOS>
was
his
own
;
“
jump
on
him
—
take
scalp
.
<EOS>
Deerfoot
dog!”“I
know
how
deceitful
the
Indians
are
,
”
said
Jack
in
the
same
low
tone
,
“
but
that
fellow
do
n't
know
bow
to
lie
in
English
.
<EOS>
I
should
like
to
see
the
warrior
that
can
throw
Deerfoot
down
and
take
his
scalp
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
Shawanoe
seemed
to
have
overheard
the
expression
,
or
at
least
suspected
its
meaning
,
guarded
though
the
words
were
in
their
utterance
,
for
he
leaped
to
his
feet
and
again
striking
his
fist
against
his
chest
,
exclaimed
in
hot
anger:“Deerfoot
dog
—
<EOS>
Deerfoot
dead
!
<EOS>
Arorara
take
scalp
.
”To
<EOS>
the
amazement
of
Jack
Carleton
,
Otto
also
sprang
to
his
feet
,
and
struck
his
chest
a
resounding
thump
.
<EOS>
“Arorara
ish
one
pig
liar
!
”
<EOS>
he
shouted
;
“
he
is
a
liar
as
never
vos
!
<EOS>
He
says
dot
Deerfoot
is
dead
,
and
dere
stands
Deerfoot
now!”And
as
the
German
lad
thundered
the
words
,
he
pointed
toward
the
deerskin
,
which
had
been
flung
back
once
more
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
XXXI
.
<EOS>
PURSUER
AND
PURSUEDWhen
Deerfoot
<EOS>
the
Shawanoe
encountered
his
enemy
in
the
path
and
turned
over
the
rifle
to
him
,
he
knew
that
his
leniency
toward
his
implacable
foe
had
not
softened
his
heart
in
the
least
.
<EOS>
He
only
awaited
the
opportunity
to
turn
like
a
rattlesnake
on
his
magnanimous
master
,
and
the
youth
therefore
took
particular
care
that
such
opportunity
should
not
be
given
him
.
<EOS>
Deerfoot
held
his
tomahawk
tightly
grasped
and
poised
,
determined
to
hurl
it
with
resistless
and
unerring
aim
on
the
very
first
move
of
the
warrior
against
him
.
<EOS>
He
remained
as
rigid
as
bronze
until
the
other
was
a
couple
of
rods
distant
.
<EOS>
Then
he
noiselessly
shoved
back
the
tomahawk
in
his
girdle
,
picked
up
his
bow
and
vanished
like
a
shadow
.
<EOS>
When
the
warrior
turned
,
as
the
reader
will
recall
,
he
saw
no
one
.
<EOS>
Deerfoot
was
confident
that
after
such
a
meeting
,
the
one
whom
he
had
spared
would
not
follow
him
.
<EOS>
He
would
be
glad
enough
to
escape
altogether
without
arousing
the
wrath
of
him
who
would
not
show
mercy
a
second
time
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
the
matchless
youth
sped
along
the
path
in
the
gathering
gloom
,
with
that
swiftness
which
earned
him
his
expressive
name
while
he
was
yet
a
mere
boy
.
<EOS>
No
man
,
American
or
Caucasian
,
could
hold
his
own
against
him
in
his
phenomenal
fleetness
.
<EOS>
He
swept
through
the
forest
,
never
pausing
,
but
darting
forward
like
a
bird
on
the
wing
,
that
eludes
by
the
marvelous
quickness
of
eye
the
labyrinth
of
limbs
and
obstructions
which
interpose
almost
every
second
across
his
line
of
flight
.
<EOS>
Not
until
he
had
sped
fully
a
half
mile
did
slacken
in
the
slightest
his
astonishing
pace
,
and
then
there
was
not
the
least
quickening
of
the
pulse
or
hastening
of
the
gentle
breath
.
<EOS>
Had
chose
,
he
could
have
maintained
the
same
for
hours
without
discomfort
or
fatigue
.
<EOS>
While
,
in
one
sense
,
Deerfoot
was
fleeing
a
Shawanoe
,
he
was
,
in
the
same
sense
,
pursue
another
,
in
whom
his
chief
interest
centered
.
<EOS>
The
night
deepened
,
and
the
moon
,
climbing
above
the
tree
tops
,
penetrated
the
gloomy
recesses
in
few
places
with
its
silvery
beams
.
<EOS>
When
a
mile
had
been
passed
,
the
young
warrior
paused
and
listened
.
<EOS>
“He
can
not
follow
me
when
his
eyes
see
no
trail
,
”
he
said
to
himself
,
alluding
to
the
Shawanoe
whom
he
had
spared
.
<EOS>
It
followed
as
a
corollary
that
the
same
difficulty
confronted
him
in
pursuing
his
friends
and
the
enemy
who
clung
so
close
to
their
footprints
.
<EOS>
He
stopped
and
softly
passed
his
hand
over
the
leafy
ground
.
<EOS>
Not
the
slightest
artificial
depression
was
there
;
he
had
lost
the
trail
of
the
party
.
<EOS>
As
it
was
utterly
out
of
the
question
to
learn
how
far
he
had
diverged
from
the
path
,
it
was
also
beyond
his
power
to
return
to
it
—
that
is
,
so
long
as
the
night
lasted
.
<EOS>
The
hoof
-
prints
of
the
horse
were
cut
so
deep
in
the
yielding
earth
that
,
with
considerable
trouble
,
he
could
have
traced
them
among
the
trees
;
but
even
then
he
would
lack
the
great
help
which
the
scout
is
generally
able
to
command
.
<EOS>
In
following
a
trail
at
night
,
he
needs
to
possess
a
thorough
knowledge
of
the
country
,
so
as
to
reason
out
the
probable
destination
of
his
enemies
,
and
consequently
the
general
route
they
will
take
.
<EOS>
More
than
likely
they
will
aim
for
some
crossing
or
camping
ground
,
many
miles
in
advance
.
<EOS>
The
knowledge
of
the
hunter
may
enable
him
to
take
a
shorter
course
and
,
by
putting
his
horse
to
his
best
,
reach
of
them
.
<EOS>
About
all
he
does
,
when
engaged
in
this
hot
chase
,
is
to
take
his
observations
at
widely
separated
points
,
with
a
view
of
learning
he
is
going
astray
.
<EOS>
It
was
precisely
in
this
manner
that
the
greatest
scout
of
modern
days
,
Kit
Carson
,
led
a
party
on
the
heels
of
a
party
of
Mexican
horse
-
thieves
,
with
his
steeds
on
a
fall
gallop
the
night
thoroughly
overtook
the
criminals
at
daylight
,
chastised
them
and
recaptured
the
stolen
property
.
<EOS>
Deerfoot
was
lacking
in
that
one
requisite
—
familiarity
with
the
country
.
<EOS>
He
had
journeyed
up
and
down
the
shores
of
the
Mississippi
,
had
visited
the
settlement
further
west
,
and
had
gain
much
knowledge
of
the
southwestern
portion
of
the
present
State
of
Missouri
;
but
this
member
of
our
Union
occupies
an
immense
area
,
and
years
would
be
needed
to
enable
him
to
act
as
guide
through
every
section
of
it
.
<EOS>
He
had
never
traveled
in
many
parts
,
and
it
will
be
perceived
,
therefore
,
that
it
was
out
of
his
power
to
theorize
in
the
wonderfully
brilliant
manner
which
often
made
his
successes
due
to
an
intuitive
inspiration
that
at
times
seemed
to
hover
on
the
verge
of
the
unknowable
sixth
sense
.
<EOS>
But
strange
must
be
the
occasion
in
which
Deerfoot
would
feel
compelled
to
fold
his
,
arms
and
say
,
“
I
can
do
no
more
.
”He
<EOS>
had
stood
less
than
three
minutes
in
the
attitude
of
deep
attention
,
when
he
emitted
a
peculiar
fluttering
whistle
,
such
as
a
timid
night
bird
sometimes
makes
from
its
perch
in
the
up
most
branches
,
while
calling
to
its
mate
.
<EOS>
It
was
still
trembling
on
the
air
,
when
a
response
came
from
a
point
not
far
away
and
to
the
right
.
<EOS>
Could
any
one
have
seen
the
face
of
the
youthful
Shawanoe
,
he
would
have
observed
a
faint
but
grim
smile
playing
around
his
mouth
.
<EOS>
He
had
uttered
the
signal
which
the
Shawanoes
rarely
used
.
<EOS>
When
members
of
their
scouts
became
temporarily
lost
from
each
other
,
while
in
the
immediate
neighborhood
of
an
enemy
,
and
it
was
necessary
they
should
locate
themselves
,
they
did
so
by
means
of
the
signal
described
.
<EOS>
They
refrained
from
appealing
to
it
except
in
cases
of
the
utmost
urgency
,
for
if
used
too
often
it
was
likely
to
become
known
to
their
enemies
and
its
usefulness
thus
destroyed
.
<EOS>
Deerfoot
had
secured
a
reply
from
the
Shawanoe
for
whom
he
was
hunting
,
and
thus
learned
his
precise
whereabouts
.
<EOS>
He
instantly
began
stealing
his
way
toward
him
.
<EOS>
The
usage
among
this
remarkable
tribe
of
Indians
required
him
to
repeat
the
peculiar
cry
after
hearing
it
,
and
the
party
of
the
second
should
respond
similarly
.
<EOS>
When
the
call
had
been
wafted
back
and
forth
in
this
fashion
,
Shawanoe
law
forbade
its
repetition
,
except
after
a
considerable
interval
,
and
then
only
under
the
most
urgent
necessity
.
<EOS>
Deerfoot
held
his
peace
,
though
he
knew
warrior
was
awaiting
his
answer
.
<EOS>
Failing
to
call
the
response
,
the
other
would
conclude
that
the
signal
was
in
truth
the
call
of
a
bird
;
but
to
guard
against
any
error
,
he
repeated
the
tremulous
whistle
,
when
the
stealthy
Deerfoot
was
within
a
few
rods
.
<EOS>
The
latter
could
have
taken
his
life
with
suddenness
almost
of
the
lightning
bolt
,
but
he
had
no
wish
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
If
Jack
Carleton
and
Otto
Relstaub
were
in
danger
it
would
be
from
this
warrior
alone
,
and
so
long
as
Deerfoot
could
keep
him
“
in
hand
”
no
such
danger
existed
.
<EOS>
In
the
open
forest
,
where
the
moonlight
penetrated
,
a
shadowy
figure
assumed
shape
,
and
the
pursuer
recognized
it
as
that
of
the
Indian
whom
he
was
so
anxious
to
find
.
<EOS>
He
had
concluded
to
wait
no
longer
,
and
was
advancing
in
a
blind
way
along
the
trail
of
the
lads
.
<EOS>
Deerfoot
stooped
and
passed
his
hand
over
the
ground
.
<EOS>
One
sweep
was
enough
to
,
identify
the
prints
of
the
horse
's
hoofs
,
and
the
more
delicate
impressions
made
by
shoes
and
moccasins
.
<EOS>
The
young
Shawanoe
,
by
a
careful
examination
of
the
trail
,
did
that
which
will
scarcely
be
believed
:
he
ascertained
that
one
pair
of
moccasins
went
forward
and
the
other
took
the
opposite
course
.
<EOS>
Consequently
,
the
Shawanoes
had
parted
company
at
a
point
slightly
in
advance
(
it
could
not
be
far
)
,
and
the
warrior
whom
he
saw
must
have
waited
where
he
was
while
the
night
was
closing
in
.
<EOS>
A
few
rods
further
and
a
second
examination
revealed
the
trail
of
a
single
pair
of
moccasins
,
the
line
of
demarcation
had
been
passed
.
<EOS>
All
this
time
the
elder
was
pushing
among
trees
,
Deerfoot
catching
a
glimpse
of
him
now
and
then
,
so
as
to
be
able
to
regulate
his
own
pace
that
of
his
enemy
.
<EOS>
It
was
needful
also
that
much
circumspection
should
be
used
,
for
when
one
person
can
trace
the
movements
of
another
,
it
follows
that
the
possibilities
are
reciprocal
and
the
law
vice
versa
obtains
.
<EOS>
The
youth
therefore
held
resolutely
back
,
and
so
guarded
his
movements
that
he
was
assured
against
detection
by
any
glance
the
warrior
might
cast
behind
him
.
<EOS>
The
trees
in
front
diminished
in
number
and
soon
ceased
altogether
.
<EOS>
The
Shawanoe
had
reached
the
edge
of
a
natural
opening
or
clearing
.
<EOS>
Pausing
a
moment
,
he
stepped
out
where
the
moon
shone
full
upon
him
,
and
then
halted
again
.
<EOS>
Having
the
advantage
of
cover
,
Deerfoot
slipped
carefully
forward
,
until
he
stood
within
a
few
yards
of
the
red
man
,
who
little
dreamed
of
the
dreaded
one
that
was
within
the
throw
of
a
tomahawk
.
<EOS>
The
elder
Indian
seemed
to
be
speculating
the
probable
course
of
the
unconscious
fugitives
.
<EOS>
It
could
not
be
supposed
that
he
was
familiar
with
the
country
(
since
his
home
was
on
the
other
side
of
the
Mississippi
)
,
but
like
the
majority
of
mankind
when
in
difficulty
,
he
was
able
to
form
a
theory
,
but
unlike
that
majority
,
he
proved
his
faith
in
it
by
his
works
.
<EOS>
Instead
of
following
the
footprints
,
he
diverged
to
the
right
and
coursed
along
the
edge
of
the
clearing
,
where
he
was
almost
entirely
concealed
by
the
shadow
of
the
trees
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
gone
far
,
when
Deerfoot
silently
emerged
from
the
wood
.
<EOS>
His
keen
eye
revealed
what
must
have
been
noticed
by
the
other
:
on
that
spot
the
boys
had
stopped
with
the
intention
of
encamping
for
the
night
.
<EOS>
Had
they
remained
,
beyond
all
doubt
one
or
both
would
have
been
slain
,
but
from
some
cause
(
long
since
explained
to
the
reader
)
<EOS>
they
passed
on
.
<EOS>
Deerfoot
hurried
on
with
a
speed
that
was
almost
reckless
,
for
that
marvelous
intuition
seemed
to
whisper
that
the
crisis
was
near
.
<EOS>
His
friends
could
not
be
far
off
,
and
the
question
of
safety
or
danger
must
be
speedily
settled
.
<EOS>
Just
beyond
the
clearing
,
while
hastening
forward
,
he
caught
,
the
glow
of
the
fire
shining
through
the
rents
and
crevices
of
the
shabby
skin
of
the
Osage
wigwam
.
<EOS>
He
heard
the
of
voices
within
,
and
a
few
seconds
later
he
was
peeping
through
the
same
orifice
that
had
a
similar
purpose
for
jack
Carleton
when
played
the
part
of
eavesdropper
.

CHAPTER
XXXII
.
<EOS>
TURNING
THE
TABLESAlthough
Jack
Carleton
and
Otto
Relstaub
understood
nothing
of
the
conversation
(
excepting
the
few
words
of
mangled
English
)
between
Wish
-
o
-
wa
-
tum
,
the
Osage
chieftain
,
and
the
Shawanoe
who
entered
his
lodge
,
little
was
lost
upon
Deerfoot
.
<EOS>
Without
quoting
the
language
,
it
may
be
said
that
Arorara
declared
the
two
boys
to
be
thieves
and
wretches
of
the
worst
imaginable
degree
.
<EOS>
They
had
stolen
the
horses
of
the
Shawanoes
and
Miamis
,
and
had
treacherously
shot
,
not
only
the
warriors
,
but
the
squaws
and
papooses
,
when
they
lay
asleep
by
their
camp
-
fires
.
<EOS>
Arorara
said
he
had
been
sent
by
his
people
to
follow
across
the
river
,
and
punish
them
for
their
many
crimes
.
<EOS>
His
purpose
in
placing
the
guns
as
he
had
done
,
near
the
entrance
of
the
lodge
,
was
to
tempt
the
boys
to
make
a
rush
to
escape
.
<EOS>
When
they
did
so
,
Arorara
proposed
that
he
and
Wish
-
o
-
wa
-
tum
should
leap
upon
them
with
knives
.
<EOS>
When
this
plan
was
fully
explained
to
the
chief
,
he
nodded
his
head
and
signified
that
he
would
willingly
lend
his
hand
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
matter
of
indifference
to
him
,
and
,
but
for
the
coming
of
the
Shawanoe
,
he
probably
would
have
allow
the
boys
to
depart
without
harm
.
<EOS>
With
Wish
-
o
-
wa
-
tum
the
whole
question
resolved
itself
into
one
of
policy
.
<EOS>
He
lived
alone
and
had
never
been
disturbed
by
the
white
settlers
,
who
were
locating
in
different
parts
of
the
territory
.
<EOS>
If
he
should
help
in
the
taking
off
of
youngsters
,
their
friends
would
not
be
likely
to
suspect
him
,
and
there
was
little
probability
of
the
truth
ever
reaching
their
ears
.
<EOS>
But
,
if
he
refused
the
request
of
the
guest
,
the
fierce
tribe
to
which
he
belonged
would
be
sure
to
go
out
of
their
way
to
punish
him
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
gave
his
assent
,
and
added
that
he
was
ready
do
his
part
whenever
Arorara
wished
.
<EOS>
It
was
at
that
juncture
that
the
two
red
men
essayed
expression
in
English
,
and
Deerfoot
saw
that
he
must
interfere
at
once
.
<EOS>
While
moving
to
the
front
of
the
lodge
,
he
scanned
his
immediate
surroundings
,
so
far
as
he
could
,
but
neither
saw
nor
heard
anything
of
the
other
Shawanoe
.
<EOS>
In
short
,
from
what
has
already
been
told
,
it
will
be
seen
that
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
be
in
that
vicinity
.
<EOS>
Throwing
back
the
deerskin
,
the
youthful
warrior
stepped
quickly
within
the
wigwam
.
<EOS>
His
bow
was
flung
over
his
back
,
and
,
being
perfectly
familiar
with
the
interior
,
he
extended
his
hand
and
caught
up
the
weapon
nearest
him
,
standing
erect
and
facing
all
the
occupants
as
did
Arorara
a
short
time
before
.
<EOS>
This
movement
and
the
entrance
itself
were
made
with
such
deftness
that
no
one
observed
his
presence
,
with
the
exception
of
Otto
Relstaub
,
who
by
accident
happened
to
look
toward
him
just
as
he
entered
.
<EOS>
But
the
startling
words
of
the
German
lad
,
accompanied
by
the
extension
of
his
arm
and
finger
toward
the
door
,
turned
every
eye
like
a
flash
in
that
direction
.
<EOS>
They
were
just
in
time
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
arms
of
Deerfoot
,
as
they
were
raised
like
the
flitting
of
the
wings
of
a
bird
,
and
almost
in
the
same
breath
the
youth
was
seen
to
be
looking
along
the
gleaming
barrel
pointed
the
breast
of
the
astounded
warrior
.
<EOS>
“Dog
of
a
Shawanoe
!
”
<EOS>
exclaimed
Deerfoot
,
his
voice
as
firm
and
unwavering
as
his
nerves
;
“
coward
!
<EOS>
Serpent
that
creeps
in
the
grass
and
strikes
the
heel
of
the
hunter
<EOS>
;
Arorara
speaks
with
a
double
tongue
;
he
says
he
took
the
scalp
of
Deerfoot
,
but
the
scalp
of
Deerfoot
is
here
,
and
he
dares
Arorara
and
Waughtauk
and
Tecumseh
and
all
the
chiefs
and
sachems
and
warriors
of
the
Shawanoes
,
to
take
it!”The
rifle
,
with
the
hammer
drawn
back
,
<EOS>
was
flung
to
the
ground
,
and
whipping
out
his
hunting
knife
,
the
youth
grasped
the
handle
with
fingers
of
steel
and
assumed
a
defiant
attitude
.
<EOS>
His
face
was
aflame
with
passion
,
and
his
breast
became
a
raging
volcano
of
wrath
.
<EOS>
In
truth
,
Deerfoot
had
lost
control
of
himself
for
the
moment
.
<EOS>
An
overwhelming
sense
of
his
persecution
caused
his
nature
to
revolt
,
and
he
longed
for
the
excuse
to
leap
upon
the
Shawanoe
who
had
followed
him
across
the
Mississippi
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
single
moment
when
he
gathered
his
muscles
for
a
tiger
-
like
bound
at
his
enemy
,
he
was
restrained
only
by
the
pitiful
expression
on
the
terrified
countenance
.
<EOS>
The
youth
addressed
his
words
to
Arorara
and
his
blazing
eyes
were
fixed
on
him
.
<EOS>
He
had
no
quarrel
with
Wish
-
o
-
wa
-
tum
and
understood
his
position
,
but
he
would
not
have
shrunk
from
an
attack
by
both
.
<EOS>
Deerfoot
knew
that
either
was
more
powerful
than
he
,
but
in
cat
-
like
agility
there
could
be
no
comparison
between
them
.
<EOS>
Man
-
not
-
Afraid
-
of
-
Thunder
,
however
,
showed
very
plainly
that
he
held
the
invader
of
his
lodge
in
great
fear
.
<EOS>
He
displayed
visible
emotion
,
when
listening
to
the
ringing
words
of
defiance
;
but
he
possessed
sense
enough
to
perceive
they
were
not
addressed
to
him
,
and
he
continued
to
smoke
his
pipe
in
silence
.
<EOS>
The
squaw
at
the
further
end
of
the
wigwam
started
,
and
with
the
pipe
in
her
grasp
,
stared
with
a
dazed
expression
at
the
daring
intruder
;
then
,
like
the
true
mother
the
world
over
,
she
leaned
forward
,
caught
up
her
sleeping
infant
and
held
him
to
her
breast
,
ready
to
defend
him
with
her
life
.
<EOS>
Arorara
looked
in
turn
straight
into
the
burning
countenance
of
Deerfoot
.
<EOS>
The
elder
warrior
had
unconsciously
assumed
an
admirable
pose
,
his
left
foot
forward
,
his
hand
resting
on
the
handle
of
his
tomahawk
,
his
whole
position
that
of
a
gathering
his
strength
for
a
tremendous
leap
.
<EOS>
But
though
his
fingers
toyed
with
the
weapon
at
his
waist
,
they
did
not
draw
it
forth
;
it
was
for
that
precise
signal
the
youth
was
waiting
.
<EOS>
While
in
this
attitude
,
which
might
have
been
accepted
as
indicating
the
most
heroic
courage
,
Deerfoot
saw
the
lump
or
Adam
's
apple
rise
sink
in
his
throat
,
precisely
as
if
he
were
to
swallow
something
.
<EOS>
It
was
done
twice
,
and
was
a
sign
of
weakness
on
the
part
of
Arorara
.
<EOS>
The
consuming
anger
of
Deerfoot
burned
out
like
a
flash
of
powder
.
<EOS>
Hatred
became
contempt
;
enmity
turned
to
scorn
,
and
the
mortal
peril
of
the
warrior
vanished
.
<EOS>
“Who
<EOS>
now
is
the
dog
?
”
<EOS>
asked
Deerfoot
in
English
,
with
a
curl
of
his
lip
.
<EOS>
“
Arorara
is
brave
when
he
stands
before
the
youths
who
have
no
weapons
;
he
then
speaks
with
the
double
tongue
;
he
can
not
utter
the
truth
.
<EOS>
Arorara
has
his
tomahawk
and
knife
,
Deerfoot
has
his
;
let
them
fight
and
see
whose
scalp
shall
remain
.
<EOS>
”“Don't
<EOS>
you
do
dot
,
old
Roarer
,
”
exclaimed
Otto
Relstaub
,
stepping
forward
in
much
excitement
;
“
if
you
does
,
den
you
wo
n't
be
old
Roarer
not
any
more
,
as
nefer
vose
-
yaw
!
<EOS>
Dunderation!”“Let
them
alone
,
”
commanded
Jack
Carleton
,
catching
his
arm
and
drawing
him
back
;
“
do
n't
interfere
.
<EOS>
”“Don't
<EOS>
you
sees
?
”
<EOS>
asked
Otto
,
turning
his
head
and
speaking
in
a
whisper
;
“
I
want
to
scare
old
Roarer
.
”“There
<EOS>
's
no
call
for
doing
that
,
for
he
's
so
seared
<EOS>
now
he
ca
n't
speak
;
he
wo
n't
fight
Deerfoot
.
<EOS>
”Arorara
possessed
less
courage
than
Tecumseh
,
who
,
when
challenged
by
Deerfoot
in
almost
the
same
manner
,
would
have
fought
him
to
the
death
had
not
others
interposed
.
<EOS>
The
Shawanoe
was
now
in
mortal
terror
of
such
an
encounter
.
<EOS>
“Deerfoot
and
Arorara
are
brothers
,
”
said
he
,
swallowing
again
the
lump
that
rose
in
his
throat
;
“
they
belong
to
the
same
totem
;
they
are
Shawanoes
;
the
Great
Spirit
would
frown
to
see
them
harm
each
other
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
words
were
spoken
in
Shawanoe
,
but
Jack
and
Otto
saw
,
from
the
looks
and
manner
of
the
elder
warrior
,
that
he
was
subdued
and
could
not
be
forced
into
a
struggle
with
the
lithe
and
willowy
youth
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
flattering
to
the
pride
of
the
young
Kentuckian
and
his
companion
that
while
Arorara
felt
no
fear
of
them
jointly
,
he
was
terrified
by
the
bearing
of
Deerfoot
,
who
voluntarily
relinquished
the
advantage
he
possessed
in
the
hope
that
it
would
induce
the
other
to
fight
.
<EOS>
The
abject
words
of
Arorara
caused
a
reaction
in
the
feelings
of
Deerfoot
.
<EOS>
His
conscience
condemned
him
for
his
outburst
of
passion
,
and
had
the
situation
permitted
,
he
would
have
prostrated
himself
in
prayer
and
begged
the
forgiveness
of
the
Great
Spirit
whom
he
had
offended
.
<EOS>
But
nothing
in
his
face
or
voice
or
manner
betrayed
the
change
.
<EOS>
He
remained
standing
in
front
of
the
deerskin
,
which
was
thrown
back
,
so
that
the
light
from
the
camp
-
fire
shone
against
the
gloom
beyond
;
his
left
hand
held
the
knife
with
the
same
rigid
grasp
,
and
the
limbs
,
which
in
the
American
Indian
rarely
show
much
muscular
development
,
were
as
drawn
as
steel
.
<EOS>
The
squaw
clasped
the
sleeping
infant
to
her
husky
bosom
and
glared
at
Deerfoot
,
like
a
lioness
at
bay
.
<EOS>
Had
he
advanced
to
do
harm
to
her
offspring
<EOS>
,
she
would
have
sprang
upon
him
with
the
fierceness
of
that
beast
and
defended
the
little
one
to
the
death
.
<EOS>
Had
the
youth
assailed
Man
-
not
-
Afraid
-
of
-
Thunder
,
probably
she
would
have
sat
an
interested
spectator
of
the
scene
until
it
became
clear
which
way
it
was
going
,
when
she
might
have
wrapped
her
baby
in
bison
-
skin
,
placed
him
carefully
away
,
and
taken
a
part
in
the
struggle
.
<EOS>
The
Osage
resumed
the
deliberate
puffing
of
his
pipe
,
but
glanced
from
one
face
to
the
other
of
the
two
Shawanoes
.
<EOS>
Stolid
and
lazy
as
he
was
,
by
nature
and
training
,
he
could
not
help
feeling
stirred
by
the
curious
scene
.
<EOS>
Jack
Carleton
and
Otto
were
on
their
feet
,
studying
the
two
countenances
with
equal
intentness
.
<EOS>
Both
were
cheered
by
the
consciousness
that
danger
no
longer
threatened
them
,
and
that
whatever
followed
must
accord
with
the
fact
that
Deerfoot
the
Shawanoe
was
master
of
the
situation
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
XXXIII
.
<EOS>
CONCLUSION“My
brother
speaks
with
a
single
tongue
,
”
said
Deerfoot
,
replying
to
the
cringing
words
of
Arorara
:
“
the
Great
Spirit
will
frown
when
be
sees
two
brothers
fighting
each
other
.
<EOS>
Deerfoot
has
slain
more
than
one
Shawanoe
and
has
spared
others
;
he
will
spare
Arorara
;
he
may
sit
down
beside
the
Osage
warrior
and
smoke
pipe
with
him
.
<EOS>
”Immediately
the
youth
shoved
his
knife
in
place
,
and
for
the
first
time
seemed
to
become
aware
that
he
stood
in
the
presence
of
others
.
<EOS>
He
bestowed
no
attention
on
Wish
-
o
-
wa
-
tum
or
his
squaw
,
but
addressed
his
young
friends
.
<EOS>
“Let
<EOS>
my
brothers
go
from
this
lodge
and
make
their
way
homeward
;
Arorara
will
not
pursue
them
.
<EOS>
”“Arorara
<EOS>
will
do
them
no
harm
,
”
said
the
individual
in
as
cringing
manner
as
before
.
<EOS>
“
No
,
he
will
not
,
for
Deerfoot
will
watch
and
slay
Arorara
if
he
seeks
to
do
so
,
”
quietly
remarked
the
youth
,
who
,
in
every
sense
of
the
word
,
continued
master
of
the
situation
.
<EOS>
“Let
<EOS>
us
do
vot
<EOS>
he
tells
us
,
”
suggested
Otto
,
moving
awkwardly
toward
the
door
.
<EOS>
Deerfoot
stepped
slightly
aside
,
to
make
room
for
them
,
and
Jack
accepted
the
movement
as
an
invitation
for
them
to
pass
out
.
<EOS>
Otto
held
back
so
as
to
permit
the
other
to
go
first
,
and
he
followed
close
behind
him
.
<EOS>
Otto
did
not
glance
at
or
speak
to
either
.
<EOS>
He
had
his
misgivings
concerning
not
only
Arorara
,
but
the
Osage
,
who
might
resent
this
invasion
of
his
castle
.
<EOS>
Like
the
finely
trained
Indian
,
he
“
took
no
chances
.
<EOS>
”Jack
<EOS>
and
Otto
were
intensely
interested
in
the
situation
,
but
they
did
not
forget
themselves
.
<EOS>
The
former
,
as
be
passed
out
,
picked
up
his
own
rifle
,
while
Otto
took
the
one
belonging
to
the
Indian
,
who
was
left
at
liberty
to
hunt
the
gun
left
on
the
clearing
by
the
German
lad
when
he
prepared
to
start
his
camp
-
fire
for
the
evening
.
<EOS>
Thus
each
boy
was
furnished
with
the
weapon
which
is
indispensable
to
the
ranger
of
the
woods
.
<EOS>
Every
one
can
understand
the
reluctance
of
the
two
to
walk
from
the
lodge
with
their
turned
upon
their
foe
.
<EOS>
With
all
their
confidence
in
the
prowess
of
Deerfoot
,
they
felt
a
misgiving
which
was
sure
to
distress
them
,
so
long
as
the
enemies
were
in
sight
.
<EOS>
On
reaching
the
outside
,
therefore
,
they
turned
about
,
walked
slowly
backwards
,
and
watched
the
wigwam
.
<EOS>
The
deerskin
being
drawn
aside
,
they
could
the
figure
of
the
young
Shawanoe
,
who
had
stepped
back
in
front
of
it
.
<EOS>
Just
beyond
was
partly
visible
<EOS>
the
subdued
Shawanoe
,
he
and
his
conqueror
obscuring
the
squaw
,
still
further
away
,
while
Man
-
not
-
Afraid
-
of
-
Thunder
<EOS>
was
out
of
range
.
<EOS>
“I
think
that
little
place
saw
more
surprises
,
this
evening
than
it
will
ever
see
again
,
”
said
Jack
Carleton
,
bending
his
head
with
the
purpose
of
gaining
a
better
view
;
“
in
fact
it
has
been
a
series
of
surprise
parties
from
the
beginning
.
<EOS>
”“Yaw
,
dot
ish
vot
<EOS>
I
dinks
all
a'while
,
but
mine
gracious!”Hitherto
<EOS>
it
had
been
the
running
vines
,
growing
close
to
the
ground
,
which
caused
overturnings
of
Otto
,
but
now
it
was
another
obstruction
in
the
shape
of
a
tree
trunk
,
over
which
Jack
stepped
,
taking
care
however
,
to
say
nothing
to
his
companion
concerning
it
.
<EOS>
The
smaller
sticks
lying
near
made
it
look
as
if
the
trunk
served
to
help
the
squaw
of
Man
-
not
-
Afraid
-
of
-
Thunder
,
when
she
was
breaking
or
cutting
wood
for
the
wigwam
.
<EOS>
Be
that
as
it
may
,
the
heels
of
Otto
struck
it
<EOS>
and
he
went
over
on
his
back
,
with
hat
and
gun
flying
and
shoes
pointed
upward
.
<EOS>
“I
dinks
<EOS>
dot
vos
a
pig
vine
,
”
he
said
,
clambering
to
his
feet
and
shaking
himself
together
again
.
<EOS>
“You're
getting
to
be
the
best
fellow
at
tumbling
<EOS>
I
ever
saw
,
”
said
Jack
,
suppressing
,
as
well
as
he
could
,
his
laughter
.
<EOS>
“Dot
<EOS>
ish
<EOS>
so
,
”
assented
the
victim
,
too
good
-
natured
to
find
fault
after
his
fortunate
escape
.
<EOS>
By
this
time
,
they
were
so
far
from
the
Osage
lodge
that
very
little
could
be
seen
of
the
interior
,
and
they
turned
round
and
walked
side
by
side
.
<EOS>
“It
seems
like
a
dream
,
”
remarked
the
young
Kentuckian
;
“
a
few
minutes
ago
,
there
was
no
escape
for
us
,
and
now
I
can
not
think
we
are
in
the
least
danger
.
<EOS>
”“Who
dinks
dot
de
Shawanoes
comes
over
der
river
after
us
?
”
<EOS>
asked
Otto
.
<EOS>
“Nobody
<EOS>
besides
Deerfoot
:
there
is
n't
anything
that
he
does
n't
think
of
that
is
worth
thinking
about
.
<EOS>
”“Den
<EOS>
vy
he
leaves
us
,
<EOS>
when
we
leaves
him?”“I've
asked
myself
that
question
,
Otto
;
it
must
be
that
,
after
we
parted
,
he
learned
something
which
told
him
the
Shawanoes
had
crossed
the
Mississippi
after
us
.
<EOS>
He
changed
his
course
and
came
to
our
help
,
and
it
's
mighty
fortunate
<EOS>
he
did
so
.
<EOS>
”“I
<EOS>
guess
<EOS>
dot
ish
<EOS>
so
;
we
will
asks
him
when
we
do
n't
see
him
.
<EOS>
”“I
<EOS>
have
my
doubt
about
seeing
him
again
.
<EOS>
”“How
ish
<EOS>
dot?”“You
remember
he
said
more
than
once
he
had
reason
to
take
another
course
,
and
he
did
do
so
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
have
been
blamed
for
believing
we
were
able
to
get
along
without
him
,
after
entering
Louisiana
.
<EOS>
At
any
rate
,
he
will
think
so
now
.
<EOS>
”This
was
a
reasonable
conclusion
,
and
Otto
agreed
with
his
friend
that
they
were
not
likely
to
meet
the
extraordinary
youth
for
some
time
to
come
.
<EOS>
He
would
probably
take
another
direction
,
for
,
after
the
threat
he
uttered
to
Arorara
,
and
the
panic
into
which
he
had
thrown
him
,
that
warrior
would
be
glad
to
hasten
back
to
his
friends
,
who
were
equally
eager
to
reach
Kentucky
without
loss
of
time
.
<EOS>
The
moon
was
high
in
the
heavens
and
the
woods
open
.
<EOS>
Much
to
the
relief
of
Otto
,
the
vines
gave
him
no
further
trouble
,
and
they
progressed
without
difficulty
.
<EOS>
The
neighborhood
was
strange
to
them
,
but
they
had
tramped
the
wilderness
too
often
to
care
.
<EOS>
They
were
sure
of
the
general
direction
they
were
following
,
and
were
confident
now
of
reaching
home
,
which
could
be
no
great
distance
away
.
<EOS>
Such
a
buoyancy
of
spirits
came
over
the
boys
that
it
was
hard
to
restrain
themselves
from
shouting
and
leaping
with
joy
.
<EOS>
But
for
the
mishaps
attending
such
sport
they
would
have
run
at
full
speed
and
flung
their
hats
in
air
.
<EOS>
Several
miles
were
passed
before
they
became
thoughtful
and
quiet
.
<EOS>
“Mine
gracious
!
”
<EOS>
abruptly
exclaimed
Otto
,
stopping
short
and
striking
his
knee
a
resounding
whack
;
“
vere
ai
n't
dot
hoss?”“Had
<EOS>
you
forgotten
about
him
?
”
<EOS>
asked
companion
with
a
smile
.
<EOS>
“I
<EOS>
nefer
dinks
apout
him
since
we
comes
the
lodge
.
<EOS>
”“I
<EOS>
have
,
more
than
once
;
I
made
up
my
mind
,
when
I
found
you
in
the
wigwam
,
that
if
you
got
out
alive
,
I
would
insist
that
we
go
straight
home
and
think
no
more
about
the
animal
;
but
matters
are
in
a
better
shape
,
and
we
'll
wait
till
to
-
morrow
before
we
decide
.
<EOS>
”“Dot
suits
me
,
”
assented
Otto
,
nodding
his
head
several
times
.
<EOS>
As
nearly
as
they
could
conjecture
,
they
were
some
six
miles
from
the
residence
of
Wish
-
o
-
wa
-
tum
or
Man
-
not
-
Afraid
-
of
-
Thunder
,
when
they
decided
to
stop
for
the
night
.
<EOS>
They
were
fully
warranted
in
believing
that
all
danger
from
red
men
was
ended
;
and
,
as
they
had
no
means
of
finding
a
good
camping
site
,
they
stopped
at
once
and
began
gathering
fuel
.
<EOS>
The
task
was
soon
over
,
and
the
flint
and
steel
gave
the
speedily
grew
into
a
roaring
blaze
,
the
boys
sat
and
looked
in
each
other
's
face
.
<EOS>
The
night
was
cool
,
but
pleasant
.
<EOS>
Clouds
,
however
,
were
continually
drifting
across
the
face
of
the
moon
,
and
a
certain
restlessness
of
feeling
,
of
which
even
the
rugged
youngsters
were
sensible
,
told
that
a
change
was
coming
.
<EOS>
The
hour
spent
in
the
Osage
wigwam
was
redolent
of
smoking
venison
,
and
the
boys
smacked
their
lips
and
shook
their
heads
,
after
the
manner
of
youngsters
,
with
healthful
appetites
<EOS>
but
there
was
no
way
of
procuring
food
,
and
they
philosophically
accepted
the
situation
,
refraining
from
reference
to
eatables
until
there
was
a
prospect
of
obtaining
them
.
<EOS>
Through
all
the
eventful
experience
of
the
evening
,
Jack
and
Otto
had
retained
their
blankets
.
<EOS>
The
circumstances
were
such
that
neither
of
the
Indians
with
whom
they
were
brought
in
contact
cared
to
secure
them
,
though
it
may
be
suspected
that
,
Wish
-
o
-
wa
-
tum
would
have
laid
claim
to
that
of
the
German
,
except
for
the
visit
of
Arorara
and
Deerfoot
.
<EOS>
Seated
by
the
cheerful
fire
,
the
friends
talked
in
rambling
fashion
until
drowsy
,
when
they
wrapped
their
blankets
around
them
and
lay
down
to
sleep
.
<EOS>
Some
risk
was
involved
in
the
proceeding
,
inasmuch
as
the
fire
was
likely
to
attract
wild
animals
to
the
spot
,
but
providentially
none
disturbed
the
young
pioneers
,
who
slept
quiet
and
security
until
the
sun
was
in
the
sky
.
<EOS>
The
first
step
was
a
hunt
for
breakfast
,
for
Jack
and
Otto
were
in
a
state
of
ravenous
hunger
.
<EOS>
They
separated
and
were
gone
a
half
hour
,
when
the
rifle
of
the
young
Kentuckian
rang
out
and
he
soon
reappeared
by
the
renewed
camp
-
fire
with
a
fine
wild
turkey
,
which
,
it
need
not
be
said
,
afforded
a
nourishing
and
delightful
meal
for
them
both
.
<EOS>
“Otto
,
”
said
Jack
,
springing
to
his
feet
like
a
refreshed
giant
<EOS>
,
“
we
must
hunt
again
for
the
horse
.
<EOS>
”“Dot
<EOS>
ishn't
<EOS>
vot
<EOS>
I
do
n't
dinks
too
—
<EOS>
dot
ish
<EOS>
I
does
dinks
so
.
<EOS>
”“And
you
must
now
try
to
straighten
out
your
English
,
so
that
Deerfoot
and
I
may
not
be
ashamed
of
you
.
<EOS>
”Otto
nodded
his
head
by
way
of
assent
,
while
he
thought
hard
about
the
proper
manner
of
expressing
himself
.
<EOS>
But
an
almost
insurmountable
difficulty
confronted
the
boys
from
the
first
.
<EOS>
It
was
impossible
to
make
search
for
the
missing
animal
until
his
footprints
should
be
found
,
and
the
only
way
in
which
that
could
be
done
was
by
retracing
,
to
a
considerable
extent
,
their
own
footsteps
.
<EOS>
Though
somewhat
disappointed
,
Jack
Carleton
was
not
surprised
,
when
taking
his
bearings
by
the
sun
<EOS>
,
he
learned
they
had
wandered
from
the
proper
path
.
<EOS>
They
had
turned
to
the
left
,
until
the
course
was
south
of
southwest
.
<EOS>
They
had
gone
far
astray
indeed
.
<EOS>
The
weather
became
more
threatening
.
<EOS>
The
sun
had
been
above
the
horizon
less
than
an
hour
when
its
light
was
obscured
by
clouds
,
and
the
windows
of
heaven
were
certain
to
be
opened
long
before
the
orb
should
sink
in
the
west
.
<EOS>
Two
miles
were
traveled
,
when
the
boys
found
themselves
so
close
to
a
large
clearing
,
that
they
wondered
how
it
escaped
their
notice
the
preceding
night
.
<EOS>
It
covered
more
than
an
acre
,
and
at
one
time
was
the
site
of
an
Indian
village
.
<EOS>
As
a
matter
of
course
a
small
stream
ran
near
,
and
the
red
men
who
at
no
remote
day
made
their
dwelling
places
there
must
have
numbered
fully
a
hundred
.
<EOS>
While
wandering
over
the
tract
and
looking
about
them
,
their
eyes
rested
on
an
elevation
no
more
than
a
third
of
a
mile
distant
.
<EOS>
It
was
thickly
wooded
,
but
a
prodigious
rock
near
the
crest
resembled
a
spot
that
had
been
burned
clear
.
<EOS>
“Helloa
!
<EOS>
”
suddenly
called
out
Jack
Carleton
,
while
gazing
in
the
direction
,
“
there
's
someone
on
that
rock
.
<EOS>
”“I
guess
it
ish
a
crow
or
bear
—
<EOS>
no
,
it
ishn't
.
<EOS>
”“My
<EOS>
gracious
!
<EOS>
it
's
Deerfoot
.
<EOS>
”A
<EOS>
moment
's
scrutiny
proved
that
the
individual
,
beyond
all
question
was
an
Indian
.
<EOS>
Furthermore
,
he
was
making
signals
,
probably
having
descried
them
before
they
saw
him
.
<EOS>
“I
<EOS>
guess
he
only
means
to
salute
us
,
”
said
Jack
.
<EOS>
Such
seemed
to
be
the
case
.
<EOS>
The
red
man
who
was
Deerfoot
,
waved
his
hand
in
friendly
salutation
several
minutes
,
then
leaped
from
the
rock
and
vanished
.
<EOS>
It
looked
as
if
he
had
taken
several
hours
to
assure
himself
the
boys
were
in
no
danger
from
the
Shawanoes
;
and
,
having
done
so
,
he
now
bade
them
good
-
bye
in
his
characteristic
fashion
,
giving
his
whole
thought
and
energy
to
the
business
which
carried
him
far
into
the
southwestern
portion
of
the
present
State
of
Missouri
.
<EOS>
Jack
and
Otto
gazed
in
the
direction
of
the
rock
a
considerable
while
,
hoping
their
friend
would
reappear
,
or
that
he
had
started
to
join
them
;
but
they
were
compelled
to
believe
he
had
left
,
and
for
a
time
at
least
,
would
be
seen
no
more
.
<EOS>
The
boys
followed
the
back
trail
some
distance
further
,
when
to
their
delight
they
came
upon
the
footprints
of
the
missing
horse
,
marked
so
distinctly
in
the
yielding
earth
that
there
could
be
no
mistake
as
to
their
identity
.
<EOS>
“Now
,
that
's
what
I
call
good
luck
,
”
exclaimed
Jack
,
slapping
his
friend
on
the
back
.
<EOS>
“Dot
<EOS>
ish
vot
<EOS>
I
dinks
—
how
ish
dot
?
”
<EOS>
asked
Otto
with
a
beaming
face
,
alluding
to
his
own
diction
.
<EOS>
“Capital!—think
twice
before
you
speak
once
,
and
before
long
you
wo
n't
be
the
worst
bungler
with
your
tongue
that
lives
west
of
the
Alleghenies
.
<EOS>
”'The
German
gazed
at
his
companion
as
if
on
the
point
of
reproving
him
,
but
concluded
to
take
time
to
put
his
words
in
proper
shape
.
<EOS>
An
interesting
fact
was
noticed
by
both
:
the
trail
verged
toward
the
elevation
where
they
last
saw
Deerfoot
.
<EOS>
Jack
Carleton
was
set
to
thinking
and
speculating
over
the
situation
.
<EOS>
He
asked
himself
whether
,
when
Deerfoot
was
about
to
pass
out
of
their
sight
,
his
gesticulations
did
not
signify
more
than
his
friends
supposed
.
<EOS>
“I
wonder
if
he
did
not
mean
to
tell
us
the
horse
was
not
far
off
<EOS>
:
I
believe
he
did
.
<EOS>
”“I
<EOS>
—
dinks
—
ot
—
ish
-
likely
—
vot
<EOS>
—
he
—
does
,
”
assented
Otto
,
speaking
with
such
deliberation
that
Jack
looked
in
his
face
,
laughed
and
nodded
his
head
,
approvingly
.
<EOS>
“We
shall
soon
find
out
,
for
the
trail
is
plain
and
must
be
new
.
<EOS>
”But
<EOS>
an
unpleasant
truth
forced
itself
on
their
notice
.
<EOS>
Rain
drops
were
pattering
upon
the
leaves
,
and
the
darkening
sky
presaged
a
storm
.
<EOS>
As
the
best
and
indeed
the
only
way
to
protect
themselves
against
a
good
drenching
,
the
boys
selected
a
tree
whose
foliage
was
particularly
abundant
,
and
seated
themselves
on
the
ground
with
their
backs
against
it
.
<EOS>
Then
the
blankets
were
gathered
over
their
heads
and
around
their
shoulders
,
and
they
felt
as
secure
as
if
in
their
own
log
cabins
,
miles
distant
.
<EOS>
The
rain
fell
steadily
for
nearly
two
hours
,
when
it
gradually
ceased
,
and
Jack
and
Otto
quickly
made
ready
to
resume
their
journey
.
<EOS>
The
leaves
,
twigs
and
limbs
were
dripping
with
moisture
,
so
that
,
with
the
utmost
care
,
it
was
impossible
to
advance
far
without
their
garments
becoming
saturated
.
<EOS>
That
,
however
,
was
not
a
serious
matter
,
and
caused
little
remark
.
<EOS>
For
some
rods
the
,
hoof
-
prints
of
the
horse
were
followed
,
but
then
came
the
trouble
.
<EOS>
The
rain
had
beaten
down
the
leaves
on
the
ground
with
such
force
that
even
the
keen
eyes
of
the
young
Kentuckian
began
to
doubt
.
<EOS>
Finally
the
two
paused
,
and
Otto
,
having
carefully
prepared
himself
,
<EOS>
said:“I
dinks
<EOS>
dot
ish
<EOS>
no
use
for
us
to
hunt
the
horse
.
<EOS>
”“I
am
sorry
to
give
it
up
and
own
<EOS>
we
are
beaten
,
but
that
is
what
we
shall
have
to
do
.
<EOS>
”“Vy
<EOS>
do
we
does
dot?”“We
are
trying
to
follow
a
Lost
Trail
.
<EOS>
”“If
<EOS>
we
does
dot
den
<EOS>
we
gots
lost
ourselves
.
<EOS>
”“More
<EOS>
than
likely
we
shall
,
but
I
am
afraid
that
if
we
go
home
without
the
colt
,
your
father
will
punish
you
.
<EOS>
”Otto
shrugged
his
shoulders
.
<EOS>
“It
vill
not
be
the
first
times
<EOS>
dot
he
does
dot
.
<EOS>
I
can
stand
it
,
I
dinks
.
<EOS>
”“It
will
be
a
great
pity
,
nevertheless
,
and
shall
do
my
best
to
shame
him
if
he
should
be
mean
enough
to
hold
any
such
purpose
.
”“Mebbe
<EOS>
after
we
gots
home
and
stays
one
while
,
we
start
out
agin
some
times
more
and
look
for
the
golt
.
<EOS>
”“I
have
been
thinking
of
the
same
thing
,
”
said
Jack
,
who
now
changed
their
course
with
the
view
of
reaching
home
with
the
least
possible
delay
.
<EOS>
The
boys
pushed
forward
with
so
much
energy
that
on
the
next
day
,
before
the
sun
had
reached
the
meridian
,
they
arrived
home
,
where
for
present
we
must
bid
them
good
-
bye
.
<EOS>
But
what
befell
them
and
Deerfoot
in
the
eventful
journey
which
they
speedily
ventured
upon
in
search
of
the
LOST
TRAIL
,
will
be
told
in
Number
Two
of
the
Log
Cabin
Series
,
entitled
“
CAMP
-
FIRE
AND
WIGWAM.”THE
END
