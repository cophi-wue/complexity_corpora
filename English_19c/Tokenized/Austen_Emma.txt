Emma
Woodhouse
,
handsome
,
clever
,
and
rich
,
with
a
comfortable
home
and
happy
disposition
,
seemed
to
unite
some
of
the
best
blessings
of
existence
;
and
had
lived
nearly
twenty
-
one
years
in
the
world
with
very
little
to
distress
or
vex
her
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
the
youngest
of
the
two
daughters
of
a
most
affectionate
,
indulgent
father
;
and
had
,
in
consequence
of
her
sister
's
marriage
,
been
mistress
of
his
house
from
a
very
early
period
.
<EOS>
Her
mother
had
died
too
long
ago
for
her
to
have
more
than
an
indistinct
remembrance
of
her
caresses
;
and
her
place
had
been
supplied
by
an
excellent
woman
as
governess
,
who
had
fallen
little
short
of
a
mother
in
affection
.
  
<EOS>
Sixteen
years
had
Miss
Taylor
been
in
Mr.
Woodhouse
's
family
,
less
as
a
governess
than
a
friend
,
very
fond
of
both
daughters
,
but
particularly
of
Emma
.
<EOS>
Between
_
them
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
it
was
more
the
intimacy
of
sisters
.
<EOS>
Even
before
Miss
Taylor
had
ceased
to
hold
the
nominal
office
of
governess
,
the
mildness
of
her
temper
had
hardly
allowed
her
to
impose
any
restraint
;
and
the
shadow
of
authority
being
now
long
passed
away
,
they
had
been
living
together
as
friend
and
friend
very
mutually
attached
,
and
Emma
doing
just
what
she
liked
;
highly
esteeming
Miss
Taylor
's
judgment
,
but
directed
chiefly
by
her
own
.
  
<EOS>
The
real
evils
,
indeed
,
of
Emma
's
situation
were
the
power
of
having
rather
too
much
her
own
way
,
and
a
disposition
to
think
a
little
too
well
of
herself
;
these
were
the
disadvantages
which
threatened
alloy
to
her
many
enjoyments
.
<EOS>
The
danger
,
however
,
was
at
present
so
unperceived
,
that
they
did
not
by
any
means
rank
as
misfortunes
with
her
.
  
<EOS>
Sorrow
came
 
a
gentle
sorrow
 
but
not
at
all
in
the
shape
of
any
disagreeable
consciousness
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Taylor
married
.
<EOS>
It
was
Miss
Taylor
's
loss
which
first
brought
grief
.
<EOS>
It
was
on
the
wedding
-
day
of
this
beloved
friend
that
Emma
first
sat
in
mournful
thought
of
any
continuance
.
<EOS>
The
wedding
over
,
and
the
bride
-
people
gone
,
her
father
and
herself
were
left
to
dine
together
,
with
no
prospect
of
a
third
to
cheer
a
long
evening
.
<EOS>
Her
father
composed
himself
to
sleep
after
dinner
,
as
usual
,
and
she
had
then
only
to
sit
and
think
of
what
she
had
lost
.
  
<EOS>
The
event
had
every
promise
of
happiness
for
her
friend
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Weston
was
a
man
of
unexceptionable
character
,
easy
fortune
,
suitable
age
,
and
pleasant
manners
;
and
there
was
some
satisfaction
in
considering
with
what
self
-
denying
,
generous
friendship
she
had
always
wished
and
promoted
the
match
;
but
it
was
a
black
morning
's
work
for
her
.
<EOS>
The
want
of
Miss
Taylor
would
be
felt
every
hour
of
every
day
.
<EOS>
She
recalled
her
past
kindness
 
<EOS>
the
kindness
,
the
affection
of
sixteen
years
 
how
she
had
taught
and
how
she
had
played
with
her
from
five
years
old
 
how
she
had
devoted
all
her
powers
to
attach
and
amuse
her
in
health
 
and
how
nursed
her
through
the
various
illnesses
of
childhood
.
<EOS>
A
large
debt
of
gratitude
was
owing
here
;
but
the
intercourse
of
the
last
seven
years
,
the
equal
footing
and
perfect
unreserve
which
had
soon
followed
Isabella
's
marriage
,
on
their
being
left
to
each
other
,
was
yet
a
dearer
,
tenderer
recollection
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
a
friend
and
companion
such
as
few
possessed
:
intelligent
,
well
-
informed
,
useful
,
gentle
,
knowing
all
the
ways
of
the
family
,
interested
in
all
its
concerns
,
and
peculiarly
interested
in
herself
,
in
every
pleasure
,
every
scheme
of
hers
 
one
to
whom
she
could
speak
every
thought
as
it
arose
,
and
who
had
such
an
affection
for
her
as
could
never
find
fault
.
  
<EOS>
How
was
she
to
bear
the
change
?
 
<EOS>
It
was
true
that
her
friend
was
going
only
half
a
mile
from
them
;
but
Emma
was
aware
that
great
must
be
the
difference
between
a
Mrs.
Weston
,
only
half
a
mile
from
them
,
and
a
Miss
Taylor
in
the
house
;
and
with
all
her
advantages
,
natural
and
domestic
,
she
was
now
in
great
danger
of
suffering
from
intellectual
solitude
.
<EOS>
She
dearly
loved
her
father
,
but
he
was
no
companion
for
her
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
meet
her
in
conversation
,
rational
or
playful
.
  
<EOS>
The
evil
of
the
actual
disparity
in
their
ages
(
and
Mr.
Woodhouse
had
not
married
early
)
was
much
increased
by
his
constitution
and
habits
;
for
having
been
a
valetudinarian
all
his
life
,
without
activity
of
mind
or
body
,
he
was
a
much
older
man
in
ways
than
in
years
;
and
though
everywhere
beloved
for
the
friendliness
of
his
heart
and
his
amiable
temper
,
his
talents
could
not
have
recommended
him
at
any
time
.
  
<EOS>
Her
sister
,
though
comparatively
but
little
removed
by
matrimony
,
being
settled
in
London
,
only
sixteen
miles
off
,
was
much
beyond
her
daily
reach
;
and
many
a
long
October
and
November
evening
must
be
struggled
through
at
Hartfield
,
before
Christmas
brought
the
next
visit
from
Isabella
and
her
husband
,
and
their
little
children
,
to
fill
the
house
,
and
give
her
pleasant
society
again
.
  
<EOS>
Highbury
,
the
large
and
populous
village
,
almost
amounting
to
a
town
,
to
which
Hartfield
,
in
spite
of
its
separate
lawn
,
and
shrubberies
,
and
name
,
did
really
belong
,
afforded
her
no
equals
.
<EOS>
The
Woodhouses
were
first
in
consequence
there
.
<EOS>
All
looked
up
to
them
.
<EOS>
She
had
many
acquaintance
in
the
place
,
for
her
father
was
universally
civil
,
but
not
one
among
them
who
could
be
accepted
in
lieu
of
Miss
Taylor
for
even
half
a
day
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
melancholy
change
;
and
Emma
could
not
but
sigh
over
it
,
and
wish
for
impossible
things
,
till
her
father
awoke
,
and
made
it
necessary
to
be
cheerful
.
<EOS>
His
spirits
required
support
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
nervous
man
,
easily
depressed
;
fond
of
every
body
that
he
was
used
to
,
and
hating
to
part
with
them
;
hating
change
of
every
kind
.
<EOS>
Matrimony
,
as
the
origin
of
change
,
was
always
disagreeable
;
and
he
was
by
no
means
yet
reconciled
to
his
own
daughter
's
marrying
,
nor
could
ever
speak
of
her
but
with
compassion
,
though
it
had
been
entirely
a
match
of
affection
,
when
he
was
now
obliged
to
part
with
Miss
Taylor
too
;
and
from
his
habits
of
gentle
selfishness
,
and
of
being
never
able
to
suppose
that
other
people
could
feel
differently
from
himself
,
he
was
very
much
disposed
to
think
Miss
Taylor
had
done
as
sad
a
thing
for
herself
as
for
them
,
and
would
have
been
a
great
deal
happier
if
she
had
spent
all
the
rest
of
her
life
at
Hartfield
.
<EOS>
Emma
smiled
and
chatted
as
cheerfully
as
she
could
,
to
keep
him
from
such
thoughts
;
but
when
tea
came
,
it
was
impossible
for
him
not
to
say
exactly
as
he
had
said
at
dinner
,
  
<EOS>
"
Poor
Miss
Taylor
!
 
<EOS>
I
wish
she
were
here
again
.
<EOS>
What
a
pity
it
is
that
Mr.
Weston
ever
thought
of
her
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
agree
with
you
,
papa
;
you
know
I
can
not
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Weston
is
such
a
good
-
humoured
,
pleasant
,
excellent
man
,
that
he
thoroughly
deserves
a
good
wife
;
 
and
you
would
not
have
had
Miss
Taylor
live
with
us
for
ever
,
and
bear
all
my
odd
humours
,
when
she
might
have
a
house
of
her
own
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
house
of
her
own
!
 
<EOS>
But
where
is
the
advantage
of
a
house
of
her
own
?
<EOS>
This
is
three
times
as
large
.
 
<EOS>
And
you
have
never
any
odd
humours
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
often
we
shall
be
going
to
see
them
,
and
they
coming
to
see
us
!
 
<EOS>
We
shall
be
always
meeting
!
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
We
_
must
begin
;
we
must
go
and
pay
wedding
visit
very
soon
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
how
am
I
to
get
so
far
?
<EOS>
Randalls
is
such
a
distance
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
walk
half
so
far
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
papa
,
nobody
thought
of
your
walking
.
<EOS>
We
must
go
in
the
carriage
,
to
be
sure
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
carriage
!
<EOS>
But
James
will
not
like
to
put
the
horses
to
for
such
a
little
way
;
 
and
where
are
the
poor
horses
to
be
while
we
are
paying
our
visit
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
are
to
be
put
into
Mr.
Weston
's
stable
,
papa
.
<EOS>
You
know
we
have
settled
all
that
already
.
<EOS>
We
talked
it
all
over
with
Mr.
Weston
last
night
.
<EOS>
And
as
for
James
,
you
may
be
very
sure
he
will
always
like
going
to
Randalls
,
because
of
his
daughter
's
being
housemaid
there
.
<EOS>
I
only
doubt
whether
he
will
ever
take
us
anywhere
else
.
<EOS>
That
was
your
doing
,
papa
.
<EOS>
You
got
Hannah
that
good
place
.
<EOS>
Nobody
thought
of
Hannah
till
you
mentioned
her
 
<EOS>
James
is
so
obliged
to
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
glad
I
did
think
of
her
.
<EOS>
It
was
very
lucky
,
for
I
would
not
have
had
poor
James
think
himself
slighted
upon
any
account
;
and
I
am
sure
she
will
make
a
very
good
servant
<EOS>
:
she
is
a
civil
,
pretty
-
spoken
girl
;
I
have
a
great
opinion
of
her
.
<EOS>
Whenever
I
see
her
,
she
always
curtseys
and
asks
me
how
I
do
,
in
a
very
pretty
manner
;
and
when
you
have
had
her
here
to
do
needlework
,
I
observe
she
always
turns
the
lock
of
the
door
the
right
way
and
never
bangs
it
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
she
will
be
an
excellent
servant
;
and
it
will
be
a
great
comfort
to
poor
Miss
Taylor
to
have
somebody
about
her
that
she
is
used
to
see
.
<EOS>
Whenever
James
goes
over
to
see
his
daughter
,
you
know
,
she
will
be
hearing
of
us
.
<EOS>
He
will
be
able
to
tell
her
how
we
all
are
.
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
spared
no
exertions
to
maintain
this
happier
flow
of
ideas
,
and
hoped
,
by
the
help
of
backgammon
,
to
get
her
father
tolerably
through
the
evening
,
and
be
attacked
by
no
regrets
but
her
own
.
<EOS>
The
backgammon
-
table
was
placed
;
but
a
visitor
immediately
afterwards
walked
in
and
made
it
unnecessary
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Knightley
,
a
sensible
man
about
seven
or
eight
-
and
-
thirty
,
was
not
only
a
very
old
and
intimate
friend
of
the
family
,
but
particularly
connected
with
it
,
as
the
elder
brother
of
Isabella
's
husband
.
<EOS>
He
lived
about
a
mile
from
Highbury
,
was
a
frequent
visitor
,
and
always
welcome
,
and
at
this
time
more
welcome
than
usual
,
as
coming
directly
from
their
mutual
connexions
in
London
.
<EOS>
He
had
returned
to
a
late
dinner
,
after
some
days
'
absence
,
and
now
walked
up
to
Hartfield
to
say
that
all
were
well
in
Brunswick
Square
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
happy
circumstance
,
and
animated
Mr.
Woodhouse
for
some
time
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Knightley
had
a
cheerful
manner
,
which
always
did
him
good
;
and
his
many
inquiries
after
"
poor
Isabella
"
and
her
children
were
answered
most
satisfactorily
.
<EOS>
When
this
was
over
,
Mr.
Woodhouse
gratefully
observed
,
"
It
is
very
kind
of
you
,
Mr.
Knightley
,
to
come
out
at
this
late
hour
to
call
upon
us
.
<EOS>
I
am
afraid
you
must
have
had
a
shocking
walk
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Not
at
all
,
sir
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
beautiful
moonlight
night
;
and
so
mild
that
I
must
draw
back
from
your
great
fire
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
must
have
found
it
very
damp
and
dirty
.
<EOS>
I
wish
you
may
not
catch
cold
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Dirty
,
sir
!
<EOS>
Look
at
my
shoes
.
<EOS>
Not
a
speck
on
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
that
is
quite
surprising
,
for
we
have
had
a
vast
deal
of
rain
here
.
<EOS>
It
rained
dreadfully
hard
for
half
an
hour
while
we
were
at
breakfast
.
<EOS>
I
wanted
them
to
put
off
the
wedding
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
By
the
bye
 
I
have
not
wished
you
joy
.
<EOS>
Being
pretty
well
aware
of
what
sort
of
joy
you
must
both
be
feeling
,
I
have
been
in
no
hurry
with
my
congratulations
;
but
I
hope
it
all
went
off
tolerably
well
.
<EOS>
How
did
you
all
behave
?
<EOS>
Who
cried
most
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
poor
Miss
Taylor
!
'
<EOS>
tis
a
sad
business

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Poor
Mr.
and
Miss
Woodhouse
,
if
you
please
;
but
I
can
not
possibly
say
"
poor
Miss
Taylor
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
a
great
regard
for
you
and
Emma
;
but
when
it
comes
to
the
question
of
dependence
or
independence
!
 
<EOS>
At
any
rate
,
it
must
be
better
to
have
only
one
to
please
than
two
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Especially
when
_
one
_
of
those
two
is
such
a
fanciful
,
troublesome
creature
!
"
said
Emma
playfully
.
<EOS>
"
That
is
what
you
have
in
your
head
,
I
know
 
and
what
you
would
certainly
say
if
my
father
were
not
by
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
it
is
very
true
,
my
dear
,
indeed
,
"
said
Mr.
Woodhouse
,
with
a
sigh
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
afraid
I
am
sometimes
very
fanciful
and
troublesome
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dearest
papa
!
<EOS>
You
do
not
think
I
could
mean
_
you
_
,
or
suppose
Mr.
Knightley
to
mean
_
you
_
.
<EOS>
What
a
horrible
idea
!
<EOS>
Oh
no
!
<EOS>
I
meant
only
myself
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Knightley
loves
to
find
fault
with
me
,
you
know
 
in
a
joke
 
<EOS>
it
is
all
a
joke
.
<EOS>

Mr.
Knightley
,
in
fact
,
was
one
of
the
few
people
who
could
see
faults
in
Emma
Woodhouse
,
and
the
only
one
who
ever
told
her
of
them
:
<EOS>
and
though
this
was
not
particularly
agreeable
to
Emma
herself
,
she
knew
it
would
be
so
much
less
so
to
her
father
,
that
she
would
not
have
him
really
suspect
such
a
circumstance
as
her
not
being
thought
perfect
by
every
body
.
  
<EOS>
"
Emma
knows
I
never
flatter
her
,
"
said
Mr.
Knightley
,
"
but
I
meant
no
reflection
on
any
body
.
<EOS>
Miss
Taylor
has
been
used
to
have
two
persons
to
please
;
she
will
now
have
but
one
.
<EOS>
The
chances
are
that
she
must
be
a
gainer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
said
Emma
,
willing
to
let
it
pass
 
<EOS>
"
you
want
to
hear
about
the
wedding
;
and
I
shall
be
happy
to
tell
you
,
for
we
all
behaved
charmingly
.
<EOS>
Every
body
was
punctual
,
every
body
in
their
best
looks
:
not
a
tear
,
and
hardly
a
long
face
to
be
seen
.
<EOS>
Oh
no
<EOS>
;
we
all
felt
that
we
were
going
to
be
only
half
a
mile
apart
,
and
were
sure
of
meeting
every
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Dear
Emma
bears
every
thing
so
well
,
"
said
her
father
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
,
Mr.
Knightley
,
she
is
really
very
sorry
to
lose
poor
Miss
Taylor
,
and
I
am
sure
she
_
<EOS>
will
_
miss
her
more
than
she
thinks
for
.
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
turned
away
her
head
,
divided
between
tears
and
smiles
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
impossible
that
Emma
should
not
miss
such
a
companion
,
"
said
Mr.
Knightley
.
<EOS>
"
We
should
not
like
her
so
well
as
we
do
,
sir
,
if
we
could
suppose
it
;
but
she
knows
how
much
the
marriage
is
to
Miss
Taylor
's
advantage
;
she
knows
how
very
acceptable
it
must
be
,
at
Miss
Taylor
's
time
of
life
,
to
be
settled
in
a
home
of
her
own
,
and
how
important
to
her
to
be
secure
of
a
comfortable
provision
,
and
therefore
can
not
allow
herself
to
feel
so
much
pain
as
pleasure
.
<EOS>
Every
friend
of
Miss
Taylor
must
be
glad
to
have
her
so
happily
married
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
have
forgotten
one
matter
of
joy
to
me
,
"
said
Emma
,
"
and
a
very
considerable
one
 
that
I
made
the
match
myself
.
<EOS>
I
made
the
match
,
you
know
,
four
years
ago
;
and
to
have
it
take
place
,
and
be
proved
in
the
right
,
when
so
many
people
said
Mr.
Weston
would
never
marry
again
,
may
comfort
me
for
any
thing
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Knightley
shook
his
head
at
her
.
<EOS>
Her
father
fondly
replied
,
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
my
dear
,
I
wish
you
would
not
make
matches
and
foretell
things
,
for
whatever
you
say
always
comes
to
pass
.
<EOS>
Pray
do
not
make
any
more
matches
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
promise
you
to
make
none
for
myself
,
papa
;
but
I
must
,
indeed
,
for
other
people
.
<EOS>
It
is
the
greatest
amusement
in
the
world
!
<EOS>
And
after
such
success
,
you
know
!
 
<EOS>
Every
body
said
that
Mr.
Weston
would
never
marry
again
.
<EOS>
Oh
dear
,
no
!
<EOS>
Mr.
Weston
,
who
had
been
a
widower
so
long
,
and
who
seemed
so
perfectly
comfortable
without
a
wife
,
so
constantly
occupied
either
in
his
business
in
town
or
among
his
friends
here
,
always
acceptable
wherever
he
went
,
always
cheerful
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Weston
need
not
spend
a
single
evening
in
the
year
alone
if
he
did
not
like
it
.
<EOS>
Oh
no
!
<EOS>
Mr.
Weston
certainly
would
never
marry
again
.
<EOS>
Some
people
even
talked
of
a
promise
to
his
wife
on
her
deathbed
,
and
others
of
the
son
and
the
uncle
not
letting
him
.
<EOS>
All
manner
of
solemn
nonsense
was
talked
on
the
subject
,
but
I
believed
none
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ever
since
the
day
 
about
four
years
ago
 
that
Miss
Taylor
and
I
met
with
him
in
Broadway
Lane
,
when
,
because
it
began
to
drizzle
,
he
darted
away
with
so
much
gallantry
,
and
borrowed
two
umbrellas
for
us
from
Farmer
Mitchell
's
,
I
made
up
my
mind
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
I
planned
the
match
from
that
hour
;
and
when
such
success
has
blessed
me
in
this
instance
,
dear
papa
,
you
can
not
think
that
I
shall
leave
off
match
-
making
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
understand
what
you
mean
by
"
success
,
"
"
said
Mr.
Knightley
.
<EOS>
"
Success
supposes
endeavour
.
<EOS>
Your
time
has
been
properly
and
delicately
spent
,
if
you
have
been
endeavouring
for
the
last
four
years
to
bring
about
this
marriage
.
<EOS>
A
worthy
employment
for
a
young
lady
's
mind
!
<EOS>
But
if
,
which
I
rather
imagine
,
your
making
the
match
,
as
you
call
it
,
means
only
your
planning
it
,
your
saying
to
yourself
one
idle
day
,
"
I
think
it
would
be
a
very
good
thing
for
Miss
Taylor
if
Mr.
Weston
were
to
marry
her
,
"
and
saying
it
again
to
yourself
every
now
<EOS>
and
then
afterwards
,
why
do
you
talk
of
success
?
<EOS>
Where
is
your
merit
?
<EOS>
What
are
you
proud
of
?
<EOS>
You
made
a
lucky
guess
;
and
_
that
_
is
all
that
can
be
said
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
have
you
never
known
the
pleasure
and
triumph
of
a
lucky
guess
?
 
<EOS>
I
pity
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
thought
you
cleverer
 
for
,
depend
upon
it
a
lucky
guess
is
never
merely
luck
.
<EOS>
There
is
always
some
talent
in
it
.
<EOS>
And
as
to
my
poor
word
"
success
,
"
which
you
quarrel
with
,
I
do
not
know
that
I
am
so
entirely
without
any
claim
to
it
.
<EOS>
You
have
drawn
two
pretty
pictures
;
but
I
think
there
may
be
a
third
 
a
something
between
the
do
-
nothing
and
the
do
-
all
.
<EOS>
If
I
had
not
promoted
Mr.
Weston
's
visits
here
,
and
given
many
little
encouragements
,
and
smoothed
many
little
matters
,
it
might
not
have
come
to
any
thing
after
all
.
<EOS>
I
think
you
must
know
Hartfield
enough
to
comprehend
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
straightforward
,
open
-
hearted
man
like
Weston
,
and
a
rational
,
unaffected
woman
like
Miss
Taylor
,
may
be
safely
left
to
manage
their
own
concerns

You
are
more
likely
to
have
done
harm

yourself

rejoined
Mr.
Woodhouse
,
understanding
but
in
part

But
,
my
dear
,
pray
do
not
make
any
more
matches

they
are
silly
things

up

<EOS>
You
like
Mr.
Elton
,
papa

I
must
look
about
for
a
wife
for
him

<EOS>
There
is
nobody
in
Highbury
who
deserves
him
 
and
he
has
been
here
a
whole
year
,
and
has
fitted
up
his
house
so
comfortably
,
that
it
would
be
a
shame
to
have
him
single
any
longer
 
<EOS>

I
thought
when
he
was
joining
their
hands
to

day

he
looked
so
very
much
as

he
would
like
to

<EOS>
I
think
very
well
of
Mr.

and
this
is
the
only
way
I
have
of
doing
him
a
service

Mr.
Elton

very
pretty
young

and
a
very
good
young
man

I
have
a
great
regard

But
if
you
want
to
shew
him
any
attention

my

ask
him
to
come
and
dine
with
us
some
day

That

kind

<EOS>
"
With
a
great
deal
of
pleasure

at
any
time

said
Mr.
Knightley
,
laughing
,
"
<EOS>
and
I
agree
with
you
entirely
,
that
it
will
be
a
much
better
thing

Invite
him
to
dinner

Emma

and
help
him
to
the
best
of
the
fish
and
the
chicken

but
leave
him
to
chuse
his
own
wife

<EOS>
Depend
upon
it
,
a
man
of
six
or
seven
-
and
-
twenty
can
take
care
of
himself

<EOS>
Mr.
Weston
was
a
native
of
Highbury
,
and
born
of
a
respectable
family
,
which
for
the
last
two
or
three
generations
had
been
rising
into
gentility
and
property
.
<EOS>
He
had
received
a
good
education
,
but
,
on
succeeding
early
in
life
to
a
small
independence
,
had
become
indisposed
for
any
of
the
more
homely
pursuits
in
which
his
brothers
were
engaged
,
and
had
satisfied
an
active
,
cheerful
mind
and
social
temper
by
entering
into
the
militia
of
his
county
,
then
embodied
.
  
<EOS>
Captain
Weston
was
a
general
favourite
;
and
when
the
chances
of
his
military
life
had
introduced
him
to
Miss
Churchill
,
of
a
great
Yorkshire
family
,
and
Miss
Churchill
fell
in
love
with
him
,
nobody
was
surprized
,
except
her
brother
and
his
wife
,
who
had
never
seen
him
,
and
who
were
full
of
pride
and
importance
,
which
the
connexion
would
offend
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Churchill
,
however
,
being
of
age
,
and
with
the
full
command
of
her
fortune
 
though
her
fortune
bore
no
proportion
to
the
family
-
estate
 
<EOS>
was
not
to
be
dissuaded
from
the
marriage
,
and
it
took
place
,
to
the
infinite
mortification
of
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Churchill
,
who
threw
her
off
with
due
decorum
.
<EOS>
It
was
an
unsuitable
connexion
,
and
did
not
produce
much
happiness
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Weston
ought
to
have
found
more
in
it
,
for
she
had
a
husband
whose
warm
heart
and
sweet
temper
made
him
think
every
thing
due
to
her
in
return
for
the
great
goodness
of
being
in
love
with
him
;
but
though
she
had
one
sort
of
spirit
,
she
had
not
the
best
.
<EOS>
She
had
resolution
enough
to
pursue
her
own
will
in
spite
of
her
brother
,
but
not
enough
to
refrain
from
unreasonable
regrets
at
that
brother
's
unreasonable
anger
,
nor
from
missing
the
luxuries
of
her
former
home
.
<EOS>
They
lived
beyond
their
income
,
but
still
it
was
nothing
in
comparison
of
Enscombe
<EOS>
:
she
did
not
cease
to
love
her
husband
,
but
she
wanted
at
once
to
be
the
wife
of
Captain
Weston
,
and
Miss
Churchill
of
Enscombe
.
  
<EOS>
Captain
Weston
,
who
had
been
considered
,
especially
by
the
Churchills
,
as
making
such
an
amazing
match
,
was
proved
to
have
much
the
worst
of
the
bargain
;
for
when
his
wife
died
,
after
a
three
years
'
marriage
,
he
was
rather
a
poorer
man
than
at
first
,
and
with
a
child
to
maintain
.
<EOS>
From
the
expense
of
the
child
,
however
,
he
was
soon
relieved
.
<EOS>
The
boy
had
,
with
the
additional
softening
claim
of
a
lingering
illness
of
his
mother
's
,
been
the
means
of
a
sort
of
reconciliation
;
and
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Churchill
,
having
no
children
of
their
own
,
nor
any
other
young
creature
of
equal
kindred
to
care
for
,
offered
to
take
the
whole
charge
of
the
little
Frank
soon
after
her
decease
.
<EOS>
Some
scruples
and
some
reluctance
the
widower
-
father
may
be
supposed
to
have
felt
;
but
as
they
were
overcome
by
other
considerations
,
the
child
was
given
up
to
the
care
and
the
wealth
of
the
Churchills
,
and
he
had
only
his
own
comfort
to
seek
,
and
his
own
situation
to
improve
as
he
could
.
  
<EOS>
A
complete
change
of
life
became
desirable
.
<EOS>
He
quitted
the
militia
and
engaged
in
trade
,
having
brothers
already
established
in
a
good
way
in
London
,
which
afforded
him
a
favourable
opening
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
concern
which
brought
just
employment
enough
.
<EOS>
He
had
still
a
small
house
in
Highbury
,
where
most
of
his
leisure
days
were
spent
;
and
between
useful
occupation
and
the
pleasures
of
society
,
the
next
eighteen
or
twenty
years
of
his
life
passed
cheerfully
away
.
<EOS>
He
had
,
by
that
time
,
realised
an
easy
competence
 
enough
to
secure
the
purchase
of
a
little
estate
adjoining
Highbury
,
which
he
had
always
longed
for
 
enough
to
marry
a
woman
as
portionless
even
as
Miss
Taylor
,
and
to
live
according
to
the
wishes
of
his
own
friendly
and
social
disposition
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
now
some
time
since
Miss
Taylor
had
begun
to
influence
his
schemes
;
but
as
it
was
not
the
tyrannic
influence
of
youth
on
youth
,
it
had
not
shaken
his
determination
of
never
settling
till
he
could
purchase
Randalls
,
and
the
sale
of
Randalls
was
long
looked
forward
to
;
but
he
had
gone
steadily
on
,
with
these
objects
in
view
,
till
they
were
accomplished
.
<EOS>
He
had
made
his
fortune
,
bought
his
house
,
and
obtained
his
wife
;
and
was
beginning
a
new
period
of
existence
,
with
every
probability
of
greater
happiness
than
in
any
yet
passed
through
.
<EOS>
He
had
never
been
an
unhappy
man
;
his
own
temper
had
secured
him
from
that
,
even
in
his
first
marriage
;
but
his
second
must
shew
him
how
delightful
a
well
-
judging
and
truly
amiable
woman
could
be
,
and
must
give
him
the
pleasantest
proof
of
its
being
a
great
deal
better
to
choose
than
to
be
chosen
,
to
excite
gratitude
than
to
feel
it
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
only
himself
to
please
in
his
choice
:
his
fortune
was
his
own
;
for
as
to
Frank
,
it
was
more
than
being
tacitly
brought
up
as
his
uncle
's
heir
,
it
had
become
so
avowed
an
adoption
as
to
have
him
assume
the
name
of
Churchill
on
coming
of
age
.
<EOS>
It
was
most
unlikely
,
therefore
,
that
he
should
ever
want
his
father
's
assistance
.
<EOS>
His
father
had
no
apprehension
of
it
.
<EOS>
The
aunt
was
a
capricious
woman
,
and
governed
her
husband
entirely
;
but
it
was
not
in
Mr.
Weston
's
nature
to
imagine
that
any
caprice
could
be
strong
enough
to
affect
one
so
dear
,
and
,
as
he
believed
,
so
deservedly
dear
.
<EOS>
He
saw
his
son
every
year
in
London
,
and
was
proud
of
him
;
and
his
fond
report
of
him
as
a
very
fine
young
man
had
made
Highbury
feel
a
sort
of
pride
in
him
too
.
<EOS>
He
was
looked
on
as
sufficiently
belonging
to
the
place
to
make
his
merits
and
prospects
a
kind
of
common
concern
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
was
one
of
the
boasts
of
Highbury
,
and
a
lively
curiosity
to
see
him
prevailed
,
though
the
compliment
was
so
little
returned
that
he
had
never
been
there
in
his
life
.
<EOS>
His
coming
to
visit
his
father
had
been
often
talked
of
but
never
achieved
.
  
<EOS>
Now
,
upon
his
father
's
marriage
,
it
was
very
generally
proposed
,
as
a
most
proper
attention
,
that
the
visit
should
take
place
.
<EOS>
There
was
not
a
dissentient
voice
on
the
subject
,
either
when
Mrs.
Perry
drank
tea
with
Mrs.
and
Miss
Bates
,
or
when
Mrs.
and
Miss
Bates
returned
the
visit
.
<EOS>
Now
was
the
time
for
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
to
come
among
them
;
and
the
hope
strengthened
when
it
was
understood
that
he
had
written
to
his
new
mother
on
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
For
a
few
days
,
every
morning
visit
in
Highbury
included
some
mention
of
the
handsome
letter
Mrs.
Weston
had
received
.
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
you
have
heard
of
the
handsome
letter
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
has
written
to
Mrs.
Weston
?
<EOS>
I
understand
it
was
a
very
handsome
letter
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Woodhouse
told
me
of
it
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Woodhouse
saw
the
letter
,
and
he
says
he
never
saw
such
a
handsome
letter
in
his
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
,
indeed
,
a
highly
prized
letter
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Weston
had
,
of
course
,
formed
a
very
favourable
idea
of
the
young
man
;
and
such
a
pleasing
attention
was
an
irresistible
proof
of
his
great
good
sense
,
and
a
most
welcome
addition
to
every
source
and
every
expression
of
congratulation
which
her
marriage
had
already
secured
.
<EOS>
She
felt
herself
a
most
fortunate
woman
;
and
she
had
lived
long
enough
to
know
how
fortunate
she
might
well
be
thought
,
where
the
only
regret
was
for
a
partial
separation
from
friends
whose
friendship
for
her
had
never
cooled
,
and
who
could
ill
bear
to
part
with
her
.
  
<EOS>
She
knew
that
at
times
she
must
be
missed
;
and
could
not
think
,
without
pain
,
of
Emma
's
losing
a
single
pleasure
,
or
suffering
an
hour
's
ennui
,
from
the
want
of
her
companionableness
:
<EOS>
but
dear
Emma
was
of
no
feeble
character
;
she
was
more
equal
to
her
situation
than
most
girls
would
have
been
,
and
had
sense
,
and
energy
,
and
spirits
that
might
be
hoped
would
bear
her
well
and
happily
through
its
little
difficulties
and
privations
.
<EOS>
And
then
there
was
such
comfort
in
the
very
easy
distance
of
Randalls
from
Hartfield
,
so
convenient
for
even
solitary
female
walking
,
and
in
Mr.
Weston
's
disposition
and
circumstances
,
which
would
make
the
approaching
season
no
hindrance
to
their
spending
half
the
evenings
in
the
week
together
.
  
<EOS>
Her
situation
was
altogether
the
subject
of
hours
of
gratitude
to
Mrs.
Weston
,
and
of
moments
only
of
regret
;
and
her
satisfaction
 
her
more
than
satisfaction
 
her
cheerful
enjoyment
,
was
so
just
and
so
apparent
,
<EOS>
that
Emma
,
well
as
she
knew
her
father
,
was
sometimes
taken
by
surprize
at
his
being
still
able
to
pity
"
poor
Miss
Taylor
,
"
when
they
left
her
at
Randalls
in
the
centre
of
every
domestic
comfort
,
or
saw
her
go
away
in
the
evening
attended
by
her
pleasant
husband
to
a
carriage
of
her
own
.
<EOS>
But
never
did
she
go
without
Mr.
Woodhouse
's
giving
a
gentle
sigh
,
and
saying
,
"
Ah
,
poor
Miss
Taylor
!
<EOS>
She
would
be
very
glad
to
stay
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
no
recovering
Miss
Taylor
 
nor
much
likelihood
of
ceasing
to
pity
her
;
but
a
few
weeks
brought
some
alleviation
to
Mr.
Woodhouse
.
<EOS>
The
compliments
of
his
neighbours
were
over
;
he
was
no
longer
teased
by
being
wished
joy
of
so
sorrowful
an
event
;
and
the
wedding
-
cake
,
which
had
been
a
great
distress
to
him
,
was
all
eat
up
.
<EOS>
His
own
stomach
could
bear
nothing
rich
,
and
he
could
never
believe
other
people
to
be
different
from
himself
.
<EOS>
What
was
unwholesome
to
him
he
regarded
as
unfit
for
any
body
;
and
he
had
,
therefore
,
earnestly
tried
to
dissuade
them
from
having
any
wedding
-
cake
at
all
,
and
when
that
proved
vain
,
as
earnestly
tried
to
prevent
any
body
's
eating
it
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
at
the
pains
of
consulting
Mr.
Perry
,
the
apothecary
,
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Perry
was
an
intelligent
,
gentlemanlike
man
,
whose
frequent
visits
were
one
of
the
comforts
of
Mr.
Woodhouse
's
life
;
and
upon
being
applied
to
,
he
could
not
but
acknowledge
(
though
it
seemed
rather
against
the
bias
of
inclination
)
that
wedding
-
cake
might
certainly
disagree
with
many
 
perhaps
with
most
people
,
unless
taken
moderately
.
<EOS>
With
such
an
opinion
,
in
confirmation
of
his
own
,
Mr.
Woodhouse
hoped
to
influence
every
visitor
of
the
newly
married
pair
;
but
still
the
cake
was
eaten
;
and
there
was
no
rest
for
his
benevolent
nerves
till
it
was
all
gone
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
strange
rumour
in
Highbury
of
all
the
little
Perrys
being
seen
with
a
slice
of
Mrs.
Weston
's
wedding
-
cake
in
their
hands
:
but
Mr.
Woodhouse
would
never
believe
it
.
    
<EOS>
Mr.
Woodhouse
was
fond
of
society
in
his
own
way
.
<EOS>
He
liked
very
much
to
have
his
friends
come
and
see
him
;
and
from
various
united
causes
,
from
his
long
residence
at
Hartfield
,
and
his
good
nature
,
from
his
fortune
,
his
house
,
and
his
daughter
,
he
could
command
the
visits
of
his
own
little
circle
,
in
a
great
measure
,
as
he
liked
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
much
intercourse
with
any
families
beyond
that
circle
;
his
horror
of
late
hours
,
and
large
dinner
-
parties
,
made
him
unfit
for
any
acquaintance
but
such
as
would
visit
him
on
his
own
terms
.
<EOS>
Fortunately
for
him
,
Highbury
,
including
Randalls
in
the
same
parish
,
and
Donwell
Abbey
in
the
parish
adjoining
,
the
seat
of
Mr.
Knightley
,
comprehended
many
such
.
<EOS>
Not
unfrequently
,
through
Emma
's
persuasion
,
he
had
some
of
the
chosen
and
the
best
to
dine
with
him
:
but
evening
parties
were
what
he
preferred
;
and
,
unless
he
fancied
himself
at
any
time
unequal
to
company
,
there
was
scarcely
an
evening
in
the
week
in
which
Emma
could
not
make
up
a
card
-
table
for
him
.
  
<EOS>
Real
,
long
-
standing
regard
brought
the
Westons
and
Mr.
Knightley
;
and
by
Mr.
Elton
,
a
young
man
living
alone
without
liking
it
,
the
privilege
of
exchanging
any
vacant
evening
of
his
own
blank
solitude
for
the
elegancies
and
society
of
Mr.
Woodhouse
's
drawing
-
room
,
and
the
smiles
of
his
lovely
daughter
,
was
in
no
danger
of
being
thrown
away
.
  
<EOS>
After
these
came
a
second
set
;
among
the
most
come
-
at
-
able
of
whom
were
Mrs.
and
Miss
Bates
,
and
Mrs.
Goddard
,
three
ladies
almost
always
at
the
service
of
an
invitation
from
Hartfield
,
and
who
were
fetched
and
carried
home
so
often
,
that
Mr.
Woodhouse
thought
it
no
hardship
for
either
James
or
the
horses
.
<EOS>
Had
it
taken
place
only
once
a
year
,
it
would
have
been
a
grievance
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bates
,
the
widow
of
a
former
vicar
of
Highbury
,
was
a
very
old
lady
,
almost
past
every
thing
but
tea
and
quadrille
.
<EOS>
She
lived
with
her
single
daughter
in
a
very
small
way
,
and
was
considered
with
all
the
regard
and
respect
which
a
harmless
old
lady
,
under
such
untoward
circumstances
,
can
excite
.
<EOS>
Her
daughter
enjoyed
a
most
uncommon
degree
of
popularity
for
a
woman
neither
young
,
handsome
,
rich
,
nor
married
.
<EOS>
Miss
Bates
stood
in
the
very
worst
predicament
in
the
world
for
having
much
of
the
public
favour
;
and
she
had
no
intellectual
superiority
to
make
atonement
to
herself
,
or
frighten
those
who
might
hate
her
into
outward
respect
.
<EOS>
She
had
never
boasted
either
beauty
or
cleverness
.
<EOS>
Her
youth
had
passed
without
distinction
,
and
her
middle
of
life
was
devoted
to
the
care
of
a
failing
mother
,
and
the
endeavour
to
make
a
small
income
go
as
far
as
possible
.
<EOS>
And
yet
she
was
a
happy
woman
,
and
a
woman
whom
no
one
named
without
good
-
will
.
<EOS>
It
was
her
own
universal
good
-
will
and
contented
temper
which
worked
such
wonders
.
<EOS>
She
loved
every
body
,
was
interested
in
every
body
's
happiness
,
quicksighted
to
every
body
's
merits
;
thought
herself
a
most
fortunate
creature
,
and
surrounded
with
blessings
in
such
an
excellent
mother
,
and
so
many
good
neighbours
and
friends
,
and
a
home
that
wanted
for
nothing
.
<EOS>
The
simplicity
and
cheerfulness
of
her
nature
,
her
contented
and
grateful
spirit
,
were
a
recommendation
to
every
body
,
and
a
mine
of
felicity
to
herself
.
<EOS>
She
was
a
great
talker
upon
little
matters
,
which
exactly
suited
Mr.
Woodhouse
,
full
of
trivial
communications
and
harmless
gossip
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Goddard
was
the
mistress
of
a
School
 
not
of
a
seminary
,
or
an
establishment
,
or
any
thing
which
professed
,
in
long
sentences
of
refined
nonsense
,
to
combine
liberal
acquirements
with
elegant
morality
,
upon
new
principles
and
new
systems
 
and
where
young
ladies
for
enormous
pay
might
be
screwed
out
of
health
and
into
vanity
 
but
a
real
,
honest
,
old
-
fashioned
Boarding
-
school
,
where
a
reasonable
quantity
of
accomplishments
were
sold
at
a
reasonable
price
,
and
where
girls
might
be
sent
to
be
out
of
the
way
,
and
scramble
themselves
into
a
little
education
,
without
any
danger
of
coming
back
prodigies
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Goddard
's
school
was
in
high
repute
 
and
very
deservedly
;
for
Highbury
was
reckoned
a
particularly
healthy
spot
:
she
had
an
ample
house
and
garden
,
gave
the
children
plenty
of
wholesome
food
,
let
them
run
about
a
great
deal
in
the
summer
,
and
in
winter
dressed
their
chilblains
with
her
own
hands
.
<EOS>
It
was
no
wonder
that
a
train
of
twenty
young
couple
now
walked
after
her
to
church
.
<EOS>
She
was
a
plain
,
motherly
kind
of
woman
,
who
had
worked
hard
in
her
youth
,
and
now
thought
herself
entitled
to
the
occasional
holiday
of
a
tea
-
visit
;
and
having
formerly
owed
much
to
Mr.
Woodhouse
's
kindness
,
felt
his
particular
claim
on
her
to
leave
her
neat
parlour
,
hung
round
with
fancy
-
work
,
whenever
she
could
,
and
win
or
lose
a
few
sixpences
by
his
fireside
.
  
<EOS>
These
were
the
ladies
whom
Emma
found
herself
very
frequently
able
to
collect
;
and
happy
was
she
,
for
her
father
's
sake
,
in
the
power
;
though
,
as
far
as
she
was
herself
concerned
,
it
was
no
remedy
for
the
absence
of
Mrs.
Weston
.
<EOS>
She
was
delighted
to
see
her
father
look
comfortable
,
and
very
much
pleased
with
herself
for
contriving
things
so
well
;
but
the
quiet
prosings
of
three
such
women
made
her
feel
that
every
evening
so
spent
was
indeed
one
of
the
long
evenings
she
had
fearfully
anticipated
.
  
<EOS>
As
she
sat
one
morning
,
looking
forward
to
exactly
such
a
close
of
the
present
day
,
a
note
was
brought
from
Mrs.
Goddard
,
requesting
,
in
most
respectful
terms
,
to
be
allowed
to
bring
Miss
Smith
with
her
;
a
most
welcome
request
:
for
Miss
Smith
was
a
girl
of
seventeen
,
whom
Emma
knew
very
well
by
sight
,
and
had
long
felt
an
interest
in
,
on
account
of
her
beauty
.
<EOS>
A
very
gracious
invitation
was
returned
,
and
the
evening
no
longer
dreaded
by
the
fair
mistress
of
the
mansion
.
  
<EOS>
Harriet
Smith
was
the
natural
daughter
of
somebody
.
<EOS>
Somebody
had
placed
her
,
several
years
back
,
at
Mrs.
Goddard
's
school
,
and
somebody
had
lately
raised
her
from
the
condition
of
scholar
to
that
of
parlour
-
boarder
.
<EOS>
This
was
all
that
was
generally
known
of
her
history
.
<EOS>
She
had
no
visible
friends
but
what
had
been
acquired
at
Highbury
,
and
was
now
just
returned
from
a
long
visit
in
the
country
to
some
young
ladies
who
had
been
at
school
there
with
her
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
a
very
pretty
girl
,
and
her
beauty
happened
to
be
of
a
sort
which
Emma
particularly
admired
.
<EOS>
She
was
short
,
plump
,
and
fair
,
with
a
fine
bloom
,
blue
eyes
,
light
hair
,
regular
features
,
and
a
look
of
great
sweetness
,
and
,
before
the
end
of
the
evening
,
Emma
was
as
much
pleased
with
her
manners
as
her
person
,
and
quite
determined
to
continue
the
acquaintance
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
not
struck
by
any
thing
remarkably
clever
in
Miss
Smith
's
conversation
,
but
she
found
her
altogether
very
engaging
 
not
inconveniently
shy
,
not
unwilling
to
talk
 
and
yet
so
far
from
pushing
,
shewing
so
proper
and
becoming
a
deference
,
seeming
so
pleasantly
grateful
for
being
admitted
to
Hartfield
,
and
so
artlessly
impressed
by
the
appearance
of
every
thing
in
so
superior
a
style
to
what
she
had
been
used
to
,
that
she
must
have
good
sense
,
and
deserve
encouragement
.
<EOS>
Encouragement
should
be
given
.
<EOS>
Those
soft
blue
eyes
,
and
all
those
natural
graces
,
should
not
be
wasted
on
the
inferior
society
of
Highbury
and
its
connexions
.
<EOS>
The
acquaintance
she
had
already
formed
were
unworthy
of
her
.
<EOS>
The
friends
from
whom
she
had
just
parted
,
though
very
good
sort
of
people
,
must
be
doing
her
harm
.
<EOS>
They
were
a
family
of
the
name
of
Martin
,
whom
Emma
well
knew
by
character
,
as
renting
a
large
farm
of
Mr.
Knightley
,
and
residing
in
the
parish
of
Donwell
 
very
creditably
,
she
believed
 
she
knew
Mr.
Knightley
thought
highly
of
them
 
<EOS>
but
they
must
be
coarse
and
unpolished
,
and
very
unfit
to
be
the
intimates
of
a
girl
who
wanted
only
a
little
more
knowledge
and
elegance
to
be
quite
perfect
.
<EOS>
_
She
_
would
notice
her
;
she
would
improve
her
;
she
would
detach
her
from
her
bad
acquaintance
,
and
introduce
her
into
good
society
;
she
would
form
her
opinions
and
her
manners
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
an
interesting
,
and
certainly
a
very
kind
undertaking
;
highly
becoming
her
own
situation
in
life
,
her
leisure
,
and
powers
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
so
busy
in
admiring
those
soft
blue
eyes
,
in
talking
and
listening
,
and
forming
all
these
schemes
in
the
in
-
betweens
,
that
the
evening
flew
away
at
a
very
unusual
rate
;
and
the
supper
-
table
,
which
always
closed
such
parties
,
and
for
which
she
had
been
used
to
sit
and
watch
the
due
time
,
was
all
set
out
and
ready
,
and
moved
forwards
to
the
fire
,
before
she
was
aware
.
<EOS>
With
an
alacrity
beyond
the
common
impulse
of
a
spirit
which
yet
was
never
indifferent
to
the
credit
of
doing
every
thing
well
and
attentively
,
with
the
real
good
-
will
of
a
mind
delighted
with
its
own
ideas
,
did
she
then
do
all
the
honours
of
the
meal
,
and
help
and
recommend
the
minced
chicken
and
scalloped
oysters
,
with
an
urgency
which
she
knew
would
be
acceptable
to
the
early
hours
and
civil
scruples
of
their
guests
.
  
<EOS>
Upon
such
occasions
poor
<EOS>
Mr.
Woodhouses
feelings
were
in
sad
warfare
.
<EOS>
He
loved
to
have
the
cloth
laid
,
because
it
had
been
the
fashion
of
his
youth
,
but
his
conviction
of
suppers
being
very
unwholesome
made
him
rather
sorry
to
see
any
thing
put
on
it
;
and
while
his
hospitality
would
have
welcomed
his
visitors
to
every
thing
,
his
care
for
their
health
made
him
grieve
that
they
would
eat
.
  
<EOS>
Such
another
small
basin
of
thin
gruel
as
his
own
was
all
that
he
could
,
with
thorough
self
-
approbation
,
recommend
;
though
he
might
constrain
himself
,
while
the
ladies
were
comfortably
clearing
the
nicer
things
,
to
say
:
  
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bates
,
let
me
propose
your
venturing
on
one
of
these
eggs
.
<EOS>
An
egg
boiled
very
soft
is
not
unwholesome
.
<EOS>
Serle
understands
boiling
an
egg
better
than
any
body
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
recommend
an
egg
boiled
by
any
body
else
;
but
you
need
not
be
afraid
,
they
are
very
small
,
you
see
 
one
of
our
small
eggs
will
not
hurt
you
.
<EOS>
Miss
Bates
,
let
Emma
help
you
to
a
_
little
_
bit
of
tart
 
<EOS>
a
_
<EOS>
very
_
little
bit
.
<EOS>
Ours
are
all
apple
-
tarts
.
<EOS>
You
need
not
be
afraid
of
unwholesome
preserves
here
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
advise
the
custard
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Goddard
,
what
say
you
to
_
half
_
<EOS>
a
glass
of
wine
?
<EOS>
A
_
small
_
half
-
glass
,
put
into
a
tumbler
of
water
?
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
it
could
disagree
with
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
allowed
her
father
to
talk
 
but
supplied
her
visitors
in
a
much
more
satisfactory
style
,
and
on
the
present
evening
had
particular
pleasure
in
sending
them
away
happy
.
<EOS>
The
happiness
of
Miss
Smith
was
quite
equal
to
her
intentions
.
<EOS>
Miss
Woodhouse
was
so
great
a
personage
in
Highbury
,
that
the
prospect
of
the
introduction
had
given
as
much
panic
as
pleasure
;
but
the
humble
,
grateful
little
girl
went
off
with
highly
gratified
feelings
,
delighted
with
the
affability
with
which
Miss
Woodhouse
had
treated
her
all
the
evening
,
and
actually
shaken
hands
with
her
at
last
!
    
<EOS>
Harriet
Smith
's
intimacy
at
Hartfield
was
soon
a
settled
thing
.
<EOS>
Quick
and
decided
in
her
ways
,
Emma
lost
no
time
in
inviting
,
encouraging
,
and
telling
her
to
come
very
often
;
and
as
their
acquaintance
increased
,
so
did
their
satisfaction
in
each
other
.
<EOS>
As
a
walking
companion
,
Emma
had
very
early
foreseen
how
useful
she
might
find
her
.
<EOS>
In
that
respect
Mrs.
Weston
's
loss
had
been
important
.
<EOS>
Her
father
never
went
beyond
the
shrubbery
,
where
two
divisions
of
the
ground
sufficed
him
for
his
long
walk
,
or
his
short
,
as
the
year
varied
;
and
since
Mrs.
Weston
's
marriage
her
exercise
had
been
too
much
confined
.
<EOS>
She
had
ventured
once
alone
to
Randalls
,
but
it
was
not
pleasant
;
and
a
Harriet
Smith
,
therefore
,
one
whom
she
could
summon
at
any
time
to
a
walk
,
would
be
a
valuable
addition
to
her
privileges
.
<EOS>
But
in
every
respect
,
as
she
saw
more
of
her
,
she
approved
her
,
and
was
confirmed
in
all
her
kind
designs
.
  
<EOS>
Harriet
certainly
was
not
clever
,
but
she
had
a
sweet
,
docile
,
grateful
disposition
,
was
totally
free
from
conceit
,
and
only
desiring
to
be
guided
by
any
one
she
looked
up
to
.
<EOS>
Her
early
attachment
to
herself
was
very
amiable
;
and
her
inclination
for
good
company
,
and
power
of
appreciating
what
was
elegant
and
clever
,
shewed
that
there
was
no
want
of
taste
,
though
strength
of
understanding
must
not
be
expected
.
<EOS>
Altogether
she
was
quite
convinced
of
Harriet
Smith
's
being
exactly
the
young
friend
<EOS>
she
wanted
 
exactly
the
something
which
her
home
required
.
<EOS>
Such
a
friend
as
Mrs.
Weston
was
out
of
the
question
.
<EOS>
Two
such
could
never
be
granted
.
<EOS>
Two
such
she
did
not
want
.
<EOS>
It
was
quite
a
different
sort
of
thing
,
a
sentiment
distinct
and
independent
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Weston
was
the
object
of
a
regard
which
had
its
basis
in
gratitude
and
esteem
.
<EOS>
Harriet
would
be
loved
as
one
to
whom
she
could
be
useful
.
<EOS>
For
Mrs.
Weston
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
;
for
Harriet
every
thing
.
  
<EOS>
Her
first
attempts
at
usefulness
were
in
an
endeavour
to
find
out
who
were
the
parents
,
but
Harriet
could
not
tell
.
<EOS>
She
was
ready
to
tell
every
thing
in
her
power
,
but
on
this
subject
questions
were
vain
.
<EOS>
Emma
was
obliged
to
fancy
what
she
liked
 
<EOS>
but
she
could
never
believe
that
in
the
same
situation
_
she
_
should
not
have
discovered
the
truth
.
<EOS>
Harriet
had
no
penetration
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
satisfied
to
hear
and
believe
just
what
Mrs.
Goddard
chose
to
tell
her
;
and
looked
no
farther
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Goddard
,
and
the
teachers
,
and
the
girls
and
the
affairs
of
the
school
in
general
,
formed
naturally
a
great
part
of
the
conversation
 
and
but
for
her
acquaintance
with
the
Martins
of
Abbey
-
Mill
Farm
,
it
must
have
been
the
whole
.
<EOS>
But
the
Martins
occupied
her
thoughts
a
good
deal
;
she
had
spent
two
very
happy
months
with
them
,
and
now
loved
to
talk
of
the
pleasures
of
her
visit
,
and
describe
the
many
comforts
and
wonders
of
the
place
.
<EOS>
Emma
encouraged
her
talkativeness
 
amused
by
such
a
picture
of
another
set
of
beings
,
and
enjoying
the
youthful
simplicity
which
could
speak
with
so
much
exultation
of
Mrs.
Martin
's
having
"
_
two
_
parlours
,
two
very
good
parlours
,
indeed
;
one
of
them
quite
as
large
as
Mrs.
Goddard
's
drawing
-
room
;
and
of
her
having
an
upper
maid
who
had
lived
five
-
and
-
twenty
years
with
her
;
and
of
their
having
eight
cows
,
two
of
them
Alderneys
,
and
one
a
little
Welch
cow
,
a
very
pretty
little
Welch
cow
indeed
;
and
of
Mrs.
Martin
's
saying
as
she
was
so
fond
of
it
,
it
should
be
called
_
her
_
cow
;
and
of
their
having
a
very
handsome
summer
-
house
in
their
garden
,
where
some
day
next
year
they
were
all
to
drink
tea
:
 
a
very
handsome
summer
-
house
,
large
enough
to
hold
a
dozen
people
.
"
  
<EOS>
For
some
time
she
was
amused
,
without
thinking
beyond
the
immediate
cause
;
but
as
she
came
to
understand
the
family
better
,
other
feelings
arose
.
<EOS>
She
had
taken
up
a
wrong
idea
,
fancying
it
was
a
mother
and
daughter
,
a
son
and
son
's
wife
,
who
all
lived
together
;
but
when
it
appeared
that
the
Mr.
Martin
,
who
bore
a
part
in
the
narrative
,
and
was
always
mentioned
with
approbation
for
his
great
good
-
nature
in
doing
something
or
other
,
was
a
single
man
;
that
there
was
no
young
Mrs.
Martin
,
no
wife
in
the
case
;
she
did
suspect
danger
to
her
poor
little
friend
from
all
this
hospitality
and
kindness
,
and
that
,
if
she
were
not
taken
care
of
,
she
might
be
required
to
sink
herself
forever
.
  
<EOS>
With
this
inspiriting
notion
,
her
questions
increased
in
number
and
meaning
;
and
she
particularly
led
Harriet
to
talk
more
of
Mr.
Martin
,
and
there
was
evidently
no
dislike
to
it
.
<EOS>
Harriet
was
very
ready
to
speak
of
the
share
he
had
had
in
their
moonlight
walks
and
merry
evening
games
;
and
dwelt
a
good
deal
upon
his
being
so
very
good
-
humoured
and
obliging
.
<EOS>
He
had
gone
three
miles
round
one
day
in
order
to
bring
her
some
walnuts
,
because
she
had
said
how
fond
she
was
of
them
,
and
in
every
thing
else
he
was
so
very
obliging
.
<EOS>
He
had
his
shepherd
's
son
into
the
parlour
one
night
on
purpose
to
sing
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
was
very
fond
of
singing
.
<EOS>
He
could
sing
a
little
himself
.
<EOS>
She
believed
he
was
very
clever
,
and
understood
every
thing
.
<EOS>
He
had
a
very
fine
flock
,
and
,
while
she
was
with
them
,
he
had
been
bid
more
for
his
wool
than
any
body
in
the
country
.
<EOS>
She
believed
every
body
spoke
well
of
him
.
<EOS>
His
mother
and
sisters
were
very
fond
of
him
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Martin
had
told
her
one
day
(
and
there
was
a
blush
as
she
said
it
,
)
<EOS>
that
it
was
impossible
for
any
body
to
be
a
better
son
,
and
therefore
she
was
sure
,
whenever
he
married
,
he
would
make
a
good
husband
.
<EOS>
Not
that
she
_
wanted
_
him
to
marry
.
<EOS>
She
was
in
no
hurry
at
all
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
done
,
Mrs.
Martin
!
"
thought
Emma
.
<EOS>
"
You
know
what
you
are
about
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
when
she
had
come
away
,
Mrs.
Martin
was
so
very
kind
as
to
send
Mrs.
Goddard
a
beautiful
goose
 
<EOS>
the
finest
goose
Mrs.
Goddard
had
ever
seen
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Goddard
had
dressed
it
on
a
Sunday
,
and
asked
all
the
three
teachers
,
Miss
Nash
,
and
Miss
Prince
,
and
Miss
Richardson
,
to
sup
with
her
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Martin
,
I
suppose
,
is
not
a
man
of
information
beyond
the
line
of
his
own
business
?
<EOS>
He
does
not
read
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
yes
!
 
<EOS>
that
is
,
no
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
 
<EOS>
but
I
believe
he
has
read
a
good
deal
 
but
not
what
you
would
think
any
thing
of
.
<EOS>
He
reads
the
Agricultural
Reports
,
and
some
other
books
that
lay
in
one
of
the
window
seats
 
<EOS>
but
he
reads
all
_
them
_
to
himself
.
<EOS>
But
sometimes
of
an
evening
,
before
we
went
to
cards
,
he
would
read
something
aloud
out
of
the
Elegant
Extracts
,
very
entertaining
.
<EOS>
And
I
know
he
has
read
the
Vicar
of
Wakefield
.
<EOS>
He
never
read
the
Romance
of
the
Forest
,
nor
The
Children
of
the
Abbey
.
<EOS>
He
had
never
heard
of
such
books
before
I
mentioned
them
,
but
he
is
determined
to
get
them
now
as
soon
as
ever
he
can
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
next
question
was
    
"
What
sort
of
looking
man
is
Mr.
Martin
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
not
handsome
 
not
at
all
handsome
.
<EOS>
I
thought
him
very
plain
at
first
,
but
I
do
not
think
him
so
plain
now
.
<EOS>
One
does
not
,
you
know
,
after
a
time
.
<EOS>
But
did
you
never
see
him
?
<EOS>
He
is
in
Highbury
every
now
and
then
,
and
he
is
sure
to
ride
through
every
week
in
his
way
to
Kingston
.
<EOS>
He
has
passed
you
very
often
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
may
be
,
and
I
may
have
seen
him
fifty
times
,
but
without
having
any
idea
of
his
name
.
<EOS>
A
young
farmer
,
whether
on
horseback
or
on
foot
,
is
the
very
last
sort
of
person
to
raise
my
curiosity
.
<EOS>
The
yeomanry
are
precisely
the
order
of
people
with
whom
I
feel
I
can
have
nothing
to
do
.
<EOS>
A
degree
or
two
lower
,
and
a
creditable
appearance
might
interest
me
;
I
might
hope
to
be
useful
to
their
families
in
some
way
or
other
.
<EOS>
But
a
farmer
can
need
none
of
my
help
,
and
is
,
therefore
,
in
one
sense
,
as
much
above
my
notice
as
in
every
other
he
is
below
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
To
be
sure
.
<EOS>
Oh
yes
!
<EOS>
It
is
not
likely
you
should
ever
have
observed
him
;
but
he
knows
you
very
well
indeed
 
<EOS>
I
mean
by
sight
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
doubt
of
his
being
a
very
respectable
young
man
.
<EOS>
I
know
,
indeed
,
that
he
is
so
,
and
,
as
such
,
wish
him
well
.
<EOS>
What
do
you
imagine
his
age
to
be
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
was
four
-
and
-
twenty
the
8th
of
last
June
,
and
my
birthday
is
the
23rd
just
a
fortnight
and
a
day
's
difference
 
which
is
very
odd
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Only
four
-
and
-
twenty
.
<EOS>
That
is
too
young
to
settle
.
<EOS>
His
mother
is
perfectly
right
not
to
be
in
a
hurry
.
<EOS>
They
seem
very
comfortable
as
they
are
,
and
if
she
were
to
take
any
pains
to
marry
him
,
she
would
probably
repent
it
.
<EOS>
Six
years
hence
,
if
he
could
meet
with
a
good
sort
of
young
woman
in
the
same
rank
as
his
own
,
with
a
little
money
,
it
might
be
very
desirable
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Six
years
hence
!
<EOS>
Dear
Miss
Woodhouse
,
he
would
be
thirty
years

Well
,
and
that
is
as
early
as
most
men
can
afford
to
marry
,
who
are
not
born
to
an
independence
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Martin
,
I
imagine
,
has
his
fortune
entirely
to
make
 
can
not
be
at
all
beforehand
with
the
world
.
<EOS>
Whatever
money
he
might
come
into
when
his
father
died
,
whatever
his
share
of
the
family
property
,
it
is
,
I
dare
say
,
all
afloat
,
all
employed
in
his
stock
,
and
so
forth
;
and
though
,
with
diligence
and
good
luck
,
he
may
be
rich
in
time
,
it
is
next
to
impossible
that
he
should
have
realised
any
thing
yet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
To
be
sure
,
so
it
is
.
<EOS>
But
they
live
very
comfortably
.
<EOS>
They
have
no
indoors
man
,
else
they
do
not
want
for
any
thing
;
and
Mrs.
Martin
talks
of
taking
a
boy
another
year
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
you
may
not
get
into
a
scrape
,
Harriet
,
whenever
he
does
marry
;
 
I
mean
,
as
to
being
acquainted
with
his
wife
 
for
though
his
sisters
,
from
a
superior
education
,
are
not
to
be
altogether
objected
to
,
it
does
not
follow
that
he
might
marry
any
body
at
all
fit
for
you
to
notice
.
<EOS>
The
misfortune
of
your
birth
ought
to
make
you
particularly
careful
as
to
your
associates
.
<EOS>
There
can
be
no
doubt
of
your
being
a
gentleman
's
daughter
,
and
you
must
support
your
claim
to
that
station
by
every
thing
within
your
own
power
,
or
there
will
be
plenty
of
people
who
would
take
pleasure
in
degrading
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
to
be
sure
,
I
suppose
there
are
.
<EOS>
But
while
I
visit
at
Hartfield
,
and
you
are
so
kind
to
me
,
Miss
Woodhouse
,
I
am
not
afraid
of
what
any
body
can
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
understand
the
force
of
influence
pretty
well
,
Harriet
;
but
I
would
have
you
so
firmly
established
in
good
society
,
as
to
be
independent
even
of
Hartfield
and
Miss
Woodhouse
.
<EOS>
I
want
to
see
you
permanently
well
connected
,
and
to
that
end
it
will
be
advisable
to
have
as
few
odd
acquaintance
as
may
be
;
and
,
therefore
,
I
say
that
if
you
should
still
be
in
this
country
when
Mr.
Martin
marries
,
I
wish
you
may
not
be
drawn
in
by
your
intimacy
with
the
sisters
,
to
be
acquainted
with
the
wife
,
who
will
probably
be
some
mere
farmer
's
daughter
,
without
education
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
To
be
sure
.
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
Not
that
I
think
Mr.
Martin
would
ever
marry
any
body
<EOS>
but
what
had
had
some
education
 
and
been
very
well
brought
up
.
<EOS>
However
,
I
do
not
mean
to
set
up
my
opinion
against
yours
 
<EOS>
and
I
am
sure
I
shall
not
wish
for
the
acquaintance
of
his
wife
.
<EOS>
I
shall
always
have
a
great
regard
for
the
Miss
Martins
,
especially
Elizabeth
,
and
should
be
very
sorry
to
give
them
up
,
for
they
are
quite
as
well
educated
as
me
.
<EOS>
But
if
he
marries
a
very
ignorant
,
vulgar
woman
,
certainly
I
had
better
not
visit
her
,
if
I
can
help
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
watched
her
through
the
fluctuations
of
this
speech
,
and
saw
no
alarming
symptoms
of
love
.
<EOS>
The
young
man
had
been
the
first
admirer
,
but
she
trusted
there
was
no
other
hold
,
and
that
there
would
be
no
serious
difficulty
,
on
Harriet
's
side
,
to
oppose
any
friendly
arrangement
of
her
own
.
  
<EOS>
They
met
Mr.
Martin
the
very
next
day
,
as
they
were
walking
on
the
Donwell
road
.
<EOS>
He
was
on
foot
,
and
after
looking
very
respectfully
at
her
,
looked
with
most
unfeigned
satisfaction
at
her
companion
.
<EOS>
Emma
was
not
sorry
to
have
such
an
opportunity
of
survey
;
and
walking
a
few
yards
forward
,
while
they
talked
together
,
soon
made
her
quick
eye
sufficiently
acquainted
with
Mr.
Robert
Martin
.
<EOS>
His
appearance
was
very
neat
,
and
he
looked
like
a
sensible
young
man
,
but
his
person
had
no
other
advantage
;
and
when
he
came
to
be
contrasted
with
gentlemen
,
she
thought
he
must
lose
all
the
ground
he
had
gained
in
Harriet
's
inclination
.
<EOS>
Harriet
was
not
insensible
of
manner
;
she
had
voluntarily
noticed
her
father
's
gentleness
with
admiration
as
well
as
wonder
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Martin
looked
as
if
he
did
not
know
what
manner
was
.
  
<EOS>
They
remained
but
a
few
minutes
together
,
as
Miss
Woodhouse
must
not
be
kept
waiting
;
and
Harriet
then
came
running
to
her
with
a
smiling
face
,
and
in
a
flutter
of
spirits
,
which
Miss
Woodhouse
hoped
very
soon
to
compose
.
  
<EOS>
"
Only
think
of
our
happening
to
meet
him
!
 
<EOS>
How
very
odd
!
<EOS>
It
was
quite
a
chance
,
he
said
,
that
he
had
not
gone
round
by
Randalls
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
think
we
ever
walked
this
road
.
<EOS>
He
thought
we
walked
towards
Randalls
most
days
.
<EOS>
He
has
not
been
able
to
get
the
Romance
of
the
Forest
yet
.
<EOS>
He
was
so
busy
the
last
time
he
was
at
Kingston
that
he
quite
forgot
it
,
but
he
goes
again
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
So
very
odd
we
should
happen
to
meet
!
<EOS>
Well
,
Miss
Woodhouse
,
is
he
like
what
you
expected
?
<EOS>
What
do
you
think
of
him
?
<EOS>
Do
you
think
him
so
very
plain
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
very
plain
,
undoubtedly
 
remarkably
plain
:
 
but
that
is
nothing
compared
with
his
entire
want
of
gentility
.
<EOS>
I
had
no
right
to
expect
much
,
and
I
did
not
expect
much
;
but
I
had
no
idea
that
he
could
be
so
very
clownish
,
so
totally
without
air
.
<EOS>
I
had
imagined
him
,
I
confess
,
a
degree
or
two
nearer
gentility
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
To
be
sure
,
"
said
Harriet
,
in
a
mortified
voice
,
"
he
is
not
so
genteel
as
real
gentlemen
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
Harriet
,
since
your
acquaintance
with
us
,
you
have
been
repeatedly
in
the
company
of
some
such
very
real
gentlemen
,
that
you
must
yourself
be
struck
with
the
difference
in
Mr.
Martin
.
<EOS>
At
Hartfield
,
you
have
had
very
good
specimens
of
well
educated
,
well
bred
men
.
<EOS>
I
should
be
surprized
if
,
after
seeing
them
,
you
could
be
in
company
with
Mr.
Martin
again
without
perceiving
him
to
be
a
very
inferior
creature
 
and
rather
wondering
at
yourself
for
having
ever
thought
him
at
all
agreeable
before
.
<EOS>
Do
not
you
begin
to
feel
that
now
?
<EOS>
Were
not
you
struck
?
<EOS>
I
am
sure
you
must
have
been
struck
by
his
awkward
look
and
abrupt
manner
,
and
the
uncouthness
of
a
voice
which
I
heard
to
be
wholly
unmodulated
as
I
stood
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Certainly
,
he
is
not
like
Mr.
Knightley
.
<EOS>
He
has
not
such
a
fine
air
and
way
of
walking
as
Mr.
Knightley
.
<EOS>
I
see
the
difference
plain
enough
.
<EOS>
But
Mr.
Knightley
is
so
very
fine
a
man
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Knightley
's
air
is
so
remarkably
good
that
it
is
not
fair
to
compare
Mr.
Martin
with
_
him
<EOS>
_
.
<EOS>
You
might
not
see
one
in
a
hundred
with
_
gentleman
_
so
plainly
written
as
in
Mr.
Knightley
.
<EOS>
But
he
is
not
the
only
gentleman
you
have
been
lately
used
to
.
<EOS>
What
say
you
to
Mr.
Weston
and
Mr.
Elton
?
<EOS>
Compare
Mr.
Martin
with
either
of
_
them
_
.
<EOS>
Compare
their
manner
of
carrying
themselves
;
of
walking
;
of
speaking
;
of
being
silent
.
<EOS>
You
must
see
the
difference
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
yes
!
 
<EOS>
there
is
a
great
difference
.
<EOS>
But
Mr.
Weston
is
almost
an
old
man
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Weston
must
be
between
forty
and
fifty
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
Which
makes
his
good
manners
the
more
valuable
.
<EOS>
The
older
a
person
grows
,
Harriet
,
the
more
important
it
is
that
their
manners
should
not
be
bad
;
the
more
glaring
and
disgusting
any
loudness
,
or
coarseness
,
or
awkwardness
becomes
.
<EOS>
What
is
passable
in
youth
is
detestable
in
later
age
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Martin
is
now
awkward
and
abrupt
;
what
will
he
be
at
Mr.
Weston
's
time
of
life
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
no
saying
,
indeed
,
"
replied
Harriet
rather
solemnly
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
there
may
be
pretty
good
guessing
.
<EOS>
He
will
be
a
completely
gross
,
vulgar
farmer
,
totally
inattentive
to
appearances
,
and
thinking
of
nothing
but
profit
and
loss
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Will
he
,
indeed
?
<EOS>
That
will
be
very
bad
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
much
his
business
engrosses
him
already
is
very
plain
from
the
circumstance
of
his
forgetting
to
inquire
for
the
book
you
recommended
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
great
deal
too
full
of
the
market
to
think
of
any
thing
else
 
which
is
just
as
it
should
be
,
for
a
thriving
man
.
<EOS>
What
has
he
to
do
with
books
?
<EOS>
And
I
have
no
doubt
that
he
_
will
_
thrive
,
and
be
a
very
rich
man
in
time
 
and
his
being
illiterate
and
coarse
need
not
disturb
_
us
_
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
he
did
not
remember
the
book
"
 
was
all
Harriet
's
answer
,
and
spoken
with
a
degree
of
grave
displeasure
which
Emma
thought
might
be
safely
left
to
itself
.
<EOS>
She
,
therefore
,
said
no
more
for
some
time
.
<EOS>
Her
next
beginning
was
,
  
"
<EOS>
In
one
respect
,
perhaps
,
Mr.
Elton
's
manners
are
superior
to
Mr.
Knightley
's
or
Mr.
Weston
's
.
<EOS>
They
have
more
gentleness
.
<EOS>
They
might
be
more
safely
held
up
as
a
pattern
.
<EOS>
There
is
an
openness
,
a
quickness
,
almost
a
bluntness
in
Mr.
Weston
,
which
every
body
likes
in
_
him
<EOS>
_
,
because
there
is
so
much
good
-
humour
with
it
 
but
that
would
not
do
to
be
copied
.
<EOS>
Neither
would
Mr.
Knightley
's
downright
,
decided
,
commanding
sort
of
manner
,
though
it
suits
_
him
_
very
well
;
his
figure
,
and
look
,
and
situation
in
life
seem
to
allow
it
;
but
if
any
young
man
were
to
set
about
copying
him
,
he
would
not
be
sufferable
.
<EOS>
On
the
contrary
,
I
think
a
young
man
might
be
very
safely
recommended
to
take
Mr.
Elton
as
a
model
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Elton
is
good
-
humoured
,
cheerful
,
obliging
,
and
gentle
.
<EOS>
He
seems
to
me
to
be
grown
particularly
gentle
of
late
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
whether
he
has
any
design
of
ingratiating
himself
with
either
of
us
,
Harriet
,
by
additional
softness
,
but
it
strikes
me
that
his
manners
are
softer
than
they
used
to
be
.
<EOS>
If
he
means
any
thing
,
it
must
be
to
please
you
.
<EOS>
Did
not
I
tell
you
what
he
said
of
you
the
other
day
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
then
repeated
some
warm
personal
praise
which
she
had
drawn
from
Mr.
Elton
,
and
now
did
full
justice
to
;
and
Harriet
blushed
and
smiled
,
and
said
she
had
always
thought
Mr.
Elton
very
agreeable
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Elton
was
the
very
person
fixed
on
by
Emma
for
driving
the
young
farmer
out
of
Harriet
's
head
.
<EOS>
She
thought
it
would
be
an
excellent
match
;
and
only
too
palpably
desirable
,
natural
,
and
probable
,
for
her
to
have
much
merit
in
planning
it
.
<EOS>
She
feared
it
was
what
every
body
else
must
think
of
and
predict
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
likely
,
however
,
that
any
body
should
have
equalled
her
in
the
date
of
the
plan
,
as
it
had
entered
her
brain
during
the
very
first
evening
of
Harriet
's
coming
to
Hartfield
.
<EOS>
The
longer
she
considered
it
,
the
greater
was
her
sense
of
its
expediency
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Elton
's
situation
was
most
suitable
,
quite
the
gentleman
himself
,
and
without
low
connexions
;
at
the
same
time
,
not
of
any
family
that
could
fairly
object
to
the
doubtful
birth
of
Harriet
.
<EOS>
He
had
a
comfortable
home
for
her
,
and
Emma
imagined
a
very
sufficient
income
;
for
though
the
vicarage
of
Highbury
was
not
large
,
he
was
known
to
have
some
independent
property
;
and
she
thought
very
highly
of
him
as
a
good
-
humoured
,
well
-
meaning
,
respectable
young
man
,
without
any
deficiency
of
useful
understanding
or
knowledge
of
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
She
had
already
satisfied
herself
that
he
thought
Harriet
a
beautiful
girl
,
which
she
trusted
,
with
such
frequent
meetings
at
Hartfield
,
was
foundation
enough
on
his
side
;
and
on
Harriet
's
there
could
be
little
doubt
that
the
idea
of
being
preferred
by
him
would
have
all
the
usual
weight
and
efficacy
.
<EOS>
And
he
was
really
a
very
pleasing
young
man
,
a
young
man
whom
any
woman
not
fastidious
might
like
.
<EOS>
He
was
reckoned
very
handsome
;
his
person
much
admired
in
general
,
though
not
by
her
,
there
being
a
want
of
elegance
of
feature
which
she
could
not
dispense
with
:
 
<EOS>
but
the
girl
who
could
be
gratified
by
a
Robert
Martin
's
riding
about
the
country
to
get
walnuts
for
her
might
very
well
be
conquered
by
Mr.
Elton
's
admiration
.
    
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
what
your
opinion
may
be
,
Mrs.
Weston
,
"
said
Mr.
Knightley
,
"
of
this
great
intimacy
between
Emma
and
Harriet
Smith
,
but
I
think
it
a
bad
thing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
bad
thing
!
<EOS>
Do
you
really
think
it
a
bad
thing
?
 
<EOS>
why
so
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
they
will
neither
of
them
do
the
other
any
good
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
surprize
me
!
<EOS>
Emma
must
do
Harriet
good
:
and
by
supplying
her
with
a
new
object
of
interest
,
Harriet
may
be
said
to
do
Emma
good
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
seeing
their
intimacy
with
the
greatest
pleasure
.
<EOS>
How
very
differently
we
feel
!
 
<EOS>
Not
think
they
will
do
each
other
any
good
!
<EOS>
This
will
certainly
be
the
beginning
of
one
of
our
quarrels
about
Emma
,
Mr.
Knightley
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
you
think
I
am
come
on
purpose
to
quarrel
with
you
,
knowing
Weston
to
be
out
,
and
that
you
must
still
fight
your
own
battle
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Weston
would
undoubtedly
support
me
,
if
he
were
here
,
for
he
thinks
exactly
as
I
do
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
We
were
speaking
of
it
only
yesterday
,
and
agreeing
how
fortunate
it
was
for
Emma
,
that
there
should
be
such
a
girl
in
Highbury
for
her
to
associate
with
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Knightley
,
I
shall
not
allow
you
to
be
a
fair
judge
in
this
case
.
<EOS>
You
are
so
much
used
to
live
alone
,
that
you
do
not
know
the
value
of
a
companion
;
and
,
perhaps
no
man
can
be
a
good
judge
of
the
comfort
a
woman
feels
in
the
society
of
one
of
her
own
sex
,
after
being
used
to
it
all
her
life
.
<EOS>
I
can
imagine
your
objection
to
Harriet
Smith
.
<EOS>
She
is
not
the
superior
young
woman
which
Emma
's
friend
ought
to
be
.
<EOS>
But
on
the
other
hand
,
as
Emma
wants
to
see
her
better
informed
,
it
will
be
an
inducement
to
her
to
read
more
herself
.
<EOS>
They
will
read
together
.
<EOS>
She
means
it
,
I
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Emma
has
been
meaning
to
read
more
ever
since
she
was
twelve
years
old
.
<EOS>
I
have
seen
a
great
many
lists
of
her
drawing
-
up
at
various
times
of
books
that
she
meant
to
read
regularly
through
 
and
<EOS>
very
good
lists
<EOS>
they
were
 
very
well
chosen
,
and
very
neatly
arranged
 
sometimes
alphabetically
,
and
sometimes
by
some
other
rule
.
<EOS>
The
list
she
drew
up
when
only
fourteen
 
<EOS>
I
remember
thinking
it
did
her
judgment
<EOS>
so
much
credit
<EOS>
,
that
I
preserved
it
some
time
;
and
I
dare
say
she
may
have
made
out
a
very
good
list
now
.
<EOS>
But
I
have
done
with
expecting
any
course
of
steady
reading
from
Emma
.
<EOS>
She
will
never
submit
to
any
thing
requiring
industry
and
patience
,
and
a
subjection
of
the
fancy
to
the
understanding
.
<EOS>
Where
Miss
Taylor
failed
to
stimulate
,
I
may
safely
affirm
that
Harriet
Smith
will
do
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
You
never
could
persuade
her
to
read
half
so
much
as
you
wished
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
you
could
not
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
dare
say
,
"
replied
Mrs.
Weston
,
smiling
,
"
that
I
thought
<EOS>
so
_
then
_
;
 
<EOS>
but
since
we
have
parted
,
I
can
never
remember
Emma
's
omitting
to
do
any
thing
I
wished
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
hardly
any
desiring
to
refresh
such
a
memory
as
_
that
_
,
"
 
said
Mr.
Knightley
,
feelingly
;
and
for
a
moment
or
two
he
had
done
.
"
<EOS>
But
I
,
"
he
soon
added
,
"
who
have
had
no
such
charm
thrown
over
my
senses
,
must
still
see
,
hear
,
and
remember
.
<EOS>
Emma
is
spoiled
by
being
the
cleverest
of
her
family
.
<EOS>
At
ten
years
old
,
she
had
the
misfortune
of
being
able
to
answer
questions
which
puzzled
her
sister
at
seventeen
.
<EOS>
She
was
always
quick
and
assured
:
Isabella
slow
and
diffident
.
<EOS>
And
ever
since
she
was
twelve
,
Emma
has
been
mistress
of
the
house
and
of
you
all
.
<EOS>
In
her
mother
she
lost
the
only
person
able
to
cope
with
her
.
<EOS>
She
inherits
her
mother
's
talents
,
and
must
have
been
under
subjection
to
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
have
been
sorry
,
Mr.
Knightley
,
to
be
dependent
on
_
your
_
recommendation
,
had
I
quitted
Mr.
Woodhouse
's
family
and
wanted
another
situation
;
I
do
not
think
you
would
have
spoken
a
good
word
for
me
to
any
body
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
you
always
thought
me
unfit
for
the
office
I
held
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
he
,
smiling
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
better
placed
_
here
_
;
very
fit
for
a
wife
,
but
not
at
all
for
a
governess
.
<EOS>
But
you
were
preparing
yourself
to
be
an
excellent
wife
all
the
time
you
were
at
Hartfield
.
<EOS>
You
might
not
give
Emma
such
a
complete
education
as
your
powers
would
seem
to
promise
;
but
you
were
receiving
a
very
good
education
from
_
her
_
,
on
the
very
material
matrimonial
point
of
submitting
your
own
will
,
and
doing
as
you
were
bid
;
and
if
Weston
had
asked
me
to
recommend
him
a
wife
,
I
should
certainly
have
named
Miss
Taylor
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
.
<EOS>
There
will
be
very
little
merit
in
making
a
good
wife
to
such
a
man
as
Mr.
Weston
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
to
own
the
truth
,
I
am
afraid
you
are
rather
thrown
away
,
and
that
with
every
disposition
to
bear
,
there
will
be
nothing
to
be
borne
.
<EOS>
We
will
not
despair
,
however
.
<EOS>
Weston
may
grow
cross
from
the
wantonness
of
comfort
,
or
his
son
may
plague
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
not
_
<EOS>
that
_
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
not
likely
.
<EOS>
No
,
Mr.
Knightley
,
do
not
foretell
vexation
from
that
quarter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
I
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
I
only
name
possibilities
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
pretend
to
Emma
's
genius
for
foretelling
and
guessing
.
<EOS>
I
hope
,
with
all
my
heart
,
the
young
man
may
be
a
Weston
in
merit
,
and
a
Churchill
in
fortune
.
 
<EOS>
But
Harriet
Smith
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
half
done
about
Harriet
Smith
.
<EOS>
I
think
her
the
very
worst
sort
of
companion
that
Emma
could
possibly
have
.
<EOS>
She
knows
nothing
herself
,
and
looks
upon
Emma
as
knowing
every
thing
.
<EOS>
She
is
a
flatterer
in
all
her
ways
;
and
so
much
the
worse
,
because
undesigned
.
<EOS>
Her
ignorance
is
hourly
flattery
.
<EOS>
How
can
Emma
imagine
she
has
any
thing
to
learn
herself
,
while
Harriet
is
presenting
such
a
delightful
inferiority
?
<EOS>
And
as
for
Harriet
,
I
will
venture
to
say
that
_
she
_
can
not
gain
by
the
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
Hartfield
will
only
put
her
out
of
conceit
with
all
the
other
places
she
belongs
to
.
<EOS>
She
will
grow
just
refined
enough
to
be
uncomfortable
with
those
among
whom
birth
and
circumstances
have
placed
her
home
.
<EOS>
I
am
much
mistaken
if
Emma
's
doctrines
give
any
strength
of
mind
,
or
tend
at
all
to
make
a
girl
adapt
herself
rationally
to
the
varieties
of
her
situation
in
life
.
 
<EOS>
They
only
give
a
little
polish
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
either
depend
more
upon
Emma
's
good
sense
than
you
do
,
or
am
more
anxious
for
her
present
comfort
;
for
I
can
not
lament
the
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
How
well
she
looked
last
night
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
you
would
rather
talk
of
her
person
than
her
mind
,
would
you
?
<EOS>
Very
well
;
I
shall
not
attempt
to
deny
Emma
's
being
pretty
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Pretty
!
say
beautiful
rather
.
<EOS>
Can
you
imagine
any
thing
nearer
perfect
beauty
than
Emma
altogether
 
face
and
figure
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
what
I
could
imagine
,
but
I
confess
that
I
have
seldom
seen
a
face
or
figure
more
pleasing
to
me
than
hers
.
<EOS>
But
I
am
a
partial
old
friend
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Such
an
eye
!
 
<EOS>
the
true
hazle
eye
 
and
so
brilliant
!
<EOS>
regular
features
,
open
countenance
,
with
a
complexion
!
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
what
a
bloom
of
full
health
,
and
such
a
pretty
height
and
size
;
such
a
firm
and
upright
figure
!
<EOS>
There
is
health
,
not
merely
in
her
bloom
,
but
in
her
air
,
her
head
,
her
glance
.
<EOS>
One
hears
sometimes
of
a
child
being
"
the
picture
of
health
;
"
now
,
Emma
always
gives
me
the
idea
of
being
the
complete
picture
of
grown
-
up
health
.
<EOS>
She
is
loveliness
itself
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Knightley
,
is
not
she
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
a
fault
to
find
with
her
person
,
"
he
replied
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
her
all
you
describe
.
<EOS>
I
love
to
look
at
her
;
and
I
will
add
this
praise
,
that
I
do
not
think
her
personally
vain
.
<EOS>
Considering
how
very
handsome
she
is
,
she
appears
to
be
little
occupied
with
it
;
her
vanity
lies
another
way
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Weston
,
I
am
not
to
be
talked
out
of
my
dislike
of
Harriet
Smith
,
or
my
dread
of
its
doing
them
both
harm
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
I
,
Mr.
Knightley
,
am
equally
stout
in
my
confidence
of
its
not
doing
them
any
harm
.
<EOS>
With
all
dear
Emma
's
little
faults
,
she
is
an
excellent
creature
.
<EOS>
Where
shall
we
see
a
better
daughter
,
or
a
kinder
sister
,
or
a
truer
friend
?
<EOS>
No
,
no
;
she
has
qualities
which
may
be
trusted
;
she
will
never
lead
any
one
really
wrong
;
she
will
make
no
lasting
blunder
;
where
Emma
errs
<EOS>
once
,
she
is
in
the
right
a
hundred
times
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
well
;
I
will
not
plague
you
any
more
.
<EOS>
Emma
shall
be
an
angel
,
and
I
will
keep
my
spleen
to
myself
till
Christmas
brings
John
and
Isabella
.
<EOS>
John
loves
Emma
with
a
reasonable
and
therefore
not
a
blind
affection
,
and
Isabella
always
thinks
as
he
does
;
except
when
he
is
not
quite
frightened
enough
about
the
children
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
of
having
their
opinions
with
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
that
you
all
love
her
really
too
well
to
be
unjust
or
unkind
;
but
excuse
me
,
Mr.
Knightley
,
if
I
take
the
liberty
(
I
consider
myself
,
you
know
,
as
having
somewhat
of
the
privilege
of
speech
that
Emma
's
mother
might
have
had
)
the
liberty
of
hinting
that
I
do
not
think
any
possible
good
can
arise
from
Harriet
Smith
's
intimacy
being
made
a
matter
of
much
discussion
among
you
.
<EOS>
Pray
excuse
me
;
but
supposing
any
little
inconvenience
may
be
apprehended
from
the
intimacy
<EOS>
,
it
can
not
be
expected
that
Emma
,
accountable
to
nobody
but
her
father
,
who
perfectly
approves
the
acquaintance
,
should
put
an
end
to
it
,
so
long
as
it
is
a
source
of
pleasure
to
herself
.
<EOS>
It
has
been
so
many
years
my
province
to
give
advice
,
that
you
can
not
be
surprized
,
Mr.
Knightley
,
at
this
little
remains
of
office
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Not
at
all
,
"
cried
he
;
"
I
am
much
obliged
to
you
for
it
.
<EOS>
It
is
very
good
advice
,
and
it
shall
have
a
better
fate
than
your
advice
has
often
found
;
for
it
shall
be
attended
to
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Mrs.
John
Knightley
is
easily
alarmed
,
and
might
be
made
unhappy
about
her
sister
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Be
satisfied
,
"
said
he
,
"
I
will
not
raise
any
outcry
.
<EOS>
I
will
keep
my
ill
-
humour
to
myself
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
very
sincere
interest
in
Emma
.
<EOS>
Isabella
does
not
seem
more
my
sister
;
has
never
excited
a
greater
interest
;
perhaps
hardly
so
great
.
<EOS>
There
is
an
anxiety
,
a
curiosity
in
what
one
feels
for
Emma
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
what
will
become
of
her
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
So
do
I
,
"
said
Mrs.
Weston
gently
,
"
very
much
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
always
declares
she
will
never
marry
,
which
,
of
course
,
means
just
nothing
at
all
.
<EOS>
But
I
have
no
idea
that
she
has
yet
ever
seen
a
man
she
cared
for
.
<EOS>
It
would
not
be
a
bad
thing
for
her
to
be
very
much
in
love
with
a
proper
object
.
<EOS>
I
should
like
to
see
Emma
in
love
,
and
in
some
doubt
of
a
return
;
it
would
do
her
good
.
<EOS>
But
there
is
nobody
hereabouts
to
attach
her
;
and
she
goes
so
seldom
from
home
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
does
,
indeed
,
seem
as
little
to
tempt
her
to
break
her
resolution
at
present
,
"
said
Mrs.
Weston
,
"
as
can
well
be
;
and
while
she
is
so
happy
at
Hartfield
,
I
can
not
wish
her
to
be
forming
any
attachment
which
would
be
creating
such
difficulties
on
poor
Mr.
Woodhouse
's
account
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
recommend
matrimony
at
present
to
Emma
,
though
I
mean
no
slight
to
the
state
,
I
assure
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Part
of
her
meaning
was
to
conceal
some
favourite
thoughts
of
her
own
and
Mr.
Weston
's
on
the
subject
,
as
much
as
possible
.
<EOS>
There
were
wishes
at
Randalls
respecting
Emma
's
destiny
,
but
it
was
not
desirable
to
have
them
suspected
;
and
the
quiet
transition
which
Mr.
Knightley
soon
afterwards
made
to
"
What
does
Weston
think
of
the
weather
;
shall
we
have
rain
?
"
convinced
her
that
he
had
nothing
more
to
say
or
surmise
about
Hartfield
.
    
<EOS>
Emma
could
not
feel
a
doubt
of
having
given
Harriet
's
fancy
a
proper
direction
and
raised
the
gratitude
of
her
young
vanity
to
a
very
good
purpose
,
for
she
found
her
decidedly
more
sensible
than
before
of
Mr.
Elton
's
being
a
remarkably
handsome
man
,
with
most
agreeable
manners
;
and
as
she
had
no
hesitation
in
following
up
the
assurance
of
his
admiration
by
agreeable
hints
,
she
was
soon
pretty
confident
of
creating
as
much
liking
on
Harriet
's
side
,
as
there
could
be
any
occasion
for
.
<EOS>
She
was
quite
convinced
of
Mr.
Elton
's
being
in
the
fairest
way
of
falling
in
love
,
if
not
in
love
already
.
<EOS>
She
had
no
scruple
with
regard
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
talked
of
Harriet
,
and
praised
her
so
warmly
,
that
she
could
not
suppose
any
thing
wanting
which
a
little
time
would
not
add
.
<EOS>
His
perception
of
the
striking
improvement
of
Harriet
's
manner
,
since
her
introduction
at
Hartfield
,
was
not
one
of
the
least
agreeable
proofs
of
his
growing
attachment
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
given
Miss
Smith
all
that
she
required
,
"
said
he
;
"
you
have
made
her
graceful
and
easy
.
<EOS>
She
was
a
beautiful
creature
when
she
came
to
you
,
but
,
in
my
opinion
,
the
attractions
you
have
added
are
infinitely
superior
to
what
she
received
from
nature
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
you
think
I
have
been
useful
to
her
;
but
Harriet
only
wanted
drawing
out
,
and
receiving
a
few
,
very
few
hints
.
<EOS>
She
had
all
the
natural
grace
of
sweetness
of
temper
and
artlessness
in
herself
.
<EOS>
I
have
done
very
little
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
it
were
admissible
to
contradict
a
lady
,
"
said
the
gallant
Mr.
Elton
    
<EOS>
"
I
have
perhaps
given
her
a
little
more
decision
of
character
,
have
taught
her
to
think
on
points
which
had
not
fallen
in
her
way
before
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Exactly
so
;
that
is
what
principally
strikes
me
.
<EOS>
So
much
superadded
decision
of
character
!
<EOS>
Skilful
has
been
the
hand
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Great
has
been
the
pleasure
,
I
am
sure
.
<EOS>
I
never
met
with
a
disposition
more
truly
amiable
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
doubt
of
it
.
"
<EOS>
And
it
was
spoken
with
a
sort
of
sighing
animation
,
which
had
a
vast
deal
of
the
lover
.
<EOS>
She
was
not
less
pleased
another
day
with
the
manner
in
which
he
seconded
a
sudden
wish
of
hers
,
to
have
Harriet
's
picture
.
  
<EOS>
"
Did
you
ever
have
your
likeness
taken
,
Harriet
?
"
said
she
:
"
did
you
ever
sit
for
your
picture
?
"
  
<EOS>
Harriet
was
on
the
point
of
leaving
the
room
,
and
only
stopt
to
say
,
with
a
very
interesting
naivete
,
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
dear
,
no
,
never
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
No
sooner
was
she
out
of
sight
,
than
Emma
exclaimed
,
  
<EOS>
"
What
an
exquisite
possession
a
good
picture
of
her
would
be
!
<EOS>
I
would
give
any
money
for
it
.
<EOS>
I
almost
long
to
attempt
her
likeness
myself
.
<EOS>
You
do
not
know
it
<EOS>
I
dare
say
,
but
two
or
three
years
ago
I
had
a
great
passion
for
taking
likenesses
,
and
attempted
several
of
my
friends
,
and
was
thought
to
have
a
tolerable
eye
in
general
.
<EOS>
But
from
one
cause
or
another
,
I
gave
it
up
in
disgust
.
<EOS>
But
really
,
I
could
almost
venture
,
if
Harriet
would
sit
to
me
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
such
a
delight
to
have
her
picture
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Let
me
entreat
you
,
"
cried
Mr.
Elton
;
"
it
would
indeed
be
a
delight
!
<EOS>
Let
me
entreat
you
,
Miss
Woodhouse
,
to
exercise
so
charming
a
talent
in
favour
of
your
friend
.
<EOS>
I
know
what
your
drawings
are
.
<EOS>
How
could
you
suppose
me
ignorant
?
<EOS>
Is
not
this
room
rich
in
specimens
of
your
landscapes
and
flowers
;
and
has
not
Mrs.
Weston
<EOS>
some
inimitable
figure
-
pieces
in
her
drawing
-
room
,
at
Randalls
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Yes
,
good
man
!
 
<EOS>
thought
Emma
 
<EOS>
but
what
has
all
that
to
do
with
taking
likenesses
?
<EOS>
You
know
nothing
of
drawing
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
pretend
to
be
in
raptures
about
mine
.
<EOS>
Keep
your
raptures
for
Harriet
's
face
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
if
you
give
me
such
kind
encouragement
,
Mr.
Elton
,
I
believe
I
shall
try
what
I
can
do
.
<EOS>
Harriet
's
features
are
very
delicate
,
which
makes
a
likeness
difficult
;
and
yet
there
is
a
peculiarity
in
the
shape
of
the
eye
and
the
lines
about
the
mouth
which
one
ought
to
catch
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Exactly
so
 
The
shape
of
the
eye
and
the
lines
about
the
mouth
 
I
have
not
a
doubt
of
your
success
.
<EOS>
Pray
,
pray
attempt
it
.
<EOS>
As
you
will
do
it
,
it
will
indeed
,
to
use
your
own
words
,
be
an
exquisite
possession
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
am
afraid
,
Mr.
Elton
,
Harriet
will
not
like
to
sit
.
<EOS>
She
thinks
so
little
of
her
own
beauty
.
<EOS>
Did
not
you
observe
her
manner
of
answering
me
?
<EOS>
How
completely
it
meant
,
"
why
should
my
picture
be
drawn
?
"
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
yes
,
I
observed
it
,
I
assure
you
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
lost
on
me
.
<EOS>
But
still
I
can
not
imagine
she
would
not
be
persuaded
.
"
  
<EOS>
Harriet
was
soon
back
again
,
and
the
proposal
almost
immediately
made
;
and
she
had
no
scruples
which
could
stand
many
minutes
against
the
earnest
pressing
of
both
the
others
.
<EOS>
Emma
wished
to
go
to
work
directly
,
and
therefore
produced
the
portfolio
containing
her
various
attempts
at
portraits
,
for
not
one
of
them
had
ever
been
finished
,
that
they
might
decide
together
on
the
best
size
for
Harriet
.
<EOS>
Her
many
beginnings
were
displayed
.
<EOS>
Miniatures
,
half
-
lengths
,
whole
-
lengths
,
pencil
,
crayon
,
and
water
-
colours
had
been
all
tried
in
turn
.
<EOS>
She
had
always
wanted
to
do
every
thing
,
and
had
made
more
progress
both
in
drawing
and
music
than
many
might
have
done
with
so
little
labour
as
she
would
ever
submit
to
.
<EOS>
She
played
and
sang
;
 
and
drew
in
almost
every
style
;
but
steadiness
had
always
been
wanting
;
and
in
nothing
had
she
approached
the
degree
of
excellence
which
she
would
have
been
glad
to
command
,
and
ought
not
to
have
failed
of
.
<EOS>
She
was
not
much
deceived
as
to
her
own
skill
either
as
an
artist
or
a
musician
,
but
she
was
not
unwilling
to
have
others
deceived
,
or
sorry
to
know
her
reputation
for
accomplishment
often
higher
than
it
deserved
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
merit
in
every
drawing
 
in
the
least
finished
,
perhaps
the
most
;
her
style
was
spirited
;
but
had
there
been
much
less
,
or
had
there
been
ten
times
more
,
<EOS>
the
delight
and
admiration
of
her
two
companions
would
have
been
the
same
.
<EOS>
They
were
both
in
ecstasies
.
<EOS>
A
likeness
pleases
every
body
;
and
Miss
Woodhouse
's
performances
must
be
capital
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
great
variety
of
faces
for
you
,
"
said
Emma
.
<EOS>
"
I
had
only
my
own
family
to
study
from
.
<EOS>
There
is
my
father
 
another
of
my
father
 
but
the
idea
of
sitting
for
his
picture
made
him
so
nervous
,
that
I
could
only
take
him
by
stealth
;
neither
of
them
very
like
therefore
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Weston
again
,
and
again
,
and
again
,
you
see
.
<EOS>
Dear
Mrs.
Weston
!
<EOS>
always
my
kindest
friend
on
every
occasion
.
<EOS>
She
would
sit
whenever
I
asked
her
.
<EOS>
There
is
my
sister
;
and
really
quite
her
own
little
elegant
figure
!
 
<EOS>
and
the
face
not
unlike
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
made
a
good
likeness
of
her
,
if
she
would
have
sat
longer
,
but
she
was
in
such
a
hurry
to
have
me
draw
her
four
children
that
she
would
not
be
quiet
.
<EOS>
Then
,
here
come
all
my
attempts
at
three
of
those
four
children
;
 
there
they
are
,
Henry
and
John
and
Bella
,
from
one
end
of
the
sheet
to
the
other
,
and
any
one
of
them
might
do
for
any
one
of
the
rest
.
<EOS>
She
was
so
eager
to
have
them
drawn
that
I
could
not
refuse
;
but
there
is
no
making
children
of
three
or
four
years
old
stand
still
you
know
;
nor
can
it
be
very
easy
to
take
any
likeness
of
them
,
beyond
the
air
and
complexion
,
unless
they
are
coarser
featured
than
any
of
mama
's
children
ever
were
.
<EOS>
Here
is
my
sketch
of
the
fourth
,
who
was
a
baby
.
<EOS>
I
took
him
as
he
was
sleeping
on
the
sofa
,
and
it
is
as
strong
a
likeness
of
his
cockade
as
you
would
wish
to
see
.
<EOS>
He
had
nestled
down
his
head
most
conveniently
.
<EOS>
That
's
very
like
.
<EOS>
I
am
rather
proud
of
little
George
.
<EOS>
The
corner
of
the
sofa
is
very
good
.
<EOS>
Then
here
is
my
last
,
"
 
unclosing
a
pretty
sketch
of
a
gentleman
in
small
size
,
whole
-
length
 
"
my
last
and
my
best
 
<EOS>
my
brother
,
Mr.
John
Knightley
.
 
<EOS>
This
did
not
want
much
of
being
finished
,
when
I
put
it
away
in
a
pet
,
and
vowed
I
would
never
take
another
likeness
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
help
being
provoked
;
for
after
all
my
pains
,
and
when
I
had
really
made
a
very
good
likeness
of
it
 
<EOS>
(
Mrs.
Weston
and
I
were
quite
agreed
in
thinking
it
_
very
_
like
)
 
<EOS>
only
too
handsome
 
too
flattering
 
<EOS>
but
that
was
a
fault
on
the
right
side
<EOS>
"
 
after
all
this
,
came
poor
dear
Isabella
's
cold
approbation
of
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
it
was
a
little
like
 
but
to
be
sure
it
did
not
do
him
justice
.
<EOS>
We
had
had
a
great
deal
of
trouble
in
persuading
him
to
sit
at
all
.
<EOS>
It
was
made
a
great
favour
of
;
and
altogether
it
was
more
than
I
could
bear
;
and
so
I
never
would
finish
it
,
to
have
it
apologised
over
as
an
unfavourable
likeness
,
to
every
morning
visitor
in
Brunswick
Square
;
 
and
,
as
I
said
,
I
did
then
forswear
ever
drawing
any
body
again
.
<EOS>
But
for
Harriet
's
sake
,
or
rather
for
my
own
,
and
as
there
are
no
husbands
and
wives
in
the
case
_
at
_
_
<EOS>
present
_
,
I
will
break
my
resolution
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Elton
seemed
very
properly
struck
and
delighted
by
the
idea
,
and
was
repeating
,
"
No
husbands
and
wives
in
the
case
at
present
indeed
,
as
you
observe
.
<EOS>
Exactly
so
.
<EOS>
No
husbands
and
wives
,
"
with
so
interesting
a
consciousness
,
that
Emma
began
to
consider
whether
she
had
not
better
leave
them
together
at
once
.
<EOS>
But
as
she
wanted
to
be
drawing
,
the
declaration
must
wait
a
little
longer
.
  
<EOS>
She
had
soon
fixed
on
the
size
and
sort
of
portrait
.
<EOS>
It
was
to
be
a
whole
-
length
in
water
-
colours
,
like
Mr.
John
Knightley
's
,
and
was
destined
,
if
she
could
please
herself
,
to
hold
a
very
honourable
station
over
the
mantelpiece
.
  
<EOS>
The
sitting
began
;
and
Harriet
,
smiling
and
blushing
,
and
afraid
of
not
keeping
her
attitude
and
countenance
,
presented
a
very
sweet
mixture
of
youthful
expression
to
the
steady
eyes
of
the
artist
.
<EOS>
But
there
was
no
doing
any
thing
,
with
Mr.
Elton
fidgeting
behind
her
and
watching
every
touch
.
<EOS>
She
gave
him
credit
for
stationing
himself
where
he
might
gaze
and
gaze
again
without
offence
;
but
was
really
obliged
to
put
an
end
to
it
,
and
request
him
to
place
himself
elsewhere
.
<EOS>
It
then
occurred
to
her
to
employ
him
in
reading
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
he
would
be
so
good
as
to
read
to
them
,
it
would
be
a
kindness
indeed
!
<EOS>
It
would
amuse
away
the
difficulties
of
her
part
,
and
lessen
the
irksomeness
of
Miss
Smith
's
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Elton
was
only
too
happy
.
<EOS>
Harriet
listened
,
and
Emma
drew
in
peace
.
<EOS>
She
must
allow
him
to
be
still
frequently
coming
to
look
;
any
thing
less
would
certainly
have
been
too
little
in
a
lover
;
and
he
was
ready
at
the
smallest
intermission
of
the
pencil
,
to
jump
up
and
see
the
progress
,
and
be
charmed
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
no
being
displeased
with
such
an
encourager
,
for
his
admiration
made
him
discern
a
likeness
almost
before
it
was
possible
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
respect
his
eye
,
but
his
love
and
his
complaisance
were
unexceptionable
.
  
<EOS>
The
sitting
was
altogether
very
satisfactory
;
she
was
quite
enough
pleased
with
the
first
day
's
sketch
to
wish
to
go
on
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
want
of
likeness
,
she
had
been
fortunate
in
the
attitude
,
and
as
she
meant
to
throw
in
a
little
improvement
to
the
figure
,
to
give
a
little
more
height
,
and
considerably
more
elegance
,
she
had
great
confidence
of
its
being
in
every
way
a
pretty
drawing
at
last
,
and
of
its
filling
its
destined
place
with
credit
to
them
both
 
a
standing
memorial
of
the
beauty
of
one
,
the
skill
of
the
other
,
and
the
friendship
of
both
;
with
as
many
other
agreeable
associations
as
Mr.
Elton
's
very
promising
attachment
was
likely
to
add
.
  
<EOS>
Harriet
was
to
sit
again
the
next
day
;
and
Mr.
Elton
,
just
as
he
ought
,
entreated
for
the
permission
of
attending
and
reading
to
them
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
By
all
means
.
<EOS>
We
shall
be
most
happy
to
consider
you
as
one
of
the
party
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
same
civilities
and
courtesies
,
the
same
success
and
satisfaction
,
took
place
on
the
morrow
,
and
accompanied
the
whole
progress
of
the
picture
,
which
was
rapid
and
happy
.
<EOS>
Every
body
who
saw
it
was
pleased
,
but
Mr.
Elton
was
in
continual
raptures
,
and
defended
it
through
every
criticism
.
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Woodhouse
has
given
her
friend
the
only
beauty
she
wanted
,
"
 
observed
Mrs.
Weston
to
him
 
not
in
the
least
suspecting
that
she
was
addressing
a
lover
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
expression
of
the
eye
is
most
correct
,
but
Miss
Smith
has
not
those
eyebrows
and
eyelashes
.
<EOS>
It
is
the
fault
of
her
face
that
she
has
them
not
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
think
so
?
"
replied
he
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
agree
with
you
.
<EOS>
It
appears
to
me
a
most
perfect
resemblance
in
every
feature
.
<EOS>
I
never
saw
such
a
likeness
in
my
life
.
<EOS>
We
must
allow
for
the
effect
of
shade
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
made
her
too
tall
,
Emma
,
"
said
Mr.
Knightley
.
  
<EOS>
Emma
knew
that
she
had
,
but
would
not
own
it
;
and
Mr.
Elton
warmly
added
,
  
"
<EOS>
Oh
no
!
<EOS>
certainly
not
too
tall
;
not
in
the
least
too
tall
.
<EOS>
Consider
,
she
is
sitting
down
 
which
naturally
presents
a
different
 
which
in
short
gives
exactly
the
idea
 
and
the
proportions
must
be
preserved
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
Proportions
,
fore
-
shortening
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
no
!
<EOS>
it
gives
one
exactly
the
idea
of
such
a
height
as
Miss
Smith
's
.
<EOS>
Exactly
so
indeed
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
very
pretty
,
"
said
Mr.
Woodhouse
.
<EOS>
"
So
prettily
done
!
<EOS>
Just
as
your
drawings
always
are
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
any
body
who
draws
so
well
as
you
do
.
<EOS>
The
only
thing
I
do
not
thoroughly
like
is
,
that
she
seems
to
be
sitting
out
of
doors
,
with
only
a
little
shawl
over
her
shoulders
 
<EOS>
and
it
makes
one
think
she
must
catch
cold
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
my
dear
papa
,
it
is
supposed
to
be
summer
;
a
warm
day
in
summer
.
<EOS>
Look
at
the
tree
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
it
is
never
safe
to
sit
out
of
doors
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
,
sir
,
may
say
any
thing
,
"
cried
Mr.
Elton
,
"
but
I
must
confess
that
I
regard
it
as
a
most
happy
thought
,
the
placing
of
Miss
Smith
out
of
doors
;
and
the
tree
is
touched
with
such
inimitable
spirit
!
<EOS>
Any
other
situation
would
have
been
much
less
in
character
.
<EOS>
The
naivete
of
Miss
Smith
's
manners
 
and
altogether
 
Oh
,
it
is
most
admirable
!
<EOS>
I
can
not
keep
my
eyes
from
it
.
<EOS>
I
never
saw
such
a
likeness
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
next
thing
wanted
was
to
get
the
picture
framed
;
and
here
were
a
few
difficulties
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
done
directly
;
it
must
be
done
in
London
;
the
order
must
go
through
the
hands
of
some
intelligent
person
whose
taste
could
be
depended
on
;
and
Isabella
,
the
usual
doer
of
all
commissions
,
must
not
be
applied
to
,
because
it
was
December
,
and
Mr.
Woodhouse
could
not
bear
the
idea
of
her
stirring
out
of
her
house
in
the
fogs
of
December
.
<EOS>
But
no
sooner
was
the
distress
known
to
Mr.
Elton
,
than
it
was
removed
.
<EOS>
His
gallantry
was
always
on
the
alert
.
<EOS>
"
Might
he
be
trusted
with
the
commission
,
what
infinite
pleasure
should
he
have
in
executing
it
!
<EOS>
he
could
ride
to
London
at
any
time
.
<EOS>
It
was
impossible
to
say
how
much
he
should
be
gratified
by
being
employed
on
such
an
errand
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
was
too
good
!
 
<EOS>
she
could
not
endure
the
thought
!
 
<EOS>
she
would
not
give
him
such
a
troublesome
office
for
the
world
,
"
 
brought
on
the
desired
repetition
of
entreaties
and
assurances
,
 
and
a
very
few
minutes
settled
the
business
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Elton
was
to
take
the
drawing
to
London
,
chuse
the
frame
,
and
give
the
directions
;
and
Emma
thought
she
could
so
pack
it
as
to
ensure
its
safety
without
much
incommoding
him
,
while
he
seemed
mostly
fearful
of
not
being
incommoded
enough
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
a
precious
deposit
!
"
said
he
with
a
tender
sigh
,
as
he
received
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
This
man
is
almost
too
gallant
to
be
in
love
,
"
thought
Emma
.
<EOS>
"
I
should
say
so
,
but
that
I
suppose
there
may
be
a
hundred
different
ways
of
being
in
love
.
<EOS>
He
is
an
excellent
young
man
,
and
will
suit
Harriet
exactly
;
it
will
be
an
"
Exactly
so
,
"
as
he
says
himself
;
but
he
does
sigh
and
languish
,
and
study
for
compliments
rather
more
than
I
could
endure
as
a
principal
.
<EOS>
I
come
in
for
a
pretty
good
share
as
a
second
.
<EOS>
But
it
is
his
gratitude
on
Harriet
's
account
.
"
    
<EOS>
The
very
day
of
Mr.
Elton
's
going
to
London
produced
a
fresh
occasion
for
Emma
's
services
towards
her
friend
.
<EOS>
Harriet
had
been
at
Hartfield
,
as
usual
,
soon
after
breakfast
;
and
,
after
a
time
,
had
gone
home
to
return
again
to
dinner
<EOS>
:
she
returned
,
and
sooner
than
had
been
talked
of
,
and
with
an
agitated
,
hurried
look
,
announcing
something
extraordinary
to
have
happened
which
she
was
longing
to
tell
.
<EOS>
Half
a
minute
brought
it
all
out
.
<EOS>
She
had
heard
,
as
soon
as
she
got
back
to
Mrs.
Goddard
's
,
that
Mr.
Martin
had
been
there
an
hour
before
,
and
finding
she
was
not
at
home
,
nor
particularly
expected
,
<EOS>
had
left
a
little
parcel
for
her
from
one
of
his
sisters
,
and
gone
away
;
and
on
opening
this
parcel
,
she
had
actually
found
,
besides
the
two
songs
which
she
had
lent
Elizabeth
to
copy
,
a
letter
to
herself
;
and
this
letter
was
from
him
,
from
Mr.
Martin
,
and
contained
a
direct
proposal
of
marriage
.
<EOS>
"
Who
could
have
thought
it
?
<EOS>
She
was
so
surprized
she
did
not
know
what
to
do
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
quite
a
proposal
of
marriage
;
and
a
very
good
letter
<EOS>
,
at
least
she
thought
so
.
<EOS>
And
he
wrote
as
if
he
really
loved
her
very
much
 
<EOS>
but
she
did
not
know
 
<EOS>
and
so
,
she
was
come
as
fast
as
she
could
to
ask
Miss
Woodhouse
what
she
should
do
.
 
<EOS>
"
Emma
was
half
-
ashamed
of
her
friend
for
seeming
so
pleased
and
so
doubtful
.
  
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
word
,
"
she
cried
,
"
the
young
man
is
determined
not
to
lose
any
thing
for
want
of
asking
.
<EOS>
He
will
connect
himself
well
if
he
can
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
read
the
letter
?
"
cried
Harriet
.
<EOS>
"
Pray
do
.
<EOS>
I
'd
rather
you
would
.
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
was
not
sorry
to
be
pressed
.
<EOS>
She
read
,
and
was
surprized
.
<EOS>
The
style
of
the
letter
was
much
above
her
expectation
.
<EOS>
There
were
not
merely
no
grammatical
errors
,
but
as
a
composition
it
would
not
have
disgraced
a
gentleman
;
the
language
,
though
plain
,
was
strong
and
unaffected
,
and
the
sentiments
it
conveyed
very
much
to
the
credit
of
the
writer
.
<EOS>
It
was
short
,
but
expressed
good
sense
,
warm
attachment
,
liberality
,
propriety
,
even
delicacy
of
feeling
.
<EOS>
She
paused
over
it
,
while
Harriet
stood
anxiously
watching
for
her
opinion
,
with
a
"
Well
,
well
,
"
and
was
at
last
forced
to
add
,
"
Is
it
a
good
letter
?
<EOS>
or
is
it
too
short
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
indeed
,
a
very
good
letter
,
"
replied
Emma
rather
slowly
 
"
so
good
a
letter
,
Harriet
,
that
every
thing
considered
<EOS>
,
I
think
one
of
his
sisters
must
have
helped
him
.
<EOS>
I
can
hardly
imagine
the
young
man
whom
I
saw
talking
with
you
the
other
day
could
express
himself
so
well
,
if
left
quite
to
his
own
powers
,
and
yet
it
is
not
the
style
of
a
woman
;
no
,
certainly
,
it
is
too
strong
and
concise
;
not
diffuse
enough
for
a
woman
.
<EOS>
No
doubt
he
is
a
sensible
man
,
and
I
suppose
may
have
a
natural
talent
for
 
thinks
strongly
and
clearly
 
<EOS>
and
when
he
takes
a
pen
in
hand
,
his
thoughts
naturally
find
proper
words
.
<EOS>
It
is
so
with
some
men
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
I
understand
the
sort
of
mind
.
<EOS>
Vigorous
,
decided
,
with
sentiments
to
a
certain
point
,
not
coarse
.
<EOS>
A
better
written
letter
,
Harriet
(
returning
it
,
)
than
I
had
expected
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
said
the
still
waiting
Harriet
;
 
"
well
 
and
 
and
what
shall
I
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
shall
you
do
!
<EOS>
In
what
respect
?
<EOS>
Do
you
mean
with
regard
to
this
letter
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
what
are
you
in
doubt
of
?
<EOS>
You
must
answer
it
of
course
 
and
speedily
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
But
what
shall
I
say
?
<EOS>
Dear
Miss
Woodhouse
,
do
advise
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
no
,
no
!
<EOS>
the
letter
had
much
better
be
all
your
own
.
<EOS>
You
will
express
yourself
very
properly
,
I
am
sure
.
<EOS>
There
is
no
danger
of
your
not
being
intelligible
,
which
is
the
first
thing
.
<EOS>
Your
meaning
must
be
unequivocal
;
no
doubts
or
demurs
:
and
such
expressions
of
gratitude
and
concern
for
the
pain
you
are
inflicting
as
propriety
requires
,
will
present
themselves
unbidden
to
_
<EOS>
your
_
mind
,
I
am
persuaded
.
<EOS>
You
need
not
be
prompted
to
write
with
the
appearance
of
sorrow
for
his
disappointment
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
think
I
ought
to
refuse
him
then
,
"
said
Harriet
,
looking
down
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ought
to
refuse
him
!
<EOS>
My
dear
Harriet
,
what
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
Are
you
in
any
doubt
as
to
that
?
<EOS>
I
thought
 
<EOS>
but
I
beg
your
pardon
<EOS>
,
perhaps
I
have
been
under
a
mistake
.
<EOS>
I
certainly
have
been
misunderstanding
you
,
if
you
feel
in
doubt
as
to
the
_
purport
_
of
your
answer
.
<EOS>
I
had
imagined
you
were
consulting
me
only
as
to
the
wording
of
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Harriet
was
silent
.
<EOS>
With
a
little
reserve
of
manner
,
Emma
continued
:
  
"
You
mean
to
return
a
favourable
answer
,
I
collect
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
do
not
;
that
is
,
I
do
not
mean
 
<EOS>
What
shall
I
do
?
<EOS>
What
would
you
advise
me
to
do
?
<EOS>
Pray
,
dear
Miss
Woodhouse
,
tell
me
what
I
ought
to
do
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
not
give
you
any
advice
,
Harriet
.
<EOS>
I
will
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
.
<EOS>
This
is
a
point
which
you
must
settle
with
your
feelings
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
had
no
notion
that
he
liked
me
so
very
much
,
"
said
Harriet
,
contemplating
the
letter
.
<EOS>
For
a
little
while
Emma
persevered
in
her
silence
;
but
beginning
to
apprehend
the
bewitching
flattery
of
that
letter
might
be
too
powerful
,
she
thought
it
best
to
say
,
  
"
I
lay
it
down
as
a
general
rule
,
Harriet
,
that
if
a
woman
_
doubts
_
as
to
whether
she
should
accept
a
man
or
not
,
she
certainly
ought
to
refuse
him
.
<EOS>
If
she
can
hesitate
as
to
"
Yes
,
"
she
ought
to
say
"
No
"
directly
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
a
state
to
be
safely
entered
into
with
doubtful
feelings
,
with
half
a
heart
.
<EOS>
I
thought
it
my
duty
as
a
friend
,
and
older
than
yourself
,
to
say
thus
much
to
you
.
<EOS>
But
do
not
imagine
that
I
want
to
influence
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
no
,
I
am
sure
you
are
a
great
deal
too
kind
to
 
<EOS>
but
if
you
would
just
advise
me
what
I
had
best
do
 
<EOS>
No
,
no
,
I
do
not
mean
that
 
As
you
say
,
one
's
mind
ought
to
be
quite
made
up
 
One
should
not
be
hesitating
 
<EOS>
It
is
a
very
serious
thing
.
 
<EOS>
It
will
be
safer
to
say
"
No
,
"
perhaps
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
think
I
had
better
say
"
No
?
"
<EOS>
"
  
"
Not
for
the
world
,
"
said
Emma
,
smiling
graciously
,
"
would
I
advise
you
either
way
.
<EOS>
You
must
be
the
best
judge
of
your
own
happiness
.
<EOS>
If
you
prefer
Mr.
Martin
to
every
other
person
;
if
you
think
him
the
most
agreeable
man
you
have
ever
been
in
company
with
,
why
should
you
hesitate
?
<EOS>
You
blush
,
Harriet
.
 
<EOS>
Does
any
body
else
occur
to
you
at
this
moment
under
such
a
definition
?
<EOS>
Harriet
,
Harriet
,
do
not
deceive
yourself
;
do
not
be
run
away
with
by
gratitude
and
compassion
.
<EOS>
At
this
moment
whom
are
you
thinking
of
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
symptoms
were
favourable
.
 
<EOS>
Instead
of
answering
,
Harriet
turned
away
confused
,
and
stood
thoughtfully
by
the
fire
;
and
though
the
letter
was
still
in
her
hand
,
it
was
now
mechanically
twisted
about
without
regard
.
<EOS>
Emma
waited
the
result
with
impatience
,
but
not
without
strong
hopes
.
<EOS>
At
last
,
with
some
hesitation
,
Harriet
said
    
"
Miss
Woodhouse
,
as
you
will
not
give
me
your
opinion
,
I
must
do
as
well
as
I
can
by
myself
;
and
I
have
now
quite
determined
,
and
really
almost
made
up
my
mind
 
to
refuse
Mr.
Martin
.
<EOS>
Do
you
think
I
am
right
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Perfectly
,
perfectly
right
,
my
dearest
Harriet
;
you
are
doing
just
what
you
ought
.
<EOS>
While
you
were
at
all
in
suspense
I
kept
my
feelings
to
myself
,
but
now
that
you
are
so
completely
decided
I
have
no
hesitation
in
approving
.
<EOS>
Dear
Harriet
,
I
give
myself
joy
of
this
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
grieved
me
to
lose
your
acquaintance
,
which
must
have
been
the
consequence
of
your
marrying
Mr.
Martin
.
<EOS>
While
you
were
in
the
smallest
degree
wavering
,
I
said
nothing
about
it
,
because
I
would
not
influence
;
but
it
would
have
been
the
loss
of
a
friend
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
have
visited
Mrs.
Robert
Martin
,
of
Abbey
-
Mill
Farm
.
<EOS>
Now
I
am
secure
of
you
for
ever
.
"
  
<EOS>
Harriet
had
not
surmised
her
own
danger
,
but
the
idea
of
it
struck
her
forcibly
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
could
not
have
visited
me
!
"
<EOS>
she
cried
,
looking
aghast
.
"
<EOS>
No
,
to
be
sure
you
could
not
;
but
I
never
thought
of
that
before
.
<EOS>
That
would
have
been
too
dreadful
!
 
<EOS>
What
an
escape
!
 
<EOS>
Dear
Miss
Woodhouse
,
I
would
not
give
up
the
pleasure
and
honour
of
being
intimate
with
you
for
any
thing
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Indeed
,
Harriet
,
it
would
have
been
a
severe
pang
to
lose
you
;
but
it
must
have
been
.
<EOS>
You
would
have
thrown
yourself
out
of
all
good
society
.
<EOS>
I
must
have
given
you
up
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
!
 
<EOS>
How
should
I
ever
have
borne
it
!
<EOS>
It
would
have
killed
me
never
to
come
to
Hartfield
any
more
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
affectionate
creature
!
 
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
You
_
banished
to
Abbey
-
Mill
Farm
!
 
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
You
_
confined
to
the
society
of
the
illiterate
and
vulgar
all
your
life
!
<EOS>
I
wonder
how
the
young
man
could
have
the
assurance
to
ask
it
.
<EOS>
He
must
have
a
pretty
good
opinion
of
himself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
he
is
conceited
either
,
in
general
,
"
said
Harriet
,
<EOS>
her
conscience
opposing
such
censure
;
"
at
least
,
he
is
very
good
natured
,
and
I
shall
always
feel
much
obliged
to
him
,
and
have
a
great
regard
for
 
<EOS>
but
that
is
quite
a
different
thing
from
 
<EOS>
and
you
know
,
though
he
may
like
me
,
it
does
not
follow
that
I
should
 
<EOS>
and
certainly
I
must
confess
that
since
my
visiting
here
I
have
seen
people
 
and
if
one
comes
to
compare
them
,
person
and
manners
,
there
is
no
comparison
at
all
<EOS>
,
_
one
_
is
so
very
handsome
and
agreeable
.
<EOS>
However
,
I
do
really
think
Mr.
Martin
a
very
amiable
young
man
,
and
have
a
great
opinion
of
him
;
and
his
being
so
much
attached
to
me
 
and
his
writing
such
a
letter
 
<EOS>
but
as
to
leaving
you
,
it
is
what
I
would
not
do
upon
any
consideration
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
thank
you
,
my
own
sweet
little
friend
.
<EOS>
We
will
not
be
parted
.
<EOS>
A
woman
is
not
to
marry
a
man
merely
because
she
is
asked
,
or
because
he
is
attached
to
her
,
and
can
write
a
tolerable
letter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
no
;
 
<EOS>
and
it
is
<EOS>
but
a
short
letter
too
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
felt
the
bad
taste
of
her
friend
,
but
let
it
pass
with
a
"
very
true
;
and
it
would
be
a
small
consolation
to
her
,
for
the
clownish
manner
which
might
be
offending
her
every
hour
of
the
day
,
to
know
that
her
husband
could
write
a
good
letter
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
yes
,
very
.
<EOS>
Nobody
cares
for
a
letter
;
the
thing
is
,
to
be
always
happy
with
pleasant
companions
.
<EOS>
I
am
quite
determined
to
refuse
him
.
<EOS>
But
how
shall
I
do
?
<EOS>
What
shall
I
say
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
assured
her
there
would
be
no
difficulty
in
the
answer
,
and
advised
its
being
written
directly
,
which
was
agreed
to
,
in
the
hope
of
her
assistance
;
and
though
Emma
continued
to
protest
against
any
assistance
being
wanted
,
it
was
in
fact
given
in
the
formation
of
every
sentence
.
<EOS>
The
looking
over
his
letter
again
,
in
replying
to
it
,
had
such
a
softening
tendency
,
that
it
was
particularly
necessary
to
brace
her
up
with
a
few
decisive
expressions
;
and
she
was
so
very
much
concerned
at
the
idea
of
making
him
unhappy
,
and
thought
so
much
of
what
his
mother
and
sisters
would
think
and
say
,
and
was
so
anxious
that
they
should
not
fancy
her
ungrateful
,
that
Emma
believed
if
the
young
man
had
come
in
her
way
at
that
moment
,
he
would
have
been
accepted
after
all
.
  
<EOS>
This
letter
,
however
,
was
written
,
and
sealed
,
and
sent
.
<EOS>
The
business
was
finished
,
and
Harriet
safe
.
<EOS>
She
was
rather
low
all
the
evening
,
but
Emma
could
allow
for
her
amiable
regrets
,
and
sometimes
relieved
them
by
speaking
of
her
own
affection
,
sometimes
by
bringing
forward
the
idea
of
Mr.
Elton
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
never
be
invited
to
Abbey
-
Mill
again
,
"
was
said
in
rather
a
sorrowful
tone
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Nor
,
if
you
were
,
could
I
ever
bear
to
part
with
you
,
my
Harriet
.
<EOS>
You
are
a
great
deal
too
necessary
at
Hartfield
to
be
spared
to
Abbey
-
Mill
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
am
sure
I
should
never
want
to
go
there
;
for
I
am
never
happy
but
at
Hartfield
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Some
time
afterwards
it
was
,
"
I
think
Mrs.
Goddard
would
be
very
much
surprized
if
she
knew
what
had
happened
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
Miss
Nash
would
 
for
Miss
Nash
thinks
her
own
sister
very
well
married
,
and
it
is
only
a
linen
-
draper
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
One
should
be
sorry
to
see
greater
pride
or
refinement
in
the
teacher
of
a
school
,
Harriet
.
<EOS>
I
dare
say
Miss
Nash
would
envy
you
such
an
opportunity
as
this
of
being
married
.
<EOS>
Even
this
conquest
would
appear
valuable
in
her
eyes
.
<EOS>
As
to
any
thing
superior
for
you
,
I
suppose
she
is
quite
in
the
dark
.
<EOS>
The
attentions
of
a
certain
person
can
hardly
be
among
the
tittle
-
tattle
of
Highbury
yet
.
<EOS>
Hitherto
<EOS>
I
fancy
you
<EOS>
and
I
are
the
only
people
to
whom
his
looks
and
manners
have
explained
themselves
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Harriet
blushed
and
smiled
,
and
said
something
about
wondering
that
people
should
like
her
so
much
.
<EOS>
The
idea
of
Mr.
Elton
was
certainly
cheering
;
but
still
,
after
a
time
,
she
was
tender
-
hearted
again
towards
the
rejected
Mr.
Martin
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
he
has
got
my
letter
,
"
said
she
softly
.
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
what
they
are
all
doing
 
whether
his
sisters
know
 
if
he
is
unhappy
,
they
will
be
unhappy
too
.
<EOS>
I
hope
he
will
not
mind
it
so
very
much
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Let
us
think
of
those
among
our
absent
friends
who
are
more
cheerfully
employed
,
"
cried
Emma
.
<EOS>
"
At
this
moment
,
perhaps
,
Mr.
Elton
is
shewing
your
picture
to
his
mother
and
sisters
,
telling
how
much
more
beautiful
is
the
original
,
and
after
being
asked
for
it
five
or
six
times
,
allowing
them
to
hear
your
name
,
your
own
dear
name
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
My
picture
!
 
<EOS>
But
he
has
left
my
picture
in
Bond
-
street
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Has
he
so
!
 
<EOS>
Then
I
know
nothing
of
Mr.
Elton
.
<EOS>
No
,
my
dear
little
modest
Harriet
,
depend
upon
it
the
picture
will
not
be
in
Bond
-
street
till
just
before
he
mounts
his
horse
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
It
is
his
companion
all
this
evening
,
his
solace
,
his
delight
.
<EOS>
It
opens
his
designs
to
his
family
,
it
introduces
you
among
them
,
it
diffuses
through
the
party
those
pleasantest
feelings
of
our
nature
,
eager
curiosity
and
warm
prepossession
.
<EOS>
How
cheerful
,
how
animated
,
how
suspicious
,
how
busy
their
imaginations
all
are
!
"
  
<EOS>
Harriet
smiled
again
,
and
her
smiles
grew
stronger
.
    
<EOS>
Harriet
slept
at
Hartfield
that
night
.
<EOS>
For
some
weeks
past
she
had
been
spending
more
than
half
her
time
there
,
and
gradually
getting
to
have
a
bed
-
room
appropriated
to
herself
;
and
Emma
judged
it
best
in
every
respect
,
safest
and
kindest
,
to
keep
her
with
them
as
much
as
possible
just
at
present
.
<EOS>
She
was
obliged
to
go
the
next
morning
for
an
hour
or
two
to
Mrs.
Goddard
's
,
but
it
was
then
to
be
settled
that
she
should
return
to
Hartfield
,
to
make
a
regular
visit
of
some
days
.
  
<EOS>
While
she
was
gone
,
Mr.
Knightley
called
,
and
sat
some
time
with
Mr.
Woodhouse
and
Emma
,
till
Mr.
Woodhouse
,
who
had
previously
made
up
his
mind
to
walk
out
,
was
persuaded
by
his
daughter
not
to
defer
it
,
and
was
induced
by
the
entreaties
of
both
,
though
against
the
scruples
of
his
own
civility
,
to
leave
Mr.
Knightley
for
that
purpose
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Knightley
,
who
had
nothing
of
ceremony
about
him
,
was
offering
by
his
short
,
decided
answers
,
an
amusing
contrast
to
the
protracted
apologies
and
civil
hesitations
of
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
I
believe
,
if
you
will
excuse
me
,
Mr.
Knightley
,
if
you
will
not
consider
me
as
doing
a
very
rude
thing
,
I
shall
take
Emma
's
advice
and
go
out
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
.
<EOS>
As
the
sun
is
out
,
I
believe
I
had
better
take
my
three
turns
while
I
can
.
<EOS>
I
treat
you
without
ceremony
,
Mr.
Knightley
.
<EOS>
We
invalids
think
we
are
privileged
people
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
sir
,
do
not
make
a
stranger
of
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
leave
an
excellent
substitute
in
my
daughter
.
<EOS>
Emma
will
be
happy
to
entertain
you
.
<EOS>
And
therefore
I
think
I
will
beg
your
excuse
and
take
my
three
turns
 
my
winter
walk
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
can
not
do
better
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
ask
for
the
pleasure
of
your
company
,
Mr.
Knightley
,
but
I
am
a
very
slow
walker
,
and
my
pace
would
be
tedious
to
you
;
and
,
besides
,
you
have
another
long
walk
before
you
,
to
Donwell
Abbey
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
sir
,
thank
you
;
I
am
going
this
moment
myself
;
and
I
think
the
sooner
_
<EOS>
you
_
go
the
better
.
<EOS>
I
will
fetch
your
greatcoat
and
open
the
garden
door
for
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Woodhouse
at
last
was
off
;
but
Mr.
Knightley
,
instead
of
being
immediately
off
likewise
,
sat
down
again
,
seemingly
inclined
for
more
chat
.
<EOS>
He
began
speaking
of
Harriet
,
and
speaking
of
her
with
more
voluntary
praise
than
Emma
had
ever
heard
before
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
rate
her
beauty
as
you
do
,
"
said
he
;
"
but
she
is
a
pretty
little
creature
,
and
I
am
inclined
to
think
very
well
of
her
disposition
.
<EOS>
Her
character
depends
upon
those
she
is
with
;
but
in
good
hands
she
will
turn
out
a
valuable
woman
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
you
think
so
;
and
the
good
hands
,
I
hope
,
may
not
be
wanting
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Come
,
"
said
he
,
<EOS>
"
you
are
anxious
for
a
compliment
,
so
I
will
tell
you
that
you
have
improved
her
.
<EOS>
You
have
cured
her
of
her
school
-
girl
's
giggle
;
she
really
does
you
credit
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
.
<EOS>
I
should
be
mortified
indeed
if
I
did
not
believe
I
had
been
of
some
use
;
but
it
is
not
every
body
who
will
bestow
praise
where
they
may
.
<EOS>
_
You
_
do
not
often
overpower
me
with
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
expecting
her
again
,
you
say
,
this
morning
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Almost
every
moment
.
<EOS>
She
has
been
gone
longer
already
than
she
intended
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Something
has
happened
to
delay
her
;
some
visitors
perhaps
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Highbury
gossips
!
 
<EOS>
Tiresome
wretches
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Harriet
may
not
consider
every
body
tiresome
that
you
would
.
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
knew
this
was
too
true
for
contradiction
,
and
therefore
said
nothing
.
<EOS>
He
presently
added
,
with
a
smile
,
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
pretend
to
fix
on
times
or
places
,
but
I
must
tell
you
that
I
have
good
reason
to
believe
your
little
friend
will
soon
hear
of
something
to
her
advantage
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Indeed
!
<EOS>
how
so
?
<EOS>
of
what
sort
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
very
serious
sort
<EOS>
,
I
assure
you
;
"
still
smiling
.
  
<EOS>
"
Very
serious
!
<EOS>
I
can
think
of
but
one
thing
 
<EOS>
Who
is
in
love
with
her
?
<EOS>
Who
makes
you
their
confidant
?
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
was
more
than
half
in
hopes
of
Mr.
Elton
's
<EOS>
having
dropt
a
hint
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Knightley
was
a
sort
of
general
friend
and
adviser
,
and
she
knew
Mr.
Elton
looked
up
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
reason
to
think
,
"
he
replied
,
"
that
Harriet
Smith
will
soon
have
an
offer
of
marriage
,
and
from
a
most
unexceptionable
quarter
:
 
<EOS>
Robert
Martin
is
the
man
.
<EOS>
Her
visit
to
Abbey
-
Mill
,
this
summer
,
seems
to
have
done
his
business
.
<EOS>
He
is
desperately
in
love
and
means
to
marry
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
very
obliging
,
"
said
Emma
;
"
but
is
he
sure
that
Harriet
means
to
marry
him
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
well
,
means
to
make
her
an
offer
then
.
<EOS>
Will
that
do
?
<EOS>
He
came
to
the
Abbey
two
evenings
ago
,
on
purpose
to
consult
me
about
it
.
<EOS>
He
knows
I
have
a
thorough
regard
for
him
and
all
his
family
,
and
,
I
believe
,
considers
me
as
one
of
his
best
friends
.
<EOS>
He
came
to
ask
me
whether
I
thought
it
would
be
imprudent
in
him
to
settle
so
early
;
whether
I
thought
her
too
young
:
in
short
,
whether
I
approved
his
choice
altogether
;
having
some
apprehension
perhaps
of
her
being
considered
(
especially
since
_
your
_
making
so
much
of
her
)
as
in
a
line
of
society
above
him
.
<EOS>
I
was
very
much
pleased
with
all
that
he
said
.
<EOS>
I
never
hear
better
sense
from
any
one
than
Robert
Martin
.
<EOS>
He
always
speaks
to
the
purpose
;
open
,
straightforward
,
and
very
well
judging
.
<EOS>
He
told
me
every
thing
;
his
circumstances
and
plans
,
and
what
they
all
proposed
doing
in
the
event
of
his
marriage
.
<EOS>
He
is
an
excellent
young
man
,
both
as
son
and
brother
.
<EOS>
I
had
no
hesitation
in
advising
him
to
marry
.
<EOS>
He
proved
to
me
that
he
could
afford
it
;
and
that
being
the
case
,
I
was
convinced
he
could
not
do
better
.
<EOS>
I
praised
the
fair
lady
too
,
and
altogether
sent
him
away
very
happy
.
<EOS>
If
he
had
never
esteemed
my
opinion
before
,
he
would
have
thought
highly
of
me
then
;
and
,
I
dare
say
,
left
the
house
thinking
me
the
best
friend
and
counsellor
man
ever
had
.
<EOS>
This
happened
the
night
before
last
.
<EOS>
Now
,
as
we
may
fairly
suppose
,
he
would
not
allow
much
time
to
pass
before
he
spoke
to
the
lady
,
and
as
he
does
not
appear
to
have
spoken
yesterday
,
it
is
not
unlikely
that
he
should
be
at
Mrs.
Goddard
's
to
-
day
;
and
she
may
be
detained
by
a
visitor
,
without
thinking
him
at
all
a
tiresome
wretch
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Pray
,
Mr.
Knightley
,
"
said
Emma
,
who
had
been
smiling
to
herself
through
a
great
part
of
this
speech
,
"
how
do
you
know
that
Mr.
Martin
did
not
speak
yesterday
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Certainly
,
"
replied
he
,
surprized
,
"
I
do
not
absolutely
know
it
;
but
it
may
be
inferred
.
<EOS>
Was
not
she
the
whole
day
with
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Come
,
"
said
she
,
"
I
will
tell
you
something
,
in
return
for
what
you
have
told
me
.
<EOS>
He
did
speak
yesterday
 
that
is
,
he
wrote
,
and
was
refused
.
"
  
<EOS>
This
was
obliged
to
be
repeated
before
it
could
be
believed
;
and
Mr.
Knightley
actually
looked
red
with
surprize
and
displeasure
,
as
he
stood
up
,
in
tall
indignation
,
and
said
,
  
"
<EOS>
Then
she
is
a
greater
simpleton
than
I
ever
believed
her
.
<EOS>
What
is
the
foolish
girl
about
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
to
be
sure
,
"
cried
Emma
,
"
it
is
always
incomprehensible
to
a
man
that
a
woman
should
ever
refuse
an
offer
of
marriage
.
<EOS>
A
man
always
imagines
a
woman
to
be
ready
for
any
body
who
asks
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nonsense
!
<EOS>
a
man
does
not
imagine
any
such
thing
.
<EOS>
But
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
?
<EOS>
Harriet
Smith
refuse
Robert
Martin
?
<EOS>
madness
,
if
it
is
so
<EOS>
;
but
I
hope
you
are
mistaken
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
saw
her
answer
!
 
<EOS>
nothing
could
be
clearer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
saw
her
answer
!
 
<EOS>
you
wrote
her
answer
too
.
<EOS>
Emma
,
this
is
your
doing
.
<EOS>
You
persuaded
her
to
refuse
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
if
I
did
,
(
which
,
however
,
I
am
far
from
allowing
)
<EOS>
I
should
not
feel
that
I
had
done
wrong
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Martin
is
a
very
respectable
young
man
,
but
I
can
not
admit
him
to
be
Harriet
's
equal
;
and
am
rather
surprized
indeed
that
he
should
have
ventured
to
address
her
.
<EOS>
By
your
account
,
he
does
seem
to
have
had
some
scruples
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
pity
that
they
were
ever
got
over
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
Not
Harriet
's
equal
!
"
exclaimed
Mr.
Knightley
loudly
and
warmly
;
and
with
calmer
asperity
,
added
,
a
few
moments
afterwards
,
"
No
,
he
is
not
her
equal
indeed
,
for
he
is
as
much
her
superior
in
sense
as
in
situation
.
<EOS>
Emma
,
your
infatuation
about
that
girl
blinds
you
.
<EOS>
What
are
Harriet
Smith
's
claims
,
either
of
birth
,
nature
or
education
,
to
any
connexion
higher
than
Robert
Martin
?
<EOS>
She
is
the
natural
daughter
of
nobody
knows
whom
,
with
probably
no
settled
provision
at
all
,
and
certainly
no
respectable
relations
.
<EOS>
She
is
known
only
as
parlour
-
boarder
at
a
common
school
.
<EOS>
She
is
not
a
sensible
girl
,
nor
a
girl
of
any
information
.
<EOS>
She
has
been
taught
nothing
useful
,
and
is
too
young
and
too
simple
to
have
acquired
any
thing
herself
.
<EOS>
At
her
age
she
can
have
no
experience
,
and
with
her
little
wit
,
is
not
very
likely
ever
to
have
any
that
can
avail
her
.
<EOS>
She
is
pretty
,
and
she
is
good
tempered
,
and
that
is
all
.
<EOS>
My
only
scruple
in
advising
the
match
was
on
his
account
,
as
being
beneath
his
deserts
,
and
a
bad
connexion
for
him
.
<EOS>
I
felt
that
,
as
to
fortune
,
in
all
probability
he
might
do
much
better
;
and
that
as
to
a
rational
companion
or
useful
helpmate
,
he
could
not
do
worse
.
<EOS>
But
I
could
not
reason
so
to
a
man
in
love
,
and
was
willing
to
trust
to
there
being
no
harm
in
her
,
to
her
having
that
sort
of
disposition
,
which
,
in
good
hands
,
like
his
,
might
be
easily
led
aright
and
turn
out
very
well
.
<EOS>
The
advantage
of
the
match
<EOS>
I
felt
to
be
all
on
her
side
;
and
had
not
the
smallest
doubt
(
nor
have
I
now
)
that
there
would
be
a
general
cry
-
out
upon
her
extreme
good
luck
.
<EOS>
Even
_
<EOS>
your
_
satisfaction
I
made
sure
of
.
<EOS>
It
crossed
my
mind
immediately
that
you
would
not
regret
your
friend
's
leaving
Highbury
,
for
the
sake
of
her
being
settled
so
well
.
<EOS>
I
remember
saying
to
myself
,
"
Even
Emma
,
with
all
her
partiality
for
Harriet
,
will
think
this
a
good
match
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
can
not
help
wondering
at
your
knowing
so
little
of
Emma
as
to
say
any
such
thing
.
<EOS>
What
!
<EOS>
think
a
farmer
,
(
and
with
all
his
sense
and
all
his
merit
Mr.
Martin
is
nothing
more
,
)
a
good
match
for
my
intimate
friend
!
<EOS>
Not
regret
her
leaving
Highbury
for
the
sake
of
marrying
a
man
whom
I
could
never
admit
as
an
acquaintance
of
my
own
!
<EOS>
I
wonder
you
should
think
it
possible
for
me
to
have
such
feelings
.
<EOS>
I
assure
you
mine
are
very
different
.
<EOS>
I
must
think
your
statement
by
no
means
fair
.
<EOS>
You
are
not
just
to
Harriet
's
claims
.
<EOS>
They
would
be
estimated
very
differently
by
others
as
well
as
myself
;
Mr.
Martin
may
be
the
richest
of
the
two
,
but
he
is
undoubtedly
her
inferior
as
to
rank
in
society
.
 
<EOS>
The
sphere
in
which
she
moves
is
much
above
his
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
be
a
degradation
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
degradation
to
illegitimacy
and
ignorance
,
to
be
married
to
a
respectable
,
intelligent
gentleman
-
farmer
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
As
to
the
circumstances
of
her
birth
,
though
in
a
legal
sense
she
may
be
called
Nobody
,
it
will
not
hold
in
common
sense
.
<EOS>
She
is
not
to
pay
for
the
offence
of
others
,
by
being
held
below
the
level
of
those
with
whom
she
is
brought
up
.
 
<EOS>
There
can
scarcely
be
a
doubt
that
her
father
is
a
gentleman
 
and
a
gentleman
of
fortune
.
 
<EOS>
Her
allowance
is
very
liberal
;
nothing
has
ever
been
grudged
for
her
improvement
or
comfort
.
 
<EOS>
That
she
is
a
gentleman
's
daughter
,
is
indubitable
to
me
;
that
she
associates
with
gentlemen
's
daughters
,
no
one
,
I
apprehend
,
will
deny
.
 
<EOS>
She
is
superior
to
Mr.
Robert
Martin
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Whoever
might
be
her
parents
,
"
said
Mr.
Knightley
,
"
whoever
may
have
had
the
charge
of
her
,
it
does
not
appear
to
have
been
any
part
of
their
plan
to
introduce
her
into
what
you
would
call
good
society
.
<EOS>
After
receiving
a
very
indifferent
education
she
is
left
in
Mrs.
Goddard
's
hands
to
shift
as
she
can
;
 
to
move
,
in
short
,
in
Mrs.
Goddard
's
line
,
to
have
Mrs.
Goddard
's
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
Her
friends
evidently
thought
this
good
enough
for
her
;
and
it
_
was
_
good
enough
.
<EOS>
She
desired
nothing
better
herself
.
<EOS>
Till
you
chose
to
turn
her
into
a
friend
,
her
mind
had
no
distaste
for
her
own
set
,
nor
any
ambition
beyond
it
.
<EOS>
She
was
as
happy
as
possible
with
the
Martins
in
the
summer
.
<EOS>
She
had
no
sense
of
superiority
then
.
<EOS>
If
she
has
it
now
,
you
have
given
it
.
<EOS>
You
have
been
no
friend
to
Harriet
Smith
,
Emma
.
<EOS>
Robert
Martin
would
never
have
proceeded
so
far
,
if
he
had
not
felt
persuaded
of
her
not
being
disinclined
to
him
.
<EOS>
I
know
him
well
.
<EOS>
He
has
too
much
real
feeling
to
address
any
woman
on
the
haphazard
of
selfish
passion
.
<EOS>
And
as
to
conceit
,
he
is
the
farthest
from
it
of
any
man
I
know
.
<EOS>
Depend
upon
it
he
had
encouragement
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
most
convenient
to
Emma
not
to
make
a
direct
reply
to
this
assertion
;
she
chose
rather
to
take
up
her
own
line
of
the
subject
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
a
very
warm
friend
to
Mr.
Martin
;
but
,
as
I
said
before
,
are
unjust
to
Harriet
.
<EOS>
Harriet
's
claims
to
marry
well
are
not
so
contemptible
as
you
represent
them
.
<EOS>
She
is
not
a
clever
girl
,
but
she
has
better
sense
than
you
are
aware
of
,
and
does
not
deserve
to
have
her
understanding
spoken
of
so
slightingly
.
<EOS>
Waiving
that
point
,
however
,
and
supposing
her
to
be
,
as
you
describe
her
,
only
pretty
and
good
-
natured
,
let
me
tell
you
,
that
in
the
degree
she
possesses
them
,
they
are
not
trivial
recommendations
to
the
world
in
general
,
for
she
is
,
in
fact
,
a
beautiful
girl
,
and
must
be
thought
so
by
ninety
-
nine
people
out
of
an
hundred
;
and
till
it
appears
that
men
are
much
more
philosophic
on
the
subject
of
beauty
than
they
are
generally
supposed
;
till
they
do
fall
in
love
with
well
-
informed
minds
instead
of
handsome
faces
,
a
girl
,
with
such
loveliness
as
Harriet
,
has
a
certainty
of
being
admired
and
sought
after
,
of
having
the
power
of
chusing
from
among
many
,
consequently
a
claim
to
be
nice
.
<EOS>
Her
good
-
nature
,
too
,
is
not
so
very
slight
a
claim
,
comprehending
,
as
it
does
,
real
,
thorough
sweetness
of
temper
and
manner
,
a
very
humble
opinion
of
herself
,
and
a
great
readiness
to
be
pleased
with
other
people
.
<EOS>
I
am
very
much
mistaken
<EOS>
if
your
sex
in
general
would
not
think
such
beauty
,
and
such
temper
,
the
highest
claims
a
woman
could
possess
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
word
,
Emma
,
to
hear
you
abusing
the
reason
you
have
,
is
almost
enough
to
make
me
think
so
too
.
<EOS>
Better
be
without
sense
,
than
misapply
it
as
you
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
To
be
sure
!
<EOS>
"
cried
she
playfully
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
_
that
_
is
the
feeling
of
you
all
.
<EOS>
I
know
that
such
a
girl
as
Harriet
is
exactly
what
every
man
delights
in
 
what
at
once
bewitches
his
senses
and
satisfies
his
judgment
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
Harriet
may
pick
and
chuse
.
<EOS>
Were
you
,
yourself
,
ever
to
marry
,
she
is
the
very
woman
for
you
.
<EOS>
And
is
she
,
at
seventeen
,
just
entering
into
life
,
just
beginning
to
be
known
,
to
be
wondered
at
because
she
does
not
accept
the
first
offer
she
receives
?
<EOS>
No
 
pray
let
her
have
time
to
look
about
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
always
thought
it
a
very
foolish
intimacy
,
"
said
Mr.
Knightley
presently
,
"
though
I
have
kept
my
thoughts
to
myself
;
but
I
now
perceive
that
it
will
be
a
very
unfortunate
one
for
Harriet
.
<EOS>
You
will
puff
her
up
with
such
ideas
of
her
own
beauty
,
and
of
what
she
has
a
claim
to
,
that
,
in
a
little
while
,
nobody
within
her
reach
will
be
good
enough
for
her
.
<EOS>
Vanity
working
on
a
weak
head
,
produces
every
sort
of
mischief
.
<EOS>
Nothing
so
easy
as
for
a
young
lady
to
raise
her
expectations
too
high
.
<EOS>
Miss
Harriet
Smith
may
not
find
offers
of
marriage
flow
in
so
fast
,
though
she
is
a
very
pretty
girl
.
<EOS>
Men
of
sense
,
whatever
you
may
chuse
to
say
,
do
not
want
silly
wives
.
<EOS>
Men
of
family
would
not
be
very
fond
of
connecting
themselves
with
a
girl
of
such
obscurity
 
and
most
prudent
men
would
be
afraid
of
the
inconvenience
and
disgrace
<EOS>
they
might
be
involved
in
,
when
the
mystery
of
her
parentage
came
to
be
revealed
.
<EOS>
Let
her
marry
Robert
Martin
,
and
she
is
safe
,
respectable
,
and
happy
for
ever
;
but
if
you
encourage
her
to
expect
to
marry
greatly
,
and
teach
her
to
be
satisfied
with
nothing
less
than
a
man
of
consequence
and
large
fortune
,
she
may
be
a
parlour
-
boarder
at
Mrs.
Goddard
's
all
the
rest
of
her
life
 
or
,
at
least
,
(
for
Harriet
Smith
is
a
girl
who
will
marry
somebody
or
other
,
)
till
she
grow
desperate
,
and
is
glad
to
catch
at
the
old
writing
-
master
's
son
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
think
so
very
differently
on
this
point
,
Mr.
Knightley
,
that
there
can
be
no
use
in
canvassing
it
.
<EOS>
We
shall
only
be
making
each
other
more
angry
.
<EOS>
But
as
to
my
_
letting
_
her
marry
Robert
Martin
,
it
is
impossible
;
she
has
refused
him
,
and
so
decidedly
,
I
think
,
as
must
prevent
any
second
application
.
<EOS>
She
must
abide
by
the
evil
of
having
refused
him
,
whatever
it
may
be
;
and
as
to
the
refusal
itself
,
I
will
not
pretend
to
say
that
I
might
not
influence
her
a
little
;
but
I
assure
you
there
was
very
little
for
me
or
for
any
body
to
do
.
<EOS>
His
appearance
is
so
much
against
him
,
and
his
manner
so
bad
,
that
if
she
ever
were
disposed
to
favour
him
,
she
is
not
now
.
<EOS>
I
can
imagine
,
that
before
she
had
seen
any
body
superior
,
she
might
tolerate
him
.
<EOS>
He
was
the
brother
of
her
friends
,
and
he
took
pains
to
please
her
;
and
altogether
,
having
seen
nobody
better
(
that
must
have
been
his
great
assistant
)
<EOS>
she
might
not
,
while
she
was
at
Abbey
-
Mill
,
find
him
disagreeable
.
<EOS>
But
the
case
is
altered
now
.
<EOS>
She
knows
now
what
gentlemen
are
;
and
nothing
but
a
gentleman
in
education
and
manner
has
any
chance
with
Harriet
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nonsense
,
errant
nonsense
,
as
ever
was
talked
!
"
cried
Mr.
Knightley
.
 
<EOS>
"
Robert
Martin
's
manners
have
sense
,
sincerity
,
and
good
-
humour
to
recommend
them
;
and
his
mind
has
more
true
gentility
than
Harriet
Smith
could
understand
.
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
made
no
answer
,
and
tried
to
look
cheerfully
unconcerned
,
but
was
really
feeling
uncomfortable
and
wanting
him
very
much
to
be
gone
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
repent
what
she
had
done
;
she
still
thought
herself
a
better
judge
of
such
a
point
of
female
right
and
refinement
than
he
could
be
;
but
yet
she
had
a
sort
of
habitual
respect
for
his
judgment
in
general
,
which
made
her
dislike
having
it
so
loudly
against
her
;
and
to
have
him
sitting
just
opposite
to
her
in
angry
state
,
was
very
disagreeable
.
<EOS>
Some
minutes
passed
in
this
unpleasant
silence
,
with
only
one
attempt
on
Emma
's
side
to
talk
of
the
weather
,
but
he
made
no
answer
.
<EOS>
He
was
thinking
.
<EOS>
The
result
of
his
thoughts
appeared
at
last
in
these
words
.
  
<EOS>
"
Robert
Martin
has
no
great
loss
 
if
he
can
but
think
so
;
and
I
hope
it
will
not
be
long
before
he
does
.
<EOS>
Your
views
for
Harriet
are
best
known
to
yourself
;
but
as
you
make
no
secret
of
your
love
of
match
-
making
,
it
is
fair
to
suppose
that
views
,
and
plans
,
and
projects
you
have
;
 
and
as
a
friend
I
shall
just
hint
to
you
that
if
Elton
is
the
man
,
I
think
it
will
be
all
labour
in
vain
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
laughed
and
disclaimed
.
<EOS>
He
continued
,
  
<EOS>
"
Depend
upon
it
,
Elton
will
not
do
.
<EOS>
Elton
is
a
very
good
sort
of
man
,
and
a
very
respectable
vicar
of
Highbury
,
but
not
at
all
likely
to
make
an
imprudent
match
.
<EOS>
He
knows
the
value
of
a
good
income
as
well
as
any
body
.
<EOS>
Elton
may
talk
sentimentally
,
but
he
will
act
rationally
.
<EOS>
He
is
as
well
acquainted
with
his
own
claims
,
as
you
can
be
with
Harriet
's
.
<EOS>
He
knows
that
he
is
a
very
handsome
young
man
,
and
a
great
favourite
wherever
he
goes
;
and
from
his
general
way
of
talking
in
unreserved
moments
,
when
there
are
only
men
present
,
I
am
convinced
that
he
does
not
mean
to
throw
himself
away
.
<EOS>
I
have
heard
him
speak
with
great
animation
of
a
large
family
of
young
ladies
that
his
sisters
are
intimate
with
,
who
have
all
twenty
thousand
pounds
apiece
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
,
"
said
Emma
,
laughing
again
.
<EOS>
"
If
I
had
set
my
heart
on
Mr.
Elton
's
marrying
Harriet
,
it
would
have
been
very
kind
to
open
my
eyes
;
but
at
present
I
only
want
to
keep
Harriet
to
myself
.
<EOS>
I
have
done
with
match
-
making
indeed
.
<EOS>
I
could
never
hope
to
equal
my
own
doings
at
Randalls
.
<EOS>
I
shall
leave
off
while
I
am
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Good
morning
to
you
,
"
 
said
he
,
rising
and
walking
off
abruptly
.
<EOS>
He
was
very
much
vexed
.
<EOS>
He
felt
the
disappointment
of
the
young
man
,
and
was
mortified
to
have
been
the
means
of
promoting
it
,
by
the
sanction
he
had
given
;
and
the
part
which
he
was
persuaded
Emma
had
taken
in
the
affair
,
was
provoking
him
exceedingly
.
  
<EOS>
Emma
remained
in
a
state
of
vexation
too
;
but
there
was
more
indistinctness
in
the
causes
of
her
's
,
than
in
his
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
always
feel
so
absolutely
satisfied
with
herself
,
so
entirely
convinced
that
her
opinions
were
right
and
her
adversary
's
wrong
,
as
Mr.
Knightley
.
<EOS>
He
walked
off
in
more
complete
self
-
approbation
than
he
left
for
her
.
<EOS>
She
was
not
so
materially
cast
down
,
however
,
but
that
a
little
time
and
the
return
of
Harriet
were
very
adequate
restoratives
.
<EOS>
Harriet
's
staying
away
so
long
was
beginning
to
make
her
uneasy
.
<EOS>
The
possibility
of
the
young
man
's
coming
to
Mrs.
Goddard
's
that
morning
,
and
meeting
with
Harriet
and
pleading
his
own
cause
,
gave
alarming
ideas
.
<EOS>
The
dread
of
such
a
failure
after
all
became
the
prominent
uneasiness
;
and
when
Harriet
appeared
,
and
in
very
good
spirits
,
and
without
having
any
such
reason
to
give
for
her
long
absence
<EOS>
,
she
felt
a
satisfaction
which
settled
her
with
her
own
mind
,
and
convinced
her
,
that
let
Mr.
Knightley
think
or
say
what
he
would
,
she
had
done
nothing
which
woman
's
friendship
and
woman
's
feelings
would
not
justify
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
frightened
her
a
little
about
Mr.
Elton
;
but
when
she
considered
that
Mr.
Knightley
could
not
have
observed
him
as
she
had
done
,
neither
with
the
interest
,
nor
(
she
must
be
allowed
to
tell
herself
,
in
spite
of
Mr.
Knightley
's
pretensions
)
with
the
skill
of
such
an
observer
on
such
a
question
as
herself
,
that
he
had
spoken
it
hastily
and
in
anger
,
she
was
able
to
believe
,
that
he
had
rather
said
what
he
wished
resentfully
to
be
true
,
than
what
he
knew
any
thing
about
.
<EOS>
He
certainly
might
have
heard
Mr.
Elton
speak
with
more
unreserve
than
she
had
ever
done
,
and
Mr.
Elton
might
not
be
of
an
imprudent
,
inconsiderate
disposition
as
to
money
matters
;
he
might
naturally
be
rather
attentive
than
otherwise
to
them
;
but
then
,
Mr.
Knightley
did
not
make
due
allowance
for
the
influence
of
a
strong
passion
at
war
with
all
interested
motives
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Knightley
saw
no
such
passion
,
and
of
course
thought
nothing
of
its
effects
;
but
she
saw
too
much
of
it
to
feel
a
doubt
of
its
overcoming
any
hesitations
that
a
reasonable
prudence
might
originally
suggest
;
and
more
than
a
reasonable
,
becoming
degree
of
prudence
,
she
was
very
sure
did
not
belong
to
Mr.
Elton
.
  
<EOS>
Harriet
's
cheerful
look
and
manner
established
hers
<EOS>
:
she
came
back
,
not
to
think
of
Mr.
Martin
,
but
to
talk
of
Mr.
Elton
.
<EOS>
Miss
Nash
had
been
telling
her
something
,
which
she
repeated
immediately
with
great
delight
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Perry
had
been
to
Mrs.
Goddard
's
to
attend
a
sick
child
,
and
Miss
Nash
had
seen
him
,
and
he
had
told
Miss
Nash
,
that
as
he
was
coming
back
yesterday
from
Clayton
Park
,
he
had
met
Mr.
Elton
,
and
found
to
his
great
surprize
,
that
Mr.
Elton
was
actually
on
his
road
to
London
,
and
not
meaning
to
return
till
the
morrow
,
though
it
was
the
whist
-
club
night
,
which
he
had
been
never
known
to
miss
before
;
and
Mr.
Perry
had
remonstrated
with
him
about
it
,
and
told
him
how
shabby
it
was
in
him
,
their
best
player
,
to
absent
himself
,
and
tried
very
much
to
persuade
him
to
put
off
his
journey
only
one
day
;
but
it
would
not
do
;
Mr.
Elton
had
been
determined
to
go
on
,
and
had
said
in
a
_
<EOS>
very
_
_
particular
_
way
indeed
,
that
he
was
going
on
business
which
he
would
not
put
off
for
any
inducement
in
the
world
;
and
something
about
a
very
enviable
commission
,
and
being
the
bearer
of
something
exceedingly
precious
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Perry
could
not
quite
understand
him
,
but
he
was
very
sure
there
must
be
a
_
lady
_
in
the
case
,
and
he
told
him
so
;
and
Mr.
Elton
only
looked
very
conscious
and
smiling
,
and
rode
off
in
great
spirits
.
<EOS>
Miss
Nash
had
told
her
all
this
,
and
had
talked
a
great
deal
more
about
Mr.
Elton
;
and
said
,
looking
so
very
significantly
at
her
,
"
that
she
did
not
pretend
to
understand
what
his
business
might
be
,
but
she
only
knew
that
any
woman
whom
Mr.
Elton
could
prefer
,
she
should
think
the
luckiest
woman
in
the
world
;
for
,
beyond
a
doubt
,
Mr.
Elton
had
not
his
equal
for
beauty
or
agreeableness
.
"
    
<EOS>
Mr.
Knightley
might
quarrel
with
her
,
but
Emma
could
not
quarrel
with
herself
.
<EOS>
He
was
so
much
displeased
,
that
it
was
longer
than
usual
before
he
came
to
Hartfield
again
;
and
when
they
did
meet
,
his
grave
looks
shewed
that
she
was
not
forgiven
.
<EOS>
She
was
sorry
,
but
could
not
repent
.
<EOS>
On
the
contrary
,
her
plans
and
proceedings
were
more
and
more
justified
and
endeared
to
her
by
the
general
appearances
of
the
next
few
days
.
  
<EOS>
The
Picture
,
elegantly
framed
,
came
safely
to
hand
soon
after
Mr.
Elton
's
return
,
and
being
hung
over
the
mantelpiece
of
the
common
sitting
-
room
,
he
got
up
to
look
at
it
,
and
sighed
out
his
half
sentences
of
admiration
just
as
he
ought
;
and
as
for
Harriet
's
feelings
,
they
were
visibly
forming
themselves
into
as
strong
and
steady
an
attachment
as
her
youth
and
sort
of
mind
admitted
.
<EOS>
Emma
was
soon
perfectly
satisfied
of
Mr.
Martin
's
being
no
otherwise
remembered
,
than
as
he
furnished
a
contrast
with
Mr.
Elton
,
of
the
utmost
advantage
to
the
latter
.
  
<EOS>
Her
views
of
improving
her
little
friend
's
mind
,
by
a
great
deal
of
useful
reading
and
conversation
,
had
never
yet
led
to
more
than
a
few
first
chapters
,
and
the
intention
of
going
on
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
It
was
much
easier
to
chat
than
to
study
;
much
pleasanter
to
let
her
imagination
range
and
work
at
Harriet
's
fortune
,
than
to
be
labouring
to
enlarge
her
comprehension
or
exercise
it
on
sober
facts
;
and
the
only
literary
pursuit
which
engaged
Harriet
at
present
,
the
only
mental
provision
she
was
making
for
the
evening
of
life
,
was
the
collecting
and
transcribing
all
the
riddles
of
every
sort
that
she
could
meet
with
,
into
a
thin
quarto
of
hot
-
pressed
paper
,
made
up
by
her
friend
,
and
ornamented
with
ciphers
and
trophies
.
  
<EOS>
In
this
age
of
literature
,
such
collections
on
a
very
grand
scale
are
not
uncommon
.
<EOS>
Miss
Nash
,
head
-
teacher
at
Mrs.
Goddard
's
,
had
written
out
at
least
three
hundred
;
and
Harriet
,
who
had
taken
the
first
hint
of
it
from
her
,
hoped
,
with
Miss
Woodhouse
's
help
,
to
get
a
great
many
more
.
<EOS>
Emma
assisted
with
her
invention
,
memory
and
taste
;
and
as
Harriet
wrote
a
very
pretty
hand
,
it
was
likely
to
be
an
arrangement
of
the
first
order
,
in
form
as
well
as
quantity
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Woodhouse
was
almost
as
much
interested
in
the
business
as
the
girls
,
and
tried
very
often
to
recollect
something
worth
their
putting
in
.
"
<EOS>
So
many
clever
riddles
as
there
used
to
be
when
he
was
young
 
<EOS>
he
wondered
he
could
not
remember
them
!
<EOS>
but
he
hoped
he
should
in
time
.
"
<EOS>
And
it
always
ended
in
"
Kitty
,
a
fair
but
frozen
maid
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
His
good
friend
Perry
,
too
,
whom
he
had
spoken
to
on
the
subject
,
did
not
at
present
recollect
any
thing
of
the
riddle
kind
;
but
he
had
desired
Perry
to
be
upon
the
watch
,
and
as
he
went
about
so
much
,
something
<EOS>
,
he
thought
,
might
come
from
that
quarter
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
by
no
means
his
daughter
's
wish
that
the
intellects
of
Highbury
in
general
should
be
put
under
requisition
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Elton
was
the
only
one
whose
assistance
she
asked
.
<EOS>
He
was
invited
to
contribute
any
really
good
enigmas
,
charades
,
or
conundrums
that
he
might
recollect
;
and
she
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
him
most
intently
at
work
with
his
recollections
;
and
at
the
same
time
,
as
she
could
perceive
,
most
earnestly
careful
that
nothing
ungallant
,
nothing
that
did
not
breathe
a
compliment
to
the
sex
should
pass
his
lips
.
<EOS>
They
owed
to
him
their
two
or
three
politest
puzzles
;
and
the
joy
and
exultation
with
which
at
last
he
recalled
,
and
rather
sentimentally
recited
,
that
well
-
known
charade
,
  
My
first
doth
affliction
denote
,
Which
my
second
is
destin'd
to
feel
<EOS>
And
my
whole
is
the
best
antidote
<EOS>
That
affliction
to
soften
and
heal
.
    
<EOS>
made
her
quite
sorry
to
acknowledge
that
they
had
transcribed
it
some
pages
ago
already
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
will
not
you
write
one
yourself
for
us
,
Mr.
Elton
?
<EOS>
"
said
she
;
"
that
is
the
only
security
for
its
freshness
;
and
nothing
could
be
easier
to
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
no
!
<EOS>
he
had
never
written
,
hardly
ever
,
any
thing
of
the
kind
in
his
life
.
<EOS>
The
stupidest
fellow
!
<EOS>
He
was
afraid
not
even
Miss
Woodhouse
"
 
<EOS>
he
stopt
a
moment
 
"
or
Miss
Smith
could
inspire
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
very
next
day
however
produced
some
proof
of
inspiration
.
<EOS>
He
called
for
a
few
moments
,
just
to
leave
a
piece
of
paper
on
the
table
containing
,
as
he
said
,
a
charade
,
which
a
friend
of
his
had
addressed
to
a
young
lady
,
the
object
of
his
admiration
,
but
which
,
from
his
manner
,
Emma
was
immediately
convinced
must
be
his
own

"
I
do
not
offer
it
for
Miss
Smith
's
collection
,
"
said
he
.
<EOS>
"
Being
my
friend
's
,
I
have
no
right
to
expose
it
in
any
degree
to
the
public
eye
,
but
perhaps
you
may
not
dislike
looking
at
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
speech
was
more
to
Emma
than
to
Harriet
,
which
Emma
could
understand
.
<EOS>
There
was
deep
consciousness
about
him
,
and
he
found
it
easier
to
meet
her
eye
than
her
friend
's
.
<EOS>
He
was
gone
the
next
moment
:
 
after
another
moment
's
pause
,
  
<EOS>
"
Take
it
,
"
said
Emma
,
smiling
,
and
pushing
the
paper
towards
Harriet
 
<EOS>
"
it
is
for
you
.
<EOS>
Take
your
own
.
"
  
<EOS>
But
Harriet
was
in
a
tremor
,
and
could
not
touch
it
;
and
Emma
,
never
loth
to
be
first
,
was
obliged
to
examine
it
herself
.

She
cast
her
eye
over
it
,
pondered
,
caught
the
meaning
,
read
it
through
again
to
be
quite
certain
,
and
quite
mistress
of
the
lines

and
then
passing
it
to
Harriet
,
sat
happily
smiling
,
and
saying
to
herself
,
while
Harriet
was
puzzling
over
the
paper
in
all
the
confusion
of
hope
and
dulness
,
"
Very

Mr.

Harriet
exactly

<EOS>
Soft

the

that

All

<EOS>
A

must
be
very
much
in

indeed
,
to
describe
her
so
.
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
Mr.
Knightley
,
I
wish
you
had
the
benefit
of
this
;
I
think
this
would
convince
you
.
<EOS>
For
once
in
your
life
you
would
be
obliged
to
own
yourself
mistaken
.
<EOS>
An
excellent

and
very
much
to
the
purpose
.
<EOS>
Things
must
come
to
a
crisis
soon

"
  
<EOS>
She
was
obliged
to
break
off
from
these
very
pleasant
observations
,
which
were
otherwise
of
a
sort
to
run
into
great
length
,
by
the
eagerness

Harriet

wondering
questions

What

I
wonder
who
the

was
 
and
who
could
be
the
young
lady
.
<EOS>
Do
you
think
it
is
a
good
one
?
<EOS>
Can
it
be
woman
?
  
<EOS>
And
woman
,
lovely
woman
,
reigns
alone

Can
it
be
Neptune

Behold
him

Or

<EOS>
Oh

no

<EOS>

is
only
one
syllable

<EOS>
It
must
be
very
clever

he
would
not

brought
it

<EOS>
Oh

do
you
think

shall
ever
find

out

<EOS>
"
Mermaids

<EOS>
Nonsense

<EOS>
My
dear
Harriet

what
are
you
thinking

<EOS>
Where
would
be
the
use
of
his
bringing

then
follows
the
application

I
think

my
dear
Harriet

you
can
not
find
much
difficulty
in
comprehending
.
<EOS>
Read
it
in
comfort

There
can

no

of
its
being
written
for

"
  
<EOS>
Harriet
could
not
long
resist
so
delightful
a
persuasion
.
<EOS>
She
read
the
concluding
lines
,
and
was
all
flutter
and
happiness
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
speak
.
<EOS>
But
she
was
not
wanted
to
speak
.
<EOS>
It
was
enough
for
her
to
feel
.
<EOS>
Emma
spoke
for
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
so
pointed
,
and
so
particular
a
meaning
in
this
compliment
,
"
said
she
,
"
that
I
can
not
have
a
doubt
as
to
Mr.
Elton
's
intentions
.
<EOS>
You
are
his
object
 
and
you
will
soon
receive
the
completest
proof
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
thought
it
must
be
so
.
<EOS>
I
thought
I
could
not
be
so
deceived
;
but
now
,
it
is
clear
;
the
state
of
his
mind
is
as
clear
and
decided
,
<EOS>
as
my
wishes
on
the
subject
have
been
ever
since
I
knew
you
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
Harriet
,
just
so
long
have
I
been
wanting
the
very
circumstance
to
happen
what
has
happened
.
<EOS>
I
could
never
tell
whether
an
attachment
between
you
and
Mr.
Elton
were
most
desirable
or
most
natural
.
<EOS>
Its
probability
and
its
eligibility
have
really
so
equalled
each
other
!
<EOS>
I
am
very
happy
.
<EOS>
I
congratulate
you
,
my
dear
Harriet
,
with
all
my
heart
.
<EOS>
This
is
an
attachment
which
a
woman
may
well
feel
pride
in
creating
.
<EOS>
This
is
a
connexion
which
offers
nothing
but
good
.
<EOS>
It
will
give
you
every
thing
that
you
want
 
consideration
,
independence
,
a
proper
home
 
it
will
fix
you
in
the
centre
of
all
your
real
friends
,
close
to
Hartfield
and
to
me
,
and
confirm
our
intimacy
for
ever
.
<EOS>
This
,
Harriet
,
is
an
alliance
which
can
never
raise
a
blush
in
either
of
us
.

<EOS>
"
Dear
Miss
Woodhouse

"
 
<EOS>
and
"
Dear
Miss
Woodhouse
,
"
was
all
that
Harriet
,
with
many
tender
embraces
could
articulate
at
first
;
but
when
they
did
arrive
at
something
more
like
conversation
,
it
was
sufficiently
clear
to
her
friend
that
she
saw
,
felt
,
anticipated
,
and
remembered
just
as
she
ought
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Elton
's
superiority
had
very
ample
acknowledgment
.
  
<EOS>
"
Whatever
you
say
is
always
right
,
"
cried
Harriet
,
"
and
therefore
I
suppose
,
and
believe
,
and
hope
it
must
be
so
;
but
otherwise
I
could
not
have
imagined
it
.
<EOS>
It
is
so
much
beyond
any
thing
I
deserve
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Elton
,
who
might
marry
any
body
!
<EOS>
There
can
not
be
two
opinions
about
_
him
<EOS>
_
.
<EOS>
He
is
so
very
superior
.
<EOS>
Only
think
of
those
sweet
verses
 
"
To
Miss
.
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
,
how
clever
!
 
<EOS>
Could
it
really
be
meant
for
me
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
make
a
question
,
or
listen
to
a
question
about
that
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
certainty
.
<EOS>
Receive
it
on
my
judgment
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
sort
of
prologue
to
the
play
,
a
motto
to
the
chapter
;
and
will
be
soon
followed
by
matter
-
of
-
fact
prose
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
sort
of
thing
which
nobody
could
have
expected
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
,
a
month
ago
,
I
had
no
more
idea
myself
!
 
<EOS>
The
strangest
things
do
take
place
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
When
Miss
Smiths
and
Mr.
Eltons
get
acquainted
 
they
do
indeed
 
and
really
it
is
strange
;
it
is
out
of
the
common
course
that
what
is
so
evidently
,
so
palpably
desirable
 
<EOS>
what
courts
the
pre
-
arrangement
of
other
people
,
should
so
immediately
shape
itself
into
the
proper
form
.
<EOS>
You
and
Mr.
Elton
are
by
situation
called
together
;
you
belong
to
one
another
by
every
circumstance
of
your
respective
homes
.
<EOS>
Your
marrying
will
be
equal
to
the
match
at
Randalls
.
<EOS>
There
does
seem
to
be
a
something
in
the
air
of
Hartfield
which
gives
love
exactly
the
right
direction
,
and
sends
it
into
the
very
channel
where
it
ought
to
flow
.
  
<EOS>
The
course
of
true
love
never
did
run
smooth
    
A
Hartfield
edition
of
Shakespeare
would
have
a
long
note
on
that
passage

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
Mr.
Elton
should
really
be
in
love
with
me
,
 
me
,
of
all
people
,
who
did
not
know
him
,
to
speak
to
him
,
at
Michaelmas
!
<EOS>
And
he
,
the
very
handsomest
man
that
ever
was
,
and
a
man
that
every
body
looks
up
to
,
quite
like
Mr.
Knightley
!
<EOS>
His
company
so
sought
after
,
that
every
body
says
he
need
not
eat
a
single
meal
by
himself
if
he
does
not
chuse
it
;
that
he
has
more
invitations
than
there
are
days
in
the
week
.
<EOS>
And
so
excellent
in
the
Church
!
<EOS>
Miss
Nash
has
put
down
all
the
texts
he
has
ever
preached
from
since
he
came
to
Highbury
.
<EOS>
Dear
me
!
<EOS>
When
I
look
back
to
the
first
time
I
saw
him
!
<EOS>
How
little
did
I
think
!
 
<EOS>
The
two
Abbots
and
I
ran
into
the
front
room
and
peeped
through
the
blind
when
we
heard
he
was
going
by
,
and
Miss
Nash
came
and
scolded
us
away
,
and
staid
to
look
through
herself
;
however
,
she
called
me
back
presently
,
and
let
me
look
too
,
which
was
very
good
-
natured
.
<EOS>
And
how
beautiful
we
thought
he
looked
!
<EOS>
He
was
arm
-
in
-
arm
with
Mr.
Cole
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
This
is
an
alliance
which
,
whoever
 
whatever
your
friends
may
be
,
must
be
agreeable
to
them
,
provided
at
least
they
have
common
sense
;
and
we
are
not
to
be
addressing
our
conduct
to
fools
.
<EOS>
If
they
are
anxious
to
see
you
<EOS>
_
happily
<EOS>
_
married
,
here
is
a
man
whose
amiable
character
gives
every
assurance

they
wish
to
have
you
settled
in
the
same
country
and
circle
which
they
have
chosen
to
place
you
in
,
here
it
will
be
accomplished

their
only
object
is
that
you
should

in
the
common
phrase

be
_
<EOS>
well
_
married

here
is
the
comfortable
fortune

the
respectable
establishment

the
rise

must
satisfy
them

talk

This
charade
!

studied
a
twelvemonth
,

could
never
have
made

do
not
consider
its
length

can
not

too
short

<EOS>
Harriet
was
too
intent
on
the
lines
to
hear
.
<EOS>
The
most
satisfactory
comparisons
were
rising
in
her
mind

<EOS>
"
It
is
one
thing
,
"
said
she
,
presently
 
her
cheeks
in
a
glow
 
"
to
have
very
good
sense
in
a
common
way
,
like
every
body
else
,
and
if
there
is
any
thing
to
say
,
to
sit
down
and
write
a
letter
,
and
say
just
what
you
must
,
in
a
short
way
;
and
another
,
to
write
verses
and
charades
like
this
.
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
could
not
have
desired
a
more
spirited
rejection
of
Mr.
Martin

prose

Such
sweet
lines

<EOS>
continued
Harriet
 
<EOS>

these
two
last

shall
I

able

return
the
paper

out

do
nothing

will
be
here
this
evening

I
dare
say
,

then
I
will
give
it
him
back

some
nonsense
or
other
will
pass
between
us
,
and
you
shall
not
be
committed
.
 
<EOS>
Your
soft
eyes
shall
chuse
their
own
time
for
beaming
.
<EOS>
Trust
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
<EOS>
Miss
Woodhouse
,
what
a
pity
that
I
must
not
write
this
beautiful
charade
into
my
book
!
<EOS>
I
am
sure
I
have
not
got
one
half
so
good
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Leave
out
the
two
last
lines
,
and
there
is
no
reason
why
you
should
not
write
it
into
your
book
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
but
those
two
lines
are
"
      
"
The
best
of
all
.
<EOS>
Granted
;
 
for
private
enjoyment
;
and
for
private
enjoyment
keep
them
.
<EOS>
They
are
not
at
all
the
less
written
you
know
,
because
you
divide
them
.
<EOS>
The
couplet
does
not
cease
to
be
,
nor
does
its
meaning
change
.
<EOS>
But
take
it
away
,
and
all
_
appropriation
_
ceases
,
and
a
very
pretty
gallant
charade
remains
,
fit
for
any
collection
.
<EOS>
Depend
upon
it
,
he
would
not
like
to
have
his
charade
slighted
,
much
better
than
his
passion
.
<EOS>
A
poet
in
love
must
be
encouraged
in
both
capacities
,
or
neither
.
<EOS>
Give
me
the
book
,
I
will
write
it
down
,
and
then
there
can
be
no
possible
reflection
on
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Harriet
submitted
,
though
her
mind
could
hardly
separate
the
parts
,
so
as
to
feel
quite
sure
that
her
friend
were
not
writing
down
a
declaration
of
love
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
too
precious
an
offering
for
any
degree
of
publicity
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
never
let
that
book
go
out
of
my
own
hands
,
"
said
she
.
  
<EOS>
"
Very
well
,
"
replied
Emma
;
"
a
most
natural
feeling
;
and
the
longer
it
lasts
,
the
better
I
shall
be
pleased
.
<EOS>
But
here
is
my
father
coming
:
<EOS>
you
will
not
object
to
my
reading
the
charade
to
him
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
giving
him
so
much
pleasure
!
<EOS>
He
loves
any
thing
of
the
sort
,
and
especially
any
thing
that
pays
woman
a
compliment
.
<EOS>
He
has
the
tenderest
spirit
of
gallantry
towards
us
all
!
 
<EOS>
You
must
let
me
read
it
to
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
Harriet
looked
grave
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Harriet
,
you
must
not
refine
too
much
upon
this
charade
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
betray
your
feelings
improperly
,
if
you
are
too
conscious
and
too
quick
,
and
appear
to
affix
more
meaning
,
or
even
quite
all
the
meaning
which
may
be
affixed
to
it
.
<EOS>
Do
not
be
overpowered
by
such
a
little
tribute
of
admiration
.
<EOS>
If
he
had
been
anxious
for
secrecy
,
he
would
not
have
left
the
paper
while
I
was
by
;
but
he
rather
pushed
it
towards
me
than
towards
you
.
<EOS>
Do
not
let
us
be
too
solemn
on
the
business
.
<EOS>
He
has
encouragement
enough
to
proceed
,
without
our
sighing
out
our
souls
over
this
charade
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Oh
!
no
 
<EOS>
I
hope
I
shall
not
be
ridiculous
about
it
.
<EOS>
Do
as
you
please
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Woodhouse
came
in
,
and
very
soon
led
to
the
subject
again
,
by
the
recurrence
of
his
very
frequent
inquiry
of
"
Well
,
my
dears
,
how
does
your
book
go
on
?
 
<EOS>
Have
you
got
any
thing
fresh
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
papa
;
we
have
something
to
read
you
,
something
quite
fresh
.
<EOS>
A
piece
of
paper
was
found
on
the
table
this
morning
 
(
dropt
,
we
suppose
,
by
a
fairy
)
 
<EOS>
containing
a
very
pretty
charade
,
and
we
have
just
copied
it
in
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
read
it
to
him
,
just
as
he
liked
to
have
any
thing
read
,
slowly
and
distinctly
,
and
two
or
three
times
over
,
with
explanations
of
every
part
as
she
proceeded
 
and
he
was
very
much
pleased
,
and
,
as
she
had
foreseen
,
especially
struck
with
the
complimentary
conclusion
.
  
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
that
's
very
just
,
indeed
,
that
's
very
properly
said
.
<EOS>
Very
true
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Woman
,
lovely
woman
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
such
a
pretty
charade
,
my
dear
,
that
I
can
easily
guess
what
fairy
brought
it
.
 
<EOS>
Nobody
could
have
written
so
prettily
,
but
you
,
Emma
.
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
only
nodded
,
and
smiled
.
 
<EOS>
After
a
little
thinking
,
and
a
very
tender
sigh
,
he
added
,
  
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
it
is
no
difficulty
to
see
who
you
take
after
!
<EOS>
Your
dear
mother
was
so
clever
at
all
those
things
!
<EOS>
If
I
had
but
her
memory
!
<EOS>
But
I
can
remember
nothing
;
 
not
even
that
particular
riddle
which
you
have
heard
me
mention
;
I
can
only
recollect
the
first
stanza
;
and
there
are
several
.
  
<EOS>
Kitty
,
a
fair
but
frozen
maid
,
Kindled
a
flame
I
yet
deplore
,
The
hood
-
<EOS>
wink'd
boy
I
called
to
aid
,
Though
of
his
near
approach
afraid
,
So
fatal
to
my
suit
before
.
  
<EOS>
And
that
is
all
that
I
can
recollect
of
it
 
<EOS>
but
it
is
very
clever
all
the
way
through
.
<EOS>
But
I
think
,
my
dear
,
you
said
you
had
got
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Yes
,
papa
,
it
is
written
out
in
our
second
page
.
<EOS>
We
copied
it
from
the
Elegant
Extracts
.
<EOS>
It
was
Garrick
's
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
very
true
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
I
could
recollect
more
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
Kitty
,
a
fair
but
frozen
maid
.
  
<EOS>
The
name
makes
me
think
of
poor
Isabella
;
for
she
was
very
near
being
christened
Catherine
after
her
grandmama
.
<EOS>
I
hope
we
shall
have
her
here
next
week
.
<EOS>
Have
you
thought
,
my
dear
,
where
you
shall
put
her
 
and
what
room
there
will
be
for
the
children
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
yes
 
she
will
have
her
own
room
,
of
course
;
the
room
she
always
has
;
 
and
there
is
the
nursery
for
the
children
,
 
just
as
usual
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
Why
should
there
be
any
change
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
,
my
dear
 
<EOS>
but
it
is
so
long
since
she
was
here
!
 
<EOS>
not
since
last
Easter
,
and
then
only
for
a
few
days
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
John
Knightley
's
being
a
lawyer
is
very
inconvenient
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
Isabella
!
 
<EOS>
she
is
sadly
taken
away
from
us
all
!
 
<EOS>
and
how
sorry
she
will
be
<EOS>
when
she
comes
,
not
to
see
Miss
Taylor
here
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
will
not
be
surprized
,
papa
,
at
least
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
,
<EOS>
my
dear
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
I
was
very
much
surprized
when
I
first
heard
she
was
going
to
be
married
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
must
ask
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Weston
to
dine
with
us
,
while
Isabella
is
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
my
dear
,
if
there
is
time
.
 
<EOS>
But
 
(
in
a
very
depressed
tone
)
 
<EOS>
she
is
coming
for
only
one
week
.
<EOS>
There
will
not
be
time
for
any
thing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
unfortunate
that
they
can
not
stay
longer
 
<EOS>
but
it
seems
a
case
of
necessity
.
<EOS>
Mr.
John
Knightley
must
be
in
town
again
on
the
28th
,
and
we
ought
to
be
thankful
,
papa
,
that
we
are
to
have
the
whole
of
the
time
they
can
give
to
the
country
,
that
two
or
three
days
are
not
to
be
taken
out
for
the
Abbey
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Knightley
promises
to
give
up
his
claim
this
Christmas
 
though
you
know
it
is
longer
since
they
were
with
him
,
than
with
us
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
very
hard
,
indeed
,
<EOS>
my
dear
,
if
poor
Isabella
were
to
be
anywhere
but
at
Hartfield
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Woodhouse
could
never
allow
for
Mr.
Knightley
's
claims
on
his
brother
,
or
any
body
's
claims
on
Isabella
,
except
his
own
.
<EOS>
He
sat
musing
a
little
while
,
and
then
said
,
  
"
<EOS>
But
I
do
not
see
why
poor
Isabella
should
be
obliged
to
go
back
so
soon
,
though
he
does
.
<EOS>
I
think
,
Emma
,
I
shall
try
and
persuade
her
to
stay
longer
with
us
.
<EOS>
She
and
the
children
might
stay
very
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
papa
 
<EOS>
that
is
what
you
never
have
been
able
to
accomplish
,
and
I
do
not
think
you
ever
will
.
<EOS>
Isabella
can
not
bear
to
stay
behind
her
husband
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
was
too
true
for
contradiction
.
<EOS>
Unwelcome
as
it
was
,
Mr.
Woodhouse
could
only
give
a
submissive
sigh
;
and
as
Emma
saw
his
spirits
affected
by
the
idea
of
his
daughter
's
attachment
to
her
husband
,
she
immediately
led
to
such
a
branch
of
the
subject
as
must
raise
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
Harriet
must
give
us
as
much
of
her
company
as
she
can
while
my
brother
and
sister
are
here
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
she
will
be
pleased
with
the
children
.
<EOS>
We
are
very
proud
of
the
children
,
are
not
we
,
papa
?
<EOS>
I
wonder
which
she
will
think
the
handsomest
,
Henry
or
John
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
I
wonder
which
she
will
.
<EOS>
Poor
little
dears
,
how
glad
they
will
be
to
come
.
<EOS>
They
are
very
fond
of
being
at
Hartfield
,
Harriet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
dare
say
they
are
,
sir
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
I
do
not
know
who
is
not
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Henry
is
a
fine
boy
,
but
John
is
very
like
his
mama
.
<EOS>
Henry
is
the
eldest
,
he
was
named
after
me
,
not
after
his
father
.
<EOS>
John
,
the
second
,
is
named
after
his
father
.
<EOS>
Some
people
are
surprized
,
I
believe
,
that
the
eldest
was
not
,
but
Isabella
would
have
him
called
Henry
,
<EOS>
which
I
thought
very
pretty
of
her
.
<EOS>
And
he
is
a
very
clever
boy
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
They
are
all
remarkably
clever
;
and
they
have
so
many
pretty
ways
.
<EOS>
They
will
come
and
stand
by
my
chair
,
and
say
,
"
Grandpapa
,
can
you
give
me
a
bit
of
string
?
"
<EOS>
and
once
Henry
asked
me
for
a
knife
,
but
I
told
him
knives
were
only
made
for
grandpapas
.
<EOS>
I
think
their
father
is
too
rough
with
them
very
often
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
appears
rough
to
you
,
"
said
Emma
,
"
because
you
are
so
very
gentle
yourself
;
but
if
you
could
compare
him
with
other
papas
,
you
would
not
think
him
rough
.
<EOS>
He
wishes
his
boys
to
be
active
and
hardy
;
and
if
they
misbehave
,
can
give
them
a
sharp
word
now
and
then
;
but
he
is
an
affectionate
father
 
certainly
Mr.
John
Knightley
is
an
affectionate
father
.
<EOS>
The
children
are
all
fond
of
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
then
their
uncle
comes
in
,
and
tosses
them
up
to
the
ceiling
in
a
very
frightful
way
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
they
like
it
,
papa
;
there
is
nothing
they
like
so
much
.
<EOS>
It
is
such
enjoyment
to
them
,
that
if
their
uncle
did
not
lay
down
the
rule
of
their
taking
turns
,
whichever
began
would
never
give
way
to
the
other
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
can
not
understand
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
the
case
with
us
all
,
papa
.
<EOS>
One
half
of
the
world
can
not
understand
the
pleasures
of
the
other
.
"
  
<EOS>
Later
in
the
morning
,
and
just
as
the
girls
were
going
to
separate
in
preparation
for
the
regular
four
o'clock
dinner
,
the
hero
of
this
inimitable
charade
walked
in
again
.
<EOS>
Harriet
turned
away
;
but
Emma
could
receive
him
with
the
usual
smile
,
and
her
quick
eye
soon
discerned
in
his
the
consciousness
of
having
made
a
push
 
of
having
thrown
a
die
;
and
she
imagined
he
was
come
to
see
how
it
might
turn
up
.
<EOS>
His
ostensible
reason
,
however
,
was
to
ask
whether
Mr.
Woodhouse
's
party
could
be
made
up
in
the
evening
without
him
,
or
whether
he
should
be
in
the
smallest
degree
necessary
at
Hartfield
.
<EOS>
If
he
were
,
every
thing
else
must
give
way
;
but
otherwise
his
friend
Cole
had
been
saying
so
much
about
his
dining
with
him
 
had
made
such
a
point
of
it
,
that
he
had
promised
him
conditionally
to
come
.
  
<EOS>
Emma
thanked
him
,
but
could
not
allow
of
his
disappointing
his
friend
on
their
account
;
her
father
was
sure
of
his
rubber
.
<EOS>
He
re
-
urged
 
she
re
-
declined
;
and
he
seemed
then
about
to
make
his
bow
,
when
taking
the
paper
from
the
table
,
she
returned
it
    
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
here
is
the
charade
you
were
so
obliging
as
to
leave
with
us
;
thank
you
for
the
sight
of
it
.
<EOS>
We
admired
it
so
much
,
that
I
have
ventured
to
write
it
into
Miss
Smith
's
collection
.
<EOS>
Your
friend
will
not
take
it
<EOS>
amiss
<EOS>
I
hope
.
<EOS>
Of
course
I
have
not
transcribed
beyond
the
first
eight
lines
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Elton
certainly
did
not
very
well
know
what
to
say
.
<EOS>
He
looked
rather
doubtingly
 
rather
confused
;
said
something
about
"
honour
,
"
 
glanced
at
Emma
and
at
Harriet
,
and
then
seeing
the
book
open
on
the
table
,
took
it
up
,
and
examined
it
very
attentively
.
<EOS>
With
the
view
of
passing
off
an
awkward
moment
,
Emma
smilingly
said
,
  
"
You
must
make
my
apologies
to
your
friend
;
but
so
good
a
charade
must
not
be
confined
to
one
or
two
.
<EOS>
He
may
be
sure
of
every
woman
's
approbation
while
he
writes
with
such
gallantry
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
hesitation
in
saying
,
"
replied
Mr.
Elton
,
though
hesitating
a
good
deal
while
he
spoke
;
"
I
have
no
hesitation
in
saying
 
at
least
if
my
friend
feels
at
all
as
_
<EOS>
I
_
do
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
the
smallest
doubt
that
,
could
he
see
his
little
effusion
honoured
as
_
<EOS>
I
_
see
it
,
(
looking
at
the
book
again
,
and
replacing
it
on
the
table
)
,
he
would
consider
it
as
the
proudest
moment
of
his
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
After
this
speech
he
was
gone
as
soon
as
possible
.
<EOS>
Emma
could
not
think
it
too
soon
;
for
with
all
his
good
and
agreeable
qualities
,
there
was
a
sort
of
parade
in
his
speeches
which
was
very
apt
to
incline
her
to
laugh
.
<EOS>
She
ran
away
to
indulge
the
inclination
,
leaving
the
tender
and
the
sublime
of
pleasure
to
Harriet
's
share
.
    
<EOS>
Though
now
the
middle
of
December
,
there
had
yet
been
no
weather
to
prevent
the
young
ladies
from
tolerably
regular
exercise
;
and
on
the
morrow
,
Emma
had
a
charitable
visit
to
pay
to
a
poor
sick
family
,
who
lived
a
little
way
out
of
Highbury
.
  
<EOS>
Their
road
to
this
detached
cottage
was
down
Vicarage
Lane
,
a
lane
leading
at
right
angles
from
the
broad
,
though
irregular
,
main
street
of
the
place
;
and
,
as
may
be
inferred
,
containing
the
blessed
abode
of
Mr.
Elton
.
<EOS>
A
few
inferior
dwellings
were
first
to
be
passed
,
and
then
,
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
down
the
lane
rose
the
Vicarage
,
an
old
and
not
very
good
house
,
almost
as
close
to
the
road
as
it
could
be
.
<EOS>
It
had
no
advantage
of
situation
;
but
had
been
very
much
smartened
up
by
the
present
proprietor
;
and
,
such
as
it
was
,
there
could
be
no
possibility
of
the
two
friends
passing
it
without
a
slackened
pace
and
observing
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
Emma
's
remark
was
    
<EOS>
"
There
it
is
.
<EOS>
There
go
you
and
your
riddle
-
book
one
of
these
days
.
"
 
<EOS>
Harriet
's
was
    
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
what
a
sweet
house
!
 
<EOS>
How
very
beautiful
!
 
<EOS>
There
are
the
yellow
curtains
that
Miss
Nash
admires
so
much
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
often
walk
this
way
_
now
_
,
"
said
Emma
,
as
they
proceeded
,
"
but
_
then
_
there
will
be
an
inducement
,
and
I
shall
gradually
get
intimately
acquainted
with
all
the
hedges
,
gates
,
pools
and
pollards
of
this
part
of
Highbury
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Harriet
,
she
found
,
had
never
in
her
life
been
within
side
the
Vicarage
,
and
her
curiosity
to
see
it
was
so
extreme
,
that
,
considering
exteriors
and
probabilities
,
Emma
could
only
class
it
,
as
a
proof
of
love
,
with
Mr.
Elton
's
seeing
ready
wit
in
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
we
could
contrive
it
,
"
said
she
;
<EOS>
"
but
I
can
not
think
of
any
tolerable
pretence
for
going
in
;
 
no
servant
that
I
want
to
inquire
about
of
his
housekeeper
 
<EOS>
no
message
from
my
father
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
pondered
,
but
could
think
of
nothing
.
<EOS>
After
a
mutual
silence
of
some
minutes
,
Harriet
thus
began
again
    
"
I
do
so
wonder
,
Miss
Woodhouse
,
that
you
should
not
be
married
,
or
going
to
be
married
!
<EOS>
so
charming
as
you
are
!
"
    
<EOS>
Emma
laughed
,
and
replied
,
  
"
My
being
charming
,
Harriet
,
is
not
quite
enough
to
induce
me
to
marry
;
I
must
find
other
people
charming
 
one
other
person
at
least
.
<EOS>
And
I
am
not
only
,
not
going
to
be
married
,
at
present
,
but
have
very
little
intention
of
ever
marrying
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
 
<EOS>
so
you
say
;
<EOS>
but
I
can
not
believe
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
see
somebody
very
superior
to
any
one
I
have
seen
yet
,
to
be
tempted
;
Mr.
Elton
,
you
know
,
(
recollecting
herself
,
)
is
out
of
the
question
:
and
I
do
_
not
_
wish
to
see
any
such
person
.
<EOS>
I
would
rather
not
be
tempted
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
really
change
for
the
better
.
<EOS>
If
I
were
to
marry
,
I
must
expect
to
repent
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
!
 
<EOS>
it
is
so
odd
to
hear
a
woman
talk
so
!
"
    
<EOS>
"
I
have
none
of
the
usual
inducements
of
women
to
marry
.
<EOS>
Were
I
to
fall
in
love
,
indeed
,
it
would
be
a
different
thing
!
<EOS>
but
I
never
have
been
in
love
;
it
is
not
my
way
,
or
my
nature
;
and
I
do
not
think
I
ever
shall
.
<EOS>
And
,
without
love
,
I
am
sure
I
should
be
a
fool
to
change
such
a
situation
as
mine
.
<EOS>
Fortune
I
do
not
want
;
employment
I
do
not
want
;
consequence
I
do
not
want
:
I
believe
few
married
women
are
half
as
much
mistress
of
their
husband
's
house
as
I
am
of
Hartfield
;
and
never
,
never
could
I
expect
to
be
so
truly
beloved
and
important
;
so
always
first
and
always
right
in
any
man
's
eyes
as
I
am
in
my
father
's
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
But
then
,
to
be
an
old
maid
at
last
,
like
Miss
Bates
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
as
formidable
an
image
as
you
could
present
,
Harriet
;
and
if
I
thought
I
should
ever
be
like
Miss
Bates
!
<EOS>
so
silly
 
<EOS>
so
satisfied
 
<EOS>
so
smiling
 
<EOS>
so
prosing
 
so
undistinguishing
and
unfastidious
 
and
so
apt
to
tell
every
thing
relative
to
every
body
about
me
,
I
would
marry
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
But
between
_
us
_
,
I
am
convinced
there
never
can
be
any
likeness
,
except
in
being
unmarried
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
still
,
you
will
be
an
old
maid
!
<EOS>
and
that
's
so
dreadful
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Never
mind
,
Harriet
<EOS>
,
I
shall
not
be
a
poor
old
maid
;
and
it
is
poverty
only
which
makes
celibacy
contemptible
to
a
generous
public
!
<EOS>
A
single
woman
,
with
a
very
narrow
income
,
must
be
a
ridiculous
,
disagreeable
old
maid
!
<EOS>
the
proper
sport
of
boys
and
girls
,
but
a
single
woman
,
of
good
fortune
,
is
always
respectable
,
and
may
be
as
sensible
and
pleasant
as
any
body
else
.
<EOS>
And
the
distinction
is
not
quite
so
much
against
the
candour
and
common
sense
of
the
world
as
appears
at
first
;
for
a
very
narrow
income
has
a
tendency
to
contract
the
mind
,
and
sour
the
temper
.
<EOS>
Those
who
can
barely
live
,
and
who
live
perforce
in
a
very
small
,
and
generally
very
inferior
,
society
,
may
well
be
illiberal
and
cross
.
<EOS>
This
does
not
apply
,
however
,
to
Miss
Bates
;
she
is
only
too
good
natured
and
too
silly
to
suit
me
;
but
,
in
general
,
she
is
very
much
to
the
taste
of
every
body
,
though
single
and
though
poor
.
<EOS>
Poverty
certainly
has
not
contracted
her
mind
<EOS>
:
I
really
believe
,
if
she
had
only
a
shilling
in
the
world
,
she
would
be
very
likely
to
give
away
sixpence
of
it
;
and
nobody
is
afraid
of
her
:
that
is
a
great
charm
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
!
<EOS>
but
what
shall
you
do
?
<EOS>
how
shall
you
employ
yourself
when
you
grow
old
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
know
myself
,
Harriet
,
mine
is
an
active
,
busy
mind
,
with
a
great
many
independent
resources
;
and
I
do
not
perceive
why
I
should
be
more
in
want
of
employment
at
forty
or
fifty
than
one
-
and
-
twenty
.
<EOS>
Woman
's
usual
occupations
of
hand
and
mind
will
be
as
open
to
me
then
as
they
are
now
;
or
with
no
important
variation
.
<EOS>
If
I
draw
less
,
I
shall
read
more
;
if
I
give
up
music
,
I
shall
take
to
carpet
-
work
.
<EOS>
And
as
for
objects
of
interest
,
objects
for
the
affections
,
which
is
in
truth
the
great
point
of
inferiority
,
the
want
of
which
is
really
the
great
evil
to
be
avoided
in
_
<EOS>
not
_
marrying
,
I
shall
be
very
well
off
,
with
all
the
children
of
a
sister
I
love
so
much
,
to
care
about
.
<EOS>
There
will
be
enough
of
them
,
in
all
probability
,
to
supply
every
sort
of
sensation
that
declining
life
can
need
.
<EOS>
There
will
be
enough
for
every
hope
and
every
fear
;
and
though
my
attachment
to
none
can
equal
that
of
a
parent
,
it
suits
my
ideas
of
comfort
better
than
what
is
warmer
and
blinder
.
<EOS>
My
nephews
and
nieces
!
 
<EOS>
I
shall
often
have
a
niece
with
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
know
Miss
Bates
's
niece
?
<EOS>
That
is
,
I
know
you
must
have
seen
her
a
hundred
times
 
<EOS>
but
are
you
acquainted
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
yes
;
we
are
always
forced
to
be
acquainted
whenever
she
comes
to
Highbury
.
<EOS>
By
the
bye
,
_
that
_
is
almost
enough
to
put
one
out
of
conceit
with
a
niece
.
<EOS>
Heaven
forbid
!
<EOS>
at
least
,
that
I
should
ever
bore
people
half
so
much
about
all
the
Knightleys
together
,
as
she
does
about
Jane
Fairfax
.
<EOS>
One
is
sick
of
the
very
name
of
Jane
Fairfax
.
<EOS>
Every
letter
from
her
is
read
forty
times
over
;
her
compliments
to
all
friends
go
round
and
round
again
;
and
if
she
does
but
send
her
aunt
<EOS>
the
pattern
of
a
stomacher
,
or
knit
a
pair
of
garters
for
her
grandmother
,
one
hears
of
nothing
else
for
a
month
.
<EOS>
I
wish
Jane
Fairfax
very
well
;
but
she
tires
me
to
death
.
"
  
<EOS>
They
were
now
approaching
the
cottage
,
and
all
idle
topics
were
superseded
.
<EOS>
Emma
was
very
compassionate
;
and
the
distresses
of
the
poor
were
as
sure
of
relief
from
her
personal
attention
and
kindness
,
her
counsel
and
her
patience
,
as
from
her
purse
.
<EOS>
She
understood
their
ways
,
could
allow
for
their
ignorance
and
their
temptations
,
had
no
romantic
expectations
of
extraordinary
virtue
from
those
for
whom
education
had
done
so
little
;
entered
into
their
troubles
with
ready
sympathy
,
and
always
gave
her
assistance
with
as
much
intelligence
as
good
-
will
.
<EOS>
In
the
present
instance
,
it
was
sickness
and
poverty
together
which
she
came
to
visit
;
and
after
remaining
there
as
long
as
she
could
give
comfort
or
advice
,
she
quitted
the
cottage
with
such
an
impression
of
the
scene
as
made
her
say
to
Harriet
,
as
they
walked
away
,
  
"
<EOS>
These
are
the
sights
,
Harriet
,
to
do
one
good
.
<EOS>
How
trifling
they
make
every
thing
else
appear
!
 
<EOS>
I
feel
now
as
if
I
could
think
of
nothing
but
these
poor
creatures
all
the
rest
of
the
day
;
and
yet
,
who
can
say
how
soon
it
may
all
vanish
from
my
mind
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
true
,
"
said
Harriet
.
<EOS>
"
Poor
creatures
!
<EOS>
one
can
think
of
nothing
else
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
really
,
I
do
not
think
the
impression
will
soon
be
over
,
"
said
Emma
,
as
she
crossed
the
low
hedge
,
and
tottering
footstep
which
ended
the
narrow
,
slippery
path
through
the
cottage
garden
,
and
brought
them
into
the
lane
again
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
it
will
,
"
stopping
to
look
once
more
at
all
the
outward
wretchedness
of
the
place
,
and
recall
the
still
greater
within
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
<EOS>
dear
,
no
,
"
said
her
companion
.
  
<EOS>
They
walked
on
.
<EOS>
The
lane
made
a
slight
bend
;
and
when
that
bend
was
passed
,
Mr.
Elton
was
immediately
in
sight
;
and
so
near
as
to
give
Emma
time
only
to
say
farther
,
  
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
Harriet
,
here
comes
a
very
sudden
trial
of
our
stability
in
good
thoughts
.
<EOS>
Well
,
(
smiling
,
)
<EOS>
I
hope
it
may
be
allowed
that
if
compassion
has
produced
exertion
and
relief
to
the
sufferers
,
it
has
done
all
that
is
truly
important
.
<EOS>
If
we
feel
for
the
wretched
,
enough
to
do
all
we
can
for
them
,
the
rest
is
empty
sympathy
,
only
distressing
to
ourselves
.
"
  
<EOS>
Harriet
could
just
answer
,
"
Oh
!
<EOS>
dear
,
yes
,
"
before
the
gentleman
joined
them
.
<EOS>
The
wants
and
sufferings
of
the
poor
family
,
however
,
were
the
first
subject
on
meeting
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
going
to
call
on
them
.
<EOS>
His
visit
he
would
now
defer
;
but
they
had
a
very
interesting
parley
about
what
could
be
done
and
should
be
done
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Elton
then
turned
back
to
accompany
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
To
fall
in
with
each
other
on
such
an
errand
as
this
,
"
thought
Emma
;
"
to
meet
in
a
charitable
scheme
;
this
will
bring
a
great
increase
of
love
on
each
side
.
<EOS>
I
should
not
wonder
if
it
were
to
bring
on
the
declaration
.
<EOS>
It
must
,
if
I
were
not
here
.
<EOS>
I
wish
I
were
anywhere
else
.
"
  
<EOS>
Anxious
to
separate
herself
from
them
as
far
as
she
could
,
she
soon
afterwards
took
possession
of
a
narrow
footpath
,
a
little
raised
on
one
side
of
the
lane
,
leaving
them
together
in
the
main
road
.
<EOS>
But
she
had
not
been
there
two
minutes
when
she
found
that
Harriet
's
habits
of
dependence
and
imitation
were
bringing
her
up
too
,
and
that
,
in
short
,
they
would
both
be
soon
after
her
.
<EOS>
This
would
not
do
;
she
immediately
stopped
,
under
pretence
of
having
some
alteration
to
make
in
the
lacing
of
her
half
-
boot
,
and
stooping
down
in
complete
occupation
of
the
footpath
,
begged
them
to
have
the
goodness
to
walk
on
,
and
she
would
follow
in
half
a
minute
.
<EOS>
They
did
as
they
were
desired
;
and
by
the
time
she
judged
it
reasonable
to
have
done
with
her
boot
<EOS>
,
she
had
the
comfort
of
farther
delay
in
her
power
,
being
overtaken
by
a
child
from
the
cottage
,
setting
out
,
according
to
orders
,
with
her
pitcher
,
to
fetch
broth
from
Hartfield
.
<EOS>
To
walk
by
the
side
of
this
child
,
and
talk
to
and
question
her
,
was
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
,
or
would
have
been
the
most
natural
,
had
she
been
acting
just
then
without
design
;
and
by
this
means
the
others
were
still
able
to
keep
ahead
,
without
any
obligation
of
waiting
for
her
.
<EOS>
She
gained
on
them
,
however
,
involuntarily
:
the
child
's
pace
was
quick
,
and
theirs
rather
slow
;
and
she
was
the
more
concerned
at
it
,
from
their
being
evidently
in
a
conversation
which
interested
them
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Elton
was
speaking
with
animation
,
Harriet
listening
with
a
very
pleased
attention
;
and
Emma
,
having
sent
the
child
on
,
was
beginning
to
think
how
she
might
draw
back
a
little
more
,
when
they
both
looked
around
,
and
she
was
obliged
to
join
them
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Elton
was
still
talking
,
still
engaged
in
some
interesting
detail
;
and
Emma
experienced
some
disappointment
when
she
found
that
he
was
only
giving
his
fair
companion
an
account
of
the
yesterday
's
party
at
his
friend
Cole
's
,
and
that
she
was
come
in
herself
for
the
Stilton
cheese
,
the
north
Wiltshire
,
the
butter
,
the
celery
,
the
beet
-
root
,
and
all
the
dessert
.
  
<EOS>
"
This
would
soon
have
led
to
something
better
,
of
course
,
"
was
her
consoling
reflection
;
"
any
thing
interests
between
those
who
love
;
and
any
thing
will
serve
as
introduction
to
what
is
near
the
heart
.
<EOS>
If
I
could
but
have
kept
longer
away
!
"
  
<EOS>
They
now
walked
on
together
quietly
,
till
within
view
of
the
vicarage
pales
,
when
a
sudden
resolution
,
of
at
least
getting
Harriet
into
the
house
,
made
her
again
find
something
very
much
amiss
about
her
boot
,
and
fall
behind
to
arrange
it
once
more
.
<EOS>
She
then
broke
the
lace
off
short
,
and
dexterously
throwing
it
into
a
ditch
,
was
presently
obliged
to
entreat
them
to
stop
,
and
acknowledged
her
inability
to
put
herself
to
rights
so
as
to
be
able
to
walk
home
in
tolerable
comfort
.
  
<EOS>
"
Part
of
my
lace
is
gone
,
"
said
she
,
"
and
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
how
I
am
to
contrive
.
<EOS>
I
really
am
a
most
troublesome
companion
to
you
both
,
but
I
hope
I
am
not
often
so
ill
-
equipped
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Elton
,
I
must
beg
leave
to
stop
at
your
house
,
and
ask
your
housekeeper
for
a
bit
of
ribband
or
string
,
or
any
thing
just
to
keep
my
boot
on
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Elton
looked
all
happiness
at
this
proposition
;
and
nothing
could
exceed
his
alertness
and
attention
in
conducting
them
into
his
house
and
endeavouring
to
make
every
thing
appear
to
advantage
.
<EOS>
The
room
they
were
taken
into
was
the
one
he
chiefly
occupied
,
and
looking
forwards
;
behind
it
was
another
with
which
it
immediately
communicated
;
the
door
between
them
was
open
,
and
Emma
passed
into
it
with
the
housekeeper
to
receive
her
assistance
in
the
most
comfortable
manner
.
<EOS>
She
was
obliged
to
leave
the
door
ajar
as
she
found
it
;
but
she
fully
intended
that
Mr.
Elton
should
close
it
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
closed
,
however
,
it
still
remained
ajar
;
but
by
engaging
the
housekeeper
in
incessant
conversation
,
she
hoped
to
make
it
practicable
for
him
to
chuse
his
own
subject
in
the
adjoining
room
.
<EOS>
For
ten
minutes
she
could
hear
nothing
but
herself
.
<EOS>
It
could
be
protracted
no
longer
.
<EOS>
She
was
then
obliged
to
be
finished
,
and
make
her
appearance
.
  
<EOS>
The
lovers
were
standing
together
at
one
of
the
windows
.
<EOS>
It
had
a
most
favourable
aspect
;
and
,
for
half
a
minute
,
Emma
felt
the
glory
of
having
schemed
successfully
.
<EOS>
But
it
would
not
do
;
he
had
not
come
to
the
point
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
most
agreeable
,
most
delightful
;
he
had
told
Harriet
that
he
had
seen
them
go
by
,
and
had
purposely
followed
them
;
other
little
gallantries
and
allusions
had
been
dropt
,
but
nothing
serious
.
  
<EOS>
"
Cautious
,
very
cautious
,
"
thought
Emma
;
"
he
advances
inch
by
inch
,
and
will
hazard
nothing
till
he
believes
himself
secure
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Still
,
however
,
though
every
thing
had
not
been
accomplished
by
her
ingenious
device
,
she
could
not
but
flatter
herself
that
it
had
been
the
occasion
of
much
present
enjoyment
to
both
,
and
must
be
leading
them
forward
to
the
great
event
.
    
<EOS>
Mr.
Elton
must
now
be
left
to
himself
.
<EOS>
It
was
no
longer
in
Emma
's
power
to
superintend
his
happiness
or
quicken
his
measures
.
<EOS>
The
coming
of
her
sister
's
family
was
so
very
near
at
hand
,
that
first
in
anticipation
,
and
then
in
reality
,
it
became
henceforth
her
prime
object
of
interest
;
and
during
the
ten
days
of
their
stay
at
Hartfield
it
was
not
to
be
expected
 
<EOS>
she
did
not
herself
expect
 
that
any
thing
beyond
occasional
,
fortuitous
assistance
could
be
afforded
by
her
to
the
lovers
.
<EOS>
They
might
advance
rapidly
if
they
would
,
however
;
they
must
advance
somehow
or
other
whether
they
would
or
no
.
<EOS>
She
hardly
wished
to
have
more
leisure
for
them
.
<EOS>
There
are
people
,
who
the
more
you
do
for
them
,
the
less
they
will
do
for
themselves
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
and
Mrs.
John
Knightley
,
from
having
been
longer
than
usual
absent
from
Surry
,
were
exciting
of
course
rather
more
than
the
usual
interest
.
<EOS>
Till
this
year
,
every
long
vacation
since
their
marriage
had
been
divided
between
Hartfield
and
Donwell
Abbey
;
but
all
the
holidays
of
this
autumn
had
been
given
to
sea
-
bathing
for
the
children
,
and
it
was
therefore
many
months
since
they
had
been
seen
in
a
regular
way
by
their
Surry
connexions
,
or
seen
at
all
by
Mr.
Woodhouse
,
who
could
not
be
induced
to
get
so
far
as
London
,
even
for
poor
Isabella
's
sake
;
and
who
consequently
was
now
most
nervously
and
apprehensively
happy
in
forestalling
this
too
short
visit
.
  
<EOS>
He
thought
much
of
the
evils
of
the
journey
for
her
,
and
not
a
little
of
the
fatigues
of
his
own
horses
and
coachman
who
were
to
bring
some
of
the
party
the
last
half
of
the
way
;
but
his
alarms
were
needless
;
the
sixteen
miles
being
happily
accomplished
,
and
Mr.
and
Mrs.
John
Knightley
,
their
five
children
,
and
a
competent
number
of
nursery
-
maids
,
all
reaching
Hartfield
in
safety
.
<EOS>
The
bustle
and
joy
of
such
an
arrival
,
the
many
to
be
talked
to
,
welcomed
,
encouraged
,
and
variously
dispersed
and
disposed
of
,
produced
a
noise
and
confusion
which
his
nerves
could
not
have
borne
under
any
other
cause
,
nor
have
endured
much
longer
even
for
this
;
but
the
ways
of
Hartfield
and
the
feelings
of
her
father
were
so
respected
by
Mrs.
John
Knightley
,
that
in
spite
of
maternal
solicitude
for
the
immediate
enjoyment
of
her
little
ones
,
and
for
their
having
instantly
all
the
liberty
and
attendance
,
all
the
eating
and
drinking
,
and
sleeping
and
playing
,
which
they
could
possibly
wish
for
,
without
the
smallest
delay
,
the
children
were
never
allowed
to
be
long
a
disturbance
to
him
,
either
in
themselves
or
in
any
restless
attendance
on
them
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
John
Knightley
was
a
pretty
,
elegant
little
woman
,
of
gentle
,
quiet
manners
,
and
a
disposition
remarkably
amiable
and
affectionate
;
wrapt
up
in
her
family
;
a
devoted
wife
,
a
doating
mother
,
and
so
tenderly
attached
to
her
father
and
sister
that
,
but
for
these
higher
ties
,
a
warmer
love
might
have
seemed
impossible
.
<EOS>
She
could
never
see
a
fault
in
any
of
them
.
<EOS>
She
was
not
a
woman
of
strong
understanding
or
any
quickness
;
and
with
this
resemblance
of
her
father
,
she
inherited
also
much
of
his
constitution
;
was
delicate
in
her
own
health
,
over
-
careful
of
that
of
her
children
,
had
many
fears
and
many
nerves
,
and
was
as
fond
of
her
own
Mr.
Wingfield
in
town
as
her
father
could
be
of
Mr.
Perry
.
<EOS>
They
were
alike
too
,
in
a
general
benevolence
of
temper
,
and
a
strong
habit
of
regard
for
every
old
acquaintance
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
John
Knightley
was
a
tall
,
gentleman
-
like
,
and
very
clever
man
;
rising
in
his
profession
,
domestic
,
and
respectable
in
his
private
character
;
but
with
reserved
manners
which
prevented
his
being
generally
pleasing
;
and
capable
of
being
sometimes
out
of
humour
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
an
ill
-
tempered
man
,
not
so
often
unreasonably
cross
as
to
deserve
such
a
reproach
;
but
his
temper
was
not
his
great
perfection
;
and
,
indeed
,
with
such
a
worshipping
wife
,
it
was
hardly
possible
that
any
natural
defects
in
it
should
not
be
increased
.
<EOS>
The
extreme
sweetness
of
her
temper
must
hurt
his
.
<EOS>
He
had
all
the
clearness
and
quickness
of
mind
which
she
wanted
,
and
he
could
sometimes
act
an
ungracious
,
or
say
a
severe
thing
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
not
a
great
favourite
with
his
fair
sister
-
in
-
law
.
<EOS>
Nothing
wrong
in
him
escaped
her
.
<EOS>
She
was
quick
in
feeling
the
little
injuries
to
Isabella
,
which
Isabella
never
felt
herself
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
she
might
have
passed
over
more
had
his
manners
been
flattering
to
Isabella
's
sister
,
but
they
were
only
those
of
a
calmly
kind
brother
and
friend
,
without
praise
and
without
blindness
;
but
hardly
any
degree
of
personal
compliment
could
have
made
her
regardless
of
that
greatest
fault
of
all
in
her
eyes
which
he
sometimes
fell
into
,
the
want
of
respectful
forbearance
towards
her
father
.
<EOS>
There
he
had
not
always
the
patience
that
could
have
been
wished
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Woodhouse
's
peculiarities
and
fidgetiness
were
sometimes
provoking
him
to
a
rational
remonstrance
or
sharp
retort
equally
ill
-
bestowed
.
<EOS>
It
did
not
often
happen
;
for
Mr.
John
Knightley
had
really
a
great
regard
for
his
father
-
in
-
law
,
and
generally
a
strong
sense
of
what
was
due
to
him
;
but
it
was
too
often
for
Emma
's
charity
,
especially
as
there
was
all
the
pain
of
apprehension
frequently
to
be
endured
,
though
the
offence
came
not
.
<EOS>
The
beginning
,
however
,
of
every
visit
displayed
none
but
the
properest
feelings
,
and
this
being
of
necessity
so
short
might
be
hoped
to
pass
away
in
unsullied
cordiality
.
<EOS>
They
had
not
been
long
seated
and
composed
when
Mr.
Woodhouse
,
with
a
melancholy
shake
of
the
head
and
a
sigh
,
called
his
daughter
's
attention
to
the
sad
change
at
Hartfield
since
she
had
been
there
last
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
my
dear
,
"
said
he
,
"
poor
Miss
Taylor
 
<EOS>
It
is
a
grievous
business
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
yes
,
sir
,
"
cried
she
with
ready
sympathy
,
"
how
you
must
miss
her
!
<EOS>
And
dear
Emma
,
too
!
 
<EOS>
What
a
dreadful
loss
to
you
both
!
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
so
grieved
for
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
imagine
how
you
could
possibly
do
without
her
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
a
sad
change
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
hope
she
is
pretty
well
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Pretty
well
,
my
dear
 
<EOS>
I
hope
 
pretty
well
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
but
<EOS>
that
the
place
agrees
with
her
tolerably
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
John
Knightley
here
asked
Emma
quietly
whether
there
were
any
doubts
of
the
air
of
Randalls
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
no
 
<EOS>
none
in
the
least
.
<EOS>
I
never
saw
Mrs.
Weston
better
in
my
life
 
never
looking
so
well
.
<EOS>
Papa
is
only
speaking
his
own
regret
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
much
to
the
honour
of
both
,
"
was
the
handsome
reply
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
do
you
see
her
,
sir
,
tolerably
often
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Isabella
in
the
plaintive
tone
which
just
suited
her
father
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Woodhouse
hesitated
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
near
so
often
,
my
dear
,
as
I
could
wish
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
papa
,
we
have
missed
seeing
them
but
<EOS>
one
entire
day
since
they
married
.
<EOS>
Either
in
the
morning
or
evening
of
every
day
,
excepting
one
,
have
we
seen
either
Mr.
Weston
or
Mrs.
Weston
,
and
generally
both
,
either
at
Randalls
or
here
 
<EOS>
and
as
you
may
suppose
,
Isabella
,
most
frequently
here
.
<EOS>
They
are
very
,
very
kind
in
their
visits
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Weston
is
really
as
kind
as
herself
.
<EOS>
Papa
,
if
you
speak
in
that
melancholy
way
,
you
will
be
giving
Isabella
a
false
idea
of
us
all
.
<EOS>
Every
body
must
be
aware
that
Miss
Taylor
must
be
missed
,
but
every
body
ought
also
to
be
assured
that
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Weston
do
really
prevent
our
missing
her
by
any
means
to
the
extent
we
ourselves
anticipated
 
which
is
the
exact
truth
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Just
as
it
should
be
,
"
said
Mr.
John
Knightley
,
"
and
just
as
I
hoped
it
was
from
your
letters
.
<EOS>
Her
wish
of
shewing
you
attention
could
not
be
doubted
,
and
his
being
a
disengaged
and
social
man
makes
it
all
easy
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
always
telling
you
,
my
love
,
that
I
had
no
idea
of
the
change
being
so
very
material
to
Hartfield
as
you
apprehended
;
and
now
you
have
Emma
's
account
<EOS>
,
I
hope
you
will
be
satisfied
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
to
be
sure
,
"
said
Mr.
Woodhouse
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
certainly
 
I
can
not
deny
that
Mrs.
Weston
,
poor
Mrs.
Weston
,
does
come
and
see
us
pretty
often
 
<EOS>
but
then
 
she
is
always
obliged
to
go
away
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
very
hard
upon
Mr.
Weston
if
she
did
not
,
papa
.
 
<EOS>
You
quite
forget
poor
Mr.
Weston
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
indeed
,
"
said
John
Knightley
pleasantly
,
"
that
Mr.
Weston
has
some
little
claim
.
<EOS>
You
and
I
,
Emma
,
will
venture
to
take
the
part
of
the
poor
husband
.
<EOS>
I
,
being
a
husband
,
and
you
not
being
a
wife
,
the
claims
of
the
man
may
very
likely
strike
us
with
equal
force
.
<EOS>
As
for
Isabella
,
she
has
been
married
long
enough
to
see
the
convenience
of
putting
all
the
Mr.
Westons
aside
as
much
as
she
can
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Me
,
my
love
,
"
cried
his
wife
,
hearing
and
understanding
only
in
part
.
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
talking
about
me
?
 
<EOS>
I
am
sure
nobody
ought
to
be
,
or
can
be
,
a
greater
advocate
for
matrimony
than
I
am
;
and
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
misery
of
her
leaving
Hartfield
,
I
should
never
have
thought
of
Miss
Taylor
but
as
the
most
fortunate
woman
in
the
world
;
and
as
to
slighting
Mr.
Weston
,
that
excellent
Mr.
Weston
,
I
think
there
is
nothing
he
does
not
deserve
.
<EOS>
I
believe
he
is
one
of
the
very
best
-
tempered
men
that
ever
existed
.
<EOS>
Excepting
yourself
and
your
brother
,
I
do
not
know
his
equal
for
temper
.
<EOS>
I
shall
never
forget
his
flying
Henry
's
kite
for
him
that
very
windy
day
<EOS>
last
Easter
 
and
ever
since
his
particular
kindness
last
September
twelvemonth
in
writing
that
note
,
at
twelve
o'clock
at
night
,
on
purpose
to
assure
me
that
there
was
no
scarlet
fever
at
Cobham
,
I
have
been
convinced
there
could
not
be
a
more
feeling
heart
nor
a
better
man
in
existence
.
 
<EOS>
If
any
body
can
deserve
him
,
it
must
be
Miss
Taylor
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Where
is
the
young
man
?
"
said
John
Knightley
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Has
he
been
here
on
this
occasion
 
or
has
he
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
has
not
been
here
yet
,
"
replied
Emma
.
<EOS>
"
There
was
a
strong
expectation
of
his
coming
soon
after
the
marriage
,
but
it
ended
in
nothing
;
and
I
have
not
heard
him
mentioned
lately
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
should
tell
them
of
the
letter
,
my
dear
,
"
said
her
father
.
"
<EOS>
He
wrote
a
letter
to
poor
Mrs.
Weston
,
to
congratulate
her
,
and
a
very
proper
,
handsome
letter
it
was
.
<EOS>
She
shewed
it
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
thought
it
very
well
done
of
him
indeed
.
<EOS>
Whether
it
was
his
own
idea
you
know
,
one
can
not
tell
.
<EOS>
He
is
but
young
,
and
his
uncle
,
perhaps
 
"
  
"
My
dear
papa
,
he
is
three
-
and
-
twenty
.
<EOS>
You
forget
how
time
passes
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Three
-
and
-
twenty
!
 
<EOS>
is
he
indeed
?
 
<EOS>
Well
,
I
could
not
have
thought
it
 
<EOS>
and
he
was
<EOS>
but
two
years
old
when
he
lost
his
poor
mother
!
<EOS>
Well
,
time
does
fly
indeed
!
 
<EOS>
and
my
memory
is
very
bad
.
<EOS>
However
,
it
was
an
exceeding
good
,
pretty
letter
,
and
gave
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Weston
<EOS>
a
great
deal
of
pleasure
.
<EOS>
I
remember
it
was
written
from
Weymouth
,
and
dated
Sept.
28th
 
and
began
,
"
My
dear
Madam
,
"
but
I
forget
how
it
went
on
;
and
it
was
signed
"
F.
C.
Weston
Churchill
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
remember
that
perfectly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
very
pleasing
and
proper
of
him
!
"
cried
the
good
-
hearted
Mrs.
John
Knightley
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
doubt
of
his
being
a
most
amiable
young
man
.
<EOS>
But
how
sad
it
is
that
he
should
not
live
at
home
with
his
father
!
<EOS>
There
is
something
so
shocking
in
a
child
's
being
taken
away
from
his
parents
and
natural
home
!
<EOS>
I
never
could
comprehend
how
Mr.
Weston
could
part
with
him
.
<EOS>
To
give
up
one
's
child
!
<EOS>
I
really
never
could
think
well
of
any
body
who
proposed
such
a
thing
to
any
body
else
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nobody
ever
did
think
well
of
the
Churchills
,
I
fancy
,
"
observed
Mr.
John
Knightley
coolly
.
<EOS>
"
But
you
need
not
imagine
Mr.
Weston
to
have
felt
what
you
would
feel
in
giving
up
Henry
or
John
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Weston
is
rather
an
easy
,
cheerful
-
tempered
man
,
than
a
man
of
strong
feelings
;
he
takes
things
as
he
finds
them
,
and
makes
enjoyment
of
them
somehow
or
other
,
depending
,
I
suspect
,
much
more
upon
what
is
called
society
for
his
comforts
,
that
is
,
upon
the
power
of
eating
and
drinking
,
and
playing
whist
with
his
neighbours
five
times
a
week
,
than
upon
family
affection
,
or
any
thing
that
home
affords
.
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
could
not
like
what
bordered
on
a
reflection
on
Mr.
Weston
,
and
had
half
a
mind
to
take
it
up
;
but
she
struggled
,
and
let
it
pass
.
<EOS>
She
would
keep
the
peace
if
possible
;
and
there
was
something
honourable
and
valuable
in
the
strong
domestic
habits
,
the
all
-
sufficiency
of
home
to
himself
,
whence
resulted
her
brother
's
disposition
to
look
down
on
the
common
rate
of
social
intercourse
,
and
those
to
whom
it
was
important
.
 
<EOS>
It
had
a
high
claim
to
forbearance
.
    
<EOS>
Mr.
Knightley
was
to
dine
with
them
 
rather
against
the
inclination
of
Mr.
Woodhouse
,
who
did
not
like
that
any
one
should
share
with
him
in
Isabella
's
first
day
.
<EOS>
Emma
's
sense
of
right
however
had
decided
it
;
and
besides
the
consideration
of
what
was
due
to
each
brother
,
she
had
particular
pleasure
,
from
the
circumstance
of
the
late
disagreement
between
Mr.
Knightley
and
herself
,
in
procuring
him
the
proper
invitation
.
  
<EOS>
She
hoped
they
might
now
become
friends
again
.
<EOS>
She
thought
it
was
time
to
make
up
.
<EOS>
Making
-
up
indeed
would
not
do
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
She
_
certainly
had
not
been
in
the
wrong
,
and
_
he
_
would
never
own
that
he
had
.
<EOS>
Concession
must
be
out
of
the
question
;
but
it
was
time
to
appear
to
forget
that
they
had
ever
quarrelled
;
and
she
hoped
it
might
rather
assist
the
restoration
of
friendship
,
<EOS>
that
when
he
came
into
the
room
she
had
one
of
the
children
with
her
 
the
youngest
,
a
nice
little
girl
about
eight
months
old
,
who
was
now
making
her
first
visit
to
Hartfield
,
and
very
happy
to
be
danced
about
in
her
aunt
's
arms
.
<EOS>
It
did
assist
;
for
though
he
began
with
grave
looks
and
short
questions
,
he
was
soon
led
on
to
talk
of
them
all
in
the
usual
way
,
and
to
take
the
child
out
of
her
arms
with
all
the
unceremoniousness
of
perfect
amity
.
<EOS>
Emma
felt
they
were
friends
again
;
and
the
conviction
giving
her
at
first
great
satisfaction
,
and
then
a
little
sauciness
,
she
could
not
help
saying
,
as
he
was
admiring
the
baby
,
  
<EOS>
"
What
a
comfort
it
is
,
that
we
think
alike
about
our
nephews
and
nieces
.
<EOS>
As
to
men
and
women
,
our
opinions
are
sometimes
very
different
;
but
with
regard
to
these
children
,
I
observe
we
never
disagree
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
were
as
much
guided
by
nature
in
your
estimate
of
men
and
women
,
and
as
little
under
the
power
of
fancy
and
whim
in
your
dealings
with
them
,
as
you
are
where
these
children
are
concerned
,
we
might
always
think
alike
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
To
be
sure
 
our
discordancies
must
always
arise
from
my
being
in
the
wrong
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
he
,
smiling
 
"
and
reason
good
.
<EOS>
I
was
sixteen
years
old
when
you
were
born
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
material
difference
then
,
"
she
replied
 
"
and
no
doubt
you
were
much
my
superior
in
judgment
at
that
period
of
our
lives
;
but
does
not
the
lapse
of
one
-
and
-
twenty
years
bring
our
understandings
a
good
deal
nearer
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Yes
 
a
good
deal
_
nearer
_
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
But
still
,
not
near
enough
to
give
me
a
chance
of
being
right
,
if
we
think
differently
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
still
the
advantage
of
you
by
sixteen
years
'
experience
,
and
by
not
being
a
pretty
young
woman
and
a
spoiled
child
.
<EOS>
Come
,
my
dear
Emma
,
let
us
be
friends
,
and
say
no
more
about
it
.
<EOS>
Tell
your
aunt
,
little
Emma
,
that
she
ought
to
set
you
a
better
example
than
to
be
renewing
old
grievances
,
and
that
if
she
were
not
wrong
before
,
she
is
now
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
true
,
"
she
cried
 
"
very
true
.
<EOS>
Little
Emma
,
grow
up
a
better
woman
than
your
aunt
.
<EOS>
Be
infinitely
cleverer
and
not
half
so
conceited
.
<EOS>
Now
,
Mr.
Knightley
,
a
word
or
two
more
,
and
I
have
done
.
<EOS>
As
far
as
good
intentions
went
,
we
were
_
<EOS>
both
_
right
,
<EOS>
and
I
must
say
that
no
effects
on
my
side
of
the
argument
have
yet
proved
wrong
.
<EOS>
I
only
want
to
know
that
Mr.
Martin
is
not
very
,
very
bitterly
disappointed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
man
can
not
be
more
so
,
"
was
his
short
,
full
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
 
<EOS>
Indeed
I
am
very
sorry
.
 
<EOS>
Come
,
shake
hands
with
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
This
had
just
taken
place
and
with
great
cordiality
,
when
John
Knightley
made
his
appearance
,
and
"
How
d'ye
do
,
George
?
"
and
"
John
,
how
are
you
?
<EOS>
"
succeeded
in
the
true
English
style
,
burying
under
a
calmness
that
seemed
all
but
indifference
,
the
real
attachment
which
would
have
led
either
of
them
,
if
requisite
,
to
do
every
thing
for
the
good
of
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
The
evening
was
quiet
and
conversable
,
as
Mr.
Woodhouse
declined
cards
entirely
for
the
sake
of
comfortable
talk
with
his
dear
Isabella
,
and
the
little
party
made
two
natural
divisions
;
on
one
side
<EOS>
he
and
his
daughter
;
on
the
other
the
two
Mr.
Knightleys
;
their
subjects
totally
distinct
,
or
very
rarely
mixing
 
and
Emma
only
occasionally
joining
in
one
or
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
The
brothers
talked
of
their
own
concerns
and
pursuits
,
but
principally
of
those
of
the
elder
,
whose
temper
was
by
much
the
most
communicative
,
and
who
was
always
the
greater
talker
.
<EOS>
As
a
magistrate
,
he
had
generally
some
point
of
law
to
consult
John
about
,
or
,
at
least
,
some
curious
anecdote
to
give
;
and
as
a
farmer
,
as
keeping
in
hand
the
home
-
farm
at
Donwell
,
he
had
to
tell
what
every
field
was
to
bear
next
year
,
and
to
give
all
such
local
information
as
could
not
fail
of
being
interesting
to
a
brother
whose
home
it
had
equally
been
the
longest
part
of
his
life
,
and
whose
attachments
were
strong
.
<EOS>
The
plan
of
a
drain
,
the
change
of
a
fence
,
the
felling
of
a
tree
,
and
the
destination
of
every
acre
for
wheat
,
turnips
,
or
spring
corn
,
was
entered
into
with
as
much
equality
of
interest
by
John
,
as
his
cooler
manners
rendered
possible
;
and
if
his
willing
brother
ever
left
him
any
thing
to
inquire
about
,
his
inquiries
even
approached
a
tone
of
eagerness
.
  
<EOS>
While
they
were
thus
comfortably
occupied
,
Mr.
Woodhouse
was
enjoying
a
full
flow
of
happy
regrets
and
fearful
affection
with
his
daughter
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
poor
dear
Isabella
,
"
said
he
,
fondly
taking
her
hand
,
and
interrupting
,
for
a
few
moments
,
<EOS>
her
busy
labours
for
some
one
of
her
five
children
 
<EOS>
"
How
long
it
is
,
how
terribly
long
since
you
were
here
!
<EOS>
And
how
tired
you
must
be
after
your
journey
!
<EOS>
You
must
go
to
bed
early
,
my
dear
 
<EOS>
and
I
recommend
a
little
gruel
to
you
before
you
go
.
 
<EOS>
You
and
I
will
have
a
nice
basin
of
gruel
together
.
<EOS>
My
dear
Emma
,
suppose
we
all
have
a
little
gruel
.
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
could
not
suppose
any
such
thing
,
knowing
as
she
did
,
that
both
the
Mr.
Knightleys
were
as
unpersuadable
on
that
article
as
herself
;
 
and
two
basins
only
were
ordered
.
<EOS>
After
a
little
more
discourse
in
praise
of
gruel
,
with
some
wondering
at
its
not
being
taken
every
evening
by
every
body
,
he
proceeded
to
say
,
with
an
air
of
grave
reflection
,
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
an
awkward
business
,
my
dear
,
your
spending
the
autumn
at
South
End
instead
of
coming
here
.
<EOS>
I
never
had
much
opinion
of
the
sea
air
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Mr.
Wingfield
most
strenuously
recommended
it
,
sir
 
or
we
should
not
have
gone
.
<EOS>
He
recommended
it
for
all
the
children
,
but
particularly
for
the
weakness
in
little
Bella
's
throat
,
 
both
sea
air
and
bathing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
my
dear
,
but
<EOS>
Perry
had
many
doubts
about
the
sea
doing
her
any
good
;
and
as
to
myself
,
I
have
been
long
perfectly
convinced
,
though
perhaps
I
never
told
you
so
before
,
that
the
sea
is
very
rarely
of
use
to
any
body
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
it
almost
killed
me
once
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Come
,
come
,
"
cried
Emma
,
feeling
this
to
be
an
unsafe
subject
,
"
I
must
beg
you
not
to
talk
of
the
sea
.
<EOS>
It
makes
me
envious
and
miserable
;
 
I
who
have
never
seen
it
!
<EOS>
South
End
is
prohibited
,
if
you
please

<EOS>
My
dear
Isabella
,
I
have
not
heard
you
make
one
inquiry
about
Mr.
Perry
yet
;
and
he
never
forgets
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
good
Mr.
Perry
 
<EOS>
how
is
he
,
sir
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
pretty
well
;
<EOS>
but
not
quite
well
.
<EOS>
Poor
Perry
is
bilious
,
and
he
has
not
time
to
take
care
of
himself
 
<EOS>
he
tells
me
he
has
not
time
to
take
care
of
himself
 
which
is
very
sad
 
<EOS>
but
he
is
always
wanted
all
round
the
country
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
there
is
not
a
man
in
such
practice
anywhere
.
<EOS>
But
then
there
is
not
so
clever
a
man
any
where
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
Mrs.
Perry
and
the
children
<EOS>
,
how
are
they
?
<EOS>
do
the
children
grow
?
<EOS>
I
have
a
great
regard
for
Mr.
Perry
.
<EOS>
I
hope
he
will
be
calling
soon
.
<EOS>
He
will
be
so
pleased
to
see
my
little
ones
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
he
will
be
here
to
-
morrow
,
for
I
have
a
question
or
two
to
ask
him
about
myself
of
some
consequence
.
<EOS>
And
,
my
dear
,
whenever
he
comes
,
you
had
better
let
him
look
at
little
Bella
's
throat
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
my
dear
sir
,
her
throat
is
so
much
better
that
I
have
hardly
any
uneasiness
about
it
.
<EOS>
Either
bathing
has
been
of
the
greatest
service
to
her
,
or
else
it
is
to
be
attributed
to
an
excellent
embrocation
of
Mr.
Wingfield
's
,
which
we
have
been
applying
at
times
ever
since
August
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
very
likely
,
my
dear
,
that
bathing
should
have
been
of
use
to
her
 
<EOS>
and
if
I
had
known
you
were
wanting
an
embrocation
<EOS>
,
I
would
have
spoken
to
    
<EOS>
"
You
seem
to
me
to
have
forgotten
Mrs.
and
Miss
Bates
,
"
said
Emma
,
"
I
have
not
heard
one
inquiry
after
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Oh
!
<EOS>
the
good
Bateses
 
<EOS>
I
am
quite
ashamed
of
myself
 
<EOS>
but
you
mention
them
in
most
of
your
letters
.
<EOS>
I
hope
they
are
quite
well
.
<EOS>
Good
old
Mrs.
Bates
 
<EOS>
I
will
call
upon
her
to
-
morrow
,
and
take
my
children
.
 
<EOS>
They
are
always
so
pleased
to
see
my
children
.
 
<EOS>
And
that
excellent
Miss
Bates
!
 
<EOS>
such
thorough
worthy
people
!
 
<EOS>
How
are
they
,
sir
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
pretty
well
,
my
dear
,
upon
the
whole
.
<EOS>
But
poor
Mrs.
Bates
had
a
bad
cold
about
a
month
ago
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
sorry
I
am
!
<EOS>
But
colds
were
never
so
prevalent
as
they
have
been
this
autumn
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Wingfield
told
me
that
he
has
never
known
them
more
general
or
heavy
 
except
when
it
has
been
quite
an
influenza
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
has
been
a
good
deal
the
case
,
my
dear
;
but
not
to
the
degree
you
mention
.
<EOS>
Perry
says
that
colds
have
been
very
general
,
but
not
so
heavy
as
he
has
very
often
known
them
in
November
.
<EOS>
Perry
does
not
call
it
altogether
a
sickly
season
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
do
not
know
that
Mr.
Wingfield
considers
<EOS>
it
_
very
_
<EOS>
sickly
except
    
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
my
poor
dear
child
,
the
truth
is
,
that
in
London
it
is
always
a
sickly
season
.
<EOS>
Nobody
is
healthy
in
London
,
nobody
can
be
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
dreadful
thing
to
have
you
forced
to
live
there
!
<EOS>
so
far
off
!
 
<EOS>
and
the
air
so
bad
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
indeed
 
_
we
_
are
not
at
all
in
a
bad
air
.
<EOS>
Our
part
of
London
is
very
superior
to
most
others
!
 
<EOS>
You
must
not
confound
us
with
London
in
general
,
my
dear
sir
.
<EOS>
The
neighbourhood
of
Brunswick
Square
is
very
different
from
almost
all
the
rest
.
<EOS>
We
are
so
very
airy
!
<EOS>
I
should
be
unwilling
,
I
own
,
to
live
in
any
other
part
of
the
town
;
 
there
is
hardly
any
other
that
I
could
be
satisfied
to
have
my
children
in
:
but
_
we
_
are
so
remarkably
airy
!
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Wingfield
thinks
the
vicinity
of
Brunswick
Square
decidedly
the
most
favourable
as
to
air
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
my
dear
,
it
is
not
like
Hartfield
.
<EOS>
You
make
the
best
of
it
 
<EOS>
but
after
you
have
been
a
week
at
Hartfield
,
you
are
all
of
you
different
creatures
;
you
do
not
look
like
the
same
.
<EOS>
Now
I
can
not
say
,
that
I
think
you
are
any
of
you
looking
well
at
present
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
to
hear
you
say
so
,
sir
;
but
I
assure
you
,
excepting
those
little
nervous
head
-
aches
and
palpitations
which
I
am
never
entirely
free
from
anywhere
<EOS>
,
I
am
quite
well
myself
;
and
if
the
children
were
rather
pale
before
they
went
to
bed
,
it
was
only
because
they
were
a
little
more
tired
than
usual
,
from
their
journey
and
the
happiness
of
coming
.
<EOS>
I
hope
you
will
think
better
of
their
looks
to
-
morrow
;
for
I
assure
you
Mr.
Wingfield
told
me
,
that
he
did
not
believe
he
had
ever
sent
us
off
altogether
,
in
such
good
case
.
<EOS>
I
trust
,
at
least
,
that
you
do
not
think
Mr.
Knightley
looking
ill
,
"
turning
her
eyes
with
affectionate
anxiety
towards
her
husband
.
  
<EOS>
"
Middling
,
my
dear
;
I
can
not
compliment
you
.
<EOS>
I
think
Mr.
John
Knightley
very
far
from
looking
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
the
matter
,
sir
?
 
<EOS>
Did
you
speak
to
me
?
"
cried
Mr.
John
Knightley
,
hearing
his
own
name
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
to
find
,
my
love
,
that
my
father
does
not
think
you
looking
well
 
<EOS>
but
I
hope
it
is
only
from
being
a
little
fatigued
.
<EOS>
I
could
have
wished
,
however
,
as
you
know
,
that
you
had
seen
Mr.
Wingfield
before
you
left
home
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Isabella
,
"
 
exclaimed
he
hastily
 
"
pray
do
not
concern
yourself
about
my
looks
.
<EOS>
Be
satisfied
with
doctoring
and
coddling
yourself
and
the
children
,
and
let
me
look
as
I
chuse
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
not
thoroughly
understand
what
you
were
telling
your
brother
,
"
cried
Emma
,
"
about
your
friend
Mr.
Graham
's
intending
to
have
a
bailiff
from
Scotland
,
to
look
after
his
new
estate
.
<EOS>
What
will
it
answer
?
<EOS>
Will
not
the
old
prejudice
be
too
strong
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
she
talked
in
this
way
so
long
and
successfully
that
,
when
forced
to
give
her
attention
again
to
her
father
and
sister
,
she
had
nothing
worse
to
hear
than
Isabella
's
kind
inquiry
after
Jane
Fairfax
;
and
<EOS>
Jane
Fairfax
,
though
no
great
favourite
with
her
in
general
,
she
was
at
that
moment
very
happy
to
assist
in
praising
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
sweet
,
amiable
Jane
Fairfax
!
"
said
Mrs.
John
Knightley
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
so
long
since
I
have
seen
her
,
except
now
and
then
for
a
moment
accidentally
in
town
!
<EOS>
What
happiness
it
must
be
to
her
good
old
grandmother
and
excellent
aunt
,
when
she
comes
to
visit
them
!
<EOS>
I
always
regret
excessively
on
dear
Emma
's
account
that
she
can
not
be
more
at
Highbury
;
but
now
their
daughter
is
married
,
I
suppose
Colonel
and
Mrs.
Campbell
will
not
be
able
to
part
with
her
at
all
.
<EOS>
She
would
be
such
a
delightful
companion
for
Emma
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Woodhouse
agreed
to
it
all
,
but
added
,
  
"
Our
little
friend
Harriet
Smith
,
however
,
is
just
such
another
pretty
kind
of
young
person
.
<EOS>
You
will
like
Harriet
.
<EOS>
Emma
could
not
have
a
better
companion
than
Harriet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
most
happy
to
hear
it
 
but
<EOS>
only
Jane
Fairfax
one
knows
to
be
so
very
accomplished
and
superior
!
 
<EOS>
and
exactly
Emma
's
age
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
topic
was
discussed
very
happily
,
and
others
succeeded
of
similar
moment
,
and
passed
away
with
similar
harmony
;
but
the
evening
did
not
close
without
a
little
return
of
agitation
.
<EOS>
The
gruel
came
and
supplied
a
great
deal
to
be
said
 
much
praise
and
many
comments
 
<EOS>
undoubting
decision
of
its
wholesomeness
for
every
constitution
,
and
pretty
severe
Philippics
upon
the
many
houses
where
it
was
never
met
with
tolerable
;
 
but
,
unfortunately
,
among
the
failures
which
the
daughter
had
to
instance
,
the
most
recent
,
and
therefore
most
prominent
,
was
in
her
own
cook
at
South
End
,
a
young
woman
hired
for
the
time
,
who
never
had
been
able
to
understand
what
she
meant
by
a
basin
of
nice
smooth
gruel
,
thin
,
but
not
too
thin
.
<EOS>
Often
as
she
had
wished
for
and
ordered
it
,
she
had
never
been
able
to
get
any
thing
tolerable
.
<EOS>
Here
was
a
dangerous
opening
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
said
Mr.
Woodhouse
,
shaking
his
head
and
fixing
his
eyes
on
her
with
tender
concern
.
 
<EOS>
The
ejaculation
in
Emma
's
ear
expressed
,
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
there
is
no
end
of
the
sad
consequences
of
your
going
to
South
End
.
<EOS>
It
does
not
bear
talking
of
.
"
<EOS>
And
for
a
little
while
she
hoped
he
would
not
talk
of
it
,
and
that
a
silent
rumination
might
suffice
to
restore
him
to
the
relish
of
his
own
smooth
gruel
.
<EOS>
After
an
interval
of
some
minutes
,
however
,
he
began
with
,
  
"
I
shall
always
be
very
sorry
that
you
went
to
the
sea
this
autumn
,
instead
of
coming
here
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
why
should
you
be
sorry
,
sir
?
 
<EOS>
I
assure
you
,
it
did
the
children
a
great
deal
of
good
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
,
moreover
,
if
you
must
go
to
the
sea
,
it
had
better
not
have
been
to
South
End
.
<EOS>
South
End
is
an
unhealthy
place
.
<EOS>
Perry
was
surprized
to
hear
you
had
fixed
upon
South
End
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
there
is
such
an
idea
with
many
people
,
but
indeed
it
is
quite
a
mistake
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
We
all
had
our
health
perfectly
well
there
,
never
found
the
least
inconvenience
from
the
mud
;
and
Mr.
Wingfield
says
it
is
entirely
a
mistake
to
suppose
the
place
unhealthy
;
and
I
am
sure
he
may
be
depended
on
,
for
he
thoroughly
understands
the
nature
of
the
air
,
and
his
own
brother
and
family
have
been
there
repeatedly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
should
have
gone
to
Cromer
,
my
dear
,
if
you
went
anywhere
.
 
<EOS>
Perry
was
a
week
at
Cromer
once
,
and
he
holds
it
to
be
the
best
of
all
the
sea
-
bathing
places
.
<EOS>
A
fine
open
sea
,
he
says
,
and
very
pure
air
.
<EOS>
And
,
by
what
I
understand
,
you
might
have
had
lodgings
there
quite
away
from
the
sea
 
a
quarter
of
a
mile
off
 
very
comfortable
.
<EOS>
You
should
have
consulted
Perry
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
my
dear
sir
,
the
difference
of
the
journey
;
 
only
consider
how
great
it
would
have
been
.
 
<EOS>
An
hundred
miles
,
perhaps
,
instead
of
forty
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
my
dear
,
as
Perry
says
,
where
health
is
at
stake
,
nothing
else
should
be
considered
;
and
if
one
is
to
travel
,
there
is
not
much
to
chuse
between
forty
miles
and
an
hundred
.
 
<EOS>
Better
not
move
at
all
,
better
stay
in
London
altogether
than
travel
forty
miles
to
get
into
a
worse
air
.
<EOS>
This
is
just
what
Perry
said
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
to
him
a
very
ill
-
judged
measure
.
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
's
attempts
to
stop
her
father
had
been
vain
;
and
when
he
had
reached
such
a
point
as
this
,
she
could
not
wonder
at
her
brother
-
in
-
law
's
breaking
out
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Perry
,
"
said
he
,
in
a
voice
of
very
strong
displeasure
,
"
would
do
as
well
to
keep
his
opinion
till
it
is
asked
for
.
<EOS>
Why
does
he
make
it
any
business
of
his
,
to
wonder
at
what
I
do
?
 
<EOS>
at
my
taking
my
family
to
one
part
of
the
coast
or
another
?
 
<EOS>
I
may
be
allowed
,
I
hope
,
the
use
of
my
judgment
as
well
as
Mr.
Perry
.
 
<EOS>
I
want
his
directions
no
more
than
his
drugs
.
"
<EOS>
He
paused
 
and
growing
cooler
in
a
moment
,
added
,
with
only
sarcastic
dryness
,
"
If
Mr.
Perry
can
tell
me
how
to
convey
a
wife
and
five
children
a
distance
of
an
hundred
and
thirty
miles
with
no
greater
expense
or
inconvenience
than
a
distance
of
forty
,
I
should
be
as
willing
to
prefer
Cromer
to
South
End
as
he
could
himself
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
True
,
true
,
"
cried
Mr.
Knightley
,
with
most
ready
interposition
 
"
very
true
.
<EOS>
That
's
a
consideration
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
But
John
,
as
to
what
I
was
telling
you
of
my
idea
of
moving
the
path
to
Langham
,
of
turning
it
more
to
the
right
that
it
may
not
cut
through
the
home
meadows
,
I
can
not
conceive
any
difficulty
.
<EOS>
I
should
not
attempt
it
,
if
it
were
to
be
the
means
of
inconvenience
to
the
Highbury
people
,
but
if
you
call
to
mind
exactly
the
present
line
of
the
path
....
<EOS>
The
only
way
of
proving
it
,
however
,
will
be
to
turn
to
our
maps
.
<EOS>
I
shall
see
you
at
the
Abbey
to
-
morrow
morning
<EOS>
I
hope
,
and
then
we
will
look
them
over

you
shall
give
me
your
opinion

Mr.
Woodhouse
was
rather
agitated
by
such
harsh
reflections
on
his
friend
Perry
,
<EOS>
to
whom
he
had
,
in
fact
,
though
unconsciously
,
been
attributing
many
of
his
own
feelings
and
expressions
;
 
but
the
soothing
attentions
of
his
daughters
gradually
removed
the
present
evil
,
and
the
immediate
alertness
of
one
brother
,
and
better
recollections
of
the
other
,
prevented
any
renewal
of
it
.
    
<EOS>
There
could
hardly
be
a
happier
creature
in
the
world
than
Mrs.
John
Knightley
,
in
this
short
visit
to
Hartfield
,
going
about
every
morning
among
her
old
acquaintance
with
her
five
children
,
and
talking
over
what
she
had
done
every
evening
with
her
father
and
sister
.
<EOS>
She
had
nothing
to
wish
otherwise
,
but
that
the
days
did
not
pass
so
swiftly
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
delightful
visit
;
 
perfect
,
in
being
much
too
short
.
  
<EOS>
In
general
their
evenings
were
less
engaged
with
friends
than
their
mornings
;
but
one
complete
dinner
engagement
,
and
out
of
the
house
too
,
there
was
no
avoiding
,
though
at
Christmas
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Weston
would
take
no
denial
;
they
must
all
dine
at
Randalls
one
day
;
 
<EOS>
even
Mr.
Woodhouse
was
persuaded
to
think
it
a
possible
thing
in
preference
to
a
division
of
the
party
.
  
<EOS>
How
they
were
all
to
be
conveyed
,
he
would
have
made
a
difficulty
if
he
could
,
but
as
his
son
and
daughter
's
carriage
and
horses
were
actually
at
Hartfield
,
he
was
not
able
to
make
more
than
a
simple
question
on
that
head
;
it
hardly
amounted
to
a
doubt
;
nor
did
it
occupy
Emma
long
to
convince
him
that
they
might
in
one
of
the
carriages
find
room
for
Harriet
also
.
  
<EOS>
Harriet
,
Mr.
Elton
,
and
Mr.
Knightley
,
their
own
especial
set
,
were
the
only
persons
invited
to
meet
them
;
 
the
hours
were
to
be
early
,
as
well
as
the
numbers
few
;
Mr.
Woodhouse
's
habits
and
inclination
being
consulted
in
every
thing
.
  
<EOS>
The
evening
before
this
great
event
(
for
it
was
a
very
great
event
that
Mr.
Woodhouse
should
dine
out
,
on
the
24th
of
December
)
<EOS>
had
been
spent
by
Harriet
at
Hartfield
,
and
she
had
gone
home
so
much
indisposed
with
a
cold
,
that
,
but
for
her
own
earnest
wish
of
being
nursed
by
Mrs.
Goddard
,
Emma
could
not
have
allowed
her
to
leave
the
house
.
<EOS>
Emma
called
on
her
the
next
day
,
and
found
her
doom
already
signed
with
regard
to
Randalls
.
<EOS>
She
was
very
feverish
and
had
a
bad
sore
throat
:
<EOS>
Mrs.
Goddard
was
full
of
care
and
affection
,
Mr.
Perry
was
talked
of
,
and
Harriet
herself
was
too
ill
and
low
to
resist
the
authority
which
excluded
her
from
this
delightful
engagement
,
though
she
could
not
speak
of
her
loss
without
many
tears
.
  
<EOS>
Emma
sat
with
her
as
long
as
she
could
,
to
attend
her
in
Mrs.
Goddard
's
unavoidable
absences
,
and
raise
her
spirits
by
representing
how
much
Mr.
Elton
's
would
be
depressed
when
he
knew
her
state
;
and
left
her
at
last
tolerably
comfortable
,
in
the
sweet
dependence
of
his
having
a
most
comfortless
visit
,
and
of
their
all
missing
her
very
much
.
<EOS>
She
had
not
advanced
many
yards
from
Mrs.
Goddard
's
door
,
when
she
was
met
by
Mr.
Elton
himself
,
evidently
coming
towards
it
,
and
as
they
walked
on
slowly
together
in
conversation
about
the
invalid
 
of
whom
he
,
on
the
rumour
of
considerable
illness
,
had
been
going
to
inquire
,
that
he
might
carry
some
report
of
her
to
Hartfield
 
<EOS>
they
were
overtaken
by
Mr.
John
Knightley
returning
from
the
daily
visit
to
Donwell
,
with
his
two
eldest
boys
,
whose
healthy
,
glowing
faces
shewed
all
the
benefit
of
a
country
run
,
and
seemed
to
ensure
a
quick
despatch
of
the
roast
mutton
and
rice
pudding
they
were
hastening
home
for
.
<EOS>
They
joined
company
and
proceeded
together
.
<EOS>
Emma
was
just
describing
the
nature
of
her
friend
's
complaint
;
 
"
a
throat
very
much
inflamed
,
with
a
great
deal
of
heat
about
her
,
a
quick
,
low
pulse
,
&
c.
<EOS>
and
she
was
sorry
to
find
from
Mrs.
Goddard
that
Harriet
was
liable
to
very
bad
sore
-
throats
,
and
had
often
alarmed
her
with
them
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Elton
looked
all
alarm
on
the
occasion
,
as
he
exclaimed
,
  
"
A
sore
-
throat
!
 
<EOS>
I
hope
not
infectious
.
<EOS>
I
hope
not
of
a
putrid
infectious
sort
.
<EOS>
Has
Perry
seen
her
?
<EOS>
Indeed
you
should
take
care
of
yourself
as
well
as
of
your
friend
.
<EOS>
Let
me
entreat
you
to
run
no
risks
.
<EOS>
Why
does
not
Perry
see
her
?
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
,
who
was
not
really
at
all
frightened
herself
,
tranquillised
this
excess
of
apprehension
by
assurances
of
Mrs.
Goddard
's
experience
and
care
;
but
as
there
must
still
remain
a
degree
of
uneasiness
which
she
could
not
wish
to
reason
away
,
which
she
would
rather
feed
and
assist
than
not
,
she
added
soon
afterwards
 
as
if
quite
another
subject
,
  
"
It
is
so
cold
,
so
very
cold
 
and
looks
and
feels
so
very
much
like
snow
,
that
if
it
were
to
any
other
place
or
with
any
other
party
,
I
should
really
try
not
to
go
out
to
-
day
 
and
dissuade
my
father
from
venturing
;
but
as
he
has
made
up
his
mind
,
and
does
not
seem
to
feel
the
cold
himself
,
I
do
not
like
to
interfere
,
as
I
know
it
would
be
so
great
a
disappointment
to
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Weston
.
<EOS>
But
,
upon
my
word
,
Mr.
Elton
,
in
your
case
,
I
should
certainly
excuse
myself
.
<EOS>
You
appear
to
me
a
little
hoarse
already
,
and
when
you
consider
what
demand
of
voice
and
what
fatigues
to
-
morrow
will
bring
,
I
think
it
would
be
no
more
than
common
prudence
to
stay
at
home
and
take
care
of
yourself
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Elton
looked
as
if
he
did
not
very
well
know
what
answer
to
make
;
which
was
exactly
the
case
;
for
though
very
much
gratified
by
the
kind
care
of
such
a
fair
lady
,
and
not
liking
to
resist
any
advice
of
her
's
,
he
had
not
really
the
least
inclination
to
give
up
the
visit
;
 
but
Emma
,
too
eager
and
busy
in
her
own
previous
conceptions
and
views
to
hear
him
impartially
,
or
see
him
with
clear
vision
,
was
very
well
satisfied
with
his
muttering
acknowledgment
of
its
being
"
very
cold
,
certainly
very
cold
,
"
and
walked
on
,
rejoicing
in
having
extricated
him
from
Randalls
,
and
secured
him
the
power
of
sending
to
inquire
after
Harriet
every
hour
of
the
evening
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
quite
right
,
"
said
she
;
 
"
we
will
make
your
apologies
to
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Weston
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
But
hardly
had
she
so
spoken
,
when
she
found
her
brother
was
civilly
offering
a
seat
in
his
carriage
,
if
the
weather
were
Mr.
Elton
's
only
objection
,
and
Mr.
Elton
actually
accepting
the
offer
with
much
prompt
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
done
thing
;
Mr.
Elton
was
to
go
,
and
never
had
his
broad
handsome
face
expressed
more
pleasure
than
at
this
moment
;
never
had
his
smile
been
stronger
,
nor
his
eyes
more
exulting
than
when
he
next
looked
at
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
said
she
to
herself
,
"
this
is
most
strange
!
 
<EOS>
After
I
had
got
him
off
so
well
,
to
chuse
to
go
into
company
,
and
leave
Harriet
ill
behind
!
 
<EOS>
Most
strange
indeed
!
 
<EOS>
But
there
is
,
I
believe
,
in
many
men
,
especially
single
men
,
<EOS>
such
an
inclination
 
<EOS>
such
a
passion
for
dining
out
 
a
dinner
engagement
is
so
high
in
the
class
of
their
pleasures
,
their
employments
,
their
dignities
,
almost
their
duties
,
that
any
thing
gives
way
to
it
 
<EOS>
and
this
must
be
the
case
with
Mr.
Elton
;
<EOS>
a
most
valuable
,
amiable
,
pleasing
young
man
undoubtedly
,
and
very
much
in
love
with
Harriet
;
but
still
,
he
can
not
refuse
an
invitation
,
he
must
dine
out
wherever
he
is
asked
.
<EOS>
What
a
strange
thing
love
is
!
<EOS>
he
can
see
ready
wit
in
Harriet
,
but
will
not
dine
alone
for
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
Soon
afterwards
Mr.
Elton
quitted
them
,
and
she
could
not
but
do
him
the
justice
of
feeling
that
there
was
a
great
deal
of
sentiment
in
his
manner
of
naming
Harriet
at
parting
;
in
the
tone
of
his
voice
while
assuring
her
that
he
should
call
at
Mrs.
Goddard
's
for
news
of
her
fair
friend
,
the
last
thing
before
he
prepared
for
the
happiness
of
meeting
her
again
,
when
he
hoped
to
be
able
to
give
a
better
report
;
and
he
sighed
and
smiled
himself
off
in
a
way
that
left
the
balance
of
approbation
much
in
his
favour
.
  
<EOS>
After
a
few
minutes
of
entire
silence
between
them
,
John
Knightley
began
with
    
"
I
never
in
my
life
saw
a
man
more
intent
on
being
agreeable
than
Mr.
Elton
.
<EOS>
It
is
downright
labour
to
him
where
ladies
are
concerned
.
<EOS>
With
men
he
can
be
rational
and
unaffected
,
but
when
he
has
ladies
to
please
,
every
feature
works
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Mr.
Elton
's
manners
are
not
perfect
,
"
replied
Emma
;
"
but
where
there
is
a
wish
to
please
,
one
ought
to
overlook
,
and
one
does
overlook
a
great
deal
.
<EOS>
Where
a
man
does
his
best
with
only
moderate
powers
,
he
will
have
the
advantage
over
negligent
superiority
.
<EOS>
There
is
such
perfect
good
-
temper
and
good
-
will
in
Mr.
Elton
as
one
can
not
but
value
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Mr.
John
Knightley
presently
,
with
some
slyness
,
"
he
seems
to
have
a
great
deal
of
good
-
will
towards
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Me
!
"
<EOS>
she
replied
with
a
smile
of
astonishment
,
"
are
you
imagining
me
to
be
Mr.
Elton
's
object
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Such
an
imagination
has
crossed
me
,
I
own
,
Emma
;
and
if
it
never
occurred
to
you
before
,
you
may
as
well
take
it
into
consideration
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Mr.
Elton
in
love
with
me
!
 
<EOS>
What
an
idea
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
say
it
is
so
;
but
you
will
do
well
to
consider
whether
it
is
so
or
not
,
and
to
regulate
your
behaviour
accordingly
.
<EOS>
I
think
your
manners
to
him
encouraging
.
<EOS>
I
speak
as
a
friend
,
Emma
.
<EOS>
You
had
better
look
about
you
,
and
ascertain
what
you
do
,
and
what
you
mean
to
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
thank
you
;
but
I
assure
you
you
are
quite
mistaken
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Elton
and
I
are
very
good
friends
,
and
nothing
more
;
"
and
she
walked
on
,
amusing
herself
in
the
consideration
of
the
blunders
which
often
arise
from
a
partial
knowledge
of
circumstances
,
of
the
mistakes
which
people
of
high
pretensions
to
judgment
are
for
ever
falling
into
;
and
not
very
well
pleased
with
her
brother
for
imagining
her
blind
and
ignorant
,
and
in
want
of
counsel
.
<EOS>
He
said
no
more
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Woodhouse
had
so
completely
made
up
his
mind
to
the
visit
,
that
in
spite
of
the
increasing
coldness
,
he
seemed
to
have
no
idea
of
shrinking
from
it
,
and
set
forward
at
last
most
punctually
with
his
eldest
daughter
in
his
own
carriage
,
with
less
apparent
consciousness
of
the
weather
than
either
of
the
others
;
too
full
of
the
wonder
of
his
own
going
,
and
the
pleasure
it
was
to
afford
at
Randalls
to
see
that
it
was
cold
,
and
too
well
wrapt
up
to
feel
it
.
<EOS>
The
cold
,
however
,
was
severe
;
and
by
the
time
the
second
carriage
was
in
motion
,
a
few
flakes
of
snow
were
finding
their
way
down
,
and
the
sky
had
the
appearance
of
being
so
overcharged
as
to
want
only
a
milder
air
to
produce
a
very
white
world
in
a
very
short
time
.
  
<EOS>
Emma
soon
saw
that
her
companion
was
not
in
the
happiest
humour
.
<EOS>
The
preparing
and
the
going
abroad
in
such
weather
,
with
the
sacrifice
of
his
children
after
dinner
,
were
evils
,
were
disagreeables
at
least
,
which
Mr.
John
Knightley
did
not
by
any
means
like
;
he
anticipated
nothing
in
the
visit
that
could
be
at
all
worth
the
purchase
;
and
the
whole
of
their
drive
to
the
vicarage
was
spent
by
him
in
expressing
his
discontent
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
man
,
"
said
he
,
"
must
have
a
very
good
opinion
of
himself
when
he
asks
people
to
leave
their
own
fireside
,
and
encounter
such
a
day
as
this
,
for
the
sake
of
coming
to
see
him
.
<EOS>
He
must
think
himself
a
most
agreeable
fellow
;
I
could
not
do
such
a
thing
.
<EOS>
It
is
the
greatest
absurdity
 
Actually
snowing
at
this
moment
!
 
<EOS>
The
folly
of
not
allowing
people
to
be
comfortable
at
home
 
and
the
folly
of
people
's
not
staying
comfortably
at
home
when
they
can
!
<EOS>
If
we
were
obliged
to
go
out
such
an
evening
as
this
,
by
any
call
of
duty
or
business
,
what
a
hardship
we
should
deem
it
;
 
and
here
are
we
,
probably
with
rather
thinner
clothing
than
usual
,
setting
forward
voluntarily
,
without
excuse
,
in
defiance
of
the
voice
of
nature
,
which
tells
man
,
in
every
thing
given
to
his
view
or
his
feelings
,
to
stay
at
home
himself
,
and
keep
all
under
shelter
that
he
can
;
 
here
are
we
setting
forward
to
spend
five
dull
hours
in
another
man
's
house
,
with
nothing
to
say
or
to
hear
that
was
not
said
and
heard
yesterday
,
and
may
not
be
said
and
heard
again
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
Going
in
dismal
weather
,
to
return
probably
in
worse
;
 
four
horses
and
four
servants
taken
out
for
nothing
but
to
convey
five
idle
,
shivering
creatures
into
colder
rooms
and
worse
company
than
they
might
have
had
at
home
.
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
did
not
find
herself
equal
to
give
the
pleased
assent
,
which
no
doubt
he
was
in
the
habit
of
receiving
,
to
emulate
the
"
Very
true
,
my
love
,
"
which
must
have
been
usually
administered
by
his
travelling
companion
;
but
she
had
resolution
enough
to
refrain
from
making
any
answer
at
all
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
be
complying
,
she
dreaded
being
quarrelsome
;
her
heroism
reached
only
to
silence
.
<EOS>
She
allowed
him
to
talk
,
and
arranged
the
glasses
,
and
wrapped
herself
up
,
without
opening
her
lips
.
  
<EOS>
They
arrived
,
the
carriage
turned
,
the
step
was
let
down
,
and
Mr.
Elton
,
spruce
,
black
,
and
smiling
,
was
with
them
instantly
.
<EOS>
Emma
thought
with
pleasure
of
some
change
of
subject
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Elton
was
all
obligation
and
cheerfulness
;
he
was
so
very
cheerful
in
his
civilities
indeed
,
that
she
began
to
think
he
must
have
received
a
different
account
of
Harriet
from
what
had
reached
her
.
<EOS>
She
had
sent
while
dressing
,
and
the
answer
had
been
,
"
<EOS>
Much
the
same
 
not
better
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
_
My
_
report
from
Mrs.
Goddard
's
,
"
said
she
presently
,
"
was
not
so
pleasant
as
I
had
hoped
 
"
Not
better
<EOS>
"
was
_
my
_
answer
.
"
  
<EOS>
His
face
lengthened
immediately
;
and
his
voice
was
the
voice
of
sentiment
as
he
answered
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
no
 
<EOS>
I
am
grieved
to
find
 
<EOS>
I
was
on
the
point
of
telling
you
that
when
I
called
at
Mrs.
Goddard
's
door
,
which
I
did
the
very
last
thing
before
I
returned
to
dress
,
I
was
told
that
Miss
Smith
was
not
better
,
by
no
means
better
,
rather
worse
.
<EOS>
Very
much
grieved
and
concerned
 
<EOS>
I
had
flattered
myself
that
she
must
be
better
after
such
a
cordial
as
I
knew
had
been
given
her
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
smiled
and
answered
 
"
My
visit
was
of
use
to
the
nervous
part
of
her
complaint
,
I
hope
;
but
not
even
I
can
charm
away
a
sore
throat
;
it
is
a
most
severe
cold
indeed
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Perry
has
been
with
her
,
as
you
probably
heard
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
 
I
imagined
 
<EOS>
that
is
 
I
did
not
 
"
  
"
He
has
been
used
to
her
in
these
complaints
,
and
I
hope
to
-
morrow
morning
will
bring
us
both
a
more
comfortable
report
.
<EOS>
But
it
is
impossible
not
to
feel
uneasiness
.
<EOS>
Such
a
sad
loss
to
our
party
to
-
day
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Dreadful
!
 
<EOS>
Exactly
so
,
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
She
will
be
missed
every
moment
.
"
  
<EOS>
This
was
very
proper
;
the
sigh
which
accompanied
it
was
really
estimable
;
but
it
should
have
lasted
longer
.
<EOS>
Emma
was
rather
in
dismay
when
only
half
a
minute
afterwards
he
began
to
speak
of
other
things
,
and
in
a
voice
of
the
greatest
alacrity
and
enjoyment
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
an
excellent
device
,
"
said
he
,
"
the
use
of
a
sheepskin
for
carriages
.
<EOS>
How
very
comfortable
they
make
it
;
 
impossible
to
feel
cold
with
such
precautions
.
<EOS>
The
contrivances
of
modern
days
indeed
have
rendered
a
gentleman
's
carriage
perfectly
complete
.
<EOS>
One
is
so
fenced
and
guarded
from
the
weather
,
that
not
a
breath
of
air
can
find
its
way
unpermitted
.
<EOS>
Weather
becomes
absolutely
of
no
consequence
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
very
cold
afternoon
 
but
in
this
carriage
we
know
nothing
of
the
matter
.
 
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
snows
a
little
I
see
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
John
Knightley
,
"
and
I
think
we
shall
have
a
good
deal
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Christmas
weather
,
"
observed
Mr.
Elton
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Quite
seasonable
;
and
extremely
fortunate
we
may
think
ourselves
that
it
did
not
begin
yesterday
,
and
prevent
this
day
's
party
,
which
it
might
very
possibly
have
done
,
for
Mr.
Woodhouse
would
hardly
have
ventured
<EOS>
had
there
been
much
snow
on
the
ground
;
but
now
it
is
of
no
consequence
.
<EOS>
This
is
quite
the
season
indeed
for
friendly
meetings
.
<EOS>
At
Christmas
every
body
invites
their
friends
about
them
,
and
people
think
little
of
even
the
worst
weather
.
<EOS>
I
was
snowed
up
at
a
friend
's
house
once
for
a
week
.
<EOS>
Nothing
could
be
pleasanter
.
<EOS>
I
went
for
only
one
night
,
and
could
not
get
away
till
that
very
day
se'nnight
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
John
Knightley
looked
as
if
he
did
not
comprehend
the
pleasure
,
but
said
only
,
coolly
,
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
wish
to
be
snowed
up
a
week
at
Randalls
.
"
  
<EOS>
At
another
time
Emma
might
have
been
amused
,
but
she
was
too
much
astonished
now
at
Mr.
Elton
's
spirits
for
other
feelings
.
<EOS>
Harriet
seemed
quite
forgotten
in
the
expectation
of
a
pleasant
party
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
are
sure
of
excellent
fires
,
"
continued
he
,
"
and
every
thing
in
the
greatest
comfort
.
<EOS>
Charming
people
,
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Weston
;
 
Mrs.
Weston
indeed
is
much
beyond
praise
,
and
he
is
exactly
what
one
values
,
so
hospitable
,
and
so
fond
of
society
;
 
it
will
be
a
small
party
,
but
where
small
parties
are
select
,
they
are
perhaps
the
most
agreeable
of
any
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Weston
's
dining
-
room
does
not
accommodate
more
than
ten
comfortably
;
and
for
my
part
,
I
would
rather
,
under
such
circumstances
,
fall
short
by
two
than
exceed
by
two
.
<EOS>
I
think
you
will
agree
with
me
,
(
turning
with
a
soft
air
to
Emma
,
)
<EOS>
I
think
I
shall
certainly
have
your
approbation
,
though
Mr.
Knightley
perhaps
,
from
being
used
to
the
large
parties
of
London
,
may
not
quite
enter
into
our
feelings
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
nothing
of
the
large
parties
of
London
,
sir
 
I
never
dine
with
any
body
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Indeed
!
<EOS>
(
in
a
tone
of
wonder
and
pity
,
)
I
had
no
idea
that
the
law
had
been
so
great
a
slavery
.
<EOS>
Well
,
sir
,
the
time
must
come
when
you
will
be
paid
for
all
this
,
when
you
will
have
little
labour
and
great
enjoyment
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
first
enjoyment
,
"
replied
John
Knightley
,
as
they
passed
through
the
sweep
-
gate
,
"
will
be
to
find
myself
safe
at
Hartfield
again
.
"
    
<EOS>
Some
change
of
countenance
was
necessary
for
each
gentleman
as
they
walked
into
Mrs.
Weston
's
drawing
-
room
;
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Elton
must
compose
his
joyous
looks
,
and
Mr.
John
Knightley
disperse
his
ill
-
humour
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Elton
must
smile
less
,
and
Mr.
John
Knightley
more
,
to
fit
them
for
the
place
.
 
<EOS>
Emma
only
might
be
as
nature
prompted
,
and
shew
herself
just
as
happy
as
she
was
.
<EOS>
To
her
it
was
real
enjoyment
to
be
with
the
Westons
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Weston
was
a
great
favourite
,
and
there
was
not
a
creature
in
the
world
to
whom
she
spoke
with
such
unreserve
,
as
to
his
wife
;
not
any
one
,
to
whom
she
related
with
such
conviction
of
being
listened
to
and
understood
,
of
being
always
interesting
and
always
intelligible
,
the
little
affairs
,
arrangements
,
perplexities
,
and
pleasures
of
her
father
and
herself
.
<EOS>
She
could
tell
nothing
of
Hartfield
,
in
which
Mrs.
Weston
had
not
a
lively
concern
;
and
half
an
hour
's
uninterrupted
communication
of
all
those
little
matters
on
which
the
daily
happiness
of
private
life
depends
,
was
one
of
the
first
gratifications
of
each
.
  
<EOS>
This
was
a
pleasure
which
perhaps
the
whole
day
's
visit
might
not
afford
,
which
certainly
did
not
belong
to
the
present
half
-
hour
;
but
the
very
sight
of
Mrs.
Weston
,
her
smile
,
her
touch
,
her
voice
was
grateful
to
Emma
,
and
she
determined
to
think
as
little
as
possible
of
Mr.
Elton
's
oddities
,
or
of
any
thing
else
unpleasant
,
and
enjoy
all
that
was
enjoyable
to
the
utmost
.
  
<EOS>
The
misfortune
of
Harriet
's
cold
had
been
pretty
well
gone
through
before
her
arrival
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Woodhouse
had
been
safely
seated
long
enough
to
give
the
history
of
it
,
besides
all
the
history
of
his
own
and
Isabella
's
coming
,
and
of
Emma
's
being
to
follow
,
and
had
indeed
just
got
to
the
end
of
his
satisfaction
that
James
should
come
and
see
his
daughter
,
when
the
others
appeared
,
and
Mrs.
Weston
,
who
had
been
almost
wholly
engrossed
by
her
attentions
to
him
,
was
able
to
turn
away
and
welcome
her
dear
Emma
.
  
<EOS>
Emma
's
project
of
forgetting
Mr.
Elton
for
a
while
made
her
rather
sorry
to
find
,
when
they
had
all
taken
their
places
,
that
he
was
close
to
her
.
<EOS>
The
difficulty
was
great
of
driving
his
strange
insensibility
towards
Harriet
,
from
her
mind
,
while
he
not
only
sat
at
her
elbow
,
but
was
continually
obtruding
his
happy
countenance
on
her
notice
,
and
solicitously
addressing
her
upon
every
occasion
.
<EOS>
Instead
of
forgetting
him
,
his
behaviour
was
such
that
she
could
not
avoid
the
internal
suggestion
of
"
Can
it
really
be
as
my
brother
imagined
?
<EOS>
can
it
be
possible
for
this
man
to
be
beginning
to
transfer
his
affections
from
Harriet
to
me
?
 
<EOS>
Absurd
and
insufferable
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Yet
he
would
be
so
anxious
for
her
being
perfectly
warm
,
would
be
so
interested
about
her
father
,
and
so
delighted
with
Mrs.
Weston
;
and
at
last
would
begin
admiring
her
drawings
with
so
much
zeal
and
so
little
knowledge
as
seemed
terribly
like
a
would
-
be
lover
,
and
made
it
some
effort
with
her
to
preserve
her
good
manners
.
<EOS>
For
her
own
sake
she
could
not
be
rude
;
and
for
Harriet
's
,
in
the
hope
that
all
would
yet
turn
out
right
,
she
was
even
positively
civil
;
but
it
was
an
effort
;
especially
as
something
was
going
on
amongst
the
others
,
in
the
most
overpowering
period
of
Mr.
Elton
's
nonsense
,
which
she
particularly
wished
to
listen
to
.
<EOS>
She
heard
enough
to
know
that
Mr.
Weston
was
giving
some
information
about
his
son
;
she
heard
the
words
"
my
son
,
"
and
"
Frank
,
"
and
"
my
son
,
"
repeated
several
times
over
;
and
,
from
a
few
other
half
-
syllables
very
much
suspected
that
he
was
announcing
an
early
visit
from
his
son
;
but
before
she
could
quiet
Mr.
Elton
,
the
subject
was
so
completely
past
that
any
reviving
question
from
her
would
have
been
awkward
.
  
<EOS>
Now
,
it
so
happened
that
in
spite
of
Emma
's
resolution
of
never
marrying
,
there
was
something
in
the
name
,
in
the
idea
of
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
,
which
always
interested
her
.
<EOS>
She
had
frequently
thought
 
especially
since
his
father
's
marriage
with
Miss
Taylor
 
<EOS>
that
if
she
_
were
_
to
marry
,
he
was
the
very
person
to
suit
her
in
age
,
character
and
condition
.
<EOS>
He
seemed
by
this
connexion
between
the
families
,
quite
to
belong
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
but
suppose
it
to
be
a
match
that
every
body
who
knew
them
must
think
of
.
<EOS>
That
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Weston
did
think
of
it
,
she
was
very
strongly
persuaded
;
and
though
not
meaning
to
be
induced
by
him
,
or
by
any
body
else
,
to
give
up
a
situation
which
she
believed
more
replete
with
good
than
any
she
could
change
it
for
,
she
had
a
great
curiosity
to
see
him
,
a
decided
intention
of
finding
him
pleasant
,
of
being
liked
by
him
to
a
certain
degree
,
and
a
sort
of
pleasure
in
the
idea
of
their
being
coupled
in
their
friends
'
imaginations
.
  
<EOS>
With
such
sensations
,
Mr.
Elton
's
civilities
were
dreadfully
ill
-
timed
;
but
she
had
the
comfort
of
appearing
very
polite
,
while
feeling
very
cross
 
and
of
thinking
that
the
rest
of
the
visit
could
not
possibly
pass
without
bringing
forward
the
same
information
again
,
or
the
substance
of
it
,
from
the
open
-
hearted
Mr.
Weston
.
 
<EOS>
So
it
proved
;
 
<EOS>
for
when
happily
released
from
Mr.
Elton
,
and
seated
by
Mr.
Weston
,
at
dinner
,
he
made
use
of
the
very
first
interval
in
the
cares
of
hospitality
,
the
very
first
leisure
from
the
saddle
of
mutton
,
to
say
to
her
,
  
<EOS>
"
We
want
only
two
more
to
be
just
the
right
number
.
<EOS>
I
should
like
to
see
two
more
here
,
 
your
pretty
little
friend
,
Miss
Smith
,
and
my
son
 
<EOS>
and
then
I
should
say
we
were
quite
complete
.
<EOS>
I
believe
you
did
not
hear
me
telling
the
others
in
the
drawing
-
room
that
we
are
expecting
Frank
.
<EOS>
I
had
a
letter
from
him
this
morning
,
and
he
will
be
with
us
within
a
fortnight
.
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
spoke
with
a
very
proper
degree
of
pleasure
;
and
fully
assented
to
his
proposition
of
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
and
Miss
Smith
making
their
party
quite
complete
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
has
been
wanting
to
come
to
us
,
"
continued
Mr.
Weston
,
"
ever
since
September
:
every
letter
has
been
full
of
it
;
but
he
can
not
command
his
own
time
.
<EOS>
He
has
those
to
please
who
must
be
pleased
,
and
who
(
between
ourselves
)
are
sometimes
to
be
pleased
only
by
a
good
many
sacrifices
.
<EOS>
But
now
I
have
no
doubt
of
seeing
him
here
about
the
second
week
in
January
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
a
very
great
pleasure
it
will
be
to
you
!
<EOS>
and
Mrs.
Weston
is
so
anxious
to
be
acquainted
with
him
,
that
she
must
be
almost
as
happy
as
yourself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
she
would
be
,
but
that
she
thinks
there
will
be
another
put
-
off
.
<EOS>
She
does
not
depend
upon
his
coming
so
much
as
I
do
:
but
she
does
not
know
the
parties
so
well
as
I
do
.
<EOS>
The
case
,
you
see
,
is
 
(
but
this
is
quite
between
ourselves
:
I
did
not
mention
a
syllable
of
it
in
the
other
room
.
<EOS>
There
are
secrets
in
all
families
,
you
know
)
 
<EOS>
The
case
is
,
that
a
party
of
friends
are
invited
to
pay
a
visit
at
Enscombe
in
January
;
and
that
Frank
's
coming
depends
upon
their
being
put
off
.
<EOS>
If
they
are
not
put
off
,
he
can
not
stir
.
<EOS>
But
I
know
they
will
,
because
it
is
a
family
that
a
certain
lady
,
of
some
consequence
,
at
Enscombe
,
has
a
particular
dislike
to
:
and
though
it
is
thought
necessary
to
invite
them
once
in
two
or
three
years
,
they
always
are
put
off
when
it
comes
to
the
point
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
the
smallest
doubt
of
the
issue
.
<EOS>
I
am
as
confident
of
seeing
Frank
here
before
the
middle
of
January
,
as
I
am
of
being
here
myself
:
but
your
good
friend
there
(
nodding
towards
the
upper
end
of
the
table
)
has
so
few
vagaries
herself
,
and
has
been
so
little
used
to
them
at
Hartfield
,
that
she
can
not
calculate
on
their
effects
,
as
I
have
been
long
in
the
practice
of
doing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
there
should
be
any
thing
like
doubt
in
the
case
,
"
replied
Emma
;
"
but
am
disposed
to
side
with
you
,
Mr.
Weston
.
<EOS>
If
you
think
he
will
come
,
I
shall
think
so
too
;
for
you
know
Enscombe
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
 
I
have
some
right
to
that
knowledge
;
though
I
have
never
been
at
the
place
in
my
life
.
 
<EOS>
She
is
an
odd
woman
!
 
<EOS>
But
I
never
allow
myself
to
speak
ill
of
her
,
on
Frank
's
account
;
for
I
do
believe
her
to
be
very
fond
of
him
.
<EOS>
I
used
to
think
she
was
not
capable
of
being
fond
of
any
body
,
except
herself
:
but
she
has
always
been
kind
to
him
(
in
her
way
 
allowing
for
little
whims
and
caprices
,
and
expecting
every
thing
to
be
as
she
likes
)
.
<EOS>
And
it
is
no
small
credit
,
<EOS>
in
my
opinion
,
to
him
,
that
he
should
excite
such
an
affection
;
for
,
though
I
would
not
say
it
to
any
body
else
,
she
has
no
more
heart
than
a
stone
to
people
in
general
;
and
the
devil
of
a
temper
.
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
liked
the
subject
so
well
,
that
she
began
upon
it
,
to
Mrs.
Weston
,
very
soon
after
their
moving
into
the
drawing
-
room
:
wishing
her
joy
 
yet
observing
,
that
she
knew
the
first
meeting
must
be
rather
alarming
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Weston
agreed
to
it
;
but
added
,
that
she
should
be
very
glad
to
be
secure
of
undergoing
the
anxiety
of
a
first
meeting
at
the
time
talked
of
:
"
for
I
can
not
depend
upon
his
coming
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
be
so
sanguine
as
Mr.
Weston
.
<EOS>
I
am
very
much
afraid
that
it
will
all
end
in
nothing
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Weston
,
I
dare
say
,
has
been
telling
you
exactly
how
the
matter
stands
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
 
it
seems
to
depend
upon
nothing
but
the
ill
-
humour
of
Mrs.
Churchill
,
which
I
imagine
to
be
the
most
certain
thing
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
Emma
!
"
replied
Mrs.
Weston
,
smiling
,
"
what
is
the
certainty
of
caprice
?
"
<EOS>
Then
turning
to
Isabella
,
who
had
not
been
attending
before
 
<EOS>
"
You
must
know
,
my
dear
Mrs.
Knightley
,
that
we
are
by
no
means
<EOS>
so
sure
of
seeing
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
,
in
my
opinion
,
as
his
father
thinks
.
<EOS>
It
depends
entirely
upon
his
aunt
's
spirits
and
pleasure
;
in
short
,
upon
her
temper
.
<EOS>
To
you
 
to
my
two
daughters
 
I
may
venture
on
the
truth
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Churchill
rules
at
Enscombe
,
and
is
a
very
odd
-
tempered
woman
;
and
his
coming
now
,
depends
upon
her
being
willing
to
spare
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Mrs.
Churchill
;
every
body
knows
Mrs.
Churchill
,
"
replied
Isabella
:
"
and
I
am
sure
I
never
think
of
that
poor
young
man
without
the
greatest
compassion
.
<EOS>
To
be
constantly
living
with
an
ill
-
tempered
person
,
must
be
dreadful
.
<EOS>
It
is
what
we
happily
have
never
known
any
thing
of
;
but
it
must
be
a
life
of
misery
.
<EOS>
What
a
blessing
,
that
she
never
had
any
children
!
<EOS>
Poor
little
creatures
,
how
unhappy
she
would
have
made
them
!
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
wished
she
had
been
alone
with
Mrs.
Weston
.
<EOS>
She
should
then
have
heard
more
:
Mrs.
Weston
would
speak
to
her
,
with
a
degree
of
unreserve
which
she
would
not
hazard
with
Isabella
;
and
,
she
really
believed
,
would
scarcely
try
to
conceal
any
thing
relative
to
the
Churchills
from
her
,
excepting
those
views
on
the
young
man
,
of
which
her
own
imagination
had
already
given
her
such
instinctive
knowledge
.
<EOS>
But
at
present
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
said
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Woodhouse
very
soon
followed
them
into
the
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
To
be
sitting
long
after
dinner
,
was
a
confinement
that
he
could
not
endure
.
<EOS>
Neither
wine
nor
conversation
was
any
thing
to
him
;
and
gladly
did
he
move
to
those
with
whom
he
was
always
comfortable
.
  
<EOS>
While
he
talked
to
Isabella
,
however
,
Emma
found
an
opportunity
of
saying
,
  
"
<EOS>
And
so
you
do
not
consider
this
visit
from
your
son
as
by
any
means
certain
.
<EOS>
I
am
sorry
for
it
.
<EOS>
The
introduction
must
be
unpleasant
,
whenever
it
takes
place
;
and
the
sooner
it
could
be
over
,
the
better
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
;
and
every
delay
makes
one
more
apprehensive
of
other
delays
.
<EOS>
Even
if
this
family
,
the
Braithwaites
,
are
put
off
,
I
am
still
afraid
that
some
excuse
may
be
found
for
disappointing
us
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
bear
to
imagine
any
reluctance
on
his
side
;
but
I
am
sure
there
is
a
great
wish
on
the
Churchills
'
to
keep
him
to
themselves
.
<EOS>
There
is
jealousy
.
<EOS>
They
are
jealous
even
of
his
regard
for
his
father
.
<EOS>
In
short
,
I
can
feel
no
dependence
on
his
coming
,
and
I
wish
Mr.
Weston
were
less
sanguine
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
ought
to
come
,
"
said
Emma
.
<EOS>
"
If
he
could
stay
only
a
couple
of
days
,
he
ought
to
come
;
and
one
can
hardly
conceive
a
young
man
's
not
having
it
in
his
power
to
do
as
much
as
that
.
<EOS>
A
young
_
woman
_
,
if
she
fall
into
bad
hands
,
may
be
teased
,
and
kept
at
a
distance
from
those
she
wants
to
be
with
;
but
one
can
not
comprehend
a
young
_
man
<EOS>
_
's
being
under
such
restraint
,
as
not
to
be
able
to
spend
a
week
with
his
father
,
if
he
likes
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
One
ought
to
be
at
Enscombe
,
and
know
the
ways
of
the
family
,
before
one
decides
upon
what
he
can
do
,
"
replied
Mrs.
Weston
.
<EOS>
"
One
ought
to
use
the
same
caution
,
perhaps
,
in
judging
of
the
conduct
of
any
one
individual
of
any
one
family
;
but
Enscombe
,
I
believe
,
certainly
must
not
be
judged
by
general
rules
:
_
she
_
is
so
very
unreasonable
;
and
every
thing
gives
way
to
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
she
is
so
fond
of
the
nephew
:
he
is
so
very
great
a
favourite
.
<EOS>
Now
,
according
to
my
idea
of
Mrs.
Churchill
,
it
would
be
most
natural
,
that
while
she
makes
no
sacrifice
for
the
comfort
of
the
husband
,
to
whom
she
owes
every
thing
,
while
she
exercises
incessant
caprice
towards
_
him
_
,
she
should
frequently
be
governed
by
the
nephew
,
to
whom
she
owes
nothing
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dearest
Emma
,
do
not
pretend
,
with
your
sweet
temper
,
to
understand
a
bad
one
,
or
to
lay
down
rules
for
it
:
you
must
let
it
go
its
own
way
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
doubt
of
his
having
,
at
times
,
considerable
influence
;
but
it
may
be
perfectly
impossible
for
him
to
know
beforehand
_
when
_
it
will
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
listened
,
and
then
coolly
said
,
"
I
shall
not
be
satisfied
,
unless
he
comes
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
may
have
a
great
deal
of
influence
on
some
points
,
"
continued
Mrs.
Weston
,
"
and
on
others
,
very
little
:
and
among
those
,
on
which
she
is
beyond
his
reach
,
it
is
but
too
likely
,
may
be
this
very
circumstance
of
his
coming
away
from
them
to
visit
us
.
"
    
<EOS>
Mr.
Woodhouse
was
soon
ready
for
his
tea
;
and
when
he
had
drank
his
tea
he
was
quite
ready
to
go
home
;
and
it
was
as
much
as
his
three
companions
could
do
,
to
entertain
away
his
notice
of
the
lateness
of
the
hour
,
before
the
other
gentlemen
appeared
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Weston
was
chatty
and
convivial
,
and
no
friend
to
early
separations
of
any
sort
;
but
at
last
the
drawing
-
room
party
did
receive
an
augmentation
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Elton
,
in
very
good
spirits
,
was
one
of
the
first
to
walk
in
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Weston
and
Emma
were
sitting
together
on
a
sofa
.
<EOS>
He
joined
them
immediately
,
and
,
with
scarcely
an
invitation
,
seated
himself
between
them
.
  
<EOS>
Emma
,
in
good
spirits
too
,
from
the
amusement
afforded
her
mind
by
the
expectation
of
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
,
was
willing
to
forget
his
late
improprieties
,
and
be
as
well
satisfied
with
him
as
before
,
and
on
his
making
Harriet
his
very
first
subject
,
was
ready
to
listen
with
most
friendly
smiles
.
  
<EOS>
He
professed
himself
extremely
anxious
about
her
fair
friend
 
her
fair
,
lovely
,
amiable
friend
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Did
she
know
?
 
<EOS>
had
she
heard
any
thing
about
her
,
since
their
being
at
Randalls
?
 
<EOS>
he
felt
much
anxiety
 
<EOS>
he
must
confess
that
the
nature
of
her
complaint
alarmed
him
considerably
.
"
<EOS>
And
in
this
style
he
talked
on
for
some
time
very
properly
,
not
much
attending
to
any
answer
,
but
altogether
sufficiently
awake
to
the
terror
of
a
bad
sore
throat
;
and
Emma
was
quite
in
charity
with
him
.
  
<EOS>
But
at
last
there
seemed
a
perverse
turn
;
it
seemed
all
at
once
as
if
he
were
more
afraid
of
its
being
a
bad
sore
throat
on
her
account
,
than
on
Harriet
's
 
more
anxious
that
she
should
escape
the
infection
,
than
that
there
should
be
no
infection
in
the
complaint
.
<EOS>
He
began
with
great
earnestness
to
entreat
her
to
refrain
from
visiting
the
sick
-
chamber
again
,
for
the
present
 
to
entreat
her
to
_
promise
_
_
<EOS>
him
_
<EOS>
not
to
venture
into
such
hazard
till
he
had
seen
Mr.
Perry
and
learnt
his
opinion
;
and
though
she
tried
to
laugh
it
off
and
bring
the
subject
back
into
its
proper
course
,
there
was
no
putting
an
end
to
his
extreme
solicitude
about
her
.
<EOS>
She
was
vexed
.
<EOS>
It
did
appear
 
there
was
no
concealing
it
 
exactly
like
the
pretence
of
being
in
love
with
her
,
instead
of
Harriet
;
an
inconstancy
,
if
real
,
the
most
contemptible
and
abominable
!
<EOS>
and
she
had
difficulty
in
behaving
with
temper
.
<EOS>
He
turned
to
Mrs.
Weston
to
implore
her
assistance
,
"
Would
not
she
give
him
her
support
?
 
<EOS>
would
not
she
add
her
persuasions
to
his
,
to
induce
Miss
Woodhouse
not
to
go
to
Mrs.
Goddard
's
till
it
were
certain
that
Miss
Smith
's
disorder
had
no
infection
?
<EOS>
He
could
not
be
satisfied
without
a
promise
 
would
not
she
give
him
her
influence
in
procuring
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
So
scrupulous
for
others
,
"
he
continued
,
"
and
yet
so
careless
for
herself
!
<EOS>
She
wanted
me
to
nurse
my
cold
by
staying
at
home
to
-
day
,
and
yet
will
not
promise
to
avoid
the
danger
of
catching
an
ulcerated
sore
throat
herself
.
<EOS>
Is
this
fair
,
Mrs.
Weston
?
 
<EOS>
Judge
between
us
.
<EOS>
Have
not
I
some
right
to
complain
?
<EOS>
I
am
sure
of
your
kind
support
and
aid
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
saw
Mrs.
Weston
's
surprize
,
and
felt
that
it
must
be
great
,
at
an
address
which
,
in
words
and
manner
,
was
assuming
to
himself
the
right
of
first
interest
in
her
;
and
as
for
herself
,
she
was
too
much
provoked
and
offended
to
have
the
power
of
directly
saying
any
thing
to
the
purpose
.
<EOS>
She
could
only
give
him
a
look
;
but
it
was
such
a
look
as
she
thought
must
restore
him
to
his
senses
,
and
then
left
the
sofa
,
removing
to
a
seat
by
her
sister
,
and
giving
her
all
her
attention
.
  
<EOS>
She
had
not
time
to
know
how
Mr.
Elton
took
the
reproof
,
so
rapidly
did
another
subject
succeed
;
for
Mr.
John
Knightley
now
came
into
the
room
from
examining
the
weather
,
and
opened
on
them
all
with
the
information
of
the
ground
being
covered
with
snow
,
and
of
its
still
snowing
fast
,
with
a
strong
drifting
wind
;
concluding
with
these
words
to
Mr.
Woodhouse
:
  
"
This
will
prove
a
spirited
beginning
of
your
winter
engagements
,
sir
.
<EOS>
Something
new
for
your
coachman
and
horses
to
be
making
their
way
through
a
storm
of
snow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Poor
Mr.
Woodhouse
was
silent
from
consternation
;
but
every
body
else
had
something
to
say
;
every
body
was
either
surprized
or
not
surprized
,
and
had
some
question
to
ask
,
or
some
comfort
to
offer
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Weston
and
Emma
tried
earnestly
to
cheer
him
and
turn
his
attention
from
his
son
-
in
-
law
,
who
was
pursuing
his
triumph
rather
unfeelingly
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
admired
your
resolution
very
much
,
sir
,
"
said
he
,
"
<EOS>
in
venturing
out
in
such
weather
,
for
of
course
you
saw
there
would
be
snow
very
soon

<EOS>
Every
body
must
have
seen
the
snow
coming
on
.
<EOS>
I
admired
your
spirit
;
and
I
dare
say
we
shall
get
home
very
well
.
<EOS>
Another
hour
or
two
's
snow
can
hardly
make
the
road
impassable
;
and
we
are
two
carriages
;
if
one
is
blown
over
in
the
bleak
part
of
the
common
field
there
will
be
the
other
at
hand
.
<EOS>
I
dare
say
we
shall
be
all
safe
at
Hartfield
before
midnight
.

Mr.
Weston
,
with
triumph
of
a
different
sort
,
was
confessing
that
he
had
known
it
to
be
snowing
some
time
,
but
had
not
said
a
word
,
lest
it
should
make
Mr.
Woodhouse
uncomfortable
,
and
be
an
excuse
for
his
hurrying
away
.
<EOS>
As
to
there
being
any
quantity
of
snow
fallen
or
likely
to
fall
to
impede
their
return
,
that
was
a
mere
joke
;
he
was
afraid
they
would
find
no
difficulty
.
<EOS>
He
wished
the
road
might
be
impassable
,
that
he
might
be
able
to
keep
them
all
at
Randalls
;
and
with
the
utmost
good
-
will
was
sure
that
accommodation
might
be
found
for
every
body
,
calling
on
his
wife
to
agree
with
him
,
that
with
a
little
contrivance
,
every
body
might
be
lodged
,
which
she
hardly
knew
how
to
do
,
from
the
consciousness
of
there
being
but
two
spare
rooms
in
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
to
be
done
,
my
dear
Emma
?
 
<EOS>
what
is
to
be
done
?
"
was
Mr.
Woodhouse
's
first
exclamation
,
and
all
that
he
could
say
for
some
time
.
<EOS>
To
her
he
looked
for
comfort
;
and
her
assurances
of
safety
,
her
representation
of
the
excellence
of
the
horses
,
and
of
James
,
and
of
their
having
so
many
friends
about
them
,
revived
him
a
little
.
  
<EOS>
His
eldest
daughter
's
alarm
was
equal
to
his
own
.
<EOS>
The
horror
of
being
blocked
up
at
Randalls
,
while
her
children
were
at
Hartfield
,
was
full
in
her
imagination
;
and
fancying
the
road
to
be
now
just
passable
for
adventurous
people
,
but
in
a
state
that
admitted
no
delay
,
she
was
eager
to
have
it
settled
,
that
her
father
and
Emma
should
remain
at
Randalls
,
while
she
and
her
husband
set
forward
instantly
through
all
the
possible
accumulations
of
drifted
snow
that
might
impede
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
had
better
order
the
carriage
directly
,
my
love
,
"
said
she
;
<EOS>
"
I
dare
say
we
shall
be
able
to
get
along
,
if
we
set
off
directly
;
and
if
we
do
come
to
any
thing
very
bad
,
I
can
get
out
and
walk
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
at
all
afraid
.
<EOS>
I
should
not
mind
walking
half
the
way
.
<EOS>
I
could
change
my
shoes
,
you
know
,
the
moment
I
got
home
;
and
it
is
not
the
sort
of
thing
that
gives
me
cold
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Indeed
!
"
replied
he
.
"
<EOS>
Then
,
my
dear
Isabella
,
it
is
the
most
extraordinary
sort
of
thing
in
the
world
,
for
in
general
every
thing
does
give
you
cold
.
<EOS>
Walk
home
!
 
<EOS>
you
are
prettily
shod
for
walking
home
,
I
dare
say
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
bad
enough
for
the
horses
.
"
  
<EOS>
Isabella
turned
to
Mrs.
Weston
for
her
approbation
of
the
plan
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Weston
could
only
approve
.
<EOS>
Isabella
then
went
to
Emma
;
but
Emma
could
not
so
entirely
give
up
the
hope
of
their
being
all
able
to
get
away
;
and
they
were
still
discussing
the
point
,
when
Mr.
Knightley
,
who
had
left
the
room
immediately
after
his
brother
's
first
report
of
the
snow
,
came
back
again
,
and
told
them
that
he
had
been
out
of
doors
to
examine
,
and
could
answer
for
there
not
being
the
smallest
difficulty
in
their
getting
home
,
whenever
they
liked
it
,
either
now
or
an
hour
hence
.
<EOS>
He
had
gone
beyond
the
sweep
 
some
way
along
the
Highbury
road
 
<EOS>
the
snow
was
nowhere
above
<EOS>
half
an
inch
deep
 
in
many
places
hardly
enough
to
whiten
the
ground
;
a
very
few
flakes
were
falling
at
present
,
but
the
clouds
were
parting
,
and
there
was
every
appearance
of
its
being
soon
over
.
<EOS>
He
had
seen
the
coachmen
,
and
they
both
agreed
with
him
in
there
being
nothing
to
apprehend
.
  
<EOS>
To
Isabella
,
the
relief
of
such
tidings
was
very
great
,
and
they
were
scarcely
less
acceptable
to
Emma
on
her
father
's
account
,
who
was
immediately
set
as
much
at
ease
on
the
subject
as
his
nervous
constitution
allowed
;
but
the
alarm
that
had
been
raised
could
not
be
appeased
so
as
to
admit
of
any
comfort
for
him
while
he
continued
at
Randalls
.
<EOS>
He
was
satisfied
of
there
being
no
present
danger
in
returning
home
,
but
no
assurances
could
convince
him
that
it
was
safe
to
stay
;
and
while
the
others
were
variously
urging
and
recommending
,
Mr.
Knightley
and
Emma
settled
it
in
a
few
brief
sentences
:
thus
    
"
Your
father
will
not
be
easy
;
why
do
not
you
go
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
ready
,
if
the
others
are
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
ring
the
bell
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
the
bell
was
rung
,
and
the
carriages
spoken
for
.
<EOS>
A
few
minutes
more
,
and
Emma
hoped
to
see
one
troublesome
companion
deposited
in
his
own
house
,
to
get
sober
and
cool
,
and
the
other
recover
his
temper
and
happiness
when
this
visit
of
hardship
were
over
.
  
<EOS>
The
carriage
came
:
and
Mr.
Woodhouse
,
always
the
first
object
on
such
occasions
,
was
carefully
attended
to
his
own
by
Mr.
Knightley
and
Mr.
Weston
;
but
not
all
that
either
could
say
could
prevent
some
renewal
of
alarm
at
the
sight
of
the
snow
which
had
actually
fallen
,
and
the
discovery
of
a
much
darker
night
than
he
had
been
prepared
for
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
was
afraid
they
should
have
a
very
bad
drive
.
<EOS>
He
was
afraid
poor
Isabella
would
not
like
it
.
<EOS>
And
there
would
be
poor
Emma
in
the
carriage
behind
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
know
what
they
had
best
do
.
<EOS>
They
must
keep
as
much
together
as
they
could
;
"
and
James
was
talked
to
,
and
given
a
charge
to
go
very
slow
and
wait
for
the
other
carriage
.
  
<EOS>
Isabella
stept
in
after
her
father
;
John
Knightley
,
forgetting
that
he
did
not
belong
to
their
party
,
stept
in
after
his
wife
very
naturally
;
so
that
Emma
found
,
on
being
escorted
and
followed
into
the
second
carriage
by
Mr.
Elton
,
that
the
door
was
to
be
lawfully
shut
on
them
,
and
that
they
were
to
have
a
tete
-
a
-
tete
drive
.
<EOS>
It
would
not
have
been
the
awkwardness
of
a
moment
,
it
would
have
been
rather
a
pleasure
,
previous
to
the
suspicions
of
this
very
day
;
she
could
have
talked
to
him
of
Harriet
,
and
the
three
-
quarters
of
a
mile
would
have
seemed
but
one
.
<EOS>
But
now
,
she
would
rather
it
had
not
happened
.
<EOS>
She
believed
he
had
been
drinking
too
much
of
Mr.
Weston
's
good
wine
,
and
felt
sure
that
he
would
want
to
be
talking
nonsense
.
  
<EOS>
To
restrain
him
as
much
as
might
be
,
by
her
own
manners
,
she
was
immediately
preparing
to
speak
with
exquisite
calmness
and
gravity
of
the
weather
and
the
night
;
but
scarcely
had
she
begun
,
scarcely
had
they
passed
the
sweep
-
gate
and
joined
the
other
carriage
,
than
she
found
her
subject
cut
up
 
her
hand
seized
 
her
attention
demanded
,
and
Mr.
Elton
actually
making
violent
love
to
her
:
availing
himself
of
the
precious
opportunity
,
declaring
sentiments
which
must
be
already
well
known
,
hoping
 
fearing
 
adoring
 
ready
to
die
if
she
refused
him
;
but
flattering
himself
that
his
ardent
attachment
and
unequalled
love
and
unexampled
passion
could
not
fail
of
having
some
effect
,
and
in
short
,
very
much
resolved
on
being
seriously
accepted
as
soon
as
possible
.
<EOS>
It
really
was
so
.
<EOS>
Without
scruple
 
without
apology
 
without
much
apparent
diffidence
,
Mr.
Elton
,
the
lover
of
Harriet
,
was
professing
himself
_
<EOS>
her
_
lover
.
<EOS>
She
tried
to
stop
him
;
but
vainly
;
he
would
go
on
,
and
say
it
all
.
<EOS>
Angry
as
she
was
,
the
thought
of
the
moment
made
her
resolve
to
restrain
herself
when
she
did
speak
.
<EOS>
She
felt
that
half
this
folly
must
be
drunkenness
,
and
therefore
could
hope
that
it
might
belong
only
to
the
passing
hour
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
with
a
mixture
of
the
serious
and
the
playful
,
which
she
hoped
would
best
suit
his
half
and
half
state
,
she
replied
,
  
"
<EOS>
I
am
very
much
astonished
,
Mr.
Elton
.
<EOS>
This
to
_
me
<EOS>
_
!
<EOS>
you
forget
yourself
 
<EOS>
you
take
me
for
my
friend
 
any
message
to
Miss
Smith
I
shall
be
happy
to
deliver
;
but
no
more
of
this
to
_
me
<EOS>
_
,
if
you
please
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Smith
!
 
<EOS>
message
to
Miss
Smith
!
 
<EOS>
What
could
she
possibly
mean
!
"
 
<EOS>
And
he
repeated
her
words
with
such
assurance
of
accent
,
such
boastful
pretence
of
amazement
,
that
she
could
not
help
replying
with
quickness
,
  
"
Mr.
Elton
<EOS>
,
this
is
the
most
extraordinary
conduct
!
<EOS>
and
I
can
account
for
it
only
in
one
way
;
you
are
not
yourself
,
or
you
could
not
speak
either
to
me
,
or
of
Harriet
,
in
such
a
manner
.
<EOS>
Command
yourself
enough
to
say
no
more
,
and
I
will
endeavour
to
forget
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
But
Mr.
Elton
had
only
drunk
wine
enough
to
elevate
his
spirits
,
not
at
all
to
confuse
his
intellects
.
<EOS>
He
perfectly
knew
his
own
meaning
;
and
having
warmly
protested
against
her
suspicion
as
most
injurious
,
and
slightly
touched
upon
his
respect
for
Miss
Smith
as
her
friend
,
 
but
acknowledging
his
wonder
that
Miss
Smith
should
be
mentioned
at
all
,
 
he
resumed
the
subject
of
his
own
passion
,
and
was
very
urgent
for
a
favourable
answer
.
  
<EOS>
As
she
thought
less
of
his
inebriety
,
she
thought
more
of
his
inconstancy
and
presumption
;
and
with
fewer
struggles
for
politeness
,
replied
,
  
"
<EOS>
It
is
impossible
for
me
to
doubt
any
longer
.
<EOS>
You
have
made
yourself
too
clear
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Elton
,
my
astonishment
is
much
beyond
any
thing
I
can
express
.
<EOS>
After
such
behaviour
,
as
I
have
witnessed
during
the
last
month
,
to
Miss
Smith
 
<EOS>
such
attentions
as
I
have
been
in
the
daily
habit
of
observing
 
to
be
addressing
me
in
this
manner
 
<EOS>
this
is
an
unsteadiness
of
character
,
indeed
,
which
I
had
not
supposed
possible
!
<EOS>
Believe
me
,
sir
,
I
am
far
,
very
far
,
from
gratified
in
being
the
object
of
such
professions
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Good
Heaven
!
"
cried
Mr.
Elton
,
"
what
can
be
the
meaning
of
this
?
 
<EOS>
Miss
Smith
!
 
<EOS>
I
never
thought
of
Miss
Smith
in
the
whole
course
of
my
existence
 
never
paid
her
any
attentions
,
but
as
your
friend
:
never
cared
whether
she
were
dead
or
alive
,
but
as
your
friend
.
<EOS>
If
she
has
fancied
otherwise
,
her
own
wishes
have
misled
her
,
and
I
am
very
sorry
 
<EOS>
extremely
sorry
 
<EOS>
But
,
Miss
Smith
,
indeed
!
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
Miss
Woodhouse
!
<EOS>
who
can
think
of
Miss
Smith
,
when
Miss
Woodhouse
is
near
!
<EOS>
No
,
upon
my
honour
,
there
is
no
unsteadiness
of
character
.
<EOS>
I
have
thought
only
of
you
.
<EOS>
I
protest
against
having
paid
the
smallest
attention
to
any
one
else
.
<EOS>
Every
thing
that
I
have
said
or
done
,
for
many
weeks
past
,
has
been
with
the
sole
view
of
marking
my
adoration
of
yourself
.
<EOS>
You
can
not
really
,
seriously
,
doubt
it
.
<EOS>
No
!
 
<EOS>
(
in
an
accent
meant
to
be
insinuating
)
 
<EOS>
I
am
sure
you
have
seen
and
understood
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
would
be
impossible
to
say
what
Emma
felt
,
on
hearing
this
 
which
of
all
her
unpleasant
sensations
was
uppermost
.
<EOS>
She
was
too
completely
overpowered
to
be
immediately
able
to
reply
:
and
two
moments
of
silence
being
ample
encouragement
for
Mr.
Elton
's
sanguine
state
of
mind
,
he
tried
to
take
her
hand
again
,
as
he
joyously
exclaimed
    
"
Charming
Miss
Woodhouse
!
<EOS>
allow
me
to
interpret
this
interesting
silence
.
<EOS>
It
confesses
that
you
have
long
understood
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
,
"
cried
Emma
,
"
it
confesses
no
such
thing
.
<EOS>
So
far
from
having
long
understood
you
,
I
have
been
in
a
most
complete
error
with
respect
to
your
views
,
till
this
moment
.
<EOS>
As
to
myself
,
I
am
very
sorry
that
you
should
have
been
giving
way
to
any
feelings
 
<EOS>
Nothing
could
be
farther
from
my
wishes
 
your
attachment
to
my
friend
Harriet
 
your
pursuit
of
her
,
(
pursuit
,
it
appeared
,
)
<EOS>
gave
me
great
pleasure
,
and
I
have
been
very
earnestly
wishing
you
success
:
but
had
I
supposed
that
she
were
not
your
attraction
to
Hartfield
<EOS>
,
I
should
certainly
have
thought
you
judged
ill
in
making
your
visits
so
frequent
.
<EOS>
Am
I
to
believe
that
you
have
never
sought
to
recommend
yourself
particularly
to
Miss
Smith
?
 
<EOS>
that
you
have
never
thought
seriously
of
her
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Never
,
madam
,
"
cried
he
,
affronted
in
his
turn
:
<EOS>
"
never
,
I
assure
you
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
I
<EOS>
_
think
seriously
of
Miss
Smith
!
 
<EOS>
Miss
Smith
is
a
very
good
sort
of
girl
;
and
I
should
be
happy
to
see
her
respectably
settled
.
<EOS>
I
wish
her
extremely
well
:
and
,
no
doubt
,
there
are
men
who
might
not
object
to
 
<EOS>
Every
body
has
their
level
:
but
as
for
myself
,
I
am
not
,
I
think
,
quite
so
much
at
a
loss
.
<EOS>
I
need
not
so
totally
despair
of
an
equal
alliance
,
as
to
be
addressing
myself
to
Miss
Smith
!
 
<EOS>
No
,
madam
,
my
visits
to
Hartfield
have
been
for
yourself
only
;
and
the
encouragement
I
received
 
"
  
"
Encouragement
!
 
<EOS>
I
give
you
encouragement
!
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
you
have
been
entirely
mistaken
in
supposing
it
.
<EOS>
I
have
seen
you
only
as
the
admirer
of
my
friend
.
<EOS>
In
no
other
light
could
you
have
been
more
to
me
than
a
common
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
I
am
exceedingly
sorry
:
but
it
is
well
that
the
mistake
ends
where
it
does
.
<EOS>
Had
the
same
behaviour
continued
,
Miss
Smith
might
have
been
led
into
a
misconception
of
your
views
;
not
being
aware
,
probably
,
any
more
than
myself
,
of
the
very
great
inequality
which
you
are
so
sensible
of
.
<EOS>
But
,
as
it
is
,
the
disappointment
is
single
,
and
,
I
trust
,
will
not
be
lasting
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
thoughts
of
matrimony
at
present
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
was
too
angry
to
say
another
word
;
her
manner
too
decided
to
invite
supplication
;
and
in
this
state
of
swelling
resentment
,
and
mutually
deep
mortification
,
they
had
to
continue
together
a
few
minutes
longer
,
for
the
fears
of
Mr.
Woodhouse
<EOS>
had
confined
them
to
a
foot
-
pace
.
<EOS>
If
there
had
not
been
so
much
anger
,
there
would
have
been
desperate
awkwardness
;
but
their
straightforward
emotions
left
no
room
for
the
little
zigzags
of
embarrassment
.
<EOS>
Without
knowing
when
the
carriage
turned
into
Vicarage
Lane
,
or
when
it
stopped
,
they
found
themselves
,
all
at
once
,
at
the
door
of
his
house
;
and
he
was
out
before
another
syllable
passed
.
 
<EOS>
Emma
then
felt
it
indispensable
to
wish
him
a
good
night
.
<EOS>
The
compliment
was
just
returned
,
coldly
and
proudly
;
and
,
under
indescribable
irritation
of
spirits
,
she
was
then
conveyed
to
Hartfield
.
  
<EOS>
There
she
was
welcomed
,
with
the
utmost
delight
,
by
her
father
,
who
had
been
trembling
for
the
dangers
of
a
solitary
drive
from
Vicarage
Lane
 
turning
a
corner
which
he
could
never
bear
to
think
of
 
and
in
strange
hands
 
a
mere
common
coachman
 
<EOS>
no
James
<EOS>
;
and
there
it
seemed
as
if
her
return
only
were
wanted
to
make
every
thing
go
well
:
for
Mr.
John
Knightley
,
ashamed
of
his
ill
-
humour
,
was
now
all
kindness
and
attention
;
and
so
particularly
solicitous
for
the
comfort
of
her
father
,
as
to
seem
 
if
not
quite
ready
to
join
him
in
a
basin
of
gruel
 
perfectly
sensible
of
its
being
exceedingly
wholesome
;
and
the
day
was
concluding
in
peace
and
comfort
to
all
their
little
party
,
except
herself
.
 
<EOS>
But
her
mind
had
never
been
in
such
perturbation
;
and
it
needed
a
very
strong
effort
to
appear
attentive
and
cheerful
till
the
usual
hour
of
separating
allowed
her
the
relief
of
quiet
reflection
.
    
<EOS>
The
hair
was
curled
,
and
the
maid
sent
away
,
and
Emma
sat
down
to
think
and
be
miserable
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
wretched
business
indeed
!
 
<EOS>
Such
an
overthrow
of
every
thing
she
had
been
wishing
for
!
 
<EOS>
Such
a
development
of
every
thing
most
unwelcome
!
 
<EOS>
Such
a
blow
for
Harriet
!
 
<EOS>
that
was
the
worst
of
all
.
<EOS>
Every
part
of
it
brought
pain
and
humiliation
,
of
some
sort
or
other
;
but
,
compared
with
the
evil
to
Harriet
,
all
was
light
;
and
she
would
gladly
have
submitted
to
feel
yet
more
mistaken
 
more
in
error
 
more
disgraced
by
mis
-
judgment
,
than
she
actually
was
,
could
the
effects
of
her
blunders
have
been
confined
to
herself
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
had
not
persuaded
Harriet
into
liking
the
man
,
I
could
have
borne
any
thing
.
<EOS>
He
might
have
doubled
his
presumption
to
me
 
but
poor
Harriet
!
"
  
<EOS>
How
she
could
have
been
so
deceived
!
 
<EOS>
He
protested
that
he
had
never
thought
seriously
of
Harriet
 
never
!
<EOS>
She
looked
back
as
well
as
she
could
;
but
it
was
all
confusion
.
<EOS>
She
had
taken
up
the
idea
,
she
supposed
,
and
made
every
thing
bend
to
it
.
<EOS>
His
manners
,
however
,
must
have
been
unmarked
,
wavering
,
dubious
,
or
<EOS>
she
could
not
have
been
so
misled
.
  
<EOS>
The
picture
!
 
<EOS>
How
eager
he
had
been
about
the
picture
!
 
and
the
charade
!
 
<EOS>
and
an
hundred
other
circumstances
;
 
<EOS>
how
clearly
they
had
seemed
to
point
at
Harriet
.
<EOS>
To
be
sure
,
the
charade
,
with
its
"
ready
wit
"
 
but
then
the
"
soft
eyes
"
 
<EOS>
in
fact
it
suited
neither
;
it
was
a
jumble
without
taste
or
truth
.
<EOS>
Who
could
have
seen
through
such
thick
-
headed
nonsense
?
  
<EOS>
Certainly
she
had
often
,
especially
of
late
,
thought
his
manners
to
herself
unnecessarily
gallant
;
but
it
had
passed
as
his
way
,
as
a
mere
error
of
judgment
,
of
knowledge
,
of
taste
,
as
one
proof
among
others
that
he
had
not
always
lived
in
the
best
society
,
that
with
all
the
gentleness
of
his
address
,
true
elegance
was
sometimes
wanting
;
but
,
till
this
very
day
,
she
had
never
,
for
an
instant
,
suspected
it
to
mean
any
thing
but
grateful
respect
to
her
as
Harriet
's
friend
.
  
<EOS>
To
Mr.
John
Knightley
was
she
indebted
for
her
first
idea
on
the
subject
,
for
the
first
start
of
its
possibility
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
denying
that
those
brothers
had
penetration
.
<EOS>
She
remembered
what
Mr.
Knightley
had
once
said
to
her
about
Mr.
Elton
,
the
caution
he
had
given
,
the
conviction
he
had
professed
that
Mr.
Elton
would
never
marry
indiscreetly
;
and
blushed
to
think
how
much
truer
a
knowledge
of
his
character
had
been
there
shewn
than
any
she
had
reached
herself
.
<EOS>
It
was
dreadfully
mortifying
;
but
Mr.
Elton
was
proving
himself
,
in
many
respects
,
the
very
reverse
of
what
she
had
meant
and
believed
him
;
proud
,
assuming
,
conceited
;
very
full
of
his
own
claims
,
and
little
concerned
about
the
feelings
of
others
.
  
<EOS>
Contrary
to
the
usual
course
of
things
,
Mr.
Elton
's
wanting
to
pay
his
addresses
to
her
had
sunk
him
in
her
opinion
.
<EOS>
His
professions
and
his
proposals
did
him
no
service
.
<EOS>
She
thought
nothing
of
his
attachment
,
and
was
insulted
by
his
hopes
.
<EOS>
He
wanted
to
marry
well
,
and
having
the
arrogance
to
raise
his
eyes
to
her
,
pretended
to
be
in
love
;
but
she
was
perfectly
easy
as
to
his
not
suffering
any
disappointment
that
need
be
cared
for
.
<EOS>
There
had
been
no
real
affection
either
in
his
language
or
manners
.
<EOS>
Sighs
and
fine
words
had
been
given
in
abundance
;
but
she
could
hardly
devise
any
set
of
expressions
,
or
fancy
any
tone
of
voice
,
less
allied
with
real
love
.
<EOS>
She
need
not
trouble
herself
to
pity
him
.
<EOS>
He
only
wanted
to
aggrandise
and
enrich
himself
;
and
if
Miss
Woodhouse
of
Hartfield
,
the
heiress
of
thirty
thousand
pounds
,
were
not
quite
so
easily
obtained
as
he
had
fancied
,
he
would
soon
try
for
Miss
Somebody
else
with
twenty
,
or
with
ten
.
  
<EOS>
But
 
that
he
should
talk
of
encouragement
,
should
consider
her
as
aware
of
his
views
,
accepting
his
attentions
,
meaning
(
in
short
)
,
to
marry
him
!
 
<EOS>
should
suppose
himself
her
equal
in
connexion
or
mind
!
 
<EOS>
look
down
upon
her
friend
,
so
well
understanding
the
gradations
of
rank
below
him
,
and
be
so
blind
to
what
rose
above
,
as
to
fancy
himself
shewing
no
presumption
in
addressing
her
!
 
<EOS>
It
was
most
provoking
.
  
<EOS>
Perhaps
it
was
not
fair
to
expect
him
to
feel
how
very
much
he
was
her
inferior
in
talent
,
and
all
the
elegancies
of
mind
.
<EOS>
The
very
want
of
such
equality
might
prevent
his
perception
of
it
;
but
he
must
know
that
in
fortune
and
consequence
she
was
greatly
his
superior
.
<EOS>
He
must
know
that
the
Woodhouses
had
been
settled
for
several
generations
at
Hartfield
,
the
younger
branch
of
a
very
ancient
family
 
and
that
the
Eltons
were
nobody
.
<EOS>
The
landed
property
of
Hartfield
certainly
was
inconsiderable
,
being
but
a
sort
of
notch
in
the
Donwell
Abbey
estate
,
to
which
all
the
rest
of
Highbury
belonged
;
but
their
fortune
,
from
other
sources
,
was
such
as
to
make
them
scarcely
secondary
to
Donwell
Abbey
itself
,
in
every
other
kind
of
consequence
;
and
the
Woodhouses
had
long
held
a
high
place
in
the
consideration
of
the
neighbourhood
which
Mr.
Elton
had
first
entered
not
two
years
ago
,
to
make
his
way
as
he
could
,
without
any
alliances
but
in
trade
,
or
any
thing
to
recommend
him
to
notice
<EOS>
but
his
situation
and
his
civility
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
had
fancied
her
in
love
with
him
;
that
evidently
must
have
been
his
dependence
;
and
after
raving
a
little
about
the
seeming
incongruity
of
gentle
manners
and
a
conceited
head
,
Emma
was
obliged
in
common
honesty
to
stop
and
admit
that
her
own
behaviour
to
him
had
been
so
complaisant
and
obliging
,
so
full
of
courtesy
and
attention
,
as
(
supposing
her
real
motive
unperceived
)
might
warrant
a
man
of
ordinary
observation
and
delicacy
,
like
Mr.
Elton
,
in
fancying
himself
a
very
decided
favourite
.
<EOS>
If
_
she
_
had
so
misinterpreted
his
feelings
,
she
had
little
right
to
wonder
that
_
<EOS>
he
_
,
with
self
-
interest
to
blind
him
,
should
have
mistaken
hers
.
  
<EOS>
The
first
error
and
the
worst
lay
at
her
door
.
<EOS>
It
was
foolish
,
it
was
wrong
,
to
take
so
active
a
part
in
bringing
any
two
people
together
.
<EOS>
It
was
adventuring
too
far
,
assuming
too
much
,
making
light
of
what
ought
to
be
serious
,
a
trick
of
what
ought
to
be
simple
.
<EOS>
She
was
quite
concerned
and
ashamed
,
and
resolved
to
do
such
things
no
more
.
  
<EOS>
"
Here
have
I
,
"
said
she
,
"
actually
talked
poor
Harriet
into
being
very
much
attached
to
this
man
.
<EOS>
She
might
never
have
thought
of
him
but
for
me
;
and
certainly
never
would
have
thought
of
him
with
hope
,
if
I
had
not
assured
her
of
his
attachment
,
for
she
is
as
modest
and
humble
as
I
used
to
think
him
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
that
I
had
been
satisfied
with
persuading
her
not
to
accept
young
Martin
.
<EOS>
There
I
was
quite
right
.
<EOS>
That
was
well
done
of
me
;
but
there
I
should
have
stopped
,
and
left
the
rest
to
time
and
chance
.
<EOS>
I
was
introducing
her
into
good
company
,
and
giving
her
the
opportunity
of
pleasing
some
one
worth
having
;
I
ought
not
to
have
attempted
more
.
<EOS>
But
now
,
poor
girl
,
her
peace
is
cut
up
for
some
time
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
but
half
a
friend
to
her
;
and
if
she
were
_
not
_
to
feel
this
disappointment
so
very
much
,
I
am
sure
I
have
not
an
idea
of
any
body
else
who
would
be
at
all
desirable
for
her
;
 
William
Coxe
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
no
,
I
could
not
endure
William
Coxe
 
<EOS>
a
pert
young
lawyer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
stopt
to
blush
and
laugh
at
her
own
relapse
,
and
then
resumed
a
more
serious
,
more
dispiriting
cogitation
upon
what
had
been
,
and
might
be
,
and
must
be
.
<EOS>
The
distressing
explanation
she
had
to
make
to
Harriet
,
and
all
that
poor
Harriet
would
be
suffering
,
with
the
awkwardness
of
future
meetings
,
the
difficulties
of
continuing
or
discontinuing
the
acquaintance
,
of
subduing
feelings
,
concealing
resentment
,
and
avoiding
eclat
,
were
enough
to
occupy
her
in
most
unmirthful
reflections
some
time
longer
,
and
she
went
to
bed
at
last
with
nothing
settled
but
the
conviction
of
her
having
blundered
most
dreadfully
.
  
<EOS>
To
youth
and
natural
cheerfulness
like
Emma
's
,
though
under
temporary
gloom
at
night
,
the
return
of
day
will
hardly
fail
to
bring
return
of
spirits
.
<EOS>
The
youth
and
cheerfulness
of
morning
are
in
happy
analogy
,
and
of
powerful
operation
;
and
if
the
distress
be
not
poignant
enough
to
keep
the
eyes
unclosed
,
they
will
be
sure
to
open
to
sensations
of
softened
pain
and
brighter
hope
.
  
<EOS>
Emma
got
up
on
the
morrow
more
disposed
for
comfort
than
she
had
gone
to
bed
,
more
ready
to
see
alleviations
of
the
evil
before
her
,
and
to
depend
on
getting
tolerably
out
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
great
consolation
that
Mr.
Elton
should
not
be
really
in
love
with
her
,
or
so
particularly
amiable
as
to
make
it
shocking
to
disappoint
him
 
that
Harriet
's
nature
should
not
be
of
that
superior
sort
in
which
the
feelings
are
most
acute
and
retentive
 
and
that
there
could
be
no
necessity
for
any
body
's
knowing
what
had
passed
except
the
three
principals
,
and
especially
for
her
father
's
being
given
a
moment
's
uneasiness
about
it
.
  
<EOS>
These
were
very
cheering
thoughts
;
and
the
sight
of
a
great
deal
of
snow
on
the
ground
did
her
further
service
,
for
any
thing
was
welcome
that
might
justify
their
all
three
being
quite
asunder
at
present
.
  
<EOS>
The
weather
was
most
favourable
for
her
;
though
Christmas
Day
,
she
could
not
go
to
church
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Woodhouse
would
have
been
miserable
had
his
daughter
attempted
it
,
and
she
was
therefore
safe
from
either
exciting
or
receiving
unpleasant
and
most
unsuitable
ideas
.
<EOS>
The
ground
covered
with
snow
,
and
the
atmosphere
in
that
unsettled
state
between
frost
and
thaw
,
which
is
of
all
others
the
most
unfriendly
for
exercise
,
every
morning
beginning
in
rain
or
snow
,
and
every
evening
setting
in
to
freeze
,
she
was
for
many
days
a
most
honourable
prisoner
.
<EOS>
No
intercourse
with
Harriet
possible
but
by
note
;
no
church
for
her
on
Sunday
any
more
than
on
Christmas
Day
;
and
no
need
to
find
excuses
for
Mr.
Elton
's
absenting
himself
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
weather
which
might
fairly
confine
every
body
at
home
;
and
though
she
hoped
and
believed
him
to
be
really
taking
comfort
in
some
society
or
other
,
it
was
very
pleasant
to
have
her
father
so
well
satisfied
with
his
being
all
alone
in
his
own
house
,
too
wise
to
stir
out
;
and
to
hear
him
say
to
Mr.
Knightley
,
whom
no
weather
could
keep
entirely
from
them
,
    
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
Mr.
Knightley
,
why
do
not
you
stay
at
home
like
poor
Mr.
Elton
?
"
  
<EOS>
These
days
of
confinement
would
have
been
,
but
for
her
private
perplexities
,
remarkably
comfortable
,
as
such
seclusion
exactly
suited
her
brother
,
whose
feelings
must
always
be
of
great
importance
to
his
companions
;
and
he
had
,
besides
,
so
thoroughly
cleared
off
his
ill
-
humour
at
Randalls
,
that
his
amiableness
never
failed
him
during
the
rest
of
his
stay
at
Hartfield
.
<EOS>
He
was
always
agreeable
and
obliging
,
and
speaking
pleasantly
of
every
body
.
<EOS>
But
with
all
the
hopes
of
cheerfulness
,
and
all
the
present
comfort
of
delay
,
there
was
still
such
an
evil
hanging
over
her
in
the
hour
of
explanation
with
Harriet
,
as
made
it
impossible
for
Emma
to
be
ever
perfectly
at
ease
.
    
<EOS>
Mr.
and
Mrs.
John
Knightley
were
not
detained
long
at
Hartfield
.
<EOS>
The
weather
soon
improved
enough
for
those
to
move
who
must
move
;
and
Mr.
Woodhouse
having
,
as
usual
,
tried
to
persuade
his
daughter
to
stay
behind
with
all
her
children
,
was
obliged
to
see
the
whole
party
set
off
,
and
return
to
his
lamentations
over
the
destiny
of
poor
Isabella
;
 
which
poor
Isabella
,
passing
her
life
with
those
she
doated
on
,
full
of
their
merits
,
blind
to
their
faults
,
and
always
innocently
busy
,
might
have
been
a
model
of
right
feminine
happiness
.
  
<EOS>
The
evening
of
the
very
day
on
which
they
went
brought
a
note
from
Mr.
Elton
to
Mr.
Woodhouse
,
a
long
,
civil
,
ceremonious
note
,
to
say
,
with
Mr.
Elton
's
best
compliments
,
"
that
he
was
proposing
to
leave
Highbury
the
following
morning
in
his
way
to
Bath
;
where
,
in
compliance
with
the
pressing
entreaties
of
some
friends
,
he
had
engaged
to
spend
a
few
weeks
,
and
very
much
regretted
the
impossibility
he
was
under
,
from
various
circumstances
of
weather
and
business
,
of
taking
a
personal
leave
of
Mr.
Woodhouse
,
of
whose
friendly
civilities
he
should
ever
retain
a
grateful
sense
 
and
had
Mr.
Woodhouse
any
commands
,
<EOS>
should
be
happy
to
attend
to
them
.
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
was
most
agreeably
surprized
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Elton
's
absence
just
at
this
time
was
the
very
thing
to
be
desired
.
<EOS>
She
admired
him
for
contriving
it
,
though
not
able
to
give
him
much
credit
for
the
manner
in
which
it
was
announced
.
<EOS>
Resentment
could
not
have
been
more
plainly
spoken
than
in
a
civility
to
her
father
,
from
which
she
was
so
pointedly
excluded
.
<EOS>
She
had
not
even
a
share
in
his
opening
compliments
.
 
<EOS>
Her
name
was
not
mentioned
;
 
and
there
was
so
striking
a
change
in
all
this
,
and
such
an
ill
-
judged
solemnity
of
leave
-
taking
in
his
graceful
acknowledgments
,
as
she
thought
,
at
first
,
could
not
escape
her
father
's
suspicion
.
  
<EOS>
It
did
,
however
.
 
<EOS>
Her
father
was
quite
taken
up
with
the
surprize
of
so
sudden
a
journey
,
and
his
fears
that
Mr.
Elton
might
never
get
safely
to
the
end
of
it
,
and
saw
nothing
extraordinary
in
his
language
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
very
useful
note
,
for
it
supplied
them
with
fresh
matter
for
thought
and
conversation
during
the
rest
of
their
lonely
evening
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Woodhouse
talked
over
his
alarms
,
and
Emma
was
in
spirits
to
persuade
them
away
with
all
her
usual
promptitude
.
  
<EOS>
She
now
resolved
to
keep
Harriet
no
longer
in
the
dark
.
<EOS>
She
had
reason
to
believe
her
nearly
recovered
from
her
cold
,
and
it
was
desirable
that
she
should
have
as
much
time
as
possible
for
getting
the
better
of
her
other
complaint
before
the
gentleman
's
return
.
<EOS>
She
went
to
Mrs.
Goddard
's
accordingly
the
very
next
day
,
to
undergo
the
necessary
penance
of
communication
;
and
a
severe
one
it
was
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
to
destroy
all
the
hopes
which
she
had
been
so
industriously
feeding
 
to
appear
in
the
ungracious
character
of
the
one
preferred
 
and
acknowledge
herself
grossly
mistaken
and
mis
-
judging
in
all
her
ideas
on
one
subject
,
all
her
observations
,
all
her
convictions
,
all
her
prophecies
for
the
last
six
weeks
.
  
<EOS>
The
confession
completely
renewed
her
first
shame
 
and
the
sight
of
Harriet
's
tears
made
her
think
that
she
should
never
be
in
charity
with
herself
again
.
  
<EOS>
Harriet
bore
the
intelligence
very
well
 
blaming
nobody
 
and
in
every
thing
testifying
such
an
ingenuousness
of
disposition
and
lowly
opinion
of
herself
,
as
must
appear
with
particular
advantage
at
that
moment
to
her
friend
.
  
<EOS>
Emma
was
in
the
humour
to
value
simplicity
and
modesty
to
the
utmost
;
and
all
that
was
amiable
,
all
that
ought
to
be
attaching
,
seemed
on
Harriet
's
side
,
not
her
own
.
<EOS>
Harriet
did
not
consider
herself
as
having
any
thing
to
complain
of
.
<EOS>
The
affection
of
such
a
man
as
Mr.
Elton
would
have
been
too
great
a
distinction
.
 
<EOS>
She
never
could
have
deserved
him
 
and
nobody
but
so
partial
and
kind
a
friend
as
Miss
Woodhouse
would
have
thought
it
possible
.
  
<EOS>
Her
tears
fell
abundantly
 
but
her
grief
was
so
truly
artless
,
that
no
dignity
could
have
made
it
more
respectable
in
Emma
's
eyes
 
and
she
listened
to
her
and
tried
to
console
her
with
all
her
heart
and
understanding
 
really
for
the
time
convinced
that
Harriet
was
the
superior
creature
of
the
two
 
and
that
to
resemble
her
would
be
more
for
her
own
welfare
and
happiness
than
all
that
genius
or
intelligence
could
do
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
rather
too
late
in
the
day
to
set
about
being
simple
-
minded
and
ignorant
;
but
she
left
her
with
every
previous
resolution
confirmed
of
being
humble
and
discreet
,
and
repressing
imagination
all
the
rest
of
her
life
.
<EOS>
Her
second
duty
now
,
inferior
only
to
her
father
's
claims
,
was
to
promote
Harriet
's
comfort
,
and
endeavour
to
prove
her
own
affection
in
some
better
method
than
by
match
-
making
.
<EOS>
She
got
her
to
Hartfield
,
and
shewed
her
the
most
unvarying
kindness
,
striving
to
occupy
and
amuse
her
,
and
by
books
and
conversation
,
to
drive
Mr.
Elton
from
her
thoughts
.
  
<EOS>
Time
,
she
knew
,
must
be
allowed
for
this
being
thoroughly
done
;
and
she
could
suppose
herself
but
an
indifferent
judge
of
such
matters
in
general
,
and
very
inadequate
to
sympathise
in
an
attachment
to
Mr.
Elton
in
particular
;
but
it
seemed
to
her
reasonable
that
at
Harriet
's
age
,
and
with
the
entire
extinction
of
all
hope
,
such
a
progress
might
be
made
towards
a
state
of
composure
by
the
time
of
Mr.
Elton
's
return
,
as
to
allow
them
all
to
meet
again
in
the
common
routine
of
acquaintance
,
without
any
danger
of
betraying
sentiments
or
increasing
them
.
  
<EOS>
Harriet
did
think
him
all
perfection
,
and
maintained
the
non
-
existence
of
any
body
equal
to
him
in
person
or
goodness
 
and
did
,
in
truth
,
prove
herself
more
resolutely
in
love
than
Emma
had
foreseen
;
but
yet
it
appeared
to
her
<EOS>
so
natural
,
so
inevitable
to
strive
against
an
inclination
of
that
sort
_
unrequited
_
,
that
she
could
not
comprehend
its
continuing
very
long
in
equal
force
.
  
<EOS>
If
Mr.
Elton
,
on
his
return
,
made
his
own
indifference
as
evident
and
indubitable
as
she
could
not
doubt
he
would
anxiously
do
,
she
could
not
imagine
Harriet
's
persisting
to
place
her
happiness
in
the
sight
or
the
recollection
of
him
.
  
<EOS>
Their
being
fixed
,
so
absolutely
fixed
,
in
the
same
place
,
was
bad
for
each
,
for
all
three
.
<EOS>
Not
one
of
them
had
the
power
of
removal
,
or
of
effecting
any
material
change
of
society
.
<EOS>
They
must
encounter
each
other
,
and
make
the
best
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
Harriet
was
farther
unfortunate
in
the
tone
of
her
companions
at
Mrs.
Goddard
's
;
Mr.
Elton
being
the
adoration
of
all
the
teachers
and
great
girls
in
the
school
;
and
it
must
be
at
Hartfield
only
that
she
could
have
any
chance
of
hearing
him
spoken
of
with
cooling
moderation
or
repellent
truth
.
<EOS>
Where
the
wound
had
been
given
,
there
must
the
cure
be
found
if
anywhere
;
and
Emma
felt
that
,
till
she
saw
her
in
the
way
of
cure
,
there
could
be
no
true
peace
for
herself
.
    
<EOS>
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
did
not
come
.
<EOS>
When
the
time
proposed
drew
near
,
Mrs.
Weston
's
fears
were
justified
in
the
arrival
of
a
letter
of
excuse
.
<EOS>
For
the
present
,
he
could
not
be
spared
,
to
his
"
very
great
mortification
and
regret
;
but
still
he
looked
forward
with
the
hope
of
coming
to
Randalls
at
no
distant
period
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Weston
was
exceedingly
disappointed
 
<EOS>
much
more
disappointed
,
in
fact
,
than
her
husband
,
though
her
dependence
on
seeing
the
young
man
had
been
so
much
more
sober
:
but
a
sanguine
temper
,
though
for
ever
expecting
more
good
than
occurs
,
does
not
always
pay
for
its
hopes
by
any
proportionate
depression
.
<EOS>
It
soon
flies
over
the
present
failure
,
and
begins
to
hope
again
.
<EOS>
For
half
an
hour
Mr.
Weston
was
surprized
and
sorry
;
but
then
he
began
to
perceive
that
Frank
's
coming
two
or
three
months
later
would
be
a
much
better
plan
;
better
time
of
year
;
better
weather
;
and
that
he
would
be
able
,
without
any
doubt
,
to
stay
considerably
longer
with
them
than
if
he
had
come
sooner
.
  
<EOS>
These
feelings
rapidly
restored
his
comfort
,
while
Mrs.
Weston
,
of
a
more
apprehensive
disposition
,
foresaw
nothing
but
a
repetition
of
excuses
and
delays
;
and
after
all
her
concern
for
what
her
husband
was
to
suffer
,
suffered
a
great
deal
more
herself
.
  
<EOS>
Emma
was
not
at
this
time
in
a
state
of
spirits
to
care
really
about
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
's
not
coming
,
except
as
a
disappointment
at
Randalls
.
<EOS>
The
acquaintance
at
present
had
no
charm
for
her
.
<EOS>
She
wanted
,
rather
,
to
be
quiet
,
and
out
of
temptation
;
but
still
,
as
it
was
desirable
that
she
should
appear
,
in
general
,
like
her
usual
self
,
she
took
care
to
express
as
much
interest
in
the
circumstance
,
and
enter
as
warmly
into
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Weston
's
disappointment
,
as
might
naturally
belong
to
their
friendship
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
the
first
to
announce
it
to
Mr.
Knightley
;
and
exclaimed
quite
as
much
as
was
necessary
,
(
or
,
being
acting
a
part
,
perhaps
rather
more
,
)
at
the
conduct
of
the
Churchills
,
in
keeping
him
away
.
<EOS>
She
then
proceeded
to
say
a
good
deal
more
than
she
felt
,
of
the
advantage
of
such
an
addition
to
their
confined
society
in
Surry
;
the
pleasure
of
looking
at
somebody
new
;
the
gala
-
day
to
Highbury
entire
,
which
the
sight
of
him
would
have
made
;
and
ending
with
reflections
on
the
Churchills
again
,
found
herself
directly
involved
in
a
disagreement
with
Mr.
Knightley
;
and
,
to
her
great
amusement
,
perceived
that
she
was
taking
the
other
side
of
the
question
from
her
real
opinion
,
and
making
use
of
Mrs.
Weston
's
arguments
against
herself
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
Churchills
are
very
likely
in
fault
,
"
said
Mr.
Knightley
,
coolly
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
dare
say
he
might
come
if
he
would
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
why
you
should
say
so
.
<EOS>
He
wishes
exceedingly
to
come
;
but
his
uncle
and
aunt
will
not
spare
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
believe
that
he
has
not
the
power
of
coming
,
if
he
made
a
point
of
it
.
<EOS>
It
is
too
unlikely
,
for
me
to
believe
it
without
proof
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
odd
you
are
!
<EOS>
What
has
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
done
,
to
make
you
suppose
him
such
an
unnatural
creature
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
supposing
him
at
all
an
unnatural
creature
,
in
suspecting
that
he
may
have
learnt
to
be
above
his
connexions
,
and
to
care
very
little
for
any
thing
but
his
own
pleasure
,
from
living
with
those
who
have
always
set
him
the
example
of
it
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
great
deal
more
natural
than
one
could
wish
,
that
a
young
man
,
brought
up
by
those
who
are
proud
,
luxurious
,
and
selfish
,
should
be
proud
,
luxurious
,
and
selfish
too
.
<EOS>
If
Frank
Churchill
had
wanted
to
see
his
father
,
he
would
have
contrived
it
between
September
and
January
.
<EOS>
A
man
at
his
age
 
<EOS>
what
is
he
?
 
<EOS>
three
or
four
-
and
-
twenty
 
can
not
be
without
the
means
of
doing
as
much
as
that
.
<EOS>
It
is
impossible
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
easily
said
,
and
easily
felt
by
you
,
who
have
always
been
your
own
master
.
<EOS>
You
are
the
worst
judge
in
the
world
,
Mr.
Knightley
,
of
the
difficulties
of
dependence
.
<EOS>
You
do
not
know
what
it
is
to
have
tempers
to
manage
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
to
be
conceived
that
a
man
of
three
or
four
-
and
-
twenty
should
not
have
liberty
of
mind
or
limb
to
that
amount
.
<EOS>
He
can
not
want
money
 
<EOS>
he
can
not
want
leisure
.
<EOS>
We
know
,
on
the
contrary
,
that
he
has
so
much
of
both
,
that
he
is
glad
to
get
rid
of
them
at
the
idlest
haunts
in
the
kingdom
.
<EOS>
We
hear
of
him
for
ever
at
some
watering
-
place
or
other
.
<EOS>
A
little
while
ago
,
he
was
at
Weymouth
.
<EOS>
This
proves
that
he
can
leave
the
Churchills
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sometimes
he
can
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
those
times
are
whenever
he
thinks
it
worth
his
while
;
whenever
there
is
any
temptation
of
pleasure
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
very
unfair
to
judge
of
any
body
's
conduct
,
without
an
intimate
knowledge
of
their
situation
.
<EOS>
Nobody
,
who
has
not
been
in
the
interior
of
a
family
,
can
say
what
the
difficulties
of
any
individual
of
that
family
may
be
.
<EOS>
We
ought
to
be
acquainted
with
Enscombe
,
and
with
Mrs.
Churchill
's
temper
,
before
we
pretend
to
decide
upon
what
her
nephew
can
do
.
<EOS>
He
may
,
at
times
,
be
able
to
do
a
great
deal
more
than
he
can
at
others
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
one
thing
,
Emma
,
which
a
man
can
always
do
,
if
he
chuses
,
and
that
is
,
his
duty
;
not
by
manoeuvring
and
finessing
,
but
by
vigour
and
resolution
.
<EOS>
It
is
Frank
Churchill
's
duty
to
pay
this
attention
to
his
father
.
<EOS>
He
knows
it
to
be
so
,
by
his
promises
and
messages
;
but
if
he
wished
to
do
it
,
it
might
be
done
.
<EOS>
A
man
who
felt
rightly
would
say
at
once
,
simply
and
resolutely
,
to
Mrs.
Churchill
 
<EOS>
"
Every
sacrifice
of
mere
pleasure
you
will
always
find
me
ready
to
make
to
your
convenience
;
but
I
must
go
and
see
my
father
immediately
.
<EOS>
I
know
he
would
be
hurt
by
my
failing
in
such
a
mark
of
respect
to
him
on
the
present
occasion
.
<EOS>
I
shall
,
therefore
,
set
off
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
 
If
he
would
say
so
to
her
at
once
,
in
the
tone
of
decision
becoming
a
man
,
there
would
be
no
opposition
made
to
his
going
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Emma
,
laughing
;
"
but
perhaps
there
might
be
some
made
to
his
coming
back
again
.
<EOS>
Such
language
for
a
young
man
entirely
dependent
,
to
use
!
 
<EOS>
Nobody
but
you
,
Mr.
Knightley
,
would
imagine
it
possible
.
<EOS>
But
you
have
not
an
idea
of
what
is
requisite
in
situations
directly
opposite
to
your
own
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
to
be
making
such
a
speech
as
that
to
the
uncle
and
aunt
,
who
have
brought
him
up
,
and
are
to
provide
for
him
!
 
<EOS>
Standing
up
in
the
middle
of
the
room
,
I
suppose
,
and
speaking
as
loud
as
he
could
!
 
<EOS>
How
can
you
imagine
such
conduct
practicable
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Depend
upon
it
,
Emma
,
a
sensible
man
would
find
no
difficulty
in
it
.
<EOS>
He
would
feel
himself
in
the
right
;
and
the
declaration
 
made
,
of
course
,
as
a
man
of
sense
would
make
it
,
in
a
proper
manner
 
would
do
him
more
good
,
raise
him
higher
,
fix
his
interest
stronger
with
the
people
he
depended
on
,
than
all
that
a
line
of
shifts
and
expedients
can
ever
do
.
<EOS>
Respect
would
be
added
to
affection
.
<EOS>
They
would
feel
that
they
could
trust
him
;
that
the
nephew
who
had
done
rightly
by
his
father
,
would
do
rightly
by
them
;
for
they
know
,
as
well
as
he
does
,
as
well
as
all
the
world
must
know
,
that
he
ought
to
pay
this
visit
to
his
father
;
and
while
meanly
exerting
their
power
to
delay
it
,
are
in
their
hearts
not
thinking
the
better
of
him
for
submitting
to
their
whims
.
<EOS>
Respect
for
right
conduct
is
felt
by
every
body
.
<EOS>
If
he
would
act
in
this
sort
of
manner
,
on
principle
,
consistently
,
regularly
,
their
little
minds
would
bend
to
his
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
rather
doubt
that
.
<EOS>
You
are
very
fond
of
bending
little
minds
;
but
where
little
minds
belong
to
rich
people
in
authority
,
I
think
they
have
a
knack
of
swelling
out
,
till
they
are
quite
as
unmanageable
as
great
ones
.
<EOS>
I
can
imagine
,
that
if
you
,
as
you
are
,
Mr.
Knightley
,
were
to
be
transported
and
placed
all
at
once
in
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
's
situation
,
you
would
be
able
to
say
and
do
just
what
you
have
been
recommending
for
him
;
and
it
might
have
a
very
good
effect
.
<EOS>
The
Churchills
might
not
have
a
word
to
say
in
return
;
but
then
,
you
would
have
no
habits
of
early
obedience
and
long
observance
to
break
through
.
<EOS>
To
him
who
has
,
it
might
not
be
so
easy
to
burst
forth
at
once
into
perfect
independence
,
and
set
all
their
claims
on
his
gratitude
and
regard
at
nought
.
<EOS>
He
may
have
as
strong
a
sense
of
what
would
be
right
,
as
you
can
have
,
without
being
so
equal
,
under
particular
circumstances
,
to
act
up
to
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
it
would
not
be
so
strong
a
sense
.
<EOS>
If
it
failed
to
produce
equal
exertion
,
it
could
not
be
an
equal
conviction
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
the
difference
of
situation
and
habit
!
<EOS>
I
wish
you
would
try
to
understand
what
an
amiable
young
man
may
be
likely
to
feel
in
directly
opposing
those
,
whom
as
child
and
boy
he
has
been
looking
up
to
all
his
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Our
amiable
young
man
is
a
very
weak
young
man
,
if
this
be
the
first
occasion
of
his
carrying
through
a
resolution
to
do
right
against
the
will
of
others
.
<EOS>
It
ought
to
have
been
a
habit
with
him
by
this
time
,
of
following
his
duty
,
instead
of
consulting
expediency
.
<EOS>
I
can
allow
for
the
fears
of
the
child
,
but
not
of
the
man
.
<EOS>
As
he
became
rational
,
he
ought
to
have
roused
himself
and
shaken
off
all
that
was
unworthy
in
their
authority
.
<EOS>
He
ought
to
have
opposed
the
first
attempt
on
their
side
to
make
him
slight
his
father
.
<EOS>
Had
he
begun
as
he
ought
,
there
would
have
been
no
difficulty
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
shall
never
agree
about
him
,
"
cried
Emma
;
"
but
that
is
nothing
extraordinary
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
the
least
idea
of
his
being
a
weak
young
man
:
I
feel
sure
that
he
is
not
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Weston
would
not
be
blind
to
folly
,
though
in
his
own
son
;
but
he
is
very
likely
to
have
a
more
yielding
,
complying
,
mild
disposition
than
would
suit
your
notions
of
man
's
perfection
.
<EOS>
I
dare
say
he
has
;
and
though
it
may
cut
him
off
from
some
advantages
,
it
will
secure
him
many
others
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
;
all
the
advantages
of
sitting
still
when
he
ought
to
move
,
and
of
leading
a
life
of
mere
idle
pleasure
,
and
fancying
himself
extremely
expert
in
finding
excuses
for
it
.
<EOS>
He
can
sit
down
and
write
a
fine
flourishing
letter
,
full
of
professions
and
falsehoods
,
and
persuade
himself
that
he
has
hit
upon
the
very
best
method
in
the
world
of
preserving
peace
at
home
and
preventing
his
father
's
having
any
right
to
complain
.
<EOS>
His
letters
disgust
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Your
feelings
are
singular
.
<EOS>
They
seem
to
satisfy
every
body
else
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suspect
they
do
not
satisfy
Mrs.
Weston
.
<EOS>
They
hardly
can
satisfy
a
woman
of
her
good
sense
and
quick
feelings
:
standing
in
a
mother
's
place
,
but
without
a
mother
's
affection
to
blind
her
.
<EOS>
It
is
on
her
account
that
attention
to
Randalls
is
doubly
due
,
and
she
must
doubly
feel
the
omission
.
<EOS>
Had
she
been
a
person
of
consequence
herself
,
he
would
have
come
I
dare
say
;
and
it
would
not
have
signified
whether
he
did
or
no
.
<EOS>
Can
you
think
your
friend
behindhand
in
these
sort
of
considerations
?
<EOS>
Do
you
suppose
she
does
not
often
say
all
this
to
herself
?
<EOS>
No
,
Emma
,
your
amiable
young
man
can
be
amiable
only
in
French
,
not
in
English
.
<EOS>
He
may
be
very
"
amiable
,
"
have
very
good
manners
,
and
be
very
agreeable
;
but
he
can
have
no
English
delicacy
towards
the
feelings
of
other
people
:
nothing
really
amiable
about
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
seem
determined
to
think
ill
of
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Me
!
 
<EOS>
not
at
all
,
"
replied
Mr.
Knightley
,
rather
displeased
;
"
I
do
not
want
to
think
ill
of
him
.
<EOS>
I
should
be
as
ready
to
acknowledge
his
merits
as
any
other
man
;
but
I
hear
of
none
,
except
what
are
merely
personal
;
that
he
is
well
-
grown
and
good
-
looking
,
with
smooth
,
plausible
manners
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
if
he
have
nothing
else
to
recommend
him
,
he
will
be
a
treasure
at
Highbury
.
<EOS>
We
do
not
often
look
upon
fine
young
men
,
well
-
bred
and
agreeable
.
<EOS>
We
must
not
be
nice
and
ask
for
all
the
virtues
into
the
bargain
.
<EOS>
Can
not
you
imagine
,
Mr.
Knightley
,
what
a
_
sensation
_
<EOS>
his
coming
will
produce
?
<EOS>
There
will
be
but
one
subject
throughout
the
parishes
of
Donwell
and
Highbury
;
but
one
interest
 
one
object
of
curiosity
;
it
will
be
all
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
;
we
shall
think
and
speak
of
nobody
else
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
excuse
my
being
so
much
over
-
powered
.
<EOS>
If
I
find
him
conversable
,
I
shall
be
glad
of
his
acquaintance
;
but
if
he
is
only
a
chattering
coxcomb
,
he
will
not
occupy
much
of
my
time
or
thoughts
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
idea
of
him
is
,
that
he
can
adapt
his
conversation
to
the
taste
of
every
body
,
and
has
the
power
as
well
as
the
wish
of
being
universally
agreeable
.
<EOS>
To
you
,
he
will
talk
of
farming
;
to
me
,
of
drawing
or
music
;
and
so
on
to
every
body
,
having
that
general
information
on
all
subjects
which
will
enable
him
to
follow
the
lead
,
or
take
the
lead
,
just
as
propriety
may
require
,
and
to
speak
extremely
well
on
each
;
that
is
my
idea
of
him
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
mine
,
"
said
Mr.
Knightley
warmly
,
"
is
,
that
if
he
turn
out
any
thing
like
it
,
he
will
be
the
most
insufferable
fellow
breathing
!
<EOS>
What
!
<EOS>
at
three
-
and
-
twenty
to
be
the
king
of
his
company
 
<EOS>
the
great
man
 
the
practised
politician
,
who
is
to
read
every
body
's
character
,
and
make
every
body
's
talents
conduce
to
the
display
of
his
own
superiority
;
to
be
dispensing
his
flatteries
around
,
that
he
may
make
all
appear
like
fools
compared
with
himself
!
<EOS>
My
dear
Emma
,
your
own
good
sense
could
not
endure
such
a
puppy
when
it
came
to
the
point
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
say
no
more
about
him
,
"
cried
Emma
,
"
you
turn
every
thing
to
evil
.
<EOS>
We
are
both
prejudiced
;
you
against
,
I
for
him
;
and
we
have
no
chance
of
agreeing
till
he
is
really
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Prejudiced
!
<EOS>
I
am
not
prejudiced
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
am
very
much
,
and
without
being
at
all
ashamed
of
it
.
<EOS>
My
love
for
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Weston
gives
me
a
decided
prejudice
in
his
favour
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
a
person
I
never
think
of
from
one
month
's
end
to
another
,
"
said
Mr.
Knightley
,
with
a
degree
of
vexation
,
which
made
Emma
immediately
talk
of
something
else
,
though
she
could
not
comprehend
why
he
should
be
angry
.
  
<EOS>
To
take
a
dislike
to
a
young
man
,
only
because
he
appeared
to
be
of
a
different
disposition
from
himself
,
was
unworthy
the
real
liberality
of
mind
which
she
was
always
used
to
acknowledge
in
him
;
for
with
all
the
high
opinion
of
himself
,
which
she
had
often
laid
to
his
charge
,
she
had
never
before
for
a
moment
supposed
it
could
make
him
unjust
to
the
merit
of
another
.
      
<EOS>
Emma
and
Harriet
had
been
walking
together
one
morning
,
and
,
in
Emma
's
opinion
,
had
been
talking
enough
of
Mr.
Elton
for
that
day
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
think
that
Harriet
's
solace
or
her
own
sins
required
more
;
and
she
was
therefore
industriously
getting
rid
of
the
subject
as
they
returned
;
 
but
it
burst
out
again
when
she
thought
she
had
succeeded
,
and
after
speaking
some
time
of
what
the
poor
must
suffer
in
winter
,
and
receiving
no
other
answer
than
a
very
plaintive
 
"
Mr.
Elton
is
so
good
to
the
poor
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
found
something
else
must
be
done
.
  
<EOS>
They
were
just
approaching
the
house
where
lived
Mrs.
and
Miss
Bates
.
<EOS>
She
determined
to
call
upon
them
and
seek
safety
in
numbers
.
<EOS>
There
was
always
sufficient
reason
for
such
an
attention
;
Mrs.
and
Miss
Bates
loved
to
be
called
on
,
and
she
knew
she
was
considered
by
the
very
few
who
presumed
ever
to
see
imperfection
in
her
,
as
rather
negligent
in
that
respect
,
and
as
not
contributing
what
she
ought
to
the
stock
of
their
scanty
comforts
.
  
<EOS>
She
had
had
many
a
hint
from
Mr.
Knightley
and
some
from
her
own
heart
,
as
to
her
deficiency
 
<EOS>
but
none
were
equal
to
counteract
the
persuasion
of
its
being
very
disagreeable
,
 
a
waste
of
time
 
<EOS>
tiresome
women
 
and
all
the
horror
of
being
in
danger
of
falling
in
with
the
second
-
rate
and
third
-
rate
of
Highbury
,
who
were
calling
on
them
for
ever
,
and
therefore
she
seldom
went
near
them
.
<EOS>
But
now
she
made
the
sudden
resolution
of
not
passing
their
door
without
going
in
 
observing
,
as
she
proposed
it
to
Harriet
,
that
,
as
well
as
she
could
calculate
,
they
were
just
now
quite
safe
from
any
letter
from
Jane
Fairfax
.
  
<EOS>
The
house
belonged
to
people
in
business
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
and
Miss
Bates
occupied
the
drawing
-
room
floor
;
and
there
,
in
the
very
moderate
-
sized
apartment
,
which
was
every
thing
to
them
,
the
visitors
were
most
cordially
and
even
gratefully
welcomed
;
the
quiet
neat
old
lady
,
who
with
her
knitting
was
seated
in
the
warmest
corner
,
wanting
even
to
give
up
her
place
to
Miss
Woodhouse
,
and
her
more
active
,
talking
daughter
,
almost
ready
to
overpower
them
with
care
and
kindness
,
thanks
for
their
visit
,
solicitude
for
their
shoes
,
anxious
inquiries
after
Mr.
Woodhouse
's
health
,
cheerful
communications
about
her
mother

,
and
sweet

cake
from
the
beaufet

"
Mrs.
Cole
had
just
been
there
,
just
called
in
for
ten
minutes
,
and
had
been
so
good
as
to
sit
an
hour
with
them
,
and
_
she
_
had
taken
a
piece
of
cake
and
been
so
kind
as
to
say
she
liked
it
very
much
;
and
,
therefore
,
she
hoped
Miss
Woodhouse
and
Miss
Smith
would
do
them
the
favour
to
eat
a
piece
too
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
mention
of
the
Coles
was
sure
to
be
followed
by
that
of
Mr.
Elton
.
<EOS>
There
was
intimacy
between
them
,
and
Mr.
Cole
had
heard
from
Mr.
Elton
since
his
going
away
.
<EOS>
Emma
knew
what
was
coming
;
they
must
have
the
letter
over
again
,
and
settle
how
long
he
had
been
gone
,
and
how
much
he
was
engaged
in
company
,
and
what
a
favourite
<EOS>
he
was
wherever
he
went
,
and
how
full
the
Master
of
the
Ceremonies
'
ball
had
been
;
and
she
went
through
it
very
well
,
with
all
the
interest
and
all
the
commendation
that
could
be
requisite
,
and
always
putting
forward
to
prevent
Harriet
's
being
obliged
to
say
a
word
.
  
<EOS>
This
she
had
been
prepared
for
when
she
entered
the
house
;
but
meant
,
having
once
talked
him
handsomely
over
,
to
be
no
farther
incommoded
by
any
troublesome
topic
,
and
to
wander
at
large
amongst
all
the
Mistresses
and
Misses
of
Highbury
,
and
their
card
-
parties
.
<EOS>
She
had
not
been
prepared
to
have
Jane
Fairfax
succeed
Mr.
Elton
;
but
he
was
actually
hurried
off
by
Miss
Bates
,
she
jumped
away
from
him
at
last
abruptly
to
the
Coles
,
to
usher
in
a
letter
from
her
niece
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
yes
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Elton
,
I
understand
 
certainly
as
to
dancing
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Cole
was
telling
me
that
dancing
at
the
rooms
at
Bath
was
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Cole
was
so
kind
as
to
sit
some
time
with
us
,
talking
of
Jane
;
for
as
soon
as
she
came
in
,
she
began
inquiring
after
her
,
Jane
is
so
very
great
a
favourite
there
.
<EOS>
Whenever
she
is
with
us
,
Mrs.
Cole
does
not
know
how
to
shew
her
kindness
enough
;
and
I
must
say
that
Jane
deserves
it
as
much
as
any
body
can
.
<EOS>
And
so
she
began
inquiring
after
her
directly
,
saying
,
"
I
know
you
can
not
have
heard
from
Jane
lately
,
because
it
is
not
her
time
for
writing
;
"
<EOS>
and
when
I
immediately
said
,
"
But
indeed
we
have
,
we
had
a
letter
this
very
morning
,
"
I
do
not
know
that
I
ever
saw
any
body
more
surprized
.
"
<EOS>
Have
you
,
upon
your
honour
?
"
said
she
;
"
well
,
that
is
quite
unexpected
.
<EOS>
Do
let
me
hear
what
she
says
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
Emma
's
politeness
was
at
hand
directly
,
to
say
,
with
smiling
interest
    
<EOS>
"
Have
you
heard
from
Miss
Fairfax
so
lately
?
<EOS>
I
am
extremely
happy
.
<EOS>
I
hope
she
is
well
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
.
<EOS>
You
are
so
kind
!
<EOS>
"
replied
the
happily
deceived
aunt
,
while
eagerly
hunting
for
the
letter
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
here
it
is
.
<EOS>
I
was
sure
it
could
not
be
far
off
;
but
I
had
put
my
huswife
upon
it
,
you
see
,
without
being
aware
,
and
so
it
was
quite
hid
,
<EOS>
but
I
had
it
in
my
hand
so
very
lately
that
I
was
almost
sure
it
must
be
on
the
table
.
<EOS>
I
was
reading
it
to
Mrs.
Cole
,
and
since
she
went
away
,
I
was
reading
it
again
to
my
mother
,
<EOS>
for
it
is
such
a
pleasure
to
her
 
a
letter
from
Jane
 
that
she
can
never
hear
it
often
enough
;
so
I
knew
it
could
not
be
far
off
,
and
here
it
is
,
only
just
under
my
huswife
 
and
since
you
are
so
kind
as
to
wish
to
hear
what
she
says
;
 
but
,
first
of
all
,
I
really
must
,
in
justice
to
Jane
,
apologise
for
her
writing
so
short
a
letter
 
<EOS>
only
two
pages
you
see
 
hardly
two
 
<EOS>
and
in
general
she
fills
the
whole
paper
and
crosses
half
.
<EOS>
My
mother
often
wonders
that
I
can
make
it
out
so
well
.
<EOS>
She
often
says
,
when
the
letter
is
first
opened
,
"
Well
,
Hetty
,
now
I
think
you
will
be
put
to
it
to
make
out
all
that
checker
-
work
"
 
do
n't
you
,
ma'am
?
 
<EOS>
And
then
I
tell
her
,
I
am
sure
she
would
contrive
to
make
it
out
herself
,
if
she
had
nobody
to
do
it
for
her
 
<EOS>
every
word
of
it
 
<EOS>
I
am
sure
she
would
pore
over
it
till
she
had
made
out
every
word
.
<EOS>
And
,
indeed
,
though
my
mother
's
eyes
are
not
so
good
as
they
were
,
she
can
see
amazingly
well
still
,
thank
God
!
<EOS>
with
the
help
of
spectacles
.
<EOS>
It
is
such
a
blessing
!
<EOS>
My
mother
's
are
really
very
good
indeed
.
<EOS>
Jane
often
says
,
when
she
is
here
,
"
I
am
sure
,
grandmama
,
you
must
have
had
very
strong
eyes
to
see
as
you
do
 
and
so
much
fine
work
as
you
have
done
too
!
 
<EOS>
I
only
wish
my
eyes
may
last
me
as
well
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
All
this
spoken
extremely
fast
obliged
Miss
Bates
to
stop
for
breath
;
and
Emma
said
something
very
civil
about
the
excellence
of
Miss
Fairfax
's
handwriting
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
extremely
kind
,
"
replied
Miss
Bates
,
highly
gratified
;
"
you
who
are
such
a
judge
,
and
write
so
beautifully
yourself
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
there
is
nobody
's
praise
that
could
give
us
so
much
pleasure
as
Miss
Woodhouse
's
.
<EOS>
My
mother
does
not
hear
;
she
is
a
little
deaf
you
know
.
<EOS>
Ma'am
,
"
addressing
her
<EOS>
,
"
do
you
hear
what
Miss
Woodhouse
is
so
obliging
to
say
about
Jane
's
handwriting
?
"
  
<EOS>
And
Emma
had
the
advantage
of
hearing
her
own
silly
compliment
repeated
twice
over
before
the
good
old
lady
could
comprehend
it
.
<EOS>
She
was
pondering
,
in
the
meanwhile
,
upon
the
possibility
,
without
seeming
very
rude
,
of
making
her
escape
from
Jane
Fairfax
's
letter
,
and
had
almost
resolved
on
hurrying
away
directly
under
some
slight
excuse
,
when
Miss
Bates
turned
to
her
again
and
seized
her
attention
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
mother
's
deafness
is
very
trifling
<EOS>
you
see
 
just
nothing
at
all
.
<EOS>
By
only
raising
my
voice
,
and
saying
any
thing
two
or
three
times
over
,
she
is
sure
to
hear
;
but
then
she
is
used
to
my
voice
.
<EOS>
But
it
is
very
remarkable
that
she
should
always
hear
Jane
better
than
she
does
me
.
<EOS>
Jane
speaks
so
distinct
!
<EOS>
However
,
she
will
not
find
her
grandmama
at
all
deafer
than
she
was
two
years
ago
;
which
is
saying
a
great
deal
at
my
mother
's
time
of
life
 
and
it
really
is
full
two
years
,
you
know
,
since
she
was
here
.
<EOS>
We
never
were
so
long
without
seeing
her
before
,
and
as
I
was
telling
Mrs.
Cole
,
we
shall
hardly
know
how
to
make
enough
of
her
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Are
you
expecting
Miss
Fairfax
here
soon
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
yes
;
next
week
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Indeed
!
 
<EOS>
that
must
be
a
very
great
pleasure
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
.
<EOS>
You
are
very
kind
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
next
week
.
<EOS>
Every
body
is
so
surprized
;
and
every
body
says
the
same
obliging
things
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
she
will
be
as
happy
to
see
her
friends
at
Highbury
,
as
they
can
be
to
see
her
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
Friday
or
Saturday
;
she
can
not
say
which
,
because
Colonel
Campbell
will
be
wanting
the
carriage
himself
one
of
those
days
.
<EOS>
So
very
good
of
them
to
send
her
the
whole
way
!
<EOS>
But
they
always
do
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
Oh
yes
,
Friday
or
Saturday
next
.
<EOS>
That
is
what
she
writes
about
.
<EOS>
That
is
the
reason
of
her
writing
out
of
rule
,
as
we
call
it
;
for
,
in
the
common
course
,
we
should
not
have
heard
from
her
before
next
Tuesday
or
Wednesday
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
so
I
imagined
.
<EOS>
I
was
afraid
there
could
be
little
chance
of
my
hearing
any
thing
of
Miss
Fairfax
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
So
obliging
of
you
!
<EOS>
No
,
we
should
not
have
heard
,
if
it
had
not
been
for
this
particular
circumstance
,
of
her
being
to
come
here
so
soon
.
<EOS>
My
mother
is
so
delighted
!
 
<EOS>
for
she
is
to
be
three
months
with
us
at
least
.
<EOS>
Three
months
,
she
says
so
,
positively
,
as
I
am
going
to
have
the
pleasure
of
reading
to
you
.
<EOS>
The
case
is
,
you
see
,
that
the
Campbells
are
going
to
Ireland
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Dixon
has
persuaded
her
father
and
mother
to
come
over
and
see
her
directly
.
<EOS>
They
had
not
intended
to
go
over
till
the
summer
,
but
she
is
so
impatient
to
see
them
again
 
for
till
she
married
,
last
October
,
she
was
never
away
from
them
so
much
as
a
week
,
which
must
make
it
very
strange
to
be
in
different
kingdoms
,
I
was
going
to
say
,
but
however
different
countries
,
and
so
she
wrote
a
very
urgent
letter
to
her
mother
 
or
her
father
<EOS>
,
I
declare
I
do
not
know
which
it
was
,
but
we
shall
see
presently
in
Jane
's
letter
 
wrote
in
Mr.
Dixon
's
name
as
well
as
her
own
,
to
press
their
coming
over
directly
,
and
they
would
give
them
the
meeting
in
Dublin
,
and
take
them
back
to
their
country
seat
,
Baly
-
craig
,
a
beautiful
place
,
I
fancy
.
<EOS>
Jane
has
heard
a
great
deal
of
its
beauty
;
from
Mr.
Dixon
,
I
mean
 
I
do
not
know
that
she
ever
heard
about
it
from
any
body
else
;
but
it
was
very
natural
,
you
know
,
that
he
should
like
to
speak
of
his
own
place
while
he
was
paying
his
addresses
 
and
as
Jane
used
to
be
very
often
walking
out
with
them
 
for
Colonel
and
Mrs.
Campbell
were
very
particular
about
their
daughter
's
not
walking
out
often
with
only
Mr.
Dixon
,
<EOS>
for
which
I
do
not
at
all
blame
them
;
of
course
she
heard
every
thing
he
might
be
telling
Miss
Campbell
about
his
own
home
in
Ireland
;
and
I
think
she
wrote
us
word
that
he
had
shewn
them
some
drawings
of
the
place
,
views
that
he
had
taken
himself
.
<EOS>
He
is
a
most
amiable
,
charming
young
man
,
I
believe
.
<EOS>
Jane
was
quite
longing
to
go
to
Ireland
,
from
his
account
of
things
.
"
  
<EOS>
At
this
moment
,
an
ingenious
and
animating
suspicion
entering
Emma
's
brain
with
regard
to
Jane
Fairfax
,
this
charming
Mr.
Dixon
,
and
the
not
going
to
Ireland
,
she
said
,
with
the
insidious
design
of
farther
discovery
,
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
feel
it
very
fortunate
that
Miss
Fairfax
should
be
allowed
to
come
to
you
at
such
a
time
.
<EOS>
Considering
the
very
particular
friendship
between
her
and
Mrs.
Dixon
,
you
could
hardly
have
expected
her
to
be
excused
from
accompanying
Colonel
and
Mrs.
Campbell
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Very
true
,
very
true
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
The
very
thing
that
we
have
always
been
rather
afraid
of
;
for
we
should
not
have
liked
to
have
her
at
such
a
distance
from
us
,
for
months
together
 
not
able
to
come
if
any
thing
was
to
happen
.
<EOS>
But
you
see
,
every
thing
turns
out
for
the
best
.
<EOS>
They
want
her
(
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Dixon
)
excessively
to
come
over
with
Colonel
and
Mrs.
Campbell
;
quite
depend
upon
it
;
nothing
can
be
more
kind
or
pressing
than
their
_
joint
_
invitation
,
Jane
says
,
as
you
will
hear
presently
;
Mr.
Dixon
does
not
seem
in
the
least
backward
in
any
attention
.
<EOS>
He
is
a
most
charming
young
man
.
<EOS>
Ever
since
the
service
he
rendered
Jane
at
Weymouth
,
when
they
were
out
in
that
party
on
the
water
,
and
she
,
by
the
sudden
whirling
round
of
something
or
other
among
the
sails
,
would
have
been
dashed
into
the
sea
at
once
,
and
actually
was
all
but
gone
,
if
he
had
not
,
with
the
greatest
presence
of
mind
,
caught
hold
of
her
habit
  
<EOS>
(
I
can
never
think
of
it
without
trembling
!
)
 
<EOS>
But
ever
since
we
had
the
history
of
that
day
,
I
have
been
so
fond
of
Mr.
Dixon
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
in
spite
of
all
her
friends
'
urgency
,
and
her
own
wish
of
seeing
Ireland
,
Miss
Fairfax
prefers
devoting
the
time
to
you
and
Mrs.
Bates
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
 
entirely
her
own
doing
,
entirely
her
own
choice
;
and
Colonel
and
Mrs.
Campbell
think
she
does
quite
right
,
just
what
they
should
recommend
;
and
indeed
they
particularly
_
wish
_
her
to
try
her
native
air
,
as
she
has
not
been
quite
so
well
as
usual
lately
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
concerned
to
hear
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
think
they
judge
wisely
.
<EOS>
But
Mrs.
Dixon
must
be
very
much
disappointed
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Dixon
,
I
understand
,
has
no
remarkable
degree
of
personal
beauty
;
is
not
,
by
any
means
,
to
be
compared
with
Miss
Fairfax
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
no
.
<EOS>
You
are
very
obliging
to
say
such
things
 
but
certainly
not
.
<EOS>
There
is
no
comparison
between
them
.
<EOS>
Miss
Campbell
always
was
absolutely
plain
 
but
extremely
elegant
and
amiable
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
that
of
course
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Jane
caught
a
bad
cold
,
poor
thing
!
<EOS>
so
long
ago
as
the
7th
of
November
,
(
as
I
am
going
to
read
to
you
,
)
and
has
never
been
well
since
.
<EOS>
A
long
time
,
is
not
it
,
for
a
cold
to
hang
upon
her
?
<EOS>
She
never
mentioned
it
before
,
because
she
would
not
alarm
us
.
<EOS>
Just
like
her
!
<EOS>
so
considerate
!
 
<EOS>
But
however
,
she
is
so
far
from
well
,
that
her
kind
friends
<EOS>
the
Campbells
think
she
had
better
come
home
,
and
try
an
air
that
always
agrees
with
her
;
and
they
have
no
doubt
that
three
or
four
months
at
Highbury
will
entirely
cure
her
 
and
it
is
certainly
a
great
deal
better
that
she
should
come
here
,
than
go
to
Ireland
,
if
she
is
unwell
.
<EOS>
Nobody
could
nurse
her
,
as
we
should
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
appears
to
me
the
most
desirable
arrangement
in
the
world
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
so
she
is
to
come
to
us
next
Friday
or
Saturday
,
and
the
Campbells
leave
town
in
their
way
to
Holyhead
the
Monday
following
 
as
you
will
find
from
Jane
's
letter
.
<EOS>
So
sudden
!
 
<EOS>
You
may
guess
,
dear
Miss
Woodhouse
,
what
a
flurry
<EOS>
it
has
thrown
me
in
!
<EOS>
If
it
was
not
for
the
drawback
of
her
illness
 
<EOS>
but
I
am
afraid
we
must
expect
to
see
her
grown
thin
,
and
looking
very
poorly
.
<EOS>
I
must
tell
you
what
an
unlucky
thing
happened
to
me
,
as
to
that
.
<EOS>
I
always
make
a
point
of
reading
Jane
's
letters
through
to
myself
first
,
before
I
read
them
aloud
to
my
mother
,
you
know
,
for
fear
of
there
being
any
thing
in
them
to
distress
her
.
<EOS>
Jane
desired
me
to
do
it
,
so
I
always
do
:
<EOS>
and
so
I
began
to
-
day
with
my
usual
caution
;
but
no
sooner
did
I
come
to
the
mention
of
her
being
unwell
,
than
I
burst
out
,
quite
frightened
,
with
"
Bless
me
!
<EOS>
poor
Jane
is
ill
!
"
 
<EOS>
which
my
mother
,
being
on
the
watch
,
heard
distinctly
,
and
was
sadly
alarmed
at
.
<EOS>
However
,
when
I
read
on
,
I
found
it
was
not
near
so
bad
as
I
had
fancied
at
first
;
and
I
make
so
light
of
it
now
to
her
,
that
she
does
not
think
much
about
it
.
<EOS>
But
I
can
not
imagine
how
I
could
be
so
off
my
guard
.
<EOS>
If
Jane
does
not
get
well
soon
,
we
will
call
in
Mr.
Perry
.
<EOS>
The
expense
shall
not
be
thought
of
;
and
though
he
is
so
liberal
,
and
so
fond
of
Jane
that
I
dare
say
he
would
not
mean
to
charge
any
thing
for
attendance
,
we
could
not
suffer
it
to
be
so
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
He
has
a
wife
and
family
to
maintain
,
and
is
not
to
be
giving
away
his
time
.
<EOS>
Well
,
now
I
have
just
given
you
a
hint
of
what
Jane
writes
about
,
we
will
turn
to
her
letter
,
and
I
am
sure
she
tells
her
own
story
a
great
deal
better
than
I
can
tell
it
for
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
afraid
we
must
be
running
away
,
"
said
Emma
,
glancing
at
Harriet
,
and
beginning
to
rise
 
<EOS>
"
My
father
will
be
expecting
us
.
<EOS>
I
had
no
intention
<EOS>
,
I
thought
I
had
no
power
of
staying
more
than
five
minutes
,
when
I
first
entered
the
house
.
<EOS>
I
merely
called
,
because
I
would
not
pass
the
door
without
inquiring
after
Mrs.
Bates
;
but
I
have
been
so
pleasantly
detained
!
<EOS>
Now
,
however
,
we
must
wish
you
and
Mrs.
Bates
good
morning
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
not
all
that
could
be
urged
to
detain
her
succeeded
.
<EOS>
She
regained
the
street
 
happy
in
this
,
that
though
much
had
been
forced
on
her
against
her
will
,
though
she
had
in
fact
heard
the
whole
substance
of
Jane
Fairfax
's
letter
,
she
had
been
able
to
escape
the
letter
itself
.
    
<EOS>
Jane
Fairfax
was
an
orphan
,
the
only
child
of
Mrs.
Bates
's
youngest
daughter
.
  
<EOS>
The
marriage
of
Lieut
.
<EOS>
Fairfax
of
the
regiment
of
infantry
,
and
Miss
Jane
Bates
,
had
had
its
day
of
fame
and
pleasure
,
hope
and
interest
;
but
nothing
now
remained
of
it
,
save
the
melancholy
remembrance
of
him
dying
in
action
abroad
 
of
his
widow
sinking
under
consumption
and
grief
soon
afterwards
 
and
this
girl
.
  
<EOS>
By
birth
she
belonged
to
Highbury
:
and
when
at
three
years
old
,
on
losing
her
mother
,
she
became
the
property
,
the
charge
,
the
consolation
,
the
fondling
of
her
grandmother
and
aunt
,
there
had
seemed
every
probability
of
her
being
permanently
fixed
there
;
of
her
being
taught
only
what
very
limited
means
could
command
,
and
growing
up
with
no
advantages
of
connexion
or
improvement
,
to
be
engrafted
on
what
nature
had
given
her
in
a
pleasing
person
,
good
understanding
,
and
warm
-
hearted
,
well
-
meaning
relations
.
  
<EOS>
But
the
compassionate
feelings
of
a
friend
of
her
father
gave
a
change
to
her
destiny
.
<EOS>
This
was
Colonel
Campbell
,
who
had
very
highly
regarded
Fairfax
,
as
an
excellent
officer
and
most
deserving
young
man
;
and
farther
,
had
been
indebted
to
him
for
such
attentions
,
during
a
severe
camp
-
fever
,
as
he
believed
had
saved
his
life
.
<EOS>
These
were
claims
which
he
did
not
learn
to
overlook
,
though
some
years
passed
away
from
the
death
of
poor
Fairfax
,
before
his
own
return
to
England
put
any
thing
in
his
power
.
<EOS>
When
he
did
return
,
he
sought
out
the
child
and
took
notice
of
her
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
married
man
,
with
only
one
living
child
,
a
girl
,
about
Jane
's
age
:
and
Jane
became
their
guest
,
paying
them
long
visits
and
growing
a
favourite
with
all
;
and
before
she
was
nine
years
old
,
his
daughter
's
great
fondness
for
her
,
and
his
own
wish
of
being
a
real
friend
,
united
to
produce
an
offer
from
Colonel
Campbell
of
undertaking
the
whole
charge
of
her
education
.
<EOS>
It
was
accepted
;
and
from
that
period
Jane
had
belonged
to
Colonel
Campbell
's
family
,
and
had
lived
with
them
entirely
,
only
visiting
her
grandmother
from
time
to
time
.
  
<EOS>
The
plan
was
that
she
should
be
brought
up
for
educating
others
;
the
very
few
hundred
pounds
which
she
inherited
from
her
father
making
independence
impossible
.
<EOS>
To
provide
for
her
otherwise
was
out
of
Colonel
Campbell
's
power
;
for
though
his
income
,
by
pay
and
appointments
,
was
handsome
,
his
fortune
was
moderate
and
must
be
all
his
daughter
's
;
but
,
by
giving
her
an
education
,
he
hoped
to
be
supplying
the
means
of
respectable
subsistence
hereafter
.
  
<EOS>
Such
was
Jane
Fairfax
's
history
.
<EOS>
She
had
fallen
into
good
hands
,
known
nothing
but
kindness
from
the
Campbells
,
and
been
given
an
excellent
education
.
<EOS>
Living
constantly
with
right
-
minded
and
well
-
informed
people
,
her
heart
and
understanding
had
received
every
advantage
of
discipline
and
culture
;
and
Colonel
Campbell
's
residence
being
in
London
,
every
lighter
talent
had
been
done
full
justice
to
,
by
the
attendance
of
first
-
rate
masters
.
<EOS>
Her
disposition
and
abilities
were
equally
worthy
of
all
that
friendship
could
do
;
and
at
eighteen
or
nineteen
she
was
,
as
far
as
such
an
early
age
can
be
qualified
for
the
care
of
children
,
fully
competent
to
the
office
of
instruction
herself
;
but
she
was
too
much
beloved
to
be
parted
with
.
<EOS>
Neither
father
nor
mother
could
promote
,
and
the
daughter
could
not
endure
it
.
<EOS>
The
evil
day
was
put
off
.
<EOS>
It
was
easy
to
decide
that
she
was
still
too
young
;
and
Jane
remained
with
them
,
sharing
,
as
another
daughter
,
in
all
the
rational
pleasures
of
an
elegant
society
,
and
a
judicious
mixture
of
home
and
amusement
,
with
only
the
drawback
of
the
future
,
the
sobering
suggestions
of
her
own
good
understanding
to
remind
her
that
all
this
might
soon
be
over
.
  
<EOS>
The
affection
of
the
whole
family
,
the
warm
attachment
of
Miss
Campbell
in
particular
,
was
the
more
honourable
to
each
party
from
the
circumstance
of
Jane
's
decided
superiority
both
in
beauty
and
acquirements
.
<EOS>
That
nature
had
given
it
in
feature
could
not
be
unseen
by
the
young
woman
,
nor
could
her
higher
powers
of
mind
be
unfelt
by
the
parents
.
<EOS>
They
continued
together
with
unabated
regard
however
,
till
the
marriage
of
Miss
Campbell
,
who
by
that
chance
,
that
luck
which
so
often
defies
anticipation
in
matrimonial
affairs
,
giving
attraction
to
what
is
moderate
rather
than
to
what
is
superior
,
engaged
the
affections
of
Mr.
Dixon
,
a
young
man
,
rich
and
agreeable
,
almost
as
soon
as
they
were
acquainted
;
and
was
eligibly
and
happily
settled
,
while
Jane
Fairfax
had
yet
her
bread
to
earn
.
  
<EOS>
This
event
had
very
lately
taken
place
;
too
lately
for
any
thing
to
be
yet
attempted
by
her
less
fortunate
friend
towards
entering
on
her
path
of
duty
;
though
she
had
now
reached
the
age
which
her
own
judgment
had
fixed
on
for
beginning
.
<EOS>
She
had
long
resolved
that
one
-
and
-
twenty
should
be
the
period
.
<EOS>
With
the
fortitude
of
a
devoted
novitiate
,
she
had
resolved
at
one
-
and
-
twenty
to
complete
the
sacrifice
,
and
retire
from
all
the
pleasures
of
life
,
of
rational
intercourse
,
equal
society
,
peace
and
hope
,
to
penance
and
mortification
for
ever
.
  
<EOS>
The
good
sense
of
Colonel
and
Mrs.
Campbell
could
not
oppose
such
a
resolution
,
though
their
feelings
did
.
<EOS>
As
long
as
they
lived
,
no
exertions
would
be
necessary
,
their
home
might
be
hers
for
ever
;
and
for
their
own
comfort
they
would
have
retained
her
wholly
;
but
this
would
be
selfishness
:
 
what
must
be
at
last
,
had
better
be
soon
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
they
began
to
feel
it
might
have
been
kinder
and
wiser
to
have
resisted
the
temptation
of
any
delay
,
and
spared
her
from
a
taste
of
such
enjoyments
of
ease
and
leisure
as
must
now
be
relinquished
.
<EOS>
Still
,
however
,
affection
was
glad
to
catch
at
any
reasonable
excuse
for
not
hurrying
on
the
wretched
moment
.
<EOS>
She
had
never
been
quite
well
since
the
time
of
their
daughter
's
marriage
;
and
till
she
should
have
completely
recovered
her
usual
strength
,
they
must
forbid
her
engaging
in
duties
,
which
,
so
far
from
being
compatible
with
a
weakened
frame
and
varying
spirits
,
seemed
,
under
the
most
favourable
circumstances
,
to
require
something
more
than
human
perfection
of
body
and
mind
to
be
discharged
with
tolerable
comfort
.
  
<EOS>
With
regard
to
her
not
accompanying
them
to
Ireland
,
her
account
to
her
aunt
contained
nothing
but
truth
,
though
there
might
be
some
truths
not
told
.
<EOS>
It
was
her
own
choice
to
give
the
time
of
their
absence
to
Highbury
;
to
spend
,
perhaps
,
her
last
months
of
perfect
liberty
with
those
kind
relations
to
whom
she
was
so
very
dear
:
and
the
Campbells
,
whatever
might
be
their
motive
or
motives
,
whether
single
,
or
double
,
or
treble
,
gave
the
arrangement
their
ready
sanction
,
and
said
,
that
they
depended
more
on
a
few
months
spent
in
her
native
air
,
for
the
recovery
of
her
health
,
than
on
any
thing
else
.
<EOS>
Certain
it
was
that
she
was
to
come
;
and
that
Highbury
,
instead
of
welcoming
that
perfect
novelty
which
had
been
so
long
promised
it
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
 
must
put
up
for
the
present
with
Jane
Fairfax
,
who
could
bring
only
the
freshness
of
a
two
years
'
absence
.
  
<EOS>
Emma
was
sorry
;
 
to
have
to
pay
civilities
to
a
person
she
did
not
like
through
three
long
months
!
 
<EOS>
to
be
always
doing
more
than
she
wished
,
and
less
than
she
ought
!
<EOS>
Why
she
did
not
like
Jane
Fairfax
might
be
a
difficult
question
to
answer
;
Mr.
Knightley
had
once
told
her
it
was
because
she
saw
in
her
the
really
accomplished
young
woman
,
which
she
wanted
to
be
thought
herself
;
and
though
the
accusation
had
been
eagerly
refuted
at
the
time
,
there
were
moments
of
self
-
examination
in
which
her
conscience
could
not
quite
acquit
her
.
<EOS>
But
"
she
could
never
get
acquainted
with
her
:
she
did
not
know
how
it
was
,
but
there
was
such
coldness
and
reserve
 
such
apparent
indifference
whether
she
pleased
or
not
 
<EOS>
and
then
,
her
aunt
was
such
an
eternal
talker
!
 
<EOS>
and
she
was
made
such
a
fuss
with
by
every
body
!
 
<EOS>
and
it
had
been
always
imagined
that
they
were
to
be
so
intimate
 
<EOS>
because
their
ages
were
the
same
,
every
body
had
supposed
they
must
be
so
fond
of
each
other
.
<EOS>
"
These
were
her
reasons
 
she
had
no
better
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
dislike
so
little
just
 
<EOS>
every
imputed
fault
was
so
magnified
by
fancy
,
that
she
never
saw
Jane
Fairfax
the
first
time
after
any
considerable
absence
,
without
feeling
that
she
had
injured
her
;
and
now
,
when
the
due
visit
was
paid
,
on
her
arrival
,
after
a
two
years
'
interval
,
she
was
particularly
struck
with
the
very
appearance
and
manners
,
which
for
those
two
whole
years
she
had
been
depreciating
.
<EOS>
Jane
Fairfax
was
very
elegant
,
remarkably
elegant
;
and
she
had
herself
the
highest
value
for
elegance
.
<EOS>
Her
height
was
pretty
,
just
such
as
almost
every
body
would
think
tall
,
and
nobody
could
think
very
tall
;
her
figure
particularly
graceful
;
her
size
a
most
becoming
medium
,
between
fat
and
thin
,
though
a
slight
appearance
of
ill
-
health
seemed
to
point
out
the
likeliest
evil
of
the
two
.
<EOS>
Emma
could
not
but
feel
all
this
;
and
then
,
her
face
 
<EOS>
her
features
 
<EOS>
there
was
more
beauty
in
them
altogether
than
she
had
remembered
;
it
was
not
regular
,
but
it
was
very
pleasing
beauty
.
<EOS>
Her
eyes
,
a
deep
grey
,
with
dark
eye
-
lashes
and
eyebrows
,
had
never
been
denied
their
praise
;
but
the
skin
,
which
she
had
been
used
to
cavil
at
,
as
wanting
colour
,
had
a
clearness
and
delicacy
which
really
needed
no
fuller
bloom
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
style
of
beauty
,
of
which
elegance
was
the
reigning
character
,
and
as
such
,
she
must
,
in
honour
,
by
all
her
principles
,
admire
it
:
 
elegance
,
which
,
whether
of
person
or
of
mind
,
she
saw
so
little
in
Highbury
.
<EOS>
There
,
not
to
be
vulgar
,
was
distinction
,
and
merit
.
  
<EOS>
In
short
,
she
sat
,
during
the
first
visit
,
looking
at
Jane
Fairfax
with
twofold
complacency
;
the
sense
of
pleasure
and
the
sense
of
rendering
justice
,
and
was
determining
that
she
would
dislike
her
no
longer
.
<EOS>
When
she
took
in
her
history
,
indeed
,
her
situation
,
as
well
as
her
beauty
;
when
she
considered
what
all
this
elegance
was
destined
to
,
what
she
was
going
to
sink
from
,
how
she
was
going
to
live
,
it
seemed
impossible
to
feel
any
thing
but
compassion
and
respect
;
especially
,
if
to
every
well
-
known
particular
entitling
her
to
interest
,
were
added
the
highly
probable
circumstance
of
an
attachment
to
Mr.
Dixon
,
which
she
had
so
naturally
started
to
herself
.
<EOS>
In
that
case
,
nothing
could
be
more
pitiable
or
more
honourable
than
the
sacrifices
she
had
resolved
on
.
<EOS>
Emma
was
very
willing
now
to
acquit
her
of
having
seduced
Mr.
Dixon
's
actions
from
his
wife
,
or
of
any
thing
mischievous
which
her
imagination
had
suggested
at
first
.
<EOS>
If
it
were
love
,
it
might
be
simple
,
single
,
successless
love
on
her
side
alone
.
<EOS>
She
might
have
been
unconsciously
sucking
in
the
sad
poison
,
while
a
sharer
of
his
conversation
with
her
friend
;
and
from
the
best
,
the
purest
of
motives
,
might
now
be
denying
herself
this
visit
to
Ireland
,
and
resolving
to
divide
herself
effectually
from
him
and
his
connexions
by
soon
beginning
her
career
of
laborious
duty
.
  
<EOS>
Upon
the
whole
,
Emma
left
her
with
such
softened
,
charitable
feelings
,
as
made
her
look
around
in
walking
home
,
and
lament
that
Highbury
afforded
no
young
man
worthy
of
giving
her
independence
;
nobody
that
she
could
wish
to
scheme
about
for
her
.
  
<EOS>
These
were
charming
feelings
 
but
not
lasting
.
<EOS>
Before
she
had
committed
herself
by
any
public
profession
of
eternal
friendship
for
Jane
Fairfax
,
or
done
more
towards
a
recantation
of
past
prejudices
and
errors
,
than
saying
to
Mr.
Knightley
,
"
She
certainly
is
handsome
;
she
is
better
than
handsome
!
"
<EOS>
Jane
had
spent
an
evening
at
Hartfield
with
her
grandmother
and
aunt
,
and
every
thing
was
relapsing
much
into
its
usual
state
.
<EOS>
Former
provocations
reappeared
.
<EOS>
The
aunt
was
as
tiresome
as
ever
;
more
tiresome
,
because
anxiety
for
her
health
was
now
added
to
admiration
of
her
powers
;
and
they
had
to
listen
to
the
description
of
exactly
how
little
bread
and
butter
she
ate
for
breakfast
,
and
how
small
a
slice
of
mutton
for
dinner
,
as
well
as
to
see
exhibitions
of
new
caps
and
new
workbags
for
her
mother
and
herself
;
and
Jane
's
offences
rose
again
.
<EOS>
They
had
music
;
Emma
was
obliged
to
play
;
and
the
thanks
and
praise
which
necessarily
followed
appeared
to
her
an
affectation
of
candour
,
an
air
of
greatness
,
meaning
only
to
shew
off
in
higher
style
her
own
very
superior
performance
.
<EOS>
She
was
,
besides
,
which
was
the
worst
of
all
,
so
cold
,
so
cautious
!
<EOS>
There
was
no
getting
at
her
real
opinion
.
<EOS>
Wrapt
up
in
a
cloak
of
politeness
,
she
seemed
determined
to
hazard
nothing
.
<EOS>
She
was
disgustingly
,
was
suspiciously
reserved
.
  
<EOS>
If
any
thing
could
be
more
,
where
all
was
most
,
she
was
more
reserved
on
the
subject
of
Weymouth
and
the
Dixons
than
any
thing
.
<EOS>
She
seemed
bent
on
giving
no
real
insight
into
Mr.
Dixon
's
character
,
or
her
own
value
for
his
company
,
or
opinion
of
the
suitableness
of
the
match
.
<EOS>
It
was
all
general
approbation
and
smoothness
;
nothing
delineated
or
distinguished
.
<EOS>
It
did
her
no
service
however
.
<EOS>
Her
caution
was
thrown
away
.
<EOS>
Emma
saw
its
artifice
,
and
returned
to
her
first
surmises
.
<EOS>
There
probably
_
was
_
something
more
to
conceal
than
her
own
preference
;
Mr.
Dixon
,
perhaps
,
had
been
very
near
changing
one
friend
for
the
other
,
or
been
fixed
only
to
Miss
Campbell
,
for
the
sake
of
the
future
twelve
thousand
pounds
.
  
<EOS>
The
like
reserve
prevailed
on
other
topics
.
<EOS>
She
and
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
had
been
at
Weymouth
at
the
same
time
.
<EOS>
It
was
known
that
they
were
a
little
acquainted
;
but
not
a
syllable
of
real
information
could
Emma
procure
as
to
what
he
truly
was
.
<EOS>
"
Was
he
handsome
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
She
believed
he
was
reckoned
a
very
fine
young
man
.
"
<EOS>
"
Was
he
agreeable
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
was
generally
thought
so
.
"
<EOS>
"
Did
he
appear
a
sensible
young
man
;
a
young
man
of
information
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
At
a
watering
-
place
,
or
in
a
common
London
acquaintance
,
it
was
difficult
to
decide
on
such
points
.
<EOS>
Manners
were
all
that
could
be
safely
judged
of
,
under
a
much
longer
knowledge
than
they
had
yet
had
of
Mr.
Churchill
.
<EOS>
She
believed
every
body
found
his
manners
pleasing
.
<EOS>
"
Emma
could
not
forgive
her
.
    
<EOS>
Emma
could
not
forgive
her
;
 
but
as
neither
provocation
nor
resentment
were
discerned
by
Mr.
Knightley
,
who
had
been
of
the
party
,
and
had
seen
only
proper
attention
and
pleasing
behaviour
on
each
side
,
he
was
expressing
the
next
morning
,
being
at
Hartfield
again
on
business
with
Mr.
Woodhouse
,
his
approbation
of
the
whole
;
not
so
openly
as
he
might
have
done
had
her
father
been
out
of
the
room
,
but
speaking
plain
enough
to
be
very
intelligible
to
Emma
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
used
to
think
her
unjust
to
Jane
,
and
had
now
great
pleasure
in
marking
an
improvement
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
very
pleasant
evening
<EOS>
,
"
he
began
,
as
soon
as
Mr.
Woodhouse
had
been
talked
into
what
was
necessary
,
told
that
he
understood
,
and
the
papers
swept
away
;
 
"
particularly
pleasant
.
<EOS>
You
and
Miss
Fairfax
gave
us
some
very
good
music
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
a
more
luxurious
state
,
sir
,
than
sitting
at
one
's
ease
to
be
entertained
a
whole
evening
by
two
such
young
women
;
sometimes
with
music
and
sometimes
with
conversation
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
Miss
Fairfax
must
have
found
the
evening
pleasant
,
Emma
.
<EOS>
You
left
nothing
undone
.
<EOS>
I
was
glad
you
made
her
play
so
much
,
for
having
no
instrument
at
her
grandmother
's
,
it
must
have
been
a
real
indulgence
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
happy
you
approved
,
"
said
Emma
,
smiling
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
hope
I
am
not
often
deficient
in
what
is
due
to
guests
at
Hartfield
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
my
dear
,
"
said
her
father
instantly
;
"
_
that
_
<EOS>
I
am
sure
you
are
not
.
<EOS>
There
is
nobody
half
so
attentive
and
civil
as
you
are
.
<EOS>
If
any
thing
,
you
are
too
attentive
.
<EOS>
The
muffin
last
night
 
if
it
had
been
handed
round
once
,
I
think
it
would
have
been
enough
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Mr.
Knightley
,
nearly
at
the
same
time
;
<EOS>
"
you
are
not
often
deficient
;
not
often
deficient
either
in
manner
or
comprehension
.
<EOS>
I
think
you
understand
me
,
therefore
.
"
  
<EOS>
An
arch
look
expressed
 
<EOS>
"
I
understand
you
well
enough
;
"
but
she
said
only
,
"
Miss
Fairfax
is
reserved
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
always
told
you
she
was
 
a
little
;
but
you
will
soon
overcome
all
that
part
of
her
reserve
which
ought
to
be
overcome
,
all
that
has
its
foundation
in
diffidence
.
<EOS>
What
arises
from
discretion
must
be
honoured
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
think
her
diffident
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
see
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Emma
,
"
said
he
,
moving
from
his
chair
into
one
close
by
her
,
"
you
are
not
going
to
tell
me
,
<EOS>
I
hope
,
that
you
had
not
a
pleasant
evening
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
no
;
I
was
pleased
with
my
own
perseverance
in
asking
questions
;
and
amused
to
think
how
little
information
I
obtained
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
disappointed
,
"
was
his
only
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
every
body
had
a
pleasant
evening
,
"
said
Mr.
Woodhouse
,
in
his
quiet
way
.
<EOS>
"
I
had
.
<EOS>
Once
,
I
felt
the
fire
rather
too
much
;
but
then
I
moved
back
my
chair
a
little
,
a
very
little
,
and
it
did
not
disturb
me
.
<EOS>
Miss
Bates
was
very
chatty
and
good
-
humoured
,
as
she
always
is
,
though
she
speaks
rather
too
quick
.
<EOS>
However
,
she
is
very
agreeable
,
and
Mrs.
Bates
too
,
in
a
different
way
.
<EOS>
I
like
old
friends
;
and
Miss
Jane
Fairfax
is
a
very
pretty
sort
of
young
lady
,
a
very
pretty
and
a
very
well
-
behaved
young
lady
indeed
.
<EOS>
She
must
have
found
the
evening
agreeable
,
Mr.
Knightley
,
because
she
had
Emma
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
True
,
sir
;
and
Emma
,
because
she
had
Miss
Fairfax
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
saw
his
anxiety
,
and
wishing
to
appease
it
,
at
least
for
the
present
,
said
,
and
with
a
sincerity
which
no
one
could
question
    
<EOS>
"
She
is
a
sort
of
elegant
creature
that
one
can
not
keep
one
's
eyes
from
.
<EOS>
I
am
always
watching
her
to
admire
;
and
I
do
pity
her
from
my
heart
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Knightley
looked
as
if
he
were
more
gratified
than
he
cared
to
express
;
and
before
he
could
make
any
reply
,
Mr.
Woodhouse
,
whose
thoughts
were
on
the
Bates
's
,
said
    
"
It
is
a
great
pity
that
their
circumstances
should
be
so
confined
!
<EOS>
a
great
pity
indeed
!
<EOS>
and
I
have
often
wished
 
<EOS>
but
it
is
so
little
one
can
venture
to
do
 
small
,
trifling
presents
,
of
any
thing
uncommon
 
<EOS>
Now
we
have
killed
a
porker
,
and
Emma
thinks
of
sending
them
a
loin
or
a
leg
;
it
is
very
small
and
delicate
 
<EOS>
Hartfield
pork
is
not
like
any
other
pork
 
<EOS>
but
still
it
is
pork
 
<EOS>
and
,
my
dear
Emma
,
unless
one
could
be
sure
of
their
making
it
into
steaks
,
nicely
fried
,
as
ours
are
fried
,
without
the
smallest
grease
,
and
not
roast
it
,
for
no
stomach
can
bear
roast
pork
 
<EOS>
I
think
we
had
better
send
the
leg
 
<EOS>
do
not
you
think
so
,
my
dear
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
papa
,
I
sent
the
whole
hind
-
quarter
.
<EOS>
I
knew
you
would
wish
it
.
<EOS>
There
will
be
the
leg
to
be
salted
,
you
know
,
which
is
so
very
nice
,
and
the
loin
to
be
dressed
directly
in
any
manner
they
like
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
right
,
my
dear
,
very
right
.
<EOS>
I
had
not
thought
of
it
before
,
but
that
is
the
best
way
.
<EOS>
They
must
not
over
-
salt
the
leg
;
and
then
,
if
it
is
not
over
-
salted
,
and
if
it
is
very
thoroughly
boiled
,
just
as
Serle
boils
ours
,
and
eaten
very
moderately
of
,
with
a
boiled
turnip
,
and
a
little
carrot
or
parsnip
,
I
do
not
consider
it
unwholesome
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Emma
,
"
said
Mr.
Knightley
presently
,
"
I
have
a
piece
of
news
for
you

<EOS>
You
like
news

I
heard

News

<EOS>
Oh

yes

I
always

news

it

why
do
you
smile
so

where
did
you
hear
it

<EOS>
at

<EOS>
He
had
time
only
to
say
,
  
"
No
,
not
at
Randalls
;
I
have
not
been
near
Randalls
,
"
when
the
door
was
thrown
open
,
and
Miss
Bates
and
Miss
Fairfax
walked
into
the
room
.
<EOS>
Full
of
thanks
,
and
full
of
news
,
Miss
Bates
knew
not
which
to
give
quickest
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Knightley
soon
saw
that
he
had
lost
his
moment
,
and
that
not
another
syllable
of
communication
could
rest
with
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh

<EOS>
my
dear
sir
,
how
are
you
this
morning
?
<EOS>
My

Miss
Woodhouse

I
come
quite
over

Such
a
beautiful
hind

quarter

pork

You

too
bountiful

Have
you
heard
the
news
?
<EOS>
Mr.
Elton
is
going
to
be
married
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
had
not
had
time
even
to
think
of
Mr.
Elton
,
and
she
was
so
completely
surprized
that
she
could
not
avoid
a
little
start
,
and
a
little
blush
,
at
the
sound
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
my
news
:
 
<EOS>
I
thought
it
would
interest
you
,
"
said
Mr.
Knightley
,
with
a
smile
which
implied
a
conviction
of
some
part
of
what
had
passed
between
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
where
could
_
<EOS>
you
<EOS>
_
hear
it
?
"
cried
Miss
Bates
.
<EOS>
"
Where
could
you
possibly
hear
it
,
Mr.
Knightley
?
<EOS>
For
it
is
not
five
minutes
since
I
received
Mrs.
Cole
's
note
 
<EOS>
no
,
it
can
not
be
more
than
five
 
or
at

ten
 
<EOS>
for
I
had
got
my
bonnet
and
spencer
on
,
just
ready
to
come
out
 
<EOS>
I
was
only
gone
down
to
speak
to
Patty
again
about
the
pork
 
Jane
was
standing
in
the
passage
 
<EOS>
were
not
you

Jane

large

So
I
said
I
would
go
down
and
see
,
and
Jane
said
,
"
Shall
I
go
down
instead
?
<EOS>
for
I
think
you
have
a
little
cold
,
and
Patty
has
been
washing
the
kitchen
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
<EOS>
my
dear
,
"
said
I
 
well
,
and
just
then
came
the
note
.
<EOS>
A
Miss
Hawkins
 
<EOS>
that
's
all
I
know
.
<EOS>
A
Miss
Hawkins
of
Bath
.
<EOS>
But
,
Mr.
Knightley
,
how
could
you
possibly
have
heard
it
?
<EOS>
for
the
very
moment
Mr.
Cole
told
Mrs.
Cole
of
it
,
she
sat
down
and
wrote
to
me
.
<EOS>
A
Miss
Hawkins
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
was
with
Mr.
Cole
on
business
an
hour
and
a
half
ago
.
<EOS>
He
had
just
read
Elton
's
letter
as
I
was
shewn
in
,
and
handed
it
to
me
directly
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
that
is
quite
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
there
never
was
a
piece
of
news
more
generally
interesting
.
<EOS>
My
dear
sir
,
you
really
are
too
bountiful
.
<EOS>
My
mother
desires
her
very
best
compliments
and
regards
,
and
a
thousand
thanks
,
and
says
you
really
quite
oppress
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
consider
our
Hartfield
pork
,
"
replied
Mr.
Woodhouse
 
<EOS>
"
indeed
it
certainly
is
,
so
very
superior
to
all
other
pork
,
that
Emma
and
I
can
not
have
a
greater
pleasure
than
 
"
  
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
my
dear
sir
,
as
my
mother
says
,
our
friends
are
only
too
good
to
us
.
<EOS>
If
ever
there
were
people
who
,
without
having
great
wealth
themselves
,
had
every
thing
they
could
wish
for
,
I
am
sure
it
is
us
.
<EOS>
We
may
well
say
that
"
our
lot
is
cast
in
a
goodly
heritage
.
"
<EOS>
Well
,
Mr.
Knightley
,
and
so
you
actually
saw
the
letter
;
well
 
"
  
"
It
was
short
 
merely
to
announce
 
but
cheerful
,
exulting
,
of
course
.
"
  
<EOS>
Here
was
a
sly
glance
at
Emma
.
<EOS>
"
He
had
been
so
fortunate
as
to
 
<EOS>
I
forget
the
precise
words
 
one
has
no
business
to
remember
them
.
<EOS>
The
information
was
,
as
you
state
,
that
he
was
going
to
be
married
to
a
Miss
Hawkins
.
<EOS>
By
his
style
,
I
should
imagine
it
just
settled
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Elton
going
to
be
married
!
"
<EOS>
said
Emma
,
as
soon
as
she
could
speak
.
"
<EOS>
He
will
have
every
body
's
wishes
for
his
happiness
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
very
young
to
settle
,
"
was
Mr.
Woodhouse
's
observation
.
"
<EOS>
He
had
better
not
be
in
a
hurry
.
<EOS>
He
seemed
to
me
very
well
off
as
he
was
.
<EOS>
We
were
always
glad
to
see
him
at
Hartfield
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
new
neighbour
for
us
all
,
Miss
Woodhouse
!
"
said
Miss
Bates
,
joyfully
;
"
my
mother
is
so
pleased
!
 
<EOS>
she
says
she
can
not
bear
to
have
the
poor
old
Vicarage
without
a
mistress
.
<EOS>
This
is
great
news
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
Jane
,
you
have
never
seen
Mr.
Elton
!
 
<EOS>
no
wonder
that
you
have
such
a
curiosity
to
see
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
Jane
's
curiosity
did
not
appear
of
that
absorbing
nature
as
wholly
to
occupy
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
 
I
have
never
seen
Mr.
Elton
,
"
she
replied
,
starting
on
this
appeal
;
"
is
he
 
<EOS>
is
he
a
tall
man
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Who
shall
answer
that
question
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Emma
.
<EOS>
"
My
father
would
say
"
yes
,
"
Mr.
Knightley
"
no
;
"
and
Miss
Bates
and
I
that
he
is
just
the
happy
medium
.
<EOS>
When
you
have
been
here
a
little
longer
,
Miss
Fairfax
,
you
will
understand
that
Mr.
Elton
is
the
standard
of
perfection
in
Highbury
,
both
in
person
and
mind
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
true
,
Miss
Woodhouse
,
so
she
will
.
<EOS>
He
is
the
very
best
young
man
 
<EOS>
But
,
my
dear
Jane
,
if
you
remember
,
I
told
you
yesterday
he
was
precisely
the
height
of
Mr.
Perry
.
<EOS>
Miss
Hawkins
,
 
<EOS>
I
dare
say
,
an
excellent
young
woman
.
<EOS>
His
extreme
attention
to
my
mother
 
wanting
her
to
sit
in
the
vicarage
pew
,
that
she
might
hear
the
better
,
for
my
mother
is
a
little
deaf
,
you
know
 
<EOS>
it
is
not
much
,
but
she
does
not
hear
quite
quick
.
<EOS>
Jane
says
that
Colonel
Campbell
is
a
little
deaf
.
<EOS>
He
fancied
bathing
might
be
good
for
it
 
<EOS>
the
warm
bath
 
<EOS>
but
she
says
it
did
him
no
lasting
benefit
.
<EOS>
Colonel
Campbell
,
you
know
,
is
quite
our
angel
.
<EOS>
And
Mr.
Dixon
seems
a
very
charming
young
man
,
quite
worthy
of
him
.
<EOS>
It
is
such
a
happiness
when
good
people
get
together
 
<EOS>
and
they
always
do
.
<EOS>
Now
,
here
will
be
Mr.
Elton
and
Miss
Hawkins
;
and
there
are
the
Coles
,
such
very
good
people
;
and
the
Perrys
 
I
suppose
there
never
was
a
happier
or
a
better
couple
than
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Perry
.
<EOS>
I
say
,
sir
,
"
turning
to
Mr.
Woodhouse
,
"
I
think
there
are
few
places
with
such
society
as
Highbury
.
<EOS>
I
always
say
,
we
are
quite
blessed
in
our
neighbours
.
 
<EOS>
My
dear
sir
,
if
there
is
one
thing
my
mother
loves
better
than
another
,
it
is
pork
 
<EOS>
a
roast
loin
of
pork
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
As
to
who
,
or
what
Miss
Hawkins
is
,
or
how
long
he
has
been
acquainted
with
her
,
"
said
Emma
,
"
nothing
I
suppose
can
be
known
.
<EOS>
One
feels
that
it
can
not
be
a
very
long
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
He
has
been
gone
only
four
weeks
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Nobody
had
any
information
to
give
;
and
,
after
a
few
more
wonderings
,
Emma
said
,
  
"
You
are
silent
,
Miss
Fairfax
 
<EOS>
but
I
hope
you
mean
to
take
an
interest
in
this
news
.
<EOS>
You
,
who
have
been
hearing
and
seeing
so
much
of
late
on
these
subjects
,
who
must
have
been
so
deep
in
the
business
on
Miss
Campbell
's
account
 
<EOS>
we
shall
not
excuse
your
being
indifferent
about
Mr.
Elton
and
Miss
Hawkins
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
When
I
have
seen
Mr.
Elton
,
"
replied
Jane
,
"
I
dare
say
I
shall
be
interested
 
<EOS>
but
I
believe
it
requires
_
that
_
with
me
.
<EOS>
And
as
it
is
some
months
since
Miss
Campbell
married
,
the
impression
may
be
a
little
worn
off
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
he
has
been
gone
just
four
weeks
,
as
you
observe
,
Miss
Woodhouse
,
"
said
Miss
Bates
,
"
four
weeks
yesterday
.
 
<EOS>
A
Miss
Hawkins
!
 
<EOS>
Well
,
I
had
always
rather
fancied
it
would
be
some
young
lady
hereabouts
;
not
that
I
ever
 
Mrs.
Cole
once
whispered
to
me
 
<EOS>
but
I
immediately
said
,
"
No
,
Mr.
Elton
is
a
most
worthy
young
man
 
but
'
 
In
short
,
I
do
not
think
I
am
particularly
quick
at
those
sort
of
discoveries
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
pretend
to
it
.
<EOS>
What
is
before
me
,
I
see
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
,
nobody
could
wonder
if
Mr.
Elton
should
have
aspired
 
<EOS>
Miss
Woodhouse
lets
me
chatter
on
,
so
good
-
humouredly
.
<EOS>
She
knows
I
would
not
offend
for
the
world
.
<EOS>
How
does
Miss
Smith
do
?
<EOS>
She
seems
quite
recovered
now
.
<EOS>
Have
you
heard
from
Mrs.
John
Knightley
lately
?
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
those
dear
little
children
.
<EOS>
Jane
,
do
you
know
I
always
fancy
Mr.
Dixon
like
Mr.
John
Knightley
.
<EOS>
I
mean
in
person
 
tall
,
and
with
that
sort
of
look
 
and
not
very
talkative
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Quite
wrong
,
my
dear
aunt
;
there
is
no
likeness
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
odd
!
<EOS>
but
one
never
does
form
a
just
idea
of
any
body
beforehand
.
<EOS>
One
takes
up
a
notion
,
and
runs
away
with
it
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Dixon
,
you
say
,
is
not
,
strictly
speaking
,
handsome
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Handsome
!
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
no
 
far
from
it
 
certainly
plain
.
<EOS>
I
told
you
he
was
plain
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
you
said
that
Miss
Campbell
would
not
allow
him
to
be
plain
,
and
that
you
yourself
 
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
as
for
me
,
my
judgment
is
worth
nothing
.
<EOS>
Where
I
have
a
regard
,
I
always
think
a
person
well
-
looking
.
<EOS>
But
I
gave
what
I
believed
the
general
opinion
,
when
I
called
him
plain
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
my
dear
Jane
,
I
believe
we
must
be
running
away
.
<EOS>
The
weather
does
not
look
well
,
and
grandmama
will
be
uneasy
.
<EOS>
You
are
too
obliging
,
my
dear
Miss
Woodhouse
;
but
we
really
must
take
leave
.
<EOS>
This
has
been
a
most
agreeable
piece
of
news
indeed
.
<EOS>
I
shall
just
go
round
by
Mrs.
Cole
's
;
but
I
shall
not
stop
three
minutes
:
and
,
Jane
,
you
had
better
go
home
directly
 
<EOS>
I
would
not
have
you
out
in
a
shower
!
 
<EOS>
We
think
she
is
the
better
for
Highbury
already
.
<EOS>
Thank
you
,
we
do
indeed
.
<EOS>
I
shall
not
attempt
calling
on
Mrs.
Goddard
,
for
I
really
do
not
think
she
cares
for
any
thing
but
<EOS>
_
boiled
_
pork
<EOS>
:
when
we
dress
the
leg
it
will
be
another
thing
.
<EOS>
Good
morning
to
you
,
<EOS>
my
dear
sir
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
Mr.
Knightley
is
coming
too
.
<EOS>
Well
,
that
is
so
very
!
 
<EOS>
I
am
sure
if
Jane
is
tired
,
you
will
be
so
kind
as
to
give
her
your
arm
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Elton
,
and
Miss
Hawkins
!
 
<EOS>
Good
morning
to
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
,
alone
with
her
father
,
had
half
her
attention
wanted
by
him
while
he
lamented
that
young
people
would
be
in
such
a
hurry
to
marry
 
and
to
marry
strangers
too
 
and
the
other
half
she
could
give
to
her
own
view
of
the
subject
.
<EOS>
It
was
to
herself
an
amusing
and
a
very
welcome
piece
of
news
,
as
proving
that
Mr.
Elton
could
not
have
suffered
long
;
but
she
was
sorry
for
Harriet
:
<EOS>
Harriet
must
feel
it
 
and
all
that
she
could
hope
was
,
by
giving
the
first
information
herself
,
to
save
her
from
hearing
it
abruptly
from
others
.
<EOS>
It
was
now
about
the
time
that
she
was
likely
to
call
.
<EOS>
If
she
were
to
meet
Miss
Bates
in
her
way
!
 
<EOS>
and
upon
its
beginning
to
rain
,
Emma
was
obliged
to
expect
that
the
weather
would
be
detaining
her
at
Mrs.
Goddard
's
,
and
that
the
intelligence
would
undoubtedly
rush
upon
her
without
preparation
.
  
<EOS>
The
shower
was
heavy
,
but
short
;
and
it
had
not
been
over
five
minutes
,
when
in
came
Harriet
,
with
just
the
heated
,
agitated
look
which
hurrying
thither
with
a
full
heart
was
likely
to
give
;
and
the
"
Oh
!
Miss
Woodhouse
,
what
do
you
think
has
happened
!
"
<EOS>
which
instantly
burst
forth
,
had
all
the
evidence
of
corresponding
perturbation
.
<EOS>
As
the
blow
was
given
,
Emma
felt
that
she
could
not
now
shew
greater
kindness
than
in
listening
;
and
Harriet
,
unchecked
,
ran
eagerly
through
what
she
had
to
tell
.
"
<EOS>
She
had
set
out
from
Mrs.
Goddard
's
<EOS>
half
an
hour
ago
 
she
had
been
afraid
it
would
rain
 
<EOS>
she
had
been
afraid
it
would
pour
down
every
moment
 
<EOS>
but
she
thought
she
might
get
to
Hartfield
first
 
<EOS>
she
had
hurried
on
as
fast
as
possible
;
but
then
,
as
she
was
passing
by
the
house
where
a
young
woman
was
making
up
a
gown
for
her
,
she
thought
she
would
just
step
in
and
see
how
it
went
on
;
and
though
she
did
not
seem
to
stay
half
a
moment
there
,
soon
after
she
came
out
it
began
to
rain
,
and
she
did
not
know
what
to
do
;
so
she
ran
on
directly
,
as
fast
as
she
could
,
and
took
shelter
at
Ford
's
.
"
 
<EOS>
Ford
's
was
the
principal
woollen
-
draper
,
linen
-
draper
,
and
haberdasher
's
shop
united
;
the
shop
first
in
size
and
fashion
in
the
place
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
so
,
there
she
had
set
,
without
an
idea
of
any
thing
in
the
world
,
full
ten
minutes
,
<EOS>
perhaps
 
when
,
all
of
a
sudden
,
who
should
come
in
 
to
be
sure
it
was
so
very
odd
!
 
<EOS>
but
they
always
dealt
at
Ford
's
 
who
should
come
in
,
but
Elizabeth
Martin
and
her
brother
!
 
<EOS>
Dear
Miss
Woodhouse
!
<EOS>
only
think
.
<EOS>
I
thought
I
should
have
fainted
.
<EOS>
I
did
not
know
what
to
do
.
<EOS>
I
was
sitting
near
the
door
 
<EOS>
Elizabeth
saw
me
directly
;
but
he
did
not
;
he
was
busy
with
the
umbrella
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
she
saw
me
,
but
she
looked
away
directly
,
and
took
no
notice
;
and
they
both
went
to
quite
the
farther
end
of
the
shop
;
and
I
kept
sitting
near
the
door
!
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
dear
;
I
was
so
miserable
!
<EOS>
I
am
sure
I
must
have
been
as
white
as
my
gown
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
go
away
you
know
,
because
of
the
rain
;
but
I
did
so
wish
myself
anywhere
in
the
world
<EOS>
but
there
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
dear
,
Miss
Woodhouse
 
<EOS>
well
,
at
last
,
I
fancy
,
he
looked
round
and
saw
me
;
for
instead
of
going
on
with
her
buyings
,
they
began
whispering
to
one
another
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
they
were
talking
of
me
;
and
I
could
not
help
thinking
that
he
was
persuading
her
to
speak
to
me
 
<EOS>
(
do
you
think
he
was
,
Miss
Woodhouse
?
)
 
<EOS>
for
presently
she
came
forward
 
<EOS>
came
quite
up
to
me
,
and
asked
me
how
I
did
,
and
seemed
ready
to
shake
hands
,
if
I
would
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
do
any
of
it
in
the
same
way
that
she
used
;
I
could
see
she
was
altered
;
but
<EOS>
,
however
,
she
seemed
to
_
try
_
to
be
very
friendly
,
and
we
shook
hands
,
and
stood
talking
some
time
;
but
I
know
no
more
what
I
said
 
<EOS>
I
was
in
such
a
tremble
!
 
<EOS>
I
remember
she
said
she
was
sorry
we
never
met
now
;
<EOS>
which
I
thought
almost
too
kind
!
<EOS>
Dear
,
Miss
Woodhouse
,
I
was
absolutely
miserable
!
<EOS>
By
that
time
,
it
was
beginning
to
hold
up
,
and
I
was
determined
that
nothing
should
stop
me
from
getting
away
 
and
then
 
only
think
!
 
<EOS>
I
found
he
was
coming
up
towards
me
too
 
slowly
you
know
,
and
as
if
he
did
not
quite
know
what
to
do
;
and
so
he
came
and
spoke
,
and
<EOS>
I
answered
 
and
I
stood
for
a
minute
,
feeling
dreadfully
,
you
know
,
one
ca
n't
tell
how
;
and
then
I
took
courage
,
and
said
it
did
not
rain
,
and
I
must
go
;
and
so
off
I
set
;
and
I
had
not
got
three
yards
from
the
door
,
when
he
came
after
me
,
only
to
say
<EOS>
,
if
I
was
going
to
Hartfield
,
he
thought
I
had
much
better
go
round
by
Mr.
Cole
's
stables
,
for
I
should
find
the
near
way
quite
floated
by
this
rain
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
dear
,
I
thought
it
would
have
been
the
death
of
me
!
<EOS>
So
I
said
,
I
was
very
much
obliged
to
him
:
<EOS>
you
know
I
could
not
do
less
;
and
then
he
went
back
to
Elizabeth
,
and
I
came
round
by
the
stables
 
<EOS>
I
believe
I
did
 
<EOS>
but
I
hardly
knew
where
I
was
,
or
any
thing
about
it
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
Miss
Woodhouse
,
I
would
rather
done
any
thing
than
have
it
happen
:
and
yet
,
you
know
,
there
was
a
sort
of
satisfaction
in
seeing
him
behave
so
pleasantly
<EOS>
and
so
kindly
.
<EOS>
And
Elizabeth
,
too
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
Miss
Woodhouse
,
do
talk
to
me
and
make
me
comfortable
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Very
sincerely
did
Emma
wish
to
do
so
;
but
it
was
not
immediately
in
her
power
.
<EOS>
She
was
obliged
to
stop
and
think
.
<EOS>
She
was
not
thoroughly
comfortable
herself
.
<EOS>
The
young
man
's
conduct
,
and
his
sister
's
,
seemed
the
result
of
real
feeling
,
and
she
could
not
but
pity
them
.
<EOS>
As
Harriet
described
it
,
there
had
been
an
interesting
mixture
of
wounded
affection
and
genuine
delicacy
in
their
behaviour
.
<EOS>
But
she
had
believed
them
to
be
well
-
meaning
,
worthy
people
before
;
and
what
difference
did
this
make
in
the
evils
of
the
connexion
?
<EOS>
It
was
folly
to
be
disturbed
by
it
.
<EOS>
Of
course
,
he
must
be
sorry
to
lose
her
 
<EOS>
they
must
be
all
sorry
.
<EOS>
Ambition
,
as
well
as
love
,
had
probably
been
mortified
.
<EOS>
They
might
all
have
hoped
to
rise
by
Harriet
's
acquaintance
:
and
besides
,
what
was
the
value
of
Harriet
's
description
?
 
<EOS>
So
easily
pleased
 
so
little
discerning
;
 
what
signified
her
praise
?
  
<EOS>
She
exerted
herself
,
and
did
try
to
make
her
comfortable
,
by
considering
all
that
had
passed
as
a
mere
trifle
,
and
quite
unworthy
of
being
dwelt
on
,
  
"
It
might
be
distressing
,
for
the
moment
,
"
said
she
;
"
but
you
seem
to
have
behaved
extremely
well
;
and
it
is
over
 
and
may
never
 
can
never
,
as
a
first
meeting
,
occur
again
,
and
therefore
you
need
not
think
about
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Harriet
said
,
"
very
true
,
"
and
she
"
would
not
think
about
it
;
"
but
still
she
talked
of
it
 
still
she
could
talk
of
nothing
else
;
and
Emma
,
at
last
,
in
order
to
put
the
Martins
out
of
her
head
,
was
obliged
to
hurry
on
the
news
,
which
she
had
meant
to
give
with
so
much
tender
caution
;
hardly
knowing
herself
whether
to
rejoice
or
be
angry
,
ashamed
or
only
amused
,
at
such
a
state
of
mind
in
poor
Harriet
 
<EOS>
such
a
conclusion
of
Mr.
Elton
's
importance
with
her
!
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Elton
's
rights
,
however
,
gradually
revived
.
<EOS>
Though
she
did
not
feel
the
first
intelligence
as
she
might
have
done
the
day
before
,
or
an
hour
before
,
its
interest
soon
increased
;
and
before
their
first
conversation
was
over
,
she
had
talked
herself
into
all
the
sensations
of
curiosity
,
wonder
and
regret
,
pain
and
pleasure
,
as
to
this
fortunate
Miss
Hawkins
,
which
could
conduce
to
place
the
Martins
under
proper
subordination
in
her
fancy
.
  
<EOS>
Emma
learned
to
be
rather
glad
that
there
had
been
such
a
meeting
.
<EOS>
It
had
been
serviceable
in
deadening
the
first
shock
,
without
retaining
any
influence
to
alarm
.
<EOS>
As
Harriet
now
lived
,
the
Martins
could
not
get
at
her
,
without
seeking
her
,
where
hitherto
they
had
wanted
either
the
courage
or
the
condescension
to
seek
her
;
for
since
her
refusal
of
the
brother
,
the
sisters
never
had
been
at
Mrs.
Goddard
's
;
and
a
twelvemonth
might
pass
without
their
being
thrown
together
again
,
with
any
necessity
,
or
even
any
power
of
speech
.
    
<EOS>
Human
nature
is
so
well
disposed
towards
those
who
are
in
interesting
situations
,
that
a
young
person
,
who
either
marries
or
dies
,
is
sure
of
being
kindly
spoken
of
.
  
<EOS>
A
week
had
not
passed
since
Miss
Hawkins
's
name
was
first
mentioned
in
Highbury
,
before
she
was
,
by
some
means
or
other
,
discovered
to
have
every
recommendation
of
person
and
mind
;
to
be
handsome
,
elegant
,
highly
accomplished
,
and
perfectly
amiable
:
and
when
Mr.
Elton
himself
arrived
to
triumph
in
his
happy
prospects
,
and
circulate
the
fame
of
her
merits
,
there
was
very
little
more
for
him
to
do
,
than
to
tell
her
Christian
name
,
and
say
whose
music
she
principally
played
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Elton
returned
,
a
very
happy
man
.
<EOS>
He
had
gone
away
rejected
and
mortified
 
disappointed
in
a
very
sanguine
hope
,
after
a
series
of
what
appeared
to
him
strong
encouragement
;
and
not
only
losing
the
right
lady
,
but
finding
himself
debased
to
the
level
of
a
very
wrong
one
.
<EOS>
He
had
gone
away
deeply
offended
 
<EOS>
he
came
back
engaged
to
another
 
and
to
another
as
superior
,
of
course
,
to
the
first
,
as
under
such
circumstances
what
is
gained
always
is
to
what
is
lost
.
<EOS>
He
came
back
gay
and
self
-
satisfied
,
eager
and
busy
,
caring
nothing
for
Miss
Woodhouse
,
and
defying
Miss
Smith
.
  
<EOS>
The
charming
Augusta
Hawkins
,
in
addition
to
all
the
usual
advantages
of
perfect
beauty
and
merit
,
was
in
possession
of
an
independent
fortune
,
of
so
many
thousands
as
would
always
be
called
ten
;
a
point
of
some
dignity
,
as
well
as
some
convenience
:
the
story
told
well
;
he
had
not
thrown
himself
away
 
<EOS>
he
had
gained
a
woman
of
10,000
l.
or
thereabouts
;
and
he
had
gained
her
with
such
delightful
rapidity
 
the
first
hour
of
introduction
had
been
so
very
soon
followed
by
distinguishing
notice
;
the
history
which
he
had
to
give
Mrs.
Cole
of
the
rise
and
progress
of
the
affair
was
so
glorious
 
<EOS>
the
steps
so
quick
,
from
the
accidental
rencontre
,
to
the
dinner
at
Mr.
Green
's
,
and
the
party
at
Mrs.
Brown
's
 
smiles
and
blushes
rising
in
importance
 
with
consciousness
and
agitation
richly
scattered
 
<EOS>
the
lady
had
been
so
easily
impressed
 
<EOS>
so
sweetly
disposed
 
<EOS>
had
in
short
,
to
use
a
most
intelligible
phrase
,
been
so
very
ready
to
have
him
,
<EOS>
that
vanity
and
prudence
were
equally
contented
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
caught
both
substance
and
shadow
 
both
fortune
and
affection
,
and
was
just
the
happy
man
he
ought
to
be
;
talking
only
of
himself
and
his
own
concerns
 
expecting
to
be
congratulated
 
ready
to
be
laughed
at
 
and
,
with
cordial
,
fearless
smiles
,
now
addressing
all
the
young
ladies
of
the
place
,
to
whom
,
a
few
weeks
ago
,
he
would
have
been
more
cautiously
gallant
.
  
<EOS>
The
wedding
was
no
distant
event
,
as
the
parties
had
only
themselves
to
please
,
and
nothing
but
the
necessary
preparations
to
wait
for
;
and
when
he
set
out
for
Bath
again
,
there
was
a
general
expectation
,
which
a
certain
glance
of
Mrs.
Cole
's
did
not
seem
to
contradict
,
that
when
he
next
entered
Highbury
he
would
bring
his
bride
.
  
<EOS>
During
his
present
short
stay
,
Emma
had
barely
seen
him
;
but
just
enough
to
feel
that
the
first
meeting
was
over
,
and
to
give
her
the
impression
of
his
not
being
improved
by
the
mixture
of
pique
and
pretension
,
now
spread
over
his
air
.
<EOS>
She
was
,
in
fact
,
beginning
very
much
to
wonder
that
she
had
ever
thought
him
pleasing
at
all
;
and
his
sight
was
so
inseparably
connected
with
some
very
disagreeable
feelings
,
that
,
except
in
a
moral
light
,
as
a
penance
,
a
lesson
,
a
source
of
profitable
humiliation
to
her
own
mind
,
she
would
have
been
thankful
to
be
assured
of
never
seeing
him
again
.
<EOS>
She
wished
him
very
well
;
but
he
gave
her
pain
,
and
his
welfare
twenty
miles
off
would
administer
most
satisfaction
.
  
<EOS>
The
pain
of
his
continued
residence
in
Highbury
,
however
,
must
certainly
be
lessened
by
his
marriage
.
<EOS>
Many
vain
solicitudes
would
be
prevented
 
many
awkwardnesses
smoothed
by
it
.
<EOS>
A
_
Mrs.
_
_
Elton
_
would
be
an
excuse
for
any
change
of
intercourse
;
former
intimacy
might
sink
without
remark
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
almost
beginning
their
life
of
civility
again
.
  
<EOS>
Of
the
lady
,
individually
,
Emma
thought
very
little
.
<EOS>
She
was
good
enough
for
Mr.
Elton
,
no
doubt
;
accomplished
enough
for
Highbury
 
<EOS>
handsome
enough
 
to
look
plain
,
probably
,
by
Harriet
's
side
.
<EOS>
As
to
connexion
,
there
Emma
was
perfectly
easy
;
persuaded
,
that
after
all
his
own
vaunted
claims
and
disdain
of
Harriet
,
he
had
done
nothing
.
<EOS>
On
that
article
,
truth
seemed
attainable
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
What
_
<EOS>
she
was
,
must
be
uncertain
;
but
_
who
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
she
was
,
might
be
found
out
;
and
setting
aside
the
10,000
l.
,
it
did
not
appear
that
she
was
at
all
Harriet
's
superior
.
<EOS>
She
brought
no
name
,
no
blood
,
no
alliance
.
<EOS>
Miss
Hawkins
was
the
youngest
of
the
two
daughters
of
a
Bristol
 
merchant
,
of
course
,
he
must
be
called
;
but
,
as
the
whole
of
the
profits
of
his
mercantile
life
appeared
so
very
moderate
,
it
was
not
unfair
to
guess
the
dignity
of
his
line
of
trade
had
been
very
moderate
also
.
<EOS>
Part
of
every
winter
she
had
been
used
to
spend
in
Bath
;
but
Bristol
was
her
home
,
the
very
heart
of
Bristol
;
for
though
the
father
and
mother
had
died
some
years
ago
,
an
uncle
remained
 
in
the
law
line
 
nothing
more
distinctly
honourable
was
hazarded
of
him
,
than
that
he
was
in
the
law
line
;
and
with
him
the
daughter
had
lived
.
<EOS>
Emma
guessed
him
to
be
the
drudge
of
some
attorney
,
and
too
stupid
to
rise
.
<EOS>
And
all
the
grandeur
of
the
connexion
seemed
dependent
on
the
elder
sister
,
who
was
_
<EOS>
very
_
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
well
_
_
married
_
,
to
a
gentleman
in
a
_
great
_
_
way
<EOS>
_
,
near
Bristol
,
who
kept
two
carriages
!
<EOS>
That
was
the
wind
-
up
of
the
history
;
that
was
the
glory
of
Miss
Hawkins
.
  
<EOS>
Could
she
but
have
given
Harriet
her
feelings
about
it
all
!
<EOS>
She
had
talked
her
into
love
;
but
,
alas
!
<EOS>
she
was
not
so
easily
to
be
talked
out
of
it
.
<EOS>
The
charm
of
an
object
to
occupy
the
many
vacancies
of
Harriet
's
mind
was
not
to
be
talked
away
.
<EOS>
He
might
be
superseded
by
another
;
he
certainly
would
indeed
;
nothing
could
be
clearer
;
even
a
Robert
Martin
would
have
been
sufficient
;
but
nothing
else
,
she
feared
,
would
cure
her
.
<EOS>
Harriet
was
one
of
those
,
who
,
having
once
begun
,
would
be
always
in
love
.
<EOS>
And
now
,
poor
girl
!
<EOS>
she
was
considerably
worse
from
this
reappearance
of
Mr.
Elton
.
<EOS>
She
was
always
having
a
glimpse
of
him
somewhere
or
other
.
<EOS>
Emma
saw
him
only
once
;
but
two
or
three
times
every
day
Harriet
was
sure
<EOS>
_
just
_
<EOS>
to
meet
with
him
,
or
_
just
_
to
miss
him
,
_
just
_
to
hear
his
voice
,
or
see
his
shoulder
,
_
just
_
to
have
something
occur
to
preserve
him
in
her
fancy
,
in
all
the
favouring
warmth
of
surprize
and
conjecture
.
<EOS>
She
was
,
moreover
,
perpetually
hearing
about
him
;
for
,
excepting
when
at
Hartfield
,
she
was
always
among
those
who
saw
no
fault
in
Mr.
Elton
,
and
found
nothing
so
interesting
as
the
discussion
of
his
concerns
;
and
every
report
,
therefore
,
every
guess
 
<EOS>
all
that
had
already
occurred
,
all
that
might
occur
in
the
arrangement
of
his
affairs
,
comprehending
income
,
servants
,
and
furniture
,
was
continually
in
agitation
around
her
.
<EOS>
Her
regard
was
receiving
strength
by
invariable
praise
of
him
,
and
her
regrets
kept
alive
,
and
feelings
irritated
by
ceaseless
repetitions
of
Miss
Hawkins
's
happiness
,
and
continual
observation
of
,
how
much
he
seemed
attached
!
 
<EOS>
his
air
as
he
walked
by
the
house
 
<EOS>
the
very
sitting
of
his
hat
,
being
all
in
proof
of
how
much
he
was
in
love
!
  
<EOS>
Had
it
been
allowable
entertainment
,
<EOS>
had
there
been
no
pain
to
her
friend
,
or
reproach
to
herself
,
in
the
waverings
of
Harriet
's
mind
,
Emma
would
have
been
amused
by
its
variations
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
Mr.
Elton
predominated
,
sometimes
the
Martins
;
and
each
was
occasionally
useful
as
a
check
to
the
other
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Elton
's
engagement
had
been
the
cure
of
the
agitation
of
meeting
Mr.
Martin
.
<EOS>
The
unhappiness
produced
by
the
knowledge
of
that
engagement
had
been
a
little
put
aside
by
Elizabeth
Martin
's
calling
at
Mrs.
Goddard
's
a
few
days
afterwards
.
<EOS>
Harriet
had
not
been
at
home
;
but
a
note
had
been
prepared
and
left
for
her
,
written
in
the
very
style
to
touch
;
a
small
mixture
of
reproach
,
with
a
great
deal
of
kindness
;
and
till
Mr.
Elton
himself
appeared
,
she
had
been
much
occupied
by
it
,
continually
pondering
over
what
could
be
done
in
return
,
and
wishing
to
do
more
than
she
dared
to
confess
.
<EOS>
But
Mr.
Elton
,
in
person
,
had
driven
away
all
such
cares
.
<EOS>
While
he
staid
,
the
Martins
were
forgotten
;
and
on
the
very
morning
of
his
setting
off
for
Bath
again
,
Emma
,
to
dissipate
some
of
the
distress
it
occasioned
,
judged
it
best
for
her
to
return
Elizabeth
Martin
's
visit
.
  
<EOS>
How
that
visit
was
to
be
acknowledged
 
what
would
be
necessary
 
and
what
might
be
safest
,
had
been
a
point
of
some
doubtful
consideration
.
<EOS>
Absolute
neglect
of
the
mother
and
sisters
,
when
invited
to
come
,
would
be
ingratitude
.
<EOS>
It
must
not
be
:
and
yet
the
danger
of
a
renewal
of
the
acquaintance
 
!
  
<EOS>
After
much
thinking
,
she
could
determine
on
nothing
better
,
than
Harriet
's
returning
the
visit
;
but
in
a
way
that
,
if
they
had
understanding
,
should
convince
them
that
it
was
to
be
only
a
formal
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
She
meant
to
take
her
in
the
carriage
,
leave
her
at
the
Abbey
Mill
,
while
she
drove
a
little
farther
,
and
call
for
her
again
so
soon
,
as
to
allow
no
time
for
insidious
applications
or
dangerous
recurrences
to
the
past
,
and
give
the
most
decided
proof
of
what
degree
of
intimacy
was
chosen
for
the
future
.
  
<EOS>
She
could
think
of
nothing
better
:
and
though
there
was
something
in
it
which
her
own
heart
could
not
approve
 
something
of
ingratitude
,
merely
glossed
over
 
it
must
be
done
,
or
what
would
become
of
Harriet
?
    
<EOS>
Small
heart
had
Harriet
for
visiting
.
<EOS>
Only
half
an
hour
before
her
friend
called
for
her
at
Mrs.
Goddard
's
,
her
evil
stars
had
led
her
to
the
very
spot
where
,
at
that
moment
,
a
trunk
,
directed
to
_
The
Rev.
Philip
Elton
,
White
-
Hart
,
Bath
_
,
was
to
be
seen
under
the
operation
of
being
lifted
into
the
butcher
's
cart
,
which
was
to
convey
it
to
where
the
coaches
past
;
and
every
thing
in
this
world
,
excepting
that
trunk
and
the
direction
,
was
consequently
a
blank
.
  
<EOS>
She
went
,
however
;
and
when
they
reached
the
farm
,
and
she
was
to
be
put
down
,
at
the
end
of
the
broad
,
neat
gravel
walk
,
which
led
between
espalier
apple
-
trees
to
the
front
door
,
the
sight
of
every
thing
which
had
given
her
so
much
pleasure
the
autumn
before
,
was
beginning
to
revive
a
little
local
agitation
;
and
when
they
parted
,
Emma
observed
her
to
be
looking
around
with
a
sort
of
fearful
curiosity
,
which
determined
her
not
to
allow
the
visit
to
exceed
the
proposed
quarter
of
an
hour
.
<EOS>
She
went
on
herself
,
to
give
that
portion
of
time
to
an
old
servant
who
was
married
,
and
settled
in
Donwell
.
  
<EOS>
The
quarter
of
an
hour
brought
her
punctually
to
the
white
gate
again
;
and
Miss
Smith
receiving
her
summons
,
was
with
her
without
delay
,
and
unattended
by
any
alarming
young
man
.
<EOS>
She
came
solitarily
down
the
gravel
walk
 
<EOS>
a
Miss
Martin
just
appearing
at
the
door
,
and
parting
with
her
seemingly
with
ceremonious
civility
.
  
<EOS>
Harriet
could
not
very
soon
give
an
intelligible
account
.
<EOS>
She
was
feeling
too
much
;
but
at
last
Emma
collected
from
her
enough
to
understand
the
sort
of
meeting
,
and
the
sort
of
pain
it
was
creating
.
<EOS>
She
had
seen
only
Mrs.
Martin
and
the
two
girls
.
<EOS>
They
had
received
her
doubtingly
,
if
not
coolly
;
and
nothing
beyond
the
merest
commonplace
had
been
talked
almost
all
the
time
 
till
just
at
last
,
when
Mrs.
Martin
's
saying
,
all
of
a
sudden
,
that
she
thought
Miss
Smith
was
grown
,
had
brought
on
a
more
interesting
subject
,
and
a
warmer
manner
.
<EOS>
In
that
very
room
she
had
been
measured
last
September
,
with
her
two
friends
.
<EOS>
There
were
the
pencilled
marks
and
memorandums
on
the
wainscot
by
the
window
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
He
_
had
done
it
.
<EOS>
They
all
seemed
to
remember
the
day
,
the
hour
,
the
party
,
the
occasion
 
to
feel
the
same
consciousness
,
the
same
regrets
 
to
be
ready
to
return
to
the
same
good
understanding
;
and
they
were
just
growing
again
like
themselves
,
(
Harriet
,
as
Emma
must
suspect
,
as
ready
as
the
best
of
them
to
be
cordial
and
happy
,
)
when
the
carriage
reappeared
,
and
all
was
over
.
<EOS>
The
style
of
the
visit
,
and
the
shortness
of
it
,
were
then
felt
to
be
decisive
.
<EOS>
Fourteen
minutes
to
be
given
to
those
with
whom
she
had
thankfully
passed
six
weeks
not
six
months
ago
!
 
<EOS>
Emma
could
not
but
picture
it
all
,
and
feel
how
justly
they
might
resent
,
how
naturally
Harriet
must
suffer
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
bad
business
.
<EOS>
She
would
have
given
a
great
deal
,
or
endured
a
great
deal
,
to
have
had
the
Martins
in
a
higher
rank
of
life
.
<EOS>
They
were
so
deserving
,
that
a
_
little
_
higher
should
have
been
enough
:
but
as
it
was
,
how
could
she
have
done
otherwise
?
 
<EOS>
Impossible
!
 
<EOS>
She
could
not
repent
.
<EOS>
They
must
be
separated
;
but
there
was
a
great
deal
of
pain
in
the
process
 
so
much
to
herself
at
this
time
,
that
she
soon
felt
the
necessity
of
a
little
consolation
,
and
resolved
on
going
home
by
way
of
Randalls
to
procure
it
.
<EOS>
Her
mind
was
quite
sick
of
Mr.
Elton
and
the
Martins
.
<EOS>
The
refreshment
of
Randalls
was
absolutely
necessary
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
good
scheme
;
but
on
driving
to
the
door
they
heard
that
neither
"
master
nor
mistress
was
at
home
;
"
they
had
both
been
out
some
time
;
the
man
believed
they
were
gone
to
Hartfield
.
  
<EOS>
"
This
is
too
bad
,
"
cried
Emma
,
as
they
turned
away
.
"
<EOS>
And
now
we
shall
just
miss
them
;
too
provoking
!
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
when
I
have
been
so
disappointed
.
"
<EOS>
And
she
leaned
back
in
the
corner
,
to
indulge
her
murmurs
,
or
to
reason
them
away
;
<EOS>
probably
a
little
of
both
 
such
being
the
commonest
process
of
a
not
ill
-
disposed
mind
.
<EOS>
Presently
the
carriage
stopt
;
she
looked
up
;
it
was
stopt
by
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Weston
,
who
were
standing
to
speak
to
her
.
<EOS>
There
was
instant
pleasure
in
the
sight
of
them
,
and
still
greater
pleasure
was
conveyed
in
sound
 
for
Mr.
Weston
immediately
accosted
her
with
,
  
<EOS>
"
How
d'ye
do
?
 
<EOS>
how
d'ye
do
?
 
<EOS>
We
have
been
sitting
with
your
father
 
glad
to
see
him
so
well
.
<EOS>
Frank
comes
to
-
morrow
 
<EOS>
I
had
a
letter
this
morning
 
<EOS>
we
see
him
to
-
morrow
by
dinner
-
time
to
a
certainty
 
<EOS>
he
is
at
Oxford
to
-
day
,
and
he
comes
for
a
whole
fortnight
;
I
knew
it
would
be
so
.
<EOS>
If
he
had
come
at
Christmas
he
could
not
have
staid
three
days
;
I
was
always
glad
he
did
not
come
at
Christmas
;
now
we
are
going
to
have
just
the
right
weather
for
him
,
fine
,
dry
,
settled
weather
.
<EOS>
We
shall
enjoy
him
completely
;
every
thing
has
turned
out
exactly
as
we
could
wish
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
no
resisting
such
news
,
no
possibility
of
avoiding
the
influence
of
such
a
happy
face
as
Mr.
Weston
's
,
confirmed
as
it
all
was
by
the
words
and
the
countenance
of
his
wife
,
fewer
and
quieter
,
but
not
less
to
the
purpose
.
<EOS>
To
know
that
_
she
_
thought
his
coming
certain
was
enough
to
make
Emma
consider
it
so
,
and
sincerely
did
she
rejoice
in
their
joy
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
most
delightful
reanimation
of
exhausted
spirits
.
<EOS>
The
worn
-
out
past
was
sunk
in
the
freshness
of
what
was
coming
;
and
in
the
rapidity
of
half
a
moment
's
thought
,
she
hoped
Mr.
Elton
would
now
be
talked
of
no
more
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Weston
gave
her
the
history
of
the
engagements
at
Enscombe
,
which
allowed
his
son
to
answer
for
having
an
entire
fortnight
at
his
command
,
as
well
as
the
route
and
the
method
of
his
journey
;
and
she
listened
,
and
smiled
,
and
congratulated
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
soon
bring
him
over
to
Hartfield
,
"
said
he
,
at
the
conclusion
.
  
<EOS>
Emma
could
imagine
she
saw
a
touch
of
the
arm
at
this
speech
,
from
his
wife
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
had
better
move
on
,
Mr.
Weston
,
"
said
she
,
"
we
are
detaining
the
girls
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
well
,
I
am
ready
;
"
 
and
turning
again
to
Emma
,
"
but
you
must
not
be
expecting
such
a
_
very
_
fine
young
man
;
you
have
only
had
_
<EOS>
my
_
account
<EOS>
you
know
;
I
dare
say
he
is
really
nothing
extraordinary
:
"
 
though
his
own
sparkling
eyes
at
the
moment
were
speaking
a
very
different
conviction
.
  
<EOS>
Emma
could
look
perfectly
unconscious
and
innocent
,
and
answer
in
a
manner
that
appropriated
nothing
.
  
<EOS>
"
Think
of
me
to
-
morrow
,
my
dear
Emma
,
about
four
o'clock
,
"
was
Mrs.
Weston
's
parting
injunction
;
spoken
with
some
anxiety
,
and
meant
only
for
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Four
o'clock
!
 
<EOS>
depend
upon
it
he
will
be
here
by
three
,
"
was
Mr.
Weston
's
quick
amendment
;
and
so
ended
a
most
satisfactory
meeting
.
<EOS>
Emma
's
spirits
were
mounted
quite
up
to
happiness
;
every
thing
wore
a
different
air
;
James
and
his
horses
seemed
not
half
so
sluggish
as
before
.
<EOS>
When
she
looked
at
the
hedges
,
she
thought
the
elder
at
least
must
soon
be
coming
out
;
and
when
she
turned
round
to
Harriet
,
she
saw
something
like
a
look
of
spring
,
a
tender
smile
even
there
.
  
<EOS>
"
Will
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
pass
through
Bath
as
well
as
Oxford
?
"
 
<EOS>
was
a
question
,
however
,
which
did
not
augur
much
.
  
<EOS>
But
neither
geography
nor
tranquillity
could
come
all
at
once
,
and
Emma
was
now
in
a
humour
to
resolve
that
they
should
both
come
in
time
.
  
<EOS>
The
morning
of
the
interesting
day
arrived
,
and
Mrs.
Weston
's
faithful
pupil
did
not
forget
either
at
ten
,
or
eleven
,
or
twelve
o'clock
,
that
she
was
to
think
of
her
at
four
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
dear
anxious
friend
,
"
 
said
she
,
in
mental
soliloquy
,
while
walking
downstairs
from
her
own
room
,
"
always
overcareful
for
every
body
's
comfort
but
your
own
;
I
see
you
now
in
all
your
little
fidgets
,
going
again
and
again
into
his
room
,
to
be
sure
that
all
is
right
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
clock
struck
twelve
as
she
passed
through
the
hall
.
"
<EOS>
'
tis
twelve
<EOS>
;
I
shall
not
forget
to
think
of
you
four
hours
hence
;
and
by
this
time
to
-
morrow
,
perhaps
,
or
a
little
later
,
I
may
be
thinking
of
the
possibility
of
their
all
calling
here
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
they
will
bring
him
soon
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
opened
the
parlour
door
,
and
saw
two
gentlemen
sitting
with
her
father
 
Mr.
Weston
and
his
son
.
<EOS>
They
had
been
arrived
only
a
few
minutes
,
and
Mr.
Weston
had
scarcely
finished
his
explanation
of
Frank
's
being
a
day
before
his
time
,
and
her
father
was
yet
in
the
midst
of
his
very
civil
welcome
and
congratulations
,
when
she
appeared
,
to
have
her
share
of
surprize
,
introduction
,
and
pleasure
.
  
<EOS>
The
Frank
Churchill
so
long
talked
of
,
so
high
in
interest
,
was
actually
before
her
 
he
was
presented
to
her
,
and
she
did
not
think
too
much
had
been
said
in
his
praise
;
he
was
a
_
very
_
good
looking
young
man
;
height
,
air
,
address
,
all
were
unexceptionable
,
and
his
countenance
had
a
great
deal
of
the
spirit
and
liveliness
of
his
father
's
;
he
looked
quick
and
sensible
.
<EOS>
She
felt
immediately
that
she
should
like
him
;
and
there
was
a
well
-
bred
ease
of
manner
,
and
a
readiness
to
talk
,
which
convinced
her
that
he
came
intending
to
be
acquainted
with
her
,
and
that
acquainted
they
soon
must
be
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
reached
Randalls
the
evening
before
.
<EOS>
She
was
pleased
with
the
eagerness
to
arrive
which
had
made
him
alter
his
plan
,
and
travel
earlier
,
later
,
and
quicker
,
that
he
might
gain
half
a
day
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
told
you
yesterday
,
"
cried
Mr.
Weston
with
exultation
,
"
I
told
you
all
that
he
would
be
here
before
the
time
named
.
<EOS>
I
remembered
what
I
used
to
do
myself
.
<EOS>
One
can
not
creep
upon
a
journey
;
one
can
not
help
getting
on
faster
than
one
has
planned
;
and
the
pleasure
of
coming
in
upon
one
's
friends
before
the
look
-
out
begins
,
is
worth
a
great
deal
more
than
any
little
exertion
it
needs
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
great
pleasure
where
one
can
indulge
in
it
,
"
said
the
young
man
,
"
though
there
are
not
many
houses
that
I
should
presume
on
so
far
;
but
in
coming
_
home
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
I
felt
I
might
do
any
thing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
word
_
home
_
made
his
father
look
on
him
with
fresh
complacency
.
<EOS>
Emma
was
directly
sure
that
he
knew
how
to
make
himself
agreeable
;
the
conviction
was
strengthened
by
what
followed
.
<EOS>
He
was
very
much
pleased
with
Randalls
,
thought
it
a
most
admirably
arranged
house
,
would
hardly
allow
it
even
to
be
very
small
,
admired
the
situation
,
the
walk
to
Highbury
,
Highbury
itself
,
Hartfield
still
more
,
and
professed
himself
to
have
always
felt
the
sort
of
interest
in
the
country
which
none
but
one
's
_
own
_
country
gives
,
and
the
greatest
curiosity
to
visit
it
.
<EOS>
That
he
should
never
have
been
able
to
indulge
so
amiable
a
feeling
before
,
passed
suspiciously
through
Emma
's
brain
;
but
still
,
if
it
were
a
falsehood
,
it
was
a
pleasant
one
,
and
pleasantly
handled
.
<EOS>
His
manner
had
no
air
of
study
or
exaggeration
.
<EOS>
He
did
really
look
and
speak
as
if
in
a
state
of
no
common
enjoyment
.
  
<EOS>
Their
subjects
in
general
were
such
as
belong
to
an
opening
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
On
his
side
were
the
inquiries
,
 
"
Was
she
a
horsewoman
?
 
<EOS>
Pleasant
rides
?
 
<EOS>
Pleasant
walks
?
 
<EOS>
Had
they
a
large
neighbourhood
?
 
<EOS>
Highbury
,
perhaps
,
afforded
society
enough
?
 
<EOS>
There
were
several
very
pretty
houses
in
and
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
Balls
 
had
they
balls
?
 
<EOS>
Was
it
a
musical
society
?
"
  
<EOS>
But
when
satisfied
on
all
these
points
,
and
their
acquaintance
proportionably
advanced
,
he
contrived
to
find
an
opportunity
,
while
their
two
fathers
were
engaged
with
each
other
,
of
introducing
his
mother
-
in
-
law
,
and
speaking
of
her
with
so
much
handsome
praise
,
so
much
warm
admiration
,
so
much
gratitude
for
the
happiness
she
secured
to
his
father
,
and
her
very
kind
reception
of
himself
,
as
was
an
additional
proof
of
his
knowing
how
to
please
 
and
of
his
certainly
thinking
it
worth
while
to
try
to
please
her
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
advance
a
word
of
praise
beyond
what
she
knew
to
be
thoroughly
deserved
by
Mrs.
Weston
;
but
,
undoubtedly
he
could
know
very
little
of
the
matter
.
<EOS>
He
understood
what
would
be
welcome
;
he
could
be
sure
of
little
else
.
"
<EOS>
His
father
's
marriage
,
"
he
said
,
"
had
been
the
wisest
measure
,
every
friend
must
rejoice
in
it
;
and
the
family
from
whom
he
had
received
such
a
blessing
must
be
ever
considered
as
having
conferred
the
highest
obligation
on
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
got
as
near
as
he
could
to
thanking
her
for
Miss
Taylor
's
merits
,
without
seeming
quite
to
forget
that
in
the
common
course
of
things
it
was
to
be
rather
supposed
that
Miss
Taylor
had
formed
Miss
Woodhouse
's
character
,
than
Miss
Woodhouse
Miss
Taylor
's
.
<EOS>
And
at
last
,
as
if
resolved
to
qualify
his
opinion
completely
for
travelling
round
to
its
object
,
he
wound
it
all
up
with
astonishment
at
the
youth
and
beauty
of
her
person
.
  
<EOS>
"
Elegant
,
agreeable
manners
,
I
was
prepared
for
,
"
said
he
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
confess
that
,
considering
every
thing
,
I
had
not
expected
more
than
a
very
tolerably
well
-
looking
woman
of
a
certain
age
;
I
did
not
know
that
I
was
to
find
a
pretty
young
woman
in
Mrs.
Weston
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
You
can
not
see
too
much
perfection
in
Mrs.
Weston
for
my
feelings
,
"
said
Emma
;
"
were
you
to
guess
her
to
be
_
eighteen
<EOS>
_
,
I
should
listen
with
pleasure
;
but
_
she
_
would
be
ready
to
quarrel
with
you
for
using
such
words
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
let
her
imagine
that
you
have
spoken
of
her
as
a
pretty
young
woman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
I
should
know
better
,
"
he
replied
;
"
no
,
depend
upon
it
,
(
with
a
gallant
bow
,
)
<EOS>
that
in
addressing
Mrs.
Weston
<EOS>
I
should
understand
whom
I
might
praise
without
any
danger
of
being
thought
extravagant
in
my
terms
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
wondered
whether
the
same
suspicion
of
what
might
be
expected
from
their
knowing
each
other
,
which
had
taken
strong
possession
of
her
mind
,
had
ever
crossed
his
;
and
whether
his
compliments
were
to
be
considered
as
marks
of
acquiescence
,
or
proofs
of
defiance
.
<EOS>
She
must
see
more
of
him
to
understand
his
ways
;
at
present
she
only
felt
they
were
agreeable
.
  
<EOS>
She
had
no
doubt
of
what
Mr.
Weston
was
often
thinking
about
.
<EOS>
His
quick
eye
she
detected
again
and
again
glancing
towards
them
with
a
happy
expression
;
and
even
,
when
he
might
have
determined
not
to
look
,
she
was
confident
that
he
was
often
listening
.
  
<EOS>
Her
own
father
's
perfect
exemption
from
any
thought
of
the
kind
,
the
entire
deficiency
in
him
of
all
such
sort
of
penetration
or
suspicion
,
was
a
most
comfortable
circumstance
.
<EOS>
Happily
he
was
not
farther
from
approving
matrimony
than
from
foreseeing
it
.
 
<EOS>
Though
always
objecting
to
every
marriage
that
was
arranged
,
he
never
suffered
beforehand
from
the
apprehension
of
any
;
it
seemed
as
if
he
could
not
think
so
ill
of
any
two
persons
'
understanding
as
to
suppose
they
meant
to
marry
till
it
were
proved
against
them
.
<EOS>
She
blessed
the
favouring
blindness
.
<EOS>
He
could
now
,
without
the
drawback
of
a
single
unpleasant
surmise
,
without
a
glance
forward
at
any
possible
treachery
in
his
guest
,
give
way
to
all
his
natural
kind
-
hearted
civility
in
solicitous
inquiries
after
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
's
accommodation
on
his
journey
,
through
the
sad
evils
of
sleeping
two
nights
on
the
road
,
and
express
very
genuine
unmixed
anxiety
to
know
that
he
had
certainly
escaped
catching
cold
 
<EOS>
which
,
however
,
he
could
not
allow
him
to
feel
quite
assured
of
himself
till
after
another
night
.
  
<EOS>
A
reasonable
visit
paid
,
Mr.
Weston
began
to
move
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
must
be
going
.
<EOS>
He
had
business
at
the
Crown
about
his
hay
,
and
a
great
many
errands
for
Mrs.
Weston
at
Ford
's
,
but
he
need
not
hurry
any
body
else
.
"
<EOS>
His
son
,
too
well
bred
to
hear
the
hint
,
rose
immediately
also
,
saying
,
  
"
As
you
are
going
farther
on
business
,
sir
,
I
will
take
the
opportunity
of
paying
a
visit
,
which
must
be
paid
some
day
or
other
,
and
therefore
may
as
well
be
paid
now
.
<EOS>
I
have
the
honour
of
being
acquainted
with
a
neighbour
of
yours
,
(
turning
to
Emma
,
)
a
lady
residing
in
or
near
Highbury
;
a
family
of
the
name
of
Fairfax
.
<EOS>
I
shall
have
no
difficulty
,
I
suppose
,
in
finding
the
house
;
though
Fairfax
,
I
believe
,
is
not
the
proper
name
 
<EOS>
I
should
rather
say
Barnes
,
or
Bates
.
<EOS>
Do
you
know
any
family
of
that
name
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
To
be
sure
we
do
,
"
cried
his
father
;
"
Mrs.
Bates
 
<EOS>
we
passed
her
house
 
<EOS>
I
saw
Miss
Bates
at
the
window
.
<EOS>
True
,
true
,
you
are
acquainted
with
Miss
Fairfax
;
I
remember
you
knew
her
at
Weymouth
,
and
a
fine
girl
she
is
.
<EOS>
Call
upon
her
,
by
all
means
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
no
necessity
for
my
calling
this
morning
,
"
said
the
young
man
;
"
another
day
would
do
as
well
;
but
there
was
that
degree
of
acquaintance
at
Weymouth
which
 
"
  
"
Oh
!
go
to
-
day
,
go
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
Do
not
defer
it
.
<EOS>
What
is
right
to
be
done
can
not
be
done
too
soon
.
<EOS>
And
,
besides
,
I
must
give
you
a
hint
,
Frank
;
any
want
of
attention
to
her
_
here
<EOS>
_
should
be
carefully
avoided
.
<EOS>
You
saw
her
with
the
Campbells
,
when
she
was
the
equal
of
every
body
she
mixed
with
,
but
here
she
is
with
a
poor
old
grandmother
,
who
has
barely
enough
to
live
on
.
<EOS>
If
you
do
not
call
early
it
will
be
a
slight
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
son
looked
convinced
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
heard
her
speak
of
the
acquaintance
,
"
said
Emma
;
"
she
is
a
very
elegant
young
woman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
agreed
to
it
,
but
with
so
quiet
<EOS>
a
"
Yes
,
"
as
inclined
her
almost
to
doubt
his
real
concurrence
;
and
yet
there
must
be
a
very
distinct
sort
of
elegance
for
the
fashionable
world
,
if
Jane
Fairfax
could
be
thought
only
ordinarily
gifted
with
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
were
never
particularly
struck
by
her
manners
before
,
"
said
she
,
"
I
think
you
will
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
You
will
see
her
to
advantage
;
see
her
and
hear
her
 
<EOS>
no
,
I
am
afraid
you
will
not
hear
her
at
all
,
for
she
has
an
aunt
who
never
holds
her
tongue
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
acquainted
with
Miss
Jane
Fairfax
,
sir
,
are
you
?
"
said
Mr.
Woodhouse
,
always
the
last
to
make
his
way
in
conversation
;
"
then
give
me
leave
to
assure
you
that
you
will
find
her
a
very
agreeable
young
lady
.
<EOS>
She
is
staying
here
on
a
visit
to
her
grandmama
and
aunt
,
very
worthy
people
;
I
have
known
them
all
my
life
.
<EOS>
They
will
be
extremely
glad
to
see
you
,
I
am
sure
;
and
one
of
my
servants
shall
go
with
you
to
shew
you
the
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
sir
,
upon
no
account
in
the
world
;
my
father
can
direct
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
your
father
is
not
going
so
far
;
he
is
only
going
to
the
Crown
,
quite
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
,
and
there
are
a
great
many
houses
;
you
might
be
very
much
at
a
loss
,
and
it
is
a
very
dirty
walk
,
unless
you
keep
on
the
footpath
;
but
my
coachman
can
tell
you
where
you
had
best
cross
the
street
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
still
declined
it
,
looking
as
serious
as
he
could
,
and
his
father
gave
his
hearty
support
by
calling
out
,
"
My
good
friend
,
this
is
quite
unnecessary
;
Frank
knows
a
puddle
of
water
when
he
sees
it
,
and
as
to
Mrs.
Bates
's
,
he
may
get
there
from
the
Crown
in
a
hop
,
step
,
and
jump
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
They
were
permitted
to
go
alone
;
and
with
a
cordial
nod
from
one
,
and
a
graceful
bow
from
the
other
,
the
two
gentlemen
took
leave
.
<EOS>
Emma
remained
very
well
pleased
with
this
beginning
of
the
acquaintance
,
and
could
now
engage
to
think
of
them
all
at
Randalls
any
hour
of
the
day
,
with
full
confidence
in
their
comfort
.
    
<EOS>
The
next
morning
brought
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
again
.
<EOS>
He
came
with
Mrs.
Weston
,
to
whom
and
to
Highbury
he
seemed
to
take
very
cordially
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
sitting
with
her
,
it
appeared
,
most
companionably
at
home
,
till
her
usual
hour
of
exercise
;
and
on
being
desired
to
chuse
their
walk
,
immediately
fixed
on
Highbury
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
did
not
doubt
there
being
very
pleasant
walks
in
every
direction
,
but
if
left
to
him
,
he
should
always
chuse
the
same
.
<EOS>
Highbury
,
that
airy
,
cheerful
,
happy
-
looking
Highbury
,
would
be
his
constant
attraction
.
"
 
<EOS>
Highbury
,
with
Mrs.
Weston
,
stood
for
Hartfield
;
and
she
trusted
to
its
bearing
the
same
construction
with
him
.
<EOS>
They
walked
thither
directly
.
  
<EOS>
Emma
had
hardly
expected
them
:
for
Mr.
Weston
,
who
had
called
in
for
half
a
minute
,
in
order
to
hear
that
his
son
was
very
handsome
,
knew
nothing
of
their
plans
;
and
it
was
an
agreeable
surprize
to
her
,
therefore
,
to
perceive
them
walking
up
to
the
house
together
,
arm
in
arm
.
<EOS>
She
was
wanting
to
see
him
again
,
and
especially
to
see
him
in
company
with
Mrs.
Weston
,
upon
his
behaviour
to
whom
her
opinion
of
him
was
to
depend
.
<EOS>
If
he
were
deficient
there
,
nothing
should
make
amends
for
it
.
<EOS>
But
on
seeing
them
together
,
she
became
perfectly
satisfied
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
merely
in
fine
words
or
hyperbolical
compliment
that
he
paid
his
duty
;
nothing
could
be
more
proper
or
pleasing
than
his
whole
manner
to
her
 
nothing
could
more
agreeably
denote
his
wish
of
considering
her
as
a
friend
and
securing
her
affection
.
<EOS>
And
there
was
time
enough
for
Emma
to
form
a
reasonable
judgment
,
as
their
visit
included
all
the
rest
of
the
morning
.
<EOS>
They
were
all
three
walking
about
together
for
an
hour
or
two
 
first
round
the
shrubberies
of
Hartfield
,
and
afterwards
in
Highbury
.
<EOS>
He
was
delighted
with
every
thing
;
admired
Hartfield
sufficiently
for
Mr.
Woodhouse
's
ear
;
and
when
their
going
farther
was
resolved
on
,
confessed
his
wish
to
be
made
acquainted
with
the
whole
village
,
and
found
matter
of
commendation
and
interest
much
oftener
than
Emma
could
have
supposed
.
  
<EOS>
Some
of
the
objects
of
his
curiosity
spoke
very
amiable
feelings
.
<EOS>
He
begged
to
be
shewn
the
house
which
his
father
had
lived
in
so
long
,
and
which
had
been
the
home
of
his
father
's
father
;
and
on
recollecting
that
an
old
woman
who
had
nursed
him
was
still
living
,
walked
in
quest
of
her
cottage
from
one
end
of
the
street
to
the
other
;
and
though
in
some
points
of
pursuit
or
observation
there
was
no
positive
merit
<EOS>
,
they
shewed
,
altogether
,
a
good
-
will
towards
Highbury
in
general
,
which
must
be
very
like
a
merit
to
those
he
was
with
.
  
<EOS>
Emma
watched
and
decided
,
that
with
such
feelings
as
were
now
shewn
,
it
could
not
be
fairly
supposed
that
he
had
been
ever
voluntarily
absenting
himself
;
that
he
had
not
been
acting
a
part
,
or
making
a
parade
of
insincere
professions
;
and
that
Mr.
Knightley
certainly
had
not
done
him
justice
.
  
<EOS>
Their
first
pause
was
at
the
Crown
Inn
,
an
inconsiderable
house
,
though
the
principal
one
of
the
sort
,
where
a
couple
of
pair
of
post
-
horses
were
kept
,
more
for
the
convenience
of
the
neighbourhood
than
from
any
run
on
the
road
;
and
his
companions
had
not
expected
to
be
detained
by
any
interest
excited
there
;
but
in
passing
it
they
gave
the
history
of
the
large
room
visibly
added
;
it
had
been
built
many
years
ago
for
a
ball
-
room
,
and
while
the
neighbourhood
had
been
in
a
particularly
populous
,
dancing
state
,
had
been
occasionally
used
as
such
;
 
but
such
brilliant
days
had
long
passed
away
,
and
now
the
highest
purpose
for
which
it
was
ever
wanted
was
to
accommodate
a
whist
club
established
among
the
gentlemen
and
half
-
gentlemen
of
the
place
.
<EOS>
He
was
immediately
interested
.
<EOS>
Its
character
as
a
ball
-
room
caught
him
;
and
instead
of
passing
on
,
he
stopt
for
several
minutes
at
the
two
superior
sashed
windows
which
were
open
,
to
look
in
and
contemplate
its
capabilities
,
and
lament
that
its
original
purpose
should
have
ceased
.
<EOS>
He
saw
no
fault
in
the
room
,
he
would
acknowledge
none
which
they
suggested
.
<EOS>
No
,
it
was
long
enough
,
broad
enough
,
handsome
enough
.
<EOS>
It
would
hold
the
very
number
for
comfort
.
<EOS>
They
ought
to
have
balls
there
at
least
every
fortnight
through
the
winter
.
<EOS>
Why
had
not
Miss
Woodhouse
revived
the
former
good
old
days
of
the
room
?
 
<EOS>
She
who
could
do
any
thing
in
Highbury
!
<EOS>
The
want
of
proper
families
in
the
place
,
and
the
conviction
that
none
beyond
the
place
and
its
immediate
environs
could
be
tempted
to
attend
,
were
mentioned
;
but
he
was
not
satisfied
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
be
persuaded
that
so
many
good
-
looking
houses
as
he
saw
around
him
,
could
not
furnish
numbers
enough
for
such
a
meeting
;
and
even
when
particulars
were
given
and
families
described
,
he
was
still
unwilling
to
admit
that
the
inconvenience
of
such
a
mixture
would
be
any
thing
,
or
that
there
would
be
the
smallest
difficulty
in
every
body
's
returning
into
their
proper
place
the
next
morning
.
<EOS>
He
argued
like
a
young
man
very
much
bent
on
dancing
;
and
Emma
was
rather
surprized
to
see
the
constitution
of
the
Weston
prevail
so
decidedly
against
the
habits
of
the
Churchills
.
<EOS>
He
seemed
to
have
all
the
life
and
spirit
,
cheerful
feelings
,
and
social
inclinations
of
his
father
,
and
nothing
of
the
pride
or
reserve
of
Enscombe
.
<EOS>
Of
pride
,
indeed
,
there
was
,
perhaps
,
scarcely
enough
;
his
indifference
to
a
confusion
of
rank
,
bordered
too
much
on
inelegance
of
mind
.
<EOS>
He
could
be
no
judge
,
however
,
of
the
evil
he
was
holding
cheap
.
<EOS>
It
was
but
an
effusion
of
lively
spirits
.
  
<EOS>
At
last
he
was
persuaded
to
move
on
from
the
front
of
the
Crown
;
and
being
now
almost
facing
the
house
where
the
Bateses
lodged
,
Emma
recollected
his
intended
visit
the
day
before
,
and
asked
him
if
he
had
paid
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
oh
!
<EOS>
yes
"
 
<EOS>
he
replied
;
"
I
was
just
going
to
mention
it
.
<EOS>
A
very
successful
visit
:
 
<EOS>
I
saw
all
the
three
ladies
;
and
felt
very
much
obliged
to
you
for
your
preparatory
hint
.
<EOS>
If
the
talking
aunt
had
taken
me
quite
by
surprize
,
it
must
have
been
the
death
of
me
.
<EOS>
As
it
was
,
I
was
only
betrayed
into
paying
a
most
unreasonable
visit
.
<EOS>
Ten
minutes
would
have
been
all
that
was
necessary
,
perhaps
all
that
was
proper
;
and
I
had
told
my
father
I
should
certainly
be
at
home
before
him
 
<EOS>
but
there
was
no
getting
away
,
no
pause
;
and
,
to
my
utter
astonishment
,
I
found
,
when
he
(
finding
me
nowhere
else
)
joined
me
there
at
last
,
that
I
had
been
actually
sitting
with
them
very
nearly
three
-
quarters
of
an
hour
.
<EOS>
The
good
lady
had
not
given
me
the
possibility
of
escape
before
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
how
did
you
think
Miss
Fairfax
looking
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Ill
,
very
ill
 
<EOS>
that
is
,
if
a
young
lady
can
ever
be
allowed
to
look
ill
.
<EOS>
But
the
expression
is
hardly
admissible
,
Mrs.
Weston
,
is
it
?
<EOS>
Ladies
can
never
look
ill
.
<EOS>
And
,
seriously
,
Miss
Fairfax
is
naturally
so
pale
,
as
almost
always
to
give
the
appearance
of
ill
health
.
 
<EOS>
A
most
deplorable
want
of
complexion
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
would
not
agree
to
this
,
and
began
a
warm
defence
of
Miss
Fairfax
's
complexion
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
certainly
never
brilliant
,
but
she
would
not
allow
it
to
have
a
sickly
hue
in
general
;
and
there
was
a
softness
and
delicacy
in
her
skin
which
gave
peculiar
elegance
to
the
character
of
her
face
.
"
<EOS>
He
listened
with
all
due
deference
;
acknowledged
that
he
had
heard
many
people
say
the
same
 
<EOS>
but
yet
he
must
confess
,
that
to
him
nothing
could
make
amends
for
the
want
of
the
fine
glow
of
health
.
<EOS>
Where
features
were
indifferent
,
a
fine
complexion
gave
beauty
to
them
all
;
and
where
they
were
good
,
the
effect
was
 
fortunately
<EOS>
he
need
not
attempt
to
describe
what
the
effect
was
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
said
Emma
,
"
there
is
no
disputing
about
taste
.
 
<EOS>
At
least
you
admire
her
except
her
complexion
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
shook
his
head
and
laughed
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
separate
Miss
Fairfax
and
her
complexion
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
you
see
her
often
at
Weymouth
?
<EOS>
Were
you
often
in
the
same
society
?
"
  
<EOS>
At
this
moment
they
were
approaching
Ford
's
,
and
he
hastily
exclaimed
,
"
Ha
!
<EOS>
this
must
be
the
very
shop
that
every
body
attends
every
day
of
their
lives
,
as
my
father
informs
me
.
<EOS>
He
comes
to
Highbury
himself
,
he
says
,
six
days
out
of
the
seven
,
and
has
always
business
at
Ford
's
.
<EOS>
If
it
be
not
inconvenient
to
you
,
pray
let
us
go
in
,
that
I
may
prove
myself
to
belong
to
the
place
,
to
be
a
true
citizen
of
Highbury
.
<EOS>
I
must
buy
something
at
Ford
's
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
taking
out
my
freedom
.
 
<EOS>
I
dare
say
they
sell
gloves
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
yes
,
gloves
and
every
thing
.
<EOS>
I
do
admire
your
patriotism
.
<EOS>
You
will
be
adored
in
Highbury
.
<EOS>
You
were
very
popular
before
you
came
,
because
you
were
Mr.
Weston
's
son
 
but
lay
out
half
a
guinea
at
Ford
's
,
and
your
popularity
will
stand
upon
your
own
virtues
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
They
went
in
;
and
while
the
sleek
,
well
-
tied
parcels
of
"
Men
's
Beavers
"
and
"
York
Tan
"
were
bringing
down
and
displaying
on
the
counter
,
he
said
 
<EOS>
"
But
I
beg
your
pardon
,
Miss
Woodhouse
<EOS>
,
you
were
speaking
to
me
,
you
were
saying
something
at
the
very
moment
of
this
burst
of
my
_
amor
<EOS>
_
_
patriae
<EOS>
_
.
<EOS>
Do
not
let
me
lose
it
.
<EOS>
I
assure
you
the
utmost
stretch
of
public
fame
would
not
make
me
amends
for
the
loss
of
any
happiness
in
private
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
merely
asked
,
whether
you
had
known
much
of
Miss
Fairfax
and
her
party
at
Weymouth
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
now
that
I
understand
your
question
,
I
must
pronounce
it
to
be
a
very
unfair
one
.
<EOS>
It
is
always
the
lady
's
right
to
decide
on
the
degree
of
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
Miss
Fairfax
must
already
have
given
her
account
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
not
commit
myself
by
claiming
more
than
she
may
chuse
to
allow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
word
!
<EOS>
you
answer
as
discreetly
as
she
could
do
herself
.
<EOS>
But
her
account
of
every
thing
leaves
so
much
to
be
guessed
,
she
is
so
very
reserved
,
so
very
unwilling
to
give
the
least
information
about
any
body
,
that
I
really
think
you
may
say
what
you
like
of
your
acquaintance
with
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
May
I
,
indeed
?
 
<EOS>
Then
I
will
speak
the
truth
,
and
nothing
suits
me
so
well
.
<EOS>
I
met
her
frequently
at
Weymouth
.
<EOS>
I
had
known
the
Campbells
a
little
in
town
;
and
at
Weymouth
we
were
very
much
in
the
same
set
.
<EOS>
Colonel
Campbell
is
a
very
agreeable
man
,
and
Mrs.
Campbell
a
friendly
,
warm
-
hearted
woman
.
<EOS>
I
like
them
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
Miss
Fairfax
's
situation
in
life
,
I
conclude
;
what
she
is
destined
to
be
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
 
(
rather
hesitatingly
)
 
<EOS>
I
believe
I
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
get
upon
delicate
subjects
,
Emma
,
"
said
Mrs.
Weston
smiling
;
"
remember
that
I
am
here
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
hardly
knows
what
to
say
when
you
speak
of
Miss
Fairfax
's
situation
in
life
.
<EOS>
I
will
move
a
little
farther
off
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
certainly
do
forget
to
think
of
_
her
_
,
"
said
Emma
,
"
as
having
ever
been
any
thing
but
my
friend
and
my
dearest
friend
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
looked
as
if
he
fully
understood
and
honoured
such
a
sentiment
.
  
<EOS>
When
the
gloves
were
bought
,
and
they
had
quitted
the
shop
again
,
"
Did
you
ever
hear
the
young
lady
we
were
speaking
of
,
play
?
"
said
Frank
Churchill
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ever
hear
her
!
"
<EOS>
repeated
Emma
.
<EOS>
"
You
forget
how
much
she
belongs
to
Highbury
.
<EOS>
I
have
heard
her
every
year
of
our
lives
since
we
both
began
.
<EOS>
She
plays
charmingly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
think
so
,
do
you
?
 
<EOS>
I
wanted
the
opinion
of
some
one
who
could
really
judge
.
<EOS>
She
appeared
to
me
to
play
well
,
that
is
,
with
considerable
taste
,
but
I
know
nothing
of
the
matter
myself
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
excessively
fond
of
music
,
but
without
the
smallest
skill
or
right
of
judging
of
any
body
's
performance
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
used
to
hear
her
's
admired
;
and
I
remember
one
proof
of
her
being
thought
to
play
well
:
 
a
man
,
a
very
musical
man
,
and
in
love
with
another
woman
 
engaged
to
her
 
on
the
point
of
marriage
 
would
yet
never
ask
that
other
woman
to
sit
down
to
the
instrument
,
if
the
lady
in
question
could
sit
down
instead
 
never
seemed
to
like
to
hear
one
if
he
could
hear
the
other
.
<EOS>
That
,
I
thought
,
in
a
man
of
known
musical
talent
,
was
some
proof
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Proof
indeed
!
"
said
Emma
,
highly
amused
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Dixon
is
very
musical
,
is
he
?
<EOS>
We
shall
know
more
about
them
all
,
in
half
an
hour
,
from
you
,
than
Miss
Fairfax
would
have
vouchsafed
in
half
a
year
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Mr.
Dixon
and
Miss
Campbell
were
the
persons
;
and
I
thought
it
a
very
strong
proof
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Certainly
 
very
strong
it
was
;
to
own
the
truth
,
a
great
deal
stronger
than
,
if
_
I
_
had
been
Miss
Campbell
,
would
have
been
at
all
agreeable
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
excuse
a
man
's
having
more
music
than
love
 
more
ear
than
eye
 
a
more
acute
sensibility
to
fine
sounds
than
to
my
feelings
.
<EOS>
How
did
Miss
Campbell
appear
to
like
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
her
very
particular
friend
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Poor
comfort
!
"
said
Emma
,
laughing
.
<EOS>
"
One
would
rather
have
a
stranger
preferred
than
one
's
very
particular
friend
 
with
a
stranger
it
might
not
recur
again
 
but
the
misery
of
having
a
very
particular
friend
always
at
hand
,
to
do
every
thing
better
than
one
does
oneself
!
 
<EOS>
Poor
Mrs.
Dixon
!
<EOS>
Well
,
I
am
glad
she
is
gone
to
settle
in
Ireland
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
right
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
very
flattering
to
Miss
Campbell
;
but
she
really
did
not
seem
to
feel
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
So
much
the
better
 
or
so
much
the
worse
:
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
which
.
<EOS>
But
be
it
sweetness
or
be
it
stupidity
in
her
 
quickness
of
friendship
,
or
dulness
of
feeling
 
<EOS>
there
was
one
person
,
I
think
,
<EOS>
who
must
have
felt
it
:
Miss
Fairfax
herself
.
<EOS>
She
must
have
felt
the
improper
and
dangerous
distinction
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
As
to
that
 
I
do
not
 
"
  
"
Oh
!
do
not
imagine
that
I
expect
an
account
of
Miss
Fairfax
's
sensations
from
you
,
or
from
any
body
else
.
<EOS>
They
are
known
to
no
human
being
,
I
guess
,
but
herself
.
<EOS>
But
if
she
continued
to
play
whenever
she
was
asked
by
Mr.
Dixon
,
one
may
guess
what
one
chuses
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
appeared
such
a
perfectly
good
understanding
among
them
all
 
<EOS>
"
he
began
rather
quickly
,
but
checking
himself
,
added
,
"
however
<EOS>
,
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
say
on
what
terms
they
really
were
 
how
it
might
all
be
behind
the
scenes
.
<EOS>
I
can
only
say
that
there
was
smoothness
outwardly
.
<EOS>
But
you
,
who
have
known
Miss
Fairfax
from
a
child
,
must
be
a
better
judge
of
her
character
,
and
of
how
she
is
likely
to
conduct
herself
in
critical
situations
,
than
I
can
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
known
her
from
a
child
,
undoubtedly
;
we
have
been
children
and
women
together
;
and
it
is
natural
to
suppose
that
we
should
be
intimate
,
 
that
we
should
have
taken
to
each
other
whenever
she
visited
her
friends
.
<EOS>
But
we
never
did
.
<EOS>
I
hardly
know
how
it
has
happened
;
a
little
,
perhaps
,
from
that
wickedness
on
my
side
which
was
prone
to
take
disgust
towards
a
girl
so
idolized
and
so
cried
up
as
she
always
was
,
by
her
aunt
and
grandmother
,
and
all
their
set
.
<EOS>
And
then
,
her
reserve
 
<EOS>
I
never
could
attach
myself
to
any
one
so
completely
reserved
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
most
repulsive
quality
,
indeed
,
"
said
he
.
<EOS>
"
Oftentimes
very
convenient
,
no
doubt
,
but
never
pleasing
.
<EOS>
There
is
safety
in
reserve
,
but
no
attraction
.
<EOS>
One
can
not
love
a
reserved
person
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
till
the
reserve
ceases
towards
oneself
;
and
then
the
attraction
may
be
the
greater
.
<EOS>
But
I
must
be
more
in
want
of
a
friend
,
or
an
agreeable
companion
,
than
I
have
yet
been
,
to
take
the
trouble
of
conquering
any
body
's
reserve
to
procure
one
.
<EOS>
Intimacy
between
Miss
Fairfax
and
me
is
quite
out
of
the
question
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
reason
to
think
ill
of
her
 
not
the
least
 
except
that
such
extreme
and
perpetual
cautiousness
of
word
and
manner
,
such
a
dread
of
giving
a
distinct
idea
about
any
body
,
is
apt
to
suggest
suspicions
of
there
being
something
to
conceal
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
perfectly
agreed
with
her
:
and
after
walking
together
so
long
,
and
thinking
so
much
alike
,
Emma
felt
herself
so
well
acquainted
with
him
,
that
she
could
hardly
believe
it
to
be
only
their
second
meeting
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
exactly
what
she
had
expected
;
less
of
the
man
of
the
world
in
some
of
his
notions
,
less
of
the
spoiled
child
of
fortune
,
therefore
better
than
she
had
expected
.
<EOS>
His
ideas
seemed
more
moderate
 
his
feelings
warmer
.
<EOS>
She
was
particularly
struck
by
his
manner
of
considering
Mr.
Elton
's
house
,
which
,
as
well
as
the
church
,
he
would
go
and
look
at
,
and
would
not
join
them
in
finding
much
fault
with
.
<EOS>
No
,
he
could
not
believe
it
a
bad
house
;
not
such
a
house
as
a
man
was
to
be
pitied
for
having
.
<EOS>
If
it
were
to
be
shared
with
the
woman
he
loved
,
he
could
not
think
any
man
to
be
pitied
for
having
that
house
.
<EOS>
There
must
be
ample
room
in
it
for
every
real
comfort
.
<EOS>
The
man
must
be
a
blockhead
who
wanted
more
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Weston
laughed
,
and
said
he
did
not
know
what
he
was
talking
about
.
<EOS>
Used
only
to
a
large
house
himself
,
and
without
ever
thinking
how
many
advantages
and
accommodations
were
attached
to
its
size
,
he
could
be
no
judge
of
the
privations
inevitably
belonging
to
a
small
one
.
<EOS>
But
Emma
,
in
her
own
mind
,
determined
that
he
_
did
_
know
what
he
was
talking
about
,
and
that
he
shewed
a
very
amiable
inclination
to
settle
early
in
life
,
and
to
marry
,
from
worthy
motives
.
<EOS>
He
might
not
be
aware
of
the
inroads
on
domestic
peace
to
be
occasioned
by
no
housekeeper
's
room
,
or
a
bad
butler
's
pantry
,
but
no
doubt
he
did
perfectly
feel
that
Enscombe
could
not
make
him
happy
,
and
that
whenever
he
were
attached
,
he
would
willingly
give
up
much
of
wealth
to
be
allowed
an
early
establishment
.
    
<EOS>
Emma
's
very
good
opinion
of
Frank
Churchill
was
a
little
shaken
the
following
day
,
by
hearing
that
he
was
gone
off
to
London
,
merely
to
have
his
hair
cut
.
<EOS>
A
sudden
freak
seemed
to
have
seized
him
at
breakfast
,
and
he
had
sent
for
a
chaise
and
set
off
,
intending
to
return
to
dinner
,
but
with
no
more
important
view
that
appeared
than
having
his
hair
cut
.
<EOS>
There
was
certainly
no
harm
in
his
travelling
sixteen
miles
twice
over
on
such
an
errand
;
but
there
was
an
air
of
foppery
and
nonsense
in
it
which
she
could
not
approve
.
<EOS>
It
did
not
accord
with
the
rationality
of
plan
,
the
moderation
in
expense
,
or
even
the
unselfish
warmth
of
heart
,
which
she
had
believed
herself
to
discern
in
him
yesterday
.
<EOS>
Vanity
,
extravagance
,
love
of
change
,
restlessness
of
temper
,
which
must
be
doing
something
,
good
or
bad
;
heedlessness
as
to
the
pleasure
of
his
father
and
Mrs.
Weston
,
indifferent
as
to
how
his
conduct
might
appear
in
general
;
he
became
liable
to
all
these
charges
.
<EOS>
His
father
only
called
him
a
coxcomb
,
and
thought
it
a
very
good
story
;
but
that
Mrs.
Weston
did
not
like
it
,
was
clear
enough
,
by
her
passing
it
over
as
quickly
as
possible
,
and
making
no
other
comment
than
that
"
all
young
people
would
have
their
little
whims
.
"
  
<EOS>
With
the
exception
of
this
little
blot
,
Emma
found
that
his
visit
hitherto
had
given
her
friend
only
good
ideas
of
him
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Weston
was
very
ready
to
say
how
attentive
and
pleasant
a
companion
he
made
himself
 
how
much
she
saw
to
like
in
his
disposition
altogether
.
<EOS>
He
appeared
to
have
a
very
open
temper
 
certainly
a
very
cheerful
and
lively
one
;
she
could
observe
nothing
wrong
in
his
notions
,
a
great
deal
decidedly
right
;
he
spoke
of
his
uncle
with
warm
regard
,
was
fond
of
talking
of
him
 
<EOS>
said
he
would
be
the
best
man
in
the
world
if
he
were
left
to
himself
;
and
though
there
was
no
being
attached
to
the
aunt
,
he
acknowledged
her
kindness
with
gratitude
,
and
seemed
to
mean
always
to
speak
of
her
with
respect
.
<EOS>
This
was
all
very
promising
;
and
,
but
for
such
an
unfortunate
fancy
for
having
his
hair
cut
,
there
was
nothing
to
denote
him
unworthy
of
the
distinguished
honour
which
her
imagination
had
given
him
;
the
honour
,
if
not
of
being
really
in
love
with
her
,
of
being
at
least
very
near
it
,
and
saved
only
by
her
own
indifference
 
(
for
still
her
resolution
held
of
never
marrying
)
 
<EOS>
the
honour
,
in
short
,
of
being
marked
out
for
her
by
all
their
joint
acquaintance
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Weston
,
on
his
side
,
added
a
virtue
to
the
account
which
must
have
some
weight
.
<EOS>
He
gave
her
to
understand
that
Frank
admired
her
extremely
 
thought
her
very
beautiful
and
very
charming
;
and
with
so
much
to
be
said
for
him
altogether
,
she
found
she
must
not
judge
him
harshly
.
<EOS>
As
Mrs.
Weston
observed
,
"
all
young
people
would
have
their
little
whims
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
one
person
among
his
new
acquaintance
in
Surry
,
not
so
leniently
disposed
.
<EOS>
In
general
he
was
judged
,
throughout
the
parishes
of
Donwell
and
Highbury
,
with
great
candour
;
liberal
allowances
were
made
for
the
little
excesses
of
such
a
handsome
young
man
 
one
who
smiled
so
often
and
bowed
so
well
;
but
there
was
one
spirit
among
them
not
to
be
softened
,
from
its
power
of
censure
,
by
bows
or
smiles
 
Mr.
Knightley
.
<EOS>
The
circumstance
was
told
him
at
Hartfield
;
for
the
moment
,
he
was
silent
;
but
Emma
heard
him
almost
immediately
afterwards
say
to
himself
,
over
a
newspaper
he
held
in
his
hand
,
"
Hum
!
<EOS>
just
the
trifling
,
silly
fellow
<EOS>
I
took
him
for
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
had
half
a
mind
to
resent
;
but
an
instant
's
observation
convinced
her
that
it
was
really
said
only
to
relieve
his
own
feelings
,
and
not
meant
to
provoke
;
and
therefore
she
let
it
pass
.
  
<EOS>
Although
in
one
instance
the
bearers
of
not
good
tidings
,
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Weston
's
visit
this
morning
was
in
another
respect
particularly
opportune
.
<EOS>
Something
occurred
while
they
were
at
Hartfield
,
to
make
Emma
want
their
advice
;
and
,
which
was
still
more
lucky
,
she
wanted
exactly
the
advice
they
gave
.
  
<EOS>
This
was
the
occurrence
:
 
<EOS>
The
Coles
had
been
settled
some
years
in
Highbury
,
and
were
very
good
sort
of
people
 
friendly
,
liberal
,
and
unpretending
;
but
,
on
the
other
hand
,
they
were
of
low
origin
,
in
trade
,
and
only
moderately
genteel
.
<EOS>
On
their
first
coming
into
the
country
,
they
had
lived
in
proportion
to
their
income
,
quietly
,
keeping
little
company
,
and
that
little
unexpensively
;
but
the
last
year
or
two
had
brought
them
a
considerable
increase
of
means
 
<EOS>
the
house
in
town
had
yielded
greater
profits
,
and
fortune
in
general
had
smiled
on
them
.
<EOS>
With
their
wealth
,
their
views
increased
;
their
want
of
a
larger
house
,
their
inclination
for
more
company
.
<EOS>
They
added
to
their
house
,
to
their
number
of
servants
,
to
their
expenses
of
every
sort
;
and
by
this
time
were
,
in
fortune
and
style
of
living
,
second
only
to
the
family
at
Hartfield
.
<EOS>
Their
love
of
society
,
and
their
new
dining
-
room
,
prepared
every
body
for
their
keeping
dinner
-
company
;
and
a
few
parties
,
chiefly
among
the
single
men
,
had
already
taken
place
.
<EOS>
The
regular
and
best
families
Emma
could
hardly
suppose
they
would
presume
to
invite
 
neither
Donwell
,
nor
Hartfield
,
nor
Randalls
.
<EOS>
Nothing
should
tempt
_
her
_
<EOS>
to
go
,
if
they
did
;
and
she
regretted
that
her
father
's
known
habits
would
be
giving
her
refusal
less
meaning
than
she
could
wish
.
<EOS>
The
Coles
were
very
respectable
in
their
way
,
but
they
ought
to
be
taught
that
it
was
not
for
them
to
arrange
the
terms
on
which
the
superior
families
would
visit
them
.
<EOS>
This
lesson
,
she
very
much
feared
,
they
would
receive
only
from
herself
;
she
had
little
hope
of
Mr.
Knightley
,
none
of
Mr.
Weston
.
  
<EOS>
But
she
had
made
up
her
mind
how
to
meet
this
presumption
so
many
weeks
before
it
appeared
,
that
when
the
insult
came
at
last
,
it
found
her
very
differently
affected
.
<EOS>
Donwell
and
Randalls
had
received
their
invitation
,
and
none
had
come
for
her
father
and
herself
;
and
Mrs.
Weston
's
accounting
for
it
with
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
they
will
not
take
the
liberty
with
you
;
they
know
you
do
not
dine
out
,
"
was
not
quite
sufficient
.
<EOS>
She
felt
that
she
should
like
to
have
had
the
power
of
refusal
;
and
afterwards
,
as
the
idea
of
the
party
to
be
assembled
there
,
consisting
precisely
of
those
whose
society
was
dearest
to
her
,
occurred
again
and
again
,
she
did
not
know
that
she
might
not
have
been
tempted
to
accept
.
<EOS>
Harriet
was
to
be
there
in
the
evening
,
and
the
Bateses
.
<EOS>
They
had
been
speaking
of
it
as
they
walked
about
Highbury
the
day
before
,
and
Frank
Churchill
had
most
earnestly
lamented
her
absence
.
<EOS>
Might
not
the
evening
end
in
a
dance
?
<EOS>
had
been
a
question
of
his
.
<EOS>
The
bare
possibility
of
it
acted
as
a
farther
irritation
on
her
spirits
;
and
her
being
left
in
solitary
grandeur
,
even
supposing
the
omission
to
be
intended
as
a
compliment
,
was
but
poor
comfort
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
the
arrival
of
this
very
invitation
while
the
Westons
were
at
Hartfield
,
which
made
their
presence
so
acceptable
;
for
though
her
first
remark
,
on
reading
it
,
was
that
"
of
course
it
must
be
declined
,
"
she
so
very
soon
proceeded
to
ask
them
what
they
advised
her
to
do
,
that
their
advice
for
her
going
was
most
prompt
and
successful
.
  
<EOS>
She
owned
that
,
considering
every
thing
,
she
was
not
absolutely
without
inclination
for
the
party
.
<EOS>
The
Coles
expressed
themselves
so
properly
 
there
was
so
much
real
attention
in
the
manner
of
it
 
so
much
consideration
for
her
father
.
<EOS>
"
They
would
have
solicited
the
honour
earlier
,
but
had
been
waiting
the
arrival
of
a
folding
-
screen
from
London
,
which
they
hoped
might
keep
Mr.
Woodhouse
from
any
draught
of
air
,
and
therefore
induce
him
the
more
readily
to
give
them
the
honour
of
his
company
.
<EOS>
"
Upon
the
whole
,
she
was
very
persuadable
;
and
it
being
briefly
settled
among
themselves
how
it
might
be
done
without
neglecting
his
comfort
 
how
certainly
Mrs.
Goddard
,
if
not
Mrs.
Bates
,
might
be
depended
on
for
bearing
him
company
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Woodhouse
was
to
be
talked
into
an
acquiescence
of
his
daughter
's
going
out
to
dinner
on
a
day
now
near
at
hand
,
and
spending
the
whole
evening
away
from
him
.
<EOS>
As
for
_
his
_
going
,
Emma
did
not
wish
him
to
think
it
possible
,
the
hours
would
be
too
late
,
and
the
party
too
numerous
.
<EOS>
He
was
soon
pretty
well
resigned
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
fond
of
dinner
-
visiting
,
"
said
he
 
<EOS>
"
I
never
was
.
<EOS>
No
more
is
Emma
.
<EOS>
Late
hours
do
not
agree
with
us
.
<EOS>
I
am
sorry
<EOS>
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Cole
should
have
done
it
.
<EOS>
I
think
it
would
be
much
better
if
they
would
come
in
one
afternoon
next
summer
,
and
take
their
tea
with
us
 
<EOS>
take
us
in
their
afternoon
walk
;
which
they
might
do
,
as
our
hours
are
so
reasonable
,
and
yet
get
home
without
being
out
in
the
damp
of
the
evening
.
<EOS>
The
dews
of
a
summer
evening
are
what
I
would
not
expose
any
body
to
.
<EOS>
However
,
as
they
are
so
very
desirous
to
have
dear
Emma
dine
with
them
,
and
as
you
will
both
be
there
,
and
Mr.
Knightley
too
,
to
take
care
of
her
,
I
can
not
wish
to
prevent
it
,
provided
the
weather
be
what
it
ought
,
<EOS>
neither
damp
,
nor
cold
,
nor
windy
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Then
turning
to
Mrs.
Weston
,
with
a
look
of
gentle
reproach
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
Miss
Taylor
,
if
you
had
not
married
,
you
would
have
staid
at
home
with
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
sir
,
"
cried
Mr.
Weston
,
"
as
I
took
Miss
Taylor
away
,
it
is
incumbent
on
me
to
supply
her
place
,
if
I
can
;
and
I
will
step
to
Mrs.
Goddard
in
a
moment
,
if
you
wish
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
But
the
idea
of
any
thing
to
be
done
in
a
_
moment
_
,
was
increasing
,
not
lessening
,
Mr.
Woodhouse
's
agitation
.
<EOS>
The
ladies
knew
better
how
to
allay
it
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Weston
must
be
quiet
,
and
every
thing
deliberately
arranged
.
  
<EOS>
With
this
treatment
,
Mr.
Woodhouse
was
soon
composed
enough
for
talking
as
usual
.
<EOS>
"
He
should
be
happy
to
see
Mrs.
Goddard
.
<EOS>
He
had
a
great
regard
for
Mrs.
Goddard
;
and
Emma
should
write
a
line
,
and
invite
her
.
<EOS>
James
could
take
the
note
.
<EOS>
But
first
of
all
,
there
must
be
an
answer
written
to
Mrs.
Cole
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
make
my
excuses
,
my
dear
,
as
civilly
as
possible
.
<EOS>
You
will
say
that
I
am
quite
an
invalid
,
and
go
no
where
,
and
therefore
must
decline
their
obliging
invitation
;
beginning
with
my
_
compliments
_
,
of
course
.
<EOS>
But
you
will
do
every
thing
right
.
<EOS>
I
need
not
tell
you
what
is
to
be
done
.
<EOS>
We
must
remember
to
let
James
know
that
the
carriage
will
be
wanted
on
Tuesday
.
<EOS>
I
shall
have
no
fears
for
you
with
him
.
<EOS>
We
have
never
been
there
above
once
since
the
new
approach
was
made
;
but
still
I
have
no
doubt
that
James
will
take
you
very
safely
.
<EOS>
And
when
you
get
there
,
you
must
tell
him
at
what
time
you
would
have
him
come
for
you
again
;
and
you
had
better
name
an
early
hour
.
<EOS>
You
will
not
like
staying
late
.
<EOS>
You
will
get
very
tired
when
tea
is
over
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
would
not
wish
me
to
come
away
before
I
am
tired
,
papa
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
no
,
my
love
;
but
you
will
soon
be
tired
.
<EOS>
There
will
be
a
great
many
people
talking
at
once
.
<EOS>
You
will
not
like
the
noise
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
But
,
my
dear
sir
,
"
cried
Mr.
Weston
,
"
if
Emma
comes
away
early
,
it
will
be
breaking
up
the
party
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
no
great
harm
if
it
does
,
"
said
Mr.
Woodhouse
.
<EOS>
"
The
sooner
every
party
breaks
up
,
the
better
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
do
not
consider
how
it
may
appear
to
the
Coles
.
<EOS>
Emma
's
going
away
directly
after
tea
might
be
giving
offence
.
<EOS>
They
are
good
-
natured
people
,
and
think
little
of
their
own
claims
;
but
still
they
must
feel
that
any
body
's
hurrying
away
is
no
great
compliment
;
and
Miss
Woodhouse
's
doing
it
would
be
more
thought
of
than
any
other
person
's
in
the
room
.
<EOS>
You
would
not
wish
to
disappoint
and
mortify
the
Coles
,
I
am
sure
,
sir
;
friendly
,
good
sort
of
people
as
ever
lived
,
and
who
have
been
your
neighbours
these
_
ten
_
years
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
No
,
upon
no
account
in
the
world
,
Mr.
Weston
;
I
am
much
obliged
to
you
for
reminding
me
.
<EOS>
I
should
be
extremely
sorry
to
be
giving
them
any
pain
.
<EOS>
I
know
what
worthy
people
they
are
.
<EOS>
Perry
tells
me
that
Mr.
Cole
never
touches
malt
liquor
.
<EOS>
You
would
not
think
it
to
look
at
him
,
but
he
is
bilious
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Cole
is
very
bilious
.
<EOS>
No
,
I
would
not
be
the
means
of
giving
them
any
pain
.
<EOS>
My
dear
Emma
,
we
must
consider
this
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
,
rather
than
run
the
risk
of
hurting
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Cole
,
you
would
stay
a
little
longer
than
you
might
wish
.
<EOS>
You
will
not
regard
being
tired
.
<EOS>
You
will
be
perfectly
safe
,
you
know
,
among
your
friends
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
yes
,
papa
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
fears
at
all
for
myself
;
and
I
should
have
no
scruples
of
staying
as
late
as
Mrs.
Weston
,
but
on
your
account
.
<EOS>
I
am
only
afraid
of
your
sitting
up
for
me
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
afraid
of
your
not
being
exceedingly
comfortable
with
Mrs.
Goddard
.
<EOS>
She
loves
piquet
,
you
know
;
but
when
she
is
gone
home
,
I
am
afraid
you
will
be
sitting
up
by
yourself
,
instead
of
going
to
bed
at
your
usual
time
 
and
the
idea
of
that
would
entirely
destroy
my
comfort
.
<EOS>
You
must
promise
me
not
to
sit
up
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
did
,
on
the
condition
of
some
promises
on
her
side
:
such
as
that
,
if
she
came
home
cold
,
she
would
be
sure
to
warm
herself
thoroughly
;
if
hungry
,
that
she
would
take
something
to
eat
;
that
her
own
maid
should
sit
up
for
her
;
and
that
Serle
and
the
butler
should
see
that
every
thing
were
safe
in
the
house
,
as
usual
.
    
<EOS>
Frank
Churchill
came
back
again
;
and
if
he
kept
his
father
's
dinner
waiting
,
it
was
not
known
at
Hartfield
;
for
Mrs.
Weston
was
too
anxious
for
his
being
a
favourite
with
Mr.
Woodhouse
,
to
betray
any
imperfection
which
could
be
concealed
.
  
<EOS>
He
came
back
,
had
had
his
hair
cut
,
and
laughed
at
himself
with
a
very
good
grace
,
but
without
seeming
really
at
all
ashamed
of
what
he
had
done
.
<EOS>
He
had
no
reason
to
wish
his
hair
longer
,
to
conceal
any
confusion
of
face
;
no
reason
to
wish
the
money
unspent
,
to
improve
his
spirits
.
<EOS>
He
was
quite
as
undaunted
and
as
lively
as
ever
;
and
,
after
seeing
him
,
Emma
thus
moralised
to
herself
:
    
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
whether
it
ought
to
be
so
,
but
certainly
silly
things
do
cease
to
be
silly
if
they
are
done
by
sensible
people
in
an
impudent
way
.
<EOS>
Wickedness
is
always
wickedness
,
but
folly
is
not
always
folly
.
 
<EOS>
It
depends
upon
the
character
of
those
who
handle
it
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Knightley
,
he
is
_
not
_
a
trifling
,
silly
young
man
.
<EOS>
If
he
were
,
he
would
have
done
this
differently
.
<EOS>
He
would
either
have
gloried
in
the
achievement
,
or
been
ashamed
of
it
.
<EOS>
There
would
have
been
either
the
ostentation
of
a
coxcomb
,
or
the
evasions
of
a
mind
too
weak
to
defend
its
own
vanities
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
I
am
perfectly
sure
that
he
is
not
trifling
or
silly
.
"
  
<EOS>
With
Tuesday
came
the
agreeable
prospect
of
seeing
him
again
,
and
for
a
longer
time
than
hitherto
;
of
judging
of
his
general
manners
,
and
by
inference
,
of
the
meaning
of
his
manners
towards
herself
;
of
guessing
how
soon
it
might
be
necessary
for
her
to
throw
coldness
into
her
air
;
and
of
fancying
what
the
observations
of
all
those
might
be
,
who
were
now
seeing
them
together
for
the
first
time
.
  
<EOS>
She
meant
to
be
very
happy
,
in
spite
of
the
scene
being
laid
at
Mr.
Cole
's
;
and
without
being
able
to
forget
that
among
the
failings
of
Mr.
Elton
,
even
in
the
days
of
his
favour
,
none
had
disturbed
her
more
than
his
propensity
to
dine
with
Mr.
Cole
.
  
<EOS>
Her
father
's
comfort
was
amply
secured
,
Mrs.
Bates
as
well
as
<EOS>
Mrs.
Goddard
being
able
to
come
;
and
her
last
pleasing
duty
,
before
she
left
the
house
,
was
to
pay
her
respects
to
them
as
they
sat
together
after
dinner
;
and
while
her
father
was
fondly
noticing
the
beauty
of
her
dress
,
to
make
the
two
ladies
all
the
amends
in
her
power
,
by
helping
them
to
large
slices
of
cake
and
full
glasses
of
wine
,
for
whatever
unwilling
self
-
denial
his
care
of
their
constitution
might
have
obliged
them
to
practise
during
the
meal
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
provided
a
plentiful
dinner
for
them
;
she
wished
she
could
know
that
they
had
been
allowed
to
eat
it
.
  
<EOS>
She
followed
another
carriage
to
Mr.
Cole
's
door
;
and
was
pleased
to
see
that
it
was
Mr.
Knightley
's
;
for
Mr.
Knightley
keeping
no
horses
,
having
little
spare
money
and
a
great
deal
of
health
,
activity
,
and
independence
,
was
too
apt
,
in
Emma
's
opinion
,
to
get
about
as
he
could
,
and
not
use
his
carriage
so
often
as
became
the
owner
of
Donwell
Abbey
.
<EOS>
She
had
an
opportunity
now
of
speaking
her
approbation
while
warm
from
her
heart
,
for
he
stopped
to
hand
her
out
.
  
<EOS>
"
This
is
coming
as
you
should
do
,
"
said
she
;
"
like
a
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
quite
glad
to
see
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
thanked
her
,
observing
,
"
How
lucky
that
we
should
arrive
at
the
same
moment
!
<EOS>
for
,
if
we
had
met
first
in
the
drawing
-
room
,
I
doubt
whether
you
would
have
discerned
me
to
be
more
of
a
gentleman
than
usual
.
 
<EOS>
You
might
not
have
distinguished
how
I
came
,
by
my
look
or
manner
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
I
should
,
I
am
sure
I
should
.
<EOS>
There
is
always
a
look
of
consciousness
or
bustle
when
people
come
in
a
way
which
they
know
to
be
beneath
them
.
<EOS>
You
think
you
carry
it
off
very
well
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
,
but
with
you
it
is
a
sort
of
bravado
,
an
air
of
affected
unconcern
;
I
always
observe
it
whenever
I
meet
you
under
those
circumstances
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
Now
_
you
have
nothing
to
try
for
.
<EOS>
You
are
not
afraid
of
being
supposed
ashamed
.
<EOS>
You
are
not
striving
to
look
taller
than
any
body
else
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
Now
_
I
shall
really
be
very
happy
to
walk
into
the
same
room
with
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nonsensical
girl
!
<EOS>
"
was
his
reply
,
but
not
at
all
in
anger
.
  
<EOS>
Emma
had
as
much
reason
to
be
satisfied
with
the
rest
of
the
party
as
with
Mr.
Knightley
.
<EOS>
She
was
received
with
a
cordial
respect
which
could
not
but
please
,
and
given
all
the
consequence
she
could
wish
for
.
<EOS>
When
the
Westons
arrived
,
the
kindest
looks
of
love
,
the
strongest
of
admiration
were
for
her
,
from
both
husband
and
wife
;
the
son
approached
her
with
a
cheerful
eagerness
which
marked
her
as
his
peculiar
object
,
and
at
dinner
she
found
him
seated
by
her
 
<EOS>
and
,
as
she
firmly
believed
,
not
without
some
dexterity
on
his
side
.
  
<EOS>
The
party
was
rather
large
,
as
it
included
one
other
family
,
a
proper
unobjectionable
country
family
,
whom
the
Coles
had
the
advantage
of
naming
among
their
acquaintance
,
and
the
male
part
of
Mr.
Cox
's
family
,
the
lawyer
of
Highbury
.
<EOS>
The
less
worthy
females
were
to
come
in
the
evening
,
with
Miss
Bates
,
Miss
Fairfax
,
and
Miss
Smith
;
but
already
,
at
dinner
,
they
were
too
numerous
for
any
subject
of
conversation
to
be
general
;
and
,
while
politics
and
Mr.
Elton
were
talked
over
,
Emma
could
fairly
surrender
all
her
attention
to
the
pleasantness
of
her
neighbour
.
<EOS>
The
first
remote
sound
to
which
she
felt
herself
obliged
to
attend
,
was
the
name
of
Jane
Fairfax
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Cole
seemed
to
be
relating
something
of
her
that
was
expected
to
be
very
interesting
.
<EOS>
She
listened
,
and
found
it
well
worth
listening
to
.
<EOS>
That
very
dear
part
of
Emma
,
her
fancy
,
received
an
amusing
supply
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Cole
was
telling
that
she
had
been
calling
on
Miss
Bates
,
and
as
soon
as
she
entered
the
room
had
been
struck
by
the
sight
of
a
pianoforte
 
a
very
elegant
looking
instrument
 
not
a
grand
,
but
a
large
-
sized
square
pianoforte
;
and
the
substance
of
the
story
,
the
end
of
all
the
dialogue
which
ensued
of
surprize
,
and
inquiry
,
and
congratulations
on
her
side
,
and
explanations
on
Miss
Bates
's
,
was
,
that
this
pianoforte
had
arrived
from
Broadwood
's
the
day
before
,
to
the
great
astonishment
of
both
aunt
and
niece
 
entirely
unexpected
;
that
at
first
,
by
Miss
Bates
's
account
,
Jane
herself
was
quite
at
a
loss
,
quite
bewildered
to
think
who
could
possibly
have
ordered
it
 
<EOS>
but
now
,
they
were
both
perfectly
satisfied
that
it
could
be
from
only
one
quarter
;
 
of
course
it
must
be
from
Colonel
Campbell
.
  
<EOS>
"
One
can
suppose
nothing
else
,
"
added
Mrs.
Cole
,
"
and
I
was
only
surprized
that
there
could
ever
have
been
a
doubt
.
<EOS>
But
Jane
,
it
seems
,
had
a
letter
from
them
very
lately
,
and
not
a
word
was
said
about
it
.
<EOS>
She
knows
their
ways
best
;
but
I
should
not
consider
their
silence
as
any
reason
for
their
not
meaning
to
make
the
present
.
<EOS>
They
might
chuse
to
surprize
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Cole
had
many
to
agree
with
her
;
every
body
who
spoke
on
the
subject
was
equally
convinced
that
it
must
come
from
Colonel
Campbell
,
and
equally
rejoiced
that
such
a
present
had
been
made
;
and
there
were
enough
ready
to
speak
to
allow
Emma
to
think
her
own
way
,
and
still
listen
to
Mrs.
Cole
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
declare
,
I
do
not
know
when
I
have
heard
any
thing
that
has
given
me
more
satisfaction
!
 
<EOS>
It
always
has
quite
hurt
me
that
Jane
Fairfax
,
who
plays
so
delightfully
,
should
not
have
an
instrument
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
quite
a
shame
,
especially
considering
how
many
houses
there
are
where
fine
instruments
are
absolutely
thrown
away
.
<EOS>
This
is
like
giving
ourselves
a
slap
,
to
be
sure
!
<EOS>
and
it
was
<EOS>
but
yesterday
I
was
telling
Mr.
Cole
,
I
really
was
ashamed
to
look
at
our
new
grand
pianoforte
in
the
drawing
-
room
,
while
I
do
not
know
one
note
from
another
,
and
our
little
girls
,
who
are
but
just
beginning
,
perhaps
may
never
make
any
thing
of
it
;
and
there
is
poor
Jane
Fairfax
,
who
is
mistress
of
music
,
has
not
any
thing
of
the
nature
of
an
instrument
,
not
even
the
pitifullest
old
spinet
in
the
world
,
to
amuse
herself
with
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
saying
this
to
Mr.
Cole
but
<EOS>
yesterday
,
and
he
quite
agreed
with
me
;
only
he
is
so
particularly
fond
of
music
that
he
could
not
help
indulging
himself
in
the
purchase
,
hoping
that
some
of
our
good
neighbours
might
be
so
obliging
occasionally
to
put
it
to
a
better
use
than
we
can
;
and
that
really
is
the
reason
why
the
instrument
was
bought
 
or
else
<EOS>
I
am
sure
we
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
We
are
in
great
hopes
that
Miss
Woodhouse
may
be
prevailed
with
to
try
it
this
evening
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Woodhouse
made
the
proper
acquiescence
;
and
finding
that
nothing
more
was
to
be
entrapped
from
any
communication
of
Mrs.
Cole
's
,
turned
to
Frank
Churchill
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
do
you
smile
?
"
said
she
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
why
do
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Me
!
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
I
smile
for
pleasure
at
Colonel
Campbell
's
being
<EOS>
so
rich
and
so
liberal
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
a
handsome
present
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Very
.
"
  
"
I
rather
wonder
that
it
was
never
made
before
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
Miss
Fairfax
has
never
been
staying
here
so
long
before
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Or
that
he
did
not
give
her
the
use
of
their
own
instrument
 
which
must
now
be
shut
up
in
London
,
untouched
by
any
body
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
a
grand
pianoforte
,
and
he
might
think
it
too
large
for
Mrs.
Bates
's
house
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
may
_
say
_
<EOS>
what
you
chuse
 
<EOS>
but
your
countenance
testifies
that
your
_
thoughts
_
on
this
subject
are
very
much
like
mine
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
.
<EOS>
I
rather
believe
you
are
giving
me
more
credit
for
acuteness
than
I
deserve
.
<EOS>
I
smile
because
you
smile
,
and
shall
probably
suspect
whatever
I
find
you
suspect
;
but
at
present
I
do
not
see
what
there
is
to
question
.
<EOS>
If
Colonel
Campbell
is
not
the
person
,
who
can
be
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
say
to
Mrs.
Dixon
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Dixon
!
<EOS>
very
true
indeed
.
<EOS>
I
had
not
thought
of
Mrs.
Dixon
.
<EOS>
She
must
know
as
well
as
her
father
,
how
acceptable
an
instrument
would
be
;
and
perhaps
the
mode
of
it
,
the
mystery
,
the
surprize
,
is
more
like
a
young
woman
's
scheme
than
an
elderly
man
's
.
<EOS>
It
is
Mrs.
Dixon
,
I
dare
say
.
<EOS>
I
told
you
that
your
suspicions
would
guide
mine
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
so
,
you
must
extend
your
suspicions
and
comprehend
_
Mr
_
.
<EOS>
Dixon
in
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Dixon
.
 
<EOS>
Very
well
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
I
immediately
perceive
that
it
must
be
the
joint
present
of
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Dixon
.
<EOS>
We
were
speaking
the
other
day
,
you
know
,
of
his
being
so
warm
an
admirer
of
her
performance
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
and
what
you
told
me
on
that
head
,
confirmed
an
idea
which
I
had
entertained
before
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
mean
to
reflect
upon
the
good
intentions
of
either
Mr.
Dixon
or
Miss
Fairfax
,
but
I
can
not
help
suspecting
either
that
,
after
making
his
proposals
to
her
friend
,
he
had
the
misfortune
to
fall
in
love
with
_
her
_
,
or
that
he
became
conscious
of
a
little
attachment
on
her
side
.
<EOS>
One
might
guess
twenty
things
without
guessing
exactly
the
right
;
but
I
am
sure
there
must
be
a
particular
cause
for
her
chusing
to
come
to
Highbury
instead
of
going
with
the
Campbells
to
Ireland
.
<EOS>
Here
,
she
must
be
leading
a
life
of
privation
and
penance
;
there
it
would
have
been
all
enjoyment
.
<EOS>
As
to
the
pretence
of
trying
her
native
air
,
I
look
upon
that
as
a
mere
excuse
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
summer
it
might
have
passed
;
but
what
can
any
body
's
native
air
do
for
them
in
the
months
of
January
,
February
,
and
March
?
<EOS>
Good
fires
and
carriages
would
be
much
more
to
the
purpose
in
most
cases
of
delicate
health
,
and
I
dare
say
in
her
's
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
require
you
to
adopt
all
my
suspicions
,
though
you
make
so
noble
a
profession
of
doing
it
,
but
I
honestly
tell
you
what
they
are
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
,
upon
my
word
,
they
have
an
air
of
great
probability
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Dixon
's
preference
of
her
music
to
her
friend
's
,
I
can
answer
for
being
very
decided
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
then
,
he
saved
her
life
.
<EOS>
Did
you
ever
hear
of
that
?
 
<EOS>
A
water
party
;
and
by
some
accident
she
was
falling
overboard
.
<EOS>
He
caught
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
did
.
<EOS>
I
was
there
 
one
of
the
party
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Were
you
really
?
 
<EOS>
Well
!
 
<EOS>
But
you
observed
nothing
of
course
,
<EOS>
for
it
seems
to
be
a
new
idea
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
had
been
there
,
I
think
I
should
have
made
some
discoveries
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
dare
say
you
would
;
but
I
,
simple
I
,
saw
nothing
but
the
fact
,
that
Miss
Fairfax
was
nearly
dashed
from
the
vessel
and
that
Mr.
Dixon
caught
her
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
the
work
of
a
moment
.
<EOS>
And
though
the
consequent
shock
and
alarm
was
very
great
and
much
more
durable
 
<EOS>
indeed
I
believe
it
was
half
an
hour
before
any
of
us
were
comfortable
again
 
<EOS>
yet
that
was
too
general
a
sensation
for
any
thing
of
peculiar
anxiety
to
be
observable
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
mean
to
say
,
however
,
that
you
might
not
have
made
discoveries
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
conversation
was
here
interrupted
.
<EOS>
They
were
called
on
to
share
in
the
awkwardness
of
a
rather
long
interval
between
the
courses
,
and
obliged
to
be
as
formal
and
as
orderly
as
the
others
;
but
when
the
table
was
again
safely
covered
,
when
every
corner
dish
was
placed
exactly
right
,
and
occupation
and
ease
were
generally
restored
,
Emma
said
,
  
"
The
arrival
of
this
pianoforte
is
decisive
with
me
.
<EOS>
I
wanted
to
know
a
little
more
,
and
this
tells
me
quite
enough
.
<EOS>
Depend
upon
it
,
we
shall
soon
hear
that
it
is
a
present
from
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Dixon
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
if
the
Dixons
should
absolutely
deny
all
knowledge
of
it
we
must
conclude
it
to
come
from
the
Campbells
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
am
sure
it
is
not
from
the
Campbells
.
<EOS>
Miss
Fairfax
knows
it
is
not
from
the
Campbells
,
or
they
would
have
been
guessed
at
first
.
<EOS>
She
would
not
have
been
puzzled
,
had
she
dared
fix
on
them
.
<EOS>
I
may
not
have
convinced
you
perhaps
,
but
I
am
perfectly
convinced
myself
that
Mr.
Dixon
is
a
principal
in
the
business
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
you
injure
me
if
you
suppose
me
unconvinced
.
<EOS>
Your
reasonings
carry
my
judgment
along
with
them
entirely
.
<EOS>
At
first
,
while
I
supposed
you
satisfied
that
Colonel
Campbell
was
the
giver
,
I
saw
it
only
as
paternal
kindness
,
and
thought
it
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
But
when
you
mentioned
Mrs.
Dixon
,
I
felt
how
much
more
probable
that
it
should
be
the
tribute
of
warm
female
friendship
.
<EOS>
And
now
I
can
see
it
in
no
other
light
than
as
an
offering
of
love
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
no
occasion
to
press
the
matter
farther
.
<EOS>
The
conviction
seemed
real
;
he
looked
as
if
he
felt
it
.
<EOS>
She
said
no
more
,
other
subjects
took
their
turn
;
and
the
rest
of
the
dinner
passed
away
;
the
dessert
succeeded
,
the
children
came
in
,
and
were
talked
to
and
admired
amid
the
usual
rate
of
conversation
;
a
few
clever
things
said
,
a
few
downright
silly
,
but
by
much
the
larger
proportion
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
 
nothing
worse
than
everyday
remarks
,
dull
repetitions
,
old
news
,
and
heavy
jokes
.
  
<EOS>
The
ladies
had
not
been
long
in
the
drawing
-
room
,
before
the
other
ladies
,
in
their
different
divisions
,
arrived
.
<EOS>
Emma
watched
the
entree
of
her
own
particular
little
friend
;
and
if
she
could
not
exult
in
her
dignity
and
grace
,
she
could
not
only
love
the
blooming
sweetness
and
the
artless
manner
,
but
could
most
heartily
rejoice
in
that
light
,
cheerful
,
unsentimental
disposition
which
allowed
her
so
many
alleviations
of
pleasure
,
in
the
midst
of
the
pangs
of
disappointed
affection
.
<EOS>
There
she
sat
 
and
who
would
have
guessed
how
many
tears
she
had
been
lately
shedding
?
<EOS>
To
be
in
company
,
nicely
dressed
herself
and
seeing
others
nicely
dressed
,
to
sit
and
smile
and
look
pretty
,
and
say
nothing
,
was
enough
for
the
happiness
of
the
present
hour
.
<EOS>
Jane
Fairfax
did
look
and
move
superior
;
but
Emma
suspected
she
might
have
been
glad
to
change
feelings
with
Harriet
,
very
glad
to
have
purchased
the
mortification
of
having
loved
 
<EOS>
yes
,
of
having
loved
even
Mr.
Elton
in
vain
 
by
the
surrender
of
all
the
dangerous
pleasure
of
knowing
herself
beloved
by
the
husband
of
her
friend
.
  
<EOS>
In
so
large
a
party
it
was
not
necessary
that
Emma
should
approach
her
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
wish
to
speak
of
the
pianoforte
,
she
felt
too
much
in
the
secret
herself
,
to
think
the
appearance
of
curiosity
or
interest
fair
,
and
therefore
purposely
kept
at
a
distance
;
but
by
the
others
,
the
subject
was
almost
immediately
introduced
,
and
she
saw
the
blush
of
consciousness
with
which
congratulations
were
received
,
the
blush
of
guilt
which
accompanied
the
name
of
"
my
excellent
friend
Colonel
Campbell
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Weston
,
kind
-
hearted
and
musical
,
was
particularly
interested
by
the
circumstance
,
and
Emma
could
not
help
being
amused
at
her
perseverance
in
dwelling
on
the
subject
;
and
having
so
much
to
ask
and
to
say
as
to
tone
,
touch
,
and
pedal
,
totally
unsuspicious
of
that
wish
of
saying
as
little
about
it
as
possible
,
which
she
plainly
read
in
the
fair
heroine
's
countenance
.
  
<EOS>
They
were
soon
joined
by
some
of
the
gentlemen
;
and
the
very
first
of
the
early
was
Frank
Churchill
.
<EOS>
In
he
walked
,
the
first
and
the
handsomest
;
and
after
paying
his
compliments
en
passant
to
Miss
Bates
and
her
niece
,
made
his
way
directly
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
circle
,
where
sat
Miss
Woodhouse
;
and
till
he
could
find
a
seat
by
her
,
would
not
sit
at
all
.
<EOS>
Emma
divined
what
every
body
present
must
be
thinking
.
<EOS>
She
was
his
object
,
and
every
body
must
perceive
it
.
<EOS>
She
introduced
him
to
her
friend
,
Miss
Smith
,
and
,
at
convenient
moments
afterwards
,
heard
what
each
thought
of
the
other
.
"
<EOS>
He
had
never
seen
so
lovely
a
face
,
and
was
delighted
with
her
naivete
.
"
<EOS>
And
she
,
"
Only
to
be
sure
it
was
paying
him
too
great
<EOS>
a
compliment
,
<EOS>
but
she
did
think
there
were
some
looks
a
little
like
Mr.
Elton
.
<EOS>
"
Emma
restrained
her
indignation
,
and
only
turned
from
her
in
silence
.
  
<EOS>
Smiles
of
intelligence
passed
between
her
and
the
gentleman
on
first
glancing
towards
Miss
Fairfax
;
but
it
was
most
prudent
to
avoid
speech
.
<EOS>
He
told
her
that
he
had
been
impatient
to
leave
the
dining
-
room
 
hated
sitting
long
 
was
always
the
first
to
move
when
he
could
 
that
his
father
,
Mr.
Knightley
,
Mr.
Cox
,
and
Mr.
Cole
,
were
left
very
busy
over
parish
business
 
<EOS>
that
as
long
as
he
had
staid
,
however
,
it
had
been
pleasant
enough
,
as
he
had
found
them
in
general
a
set
of
gentlemanlike
,
sensible
men
;
and
spoke
so
handsomely
of
Highbury
altogether
 
thought
it
so
abundant
in
agreeable
families
 
that
Emma
began
to
feel
she
had
been
used
to
despise
the
place
rather
too
much
.
<EOS>
She
questioned
him
as
to
the
society
in
Yorkshire
 
<EOS>
the
extent
of
the
neighbourhood
about
Enscombe
,
and
the
sort
;
and
could
make
out
from
his
answers
that
,
as
far
as
Enscombe
was
concerned
,
there
was
very
little
going
on
,
that
their
visitings
were
among
a
range
of
great
families
,
none
very
near
;
and
that
even
when
days
were
fixed
,
and
invitations
accepted
,
it
was
an
even
chance
that
Mrs.
Churchill
were
not
in
health
and
spirits
for
going
;
that
they
made
a
point
of
visiting
no
fresh
person
;
and
that
,
though
he
had
his
separate
engagements
,
it
was
not
without
difficulty
,
without
considerable
address
_
at
_
<EOS>
_
times
_
,
that
he
could
get
away
,
or
introduce
an
acquaintance
for
a
night
.
  
<EOS>
She
saw
that
Enscombe
could
not
satisfy
,
and
that
Highbury
,
taken
at
its
best
,
might
reasonably
please
a
young
man
who
had
more
retirement
at
home
than
he
liked
.
<EOS>
His
importance
at
Enscombe
was
very
evident
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
boast
,
but
it
naturally
betrayed
itself
,
that
he
had
persuaded
his
aunt
where
his
uncle
could
do
nothing
,
and
on
her
laughing
and
noticing
it
,
he
owned
that
he
believed
(
excepting
one
or
two
points
)
<EOS>
he
could
_
with
_
<EOS>
_
time
_
persuade
her
to
any
thing
.
<EOS>
One
of
those
points
on
which
his
influence
failed
,
he
then
mentioned
.
<EOS>
He
had
wanted
very
much
to
go
abroad
 
had
been
very
eager
indeed
to
be
allowed
to
travel
 
<EOS>
but
she
would
not
hear
of
it
.
<EOS>
This
had
happened
the
year
before
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
Now
_
,
he
said
,
he
was
beginning
to
have
no
longer
the
same
wish
.
  
<EOS>
The
unpersuadable
point
,
which
he
did
not
mention
,
Emma
guessed
to
be
good
behaviour
to
his
father
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
made
a
most
wretched
discovery
,
"
said
he
,
after
a
short
pause
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
here
a
week
to
-
morrow
 
half
my
time
.
<EOS>
I
never
knew
days
fly
so
fast
.
<EOS>
A
week
to
-
morrow
!
 
<EOS>
And
I
have
hardly
begun
to
enjoy
myself
.
<EOS>
But
just
got
acquainted
with
Mrs.
Weston
,
and
others
!
 
<EOS>
I
hate
the
recollection
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
you
may
now
begin
to
regret
that
you
spent
one
whole
day
,
out
of
so
few
,
in
having
your
hair
cut
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
he
,
smiling
,
"
that
is
no
subject
of
regret
at
all
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
pleasure
in
seeing
my
friends
,
unless
I
can
believe
myself
fit
to
be
seen
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
rest
of
the
gentlemen
being
now
in
the
room
<EOS>
,
Emma
found
herself
obliged
to
turn
from
him
for
a
few
minutes
,
and
listen
to
Mr.
Cole
.
<EOS>
When
Mr.
Cole
had
moved
away
,
and
her
attention
could
be
restored
as
before
,
she
saw
Frank
Churchill
looking
intently
across
the
room
at
Miss
Fairfax
,
who
was
sitting
exactly
opposite
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
the
matter
?
"
said
she
.
  
<EOS>
He
started
.
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
for
rousing
me
,
"
he
replied
.
<EOS>
"
I
believe
I
have
been
very
rude
;
but
really
Miss
Fairfax
has
done
her
hair
in
so
odd
a
way
 
<EOS>
so
very
odd
a
way
 
<EOS>
that
I
can
not
keep
my
eyes
from
her
.
<EOS>
I
never
saw
any
thing
<EOS>
so
outree
!
 
<EOS>
Those
curls
!
 
<EOS>
This
must
be
a
fancy
of
her
own
.
<EOS>
I
see
nobody
else
looking
like
her
!
 
<EOS>
I
must
go
and
ask
her
whether
it
is
an
Irish
fashion
.
<EOS>
Shall
I
?
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
I
will
 
<EOS>
I
declare
I
will
 
<EOS>
and
you
shall
see
how
she
takes
it
;
 
whether
she
colours
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
was
gone
immediately
;
and
Emma
soon
saw
him
standing
before
Miss
Fairfax
,
and
talking
to
her
;
but
as
to
its
effect
on
the
young
lady
,
as
he
had
improvidently
placed
himself
exactly
between
them
,
exactly
in
front
of
Miss
Fairfax
,
she
could
absolutely
distinguish
nothing
.
  
<EOS>
Before
he
could
return
to
his
chair
,
it
was
taken
by
Mrs.
Weston
.
  
<EOS>
"
This
is
the
luxury
of
a
large
party
,
"
said
she
:
 
"
one
can
get
near
every
body
,
and
say
every
thing
.
<EOS>
My
dear
Emma
,
I
am
longing
to
talk
to
you
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
making
discoveries
and
forming
plans
,
just
like
yourself
,
and
I
must
tell
them
while
the
idea
is
fresh
.
<EOS>
Do
you
know
how
Miss
Bates
and
her
niece
came
here
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
?
 
<EOS>
They
were
invited
,
were
not
they
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
<EOS>
yes
 
<EOS>
but
how
they
were
conveyed
hither
?
 
<EOS>
the
manner
of
their
coming
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
walked
,
I
conclude
.
<EOS>
How
else
could
they
come
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
true
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
a
little
while
ago
it
occurred
to
me
how
very
sad
it
would
be
to
have
Jane
Fairfax
walking
home
again
,
late
at
night
,
and
cold
as
the
nights
are
now
.
<EOS>
And
as
I
looked
at
her
,
though
I
never
saw
her
appear
to
more
advantage
,
it
struck
me
that
she
was
heated
,
and
would
therefore
be
particularly
liable
to
take
cold
.
<EOS>
Poor
girl
!
<EOS>
I
could
not
bear
the
idea
of
it
;
so
,
as
soon
as
Mr.
Weston
came
into
the
room
,
and
I
could
get
at
him
,
I
spoke
to
him
about
the
carriage
.
<EOS>
You
may
guess
how
readily
he
came
into
my
wishes
;
and
having
his
approbation
,
I
made
my
way
directly
to
Miss
Bates
,
to
assure
her
that
the
carriage
would
be
at
her
service
before
it
took
us
home
;
for
I
thought
it
would
be
making
her
comfortable
at
once
.
<EOS>
Good
soul
!
<EOS>
she
was
as
grateful
as
possible
,
you
may
be
sure
.
<EOS>
"
Nobody
was
ever
so
fortunate
as
herself
!
"
 
<EOS>
but
with
many
,
many
thanks
 
"
there
was
no
occasion
to
trouble
us
,
for
Mr.
Knightley
's
carriage
had
brought
,
and
was
to
take
them
home
again
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
quite
surprized
;
 
very
glad
,
I
am
sure
;
but
really
quite
surprized
.
<EOS>
Such
a
very
kind
attention
 
and
so
thoughtful
an
attention
!
 
<EOS>
the
sort
of
thing
that
so
few
men
would
think
of
.
<EOS>
And
,
in
short
,
from
knowing
his
usual
ways
,
I
am
very
much
inclined
to
think
that
it
was
for
their
accommodation
<EOS>
the
carriage
was
used
at
all
.
<EOS>
I
do
suspect
he
would
not
have
had
a
pair
of
horses
for
himself
,
and
that
it
was
only
as
an
excuse
for
assisting
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
likely
,
"
said
Emma
 
"
nothing
more
likely
.
<EOS>
I
know
no
man
more
likely
than
Mr.
Knightley
to
do
the
sort
of
thing
 
to
do
any
thing
really
good
-
natured
,
useful
,
considerate
,
or
benevolent
.
<EOS>
He
is
not
a
gallant
man
,
but
he
is
a
very
humane
one
;
and
this
,
considering
Jane
Fairfax
's
ill
-
health
,
would
appear
a
case
of
humanity
to
him
;
 
and
for
an
act
of
unostentatious
kindness
,
there
is
nobody
whom
I
would
fix
on
more
than
on
Mr.
Knightley
.
<EOS>
I
know
he
had
horses
to
-
day
 
for
we
arrived
together
;
and
I
laughed
at
him
about
it
,
but
he
said
not
a
word
that
could
betray
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
said
Mrs.
Weston
,
smiling
,
"
you
give
him
credit
for
more
simple
,
disinterested
benevolence
in
this
instance
than
I
do
;
for
while
Miss
Bates
was
speaking
,
a
suspicion
darted
into
my
head
,
and
I
have
never
been
able
to
get
it
out
again
.
<EOS>
The
more
I
think
of
it
,
the
more
probable
it
appears
.
<EOS>
In
short
,
I
have
made
a
match
between
Mr.
Knightley
and
Jane
Fairfax
.
<EOS>
See
the
consequence
of
keeping
you
company
!
 
<EOS>
What
do
you
say
to
it
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Knightley
and
Jane
Fairfax
!
"
exclaimed
Emma
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Dear
Mrs.
Weston
,
how
could
you
think
of
such
a
thing
?
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Knightley
!
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Knightley
must
not
marry
!
 
<EOS>
You
would
not
have
little
Henry
cut
out
from
Donwell
?
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
no
,
no
,
Henry
must
have
Donwell
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
at
all
consent
to
Mr.
Knightley
's
marrying
;
and
I
am
sure
it
is
not
at
all
likely
.
<EOS>
I
am
amazed
that
you
should
think
of
such
a
thing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Emma
,
I
have
told
you
what
led
me
to
think
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
want
the
match
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
want
to
injure
dear
little
Henry
 
<EOS>
but
the
idea
has
been
given
me
by
circumstances
;
and
if
Mr.
Knightley
really
wished
to
marry
,
you
would
not
have
him
refrain
on
Henry
's
account
,
a
boy
of
six
years
old
,
who
knows
nothing
of
the
matter
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
would
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
bear
to
have
Henry
supplanted
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Knightley
marry
!
 
<EOS>
No
,
I
have
never
had
such
an
idea
,
and
I
can
not
adopt
it
now
.
<EOS>
And
Jane
Fairfax
,
too
,
of
all
women
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
she
has
always
been
a
first
favourite
with
him
,
as
you
very
well
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
But
the
imprudence
of
such
a
match
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
speaking
of
its
prudence
;
merely
its
probability
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
see
no
probability
in
it
,
unless
you
have
any
better
foundation
than
what
you
mention
.
<EOS>
His
good
-
nature
,
his
humanity
,
as
I
tell
you
,
would
be
quite
enough
to
account
for
the
horses
.
<EOS>
He
has
a
great
regard
for
the
Bateses
,
you
know
,
independent
of
Jane
Fairfax
 
and
is
always
glad
to
shew
them
attention
.
<EOS>
My
dear
Mrs.
Weston
,
do
not
take
to
match
-
making
.
<EOS>
You
do
it
very
ill
.
<EOS>
Jane
Fairfax
mistress
of
the
Abbey
!
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
no
,
no
;
 
<EOS>
every
feeling
revolts
.
<EOS>
For
his
own
sake
,
I
would
not
have
him
do
so
mad
a
thing
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Imprudent
,
if
you
please
 
but
not
mad
.
<EOS>
Excepting
inequality
of
fortune
,
and
perhaps
a
little
disparity
of
age
,
I
can
see
nothing
unsuitable
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
Mr.
Knightley
does
not
want
to
marry
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
he
has
not
the
least
idea
of
it
.
<EOS>
Do
not
put
it
into
his
head
.
<EOS>
Why
should
he
marry
?
 
<EOS>
He
is
as
happy
as
possible
by
himself
;
with
his
farm
,
and
his
sheep
,
and
his
library
,
and
all
the
parish
to
manage
;
and
he
is
extremely
fond
of
his
brother
's
children
.
<EOS>
He
has
no
occasion
to
marry
,
either
to
fill
up
his
time
or
his
heart
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Emma
,
as
long
as
he
thinks
so
,
it
is
so
;
but
if
he
really
loves
Jane
Fairfax
 
"
  
"
Nonsense
!
<EOS>
He
does
not
care
about
Jane
Fairfax
.
<EOS>
In
the
way
of
love
,
I
am
sure
he
does
not
.
<EOS>
He
would
do
any
good
to
her
,
or
her
family
;
but
 
"
  
"
Well
,
"
said
Mrs.
Weston
,
laughing
,
"
perhaps
the
greatest
good
he
could
do
them
,
would
be
to
give
Jane
such
a
respectable
home
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
it
would
be
good
to
her
,
I
am
sure
it
would
be
evil
to
himself
;
a
very
shameful
and
degrading
connexion
.
<EOS>
How
would
he
bear
to
have
Miss
Bates
belonging
to
him
?
 
<EOS>
To
have
her
haunting
the
Abbey
,
and
thanking
him
all
day
long
for
his
great
kindness
in
marrying
Jane
?
 
<EOS>
"
So
very
kind
and
obliging
!
 
<EOS>
But
he
always
had
been
such
a
very
kind
neighbour
!
"
<EOS>
And
then
fly
off
,
through
half
a
sentence
,
to
her
mother
's
old
petticoat
.
<EOS>
"
Not
that
it
was
such
a
very
old
petticoat
either
 
for
still
it
would
last
<EOS>
a
great
while
 
<EOS>
and
,
indeed
,
she
must
thankfully
say
that
their
petticoats
were
all
very
strong
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
"
For
shame
,
Emma
!
Do
not
mimic
her
.
<EOS>
You
divert
me
against
my
conscience
.
<EOS>
And
,
upon
my
word
,
I
do
not
think
Mr.
Knightley
would
be
much
disturbed
by
Miss
Bates
.
<EOS>
Little
things
do
not
irritate
him
.
<EOS>
She
might
talk
on
;
and
if
he
wanted
to
say
any
thing
himself
,
he
would
only
talk
louder
,
and
drown
her
voice
.
<EOS>
But
the
question
is
not
,
whether
it
would
be
a
bad
connexion
for
him
,
but
whether
he
wishes
it
;
and
I
think
he
does
.
<EOS>
I
have
heard
him
speak
,
and
so
must
you
,
so
very
highly
of
Jane
Fairfax
!
<EOS>
The
interest
he
takes
in
her
 
his
anxiety
about
her
health
 
<EOS>
his
concern
that
she
should
have
no
happier
prospect
!
<EOS>
I
have
heard
him
express
himself
so
warmly
on
those
points
!
 
<EOS>
Such
an
admirer
of
her
performance
on
the
pianoforte
,
and
of
her
voice
!
<EOS>
I
have
heard
him
say
that
he
could
listen
to
her
for
ever
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
and
I
had
almost
forgotten
one
idea
that
occurred
to
me
 
this
pianoforte
that
has
been
sent
here
by
somebody
 
though
we
have
all
been
so
well
satisfied
to
consider
it
a
present
from
the
Campbells
<EOS>
,
may
it
not
be
from
Mr.
Knightley
?
<EOS>
I
can
not
help
suspecting
him
.
<EOS>
I
think
he
is
just
the
person
to
do
it
,
even
without
being
in
love
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
it
can
be
no
argument
to
prove
that
he
is
in
love
.
<EOS>
But
I
do
not
think
it
is
at
all
a
likely
thing
for
him
to
do
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Knightley
does
nothing
mysteriously
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
heard
him
lamenting
her
having
no
instrument
repeatedly
;
oftener
than
I
should
suppose
such
a
circumstance
would
,
in
the
common
course
of
things
,
occur
to
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
well
;
and
if
he
had
intended
to
give
her
one
,
he
would
have
told
her
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
might
be
scruples
of
delicacy
,
my
dear
Emma
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
very
strong
notion
that
it
comes
from
him
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
he
was
particularly
silent
when
Mrs.
Cole
told
us
of
it
at
dinner
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
take
up
an
idea
,
Mrs.
Weston
,
and
run
away
with
it
;
as
you
have
many
a
time
reproached
me
with
doing
.
<EOS>
I
see
no
sign
of
attachment
 
<EOS>
I
believe
nothing
of
the
pianoforte
 
and
proof
only
shall
convince
me
that
Mr.
Knightley
has
any
thought
of
marrying
Jane
Fairfax
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
They
combated
the
point
some
time
longer
in
the
same
way
;
Emma
rather
gaining
ground
over
the
mind
of
her
friend
;
for
Mrs.
Weston
was
the
most
used
of
the
two
to
yield
;
till
a
little
bustle
in
the
room
shewed
them
that
tea
was
over
,
and
the
instrument
in
preparation
;
 
and
at
the
same
moment
Mr.
Cole
approaching
to
entreat
Miss
Woodhouse
would
do
them
the
honour
of
trying
it
.
<EOS>
Frank
Churchill
,
of
whom
,
in
the
eagerness
of
her
conversation
with
Mrs.
Weston
,
she
had
been
seeing
nothing
,
except
that
he
had
found
a
seat
by
Miss
Fairfax
,
followed
Mr.
Cole
,
to
add
his
very
pressing
entreaties
;
and
as
,
in
every
respect
,
it
suited
Emma
best
to
lead
,
she
gave
a
very
proper
compliance
.
  
<EOS>
She
knew
the
limitations
of
her
own
powers
too
well
to
attempt
more
than
she
could
perform
with
credit
;
she
wanted
neither
taste
nor
spirit
in
the
little
things
which
are
generally
acceptable
,
and
could
accompany
her
own
voice
well
.
<EOS>
One
accompaniment
to
her
song
took
her
agreeably
by
surprize
 
a
second
,
slightly
but
correctly
taken
by
Frank
Churchill
.
<EOS>
Her
pardon
was
duly
begged
at
the
close
of
the
song
,
and
every
thing
usual
followed
.
<EOS>
He
was
accused
of
having
a
delightful
voice
,
and
a
perfect
knowledge
of
music
;
which
was
properly
denied
;
and
that
he
knew
nothing
of
the
matter
,
and
had
no
voice
at
all
,
roundly
asserted
.
<EOS>
They
sang
together
once
more
;
and
Emma
would
then
resign
her
place
to
Miss
Fairfax
,
whose
performance
,
both
vocal
and
instrumental
,
she
never
could
attempt
to
conceal
from
herself
,
was
infinitely
superior
to
her
own
.
  
<EOS>
With
mixed
feelings
,
she
seated
herself
at
a
little
distance
from
the
numbers
round
the
instrument
,
to
listen
.
<EOS>
Frank
Churchill
sang
again
.
<EOS>
They
had
sung
together
once
or
twice
,
it
appeared
,
at
Weymouth
.
<EOS>
But
the
sight
of
Mr.
Knightley
among
the
most
attentive
,
soon
drew
away
half
Emma
's
mind
;
and
she
fell
into
a
train
of
thinking
on
the
subject
of
Mrs.
Weston
's
suspicions
,
to
which
the
sweet
sounds
of
the
united
voices
gave
only
momentary
interruptions
.
<EOS>
Her
objections
to
Mr.
Knightley
's
marrying
did
not
in
the
least
subside
.
<EOS>
She
could
see
nothing
but
evil
in
it
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
a
great
disappointment
to
Mr.
John
Knightley
;
consequently
to
Isabella
.
<EOS>
A
real
injury
to
the
children
 
a
most
mortifying
change
,
and
material
loss
to
them
all
;
 
a
very
great
deduction
from
her
father
's
daily
comfort
 
and
,
as
to
herself
,
she
could
not
at
all
endure
the
idea
of
Jane
Fairfax
at
Donwell
Abbey
.
<EOS>
A
Mrs.
Knightley
for
them
all
to
give
way
to
!
 
<EOS>
No
 
Mr.
Knightley
must
never
marry
.
<EOS>
Little
Henry
must
remain
the
heir
of
Donwell
.
  
<EOS>
Presently
Mr.
Knightley
looked
back
,
and
came
and
sat
down
by
her
.
<EOS>
They
talked
at
first
only
of
the
performance
.
<EOS>
His
admiration
was
certainly
very
warm
;
yet
she
thought
,
but
for
Mrs.
Weston
,
it
would
not
have
struck
her
.
<EOS>
As
a
sort
of
touchstone
,
however
,
she
began
to
speak
of
his
kindness
in
conveying
the
aunt
and
niece
;
and
though
his
answer
was
in
the
spirit
of
cutting
the
matter
short
,
she
believed
it
to
indicate
only
his
disinclination
to
dwell
on
any
kindness
of
his
own
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
often
feel
concern
,
"
said
she
,
"
that
I
dare
not
make
our
carriage
more
useful
on
such
occasions
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
that
I
am
without
the
wish
;
but
you
know
how
impossible
my
father
would
deem
it
that
James
should
put
-
to
for
such
a
purpose
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Quite
out
of
the
question
,
quite
out
of
the
question
,
"
he
replied
;
 
"
but
you
must
often
wish
it
,
I
am
sure
.
"
<EOS>
And
he
smiled
with
such
seeming
pleasure
at
the
conviction
,
that
she
must
proceed
another
step
.
  
<EOS>
"
This
present
from
the
Campbells
,
"
said
she
 
<EOS>
"
this
pianoforte
is
very
kindly
given
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
he
replied
,
and
without
the
smallest
apparent
embarrassment
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
they
would
have
done
better
<EOS>
had
they
given
her
notice
of
it
.
<EOS>
Surprizes
are
foolish
things
.
<EOS>
The
pleasure
is
not
enhanced
,
and
the
inconvenience
is
often
considerable
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
expected
better
judgment
in
Colonel
Campbell
.
"
  
<EOS>
From
that
moment
,
Emma
could
have
taken
her
oath
that
Mr.
Knightley
had
had
no
concern
in
giving
the
instrument
.
<EOS>
But
whether
he
were
entirely
free
from
peculiar
attachment
 
whether
there
were
no
actual
preference
 
remained
a
little
longer
doubtful
.
<EOS>
Towards
the
end
of
Jane
's
second
song
,
her
voice
grew
thick
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
will
do
,
"
said
he
,
when
it
was
finished
,
thinking
aloud
 
"
you
have
sung
quite
enough
for
one
evening
 
now
be
quiet
.
"
  
<EOS>
Another
song
,
however
,
was
soon
begged
for
.
"
<EOS>
One
more
;
 
they
would
not
fatigue
Miss
Fairfax
on
any
account
,
and
would
only
ask
for
one
more
.
"
<EOS>
And
Frank
Churchill
was
heard
to
say
,
"
I
think
you
could
manage
this
without
effort
;
the
first
part
is
so
very
trifling
.
<EOS>
The
strength
of
the
song
falls
on
the
second
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Knightley
grew
angry
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
fellow
,
"
said
he
,
indignantly
,
"
thinks
of
nothing
but
shewing
off
his
own
voice
.
<EOS>
This
must
not
be
.
"
<EOS>
And
touching
Miss
Bates
,
who
at
that
moment
passed
near
 
"
Miss
Bates
,
are
you
mad
,
to
let
your
niece
sing
herself
hoarse
in
this
manner
?
<EOS>
Go
,
and
interfere
.
<EOS>
They
have
no
mercy
on
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Bates
,
in
her
real
anxiety
for
Jane
,
could
hardly
stay
even
to
be
grateful
,
before
she
stept
forward
and
put
an
end
to
all
farther
singing
.
<EOS>
Here
ceased
the
concert
part
of
the
evening
,
for
Miss
Woodhouse
and
Miss
Fairfax
were
the
only
young
lady
performers
;
but
soon
(
within
five
minutes
)
<EOS>
the
proposal
of
dancing
 
originating
nobody
exactly
knew
where
 
was
so
effectually
promoted
by
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Cole
,
that
every
thing
was
rapidly
clearing
away
,
to
give
proper
space
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Weston
,
capital
in
her
country
-
dances
,
was
seated
,
and
beginning
an
irresistible
waltz
;
and
Frank
Churchill
,
coming
up
with
most
becoming
gallantry
to
Emma
,
had
secured
her
hand
,
and
led
her
up
to
the
top
.
  
<EOS>
While
waiting
till
the
other
young
people
could
pair
themselves
off
,
Emma
found
time
,
in
spite
of
the
compliments
she
was
receiving
on
her
voice
and
her
taste
,
to
look
about
,
and
see
what
became
of
Mr.
Knightley
.
<EOS>
This
would
be
a
trial
.
<EOS>
He
was
no
dancer
in
general
.
<EOS>
If
he
were
to
be
very
alert
in
engaging
Jane
Fairfax
now
,
it
might
augur
something
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
immediate
appearance
.
<EOS>
No
;
he
was
talking
to
Mrs.
Cole
 
<EOS>
he
was
looking
on
unconcerned
;
Jane
was
asked
by
somebody
else
,
and
he
was
still
talking
to
Mrs.
Cole
.
  
<EOS>
Emma
had
no
longer
an
alarm
for
Henry
;
his
interest
was
yet
safe
;
and
she
led
off
the
dance
with
genuine
spirit
and
enjoyment
.
<EOS>
Not
more
than
five
couple
could
be
mustered
;
but
the
rarity
and
the
suddenness
of
it
made
it
very
delightful
,
and
she
found
herself
well
matched
in
a
partner
.
<EOS>
They
were
a
couple
worth
looking
at
.
  
<EOS>
Two
dances
,
unfortunately
,
were
all
that
could
be
allowed
.
<EOS>
It
was
growing
late
,
and
Miss
Bates
became
anxious
to
get
home
,
on
her
mother
's
account
.
<EOS>
After
some
attempts
,
therefore
,
to
be
permitted
to
begin
again
,
they
were
obliged
to
thank
Mrs.
Weston
,
look
sorrowful
,
and
have
done
.
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
it
is
as
well
,
"
said
Frank
Churchill
,
as
he
attended
Emma
to
her
carriage
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
have
asked
Miss
Fairfax
,
and
her
languid
dancing
would
not
have
agreed
with
me
,
after
yours
.
"
    
<EOS>
Emma
did
not
repent
her
condescension
in
going
to
the
Coles
.
<EOS>
The
visit
afforded
her
many
pleasant
recollections
the
next
day
;
and
all
that
she
might
be
supposed
to
have
lost
on
the
side
of
dignified
seclusion
,
must
be
amply
repaid
in
the
splendour
of
popularity
.
<EOS>
She
must
have
delighted
the
Coles
 
worthy
people
,
who
deserved
to
be
made
happy
!
 
<EOS>
And
left
a
name
behind
her
that
would
not
soon
die
away
.
  
<EOS>
Perfect
happiness
,
even
in
memory
,
is
not
common
;
and
there
were
two
points
on
which
she
was
not
quite
easy
.
<EOS>
She
doubted
whether
she
had
not
transgressed
the
duty
of
woman
by
woman
,
in
betraying
her
suspicions
of
Jane
Fairfax
's
feelings
to
Frank
Churchill
.
<EOS>
It
was
hardly
right
;
but
it
had
been
so
strong
an
idea
,
that
it
would
escape
her
,
and
his
submission
to
all
that
she
told
,
was
a
compliment
to
her
penetration
,
which
made
it
difficult
for
her
to
be
quite
certain
that
she
ought
to
have
held
her
tongue
.
  
<EOS>
The
other
circumstance
of
regret
related
also
to
Jane
Fairfax
;
and
there
she
had
no
doubt
.
<EOS>
She
did
unfeignedly
and
unequivocally
regret
the
inferiority
of
her
own
playing
and
singing
.
<EOS>
She
did
most
heartily
grieve
over
the
idleness
of
her
childhood
 
and
sat
down
and
practised
vigorously
an
hour
and
a
half
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
then
interrupted
by
Harriet
's
coming
in
;
and
if
Harriet
's
praise
could
have
satisfied
her
,
she
might
soon
have
been
comforted
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
if
I
could
but
play
as
well
as
you
and
Miss
Fairfax
!
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
n't
class
us
together
,
Harriet
.
<EOS>
My
playing
is
no
more
like
her
's
,
than
a
lamp
is
like
sunshine
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
dear
 
<EOS>
I
think
you
play
the
best
of
the
two
.
<EOS>
I
think
you
play
quite
as
well
as
she
does
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
I
had
much
rather
hear
you
.
<EOS>
Every
body
last
night
said
how
well
you
played
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Those
who
knew
any
thing
about
it
,
must
have
felt
the
difference
.
<EOS>
The
truth
is
,
Harriet
,
that
my
playing
is
just
good
enough
to
be
praised
,
but
Jane
Fairfax
's
is
much
beyond
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
always
shall
think
that
you
play
quite
as
well
as
she
does
,
or
that
if
there
is
any
difference
nobody
would
ever
find
it
out
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Cole
said
how
much
taste
you
had
;
and
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
talked
a
great
deal
about
your
taste
,
and
that
he
valued
taste
much
more
than
execution
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
but
Jane
Fairfax
has
them
both
,
Harriet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
sure
?
<EOS>
I
saw
she
had
execution
,
but
I
did
not
know
she
had
any
taste
.
<EOS>
Nobody
talked
about
it
.
<EOS>
And
I
hate
Italian
singing
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
no
understanding
a
word
of
it
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
if
she
does
play
so
very
well
,
you
know
,
it
is
no
more
than
she
is
obliged
to
do
,
because
she
will
have
to
teach
.
<EOS>
The
Coxes
were
wondering
last
night
whether
she
would
get
into
any
great
family
.
<EOS>
How
did
you
think
the
Coxes
looked
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Just
as
they
always
do
 
very
vulgar
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
told
me
something
,
"
said
Harriet
rather
hesitatingly
;
"
but
it
is
nothing
of
any
consequence
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
was
obliged
to
ask
what
they
had
told
her
,
though
fearful
of
its
producing
Mr.
Elton
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
told
me
 
that
Mr.
Martin
dined
with
them
last
Saturday
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
came
to
their
father
upon
some
business
,
and
he
asked
him
to
stay
to
dinner
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
talked
a
great
deal
about
him
,
especially
Anne
Cox
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
what
she
meant
,
but
she
asked
me
if
I
thought
I
should
go
and
stay
there
again
next
summer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
meant
to
be
impertinently
curious
,
just
as
such
an
Anne
Cox
should
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
said
he
was
very
agreeable
the
day
he
dined
there
.
<EOS>
He
sat
by
her
at
dinner
.
<EOS>
Miss
Nash
thinks
either
of
the
Coxes
would
be
very
glad
to
marry
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
likely
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
they
are
,
without
exception
,
the
most
vulgar
girls
in
Highbury
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Harriet
had
business
at
Ford
's
.
 
<EOS>
Emma
thought
it
most
prudent
to
go
with
her
.
<EOS>
Another
accidental
meeting
with
the
Martins
was
possible
,
and
in
her
present
state
,
would
be
dangerous
.
  
<EOS>
Harriet
,
tempted
by
every
thing
and
swayed
by
half
a
word
,
was
always
very
long
at
a
purchase
;
and
while
she
was
still
hanging
over
muslins
and
changing
her
mind
,
Emma
went
to
the
door
for
amusement
.
 
<EOS>
Much
could
not
be
hoped
from
the
traffic
of
even
the
busiest
part
of
Highbury
;
 
Mr.
Perry
walking
hastily
by
,
Mr.
William
Cox
letting
himself
in
at
the
office
-
door
,
Mr.
Cole
's
carriage
-
horses
returning
from
exercise
,
or
a
stray
letter
-
boy
on
an
obstinate
mule
,
were
the
liveliest
objects
she
could
presume
to
expect
;
and
when
her
eyes
fell
only
on
the
butcher
with
his
tray
,
a
tidy
old
woman
travelling
homewards
from
shop
with
her
full
basket
,
two
curs
quarrelling
over
a
dirty
bone
,
and
a
string
of
dawdling
children
round
the
baker
's
little
bow
-
window
eyeing
the
gingerbread
,
she
knew
she
had
no
reason
to
complain
,
and
was
amused
enough
;
quite
enough
still
to
stand
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
A
mind
lively
and
at
ease
,
can
do
with
seeing
nothing
,
and
can
see
nothing
that
does
not
answer
.
  
<EOS>
She
looked
down
the
Randalls
road
.
<EOS>
The
scene
enlarged
;
two
persons
appeared
;
Mrs.
Weston
and
her
son
-
in
-
law
;
they
were
walking
into
Highbury
;
 
to
Hartfield
of
course
.
<EOS>
They
were
stopping
,
however
,
in
the
first
place
at
Mrs.
Bates
's
;
whose
house
was
a
little
nearer
Randalls
than
Ford
's
;
and
had
all
but
knocked
,
when
Emma
caught
their
eye
.
 
<EOS>
Immediately
they
crossed
the
road
and
came
forward
to
her
;
and
the
agreeableness
of
yesterday
's
engagement
seemed
to
give
fresh
pleasure
to
the
present
meeting
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Weston
informed
her
that
she
was
going
to
call
on
the
Bateses
,
in
order
to
hear
the
new
instrument
.
  
<EOS>
"
For
my
companion
tells
me
,
"
said
she
,
"
that
I
absolutely
promised
Miss
Bates
last
night
,
that
I
would
come
this
morning
.
<EOS>
I
was
not
aware
of
it
myself
.
<EOS>
I
did
not
know
that
I
had
fixed
a
day
,
but
as
he
says
I
did
,
I
am
going
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
while
Mrs.
Weston
pays
her
visit
,
I
may
be
allowed
,
I
hope
,
"
said
Frank
Churchill
,
"
to
join
your
party
and
wait
for
her
at
Hartfield
 
if
you
are
going
home
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Weston
was
disappointed
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
thought
you
meant
to
go
with
me
.
<EOS>
They
would
be
very
much
pleased
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Me
!
<EOS>
I
should
be
quite
in
the
way
.
<EOS>
But
,
perhaps
 
I
may
be
equally
in
the
way
here
.
<EOS>
Miss
Woodhouse
looks
as
if
she
did
not
want
me
.
<EOS>
My
aunt
always
sends
me
off
when
she
is
shopping
.
<EOS>
She
says
I
fidget
her
to
death
;
and
Miss
Woodhouse
looks
as
if
she
could
almost
say
the
same
.
<EOS>
What
am
I
to
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
here
on
no
business
of
my
own
,
"
said
Emma
;
"
I
am
only
waiting
for
my
friend
.
<EOS>
She
will
probably
have
soon
done
,
and
then
we
shall
go
home
.
<EOS>
But
you
had
better
go
with
Mrs.
Weston
and
hear
the
instrument
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
 
if
you
advise
it
.
 
<EOS>
But
(
with
a
smile
)
if
Colonel
Campbell
should
have
employed
a
careless
friend
,
and
if
it
should
prove
to
have
an
indifferent
tone
 
<EOS>
what
shall
I
say
?
<EOS>
I
shall
be
no
support
to
Mrs.
Weston
.
<EOS>
She
might
do
very
well
by
herself
.
<EOS>
A
disagreeable
truth
would
be
palatable
through
her
lips
,
but
I
am
the
wretchedest
being
in
the
world
at
a
civil
falsehood
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
believe
any
such
thing
,
"
replied
Emma
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
persuaded
that
you
can
be
as
insincere
as
your
neighbours
,
when
it
is
necessary
;
but
there
is
no
reason
to
suppose
the
instrument
is
indifferent
.
<EOS>
Quite
otherwise
indeed
,
if
I
understood
Miss
Fairfax
's
opinion
last
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
come
with
me
,
"
said
Mrs.
Weston
,
"
if
it
be
not
very
disagreeable
to
you
.
<EOS>
It
need
not
detain
us
long
.
<EOS>
We
will
go
to
Hartfield
afterwards
.
<EOS>
We
will
follow
them
to
Hartfield
.
<EOS>
I
really
wish
you
to
call
with
me
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
felt
so
great
an
attention
!
<EOS>
and
I
always
thought
you
meant
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
could
say
no
more
;
and
with
the
hope
of
Hartfield
to
reward
him
,
returned
with
Mrs.
Weston
to
Mrs.
Bates
's
door
.
<EOS>
Emma
watched
them
in
,
and
then
joined
Harriet
at
the
interesting
counter
,
 
trying
,
with
all
the
force
of
her
own
mind
,
to
convince
her
that
if
she
wanted
plain
muslin
it
was
of
no
use
to
look
at
figured
;
and
that
a
blue
ribbon
,
be
it
ever
so
beautiful
,
would
still
never
match
her
yellow
pattern
.
<EOS>
At
last
it
was
all
settled
,
even
to
the
destination
of
the
parcel
.
  
<EOS>
"
Should
I
send
it
to
Mrs.
Goddard
's
,
ma'am
?
"
asked
Mrs.
Ford
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
 
<EOS>
no
 
<EOS>
yes
,
to
Mrs.
Goddard
's
.
<EOS>
Only
my
pattern
gown
is
at
Hartfield
.
<EOS>
No
,
you
shall
send
it
to
Hartfield
,
if
you
please
.
<EOS>
But
then
,
Mrs.
Goddard
will
want
to
see
it
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
could
take
the
pattern
gown
home
any
day
.
<EOS>
But
I
shall
want
the
ribbon
directly
 
<EOS>
so
it
had
better
go
to
Hartfield
 
at
least
the
ribbon
.
<EOS>
You
could
make
it
into
two
parcels
,
Mrs.
Ford
,
could
not
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
worth
<EOS>
while
,
Harriet
,
to
give
Mrs.
Ford
the
trouble
of
two
parcels
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
more
it
is
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
trouble
in
the
world
,
ma'am
,
"
said
the
obliging
Mrs.
Ford
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
but
indeed
I
would
much
rather
have
it
only
in
one
.
<EOS>
Then
,
if
you
please
,
you
shall
send
it
all
to
Mrs.
Goddard
's
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
 
<EOS>
No
<EOS>
,
I
think
,
Miss
Woodhouse
,
I
may
just
as
well
have
it
sent
to
Hartfield
,
and
take
it
home
with
me
at
night
.
<EOS>
What
do
you
advise
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
you
do
not
give
another
half
-
second
to
the
subject
.
<EOS>
To
Hartfield
,
if
you
please
,
Mrs.
Ford
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
that
will
be
much
best
,
"
said
Harriet
,
quite
satisfied
,
"
I
should
not
at
all
like
to
have
it
sent
to
Mrs.
Goddard
's
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Voices
approached
the
shop
 
or
rather
one
voice
and
two
ladies
:
Mrs.
Weston
and
Miss
Bates
met
them
at
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Miss
Woodhouse
,
"
said
the
latter
,
"
I
am
just
run
across
to
entreat
the
favour
of
you
to
come
and
sit
down
with
us
a
little
while
,
and
give
us
your
opinion
of
our
new
instrument
;
you
and
Miss
Smith
.
<EOS>
How
do
you
do
,
Miss
Smith
?
 
<EOS>
Very
well
I
thank
you
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
begged
Mrs.
Weston
to
come
with
me
,
that
I
might
be
sure
of
succeeding
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
Mrs.
Bates
and
Miss
Fairfax
are
 
"
  
"
Very
well
,
I
am
much
obliged
to
you
.
<EOS>
My
mother
is
delightfully
well
;
and
Jane
caught
no
cold
last
night
.
<EOS>
How
is
Mr.
Woodhouse
?
 
<EOS>
I
am
so
glad
to
hear
such
a
good
account
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Weston
told
me
you
were
here
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
then
,
said
I
,
<EOS>
I
must
run
across
<EOS>
,
I
am
sure
Miss
Woodhouse
will
allow
me
just
to
run
across
and
entreat
her
to
come
in
;
my
mother
will
be
so
very
happy
to
see
her
 
<EOS>
and
now
we
are
such
a
nice
party
,
she
can
not
refuse
.
 
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
pray
do
,
"
said
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
,
"
Miss
Woodhouse
's
opinion
of
the
instrument
will
be
worth
having
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
But
,
said
I
,
I
shall
be
more
sure
of
succeeding
if
one
of
you
will
go
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
"
said
he
,
"
wait
half
a
minute
,
till
I
have
finished
my
job
;
"
 
For
,
<EOS>
would
you
believe
it
,
Miss
Woodhouse
,
there
he
is
,
in
the
most
obliging
manner
in
the
world
,
fastening
in
the
rivet
of
my
mother
's
spectacles
.
 
<EOS>
The
rivet
came
out
,
you
know
,
this
morning
.
 
<EOS>
So
very
obliging
!
 
<EOS>
For
my
mother
had
no
use
of
her
spectacles
 
could
not
put
them
on
.
<EOS>
And
,
by
the
bye
,
every
body
ought
to
have
two
pair
of
spectacles
;
they
should
indeed
.
<EOS>
Jane
said
so
.
<EOS>
I
meant
to
take
them
over
to
John
Saunders
the
first
thing
I
did
,
but
something
or
other
hindered
me
all
the
morning
;
first
one
thing
,
then
another
<EOS>
,
there
is
no
saying
what
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
At
one
time
Patty
came
to
say
she
thought
the
kitchen
chimney
wanted
sweeping
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
said
I
,
Patty
do
not
come
with
your
bad
news
to
me
.
<EOS>
Here
is
the
rivet
of
your
mistress
's
spectacles
out
.
<EOS>
Then
the
baked
apples
came
home
,
Mrs.
Wallis
sent
them
by
her
boy
;
they
are
extremely
civil
and
obliging
to
us
,
the
Wallises
,
always
 
I
have
heard
some
people
say
that
Mrs.
Wallis
can
be
uncivil
and
give
a
very
rude
answer
,
but
we
have
never
known
any
thing
but
the
greatest
attention
from
them
.
<EOS>
And
it
can
not
be
for
the
value
of
our
custom
now
,
for
what
is
our
consumption
of
bread
,
you
know
?
<EOS>
Only
three
of
us
.
 
<EOS>
besides
dear
Jane
at
present
 
<EOS>
and
she
really
eats
nothing
 
makes
such
a
shocking
breakfast
<EOS>
,
you
would
be
quite
frightened
if
you
saw
it
.
<EOS>
I
dare
not
let
my
mother
know
how
little
she
eats
 
<EOS>
so
I
say
one
thing
<EOS>
and
then
I
say
another
,
and
it
passes
off
.
<EOS>
But
about
the
middle
of
the
day
she
gets
hungry
,
and
there
is
nothing
she
likes
so
well
as
these
baked
apples
,
and
they
are
extremely
wholesome
,
for
I
took
the
opportunity
the
other
day
of
asking
Mr.
Perry
;
I
happened
to
meet
him
in
the
street
.
<EOS>
Not
that
I
had
any
doubt
before
 
I
have
so
often
heard
Mr.
Woodhouse
recommend
a
baked
apple
.
<EOS>
I
believe
it
is
the
only
way
that
Mr.
Woodhouse
thinks
the
fruit
thoroughly
wholesome
.
<EOS>
We
have
apple
-
dumplings
,
however
,
very
often
.
<EOS>
Patty
makes
an
excellent
apple
-
dumpling
.
<EOS>
Well
,
Mrs.
Weston
,
you
have
prevailed
,
I
hope
,
and
these
ladies
will
oblige
us
.
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
would
be
"
very
happy
to
wait
on
Mrs.
Bates
,
&
c.
,
"
and
they
did
at
last
move
out
of
the
shop
,
with
no
farther
delay
from
Miss
Bates
than
,
  
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
do
,
Mrs.
Ford
?
<EOS>
I
beg
your
pardon
.
<EOS>
I
did
not
see
you
before
.
<EOS>
I
hear
you
have
a
charming
collection
of
new
ribbons
from
town
.
<EOS>
Jane
came
back
delighted
yesterday
.
<EOS>
Thank
ye
,
the
gloves
do
very
well
 
only
a
little
too
large
about
the
wrist
;
but
Jane
is
taking
them
in
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
was
I
talking
of
?
"
said
she
,
beginning
again
when
they
were
all
in
the
street
.
  
<EOS>
Emma
wondered
on
what
,
of
all
the
medley
,
she
would
fix
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
declare
I
can
not
recollect
what
I
was
talking
of
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
my
mother
's
spectacles
.
<EOS>
So
very
obliging
of
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
"
said
he
,
"
I
do
think
I
can
fasten
the
rivet
;
I
like
a
job
of
this
kind
excessively
.
"
 
<EOS>
Which
you
know
shewed
him
to
be
so
very
....
<EOS>
Indeed
I
must
say
that
,
much
as
I
had
heard
of
him
before
and
much
as
I
had
expected
,
he
very
far
exceeds
any
thing
....
<EOS>
I
do
congratulate
you
,
Mrs.
Weston
,
most
warmly
.
<EOS>
He
seems
every
thing
the
fondest
parent
could
....
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
"
said
he
,
"
I
can
fasten
the
rivet
.
<EOS>
I
like
a
job
of
that
sort
excessively
.
<EOS>
"
I
never
shall
forget
his
manner
.
<EOS>
And
when
I
brought
out
the
baked
apples
from
the
closet
,
and
hoped
our
friends
would
be
so
very
obliging
as
to
take
some
,
"
Oh
!
"
said
he
directly
,
"
there
is
nothing
in
the
way
of
fruit
half
so
good
,
and
these
are
the
finest
-
looking
home
-
baked
apples
I
ever
saw
in
my
life
.
<EOS>
"
That
,
you
know
,
was
so
very
....
<EOS>
And
I
am
sure
,
by
his
manner
,
it
was
no
compliment
.
<EOS>
Indeed
they
are
very
delightful
apples
,
and
Mrs.
Wallis
does
them
full
justice
 
<EOS>
only
we
do
not
have
them
baked
more
than
twice
,
and
Mr.
Woodhouse
made
us
promise
to
have
them
done
<EOS>
three
times
 
but
Miss
Woodhouse
will
be
so
good
as
not
to
mention
it
.
<EOS>
The
apples
themselves
are
the
very
finest
sort
for
baking
,
beyond
a
doubt
;
all
from
Donwell
 
some
of
Mr.
Knightley
's
most
liberal
supply
.
<EOS>
He
sends
us
a
sack
every
year
;
and
certainly
there
never
was
such
a
keeping
apple
anywhere
as
one
of
his
trees
 
<EOS>
I
believe
there
is
two
of
them
.
<EOS>
My
mother
says
the
orchard
was
always
famous
in
her
younger
days
.
<EOS>
But
I
was
really
quite
shocked
the
other
day
 
for
Mr.
Knightley
called
one
morning
,
and
Jane
was
eating
these
apples
,
and
we
talked
about
them
and
said
how
much
she
enjoyed
them
,
and
he
asked
whether
we
were
not
got
to
the
end
of
our
stock
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
you
must
be
,
"
said
he
,
"
and
I
will
send
you
another
supply
;
for
I
have
a
great
many
more
than
I
can
ever
use
.
<EOS>
William
Larkins
let
me
keep
a
larger
quantity
than
usual
this
year
.
<EOS>
I
will
send
you
some
more
,
before
they
get
good
for
nothing
.
"
<EOS>
So
I
begged
he
would
not
 
for
really
as
to
ours
being
gone
<EOS>
,
I
could
not
absolutely
say
that
we
had
<EOS>
a
great
many
left
 
<EOS>
it
was
<EOS>
but
half
a
dozen
indeed
;
but
they
should
be
all
kept
for
Jane
;
and
I
could
not
at
all
bear
that
he
should
be
sending
us
more
,
so
liberal
as
he
had
been
already
;
and
Jane
said
the
same
.
<EOS>
And
when
he
was
gone
,
she
almost
quarrelled
with
me
 
<EOS>
No
,
I
should
not
say
quarrelled
,
for
we
never
had
a
quarrel
in
our
lives
;
but
she
was
quite
distressed
that
I
had
owned
the
apples
were
so
nearly
gone
;
she
wished
I
had
made
him
believe
we
had
a
great
many
left
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
said
I
,
my
dear
<EOS>
,
I
did
say
as
much
as
I
could
.
<EOS>
However
,
the
very
same
evening
William
Larkins
came
over
with
a
large
basket
of
apples
,
the
same
sort
of
apples
,
a
bushel
at
least
,
and
I
was
very
much
obliged
,
and
went
down
and
spoke
to
William
Larkins
and
said
every
thing
,
as
you
may
suppose
.
<EOS>
William
Larkins
is
such
an
old
acquaintance
!
<EOS>
I
am
always
glad
to
see
him
.
<EOS>
But
,
however
,
I
found
afterwards
from
Patty
,
that
William
said
it
was
all
the
apples
of
_
that
_
sort
<EOS>
his
master
had
;
he
had
brought
them
all
 
<EOS>
and
now
his
master
had
not
one
left
to
bake
or
boil
.
<EOS>
William
did
not
seem
to
mind
it
himself
,
he
was
so
pleased
to
think
his
master
had
sold
so
many
;
for
William
,
you
know
,
thinks
more
of
his
master
's
profit
than
any
thing
;
but
Mrs.
Hodges
,
he
said
,
was
quite
displeased
at
their
being
all
sent
away
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
bear
that
her
master
should
not
be
able
to
have
another
apple
-
tart
this
spring
.
<EOS>
He
told
Patty
this
,
but
bid
her
not
mind
it
,
and
be
sure
not
to
say
any
thing
to
us
about
it
,
for
Mrs.
Hodges
_
would
_
be
cross
sometimes
,
and
as
long
as
so
many
sacks
were
sold
,
it
did
not
signify
who
ate
the
remainder
.
<EOS>
And
so
Patty
told
me
,
and
<EOS>
I
was
excessively
shocked
indeed
!
<EOS>
I
would
not
have
Mr.
Knightley
know
any
thing
about
it
for
the
world
!
<EOS>
He
would
be
so
very
....
<EOS>
I
wanted
to
keep
it
from
Jane
's
knowledge
;
but
,
unluckily
,
I
had
mentioned
it
before
I
was
aware
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Bates
had
just
done
as
Patty
opened
the
door
;
and
her
visitors
walked
upstairs
without
having
any
regular
narration
to
attend
to
,
pursued
only
by
the
sounds
of
her
desultory
<EOS>
good
-
will
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pray
take
care
,
Mrs.
Weston
,
there
is
a
step
at
the
turning
.
<EOS>
Pray
take
care
,
<EOS>
Miss
Woodhouse
,
ours
is
rather
a
dark
staircase
 
rather
darker
and
narrower
than
one
could
wish
.
<EOS>
Miss
Smith
,
pray
take
care
.
<EOS>
Miss
Woodhouse
,
I
am
quite
concerned
,
I
am
sure
you
hit
your
foot
.
<EOS>
Miss
Smith
,
the
step
at
the
turning
.
"
    
<EOS>
The
appearance
of
the
little
sitting
-
room
as
they
entered
,
was
tranquillity
itself
;
Mrs.
Bates
,
deprived
of
her
usual
employment
,
slumbering
on
one
side
of
the
fire
,
Frank
Churchill
,
at
a
table
near
her
,
most
deedily
occupied
about
her
spectacles
,
and
Jane
Fairfax
,
standing
with
her
back
to
them
,
intent
on
her
pianoforte
.
  
<EOS>
Busy
as
he
was
,
however
,
the
young
man
was
yet
able
to
shew
a
most
happy
countenance
on
seeing
Emma
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
This
is
a
pleasure
,
"
said
he
,
in
rather
a
low
voice
,
"
coming
at
least
ten
minutes
earlier
than
I
had
calculated
.
<EOS>
You
find
me
trying
to
be
useful
;
tell
me
if
you
think
I
shall
succeed
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
!
"
said
Mrs.
Weston
,
"
have
not
you
finished
it
yet
?
<EOS>
you
would
not
earn
a
very
good
livelihood
as
a
working
silversmith
at
this
rate
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
been
working
uninterruptedly
,
"
he
replied
,
"
I
have
been
assisting
Miss
Fairfax
in
trying
to
make
her
instrument
stand
steadily
,
it
was
not
quite
firm
;
an
unevenness
in
the
floor
,
I
believe
.
<EOS>
You
see
we
have
been
wedging
one
leg
with
paper
.
<EOS>
This
was
very
kind
of
you
to
be
persuaded
to
come
.
<EOS>
I
was
almost
afraid
you
would
be
hurrying
home
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
contrived
that
she
should
be
seated
by
him
;
and
was
sufficiently
employed
in
looking
out
the
best
baked
apple
for
her
,
and
trying
to
make
her
help
or
advise
him
in
his
work
,
till
Jane
Fairfax
was
quite
ready
to
sit
down
to
the
pianoforte
again
.
<EOS>
That
she
was
not
immediately
ready
,
Emma
did
suspect
to
arise
from
the
state
of
her
nerves
;
she
had
not
yet
possessed
the
instrument
long
enough
to
touch
it
without
emotion
;
she
must
reason
herself
into
the
power
of
performance
;
and
Emma
could
not
but
pity
such
feelings
,
whatever
their
origin
,
and
could
not
but
resolve
never
to
expose
them
to
her
neighbour
again
.
  
<EOS>
At
last
Jane
began
,
and
though
the
first
bars
were
feebly
given
,
the
powers
of
the
instrument
were
gradually
done
full
justice
to
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Weston
had
been
delighted
before
,
and
was
delighted
again
;
Emma
joined
her
in
all
her
praise
;
and
the
pianoforte
,
with
every
proper
discrimination
,
was
pronounced
to
be
altogether
of
the
highest
promise
.
  
<EOS>
"
Whoever
Colonel
Campbell
might
employ
,
"
said
Frank
Churchill
,
with
a
smile
at
Emma
,
"
the
person
has
not
chosen
ill
.
<EOS>
I
heard
a
good
deal
of
Colonel
Campbell
's
taste
at
Weymouth
;
and
the
softness
of
the
upper
notes
I
am
sure
is
exactly
what
he
and
_
<EOS>
all
_
_
that
_
_
party
_
would
particularly
prize
.
<EOS>
I
dare
say
,
Miss
Fairfax
,
that
he
either
gave
his
friend
very
minute
directions
,
or
wrote
to
Broadwood
himself
.
<EOS>
Do
not
you
think
so
?
"
  
<EOS>
Jane
did
not
look
round
.
<EOS>
She
was
not
obliged
to
hear
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Weston
had
been
speaking
to
her
at
the
same
moment
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
fair
,
"
said
Emma
,
in
a
whisper
;
"
mine
was
a
random
guess
.
<EOS>
Do
not
distress
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
shook
his
head
with
a
smile
,
and
looked
as
if
he
had
very
little
doubt
and
very
little
mercy
.
<EOS>
Soon
afterwards
he
began
again
,
  
<EOS>
"
How
much
your
friends
in
Ireland
must
be
enjoying
your
pleasure
on
this
occasion
,
Miss
Fairfax
.
<EOS>
I
dare
say
they
often
think
of
you
,
and
wonder
which
will
be
the
day
,
the
precise
day
of
the
instrument
's
coming
to
hand
.
<EOS>
Do
you
imagine
Colonel
Campbell
knows
the
business
to
be
going
forward
just
at
this
time
?
 
<EOS>
Do
you
imagine
it
to
be
the
consequence
of
an
immediate
commission
from
him
,
or
that
he
may
have
sent
only
a
general
direction
,
an
order
indefinite
as
to
time
,
to
depend
upon
contingencies
and
conveniences
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
paused
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
but
hear
;
she
could
not
avoid
answering
,
  
<EOS>
"
Till
I
have
a
letter
from
Colonel
Campbell
,
"
said
she
,
in
a
voice
of
forced
calmness
,
"
I
can
imagine
nothing
with
any
confidence
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
all
conjecture
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Conjecture
 
aye
,
sometimes
one
conjectures
right
,
and
sometimes
one
conjectures
wrong
.
<EOS>
I
wish
I
could
conjecture
how
soon
I
shall
make
this
rivet
quite
firm
.
<EOS>
What
nonsense
one
talks
,
Miss
Woodhouse
,
when
hard
at
work
,
if
one
talks
at
all
;
 
your
real
workmen
,
I
suppose
,
hold
their
tongues
;
but
we
gentlemen
labourers
if
we
get
hold
of
a
word
 
<EOS>
Miss
Fairfax
said
something
about
conjecturing
.
<EOS>
There
,
it
is
done
.
<EOS>
I
have
the
pleasure
,
madam
,
(
to
Mrs.
Bates
,
)
of
restoring
your
spectacles
,
healed
for
the
present
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
was
very
warmly
thanked
both
by
mother
and
daughter
;
to
escape
a
little
from
the
latter
,
he
went
to
the
pianoforte
,
and
begged
Miss
Fairfax
,
who
was
still
sitting
at
it
,
to
play
something
more
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
are
very
kind
,
"
said
he
,
"
it
will
be
one
of
the
waltzes
we
danced
last
night
;
 
let
me
live
them
over
again
.
<EOS>
You
did
not
enjoy
them
as
I
did
;
you
appeared
tired
the
whole
time
.
<EOS>
I
believe
you
were
glad
we
danced
no
longer
;
but
I
would
have
given
worlds
 
all
the
worlds
one
ever
has
to
give
 
for
another
half
-
hour
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
played
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
felicity
it
is
to
hear
a
tune
again
which
_
has
_
made
one
happy
!
 
<EOS>
If
I
mistake
not
that
was
danced
at
Weymouth
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
looked
up
at
him
for
a
moment
,
coloured
deeply
,
and
played
something
else
.
<EOS>
He
took
some
music
from
a
chair
near
the
pianoforte
,
and
turning
to
Emma
,
said
,
  
"
<EOS>
Here
is
something
quite
new
to
me
.
<EOS>
Do
you
know
it
?
 
<EOS>
Cramer
.
 
<EOS>
And
here
are
a
new
set
of
Irish
melodies
.
<EOS>
That
,
from
such
a
quarter
,
one
might
expect
.
<EOS>
This
was
all
sent
with
the
instrument
.
<EOS>
Very
thoughtful
of
Colonel
Campbell
,
was
not
it
?
 
<EOS>
He
knew
Miss
Fairfax
could
have
no
music
here
.
<EOS>
I
honour
that
part
of
the
attention
particularly
;
it
shews
it
to
have
been
so
thoroughly
from
the
heart
.
<EOS>
Nothing
hastily
done
;
nothing
incomplete
.
<EOS>
True
affection
only
could
have
prompted
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
wished
he
would
be
less
pointed
,
yet
could
not
help
being
amused
;
and
when
on
glancing
her
eye
towards
Jane
Fairfax
she
caught
the
remains
of
a
smile
,
when
she
saw
that
with
all
the
deep
blush
of
consciousness
,
there
had
been
a
smile
of
secret
delight
,
she
had
less
scruple
in
the
amusement
,
and
much
less
compunction
with
respect
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
This
amiable
,
upright
,
perfect
Jane
Fairfax
was
apparently
cherishing
very
reprehensible
feelings
.
  
<EOS>
He
brought
all
the
music
to
her
,
and
they
looked
it
over
together
.
 
<EOS>
Emma
took
the
opportunity
of
whispering
,
  
<EOS>
"
You
speak
too
plain
.
<EOS>
She
must
understand
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
she
does
.
<EOS>
I
would
have
her
understand
me
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
in
the
least
ashamed
of
my
meaning
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
really
,
I
am
half
ashamed
,
and
wish
I
had
never
taken
up
the
idea
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
glad
you
did
,
and
that
you
communicated
it
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
now
a
key
to
all
her
odd
looks
and
ways
.
<EOS>
Leave
shame
to
her
.
<EOS>
If
she
does
wrong
,
she
ought
to
feel
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
is
not
entirely
without
it
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
see
much
sign
of
it
.
<EOS>
She
is
playing
_
Robin
_
_
Adair
_
at
this
moment
 
_
his
_
favourite
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Shortly
afterwards
Miss
Bates
,
passing
near
the
window
,
descried
Mr.
Knightley
on
horse
-
back
not
far
off
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Knightley
I
declare
!
 
<EOS>
I
must
speak
to
him
if
possible
,
just
to
thank
him
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
open
the
window
here
;
it
would
give
you
all
cold
;
but
I
can
go
into
my
mother
's
room
you
know
.
<EOS>
I
dare
say
he
will
come
in
when
he
knows
who
is
here
.
<EOS>
Quite
delightful
to
have
you
all
meet
so
!
 
<EOS>
Our
little
room
so
honoured
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
was
in
the
adjoining
chamber
while
she
still
spoke
,
and
opening
the
casement
there
,
immediately
called
Mr.
Knightley
's
attention
,
and
every
syllable
of
their
conversation
was
as
distinctly
heard
by
the
others
,
as
if
it
had
passed
within
the
same
apartment
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
d
'
ye
do
?
 
<EOS>
how
d'ye
do
?
 
<EOS>
Very
well
,
I
thank
you
.
<EOS>
So
obliged
to
you
for
the
carriage
last
night
.
<EOS>
We
were
just
in
time
;
my
mother
just
ready
for
us
.
<EOS>
Pray
come
in
;
do
come
in
.
<EOS>
You
will
find
some
friends
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
So
began
Miss
Bates
;
and
Mr.
Knightley
seemed
determined
to
be
heard
in
his
turn
,
for
most
resolutely
and
commandingly
<EOS>
did
he
say
,
  
"
<EOS>
How
is
your
niece
,
Miss
Bates
?
 
<EOS>
I
want
to
inquire
after
you
all
,
but
particularly
your
niece
.
<EOS>
How
is
Miss
Fairfax
?
 
<EOS>
I
hope
she
caught
no
cold
last
night
.
<EOS>
How
is
she
to
-
day
?
<EOS>
Tell
me
how
Miss
Fairfax
is
.
"
  
<EOS>
And
Miss
Bates
was
obliged
to
give
a
direct
answer
before
he
would
hear
her
in
any
thing
else
.
<EOS>
The
listeners
were
amused
;
and
Mrs.
Weston
gave
Emma
a
look
of
particular
meaning
.
<EOS>
But
Emma
still
shook
her
head
in
steady
scepticism
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
obliged
to
you
!
 
<EOS>
so
very
much
obliged
to
you
for
the
carriage
,
"
resumed
Miss
Bates
.
  
<EOS>
He
cut
her
short
with
,
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
going
to
Kingston
.
<EOS>
Can
I
do
any
thing
for
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
<EOS>
dear
,
Kingston
 
are
you
?
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Cole
was
saying
the
other
day
she
wanted
something
from
Kingston
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Mrs.
Cole
has
servants
to
send
.
<EOS>
Can
I
do
any
thing
for
_
you
_
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
thank
you
.
<EOS>
But
do
come
in
.
<EOS>
Who
do
you
think
is
here
?
 
<EOS>
Miss
Woodhouse
and
Miss
Smith
;
<EOS>
so
kind
as
to
call
to
hear
the
new
pianoforte
.
<EOS>
Do
put
up
your
horse
at
the
Crown
,
and
come
in
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
said
he
,
in
a
deliberating
manner
,
"
for
five
minutes
,
perhaps
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
here
is
Mrs.
Weston
and
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
too
!
 
<EOS>
Quite
delightful
;
so
many
friends
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
not
now
,
I
thank
you
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
stay
two
minutes
.
<EOS>
I
must
get
on
to
Kingston
as
fast
as
I
can
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
do
come
in
.
<EOS>
They
will
be
so
very
happy
to
see
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
;
your
room
is
full
enough
.
<EOS>
I
will
call
another
day
,
and
hear
the
pianoforte
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
am
so
sorry
!
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
Mr.
Knightley
,
what
a
delightful
party
last
night
;
how
extremely
pleasant
.
 
<EOS>
Did
you
ever
see
such
dancing
?
 
<EOS>
Was
not
it
delightful
?
 
<EOS>
Miss
Woodhouse
and
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
<EOS>
;
I
never
saw
any
thing
equal
to
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
very
delightful
indeed
;
I
can
say
nothing
less
,
for
I
suppose
Miss
Woodhouse
and
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
are
hearing
every
thing
that
passes
.
<EOS>
And
(
raising
his
voice
still
more
)
I
do
not
see
why
Miss
Fairfax
should
not
be
mentioned
too
.
<EOS>
I
think
Miss
Fairfax
dances
very
well
;
and
Mrs.
Weston
is
the
very
best
country
-
dance
player
,
without
exception
,
in
England
.
<EOS>
Now
,
if
your
friends
have
any
gratitude
,
they
will
say
something
pretty
loud
about
you
and
me
in
return
;
but
I
can
not
stay
to
hear
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
Mr.
Knightley
,
one
moment
more
;
something
of
consequence
 
<EOS>
so
shocked
!
 
<EOS>
Jane
and
I
are
both
so
shocked
about
the
apples
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
the
matter
now
?
"
  
"
To
think
of
your
sending
us
all
your
store
apples
.
<EOS>
You
said
you
had
a
great
many
,
and
now
you
have
not
one
left
.
<EOS>
We
really
are
so
shocked
!
<EOS>
Mrs.
Hodges
may
well
be
angry
.
<EOS>
William
Larkins
mentioned
it
here
.
<EOS>
You
should
not
have
done
it
,
indeed
you
should
not
.
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
he
is
off
.
<EOS>
He
never
can
bear
to
be
thanked
.
<EOS>
But
I
thought
he
would
have
staid
now
,
and
it
would
have
been
a
pity
not
to
have
mentioned
....
<EOS>
Well
,
(
returning
to
the
room
,
)
I
have
not
been
able
to
succeed
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Knightley
can
not
stop
.
<EOS>
He
is
going
to
Kingston
.
<EOS>
He
asked
me
if
he
could
do
any
thing
....
<EOS>
"
  
"
Yes
,
"
said
Jane
,
"
we
heard
his
kind
offers
,
we
heard
every
thing
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
yes
,
my
dear
,
I
dare
say
you
might
,
because
you
know
,
the
door
was
open
,
and
the
window
was
open
,
and
Mr.
Knightley
spoke
loud
.
<EOS>
You
must
have
heard
every
thing
to
be
sure
.
<EOS>
"
Can
I
do
any
thing
for
you
at
Kingston
?
"
said
he
;
so
I
just
mentioned
....
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
Miss
Woodhouse
,
must
you
be
going
?
 
<EOS>
You
seem
but
just
come
 
so
very
obliging
of
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
found
it
really
time
to
be
at
home
;
the
visit
had
already
lasted
long
;
and
on
examining
watches
,
so
much
of
the
morning
was
perceived
to
be
gone
,
that
Mrs.
Weston
and
her
companion
taking
leave
also
,
could
allow
themselves
only
to
walk
with
the
two
young
ladies
to
Hartfield
gates
,
before
they
set
off
for
Randalls
.
    
<EOS>
It
may
be
possible
to
do
without
dancing
entirely
.
<EOS>
Instances
have
been
known
of
young
people
passing
many
,
many
months
successively
,
without
being
at
any
ball
of
any
description
,
and
no
material
injury
accrue
either
to
body
or
mind
;
 
but
when
a
beginning
is
made
 
<EOS>
when
the
felicities
of
rapid
motion
have
once
been
,
though
slightly
,
felt
 
it
must
be
a
very
heavy
set
that
does
not
ask
for
more
.
  
<EOS>
Frank
Churchill
had
danced
once
at
Highbury
,
and
longed
to
dance
again
;
and
the
last
half
-
hour
of
an
evening
which
Mr.
Woodhouse
was
persuaded
to
spend
with
his
daughter
at
Randalls
,
was
passed
by
the
two
young
people
in
schemes
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
Frank
's
was
the
first
idea
;
and
his
the
greatest
zeal
in
pursuing
it
;
for
the
lady
was
the
best
judge
of
the
difficulties
,
and
the
most
solicitous
for
accommodation
and
appearance
.
<EOS>
But
still
she
had
inclination
enough
for
shewing
people
again
<EOS>
how
delightfully
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
and
Miss
Woodhouse
danced
 
for
doing
that
in
which
she
need
not
blush
to
compare
herself
with
Jane
Fairfax
 
and
even
for
simple
dancing
itself
,
without
any
of
the
wicked
aids
of
vanity
 
to
assist
him
first
in
pacing
out
the
room
they
were
in
to
see
what
it
could
be
made
to
hold
 
and
then
in
taking
the
dimensions
of
the
other
parlour
,
in
the
hope
of
discovering
,
in
spite
of
all
that
Mr.
Weston
could
say
of
their
exactly
equal
size
,
that
it
was
a
little
the
largest
.
  
<EOS>
His
first
proposition
and
request
,
that
the
dance
begun
at
Mr.
Cole
's
should
be
finished
there
 
that
the
same
party
should
be
collected
,
and
the
same
musician
engaged
,
met
with
the
readiest
acquiescence
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Weston
entered
into
the
idea
with
thorough
enjoyment
,
and
Mrs.
Weston
most
willingly
undertook
to
play
as
long
as
they
could
wish
to
dance
;
and
the
interesting
employment
had
followed
,
of
reckoning
up
exactly
who
there
would
be
,
and
portioning
out
the
indispensable
division
of
space
to
every
couple
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
and
Miss
Smith
,
and
Miss
Fairfax
,
will
be
three
,
and
the
two
Miss
Coxes
five
,
"
had
been
repeated
many
times
over
.
"
<EOS>
And
there
will
be
the
two
Gilberts
,
young
Cox
,
my
father
,
and
myself
,
besides
Mr.
Knightley
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
that
will
be
quite
enough
for
pleasure
.
<EOS>
You
and
Miss
Smith
,
and
Miss
Fairfax
,
will
be
three
,
and
the
two
Miss
Coxes
five
;
and
for
five
couple
there
will
be
plenty
of
room
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
But
soon
it
came
to
be
on
one
side
,
  
"
<EOS>
But
will
there
be
good
room
for
five
couple
?
 
<EOS>
I
really
do
not
think
there
will
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
On
another
,
  
"
And
after
all
,
five
couple
are
not
enough
to
make
it
worth
while
to
stand
up
.
<EOS>
Five
couple
are
nothing
,
when
one
thinks
seriously
about
it
.
<EOS>
It
will
not
do
to
_
invite
_
five
couple
.
<EOS>
It
can
be
allowable
only
as
the
thought
of
the
moment
.
"
  
<EOS>
Somebody
said
that
_
Miss
_
Gilbert
was
expected
at
her
brother
's
,
and
must
be
invited
with
the
rest
.
<EOS>
Somebody
else
believed
_
<EOS>
Mrs
_
.
<EOS>
Gilbert
would
have
danced
the
other
evening
,
if
she
had
been
asked
.
<EOS>
A
word
was
put
in
for
a
second
young
Cox
;
and
at
last
,
Mr.
Weston
naming
one
family
of
cousins
who
must
be
included
,
and
another
of
very
old
acquaintance
who
could
not
be
left
out
,
it
became
a
certainty
that
the
five
couple
would
be
at
least
ten
,
and
a
very
interesting
speculation
in
what
possible
manner
they
could
be
disposed
of
.
  
<EOS>
The
doors
of
the
two
rooms
were
just
opposite
each
other
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Might
not
they
use
both
rooms
,
and
dance
across
the
passage
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
It
seemed
the
best
scheme
;
and
yet
it
was
not
so
good
but
that
many
of
them
wanted
a
better
.
<EOS>
Emma
said
it
would
be
awkward
;
Mrs.
Weston
was
in
distress
about
the
supper
;
and
Mr.
Woodhouse
opposed
it
earnestly
,
on
the
score
of
health
.
<EOS>
It
made
him
so
very
unhappy
,
indeed
,
that
it
could
not
be
persevered
in
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
no
,
"
said
he
;
"
it
would
be
the
extreme
of
imprudence
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
bear
it
for
Emma
!
 
<EOS>
Emma
is
not
strong
.
<EOS>
She
would
catch
a
dreadful
cold
.
<EOS>
So
would
poor
little
Harriet
.
<EOS>
So
you
would
all
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Weston
,
you
would
be
quite
laid
up
;
do
not
let
them
talk
of
such
a
wild
thing
.
<EOS>
Pray
do
not
let
them
talk
of
it
.
<EOS>
That
young
man
(
speaking
lower
)
is
very
thoughtless
.
<EOS>
Do
not
tell
his
father
,
but
that
young
man
is
not
quite
the
thing
.
<EOS>
He
has
been
opening
the
doors
very
often
this
evening
,
and
keeping
them
open
very
inconsiderately
.
<EOS>
He
does
not
think
of
the
draught
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
mean
to
set
you
against
him
,
but
indeed
he
is
not
quite
the
thing
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Weston
was
sorry
for
such
a
charge
.
<EOS>
She
knew
the
importance
of
it
,
and
said
every
thing
in
her
power
to
do
it
away
.
<EOS>
Every
door
was
now
closed
,
the
passage
plan
given
up
,
and
the
first
scheme
of
dancing
only
in
the
room
they
were
in
resorted
to
again
;
and
with
such
good
-
will
on
Frank
Churchill
's
part
,
that
the
space
which
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
had
been
deemed
barely
sufficient
for
five
couple
,
was
now
endeavoured
to
be
made
out
quite
enough
for
ten
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
were
too
magnificent
,
"
said
he
.
<EOS>
"
We
allowed
unnecessary
room
.
<EOS>
Ten
couple
may
stand
here
very
well
.
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
demurred
.
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
a
crowd
 
a
sad
crowd
;
and
what
could
be
worse
than
dancing
without
space
to
turn
in
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
true
,
"
he
gravely
replied
;
"
it
was
very
bad
.
"
<EOS>
But
still
he
went
on
measuring
,
and
still
he
ended
with
,
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
there
will
be
very
tolerable
room
for
ten
couple
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
"
said
she
,
"
you
are
quite
unreasonable
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
dreadful
to
be
standing
so
close
!
<EOS>
Nothing
can
be
farther
from
pleasure
than
to
be
dancing
in
a
crowd
 
and
a
crowd
in
a
little
room
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
no
denying
it
,
"
he
replied
.
<EOS>
"
I
agree
with
you
exactly
.
<EOS>
A
crowd
in
a
little
room
 
<EOS>
Miss
Woodhouse
,
you
have
the
art
of
giving
pictures
in
a
few
words
.
<EOS>
Exquisite
,
quite
exquisite
!
 
<EOS>
Still
,
however
,
having
proceeded
so
far
,
one
is
unwilling
to
give
the
matter
up
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
a
disappointment
to
my
father
 
and
altogether
 
I
do
not
know
that
 
I
am
rather
of
opinion
that
ten
couple
might
stand
here
very
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
perceived
that
the
nature
of
his
gallantry
was
a
little
self
-
willed
,
and
that
he
would
rather
oppose
than
lose
the
pleasure
of
dancing
with
her
;
but
she
took
the
compliment
,
and
forgave
the
rest
.
<EOS>
Had
she
intended
ever
to
_
marry
<EOS>
_
him
,
it
might
have
been
worth
while
to
pause
and
consider
,
and
try
to
understand
the
value
of
his
preference
,
and
the
character
of
his
temper
;
but
for
all
the
purposes
of
their
acquaintance
,
he
was
quite
amiable
enough
.
  
<EOS>
Before
the
middle
of
the
next
day
,
he
was
at
Hartfield
;
and
he
entered
the
room
with
such
an
agreeable
smile
as
certified
the
continuance
of
the
scheme
.
<EOS>
It
soon
appeared
that
he
came
to
announce
an
improvement
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Miss
Woodhouse
,
"
he
almost
immediately
began
,
"
<EOS>
your
inclination
for
dancing
has
not
been
quite
frightened
away
,
I
hope
,
by
the
terrors
of
my
father
's
little
rooms
.
<EOS>
I
bring
a
new
proposal
on
the
subject
:
 
a
thought
of
my
father
's
,
which
waits
only
your
approbation
to
be
acted
upon
.
<EOS>
May
I
hope
for
the
honour
of
your
hand
for
the
two
first
dances
of
this
little
projected
ball
,
to
be
given
,
not
at
Randalls
,
but
at
the
Crown
Inn
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
Crown
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
if
you
and
Mr.
Woodhouse
see
no
objection
,
and
I
trust
you
can
not
,
my
father
hopes
his
friends
will
be
so
kind
as
to
visit
him
there
.
<EOS>
Better
accommodations
,
he
can
promise
them
,
and
not
a
less
grateful
welcome
than
at
Randalls
.
<EOS>
It
is
his
own
idea
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Weston
sees
no
objection
to
it
,
provided
you
are
satisfied
.
<EOS>
This
is
what
we
all
feel
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
you
were
perfectly
right
!
<EOS>
Ten
couple
,
in
either
of
the
Randalls
rooms
,
would
have
been
insufferable
!
 
<EOS>
Dreadful
!
 
<EOS>
I
felt
how
right
you
were
the
whole
time
,
but
was
too
anxious
for
securing
_
any
_
_
thing
_
to
like
to
yield
.
<EOS>
Is
not
it
a
good
exchange
?
 
<EOS>
You
consent
 
<EOS>
I
hope
you
consent
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
appears
to
me
a
plan
that
nobody
can
object
to
,
if
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Weston
do
not
.
<EOS>
I
think
it
admirable
;
and
,
as
far
as
I
can
answer
for
myself
,
shall
be
most
happy
 
<EOS>
It
seems
the
only
improvement
that
could
be
.
<EOS>
Papa
,
do
you
not
think
it
an
excellent
improvement
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
was
obliged
to
repeat
and
explain
it
,
before
it
was
fully
comprehended
;
and
then
,
being
quite
new
,
farther
representations
were
necessary
to
make
it
acceptable
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
;
he
thought
it
very
far
from
an
improvement
 
a
very
bad
plan
 
much
worse
than
the
other
.
<EOS>
A
room
at
an
inn
was
always
damp
and
dangerous
;
never
properly
aired
,
or
fit
to
be
inhabited
.
<EOS>
If
they
must
dance
,
they
had
better
dance
at
Randalls
.
<EOS>
He
had
never
been
in
the
room
at
the
Crown
in
his
life
 
<EOS>
did
not
know
the
people
who
kept
it
by
sight
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
no
 
<EOS>
a
very
bad
plan
.
<EOS>
They
would
catch
worse
colds
at
the
Crown
than
anywhere
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
going
to
observe
,
sir
,
"
said
Frank
Churchill
,
"
that
one
of
the
great
recommendations
of
this
change
would
be
the
very
little
danger
of
any
body
's
catching
cold
 
<EOS>
so
much
less
danger
at
the
Crown
than
at
Randalls
!
<EOS>
Mr.
Perry
might
have
reason
to
regret
the
alteration
,
but
nobody
else
could
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
said
Mr.
Woodhouse
,
rather
warmly
,
"
you
are
very
much
mistaken
if
you
suppose
Mr.
Perry
to
be
that
sort
of
character
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Perry
is
extremely
concerned
when
any
of
us
are
ill
.
<EOS>
But
I
do
not
understand
how
the
room
at
the
Crown
can
be
safer
for
you
than
your
father
's
house
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
From
the
very
circumstance
of
its
being
larger
,
sir
.
<EOS>
We
shall
have
no
occasion
to
open
the
windows
at
all
 
not
once
the
whole
evening
;
and
it
is
that
dreadful
habit
of
opening
the
windows
,
letting
in
cold
air
upon
heated
bodies
,
which
(
as
you
well
know
,
sir
)
does
the
mischief
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Open
the
windows
!
 
<EOS>
but
surely
,
Mr.
Churchill
,
nobody
would
think
of
opening
the
windows
at
Randalls
.
<EOS>
Nobody
could
be
so
imprudent
!
<EOS>
I
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
.
<EOS>
Dancing
with
open
windows
!
 
<EOS>
I
am
sure
,
neither
your
father
nor
Mrs.
Weston
(
poor
Miss
Taylor
that
was
)
would
suffer
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
sir
 
but
<EOS>
a
thoughtless
young
person
will
sometimes
step
behind
a
window
-
curtain
,
and
throw
up
a
sash
,
without
its
being
suspected
.
<EOS>
I
have
often
known
it
done
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Have
you
indeed
,
sir
?
 
Bless
me
!
<EOS>
I
never
could
have
supposed
it
.
<EOS>
But
I
live
out
of
the
world
,
and
am
often
astonished
at
what
I
hear
.
<EOS>
However
,
this
does
make
a
difference
;
and
,
perhaps
,
when
we
come
to
talk
it
over
 
<EOS>
but
these
sort
of
things
require
a
good
deal
of
consideration
.
<EOS>
One
can
not
resolve
upon
them
in
a
hurry
.
<EOS>
If
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Weston
will
be
so
obliging
as
to
call
here
one
morning
,
we
may
talk
it
over
,
and
see
what
can
be
done
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
unfortunately
,
sir
,
my
time
is
so
limited
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
Oh
!
"
interrupted
Emma
,
"
there
will
be
plenty
of
time
for
talking
every
thing
over
.
<EOS>
There
is
no
hurry
at
all
.
<EOS>
If
it
can
be
contrived
to
be
at
the
Crown
,
papa
,
it
will
be
very
convenient
for
the
horses
.
<EOS>
They
will
be
so
near
their
own
stable
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
So
they
will
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
That
is
a
great
thing
.
<EOS>
Not
that
James
ever
complains
;
but
it
is
right
to
spare
our
horses
when
we
can
.
<EOS>
If
I
could
be
sure
of
the
rooms
being
thoroughly
aired
 
but
is
Mrs.
Stokes
to
be
trusted
?
<EOS>
I
doubt
it
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
her
,
even
by
sight
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
answer
for
every
thing
of
that
nature
,
sir
,
because
it
will
be
under
Mrs.
Weston
's
care
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Weston
undertakes
to
direct
the
whole
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
,
papa
!
 
<EOS>
Now
you
must
be
satisfied
 
<EOS>
Our
own
dear
Mrs.
Weston
,
who
is
carefulness
itself
.
<EOS>
Do
not
you
remember
what
Mr.
Perry
said
,
so
many
years
ago
,
when
I
had
the
measles
?
<EOS>
"
If
_
Miss
_
_
Taylor
_
undertakes
to
wrap
Miss
Emma
up
,
you
need
not
have
any
fears
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
How
often
have
I
heard
you
speak
of
it
as
such
a
compliment
to
her
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
very
true
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Perry
did
say
so
.
<EOS>
I
shall
never
forget
it
.
<EOS>
Poor
little
Emma
!
<EOS>
You
were
very
bad
with
the
measles
;
that
is
,
you
would
have
been
very
bad
,
but
for
Perry
's
great
attention
.
<EOS>
He
came
four
times
a
day
for
a
week
.
<EOS>
He
said
,
from
the
first
,
it
was
a
very
good
sort
 
which
was
our
great
comfort
;
but
the
measles
are
a
dreadful
complaint
.
<EOS>
I
hope
whenever
poor
Isabella
's
little
ones
have
the
measles
,
she
will
send
for
Perry
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
father
and
Mrs.
Weston
are
at
the
Crown
at
this
moment
,
"
said
Frank
Churchill
,
"
examining
the
capabilities
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
I
left
them
there
and
came
on
to
Hartfield
,
impatient
for
your
opinion
,
and
hoping
you
might
be
persuaded
to
join
them
and
give
your
advice
on
the
spot
.
<EOS>
I
was
desired
to
say
so
from
both
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
the
greatest
pleasure
to
them
,
if
you
could
allow
me
to
attend
you
there
.
<EOS>
They
can
do
nothing
satisfactorily
without
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
was
most
happy
to
be
called
to
such
a
council
;
and
her
father
,
engaging
to
think
it
all
over
while
she
was
gone
,
the
two
young
people
set
off
together
without
delay
for
the
Crown
.
<EOS>
There
were
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Weston
;
delighted
to
see
her
and
receive
her
approbation
,
very
busy
and
very
happy
in
their
different
way
;
she
,
in
some
little
distress
;
and
he
,
finding
every
thing
perfect
.
  
<EOS>
"
Emma
,
"
said
she
,
"
this
paper
is
worse
than
I
expected
.
<EOS>
Look
!
<EOS>
in
places
you
see
it
is
dreadfully
dirty
;
and
the
wainscot
is
more
yellow
and
forlorn
than
any
thing
I
could
have
imagined
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
you
are
too
particular
,
"
said
her
husband
.
<EOS>
"
What
does
all
that
signify
?
<EOS>
You
will
see
nothing
of
it
by
candlelight
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
as
clean
as
Randalls
by
candlelight
.
<EOS>
We
never
see
any
thing
of
it
on
our
club
-
nights
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
ladies
here
probably
exchanged
looks
which
meant
,
"
Men
never
know
when
things
are
dirty
or
not
;
"
and
the
gentlemen
perhaps
thought
each
to
himself
,
"
Women
will
have
their
little
nonsenses
and
needless
cares
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
One
perplexity
,
however
,
arose
,
which
the
gentlemen
did
not
disdain
.
<EOS>
It
regarded
a
supper
-
room
.
<EOS>
At
the
time
of
the
ballroom
's
being
built
,
suppers
had
not
been
in
question
;
and
a
small
card
-
room
adjoining
,
was
the
only
addition
.
<EOS>
What
was
to
be
done
?
<EOS>
This
card
-
room
would
be
wanted
as
a
card
-
room
now
;
or
,
if
cards
were
conveniently
voted
unnecessary
by
their
four
selves
,
still
was
it
not
too
small
for
any
comfortable
supper
?
<EOS>
Another
room
of
much
better
size
might
be
secured
for
the
purpose
;
but
it
was
at
the
other
end
of
the
house
,
and
a
long
awkward
passage
must
be
gone
through
to
get
at
it
.
<EOS>
This
made
a
difficulty
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Weston
was
afraid
of
draughts
for
the
young
people
in
that
passage
;
and
neither
Emma
nor
the
gentlemen
could
tolerate
the
prospect
of
being
miserably
crowded
at
supper
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Weston
proposed
having
no
regular
supper
;
merely
sandwiches
,
&
c.
,
set
out
in
the
little
room
;
but
that
was
scouted
as
a
wretched
suggestion
.
<EOS>
A
private
dance
,
without
sitting
down
to
supper
,
was
pronounced
an
infamous
fraud
upon
the
rights
of
men
and
women
;
and
Mrs.
Weston
must
not
speak
of
it
again
.
<EOS>
She
then
took
another
line
of
expediency
,
and
looking
into
the
doubtful
room
,
observed
,
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
it
_
is
_
so
very
small
.
<EOS>
We
shall
not
be
many
,
you
know
.
"
  
<EOS>
And
Mr.
Weston
at
the
same
time
,
walking
briskly
with
long
steps
through
the
passage
,
was
calling
out
,
  
<EOS>
"
You
talk
a
great
deal
of
the
length
of
this
passage
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
mere
nothing
after
all
;
and
not
the
least
draught
from
the
stairs
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
,
"
said
Mrs.
Weston
,
"
one
could
know
which
arrangement
our
guests
in
general
would
like
best
.
<EOS>
To
do
what
would
be
most
generally
pleasing
must
be
our
object
 
if
one
could
but
tell
what
that
would
be
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
very
true
,
"
cried
Frank
,
"
very
true
.
<EOS>
You
want
your
neighbours
'
opinions
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
wonder
at
you
.
<EOS>
If
one
could
ascertain
what
the
chief
of
them
 
the
Coles
,
for
instance
.
<EOS>
They
are
not
far
off
.
<EOS>
Shall
I
call
upon
them
?
<EOS>
Or
Miss
Bates
?
<EOS>
She
is
still
nearer
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
do
not
know
whether
Miss
Bates
is
not
as
likely
to
understand
the
inclinations
of
the
rest
of
the
people
as
any
body
.
<EOS>
I
think
we
do
want
a
larger
council
.
<EOS>
Suppose
I
go
and
invite
Miss
Bates
to
join
us
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
 
if
you
please
,
"
said
Mrs.
Weston
rather
hesitating
,
"
if
you
think
she
will
be
of
any
use
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
get
nothing
to
the
purpose
from
Miss
Bates
,
"
said
Emma
.
<EOS>
"
She
will
be
all
delight
and
gratitude
,
but
she
will
tell
you
nothing
.
<EOS>
She
will
not
even
listen
to
your
questions
.
<EOS>
I
see
no
advantage
in
consulting
Miss
Bates
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
she
is
so
amusing
,
so
extremely
amusing
!
<EOS>
I
am
very
fond
of
hearing
Miss
Bates
talk
.
<EOS>
And
I
need
not
bring
the
whole
family
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Here
Mr.
Weston
joined
them
,
and
on
hearing
what
was
proposed
,
gave
it
his
decided
approbation
.
  
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
do
,
Frank
.
 
<EOS>
Go
and
fetch
Miss
Bates
,
and
let
us
end
the
matter
at
once
.
<EOS>
She
will
enjoy
the
scheme
,
I
am
sure
;
and
I
do
not
know
a
properer
person
for
shewing
us
how
to
do
away
difficulties
.
<EOS>
Fetch
Miss
Bates
.
<EOS>
We
are
growing
a
little
too
nice
.
<EOS>
She
is
a
standing
lesson
of
how
to
be
happy
.
<EOS>
But
fetch
them
both
.
<EOS>
Invite
them
both
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Both
sir
!
<EOS>
Can
the
old
lady
?
"
<EOS>
...
  
<EOS>
"
The
old
lady
!
<EOS>
No
,
the
young
lady
,
to
be
sure
.
<EOS>
I
shall
think
you
a
great
blockhead
,
Frank
,
if
you
bring
the
aunt
without
the
niece
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Oh
!
I
beg
your
pardon
,
sir
.
<EOS>
I
did
not
immediately
recollect
.
<EOS>
Undoubtedly
if
you
wish
it
,
I
will
endeavour
to
persuade
them
both
.
"
<EOS>
And
away
he
ran
.
  
<EOS>
Long
before
he
reappeared
,
attending
the
short
,
neat
,
brisk
-
moving
aunt
,
and
her
elegant
niece
,
 
Mrs.
Weston
,
like
a
sweet
-
tempered
woman
and
a
good
wife
,
had
examined
the
passage
again
,
and
found
the
evils
of
it
much
less
than
she
had
supposed
before
 
indeed
very
trifling
;
and
here
ended
the
difficulties
of
decision
.
<EOS>
All
the
rest
,
in
speculation
at
least
,
was
perfectly
smooth
.
<EOS>
All
the
minor
arrangements
of
table
and
chair
,
lights
and
music
,
tea
and
supper
,
made
themselves
;
or
were
left
as
mere
trifles
to
be
settled
at
any
time
between
Mrs.
Weston
and
Mrs.
Stokes
.
 
<EOS>
Every
body
invited
,
was
certainly
to
come
;
Frank
had
already
written
to
Enscombe
to
propose
staying
a
few
days
beyond
his
fortnight
,
which
could
not
possibly
be
refused
.
<EOS>
And
a
delightful
dance
it
was
to
be
.
  
<EOS>
Most
cordially
,
when
Miss
Bates
arrived
,
did
she
agree
that
it
must
.
<EOS>
As
a
counsellor
she
was
not
wanted
;
but
as
an
approver
,
(
a
much
safer
character
,
)
she
was
truly
welcome
.
<EOS>
Her
approbation
,
at
once
general
and
minute
,
warm
and
incessant
,
could
not
but
please
;
and
for
another
half
-
hour
they
were
all
walking
to
and
fro
,
between
the
different
rooms
,
some
suggesting
,
some
attending
,
and
all
in
happy
enjoyment
of
the
future
.
<EOS>
The
party
did
not
break
up
without
Emma
's
being
positively
secured
for
the
two
first
dances
by
the
hero
of
the
evening
,
nor
without
her
overhearing
Mr.
Weston
whisper
to
his
wife
,
"
He
has
asked
her
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
That
's
right
.
<EOS>
I
knew
he
would
!
"
    
<EOS>
One
thing
only
was
wanting
to
make
the
prospect
of
the
ball
completely
satisfactory
to
Emma
 
its
being
fixed
for
a
day
within
the
granted
term
of
Frank
Churchill
's
stay
in
Surry
;
for
,
in
spite
of
Mr.
Weston
's
confidence
,
she
could
not
think
it
so
very
impossible
that
the
Churchills
might
not
allow
their
nephew
to
remain
a
day
beyond
his
fortnight
.
<EOS>
But
this
was
not
judged
feasible
.
<EOS>
The
preparations
must
take
their
time
,
nothing
could
be
properly
ready
till
the
third
week
were
entered
on
,
and
for
a
few
days
they
must
be
planning
,
proceeding
and
hoping
in
uncertainty
 
at
the
risk
 
in
her
opinion
,
the
great
risk
,
of
its
being
all
in
vain
.
  
<EOS>
Enscombe
however
was
gracious
,
gracious
in
fact
,
if
not
in
word
.
<EOS>
His
wish
of
staying
longer
evidently
did
not
please
;
but
it
was
not
opposed
.
<EOS>
All
was
safe
and
prosperous
;
and
as
the
removal
of
one
solicitude
generally
makes
way
for
another
,
Emma
,
being
now
certain
of
her
ball
,
began
to
adopt
as
the
next
vexation
Mr.
Knightley
's
provoking
indifference
about
it
.
<EOS>
Either
because
he
did
not
dance
himself
,
or
because
the
plan
had
been
formed
without
his
being
consulted
,
he
seemed
resolved
that
it
should
not
interest
him
,
determined
against
its
exciting
any
present
curiosity
,
or
affording
him
any
future
amusement
.
<EOS>
To
her
voluntary

Emma
could
get
no
more
approving
reply
,
than
,
  
"
<EOS>
Very
well
.
<EOS>
If
the
Westons
think
it
worth
while
to
be
at
all
this
trouble
for
a
few
hours
of
noisy
entertainment
,
I
have
nothing
to
say
against
it
,
but
that
they
shall
not
chuse
pleasures
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
yes
,
I
must
be
there
;
I
could
not
refuse
;
and
I
will
keep
as
much
awake
as
I
can
;
but
I
would
rather
be
at
home
,
looking
over
William
Larkins
's
week
's
account
;
much
rather
,
I
confess
.
 
<EOS>
Pleasure
in
seeing
dancing
!
 
<EOS>
not
I
,
indeed
 
I
never
look
at
it
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
who
does
.
 
<EOS>
Fine
dancing
,
I
believe
,
like
virtue
,
must
be
its
own
reward
.
<EOS>
Those
who
are
standing
by
are
usually
thinking
of
something
very
different
.
"
  
<EOS>
This
Emma
felt
was
aimed
at
her
;
and
it
made
her
quite
angry
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
in
compliment
to
Jane
Fairfax
however
that
he
was
so
indifferent
,
or
so
indignant
;
he
was
not
guided
by
_
her
_
feelings
in
reprobating
the
ball
,
for
_
<EOS>
she
_
enjoyed
the
thought
of
it
to
an
extraordinary
degree
.
<EOS>
It
made
her
animated
 
<EOS>
open
hearted
 
<EOS>
she
voluntarily
said
;
    
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
Miss
Woodhouse
,
I
hope
nothing
may
happen
to
prevent
the
ball
.
<EOS>
What
a
disappointment
it
would
be
!
<EOS>
I
do
look
forward
to
it
,
I
own
,
with
_
<EOS>
very
_
great
pleasure
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
not
to
oblige
Jane
Fairfax
therefore
that
he
would
have
preferred
the
society
of
William
Larkins
.
<EOS>
No
!
 
<EOS>
she
was
more
and
more
convinced
that
Mrs.
Weston
was
quite
mistaken
in
that
surmise
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
great
deal
of
friendly
and
of
compassionate
attachment
on
his
side
 
but
no
love
.
  
<EOS>
Alas
!
<EOS>
there
was
soon
no
leisure
for
quarrelling
with
Mr.
Knightley
.
<EOS>
Two
days
of
joyful
security
were
immediately
followed
by
the
over
-
throw
of
every
thing
.
<EOS>
A
letter
arrived
from
Mr.
Churchill
to
urge
his
nephew
's
instant
return
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Churchill
was
unwell
 
far
too
unwell
to
do
without
him
;
she
had
been
in
a
very
suffering
state
(
so
said
her
husband
)
<EOS>
when
writing
to
her
nephew
two
days
before
,
though
from
her
usual
unwillingness
to
give
pain
,
and
constant
habit
of
never
thinking
of
herself
,
she
had
not
mentioned
it
;
but
now
she
was
too
ill
to
trifle
,
and
must
entreat
him
to
set
off
for
Enscombe
without
delay
.
  
<EOS>
The
substance
of
this
letter
was
forwarded
to
Emma
,
in
a
note
from
Mrs.
Weston
,
instantly
.
<EOS>
As
to
his
going
,
it
was
inevitable
.
<EOS>
He
must
be
gone
within
a
few
hours
,
though
without
feeling
any
real
alarm
for
his
aunt
,
to
lessen
his
repugnance
.
<EOS>
He
knew
her
illnesses
;
they
never
occurred
but
for
her
own
convenience
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Weston
added
,
"
that
he
could
only
allow
himself
time
to
hurry
to
Highbury
,
after
breakfast
,
and
take
leave
of
the
few
friends
there
whom
he
could
suppose
to
feel
any
interest
in
him
;
and
that
he
might
be
expected
at
Hartfield
very
soon
.
"
  
<EOS>
This
wretched
note
was
the
finale
of
Emma
's
breakfast
.
<EOS>
When
once
it
had
been
read
,
there
was
no
doing
any
thing
,
but
lament
and
exclaim
.
<EOS>
The
loss
of
the
ball
 
<EOS>
the
loss
of
the
young
man
 
and
all
that
the
young
man
might
be
feeling
!
 
<EOS>
It
was
too
wretched
!
 
<EOS>
Such
a
delightful
evening
as
it
would
have
been
!
 
<EOS>
Every
body
so
happy
!
<EOS>
and
she
and
her
partner
the
happiest
!
 
<EOS>
"
I
said
it
would
be
so
,
"
was
the
only
consolation
.
  
<EOS>
Her
father
's
feelings
were
quite
distinct
.
<EOS>
He
thought
principally
of
Mrs.
Churchill
's
illness
,
and
wanted
to
know
how
she
was
treated
;
and
as
for
the
ball
,
it
was
shocking
to
have
dear
Emma
disappointed
;
but
they
would
all
be
safer
at
home
.
  
<EOS>
Emma
was
ready
for
her
visitor
some
time
before
he
appeared
;
but
if
this
reflected
at
all
upon
his
impatience
,
his
sorrowful
look
and
total
want
of
spirits
when
he
did
come
might
redeem
him
.
<EOS>
He
felt
the
going
away
almost
too
much
to
speak
of
it
.
<EOS>
His
dejection
was
most
evident
.
<EOS>
He
sat
really
lost
in
thought
for
the
first
few
minutes
;
and
when
rousing
himself
,
it
was
only
to
say
,
  
"
Of
all
horrid
things
,
leave
-
taking
is
the
worst
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
will
come
again
,
"
said
Emma
.
<EOS>
"
This
will
not
be
your
only
visit
to
Randalls
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
 
<EOS>
(
shaking
his
head
)
 
<EOS>
the
uncertainty
of
when
I
may
be
able
to
return
!
 
<EOS>
I
shall
try
for
it
with
a
zeal
!
 
<EOS>
It
will
be
the
object
of
all
my
thoughts
and
cares
!
 
<EOS>
and
if
my
uncle
and
aunt
go
to
town
this
spring
 
<EOS>
but
I
am
afraid
 
they
did
not
stir
last
spring
 
<EOS>
I
am
afraid
it
is
a
custom
gone
for
ever
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Our
poor
ball
must
be
quite
given
up
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
that
ball
!
 
<EOS>
why
did
we
wait
for
any
thing
?
 
<EOS>
why
not
seize
the
pleasure
at
once
?
 
<EOS>
How
often
is
happiness
destroyed
by
preparation
,
foolish
preparation
!
 
<EOS>
You
told
us
it
would
be
so
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
Miss
Woodhouse
,
why
are
you
always
so
right
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
,
I
am
very
sorry
to
be
right
in
this
instance
.
<EOS>
I
would
much
rather
have
been
merry
than
wise
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
can
come
again
,
we
are
still
to
have
our
ball
.
<EOS>
My
father
depends
on
it
.
<EOS>
Do
not
forget
your
engagement
.
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
looked
graciously
.
  
<EOS>
"
Such
a
fortnight
as
it
has
been
!
"
he
continued
;
"
every
day
more
precious
and
more
delightful
than
the
day
before
!
 
<EOS>
every
day
making
me
less
fit
to
bear
any
other
place
.
<EOS>
Happy
those
,
who
can
remain
at
Highbury
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
As
you
do
us
such
ample
justice
now
,
"
said
Emma
,
laughing
,
"
I
will
venture
to
ask
,
whether
you
did
not
come
a
little
doubtfully
at
first
?
<EOS>
Do
not
we
rather
surpass
your
expectations
?
<EOS>
I
am
sure
we
do
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
you
did
not
much
expect
to
like
us
.
<EOS>
You
would
not
have
been
so
long
in
coming
,
if
you
had
had
a
pleasant
idea
of
Highbury
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
laughed
rather
consciously
;
and
though
denying
the
sentiment
,
Emma
was
convinced
that
it
had
been
so
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
must
be
off
this
very
morning
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
my
father
is
to
join
me
here
:
we
shall
walk
back
together
,
and
I
must
be
off
immediately
.
<EOS>
I
am
almost
afraid
that
every
moment
will
bring
him
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
Not
five
minutes
to
spare
even
for
your
friends
Miss
Fairfax
and
Miss
Bates
?
<EOS>
How
unlucky
!
<EOS>
Miss
Bates
's
powerful
,
argumentative
mind
might
have
strengthened
yours
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
 
I
_
have
_
called
there
;
passing
the
door
,
I
thought
it
better
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
right
thing
to
do
.
<EOS>
I
went
in
for
three
minutes
,
and
was
detained
by
Miss
Bates
's
being
absent
.
<EOS>
She
was
out
;
and
I
felt
it
impossible
not
to
wait
till
she
came
in
.
<EOS>
She
is
a
woman
that
one
may
,
that
one
<EOS>
_
must
_
laugh
at
;
but
that
one
would
not
wish
to
slight
.
<EOS>
It
was
better
to
pay
my
visit
,
then
"
    
He
hesitated
,
got
up
,
walked
to
a
window
.
  
<EOS>
"
In
short
,
"
said
he
,
"
perhaps
,
Miss
Woodhouse
 
<EOS>
I
think
you
can
hardly
be
quite
without
suspicion
"
    
<EOS>
He
looked
at
her
,
as
if
wanting
to
read
her
thoughts
.
<EOS>
She
hardly
knew
what
to
say
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
like
the
forerunner
of
something
absolutely
serious
,
which
she
did
not
wish
.
<EOS>
Forcing
herself
to
speak
,
therefore
,
in
the
hope
of
putting
it
by
,
she
calmly
said
,
  
"
You
are
quite
in
the
right
;
it
was
most
natural
to
pay
your
visit
,
then
"
    
He
was
silent
.
<EOS>
She
believed
he
was
looking
at
her
;
probably
reflecting
on
what
she
had
said
,
and
trying
to
understand
the
manner
.
<EOS>
She
heard
him
sigh
.
<EOS>
It
was
natural
for
him
to
feel
that
he
had
_
cause
_
to
sigh
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
believe
her
to
be
encouraging
him
.
<EOS>
A
few
awkward
moments
passed
,
and
he
sat
down
again
;
and
in
a
more
determined
manner
said
,
  
"
It
was
something
to
feel
that
all
the
rest
of
my
time
might
be
given
to
Hartfield
.
<EOS>
My
regard
for
Hartfield
is
most
warm
"
    
<EOS>
He
stopt
again
,
rose
again
,
and
seemed
quite
embarrassed
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
more
in
love
with
her
than
Emma
had
supposed
;
and
who
can
say
how
it
might
have
ended
,
if
his
father
had
not
made
his
appearance
?
<EOS>
Mr.
Woodhouse
soon
followed
;
and
the
necessity
of
exertion
made
him
composed
.
  
<EOS>
A
very
few
minutes
more
,
however
,
completed
the
present
trial
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Weston
,
always
alert
when
business
was
to
be
done
,
and
as
incapable
of
procrastinating
any
evil
that
was
inevitable
,
as
of
foreseeing
any
that
was
doubtful
,
said
,
"
It
was
time
to
go
;
"
and
the
young
man
,
though
he
might
and
did
sigh
,
could
not
but
agree
,
to
take
leave
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
hear
about
you
all
,
"
said
he
;
"
that
is
my
chief
consolation
.
<EOS>
I
shall
hear
of
every
thing
that
is
going
on
among
you
.
<EOS>
I
have
engaged
Mrs.
Weston
to
correspond
with
me
.
<EOS>
She
has
been
so
kind
as
to
promise
it
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
the
blessing
of
a
female
correspondent
,
when
one
is
really
interested
in
the
absent
!
 
<EOS>
she
will
tell
me
every
thing
.
<EOS>
In
her
letters
I
shall
be
at
dear
Highbury
again
.
"
  
<EOS>
A
very
friendly
shake
of
the
hand
,
a
very
earnest
"
Good
-
bye
<EOS>
,
"
closed
the
speech
,
and
the
door
had
soon
shut
out
Frank
Churchill
.
<EOS>
Short
had
been
the
notice
 
short
their
meeting
;
he
was
gone
;
and
Emma
felt
so
sorry
to
part
,
and
foresaw
so
great
a
loss
to
their
little
society
from
his
absence
as
to
begin
to
be
afraid
of
being
too
sorry
,
and
feeling
it
too
much
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
sad
change
.
<EOS>
They
had
been
meeting
almost
every
day
since
his
arrival
.
<EOS>
Certainly
his
being
at
Randalls
had
given
great
spirit
to
the
last
two
weeks
 
indescribable
spirit
;
the
idea
,
the
expectation
of
seeing
him
which
every
morning
had
brought
,
the
assurance
of
his
attentions
,
his
liveliness
,
his
manners
!
<EOS>
It
had
been
a
very
happy
fortnight
,
and
forlorn
must
be
the
sinking
from
it
into
the
common
course
of
Hartfield
days
.
<EOS>
To
complete
every
other
recommendation
,
he
had
_
<EOS>
almost
_
told
her
that
he
loved
her
.
<EOS>
What
strength
,
or
what
constancy
of
affection
he
might
be
subject
to
,
was
another
point
;
but
at
present
she
could
not
doubt
his
having
a
decidedly
warm
admiration
,
a
conscious
preference
of
herself
;
and
this
persuasion
,
joined
to
all
the
rest
,
made
her
think
that
she
_
must
_
be
a
little
in
love
with
him
,
in
spite
of
every
previous
determination
against
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
certainly
must
,
"
said
she
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
This
sensation
of
listlessness
,
weariness
,
stupidity
,
this
disinclination
to
sit
down
and
employ
myself
,
this
feeling
of
every
thing
's
being
dull
and
insipid
about
the
house
!
  
<EOS>
I
must
be
in
love
;
I
should
be
the
oddest
creature
in
the
world
if
I
were
not
 
for
a
few
weeks
at
least
.
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
evil
to
some
is
always
good
to
others
.
<EOS>
I
shall
have
many
fellow
-
mourners
for
the
ball
,
if
not
for
Frank
Churchill
;
but
Mr.
Knightley
will
be
happy
.
<EOS>
He
may
spend
the
evening
with
his
dear
William
Larkins
now
if
he
likes
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Knightley
,
however
,
shewed
no
triumphant
happiness
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
say
that
he
was
sorry
on
his
own
account
;
his
very
cheerful
look
would
have
contradicted
him
if
he
had
;
but
he
said
,
and
very
steadily
,
that
he
was
sorry
for
the
disappointment
of
the
others
,
and
<EOS>
with
considerable
kindness
added
,
  
"
You
,
Emma
,
who
have
so
few
opportunities
of
dancing
,
you
are
really
out
of
luck
;
you
are
very
much
out
of
luck
!
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
some
days
before
she
saw
Jane
Fairfax
,
to
judge
of
her
honest
regret
in
this
woeful
change
;
but
when
they
did
meet
,
her
composure
was
odious
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
particularly
unwell
,
however
,
suffering
from
headache
to
a
degree
,
which
made
her
aunt
declare
,
that
had
the
ball
taken
place
,
she
did
not
think
Jane
could
have
attended
it
;
and
it
was
charity
to
impute
some
of
her
unbecoming
indifference
to
the
languor
of
ill
-
health
.
    
<EOS>
Emma
continued
to
entertain
no
doubt
of
her
being
in
love
.
<EOS>
Her
ideas
only
varied
as
to
the
how
much
.
<EOS>
At
first
,
she
thought
it
was
a
good
deal
;
and
afterwards
,
but
little
.
<EOS>
She
had
great
pleasure
in
hearing
Frank
Churchill
talked
of
;
and
,
for
his
sake
,
greater
pleasure
than
ever
in
seeing
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Weston
;
she
was
very
often
thinking
of
him
,
and
quite
impatient
for
a
letter
,
that
she
might
know
how
he
was
,
how
were
his
spirits
,
how
was
his
aunt
,
and
what
was
the
chance
of
his
coming
to
Randalls
again
this
spring
.
<EOS>
But
,
on
the
other
hand
,
she
could
not
admit
herself
to
be
unhappy
,
nor
,
after
the
first
morning
,
to
be
less
disposed
for
employment
than
usual
;
she
was
still
busy
and
cheerful
;
and
,
pleasing
as
he
was
,
she
could
yet
imagine
him
to
have
faults
;
and
farther
,
though
thinking
of
him
so
much
,
and
,
as
she
sat
drawing
or
working
,
forming
a
thousand
amusing
schemes
for
the
progress
and
close
of
their
attachment
,
fancying
interesting
dialogues
,
and
inventing
elegant
letters
;
the
conclusion
of
every
imaginary
declaration
on
his
side
was
that
she
_
refused
_
<EOS>
_
him
<EOS>
_
.
<EOS>
Their
affection
was
always
to
subside
into
friendship
.
<EOS>
Every
thing
tender
and
charming
was
to
mark
their
parting
;
but
still
they
were
to
part
.
<EOS>
When
she
became
sensible
of
this
,
it
struck
her
that
she
could
not
be
very
much
in
love
;
for
in
spite
of
her
previous
and
fixed
determination
never
to
quit
her
father
,
never
to
marry
,
a
strong
attachment
certainly
must
produce
more
of
a
struggle
than
she
could
foresee
in
her
own
feelings
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
find
myself
making
any
use
of
the
word
_
sacrifice
_
,
"
said
she
.
 
<EOS>
"
In
not
one
of
all
my
clever
replies
,
my
delicate
negatives
,
is
there
any
allusion
to
making
a
sacrifice
.
<EOS>
I
do
suspect
that
he
is
not
really
necessary
to
my
happiness
.
<EOS>
So
much
the
better
.
<EOS>
I
certainly
will
not
persuade
myself
to
feel
more
than
I
do
.
<EOS>
I
am
quite
enough
in
love
.
<EOS>
I
should
be
sorry
to
be
more
.
"
  
<EOS>
Upon
the
whole
,
she
was
equally
contented
with
her
view
of
his
feelings
.
  
<EOS>
"
_
He
_
is
undoubtedly
very
much
in
love
 
<EOS>
every
thing
denotes
it
 
very
much
in
love
indeed
!
 
<EOS>
and
when
he
comes
again
,
if
his
affection
continue
,
I
must
be
on
my
guard
not
to
encourage
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
be
most
inexcusable
to
do
otherwise
,
as
my
own
mind
is
quite
made
up
.
<EOS>
Not
that
I
imagine
he
can
think
I
have
been
encouraging
him
hitherto
.
<EOS>
No
,
if
he
had
believed
me
at
all
to
share
his
feelings
,
he
would
not
have
been
so
wretched
.
<EOS>
Could
he
have
thought
himself
encouraged
,
his
looks
and
language
at
parting
would
have
been
different
.
 
<EOS>
Still
,
however
,
I
must
be
on
my
guard
.
<EOS>
This
is
in
the
supposition
of
his
attachment
continuing
what
it
now
is
;
but
I
do
not
know
that
I
expect
it
will
;
I
do
not
look
upon
him
to
be
quite
the
sort
of
man
 
I
do
not
altogether
build
upon
his
steadiness
or
constancy
.
 
<EOS>
His
feelings
are
warm
,
but
I
can
imagine
them
rather
changeable
.
 
<EOS>
Every
consideration
of
the
subject
,
in
short
,
makes
me
thankful
that
my
happiness
is
not
more
deeply
involved
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
do
very
well
again
after
a
little
while
 
and
then
,
it
will
be
a
good
thing
over
;
for
they
say
every
body
is
in
love
once
in
their
lives
,
and
I
shall
have
been
let
off
easily
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
When
his
letter
to
Mrs.
Weston
arrived
,
Emma
had
the
perusal
of
it
;
and
she
read
it
with
a
degree
of
pleasure
and
admiration
which
made
her
at
first
shake
her
head
over
her
own
sensations
,
and
think
she
had
undervalued
their
strength
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
long
,
well
-
written
letter
,
giving
the
particulars
of
his
journey
and
of
his
feelings
,
expressing
all
the
affection
,
gratitude
,
and
respect
which
was
natural
and
honourable
,
and
describing
every
thing
exterior
and
local
that
could
be
supposed
attractive
,
with
spirit
and
precision
.
<EOS>
No
suspicious
flourishes
now
of
apology
or
concern
<EOS>
;
it
was
the
language
of
real
feeling
towards
Mrs.
Weston
;
and
the
transition
from
Highbury
to
Enscombe
,
the
contrast
between
the
places
in
some
of
the
first
blessings
of
social
life
was
just
enough
touched
on
to
shew
how
keenly
it
was
felt
,
and
how
much
more
might
have
been
said
but
for
the
restraints
of
propriety
.
 
<EOS>
The
charm
of
her
own
name
was
not
wanting
.
<EOS>
_
Miss
_
<EOS>
_
Woodhouse
_
appeared
more
than
once
,
and
never
without
a
something
of
pleasing
connexion
,
either
a
compliment
to
her
taste
,
or
a
remembrance
of
what
she
had
said
;
and
in
the
very
last
time
of
its
meeting
her
eye
,
unadorned
as
it
was
by
any
such
broad
wreath
of
gallantry
,
she
yet
could
discern
the
effect
of
her
influence
and
acknowledge
the
greatest
compliment
perhaps
of
all
conveyed
.
<EOS>
Compressed
into
the
very
lowest
vacant
corner
were
these
words
 
<EOS>
"
I
had
not
a
spare
moment
on
Tuesday
,
as
you
know
,
for
Miss
Woodhouse
's
beautiful
little
friend
.
<EOS>
Pray
make
my
excuses
and
adieus
to
her
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
This
,
Emma
could
not
doubt
,
was
all
for
herself
.
<EOS>
Harriet
was
remembered
only
from
being
_
her
_
friend
.
<EOS>
His
information
and
prospects
as
to
Enscombe
were
neither
worse
nor
better
than
had
been
anticipated
;
Mrs.
Churchill
was
recovering
,
and
he
dared
not
yet
,
even
in
his
own
imagination
,
fix
a
time
for
coming
to
Randalls
again
.
  
<EOS>
Gratifying
,
however
,
and
stimulative
as
was
the
letter
in
the
material
part
,
its
sentiments
<EOS>
,
she
yet
found
,
when
it
was
folded
up
and
returned
to
Mrs.
Weston
,
that
it
had
not
added
any
lasting
warmth
,
that
she
could
still
do
without
the
writer
,
and
that
he
must
learn
to
do
without
her
.
<EOS>
Her
intentions
were
unchanged
.
<EOS>
Her
resolution
of
refusal
only
grew
more
interesting
by
the
addition
of
a
scheme
for
his
subsequent
consolation
and
happiness
.
<EOS>
His
recollection
of
Harriet
,
and
the
words
which
clothed
it
,
the
"
beautiful
little
friend
,
"
suggested
to
her
the
idea
of
Harriet
's
succeeding
her
in
his
affections
.
<EOS>
Was
it
impossible
?
 
<EOS>
No
.
 
<EOS>
Harriet
undoubtedly
was
greatly
his
inferior
in
understanding
;
but
he
had
been
very
much
struck
with
the
loveliness
of
her
face
and
the
warm
simplicity
of
her
manner
;
and
all
the
probabilities
of
circumstance
and
connexion
were
in
her
favour
.
 
<EOS>
For
Harriet
,
it
would
be
advantageous
and
delightful
indeed
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
not
dwell
upon
it
,
"
said
she
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
must
not
think
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
know
the
danger
of
indulging
such
speculations
.
<EOS>
But
stranger
things
have
happened
;
and
when
we
cease
to
care
for
each
other
as
we
do
now
,
it
will
be
the
means
of
confirming
us
in
that
sort
of
true
disinterested
friendship
which
I
can
already
look
forward
to
with
pleasure
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
well
to
have
a
comfort
in
store
on
Harriet
's
behalf
,
though
it
might
be
wise
to
let
the
fancy
touch
it
seldom
;
for
evil
in
that
quarter
was
at
hand
.
<EOS>
As
Frank
Churchill
's
arrival
had
succeeded
Mr.
Elton
's
engagement
in
the
conversation
of
Highbury
,
as
the
latest
interest
had
entirely
borne
down
the
first
,
so
now
upon
Frank
Churchill
's
disappearance
,
Mr.
Elton
's
concerns
were
assuming
the
most
irresistible
form
.
 
<EOS>
His
wedding
-
day
was
named
.
<EOS>
He
would
soon
be
among
them
again
;
Mr.
Elton
and
his
bride
.
<EOS>
There
was
hardly
time
to
talk
over
the
first
letter
from
Enscombe
before
"
Mr.
Elton
and
his
bride
"
was
in
every
body
's
mouth
,
and
Frank
Churchill
was
forgotten
.
<EOS>
Emma
grew
sick
at
the
sound
.
<EOS>
She
had
had
three
weeks
of
happy
exemption
from
Mr.
Elton
;
and
<EOS>
Harriet
's
mind
,
she
had
been
willing
to
hope
,
had
been
lately
gaining
strength
.
<EOS>
With
Mr.
Weston
's
ball
in
view
at
least
,
there
had
been
a
great
deal
of
insensibility
to
other
things
;
but
it
was
now
too
evident
that
she
had
not
attained
such
a
state
of
composure
as
could
stand
against
the
actual
approach
 
new
carriage
,
bell
-
ringing
,
and
all
.
  
<EOS>
Poor
Harriet
was
in
a
flutter
of
spirits
which
required
all
the
reasonings
and
soothings
and
attentions
of
every
kind
that
Emma
could
give
.
<EOS>
Emma
felt
that
she
could
not
do
too
much
for
her
,
that
Harriet
had
a
right
to
all
her
ingenuity
and
all
her
patience
;
but
it
was
heavy
work
to
be
for
ever
convincing
without
producing
any
effect
,
for
ever
agreed
to
,
without
being
able
to
make
their
opinions
the
same
.
<EOS>
Harriet
listened
submissively
,
and
said
"
it
was
very
true
 
<EOS>
it
was
just
as
Miss
Woodhouse
described
 
<EOS>
it
was
not
worth
while
to
think
about
them
 
and
she
would
not
think
about
them
any
longer
"
but
no
change
of
subject
could
avail
,
and
the
next
half
-
hour
saw
her
as
anxious
and
restless
about
the
Eltons
as
before
.
<EOS>
At
last
Emma
attacked
her
on
another
ground
.
  
<EOS>
"
Your
allowing
yourself
to
be
so
occupied
and
so
unhappy
about
Mr.
Elton
's
marrying
,
Harriet
,
is
the
strongest
reproach
you
can
make
_
me
<EOS>
_
.
<EOS>
You
could
not
give
me
a
greater
reproof
for
the
mistake
I
fell
into
.
<EOS>
It
was
all
my
doing
,
I
know
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
forgotten
it
,
I
assure
you
.
 
<EOS>
Deceived
myself
,
I
did
very
miserably
deceive
you
 
and
it
will
be
a
painful
reflection
to
me
for
ever
.
<EOS>
Do
not
imagine
me
in
danger
of
forgetting
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Harriet
felt
this
too
much
to
utter
more
than
a
few
words
of
eager
exclamation
.
<EOS>
Emma
continued
,
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
said
,
exert
yourself
Harriet
for
my
sake
;
think
less
,
talk
less
of
Mr.
Elton
for
my
sake
;
because
for
your
own
sake
rather
,
I
would
wish
it
to
be
done
,
for
the
sake
of
what
is
more
important
than
my
comfort
,
a
habit
of
self
-
command
in
you
,
a
consideration
of
what
is
your
duty
,
an
attention
to
propriety
,
an
endeavour
to
avoid
the
suspicions
of
others
,
to
save
your
health
and
credit
,
and
restore
your
tranquillity
.
<EOS>
These
are
the
motives
which
I
have
been
pressing
on
you
.
<EOS>
They
are
very
important
 
and
sorry
I
am
that
you
can
not
feel
them
sufficiently
to
act
upon
them
.
<EOS>
My
being
saved
from
pain
is
a
very
secondary
consideration
.
<EOS>
I
want
you
to
save
yourself
from
greater
pain
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
I
may
sometimes
have
felt
that
Harriet
would
not
forget
what
was
due
 
or
rather
what
would
be
kind
by
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
This
appeal
to
her
affections
did
more
than
all
the
rest
.
<EOS>
The
idea
of
wanting
gratitude
and
consideration
for
Miss
Woodhouse
,
whom
she
really
loved
extremely
,
made
her
wretched
for
a
while
,
and
when
the
violence
of
grief
was
comforted
away
,
still
remained
powerful
enough
to
prompt
to
what
was
right
and
support
her
in
it
very
tolerably
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
,
who
have
been
the
best
friend
I
ever
had
in
my
life
 
Want
gratitude
to
you
!
 
<EOS>
Nobody
is
equal
to
you
!
 
<EOS>
I
care
for
nobody
as
I
do
for
you
!
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
Miss
Woodhouse
,
how
ungrateful
I
have
been
!
"
  
<EOS>
Such
expressions
,
assisted
as
they
were
by
every
thing
that
look
and
manner
could
do
,
made
Emma
feel
that
she
had
never
loved
Harriet
so
well
,
nor
valued
her
affection
so
highly
before
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
no
charm
equal
to
tenderness
of
heart
,
"
said
she
afterwards
to
herself
.
<EOS>
"
There
is
nothing
to
be
compared
to
it
.
<EOS>
Warmth
and
tenderness
of
heart
,
with
an
affectionate
,
open
manner
,
will
beat
all
the
clearness
of
head
in
the
world
,
for
attraction
<EOS>
,
I
am
sure
it
will
.
<EOS>
It
is
tenderness
of
heart
which
makes
my
dear
father
so
generally
beloved
 
which
gives
Isabella
all
her
popularity
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
it
not
 
<EOS>
but
I
know
how
to
prize
and
respect
it
.
 
<EOS>
Harriet
is
my
superior
in
all
the
charm
and
all
the
felicity
it
gives
.
<EOS>
Dear
Harriet
!
 
<EOS>
I
would
not
change
you
for
the
clearest
-
headed
,
longest
-
sighted
,
best
-
judging
female
breathing
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
the
coldness
of
a
Jane
Fairfax
!
 
<EOS>
Harriet
is
worth
a
hundred
such
 
<EOS>
And
for
a
wife
 
a
sensible
man
's
wife
 
it
is
invaluable
.
<EOS>
I
mention
no
names
;
but
happy
the
man
who
changes
Emma
for
Harriet
!
"
    
<EOS>
Mrs.
Elton
was
first
seen
at
church
:
but
though
devotion
might
be
interrupted
,
curiosity
could
not
be
satisfied
by
a
bride
in
a
pew
,
and
it
must
be
left
for
the
visits
in
form
which
were
then
to
be
paid
,
to
settle
whether
she
were
very
pretty
indeed
,
or
only
rather
pretty
,
or
not
pretty
at
all
.
  
<EOS>
Emma
had
feelings
,
less
of
curiosity
than
of
pride
or
propriety
,
to
make
her
resolve
on
not
being
the
last
to
pay
her
respects
;
and
she
made
a
point
of
Harriet
's
going
with
her
,
that
the
worst
of
the
business
might
be
gone
through
as
soon
as
possible
.
  
<EOS>
She
could
not
enter
the
house
again
,
could
not
be
in
the
same
room
to
which
she
had
with
such
vain
artifice
retreated
three
months
ago
,
to
lace
up
her
boot
,
without
_
recollecting
_
.
<EOS>
A
thousand
vexatious
thoughts
would
recur
.
<EOS>
Compliments
,
charades
,
and
horrible
blunders
;
and
it
was
not
to
be
supposed
that
poor
Harriet
should
not
be
recollecting
too
;
but
she
behaved
very
well
,
and
was
only
rather
pale
and
silent
.
<EOS>
The
visit
was
of
course
short
;
and
there
was
so
much
embarrassment
and
occupation
of
mind
to
shorten
it
,
that
Emma
would
not
allow
herself
entirely
to
form
an
opinion
of
the
lady
,
and
on
no
account
to
give
one
,
beyond
the
nothing
-
meaning
terms
of
being
"
elegantly
dressed
,
and
very
pleasing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
did
not
really
like
her
.
<EOS>
She
would
not
be
in
a
hurry
to
find
fault
,
but
she
suspected
that
there
was
no
elegance
;
 
ease
,
but
not
elegance
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
almost
sure
that
for
a
young
woman
,
a
stranger
,
a
bride
,
there
was
too
much
ease
.
<EOS>
Her
person
was
rather
good
;
her
face
not
unpretty
;
but
neither
feature
,
nor
air
,
nor
voice
,
nor
manner
,
were
elegant
.
<EOS>
Emma
thought
at
least
it
would
turn
out
so
.
  
<EOS>
As
for
Mr.
Elton
,
his
manners
did
not
appear
 
<EOS>
but
no
,
she
would
not
permit
a
hasty
or
a
witty
word
from
herself
about
his
manners
.
<EOS>
It
was
an
awkward
ceremony
at
any
time
to
be
receiving
wedding
visits
,
and
a
man
had
need
be
all
grace
to
acquit
himself
well
through
it
.
<EOS>
The
woman
was
better
off
;
she
might
have
the
assistance
of
fine
clothes
,
and
the
privilege
of
bashfulness
,
but
the
man
had
only
his
own
good
sense
to
depend
on
;
and
when
she
considered
how
peculiarly
unlucky
poor
Mr.
Elton
was
in
being
in
the
same
room
at
once
with
the
woman
he
had
just
married
,
the
woman
he
had
wanted
to
marry
,
and
the
woman
whom
he
had
been
expected
to
marry
,
she
must
allow
him
to
have
the
right
to
look
as
little
wise
,
and
to
be
as
much
affectedly
,
and
as
little
really
easy
as
could
be
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Miss
Woodhouse
,
"
said
Harriet
,
when
they
had
quitted
the
house
,
and
after
waiting
in
vain
for
her
friend
to
begin
;
"
<EOS>
Well
,
Miss
Woodhouse
,
(
with
a
gentle
sigh
,
)
<EOS>
what
do
you
think
of
her
?
 
<EOS>
Is
not
she
very
charming
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
little
hesitation
in
Emma
's
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
yes
 
<EOS>
very
 
a
very
pleasing
young
woman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
her
beautiful
,
quite
beautiful
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
nicely
dressed
,
indeed
;
a
remarkably
elegant
gown
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
at
all
surprized
that
he
should
have
fallen
in
love
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
no
 
<EOS>
there
is
nothing
to
surprize
one
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
A
pretty
fortune
;
and
she
came
in
his
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
dare
say
,
"
returned
Harriet
,
sighing
again
,
"
I
dare
say
she
was
very
much
attached
to
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
she
might
;
but
it
is
not
every
man
's
fate
to
marry
the
woman
who
loves
him
best
.
<EOS>
Miss
Hawkins
perhaps
wanted
a
home
,
and
thought
this
the
best
offer
<EOS>
she
was
likely
to
have
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Harriet
earnestly
,
"
<EOS>
and
well
she
might
,
nobody
could
ever
have
a
better
.
<EOS>
Well
,
I
wish
them
happy
with
all
my
heart
.
<EOS>
And
now
,
Miss
Woodhouse
,
I
do
not
think
I
shall
mind
seeing
them
again
.
<EOS>
He
is
just
as
superior
as
ever
;
 
but
being
married
,
you
know
,
it
is
quite
a
different
thing
.
<EOS>
No
,
indeed
,
Miss
Woodhouse
,
you
need
not
be
afraid
;
I
can
sit
and
admire
him
now
without
any
great
misery
.
<EOS>
To
know
that
he
has
not
thrown
himself
away
,
is
such
a
comfort
!
 
<EOS>
She
does
seem
a
charming
young
woman
,
just
what
he
deserves
.
<EOS>
Happy
creature
!
<EOS>
He
called
her
"
Augusta
.
"
<EOS>
How
delightful
!
"
  
<EOS>
When
the
visit
was
returned
,
Emma
made
up
her
mind
.
<EOS>
She
could
then
see
more
and
judge
better
.
<EOS>
From
Harriet
's
happening
not
to
be
at
Hartfield
,
and
her
father
's
being
present
to
engage
Mr.
Elton
,
she
had
a
quarter
of
an
hour
of
the
lady
's
conversation
to
herself
,
and
could
composedly
attend
to
her
;
and
the
quarter
of
an
hour
quite
convinced
her
that
Mrs.
Elton
was
a
vain
woman
,
extremely
well
satisfied
with
herself
,
and
thinking
much
of
her
own
importance
;
that
she
meant
to
shine
and
be
very
superior
,
but
with
manners
which
had
been
formed
in
a
bad
school
,
pert
and
familiar
;
that
all
her
notions
were
drawn
from
one
set
of
people
,
and
one
style
of
living
;
that
if
not
foolish
she
was
ignorant
,
and
that
her
society
would
certainly
do
Mr.
Elton
<EOS>
no
good
.
  
<EOS>
Harriet
would
have
been
a
better
match
.
<EOS>
If
not
wise
or
refined
herself
,
she
would
have
connected
him
with
those
who
were
;
but
Miss
Hawkins
,
it
might
be
fairly
supposed
from
her
easy
conceit
,
had
been
the
best
of
her
own
set
.
<EOS>
The
rich
brother
-
in
-
law
near
Bristol
was
the
pride
of
the
alliance
,
and
his
place
and
his
carriages
were
the
pride
of
him
.
  
<EOS>
The
very
first
subject
after
being
seated
was
Maple
Grove
,
"
<EOS>
My
brother
Mr.
Suckling
's
seat
;
"
 
a
comparison
of
Hartfield
to
Maple
Grove
.
<EOS>
The
grounds
of
Hartfield
were
small
,
but
neat
and
pretty
;
and
the
house
was
modern
and
well
-
built
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Elton
seemed
most
favourably
impressed
by
the
size
of
the
room
,
the
entrance
,
and
all
that
she
could
see
or
imagine
.
"
<EOS>
Very
like
Maple
Grove
indeed
!
 
<EOS>
She
was
quite
struck
by
the
likeness
!
 
<EOS>
That
room
was
the
very
shape
and
size
of
the
morning
-
room
at
Maple
Grove
;
her
sister
's
favourite
room
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Elton
was
appealed
to
.
 
<EOS>
"
Was
not
it
astonishingly
like
?
 
<EOS>
She
could
really
almost
fancy
herself
at
Maple
Grove
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
the
staircase
 
<EOS>
You
know
,
as
I
came
in
,
I
observed
how
very
like
the
staircase
was
;
placed
exactly
in
the
same
part
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
I
really
could
not
help
exclaiming
!
<EOS>
I
assure
you
,
Miss
Woodhouse
,
it
is
very
delightful
to
me
,
to
be
reminded
of
a
place
I
am
so
extremely
partial
to
as
Maple
Grove
.
<EOS>
I
have
spent
so
many
happy
months
there
!
<EOS>
(
with
a
little
sigh
of
sentiment
)
.
<EOS>
A
charming
place
,
undoubtedly
.
<EOS>
Every
body
who
sees
it
is
struck
by
its
beauty
;
but
to
me
,
it
has
been
quite
a
home
.
<EOS>
Whenever
you
are
transplanted
,
like
me
,
Miss
Woodhouse
,
you
will
understand
how
very
delightful
it
is
to
meet
with
any
thing
at
all
like
what
one
has
left
behind
.
<EOS>
I
always
say
this
is
quite
one
of
the
evils
of
matrimony
.
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
made
as
slight
a
reply
as
she
could
;
but
it
was
fully
sufficient
for
Mrs.
Elton
,
who
only
wanted
to
be
talking
herself
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
extremely
like
Maple
Grove
!
<EOS>
And
it
is
not
merely
the
house
 
<EOS>
the
grounds
<EOS>
,
I
assure
you
,
as
far
as
I
could
observe
,
are
strikingly
like
.
<EOS>
The
laurels
at
Maple
Grove
are
in
the
same
profusion
as
here
,
and
stand
very
much
in
the
same
way
 
just
across
the
lawn
;
and
I
had
a
glimpse
of
a
fine
large
tree
,
with
a
bench
round
it
,
which
put
me
so
exactly
in
mind
!
<EOS>
My
brother
and
sister
will
be
enchanted
with
this
place
.
<EOS>
People
who
have
extensive
grounds
<EOS>
themselves
are
always
pleased
with
any
thing
in
the
same
style
.
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
doubted
the
truth
of
this
sentiment
.
<EOS>
She
had
a
great
idea
that
people
who
had
extensive
grounds
themselves
cared
very
little
for
the
extensive
grounds
of
any
body
else
;
but
it
was
not
worth
while
to
attack
an
error
so
double
-
dyed
,
and
therefore
only
said
in
reply
,
  
<EOS>
"
When
you
have
seen
more
of
this
country
,
I
am
afraid
you
will
think
you
have
overrated
Hartfield
.
<EOS>
Surry
is
full
of
beauties
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
yes
,
I
am
quite
aware
of
that
.
<EOS>
It
is
the
garden
of
England
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
Surry
is
the
garden
of
England
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
;
but
we
must
not
rest
our
claims
on
that
distinction
.
<EOS>
Many
counties
,
I
believe
,
are
called
the
garden
of
England
,
as
well
as
Surry
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
fancy
not
,
"
replied
Mrs.
Elton
,
with
a
most
satisfied
smile
.
<EOS>
"
I
never
heard
any
county
but
Surry
called
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
was
silenced
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
brother
and
sister
have
promised
us
a
visit
in
the
spring
,
or
summer
at
farthest
,
"
continued
Mrs.
Elton
;
"
and
that
will
be
our
time
for
exploring
.
<EOS>
While
they
are
with
us
,
we
shall
explore
a
great
deal
,
I
dare
say
.
<EOS>
They
will
have
their
barouche
-
landau
,
of
course
,
which
holds
four
perfectly
;
and
therefore
,
without
saying
any
thing
of
_
our
_
carriage
,
we
should
be
able
to
explore
the
different
beauties
extremely
well
.
<EOS>
They
would
hardly
come
in
their
chaise
,
I
think
,
at
that
season
of
the
year
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
when
the
time
draws
on
,
I
shall
decidedly
recommend
their
bringing
the
barouche
-
landau
;
it
will
be
so
very
much
preferable
.
<EOS>
When
people
come
into
a
beautiful
country
of
this
sort
,
you
know
,
Miss
Woodhouse
,
one
naturally
wishes
them
to
see
as
much
as
possible
;
and
Mr.
Suckling
is
extremely
fond
of
exploring
.
<EOS>
We
explored
to
King's
-
Weston
twice
last
summer
,
in
that
way
,
most
delightfully
,
just
after
their
first
having
the
barouche
-
landau
.
<EOS>
You
have
many
parties
of
that
kind
here
,
I
suppose
,
Miss
Woodhouse
,
every
summer
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
not
immediately
here
.
<EOS>
We
are
rather
out
of
distance
of
the
very
striking
beauties
which
attract
the
sort
of
parties
you
speak
of
;
and
we
are
a
very
quiet
set
of
people
,
I
believe
;
more
disposed
to
stay
at
home
than
engage
in
schemes
of
pleasure
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
there
is
nothing
like
staying
at
home
for
real
comfort
.
<EOS>
Nobody
can
be
more
devoted
to
home
than
I
am
.
<EOS>
I
was
quite
a
proverb
for
it
at
Maple
Grove
.
<EOS>
Many
a
time
has
Selina
said
,
when
she
has
been
going
to
Bristol
,
"
I
really
can
not
get
this
girl
to
move
from
the
house
.
<EOS>
I
absolutely
must
go
in
by
myself
,
though
I
hate
being
stuck
up
in
the
barouche
-
landau
without
a
companion
;
but
Augusta
,
I
believe
,
with
her
own
good
-
will
,
would
never
stir
beyond
the
park
paling
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Many
a
time
has
she
said
so
;
and
yet
I
am
no
advocate
for
entire
seclusion
.
<EOS>
I
think
,
on
the
contrary
,
when
people
shut
themselves
up
entirely
from
society
,
it
is
a
very
bad
thing
;
and
that
it
is
much
more
advisable
to
mix
in
the
world
in
a
proper
degree
,
without
living
in
it
either
too
much
or
too
little
.
<EOS>
I
perfectly
understand
your
situation
,
however
,
Miss
Woodhouse
 
<EOS>
(
looking
towards
Mr.
Woodhouse
)
,
Your
father
's
state
of
health
must
be
a
great
drawback
.
<EOS>
Why
does
not
he
try
Bath
?
 
<EOS>
Indeed
he
should
.
<EOS>
Let
me
recommend
Bath
to
you
.
<EOS>
I
assure
you
I
have
no
doubt
of
its
doing
Mr.
Woodhouse
good
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
father
tried
it
more
than
once
,
formerly
;
but
without
receiving
any
benefit
;
and
Mr.
Perry
,
whose
name
,
I
dare
say
,
is
not
unknown
to
you
,
does
not
conceive
it
would
be
at
all
more
likely
to
be
useful
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
that
's
a
great
pity
;
for
I
assure
you
,
Miss
Woodhouse
,
where
the
waters
do
agree
,
it
is
quite
wonderful
the
relief
they
give
.
<EOS>
In
my
Bath
life
,
I
have
seen
such
instances
of
it
!
<EOS>
And
it
is
so
cheerful
a
place
,
that
it
could
not
fail
of
being
of
use
to
Mr.
Woodhouse
's
spirits
,
which
,
I
understand
,
are
sometimes
much
depressed
.
<EOS>
And
as
to
its
recommendations
to
_
<EOS>
you
_
,
<EOS>
I
fancy
<EOS>
I
need
not
take
much
pains
to
dwell
on
them
.
<EOS>
The
advantages
of
Bath
to
the
young
are
pretty
generally
understood
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
a
charming
introduction
for
you
,
who
have
lived
so
secluded
a
life
;
and
I
could
immediately
secure
you
some
of
the
best
society
in
the
place
.
<EOS>
A
line
from
me
would
bring
you
a
little
host
of
acquaintance
;
and
my
particular
friend
,
Mrs.
Partridge
,
the
lady
I
have
always
resided
with
when
in
Bath
,
would
be
most
happy
to
shew
you
any
attentions
,
and
would
be
the
very
person
for
you
to
go
into
public
with
.
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
as
much
as
Emma
could
bear
,
without
being
impolite
.
<EOS>
The
idea
of
her
being
indebted
to
Mrs.
Elton
for
what
was
called
an
_
introduction
_
 
of
her
going
into
public
under
the
auspices
of
a
friend
of
Mrs.
Elton
's
 
probably
some
vulgar
,
dashing
widow
,
who
,
with
the
help
of
a
boarder
,
just
made
a
shift
to
live
!
 
<EOS>
The
dignity
of
Miss
Woodhouse
,
of
Hartfield
,
was
sunk
indeed
!
  
<EOS>
She
restrained
herself
,
however
,
from
any
of
the
reproofs
she
could
have
given
,
and
only
thanked
Mrs.
Elton
coolly
;
"
but
their
going
to
Bath
was
quite
out
of
the
question
;
and
she
was
not
perfectly
convinced
that
the
place
might
suit
her
better
than
her
father
.
"
<EOS>
And
then
,
to
prevent
farther
outrage
and
indignation
,
changed
the
subject
directly
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
ask
whether
you
are
musical
,
Mrs.
Elton
.
<EOS>
Upon
these
occasions
,
a
lady
's
character
generally
precedes
her
;
and
Highbury
has
long
known
that
you
are
a
superior
performer
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Oh
!
no
,
indeed
;
I
must
protest
against
any
such
idea
.
<EOS>
A
superior
performer
!
 
<EOS>
very
far
from
it
,
I
assure
you
.
<EOS>
Consider
from
how
partial
a
quarter
your
information
came
.
<EOS>
I
am
doatingly
fond
of
music
 
passionately
fond
;
 
and
my
friends
say
I
am
not
entirely
devoid
of
taste
;
but
as
to
any
thing
else
,
upon
my
honour
my
performance
is
_
mediocre
_
to
the
last
degree
.
<EOS>
You
,
Miss
Woodhouse
,
I
well
know
,
play
delightfully
.
<EOS>
I
assure
you
it
has
been
the
greatest
satisfaction
,
comfort
,
and
delight
to
me
,
to
hear
what
a
musical
society
I
am
got
into
.
<EOS>
I
absolutely
can
not
do
without
music
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
necessary
of
life
to
me
;
and
having
always
been
used
to
a
very
musical
society
,
both
at
Maple
Grove
and
in
Bath
,
it
would
have
been
a
most
serious
sacrifice
.
<EOS>
I
honestly
said
as
much
to
Mr.
E.
when
he
was
speaking
of
my
future
home
,
and
expressing
his
fears
lest
the
retirement
of
it
should
be
disagreeable
;
and
the
inferiority
of
the
house
too
 
knowing
what
I
had
been
accustomed
to
 
of
course
<EOS>
he
was
not
wholly
without
apprehension
.
<EOS>
When
he
was
speaking
of
it
in
that
way
,
I
honestly
said
that
_
the
_
_
world
<EOS>
_
I
could
give
up
 
parties
,
balls
,
plays
 
for
I
had
no
fear
of
retirement
.
<EOS>
Blessed
with
so
many
resources
within
myself
,
the
world
was
not
necessary
to
_
me
<EOS>
_
.
<EOS>
I
could
do
very
well
without
it
.
<EOS>
To
those
who
had
no
resources
it
was
a
different
thing
;
but
my
resources
made
me
quite
independent
.
<EOS>
And
as
to
smaller
-
sized
rooms
than
I
had
been
used
to
,
I
really
could
not
give
it
a
thought
.
<EOS>
I
hoped
I
was
perfectly
equal
to
any
sacrifice
of
that
description
.
<EOS>
Certainly
I
had
been
accustomed
to
every
luxury
at
Maple
Grove
;
but
I
did
assure
him
that
two
carriages
were
not
necessary
to
my
happiness
,
nor
were
spacious
apartments
.
<EOS>
"
But
,
"
said
I
,
"
to
be
quite
honest
,
I
do
not
think
I
can
live
without
something
of
a
musical
society
.
<EOS>
I
condition
for
nothing
else
;
but
without
music
,
life
would
be
a
blank
to
me
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
"
We
can
not
suppose
,
"
said
Emma
,
smiling
,
"
that
Mr.
Elton
would
hesitate
to
assure
you
of
there
being
a
_
<EOS>
very
_
musical
society
in
Highbury
;
and
I
hope
you
will
not
find
he
has
outstepped
the
truth
more
than
may
be
pardoned
,
in
consideration
of
the
motive
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
indeed
,
I
have
no
doubts
at
all
on
that
head
.
<EOS>
I
am
delighted
to
find
myself
in
such
a
circle
.
<EOS>
I
hope
we
shall
have
many
sweet
little
concerts
together
.
<EOS>
I
think
,
Miss
Woodhouse
,
you
and
I
must
establish
a
musical
club
,
and
have
regular
weekly
meetings
at
your
house
,
or
ours
.
<EOS>
Will
not
it
be
a
good
plan
?
<EOS>
If
_
<EOS>
we
_
exert
ourselves
<EOS>
,
I
think
we
shall
not
be
long
in
want
of
allies
.
<EOS>
Something
of
that
nature
would
be
particularly
desirable
for
_
me
_
,
as
an
inducement
to
keep
me
in
practice
;
for
married
women
,
you
know
 
there
is
a
sad
story
against
them
,
in
general
.
<EOS>
They
are
but
too
apt
to
give
up
music
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
,
who
are
so
extremely
fond
of
it
 
there
can
be
no
danger
,
surely
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
hope
not
;
but
really
when
I
look
around
among
my
acquaintance
,
I
tremble
.
<EOS>
Selina
has
entirely
given
up
music
 
never
touches
the
instrument
 
though
she
played
sweetly
.
<EOS>
And
the
same
may
be
said
of
Mrs.
Jeffereys
 
Clara
Partridge
,
that
was
 
and
of
the
two
Milmans
,
now
Mrs.
Bird
and
Mrs.
James
Cooper
;
and
of
more
than
I
can
enumerate
.
<EOS>
Upon
my
word
it
is
enough
to
put
one
in
a
fright
.
<EOS>
I
used
to
be
quite
angry
with
Selina
;
but
really
I
begin
now
to
comprehend
that
a
married
woman
has
many
things
to
call
her
attention
.
<EOS>
I
believe
I
was
half
an
hour
this
morning
shut
up
with
my
housekeeper
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
But
every
thing
of
that
kind
,
"
said
Emma
,
"
will
soon
be
in
so
regular
a
train
 
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
said
Mrs.
Elton
,
laughing
,
"
we
shall
see
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
,
finding
her
so
determined
upon
neglecting
her
music
,
had
nothing
more
to
say
;
and
,
after
a
moment
's
pause
,
Mrs.
Elton
chose
another
subject
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
have
been
calling
at
Randalls
,
"
said
she
,
"
and
found
them
both
at
home
;
and
very
pleasant
people
they
seem
to
be
.
<EOS>
I
like
them
extremely
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Weston
seems
an
excellent
creature
 
quite
a
first
-
rate
favourite
with
me
already
,
I
assure
you
.
<EOS>
And
_
she
_
appears
so
truly
good
 
<EOS>
there
is
something
so
motherly
and
kind
-
hearted
about
her
,
that
it
wins
upon
one
directly
.
<EOS>
She
was
your
governess
,
I
think
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
was
almost
too
much
astonished
to
answer
;
but
Mrs.
Elton
hardly
waited
for
the
affirmative
before
she
went
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
Having
understood
as
much
,
I
was
rather
astonished
to
find
her
so
very
lady
-
like
!
<EOS>
But
she
is
really
quite
the
gentlewoman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Weston
's
manners
,
"
said
Emma
,
"
were
always
particularly
good
.
<EOS>
Their
propriety
,
simplicity
,
and
elegance
,
would
make
them
the
safest
model
for
any
young
woman
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
who
do
you
think
came
in
while
we
were
there
?
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
was
quite
at
a
loss
.
<EOS>
The
tone
implied
some
old
acquaintance
 
and
how
could
she
possibly
guess
?
  
<EOS>
"
Knightley
!
<EOS>
"
continued
Mrs.
Elton
;
"
Knightley
himself
!
 
<EOS>
Was
not
it
lucky
?
 
<EOS>
for
,
not
being
within
when
he
called
the
other
day
,
I
had
never
seen
him
before
;
and
of
course
,
as
so
particular
a
friend
of
Mr.
E."s
,
I
had
a
great
curiosity
.
<EOS>
"
My
friend
Knightley
'
had
been
so
often
mentioned
,
that
I
was
really
impatient
to
see
him
;
and
I
must
do
my
caro
sposo
the
justice
to
say
that
he
need
not
be
ashamed
of
his
friend
.
<EOS>
Knightley
is
quite
the
gentleman
.
<EOS>
I
like
him
very
much
.
<EOS>
Decidedly
,
I
think
,
a
very
gentleman
-
like
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Happily
,
it
was
now
time
to
be
gone
.
<EOS>
They
were
off
;
and
Emma
could
breathe
.
  
<EOS>
"
Insufferable
woman
!
<EOS>
"
was
her
immediate
exclamation
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Worse
than
I
had
supposed
.
<EOS>
Absolutely
insufferable
!
<EOS>
Knightley
!
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
have
believed
it
.
<EOS>
Knightley
!
 
<EOS>
never
seen
him
in
her
life
before
,
and
call
him
Knightley
!
 
and
discover
that
he
is
a
gentleman
!
<EOS>
A
little
upstart
,
vulgar
being
,
with
her
Mr.
E.
,
and
her
_
caro
_
<EOS>
_
sposo
_
,
and
her
resources
,
and
all
her
airs
of
pert
pretension
and
underbred
finery
.
<EOS>
Actually
to
discover
that
Mr.
Knightley
is
a
gentleman
!
<EOS>
I
doubt
whether
he
will
return
the
compliment
,
and
discover
her
to
be
a
lady
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
have
believed
it
!
<EOS>
And
to
propose
that
she
and
I
should
unite
to
form
a
musical
club
!
<EOS>
One
would
fancy
we
were
bosom
friends
!
<EOS>
And
Mrs.
Weston
!
 
<EOS>
Astonished
that
the
person
who
had
brought
me
up
should
be
a
gentlewoman
!
<EOS>
Worse
and
worse
.
<EOS>
I
never
met
with
her
equal
.
<EOS>
Much
beyond
my
hopes
.
<EOS>
Harriet
is
disgraced
by
any
comparison
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
what
would
Frank
Churchill
say
to
her
,
if
he
were
here
?
<EOS>
How
angry
and
how
diverted
he
would
be
!
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
there
I
am
 
thinking
of
him
directly
.
<EOS>
Always
the
first
person
to
be
thought
of
!
<EOS>
How
I
catch
myself
out
!
<EOS>
Frank
Churchill
comes
as
regularly
into
my
mind
!
"
    
<EOS>
All
this
ran
so
glibly
through
her
thoughts
,
that
by
the
time
her
father
had
arranged
himself
,
after
the
bustle
of
the
Eltons
'
departure
,
and
was
ready
to
speak
,
she
was
very
tolerably
capable
of
attending
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
my
dear
,
"
he
deliberately
began
,
"
considering
we
never
saw
her
before
,
she
seems
a
very
pretty
sort
of
young
lady
;
and
I
dare
say
she
was
very
much
pleased
with
you
.
<EOS>
She
speaks
a
little
too
quick
.
<EOS>
A
little
quickness
of
voice
there
is
which
rather
hurts
the
ear
.
<EOS>
But
I
believe
I
am
nice
;
I
do
not
like
strange
voices
;
and
nobody
speaks
like
you
and
poor
Miss
Taylor
.
<EOS>
However
,
she
seems
a
very
obliging
,
pretty
-
behaved
young
lady
,
and
no
doubt
will
make
him
a
very
good
wife
.
<EOS>
Though
I
think
he
had
better
not
have
married
.
<EOS>
I
made
the
best
excuses
I
could
for
not
having
been
able
to
wait
on
him
and
Mrs.
Elton
on
this
happy
occasion
;
I
said
that
I
hoped
I
_
<EOS>
should
_
<EOS>
in
the
course
of
the
summer
.
<EOS>
But
I
ought
to
have
gone
before
.
<EOS>
Not
to
wait
upon
a
bride
is
very
remiss
.
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
it
shews
what
a
sad
invalid
I
am
!
<EOS>
But
I
do
not
like
the
corner
into
Vicarage
Lane
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
dare
say
your
apologies
were
accepted
,
sir
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Elton
knows
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
:
but
a
young
lady
 
<EOS>
a
bride
 
<EOS>
I
ought
to
have
paid
my
respects
to
her
if
possible
.
<EOS>
It
was
being
very
deficient
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
my
dear
papa
,
you
are
no
friend
to
matrimony
;
and
therefore
why
should
you
be
so
anxious
to
pay
your
respects
to
a
_
bride
_
?
<EOS>
It
ought
to
be
no
recommendation
to
_
you
_
.
<EOS>
It
is
encouraging
people
to
marry
if
you
make
so
much
of
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
my
dear
,
I
never
encouraged
any
body
to
marry
,
but
I
would
always
wish
to
pay
every
proper
attention
to
a
lady
 
and
a
bride
,
especially
,
is
never
to
be
neglected
.
<EOS>
More
is
avowedly
due
to
_
her
_
.
<EOS>
A
bride
,
you
know
,
my
dear
,
is
always
the
first
in
company
,
let
the
others
be
who
they
may
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
papa
,
if
this
is
not
encouragement
to
marry
,
I
do
not
know
what
is
.
<EOS>
And
I
should
never
have
expected
you
to
be
lending
your
sanction
to
such
vanity
-
baits
for
poor
young
ladies
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
you
do
not
understand
me
.
<EOS>
This
is
a
matter
of
mere
common
politeness
and
good
-
breeding
,
and
has
nothing
to
do
with
any
encouragement
to
people
to
marry
.
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
had
done
.
<EOS>
Her
father
was
growing
nervous
,
and
could
not
understand
_
<EOS>
her
_
.
<EOS>
Her
mind
returned
to
Mrs.
Elton
's
offences
,
and
long
,
very
long
,
did
they
occupy
her
.
    
<EOS>
Emma
was
not
required
,
by
any
subsequent
discovery
,
to
retract
her
ill
opinion
of
Mrs.
Elton
.
<EOS>
Her
observation
had
been
pretty
correct
.
<EOS>
Such
as
Mrs.
Elton
appeared
to
her
on
this
second
interview
,
such
she
appeared
whenever
they
met
again
,
 
self
-
important
,
presuming
,
familiar
,
ignorant
,
and
ill
-
bred
.
<EOS>
She
had
a
little
beauty
and
a
little
accomplishment
,
but
so
little
judgment
that
she
thought
herself
coming
with
superior
knowledge
of
the
world
,
to
enliven
and
improve
a
country
neighbourhood
;
and
conceived
Miss
Hawkins
to
have
held
such
a
place
in
society
as
Mrs.
Elton
's
consequence
only
could
surpass
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
no
reason
to
suppose
Mr.
Elton
thought
at
all
differently
from
his
wife
.
<EOS>
He
seemed
not
merely
happy
with
her
,
but
proud
.
<EOS>
He
had
the
air
of
congratulating
himself
on
having
brought
such
a
woman
to
Highbury
,
as
not
even
Miss
Woodhouse
could
equal
;
and
the
greater
part
of
her
new
acquaintance
,
disposed
to
commend
,
or
not
in
the
habit
of
judging
,
following
the
lead
of
Miss
Bates
's
good
-
will
,
or
taking
it
for
granted
that
the
bride
must
be
as
clever
and
as
agreeable
as
she
professed
herself
,
were
very
well
satisfied
;
so
that
Mrs.
Elton
's
praise
passed
from
one
mouth
to
another
as
it
ought
to
do
,
unimpeded
by
Miss
Woodhouse
,
who
readily
continued
her
first
contribution
and
talked
with
a
good
grace
of
her
being
"
very
pleasant
and
very
elegantly
dressed
.
"
  
<EOS>
In
one
respect
Mrs.
Elton
grew
even
worse
than
she
had
appeared
at
first
.
<EOS>
Her
feelings
altered
towards
Emma
.
 
<EOS>
Offended
,
probably
,
by
the
little
encouragement
which
her
proposals
of
intimacy
met
with
<EOS>
,
she
drew
back
in
her
turn
and
gradually
became
much
more
cold
and
distant
;
and
though
the
effect
was
agreeable
,
the
ill
-
will
which
produced
it
was
necessarily
increasing
Emma
's
dislike
.
<EOS>
Her
manners
,
too
 
and
Mr.
Elton
's
,
were
unpleasant
towards
Harriet
.
<EOS>
They
were
sneering
and
negligent
.
<EOS>
Emma
hoped
it
must
rapidly
work
Harriet
's
cure
;
but
the
sensations
which
could
prompt
such
behaviour
sunk
them
both
very
much
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
to
be
doubted
that
poor
Harriet
's
attachment
had
been
an
offering
to
conjugal
unreserve
,
and
her
own
share
in
the
story
,
under
a
colouring
the
least
favourable
to
her
and
the
most
soothing
to
him
,
had
in
all
likelihood
been
given
also
.
<EOS>
She
was
,
of
course
,
the
object
of
their
joint
dislike
.
 
<EOS>
When
they
had
nothing
else
to
say
,
it
must
be
always
easy
to
begin
abusing
Miss
Woodhouse
;
and
the
enmity
which
they
dared
not
shew
in
open
disrespect
to
her
,
found
a
broader
vent
in
contemptuous
treatment
of
Harriet
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Elton
took
a
great
fancy
to
Jane
Fairfax
;
and
from
the
first
.
<EOS>
Not
merely
when
a
state
of
warfare
with
one
young
lady
might
be
supposed
to
recommend
the
other
,
but
from
the
very
first
;
and
she
was
not
satisfied
with
expressing
a
natural
and
reasonable
admiration
 
but
without
solicitation
,
or
plea
,
or
privilege
,
she
must
be
wanting
to
assist
and
befriend
her
.
 
<EOS>
Before
Emma
had
forfeited
her
confidence
,
and
about
the
third
time
of
their
meeting
,
she
heard
all
Mrs.
Elton
's
knight
-
errantry
on
the
subject
.
    
<EOS>
"
Jane
Fairfax
is
absolutely
charming
,
Miss
Woodhouse
.
 
<EOS>
I
quite
rave
about
Jane
Fairfax
.
 
<EOS>
A
sweet
,
interesting
creature
.
<EOS>
So
mild
and
ladylike
 
and
with
such
talents
!
 
<EOS>
I
assure
you
<EOS>
I
think
she
has
very
extraordinary
talents
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
scruple
to
say
that
she
plays
extremely
well
.
<EOS>
I
know
enough
of
music
to
speak
decidedly
on
that
point
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
she
is
absolutely
charming
!
<EOS>
You
will
laugh
at
my
warmth
 
but
,
upon
my
word
,
I
talk
of
nothing
but
Jane
Fairfax
.
 
<EOS>
And
her
situation
is
so
calculated
to
affect
one
!
 
<EOS>
Miss
Woodhouse
,
we
must
exert
ourselves
and
endeavour
to
do
something
for
her
.
<EOS>
We
must
bring
her
forward
.
<EOS>
Such
talent
as
hers
must
not
be
suffered
to
remain
unknown
.
 
<EOS>
I
dare
say
you
have
heard
those
charming
lines
of
the
poet
,
  
<EOS>
"
Full
many
a
flower
is
born
to
blush
unseen
,
"
And
waste
its
fragrance
on
the
desert
air
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
We
must
not
allow
them
to
be
verified
in
sweet
Jane
Fairfax
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
think
there
is
any
danger
of
it
,
"
was
Emma
's
calm
answer
 
"
and
when
you
are
better
acquainted
with
Miss
Fairfax
's
situation
and
understand
what
her
home
has
been
,
with
Colonel
and
Mrs.
Campbell
,
I
have
no
idea
that
you
will
suppose
her
talents
can
be
unknown
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
but
dear
Miss
Woodhouse
,
she
is
now
in
such
retirement
,
such
obscurity
,
so
thrown
away
.
 
<EOS>
Whatever
advantages
she
may
have
enjoyed
with
the
Campbells
are
so
palpably
at
an
end
!
<EOS>
And
I
think
she
feels
it
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
she
does
.
<EOS>
She
is
very
timid
and
silent
.
<EOS>
One
can
see
that
she
feels
the
want
of
encouragement
.
<EOS>
I
like
her
the
better
for
it
.
<EOS>
I
must
confess
it
is
a
recommendation
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
am
a
great
advocate
for
timidity
 
<EOS>
and
I
am
sure
one
does
not
often
meet
with
it
.
 
<EOS>
But
in
those
who
are
at
all
inferior
,
it
is
extremely
prepossessing
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
I
assure
you
,
Jane
Fairfax
is
a
very
delightful
character
,
and
interests
me
more
than
I
can
express
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
appear
to
feel
a
great
deal
 
<EOS>
but
I
am
not
aware
how
you
or
any
of
Miss
Fairfax
's
acquaintance
here
,
any
of
those
who
have
known
her
longer
than
yourself
,
can
shew
her
any
other
attention
than
"
    
"
My
dear
Miss
Woodhouse
,
a
vast
deal
may
be
done
by
those
who
dare
to
act
.
<EOS>
You
and
I
need
not
be
afraid
.
<EOS>
If
_
we
_
set
the
example
,
many
will
follow
it
as
far
as
they
can
;
though
all
have
not
our
situations
.
<EOS>
_
We
_
have
carriages
to
fetch
and
convey
her
home
,
and
<EOS>
_
we
_
live
in
a
style
which
could
not
make
the
addition
of
Jane
Fairfax
,
<EOS>
at
any
time
,
the
least
inconvenient
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
be
extremely
displeased
if
Wright
were
to
send
us
up
such
a
dinner
,
as
could
make
me
regret
having
asked
_
more
_
than
Jane
Fairfax
to
partake
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
idea
of
that
sort
of
thing
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
likely
that
I
_
<EOS>
should
_
,
considering
what
I
have
been
used
to
.
<EOS>
My
greatest
danger
,
perhaps
,
in
housekeeping
,
may
be
quite
the
other
way
,
in
doing
too
much
,
and
being
too
careless
of
expense
.
<EOS>
Maple
Grove
will
probably
be
my
model
more
than
it
ought
to
be
 
for
we
do
not
at
all
affect
to
equal
my
brother
,
Mr.
Suckling
,
in
income
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
my
resolution
is
taken
as
to
noticing
Jane
Fairfax
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
certainly
have
her
very
often
at
my
house
,
shall
introduce
her
wherever
I
can
,
shall
have
musical
parties
to
draw
out
her
talents
,
and
shall
be
constantly
on
the
watch
for
an
eligible
situation
.
<EOS>
My
acquaintance
is
so
very
extensive
,
that
I
have
little
doubt
of
hearing
of
something
to
suit
her
shortly
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
introduce
her
,
of
course
,
very
particularly
to
my
brother
and
sister
when
they
come
to
us
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
they
will
like
her
extremely
;
and
when
she
gets
a
little
acquainted
with
them
,
her
fears
will
completely
wear
off
,
for
there
really
is
nothing
in
the
manners
of
either
<EOS>
but
what
is
highly
conciliating
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
have
her
very
often
indeed
while
they
are
with
me
,
and
I
dare
say
we
shall
sometimes
find
a
seat
for
her
in
the
barouche
-
landau
in
some
of
our
exploring
parties
.

<EOS>
"
Poor
Jane
Fairfax
!
"
 
<EOS>
thought
Emma
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
not
deserved
this
.
<EOS>
You
may
have
done
wrong
with
regard
to
Mr.
Dixon
,
but
this
is
a
punishment
beyond
what
you
can
have
merited

<EOS>
The
kindness
and
protection
of
Mrs.
Elton
!

Jane
Fairfax
and
Jane
Fairfax

<EOS>
"
Heavens
!
<EOS>
Let
me
not
suppose
that
she
dares
go
about
,
Emma
Woodhouse
-
ing
me
!
 
<EOS>
But
upon
my
honour
,
there
seems
no
limits
to
the
licentiousness
of
that
woman
's
tongue
!
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
had
not
to
listen
to
such
paradings
again
 
to
any
so
exclusively
addressed
to
herself
 
so
disgustingly
decorated
with
a
"
dear
Miss
Woodhouse
.
<EOS>
"
The
change
on
Mrs.
Elton
's
side
soon
afterwards
appeared
,
and
she
was
left
in
peace
 
neither
forced
to
be
the
very
particular
friend
of
Mrs.
Elton
,
nor
,
under
Mrs.
Elton
's
guidance
,
the
very
active
patroness
of
Jane
Fairfax
,
and
only
sharing
with
others
in
a
general
way
,
in
knowing
what
was
felt
,
what
was
meditated
,
what
was
done
.
  
<EOS>
She
looked
on
with
some
amusement
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Bates
's
gratitude
for
Mrs.
Elton
's
attentions
to
Jane
was
in
the
first
style
of
guileless
simplicity
and
warmth
.
<EOS>
She
was
quite
one
of
her
worthies
 
the
most
amiable
,
affable
,
delightful
woman
 
just
as
accomplished
and
condescending
as
Mrs.
Elton
meant
to
be
considered
.
<EOS>
Emma
's
only
surprize
was
that
Jane
Fairfax
should
accept
those
attentions
and
tolerate
Mrs.
Elton
as
she
seemed
to
do
.
<EOS>
She
heard
of
her
walking
with
the
Eltons
,
sitting
with
the
Eltons
,
spending
a
day
with
the
Eltons
!
<EOS>
This
was
astonishing
!
 
<EOS>
She
could
not
have
believed
it
possible
that
the
taste
or
the
pride
of
Miss
Fairfax
could
endure
such
society
and
friendship
as
the
Vicarage
had
to
offer
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
is
a
riddle
,
quite
a
riddle
!
"
said
she
.
 
<EOS>
"
To
chuse
to
remain
here
month
after
month
,
under
privations
of
every
sort
!
<EOS>
And
now
to
chuse
the
mortification
of
Mrs.
Elton
's
notice
and
the
penury
of
her
conversation
,
rather
than
return
to
the
superior
companions
who
have
always
loved
her
with
such
real
,
generous
affection
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Jane
had
come
to
Highbury
professedly
for
three
months
;
the
Campbells
were
gone
to
Ireland
for
three
months
;
but
now
the
Campbells
had
promised
their
daughter
to
stay
at
least
till
Midsummer
,
and
fresh
invitations
had
arrived
for
her
to
join
them
there
.
<EOS>
According
to
Miss
Bates
 
<EOS>
it
all
came
from
her
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Dixon
had
written
most
pressingly
.
<EOS>
Would
Jane
but
go
,
means
were
to
be
found
,
servants
sent
,
friends
contrived
 
no
travelling
difficulty
allowed
to
exist
;
but
still
she
had
declined
it
!
  
<EOS>
"
She
must
have
some
motive
,
more
powerful
than
appears
,
for
refusing
this
invitation
,
"
was
Emma
's
conclusion
.
<EOS>
"
She
must
be
under
some
sort
of
penance
,
inflicted
either
by
the
Campbells
or
herself
.
<EOS>
There
is
great
fear
,
great
caution
,
great
resolution
somewhere
.
 
<EOS>
She
is
_
not
<EOS>
_
to
be
with
the
_
Dixons
_
.
<EOS>
The
decree
is
issued
by
somebody
.
<EOS>
But
why
must
she
consent
to
be
with
the
Eltons
?
 
<EOS>
Here
is
quite
a
separate
puzzle
.
"
  
<EOS>
Upon
her
speaking
her
wonder
aloud
on
that
part
of
the
subject
,
before
the
few
who
knew
her
opinion
of
Mrs.
Elton
,
Mrs.
Weston
ventured
this
apology
for
Jane
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
can
not
suppose
that
she
has
any
great
enjoyment
at
the
Vicarage
,
my
dear
Emma
 
<EOS>
but
it
is
better
than
being
always
at
home
.
<EOS>
Her
aunt
is
a
good
creature
,
but
,
as
a
constant
companion
,
must
be
very
tiresome
.
<EOS>
We
must
consider
what
Miss
Fairfax
quits
,
before
we
condemn
her
taste
for
what
she
goes
to
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
right
,
Mrs.
Weston
,
"
said
Mr.
Knightley
warmly
,
"
Miss
Fairfax
is
as
capable
as
any
of
us
of
forming
a
just
opinion
of
Mrs.
Elton
.
<EOS>
Could
she
have
chosen
with
whom
to
associate
,
she
would
not
have
chosen
her
.
<EOS>
But
(
with
a
reproachful
smile
at
Emma
)
she
receives
attentions
from
Mrs.
Elton
,
which
nobody
else
pays
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
felt
that
Mrs.
Weston
was
giving
her
a
momentary
glance
;
and
she
was
herself
struck
by
his
warmth
.
<EOS>
With
a
faint
blush
,
she
presently
replied
,
  
"
Such
attentions
as
Mrs.
Elton
's
,
I
should
have
imagined
,
would
rather
disgust
than
gratify
Miss
Fairfax
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Elton
's
invitations
<EOS>
I
should
have
imagined
any
thing
but
inviting
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
not
wonder
,
"
said
Mrs.
Weston
,
"
if
Miss
Fairfax
were
to
have
been
drawn
on
beyond
her
own
inclination
,
by
her
aunt
's
eagerness
in
accepting
Mrs.
Elton
's
civilities
for
her
.
<EOS>
Poor
Miss
Bates
may
very
likely
have
committed
her
niece
and
hurried
her
into
a
greater
appearance
of
intimacy
than
her
own
good
sense
would
have
dictated
,
in
spite
of
the
very
natural
wish
of
a
little
change
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Both
felt
rather
anxious
to
hear
him
speak
again
;
and
after
a
few
minutes
silence
,
he
said
,
  
"
Another
thing
must
be
taken
into
consideration
too
 
Mrs.
Elton
does
not
talk
_
to
_
Miss
Fairfax
as
she
speaks
_
of
_
her
.
<EOS>
We
all
know
the
difference
between
the
pronouns
he
or
she
and
thou
,
the
plainest
spoken
amongst
us
;
we
all
feel
the
influence
of
a
something
beyond
common
civility
in
our
personal
intercourse
with
each
other
 
a
something
more
early
implanted
.
<EOS>
We
can
not
give
any
body
the
disagreeable
hints
that
we
may
have
been
very
full
of
the
hour
before
.
<EOS>
We
feel
things
differently
.
<EOS>
And
besides
the
operation
of
this
,
as
a
general
principle
,
you
may
be
sure
that
Miss
Fairfax
awes
Mrs.
Elton
by
her
superiority
both
of
mind
and
manner
;
and
that
,
face
to
face
,
Mrs.
Elton
treats
her
with
all
the
respect
which
she
has
a
claim
to
.
<EOS>
Such
a
woman
as
Jane
Fairfax
probably
never
fell
in
Mrs.
Elton
's
way
before
 
and
no
degree
of
vanity
can
prevent
her
acknowledging
her
own
comparative
littleness
in
action
,
if
not
in
consciousness
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
how
highly
you
think
of
Jane
Fairfax
,
"
said
Emma
.
<EOS>
Little
Henry
was
in
her
thoughts
,
and
a
mixture
of
alarm
and
delicacy
made
her
irresolute
what
else
to
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
he
replied
,
"
any
body
may
know
how
highly
I
think
of
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
yet
,
"
said
Emma
,
beginning
hastily
and
with
an
arch
look
,
but
soon
stopping
 
it
was
better
,
however
,
to
know
the
worst
at
once
 
she
hurried
on
 
"
<EOS>
And
yet
,
perhaps
,
you
may
hardly
be
aware
yourself
how
highly
it
is
.
<EOS>
The
extent
of
your
admiration
may
take
you
by
surprize
some
day
or
other
.

<EOS>
Mr.
Knightley
was
hard
at
work
upon
the
lower
buttons
of
his
thick
leather
gaiters
,
and
either
the
exertion
of
getting
them
together
,
or
some
other
cause
,
brought
the
colour
into
his
face
,
as
he
answered
,
  
"

Oh

are
you
there

you
are

Cole
gave
me
a
hint
of
it
six
weeks
ago

<EOS>
He
stopped
.
 
<EOS>
Emma
felt
her
foot
pressed
by
Mrs.
Weston
,
and
did
not
herself
know
what
to
think
.
<EOS>
In
a
moment
he
went
on
    
"
That
will
never
be

I
can
assure
you

I
am
very
sure
I
shall
never
ask
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
returned
her
friend
's
pressure
with
interest
;
and
was
pleased
enough
to
exclaim
,
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
not
vain
,
Mr.
Knightley
.
<EOS>
I
will
say
that
for
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
seemed
hardly
to
hear
her
;
he
was
thoughtful
 
and
in
a
manner
which
shewed
him
not
pleased
,
soon
afterwards
said
,
  
"
<EOS>
So
you
have
been
settling
that
I
should
marry
Jane
Fairfax
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
indeed
I
have
not
.
<EOS>
You
have
scolded
me
too
much
for
match
-
making
,
for
me
to
presume
to
take
such
a
liberty
with
you
.
<EOS>
What
I
said
just
now
,
meant
nothing
.
<EOS>
One
says
those
sort
of
things
,
of
course
,
without
any
idea
of
a
serious
meaning
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
no
,
upon
my
word
I
have
not
the
smallest
wish
for
your
marrying
Jane
Fairfax
or
Jane
any
body
.
<EOS>
You
would
not
come
in
and
sit
with
us
in
this
comfortable
way
,
if
you
were
married
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Knightley
was
thoughtful
again
.
<EOS>
The
result
of
his
reverie
was
,
"
No
,
Emma
,
I
do
not
think
the
extent
of
my
admiration
for
her
will
ever
take
me
by
surprize
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
had
a
thought
of
her
in
that
way
,
I
assure
you
.
"
<EOS>
And
soon
afterwards
,
"
Jane
Fairfax
is
a
very
charming
young
woman
 
but
not
even
Jane
Fairfax
is
perfect
.
<EOS>
She
has
a
fault
.
<EOS>
She
has
not
the
open
temper
which
a
man
would
wish
for
in
a
wife
.
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
could
not
but
rejoice
to
hear
that
she
had
a
fault
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
"
said
she
,
"
and
<EOS>
you
soon
silenced
Mr.
Cole
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
very
soon
.
<EOS>
He
gave
me
a
quiet
hint
;
I
told
him
he
was
mistaken
;
he
asked
my
pardon
and
said
no
more
.
<EOS>
Cole
does
not
want
to
be
wiser
or
wittier
than
his
neighbours
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
In
that
respect
how
unlike
dear
Mrs.
Elton
,
who
wants
to
be
wiser
and
wittier
than
all
the
world
!
<EOS>
I
wonder
how
she
speaks
of
the
Coles
 
<EOS>
what
she
calls
them
!
<EOS>
How
can
she
find
any
appellation
for
them
,
deep
enough
in
familiar
vulgarity
?
<EOS>
She
calls
you
,
Knightley
 
what
can
she
do
for
Mr.
Cole
?
<EOS>
And
so
I
am
not
to
be
surprized
that
Jane
Fairfax
accepts
her
civilities
and
consents
to
be
with
her
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Weston
,
your
argument
weighs
most
with
me
.
<EOS>
I
can
much
more
readily
enter
into
the
temptation
of
getting
away
from
Miss
Bates
,
than
I
can
believe
in
the
triumph
of
Miss
Fairfax
's
mind
over
Mrs.
Elton
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
faith
in
Mrs.
Elton
's
acknowledging
herself
the
inferior
in
thought
,
word
,
or
deed
;
or
in
her
being
under
any
restraint
beyond
her
own
scanty
rule
of
good
-
breeding
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
imagine
that
she
will
not
be
continually
insulting
her
visitor
with
praise
,
encouragement
,
and
offers
of
service
;
that
she
will
not
be
continually
detailing
her
magnificent
intentions
,
from
the
procuring
her
<EOS>
a
permanent
situation
to
the
including
her
in
those
delightful
exploring
parties
which
are
to
take
place
in
the
barouche
-
landau
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Jane
Fairfax
has
feeling
,
"
said
Mr.
Knightley
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
accuse
her
of
want
of
feeling
.
<EOS>
Her
sensibilities
,
I
suspect
,
are
strong
 
and
her
temper
excellent
in
its
power
of
forbearance
,
patience
,
self
-
control
;
but
it
wants
openness
.
<EOS>
She
is
reserved
,
more
reserved
,
I
think
,
than
she
used
to
be
 
<EOS>
And
I
love
an
open
temper
.
<EOS>
No
 
till
Cole
alluded
to
my
supposed
attachment
,
it
had
never
entered
my
head
.
<EOS>
I
saw
Jane
Fairfax
and
conversed
with
her
,
with
admiration
and
pleasure
always
 
<EOS>
but
with
no
thought
beyond
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Mrs.
Weston
,
"
said
Emma
triumphantly
when
he
left
them
,
"
what
do
you
say
now
to
Mr.
Knightley
's
marrying
Jane
Fairfax
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
really
,
dear
Emma
,
I
say
that
he
is
so
very
much
occupied
by
the
idea
of
_
not
_
being
in
love
with
her
,
that
I
should
not
wonder
if
it
were
to
end
in
his
being
so
at
last
.
<EOS>
Do
not
beat
me
.
"
    
<EOS>
Every
body
in
and
about
Highbury
who
had
ever
visited
Mr.
Elton
,
was
disposed
to
pay
him
attention
on
his
marriage
.
<EOS>
Dinner
-
parties
and
evening
-
parties
were
made
for
him
and
his
lady
;
and
invitations
flowed
in
so
fast
that
she
had
soon
the
pleasure
of
apprehending
they
were
never
to
have
a
disengaged
day
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
see
how
it
is
,
"
said
she
.
<EOS>
"
I
see
what
a
life
I
am
to
lead
among
you
.
<EOS>
Upon
my
word
we
shall
be
absolutely
dissipated
.
<EOS>
We
really
seem
quite
the
fashion
.
<EOS>
If
this
is
living
in
the
country
,
it
is
nothing
very
formidable
.
<EOS>
From
Monday
next
to
Saturday
,
I
assure
you
we
have
not
a
disengaged
day
!
 
<EOS>
A
woman
with
fewer
resources
than
I
have
,
need
not
have
been
at
a
loss
.
"
  
<EOS>
No
invitation
came
amiss
to
her
.
<EOS>
Her
Bath
habits
made
evening
-
parties
perfectly
natural
to
her
,
and
Maple
Grove
had
given
her
a
taste
for
dinners
.
<EOS>
She
was
a
little
shocked
at
the
want
of
two
drawing
rooms
,
at
the
poor
attempt
at
rout
-
cakes
,
and
there
being
no
ice
in
the
Highbury
card
-
parties
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bates
,
Mrs.
Perry
,
Mrs.
Goddard
and
others
,
were
a
good
deal
behind
-
hand
in
knowledge
of
the
world
,
but
she
would
soon
shew
them
how
every
thing
ought
to
be
arranged
.
<EOS>
In
the
course
of
the
spring
she
must
return
their
civilities
by
one
very
superior
party
 
in
which
her
card
-
tables
should
be
set
out
with
their
separate
candles
and
unbroken
packs
in
the
true
style
 
and
more
waiters
engaged
for
the
evening
than
their
own
establishment
could
furnish
,
to
carry
round
the
refreshments
at
exactly
the
proper
hour
,
and
in
the
proper
order
.
  
<EOS>
Emma
,
in
the
meanwhile
,
could
not
be
satisfied
without
a
dinner
at
Hartfield
for
the
Eltons
.
<EOS>
They
must
not
do
less
than
others
,
or
she
should
be
exposed
to
odious
suspicions
,
and
imagined
capable
of
pitiful
resentment
.
<EOS>
A
dinner
there
must
be
.
<EOS>
After
Emma
had
talked
about
it
for
ten
minutes
,
Mr.
Woodhouse
felt
no
unwillingness
,
and
only
made
the
usual
stipulation
of
not
sitting
at
the
bottom
of
the
table
himself
,
with
the
usual
regular
difficulty
of
deciding
who
should
do
it
for
him
.
  
<EOS>
The
persons
to
be
invited
,
required
little
thought
.
<EOS>
Besides
the
Eltons
,
it
must
be
the
Westons
and
Mr.
Knightley
;
so
far
it
was
all
of
course
 
and
it
was
hardly
less
inevitable
that
poor
little
Harriet
must
be
asked
to
make
the
eighth
:
 
but
this
invitation
was
not
given
with
equal
satisfaction
,
and
on
many
accounts
Emma
was
particularly
pleased
by
<EOS>
Harriet
's
begging
to
be
allowed
to
decline
it
.
<EOS>
"
She
would
rather
not
be
in
his
company
more
than
she
could
help
.
<EOS>
She
was
not
yet
quite
able
to
see
him
and
his
charming
happy
wife
together
,
without
feeling
uncomfortable
.
<EOS>
If
Miss
Woodhouse
would
not
be
displeased
,
she
would
rather
stay
at
home
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
precisely
what
Emma
would
have
wished
,
had
she
deemed
it
possible
enough
for
wishing
.
<EOS>
She
was
delighted
with
the
fortitude
of
her
little
friend
 
for
fortitude
<EOS>
she
knew
it
was
in
her
to
give
up
being
in
company
and
stay
at
home
;
and
she
could
now
invite
the
very
person
whom
she
really
wanted
to
make
the
eighth
,
Jane
Fairfax
.
  
<EOS>
Since
her
last
conversation
with
Mrs.
Weston
and
Mr.
Knightley
,
she
was
more
conscience
-
stricken
about
Jane
Fairfax
than
she
had
often
been
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Knightley
's
words
dwelt
with
her
.
<EOS>
He
had
said
that
Jane
Fairfax
received
attentions
from
Mrs.
Elton
which
nobody
else
paid
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
This
is
very
true
,
"
said
she
,
"
at
least
as
far
as
relates
to
me
,
which
was
all
that
was
meant
 
<EOS>
and
it
is
very
shameful
.
 
<EOS>
Of
the
same
age
 
and
always
knowing
her
 
<EOS>
I
ought
to
have
been
more
her
friend
.
 
<EOS>
She
will
never
like
me
now
.
<EOS>
I
have
neglected
her
too
long
.
<EOS>
But
I
will
shew
her
greater
attention
than
I
have
done
.
"
  
<EOS>
Every
invitation
was
successful
.
<EOS>
They
were
all
disengaged
and
all
happy
.
 
<EOS>
The
preparatory
interest
of
this
dinner
,
however
,
was
not
yet
over
.
<EOS>
A
circumstance
rather
unlucky
occurred
.
<EOS>
The
two
eldest
little
Knightleys
were
engaged
to
pay
their
grandpapa
and
aunt
a
visit
of
some
weeks
in
the
spring
,
and
their
papa
now
proposed
bringing
them
,
and
staying
one
whole
day
at
Hartfield
 
which
one
day
would
be
the
very
day
of
this
party
.
 
<EOS>
His
professional
engagements
did
not
allow
of
his
being
put
off
,
but
both
father
and
daughter
were
disturbed
by
its
happening
so
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Woodhouse
considered
eight
persons
at
dinner
together
as
the
utmost
that
his
nerves
could
bear
 
and
here
would
be
a
ninth
 
and
Emma
apprehended
that
it
would
be
a
ninth
very
much
out
of
humour
at
not
being
able
to
come
even
to
Hartfield
for
forty
-
eight
hours
without
falling
in
with
a
dinner
-
party
.
  
<EOS>
She
comforted
her
father
better
than
she
could
comfort
herself
,
by
representing
that
though
he
certainly
would
make
them
nine
,
yet
he
always
said
so
little
,
that
the
increase
of
noise
would
be
very
immaterial
.
<EOS>
She
thought
it
in
reality
a
sad
exchange
for
herself
,
to
have
him
with
his
grave
looks
and
reluctant
conversation
opposed
to
her
instead
of
his
brother
.
  
<EOS>
The
event
was
more
favourable
to
Mr.
Woodhouse
than
to
Emma
.
<EOS>
John
Knightley
came
;
but
Mr.
Weston
was
unexpectedly
summoned
to
town
and
must
be
absent
on
the
very
day
.
<EOS>
He
might
be
able
to
join
them
in
the
evening
,
but
certainly
not
to
dinner
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Woodhouse
was
quite
at
ease
;
and
the
seeing
him
so
,
with
the
arrival
of
the
little
boys
and
the
philosophic
composure
of
her
brother
on
hearing
his
fate
,
removed
the
chief
of
even
Emma
's
vexation
.
  
<EOS>
The
day
came
,
the
party
were
punctually
assembled
,
and
Mr.
John
Knightley
seemed
early
to
devote
himself
to
the
business
of
being
agreeable
.
<EOS>
Instead
of
drawing
his
brother
off
to
a
window
while
they
waited
for
dinner
,
he
was
talking
to
Miss
Fairfax
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Elton
,
as
elegant
as
lace
and
pearls
could
make
her
,
he
looked
at
in
silence
 
wanting
only
to
observe
enough
for
Isabella
's
information
 
but
<EOS>
Miss
Fairfax
was
an
old
acquaintance
and
a
quiet
girl
,
and
he
could
talk
to
her
.
<EOS>
He
had
met
her
before
breakfast
as
he
was
returning
from
a
walk
with
his
little
boys
,
when
it
had
been
just
beginning
to
rain
.
<EOS>
It
was
natural
to
have
some
civil
hopes
on
the
subject
,
and
he
said
,
  
"
I
hope
you
did
not
venture
far
,
Miss
Fairfax
,
this
morning
,
or
I
am
sure
you
must
have
been
wet
.
 
<EOS>
We
scarcely
got
home
in
time
.
<EOS>
I
hope
you
turned
directly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
went
only
to
the
post
-
office
,
"
said
she
,
"
and
reached
home
before
the
rain
was
much
.
<EOS>
It
is
my
daily
errand
.
<EOS>
I
always
fetch
the
letters
when
I
am
here
.
<EOS>
It
saves
trouble
,
and
is
a
something
to
get
me
out
.
<EOS>
A
walk
before
breakfast
does
me
good
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
a
walk
in
the
rain
,
I
should
imagine
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
<EOS>
but
it
did
not
absolutely
rain
when
I
set
out
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
John
Knightley
smiled
,
and
replied
,
  
"
<EOS>
That
is
to
say
,
you
chose
to
have
your
walk
,
for
you
<EOS>
were
not
six
yards
from
your
own
door
when
I
had
the
pleasure
of
meeting
you
;
and
Henry
and
John
had
seen
more
drops
than
they
could
count
long
before
.
<EOS>
The
post
-
office
has
a
great
charm
at
one
period
of
our
lives
.
<EOS>
When
you
have
lived
to
my
age
,
you
will
begin
to
think
letters
are
never
worth
going
through
the
rain
for
.
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
little
blush
,
and
then
this
answer
,
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
not
hope
to
be
ever
situated
as
you
are
,
in
the
midst
of
every
dearest
connexion
,
and
therefore
I
can
not
expect
that
simply
growing
older
should
make
me
indifferent
about
letters
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Indifferent
!
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
no
 
<EOS>
I
never
conceived
you
could
become
indifferent
.
<EOS>
Letters
are
no
matter
of
indifference
;
they
are
generally
a
very
positive
curse
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
speaking
of
letters
of
business
;
mine
are
letters
of
friendship
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
often
thought
them
the
worst
of
the
two
,
"
replied
he
coolly
.
<EOS>
"
Business
,
you
know
,
may
bring
money
,
but
friendship
hardly
ever
does
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
you
are
not
serious
now
.
<EOS>
I
know
Mr.
John
Knightley
<EOS>
too
well
 
<EOS>
I
am
very
sure
he
understands
the
value
of
friendship
as
well
as
any
body
.
<EOS>
I
can
easily
believe
that
letters
are
very
little
to
you
,
much
less
than
to
me
,
but
it
is
not
your
being
ten
years
older
than
myself
which
makes
the
difference
,
it
is
not
age
,
but
situation
.
<EOS>
You
have
every
body
dearest
to
you
always
at
hand
,
I
,
probably
,
never
shall
again
;
and
therefore
till
I
have
outlived
all
my
affections
,
a
post
-
office
,
I
think
,
must
always
have
power
to
draw
me
out
,
in
worse
weather
than
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
When
I
talked
of
your
being
altered
by
time
,
by
the
progress
of
years
,
"
said
John
Knightley
,
"
I
meant
to
imply
the
change
of
situation
which
time
usually
brings
.
<EOS>
I
consider
one
as
including
the
other
.
<EOS>
Time
will
generally
lessen
the
interest
of
every
attachment
not
within
the
daily
circle
 
<EOS>
but
that
is
not
the
change
I
had
in
view
for
you
.
<EOS>
As
an
old
friend
,
you
will
allow
me
to
hope
,
Miss
Fairfax
,
that
ten
years
hence
you
may
have
as
many
concentrated
objects
as
I
have
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
kindly
said
,
and
very
far
from
giving
offence
.
<EOS>
A
pleasant
"
thank
you
"
seemed
meant
to
laugh
it
off
,
but
a
blush
,
a
quivering
lip
,
a
tear
in
the
eye
,
shewed
that
it
was
felt
beyond
a
laugh
.
<EOS>
Her
attention
was
now
claimed
by
Mr.
Woodhouse
,
who
being
,
according
to
his
custom
on
such
occasions
,
making
the
circle
of
his
guests
,
and
paying
his
particular
compliments
to
the
ladies
,
was
ending
with
her
 
and
with
all
his
mildest
urbanity
,
said
,
  
"
I
am
very
sorry
to
hear
,
Miss
Fairfax
,
of
your
being
out
this
morning
in
the
rain
.
<EOS>
Young
ladies
should
take
care
of
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
Young
ladies
are
delicate
plants
.
<EOS>
They
should
take
care
of
their
health
and
their
complexion
.
<EOS>
My
dear
,
did
you
change
your
stockings
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
,
I
did
indeed
;
and
I
am
very
much
obliged
by
your
kind
solicitude
about
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Miss
Fairfax
,
young
ladies
are
very
sure
to
be
cared
for
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
your
good
grand
-
mama
and
aunt
are
well
.
<EOS>
They
are
some
of
my
very
old
friends
.
<EOS>
I
wish
my
health
allowed
me
to
be
a
better
neighbour
.
<EOS>
You
do
us
a
great
deal
of
honour
to
-
day
,
I
am
sure
.
<EOS>
My
daughter
and
I
are
both
highly
sensible
of
your
goodness
,
and
have
the
greatest
satisfaction
in
seeing
you
at
Hartfield
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
kind
-
hearted
,
polite
old
man
might
then
sit
down
and
feel
that
he
had
done
his
duty
,
and
made
every
fair
lady
welcome
and
easy
.
  
<EOS>
By
this
time
,
the
walk
in
the
rain
had
reached
Mrs.
Elton
,
and
her
remonstrances
now
opened
upon
Jane
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Jane
,
what
is
this
I
hear
?
 
<EOS>
Going
to
the
post
-
office
in
the
rain
!
 
<EOS>
This
must
not
be
,
I
assure
you
.
 
<EOS>
You
sad
girl
,
how
could
you
do
such
a
thing
?
 
<EOS>
It
is
a
sign
<EOS>
I
was
not
there
to
take
care
of
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Jane
very
patiently
assured
her
that
she
had
not
caught
any
cold
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
do
not
tell
_
me
_
.
<EOS>
You
really
are
a
very
sad
girl
,
and
do
not
know
how
to
take
care
of
yourself
.
 
<EOS>
To
the
post
-
office
indeed
!
<EOS>
Mrs.
Weston
,
did
you
ever
hear
the
like
?
<EOS>
You
and
I
must
positively
exert
our
authority
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
advice
,
"
said
Mrs.
Weston
kindly
and
persuasively
,
"
I
certainly
do
feel
tempted
to
give
.
<EOS>
Miss
Fairfax
,
you
must
not
run
such
risks
.
 
<EOS>
Liable
as
you
have
been
to
severe
colds
,
indeed
you
ought
to
be
particularly
careful
,
especially
at
this
time
of
year
.
<EOS>
The
spring
I
always
think
requires
more
than
common
care
.
<EOS>
Better
wait
an
hour
or
two
,
or
even
half
a
day
for
your
letters
,
than
run
the
risk
of
bringing
on
your
cough
again
.
<EOS>
Now
do
not
you
feel
that
you
had
?
<EOS>
Yes
,
I
am
sure
you
are
much
too
reasonable
.
<EOS>
You
look
as
if
you
would
not
do
such
a
thing
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Oh
!
<EOS>
she
_
<EOS>
shall
_
<EOS>
_
not
<EOS>
_
do
such
a
thing
again
,
"
eagerly
rejoined
Mrs.
Elton
.
<EOS>
"
We
will
not
allow
her
to
do
such
a
thing
again
:
"
 
and
nodding
significantly
 
<EOS>
"
there
must
be
some
arrangement
made
,
there
must
indeed
.
<EOS>
I
shall
speak
to
Mr.
E.
<EOS>
The
man
who
fetches
our
letters
every
morning
(
one
of
our
men
,
I
forget
his
name
)
<EOS>
shall
inquire
for
yours
too
and
bring
them
to
you
.
<EOS>
That
will
obviate
all
difficulties
you
know
;
and
from
_
us
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
I
really
think
,
my
dear
Jane
,
you
can
have
no
scruple
to
accept
such
an
accommodation
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
extremely
kind
,
"
said
Jane
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
can
not
give
up
my
early
walk
.
<EOS>
I
am
advised
to
be
out
of
doors
as
much
as
I
can
,
I
must
walk
somewhere
,
and
the
post
-
office
is
an
object
;
and
upon
my
word
,
I
have
scarcely
ever
had
a
bad
morning
before
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Jane
,
say
no
more
about
it
.
<EOS>
The
thing
is
determined
,
that
is
(
laughing
affectedly
)
as
far
as
I
can
presume
to
determine
any
thing
without
the
concurrence
of
my
lord
and
master
.
<EOS>
You
know
,
Mrs.
Weston
,
you
and
I
must
be
cautious
how
we
express
ourselves
.
<EOS>
But
I
do
flatter
myself
,
my
dear
Jane
,
that
my
influence
is
not
entirely
worn
out
.
<EOS>
If
I
meet
with
no
insuperable
difficulties
therefore
,
consider
that
point
as
settled
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Excuse
me
,
"
said
Jane
earnestly
,
"
I
can
not
by
any
means
consent
to
such
an
arrangement
,
so
needlessly
troublesome
to
your
servant
.
<EOS>
If
the
errand
were
not
a
pleasure
to
me
,
it
could
be
done
,
as
it
always
is
when
I
am
not
here
,
by
my
grandmama
's
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
my
dear
;
but
so
much
as
Patty
has
to
do
!
 
<EOS>
And
it
is
a
kindness
to
employ
our
men
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Jane
looked
as
if
she
did
not
mean
to
be
conquered
;
but
instead
of
answering
,
she
began
speaking
again
to
Mr.
John
Knightley
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
post
-
office
is
a
wonderful
establishment
!
"
said
she
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
regularity
and
despatch
of
it
!
<EOS>
If
one
thinks
of
all
that
it
has
to
do
,
and
all
that
it
does
so
well
,
it
is
really
astonishing
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
certainly
very
well
regulated
.
"
  
"
So
seldom
that
any
negligence
or
blunder
appears
!
<EOS>
So
seldom
that
a
letter
,
among
the
thousands
that
are
constantly
passing
about
the
kingdom
,
is
even
carried
wrong
 
and
not
one
in
a
million
,
I
suppose
,
actually
lost
!
<EOS>
And
when
one
considers
the
variety
of
hands
,
and
of
bad
hands
too
,
that
are
to
be
deciphered
,
it
increases
the
wonder
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
clerks
grow
expert
from
habit
.
 
<EOS>
They
must
begin
with
some
quickness
of
sight
and
hand
,
and
exercise
improves
them
.
<EOS>
If
you
want
any
farther
explanation
,
"
continued
he
,
smiling
,
"
they
are
paid
for
it
.
<EOS>
That
is
the
key
to
a
great
deal
of
capacity
.
<EOS>
The
public
pays
and
must
be
served
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
varieties
of
handwriting
were
farther
talked
of
,
and
the
usual
observations
made
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
heard
it
asserted
,
"
said
John
Knightley
,
"
that
the
same
sort
of
handwriting
often
prevails
in
a
family
;
and
where
the
same
master
teaches
,
it
is
natural
enough
.
<EOS>
But
for
that
reason
,
I
should
imagine
the
likeness
must
be
chiefly
confined
to
the
females
,
for
boys
have
very
little
teaching
after
an
early
age
,
and
scramble
into
any
hand
they
can
get
.
<EOS>
Isabella
and
Emma
,
I
think
,
do
write
very
much
alike
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
always
known
their
writing
apart
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
his
brother
hesitatingly
,
"
there
is
a
likeness
.
<EOS>
I
know
what
you
mean
 
<EOS>
but
Emma
's
hand
is
the
strongest
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Isabella
and
Emma
both
write
beautifully
,
"
said
Mr.
Woodhouse
;
"
and
always
did
.
<EOS>
And
so
does
poor
Mrs.
Weston
"
 
with
half
a
sigh
and
half
a
smile
at
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
saw
any
gentleman
's
handwriting
"
 
<EOS>
Emma
began
,
looking
also
at
Mrs.
Weston
;
but
stopped
,
on
perceiving
that
Mrs.
Weston
was
attending
to
some
one
else
 
and
the
pause
gave
her
time
to
reflect
,
"
<EOS>
Now
,
how
am
I
going
to
introduce
him
?
 
<EOS>
Am
I
unequal
to
speaking
his
name
at
once
before
all
these
people
?
<EOS>
Is
it
necessary
for
me
to
use
any
roundabout
phrase
?
 
<EOS>
Your
Yorkshire
friend
 
your
correspondent
in
Yorkshire
;
 
<EOS>
that
would
be
the
way
,
I
suppose
,
if
I
were
very
bad
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
I
can
pronounce
his
name
without
the
smallest
distress
.
<EOS>
I
certainly
get
better
and
better
.
 
<EOS>
Now
for
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Weston
was
disengaged
and
Emma
began
again
 
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
writes
one
of
the
best
gentleman
's
hands
I
ever
saw
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
admire
it
,
"
said
Mr.
Knightley
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
too
small
 
wants
strength
.
<EOS>
It
is
like
a
woman
's
writing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
was
not
submitted
to
by
either
lady
.
<EOS>
They
vindicated
him
against
the
base
aspersion
.
"
<EOS>
No
,
it
by
no
means
wanted
strength
 
<EOS>
it
was
not
a
large
hand
,
but
very
clear
and
certainly
strong
.
<EOS>
Had
not
Mrs.
Weston
<EOS>
any
letter
about
her
to
produce
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
she
had
heard
from
him
very
lately
,
but
having
answered
the
letter
,
had
put
it
away
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
we
were
in
the
other
room
,
"
said
Emma
,
"
if
I
had
my
writing
-
desk
,
I
am
sure
I
could
produce
a
specimen
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
note
of
his
.
 
<EOS>
Do
not
you
remember
,
Mrs.
Weston
,
employing
him
to
write
for
you
one
day
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
chose
to
say
he
was
employed
"
    
<EOS>
"
Well
,
well
,
I
have
that
note
;
and
can
shew
it
after
dinner
to
convince
Mr.
Knightley
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
when
a
gallant
young
man
,
like
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
,
"
said
Mr.
Knightley
dryly
,
"
writes
to
a
fair
lady
like
Miss
Woodhouse
,
he
will
,
of
course
,
put
forth
his
best
.
"
  
<EOS>
Dinner
was
on
table
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Elton
,
before
she
could
be
spoken
to
,
was
ready
;
and
before
Mr.
Woodhouse
had
reached
her
with
his
request
to
be
allowed
to
hand
her
into
the
dining
-
parlour
,
was
saying
    
"
Must
I
go
first
?
<EOS>
I
really
am
ashamed
of
always
leading
the
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Jane
's
solicitude
about
fetching
her
own
letters
had
not
escaped
Emma
.
<EOS>
She
had
heard
and
seen
it
all
;
and
felt
some
curiosity
to
know
whether
the
wet
walk
of
this
morning
had
produced
any
.
<EOS>
She
suspected
that
it
_
had
_
;
that
it
would
not
have
been
so
resolutely
encountered
but
in
full
expectation
of
hearing
from
some
one
very
dear
,
and
that
it
had
not
been
in
vain
.
<EOS>
She
thought
there
was
an
air
of
greater
happiness
than
usual
 
<EOS>
a
glow
both
of
complexion
and
spirits
.
  
<EOS>
She
could
have
made
an
inquiry
or
two
,
as
to
the
expedition
and
the
expense
of
the
Irish
mails
;
 
it
was
at
her
tongue
's
end
 
<EOS>
but
she
abstained
.
<EOS>
She
was
quite
determined
not
to
utter
a
word
that
should
hurt
Jane
Fairfax
's
feelings
;
and
they
followed
the
other
ladies
out
of
the
room
,
arm
in
arm
,
with
an
appearance
of
good
-
will
highly
becoming
to
the
beauty
and
grace
of
each
.
    
<EOS>
When
the
ladies
returned
to
the
drawing
-
room
after
dinner
,
Emma
found
it
hardly
possible
to
prevent
their
making
two
distinct
parties
;
 
with
so
much
perseverance
in
judging
and
behaving
ill
<EOS>
did
Mrs.
Elton
engross
Jane
Fairfax
and
slight
herself
.
<EOS>
She
and
Mrs.
Weston
were
obliged
to
be
almost
always
either
talking
together
or
silent
together
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Elton
left
them
no
choice
.
<EOS>
If
Jane
repressed
her
for
a
little
time
,
she
soon
began
again
;
and
though
much
that
passed
between
them
was
in
a
half
-
whisper
,
especially
on
Mrs.
Elton
's
side
,
there
was
no
avoiding
a
knowledge
of
their
principal
subjects
:
<EOS>
The
post
-
office
 
catching
<EOS>
cold
 
fetching
letters
 
and
friendship
,
were
long
under
discussion
;
and
to
them
succeeded
one
,
which
must
be
at
least
equally
unpleasant
to
Jane
 
inquiries
whether
she
had
yet
heard
of
any
situation
likely
to
suit
her
,
and
professions
of
Mrs.
Elton
's
meditated
activity
.
  
<EOS>
"
Here
is
April
come
!
"
<EOS>
said
she
,
"
I
get
quite
anxious
about
you
.
<EOS>
June
will
soon
be
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
have
never
fixed
on
June
or
any
other
month
 
merely
looked
forward
to
the
summer
in
general
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
have
you
really
heard
of
nothing
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
even
made
any
inquiry
;
I
do
not
wish
to
make
any
yet
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
my
dear
,
we
can
not
begin
too
early
;
you
are
not
aware
of
the
difficulty
of
procuring
exactly
the
desirable
thing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
not
aware
!
"
<EOS>
said
Jane
,
shaking
her
head
;
"
dear
Mrs.
Elton
,
who
can
have
thought
of
it
as
I
have
done
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
have
not
seen
so
much
of
the
world
as
I
have
.
<EOS>
You
do
not
know
how
many
candidates
there
always
are
for
the
_
first
_
situations
.
<EOS>
I
saw
a
vast
deal
of
that
in
the
neighbourhood
round
Maple
Grove
.
<EOS>
A
cousin
of
Mr.
Suckling
,
Mrs.
Bragge
,
had
such
an
infinity
of
applications
;
every
body
was
anxious
to
be
in
her
family
,
for
she
moves
in
the
first
circle
.
<EOS>
Wax
-
candles
in
the
schoolroom
!
<EOS>
You
may
imagine
how
desirable
!
<EOS>
Of
all
houses
in
the
kingdom
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bragge
's
is
the
one
I
would
most
wish
to
see
you
in
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Colonel
and
Mrs.
Campbell
are
to
be
in
town
again
by
midsummer
,
"
said
Jane
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
spend
some
time
with
them
;
I
am
sure
they
will
want
it
;
 
afterwards
I
may
probably
be
glad
to
dispose
of
myself
.
<EOS>
But
I
would
not
wish
you
to
take
the
trouble
of
making
any
inquiries
at
present
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Trouble
!
<EOS>
aye
,
I
know
your
scruples
.
<EOS>
You
are
afraid
of
giving
me
trouble
;
but
I
assure
you
,
my
dear
Jane
,
the
Campbells
can
hardly
be
more
interested
about
you
than
I
am
.
<EOS>
I
shall
write
to
Mrs.
Partridge
in
a
day
or
two
,
and
shall
give
her
a
strict
charge
to
be
on
the
look
-
out
for
any
thing
eligible
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
but
I
would
<EOS>
rather
you
did
not
mention
the
subject
to
her
;
till
the
time
draws
nearer
,
I
do
not
wish
to
be
giving
any
body
trouble
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
my
dear
child
,
the
time
is
drawing
near
;
here
is
April
,
and
June
,
or
say
even
July
,
is
very
near
,
with
such
business
to
accomplish
before
us
.
<EOS>
Your
inexperience
really
amuses
me
!
<EOS>
A
situation
such
as
you
deserve
,
and
your
friends
would
require
for
you
,
is
no
everyday
occurrence
,
is
not
obtained
at
a
moment
's
notice
;
indeed
,
indeed
,
we
must
begin
inquiring
directly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Excuse
me
,
ma'am
,
but
this
is
by
no
means
my
intention
;
I
make
no
inquiry
myself
,
and
should
be
sorry
to
have
any
made
by
my
friends
.
<EOS>
When
I
am
quite
determined
as
to
the
time
,
I
am
not
at
all
afraid
of
being
long
unemployed
.
<EOS>
There
are
places
in
town
,
offices
,
where
inquiry
would
soon
produce
something
 
<EOS>
Offices
for
the
sale
 
not
quite
of
human
flesh
 
but
of
human
intellect
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
my
dear
,
human
flesh
!
<EOS>
You
quite
shock
me
;
if
you
mean
a
fling
at
the
slave
-
trade
,
I
assure
you
<EOS>
Mr.
Suckling
was
always
rather
a
friend
to
the
abolition
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
not
mean
,
I
was
not
thinking
of
the
slave
-
trade
,
"
replied
Jane
;
"
governess
-
trade
,
I
assure
you
,
was
all
that
I
had
in
view
;
widely
different
certainly
as
to
the
guilt
of
those
who
carry
it
on
;
but
as
to
the
greater
misery
of
the
victims
,
I
do
not
know
where
it
lies
.
<EOS>
But
I
only
mean
to
say
that
there
are
advertising
offices
,
and
that
by
applying
to
them
I
should
have
no
doubt
of
very
soon
meeting
with
something
that
would
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Something
that
would
do
!
"
repeated
Mrs.
Elton
.
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
_
that
_
may
suit
your
humble
ideas
of
yourself
;
 
I
know
what
a
modest
creature
you
are
;
but
it
will
not
satisfy
your
friends
to
have
you
taking
up
with
any
thing
that
may
offer
,
any
inferior
,
commonplace
situation
,
in
a
family
not
moving
in
a
certain
circle
,
or
able
to
command
the
elegancies
of
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
very
obliging
;
but
as
to
all
that
,
I
am
very
indifferent
;
it
would
be
no
object
to
me
to
be
with
the
rich
;
my
mortifications
,
I
think
,
would
only
be
the
greater
;
I
should
suffer
more
from
comparison
.
<EOS>
A
gentleman
's
family
is
all
that
I
should
condition
for
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
you
,
I
know
you
;
you
would
take
up
with
any
thing
;
but
I
shall
be
a
little
more
nice
,
and
I
am
sure
the
good
Campbells
will
be
quite
on
my
side
;
with
your
superior
talents
,
you
have
a
right
to
move
in
the
first
circle
.
<EOS>
Your
musical
knowledge
alone
would
entitle
you
to
name
your
own
terms
,
have
as
many
rooms
as
you
like
,
and
mix
in
the
family
as
much
as
you
chose
;
 
that
is
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
 
<EOS>
if
you
knew
the
harp
,
you
might
do
all
that
,
I
am
very
sure
;
but
you
sing
as
well
as
play
;
 
yes
<EOS>
,
I
really
believe
you
might
,
even
without
the
harp
,
stipulate
for
what
you
chose
;
 
and
you
must
and
shall
be
delightfully
,
honourably
and
comfortably
settled
before
the
Campbells
<EOS>
or
I
have
any
rest
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
may
well
class
the
delight
,
the
honour
,
and
the
comfort
of
such
a
situation
together
,
"
said
Jane
,
"
they
are
pretty
sure
to
be
equal
;
however
,
I
am
very
serious
in
not
wishing
any
thing
to
be
attempted
at
present
for
me
.
<EOS>
I
am
exceedingly
obliged
to
you
,
Mrs.
Elton
,
I
am
obliged
to
any
body
who
feels
for
me
,
but
I
am
quite
serious
in
wishing
nothing
to
be
done
till
the
summer
.
<EOS>
For
two
or
three
months
longer
I
shall
remain
where
I
am
,
and
as
I
am
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
am
quite
serious
too
<EOS>
,
I
assure
you
,
"
replied
Mrs.
Elton
gaily
,
"
in
resolving
to
be
always
on
the
watch
,
and
employing
my
friends
to
watch
also
,
that
nothing
really
unexceptionable
may
pass
us
.
"
  
<EOS>
In
this
style
she
ran
on
;
never
thoroughly
stopped
by
any
thing
till
Mr.
Woodhouse
came
into
the
room
;
her
vanity
had
then
a
change
of
object
,
and
Emma
heard
her
saying
in
the
same
half
-
whisper
to
Jane
,
  
<EOS>
"
Here
comes
this
dear
old
beau
of
mine
,
I
protest
!
 
<EOS>
Only
think
of
his
gallantry
in
coming
away
before
the
other
men
!
 
<EOS>
what
a
dear
creature
he
is
;
 
I
assure
you
I
like
him
excessively
.
<EOS>
I
admire
all
that
quaint
,
old
-
fashioned
politeness
;
it
is
much
more
to
my
taste
than
modern
ease
;
modern
ease
often
disgusts
me
.
<EOS>
But
this
good
old
Mr.
Woodhouse
,
I
wish
you
had
heard
his
gallant
speeches
to
me
at
dinner
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
I
assure
you
I
began
to
think
my
caro
sposo
would
be
absolutely
jealous
.
<EOS>
I
fancy
<EOS>
I
am
rather
a
favourite
;
he
took
notice
of
my
gown
.
<EOS>
How
do
you
like
it
?
 
<EOS>
Selina
's
choice
 
handsome
,
I
think
,
<EOS>
but
I
do
not
know
whether
it
is
not
over
-
trimmed
;
I
have
the
greatest
dislike
to
the
idea
of
being
over
-
trimmed
 
quite
a
horror
of
finery
.
<EOS>
I
must
put
on
a
few
ornaments
now
,
because
it
is
expected
of
me
.
<EOS>
A
bride
,
you
know
,
must
appear
like
a
bride
,
but
my
natural
taste
is
all
for
simplicity
;
a
simple
style
of
dress
is
so
infinitely
preferable
to
finery
.
<EOS>
But
I
am
quite
in
the
minority
,
I
believe
;
few
people
seem
to
value
simplicity
of
dress
,
 
show
and
finery
are
every
thing
.
<EOS>
I
have
some
notion
of
putting
such
a
trimming
as
this
to
my
white
and
silver
poplin
.
<EOS>
Do
you
think
it
will
look
well
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
whole
party
were
but
just
reassembled
in
the
drawing
-
room
when
Mr.
Weston
made
his
appearance
among
them
.
<EOS>
He
had
returned
to
a
late
dinner
,
and
walked
to
Hartfield
as
soon
as
it
was
over
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
too
much
expected
by
the
best
judges
,
for
surprize
 
<EOS>
but
there
was
great
joy
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Woodhouse
was
almost
as
glad
to
see
him
now
,
as
he
would
have
been
sorry
to
see
him
before
.
<EOS>
John
Knightley
only
was
in
mute
astonishment
.
 
<EOS>
That
a
man
who
might
have
spent
his
evening
quietly
at
home
after
a
day
of
business
in
London
,
should
set
off
again
,
and
walk
half
a
mile
to
another
man
's
house
,
for
the
sake
of
being
in
mixed
company
till
bed
-
time
,
of
finishing
his
day
in
the
efforts
of
civility
and
the
noise
of
numbers
,
was
a
circumstance
to
strike
him
deeply
.
<EOS>
A
man
who
had
been
in
motion
since
eight
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
and
might
now
have
been
still
,
who
had
been
long
talking
,
and
might
have
been
silent
,
who
had
been
in
more
than
one
crowd
,
and
might
have
been
alone
!
 
<EOS>
Such
a
man
,
to
quit
the
tranquillity
and
independence
of
his
own
fireside
,
and
on
the
evening
of
a
cold
sleety
April
day
rush
out
again
into
the
world
!
 
<EOS>
Could
he
by
a
touch
of
his
finger
have
instantly
taken
back
his
wife
,
there
would
have
been
a
motive
;
but
his
coming
would
probably
prolong
rather
than
break
up
the
party
.
<EOS>
John
Knightley
looked
at
him
with
amazement
,
then
shrugged
his
shoulders
,
and
said
,
"
I
could
not
have
believed
it
even
of
_
him
_
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Weston
meanwhile
,
perfectly
unsuspicious
of
the
indignation
he
was
exciting
,
happy
and
cheerful
as
usual
,
and
with
all
the
right
of
being
principal
talker
,
which
a
day
spent
anywhere
from
home
confers
,
was
making
himself
agreeable
among
the
rest
;
and
having
satisfied
the
inquiries
of
his
wife
as
to
his
dinner
,
convincing
her
that
none
of
all
her
careful
directions
to
the
servants
had
been
forgotten
,
and
spread
abroad
what
public
news
he
had
heard
,
was
proceeding
to
a
family
communication
,
which
,
though
principally
addressed
to
Mrs.
Weston
,
he
had
not
the
smallest
doubt
of
being
highly
interesting
to
every
body
in
the
room
.
<EOS>
He
gave
her
a
letter
,
it
was
from
Frank
,
and
to
herself
;
he
had
met
with
it
in
his
way
,
and
had
taken
the
liberty
of
opening
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Read
it
,
read
it
,
"
said
he
,
"
it
will
give
you
pleasure
;
only
a
few
lines
 
will
not
take
you
long
;
read
it
to
Emma
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
two
ladies
looked
over
it
together
;
and
he
sat
smiling
and
talking
to
them
the
whole
time
,
in
a
voice
a
little
subdued
,
but
very
audible
to
every
body
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
he
is
coming
,
you
see
;
good
news
<EOS>
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
Well
,
what
do
you
say
to
it
?
 
<EOS>
I
always
told
you
he
would
be
here
again
soon
,
did
not
I
?
 
<EOS>
Anne
,
my
dear
,
did
not
I
always
tell
you
so
,
and
you
would
not
believe
me
?
 
<EOS>
In
town
next
week
,
you
see
 
at
the
latest
,
I
dare
say
;
for
_
she
_
is
as
impatient
as
the
black
gentleman
when
any
thing
is
to
be
done
;
most
likely
they
will
be
there
to
-
morrow
or
Saturday
.
<EOS>
As
to
her
illness
,
all
nothing
of
course
.
<EOS>
But
it
is
an
excellent
thing
to
have
Frank
among
us
again
,
so
near
as
town
.
<EOS>
They
will
stay
a
good
while
when
they
do
come
,
and
he
will
be
half
his
time
with
us
.
<EOS>
This
is
precisely
what
I
wanted
.
<EOS>
Well
,
pretty
good
news
,
is
not
it
?
<EOS>
Have
you
finished
it
?
<EOS>
Has
Emma
read
it
all
?
<EOS>
Put
it
up
,
put
it
up
;
we
will
have
a
good
talk
about
it
some
other
time
,
but
it
will
not
do
now
.
<EOS>
I
shall
only
just
mention
the
circumstance
to
the
others
in
a
common
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Weston
was
most
comfortably
pleased
on
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
Her
looks
and
words
had
nothing
to
restrain
them
.
<EOS>
She
was
happy
<EOS>
,
she
knew
she
was
happy
,
and
knew
she
ought
to
be
happy
.
<EOS>
Her
congratulations
were
warm
and
open
;
but
Emma
could
not
speak
so
fluently
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
She
_
was
a
little
occupied
in
weighing
her
own
feelings
,
and
trying
to
understand
the
degree
of
her
agitation
,
which
she
rather
thought
was
considerable
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Weston
,
however
,
too
eager
to
be
very
observant
,
too
communicative
to
want
others
to
talk
,
was
very
well
satisfied
with
what
she
did
say
,
and
soon
moved
away
to
make
the
rest
of
his
friends
happy
by
a
partial
communication
of
what
the
whole
room
must
have
overheard
already
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
well
that
he
took
every
body
's
joy
for
granted
,
or
he
might
not
have
thought
either
Mr.
Woodhouse
or
Mr.
Knightley
particularly
delighted
.
<EOS>
They
were
the
first
entitled
,
after
Mrs.
Weston
and
Emma
,
to
be
made
happy
;
 
from
them
he
would
have
proceeded
to
Miss
Fairfax
,
but
she
was
so
deep
in
conversation
with
John
Knightley
,
that
it
would
have
been
too
positive
an
interruption
;
and
finding
himself
close
to
Mrs.
Elton
,
and
her
attention
disengaged
,
he
necessarily
began
on
the
subject
with
her
.
    
<EOS>
"
I
hope
I
shall
soon
have
the
pleasure
of
introducing
my
son
to
you
,
"
said
Mr.
Weston
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Elton
,
very
willing
to
suppose
a
particular
compliment
intended
her
by
such
a
hope
,
smiled
most
graciously
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
heard
of
a
certain
Frank
Churchill
,
I
presume
,
"
he
continued
 
"
and
know
him
to
be
my
son
,
though
he
does
not
bear
my
name
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
yes
,
and
I
shall
be
very
happy
in
his
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
Mr.
Elton
will
lose
no
time
in
calling
on
him
;
and
we
shall
both
have
great
pleasure
in
seeing
him
at
the
Vicarage
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
very
obliging
.
 
<EOS>
Frank
will
be
extremely
happy
,
I
am
sure
.
  
<EOS>
He
is
to
be
in
town
next
week
,
if
not
sooner
.
<EOS>
We
have
notice
of
it
in
a
letter
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
I
met
the
letters
in
my
way
this
morning
,
and
seeing
my
son
's
hand
,
presumed
to
open
it
 
though
it
was
not
directed
to
me
 
<EOS>
it
was
to
Mrs.
Weston
.
<EOS>
She
is
his
principal
correspondent
,
I
assure
you
.
<EOS>
I
hardly
ever
get
a
letter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
so
you
absolutely
opened
what
was
directed
to
her
!
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
Mr.
Weston
 
<EOS>
(
laughing
affectedly
)
<EOS>
I
must
protest
against
that
.
 
<EOS>
A
most
dangerous
precedent
indeed
!
 
<EOS>
I
beg
<EOS>
you
will
not
let
your
neighbours
follow
your
example
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
my
word
,
if
this
is
what
I
am
to
expect
,
we
married
women
must
begin
to
exert
ourselves
!
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
Mr.
Weston
,
I
could
not
have
believed
it
of
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
we
men
are
sad
fellows
.
<EOS>
You
must
take
care
of
yourself
,
Mrs.
Elton
.
 
<EOS>
This
letter
tells
us
 
it
is
a
short
letter
 
written
in
a
hurry
,
merely
to
give
us
notice
 
<EOS>
it
tells
us
that
they
are
all
coming
up
to
town
directly
,
on
Mrs.
Churchill
's
account
 
<EOS>
she
has
not
been
well
the
whole
winter
,
and
thinks
Enscombe
too
cold
for
her
 
<EOS>
so
they
are
all
to
move
southward
without
loss
of
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Indeed
!
 
<EOS>
from
Yorkshire
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
Enscombe
is
in
Yorkshire
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
they
are
about
one
hundred
and
ninety
miles
from
London
,
a
considerable
journey
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
upon
my
word
,
very
considerable
.
<EOS>
Sixty
-
five
miles
farther
than
from
Maple
Grove
to
London
.
<EOS>
But
what
is
distance
,
Mr.
Weston
,
to
people
of
large
fortune
?
 
<EOS>
You
would
be
amazed
to
hear
how
my
brother
,
Mr.
Suckling
,
sometimes
flies
about
.
<EOS>
You
will
hardly
believe
me
 
but
twice
<EOS>
in
one
week
he
and
Mr.
Bragge
went
to
London
and
back
again
with
four
horses
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
evil
of
the
distance
from
Enscombe
,
"
said
Mr.
Weston
,
"
is
,
that
Mrs.
Churchill
,
_
as
_
_
<EOS>
we
<EOS>
_
_
understand
_
,
has
not
been
able
to
leave
the
sofa
for
a
week
together
.
<EOS>
In
Frank
's
last
letter
she
complained
,
he
said
,
of
being
too
weak
to
get
into
her
conservatory
without
having
both
his
arm
and
his
uncle
's
!
<EOS>
This
,
you
know
,
speaks
a
great
degree
of
weakness
 
<EOS>
but
now
she
is
so
impatient
to
be
in
town
,
that
she
means
to
sleep
only
two
nights
on
the
road
.
 
<EOS>
So
Frank
writes
word
.
<EOS>
Certainly
,
delicate
ladies
have
very
extraordinary
constitutions
,
Mrs.
Elton
.
<EOS>
You
must
grant
me
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
indeed
,
I
shall
grant
you
nothing
.
<EOS>
I
always
take
the
part
of
my
own
sex
.
<EOS>
I
do
indeed
.
<EOS>
I
give
you
notice
 
<EOS>
You
will
find
me
a
formidable
antagonist
on
that
point
.
<EOS>
I
always
stand
up
for
women
 
<EOS>
and
I
assure
you
,
if
you
knew
how
Selina
feels
with
respect
to
sleeping
at
an
inn
,
you
would
not
wonder
at
<EOS>
Mrs.
Churchill
's
making
incredible
exertions
to
avoid
it
.
<EOS>
Selina
says
it
is
quite
horror
to
her
 
<EOS>
and
I
believe
I
have
caught
a
little
of
her
nicety
.
<EOS>
She
always
travels
with
her
own
sheets
;
an
excellent
precaution
.
<EOS>
Does
Mrs.
Churchill
do
the
same
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Depend
upon
it
,
Mrs.
Churchill
does
every
thing
that
any
other
fine
lady
ever
did
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Churchill
will
not
be
second
to
any
lady
in
the
land
for
"
    
Mrs.
Elton
eagerly
interposed
with
,
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
Mr.
Weston
,
do
not
mistake
me
.
<EOS>
Selina
is
no
fine
lady
,
I
assure
you
.
<EOS>
Do
not
run
away
with
such
an
idea
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
not
she
?
<EOS>
Then
she
is
no
rule
for
Mrs.
Churchill
,
who
is
as
thorough
a
fine
lady
as
any
body
ever
beheld
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Elton
began
to
think
she
had
been
wrong
in
disclaiming
so
warmly
.
<EOS>
It
was
by
no
means
her
object
to
have
<EOS>
it
believed
that
her
sister
was
_
not
_
a
fine
lady
;
perhaps
there
was
want
of
spirit
in
the
pretence
of
it
;
 
and
she
was
considering
in
what
way
she
had
best
retract
,
when
Mr.
Weston
went
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Churchill
is
not
much
in
my
good
graces
,
as
you
may
suspect
 
<EOS>
but
this
is
quite
between
ourselves
.
<EOS>
She
is
very
fond
of
Frank
,
and
therefore
I
would
not
speak
ill
of
her
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
she
is
out
of
health
now
;
but
_
that
_
indeed
,
by
her
own
account
,
she
has
always
been
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
say
so
to
every
body
,
Mrs.
Elton
,
but
I
have
not
much
faith
in
Mrs.
Churchill
's
illness
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
she
is
really
ill
,
why
not
go
to
Bath
,
Mr.
Weston
?
 
<EOS>
To
Bath
,
or
to
Clifton
?
"
<EOS>
"
She
has
taken
it
into
her
head
that
Enscombe
is
too
cold
for
her
.
<EOS>
The
fact
is
,
I
suppose
,
that
she
is
tired
of
Enscombe
.
<EOS>
She
has
now
been
a
longer
time
stationary
there
,
than
she
ever
was
before
,
and
she
begins
to
want
change
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
retired
place
.
<EOS>
A
fine
place
,
but
very
retired
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Aye
 
like
Maple
Grove
,
I
dare
say
.
<EOS>
Nothing
can
stand
more
retired
from
the
road
than
Maple
Grove
.
<EOS>
Such
an
immense
plantation
all
round
it
!
<EOS>
You
seem
shut
out
from
every
thing
 
in
the
most
complete
retirement
.
 
<EOS>
And
Mrs.
Churchill
probably
has
not
health
or
spirits
like
Selina
to
enjoy
that
sort
of
seclusion
.
<EOS>
Or
,
perhaps
she
may
not
have
resources
enough
in
herself
to
be
qualified
for
a
country
life
.
<EOS>
I
always
say
a
woman
can
not
have
too
many
resources
 
<EOS>
and
I
feel
very
thankful
that
I
have
so
many
myself
as
to
be
quite
independent
of
society
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Frank
was
here
in
February
for
a
fortnight
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
So
I
remember
to
have
heard
.
<EOS>
He
will
find
an
_
addition
_
to
the
society
of
Highbury
when
he
comes
again
;
that
is
,
if
I
may
presume
to
call
myself
an
addition
.
<EOS>
But
perhaps
he
may
never
have
heard
of
there
being
such
a
creature
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
was
too
loud
a
call
for
a
compliment
to
be
passed
by
,
and
Mr.
Weston
,
with
a
very
good
grace
,
immediately
exclaimed
,
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
madam
!
<EOS>
Nobody
but
yourself
could
imagine
such
a
thing
possible
.
<EOS>
Not
heard
of
you
!
 
<EOS>
I
believe
Mrs.
Weston
's
letters
lately
have
been
full
of
very
little
else
than
Mrs.
Elton
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
had
done
his
duty
and
could
return
to
his
son
.
  
<EOS>
"
When
Frank
left
us
,
"
continued
he
,
"
it
was
quite
uncertain
when
we
might
see
him
again
,
which
makes
this
day
's
news
doubly
welcome
.
<EOS>
It
has
been
completely
unexpected
.
<EOS>
That
is
,
_
I
_
always
had
a
strong
persuasion
he
would
be
here
again
soon
<EOS>
,
I
was
sure
something
favourable
would
turn
up
 
<EOS>
but
nobody
believed
me
.
<EOS>
He
and
Mrs.
Weston
were
both
dreadfully
desponding
.
<EOS>
"
How
could
he
contrive
to
come
?
<EOS>
And
how
could
it
be
supposed
that
his
uncle
and
aunt
would
spare
him
again
?
"
<EOS>
and
so
forth
 
<EOS>
I
always
felt
that
something
would
happen
in
our
favour
;
and
so
it
has
,
you
see
.
<EOS>
I
have
observed
,
Mrs.
Elton
,
in
the
course
of
my
life
,
that
if
things
are
going
untowardly
one
month
,
they
are
sure
to
mend
the
next
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
true
,
Mr.
Weston
,
perfectly
true
.
<EOS>
It
is
just
what
I
used
to
say
to
a
certain
gentleman
in
company
in
the
days
of
courtship
,
when
,
because
things
did
not
go
quite
right
,
did
not
proceed
with
all
the
rapidity
which
suited
his
feelings
,
he
was
apt
to
be
in
despair
,
and
exclaim
that
he
was
sure
at
this
rate
it
would
be
_
<EOS>
May
_
before
Hymen
's
saffron
robe
would
be
put
on
for
us
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
the
pains
I
have
been
at
to
dispel
those
gloomy
ideas
and
give
him
cheerfuller
views
!
<EOS>
The
carriage
 
we
had
disappointments
about
the
carriage
;
 
<EOS>
one
morning
,
I
remember
,
he
came
to
me
quite
in
despair
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
was
stopped
by
a
slight
fit
of
coughing
,
and
Mr.
Weston
instantly
seized
the
opportunity
of
going
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
were
mentioning
<EOS>
May.
May
is
the
very
month
which
Mrs.
Churchill
is
ordered
,
or
has
ordered
herself
,
to
spend
in
some
warmer
place
than
Enscombe
 
in
short
,
to
spend
in
London
;
so
that
we
have
the
agreeable
prospect
of
frequent
visits
from
Frank
the
whole
spring
 
precisely
the
season
of
the
year
which
one
should
have
chosen
for
it
:
<EOS>
days
almost
at
the
longest
;
weather
genial
and
pleasant
,
always
inviting
one
out
,
and
never
too
hot
for
exercise
.
<EOS>
When
he
was
here
before
,
we
made
the
best
of
it
;
but
there
was
a
good
deal
of
wet
,
damp
,
cheerless
weather
;
there
always
is
in
February
,
you
know
,
and
we
could
not
do
half
that
we
intended
.
<EOS>
Now
will
be
the
time
.
<EOS>
This
will
be
complete
enjoyment
;
and
I
do
not
know
,
Mrs.
Elton
,
whether
the
uncertainty
of
our
meetings
,
the
sort
of
constant
expectation
there
will
be
of
his
coming
in
to
-
day
or
to
-
morrow
,
and
at
any
hour
,
may
not
be
more
friendly
to
happiness
than
having
him
actually
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
I
think
it
is
so
.
<EOS>
I
think
it
is
the
state
of
mind
which
gives
most
spirit
and
delight
.
<EOS>
I
hope
you
will
be
pleased
with
my
son
;
but
you
must
not
expect
a
prodigy
.
<EOS>
He
is
generally
thought
a
fine
young
man
,
but
do
not
expect
a
prodigy
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Weston
's
partiality
for
him
is
very
great
,
and
,
as
you
may
suppose
,
most
gratifying
to
me
.
<EOS>
She
thinks
nobody
equal
to
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
assure
you
,
Mr.
Weston
,
I
have
very
little
doubt
that
my
opinion
will
be
decidedly
in
his
favour
.
<EOS>
I
have
heard
so
much
in
praise
of
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
it
is
fair
to
observe
,
that
I
am
one
of
those
who
always
judge
for
themselves
,
and
are
by
no
means
implicitly
guided
by
others
.
<EOS>
I
give
you
notice
that
as
I
find
your
son
,
so
I
shall
judge
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
no
flatterer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Weston
was
musing
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
,
"
said
he
presently
,
"
I
have
not
been
severe
upon
poor
Mrs.
Churchill
.
<EOS>
If
she
is
ill
I
should
be
sorry
to
do
her
injustice
;
but
there
are
some
traits
in
her
character
which
make
it
difficult
for
me
to
speak
of
her
with
the
forbearance
I
could
wish
.
<EOS>
You
can
not
be
ignorant
,
Mrs.
Elton
,
of
my
connexion
with
the
family
,
nor
of
the
treatment
I
have
met
with
;
and
,
between
ourselves
,
the
whole
blame
of
it
is
to
be
laid
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
was
the
instigator
.
<EOS>
Frank
's
mother
would
never
have
been
slighted
as
she
was
but
for
her
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Churchill
has
pride
;
but
his
pride
is
nothing
to
his
wife
's
:
his
is
a
quiet
,
indolent
,
gentlemanlike
sort
of
pride
that
would
harm
nobody
,
and
only
make
himself
a
little
helpless
and
tiresome
;
but
her
pride
is
arrogance
and
insolence
!
<EOS>
And
what
inclines
one
less
to
bear
,
she
has
no
fair
pretence
of
family
or
blood
.
<EOS>
She
was
nobody
when
he
married
her
,
barely
the
daughter
of
a
gentleman
;
but
ever
since
her
being
turned
into
a
Churchill
she
has
out
-
Churchill'd
them
all
in
high
and
mighty
claims
:
<EOS>
but
in
herself
,
I
assure
you
,
she
is
an
upstart
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Only
think
!
<EOS>
well
,
that
must
be
infinitely
provoking
!
<EOS>
I
have
quite
a
horror
of
upstarts
.
<EOS>
Maple
Grove
has
given
me
a
thorough
disgust
to
people
of
that
sort
;
for
there
is
a
family
in
that
neighbourhood
who
are
such
an
annoyance
to
my
brother
and
sister
from
the
airs
they
give
themselves
!
<EOS>
Your
description
of
Mrs.
Churchill
made
me
think
of
them
directly
.
<EOS>
People
of
the
name
of
Tupman
,
very
lately
settled
there
,
and
encumbered
with
many
low
connexions
,
but
giving
themselves
immense
airs
,
and
expecting
to
be
on
a
footing
with
the
old
established
families
.
<EOS>
A
year
and
a
half
is
the
very
utmost
that
they
can
have
lived
at
West
Hall
;
and
how
they
got
their
fortune
nobody
knows
.
<EOS>
They
came
from
Birmingham
,
which
is
not
a
place
to
promise
much
,
you
know
,
Mr.
Weston
.
<EOS>
One
has
not
great
hopes
from
Birmingham
.
<EOS>
I
always
say
there
is
something
direful
in
the
sound
:
but
nothing
more
is
positively
known
of
the
Tupmans
,
though
a
good
many
things
I
assure
you
are
suspected
;
and
yet
by
their
manners
they
evidently
think
themselves
equal
even
to
my
brother
,
Mr.
Suckling
,
who
happens
to
be
one
of
their
nearest
neighbours
.
<EOS>
It
is
infinitely
too
bad
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Suckling
,
who
has
been
eleven
years
a
resident
at
Maple
Grove
,
and
whose
father
had
it
before
him
 
<EOS>
I
believe
,
at
least
 
I
am
almost
sure
that
old
Mr.
Suckling
had
completed
the
purchase
before
his
death
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
They
were
interrupted
.
<EOS>
Tea
was
carrying
round
,
and
Mr.
Weston
,
having
said
all
that
he
wanted
,
soon
took
the
opportunity
of
walking
away
.
  
<EOS>
After
tea
,
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Weston
,
and
Mr.
Elton
sat
down
with
Mr.
Woodhouse
to
cards
.
<EOS>
The
remaining
five
were
left
to
their
own
powers
,
and
Emma
doubted
their
getting
on
very
well
;
for
Mr.
Knightley
seemed
little
disposed
for
conversation
;
Mrs.
Elton
was
wanting
notice
,
which
nobody
had
inclination
to
pay
,
and
she
was
herself
in
a
worry
of
spirits
which
would
have
made
her
prefer
being
silent
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
John
Knightley
proved
more
talkative
than
his
brother
.
<EOS>
He
was
to
leave
them
early
the
next
day
;
and
he
soon
began
with
    
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Emma
,
I
do
not
believe
I
have
any
thing
more
to
say
about
the
boys
;
but
you
have
your
sister
's
letter
,
and
every
thing
is
down
at
full
length
there
<EOS>
we
may
be
sure
.
<EOS>
My
charge
would
be
much
more
concise
than
her
's
,
and
probably
not
much
in
the
same
spirit
;
all
that
I
have
to
recommend
being
comprised
in
,
do
not
spoil
them
,
and
do
not
physic
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
rather
hope
to
satisfy
you
both
,
"
said
Emma
,
"
for
I
shall
do
all
in
my
power
to
make
them
happy
,
which
will
be
enough
for
Isabella
;
and
happiness
must
preclude
false
indulgence
and
physic
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
if
you
find
them
troublesome
,
you
must
send
them
home
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
very
likely
.
<EOS>
You
think
so
,
do
not
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
I
am
aware
that
they
may
be
too
noisy
for
your
father
 
or
even
may
be
some
encumbrance
to
you
,
if
your
visiting
engagements
continue
to
increase
as
much
as
they
have
done
lately
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Increase
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Certainly
;
you
must
be
sensible
that
the
last
half
-
year
has
made
a
great
difference
in
your
way
of
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Difference
!
<EOS>
No
indeed
I
am
not
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
can
be
no
doubt
of
your
being
much
more
engaged
with
company
than
you
used
to
be
.
<EOS>
Witness
this
very
time
.
<EOS>
Here
am
<EOS>
I
come
down
for
only
one
day
,
and
you
are
engaged
with
a
dinner
-
party
!
 
<EOS>
When
did
it
happen
before
,
or
any
thing
like
it
?
<EOS>
Your
neighbourhood
is
increasing
,
and
you
mix
more
with
it
.
<EOS>
A
little
while
ago
,
every
letter
to
Isabella
brought
an
account
of
fresh
gaieties
;
dinners
at
Mr.
Cole
's
,
or
balls
at
the
Crown
.
<EOS>
The
difference
which
Randalls
,
Randalls
alone
makes
in
your
goings
-
on
,
is
very
great
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
his
brother
quickly
,
"
it
is
Randalls
that
does
it
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
well
 
and
as
Randalls
,
I
suppose
,
is
not
likely
to
have
less
influence
than
heretofore
,
it
strikes
me
as
a
possible
thing
,
Emma
,
that
Henry
and
John
may
be
sometimes
in
the
way
.
<EOS>
And
if
they
are
,
I
only
beg
you
to
send
them
home
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
cried
Mr.
Knightley
,
"
that
need
not
be
the
consequence
.
<EOS>
Let
them
be
sent
to
Donwell
.
<EOS>
I
shall
certainly
be
at
leisure
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
word
,
"
exclaimed
Emma
,
"
you
amuse
me
!
<EOS>
I
should
like
to
know
how
many
of
all
my
numerous
engagements
take
place
without
your
being
of
the
party
;
and
why
I
am
to
be
supposed
in
danger
of
wanting
leisure
to
attend
to
the
little
boys
.
<EOS>
These
amazing
engagements
of
mine
 
<EOS>
what
have
they
been
?
<EOS>
Dining
once
with
the
Coles
 
and
having
a
ball
talked
of
,
which
never
took
place
.
<EOS>
I
can
understand
you
 
(
nodding
at
Mr.
John
Knightley
)
 
<EOS>
your
good
fortune
in
meeting
with
so
many
of
your
friends
at
once
here
,
delights
you
too
much
to
pass
unnoticed
.
<EOS>
But
you
,
(
turning
to
Mr.
Knightley
,
)
who
know
how
very
,
very
seldom
I
am
ever
two
hours
from
Hartfield
,
why
you
should
foresee
such
a
series
of
dissipation
for
me
,
I
can
not
imagine
.
<EOS>
And
as
to
my
dear
little
boys
,
I
must
say
,
that
if
Aunt
Emma
has
not
time
for
them
,
I
do
not
think
they
would
fare
much
better
with
Uncle
Knightley
,
who
is
absent
from
home
about
five
hours
where
she
is
absent
one
 
and
who
,
when
he
is
at
home
,
is
either
reading
to
himself
or
settling
his
accounts
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Knightley
seemed
to
be
trying
not
to
smile
;
and
succeeded
without
difficulty
,
upon
Mrs.
Elton
's
beginning
to
talk
to
him
.
      
<EOS>
A
very
little
quiet
reflection
was
enough
to
satisfy
Emma
as
to
the
nature
of
her
agitation
on
hearing
this
news
of
Frank
Churchill
.
<EOS>
She
was
soon
convinced
that
it
was
not
for
herself
she
was
feeling
at
all
apprehensive
or
embarrassed
;
it
was
for
him
.
<EOS>
Her
own
attachment
had
really
subsided
into
a
mere
nothing
;
it
was
not
worth
thinking
of
;
 
but
if
he
,
who
had
undoubtedly
been
always
so
much
the
most
in
love
of
the
two
,
were
to
be
returning
with
the
same
warmth
of
sentiment
which
he
had
taken
away
,
it
would
be
very
distressing
.
<EOS>
If
a
separation
of
two
months
should
not
have
cooled
him
,
there
were
dangers
and
evils
before
her
:
 
<EOS>
caution
for
him
and
for
herself
would
be
necessary
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
mean
to
have
her
own
affections
entangled
again
,
and
it
would
be
incumbent
on
her
to
avoid
any
encouragement
of
his
.
  
<EOS>
She
wished
she
might
be
able
to
keep
him
from
an
absolute
declaration
.
<EOS>
That
would
be
so
very
painful
a
conclusion
of
their
present
acquaintance
!
<EOS>
and
yet
,
she
could
not
help
rather
anticipating
something
decisive
.
<EOS>
She
felt
as
if
the
spring
would
not
pass
without
bringing
a
crisis
,
an
event
,
a
something
to
alter
her
present
composed
and
tranquil
state
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
not
very
long
,
though
rather
longer
than
Mr.
Weston
had
foreseen
,
before
she
had
the
power
of
forming
some
opinion
of
Frank
Churchill
's
feelings
.
<EOS>
The
Enscombe
family
were
not
in
town
quite
so
soon
as
had
been
imagined
,
but
he
was
at
Highbury
very
soon
afterwards
.
<EOS>
He
rode
down
for
a
couple
of
hours
;
he
could
not
yet
do
more
;
but
as
he
came
from
Randalls
immediately
to
Hartfield
,
she
could
then
exercise
all
her
quick
observation
,
and
speedily
determine
how
he
was
influenced
,
and
how
she
must
act
.
<EOS>
They
met
with
the
utmost
friendliness
.
<EOS>
There
could
be
no
doubt
of
his
great
pleasure
in
seeing
her
.
<EOS>
But
she
had
an
almost
instant
doubt
of
his
caring
for
her
as
he
had
done
,
of
his
feeling
the
same
tenderness
in
the
same
degree
.
<EOS>
She
watched
him
well
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
clear
thing
he
was
less
in
love
than
he
had
been
.
<EOS>
Absence
,
with
the
conviction
probably
of
her
indifference
,
had
produced
this
very
natural
and
very
desirable
effect
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
in
high
spirits
;
as
ready
to
talk
and
laugh
as
ever
,
and
seemed
delighted
to
speak
of
his
former
visit
,
and
recur
to
old
stories
:
and
he
was
not
without
agitation
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
in
his
calmness
that
she
read
his
comparative
difference
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
calm
;
his
spirits
were
evidently
fluttered
;
there
was
restlessness
about
him
.
<EOS>
Lively
as
he
was
,
it
seemed
a
liveliness
that
did
not
satisfy
himself
;
but
what
decided
her
belief
on
the
subject
,
was
his
staying
only
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
and
hurrying
away
to
make
other
calls
in
Highbury
.
"
<EOS>
He
had
seen
a
group
of
old
acquaintance
in
the
street
as
he
passed
 
he
had
not
stopped
,
he
would
not
stop
for
more
than
a
word
 
<EOS>
but
he
had
the
vanity
to
think
they
would
be
disappointed
if
he
did
not
call
,
and
much
as
he
wished
to
stay
longer
at
Hartfield
,
he
must
hurry
off
.
<EOS>
"
She
had
no
doubt
as
to
his
being
less
in
love
 
<EOS>
but
neither
his
agitated
spirits
,
nor
his
hurrying
away
,
seemed
like
a
perfect
cure
;
and
she
was
rather
inclined
to
think
it
implied
a
dread
of
her
returning
power
,
and
a
discreet
resolution
of
not
trusting
himself
with
her
long
.
  
<EOS>
This
was
the
only
visit
from
Frank
Churchill
in
the
course
of
ten
days
.
<EOS>
He
was
often
hoping
,
intending
to
come
 
but
was
always
prevented
.
<EOS>
His
aunt
could
not
bear
to
have
him
leave
her
.
<EOS>
Such
was
his
own
account
at
Randall
's
.
<EOS>
If
he
were
quite
sincere
,
if
he
really
tried
to
come
,
it
was
to
be
inferred
that
Mrs.
Churchill
's
removal
to
London
had
been
of
no
service
to
the
wilful
or
nervous
part
of
her
disorder
.
<EOS>
That
she
was
really
ill
was
very
certain
;
he
had
declared
himself
convinced
of
it
,
at
Randalls
.
<EOS>
Though
much
might
be
fancy
,
he
could
not
doubt
,
when
he
looked
back
,
that
she
was
in
a
weaker
state
of
health
than
she
had
been
half
a
year
ago
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
believe
it
to
proceed
from
any
thing
that
care
and
medicine
might
not
remove
,
or
at
least
that
she
might
not
have
many
years
of
existence
before
her
;
but
he
could
not
be
prevailed
on
,
by
all
his
father
's
doubts
,
to
say
that
her
complaints
were
merely
imaginary
,
or
that
she
was
as
strong
as
ever
.
  
<EOS>
It
soon
appeared
that
London
was
not
the
place
for
her
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
endure
its
noise
.
<EOS>
Her
nerves
were
under
continual
irritation
and
suffering
;
and
by
the
ten
days
'
end
,
her
nephew
's
letter
to
Randalls
communicated
a
change
of
plan
.
<EOS>
They
were
going
to
remove
immediately
to
Richmond
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Churchill
had
been
recommended
to
the
medical
skill
of
an
eminent
person
there
,
and
had
otherwise
a
fancy
for
the
place
.
<EOS>
A
ready
-
furnished
house
in
a
favourite
spot
was
engaged
,
and
much
benefit
expected
from
the
change
.
  
<EOS>
Emma
heard
that
Frank
wrote
in
the
highest
spirits
of
this
arrangement
,
and
seemed
most
fully
to
appreciate
the
blessing
of
having
two
months
before
him
of
such
near
neighbourhood
to
many
dear
friends
 
for
the
house
was
taken
for
May
and
June
.
<EOS>
She
was
told
that
now
he
wrote
with
the
greatest
confidence
of
being
often
with
them
,
almost
as
often
as
he
could
even
wish
.
  
<EOS>
Emma
saw
how
Mr.
Weston
understood
these
joyous
prospects
.
<EOS>
He
was
considering
her
as
the
source
of
all
the
happiness
they
offered
.
<EOS>
She
hoped
it
was
not
so
.
<EOS>
Two
months
must
bring
it
to
the
proof
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Weston
's
own
happiness
was
indisputable
.
<EOS>
He
was
quite
delighted
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
very
circumstance
he
could
have
wished
for
.
<EOS>
Now
,
it
would
be
really
having
Frank
in
their
neighbourhood
.
<EOS>
What
were
nine
miles
to
a
young
man
?
 
<EOS>
An
hour
's
ride
.
<EOS>
He
would
be
always
coming
over
.
<EOS>
The
difference
in
that
respect
of
Richmond
and
London
was
enough
to
make
the
whole
difference
of
seeing
him
always
and
seeing
him
never
.
<EOS>
Sixteen
miles
 
nay
,
eighteen
 
<EOS>
it
must
be
full
eighteen
to
Manchester
-
street
 
<EOS>
was
a
serious
obstacle
.
<EOS>
Were
he
ever
able
to
get
away
,
the
day
would
be
spent
in
coming
and
returning
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
comfort
in
having
him
in
London
;
he
might
as
well
be
at
Enscombe
;
but
Richmond
was
the
very
distance
for
easy
intercourse
.
<EOS>
Better
than
nearer
!
  
<EOS>
One
good
thing
was
immediately
brought
to
a
certainty
by
this
removal
,
 
the
ball
at
the
Crown
.
<EOS>
It
had
not
been
forgotten
before
,
but
it
had
been
soon
acknowledged
vain
to
attempt
to
fix
a
day
.
<EOS>
Now
,
however
,
it
was
absolutely
to
be
;
every
preparation
was
resumed
,
and
very
soon
after
the
Churchills
had
removed
to
Richmond
,
a
few
lines
from
Frank
,
to
say
that
his
aunt
felt
already
much
better
for
the
change
,
and
that
he
had
no
doubt
of
being
able
to
join
them
for
twenty
-
four
hours
at
any
given
time
,
induced
them
to
name
as
early
a
day
as
possible
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Weston
's
ball
was
to
be
a
real
thing
.
<EOS>
A
very
few
to
-
morrows
stood
between
the
young
people
of
Highbury
and
happiness
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Woodhouse
was
resigned
.
<EOS>
The
time
of
year
lightened
the
evil
to
him
.
<EOS>
May
was
better
for
every
thing
than
February
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bates
was
engaged
to
spend
the
evening
at
Hartfield
,
James
had
due
notice
,
and
he
sanguinely
hoped
that
neither
dear
little
Henry
nor
dear
little
John
would
have
any
thing
the
matter
with
them
,
while
dear
Emma
were
gone
.
    
<EOS>
No
misfortune
occurred
,
again
to
prevent
the
ball
.
<EOS>
The
day
approached
,
the
day
arrived
;
and
after
a
morning
of
some
anxious
watching
,
Frank
Churchill
,
in
all
the
certainty
of
his
own
self
,
reached
Randalls
before
dinner
,
and
every
thing
was
safe
.
  
<EOS>
No
second
meeting
had
there
yet
been
between
him
and
Emma
.
<EOS>
The
room
at
the
Crown
was
to
witness
it
;
 
but
it
would
be
better
than
a
common
meeting
in
a
crowd
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Weston
had
been
so
very
earnest
in
his
entreaties
for
her
arriving
there
as
soon
as
possible
after
themselves
,
for
the
purpose
of
taking
her
opinion
as
to
the
propriety
and
comfort
of
the
rooms
before
any
other
persons
came
,
that
she
could
not
refuse
him
,
and
must
therefore
spend
some
quiet
interval
in
the
young
man
's
company
.
<EOS>
She
was
to
convey
Harriet
,
and
they
drove
to
the
Crown
in
good
time
,
the
Randalls
party
just
sufficiently
before
them
.
  
<EOS>
Frank
Churchill
seemed
to
have
been
on
the
watch
;
and
though
he
did
not
say
much
,
his
eyes
declared
that
he
meant
to
have
a
delightful
evening
.
<EOS>
They
all
walked
about
together
,
to
see
that
every
thing
was
as
it
should
be
;
and
within
a
few
minutes
were
joined
by
the
contents
of
another
carriage
,
which
Emma
could
not
hear
the
sound
of
at
first
,
without
great
surprize
.
"
<EOS>
So
unreasonably
early
!
<EOS>
"
she
was
going
to
exclaim
;
but
she
presently
found
that
it
was
a
family
of
old
friends
,
who
were
coming
,
like
herself
,
by
particular
desire
,
to
help
Mr.
Weston
's
judgment
;
and
they
were
so
very
closely
followed
by
another
carriage
of
cousins
,
who
had
been
entreated
to
come
early
with
the
same
distinguishing
earnestness
,
on
the
same
errand
,
<EOS>
that
it
seemed
as
if
half
the
company
might
soon
be
collected
together
for
the
purpose
of
preparatory
inspection
.
  
<EOS>
Emma
perceived
that
her
taste
was
not
the
only
taste
on
which
Mr.
Weston
depended
,
and
felt
,
that
to
be
the
favourite
and
intimate
of
a
man
who
had
so
many
intimates
and
confidantes
,
was
not
the
very
first
distinction
in
the
scale
of
vanity
.
<EOS>
She
liked
his
open
manners
,
but
a
little
less
of
open
-
heartedness
would
have
made
him
a
higher
character
.
 
<EOS>
General
benevolence
,
but
not
general
friendship
,
made
a
man
what
he
ought
to
be
.
 
<EOS>
She
could
fancy
such
a
man
.
<EOS>
The
whole
party
walked
about
,
and
looked
,
and
praised
again
;
and
then
,
having
nothing
else
to
do
,
formed
a
sort
of
half
-
circle
round
the
fire
,
to
observe
in
their
various
modes
,
till
other
subjects
were
started
,
that
,
though
_
May
_
,
a
fire
in
the
evening
was
still
very
pleasant
.
  
<EOS>
Emma
found
that
it
was
not
Mr.
Weston
's
fault
that
the
number
of
privy
councillors
was
not
yet
larger
.
<EOS>
They
had
stopped
at
Mrs.
Bates
's
door
to
offer
the
use
of
their
carriage
,
but
the
aunt
and
niece
were
to
be
brought
by
the
Eltons
.
  
<EOS>
Frank
was
standing
by
her
,
but
not
steadily
;
there
was
a
restlessness
,
which
shewed
a
mind
not
at
ease
.
<EOS>
He
was
looking
about
,
he
was
going
to
the
door
,
he
was
watching
for
the
sound
of
other
carriages
,
 
impatient
to
begin
,
or
afraid
of
being
always
near
her
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Elton
was
spoken
of
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
she
must
be
here
soon
,
"
said
he
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
a
great
curiosity
to
see
Mrs.
Elton
,
I
have
heard
so
much
of
her
.
<EOS>
It
can
not
be
long
,
I
think
,
before
she
comes
.
"
  
<EOS>
A
carriage
was
heard
.
<EOS>
He
was
on
the
move
immediately
;
but
coming
back
,
said
,
  
"
I
am
forgetting
that
I
am
not
acquainted
with
her
.
<EOS>
I
have
never
seen
either
Mr.
or
Mrs.
Elton
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
business
to
put
myself
forward
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Elton
appeared
;
and
all
the
smiles
and
the
proprieties
passed
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
Miss
Bates
and
Miss
Fairfax
!
"
said
Mr.
Weston
,
looking
about
.
<EOS>
"
We
thought
you
were
to
bring
them
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
mistake
had
been
slight
.
<EOS>
The
carriage
was
sent
for
them
now
.
<EOS>
Emma
longed
to
know
what
Frank
's
first
opinion
of
Mrs.
Elton
might
be
;
how
he
was
affected
by
the
studied
elegance
of
her
dress
,
and
her
smiles
of
graciousness
.
<EOS>
He
was
immediately
qualifying
himself
to
form
an
opinion
,
by
giving
her
very
proper
attention
,
after
the
introduction
had
passed
.
  
<EOS>
In
a
few
minutes
the
carriage
returned
.
 
<EOS>
Somebody
talked
of
rain
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
see
that
there
are
umbrellas
,
sir
,
"
said
Frank
to
his
father
:
"
Miss
Bates
must
not
be
forgotten
:
"
and
away
he
went
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Weston
was
following
;
but
Mrs.
Elton
detained
him
,
to
gratify
him
by
her
opinion
of
his
son
;
and
so
briskly
did
she
begin
,
that
the
young
man
himself
,
though
by
no
means
moving
slowly
,
could
hardly
be
out
of
hearing
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
very
fine
young
man
indeed
,
Mr.
Weston
.
<EOS>
You
know
I
candidly
told
you
I
should
form
my
own
opinion
;
and
I
am
happy
to
say
that
I
am
extremely
pleased
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
believe
me
.
<EOS>
I
never
compliment
.
<EOS>
I
think
him
a
very
handsome
young
man
,
and
his
manners
are
precisely
what
I
like
and
approve
 
so
truly
<EOS>
the
gentleman
,
without
the
least
conceit
or
puppyism
.
<EOS>
You
must
know
I
have
a
vast
dislike
to
puppies
 
quite
a
horror
of
them
.
<EOS>
They
were
never
tolerated
at
Maple
Grove
.
<EOS>
Neither
Mr.
Suckling
nor
me
had
ever
any
patience
with
them
;
and
we
used
sometimes
to
say
very
cutting
things
!
<EOS>
Selina
,
who
is
mild
almost
to
a
fault
,
bore
with
them
much
better
.
"
  
<EOS>
While
she
talked
of
his
son
,
Mr.
Weston
's
attention
was
chained
;
but
when
she
got
to
Maple
Grove
,
he
could
recollect
that
there
were
ladies
just
arriving
to
be
attended
to
,
and
with
happy
smiles
must
hurry
away
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Elton
turned
to
Mrs.
Weston
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
doubt
of
its
being
our
carriage
with
Miss
Bates
and
Jane
.
<EOS>
Our
coachman
and
horses
are
so
extremely
expeditious
!
 
<EOS>
I
believe
we
drive
faster
than
any
body
.
 
<EOS>
What
a
pleasure
<EOS>
it
is
to
send
one
's
carriage
for
a
friend
!
 
<EOS>
I
understand
you
were
so
kind
as
to
offer
,
but
<EOS>
another
time
it
will
be
quite
unnecessary
.
<EOS>
You
may
be
very
sure
I
shall
always
take
care
of
_
them
_
.
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Bates
and
Miss
Fairfax
,
escorted
by
the
two
gentlemen
,
walked
into
the
room
;
and
Mrs.
Elton
seemed
to
think
it
as
much
her
duty
as
Mrs.
Weston
's
to
receive
them
.
<EOS>
Her
gestures
and
movements
might
be
understood
by
any
one
who
looked
on
like
Emma
;
but
her
words
,
every
body
's
words
,
were
soon
lost
under
the
incessant
flow
of
Miss
Bates
,
who
came
in
talking
,
and
had
not
finished
her
speech
under
many
minutes
after
her
being
admitted
into
the
circle
at
the
fire
.
<EOS>
As
the
door
opened
she
was
heard
,
  
"
So
very
obliging
of
you
!
 
<EOS>
No
rain
at
all
.
<EOS>
Nothing
to
signify
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
care
for
myself
.
<EOS>
Quite
thick
shoes
.
<EOS>
And
Jane
declares
 
Well
!
 
<EOS>
(
as
soon
as
she
was
within
the
door
)
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
This
is
brilliant
indeed
!
 
<EOS>
This
is
admirable
!
 
<EOS>
Excellently
contrived
,
upon
my
word
.
<EOS>
Nothing
wanting
.
<EOS>
Could
not
have
imagined
it
.
 
<EOS>
So
well
lighted
up
!
 
<EOS>
Jane
,
Jane
,
look
!
 
<EOS>
did
you
ever
see
any
thing
?
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
Mr.
Weston
,
you
must
really
have
had
Aladdin
's
lamp
.
<EOS>
Good
Mrs.
Stokes
would
not
know
her
own
room
again
.
<EOS>
I
saw
her
as
I
came
in
;
she
was
standing
in
the
entrance
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
Mrs.
Stokes
,
"
said
I
 
<EOS>
but
I
had
not
time
for
more
.
<EOS>
"
She
was
now
met
by
Mrs.
Weston
.
 
<EOS>
"
Very
well
,
I
thank
you
,
ma'am
.
<EOS>
I
hope
you
are
quite
well
.
<EOS>
Very
happy
to
hear
it
.
<EOS>
So
afraid
you
might
have
a
headache
!
 
<EOS>
seeing
you
pass
by
so
often
,
and
knowing
how
much
trouble
you
must
have
.
<EOS>
Delighted
to
hear
it
indeed
.
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
dear
Mrs.
Elton
,
so
obliged
to
you
for
the
carriage
!
 
<EOS>
excellent
time
.
<EOS>
Jane
and
I
quite
ready
.
<EOS>
Did
not
keep
the
horses
a
moment
.
<EOS>
Most
comfortable
carriage
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
and
I
am
sure
our
thanks
are
due
to
you
,
Mrs.
Weston
,
on
that
score
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Elton
had
most
kindly
sent
Jane
a
note
,
or
we
should
have
been
.
 
<EOS>
But
two
such
offers
in
one
day
!
 
<EOS>
Never
were
such
neighbours
.
<EOS>
I
said
to
my
mother
,
"
Upon
my
word
,
ma'am
 
.
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
my
mother
is
remarkably
well
.
<EOS>
Gone
to
Mr.
Woodhouse
's
.
<EOS>
I
made
her
take
her
shawl
 
for
the
evenings
are
not
warm
 
<EOS>
her
large
new
shawl
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Dixon
's
wedding
-
present
.
 
<EOS>
So
kind
of
her
to
think
of
my
mother
!
<EOS>
Bought
at
Weymouth
,
you
know
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Dixon
's
choice
.
<EOS>
There
were
three
others
,
Jane
says
,
which
they
hesitated
about
some
time
.
<EOS>
Colonel
Campbell
rather
preferred
an
olive
.
<EOS>
My
dear
Jane
,
are
you
sure
you
did
not
wet
your
feet
?
 
<EOS>
It
was
but
a
drop
or
two
,
but
I
am
so
afraid
:
 
<EOS>
but
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
was
so
extremely
 
<EOS>
and
there
was
a
mat
to
step
upon
 
<EOS>
I
shall
never
forget
his
extreme
politeness
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
,
I
must
tell
you
my
mother
's
spectacles
have
never
been
in
fault
since
;
the
rivet
never
came
out
again
.
<EOS>
My
mother
often
talks
of
your
good
-
nature
.
<EOS>
Does
not
she
,
Jane
?
 
<EOS>
Do
not
we
often
talk
of
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
?
 
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
here
's
Miss
Woodhouse
.
 
<EOS>
Dear
Miss
Woodhouse
,
how
do
you
do
?
 
<EOS>
Very
well
I
thank
you
,
quite
well
.
<EOS>
This
is
meeting
quite
in
fairy
-
land
!
 
<EOS>
Such
a
transformation
!
 
<EOS>
Must
not
compliment
,
I
know
(
eyeing
Emma
most
complacently
)
 
<EOS>
that
would
be
rude
 
but
upon
my
word
,
Miss
Woodhouse
,
you
do
look
 
how
do
you
like
Jane
's
hair
?
 
<EOS>
You
are
a
judge
.
 
<EOS>
She
did
it
all
herself
.
<EOS>
Quite
wonderful
how
she
does
her
hair
!
 
<EOS>
No
hairdresser
from
London
<EOS>
I
think
could
.
 
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
Dr.
Hughes
<EOS>
I
declare
 
and
Mrs.
Hughes
.
<EOS>
Must
go
and
speak
to
Dr.
and
Mrs.
Hughes
for
a
moment
.
 
<EOS>
How
do
you
do
?
<EOS>
How
do
you
do
?
 
<EOS>
Very
well
,
I
thank
you
.
<EOS>
This
is
delightful
,
is
not
it
?
 
<EOS>
Where
's
dear
Mr.
Richard
?
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
there
he
is
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
disturb
him
.
<EOS>
Much
better
employed
talking
to
the
young
ladies
.
<EOS>
How
do
you
do
,
Mr.
Richard
?
 
<EOS>
I
saw
you
the
other
day
as
you
rode
through
the
town
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Otway
,
I
protest
!
 
<EOS>
and
good
Mr.
Otway
,
and
Miss
Otway
and
Miss
Caroline
.
 
<EOS>
Such
a
host
of
friends
!
 
<EOS>
and
Mr.
George
and
Mr.
Arthur
!
 
<EOS>
How
do
you
do
?
<EOS>
How
do
you
all
do
?
 
<EOS>
Quite
well
,
I
am
much
obliged
to
you
.
<EOS>
Never
better
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
I
hear
another
carriage
?
 
<EOS>
Who
can
this
be
?
 
<EOS>
very
likely
the
worthy
Coles
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
my
word
,
this
is
charming
to
be
standing
about
among
such
friends
!
<EOS>
And
such
a
noble
fire
!
 
<EOS>
I
am
quite
roasted
.
<EOS>
No
coffee
,
I
thank
you
,
for
me
 
never
take
coffee
.
 
<EOS>
A
little
tea
if
you
please
,
sir
,
by
and
bye
<EOS>
,
 
no
hurry
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
here
it
comes
.
<EOS>
Every
thing
so
good
!
"
  
<EOS>
Frank
Churchill
returned
to
his
station
by
Emma
;
and
as
soon
as
Miss
Bates
was
quiet
,
she
found
herself
necessarily
overhearing
the
discourse
of
Mrs.
Elton
and
Miss
Fairfax
,
who
were
standing
a
little
way
behind
her
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
thoughtful
.
<EOS>
Whether
he
were
overhearing
too
,
she
could
not
determine
.
<EOS>
After
a
good
many
compliments
to
Jane
on
her
dress
and
look
,
compliments
very
quietly
and
properly
taken
,
Mrs.
Elton
was
evidently
wanting
to
be
complimented
herself
 
and
it
was
,
"
How
do
you
like
my
gown
?
 
<EOS>
How
do
you
like
my
trimming
?
 
<EOS>
How
has
Wright
done
my
hair
?
"
 
with
many
other
relative
questions
,
all
answered
with
patient
politeness
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Elton
then
said
,
"
Nobody
can
think
less
of
dress
in
general
than
I
do
 
but
upon
such
an
occasion
as
this
,
when
every
body
's
eyes
are
so
much
upon
me
,
and
in
compliment
to
the
Westons
 
who
I
have
no
doubt
are
giving
this
ball
chiefly
to
do
<EOS>
me
honour
 
<EOS>
I
would
not
wish
to
be
inferior
to
others
.
<EOS>
And
I
see
very
few
pearls
in
the
room
except
mine
.
 
<EOS>
So
Frank
Churchill
is
a
capital
dancer
,
I
understand
.
 
<EOS>
We
shall
see
if
our
styles
suit
.
 
<EOS>
A
fine
young
man
certainly
is
Frank
Churchill
.
<EOS>
I
like
him
very
well
.
"
  
<EOS>
At
this
moment
Frank
began
talking
so
vigorously
,
that
Emma
could
not
but
imagine
he
had
overheard
his
own
praises
,
and
did
not
want
to
hear
more
;
 
and
the
voices
of
the
ladies
were
drowned
for
a
while
,
till
another
suspension
brought
Mrs.
Elton
's
tones
again
distinctly
forward
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Elton
had
just
joined
them
,
and
his
wife
was
exclaiming
,
  
"
Oh
!
<EOS>
you
have
found
us
out
at
last
,
have
you
,
in
our
seclusion
?
 
<EOS>
I
was
this
moment
telling
Jane
<EOS>
,
I
thought
you
would
begin
to
be
impatient
for
tidings
of
us
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Jane
!
"
 
<EOS>
repeated
Frank
Churchill
,
with
a
look
of
surprize
and
displeasure
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
is
easy
 
but
Miss
Fairfax
does
not
disapprove
it
,
I
suppose
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
How
do
you
like
Mrs.
Elton
?
"
said
Emma
in
a
whisper
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
ungrateful
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ungrateful
!
 
<EOS>
What
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
"
Then
changing
from
a
frown
to
a
smile
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
do
not
tell
me
 
I
do
not
want
to
know
what
you
mean
.
 
<EOS>
Where
is
my
father
?
 
<EOS>
When
are
we
to
begin
dancing
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
could
hardly
understand
him
;
he
seemed
in
an
odd
humour
.
<EOS>
He
walked
off
to
find
his
father
,
but
was
quickly
back
again
with
both
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Weston
.
<EOS>
He
had
met
with
them
in
a
little
perplexity
,
which
must
be
laid
before
Emma
.
<EOS>
It
had
just
occurred
to
Mrs.
Weston
that
Mrs.
Elton
must
be
asked
to
begin
the
ball
;
that
she
would
expect
it
;
which
interfered
with
all
their
wishes
of
giving
Emma
that
distinction
.
 
<EOS>
Emma
heard
the
sad
truth
with
fortitude
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
are
we
to
do
for
a
proper
partner
for
her
?
"
said
Mr.
Weston
.
<EOS>
"
She
will
think
Frank
ought
to
ask
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
Frank
turned
instantly
to
Emma
,
to
claim
her
former
promise
;
and
boasted
himself
an
engaged
man
,
which
his
father
looked
his
most
perfect
approbation
of
 
and
it
then
appeared
that
Mrs.
Weston
was
wanting
_
him
_
to
dance
with
Mrs.
Elton
himself
,
and
that
their
business
was
to
help
to
persuade
him
into
it
,
which
was
done
pretty
soon
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Weston
and
Mrs.
Elton
led
the
way
,
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
and
Miss
Woodhouse
followed
.
<EOS>
Emma
must
submit
to
stand
second
to
Mrs.
Elton
,
though
she
had
always
considered
the
ball
as
peculiarly
for
her
.
<EOS>
It
was
almost
enough
to
make
her
think
of
marrying
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Elton
had
undoubtedly
the
advantage
,
at
this
time
,
in
vanity
completely
gratified
;
for
though
she
had
intended
to
begin
with
Frank
Churchill
,
she
could
not
lose
by
the
change
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Weston
might
be
his
son
's
superior
.
 
<EOS>
In
spite
of
this
little
rub
,
however
,
Emma
was
smiling
with
enjoyment
,
delighted
to
see
the
respectable
length
of
the
set
as
it
was
forming
,
and
to
feel
that
she
had
so
many
hours
of
unusual
festivity
before
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
more
disturbed
by
Mr.
Knightley
's
not
dancing
than
by
any
thing
else
.
 
<EOS>
There
he
was
,
among
the
standers
-
by
,
where
he
ought
not
to
be
;
he
ought
to
be
dancing
,
 
not
classing
himself
with
the
husbands
,
and
fathers
,
and
whist
-
players
,
who
were
pretending
to
feel
an
interest
in
the
dance
till
their
rubbers
were
made
up
,
 
so
young
as
he
looked
!
 
<EOS>
He
could
not
have
appeared
to
greater
advantage
perhaps
anywhere
,
than
where
he
had
placed
himself
.
<EOS>
His
tall
,
firm
,
upright
figure
,
among
the
bulky
forms
and
stooping
shoulders
of
the
elderly
men
,
was
such
as
Emma
felt
must
draw
every
body
's
eyes
;
and
,
excepting
her
own
partner
,
there
was
not
one
among
the
whole
row
of
young
men
who
could
be
compared
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
moved
a
few
steps
nearer
,
and
those
few
steps
were
enough
to
prove
in
how
gentlemanlike
a
manner
,
with
what
natural
grace
,
he
must
have
danced
,
<EOS>
would
he
but
take
the
trouble
.
 
<EOS>
Whenever
she
caught
his
eye
,
she
forced
him
to
smile
;
but
in
general
he
was
looking
grave
.
<EOS>
She
wished
he
could
love
a
ballroom
better
,
and
could
like
Frank
Churchill
better
.
 
<EOS>
He
seemed
often
observing
her
.
<EOS>
She
must
not
flatter
herself
that
he
thought
of
her
dancing
,
but
if
he
were
criticising
her
behaviour
,
she
did
not
feel
afraid
.
<EOS>
There
was
nothing
like
flirtation
between
her
and
her
partner
.
<EOS>
They
seemed
more
like
cheerful
,
easy
friends
,
than
lovers
.
<EOS>
That
Frank
Churchill
thought
less
of
her
than
he
had
done
,
was
indubitable
.
  
<EOS>
The
ball
proceeded
pleasantly
.
<EOS>
The
anxious
cares
,
the
incessant
attentions
of
Mrs.
Weston
,
were
not
thrown
away
.
<EOS>
Every
body
seemed
happy
;
and
the
praise
of
being
a
delightful
ball
,
which
is
seldom
bestowed
till
after
a
ball
has
ceased
to
be
,
was
repeatedly
given
in
the
very
beginning
of
the
existence
of
this
.
<EOS>
Of
very
important
,
very
recordable
events
,
it
was
not
more
productive
than
such
meetings
usually
are
.
<EOS>
There
was
one
,
however
,
which
Emma
thought
something
of
.
 
<EOS>
The
two
last
dances
before
supper
were
begun
,
and
Harriet
had
no
partner
;
 
the
only
young
lady
sitting
down
;
 
and
so
equal
<EOS>
had
been
hitherto
the
number
of
dancers
<EOS>
,
that
how
there
could
be
any
one
disengaged
was
the
wonder
!
 
<EOS>
But
Emma
's
wonder
lessened
soon
afterwards
,
on
seeing
Mr.
Elton
sauntering
about
.
<EOS>
He
would
not
ask
Harriet
to
dance
if
it
were
possible
to
be
avoided
:
she
was
sure
he
would
not
 
<EOS>
and
she
was
expecting
him
every
moment
to
escape
into
the
card
-
room
.
  
<EOS>
Escape
,
however
,
was
not
his
plan
.
<EOS>
He
came
to
the
part
of
the
room
where
the
sitters
-
by
were
collected
,
spoke
to
some
,
and
walked
about
in
front
of
them
,
as
if
to
shew
his
liberty
,
and
his
resolution
of
maintaining
it
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
omit
being
sometimes
directly
before
Miss
Smith
,
or
speaking
to
those
who
were
close
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
Emma
saw
it
.
<EOS>
She
was
not
yet
dancing
;
she
was
working
her
way
up
from
the
bottom
,
and
had
therefore
leisure
to
look
around
,
and
by
only
turning
her
head
a
little
she
saw
it
all
.
<EOS>
When
she
was
half
-
way
up
the
set
,
the
whole
group
were
exactly
behind
her
,
and
she
would
no
longer
allow
her
eyes
to
watch
;
but
Mr.
Elton
was
so
near
,
that
she
heard
every
syllable
of
a
dialogue
which
just
then
took
place
between
him
and
Mrs.
Weston
;
and
she
perceived
that
his
wife
,
who
was
standing
immediately
above
her
,
was
not
only
listening
also
,
but
even
encouraging
him
by
significant
glances
.
 
<EOS>
The
kind
-
hearted
,
gentle
Mrs.
Weston
had
left
her
seat
to
join
him
and
say
,
"
Do
not
you
dance
,
Mr.
Elton
?
"
to
which
his
prompt
reply
was
,
"
Most
readily
,
Mrs.
Weston
,
if
you
will
dance
with
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Me
!
 
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
no
 
I
would
get
you
a
better
partner
than
myself
.
<EOS>
I
am
no
dancer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
Mrs.
Gilbert
wishes
to
dance
,
"
said
he
,
"
I
shall
have
great
pleasure
<EOS>
,
I
am
sure
 
for
,
though
beginning
to
feel
myself
rather
an
old
married
man
,
and
that
my
dancing
days
are
over
,
it
would
give
me
very
great
pleasure
at
any
time
to
stand
up
with
an
old
friend
like
Mrs.
Gilbert
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Mrs.
Gilbert
does
not
mean
to
dance
,
but
there
is
a
young
lady
disengaged
whom
I
should
be
very
glad
to
see
dancing
 
Miss
Smith
.
"
<EOS>
"
Miss
Smith
!
 
<EOS>
oh
!
 
<EOS>
I
had
not
observed
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
extremely
obliging
 
and
if
I
were
not
an
old
married
man
.
 
<EOS>
But
my
dancing
days
are
over
,
Mrs.
Weston
.
<EOS>
You
will
excuse
me
.
<EOS>
Any
thing
else
I
should
be
most
happy
to
do
,
at
your
command
 
<EOS>
but
my
dancing
days
are
over
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Weston
said
no
more
;
and
Emma
could
imagine
with
what
surprize
and
mortification
she
must
be
returning
to
her
seat
.
<EOS>
This
was
Mr.
Elton
!
<EOS>
the
amiable
,
obliging
,
gentle
Mr.
Elton
.
 
<EOS>
She
looked
round
for
a
moment
;
he
had
joined
Mr.
Knightley
at
a
little
distance
,
and
was
arranging
himself
for
settled
conversation
,
while
smiles
of
high
glee
passed
between
him
and
his
wife
.
  
<EOS>
She
would
not
look
again
.
<EOS>
Her
heart
was
in
a
glow
,
and
she
feared
her
face
might
be
as
hot
.
  
<EOS>
In
another
moment
a
happier
sight
caught
her
;
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Knightley
leading
Harriet
to
the
set
!
 
<EOS>
Never
had
she
been
more
surprized
,
seldom
more
delighted
,
than
at
that
instant
.
<EOS>
She
was
all
pleasure
and
gratitude
,
both
for
Harriet
and
herself
,
and
longed
to
be
thanking
him
;
and
though
too
distant
for
speech
,
her
countenance
said
much
,
as
soon
as
she
could
catch
his
eye
again
.
  
<EOS>
His
dancing
proved
to
be
just
what
she
had
believed
it
,
extremely
good
;
and
Harriet
would
have
seemed
almost
too
lucky
,
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
cruel
state
of
things
before
,
and
for
the
very
complete
enjoyment
and
very
high
sense
of
the
distinction
which
her
happy
features
announced
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
thrown
away
on
her
<EOS>
,
she
bounded
higher
than
ever
,
flew
farther
down
the
middle
,
and
was
in
a
continual
course
of
smiles
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Elton
had
retreated
into
the
card
-
room
,
looking
(
Emma
trusted
)
very
foolish
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
think
he
was
quite
so
hardened
as
his
wife
,
though
growing
very
like
her
;
 
_
<EOS>
she
_
spoke
some
of
her
feelings
,
by
observing
audibly
to
her
partner
,
  
"
Knightley
has
taken
pity
on
poor
little
Miss
Smith
!
 
<EOS>
Very
good
-
natured
,
I
declare
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Supper
was
announced
.
<EOS>
The
move
began
;
and
Miss
Bates
might
be
heard
from
that
moment
,
without
interruption
,
till
her
being
seated
at
table
and
taking
up
her
spoon
.
  
<EOS>
"
Jane
,
Jane
,
my
dear
Jane
,
where
are
you
?
 
<EOS>
Here
is
your
tippet
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Weston
begs
you
to
put
on
your
tippet
.
<EOS>
She
says
she
is
afraid
there
will
be
draughts
in
the
passage
,
though
every
thing
has
been
done
 
One
door
nailed
up
 
Quantities
of
matting
 
<EOS>
My
dear
Jane
,
indeed
you
must
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Churchill
,
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
you
are
too
obliging
!
<EOS>
How
well
you
put
it
on
!
 
<EOS>
so
gratified
!
<EOS>
Excellent
dancing
indeed
!
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
my
dear
,
I
ran
home
,
as
I
said
I
should
,
to
help
grandmama
to
bed
,
and
got
back
again
,
and
nobody
missed
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
set
off
without
saying
a
word
,
just
as
I
told
you
.
<EOS>
Grandmama
was
quite
well
,
had
a
charming
evening
with
Mr.
Woodhouse
,
a
vast
deal
of
chat
,
and
backgammon
.
 
<EOS>
Tea
was
made
downstairs
,
biscuits
and
baked
apples
and
wine
before
she
came
away
:
amazing
luck
in
some
of
her
throws
:
and
she
inquired
a
great
deal
about
you
,
how
you
were
amused
,
and
who
were
your
partners
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
"
said
I
,
"
I
shall
not
forestall
Jane
;
I
left
her
dancing
with
Mr.
George
Otway
;
she
will
love
to
tell
you
all
about
it
herself
to
-
morrow
:
her
first
partner
was
Mr.
Elton
<EOS>
,
I
do
not
know
who
will
ask
her
next
,
perhaps
Mr.
William
Cox
.
<EOS>
"
My
dear
sir
,
you
are
too
obliging
.
 
<EOS>
Is
there
nobody
you
would
not
rather
?
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
helpless
.
<EOS>
Sir
,
you
are
most
kind
.
<EOS>
Upon
my
word
,
Jane
on
one
arm
,
and
me
on
the
other
!
 
<EOS>
Stop
,
stop
,
let
us
stand
a
little
back
,
Mrs.
Elton
is
going
;
dear
Mrs.
Elton
,
how
elegant
she
looks
!
 
<EOS>
Beautiful
lace
!
 
<EOS>
Now
we
all
follow
in
her
train
.
<EOS>
Quite
the
queen
of
the
evening
!
 
<EOS>
Well
,
here
we
are
at
the
passage
.
<EOS>
Two
steps
,
Jane
,
take
care
of
the
two
steps
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
no
,
there
is
but
one
.
<EOS>
Well
,
I
was
persuaded
there
were
two
.
<EOS>
How
very
odd
!
<EOS>
I
was
convinced
there
were
two
,
and
there
is
but
one
.
<EOS>
I
never
saw
any
thing
equal
to
the
comfort
and
style
 
Candles
everywhere
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
telling
you
of
your
grandmama
,
Jane
,
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
little
disappointment
.
 
<EOS>
The
baked
apples
and
biscuits
,
excellent
in
their
way
,
you
know
;
but
there
was
a
delicate
fricassee
of
sweetbread
and
some
asparagus
brought
in
at
first
,
and
good
Mr.
Woodhouse
,
not
thinking
the
asparagus
quite
boiled
enough
,
sent
it
all
out
again
.
<EOS>
Now
there
is
nothing
grandmama
loves
better
than
sweetbread
and
asparagus
 
<EOS>
so
she
was
rather
disappointed
,
but
we
agreed
we
would
not
speak
of
it
to
any
body
,
for
fear
of
its
getting
round
to
dear
Miss
Woodhouse
,
who
would
be
so
very
much
concerned
!
 
<EOS>
Well
,
this
is
brilliant
!
<EOS>
I
am
all
amazement
!
<EOS>
could
not
have
supposed
any
thing
!
 
<EOS>
Such
elegance
and
profusion
!
 
<EOS>
I
have
seen
nothing
like
it
since
 
<EOS>
Well
,
where
shall
we
sit
?
<EOS>
where
shall
we
sit
?
<EOS>
Anywhere
,
so
that
Jane
is
not
in
a
draught
.
<EOS>
Where
_
I
_
sit
is
of
no
consequence
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
do
you
recommend
this
side
?
 
<EOS>
Well
,
I
am
sure
,
Mr.
Churchill
 
<EOS>
only
it
seems
too
good
 
<EOS>
but
just
as
you
please
.
<EOS>
What
you
direct
in
this
house
can
not
be
wrong
.
<EOS>
Dear
Jane
,
how
shall
we
ever
recollect
half
the
dishes
for
grandmama
?
<EOS>
Soup
too
!
<EOS>
Bless
me
!
<EOS>
I
should
not
be
helped
so
soon
,
but
it
smells
most
excellent
,
and
I
can
not
help
beginning
.

<EOS>
Emma
had
no
opportunity
of
speaking
to
Mr.
Knightley
till
after
supper
;
but
,
when
they
were
all
in
the
ballroom
again
,
her
eyes
invited
him
irresistibly
to
come
to
her
and
be
thanked
.
<EOS>
He
was
warm
in
his
reprobation
of
Mr.
Elton
's
conduct
;
it
had
been
unpardonable
rudeness
;
and
Mrs.
Elton
's
looks
also
received
the
due
share
of
censure
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
aimed
at
wounding
more
than
Harriet
,
"
said
he
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Emma
,
why
is
it
that
they
are
your
enemies
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
looked
with
smiling
penetration
;
and
,
on
receiving
no
answer
,
added
,
"
_
<EOS>
She
_
ought
not
to
be
angry
with
you
,
<EOS>
I
suspect
,
whatever
he
may
be
.
 
<EOS>
To
that
surmise
,
you
say
nothing
,
of
course
;
but
confess
,
Emma
,
that
you
did
want
him
to
marry
Harriet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
,
"
replied
Emma
,
"
and
they
can
not
forgive
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
shook
his
head
;
but
there
was
a
smile
of
indulgence
with
it
,
and
he
only
said
,
  
"
I
shall
not
scold
you
.
<EOS>
I
leave
you
to
your
own
reflections
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Can
you
trust
me
with
such
flatterers
?
 
<EOS>
Does
my
vain
spirit
ever
tell
me
I
am
wrong
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
your
vain
spirit
,
but
your
serious
spirit
.
 
<EOS>
If
one
leads
you
wrong
,
I
am
sure
the
other
tells
you
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
own
myself
to
have
been
completely
mistaken
in
Mr.
Elton
.
<EOS>
There
is
a
littleness
about
him
which
you
discovered
,
and
which
I
did
not
:
and
I
was
fully
convinced
of
his
being
in
love
with
Harriet
.
<EOS>
It
was
through
a
series
of
strange
blunders
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
,
in
return
for
your
acknowledging
so
much
,
I
will
do
you
the
justice
to
say
,
that
you
would
have
chosen
for
him
better
than
he
has
chosen
for
himself
.
 
<EOS>
Harriet
Smith
has
some
first
-
rate
qualities
,
which
Mrs.
Elton
is
totally
without
.
<EOS>
An
unpretending
,
single
-
minded
,
artless
girl
 
infinitely
to
be
preferred
by
any
man
of
sense
and
taste
to
such
a
woman
as
Mrs.
Elton
.
<EOS>
I
found
Harriet
more
conversable
than
I
expected
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
was
extremely
gratified
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
interrupted
by
the
bustle
of
Mr.
Weston
calling
on
every
body
to
begin
dancing
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
Miss
Woodhouse
,
Miss
Otway
,
Miss
Fairfax
,
what
are
you
all
doing
?
 
<EOS>
Come
Emma
,
set
your
companions
the
example
.
<EOS>
Every
body
is
lazy
!
<EOS>
Every
body
is
asleep
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
ready
,
"
said
Emma
,
"
whenever
I
am
wanted
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Whom
are
you
going
to
dance
with
?
"
asked
Mr.
Knightley
.
  
<EOS>
She
hesitated
a
moment
,
and
then
replied
,
"
With
you
,
if
you
will
ask
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
?
"
said
he
,
offering
his
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
I
will
.
<EOS>
You
have
shewn
that
you
can
dance
,
and
you
know
we
are
not
really
so
much
brother
and
sister
as
to
make
it
at
all
improper
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Brother
and
sister
!
<EOS>
no
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
    
<EOS>
This
little
explanation
with
Mr.
Knightley
gave
Emma
considerable
pleasure
.
<EOS>
It
was
one
of
the
agreeable
recollections
of
the
ball
,
which
she
walked
about
the
lawn
the
next
morning
to
enjoy
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
extremely
glad
that
they
had
come
to
<EOS>
so
good
an
understanding
respecting
the
Eltons
,
and
that
their
opinions
of
both
husband
and
wife
were
so
much
alike
;
and
his
praise
of
Harriet
,
his
concession
in
her
favour
,
was
peculiarly
gratifying
.
<EOS>
The
impertinence
of
the
Eltons
,
which
for
a
few
minutes
had
threatened
to
ruin
the
rest
of
her
evening
,
had
been
the
occasion
of
some
of
its
highest
satisfactions
;
and
she
looked
forward
to
another
happy
result
 
the
cure
of
Harriet
's
infatuation
.
 
<EOS>
From
Harriet
's
manner
of
speaking
of
the
circumstance
before
they
quitted
the
ballroom
,
she
had
strong
hopes
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
as
if
her
eyes
were
suddenly
opened
,
and
she
were
enabled
to
see
that
Mr.
Elton
was
not
the
superior
creature
she
had
believed
him
.
<EOS>
The
fever
was
over
,
and
Emma
could
harbour
little
fear
of
the
pulse
being
quickened
again
by
injurious
courtesy
.
<EOS>
She
depended
on
the
evil
feelings
of
the
Eltons
for
supplying
all
the
discipline
of
pointed
neglect
that
could
be
farther
requisite
.
 
<EOS>
Harriet
rational
,
<EOS>
Frank
Churchill
not
too
much
in
love
,
and
Mr.
Knightley
not
wanting
to
quarrel
with
her
,
how
very
happy
a
summer
must
be
before
her
!
  
<EOS>
She
was
not
to
see
Frank
Churchill
this
morning
.
<EOS>
He
had
told
her
that
he
could
not
allow
himself
the
pleasure
of
stopping
at
Hartfield
,
as
he
was
to
be
at
home
by
the
middle
of
the
day
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
regret
it
.
  
<EOS>
Having
arranged
all
these
matters
,
looked
them
through
,
and
put
them
all
to
rights
,
she
was
just
turning
to
the
house
with
spirits
freshened
up
for
the
demands
of
the
two
little
boys
,
as
well
as
of
their
grandpapa
,
when
the
great
iron
sweep
-
gate
opened
,
and
two
persons
entered
whom
she
had
never
less
expected
to
see
together
 
Frank
Churchill
,
with
Harriet
leaning
on
his
arm
 
<EOS>
actually
Harriet
!
 
<EOS>
A
moment
sufficed
to
convince
her
that
something
extraordinary
had
happened
.
<EOS>
Harriet
looked
white
and
frightened
,
and
he
was
trying
to
cheer
her
.
 
<EOS>
The
iron
gates
and
the
front
-
door
were
not
twenty
yards
asunder
;
 
they
were
all
three
soon
in
the
hall
,
and
Harriet
immediately
sinking
into
a
chair
fainted
away
.
  
<EOS>
A
young
lady
who
faints
,
must
be
recovered
;
questions
must
be
answered
,
and
surprizes
be
explained
.
<EOS>
Such
events
are
very
interesting
,
but
the
suspense
of
them
can
not
last
long
.
<EOS>
A
few
minutes
made
Emma
acquainted
with
the
whole
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Smith
,
and
Miss
Bickerton
,
another
parlour
boarder
at
Mrs.
Goddard
's
,
who
had
been
also
at
the
ball
,
had
walked
out
together
,
and
taken
a
road
,
the
Richmond
road
,
which
,
though
apparently
public
enough
for
safety
,
had
led
them
into
alarm
.
 
<EOS>
About
half
a
mile
beyond
Highbury
,
making
a
sudden
turn
,
and
deeply
shaded
by
elms
on
each
side
,
it
became
for
a
considerable
stretch
very
retired
;
and
when
the
young
ladies
had
advanced
some
way
into
it
,
they
had
suddenly
perceived
at
a
small
distance
before
them
,
on
a
broader
patch
of
greensward
by
the
side
,
a
party
of
gipsies
.
<EOS>
A
child
on
the
watch
,
came
towards
them
to
beg
;
and
Miss
Bickerton
,
excessively
frightened
,
gave
a
great
scream
,
and
calling
on
Harriet
to
follow
her
,
ran
up
a
steep
bank
,
cleared
a
slight
hedge
at
the
top
,
and
made
the
best
of
her
way
by
a
short
cut
back
to
Highbury
.
<EOS>
But
poor
Harriet
could
not
follow
.
<EOS>
She
had
suffered
very
much
from
cramp
after
dancing
,
and
her
first
attempt
to
mount
the
bank
brought
on
such
a
return
of
it
as
made
her
absolutely
powerless
 
and
in
this
state
,
and
exceedingly
terrified
,
she
had
been
obliged
to
remain
.
  
<EOS>
How
the
trampers
might
have
behaved
,
had
the
young
ladies
been
more
courageous
,
must
be
doubtful
;
but
such
an
invitation
for
attack
could
not
be
resisted
;
and
Harriet
was
soon
assailed
by
half
a
dozen
children
,
headed
by
a
stout
woman
and
a
great
boy
,
all
clamorous
,
and
impertinent
in
look
,
though
not
absolutely
in
word
.
 
<EOS>
More
and
more
frightened
,
she
immediately
promised
them
money
,
and
taking
out
her
purse
,
gave
them
a
shilling
,
and
begged
them
not
to
want
more
,
or
to
use
her
ill
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
then
able
to
walk
,
though
but
slowly
,
and
was
moving
away
 
but
her
terror
and
her
purse
were
too
tempting
,
and
she
was
followed
,
or
rather
surrounded
,
by
the
whole
gang
,
demanding
more
.
  
<EOS>
In
this
state
Frank
Churchill
had
found
her
,
she
trembling
and
conditioning
,
they
loud
and
insolent
.
<EOS>
By
a
most
fortunate
chance
his
leaving
Highbury
had
been
delayed
so
as
to
bring
him
to
her
assistance
at
this
critical
moment
.
<EOS>
The
pleasantness
of
the
morning
had
induced
him
to
walk
forward
,
and
leave
his
horses
to
meet
him
by
another
road
,
a
mile
or
two
beyond
Highbury
 
and
happening
to
have
borrowed
a
pair
of
scissors
the
night
before
of
Miss
Bates
,
and
to
have
forgotten
to
restore
them
,
he
had
been
obliged
to
stop
at
her
door
,
and
go
in
for
a
few
minutes
:
he
was
therefore
later
than
he
had
intended
;
and
being
on
foot
,
was
unseen
by
the
whole
party
till
almost
close
to
them
.
<EOS>
The
terror
which
the
woman
and
boy
had
been
creating
in
Harriet
was
then
their
own
portion
.
<EOS>
He
had
left
them
completely
frightened
;
and
Harriet
eagerly
clinging
to
him
,
and
hardly
able
to
speak
,
had
just
strength
enough
to
reach
Hartfield
,
before
her
spirits
were
quite
overcome
.
<EOS>
It
was
his
idea
to
bring
her
to
Hartfield
:
he
had
thought
of
no
other
place
.
  
<EOS>
This
was
the
amount
of
the
whole
story
,
 
of
his
communication
and
of
Harriet
<EOS>
's
as
soon
as
she
had
recovered
her
senses
and
speech
.
 
<EOS>
He
dared
not
stay
longer
than
to
see
her
well
;
these
several
delays
left
him
not
another
minute
to
lose
;
and
Emma
engaging
to
give
assurance
of
her
safety
to
Mrs.
Goddard
,
and
notice
of
there
being
such
a
set
of
people
in
the
neighbourhood
to
Mr.
Knightley
,
he
set
off
,
with
all
the
grateful
blessings
that
she
could
utter
for
her
friend
and
herself
.
  
<EOS>
Such
an
adventure
as
this
,
 
a
fine
young
man
and
a
lovely
young
woman
thrown
together
in
such
a
way
,
could
hardly
fail
of
suggesting
certain
ideas
to
the
coldest
heart
and
the
steadiest
brain
.
<EOS>
So
Emma
thought
,
at
least
.
<EOS>
Could
a
linguist
,
could
a
grammarian
,
could
even
a
mathematician
have
seen
what
she
did
,
have
witnessed
their
appearance
together
,
and
heard
their
history
of
it
,
without
feeling
that
circumstances
had
been
at
work
to
make
them
peculiarly
interesting
to
each
other
?
 
<EOS>
How
much
more
must
an
imaginist
,
like
herself
,
be
on
fire
with
speculation
and
foresight
!
 
<EOS>
especially
with
such
a
groundwork
of
anticipation
as
her
mind
had
already
made
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
very
extraordinary
thing
!
<EOS>
Nothing
of
the
sort
had
ever
occurred
before
to
any
young
ladies
in
the
place
,
within
her
memory
;
no
rencontre
,
no
alarm
of
the
kind
;
 
and
now
it
had
happened
to
the
very
person
,
and
at
the
very
hour
,
when
the
other
very
person
was
chancing
to
pass
by
to
rescue
her
!
 
<EOS>
It
certainly
was
very
extraordinary
!
 
<EOS>
And
knowing
,
as
she
did
,
the
favourable
state
of
mind
of
each
at
this
period
,
it
struck
her
the
more
.
<EOS>
He
was
wishing
to
get
the
better
of
his
attachment
to
herself
<EOS>
,
she
just
recovering
from
her
mania
for
Mr.
Elton
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
as
if
every
thing
united
to
promise
the
most
interesting
consequences
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
possible
that
the
occurrence
should
not
be
strongly
recommending
each
to
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
few
minutes
'
conversation
which
she
had
yet
had
with
him
,
while
Harriet
had
been
partially
insensible
,
he
had
spoken
of
her
terror
,
her
naivete
,
her
fervour
as
she
seized
and
clung
to
his
arm
,
with
a
sensibility
amused
and
delighted
;
and
just
at
last
,
after
Harriet
's
own
account
had
been
given
,
he
had
expressed
his
indignation
at
the
abominable
folly
of
Miss
Bickerton
in
the
warmest
terms
.
<EOS>
Every
thing
was
to
take
its
natural
course
,
however
,
neither
impelled
nor
assisted
.
<EOS>
She
would
not
stir
a
step
,
nor
drop
a
hint
.
<EOS>
No
,
she
had
had
enough
of
interference
.
<EOS>
There
could
be
no
harm
in
a
scheme
,
a
mere
passive
scheme
.
<EOS>
It
was
no
more
than
a
wish
.
<EOS>
Beyond
it
she
would
on
no
account
proceed
.
  
<EOS>
Emma
's
first
resolution
was
to
keep
her
father
from
the
knowledge
of
what
had
passed
,
 
aware
of
the
anxiety
and
alarm
it
would
occasion
:
but
she
soon
felt
that
concealment
must
be
impossible
.
<EOS>
Within
half
an
hour
it
was
known
all
over
Highbury
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
very
event
to
engage
those
who
talk
most
,
the
young
and
the
low
;
and
all
the
youth
and
servants
in
the
place
were
soon
in
the
happiness
of
frightful
news
.
<EOS>
The
last
night
's
ball
seemed
lost
in
the
gipsies
.
<EOS>
Poor
Mr.
Woodhouse
trembled
as
he
sat
,
and
,
as
Emma
had
foreseen
,
would
scarcely
be
satisfied
without
their
promising
never
to
go
beyond
the
shrubbery
again
.
<EOS>
It
was
some
comfort
to
him
that
many
inquiries
after
himself
and
Miss
Woodhouse
(
for
his
neighbours
knew
that
he
loved
to
be
inquired
after
)
,
as
well
as
Miss
Smith
,
were
coming
in
during
the
rest
of
the
day
;
and
he
had
the
pleasure
of
returning
for
answer
,
that
they
were
all
very
indifferent
 
<EOS>
which
,
though
not
exactly
true
,
for
she
was
perfectly
well
,
and
Harriet
not
much
otherwise
,
Emma
would
not
interfere
with
.
<EOS>
She
had
an
unhappy
state
of
health
in
general
for
the
child
of
such
a
man
,
for
she
hardly
knew
what
indisposition
was
;
and
if
he
did
not
invent
illnesses
for
her
,
she
could
make
no
figure
in
a
message
.
  
<EOS>
The
gipsies
did
not
wait
for
the
operations
of
justice
;
they
took
themselves
off
in
a
hurry
.
<EOS>
The
young
ladies
of
Highbury
might
have
walked
again
in
safety
before
their
panic
began
,
and
the
whole
history
dwindled
soon
into
a
matter
of
little
importance
but
to
Emma
and
her
nephews
:
 
in
her
imagination
<EOS>
it
maintained
its
ground
,
and
Henry
and
John
were
still
asking
every
day
for
the
story
of
Harriet
and
the
gipsies
,
and
still
tenaciously
setting
her
right
if
she
varied
in
the
slightest
particular
from
the
original
recital
.
    
<EOS>
A
very
few
days
had
passed
after
this
adventure
,
when
Harriet
came
one
morning
to
Emma
with
a
small
parcel
in
her
hand
,
and
after
sitting
down
and
hesitating
,
thus
began
:
  
"
<EOS>
Miss
Woodhouse
 
if
you
are
at
leisure
 
<EOS>
I
have
something
that
I
should
like
to
tell
you
 
a
sort
of
confession
to
make
 
<EOS>
and
then
,
you
know
,
it
will
be
over
.
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
was
a
good
deal
surprized
;
but
begged
her
to
speak
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
seriousness
in
Harriet
's
manner
which
prepared
her
,
quite
as
much
as
her
words
,
for
something
more
than
ordinary
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
my
duty
,
and
I
am
sure
it
is
my
wish
,
"
she
continued
,
"
to
have
no
reserves
with
you
on
this
subject
.
<EOS>
As
I
am
happily
quite
an
altered
creature
in
_
one
<EOS>
_
_
respect
<EOS>
_
,
it
is
very
fit
that
you
should
have
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
it
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
want
to
say
more
than
is
necessary
 
<EOS>
I
am
too
much
ashamed
of
having
given
way
as
I
have
done
,
and
I
dare
say
you
understand
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Emma
,
"
<EOS>
I
hope
I
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
I
could
so
long
a
time
be
fancying
myself
!
...
<EOS>
"
cried
Harriet
,
warmly
.
<EOS>
"
It
seems
like
madness
!
<EOS>
I
can
see
nothing
at
all
extraordinary
in
him
now
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
care
whether
I
meet
him
or
not
 
except
that
of
the
two
I
had
rather
not
see
him
 
<EOS>
and
indeed
I
would
go
any
distance
round
to
avoid
him
 
<EOS>
but
I
do
not
envy
his
wife
in
the
least
;
I
neither
admire
her
nor
envy
her
,
as
I
have
done
:
she
is
very
charming
,
I
dare
say
,
and
all
that
,
but
I
think
her
very
ill
-
tempered
and
disagreeable
 
<EOS>
I
shall
never
forget
her
look
the
other
night
!
 
<EOS>
However
,
I
assure
you
,
Miss
Woodhouse
,
I
wish
her
no
evil
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
let
them
be
ever
so
happy
together
,
it
will
not
give
me
another
moment
's
pang
:
and
to
convince
you
that
I
have
been
speaking
truth
,
I
am
now
going
to
destroy
 
what
I
ought
to
have
destroyed
long
ago
 
what
I
ought
never
to
have
kept
 
<EOS>
I
know
that
very
well
(
blushing
as
she
spoke
)
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
now
I
will
destroy
it
all
 
<EOS>
and
it
is
my
particular
wish
to
do
it
in
your
presence
,
that
you
may
see
how
rational
I
am
grown
.
<EOS>
Can
not
you
guess
what
this
parcel
holds
?
<EOS>
"
said
she
,
with
a
conscious
look
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
the
least
in
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
Did
he
ever
give
you
any
thing
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
 
I
can
not
call
them
gifts
;
but
they
are
things
that
I
have
valued
very
much
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
held
the
parcel
towards
her
,
and
Emma
read
the
words
_
Most
_
_
precious
_
<EOS>
_
treasures
_
on
the
top
.
<EOS>
Her
curiosity
was
greatly
excited
.
<EOS>
Harriet
unfolded
the
parcel
,
and
she
looked
on
with
impatience
.
<EOS>
Within
abundance
of
silver
paper
was
a
pretty
little
Tunbridge
-
ware
box
,
which
Harriet
opened
:
<EOS>
it
was
well
lined
with
the
softest
cotton
;
but
,
excepting
the
cotton
,
Emma
saw
only
a
small
piece
of
court
-
plaister
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
"
said
Harriet
,
"
you
_
must
_
recollect
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
indeed
I
do
not
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
!
<EOS>
I
should
not
have
thought
it
possible
<EOS>
you
could
forget
what
passed
in
this
very
room
about
court
-
plaister
,
one
of
the
very
last
times
we
ever
met
in
it
!
 
<EOS>
It
was
but
<EOS>
a
very
few
days
before
I
had
my
sore
throat
 
just
before
Mr.
and
Mrs.
John
Knightley
came
 
<EOS>
I
think
the
very
evening
.
 
<EOS>
Do
not
you
remember
his
cutting
his
finger
with
your
new
penknife
,
and
your
recommending
court
-
plaister
?
 
<EOS>
But
,
as
you
had
none
about
you
,
and
knew
I
had
,
you
desired
me
to
supply
him
;
and
so
I
took
mine
out
and
cut
him
a
piece
;
but
it
was
a
great
deal
too
large
,
and
he
cut
it
smaller
,
and
kept
playing
some
time
with
what
was
left
,
before
he
gave
it
back
to
me
.
<EOS>
And
so
then
,
in
my
nonsense
,
I
could
not
help
making
a
treasure
of
it
 
<EOS>
so
I
put
it
by
never
to
be
used
,
and
looked
at
it
now
<EOS>
and
then
as
a
great
treat
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dearest
Harriet
!
<EOS>
"
cried
Emma
,
putting
her
hand
before
her
face
,
and
jumping
up
,
"
you
make
me
more
ashamed
of
myself
than
I
can
bear
.
<EOS>
Remember
it
?
<EOS>
Aye
,
I
remember
it
all
now
;
all
,
except
your
saving
this
relic
 
<EOS>
I
knew
nothing
of
that
till
this
moment
 
<EOS>
but
the
cutting
the
finger
,
and
my
recommending
court
-
plaister
,
and
saying
I
had
none
about
me
!
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
my
sins
,
my
sins
!
 
<EOS>
And
I
had
plenty
<EOS>
all
the
while
in
my
pocket
!
 
<EOS>
One
of
my
senseless
tricks
!
 
<EOS>
I
deserve
to
be
under
a
continual
blush
all
the
rest
of
my
life
.
 
<EOS>
Well
 
(
sitting
down
again
)
 
go
on
 
<EOS>
what
else
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
had
you
really
some
at
hand
yourself
?
<EOS>
I
am
sure
I
never
suspected
it
,
you
did
it
so
naturally
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
so
you
actually
put
this
piece
of
court
-
plaister
by
for
his
sake
!
"
<EOS>
said
Emma
,
recovering
from
her
state
of
shame
and
feeling
divided
between
wonder
and
amusement
.
<EOS>
And
secretly
she
added
to
herself
,
"
Lord
bless
me
!
<EOS>
when
should
I
ever
have
thought
of
putting
by
in
cotton
a
piece
of
court
-
plaister
that
Frank
Churchill
had
been
pulling
about
!
<EOS>
I
never
was
equal
to
this
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Here
,
"
resumed
Harriet
,
turning
to
her
box
again
,
"
here
is
something
still
more
valuable
,
I
mean
that
_
has
_
_
been
_
more
valuable
,
because
this
is
what
did
really
once
belong
to
him
,
which
the
court
-
plaister
never
did
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
was
quite
eager
to
see
this
superior
treasure
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
end
of
an
old
pencil
,
 
the
part
without
any
lead
.
  
<EOS>
"
This
was
really
his
,
"
said
Harriet
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
not
you
remember
one
morning
?
 
<EOS>
no
,
I
dare
say
you
do
not
.
<EOS>
But
one
morning
 
I
forget
exactly
the
day
 
<EOS>
but
perhaps
it
was
the
Tuesday
or
Wednesday
before
_
that
_
_
evening
_
,
he
wanted
to
make
a
memorandum
in
his
pocket
-
book
;
it
was
about
spruce
-
beer
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Knightley
had
been
telling
him
something
about
brewing
spruce
-
beer
,
and
he
wanted
to
put
it
down
;
but
when
he
took
out
his
pencil
,
there
was
so
little
lead
that
he
soon
cut
it
all
away
,
and
it
would
not
do
,
so
you
lent
him
another
,
and
this
was
left
upon
the
table
as
good
for
nothing
.
<EOS>
But
I
kept
my
eye
on
it
;
and
,
as
soon
as
I
dared
,
caught
it
up
,
and
never
parted
with
it
again
from
that
moment
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
remember
it
,
"
cried
Emma
;
"
I
perfectly
remember
it
.
 
<EOS>
Talking
about
spruce
-
beer
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
yes
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Knightley
and
I
both
saying
we
liked
it
,
and
Mr.
Elton
's
seeming
resolved
to
learn
to
like
it
too
.
<EOS>
I
perfectly
remember
it
.
 
<EOS>
Stop
;
Mr.
Knightley
was
standing
just
here
,
was
not
he
?
<EOS>
I
have
an
idea
he
was
standing
just
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
recollect
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
very
odd
,
but
I
can
not
recollect
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Elton
was
sitting
here
,
I
remember
,
much
about
where
I
am
now
.
<EOS>
"
    
<EOS>
"
Well
,
go
on
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
that
's
all
.
<EOS>
I
have
nothing
more
to
shew
you
,
or
to
say
 
except
that
I
am
now
going
to
throw
them
both
behind
the
fire
,
and
I
wish
you
to
see
me
do
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
poor
dear
Harriet
!
<EOS>
and
have
you
actually
found
happiness
in
treasuring
up
these
things
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
simpleton
as
I
was
!
 
<EOS>
but
I
am
quite
ashamed
of
it
now
,
and
wish
I
could
forget
as
easily
as
I
can
burn
them
.
<EOS>
It
was
very
wrong
of
me
,
you
know
,
to
keep
any
remembrances
,
after
he
was
married
.
<EOS>
I
knew
it
was
 
but
had
not
resolution
enough
to
part
with
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
Harriet
,
is
it
necessary
to
burn
the
court
-
plaister
?
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
a
word
to
say
for
the
bit
of
old
pencil
,
but
the
court
-
plaister
might
be
useful
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
happier
to
burn
it
,
"
replied
Harriet
.
<EOS>
"
It
has
a
disagreeable
look
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
must
get
rid
of
every
thing
.
 
<EOS>
There
it
goes
,
and
there
is
an
end
,
thank
Heaven
!
<EOS>
of
Mr.
Elton
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
when
,
"
thought
Emma
,
"
will
there
be
a
beginning
of
Mr.
Churchill
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
had
soon
afterwards
reason
to
believe
that
the
beginning
was
already
made
,
and
could
not
but
hope
that
the
gipsy
,
though
she
had
_
told
_
no
fortune
,
<EOS>
might
be
proved
to
have
made
Harriet
's
.
 
<EOS>
About
a
fortnight
after
the
alarm
,
they
came
to
a
sufficient
explanation
,
and
quite
undesignedly
.
<EOS>
Emma
was
not
thinking
of
it
at
the
moment
,
which
made
the
information
she
received
more
valuable
.
<EOS>
She
merely
said
,
in
the
course
of
some
trivial
chat
,
"
Well
,
Harriet
,
whenever
you
marry
I
would
advise
you
to
do
so
<EOS>
and
so
"
 
and
thought
no
more
of
it
,
till
after
a
minute
's
silence
she
heard
Harriet
say
in
a
very
serious
tone
,
"
I
shall
never
marry
.
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
then
looked
up
,
and
immediately
saw
how
it
was
;
and
after
a
moment
's
debate
,
as
to
whether
it
should
pass
unnoticed
or
not
,
replied
,
  
"
Never
marry
!
 
<EOS>
This
is
a
new
resolution
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
one
that
I
shall
never
change
,
however
.
"
  
<EOS>
After
another
short
hesitation
,
"
I
hope
it
does
not
proceed
from
 
<EOS>
I
hope
it
is
not
in
compliment
to
Mr.
Elton
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Mr.
Elton
indeed
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Harriet
indignantly
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
no
"
 
and
Emma
could
just
catch
the
words
,
"
so
superior
to
Mr.
Elton
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
then
took
a
longer
time
for
consideration
.
<EOS>
Should
she
proceed
no
farther
?
 
<EOS>
should
she
let
it
pass
,
and
seem
to
suspect
nothing
?
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
Harriet
might
think
her
cold
or
angry
if
she
did
;
or
perhaps
if
she
were
totally
silent
,
it
might
only
drive
Harriet
into
asking
her
to
hear
too
much
;
and
against
any
thing
like
such
an
unreserve
as
had
been
,
such
an
open
and
frequent
discussion
of
hopes
and
chances
,
she
was
perfectly
resolved
.
 
<EOS>
She
believed
it
would
be
wiser
for
her
to
say
and
know
at
once
,
all
that
she
meant
to
say
and
know
.
<EOS>
Plain
dealing
was
always
best
.
<EOS>
She
had
previously
determined
how
far
she
would
proceed
,
on
any
application
of
the
sort
;
and
it
would
be
safer
for
both
,
to
have
the
judicious
law
of
her
own
brain
laid
down
with
speed
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
decided
,
and
thus
spoke
    
<EOS>
"
Harriet
,
I
will
not
affect
to
be
in
doubt
of
your
meaning
.
<EOS>
Your
resolution
,
or
rather
your
expectation
of
never
marrying
,
results
from
an
idea
that
the
person
whom
you
might
prefer
,
would
be
too
greatly
your
superior
in
situation
to
think
of
you
.
<EOS>
Is
not
it
so
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Oh
!
<EOS>
Miss
Woodhouse
,
believe
me
<EOS>
I
have
not
the
presumption
to
suppose
  
<EOS>
Indeed
I
am
not
so
mad
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
is
a
pleasure
to
me
to
admire
him
at
a
distance
 
and
to
think
of
his
infinite
superiority
to
all
the
rest
of
the
world
,
with
the
gratitude
,
wonder
,
and
veneration
,
which
are
so
proper
,
in
me
especially
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
at
all
surprized
at
you
,
Harriet
.
<EOS>
The
service
he
rendered
you
was
enough
to
warm
your
heart
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Service
!
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
it
was
such
an
inexpressible
obligation
!
 
<EOS>
The
very
recollection
of
it
,
and
all
that
I
felt
at
the
time
 
when
I
saw
him
coming
 
<EOS>
his
noble
look
 
and
my
wretchedness
before
.
<EOS>
Such
a
change
!
<EOS>
In
one
moment
such
a
change
!
<EOS>
From
perfect
misery
to
perfect
happiness
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
very
natural
.
<EOS>
It
is
natural
,
and
it
is
honourable
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
honourable
,
I
think
,
to
chuse
so
well
and
so
gratefully
.
 
<EOS>
But
that
it
will
be
a
fortunate
preference
<EOS>
is
more
than
I
can
promise
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
advise
you
to
give
way
to
it
,
Harriet
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
by
any
means
engage
for
its
being
returned
.
<EOS>
Consider
what
you
are
about
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
it
will
be
wisest
in
you
to
check
your
feelings
while
you
can
:
at
any
rate
do
not
let
them
carry
you
far
,
unless
you
are
persuaded
of
his
liking
you
.
<EOS>
Be
observant
of
him
.
<EOS>
Let
his
behaviour
be
the
guide
of
your
sensations
.
<EOS>
I
give
you
this
caution
now
,
because
I
shall
never
speak
to
you
again
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
I
am
determined
against
all
interference
.
<EOS>
Henceforward
I
know
nothing
of
the
matter
.
<EOS>
Let
no
name
ever
pass
our
lips
.
<EOS>
We
were
very
wrong
before
;
we
will
be
cautious
now
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
your
superior
,
no
doubt
,
and
there
do
seem
objections
and
obstacles
of
a
very
serious
nature
;
but
<EOS>
yet
,
Harriet
,
more
wonderful
things
have
taken
place
,
there
have
been
matches
of
greater
disparity
.
<EOS>
But
take
care
of
yourself
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
have
you
too
sanguine
;
though
,
however
it
may
end
,
be
assured
your
raising
your
thoughts
to
_
him
_
,
is
a
mark
of
good
taste
which
I
shall
always
know
how
to
value
.
"
  
<EOS>
Harriet
kissed
her
hand
in
silent
and
submissive
gratitude
.
<EOS>
Emma
was
very
decided
in
thinking
such
an
attachment
no
bad
thing
for
her
friend
.
<EOS>
Its
tendency
would
be
to
raise
and
refine
her
mind
 
<EOS>
and
it
must
be
saving
her
from
the
danger
of
degradation
.
    
<EOS>
In
this
state
of
schemes
,
and
hopes
,
and
connivance
,
June
opened
upon
Hartfield
.
<EOS>
To
Highbury
in
general
it
brought
no
material
change
.
<EOS>
The
Eltons
were
still
talking
of
a
visit
from
the
Sucklings
,
and
of
the
use
to
be
made
of
their
barouche
-
landau
;
and
Jane
Fairfax
was
still
at
her
grandmother
's
;
and
as
the
return
of
the
Campbells
from
Ireland
was
again
delayed
,
and
August
,
instead
of
Midsummer
,
fixed
for
it
,
she
was
likely
to
remain
there
full
two
months
longer
,
provided
at
least
she
were
able
to
defeat
Mrs.
Elton
's
activity
in
her
service
,
and
save
herself
from
being
hurried
into
a
delightful
situation
against
her
will
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Knightley
,
who
,
for
some
reason
best
known
to
himself
,
had
certainly
taken
an
early
dislike
to
Frank
Churchill
,
was
only
growing
to
dislike
him
more
.
<EOS>
He
began
to
suspect
him
of
some
double
dealing
in
his
pursuit
of
Emma
.
<EOS>
That
Emma
was
his
object
appeared
indisputable
.
<EOS>
Every
thing
declared
it
;
his
own
attentions
,
his
father
's
hints
,
his
mother
-
in
-
law
's
guarded
silence
;
it
was
all
in
unison
;
words
,
conduct
,
discretion
,
and
indiscretion
,
told
the
same
story
.
<EOS>
But
while
so
many
were
devoting
him
to
Emma
,
and
Emma
herself
making
him
over
to
Harriet
,
Mr.
Knightley
began
to
suspect
him
of
some
inclination
to
trifle
with
Jane
Fairfax
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
understand
it
;
but
there
were
symptoms
of
intelligence
between
them
 
<EOS>
he
thought
so
at
least
 
symptoms
of
admiration
on
his
side
,
which
,
having
once
observed
,
he
could
not
persuade
himself
to
think
entirely
void
of
meaning
,
however
he
might
wish
to
escape
any
of
Emma
's
errors
of
imagination
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
She
_
was
not
present
when
the
suspicion
first
arose
.
<EOS>
He
was
dining
with
the
Randalls
family
,
and
Jane
,
at
the
Eltons
'
;
and
he
had
seen
a
look
,
more
than
a
single
look
,
at
Miss
Fairfax
,
which
,
from
the
admirer
of
Miss
Woodhouse
,
seemed
somewhat
out
of
place
.
<EOS>
When
he
was
again
in
their
company
,
he
could
not
help
remembering
what
he
had
seen
;
nor
could
he
avoid
observations
which
,
unless
it
were
like
Cowper
and
his
fire
at
twilight
,
  
"
Myself
creating
what
I
saw
,
"
  
brought
him
yet
stronger
suspicion
of
there
being
a
something
of
private
liking
,
of
private
understanding
even
,
between
Frank
Churchill
and
Jane
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
walked
up
one
day
after
dinner
,
as
he
very
often
did
,
to
spend
his
evening
at
Hartfield
.
<EOS>
Emma
and
Harriet
were
going
to
walk
;
he
joined
them
;
and
,
on
returning
,
they
fell
in
with
a
larger
party
,
who
,
like
themselves
,
judged
it
wisest
to
take
their
exercise
early
,
as
the
weather
threatened
rain
;
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Weston
and
their
son
,
Miss
Bates
and
her
niece
,
who
had
accidentally
met
.
<EOS>
They
all
united
;
and
,
on
reaching
Hartfield
gates
,
Emma
,
who
knew
it
was
exactly
the
sort
of
visiting
that
would
be
welcome
to
her
father
,
pressed
them
all
to
go
in
and
drink
tea
with
him
.
<EOS>
The
Randalls
party
agreed
to
it
immediately
;
and
after
a
pretty
long
speech
from
Miss
Bates
,
which
few
persons
listened
to
,
she
also
found
it
possible
to
accept
dear
Miss
Woodhouse
's
most
obliging
invitation
.
  
<EOS>
As
they
were
turning
into
the
grounds
,
Mr.
Perry
passed
by
on
horseback
.
<EOS>
The
gentlemen
spoke
of
his
horse
.
  
<EOS>
"
By
the
bye
,
"
said
Frank
Churchill
to
Mrs.
Weston
presently
,
"
what
became
of
Mr.
Perry
's
plan
of
setting
up
his
carriage
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Weston
looked
surprized
,
and
said
,
"
I
did
not
know
that
he
ever
had
any
such
plan
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nay
,
I
had
it
from
you
.
<EOS>
You
wrote
me
word
of
it
three
months
ago
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Me
!
impossible
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
you
did
.
<EOS>
I
remember
it
perfectly
.
<EOS>
You
mentioned
it
as
what
was
certainly
to
be
very
soon
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Perry
had
told
somebody
,
and
was
extremely
happy
about
it
.
<EOS>
It
was
owing
to
_
her
_
persuasion
,
as
she
thought
his
being
out
in
bad
weather
did
him
a
great
deal
of
harm
.
<EOS>
You
must
remember
it
now
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
word
I
never
heard
of
it
till
this
moment
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Never
!
<EOS>
really
,
never
!
 
<EOS>
Bless
me
!
<EOS>
how
could
it
be
?
 
<EOS>
Then
I
must
have
dreamt
it
 
<EOS>
but
I
was
completely
persuaded
 
Miss
Smith
<EOS>
,
you
walk
as
if
you
were
tired
.
<EOS>
You
will
not
be
sorry
to
find
yourself
at
home
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
this
?
 
<EOS>
What
is
this
?
"
cried
Mr.
Weston
,
"
about
Perry
and
a
carriage
?
<EOS>
Is
Perry
going
to
set
up
his
carriage
,
Frank
?
<EOS>
I
am
glad
he
can
afford
it
.
<EOS>
You
had
it
from
himself
,
had
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
,
"
replied
his
son
,
laughing
,
"
I
seem
to
have
had
it
from
nobody
.
 
<EOS>
Very
odd
!
 
<EOS>
I
really
was
persuaded
of
Mrs.
Weston
's
having
mentioned
it
in
one
of
her
letters
to
Enscombe
,
many
weeks
ago
,
with
all
these
particulars
 
<EOS>
but
as
she
declares
she
never
heard
a
syllable
of
it
before
,
of
course
it
must
have
been
a
dream
.
<EOS>
I
am
a
great
dreamer
.
<EOS>
I
dream
of
every
body
at
Highbury
when
I
am
away
 
and
when
I
have
gone
through
my
particular
friends
,
then
I
begin
dreaming
of
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Perry
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
odd
though
,
"
observed
his
father
,
"
that
you
should
have
had
such
a
regular
connected
dream
about
people
whom
it
was
not
very
likely
you
should
be
thinking
of
at
Enscombe
.
<EOS>
Perry
's
setting
up
his
carriage
!
<EOS>
and
his
wife
's
persuading
him
to
it
,
out
of
care
for
his
health
 
<EOS>
just
what
will
happen
,
I
have
no
doubt
,
some
time
or
other
;
only
a
little
premature
.
<EOS>
What
an
air
of
probability
sometimes
runs
through
a
dream
!
<EOS>
And
at
others
,
what
a
heap
of
absurdities
it
is
!
<EOS>
Well
,
Frank
,
your
dream
certainly
shews
that
Highbury
is
in
your
thoughts
when
you
are
absent
.
<EOS>
Emma
,
you
are
a
great
dreamer
,
I
think
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
was
out
of
hearing
.
<EOS>
She
had
hurried
on
before
her
guests
to
prepare
her
father
for
their
appearance
,
and
was
beyond
the
reach
of
Mr.
Weston
's
hint
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
to
own
the
truth
,
"
cried
Miss
Bates
,
who
had
been
trying
in
vain
to
be
heard
the
last
two
minutes
,
"
if
I
must
speak
on
this
subject
,
there
is
no
denying
that
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
might
have
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
mean
to
say
that
he
did
not
dream
it
 
<EOS>
I
am
sure
I
have
sometimes
the
oddest
dreams
in
the
world
 
<EOS>
but
if
I
am
questioned
about
it
,
I
must
acknowledge
that
there
was
such
an
idea
last
spring
;
for
Mrs.
Perry
herself
mentioned
it
to
my
mother
,
and
the
Coles
knew
of
it
as
well
as
ourselves
 
<EOS>
but
it
was
quite
a
secret
,
known
to
nobody
else
,
and
only
thought
of
about
three
days
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Perry
was
very
anxious
that
he
should
have
a
carriage
,
and
came
to
my
mother
in
great
spirits
one
morning
because
she
thought
she
had
prevailed
.
<EOS>
Jane
,
do
n't
you
remember
grandmama
's
telling
us
of
it
when
we
got
home
?
<EOS>
I
forget
where
we
had
been
walking
to
 
very
likely
to
Randalls
;
<EOS>
yes
,
I
think
it
was
to
Randalls
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Perry
was
always
particularly
fond
of
my
mother
 
<EOS>
indeed
I
do
not
know
who
is
not
 
<EOS>
and
she
had
mentioned
it
to
her
in
confidence
;
she
had
no
objection
to
her
telling
us
,
of
course
,
but
it
was
not
to
go
beyond
:
and
,
from
that
day
to
this
,
I
never
mentioned
it
to
a
soul
that
I
know
of
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
,
I
will
not
positively
answer
for
my
having
never
dropt
a
hint
,
because
I
know
I
do
sometimes
pop
out
a
thing
before
I
am
aware
.
<EOS>
I
am
a
talker
,
you
know
;
I
am
rather
a
talker
;
and
now
<EOS>
and
then
I
have
let
a
thing
escape
me
which
I
should
not
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
like
Jane
;
I
wish
I
were
.
<EOS>
I
will
answer
for
it
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
she
_
never
betrayed
the
least
thing
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
Where
is
she
?
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
just
behind
.
<EOS>
Perfectly
remember
Mrs.
Perry
's
coming
.
 
<EOS>
Extraordinary
dream
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
They
were
entering
the
hall
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Knightley
's
eyes
had
preceded
Miss
Bates
's
in
a
glance
at
Jane
.
<EOS>
From
Frank
Churchill
's
face
,
where
he
thought
he
saw
confusion
suppressed
or
laughed
away
,
he
had
involuntarily
turned
to
hers
;
but
she
was
indeed
behind
,
and
too
busy
with
her
shawl
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Weston
had
walked
in
.
<EOS>
The
two
other
gentlemen
waited
at
the
door
to
let
her
pass
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Knightley
suspected
in
Frank
Churchill
the
determination
of
catching
her
eye
 
he
seemed
watching
her
intently
 
in
vain
,
however
,
if
it
were
so
 
Jane
passed
between
them
into
the
hall
,
and
looked
at
neither
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
no
time
for
farther
remark
or
explanation
.
<EOS>
The
dream
must
be
borne
with
,
and
Mr.
Knightley
must
take
his
seat
with
the
rest
<EOS>
round
the
large
modern
circular
table
which
Emma
had
introduced
at
Hartfield
,
and
which
none
but
Emma
could
have
had
power
to
place
there
and
persuade
her
father
to
use
,
instead
of
the
small
-
sized
Pembroke
,
on
which
two
of
his
daily
meals
had
<EOS>
,
for
forty
years
been
crowded
.
<EOS>
Tea
passed
pleasantly
,
and
nobody
seemed
in
a
hurry
to
move
.
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Woodhouse
,
"
said
Frank
Churchill
,
after
examining
a
table
behind
him
,
which
he
could
reach
as
he
sat
,
"
have
your
nephews
taken
away
their
alphabets
 
their
box
of
letters
?
<EOS>
It
used
to
stand
here
.
<EOS>
Where
is
it
?
<EOS>
This
is
a
sort
of
dull
-
looking
evening
,
that
ought
to
be
treated
rather
as
winter
than
summer
.
<EOS>
We
had
great
amusement
with
those
letters
one
morning
.
<EOS>
I
want
to
puzzle
you
again
.
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
was
pleased
with
the
thought
;
and
producing
the
box
,
the
table
was
quickly
scattered
over
with
alphabets
,
which
no
one
seemed
so
much
disposed
to
employ
as
their
two
selves
.
<EOS>
They
were
rapidly
forming
words
for
each
other
,
or
for
any
body
else
who
would
be
puzzled
.
<EOS>
The
quietness
of
the
game
made
it
particularly
eligible
for
Mr.
Woodhouse
,
who
had
often
been
distressed
by
the
more
animated
sort
,
which
Mr.
Weston
had
occasionally
introduced
,
and
who
now
sat
happily
occupied
in
lamenting
,
with
tender
melancholy
,
over
the
departure
of
the
"
poor
little
boys
,
"
or
in
fondly
pointing
out
,
as
he
took
up
any
stray
letter
near
him
,
how
beautifully
Emma
had
written
it
.
  
<EOS>
Frank
Churchill
placed
a
word
before
Miss
Fairfax
.
<EOS>
She
gave
a
slight
glance
round
the
table
,
and
applied
herself
to
it
.
<EOS>
Frank
was
next
to
Emma
,
Jane
opposite
to
them
 
and
Mr.
Knightley
so
placed
as
to
see
them
all
;
and
it
was
his
object
to
see
as
much
as
he
could
,
with
as
little
apparent
observation
.
<EOS>
The
word
was
discovered
,
and
with
a
faint
smile
pushed
away
.
<EOS>
If
meant
to
be
immediately
mixed
with
the
others
,
and
buried
from
sight
,
she
should
have
looked
on
the
table
instead
of
looking
just
across
,
for
it
was
not
mixed
;
and
Harriet
,
eager
after
every
fresh
word
,
and
finding
out
none
,
directly
took
it
up
,
and
fell
to
work
.
<EOS>
She
was
sitting
by
Mr.
Knightley
,
and
turned
to
him
for
help
.
<EOS>
The
word
was
_
blunder
_
;
and
as
Harriet
exultingly
proclaimed
it
,
there
was
a
blush
on
Jane
's
cheek
which
gave
it
a
meaning
not
otherwise
ostensible
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Knightley
connected
it
with
the
dream
;
but
how
it
could
all
be
,
was
beyond
his
comprehension
.
<EOS>
How
the
delicacy
,
the
discretion
of
his
favourite
could
have
been
so
lain
asleep
!
<EOS>
He
feared
there
must
be
some
decided
involvement
.
<EOS>
Disingenuousness
and
double
dealing
seemed
to
meet
him
at
every
turn
.
<EOS>
These
letters
were
but
the
vehicle
for
gallantry
and
trick
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
child
's
play
,
chosen
to
conceal
a
deeper
game
on
Frank
Churchill
's
part
.
  
<EOS>
With
great
indignation
did
he
continue
to
observe
him
;
with
great
alarm
and
distrust
,
to
observe
also
his
two
blinded
companions
.
<EOS>
He
saw
a
short
word
prepared
for
Emma
,
and
given
to
her
with
a
look
sly
and
demure
.
<EOS>
He
saw
that
Emma
had
soon
made
it
out
,
and
found
it
highly
entertaining
,
though
it
was
something
which
she
judged
it
proper
to
appear
to
censure
;
for
she
said
,
"
Nonsense
!
<EOS>
for
shame
!
"
<EOS>
He
heard
Frank
Churchill
next
say
,
with
a
glance
towards
Jane
,
"
I
will
give
it
to
her
 
<EOS>
shall
I
?
"
 
<EOS>
and
as
clearly
heard
Emma
opposing
it
with
eager
laughing
warmth
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
no
,
you
must
not
;
you
shall
not
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
done
however
.
<EOS>
This
gallant
young
man
,
who
seemed
to
love
without
feeling
,
and
to
recommend
himself
without
complaisance
,
directly
handed
over
the
word
to
Miss
Fairfax
,
and
with
a
particular
degree
of
sedate
civility
entreated
her
to
study
it
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Knightley
's
excessive
curiosity
to
know
what
this
word
might
be
,
made
him
seize
every
possible
moment
for
darting
his
eye
towards
it
,
and
it
was
not
long
before
he
saw
it
to
be
_
Dixon
<EOS>
_
.
<EOS>
Jane
Fairfax
's
perception
seemed
to
accompany
his
;
her
comprehension
was
certainly
more
equal
to
the
covert
meaning
,
the
superior
intelligence
,
of
those
five
letters
so
arranged
.
<EOS>
She
was
evidently
displeased
;
looked
up
,
and
seeing
herself
watched
,
blushed
more
deeply
than
he
had
ever
perceived
her
,
and
saying
only
,
"
I
did
not
know
that
proper
names
were
allowed
,
"
pushed
away
the
letters
with
even
an
angry
spirit
,
and
looked
resolved
to
be
engaged
by
no
other
word
that
could
be
offered
.
<EOS>
Her
face
was
averted
from
those
who
had
made
the
attack
,
and
turned
towards
her
aunt
.
  
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
very
true
,
my
dear
,
"
cried
the
latter
,
though
Jane
had
not
spoken
a
word
 
<EOS>
"
I
was
just
going
to
say
the
same
thing
.
<EOS>
It
is
time
for
us
to
be
going
indeed
.
<EOS>
The
evening
is
closing
in
,
and
grandmama
will
be
looking
for
us
.
<EOS>
My
dear
sir
,
you
are
too
obliging
.
<EOS>
We
really
must
wish
you
good
night
.
"
  
<EOS>
Jane
's
alertness
in
moving
,
proved
her
as
ready
as
her
aunt
had
preconceived
.
<EOS>
She
was
immediately
up
,
and
wanting
to
quit
the
table
;
but
so
many
were
also
moving
,
that
she
could
not
get
away
;
and
Mr.
Knightley
thought
he
saw
another
collection
of
letters
anxiously
pushed
towards
her
,
and
resolutely
swept
away
by
her
unexamined
.
<EOS>
She
was
afterwards
looking
for
her
shawl
 
<EOS>
Frank
Churchill
was
looking
also
 
it
was
growing
dusk
,
and
the
room
was
in
confusion
;
and
how
they
parted
,
Mr.
Knightley
could
not
tell
.
  
<EOS>
He
remained
at
Hartfield
after
all
the
rest
,
his
thoughts
full
of
what
he
had
seen
;
so
full
,
that
when
the
candles
came
to
assist
his
observations
,
he
must
 
<EOS>
yes
,
he
certainly
must
,
as
a
friend
 
an
anxious
friend
 
give
Emma
some
hint
,
ask
her
some
question
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
see
her
in
a
situation
of
such
danger
,
without
trying
to
preserve
her
.
<EOS>
It
was
his
duty
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pray
,
Emma
,
"
said
he
,
"
may
I
ask
in
what
lay
the
great
amusement
,
the
poignant
sting
of
the
last
word
given
to
you
and
Miss
Fairfax
?
<EOS>
I
saw
the
word
,
and
am
curious
to
know
how
it
could
be
so
very
entertaining
to
the
one
,
and
so
very
distressing
to
the
other
.
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
was
extremely
confused
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
endure
to
give
him
the
true
explanation
;
for
though
her
suspicions
were
by
no
means
removed
,
she
was
really
ashamed
of
having
ever
imparted
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
"
she
cried
in
evident
embarrassment
,
"
it
all
meant
nothing
;
a
mere
joke
among
ourselves
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
joke
,
"
he
replied
gravely
,
"
seemed
confined
to
you
and
Mr.
Churchill
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
had
hoped
she
would
speak
again
,
but
she
did
not
.
<EOS>
She
would
rather
busy
herself
about
any
thing
than
speak
.
<EOS>
He
sat
a
little
while
in
doubt
.
<EOS>
A
variety
of
evils
crossed
his
mind
.
<EOS>
Interference
 
fruitless
interference
.
<EOS>
Emma
's
confusion
,
and
the
acknowledged
intimacy
,
seemed
to
declare
her
affection
engaged
.
<EOS>
Yet
he
would
speak
.
<EOS>
He
owed
it
to
her
,
to
risk
any
thing
that
might
be
involved
in
an
unwelcome
interference
,
rather
than
her
welfare
;
to
encounter
any
thing
,
rather
than
the
remembrance
of
neglect
in
such
a
cause
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Emma
,
"
said
he
at
last
,
with
earnest
kindness
,
"
<EOS>
do
you
think
you
perfectly
understand
the
degree
of
acquaintance
between
the
gentleman
and
lady
we
have
been
speaking
of
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Between
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
and
Miss
Fairfax
?
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
yes
,
perfectly
.
 
<EOS>
Why
do
you
make
a
doubt
of
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Have
you
never
at
any
time
had
reason
to
think
that
he
admired
her
,
or
that
she
admired
him
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Never
,
never
!
"
<EOS>
she
cried
with
a
most
open
eagerness
 
"
Never
,
for
the
twentieth
part
of
a
moment
,
did
such
an
idea
occur
to
me
.
<EOS>
And
how
could
it
possibly
come
into
your
head
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
lately
imagined
that
I
saw
symptoms
of
attachment
between
them
 
certain
expressive
looks
,
which
I
did
not
believe
meant
to
be
public
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
you
amuse
me
excessively
.
<EOS>
I
am
delighted
to
find
that
you
can
vouchsafe
to
let
your
imagination
wander
 
<EOS>
but
it
will
not
do
 
very
sorry
to
check
you
in
your
first
essay
 
<EOS>
but
indeed
it
will
not
do
.
<EOS>
There
is
no
admiration
between
them
,
I
do
assure
you
;
and
the
appearances
which
have
caught
you
,
have
arisen
from
some
peculiar
circumstances
 
feelings
rather
of
a
totally
different
nature
 
<EOS>
it
is
impossible
exactly
to
explain
:
 
<EOS>
there
is
a
good
deal
of
nonsense
in
it
 
but
the
part
which
is
capable
of
being
communicated
,
which
is
sense
,
is
,
that
they
are
as
far
from
any
attachment
or
admiration
for
one
another
,
as
any
two
beings
in
the
world
can
be
.
<EOS>
That
is
,
I
_
presume
_
it
to
be
so
on
her
side
,
and
I
can
_
answer
_
for
its
being
so
on
his
.
<EOS>
I
will
answer
for
the
gentleman
's
indifference
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
spoke
with
a
confidence
which
staggered
,
with
a
satisfaction
which
silenced
,
Mr.
Knightley
.
<EOS>
She
was
in
gay
spirits
,
and
would
have
prolonged
the
conversation
,
wanting
to
hear
the
particulars
of
his
suspicions
,
every
look
described
,
and
all
the
where
s
and
how
s
of
a
circumstance
which
highly
entertained
her
:
but
his
gaiety
did
not
meet
hers
.
<EOS>
He
found
he
could
not
be
useful
,
and
his
feelings
were
too
much
irritated
for
talking
.
<EOS>
That
he
might
not
be
irritated
into
an
absolute
fever
,
by
the
fire
which
Mr.
Woodhouse
's
tender
habits
required
almost
every
evening
throughout
the
year
,
he
soon
afterwards
took
a
hasty
leave
,
and
walked
home
to
the
coolness
and
solitude
of
Donwell
Abbey
.
    
<EOS>
After
being
long
fed
with
hopes
of
a
speedy
visit
from
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Suckling
,
the
Highbury
world
were
obliged
to
endure
the
mortification
of
hearing
that
they
could
not
possibly
come
till
the
autumn
.
<EOS>
No
such
importation
of
novelties
could
enrich
their
intellectual
stores
at
present
.
<EOS>
In
the
daily
interchange
of
news
,
they
must
be
again
restricted
to
the
other
topics
with
which
for
a
while
the
Sucklings
'
coming
had
been
united
,
such
as
the
last
accounts
of
Mrs.
Churchill
,
whose
health
seemed
every
day
to
supply
a
different
report
,
and
the
situation
of
Mrs.
Weston
,
whose
happiness
it
was
to
be
hoped
might
eventually
be
as
much
increased
by
the
arrival
of
a
child
,
as
that
of
all
her
neighbours
was
by
the
approach
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Elton
was
very
much
disappointed
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
delay
of
a
great
deal
of
pleasure
and
parade
.
<EOS>
Her
introductions
and
recommendations
must
all
wait
,
and
every
projected
party
be
still
only
talked
of
.
<EOS>
So
she
thought
at
first
;
 
but
a
little
consideration
convinced
her
that
every
thing
need
not
be
put
off
.
<EOS>
Why
should
not
they
explore
to
Box
Hill
though
the
Sucklings
did
not
come
?
<EOS>
They
could
go
there
again
with
them
in
the
autumn
.
<EOS>
It
was
settled
that
they
should
go
to
Box
Hill
.
<EOS>
That
there
was
to
be
such
a
party
had
been
long
generally
known
:
it
had
even
given
the
idea
of
another
.
<EOS>
Emma
had
never
been
to
Box
Hill
;
she
wished
to
see
what
every
body
found
so
well
worth
seeing
,
and
she
and
Mr.
Weston
had
agreed
to
chuse
some
fine
morning
and
drive
thither
.
<EOS>
Two
or
three
more
of
the
chosen
only
were
to
be
admitted
to
join
them
,
and
it
was
to
be
done
in
a
quiet
,
unpretending
,
elegant
way
,
infinitely
superior
to
the
bustle
and
preparation
,
the
regular
eating
and
drinking
,
and
picnic
parade
of
the
Eltons
and
the
Sucklings
.
  
<EOS>
This
was
so
very
well
understood
between
them
,
that
Emma
could
not
but
feel
some
surprise
,
and
a
little
displeasure
,
on
hearing
from
Mr.
Weston
that
he
had
been
proposing
to
Mrs.
Elton
,
as
her
brother
and
sister
had
failed
her
,
that
the
two
parties
should
unite
,
and
go
together
;
and
that
as
Mrs.
Elton
had
very
readily
acceded
to
it
,
so
it
was
to
be
,
if
she
had
no
objection
.
<EOS>
Now
,
as
her
objection
was
nothing
but
her
very
great
dislike
of
Mrs.
Elton
,
of
which
Mr.
Weston
must
already
be
perfectly
aware
,
it
was
not
worth
bringing
forward
again
:
 
it
could
not
be
done
without
a
reproof
to
him
,
which
would
be
giving
pain
to
his
wife
;
and
she
found
herself
therefore
obliged
to
consent
to
an
arrangement
which
she
would
have
done
a
great
deal
to
avoid
;
an
arrangement
which
would
probably
expose
her
even
to
the
degradation
of
being
said
to
be
of
Mrs.
Elton
's
party
!
<EOS>
Every
feeling
was
offended
;
and
the
forbearance
of
her
outward
submission
left
a
heavy
arrear
due
of
secret
severity
in
her
reflections
on
the
unmanageable
goodwill
of
Mr.
Weston
's
temper
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
you
approve
of
what
I
have
done
,
"
said
he
very
comfortably
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
thought
you
would
.
<EOS>
Such
schemes
as
these
are
nothing
without
numbers
.
<EOS>
One
can
not
have
too
large
a
party
.
<EOS>
A
large
party
secures
its
own
amusement
.
<EOS>
And
she
is
a
good
-
natured
woman
after
all
.
<EOS>
One
could
not
leave
her
out
.
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
denied
none
of
it
aloud
,
and
agreed
to
none
of
it
in
private
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
now
the
middle
of
June
,
and
the
weather
fine
;
and
Mrs.
Elton
was
growing
impatient
to
name
the
day
,
and
settle
with
Mr.
Weston
as
to
pigeon
-
pies
and
cold
lamb
,
when
a
lame
carriage
-
horse
threw
every
thing
into
sad
uncertainty
.
<EOS>
It
might
be
weeks
,
it
might
be
only
a
few
days
,
before
the
horse
were
useable
;
but
no
preparations
could
be
ventured
on
,
and
it
was
all
melancholy
stagnation
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Elton
's
resources
were
inadequate
to
such
an
attack
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
not
this
most
vexatious
,
Knightley
?
"
<EOS>
she
cried
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
such
weather
for
exploring
!
 
<EOS>
These
delays
and
disappointments
are
quite
odious
.
<EOS>
What
are
we
to
do
?
 
<EOS>
The
year
will
wear
away
at
this
rate
,
and
nothing
done
.
<EOS>
Before
this
time
last
year
I
assure
you
we
had
had
a
delightful
exploring
party
from
Maple
Grove
to
Kings
Weston
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
had
better
explore
to
Donwell
,
"
replied
Mr.
Knightley
.
<EOS>
"
That
may
be
done
without
horses
.
<EOS>
Come
,
and
eat
my
strawberries
.
<EOS>
They
are
ripening
fast
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
If
Mr.
Knightley
did
not
begin
seriously
,
he
was
obliged
to
proceed
so
,
for
his
proposal
was
caught
at
with
delight
;
and
the
"
Oh
!
I
should
like
it
of
all
things
,
"
was
not
plainer
in
words
than
manner
.
<EOS>
Donwell
was
famous
for
its
strawberry
-
beds
,
which
seemed
a
plea
for
the
invitation
:
but
no
plea
was
necessary
;
cabbage
-
beds
would
have
been
enough
to
tempt
the
lady
,
who
only
wanted
to
be
going
somewhere
.
<EOS>
She
promised
him
again
and
again
to
come
 
much
oftener
than
he
doubted
 
and
was
extremely
gratified
by
such
a
proof
of
intimacy
,
such
a
distinguishing
compliment
as
she
chose
to
consider
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
may
depend
upon
me
,
"
said
she
.
<EOS>
"
I
certainly
will
come
.
<EOS>
Name
your
day
,
and
I
will
come
.
<EOS>
You
will
allow
me
to
bring
Jane
Fairfax
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
name
a
day
,
"
said
he
,
"
till
I
have
spoken
to
some
others
whom
I
would
wish
to
meet
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
leave
all
that
to
me
.
<EOS>
Only
give
me
a
carte
-
blanche
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
Lady
Patroness
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
It
is
my
party
.
<EOS>
I
will
bring
friends
with
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
will
bring
Elton
,
"
said
he
:
"
<EOS>
but
I
will
not
trouble
you
to
give
any
other
invitations
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
now
you
are
looking
very
sly
.
<EOS>
But
consider
 
you
need
not
be
afraid
of
delegating
power
to
_
me
<EOS>
_
.
<EOS>
I
am
no
young
lady
on
her
preferment
.
<EOS>
Married
women
,
you
know
,
may
be
safely
authorised
.
<EOS>
It
is
my
party
.
<EOS>
Leave
it
all
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
will
invite
your
guests
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
 
he
calmly
replied
,
 
"
<EOS>
there
is
but
one
married
woman
in
the
world
whom
I
can
ever
allow
to
invite
what
guests
she
pleases
to
Donwell
,
and
that
one
is
 
"
  
"
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Weston
,
I
suppose
,
"
interrupted
Mrs.
Elton
,
rather
mortified
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
 
Mrs.
Knightley
;
 
and
till
she
is
in
being
,
I
will
manage
such
matters
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
you
are
an
odd
creature
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
cried
,
satisfied
to
have
no
one
preferred
to
herself
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
a
humourist
,
and
may
say
what
you
like
.
<EOS>
Quite
a
humourist
.
<EOS>
Well
,
I
shall
bring
Jane
with
me
 
Jane
and
her
aunt
.
 
<EOS>
The
rest
I
leave
to
you
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
objections
at
all
to
meeting
the
Hartfield
family
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
scruple
.
<EOS>
I
know
you
are
attached
to
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
certainly
will
meet
them
if
I
can
prevail
;
and
I
shall
call
on
Miss
Bates
in
my
way
home
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
quite
unnecessary
;
I
see
Jane
every
day
:
 
<EOS>
but
as
you
like
.
<EOS>
It
is
to
be
a
morning
scheme
,
you
know
,
Knightley
;
quite
a
simple
thing
.
<EOS>
I
shall
wear
a
large
bonnet
,
and
bring
one
of
my
little
baskets
hanging
on
my
arm
.
<EOS>
Here
,
 
probably
this
basket
with
pink
ribbon
.
<EOS>
Nothing
can
be
more
simple
,
you
see
.
<EOS>
And
Jane
will
have
such
another
.
<EOS>
There
is
to
be
no
form
or
parade
 
a
sort
of
gipsy
party
.
<EOS>
We
are
to
walk
about
your
gardens
,
and
gather
the
strawberries
ourselves
,
and
sit
under
trees
;
 
and
whatever
else
you
may
like
to
provide
,
it
is
to
be
all
out
of
doors
 
a
table
spread
in
the
shade
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
Every
thing
as
natural
and
simple
as
possible
.
<EOS>
Is
not
that
your
idea
?
"
  
"
Not
quite
.
<EOS>
My
idea
of
the
simple
and
the
natural
will
be
to
have
the
table
spread
in
the
dining
-
room
.
<EOS>
The
nature
and
the
simplicity
of
gentlemen
and
ladies
,
with
their
servants
and
furniture
<EOS>
,
I
think
is
best
observed
by
meals
within
doors
.
<EOS>
When
you
are
tired
of
eating
strawberries
in
the
garden
,
there
shall
be
cold
meat
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Well
 
as
you
please
;
only
do
n't
have
a
great
set
out
.
<EOS>
And
,
by
the
bye
,
can
I
or
my
housekeeper
be
of
any
use
to
you
with
our
opinion
?
 
<EOS>
Pray
be
sincere
,
Knightley
.
<EOS>
If
you
wish
me
to
talk
to
Mrs.
Hodges
,
or
to
inspect
anything
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
have
not
the
least
wish
for
it
,
I
thank
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
 
<EOS>
but
if
any
difficulties
should
arise
,
my
housekeeper
is
extremely
clever
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
answer
for
it
,
that
mine
thinks
herself
full
as
clever
,
and
would
spurn
any
body
's
assistance
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
we
had
a
donkey
.
<EOS>
The
thing
would
be
for
us
all
to
come
on
donkeys
,
Jane
,
Miss
Bates
,
and
me
 
and
my
caro
sposo
walking
by
.
<EOS>
I
really
must
talk
to
him
about
purchasing
a
donkey
.
<EOS>
In
a
country
life
I
conceive
it
to
be
a
sort
of
necessary
;
for
,
let
a
woman
have
ever
so
many
resources
,
it
is
not
possible
for
her
to
be
always
shut
up
at
home
;
 
and
very
long
walks
,
you
know
 
in
summer
<EOS>
there
is
dust
,
and
in
winter
there
is
dirt
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
You
will
not
find
either
,
between
Donwell
and
Highbury
.
<EOS>
Donwell
Lane
is
never
dusty
,
and
now
it
is
perfectly
dry
.
<EOS>
Come
on
a
donkey
,
however
,
if
you
prefer
it
.
<EOS>
You
can
borrow
Mrs.
Cole
's
.
<EOS>
I
would
wish
every
thing
to
be
as
much
to
your
taste
as
possible
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
I
am
sure
you
would
.
<EOS>
Indeed
I
do
you
justice
,
my
good
friend
.
<EOS>
Under
that
peculiar
sort
of
dry
,
blunt
manner
,
I
know
you
have
the
warmest
heart
.
<EOS>
As
I
tell
Mr.
E.
,
you
are
a
thorough
humourist
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
believe
me
,
Knightley
,
I
am
fully
sensible
of
your
attention
to
me
in
the
whole
of
this
scheme
.
<EOS>
You
have
hit
upon
the
very
thing
to
please
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Knightley
had
another
reason
for
avoiding
a
table
in
the
shade
.
<EOS>
He
wished
to
persuade
Mr.
Woodhouse
,
as
well
as
Emma
,
to
join
the
party
;
and
he
knew
that
to
have
any
of
them
sitting
down
out
of
doors
to
eat
would
inevitably
make
him
ill
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Woodhouse
must
not
,
under
the
specious
pretence
of
a
morning
drive
,
and
an
hour
or
two
spent
at
Donwell
,
be
tempted
away
to
his
misery
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
invited
on
good
faith
.
<EOS>
No
lurking
horrors
were
to
upbraid
him
for
his
easy
credulity
.
<EOS>
He
did
consent
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
been
at
Donwell
for
two
years
.
<EOS>
"
Some
very
fine
morning
,
he
,
and
Emma
,
and
Harriet
,
could
go
very
well
;
and
he
could
sit
still
with
Mrs.
Weston
,
while
the
dear
girls
walked
about
the
gardens
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
suppose
they
could
be
damp
now
,
in
the
middle
of
the
day
.
<EOS>
He
should
like
to
see
the
old
house
again
exceedingly
,
and
should
be
very
happy
to
meet
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Elton
,
and
any
other
of
his
neighbours
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
not
see
any
objection
at
all
to
his
,
and
Emma
's
,
and
Harriet
's
going
there
some
very
fine
morning
.
<EOS>
He
thought
it
very
well
done
of
Mr.
Knightley
to
invite
them
 
very
kind
and
sensible
 
much
cleverer
than
dining
out
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
not
fond
of
dining
out
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Knightley
was
fortunate
in
every
body
's
most
ready
concurrence
.
<EOS>
The
invitation
was
everywhere
so
well
received
,
that
it
seemed
as
if
,
like
Mrs.
Elton
,
they
were
all
taking
the
scheme
as
a
particular
compliment
to
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
Emma
and
Harriet
professed
very
high
expectations
of
pleasure
from
it
;
and
Mr.
Weston
,
unasked
,
promised
to
get
Frank
over
to
join
them
,
if
possible
;
a
proof
of
approbation
and
gratitude
which
could
have
been
dispensed
with
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Knightley
was
then
obliged
to
say
that
he
should
be
glad
to
see
him
;
and
Mr.
Weston
engaged
to
lose
no
time
in
writing
,
and
spare
no
arguments
to
induce
him
to
come
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
meanwhile
the
lame
horse
recovered
so
fast
,
that
the
party
to
Box
Hill
was
again
under
happy
consideration
;
and
at
last
Donwell
was
settled
for
one
day
,
and
Box
Hill
for
the
next
,
 
the
weather
appearing
exactly
right
.
  
<EOS>
Under
a
bright
mid
-
day
sun
,
at
almost
Midsummer
,
Mr.
Woodhouse
was
safely
conveyed
in
his
carriage
,
with
one
window
down
,
to
partake
of
this
al
-
fresco
party
;
and
in
one
of
the
most
comfortable
rooms
in
the
Abbey
,
especially
prepared
for
him
by
a
fire
all
the
morning
,
he
was
happily
placed
,
quite
at
his
ease
,
ready
to
talk
with
pleasure
of
what
had
been
achieved
,
and
advise
every
body
to
come
and
sit
down
,
and
not
to
heat
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Weston
,
who
seemed
to
have
walked
there
on
purpose
to
be
tired
,
and
sit
all
the
time
with
him
,
remained
,
when
all
the
others
were
invited
or
persuaded
out
,
his
patient
listener
and
sympathiser
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
so
long
since
Emma
had
been
at
the
Abbey
,
that
as
soon
as
she
was
satisfied
of
her
father
's
comfort
,
she
was
glad
to
leave
him
,
and
look
around
her
;
eager
to
refresh
and
correct
her
memory
with
more
particular
observation
,
more
exact
understanding
of
a
house
and
grounds
which
must
ever
be
so
interesting
to
her
and
all
her
family
.
  
<EOS>
She
felt
all
the
honest
pride
and
complacency
which
her
alliance
with
the
present
and
future
proprietor
could
fairly
warrant
,
as
she
viewed
the
respectable
size
and
style
of
the
building
,
its
suitable
,
becoming
,
characteristic
situation
,
low
and
sheltered
 
its
ample
gardens
stretching
down
to
meadows
washed
by
a
stream
,
of
which
the
Abbey
,
with
all
the
old
neglect
of
prospect
,
had
scarcely
a
sight
 
and
its
abundance
of
timber
in
rows
and
avenues
,
which
neither
fashion
nor
extravagance
had
rooted
up
.
 
<EOS>
The
house
was
larger
than
Hartfield
,
and
totally
unlike
it
,
covering
a
good
deal
of
ground
,
rambling
and
irregular
,
with
many
comfortable
,
and
one
or
two
handsome
rooms
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
just
what
it
ought
to
be
,
and
it
looked
what
it
was
 
<EOS>
and
Emma
felt
an
increasing
respect
for
it
,
as
the
residence
of
a
family
of
such
true
gentility
,
untainted
in
blood
and
understanding
.
 
<EOS>
Some
faults
of
temper
John
Knightley
had
;
but
Isabella
had
connected
herself
unexceptionably
.
<EOS>
She
had
given
them
neither
men
,
nor
names
,
nor
places
<EOS>
,
that
could
raise
a
blush
.
<EOS>
These
were
pleasant
feelings
,
and
she
walked
about
and
indulged
them
till
it
was
necessary
to
do
as
the
others
did
,
and
collect
round
the
strawberry
-
beds
.
 
<EOS>
The
whole
party
were
assembled
,
excepting
Frank
Churchill
,
who
was
expected
every
moment
from
Richmond
;
and
Mrs.
Elton
,
in
all
her
apparatus
of
happiness
,
her
large
bonnet
and
her
basket
,
was
very
ready
to
lead
the
way
in
gathering
,
accepting
,
or
talking
 
strawberries
,
and
only
strawberries
,
could
now
be
thought
or
spoken
of
.

<EOS>
Such
,
for
half
an
hour
,
was
the
conversation
 
interrupted
only
once
by
Mrs.
Weston
,
who
came
out
,
in
her
solicitude
after
her
son
-
in
-
law
,
to
inquire
if
he
were
come
 
and
<EOS>
she
was
a
little
uneasy
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
some
fears
of
his
horse
.
  
<EOS>
Seats
tolerably
in
the
shade
were
found
;
and
now
Emma
was
obliged
to
overhear
what
Mrs.
Elton
and
Jane
Fairfax
were
talking
of
.
 
<EOS>
A
situation
,
a
most
desirable
situation
,
was
in
question
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Elton
had
received
notice
of
it
that
morning
,
and
was
in
raptures
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
with
Mrs.
Suckling
,
it
was
not
with
Mrs.
Bragge
,
but
in
felicity
and
splendour
it
fell
short
only
of
them
:
it
was
with
a
cousin
of
Mrs.
Bragge
,
an
acquaintance
of
Mrs.
Suckling
,
a
lady
known
at
Maple
Grove
.
<EOS>
Delightful
,
charming
,
superior
,
first
circles
,
spheres
,
lines
,
ranks
,
every
thing
 
and
Mrs.
Elton
was
wild
to
have
the
offer
closed
with
immediately
.
 
<EOS>
On
her
side
,
all
was
warmth
,
energy
,
and
triumph
 
<EOS>
and
she
positively
refused
to
take
her
friend
's
negative
,
though
Miss
Fairfax
continued
to
assure
her
that
she
would
not
at
present
engage
in
any
thing
,
repeating
the
same
motives
which
she
had
been
heard
to
urge
before
.
 
<EOS>
Still
Mrs.
Elton
insisted
on
being
authorised
to
write
an
acquiescence
by
the
morrow
's
post
.
 
<EOS>
How
Jane
could
bear
it
at
all
,
was
astonishing
to
Emma
.
 
<EOS>
She
did
look
vexed
,
she
did
speak
pointedly
 
and
at
last
,
with
a
decision
of
action
unusual
to
her
,
proposed
a
removal
.
 
<EOS>
"
Should
not
they
walk
?
<EOS>
Would
not
Mr.
Knightley
shew
them
<EOS>
the
gardens
 
<EOS>
all
the
gardens
?
 
<EOS>
She
wished
to
see
the
whole
extent
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
pertinacity
of
her
friend
seemed
more
than
she
could
bear
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
hot
;
and
after
walking
some
time
over
the
gardens
in
a
scattered
,
dispersed
way
,
scarcely
any
three
together
,
they
insensibly
followed
one
another
to
the
delicious
shade
of
a
broad
short
avenue
of
limes
,
which
stretching
beyond
the
garden
at
an
equal
distance
from
the
river
,
seemed
the
finish
of
the
pleasure
grounds
.
 
<EOS>
It
led
to
nothing
;
nothing
but
a
view
at
the
end
over
a
low
stone
wall
with
high
pillars
,
which
seemed
intended
,
in
their
erection
,
to
give
the
appearance
of
an
approach
to
the
house
,
which
never
had
been
there
.
<EOS>
Disputable
,
however
,
as
might
be
the
taste
of
such
a
termination
,
it
was
in
itself
a
charming
walk
,
and
the
view
which
closed
it
extremely
pretty
.
 
<EOS>
The
considerable
slope
,
at
nearly
the
foot
of
which
the
Abbey
stood
,
gradually
acquired
a
steeper
form
beyond
its
grounds
;
and
at
half
a
mile
distant
was
a
bank
of
considerable
abruptness
and
grandeur
,
well
clothed
with
wood
;
 
and
at
the
bottom
of
this
bank
,
favourably
placed
and
sheltered
,
rose
the
Abbey
Mill
Farm
,
with
meadows
in
front
,
and
the
river
making
a
close
and
handsome
curve
around
it
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
sweet
view
 
sweet
to
the
eye
and
the
mind
.
<EOS>
English
verdure
,
English
culture
,
English
comfort
,
seen
under
a
sun
bright
,
without
being
oppressive
.
  
<EOS>
In
this
walk
Emma
and
Mr.
Weston
found
all
the
others
assembled
;
and
towards
this
view
she
immediately
perceived
Mr.
Knightley
and
Harriet
distinct
from
the
rest
,
quietly
leading
the
way
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Knightley
and
Harriet
!
 
<EOS>
It
was
an
odd
tete
-
a
-
tete
;
but
she
was
glad
to
see
it
.
 
<EOS>
There
had
been
a
time
when
he
would
have
scorned
her
as
a
companion
,
and
turned
from
her
with
little
ceremony
.
<EOS>
Now
they
seemed
in
pleasant
conversation
.
<EOS>
There
had
been
a
time
also
when
Emma
would
have
been
sorry
to
see
Harriet
in
a
spot
so
favourable
for
the
Abbey
Mill
Farm
;
but
now
she
feared
it
not
.
<EOS>
It
might
be
safely
viewed
with
all
its
appendages
of
prosperity
and
beauty
,
its
rich
pastures
,
spreading
flocks
,
orchard
in
blossom
,
and
light
column
of
smoke
ascending
.
 
<EOS>
She
joined
them
at
the
wall
,
and
found
them
more
engaged
in
talking
than
in
looking
around
.
<EOS>
He
was
giving
Harriet
information
as
to
modes
of
agriculture
,
etc
.
<EOS>
and
Emma
received
a
smile
which
seemed
to
say
,
"
These
are
my
own
concerns
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
right
to
talk
on
such
subjects
,
without
being
suspected
of
introducing
Robert
Martin
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
She
did
not
suspect
him
.
<EOS>
It
was
too
old
a
story
.
 
<EOS>
Robert
Martin
had
probably
ceased
to
think
of
Harriet
.
 
<EOS>
They
took
a
few
turns
together
along
the
walk
.
 
<EOS>
The
shade
was
most
refreshing
,
and
Emma
found
it
the
pleasantest
part
of
the
day
.
  
<EOS>
The
next
remove
was
to
the
house
;
they
must
all
go
in
and
eat
;
 
and
they
were
all
seated
and
busy
,
and
still
Frank
Churchill
did
not
come
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Weston
looked
,
and
looked
in
vain
.
<EOS>
His
father
would
not
own
himself
uneasy
,
and
laughed
at
her
fears
;
but
she
could
not
be
cured
of
wishing
that
he
would
part
with
his
black
mare
.
<EOS>
He
had
expressed
himself
as
to
coming
,
with
more
than
common
certainty
.
"
<EOS>
His
aunt
was
so
much
better
,
that
he
had
not
a
doubt
of
getting
over
to
them
.
"
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Churchill
's
state
,
however
,
as
many
were
ready
to
remind
her
,
was
liable
to
such
sudden
variation
as
might
disappoint
her
nephew
in
the
most
reasonable
dependence
 
and
Mrs.
Weston
was
at
last
persuaded
to
believe
,
or
to
say
,
that
it
must
be
by
some
attack
of
Mrs.
Churchill
that
he
was
prevented
coming
.
 
<EOS>
Emma
looked
at
Harriet
while
the
point
was
under
consideration
;
she
behaved
very
well
,
and
betrayed
no
emotion
.
  
<EOS>
The
cold
repast
was
over
,
and
the
party
were
to
go
out
once
more
to
see
what
had
not
yet
been
seen
,
the
old
Abbey
fish
-
ponds
;
perhaps
get
as
far
as
the
clover
,
which
was
to
be
begun
cutting
on
the
morrow
,
or
,
at
any
rate
,
have
the
pleasure
of
being
hot
,
and
growing
cool
again
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Woodhouse
,
who
had
already
taken
his
little
round
in
the
highest
part
of
the
gardens
,
where
no
damps
from
the
river
were
imagined
even
by
him
,
stirred
no
more
;
and
his
daughter
resolved
to
remain
with
him
,
that
Mrs.
Weston
might
be
persuaded
away
by
her
husband
to
the
exercise
and
variety
which
her
spirits
seemed
to
need
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Knightley
had
done
all
in
his
power
for
Mr.
Woodhouse
's
entertainment
.
<EOS>
Books
of
engravings
,
drawers
of
medals
,
cameos
,
corals
,
shells
,
and
every
other
family
collection
within
his
cabinets
,
had
been
prepared
for
his
old
friend
,
to
while
away
the
morning
;
and
the
kindness
had
perfectly
answered
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Woodhouse
had
been
exceedingly
well
amused
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Weston
had
been
shewing
them
all
to
him
,
and
now
he
would
shew
them
all
to
Emma
;
 
fortunate
in
having
no
other
resemblance
to
a
child
,
than
in
a
total
want
of
taste
for
what
he
saw
,
for
he
was
slow
,
constant
,
and
methodical
.
 
<EOS>
Before
this
second
looking
over
was
begun
,
however
,
Emma
walked
into
the
hall
for
the
sake
of
a
few
moments
'
free
observation
of
the
entrance
and
ground
-
plot
of
the
house
 
and
was
hardly
there
,
when
Jane
Fairfax
appeared
,
coming
quickly
in
from
the
garden
,
and
with
a
look
of
escape
.
 
<EOS>
Little
expecting
to
meet
Miss
Woodhouse
so
soon
,
there
was
a
start
at
first
;
but
Miss
Woodhouse
was
the
very
person
she
was
in
quest
of
.
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
be
so
kind
,
"
said
she
,
"
when
I
am
missed
,
as
to
say
that
I
am
gone
home
?
 
<EOS>
I
am
going
this
moment
.
 
<EOS>
My
aunt
is
not
aware
how
late
it
is
,
nor
how
long
we
have
been
absent
 
<EOS>
but
I
am
sure
we
shall
be
wanted
,
and
I
am
determined
to
go
directly
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
said
nothing
about
it
to
any
body
.
<EOS>
It
would
only
be
giving
trouble
and
distress
.
<EOS>
Some
are
gone
to
the
ponds
,
and
some
to
the
lime
walk
.
<EOS>
Till
they
all
come
in
I
shall
not
be
missed
;
and
when
they
do
,
will
you
have
the
goodness
to
say
that
I
am
gone
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Certainly
,
if
you
wish
it
;
 
but
you
are
not
going
to
walk
to
Highbury
alone
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
 
what
should
hurt
me
?
 
<EOS>
I
walk
fast
.
<EOS>
I
shall
be
at
home
in
twenty
minutes
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
it
is
too
far
,
indeed
it
is
,
to
be
walking
quite
alone
.
<EOS>
Let
my
father
's
servant
go
with
you
.
 
<EOS>
Let
me
order
the
carriage
.
<EOS>
It
can
be
round
in
five
minutes
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
thank
you
 
but
on
no
account
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
rather
walk
.
 
<EOS>
And
for
_
me
_
to
be
afraid
of
walking
alone
!
 
<EOS>
I
,
who
may
so
soon
have
to
guard
others
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
spoke
with
great
agitation
;
and
Emma
very
feelingly
replied
,
"
That
can
be
no
reason
for
your
being
exposed
to
danger
now
.
<EOS>
I
must
order
the
carriage
.
<EOS>
The
heat
even
would
be
danger
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
fatigued
already
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
,
"
 
<EOS>
she
answered
 
"
I
am
fatigued
;
but
it
is
not
the
sort
of
fatigue
 
quick
walking
will
refresh
me
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Woodhouse
,
we
all
know
at
times
what
it
is
to
be
wearied
in
spirits
.
<EOS>
Mine
,
I
confess
,
are
exhausted
.
<EOS>
The
greatest
kindness
you
can
shew
me
,
will
be
to
let
me
have
my
own
way
,
and
only
say
that
I
am
gone
when
it
is
necessary
.
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
had
not
another
word
to
oppose
.
<EOS>
She
saw
it
all
;
and
entering
into
her
feelings
,
promoted
her
quitting
the
house
immediately
,
and
watched
her
safely
off
with
the
zeal
of
a
friend
.
<EOS>
Her
parting
look
was
grateful
 
and
her
parting
words
,
"
Oh
!
<EOS>
Miss
Woodhouse
,
the
comfort
of
being
sometimes
alone
!
"
 
seemed
to
burst
from
an
overcharged
heart
,
and
to
describe
somewhat
of
the
continual
endurance
to
be
practised
by
her
,
even
towards
some
of
those
who
loved
her
best
.
  
<EOS>
"
Such
a
home
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
such
an
aunt
!
<EOS>
"
said
Emma
,
as
she
turned
back
into
the
hall
again
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
pity
you
.
<EOS>
And
the
more
sensibility
you
betray
of
their
just
horrors
,
the
more
I
shall
like
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Jane
had
not
been
gone
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
and
they
had
only
accomplished
some
views
of
St.
Mark
's
Place
,
Venice
,
when
Frank
Churchill
entered
the
room
.
<EOS>
Emma
had
not
been
thinking
of
him
<EOS>
,
she
had
forgotten
to
think
of
him
 
<EOS>
but
she
was
very
glad
to
see
him
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Weston
would
be
at
ease
.
<EOS>
The
black
mare
was
blameless
;
_
they
_
were
right
who
had
named
Mrs.
Churchill
as
the
cause
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
detained
by
a
temporary
increase
of
illness
in
her
;
a
nervous
seizure
,
which
had
lasted
some
hours
 
<EOS>
and
he
had
quite
given
up
every
thought
of
coming
,
till
very
late
;
 
and
had
he
known
how
hot
a
ride
he
should
have
,
and
how
late
,
with
all
his
hurry
,
he
must
be
<EOS>
,
he
believed
he
should
not
have
come
at
all
.
<EOS>
The
heat
was
excessive
;
he
had
never
suffered
any
thing
like
<EOS>
it
 
almost
wished
he
had
staid
at
home
 
<EOS>
nothing
killed
him
like
heat
 
<EOS>
he
could
bear
any
degree
of
cold
,
etc
.
,
but
heat
was
intolerable
 
and
he
sat
down
,
at
the
greatest
possible
distance
from
the
slight
remains
of
Mr.
Woodhouse
's
fire
,
looking
very
deplorable
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
soon
be
cooler
,
if
you
sit
still
,
"
said
Emma
.
  
<EOS>
"
As
soon
as
I
am
cooler
I
shall
go
back
again
.
<EOS>
I
could
very
ill
be
spared
 
but
such
a
point
had
been
made
of
my
coming
!
<EOS>
You
will
all
be
going
soon
I
suppose
;
the
whole
party
breaking
up
.
<EOS>
I
met
_
<EOS>
one
_
as
I
came
 
<EOS>
Madness
in
such
weather
!
 
<EOS>
absolute
madness
!
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
listened
,
and
looked
,
and
soon
perceived
that
Frank
Churchill
's
state
might
be
best
defined
by
the
expressive
phrase
of
being
out
of
humour
.
<EOS>
Some
people
were
always
cross
when
they
were
hot
.
<EOS>
Such
might
be
his
constitution
;
and
as
she
knew
that
eating
and
drinking
were
often
the
cure
of
such
incidental
complaints
,
she
recommended
his
taking
some
refreshment
;
he
would
find
abundance
of
every
thing
in
the
dining
-
room
 
<EOS>
and
she
humanely
pointed
out
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
 
he
should
not
eat
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
hungry
;
it
would
only
make
him
hotter
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
In
two
minutes
,
however
,
he
relented
in
his
own
favour
;
and
muttering
something
about
spruce
-
beer
,
walked
off
.
<EOS>
Emma
returned
all
her
attention
to
her
father
,
saying
in
secret
    
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
I
have
done
being
in
love
with
him
.
<EOS>
I
should
not
like
a
man
who
is
so
soon
discomposed
by
a
hot
morning
.
<EOS>
Harriet
's
sweet
easy
temper
will
not
mind
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
was
gone
long
enough
to
have
had
a
very
comfortable
meal
,
and
came
back
<EOS>
all
the
better
 
grown
quite
cool
 
and
,
with
good
manners
,
like
himself
 
able
to
draw
a
chair
close
to
them
<EOS>
,
take
an
interest
in
their
employment
;
and
regret
,
in
a
reasonable
way
,
that
he
should
be
so
late
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
in
his
best
spirits
,
but
seemed
trying
to
improve
them
;
and
,
at
last
,
made
himself
talk
nonsense
very
agreeably
.
<EOS>
They
were
looking
over
views
in
Swisserland
.
  
<EOS>
"
As
soon
as
my
aunt
gets
well
,
I
shall
go
abroad
,
"
said
he
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
never
be
easy
till
I
have
seen
some
of
these
places
.
<EOS>
You
will
have
my
sketches
,
some
time
or
other
,
to
look
at
 
or
my
tour
to
read
 
or
my
poem
.
<EOS>
I
shall
do
something
to
expose
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
may
be
 
but
not
by
sketches
in
Swisserland
.
<EOS>
You
will
never
go
to
Swisserland
.
<EOS>
Your
uncle
and
aunt
will
never
allow
you
to
leave
England
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
They
may
be
induced
to
go
too
.
<EOS>
A
warm
climate
may
be
prescribed
for
her
.
<EOS>
I
have
more
than
half
an
expectation
of
our
all
going
abroad
.
<EOS>
I
assure
you
I
have
.
<EOS>
I
feel
a
strong
persuasion
,
this
morning
,
that
I
shall

be
abroad

<EOS>
I
ought
to
travel
.
<EOS>
I
am
tired
of
doing
nothing
.
<EOS>
I
want
a
change
.
<EOS>
I
am
serious
,
Miss
Woodhouse
,
<EOS>
whatever
your
penetrating
eyes
may
fancy
 
<EOS>
I
am
sick
of
England
 
and
would
leave
it
to
-
morrow
,
if
I
could
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
sick
of
prosperity
and
indulgence
.
<EOS>
Can
not
you
invent
a
few
hardships
for
yourself
,
and
be
contented
to
stay
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
I
_
sick
of
prosperity
and
indulgence
!
<EOS>
You
are
quite
mistaken
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
look
upon
myself
as
either
prosperous
or
indulged
.
<EOS>
I
am
thwarted
in
every
thing
material
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
consider
myself
at
all
a
fortunate
person
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
not
quite
so
miserable
,
though
,
as
when
you
first
came
.
<EOS>
Go
and
eat
and
drink
a
little
more
,
and
you
will
do
very
well
.
<EOS>
Another
slice
of
cold
meat
,
another
draught
of
Madeira
and
water
,
will
make
you
nearly
on
a
par
with
the
rest
of
us
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
 
I
shall
not
stir
.
<EOS>
I
shall
sit
by
you

<EOS>
You
are
my
best
cure

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
are
going
to
Box
Hill
to
-
morrow
;
 
you
will
join
us
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
Swisserland
,
but
it
will
be
something
for
a
young
man
so
much
in
want
of
a
change
.
<EOS>
You
will
stay
,
and
go
with
us
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
certainly
not
;
I
shall
go
home
in
the
cool
of
the
evening
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
may
come
again
in
the
cool
of
to
-
morrow
morning
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
 
It
will
not
be
worth
while
.
<EOS>
If
I
come
,
I
shall
be
cross
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Then
pray
stay
at
Richmond
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
if
I
do
,
I
shall
be
crosser
still
.
<EOS>
I
can
never
bear
to
think
of
you
all
there
without
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
These
are
difficulties
which
you
must
settle
for
yourself
.
<EOS>
Chuse
your
own
degree
of
crossness
.
<EOS>
I
shall
press
you
no
more
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
rest
of
the
party
were
now
returning
,
and
all
were
soon
collected
.
<EOS>
With
some
there
was
great
joy
at
the
sight
of
Frank
Churchill
;
others
took
it
very
composedly
;
but
there
was
a
very
general
distress
and
disturbance
on
Miss
Fairfax
's
disappearance
being
explained
.
<EOS>
That
it
was
time
for
every
body
to
go
,
concluded
the
subject
;
and
with
a
short
final
arrangement
for
the
next
day
's
scheme
,
they
parted
.
<EOS>
Frank
Churchill
's
little
inclination
to
exclude
himself
increased
so
much
,
that
his
last
words
to
Emma
were
,
  
"
<EOS>
Well
;
 
if
_
you
_
wish
me
to
stay
and
join
the
party
,
I
will
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
smiled
her
acceptance
;
and
nothing
less
than
a
summons
from
Richmond
was
to
take
him
back
before
the
following
evening
.
    
<EOS>
They
had
a
very
fine
day
for
Box
Hill
;
and
all
the
other
outward
circumstances
of
arrangement
,
accommodation
,
and
punctuality
,
were
in
favour
of
a
pleasant
party
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Weston
directed
the
whole
,
officiating
safely
between
Hartfield
and
the
Vicarage
,
and
every
body
was
in
good
time
.
<EOS>
Emma
and
Harriet
went
together
;
Miss
Bates
and
her
niece
,
with
the
Eltons
;
the
gentlemen
on
horseback
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Weston
remained
with
Mr.
Woodhouse
.
<EOS>
Nothing
was
wanting
but
to
be
happy
when
they
got
there
.
<EOS>
Seven
miles
were
travelled
in
expectation
of
enjoyment
,
and
every
body
had
a
burst
of
admiration
on
first
arriving
;
but
in
the
general
amount
of
the
day
there
was
deficiency
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
languor
,
a
want
of
spirits
,
a
want
of
union
,
which
could
not
be
got
over
.
<EOS>
They
separated
too
much
into
parties
.
<EOS>
The
Eltons
walked
together
;
Mr.
Knightley
took
charge
of
Miss
Bates
and
Jane
;
and
Emma
and
Harriet
belonged
to
Frank
Churchill
.
<EOS>
And
Mr.
Weston
tried
,
in
vain
,
to
make
them
harmonise
better
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
at
first
an
accidental
division
,
but
it
never
materially
varied
.
<EOS>
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Elton
,
indeed
,
shewed
no
unwillingness
to
mix
,
and
be
as
agreeable
as
they
could
;
but
during
the
two
whole
hours
that
were
spent
on
the
hill
,
there
seemed
a
principle
of
separation
,
between
the
other
parties
,
too
strong
for
any
fine
prospects
,
or
any
cold
collation
,
or
any
cheerful
Mr.
Weston
,
to
remove
.
  
<EOS>
At
first
it
was
downright
dulness
to
Emma
.
<EOS>
She
had
never
seen
Frank
Churchill
so
silent
and
stupid
.
<EOS>
He
said
nothing
worth
hearing
 
looked
without
seeing
 
admired
without
intelligence
 
listened
without
knowing
what
she
said
.
<EOS>
While
he
was
so
dull
,
it
was
no
wonder
that
Harriet
should
be
dull
likewise
;
and
they
were
both
insufferable
.
  
<EOS>
When
they
all
sat
down
it
was
better
;
to
her
taste
a
great
deal
better
,
for
Frank
Churchill
<EOS>
grew
talkative
and
gay
,
making
her
his
first
object
.
<EOS>
Every
distinguishing
attention
that
could
be
paid
,
was
paid
to
her
.
<EOS>
To
amuse
her
,
and
be
agreeable
in
her
eyes
,
seemed
all
that
he
cared
for
 
and
Emma
,
glad
to
be
enlivened
,
not
sorry
to
be
flattered
,
was
gay
and
easy
too
,
and
gave
him
all
the
friendly
encouragement
,
the
admission
to
be
gallant
,
which
she
had
ever
given
in
the
first
and
most
animating
period
of
their
acquaintance
;
but
which
now
,
in
her
own
estimation
,
meant
nothing
,
though
in
the
judgment
of
most
people
looking
on
it
must
have
had
such
an
appearance
as
no
English
word
but
flirtation
could
very
well
describe
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
and
Miss
Woodhouse
flirted
together
excessively
.
<EOS>
"
They
were
laying
themselves
open
to
that
very
phrase
 
and
to
having
it
sent
off
in
a
letter
to
Maple
Grove
by
one
lady
,
to
Ireland
by
another
.
<EOS>
Not
that
Emma
was
gay
and
thoughtless
from
any
real
felicity
;
it
was
rather
because
she
felt
less
happy
than
she
had
expected
.
<EOS>
She
laughed
because
she
was
disappointed
;
and
though
she
liked
him
for
his
attentions
,
and
thought
them
all
,
whether
in
friendship
,
admiration
,
or
playfulness
,
extremely
judicious
,
they
were
not
winning
back
her
heart
.
<EOS>
She
still
intended
him
for
her
friend
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
much
I
am
obliged
to
you
,
"
said
he
,
"
for
telling
me
to
come
to
-
day
!
 
<EOS>
If
it
had
not
been
for
you
,
I
should
certainly
have
lost
all
the
happiness
of
this
party
.
<EOS>
I
had
quite
determined
to
go
away
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
you
were
very
cross
;
and
I
do
not
know
what
about
,
except
that
you
were
too
late
for
the
best
strawberries
.
<EOS>
I
was
a
kinder
friend
than
you
deserved
.
<EOS>
But
you
were
humble
.
<EOS>
You
begged
hard
to
be
commanded
to
come
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
n't
say
I
was
cross
.
<EOS>
I
was
fatigued
.
<EOS>
The
heat
overcame
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
hotter
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Not
to
my
feelings
.
<EOS>
I
am
perfectly
comfortable
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
comfortable
because
you
are
under
command
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Your
command
?
 
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
I
intended
you
to
say
so
,
but
I
meant
self
-
command
.
<EOS>
You
had
,
somehow
or
other
,
broken
bounds
yesterday
,
and
run
away
from
your
own
management
;
but
to
-
day
you
are
got
back
again
 
<EOS>
and
as
I
can
not
be
always
with
you
,
it
is
best
to
believe
your
temper
under
your
own
command
rather
than
mine
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
comes
to
the
same
thing
.
<EOS>
I
can
have
no
self
-
command
without
a
motive
.
<EOS>
You
order
me
,
whether
you
speak
or
not
.
<EOS>
And
you
can
be
always
with
me
.
<EOS>
You
are
always
with
me
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
Dating
from
three
o'clock
yesterday
.
<EOS>
My
perpetual
influence
could
not
begin
earlier
,
or
you
would
not
have
been
so
much
out
of
humour
before
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Three
o'clock
yesterday
!
<EOS>
That
is
your
date
.
<EOS>
I
thought
I
had
seen
you
first
in
February
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Your
gallantry
is
really
unanswerable
.
<EOS>
But
(
lowering
her
voice
)
 
nobody
speaks
except
ourselves
,
and
it
is
rather
too
much
to
be
talking
nonsense
for
the
entertainment
of
seven
silent
people
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
say
nothing
of
which
I
am
ashamed
,
"
replied
he
,
with
lively
impudence
.
<EOS>
"
I
saw
you
first
in
February
.
<EOS>
Let
every
body
on
the
Hill
hear
me
if
they
can
.
<EOS>
Let
my
accents
swell
to
Mickleham
on
one
side
,
and
Dorking
on
the
other
.
<EOS>
I
saw
you
first
in
February
.
"
<EOS>
And
then
whispering
 
<EOS>
"
Our
companions
are
excessively
stupid
.
<EOS>
What
shall
we
do
to
rouse
them
?
<EOS>
Any
nonsense
will
serve
.
<EOS>
They
_
shall
_
talk
.
<EOS>
Ladies
and
gentlemen
,
I
am
ordered
by
Miss
Woodhouse
(
who
,
wherever
she
is
,
presides
)
to
say
,
that
she
desires
to
know
what
you
are
all
thinking
of
?
"
  
<EOS>
Some
laughed
,
and
answered
good
-
humouredly
.
<EOS>
Miss
Bates
said
a
great
deal
;
Mrs.
Elton
swelled
at
the
idea
of
Miss
Woodhouse
's
presiding
;
Mr.
Knightley
's
answer
was
the
most
distinct
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
Miss
Woodhouse
sure
that
she
would
like
to
hear
what
we
are
all
thinking
of
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
no
,
no
"
 
cried
Emma
,
laughing
as
carelessly
as
she
could
 
"
Upon
no
account
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
It
is
the
very
last
thing
I
would
stand
the
brunt
of
just
now
.
<EOS>
Let
me
hear
any
thing
rather
than
what
you
are
all
thinking
of
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
say
quite
all
.
<EOS>
There
are
one
or
two
,
perhaps
,
(
glancing
at
Mr.
Weston
and
Harriet
,
)
whose
thoughts
I
might
not
be
afraid
of
knowing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
sort
of
thing
,
"
cried
Mrs.
Elton
emphatically
,
"
which
_
I
_
should
not
have
thought
myself
privileged
to
inquire
into
.
<EOS>
Though
,
perhaps
,
as
the
_
Chaperon
_
of
the
party
 
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
I
_
never
was
in
any
circle
 
<EOS>
exploring
parties
 
young
ladies
 
<EOS>
married
women
 
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Her
mutterings
were
chiefly
to
her
husband
;
and
he
murmured
,
in
reply
,
  
"
Very
true
,
my
love
,
very
true
.
<EOS>
Exactly
so
,
indeed
 
quite
unheard
of
 
but
some
ladies
say
any
thing
.
<EOS>
Better
pass
it
off
as
a
joke
.
<EOS>
Every
body
knows
what
is
due
to
_
<EOS>
you
_
<EOS>
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
will
not
do
,
"
whispered
Frank
to
Emma
;
"
they
are
most
of
them
affronted
.
<EOS>
I
will
attack
them
with
more
address
.
<EOS>
Ladies
and
gentlemen
 
<EOS>
I
am
ordered
by
Miss
Woodhouse
to
say
,
that
she
waives
her
right
of
knowing
exactly
what
you
may
all
be
thinking
of
,
and
only
requires
something
very
entertaining
from
each
of
you
,
in
a
general
way
.
<EOS>
Here
are
seven
of
you
,
besides
myself
,
(
who
,
she
is
pleased
to
say
,
am
very
entertaining
already
,
)
and
she
only
demands
from
each
of
you
either
one
thing
very
clever
,
be
it
prose
or
verse
,
original
or
repeated
 
or
two
things
moderately
clever
 
or
three
things
very
dull
indeed
,
and
she
engages
to
laugh
heartily
at
them
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
<EOS>
very
well
,
"
exclaimed
Miss
Bates
,
"
then
I
need
not
be
uneasy
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Three
things
very
dull
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
That
will
just
do
for
me
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
I
shall
be
sure
to
say
three
dull
things
as
soon
as
ever
I
open
my
mouth
,
sha
n't
I
?
<EOS>
(
looking
round
with
the
most
good
-
humoured
dependence
on
every
body
's
assent
)
 
Do
not
you
all
think
I
shall
?
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
could
not
resist
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
ma'am
,
but
there
may
be
a
difficulty
.
<EOS>
Pardon
me
 
<EOS>
but
you
will
be
limited
as
to
number
 
only
three
at
once
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Bates
,
deceived
by
the
mock
ceremony
of
her
manner
,
did
not
immediately
catch
her
meaning
;
but
,
when
it
burst
on
her
,
it
could
not
anger
,
though
a
slight
blush
shewed
that
it
could
pain
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
 
<EOS>
well
 
to
be
sure
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
I
see
what
she
means
,
(
turning
to
Mr.
Knightley
,
)
and
I
will
try
to
hold
my
tongue
.
<EOS>
I
must
make
myself
very
disagreeable
,
or
she
would
not
have
said
such
a
thing
to
an
old
friend
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
like
your
plan
,

cried
Mr.
Weston
.
<EOS>
"
Agreed
,
agreed
.
<EOS>
I
will
do
my
best

I
am
making
a
conundrum

How
will
a
conundrum
reckon
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Low
,
I
am
afraid
,
sir
,
very
low
,
"
answered
his
son
;
 
"
but
we
shall
be
indulgent
 
especially
to
any
one
who
leads
the
way

<EOS>

"
No
,
no
,
"
said
Emma
,
"
it
will
not
reckon
low
.
<EOS>
A
conundrum
of
Mr.
Weston

shall
clear
him
and
his
next
neighbour

Come

sir

pray
let
me
hear
it

I
doubt
its
being
very
clever
myself
,
"
said
Mr.
Weston
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
too
much
a
matter
of
fact
,
but
here
it
is
.
 
<EOS>
What
two
letters
of
the
alphabet
are
there
,
that
express
perfection
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
two
letters
!
 
<EOS>
express
perfection
!
<EOS>
I
am
sure
I
do
not
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
you
will
never
guess
.
<EOS>
You
,
(
to
Emma
)
,
I
am
certain
,
will
never
guess
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
tell
you
.
 
<EOS>
M.
and
A.
 
Em
-
ma
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
understand
?
"
  
<EOS>
Understanding
and
gratification
came
together
.
<EOS>
It
might
be
a
very
indifferent
piece
of
wit
,
but
Emma
found
a
great
deal
to
laugh
at
and
enjoy
in
it
 
and
so
did
Frank
and
Harriet
.
 
<EOS>
It
did
not
seem
to
touch
the
rest
of
the
party
equally
;
some
looked
very
stupid
about
it
,
and
Mr.
Knightley
gravely
said
,
  
"
This
explains
the
sort
of
clever
thing
that
is
wanted
,
and
Mr.
Weston
has
done
very
well
for
himself
;
but
he
must
have
knocked
up
every
body
else
.
<EOS>
_
Perfection
_
should
not
have
come
quite
so
soon
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
for
myself
,
I
protest
I
must
be
excused
,
"
said
Mrs.
Elton
;
"
_
<EOS>
I
_
<EOS>
really
can
not
attempt
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
at
all
fond
of
the
sort
of
thing
.
<EOS>
I
had
an
acrostic
once
sent
to
me
upon
my
own
name
,
which
I
was
not
at
all
pleased
with
.
<EOS>
I
knew
who
it
came
from
.
<EOS>
An
abominable
puppy
!
 
<EOS>
You
know
who
I
mean
<EOS>
(
nodding
to
her
husband
)
.
<EOS>
These
kind
of
things
are
very
well
at
Christmas
,
when
one
is
sitting
round
the
fire
;
but
quite
out
of
place
,
in
my
opinion
,
when
one
is
exploring
about
the
country
in
summer
.
<EOS>
Miss
Woodhouse
must
excuse
me
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
one
of
those
who
have
witty
things
at
every
body
's
service
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
pretend
to
be
a
wit
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
great
deal
of
vivacity
in
my
own
way
,
but
I
really
must
be
allowed
to
judge
when
to
speak
and
when
to
hold
my
tongue
.
<EOS>
Pass
us
,
if
you
please
,
Mr.
Churchill
.
<EOS>
Pass
Mr.
E.
,
Knightley
,
Jane
,
and
myself
.
<EOS>
We
have
nothing
clever
to
say
 
not
one
of
us
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
yes
,
pray
pass
_
me
_
,
"
added
her
husband
,
with
a
sort
of
sneering
consciousness
;
"
_
I
_
have
nothing
to
say
that
can
entertain
Miss
Woodhouse
,
or
any
other
young
lady
.
<EOS>
An
old
married
man
 
quite
good
for
nothing
.
<EOS>
Shall
we
walk
,
Augusta
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
With
all
my
heart
.
<EOS>
I
am
really
tired
of
exploring
so
long
on
one
spot
.
<EOS>
Come
,
Jane
,
take
my
other
arm
.
"
  
<EOS>
Jane
declined
it
,
however
,
and
the
husband
and
wife
walked
off
.
<EOS>
"
Happy
couple
!
"
said
Frank
Churchill
,
as
soon
as
they
were
out
of
hearing
:
 
<EOS>
"
How
well
they
suit
one
another
!
 
<EOS>
Very
lucky
 
marrying
as
they
did
,
upon
an
acquaintance
formed
only
in
a
public
place
!
 
<EOS>
They
only
knew
each
other
,
I
think
,
a
few
weeks
in
Bath
!
<EOS>
Peculiarly
lucky
!
 
<EOS>
for
as
to
any
real
knowledge
of
a
person
's
disposition
that
Bath
,
or
any
public
place
,
can
give
 
it
is
all
nothing
;
there
can
be
no
knowledge
.
<EOS>
It
is
only
by
seeing
women
in
their
own
homes
,
among
their
own
set
,
just
as
they
always
are
,
that
you
can
form
any
just
judgment
.
<EOS>
Short
of
that
,
it
is
all
guess
and
luck
 
and
will
generally
be
ill
-
luck
.
<EOS>
How
many
a
man
has
committed
himself
on
a
short
acquaintance
,
and
rued
it
all
the
rest
of
his
life
!
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Fairfax
,
who
had
seldom
spoken
before
,
except
among
her
own
confederates
,
spoke
now
.
  
<EOS>
"
Such
things
do
occur
,
undoubtedly
.
"
 
<EOS>
She
was
stopped
by
a
cough
.
<EOS>
Frank
Churchill
turned
towards
her
to
listen
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
were
speaking
,
"
said
he
,
gravely
.
<EOS>
She
recovered
her
voice
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
only
going
to
observe
,
that
though
such
unfortunate
circumstances
do
sometimes
occur
both
to
men
and
women
<EOS>
,
I
can
not
imagine
them
to
be
very
frequent
.
<EOS>
A
hasty
and
imprudent
attachment
may
arise
 
but
there
is
generally
time
to
recover
from
it
afterwards
.
<EOS>
I
would
be
understood
to
mean
,
that
it
can
be
only
weak
,
irresolute
characters
,
(
whose
happiness
must
be
always
at
the
mercy
of
chance
,
)
who
will
suffer
an
unfortunate
acquaintance
to
be
an
inconvenience
,
an
oppression
for
ever
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
made
no
answer
;
merely
looked
,
and
bowed
in
submission
;
and
soon
afterwards
said
,
in
a
lively
tone
,
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
have
so
little
confidence
in
my
own
judgment
,
that
whenever
I
marry
,
I
hope
some
body
will
chuse
my
wife
for
me
.
<EOS>
Will
you
?
<EOS>
(
turning
to
Emma
.
)
<EOS>
Will
you
chuse
a
wife
for
me
?
 
<EOS>
I
am
sure
I
should
like
any
body
fixed
on
by
you
.
<EOS>
You
provide
for
the
family
,
you
know
,
(
with
a
smile
at
his
father
)
.
<EOS>
Find
some
body
for
me
.
<EOS>
I
am
in
no
hurry
.
<EOS>
Adopt
her
,
educate
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
make
her
like
myself
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
By
all
means
,
if
you
can
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
well
.
<EOS>
I
undertake
the
commission
.
<EOS>
You
shall
have
a
charming
wife
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
must
be
very
lively
,
and
have
hazle
eyes
.
<EOS>
I
care
for
nothing
else
.
<EOS>
I
shall
go
abroad
for
a
couple
of
years
 
and
when
I
return
,
I
shall
come
to
you
for
my
wife
.
<EOS>
Remember
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
was
in
no
danger
of
forgetting
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
commission
to
touch
every
favourite
feeling
.
<EOS>
Would
not
Harriet
be
the
very
creature
described
?
<EOS>
Hazle
eyes
excepted
,
two
years
more
might
make
her
all
that
he
wished
.
<EOS>
He
might
even
have
Harriet
in
his
thoughts
at
the
moment
;
who
could
say
?
<EOS>
Referring
the
education
to
her
seemed
to
imply
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
ma'am
,
"
said
Jane
to
her
aunt
,
"
shall
we
join
Mrs.
Elton
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
please
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
With
all
my
heart
.
<EOS>
I
am
quite
ready
.
<EOS>
I
was
ready
to
have
gone
with
her
,
but
this
will
do
just
as
well
.
<EOS>
We
shall
soon
overtake
her
.
<EOS>
There
she
is
 
<EOS>
no
,
that
's
somebody
else
.
<EOS>
That
's
one
of
the
ladies
in
the
Irish
car
party
,
not
at
all
like
her
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
I
declare
 
<EOS>
"
  
They
walked
off
,
followed
in
half
a
minute
by
Mr.
Knightley
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Weston
,
his
son
,
Emma
,
and
Harriet
,
only
remained
;
and
the
young
man
's
spirits
now
rose
to
a
pitch
almost
unpleasant
.
<EOS>
Even
Emma
grew
tired
at
last
of
flattery
and
merriment
,
and
wished
herself
rather
walking
quietly
about
with
any
of
the
others
,
or
sitting
almost
alone
,
and
quite
unattended
to
,
in
tranquil
observation
of
the
beautiful
views
beneath
her
.
<EOS>
The
appearance
of
the
servants
looking
out
for
them
to
give
notice
of
the
carriages
was
a
joyful
sight
;
and
even
the
bustle
of
collecting
and
preparing
to
depart
,
and
the
solicitude
of
Mrs.
Elton
to
have
_
her
_
carriage
first
,
were
gladly
endured
,
in
the
prospect
of
the
quiet
drive
home
which
was
to
close
the
very
questionable
enjoyments
of
this
day
of
pleasure
.
<EOS>
Such
another
scheme
,
composed
of
so
many
ill
-
assorted
people
<EOS>
,
she
hoped
never
to
be
betrayed
into
again
.
  
<EOS>
While
waiting
for
the
carriage
,
she
found
Mr.
Knightley
by
her
side
.
<EOS>
He
looked
around
,
as
if
to
see
that
no
one
were
near
,
and
then
said
,
  
"
Emma
,
I
must
once
more
speak
to
you
as
I
have
been
used
to
do
:
<EOS>
a
privilege
rather
endured
than
allowed
,
perhaps
,
but
I
must
still
use
it
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
see
you
acting
wrong
,
without
a
remonstrance
.
<EOS>
How
could
you
be
so
unfeeling
to
Miss
Bates
?
<EOS>
How
could
you
be
so
insolent
in
your
wit
to
a
woman
of
her
character
,
age
,
and
situation
?
 
<EOS>
Emma
,
I
had
not
thought
it
possible
.
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
recollected
,
blushed
,
was
sorry
,
but
tried
to
laugh
it
off
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
how
could
I
help
saying
what
I
did
?
 
<EOS>
Nobody
could
have
helped
it
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
so
very
bad
.
<EOS>
I
dare
say
she
did
not
understand
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
assure
you
she
did
.
<EOS>
She
felt
your
full
meaning
.
<EOS>
She
has
talked
of
it
since
.
<EOS>
I
wish
you
could
have
heard
how
she
talked
of
it
 
with
what
candour
and
generosity
.
<EOS>
I
wish
you
could
have
heard
her
honouring
your
forbearance
,
in
being
able
to
pay
her
such
attentions
,
as
she
was
for
ever
receiving
from
yourself
and
your
father
,
when
her
society
must
be
so
irksome
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
"
cried
Emma
,
"
I
know
there
is
not
a
better
creature
in
the
world
:
but
you
must
allow
,
that
what
is
good
and
what
is
ridiculous
are
most
unfortunately
blended
in
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
are
blended
,
"
said
he
,
"
I
acknowledge
;
and
,
were
she
prosperous
,
I
could
allow
much
for
the
occasional
prevalence
of
the
ridiculous
over
the
good
.
<EOS>
Were
she
a
woman
of
fortune
,
I
would
leave
every
harmless
absurdity
to
take
its
chance
,
I
would
not
quarrel
with
you
for
any
liberties
of
manner
.
<EOS>
Were
she
your
equal
in
situation
 
<EOS>
but
,
Emma
,
consider
how
far
this
is
from
being
the
case
.
<EOS>
She
is
poor
;
she
has
sunk
from
the
comforts
she
was
born
to
;
and
,
if
she
live
to
old
age
,
must
probably
sink
more
.
<EOS>
Her
situation
should
secure
your
compassion
.
<EOS>
It
was
badly
done
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
You
,
whom
she
had
known
from
an
infant
,
whom
she
had
seen
grow
up
from
a
period
when
her
notice
was
an
honour
,
to
have
you
now
,
in
thoughtless
spirits
,
and
the
pride
of
the
moment
,
laugh
at
her
,
humble
her
 
and
before
her
niece
,
too
 
and
before
others
,
many
of
whom
(
certainly
_
some
_
,
)
would
be
entirely
guided
by
_
your
_
treatment
of
her
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
not
pleasant
to
you
,
Emma
 
<EOS>
and
it
is
very
far
from
pleasant
to
me
;
but
<EOS>
I
must
,
I
will
,
 
I
will
tell
you
truths
while
I
can
;
satisfied
with
proving
myself
your
friend
by
very
faithful
counsel
,
and
trusting
that
you
will
<EOS>
some
time
or
other
do
me
greater
justice
than
you
can
do
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
While
they
talked
,
they
were
advancing
towards
the
carriage
;
it
was
ready
;
and
,
before
she
could
speak
again
,
he
had
handed
her
in
.
<EOS>
He
had
misinterpreted
the
feelings
which
had
kept
her
face
averted
,
and
her
tongue
motionless
.
<EOS>
They
were
combined
only
of
anger
against
herself
,
mortification
,
and
deep
concern
.
<EOS>
She
had
not
been
able
to
speak
;
and
,
on
entering
the
carriage
,
sunk
back
for
a
moment
<EOS>
overcome
 
then
reproaching
herself
for
having
taken
no
leave
,
making
no
acknowledgment
,
parting
in
apparent
sullenness
,
she
looked
out
with
voice
and
hand
eager
to
shew
a
difference
;
but
it
was
just
too
late
.
<EOS>
He
had
turned
away
,
and
the
horses
were
in
motion
.
<EOS>
She
continued
to
look
back
,
but
in
vain
;
and
soon
,
with
what
appeared
unusual
speed
,
they
were
half
way
down
the
hill
,
and
every
thing
left
far
behind
.
<EOS>
She
was
vexed
beyond
what
could
have
been
expressed
 
almost
beyond
what
she
could
conceal
.
<EOS>
Never
had
she
felt
so
agitated
,
mortified
,
<EOS>
grieved
,
at
any
circumstance
in
her
life
.
<EOS>
She
was
most
forcibly
struck
.
<EOS>
The
truth
of
this
representation
there
was
no
denying
.
<EOS>
She
felt
it
at
her
heart
.
<EOS>
How
could
she
have
been
so
brutal
,
so
cruel
to
Miss
Bates
!
<EOS>
How
could
she
have
exposed
herself
to
such
ill
opinion
in
any
one
she
valued
!
<EOS>
And
how
suffer
him
to
leave
her
without
saying
one
word
of
gratitude
,
of
concurrence
,
of
common
kindness
!
  
<EOS>
Time
did
not
compose
her
.
<EOS>
As
she
reflected
more
,
she
seemed
but
to
feel
it
more
.
<EOS>
She
never
had
been
so
depressed
.
<EOS>
Happily
it
was
not
necessary
to
speak
.
<EOS>
There
was
only
Harriet
,
who
seemed
not
in
spirits
herself
,
fagged
,
and
very
willing
to
be
silent
;
and
Emma
felt
the
tears
running
down
her
cheeks
almost
all
the
way
home
,
without
being
at
any
trouble
to
check
them
,
extraordinary
as
they
were
.
    
<EOS>
The
wretchedness
of
a
scheme
to
Box
Hill
was
in
Emma
's
thoughts
all
the
evening
.
<EOS>
How
it
might
be
considered
by
the
rest
of
the
party
,
she
could
not
tell
.
<EOS>
They
,
in
their
different
homes
,
and
their
different
ways
,
might
be
looking
back
on
it
with
pleasure
;
but
in
her
view
it
was
a
morning
more
completely
misspent
,
more
totally
bare
of
rational
satisfaction
at
the
time
,
and
more
to
be
abhorred
in
recollection
,
than
any
she
had
ever
passed
.
<EOS>
A
whole
evening
of
back
-
gammon
with
her
father
,
was
felicity
to
it
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
There
_
,
indeed
,
lay
real
pleasure
,
for
there
she
was
giving
up
the
sweetest
hours
of
the
twenty
-
four
to
his
comfort
;
and
feeling
that
,
unmerited
as
might
be
the
degree
of
his
fond
affection
and
confiding
esteem
,
she
could
not
,
in
her
general
conduct
,
be
open
to
any
severe
reproach
.
<EOS>
As
a
daughter
,
she
hoped
she
was
not
without
a
heart
.
<EOS>
She
hoped
no
one
could
have
said
to
her
,
"
How
could
you
be
so
unfeeling
to
your
father
?
 
<EOS>
I
must
,
I
will
tell
you
truths
while
I
can
.
"
<EOS>
Miss
Bates
should
never
again
 
no
,
never
!
<EOS>
If
attention
,
in
future
,
could
do
away
the
past
,
she
might
hope
to
be
forgiven
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
often
remiss
,
her
conscience
told
her
so
;
remiss
,
perhaps
,
more
in
thought
than
fact
;
scornful
,
ungracious
.
<EOS>
But
it
should
be
so
no
more
.
<EOS>
In
the
warmth
of
true
contrition
,
she
would
call
upon
her
the
very
next
morning
,
and
it
should
be
the
beginning
,
on
her
side
,
of
a
regular
,
equal
,
kindly
intercourse
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
just
as
determined
when
the
morrow
came
,
and
went
early
,
that
nothing
might
prevent
her
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
unlikely
,
she
thought
,
that
she
might
see
Mr.
Knightley
in
her
way
;
or
,
perhaps
,
he
might
come
in
while
she
were
paying
her
visit
.
<EOS>
She
had
no
objection
.
<EOS>
She
would
not
be
ashamed
of
the
appearance
of
the
penitence
,
so
justly
and
truly
hers
.
<EOS>
Her
eyes
were
towards
Donwell
as
she
walked
,
but
she
saw
him
not
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
ladies
were
all
at
home
.
<EOS>
"
She
had
never
rejoiced
at
the
sound
before
,
nor
ever
before
entered
the
passage
,
nor
walked
up
the
stairs
,
with
any
wish
of
giving
pleasure
,
but
in
conferring
obligation
,
or
of
deriving
it
,
except
in
subsequent
ridicule
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
bustle
on
her
approach
;
a
good
deal
of
moving
and
talking
.
<EOS>
She
heard
Miss
Bates
's
voice
,
something
was
to
be
done
in
a
hurry
;
the
maid
looked
frightened
and
awkward
;
hoped
she
would
be
pleased
to
wait
a
moment
,
and
then
ushered
her
in
too
soon
.
<EOS>
The
aunt
and
niece
seemed
both
escaping
into
the
adjoining
room
.
<EOS>
Jane
she
had
a
distinct
glimpse
of
,
looking
extremely
ill
;
and
,
before
the
door
had
shut
them
out
,
she
heard
Miss
Bates
saying
,
"
Well
,
my
dear
,
I
shall
_
say
_
you
are
laid
down
upon
the
bed
,
and
I
am
sure
you
are
ill
enough
.
"
  
<EOS>
Poor
old
Mrs.
Bates
,
civil
and
humble
as
usual
,
looked
as
if
she
did
not
quite
understand
what
was
going
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
afraid
Jane
is
not
very
well
,
"
said
she
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
do
not
know
;
they
_
tell
_
me
she
is
well
.
<EOS>
I
dare
say
my
daughter
will
be
here
presently
,
Miss
Woodhouse
.
<EOS>
I
hope
you
find
a
chair
.
<EOS>
I
wish
Hetty
had
not
gone
.
<EOS>
I
am
very
little
able
 
<EOS>
Have
you
a
chair
,
ma'am
?
<EOS>
Do
you
sit
where
you
like
?
<EOS>
I
am
sure
she
will
be
here
presently
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
seriously
hoped
she
would
.
<EOS>
She
had
a
moment
's
fear
of
Miss
Bates
keeping
away
from
her
.
<EOS>
But
Miss
Bates
soon
came
 
"
Very
happy
and
obliged
"
 
<EOS>
but
Emma
's
conscience
told
her
that
there
was
not
the
same
cheerful
volubility
as
before
 
less
ease
of
look
and
manner
.
<EOS>
A
very
friendly
inquiry
after
Miss
Fairfax
,
she
hoped
,
might
lead
the
way
to
a
return
of
old
feelings
.
<EOS>
The
touch
seemed
immediate
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
Miss
Woodhouse
,
how
kind
you
are
!
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
you
have
heard
 
and
are
come
to
give
us
joy
.
<EOS>
This
does
not
seem
much
like
joy
,
indeed
,
in
me
 
(
twinkling
away
a
tear
or
two
)
 
but
it
will
be
very
trying
for
us
to
part
with
her
,
after
having
had
her
so
long
,
and
she
has
a
dreadful
headache
just
now
,
writing
all
the
morning
:
 
<EOS>
such
long
letters
,
you
know
,
to
be
written
to
Colonel
Campbell
,
and
Mrs.
Dixon
.
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
"
said
I
,
"
you
will
blind
yourself
"
 
for
tears
were
in
her
eyes
perpetually
.
<EOS>
One
can
not
wonder
,
one
can
not
wonder
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
great
change
;
and
though
she
is
amazingly
fortunate
 
<EOS>
such
a
situation
<EOS>
,
I
suppose
,
as
no
young
woman
before
ever
met
with
on
first
going
out
 
do
not
think
us
ungrateful
,
Miss
Woodhouse
,
for
such
surprising
good
fortune
 
(
again
dispersing
her
tears
)
 
<EOS>
but
,
poor
dear
soul
!
<EOS>
if
you
were
to
see
what
a
headache
she
has
.
<EOS>
When
one
is
in
great
pain
,
you
know
one
can
not
feel
any
blessing
quite
as
it
may
deserve
.
<EOS>
She
is
as
low
as
possible
.
<EOS>
To
look
at
her
,
nobody
would
think
how
delighted
and
happy
she
is
to
have
secured
such
a
situation
.
<EOS>
You
will
excuse
her
not
coming
to
you
 
<EOS>
she
is
not
able
 
<EOS>
she
is
gone
into
her
own
room
 
<EOS>
I
want
her
to
lie
down
upon
the
bed
.
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
"
said
I
,
"
I
shall
say
you
are
laid
down
upon
the
bed
:
"
but
,
however
,
she
is
not
;
she
is
walking
about
the
room
.
<EOS>
But
,
now
that
she
has
written
her
letters
<EOS>
,
she
says
she
shall
soon
be
well
.
<EOS>
She
will
be
extremely
sorry
to
miss
seeing
you
,
Miss
Woodhouse
,
but
your
kindness
will
excuse
her
.
<EOS>
You
were
kept
waiting
at
the
door
 
<EOS>
I
was
quite
ashamed
 
<EOS>
but
somehow
there
was
a
little
bustle
 
<EOS>
for
it
so
happened
that
we
had
not
heard
the
knock
,
and
till
you
were
on
the
stairs
<EOS>
,
we
did
not
know
any
body
was
coming
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
only
Mrs.
Cole
,
"
said
I
,
"
depend
upon
it
.
<EOS>
Nobody
else
would
come
so
early
.
"
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
said
she
,
"
it
must
be
borne
some
time
or
other
,
and
it
may
as
well
be
now
.
<EOS>
"
But
then
Patty
came
in
,
and
said
it
was
you
.
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
"
said
I
,
"
it
is
Miss
Woodhouse
:
<EOS>
I
am
sure
you
will
like
to
see
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
see
nobody
,
"
said
she
;
and
up
she
got
,
and
would
go
away
;
and
that
was
what
made
us
keep
you
waiting
 
and
extremely
sorry
and
ashamed
we
were
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
must
go
,
my
dear
,
"
said
I
,
"
you
must
,
and
I
will
say
you
are
laid
down
upon
the
bed
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
was
most
sincerely
interested
.
<EOS>
Her
heart
had
been
long
growing
kinder
towards
Jane
;
and
this
picture
of
her
present
sufferings
acted
as
a
cure
of
every
former
ungenerous
suspicion
,
and
left
her
nothing
but
pity
;
and
the
remembrance
of
the
less
just
and
less
gentle
sensations
of
the
past
,
obliged
her
to
admit
that
Jane
might
very
naturally
resolve
on
seeing
Mrs.
Cole
or
any
other
steady
friend
,
when
she
might
not
bear
to
see
herself
.
<EOS>
She
spoke
as
she
felt
,
with
earnest
regret
and
solicitude
 
sincerely
wishing
that
the
circumstances
which
she
collected
from
Miss
Bates
to
be
now
actually
determined
on
,
might
be
as
much
for
Miss
Fairfax
's
advantage
and
comfort
as
possible
.
<EOS>
"
It
must
be
a
severe
trial
to
them
all
.
<EOS>
She
had
understood
it
was
to
be
delayed
till
Colonel
Campbell
's
return
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
So
very
kind
!
"
replied
Miss
Bates
.
<EOS>
"
But
you
are
always
kind
.
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
no
bearing
such
an
"
always
;
"
and
to
break
through
her
dreadful
gratitude
,
Emma
made
the
direct
inquiry
of
    
<EOS>
"
Where
 
may
I
ask
?
 
<EOS>
is
Miss
Fairfax
going
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
To
a
Mrs.
Smallridge
 
charming
woman
 
most
superior
 
to
have
the
charge
of
her
three
little
girls
 
delightful
children
.
<EOS>
Impossible
that
any
situation
could
be
more
replete
with
comfort
;
if
we
except
,
perhaps
,
Mrs.
Suckling
's
own
family
,
and
Mrs.
Bragge
's
;
but
Mrs.
Smallridge
is
intimate
with
both
,
and
in
the
very
same
neighbourhood
:
 
lives
only
four
miles
from
Maple
Grove
.
<EOS>
Jane
will
be
only
four
miles
from
Maple
Grove
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Elton
,
I
suppose
,
has
been
the
person
to
whom
Miss
Fairfax
owes
 
"
  
"
Yes
,
our
good
Mrs.
Elton
.
<EOS>
The
most
indefatigable
,
true
friend
.
<EOS>
She
would
not
take
a
denial
.
<EOS>
She
would
not
let
Jane
say
,
"
No
;
"
for
when
Jane
first
heard
of
it
,
(
it
was
the
day
before
yesterday
,
the
very
morning
we
were
at
Donwell
,
)
<EOS>
when
Jane
first
heard
of
it
,
she
was
quite
decided
against
accepting
the
offer
,
and
for
the
reasons
you
mention
;
exactly
as
you
say
,
she
had
made
up
her
mind
to
close
with
nothing
till
Colonel
Campbell
's
return
,
and
nothing
should
induce
her
to
enter
into
any
engagement
at
present
 
<EOS>
and
so
she
told
Mrs.
Elton
over
and
over
again
 
<EOS>
and
I
am
sure
I
had
no
more
idea
that
she
would
change
her
mind
!
 
<EOS>
but
that
good
Mrs.
Elton
,
whose
judgment
never
fails
her
,
saw
farther
than
I
did
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
every
body
that
would
have
stood
out
in
such
a
kind
way
as
she
did
,
and
refuse
to
take
Jane
's
answer
;
but
she
positively
declared
she
would
_
not
_
write
any
such
denial
yesterday
,
as
Jane
wished
her
;
she
would
wait
 
and
,
sure
enough
,
<EOS>
yesterday
evening
it
was
all
settled
that
Jane
should
go
.
<EOS>
Quite
a
surprize
to
me
!
<EOS>
I
had
not
the
least
idea
!
 
<EOS>
Jane
took
Mrs.
Elton
aside
,
and
told
her
at
once
,
that
upon
thinking
over
the
advantages
of
Mrs.
Smallridge
's
situation
,
she
had
come
to
the
resolution
of
accepting
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
did
not
know
a
word
of
it
till
it
was
all
settled
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
spent
the
evening
with
Mrs.
Elton
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Yes
,
all
of
us
;
Mrs.
Elton
would
have
us
come
.
<EOS>
It
was
settled
so
,
upon
the
hill
,
while
we
were
walking
about
with
Mr.
Knightley
.
<EOS>
"
You
_
must
_
_
<EOS>
all
_
spend
your
evening
with
us
,
"
said
she
 
<EOS>
"
I
positively
must
have
you
<EOS>
_
all
_
come
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
"
Mr.
Knightley
was
there
too
,
was
he
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
not
Mr.
Knightley
;
he
declined
it
from
the
first
;
and
though
I
thought
he
would
come
,
because
Mrs.
Elton
declared
she
would
not
let
him
off
,
he
did
not
;
 
but
my
mother
,
and
Jane
,
and
<EOS>
I
,
were
all
there
,
and
a
very
agreeable
evening
we
had
.
<EOS>
Such
kind
friends
,
you
know
,
Miss
Woodhouse
,
one
must
always
find
agreeable
,
though
every
body
seemed
rather
fagged
after
the
morning
's
party
.
<EOS>
Even
pleasure
,
you
know
,
is
fatiguing
 
<EOS>
and
I
can
not
say
that
any
of
them
seemed
very
much
to
have
enjoyed
it
.
<EOS>
However
,
_
I
_
shall
always
think
it
a
very
pleasant
party
,
and
feel
extremely
obliged
to
the
kind
friends
who
included
me
in
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Fairfax
,
I
suppose
,
though
you
were
not
aware
of
it
,
had
been
making
up
her
mind
the
whole
day
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
dare
say
she
had
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Whenever
the
time
may
come
,
it
must
be
unwelcome
to
her
and
all
her
friends
 
<EOS>
but
I
hope
her
engagement
will
have
every
alleviation
that
is
possible
 
<EOS>
I
mean
,
as
to
the
character
and
manners
of
the
family
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
dear
Miss
Woodhouse
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
indeed
,
there
is
every
thing
in
the
world
that
can
make
her
happy
in
it
.
<EOS>
Except
the
Sucklings
and
Bragges
,
there
is
not
such
another
nursery
establishment
,
so
liberal
and
elegant
,
in
all
Mrs.
Elton
's
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Smallridge
,
a
most
delightful
woman
!
 
<EOS>
A
style
of
living
almost
equal
to
Maple
Grove
 
<EOS>
and
as
to
the
children
,
except
the
little
Sucklings
and
little
Bragges
,
there
are
not
such
elegant
sweet
children
anywhere
.
<EOS>
Jane
will
be
treated
with
such
regard
and
kindness
!
 
<EOS>
It
will
be
nothing
but
pleasure
,
a
life
of
pleasure
.
 
<EOS>
And
her
salary
!
 
<EOS>
I
really
can
not
venture
to
name
her
salary
to
you
,
Miss
Woodhouse
.
<EOS>
Even
you
,
used
as
you
are
to
great
sums
,
would
hardly
believe
that
so
much
could
be
given
to
a
young
person
like
Jane
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
madam
,
"
cried
Emma
,
"
if
other
children
are
at
all
like
what
I
remember
to
have
been
myself
,
I
should
think
five
times
the
amount
of
what
I
have
ever
yet
heard
named
as
a
salary
on
such
occasions
,
dearly
earned
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
so
noble
in
your
ideas
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
when
is
Miss
Fairfax
to
leave
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
soon
,
very
soon
,
indeed
;
that
's
the
worst
of
it
.
<EOS>
Within
a
fortnight
.

Mrs.
Smallridge
is
in
a
great
hurry
.
<EOS>
My
poor
mother
does
not
know
how
to
bear
it
.
<EOS>
So
then
,
I
try
to
put
it
out
of
her
thoughts
,
and
say
,
Come
ma'am
,
do
not
let
us
think
about
it
any
more
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Her
friends
must
all
be
sorry
to
lose
her
;
and
will
not
Colonel
and
Mrs.
Campbell
be
sorry
to
find
that
she
has
engaged
herself
before
their
return
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
Jane
says
she
is
sure
they
will
;
but
yet
,
this
is
such
a
situation
as
she
can
not
feel
herself
justified
in
declining
.
<EOS>
I
was
so
astonished
when
she
first
told
me
what
she
had
been
saying
to
Mrs.
Elton
,
and
when
Mrs.
Elton
at
the
same
moment
came
congratulating
me
upon
it
!
<EOS>
It
was
before
tea
 
<EOS>
stay
 
<EOS>
no
,
it
could
not
be
before
tea
,
because
we
were
just
going
to
cards
 
<EOS>
and
yet
it
was
before
tea
,
because
I
remember
thinking
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
no
,
now
I
recollect
,
<EOS>
now
I
have
it
;
something
happened
before
tea
,
but
not
that
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Elton
was
called
out
of
the
room
before
tea
,
old
John
Abdy
's
son
wanted
to
speak
with
him
.
<EOS>
Poor
old
John
,
I
have
a
great
regard
for
him
;
he
was
clerk
to
my
poor
father
twenty
-
seven
years
;
and
now
,
poor
old
man
,
he
is
bed
-
ridden
,
and
very
poorly
with
the
rheumatic
gout
in
his
joints
 
<EOS>
I
must
go
and
see
him
to
-
day
;
and
so
will
Jane
,
I
am
sure
,
if
she
gets
out
at
all
.
<EOS>
And
poor
John
's
son
came
to
talk
to
Mr.
Elton
about
relief
from
the
parish
;
he
is
very
well
to
do
himself
,
you
know
,
being
head
man
at
the
Crown
,
ostler
,
and
every
thing
of
that
sort
,
but
still
he
can
not
keep
his
father
without
some
help
;
and
<EOS>
so
,
when
Mr.
Elton
came
back
,
he
told
us
what
John
ostler
had
been
telling
him
,
and
then
it
came
out
about
the
chaise
having
been
sent
to
Randalls
to
take
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
to
Richmond
.
<EOS>
That
was
what
happened
before
tea
.
<EOS>
It
was
after
tea
that
Jane
spoke
to
Mrs.
Elton
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Bates
would
hardly
give
Emma
time
to
say
how
perfectly
new
this
circumstance
was
to
her
;
but
as
without
supposing
it
possible
that
she
could
be
ignorant
of
any
of
the
particulars
of
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
's
going
,
she
proceeded
to
give
them
all
,
it
was
of
no
consequence
.
  
<EOS>
What
Mr.
Elton
had
learned
from
the
ostler
on
the
subject
,
being
the
accumulation
of
the
ostler
's
own
knowledge
,
and
the
knowledge
of
the
servants
at
Randalls
,
was
,
that
a
messenger
had
come
over
from
Richmond
soon
after
the
return
of
the
party
from
Box
Hill
 
<EOS>
which
messenger
,
however
,
had
been
no
more
than
was
expected
;
and
that
Mr.
Churchill
had
sent
his
nephew
a
few
lines
,
containing
,
upon
the
whole
,
a
tolerable
account
of
Mrs.
Churchill
,
and
only
wishing
him
not
to
delay
coming
back
beyond
the
next
morning
early
;
but
that
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
having
resolved
to
go
home
directly
,
without
waiting
at
all
,
and
his
horse
seeming
to
have
got
a
cold
,
Tom
had
been
sent
off
immediately
for
the
Crown
chaise
,
and
the
ostler
had
stood
out
and
seen
it
pass
by
,
the
boy
going
a
good
pace
,
and
driving
very
steady
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
nothing
in
all
this
either
to
astonish
or
interest
,
and
it
caught
Emma
's
attention
only
as
it
united
with
the
subject
which
already
engaged
her
mind
.
<EOS>
The
contrast
between
Mrs.
Churchill
's
importance
in
the
world
,
and
Jane
Fairfax
's
,
struck
her
;
one
was
every
thing
,
the
other
nothing
 
<EOS>
and
she
sat
musing
on
the
difference
of
woman
's
destiny
,
and
quite
unconscious
on
what
her
eyes
were
fixed
,
till
roused
by
Miss
Bates
's
saying
,
  
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
I
see
what
you
are
thinking
of
,
the
pianoforte
.
<EOS>
What
is
to
become
of
that
?
 
<EOS>
Very
true
.
<EOS>
Poor
dear
Jane
was
talking
of
it
just
now
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
must
go
,
"
said
she
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
You
and
I
must
part
.
<EOS>
You
will
have
no
business
here
.
 
<EOS>
Let
it
stay
<EOS>
,
however
,
"
said
she
;
"
give
it
houseroom
till
Colonel
Campbell
comes
back
.
<EOS>
I
shall
talk
about
it
to
him
;
he
will
settle
for
me
;
he
will
help
me
out
of
all
my
difficulties
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
to
this
day
,
I
do
believe
,
she
knows
not
whether
it
was
his
present
or
his
daughter
's
.
"
  
<EOS>
Now
Emma
was
obliged
to
think
of
the
pianoforte
;
and
the
remembrance
of
all
her
former
fanciful
and
unfair
conjectures
was
so
little
pleasing
,
that
she
soon
allowed
herself
to
believe
her
visit
had
been
long
enough
;
and
,
with
a
repetition
of
every
thing
that
she
could
venture
to
say
of
the
good
wishes
which
she
really
felt
,
took
leave
.
    
<EOS>
Emma
's
pensive
meditations
,
as
she
walked
home
,
were
not
interrupted
;
but
on
entering
the
parlour
,
she
found
those
who
must
rouse
her
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Knightley
and
Harriet
had
arrived
during
her
absence
,
and
were
sitting
with
her
father
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Knightley
immediately
got
up
,
and
in
a
manner
decidedly
graver
than
usual
,
said
,
  
"
I
would
not
go
away
without
seeing
you
,
but
I
have
no
time
to
spare
,
and
therefore
must
now
be
gone
directly
.
<EOS>
I
am
going
to
London
,
to
spend
a
few
days
with
John
and
Isabella
.
<EOS>
Have
you
any
thing
to
send
or
say
,
besides
the
"
love
,
"
which
nobody
carries
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nothing
at
all
.
<EOS>
But
is
not
this
a
sudden
scheme
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
 
<EOS>
rather
 
I
have
been
thinking
of
it
some
little
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
was
sure
he
had
not
forgiven
her
;
he
looked
unlike
himself
.
<EOS>
Time
,
however
,
she
thought
,
would
tell
him
that
they
ought
to
be
friends
again
.
<EOS>
While
he
stood
,
as
if
meaning
to
go
,
but
not
going
 
her
father
began
his
inquiries
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
my
dear
,
and
did
you
get
there
safely
?
 
<EOS>
And
how
did
you
find
my
worthy
old
friend
and
her
daughter
?
 
<EOS>
I
dare
say
they
must
have
been
very
much
obliged
to
you
for
coming
.
<EOS>
Dear
Emma
has
been
to
call
on
Mrs.
and
Miss
Bates
,
Mr.
Knightley
,
as
I
told
you
before
.
<EOS>
She
is
always
so
attentive
to
them
!
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
's
colour
was
heightened
by
this
unjust
praise
;
and
with
a
smile
,
and
shake
of
the
head
,
which
spoke
much
,
she
looked
at
Mr.
Knightley
.
 
<EOS>
It
seemed
as
if
there
were
an
instantaneous
impression
in
her
favour
,
as
if
his
eyes
received
the
truth
from
hers
,
and
all
that
had
passed
of
good
in
her
feelings
were
at
once
caught
and
honoured
.
  
<EOS>
He
looked
at
her
with
a
glow
of
regard
.
<EOS>
She
was
warmly
gratified
 
and
in
another
moment
still
more
so
,
by
a
little
movement
of
more
than
common
friendliness
on
his
part
.
 
<EOS>
He
took
her
hand
;
 
whether
she
had
not
herself
made
the
first
motion
<EOS>
,
she
could
not
say
 
<EOS>
she
might
,
perhaps
,
have
rather
offered
it
 
<EOS>
but
he
took
her
hand
,
pressed
it
,
and
certainly
was
on
the
point
of
carrying
it
to
his
lips
 
<EOS>
when
,
from
some
fancy
or
other
,
he
suddenly
let
it
go
.
 
<EOS>
Why
he
should
feel
such
a
scruple
,
why
he
should
change
his
mind
when
it
was
all
but
done
,
she
could
not
perceive
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
have
judged
better
,
she
thought
,
if
he
had
not
stopped
.
 
<EOS>
The
intention
,
however
,
was
indubitable
;
and
whether
it
was
that
his
manners
had
in
general
so
little
gallantry
,
or
however
else
it
happened
,
but
she
thought
nothing
became
him
more
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
with
him
,
of
so
simple
,
yet
so
dignified
a
nature
.
 
<EOS>
She
could
not
but
recall
the
attempt
with
great
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
It
spoke
such
perfect
amity
.
 
<EOS>
He
left
them
immediately
afterwards
 
gone
in
a
moment
.
<EOS>
He
always
moved
with
the
alertness
of
a
mind
which
could
neither
be
undecided
nor
dilatory
,
but
now
he
seemed
more
sudden
than
usual
in
his
disappearance
.
  
<EOS>
Emma
could
not
regret
her
having
gone
to
Miss
Bates
,
but
she
wished
she
had
left
her
ten
minutes
earlier
;
 
<EOS>
it
would
have
been
a
great
pleasure
to
talk
over
Jane
Fairfax
's
situation
with
Mr.
Knightley
.
 
<EOS>
Neither
<EOS>
would
she
regret
that
he
should
be
going
to
Brunswick
Square
,
for
she
knew
how
much
his
visit
would
be
enjoyed
 
<EOS>
but
it
might
have
happened
at
a
better
time
 
and
to
have
had
longer
notice
of
it
,
would
have
been
pleasanter
.
 
<EOS>
They
parted
thorough
friends
,
however
;
she
could
not
be
deceived
as
to
the
meaning
of
his
countenance
,
and
his
unfinished
gallantry
;
 
it
was
all
done
to
assure
her
that
she
had
fully
recovered
his
good
opinion
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
been
sitting
with
them
half
an
hour
,
she
found
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
pity
that
she
had
not
come
back
earlier
!
  
<EOS>
In
the
hope
of
diverting
her
father
's
thoughts
from
the
disagreeableness
of
Mr.
Knightley
's
going
to
London
;
and
going
so
suddenly
;
and
going
on
horseback
,
which
she
knew
would
be
all
very
bad
<EOS>
;
Emma
communicated
her
news
of
Jane
Fairfax
,
and
her
dependence
on
the
effect
was
justified
;
it
supplied
a
very
useful
check
,
 
interested
,
without
disturbing
him
.
<EOS>
He
had
long
made
up
his
mind
to
Jane
Fairfax
's
going
out
as
governess
,
and
could
talk
of
it
cheerfully
,
but
Mr.
Knightley
's
going
to
London
had
been
an
unexpected
blow
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
glad
,
indeed
,
my
dear
,
to
hear
she
is
to
be
so
comfortably
settled
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Elton
is
very
good
-
natured
and
agreeable
,
and
I
dare
say
her
acquaintance
are
just
what
they
ought
to
be
.
<EOS>
I
hope
it
is
a
dry
situation
,
and
that
her
health
will
be
taken
good
care
of
.
<EOS>
It
ought
to
be
a
first
object
,
as
I
am
sure
poor
Miss
Taylor
's
always
was
with
me
.
<EOS>
You
know
,
my
dear
,
she
is
going
to
be
to
this
new
lady
what
Miss
Taylor
was
to
us
.
<EOS>
And
I
hope
she
will
be
better
off
in
one
respect
,
and
not
be
induced
to
go
away
after
it
has
been
her
home
so
long
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
following
day
brought
news
from
Richmond
to
throw
every
thing
else
into
the
background
.
<EOS>
An
express
arrived
at
Randalls
to
announce
the
death
of
Mrs.
Churchill
!
<EOS>
Though
her
nephew
had
had
no
particular
reason
to
hasten
back
on
her
account
,
she
had
not
lived
above
six
-
and
-
thirty
hours
after
his
return
.
<EOS>
A
sudden
seizure
of
a
different
nature
from
any
thing
foreboded
by
her
general
state
,
had
carried
her
off
after
a
short
struggle
.
<EOS>
The
great
Mrs.
Churchill
was
no
more
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
felt
as
such
things
must
be
felt
.
<EOS>
Every
body
had
a
degree
of
gravity
and
sorrow
;
tenderness
towards
the
departed
,
solicitude
for
the
surviving
friends
;
and
,
in
a
reasonable
time
,
curiosity
to
know
where
she
would
be
buried
.
<EOS>
Goldsmith
tells
us
,
that
when
lovely
woman
stoops
to
folly
,
she
has
nothing
to
do
but
to
die
;
and
when
she
stoops
to
be
disagreeable
,
it
is
equally
to
be
recommended
as
a
clearer
of
ill
-
fame
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Churchill
,
after
being
disliked
at
least
twenty
-
five
years
,
was
now
spoken
of
with
compassionate
allowances
.
<EOS>
In
one
point
she
was
fully
justified
.
<EOS>
She
had
never
been
admitted
before
to
be
seriously
ill
.
<EOS>
The
event
acquitted
her
of
all
the
fancifulness
,
and
all
the
selfishness
of
imaginary
complaints
.
  
<EOS>
"
Poor
Mrs.
Churchill
!
<EOS>
no
doubt
she
had
been
suffering
a
great
deal
:
<EOS>
more
than
any
body
had
ever
supposed
 
and
continual
pain
would
try
the
temper
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
sad
event
 
a
great
shock
 
with
all
her
faults
,
what
would
Mr.
Churchill
do
without
her
?
<EOS>
Mr.
Churchill
's
loss
would
be
dreadful
indeed
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Churchill
would
never
get
over
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
Even
Mr.
Weston
shook
his
head
,
and
looked
solemn
,
and
said
,
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
poor
woman
,
who
would
have
thought
it
!
"
and
resolved
,
that
his
mourning
should
be
as
handsome
as
possible
;
and
his
wife
sat
sighing
and
moralising
over
her
broad
hems
with
a
commiseration
and
good
sense
,
true
and
steady
.
<EOS>
How
it
would
affect
Frank
was
among
the
earliest
thoughts
of
both
.
<EOS>
It
was
also
a
very
early
speculation
with
Emma
.
<EOS>
The
character
of
Mrs.
Churchill
,
the
grief
of
her
husband
 
<EOS>
her
mind
glanced
over
them
both
with
awe
and
compassion
 
and
then
rested
with
lightened
feelings
on
how
Frank
might
be
affected
by
the
event
,
<EOS>
how
benefited
,
how
freed
.
<EOS>
She
saw
in
a
moment
all
the
possible
good
.
<EOS>
Now
,
an
attachment
to
Harriet
Smith
would
have
nothing
to
encounter
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Churchill
,
independent
of
his
wife
,
was
feared
by
nobody
;
an
easy
,
guidable
man
,
to
be
persuaded
into
any
thing
by
his
nephew
.
<EOS>
All
that
remained
to
be
wished
was
,
that
the
nephew
should
form
the
attachment
,
as
,
with
all
her
goodwill
in
the
cause
<EOS>
,
Emma
could
feel
no
certainty
of
its
being
already
formed
.
  
<EOS>
Harriet
behaved
extremely
well
on
the
occasion
,
with
great
self
-
command
.
<EOS>
What
ever
she
might
feel
of
brighter
hope
,
she
betrayed
nothing
.
<EOS>
Emma
was
gratified
,
to
observe
such
a
proof
in
her
of
strengthened
character
,
and
refrained
from
any
allusion
that
might
endanger
its
maintenance
.
<EOS>
They
spoke
,
therefore
,
of
Mrs.
Churchill
's
death
with
mutual
forbearance
.
  
<EOS>
Short
letters
from
Frank
were
received
at
Randalls
,
communicating
all
that
was
immediately
important
of
their
state
and
plans
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Churchill
was
better
than
could
be
expected
;
and
their
first
removal
,
on
the
departure
of
the
funeral
for
Yorkshire
,
was
to
be
to
the
house
of
a
very
old
friend
in
Windsor
,
to
whom
Mr.
Churchill
had
been
promising
a
visit
the
last
ten
years
.
<EOS>
At
present
,
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
for
Harriet
;
good
wishes
for
the
future
were
all
that
could
yet
be
possible
on
Emma
's
side
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
more
pressing
concern
to
shew
attention
to
Jane
Fairfax
,
whose
prospects
were
closing
,
while
Harriet
's
opened
,
and
whose
engagements
now
allowed
of
no
delay
in
any
one
at
Highbury
,
who
wished
to
shew
her
kindness
 
and
with
Emma
it
was
grown
into
a
first
wish
.
<EOS>
She
had
scarcely
a
stronger
regret
than
for
her
past
coldness
;
and
the
person
,
whom
she
had
been
so
many
months
neglecting
,
was
now
the
very
one
on
whom
she
would
have
lavished
every
distinction
of
regard
or
sympathy
.
<EOS>
She
wanted
to
be
of
use
to
her
;
wanted
to
shew
a
value
for
her
society
,
and
testify
respect
and
consideration
.
<EOS>
She
resolved
to
prevail
on
her
to
spend
a
day
at
Hartfield
.
<EOS>
A
note
was
written
to
urge
it
.
<EOS>
The
invitation
was
refused
,
and
by
a
verbal
message
.
"
<EOS>
Miss
Fairfax
was
not
well
enough
to
write
;
"
and
when
Mr.
Perry
called
at
Hartfield
,
the
same
morning
,
it
appeared
that
she
was
so
much
indisposed
as
to
have
been
visited
,
though
against
her
own
consent
,
by
himself
,
and
that
she
was
suffering
under
severe
headaches
,
and
a
nervous
fever
to
a
degree
,
which
made
him
doubt
the
possibility
of
her
going
to
Mrs.
Smallridge
's
at
the
time
proposed
.
<EOS>
Her
health
seemed
for
the
moment
completely
deranged
 
appetite
quite
gone
 
and
though
there
were
no
absolutely
alarming
symptoms
,
nothing
touching
the
pulmonary
complaint
,
which
was
the
standing
apprehension
of
the
family
,
Mr.
Perry
was
uneasy
about
her
.
<EOS>
He
thought
she
had
undertaken
more
than
she
was
equal
to
,
and
that
she
felt
it
so
herself
,
though
she
would
not
own
it
.
<EOS>
Her
spirits
seemed
overcome
.
<EOS>
Her
present
home
,
he
could
not
but
observe
,
was
unfavourable
to
a
nervous
disorder
:
 
confined
always
to
one
room
;
 
he
could
have
wished
it
otherwise
 
and
her
good
aunt
,
though
his
very
old
friend
,
he
must
acknowledge
to
be
not
the
best
companion
for
an
invalid
of
that
description
.
<EOS>
Her
care
and
attention
could
not
be
questioned
;
they
were
,
in
fact
,
only
too
great
.
<EOS>
He
very
much
feared
that
Miss
Fairfax
derived
more
evil
than
good
from
them
.
<EOS>
Emma
listened
with
the
warmest
concern
;
grieved
for
her
more
and
more
,
and
looked
around
eager
to
discover
some
way
of
being
useful
.
<EOS>
To
take
her
 
be
it
only
an
hour
or
two
 
from
her
aunt
,
to
give
her
change
of
air
and
scene
,
and
quiet
rational
conversation
,
even
for
an
hour
or
two
,
might
do
her
good
;
and
the
following
morning
she
wrote
again
to
say
,
in
the
most
feeling
language
she
could
command
,
that
she
would
call
for
her
in
the
carriage
at
any
hour
that
Jane
would
name
 
mentioning
that
she
had
Mr.
Perry
's
decided
opinion
,
in
favour
of
such
exercise
for
his
patient
.
<EOS>
The
answer
was
only
in
this
short
note
:
  
"
Miss
Fairfax
's
compliments
and
thanks
,
but
is
quite
unequal
to
any
exercise
.
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
felt
that
her
own
note
had
deserved
something
better
;
but
it
was
impossible
to
quarrel
with
words
,
whose
tremulous
inequality
shewed
indisposition
so
plainly
,
and
she
thought
only
of
how
she
might
best
counteract
this
unwillingness
to
be
seen
or
assisted
.
<EOS>
In
spite
of
the
answer
,
therefore
,
she
ordered
the
carriage
,
and
drove
to
Mrs.
Bates
's
,
in
the
hope
that
Jane
would
be
induced
to
join
her
 
<EOS>
but
it
would
not
do
;
 
Miss
Bates
came
to
the
carriage
door
,
all
gratitude
,
and
agreeing
with
her
most
earnestly
in
thinking
an
airing
might
be
of
the
greatest
service
 
and
every
thing
that
message
could
do
was
tried
 
but
all
in
vain
.
<EOS>
Miss
Bates
was
obliged
to
return
without
success
;
Jane
was
quite
unpersuadable
;
the
mere
proposal
of
going
out
seemed
to
make
her
worse
.
 
<EOS>
Emma
wished
she
could
have
seen
her
,
and
tried
her
own
powers
;
but
,
almost
before
she
could
hint
the
wish
,
Miss
Bates
made
it
appear
that
she
had
promised
her
niece
on
no
account
to
let
Miss
Woodhouse
in
.
"
<EOS>
Indeed
,
the
truth
was
,
that
poor
dear
Jane
could
not
bear
to
see
any
body
 
any
body
at
all
 
Mrs.
Elton
,
indeed
,
could
not
be
denied
 
and
Mrs.
Cole
had
made
such
a
point
 
and
Mrs.
Perry
had
said
so
much
 
but
,
except
them
,
Jane
would
really
see
nobody
.
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
did
not
want
to
be
classed
with
the
Mrs.
Eltons
,
the
Mrs.
Perrys
,
and
the
Mrs.
Coles
,
who
would
force
themselves
anywhere
;
neither
could
she
feel
any
right
of
preference
<EOS>
herself
 
<EOS>
she
submitted
,
therefore
,
and
only
questioned
Miss
Bates
farther
as
to
her
niece
's
appetite
and
diet
,
which
she
longed
to
be
able
to
assist
.
<EOS>
On
that
subject
poor
Miss
Bates
was
very
unhappy
,
and
very
communicative
;
Jane
would
hardly
eat
any
thing
:
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Perry
recommended
nourishing
food
;
but
every
thing
they
could
command
(
and
never
had
any
body
such
good
neighbours
)
was
distasteful
.
  
<EOS>
Emma
,
on
reaching
home
,
called
the
housekeeper
directly
,
to
an
examination
of
her
stores
;
and
some
arrowroot
of
very
superior
quality
was
speedily
despatched
to
Miss
Bates
with
a
most
friendly
note
.
<EOS>
In
half
an
hour
the
arrowroot
was
returned
,
with
a
thousand
thanks
from
Miss
Bates
,
but
"
dear
Jane
would
not
be
satisfied
without
its
being
sent
back
;
it
was
a
thing
she
could
not
take
 
<EOS>
and
,
moreover
,
she
insisted
on
her
saying
,
that
she
was
not
at
all
in
want
of
any
thing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
When
Emma
afterwards
heard
that
Jane
Fairfax
had
been
seen
wandering
about
the
meadows
,
at
some
distance
from
Highbury
,
on
the
afternoon
of
the
very
day
on
which
she
had
,
under
the
plea
of
being
unequal
to
any
exercise
,
so
peremptorily
refused
to
go
out
with
her
in
the
carriage
,
she
could
have
no
doubt
 
putting
every
thing
together
 
that
Jane
was
resolved
to
receive
no
kindness
from
_
her
_
.
<EOS>
She
was
sorry
,
very
sorry
.
<EOS>
Her
heart
was
grieved
for
a
state
which
seemed
but
the
more
pitiable
from
this
sort
of
irritation
of
spirits
,
inconsistency
of
action
,
and
inequality
of
powers
;
and
it
mortified
her
that
she
was
given
so
little
credit
for
proper
feeling
,
or
esteemed
so
little
worthy
as
a
friend
:
but
she
had
the
consolation
of
knowing
that
her
intentions
were
good
,
and
of
being
able
to
say
to
herself
,
that
could
Mr.
Knightley
have
been
privy
to
all
her
attempts
of
assisting
Jane
Fairfax
<EOS>
,
could
he
even
have
seen
into
her
heart
,
he
would
not
,
on
this
occasion
,
have
found
any
thing
to
reprove
.
    
<EOS>
One
morning
,
about
ten
days
after
Mrs.
Churchill
's
decease
,
Emma
was
called
downstairs
to
Mr.
Weston
,
who
"
could
not
stay
five
minutes
,
and
wanted
particularly
to
speak
with
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
met
her
at
the
parlour
-
door
,
and
hardly
asking
her
how
she
did
,
in
the
natural
key
of
his
voice
,
sunk
it
immediately
,
to
say
,
unheard
by
her
father
,
  
<EOS>
"
Can
you
come
to
Randalls
at
any
time
this
morning
?
 
<EOS>
Do
,
if
it
be
possible
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Weston
wants
to
see
you
.
<EOS>
She
must
see
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
she
unwell
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
not
at
all
 
only
a
little
agitated
.
<EOS>
She
would
have
ordered
the
carriage
,
and
come
to
you
,
but
she
must
see
you
_
alone
_
,
and
that
you
know
 
<EOS>
(
nodding
towards
her
father
)
 
Humph
!
 
<EOS>
Can
you
come
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Certainly
.
<EOS>
This
moment
,
if
you
please
.
<EOS>
It
is
impossible
to
refuse
what
you
ask
in
such
a
way
.
<EOS>
But
what
can
be
the
matter
?
 
<EOS>
Is
she
really
not
ill
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Depend
upon
me
 
but
ask
no
more
questions
.
<EOS>
You
will
know
it
all
in
time
.
<EOS>
The
most
unaccountable
business
!
<EOS>
But
hush
,
hush
!
"
  
<EOS>
To
guess
what
all
this
meant
,
was
impossible
even
for
Emma
.
<EOS>
Something
really
important
seemed
announced
by
his
looks
;
but
,
as
her
friend
was
well
,
she
endeavoured
not
to
be
uneasy
,
and
settling
it
with
her
father
,
that
she
would
take
her
walk
now
,
she
and
Mr.
Weston
were
soon
out
of
the
house
together
and
on
their
way
at
a
quick
pace
for
Randalls
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
"
 
said
Emma
,
when
they
were
fairly
beyond
the
sweep
gates
,
 
"
now
Mr.
Weston
,
do
let
me
know
what
has
happened
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
"
 
he
gravely
replied
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
ask
me
.
<EOS>
I
promised
my
wife
to
leave
it
all
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
will
break
it
to
you
better
than
I
can
.
<EOS>
Do
not
be
impatient
,
Emma
;
it
will
all
come
out
too
soon
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Break
it
to
me
,
"
cried
Emma
,
standing
still
with
terror
.
 
<EOS>
"
Good
God
!
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Weston
,
tell
me
at
once
.
 
<EOS>
Something
has
happened
in
Brunswick
Square
.
<EOS>
I
know
it
has
.
<EOS>
Tell
me
,
I
charge
you
tell
me
this
moment
what
it
is
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
indeed
you
are
mistaken
.
"
    
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Weston
do
not
trifle
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
Consider
how
many
of
my
dearest
friends
are
now
in
Brunswick
Square
.
<EOS>
Which
of
them
is
it
?
 
<EOS>
I
charge
you
by
all
that
is
sacred
,
not
to
attempt
concealment
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Upon
my
word
,
Emma
.
"
    
"
Your
word
!
 
<EOS>
why
not
your
honour
!
 
<EOS>
why
not
say
upon
your
honour
,
that
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
any
of
them
?
<EOS>
Good
Heavens
!
 
<EOS>
What
can
be
to
be
_
broke
_
to
me
<EOS>
,
that
does
not
relate
to
one
of
that
family
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
honour
,
"
said
he
very
seriously
,
"
it
does
not
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
in
the
smallest
degree
connected
with
any
human
being
of
the
name
of
Knightley
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
's
courage
returned
,
and
she
walked
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
wrong
,
"
he
continued
,
"
in
talking
of
its
being
<EOS>
_
broke
_
to
you
.
<EOS>
I
should
not
have
used
the
expression
.
<EOS>
In
fact
,
it
does
not
concern
you
 
<EOS>
it
concerns
only
myself
,
 
<EOS>
that
is
,
we
hope
.
 
<EOS>
Humph
!
 
<EOS>
In
short
,
my
dear
Emma
,
there
is
no
occasion
to
be
so
uneasy
about
it
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
say
that
it
is
not
a
disagreeable
business
 
<EOS>
but
things
might
be
much
worse
.
 
<EOS>
If
we
walk
fast
,
we
shall
soon
be
at
Randalls
.
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
found
that
she
must
wait
;
and
now
it
required
little
effort
.
<EOS>
She
asked
no
more
questions
therefore
,
merely
employed
her
own
fancy
,
and
that
soon
pointed
out
to
her
the
probability
of
its
being
some
money
concern
 
<EOS>
something
just
come
to
light
,
of
a
disagreeable
nature
in
the
circumstances
of
the
family
,
 
something
which
the
late
event
at
Richmond
had
brought
forward
.
<EOS>
Her
fancy
was
very
active
.
<EOS>
Half
a
dozen
natural
children
,
perhaps
 
and
poor
Frank
cut
off
!
 
<EOS>
This
,
though
very
undesirable
,
would
be
no
matter
of
agony
to
her
.
<EOS>
It
inspired
little
more
than
an
animating
curiosity
.
  
<EOS>
"
Who
is
that
gentleman
on
horseback
?
"
<EOS>
said
she
,
as
they
proceeded
 
speaking
more
to
assist
Mr.
Weston
in
keeping
his
secret
,
than
with
any
other
view
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
.
 
<EOS>
One
of
the
Otways
.
 
<EOS>
Not
Frank
;
 
<EOS>
it
is
not
Frank
,
I
assure
you
.
<EOS>
You
will
not
see
him
.
<EOS>
He
is
half
way
to
Windsor
by
this
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Has
your
son
been
with
you
,
then
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
yes
 
did
not
you
know
?
 
<EOS>
Well
,
well
,
never
mind
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
For
a
moment
he
was
silent
;
and
then
added
,
in
a
tone
much
more
guarded
and
demure
,
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
Frank
came
over
this
morning
,
just
to
ask
us
how
we
did
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
They
hurried
on
,
and
were
speedily
at
Randalls
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
my
dear
,
"
said
he
,
as
they
entered
the
room
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
brought
her
,
and
now
I
hope
you
will
soon
be
better
.
<EOS>
I
shall
leave
you
together
.
<EOS>
There
is
no
use
in
delay
.
<EOS>
I
shall
not
be
far
off
,
if
you
want
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
Emma
distinctly
heard
him
add
,
in
a
lower
tone
,
before
he
quitted
the
room
,
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
as
good
as
my
word
.
<EOS>
She
has
not
the
least
idea
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Weston
was
looking
so
ill
,
and
had
an
air
of
so
much
perturbation
,
that
Emma
's
uneasiness
increased
;
and
<EOS>
the
moment
they
were
alone
,
she
eagerly
said
,
  
"
What
is
it
my
dear
friend
?
<EOS>
Something
of
a
very
unpleasant
nature
,
I
find
,
has
occurred
;
 
do
let
me
know
directly
what
it
is
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
walking
all
this
way
in
complete
suspense
.
<EOS>
We
both
abhor
suspense
.
<EOS>
Do
not
let
mine
continue
longer
.
<EOS>
It
will
do
you
good
to
speak
of
your
distress
,
whatever
it
may
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Have
you
indeed
no
idea
?
"
said
Mrs.
Weston
in
a
trembling
voice
.
"
<EOS>
Can
not
you
,
<EOS>
my
dear
Emma
 
can
not
you
form
a
guess
as
to
what
you
are
to
hear
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
So
far
as
that
it
relates
to
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
,
I
do
guess
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
right
.
<EOS>
It
does
relate
to
him
,
and
I
will
tell
you
directly
;
"
(
resuming
her
work
,
and
seeming
resolved
against
looking
up
.
)
<EOS>
"
He
has
been
here
this
very
morning
,
on
a
most
extraordinary
errand
.
<EOS>
It
is
impossible
to
express
our
surprize
.
<EOS>
He
came
to
speak
to
his
father
on
a
subject
,
 
to
announce
an
attachment
 
<EOS>
"
  
She
stopped
to
breathe
.
<EOS>
Emma
thought
first
of
herself
,
and
then
of
Harriet
.
  
<EOS>
"
More
than
an
attachment
,
indeed
,
"
resumed
Mrs.
Weston
;
"
an
engagement
 
a
positive
engagement
.
 
<EOS>
What
will
you
say
,
Emma
 
what
will
any
body
say
,
when
it
is
known
that
Frank
Churchill
and
Miss
Fairfax
are
engaged
;
 
nay
,
that
they
have
been
long
engaged
!
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
even
jumped
with
surprize
;
 
and
,
horror
-
struck
,
exclaimed
,
  
"
<EOS>
Jane
Fairfax
!
 
<EOS>
Good
God
!
<EOS>
You
are
not
serious
?
<EOS>
You
do
not
mean
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
may
well
be
amazed
,
"
returned
Mrs.
Weston
,
still
averting
her
eyes
,
and
talking
on
with
eagerness
,
that
Emma
might
have
time
to
recover
  
<EOS>
"
You
may
well
be
amazed
.
<EOS>
But
it
is
even
so
.
<EOS>
There
has
been
a
solemn
engagement
between
them
ever
since
October
 
formed
at
Weymouth
,
and
kept
a
secret
from
every
body
.
<EOS>
Not
a
creature
knowing
it
<EOS>
but
themselves
 
<EOS>
neither
the
Campbells
,
nor
her
family
,
nor
his
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
so
wonderful
,
that
though
perfectly
convinced
of
the
fact
,
it
is
yet
almost
incredible
to
myself
.
<EOS>
I
can
hardly
believe
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
thought
I
knew
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
scarcely
heard
what
was
said
.
 
<EOS>
Her
mind
was
divided
between
two
ideas
 
her
own
former
conversations
with
him
about
Miss
Fairfax
;
and
poor
Harriet
;
 
and
for
some
time
she
could
only
exclaim
,
and
require
confirmation
,
repeated
confirmation
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
said
she
at
last
,
trying
to
recover
herself
;
"
this
is
a
circumstance
which
I
must
think
of
at
least
half
a
day
,
before
I
can
at
all
comprehend
it
.
<EOS>
What
!
 
<EOS>
engaged
to
her
all
the
winter
 
before
either
of
them
came
to
Highbury
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Engaged
since
October
,
 
secretly
engaged
.
 
<EOS>
It
has
hurt
me
,
Emma
,
very
much
.
<EOS>
It
has
hurt
his
father
equally
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
Some
_
_
part
_
of
his
conduct
we
can
not
excuse
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
pondered
a
moment
,
and
then
replied
,
"
I
will
not
pretend
_
not
_
to
understand
you
;
and
to
give
you
all
the
relief
in
my
power
,
be
assured
that
no
such
effect
has
followed
his
attentions
to
me
,
as
you
are
apprehensive
of
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Weston
looked
up
,
afraid
to
believe
;
but
Emma
's
countenance
was
as
steady
as
her
words
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
you
may
have
less
difficulty
in
believing
this
boast
,
of
my
present
perfect
indifference
,
"
she
continued
,
"
I
will
farther
tell
you
,
that
there
was
a
period
in
the
early
part
of
our
acquaintance
,
when
I
did
like
him
,
when
I
was
very
much
disposed
to
be
attached
to
him
 
<EOS>
nay
,
was
attached
 
and
<EOS>
how
it
came
to
cease
,
is
perhaps
the
wonder
.
<EOS>
Fortunately
,
however
,
it
did
cease
.
<EOS>
I
have
really
for
some
time
past
,
for
at
least
these
three
months
,
cared
nothing
about
him
.
<EOS>
You
may
believe
me
,
Mrs.
Weston
.
<EOS>
This
is
the
simple
truth
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Weston
kissed
her
with
tears
of
joy
;
and
when
she
could
find
utterance
,
assured
her
,
that
this
protestation
had
done
her
more
good
than
any
thing
else
in
the
world
could
do
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Weston
will
be
almost
as
much
relieved
as
myself
,
"
said
she
.
<EOS>
"
On
this
point
we
have
been
wretched
.
<EOS>
It
was
our
darling
wish
that
you
might
be
attached
to
each
other
 
and
we
were
persuaded
that
it
was
so
.
  
<EOS>
Imagine
what
we
have
been
feeling
on
your
account
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
escaped
;
and
that
I
should
escape
,
may
be
a
matter
of
grateful
wonder
to
you
and
myself
.
<EOS>
But
this
does
not
acquit
_
him
_
,
Mrs.
Weston
;
and
I
must
say
,
that
I
think
him
greatly
to
blame
.
<EOS>
What
right
had
he
to
come
among
us
with
affection
and
faith
engaged
,
and
with
manners
<EOS>
so
_
very
_
disengaged
?
<EOS>
What
right
had
he
to
endeavour
to
please
,
as
he
certainly
did
 
to
distinguish
any
one
young
woman
with
persevering
attention
,
as
he
certainly
did
 
while
he
really
belonged
to
another
?
 
<EOS>
How
could
he
tell
what
mischief
he
might
be
doing
?
 
<EOS>
How
could
he
tell
that
he
might
not
be
making
me
in
love
with
him
?
 
<EOS>
very
wrong
,
very
wrong
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
From
something
that
he
said
,
my
dear
Emma
,
I
rather
imagine
 
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
how
could
_
she
<EOS>
_
bear
such
behaviour
!
<EOS>
Composure
with
a
witness
!
<EOS>
to
look
on
,
while
repeated
attentions
were
offering
to
another
woman
,
before
her
face
,
and
not
resent
it
.
 
<EOS>
That
is
a
degree
of
placidity
,
which
I
can
neither
comprehend
nor
respect
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
were
misunderstandings
between
them
,
Emma
;
he
said
so
expressly
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
time
to
enter
into
much
explanation
.
<EOS>
He
was
here
only
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
and
in
a
state
of
agitation
which
did
not
allow
the
full
use
even
of
the
time
he
could
stay
 
but
that
there
had
been
misunderstandings
he
decidedly
said
.
<EOS>
The
present
crisis
,
indeed
,
seemed
to
be
brought
on
by
them
;
and
those
misunderstandings
might
very
possibly
arise
from
the
impropriety
of
his
conduct
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Impropriety
!
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
Mrs.
Weston
 
<EOS>
it
is
too
calm
a
censure
.
<EOS>
Much
,
much
beyond
impropriety
!
 
<EOS>
It
has
sunk
him
<EOS>
,
I
can
not
say
how
it
has
sunk
him
in
my
opinion
.
<EOS>
So
unlike
what
a
man
should
be
!
 
<EOS>
None
of
that
upright
integrity
,
that
strict
adherence
to
truth
and
principle
,
that
disdain
of
trick
and
littleness
,
which
a
man
should
display
in
every
transaction
of
his
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
dear
Emma
,
now
I
must
take
his
part
;
for
though
he
has
been
wrong
in
this
instance
,
I
have
known
him
long
enough
to
answer
for
his
having
many
,
very
many
,
good
qualities
;
and
 
"
  
"
Good
God
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Emma
,
not
attending
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Smallridge
,
too
!
<EOS>
Jane
actually
on
the
point
of
going
as
governess
!
<EOS>
What
could
he
mean
by
such
horrible
indelicacy
?
<EOS>
To
suffer
her
to
engage
herself
 
to
suffer
her
even
to
think
of
such
a
measure
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
knew
nothing
about
it
,
Emma
.
<EOS>
On
this
article
I
can
fully
acquit
him
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
private
resolution
of
hers
,
not
communicated
to
him
 
or
at
least
not
communicated
in
a
way
to
carry
conviction
.
 
<EOS>
Till
yesterday
,
I
know
he
said
he
was
in
the
dark
as
to
her
plans
.
<EOS>
They
burst
on
him
,
I
do
not
know
how
,
but
by
some
letter
or
message
 
<EOS>
and
it
was
the
discovery
of
what
she
was
doing
,
of
this
very
project
of
hers
,
which
determined
him
to
come
forward
at
once
,
own
it
all
to
his
uncle
,
throw
himself
on
his
kindness
,
and
,
in
short
,
put
an
end
to
the
miserable
state
of
concealment
that
had
been
carrying
on
so
long
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
began
to
listen
better
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
to
hear
from
him
soon
,
"
continued
Mrs.
Weston
.
"
<EOS>
He
told
me
at
parting
,
that
he
should
soon
write
;
and
he
spoke
in
a
manner
which
seemed
to
promise
me
many
particulars
that
could
not
be
given
now
.
<EOS>
Let
us
wait
,
therefore
,
for
this
letter
.
<EOS>
It
may
bring
many
extenuations
.
<EOS>
It
may
make
many
things
intelligible
and
excusable
which
now
are
not
to
be
understood
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
let
us
be
severe
,
do
n't
let
us
be
in
a
hurry
to
condemn
him
.
<EOS>
Let
us
have
patience
.
<EOS>
I
must
love
him
;
and
now
that
I
am
satisfied
on
one
point
,
the
one
material
point
,
I
am
sincerely
anxious
for
its
all
turning
out
well
,
and
ready
to
hope
that
it
may
.
<EOS>
They
must
both
have
suffered
a
great
deal
under
such
a
system
of
secresy
and
concealment
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
_
His
_
sufferings
,
"
replied
Emma
dryly
,
"
do
not
appear
to
have
done
him
much
harm
.
<EOS>
Well
,
and
how
did
Mr.
Churchill
take
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Most
favourably
for
his
nephew
 
gave
his
consent
with
scarcely
a
difficulty
.
<EOS>
Conceive
what
the
events
of
a
week
have
done
in
that
family
!
<EOS>
While
poor
Mrs.
Churchill
lived
,
I
suppose
there
could
not
have
been
a
hope
,
a
chance
,
a
possibility
;
 
but
scarcely
are
her
remains
at
rest
in
the
family
vault
,
than
her
husband
is
persuaded
to
act
exactly
opposite
to
what
she
would
have
required
.
<EOS>
What
a
blessing
it
is
,
when
undue
influence
does
not
survive
the
grave
!
 
<EOS>
He
gave
his
consent
with
very
little
persuasion
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Ah
!
"
thought
Emma
,
"
he
would
have
done
as
much
for
Harriet
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
This
was
settled
last
night
,
and
Frank
was
off
with
the
light
this
morning
.
<EOS>
He
stopped
at
Highbury
,
at
the
Bates
's
,
I
fancy
,
some
time
 
<EOS>
and
then
came
on
hither
;
but
was
in
such
a
hurry
to
get
back
to
his
uncle
,
to
whom
he
is
just
now
more
necessary
than
ever
,
that
,
as
I
tell
you
,
he
could
stay
with
us
but
a
quarter
of
an
hour
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
very
much
agitated
 
very
much
,
indeed
 
to
a
degree
that
made
him
appear
quite
a
different
creature
from
any
thing
I
had
ever
seen
him
before
.
 
<EOS>
In
addition
to
all
the
rest
,
there
had
been
the
shock
of
finding
her
so
very
unwell
,
which
he
had
had
no
previous
suspicion
of
 
and
there
was
every
appearance
of
his
having
been
feeling
a
great
deal
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
do
you
really
believe
the
affair
to
have
been
carrying
on
with
such
perfect
secresy
?
 
<EOS>
The
Campbells
,
the
Dixons
,
did
none
of
them
know
of
the
engagement
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
could
not
speak
the
name
of
Dixon
without
a
little
blush
.
  
<EOS>
"
None
;
not
one
.
<EOS>
He
positively
said
that
it
had
been
known
to
no
being
in
the
world
but
their
two
selves
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
said
Emma
,
"
I
suppose
we
shall
gradually
grow
reconciled
to
the
idea
,
and
I
wish
them
very
happy
.
<EOS>
But
I
shall
always
think
it
a
very
abominable
sort
of
proceeding
.
<EOS>
What
has
it
been
but
a
system
of
hypocrisy
and
deceit
,
 
espionage
,
and
treachery
?
 
<EOS>
To
come
among
us
with
professions
of
openness
and
simplicity
;
and
such
a
league
in
secret
to
judge
us
all
!
 
<EOS>
Here
have
we
been
,
the
whole
winter
and
spring
,
completely
duped
,
fancying
ourselves
all
on
an
equal
footing
of
truth
and
honour
,
with
two
people
in
the
midst
of
us
who
may
have
been
carrying
round
,
comparing
and
sitting
in
judgment
on
sentiments
and
words
that
were
never
meant
for
both
to
hear
.
 
<EOS>
They
must
take
the
consequence
,
if
they
have
heard
each
other
spoken
of
in
a
way
not
perfectly
agreeable
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
quite
easy
on
that
head
,
"
replied
Mrs.
Weston
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
sure
that
I
never
said
any
thing
of
either
to
the
other
,
which
both
might
not
have
heard
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
in
luck
.
 
<EOS>
Your
only
blunder
was
confined
to
my
ear
,
when
you
imagined
a
certain
friend
of
ours
in
love
with
the
lady
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
True
.
<EOS>
But
as
I
have
always
had
a
thoroughly
good
opinion
of
Miss
Fairfax
,
I
never
could
,
under
any
blunder
,
have
spoken
ill
of
her
;
and
as
to
speaking
ill
of
him
,
there
I
must
have
been
safe
.
"
  
<EOS>
At
this
moment
Mr.
Weston
appeared
at
a
little
distance
from
the
window
,
evidently
on
the
watch
.
<EOS>
His
wife
gave
him
a
look
which
invited
him
in
;
and
,
while
he
was
coming
round
,
added
,
"
<EOS>
Now
,
dearest
Emma
,
let
me
intreat
you
to
say
and
look
every
thing
that
may
set
his
heart
at
ease
,
and
incline
him
to
be
satisfied
with
the
match
.
<EOS>
Let
us
make
the
best
of
it
 
and
,
indeed
,
almost
every
thing
may
be
fairly
said
in
her
favour
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
a
connexion
to
gratify
;
but
if
Mr.
Churchill
does
not
feel
that
,
why
should
we
?
<EOS>
and
it
may
be
a
very
fortunate
circumstance
for
him
,
for
Frank
,
I
mean
,
that
he
should
have
attached
himself
to
a
girl
of
such
steadiness
of
character
and
good
judgment
as
I
have
always
given
her
credit
for
 
and
still
am
disposed
to
give
her
credit
for
,
in
spite
of
this
one
great
deviation
from
the
strict
rule
of
right
.
<EOS>
And
how
much
may
be
said
in
her
situation
for
even
that
error
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Much
,
indeed
!
"
cried
Emma
feelingly
.
<EOS>
"
If
a
woman
can
ever
be
excused
for
thinking
only
of
herself
,
it
is
in
a
situation
like
Jane
Fairfax
's
.
 
<EOS>
Of
such
,
one
may
almost
say
,
that
"
the
world
is
not
their
's
,
nor
the
world
's
law
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
She
met
Mr.
Weston
on
his
entrance
,
with
a
smiling
countenance
,
exclaiming
,
  
"
A
very
pretty
trick
you
have
been
playing
me
,
upon
my
word
!
<EOS>
This
was
a
device
,
I
suppose
,
to
sport
with
my
curiosity
,
and
exercise
my
talent
of
guessing
.
<EOS>
But
you
really
frightened
me
.
<EOS>
I
thought
you
had
lost
half
your
property
,
at
least
.
<EOS>
And
here
,
instead
of
its
being
a
matter
of
condolence
,
it
turns
out
to
be
one
of
congratulation
.
 
<EOS>
I
congratulate
you
,
Mr.
Weston
,
with
all
my
heart
,
on
the
prospect
of
having
one
of
the
most
lovely
and
accomplished
young
women
in
England
for
your
daughter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
A
glance
or
two
between
him
and
his
wife
,
convinced
him
that
all
was
as
right
as
this
speech
proclaimed
;
and
its
happy
effect
on
his
spirits
was
immediate
.
<EOS>
His
air
and
voice
recovered
their
usual
briskness
:
he
shook
her
heartily
and
gratefully
by
the
hand
,
and
entered
on
the
subject
in
a
manner
to
prove
,
that
he
now
only
wanted
time
and
persuasion
to
think
the
engagement
no
very
bad
thing
.
<EOS>
His
companions
suggested
only
what
could
palliate
imprudence
,
or
smooth
objections
;
and
by
the
time
they
had
talked
it
all
over
together
,
and
he
had
talked
it
all
over
again
with
Emma
,
in
their
walk
back
to
Hartfield
,
he
was
become
perfectly
reconciled
,
and
not
far
from
thinking
it
the
very
best
thing
that
Frank
could
possibly
have
done
.
    
<EOS>
"
Harriet
,
poor
Harriet
!
"
 
<EOS>
Those
were
the
words
;
in
them
lay
the
tormenting
ideas
which
Emma
could
not
get
rid
of
,
and
which
constituted
the
real
misery
of
the
business
to
her
.
<EOS>
Frank
Churchill
had
behaved
very
ill
by
herself
 
very
ill
in
many
ways
,
 
but
it
was
not
so
much
_
<EOS>
his
_
behaviour
as
her
<EOS>
_
own
_
,
which
made
her
so
angry
with
him
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
scrape
which
he
had
drawn
her
into
on
Harriet
's
account
,
that
gave
the
deepest
hue
to
his
offence
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
Harriet
!
<EOS>
to
be
a
second
time
the
dupe
of
her
misconceptions
and
flattery
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Knightley
had
spoken
prophetically
,
when
he
once
said
,
"
Emma
,
you
have
been
no
friend
to
Harriet
Smith
.
"
 
<EOS>
She
was
afraid
she
had
done
her
nothing
but
disservice
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
true
that
she
had
not
to
charge
herself
,
in
this
instance
as
in
the
former
,
with
being
the
sole
and
original
author
of
the
mischief
;
with
having
suggested
such
feelings
as
might
otherwise
never
have
entered
Harriet
's
imagination
;
for
Harriet
had
acknowledged
her
admiration
and
preference
of
Frank
Churchill
before
she
had
ever
given
her
a
hint
on
the
subject
;
but
she
felt
completely
guilty
of
having
encouraged
what
she
might
have
repressed
.
<EOS>
She
might
have
prevented
the
indulgence
and
increase
of
such
sentiments
.
<EOS>
Her
influence
would
have
been
enough
.
<EOS>
And
now
she
was
very
conscious
that
she
ought
to
have
prevented
them
.
 
<EOS>
She
felt
that
she
had
been
risking
her
friend
's
happiness
on
most
insufficient
grounds
.
<EOS>
Common
sense
would
have
directed
her
to
tell
Harriet
,
that
she
must
not
allow
herself
to
think
of
him
,
and
that
there
were
five
hundred
chances
to
one
against
his
ever
caring
for
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
,
with
common
sense
,
"
she
added
,
"
I
am
afraid
I
have
had
little
to
do
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
was
extremely
angry
with
herself
.
<EOS>
If
she
could
not
have
been
angry
with
Frank
Churchill
too
,
it
would
have
been
dreadful
.
 
<EOS>
As
for
Jane
Fairfax
,
she
might
at
least
relieve
her
feelings
from
any
present
solicitude
on
her
account
.
<EOS>
Harriet
would
be
anxiety
enough
;
she
need
no
longer
be
unhappy
about
Jane
,
whose
troubles
and
whose
ill
-
health
having
,
of
course
,
the
same
origin
,
must
be
equally
under
cure
.
 
<EOS>
Her
days
of
insignificance
and
evil
were
over
.
 
<EOS>
She
would
soon
be
well
,
and
happy
,
and
prosperous
.
 
<EOS>
Emma
could
now
imagine
why
her
own
attentions
had
been
slighted
.
<EOS>
This
discovery
laid
many
smaller
matters
open
.
<EOS>
No
doubt
it
had
been
from
jealousy
.
 
<EOS>
In
Jane
's
eyes
she
had
been
a
rival
;
and
well
might
any
thing
she
could
offer
of
assistance
or
regard
be
repulsed
.
<EOS>
An
airing
in
the
Hartfield
carriage
would
have
been
the
rack
,
and
arrowroot
from
the
Hartfield
storeroom
must
have
been
poison
.
<EOS>
She
understood
it
all
;
and
as
far
as
her
mind
could
disengage
itself
from
the
injustice
and
selfishness
of
angry
feelings
,
she
acknowledged
that
Jane
Fairfax
would
have
neither
elevation
nor
happiness
beyond
her
desert
.
<EOS>
But
poor
Harriet
was
such
an
engrossing
charge
!
<EOS>
There
was
little
sympathy
to
be
spared
for
any
body
else
.
<EOS>
Emma
was
sadly
fearful
that
this
second
disappointment
would
be
more
severe
than
the
first
.
<EOS>
Considering
the
very
superior
claims
of
the
object
,
it
ought
;
and
judging
by
its
apparently
stronger
effect
on
Harriet
's
mind
,
producing
reserve
and
self
-
command
,
it
would
.
 
<EOS>
She
must
communicate
the
painful
truth
,
however
,
and
as
soon
as
possible
.
<EOS>
An
injunction
of
secresy
had
been
among
Mr.
Weston
's
parting
words
.
<EOS>
"
For
the
present
,
the
whole
affair
was
to
be
completely
a
secret
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Churchill
had
made
a
point
of
it
,
as
a
token
of
respect
to
the
wife
he
had
so
very
recently
lost
;
and
every
body
admitted
it
to
be
no
more
than
due
decorum
.
"
 
<EOS>
Emma
had
promised
;
but
still
Harriet
must
be
excepted
.
<EOS>
It
was
her
superior
duty
.
  
<EOS>
In
spite
of
her
vexation
,
she
could
not
help
feeling
it
almost
ridiculous
,
that
she
should
have
the
very
same
distressing
and
delicate
office
to
perform
by
Harriet
,
which
Mrs.
Weston
had
just
gone
through
by
herself
.
<EOS>
The
intelligence
,
which
had
been
so
anxiously
announced
to
her
,
she
was
now
to
be
anxiously
announcing
to
another
.
<EOS>
Her
heart
beat
quick
on
hearing
Harriet
's
footstep
and
voice
;
so
,
she
supposed
,
had
poor
Mrs.
Weston
felt
when
_
she
_
was
approaching
Randalls
.
<EOS>
Could
the
event
of
the
disclosure
bear
an
equal
resemblance
!
 
<EOS>
But
of
that
,
unfortunately
,
there
could
be
no
chance
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Miss
Woodhouse
!
<EOS>
"
cried
Harriet
,
coming
eagerly
into
the
room
 
"
is
not
this
the
oddest
news
that
ever
was
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
news
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
"
replied
Emma
,
unable
to
guess
,
by
look
or
voice
,
whether
Harriet
could
indeed
have
received
any
hint
.
  
<EOS>
"
About
Jane
Fairfax
.
<EOS>
Did
you
ever
hear
any
thing
so
strange
?
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
<EOS>
you
need
not
be
afraid
of
owning
it
to
me
,
for
Mr.
Weston
has
told
me
himself
.
<EOS>
I
met
him
just
now
.
<EOS>
He
told
me
it
was
to
be
a
great
secret
;
and
,
therefore
,
I
should
not
think
of
mentioning
it
to
any
body
but
you
,
but
he
said
you
knew
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
did
Mr.
Weston
tell
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
said
Emma
,
still
perplexed
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
he
told
me
all
about
it
;
that
Jane
Fairfax
and
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
are
to
be
married
,
and
that
they
have
been
privately
engaged
to
one
another
this
long
while
.
<EOS>
How
very
odd
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
,
indeed
,
so
odd
;
Harriet
's
behaviour
was
so
extremely
odd
,
that
Emma
did
not
know
how
to
understand
it
.
<EOS>
Her
character
appeared
absolutely
changed
.
<EOS>
She
seemed
to
propose
shewing
no
agitation
,
or
disappointment
,
or
peculiar
concern
in
the
discovery
.
<EOS>
Emma
looked
at
her
,
quite
unable
to
speak
.
  
<EOS>
"
Had
you
any
idea
,
"
cried
Harriet
,
"
of
his
being
in
love
with
her
?
 
<EOS>
You
,
perhaps
,
might
.
 
<EOS>
You
(
blushing
as
she
spoke
)
who
can
see
into
every
body
's
heart
;
but
nobody
else
 
"
  
"
Upon
my
word
,
"
said
Emma
,
"
I
begin
to
doubt
my
having
any
such
talent
.
<EOS>
Can
you
seriously
ask
me
,
Harriet
,
whether
I
imagined
him
attached
to
another
woman
at
the
very
time
that
I
was
 
tacitly
,
if
not
openly
 
encouraging
you
to
give
way
to
your
own
feelings
?
 
<EOS>
I
never
had
the
slightest
suspicion
,
till
within
the
last
hour
,
of
<EOS>
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
's
having
the
least
regard
for
Jane
Fairfax
.
<EOS>
You
may
be
very
sure
that
if
I
had
,
I
should
have
cautioned
you
accordingly
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Me
!
"
cried
Harriet
,
colouring
,
and
astonished
.
<EOS>
"
Why
should
you
caution
me
?
 
<EOS>
You
do
not
think
I
care
about
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
delighted
to
hear
you
speak
so
stoutly
on
the
subject
,
"
replied
Emma
,
smiling
;
"
but
you
do
not
mean
to
deny
that
there
was
a
time
 
<EOS>
and
not
very
distant
<EOS>
either
 
when
you
gave
me
reason
to
understand
that
you
did
care
about
him
?
"
  
"
Him
!
 
never
,
never
.
<EOS>
Dear
Miss
Woodhouse
,
how
could
you
so
mistake
me
?
"
<EOS>
turning
away
distressed
.
  
<EOS>
"
Harriet
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Emma
,
after
a
moment
's
pause
 
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
?
 
<EOS>
Good
Heaven
!
<EOS>
what
do
you
mean
?
 
<EOS>
Mistake
you
!
 
<EOS>
Am
I
to
suppose
then
?
 
<EOS>
"
  
She
could
not
speak
another
word
.
 
<EOS>
Her
voice
was
lost
;
and
she
sat
down
,
waiting
in
great
terror
till
Harriet
should
answer
.
  
<EOS>
Harriet
,
who
was
standing
at
some
distance
,
and
with
face
turned
from
her
,
did
not
immediately
say
any
thing
;
and
when
she
did
speak
,
it
was
in
a
voice
nearly
as
agitated
as
Emma
's
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
not
have
thought
it
possible
,
"
she
began
,
"
that
you
could
have
misunderstood
me
!
<EOS>
I
know
we
agreed
never
to
name
him
 
but
considering
how
infinitely
superior
he
is
to
every
body
else
,
I
should
not
have
thought
it
possible
that
I
could
be
supposed
to
mean
any
other
person
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
who
would
ever
look
at
him
in
the
company
of
the
other
.
<EOS>
I
hope
I
have
a
better
taste
than
to
think
of
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
,
who
is
like
nobody
by
his
side
.
<EOS>
And
that
you
should
have
been
so
mistaken
,
is
amazing
!
 
<EOS>
I
am
sure
,
but
for
believing
that
you
entirely
approved
and
meant
to
encourage
me
in
my
attachment
,
I
should
have
considered
it
at
first
too
great
a
presumption
almost
,
to
dare
to
think
of
him
.
<EOS>
At
first
,
if
you
had
not
told
me
that
more
wonderful
things
had
happened
;
that
there
had
been
matches
of
greater
disparity
<EOS>
(
those
were
your
very
words
)
;
 
I
should
not
have
dared
to
give
way
to
 
<EOS>
I
should
not
have
thought
it
possible
 
<EOS>
But
if
_
you
_
,
who
had
been
always
acquainted
with
him
 
"
  
"
Harriet
!
"
cried
Emma
,
collecting
herself
resolutely
 
<EOS>
"
Let
us
understand
each
other
now
,
without
the
possibility
of
farther
mistake
.
<EOS>
Are
you
speaking
of
 
Mr.
Knightley
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
To
be
sure
I
am
.
<EOS>
I
never
could
have
an
idea
of
any
body
else
 
<EOS>
and
so
I
thought
you
knew
.
<EOS>
When
we
talked
about
him
,
it
was
as
clear
as
possible
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
quite
,
"
returned
Emma
,
with
forced
calmness
,
"
for
all
that
you
then
said
,
appeared
to
me
to
relate
to
a
different
person
.
<EOS>
I
could
almost
assert
that
you
had
_
named
_
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
the
service
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
had
rendered
you
,
in
protecting
you
from
the
gipsies
,
was
spoken
of
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
<EOS>
Miss
Woodhouse
,
how
you
do
forget
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Harriet
,
I
perfectly
remember
the
substance
of
what
I
said
on
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
I
told
you
that
I
did
not
wonder
at
your
attachment
;
that
considering
the
service
he
had
rendered
you
,
it
was
extremely
natural
:
 
and
you
agreed
to
it
,
expressing
yourself
very
warmly
as
to
your
sense
of
that
service
,
and
mentioning
even
what
your
sensations
had
been
in
seeing
him
come
forward
to
your
rescue
.
 
<EOS>
The
impression
of
it
is
strong
on
my
memory
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
dear
,
"
cried
Harriet
,
"
now
I
recollect
what
you
mean
;
but
I
was
thinking
of
something
very
different
at
the
time
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
the
gipsies
 
<EOS>
it
was
not
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
that
I
meant
.
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
(
with
some
elevation
)
I
was
thinking
of
a
much
more
precious
circumstance
 
of
Mr.
Knightley
's
coming
and
asking
me
to
dance
,
when
Mr.
Elton
would
not
stand
up
with
me
;
and
when
there
was
no
other
partner
in
the
room
.
<EOS>
That
was
the
kind
action
;
that
was
the
noble
benevolence
and
generosity
;
that
was
the
service
which
made
me
begin
to
feel
how
superior
he
was
to
every
other
being
upon
earth
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Good
God
!
"
cried
Emma
,
"
this
has
been
a
most
unfortunate
 
most
deplorable
mistake
!
 
<EOS>
What
is
to
be
done
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
would
not
have
encouraged
me
,
then
,
if
you
had
understood
me
?
<EOS>
At
least
,
however
,
I
can
not
be
worse
off
than
I
should
have
been
,
if
the
other
had
been
the
person
;
and
<EOS>
now
 
it
<EOS>
_
is
_
possible
 
"
  
<EOS>
She
paused
a
few
moments
.
<EOS>
Emma
could
not
speak
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
wonder
,
Miss
Woodhouse
,
"
she
resumed
,
"
that
you
should
feel
a
great
difference
between
the
two
,
as
to
me
or
as
to
any
body
.
<EOS>
You
must
think
one
five
hundred
million
times
more
above
me
than
the
other
.
<EOS>
But
I
hope
,
Miss
Woodhouse
,
that
supposing
 
<EOS>
that
if
 
strange
as
it
may
appear
 
.
<EOS>
But
you
know
they
were
your
own
words
,
that
_
more
_
wonderful
things
had
happened
,
matches
of
_
greater
_
disparity
had
taken
place
than
between
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
and
me
;
and
,
therefore
,
it
seems
as
if
such
a
thing
even
as
this
,
may
have
occurred
before
 
and
if
I
should
be
so
fortunate
,
beyond
expression
,
as
to
 
if
Mr.
Knightley
should
really
 
if
_
he
_
does
not
mind
the
disparity
,
I
hope
,
<EOS>
dear
Miss
Woodhouse
,
you
will
not
set
yourself
against
it
,
and
try
to
put
difficulties
in
the
way
.
<EOS>
But
you
are
too
good
for
that
,
I
am
sure
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Harriet
was
standing
at
one
of
the
windows
.
<EOS>
Emma
turned
round
to
look
at
her
in
consternation
,
and
hastily
said
,
  
"
Have
you
any
idea
of
Mr.
Knightley
's
returning
your
affection
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
replied
Harriet
modestly
,
but
not
fearfully
 
<EOS>
"
I
must
say
that
I
have
.
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
's
eyes
were
instantly
withdrawn
;
and
she
sat
silently
meditating
,
in
a
fixed
attitude
,
for
a
few
minutes
.
<EOS>
A
few
minutes
were
sufficient
for
making
her
acquainted
with
her
own
heart
.
<EOS>
A
mind
like
hers
,
once
opening
to
suspicion
,
made
rapid
progress
.
<EOS>
She
touched
 
<EOS>
she
admitted
 
<EOS>
she
acknowledged
the
whole
truth
.
<EOS>
Why
was
it
so
much
worse
that
Harriet
should
be
in
love
with
Mr.
Knightley
,
than
with
Frank
Churchill
?
<EOS>
Why
was
the
evil
so
dreadfully
increased
by
<EOS>
Harriet
's
having
some
hope
of
a
return
?
<EOS>
It
darted
through
her
,
with
the
speed
of
an
arrow
,
that
Mr.
Knightley
must
marry
no
one
but
herself
!
  
<EOS>
Her
own
conduct
,
as
well
as
her
own
heart
,
was
before
her
in
the
same
few
minutes
.
<EOS>
She
saw
it
all
with
a
clearness
which
had
never
blessed
her
before
.
<EOS>
How
improperly
had
she
been
acting
by
Harriet
!
<EOS>
How
inconsiderate
,
how
indelicate
,
how
irrational
,
how
unfeeling
had
been
her
conduct
!
<EOS>
What
blindness
,
what
madness
,
had
led
her
on
!
<EOS>
It
struck
her
with
dreadful
force
,
and
she
was
ready
to
give
it
every
bad
name
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
Some
portion
of
respect
for
herself
,
however
,
in
spite
of
all
these
demerits
 
some
concern
for
her
own
appearance
,
and
a
strong
sense
of
justice
by
Harriet
 
<EOS>
(
there
would
be
no
need
of
_
compassion
_
to
the
girl
who
believed
herself
loved
by
Mr.
Knightley
 
but
justice
required
that
she
should
not
be
made
unhappy
by
any
coldness
now
,
)
<EOS>
gave
Emma
the
resolution
to
sit
and
endure
farther
with
calmness
,
with
even
apparent
kindness
.
 
<EOS>
For
her
own
advantage
indeed
,
it
was
fit
that
the
utmost
extent
of
Harriet
's
hopes
should
be
enquired
into
;
and
Harriet
had
done
nothing
to
forfeit
the
regard
and
interest
which
had
been
so
voluntarily
formed
and
maintained
 
or
to
deserve
to
be
slighted
by
the
person
,
whose
counsels
had
never
led
her
right
.
 
<EOS>
Rousing
from
reflection
,
therefore
,
and
subduing
her
emotion
,
she
turned
to
Harriet
again
,
and
,
in
a
more
inviting
accent
,
renewed
the
conversation
;
for
as
to
the
subject
which
had
first
introduced
it
,
the
wonderful
story
of
Jane
Fairfax
,
that
was
quite
sunk
and
lost
.
 
<EOS>
Neither
of
them
thought
but
of
Mr.
Knightley
and
themselves
.
  
<EOS>
Harriet
,
who
had
been
standing
in
no
unhappy
reverie
,
was
yet
very
glad
to
be
called
from
it
,
by
the
now
encouraging
manner
of
such
a
judge
,
and
such
a
friend
as
Miss
Woodhouse
,
and
<EOS>
only
wanted
invitation
,
to
give
the
history
of
her
hopes
with
great
,
though
trembling
delight
.
 
<EOS>
Emma
's
tremblings
as
she
asked
,
and
as
she
listened
,
were
better
concealed
than
Harriet
's
,
but
they
were
not
less
.
<EOS>
Her
voice
was
not
unsteady
;
but
her
mind
was
in
all
the
perturbation
that
such
a
development
of
self
,
such
a
burst
of
threatening
evil
,
such
a
confusion
of
sudden
and
perplexing
emotions
,
must
create
.
 
<EOS>
She
listened
with
much
inward
suffering
,
but
with
great
outward
patience
,
to
Harriet
's
detail
.
 
<EOS>
Methodical
,
or
well
arranged
,
or
very
well
delivered
,
it
could
not
be
expected
to
be
;
but
it
contained
,
when
separated
from
all
the
feebleness
and
tautology
of
the
narration
,
a
substance
to
sink
her
spirit
 
especially
with
the
corroborating
circumstances
,
which
her
own
memory
brought
in
favour
of
Mr.
Knightley
's
most
improved
opinion
of
Harriet
.
  
<EOS>
Harriet
had
been
conscious
of
a
difference
in
his
behaviour
ever
since
those
two
decisive
dances
.
 
<EOS>
Emma
knew
that
he
had
,
on
that
occasion
,
found
her
much
superior
to
his
expectation
.
<EOS>
From
that
evening
,
or
at
least
from
the
time
of
Miss
Woodhouse
's
encouraging
her
to
think
of
him
,
Harriet
had
begun
to
be
sensible
of
his
talking
to
her
much
more
than
he
had
been
used
to
do
,
and
of
his
having
indeed
quite
a
different
manner
towards
her
;
a
manner
of
kindness
and
sweetness
!
 
<EOS>
Latterly
she
had
been
more
and
more
aware
of
it
.
<EOS>
When
they
had
been
all
walking
together
,
he
had
so
often
come
and
walked
by
her
,
and
talked
so
very
delightfully
!
 
<EOS>
He
seemed
to
want
to
be
acquainted
with
her
.
<EOS>
Emma
knew
it
to
have
been
very
much
the
case
.
<EOS>
She
had
often
observed
the
change
,
to
almost
the
same
extent
.
 
<EOS>
Harriet
repeated
expressions
of
approbation
and
praise
from
him
 
and
Emma
felt
them
to
be
in
the
closest
agreement
with
what
she
had
known
of
his
opinion
of
Harriet
.
<EOS>
He
praised
her
for
being
without
art
or
affectation
,
for
having
simple
,
honest
,
generous
,
feelings
.
 
<EOS>
She
knew
that
he
saw
such
recommendations
in
Harriet
;
he
had
dwelt
on
them
to
her
more
than
once
.
 
<EOS>
Much
that
lived
in
Harriet
's
memory
,
many
little
particulars
of
the
notice
she
had
received
from
him
,
a
look
,
a
speech
,
a
removal
from
one
chair
to
another
,
a
compliment
implied
,
a
preference
inferred
,
had
been
unnoticed
,
because
unsuspected
,
by
Emma
.
<EOS>
Circumstances
that
might
swell
to
half
an
hour
's
relation
,
and
contained
multiplied
proofs
to
her
who
had
seen
them
,
had
passed
undiscerned
by
her
who
now
heard
them
;
but
the
two
latest
occurrences
to
be
mentioned
,
the
two
of
strongest
promise
to
Harriet
,
were
not
without
some
degree
of
witness
from
Emma
herself
.
 
<EOS>
The
first
,
was
his
walking
with
her
apart
from
the
others
,
in
the
lime
-
walk
at
Donwell
,
where
they
had
been
walking
some
time
before
Emma
came
,
and
he
had
taken
pains
(
as
she
was
convinced
)
to
draw
her
from
the
rest
to
himself
 
and
at
first
,
he
had
talked
to
her
in
a
more
particular
way
than
he
had
ever
done
before
,
in
a
very
particular
way
indeed
!
 
<EOS>
(
Harriet
could
not
recall
it
without
a
blush
.
)
<EOS>
He
seemed
to
be
almost
asking
her
,
whether
her
affections
were
engaged
.
 
<EOS>
But
as
soon
as
she
(
Miss
Woodhouse
)
appeared
likely
to
join
them
,
he
changed
the
subject
,
and
began
talking
about
farming
:
 
The
second
,
was
his
having
sat
talking
with
her
nearly
half
an
hour
before
Emma
came
back
from
her
visit
,
the
very
last
morning
of
his
being
at
Hartfield
 
though
,
when
he
first
came
in
,
he
had
said
that
he
could
not
stay
five
minutes
 
and
his
having
told
her
,
during
their
conversation
,
that
though
he
must
go
to
London
,
it
was
very
much
against
his
inclination
that
he
left
home
at
all
,
which
was
much
more
(
as
Emma
felt
)
than
he
had
acknowledged
to
_
her
_
.
<EOS>
The
superior
degree
of
confidence
towards
Harriet
,
which
this
one
article
marked
,
gave
her
severe
pain
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
subject
of
the
first
of
the
two
circumstances
,
she
did
,
after
a
little
reflection
,
venture
the
following
question
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Might
he
not
?
 
Is
not
it
possible
,
that
when
enquiring
,
as
you
thought
,
into
the
state
of
your
affections
,
he
might
be
alluding
to
Mr.
Martin
 
<EOS>
he
might
have
Mr.
Martin
's
interest
in
view
?
<EOS>
But
Harriet
rejected
the
suspicion
with
spirit
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Martin
!
<EOS>
No
indeed
!
 
<EOS>
There
was
not
a
hint
of
Mr.
Martin
.
<EOS>
I
hope
I
know
better
now
,
than
to
care
for
Mr.
Martin
,
or
to
be
suspected
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
When
Harriet
had
closed
her
evidence
,
she
appealed
to
her
dear
Miss
Woodhouse
,
to
say
whether
she
had
not
good
ground
for
hope
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
should
have
presumed
to
think
of
it
at
first
,
"
said
she
,
"
but
for
you
.
<EOS>
You
told
me
to
observe
him
carefully
,
and
let
his
behaviour
be
the
rule
of
mine
 
<EOS>
and
so
I
have
.
<EOS>
But
now
I
seem
to
feel
that
I
may
deserve
him
;
and
that
if
he
does
chuse
me
,
it
will
not
be
any
thing
so
very
wonderful
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
bitter
feelings
occasioned
by
this
speech
,
the
many
bitter
feelings
,
made
the
utmost
exertion
necessary
on
Emma
's
side
,
to
enable
her
to
say
on
reply
,
  
"
Harriet
,
I
will
only
venture
to
declare
,
that
Mr.
Knightley
is
the
last
man
in
the
world
,
who
would
intentionally
give
any
woman
the
idea
of
his
feeling
for
her
more
than
he
really
does
.
"
  
<EOS>
Harriet
seemed
ready
to
worship
her
friend
for
a
sentence
so
satisfactory
;
and
Emma
was
only
saved
from
raptures
and
fondness
,
which
at
that
moment
would
have
been
dreadful
penance
,
by
the
sound
of
her
father
's
footsteps
.
<EOS>
He
was
coming
through
the
hall
.
<EOS>
Harriet
was
too
much
agitated
to
encounter
him
.
<EOS>
"
She
could
not
compose
herself
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Woodhouse
would
be
alarmed
 
<EOS>
she
had
better
go
;
"
 
with
most
ready
encouragement
from
her
friend
,
therefore
,
she
passed
off
through
another
door
 
and
<EOS>
the
moment
she
was
gone
<EOS>
,
this
was
the
spontaneous
burst
of
Emma
's
feelings
:
"
<EOS>
Oh
God
!
<EOS>
that
I
had
never
seen
her
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
rest
of
the
day
,
the
following
night
,
were
hardly
enough
for
her
thoughts
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
bewildered
amidst
the
confusion
of
all
that
had
rushed
on
her
within
the
last
few
hours
.
<EOS>
Every
moment
had
brought
a
fresh
surprize
;
and
every
surprize
must
be
matter
of
humiliation
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
How
to
understand
it
all
!
<EOS>
How
to
understand
the
deceptions
she
had
been
thus
practising
on
herself
,
and
living
under
!
 
<EOS>
The
blunders
,
the
blindness
of
her
own
head
and
heart
!
 
<EOS>
she
sat
still
<EOS>
,
she
walked
about
,
she
tried
her
own
room
,
she
tried
the
shrubbery
 
in
every
place
,
every
posture
,
she
perceived
that
she
had
acted
most
weakly
;
that
she
had
been
imposed
on
by
others
in
a
most
mortifying
degree
;
that
she
had
been
imposing
on
herself
in
a
degree
yet
more
mortifying
;
that
she
was
wretched
,
and
should
probably
find
this
day
but
the
beginning
of
wretchedness
.
  
<EOS>
To
understand
,
thoroughly
understand
her
own
heart
,
was
the
first
endeavour
.
<EOS>
To
that
point
went
every
leisure
moment
which
her
father
's
claims
on
her
allowed
,
and
every
moment
of
involuntary
absence
of
mind
.
  
<EOS>
How
long
had
Mr.
Knightley
been
so
dear
to
her
,
as
every
feeling
declared
him
now
to
be
?
<EOS>
When
had
his
influence
,
such
influence
begun
?
  
<EOS>
When
had
he
succeeded
to
that
place
in
her
affection
,
which
Frank
Churchill
had
once
,
for
a
short
period
,
occupied
?
 
<EOS>
She
looked
back
;
she
compared
the
two
 
compared
them
,
as
they
had
always
stood
in
her
estimation
,
from
the
time
of
the
latter
's
becoming
known
to
her
 
<EOS>
and
as
they
must
at
any
time
have
been
compared
by
her
,
had
it
 
<EOS>
oh
!
had
it
,
by
any
blessed
felicity
,
occurred
to
her
,
to
institute
the
comparison
.
 
<EOS>
She
saw
that
there
never
had
been
a
time
when
she
did
not
consider
Mr.
Knightley
as
infinitely
the
superior
,
or
when
his
regard
for
her
had
not
been
infinitely
the
most
dear
.
<EOS>
She
saw
,
that
in
persuading
herself
,
in
fancying
,
in
acting
to
the
contrary
,
she
had
been
entirely
under
a
delusion
,
totally
ignorant
of
her
own
heart
 
and
,
in
short
,
that
she
had
never
really
cared
for
Frank
Churchill
at
all
!
  
<EOS>
This
was
the
conclusion
of
the
first
series
of
reflection
.
<EOS>
This
was
the
knowledge
of
herself
,
on
the
first
question
of
inquiry
,
which
she
reached
;
and
without
being
long
in
reaching
it
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
most
sorrowfully
indignant
;
ashamed
of
every
sensation
but
<EOS>
the
one
revealed
to
her
 
her
affection
for
Mr.
Knightley
.
 
<EOS>
Every
other
part
of
her
mind
was
disgusting
.
  
<EOS>
With
insufferable
vanity
had
she
believed
herself
in
the
secret
of
every
body
's
feelings
;
with
unpardonable
arrogance
proposed
to
arrange
every
body
's
destiny
.
<EOS>
She
was
proved
to
have
been
universally
mistaken
;
and
she
had
not
quite
done
nothing
 
for
she
had
done
mischief
.
<EOS>
She
had
brought
evil
on
Harriet
,
on
herself
,
and
she
too
much
feared
,
on
Mr.
Knightley
.
 
<EOS>
Were
this
most
unequal
of
all
connexions
to
take
place
,
on
her
must
rest
all
the
reproach
of
having
given
it
a
beginning
;
for
his
attachment
,
she
must
believe
to
be
produced
only
by
a
consciousness
of
Harriet
's
;
 
and
even
were
this
not
the
case
,
he
would
never
have
known
Harriet
at
all
but
for
her
folly
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Knightley
and
Harriet
Smith
!
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
union
to
distance
every
wonder
of
the
kind
.
 
<EOS>
The
attachment
of
Frank
Churchill
and
Jane
Fairfax
became
commonplace
,
threadbare
,
stale
in
the
comparison
,
exciting
no
surprize
,
presenting
no
disparity
,
affording
nothing
to
be
said
or
thought
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Knightley
and
Harriet
Smith
!
 
<EOS>
Such
an
elevation
on
her
side
!
<EOS>
Such
a
debasement
on
his
!
<EOS>
It
was
horrible
to
Emma
to
think
how
it
must
sink
him
in
the
general
opinion
,
to
foresee
the
smiles
,
the
sneers
,
the
merriment
it
would
prompt
at
his
expense
;
the
mortification
and
disdain
of
his
brother
,
the
thousand
inconveniences
to
himself
.
 
<EOS>
Could
it
be
?
 
<EOS>
No
;
it
was
impossible
.
<EOS>
And
yet
it
was
far
,
very
far
,
from
impossible
.
 
<EOS>
Was
it
a
new
circumstance
for
a
man
of
first
-
rate
abilities
to
be
captivated
by
very
inferior
powers
?
<EOS>
Was
it
new
for
one
,
perhaps
too
busy
to
seek
,
to
be
the
prize
of
a
girl
who
would
seek
him
?
 
<EOS>
Was
it
new
for
any
thing
in
this
world
to
be
unequal
,
inconsistent
,
incongruous
 
or
for
chance
and
circumstance
(
as
second
causes
)
to
direct
the
human
fate
?
  
<EOS>
Oh
!
had
she
never
brought
Harriet
forward
!
<EOS>
Had
she
left
her
where
she
ought
,
and
where
he
had
told
her
she
ought
!
 
<EOS>
Had
she
not
,
with
a
folly
which
no
tongue
could
express
,
prevented
her
marrying
the
unexceptionable
young
man
who
would
have
made
her
happy
and
respectable
in
the
line
of
life
to
which
she
ought
to
belong
 
all
would
have
been
safe
;
none
of
this
dreadful
sequel
would
have
been
.
  
<EOS>
How
Harriet
could
ever
have
had
the
presumption
to
raise
her
thoughts
to
Mr.
Knightley
!
 
<EOS>
How
she
could
dare
to
fancy
herself
the
chosen
of
such
a
man
till
actually
assured
of
it
!
 
<EOS>
But
Harriet
was
less
humble
,
had
fewer
scruples
than
formerly
.
 
<EOS>
Her
inferiority
,
whether
of
mind
or
situation
,
seemed
little
felt
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
seemed
more
sensible
of
Mr.
Elton
's
being
to
stoop
in
marrying
her
,
than
she
now
seemed
of
Mr.
Knightley
's
.
 
<EOS>
Alas
!
<EOS>
was
not
that
her
own
doing
too
?
<EOS>
Who
had
been
at
pains
to
give
Harriet
notions
of
self
-
consequence
but
herself
?
 
<EOS>
Who
but
herself
had
taught
her
,
that
she
was
to
elevate
herself
if
possible
,
and
that
her
claims
were
great
to
a
high
worldly
establishment
?
 
<EOS>
If
Harriet
,
from
being
humble
,
were
grown
vain
,
it
was
her
doing
too
.
    
<EOS>
Till
now
that
she
was
threatened
with
its
loss
,
Emma
had
never
known
how
much
of
her
happiness
depended
on
being
_
first
_
with
Mr.
Knightley
,
first
in
interest
and
affection
.
 
<EOS>
Satisfied
that
it
was
so
,
and
feeling
it
her
due
,
she
had
enjoyed
it
without
reflection
;
and
only
in
the
dread
of
being
supplanted
,
found
how
inexpressibly
important
it
had
been
.
 
<EOS>
Long
,
very
long
,
she
felt
she
had
been
first
;
for
,
having
no
female
connexions
of
his
own
,
there
had
been
only
Isabella
whose
claims
could
be
compared
with
hers
,
and
she
had
always
known
exactly
how
far
he
loved
and
esteemed
Isabella
.
<EOS>
She
had
herself
been
first
with
him
for
many
years
past
.
<EOS>
She
had
not
deserved
it
;
she
had
often
been
negligent
or
perverse
,
slighting
his
advice
,
or
even
wilfully
opposing
him
,
insensible
of
half
his
merits
,
and
quarrelling
with
him
because
he
would
not
acknowledge
her
false
and
insolent
estimate
of
her
own
 
but
still
,
from
family
attachment
and
habit
,
and
thorough
excellence
of
mind
,
he
had
loved
her
,
and
watched
over
her
from
a
girl
,
with
an
endeavour
to
improve
her
,
and
an
anxiety
for
her
doing
right
,
which
no
other
creature
had
at
all
shared
.
<EOS>
In
spite
of
all
her
faults
,
she
knew
she
was
dear
to
him
;
might
she
not
say
,
very
dear
?
 
<EOS>
When
the
suggestions
of
hope
,
however
,
which
must
follow
here
,
presented
themselves
,
she
could
not
presume
to
indulge
them
.
<EOS>
Harriet
Smith
might
think
herself
not
unworthy
of
being
peculiarly
,
exclusively
,
passionately
loved
by
Mr.
Knightley
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
She
_
could
not
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
flatter
herself
with
any
idea
of
blindness
in
his
attachment
to
_
her
_
.
<EOS>
She
had
received
a
very
recent
proof
of
its
impartiality
.
 
<EOS>
How
shocked
had
he
been
by
her
behaviour
to
Miss
Bates
!
<EOS>
How
directly
,
how
strongly
had
he
expressed
himself
to
her
on
the
subject
!
 
<EOS>
Not
too
strongly
for
the
offence
 
but
far
,
far
too
strongly
to
issue
from
any
feeling
softer
than
upright
justice
and
clear
-
sighted
goodwill
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
no
hope
,
nothing
to
deserve
the
name
of
hope
,
that
he
could
have
that
sort
of
affection
for
herself
which
was
now
in
question
;
but
there
was
a
hope
(
at
times
a
slight
one
,
at
times
much
stronger
,
)
<EOS>
that
Harriet
might
have
deceived
herself
,
and
be
overrating
his
regard
for
_
her
_
.
 
<EOS>
Wish
it
<EOS>
she
must
,
for
his
sake
 
be
the
consequence
nothing
to
herself
,
but
his
remaining
single
all
his
life
.
<EOS>
Could
she
be
secure
of
that
,
indeed
,
of
his
never
marrying
at
all
<EOS>
,
she
believed
she
should
be
perfectly
satisfied
.
 
<EOS>
Let
him
but
continue
the
same
Mr.
Knightley
to
her
and
her
father
,
the
same
Mr.
Knightley
to
all
the
world
;
let
Donwell
and
Hartfield
lose
none
of
their
precious
intercourse
of
friendship
and
confidence
,
and
her
peace
would
be
fully
secured
.
 
<EOS>
Marriage
,
in
fact
,
would
not
do
for
her
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
incompatible
with
what
she
owed
to
her
father
,
and
with
what
she
felt
for
him
.
<EOS>
Nothing
should
separate
her
from
her
father
.
<EOS>
She
would
not
marry
,
even
if
she
were
asked
by
Mr.
Knightley
.
  
<EOS>
It
must
be
her
ardent
wish
that
Harriet
might
be
disappointed
;
and
she
hoped
,
that
when
able
to
see
them
together
again
,
she
might
at
least
be
able
to
ascertain
what
the
chances
for
it
were
.
 
<EOS>
She
should
see
them
henceforward
with
the
closest
observance
;
and
wretchedly
as
she
had
hitherto
misunderstood
even
those
she
was
watching
,
she
did
not
know
how
to
admit
that
she
could
be
blinded
here
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
expected
back
every
day
.
<EOS>
The
power
of
observation
would
be
soon
given
 
frightfully
soon
it
appeared
when
her
thoughts
were
in
one
course
.
<EOS>
In
the
meanwhile
,
she
resolved
against
seeing
Harriet
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
do
neither
of
them
good
<EOS>
,
it
would
do
the
subject
<EOS>
no
good
,
to
be
talking
of
it
farther
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
resolved
not
to
be
convinced
,
as
long
as
she
could
doubt
,
and
yet
had
no
authority
for
opposing
Harriet
's
confidence
.
<EOS>
To
talk
would
be
only
to
irritate
.
 
<EOS>
She
wrote
to
her
,
therefore
,
kindly
,
but
decisively
,
to
beg
that
she
would
not
,
at
present
,
come
to
Hartfield
;
acknowledging
it
to
be
her
conviction
,
that
all
farther
confidential
discussion
of
_
one
<EOS>
_
topic
had
better
be
avoided
;
and
hoping
,
that
if
a
few
days
were
allowed
to
pass
before
they
met
again
,
except
in
the
company
of
others
 
<EOS>
she
objected
only
to
a
tete
-
a
-
tete
 
they
might
be
able
to
act
as
if
they
had
forgotten
the
conversation
of
yesterday
.
 
<EOS>
Harriet
submitted
,
and
approved
,
and
was
grateful
.
  
<EOS>
This
point
was
just
arranged
,
when
a
visitor
arrived
to
tear
Emma
's
thoughts
a
little
from
the
one
subject
which
had
engrossed
them
,
sleeping
or
waking
,
the
last
twenty
-
four
hours
 
Mrs.
Weston
,
who
had
been
calling
on
her
daughter
-
in
-
law
elect
,
and
took
Hartfield
in
her
way
home
,
almost
as
much
in
duty
to
Emma
as
in
pleasure
to
herself
,
to
relate
all
the
particulars
of
so
interesting
an
interview
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Weston
had
accompanied
her
to
Mrs.
Bates
's
,
and
gone
through
his
share
of
this
essential
attention
most
handsomely
;
but
she
having
then
induced
Miss
Fairfax
to
join
her
in
an
airing
,
was
now
returned
with
much
more
to
say
,
and
much
more
to
say
with
satisfaction
,
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
spent
in
Mrs.
Bates
's
parlour
,
with
all
the
encumbrance
of
awkward
feelings
,
could
have
afforded
.
  
<EOS>
A
little
curiosity
Emma
had
;
and
she
made
the
most
of
it
while
her
friend
related
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Weston
had
set
off
to
pay
the
visit
in
a
good
deal
of
agitation
herself
;
and
in
the
first
place
had
wished
not
to
go
at
all
at
present
,
to
be
allowed
merely
to
write
to
Miss
Fairfax
instead
,
and
to
defer
this
ceremonious
call
till
a
little
time
had
passed
,
and
Mr.
Churchill
could
be
reconciled
to
the
engagement
's
becoming
known
;
as
,
considering
every
thing
,
she
thought
such
a
visit
could
not
be
paid
without
leading
to
reports
:
 
but
Mr.
Weston
had
thought
differently
;
he
was
extremely
anxious
to
shew
his
approbation
to
Miss
Fairfax
and
her
family
,
and
did
not
conceive
that
any
suspicion
could
be
excited
by
it
;
or
if
it
were
,
that
it
would
be
of
any
consequence
;
for
"
such
things
,
"
he
observed
,
"
always
got
about
.
"
<EOS>
Emma
smiled
,
and
felt
that
Mr.
Weston
had
very
good
reason
for
saying
so
.
<EOS>
They
had
gone
,
in
short
 
and
very
great
<EOS>
had
been
the
evident
distress
and
confusion
of
the
lady
.
<EOS>
She
had
hardly
been
able
to
speak
a
word
,
and
every
look
and
action
had
shewn
how
deeply
she
was
suffering
from
consciousness
.
<EOS>
The
quiet
,
heart
-
felt
satisfaction
of
the
old
lady
,
and
the
rapturous
delight
of
her
daughter
 
who
proved
even
too
joyous
to
talk
as
usual
,
had
been
a
gratifying
,
yet
almost
an
affecting
,
scene
.
<EOS>
They
were
both
so
truly
respectable
in
their
happiness
,
so
disinterested
in
every
sensation
;
thought
so
much
of
Jane
;
so
much
of
every
body
,
and
so
little
of
themselves
,
that
every
kindly
feeling
was
at
work
for
them
.
<EOS>
Miss
Fairfax
's
recent
illness
had
offered
a
fair
plea
for
Mrs.
Weston
to
invite
her
to
an
airing
;
she
had
drawn
back
and
declined
at
first
,
but
,
on
being
pressed
had
yielded
;
and
,
in
the
course
of
their
drive
,
Mrs.
Weston
had
,
by
gentle
encouragement
,
overcome
so
much
of
her
embarrassment
,
as
to
bring
her
to
converse
on
the
important
subject
.
<EOS>
Apologies
for
her
seemingly
ungracious
silence
in
their
first
reception
,
and
the
warmest
expressions
of
the
gratitude
she
was
always
feeling
towards
herself
and
Mr.
Weston
,
must
necessarily
open
the
cause
;
but
when
these
effusions
were
put
by
,
they
had
talked
a
good
deal
of
the
present
and
of
the
future
state
of
the
engagement
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Weston
was
convinced
that
such
conversation
must
be
the
greatest
relief
to
her
companion
,
pent
up
within
her
own
mind
as
every
thing
had
so
long
been
,
and
was
very
much
pleased
with
all
that
she
had
said
on
the
subject
.
  
<EOS>
"
On
the
misery
of
what
she
had
suffered
,
during
the
concealment
of
so
many
months
,
"
continued
Mrs.
Weston
,
"
she
was
energetic
.
<EOS>
This
was
one
of
her
expressions
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
say
,
that
since
I
entered
into
the
engagement
I
have
not
had
some
happy
moments
;
but
I
can
say
,
that
I
have
never
known
the
blessing
of
one
tranquil
hour
:
"
 
and
the
quivering
lip
,
Emma
,
which
uttered
it
,
was
an
attestation
that
I
felt
at
my
heart
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Poor
girl
!
"
said
Emma
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
thinks
herself
wrong
,
then
,
for
having
consented
to
a
private
engagement
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Wrong
!
<EOS>
No
one
,
I
believe
,
can
blame
her
more
than
she
is
disposed
to
blame
herself
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
consequence
,
"
said
she
,
"
has
been
a
state
of
perpetual
suffering
to
me
;
and
so
it
ought
.
<EOS>
But
after
all
the
punishment
that
misconduct
can
bring
,
it
is
still
not
less
misconduct
.
<EOS>
Pain
is
no
expiation
.
<EOS>
I
never
can
be
blameless
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
acting
contrary
to
all
my
sense
of
right
;
and
the
fortunate
turn
that
every
thing
has
taken
,
and
the
kindness
I
am
now
receiving
,
is
what
my
conscience
tells
me
ought
not
to
be
.
"
<EOS>
"
Do
not
imagine
,
madam
,
"
she
continued
,
"
that
I
was
taught
wrong
.
<EOS>
Do
not
let
any
reflection
fall
on
the
principles
or
the
care
of
the
friends
who
brought
me
up
.
<EOS>
The
error
has
been
all
my
own
;
and
I
do
assure
you
that
,
with
all
the
excuse
that
present
circumstances
may
appear
to
give

I
shall
yet
dread
making
the
story
known

Colonel
Campbell

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Poor
girl
!
"
said
Emma
again
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
loves
him
then
excessively
,
I
suppose
.
<EOS>
It
must
have
been
from
attachment
only
,
that
she
could
be
led
to
form
the
engagement
.
<EOS>
Her
affection
must
have
overpowered
her
judgment
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
have
no
doubt
of
her
being
extremely
attached
to
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
afraid
,
"
returned
Emma
,
sighing
,
"
that
I
must
often
have
contributed
to
make
her
unhappy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
On
your
side
,
my
love
,
it
was
very
innocently
done
.
<EOS>
But
she
probably
had
something
of
that
in
her
thoughts
,
when
alluding
to
the
misunderstandings
which
he
had
given
us
hints
of
before
.
<EOS>
One
natural
consequence
of
the
evil
she
had
involved
herself
in
,
"
she
said
,
"
was
that
of
making
her
_
unreasonable
_
.
<EOS>
The
consciousness
of
having
done
amiss
,
had
exposed
her
to
a
thousand
inquietudes
,
and
made
her
captious
and
irritable
to
a
degree
that
must
have
been
 
that
had
been
 
hard
for
him
to
bear
.
<EOS>
"
I
did
not
make
the
allowances
,
"
said
she
,
"
which
I
ought
to
have
done
,
for
his
temper
and
spirits
 
his
delightful
spirits
,
and
that
gaiety
,
that
playfulness
of
disposition
,
which
,
under
any
other
circumstances
,
would
,
I
am
sure
,
have
been
as
constantly
bewitching
to
me
,
as
they
were
at
first
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
then
began
to
speak
of
you
,
and
of
the
great
kindness
you
had
shewn
her
during
her
illness
;
and
with
a
blush
which
shewed
me
how
it
was
all
connected
,
desired
me
,
whenever
I
had
an
opportunity
,
to
thank
you
 
I
could
not
thank
you
too
much
 
for
every
wish
and
every
endeavour
to
do
her
good
.
<EOS>
She
was
sensible
that
you
had
never
received
any
proper
acknowledgment
from
herself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
did
not
know
her
to
be
happy
now
,
"
said
Emma
,
seriously
,
"
which
,
in
spite
of
every
little
drawback
from
her
scrupulous
conscience
,
she
must
be
,
I
could
not
bear
these
thanks
;
 
for
,
oh
!
<EOS>
Mrs.
Weston
,
if
there
were
an
account
drawn
up
of
the
evil
and
the
good
I
have
done
Miss
Fairfax
!
 
<EOS>
Well
(
checking
herself
,
and
trying
to
be
more
lively
)
,
this
is
all
to
be
forgotten
.
<EOS>
You
are
very
kind
to
bring
me
these
interesting
particulars
.
<EOS>
They
shew
her
to
the
greatest
advantage
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
she
is
very
good
 
<EOS>
I
hope
she
will
be
very
happy
.
<EOS>
It
is
fit
that
the
fortune
should
be
on
his
side
,
for
I
think
the
merit
will
be
all
on
hers
.
"
  
<EOS>
Such
a
conclusion
could
not
pass
unanswered
by
Mrs.
Weston
.
<EOS>
She
thought
well
of
Frank
in
almost
every
respect
;
and
,
what
was
more
,
she
loved
him
very
much
,
and
her
defence
was
,
therefore
,
earnest
.
<EOS>
She
talked
with
a
great
deal
of
reason
,
and
at
least
equal
affection
 
<EOS>
but
she
had
too
much
to
urge
for
Emma
's
attention
;
it
was
soon
gone
to
Brunswick
Square
or
to
Donwell
;
she
forgot
to
attempt
to
listen
;
and
when
Mrs.
Weston
ended
with
,
"
We
have
not
yet
had
the
letter
we
are
so
anxious
for
,
you
know
,
but
I
hope
it
will
soon
come
,
"
she
was
obliged
to
pause
before
she
answered
,
and
at
last
obliged
to
answer
at
random
,
before
she
could
at
all
recollect
what
letter
it
was
which
they
were
so
anxious
for
.
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
well
,
my
Emma
?
<EOS>
"
was
Mrs.
Weston
's
parting
question
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
perfectly
.
<EOS>
I
am
always
well
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
Be
sure
to
give
me
intelligence
of
the
letter
as
soon
as
possible
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Weston
's
communications
furnished
Emma
with
more
food
for
unpleasant
reflection
,
by
increasing
her
esteem
and
compassion
,
and
her
sense
of
past
injustice
towards
Miss
Fairfax
.
<EOS>
She
bitterly
regretted
not
having
sought
a
closer
acquaintance
with
her
,
and
blushed
for
the
envious
feelings
which
had
certainly
been
,
in
some
measure
,
the
cause
.
<EOS>
Had
she
followed
Mr.
Knightley
's
known
wishes
,
in
paying
that
attention
to
Miss
Fairfax
,
which
was
every
way
her
due
;
<EOS>
had
she
tried
to
know
her
better
;
had
she
done
her
part
towards
intimacy
;
had
she
endeavoured
to
find
a
friend
there
instead
of
in
Harriet
Smith
;
she
must
,
in
all
probability
,
have
been
spared
from
every
pain
which
pressed
on
her
now
.
 
<EOS>
Birth
,
abilities
,
and
education
,
had
been
equally
marking
one
as
an
associate
for
her
,
to
be
received
with
gratitude
;
and
the
other
 
<EOS>
what
was
she
?
 
<EOS>
Supposing
<EOS>
even
that
they
had
never
become
intimate
friends
;
that
she
had
never
been
admitted
into
Miss
Fairfax
's
confidence
on
this
important
matter
 
which
was
most
probable
 
still
,
in
knowing
her
as
she
ought
,
and
as
she
might
,
she
must
have
been
preserved
from
the
abominable
suspicions
of
an
improper
attachment
to
Mr.
Dixon
,
which
she
had
not
only
so
foolishly
fashioned
and
harboured
herself
,
but
had
so
unpardonably
imparted
;
an
idea
which
she
greatly
feared
had
been
made
a
subject
of
material
distress
to
the
delicacy
of
Jane
's
feelings
,
by
the
levity
or
carelessness
of
Frank
Churchill
's
.
<EOS>
Of
all
the
sources
of
evil
surrounding
the
former
,
since
her
coming
to
Highbury
,
she
was
persuaded
that
she
must
herself
have
been
the
worst
.
<EOS>
She
must
have
been
a
perpetual
enemy
.
<EOS>
They
never
could
have
been
all
three
together
,
without
her
having
stabbed
Jane
Fairfax
's
peace
in
a
thousand
instances
;
and
on
Box
Hill
,
perhaps
,
it
had
been
the
agony
of
a
mind
that
would
bear
no
more
.
  
<EOS>
The
evening
of
this
day
was
very
long
,
and
melancholy
,
at
Hartfield
.
<EOS>
The
weather
added
what
it
could
of
gloom
.
<EOS>
A
cold
stormy
rain
set
in
,
and
nothing
of
July
appeared
but
in
the
trees
and
shrubs
,
which
the
wind
was
despoiling
,
and
the
length
of
the
day
,
which
only
made
such
cruel
sights
the
longer
visible
.
  
<EOS>
The
weather
affected
Mr.
Woodhouse
,
and
he
could
only
be
kept
tolerably
comfortable
by
almost
ceaseless
attention
on
his
daughter
's
side
,
and
by
exertions
which
had
never
cost
her
half
so
much
before
.
<EOS>
It
reminded
her
of
their
first
forlorn
tete
-
a
-
tete
,
on
the
evening
of
Mrs.
Weston
's
wedding
-
day
;
but
Mr.
Knightley
had
walked
in
then
,
soon
after
tea
,
and
dissipated
every
melancholy
fancy
.
<EOS>
Alas
!
<EOS>
such
delightful
proofs
of
Hartfield
's
attraction
,
as
those
sort
of
visits
conveyed
,
might
shortly
be
over
.
<EOS>
The
picture
which
she
had
then
drawn
of
the
privations
of
the
approaching
winter
,
had
proved
erroneous
;
no
friends
had
deserted
them
,
no
pleasures
had
been
lost
.
 
<EOS>
But
her
present
forebodings
she
feared
would
experience
no
similar
contradiction
.
<EOS>
The
prospect
before
her
now
,
was
threatening
to
a
degree
that
could
not
be
entirely
dispelled
 
that
might
not
be
even
partially
brightened
.
<EOS>
If
all
took
place
that
might
take
place
among
the
circle
of
her
friends
,
Hartfield
must
be
comparatively
deserted
;
and
she
left
to
cheer
her
father
with
the
spirits
only
of
ruined
happiness
.
  
<EOS>
The
child
to
be
born
at
Randalls
must
be
a
tie
there
even
dearer
than
herself
;
and
Mrs.
Weston
's
heart
and
time
would
be
occupied
by
it
.
<EOS>
They
should
lose
her
;
and
,
probably
,
in
great
measure
,
her
husband
also
.
 
<EOS>
Frank
Churchill
would
return
among
them
no
more
;
and
Miss
Fairfax
,
it
was
reasonable
to
suppose
,
would
soon
cease
to
belong
to
Highbury
.
<EOS>
They
would
be
married
,
and
settled
either
at
or
near
Enscombe
.
<EOS>
All
that
were
good
would
be
withdrawn
;
and
if
to
these
losses
,
the
loss
of
Donwell
were
to
be
added
,
what
would
remain
of
cheerful
or
of
rational
society
within
their
reach
?
<EOS>
Mr.
Knightley
to
be
no
longer
coming
there
for
his
evening
comfort
!
 
<EOS>
No
longer
walking
in
at
all
hours
,
as
if
ever
willing
to
change
his
own
home
for
their
's
!
 
<EOS>
How
was
it
to
be
endured
?
<EOS>
And
if
he
were
to
be
lost
to
them
for
Harriet
's
sake
;
if
he
were
to
be
thought
of
hereafter
,
as
finding
in
Harriet
's
society
all
that
he
wanted
;
if
Harriet
were
to
be
the
chosen
,
the
first
,
the
dearest
,
the
friend
,
the
wife
to
whom
he
looked
for
all
the
best
blessings
of
existence
;
what
could
be
increasing
Emma
's
wretchedness
but
the
reflection
never
far
distant
from
her
mind
,
that
it
had
been
all
her
own
work
?
  
<EOS>
When
it
came
to
such
a
pitch
as
this
,
she
was
not
able
to
refrain
from
a
start
,
or
a
heavy
sigh
,
or
even
from
walking
about
the
room
for
a
few
seconds
 
and
<EOS>
the
only
source
whence
any
thing
like
consolation
or
composure
could
be
drawn
,
was
in
the
resolution
of
her
own
better
conduct
,
and
<EOS>
the
hope
that
,
however
inferior
in
spirit
and
gaiety
might
be
the
following
and
every
future
winter
of
her
life
to
the
past
<EOS>
,
it
would
yet
find
her
more
rational
,
more
acquainted
with
herself
,
and
leave
her
less
to
regret
when
it
were
gone
.
    
<EOS>
The
weather
continued
much
the
same
all
the
following
morning
;
and
the
same
loneliness
,
and
the
same
melancholy
,
seemed
to
reign
at
Hartfield
 
but
in
the
afternoon
it
cleared
;
the
wind
changed
into
a
softer
quarter
;
the
clouds
were
carried
off
;
the
sun
appeared
;
it
was
summer
again
.
<EOS>
With
all
the
eagerness
which
such
a
transition
gives
,
Emma
resolved
to
be
out
of
doors
as
soon
as
possible
.
<EOS>
Never
had
the
exquisite
sight
,
smell
,
sensation
of
nature
,
tranquil
,
warm
,
and
brilliant
after
a
storm
,
been
more
attractive
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
longed
for
the
serenity
they
might
gradually
introduce
;
and
on
Mr.
Perry
's
coming
in
soon
after
dinner
,
with
a
disengaged
hour
to
give
her
father
,
she
lost
no
time
in
hurrying
into
the
shrubbery
.
 
<EOS>
There
,
with
spirits
freshened
,
and
thoughts
a
little
relieved
,
she
had
taken
a
few
turns
,
when
she
saw
Mr.
Knightley
passing
through
the
garden
door
,
and
coming
towards
her
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
the
first
intimation
of
his
being
returned
from
London
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
thinking
of
him
the
moment
before
,
as
unquestionably
sixteen
miles
distant
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
time
only
for
the
quickest
arrangement
of
mind
.
<EOS>
She
must
be
collected
and
calm
.
<EOS>
In
half
a
minute
they
were
together
.
<EOS>
The
"
How
d'ye
do
's
"
were
quiet
and
constrained
on
each
side
.
<EOS>
She
asked
after
their
mutual
friends
;
they
were
all
well
.
 
<EOS>
When
had
he
left
them
?
 
<EOS>
Only
that
morning
.
<EOS>
He
must
have
had
a
wet
ride
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
He
meant
to
walk
with
her
,
she
found
.
<EOS>
"
He
had
just
looked
into
the
dining
-
room
,
and
as
he
was
not
wanted
there
,
preferred
being
out
of
doors
.
"
 
<EOS>
She
thought
he
neither
looked
nor
spoke
cheerfully
;
and
the
first
possible
cause
for
it
,
suggested
by
her
fears
,
was
,
that
he
had
perhaps
been
communicating
his
plans
to
his
brother
,
and
was
pained
by
the
manner
in
which
they
had
been
received
.
  
<EOS>
They
walked
together
.
<EOS>
He
was
silent
.
<EOS>
She
thought
he
was
often
looking
at
her
,
and
trying
for
a
fuller
view
of
her
face
than
it
suited
her
to
give
.
<EOS>
And
this
belief
produced
another
dread
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
he
wanted
to
speak
to
her
,
of
his
attachment
to
Harriet
;
he
might
be
watching
for
encouragement
to
begin
.
 
<EOS>
She
did
not
,
could
not
,
feel
equal
to
lead
the
way
to
any
such
subject
.
<EOS>
He
must
do
it
all
himself
.
<EOS>
Yet
she
could
not
bear
this
silence
.
<EOS>
With
him
it
was
most
unnatural
.
<EOS>
She
considered
 
resolved
 
and
,
trying
to
smile
,
began
    
"
You
have
some
news
to
hear
,
now
you
are
come
back
,
that
will
rather
surprize
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Have
I
?
"
said
he
quietly
,
and
looking
at
her
;
"
of
what
nature
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
the
best
nature
in
the
world
 
a
wedding
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
After
waiting
a
moment
,
as
if
to
be
sure
she
intended
to
say
no
more
,
he
replied
,
  
"
If
you
mean
Miss
Fairfax
and
Frank
Churchill
,
I
have
heard
that
already
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
is
it
possible
?
"
cried
Emma
,
turning
her
glowing
cheeks
towards
him
;
for
,
while
she
spoke
,
it
occurred
to
her
that
he
might
have
called
at
Mrs.
Goddard
's
in
his
way
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
had
a
few
lines
on
parish
business
from
Mr.
Weston
this
morning
,
and
at
the
end
of
them
he
gave
me
a
brief
account
of
what
had
happened
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
was
quite
relieved
,
and
could
presently
say
,
with
a
little
more
composure
,
  
"
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
You
_
probably
have
been
less
surprized
than
any
of
us
,
for
you
have
had
your
suspicions
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
forgotten
that
you
once
tried
to
give
me
a
caution
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
I
had
attended
to
it
 
<EOS>
but
 
(
with
a
sinking
voice
and
a
heavy

I
seem
to
have
been
doomed
to
blindness
.
"
  
<EOS>
For
a
moment
or
two
nothing
was
said
,
and
she
was
unsuspicious
of
having
excited
any
particular
interest
,
till
she
found
her
arm
drawn
within
his
,
and
pressed
against
his
heart
,
and
heard
him
thus
saying
,
in
a
tone
of
great
sensibility
,
speaking
low
,
  
"
Time
,
my
dearest
Emma
,
time
will
heal
the
wound
.
 
<EOS>
Your
own
excellent
sense
 
<EOS>
your
exertions
for
your
father
's
sake
 
<EOS>
I
know
you
will
not
allow
yourself
 
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Her
arm
was
pressed
again
,
as
he
added
,
in
a
more
broken
and
subdued
accent
,
"
The
feelings
of
the
warmest
friendship
 
Indignation
 
Abominable
scoundrel
!
"
 
<EOS>
And
in
a
louder
,
steadier
tone
,
he
concluded
with
,
"
He
will
soon
be
gone
.
<EOS>
They
will
soon
be
in
Yorkshire
.
<EOS>
I
am
sorry
for
_
her
_
.
<EOS>
She
deserves
a
better
fate
.
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
understood
him
;
and
as
soon
as
she
could
recover
from
the
flutter
of
pleasure
,
excited
by
such
tender
consideration
,
replied
,
  
"
<EOS>
You
are
very
kind
 
<EOS>
but
you
are
mistaken
 
<EOS>
and
I
must
set
you
right
.
  
<EOS>
I
am
not
in
want
of
that
sort
of
compassion
.
<EOS>
My
blindness
to
what
was
going
on
,
led
me
to
act
by
them
in
a
way
that
I
must
always
be
ashamed
of
,
and
I
was
very
foolishly
tempted
to
say
and
do
many
things
which
may
well
lay
me
open
to
unpleasant
conjectures
,
but
I
have
no
other
reason
to
regret
that
I
was
not
in
the
secret
earlier
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Emma
!
"
cried
he
,
looking
eagerly
at
her
,
"
are
you
,
indeed
?
"
 
but
checking
himself
 
"
<EOS>
No
,
no
,
I
understand
you
 
forgive
me
 
<EOS>
I
am
pleased
that
you
can
say
even
so
much
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
no
object
of
regret
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
and
it
will
not
be
very
long
,
I
hope
,
before
that
becomes
the
acknowledgment
of
more
than
your
reason
.
 
<EOS>
Fortunate
that
your
affections
were
not
farther
entangled
!
 
<EOS>
I
could
never
,
I
confess
,
from
your
manners
,
assure
myself
as
to
the
degree
of
what
you
felt
 
<EOS>
I
could
only
be
certain
that
there
was
a
preference
 
and
a
preference
which
I
never
believed
him
to
deserve
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
a
disgrace
to
the
name
of
man
.
 
<EOS>
And
is
he
to
be
rewarded
with
that
sweet
young
woman
?
 
<EOS>
Jane
,
Jane
,
you
will
be
a
miserable
creature
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Knightley
,
"
said
Emma
,
trying
to
be
lively
,
but
really
confused
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
in
a
very
extraordinary
situation
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
let
you
continue
in
your
error
;
and
yet
,
perhaps
,
since
my
manners
gave
such
an
impression
,
I
have
as
much
reason
to
be
ashamed
of
confessing
that
I
never
have
been
at
all
attached
to
the
person
we
are
speaking
of
,
as
it
might
be
natural
for
a
woman
to
feel
in
confessing
exactly
the
reverse
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
never
have
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
listened
in
perfect
silence
.
<EOS>
She
wished
him
to
speak
,
but
he
would
not
.
<EOS>
She
supposed
she
must
say
more
before
she
were
entitled
to
his
clemency
;
but
it
was
a
hard
case
to
be
obliged
still
to
lower
herself
in
his
opinion
.
<EOS>
She
went
on
,
however
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
very
little
to
say
for
my
own
conduct
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
tempted
by
his
attentions
,
and
allowed
myself
to
appear
pleased
.
 
<EOS>
An
old
story
,
probably
 
a
common
case
 
and
no
more
<EOS>
than
has
happened
to
hundreds
of
my
sex
before
;
and
yet
it
may
not
be
the
more
excusable
in
one
who
sets
up
as
I
do
for
Understanding
.
<EOS>
Many
circumstances
assisted
the
temptation
.
<EOS>
He
was
the
son
of
Mr.
Weston
 
<EOS>
he
was
continually
here
 
<EOS>
I
always
found
him
very
pleasant
 
<EOS>
and
,
in
short
,
for
(
with
a
sigh
)
let
me
swell
out
the
causes
ever
so
ingeniously
,
they
all
centre
in
this
at
last
 
<EOS>
my
vanity
was
flattered
,
and
I
allowed
his
attentions
.
<EOS>
Latterly
,
however
 
for
some
time
,
indeed
 
I
have
had
no
idea
of
their
meaning
any
thing
.
 
<EOS>
I
thought
them
a
habit
,
a
trick
,
<EOS>
nothing
that
called
for
seriousness
on
my
side
.
<EOS>
He
has
imposed
on
me
,
but
he
has
not
injured
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
never
been
attached
to
him
.
<EOS>
And
now
I
can
tolerably
comprehend
his
behaviour
.
<EOS>
He
never
wished
to
attach
me
.
<EOS>
It
was
merely
a
blind
to
conceal
his
real
situation
with
another
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
his
object
to
blind
all
about
him
;
and
no
one
,
I
am
sure
,
could
be
more
effectually
blinded
than
myself
 
<EOS>
except
that
I
was
_
not
_
blinded
 
that
it
was
my
good
fortune
 
that
,
in
short
,
I
was
somehow
or
other
safe
from
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
had
hoped
for
an
answer
here
 
for
a
few
words
to
say
that
her
conduct
was
at
least
intelligible
;
but
he
was
silent
;
and
,
as
far
as
she
could
judge
,
deep
in
thought
.
<EOS>
At
last
,
and
tolerably
in
his
usual
tone
,
he
said
,
  
"
I
have
never
had
a
high
opinion
of
Frank
Churchill
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
suppose
,
however
,
that
I
may
have
underrated
him
.
<EOS>
My
acquaintance
with
him
has
been
but
trifling
.
 
<EOS>
And
even
if
I
have
not
underrated
him
hitherto
,
he
may
yet
turn
out
well
.
 
<EOS>
With
such
a
woman
he
has
a
chance
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
motive
for
wishing
him
ill
 
and
for
her
sake
,
whose
happiness
will
be
involved
in
his
good
character
and
conduct
,
I
shall
certainly
wish
him
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
doubt
of
their
being
happy
together
,
"
said
Emma
;
"
I
believe
them
to
be
very
mutually
and
very
sincerely
attached
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
a
most
fortunate
man
!
"
returned
Mr.
Knightley
,
with
energy
.
"
<EOS>
So
early
in
life
 
at
three
-
and
-
twenty
 
a
period
when
,
if
a
man
chuses
a
wife
,
he
generally
chuses
ill
.
<EOS>
At
three
-
and
-
twenty
to
have
drawn
such
a
prize
!
<EOS>
What
years
of
felicity
that
man
,
in
all
human
calculation
,
has
before
him
!
 
<EOS>
Assured
of
the
love
of
such
a
woman
 
the
disinterested
love
,
for
Jane
Fairfax
's
character
vouches
for
her
disinterestedness
;
every
thing
in
his
favour
,
 
equality
of
situation
 
I
mean
,
as
far
as
regards
society
,
and
all
the
habits
and
manners
that
are
important
;
equality
in
every
point
but
one
 
and
that
one
,
since
the
purity
of
her
heart
is
not
to
be
doubted
,
such
as
must
increase
his
felicity
,
for
it
will
be
his
to
bestow
the
only
advantages
she
wants
.
 
<EOS>
A
man
would
always
wish
to
give
a
woman
a
better
home
than
the
one
he
takes
her
from
;
and
he
who
can
do
it
,
where
there
is
no
doubt
of
_
her
_
regard
,
must
,
I
think
,
be
the
happiest
of
mortals
.
 
<EOS>
Frank
Churchill
is
,
indeed
,
the
favourite
of
fortune
.
<EOS>
Every
thing
turns
out
for
his
good
.
 
<EOS>
He
meets
with
a
young
woman
at
a
watering
-
place
,
gains
her
affection
,
can
not
even
weary
her
by
negligent
treatment
 
and
had
he
and
all
his
family
sought
round
the
world
for
a
perfect
wife
for
him
,
they
could
not
have
found
her
superior
.
 
<EOS>
His
aunt
is
in
the
way
.
 
<EOS>
His
aunt
dies
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
only
to
speak
.
 
<EOS>
His
friends
are
eager
to
promote
his
happiness
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
used
every
body
ill
 
<EOS>
and
they
are
all
delighted
to
forgive
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
a
fortunate
man
indeed
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
speak
as
if
you
envied
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
do
envy
him
,
Emma
.
<EOS>
In
one
respect
he
is
the
object
of
my
envy
.
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
could
say
no
more
.
<EOS>
They
seemed
to
be
within
half
a
sentence
of
Harriet
,
and
her
immediate
feeling
was
to
avert
the
subject
,
if
possible
.
<EOS>
She
made
her
plan
;
she
would
speak
of
something
totally
different
 
<EOS>
the
children
in
Brunswick
Square
;
and
she
only
waited
for
breath
to
begin
,
when
Mr.
Knightley
startled
her
,
by
saying
,
  
"
You
will
not
ask
me
what
is
the
point
of
envy
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
determined
,
I
see
,
to
have
no
curiosity
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
wise
 
<EOS>
but
_
I
_
can
not
be
wise
.
<EOS>
Emma
,
I
must
tell
you
what
you
will
not
ask
,
though
I
may
wish
it
unsaid
the
next
moment
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
then
,
do
n't
speak
it
,
do
n't
speak
it
,
"
she
eagerly
cried
.
<EOS>
"
Take
a
little
time
,
consider
,
do
not
commit
yourself
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
"
said
he
,
in
an
accent
of
deep
mortification
,
and
not
another
syllable
followed
.
  
<EOS>
Emma
could
not
bear
to
give
him
pain
.
<EOS>
He
was
wishing
to
confide
in
her
 
perhaps
to
consult
her
;
 
cost
her
what
it
would
,
she
would
listen
.
<EOS>
She
might
assist
his
resolution
,
or
reconcile
him
to
it
;
she
might
give
just
praise
to
Harriet
,
or
,
by
representing
to
him
his
own
independence
,
relieve
him
from
that
state
of
indecision
,
which
must
be
more
intolerable
than
any
alternative
to
such
a
mind
as
his
.
 
<EOS>
They
had
reached
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
going
in
,
I
suppose
?
"
said
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
 
replied
<EOS>
Emma
 
quite
confirmed
by
the
depressed
manner
in
which
he
still
spoke
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
to
take
another
turn
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Perry
is
not
gone
.
"
<EOS>
And
,
after
proceeding
a
few
steps
,
she
added
 
<EOS>
"
I
stopped
you
ungraciously
,
just
now
,
Mr.
Knightley
,
and
,
I
am
afraid
,
gave
you
pain
.
 
<EOS>
But
if
you
have
any
wish
to
speak
openly
to
me
as
a
friend
,
or
to
ask
my
opinion
of
any
thing
that
you
may
have
in
contemplation
 
as
a
friend
,
indeed
,
you
may
command
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
hear
whatever
you
like
.
<EOS>
I
will
tell
you
exactly
what
I
think
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
As
a
friend
!
"
 
<EOS>
repeated
Mr.
Knightley
.
 
<EOS>
"
Emma
,
that
I
fear
is
a
word
 
<EOS>
No
,
I
have
no
wish
 
<EOS>
Stay
,
yes
,
why
should
I
hesitate
?
 
<EOS>
I
have
gone
too
far
already
for
concealment
.
 
<EOS>
Emma
,
I
accept
your
offer
 
Extraordinary
as
it
may
seem
,
I
accept
it
,
and
refer
myself
to
you
as
a
friend
.
 
<EOS>
Tell
me
,
then
,
have
I
no
chance
of
ever
succeeding
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
stopped
in
his
earnestness
to
look
the
question
,
and
the
expression
of
his
eyes
overpowered
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dearest
Emma
,
"
said
he
,
"
<EOS>
for
dearest
you
will
always
be
,
<EOS>
whatever
the
event
of
this
hour
's
conversation
,
my
dearest
,
most
beloved
<EOS>
Emma
 
tell
me
at
once
.
<EOS>
Say
"
No
,
"
if
it
is
to
be
said
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
She
could
really
say
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
silent
,
"
he
cried
,
with
great
animation
;
"
absolutely
silent
!
<EOS>
at
present
I
ask
no
more
.
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
was
almost
ready
to
sink
under
the
agitation
of
this
moment
.
<EOS>
The
dread
of
being
awakened
from
the
happiest
dream
,
was
perhaps
the
most
prominent
feeling
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
make
speeches
,
Emma
:
"
he
soon
resumed
;
and
in
a
tone
of
such
sincere
,
decided
,
intelligible
tenderness
as
was
tolerably
convincing
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
I
loved
you
less
,
I
might
be
able
to
talk
about
it
more
.
<EOS>
But
you
know
what
I
am
.
 
<EOS>
You
hear
nothing
but
truth
from
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
blamed
you
,
and
lectured
you
,
and
you
have
borne
it
as
no
other
woman
in
England
would
have
borne
it
.
 
<EOS>
Bear
with
the
truths
<EOS>
I
would
tell
you
now
,
dearest
Emma
,
as
well
as
you
have
borne
with
them
.
<EOS>
The
manner
,
perhaps
,
may
have
as
little
to
recommend
them
.
<EOS>
God
knows
,
I
have
been
a
very
indifferent
lover
.
 
<EOS>
But
you
understand
me
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
you
see
,
you
understand
my
feelings
 
and
will
return
them
if
you
can
.
<EOS>
At
present
,
I
ask
only
to
hear
,
once
to
hear
your
voice
.
"
  
<EOS>
While
he
spoke
,
Emma
's
mind
was
most
busy
,
and
,
with
all
the
wonderful
velocity
of
thought
,
had
been
able
 
and
yet
without
losing
a
word
 
to
catch
and
comprehend
the
exact
truth
of
the
whole
;
to
see
that
Harriet
's
hopes
had
been
entirely
groundless
,
a
mistake
,
a
delusion
,
as
complete
a
delusion
as
any
of
her
own
 
that
Harriet
was
nothing
;
that
she
was
every
thing
herself
;
that
what
she
had
been
saying
relative
to
Harriet
had
been
all
taken
as
the
language
of
her
own
feelings
;
and
that
her
agitation
,
her
doubts
,
her
reluctance
,
her
discouragement
,
had
been
all
received
as
discouragement
from
herself
.
 
<EOS>
And
not
only
was
there
time
for
these
convictions
,
with
all
their
glow
of
attendant
happiness
;
there
was
time
also
to
rejoice
that
Harriet
's
secret
had
not
escaped
her
,
and
to
resolve
that
it
need
not
,
and
should
not
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
all
the
service
she
could
now
render
her
poor
friend
;
for
as
to
any
of
that
heroism
of
sentiment
which
might
have
prompted
her
to
entreat
him
to
transfer
his
affection
from
herself
to
Harriet
,
as
infinitely
the
most
worthy
of
the
two
 
or
even
the
more
simple
sublimity
of
resolving
to
refuse
him
at
once
and
for
ever
,
without
vouchsafing
any
motive
,
because
he
could
not
marry
them
both
,
Emma
had
it
not
.
<EOS>
She
felt
for
Harriet
,
with
pain
and
with
contrition
;
but
no
flight
of
generosity
run
mad
,
opposing
all
that
could
be
probable
or
reasonable
,
entered
her
brain
.
<EOS>
She
had
led
her
friend
astray
,
and
it
would
be
a
reproach
to
her
for
ever
;
but
her
judgment
was
as
strong
as
her
feelings
,
and
as
strong
as
it
had
ever
been
before
,
in
reprobating
any
such
alliance
for
him
,
as
most
unequal
and
degrading
.
<EOS>
Her
way
was
clear
,
though
not
quite
smooth
.
 
<EOS>
She
spoke
then
,
on
being
so
entreated
.
 
<EOS>
What
did
she
say
?
 
<EOS>
Just
what
she
ought
,
of
course
.
<EOS>
A
lady
always
does
.
 
<EOS>
She
said
enough
to
shew
there
need
not
be
despair
 
and
to
invite
him
to
say
more
himself
.
<EOS>
He
_
had
_
despaired
at
one
period
;
he
had
received
such
an
injunction
to
caution
and
silence
,
as
for
the
time
crushed
every
hope
;
 
she
had
begun
by
refusing
to
hear
him
.
 
<EOS>
The
change
had
perhaps
been
somewhat
sudden
;
 
her
proposal
of
taking
another
turn
,
her
renewing
the
conversation
which
she
had
just
put
an
end
to
,
might
be
a
little
extraordinary
!
 
<EOS>
She
felt
its
inconsistency
;
but
Mr.
Knightley
was
so
obliging
as
to
put
up
with
it
,
and
seek
no
farther
explanation
.
  
<EOS>
Seldom
,
very
seldom
,
does
complete
truth
belong
to
any
human
disclosure
;
seldom
can
it
happen
that
something
is
not
a
little
disguised
,
or
a
little
mistaken
;
but
where
,
as
in
this
case
,
though
the
conduct
is
mistaken
,
the
feelings
are
not
,
it
may
not
be
very
material
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Knightley
could
not
impute
to
Emma
a
more
relenting
heart
than
she
possessed
,
or
a
heart
more
disposed
to
accept
of
his
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
,
in
fact
,
been
wholly
unsuspicious
of
his
own
influence
.
<EOS>
He
had
followed
her
into
the
shrubbery
with
no
idea
of
trying
it
.
<EOS>
He
had
come
,
in
his
anxiety
to
see
how
she
bore
Frank
Churchill
's
engagement
,
with
no
selfish
view
,
no
view
at
all
,
but
of
endeavouring
,
if
she
allowed
him
an
opening
,
to
soothe
or
to
counsel
her
.
 
<EOS>
The
rest
had
been
the
work
of
the
moment
,
the
immediate
effect
of
what
he
heard
,
on
his
feelings
.
<EOS>
The
delightful
assurance
of
her
total
indifference
towards
Frank
Churchill
,
of
her
having
a
heart
completely
disengaged
from
him
,
had
given
birth
to
the
hope
,
that
,
in
time
,
he
might
gain
her
affection
himself
;
 
but
it
had
been
no
present
hope
 
<EOS>
he
had
only
,
in
the
momentary
conquest
of
eagerness
over
judgment
,
aspired
to
be
told
that
she
did
not
forbid
his
attempt
to
attach
her
.
 
<EOS>
The
superior
hopes
which
gradually
opened
were
so
much
the
more
enchanting
.
 
<EOS>
The
affection
,
which
he
had
been
asking
to
be
allowed
to
create
,
if
he
could
,
was
already
his
!
 
<EOS>
Within
half
an
hour
,
he
had
passed
from
a
thoroughly
distressed
state
of
mind
,
to
something
so
like
perfect
happiness
,
that
it
could
bear
no
other
name
.
  
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
Her
_
change
was
equal
.
 
<EOS>
This
one
half
-
hour
had
given
to
each
the
same
precious
certainty
of
being
beloved
,
had
cleared
from
each
the
same
degree
of
ignorance
,
jealousy
,
or
distrust
.
 
<EOS>
On
his
side
,
there
had
been
a
long
-
standing
jealousy
,
old
as
the
arrival
,
or
even
the
expectation
,
of
Frank
Churchill
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
been
in
love
with
Emma
,
and
jealous
of
Frank
Churchill
,
from
about
the
same
period
,
one
sentiment
having
probably
enlightened
him
as
to
the
other
.
<EOS>
It
was
his
jealousy
of
Frank
Churchill
that
had
taken
him
from
the
country
.
 
<EOS>
The
Box
Hill
party
had
decided
him
on
going
away
.
<EOS>
He
would
save
himself
from
witnessing
again
such
permitted
,
encouraged
attentions
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
gone
to
learn
to
be
indifferent
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
had
gone
to
a
wrong
place
.
<EOS>
There
was
too
much
domestic
happiness
in
his
brother
's
house
;
woman
wore
too
amiable
a
form
in
it
;
Isabella
was
too
much
like
Emma
 
differing
only
in
those
striking
inferiorities
,
which
always
brought
the
other
in
brilliancy
before
him
,
for
much
to
have
been
done
,
even
had
his
time
been
longer
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
stayed
on
,
however
,
vigorously
,
day
after
day
 
till
this
very
morning
's
post
had
conveyed
the
history
of
Jane
Fairfax
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
with
the
gladness
which
must
be
felt
,
nay
,
which
he
did
not
scruple
to
feel
,
having
never
believed
Frank
Churchill
to
be
at
all
deserving
Emma
,
was
there
so
much
fond
solicitude
,
so
much
keen
anxiety
for
her
,
that
he
could
stay
no
longer
.
<EOS>
He
had
ridden
home
through
the
rain
;
and
had
walked
up
directly
after
dinner
,
to
see
how
this
sweetest
and
best
of
all
creatures
,
faultless
in
spite
of
all
her
faults
,
bore
the
discovery
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
found
her
agitated
and
low
.
 
<EOS>
Frank
Churchill
was
a
villain
.
  
<EOS>
He
heard
her
declare
that
she
had
never
loved
him
.
<EOS>
Frank
Churchill
's
character
was
not
desperate
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
his
own
Emma
,
by
hand
and
word
,
when
they
returned
into
the
house
;
and
if
he
could
have
thought
of
Frank
Churchill
then
,
he
might
have
deemed
him
a
very
good
sort
of
fellow
.
    
<EOS>
What
totally
different
feelings
did
Emma
take
back
into
the
house
from
what
she
had
brought
out
!
 
<EOS>
she
had
then
been
only
daring
to
hope
for
a
little
respite
of
suffering
;
 
she
was
now
in
an
exquisite
flutter
of
happiness
,
and
such
happiness
moreover
as
she
believed
must
still
be
greater
when
the
flutter
should
have
passed
away
.
  
<EOS>
They
sat
down
to
tea
 
<EOS>
the
same
party
round
the
same
table
 
<EOS>
how
often
it
had
been
collected
!
 
<EOS>
and
how
often
had
her
eyes
fallen
on
the
same
shrubs
in
the
lawn
,
and
observed
the
same
beautiful
effect
of
the
western
sun
!
 
<EOS>
But
never
in
such
a
state
of
spirits
,
never
in
any
thing
like
it
;
and
it
was
with
difficulty
that
she
could
summon
enough
of
her
usual
self
to
be
the
attentive
lady
of
the
house
,
or
even
the
attentive
daughter
.
  
<EOS>
Poor
Mr.
Woodhouse
little
suspected
what
was
plotting
against
him
in
the
breast
of
that
man
whom
he
was
so
cordially
welcoming
,
and
so
anxiously
hoping
might
not
have
taken
cold
from
his
ride
.
 
<EOS>
Could
he
have
seen
the
heart
,
he
would
have
cared
very
little
for
the
lungs
;
but
without
the
most
distant
imagination
of
the
impending
evil
,
without
the
slightest
perception
of
any
thing
extraordinary
in
the
looks
or
ways
of
either
,
he
repeated
to
them
very
comfortably
all
the
articles
of
news
he
had
received
from
Mr.
Perry
,
and
talked
on
with
much
self
-
contentment
,
totally
unsuspicious
of
what
they
could
have
told
him
in
return
.
  
<EOS>
As
long
as
Mr.
Knightley
remained
with
them
,
Emma
's
fever
continued
;
but
when
he
was
gone
,
she
began
to
be
a
little
tranquillised
and
subdued
 
and
in
the
course
of
the
sleepless
night
,
which
was
the
tax
for
such
an
evening
,
she
found
one
or
two
such
very
serious
points
to
consider
,
as
made
her
feel
,
that
even
her
happiness
must
have
some
alloy
.
<EOS>
Her
father
 
and
Harriet
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
be
alone
without
feeling
the
full
weight
of
their
separate
claims
;
and
how
to
guard
the
comfort
of
both
to
the
utmost
,
was
the
question
.
<EOS>
With
respect
to
her
father
,
it
was
a
question
soon
answered
.
<EOS>
She
hardly
knew
yet
what
Mr.
Knightley
would
ask
;
but
a
very
short
parley
with
her
own
heart
produced
the
most
solemn
resolution
of
never
quitting
her
father
.
 
<EOS>
She
even
wept
over
the
idea
of
it
,
as
a
sin
of
thought
.
<EOS>
While
he
lived
,
it
must
be
only
an
engagement
;
but
she
flattered
herself
,
that
if
divested
of
the
danger
of
drawing
her
away
,
it
might
become
an
increase
of
comfort
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
How
to
do
her
best
by
Harriet
,
was
of
more
difficult
decision
;
 
how
to
spare
her
from
any
unnecessary
pain
;
how
to
make
her
any
possible
atonement
;
how
to
appear
least
her
enemy
?
 
<EOS>
On
these
subjects
,
her
perplexity
and
distress
were
very
great
 
<EOS>
and
her
mind
had
to
pass
again
and
again
through
every
bitter
reproach
and
sorrowful
regret
that
had
ever
surrounded
it
.
 
<EOS>
She
could
only
resolve
at
last
,
that
she
would
still
avoid
a
meeting
with
her
,
and
communicate
all
that
need
be
told
by
letter
;
that
it
would
be
inexpressibly
desirable
to
have
her
removed
just
now
for
a
time
from
Highbury
,
and
 
indulging
in
one
scheme
more
 
nearly
resolve
,
that
it
might
be
practicable
to
get
an
invitation
for
her
to
Brunswick
Square
.
 
<EOS>
Isabella
had
been
pleased
with
Harriet
;
and
a
few
weeks
spent
in
London
must
give
her
some
amusement
.
 
<EOS>
She
did
not
think
it
in
Harriet
's
nature
to
escape
being
benefited
by
novelty
and
variety
,
by
the
streets
,
the
shops
,
and
the
children
.
 
<EOS>
At
any
rate
,
it
would
be
a
proof
of
attention
and
kindness
in
herself
,
from
whom
every
thing
was
due
;
a
separation
for
the
present
;
an
averting
of
the
evil
day
,
when
they
must
all
be
together
again
.
  
<EOS>
She
rose
early
,
and
wrote
her
letter
to
Harriet
;
an
employment
which
left
her
so
very
serious
,
so
nearly
sad
,
that
Mr.
Knightley
,
in
walking
up
to
Hartfield
to
breakfast
,
did
not
arrive
at
all
too
soon
;
and
half
an
hour
stolen
afterwards
to
go
over
the
same
ground
again
with
him
,
literally
and
figuratively
,
was
quite
necessary
to
reinstate
her
in
a
proper
share
of
the
happiness
of
the
evening
before
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
not
left
her
long
,
by
no
means
long
enough
for
her
to
have
the
slightest
inclination
for
thinking
of
any
body
else
,
when
a
letter
was
brought
her
from
Randalls
 
a
very
thick
letter
;
 
she
guessed
what
it
must
contain
,
and
deprecated
the
necessity
of
reading
it
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
now
in
perfect
charity
with
Frank
Churchill
;
she
wanted
no
explanations
,
she
wanted
only
to
have
her
thoughts
to
herself
 
and
<EOS>
as
for
understanding
any
thing
he
wrote
,
she
was
sure
she
was
incapable
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
must
be
waded
through
,
however
.
<EOS>
She
opened
the
packet
;
it
was
too
surely
so
;
 
a
note
from
Mrs.
Weston
to
herself
,
ushered
in
the
letter
from
Frank
to
Mrs.
Weston
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
the
greatest
pleasure
,
my
dear
Emma
,
in
forwarding
to
you
the
enclosed
.
<EOS>
I
know
what
thorough
justice
you
will
do
it
,
and
have
scarcely
a
doubt
of
its
happy
effect
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
we
shall
never
materially
disagree
about
the
writer
again
;
but
I
will
not
delay
you
by
a
long
preface
.
 
<EOS>
We
are
quite
well
.
 
<EOS>
This
letter
has
been
the
cure
of
all
the
little
nervousness
I
have
been
feeling
lately
.
 
<EOS>
I
did
not
quite
like
your
looks
on
Tuesday
,
but
it
was
an
ungenial
morning
;
and
though
you
will
never
own
being
affected
by
weather
,
I
think
every
body
feels
a
north
-
east
wind
.
 
<EOS>
I
felt
for
your
dear
father
very
much
in
the
storm
of
Tuesday
afternoon
and
yesterday
morning
,
but
had
the
comfort
of
hearing
last
night
,
by
Mr.
Perry
,
that
it
had
not
made
him
ill
.

MY
DEAR
MADAM
,
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
made
myself
intelligible
yesterday
,
this
letter
will
be
expected
;
but
expected
or
not
,
I
know
it
will
be
read
with
candour
and
indulgence
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
all
goodness
,
and
I
believe
there
will
be
need
of
even
all
your
goodness
to
allow
for
some
parts
of
my
past
conduct
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
have
been
forgiven
by
one
who
had
still
more
to
resent
.
<EOS>
My
courage
rises
while
I
write
.
<EOS>
It
is
very
difficult
for
the
prosperous
to
be
humble
.
<EOS>
I
have
already
met
with
such
success
in
two
applications
for
pardon
,
that
I
may
be
in
danger
of
thinking
myself
too
sure
of
yours
,
and
of
those
among
your
friends
who
have
had
any
ground
of
offence
.
 
<EOS>
You
must
all
endeavour
to
comprehend
the
exact
nature
of
my
situation
when
I
first
arrived
at
Randalls
;
you
must
consider
me
as
having
a
secret
which
was
to
be
kept
at
all
hazards
.
<EOS>
This
was
the
fact
.
<EOS>
My
right
to
place
myself
in
a
situation
requiring
such
concealment
,
is
another
question
.
<EOS>
I
shall
not
discuss
it
here
.
<EOS>
For
my
temptation
to
_
think
_
<EOS>
it
a
right
<EOS>
,
I
refer
every
caviller
to
a
brick
house
,
sashed
windows
below
,
and
casements
above
,
in
Highbury
.
<EOS>
I
dared
not
address
her
openly
;
my
difficulties
in
the
then
state
of
Enscombe
must
be
too
well
known
to
require
definition
;
and
I
was
fortunate
enough
to
prevail
,
before
we
parted
at
Weymouth
,
and
to
induce
the
most
upright
female
mind
in
the
creation
to
stoop
in
charity
to
a
secret
engagement
.
 
<EOS>
Had
she
refused
,
I
should
have
gone
mad
.
 
<EOS>
But
you
will
be
ready
to
say
,
what
was
your
hope
in
doing
this
?
 
<EOS>
What
did
you
look
forward
to
?
 
<EOS>
To
any
thing
,
every
thing
 
to
time
,
chance
,
circumstance
,
slow
effects
,
sudden
bursts
,
perseverance
and
weariness
,
health
and
sickness
.
<EOS>
Every
possibility
of
good
was
before
me
,
and
the
first
of
blessings
secured
,
in
obtaining
her
promises
of
faith
and
correspondence
.
<EOS>
If
you
need
farther
explanation
,
I
have
the
honour
,
my
dear
madam
,
of
being
your
husband
's
son
,
and
the
advantage
of
inheriting
a
disposition
to
hope
for
good
,
which
no
inheritance
of
houses
or
lands
can
ever
equal
the
value
of
.
 
<EOS>
See
me
,
then
,
under
these
circumstances
,
arriving
on
my
first
visit
to
Randalls
;
 
and
here
I
am
conscious
of
wrong
,
for
that
visit
might
have
been
sooner
paid
.
<EOS>
You
will
look
back
and
see
that
I
did
not
come
till
Miss
Fairfax
was
in
Highbury
;
and
as
_
you
_
were
the
person
slighted
,
you
will
forgive
me
instantly
;
but
I
must
work
on
my
father
's
compassion
,
by
reminding
him
,
that
so
long
as
I
absented
myself
from
his
house
,
so
long
I
lost
the
blessing
of
knowing
you
.
<EOS>
My
behaviour
,
during
the
very
happy
fortnight
which
I
spent
with
you
,
did
not
,
I
hope
,
lay
me
open
to
reprehension
,
excepting
on
one
point
.
<EOS>
And
now
I
come
to
the
principal
,
the
only
important
part
of
my
conduct
while
belonging
to
you
,
which
excites
my
own
anxiety
,
or
requires
very
solicitous
explanation
.
<EOS>
With
the
greatest
respect
,
and
the
warmest
friendship
,
do
I
mention
Miss
Woodhouse
;
my
father
perhaps
will
think
I
ought
to
add
,
with
the
deepest
humiliation
.
 
<EOS>
A
few
words
which
dropped
from
him
yesterday
spoke
his
opinion
,
and
some
censure
I
acknowledge
myself
liable
to
.
 
<EOS>
My
behaviour
to
Miss
Woodhouse
indicated
,
I
believe
,
more
than
it
ought
.
 
<EOS>
In
order
to
assist
a
concealment
so
essential
to
me
,
I
was
led
on
to
make
more
than
an
allowable
use
of
the
sort
of
intimacy
into
which
we
were
immediately
thrown
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
deny
that
Miss
Woodhouse
was
my
ostensible
object
 
<EOS>
but
I
am
sure
you
will
believe
the
declaration
,
that
had
I
not
been
convinced
of
her
indifference
,
I
would
not
have
been
induced
by
any
selfish
views
to
go
on
.
 
<EOS>
Amiable
and
delightful
as
Miss
Woodhouse
is
<EOS>
,
she
never
gave
me
the
idea
of
a
young
woman
likely
to
be
attached
;
and
that
she
was
perfectly
free
from
any
tendency
to
being
attached
to
me
,
was
as
much
my
conviction
as
my
wish
.
 
<EOS>
She
received
my
attentions
with
an
easy
,
friendly
,
goodhumoured
playfulness
,
which
exactly
suited
me
.
<EOS>
We
seemed
to
understand
each
other
.
<EOS>
From
our
relative
situation
,
those
attentions
were
her
due
,
and
were
felt
to
be
so
.
 
<EOS>
Whether
Miss
Woodhouse
began
really
to
understand
me
before
the
expiration
of
that
fortnight
,
I
can
not
say
;
 
when
I
called
to
take
leave
of
her
,
I
remember
that
I
was
within
a
moment
of
confessing
the
truth
,
and
I
then
fancied
she
was
not
without
suspicion
;
but
I
have
no
doubt
of
her
having
since
detected
me
,
at
least
in
some
degree
.
 
<EOS>
She
may
not
have
surmised
the
whole
,
but
her
quickness
must
have
penetrated
a
part
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
doubt
it
.
<EOS>
You
will
find
,
whenever
the
subject
becomes
freed
from
its
present
restraints
,
that
it
did
not
take
her
wholly
by
surprize
.
<EOS>
She
frequently
gave
me
hints
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
remember
her
telling
me
at
the
ball
,
that
I
owed
Mrs.
Elton
gratitude
for
her
attentions
to
Miss
Fairfax
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
this
history
of
my
conduct
towards
her
will
be
admitted
by
you
and
my
father
as
great
extenuation
of
what
you
saw
amiss
.
<EOS>
While
you
considered
me
as
having
sinned
against
Emma
Woodhouse
,
I
could
deserve
nothing
from
either
.
<EOS>
Acquit
me
here
,
and
procure
for
me
,
when
it
is
allowable
,
the
acquittal
and
good
wishes
of
that
said
Emma
Woodhouse
,
whom
I
regard
with
so
much
brotherly
affection
,
as
to
long
to
have
her
as
deeply
and
as
happily
in
love
as
myself
.
 
<EOS>
Whatever
strange
things
<EOS>
I
said
or
did
during
that
fortnight
<EOS>
,
you
have
now
a
key
to
.
<EOS>
My
heart
was
in
Highbury
,
and
my
business
was
to
get
my
body
thither
as
often
as
might
be
,
and
with
the
least
suspicion
.
<EOS>
If
you
remember
any
queernesses
,
set
them
all
to
the
right
account
.
 
<EOS>
Of
the
pianoforte
so
much
talked
of
,
I
feel
it
only
necessary
to
say
,
that
its
being
ordered
was
absolutely
unknown
to
Miss
F
 
<EOS>
,
who
would
never
have
allowed
me
to
send
it
,
had
any
choice
been
given
her
.
 
<EOS>
The
delicacy
of
her
mind
throughout
the
whole
engagement
,
my
dear
madam
,
is
much
beyond
my
power
of
doing
justice
to
.
<EOS>
You
will
soon
,
I
earnestly
hope
,
know
her
thoroughly
yourself
.
 
<EOS>
No
description
can
describe
her
.
<EOS>
She
must
tell
you
herself
what
she
is
 
yet
not
by
word
,
for
never
was
there
a
human
creature
who
would
so
designedly
suppress
her
own
merit
.
 
<EOS>
Since
I
began
this
letter
,
which
will
be
longer
than
I
foresaw
,
I
have
heard
from
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
gives
a
good
account
of
her
own
health
;
but
as
she
never
complains
,
I
dare
not
depend
.
<EOS>
I
want
to
have
your
opinion
of
her
looks
.
<EOS>
I
know
you
will
soon
call
on
her
;
she
is
living
in
dread
of
the
visit
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
it
is
paid
already
.
<EOS>
Let
me
hear
from
you
without
delay
;
I
am
impatient
for
a
thousand
particulars
.
<EOS>
Remember
how
few
minutes
I
was
at
Randalls
,
and
in
how
bewildered
,
how
mad
a
state
:
and
I
am
not
much
better
yet
;
still
insane
either
from
happiness
or
misery
.
<EOS>
When
I
think
of
the
kindness
and
favour
I
have
met
with
,
of
her
excellence
and
patience
,
and
my
uncle
's
generosity
,
I
am
mad
with
joy
:
but
when
I
recollect
all
the
uneasiness
I
occasioned
her
,
and
how
little
I
deserve
to
be
forgiven
,
I
am
mad
with
anger
.
<EOS>
If
I
could
but
see
her
again
!
 
<EOS>
But
I
must
not
propose
it
yet
.
<EOS>
My
uncle
has
been
too
good
for
me
to
encroach
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
still
add
to
this
long
letter
.
<EOS>
You
have
not
heard
all
that
you
ought
to
hear
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
give
any
connected
detail
yesterday
;
but
the
suddenness
,
and
,
in
one
light
,
the
unseasonableness
with
which
the
affair
burst
out
,
needs
explanation
;
for
though
the
event
of
the
26th
ult
.
,
as
you
will
conclude
,
immediately
opened
to
me
the
happiest
prospects
<EOS>
,
I
should
not
have
presumed
on
such
early
measures
,
but
from
the
very
particular
circumstances
,
which
left
me
not
an
hour
to
lose
.
<EOS>
I
should
myself
have
shrunk
from
any
thing
so
hasty
,
and
she
would
have
felt
every
scruple
of
mine
with
multiplied
strength
and
refinement
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
had
no
choice
.
<EOS>
The
hasty
engagement
she
had
entered
into
with
that
woman
 
<EOS>
Here
,
my
dear
madam
,
I
was
obliged
to
leave
off
abruptly
,
to
recollect
and
compose
myself
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
walking
over
the
country
,
and
am
now
,
I
hope
,
rational
enough
to
make
the
rest
of
my
letter
what
it
ought
to
be
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
,
in
fact
,
a
most
mortifying
retrospect
for
me
.
<EOS>
I
behaved
shamefully
.
<EOS>
And
here
I
can
admit
,
that
my
manners
to
Miss
W.
,
in
being
unpleasant
to
Miss
F.
,
were
highly
blameable
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
She
_
disapproved
them
,
which
ought
to
have
been
enough
.
 
<EOS>
My
plea
of
concealing
the
truth
she
did
not
think
sufficient
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
displeased
;
I
thought
unreasonably
so
:
I
thought
her
,
on
a
thousand
occasions
,
unnecessarily
scrupulous
and
cautious
:
I
thought
her
even
cold
.
<EOS>
But
she
was
always
right
.
<EOS>
If
I
had
followed
her
judgment
,
and
subdued
my
spirits
to
the
level
of
what
she
deemed
proper
,
I
should
have
escaped
the
greatest
unhappiness
I
have
ever
known
.
 
<EOS>
We
quarrelled
.
  
<EOS>
Do
you
remember
the
morning
spent
at
Donwell
?
 
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
There
_
<EOS>
every
little
dissatisfaction
that
had
occurred
before
came
to
a
crisis
.
<EOS>
I
was
late
;
I
met
her
walking
home
by
herself
,
and
wanted
to
walk
with
her
,
but
she
would
not
suffer
it
.
<EOS>
She
absolutely
refused
to
allow
me
,
which
I
then
thought
most
unreasonable
.
<EOS>
Now
,
however
,
I
see
nothing
in
it
but
a
very
natural
and
consistent
degree
of
discretion
.
<EOS>
While
I
,
to
blind
the
world
to
our
engagement
,
was
behaving
one
hour
with
objectionable
particularity
to
another
woman
,
was
she
to
be
consenting
the
next
to
a
proposal
which
might
have
made
every
previous
caution
useless
?
 
<EOS>
Had
we
been
met
walking
together
between
Donwell
and
Highbury
,
the
truth
must
have
been
suspected
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
mad
enough
,
however
,
to
resent
.
 
<EOS>
I
doubted
her
affection
.
<EOS>
I
doubted
it
more
the
next
day
on
Box
Hill
;
when
,
provoked
by
such
conduct
on
my
side
,
such
shameful
,
insolent
neglect
of
her
,
and
such
apparent
devotion
to
Miss
W.
,
as
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
any
woman
of
sense
to
endure
,
she
spoke
her
resentment
in
a
form
of
words
perfectly
intelligible
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
In
short
,
my
dear
madam
,
it
was
a
quarrel
blameless
on
her
side
,
abominable
on
mine
;
and
I
returned
the
same
evening
to
Richmond
,
though
I
might
have
staid
with
you
till
the
next
morning
,
merely
because
I
would
be
as
angry
with
her
as
possible
.
<EOS>
Even
then
,
I
was
not
such
a
fool
as
not
to
mean
to
be
reconciled
in
time
;
but
I
was
the
injured
person
,
injured
by
her
coldness
,
and
I
went
away
<EOS>
determined
that
she
should
make
the
first
advances
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
always
congratulate
myself
that
you
were
not
of
the
Box
Hill
party
.
<EOS>
Had
you
witnessed
my
behaviour
there
<EOS>
,
I
can
hardly
suppose
you
would
ever
have
thought
well
of
me
again
.
<EOS>
Its
effect
upon
her
appears
in
the
immediate
resolution
it
produced
:
as
soon
as
she
found
I
was
really
gone
from
Randalls
,
she
closed
with
the
offer
of
that
officious
Mrs.
Elton
;
the
whole
system
of
whose
treatment
of
her
,
by
the
bye
,
has
ever
filled
me
with
indignation
and
hatred
.
<EOS>
I
must
not
quarrel
with
a
spirit
of
forbearance
which
has
been
so
richly
extended
towards
myself
;
but
,
otherwise
,
I
should
loudly
protest
against
the
share
of
it
which
that
woman
has
known
.
 
<EOS>
"
Jane
,
"
indeed
!
 
<EOS>
You
will
observe
that
I
have
not
yet
indulged
myself
in
calling
her
by
that
name
,
even
to
you
.
<EOS>
Think
,
then
,
what
I
must
have
endured
in
hearing
it
bandied
between
the
Eltons
with
all
the
vulgarity
of
needless
repetition
,
and
all
the
insolence
of
imaginary
superiority
.
<EOS>
Have
patience
with
me
,
I
shall
soon
have
done
.
 
<EOS>
She
closed
with
this
offer
,
resolving
to
break
with
me
entirely
,
and
wrote
the
next
day
to
tell
me
that
we
never
were
to
meet
again
.
 
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
She
_
_
felt
_
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
the
_
_
engagement
_
_
<EOS>
to
_
_
be
_
_
<EOS>
a
_
_
source
_
_
of
_
_
repentance
_
_
and
<EOS>
_
_
misery
_
_
to
_
_
<EOS>
each
_
:
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
she
<EOS>
_
_
dissolved
_
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
it
<EOS>
_
.
 
<EOS>
This
letter
reached
me
on
the
very
morning
of
my
poor
aunt
's
death
.
<EOS>
I
answered
it
within
an
hour
;
but
from
the
confusion
of
my
mind
,
and
the
multiplicity
of
business
falling
on
me
at
once
,
my
answer
,
instead
of
being
sent
with
all
the
many
other
letters
of
that
day
,
was
locked
up
in
my
writing
-
desk
;
and
I
,
trusting
that
I
had
written
enough
,
though
but
a
few
lines
,
to
satisfy
her
,
remained
without
any
uneasiness
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
rather
disappointed
that
I
did
not
hear
from
her
again
speedily
;
but
I
made
excuses
for
her
,
and
was
too
busy
,
and
 
may
I
add
?
 
<EOS>
too
cheerful
in
my
views
to
be
captious
.
 
<EOS>
We
removed
to
Windsor
;
and
two
days
afterwards
I
received
a
parcel
from
her
,
my
own
letters
all
returned
!
 
<EOS>
and
a
few
lines
at
the
same
time
by
the
post
,
stating
her
extreme
surprize
at
not
having
had
the
smallest
reply
to
her
last
;
and
adding
,
that
as
silence
on
such
a
point
could
not
be
misconstrued
,
<EOS>
and
as
it
must
be
equally
desirable
to
both
to
have
every
subordinate
arrangement
concluded
as
soon
as
possible
,
she
now
sent
me
,
by
a
safe
conveyance
,
all
my
letters
,
and
requested
,
that
if
I
could
not
directly
command
hers
,
so
as
to
send
them
to
Highbury
within
a
week
,
I
would
forward
them
after
that
period
to
her
at
 
:
in
short
,
the
full
direction
to
Mr.
Smallridge
's
,
near
Bristol
,
stared
me
in
the
face
.
<EOS>
I
knew
the
name
,
the
place
,
I
knew
all
about
it
,
and
instantly
saw
what
she
had
been
doing
.
<EOS>
It
was
perfectly
accordant
with
that
resolution
of
character
which
I
knew
her
to
possess
;
and
the
secrecy
she
had
maintained
,
as
to
any
such
design
in
her
former
letter
,
was
equally
descriptive
of
its
anxious
delicacy
.
<EOS>
For
the
world
would
not
she
have
seemed
to
threaten
me
.
 
<EOS>
Imagine
the
shock
<EOS>
;
imagine
how
,
till
I
had
actually
detected
my
own
blunder
,
I
raved
at
the
blunders
of
the
post
.
 
<EOS>
What
was
to
be
done
?
 
<EOS>
One
thing
only
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
speak
to
my
uncle
.
<EOS>
Without
his
sanction
I
could
not
hope
to
be
listened
to
again
.
 
<EOS>
I
spoke
;
circumstances
were
in
my
favour
;
the
late
event
had
softened
away
his
pride
,
and
he
was
,
earlier
than
I
could
have
anticipated
,
wholly
reconciled
and
complying
;
and
could
say
at
last
,
poor
man
!
<EOS>
with
a
deep
sigh
,
that
he
wished
I
might
find
as
much
happiness
in
the
marriage
state
as
he
had
done
.
 
<EOS>
I
felt
that
it
would
be
of
a
different
sort
.
 
<EOS>
Are
you
disposed
to
pity
me
for
what
I
must
have
suffered
in
opening
the
cause
to
him
,
for
my
suspense
while
all
was
at
stake
?
 
<EOS>
No
;
do
not
pity
me
till
I
reached
Highbury
,
and
saw
how
ill
I
had
made
her
.
<EOS>
Do
not
pity
me
till
I
saw
her
wan
,
sick
looks
.
 
<EOS>
I
reached
Highbury
at
the
time
of
day
when
,
from
my
knowledge
of
their
late
breakfast
hour
,
I
was
certain
of
a
good
chance
of
finding
her
alone
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
not
disappointed
;
and
at
last
I
was
not
disappointed
either
in
the
object
of
my
journey
.
<EOS>
A
great
deal
of
very
reasonable
,
very
just
displeasure
I
had
to
persuade
away
.
<EOS>
But
it
is
done
;
we
are
reconciled
,
dearer
,
much
dearer
,
than
ever
,
and
no
moment
's
uneasiness
can
ever
occur
between
us
again
.
<EOS>
Now
,
my
dear
madam
,
I
will
release
you
;
but
I
could
not
conclude
before
.
<EOS>
A
thousand
and
a
thousand
thanks
for
all
the
kindness
you
have
ever
shewn
me
,
and
ten
thousand
for
the
attentions
your
heart
will
dictate
towards
her
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
think
me
in
a
way
to
be
happier
than
I
deserve
,
I
am
quite
of
your
opinion
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
W.
calls
me
the
child
of
good
fortune
.
<EOS>
I
hope
she
is
right
.
 
<EOS>
In
one
respect
,
my
good
fortune
is
undoubted
,
that
of
being
able
to
subscribe
myself
,
  
Your
obliged
and
affectionate
Son
,
  
F.
C.
WESTON
CHURCHILL
.
    
<EOS>
This
letter
must
make
its
way
to
Emma
's
feelings
.
<EOS>
She
was
obliged
,
in
spite
of
her
previous
determination
to
the
contrary
,
to
do
it
all
the
justice
that
Mrs.
Weston
foretold
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
she
came
to
her
own
name
,
it
was
irresistible
;
every
line
relating
to
herself
was
interesting
,
and
almost
every
line
agreeable
;
and
when
this
charm
ceased
,
the
subject
could
still
maintain
itself
,
by
the
natural
return
of
her
former
regard
for
the
writer
,
and
the
very
strong
attraction
which
any
picture
of
love
must
have
for
her
at
that
moment
.
<EOS>
She
never
stopt
till
she
had
gone
through
the
whole
;
and
though
it
was
impossible
not
to
feel
that
he
had
been
wrong
,
yet
he
had
been
less
wrong
than
she
had
supposed
 
<EOS>
and
he
had
suffered
,
and
was
very
sorry
 
<EOS>
and
he
was
so
grateful
to
Mrs.
Weston
,
and
so
much
in
love
with
Miss
Fairfax
,
and
she
was
so
happy
herself
,
that
there
was
no
being
severe
;
and
could
he
have
entered
the
room
<EOS>
,
she
must
have
shaken
hands
with
him
as
heartily
as
ever
.
  
<EOS>
She
thought
so
well
of
the
letter
,
that
when
Mr.
Knightley
came
again
,
she
desired
him
to
read
it
.
<EOS>
She
was
sure
of
Mrs.
Weston
's
wishing
it
to
be
communicated
;
especially
to
one
,
who
,
like
Mr.
Knightley
,
had
seen
so
much
to
blame
in
his
conduct
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
very
glad
to
look
it
over
,
"
said
he
;
"
but
it
seems
long
.
<EOS>
I
will
take
it
home
with
me
at
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
But
that
would
not
do
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Weston
was
to
call
in
the
evening
,
and
she
must
return
it
by
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
rather
be
talking
to
you
,
"
he
replied
;
"
but
as
it
seems
a
matter
of
justice
,
it
shall
be
done
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
began
 
stopping
,
however
,
almost
directly
to
say
,
"
Had
I
been
offered
the
sight
of
one
of
this
gentleman
's
letters
to
his
mother
-
in
-
law
a
few
months
ago
,
Emma
,
it
would
not
have
been
taken
with
such
indifference
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
proceeded
a
little
farther
,
reading
to
himself
;
and
then
,
with
a
smile
,
observed
,
"
Humph
!
<EOS>
a
fine
complimentary
opening
:
<EOS>
But
it
is
his
way
.
<EOS>
One
man
's
style
must
not
be
the
rule
of
another
's
.
<EOS>
We
will
not
be
severe
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
will
be
natural
for
me
,
"
he
added
shortly
afterwards
,
"
to
speak
my
opinion
aloud
as
I
read
.
<EOS>
By
doing
it
,
I
shall
feel
that
I
am
near
you
.
<EOS>
It
will
not
be
so
great
a
loss
of
time
:
but
if
you
dislike
it
 
"
  
"
Not
at
all
.
<EOS>
I
should
wish
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Knightley
returned
to
his
reading
with
greater
alacrity
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
trifles
here
,
"
said
he
,
"
as
to
the
temptation
.
<EOS>
He
knows
he
is
wrong
,
and
has
nothing
rational
to
urge
.
 
<EOS>
Bad
.
 
<EOS>
He
ought
not
to
have
formed
the
engagement
.
 
<EOS>
"
His
father
's
disposition
:
"
 
<EOS>
he
is
unjust
,
however
,
to
his
father
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Weston
's
sanguine
temper
was
a
blessing
on
all
his
upright
and
honourable
exertions
;
but
Mr.
Weston
earned
every
present
comfort
before
he
endeavoured
to
gain
it
.
 
<EOS>
Very
true
;
he
did
not
come
till
Miss
Fairfax
was
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
I
have
not
forgotten
,
"
said
Emma
,
"
how
sure
you
were
that
he
might
have
come
sooner
if
he
would
.
<EOS>
You
pass
it
over
very
handsomely
 
<EOS>
but
you
were
perfectly
right
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
not
quite
impartial
in
my
judgment
,
Emma
:
 
<EOS>
but
yet
,
I
think
 
had
_
<EOS>
you
_
not
been
in
the
case
 
<EOS>
I
should
still
have
distrusted
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
When
he
came
to
Miss
Woodhouse
,
he
was
obliged
to
read
the
whole
of
it
aloud
 
all
that
related
to
her
,
with
a
smile
;
a
look
;
a
shake
of
the
head
;
a
word
or
two
of
assent
,
or
disapprobation
;
or
merely
of
love
,
as
the
subject
required
;
concluding
,
however
,
seriously
,
and
,
after
steady
reflection
,
thus
    
"
Very
bad
 
though
it
might
have
been
worse
.
 
<EOS>
Playing
a
most
dangerous
game
.
<EOS>
Too
much
indebted
to
the
event
for
his
acquittal
.
 
<EOS>
No
judge
of
his
own
manners
by
you
.
 
<EOS>
Always
deceived
in
fact
by
his
own
wishes
,
and
regardless
of
little
besides
his
own
convenience
.
 
<EOS>
Fancying
you
to
have
fathomed
his
secret
.
<EOS>
Natural
enough
!
 
<EOS>
his
own
mind
full
of
intrigue
<EOS>
,
that
he
should
suspect
it
in
others
.
 
<EOS>
Mystery
;
Finesse
 
<EOS>
how
they
pervert
the
understanding
!
<EOS>
My
Emma
,
does
not
every
thing
serve
to
prove
more
and
more
the
beauty
of
truth
and
sincerity
in
all
our
dealings
with
each
other
?
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
agreed
to
it
,
and
with
a
blush
of
sensibility
on
Harriet
's
account
,
which
she
could
not
give
any
sincere
explanation
of
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
had
better
go
on
,
"
said
she
.
  
<EOS>
He
did
so
,
but
very
soon
stopt
again
to
say
,
"
the
pianoforte
!
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
That
was
the
act
of
a
very
,
very
young
man
,
one
too
young
to
consider
whether
the
inconvenience
of
it
might
not
very
much
exceed
the
pleasure
.
<EOS>
A
boyish
scheme
,
indeed
!
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
comprehend
a
man
's
wishing
to
give
a
woman
any
proof
of
affection
which
he
knows
she
would
rather
dispense
with
;
and
he
did
know
that
she
would
have
prevented
the
instrument
's
coming
if
she
could
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
After
this
,
he
made
some
progress
without
any
pause
.
<EOS>
Frank
Churchill
's
confession
of
having
behaved
shamefully
was
the
first
thing
to
call
for
more
than
a
word
in
passing
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
perfectly
agree
with
you
,
sir
,
"
 
was
then
his
remark
.
<EOS>
"
You
did
behave
very
shamefully
.
<EOS>
You
never
wrote
a
truer
line
.
"
<EOS>
And
having
gone
through
what
immediately
followed
of
the
basis
of
their
disagreement
,
and
his
persisting
to
act
in
direct
opposition
to
Jane
Fairfax
's
sense
of
right
,
he
made
a
fuller
pause
to
say
,
"
This
is
very
bad
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
induced
her
to
place
herself
,
for
his
sake
,
in
a
situation
of
extreme
difficulty
and
uneasiness
,
and
it
should
have
been
his
first
object
to
prevent
her
from
suffering
unnecessarily
.
 
<EOS>
She
must
have
had
much
more
to
contend
with
,
in
carrying
on
the
correspondence
,
than
he
could
.
<EOS>
He
should
have
respected
even
unreasonable
scruples
,
had
there
been
such
;
but
hers
were
all
reasonable
.
<EOS>
We
must
look
to
her
one
fault
,
and
remember
that
she
had
done
a
wrong
thing
in
consenting
to
the
engagement
,
to
bear
that
she
should
have
been
in
such
a
state
of
punishment
.
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
knew
that
he
was
now
getting
to
the
Box
Hill
party
,
and
grew
uncomfortable
.
<EOS>
Her
own
behaviour
had
been
so
very
improper
!
<EOS>
She
was
deeply
ashamed
,
and
a
little
afraid
of
his
next
look
.
<EOS>
It
was
all
read
,
however
,
steadily
,
attentively
,
and
without
the
smallest
remark
;
and
,
excepting
one
momentary
glance
at
her
,
instantly
withdrawn
,
in
the
fear
of
giving
pain
 
no
remembrance
of
Box
Hill
seemed
to
exist
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
no
saying
much
for
the
delicacy
of
our
good
friends
,
the
Eltons
,
"
was
his
next
observation
.
 
<EOS>
"
His
feelings
are
natural
.
 
<EOS>
What
!
<EOS>
actually
resolve
to
break
with
him
entirely
!
 
<EOS>
She
felt
the
engagement
to
be
a
source
of
repentance
and
misery
to
each
 
<EOS>
she
dissolved
it
.
 
<EOS>
What
a
view
this
gives
of
her
sense
of
his
behaviour
!
 
<EOS>
Well
,
he
must
be
a
most
extraordinary
 
"
  
"
Nay
,
nay
,
read
on
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
find
how
very
much
he
suffers
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
he
does
,
"
replied
Mr.
Knightley
coolly
,
and
resuming
the
letter
.
"
<EOS>
"
Smallridge
!
"
 
<EOS>
What
does
this
mean
?
<EOS>
What
is
all
this
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
had
engaged
to
go
as
governess
to
Mrs.
Smallridge
's
children
 
a
dear
friend
of
Mrs.
Elton
's
 
a
neighbour
of
Maple
Grove
;
and
,
by
the
bye
,
I
wonder
how
Mrs.
Elton
bears
the
disappointment
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Say
nothing
,
my
dear
Emma
,
while
you
oblige
me
to
read
 
not
even
of
Mrs.
Elton
.
<EOS>
Only
one
page
more
.
<EOS>
I
shall
soon
have
done
.
<EOS>
What
a
letter
the
man
writes
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
you
would
read
it
with
a
kinder
spirit
towards
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
there
_
is
_
feeling
here
.
 
<EOS>
He
does
seem
to
have
suffered
in
finding
her
ill
.
 
<EOS>
Certainly
,
I
can
have
no
doubt
of
his
being
fond
of
her
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Dearer
,
much
dearer
than
ever
.
<EOS>
"
I
hope
he
may
long
continue
to
feel
all
the
value
of
such
a
reconciliation
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
a
very
liberal
thanker
,
with
his
thousands
and
tens
of
thousands
.
 
<EOS>
"
Happier
than
I
deserve
.
<EOS>
"
Come
,
he
knows
himself
there
.
"
<EOS>
Miss
Woodhouse
calls
me
the
child
of
good
fortune
.
"
 
<EOS>
Those
were
Miss
Woodhouse
's
words
,
were
they
?
  
<EOS>
And
a
fine
ending
 
<EOS>
and
there
is
the
letter
.
<EOS>
The
child
of
good
fortune
!
<EOS>
That
was
your
name
for
him
,
was
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
appear
so
well
satisfied
with
his
letter
as
I
am
;
but
still
you
must
,
at
least
I
hope
you
must
,
think
the
better
of
him
for
it
.
<EOS>
I
hope
it
does
him
some
service
with
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
certainly
it
does
.
<EOS>
He
has
had
great
faults
,
faults
of
inconsideration
and
thoughtlessness
;
and
I
am
very
much
of
his
opinion
in
thinking
him
likely
to
be
happier
than
he
deserves
:
but
still
as
he
is
,
beyond
a
doubt
,
really
attached
to
Miss
Fairfax
,
and
will
soon
,
it
may
be
hoped
,
have
the
advantage
of
being
constantly
with
her
,
I
am
very
ready
to
believe
his
character
will
improve
,
and
acquire
from
hers
the
steadiness
and
delicacy
of
principle
that
it
wants
.
<EOS>
And
now
,
let
me
talk
to
you
of
something
else
.
<EOS>
I
have
another
person
's
interest
at
present
so
much
at
heart
,
that
I
can
not
think
any
longer
about
Frank
Churchill
.
<EOS>
Ever
since
I
left
you
this
morning
,
Emma
,
my
mind
has
been
hard
at
work
on
one
subject
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
subject
followed
;
it
was
in
plain
,
unaffected
,
gentlemanlike
English
,
such
as
Mr.
Knightley
used
even
to
the
woman
he
was
in
love
with
,
how
to
be
able
to
ask
her
to
marry
him
,
without
attacking
the
happiness
of
her
father
.
<EOS>
Emma
's
answer
was
ready
at
the
first
word
.
"
<EOS>
While
her
dear
father
lived
,
any
change
of
condition
must
be
impossible
for
her
.
<EOS>
She
could
never
quit
him
.
<EOS>
"
Part
only
of
this
answer
,
however
,
was
admitted
.
<EOS>
The
impossibility
of
her
quitting
her
father
,
Mr.
Knightley
felt
as
strongly
as
herself
;
but
the
inadmissibility
of
any
other
change
,
he
could
not
agree
to
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
thinking
it
over
most
deeply
,
most
intently
;
he
had
at
first
hoped
to
induce
Mr.
Woodhouse
to
remove
with
her
to
Donwell
;
he
had
wanted
to
believe
it
feasible
,
but
his
knowledge
of
Mr.
Woodhouse
would
not
suffer
him
to
deceive
himself
long
;
and
now
he
confessed
his
persuasion
,
that
such
a
transplantation
would
be
a
risk
of
her
father
's
comfort
,
perhaps
even
of
his
life
,
which
must
not
be
hazarded
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Woodhouse
taken
from
Hartfield
!
 
<EOS>
No
,
he
felt
that
it
ought
not
to
be
attempted
.
<EOS>
But
the
plan
which
had
arisen
on
the
sacrifice
of
this
,
he
trusted
his
dearest
<EOS>
Emma
would
not
find
in
any
respect
objectionable
;
it
was
,
that
he
should
be
received
at
Hartfield
;
that
so
long
as
her
father
's
happiness
in
other
words
his
life
 
required
Hartfield
to
continue
her
home
,
it
should
be
his
likewise
.
  
<EOS>
Of
their
all
removing
to
Donwell
,
Emma
had
already
had
her
own
passing
thoughts
.
<EOS>
Like
him
,
she
had
tried
the
scheme
and
rejected
it
;
but
such
an
alternative
as
this
had
not
occurred
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
was
sensible
of
all
the
affection
it
evinced
.
<EOS>
She
felt
that
,
in
quitting
Donwell
,
he
must
be
sacrificing
a
great
deal
of
independence
of
hours
and
habits
;
that
in
living
constantly
with
her
father
,
and
in
no
house
of
his
own
,
there
would
be
much
,
very
much
,
to
be
borne
with
.
<EOS>
She
promised
to
think
of
it
,
and
advised
him
to
think
of
it
more
;
but
he
was
fully
convinced
,
that
no
reflection
could
alter
his
wishes
or
his
opinion
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
He
had
given
it
,
he
could
assure
her
,
very
long
and
calm
consideration
;
he
had
been
walking
away
from
William
Larkins
the
whole
morning
,
to
have
his
thoughts
to
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
there
is
one
difficulty
unprovided
for
,
"
cried
Emma
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
William
Larkins
will
not
like
it
.
<EOS>
You
must
get
his
consent
before
you
ask
mine
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
promised
,
however
,
to
think
of
it
;
and
pretty
nearly
promised
,
moreover
,
to
think
of
it
,
with
the
intention
of
finding
it
a
very
good
scheme
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
remarkable
,
that
Emma
,
in
the
many
,
very
many
,
points
of
view
in
which
she
was
now
beginning
to
consider
Donwell
Abbey
,
was
never
struck
with
any
sense
of
injury
to
her
nephew
Henry
,
whose
rights
as
heir
-
expectant
had
formerly
been
so
tenaciously
regarded
.
<EOS>
Think
she
must
of
the
possible
difference
to
the
poor
little
boy
;
and
yet
she
only
gave
herself
a
saucy
conscious
smile
about
it
,
and
found
amusement
in
detecting
the
real
cause
of
that
violent
dislike
of
Mr.
Knightley
's
marrying
Jane
Fairfax
,
or
any
body
else
,
which
at
the
time
she
had
wholly
imputed
to
the
amiable
solicitude
of
the
sister
and
the
aunt
.
  
<EOS>
This
proposal
of
his
,
this
plan
of
marrying
and
continuing
at
Hartfield
 
the
more
she
contemplated
it
,
the
more
pleasing
it
became
.
<EOS>
His
evils
seemed
to
lessen
,
her
own
advantages
to
increase
,
their
mutual
good
to
outweigh
every
drawback
.
<EOS>
Such
a
companion
for
herself
in
the
periods
of
anxiety
and
cheerlessness
before
her
!
 
<EOS>
Such
a
partner
in
all
those
duties
and
cares
to
which
time
must
be
giving
increase
of
melancholy
!
  
<EOS>
She
would
have
been
too
happy
but
for
poor
Harriet
;
but
every
blessing
of
her
own
seemed
to
involve
and
advance
the
sufferings
of
her
friend
,
who
must
now
be
even
excluded
from
Hartfield
.
<EOS>
The
delightful
family
party
which
Emma
was
securing
for
herself
,
poor
Harriet
must
,
in
mere
charitable
caution
,
be
kept
at
a
distance
from
.
<EOS>
She
would
be
a
loser
in
every
way
.
<EOS>
Emma
could
not
deplore
her
future
absence
as
any
deduction
from
her
own
enjoyment
.
<EOS>
In
such
a
party
,
Harriet
would
be
rather
a
dead
weight
than
otherwise
;
but
for
the
poor
girl
herself
,
it
seemed
a
peculiarly
cruel
necessity
that
was
to
be
placing
her
in
such
a
state
of
unmerited
punishment
.
  
<EOS>
In
time
,
of
course
,
Mr.
Knightley
would
be
forgotten
,
that
is
,
supplanted
;
but
this
could
not
be
expected
to
happen
very
early
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Knightley
himself
would
be
doing
nothing
to
assist
the
cure
;
 
not
like
Mr.
Elton
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Knightley
,
always
so
kind
,
so
feeling
,
<EOS>
so
truly
considerate
for
every
body
,
would
never
deserve
to
be
less
worshipped
than
now
;
and
it
really
was
too
much
to
hope
even
of
Harriet
,
that
she
could
be
in
love
with
more
than
_
three
_
men
in
one
year
.
    
<EOS>
It
was
a
very
great
relief
to
Emma
to
find
Harriet
as
desirous
as
herself
to
avoid
a
meeting
.
<EOS>
Their
intercourse
was
painful
enough
by
letter
.
<EOS>
How
much
worse
,
had
they
been
obliged
to
meet
!
  
<EOS>
Harriet
expressed
herself
very
much
as
might
be
supposed
,
without
reproaches
,
or
apparent
sense
of
ill
-
usage
;
and
yet
Emma
fancied
there
was
a
something
of
resentment
,
a
something
bordering
on
it
in
her
style
,
which
increased
the
desirableness
of
their
being
separate
.
 
<EOS>
It
might
be
only
her
own
consciousness
;
but
it
seemed
as
if
an
angel
only
could
have
been
quite
without
resentment
under
such
a
stroke
.
  
<EOS>
She
had
no
difficulty
in
procuring
Isabella
's
invitation
;
and
she
was
fortunate
in
having
a
sufficient
reason
for
asking
it
,
without
resorting
to
invention
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
tooth
amiss
.
<EOS>
Harriet
really
wished
,
and
had
wished
some
time
,
to
consult
a
dentist
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
John
Knightley
was
delighted
to
be
of
use
;
any
thing
of
ill
health
was
a
recommendation
to
her
 
and
though
not
so
fond
of
a
dentist
as
of
a
Mr.
Wingfield
,
she
was
quite
eager
to
have
Harriet
under
her
care
.
 
<EOS>
When
it
was
thus
settled
on
her
sister
's
side
,
Emma
proposed
it
to
her
friend
,
and
found
her
very
persuadable
.
 
<EOS>
Harriet
was
to
go
;
she
was
invited
for
at
least
a
fortnight
;
she
was
to
be
conveyed
in
Mr.
Woodhouse
's
carriage
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
all
arranged
,
it
was
all
completed
,
and
Harriet
was
safe
in
Brunswick
Square
.
  
<EOS>
Now
Emma
could
,
indeed
,
enjoy
Mr.
Knightley
's
visits
;
now
she
could
talk
,
and
she
could
listen
with
true
happiness
,
unchecked
by
that
sense
of
injustice
,
of
guilt
,
of
something
most
painful
,
which
had
haunted
her
when
remembering
<EOS>
how
disappointed
a
heart
was
near
her
,
<EOS>
how
much
might
at
that
moment
,
and
at
a
little
distance
,
be
enduring
by
the
feelings
which
she
had
led
astray
herself
.
  
<EOS>
The
difference
of
Harriet
at
Mrs.
Goddard
's
,
or
in
London
,
made
perhaps
an
unreasonable
difference
in
Emma
's
sensations
;
but
she
could
not
think
of
her
in
London
without
objects
of
curiosity
and
employment
,
which
must
be
averting
the
past
,
and
carrying
her
out
of
herself
.
  
<EOS>
She
would
not
allow
any
other
anxiety
to
succeed
directly
to
the
place
in
her
mind
which
Harriet
had
occupied
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
communication
before
her
,
one
<EOS>
which
_
<EOS>
she
_
only
could
be
competent
to
make
 
the
confession
of
her
engagement
to
her
father
;
but
she
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
at
present
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
resolved
to
defer
the
disclosure
till
Mrs.
Weston
were
safe
and
well
.
<EOS>
No
additional
agitation
should
be
thrown
at
this
period
among
those
she
loved
 
and
<EOS>
the
evil
should
not
act
on
herself
by
anticipation
before
the
appointed
time
.
 
<EOS>
A
fortnight
,
at
least
,
of
leisure
and
peace
of
mind
,
to
crown
every
warmer
,
but
more
agitating
,
delight
,
should
be
hers
.
  
<EOS>
She
soon
resolved
,
equally
as
a
duty
and
a
pleasure
,
to
employ
half
an
hour
of
this
holiday
of
spirits
in
calling
on
Miss
Fairfax
.
 
<EOS>
She
ought
to
go
 
<EOS>
and
she
was
longing
to
see
her
;
<EOS>
the
resemblance
of
their
present
situations
increasing
every
other
motive
of
goodwill
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
a
_
secret
_
satisfaction
;
but
the
consciousness
of
a
similarity
of
prospect
would
certainly
add
to
the
interest
with
which
she
should
attend
to
any
thing
Jane
might
communicate
.
  
<EOS>
She
went
 
<EOS>
she
had
driven
once
unsuccessfully
to
the
door
,
but
had
not
been
into
the
house
since
the
morning
after
Box
Hill
,
when
poor
Jane
had
been
in
such
distress
as
had
filled
her
with
compassion
,
though
all
the
worst
of
her
sufferings
had
been
unsuspected
.
 
<EOS>
The
fear
of
being
still
unwelcome
,
determined
her
,
though
assured
of
their
being
at
home
,
to
wait
in
the
passage
,
and
send
up
her
name
.
 
<EOS>
She
heard
Patty
announcing
it
;
but
no
such
bustle
succeeded
as
poor
Miss
Bates
had
before
made
so
happily
intelligible
.
 
<EOS>
No
<EOS>
;
she
heard
nothing
but
the
instant
reply
of
,
"
Beg
her
to
walk
up
;
"
 
and
a
moment
afterwards
she
was
met
on
the
stairs
by
Jane
herself
,
coming
eagerly
forward
,
as
if
no
other
reception
of
her
were
felt
sufficient
.
 
<EOS>
Emma
had
never
seen
her
look
<EOS>
so
well
<EOS>
,
so
lovely
,
so
engaging
.
<EOS>
There
was
consciousness
,
animation
,
and
warmth
;
there
was
every
thing
which
her
countenance
or
manner
could
ever
have
wanted
.
  
<EOS>
She
came
forward
with
an
offered
hand
;
and
said
,
in
a
low
,
but
very
feeling
tone
,
  
<EOS>
"
This
is
most
kind
,
indeed
!
 
<EOS>
Miss
Woodhouse
,
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
express
 
<EOS>
I
hope
you
will
believe
 
Excuse
me
for
being
so
entirely
without
words
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
was
gratified
,
and
would
soon
have
shewn
no
want
of
words
,
if
the
sound
of
Mrs.
Elton
's
voice
from
the
sitting
-
room
had
not
checked
her
,
and
made
it
expedient
to
compress
all
her
friendly
and
all
her
congratulatory
sensations
into
a
very
,
very
earnest
shake
of
the
hand
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bates
and
Mrs.
Elton
were
together
.
<EOS>
Miss
Bates
was
out
,
which
accounted
for
the
previous
tranquillity
.
<EOS>
Emma
could
have
wished
Mrs.
Elton
elsewhere
;
but
she
was
in
a
humour
to
have
patience
with
every
body
;
and
as
Mrs.
Elton
met
her
with
unusual
graciousness
,
she
hoped
the
rencontre
would
do
them
no
harm
.
  
<EOS>
She
soon
believed
herself
to
penetrate
Mrs.
Elton
's
thoughts
,
and
understand
why
she
was
,
like
herself
,
in
happy
spirits
;
it
was
being
in
Miss
Fairfax
's
confidence
,
and
fancying
herself
acquainted
with
what
was
still
a
secret
to
other
people
.
<EOS>
Emma
saw
symptoms
of
it
immediately
in
the
expression
of
her
face
;
and
while
paying
her
own
compliments
to
Mrs.
Bates
,
and
appearing
to
attend
to
the
good
old
lady
's
replies
,
she
saw
her
with
a
sort
of
anxious
parade
of
mystery
fold
up
a
letter
which
she
had
apparently
been
reading
aloud
to
Miss
Fairfax
,
and
return
it
into
the
purple
and
gold
reticule
by
her
side
,
saying
,
with
significant
nods
,
  
<EOS>
"
We
can
finish
this
some
other
time
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
You
and
I
shall
not
want
opportunities
.
<EOS>
And
,
in
fact
,
you
have
heard
all
the
essential
already
.
<EOS>
I
only
wanted
to
prove
to
you
that
Mrs.
S.
admits
our
apology
,
and
is
not
offended
.
<EOS>
You
see
how
delightfully
she
writes
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
she
is
a
sweet
creature
!
<EOS>
You
would
have
doated
on
her
,
had
you
gone
.
 
<EOS>
But
not
a
word
more
.
<EOS>
Let
us
be
discreet
 
quite
on
our
good
behaviour
.
 
<EOS>
Hush
!
 
<EOS>
You
remember
those
lines
 
<EOS>
I
forget
the
poem
at
this
moment
:
  
"
For
when
a
lady
's
in
the
case
,
"
You
know
all
other
things
give
place
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Now
I
say
,
my
dear
,
in
_
our
_
case
,
for
_
lady
_
,
read
 
mum
!
<EOS>
a
word
to
the
wise
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
in
a
fine
flow
of
spirits
,
<EOS>
an't
<EOS>
I
?
<EOS>
But
I
want
to
set
your
heart
at
ease
as
to
Mrs.
S.
 
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
My
_
representation
,
you
see
,
has
quite
appeased
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
And
again
,
on
Emma
's
merely
turning
her
head
to
look
at
Mrs.
Bates
's
knitting
,
she
added
,
in
a
half
whisper
,
  
<EOS>
"
I
mentioned
no
_
names
_
<EOS>
,
you
will
observe
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
no
;
cautious
as
a
minister
of
state
.
<EOS>
I
managed
it
extremely
well
.
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
could
not
doubt
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
palpable
display
,
repeated
on
every
possible
occasion
.
<EOS>
When
they
had
all
talked
a
little
while
in
harmony
of
the
weather
and
Mrs.
Weston
,
she
found
herself
abruptly
addressed
with
,
  
<EOS>
"
Do
not
you
think
,
Miss
Woodhouse
,
our
saucy
little
friend
here
is
charmingly
recovered
?
 
<EOS>
Do
not
you
think
her
cure
does
Perry
the
highest
credit
?
 
<EOS>
(
here
was
a
side
-
glance
of
great
meaning
at
Jane
.
)
<EOS>
Upon
my
word
,
Perry
has
restored
her
in
a
wonderful
short
time
!
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
if
you
had
seen
her
,
as
I
did
,
when
she
was
at
the
worst
!
"
 
<EOS>
And
when
Mrs.
Bates
was
saying
something
to
Emma
,
whispered
farther
,
<EOS>
"
We
do
not
say
a
word
of
any
_
assistance
<EOS>
_
that
Perry
might
have
<EOS>
;
not
a
word
of
a
certain
young
physician
from
Windsor
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
no
;
Perry
shall
have
all
the
credit
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
scarce
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
,
Miss
Woodhouse
,
"
she
shortly
afterwards
began
,
"
since
the
party
to
Box
Hill
.
<EOS>
Very
pleasant
party
.
<EOS>
But
yet
I
think
there
was
something
wanting
.
<EOS>
Things
did
not
seem
 
<EOS>
that
is
,
there
seemed
a
little
cloud
upon
the
spirits
of
some
.
 
<EOS>
So
it
appeared
to
me
at
least
,
but
I
might
be
mistaken
.
<EOS>
However
,
I
think
it
answered
so
far
as
to
tempt
one
to
go
again
.
<EOS>
What
say
you
both
to
our
collecting
the
same
party
,
and
exploring
to
Box
Hill
again
,
while
the
fine
weather
lasts
?
 
<EOS>
It
must
be
the
same
party
,
you
know
,
quite
the
same
party
,
not
_
one
_
exception
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Soon
after
this
Miss
Bates
came
in
,
and
Emma
could
not
help
being
diverted
by
the
perplexity
of
her
first
answer
to
herself
,
resulting
<EOS>
,
she
supposed
,
from
doubt
of
what
might
be
said
,
and
impatience
to
say
every
thing
.
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
dear
Miss
Woodhouse
,
you
are
all
kindness
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
impossible
to
say
 
Yes
,
indeed
,
I
quite
understand
 
dearest
Jane
's
prospects
 
<EOS>
that
is
,
I
do
not
mean
.
 
<EOS>
But
she
is
charmingly
recovered
.
 
<EOS>
How
is
Mr.
Woodhouse
?
 
<EOS>
I
am
so
glad
.
 
<EOS>
Quite
out
of
my
power
.
 
<EOS>
Such
a
happy
little
circle
as
you
find
us
here
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
Charming
young
man
!
 
<EOS>
that
is
 
so
very
friendly
;
I
mean
good
Mr.
Perry
!
 
<EOS>
such
attention
to
Jane
!
"
 
<EOS>
And
from
her
great
,
her
more
than
commonly
thankful
delight
towards
Mrs.
Elton
for
being
there
,
Emma
guessed
that
there
had
been
a
little
show
of
resentment
towards
Jane
,
from
the
vicarage
quarter
,
which
was
now
graciously
overcome
.
 
<EOS>
After
a
few
whispers
,
indeed
,
which
placed
it
beyond
a
guess
,
Mrs.
Elton
,
speaking
louder
,
said
,
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
here
I
am
,
my
good
friend
;
and
here
I
have
been
so
long
,
that
anywhere
else
I
should
think
it
necessary
to
apologise
;
but
,
the
truth
is
,
that
I
am
waiting
for
my
lord
and
master
.
<EOS>
He
promised
to
join
me
here
,
and
pay
his
respects
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
!
<EOS>
are
we
to
have
the
pleasure
of
a
call
from
Mr.
Elton
?
 
<EOS>
That
will
be
a
favour
indeed
!
<EOS>
for
I
know
gentlemen
do
not
like
morning
visits
,
and
Mr.
Elton
's
time
is
so
engaged
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
word
it
is
,
Miss
Bates
.
 
<EOS>
He
really
is
engaged
from
morning
to
night
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
no
end
of
people
's
coming
to
him
,
on
some
pretence
or
other
.
 
<EOS>
The
magistrates
,
and
overseers
,
and
churchwardens
,
are
always
wanting
his
opinion
.
<EOS>
They
seem
not
able
to
do
any
thing
without
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
word
,
Mr.
E.
,
"
I
often
say
,
"
rather
you
than
I.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
what
would
become
of
my
crayons
and
my
instrument
,
if
I
had
half
so
many
applicants
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Bad
enough
as
it
is
,
for
I
absolutely
neglect
them
both
to
an
unpardonable
degree
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
I
have
not
played
a
bar
this
fortnight
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
he
is
coming
,
I
assure
you
:
yes
,
indeed
,
on
purpose
to
wait
on
you
all
.
"
<EOS>
And
putting
up
her
hand
to
screen
her
words
from
Emma
 
"
A
congratulatory
visit
,
you
know
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
yes
,
quite
indispensable
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Bates
looked
about
her
,
so
happily
 
!
  
<EOS>
"
He
promised
to
come
to
me
as
soon
as
he
could
disengage
himself
from
Knightley
;
but
he
and
Knightley
are
shut
up
together
in
deep
consultation
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
E.
is
Knightley
's
right
hand
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
would
not
have
smiled
for
the
world
,
and
only
said
,
"
Is
Mr.
Elton
gone
on
foot
to
Donwell
?
 
<EOS>
He
will
have
a
hot
walk
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Oh
!
no
,
it
is
a
meeting
at
the
Crown
,
a
regular
meeting
.
<EOS>
Weston
and
Cole
will
be
there
too
;
but
one
is
apt
to
speak
only
of
those
who
lead
.
 
<EOS>
I
fancy
Mr.
E.
and
Knightley
<EOS>
have
every
thing
their
own
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Have
not
you
mistaken
the
day
?
"
said
Emma
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
almost
certain
that
the
meeting
at
the
Crown
is
not
till
to
-
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Knightley
was
at
Hartfield
yesterday
,
and
spoke
of
it
as
for
Saturday
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Oh
!
no
,
the
meeting
is
certainly
to
-
day
,
"
was
the
abrupt
answer
,
which
denoted
the
impossibility
of
any
blunder
on
Mrs.
Elton
's
side
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
believe
,
"
she
continued
,
"
this
is
the
most
troublesome
parish
that
ever
was
.
<EOS>
We
never
heard
of
such
things
at
Maple
Grove
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Your
parish
there
was
small
,
"
said
Jane
.
  
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
word
,
my
dear
,
I
do
not
know
,
for
I
never
heard
the
subject
talked
of
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
it
is
proved
by
the
smallness
of
the
school
,
which
I
have
heard
you
speak
of
,
as
under
the
patronage
of
your
sister
and
Mrs.
Bragge
;
the
only
school
,
and
not
more
than
five
-
and
-
twenty
children
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
you
clever
creature
,
that
's
very
true
.
<EOS>
What
a
thinking
brain
you
have
!
<EOS>
I
say
,
Jane
,
what
a
perfect
character
<EOS>
you
and
I
should
make
,
if
we
could
be
shaken
together
.
<EOS>
My
liveliness
and
your
solidity
would
produce
perfection
.
 
<EOS>
Not
that
I
presume
to
insinuate
,
however
,
<EOS>
that
_
some
_
people
may
not
think
_
you
_
perfection
already
.
 
<EOS>
But
hush
!
 
<EOS>
not
a
word
,
if
you
please
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
seemed
an
unnecessary
caution
;
Jane
was
wanting
to
give
her
words
,
not
to
Mrs.
Elton
,
but
to
Miss
Woodhouse
,
as
the
latter
plainly
saw
.
<EOS>
The
wish
of
distinguishing
her
,
as
far
as
civility
permitted
,
was
very
evident
,
though
it
could
not
often
proceed
beyond
a
look
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Elton
made
his
appearance
.
<EOS>
His
lady
greeted
him
with
some
of
her
sparkling
vivacity
.
  
<EOS>
"
Very
pretty
,
sir
,
upon
my
word
;
to
send
me
on
here
,
to
be
an
encumbrance
to
my
friends
,
so
long
before
you
vouchsafe
to
come
!
 
<EOS>
But
you
knew
what
a
dutiful
creature
you
had
to
deal
with
.
<EOS>
You
knew
I
should
not
stir
till
my
lord
and
master
appeared
.
 
<EOS>
Here
have
I
been
sitting
this
hour
,
giving
these
young
ladies
a
sample
of
true
conjugal
obedience
 
for
who
can
say
,
you
know
,
how
soon
it
may
be
wanted
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Elton
was
so
hot
and
tired
,
that
all
this
wit
seemed
thrown
away
.
<EOS>
His
civilities
to
the
other
ladies
must
be
paid
;
but
his
subsequent
object
was
to
lament
over
himself
for
the
heat
he
was
suffering
,
and
the
walk
he
had
had
for
nothing
.
  
<EOS>
"
When
I
got
to
Donwell
,
"
said
he
,
"
Knightley
could
not
be
found
.
<EOS>
Very
odd
!
<EOS>
very
unaccountable
!
<EOS>
after
the
note
I
sent
him
this
morning
,
and
the
message
he
returned
,
that
he
should
certainly
be
at
home
till
one
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Donwell
!
"
cried
his
wife
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Mr.
E.
,
you
have
not
been
to
Donwell
!
 
<EOS>
You
mean
the
Crown
;
you
come
from
the
meeting
at
the
Crown
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
that
's
to
-
morrow
;
and
I
particularly
wanted
to
see
Knightley
to
-
day
on
that
very
account
.
 
<EOS>
Such
a
dreadful
broiling
morning
!
 
<EOS>
I
went
over
the
fields
too
 
(
speaking
in
a
tone
of
great
ill
-
usage
,
)
which
made
it
so
much
the
worse
.
<EOS>
And
then
not
to
find
him
at
home
!
<EOS>
I
assure
you
I
am
not
at
all
pleased
.
<EOS>
And
no
apology
left
,
no
message
for
me
.
<EOS>
The
housekeeper
declared
she
knew
nothing
of
my
being
expected
.
 
<EOS>
Very
extraordinary
!
 
<EOS>
And
nobody
knew
at
all
which
way
he
was
gone
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
to
Hartfield
,
perhaps
to
the
Abbey
Mill
,
perhaps
into
his
woods
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Woodhouse
,
this
is
not
like
our
friend
Knightley
!
 
<EOS>
Can
you
explain
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
amused
herself
by
protesting
that
it
was
very
extraordinary
,
indeed
,
and
that
she
had
not
a
syllable
to
say
for
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
imagine
,
"
said
Mrs.
Elton
,
(
feeling
the
indignity
as
a
wife
ought
to
do
,
)
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
imagine
how
he
could
do
such
a
thing
by
you
,
of
all
people
in
the
world
!
<EOS>
The
very
last
person
whom
one
should
expect
to
be
forgotten
!
 
<EOS>
My
dear
Mr.
E.
,
he
must
have
left
a
message
for
you
<EOS>
,
I
am
sure
he
must
.
 
<EOS>
Not
even
Knightley
could
be
so
very
eccentric
;
 
and
his
servants
forgot
it
.
<EOS>
Depend
upon
it
,
that
was
the
case
:
and
very
likely
to
happen
with
the
Donwell
servants
,
who
are
all
,
I
have
often
observed
,
extremely
awkward
and
remiss
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
sure
I
would
not
have
such
a
creature
as
his
Harry
stand
at
our
sideboard
for
any
consideration
.
<EOS>
And
as
for
Mrs.
Hodges
,
Wright
holds
her
very
cheap
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
She
promised
Wright
a
receipt
,
and
never
sent
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
met
William
Larkins
,
"
continued
Mr.
Elton
,
"
as
I
got
near
the
house
,
and
he
told
me
I
should
not
find
his
master
at
home
,
but
I
did
not
believe
him
.
 
<EOS>
William
seemed
rather
out
of
humour
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
know
what
was
come
to
his
master
lately
,
he
said
,
but
he
could
hardly
ever
get
the
speech
of
him
.
<EOS>
I
have
nothing
to
do
with
William
's
wants
,
but
it
really
is
of
very
great
importance
that
_
I
_
should
see
Knightley
to
-
day
;
and
it
becomes
a
matter
,
therefore
,
of
very
serious
inconvenience
that
I
should
have
had
this
hot
walk
to
no
purpose
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
felt
that
she
could
not
do
better
than
go
home
directly
.
<EOS>
In
all
probability
she
was
at
this
very
time
waited
for
there
;
and
Mr.
Knightley
might
be
preserved
from
sinking
deeper
in
aggression
towards
Mr.
Elton
,
if
not
towards
William
Larkins
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
pleased
,
on
taking
leave
,
to
find
Miss
Fairfax
determined
to
attend
her
out
of
the
room
,
to
go
with
her
even
downstairs
;
it
gave
her
an
opportunity
which
she
immediately
made
use
of
,
to
say
,
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
as
well
,
perhaps
,
that
I
have
not
had
the
possibility
.
<EOS>
Had
you
not
been
surrounded
by
other
friends
,
I
might
have
been
tempted
to
introduce
a
subject
,
to
ask
questions
,
to
speak
more
openly
than
might
have
been
strictly
correct
.
 
<EOS>
I
feel
that
I
should
certainly
have
been
impertinent
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
"
cried
Jane
,
with
a
blush
and
an
hesitation
which
Emma
thought
infinitely
more
becoming
to
her
than
all
the
elegance
of
all
her
usual
composure
 
<EOS>
"
there
would
have
been
no
danger
.
<EOS>
The
danger
would
have
been
of
my
wearying
you
.
<EOS>
You
could
not
have
gratified
me
more
than
by
expressing
an
interest
 
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
Miss
Woodhouse
,
(
speaking
more
collectedly
,
)
with
the
consciousness
which
I
have
of
misconduct
,
very
great
misconduct
,
it
is
particularly
consoling
to
me
to
know
that
those
of
my
friends
,
whose
good
opinion
is
most
worth
preserving
,
are
not
disgusted
to
such
a
degree
as
to
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
time
for
half
that
I
could
wish
to
say
.
<EOS>
I
long
to
make
apologies
,
excuses
,
to
urge
something
for
myself
.
<EOS>
I
feel
it
so
very
due
.
<EOS>
But
,
unfortunately
 
in
short
,
if
your
compassion
does
not
stand
my
friend
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
Oh
!
you
are
too
scrupulous
,
indeed
you
are
,
"
cried
Emma
warmly
,
and
taking
her
hand
.
<EOS>
"
You
owe
me
no
apologies
;
and
every
body
to
whom
you
might
be
supposed
to
owe
them
,
is
so
perfectly
satisfied
,
so
delighted
even
 
"
  
"
You
are
very
kind
,
but
I
know
what
my
manners
were
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
So
cold
and
artificial
!
 
<EOS>
I
had
always
a
part
to
act
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
life
of
deceit
!
 
<EOS>
I
know
that
I
must
have
disgusted
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Pray
say
no
more
.
<EOS>
I
feel
that
all
the
apologies
should
be
on
my
side
.
<EOS>
Let
us
forgive
each
other
at
once
.
<EOS>
We
must
do
whatever
is
to
be
done
quickest
,
and
I
think
our
feelings
will
lose
no
time
there
.
<EOS>
I
hope
you
have
pleasant
accounts
from
Windsor
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Very
.
"
  
"
And
the
next
news
,
I
suppose
,
will
be
,
that
we
are
to
lose
you
 
just
as
I
begin
to
know
you
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
as
to
all
that
,
of
course
nothing
can
be
thought
of
yet
.
<EOS>
I
am
here
till
claimed
by
Colonel
and
Mrs.
Campbell
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nothing
can
be
actually
settled
yet
,
perhaps
,
"
replied
Emma
,
smiling
 
"
but
,
excuse
me
,
it
must
be
thought
of
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
smile
was
returned
as
Jane
answered
,
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
very
right
;
it
has
been
thought
of
.
<EOS>
And
I
will
own
to
you
,
<EOS>
(
I
am
sure
it
will
be
safe
)
,
that
so
far
as
our
living
with
Mr.
Churchill
at
Enscombe
,
it
is
settled
.
<EOS>
There
must
be
three
months
,
at
least
,
of
deep
mourning
;
but
when
they
are
over
,
I
imagine
there
will
be
nothing
more
to
wait
for
.

Thank
you
,
thank
you
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
just
what
I
wanted
to
be
assured
of
.

Oh
!

Mrs.
Weston
's
friends
were
all
made
happy
by
her
safety
;
and
if
the
satisfaction
of
her
well
-
doing
could
be
increased
to
Emma
,
it
was
by
knowing
her
to
be
the
mother
of
a
little
girl
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
decided
in
wishing
for
a
Miss
Weston
.
<EOS>
She
would
not
acknowledge
that
it
was
with
any
view
of
making
a
match
for
her
,
hereafter
,
with
either
of
Isabella
's
sons
;
but
she
was
convinced
that
a
daughter
would
suit
both
father
and
mother
best
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
a
great
comfort
to
Mr.
Weston
,
as
he
grew
older
 
and
even
Mr.
Weston
might
be
growing
older
ten
years
hence
 
to
have
his
fireside
enlivened
by
the
sports
and
the
nonsense
,
the
freaks
and
the
fancies
of
a
child
never
banished
from
home
;
and
Mrs.
Weston
 
no
one
could
doubt
that
a
daughter
would
be
most
to
her
;
and
it
would
be
quite
a
pity
that
any
one
who
so
well
knew
how
to
teach
,
should
not
have
their
powers
in
exercise
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
has
had
the
advantage
,
you
know
,
of
practising
on
me
,
"
she
continued
 
"
like
La
Baronne
d'Almane
on
La
Comtesse
d'Ostalis
,
in
Madame
de
Genlis
'
Adelaide
and
Theodore
,
and
we
shall
now
see
her
own
little
Adelaide
educated
on
a
more
perfect
plan
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
,
"
replied
Mr.
Knightley
,
"
she
will
indulge
her
even
more
than
she
did
you
,
and
believe
that
she
does
not
indulge
her
at
all
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
the
only
difference
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Poor
child
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Emma
;
"
at
that
rate
,
what
will
become
of
her
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nothing
very
bad
.
 
<EOS>
The
fate
of
thousands
.
<EOS>
She
will
be
disagreeable
in
infancy
,
and
correct
herself
as
she
grows
older
.
<EOS>
I
am
losing
all
my
bitterness
against
spoilt
children
,
my
dearest
Emma
.
<EOS>
I
,
who
am
owing
all
my
happiness
to
_
you
_
,
would
not
it
be
horrible
ingratitude
in
me
to
be
severe
on
them
?
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
laughed
,
and
replied
:
"
<EOS>
But
I
had
the
assistance
of
all
your
endeavours
to
counteract
the
indulgence
of
other
people
.
<EOS>
I
doubt
whether
my
own
sense
would
have
corrected
me
without
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
?
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
doubt
.
<EOS>
Nature
gave
you
understanding
:
 
<EOS>
Miss
Taylor
gave
you
principles
.
<EOS>
You
must
have
done
well
.
<EOS>
My
interference
was
quite
as
likely
to
do
harm
as
good
.
<EOS>
It
was
very
natural
for
you
to
say
,
what
right
has
he
to
lecture
me
?
 
<EOS>
and
I
am
afraid
very
natural
for
you
to
feel
that
it
was
done
in
a
disagreeable
manner
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
believe
I
did
you
any
good
.
<EOS>
The
good
was
all
to
myself
,
by
making
you
an
object
of
the
tenderest
affection
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
think
about
you
so
much
without
doating
on
you
,
faults
and
all
;
and
by
dint
of
fancying
so
many
errors
,
have
been
in
love
with
you
ever
since
you
were
thirteen
at
least
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
you
were
of
use
to
me
,
"
cried
Emma
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
very
often
influenced
rightly
by
you
 
oftener
than
I
would
own
at
the
time
.
<EOS>
I
am
very
sure
you
did
me
good
.
<EOS>
And
if
poor
little
Anna
Weston
is
to
be
spoiled
,
it
will
be
the
greatest
humanity
in
you
to
do
as
much
for
her
as
you
have
done
for
me
,
except
falling
in
love
with
her
when
she
is
thirteen
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
often
,
when
you
were
a
girl
,
have
you
said
to
me
,
with
one
of
your
saucy
looks
 
"
Mr.
Knightley
,
I
am
going
to
do
so
-
and
-
so
<EOS>
;
papa
says
I
may
,
or
I
have
Miss
Taylor
's
leave
"
 
something
which
,
you
knew
,
<EOS>
I
did
not
approve
.
<EOS>
In
such
cases
my
interference
was
giving
you
two
bad
feelings
instead
of
one
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
an
amiable
creature
I
was
!
 
<EOS>
No
wonder
you
should
hold
my
speeches
in
such
affectionate
remembrance
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
"
Mr
.
Knightley
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
You
always
called
me
,
"
Mr.
Knightley
;
"
and
,
from
habit
,
it
has
not
so
very
formal
a
sound
.
 
<EOS>
And
yet
it
is
formal
.
<EOS>
I
want
you
to
call
me
something
else
,
but
I
do
not
know
what
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
remember
once
calling
you
"
George
,
"
in
one
of
my
amiable
fits
,
about
ten
years
ago
.
<EOS>
I
did
it
because
I
thought
it
would
offend
you
;
but
,
as
you
made
no
objection
,
I
never
did
it
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
can
not
you
call
me
"
George
"
now
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Impossible
!
 
<EOS>
I
never
can
call
you
any
thing
but
"
Mr.
Knightley
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
promise
even
to
equal
the
elegant
terseness
of
Mrs.
Elton
,
by
calling
you
Mr.
K.
 
<EOS>
But
I
will
promise
,
"
she
added
presently
,
laughing
and
blushing
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
promise
to
call
you
once
by
your
Christian
name
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
say
when
,
but
perhaps
you
may
guess
where
;
 
in
the
building
in
which
N.
takes
M.
for
better
,
for
worse
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
grieved
that
she
could
not
be
more
openly
just
to
one
important
service
which
his
better
sense
would
have
rendered
her
,
to
the
advice
which
would
have
saved
her
from
the
worst
of
all
her
womanly
follies
 
<EOS>
her
wilful
intimacy
with
Harriet
Smith
;
but
<EOS>
it
was
too
tender
a
subject
.
 
<EOS>
She
could
not
enter
on
it
.
 
<EOS>
Harriet
was
very
seldom
mentioned
between
them
.
<EOS>
This
,
on
his
side
,
might
merely
proceed
from
her
not
being
thought
of
;
but
Emma
was
rather
inclined
to
attribute
it
to
delicacy
,
and
a
suspicion
,
from
some
appearances
,
that
their
friendship
were
declining
.
<EOS>
She
was
aware
herself
,
that
,
parting
under
any
other
circumstances
,
they
certainly
should
have
corresponded
more
,
and
that
her
intelligence
would
not
have
rested
,
as
it
now
almost
wholly
did
,
on
Isabella
's
letters
.
<EOS>
He
might
observe
that
it
was
so
.
<EOS>
The
pain
of
being
obliged
to
practise
concealment
towards
him
,
was
very
little
inferior
to
the
pain
of
having
made
Harriet
unhappy
.
  
<EOS>
Isabella
sent
quite
as
good
an
account
of
her
visitor
as
could
be
expected
;
on
her
first
arrival
she
had
thought
her
out
of
spirits
,
which
appeared
perfectly
natural
,
as
there
was
a
dentist
to
be
consulted
;
but
,
since
that
business
had
been
over
,
she
did
not
appear
to
find
Harriet
different
from
what
she
had
known
her
before
.
 
<EOS>
Isabella
,
to
be
sure
,
was
no
very
quick
observer
;
yet
if
Harriet
had
not
been
equal
to
playing
with
the
children
,
it
would
not
have
escaped
her
.
<EOS>
Emma
's
comforts
and
hopes
were
most
agreeably
carried
on
,
by
Harriet
's
being
to
stay
longer
;
her
fortnight
was
likely
to
be
a
month
at
least
.
<EOS>
Mr.
and
Mrs.
John
Knightley
were
to
come
down
in
August
,
and
she
was
invited
to
remain
till
they
could
bring
her
back
.
  
<EOS>
"
John
does
not
even
mention
your
friend
,
"
said
Mr.
Knightley
.
<EOS>
"
Here
is
his
answer
,
if
you
like
to
see
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
the
answer
to
the
communication
of
his
intended
marriage
.
<EOS>
Emma
accepted
it
with
a
very
eager
hand
,
with
an
impatience
all
alive
to
know
what
he
would
say
about
it
,
and
not
at
all
checked
by
hearing
that
her
friend
was
unmentioned
.
  
<EOS>
"
John
enters
like
a
brother
into
my
happiness
,
"
continued
Mr.
Knightley
,
"
but
he
is
no
complimenter
;
and
though
I
well
know
him
to
have
,
likewise
,
a
most
brotherly
affection
for
you
,
he
is
so
far
from
making
flourishes
,
that
any
other
young
woman
might
think
him
rather
cool
in
her
praise
.
<EOS>
But
I
am
not
afraid
of
your
seeing
what
he
writes
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
writes
like
a
sensible
man
,
"
replied
Emma
,
when
she
had
read
the
letter
.
<EOS>
"
I
honour
his
sincerity
.
<EOS>
It
is
very
plain
that
he
considers
the
good
fortune
of
the
engagement
as
all
on
my
side
,
but
that
he
is
not
without
hope
of
my
growing
,
in
time
,
as
worthy
of
your
affection
,
as
you
think
me
already
.
<EOS>
Had
he
said
any
thing
to
bear
a
different
construction
,
I
should
not
have
believed
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
Emma
,
he
means
no
such
thing
.
<EOS>
He
only
means
 
"
  
"
He
and
I
should
differ
very
little
in
our
estimation
of
the
two
,
"
interrupted
she
,
with
a
sort
of
serious
smile
 
"
much
less
,
perhaps
,
than
he
is
aware
of
,
if
we
could
enter
without
ceremony
or
reserve
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Emma
,
my
dear
Emma
 
"
  
"
Oh
!
"
she
cried
with
more
thorough
gaiety
,
"
if
you
fancy
your
brother
<EOS>
does
not
do
me
justice
,
only
wait
till
my
dear
father
is
in
the
secret
,
and
hear
his
opinion
.
<EOS>
Depend
upon
it
,
he
will
be
much
farther
from
doing
_
you
_
justice
.
<EOS>
He
will
think
all
the
happiness
,
all
the
advantage
,
on
your
side
of
the
question
;
all
the
merit
on
mine
.
<EOS>
I
wish
I
may
not
sink
into
"
poor
Emma
"
with
him
at
once
.
 
<EOS>
His
tender
compassion
towards
oppressed
worth
can
go
no
farther
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
,
"
I
wish
your
father
might
be
half
as
easily
convinced
as
John
will
be
,
of
our
having
every
right
that
equal
worth
can
give
,
to
be
happy
together
.
<EOS>
I
am
amused
by
one
part
of
John
's
letter
 
<EOS>
did
you
notice
it
?
 
<EOS>
where
he
says
,
that
my
information
did
not
take
him
wholly
by
surprize
,
that
he
was
rather
in
expectation
of
hearing
something
of
the
kind
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
understand
your
brother
,
he
only
means
so
far
as
your
having
some
thoughts
of
marrying
.
<EOS>
He
had
no
idea
of
me
.
<EOS>
He
seems
perfectly
unprepared
for
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
yes
 
<EOS>
but
I
am
amused
that
he
should
have
seen
so
far
into
my
feelings
.
<EOS>
What
has
he
been
judging
by
?
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
conscious
of
any
difference
in
my
spirits
or
conversation
that
could
prepare
him
at
this
time
for
my
marrying
any
more
than
at
another
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
was
so
,
I
suppose
.
<EOS>
I
dare
say
there
was
a
difference
when
I
was
staying
with
them
the
other
day
.
<EOS>
I
believe
I
did
not
play
with
the
children
quite
so
much
as
usual
.
<EOS>
I
remember
one
evening
the
poor
boys
saying
,
"
Uncle
seems
always
tired
now
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
The
time
was
coming
when
the
news
must
spread
farther
,
and
other
persons
'
reception
of
it
tried
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
Mrs.
Weston
was
sufficiently
recovered
to
admit
Mr.
Woodhouse
's
visits
,
Emma
having
it
in
view
that
her
gentle
reasonings
should
be
employed
in
the
cause
,
resolved
first
to
announce
it
at
home
,
and
then
at
Randalls
.
 
<EOS>
But
how
to
break
it
to
her
father
at
last
!
 
<EOS>
She
had
bound
herself
to
do
it
,
in
such
an
hour
of
Mr.
Knightley
's
absence
,
or
when
it
came
to
the
point
her
heart
would
have
failed
her
,
and
she
must
have
put
it
off
;
but
Mr.
Knightley
was
to
come
at
such
a
time
,
and
follow
up
the
beginning
she
was
to
make
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
forced
to
speak
,
and
to
speak
cheerfully
too
.
<EOS>
She
must
not
make
it
a
more
decided
subject
of
misery
to
him
,
by
a
melancholy
tone
herself
.
<EOS>
She
must
not
appear
to
think
it
a
misfortune
.
 
<EOS>
With
all
the
spirits
she
could
command
,
she
prepared
him
first
for
something
strange
,
and
then
,
in
a
few
words
,
said
,
that
if
his
consent
and
approbation
could
be
obtained
 
which
,
she
trusted
,
would
be
attended
with
no
difficulty
,
since
it
was
a
plan
to
promote
the
happiness
of
all
 
she
and
Mr.
Knightley
meant
to
marry
;
by
which
means
Hartfield
would
receive
the
constant
addition
of
that
person
's
company
whom
she
knew
he
loved
,
next
to
his
daughters
and
Mrs.
Weston
,
best
in
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
Poor
man
!
 
<EOS>
it
was
at
first
a
considerable
shock
to
him
,
and
he
tried
earnestly
to
dissuade
her
from
it
.
<EOS>
She
was
reminded
,
more
than
once
,
of
having
always
said
she
would
never
marry
,
and
assured
that
it
would
be
a
great
deal
better
for
her
to
remain
single
;
and
told
of
poor
Isabella
,
and
poor
Miss
Taylor
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
would
not
do
.
<EOS>
Emma
hung
about
him
affectionately
,
and
smiled
,
and
said
it
must
be
so
;
and
that
he
must
not
class
her
with
Isabella
and
Mrs.
Weston
,
whose
marriages
taking
them
from
Hartfield
,
had
,
indeed
,
made
a
melancholy
change
:
but
she
was
not
going
from
Hartfield
;
she
should
be
always
there
;
she
was
introducing
no
change
in
their
numbers
or
their
comforts
but
for
the
better
;
and
she
was
very
sure
that
he
would
be
a
great
deal
the
happier
for
having
Mr.
Knightley
always
at
hand
,
when
he
were
once
got
used
to
the
idea
.
 
<EOS>
Did
he
not
love
Mr.
Knightley
very
much
?
 
<EOS>
He
would
not
deny
that
he
did
,
she
was
sure
.
 
<EOS>
Whom
did
he
ever
want
to
consult
on
business
but
Mr.
Knightley
?
 
<EOS>
Who
was
so
useful
to
him
,
who
so
ready
to
write
his
letters
,
who
so
glad
to
assist
him
?
 
<EOS>
Who
so
cheerful
,
so
attentive
,
so
attached
to
him
?
 
<EOS>
Would
not
he
like
to
have
him
always
on
the
spot
?
 
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
That
was
all
very
true
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Knightley
could
not
be
there
too
often
;
he
should
be
glad
to
see
him
every
day
;
 
but
they
did
see
him
every
day
as
it
was
.
 
<EOS>
Why
could
not
they
go
on
as
they
had
done
?
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Woodhouse
could
not
be
soon
reconciled
;
but
the
worst
was
overcome
,
the
idea
was
given
;
time
and
continual
repetition
must
do
the
rest
.
 
<EOS>
To
Emma
's
entreaties
and
assurances
succeeded
Mr.
Knightley
's
,
whose
fond
praise
of
her
gave
the
subject
even
a
kind
of
welcome
;
and
he
was
soon
used
to
be
talked
to
by
each
,
on
every
fair
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
They
had
all
the
assistance
which
Isabella
could
give
,
by
letters
of
the
strongest
approbation
;
and
Mrs.
Weston
was
ready
,
on
the
first
meeting
,
to
consider
the
subject
in
the
most
serviceable
light
 
first
,
as
a
settled
,
and
,
secondly
,
as
a
good
one
 
<EOS>
well
aware
of
the
nearly
equal
importance
of
the
two
recommendations
to
Mr.
Woodhouse
's
mind
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
agreed
upon
,
as
what
was
to
be
;
and
every
body
by
whom
he
was
used
to
be
guided
assuring
him
that
it
would
be
for
his
happiness
;
and
having
some
feelings
himself
which
almost
admitted
it
,
he
began
to
think
that
some
time
or
other
 
in
another
year
or
two
,
perhaps
 
it
might
not
be
so
very
bad
if
the
marriage
did
take
place
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Weston
was
acting
no
part
,
feigning
no
feelings
in
all
that
she
said
to
him
in
favour
of
the
event
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
been
extremely
surprized
,
never
more
so
,
than
when
Emma
first
opened
the
affair
to
her
;
but
she
saw
in
it
only
increase
of
happiness
to
all
,
and
had
no
scruple
in
urging
him
to
the
utmost
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
such
a
regard
for
Mr.
Knightley
,
as
to
think
he
deserved
even
her
dearest
Emma
;
and
it
was
in
every
respect
so
proper
,
suitable
,
and
unexceptionable
a
connexion
,
and
in
one
respect
,
one
point
of
the
highest
importance
,
so
peculiarly
eligible
,
so
singularly
fortunate
,
that
now
it
seemed
as
if
Emma
could
not
safely
have
attached
herself
to
any
other
creature
,
and
that
she
had
herself
been
the
stupidest
of
beings
in
not
having
thought
of
it
,
and
wished
it
long
ago
.
 
<EOS>
How
very
few
of
those
men
in
a
rank
of
life
to
address
Emma
would
have
renounced
their
own
home
for
Hartfield
!
<EOS>
And
who
but
Mr.
Knightley
could
know
and
bear
with
Mr.
Woodhouse
,
so
as
to
make
such
an
arrangement
desirable
!
 
<EOS>
The
difficulty
of
disposing
of
poor
Mr.
Woodhouse
had
been
always
felt
in
her
husband
's
plans
and
her
own
,
for
a
marriage
between
Frank
and
Emma
.
<EOS>
How
to
settle
the
claims
of
Enscombe
and
Hartfield
had
been
a
continual
impediment
 
less
acknowledged
by
Mr.
Weston
than
by
herself
 
<EOS>
but
even
he
had
never
been
able
to
finish
the
subject
better
than
by
saying
 
"
Those
matters
will
take
care
of
themselves
;
the
young
people
will
find
a
way
.
<EOS>
"
But
here
there
was
nothing
to
be
shifted
off
in
a
wild
speculation
on
the
future
.
<EOS>
It
was
all
right
,
all
open
,
all
equal
.
<EOS>
No
sacrifice
on
any
side
worth
the
name
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
union
of
the
highest
promise
of
felicity
in
itself
,
and
without
one
real
,
rational
difficulty
to
oppose
or
delay
it
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Weston
,
with
her
baby
on
her
knee
,
indulging
in
such
reflections
as
these
,
was
one
of
the
happiest
women
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
If
any
thing
could
increase
her
delight
,
it
was
perceiving
that
the
baby
would
soon
have
outgrown
its
first
set
of
caps
.
  
<EOS>
The
news
was
universally
a
surprize
wherever
it
spread
;
and
Mr.
Weston
had
his
five
minutes
share
of
it
;
but
five
minutes
were
enough
to
familiarise
the
idea
to
his
quickness
of
mind
.
 
<EOS>
He
saw
the
advantages
of
the
match
,
and
rejoiced
in
them
with
all
the
constancy
of
his
wife
;
but
the
wonder
of
it
was
very
soon
nothing
;
and
by
the
end
of
an
hour
he
was
not
far
from
believing
that
he
had
always
foreseen
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
to
be
a
secret
,
I
conclude
,
"
said
he
.
<EOS>
"
These
matters
are
always
a
secret
,
till
it
is
found
out
that
every
body
knows
them
.
<EOS>
Only
let
me
be
told
when
I
may
speak
out
.
 
<EOS>
I
wonder
whether
Jane
has
any
suspicion
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
went
to
Highbury
the
next
morning
,
and
satisfied
himself
on
that
point
.
<EOS>
He
told
her
the
news
.
<EOS>
Was
not
she
like
a
daughter
,
his
eldest
daughter
?
 
<EOS>
he
must
tell
her
;
and
Miss
Bates
being
present
,
it
passed
,
of
course
,
to
Mrs.
Cole
,
Mrs.
Perry
,
and
Mrs.
Elton
,
immediately
afterwards
.
<EOS>
It
was
no
more
than
the
principals
were
prepared
for
;
they
had
calculated
from
the
time
of
its
being
known
at
Randalls
,
how
soon
it
would
be
over
Highbury
;
and
were
thinking
of
themselves
,
as
the
evening
wonder
in
many
a
family
circle
,
with
great
sagacity
.
  
<EOS>
In
general
,
it
was
a
very
well
approved
match
.
<EOS>
Some
might
think
him
,
and
others
might
think
her
,
the
most
in
luck
.
<EOS>
One
set
might
recommend
their
all
removing
to
Donwell
,
and
leaving
Hartfield
for
the
John
Knightleys
;
and
another
might
predict
disagreements
among
their
servants
;
but
yet
,
upon
the
whole
,
there
was
no
serious
objection
raised
,
except
in
one
habitation
,
the
Vicarage
.
 
<EOS>
There
,
the
surprize
was
not
softened
by
any
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Elton
cared
little
about
it
,
compared
with
his
wife
;
he
only
hoped
"
the
young
lady
's
pride
would
now
be
contented
;
"
and
supposed
"
she
had
always
meant
to
catch
Knightley
if
she
could
;
"
and
,
on
the
point
of
living
at
Hartfield
,
could
daringly
exclaim
,
"
Rather
he
than
I
!
"
 
<EOS>
But
Mrs.
Elton
was
very
much
discomposed
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
"
Poor
Knightley
!
<EOS>
poor
fellow
!
 
<EOS>
sad
business
for
him
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
She
was
extremely
concerned
;
for
,
though
very
eccentric
,
he
had
a
thousand
good
qualities
.
 
<EOS>
How
could
he
be
so
taken
in
?
 
<EOS>
Did
not
think
him
at
all
in
love
 
not
in
the
least
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
Knightley
!
 
<EOS>
There
would
be
an
end
of
all
pleasant
intercourse
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
How
happy
he
had
been
to
come
and
dine
with
them
whenever
they
asked
him
!
<EOS>
But
that
would
be
all
over
now
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
fellow
!
 
<EOS>
No
more
exploring
parties
to
Donwell
made
for
_
her
_
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
no
;
there
would
be
a
Mrs.
Knightley
to
throw
cold
water
on
every
thing
.
 
<EOS>
Extremely
disagreeable
!
<EOS>
But
she
was
not
at
all
sorry
that
she
had
abused
the
housekeeper
the
other
day
.
 
<EOS>
Shocking
plan
,
living
together
.
<EOS>
It
would
never
do
.
<EOS>
She
knew
a
family
near
Maple
Grove
who
had
tried
it
,
and
been
obliged
to
separate
before
the
end
of
the
first
quarter
.
    
<EOS>
Time
passed
on
.
<EOS>
A
few
more
to
-
morrows
,
and
the
party
from
London
would
be
arriving
.
<EOS>
It
was
an
alarming
change
;
and
Emma
was
thinking
of
it
one
morning
,
as
what
must
bring
a
great
deal
to
agitate
and
grieve
her
,
when
Mr.
Knightley
came
in
,
and
distressing
thoughts
were
put
by
.
<EOS>
After
the
first
chat
of
pleasure
he
was
silent
;
and
then
,
in
a
graver
tone
,
began
with
,
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
something
to
tell
you
,
Emma
;
some
news
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Good
or
bad
?
<EOS>
"
said
she
,
quickly
,
looking
up
in
his
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
which
it
ought
to
be
called
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
good
<EOS>
I
am
sure
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
it
in
your
countenance
.
<EOS>
You
are
trying
not
to
smile
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
afraid
,
"
said
he
,
composing
his
features
,
"
I
am
very
much
afraid
,
my
dear
Emma
,
that
you
will
not
smile
when
you
hear
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Indeed
!
<EOS>
but
why
so
?
 
<EOS>
I
can
hardly
imagine
that
any
thing
which
pleases
or
amuses
you
,
should
not
please
and
amuse
me
too
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
one
subject
,
"
he
replied
,
"
I
hope
but
one
,
on
which
we
do
not
think
alike
.
"
<EOS>
He
paused
a
moment
,
again
smiling
,
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
her
face
.
<EOS>
"
Does
nothing
occur
to
you
?
 
<EOS>
Do
not
you
recollect
?
 
<EOS>
Harriet
Smith
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Her
cheeks
flushed
at
the
name
,
and
she
felt
afraid
of
something
,
though
she
knew
not
what
.
  
<EOS>
"
Have
you
heard
from
her
yourself
this
morning
?
"
cried
he
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
,
I
believe
,
and
know
the
whole
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
have
not
;
I
know
nothing
;
pray
tell
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
prepared
for
the
worst
,
I
see
 
and
very
bad
it
is
.
<EOS>
Harriet
Smith
marries
Robert
Martin
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
gave
a
start
,
which
did
not
seem
like
being
prepared
 
and
her
eyes
,
in
eager
gaze
,
said
,
"
No
,
this
is
impossible
!
"
<EOS>
but
her
lips
were
closed
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
so
,
indeed
,
"
continued
Mr.
Knightley
;
"
I
have
it
from
Robert
Martin
himself
.
<EOS>
He
left
me
not
half
an
hour
ago
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
was
still
looking
at
him
with
the
most
speaking
amazement
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
like
it
,
my
Emma
,
as
little
as
I
feared
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
our
opinions
were
the
same
.
<EOS>
But
in
time
they
will
.
<EOS>
Time
,
you
may
be
sure
,
will
make
one
or
the
other
of
us
think
differently
;
and
,
in
the
meanwhile
,
we
need
not
talk
much
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
mistake
me
,
you
quite
mistake
me
,
"
she
replied
,
exerting
herself
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
that
such
a
circumstance
would
now
make
me
unhappy
,
but
I
can
not
believe
it
.
<EOS>
It
seems
an
impossibility
!
 
<EOS>
You
can
not
mean
to
say
,
that
Harriet
Smith
has
accepted
Robert
Martin
.
<EOS>
You
can
not
mean
that
he
has
even
proposed
to
her
again
 
yet
.
<EOS>
You
only
mean
,
that
he
intends
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
mean
that
he
has
done
it
,
"
answered
Mr.
Knightley
,
with
smiling
but
determined
decision
,
"
and
been
accepted
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Good
God
!
"
<EOS>
she
cried
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
!
"
 
<EOS>
Then
having
recourse
to
her
workbasket
,
in
excuse
for
leaning
down
her
face
,
and
concealing
all
the
exquisite
feelings
of
delight
and
entertainment
which
she
knew
she
must
be
expressing
,
she
added
,
"
Well
,
now
tell
me
every
thing
;
make
this
intelligible
to
me
.
<EOS>
How
,
where
,
when
?
 
<EOS>
Let
me
know
it
all
.
<EOS>
I
never
was
more
surprized
 
<EOS>
but
it
does
not
make
me
unhappy
<EOS>
,
I
assure
you
.
 
<EOS>
How
 
how
has
it
been
possible
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
very
simple
story
.
<EOS>
He
went
to
town
on
business
three
days
ago
,
and
I
got
him
to
take
charge
of
some
papers
which
I
was
wanting
to
send
to
John
.
 
<EOS>
He
delivered
these
papers
to
John
,
at
his
chambers
,
and
was
asked
by
him
to
join
their
party
the
same
evening
to
Astley
's
.
<EOS>
They
were
going
to
take
the
two
eldest
boys
to
Astley
's
.
<EOS>
The
party
was
to
be
our
brother
and
sister
,
Henry
,
John
 
and
Miss
Smith
.
<EOS>
My
friend
Robert
could
not
resist
.
<EOS>
They
called
for
him
in
their
way
;
were
all
extremely
amused
;
and
my
brother
asked
him
to
dine
with
them
the
next
day
 
which
he
did
 
and
in
the
course
of
that
visit
(
as
I
understand
)
<EOS>
he
found
an
opportunity
of
speaking
to
Harriet
;
and
certainly
did
not
speak
in
vain
.
 
<EOS>
She
made
him
,
by
her
acceptance
,
as
happy
even
as
he
is
deserving
.
<EOS>
He
came
down
by
yesterday
's
coach
,
and
was
with
me
this
morning
immediately
after
breakfast
,
to
report
his
proceedings
,
first
on
my
affairs
,
and
then
on
his
own
.
<EOS>
This
is
all
that
I
can
relate
of
the
how
,
where
,
and
when
.
<EOS>
Your
friend
Harriet
will
make
a
much
longer
history
when
you
see
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
will
give
you
all
the
minute
particulars
,
which
only
woman
's
language
can
make
interesting
.
 
<EOS>
In
our
communications
we
deal
only
in
the
great
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
I
must
say
,
that
Robert
Martin
's
heart
seemed
for
_
him
_
,
and
to
_
<EOS>
me
_
,
<EOS>
very
overflowing
;
and
that
he
did
mention
,
without
its
being
much
to
the
purpose
,
that
on
quitting
their
box
at
Astley
's
,
my
brother
took
charge
of
Mrs.
John
Knightley
and
little
John
,
and
he
followed
with
Miss
Smith
and
Henry
;
and
that
at
one
time
they
were
in
such
a
crowd
,
as
to
make
Miss
Smith
rather
uneasy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
stopped
.
 
<EOS>
Emma
dared
not
attempt
any
immediate
reply
.
<EOS>
To
speak
,
she
was
sure
would
be
to
betray
a
most
unreasonable
degree
of
happiness
.
<EOS>
She
must
wait
a
moment
,
or
he
would
think
her
mad
.
<EOS>
Her
silence
disturbed
him
;
and
after
observing
her
a
little
while
,
he
added
,
  
"
Emma
,
my
love
<EOS>
,
you
said
that
this
circumstance
would
not
now
make
you
unhappy
;
but
I
am
afraid
it
gives
you
more
pain
than
you
expected
.
<EOS>
His
situation
is
an
evil
 
<EOS>
but
you
must
consider
it
as
what
satisfies
your
friend
;
and
I
will
answer
for
your
thinking
better
and
better
of
him
as
you
know
him
more
.
<EOS>
His
good
sense
and
good
principles
would
delight
you
.
 
<EOS>
As
far
as
the
man
is
concerned
,
you
could
not
wish
your
friend
in
better
hands
.
<EOS>
His
rank
in
society
I
would
alter
if
I
could
,
which
is
saying
a
great
deal
I
assure
you
,
Emma
.
 
<EOS>
You
laugh
at
me
about
William
Larkins
;
but
I
could
quite
as
ill
spare
Robert
Martin
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
wanted
her
to
look
up
and
smile
;
and
having
now
brought
herself
not
to
smile
too
broadly
 
<EOS>
she
did
 
cheerfully
answering
,
  
<EOS>
"
You
need
not
be
at
any
pains
to
reconcile
me
to
the
match
.
<EOS>
I
think
Harriet
is
doing
extremely
well
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
Her
_
connexions
may
be
worse
than
_
his
_
.
<EOS>
In
respectability
of
character
,
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
they
are
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
silent
from
surprize
merely
,
excessive
surprize
.
<EOS>
You
can
not
imagine
how
suddenly
it
has
come
on
me
!
<EOS>
how
peculiarly
unprepared
I
was
!
 
<EOS>
for
I
had
reason
to
believe
her
very
lately
more
determined
against
him
,
much
more
,
than
she
was
before
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
ought
to
know
your
friend
best
,
"
replied
Mr.
Knightley
;
"
but
I
should
say
she
was
a
good
-
tempered
,
soft
-
hearted
girl
,
not
likely
to
be
very
,
very
determined
against
any
young
man
who
told
her
he
loved
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
could
not
help
laughing
as
she
answered
,
"
Upon
my
word
,
I
believe
you
know
her
quite
as
well
as
I
do
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
Mr.
Knightley
,
are
you
perfectly
sure
that
she
has
absolutely
and
downright
_
accepted
_
him
.
<EOS>
I
could
suppose
she
might
in
time
 
<EOS>
but
can
she
already
?
 
<EOS>
Did
not
you
misunderstand
him
?
 
<EOS>
You
were
both
talking
of
other
things
;
of
business
,
shows
of
cattle
,
or
new
drills
 
and
might
not
you
,
in
the
confusion
of
so
many
subjects
,
mistake
him
?
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
Harriet
's
hand
that
he
was
certain
of
 
<EOS>
it
was
the
dimensions
of
some
famous
ox
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
contrast
between
the
countenance
and
air
of
Mr.
Knightley
and
Robert
Martin
was
,
at
this
moment
,
so
strong
to
Emma
's
feelings
,
and
so
strong
was
the
recollection
of
all
that
had
so
recently
passed
on
Harriet
's
side
,
so
fresh
<EOS>
the
sound
of
those
words
,
spoken
with
such
emphasis
,
"
<EOS>
No
,
I
hope
I
know
better
than
to
think
of
Robert
Martin
,
"
that
she
was
really
expecting
the
intelligence
to
prove
,
in
some
measure
,
premature
.
<EOS>
It
could
not
be
otherwise
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
dare
say
this
?
"
cried
Mr.
Knightley
.
<EOS>
"
Do
you
dare
to
suppose
me
so
great
a
blockhead
,
as
not
to
know
what
a
man
is
talking
of
?
 
<EOS>
What
do
you
deserve
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
I
always
deserve
the
best
treatment
,
because
I
never
put
up
with
any
other
;
and
,
therefore
,
you
must
give
me
a
plain
,
direct
answer
.
<EOS>
Are
you
quite
sure
that
you
understand
the
terms
on
which
Mr.
Martin
and
Harriet
now
are
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
quite
sure
,
"
he
replied
,
speaking
very
distinctly
,
"
that
he
told
me
she
had
accepted
him
;
and
that
there
was
no
obscurity
,
nothing
doubtful
,
in
the
words
he
used
;
and
I
think
I
can
give
you
a
proof
that
it
must
be
so
.
<EOS>
He
asked
my
opinion
as
to
what
he
was
now
to
do
.
<EOS>
He
knew
of
no
one
but
Mrs.
Goddard
to
whom
he
could
apply
for
information
of
her
relations
or
friends
.
<EOS>
Could
I
mention
any
thing
more
fit
to
be
done
,
than
to
go
to
Mrs.
Goddard
?
<EOS>
I
assured
him
that
I
could
not
.
<EOS>
Then
,
he
said
,
he
would
endeavour
to
see
her
in
the
course
of
this
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
perfectly
satisfied
,
"
replied
Emma
,
with
the
brightest
smiles
,
"
and
most
sincerely
wish
them
happy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
materially
changed
since
we
talked
on
this
subject
before
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
<EOS>
so
 
for
at
that
time
I
was
a
fool
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
am
changed
also
;
for
I
am
now
very
willing
to
grant
you
all
Harriet
's
good
qualities
.
<EOS>
I
have
taken
some
pains
for
your
sake
,
and
for
Robert
Martin
's
sake
,
(
whom
I
have
always
had
reason
to
believe
as
much
in
love
with
her
as
ever
,
)
to
get
acquainted
with
her
.
<EOS>
I
have
often
talked
to
her
a
good
deal
.
<EOS>
You
must
have
seen
that
I
did
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
,
indeed
,
I
have
thought
you
were
half
suspecting
me
of
pleading
poor
Martin
's
cause
,
which
was
never
the
case
;
but
,
from
all
my
observations
,
I
am
convinced
of
her
being
an
artless
,
amiable
girl
,
with
very
good
notions
,
very
seriously
good
principles
,
and
placing
her
happiness
in
the
affections
and
utility
of
domestic
life
.
 
<EOS>
Much
of
this
,
I
have
no
doubt
,
she
may
thank
you
for
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Me
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Emma
,
shaking
her
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
poor
Harriet
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
checked
herself
,
however
,
and
submitted
quietly
to
a
little
more
praise
than
she
deserved
.
  
<EOS>
Their
conversation
was
soon
afterwards
closed
by
the
entrance
of
her
father
.
<EOS>
She
was
not
sorry
.
<EOS>
She
wanted
to
be
alone
.
<EOS>
Her
mind
was
in
a
state
of
flutter
and
wonder
,
which
made
it
impossible
for
her
to
be
collected
.
<EOS>
She
was
in
dancing
,
singing
,
exclaiming
spirits
;
and
till
she
had
moved
about
,
and
talked
to
herself
,
and
laughed
and
reflected
,
she
could
be
fit
for
nothing
rational
.
  
<EOS>
Her
father
's
business
was
to
announce
James
's
being
gone
out
to
put
the
horses
to
,
preparatory
to
their
now
daily
drive
to
Randalls
;
and
she
had
,
therefore
,
an
immediate
excuse
for
disappearing
.
  
<EOS>
The
joy
,
the
gratitude
,
the
exquisite
delight
of
her
sensations
may
be
imagined
.
<EOS>
The
sole
grievance
and
alloy
thus
removed
in
the
prospect
of
Harriet
's
welfare
,
she
was
really
in
danger
of
becoming
too
happy
for
security
.
 
<EOS>
What
had
she
to
wish
for
?
<EOS>
Nothing
,
but
to
grow
more
worthy
of
him
,
whose
intentions
and
judgment
had
been
ever
so
superior
to
her
own
.
<EOS>
Nothing
,
but
that
the
lessons
of
her
past
folly
might
teach
her
humility
and
circumspection
in
future
.
  
<EOS>
Serious
she
was
,
very
serious
in
her
thankfulness
,
and
in
her
resolutions
;
and
<EOS>
yet
there
was
no
preventing
a
laugh
,
sometimes
in
the
very
midst
of
them
.
<EOS>
She
must
laugh
at
such
a
close
!
<EOS>
Such
an
end
of
the
doleful
disappointment
of
five
weeks
back
!
<EOS>
Such
a
heart
 
such
a
Harriet
!
  
<EOS>
Now
there
would
be
pleasure
in
her
returning
 
<EOS>
Every
thing
would
be
a
pleasure
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
a
great
pleasure
to
know
Robert
Martin
.
  
<EOS>
High
in
the
rank
of
her
most
serious
and
heartfelt
felicities
,
was
the
reflection
that
all
necessity
of
concealment
from
Mr.
Knightley
would
soon
be
over
.
<EOS>
The
disguise
,
equivocation
,
mystery
,
so
hateful
to
her
to
practise
,
might
soon
be
over
.
<EOS>
She
could
now
look
forward
to
giving
him
that
full
and
perfect
confidence
which
her
disposition
was
most
ready
to
welcome
as
a
duty
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
gayest
and
happiest
spirits
she
set
forward
with
her
father
;
not
always
listening
,
but
always
agreeing
to
what
he
said
;
and
,
whether
in
speech
or
silence
,
conniving
at
the
comfortable
persuasion
of
his
being
obliged
to
go
to
Randalls
every
day
,
or
poor
Mrs.
Weston
would
be
disappointed
.
  
<EOS>
They
arrived
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Weston
was
alone
in
the
drawing
-
room
:
 
but
hardly
had
they
been
told
of
the
baby
,
and
Mr.
Woodhouse
received
the
thanks
for
coming
,
which
he
asked
for
,
when
a
glimpse
was
caught
through
the
blind
,
of
two
figures
passing
near
the
window
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
Frank
and
Miss
Fairfax
,
"
said
Mrs.
Weston
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
just
going
to
tell
you
of
our
agreeable
surprize
in
seeing
him
arrive
this
morning
.
<EOS>
He
stays
till
to
-
morrow
,
and
Miss
Fairfax
has
been
persuaded
to
spend
the
day
with
us
.
 
<EOS>
They
are
coming
in
,
I
hope
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
In
half
a
minute
they
were
in
the
room
.
<EOS>
Emma
was
extremely
glad
to
see
him
 
<EOS>
but
there
was
a
degree
of
confusion
 
<EOS>
a
number
of
embarrassing
recollections
on
each
side
.
<EOS>
They
met
readily
and
smiling
,
but
with
a
consciousness
which
at
first
allowed
little
to
be
said
;
and
having
all
sat
down
again
,
there
was
for
some
time
such
a
blank
in
the
circle
,
that
Emma
began
to
doubt
whether
the
wish
now
indulged
,
which
she
had
long
felt
,
of
seeing
Frank
Churchill
once
more
,
and
of
seeing
him
with
Jane
,
would
yield
its
proportion
of
pleasure
.
<EOS>
When
Mr.
Weston
joined
the
party
,
however
,
and
when
the
baby
was
fetched
,
there
was
no
longer
a
want
of
subject
or
animation
 
or
of
courage
and
opportunity
for
Frank
Churchill
to
draw
near
her
and
say
,
  
"
I
have
to
thank
you
,
Miss
Woodhouse
,
for
a
very
kind
forgiving
message
in
one
of
Mrs.
Weston
's
letters
.
<EOS>
I
hope
time
has
not
made
you
less
willing
to
pardon
.
<EOS>
I
hope
you
do
not
retract
what
you
then
said
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
No
,
indeed
,
"
cried
Emma
,
most
happy
to
begin
,
"
not
in
the
least
.
<EOS>
I
am
particularly
glad
to
see
and
shake
hands
with
you
 
and
to
give
you
joy
in
person
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
thanked
her
with
all
his
heart
,
and
continued
some
time
to
speak
with
serious
feeling
of
his
gratitude
and
happiness
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
not
she
looking
well
?
<EOS>
"
said
he
,
turning
his
eyes
towards
Jane
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Better
than
she
ever
used
to
do
?
 
<EOS>
You
see
how
my
father
and
Mrs.
Weston
doat
upon
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
But
his
spirits
were
soon
rising
again
,
and
with
laughing
eyes
,
after
mentioning
the
expected
return
of
the
Campbells
,
he
named
the
name
of
Dixon
.
 
<EOS>
Emma
blushed
,
and
forbade
its
being
pronounced
in
her
hearing
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
never
think
of
it
,
"
she
cried
,
"
without
extreme
shame
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
shame
,
"
he
answered
,
"
is
all
mine
,
or
ought
to
be
.
<EOS>
But
is
it
possible
that
you
had
no
suspicion
?
 
<EOS>
I
mean
of
late
.
<EOS>
Early
,
I
know
,
you
had
none
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
had
the
smallest
,
I
assure
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
appears
quite
wonderful
.
<EOS>
I
was
once
very
near
 
<EOS>
and
I
wish
I
had
 
<EOS>
it
would
have
been
better
.
<EOS>
But
though
I
was
always
doing
wrong
things
,
they
were
very
bad
wrong
things
,
and
such
as
did
me
no
service
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
have
been
a
much
better
transgression
<EOS>
had
I
broken
the
bond
of
secrecy
and
told
you
every
thing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
now
worth
a
regret
,
"
said
Emma
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
some
hope
,
"
resumed
he
,
"
of
my
uncle
's
being
persuaded
to
pay
a
visit
at
Randalls
;
he
wants
to
be
introduced
to
her
.
<EOS>
When
the
Campbells
are
returned
,
we
shall
meet
them
in
London
,
and
continue
there
,
I
trust
,
till
we
may
carry
her
northward
.
 
<EOS>
But
now
,
I
am
at
such
a
distance
from
her
 
<EOS>
is
not
it
hard
,
Miss
Woodhouse
?
 
<EOS>
Till
this
morning
,
we
have
not
once
met
since
the
day
of
reconciliation
.
<EOS>
Do
not
you
pity
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
spoke
her
pity
so
very
kindly
,
that
with
a
sudden
accession
of
gay
thought
,
he
cried
,
  
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
by
the
bye
,
"
then
sinking
his
voice
,
and
looking
demure
for
the
moment
 
<EOS>
"
I
hope
Mr.
Knightley
is
well
?
"
<EOS>
He
paused
.
 
<EOS>
She
coloured
and
laughed
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
you
saw
my
letter
,
and
think
you
may
remember
my
wish
in
your
favour
.
<EOS>
Let
me
return
your
congratulations
.
 
<EOS>
I
assure
you
that
I
have
heard
the
news
with
the
warmest
interest
and
satisfaction
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
a
man
whom
I
can
not
presume
to
praise
.
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
was
delighted
,
and
only
wanted
him
to
go
on
in
the
same
style
;
but
his
mind
was
the
next
moment
in
his
own
concerns
and
with
his
own
Jane
,
and
his
next
words
were
,
  
"
Did
you
ever
see
such
a
skin
?
 
<EOS>
such
smoothness
!
<EOS>
such
delicacy
!
 
<EOS>
and
yet
without
being
actually
fair
.
 
<EOS>
One
can
not
call
her
fair
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
most
uncommon
complexion
,
with
her
dark
eye
-
lashes
and
hair
 
a
most
distinguishing
complexion
!
<EOS>
So
peculiarly
the
lady
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
Just
colour
enough
for
beauty
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
always
admired
her
complexion
,
"
replied
Emma
,
archly
;
"
but
do
not
I
remember
the
time
when
you
found
fault
with
her
for
being
so
pale
?
 
<EOS>
When
we
first
began
to
talk
of
her
.
 
<EOS>
Have
you
quite
forgotten
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
no
 
<EOS>
what
an
impudent
dog
<EOS>
I
was
!
 
<EOS>
How
could
I
dare
 
"
  
<EOS>
But
he
laughed
so
heartily
at
the
recollection
,
that
Emma
could
not
help
saying
,
  
"
I
do
suspect
that
in
the
midst
of
your
perplexities
at
that
time
,
you
had
very
great
amusement
in
tricking
us
all
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
sure
you
had
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
sure
it
was
a
consolation
to
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
no
,
no
,
no
 
<EOS>
how
can
you
suspect
me
of
such
a
thing
?
<EOS>
I
was
the
most
miserable
wretch
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
quite
so
miserable
as
to
be
insensible
to
mirth
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
it
was
a
source
of
high
entertainment
to
you
,
to
feel
that
you
were
taking
us
all
in
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
I
am
the
readier
to
suspect
,
because
,
to
tell
you
the
truth
,
I
think
it
might
have
been
some
amusement
to
myself
in
the
same
situation
.
<EOS>
I
think
there
is
a
little
likeness
between
us
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
bowed
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
not
in
our
dispositions
,
"
she
presently
added
,
with
a
look
of
true
sensibility
,
"
there
is
a
likeness
in
our
destiny
;
the
destiny
which
bids
fair
to
connect
us
with
two
characters
so
much
superior
to
our
own
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
True
,
true
,
"
he
answered
,
warmly
.
"
<EOS>
No
,
not
true
on
your
side
.
<EOS>
You
can
have
no
superior
,
but
most
true
on
mine
.
 
<EOS>
She
is
a
complete
angel
.
<EOS>
Look
at
her
.
<EOS>
Is
not
she
an
angel
in
every
gesture
?
<EOS>
Observe
the
turn
of
her
throat
.
<EOS>
Observe
her
eyes
,
as
she
is
looking
up
at
my
father
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
be
glad
to
hear
(
inclining
his
head
,
and
whispering
seriously
)
that
my
uncle
means
to
give
her
all
my
aunt
's
jewels
.
<EOS>
They
are
to
be
new
set
.
<EOS>
I
am
resolved
to
have
some
in
an
ornament
for
the
head
.
<EOS>
Will
not
it
be
beautiful
in
her
dark
hair
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Very
beautiful
,
indeed
,
"
replied
Emma
;
and
she
spoke
so
kindly
,
that
he
gratefully
burst
out
,
  
<EOS>
"
How
delighted
I
am
to
see
you
again
!
<EOS>
and
to
see
you
in
such
excellent
looks
!
 
<EOS>
I
would
not
have
missed
this
meeting
for
the
world
.
<EOS>
I
should
certainly
have
called
at
Hartfield
,
had
you
failed
to
come
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
others
had
been
talking
of
the
child
,
Mrs.
Weston
giving
an
account
of
a
little
alarm
she
had
been
under
,
the
evening
before
,
from
the
infant
's
appearing
not
quite
well
.
<EOS>
She
believed
she
had
been
foolish
,
but
it
had
alarmed
her
,
and
she
had
been
within
half
a
minute
of
sending
for
Mr.
Perry
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
she
ought
to
be
ashamed
,
but
Mr.
Weston
had
been
almost
as
uneasy
as
herself
.
 
<EOS>
In
ten
minutes
,
however
,
the
child
had
been
perfectly
well
again
.
<EOS>
This
was
her
history
;
and
particularly
interesting
it
was
to
Mr.
Woodhouse
,
who
commended
her
very
much
for
thinking
of
sending
for
Perry
,
and
only
regretted
that
she
had
not
done
it
.
<EOS>
"
She
should
always
send
for
Perry
,
if
the
child
appeared
in
the
slightest
degree
disordered
,
were
it
only
for
a
moment
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
be
too
soon
alarmed
,
nor
send
for
Perry
too
often
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
pity
,
perhaps
,
that
he
had
not
come
last
night
;
for
,
though
the
child
seemed
well
now
,
very
well
considering
,
it
would
probably
have
been
better
if
Perry
had
seen
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Frank
Churchill
caught
the
name
.
  
<EOS>
"
Perry
!
"
said
he
to
Emma
,
and
trying
,
as
he
spoke
,
to
catch
Miss
Fairfax
's
eye
.
<EOS>
"
My
friend
Mr.
Perry
!
<EOS>
What
are
they
saying
about
Mr.
Perry
?
 
<EOS>
Has
he
been
here
this
morning
?
 
<EOS>
And
how
does
he
travel
now
?
 
<EOS>
Has
he
set
up
his
carriage
?
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
soon
recollected
,
and
understood
him
;
and
while
she
joined
in
the
laugh
,
it
was
evident
from
Jane
's
countenance
that
she
too
was
really
hearing
him
,
though
trying
to
seem
deaf
.
  
<EOS>
"
Such
an
extraordinary
dream
of
mine
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
never
think
of
it
without
laughing
.
 
<EOS>
She
hears
us
,
she
hears
us
,
Miss
Woodhouse
.
<EOS>
I
see
it
in
her
cheek
,
her
smile
,
her
vain
attempt
to
frown
.
<EOS>
Look
at
her
.
<EOS>
Do
not
you
see
that
,
at
this
instant
,
the
very
passage
of
her
own
letter
,
which
sent
me
the
report
,
is
passing
under
her
eye
 
that
the
whole
blunder
is
spread
before
her
 
that
she
can
attend
to
nothing
else
,
though
pretending
to
listen
to
the
others
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Jane
was
forced
to
smile
completely
,
for
a
moment
;
and
the
smile
partly
remained
as
she
turned
towards
him
,
and
said
in
a
conscious
,
low
,
yet
steady
voice
,
  
<EOS>
"
How
you
can
bear
such
recollections
,
is
astonishing
to
me
!
 
<EOS>
They
_
will
_
sometimes
obtrude
 
<EOS>
but
how
you
can
court
them
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
had
a
great
deal
to
say
in
return
,
and
very
entertainingly
;
but
Emma
's
feelings
were
chiefly
with
Jane
,
in
the
argument
;
and
on
leaving
Randalls
,
and
falling
naturally
into
a
comparison
of
the
two
men
,
she
felt
,
that
pleased
as
she
had
been
to
see
Frank
Churchill
,
and
really
regarding
him
as
she
did
with
friendship
,
she
had
never
been
more
sensible
of
Mr.
Knightley
's
high
superiority
of
character
.
<EOS>
The
happiness
of
this
most
happy
day
,
received
its
completion
,
in
the
animated
contemplation
of
his
worth
which
this
comparison
produced
.
    
<EOS>
If
Emma
had
still
,
at
intervals
,
an
anxious
feeling
for
Harriet
,
a
momentary
doubt
of
its
being
possible
for
her
to
be
really
cured
of
her
attachment
to
Mr.
Knightley
,
and
really
able
to
accept
another
man
from
unbiased
inclination
,
it
was
not
long
that
she
had
to
suffer
from
the
recurrence
of
any
such
uncertainty
.
<EOS>
A
very
few
days
brought
the
party
from
London
,
and
she
had
no
sooner
an
opportunity
of
being
one
hour
alone
with
Harriet
,
than
she
became
perfectly
satisfied
 
unaccountable
as
it
was
!
 
<EOS>
that
Robert
Martin
had
thoroughly
supplanted
Mr.
Knightley
,
and
was
now
forming
all
her
views
of
happiness
.
  
<EOS>
Harriet
was
a
little
distressed
 
<EOS>
did
look
a
little
foolish
at
first
:
but
having
once
owned
that
she
had
been
presumptuous
and
silly
,
and
self
-
deceived
,
before
,
her
pain
and
confusion
seemed
to
die
away
with
the
words
,
and
leave
her
without
a
care
for
the
past
,
and
with
the
fullest
exultation
in
the
present
and
future
;
for
,
as
to
her
friend
's
approbation
,
Emma
had
instantly
removed
every
fear
of
that
nature
,
by
meeting
her
with
the
most
unqualified
congratulations
.
 
<EOS>
Harriet
was
most
happy
to
give
every
particular
of
the
evening
at
Astley
's
,
and
the
dinner
the
next
day
;
she
could
dwell
on
it
all
with
the
utmost
delight
.
<EOS>
But
what
did
such
particulars
explain
?
 
<EOS>
The
fact
was
,
as
Emma
could
now
acknowledge
,
that
Harriet
had
always
liked
Robert
Martin
;
and
that
his
continuing
to
love
her
had
been
irresistible
.
 
<EOS>
Beyond
this
,
it
must
ever
be
unintelligible
to
Emma
.
  
<EOS>
The
event
,
however
,
was
most
joyful
;
and
every
day
was
giving
her
fresh
reason
for
thinking
so
.
 
<EOS>
Harriet
's
parentage
became
known
.
<EOS>
She
proved
to
be
the
daughter
of
a
tradesman
,
rich
enough
to
afford
her
the
comfortable
maintenance
which
had
ever
been
hers
,
and
decent
enough
to
have
always
wished
for
concealment
.
 
<EOS>
Such
was
the
blood
of
gentility
which
Emma
had
formerly
been
so
ready
to
vouch
for
!
 
<EOS>
It
was
likely
to
be
as
untainted
,
perhaps
,
as
the
blood
of
many
a
gentleman
:
but
what
a
connexion
had
she
been
preparing
for
Mr.
Knightley
 
or
for
the
Churchills
 
or
even
for
Mr.
Elton
!
 
<EOS>
The
stain
of
illegitimacy
,
unbleached
by
nobility
or
wealth
,
would
have
been
a
stain
indeed
.
  
<EOS>
No
objection
was
raised
on
the
father
's
side
;
the
young
man
was
treated
liberally
;
it
was
all
as
it
should
be
:
and
as
Emma
became
acquainted
with
Robert
Martin
,
who
was
now
introduced
at
Hartfield
,
she
fully
acknowledged
in
him
all
the
appearance
of
sense
and
worth
which
could
bid
fairest
for
her
little
friend
.
<EOS>
She
had
no
doubt
of
Harriet
's
happiness
with
any
good
-
tempered
man
;
but
with
him
,
and
in
the
home
he
offered
,
there
would
be
the
hope
of
more
,
of
security
,
stability
,
and
improvement
.
<EOS>
She
would
be
placed
in
the
midst
of
those
who
loved
her
,
and
who
had
better
sense
than
herself
;
retired
enough
for
safety
,
and
occupied
enough
for
cheerfulness
.
<EOS>
She
would
be
never
led
into
temptation
,
nor
left
for
it
to
find
her
out
.
<EOS>
She
would
be
respectable
and
happy
;
and
Emma
admitted
her
to
be
the
luckiest
creature
in
the
world
,
to
have
created
so
steady
and
persevering
an
affection
in
such
a
man
;
 
or
,
if
not
quite
the
luckiest
,
to
yield
only
to
herself
.
  
<EOS>
Harriet
,
necessarily
drawn
away
by
her
engagements
with
the
Martins
,
was
less
and
less
at
Hartfield
;
which
was
not
to
be
regretted
.
 
<EOS>
The
intimacy
between
her
and
Emma
must
sink
;
their
friendship
must
change
into
a
calmer
sort
of
goodwill
;
and
,
fortunately
,
what
ought
to
be
,
and
must
be
,
seemed
already
beginning
,
and
in
the
most
gradual
,
natural
manner
.
  
<EOS>
Before
the
end
of
September
,
Emma
attended
Harriet
to
church
,
and
saw
her
hand
bestowed
on
Robert
Martin
with
so
complete
a
satisfaction
,
as
no
remembrances
,
even
connected
with
Mr.
Elton
as
he
stood
before
them
,
could
impair
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
,
indeed
,
at
that
time
she
scarcely
saw
Mr.
Elton
,
but
as
the
clergyman
whose
blessing
at
the
altar
might
next
fall
on
herself
.
 
<EOS>
Robert
Martin
and
Harriet
Smith
,
the
latest
couple
engaged
of
the
three
,
were
the
first
to
be
married
.
  
<EOS>
Jane
Fairfax
had
already
quitted
Highbury
,
and
was
restored
to
the
comforts
of
her
beloved
home
with
the
Campbells
.
 
<EOS>
The
Mr.
Churchills
were
also
in
town
;
and
they
were
only
waiting
for
November
.
  
<EOS>
The
intermediate
month
was
the
one
fixed
on
,
as
far
as
they
dared
,
by
Emma
and
Mr.
Knightley
.
 
<EOS>
They
had
determined
that
their
marriage
ought
to
be
concluded
while
John
and
Isabella
were
still
at
Hartfield
,
to
allow
them
the
fortnight
's
absence
in
a
tour
to
the
seaside
,
which
was
the
plan
.
 
<EOS>
John
and
Isabella
,
and
every
other
friend
,
were
agreed
in
approving
it
.
<EOS>
But
Mr.
Woodhouse
 
<EOS>
how
was
Mr.
Woodhouse
to
be
induced
to
consent
?
 
<EOS>
he
,
who
had
never
yet
alluded
to
their
marriage
<EOS>
but
as
a
distant
event
.
  
<EOS>
When
first
sounded
on
the
subject
,
he
was
so
miserable
,
that
they
were
almost
hopeless
.
 
<EOS>
A
second
allusion
,
indeed
,
gave
less
pain
.
 
<EOS>
He
began
to
think
it
was
to
be
,
and
that
he
could
not
prevent
it
 
a
very
promising
step
of
the
mind
on
its
way
to
resignation
.
<EOS>
Still
,
however
,
he
was
not
happy
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
he
appeared
so
much
otherwise
,
that
his
daughter
's
courage
failed
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
bear
to
see
him
suffering
,
to
know
him
fancying
himself
neglected
;
and
though
her
understanding
almost
acquiesced
in
the
assurance
of
both
the
Mr.
Knightleys
,
that
when
once
the
event
were
over
,
his
distress
would
be
soon
over
too
,
she
hesitated
 
<EOS>
she
could
not
proceed
.
  
<EOS>
In
this
state
of
suspense
they
were
befriended
,
not
by
any
sudden
illumination
of
Mr.
Woodhouse
's
mind
,
or
any
wonderful
change
of
his
nervous
system
,
but
by
the
operation
of
the
same
system
in
another
way
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Weston
's
poultry
-
house
was
robbed
one
night
of
all
her
turkeys
 
evidently
by
the
ingenuity
of
man
.
<EOS>
Other
poultry
-
yards
in
the
neighbourhood
also
suffered
.
 
<EOS>
Pilfering
was
_
housebreaking
_
to
Mr.
Woodhouse
's
fears
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
very
uneasy
;
and
<EOS>
but
for
the
sense
of
his
son
-
in
-
law
's
protection
,
would
have
been
under
wretched
alarm
every
night
of
his
life
.
<EOS>
The
strength
,
resolution
,
and
presence
of
mind
of
the
Mr.
Knightleys
,
commanded
his
fullest
dependence
.
<EOS>
While
either
of
them
protected
him
and
his
,
Hartfield
was
safe
.
 
<EOS>
But
Mr.
John
Knightley
must
be
in
London
again
by
the
end
of
the
first
week
in
November
.
  
<EOS>
The
result
of
this
distress
was
,
that
,
with
a
much
more
voluntary
,
cheerful
consent
than
his
daughter
had
ever
presumed
to
hope
for
at
the
moment
,
she
was
able
to
fix
her
wedding
-
day
 
and
Mr.
Elton
was
called
on
,
within
a
month
from
the
marriage
of
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Robert
Martin
,
to
join
the

The
wedding
was
very
much
like
other
weddings
,
where
the
parties
have
no
taste
for
finery
or
parade
;
and
Mrs.
Elton
,
from
the
particulars
detailed
by
her
husband
,
thought
it
all
extremely
shabby
,
and
very
inferior
to
her
own
.
 
<EOS>
"
Very
little
white
satin
,
very
few
lace
veils
;
a
most
pitiful
business
!
 
<EOS>
Selina
would
stare
when
she
heard
of
it
.

But
,
in
spite
of
these
deficiencies
,
the
wishes
,
the
hopes
,
the
confidence
,
the
predictions
of
the
small
band
of
true
friends
who
witnessed
the
ceremony
,
were
fully
answered
in
the
perfect
happiness
of
the
union
.
