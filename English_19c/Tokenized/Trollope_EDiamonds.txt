Lizzie
Greystock
 
<EOS>
It
was
admitted
by
all
her
friends
,
and
also
by
her
enemies
,
 
who
were
in
truth
the
more
numerous
and
active
body
of
the
two
,
 
that
Lizzie
Greystock
had
done
very
well
with
herself
.
<EOS>
We
will
tell
the
story
of
Lizzie
Greystock
from
the
beginning
,
but
we
will
not
dwell
over
it
at
great
length
,
as
we
might
do
if
we
loved
her
.
<EOS>
She
was
the
only
child
of
old
Admiral
Greystock
,
who
in
the
latter
years
of
his
life
was
much
perplexed
by
the
possession
of
a
daughter
.
<EOS>
The
admiral
was
a
man
who
liked
whist
,
wine
,
 
and
wickedness
in
general
we
may
perhaps
say
,
and
whose
ambition
it
was
to
live
every
day
of
his
life
up
to
the
end
of
it
.
<EOS>
People
say
that
he
succeeded
,
and
that
the
whist
,
wine
,
and
wickedness
were
there
,
at
the
side
even
of
his
dying
bed
.
<EOS>
He
had
no
particular
fortune
,
and
yet
his
daughter
,
when
she
was
little
more
than
a
child
,
went
about
everywhere
with
jewels
on
her
fingers
,
and
red
gems
hanging
round
her
neck
,
and
yellow
gems
pendent
from
her
ears
,
and
white
gems
shining
in
her
black
hair
.
<EOS>
She
was
hardly
nineteen
when
her
father
died
and
she
was
taken
home
by
that
dreadful
old
termagant
,
her
aunt
,
Lady
Linlithgow
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
would
have
sooner
gone
to
any
other
friend
or
relative
,
had
there
been
any
other
friend
or
relative
to
take
her
possessed
of
a
house
in
town
.
<EOS>
Her
uncle
,
Dean
Greystock
,
of
Bobsborough
,
would
have
had
her
,
and
a
more
good
-
natured
old
soul
than
the
dean
's
wife
did
not
exist
,
 
and
there
were
three
pleasant
,
good
-
tempered
girls
in
the
deanery
,
who
had
made
various
little
efforts
at
friendship
with
their
cousin
Lizzie
;
but
Lizzie
had
higher
ideas
for
herself
than
life
in
the
deanery
at
Bobsborough
.
<EOS>
She
hated
Lady
Linlithgow
.
<EOS>
During
her
father
's
lifetime
,
when
she
hoped
to
be
able
to
settle
herself
before
his
death
,
she
was
not
in
the
habit
of
concealing
her
hatred
for
Lady
Linlithgow
.
<EOS>
Lady
Linlithgow
was
not
indeed
amiable
or
easily
managed
.
<EOS>
But
when
the
admiral
died
,
Lizzie
did
not
hesitate
for
a
moment
in
going
to
the
old
"
vulturess
,
"
as
she
was
in
the
habit
of
calling
the
countess
in
her
occasional
correspondence
with
the
girls
at
Bobsborough
.
  
<EOS>
The
admiral
died
greatly
in
debt
;
 
so
much
so
that
it
was
a
marvel
how
tradesmen
had
trusted
him
.
<EOS>
There
was
literally
nothing
left
for
anybody
,
 
and
Messrs.
Harter
and
Benjamin
of
Old
Bond
Street
condescended
to
call
at
Lady
Linlithgow
's
house
in
Brook
Street
,
and
to
beg
that
the
jewels
supplied
during
the
last
twelve
months
might
be
returned
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
protested
that
there
were
no
jewels
,
 
nothing
to
signify
,
nothing
worth
restoring
.
<EOS>
Lady
Linlithgow
had
seen
the
diamonds
,
and
demanded
an
explanation
.
<EOS>
They
had
been
"
parted
with
,
"
by
the
admiral
's
orders
,
 
so
said
Lizzie
,
 
for
the
payment
of
other
debts
.
<EOS>
Of
this
Lady
Linlithgow
did
not
believe
a
word
,
but
she
could
not
get
at
any
exact
truth
.
<EOS>
At
that
moment
the
jewels
were
in
very
truth
pawned
for
money
which
had
been
necessary
for
Lizzie
's
needs
.
<EOS>
Certain
things
must
be
paid
for
,
 
one
's
own
maid
for
instance
;
and
one
must
have
some
money
in
one
's
pocket
for
railway
-
trains
and
little
knick
-
knacks
which
can
not
be
had
on
credit
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
when
she
was
nineteen
knew
how
to
do
without
money
as
well
as
most
girls
;
but
there
were
calls
which
she
could
not
withstand
,
debts
which
even
she
must
pay
.
  
<EOS>
She
did
not
,
however
,
drop
her
acquaintance
with
Messrs.
Harter
and
Benjamin
.
<EOS>
Before
her
father
had
been
dead
eight
months
,
she
was
closeted
with
Mr.
Benjamin
,
transacting
a
little
business
with
him
.
<EOS>
She
had
come
to
him
,
she
told
him
,
the
moment
she
was
of
age
,
and
was
willing
to
make
herself
responsible
for
the
debt
,
signing
any
bill
,
note
,
or
document
which
the
firm
might
demand
from
her
,
to
that
effect
.
<EOS>
Of
course
she
had
nothing
of
her
own
,
and
never
would
have
anything
.
<EOS>
That
Mr.
Benjamin
knew
.
<EOS>
As
for
payment
of
the
debt
by
Lady
Linlithgow
,
who
for
a
countess
was
as
poor
as
Job
,
Mr.
Benjamin
,
she
was
quite
sure
,
did
not
expect
anything
of
the
kind
.
<EOS>
But
 
Then
Lizzie
paused
,
and
Mr.
Benjamin
,
with
the
sweetest
and
wittiest
of
smiles
,
suggested
that
perhaps
Miss
Greystock
was
going
to
be
married
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
,
with
a
pretty
maiden
blush
,
admitted
that
such
a
catastrophe
was
probable
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
asked
in
marriage
by
Sir
Florian
Eustace
.
<EOS>
Now
Mr.
Benjamin
knew
,
as
all
the
world
knew
,
that
Sir
Florian
Eustace
was
a
very
rich
man
indeed
;
a
man
in
no
degree
embarrassed
,
and
who
could
pay
any
amount
of
jewellers
"
bills
for
which
claim
might
be
made
upon
him
.
<EOS>
Well
;
what
did
Miss
Greystock
want
?
<EOS>
Mr.
Benjamin
did
not
suppose
that
Miss
Greystock
was
actuated
simply
by
a
desire
to
have
her
old
bills
paid
by
her
future
husband
.
<EOS>
Miss
Greystock
wanted
a
loan
sufficient
to
take
the
jewels
out
of
pawn
.
<EOS>
She
would
then
make
herself
responsible
for
the
full
amount
due
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Benjamin
said
that
he
would
make
a
few
inquiries
.
"
<EOS>
But
you
wo
n't
betray
me
,
"
said
Lizzie
,
"
for
the
match
might
be
off
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Benjamin
promised
to
be
more
than
cautious
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
not
so
much
of
falsehood
as
might
have
been
expected
in
the
statement
which
Lizzie
Greystock
made
to
the
jeweller
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
true
that
she
was
of
age
,
and
therefore
no
future
husband
would
be
legally
liable
for
any
debt
which
she
might
then
contract
.
<EOS>
And
it
was
not
true
that
Sir
Florian
Eustace
had
asked
her
in
marriage
.
<EOS>
Those
two
little
blemishes
in
her
statement
must
be
admitted
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
true
that
Sir
Florian
was
at
her
feet
,
and
that
by
a
proper
use
of
her
various
charms
,
 
the
pawned
jewels
included
,
 
she
might
bring
him
to
an
offer
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Benjamin
made
his
inquiries
,
and
acceded
to
the
proposal
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
tell
Miss
Greystock
that
she
had
lied
to
him
in
that
matter
of
her
age
,
though
he
had
discovered
the
lie
.
<EOS>
Sir
Florian
would
no
doubt
pay
the
bill
for
his
wife
without
any
arguments
as
to
the
legality
of
the
claim
.
<EOS>
From
such
information
as
Mr.
Benjamin
could
acquire
he
thought
that
there
would
be
a
marriage
,
and
that
the
speculation
was
on
the
whole
in
his
favour
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
recovered
her
jewels
and
Mr.
Benjamin
was
in
possession
of
a
promissory
note
purporting
to
have
been
executed
by
a
person
who
was
no
longer
a
minor
.
<EOS>
The
jeweller
was
ultimately
successful
in
his
views
,
 
and
so
was
the
lady
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Linlithgow
saw
the
jewels
come
back
,
one
by
one
,
ring
added
to
ring
on
the
little
taper
fingers
,
the
rubies
for
the
neck
,
and
the
pendent
yellow
earrings
.
<EOS>
Though
Lizzie
was
in
mourning
for
her
father
,
still
these
things
were
allowed
to
be
visible
.
<EOS>
The
countess
was
not
the
woman
to
see
them
without
inquiry
,
and
she
inquired
vigorously
.
<EOS>
She
threatened
,
stormed
,
and
protested
.
<EOS>
She
attempted
even
a
raid
upon
the
young
lady
's
jewel
-
box
.
<EOS>
But
she
was
not
successful
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
snapped
and
snarled
and
held
her
own
,
 
for
at
that
time
the
match
with
Sir
Florian
was
near
its
accomplishment
,
and
the
countess
understood
too
well
the
value
of
such
a
disposition
of
her
niece
to
risk
it
at
the
moment
by
any
open
rupture
.
<EOS>
The
little
house
in
Brook
Street
,
 
for
the
house
was
very
small
and
very
comfortless
,
 
a
house
that
had
been
squeezed
in
,
as
it
were
,
between
two
others
without
any
fitting
space
for
it
,
 
did
not
contain
a
happy
family
.
<EOS>
One
bedroom
,
and
that
the
biggest
,
was
appropriated
to
the
Earl
of
Linlithgow
,
the
son
of
the
countess
,
a
young
man
who
passed
perhaps
five
nights
in
town
during
the
year
.
<EOS>
Other
inmate
there
was
none
besides
the
aunt
and
the
niece
and
the
four
servants
,
 
of
whom
one
was
Lizzie
's
own
maid
.
<EOS>
Why
should
such
a
countess
have
troubled
herself
with
the
custody
of
such
a
niece
?
<EOS>
Simply
because
the
countess
regarded
it
as
a
duty
.
<EOS>
Lady
Linlithgow
was
worldly
,
stingy
,
ill
-
tempered
,
selfish
,
and
mean
.
<EOS>
Lady
Linlithgow
would
cheat
a
butcher
out
of
a
mutton
-
chop
,
or
a
cook
out
of
a
month
's
wages
,
if
she
could
do
so
with
some
slant
of
legal
wind
in
her
favour
.
<EOS>
She
would
tell
any
number
of
lies
to
carry
a
point
in
what
she
believed
to
be
social
success
.
<EOS>
It
was
said
of
her
that
she
cheated
at
cards
.
<EOS>
In
back
-
biting
,
no
venomous
old
woman
between
Bond
Street
and
Park
Lane
could
beat
her
,
 
or
,
more
wonderful
still
,
no
venomous
old
man
at
the
clubs
.
<EOS>
But
nevertheless
she
recognised
certain
duties
,
 
and
performed
them
,
though
she
hated
them
.
<EOS>
She
went
to
church
,
not
merely
that
people
might
see
her
there
,
 
as
to
which
in
truth
she
cared
nothing
,
 
but
because
she
thought
it
was
right
.
<EOS>
And
she
took
in
Lizzie
Greystock
,
whom
she
hated
almost
as
much
as
she
did
sermons
,
because
the
admiral
's
wife
had
been
her
sister
,
and
she
recognised
a
duty
.
<EOS>
But
,
having
thus
bound
herself
to
Lizzie
,
 
who
was
a
beauty
,
 
of
course
it
became
the
first
object
of
her
life
to
get
rid
of
Lizzie
by
a
marriage
.
<EOS>
And
,
though
she
would
have
liked
to
think
that
Lizzie
would
be
tormented
all
her
days
,
though
she
thoroughly
believed
that
Lizzie
deserved
to
be
tormented
,
she
set
her
heart
upon
a
splendid
match
.
<EOS>
She
would
at
any
rate
be
able
to
throw
it
daily
in
her
niece
's
teeth
that
the
splendour
was
of
her
doing
.
<EOS>
Now
a
marriage
with
Sir
Florian
Eustace
would
be
very
splendid
,
and
therefore
she
was
unable
to
go
into
the
matter
of
the
jewels
with
that
rigour
which
in
other
circumstances
she
would
certainly
have
displayed
.
  
<EOS>
The
match
with
Sir
Florian
Eustace
,
 
for
a
match
<EOS>
it
came
to
be
,
 
was
certainly
very
splendid
.
<EOS>
Sir
Florian
was
a
young
man
about
eight
-
and
-
twenty
,
very
handsome
,
of
immense
wealth
,
quite
unencumbered
,
moving
in
the
best
circles
,
popular
,
so
far
prudent
that
he
never
risked
his
fortune
on
the
turf
or
in
gambling
-
houses
,
with
the
reputation
of
a
gallant
soldier
,
and
a
most
devoted
lover
.
<EOS>
There
were
two
facts
concerning
him
which
might
,
or
might
not
,
be
taken
as
objections
.
<EOS>
He
was
vicious
,
and
 
he
was
dying
.
<EOS>
When
a
friend
,
intending
to
be
kind
,
hinted
the
latter
circumstance
to
Lady
Linlithgow
,
the
countess
blinked
and
winked
and
nodded
,
and
then
swore
that
she
had
procured
medical
advice
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
Medical
advice
declared
that
Sir
Florian
was
not
more
likely
to
die
than
another
man
,
 
if
only
he
would
get
married
;
all
of
which
statement
on
her
ladyship
's
part
was
a
lie
.
<EOS>
When
the
same
friend
hinted
the
same
thing
to
Lizzie
herself
,
Lizzie
resolved
that
she
would
have
her
revenge
upon
that
friend
.
<EOS>
At
any
rate
the
courtship
went
on
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
said
that
Sir
Florian
was
vicious
;
 
but
he
was
not
altogether
a
bad
man
,
nor
was
he
vicious
in
the
common
sense
of
the
word
.
<EOS>
He
was
one
who
denied
himself
no
pleasure
,
let
the
cost
be
what
it
might
in
health
,
pocket
,
or
morals
.
<EOS>
Of
sin
or
wickedness
he
had
probably
no
distinct
idea
.
<EOS>
In
virtue
,
as
an
attribute
of
the
world
around
him
,
he
had
no
belief
.
<EOS>
Of
honour
he
thought
very
much
,
and
had
conceived
a
somewhat
noble
idea
that
because
much
had
been
given
to
him
much
was
demanded
of
him
.
<EOS>
He
was
haughty
,
polite
,
 
and
very
generous
.
<EOS>
There
was
almost
a
nobility
even
about
his
vices
.
<EOS>
And
he
had
a
special
gallantry
of
which
it
is
hard
to
say
whether
it
is
or
is
not
to
be
admired
.
<EOS>
They
told
him
that
he
was
like
to
die
,
 
very
like
to
die
,
if
he
did
not
change
his
manner
of
living
.
<EOS>
Would
he
go
to
Algiers
for
a
period
?
<EOS>
Certainly
not
.
<EOS>
He
would
do
no
such
thing
.
<EOS>
If
he
died
,
there
was
his
brother
John
left
to
succeed
him
.
<EOS>
And
the
fear
of
death
never
cast
a
cloud
over
that
grandly
beautiful
brow
.
<EOS>
They
had
all
been
short
-
lived
,
 
the
Eustaces
.
<EOS>
Consumption
had
swept
a
hecatomb
of
victims
from
the
family
.
<EOS>
But
still
they
were
grand
people
,
and
never
were
afraid
of
death
.
  
<EOS>
And
then
Sir
Florian
fell
in
love
.
<EOS>
Discussing
this
matter
with
his
brother
,
who
was
perhaps
his
only
intimate
friend
,
he
declared
that
if
the
girl
he
loved
would
give
herself
to
him
,
he
would
make
what
atonement
he
could
to
her
for
his
own
early
death
by
a
princely
settlement
.
<EOS>
John
Eustace
,
who
was
somewhat
nearly
concerned
in
the
matter
,
raised
no
objection
to
this
proposal
.
<EOS>
There
was
ever
something
grand
about
these
Eustaces
.
<EOS>
Sir
Florian
was
a
grand
gentleman
;
but
surely
he
must
have
been
dull
of
intellect
,
slow
of
discernment
,
blear
-
eyed
in
his
ways
about
the
town
,
<EOS>
when
he
took
Lizzie
Greystock
,
 
of
all
the
women
whom
he
could
find
in
the
world
,
 
to
be
the
purest
,
the
truest
,
and
the
noblest
.
<EOS>
It
has
been
said
of
Sir
Florian
that
he
did
not
believe
in
virtue
.
<EOS>
He
freely
expressed
disbelief
in
the
virtue
of
women
around
him
,
 
in
the
virtue
of
women
of
all
ranks
.
<EOS>
But
he
believed
in
his
mother
and
sisters
as
though
they
were
heaven
-
born
;
and
he
was
one
who
could
believe
in
his
wife
as
though
she
were
the
queen
of
heaven
.
<EOS>
He
did
believe
in
Lizzie
Greystock
,
thinking
that
intellect
,
purity
,
truth
,
and
beauty
,
each
perfect
in
its
degree
,
were
combined
in
her
.
<EOS>
The
intellect
and
beauty
were
there
;
 
but
,
for
the
purity
and
truth
 
;
how
could
it
have
been
that
such
a
one
as
Sir
Florian
Eustace
should
have
been
so
blind
!
  
<EOS>
Sir
Florian
was
not
,
indeed
,
a
clever
man
;
but
he
believed
himself
to
be
a
fool
.
<EOS>
And
believing
himself
to
be
a
fool
,
he
desired
,
nay
,
painfully
longed
,
for
some
of
those
results
of
cleverness
which
might
,
he
thought
,
come
to
him
,
from
contact
with
a
clever
woman
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
read
poetry
well
,
and
she
read
verses
to
him
,
 
sitting
very
near
to
him
,
almost
in
the
dark
,
with
a
shaded
lamp
throwing
its
light
on
her
book
.
<EOS>
He
was
astonished
to
find
how
sweet
a
thing
was
poetry
.
<EOS>
By
himself
he
could
never
read
a
line
,
but
as
it
came
from
her
lips
it
seemed
to
charm
him
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
new
pleasure
,
and
one
which
,
though
he
had
ridiculed
it
,
he
had
so
often
coveted
!
<EOS>
And
then
she
told
him
of
such
wondrous
thoughts
,
 
such
wondrous
joys
in
the
world
which
would
come
from
thinking
!
<EOS>
He
was
proud
,
I
have
said
,
and
haughty
;
but
he
was
essentially
modest
and
humble
in
his
self
-
estimation
.
<EOS>
How
divine
was
this
creature
,
whose
voice
to
him
was
as
that
of
a
goddess
!
  
<EOS>
Then
he
spoke
out
to
her
,
with
his
face
a
little
turned
from
her
.
<EOS>
Would
she
be
his
wife
?
<EOS>
But
,
before
she
answered
him
,
let
her
listen
to
him
.
<EOS>
They
had
told
him
that
an
early
death
must
probably
be
his
fate
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
himself
feel
that
it
must
be
so
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
he
was
ill
,
 
very
ill
;
but
often
he
was
well
.
<EOS>
If
she
would
run
the
risk
with
him
he
would
endeavour
to
make
her
such
recompense
as
might
come
from
his
wealth
.
<EOS>
The
speech
he
made
was
somewhat
long
,
and
as
he
made
it
he
hardly
looked
into
her
face
.
  
<EOS>
But
it
was
necessary
to
him
that
he
should
be
made
to
know
by
some
signal
from
her
how
it
was
going
with
her
feelings
.
<EOS>
As
he
spoke
of
his
danger
,
there
came
a
gurgling
little
trill
of
wailing
from
her
throat
,
a
soft
,
almost
musical
sound
of
woe
,
which
seemed
to
add
an
unaccustomed
eloquence
to
his
words
.
<EOS>
When
he
spoke
of
his
own
hope
the
sound
was
somewhat
changed
,
but
it
was
still
continued
.
<EOS>
When
he
alluded
to
the
disposition
of
his
fortune
,
she
was
at
his
feet
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Not
that
,
"
she
said
,
"
not
that
!
"
<EOS>
He
lifted
her
,
and
with
his
arm
round
her
waist
he
tried
to
tell
her
what
it
would
be
his
duty
to
do
for
her
.
<EOS>
She
escaped
from
his
arm
and
would
not
listen
to
him
.
<EOS>
But
,
 
but
 
!
<EOS>
When
he
began
to
talk
of
love
again
,
she
stood
with
her
forehead
bowed
against
his
bosom
.
<EOS>
Of
course
the
engagement
was
then
a
thing
accomplished
.
  
<EOS>
But
still
the
cup
might
slip
from
her
lips
.
<EOS>
Her
father
was
now
dead
but
ten
months
,
and
what
answer
could
she
make
when
the
common
pressing
petition
for
an
early
marriage
was
poured
into
her
ear
?
<EOS>
This
was
in
July
,
and
it
would
never
do
that
he
should
be
left
,
unmarried
,
to
the
rigour
of
another
winter
.
<EOS>
She
looked
into
his
face
and
knew
that
she
had
cause
for
fear
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
heavens
!
<EOS>
if
all
these
golden
hopes
should
fall
to
the
ground
,
and
she
should
come
to
be
known
only
as
the
girl
who
had
been
engaged
to
the
late
Sir
Florian
!
<EOS>
But
he
himself
pressed
the
marriage
on
the
same
ground
.
<EOS>
"
They
tell
me
,
"
he
said
,
"
that
I
had
better
get
a
little
south
by
the
beginning
of
October
.
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
go
alone
.
<EOS>
You
know
what
I
mean
;
 
eh
,
Lizzie
?
<EOS>
"
Of
course
she
married
him
in
September
.
  
<EOS>
They
spent
a
honeymoon
of
six
weeks
at
a
place
he
had
in
Scotland
,
and
the
first
blow
came
upon
him
as
they
passed
through
London
,
back
from
Scotland
,
on
their
way
to
Italy
.
<EOS>
Messrs.
Harter
and
Benjamin
sent
in
their
little
bill
,
which
amounted
to
something
over
£
400
,
and
other
little
bills
were
sent
in
.
<EOS>
Sir
Florian
was
a
man
by
whom
such
bills
would
certainly
be
paid
,
but
by
whom
they
would
not
be
paid
without
his
understanding
much
and
conceiving
more
as
to
their
cause
and
nature
.
<EOS>
How
much
he
really
did
understand
she
was
never
quite
aware
;
 
but
she
did
know
that
he
detected
her
in
a
positive
falsehood
.
<EOS>
She
might
certainly
have
managed
the
matter
better
than
she
did
;
and
had
she
admitted
everything
there
might
probably
have
been
but
few
words
about
it
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
,
however
,
understand
the
nature
of
the
note
she
had
signed
,
and
thought
that
simply
new
bills
would
be
presented
by
the
jewellers
to
her
husband
.
<EOS>
She
gave
a
false
account
of
the
transaction
,
and
the
lie
was
detected
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
that
she
cared
very
much
.
<EOS>
As
she
was
utterly
devoid
of
true
tenderness
,
so
also
was
she
devoid
of
conscience
.
<EOS>
They
went
abroad
,
however
;
and
by
the
time
the
winter
was
half
over
in
Naples
<EOS>
,
he
knew
what
his
wife
was
;
 
and
before
the
end
of
the
spring
he
was
dead
.
  
<EOS>
She
had
so
far
played
her
game
well
,
and
had
won
her
stakes
.
<EOS>
What
regrets
,
what
remorse
she
suffered
when
she
knew
that
he
was
going
from
her
,
 
and
then
knew
that
he
was
gone
,
who
can
say
?
<EOS>
As
man
is
never
strong
enough
to
take
unmixed
delight
in
good
,
so
may
we
presume
also
that
he
can
not
be
quite
so
weak
as
to
find
perfect
satisfaction
in
evil
.
<EOS>
There
must
have
been
qualms
as
she
looked
at
his
dying
face
,
soured
with
the
disappointment
she
had
brought
upon
him
,
and
listened
to
the
harsh
querulous
voice
that
was
no
longer
eager
in
the
expressions
of
love
.
<EOS>
There
must
have
been
some
pang
when
she
reflected
that
the
cruel
wrong
which
she
had
inflicted
on
him
had
probably
hurried
him
to
his
grave
.
<EOS>
As
a
widow
,
in
the
first
solemnity
of
her
widowhood
,
she
was
wretched
and
would
see
no
one
.
<EOS>
Then
she
returned
to
England
and
shut
herself
up
in
a
small
house
at
Brighton
.
<EOS>
Lady
Linlithgow
offered
to
go
to
her
,
but
she
begged
that
she
might
be
left
to
herself
.
<EOS>
For
a
few
short
months
the
awe
arising
from
the
rapidity
with
which
it
had
all
occurred
did
afflict
her
.
<EOS>
Twelve
months
since
she
had
hardly
known
the
man
who
was
to
be
her
husband
.
<EOS>
Now
she
was
a
widow
,
 
a
widow
very
richly
endowed
,
 
and
she
bore
beneath
her
bosom
<EOS>
the
fruit
of
her
husband
's
love
.
  
<EOS>
But
,
even
in
these
early
days
,
friends
and
enemies
did
not
hesitate
to
say
that
Lizzie
Greystock
had
done
very
well
with
herself
;
for
it
was
known
by
all
concerned
that
in
the
settlements
made
she
had
been
treated
with
unwonted
generosity
.
   
<EOS>
Lady
Eustace
 
<EOS>
There
were
circumstances
in
her
position
which
made
it
impossible
that
Lizzie
Greystock
,
 
or
Lady
Eustace
,
as
we
must
now
call
her
,
 
should
be
left
altogether
to
herself
in
the
modest
widow
's
retreat
which
she
had
found
at
Brighton
.
<EOS>
It
was
then
April
,
and
it
was
known
that
if
all
things
went
well
with
her
,
she
would
be
a
mother
before
the
summer
was
over
.
<EOS>
On
what
the
Fates
might
ordain
in
this
matter
immense
interests
were
dependent
.
<EOS>
If
a
son
should
be
born
he
would
inherit
everything
,
subject
,
of
course
,
to
his
mother
's
settlement
.
<EOS>
If
a
daughter
,
to
her
would
belong
the
great
personal
wealth
which
Sir
Florian
had
owned
at
the
time
of
his
death
.
<EOS>
Should
there
be
no
son
,
John
Eustace
,
the
brother
,
would
inherit
the
estates
in
Yorkshire
which
had
been
the
backbone
of
the
Eustace
wealth
.
<EOS>
Should
no
child
be
born
,
John
Eustace
would
inherit
everything
that
had
not
been
settled
upon
or
left
to
the
widow
.
<EOS>
Sir
Florian
had
made
a
settlement
immediately
before
his
marriage
,
and
a
will
immediately
afterwards
.
<EOS>
Of
what
he
had
done
then
,
nothing
had
been
altered
in
those
sad
Italian
days
.
<EOS>
The
settlement
had
been
very
generous
.
<EOS>
The
whole
property
in
Scotland
was
to
belong
to
Lizzie
for
her
life
,
 
and
after
her
death
was
to
go
to
a
second
son
,
if
such
second
son
there
should
be
.
<EOS>
By
the
will
money
was
left
to
her
,
more
than
would
be
needed
for
any
possible
temporary
emergency
.
<EOS>
When
she
knew
how
it
was
all
arranged
,
 
as
far
as
she
did
know
it
,
 
<EOS>
she
was
aware
that
she
was
a
rich
woman
.
<EOS>
For
so
clever
a
woman
she
was
infinitely
ignorant
as
to
the
possession
and
value
of
money
and
land
and
income
,
 
though
,
perhaps
,
not
more
ignorant
than
are
most
young
girls
under
twenty
-
one
.
<EOS>
As
for
the
Scotch
property
,
 
she
thought
that
it
was
her
own
,
for
ever
,
because
there
could
not
now
be
a
second
son
,
 
and
yet
was
not
quite
sure
whether
it
would
be
her
own
at
all
if
she
had
no
son
.
<EOS>
Concerning
that
sum
of
money
left
to
her
,
she
did
not
know
whether
it
was
to
come
out
of
the
Scotch
property
or
be
given
to
her
separately
,
 
and
whether
it
was
to
come
annually
or
to
come
only
once
.
<EOS>
She
had
received
,
while
still
in
Naples
,
a
letter
from
the
family
lawyer
,
giving
her
such
details
of
the
will
as
it
was
necessary
that
she
should
know
,
and
now
she
longed
to
ask
questions
,
to
have
her
belongings
made
plain
to
her
,
and
to
realise
her
wealth
.
<EOS>
She
had
brilliant
prospects
;
and
yet
,
through
it
all
,
there
was
a
sense
of
loneliness
that
nearly
killed
her
.
<EOS>
Would
it
not
have
been
much
better
if
her
husband
had
lived
,
and
still
worshipped
her
,
and
still
allowed
her
to
read
poetry
to
him
?
<EOS>
But
she
had
read
no
poetry
to
him
after
that
affair
of
Messrs.
Harter
and
Benjamin
.
  
<EOS>
The
reader
has
,
or
will
have
,
but
little
to
do
with
these
days
,
and
may
be
hurried
on
through
the
twelve
,
or
even
twenty
-
four
months
which
followed
the
death
of
poor
Sir
Florian
.
<EOS>
The
question
of
the
heirship
,
however
,
was
very
grave
,
and
early
in
the
month
of
May
Lady
Eustace
was
visited
by
her
husband
's
uncle
,
Bishop
Eustace
,
of
Bobsborough
.
<EOS>
The
bishop
had
been
the
younger
brother
of
Sir
Florian
's
father
,
 
was
at
this
time
a
man
about
fifty
,
very
active
and
very
popular
,
 
and
was
one
who
stood
high
in
the
world
,
even
among
bishops
.
<EOS>
He
suggested
to
his
niece
-
in
-
law
that
it
was
very
expedient
that
,
during
her
coming
hour
of
trial
,
she
should
not
absent
herself
from
her
husband
's
family
,
and
at
last
persuaded
her
to
take
up
her
residence
at
the
palace
at
Bobsborough
till
such
time
as
the
event
should
be
over
.
<EOS>
Lady
Eustace
was
taken
to
the
palace
,
and
in
due
time
a
son
was
born
.
<EOS>
John
,
who
was
now
the
uncle
of
the
heir
,
came
down
,
and
,
with
the
frankest
good
humour
,
declared
that
he
would
devote
himself
to
the
little
head
of
the
family
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
left
as
guardian
,
and
the
management
of
the
great
family
estates
was
to
be
in
his
hands
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
had
read
no
poetry
to
him
,
and
he
had
never
liked
her
,
and
the
bishop
did
not
like
her
,
and
the
ladies
of
the
bishop
's
family
disliked
her
very
much
,
and
it
was
thought
by
them
that
the
dean
's
people
,
 
the
Dean
of
Bobsborough
was
Lizzie
's
uncle
,
 
were
not
very
fond
of
Lizzie
since
Lizzie
had
so
raised
herself
in
the
world
as
to
want
no
assistance
from
them
.
<EOS>
But
still
they
were
bound
to
do
their
duty
by
her
as
the
widow
of
the
late
and
the
mother
of
the
present
baronet
.
<EOS>
And
they
did
not
find
much
cause
of
complaining
as
to
Lizzie
's
conduct
in
these
days
.
<EOS>
In
that
matter
of
the
great
family
diamond
necklace
,
 
which
certainly
should
not
have
been
taken
to
Naples
at
all
,
and
as
to
which
the
jeweller
had
told
the
lawyer
and
the
lawyer
had
told
John
Eustace
that
it
certainly
should
not
now
be
detained
among
the
widow
's
own
private
property
,
 
the
bishop
strongly
recommended
that
nothing
should
be
said
at
present
.
<EOS>
The
mistake
,
if
there
was
a
mistake
,
could
be
remedied
at
any
time
.
<EOS>
And
nothing
in
those
very
early
days
was
said
about
the
great
Eustace
necklace
,
which
afterwards
became
so
famous
.
  
<EOS>
Why
Lizzie
should
have
been
so
generally
disliked
by
the
Eustaces
,
it
might
be
hard
to
explain
.
<EOS>
While
she
remained
at
the
palace
she
was
very
discreet
,
 
and
perhaps
demure
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
said
they
disliked
her
expressed
determination
to
cut
her
aunt
,
Lady
Linlithgow
;
 
for
they
knew
that
Lady
Linlithgow
had
been
,
at
any
rate
,
a
friend
to
Lizzie
Greystock
.
<EOS>
There
are
people
who
can
be
wise
within
a
certain
margin
,
but
beyond
that
commit
great
imprudences
.
<EOS>
Lady
Eustace
submitted
herself
to
the
palace
people
for
that
period
of
her
prostration
,
but
she
could
not
hold
her
tongue
as
to
her
future
intentions
.
<EOS>
She
would
,
too
,
now
and
then
ask
of
Mrs.
Eustace
,
and
even
of
her
daughter
,
an
eager
,
anxious
question
about
her
own
property
.
<EOS>
"
She
is
dying
to
handle
her
money
,
"
said
Mrs.
Eustace
to
the
bishop
.
<EOS>
"
She
is
only
like
the
rest
of
the
world
in
that
,
"
said
the
bishop
.
<EOS>
"
If
she
would
be
really
open
,
I
would
n't
mind
it
,
"
said
Mrs.
Eustace
.
<EOS>
None
of
them
liked
her
,
 
and
she
did
not
like
them
.
  
<EOS>
She
remained
at
the
palace
for
six
months
,
and
at
the
end
of
that
time
she
went
to
her
own
place
in
Scotland
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Eustace
had
strongly
advised
her
to
ask
her
aunt
,
Lady
Linlithgow
,
to
accompany
her
,
but
in
refusing
to
do
this
,
Lizzie
was
quite
firm
.
<EOS>
She
had
endured
Lady
Linlithgow
for
that
year
between
her
father
's
death
and
her
marriage
;
she
was
now
beginning
to
dare
to
hope
for
the
enjoyment
of
the
good
things
which
she
had
won
,
and
the
presence
of
the
dowager
-
countess
,
 
"
the
vulturess
,
"
 
was
certainly
not
one
of
these
good
things
.
<EOS>
In
what
her
enjoyment
was
to
consist
,
she
had
not
as
yet
quite
formed
a
definite
conclusion
.
<EOS>
She
liked
jewels
.
<EOS>
She
liked
admiration
.
<EOS>
She
liked
the
power
of
being
arrogant
to
those
around
her
.
<EOS>
And
she
liked
good
things
to
eat
.
<EOS>
But
there
were
other
matters
that
were
also
dear
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
did
like
music
,
 
though
it
may
be
doubted
whether
she
would
ever
play
it
or
even
listen
to
it
alone
.
<EOS>
She
did
like
reading
,
and
especially
the
reading
of
poetry
,
 
though
even
in
this
she
was
false
and
pretentious
,
skipping
,
pretending
to
have
read
,
lying
about
books
,
and
making
up
her
market
of
literature
for
outside
admiration
at
the
easiest
possible
cost
of
trouble
.
<EOS>
And
she
had
some
dream
of
being
in
love
,
and
would
take
delight
even
in
building
castles
in
the
air
,
which
she
would
people
with
friends
and
lovers
whom
she
would
make
happy
with
the
most
open
-
hearted
benevolence
.
<EOS>
She
had
theoretical
ideas
of
life
which
were
not
bad
,
 
but
in
practice
,
she
had
gained
her
objects
,
and
she
was
in
a
hurry
to
have
liberty
to
enjoy
them
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
considerable
anxiety
in
the
palace
in
reference
to
the
future
mode
of
life
of
Lady
Eustace
.
<EOS>
Had
it
not
been
for
that
baby
-
heir
,
of
course
there
would
have
been
no
cause
for
interference
;
but
the
rights
of
that
baby
were
so
serious
and
important
that
it
was
almost
impossible
not
to
interfere
.
<EOS>
The
mother
,
however
,
gave
some
little
signs
that
she
did
not
intend
to
submit
to
much
interference
,
and
there
was
no
real
reason
why
she
should
not
be
as
free
as
air
.
<EOS>
But
did
she
really
intend
to
go
down
to
Portray
Castle
all
alone
;
 
that
is
,
with
her
baby
and
nurses
?
<EOS>
This
was
ended
by
an
arrangement
,
in
accordance
with
which
she
was
accompanied
by
her
eldest
cousin
,
Ellinor
Greystock
,
a
lady
who
was
just
ten
years
her
senior
.
<EOS>
There
could
hardly
be
a
better
woman
than
Ellinor
Greystock
,
 
or
a
more
good
-
humoured
,
kindly
being
.
<EOS>
After
many
debates
in
the
deanery
and
in
the
palace
,
 
for
there
was
much
friendship
between
the
two
ecclesiastical
establishments
,
 
the
offer
was
made
and
the
advice
given
.
<EOS>
Ellinor
had
accepted
the
martyrdom
on
the
understanding
that
if
the
advice
were
accepted
she
was
to
remain
at
Portray
Castle
for
three
months
.
<EOS>
After
a
long
discussion
between
Lady
Eustace
and
the
bishop
's
wife
<EOS>
the
offer
was
accepted
,
and
the
two
ladies
went
to
Scotland
together
.
  
<EOS>
During
those
three
months
the
widow
still
bided
her
time
.
<EOS>
Of
her
future
ideas
of
life
she
said
not
a
word
to
her
companion
.
<EOS>
Of
her
infant
she
said
very
little
.
<EOS>
She
would
talk
of
books
,
 
choosing
such
books
as
her
cousin
did
not
read
;
and
she
would
interlard
her
conversation
with
much
Italian
,
because
her
cousin
did
not
know
the
language
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
carriage
kept
by
the
widow
,
and
they
had
themselves
driven
out
together
.
<EOS>
Of
real
companionship
there
was
none
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
was
biding
her
time
,
and
at
the
end
of
the
three
months
Miss
Greystock
thankfully
,
and
,
indeed
,
of
necessity
,
returned
to
Bobsborough
.
<EOS>
"
I
've
done
no
good
,
"
she
said
to
her
mother
,
"
and
have
been
very
uncomfortable
.
"
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
"
said
her
mother
,
"
we
have
disposed
of
three
months
out
of
a
two
years
"
period
of
danger
.
<EOS>
In
two
years
from
Sir
Florian
's
death
she
will
be
married
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
When
this
was
said
Lizzie
had
been
a
widow
nearly
a
year
,
and
had
bided
her
time
upon
the
whole
discreetly
.
<EOS>
Some
foolish
letters
she
had
written
,
 
chiefly
to
the
lawyer
about
her
money
and
property
;
and
some
foolish
things
she
had
said
,
 
as
when
she
told
Ellinor
Greystock
that
the
Portray
property
was
her
own
for
ever
,
to
do
what
she
liked
with
it
.
<EOS>
The
sum
of
money
left
to
her
by
her
husband
had
by
that
time
been
paid
into
her
own
hands
,
and
she
had
opened
a
banker
's
account
.
<EOS>
The
revenues
from
the
Scotch
estate
,
 
some
£
4,000
a
year
,
 
were
clearly
her
own
for
life
.
<EOS>
The
family
diamond
-
necklace
was
still
in
her
possession
,
and
no
answer
had
been
given
by
her
to
a
postscript
to
a
lawyer
's
letter
in
which
a
little
advice
had
been
given
respecting
it
.
<EOS>
At
the
end
of
another
year
,
when
she
had
just
reached
the
age
of
twenty
-
two
,
and
had
completed
her
second
year
of
widowhood
,
she
was
still
Lady
Eustace
,
thus
contradicting
the
prophecy
made
by
the
dean
's
wife
.
<EOS>
It
was
then
spring
,
and
she
had
a
house
of
her
own
in
London
.
<EOS>
She
had
broken
openly
with
Lady
Linlithgow
.
<EOS>
She
had
opposed
,
though
not
absolutely
refused
,
all
overtures
of
brotherly
care
from
John
Eustace
.
<EOS>
She
had
declined
a
further
invitation
,
both
for
herself
and
for
her
child
,
to
the
palace
.
<EOS>
And
she
had
positively
asserted
her
intention
of
keeping
the
diamonds
.
<EOS>
Her
late
husband
,
she
said
,
had
given
the
diamonds
to
her
.
<EOS>
As
they
were
supposed
to
be
worth
£
10,000
,
and
were
really
family
diamonds
,
the
matter
was
felt
by
all
concerned
to
be
one
of
much
importance
.
<EOS>
And
she
was
oppressed
by
a
heavy
load
of
ignorance
,
which
became
serious
from
the
isolation
of
her
position
.
<EOS>
She
had
learned
to
draw
cheques
,
but
she
had
no
other
correct
notion
as
to
business
.
<EOS>
She
knew
nothing
as
to
spending
money
,
saving
it
,
or
investing
it
.
<EOS>
Though
she
was
clever
,
sharp
,
and
greedy
,
she
had
no
idea
what
her
money
would
do
,
and
what
it
would
not
;
and
there
was
no
one
whom
she
would
trust
to
tell
her
.
<EOS>
She
had
a
young
cousin
,
a
barrister
,
 
a
son
of
the
dean
's
,
whom
she
perhaps
liked
better
than
any
other
of
her
relations
,
 
but
she
declined
advice
even
from
her
friend
the
barrister
.
<EOS>
She
would
have
no
dealings
on
her
own
behalf
with
the
old
family
solicitor
of
the
Eustaces
,
 
the
gentleman
who
had
now
applied
very
formally
for
the
restitution
of
the
diamonds
;
but
had
appointed
other
solicitors
to
act
for
her
.
<EOS>
Messrs.
Mowbray
and
Mopus
were
of
opinion
that
as
the
diamonds
had
been
given
into
her
hands
by
her
husband
without
any
terms
as
to
their
surrender
,
no
one
could
claim
them
.
<EOS>
Of
the
manner
in
which
the
diamonds
had
been
placed
in
her
hands
,
no
one
knew
more
than
she
chose
to
tell
.
  
<EOS>
But
when
she
started
with
her
house
in
town
,
 
a
modest
little
house
in
Mount
Street
,
near
the
park
,
 
just
two
years
after
her
husband
's
death
,
she
had
a
large
circle
of
acquaintances
.
<EOS>
The
Eustace
people
,
and
the
Greystock
people
,
and
even
the
Linlithgow
people
,
did
not
entirely
turn
their
backs
on
her
.
<EOS>
The
countess
,
indeed
,
was
very
venomous
,
as
she
well
might
be
;
but
then
the
countess
was
known
for
her
venom
.
<EOS>
The
dean
and
his
family
were
still
anxious
that
she
should
be
encouraged
to
discreet
living
,
and
,
though
they
feared
many
things
,
thought
that
they
had
no
ground
for
open
complaint
.
<EOS>
The
Eustace
people
were
forbearing
,
and
hoped
the
best
.
<EOS>
"
D
 
---
the
necklace
!
"
<EOS>
John
Eustace
had
said
,
and
the
bishop
unfortunately
had
heard
him
say
it
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
John
,
"
said
the
prelate
,
"
whatever
is
to
become
of
the
bauble
,
you
might
express
your
opinion
in
more
sensible
language
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
lordship
's
pardon
,
"
said
John
,
"
I
only
mean
to
say
that
I
think
we
should
n't
trouble
ourselves
about
a
few
stones
.
<EOS>
"
But
the
family
lawyer
,
Mr.
Camperdown
,
would
by
no
means
take
this
view
of
the
matter
.
<EOS>
It
was
,
however
,
generally
thought
that
the
young
widow
opened
her
campaign
more
prudently
than
had
been
expected
.
  
<EOS>
And
now
as
so
much
has
been
said
of
the
character
and
fortune
and
special
circumstances
of
Lizzie
Greystock
,
who
became
Lady
Eustace
as
a
bride
,
and
Lady
Eustace
as
a
widow
and
a
mother
,
all
within
the
space
of
twelve
months
,
it
may
be
as
well
to
give
some
description
of
her
person
and
habits
,
such
as
they
were
at
the
period
in
which
our
story
is
supposed
to
have
its
commencement
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
understood
in
the
first
place
that
she
was
very
lovely
;
 
much
more
so
,
indeed
,
now
than
when
she
had
fascinated
Sir
Florian
.
<EOS>
She
was
small
,
but
taller
than
she
looked
to
be
,
 
for
her
form
was
perfectly
symmetrical
.
<EOS>
Her
feet
and
hands
might
have
been
taken
as
models
by
a
sculptor
.
<EOS>
Her
figure
was
lithe
,
and
soft
,
and
slim
,
and
slender
.
<EOS>
If
it
had
a
fault
it
was
this
,
 
that
it
had
in
it
too
much
of
movement
.
<EOS>
There
were
some
who
said
that
she
was
almost
snake
-
like
in
her
rapid
bendings
and
the
almost
too
easy
gestures
of
her
body
;
for
she
was
much
given
to
action
,
and
to
the
expression
of
her
thought
by
the
motion
of
her
limbs
.
<EOS>
She
might
certainly
have
made
her
way
as
an
actress
,
had
fortune
called
upon
her
to
earn
her
bread
in
that
fashion
.
<EOS>
And
her
voice
would
have
suited
the
stage
.
<EOS>
It
was
powerful
when
she
called
upon
it
for
power
;
but
,
at
the
same
time
,
flexible
and
capable
of
much
pretence
at
feeling
.
<EOS>
She
could
bring
it
to
a
whisper
that
would
almost
melt
your
heart
with
tenderness
,
 
as
she
had
melted
Sir
Florian
's
,
when
she
sat
near
to
him
reading
poetry
;
and
then
she
could
raise
it
to
a
pitch
of
indignant
wrath
befitting
a
Lady
Macbeth
when
her
husband
ventured
to
rebuke
her
.
<EOS>
And
her
ear
was
quite
correct
in
modulating
these
tones
.
<EOS>
She
knew
,
 
and
it
must
have
been
by
instinct
,
for
her
culture
in
such
matters
<EOS>
was
small
,
 
how
to
use
her
voice
so
that
neither
its
tenderness
nor
its
wrath
should
be
misapplied
.
<EOS>
There
were
pieces
in
verse
that
she
could
read
,
 
things
not
wondrously
good
in
themselves
,
 
so
that
she
would
ravish
you
;
and
she
would
so
look
at
you
as
she
did
it
that
you
would
hardly
dare
either
to
avert
your
eyes
or
to
return
her
gaze
.
<EOS>
Sir
Florian
had
not
known
whether
to
do
the
one
thing
or
the
other
,
and
had
therefore
seized
her
in
his
arms
.
<EOS>
Her
face
was
oval
,
 
somewhat
longer
than
an
oval
,
 
with
little
in
it
,
perhaps
nothing
in
it
,
of
that
brilliancy
of
colour
which
we
call
complexion
.
<EOS>
And
yet
the
shades
of
her
countenance
were
ever
changing
between
the
softest
and
most
transparent
white
,
and
the
richest
,
mellowest
shades
of
brown
.
<EOS>
It
was
only
when
she
simulated
anger
,
 
she
was
almost
incapable
of
real
anger
,
 
that
she
would
succeed
in
calling
the
thinnest
streak
of
pink
from
her
heart
,
to
show
that
there
was
blood
running
in
her
veins
.
<EOS>
Her
hair
,
which
was
nearly
black
,
 
but
in
truth
with
more
of
softness
and
of
lustre
than
ever
belong
to
hair
that
is
really
black
,
 
<EOS>
she
wore
bound
tight
round
<EOS>
her
perfect
forehead
,
with
one
long
love
-
lock
hanging
over
her
shoulder
.
<EOS>
The
form
of
her
head
was
so
good
that
she
could
dare
to
carry
it
without
a
chignon
,
or
any
adventitious
adjuncts
from
an
artiste
's
shop
.
<EOS>
Very
bitter
was
she
in
consequence
when
speaking
of
the
head
-
gear
of
other
women
.
<EOS>
Her
chin
was
perfect
in
its
round
,
not
over
long
,
 
as
is
the
case
with
so
many
such
faces
,
utterly
spoiling
the
symmetry
of
the
countenance
.
<EOS>
But
it
lacked
a
dimple
,
and
therefore
lacked
feminine
tenderness
.
<EOS>
Her
mouth
was
perhaps
faulty
in
being
too
small
,
or
,
at
least
,
her
lips
were
too
thin
.
<EOS>
There
was
wanting
from
the
mouth
that
expression
of
eager
-
speaking
truthfulness
which
full
lips
will
often

Her
teeth
were
without
flaw
or
blemish
,
even
,
small
,
white
,
and
delicate
;
but
perhaps
they
were
shown
too
often
.
<EOS>
Her
nose
was
small
,
but
struck
many
as
the
prettiest
feature
of
her
face
,
so
exquisite
was
the
moulding
of
it
,
and
so
eloquent
and
so
graceful
the
slight
inflations
of
the
transparent
nostrils
.
<EOS>
Her
eyes
,
in
which
she
herself
thought
that
the
lustre
of
her
beauty
lay
,
were
blue
and
clear
,
bright
as
cerulean
waters
.
<EOS>
They
were
long
large
eyes
,
 
but
very
dangerous
.
<EOS>
To
those
who
knew
how
to
read
a
face
,
there
was
danger
plainly
written
in
them
.
<EOS>
Poor
Sir
Florian
had
not
known
.
<EOS>
But
,
in
truth
,
the
charm
of
her
face
did
not
lie
in
her
eyes
.
<EOS>
This
was
felt
by
many
even
who
could
not
read
the
book
fluently
.
<EOS>
They
were
too
expressive
,
too
loud
in
their
demands
for
attention
,
and
they
lacked
tenderness
.
<EOS>
How
few
there
are
among
women
,
few
perhaps
also
among
men
,
who
know
that
the
sweetest
,
softest
,
tenderest
,
truest
eyes
which
a
woman
can
carry
in
her
head
are
green
in
colour
!
<EOS>
Lizzie
's
eyes
were
not
tender
,
 
neither
were
they
true
.
<EOS>
But
they
were
surmounted
by
the
most
wonderfully
pencilled
eyebrows
that
ever
nature
unassisted
planted
on
a
woman
's
face
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
said
that
she
was
clever
.
<EOS>
We
must
add
that
she
had
in
truth
studied
much
.
<EOS>
She
spoke
French
,
understood
Italian
,
and
read
German
.
<EOS>
She
played
well
on
the
harp
,
and
moderately
well
on
the
piano
.
<EOS>
She
sang
,
at
least
in
good
taste
and
in
tune
.
<EOS>
Of
things
to
be
learned
by
reading
she
knew
much
,
having
really
taken
diligent
trouble
with
herself
.
<EOS>
She
had
learned
much
poetry
by
heart
,
and
could
apply
it
.
<EOS>
She
forgot
nothing
,
listened
to
everything
,
understood
quickly
,
and
was
desirous
to
show
not
only
as
a
beauty
but
as
a
wit
.
<EOS>
There
were
men
at
this
time
who
declared
that
she
was
simply
the
cleverest
and
the
handsomest
woman
in
England
.
<EOS>
As
an
independent
young
woman
she
was
perhaps
one
of
the
richest
.

Although
the
first
two
chapters
of
this
new
history
have
been
devoted
to
the
fortunes
and
personal
attributes
of
Lady
Eustace
,
the
historian
begs
his
readers
not
to
believe
that
that
opulent
and
aristocratic
Becky
Sharp
is
to
assume
the
dignity
of
heroine
in
the
forthcoming
pages
.
<EOS>
That
there
shall
be
any
heroine
the
historian
will
not
take
upon
himself
to
assert
;
but
if
there
be
a
heroine
,
that
heroine
shall
not
be
Lady
Eustace
.
<EOS>
Poor
Lizzie
Greystock
!
 
<EOS>
as
men
double
her
own
age
,
and
who
had
known
her
as
a
forward
,
capricious
,
spoilt
child
in
her
father
's
lifetime
,
would
still
call
her
.
<EOS>
She
did
so
many
things
,
made
so
many
efforts
,
caused
so
much
suffering
to
others
,
and
suffered
so
much
herself
throughout
the
scenes
with
which
we
are
about
to
deal
,
that
the
story
can
hardly
be
told
without
giving
her
that
prominence
of
place
which
has
been
assigned
to
her
in
the
last
two
chapters
.
  
<EOS>
Nor
does
the
chronicler
dare
to
put
forward
Lucy
Morris
as
a
heroine
.
<EOS>
The
real
heroine
,
if
it
be
found
possible
to
arrange
her
drapery
for
her
becomingly
,
and
to
put
that
part
which
she
enacted
into
properly
heroic
words
,
shall
stalk
in
among
us
at
some
considerably
later
period
of
the
narrative
,
when
the
writer
shall
have
accustomed
himself
to
the
flow
of
words
,
and
have
worked
himself
up
to
a
state
of
mind
fit
for
the
reception
of
noble
acting
and
noble
speaking
.
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
,
let
it
be
understood
that
poor
little
Lucy
Morris
was
a
governess
in
the
house
of
old
Lady
Fawn
,
when
our
beautiful
young
widow
established
herself
in
Mount
Street
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Eustace
and
Lucy
Morris
had
known
each
other
for
many
years
,
 
had
indeed
been
children
together
,
 
there
having
been
some
old
family
friendship
between
the
Greystocks
and
the
Morrises
.
<EOS>
When
the
admiral
's
wife
was
living
,
Lucy
had
,
as
a
little
girl
of
eight
or
nine
,
been
her
guest
.
<EOS>
She
had
often
been
a
guest
at
the
deanery
.
<EOS>
When
Lady
Eustace
had
gone
down
to
the
bishop
's
palace
at
Bobsborough
,
in
order
that
an
heir
to
the
Eustaces
might
be
born
under
an
auspicious
roof
,
Lucy
Morris
was
with
the
Greystocks
.
<EOS>
Lucy
,
who
was
a
year
younger
than
Lizzie
,
had
at
that
time
been
an
orphan
for
the
last
four
years
.
<EOS>
She
too
had
been
left
penniless
,
but
no
such
brilliant
future
awaited
her
as
that
which
Lizzie
had
earned
for
herself
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
countess
-
aunt
to
take
her
into
her
London
house
.
<EOS>
The
dean
and
the
dean
's
wife
and
the
dean
's
daughters
had
been
her
best
friends
,
but
they
were
not
friends
on
whom
she
could
be
dependent
.
<EOS>
They
were
in
no
way
connected
with
her
by
blood
.
<EOS>
Therefore
,
at
the
age
of
eighteen
,
she
had
gone
out
to
be
a
child
's
governess
.
<EOS>
Then
old
Lady
Fawn
had
heard
of
her
virtues
,
 
Lady
Fawn
,
who
had
seven
unmarried
daughters
running
down
from
seven
-
and
-
twenty
to
thirteen
,
and
Lucy
Morris
had
been
hired
to
teach
English
,
French
,
German
,
and
something
of
music
to
the
two
youngest
Miss
Fawns
.
  
<EOS>
During
that
visit
at
the
deanery
,
when
the
heir
of
the
Eustaces
was
being
born
,
Lucy
was
undergoing
a
sort
of
probation
for
the
Fawn
establishment
.
<EOS>
The
proposed
engagement
with
Lady
Fawn
was
thought
to
be
a
great
thing
for
her
.
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
was
known
as
a
miracle
of
Virtue
,
Benevolence
,
and
Persistency
.
<EOS>
Every
good
quality
that
she
possessed
was
so
marked
as
to
be
worthy
of
being
expressed
with
a
capital
.
<EOS>
But
her
virtues
were
of
that
extraordinarily
high
character
that
there
was
no
weakness
in
them
,
 
no
getting
over
them
,
no
perverting
them
with
follies
or
even
exaggerations
.
<EOS>
When
she
heard
of
the
excellencies
of
Miss
Morris
from
the
dean
's
wife
,
and
then
,
after
minutest
investigation
,
learned
the
exact
qualities
of
the
young
lady
,
she
expressed
herself
willing
to
take
Lucy
into
her
house
on
special
conditions
.
<EOS>
She
must
be
able
to
teach
music
up
to
a
certain
point
.
<EOS>
"
Then
it
's
all
over
,
"
said
Lucy
to
the
dean
with
her
pretty
smile
,
 
that
smile
which
caused
all
the
old
and
middle
-
aged
men
to
fall
in
love
with
her
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
not
over
at
all
,
"
said
the
dean
.
<EOS>
"
You
've
got
four
months
.
<EOS>
Our
organist
is
about
as
good
a
teacher
as
there
is
in
England
.
<EOS>
You
are
clever
and
quick
,
and
he
shall
teach
you
.
"
<EOS>
So
Lucy
went
to
Bobsborough
,
and
was
afterwards
accepted
by
Lady
Fawn
.
  
<EOS>
While
she
was
at
the
deanery
there
sprung
up
a
renewed
friendship
between
her
and
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
It
was
,
indeed
,
chiefly
a
one
-
sided
friendship
;
for
Lucy
,
who
was
quick
and
unconsciously
capable
of
reading
that
book
to
which
we
alluded
in
a
previous
chapter
,
was
somewhat
afraid
of
the
rich
widow
.
<EOS>
And
when
Lizzie
talked
to
her
of
their
old
childish
days
,
and
quoted
poetry
,
and
spoke
of
things
romantic
,
 
as
she
was
much
given
to
do
,
 
Lucy
felt
that
the
metal
did
not
ring
true
.
<EOS>
And
then
Lizzie
had
an
ugly
habit
of
abusing
all
her
other
friends
behind
their
backs
.
<EOS>
Now
Lucy
did
not
like
to
hear
the
Greystocks
abused
,
and
would
say
so
.
<EOS>
"
That
's
all
very
well
,
<EOS>
you
little
minx
,
"
Lizzie
would
say
playfully
,
"
but
you
know
that
they
are
all
asses
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Lucy
by
no
means
thought
that
the
Greystocks
were
asses
,
and
was
very
strongly
of
opinion
that
one
of
them
was
as
far
removed
from
being
an
ass
as
any
human
being
she
had
ever
known
.
<EOS>
This
one
was
Frank
Greystock
,
the
barrister
.
<EOS>
Of
Frank
Greystock
some
special
 
<EOS>
but
,
let
it
be
hoped
,
very
short
 
description
must
be
given
by
-
and
-
by
.
<EOS>
For
the
present
it
will
be
sufficient
to
declare
that
,
during
that
short
Easter
holiday
which
he
spent
at
his
father
's
house
in
Bobsborough
,
he
found
Lucy
Morris
to
be
a
most
agreeable
companion
.
  
<EOS>
"
Remember
her
position
,
"
said
Mrs.
Dean
to
her
son
.
  
<EOS>
"
Her
position
!
<EOS>
Well
;
 
and
what
is
her
position
mother
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
what
I
mean
,
Frank
.
<EOS>
She
is
as
sweet
a
girl
as
ever
lived
,
and
a
perfect
lady
.
<EOS>
But
with
a
governess
,
unless
you
mean
to
marry
her
,
you
should
be
more
careful
than
with
another
girl
,
because
you
may
do
her
such
a
world
of
mischief
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
see
that
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
Lady
Fawn
knew
that
she
had
an
admirer
,
Lady
Fawn
would
not
let
her
come
into
her
house
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
Lady
Fawn
is
an
idiot
.
<EOS>
If
a
girl
be
admirable
,
of
course
she
will
be
admired
.
<EOS>
Who
can
hinder
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
what
I
mean
,
Frank
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
 
I
do
;
well
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
suppose
I
can
afford
to
marry
Lucy
Morris
.
<EOS>
At
any
rate
,
mother
,
I
will
never
say
a
word
to
raise
a
hope
in
her
,
 
if
it
would
be
a
hope
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
Of
course
it
would
be
a
hope
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
that
at
all
.
<EOS>
But
I
will
never
say
any
such
word
to
her
,
 
unless
I
make
up
my
mind
that
I
can
afford
to
marry
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Frank
,
it
would
be
impossible
!
"
said
Mrs.
Dean
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Dean
was
a
very
good
woman
,
but
she
had
aspirations
in
the
direction
of
filthy
lucre
on
behalf
of
her
children
,
or
at
least
on
behalf
of
this
special
child
,
and
she
did
think
it
would
be
very
nice
if
Frank
would
marry
an
heiress
.
<EOS>
This
,
however
,
was
a
long
time
ago
,
nearly
two
years
ago
;
and
many
grave
things
had
got
themselves
transacted
since
Lucy
's
visit
to
the
deanery
.
<EOS>
She
had
become
quite
an
old
and
an
accustomed
member
of
Lady
Fawn
's
family
.
<EOS>
The
youngest
Fawn
girl
was
not
yet
fifteen
,
and
it
was
understood
that
Lucy
was
to
remain
with
the
Fawns
for
some
quite
indefinite
time
to
come
.
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
's
eldest
daughter
,
Mrs.
Hittaway
,
had
a
family
of
her
own
,
having
been
married
ten
or
twelve
years
,
and
it
was
quite
probable
that
Lucy
might
be
transferred
.
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
fully
appreciated
her
treasure
,
and
was
,
and
ever
had
been
,
conscientiously
anxious
to
make
Lucy
's
life
happy
.
<EOS>
But
she
thought
that
a
governess
should
not
be
desirous
of
marrying
,
at
any
rate
till
a
somewhat
advanced
period
of
life
.
<EOS>
A
governess
,
if
she
were
given
to
falling
in
love
,
could
hardly
perform
her
duties
in
life
.
<EOS>
No
doubt
,
not
to
be
a
governess
,
but
a
young
lady
free
from
the
embarrassing
necessity
of
earning
bread
,
free
to
have
a
lover
and
a
husband
,
would
be
upon
the
whole
nicer
.
<EOS>
So
it
is
nicer
to
be
born
to
£
10,000
a
year
than
to
have
to
wish
for
£
500
.
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
could
talk
excellent
sense
on
this
subject
by
the
hour
,
and
always
admitted
that
much
was
due
to
a
governess
who
knew
her
place
and
did
her
duty
.
<EOS>
She
was
very
fond
of
Lucy
Morris
,
and
treated
her
dependent
with
affectionate
consideration
;
 
but
she
did
not
approve
of
visits
from
Mr.
Frank
Greystock
.
<EOS>
Lucy
,
blushing
up
to
the
eyes
,
had
once
declared
that
she
desired
to
have
no
personal
visitors
at
Lady
Fawn
's
house
;
but
that
,
as
regarded
her
own
friendships
,
the
matter
was
one
for
her
own
bosom
.
"
<EOS>
Dear
Miss
Morris
,
"
Lady
Fawn
had
said
,
"
we
understand
each
other
so
perfectly
,
and
you
are
so
good
,
that
I
am
quite
sure
everything
will
be
as
it
ought
to
be
.
"
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
lived
down
at
Richmond
all
the
year
through
,
in
a
large
old
-
fashioned
house
with
a
large
old
-
fashioned
garden
,
called
Fawn
Court
.
<EOS>
After
that
speech
of
hers
to
Lucy
,
Frank
Greystock
did
not
call
again
at
Fawn
Court
for
many
months
,
and
it
is
possible
that
her
ladyship
had
said
a
word
also
to
him
.
<EOS>
But
Lady
Eustace
,
with
her
pretty
little
pair
of
grey
ponies
,
would
sometimes
drive
down
to
Richmond
to
see
her
"
dear
little
old
friend
"
Lucy
,
and
her
visits
were
allowed
.
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
had
expressed
an
opinion
among
her
daughters
that
she
did
not
see
any
harm
in
Lady
Eustace
.
<EOS>
She
thought
that
she
rather
liked
Lady
Eustace
.
<EOS>
But
then
Lady
Fawn
hated
Lady
Linlithgow
as
only
two
old
women
can
hate
each
other
;
 
and
she
had
not
heard
the
story
of
the
diamond
necklace
.
  
<EOS>
Lucy
Morris
certainly
was
a
treasure
,
 
a
treasure
though
no
heroine
.
<EOS>
She
was
a
sweetly
social
,
genial
little
human
being
whose
presence
in
the
house
was
ever
felt
to
be
like
sunshine
.
<EOS>
She
was
never
forward
,
but
never
bashful
.
<EOS>
She
was
always
open
to
familiar
intercourse
without
ever
putting
herself
forward
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
man
or
woman
with
whom
she
would
not
so
talk
as
to
make
the
man
or
woman
feel
that
the
conversation
was
remarkably
pleasant
,
 
and
she
could
do
the
same
with
any
child
.
<EOS>
She
was
an
active
,
mindful
,
bright
,
energetic
little
thing
to
whom
no
work
ever
came
amiss
.
<EOS>
She
had
catalogued
the
library
,
 
which
had
been
collected
by
the
late
Lord
Fawn
with
peculiar
reference
to
the
Christian
theology
of
the
third
and
fourth
centuries
.
<EOS>
She
had
planned
the
new
flower
-
garden
,
 
though
Lady
Fawn
thought
that
she
had
done
that
herself
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
invaluable
during
Clara
Fawn
's
long
illness
.
<EOS>
She
knew
every
rule
at
croquet
,
and
could
play
piquet
.
<EOS>
When
the
girls
got
up
charades
they
had
to
acknowledge
that
everything
depended
on
Miss
Morris
.
<EOS>
They
were
good
-
natured
,
plain
,
unattractive
girls
,
who
spoke
of
her
to
her
face
as
one
who
could
easily
do
anything
to
which
she
might
put
her
hand
.
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
did
really
love
her
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
,
the
eldest
son
,
a
young
man
of
about
thirty
-
five
,
a
Peer
of
Parliament
and
an
Under
-
Secretary
of
State
,
 
very
prudent
and
very
diligent
,
 
of
whom
his
mother
and
sisters
stood
in
great
awe
,
consulted
her
frequently
and
made
no
secret
of
his
friendship
.
<EOS>
The
mother
knew
her
awful
son
well
,
and
was
afraid
of
nothing
wrong
in
that
direction
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
had
suffered
a
disappointment
in
love
,
but
he
had
consoled
himself
with
blue
-
books
,
and
mastered
his
passion
by
incessant
attendance
at
the
India
Board
.
<EOS>
The
lady
he
had
loved
had
been
rich
,
and
Lord
Fawn
was
poor
;
but
nevertheless
he
had
mastered
his
passion
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
fear
that
his
feelings
towards
the
governess
would
become
too
warm
;
 
nor
was
it
likely
that
Miss
Morris
should
encounter
danger
in
regard
to
him
.
<EOS>
It
was
quite
an
understood
thing
in
the
family
that
Lord
Fawn
must
marry
money
.
  
<EOS>
Lucy
Morris
was
indeed
a
treasure
.
<EOS>
No
brighter
face
ever
looked
into
another
to
seek
sympathy
there
,
either
in
mirth
or
woe
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
gleam
in
her
eyes
that
was
almost
magnetic
,
so
sure
was
she
to
obtain
by
it
that
community
of
interest
which
she
desired
,
 
though
it
were
<EOS>
but
for
a
moment
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
was
pompous
,
slow
,
dull
,
and
careful
;
but
even
he
had
given
way
to
it
at
once
.
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
,
too
,
was
very
careful
,
but
she
had
owned
to
herself
long
since
that
she
could
not
bear
to
look
forward
to
any
permanent
severance
.
<EOS>
Of
course
Lucy
would
be
made
over
to
the
Hittaways
,
whose
mother
lived
in
Warwick
Square
,
and
whose
father
was
Chairman
of
the
Board
of
Civil
Appeals
.
<EOS>
The
Hittaways
were
the
only
grandchildren
with
whom
Lady
Fawn
had
as
yet
been
blessed
,
and
of
course
Lucy
must
go
to
the
Hittaways
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
but
a
little
thing
;
 
and
it
can
not
be
said
of
her
,
as
of
Lady
Eustace
,
that
she
was
a
beauty
.
<EOS>
The
charm
of
her
face
consisted
in
the
peculiar
,
watery
brightness
of
her
eyes
,
 
in
the
corners
of
which
it
would
always
seem
that
a
diamond
of
a
tear
was
lurking
whenever
any
matter
of
excitement
was
afoot
.
<EOS>
Her
light
-
brown
hair
was
soft
and
smooth
and
pretty
.
<EOS>
As
hair
it
was
very
well
,
but
it
had
no
speciality
.
<EOS>
Her
mouth
was
somewhat
large
,
but
full
of
ever
-
varying
expression
.
<EOS>
Her
forehead
was
low
and
broad
,
with
prominent
temples
,
on
which
it
was
her
habit
to
clasp
tightly
her
little
outstretched
fingers
as
she
sat
listening
to
you
.
<EOS>
Of
listeners
she
was
the
very
best
,
for
she
would
always
be
saying
a
word
or
two
,
just
to
help
you
,
 
the
best
word
that
could
be
spoken
,
and
then
again
she
would
be
hanging
on
your
lips
.
<EOS>
There
are
listeners
who
show
by
their
mode
of
listening
that
they
listen
as
a
duty
,
 
not
because
they
are
interested
.
<EOS>
Lucy
Morris
was
not
such
a
one
.
<EOS>
She
would
take
up
your
subject
,
whatever
it
was
,
and
make
it
her
own
.
<EOS>
There
was
forward
just
then
a
question
as
to
whether
the
Sawab
of
Mygawb
should
have
twenty
millions
of
rupees
paid
to
him
and
be
placed
upon
a
throne
,
or
whether
he
should
be
kept
in
prison
all
his
life
.
<EOS>
The
British
world
generally
could
not
be
made
to
interest
itself
about
the
Sawab
,
but
Lucy
positively
mastered
the
subject
,
and
almost
got
Lord
Fawn
into
a
difficulty
by
persuading
him
to
stand
up
against
his
chief
on
behalf
of
the
injured
prince
.
  
<EOS>
What
else
can
be
said
of
her
face
or
personal
appearance
that
will
interest
a
reader
?
<EOS>
When
she
smiled
,
there
was
the
daintiest
little
dimple
on
her
cheek
.
<EOS>
And
when
she
laughed
,
that
little
nose
,
which
was
not
as
well
-
shaped
a
nose
as
it
might
have
been
,
would
almost
change
its
shape
and
cock
itself
up
in
its
mirth
.
<EOS>
Her
hands
were
very
thin
and
long
,
and
so
were
her
feet
,
 
by
no
means
models
as
were
those
of
her
friend
Lady
Eustace
.
<EOS>
She
was
a
little
,
thin
,
quick
,
graceful
creature
,
whom
it
was
impossible
that
you
should
see
without
wishing
to
have
near
you
.
<EOS>
A
most
unselfish
little
creature
she
was
,
but
one
who
had
a
well
-
formed
idea
of
her
own
identity
.
<EOS>
She
was
quite
resolved
to
be
somebody
among
her
fellow
-
creatures
,
 
not
somebody
in
the
way
of
marrying
a
lord
or
a
rich
man
,
or
somebody
in
the
way
of
being
a
beauty
,
or
somebody
as
a
wit
;
but
somebody
as
having
a
purpose
and
a
use
in
life
.
<EOS>
She
was
the
humblest
little
thing
in
the
world
in
regard
to
any
possible
putting
of
herself
forward
or
needful
putting
of
herself
back
;
and
yet
,
to
herself
,
nobody
was
her
superior
.
<EOS>
What
she
had
was
her
own
,
whether
it
was
the
old
grey
silk
dress
which
she
had
bought
with
the
money
she
had
earned
,
or
the
wit
which
nature
had
given
her
.
<EOS>
And
Lord
Fawn
's
title
was
his
own
,
and
Lady
Fawn
's
rank
her
own
.
<EOS>
She
coveted
no
man
's
possessions
,
 
and
no
woman
's
;
but
she
was
minded
to
hold
by
her
own
.
<EOS>
Of
present
advantages
or
disadvantages
,
 
whether
she
had
the
one
or
suffered
from
the
other
,
 
she
thought
not
at
all
.
<EOS>
It
was
her
fault
that
she
had
nothing
of
feminine
vanity
.
<EOS>
But
no
man
or
woman
was
ever
more
anxious
to
be
effective
,
to
persuade
,
to
obtain
belief
,
sympathy
,
and
co
-
operation
;
 
not
for
any
result
personal
to
herself
,
but
because
,
by
obtaining
these
things
,
she
could
be
effective
in
the
object
then
before
her
,
be
it
what
it
might
.
  
<EOS>
One
other
thing
may
be
told
of
her
.
<EOS>
She
had
given
her
heart
,
 
for
good
and
all
,
as
she
owned
to
herself
,
 
to
Frank
Greystock
.
<EOS>
She
had
owned
to
herself
that
it
was
so
,
and
had
owned
to
herself
that
nothing
could
come
of
it
.
<EOS>
Frank
was
becoming
a
man
of
mark
,
 
but
was
becoming
a
man
of
mark
without
much
money
.
<EOS>
Of
all
men
he
was
the
last
who
could
afford
to
marry
a
governess
.
<EOS>
And
then
,
moreover
,
he
had
never
said
a
word
to
make
her
think
that
he
loved
her
.
<EOS>
He
had
called
on
her
once
or
twice
at
Fawn
Court
,
 
as
why
should
he
not
?
<EOS>
Seeing
that
there
had
been
friendship
between
the
families
for
so
many
years
,
who
could
complain
of
that
?
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
,
however
,
had
 
not
complained
,
but
just
said
a
word
.
<EOS>
A
word
in
season
<EOS>
,
how
good
is
it
?
<EOS>
Lucy
did
not
much
regard
the
word
spoken
to
herself
;
but
when
she
reflected
that
a
word
must
also
have
been
spoken
to
Mr.
Greystock
,
 
otherwise
how
should
it
have
been
that
he
never
came
again
?
 
<EOS>
that
she
did
not
like
.
  
<EOS>
In
herself
she
regarded
this
passion
of
hers
as
a
healthy
man
regards
the
loss
of
a
leg
or
an
arm
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
great
nuisance
,
a
loss
that
maims
the
whole
life
,
 
a
misfortune
to
be
much
regretted
.
<EOS>
But
because
a
leg
is
gone
,
everything
is
not
gone
.
<EOS>
A
man
with
a
wooden
leg
may
stump
about
through
much
action
,
and
may
enjoy
the
keenest
pleasures
of
humanity
.
<EOS>
He
has
his
eyes
left
to
him
,
and
his
ears
,
and
his
intellect
.
<EOS>
He
will
not
break
his
heart
for
the
loss
of
that
leg
.
<EOS>
And
so
it
was
with
Lucy
Morris
.
<EOS>
She
would
still
stump
about
and
be
very
active
.
<EOS>
Eyes
,
ears
,
and
intellect
were
left
to
her
.
<EOS>
Looking
at
her
position
,
she
told
herself
that
a
happy
love
could
hardly
have
been
her
lot
in
life
.
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
,
she
thought
,
was
right
.
<EOS>
A
governess
should
make
up
her
mind
to
do
without
a
lover
.
<EOS>
She
had
given
away
her
heart
,
and
yet
she
would
do
without
a
lover
.
<EOS>
When
,
on
one
dull
,
dark
afternoon
,
as
she
was
thinking
of
all
this
,
Lord
Fawn
suddenly
put
into
her
hands
a
cruelly
long
printed
document
respecting
the
Sawab
,
she
went
to
work
upon
it
immediately
.
<EOS>
As
she
read
it
,
she
could
not
refrain
from
thinking
how
wonderfully
Frank
Greystock
would
plead
the
cause
of
the
Indian
prince
,
if
the
privilege
of
pleading
it
could
be
given
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
The
spring
had
come
round
,
with
May
and
the
London
butterflies
,
at
the
time
at
which
our
story
begins
,
and
during
six
months
Frank
Greystock
had
not
been
at
Fawn
Court
.
<EOS>
Then
one
day
Lady
Eustace
came
down
with
her
ponies
,
and
her
footman
,
and
a
new
dear
friend
of
hers
,
Miss
Macnulty
.
<EOS>
While
Miss
Macnulty
was
being
honoured
by
Lady
Fawn
,
Lizzie
had
retreated
to
a
corner
with
her
old
dear
friend
Lucy
Morris
.
<EOS>
It
was
pretty
to
see
how
so
wealthy
and
fashionable
a
woman
as
Lady
Eustace
could
show
so
much
friendship
to
a
governess
.
"
<EOS>
Have
you
seen
Frank
,
lately
?
"
said
Lady
Eustace
,
referring
to
her
cousin
the
barrister
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
for
ever
so
long
,
"
said
Lucy
,
with
her
cheeriest
smile
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
not
going
to
prove
a
false
knight
?
"
asked
Lady
Eustace
,
in
her
lowest
whisper
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
that
Mr.
Greystock
is
much
given
to
knighthood
at
all
,
"
said
Lucy
,
 
"
unless
it
is
to
being
made
Sir
Francis
by
his
party
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nonsense
,
my
dear
;
as
if
I
did
n't
know
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
Lady
Fawn
has
been
interfering
 
like
an
old
cat
as
she
is
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
is
not
an
old
cat
,
Lizzie
!
<EOS>
and
I
wo
n't
hear
her
called
so
.
<EOS>
If
you
think
so
,
you
should
n't
come
here
.
<EOS>
And
she
has
n't
interfered
.
<EOS>
That
is
,
she
has
done
nothing
that
she
ought
not
to
have
done
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
she
has
interfered
,
"
said
Lady
Eustace
,
as
she
got
up
and
walked
across
the
room
,
with
a
sweet
smile
to
the
old
cat
.
   
<EOS>
Frank
Greystock
 
<EOS>
Frank
Greystock
<EOS>
the
barrister
was
the
only
son
of
the
Dean
of
Bobsborough
.
<EOS>
Now
the
dean
had
a
family
of
daughters
,
 
not
quite
so
numerous
indeed
as
that
of
Lady
Fawn
,
for
there
were
only
three
of
them
,
 
and
was
by
no
means
a
rich
man
.
<EOS>
Unless
a
dean
have
a
private
fortune
,
or
has
chanced
to
draw
the
happy
lot
of
Durham
in
the
lottery
of
deans
,
he
can
hardly
be
wealthy
.
<EOS>
At
Bobsborough
the
dean
was
endowed
with
a
large
,
rambling
,
picturesque
,
uncomfortable
house
,
and
with
£
1,500
a
year
.
<EOS>
In
regard
to
personal
property
it
may
be
asserted
of
all
the
Greystocks
that
they
never
had
any
.
<EOS>
They
were
a
family
of
which
the
males
would
surely
come
to
be
deans
and
admirals
,
and
the
females
would
certainly
find
husbands
.
<EOS>
And
they
lived
on
the
good
things
of
the
world
,
and
mixed
with
wealthy
people
.
<EOS>
But
they
never
had
any
money
.
<EOS>
The
Eustaces
always
had
money
,
and
the
Bishop
of
Bobsborough
was
wealthy
.
<EOS>
The
dean
was
a
man
very
different
from
his
brother
the
admiral
,
who
had
never
paid
anybody
anything
.
<EOS>
The
dean
did
pay
;
but
he
was
a
little
slow
in
his
payments
,
and
money
with
him
was
never
very
plentiful
.
<EOS>
In
these
circumstances
it
became
very
expedient
that
Frank
Greystock
should
earn
his
bread
early
in
life
.
  
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
he
had
chosen
a
profession
which
is
not
often
lucrative
at
first
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
called
to
the
Bar
,
and
had
gone
,
 
and
was
still
going
,
 
the
circuit
in
which
lies
the
cathedral
city
of
Bobsborough
.
<EOS>
Bobsborough
is
not
much
of
a
town
,
and
was
honoured
with
the
judges
'
visits
only
every
other
circuit
.
<EOS>
Frank
began
pretty
well
,
getting
some
little
work
in
London
,
and
perhaps
nearly
enough
to
pay
the
cost
of
his
circuit
out
of
the
county
in
which
the
cathedral
was
situated
.
<EOS>
But
he
began
life
after
that
impecunious
fashion
for
which
the
Greystocks
have
been
noted
.
<EOS>
Tailors
,
robemakers
,
and
booksellers
gave
him
trust
,
and
did
believe
that
they
would
get
their
money
.
<EOS>
And
any
persistent
tradesman
did
get
it
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
actually
hoist
the
black
flag
of
impecuniosity
,
and
proclaim
his
intention
of
preying
generally
upon
the
retail
dealers
,
as
his
uncle
the
admiral
had
done
.
<EOS>
But
he
became
known
as
a
young
man
with
whom
money
was
"
tight
.
<EOS>
"
All
this
had
been
going
on
for
three
or
four
years
before
he
had
met
Lucy
Morris
at
the
deanery
.
<EOS>
He
was
then
eight
-
and
-
twenty
,
and
had
been
four
years
called
.
<EOS>
He
was
thirty
when
old
Lady
Fawn
hinted
to
him
that
he
had
better
not
pay
any
more
visits
at
Fawn
Court
.
  
<EOS>
But
things
had
much
altered
with
him
of
late
.
<EOS>
At
the
time
of
that
visit
to
the
deanery
he
had
made
a
sudden
start
in
his
profession
.
<EOS>
The
Corporation
of
the
City
of
London
had
brought
an
action
against
the
Bank
of
England
with
reference
to
certain
alleged
encroachments
,
of
which
action
,
considerable
as
it
was
in
all
its
interests
,
no
further
notice
need
be
taken
here
than
is
given
by
the
statement
that
a
great
deal
of
money
in
this
cause
had
found
its
way
among
the
lawyers
.
<EOS>
Some
of
it
penetrated
into
the
pocket
of
Frank
Greystock
;
but
he
earned
more
than
money
,
better
than
money
,
out
of
that
affair
.
<EOS>
It
was
attributed
to
him
by
the
attorneys
that
the
Bank
of
England
was
saved
from
the
necessity
of
reconstructing
all
its
bullion
-
cellars
,
and
he
had
made
his
character
for
industry
.
<EOS>
In
the
year
after
that
the
Bobsborough
people
were
rather
driven
into
a
corner
in
search
of
a
clever
young
Conservative
candidate
for
the
borough
,
and
Frank
Greystock
was
invited
to
stand
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
thought
that
there
was
much
chance
of
success
,
and
the
dean
was
against
it
.
<EOS>
But
Frank
liked
the
honour
and
glory
of
the
contest
,
and
so
did
Frank
's
mother
.
<EOS>
Frank
Greystock
stood
,
and
at
the
time
in
which
he
was
warned
away
from
Fawn
Court
had
been
nearly
a
year
in
Parliament
.
<EOS>
"
Of
course
it
does
interfere
with
one
's
business
,
"
he
had
said
to
his
father
,
"
but
then
it
brings
one
business
also
.
<EOS>
A
man
with
a
seat
in
Parliament
who
shows
that
he
means
work
will
always
get
nearly
as
much
work
as
he
can
do
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Such
was
Frank
's
exposition
to
his
father
.
<EOS>
It
may
perhaps
not
be
found
to
hold
water
in
all
cases
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Dean
was
of
course
delighted
with
her
son
's
success
,
and
so
were
the
girls
.
<EOS>
Women
like
to
feel
that
the
young
men
belonging
to
them
are
doing
something
in
the
world
,
so
that
a
reflected
glory
may
be
theirs
.
<EOS>
It
was
pleasant
to
talk
of
Frank
as
member
for
the
city
.
<EOS>
Brothers
do
not
always
care
much
for
a
brother
's
success
,
but
a
sister
is
generally
sympathetic
.
<EOS>
If
Frank
would
only
marry
money
,
there
was
nothing
he
might
not
achieve
.
<EOS>
That
he
would
live
to
sit
on
the
woolsack
<EOS>
was
now
almost
a
certainty
to
the
dear
old
lady
.
<EOS>
But
in
order
that
he
might
sit
there
comfortably
it
was
necessary
that
he
should
at
least
abstain
from
marrying
a
poor
wife
.
<EOS>
For
there
was
fear
at
the
deanery
also
in
regard
to
Lucy
Morris
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
notion
of
marrying
money
as
you
call
it
,
"
Frank
said
to
his
second
sister
Margaret
,
"
is
the
most
disgusting
idea
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
as
easy
to
love
a
girl
who
has
something
as
one
who
has
nothing
,
"
said
Margaret
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
 
it
is
not
;
because
the
girls
with
money
are
scarce
,
and
those
without
it
are
plentiful
,
 
an
argument
of
which
I
do
n't
suppose
you
see
the
force
.
<EOS>
"
Then
Margaret
for
the
moment
was
snubbed
and
retired
.
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
,
Frank
,
I
think
Lady
Fawn
was
right
,
"
said
the
mother
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
I
think
she
was
quite
wrong
.
<EOS>
If
there
be
anything
in
it
,
it
wo
n't
be
expelled
by
Lady
Fawn
's
interference
.
<EOS>
Do
you
think
I
should
allow
Lady
Fawn
to
tell
me
not
to
choose
such
or
such
a
woman
for
my
wife
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
the
habit
of
seeing
her
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
Nobody
loves
Lucy
Morris
better
than
I
do
.
<EOS>
We
all
like
her
.
<EOS>
But
,
dear
Frank
,
would
it
do
for
you
to
make
her
your
wife
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Frank
Greystock
was
silent
for
a
moment
,
and
then
he
answered
his
mother
's
question
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
quite
sure
whether
it
would
or
would
not
.
<EOS>
But
I
do
think
this
 
<EOS>
that
if
I
were
bold
enough
to
marry
now
,
and
to
trust
all
to
the
future
,
and
could
get
Lucy
to
be
my
wife
,
I
should
be
doing
a
great
thing
.
<EOS>
I
doubt
,
however
,
whether
I
have
the
courage
.
<EOS>
"
All
of
which
made
the
dean
's
wife
uneasy
.
  
<EOS>
The
reader
,
who
has
read
so
far
,
will
perhaps
think
that
Frank
Greystock
was
in
love
with
Lucy
as
Lucy
was
in
love
with
him
.
<EOS>
But
such
was
not
exactly
the
case
.
<EOS>
To
be
in
love
,
as
an
absolute
,
well
-
marked
,
acknowledged
fact
,
is
the
condition
of
a
woman
more
frequently
and
more
readily
than
of
a
man
.
<EOS>
Such
is
not
the
common
theory
on
the
matter
,
as
it
is
the
man
's
business
to
speak
,
and
the
woman
's
business
to
be
reticent
.
<EOS>
And
the
woman
is
presumed
to
have
kept
her
heart
free
from
any
load
of
love
,
till
she
may
accept
the
burthen
with
an
assurance
that
it
shall
become
a
joy
and
a
comfort
to
her
.
<EOS>
But
such
presumptions
,
though
they
may
be
very
useful
for
the
regulation
of
conduct
,
may
not
be
always
true
.
<EOS>
It
comes
more
within
the
scope
of
a
woman
's
mind
,
than
that
of
a
man
's
,
to
think
closely
and
decide
sharply
on
such
a
matter
.
<EOS>
With
a
man
it
is
often
chance
that
settles
the
question
for
him
.
<EOS>
He
resolves
to
propose
to
a
woman
,
or
proposes
without
resolving
,
because
she
is
close
to
him
.
<EOS>
Frank
Greystock
ridiculed
the
idea
of
Lady
Fawn
's
interference
in
so
high
a
matter
as
his
love
,
 
or
abstinence
from
love
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
had
he
been
made
a
welcome
guest
at
Fawn
Court
,
he
would
undoubtedly
have
told
his
love
to
Lucy
Morris
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
a
welcome
guest
,
but
had
been
banished
;
and
,
as
a
consequence
of
that
banishment
,
he
had
formed
no
resolution
in
regard
to
Lucy
,
and
did
not
absolutely
know
whether
she
was
necessary
to
him
or
not
.
<EOS>
But
Lucy
Morris
knew
all
about
it
.
  
<EOS>
Moreover
,
it
frequently
happens
with
men
that
they
fail
to
analyse
these
things
,
and
do
not
make
out
for
themselves
any
clear
definition
of
what
their
feelings
are
or
what
they
mean
.
<EOS>
We
hear
that
a
man
has
behaved
badly
to
a
girl
,
when
the
behaviour
of
which
he
has
been
guilty
has
resulted
simply
from
want
of
thought
.
<EOS>
He
has
found
a
certain
companionship
to
be
agreeable
to
him
,
and
he
has
accepted
the
pleasure
without
inquiry
.
<EOS>
Some
vague
idea
has
floated
across
his
brain
that
the
world
is
wrong
in
supposing
that
such
friendship
can
not
exist
without
marriage
,
or
question
of
marriage
.
<EOS>
It
is
simply
friendship
.
<EOS>
And
yet
were
his
friend
to
tell
him
that
she
intended
to
give
herself
in
marriage
elsewhere
,
he
would
suffer
all
the
pangs
of
jealousy
,
and
would
imagine
himself
to
be
horribly
ill
-
treated
!
<EOS>
To
have
such
a
friend
,
 
a
friend
whom
he
can
not
or
will
not
make
his
wife
,
 
is
no
injury
to
him
.
<EOS>
To
him
it
is
simply
a
delight
,
an
excitement
in
life
,
a
thing
to
be
known
to
himself
only
and
not
talked
of
to
others
,
a
source
of
pride
and
inward
exultation
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
joy
to
think
of
when
he
wakes
,
and
a
consolation
in
his
little
troubles
.
<EOS>
It
dispels
the
weariness
of
life
,
and
makes
a
green
spot
of
holiday
within
his
daily
work
.
<EOS>
It
is
,
indeed
,
death
to
her
;
 
but
he
does
not
know
it
.
<EOS>
Frank
Greystock
did
think
that
he
could
not
marry
Lucy
Morris
without
making
an
imprudent
plunge
into
deep
water
,
and
yet
he
felt
that
Lady
Fawn
was
an
ill
-
natured
old
woman
for
hinting
to
him
that
he
had
better
not
,
for
the
present
,
continue
his
visits
to
Fawn
Court
.
<EOS>
"
Of
course
you
understand
me
,
Mr.
Greystock
,
"
she
had
said
,
meaning
to
be
civil
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
When
Miss
Morris
has
left
us
,
 
should
she
ever
leave
us
,
 
I
should
be
most
happy
to
see
you
.
"
<EOS>
"
What
on
earth
would
take
me
to
Fawn
Court
,
if
Lucy
were
not
there
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
to
himself
,
 
not
choosing
to
appreciate
Lady
Fawn
's
civility
.
  
<EOS>
Frank
Greystock
was
at
this
time
nearly
thirty
years
old
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
good
-
looking
,
but
not
strikingly
handsome
man
;
thin
,
of
moderate
height
,
with
sharp
grey
eyes
,
a
face
clean
shorn
with
the
exception
of
a
small
whisker
,
with
wiry
,
strong
dark
hair
,
which
was
already
beginning
to
show
a
tinge
of
grey
;
 
the
very
opposite
in
appearance
to
his
late
friend
Sir
Florian
Eustace
.
<EOS>
He
was
quick
,
ready
-
witted
,
self
-
reliant
,
and
not
over
scrupulous
in
the
outward
things
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
He
was
desirous
of
doing
his
duty
to
others
,
but
he
was
specially
desirous
that
others
should
do
their
duty
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
intended
to
get
on
in
the
world
,
and
believed
that
happiness
was
to
be
achieved
by
success
.
<EOS>
He
was
certainly
made
for
the
profession
which
he
had
adopted
.
<EOS>
His
father
,
looking
to
certain
morsels
of
Church
patronage
which
occasionally
came
in
his
way
,
and
to
the
fact
that
he
and
the
bishop
were
on
most
friendly
terms
,
had
wished
his
son
to
take
orders
.
<EOS>
But
Frank
had
known
himself
and
his
own
qualities
too
well
to
follow
his
father
's
advice
.
<EOS>
He
had
chosen
to
be
a
barrister
,
and
now
,
at
thirty
,
he
was
in
Parliament
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
been
asked
to
stand
for
Bobsborough
in
the
Conservative
interest
,
and
as
a
Conservative
he
had
been
returned
.
<EOS>
Those
who
invited
him
knew
probably
but
little
of
his
own
political
beliefs
or
feelings
,
 
did
not
,
probably
,
know
whether
he
had
any
.
<EOS>
His
father
was
a
fine
old
Tory
of
the
ancient
school
,
who
thought
that
things
were
going
from
bad
to
worse
,
but
was
able
to
live
happily
in
spite
of
his
anticipations
.
<EOS>
The
dean
was
one
of
those
old
-
world
politicians
,
 
we
meet
them
every
day
,
and
they
are
generally
pleasant
people
,
 
who
enjoy
the
politics
of
the
side
to
which
they
belong
without
any
special
belief
in
them
.
<EOS>
If
pressed
hard
they
will
almost
own
that
their
so
-
called
convictions
are
prejudices
.
<EOS>
But
not
for
worlds
would
they
be
rid
of
them
.
<EOS>
When
two
or
three
of
them
meet
together
,
they
are
as
freemasons
,
who
are
bound
by
a
pleasant
bond
which
separates
them
from
the
outer
world
.
<EOS>
They
feel
among
themselves
that
everything
that
is
being
done
is
bad
,
 
even
though
that
everything
is
done
by
their
own
party
.
<EOS>
It
was
bad
to
interfere
with
Charles
,
bad
to
endure
Cromwell
,
bad
to
banish
James
,
bad
to
put
up
with
William
.
<EOS>
The
House
of
Hanover
was
bad
.
<EOS>
All
interference
with
prerogative
has
been
bad
.
<EOS>
The
Reform
bill
was
very
bad
.
<EOS>
Encroachment
on
the
estates
of
the
bishops
was
bad
.
<EOS>
Emancipation
of
Roman
Catholics
was
the
worst
of
all
.
<EOS>
Abolition
of
corn
-
laws
,
church
-
rates
,
and
oaths
and
tests
were
all
bad
.
<EOS>
The
meddling
with
the
Universities
has
been
grievous
.
<EOS>
The
treatment
of
the
Irish
Church
has
been
Satanic
.
<EOS>
The
overhauling
of
schools
is
most
injurious
to
English
education
.
<EOS>
Education
bills
and
Irish
land
bills
were
all
bad
.
<EOS>
Every
step
taken
has
been
bad
.
<EOS>
And
yet
to
them
old
England
is
of
all
countries
in
the
world
the
best
to
live
in
,
and
is
not
at
all
the
less
comfortable
because
of
the
changes
that
have
been
made
.
<EOS>
These
people
are
ready
to
grumble
at
every
boon
conferred
on
them
,
and
yet
to
enjoy
every
boon
.
<EOS>
They
know
,
too
,
their
privileges
,
and
,
after
a
fashion
,
understand
their
position
.
<EOS>
It
is
picturesque
,
and
it
pleases
them
.
<EOS>
To
have
been
always
in
the
right
and
yet
always
on
the
losing
side
;
always
being
ruined
,
always
under
persecution
from
a
wild
spirit
of
republican
-
demagogism
,
 
and
yet
never
to
lose
anything
,
not
even
position
or
public
esteem
,
is
pleasant
enough
.
<EOS>
A
huge
,
living
,
daily
increasing
grievance
that
does
one
no
palpable
harm
,
is
the
happiest
possession
that
a
man
can
have
.
<EOS>
There
is
a
large
body
of
such
men
in
England
,
and
,
personally
,
they
are
the
very
salt
of
the
nation
.
<EOS>
He
who
said
that
all
Conservatives
are
stupid
did
not
know
them
.
<EOS>
Stupid
Conservatives
there
may
be
,
 
and
there
certainly
are
very
stupid
Radicals
.
<EOS>
The
well
-
educated
,
widely
-
read
Conservative
,
who
is
well
assured
that
all
good
things
are
gradually
being
brought
to
an
end
by
the
voice
of
the
people
,
is
generally
the
pleasantest
man
to
be
met
.
<EOS>
But
he
is
a
Buddhist
,
possessing
a
religious
creed
which
is
altogether
dark
and
mysterious
to
the
outer
world
.
<EOS>
Those
who
watch
the
ways
of
the
advanced
Buddhist
hardly
know
whether
the
man
does
believe
himself
in
his
hidden
god
,
but
men
perceive
that
he
is
respectable
,
self
-
satisfied
,
and
a
man
of
note
.
<EOS>
It
is
of
course
from
the
society
of
such
that
Conservative
candidates
are
to
be
sought
;
but
,
alas
,
it
is
hard
to
indoctrinate
young
minds
with
the
old
belief
,
since
new
theories
of
life
have
become
so
rife
!
  
<EOS>
Nevertheless
Frank
Greystock
,
when
he
was
invited
to
stand
for
Bobsborough
in
the
Conservative
interest
,
had
not
for
a
moment
allowed
any
political
heterodoxy
on
his
own
part
to
stand
in
the
way
of
his
advancement
.
<EOS>
It
may
,
perhaps
,
be
the
case
that
a
barrister
is
less
likely
to
be
influenced
by
personal
convictions
in
taking
his
side
in
politics
than
any
other
man
who
devotes
himself
to
public
affairs
.
<EOS>
No
slur
on
the
profession
is
intended
by
this
suggestion
.
<EOS>
A
busy
,
clever
,
useful
man
,
who
has
been
at
work
all
his
life
,
finds
that
his
own
progress
towards
success
demands
from
him
that
he
shall
become
a
politician
.
<EOS>
The
highest
work
of
a
lawyer
can
only
be
reached
through
political
struggle
.
<EOS>
As
a
large
-
minded
man
of
the
world
,
peculiarly
conversant
with
the
fact
that
every
question
has
two
sides
,
and
that
as
much
may
often
be
said
on
one
side
as
on
the
other
,
he
has
probably
not
become
violent
in
his
feelings
as
a
political
partisan
.
<EOS>
Thus
he
sees
that
there
is
an
opening
here
or
an
opening
there
,
and
the
offence
in
either
case
is
not
great
to
him
.
<EOS>
With
Frank
Greystock
the
matter
was
very
easy
.
<EOS>
There
certainly
was
no
apostasy
.
<EOS>
He
had
now
and
again
attacked
his
father
's
ultra
-
Toryism
,
and
rebuked
his
mother
and
sisters
when
they
spoke
of
Gladstone
as
Apollyon
,
and
called
John
Bright
the
Abomination
of
Desolation
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
easy
to
him
to
fancy
himself
a
Conservative
,
and
as
such
he
took
his
seat
in
the
House
without
any
feeling
of
discomfort
.
  
<EOS>
During
the
first
four
months
of
his
first
session
he
had
not
spoken
,
 
but
he
had
made
himself
useful
.
<EOS>
He
had
sat
on
one
or
two
Committees
,
though
as
a
barrister
he
might
have
excused
himself
,
and
had
done
his
best
to
learn
the
forms
of
the
House
.
<EOS>
But
he
had
already
begun
to
find
that
the
time
which
he
devoted
to
Parliament
was
much
wanted
for
his
profession
.
<EOS>
Money
was
very
necessary
to
him
.
<EOS>
Then
a
new
idea
was
presented
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
John
Eustace
and
Greystock
were
very
intimate
,
 
as
also
had
been
Sir
Florian
and
Greystock
.
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
what
I
wish
you
'd
do
,
Greystock
,
"
Eustace
said
to
him
one
day
,
as
they
were
standing
idly
together
in
the
lobby
of
the
House
.
<EOS>
For
John
Eustace
was
also
in
Parliament
.
  
<EOS>
"
Anything
to
oblige
you
,
my
friend
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
only
a
trifle
,
"
said
Eustace
.
<EOS>
"
Just
to
marry
your
cousin
,
my
brother
's
widow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
By
Jove
,
 
I
wish
I
had
the
chance
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
see
why
you
should
n't
.
<EOS>
She
is
sure
to
marry
somebody
,
and
at
her
age
so
she
ought
.
<EOS>
She
's
not
twenty
-
three
yet
.
<EOS>
We
could
trust
you
,
 
with
the
child
and
all
the
rest
of
it
.
<EOS>
As
it
is
,
she
is
giving
us
a
deal
of
trouble
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
my
dear
fellow
 
"
  
"
I
know
she
's
fond
of
you
.
<EOS>
You
were
dining
there
last
Sunday
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
so
was
Fawn
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
is
the
man
to
marry
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
You
see
if
he
does
n't
.
<EOS>
He
was
uncommonly
sweet
on
her
the
other
night
,
and
really
interested
her
about
the
Sawab
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
'll
never
be
Lady
Fawn
,
"
said
John
Eustace
.
<EOS>
"
And
to
tell
the
truth
,
I
should
n't
care
to
have
to
deal
with
Lord
Fawn
.
<EOS>
He
would
be
infinitely
troublesome
;
and
I
can
hardly
wash
my
hands
of
her
affairs
.
<EOS>
She
's
worth
nearly
£
5,000
a
year
as
long
as
she
lives
,
and
I
really
do
n't
think
that
she
's
much
amiss
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Much
amiss
!
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
whether
she
's
not
the
prettiest
woman
I
ever
saw
,
"
said
Greystock
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
 
but
I
mean
in
conduct
,
and
all
that
.
<EOS>
She
is
making
herself
queer
;
and
Camperdown
,
our
lawyer
,
means
to
jump
upon
her
;
but
it
's
only
because
she
does
n't
know
what
she
ought
to
be
at
,
and
what
she
ought
not
.
<EOS>
You
could
tell
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
would
n't
suit
me
at
all
to
have
to
quarrel
with
Camperdown
,
"
said
the
barrister
,
laughing
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
and
he
would
settle
everything
in
five
minutes
,
and
it
would
save
me
a
world
of
trouble
,
"
said
Eustace
.
  
<EOS>
"
Fawn
is
your
man
;
 
take
my
word
for
it
,
"
said
Greystock
,
as
he
walked
back
into
the
House
.

Dramatists
,
when
they
write
their
plays
,
have
a
delightful
privilege
of
prefixing
a
list
of
their
personages
;
 
and
the
dramatists
of
old
used
to
tell
us
who
was
in
love
with
whom
,
and
what
were
the
blood
relationships
of
all
the
persons
.
<EOS>
In
such
a
narrative
as
this
,
any
proceeding
of
that
kind
would
be
unusual
,
 
and
therefore
the
poor
narrator
has
been
driven
to
expend
his
first
four
chapters
in
the
mere
task
of
introducing
his
characters
.
<EOS>
He
regrets
the
length
of
these
introductions
,
and
will
now
begin
at
once
the
action
of
his
story
.
   
<EOS>
The
Eustace
Necklace
 
<EOS>
John
Eustace
,
Lady
Eustace
's
brother
-
in
-
law
,
had
told
his
friend
Greystock
,
the
lady
's
cousin
,
that
Mr.
Camperdown
the
lawyer
intended
to
"
jump
upon
"
that
lady
.
<EOS>
Making
such
allowance
and
deduction
from
the
force
of
these
words
as
the
slang
expression
requires
,
we
may
say
that
John
Eustace
was
right
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Camperdown
was
in
earnest
,
and
did
intend
to
obtain
the
restoration
of
those
jewels
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Camperdown
was
a
gentleman
of
about
sixty
,
who
had
been
lawyer
to
Sir
Florian
's
father
,
and
whose
father
had
been
lawyer
to
Sir
Florian
's
grandfather
.
<EOS>
His
connexion
with
the
property
and
with
the
family
was
of
a
nature
to
allow
him
to
take
almost
any
liberty
with
the
Eustaces
.
<EOS>
When
therefore
John
Eustace
,
in
regard
to
those
diamonds
,
had
pleaded
that
the
heir
in
his
long
minority
would
obtain
ample
means
of
buying
more
diamonds
,
and
of
suggesting
that
the
plunder
for
the
sake
of
tranquillity
should
be
allowed
,
Mr.
Camperdown
took
upon
himself
to
say
that
he
'd
"
be
 
---
if
he
'd
put
up
with
it
!
"
<EOS>
"
I
really
do
n't
know
what
you
are
to
do
,
"
said
John
Eustace
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
file
a
bill
in
Chancery
if
it
's
necessary
,
"
said
the
old
lawyer
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Heaven
on
earth
!
<EOS>
as
trustee
how
are
you
to
reconcile
yourself
to
such
a
robbery
?
<EOS>
They
represent
£
500
a
year
for
ever
,
and
she
is
to
have
them
simply
because
she
chooses
to
take
them
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
Florian
could
have
given
them
away
.
<EOS>
At
any
rate
he
could
have
sold
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
that
,
"
said
Mr.
Camperdown
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
looked
as
yet
,
but
I
think
that
this
necklace
has
been
made
an
heirloom
.
<EOS>
At
any
rate
it
represents
an
amount
of
property
that
should
n't
and
could
n't
be
made
over
legally
without
some
visible
evidence
of
transfer
.
<EOS>
It
's
as
clear
a
case
of
stealing
as
I
ever
knew
in
my
life
,
and
as
bad
a
case
.
<EOS>
She
had
n't
a
farthing
,
and
she
has
got
the
whole
of
the
Ayrshire
property
for
her
life
.
<EOS>
She
goes
about
and
tells
everybody
that
it
's
hers
to
sell
to
-
morrow
if
she
pleases
to
sell
it
!
<EOS>
No
,
John
;
 
"
Mr.
Camperdown
had
known
Eustace
when
he
was
a
boy
,
and
had
watched
him
become
a
man
,
and
had
n't
yet
learned
to
drop
the
name
by
which
he
had
called
the
boy
,
 
"
we
must
n't
allow
it
.
<EOS>
What
do
you
think
of
her
applying
to
me
for
an
income
to
support
her
child
,
 
a
baby
not
yet
two
years
old
?
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Camperdown
had
been
very
adverse
to
all
the
circumstances
of
Sir
Florian
's
marriage
,
and
had
subjected
himself
to
Sir
Florian
's
displeasure
for
expressing
his
opinion
.
<EOS>
He
had
tried
to
explain
that
as
the
lady
brought
no
money
into
the
family
she
was
not
entitled
to
such
a
jointure
as
Sir
Florian
was
determined
to
lavish
upon
her
.
<EOS>
But
Sir
Florian
had
been
obstinate
,
 
both
in
regard
to
the
settlement
and
the
will
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
till
after
Sir
Florian
's
death
that
this
terrible
matter
of
the
jewels
had
even
suggested
itself
to
Mr.
Camperdown
.
<EOS>
The
jewellers
in
whose
custody
the
things
had
been
since
the
death
of
the
late
Lady
Eustace
had
mentioned
the
affair
to
him
immediately
on
the
young
widow
's
return
from
Naples
.
<EOS>
Sir
Florian
had
withdrawn
,
not
all
the
jewels
,
but
by
far
the
most
valuable
of
them
,
from
the
jewellers
"
care
on
his
return
to
London
from
their
marriage
tour
to
Scotland
,
and
this
was
the
result
.
<EOS>
The
jewellers
were
at
that
time
without
any
doubt
as
to
the
date
at
which
the
necklace
was
taken
from
them
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Camperdown
's
first
attempt
was
made
by
a
most
courteous
and
even
complimentary
note
,
in
which
he
suggested
to
Lady
Eustace
that
it
would
be
for
the
advantage
of
all
parties
that
the
family
jewels
should
be
kept
together
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
as
she
read
this
note
smiled
,
and
said
to
herself
that
she
did
not
exactly
see
how
her
own
interests
would
be
best
served
by
such
an
arrangement
.
<EOS>
She
made
no
answer
to
Mr.
Camperdown
's
note
.
<EOS>
Some
months
after
this
,
when
the
heir
was
born
,
and
as
Lady
Eustace
was
passing
through
London
on
her
journey
from
Bobsborough
to
Portray
,
a
meeting
had
been
arranged
between
her
and
Mr.
Camperdown
.
<EOS>
She
had
endeavoured
by
all
the
wiles
she
knew
to
avoid
this
meeting
,
but
it
had
been
forced
upon
her
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
almost
given
to
understand
that
unless
she
submitted
to
it
,
she
would
not
be
able
to
draw
her
income
from
the
Portray
property
.
<EOS>
Messrs.
Mowbray
and
Mopus
had
advised
her
to
submit
.
<EOS>
"
My
husband
gave
me
a
necklace
,
and
they
want
me
to
give
it
back
,
"
she
had
said
to
Mr.
Mopus
.
<EOS>
"
Do
nothing
of
the
kind
,
"
Mr.
Mopus
had
replied
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
find
it
necessary
,
refer
Mr.
Camperdown
to
us
.
<EOS>
We
will
answer
him
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
interview
had
taken
place
,
during
which
Mr.
Camperdown
took
the
trouble
to
explain
very
plainly
and
more
than
once
that
the
income
from
the
Portray
property
belonged
to
Lady
Eustace
for
her
life
only
.
<EOS>
It
would
after
her
death
be
rejoined
,
of
necessity
,
to
the
rest
of
the
Eustace
property
.
<EOS>
This
was
repeated
to
Lady
Eustace
in
the
presence
of
John
Eustace
;
but
she
made
no
remark
on
being
so
informed
.
<EOS>
"
You
understand
the
nature
of
the
settlement
,
Lady
Eustace
?
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Camperdown
had
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
believe
I
understand
everything
,
"
she
replied
.
<EOS>
Then
,
just
at
the
close
of
the
interview
,
he
asked
a
question
about
the
jewels
.
<EOS>
Lady
Eustace
at
first
made
no
reply
.
<EOS>
"
They
might
as
well
be
sent
back
to
Messrs.
Garnett
's
,
"
said
Mr.
Camperdown
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
that
I
have
any
to
send
back
,
"
she
answered
;
and
then
she
escaped
before
Mr.
Camperdown
was
able
to
arrange
any
further
attack
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
manage
with
her
better
by
letter
than
I
can
personally
,
"
he
said
to
John
Eustace
.
  
<EOS>
Lawyers
such
as
Mr.
Camperdown
are
slow
,
and
it
was
three
or
four
months
after
that
when
he
wrote
a
letter
in
his
own
name
to
Lady
Eustace
,
explaining
to
her
,
still
courteously
,
that
it
was
his
business
to
see
that
the
property
of
the
Eustace
family
was
placed
in
fit
hands
,
and
that
a
certain
valuable
necklace
of
diamonds
,
which
was
an
heirloom
of
the
family
,
and
which
was
undeniably
the
property
of
the
heir
,
was
believed
to
be
in
her
custody
.
<EOS>
As
such
property
was
peculiarly
subject
to
risks
,
would
she
have
the
kindness
to
make
arrangements
for
handing
over
the
necklace
to
the
custody
of
the
Messrs.
Garnett
?
<EOS>
To
this
letter
Lizzie
made
no
answer
whatever
,
nor
did
she
to
a
second
note
,
calling
attention
to
the
first
.
<EOS>
When
John
Eustace
told
Greystock
that
Camperdown
intended
to
"
jump
on
"
Lady
Eustace
,
the
following
further
letter
had
been
written
by
the
firm
;
 
but
up
to
that
time
<EOS>
Lizzie
had
not
replied
to
it
:
  
62
,
New
Square
,
Lincoln
's
Inn
,
May
5
,

MADAM

It

our
duty
as

estate
of
your
late
husband
Sir
Florian
Eustace
,
and
in
the
interest
of
your

his
heir

to
ask
for
restitution
of
a
certain
valuable
diamond
necklace
which
is

now
in
the
possession
of
your

more

once
on
the
subject

has
not

<EOS>
Doubtless
had
there
been

mistake

to
the
necklace
being

informed

<EOS>
The
diamonds
were
withdrawn
from
Messrs.
Garnett
's
,
the
jewellers
,
by
Sir
Florian
soon
after
his
marriage
,
and
were
,
no
doubt
,
entrusted
to
your
keeping
.
<EOS>
They
are
appanages
of
the
family
which
should
not
be
in
your
hands
as
the
widow
of
the
late
baronet
,
and
they
constitute
an
amount
of
property
which
certainly
can
not
be
alienated
from
the
family
without
inquiry
or
right
,
as
might
any
trifling
article
either
of
use
or
ornament
.
<EOS>
The
jewels
are
valued
at
over
£
10,000
.
  
<EOS>
We
are
reluctantly
compelled
,
by
the
fact
of
your
having
left
unanswered
three
letters
from
Mr.
Camperdown
,
Senior
,
on
the
subject
,
to
explain
to
you
that
if
attention
be
not
paid
to
this
letter
,
we
shall
be
obliged
,
in
the
performance
of
our
duty
,
to
take
legal
steps
for
the
restitution
of
the
property
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
the
honour
to
be
,
Madam
,
Your
ladyship
's
most
obedient
servants
,
  
CAMPERDOWN
&
SON
.
  
<EOS>
To
Lady
Eustace
.
<EOS>
&
c.
&
c.
  
<EOS>
A
few
days
after
it
was
sent
old
Mr.
Camperdown
got
the
letter
-
book
of
the
office
and
read
the
letter
to
John
Eustace
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
see
how
you
're
to
get
them
,
"
said
Eustace
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
'll
throw
upon
her
the
burthen
of
showing
that
they
have
become
legally
her
property
.
<EOS>
She
ca
n't
do
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Suppose
she
sold
them
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
'll
follow
them
up
.
<EOS>
£
10,000
,
my
dear
John
!
<EOS>
God
bless
my
soul
!
<EOS>
it
's
a
magnificent
dowry
for
a
daughter
,
 
an
ample
provision
for
a
younger
son
.
<EOS>
And
she
is
to
be
allowed
to
filch
it
,
as
other
widows
filch
china
cups
,
and
a
silver
teaspoon
or
two
!
<EOS>
It
's
quite
a
common
thing
,
but
I
never
heard
of
such
a
haul
as
this
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
will
be
very
unpleasant
,
"
said
Eustace
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
then
she
still
goes
about
everywhere
declaring
that
the
Portray
property
is
her
own
.
<EOS>
She
's
a
bad
lot
.
<EOS>
I
knew
it
from
the
first
.
<EOS>
Of
course
we
shall
have
trouble
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Then
Mr.
Eustace
explained
to
the
lawyer
that
their
best
way
out
of
it
all
would
be
to
get
the
widow
married
to
some
respectable
husband
.
<EOS>
She
was
sure
to
marry
sooner
or
later
,
 
so
John
Eustace
said
,
 
and
any
"
decently
decent
"
fellow
would
be
easier
to
deal
with
than
she
herself
.
"
<EOS>
He
must
be
very
indecently
indecent
if
he
is
not
,
"
said
Mr.
Camperdown
.
<EOS>
But
Mr.
Eustace
did
not
name
Frank
Greystock
the
barrister
as
the
probable
future
decent
husband
.
  
<EOS>
When
Lizzie
first
got
the
letter
,
which
she
did
on
the
day
after
the
visit
at
Fawn
Court
of
which
mention
has
been
made
,
she
put
it
by
unread
for
a
couple
of
days
.
<EOS>
She
opened
it
,
not
knowing
the
clerk
's
handwriting
,
but
read
only
the
first
line
and
the
signature
.
<EOS>
For
two
days
she
went
on
with
the
ordinary
affairs
and
amusements
of
her
life
,
as
though
no
such
letter
had
reached
her
;
but
she
was
thinking
of
it
all
the
time
.
<EOS>
The
diamonds
were
in
her
possession
,
and
she
had
had
them
valued
by
her
old
friend
Mr.
Benjamin
 
of
the
firm
of
Harter
and
Benjamin
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Benjamin
had
suggested
that
stones
of
such
a
value
should
not
be
left
to
the
risk
of
an
ordinary
London
house
;
but
Lizzie
had
felt
that
if
Mr.
Benjamin
got
them
into
his
hands
,
Mr.
Benjamin
might
perhaps
not
return
them
.
<EOS>
Messrs.
Camperdown
and
Garnett
between
them
might
form
a
league
with
Mr.
Benjamin
.
<EOS>
Where
would
she
be
,
should
Mr.
Benjamin
tell
her
that
under
some
legal
sanction
he
had
given
the
jewels
up
to
Mr.
Camperdown
?
<EOS>
She
hinted
to
Mr.
Benjamin
that
she
would
perhaps
sell
them
if
she
got
a
good
offer
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Benjamin
,
who
was
very
familiar
with
her
,
hinted
that
there
might
be
a
little
family
difficulty
.
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
none
in
the
least
,
"
said
Lizzie
;
 
"
<EOS>
but
I
do
n't
think
I
shall
part
with
them
.
<EOS>
"
Then
she
gave
Mr.
Benjamin
an
order
for
a
strong
box
,
which
was
supplied
to
her
.
<EOS>
The
strong
box
,
which
was
so
heavy
that
she
could
barely
lift
it
herself
,
was
now
in
her
London
bedroom
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
morning
of
the
third
day
she
read
the
letter
.
<EOS>
Miss
Macnulty
was
staying
with
her
,
but
she
had
not
said
a
word
to
Miss
Macnulty
about
the
letter
.
<EOS>
She
read
it
up
in
her
own
bedroom
,
and
then
sat
down
to
think
about
it
.
<EOS>
Sir
Florian
,
as
he
had
handed
to
her
the
stones
for
the
purpose
of
a
special
dinner
party
which
had
been
given
to
them
when
passing
through
London
,
had
told
her
that
they
were
family
jewels
.
<EOS>
"
That
setting
was
done
for
my
mother
,
"
he
said
,
"
but
it
is
already
old
.
<EOS>
When
we
are
at
home
again
they
shall
be
reset
.
"
<EOS>
Then
he
had
added
some
little
husband
's
joke
as
to
a
future
daughter
-
in
-
law
who
should
wear
them
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
she
was
not
sure
whether
the
fact
of
their
being
so
handed
to
her
did
not
make
them
her
own
.
<EOS>
She
had
spoken
a
second
time
to
Mr.
Mopus
,
and
Mr.
Mopus
had
asked
her
whether
there
existed
any
family
deed
as
to
the
diamonds
.
<EOS>
She
had
heard
of
no
such
deed
,
nor
did
Mr.
Camperdown
mention
such
a
deed
.
<EOS>
After
reading
the
letter
once
she
read
it
a
dozen
times
;
and
then
,
like
a
woman
,
made
up
her
mind
that
her
safest
course
would
be
not
to
answer
it
.
  
<EOS>
But
yet
she
felt
sure
that
something
unpleasant
would
come
of
it
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Camperdown
was
not
a
man
to
take
up
such
a
question
and
to
let
it
drop
.
<EOS>
Legal
steps
!
<EOS>
What
did
legal
steps
mean
,
and
what
could
they
do
to
her
?
<EOS>
Would
Mr.
Camperdown
be
able
to
put
her
in
prison
,
 
or
to
take
away
from
her
the
estate
of
Portray
?
<EOS>
She
could
swear
that
her
husband
had
given
them
to
her
,
and
could
invent
any
form
of
words
she
pleased
as
accompanying
the
gift
.
<EOS>
No
one
else
had
been
near
them
then
.
<EOS>
But
she
was
,
and
felt
herself
to
be
absolutely
,
alarmingly
ignorant
,
not
only
of
the
laws
,
but
of
custom
in
such
matters
.
<EOS>
Messrs.
Mowbray
and
Mopus
and
Mr.
Benjamin
were
the
allies
to
whom
she
looked
for
guidance
;
but
she
was
wise
enough
to
know
that
Mowbray
and
Mopus
,
and
Harter
and
Benjamin
were
not
trustworthy
,
whereas
Camperdown
and
Son
and
the
Messrs.
Garnett
were
all
as
firm
as
rocks
and
as
respectable
as
the
Bank
of
England
.
<EOS>
Circumstances
,
 
unfortunate
circumstances
,
 
drove
her
to
Harter
and
Benjamin
and
to
Mowbray
and
Mopus
,
while
she
would
have
taken
so
much
delight
in
feeling
the
strong
honesty
of
the
other
people
to
be
on
her
side
!
<EOS>
She
would
have
talked
to
her
friends
about
Mr.
Camperdown
and
the
people
at
Garnett
's
with
so
much
satisfaction
!
<EOS>
But
ease
,
security
,
and
even
respectability
may
be
bought
too
dearly
.
<EOS>
Ten
thousand
pounds
!
<EOS>
Was
she
prepared
to
surrender
such
a
sum
as
that
?
<EOS>
She
had
,
indeed
,
already
realised
the
fact
that
it
might
be
very
difficult
to
touch
the
money
.
<EOS>
When
she
had
suggested
to
Mr.
Benjamin
that
he
should
buy
the
jewels
,
that
worthy
tradesman
had
by
no
means
jumped
at
the
offer
.
<EOS>
Of
what
use
to
her
would
be
a
necklace
always
locked
up
in
an
iron
box
,
which
box
,
for
aught
she
knew
,
myrmidons
from
Mr.
Camperdown
might
carry
off
during
her
absence
from
the
house
?
<EOS>
Would
it
not
be
better
to
come
to
terms
and
surrender
?
<EOS>
But
then
what
should
the
terms
be
?
  
<EOS>
If
only
there
had
been
a
friend
whom
she
could
consult
;
a
friend
whom
she
could
consult
on
a
really
friendly
footing
!
 
<EOS>
not
a
simply
respectable
,
off
-
handed
,
high
-
minded
friend
,
who
would
advise
her
as
a
matter
of
course
to
make
restitution
.
<EOS>
Her
uncle
the
dean
,
or
her
cousin
Frank
,
or
old
Lady
Fawn
,
would
be
sure
to
give
her
such
advice
as
that
.
<EOS>
There
are
people
who
are
so
very
high
-
minded
when
they
have
to
deal
with
the
interests
of
their
friends
!
<EOS>
What
if
she
were
to
ask
Lord
Fawn
?
  
<EOS>
Thoughts
of
a
second
marriage
had
,
of
course
,
crossed
Lady
Eustace
's
mind
,
and
they
were
by
no
means
the
worst
thoughts
that
found
a
place
there
.
<EOS>
She
had
a
grand
idea
,
 
this
selfish
,
hard
-
fisted
little
woman
,
who
could
not
bring
herself
to
abandon
the
plunder
on
which
she
had
laid
her
hand
,
 
a
grand
idea
of
surrendering
herself
and
all
her
possessions
to
a
great
passion
.
<EOS>
For
Florian
Eustace
she
had
never
cared
.
<EOS>
She
had
sat
down
by
his
side
,
and
looked
into
his
handsome
face
,
and
read
poetry
to
him
,
 
because
of
his
wealth
,
and
because
it
had
been
indispensable
to
her
to
settle
herself
well
.
<EOS>
And
he
had
been
all
very
well
,
 
a
generous
,
open
-
hearted
,
chivalrous
,
irascible
,
but
rather
heavy
-
minded
gentleman
;
but
she
had
never
been
in
love
with
him
.
<EOS>
Now
she
desired
to
be
so
in
love
that
she
could
surrender
everything
to
her
love
.
<EOS>
There
was
as
yet
nothing
of
such
love
in
her
bosom
.
<EOS>
She
had
seen
no
one
who
had
so
touched
her
.
<EOS>
But
she
was
alive
to
the
romance
of
the
thing
,
and
was
in
love
with
the
idea
of
being
in
love
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
,
"
she
would
say
to
herself
in
her
moments
of
solitude
,
"
if
I
had
a
Corsair
of
my
own
,
how
I
would
sit
on
watch
for
my
lover
's
boat
by
the
sea
-
shore
!
"
<EOS>
And
she
believed
it
of
herself
,
that
she
could
do
so
.
  
<EOS>
But
it
would
also
be
very
nice
to
be
a
peeress
,
 
so
that
she
might
,
without
any
doubt
,
be
one
of
the
great
ladies
of
London
.
<EOS>
As
a
baronet
's
widow
with
a
large
income
,
she
was
already
almost
a
great
lady
;
but
she
was
quite
alive
to
a
suspicion
that
she
was
not
altogether
strong
in
her
position
.
<EOS>
The
bishop
's
people
and
the
dean
's
people
did
not
quite
trust
her
.
<EOS>
The
Camperdowns
and
Garnetts
utterly
distrusted
her
.
<EOS>
The
Mopuses
and
Benjamins
were
more
familiar
than
they
would
be
with
a
really
great
lady
.
<EOS>
She
was
sharp
enough
to
understand
all
this
.
<EOS>
Should
it
be
Lord
Fawn
or
should
it
be
a
Corsair
?
<EOS>
The
worst
of
Lord
Fawn
was
the
undoubted
fact
that
he
was
not
himself
a
great
man
.
<EOS>
He
could
,
no
doubt
,
make
his
wife
a
peeress
;
but
he
was
poor
,
encumbered
with
a
host
of
sisters
,
dull
as
a
blue
-
book
,
and
possessed
of
little
beyond
his
peerage
to
recommend
him
.
<EOS>
If
she
could
only
find
a
peer
,
unmarried
,
with
a
dash
of
the
Corsair
about
him
!
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
,
what
was
she
to
do
about
the
jewels
?
  
<EOS>
There
was
staying
with
her
at
this
time
a
certain
Miss
Macnulty
,
who
was
related
,
after
some
distant
fashion
,
to
old
Lady
Linlithgow
,
and
who
was
as
utterly
destitute
of
possessions
or
means
of
existence
as
any
unfortunate
,
well
-
born
,
and
moderately
-
educated
,
middle
-
aged
woman
in
London
.
<EOS>
To
live
upon
her
friends
,
such
as
they
might
be
,
was
the
only
mode
of
life
within
her
reach
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
that
she
had
chosen
such
dependence
;
nor
,
indeed
,
had
she
endeavoured
to
reject
it
.
<EOS>
It
had
come
to
her
as
a
matter
of
course
,
 
either
that
or
the
poor
-
house
.
<EOS>
As
to
earning
her
bread
,
except
by
that
attendance
which
a
poor
friend
gives
,
 
the
idea
of
any
possibility
that
way
had
never
entered
her
head
.
<EOS>
She
could
do
nothing
,
 
except
dress
like
a
lady
with
the
smallest
possible
cost
,
and
endeavour
to
be
obliging
.
<EOS>
Now
,
at
this
moment
,
her
condition
was
terribly
precarious
.
<EOS>
She
had
quarrelled
with
Lady
Linlithgow
,
and
had
been
taken
in
by
her
old
friend
Lizzie
,
 
her
old
enemy
might
,
perhaps
,
be
a
truer
expression
,
 
because
of
that
quarrel
.
<EOS>
But
a
permanent
home
had
not
even
been
promised
to
her
;
and
poor
Miss
Macnulty
was
aware
that
even
a
permanent
home
with
Lady
Eustace
would
not
be
an
unmixed
blessing
.
<EOS>
In
her
way
,
Miss
Macnulty
was
an
honest
woman
.
  
<EOS>
They
were
sitting
together
one
May
afternoon
in
the
little
back
drawing
-
room
in
Mount
Street
.
<EOS>
They
had
dined
early
,
were
now
drinking
tea
,
and
intended
to
go
to
the
opera
.
<EOS>
It
was
six
o'clock
,
and
was
still
broad
day
,
but
the
thick
coloured
blind
was
kept
across
the
single
window
,
and
the
folding
doors
of
the
room
were
nearly
closed
,
and
there
was
a
feeling
of
evening
in
the
room
.
<EOS>
The
necklace
during
the
whole
day
had
been
so
heavy
on
Lizzie
's
heart
,
that
she
had
been
unable
to
apply
her
thoughts
to
the
building
of
that
castle
in
the
air
in
which
the
Corsair
was
to
reign
supreme
,
but
not
alone
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
,
"
she
said
,
 
she
generally
called
Miss
Macnulty
<EOS>
my
dear
,
 
<EOS>
"
you
know
that
box
I
had
made
by
the
jewellers
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
mean
the
safe
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
 
yes
;
only
it
is
n't
a
safe
.
<EOS>
A
safe
is
a
great
big
thing
.
<EOS>
I
had
it
made
especially
for
the
diamonds
Sir
Florian
gave
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
supposed
it
was
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
whether
there
's
any
danger
about
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
were
you
,
Lady
Eustace
,
I
would
n't
keep
them
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
them
kept
where
Sir
Florian
kept
them
.
<EOS>
Suppose
anybody
should
come
and
murder
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
not
a
bit
afraid
of
that
,
"
said
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
be
.
<EOS>
And
what
will
you
do
with
it
when
you
go
to
Scotland
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
took
them
with
me
before
;
 
in
my
own
care
.
<EOS>
I
know
that
was
n't
safe
.
<EOS>
I
wish
I
knew
what
to
do
with
them
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
are
people
who
keep
such
things
,
"
said
Miss
Macnulty
.
  
<EOS>
Then
Lizzie
paused
a
moment
.
<EOS>
She
was
dying
for
counsel
and
for
confidence
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
trust
them
anywhere
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
just
possible
there
may
be
a
lawsuit
about
them
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
a
lawsuit
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
explain
it
all
,
but
I
am
very
unhappy
about
it
.
<EOS>
They
want
me
to
give
them
up
;
 
but
my
husband
gave
them
to
me
,
and
for
his
sake
I
will
not
do
so
.
<EOS>
When
he
threw
them
round
my
neck
<EOS>
he
told
me
that
they
were
my
own
;
 
so
he
did
.
<EOS>
How
can
a
woman
give
up
such
a
present
,
 
from
a
husband
,
 
who
is
dead
?
<EOS>
As
to
the
value
,
I
care
nothing
.
<EOS>
But
I
wo
n't
do
it
.
<EOS>
"
By
this
time
Lady
Eustace
was
in
tears
,
and
had
so
far
succeeded
as
to
have
produced
some
amount
of
belief
in
Miss
Macnulty
's
mind
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
they
are
your
own
,
they
ca
n't
take
them
from
you
,
"
said
Miss
Macnulty
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
sha'n't
.
<EOS>
They
shall
find
that
I
've
got
some
spirit
left
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Then
she
reflected
that
a
real
Corsair
lover
would
protect
her
jewels
for
her
;
 
would
guard
them
against
a
score
of
Camperdowns
.
<EOS>
But
she
doubted
whether
Lord
Fawn
would
do
much
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
Then
the
door
was
opened
,
and
Lord
Fawn
was
announced
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
at
all
unusual
with
Lord
Fawn
to
call
on
the
widow
at
this
hour
.
<EOS>
Mount
Street
is
not
exactly
in
the
way
from
the
India
Office
to
the
House
of
Lords
;
but
a
Hansom
cab
can
make
it
almost
in
the
way
.
<EOS>
Of
neglect
of
official
duty
Lord
Fawn
was
never
guilty
;
but
a
half
hour
for
private
business
or
for
relaxation
between
one
stage
of
duty
and
another
,
 
can
any
Minister
grudge
so
much
to
an
indefatigable
follower
?
<EOS>
Lady
Eustace
had
been
in
tears
as
he
was
announced
,
but
the
light
of
the
room
was
so
low
that
the
traces
of
them
could
hardly
be
seen
.
<EOS>
She
was
in
her
Corsair
state
of
mind
,
divided
between
her
jewels
and
her
poetry
,
and
caring
not
very
much
for
the
increased
rank
which
Lord
Fawn
could
give
her
.
"
<EOS>
The
Sawab
's
case
is
coming
on
in
the
House
of
Commons
this
very
night
,
"
he
said
,
in
answer
to
a
question
from
Miss
Macnulty
.
<EOS>
Then
he
turned
to
Lady
Eustace
.
"
<EOS>
Your
cousin
,
Mr.
Greystock
,
is
going
to
ask
a
question
in
the
House
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Shall
you
be
there
to
answer
him
?
"
asked
Miss
Macnulty
innocently
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
dear
,
no
.
<EOS>
But
I
shall
be
present
.
<EOS>
A
peer
can
go
,
you
know
.
"
<EOS>
Then
Lord
Fawn
,
at
considerable
length
,
explained
to
the
two
ladies
the
nature
and
condition
of
the
British
Parliament
.
<EOS>
Miss
Macnulty
experienced
an
innocent
pleasure
in
having
such
things
told
to
her
by
a
lord
.
<EOS>
Lady
Eustace
knew
that
this
was
the
way
in
which
Lord
Fawn
made
love
,
and
thought
that
from
him
it
was
as
good
as
any
other
way
.
<EOS>
If
she
were
to
marry
a
second
time
simply
with
the
view
of
being
a
peeress
,
of
having
a
respected
husband
,
and
making
good
her
footing
in
the
world
,
she
would
as
lief
listen
to
parliamentary
details
and
the
prospects
of
the
Sawab
as
to
any
other
matters
.
<EOS>
She
knew
very
well
that
no
Corsair
propensities
would
be
forthcoming
from
Lord
Fawn
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
had
just
worked
himself
round
to
the
Sawab
again
,
when
Frank
Greystock
entered
the
room
.
<EOS>
"
Now
we
have
both
the
Houses
represented
,
"
said
Lady
Eustace
,
as
she
welcomed
her
cousin
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
intend
to
ask
your
question
about
the
Sawab
to
-
night
?
"
asked
Lord
Fawn
,
with
intense
interest
,
feeling
that
,
had
it
been
his
lot
to
perform
that
task
before
he
went
to
his
couch
,
he
would
at
this
moment
have
been
preparing
his
little
speech
.
  
<EOS>
But
Frank
Greystock
had
not
come
to
his
cousin
's
house
to
talk
of
the
Prince
of
the
Mygawb
territory
.
<EOS>
When
his
friend
Eustace
had
suggested
to
him
that
he
should
marry
the
widow
,
he
had
ridiculed
the
idea
;
 
but
nevertheless
he
had
thought
of
it
a
good
deal
.
<EOS>
He
was
struggling
hard
,
working
diligently
,
making
for
himself
a
character
in
Parliament
,
succeeding
,
 
<EOS>
so
said
all
his
friends
,
 
as
a
barrister
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
rising
young
man
,
one
of
those
whose
names
began
to
be
much
in
the
mouths
of
other
men
;
 
but
still
he
was
poor
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
to
himself
that
among
other
good
gifts
that
of
economy
had
not
been
bestowed
upon
him
.
<EOS>
He
owed
a
little
money
,
and
though
he
owed
it
,
he
went
on
spending
his
earnings
.
<EOS>
He
wanted
just
such
a
lift
in
the
world
as
a
wife
with
an
income
would
give
him
.
<EOS>
As
for
looking
about
for
a
girl
whom
he
could
honestly
love
,
and
who
should
have
a
fortune
of
her
own
as
well
as
beauty
,
birth
,
and
all
the
other
things
,
 
<EOS>
that
was
out
of
his
reach
.
<EOS>
If
he
talked
to
himself
of
love
,
if
he
were
ever
to
acknowledge
to
himself
that
love
was
to
have
sway
over
him
,
then
must
Lucy
Morris
be
the
mistress
of
his
heart
.
<EOS>
He
had
come
to
know
enough
about
himself
to
be
aware
of
that
;
 
but
he
knew
also
that
he
had
said
nothing
binding
him
to
walk
in
that
path
.
<EOS>
It
was
quite
open
to
him
to
indulge
a
discreet
ambition
without
dishonour
.
<EOS>
Therefore
he
also
had
come
to
call
upon
the
beautiful
widow
.
<EOS>
The
courtship
with
her
<EOS>
he
knew
need
not
be
long
.
<EOS>
He
could
ask
her
to
marry
him
to
-
morrow
,
 
as
for
that
matter
to
-
day
,
 
without
a
feeling
of
hesitation
.
<EOS>
She
might
accept
him
or
might
reject
him
;
but
,
as
he
said
to
himself
,
in
neither
case
would
any
harm
be
done
.
  
<EOS>
An
idea
of
the
same
kind
flitted
across
Lizzie
's
mind
as
she
sat
and
talked
to
the
two
gentlemen
.
<EOS>
She
knew
that
her
cousin
Frank
was
poor
,
but
she
thought
that
she
could
fall
in
love
with
him
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
exactly
a
Corsair
;
 
but
he
was
a
man
who
had
certain
Corsair
propensities
.
<EOS>
He
was
bold
and
dashing
,
unscrupulous
and
clever
,
a
man
to
make
a
name
for
himself
,
and
one
to
whom
a
woman
could
endure
to
be
obedient
.
<EOS>
There
could
be
no
question
as
to
choice
between
him
and
Lord
Fawn
,
if
she
were
to
allow
herself
to
choose
by
liking
.
<EOS>
And
she
thought
that
Frank
Greystock
would
keep
the
necklace
,
if
he
himself
were
made
to
have
an
interest
in
the
necklace
;
whereas
Lord
Fawn
would
undoubtedly
surrender
it
at
once
to
Mr.
Camperdown
.
  
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
had
some
slight
idea
of
waiting
to
see
the
cousin
go
;
but
as
Greystock
had
a
similar
idea
,
and
as
he
was
the
stronger
of
the
two
,
of
course
Lord
Fawn
went
.
<EOS>
He
perhaps
remembered
that
the
Hansom
cab
was
at
the
door
,
 
costing
sixpence
every
fifteen
minutes
,
 
and
that
he
wished
to
show
himself
in
the
House
of
Lords
before
the
peers
rose
.
<EOS>
Miss
Macnulty
also
left
the
room
,
and
Frank
was
alone
with
the
widow
.
<EOS>
"
Lizzie
,
"
said
he
,
"
you
must
be
very
solitary
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
solitary
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
hardly
happy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Anything
but
happy
,
Frank
.
<EOS>
I
have
things
that
make
me
very
unhappy
;
 
<EOS>
one
thing
that
I
will
tell
you
if
you
will
let
me
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Frank
had
almost
made
up
his
mind
to
ask
her
on
the
spot
to
give
him
permission
to
console
all
her
sorrows
,
when
there
came
a
clattering
double
-
knock
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
"
They
know
I
shall
be
at
home
to
nobody
else
now
,
"
said
Lady
Eustace
.
<EOS>
But
Frank
Greystock
had
hardly
regained
his
self
-
possession
when
Miss
Macnulty
hurried
into
the
room
,
and
,
with
a
look
almost
of
horror
,
declared
that
Lady
Linlithgow
was
in
the
parlour
.
   
<EOS>
Lady
Linlithgow
's
Mission
 
"
Lady
Linlithgow
!
"
 
<EOS>
said
Frank
Greystock
,
holding
up
both
his
hands
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
indeed
!
"
said
Miss
Macnulty
.
<EOS>
"
I
did
not
speak
to
her
,
but
I
saw
her
.
<EOS>
She
has
sent
her
 
love
to
Lady
Eustace
,
and
begs
that
she
will
see
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lady
Eustace
had
been
so
surprised
by
the
announcement
that
hitherto
she
had
not
spoken
a
word
.
<EOS>
The
quarrel
between
her
and
her
aunt
had
been
of
such
a
nature
that
it
had
seemed
to
be
impossible
that
the
old
countess
should
come
to
Mount
Street
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
had
certainly
behaved
very
badly
to
her
aunt
;
 
about
as
badly
as
a
young
woman
could
behave
to
an
old
woman
.
<EOS>
She
had
accepted
bread
,
and
shelter
,
and
the
very
clothes
on
her
back
from
her
aunt
's
bounty
,
and
had
rejected
even
the
hand
of
her
benefactress
the
first
moment
that
she
had
bread
,
and
shelter
,
and
clothes
of
her
own
.
<EOS>
And
here
was
Lady
Linlithgow
down
-
stairs
in
the
parlour
,
and
sending
up
her
love
to
her
niece
!
<EOS>
"
I
wo
n't
see
her
!
"
said
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
had
better
see
her
,
"
said
Frank
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
see
her
!
"
said
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Good
gracious
,
my
dear
 
what
has
she
come
for
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
says
it
's
very
important
,
"
said
Miss
Macnulty
.
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
you
must
see
her
,
"
said
Frank
.
<EOS>
"
Let
me
get
out
of
the
house
,
and
then
tell
the
servant
to
show
her
up
at
once
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
be
weak
now
,
Lizzie
,
and
I
'll
come
and
find
out
all
about
it
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mind
you
do
,
"
said
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
Then
Frank
took
his
departure
,
and
Lizzie
did
as
she
was
bidden
.
<EOS>
"
You
remain
in
here
,
Julia
,
"
she
said
,
 
"
so
as
to
be
near
if
I
want
you
.
<EOS>
She
shall
come
into
the
front
room
.
"
<EOS>
Then
,
absolutely
shaking
with
fear
of
the
approaching
evil
,
she
took
her
seat
in
the
largest
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
There
was
still
a
little
delay
.
<EOS>
Time
was
given
to
Frank
Greystock
to
get
away
,
and
to
do
so
without
meeting
Lady
Linlithgow
in
the
passage
.
<EOS>
The
message
was
conveyed
by
Miss
Macnulty
to
the
servant
,
and
the
same
servant
opened
the
front
door
for
Frank
before
he
delivered
it
.
<EOS>
Lady
Linlithgow
,
too
,
though
very
strong
,
was
old
.
<EOS>
She
was
slow
,
or
perhaps
it
might
more
properly
be
said
she
was
stately
in
her
movements
.
<EOS>
She
was
one
of
those
old
women
who
are
undoubtedly
old
women
,
 
who
in
the
remembrance
of
younger
people
seem
always
to
have
been
old
women
,
 
but
on
whom
old
age
appears
to
have
no
debilitating
effects
.
<EOS>
If
the
hand
of
Lady
Linlithgow
ever
trembled
,
it
trembled
from
anger
;
 
if
her
foot
ever
faltered
,
it
faltered
for
effect
.
<EOS>
In
her
way
Lady
Linlithgow
was
a
very
powerful
human
being
.
<EOS>
She
knew
nothing
of
fear
,
nothing
of
charity
,
nothing
of
mercy
,
and
nothing
of
the
softness
of
love
.
<EOS>
She
had
no
imagination
.
<EOS>
She
was
worldly
,
covetous
,
and
not
unfrequently
cruel
.
<EOS>
But
she
meant
to
be
true
and
honest
,
though
she
often
failed
in
her
meaning
;
 
and
she
had
an
idea
of
her
duty
in
life
.
<EOS>
She
was
not
self
-
indulgent
.
<EOS>
She
was
as
hard
as
an
oak
post
,
 
<EOS>
but
then
she
was
also
as
trustworthy
.
<EOS>
No
human
being
liked
her
;
 
but
she
had
the
good
word
of
a
great
many
human
beings
.
<EOS>
At
great
cost
to
her
own
comfort
she
had
endeavoured
to
do
her
duty
to
her
niece
,
Lizzie
Greystock
,
when
Lizzie
was
homeless
.
<EOS>
Undoubtedly
Lizzie
's
bed
,
while
it
had
been
spread
under
her
aunt
's
roof
,
had
not
been
one
of
roses
;
but
such
as
it
had
been
,
she
had
endured
to
occupy
it
while
it
served
her
needs
.
<EOS>
She
had
constrained
herself
to
bear
her
aunt
;
 
but
from
the
moment
of
her
escape
she
had
chosen
to
reject
her
aunt
altogether
.
<EOS>
Now
her
aunt
's
heavy
step
was
heard
upon
the
stairs
!
<EOS>
Lizzie
also
was
a
brave
woman
after
a
certain
fashion
.
<EOS>
She
could
dare
to
incur
a
great
danger
for
an
adequate
object
.
<EOS>
But
she
was
too
young
as
yet
to
have
become
mistress
of
that
persistent
courage
which
was
Lady
Linlithgow
's
peculiar
possession
.
  
<EOS>
When
the
countess
entered
the
drawing
-
room
Lizzie
rose
upon
her
legs
,
but
did
not
come
forward
from
her
chair
.
<EOS>
The
old
woman
was
not
tall
;
 
but
her
face
was
long
,
and
at
the
same
time
large
,
square
at
the
chin
and
square
at
the
forehead
,
and
gave
her
almost
an
appearance
of
height
.
<EOS>
Her
nose
was
very
prominent
,
not
beaked
,
but
straight
and
strong
,
and
broad
at
the
bridge
,
and
of
a
dark
-
red
colour
.
<EOS>
Her
eyes
were
sharp
and
grey
.
<EOS>
Her
mouth
was
large
,
and
over
it
there
was
almost
beard
enough
for
a
young
man
's
moustache
.
<EOS>
Her
chin
was
firm
,
and
large
,
and
solid
.
<EOS>
Her
hair
was
still
brown
,
and
was
only
just
grizzled
in
parts
.
<EOS>
Nothing
becomes
an
old
woman
like
grey
hair
,
but
Lady
Linlithgow
's
hair
would
never
be
grey
.
<EOS>
Her
appearance
on
the
whole
was
not
pre
-
possessing
,
but
it
gave
one
an
idea
of
honest
,
real
strength
.
<EOS>
What
one
saw
was
not
buckram
,
whalebone
,
paint
,
and
false
hair
.
<EOS>
It
was
all
human
,
 
hardly
feminine
,
certainly
not
angelic
,
with
perhaps
a
hint
in
the
other
direction
,
 
but
a
human
body
,
and
not
a
thing
of
pads
and
patches
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
,
as
she
saw
her
aunt
,
made
up
her
mind
for
the
combat
.
<EOS>
Who
is
there
that
has
lived
to
be
a
man
or
woman
,
and
has
not
experienced
a
moment
in
which
a
combat
has
impended
,
and
a
call
for
such
sudden
courage
has
been
necessary
?
<EOS>
Alas
!
 
<EOS>
sometimes
the
combat
comes
,
and
the
courage
is
not
there
.
<EOS>
Lady
Eustace
was
not
at
her
ease
as
she
saw
her
aunt
enter
the
room
.
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
come
ye
in
peace
,
or
come
ye
in
war
?
<EOS>
"
she
would
have
said
had
she
dared
.
<EOS>
Her
aunt
had
sent
up
her
love
,
 
if
the
message
had
been
delivered
aright
;
but
what
of
love
could
there
be
between
the
two
?
<EOS>
The
countess
dashed
at
once
to
the
matter
in
hand
,
making
no
allusion
to
Lizzie
's
ungrateful
conduct
to
herself
.
<EOS>
"
Lizzie
,
"
she
said
,
"
I
've
been
asked
to
come
to
you
by
Mr.
Camperdown
.
<EOS>
I
'll
sit
down
,
if
you
please
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
certainly
,
Aunt
Penelope
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Camperdown
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
 
Mr.
Camperdown
.
<EOS>
You
know
who
he
is
.
<EOS>
He
has
been
with
me
because
I
am
your
nearest
relation
.
<EOS>
So
I
am
,
and
therefore
I
have
come
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
like
it
,
I
can
tell
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
As
for
that
,
Aunt
Penelope
,
you
've
done
it
to
please
yourself
,
"
said
Lizzie
,
in
a
tone
of
insolence
with
which
Lady
Linlithgow
had
been
familiar
in
former
days
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
have
n't
,
miss
.
<EOS>
I
have
n't
come
for
my
own
pleasure
at
all
.
<EOS>
I
have
come
for
the
credit
of
the
family
,
if
any
good
can
be
done
towards
saving
it
.
<EOS>
You
've
got
your
husband
's
diamonds
locked
up
somewhere
,
and
you
must
give
them
back
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
husband
's
diamonds
were
my
diamonds
,
"
said
Lizzie
stoutly
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
are
family
diamonds
,
Eustace
diamonds
,
heirlooms
,
 
old
property
belonging
to
the
Eustaces
,
just
like
their
estates
.
<EOS>
Sir
Florian
did
n't
give
"
em
away
,
and
could
n't
,
and
would
n't
if
he
could
.
<EOS>
Such
things
ai
n't
given
away
in
that
fashion
.
<EOS>
It
's
all
nonsense
,
and
you
must
give
them
up
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Who
says
so
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
say
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
nothing
,
Aunt
Penelope
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nothing
,
is
it
?
<EOS>
You
'll
see
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Camperdown
says
so
.
<EOS>
All
the
world
will
say
so
.
<EOS>
If
you
do
n't
take
care
,
you
'll
find
yourself
brought
into
a
court
of
law
,
my
dear
,
and
<EOS>
a
jury
will
say
so
.
<EOS>
That
's
what
it
will
come
to
.
<EOS>
What
good
will
they
do
you
?
<EOS>
You
ca
n't
sell
them
;
 
and
as
a
widow
you
ca
n't
wear
"
em
.
<EOS>
If
you
marry
again
,
you
would
n't
disgrace
your
husband
by
going
about
showing
off
the
Eustace
diamonds
!
<EOS>
But
you
do
n't
know
anything
about
"
proper
feelings
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
know
every
bit
as
much
as
you
do
,
Aunt
Penelope
,
and
I
do
n't
want
you
to
teach
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
give
up
the
jewels
to
Mr.
Camperdown
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
 
I
wo
n't
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Or
to
the
jewellers
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
I
wo
n't
.
<EOS>
I
mean
to
 
keep
them
 
for
 
my
child
.
<EOS>
"
Then
there
came
forth
a
sob
,
and
a
tear
,
and
Lizzie
's
handkerchief
was
held
to
her
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
"
Your
child
!
<EOS>
Would
n't
they
be
kept
properly
for
him
,
and
for
the
family
,
if
the
jewellers
had
them
?
<EOS>
I
do
n't
believe
you
care
about
your
child
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Aunt
Penelope
,
you
had
better
take
care
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
say
just
what
I
think
,
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
You
ca
n't
frighten
me
.
<EOS>
The
fact
is
,
you
are
disgracing
the
family
you
have
married
into
,
and
as
you
are
my
niece
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
'm
not
disgracing
anybody
.
<EOS>
You
are
disgracing
everybody
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
As
you
are
my
niece
,
I
have
undertaken
to
come
to
you
and
to
tell
you
that
if
you
do
n't
give
"
em
up
within
a
week
from
this
time
,
they
'll
proceed
against
you
for
 
stealing
"
em
!
"
<EOS>
Lady
Linlithgow
,
as
she
uttered
this
terrible
threat
,
bobbed
her
head
at
her
niece
in
a
manner
calculated
to
add
very
much
to
the
force
of
her
words
.
<EOS>
The
words
,
and
tone
,
and
gesture
combined
were
,
in
truth
,
awful
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
steal
them
.
<EOS>
My
husband
gave
them
to
me
with
his
own
hands
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
would
n't
answer
Mr.
Camperdown
's
letters
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
That
alone
will
condemn
you
.
<EOS>
After
that
there
is
n't
a
word
to
be
said
about
it
;
 
not
a
word
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Camperdown
is
the
family
lawyer
,
and
when
he
writes
to
you
letter
after
letter
you
take
no
more
notice
of
him
than
a
 
dog
!
"
<EOS>
The
old
woman
was
certainly
very
powerful
.
<EOS>
The
way
in
which
she
pronounced
that
last
word
did
make
Lady
Eustace
ashamed
of
herself
.
<EOS>
"
Why
did
n't
you
answer
his
letters
,
unless
you
knew
you
were
in
the
wrong
?
<EOS>
Of
course
you
knew
you
were
in
the
wrong
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
I
did
n't
.
<EOS>
A
woman
is
n't
obliged
to
answer
everything
that
is
written
to
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
well
!
<EOS>
You
just
say
that
before
the
judge
!
<EOS>
for
you
'll
have
to
go
before
a
judge
.
<EOS>
I
tell
you
,
Lizzie
Greystock
,
or
Eustace
,
or
whatever
your
name
is
,
it
's
downright
picking
and
stealing
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
you
want
to
sell
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wo
n't
stand
this
,
Aunt
Penelope
!
"
<EOS>
said
Lizzie
,
rising
from
her
seat
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
stand
it
;
 
and
you
'll
have
to
stand
worse
than
that
.
<EOS>
You
do
n't
suppose
Mr.
Camperdown
got
me
to
come
here
for
nothing
.
<EOS>
If
you
do
n't
want
to
be
made
out
to
be
a
thief
before
all
the
world
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
wo
n't
stand
it
!
"
<EOS>
shrieked
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
no
business
to
come
here
and
say
such
things
to
me
.
<EOS>
It
's
my
house
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
say
just
what
I
please
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Macnulty
,
come
in
.
"
<EOS>
And
Lizzie
threw
open
the
door
,
hardly
knowing
how
the
very
weak
ally
whom
she
now
invoked
could
help
her
,
but
driven
by
the
stress
of
the
combat
to
seek
assistance
somewhere
.
<EOS>
Miss
Macnulty
,
who
was
seated
near
the
door
,
and
who
had
necessarily
heard
every
word
of
the
conversation
,
had
no
alternative
but
to
appear
.
<EOS>
Of
all
human
beings
Lady
Linlithgow
was
to
her
the
most
terrible
,
and
yet
,
after
a
fashion
,
she
loved
the
old
woman
.
<EOS>
Miss
Macnulty
was
humble
,
cowardly
,
and
subservient
;
but
she
was
not
a
fool
,
and
she
understood
the
difference
between
truth
and
falsehood
.
<EOS>
She
had
endured
fearful
things
from
Lady
Linlithgow
;
but
she
knew
that
there
might
be
more
of
sound
protection
in
Lady
Linlithgow
's
real
wrath
than
in
Lizzie
's
pretended
affection
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
you
are
there
,
are
you
?
"
said
the
countess
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
 
I
am
here
,
Lady
Linlithgow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Listening
,
I
suppose
.
<EOS>
Well
;
 
so
much
the
better
.
<EOS>
You
know
well
enough
,
and
you
can
tell
her
.
<EOS>
You
ai
n't
a
fool
,
though
I
suppose
you
'll
be
afraid
to
open
your
mouth
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Julia
,
"
said
Lady
Eustace
,
"
will
you
have
the
kindness
to
see
that
my
aunt
is
shown
to
her
carriage
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
stand
her
violence
,
and
I
will
go
up
-
stairs
.
"
<EOS>
So
saying
she
made
her
way
very
gracefully
into
the
back
drawing
-
room
,
whence
she
could
escape
to
her
bed
-
room
.
  
<EOS>
But
her
aunt
fired
a
last
shot
at
her
.
<EOS>
"
Unless
you
do
as
you
're
bid
,
Lizzie
,
you
'll
find
yourself
in
prison
as
sure
as
eggs
!
"
<EOS>
Then
,
when
her
niece
was
beyond
hearing
,
she
turned
to
Miss
Macnulty
.
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
you
've
heard
about
these
diamonds
,
Macnulty
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
she
's
got
them
,
Lady
Linlithgow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
has
no
more
right
to
them
than
you
have
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
you
're
afraid
to
tell
her
<EOS>
so
,
lest
she
should
turn
you
out
;
 
but
<EOS>
it
's
well
she
should
know
it
.
<EOS>
I
've
done
my
duty
.
<EOS>
Never
mind
about
the
servant
.
<EOS>
I
'll
find
my
way
out
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Nevertheless
the
bell
was
rung
,
and
the
countess
was
shown
to
her
carriage
with
proper
consideration
.
  
<EOS>
The
two
ladies
went
to
the
opera
,
and
it
was
not
till
after
their
return
,
and
just
as
they
were
going
to
bed
,
that
anything
further
was
said
about
either
the
necklace
or
the
visit
.
<EOS>
Miss
Macnulty
would
not
begin
the
subject
,
and
Lizzie
purposely
postponed
it
.
<EOS>
But
not
for
a
moment
had
it
been
off
Lady
Eustace
's
mind
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
care
much
for
music
,
though
she
professed
to
do
so
,
 
and
thought
that
she
did
.
<EOS>
But
on
this
night
,
had
she
at
other
times
been
a
slave
to
St.
Cecilia
<EOS>
,
she
would
have
been
free
from
that
thraldom
.
<EOS>
The
old
woman
's
threats
had
gone
into
her
very
heart
's
blood
.
<EOS>
Theft
,
and
prison
,
and
juries
,
and
judges
had
been
thrown
at
her
head
so
violently
that
she
was
almost
stunned
.
<EOS>
Could
it
really
be
the
case
that
they
would
prosecute
her
for
stealing
?
<EOS>
She
was
Lady
Eustace
,
and
who
but
Lady
Eustace
should
have
these
diamonds
or
be
allowed
to
wear
them
?
<EOS>
Nobody
could
say
that
Sir
Florian
had
not
given
them
to
her
.
<EOS>
It
could
not
,
surely
,
be
brought
against
her
as
an
actual
crime
that
she
had
not
answered
Mr.
Camperdown
's
letters
?
<EOS>
And
yet
she
was
not
sure
.
<EOS>
Her
ideas
about
law
and
judicial
proceedings
were
very
vague
.
<EOS>
Of
what
was
wrong
and
what
was
right
<EOS>
she
had
a
distinct
notion
.
<EOS>
She
knew
well
enough
that
she
was
endeavouring
to
steal
the
Eustace
diamonds
;
but
she
did
not
in
the
least
know
what
power
there
might
be
in
the
law
to
prevent
,
or
to
punish
her
for
the
intended
theft
.
<EOS>
She
knew
well
that
the
thing
was
not
really
her
own
;
but
there
were
,
as
she
thought
,
so
many
points
in
her
favour
,
that
she
felt
it
to
be
a
cruelty
that
any
one
should
grudge
her
the
plunder
.
<EOS>
Was
not
she
the
only
Lady
Eustace
living
?
<EOS>
As
to
these
threats
from
Mr.
Camperdown
and
Lady
Linlithgow
,
she
felt
certain
they
would
be
used
against
her
whether
they
were
true
or
false
.
<EOS>
She
would
break
her
heart
<EOS>
should
she
abandon
her
prey
and
afterwards
find
that
Mr.
Camperdown
would
have
been
wholly
powerless
against
her
<EOS>
had
she
held
on
to
it
.
<EOS>
But
then
who
would
tell
her
the
truth
?
<EOS>
She
was
sharp
enough
to
understand
,
or
at
any
rate
suspicious
enough
to
believe
,
that
Mr.
Mopus
would
be
actuated
by
no
other
desire
in
the
matter
than
that
of
running
up
a
bill
against
her
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
,
"
she
said
to
Miss
Macnulty
,
as
they
went
up
-
stairs
after
the
opera
,
"
come
into
my
room
a
moment
.
<EOS>
You
heard
all
that
my
aunt
said
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
could
not
help
hearing
.
<EOS>
You
told
me
to
stay
there
,
and
the
door
was
ajar
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wanted
you
to
hear
.
<EOS>
Of
course
what
she
said
was
the
greatest
nonsense
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
When
she
talked
about
my
being
taken
to
prison
for
not
answering
a
lawyer
's
letter
,
that
must
be
nonsense
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
that
was
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
then
she
is
such
a
ferocious
old
termagant
,
 
such
an
old
vulturess
.
<EOS>
Now
is
n't
she
a
ferocious
old
termagant
?
"
<EOS>
Lizzie
paused
for
an
answer
,
desirous
that
her
companion
should
join
her
in
her
enmity
against
her
aunt
,
but
Miss
Macnulty
was
unwilling
to
say
anything
against
one
who
had
been
her
protectress
,
and
might
,
perhaps
,
be
her
protectress
again
.
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
mean
to
say
you
do
n't
hate
her
?
"
said
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
did
n't
hate
her
after
all
she
has
done
to
you
,
I
should
despise
you
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
hate
her
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
she
's
a
very
upsetting
old
woman
,
"
said
Miss
Macnulty
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
you
poor
creature
!
<EOS>
Is
that
all
you
dare
to
say
about
her
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
obliged
to
be
a
poor
creature
,
"
said
Miss
Macnulty
,
with
a
red
spot
on
each
of
her
cheeks
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Eustace
understood
this
,
and
relented
.
<EOS>
"
But
you
need
n't
be
afraid
,
"
she
said
,
"
to
tell
me
what
you
think
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
About
the
diamonds
,
you
mean
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Yes
;
about
the
diamonds
.
"
  
"
You
have
enough
without
them
.
<EOS>
I
'd
give
"
em
up
for
peace
and
quiet
.
<EOS>
"
That
was
Miss
Macnulty
's
advice
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
 
I
have
n't
enough
;
 
or
nearly
enough
.
<EOS>
I
've
had
to
buy
ever
so
many
things
since
my
husband
died
.
<EOS>
They
've
done
all
they
could
to
be
hard
to
me
.
<EOS>
They
made
me
pay
for
the
very
furniture
at
Portray
.
<EOS>
"
This
was
n't
true
;
but
it
was
true
that
Lizzie
had
endeavoured
to
palm
off
on
the
Eustace
estate
bills
for
new
things
which
she
had
ordered
for
her
own
country
-
house
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
n't
near
enough
.
<EOS>
I
am
in
debt
already
.
<EOS>
People
talked
as
though
I
were
the
richest
woman
in
the
world
;
but
when
it
comes
to
be
spent
,
I
ai
n't
rich
.
<EOS>
Why
should
I
give
them
up
if
they
're
my
own
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
if
they
're
your
own
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
give
you
a
present
and
then
die
,
people
ca
n't
come
and
take
it
away
afterwards
because
I
did
n't
put
it
into
my
will
.
<EOS>
There
'd
be
no
making
presents
like
that
at
all
.
"
<EOS>
This
Lizzie
said
with
an
evident
conviction
in
the
strength
of
her
argument
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
this
necklace
is
so
very
valuable
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
ca
n't
make
a
difference
.
<EOS>
If
a
thing
is
a
man
's
own
he
can
give
it
away
;
 
not
a
house
,
or
a
farm
,
or
a
wood
,
or
anything
like
that
;
but
a
thing
that
he
can
carry
about
with
him
,
 
of
course
he
can
give
it
away
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
perhaps
Sir
Florian
did
n't
mean
to
give
it
for
always
,
"
suggested
Miss
Macnulty
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
perhaps
he
did
.
<EOS>
He
told
me
that
they
were
mine
,
and
I
shall
keep
them
.
<EOS>
So
that
's
the
end
of
it
.
<EOS>
You
can
go
to
bed
now
.
"
<EOS>
And
Miss
Macnulty
went
to
bed
.
  
<EOS>
Lizzie
,
as
she
sat
thinking
of
it
,
owned
to
herself
that
no
help
was
to
be
expected
in
that
quarter
.
<EOS>
She
was
not
angry
with
Miss
Macnulty
,
who
was
,
almost
of
necessity
,
a
poor
creature
.
<EOS>
But
she
was
convinced
more
strongly
than
ever
that
some
friend
was
necessary
to
her
who
should
not
be
a
poor
creature
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
,
though
a
peer
,
was
a
poor
creature
.
<EOS>
Frank
Greystock
she
believed
to
be
as
strong
as
a
house
.
   
<EOS>
Mr.
Burke
's
Speeches
 
Lucy
Morris
had
been
told
by
Lady
Fawn
that
,
 
in
point
of
fact
that
,
being
a
governess
,
she
ought
to
give
over
falling
in
love
with
Frank
Greystock
,
and
she
had
not
liked
it
.
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
no
doubt
had
used
words
less
abrupt
,
 
had
probably
used
but
few
words
,
and
had
expressed
her
meaning
chiefly
by
little
winks
,
and
shakings
of
her
head
,
and
small
gestures
of
her
hands
,
and
had
ended
by
a
kiss
,
 
in
all
of
which
she
had
intended
to
mingle
mercy
with
justice
,
and
had
,
in
truth
,
been
full
of
love
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
Lucy
had
not
liked
it
.
<EOS>
No
girl
likes
to
be
warned
against
falling
in
love
,
whether
the
warning
be
needed
or
not
needed
.
<EOS>
In
this
case
Lucy
knew
very
well
that
the
caution
was
too
late
.
<EOS>
It
might
be
all
very
well
for
Lady
Fawn
to
decide
that
her
governess
should
not
receive
visits
from
a
lover
in
her
house
;
 
and
then
the
governess
might
decide
whether
,
in
those
circumstances
,
she
would
remain
or
go
away
;
but
Lady
Fawn
could
have
no
right
to
tell
her
governess
not
to
be
in
love
.
<EOS>
All
this
Lucy
said
to
herself
over
and
over
again
,
and
yet
she
knew
that
Lady
Fawn
had
treated
her
well
.
<EOS>
The
old
woman
had
kissed
her
,
and
purred
over
her
,
and
praised
her
,
and
had
really
loved
her
.
<EOS>
As
a
matter
of
course
,
Lucy
was
not
entitled
to
have
a
lover
.
<EOS>
Lucy
knew
that
well
enough
.
<EOS>
As
she
walked
alone
among
the
shrubs
she
made
arguments
in
defence
of
Lady
Fawn
as
against
herself
.
<EOS>
And
yet
at
every
other
minute
she
would
blaze
up
into
a
grand
wrath
,
and
picture
to
herself
a
scene
in
which
she
would
tell
Lady
Fawn
boldly
that
as
her
lover
had
been
banished
from
Fawn
Court
,
she
,
Lucy
,
would
remain
there
no
longer
.
<EOS>
There
were
but
two
objections
to
this
course
.
<EOS>
The
first
was
that
Frank
Greystock
was
not
her
lover
;
and
the
second
,
that
on
leaving
Fawn
Court
she
would
not
know
whither
to
betake
herself
.
<EOS>
It
was
understood
by
everybody
that
she
was
never
to
leave
Fawn
Court
till
an
unexceptionable
home
should
be
found
for
her
,
either
with
the
Hittaways
or
elsewhere
.
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
would
no
more
allow
her
to
go
away
,
depending
for
her
future
on
the
mere
chance
of
some
promiscuous
engagement
,
than
she
would
have
turned
one
of
her
own
daughters
out
of
the
house
in
the
same
forlorn
condition
.
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
was
a
tower
of
strength
to
Lucy
.
<EOS>
But
then
a
tower
of
strength
may
at
any
moment
become
a
dungeon
.
  
<EOS>
Frank
Greystock
was
not
her
lover
.
<EOS>
Ah
,
 
there
was
the
worst
of
it
all
!
<EOS>
She
had
given
her
heart
and
had
got
nothing
in
return
.
<EOS>
She
conned
it
all
over
in
her
own
mind
,
striving
to
ascertain
whether
there
was
any
real
cause
for
shame
to
her
in
her
own
conduct
.
<EOS>
Had
she
been
unmaidenly
?
<EOS>
Had
she
been
too
forward
with
her
heart
?
<EOS>
Had
it
been
extracted
from
her
,
as
women
's
hearts
are
extracted
,
by
efforts
on
the
man
's
part
;
or
had
she
simply
chucked
it
away
from
her
to
the
first
comer
?
<EOS>
Then
she
remembered
certain
scenes
at
the
deanery
,
words
that
had
been
spoken
,
looks
that
had
been
turned
upon
her
,
a
pressure
of
the
hand
late
at
night
,
a
little
whisper
,
a
ribbon
that
had
been
begged
,
a
flower
that
had
been
given
;
 
and
once
,
once
 
;
then
there
came
a
burning
blush
upon
her
cheek
that
there
should
have
been
so
much
,
and
yet
so
little
that
was
of
avail
.
<EOS>
She
had
no
right
to
say
to
any
one
that
the
man
was
her
lover
.
<EOS>
She
had
no
right
to
assure
herself
that
he
was
her
lover
.
<EOS>
But
she
knew
that
some
wrong
was
done
her
in
that
he
was
not
her
lover
.
  
<EOS>
Of
the
importance
of
her
own
self
as
a
living
thing
with
a
heart
to
suffer
and
a
soul
to
endure
,
she
thought
enough
.
<EOS>
She
believed
in
herself
,
thinking
of
herself
,
that
should
it
ever
be
her
lot
to
be
a
man
's
wife
<EOS>
,
she
would
be
to
him
a
true
,
loving
friend
and
companion
,
living
in
his
joys
,
and
fighting
,
if
it
were
necessary
,
down
to
the
stumps
of
her
nails
in
his
interests
.
<EOS>
But
of
what
she
had
to
give
over
and
above
her
heart
and
intellect
she
never
thought
at
all
.
<EOS>
Of
personal
beauty
she
had
very
little
appreciation
even
in
others
.
<EOS>
The
form
and
face
of
Lady
Eustace
,
which
indeed
were
very
lovely
,
were
distasteful
to
her
;
whereas
she
delighted
to
look
upon
the
broad
,
plain
,
colourless
countenance
of
Lydia
Fawn
,
who
was
endeared
to
her
by
frank
good
humour
and
an
unselfish
disposition
.
<EOS>
In
regard
to
men
she
had
never
asked
herself
the
question
whether
this
man
was
handsome
or
that
man
ugly
.
<EOS>
Of
Frank
Greystock
she
knew
that
his
face
was
full
of
quick
intellect
;
and
of
Lord
Fawn
she
knew
that
he
bore
no
outward
index
of
mind
.
<EOS>
One
man
she
not
only
loved
,
but
could
not
help
loving
;
the
other
man
,
as
regarded
that
sort
of
sympathy
which
marriage
should
recognise
,
must
always
have
been
worlds
asunder
from
her
.
<EOS>
She
knew
that
men
demand
that
women
shall
possess
beauty
,
and
she
certainly
had
never
thought
of
herself
as
beautiful
;
but
it
did
not
occur
to
her
that
on
that
account
she
was
doomed
to
fail
.
<EOS>
She
was
too
strong
-
hearted
for
any
such
fear
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
think
much
of
these
things
,
but
felt
herself
to
be
so
far
endowed
as
to
be
fit
to
be
the
wife
of
such
a
man
as
Frank
Greystock
.
<EOS>
She
was
a
proud
,
stout
,
self
-
confident
,
but
still
modest
little
woman
,
too
fond
of
truth
to
tell
lies
of
herself
even
to
herself
.
<EOS>
She
was
possessed
of
a
great
power
of
sympathy
,
genial
,
very
social
,
greatly
given
to
the
mirth
of
conversation
,
 
though
in
talking
she
would
listen
much
and
say
<EOS>
but
little
.
<EOS>
She
was
keenly
alive
to
humour
,
and
had
at
her
command
a
great
fund
of
laughter
,
which
would
illumine
her
whole
face
without
producing
a
sound
from
her
mouth
.
<EOS>
She
knew
herself
to
be
too
good
to
be
a
governess
for
life
;
 
and
yet
how
could
it
be
otherwise
with
her
?
  
<EOS>
Lady
Linlithgow
's
visit
to
her
niece
had
been
made
on
a
Thursday
,
and
on
that
same
evening
Frank
Greystock
had
asked
his
question
in
the
House
of
Commons
,
 
or
rather
had
made
his
speech
about
the
Sawab
of
Mygawb
.
<EOS>
We
all
know
the
meaning
of
such
speeches
.
<EOS>
Had
not
Frank
belonged
to
the
party
that
was
out
,
and
had
not
the
resistance
to
the
Sawab
's
claim
come
from
the
party
that
was
in
,
Frank
would
not
probably
have
cared
much
about
the
prince
.
<EOS>
We
may
be
sure
that
he
would
not
have
troubled
himself
to
read
a
line
of
that
very
dull
and
long
pamphlet
of
which
he
had
to
make
himself
master
before
he
could
venture
to
stir
in
the
matter
,
had
<EOS>
not
the
road
of
Opposition
been
open
to
him
in
that
direction
.
<EOS>
But
what
exertion
will
not
a
politician
make
with
the
view
of
getting
the
point
of
his
lance
within
the
joints
of
his
enemies
<EOS>
"
harness
?
<EOS>
Frank
made
his
speech
,
and
made
it
very
well
.
<EOS>
It
was
just
the
case
for
a
lawyer
,
admitting
that
kind
of
advocacy
which
it
is
a
lawyer
's
business
to
practise
.
<EOS>
The
Indian
minister
of
the
day
,
Lord
Fawn
's
chief
,
had
determined
,
after
much
anxious
consideration
,
that
it
was
his
duty
to
resist
the
claim
;
and
then
,
for
resisting
it
,
he
was
attacked
.
<EOS>
Had
he
yielded
to
the
claim
,
the
attack
would
have
been
as
venomous
,
and
very
probably
would
have
come
from
the
same
quarter
.
<EOS>
No
blame
by
such
an
assertion
is
cast
upon
the
young
Conservative
aspirant
for
party
honours
.
<EOS>
It
is
thus
the
war
is
waged
.
<EOS>
Frank
Greystock
took
up
the
Sawab
's
case
,
and
would
have
drawn
mingled
tears
and
indignation
from
his
hearers
,
had
not
his
hearers
all
known
the
conditions
of
the
contest
.
<EOS>
On
neither
side
did
the
hearers
care
much
for
the
Sawab
's
claims
,
but
they
felt
that
Greystock
was
making
good
his
own
claims
to
some
future
reward
from
his
party
.
<EOS>
He
was
very
hard
upon
the
minister
,
 
and
he
was
hard
also
upon
Lord
Fawn
,
stating
that
the
cruelty
of
Government
ascendancy
had
never
been
put
forward
as
a
doctrine
in
plainer
terms
than
those
which
had
been
used
in
"
another
place
"
in
reference
to
the
wrongs
of
this
poor
ill
-
used
native
chieftain
.
<EOS>
This
was
very
grievous
to
Lord
Fawn
,
who
had
personally
desired
to
favour
the
ill
-
used
chieftain
;
 
and
harder
again
because
he
and
Greystock
were
intimate
with
each
other
.
<EOS>
He
felt
the
thing
keenly
,
and
was
full
of
his
grievance
when
,
in
accordance
with
his
custom
,
he
came
down
to
Fawn
Court
on
the
Saturday
evening
.
  
<EOS>
The
Fawn
family
,
which
consisted
entirely
of
women
,
dined
early
.
<EOS>
On
Saturdays
,
when
his
lordship
would
come
down
,
a
dinner
was
prepared
for
him
alone
.
<EOS>
On
Sundays
they
all
dined
together
at
three
o'clock
.
<EOS>
On
Sunday
evening
Lord
Fawn
would
return
to
town
to
prepare
himself
for
his
Monday
's
work
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
,
also
,
he
disliked
the
sermon
which
Lady
Fawn
always
read
to
the
assembled
household
at
nine
o'clock
on
Sunday
evening
.
<EOS>
On
this
Saturday
he
came
out
into
the
grounds
after
dinner
,
where
the
oldest
unmarried
daughter
,
the
present
Miss
Fawn
,
was
walking
with
Lucy
Morris
.
<EOS>
It
was
almost
a
summer
evening
;
 
so
much
so
,
that
some
of
the
party
had
been
sitting
on
the
garden
benches
,
and
four
of
the
girls
were
still
playing
croquet
on
the
lawn
,
though
there
was
hardly
light
enough
to
see
the
balls
.
<EOS>
Miss
Fawn
had
already
told
Lucy
that
her
brother
was
very
angry
with
Mr.
Greystock
.
<EOS>
Now
,
Lucy
's
sympathies
were
all
with
Frank
and
the
Sawab
.
<EOS>
She
had
endeavoured
,
indeed
,
and
had
partially
succeeded
,
in
perverting
the
Under
-
Secretary
.
<EOS>
Nor
did
she
now
intend
to
change
her
opinions
,
although
all
the
Fawn
girls
,
and
Lady
Fawn
,
were
against
her
.
<EOS>
When
a
brother
or
a
son
is
an
Under
-
Secretary
of
State
,
sisters
and
mothers
will
constantly
be
on
the
side
of
the
Government
,
so
far
as
that
Under
-
Secretary
's
office
is
concerned
.
  
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
word
,
Frederic
,
"
said
Augusta
Fawn
,
"
I
do
think
Mr.
Greystock
was
too
bad
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
nothing
these
fellows
wo
n't
say
or
do
,
"
exclaimed
Lord
Fawn
.
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
understand
it
myself
.
<EOS>
When
I
've
been
in
opposition
,
I
never
did
that
kind
of
thing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
whether
it
was
because
he
is
angry
with
mamma
,
"
said
Miss
Fawn
.
<EOS>
Everybody
who
knew
the
Fawns
knew
that
Augusta
Fawn
was
not
clever
,
and
that
she
would
occasionally
say
the
very
thing
that
ought
not
to
be
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
dear
,
no
,
"
said
the
Under
-
Secretary
,
who
could
not
endure
the
idea
that
the
weak
women
-
kind
of
his
family
should
have
,
in
any
way
,
an
influence
on
the
august
doings
of
Parliament
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
mamma
did
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nothing
of
that
kind
at
all
,
"
said
his
lordship
,
putting
down
his
sister
with
great
authority
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Greystock
is
simply
not
an
honest
politician
.
<EOS>
That
is
about
the
whole
of
it
.
<EOS>
He
chose
to
attack
me
because
there
was
an
opportunity
.
<EOS>
There
is
n't
a
man
in
either
House
who
cares
for
such
things
,
personally
,
less
than
I
do
;
"
 
had
his
lordship
said
"
more
than
he
did
,
"
he
might
,
perhaps
,
have
been
correct
;
 
"
<EOS>
but
I
ca
n't
bear
the
feeling
.
<EOS>
The
fact
is
,
a
lawyer
never
understands
what
is
and
what
is
not
fair
fighting
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lucy
felt
her
face
tingling
with
heat
,
and
was
preparing
to
say
a
word
in
defence
of
that
special
lawyer
,
when
Lady
Fawn
's
voice
was
heard
from
the
drawing
-
room
window
.
<EOS>
"
Come
in
,
girls
.
<EOS>
It
's
nine
o'clock
.
<EOS>
"
In
that
house
Lady
Fawn
reigned
supreme
,
and
no
one
ever
doubted
,
for
a
moment
,
as
to
obedience
.
<EOS>
The
clicking
of
the
balls
ceased
,
and
those
who
were
walking
immediately
turned
their
faces
to
the
drawing
-
room
window
.
<EOS>
But
Lord
Fawn
,
who
was
not
one
of
the
girls
,
took
another
turn
by
himself
,
thinking
of
the
wrongs
he
had
endured
.
  
<EOS>
"
Frederic
is
so
angry
about
Mr.
Greystock
,
"
said
Augusta
,
as
soon
as
they
were
seated
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
feel
that
it
was
provoking
,
"
said
the
second
sister
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
considering
that
Mr.
Greystock
has
so
often
been
here
,
I
do
n't
think
it
was
kind
,
"
said
the
third
.
  
<EOS>
Lydia
did
not
speak
,
but
could
not
refrain
from
glancing
her
eyes
at
Lucy
's
face
.
<EOS>
"
I
believe
everything
is
considered
fair
in
Parliament
,
"
said
Lady
Fawn
.
  
<EOS>
Then
Lord
Fawn
,
who
had
heard
the
last
words
,
entered
through
the
window
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
about
that
,
mother
,
"
said
he
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Gentleman
-
like
conduct
is
the
same
everywhere
.
<EOS>
There
are
things
that
may
be
said
and
there
are
things
which
may
not
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Greystock
has
altogether
gone
beyond
the
usual
limits
,
and
I
shall
take
care
that
he
knows
my
opinion
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
not
going
to
quarrel
with
the
man
?
"
asked
the
mother
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
going
to
fight
him
,
if
you
mean
that
;
but
I
shall
let
him
know
that
I
think
that
he
has
transgressed
.
<EOS>
"
This
his
lordship
said
with
that
haughty
superiority
which
a
man
may
generally
display
with
safety
among
the
women
of
his
own
family
.
  
<EOS>
Lucy
had
borne
a
great
deal
,
knowing
well
that
it
was
better
that
she
should
bear
such
injury
in
silence
;
 
but
there
was
a
point
beyond
which
she
could
not
endure
it
.
<EOS>
It
was
intolerable
to
her
that
Mr.
Greystock
's
character
as
a
gentleman
should
be
impugned
before
all
the
ladies
of
the
family
,
every
one
of
whom
did
,
in
fact
,
know
her
liking
for
the
man
.
<EOS>
And
then
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
could
rush
into
the
battle
,
giving
a
side
blow
at
his
lordship
on
behalf
of
his
absent
antagonist
,
but
appearing
to
fight
for
the
Sawab
.
<EOS>
There
had
been
a
time
when
the
poor
Sawab
was
in
favour
at
Fawn
Court
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
Mr.
Greystock
was
right
to
say
all
he
could
for
the
prince
.
<EOS>
If
he
took
up
the
cause
,
he
was
bound
to
make
the
best
of
it
.
"
<EOS>
She
spoke
with
energy
and
with
a
heightened
colour
;
and
Lady
Fawn
,
hearing
her
,
shook
her
head
at
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Did
you
read
Mr.
Greystock
's
speech
,
Miss
Morris
?
"
asked
Lord
Fawn
.
  
<EOS>
"
Every
word
of
it
,
in
the
_
Times
_
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
understood
his
allusion
to
what
I
had
been
called
upon
to
say
in
the
House
of
Lords
on
behalf
of
the
Government
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
I
did
.
<EOS>
It
did
not
seem
to
be
difficult
to
understand
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
think
Mr.
Greystock
should
have
abstained
from
attacking
Frederic
,
"
said
Augusta
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
not
 
not
quite
the
thing
that
we
are
accustomed
to
,
"
said
Lord
Fawn
.
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
I
do
n't
know
about
that
,
"
said
Lucy
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
the
prince
is
being
used
very
ill
,
 
that
he
is
being
deprived
of
his
own
property
,
 
that
he
is
kept
out
of
his
rights
,
just
because
he
is
weak
,
and
I
am
very
glad
that
there
is
some
one
to
speak
up
for
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Lucy
,
"
said
Lady
Fawn
,
"
if
you
discuss
politics
with
Lord
Fawn
,
you
'll
get
the
worst
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
at
all
object
to
Miss
Morris
's
views
about
the
Sawab
,
"
said
the
Under
-
Secretary
generously
.
<EOS>
"
There
is
a
great
deal
to
be
said
on
both
sides
.
<EOS>
I
know
of
old
that
Miss
Morris
is
a
great
friend
of
the
Sawab
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
used
to
be
his
friend
too
,
"
said
Lucy
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
felt
for
him
,
 
and
do
feel
for
him
.
<EOS>
All
that
is
very
well
.
<EOS>
I
ask
no
one
to
agree
with
me
on
the
question
itself
.
<EOS>
I
only
say
that
Mr.
Greystock
's
mode
of
treating
it
was
unbecoming
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
was
the
very
best
speech
I
ever
read
in
my
life
,
"
said
Lucy
,
with
headlong
energy
and
heightened
colour
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
,
Miss
Morris
,
you
and
I
have
very
different
opinions
about
speeches
,
"
said
Lord
Fawn
,
with
severity
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
,
probably
,
never
read
Burke
's
speeches
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
do
n't
want
to
read
them
,
"
said
Lucy
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
another
question
,
"
said
Lord
Fawn
;
and
his
tone
and
manner
were
very
severe
indeed
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
are
talking
about
speeches
in
Parliament
,
"
said
Lucy
.
<EOS>
Poor
Lucy
!
<EOS>
She
knew
quite
as
well
as
did
Lord
Fawn
that
Burke
had
been
a
House
of
Commons
orator
;
but
in
her
impatience
,
and
from
absence
of
the
habit
of
argument
,
she
omitted
to
explain
that
she
was
talking
about
the
speeches
of
the
day
.
  
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
held
up
his
hands
,
and
put
his
head
a
little
on
one
side
.
"
<EOS>
My
dear
Lucy
,
"
said
Lady
Fawn
,
"
you
are
showing
your
ignorance
.
<EOS>
Where
do
you
suppose
that
Mr.
Burke
's
speeches
were
made
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
I
know
they
were
made
in
Parliament
,
"
said
Lucy
,
almost
in
tears
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
Miss
Morris
means
that
Burke
's
greatest
efforts
were
not
made
in
Parliament
,
 
that
his
speech
to
the
electors
of
Bristol
,
for
instance
,
and
his
opening
address
on
the
trial
of
Warren
Hastings
,
were
,
upon
the
whole
,
superior
to
 
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
mean
anything
at
all
,
"
said
Lucy
.
  
<EOS>
"
Lord
Fawn
is
trying
to
help
you
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Lady
Fawn
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
want
to
be
helped
,
"
said
Lucy
.
<EOS>
"
I
only
mean
that
I
thought
Mr.
Greystock
's
speech
as
good
as
it
could
possibly
be
.
<EOS>
There
was
n't
a
word
in
it
that
did
n't
seem
to
me
to
be
just
what
it
ought
to
be
.
<EOS>
I
do
think
that
they
are
ill
-
treating
that
poor
Indian
prince
,
and
I
am
very
glad
that
somebody
has
had
the
courage
to
get
up
and
say
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
No
doubt
it
would
have
been
better
that
Lucy
should
have
held
her
tongue
.
<EOS>
Had
she
simply
been
upholding
against
an
opponent
a
political
speaker
whose
speech
she
had
read
with
pleasure
,
she
might
have
held
her
own
in
the
argument
against
the
whole
Fawn
family
.
<EOS>
She
was
a
favourite
with
them
all
,
and
even
the
Under
-
Secretary
would
not
have
been
hard
upon
her
.
<EOS>
But
there
had
been
more
than
this
for
poor
Lucy
to
do
.
<EOS>
Her
heart
was
so
truly
concerned
in
the
matter
,
that
she
could
not
refrain
herself
from
resenting
an
attack
on
the
man
she
loved
.
<EOS>
She
had
allowed
herself
to
be
carried
into
superlatives
,
and
had
almost
been
uncourteous
to
Lord
Fawn
.
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
"
said
Lady
Fawn
,
"
we
wo
n't
say
anything
more
upon
the
subject
.
"
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
took
up
a
book
.
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
busied
herself
in
her
knitting
.
<EOS>
Lydia
assumed
a
look
of
unhappiness
,
as
though
something
very
sad
had
occurred
.
<EOS>
Augusta
addressed
a
question
to
her
brother
in
a
tone
which
plainly
indicated
a
feeling
on
her
part
that
her
brother
had
been
ill
-
used
and
was
entitled
to
special
consideration
.
<EOS>
Lucy
sat
silent
and
still
,
and
then
left
the
room
with
a
hurried
step
.
<EOS>
Lydia
at
once
rose
to
follow
her
,
but
was
stopped
by
her
mother
.
<EOS>
"
You
had
better
leave
her
alone
just
at
present
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Lady
Fawn
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
not
know
that
Miss
Morris
was
so
particularly
interested
in
Mr.
Greystock
,
"
said
Lord
Fawn
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
has
known
him
since
she
was
a
child
,
"
said
his
mother
.
  
<EOS>
About
an
hour
afterwards
Lady
Fawn
went
up
-
stairs
and
found
Lucy
sitting
all
alone
in
the
still
so
-
called
school
-
room
.
<EOS>
She
had
no
candle
,
and
had
made
no
pretence
to
do
anything
since
she
had
left
the
room
down
-
stairs
.
<EOS>
In
the
interval
family
prayers
had
been
read
,
and
Lucy
's
absence
was
unusual
and
contrary
to
rule
.
<EOS>
"
Lucy
,
my
dear
,
why
are
you
sitting
here
?
"
said
Lady
Fawn
.
  
<EOS>
"
Because
I
am
unhappy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
makes
you
unhappy
,
Lucy
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
.
<EOS>
I
would
rather
you
did
n't
ask
me
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
I
behaved
badly
down
-
stairs
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
son
would
forgive
you
in
a
moment
if
you
asked
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
 
certainly
not
.
<EOS>
I
can
beg
your
pardon
,
Lady
Fawn
,
but
not
his
.
<EOS>
Of
course
I
had
no
right
to
talk
about
speeches
,
and
politics
,
and
this
prince
in
your
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Lucy
,
you
astonish
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
it
is
so
.
<EOS>
Dear
Lady
Fawn
,
do
n't
look
like
that
.
<EOS>
I
know
how
good
you
are
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
know
you
let
me
do
things
which
other
governesses
may
n't
do
;
 
and
say
things
;
but
still
I
am
a
governess
,
and
<EOS>
I
know
I
misbehaved
 
to
you
.
"
<EOS>
Then
Lucy
burst
into
tears
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
,
in
whose
bosom
there
was
no
stony
corner
or
morsel
of
hard
iron
,
was
softened
at
once
.
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
you
are
more
like
another
daughter
to
me
than
anything
else
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
Lady
Fawn
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
it
makes
me
unhappy
when
I
see
your
mind
engaged
about
Mr.
Greystock
.
<EOS>
There
is
the
truth
,
Lucy
.
<EOS>
You
should
not
think
of
Mr.
Greystock
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Greystock
is
a
man
who
has
his
way
to
make
in
the
world
,
and
could
not
marry
you
,
even
if
,
under
other
circumstances
,
he
would
wish
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
You
know
how
frank
I
am
with
you
,
giving
you
credit
for
honest
,
sound
good
sense
.
<EOS>
To
me
and
to
my
girls
,
who
know
you
as
a
lady
,
you
are
as
dear
a
friend
as
though
you
were
 
were
anything
you
may
please
to
think
.
<EOS>
Lucy
Morris
is
to
us
our
own
dear
,
dear
little
friend
Lucy
.
<EOS>
But
Mr.
Greystock
,
who
is
a
Member
of
Parliament
,
could
not
marry
a
governess
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
love
him
so
dearly
,
"
said
Lucy
,
getting
up
from
her
chair
,
"
that
his
slightest
word
is
to
me
more
than
all
the
words
of
all
the
world
beside
!
<EOS>
It
is
no
use
,
Lady
Fawn
.
<EOS>
I
do
love
him
,
and
I
do
n't
mean
to
try
to
give
it
up
!
"
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
stood
silent
for
a
moment
,
and
then
suggested
that
it
would
be
better
for
them
both
to
go
to
bed
.
<EOS>
During
that
minute
she
had
been
unable
to
decide
what
she
had
better
say
or
do
in
the
present
emergency
.
   
<EOS>
The
Conquering
Hero
Comes
 
<EOS>
The
reader
will
perhaps
remember
that
when
Lizzie
Eustace
was
told
that
her
aunt
was
down
-
stairs
<EOS>
Frank
Greystock
was
with
her
,
and
that
he
promised
to
return
on
the
following
day
to
hear
the
result
of
the
interview
.
<EOS>
Had
Lady
Linlithgow
not
come
at
that
very
moment
<EOS>
Frank
would
probably
have
asked
his
rich
cousin
to
be
his
wife
.
<EOS>
She
had
told
him
that
she
was
solitary
and
unhappy
;
and
after
that
what
else
could
he
have
done
but
ask
her
to
be
his
wife
?
<EOS>
The
old
countess
,
however
,
arrived
,
and
interrupted
him
.
<EOS>
He
went
away
abruptly
,
promising
to
come
on
the
morrow
;
 
but
on
the
morrow
he
never
came
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
Friday
,
and
Lizzie
remained
at
home
for
him
the
whole
morning
.
<EOS>
When
four
o'clock
was
passed
she
knew
that
he
would
be
at
the
House
.
<EOS>
But
still
she
did
not
stir
.
<EOS>
And
she
contrived
that
Miss
Macnulty
should
be
absent
the
entire
day
.
<EOS>
Miss
Macnulty
was
even
made
to
go
to
the
play
by
herself
in
the
evening
.
<EOS>
But
her
absence
was
of
no
service
.
<EOS>
Frank
Greystock
came
not
;
and
at
eleven
at
night
Lizzie
swore
to
herself
that
should
he
ever
come
again
,
he
should
come
in
vain
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
through
the
whole
of
Saturday
she
expected
him
with
more
or
less
of
confidence
,
and
on
the
Sunday
morning
she
was
still
well
-
inclined
towards
him
.
<EOS>
It
might
be
that
he
would
come
on
that
day
.
<EOS>
She
could
understand
that
a
man
with
his
hands
so
full
of
business
,
as
were
those
of
her
cousin
Frank
,
should
find
himself
unable
to
keep
an
appointment
.
<EOS>
Nor
would
there
be
fair
ground
for
permanent
anger
with
such
a
one
,
even
should
he
forget
an
appointment
.
<EOS>
But
surely
he
would
come
on
the
Sunday
!
<EOS>
She
had
been
quite
sure
that
the
offer
was
about
to
be
made
when
that
odious
old
harridan
had
come
in
and
disturbed
everything
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
the
offer
had
been
all
but
made
.
<EOS>
She
had
felt
the
premonitory
flutter
,
had
asked
herself
the
important
question
,
 
and
had
answered
it
.
<EOS>
She
had
told
herself
that
the
thing
would
do
.
<EOS>
Frank
was
not
the
exact
hero
that
her
fancy
had
painted
,
 
but
he
was
sufficiently
heroic
.
<EOS>
Everybody
said
that
he
would
work
his
way
up
to
the
top
of
the
tree
,
and
become
a
rich
man
.
<EOS>
At
any
rate
she
had
resolved
;
 
and
then
Lady
Linlithgow
had
come
in
!
<EOS>
Surely
he
would
come
on
the
Sunday
.
  
<EOS>
He
did
not
come
on
the
Sunday
,
but
Lord
Fawn
did
come
.
<EOS>
Immediately
after
morning
church
Lord
Fawn
declared
his
intention
of
returning
at
once
from
Fawn
Court
to
town
.
<EOS>
He
was
very
silent
at
breakfast
,
and
his
sisters
surmised
that
he
was
still
angry
with
poor
Lucy
.
<EOS>
Lucy
,
too
,
was
unlike
herself
,
 
was
silent
,
sad
,
and
oppressed
.
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
was
serious
,
and
almost
solemn
;
 
so
that
there
was
little
even
of
holy
mirth
at
Fawn
Court
on
that
Sunday
morning
.
<EOS>
The
whole
family
,
however
,
went
to
church
,
and
immediately
on
their
return
Lord
Fawn
expressed
his
intention
of
returning
to
town
.
<EOS>
All
the
sisters
felt
that
an
injury
had
been
done
to
them
by
Lucy
.
<EOS>
It
was
only
on
Sundays
that
their
dinner
-
table
was
graced
by
the
male
member
of
the
family
,
and
now
he
was
driven
away
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
that
you
are
going
to
desert
us
,
Frederic
,
"
said
Lady
Fawn
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
muttered
something
as
to
absolute
necessity
,
and
went
.
<EOS>
The
afternoon
was
very
dreary
at
Fawn
Court
.
<EOS>
Nothing
was
said
on
the
subject
;
but
there
was
still
the
feeling
that
Lucy
had
offended
.
<EOS>
At
four
o'clock
on
that
Sunday
afternoon
Lord
Fawn
was
closeted
with
Lady
Eustace
.
  
<EOS>
The
"
closeting
"
consisted
simply
in
the
fact
that
Miss
Macnulty
was
not
present
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
fully
appreciated
the
pleasure
,
and
utility
,
and
general
convenience
of
having
a
companion
,
but
she
had
no
scruple
<EOS>
whatever
in
obtaining
absolute
freedom
for
herself
when
she
desired
it
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
,
"
she
would
say
,
"
the
best
friends
in
the
world
should
n't
always
be
together
;
should
they
?
<EOS>
Would
n't
you
like
to
go
to
the
Horticultural
?
"
<EOS>
Then
Miss
Macnulty
would
go
to
the
Horticultural
,
 
or
else
up
into
her
own
bed
-
room
.
<EOS>
When
Lizzie
was
beginning
to
wax
wrathful
again
because
Frank
Greystock
did
not
come
,
Lord
Fawn
made
his
appearance
.
<EOS>
"
How
kind
this
is
,
"
said
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
"
I
thought
you
were
always
at
Richmond
on
Sundays
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
just
come
up
from
my
mother
's
,
"
said
Lord
Fawn
,
twiddling
his
hat
.
<EOS>
Then
Lizzie
,
with
a
pretty
eagerness
,
asked
after
Lady
Fawn
and
the
girls
,
and
her
dear
little
friend
Lucy
Morris
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
could
be
very
prettily
eager
when
she
pleased
.
<EOS>
She
leaned
forward
her
face
as
she
asked
her
questions
,
and
threw
back
her
loose
lustrous
lock
of
hair
,
with
her
long
lithe
fingers
covered
with
diamonds
,
 
the
diamonds
,
these
,
which
Sir
Florian
had
really
given
her
,
or
which
she
had
procured
from
Mr.
Benjamin
in
the
clever
manner
described
in
the
opening
chapter
.
<EOS>
"
They
are
,
all
quite
well
,
thank
you
,
"
said
Lord
Fawn
.
<EOS>
"
I
believe
Miss
Morris
is
quite
well
,
though
she
was
a
little
out
of
sorts
last
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
is
not
ill
,
I
hope
,
"
said
Lizzie
,
bringing
the
lustrous
lock
forward
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
In
her
temper
,
I
mean
,
"
said
Lord
Fawn
.
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
!
<EOS>
I
hope
Miss
Lucy
is
not
forgetting
herself
.
<EOS>
That
would
be
very
sad
,
after
the
great
kindness
she
has
received
.
"
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
said
that
it
would
be
very
sad
,
and
then
put
his
hat
down
upon
the
floor
.
<EOS>
It
came
upon
Lizzie
at
that
moment
,
as
by
a
flash
of
lightning
,
 
by
an
electric
message
delivered
to
her
intellect
by
that
movement
of
the
hat
,
 
that
she
might
be
sure
of
Lord
Fawn
if
she
chose
to
take
him
.
<EOS>
On
Friday
she
might
have
been
sure
of
Frank
,
 
only
that
Lady
Linlithgow
came
in
the
way
.
<EOS>
But
now
she
did
not
feel
at
all
sure
of
Frank
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
was
at
any
rate
a
peer
.
<EOS>
She
had
heard
that
he
was
a
poor
peer
,
 
but
a
peer
<EOS>
,
she
thought
,
ca
n't
be
altogether
poor
.
<EOS>
And
though
he
was
a
stupid
owl
,
 
she
did
not
hesitate
to
acknowledge
to
herself
that
he
was
as
stupid
as
an
owl
,
 
he
had
a
position
.
<EOS>
He
was
one
of
the
Government
,
and
his
wife
would
,
no
doubt
,
be
able
to
go
anywhere
.
<EOS>
It
was
becoming
essential
to
her
that
she
should
marry
.
<EOS>
Even
though
her
husband
should
give
up
the
diamonds
,
she
would
not
in
such
case
incur
the
disgrace
of
surrendering
them
herself
.
<EOS>
She
would
have
kept
them
till
she
had
ceased
to
be
a
Eustace
.
<EOS>
Frank
had
certainly
meant
it
on
that
Thursday
afternoon
;
 
but
surely
he
would
have
been
in
Mount
Street
before
this
if
he
had
not
changed
his
mind
.
<EOS>
We
all
know
that
a
bird
in
the
hand
is
worth
two
in
the
bush
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
at
Fawn
Court
once
or
twice
,
"
said
Lizzie
,
with
her
sweetest
grace
,
"
and
I
always
think
it
a
model
of
real
family
happiness
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
may
be
there
very
often
,
"
said
Lord
Fawn
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
I
have
no
right
to
intrude
myself
often
on
your
mother
,
Lord
Fawn
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
could
hardly
be
a
better
opening
than
this
for
him
<EOS>
had
he
chosen
to
accept
it
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
not
thus
that
he
had
arranged
it
,
 
for
he
had
made
his
arrangements
.
<EOS>
"
There
would
be
no
feeling
of
that
kind
,
I
am
sure
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
And
then
he
was
silent
.
<EOS>
How
was
he
to
deploy
himself
on
the
ground
before
him
so
as
to
make
the
strategy
which
he
had
prepared
answer
the
occasion
of
the
day
?
"
<EOS>
Lady
Eustace
,
"
he
said
,
"
I
do
n't
know
what
your
views
of
life
may
be
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
a
child
,
you
know
,
to
bring
up
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
yes
;
 
that
gives
a
great
interest
,
of
course
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
will
inherit
a
very
large
fortune
,
Lord
Fawn
;
 
too
large
,
I
fear
,
to
be
of
service
to
a
youth
of
one
-
and
-
twenty
;
and
I
must
endeavour
to
fit
him
for
the
possession
of
it
.
<EOS>
That
is
,
 
and
always
must
be
,
the
chief
object
of
my
existence
.
"
<EOS>
Then
she
felt
that
she
had
said
too
much
.
<EOS>
He
was
just
the
man
who
would
be
fool
enough
to
believe
her
.
"
<EOS>
Not
but
what
it
is
hard
to
do
it
.
<EOS>
A
mother
can
of
course
devote
herself
to
her
child
;
 
but
when
a
portion
of
the
devotion
must
be
given
to
the
preservation
of
material
interests
there
is
less
of
tenderness
in
it
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
think
so
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
No
doubt
,
"
said
Lord
Fawn
;
 
"
no
doubt
.
<EOS>
"
But
he
had
not
followed
her
,
and
was
still
thinking
of
his
own
strategy
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
comfort
,
of
course
,
to
know
that
one
's
child
is
provided
for
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
yes
;
 
but
they
tell
me
the
poor
little
dear
will
have
forty
thousand
a
year
when
he
's
of
age
;
and
when
I
look
at
him
in
his
little
bed
,
and
press
him
in
my
arms
,
and
think
of
all
that
money
,
I
almost
wish
that
his
father
had
been
a
poor
plain
gentleman
.
"
<EOS>
Then
the
handkerchief
was
put
to
her
eyes
,
and
Lord
Fawn
had
a
moment
in
which
to
collect
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
 
<EOS>
I
myself
am
a
poor
man
;
 
for
my
rank
I
mean
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
man
with
your
position
,
Lord
Fawn
,
and
your
talents
and
genius
for
business
,
can
never
be
poor
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
father
's
property
was
all
Irish
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Was
it
indeed
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
he
was
an
Irish
peer
,
till
Lord
Melbourne
gave
him
an
English
peerage
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
An
Irish
peer
,
was
he
?
"
<EOS>
Lizzie
understood
nothing
of
this
,
but
presumed
that
an
Irish
peer
was
a
peer
who
had
not
sufficient
money
to
live
upon
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
,
however
,
was
endeavouring
to
describe
his
own
history
in
as
few
words
as
possible
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
was
then
made
Lord
Fawn
of
Richmond
,
in
the
peerage
of
the
United
Kingdom
.
<EOS>
Fawn
Court
,
you
know
,
belonged
to
my
mother
's
father
before
my
mother
's
marriage
.
<EOS>
The
property
in
Ireland
is
still
mine
,
but
there
's
no
place
on
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Indeed
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
was
a
house
,
but
my
father
allowed
it
to
tumble
down
.
<EOS>
It
's
in
Tipperary
;
 
not
at
all
a
desirable
country
to
live
in
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
dear
,
no
!
<EOS>
Do
n't
they
murder
the
people
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
about
five
thousand
a
year
,
and
out
of
that
my
mother
has
half
for
her
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
an
excellent
family
arrangement
,
"
said
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
There
was
so
long
a
pause
made
between
each
statement
that
she
was
forced
to
make
some
reply
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
for
a
peer
,
the
fortune
is
very
small
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
then
you
have
a
salary
;
 
do
n't
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
At
present
I
have
;
 
but
no
one
can
tell
how
long
that
may
last
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
sure
it
's
for
everybody
's
good
that
it
should
go
on
for
ever
so
many
years
,
"
said
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
"
said
Lord
Fawn
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
afraid
,
however
,
there
are
a
great
many
people
who
do
n't
think
so
.
<EOS>
Your
cousin
Greystock
would
do
anything
on
earth
to
turn
us
out
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Luckily
,
my
cousin
Frank
has
not
much
power
,
"
said
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
And
in
saying
it
she
threw
into
her
tone
,
and
into
her
countenance
,
a
certain
amount
of
contempt
for
Frank
as
a
man
and
as
a
politician
,
which
was
pleasant
to
Lord
Fawn
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
"
said
he
,
"
I
have
told
you
everything
about
myself
which
I
was
bound
,
as
a
man
of
honour
,
to
tell
before
 
I
 
<EOS>
I
 
<EOS>
I
 
.
<EOS>
In
short
you
know
what
I
mean

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Lord
Fawn
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
told
you
everything
.
<EOS>
I
owe
no
money
,
but
I
could
not
afford
to
marry
a
wife
without
an
income
.
<EOS>
I
admire
you
more
than
any
woman
I
ever
saw
.
<EOS>
I
love
you
with
all
my
heart
.
"
<EOS>
He
was
now
standing
upright
before
her
,
with
the
fingers
of
his
right
hand
touching
his
left
breast
,
and
there
was
something
almost
of
dignity
in
his
gesture
and
demeanour
.
<EOS>
"
It
may
be
that
you
are
determined
never
to
marry
again
.
<EOS>
I
can
only
say
that
if
you
will
trust
yourself
to
me
,
 
yourself
and
your
child
,
 
I
will
do
my
duty
truly
by
you
both
,
and
will
make
your
happiness
the
chief
object
of
my
existence
.
<EOS>
"
When
she
had
listened
to
him
thus
far
,
of
course
she
must
accept
him
;
but
he
was
by
no
means
aware
of
that
.
<EOS>
She
sat
silent
,
with
her
hands
folded
on
her
breast
,
looking
down
upon
the
ground
;
but
he
did
not
as
yet
attempt
to
seat
himself
by
her
.
"
<EOS>
Lady
Eustace
,
"
he
continued
,
"
may
I
venture
to
entertain
a
hope
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
May
I
not
have
an
hour
to
think
of
it
?
"
said
Lizzie
,
just
venturing
to
turn
a
glance
of
her
eye
upon
his
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
certainly
.
<EOS>
I
will
call
again
whenever
you
may
bid
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Now
she
was
silent
for
two
or
three
minutes
,
during
which
he
still
stood
over
her
.
<EOS>
But
he
had
dropped
his
hand
from
his
breast
,
and
had
stooped
,
and
picked
up
his
hat
ready
for
his
departure
.
<EOS>
Was
he
to
come
again
on
Monday
,
or
Tuesday
,
or
Wednesday
?
<EOS>
Let
her
tell
him
that
<EOS>
and
he
would
go
.
<EOS>
He
doubtless
reflected
that
Wednesday
would
suit
him
best
,
because
there
would
be
no
House
.
<EOS>
But
Lizzie
was
too
magnanimous
for
this
.
"
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
,
"
she
said
,
rising
,
"
you
have
paid
me
the
greatest
compliment
that
a
man
can
pay
a
woman
.
<EOS>
Coming
from
you
it
is
doubly
precious
;
first
,
because
of
your
character
;
and
secondly
 
"
  
"
Why
secondly
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Secondly
,
because
I
can
love
you
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
This
was
said
in
her
lowest
whisper
,
and
then
she
moved
towards
him
gently
,
and
almost
laid
her
head
upon
his
breast
.
<EOS>
Of
course
he
put
his
arm
round
her
waist
,
 
but
it
was
first
necessary
that
he
should
once
more
disembarrass
himself
of
his
hat
,
 
and
then
her
head
was
upon
his
breast
.
"
<EOS>
Dearest
Lizzie
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dearest
Frederic
!
"
<EOS>
she
murmured
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
write
to
my
mother
to
-
night
,
"
he
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
,
do
;
 
dear
Frederic
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
she
will
come
to
you
at
once
,
I
am
sure
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
will
receive
her
and
love
her
as
a
mother
,
"
said
Lizzie
,
with
all
her
energy
.
<EOS>
Then
he
kissed
her
again
,
 
her
forehead
and
her
lips
,
 
and
took
his
leave
,
promising
to
be
with
her
at
any
rate
on
Wednesday
.
  
<EOS>
"
Lady
Fawn
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
to
herself
.
<EOS>
The
name
did
not
sound
so
well
as
that
of
Lady
Eustace
.
<EOS>
But
it
is
much
to
be
a
wife
;
and
more
to
be
a
peeress
.
   
<EOS>
Showing
What
the
Miss
Fawns
Said
,
and
What
Mrs.
Hittaway
Thought
 
<EOS>
In
the
way
of
duty
Lord
Fawn
was
a
Hercules
,
 
not
,
indeed
,
"
climbing
trees
in
the
Hesperides
,
"
but
achieving
enterprises
which
,
to
other
men
,
if
not
impossible
,
would
have
been
so
unpalatable
as
to
have
been
put
aside
as
impracticable
.
<EOS>
On
the
Monday
morning
,
after
he
was
accepted
by
Lady
Eustace
,
he
was
with
his
mother
at
Fawn
Court
before
he
went
down
to
the
India
Office
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
at
least
been
very
honest
in
the
description
he
had
given
of
his
own
circumstances
to
the
lady
whom
he
intended
to
marry
.
<EOS>
He
had
told
her
the
exact
truth
;
and
though
she
,
with
all
her
cleverness
,
had
not
been
able
to
realise
the
facts
when
related
to
her
so
suddenly
,
still
enough
had
been
said
to
make
it
quite
clear
that
,
when
details
of
business
should
hereafter
be
discussed
in
a
less
hurried
manner
,
he
would
be
able
to
say
that
he
had
explained
all
his
circumstances
before
he
had
made
his
offer
.
<EOS>
And
he
had
been
careful
,
too
,
as
to
her
affairs
.
<EOS>
He
had
ascertained
that
her
late
husband
had
certainly
settled
upon
her
for
life
<EOS>
an
estate
worth
four
thousand
a
year
.
<EOS>
He
knew
,
also
,
that
eight
thousand
pounds
had
been
left
her
,
but
of
that
he
took
no
account
.
<EOS>
It
might
be
probable
that
she
had
spent
it
.
<EOS>
If
any
of
it
were
left
,
it
would
be
a
godsend
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
thought
a
great
deal
about
money
.
<EOS>
Being
a
poor
man
,
filling
a
place
fit
only
for
rich
men
,
he
had
been
driven
to
think
of
money
,
and
had
become
self
-
denying
and
parsimonious
,
 
<EOS>
perhaps
we
may
say
hungry
and
close
-
fisted
.
<EOS>
Such
a
condition
of
character
is
the
natural
consequence
of
such
a
position
.
<EOS>
There
is
,
probably
,
no
man
who
becomes
naturally
so
hard
in
regard
to
money
as
he
who
is
bound
to
live
among
rich
men
,
who
is
not
rich
himself
,
and
who
is
yet
honest
.
<EOS>
The
weight
of
the
work
of
life
in
these
circumstances
is
so
crushing
,
requires
such
continued
thought
,
and
makes
itself
so
continually
felt
,
that
the
mind
of
the
sufferer
is
never
free
from
the
contamination
of
sixpences
.
<EOS>
Of
such
a
one
it
is
not
fair
to
judge
as
of
other
men
with
similar
incomes
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
had
declared
to
his
future
bride
that
he
had
half
five
thousand
a
year
to
spend
,
 
or
the
half
,
rather
,
of
such
actual
income
as
might
be
got
in
from
an
estate
presumed
to
give
five
thousand
a
year
,
 
and
it
may
be
said
that
an
unmarried
gentleman
ought
not
to
be
poor
with
such
an
income
.
<EOS>
But
Lord
Fawn
unfortunately
was
a
lord
,
unfortunately
was
a
landlord
,
unfortunately
was
an
Irish
landlord
.
<EOS>
Let
him
be
as
careful
as
he
might
with
his
sixpences
,
his
pounds
would
fly
from
him
,
or
,
as
might
,
perhaps
,
be
better
said
,
could
not
be
made
to
fly
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
was
very
careful
with
his
sixpences
,
and
was
always
thinking
,
not
exactly
how
he
might
make
two
ends
meet
,
but
how
to
reconcile
the
strictest
personal
economy
with
the
proper
bearing
of
an
English
nobleman
.
  
<EOS>
Such
a
man
almost
naturally
looks
to
marriage
as
an
assistance
in
the
dreary
fight
.
<EOS>
It
soon
becomes
clear
to
him
that
he
can
not
marry
without
money
,
and
he
learns
to
think
that
heiresses
have
been
invented
exactly
to
suit
his
case
.
<EOS>
He
is
conscious
of
having
been
subjected
to
hardship
by
Fortune
,
and
regards
female
wealth
as
his
legitimate
mode
of
escape
from
it
.
<EOS>
He
has
got
himself
,
his
position
,
and
,
perhaps
,
his
title
to
dispose
of
,
and
they
are
surely
worth
so
much
per
annum
.
<EOS>
As
for
giving
anything
away
,
that
is
out
of
the
question
.
<EOS>
He
has
not
been
so
placed
as
to
be
able
to
give
.
<EOS>
But
,
being
an
honest
man
,
he
will
,
if
possible
,
make
a
fair
bargain
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
was
certainly
an
honest
man
,
and
he
had
been
endeavouring
for
the
last
six
or
seven
years
to
make
a
fair
bargain
.
<EOS>
But
then
it
is
so
hard
to
decide
what
is
fair
.
<EOS>
Who
is
to
tell
a
Lord
Fawn
how
much
per
annum
he
ought
to
regard
himself
as
worth
?
<EOS>
He
had
,
on
one
or
two
occasions
,
asked
a
high
price
,
but
no
previous
bargain
had
been
made
.
<EOS>
No
doubt
he
had
come
down
a
little
in
his
demand
in
suggesting
a
matrimonial
arrangement
to
a
widow
with
a
child
,
and
with
only
four
thousand
a
year
.
<EOS>
Whether
or
no
that
income
was
hers
in
perpetuity
,
or
only
for
life
,
he
had
not
positively
known
when
he
made
his
offer
.
<EOS>
The
will
made
by
Sir
Florian
Eustace
did
not
refer
to
the
property
at
all
.
<EOS>
In
the
natural
course
of
things
,
the
widow
would
only
have
a
life
-
interest
in
the
income
.
<EOS>
Why
should
Sir
Florian
make
away
,
in
perpetuity
,
with
his
family
property
?
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
there
had
been
a
rumour
abroad
that
Sir
Florian
had
been
very
generous
;
that
the
Scotch
estate
was
to
go
to
a
second
son
in
the
event
of
there
being
a
second
son
;
 
but
that
otherwise
it
was
to
be
at
the
widow
's
own
disposal
.
<EOS>
No
doubt
,
had
Lord
Fawn
been
persistent
,
he
might
have
found
out
the
exact
truth
.
<EOS>
He
had
,
however
,
calculated
that
he
could
afford
to
accept
even
the
life
-
income
.
<EOS>
If
more
should
come
of
it
,
so
much
the
better
for
him
.
<EOS>
He
might
,
at
any
rate
,
so
arrange
the
family
matters
,
that
his
heir
,
should
he
have
one
,
should
not
at
his
death
be
called
upon
to
pay
something
more
than
half
the
proceeds
of
the
family
property
to
his
mother
,
 
as
was
now
done
by
himself
.
  
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
breakfasted
at
Fawn
Court
on
the
Monday
,
and
his
mother
sat
at
the
table
with
him
,
pouring
out
his
tea
.
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Frederic
<EOS>
,
"
she
said
,
"
it
is
so
important
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Just
so
;
 
very
important
indeed
.
<EOS>
I
should
like
you
to
call
and
see
her
either
to
-
day
or
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
of
course
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
had
better
get
her
down
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
that
she
'll
come
.
<EOS>
Ought
I
to
ask
the
little
boy
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Certainly
,
"
said
Lord
Fawn
,
as
he
put
a
spoonful
of
egg
into
his
mouth
;
"
certainly
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
Miss
Macnulty
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
I
do
n't
see
that
at
all
.
<EOS>
I
'm
not
going
to
marry
Miss
Macnulty
.
<EOS>
The
child
,
of
course
,
must
be
one
of
us
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
is
the
income
,
Frederic
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Four
thousand
a
year
.
<EOS>
Something
more
,
nominally
,
but
four
thousand
to
spend
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
sure
about
that
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Quite
sure
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
for
ever
?
"
  
"
I
believe
so
.
<EOS>
Of
that
I
am
not
sure
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
makes
a
great
difference
,
Frederic
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
very
great
difference
indeed
.
<EOS>
I
think
it
is
her
own
.
<EOS>
But
,
at
any
rate
,
she
is
much
younger
than
I
am
,
and
there
need
be
no
settlement
out
of
my
property
.
<EOS>
That
is
the
great
thing
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
think
she
's
 
nice
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
is
very
lovely
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
clever
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Certainly
very
clever
.
<EOS>
I
hope
she
is
not
self
-
willed
,
Frederic
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
she
is
,
we
must
try
and
balance
it
,
"
said
Lord
Fawn
,
with
a
little
smile
.
<EOS>
But
,
in
truth
,
he
had
thought
nothing
about
any
such
quality
as
that
to
which
his
mother
now
referred
.
<EOS>
The
lady
had
an
income
.
<EOS>
That
was
the
first
and
most
indispensable
consideration
.
<EOS>
She
was
fairly
well
-
born
,
was
a
lady
,
and
was
beautiful
.
<EOS>
In
doing
Lord
Fawn
justice
,
we
must
allow
that
,
in
all
his
attempted
matrimonial
speculations
,
some
amount
of
feminine
loveliness
had
been
combined
with
feminine
wealth
.
<EOS>
He
had
for
two
years
been
a
suitor
of
Violet
Effingham
,
who
was
the
acknowledged
beauty
of
the
day
,
 
of
Violet
Effingham
who
,
at
the
present
time
,
was
the
wife
of
Lord
Chiltern
;
and
he
had
offered
himself
thrice
to
Madame
Max
Goesler
,
who
was
reputed
to
be
as
rich
as
she
was
beautiful
.
<EOS>
In
either
case
,
the
fortune
would
have
been
greater
than
that
which
he
would
now
win
,
and
the
money
would
certainly
have
been
for
ever
.
<EOS>
But
in
these
attempts
he
had
failed
;
and
Lord
Fawn
was
not
a
man
to
think
himself
ill
-
used
because
he
did
not
get
the
first
good
thing
for
which
he
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
I
may
tell
the
girls
?
"
said
Lady
Fawn
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
 
when
I
am
gone
.
<EOS>
I
must
be
off
now
,
only
I
could
not
bear
not
to
come
and
see
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
so
like
you
,
Frederic
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
'll
go
to
-
day
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Yes
;
if
you
wish
it
,
 
certainly
.
"
  
"
Go
up
in
the
carriage
,
you
know
,
and
take
one
of
the
girls
with
you
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
take
more
than
one
.
<EOS>
Augusta
will
be
the
best
.
<EOS>
You
'll
see
Clara
,
I
suppose
.
<EOS>
"
Clara
was
the
married
sister
,
Mrs.
Hittaway
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
wish
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
had
better
call
too
,
 
say
on
Thursday
.
<EOS>
It
's
quite
as
well
that
it
should
be
known
.
<EOS>
I
sha'n't
choose
to
have
more
delay
than
can
be
avoided
.
<EOS>
Well
;
 
I
believe
that
's
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
she
'll
be
a
good
wife
to
you
,
Frederic
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
see
why
she
should
n't
.
<EOS>
Good
-
bye
,
mother
.
<EOS>
Tell
the
girls
I
will
see
them
next
Saturday
.
"
<EOS>
He
did
n't
see
why
this
woman
he
was
about
to
marry
should
not
be
a
good
wife
to
him
!
<EOS>
And
yet
he
knew
nothing
about
her
,
and
had
not
taken
the
slightest
trouble
to
make
inquiry
.
<EOS>
That
she
was
pretty
he
could
see
;
that
she
was
clever
<EOS>
he
could
understand
;
that
she
lived
in
Mount
Street
was
a
fact
;
her
parentage
was
known
to
him
;
 
that
she
was
the
undoubted
mistress
of
a
large
income
was
beyond
dispute
.
<EOS>
But
,
for
aught
he
knew
,
she
might
be
afflicted
by
every
vice
to
which
a
woman
can
be
subject
.
<EOS>
In
truth
,
she
was
afflicted
by
so
many
,
that
the
addition
of
all
the
others
could
hardly
have
made
her
worse
than
she
was
.
<EOS>
She
had
never
sacrificed
her
beauty
to
a
lover
,
 
she
had
never
sacrificed
anything
to
anybody
,
 
nor
did
she
drink
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
difficult
,
perhaps
,
to
say
anything
else
in
her
favour
;
and
yet
Lord
Fawn
was
quite
content
to
marry
her
,
not
having
seen
any
reason
why
she
should
not
make
a
good
wife
!
<EOS>
Nor
had
Sir
Florian
seen
any
reason
;
 
but
she
had
broken
Sir
Florian
's
heart
.
  
<EOS>
When
the
girls
heard
the
news
,
they
were
half
frightened
and
half
delighted
.
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
and
her
daughters
lived
very
much
out
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
They
also
were
poor
rich
people
,
 
if
such
a
term
may
be
used
,
 
and
did
not
go
much
into
society
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
butler
kept
at
Fawn
Court
,
and
a
boy
in
buttons
,
and
two
gardeners
,
and
a
man
to
look
after
the
cows
,
and
a
carriage
and
horses
,
and
a
fat
coachman
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
cook
and
a
scullery
maid
,
and
two
lady
's
maids
,
 
who
had
to
make
the
dresses
,
 
and
two
housemaids
and
a
dairymaid
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
large
old
brick
house
to
be
kept
in
order
,
and
handsome
grounds
with
old
trees
.
<EOS>
There
was
,
as
we
know
,
a
governess
,
and
there
were
seven
unmarried
daughters
.
<EOS>
With
such
encumbrances
,
and
an
income
altogether
not
exceeding
three
thousand
pounds
per
annum
,
Lady
Fawn
could
not
be
rich
.
<EOS>
And
yet
who
would
say
that
an
old
lady
and
her
daughters
could
be
poor
with
three
thousand
pounds
a
year
to
spend
?
<EOS>
It
may
be
taken
almost
as
a
rule
by
the
unennobled
ones
of
this
country
,
that
the
sudden
possession
of
a
title
would
at
once
raise
the
price
of
every
article
consumed
twenty
per
cent
.
<EOS>
Mutton
that
before
cost
ninepence
would
cost
tenpence
a
pound
,
and
the
mouths
to
be
fed
would
demand
more
meat
.
<EOS>
The
chest
of
tea
would
run
out
quicker
.
<EOS>
The
labourer
's
work
,
which
for
the
farmer
is
ten
hours
a
day
,
for
the
squire
nine
,
is
for
the
peer
only
eight
.
<EOS>
Miss
Jones
,
when
she
becomes
Lady
de
Jongh
,
does
not
pay
less
than
threepence
apiece
for
each
"
my
lady
"
with
which
her
ear
is
tickled
.
<EOS>
Even
the
baronet
when
he
becomes
a
lord
has
to
curtail
his
purchases
,
because
of
increased
price
,
unless
he
be
very
wide
awake
to
the
affairs
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
Old
Lady
Fawn
,
who
would
not
on
any
account
have
owed
a
shilling
which
she
could
not
pay
,
and
who
,
in
the
midst
of
her
economies
,
was
not
close
-
fisted
,
knew
very
well
what
she
could
do
and
what
she
could
not
.
<EOS>
The
old
family
carriage
and
the
two
lady
's
maids
were
there
,
 
as
necessaries
of
life
;
but
London
society
was
not
within
her
reach
.
<EOS>
It
was
,
therefore
,
the
case
that
they
had
not
heard
very
much
about
Lizzie
Eustace
.
<EOS>
But
they
had
heard
something
.
<EOS>
"
I
hope
she
wo
n't
be
too
fond
of
going
out
,
"
said
Amelia
,
the
second
girl
.
  
<EOS>
"
Or
extravagant
,
"
said
Georgina
,
the
third
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
was
some
story
of
her
being
terribly
in
debt
when
she
married
Sir
Florian
Eustace
,
"
said
Diana
,
the
fourth
.
  
<EOS>
"
Frederic
will
be
sure
to
see
to
that
,
"
said
Augusta
,
the
eldest
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
is
very
beautiful
,
"
said
Lydia
,
the
fifth
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
clever
,
"
said
Cecilia
,
the
sixth
.
  
<EOS>
"
Beauty
and
cleverness
wo
n't
make
a
good
wife
,
"
said
Amelia
,
who
was
the
wise
one
of
the
family
.
  
<EOS>
"
Frederic
will
be
sure
to
see
that
she
does
n't
go
wrong
,
"
said
Augusta
,
who
was
not
wise
.
  
<EOS>
Then
Lucy
Morris
entered
the
room
with
Nina
,
the
cadette
of
the
family
.
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Nina
,
what
do
you
think
?
"
said
Lydia
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
!
"
said
Lady
Fawn
,
putting
up
her
hand
and
stopping
further
indiscreet
speech
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
mamma
,
what
is
it
?
"
asked
the
cadette
.
  
<EOS>
"
Surely
Lucy
may
be
told
,
"
said
Lydia
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
yes
;
Lucy
may
be
told
certainly
.
<EOS>
There
can
be
no
reason
why
Lucy
should
not
know
all
that
concerns
our
family
;
 
and
the
more
so
as
she
has
been
for
many
years
intimate
with
the
lady
.
<EOS>
My
dear
,
my
son
is
going
to
be
married
to
Lady
Eustace
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Lord
Fawn
going
to
marry
Lizzie
!
"
said
Lucy
Morris
,
in
a
tone
which
certainly
did
not
express
unmingled
satisfaction
.
  
<EOS>
"
Unless
you
forbid
the
banns
,
"
said
Diana
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
there
any
reason
why
he
should
not
?
"
said
Lady
Fawn
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
no
;
 
<EOS>
only
it
seems
so
odd
.
<EOS>
I
did
n't
know
that
they
knew
each
other
;
 
not
well
,
that
is
.
<EOS>
And
then
 
"
  
"
Then
what
,
my
dear
?
"
  
"
It
seems
odd
;
 
that
's
all
.
<EOS>
It
's
all
very
nice
,
I
dare
say
,
and
I
'm
sure
I
hope
they
will
be
happy
.
"
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
,
however
,
was
displeased
,
and
did
not
speak
to
Lucy
again
before
she
started
with
Augusta
on
the
journey
to
London
.
  
<EOS>
The
carriage
first
stopped
at
the
door
of
the
married
daughter
in
Warwick
Square
.
<EOS>
Now
,
Mrs.
Hittaway
,
whose
husband
was
chairman
of
the
Board
of
Civil
Appeals
and
who
was
very
well
known
at
all
Boards
and
among
official
men
generally
,
heard
much
more
about
things
that
were
going
on
than
did
her
mother
.
<EOS>
And
,
having
been
emancipated
from
maternal
control
for
the
last
ten
or
twelve
years
,
she
could
express
herself
before
her
mother
with
more
confidence
than
would
have
become
the
other
girls
.
<EOS>
"
Mamma
,
"
she
said
,
"
you
do
n't
mean
it
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
mean
it
,
Clara
.
<EOS>
Why
should
I
not
mean
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
is
the
greatest
vixen
in
all
London
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Clara
!
"
said
Augusta
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
such
a
liar
,
"
said
Mrs.
Hittaway
.
  
<EOS>
There
came
a
look
of
pain
across
Lady
Fawn
's
face
,
for
Lady
Fawn
believed
in
her
eldest
daughter
.
<EOS>
But
yet
she
intended
to
fight
her
ground
on
a
matter
so
important
to
her
as
was
this
.
<EOS>
"
There
is
no
word
in
the
English
language
,
"
she
said
,
"
which
conveys
to
me
so
little
of
defined
meaning
as
that
word
vixen
.
<EOS>
If
you
can
,
tell
me
what
you
mean
,
Clara
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Stop
it
,
mamma
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
why
should
I
stop
it
,
 
even
if
I
could
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
know
her
,
mamma
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
has
visited
at
Fawn
Court
,
more
than
once
.
<EOS>
She
is
a
friend
of
Lucy
's
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
she
is
a
friend
of
Lucy
Morris
,
mamma
,
Lucy
Morris
shall
never
come
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
what
has
she
done
?
<EOS>
I
have
never
heard
that
she
has
behaved
improperly
.
<EOS>
What
does
it
all
mean
?
<EOS>
She
goes
out
everywhere
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
think
she
has
had
any
lovers
.
<EOS>
Frederic
would
be
the
last
man
in
the
world
to
throw
himself
away
upon
an
ill
-
conditioned
young
woman
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Frederic
can
see
just
as
far
as
some
other
men
,
and
not
a
bit
farther
.
<EOS>
Of
course
she
has
an
income
,
 
for
her
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
it
is
her
own
altogether
,
Clara
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
says
so
,
I
do
n't
doubt
.
<EOS>
I
believe
she
is
the
greatest
liar
about
London
.
<EOS>
You
find
out
about
her
jewels
before
she
married
poor
Sir
Florian
,
and
how
much
he
had
to
pay
for
her
;
or
rather
,
I
'll
find
out
.
<EOS>
If
you
want
to
know
,
mamma
,
you
just
ask
her
own
aunt
,
Lady
Linlithgow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
all
know
,
<EOS>
my
dear
,
that
Lady
Linlithgow
quarrelled
with
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
my
belief
that
she
is
over
head
and
ears
in
debt
again
.
<EOS>
But
I
'll
learn
.
<EOS>
And
when
I
have
found
out
,
I
shall
not
scruple
to
tell
Frederic
.
<EOS>
Orlando
will
find
out
all
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
Orlando
was
the
Christian
name
of
Mrs.
Hittaway
's
husband
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Camperdown
,
I
have
no
doubt
,
knows
all
the
ins
and
outs
of
her
story
.
<EOS>
The
long
and
the
short
of
it
is
this
,
mamma
,
that
I
've
heard
quite
enough
about
Lady
Eustace
to
feel
certain
that
Frederic
would
live
to
repent
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
what
can
we
do
?
"
said
Lady
Fawn
.
  
<EOS>
"
Break
it
off
,
"
said
Mrs.
Hittaway
.
  
<EOS>
Her
daughter
's
violence
of
speech
had
a
most
depressing
effect
upon
poor
Lady
Fawn
.
<EOS>
As
has
been
said
,
she
did
believe
in
Mrs.
Hittaway
.
<EOS>
She
knew
that
Mrs.
Hittaway
was
conversant
with
the
things
of
the
world
,
and
heard
tidings
daily
which
never
found
their
way
down
to
Fawn
Court
.
<EOS>
And
yet
her
son
went
about
quite
as
much
as
did
her
daughter
.
<EOS>
If
Lady
Eustace
was
such
a
reprobate
as
was
now
represented
,
why
had
not
Lord
Fawn
heard
the
truth
?
<EOS>
And
then
she
had
already
given
in
her
own
adhesion
,
and
had
promised
to
call
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Do
you
mean
that
you
wo
n't
go
to
her
?
"
said
Lady
Fawn
.
  
<EOS>
"
As
Lady
Eustace
,
 
certainly
not
.
<EOS>
If
Frederic
does
marry
her
,
of
course
I
must
know
her
.
<EOS>
That
's
a
different
thing
.
<EOS>
One
has
to
make
the
best
one
can
of
a
bad
bargain
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
doubt
they
'd
be
separated
before
two
years
were
over
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
dear
,
how
dreadful
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Augusta
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
,
after
much
consideration
,
was
of
opinion
that
she
must
carry
out
her
intention
of
calling
upon
her
son
's
intended
bride
in
spite
of
all
the
evil
things
that
had
been
said
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
had
undertaken
to
send
a
message
to
Mount
Street
,
informing
the
lady
of
the
honour
intended
for
her
.
<EOS>
And
in
truth
Lady
Fawn
was
somewhat
curious
now
to
see
the
household
of
the
woman
who
might
perhaps
do
her
the
irreparable
injury
of
ruining
the
happiness
of
her
only
son
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
she
might
learn
something
by
looking
at
the
woman
in
her
own
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
At
any
rate
she
would
go
.
<EOS>
But
Mrs.
Hittaway
's
words
had
the
effect
of
inducing
her
to
leave
Augusta
where
she
was
.
<EOS>
If
there
were
contamination
,
why
should
Augusta
be
contaminated
?
<EOS>
Poor
Augusta
!
<EOS>
She
had
looked
forward
to
the
delight
of
embracing
her
future
sister
-
in
-
law
;
 
and
would
not
have
enjoyed
it
the
less
,
perhaps
,
because
she
had
been
told
that
the
lady
was
false
,
profligate
,
and
a
vixen
.
<EOS>
As
,
however
,
her
position
was
that
of
a
girl
,
she
was
bound
to
be
obedient
,
 
though
over
thirty
years
old
,
 
and
she
obeyed
.
  
<EOS>
Lizzie
was
of
course
at
home
,
and
Miss
Macnulty
was
of
course
visiting
the
Horticultural
Gardens
or
otherwise
engaged
.
<EOS>
On
such
an
occasion
Lizzie
would
certainly
be
alone
.
<EOS>
She
had
taken
great
pains
with
her
dress
,
studying
not
so
much
her
own
appearance
as
the
character
of
her
visitor
.
<EOS>
She
was
very
anxious
,
at
any
rate
for
the
present
,
to
win
golden
opinions
from
Lady
Fawn
.
<EOS>
She
was
dressed
richly
,
but
very
simply
.
<EOS>
Everything
about
her
room
betokened
wealth
;
but
she
had
put
away
the
French
novels
,
and
had
placed
a
Bible
on
a
little
table
,
not
quite
hidden
,
behind
her
own
seat
.
<EOS>
The
long
lustrous
lock
was
tucked
up
,
but
the
diamonds
were
still
upon
her
fingers
.
<EOS>
She
fully
intended
to
make
a
conquest
of
her
future
mother
-
in
-
law
and
sister
-
in
-
law
;
 
for
the
note
which
had
come
up
to
her
from
the
India
Office
had
told
her
that
Augusta
would
accompany
Lady
Fawn
.
<EOS>
"
Augusta
is
my
favourite
sister
,
"
said
the
enamoured
lover
,
"
and
I
hope
that
you
two
will
always
be
friends
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Lizzie
,
when
she
had
read
this
,
had
declared
to
herself
that
of
all
the
female
oafs
she
had
ever
seen
,
Augusta
Fawn
was
the
greatest
oaf
.
<EOS>
When
she
found
that
Lady
Fawn
was
alone
,
she
did
not
betray
herself
,
or
ask
for
the
beloved
friend
of
the
future
.
<EOS>
"
Dear
,
dear
Lady
Fawn
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
throwing
herself
into
the
arms
and
nestling
herself
against
the
bosom
of
the
old
lady
<EOS>
,
"
this
makes
my
happiness
perfect
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Then
she
retreated
a
little
,
still
holding
the
hand
she
had
grasped
between
her
own
,
and
looking
up
into
the
face
of
her
future
mother
-
in
-
law
.
<EOS>
"
When
he
asked
me
to
be
his
wife
,
the
first
thing
I
thought
of
was
whether
you
would
come
to
me
at
once
.
"
<EOS>
Her
voice
as
she
thus
spoke
was
perfect
.
<EOS>
Her
manner
was
almost
perfect
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
there
was
a
little
too
much
of
gesture
,
too
much
gliding
motion
,
too
violent
an
appeal
with
the
eyes
,
too
close
a
pressure
of
the
hand
.
<EOS>
No
suspicion
,
however
,
of
all
this
would
have
touched
Lady
Fawn
had
she
come
to
Mount
Street
without
calling
in
Warwick
Square
on
the
way
.
<EOS>
But
those
horrible
words
of
her
daughter
were
ringing
in
her
ears
,
and
she
did
not
know
how
to
conduct
herself
.
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
I
came
as
soon
as
he
told
me
,
"
she
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
will
be
a
mother
to
me
?
"
demanded
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
Poor
Lady
Fawn
!
<EOS>
There
was
enough
of
maternity
about
her
to
have
enabled
her
to
undertake
the
duty
for
a
dozen
sons
"
wives
,
 
if
the
wives
were
women
with
whom
she
could
feel
sympathy
.
<EOS>
And
she
could
feel
sympathy
very
easily
;
and
was
a
woman
not
at
all
prone
to
inquire
too
curiously
as
to
the
merits
of
a
son
's
wife
.
<EOS>
But
what
was
she
to
do
after
the
caution
she
had
received
from
Mrs.
Hittaway
?
<EOS>
How
was
she
to
promise
maternal
tenderness
to
a
vixen
and
a
liar
?
<EOS>
By
nature
she
was
not
a
deceitful
woman
.
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
"
she
said
,
"
I
hope
you
will
make
him
a
good
wife
.
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
not
very
encouraging
,
but
Lizzie
made
the
best
of
it
.
<EOS>
It
was
her
desire
to
cheat
Lady
Fawn
into
a
good
opinion
,
and
she
was
not
disappointed
when
no
good
opinion
was
expressed
at
once
.
<EOS>
It
is
seldom
that
a
bad
person
expects
to
be
accounted
good
.
<EOS>
It
is
the
general
desire
of
such
a
one
to
conquer
the
existing
evil
impression
;
but
it
is
generally
presumed
that
the
evil
impression
is
there
.
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
Lady
Fawn
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
"
I
will
so
strive
to
make
him
happy
.
<EOS>
What
is
it
that
he
likes
?
<EOS>
What
would
he
wish
me
to
do
and
to
be
?
<EOS>
You
know
his
noble
nature
,
and
I
must
look
to
you
for
guidance
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
was
embarrassed
.
<EOS>
She
had
now
seated
herself
on
the
sofa
,
and
Lizzie
was
close
to
her
,
almost
enveloped
within
her
mantle
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
,
"
said
Lady
Fawn
,
"
if
you
will
endeavour
to
do
your
duty
by
him
,
I
am
sure
he
will
do
his
by
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
it
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
of
it
.
<EOS>
And
I
will
;
I
will
.
<EOS>
You
will
let
me
love
you
,
and
call
you
mother
?
"
<EOS>
A
peculiar
perfume
came
up
from
Lizzie
's
hair
which
Lady
Fawn
did
not
like
.
<EOS>
Her
own
girls
,
perhaps
,
were
not
given
to
the
use
of
much
perfumery
.
<EOS>
She
shifted
her
seat
a
little
,
and
Lizzie
was
compelled
to
sit
upright
,
and
without
support
.
<EOS>
Hitherto
Lady
Fawn
had
said
very
little
,
and
Lizzie
's
part
was
one
difficult
to
play
.
<EOS>
She
had
heard
of
that
sermon
read
every
Sunday
evening
at
Fawn
Court
,
and
she
believed
that
Lady
Fawn
was
peculiarly
religious
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
There
,
"
she
said
,
stretching
out
her
hand
backwards
and
clasping
the
book
which
lay
upon
the
small
table
,
 
"
there
;
that
shall
be
my
guide
.
<EOS>
That
will
teach
me
how
to
do
my
duty
by
my
noble
husband
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
in
some
surprise
took
the
book
from
Lizzie
's
hand
,
and
found
that
it
was
the
Bible
.
<EOS>
"
You
certainly
ca
n't
do
better
,
my
dear
,
than
read
your
Bible
,
"
said
Lady
Fawn
,
 
<EOS>
but
there
was
more
of
censure
than
of
eulogy
in
the
tone
of
her
voice
.
<EOS>
She
put
the
Bible
down
very
quietly
,
and
asked
Lady
Eustace
when
it
would
suit
her
to
come
down
to
Fawn
Court
.
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
had
promised
her
son
to
give
the
invitation
,
and
could
not
now
,
she
thought
,
avoid
giving
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
should
like
it
so
much
!
"
said
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
"
Whenever
it
will
suit
you
,
I
will
be
there
at
a
minute
's
notice
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
then
arranged
that
she
should
be
at
Fawn
Court
on
that
day
week
,
and
stay
for
a
fortnight
.
<EOS>
"
Of
all
things
that
which
I
most
desire
now
,
"
said
Lizzie
,
"
is
to
know
you
and
the
dear
girls
,
 
and
to
be
loved
by
you
all
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lady
Eustace
,
as
soon
as
she
was
alone
in
the
room
,
stood
in
the
middle
of
it
,
scowling
,
 
for
she
could
scowl
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
not
go
near
them
,
"
she
said
to
herself
,
 
"
nasty
,
stupid
,
dull
,
puritanical
drones
.
<EOS>
If
he
do
n't
like
it
,
he
may
lump
it
.
<EOS>
After
all
it
's
no
such
great
catch
.
<EOS>
"
Then
she
sat
down
to
reflect
whether
it
was
or
was
not
a
catch
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
ever
Lord
Fawn
had
left
her
after
the
engagement
was
made
,
she
had
begun
to
tell
herself
that
he
was
a
poor
creature
,
and
that
she
had
done
wrong
.
"
<EOS>
Only
five
thousand
a
year
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
said
to
herself
;
 
for
she
had
not
perfectly
understood
that
little
explanation
which
he
had
given
respecting
his
income
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
nothing
for
a
lord
.
"
<EOS>
And
now
again
she
murmured
to
herself
,
<EOS>
"
It
's
my
money
<EOS>
he
's
after
.
<EOS>
He
'll
find
out
that
I
know
how
to
keep
what
I
've
got
in
my
own
hands
.
"
<EOS>
Now
that
Lady
Fawn
had
been
cold
to
her
,
she
thought
still
less
of
the
proposed
marriage
.
<EOS>
But
there
was
this
inducement
for
her
to
go
on
with
it
.
<EOS>
If
they
,
the
Fawn
women
,
thought
that
they
could
break
it
off
,
she
would
let
them
know
that
they
had
no
such
power
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
mamma
,
you
've
seen
her
?
"
said
Mrs.
Hittaway
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
my
dear
;
I
've
seen
her
.
<EOS>
I
had
seen
her
two
or
three
times
before
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
are
still
in
love
with
her
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
said
that
I
was
in
love
with
her
,
Clara
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
what
has
been
fixed
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
is
to
come
down
to
Fawn
Court
next
week
,
and
stay
a
fortnight
with
us
.
<EOS>
Then
we
shall
find
out
what
she
is
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
will
be
best
,
mamma
,
"
said
Augusta
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mind
,
mamma
<EOS>
;
you
understand
me
.
<EOS>
I
shall
tell
Frederic
plainly
just
what
I
think
.
<EOS>
Of
course
he
will
be
offended
,
and
if
the
marriage
goes
on
,
the
offence
will
remain
,
 
till
he
finds
out
the
truth
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
he
'll
find
out
no
such
truth
,
"
said
Lady
Fawn
.
<EOS>
She
was
,
however
,
quite
unable
to
say
a
word
in
behalf
of
her
future
daughter
-
in
-
law
.
<EOS>
She
said
nothing
as
to
that
little
scene
with
the
Bible
,
but
she
never
forgot
it
.
   
<EOS>
Lizzie
and
Her
Lover
 
<EOS>
During
the
remainder
of
that
Monday
and
all
the
Tuesday
,
Lizzie
's
mind
was
,
upon
the
whole
,
averse
to
matrimony
.
<EOS>
She
had
told
Miss
Macnulty
of
her
prospects
,
with
some
amount
of
exultation
;
and
the
poor
dependant
,
though
she
knew
that
she
must
be
turned
out
into
the
street
,
had
congratulated
her
patroness
.
"
<EOS>
The
Vulturess
will
take
you
in
again
,
when
she
knows
you
've
nowhere
else
to
go
,
"
Lizzie
had
said
,
 
displaying
,
indeed
,
some
accurate
discernment
of
her
aunt
's
character
.
<EOS>
But
after
Lady
Fawn
's
visit
she
spoke
of
the
marriage
in
a
different
tone
.
<EOS>
"
Of
course
,
my
dear
,
I
shall
have
to
look
very
close
after
the
settlement
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
the
lawyers
will
do
that
,
"
said
Miss
Macnulty
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
 
lawyers
!
<EOS>
That
's
all
very
well
.
<EOS>
I
know
what
lawyers
are
.
<EOS>
I
'm
not
going
to
trust
any
lawyer
to
give
away
my
property
.
<EOS>
Of
course
we
shall
live
at
Portray
,
because
his
place
is
in
Ireland
;
 
and
nothing
shall
take
me
to
Ireland
.
<EOS>
I
told
him
that
from
the
very
first
.
<EOS>
But
I
do
n't
mean
to
give
up
my
own
income
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
suppose
he
'll
venture
to
suggest
such
a
thing
.
"
<EOS>
And
then
again
she
grumbled
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
all
very
well
being
in
the
Cabinet
 
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
Lord
Fawn
in
the
Cabinet
?
"
asked
Miss
Macnulty
,
who
in
such
matters
was
not
altogether
ignorant
.
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
he
is
,
"
said
Lizzie
,
with
an
angry
gesture
.
<EOS>
It
may
seem
unjust
to
accuse
her
of
being
stupidly
unacquainted
with
circumstances
,
and
a
liar
at
the
same
time
;
but
she
was
both
.
<EOS>
She
said
that
Lord
Fawn
was
in
the
Cabinet
because
she
had
heard
some
one
speak
of
him
as
not
being
a
Cabinet
Minister
,
and
in
so
speaking
appear
to
slight
his
political
position
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
did
not
know
how
much
her
companion
knew
,
and
Miss
Macnulty
did
not
comprehend
the
depth
of
the
ignorance
of
her
patroness
.
<EOS>
Thus
the
lies
which
Lizzie
told
were
amazing
to
Miss
Macnulty
.
<EOS>
To
say
that
Lord
Fawn
was
in
the
Cabinet
,
when
all
the
world
knew
that
he
was
an
Under
-
Secretary
!
<EOS>
What
good
could
a
woman
get
from
an
assertion
so
plainly
,
so
manifestly
false
?
<EOS>
But
Lizzie
knew
nothing
of
Under
-
Secretaries
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
was
a
lord
,
and
even
commoners
were
in
the
Cabinet
.
<EOS>
"
Of
course
he
is
,
"
said
Lizzie
;
"
but
I
sha'n't
have
my
drawing
-
room
made
a
Cabinet
.
<EOS>
They
sha'n't
come
here
.
"
<EOS>
And
then
again
on
the
Tuesday
evening
she
displayed
her
independence
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
for
those
women
down
at
Richmond
,
I
do
n't
mean
to
be
overrun
by
them
,
I
can
tell
you
.
<EOS>
I
said
I
would
go
there
,
and
of
course
I
shall
keep
my
word
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
had
better
go
,
"
said
Miss
Macnulty
.
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
,
I
shall
go
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
want
anybody
to
tell
me
where
I
'm
to
go
,
my
dear
,
and
where
I
'm
not
.
<EOS>
But
it
'll
be
about
the
first
and
the
last
visit
.
<EOS>
And
as
for
bringing
those
dowdy
girls
out
in
London
,
it
's
the
last
thing
I
shall
think
of
doing
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
I
doubt
whether
they
can
afford
to
dress
themselves
.
"
<EOS>
As
she
went
up
to
bed
on
the
Tuesday
evening
,
Miss
Macnulty
doubted
whether
the
match
would
go
on
.
<EOS>
She
never
believed
her
friend
's
statements
;
but
if
spoken
words
might
be
supposed
to
mean
anything
,
Lady
Eustace
's
words
on
that
Tuesday
betokened
a
strong
dislike
to
everything
appertaining
to
the
Fawn
family
.
<EOS>
She
had
even
ridiculed
Lord
Fawn
himself
,
declaring
that
he
understood
nothing
about
anything
beyond
his
office
.
  
<EOS>
And
,
in
truth
,
Lizzie
almost
had
made
up
her
mind
to
break
it
off
.
<EOS>
All
that
she
would
gain
did
not
seem
to
weigh
down
with
sufficient
preponderance
all
that
she
would
lose
.
<EOS>
Such
were
her
feelings
on
the
Tuesday
night
.
<EOS>
But
on
the
Wednesday
morning
she
received
a
note
which
threw
her
back
violently
upon
the
Fawn
interest
.
<EOS>
The
note
was
as
follows
:
"
Messrs.
Camperdown
and
Son
present
their
compliments
to
Lady
Eustace
.
<EOS>
They
have
received
instructions
to
proceed
by
law
for
the
recovery
of
the
Eustace
diamonds
,
now
in
Lady
Eustace
's
hands
,
and
will
feel
obliged
to
Lady
Eustace
if
she
will
communicate
to
them
the
name
and
address
of
her
attorney
.
<EOS>

,
New
Square
,
May

,

.
<EOS>
"
The
effect
of
this
note
was
to
drive
Lizzie
back
upon
the
Fawn
interest
.
<EOS>
She
was
frightened
about
the
diamonds
,
and
was
,
nevertheless
,
almost
determined
not
to
surrender
them
.
<EOS>
At
any
rate
,
in
such
a
strait
she
would
want
assistance
,
either
in
keeping
them
or
in
giving
them
up
.
<EOS>
The
lawyer
's
letter
afflicted
her
with
a
sense
of
weakness
,
and
there
was
strength
in
the
Fawn
connexion
.
<EOS>
As
Lord
Fawn
was
so
poor
,
perhaps
he
would
adhere
to
the
jewels
.
<EOS>
She
knew
that
she
could
not
fight
Mr.
Camperdown
with
no
other
assistance
than
what
Messrs.
Mowbray
and
Mopus
might
give
her
,
and
therefore
her
heart
softened
towards
her
betrothed
.
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
Frederic
will
be
here
to
-
day
,
"
she
said
to
Miss
Macnulty
,
as
they
sat
at
breakfast
together
about
noon
.
<EOS>
Miss
Macnulty
nodded
.
<EOS>
"
You
can
have
a
cab
,
you
know
,
if
you
like
to
go
anywhere
.
"
<EOS>
Miss
Macnulty
said
she
thought
she
would
go
to
the
National
Gallery
.
"
<EOS>
And
you
can
walk
back
,
you
know
,
"
said
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
walk
there
and
back
too
,
"
said
Miss
Macnulty
,
 
in
regard
to
whom
it
may
be
said
that
the
last
ounce
would
sometimes
almost
break
the
horse
's
back
.
  
<EOS>
"
Frederic
"
came
and
was
received
very
graciously
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
had
placed
Mr.
Camperdown
's
note
on
the
little
table
behind
her
,
beneath
the
Bible
,
so
that
she
might
put
her
hand
upon
it
at
once
,
if
she
could
make
an
opportunity
of
showing
it
to
her
future
husband
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Frederic
"
sat
himself
beside
her
,
and
the
intercourse
for
awhile
was
<EOS>
such
as
might
be
looked
for
between
two
lovers
of
whom
one
was
a
widow
,
and
the
other
an
Under
-
Secretary
of
State
from
the
India
Office
.
<EOS>
They
were
loving
,
but
discreetly
amatory
,
talking
chiefly
of
things
material
,
each
flattering
the
other
,
and
each
hinting
now
and
again
at
certain
little
circumstances
of
which
a
more
accurate
knowledge
seemed
to
be
desirable
.
<EOS>
The
one
was
conversant
with
things
in
general
,
but
was
slow
;
the
other
was
quick
as
a
lizard
in
turning
hither
and
thither
,
but
knew
almost
nothing
.
<EOS>
When
she
told
Lord
Fawn
that
the
Ayrshire
estate
was
"
her
own
,
to
do
what
she
liked
with
,
"
she
did
not
know
that
he
would
certainly
find
out
the
truth
from
other
sources
before
he
married
her
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
she
was
not
quite
sure
herself
whether
the
statement
was
true
or
false
,
though
she
would
not
have
made
it
so
frequently
had
her
idea
of
the
truth
been
a
fixed
idea
.
<EOS>
It
had
all
been
explained
to
her
;
 
but
there
had
been
something
about
a
second
son
,
and
there
was
no
second
son
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
she
might
have
a
second
son
yet
,
 
a
future
little
Lord
Fawn
,
and
he
might
inherit
it
.
<EOS>
In
regard
to
honesty
,
the
man
was
superior
to
the
woman
,
because
his
purpose
was
declared
,
and
he
told
no
lies
;
 
but
the
one
was
as
mercenary
as
the
other
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
love
that
had
brought
Lord
Fawn
to
Mount
Street
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
the
name
of
your
place
in
Ireland
?
<EOS>
"
she
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
no
house
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
there
was
one
,
Frederic
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
town
-
land
where
the
house
used
to
be
,
is
called
Killeagent
.
<EOS>
The
old
demesne
is
called
Killaud
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
pretty
names
!
<EOS>
and
 
and
 
does
it
go
a
great
many
miles
?
"
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
explained
that
it
did
run
a
good
many
miles
up
into
the
mountains
.
"
<EOS>
How
beautifully
romantic
!
"
said
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
"
But
the
people
live
on
the
mountain
and
pay
rent
?
"
  
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
asked
no
such
inept
questions
respecting
the
Ayrshire
property
,
but
he
did
inquire
who
was
Lizzie
's
solicitor
.
<EOS>
"
Of
course
there
will
be
things
to
be
settled
,
"
he
said
,
"
and
my
lawyer
had
better
see
yours
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Camperdown
is
a
 
"
  
"
Mr.
Camperdown
!
<EOS>
"
almost
shrieked
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
then
explained
,
with
some
amazement
,
that
Mr.
Camperdown
was
his
lawyer
.
<EOS>
As
far
as
his
belief
went
,
there
was
not
a
more
respectable
gentleman
in
the
profession
.
<EOS>
Then
he
inquired
whether
Lizzie
had
any
objection
to
Mr.
Camperdown
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Camperdown
was
Sir
Florian
's
lawyer
,
"
said
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
will
make
it
all
the
easier
,
I
should
think
,
"
said
Lord
Fawn
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
how
that
may
be
,
"
said
Lizzie
,
trying
to
bring
her
mind
to
work
upon
the
subject
steadily
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Camperdown
has
been
very
uncourteous
to
me
;
 
I
must
say
that
;
and
,
as
I
think
,
unfair
.
<EOS>
He
wishes
to
rob
me
now
of
a
thing
that
is
quite
my
own
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
sort
of
a
thing
?
"
asked
Lord
Fawn
slowly
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
very
valuable
thing
.
<EOS>
I
'll
tell
you
all
about
it
,
Frederic
.
<EOS>
Of
course
I
'll
tell
you
everything
now
.
<EOS>
I
never
could
keep
back
anything
from
one
that
I
loved
.
<EOS>
It
's
not
my
nature
.
<EOS>
There
;
you
might
as
well
read
that
note
.
<EOS>
"
Then
she
put
her
hand
back
and
brought
Mr.
Camperdown
's
letter
from
under
the
Bible
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
read
it
very
attentively
,
and
as
he
read
it
there
came
upon
him
a
great
doubt
.
<EOS>
What
sort
of
woman
was
this
to
whom
he
had
engaged
himself
because
she
was
possessed
of
an
income
?
<EOS>
That
Mr.
Camperdown
should
be
in
the
wrong
in
such
a
matter
was
an
idea
which
never
occurred
to
Lord
Fawn
.
<EOS>
There
is
no
form
of
belief
stronger
than
that
which
the
ordinary
English
gentleman
has
in
the
discretion
and
honesty
of
his
own
family
lawyer
.
<EOS>
What
his
lawyer
tells
him
to
do
,
he
does
.
<EOS>
What
his
lawyer
tells
him
to
sign
,
he
signs
.
<EOS>
He
buys
and
sells
in
obedience
to
the
same
direction
,
and
feels
perfectly
comfortable
in
the
possession
of
a
guide
who
is
responsible
and
all
but
divine
.
<EOS>
"
What
diamonds
are
they
?
"
asked
Lord
Fawn
in
a
very
low
voice
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
are
my
own
,
 
altogether
my
own
.
<EOS>
Sir
Florian
gave
them
to
me
.
<EOS>
When
he
put
them
into
my
hands
,
he
said
that
they
were
to
be
my
own
for
ever
and
ever
.
<EOS>
"
There
,
"
said
he
,
 
"
those
are
yours
to
do
what
you
choose
with
them
.
"
<EOS>
After
that
they
ought
n't
to
ask
me
to
give
them
back
,
 
ought
they
?
<EOS>
If
you
had
been
married
before
,
and
your
wife
had
given
you
a
keepsake
,
 
to
keep
for
ever
and
ever
,
would
you
give
it
up
to
a
lawyer
?
<EOS>
You
would
not
like
it
;
 
would
you
,
Frederic
?
"
<EOS>
She
had
put
her
hand
on
his
,
and
was
looking
up
into
his
face
as
she
asked
the
question
.
<EOS>
Again
,
perhaps
,
the
acting
was
a
little
overdone
;
but
there
were
the
tears
in
her
eyes
,
and
the
tone
of
her
voice
was
perfect
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Camperdown
calls
them
Eustace
diamonds
,
 
family
diamonds
,
"
said
Lord
Fawn
.
<EOS>
"
What
do
they
consist
of
?
<EOS>
What
are
they
worth
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
show
them
to
you
,
"
said
Lizzie
,
jumping
up
and
hurrying
out
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
,
when
he
was
alone
,
rubbed
his
hands
over
his
eyes
and
thought
about
it
all
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
a
very
harsh
measure
,
on
the
part
of
the
Eustace
family
and
of
Mr.
Camperdown
,
to
demand
from
her
the
surrender
of
any
trinket
which
her
late
husband
might
have
given
her
in
the
manner
she
had
described
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
,
to
his
thinking
,
most
improbable
that
the
Eustace
people
or
the
lawyer
should
be
harsh
to
a
widow
bearing
the
Eustace
name
.
<EOS>
The
Eustaces
were
by
disposition
lavish
,
and
old
Mr.
Camperdown
was
not
one
who
would
be
strict
in
claiming
little
things
for
rich
clients
.
<EOS>
And
yet
here
was
his
letter
,
threatening
the
widow
of
the
late
baronet
with
legal
proceedings
for
the
recovery
of
jewels
which
had
been
given
by
Sir
Florian
himself
to
his
wife
as
a
keepsake
!
<EOS>
Perhaps
Sir
Florian
had
made
some
mistake
,
and
had
caused
to
be
set
in
a
ring
or
brooch
for
his
bride
some
jewel
which
he
had
thought
to
be
his
own
,
but
which
had
,
in
truth
,
been
an
heirloom
.
<EOS>
If
so
,
the
jewel
should
,
of
course
,
be
surrendered
,
 
or
replaced
by
one
of
equal
value
.
<EOS>
He
was
making
out
some
such
solution
,
when
Lizzie
returned
with
the
morocco
case
in
her
hand
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
the
manner
in
which
he
gave
it
to
me
,
"
said
Lizzie
,
as
she
opened
the
clasp
,
"
which
makes
its
value
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
knew
nothing
about
jewels
,
but
even
he
knew
that
if
the
circle
of
stones
which
he
saw
,
with
a
Maltese
cross
appended
to
it
,
was
constituted
of
real
diamonds
,
the
thing
must
be
of
great
value
.
<EOS>
And
it
occurred
to
him
at
once
that
such
a
necklace
is
not
given
by
a
husband
even
to
a
bride
in
the
manner
described
by
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
A
ring
,
or
brooch
,
or
perhaps
a
bracelet
,
a
lover
or
a
loving
lord
may
bring
in
his
pocket
.
<EOS>
But
such
an
ornament
as
this
on
which
Lord
Fawn
was
now
looking
,
is
given
in
another
sort
of
way
.
<EOS>
He
felt
sure
that
it
was
so
,
even
though
he
was
entirely
ignorant
of
the
value
of
the
stones
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Do
you
know
what
it
is
worth
?
"
he
asked
.
  
<EOS>
Lizzie
hesitated
a
moment
,
and
then
remembered
that
"
Frederic
,
"
in
his
present
position
in
regard
to
herself
,
might
be
glad
to
assist
her
in
maintaining
the
possession
of
a
substantial
property
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
they
say
its
value
is
about
 
ten
thousand
pounds
,
"
she
replied
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ten
 
thousand
 
pounds
!
"
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
riveted
his
eyes
upon
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
what
I
am
told
 
by
a
jeweller
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
By
what
jeweller
?
"
  
"
A
man
had
to
come
and
see
them
,
 
about
some
repairs
,
 
or
something
of
that
kind
.
<EOS>
Poor
Sir
Florian
wished
it
.
<EOS>
And
he
said
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
was
the
man
's
name
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
forget
his
name
,
"
said
Lizzie
,
who
was
not
quite
sure
whether
her
acquaintance
with
Mr.
Benjamin
would
be
considered
respectable
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ten
thousand
pounds
!
<EOS>
You
do
n't
keep
them
in
the
house
;
 
do
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
an
iron
case
up
-
stairs
for
them
;
 
ever
so
heavy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
did
Sir
Florian
give
you
the
iron
case
?
"
  
<EOS>
Lizzie
hesitated
for
a
moment
.
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
she
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
That
is
,
 
no
.
<EOS>
But
he
ordered
it
to
be
made
;
and
then
it
came
,
 
after
he
was
 
dead
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
knew
their
value
,
then
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
dear
,
yes
.
<EOS>
Though
he
never
named
any
sum
.
<EOS>
He
told
me
,
however
,
that
they
were
very
 
very
valuable
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
did
not
immediately
recognise
the
falseness
of
every
word
that
the
woman
said
to
him
,
because
he
was
slow
and
could
not
think
and
hear
at
the
same
time
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
at
once
involved
in
a
painful
maze
of
doubt
and
almost
of
dismay
.
<EOS>
An
action
for
the
recovery
of
jewels
brought
against
the
lady
whom
he
was
engaged
to
marry
,
on
behalf
of
the
family
of
her
late
husband
,
would
not
suit
him
at
all
.
<EOS>
To
have
his
hands
quite
clean
,
to
be
above
all
evil
report
,
to
be
respectable
,
as
it
were
,
all
round
,
was
Lord
Fawn
's
special
ambition
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
poor
man
,
and
a
greedy
man
,
but
he
would
have
abandoned
his
official
salary
at
a
moment
's
notice
,
rather
than
there
should
have
fallen
on
him
a
breath
of
public
opinion
hinting
that
it
ought
to
be
abandoned
.
<EOS>
He
was
especially
timid
,
and
lived
in
a
perpetual
fear
lest
the
newspapers
should
say
something
hard
of
him
.
<EOS>
In
that
matter
of
the
Sawab
he
had
been
very
wretched
,
because
Frank
Greystock
had
accused
him
of
being
an
administrator
of
tyranny
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
liked
his
wife
to
have
ten
thousand
pounds
"
worth
of
diamonds
very
well
;
but
he
would
rather
go
without
a
wife
for
ever
,
 
and
without
a
wife
's
fortune
,
 
than
marry
a
woman
subject
to
an
action
for
claiming
diamonds
not
her
own
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
"
said
he
,
at
last
,
"
that
if
you
were
to
put
them
into
Mr.
Camperdown
's
hands
 
"
  
"
Into
Mr.
Camperdown
's
hands
!
"
  
"
And
then
let
the
matter
be
settled
by
arbitration
 
"
  
"
Arbitration
?
<EOS>
That
means
going
to
law
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
No
,
<EOS>
dearest
,
 
that
means
not
going
to
law
.
<EOS>
The
diamonds
would
be
entrusted
to
Mr.
Camperdown
.
<EOS>
And
then
some
one
would
be
appointed
to
decide
whose
property
they
were
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
're
my
property
,
"
said
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
he
says
they
belong
to
the
family
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
'll
say
anything
,
"
said
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dearest
girl
,
there
ca
n't
be
a
more
respectable
man
than
Mr.
Camperdown
.
<EOS>
You
must
do
something
of
the
kind
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
sha'n't
do
anything
of
the
kind
,
"
said
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Sir
Florian
Eustace
gave
them
to
me
,
and
I
shall
keep
them
.
<EOS>
"
She
did
not
look
at
her
lover
as
she
spoke
;
but
he
looked
at
her
,
and
did
not
like
the
change
which
he
saw
on
her
countenance
.
<EOS>
And
he
did
not
like
the
circumstances
in
which
he
found
himself
placed
.
<EOS>
"
Why
should
Mr.
Camperdown
interfere
?
<EOS>
"
continued
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
"
If
they
do
n't
belong
to
me
,
they
belong
to
my
son
;
 
and
who
has
so
good
a
right
to
keep
them
for
him
as
I
have
?
<EOS>
But
they
belong
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
should
not
be
kept
in
a
private
house
like
this
at
all
,
if
they
are
worth
all
that
money
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
were
to
let
them
go
,
Mr.
Camperdown
would
get
them
.
<EOS>
There
's
nothing
he
would
n't
do
to
get
them
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
Frederic
,
I
hope
you
'll
stand
to
me
,
and
not
see
me
injured
.
<EOS>
Of
course
I
only
want
them
for
my
darling
child
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Frederic
's
face
had
become
very
long
,
and
he
was
much
disturbed
in
his
mind
.
<EOS>
He
could
only
suggest
that
he
himself
would
go
and
see
Mr.
Camperdown
,
and
ascertain
what
ought
to
be
done
.
<EOS>
To
the
last
,
he
adhered
to
his
assurance
that
Mr.
Camperdown
could
do
no
evil
;
 
till
Lizzie
,
in
her
wrath
,
asked
him
whether
he
believed
Mr.
Camperdown
's
word
before
hers
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
he
would
understand
a
matter
of
business
better
than
you
,
"
said
the
prudent
lover
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
wants
to
rob
me
,
"
said
Lizzie
,
"
and
I
shall
look
to
you
to
prevent
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
When
Lord
Fawn
took
his
leave
,
 
which
he
did
not
do
till
he
had
counselled
her
again
and
again
to
leave
the
matter
in
Mr.
Camperdown
's
hands
,
 
the
two
were
not
in
good
accord
together
.
<EOS>
It
was
his
fixed
purpose
,
as
he
declared
to
her
,
to
see
Mr.
Camperdown
;
and
it
was
her
fixed
purpose
,
 
so
<EOS>
,
at
least
,
she
declared
to
him
,
 
to
keep
the
diamonds
,
in
spite
of
Mr.
Camperdown
.
"
<EOS>
But
,
my
dear
,
if
it
's
decided
against
you
 
"
said
Lord
Fawn
gravely
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
ca
n't
be
decided
against
me
,
if
you
stand
by
me
as
you
ought
to
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
do
nothing
,
"
said
Lord
Fawn
,
in
a
tremor
.
<EOS>
Then
Lizzie
looked
at
him
,
 
and
her
look
,
which
was
very
eloquent
,
called
him
a
poltroon
as
plain
as
a
look
could
speak
.
<EOS>
Then
they
parted
,
and
the
signs
of
affection
between
them
were
not
satisfactory
.
  
<EOS>
The
door
was
hardly
closed
behind
him
before
Lizzie
began
to
declare
to
herself
that
he
should
n't
escape
her
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
yet
twenty
-
four
hours
since
she
had
been
telling
herself
that
she
did
not
like
the
engagement
and
would
break
it
off
;
and
now
she
was
stamping
her
little
feet
,
and
clenching
her
little
hands
,
and
swearing
to
herself
by
all
her
gods
,
that
this
wretched
,
timid
lordling
should
not
get
out
of
her
net
.
<EOS>
She
did
,
in
truth
,
despise
him
because
he
would
not
clutch
the
jewels
.
<EOS>
She
looked
upon
him
as
mean
and
paltry
because
he
was
willing
to
submit
to
Mr.
Camperdown
.
<EOS>
But
still
she
was
prompted
to
demand
all
that
could
be
demanded
from
her
engagement
,
 
because
she
thought
that
she
perceived
a
something
in
him
which
might
produce
in
him
a
desire
to
be
relieved
from
it
.
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
he
should
not
be
relieved
.
<EOS>
He
should
marry
her
.
<EOS>
And
she
would
keep
the
key
of
that
iron
box
with
the
diamonds
,
and
he
should
find
what
sort
of
a
noise
she
would
make
if
he
attempted
to
take
it
from
her
.
<EOS>
She
closed
the
morocco
case
,
ascended
with
it
to
her
bed
-
room
,
locked
it
up
in
the
iron
safe
,
deposited
the
little
patent
key
in
its
usual
place
round
her
neck
,
and
then
seated
herself
at
her
desk
,
and
wrote
letters
to
her
various
friends
,
making
known
to
them
her
engagement
.
<EOS>
Hitherto
she
had
told
no
one
but
Miss
Macnulty
,
 
and
,
in
her
doubts
,
had
gone
so
far
as
to
desire
Miss
Macnulty
not
to
mention
it
.
<EOS>
Now
she
was
resolved
to
blazon
forth
her
engagement
before
all
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
The
first
"
friend
"
to
whom
she
wrote
was
Lady
Linlithgow
.
<EOS>
The
reader
shall
see
two
or
three
of
her
letters
,
and
that
to
the
countess
shall
be
the
first
.
  
<EOS>
MY
DEAR
AUNT
,
  
<EOS>
When
you
came
to
see
me
the
other
day
,
I
can
not
say
that
you
were
very
kind
to
me
,
and
I
do
n't
suppose
you
care
very
much
what
becomes
of
me
.
<EOS>
But
I
think
it
right
to
let
you
know
that
I
am
going
to
be
married
.
<EOS>
I
am
engaged
to
Lord
Fawn
,
who
,
as
you
know
,
is
a
peer
,
and
a
member
of
Her
Majesty
's
Government
,
and
a
nobleman
of
great
influence
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
suppose
that
even
you
can
say
anything
against
such
an
alliance
.
  
<EOS>
I
am
,
your
affectionate
niece
,
  
ELI
.
<EOS>
EUSTACE
.
  
<EOS>
Then
she
wrote
to
Mrs.
Eustace
,
the
wife
of
the
Bishop
of
Bobsborough
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Eustace
had
been
very
kind
to
her
in
the
first
days
of
her
widowhood
,
and
had
fully
recognised
her
as
the
widow
of
the
head
of
her
husband
's
family
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
had
liked
none
of
the
Bobsborough
people
.
<EOS>
They
were
,
according
to
her
ideas
,
slow
,
respectable
,
and
dull
.
<EOS>
But
they
had
not
found
much
open
fault
with
her
,
and
she
was
aware
that
it
was
for
her
interest
to
remain
on
good
terms
with
them
.
<EOS>
Her
letter
,
therefore
,
to
Mrs.
Eustace
was
somewhat
less
acrid
than
that
written
to
her
aunt
Linlithgow
.
  
<EOS>
MY
DEAR
MRS
.
<EOS>
EUSTACE
,
  
<EOS>
I
hope
you
will
be
glad
to
hear
from
me
,
and
will
not
be
sorry
to
hear
my
news
.
<EOS>
I
am
going
to
be
married
again
.
<EOS>
Of
course
I
am
not
about
to
take
a
step
which
is
in
every
way
so
very
important
without
thinking
about
it
a
great
deal
.
<EOS>
But
I
am
sure
it
will
be
better
for
my
darling
little
Florian
in
every
way
;
and
as
for
myself
,
I
have
felt
for
the
last
two
years
how
unfitted
I
have
been
to
manage
everything
myself
.
<EOS>
I
have
therefore
accepted
an
offer
made
to
me
by
Lord
Fawn
,
who
is
,
as
you
know
,
a
peer
of
Parliament
,
and
a
most
distinguished
member
of
Her
Majesty
's
Government
;
and
he
is
,
too
,
a
nobleman
of
very
great
influence
in
every
respect
,
and
has
a
property
in
Ireland
,
extending
over
ever
so
many
miles
,
and
running
up
into
the
mountains
.
<EOS>
His
mansion
there
is
called
Killmage
,
but
I
am
not
sure
that
I
remember
the
name
quite
rightly
.
<EOS>
I
hope
I
may
see
you
there
some
day
,
and
the
dear
bishop
.
<EOS>
I
look
forward
with
delight
to
doing
something
to
make
those
dear
Irish
happier
.
<EOS>
The
idea
of
rambling
up
into
our
own
mountains
charms
me
,
for
nothing
suits
my
disposition
so
well
as
that
kind
of
solitude
.
  
<EOS>
Of
course
Lord
Fawn
is
not
so
rich
a
man
as
Sir
Florian
,
but
I
have
never
looked
to
riches
for
my
happiness
.
<EOS>
Not
but
what
Lord
Fawn
has
a
good
income
from
his
Irish
estates
;
and
then
,
of
course
,
he
is
paid
for
doing
Her
Majesty
's
Government
;
 
<EOS>
so
there
is
no
fear
that
he
will
have
to
live
upon
my
jointure
,
which
,
of
course
,
would
not
be
right
.
<EOS>
Pray
tell
the
dear
bishop
and
dear
Margaretta
all
this
,
with
my
love
.
<EOS>
You
will
be
happy
,
I
know
,
to
hear
that
my
little
Flo
is
quite
well
.
<EOS>
He
is
already
so
fond
of
his
new
papa
!
<EOS>
[
Lizzie
's
turn
for
lying
was
exemplified
in
this
last
statement
,
for
,
as
it
happened
,
Lord
Fawn
had
never
yet
seen
the
child
.
]
  
<EOS>
Believe
me
to
be
always
your
most
affectionate
niece
,
  
ELI
.
<EOS>
EUSTACE
.
  
<EOS>
There
were
two
other
letters
,
 
one
to
her
uncle
,
the
dean
,
and
the
other
to
her
cousin
Frank
.
<EOS>
There
was
great
doubt
in
her
mind
as
to
the
expediency
of
writing
to
Frank
Greystock
;
but
at
last
she
decided
that
she
would
do
it
.
<EOS>
The
letter
to
the
dean
need
not
be
given
in
full
,
as
it
was
very
similar
to
that
written
to
the
bishop
's
wife
.
<EOS>
The
same
mention
was
made
of
her
intended
husband
's
peerage
,
and
the
same
allusion
to
Her
Majesty
's
Government
,
 
a
phrase
which
she
had
heard
from
Lord
Fawn
himself
.
<EOS>
She
spoke
of
the
Irish
property
,
but
in
terms
less
glowing
than
she
had
used
in
writing
to
the
lady
,
and
ended
by
asking
for
her
uncle
's
congratulation
 
and
blessing
.
<EOS>
Her
letter
to
Frank
was
as
follows
,
and
,
doubtless
,
as
she
wrote
it
,
there
was
present
to
her
mind
<EOS>
a
remembrance
of
the
fact
that
he
himself
might
have
offered
to
her
,
and
have
had
her
if
he
would
.
  
<EOS>
MY
DEAR
COUSIN
,
  
<EOS>
As
I
would
rather
that
you
should
hear
my
news
from
myself
than
from
any
one
else
,
I
write
to
tell
you
that
I
am
going
to
be
married
to
Lord
Fawn
.
<EOS>
Of
course
I
know
that
there
are
certain
matters
as
to
which
you
and
Lord
Fawn
do
not
agree
,
 
in
politics
,
I
mean
;
but
still
I
do
not
doubt
<EOS>
but
you
will
think
that
he
is
quite
able
to
take
care
of
your
poor
little
cousin
.
<EOS>
It
was
only
settled
a
day
or
two
since
,
but
it
has
been
coming
on
ever
so
long
.
<EOS>
You
understand
all
about
that
;
 
do
n't
you
?
<EOS>
Of
course
you
must
come
to
my
wedding
,
and
be
very
good
to
me
,
 
a
kind
of
brother
,
you
know
;
for
we
have
always
been
friends
;
 
have
n't
we
?
<EOS>
And
if
the
dean
does
n't
come
up
to
town
,
you
must
give
me
away
.
<EOS>
And
you
must
come
and
see
me
ever
so
often
;
for
I
have
a
sort
of
feeling
that
I
have
no
one
else
belonging
to
me
that
I
can
call
really
my
own
,
except
you
.
<EOS>
And
you
must
be
great
friends
with
Lord
Fawn
,
and
must
give
up
saying
that
he
does
n't
do
his
work
properly
.
<EOS>
Of
course
he
does
everything
better
than
<EOS>
anybody
else
could
possibly
do
it
,
 
except
Cousin
Frank
.
  
<EOS>
I
am
going
down
next
week
to
Richmond
.
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
has
insisted
on
my
staying
there
for
a
fortnight
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
dear
,
what
shall
I
do
all
the
time
?
<EOS>
You
must
positively
come
down
and
see
me
,
 
and
see
somebody
else
too
!
<EOS>
Only
,
you
naughty
coz
!
<EOS>
you
must
n't
break
a
poor
girl
's
heart
.
  
<EOS>
Your
affectionate
cousin
,
  
ELI
.
<EOS>
EUSTACE
.
  
<EOS>
Somebody
,
in
speaking
on
Lady
Eustace
's
behalf
,
and
making
the
best
of
her
virtues
,
had
declared
that
she
did
not
have
lovers
.
<EOS>
Hitherto
that
had
been
true
of
her
;
 
but
her
mind
had
not
the
less
dwelt
on
the
delight
of
a
lover
.
<EOS>
She
still
thought
of
a
possible
Corsair
who
would
be
willing
to
give
up
all
but
his
vices
for
her
love
,
and
for
whose
sake
she
would
be
willing
to
share
even
them
.
<EOS>
It
was
but
a
dream
,
but
nevertheless
it
pervaded
her
fancy
constantly
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
,
 
peer
of
Parliament
,
and
member
of
Her
Majesty
's
Government
,
as
he
was
,
 
could
not
have
been
such
a
lover
to
her
.
<EOS>
Might
it
not
be
possible
that
there
should
exist
something
of
romance
between
her
and
her
cousin
Frank
?
<EOS>
She
was
the
last
woman
in
the
world
to
run
away
with
a
man
,
or
to
endanger
her
position
by
a
serious
indiscretion
;
but
there
might
,
perhaps
,
be
a
something
between
her
and
her
cousin
,
 
a
liaison
quite
correct
in
its
facts
,
a
secret
understanding
,
if
nothing
more
,
 
a
mutual
sympathy
,
which
should
be
chiefly
shown
in
the
abuse
of
all
their
friends
,
 
and
in
this
she
could
indulge
her
passion
for
romance
and
poetry
.
   
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
at
His
Office
 
<EOS>
The
news
was
soon
all
about
London
,
 
as
Lizzie
had
intended
.
<EOS>
She
had
made
a
sudden
resolve
that
Lord
Fawn
should
not
escape
her
,
and
she
had
gone
to
work
after
the
fashion
we
have
seen
.
<EOS>
Frank
Greystock
had
told
John
Eustace
,
and
John
Eustace
had
told
Mr.
Camperdown
before
Lord
Fawn
himself
,
in
the
slow
prosecution
of
his
purpose
,
had
consulted
the
lawyer
about
the
necklace
.
"
<EOS>
God
bless
my
soul
;
 
Lord
Fawn
!
"
<EOS>
the
old
lawyer
had
said
when
the
news
was
communicated
to
him
.
"
<EOS>
Well
,
 
yes
;
 
he
wants
money
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
envy
him
;
that
's
all
.
<EOS>
We
shall
get
the
diamonds
now
,
John
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
is
n't
the
man
to
let
his
wife
keep
what
does
n't
belong
to
her
.
"
<EOS>
Then
,
after
a
day
or
two
,
Lord
Fawn
had
himself
gone
to
Mr.
Camperdown
's
chambers
.
<EOS>
"
I
believe
I
am
to
congratulate
you
,
my
lord
,
"
said
the
lawyer
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
told
you
are
going
to
marry
 
;
well
,
I
must
n't
really
say
another
of
my
clients
,
but
the
widow
of
one
of
them
.
<EOS>
Lady
Eustace
is
a
very
beautiful
woman
,
and
she
has
a
very
pretty
income
too
.
<EOS>
She
has
the
whole
of
the
Scotch
property
for
her
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
only
for
her
life
,
I
suppose
?
"
said
Lord
Fawn
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
no
,
no
;
 
of
course
not
.
<EOS>
There
's
been
some
mistake
on
her
part
;
 
at
least
,
so
I
've
been
told
.
<EOS>
Women
never
understand
.
<EOS>
It
's
all
as
clear
as
daylight
.
<EOS>
Had
there
been
a
second
son
,
the
second
son
would
have
had
it
.
<EOS>
As
it
is
,
it
goes
with
the
rest
of
the
property
 
just
as
it
ought
to
do
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
Four
thousand
a
year
is
n't
so
bad
,
you
know
,
considering
that
she
is
n't
more
than
a
girl
yet
,
and
that
she
had
n't
sixpence
of
her
own
.
<EOS>
When
the
admiral
died
,
there
was
n't
sixpence
,
Lord
Fawn
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
So
I
have
heard
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
sixpence
.
<EOS>
It
's
all
Eustace
money
.
<EOS>
She
had
six
or
eight
thousand
pounds
,
or
something
like
that
,
besides
.
<EOS>
She
's
as
lovely
a
young
widow
as
I
ever
saw
,
 
and
very
clever
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
 
she
is
clever
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
By
-
the
-
bye
,
Lord
Fawn
,
as
you
have
done
me
the
honour
of
calling
,
 
there
's
a
stupid
mistake
about
some
family
diamonds
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
in
respect
to
them
that
I
've
come
,
"
said
Lord
Fawn
.
<EOS>
Then
Mr.
Camperdown
,
in
his
easy
,
off
-
hand
way
,
imputing
no
blame
to
the
lady
in
the
hearing
of
her
future
husband
,
and
declaring
his
opinion
that
she
was
doubtless
unaware
of
its
value
,
explained
the
matter
of
the
necklace
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
listened
,
but
said
very
little
.
<EOS>
He
especially
did
not
say
that
Lady
Eustace
had
had
the
stones
valued
.
<EOS>
"
They
're
real
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
he
asked
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Camperdown
assured
him
that
no
diamonds
more
real
had
ever
come
from
Golconda
,
or
passed
through
Mr.
Garnett
's
hands
.
<EOS>
"
They
are
as
well
known
as
any
family
diamonds
in
England
,
"
said
Mr.
Camperdown
.
<EOS>
"
She
has
got
into
bad
hands
,
"
 
continued
Mr.
Camperdown
.
<EOS>
"
Mowbray
and
Mopus
;
 
horrible
people
;
sharks
,
that
make
one
blush
for
one
's
profession
;
and
I
was
really
afraid
there
would
have
been
trouble
.
<EOS>
But
,
of
course
,
it
'll
be
all
right
now
;
 
and
if
she
'll
only
come
to
me
,
tell
her
I
'll
do
everything
I
can
to
make
things
straight
and
comfortable
for
her
.
<EOS>
If
she
likes
to
have
another
lawyer
,
of
course
,
that
's
all
right
.
<EOS>
Only
make
her
understand
who
Mowbray
and
Mopus
are
.
<EOS>
It
's
quite
out
of
the
question
,
Lord
Fawn
,
that
your
wife
should
have
anything
to
do
with
Mowbray
and
Mopus
.
<EOS>
"
Every
word
that
Mr.
Camperdown
said
was
gospel
to
Lord
Fawn
.
  
<EOS>
And
yet
,
as
the
reader
will
understand
,
Mr.
Camperdown
had
by
no
means
expressed
his
real
opinion
in
this
interview
.
<EOS>
He
had
spoken
of
the
widow
in
friendly
terms
,
 
declaring
that
she
was
simply
mistaken
in
her
ideas
as
to
the
duration
of
her
interest
in
the
Scotch
property
,
and
mistaken
again
about
the
diamonds
;
 
whereas
in
truth
he
regarded
her
as
a
dishonest
,
lying
,
evil
-
minded
harpy
.
<EOS>
Had
Lord
Fawn
consulted
him
simply
as
a
client
,
and
not
have
come
to
him
an
engaged
lover
,
he
would
have
expressed
his
opinion
quite
frankly
;
but
it
is
not
the
business
of
a
lawyer
to
tell
his
client
evil
things
of
the
lady
whom
that
client
is
engaged
to
marry
.
<EOS>
In
regard
to
the
property
he
spoke
the
truth
,
and
he
spoke
what
he
believed
to
be
the
truth
when
he
said
that
the
whole
thing
would
no
doubt
now
be
easily
arranged
.
<EOS>
When
Lord
Fawn
took
his
leave
,
Mr.
Camperdown
again
declared
to
himself
that
as
regarded
money
the
match
was
very
well
for
his
lordship
;
but
that
,
as
regarded
the
woman
,
Lizzie
was
dear
at
the
price
.
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
he
does
n't
mind
it
,
"
said
Mr.
Camperdown
to
himself
,
"
but
I
would
n't
marry
such
a
woman
myself
,
though
she
owned
all
Scotland
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
had
been
much
in
the
interview
to
make
Lord
Fawn
unhappy
.
<EOS>
In
the
first
place
,
that
golden
hope
as
to
the
perpetuity
of
the
property
was
at
an
end
.
<EOS>
He
had
never
believed
that
it
was
so
;
but
a
man
may
hope
without
believing
.
<EOS>
And
he
was
quite
sure
that
Lizzie
was
bound
to
give
up
the
diamonds
,
 
and
would
ultimately
be
made
to
give
them
up
.
<EOS>
Of
any
property
in
them
,
as
possibly
accruing
to
himself
,
he
had
not
thought
much
;
 
but
he
could
not
abstain
from
thinking
of
the
woman
's
grasp
upon
them
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Camperdown
's
plain
statement
,
which
was
gospel
to
him
,
was
directly
at
variance
with
Lizzie
's
story
.
<EOS>
Sir
Florian
certainly
would
not
have
given
such
diamonds
in
such
a
way
.
<EOS>
Sir
Florian
would
not
have
ordered
a
separate
iron
safe
for
them
,
with
a
view
that
they
might
be
secure
in
his
wife
's
bed
-
room
.
<EOS>
And
then
she
had
had
them
valued
,
and
manifestly
was
always
thinking
of
her
treasure
.
<EOS>
It
was
very
well
for
a
poor
,
careful
peer
to
be
always
thinking
of
his
money
,
but
Lord
Fawn
was
well
aware
that
a
young
woman
such
as
Lady
Eustace
should
have
her
thoughts
elsewhere
.
<EOS>
As
he
sat
signing
letters
at
the
India
Board
,
relieving
himself
when
he
was
left
alone
between
each
batch
by
standing
up
with
his
back
to
the
fire
-
place
,
his
mind
was
full
of
all
this
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
unravel
truth
quickly
,
but
he
could
grasp
it
when
it
came
to
him
.
<EOS>
She
was
certainly
greedy
,
false
,
and
dishonest
.
<EOS>
And
,
 
worse
than
all
this
,
 
she
had
dared
to
tell
him
to
his
face
that
he
was
a
poor
creature
because
he
would
not
support
her
in
her
greed
,
and
falsehoods
,
and
dishonesty
!
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
he
was
engaged
to
marry
her
!
<EOS>
Then
he
thought
of
one
Violet
Effingham
whom
he
had
loved
,
and
then
came
over
him
some
suspicion
of
a
fear
that
he
himself
was
hard
and
selfish
.
<EOS>
And
yet
what
was
such
a
one
as
he
to
do
?
<EOS>
It
was
of
course
necessary
for
the
maintenance
of
the
very
constitution
of
his
country
that
there
should
be
future
Lord
Fawns
.
<EOS>
There
could
be
no
future
Lord
Fawns
unless
he
married
;
 
and
how
could
he
marry
without
money
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
peasant
can
marry
whom
he
pleases
,
"
said
Lord
Fawn
,
pressing
his
hand
to
his
brow
,
and
dropping
one
flap
of
his
coat
,
as
he
thought
of
his
own
high
and
perilous
destiny
,
standing
with
his
back
to
the
fire
-
place
,
while
a
huge
pile
of
letters
lay
there
before
him
waiting
to
be
signed
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
Saturday
evening
,
and
as
there
was
no
House
<EOS>
there
was
nothing
to
hurry
him
away
from
the
office
.
<EOS>
He
was
the
occupier
for
the
time
of
a
large
,
well
-
furnished
official
room
,
looking
out
into
St.
James
's
Park
,
and
as
he
glanced
round
it
he
told
himself
that
his
own
happiness
must
be
there
,
and
not
in
the
domesticity
of
a
quiet
home
.
<EOS>
The
House
of
Lords
,
out
of
which
nobody
could
turn
him
,
and
official
life
,
 
as
long
as
he
could
hold
to
it
,
 
must
be
all
in
all
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
had
engaged
himself
to
this
woman
,
and
he
must
 
marry
her
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
think
that
he
could
now
see
any
way
of
avoiding
that
event
.
<EOS>
Her
income
would
supply
the
needs
of
her
home
,
and
then
there
might
probably
be
a
continuation
of
Lord
Fawns
.
<EOS>
The
world
might
have
done
better
for
him
,
 
had
he
been
able
to
find
favour
in
Violet
Effingham
's
sight
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
man
capable
of
love
,
 
and
very
capable
of
constancy
to
a
woman
true
to
him
.
<EOS>
Then
he
wiped
away
a
tear
as
he
sat
down
to
sign
the
huge
batch
of
letters
.
<EOS>
As
he
read
some
special
letter
in
which
instructions
were
conveyed
as
to
the
insufficiency
of
the
Sawab
's
claims
,
he
thought
of
Frank
Greystock
's
attack
upon
him
,
and
of
Frank
Greystock
's
cousin
.
<EOS>
There
had
been
a
time
in
which
he
had
feared
that
the
two
cousins
would
become
man
and
wife
.
<EOS>
At
this
moment
he
uttered
a
malediction
against
the
member
for
Bobsborough
,
which
might
perhaps
have
been
spared
had
the
member
been
now
willing
to
take
the
lady
off
his
hands
.
<EOS>
Then
the
door
was
opened
,
and
the
messenger
told
him
that
Mrs.
Hittaway
was
in
the
waiting
-
room
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Hittaway
was
,
of
course
,
at
once
made
welcome
to
the
Under
-
Secretary
's
own
apartment
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Hittaway
was
a
strong
-
minded
woman
,
 
<EOS>
the
strongest
-
minded
probably
of
the
Fawn
family
,
 
but
<EOS>
she
had
now
come
upon
a
task
which
taxed
all
her
strength
to
the
utmost
.
<EOS>
She
had
told
her
mother
that
she
would
tell
"
Frederic
"
what
she
thought
about
his
proposed
bride
,
and
she
had
now
come
to
carry
out
her
threat
.
<EOS>
She
had
asked
her
brother
to
come
and
dine
with
her
,
but
he
had
declined
.
<EOS>
His
engagements
hardly
admitted
of
his
dining
with
his
relatives
.
<EOS>
She
had
called
upon
him
at
the
rooms
he
occupied
in
Victoria
Street
,
 
but
of
course
she
had
not
found
him
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
very
well
go
to
his
club
;
 
so
now
she
had
hunted
him
down
at
his
office
.
<EOS>
From
the
very
commencement
of
the
interview
Mrs.
Hittaway
was
strong
-
minded
.
<EOS>
She
began
the
subject
of
the
marriage
,
and
did
so
without
a
word
of
congratulation
.
"
<EOS>
Dear
Frederic
,
"
she
said
,
"
you
know
that
we
have
all
got
to
look
up
to
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Clara
,
 
what
does
that
mean
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
means
this
,
 
that
you
must
bear
with
me
,
if
I
am
more
anxious
as
to
your
future
career
than
another
sister
might
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Now
I
know
you
are
going
to
say
something
unpleasant
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
am
,
Frederic
.
<EOS>
I
have
heard
so
many
bad
things
about
Lady
Eustace
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
Under
-
Secretary
sat
silent
for
awhile
in
his
great
arm
-
chair
.
<EOS>
"
What
sort
of
evil
things
do
you
mean
,
Clara
?
"
he
asked
at
last
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Evil
things
are
said
of
a
great
many
people
,
 
as
you
know
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
you
would
not
wish
to
repeat
slanders
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Hittaway
was
not
to
be
silenced
after
this
fashion
.
<EOS>
"
Not
slanders
,
certainly
,
Frederic
.
<EOS>
But
when
I
hear
that
you
intend
to
raise
this
lady
to
the
rank
and
position
of
your
wife
,
then
of
course
the
truth
or
falsehood
of
these
reports
becomes
a
matter
of
great
moment
to
us
all
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
think
you
had
better
see
Mr.
Camperdown
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
seen
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
does
he
say
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
should
he
say
?
<EOS>
Lady
Eustace
has
,
I
believe
,
made
some
mistake
about
the
condition
of
her
property
,
and
people
who
have
heard
it
have
been
good
-
natured
enough
to
say
that
the
error
has
been
wilful
.
<EOS>
That
is
what
I
call
slander
,
Clara

"
  
"
And
have
you
heard
about
her
jewels
?
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Hittaway
was
alluding
here
to
the
report
which
had
reached
her
as
to
Lizzie
's
debt
to
Harter
and
Benjamin
when
she
married
Sir
Florian
;
but
Lord
Fawn
of
course
thought
of
the
diamond
necklace
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
"
said
he
,
"
I
have
heard
all
about
them
.
<EOS>
Who
told
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
known
it
ever
so
long
.
<EOS>
Sir
Florian
never
got
over
it
.
"
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
was
again
in
the
dark
,
but
he
did
not
choose
to
commit
himself
by
asking
further
questions
.
"
<EOS>
And
then
her
treatment
of
Lady
Linlithgow
,
who
was
her
only
friend
before
she
married
,
was
something
quite
unnatural
.
<EOS>
Ask
the
dean
's
people
what
they
think
of
her
.
<EOS>
I
believe
even
they
would
tell
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Frank
Greystock
desired
to
marry
her
himself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
 
for
her
money
,
perhaps
;
 
because
he
has
not
got
a
farthing
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
Dear
Frederic
,
I
only
wish
to
put
you
on
your
guard
.
<EOS>
Of
course
this
is
very
unpleasant
,
and
I
should
n't
do
it
if
I
did
n't
think
it
my
duty
.
<EOS>
I
believe
she
is
artful
and
very
false
.
<EOS>
She
certainly
deceived
Sir
Florian
Eustace
about
her
debts
;
 
and
he
never
held
up
his
head
after
he
found
out
what
she
was
.
<EOS>
If
she
has
told
you
falsehoods
,
of
course
you
can
break
it
off
.
<EOS>
Dear
Frederic
,
I
hope
you
wo
n't
be
angry
with
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
that
all
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
 
that
is
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
bear
it
in
mind
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
Of
course
it
is
n't
very
pleasant
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
 
I
know
it
is
not
pleasant
,
"
said
Mrs.
Hittaway
,
rising
,
and
taking
her
departure
with
an
offer
of
affectionate
sisterly
greeting
,
which
was
not
accepted
with
cordiality
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
very
unpleasant
.
<EOS>
That
very
morning
Lord
Fawn
had
received
letters
from
the
Dean
and
the
Bishop
of
Bobsborough
congratulating
him
on
his
intended
marriage
,
 
both
those
worthy
dignitaries
of
the
Church
having
thought
it
expedient
to
verify
Lizzie
's
statements
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
was
,
therefore
,
well
aware
that
Lady
Eustace
had
published
the
engagement
.
<EOS>
It
was
known
to
everybody
,
and
could
not
be
broken
off
without
public
scandal
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
Only
Thought
of
It
"
 
There
was
great
perturbation
down
at
Fawn
Court
.
<EOS>
On
the
day
fixed
,
Monday
,
June
5
,
Lizzie
arrived
.
<EOS>
Nothing
further
had
been
said
by
Lady
Fawn
to
urge
the
invitation
;
but
,
in
accordance
with
the
arrangement
already
made
,
Lady
Eustace
,
with
her
child
,
her
nurse
,
and
her
own
maid
,
was
at
Fawn
Court
by
four
o'clock
.
<EOS>
A
very
long
letter
had
been
received
from
Mrs.
Hittaway
that
morning
,
 
the
writing
of
which
must
have
seriously
interfered
with
the
tranquillity
of
her
Sunday
afternoon
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
did
not
make
his
appearance
at
Richmond
on
the
Saturday
evening
,
 
nor
was
he
seen
on
the
Sunday
.
<EOS>
That
Sunday
was
,
we
may
presume
,
chiefly
devoted
to
reflection
.
<EOS>
He
certainly
did
not
call
upon
his
future
wife
.
<EOS>
His
omission
to
do
so
no
doubt
increased
Lizzie
's
urgency
in
the
matter
of
her
visit
to
Richmond
.
<EOS>
Frank
Greystock
had
written
to
congratulate
her
.
"
<EOS>
Dear
Frank
,
"
she
had
said
in
reply
,
"
a
woman
situated
as
I
am
has
so
many
things
to
think
of
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
's
position
will
be
of
service
to
my
child
.
<EOS>
Mind
you
come
and
see
me
at
Fawn
Court
.
<EOS>
I
count
so
much
on
your
friendship
and
assistance
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Of
course
she
was
expected
at
Richmond
,
 
<EOS>
although
throughout
the
morning
Lady
Fawn
had
entertained
almost
a
hope
that
she
would
n't
come
.
"
<EOS>
He
was
only
lukewarm
in
defending
her
,
"
Mrs.
Hittaway
had
said
in
her
letter
,
"
and
I
still
think
that
there
may
be
an
escape
.
<EOS>
"
Not
even
a
note
had
come
from
Lord
Fawn
himself
,
 
nor
from
Lady
Eustace
.
<EOS>
Possibly
something
violent
might
have
been
done
,
and
Lady
Eustace
would
not
appear
.
<EOS>
But
Lady
Eustace
did
appear
,
 
and
,
after
a
fashion
,
was
made
welcome
at
Fawn
Court
.
  
<EOS>
The
Fawn
ladies
were
not
good
hypocrites
.
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
had
said
almost
nothing
to
her
daughters
of
her
visit
to
Mount
Street
,
but
Augusta
had
heard
the
discussion
in
Mrs.
Hittaway
's
drawing
-
room
as
to
the
character
of
the
future
bride
.
<EOS>
The
coming
visit
had
been
spoken
of
almost
with
awe
,
and
there
was
a
general
conviction
in
the
dovecote
that
an
evil
thing
had
fallen
upon
them
.
<EOS>
Consequently
,
their
affection
to
the
new
-
comer
,
though
spoken
in
words
,
was
not
made
evident
by
signs
and
manners
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
herself
took
care
that
the
position
in
which
she
was
received
should
be
sufficiently
declared
.
<EOS>
"
It
seems
so
odd
that
I
am
to
come
among
you
as
a
sister
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
The
girls
were
forced
to
assent
to
the
claim
,
but
they
assented
coldly
.
"
<EOS>
He
has
told
me
to
attach
myself
especially
to
you
,
"
she
whispered
to
Augusta
.
<EOS>
The
unfortunate
chosen
one
,
who
had
but
little
strength
of
her
own
,
accepted
the
position
,
and
then
,
as
the
only
means
of
escaping
the
embraces
of
her
newly
-
found
sister
,
pleaded
the
violence
of
a
headache
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
mother
!
"
said
Lizzie
to
Lady
Fawn
.
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Lady
Fawn
.
<EOS>
"
One
of
the
girls
had
perhaps
better
go
up
and
show
you
your
room
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
much
afraid
about
it
,
"
said
Lady
Fawn
to
her
daughter
Amelia
.
<EOS>
Amelia
replied
only
by
shaking
her
head
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
Tuesday
morning
there
came
a
note
from
Lord
Fawn
to
his
lady
-
love
.
<EOS>
Of
course
the
letter
was
not
shown
,
but
Lizzie
received
it
at
the
breakfast
table
,
and
read
it
with
many
little
smiles
and
signs
of
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
And
then
she
gave
out
various
little
statements
as
having
been
made
in
that
letter
.
<EOS>
He
says
this
,
and
he
says
that
,
and
he
is
coming
here
,
and
going
there
,
and
he
will
do
one
thing
,
and
he
wo
n't
do
the
other
.
<EOS>
We
have
often
seen
young
ladies
crowing
over
their
lovers
"
letters
,
and
it
was
pleasant
to
see
Lizzie
crowing
over
hers
.
<EOS>
And
yet
there
was
but
very
little
in
the
letter
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
told
her
that
what
with
the
House
and
what
with
the
Office
,
he
could
not
get
down
to
Richmond
before
Saturday
;
but
that
on
Saturday
he
would
come
.
<EOS>
Then
he
signed
himself
"
yours
affectionately
,
Fawn
.
<EOS>
"
Lizzie
did
her
crowing
very
prettily
.
<EOS>
The
outward
show
of
it
was
there
to
perfection
,
 
so
that
the
Fawn
girls
really
believed
that
their
brother
had
written
an
affectionate
lover
's
letter
.
<EOS>
Inwardly
,
Lizzie
swore
to
herself
,
as
she
read
the
cold
words
with
indignation
,
that
the
man
should
not
escape
her
.
  
<EOS>
The
days
went
by
very
tediously
.
<EOS>
On
the
Wednesday
and
the
Friday
Lady
Eustace
made
an
excuse
of
going
up
to
town
,
and
insisted
on
taking
the
unfortunate
Augusta
with
her
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
real
reason
for
these
journeys
to
London
,
 
unless
that
glance
which
on
each
occasion
was
given
to
the
contents
of
the
iron
case
was
a
real
reason
.
<EOS>
The
diamonds
were
safe
,
and
Miss
Macnulty
was
enjoying
herself
.
<EOS>
On
the
Friday
Lizzie
proposed
to
Augusta
that
they
should
jointly
make
a
raid
upon
the
member
of
Her
Majesty
's
Government
at
his
office
;
but
Augusta
positively
refused
to
take
such
a
step
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
he
would
be
angry
,
"
pleaded
Augusta
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Psha
!
<EOS>
who
cares
for
his
anger
?
"
said
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
But
the
visit
was
not
made
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
Saturday
,
 
the
Saturday
which
was
to
bring
Lord
Fawn
down
to
dinner
,
 
another
most
unexpected
visitor
made
his
appearance
.
<EOS>
At
about
three
o'clock
Frank
Greystock
was
at
Fawn
Court
.
<EOS>
Now
it
was
certainly
understood
that
Mr.
Greystock
had
been
told
not
to
come
to
Fawn
Court
as
long
as
Lucy
Morris
was
there
.
"
<EOS>
Dear
Mr.
Greystock
,
I
'm
sure
you
will
take
what
I
say
as
I
mean
it
,
"
Lady
Fawn
had
whispered
to
him
.
<EOS>
"
You
know
how
attached
we
all
are
to
our
dear
little
Lucy
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
you
know
 
.
<EOS>
"
There
had
been
more
of
it
;
but
the
meaning
of
it
all
was
undoubtedly
this
,
 
that
Frank
was
not
to
pay
visits
to
Lucy
Morris
at
Fawn
Court
.
<EOS>
Now
he
had
come
to
see
his
cousin
Lizzie
Eustace
.
  
<EOS>
On
this
occasion
Lady
Fawn
,
with
Amelia
and
two
of
the
other
girls
,
were
out
in
the
carriage
.
<EOS>
The
unfortunate
Augusta
had
been
left
at
home
with
her
bosom
friend
;
 
while
Cecilia
and
Nina
were
supposed
to
be
talking
French
with
Lucy
Morris
.
<EOS>
They
were
all
out
in
the
grounds
,
sitting
upon
the
benches
,
and
rambling
among
the
shrubberies
,
when
of
a
sudden
Frank
Greystock
was
in
the
midst
of
them
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
's
expression
of
joy
at
seeing
her
cousin
was
almost
as
great
as
though
he
had
been
in
fact
a
brother
.
<EOS>
She
ran
up
to
him
and
grasped
his
hand
,
and
hung
on
his
arm
,
and
looked
up
into
his
face
,
and
then
burst
into
tears
.
<EOS>
But
the
tears
were
not
violent
tears
.
<EOS>
There
were
just
three
sobs
,
and
two
bright
eyes
full
of
water
,
and
a
lace
handkerchief
,
 
and
then
a
smile
.
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Frank
,
"
she
said
,
"
it
does
make
one
think
so
of
old
times
!
"
<EOS>
Augusta
had
by
this
time
been
almost
persuaded
to
believe
in
her
,
 
though
the
belief
by
no
means
made
the
poor
young
woman
happy
.
<EOS>
Frank
thought
that
his
cousin
looked
very
well
,
and
said
something
as
to
Lord
Fawn
being
"
the
happiest
fellow
going
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
hope
I
shall
make
him
happy
,
"
said
Lizzie
,
clasping
her
hands
together
.
  
<EOS>
Lucy
meanwhile
was
standing
in
the
circle
with
the
others
.
<EOS>
It
never
occurred
to
her
that
it
was
her
duty
to
run
away
from
the
man
she
loved
.
<EOS>
She
had
shaken
hands
with
him
,
and
felt
something
of
affection
in
his
pressure
.
<EOS>
She
did
believe
that
his
visit
was
made
entirely
to
his
cousin
,
and
had
no
idea
at
the
moment
of
disobeying
Lady
Fawn
.
<EOS>
During
the
last
few
days
she
had
been
thrown
very
much
with
her
old
friend
Lizzie
,
and
had
been
treated
by
the
future
peeress
with
many
signs
of
almost
sisterly
affection
.
"
<EOS>
Dear
Lucy
,
"
Lizzie
had
said
,
"
you
can
understand
me
.
<EOS>
These
people
,
 
oh
,
they
are
so
good
,
but
they
ca
n't
understand
me
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Lucy
had
expressed
a
hope
that
Lord
Fawn
understood
her
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
Lord
Fawn
,
 
well
;
<EOS>
yes
;
perhaps
;
 
I
do
n't
know
.
<EOS>
It
so
often
happens
that
one
's
husband
is
the
last
person
to
understand
one
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
thought
so
,
I
would
n't
marry
him
,
"
said
Lucy
.
  
<EOS>
"
Frank
Greystock
will
understand
you
,
"
said
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
It
was
indeed
true
that
Lucy
did
understand
something
of
her
wealthy
friend
's
character
,
and
was
almost
ashamed
of
the
friendship
.
<EOS>
With
Lizzie
Greystock
she
had
never
sympathised
,
and
Lizzie
Eustace
had
always
been
distasteful
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
already
felt
that
the
less
she
should
see
of
Lizzie
Fawn
the
better
she
should
like
it
.
  
<EOS>
Before
an
hour
was
over
,
Frank
Greystock
was
walking
round
the
shrubberies
with
Lucy
,
 
and
was
walking
with
Lucy
alone
.
<EOS>
It
was
undoubtedly
the
fact
that
Lady
Eustace
had
contrived
that
it
should
be
so
.
<EOS>
The
unfitness
of
the
thing
recommended
it
to
her
.
<EOS>
Frank
could
hardly
marry
a
wife
without
a
shilling
.
<EOS>
Lucy
would
certainly
not
think
at
all
of
shillings
.
<EOS>
Frank
,
 
as
Lizzie
knew
,
 
had
been
almost
at
her
feet
within
the
last
fortnight
,
and
might
,
in
some
possible
emergency
,
be
there
again
.
<EOS>
In
the
midst
of
such
circumstances
nothing
could
be
better
than
that
Frank
and
Lucy
should
be
thrown
together
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
regarded
all
this
as
romance
.
<EOS>
Poor
Lady
Fawn
,
had
she
known
it
all
,
would
have
called
it
diabolical
wickedness
and
inhuman
cruelty
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Lucy
;
 
<EOS>
what
do
you
think
of
it
?
"
<EOS>
Frank
Greystock
said
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Think
of
what
,
Mr.
Greystock
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
what
I
mean
;
 
this
marriage
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
should
I
be
able
to
think
?
<EOS>
I
have
never
seen
them
together
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
Lord
Fawn
is
n't
very
rich
.
<EOS>
She
is
rich
.
<EOS>
And
then
she
is
very
beautiful
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
think
her
very
beautiful
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sometimes
exquisitely
lovely
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Everybody
says
so
;
 
and
I
am
sure
it
is
the
fact
.
<EOS>
Do
you
know
;
 
<EOS>
but
perhaps
you
'll
think
I
am
envious
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
thought
you
envious
of
Lizzie
,
I
should
have
to
think
you
very
foolish
at
the
same
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
what
that
means
;
"
 
she
did
know
well
enough
what
it
meant
;
 
"
but
sometimes
to
me
she
is
almost
frightful
to
look
at
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
In
what
way
?
"
  
"
Oh
,
I
ca
n't
tell
you
.
<EOS>
She
looks
like
a
beautiful
animal
that
you
are
afraid
to
caress
for
fear
it
should
bite
you
;
 
an
animal
that
would
be
beautiful
if
its
eyes
were
not
so
restless
,
and
its
teeth
so
sharp
and
so
white
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
very
odd
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
odd
,
Mr.
Greystock
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Because
I
feel
exactly
in
the
same
way
about
her
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
in
the
least
afraid
that
she
'll
bite
me
;
and
as
for
caressing
the
animal
,
 
that
kind
of
caressing
which
you
mean
,
 
it
seems
to
me
to
be
just
what
she
's
made
for
.
<EOS>
But
,
I
do
feel
sometimes
,
that
she
is
like
a
cat
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Something
not
quite
so
tame
as
a
cat
,
"
said
Lucy
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nevertheless
she
is
very
lovely
,
 
and
very
clever
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
I
think
her
the
most
beautiful
woman
I
ever
saw
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
you
,
indeed
?
"
  
"
She
will
be
immensely
run
after
as
Lady
Fawn
.
<EOS>
When
she
pleases
she
can
make
her
own
house
quite
charming
.
<EOS>
I
never
knew
a
woman
who
could
say
pretty
things
to
so
many
people
at
once
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
making
her
out
to
be
a
paragon
of
perfection
,
Mr.
Greystock
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
when
you
add
to
all
the
rest
that
she
has
four
thousand
a
year
,
you
must
admit
that
Lord
Fawn
is
a
lucky
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
said
nothing
against
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Four
thousand
a
year
is
a
very
great
consideration
,
Lucy
.
<EOS>
"
Lucy
for
a
while
said
nothing
.
<EOS>
She
was
making
up
her
mind
that
she
would
say
nothing
;
 
that
she
would
make
no
reply
indicative
of
any
feeling
on
her
part
.
<EOS>
But
she
was
not
sufficiently
strong
to
keep
her
resolution
.
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
,
Mr.
Greystock
,
"
she
said
,
"
that
you
did
not
attempt
to
win
the
great
prize
yourself
.
<EOS>
Cousins
do
marry
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
had
thought
of
attempting
it
,
and
at
this
moment
he
would
not
lie
to
her
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
cousinship
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
,
"
he
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
you
did
think
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
,
Lucy
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
I
did
.
<EOS>
Thank
God
,
I
only
thought
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
She
could
not
refrain
herself
from
looking
up
into
his
face
and
clasping
her
hands
together
.
<EOS>
A
woman
never
so
dearly
loves
a
man
as
when
he
confesses
that
he
has
been
on
the
brink
of
a
great
crime
,
 
but
has
refrained
,
and
has
not
committed
it
.
<EOS>
"
I
did
think
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
telling
you
that
she
would
have
taken
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
reason
whatever
for
thinking
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
she
would
,
"
said
Lucy
,
who
did
not
in
the
least
know
what
words
she
was
uttering
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
would
have
been
simply
for
her
money
,
 
her
money
and
her
beauty
.
<EOS>
It
would
not
have
been
because
I
love
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Never
 
never
ask
a
girl
to
marry
you
,
unless
you
love
her
,
Mr.
Greystock
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
there
is
only
one
that
I
can
ever
ask
,
"
said
he
.
<EOS>
There
was
nothing
of
course
that
she
could
say
to
this
.
<EOS>
If
he
did
not
choose
to
go
further
,
she
was
not
bound
to
understand
him
.
<EOS>
But
would
he
go
further
?
<EOS>
She
felt
at
the
moment
that
an
open
declaration
of
his
love
to
herself
would
make
her
happy
for
ever
,
even
though
it
should
be
accompanied
by
an
assurance
that
he
could
not
marry
her
.
<EOS>
If
they
only
knew
each
other
,
 
that
it
was
so
between
them
,
 
that
,
she
thought
,
would
be
enough
for
her
.
<EOS>
And
as
for
him
 
if
a
woman
could
bear
such
a
position
,
surely
he
might
bear
it
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Do
you
know
who
that
one
is
?
"
he
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
she
said
,
 
shaking
her
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
Lucy
,
is
that
true
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
does
it
matter
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Lucy
;
 
look
at
me
,
Lucy
,
"
and
he
put
his
hand
upon
her
arm
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
 
no
,
 
no
!
"
she
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
love
you
so
well
,
Lucy
,
that
I
never
can
love
another
.
<EOS>
I
have
thought
of
many
women
,
but
could
never
even
think
of
one
,
as
a
woman
to
love
,
except
you
.
<EOS>
I
have
sometimes
fancied
I
could
marry
for
money
and
position
,
 
to
help
myself
on
in
the
world
by
means
of
a
wife
,
 
but
when
my
mind
has
run
away
with
me
,
to
revel
amidst
ideas
of
feminine
sweetness
,
you
have
always
 
always
been
the
heroine
of
the
tale
,
as
the
mistress
of
the
happy
castle
in
the
air
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Have
I
?
"
<EOS>
she
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
Always
,
 
always
.
<EOS>
As
regards
this
,
"
 
and
he
struck
himself
on
the
breast
,
 
"
no
man
was
ever
more
constant
.
<EOS>
Though
I
do
n't
think
much
of
myself
as
a
man
,
I
know
a
woman
when
I
see
her
.
<EOS>
"
But
he
did
not
ask
her
to
be
his
wife
;
 
nor
did
he
wait
at
Fawn
Court
till
Lady
Fawn
had
come
back
with
the
carriage
.
   
<EOS>
Showing
<EOS>
What
Frank
Greystock
<EOS>
Did
 
Frank
Greystock
escaped
from
the
dovecote
before
Lady
Fawn
had
returned
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
made
his
visit
to
Richmond
with
any
purpose
of
seeing
Lucy
Morris
,
or
of
saying
to
her
when
he
did
see
her
anything
special
,
 
of
saying
anything
that
should
,
or
anything
that
should
not
,
have
been
said
.
<EOS>
He
had
gone
there
,
in
truth
,
simply
because
his
cousin
had
asked
him
,
and
because
it
was
almost
a
duty
on
his
part
to
see
his
cousin
on
the
momentous
occasion
of
this
new
engagement
.
<EOS>
But
he
had
declared
to
himself
that
old
Lady
Fawn
was
a
fool
,
and
that
to
see
Lucy
again
would
be
very
pleasant
.
"
<EOS>
See
her
;
 
<EOS>
of
course
I
'll
see
her
,
"
he
had
said
.
<EOS>
"
Why
should
I
be
prevented
from
seeing
her
?
"
<EOS>
Now
he
had
seen
her
,
and
as
he
returned
by
the
train
to
London
,
he
acknowledged
to
himself
that
it
was
no
longer
in
his
power
to
promote
his
fortune
by
marriage
.
<EOS>
He
had
at
last
said
that
to
Lucy
which
made
it
impossible
for
him
to
offer
his
hand
to
any
other
woman
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
,
in
truth
,
asked
her
to
be
his
wife
;
but
he
had
told
her
that
he
loved
her
,
and
could
never
love
any
other
woman
.
<EOS>
He
had
asked
for
no
answer
to
this
assurance
,
and
then
he
had
left
her
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
course
of
that
afternoon
he
did
question
himself
as
to
his
conduct
to
this
girl
,
and
subjected
himself
to
some
of
the
rigours
of
a
cross
-
examination
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
a
man
who
could
think
of
a
girl
as
the
one
human
being
whom
he
loved
above
all
others
,
and
yet
look
forward
with
equanimity
to
the
idea
of
doing
her
an
injury
.
<EOS>
He
could
understand
that
a
man
unable
to
marry
should
be
reticent
as
to
his
feelings
,
 
supposing
him
to
have
been
weak
enough
to
have
succumbed
to
a
passion
which
could
only
mar
his
own
prospects
.
<EOS>
He
was
frank
enough
in
owning
to
himself
that
he
had
been
thus
weak
.
<EOS>
The
weakness
had
come
upon
himself
early
in
life
,
 
and
was
there
,
an
established
fact
.
<EOS>
The
girl
was
to
him
unlike
any
other
girl
;
 
or
any
man
.
<EOS>
There
was
to
him
a
sweetness
in
her
companionship
which
he
could
not
analyse
.
<EOS>
She
was
not
beautiful
.
<EOS>
She
had
none
of
the
charms
of
fashion
.
<EOS>
He
had
never
seen
her
well
-
dressed
,
 
according
to
the
ideas
of
dress
which
he
found
to
be
prevailing
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
She
was
a
little
thing
,
who
,
as
a
man
's
wife
,
could
attract
no
attention
by
figure
,
form
,
or
outward
manner
,
 
one
who
had
quietly
submitted
herself
to
the
position
of
a
governess
,
and
who
did
not
seem
to
think
that
in
doing
so
she
obtained
less
than
her
due
.
<EOS>
But
yet
he
knew
her
to
be
better
than
all
the
rest
.
<EOS>
For
him
,
at
any
rate
,
she
was
better
than
all
the
rest
.
<EOS>
Her
little
hand
was
cool
and
sweet
to
him
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
when
he
was
heated
and
hard
at
work
,
he
would
fancy
how
it
would
be
with
him
if
she
were
by
him
,
and
would
lay
it
on
his
brow
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
sparkle
in
her
eye
that
had
to
him
more
of
sympathy
in
it
than
could
be
conveyed
by
all
the
other
eyes
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
There
was
an
expression
in
her
mouth
when
she
smiled
,
which
was
more
eloquent
to
him
than
any
sound
.
<EOS>
There
were
a
reality
and
a
truth
about
her
which
came
home
to
him
,
and
made
themselves
known
to
him
as
firm
rocks
which
could
not
be
shaken
.
<EOS>
He
had
never
declared
to
himself
that
deceit
or
hypocrisy
in
a
woman
was
especially
abominable
.
<EOS>
As
a
rule
he
looked
for
it
in
women
,
and
would
say
that
some
amount
of
affectation
was
necessary
to
a
woman
's
character
.
<EOS>
He
knew
that
his
cousin
Lizzie
was
a
little
liar
,
 
that
she
was
,
as
Lucy
had
said
,
a
pretty
animal
that
would
turn
and
bite
;
 
and
yet
he
liked
his
cousin
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
want
women
to
be
perfect
,
 
so
he
would
say
.
<EOS>
But
Lucy
Morris
,
in
his
eyes
,
was
perfect
;
and
when
he
told
her
that
she
was
ever
the
queen
who
reigned
in
those
castles
in
the
air
which
he
built
,
 
as
others
build
them
,
he
told
her
no
more
than
the
truth
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
fallen
into
these
feelings
and
could
not
now
avoid
them
,
or
be
quit
of
them
;
 
but
he
could
have
been
silent
respecting
them
.
<EOS>
He
knew
that
in
former
days
,
down
at
Bobsborough
,
he
had
not
been
altogether
silent
.
<EOS>
When
he
had
first
seen
her
at
Fawn
Court
he
had
not
been
altogether
silent
.
<EOS>
But
he
had
been
warned
away
from
Fawn
Court
,
and
in
that
very
warning
there
was
conveyed
,
as
it
were
,
an
absolution
from
the
effect
of
words
hitherto
spoken
.
<EOS>
Though
he
had
called
Lady
Fawn
an
old
fool
,
he
had
known
that
it
was
so
,
 
had
,
after
a
fashion
,
perceived
her
wisdom
,
 
and
had
regarded
himself
as
a
man
free
to
decide
,
without
disgrace
,
that
he
might
abandon
ideas
of
ecstatic
love
and
look
out
for
a
rich
wife
.
<EOS>
Presuming
himself
to
be
reticent
for
the
future
in
reference
to
his
darling
Lucy
,
he
might
do
as
he
pleased
with
himself
.
<EOS>
Thus
there
had
come
a
moment
in
which
he
had
determined
that
he
would
ask
his
rich
cousin
to
marry
him
.
<EOS>
In
that
little
project
he
had
been
interrupted
,
and
the
reader
knows
what
had
come
of
it
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
's
success
had
not
in
the
least
annoyed
him
.
<EOS>
He
had
only
half
resolved
in
regard
to
his
cousin
.
<EOS>
She
was
very
beautiful
no
doubt
,
and
there
was
her
income
;
 
but
he
also
knew
that
those
teeth
would
bite
and
that
those
claws
would
scratch
.
<EOS>
But
Lord
Fawn
's
success
had
given
a
turn
to
his
thoughts
,
and
had
made
him
think
,
for
a
moment
,
that
if
a
man
loved
,
he
should
be
true
to
his
love
.
<EOS>
The
reader
also
knows
what
had
come
of
that
,
 
how
at
last
he
had
not
been
reticent
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
asked
Lucy
to
be
his
wife
;
but
he
had
said
that
which
made
it
impossible
that
he
should
marry
any
other
woman
without
dishonour
.
  
<EOS>
As
he
thought
of
what
he
had
done
himself
,
he
tried
to
remember
whether
Lucy
had
said
a
word
expressive
of
affection
for
himself
.
<EOS>
She
had
in
truth
spoken
very
few
words
,
and
he
could
remember
almost
every
one
of
them
.
"
<EOS>
Have
I
?
"
 
<EOS>
she
had
asked
,
when
he
told
her
that
she
had
ever
been
the
princess
reigning
in
his
castles
.
<EOS>
And
there
had
been
a
joy
in
the
question
which
she
had
not
attempted
to
conceal
.
<EOS>
She
had
hesitated
not
at
all
.
<EOS>
She
had
not
told
him
that
she
loved
him
.
<EOS>
But
there
had
been
something
sweeter
than
such
protestation
in
the
question
she
had
asked
him
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Is
it
indeed
true
,
"
she
had
said
,
"
that
I
have
been
placed
there
where
all
my
joy
and
all
my
glory
lies
?
<EOS>
"
It
was
not
in
her
to
tell
a
lie
to
him
,
even
by
a
tone
.
<EOS>
She
had
intended
to
say
nothing
of
her
love
,
but
he
knew
that
it
had
all
been
told
.
<EOS>
"
Have
I
?
"
 
<EOS>
he
repeated
the
words
to
himself
a
dozen
times
,
and
as
he
did
so
,
he
could
hear
her
voice
.
<EOS>
Certainly
there
never
was
a
voice
that
brought
home
to
the
hearer
so
strong
a
sense
of
its
own
truth
!
  
<EOS>
Why
should
he
not
at
once
make
up
his
mind
to
marry
her
?
<EOS>
He
could
do
it
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
doubt
of
that
.
<EOS>
It
was
possible
for
him
to
alter
the
whole
manner
of
his
life
,
to
give
up
his
clubs
,
 
to
give
up
even
Parliament
,
if
the
need
to
do
so
was
there
,
 
and
to
live
as
a
married
man
on
the
earnings
of
his
profession
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
need
why
he
should
regard
himself
as
a
poor
man
.
<EOS>
Two
things
,
no
doubt
,
were
against
his
regarding
himself
as
a
rich
man
.
<EOS>
Ever
since
he
had
commenced
life
in
London
he
had
been
more
or
less
in
debt
;
and
then
,
unfortunately
,
he
had
acquired
a
seat
in
Parliament
at
a
period
of
his
career
in
which
the
dangers
of
such
a
position
were
greater
than
the
advantages
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
he
could
earn
an
income
on
which
he
and
his
wife
,
were
he
to
marry
,
could
live
in
all
comfort
;
and
as
to
his
debts
,
if
he
would
set
his
shoulder
to
the
work
they
might
be
paid
off
in
a
twelvemonth
.
<EOS>
There
was
nothing
in
the
prospect
which
would
frighten
Lucy
,
though
there
might
be
a
question
whether
he
possessed
the
courage
needed
for
so
violent
a
change
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
chambers
in
the
Temple
;
he
lived
in
rooms
which
he
hired
from
month
to
month
in
one
of
the
big
hotels
at
the
West
End
;
and
he
dined
at
his
club
,
or
at
the
House
,
when
he
was
not
dining
with
a
friend
.
<EOS>
It
was
an
expensive
and
a
luxurious
mode
of
life
,
 
and
one
from
the
effects
of
which
a
man
is
prone
to
drift
very
quickly
into
selfishness
.
<EOS>
He
was
by
no
means
given
to
drinking
,
 
<EOS>
but
he
was
already
learning
to
like
good
wine
.
<EOS>
Small
economies
in
reference
to
cab
-
hire
,
gloves
,
umbrellas
,
and
railway
fares
were
unknown
to
him
.
<EOS>
Sixpences
and
shillings
were
things
with
which
,
in
his
mind
,
it
was
grievous
to
have
to
burden
the
thoughts
.
<EOS>
The
Greystocks
had
all
lived
after
that
fashion
.
<EOS>
Even
the
dean
himself
was
not
free
from
the
charge
of
extravagance
.
<EOS>
All
this
Frank
knew
,
and
he
did
not
hesitate
to
tell
himself
,
that
he
must
make
a
great
change
if
he
meant
to
marry
Lucy
Morris
.
<EOS>
And
he
was
wise
enough
to
know
that
the
change
would
become
more
difficult
every
day
that
it
was
postponed
.
<EOS>
Hitherto
the
question
had
been
an
open
question
with
him
.
<EOS>
Could
it
now
be
an
open
question
any
longer
?
<EOS>
As
a
man
of
honour
,
was
he
not
bound
to
share
his
lot
with
Lucy
Morris
?
  
<EOS>
That
evening
,
 
that
Saturday
evening
,
 
it
so
happened
that
he
met
John
Eustace
at
a
club
to
which
they
both
belonged
,
and
they
dined
together
.
<EOS>
They
had
long
known
each
other
,
and
had
been
thrown
into
closer
intimacy
by
the
marriage
between
Sir
Florian
and
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
John
Eustace
had
never
been
fond
of
Lizzie
,
and
now
,
in
truth
,
liked
her
less
than
ever
;
but
he
did
like
Lizzie
's
cousin
,
and
felt
that
possibly
Frank
might
be
of
use
to
him
in
the
growing
difficulty
of
managing
the
heir
's
property
and
looking
after
the
heir
's
interests
.
<EOS>
"
You
've
let
the
widow
slip
through
your
fingers
,
"
he
said
to
Frank
,
as
they
sat
together
at
the
table
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
told
you
Lord
Fawn
was
to
be
the
lucky
man
,
"
said
Frank
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
you
did
.
<EOS>
I
had
n't
seen
it
.
<EOS>
I
can
only
say
I
wish
it
had
been
the
other
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
so
?
<EOS>
Fawn
is
n't
a
bad
fellow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
 
not
exactly
a
bad
fellow
.
<EOS>
He
is
n't
,
you
know
,
what
I
call
a
good
fellow
.
<EOS>
In
the
first
place
,
he
is
marrying
her
altogether
for
her
money
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Which
is
just
what
you
advised
me
to
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
thought
you
really
liked
her
.
<EOS>
And
then
Fawn
will
be
always
afraid
of
her
,
 
and
wo
n't
be
in
the
least
afraid
of
us
.
<EOS>
We
shall
have
to
fight
him
,
and
he
wo
n't
fight
her
.
<EOS>
He
's
a
cantankerous
fellow
,
 
is
Fawn
,
 
when
he
's
not
afraid
of
his
adversary
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
why
should
there
be
any
fighting
?
"
  
<EOS>
Eustace
paused
a
minute
,
and
rubbed
his
face
and
considered
the
matter
before
he
answered
.
<EOS>
"
She
is
troublesome
,
you
know
,
"
he
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
;
Lizzie
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Yes
;
 
and
I
begin
to
be
afraid
she
'll
give
us
as
much
as
we
know
how
to
do
.
<EOS>
I
was
with
Camperdown
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
I
'm
blessed
if
she
has
n't
begun
to
cut
down
a
whole
side
of
a
forest
at
Portray
.
<EOS>
She
has
no
more
right
to
touch
the
timber
,
except
for
repairs
about
the
place
,
than
you
have
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
if
she
lives
for
fifty
years
,
"
asked
Greystock
,
"
is
none
to
be
cut
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Yes
;
 
by
consent
.
<EOS>
Of
course
the
regular
cutting
for
the
year
is
done
,
year
by
year
.
<EOS>
That
's
as
regular
as
the
rents
,
and
the
produce
is
sold
by
the
acre
.
<EOS>
But
she
is
marking
the
old
oaks
.
<EOS>
What
the
deuce
can
she
want
money
for
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Fawn
will
put
all
that
right
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
'll
have
to
do
it
,
"
said
Eustace
.
<EOS>
"
Since
she
has
been
down
with
the
old
Lady
Fawn
,
she
has
written
a
note
to
Camperdown
,
 
after
leaving
all
his
letters
unanswered
for
the
last
twelvemonth
,
 
to
tell
him
that
Lord
Fawn
is
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
her
property
,
and
that
certain
people
,
called
Mowbray
and
Mopus
,
are
her
lawyers
.
<EOS>
Camperdown
is
in
an
awful
way
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Lord
Fawn
will
put
it
all
right
,
"
said
Frank
.
  
<EOS>
"
Camperdown
is
afraid
that
he
wo
n't
.
<EOS>
They
've
met
twice
since
the
engagement
was
made
,
and
Camperdown
says
that
,
at
the
last
meeting
,
Fawn
gave
himself
airs
,
or
was
,
at
any
rate
,
unpleasant
.
<EOS>
There
were
words
about
those
diamonds
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
mean
to
say
that
Lord
Fawn
wants
to
keep
your
brother
's
family
jewels
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Camperdown
did
n't
say
that
exactly
;
 
but
Fawn
made
no
offer
of
giving
them
up
.
<EOS>
I
was
n't
there
,
and
only
heard
what
Camperdown
told
me
.
<EOS>
Camperdown
thinks
he
's
afraid
of
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
n't
wonder
at
that
in
the
least
,
"
said
Frank
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
there
'll
be
trouble
,
"
continued
Eustace
,
"
and
Fawn
wo
n't
be
able
to
help
us
through
it
.
<EOS>
She
's
a
strong
-
willed
,
cunning
,
obstinate
,
clever
little
creature
.
<EOS>
Camperdown
swears
he
'll
be
too
many
for
her
,
but
I
almost
doubt
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
therefore
you
wish
I
were
going
to
marry
her
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
do
.
<EOS>
You
might
manage
her
.
<EOS>
The
money
comes
from
the
Eustace
property
,
and
I
'd
sooner
it
should
go
to
you
than
a
half
-
hearted
,
numb
-
fingered
,
cold
-
blooded
Whig
,
like
Fawn
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
like
cunning
women
,
"
said
Frank
.
  
<EOS>
"
As
bargains
go
,
it
would
n't
be
a
bad
one
,
"
said
Eustace
.
<EOS>
"
She
's
very
young
,
has
a
noble
jointure
,
and
is
as
handsome
as
she
can
stand
.
<EOS>
It
's
too
good
a
thing
for
Fawn
;
 
too
good
for
any
Whig
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
When
Eustace
left
him
,
Greystock
lit
his
cigar
and
walked
with
it
in
his
mouth
from
Pall
Mall
to
the
Temple
.
<EOS>
He
often
worked
there
at
night
when
he
was
not
bound
to
be
in
the
House
,
or
when
the
House
was
not
sitting
,
 
and
he
was
now
intent
on
mastering
the
mysteries
of
some
much
-
complicated
legal
case
which
had
been
confided
to
him
,
in
order
that
he
might
present
it
to
a
jury
enveloped
in
increased
mystery
.
<EOS>
But
,
as
he
went
,
he
thought
rather
of
matrimony
than
of
law
;
 
and
he
thought
especially
of
matrimony
as
it
was
about
to
affect
Lord
Fawn
.
<EOS>
Could
a
man
be
justified
in
marrying
for
money
,
or
have
rational
ground
for
expecting
that
he
might
make
himself
happy
by
doing
so
?
<EOS>
He
kept
muttering
to
himself
as
he
went
,
the
Quaker
's
advice
to
the
old
farmer
,
"
Doan't
thou
marry
for
munny
,
but
goa
where
munny
is
!
"
<EOS>
But
he
muttered
it
as
condemning
the
advice
rather
than
accepting
it
.
  
<EOS>
He
could
look
out
and
see
two
altogether
different
kinds
of
life
before
him
,
both
of
which
had
their
allurements
.
<EOS>
There
was
the
Belgravia
-
cum
-
Pimlico
life
,
the
scene
of
which
might
extend
itself
to
South
Kensington
,
enveloping
the
parks
and
coming
round
over
Park
Lane
,
and
through
Grosvenor
Square
and
Berkeley
Square
back
to
Piccadilly
.
<EOS>
Within
this
he
might
live
with
lords
and
countesses
and
rich
folk
generally
,
going
out
to
the
very
best
dinner
-
parties
,
avoiding
stupid
people
,
having
everything
the
world
could
give
,
except
a
wife
and
family
and
home
of
his
own
.
<EOS>
All
this
he
could
achieve
by
the
work
which
would
certainly
fall
in
his
way
,
and
by
means
of
that
position
in
the
world
which
he
had
already
attained
by
his
wits
.
<EOS>
And
the
wife
,
with
the
family
and
house
of
his
own
,
might
be
forthcoming
,
should
it
ever
come
in
his
way
to
form
an
attachment
with
a
wealthy
woman
.
<EOS>
He
knew
how
dangerous
were
the
charms
of
such
a
life
as
this
to
a
man
growing
old
among
the
flesh
-
pots
,
without
any
one
to
depend
upon
him
.
<EOS>
He
had
seen
what
becomes
of
the
man
who
is
always
dining
out
at
sixty
.
<EOS>
But
he
might
avoid
that
.
"
<EOS>
Doan't
thou
marry
for
munny
,
but
goa
where
munny
is
.
"
<EOS>
And
then
there
was
that
other
outlook
<EOS>
,
the
scene
of
which
was
laid
somewhere
north
of
Oxford
Street
,
and
the
glory
of
which
consisted
in
Lucy
's
smile
,
and
Lucy
's
hand
,
and
Lucy
's
kiss
,
as
he
returned
home
weary
from
his
work
.
  
<EOS>
There
are
many
men
,
and
some
women
,
who
pass
their
lives
without
knowing
what
it
is
to
be
or
to
have
been
in
love
.
<EOS>
They
not
improbably
marry
,
 
the
men
do
,
at
least
,
 
and
make
good
average
husbands
.
<EOS>
Their
wives
are
useful
to
them
,
and
they
learn
to
feel
that
a
woman
,
being
a
wife
,
is
entitled
to
all
the
respect
,
protection
,
and
honour
which
a
man
can
give
,
or
procure
for
her
.
<EOS>
Such
men
,
no
doubt
,
often
live
honest
lives
,
are
good
Christians
,
and
depart
hence
with
hopes
as
justifiable
as
though
they
had
loved
as
well
as
Romeo
.
<EOS>
But
yet
,
as
men
,
they
have
lacked
a
something
,
the
want
of
which
has
made
them
small
and
poor
and
dry
.
<EOS>
It
has
never
been
felt
by
such
a
one
that
there
would
be
triumph
in
giving
away
everything
belonging
to
him
for
one
little
whispered
,
yielding
word
,
in
which
there
should
be
acknowledgment
that
he
had
succeeded
in
making
himself
master
of
a
human
heart
.
<EOS>
And
there
are
other
men
,
 
very
many
men
,
 
who
have
felt
this
love
,
and
have
resisted
it
,
feeling
it
to
be
unfit
that
Love
should
be
Lord
of
all
.
<EOS>
Frank
Greystock
had
told
himself
,
a
score
of
times
,
that
it
would
be
unbecoming
in
him
to
allow
a
passion
to
obtain
such
mastery
of
him
as
to
interfere
with
his
ambition
.
<EOS>
Could
it
be
right
that
he
who
,
as
a
young
man
,
had
already
done
so
much
,
who
might
possibly
have
before
him
so
high
and
great
a
career
,
should
miss
that
,
because
he
could
not
resist
a
feeling
which
a
little
chit
of
a
girl
had
created
in
his
bosom
,
 
a
girl
without
money
,
without
position
,
without
even
beauty
;
a
girl
as
to
whom
,
were
he
to
marry
her
,
the
world
would
say
,
"
Oh
,
heaven
!
 
<EOS>
there
has
<EOS>
Frank
Greystock
gone
and
married
a
little
governess
out
of
old
Lady
Fawn
's
nursery
!
"
<EOS>
And
yet
he
loved
her
with
all
his
heart
,
and
to
-
day
he
had
told
her
of
his
love
.
<EOS>
What
should
he
do
next
?
  
<EOS>
The
complicated
legal
case
received
neither
much
ravelling
nor
unravelling
from
his
brains
that
night
;
but
before
he
left
his
chambers
he
wrote
the
following
letter
:
    
Midnight
,
Saturday
,
All
among
my
books
and
papers
,
2
,
Bolt
Court
,
Middle
Temple
.
  
<EOS>
DEAR
,
DEAR
LUCY
,
  
I
told
you
to
-
day
that
you
had
ever
been
the
Queen
who
reigned
in
those
palaces
which
I
have
built
in
Spain
.
<EOS>
You
did
not
make
me
much
of
an
answer
;
but
such
as
it
was
,
 
only
just
one
muttered
doubtful
-
sounding
word
,
 
it
has
made
me
hope
that
I
may
be
justified
in
asking
you
to
share
with
me
a
home
which
will
not
be
palatial
.
<EOS>
If
I
am
wrong
 
?
<EOS>
But
no
;
 
<EOS>
I
will
not
think
I
am
wrong
,
or
that
I
can
be
wrong
.
<EOS>
No
sound
coming
from
you
is
really
doubtful
.
<EOS>
You
are
truth
itself
,
and
the
muttered
word
would
have
been
other
than
it
was
,
if
you
had
not
 
!
<EOS>
may
I
say
,
 
had
you
not
already
learned
to
love
me
?
  
<EOS>
You
will
feel
,
perhaps
,
that
I
ought
to
have
said
all
this
to
you
then
,
and
that
a
letter
in
such
a
matter
is
but
a
poor
substitute
for
a
spoken
assurance
of
affection
.
<EOS>
You
shall
have
the
whole
truth
.
<EOS>
Though
I
have
long
loved
you
,
I
did
not
go
down
to
Fawn
Court
with
the
purpose
of
declaring
to
you
my
love
.
<EOS>
What
I
said
to
you
was
God
's
truth
;
but
it
was
spoken
without
thought
at
the
moment
.
<EOS>
I
have
thought
of
it
much
since
;
 
and
now
I
write
to
ask
you
to
be
my
wife
.
<EOS>
I
have
lived
for
the
last
year
or
two
with
this
hope
before
me
;
and
now
 
Dear
,
dear
Lucy
,
I
will
not
write
in
too
great
confidence
;
but
I
will
tell
you
that
all
my
happiness
is
in
your
hands
.
  
<EOS>
If
your
answer
is
what
I
hope
it
may
be
,
tell
Lady
Fawn
at
once
.
<EOS>
I
shall
immediately
write
to
Bobsborough
,
as
I
hate
secrets
in
such
matters
.
<EOS>
And
if
it
is
to
be
so
,
 
then
I
shall
claim
the
privilege
of
going
to
Fawn
Court
as
soon
and
as
often
as
I
please
.
  
<EOS>
Yours
ever
and
always
,
 
if
you
will
have
me
,
    
F.
G.
  
He
sat
for
an
hour
at
his
desk
,
with
his
letter
lying
on
the
table
,
before
he
left
his
chambers
,
 
looking
at
it
.
<EOS>
If
he
should
decide
on
posting
it
,
then
would
that
life
in
Belgravia
-
cum
-
Pimlico
,
 
of
which
in
truth
he
was
very
fond
,
 
be
almost
closed
for
him
.
<EOS>
The
lords
and
countesses
,
and
rich
county
members
,
and
leading
politicians
,
who
were
delighted
to
welcome
him
,
would
not
care
for
his
wife
;
nor
could
he
very
well
take
his
wife
among
them
.
<EOS>
To
live
with
them
as
a
married
man
,
he
must
live
as
they
lived
;
 
and
must
have
his
own
house
in
their
precincts
.
<EOS>
Later
in
life
,
he
might
possibly
work
up
to
this
;
 
but
for
the
present
he
must
retire
into
dim
domestic
security
and
the
neighbourhood
of
Regent
's
Park
.
<EOS>
He
sat
looking
at
the
letter
,
telling
himself
that
he
was
now
,
at
this
moment
,
deciding
his
own
fate
in
life
.
<EOS>
And
he
again
muttered
the
Quaker
's
advice
,
"
Doan't
thou
marry
for
munny
,
but
goa
where
munny
is
!
<EOS>
"
It
may
be
said
,
however
,
that
no
man
ever
writes
such
a
letter
,
and
then
omits
to
send
it
.
<EOS>
He
walked
out
of
the
Temple
with
it
in
his
hand
,
and
dropped
it
into
a
pillar
letter
-
box
just
outside
the
gate
.
<EOS>
As
the
envelope
slipped
through
his
fingers
,
he
felt
that
he
had
now
bound
himself
to
his
fate
.
   
<EOS>
"
Doan't
Thou
Marry
for
Munny
"
 
<EOS>
As
that
Saturday
afternoon
wore
itself
away
,
there
was
much
excitement
at
Fawn
Court
.
<EOS>
When
Lady
Fawn
returned
with
the
carriage
,
she
heard
that
Frank
Greystock
had
been
at
Fawn
Court
;
and
she
heard
also
,
from
Augusta
,
that
he
had
been
rambling
about
the
grounds
alone
with
Lucy
Morris
.
<EOS>
At
any
exhibition
of
old
ladies
,
held
before
a
competent
jury
,
Lady
Fawn
would
have
taken
a
prize
on
the
score
of
good
humour
.
<EOS>
No
mother
of
daughters
was
ever
less
addicted
to
scold
and
to
be
fretful
.
<EOS>
But
just
now
she
was
a
little
unhappy
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
's
visit
had
not
been
a
success
,
and
she
looked
forward
to
her
son
's
marriage
with
almost
unmixed
dismay
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Hittaway
had
written
daily
,
and
in
all
Mrs.
Hittaway
's
letters
some
addition
was
made
to
the
evil
things
already
known
.
<EOS>
In
her
last
letter
Mrs.
Hittaway
had
expressed
her
opinion
that
even
yet
"
Frederic
"
would
escape
.
<EOS>
All
this
Lady
Fawn
had
,
of
course
,
not
told
to
her
daughters
generally
.
<EOS>
To
the
eldest
,
Augusta
,
it
was
thought
expedient
to
say
nothing
,
because
Augusta
had
been
selected
as
the
companion
of
the
,
alas
!
<EOS>
too
probable
future
Lady
Fawn
.
<EOS>
But
to
Amelia
something
did
leak
out
,
and
it
became
apparent
that
the
household
was
uneasy
.
<EOS>
Now
,
 
as
an
evil
added
to
this
,
 
Frank
Greystock
had
been
there
in
Lady
Fawn
's
absence
,
walking
about
the
grounds
alone
with
Lucy
Morris
.
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
could
hardly
restrain
herself
.
<EOS>
"
How
could
Lucy
be
so
very
wrong
?
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
in
the
hearing
both
of
Augusta
and
Amelia
.
  
<EOS>
Lizzie
Eustace
did
not
hear
this
;
but
knowing
very
well
that
a
governess
should
not
receive
a
lover
in
the
absence
of
the
lady
of
the
house
,
she
made
her
little
speech
about
it
.
"
<EOS>
Dear
Lady
Fawn
,
"
she
said
,
"
my
cousin
Frank
came
to
see
me
while
you
were
out
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
So
I
hear
,
"
said
Lady
Fawn
.
  
<EOS>
"
Frank
and
I
are
more
like
brother
and
sister
than
anything
else
.
<EOS>
I
had
so
much
to
say
to
him
;
 
so
much
to
ask
him
to
do
!
<EOS>
I
have
no
one
else
,
you
know
,
and
I
had
especially
told
him
to
come
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
he
was
welcome
to
come
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Only
I
was
afraid
you
might
think
that
there
was
some
little
lover
's
trick
,
 
on
dear
Lucy
's
part
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
suspect
anything
of
that
kind
,
"
said
Lady
Fawn
,
bridling
up
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Lucy
Morris
is
above
any
sort
of
trick
.
<EOS>
We
do
n't
have
any
tricks
here
,
Lady
Eustace
.
"
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
herself
might
say
that
Lucy
was
"
wrong
,
"
but
no
one
else
in
that
house
should
even
suggest
evil
of
Lucy
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
retreated
smiling
.
<EOS>
To
have
"
put
Lady
Fawn
's
back
up
,
"
as
she
called
it
,
was
to
her
an
achievement
and
a
pleasure
.
  
<EOS>
But
the
great
excitement
of
the
evening
consisted
in
the
expected
coming
of
Lord
Fawn
.
<EOS>
Of
what
nature
would
be
the
meeting
between
Lord
Fawn
and
his
promised
bride
?
<EOS>
Was
there
anything
of
truth
in
the
opinion
expressed
by
Mrs.
Hittaway
that
her
brother
was
beginning
to
become
tired
of
his
bargain
?
<EOS>
That
Lady
Fawn
was
tired
of
it
herself
,
 
that
she
disliked
Lizzie
,
and
was
afraid
of
her
,
and
averse
to
the
idea
of
regarding
her
as
a
daughter
-
in
-
law
,
 
she
did
not
now
attempt
to
hide
from
herself
.
<EOS>
But
there
was
the
engagement
,
known
to
all
the
world
,
and
how
could
its
fulfilment
now
be
avoided
?
<EOS>
The
poor
dear
old
woman
began
to
repeat
to
herself
the
first
half
of
the
Quaker
's
advice
,
"
Doan't
thou
marry
for
munny
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
was
to
come
down
only
in
time
for
a
late
dinner
.
<EOS>
An
ardent
lover
,
one
would
have
thought
,
might
have
left
his
work
somewhat
earlier
on
a
Saturday
,
so
as
to
have
enjoyed
with
his
sweetheart
something
of
the
sweetness
of
the
Saturday
summer
afternoon
;
 
but
it
was
seven
before
he
reached
Fawn
Court
,
and
the
ladies
were
at
that
time
in
their
rooms
dressing
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
had
affected
to
understand
all
his
reasons
for
being
so
late
,
and
had
expressed
herself
as
perfectly
satisfied
.
"
<EOS>
He
has
more
to
do
than
any
of
the
others
,
"
she
had
said
to
Augusta
.
"
<EOS>
Indeed
,
the
whole
of
our
vast
Indian
empire
may
be
said
to
hang
upon
him
,
just
at
present
;
"
 
which
was
not
complimentary
to
Lord
Fawn
's
chief
,
the
Right
Honourable
Legge
Wilson
,
who
at
the
present
time
represented
the
interests
of
India
in
the
Cabinet
.
"
<EOS>
He
is
terribly
overworked
,
and
it
is
a
shame
;
 
but
what
can
one
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
he
likes
work
,
"
Augusta
had
replied
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
do
n't
like
it
,
 
not
so
much
of
it
;
and
so
I
shall
make
him
understand
,
<EOS>
my
dear
.
<EOS>
But
I
do
n't
complain
.
<EOS>
As
long
as
he
tells
me
everything
,
I
will
never
really
complain
.
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
it
might
some
day
be
as
she
desired
;
perhaps
as
a
husband
he
would
be
thoroughly
confidential
and
communicative
;
perhaps
when
they
two
were
one
flesh
he
would
tell
her
everything
about
India
;
 
but
as
yet
he
certainly
had
not
told
her
much
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
had
they
better
meet
?
<EOS>
"
Amelia
asked
her
mother
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
;
 
I
do
n't
know
;
 
anyhow
;
just
as
they
like
.
<EOS>
We
ca
n't
arrange
anything
for
her
.
<EOS>
If
she
had
chosen
to
dress
herself
early
,
she
might
have
seen
him
as
he
came
in
;
but
it
was
impossible
to
tell
her
so
.
<EOS>
"
No
arrangement
was
therefore
made
,
and
as
all
the
other
ladies
were
in
the
drawing
-
room
before
Lizzie
came
down
,
she
had
to
give
him
his
welcome
in
the
midst
of
the
family
circle
.
<EOS>
She
did
it
very
well
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
she
had
thought
of
it
,
and
made
her
arrangements
.
<EOS>
When
he
came
forward
to
greet
her
,
she
put
her
cheek
up
,
just
a
little
,
so
that
he
might
see
that
he
was
expected
to
kiss
it
;
 
<EOS>
but
so
little
,
that
should
he
omit
to
do
so
,
there
might
be
no
visible
awkwardness
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
acknowledged
on
Lizzie
's
behalf
,
that
she
could
always
avoid
awkwardness
.
<EOS>
He
did
touch
her
cheek
with
his
lips
,
blushing
as
he
did
so
.
<EOS>
She
had
her
ungloved
hand
in
his
,
and
,
still
holding
him
,
returned
into
the
circle
.
<EOS>
She
said
not
a
word
;
and
what
he
said
was
of
no
moment
;
 
but
they
had
met
as
lovers
,
and
any
of
the
family
who
had
allowed
themselves
to
imagine
that
even
yet
the
match
might
be
broken
,
now
unconsciously
abandoned
that
hope
.
<EOS>
"
Was
he
always
such
a
truant
,
Lady
Fawn
?
"
 
<EOS>
Lizzie
asked
,
when
it
seemed
to
her
that
no
one
else
would
speak
a
word
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
that
there
is
much
difference
,
"
said
Lady
Fawn
.
<EOS>
"
Here
is
dinner
.
<EOS>
Frederic
,
will
you
give
 
Lady
Eustace
your
arm
?
"
<EOS>
Poor
Lady
Fawn
!
<EOS>
It
often
came
to
pass
that
she
was
awkward
.
  
<EOS>
There
were
no
less
than
ten
females
sitting
round
the
board
,
at
the
bottom
of
which
Lord
Fawn
took
his
place
.
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
had
especially
asked
Lucy
to
come
in
to
dinner
,
and
with
Lucy
had
come
the
two
younger
girls
.
<EOS>
At
Lord
Fawn
's
right
hand
sat
Lizzie
,
and
Augusta
at
his
left
.
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
had
Amelia
on
one
side
and
Lucy
on
the
other
.
"
<EOS>
So
Mr.
Greystock
was
here
to
-
day
,
"
Lady
Fawn
whispered
into
Lucy
's
ear
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
he
was
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Lucy
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
not
bid
him
come
,
Lady
Fawn
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
of
that
,
my
dear
;
 
but
 
<EOS>
but
 
"
Then
there
was
no
more
to
be
said
on
that
subject
on
that
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
During
the
whole
of
the
dinner
the
conversation
was
kept
up
at
the
other
end
of
the
table
by
Lizzie
talking
to
Augusta
across
her
lover
.
<EOS>
This
was
done
in
such
a
manner
as
to
seem
to
include
Lord
Fawn
in
every
topic
discussed
.
<EOS>
Parliament
,
India
,
the
Sawab
,
Ireland
,
the
special
privileges
of
the
House
of
Lords
,
the
ease
of
a
bachelor
life
,
and
the
delight
of
having
at
his
elbow
just
such
a
rural
retreat
as
Fawn
Court
,
 
<EOS>
these
were
the
fruitful
themes
of
Lizzie
's
eloquence
.
<EOS>
Augusta
did
her
part
at
any
rate
with
patience
;
and
as
for
Lizzie
herself
,
she
worked
with
that
superhuman
energy
which
women
can
so
often
display
in
making
conversation
under
unfavourable
circumstances
.
<EOS>
The
circumstances
were
unfavourable
,
for
Lord
Fawn
himself
would
hardly
open
his
mouth
;
but
Lizzie
persevered
,
and
the
hour
of
dinner
passed
over
without
any
show
of
ill
-
humour
,
or
of
sullen
silence
.
<EOS>
When
the
hour
was
over
,
Lord
Fawn
left
the
room
with
the
ladies
,
and
was
soon
closeted
with
his
mother
,
while
the
girls
strolled
out
upon
the
lawn
.
<EOS>
Would
Lizzie
play
croquet
?
<EOS>
No
;
Lizzie
would
not
play
croquet
.
<EOS>
She
thought
it
probable
that
she
might
catch
her
lover
and
force
him
to
walk
with
her
through
the
shrubberies
;
but
Lord
Fawn
was
not
seen
upon
the
lawn
that
evening
,
and
Lizzie
was
forced
to
content
herself
with
Augusta
as
a
companion
.
<EOS>
In
the
course
of
the
evening
,
however
,
her
lover
did
say
a
word
to
her
in
private
.
"
<EOS>
Give
me
ten
minutes
to
-
morrow
between
breakfast
and
church
,
Lizzie
.
"
<EOS>
Lizzie
promised
that
she
would
do
so
,
smiling
sweetly
.
<EOS>
Then
there
was
a
little
music
,
and
then
Lord
Fawn
retired
to
his
studies
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
he
going
to
say
to
me
?
"
<EOS>
Lizzie
asked
Augusta
the
next
morning
.
<EOS>
There
existed
in
her
bosom
a
sort
of
craving
after
confidential
friendship
,
 
but
with
it
there
existed
something
that
was
altogether
incompatible
with
confidence
.
<EOS>
She
thoroughly
despised
Augusta
Fawn
,
and
yet
would
have
been
willing
,
 
in
want
of
a
better
friend
,
 
to
press
Augusta
to
her
bosom
,
and
swear
that
there
should
ever
be
between
them
the
tenderest
friendship
.
<EOS>
She
desired
to
be
the
possessor
of
the
outward
shows
of
all
those
things
of
which
the
inward
facts
are
valued
by
the
good
and
steadfast
ones
of
the
earth
.
<EOS>
She
knew
what
were
the
aspirations
,
 
what
the
ambition
,
of
an
honest
woman
;
and
she
knew
,
too
,
how
rich
were
the
probable
rewards
of
such
honesty
.
<EOS>
True
love
,
true
friendship
,
true
benevolence
,
true
tenderness
,
were
beautiful
to
her
,
 
qualities
on
which
she
could
descant
almost
with
eloquence
;
and
therefore
she
was
always
shamming
love
and
friendship
and
benevolence
and
tenderness
.
<EOS>
She
could
tell
you
,
with
words
most
appropriate
to
the
subject
,
how
horrible
were
all
shams
,
and
in
saying
so
would
be
not
altogether
insincere
;
 
yet
she
knew
that
she
herself
was
ever
shamming
,
and
she
satisfied
herself
with
shams
.
<EOS>
"
What
is
he
going
to
say
to
me
?
"
<EOS>
she
asked
Augusta
,
with
her
hands
clasped
,
when
she
went
up
to
put
her
bonnet
on
after
breakfast
.
  
<EOS>
"
To
fix
the
day
,
I
suppose
,
"
said
Augusta
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
thought
so
,
I
would
endeavour
to
please
him
.
<EOS>
But
it
is
n't
that
.
<EOS>
I
know
his
manner
so
well
!
<EOS>
I
am
sure
it
is
not
that
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
it
is
something
about
my
boy
.
<EOS>
He
will
not
wish
to
separate
a
mother
from
her
child
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
dear
,
no
,
"
said
Augusta
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
Frederic
will
not
want
to
do
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
In
anything
else
I
will
obey
him
,
"
said
Lizzie
,
again
clasping
her
hands
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
must
not
keep
him
waiting
,
 
must
I
?
<EOS>
I
fear
my
future
lord
is
somewhat
impatient
.
<EOS>
"
Now
,
if
among
Lord
Fawn
's
merits
one
merit
was
more
conspicuous
than
another
,
it
was
that
of
patience
.
<EOS>
When
Lizzie
descended
he
was
waiting
for
her
in
the
hall
without
a
thought
that
he
was
being
kept
too
long
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Now
,
Frederic
!
<EOS>
I
should
have
been
with
you
two
whole
minutes
since
,
if
I
had
not
had
just
a
word
to
say
to
Augusta
.
<EOS>
I
do
<EOS>
so
love
Augusta
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
is
a
very
good
girl
,
"
said
Lord
Fawn
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
true
and
genuine
,
 
and
so
full
of
spirit
.
<EOS>
I
will
come
on
the
other
side
because
of
my
parasol
and
the
sun
.
<EOS>
There
,
that
will
do
.
<EOS>
We
have
an
hour
nearly
before
going
to
church
;
 
have
n't
we
?
<EOS>
I
suppose
you
will
go
to
church
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
intend
it
,
"
said
Lord
Fawn
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
so
nice
to
go
to
church
,
"
said
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
Since
her
widowhood
had
commenced
,
she
had
compromised
matters
with
the
world
.
<EOS>
One
Sunday
she
would
go
to
church
,
and
the
next
she
would
have
a
headache
and
a
French
novel
and
stay
in
bed
.
<EOS>
But
she
was
prepared
for
stricter
conduct
during
at
least
the
first
months
of
her
newly
-
married
life
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Lizzie
,
"
began
Lord
Fawn
,
"
since
I
last
saw
you
I
have
been
twice
with
Mr.
Camperdown
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
not
going
to
talk
about
Mr.
Camperdown
to
-
day
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Well
;
 
yes
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
do
so
last
night
,
and
I
shall
be
back
in
London
either
to
-
night
or
before
you
are
up
to
-
morrow
morning
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hate
the
very
name
of
Mr.
Camperdown
,
"
said
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
for
that
,
because
I
am
sure
you
could
not
find
an
honester
lawyer
to
manage
your
affairs
for
you
.
<EOS>
He
does
everything
for
me
,
and
so
he
did
for
Sir
Florian
Eustace
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
just
the
reason
why
I
employ
some
one
else
,
"
she
answered
.
  
<EOS>
"
Very
well
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
going
to
say
a
word
about
that
.
<EOS>
I
may
regret
it
,
but
I
am
,
just
at
present
,
the
last
person
in
the
world
to
urge
you
upon
that
subject
.
<EOS>
What
I
want
to
say
is
this
.
<EOS>
You
must
restore
those
diamonds
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
To
whom
shall
I
restore
them
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
To
Mr.
Garnett
,
the
silversmith
,
if
you
please
,
 
or
to
Mr.
Camperdown
;
 
or
,
if
you
like
it
better
,
to
your
brother
-
in
-
law
,
Mr.
John
Eustace
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
why
am
I
to
give
up
my
own
property
?
"
  
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
paused
for
some
seconds
before
he
replied
.
"
<EOS>
To
satisfy
my
honour
,
"
he
then
said
.
<EOS>
As
she
made
him
no
immediate
answer
,
he
continued
,
 
<EOS>
"
It
would
not
suit
my
views
that
my
wife
should
be
seen
wearing
the
jewels
of
the
Eustace
family
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
want
to
wear
them
,
"
said
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
why
should
you
desire
to
keep
them
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Because
they
are
my
own
.
<EOS>
Because
I
do
not
choose
to
be
put
upon
.
<EOS>
Because
I
will
not
allow
such
a
cunning
old
snake
as
Mr.
Camperdown
to
rob
me
of
my
property
.
<EOS>
They
are
my
own
,
and
you
should
defend
my
right
to
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
will
not
oblige
me
by
doing
what
I
ask
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
be
robbed
of
what
is
my
own
,
"
said
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
I
must
declare
 
"
and
now
Lord
Fawn
spoke
very
slowly
 
"
then
I
must
declare
that
under
these
circumstances
,
let
the
consequences
be
what
they
may
,
I
must
retreat
from
the
enviable
position
which
your
favour
has
given
me
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
words
were
cold
and
solemn
,
and
were
ill
-
spoken
;
but
they
were
deliberate
,
and
had
been
indeed
actually
learned
by
heart
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
?
"
said
Lizzie
,
flashing
round
upon
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
mean
what
I
say
,
 
exactly
.
<EOS>
But
perhaps
it
may
be
well
that
I
should
explain
my
motives
more
clearly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
anything
about
motives
,
and
I
do
n't
care
anything
about
motives
.
<EOS>
Do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
you
have
come
here
to
threaten
me
with
deserting
me
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
had
better
hear
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
choose
to
hear
a
word
more
after
what
you
have
said
,
 
unless
it
be
in
the
way
of
an
apology
,
or
retracting
your
most
injurious
accusation
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
said
nothing
to
retract
,
"
said
Lord
Fawn
solemnly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
I
will
not
hear
another
word
from
you
.
<EOS>
I
have
friends
,
and
you
shall
see
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
,
who
had
thought
a
great
deal
upon
the
subject
,
and
had
well
understood
that
this
interview
would
be
for
him
one
of
great
difficulty
,
was
very
anxious
to
induce
her
to
listen
to
a
few
further
words
of
explanation
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Dear
Lizzie
 
<EOS>
"
he
began
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
be
addressed
,
sir
,
in
that
way
by
a
man
who
is
treating
me
as
you
are
doing
,
"
she
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
want
you
to
understand
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Understand
you
!
<EOS>
You
understand
nothing
yourself
that
a
man
ought
to
understand
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
that
you
have
the
courage
to
be
so
insolent
.
<EOS>
If
you
knew
what
you
were
doing
,
you
would
not
have
the
spirit
to
do
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Her
words
did
not
quite
come
home
to
him
,
and
much
of
her
scorn
was
lost
upon
him
.
<EOS>
He
was
now
chiefly
anxious
to
explain
to
her
that
though
he
must
abide
by
the
threat
he
had
made
,
he
was
quite
willing
to
go
on
with
his
engagement
if
she
would
oblige
him
in
the
matter
of
the
diamonds
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
necessary
that
I
should
explain
to
you
that
I
could
not
allow
that
necklace
to
be
brought
into
my
house
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
one
thought
of
taking
it
to
your
house
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
were
you
to
do
with
it
,
then
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Keep
it
in
my
own
,
"
said
Lizzie
stoutly
.
<EOS>
They
were
still
walking
together
,
and
were
now
altogether
out
of
sight
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
in
her
excitement
had
forgotten
church
,
had
forgotten
the
Fawn
women
,
 
had
forgotten
everything
except
the
battle
which
it
was
necessary
that
she
should
fight
for
herself
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
mean
to
allow
the
marriage
to
be
broken
off
,
 
but
she
meant
to
retain
the
necklace
.
<EOS>
The
manner
in
which
Lord
Fawn
had
demanded
its
restitution
,
 
in
which
there
had
been
none
of
that
mock
tenderness
by
which
she
might
have
permitted
herself
to
be
persuaded
,
 
had
made
her
,
at
any
rate
for
the
moment
,
as
firm
as
steel
on
this
point
.
<EOS>
It
was
inconceivable
to
her
that
he
should
think
himself
at
liberty
to
go
back
from
his
promise
,
because
she
would
not
render
up
property
which
was
in
her
possession
,
and
which
no
one
could
prove
not
to
be
legally
her
own
!
<EOS>
She
walked
on
full
of
fierce
courage
,
 
despising
him
,
but
determined
that
she
would
marry
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
afraid
we
do
not
understand
each
other
,
"
he
said
at
last
.
  
<EOS>
"
Certainly
I
do
not
understand
you
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
allow
my
mother
to
speak
to
you
on
the
subject
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
.
<EOS>
If
I
told
your
mother
to
give
up
her
diamonds
,
what
would
she
say
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
they
are
not
yours
,
Lady
Eustace
,
unless
you
will
submit
that
question
to
an
arbitrator
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
submit
nothing
to
anybody
.
<EOS>
You
have
no
right
to
speak
on
such
a
subject
till
after
we
are
married
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
have
it
settled
first
,
Lady
Eustace
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
,
Lord
Fawn
,
you
wo
n't
have
it
settled
first
.
<EOS>
Or
rather
it
is
settled
already
.
<EOS>
I
shall
keep
my
own
necklace
,
and
Mr.
Camperdown
may
do
anything
he
pleases
.
<EOS>
As
for
you
,
 
if
you
ill
-
treat
me
,
I
shall
know
where
to
go
to
.
<EOS>
"
They
had
now
come
out
from
the
shrubbery
upon
the
lawn
,
and
there
was
the
carriage
at
the
door
,
ready
to
take
the
elders
of
the
family
to
church
.
<EOS>
Of
course
in
such
a
condition
of
affairs
it
would
be
understood
that
Lizzie
was
one
of
the
elders
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
not
go
to
church
now
,
"
she
said
,
as
she
advanced
across
the
lawn
towards
the
hall
door
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
be
pleased
,
Lord
Fawn
,
to
let
your
mother
know
that
I
am
detained
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
suppose
that
you
will
dare
to
tell
her
why
.
<EOS>
"
Then
she
sailed
round
at
the
back
of
the
carriage
and
entered
the
hall
,
in
which
several
of
the
girls
were
standing
.
<EOS>
Among
them
was
Augusta
,
waiting
to
take
her
seat
among
the
elders
;
 
but
Lizzie
passed
on
through
them
all
,
without
a
word
,
and
marched
up
to
her
bed
-
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Frederic
,
what
is
the
matter
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Augusta
,
as
soon
as
her
brother
entered
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
"
Never
mind
.
<EOS>
Nothing
is
the
matter
.
<EOS>
You
had
better
go
to
church
.
<EOS>
Where
is
my
mother
?
"
  
<EOS>
At
this
moment
Lady
Fawn
appeared
at
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
,
having
passed
Lizzie
as
she
was
coming
down
.
<EOS>
Not
a
syllable
had
then
been
spoken
,
but
Lady
Fawn
at
once
knew
that
much
was
wrong
.
<EOS>
Her
son
went
up
to
her
and
whispered
a
word
in
her
ear
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
certainly
,
"
she
said
,
desisting
from
the
operation
of
pulling
on
her
gloves
.
<EOS>
"
Augusta
,
neither
your
brother
nor
I
will
go
to
church
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Nor
 
Lady
Eustace
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
seems
not
,
"
said
Lady
Fawn
.
  
<EOS>
"
Lady
Eustace
will
not
go
to
church
,
"
said
Lord
Fawn
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
where
is
Lucy
?
"
asked
Lydia
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
will
not
go
to
church
either
,
"
said
Lady
Fawn
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
just
been
with
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nobody
is
going
to
church
,
"
said
Nina
.
<EOS>
"
All
the
same
,
I
shall
go
by
myself
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Augusta
,
my
dear
,
you
and
the
girls
had
better
go
.
<EOS>
You
can
take
the
carriage
of
course
.
"
<EOS>
But
Augusta
and
the
girls
chose
to
walk
,
and
the
carriage
was
sent
round
into
the
yard
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
a
rumpus
already
between
my
lord
and
the
young
missus
,
"
said
the
coachman
to
the
groom
;
 
for
the
coachman
had
seen
the
way
in
which
Lady
Eustace
had
returned
to
the
house
.
<EOS>
And
there
certainly
was
a
rumpus
.
<EOS>
During
the
whole
morning
Lord
Fawn
was
closeted
with
his
mother
,
and
then
he
went
away
to
London
without
saying
a
word
to
any
one
of
the
family
.
<EOS>
But
he
left
this
note
for
Lady
Eustace
:
    
<EOS>
DEAREST
LIZZIE
,
  
Think
well
of
what
I
have
said
to
you
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
that
I
desire
to
break
off
our
engagement
;
but
that
I
can
not
allow
my
wife
to
keep
the
diamonds
which
belong
of
right
to
her
late
husband
's
family
.
<EOS>
You
may
be
sure
that
I
should
not
be
thus
urgent
<EOS>
had
I
not
taken
steps
to
ascertain
that
I
am
right
in
my
judgment
.
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
you
had
better
consult
my
mother
.
  
<EOS>
Yours
affectionately
,
  
FAWN
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
'll
Give
You
a
Hundred
Guinea
Brooch
"
 
<EOS>
There
had
been
another
"
affair
"
in
the
house
that
morning
,
though
of
a
nature
very
different
to
the
"
rumpus
"
which
had
occurred
between
Lord
Fawn
and
Lady
Eustace
.
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
had
been
closeted
with
Lucy
,
and
had
expressed
her
opinion
of
the
impropriety
of
Frank
Greystock
's
visit
.
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
he
came
to
see
his
cousin
,
"
said
Lady
Fawn
,
anxious
to
begin
with
some
apology
for
such
conduct
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
tell
,
"
said
Lucy
.
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
he
did
.
<EOS>
I
think
he
said
so
.
<EOS>
I
think
he
cared
more
to
see
me
.
"
<EOS>
Then
Lady
Fawn
was
obliged
to
express
her
opinion
,
and
she
did
so
,
uttering
many
words
of
wisdom
.
<EOS>
Frank
Greystock
,
had
he
intended
to
sacrifice
his
prospects
by
a
disinterested
marriage
,
would
have
spoken
out
before
now
.
<EOS>
He
was
old
enough
to
have
made
up
his
mind
on
such
a
subject
,
and
he
had
not
spoken
out
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
mean
marriage
.
<EOS>
That
was
quite
evident
to
Lady
Fawn
;
 
and
her
dear
Lucy
was
revelling
in
hopes
which
would
make
her
miserable
.
<EOS>
If
Lucy
could
only
have
known
of
the
letter
,
which
was
already
her
own
property
though
lying
in
the
pillar
letter
-
box
in
Fleet
Street
,
and
which
had
not
already
been
sent
down
and
delivered
simply
because
it
was
Sunday
morning
!
<EOS>
But
she
was
very
brave
.
"
<EOS>
He
does
love
me
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
He
told
me
so
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Lucy
;
 
<EOS>
that
is
worse
and
worse
.
<EOS>
A
man
to
tell
you
that
he
loves
you
,
and
yet
not
ask
you
to
be
his
wife
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
contented
,
"
said
Lucy
.
<EOS>
That
assertion
,
however
,
could
hardly
have
been
true
.
  
<EOS>
"
Contented
!
<EOS>
And
did
you
tell
him
that
you
returned
his
love
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
knew
it
without
my
telling
him
,
"
said
Lucy
.
<EOS>
It
was
so
hard
upon
her
that
she
should
be
so
interrogated
while
that
letter
was
lying
in
the
iron
box
!
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
Lucy
,
this
must
not
be
,
"
said
Lady
Fawn
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
preparing
for
yourself
inexpressible
misery
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
done
nothing
wrong
,
Lady
Fawn
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
my
dear
;
 
no
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
say
you
have
been
wrong
.
<EOS>
But
I
think
he
is
wrong
,
 
so
wrong
!
<EOS>
I
call
it
wicked
.
<EOS>
I
do
indeed
.
<EOS>
For
your
own
sake
you
should
endeavour
to
forget
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
never
forget
him
!
"
said
Lucy
.
<EOS>
"
To
think
of
him
is
everything
to
me
.
<EOS>
He
told
me
I
was
his
Queen
,
and
he
shall
be
my
King
.
<EOS>
I
will
be
loyal
to
him
always
.
"
<EOS>
To
poor
Lady
Fawn
this
was
very
dreadful
.
<EOS>
The
girl
persisted
in
declaring
her
love
for
the
man
,
and
yet
did
not
even
pretend
to
think
that
the
man
meant
to
marry
her
!
<EOS>
And
this
,
too
,
was
Lucy
Morris
,
 
of
whom
Lady
Fawn
was
accustomed
to
say
to
her
intimate
friends
that
she
had
altogether
ceased
to
look
upon
her
as
a
governess
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Just
one
of
ourselves
,
Mrs.
Winslow
,
 
and
almost
as
dear
as
one
of
my
own
girls
!
"
<EOS>
Thus
,
in
the
warmth
of
her
heart
,
she
had
described
Lucy
to
a
neighbour
within
the
last
week
.
<EOS>
Many
more
words
of
wisdom
she
spoke
,
and
then
she
left
poor
Lucy
in
no
mood
for
church
.
<EOS>
Would
she
have
been
in
a
better
mood
for
the
morning
service
<EOS>
had
she
known
of
the
letter
in
the
iron
post
?
  
<EOS>
Then
Lady
Fawn
had
put
on
her
bonnet
and
gone
down
into
the
hall
,
and
the
"
rumpus
"
had
come
.
<EOS>
After
that
,
everybody
in
the
house
knew
that
all
things
were
astray
.
<EOS>
When
the
girls
came
home
from
church
,
their
brother
was
gone
.
<EOS>
Half
an
hour
before
dinner
Lady
Fawn
sent
the
note
up
to
Lizzie
,
with
a
message
to
say
that
they
would
dine
at
three
,
 
it
being
Sunday
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
sent
down
word
that
as
she
was
unwell
,
she
would
ask
to
have
just
a
cup
of
tea
and
"
something
"
sent
to
her
own
room
.
<EOS>
If
Lady
Fawn
would
allow
her
,
she
would
remain
up
-
stairs
with
her
child
.
<EOS>
She
always
made
use
of
her
child
when
troubles
came
.
  
<EOS>
The
afternoon
was
very
sad
and
dreary
.
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
had
an
interview
with
Lady
Eustace
,
but
Lizzie
altogether
refused
to
listen
to
any
advice
on
the
subject
of
the
necklace
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
an
affair
,
"
she
said
haughtily
,
"
in
which
I
must
judge
for
myself
,
 
or
with
the
advice
of
my
own
particular
friends
.
<EOS>
Had
Lord
Fawn
waited
until
we
were
married
;
then
indeed
 
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
that
would
have
been
too
late
,
"
said
Lady
Fawn
severely
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
,
at
any
rate
,
premature
now
in
laying
his
commands
upon
me
,
"
said
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
,
who
was
perhaps
more
anxious
that
the
marriage
should
be
broken
off
than
that
the
jewels
should
be
restored
,
then
withdrew
;
and
as
she
left
the
room
Lizzie
clasped
her
boy
to
her
bosom
.
"
<EOS>
He
,
at
any
rate
,
is
left
to
me
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
Lucy
and
the
Fawn
girls
went
to
evening
church
,
and
afterwards
Lizzie
came
down
among
them
when
they
were
at
tea
.
<EOS>
Before
she
went
to
bed
Lizzie
declared
her
intention
of
returning
to
her
own
house
in
Mount
Street
on
the
following
day
.
<EOS>
To
this
Lady
Fawn
of
course
made
no
objection
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
next
morning
there
came
an
event
which
robbed
Lizzie
's
departure
of
some
of
the
importance
which
might
otherwise
have
been
attached
to
it
.
<EOS>
The
post
-
office
,
with
that
accuracy
in
the
performance
of
its
duties
for
which
it
is
conspicuous
among
all
offices
,
caused
Lucy
's
letter
to
be
delivered
to
her
while
the
members
of
the
family
were
sitting
round
the
breakfast
table
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
,
indeed
,
was
not
there
.
<EOS>
She
had
expressed
her
intention
of
breakfasting
in
her
own
room
,
and
had
requested
that
a
conveyance
might
be
ready
to
take
her
to
the
11.30
train
.
<EOS>
Augusta
had
been
with
her
,
asking
whether
anything
could
be
done
for
her
.
<EOS>
"
I
care
for
nothing
now
,
except
my
child
,
"
Lizzie
had
replied
.
<EOS>
As
the
nurse
and
the
lady
's
maid
were
both
in
the
room
,
Augusta
,
of
course
,
could
say
nothing
further
.
<EOS>
That
occurred
after
prayers
,
and
while
the
tea
was
being
made
.
<EOS>
When
Augusta
reached
the
breakfast
-
room
,
Lucy
was
cutting
up
the
loaf
of
bread
,
and
at
the
same
moment
the
old
butler
was
placing
a
letter
immediately
under
her
eyes
.
<EOS>
She
saw
the
handwriting
and
recognised
it
,
but
yet
she
finished
cutting
the
bread
.
<EOS>
"
Lucy
,
do
give
me
that
hunchy
bit
,
"
said
Nina
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hunchy
is
not
in
the
dictionary
,
"
said
Cecilia
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
want
it
in
my
plate
,
and
not
in
the
dictionary
,
"
said
Nina
.
  
<EOS>
Lucy
did
as
she
was
asked
,
but
her
hand
trembled
as
she
gave
the
hunch
,
and
Lady
Fawn
saw
that
her
face
was
crimson
.
<EOS>
She
took
the
letter
and
broke
the
envelope
,
and
as
she
drew
out
the
sheet
of
paper
,
she
looked
up
at
Lady
Fawn
.
<EOS>
The
fate
of
her
whole
life
was
in
her
hands
,
and
there
she
was
standing
with
all
their
eyes
fixed
upon
her
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
even
know
how
to
sit
down
,
but
,
still
standing
,
she
read
the
first
words
,
and
at
the
last
,
"
Dear
,
dear
Lucy
,
"
 
"
Yours
ever
and
always
,
if
you
will
have
me
,
F.
G.
<EOS>
"
She
did
not
want
to
read
any
more
of
it
then
.
<EOS>
She
sat
down
slowly
,
put
the
precious
paper
back
into
its
envelope
,
looked
round
upon
them
all
,
and
knew
that
she
was
crimson
to
the
roots
of
her
hair
,
blushing
like
a
guilty
thing
.
  
<EOS>
"
Lucy
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Lady
Fawn
,
 
and
Lucy
at
once
turned
her
face
full
upon
her
old
friend
,
 
"
you
have
got
a
letter
that
agitates
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
 
I
have
,
"
she
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
Go
into
the
book
-
room
.
<EOS>
You
can
come
back
to
breakfast
when
you
have
read
it
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
Thereupon
Lucy
rose
from
her
seat
,
and
retired
with
her
treasure
into
the
book
-
room
.
<EOS>
But
even
when
she
was
there
she
could
not
at
once
read
her
letter
.
<EOS>
When
the
door
was
closed
and
she
knew
that
she
was
alone
<EOS>
she
looked
at
it
,
and
then
clasped
it
tight
between
her
hands
.
<EOS>
She
was
almost
afraid
to
read
it
lest
the
letter
itself
should
contradict
the
promise
which
the
last
words
of
it
had
seemed
to
convey
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
went
up
to
the
window
and
stood
there
gazing
out
upon
the
gravel
road
,
with
her
hand
containing
the
letter
pressed
upon
her
heart
.
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
had
told
her
that
she
was
preparing
for
herself
inexpressible
misery
;
 
and
now
there
had
come
to
her
joy
so
absolutely
inexpressible
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
man
to
tell
you
that
he
loves
you
,
and
yet
not
ask
you
to
be
his
wife
!
"
<EOS>
She
repeated
to
herself
Lady
Fawn
's
words
,
 
and
then
those
other
words
,
"
Yours
ever
and
always
,
if
you
will
have
me
!
"
<EOS>
Have
him
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
She
threw
from
her
,
at
once
,
as
vain
and
wicked
and
false
,
all
idea
of
coying
her
love
.
<EOS>
She
would
leap
at
his
neck
if
he
were
there
,
and
tell
him
that
for
years
he
had
been
almost
her
god
.
<EOS>
And
of
course
he
knew
it
.
<EOS>
"
If
I
will
have
him
!
<EOS>
Traitor
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
said
to
herself
,
smiling
through
her
tears
.
<EOS>
Then
she
reflected
that
after
all
it
would
be
well
that
she
should
read
the
letter
.
<EOS>
There
might
be
conditions
;
 
though
what
conditions
could
he
propose
with
which
she
would
not
comply
?
<EOS>
However
,
she
seated
herself
in
a
corner
of
the
room
and
did
read
the
letter
.
<EOS>
As
she
read
it
,
she
hardly
understood
it
all
;
 
but
she
understood
what
she
wanted
to
understand
.
<EOS>
He
asked
her
to
share
with
him
his
home
.
<EOS>
He
had
spoken
to
her
that
day
without
forethought
;
 
but
must
n't
such
speech
be
the
truest
and
the
sweetest
of
all
speeches
?
"
<EOS>
And
now
I
write
to
you
to
ask
you
to
be
my
wife
.
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
how
wrong
some
people
can
be
in
their
judgments
!
<EOS>
How
wrong
Lady
Fawn
had
been
in
hers
about
Frank
Greystock
!
"
<EOS>
For
the
last
year
or
two
I
have
lived
with
this
hope
before
me
.
"
<EOS>
"
And
so
have
I
,
"
said
Lucy
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
so
have
I
;
 
with
that
and
no
other
.
"
<EOS>
"
Too
great
confidence
!
<EOS>
Traitor
,
"
she
said
again
,
smiling
and
weeping
,
"
yes
,
traitor
;
when
of
course
you
knew
it
.
"
<EOS>
"
Is
his
happiness
in
my
hands
?
<EOS>
Oh
,
 
then
he
shall
be
happy
.
"
<EOS>
"
Of
course
I
will
tell
Lady
Fawn
at
once
;
 
instantly
.
<EOS>
Dear
Lady
Fawn
!
<EOS>
But
yet
she
has
been
so
wrong
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
she
will
let
him
come
here
.
<EOS>
But
what
does
it
matter
,
now
that
I
know
it
?
"
<EOS>
"
Yours
ever
and
always
,
 
if
you
will
have
me
.
 
<EOS>
F.
G.
"
"
Traitor
,
traitor
,
traitor
!
"
<EOS>
Then
she
got
up
and
walked
about
the
room
,
not
knowing
what
she
did
,
holding
the
letter
now
between
her
hands
,
and
then
pressing
it
to
her
lips
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
still
walking
about
the
room
when
there
came
a
low
tap
at
the
door
,
and
Lady
Fawn
entered
.
<EOS>
"
There
is
nothing
the
matter
,
Lucy
?
"
<EOS>
Lucy
stood
stock
still
,
with
her
treasure
still
clasped
,
smiling
,
almost
laughing
,
while
the
tears
ran
down
her
cheeks
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Wo
n't
you
eat
your
breakfast
,
my
dear
?
"
said
Lady
Fawn
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Lady
Fawn
 
<EOS>
oh
,
Lady
Fawn
!
"
said
Lucy
,
rushing
into
her
friend
's
arms
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
it
,
Lucy
?
<EOS>
I
think
our
little
wise
one
has
lost
her
wits

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Lady
Fawn
,
he
has
asked
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
it
Mr.
Greystock
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
 
Mr.
Greystock
.
<EOS>
He
has
asked
me
.
<EOS>
He
has
asked
me
to
be
his
wife
.
<EOS>
I
thought
he
loved
me
.
<EOS>
I
hoped
he
did
,
at
least
.
<EOS>
Oh
dear
,
I
did
so
hope
it
!
<EOS>
And
he
does
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Has
he
proposed
to
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Lady
Fawn
.
<EOS>
I
told
you
what
he
said
to
me
.
<EOS>
And
then
he
went
and
wrote
this
.
<EOS>
Is
he
not
noble
and
good
,
 
and
so
kind
?
<EOS>
You
shall
read
it
,
 
but
you
'll
give
it
me
back
,
Lady
Fawn
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Certainly
I
'll
give
it
you
back
.
<EOS>
You
do
n't
think
I
'd
rob
you
of
your
lover
's
letter
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
you
might
think
it
right
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
it
is
really
an
offer
of
marriage
 
,
"
said
Lady
Fawn
very
seriously
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
could
n't
be
more
of
an
offer
if
he
had
sat
writing
it
for
ever
,
"
said
Lucy
as
she
gave
up
her
letter
with
confidence
.
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
read
it
with
leisurely
attention
,
and
smiled
as
she
put
the
paper
back
into
the
envelope
.
<EOS>
"
All
the
men
in
the
world
could
n't
say
it
more
plainly
,
"
said
Lucy
,
nodding
her
head
forward
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
they
could
,
"
said
Lady
Fawn
.
<EOS>
"
I
never
read
anything
plainer
in
my
life
.
<EOS>
I
wish
you
joy
with
all
my
heart
,
Lucy
.
<EOS>
There
is
not
a
word
to
be
said
against
him
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
Against
him
!
"
said
Lucy
,
who
thought
that
this
was
very
insufficient
praise
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
I
mean
is
,
that
when
I
objected
to
his
coming
here
<EOS>
I
was
only
afraid
that
he
could
n't
afford
,
 
or
would
think
,
you
know
,
that
in
his
position
he
could
n't
afford
to
marry
a
wife
without
a
fortune
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
may
come
now
,
Lady
Fawn
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
 
yes
;
I
think
so
.
<EOS>
I
shall
be
glad
just
to
say
a
word
to
him
.
<EOS>
Of
course
you
are
in
my
hands
,
and
I
do
love
you
so
dearly
,
Lucy
!
<EOS>
I
could
not
bear
that
anything
but
good
should
happen
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
This
is
good
,
"
said
Lucy
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
wo
n't
be
good
,
and
Mr.
Greystock
wo
n't
think
you
good
,
if
you
do
n't
come
and
eat
your
breakfast
.
"
<EOS>
So
Lucy
was
led
back
into
the
parlour
,
and
sipped
her
tea
and
crunched
her
toast
,
while
Lydia
came
and
stood
over
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
it
is
from
him
?
"
<EOS>
whispered
Lydia
.
<EOS>
Lucy
again
nodded
her
head
while
she
was
crunching
her
toast
.
  
<EOS>
The
fact
that
Mr.
Greystock
had
proposed
in
form
to
Lucy
Morris
was
soon
known
to
all
the
family
,
and
the
news
certainly
did
take
away
something
from
the
importance
which
would
otherwise
have
been
attached
to
Lizzie
's
departure
.
<EOS>
There
was
not
the
same
awe
of
the
ceremony
,
the
same
dread
of
some
scene
,
which
,
but
for
Frank
Greystock
's
letter
,
would
have
existed
.
<EOS>
Of
course
,
Lord
Fawn
's
future
matrimonial
prospects
were
to
them
all
an
affair
of
more
moment
than
those
of
Lucy
;
but
Lord
Fawn
himself
had
gone
,
and
had
already
quarrelled
with
the
lady
before
he
went
.
<EOS>
There
was
at
present
nothing
more
to
be
done
by
them
in
regard
to
Lizzie
,
than
just
to
get
rid
of
her
.
<EOS>
But
Lucy
's
good
fortune
,
so
unexpected
,
and
by
her
so
frankly
owned
as
the
very
best
fortune
in
the
world
that
could
have
befallen
her
,
gave
an
excitement
to
them
all
.
<EOS>
There
could
be
no
lessons
that
morning
for
Nina
,
and
the
usual
studies
of
the
family
were
altogether
interrupted
.
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
purred
,
and
congratulated
,
and
gave
good
advice
,
and
declared
that
any
other
home
for
Lucy
before
her
marriage
would
now
be
quite
out
of
the
question
.
<EOS>
"
Of
course
it
would
n't
do
for
you
to
go
even
to
Clara
,
"
said
Lady
Fawn
,
 
who
seemed
to
think
that
there
still
might
be
some
delay
before
Frank
Greystock
would
be
ready
for
his
wife
.
<EOS>
"
You
know
,
<EOS>
my
dear
,
that
he
is
n't
rich
;
 
not
for
a
member
of
Parliament
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
he
makes
a
good
income
,
but
I
have
always
heard
that
he
was
a
little
backward
when
he
began
.
<EOS>
Of
course
,
you
know
,
nobody
need
be
in
a
hurry
.
"
<EOS>
Then
Lucy
began
to
think
that
if
Frank
should
wish
to
postpone
his
marriage
,
 
say
for
three
or
four
years
,
 
she
might
even
yet
become
a
burthen
on
her
friend
.
"
<EOS>
But
do
n't
you
be
frightened
,
"
continued
Lady
Fawn
;
"
you
shall
never
want
a
home
as
long
as
I
have
one
to
give
you
.
<EOS>
We
shall
soon
find
out
what
are
Mr.
Greystock
's
ideas
;
and
unless
he
is
very
unreasonable
we
'll
make
things
fit
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Then
there
came
a
message
to
Lucy
from
Lady
Eustace
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
please
,
miss
,
Lady
Eustace
will
be
glad
to
see
you
for
a
minute
up
in
her
room
before
she
starts
.
"
<EOS>
So
Lucy
was
torn
away
from
the
thoughts
of
her
own
happiness
,
and
taken
up
-
stairs
to
Lady
Eustace
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
heard
that
I
am
going
?
"
said
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
 
I
heard
you
were
to
go
this
morning
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
have
heard
why
?
<EOS>
I
'm
sure
you
will
not
deceive
me
,
Lucy
.
<EOS>
Where
am
I
to
look
for
truth
,
if
not
to
an
old
,
old
friend
like
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
should
I
deceive
you
,
Lizzie
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
indeed
?
<EOS>
only
that
all
people
do
.
<EOS>
The
world
is
so
false
,
so
material
,
so
worldly
!
<EOS>
One
gives
out
one
's
heart
and
gets
in
return
nothing
but
dust
and
ashes
,
 
nothing
but
ashes
and
dust
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
I
have
been
so
disappointed
in
Lady
Fawn
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
she
is
my
dearest
friend
,
"
said
Lucy
.
  
<EOS>
"
Psha
!
<EOS>
I
know
that
you
have
worked
for
her
like
a
slave
,
and
that
she
gives
you
but
a
bare
pittance
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
has
been
more
like
a
mother
to
me
than
anything
else
,
"
said
Lucy
angrily
.
  
<EOS>
"
Because
you
have
been
tame
.
<EOS>
It
does
not
suit
me
to
be
tame
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
my
plan
to
be
tame
.
<EOS>
Have
you
heard
the
cause
of
the
disagreement
between
Lord
Fawn
and
me
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
 
no
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Tell
the
truth
,
Lucy
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
dare
you
tell
me
to
tell
the
truth
?
<EOS>
Of
course
I
tell
the
truth
.
<EOS>
I
believe
it
is
something
about
some
property
which
he
wants
you
to
give
back
to
somebody
;
but
I
do
n't
know
any
more
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
my
dear
husband
,
Sir
Florian
,
who
understood
me
,
 
whom
I
idolized
,
 
who
seemed
to
have
been
made
for
me
,
 
gave
me
a
present
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
is
pleased
to
say
that
he
does
not
approve
of
my
keeping
any
gift
from
my
late
lord
.
<EOS>
Considering
that
he
intends
to
live
upon
the
wealth
which
Sir
Florian
was
generous
enough
to
bestow
upon
me
,
this
does
seem
to
be
strange
!
<EOS>
Of
course
,
I
resented
such
interference
.
<EOS>
Would
not
you
have
resented
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
,
"
said
Lucy
,
who
thought
that
she
could
bring
herself
to
comply
with
any
request
made
to
her
by
Frank
Greystock
.
  
<EOS>
"
Any
woman
who
had
a
spark
of
spirit
would
resent
it
,
and
I
have
resented
it
.
<EOS>
I
have
told
Lord
Fawn
<EOS>
that
I
will
,
on
no
account
,
part
with
the
rich
presents
which
my
adored
Florian
showered
upon
me
in
his
generosity
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
for
their
richness
that
I
keep
them
,
but
because
they
are
,
for
his
sake
,
so
inexpressibly
dear
to
me
.
<EOS>
If
Lord
Fawn
chooses
to
be
jealous
of
a
necklace
,
he
must
be
jealous
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Lucy
,
who
had
,
in
truth
,
heard
but
a
small
fragment
of
the
story
,
 
just
so
much
of
it
as
Lydia
had
learned
from
the
discreet
Amelia
,
who
herself
had
but
a
very
hazy
idea
of
the
facts
,
 
did
not
quite
know
how
much
of
the
tale
,
as
it
was
now
told
to
her
,
might
be
true
and
how
much
false
.
<EOS>
After
a
certain
fashion
she
and
Lizzie
Eustace
called
themselves
friends
.
<EOS>
But
she
did
not
believe
her
friend
to
be
honest
,
and
was
aware
that
in
some
matters
her
friend
would
condescend
 
to
fib
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
's
poetry
,
and
romance
,
and
high
feelings
,
had
never
had
the
ring
of
true
soundness
in
Lucy
's
ears
.
<EOS>
But
her
imagination
was
not
strong
enough
to
soar
to
the
altitude
of
the
lies
which
Lizzie
was
now
telling
.
<EOS>
She
did
believe
that
the
property
which
Lizzie
was
called
upon
to
restore
was
held
to
be
objectionable
by
Lord
Fawn
simply
because
it
had
reached
Lizzie
from
the
hands
of
her
late
husband
.
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
think
of
such
conduct
as
that
?
"
asked
Lady
Eustace
.
  
<EOS>
"
Wo
n't
it
do
if
you
lock
them
up
instead
of
wearing
them
?
"
asked
Lucy
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
never
dreamed
of
wearing
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
understand
about
such
things
,
"
said
Lucy
,
determined
not
to
impute
any
blame
to
one
of
the
Fawn
family
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
tyranny
,
sheer
tyranny
,
"
continued
the
other
,
"
and
he
will
find
that
I
am
not
the
woman
to
yield
to
it
.
<EOS>
No
.
<EOS>
For
love
I
could
give
up
everything
;
 
but
nothing
from
fear
.
<EOS>
He
has
told
me
in
so
many
words
that
he
does
not
intend
to
go
on
with
his
engagement
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Has
he
indeed
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
intend
that
he
shall
.
<EOS>
If
he
thinks
that
I
am
going
to
be
thrown
over
because
he
takes
ideas
of
that
kind
into
his
head
,
he
's
mistaken
.
<EOS>
He
shall
know
that
I
'm
not
to
be
made
a
plaything
of
like
that
.
<EOS>
I
'll
tell
you
what
you
can
do
for
me
,
Lucy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
can
I
do
for
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
no
one
in
the
world
I
trust
more
thoroughly
than
I
do
you
,
"
said
Lizzie
,
 
"
and
hardly
any
one
that
I
love
so
well
.
<EOS>
Think
how
long
we
have
known
each
other
!
<EOS>
And
you
may
be
sure
of
this
;
 
I
always
have
been
,
and
always
will
be
,
your
friend
with
my
cousin
Frank
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
want
anything
of
that
kind
,
"
said
Lucy
,
 
"
and
never
did
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nobody
has
so
much
influence
with
Frank
as
I.
<EOS>
Just
do
you
write
to
me
to
-
morrow
,
and
<EOS>
the
next
day
,
 
and
the
day
after
,
 
a
mere
line
,
you
know
,
to
tell
me
how
the
land
lies
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
would
be
nothing
to
tell
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Yes
,
there
will
;
ever
so
much
.
<EOS>
They
will
be
talking
about
me
every
hour
.
<EOS>
If
you
'll
be
true
to
me
,
Lucy
,
in
this
business
,
I
'll
make
you
the
handsomest
present
you
ever
saw
in
your
life
.
<EOS>
I
'll
give
you
a
hundred
-
guinea
brooch
;
 
I
will
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
You
shall
have
the
money
,
and
buy
it
yourself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
what
!
"
said
Lucy
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
hundred
guineas
to
do
what
you
please
with
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
mean
thing
!
"
said
Lucy
.
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
think
there
was
a
woman
<EOS>
so
mean
as
that
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
I
'm
not
surprised
now
at
Lord
Fawn
.
<EOS>
Pick
up
what
I
hear
,
and
send
it
you
in
letters
,
 
and
then
be
paid
money
for
it
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
not
?
<EOS>
It
's
all
to
do
good
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
can
you
have
thought
to
ask
me
to
do
such
a
thing
?
<EOS>
How
can
you
bring
yourself
to
think
so
badly
of
people
?
<EOS>
I
'd
sooner
cut
my
hand
off
;
and
as
for
you
,
Lizzie
 
<EOS>
I
think
you
are
mean
and
wicked
to
conceive
such
a
thing
.
<EOS>
And
now
good
-
bye
.
"
<EOS>
So
saying
,
she
left
the
room
,
giving
her
dear
friend
no
time
for
further
argument
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Eustace
got
away
that
morning
,
not
in
time
,
indeed
,
for
the
11.30
train
,
but
at
such
an
hour
as
to
make
it
unnecessary
that
she
should
appear
at
the
early
dinner
.
<EOS>
The
saying
of
farewell
was
very
cold
and
ceremonious
.
<EOS>
Of
course
,
there
was
no
word
as
to
any
future
visit
,
 
<EOS>
no
word
as
to
any
future
events
<EOS>
whatever
.
<EOS>
They
all
shook
hands
with
her
,
and
special
injunctions
were
given
to
the
coachman
to
drive
her
safely
to
the
station
.
<EOS>
At
this
ceremony
Lucy
was
not
present
.
<EOS>
Lydia
had
asked
her
to
come
down
and
say
good
-
bye
;
but
Lucy
refused
.
<EOS>
"
I
saw
her
in
her
own
room
,
"
said
Lucy
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
was
it
all
very
affectionate
?
"
<EOS>
Lydia
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
 
no
;
it
was
not
affectionate
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
This
was
all
that
Lucy
said
,
and
thus
Lady
Eustace
completed
her
visit
to
Fawn
Court
.
  
<EOS>
The
letters
were
taken
away
for
the
post
at
eight
o'clock
in
the
evening
,
and
before
that
time
it
was
necessary
that
Lucy
should
write
to
her
lover
.
"
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
,
"
she
said
in
a
whisper
,
"
may
I
tell
him
to
come
here
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Certainly
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
You
had
better
tell
him
to
call
on
me
.
<EOS>
Of
course
he
'll
see
you
,
too
,
when
he
comes
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
he
'd
want
to
see
me
,
"
said
Lucy
,
"
<EOS>
and
I
'm
sure
I
should
want
to
see
him
!
"
<EOS>
Then
she
wrote
her
answer
to
Frank
's
letter
.
<EOS>
She
allowed
herself
an
hour
for
the
happy
task
;
but
though
the
letter
,
when
written
,
was
short
,
the
hour
hardly
sufficed
for
the
writing
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
DEAR
MR
.
GREYSTOCK
;
"
 
there
was
matter
for
her
of
great
consideration
before
she
could
get
even
so
far
as
this
;
but
,
after
biting
her
pen
for
ten
minutes
,
during
which
she
pictured
to
herself
how
pleasant
it
would
be
to
call
him
Frank
when
he
should
have
told
her
to
do
so
,
and
had
found
,
upon
repeated
whispered
trials
,
that
of
all
names
it
was
the
pleasantest
to
pronounce
<EOS>
,
she
decided
upon
refraining
from
writing
it
now
    
Lady
Fawn
has
seen
your
letter
to
me
,
 
the
dearest
letter
that
ever
was
written
,
 
and
<EOS>
she
says
that
you
may
call
upon
_
her
_
.
<EOS>
But
you
must
n't
go
away
without
seeing
_
me
too
_
.
  
<EOS>
Then
there
was
great
difficulty
as
to
the
words
to
be
used
by
her
for
the
actual
rendering
herself
up
to
him
as
his
future
wife
.
<EOS>
At
last
the
somewhat
too
Spartan
simplicity
of
her
nature
prevailed
,
and
the
words
were
written
,
very
plain
and
very
short
.
  
<EOS>
I
love
you
better
than
all
the
world
,
and
I
will
be
your
wife
.
<EOS>
It
shall
be
the
happiness
of
my
life
to
try
to
deserve
you
.
  
<EOS>
I
am
,
with
all
my
heart
,
Most
affectionately
your
own
  
LUCY
.
  
<EOS>
When
it
was
written
it
did
not
content
her
.
<EOS>
But
the
hour
was
over
,
and
the
letters
must
go
.
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
it
'll
do
,
"
she
said
to
herself
.
"
<EOS>
He
'll
know
what
it
means
.
"
<EOS>
And
so
the
letter
was
sent
.
   
<EOS>
Certainly
an
Heirloom
 
<EOS>
The
burden
of
his
position
was
so
heavy
on
Lord
Fawn
's
mind
that
,
on
the
Monday
morning
after
leaving
Fawn
Court
,
he
was
hardly
as
true
to
the
affairs
of
India
as
he
himself
would
have
wished
.
<EOS>
He
was
resolved
to
do
what
was
right
,
 
if
only
he
could
find
out
what
would
be
the
right
thing
in
his
present
difficulty
.
<EOS>
Not
to
break
his
word
,
not
to
be
unjust
,
not
to
deviate
by
a
hair
's
breadth
from
that
line
of
conduct
which
would
be
described
as
"
honourable
"
in
the
circle
to
which
he
belonged
;
not
to
give
his
political
enemies
an
opportunity
for
calumny
,
 
this
was
all
in
all
to
him
.
<EOS>
The
young
widow
was
very
lovely
and
very
rich
,
and
it
would
have
suited
him
well
to
marry
her
.
<EOS>
It
would
still
suit
him
well
to
do
so
,
if
she
would
make
herself
amenable
to
reason
and
the
laws
.
<EOS>
He
had
assured
himself
that
he
was
very
much
in
love
with
her
,
and
had
already
,
in
his
imagination
,
received
the
distinguished
heads
of
his
party
at
Portray
Castle
.
<EOS>
But
he
would
give
all
this
up
,
 
love
,
income
,
beauty
,
and
castle
,
 
without
a
doubt
,
rather
than
find
himself
in
the
mess
of
having
married
a
wife
who
had
stolen
a
necklace
,
and
who
would
not
make
restitution
.
<EOS>
He
might
marry
her
,
and
insist
on
giving
it
up
afterwards
;
but
he
foresaw
terrible
difficulties
in
the
way
of
such
an
arrangement
.
<EOS>
Lady
Eustace
was
self
-
willed
,
and
had
already
told
him
that
she
did
not
intend
to
keep
the
jewels
in
his
house
,
 
but
in
her
own
!
<EOS>
What
should
he
do
,
so
that
no
human
being
,
 
not
the
most
bigoted
Tory
that
ever
expressed
scorn
for
a
Whig
lord
,
 
should
be
able
to
say
that
he
had
done
wrong
?
<EOS>
He
was
engaged
to
the
lady
,
and
could
not
simply
change
his
mind
and
give
no
reason
.
<EOS>
He
believed
in
Mr.
Camperdown
;
but
he
could
hardly
plead
that
belief
,
should
he
hereafter
be
accused
of
heartless
misconduct
.
<EOS>
For
aught
he
knew
,
Lady
Eustace
might
bring
an
action
against
him
for
breach
of
promise
,
and
obtain
a
verdict
and
damages
,
and
annihilate
him
as
an
Under
-
Secretary
.
<EOS>
How
should
he
keep
his
hands
quite
clean
?
  
<EOS>
Frank
Greystock
was
,
as
far
as
he
knew
,
Lizzie
's
nearest
relative
in
London
.
<EOS>
The
dean
was
her
uncle
,
but
then
the
dean
was
down
at
Bobsborough
.
<EOS>
It
might
be
necessary
for
him
to
go
down
to
Bobsborough
;
 
but
in
the
meantime
he
would
see
Frank
Greystock
.
<EOS>
Greystock
was
as
bitter
a
Tory
as
any
in
England
.
<EOS>
Greystock
was
the
very
man
who
had
attacked
him
,
Lord
Fawn
,
in
the
House
of
Commons
respecting
the
Sawab
,
 
making
the
attack
quite
personal
,
 
and
that
without
a
shadow
of
a
cause
!
<EOS>
Within
the
short
straight
grooves
of
Lord
Fawn
's
intellect
the
remembrance
of
this
supposed
wrong
was
always
running
up
and
down
,
renewing
its
own
soreness
.
<EOS>
He
regarded
Greystock
as
an
enemy
who
would
lose
no
opportunity
of
injuring
him
.
<EOS>
In
his
weakness
and
littleness
he
was
quite
unable
to
judge
of
other
men
by
himself
.
<EOS>
He
would
not
go
a
hair
's
breadth
astray
,
if
he
knew
it
;
but
because
Greystock
had
,
in
debate
,
called
him
timid
and
tyrannical
,
he
believed
that
Greystock
would
stop
short
of
nothing
that
might
injure
him
.
<EOS>
And
yet
he
must
appeal
to
Greystock
.
<EOS>
He
did
appeal
,
and
in
answer
to
his
appeal
<EOS>
Frank
came
to
him
at
the
India
House
.
<EOS>
But
Frank
,
before
he
saw
Lord
Fawn
,
had
,
as
was
fitting
,
been
with
his
cousin
.
  
<EOS>
Nothing
was
decided
at
this
interview
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
became
more
than
ever
convinced
that
the
member
for
Bobsborough
was
his
determined
enemy
,
and
Frank
was
more
convinced
than
ever
that
Lord
Fawn
was
an
empty
,
stiff
-
necked
,
self
-
sufficient
prig
.
  
<EOS>
Greystock
,
of
course
,
took
his
cousin
's
part
.
<EOS>
He
was
there
to
do
so
;
and
he
himself
really
did
not
know
whether
Lizzie
was
or
was
not
entitled
to
the
diamonds
.
<EOS>
The
lie
which
she
had
first
fabricated
for
the
benefit
of
Mr.
Benjamin
when
she
had
the
jewels
valued
,
and
which
she
had
since
told
with
different
degrees
of
precision
to
various
people
,
 
to
Lady
Linlithgow
,
to
Mr.
Camperdown
,
to
Lucy
,
and
to
Lord
Fawn
,
 
<EOS>
she
now
repeated
with
increased
precision
to
her
cousin
.
<EOS>
Sir
Florian
,
in
putting
the
trinket
into
her
hands
,
had
explained
to
her
that
it
was
very
valuable
,
and
that
she
was
to
regard
it
as
her
own
peculiar
property
.
<EOS>
"
If
it
was
an
heirloom
he
could
n't
do
it
,
"
Frank
had
said
,
with
all
the
confidence
of
a
practising
barrister
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
made
it
over
as
an
heirloom
to
me
,
"
said
Lizzie
,
with
plaintive
tenderness
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
nonsense
,
dear
Lizzie
.
"
<EOS>
Then
she
smiled
sweetly
on
him
,
and
patted
the
back
of
his
hand
with
hers
.
<EOS>
She
was
very
gentle
with
him
,
and
bore
his
assumed
superiority
with
pretty
meekness
.
"
<EOS>
He
could
not
make
it
over
as
an
heirloom
to
you
.
<EOS>
If
it
was
his
to
give
,
he
could
give
it
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
his
,
 
certainly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
just
what
I
can
not
tell
as
yet
,
and
what
must
be
found
out
.
<EOS>
If
the
diamonds
formed
part
of
an
heirloom
,
 
and
there
is
evidence
that
it
is
so
,
 
you
must
give
them
up
.
<EOS>
Sir
Florian
could
only
give
away
what
was
his
own
to
give
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
Lord
Fawn
had
no
right
to
dictate
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Certainly
not
,
"
said
Frank
;
and
then
he
made
a
promise
,
which
he
knew
to
be
rash
,
that
he
would
stand
by
his
pretty
cousin
in
this
affair
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
see
why
you
should
assume
that
Lady
Eustace
is
keeping
property
that
does
n't
belong
to
her
,
"
he
said
to
Lord
Fawn
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
go
by
what
Camperdown
tells
me
,
"
said
Lord
Fawn
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Camperdown
is
a
very
excellent
attorney
,
and
a
most
respectable
man
,
"
said
Greystock
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
nothing
on
earth
to
say
against
Mr.
Camperdown
.
<EOS>
But
Mr.
Camperdown
is
n't
the
law
and
the
prophets
,
nor
yet
can
we
allow
him
to
be
judge
and
jury
in
such
a
case
as
this
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Surely
,
Mr.
Greystock
,
you
would
n't
wish
it
to
go
before
a
jury
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
understand
me
,
Lord
Fawn
.
<EOS>
If
any
claim
be
really
made
for
these
jewels
by
Mr.
John
Eustace
on
the
part
of
the
heir
,
or
on
behalf
of
the
estate
,
a
statement
had
better
be
submitted
to
counsel
.
<EOS>
The
family
deeds
must
be
inspected
,
and
no
doubt
counsel
would
agree
in
telling
my
cousin
,
Lady
Eustace
,
what
she
should
,
or
what
she
should
not
do
.
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
,
I
understand
that
you
are
engaged
to
marry
her
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
engaged
to
her
,
certainly
,
"
said
Lord
Fawn
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
can
hardly
mean
to
assert
,
my
lord
,
that
you
intend
to
be
untrue
to
your
promise
,
and
to
throw
over
your
own
engagement
because
my
cousin
has
expressed
her
wish
to
retain
property
which
she
believes
to
be
her
own
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
This
was
said
in
a
tone
which
made
Lord
Fawn
surer
than
ever
that
Greystock
was
his
enemy
to
the
knife
.
<EOS>
Personally
,
he
was
not
a
coward
;
and
he
knew
enough
of
the
world
to
be
quite
sure
that
Greystock
would
not
attempt
any
personal
encounter
.
<EOS>
But
morally
,
Lord
Fawn
was
a
coward
,
and
he
did
fear
that
the
man
before
him
would
work
him
some
bitter
injury
.
<EOS>
"
You
can
not
mean
that
,
"
continued
Frank
,
"
and
you
will
probably
allow
me
to
assure
my
cousin
that
she
misunderstood
you
in
the
matter
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'd
sooner
see
Mr.
Camperdown
again
before
I
say
anything
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
understand
,
Lord
Fawn
,
that
a
gentleman
should
require
an
attorney
to
tell
him
what
to
do
in
such
a
case
as
this
.
<EOS>
"
They
were
standing
now
,
and
Lord
Fawn
's
countenance
was
heavy
,
troubled
,
and
full
of
doubt
.
<EOS>
He
said
nothing
,
and
was
probably
altogether
unaware
how
eloquent
was
his
face
.
<EOS>
"
My
cousin
,
Lady
Eustace
,
"
continued
Frank
,
"
must
not
be
kept
in
this
suspense
.
<EOS>
I
agree
on
her
behalf
that
her
title
to
these
trinkets
must
be
made
the
subject
of
inquiry
by
persons
adequate
to
form
a
judgment
.
<EOS>
Of
course
,
I
,
as
her
relative
,
shall
take
no
part
in
that
inquiry
.
<EOS>
But
,
as
her
relative
,
I
must
demand
from
you
an
admission
that
your
engagement
with
her
can
not
in
any
way
be
allowed
to
depend
on
the
fate
of
those
jewels
.
<EOS>
She
has
chosen
to
accept
you
as
her
future
husband
,
and
I
am
bound
to
see
that
she
is
treated
with
good
faith
,
honour
,
and
fair
observance
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Frank
made
his
demand
very
well
,
while
Lord
Fawn
was
looking
like
a
whipped
dog
.
<EOS>
"
Of
course
,
"
said
his
lordship
,
"
all
I
want
is
,
that
the
right
thing
should
be
done
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
right
thing
will
be
done
.
<EOS>
My
cousin
wishes
to
keep
nothing
that
is
not
her
own
.
<EOS>
I
may
tell
her
,
then
,
that
she
will
receive
from
you
an
assurance
that
you
have
had
no
intention
of
departing
from
your
word
?
"
<EOS>
After
this
,
Lord
Fawn
made
some
attempt
at
a
stipulation
that
this
assurance
to
Lizzie
was
to
be
founded
on
the
counter
-
assurance
given
to
him
that
the
matter
of
the
diamonds
should
be
decided
by
proper
legal
authority
;
but
Frank
would
not
submit
to
this
,
and
at
last
the
Under
-
Secretary
yielded
.
<EOS>
The
engagement
was
to
remain
in
force
.
<EOS>
Counsel
were
to
be
employed
.
<EOS>
The
two
lovers
were
not
to
see
each
other
just
at
present
.
<EOS>
And
when
the
matter
had
been
decided
by
the
lawyers
,
Lord
Fawn
was
to
express
his
regret
for
having
suspected
his
lady
-
love
!
<EOS>
That
was
the
verbal
agreement
,
according
to
Frank
Greystock
's
view
of
it
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
,
no
doubt
,
would
have
declared
that
he
had
never
consented
to
the
latter
stipulation
.
  
<EOS>
About
a
week
after
this
there
was
a
meeting
at
Mr.
Camperdown
's
chambers
.
<EOS>
Greystock
,
as
his
cousin
's
friend
,
attended
to
hear
what
Mr.
Camperdown
had
to
say
in
the
presence
of
Lord
Fawn
and
John
Eustace
.
<EOS>
He
,
Frank
,
had
,
in
the
meantime
,
been
down
to
Richmond
,
had
taken
Lucy
to
his
arms
as
his
future
bride
,
and
had
been
closeted
with
Lady
Fawn
.
<EOS>
As
a
man
who
was
doing
his
duty
by
Lucy
Morris
,
he
was
welcomed
and
made
much
of
by
her
ladyship
;
but
it
had
been
impossible
to
leave
Lizzie
's
name
altogether
unmentioned
,
and
Frank
had
spoken
as
the
champion
of
his
cousin
.
<EOS>
Of
course
there
had
arisen
something
of
ill
-
feeling
between
the
two
.
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
had
taught
herself
to
hate
Lizzie
,
and
was
desirous
that
the
match
should
be
over
,
diamonds
or
no
diamonds
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
quite
say
this
to
her
visitor
,
but
she
showed
her
feeling
very
plainly
.
<EOS>
Frank
was
courteous
,
cold
,
and
resolute
in
presuming
,
or
pretending
to
presume
,
that
as
a
matter
of
course
the
marriage
would
take
place
.
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
intended
to
be
civil
,
but
she
could
not
restrain
her
feeling
;
and
though
she
did
not
dare
to
say
that
her
son
would
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
Lizzie
Eustace
,
she
showed
very
plainly
that
she
intended
to
work
with
that
object
.
<EOS>
Of
course
,
the
two
did
not
part
as
cordial
friends
,
and
of
course
poor
Lucy
perceived
that
it
was
so
.
  
<EOS>
Before
the
meeting
took
place
,
Mr.
Camperdown
had
been
at
work
,
looking
over
old
deeds
.
<EOS>
It
is
undoubtedly
the
case
that
things
often
become
complicated
which
,
from
the
greatness
of
their
importance
,
should
have
been
kept
clear
as
running
water
.
<EOS>
The
diamonds
in
question
had
been
bought
,
with
other
jewels
,
by
Sir
Florian
's
grandfather
,
on
the
occasion
of
his
marriage
with
the
daughter
of
a
certain
duke
,
 
on
which
occasion
old
family
jewels
,
which
were
said
to
have
been
heirlooms
,
were
sold
or
given
in
exchange
as
part
value
for
those
then
purchased
.
<EOS>
This
grandfather
,
who
had
also
been
Sir
Florian
in
his
time
,
had
expressly
stated
in
his
will
that
these
jewels
were
to
be
regarded
as
an
heirloom
in
the
family
,
and
had
as
such
left
them
to
his
eldest
son
,
and
to
that
son
's
eldest
son
,
should
such
a
child
be
born
.
<EOS>
His
eldest
son
had
possessed
them
,
but
not
that
son
's
son
.
<EOS>
There
was
such
an
Eustace
born
,
but
he
had
died
before
his
father
.
<EOS>
The
younger
son
of
that
old
Sir
Florian
had
then
succeeded
,
as
Sir
Thomas
,
and
he
was
the
father
of
that
Florian
who
had
married
Lizzie
Eustace
.
<EOS>
That
last
Sir
Florian
had
therefore
been
the
fourth
in
succession
from
the
old
Sir
Florian
by
whom
the
will
had
been
made
,
and
who
had
directed
that
these
jewels
should
be
regarded
as
heirlooms
in
the
family
.
<EOS>
The
two
intermediate
baronets
had
made
no
allusion
to
the
diamonds
in
any
deeds
executed
by
them
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
Sir
Florian
's
father
had
died
without
a
will
.
<EOS>
There
were
other
jewels
,
larger
but
much
less
valuable
than
the
diamonds
,
still
in
the
hands
of
the
Messrs.
Garnett
,
as
to
which
no
question
was
raised
.
<EOS>
The
late
Sir
Florian
had
,
by
his
will
,
left
all
the
property
in
his
house
at
Portray
to
his
widow
,
but
all
property
elsewhere
to
his
heir
.
<EOS>
This
was
what
Mr.
Camperdown
had
at
last
learned
,
but
he
had
been
forced
to
admit
to
himself
,
while
learning
this
,
that
there
was
confusion
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
confident
enough
,
however
,
that
there
was
no
difficulty
in
the
matter
.
<EOS>
The
Messrs.
Garnett
were
able
to
say
that
the
necklace
had
been
in
their
keeping
,
with
various
other
jewels
still
in
their
possession
,
from
the
time
of
the
death
of
the
late
Lady
Eustace
,
up
to
the
marriage
of
the
late
Sir
Florian
,
her
son
.
<EOS>
They
stated
the
date
on
which
the
jewels
were
given
up
to
be
the
24th
of
September
,
which
was
the
day
after
Sir
Florian
's
return
from
Scotland
with
his
bride
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
's
first
statement
had
coincided
with
this
entry
in
the
Messrs.
Garnett
's
books
;
but
latterly
she
had
asserted
that
the
necklace
had
been
given
to
her
in
Scotland
.
<EOS>
When
Mr.
Camperdown
examined
the
entry
himself
in
the
jewellers
"
book
,
he
found
the
figures
to
be
so
blotted
that
they
might
represent
either
the
4th
or
24th
September
.
<EOS>
Now
,
the
4th
September
had
been
the
day
preceding
Sir
Florian
's
marriage
.
<EOS>
John
Eustace
only
knew
that
he
had
seen
the
necklace
worn
in
Scotland
by
his
mother
.
<EOS>
The
bishop
only
knew
that
he
had
often
seen
them
on
the
neck
of
his
sister
-
in
-
law
when
,
as
was
very
often
the
case
,
she
appeared
in
full
-
blown
society
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Camperdown
believed
that
he
had
traced
two
stories
to
Lizzie
,
 
one
,
repeated
more
than
once
,
that
the
diamonds
had
been
given
to
her
in
London
,
and
a
second
,
made
to
himself
,
that
they
had
been
given
to
her
at
Portray
.
<EOS>
He
himself
believed
that
they
had
never
been
in
Scotland
since
the
death
of
the
former
Lady
Eustace
;
but
he
was
quite
confident
that
he
could
trust
altogether
to
the
disposition
made
of
them
by
the
old
Sir
Florian
.
<EOS>
There
could
be
no
doubt
as
to
these
being
the
diamonds
there
described
,
although
the
setting
had
been
altered
.
<EOS>
Old
Mr.
Garnett
stated
that
he
would
swear
to
them
if
he
saw
the
necklace
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
can
not
suppose
that
Lady
Eustace
wishes
to
keep
anything
that
is
not
her
own
,
"
said
Frank
Greystock
.
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
not
,
"
said
John
Eustace
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nobody
imagines
it
,
"
said
Mr.
Camperdown
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
,
who
felt
that
he
ought
not
to
be
there
,
and
who
did
not
know
whether
he
might
with
a
better
grace
take
Lizzie
's
part
or
a
part
against
her
,
said
nothing
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
,
"
continued
Mr.
Camperdown
,
"
there
is
luckily
no
doubt
as
to
the
facts
.
<EOS>
The
diamonds
in
question
formed
a
part
of
a
set
of
most
valuable
ornaments
settled
in
the
family
by
Sir
Florian
Eustace
in
1799
.
<EOS>
The
deed
was
drawn
up
by
my
grandfather
,
and
is
now
here
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
how
we
are
to
have
further
proof
.
<EOS>
Will
you
look
at
the
deed
,
Mr.
Greystock
,
and
at
the
will
?
"
<EOS>
Frank
suggested
that
,
as
it
might
probably
be
expedient
to
take
advice
on
the
subject
professionally
,
he
had
rather
not
look
at
the
deed
.
<EOS>
Anything
which
he
might
say
,
on
looking
at
the
document
now
,
could
have
no
weight
.
<EOS>
"
But
why
should
any
advice
be
necessary
,
"
said
Mr.
Camperdown
,
"
when
the
matter
is
so
clear
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
sir
,
"
said
Frank
,
"
<EOS>
my
cousin
,
Lady
Eustace
,
is
strong
in
her
confidence
that
her
late
husband
intended
to
give
them
to
her
as
her
own
,
and
that
he
would
not
have
done
this
without
the
power
of
doing
so
.
"
<EOS>
Now
,
Mr.
Camperdown
was
quite
sure
that
Lizzie
was
lying
in
this
,
and
could
therefore
make
no
adequate
answer
.
<EOS>
"
Your
experience
must
probably
have
told
you
,
"
continued
Frank
,
"
that
there
is
considerable
difficulty
in
dealing
with
the
matter
of
heirlooms
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
heard
of
any
such
difficulty
,
"
said
Mr.
Camperdown
.
  
<EOS>
"
People
generally
understand
it
all
so
clearly
,
"
said
Lord
Fawn
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
late
Sir
Florian
does
not
appear
to
have
understood
it
very
clearly
,
"
said
Frank
.
  
<EOS>
"
Let
her
put
them
into
the
hands
of
any
indifferent
person
or
firm
till
the
matter
is
decided
,
"
said
Mr.
Camperdown
.
<EOS>
"
They
will
be
much
safer
so
than
in
her
keeping
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
they
are
quite
safe
,
"
said
Frank
.
  
<EOS>
And
this
was
all
that
took
place
at
that
meeting
.
<EOS>
As
Mr.
Camperdown
said
to
John
Eustace
,
it
was
manifest
enough
that
she
meant
"
to
hang
on
to
them
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
only
hope
Lord
Fawn
will
not
be
fool
enough
to
marry
her
,
"
said
Mr.
Camperdown
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
himself
was
of
the
same
way
of
thinking
;
 
but
then
how
was
he
to
clear
his
character
of
the
charge
which
would
be
brought
against
him
;
and
how
was
he
to
stand
his
ground
before
Frank
Greystock
?
   
<EOS>
The
Diamonds
Are
Seen
in
Public
 
<EOS>
Let
it
not
be
supposed
that
Lady
Eustace
,
during
these
summer
weeks
,
was
living
the
life
of
a
recluse
.
<EOS>
The
London
season
was
in
its
full
splendour
,
and
she
was
by
no
means
a
recluse
.
<EOS>
During
the
first
year
of
her
widowhood
she
had
been
every
inch
a
widow
,
 
as
far
as
crape
would
go
,
and
a
quiet
life
either
at
Bobsborough
or
Portray
Castle
.
<EOS>
During
this
year
her
child
was
born
,
 
and
she
was
in
every
way
thrown
upon
her
good
behaviour
,
living
with
bishops
"
wives
and
deans
'
daughters
.
<EOS>
Two
years
of
retreat
from
the
world
is
generally
thought
to
be
the
proper
thing
for
a
widow
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
had
not
quite
accomplished
her
two
years
before
she
re
-
opened
the
campaign
in
Mount
Street
with
very
small
remnants
of
weeds
,
and
with
her
crape
brought
down
to
a
minimum
;
 
but
she
was
young
and
rich
,
and
the
world
is
aware
that
a
woman
of
twenty
-
two
can
hardly
afford
to
sacrifice
two
whole
years
.
<EOS>
In
the
matter
of
her
widowhood
<EOS>
Lizzie
did
not
encounter
very
much
reproach
.
<EOS>
She
was
not
shunned
,
or
so
ill
spoken
of
as
to
have
a
widely
-
spread
bad
name
among
the
streets
and
squares
in
which
her
carriage
-
wheels
rolled
.
<EOS>
People
called
her
a
flirt
,
held
up
their
hands
in
surprise
at
Sir
Florian
's
foolish
generosity
,
 
for
the
accounts
of
Lizzie
's
wealth
were
greatly
exaggerated
,
 
and
said
that
of
course
she
would
marry
again
.
  
<EOS>
The
general
belief
which
often
seizes
upon
the
world
in
regard
to
some
special
falsehood
is
very
surprising
.
<EOS>
Everybody
on
a
sudden
adopts
an
idea
that
some
particular
man
is
over
head
and
ears
in
debt
,
so
that
he
can
hardly
leave
his
house
for
fear
of
the
bailiffs
;
 
or
that
some
ill
-
fated
woman
is
cruelly
ill
-
used
by
her
husband
;
 
or
that
some
eldest
son
has
ruined
his
father
;
whereas
the
man
does
n't
owe
a
shilling
,
the
woman
never
hears
a
harsh
word
from
her
lord
,
and
the
eldest
son
in
question
has
never
succeeded
in
obtaining
a
shilling
beyond
his
allowance
.
<EOS>
One
of
the
lies
about
London
this
season
was
founded
on
the
extent
of
Lady
Eustace
's
jointure
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
the
lie
went
on
to
state
that
the
jointure
was
more
than
a
jointure
.
<EOS>
It
was
believed
that
the
property
in
Ayrshire
was
her
own
,
to
do
what
she
pleased
with
it
.
<EOS>
That
the
property
in
Ayrshire
was
taken
<EOS>
at
double
its
value
was
a
matter
of
course
.
<EOS>
It
had
been
declared
,
at
the
time
of
his
marriage
,
that
Sir
Florian
had
been
especially
generous
to
his
penniless
wife
,
and
the
generosity
was
magnified
in
the
ordinary
way
.
<EOS>
No
doubt
Lizzie
's
own
diligence
had
done
much
to
propagate
the
story
as
to
her
positive
ownership
of
Portray
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Camperdown
had
been
very
busy
denying
this
.
<EOS>
John
Eustace
had
denied
it
whenever
occasion
offered
.
<EOS>
The
bishop
in
his
quiet
way
had
denied
it
.
<EOS>
Lady
Linlithgow
had
denied
it
.
<EOS>
But
the
lie
had
been
set
on
foot
and
had
thriven
,
and
there
was
hardly
a
man
about
town
who
did
n't
know
that
Lady
Eustace
had
eight
or
nine
thousand
a
year
,
altogether
at
her
own
disposal
,
down
in
Scotland
.
<EOS>
Of
course
a
woman
so
endowed
,
so
rich
,
so
beautiful
,
so
clever
,
so
young
,
would
marry
again
,
and
would
marry
well
.
<EOS>
No
doubt
,
added
to
this
there
was
a
feeling
that
"
Lizzie
,
"
as
she
was
not
uncommonly
called
by
people
who
had
hardly
ever
seen
her
,
had
something
amiss
with
it
all
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
where
it
is
she
's
lame
,
"
said
that
very
clever
man
,
Captain
Boodle
,
who
had
lately
reappeared
among
his
military
friends
at
his
club
,
"
but
<EOS>
she
do
n't
go
flat
all
round
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
has
the
devil
of
a
temper
,
no
doubt
,
"
said
Lieutenant
Griggs
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
mouth
,
I
should
say
,
"
said
Boodle
.
<EOS>
It
was
thus
that
Lizzie
was
talked
about
at
the
clubs
;
but
she
was
asked
to
dinners
and
balls
,
and
gave
little
dinners
herself
,
and
to
a
certain
extent
was
the
fashion
.
<EOS>
Everybody
had
declared
that
of
course
she
would
marry
again
,
and
now
it
was
known
everywhere
that
she
was
engaged
to
Lord
Fawn
.
  
<EOS>
"
Poor
dear
Lord
Fawn
!
"
said
Lady
Glencora
Palliser
to
her
dear
friend
Madame
Max
Goesler
;
"
do
you
remember
how
violently
he
was
in
love
with
Violet
Effingham
two
years
ago
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Two
years
is
a
long
time
,
Lady
Glencora
;
and
Violet
Effingham
has
chosen
another
husband
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
is
n't
this
a
fall
for
him
?
<EOS>
Violet
was
the
sweetest
girl
out
,
and
at
one
time
I
really
thought
she
meant
to
take
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
thought
she
meant
to
take
another
man
whom
she
did
not
take
,
"
said
Madame
Goesler
,
who
had
her
own
recollections
,
who
was
a
widow
herself
,
and
who
,
at
the
period
to
which
Lady
Glencora
was
referring
,
had
thought
that
perhaps
she
might
cease
to
be
a
widow
.
<EOS>
Not
that
she
had
ever
suggested
to
herself
that
Lord
Fawn
might
be
her
second
husband
.
  
<EOS>
"
Poor
Lord
Fawn
!
"
<EOS>
continued
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
he
is
terribly
in
want
of
money
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
surely
Lady
Eustace
is
very
pretty
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
 
she
is
very
pretty
;
nay
more
,
she
is
quite
lovely
to
look
at
.
<EOS>
And
she
is
clever
,
 
very
.
<EOS>
And
she
is
rich
,
 
very
.
<EOS>
But
 
"
  
"
Well
,
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
What
does
your
"
but
"
mean
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Who
ever
explains
a
"
but
'
?
<EOS>
You
're
a
great
deal
too
clever
,
Madame
Goesler
,
to
want
any
explanation
.
<EOS>
And
I
could
n't
explain
it
.
<EOS>
I
can
only
say
I
'm
sorry
for
poor
Lord
Fawn
,
 
who
is
a
gentleman
,
but
will
never
set
the
Thames
on
fire
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
All
the
same
,
I
like
Lord
Fawn
extremely
,
"
said
Madame
Goesler
,
"
<EOS>
and
I
think
he
's
just
the
man
to
marry
Lady
Eustace
.
<EOS>
He
's
always
at
his
office
or
at
the
House
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
A
man
may
be
a
great
deal
at
his
office
,
and
a
great
deal
more
at
the
House
than
Lord
Fawn
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
laughing
,
"
and
yet
think
about
his
wife
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
For
of
all
men
known
,
no
man
spent
more
hours
at
the
House
or
in
his
office
than
did
Lady
Glencora
's
husband
,
Mr.
Palliser
,
who
at
this
time
,
and
had
now
for
more
than
two
years
,
filled
the
high
place
of
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
.
  
<EOS>
This
conversation
took
place
in
Madame
Goesler
's
little
drawing
-
room
in
Park
Lane
;
but
,
three
days
after
this
,
the
same
two
ladies
met
again
at
the
house
then
occupied
by
Lady
Chiltern
in
Portman
Square
,
 
Lady
Chiltern
,
with
whom
,
as
Violet
Effingham
,
poor
Lord
Fawn
had
been
much
in
love
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
is
the
nicest
match
in
the
world
for
him
,
"
Lady
Chiltern
had
said
to
Madame
Goesler
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
have
you
heard
of
the
diamonds
?
"
asked
Lady
Glencora
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
diamonds
?
"
<EOS>
"
Whose
diamonds
?
"
<EOS>
Neither
of
the
others
had
heard
of
the
diamonds
,
and
Lady
Glencora
was
able
to
tell
her
story
.
<EOS>
Lady
Eustace
had
found
all
the
family
jewels
belonging
to
the
Eustace
family
in
the
strong
plate
room
at
Portray
Castle
,
and
had
taken
possession
of
them
as
property
found
in
her
own
house
.
<EOS>
John
Eustace
and
the
bishop
had
combined
in
demanding
them
on
behalf
of
the
heir
,
and
a
lawsuit
had
then
commenced
!
<EOS>
The
diamonds
were
the
most
costly
belonging
to
any
Commoner
in
England
,
and
had
been
valued
at
twenty
-
four
thousand
pounds
!
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
had
retreated
from
his
engagement
the
moment
he
heard
that
any
doubt
was
thrown
on
Lady
Eustace
's
right
to
their
possession
!
<EOS>
Lady
Eustace
had
declared
her
intention
of
bringing
an
action
against
Lord
Fawn
,
 
and
had
also
secreted
the
diamonds
!
<EOS>
The
reader
will
be
aware
that
this
statement
was
by
no
means
an
accurate
history
of
the
difficulty
as
far
as
it
had
as
yet
progressed
.
<EOS>
It
was
,
indeed
,
absolutely
false
in
every
detail
;
but
it
sufficed
to
show
that
the
matter
was
becoming
public
.
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
mean
to
say
that
Lord
Fawn
is
off
?
"
asked
Madame
Goesler
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
.
  
<EOS>
"
Poor
Lord
Fawn
!
"
exclaimed
Lady
Chiltern
.
<EOS>
"
It
really
seems
as
though
he
never
would
be
settled
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
he
has
courage
enough
for
such
conduct
as
that
,
"
said
Madame
Goesler
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
besides
,
Lady
Eustace
's
income
is
quite
certain
,
"
said
Lady
Chiltern
,
"
and
poor
dear
Lord
Fawn
does
want
money
so
badly
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
But
it
is
very
disagreeable
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
,
"
to
believe
that
your
wife
has
got
the
finest
diamonds
in
England
,
and
then
to
find
that
she
has
only
 
stolen
them
.
<EOS>
I
think
Lord
Fawn
is
right
.
<EOS>
If
a
man
does
marry
for
money
he
should
have
the
money
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
she
ever
took
him
.
<EOS>
There
is
no
doubt
about
her
beauty
,
and
she
might
have
done
better
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wo
n't
hear
Lord
Fawn
be
-
littled
,
"
said
Lady
Chiltern
.
  
<EOS>
"
Done
better
!
"
said
Madame
Goesler
.
<EOS>
"
How
could
she
have
done
better
?
<EOS>
He
is
a
peer
,
and
her
son
would
be
a
peer
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
think
she
could
have
done
better
.
"
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
in
her
time
had
wished
to
marry
a
man
who
had
sought
her
for
her
money
.
<EOS>
Lady
Chiltern
in
her
time
had
refused
to
be
Lady
Fawn
.
<EOS>
Madame
Goesler
in
her
time
had
declined
to
marry
an
English
peer
.
<EOS>
There
was
,
therefore
,
something
more
of
interest
in
the
conversation
to
each
of
them
than
was
quite
expressed
in
the
words
spoken
.
"
<EOS>
Is
she
to
be
at
your
party
on
Friday
,
Lady
Glencora
?
"
asked
Madame
Goesler
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
has
said
she
would
come
,
 
and
so
has
Lord
Fawn
;
for
that
matter
,
Lord
Fawn
dines
with
us
.
<EOS>
She
'll
find
that
out
,
and
then
she
'll
stay
away
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
she
,
"
said
Lady
Chiltern
.
<EOS>
"
She
'll
come
for
the
sake
of
the
bravado
.
<EOS>
She
's
not
the
woman
to
show
the
white
feather
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
he
's
ill
-
using
her
she
's
quite
right
,
"
said
Madame
Goesler
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
wear
the
very
diamonds
in
dispute
,
"
said
Lady
Chiltern
.
<EOS>
It
was
thus
that
the
matter
was
discussed
among
ladies
in
the
town
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
Fawn
's
marriage
going
on
?
"
<EOS>
This
question
was
asked
of
Mr.
Legge
Wilson
by
Barrington
Erle
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Legge
Wilson
was
the
Secretary
of
State
for
India
,
and
Barrington
Erle
was
in
the
Government
.
  
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
word
I
do
n't
know
,
"
said
Mr.
Wilson
.
<EOS>
"
The
work
goes
on
at
the
office
;
 
that
's
all
I
know
about
Fawn
.
<EOS>
He
has
n't
told
me
of
his
marriage
,
and
therefore
I
have
n't
spoken
to
him
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
has
n't
made
it
official
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
papers
have
n't
come
before
me
yet
,
"
said
Mr.
Wilson
.
  
<EOS>
"
When
they
do
they
'll
be
very
awkward
papers
,
as
far
as
I
hear
,
"
said
Barrington
Erle
.
<EOS>
"
There
is
no
doubt
they
were
engaged
,
and
I
believe
there
is
no
doubt
that
he
has
declared
off
,
and
refused
to
give
any
reason
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
the
money
is
not
all
there
,
"
suggested
Mr.
Wilson
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
a
queer
story
going
about
as
to
some
diamonds
.
<EOS>
No
one
knows
whom
they
belong
to
,
and
they
say
that
Fawn
has
accused
her
of
stealing
them
.
<EOS>
He
wants
to
get
hold
of
them
,
and
she
wo
n't
give
them
up
.
<EOS>
I
believe
the
lawyers
are
to
have
a
shy
at
it
.
<EOS>
I
'm
sorry
for
Fawn
.
<EOS>
It
'll
do
him
a
deal
of
mischief
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
'll
find
he
wo
n't
come
out
much
amiss
,
"
said
Mr.
Legge
Wilson
.
<EOS>
"
He
's
as
cautious
a
man
as
there
is
in
London
.
<EOS>
If
there
is
anything
wrong
 
"
  
"
There
is
a
great
deal
wrong
,
"
said
Barrington
Erle
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
'll
find
it
will
be
on
her
side
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
'll
find
also
that
she
'll
contrive
that
all
the
blame
shall
lie
upon
him
.
<EOS>
She
's
clever
enough
for
anything
!
<EOS>
Who
's
to
be
the
new
bishop
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
heard
Gresham
say
as
yet
;
Jones
,
I
should
think
,
"
said
Mr.
Wilson
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
who
is
Jones
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
clergyman
,
I
suppose
,
 
of
the
safe
sort
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
that
anything
else
is
necessary
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
From
which
it
will
be
seen
that
Mr.
Wilson
had
his
own
opinion
about
church
matters
,
and
also
that
people
very
high
up
in
the
world
were
concerning
themselves
about
poor
Lizzie
's
affairs
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Eustace
did
go
to
Lady
Glencora
's
evening
party
,
in
spite
of
Mr.
Camperdown
and
all
her
difficulties
.
<EOS>
Lady
Chiltern
had
been
quite
right
in
saying
that
Lizzie
was
not
the
woman
to
show
the
white
feather
.
<EOS>
She
went
,
knowing
that
she
would
meet
Lord
Fawn
,
and
she
did
wear
the
diamonds
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
first
time
that
they
had
been
round
her
neck
since
the
occasion
in
respect
to
which
Sir
Florian
had
placed
them
in
her
hands
,
and
it
had
not
been
without
much
screwing
up
of
her
courage
that
she
had
resolved
to
appear
on
this
occasion
with
the
much
-
talked
-
of
ornament
upon
her
person
.
<EOS>
It
was
now
something
over
a
fortnight
since
she
had
parted
with
Lord
Fawn
at
Fawn
Court
;
and
,
although
they
were
still
presumed
to
be
engaged
to
marry
each
other
,
and
were
both
living
in
London
,
she
had
not
seen
him
since
.
<EOS>
A
sort
of
message
had
reached
her
,
through
Frank
Greystock
,
to
the
effect
that
Lord
Fawn
thought
it
as
well
that
they
should
not
meet
till
the
matter
was
settled
.
<EOS>
Stipulations
had
been
made
by
Frank
on
her
behalf
,
and
this
had
been
inserted
among
them
.
<EOS>
She
had
received
the
message
with
scorn
,
 
with
a
mixture
of
scorn
and
gratitude
,
 
of
scorn
in
regard
to
the
man
who
had
promised
to
marry
her
,
and
of
affectionate
gratitude
to
the
cousin
who
had
made
the
arrangement
.
<EOS>
"
Of
course
I
shall
not
wish
to
see
him
while
he
chooses
to
entertain
such
an
idea
,
"
she
had
said
,
"
but
I
shall
not
keep
out
of
his
way
.
<EOS>
You
would
not
wish
me
to
keep
out
of
his
way
,
Frank
?
<EOS>
"
When
she
received
a
card
for
Lady
Glencora
's
party
,
very
soon
after
this
,
she
was
careful
to
answer
it
in
such
a
manner
as
to
impress
Lady
Glencora
with
a
remembrance
of
her
assent
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
would
probably
be
there
,
 
unless
he
remained
away
in
order
to
avoid
her
.
<EOS>
Then
she
had
ten
days
in
which
to
make
up
her
mind
as
to
wearing
the
diamonds
.
<EOS>
Her
courage
was
good
;
but
then
her
ignorance
was
so
great
!
<EOS>
She
did
not
know
whether
Mr.
Camperdown
might
not
contrive
to
have
them
taken
by
violence
from
her
neck
,
even
on
Lady
Glencora
's
stairs
.
<EOS>
Her
best
security
,
 
<EOS>
so
she
thought
,
 
would
be
in
the
fact
that
Mr.
Camperdown
would
not
know
of
her
purpose
.
<EOS>
She
told
no
one
,
 
not
even
Miss
Macnulty
;
but
she
appeared
before
that
lady
,
arrayed
in
all
her
glory
,
just
as
she
was
about
to
descend
to
her
carriage
.
<EOS>
"
You
've
got
the
necklace
on
!
"
said
Miss
Macnulty
.
<EOS>
"
Why
should
I
not
wear
my
own
necklace
?
<EOS>
"
she
asked
,
with
assumed
anger
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
's
rooms
were
already
very
full
when
Lizzie
entered
them
,
but
she
was
without
a
gentleman
,
and
room
was
made
for
her
to
pass
quickly
up
the
stairs
.
<EOS>
The
diamonds
had
been
recognised
by
many
before
she
had
reached
the
drawing
-
room
;
 
not
that
these
very
diamonds
were
known
,
or
that
there
was
a
special
memory
for
that
necklace
;
 
but
the
subject
had
been
so
generally
discussed
,
that
the
blaze
of
the
stones
immediately
brought
it
to
the
minds
of
men
and
women
.
<EOS>
"
There
she
is
,
with
poor
Eustace
's
twenty
thousand
pounds
round
her
neck
,
"
said
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
to
his
friend
Barrington
Erle
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
there
is
Lord
Fawn
going
to
look
after
them
,
"
replied
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
thought
it
right
,
at
any
rate
,
to
look
after
his
bride
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
had
whispered
into
his
ear
before
they
went
down
to
dinner
that
Lady
Eustace
would
be
there
in
the
evening
,
so
that
he
might
have
the
option
of
escaping
or
remaining
.
<EOS>
Could
he
have
escaped
without
any
one
knowing
that
he
had
escaped
,
he
would
not
have
gone
up
-
stairs
after
dinner
;
but
he
knew
that
he
was
observed
;
he
knew
that
people
were
talking
about
him
;
and
he
did
not
like
it
to
be
said
that
he
had
run
away
.
<EOS>
He
went
up
,
thinking
much
of
it
all
,
and
as
soon
as
he
saw
Lady
Eustace
he
made
his
way
to
her
and
accosted
her
.
<EOS>
Many
eyes
were
upon
them
,
but
no
ear
probably
heard
how
infinitely
unimportant
were
the
words
which
they
spoke
to
each
other
.
<EOS>
Her
manner
was
excellent
.
<EOS>
She
smiled
and
gave
him
her
hand
,
 
just
her
hand
without
the
slightest
pressure
,
 
and
spoke
a
half
-
whispered
word
,
looking
into
his
face
,
but
betraying
nothing
by
her
look
.
<EOS>
Then
he
asked
her
whether
she
would
dance
.
<EOS>
Yes
;
 
she
would
stand
up
for
a
quadrille
;
and
they
did
stand
up
for
a
quadrille
.
<EOS>
As
she
danced
with
no
one
else
,
it
was
clear
that
she
treated
Lord
Fawn
as
her
lover
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
the
dance
was
done
she
took
his
arm
and
moved
for
a
few
minutes
about
the
room
with
him
.
<EOS>
She
was
very
conscious
of
the
diamonds
,
but
she
did
not
show
the
feeling
in
her
face
.
<EOS>
He
also
was
conscious
of
them
,
and
he
did
show
it
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
recognise
the
necklace
,
but
he
knew
well
that
this
was
the
very
bone
of
contention
.
<EOS>
They
were
very
beautiful
,
and
seemed
to
him
to
outshine
all
other
jewellery
in
the
room
.
<EOS>
And
Lady
Eustace
was
a
woman
of
whom
it
might
almost
be
said
that
she
ought
to
wear
diamonds
.
<EOS>
She
was
made
to
sparkle
,
to
be
bright
with
outside
garniture
,
 
to
shine
and
glitter
,
and
be
rich
in
apparel
.
<EOS>
The
only
doubt
might
be
whether
paste
diamonds
might
not
better
suit
her
character
.
<EOS>
But
these
were
not
paste
,
and
she
did
shine
and
glitter
and
was
very
rich
.
<EOS>
It
must
not
be
brought
as
an
accusation
against
Lady
Glencora
's
guests
that
they
pressed
round
to
look
at
the
necklace
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
's
guests
knew
better
than
to
do
that
.
<EOS>
But
there
was
some
slight
ferment
,
 
slight
,
but
still
felt
both
by
Lord
Fawn
and
by
Lady
Eustace
.
<EOS>
Eyes
were
turned
upon
the
diamonds
,
and
there
were
whispers
here
and
there
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
bore
it
very
well
;
but
Lord
Fawn
was
uncomfortable
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
like
her
for
wearing
them
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
to
Lady
Chiltern
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
 
if
she
means
to
keep
them
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
pretend
,
however
,
to
know
anything
about
it
.
<EOS>
You
see
the
match
is
n't
off
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
not
.
<EOS>
What
do
you
think
I
did
?
<EOS>
He
dined
here
,
you
know
,
and
,
before
going
down
-
stairs
,
I
told
him
that
she
was
coming
.
<EOS>
I
thought
it
only
fair
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
did
he
say
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
took
care
that
he
should
n't
have
to
say
anything
;
but
,
to
tell
the
truth
,
I
did
n't
expect
him
to
come
up
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
ca
n't
be
any
quarrel
at
all
,
"
said
Lady
Chiltern
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
not
sure
of
that
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
"
They
are
not
so
very
loving
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lady
Eustace
made
the
most
of
her
opportunity
.
<EOS>
Soon
after
the
quadrille
was
over
she
asked
Lord
Fawn
to
get
her
carriage
for
her
.
<EOS>
Of
course
he
got
it
,
and
of
course
he
put
her
into
it
,
passing
up
and
down
-
stairs
twice
in
his
efforts
on
her
behalf
.
<EOS>
And
of
course
all
the
world
saw
what
he
was
doing
.
<EOS>
Up
to
the
last
moment
not
a
word
had
been
spoken
between
them
that
might
not
have
passed
between
the
most
ordinary
acquaintance
,
but
,
as
she
took
her
seat
,
she
put
her
face
forward
and
did
say
a
word
.
<EOS>
"
You
had
better
come
to
me
soon
,
"
she
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
,
"
said
Lord
Fawn
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
you
had
better
come
soon
.
<EOS>
All
this
is
wearing
me
,
 
perhaps
more
than
you
think
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
will
come
soon
,
"
said
Lord
Fawn
,
and
then
he
returned
among
Lady
Glencora
's
guests
,
very
uncomfortable
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
got
home
in
safety
and
locked
up
her
diamonds
in
the
iron
box
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
I
Have
Nothing
to
Give
"
 
<EOS>
It
was
now
the
end
of
June
,
and
Frank
Greystock
had
been
as
yet
but
once
at
Fawn
Court
since
he
had
written
to
Lucy
Morris
asking
her
to
be
his
wife
.
<EOS>
That
was
three
weeks
since
,
and
as
the
barrier
against
him
at
Fawn
Court
had
been
removed
by
Lady
Fawn
herself
,
the
Fawn
girls
thought
that
as
a
lover
he
was
very
slack
;
but
Lucy
was
not
in
the
least
annoyed
.
<EOS>
Lucy
knew
that
it
was
all
right
;
for
Frank
,
as
he
took
his
last
walk
round
the
shrubbery
with
her
during
that
visit
,
had
given
her
to
understand
that
there
was
a
little
difference
between
him
and
Lady
Fawn
in
regard
to
Lizzie
Eustace
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
her
only
relative
in
London
,
"
Frank
had
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
Lady
Linlithgow
,
"
suggested
Lucy
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
have
quarrelled
,
and
the
old
woman
is
as
bitter
as
gall
.
<EOS>
There
is
no
one
else
to
stand
up
for
her
,
and
I
must
see
that
she
is
n't
ill
-
used
.
<EOS>
Women
do
hate
each
other
so
virulently
,
and
Lady
Fawn
hates
her
future
daughter
-
in
-
law
.
<EOS>
"
Lucy
did
not
in
the
least
grudge
her
lover
's
assistance
to
his
cousin
.
<EOS>
There
was
nothing
of
jealousy
in
her
feeling
.
<EOS>
She
thought
that
Lizzie
was
unworthy
of
Frank
's
goodness
,
but
on
such
an
occasion
as
this
she
would
not
say
so
.
<EOS>
She
told
him
nothing
of
the
bribe
that
had
been
offered
her
,
nor
on
that
subject
had
she
said
a
word
to
any
of
the
Fawns
.
<EOS>
She
understood
,
too
,
that
as
Frank
had
declared
his
purpose
of
supporting
Lizzie
,
it
might
be
as
well
that
he
should
see
just
at
present
as
little
of
Lady
Fawn
as
possible
.
<EOS>
Not
a
word
,
however
,
had
Lady
Fawn
said
to
Lucy
disparaging
her
lover
for
his
conduct
.
<EOS>
It
was
quite
understood
now
at
Fawn
Court
,
by
all
the
girls
,
and
no
doubt
by
the
whole
establishment
,
that
Lizzie
Eustace
was
to
be
regarded
as
an
enemy
.
<EOS>
It
was
believed
by
them
all
that
Lord
Fawn
had
broken
off
the
match
 
<EOS>
or
,
at
least
,
that
he
was
resolved
to
break
it
;
but
various
stratagems
were
to
be
used
,
and
terrible
engines
of
war
were
to
be
brought
up
,
if
necessary
,
to
prevent
an
alliance
which
was
now
thought
to
be
disreputable
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Hittaway
had
been
hard
at
work
,
and
had
found
out
something
very
like
truth
in
regard
to
the
whole
transaction
with
Mr.
Benjamin
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
Mrs.
Hittaway
had
found
out
more
than
was
quite
true
as
to
poor
Lizzie
's
former
sins
;
but
what
she
did
find
out
she
used
with
all
her
skill
,
communicating
her
facts
to
her
mother
,
to
Mr.
Camperdown
,
and
to
her
brother
.
<EOS>
Her
brother
had
almost
quarrelled
with
her
,
but
still
she
continued
to
communicate
her
facts
.
  
<EOS>
At
this
period
Frank
Greystock
was
certainly
somewhat
unreasonable
in
regard
to
his
cousin
.
<EOS>
At
one
time
,
as
the
reader
will
remember
,
he
had
thought
of
asking
her
to
be
his
wife
;
 
because
she
was
rich
;
but
even
then
he
had
not
thought
well
of
her
,
had
hardly
believed
her
to
be
honest
,
and
had
rejoiced
when
he
found
that
circumstances
rather
than
his
own
judgment
had
rescued
him
from
that
evil
.
<EOS>
He
had
professed
to
be
delighted
when
Lord
Fawn
was
accepted
,
 
as
being
happy
to
think
that
his
somewhat
dangerous
cousin
was
provided
with
so
safe
a
husband
;
and
,
when
he
had
first
heard
of
the
necklace
,
he
had
expressed
an
opinion
that
of
course
it
would
be
given
up
.
<EOS>
In
all
this
then
he
had
shown
no
strong
loyalty
to
his
cousin
,
no
very
dear
friendship
,
nothing
to
make
those
who
knew
him
feel
that
he
would
buckle
on
armour
in
her
cause
.
<EOS>
But
of
late
,
 
and
that
,
too
,
since
his
engagement
with
Lucy
,
 
he
had
stood
up
very
stoutly
as
her
friend
,
and
the
armour
was
being
buckled
on
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
scrupled
to
say
that
he
meant
to
see
her
through
this
business
with
Lord
Fawn
,
and
had
somewhat
astonished
Mr.
Camperdown
by
raising
a
doubt
on
the
question
of
the
necklace
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
ca
n't
but
know
that
she
has
no
more
right
to
it
than
I
have
,
"
Mr.
Camperdown
had
said
to
his
son
with
indignation
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Camperdown
was
becoming
unhappy
about
the
necklace
,
not
quite
knowing
how
to
proceed
in
the
matter
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
Frank
had
obeyed
his
better
instincts
,
and
had
asked
Lucy
Morris
to
be
his
wife
.
<EOS>
He
had
gone
to
Fawn
Court
in
compliance
with
a
promise
to
Lizzie
Eustace
,
that
he
would
call
upon
her
there
.
<EOS>
He
had
walked
with
Lucy
because
he
was
at
Fawn
Court
.
<EOS>
And
he
had
written
to
Lucy
because
of
the
words
he
had
spoken
during
the
walk
.
<EOS>
In
all
this
the
matter
had
arranged
itself
as
such
matters
do
,
and
there
was
nothing
,
in
truth
,
to
be
regretted
.
<EOS>
He
really
did
love
the
girl
with
all
his
heart
.
<EOS>
It
may
,
perhaps
,
be
said
that
he
had
never
in
truth
loved
any
other
woman
.
<EOS>
In
the
best
humours
of
his
mind
he
would
tell
himself
,
 
had
from
old
times
told
himself
often
,
 
that
unless
he
married
Lucy
Morris
he
could
never
marry
at
all
.
<EOS>
When
his
mother
,
knowing
that
poor
Lucy
was
penniless
,
had
,
as
mothers
will
do
,
begged
him
to
beware
,
he
had
spoken
up
for
his
love
honestly
,
declaring
to
her
that
in
his
eyes
there
was
no
woman
living
equal
to
Lucy
Morris
.
<EOS>
The
reader
has
seen
him
with
the
words
almost
on
his
tongue
with
which
to
offer
his
hand
to
his
cousin
,
Lizzie
Eustace
,
knowing
as
he
did
so
that
his
heart
had
been
given
to
Lucy
,
 
knowing
also
that
Lucy
's
heart
had
been
given
to
him
!
<EOS>
But
he
had
not
done
it
,
and
the
better
humour
had
prevailed
.
  
<EOS>
Within
the
figure
and
frame
and
clothes
and
cuticle
,
within
the
bones
and
flesh
of
many
of
us
,
there
is
but
one
person
,
 
a
man
or
woman
,
with
a
preponderance
either
of
good
or
evil
,
whose
conduct
in
any
emergency
may
be
predicted
with
some
assurance
of
accuracy
by
any
one
knowing
the
man
or
woman
.
<EOS>
Such
persons
are
simple
,
single
,
and
,
perhaps
,
generally
,
safe
.
<EOS>
They
walk
along
lines
in
accordance
with
certain
fixed
instincts
or
principles
,
and
are
to
-
day
as
they
were
yesterday
,
and
will
be
to
-
morrow
as
they
are
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
Lady
Eustace
was
such
a
person
,
and
so
was
Lucy
Morris
.
<EOS>
Opposite
in
their
characters
as
the
two
poles
,
they
were
,
each
of
them
,
a
simple
entity
;
and
any
doubt
or
error
in
judging
of
the
future
conduct
of
either
of
them
would
come
from
insufficient
knowledge
of
the
woman
.
<EOS>
But
there
are
human
beings
who
,
though
of
necessity
single
in
body
,
are
dual
in
character
;
 
in
whose
breasts
not
only
is
evil
always
fighting
against
good
,
 
but
to
whom
evil
is
sometimes
horribly
,
hideously
evil
,
but
is
sometimes
also
not
hideous
at
all
.
<EOS>
Of
such
men
it
may
be
said
that
Satan
obtains
an
intermittent
grasp
,
from
which
,
when
it
is
released
,
the
rebound
carries
them
high
amidst
virtuous
resolutions
and
a
thorough
love
of
things
good
and
noble
.
<EOS>
Such
men
,
 
or
women
,
 
may
hardly
,
perhaps
,
debase
themselves
with
the
more
vulgar
vices
.
<EOS>
They
will
not
be
rogues
,
or
thieves
,
or
drunkards
,
 
or
,
perhaps
,
liars
;
but
ambition
,
luxury
,
self
-
indulgence
,
pride
,
and
covetousness
will
get
a
hold
of
them
,
and
in
various
moods
will
be
to
them
virtues
in
lieu
of
vices
.
<EOS>
Such
a
man
was
Frank
Greystock
,
who
could
walk
along
the
banks
of
the
quiet
,
trout
-
giving
Bob
,
at
Bobsborough
,
whipping
the
river
with
his
rod
,
telling
himself
that
the
world
lost
for
love
would
be
a
bad
thing
well
lost
for
a
fine
purpose
;
and
who
could
also
stand
,
with
his
hands
in
his
trousers
pockets
,
looking
down
upon
the
pavement
,
in
the
purlieus
of
the
courts
at
Westminster
,
and
swear
to
himself
that
he
would
win
the
game
,
let
the
cost
to
his
heart
be
what
it
might
.
<EOS>
What
must
a
man
be
who
would
allow
some
undefined
feeling
,
 
some
inward
ache
which
he
calls
a
passion
and
can
not
analyse
,
some
desire
which
has
come
of
instinct
and
not
of
judgment
,
 
to
interfere
with
all
the
projects
of
his
intellect
,
with
all
the
work
which
he
has
laid
out
for
his
accomplishment
?
<EOS>
Circumstances
had
thrown
him
into
a
path
of
life
for
which
,
indeed
,
his
means
were
insufficient
,
but
which
he
regarded
as
,
of
all
paths
,
the
noblest
and
the
manliest
.
<EOS>
If
he
could
be
true
to
himself
,
 
with
such
truth
as
at
these
moments
would
seem
to
him
to
be
the
truest
truth
,
 
there
was
nothing
in
rank
,
nothing
in
ambition
,
which
might
not
be
within
his
reach
.
<EOS>
He
might
live
with
the
highest
,
the
best
-
educated
,
and
the
most
beautiful
;
he
might
assist
in
directing
national
councils
by
his
intelligence
;
and
might
make
a
name
for
himself
which
should
be
remembered
in
his
country
,
and
of
which
men
would
read
the
records
in
the
histories
written
in
after
ages
.
<EOS>
But
to
do
this
,
he
must
walk
warily
.
<EOS>
He
,
an
embarrassed
man
,
a
man
already
in
debt
,
a
man
with
no
realised
property
coming
to
him
in
reversion
,
was
called
upon
to
live
,
and
to
live
as
though
at
his
ease
,
among
those
who
had
been
born
to
wealth
.
<EOS>
And
,
indeed
,
he
had
so
cleverly
learned
the
ways
of
the
wealthy
,
that
he
hardly
knew
any
longer
how
to
live
at
his
ease
among
the
poor
.
  
<EOS>
But
had
he
walked
warily
when
he
went
down
to
Richmond
,
and
afterwards
,
sitting
alone
in
the
obscurity
of
his
chamber
,
wrote
the
letter
which
had
made
Lucy
Morris
so
happy
?
<EOS>
It
must
be
acknowledged
that
he
did
,
in
truth
,
love
the
girl
,
 
that
he
was
capable
of
a
strong
feeling
.
<EOS>
She
was
not
beautiful
,
 
hardly
even
pretty
,
small
,
in
appearance
almost
insignificant
,
quite
penniless
,
a
governess
!
<EOS>
He
had
often
asked
himself
what
it
was
that
had
so
vanquished
him
.
<EOS>
She
always
wore
a
pale
grey
frock
,
 
with
,
perhaps
,
a
grey
ribbon
,
 
never
running
into
any
bright
form
of
clothing
.
<EOS>
She
was
educated
,
very
well
-
educated
;
but
she
owned
no
great
accomplishment
.
<EOS>
She
had
not
sung
his
heart
away
,
or
ravished
him
with
the
harp
.
<EOS>
Even
of
her
words
she
was
sparing
,
seeming
to
care
more
to
listen
than
to
speak
;
a
humble
little
thing
to
look
at
,
 
one
of
whom
you
might
say
that
she
regarded
herself
as
well
-
placed
if
left
in
the
background
.
<EOS>
Yet
he
had
found
her
out
,
and
knew
her
.
<EOS>
He
had
recognised
the
treasure
,
and
had
greatly
desired
to
possess
it
.
<EOS>
He
had
confessed
to
himself
that
,
could
splendour
and
ambition
be
laid
aside
,
that
little
thing
would
be
all
the
world
to
him
.
<EOS>
As
he
sat
in
court
,
or
in
the
House
,
patient
from
practice
as
he
half
-
listened
to
the
ponderous
speeches
of
advocates
or
politicians
,
he
would
think
of
the
sparkle
in
her
eye
,
of
the
dimple
in
her
chin
,
of
the
lines
of
the
mouth
which
could
plead
so
eloquently
,
though
with
few
words
.
<EOS>
To
sit
on
some
high
seat
among
his
countrymen
,
and
also
to
marry
Lucy
Morris
,
 
that
would
be
a
high
ambition
.
<EOS>
He
had
chosen
his
way
now
,
and
she
was
engaged
to
be
his
wife
.
  
<EOS>
As
he
thought
of
it
after
he
had
done
it
,
it
was
not
all
happiness
,
all
contentment
,
with
him
.
<EOS>
He
did
feel
that
he
had
crippled
himself
,
 
impeded
himself
in
running
the
race
,
as
it
were
,
with
a
log
round
his
leg
.
<EOS>
He
had
offered
to
marry
her
,
and
he
must
do
so
at
once
,
or
almost
at
once
,
because
she
could
now
find
no
other
home
<EOS>
but
his
.
<EOS>
He
knew
,
as
well
as
did
Lady
Fawn
,
that
she
could
not
go
into
another
family
as
governess
;
and
he
knew
also
that
she
ought
not
to
remain
in
Lady
Fawn
's
house
an
hour
longer
than
she
would
be
wanted
there
.
<EOS>
He
must
alter
his
plan
of
living
at
once
,
give
up
the
luxury
of
his
rooms
at
the
Grosvenor
,
take
a
small
house
somewhere
,
probably
near
the
Swiss
Cottage
,
come
up
and
down
to
his
chambers
by
the
underground
railway
,
and
,
in
all
probability
,
abandon
Parliament
altogether
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
sure
whether
,
in
good
faith
,
he
should
not
at
once
give
notice
of
his
intended
acceptance
of
the
Chiltern
Hundreds
to
the
electors
of
Bobsborough
.
<EOS>
Thus
meditating
,
under
the
influence
of
that
intermittent
evil
grasp
,
almost
angry
with
himself
for
the
open
truth
which
he
had
spoken
,
 
or
rather
written
,
and
perhaps
thinking
more
of
Lizzie
and
her
beauty
than
he
should
have
done
,
in
the
course
of
three
weeks
he
had
paid
but
one
visit
to
Fawn
Court
.
<EOS>
Then
,
of
a
sudden
,
finding
himself
one
afternoon
relieved
from
work
,
he
resolved
to
go
there
.
<EOS>
The
days
were
still
almost
at
their
longest
,
and
he
did
not
scruple
to
present
himself
before
Lady
Fawn
between
eight
and
nine
in
the
evening
.
<EOS>
They
were
all
at
tea
,
and
he
was
welcomed
kindly
.
<EOS>
Lucy
,
when
he
was
announced
,
at
once
got
up
and
met
him
almost
at
the
doorway
,
sparkling
with
just
a
tear
of
joy
in
her
eye
,
with
a
look
in
her
face
,
and
a
loving
manner
,
which
for
the
moment
made
him
sure
that
the
little
house
near
the
Swiss
Cottage
would
,
after
all
,
be
the
only
Elysium
upon
earth
.
<EOS>
If
she
spoke
a
word
he
hardly
heard
it
,
but
her
hand
was
in
his
,
so
cool
and
soft
,
almost
trembling
in
its
grasp
,
with
no
attempt
to
withdraw
itself
,
frank
,
loving
,
and
honest
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
perfect
satisfaction
in
her
greeting
which
at
once
told
him
that
she
had
no
discontented
thoughts
,
 
had
had
no
such
thought
,
 
because
he
had
been
so
long
without
coming
.
<EOS>
To
see
him
was
a
great
joy
.
<EOS>
But
every
hour
of
her
life
was
a
joy
to
her
,
knowing
,
as
she
did
know
,
that
he
loved
her
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
was
gracious
,
the
girls
were
hospitable
,
and
he
found
himself
made
very
welcome
amidst
all
the
women
at
the
tea
-
table
.
<EOS>
Not
a
word
was
said
about
Lizzie
Eustace
.
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
talked
about
Parliament
,
and
professed
to
pity
a
poor
lover
who
was
so
bound
to
his
country
that
he
could
not
see
his
mistress
above
once
a
fortnight
.
"
<EOS>
But
there
'll
be
a
good
time
coming
next
month
,
"
she
said
;
 
for
it
was
now
July
.
"
<EOS>
Though
the
girls
ca
n't
make
their
claims
felt
,
the
grouse
can
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
n't
the
House
altogether
that
rules
me
with
a
rod
of
iron
,
Lady
Fawn
,
"
said
Frank
,
"
but
the
necessity
of
earning
daily
bread
by
the
sweat
of
my
brow
.
<EOS>
A
man
who
has
to
sit
in
court
all
day
must
take
the
night
,
 
or
,
indeed
,
any
time
that
he
can
get
,
 
to
read
up
his
cases
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
the
grouse
put
a
stop
to
all
work
,
"
said
Lady
Fawn
.
<EOS>
"
My
gardener
told
me
just
now
that
he
wanted
a
day
or
two
in
August
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
doubt
but
that
he
is
going
to
the
moors
.
<EOS>
Are
you
going
to
the
moors
,
Mr.
Greystock
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
As
it
happened
,
Frank
Greystock
did
not
quite
know
whether
he
was
going
to
the
moors
or
not
.
<EOS>
The
Ayrshire
grouse
-
shooting
is
not
the
best
in
Scotland
;
 
but
there
is
grouse
-
shooting
in
Ayrshire
;
and
the
shooting
on
the
Portray
mountains
is
not
the
worst
shooting
in
the
county
.
<EOS>
The
castle
at
Portray
overhangs
the
sea
,
but
there
is
a
wild
district
attached
to
it
stretching
far
back
inland
,
in
regard
to
which
Lizzie
Eustace
was
very
proud
of
talking
of
"
her
shooting
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Early
in
the
spring
of
the
present
year
she
had
asked
her
cousin
Frank
to
accept
the
shooting
for
the
coming
season
,
 
and
he
had
accepted
it
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
probably
be
abroad
,
"
she
said
,
"
but
there
is
the
old
castle
.
"
<EOS>
She
had
offered
it
as
though
he
had
been
her
brother
,
and
he
had
said
that
he
would
go
down
for
a
couple
of
weeks
,
 
not
to
the
castle
,
but
to
a
little
lodge
some
miles
up
from
the
sea
,
of
which
she
told
him
when
he
declined
the
castle
.
<EOS>
When
this
invitation
was
given
there
was
no
engagement
between
her
and
Lord
Fawn
.
<EOS>
Since
that
date
,
within
the
last
day
or
two
,
she
had
reminded
him
of
it
.
"
<EOS>
Wo
n't
his
lordship
be
there
?
"
<EOS>
he
had
said
laughingly
.
"
<EOS>
Certainly
not
,
"
she
had
answered
with
serious
earnestness
.
<EOS>
Then
she
had
explained
that
her
plan
of
going
abroad
had
been
set
aside
by
circumstances
.
<EOS>
She
did
mean
to
go
down
to
Portray
.
<EOS>
"
I
could
n't
have
you
at
the
castle
,
"
she
said
,
smiling
;
"
but
even
an
Othello
could
n't
object
to
a
first
cousin
at
a
little
cottage
ever
so
many
miles
off
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
n't
for
him
to
suggest
what
objections
might
rise
to
the
brain
of
a
modern
Othello
;
but
after
some
hesitation
he
said
that
he
would
be
there
.
<EOS>
He
had
promised
the
trip
to
a
friend
,
and
would
like
to
keep
his
promise
.
<EOS>
But
,
nevertheless
,
he
almost
thought
that
he
ought
to
avoid
Portray
.
<EOS>
He
intended
to
support
his
cousin
as
far
as
he
might
do
so
honestly
;
but
he
was
not
quite
minded
to
stand
by
her
through
good
report
and
evil
report
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
desire
to
be
specially
known
as
her
champion
,
and
yet
he
felt
that
that
position
would
be
almost
forced
upon
him
.
<EOS>
He
foresaw
danger
,
 
and
consequently
he
was
doubting
about
his
journey
to
Scotland
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hardly
know
whether
I
am
or
not
,
"
said
Frank
,
 
<EOS>
and
he
almost
felt
that
he
was
blushing
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
are
,
"
said
Lucy
.
<EOS>
"
When
a
man
has
to
work
all
day
and
nearly
all
night
he
should
go
where
he
may
get
fresh
air
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
very
good
air
without
going
to
Scotland
for
it
,
"
said
Lady
Fawn
,
who
kept
up
an
excellent
house
at
Richmond
,
but
who
,
with
all
her
daughters
,
could
not
afford
autumn
trips
.
<EOS>
The
Fawns
lived
at
Fawn
Court
all
the
year
round
,
and
consequently
Lady
Fawn
thought
that
air
was
to
be
found
in
England
sufficiently
good
for
all
purposes
of
vitality
and
recreation
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
not
quite
the
same
thing
,
"
said
Lucy
;
 
"
at
least
,
not
for
a
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
After
that
she
was
allowed
to
escape
into
the
grounds
with
her
lover
,
and
was
made
happy
with
half
-
an
-
hour
of
unalloyed
bliss
.
<EOS>
To
be
alone
with
the
girl
to
whom
he
is
not
engaged
is
a
man
's
delight
;
 
to
be
alone
with
the
man
to
whom
she
is
engaged
<EOS>
is
the
woman
's
.
<EOS>
When
the
thing
is
settled
there
is
always
present
to
the
man
something
of
a
feeling
of
clipped
wings
;
whereas
the
woman
is
conscious
of
a
new
power
of
expanding
her
pinions
.
<EOS>
The
certainty
of
the
thing
is
to
him
repressive
.
<EOS>
He
has
done
his
work
,
and
gained
his
victory
,
 
and
by
conquering
has
become
a
slave
.
<EOS>
To
her
the
certainty
of
the
thing
is
the
removal
of
a
restraint
which
has
hitherto
always
been
on
her
.
<EOS>
She
can
tell
him
everything
,
and
be
told
everything
,
 
whereas
her
previous
confidences
,
made
with
those
of
her
own
sex
,
have
been
tame
,
and
by
comparison
valueless
.
<EOS>
He
has
no
new
confidence
to
make
,
 
unless
when
he
comes
to
tell
her
he
likes
his
meat
well
done
,
and
wants
his
breakfast
to
be
punctual
.
<EOS>
Lucy
now
not
only
promised
herself
,
but
did
actually
realise
a
great
joy
.
<EOS>
He
seemed
to
her
all
that
her
heart
desired
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
man
whose
manner
was
naturally
caressing
and
demonstrative
,
and
she
was
to
him
,
of
all
women
,
the
sweetest
,
the
dearest
,
the
most
perfect
,
 
and
all
his
own
.
"
<EOS>
But
,
Frank
,
"
 
she
had
already
been
taught
to
call
him
Frank
when
they
were
alone
together
,
 
<EOS>
"
what
will
come
of
all
this
about
Lizzie
Eustace
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
will
be
married
,
 
of
course
.
"
  
"
Do
you
think
so
?
<EOS>
I
am
sure
Lady
Fawn
does
n't
think
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
Lady
Fawn
thinks
on
such
a
matter
can
not
be
helped
.
<EOS>
When
a
man
asks
a
woman
to
marry
him
,
and
she
accepts
,
the
natural
consequence
is
that
they
will
be
married
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
think
so
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
so
,
 
sometimes
,
"
said
Lucy
,
with
her
two
hands
joined
upon
his
arm
,
and
hanging
to
it
with
all
her
little
weight
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
really
do
hope
it
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
do
;
you
know
I
do
.
<EOS>
Hope
it
!
<EOS>
I
should
die
if
I
did
n't
hope
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
why
should
n't
she
?
"
<EOS>
He
asked
his
question
with
a
quick
,
sharp
voice
,
and
then
turned
upon
her
for
an
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
,
"
she
said
,
very
softly
,
and
still
clinging
to
him
.
<EOS>
"
I
sometimes
think
there
is
a
difference
in
people
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
a
difference
;
but
,
still
,
we
hardly
judge
of
people
sufficiently
by
our
own
feelings
.
<EOS>
As
she
accepted
him
,
you
may
be
sure
that
she
wishes
to
marry
him
.
<EOS>
She
has
more
to
give
than
he
has
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
have
nothing
to
give
,
"
she
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
thought
so
,
I
'd
go
back
even
now
,
"
he
answered
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
because
you
have
so
much
to
give
,
 
so
much
more
than
most
others
,
 
that
I
have
thought
of
you
,
dreamed
of
you
as
my
wife
,
almost
ever
since
I
first
knew
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
nothing
left
to
give
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
What
I
ever
had
is
all
given
.
<EOS>
People
call
it
the
heart
.
<EOS>
I
think
it
is
heart
,
and
brain
,
and
mind
,
and
body
,
 
and
almost
soul
.
<EOS>
But
,
Frank
,
though
Lizzie
Eustace
is
your
cousin
,
I
do
n't
want
to
be
likened
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
is
very
clever
,
and
beautiful
,
 
and
has
a
way
with
her
that
I
know
is
charming
;
 
but
 
"
  
"
But
what
,
Lucy
?
"
  
"
I
do
n't
think
she
cares
so
much
as
some
people
.
<EOS>
I
dare
say
she
likes
Lord
Fawn
very
well
,
but
I
do
not
believe
she
loves
him
as
I
love
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
're
engaged
,
"
said
Frank
,
"
and
the
best
thing
they
can
do
is
to
marry
each
other
.
<EOS>
I
can
tell
you
this
,
at
any
rate
,
"
 
and
his
manner
again
became
serious
,
 
"
<EOS>
if
Lord
Fawn
behaves
ill
to
her
,
I
,
as
her
cousin
,
shall
take
her
part
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
mean
that
you
'll
 
fight
him
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
my
darling
.
<EOS>
Men
do
n't
fight
each
other
now
-
a
-
days
;
 
not
often
,
at
least
,
and
Fawn
and
I
are
not
of
the
fighting
sort
.
<EOS>
I
can
make
him
understand
what
I
mean
and
what
others
will
mean
without
fighting
him
.
<EOS>
He
is
making
a
paltry
excuse
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
why
should
he
want
to
excuse
himself
 
without
reason
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Because
he
is
afraid
.
<EOS>
People
have
got
hold
of
him
and
told
him
lies
,
and
he
thinks
there
will
be
a
scrape
about
this
necklace
,
and
he
hates
a
scrape
.
<EOS>
He
'll
marry
her
at
last
,
without
a
doubt
,
and
Lady
Fawn
is
only
making
trouble
for
herself
by
trying
to
prevent
it
.
<EOS>
You
ca
n't
do
anything
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
no
;
 
I
ca
n't
do
anything
.
<EOS>
When
she
was
here
it
became
at
last
quite
disagreeable
.
<EOS>
She
hardly
spoke
to
them
,
and
I
'm
sure
that
even
the
servants
understood
that
there
was
a
quarrel
.
<EOS>
"
She
did
not
say
a
word
of
Lizzie
's
offer
of
the
brooch
to
herself
,
nor
of
the
stories
which
by
degrees
were
reaching
her
ears
as
to
the
old
debts
,
and
the
diamonds
,
and
the
young
bride
's
conduct
to
Lady
Linlithgow
as
soon
as
she
married
her
grand
husband
,
Sir
Florian
.
<EOS>
She
did
think
badly
of
Lizzie
,
and
could
not
but
regret
that
her
own
noble
,
generous
Frank
should
have
to
expend
his
time
and
labour
on
a
friend
unworthy
of
his
friendship
;
but
there
was
no
shade
of
jealousy
in
her
feeling
,
and
she
uttered
no
word
against
Lizzie
more
bitter
than
that
in
which
she
declared
that
there
was
a
difference
between
people
.
  
<EOS>
And
then
there
was
something
said
as
to
their
own
prospects
in
life
.
<EOS>
Lucy
at
once
and
with
vehemence
declared
that
she
did
not
look
for
or
expect
an
immediate
marriage
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
scruple
to
tell
him
that
she
knew
well
how
difficult
was
the
task
before
him
,
and
that
it
might
be
essential
for
his
interest
that
he
should
remain
as
he
was
for
a
year
or
two
.
<EOS>
He
was
astonished
to
find
how
completely
she
understood
his
position
,
and
how
thoroughly
she
sympathised
with
his
interests
.
<EOS>
"
There
is
only
one
thing
I
could
n't
do
for
you
,
"
she
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
is
the
one
thing
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
could
n't
give
you
up
.
<EOS>
I
almost
thought
that
I
ought
to
refuse
you
because
I
can
do
nothing
,
 
nothing
to
help
you
.
<EOS>
But
there
will
always
come
a
limit
to
self
-
denial
.
<EOS>
I
could
n't
do
that
!
<EOS>
Could
I
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
reader
will
know
how
this
question
was
answered
,
and
will
not
want
to
be
told
of
the
long
,
close
,
clinging
,
praiseworthy
kiss
with
which
the
young
barrister
assured
her
that
would
have
been
on
her
part
an
act
of
self
-
denial
which
would
to
him
have
been
absolutely
ruinous
.
<EOS>
It
was
agreed
,
however
,
between
them
,
that
Lady
Fawn
should
be
told
that
they
did
not
propose
to
marry
till
some
time
in
the
following
year
,
and
that
she
should
be
formally
asked
to
allow
Lucy
to
have
a
home
at
Fawn
Court
in
the
interval
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
My
Brother
"
 
Lord
Fawn
had
promised
,
as
he
put
Lizzie
into
her
carriage
,
that
he
would
come
to
her
soon
,
 
but
he
did
not
come
soon
.
<EOS>
A
fortnight
passed
and
he
did
not
show
himself
.
<EOS>
Nothing
further
had
been
done
in
the
matter
of
the
diamonds
,
except
that
Mr.
Camperdown
had
written
to
Frank
Greystock
,
explaining
how
impossible
it
was
that
the
question
of
their
possession
should
be
referred
to
arbitration
.
<EOS>
According
to
him
they
belonged
to
the
heir
,
as
did
the
estate
;
and
no
one
would
have
the
power
of
accepting
an
arbitration
respecting
them
,
 
an
arbitration
which
might
separate
them
from
the
estate
of
which
an
infant
was
the
owner
for
his
life
,
 
any
more
than
such
arbitration
could
be
accepted
as
to
the
property
of
the
estate
itself
.
<EOS>
"
Possession
is
nine
points
of
the
law
,
"
said
Frank
to
himself
,
as
he
put
the
letter
aside
,
 
thinking
at
the
same
time
that
possession
in
the
hands
of
Lizzie
Eustace
included
certainly
every
one
of
those
nine
points
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
wore
her
diamonds
again
and
then
again
.
<EOS>
There
may
be
a
question
whether
the
possession
of
the
necklace
and
the
publicity
of
their
history
,
 
which
,
however
,
like
many
other
histories
,
was
most
inaccurately
told
,
 
did
not
add
something
to
her
reputation
as
a
lady
of
fashion
.
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
,
Lord
Fawn
did
not
come
to
see
her
.
<EOS>
So
she
wrote
to
him
.
"
<EOS>
My
dear
Frederic
,
had
you
not
better
come
to
me
?
<EOS>
Yours
affectionately
,
 
L.
I
go
to
the
North
at
the
end
of
this
month
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
But
Frank
Greystock
did
visit
her
,
 
more
than
once
.
<EOS>
On
the
day
after
the
above
letter
was
written
he
came
to
her
.
<EOS>
It
was
on
Sunday
afternoon
,
when
July
was
more
than
half
over
,
and
he
found
her
alone
.
<EOS>
Miss
Macnulty
had
gone
to
church
,
and
Lizzie
was
lying
listlessly
on
a
sofa
with
a
volume
of
poetry
in
her
hand
.
<EOS>
She
had
in
truth
been
reading
the
book
,
and
in
her
way
enjoying
it
.
<EOS>
It
told
her
the
story
of
certain
knights
of
old
,
who
had
gone
forth
in
quest
of
a
sign
from
heaven
,
which
sign
,
if
verily
seen
by
them
,
might
be
taken
to
signify
that
they
themselves
were
esteemed
holy
,
and
fit
for
heavenly
joy
.
<EOS>
One
would
have
thought
that
no
theme
could
have
been
less
palatable
to
such
a
one
as
Lizzie
Eustace
;
but
the
melody
of
the
lines
had
pleased
her
ear
,
and
she
was
always
able
to
arouse
for
herself
a
false
enthusiasm
on
things
which
were
utterly
outside
herself
in
life
.
<EOS>
She
thought
she
too
could
have
travelled
in
search
of
that
holy
sign
,
and
have
borne
all
things
,
and
abandoned
all
things
,
and
have
persevered
,
 
and
of
a
certainty
have
been
rewarded
.
<EOS>
But
as
for
giving
up
a
string
of
diamonds
,
in
common
honesty
,
 
that
was
beyond
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
whether
men
ever
were
like
that
?
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
as
she
allowed
her
cousin
to
take
the
book
from
her
hands
.
  
<EOS>
"
Let
us
hope
not
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Frank
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
were
,
no
doubt
,
as
fanatic
and
foolish
as
you
please
.
<EOS>
If
you
will
read
to
the
end
 
"
  
"
I
have
read
it
all
,
 
every
word
of
it
,
"
said
Lizzie
,
enthusiastically
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
you
know
that
Arthur
did
not
go
on
the
search
,
because
he
had
a
job
of
work
to
do
,
by
the
doing
of
which
the
people
around
him
might
perhaps
be
somewhat
benefited
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
like
Launcelot
better
than
Arthur
,
"
said
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
did
the
Queen
,
"
replied
Frank
.
  
<EOS>
"
Your
useful
,
practical
man
,
who
attends
vestries
,
and
sits
at
Boards
,
and
measures
out
his
gifts
to
others
by
the
ounce
,
never
has
any
heart
.
<EOS>
Has
he
,
Frank
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
what
heart
means
.
<EOS>
I
sometimes
fancy
that
it
is
a
talent
for
getting
into
debt
,
and
running
away
with
other
men
's
wives
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
say
that
on
purpose
to
make
me
quarrel
with
you
.
<EOS>
You
do
n't
run
away
with
other
men
's
wives
,
and
you
have
heart
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
get
into
debt
,
unfortunately
;
and
as
for
other
men
's
wives
,
I
am
not
sure
that
I
may
not
do
even
that
some
day
.
<EOS>
Has
Lord
Fawn
been
here
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
shook
her
head
.
"
<EOS>
Or
written
?
"
<EOS>
Again
she
shook
her
head
.
<EOS>
As
she
did
so
the
long
curl
waved
and
was
very
near
to
him
,
for
he
was
sitting
close
to
the
sofa
,
and
she
had
raised
herself
so
that
she
might
look
into
his
face
and
speak
to
him
almost
in
a
whisper
.
<EOS>
"
Something
should
be
settled
,
Lizzie
,
before
you
leave
town
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wrote
to
him
,
yesterday
,
 
one
line
,
and
desired
him
to
come
.
<EOS>
I
expected
him
here
to
-
day
,
but
you
have
come
instead
.
<EOS>
Shall
I
say
that
I
am
disappointed
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
doubt
you
are
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Frank
,
how
vain
you
men
are
!
<EOS>
You
want
me
to
swear
to
you
that
I
would
sooner
have
you
with
me
than
him
.
<EOS>
You
are
not
content
with
 
thinking
it
,
unless
I
tell
you
that
it
is
so
.
<EOS>
You
know
that
it
is
so
.
<EOS>
Though
he
is
to
be
my
husband
,
 
I
suppose
he
will
be
my
husband
,
 
his
spirit
is
not
congenial
to
mine
,
as
is
yours
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Had
you
not
loved
him
you
would
not
have
accepted
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
was
I
to
do
,
Frank
?
<EOS>
What
am
I
to
do
?
<EOS>
Think
how
desolate
I
am
,
how
unfriended
,
how
much
in
want
of
some
one
whom
I
can
call
a
protector
!
<EOS>
I
can
not
have
you
always
with
me
.
<EOS>
You
care
more
for
the
little
finger
of
that
prim
piece
of
propriety
down
at
the
old
dowager
's
than
you
do
for
me
and
all
my
sorrows
.
<EOS>
"
This
was
true
,
but
Frank
did
not
say
that
it
was
true
.
"
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
is
at
any
rate
respectable
.
<EOS>
At
least
,
I
thought
he
was
so
when
I
accepted
his
offer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
respectable
enough
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Just
that
;
 
is
n't
it
?
 
<EOS>
and
nothing
more
.
<EOS>
You
do
not
blame
me
for
saying
that
I
would
be
his
wife
?
<EOS>
If
you
do
,
I
will
unsay
it
,
let
it
cost
me
what
it
may
.
<EOS>
He
is
treating
me
so
badly
that
I
need
not
go
far
for
an
excuse
.
<EOS>
"
Then
she
looked
into
his
face
with
all
the
eagerness
of
her
gaze
,
clearly
implying
that
she
expected
a
serious
answer
.
<EOS>
"
Why
do
you
not
answer
me
,
Frank
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
am
I
to
say
?
<EOS>
He
is
a
timid
,
cautious
man
.
<EOS>
They
have
frightened
him
about
this
trumpery
necklace
,
and
he
is
behaving
badly
.
<EOS>
But
he
will
make
a
good
husband
.
<EOS>
He
is
not
a
spendthrift
.
<EOS>
He
has
rank
.
<EOS>
All
his
people
are
respectable
.
<EOS>
As
Lady
Fawn
,
any
house
in
England
will
be
open
to
you
.
<EOS>
He
is
not
rich
,
but
together
you
will
be
rich
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
all
that
without
love
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
doubt
his
love
.
<EOS>
And
when
you
are
his
own
he
will
love
you
dearly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
yes
;
 
as
he
would
a
horse
or
a
picture
.
<EOS>
Is
there
anything
of
the
rapture
of
love
in
that
?
<EOS>
Is
that
your
idea
of
love
?
<EOS>
Is
it
<EOS>
so
you
love
your
Miss
Demure
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
n't
call
names
,
Lizzie
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
say
what
I
please
of
her
.
<EOS>
You
and
I
are
to
be
friends
,
and
I
may
not
speak
?
<EOS>
No
;
 
I
will
have
no
such
friendship
!
<EOS>
She
is
demure
.
<EOS>
If
you
like
it
,
what
harm
is
there
in
my
saying
it
?
<EOS>
I
am
not
demure
.
<EOS>
I
know
that
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
,
at
least
,
pretend
to
be
other
than
I
am
.
<EOS>
When
she
becomes
your
wife
,
I
wonder
whether
you
will
like
her
ways
?
"
<EOS>
He
had
not
yet
told
her
that
she
was
to
be
his
wife
,
nor
did
he
so
tell
her
now
.
<EOS>
He
thought
for
a
moment
that
he
had
better
tell
her
,
but
he
did
not
do
so
.
<EOS>
It
would
,
he
said
to
himself
,
add
an
embarrassment
to
his
present
position
.
<EOS>
And
as
the
marriage
was
to
be
postponed
for
a
year
,
it
might
be
better
,
perhaps
,
for
Lucy
that
it
should
not
be
declared
openly
.
<EOS>
It
was
thus
he
argued
with
himself
,
but
yet
,
no
doubt
,
he
knew
well
that
he
did
not
declare
the
truth
because
it
would
take
away
something
of
its
sweetness
from
this
friendship
with
his
cousin
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
ever
I
do
marry
,
"
he
said
,
"
I
hope
I
shall
like
my
wife
's
ways
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
you
will
not
tell
me
anything
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
expect
confidence
from
you
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
a
man
is
ever
able
to
work
himself
up
to
the
mark
of
true
confidence
with
his
friend
.
<EOS>
Men
together
,
when
they
like
each
other
,
talk
of
politics
,
or
perhaps
of
money
;
but
I
doubt
whether
they
ever
really
tell
their
thoughts
and
longings
to
each
other
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Are
women
more
communicative
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
 
certainly
.
<EOS>
What
is
there
that
I
would
not
tell
you
if
you
cared
to
hear
it
?
<EOS>
Every
thought
I
have
is
open
to
you
if
you
choose
to
read
it
.
<EOS>
I
have
that
feeling
regarding
you
that
I
would
keep
nothing
back
from
you
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
Frank
,
if
you
understood
me
,
you
could
save
me
,
 
<EOS>
I
was
going
to
say
 
from
all
unhappiness
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
did
it
so
well
that
he
would
have
been
more
than
man
<EOS>
had
he
not
believed
some
of
it
.
<EOS>
She
was
sitting
almost
upright
now
,
though
her
feet
were
still
on
the
sofa
,
and
was
leaning
over
towards
him
,
as
though
imploring
him
for
his
aid
,
and
her
eyes
were
full
of
tears
,
and
her
lips
were
apart
as
though
still
eager
with
the
energy
of
expression
,
and
her
hands
were
clasped
together
.
<EOS>
She
was
very
lovely
,
very
attractive
,
almost
invincible
.
<EOS>
For
such
a
one
as
Frank
Greystock
opposition
to
her
in
her
present
mood
was
impossible
.
<EOS>
There
are
men
by
whom
a
woman
,
if
she
have
wit
,
beauty
,
and
no
conscience
,
can
not
be
withstood
.
<EOS>
Arms
may
be
used
against
them
,
and
a
sort
of
battle
waged
,
against
which
they
can
raise
no
shield
,
 
from
which
they
can
retire
into
no
fortress
,
 
in
which
they
can
parry
no
blow
.
<EOS>
A
man
so
weak
and
so
attacked
may
sometimes
run
;
but
even
the
poor
chance
of
running
is
often
cut
off
from
him
.
<EOS>
How
unlike
she
was
to
Lucy
!
<EOS>
He
believed
her
,
 
in
part
;
and
yet
that
was
the
idea
that
occurred
to
him
.
<EOS>
When
Lucy
was
much
in
earnest
,
in
her
eye
,
too
,
a
tear
would
sparkle
,
the
smallest
drop
,
a
bright
liquid
diamond
that
never
fell
;
and
all
her
face
would
be
bright
and
eloquent
with
feeling
;
 
but
how
unlike
were
the
two
!
<EOS>
He
knew
that
the
difference
was
that
between
truth
and
falsehood
;
 
and
yet
he
partly
believed
the
falsehood
!
<EOS>
"
If
I
knew
how
to
save
you
from
an
hour
's
uneasiness
,
I
would
do
it
,
"
he
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
 
no
;
 
no
;
"
she
murmured
.
  
<EOS>
"
Would
I
not
?
<EOS>
You
do
not
know
me
then
.
<EOS>
"
He
had
nothing
further
to
say
,
and
it
suited
her
to
remain
silent
for
the
moment
,
while
she
dried
her
eyes
,
and
recovered
her
composure
,
and
prepared
herself
to
carry
on
the
battle
with
a
smile
.
<EOS>
She
would
carry
on
the
battle
,
using
every
wile
she
knew
,
straining
every
nerve
to
be
victorious
,
encountering
any
and
all
dangers
,
and
yet
she
had
no
definite
aim
before
her
.
<EOS>
She
herself
did
not
know
what
she
would
be
at
.
<EOS>
At
this
period
of
her
career
she
did
not
want
to
marry
her
cousin
,
 
having
resolved
that
she
would
be
Lady
Fawn
.
<EOS>
Nor
did
she
intend
that
her
cousin
should
be
her
lover
,
 
in
the
ordinary
sense
of
love
.
<EOS>
She
was
far
too
wary
in
the
pursuit
of
the
world
's
goods
to
sacrifice
herself
to
any
such
wish
as
that
.
<EOS>
She
did
want
him
to
help
her
about
the
diamonds
,
 
but
such
help
as
that
she
might
have
,
as
she
knew
well
,
on
much
easier
terms
.
<EOS>
There
was
probably
an
anxiety
in
her
bosom
to
cause
him
to
be
untrue
to
Lucy
Morris
;
but
the
guiding
motive
of
her
conduct
was
the
desire
to
make
things
seem
to
be
other
than
they
were
.
<EOS>
To
be
always
acting
a
part
rather
than
living
her
own
life
was
to
her
everything
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
After
all
we
must
come
to
facts
,
"
he
said
,
after
a
while
.
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
it
will
be
better
that
you
should
marry
Lord
Fawn
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
wish
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nay
;
 
I
can
not
have
that
said
.
<EOS>
In
this
matter
you
must
rule
yourself
by
your
own
judgment
.
<EOS>
If
you
are
averse
to
it
 
<EOS>
"
She
shook
her
head
.
<EOS>
"
Then
you
will
own
that
it
had
better
be
so
.
"
<EOS>
Again
she
shook
her
head
.
<EOS>
"
Lizzie
,
for
your
sake
and
my
own
,
I
must
declare
,
that
if
you
have
no
opinion
in
this
matter
,
neither
will
I
have
any
.
<EOS>
You
shall
never
have
to
say
that
I
pressed
you
into
this
marriage
or
debarred
you
from
marrying
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
bear
such
an
accusation
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
might
tell
me
what
I
ought
to
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
 
certainly
not
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Think
how
young
I
am
,
and
,
 
by
comparison
,
 
how
old
you
are
.
<EOS>
You
are
eight
years
older
than
I
am
.
<EOS>
Remember
;
 
after
all
that
I
have
gone
through
,
I
am
but
twenty
-
two
.
<EOS>
At
my
age
other
girls
have
their
friends
to
tell
them
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
one
,
 
unless
you
will
tell
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
accepted
him
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
he
is
not
altogether
indifferent
to
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
paused
,
and
again
shook
her
head
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Indeed
,
I
do
not
know
.
<EOS>
If
you
mean
,
do
I
love
him
,
as
I
could
love
some
man
whose
heart
was
quite
congenial
to
my
own
,
certainly
I
do
not
.
"
<EOS>
She
continued
to
shake
her
head
very
sadly
.
<EOS>
"
I
esteemed
him
,
 
when
he
asked
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Say
at
once
that
,
having
made
up
your
mind
,
you
will
go
through
with
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
think
that
I
ought
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
think
so
,
 
yourself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
So
be
it
,
Frank
.
<EOS>
I
will
.
<EOS>
But
,
Frank
,
I
will
not
give
up
my
property
.
<EOS>
You
do
not
wish
me
to
do
that
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
weak
,
now
;
 
would
it
not
?
<EOS>
I
am
sure
that
it
is
my
own
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
His
faith
to
you
should
not
depend
on
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
of
course
not
;
that
is
just
what
I
mean
.
<EOS>
He
can
have
no
right
to
interfere
.
<EOS>
When
he
asked
me
to
be
his
wife
,
he
said
nothing
about
that
.
<EOS>
But
if
he
does
not
come
to
me
,
what
shall
I
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
I
had
better
see
him
,
"
said
Frank
slowly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
?
<EOS>
That
will
be
so
good
of
you
.
<EOS>
I
feel
that
I
can
leave
it
all
so
safely
in
your
hands
.
<EOS>
I
shall
go
out
of
town
,
you
know
,
on
the
thirtieth
.
<EOS>
I
feel
that
I
shall
be
better
away
,
and
I
am
sick
of
all
the
noise
,
and
glitter
,
and
worldliness
of
London
.
<EOS>
You
will
come
on
the
twelfth
?
"
  
"
Not
quite
so
soon
as
that
,
"
he
said
,
after
a
pause
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
will
come
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
 
about
the
twentieth
.
"
  
"
And
,
of
course
,
I
shall
see
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
yes
.
"
  
"
So
that
I
may
have
some
one
to
guide
me
that
I
can
trust
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
brother
,
Frank
;
do
you
ever
think
of
that
?
"
<EOS>
She
put
out
her
hand
to
him
,
and
he
clasped
it
,
and
held
it
tight
in
his
own
;
and
then
,
after
a
while
,
he
pulled
her
towards
him
.
<EOS>
In
a
moment
she
was
on
the
ground
,
kneeling
at
his
feet
,
and
his
arm
was
round
her
shoulder
,
and
his
hand
was
on
her
back
,
and
he
was
embracing
her
.
<EOS>
Her
face
was
turned
up
to
him
,
and
he
pressed
his
lips
upon
her
forehead
.
"
<EOS>
As
my
brother
,
"
she
said
,
stretching
back
her
head
and
looking
up
into
his
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
 
as
your
brother
.
"
  
<EOS>
They
were
sitting
,
or
rather
acting
their
little
play
together
,
in
the
back
drawing
-
room
,
and
the
ordinary
entrance
to
the
two
rooms
was
from
the
landing
-
place
into
the
larger
apartment
;
 
of
which
fact
<EOS>
Lizzie
was
probably
aware
,
when
she
permitted
herself
to
fall
into
a
position
as
to
which
a
moment
or
two
might
be
wanted
for
recovery
.
<EOS>
When
,
therefore
,
the
servant
in
livery
opened
the
door
,
which
he
did
,
as
Frank
thought
somewhat
suddenly
,
she
was
able
to
be
standing
on
her
legs
before
she
was
caught
.
<EOS>
The
quickness
with
which
she
sprung
from
her
position
,
and
the
facility
with
which
she
composed
not
her
face
only
,
but
the
loose
lock
of
her
hair
and
all
her
person
,
for
the
reception
of
the
coming
visitor
,
was
quite
marvellous
.
<EOS>
About
her
there
was
none
of
the
look
of
having
been
found
out
,
which
is
so
very
disagreeable
to
the
wearer
of
it
;
whereas
Frank
,
when
Lord
Fawn
was
announced
,
was
aware
that
his
manner
was
awkward
,
and
his
general
appearance
flurried
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
was
no
more
flurried
than
if
she
had
stepped
that
moment
from
out
of
the
hands
of
her
tirewoman
.
<EOS>
She
greeted
Lord
Fawn
very
prettily
,
holding
him
by
the
hand
long
enough
to
show
that
she
had
more
claim
to
do
so
than
could
any
other
woman
,
and
then
she
just
murmured
her
cousin
's
name
.
<EOS>
The
two
men
shook
hands
 
and
looked
at
each
other
as
men
do
who
know
that
they
are
not
friends
,
and
think
that
they
may
live
to
be
enemies
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
,
who
rarely
forgot
anything
,
had
certainly
not
forgotten
the
Sawab
;
and
Frank
was
aware
that
he
might
soon
be
called
on
to
address
his
lordship
in
anything
but
friendly
terms
.
<EOS>
They
said
,
however
,
a
few
words
about
Parliament
and
the
weather
,
and
the
desirability
of
escaping
from
London
.
  
<EOS>
"
Frank
,
"
said
Lady
Eustace
,
"
is
coming
down
in
August
to
shoot
my
three
annual
grouse
at
Portray
.
<EOS>
He
would
keep
one
for
you
,
my
lord
,
if
he
thought
you
would
come
for
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
promise
Lord
Fawn
a
fair
third
,
at
any
rate
,
"
said
Frank
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
visit
Portray
this
August
,
I
'm
afraid
,
"
said
his
lordship
,
"
much
as
I
might
wish
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
One
of
us
must
remain
at
the
India
Office
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
that
weary
India
Office
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
almost
think
you
official
men
are
worse
off
than
we
barristers
,
"
said
Frank
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
Lizzie
,
good
-
bye
.
<EOS>
I
dare
say
I
shall
see
you
again
before
you
start
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
you
will
,
"
said
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
And
then
the
two
lovers
were
left
together
.
<EOS>
They
had
met
once
,
at
Lady
Glencora
's
ball
,
since
the
quarrel
at
Fawn
Court
,
and
there
,
as
though
by
mutual
forbearance
,
had
not
alluded
to
their
troubles
.
<EOS>
Now
he
had
come
,
especially
to
speak
of
the
matter
that
concerned
them
both
so
deeply
.
<EOS>
As
long
as
Frank
Greystock
was
in
the
room
,
his
work
was
comparatively
easy
,
but
he
had
known
beforehand
that
he
would
not
find
it
at
all
easy
should
he
be
left
alone
with
her
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
began
.
<EOS>
"
My
lord
,
"
she
said
,
"
considering
all
that
has
passed
between
us
,
you
have
been
a
truant
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
 
I
admit
it
 
<EOS>
but
 
"
  
"
With
me
,
my
lord
,
a
fault
admitted
is
a
fault
forgiven
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Then
she
took
her
old
seat
on
the
sofa
,
and
he
placed
himself
on
the
chair
which
Frank
Greystock
had
occupied
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
intended
to
own
a
fault
,
and
certainly
not
to
accept
forgiveness
;
but
she
had
been
too
quick
for
him
;
and
now
he
could
not
find
words
by
which
to
express
himself
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
In
truth
,
"
she
continued
,
"
I
would
always
rather
remember
one
kindness
than
a
dozen
omissions
on
the
part
of
a
friend
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Lady
Eustace
,
I
have
not
willingly
omitted
anything
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
So
be
it
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
give
you
the
slightest
excuse
for
saying
that
you
have
heard
a
reproach
from
me
.
<EOS>
You
have
come
at
last
,
and
you
are
welcome
.
<EOS>
Is
that
enough
for
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
had
much
to
say
to
her
about
the
diamonds
,
and
,
when
he
was
entering
the
room
,
he
had
not
a
word
to
say
to
her
about
anything
else
.
<EOS>
Since
that
,
another
subject
had
sprung
up
before
him
.
<EOS>
Whether
he
was
,
or
was
not
,
to
regard
himself
as
being
at
this
moment
engaged
to
marry
Lady
Eustace
,
was
a
matter
to
him
of
much
doubt
;
 
but
of
this
he
was
sure
,
that
if
she
were
engaged
to
him
as
his
wife
<EOS>
,
she
ought
not
to
be
entertaining
her
cousin
Frank
Greystock
down
at
Portray
Castle
,
unless
she
had
some
old
lady
,
not
only
respectable
in
life
,
but
high
in
rank
also
,
to
see
that
everything
was
right
.
<EOS>
It
was
almost
an
insult
to
him
that
such
a
visit
should
have
been
arranged
without
his
sanction
or
cognizance
.
<EOS>
Of
course
,
if
he
were
bound
by
no
engagement
,
 
and
he
had
been
persuaded
by
his
mother
and
sister
to
wish
that
he
were
not
bound
,
 
then
the
matter
would
be
no
affair
of
his
.
<EOS>
If
,
however
,
the
diamonds
were
abandoned
,
then
the
engagement
was
to
be
continued
;
 
and
in
that
case
it
was
out
of
the
question
that
his
elected
bride
should
entertain
another
young
man
,
 
even
though
she
was
a
widow
and
the
young
man
was
her
cousin
.
<EOS>
Of
course
,
he
should
have
spoken
of
the
diamonds
first
;
but
the
other
matter
had
obtruded
itself
upon
him
,
and
he
was
puzzled
.
<EOS>
"
Is
Mr.
Greystock
to
accompany
you
into
Scotland
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
dear
<EOS>
no
.
<EOS>
I
go
on
the
thirtieth
of
this
month
.
<EOS>
I
hardly
know
when
he
means
to
be
there
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
follows
you
to
Portray
?
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
 
he
follows
me
,
of
course
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
king
himself
has
followed
her
,
When
she
has
gone
before
.
"
<EOS>
"
Lord
Fawn
did
not
remember
the
quotation
,
and
was
more
puzzled
than
ever
.
"
<EOS>
Frank
will
follow
me
,
just
as
the
other
shooting
men
will
follow
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
goes
direct
to
Portray
Castle
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Neither
directly
nor
indirectly
.
<EOS>
Just
at
present
,
Lord
Fawn
,
I
am
in
no
mood
to
entertain
guests
,
 
not
even
one
that
I
love
so
well
as
my
cousin
Frank
.
<EOS>
The
Portray
mountains
are
somewhat
extensive
,
and
at
the
back
of
them
there
is
a
little
shooting
-
lodge
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
indeed
,
"
said
Lord
Fawn
,
feeling
that
he
had
better
dash
at
once
at
the
diamonds
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
,
my
lord
,
could
manage
to
join
us
for
a
day
,
my
cousin
and
his
friend
would
,
I
am
sure
,
come
over
to
the
castle
,
so
that
you
should
not
suffer
from
being
left
alone
with
me
and
Miss
Macnulty
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
At
present
it
is
impossible
,
"
said
Lord
Fawn
;
 
and
then
he
paused
.
"
<EOS>
Lady
Eustace
,
the
position
in
which
you
and
I
stand
to
each
other
is
one
not
altogether
free
from
trouble
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
can
not
say
that
it
is
of
my
making
,
"
she
said
,
with
a
smile
.
<EOS>
"
You
once
asked
 
what
men
think
a
favour
from
me
;
and
I
granted
it
,
 
perhaps
too
easily
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
how
greatly
I
am
indebted
to
your
goodness
,
Lady
Eustace
 
"
And
then
again
he
paused
.
  
<EOS>
"
Lord
Fawn
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
trust
you
will
believe
that
nothing
can
be
further
from
me
than
that
you
should
be
harassed
by
any
conduct
of
mine
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
harassed
,
my
lord
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
so
am
I.
<EOS>
I
have
learned
that
you
are
in
possession
of
certain
jewels
which
I
can
not
allow
to
be
held
by
my
wife
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
your
wife
,
Lord
Fawn
.
"
<EOS>
As
she
said
this
,
she
rose
from
her
reclining
posture
and
sat
erect
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
true
.
<EOS>
You
are
not
.
<EOS>
But
you
said
you
would
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Go
on
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
the
pride
of
my
life
to
think
that
I
had
attained
to
so
much
happiness
.
<EOS>
Then
came
this
matter
of
the
diamonds
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
business
have
you
with
my
diamonds
,
 
more
than
any
other
man
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Simply
that
I
am
told
that
they
are
not
yours
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Who
tells
you
so
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Various
people
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Camperdown
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
If
you
,
my
lord
,
intend
to
take
an
attorney
's
word
against
mine
,
and
that
on
a
matter
as
to
which
no
one
but
myself
can
know
the
truth
,
then
you
are
not
fit
to
be
my
husband
.
<EOS>
The
diamonds
are
my
own
,
and
should
you
and
I
become
man
and
wife
<EOS>
,
they
must
remain
so
by
special
settlement
.
<EOS>
While
I
choose
to
keep
them
they
will
be
mine
,
 
to
do
with
them
as
I
please
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
my
pleasure
,
when
my
boy
marries
,
to
hang
them
round
his
bride
's
neck
.
"
<EOS>
She
carried
herself
well
,
and
spoke
her
words
with
dignity
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
I
have
got
to
say
is
this
,
"
began
Lord
Fawn
;
 
"
I
must
consider
our
engagement
as
at
an
end
unless
you
will
give
them
up
to
Mr.
Camperdown
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
give
them
up
to
Mr.
Camperdown
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
,
 
then
,
 
then
,
 
"
  
"
And
I
make
bold
to
tell
you
,
Lord
Fawn
,
that
you
are
not
behaving
to
me
like
a
man
of
honour
.
<EOS>
I
shall
now
leave
the
matter
in
the
hands
of
my
cousin
,
Mr.
Greystock
.
<EOS>
"
Then
she
sailed
out
of
the
room
,
and
Lord
Fawn
was
driven
to
escape
from
the
house
as
he
might
.
<EOS>
He
stood
about
the
room
for
five
minutes
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
,
and
then
walked
down
and
let
himself
out
of
the
front
door
.
   
<EOS>
The
Diamonds
Become
Troublesome
 
<EOS>
The
thirtieth
of
July
came
round
,
and
Lizzie
was
prepared
for
her
journey
down
to
Scotland
.
<EOS>
She
was
to
be
accompanied
by
Miss
Macnulty
and
her
own
maid
and
her
own
servants
,
and
to
travel
,
of
course
,
like
a
grand
lady
.
<EOS>
She
had
not
seen
Lord
Fawn
since
the
meeting
recorded
in
the
last
chapter
,
but
had
seen
her
cousin
Frank
nearly
every
other
day
.
<EOS>
He
,
after
much
consideration
,
had
written
a
long
letter
to
Lord
Fawn
,
in
which
he
had
given
that
nobleman
to
understand
that
some
explanation
was
required
as
to
conduct
which
Frank
described
as
being
to
him
"
at
present
unintelligible
.
"
<EOS>
He
then
went
,
at
considerable
length
,
into
the
matter
of
the
diamonds
,
with
the
object
of
proving
that
Lord
Fawn
could
have
no
possible
right
to
interfere
in
the
matter
.
<EOS>
And
though
he
had
from
the
first
wished
that
Lizzie
would
give
up
the
trinket
,
he
made
various
points
in
her
favour
.
<EOS>
Not
only
had
they
been
given
to
his
cousin
by
her
late
husband
,
 
but
even
had
they
not
been
so
given
,
they
would
have
been
hers
by
will
.
<EOS>
Sir
Florian
had
left
her
everything
that
was
within
the
walls
of
Portray
Castle
,
and
the
diamonds
had
been
at
Portray
at
the
time
of
Sir
Florian
's
death
.
<EOS>
Such
was
Frank
's
statement
,
 
untrue
indeed
,
but
believed
by
him
to
be
true
.
<EOS>
This
was
one
of
Lizzie
's
lies
,
forged
as
soon
as
she
understood
that
some
subsidiary
claim
might
be
made
upon
them
on
the
ground
that
they
formed
a
portion
of
property
left
by
will
away
from
her
;
 
some
claim
subsidiary
to
the
grand
claim
,
that
the
necklace
was
a
family
heirloom
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
was
not
in
the
least
shaken
in
his
conviction
that
Lizzie
had
behaved
,
and
was
behaving
,
badly
,
and
that
,
therefore
,
he
had
better
get
rid
of
her
;
but
he
knew
that
he
must
be
very
wary
in
the
reasons
he
would
give
for
jilting
her
.
<EOS>
He
wrote
,
therefore
,
a
very
short
note
to
Greystock
,
promising
that
any
explanation
needed
should
be
given
as
soon
as
circumstances
should
admit
of
his
forming
a
decision
.
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
,
the
30th
of
July
came
,
and
Lady
Eustace
was
ready
for
her
journey
.
  
<EOS>
There
is
,
or
there
was
,
a
train
leaving
London
for
Carlisle
at
11
a.m.
,
by
which
Lizzie
proposed
to
travel
,
so
that
she
might
sleep
in
that
city
and
go
on
through
Dumfries
to
Portray
the
next
morning
.
<EOS>
This
was
her
scheme
;
but
there
was
another
part
of
her
scheme
as
to
which
she
had
felt
much
doubt
.
<EOS>
Should
she
leave
the
diamonds
,
or
should
she
take
them
with
her
?
<EOS>
The
iron
box
in
which
they
were
kept
was
small
,
and
so
far
portable
that
a
strong
man
might
carry
it
without
much
trouble
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
Lizzie
could
move
it
from
one
part
of
the
room
to
the
other
,
and
she
had
often
done
so
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
so
heavy
that
it
could
not
be
taken
with
her
without
attracting
attention
.
<EOS>
The
servant
would
know
what
it
was
,
and
the
porter
would
know
,
and
Miss
Macnulty
would
know
.
<EOS>
That
her
own
maid
should
know
was
a
matter
of
course
;
but
even
to
her
own
maid
the
journey
of
the
jewels
would
be
remarkable
because
of
the
weight
of
the
box
,
whereas
if
they
went
with
her
other
jewels
in
her
dressing
-
case
,
there
would
be
nothing
remarkable
.
<EOS>
She
might
even
have
taken
them
in
her
pocket
,
 
had
she
dared
.
<EOS>
But
she
did
not
dare
.
<EOS>
Though
she
was
intelligent
and
courageous
,
she
was
wonderfully
ignorant
as
to
what
might
<EOS>
and
what
might
not
be
done
for
the
recovery
of
the
necklace
by
Mr.
Camperdown
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
dare
to
take
them
without
the
iron
box
,
and
at
last
she
decided
that
the
box
should
go
.
<EOS>
At
a
little
after
ten
,
her
own
carriage
,
 
the
job
-
carriage
,
which
was
now
about
to
perform
its
last
journey
in
her
service
,
 
was
at
the
door
,
and
a
cab
was
there
for
the
servants
.
<EOS>
The
luggage
was
brought
down
,
and
with
the
larger
boxes
was
brought
the
iron
case
with
the
necklace
.
<EOS>
The
servant
,
certainly
making
more
of
the
weight
than
he
need
have
done
,
deposited
it
as
a
foot
-
stool
for
Lizzie
,
who
then
seated
herself
,
and
was
followed
by
Miss
Macnulty
.
<EOS>
She
would
have
it
placed
in
the
same
way
beneath
her
feet
in
the
railway
carriage
,
and
again
brought
into
her
room
at
the
Carlisle
hotel
.
<EOS>
What
though
the
porter
did
know
!
<EOS>
There
was
nothing
illegal
in
travelling
about
with
a
heavy
iron
box
full
of
diamonds
,
and
the
risk
would
be
less
this
way
,
she
thought
,
than
were
she
to
leave
them
behind
her
in
London
.
<EOS>
The
house
in
Mount
Street
,
which
she
had
taken
for
the
season
,
was
to
be
given
up
;
and
whom
could
she
trust
in
London
?
<EOS>
Her
very
bankers
,
she
feared
,
would
have
betrayed
her
,
and
given
up
her
treasure
to
Mr.
Camperdown
.
<EOS>
As
for
Messrs.
Harter
and
Benjamin
,
she
felt
sure
that
they
would
be
bribed
by
Mr.
Camperdown
.
<EOS>
She
once
thought
of
asking
her
cousin
to
take
the
charge
of
them
,
but
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
let
them
out
of
her
own
hands
.
<EOS>
Ten
thousand
pounds
!
<EOS>
If
she
could
only
sell
them
and
get
the
money
,
from
what
a
world
of
trouble
would
she
be
relieved
.
<EOS>
And
the
sale
,
for
another
reason
,
would
have
been
convenient
;
for
Lady
Eustace
was
already
a
little
in
debt
.
<EOS>
But
she
could
not
sell
them
,
and
therefore
when
she
got
into
the
carriage
there
was
the
box
under
her
feet
.
  
<EOS>
At
that
very
moment
who
should
appear
on
the
pavement
,
standing
between
the
carriage
and
the
house
-
door
,
but
Mr.
Camperdown
!
<EOS>
And
with
Mr.
Camperdown
there
was
another
man
,
 
a
very
suspicious
-
looking
man
,
 
whom
Lizzie
at
once
took
to
be
a
detective
officer
of
police
.
"
<EOS>
Lady
Eustace
!
"
said
Mr.
Camperdown
,
taking
off
his
hat
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
bowed
across
Miss
Macnulty
,
and
endeavoured
to
restrain
the
tell
-
tale
blood
from
flying
to
her
cheeks
.
<EOS>
"
I
believe
,
"
said
Mr.
Camperdown
,
"
that
you
are
now
starting
for
Scotland
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
are
,
Mr.
Camperdown
;
 
and
we
are
very
late
.
"
  
"
Could
you
allow
me
two
minutes
"
conversation
with
you
in
the
house
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
dear
,
no
.
<EOS>
We
are
late
,
I
tell
you
.
<EOS>
What
a
time
you
have
chosen
for
coming
,
Mr.
Camperdown
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
an
awkward
hour
,
Lady
Eustace
.
<EOS>
I
only
heard
this
morning
that
you
were
going
so
soon
,
and
it
is
imperative
that
I
should
see
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Had
you
not
better
write
,
Mr.
Camperdown
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
never
answer
my
letters
,
madam
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
I
 
<EOS>
I
 
<EOS>
I
really
can
not
see
you
now
.
<EOS>
William
,
the
coachman
must
drive
on
.
<EOS>
We
can
not
allow
ourselves
to
lose
the
train
.
<EOS>
I
am
really
very
sorry
,
Mr.
Camperdown
,
but
we
must
not
lose
the
train
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Lady
Eustace
,
"
said
Mr.
Camperdown
,
putting
his
hand
on
the
carriage
-
door
,
and
so
demeaning
himself
that
the
coachman
did
not
dare
to
drive
on
,
"
I
must
ask
you
a
question
.
"
<EOS>
He
spoke
in
a
low
voice
,
but
he
was
speaking
across
Miss
Macnulty
.
<EOS>
That
lady
,
therefore
,
heard
him
,
and
so
did
William
,
the
servant
,
who
was
standing
close
to
the
door
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
insist
on
knowing
where
are
the
Eustace
diamonds
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Lizzie
felt
the
box
beneath
her
feet
,
and
,
without
showing
that
she
did
so
,
somewhat
widened
her
drapery
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
tell
you
nothing
now
.
<EOS>
William
,
make
the
coachman
drive
on
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
will
not
answer
me
,
I
must
tell
you
that
I
shall
be
driven
in
the
execution
of
my
duty
to
obtain
a
search
-
warrant
,
in
order
that
they
may
be
placed
in
proper
custody
.
<EOS>
They
are
not
your
property
,
and
must
be
taken
out
of
your
hands
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lizzie
looked
at
the
suspicious
man
with
a
frightened
gaze
.
<EOS>
The
suspicious
man
was
,
in
fact
,
a
very
respectable
clerk
in
Mr.
Camperdown
's
employment
,
but
Lizzie
for
a
moment
felt
that
the
search
was
about
to
begin
at
once
.
<EOS>
She
had
hardly
understood
the
threat
,
and
thought
that
the
attorney
was
already
armed
with
the
powers
of
which
he
spoke
.
<EOS>
She
glanced
for
a
moment
at
Miss
Macnulty
,
and
then
at
the
servant
.
<EOS>
Would
they
betray
her
?
<EOS>
If
they
chose
to
use
force
to
her
,
the
box
certainly
might
be
taken
from
her
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
I
shall
lose
the
train
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
I
shall
.
<EOS>
I
must
insist
that
you
let
my
servant
drive
on
.
<EOS>
"
There
was
now
a
little
crowd
of
a
dozen
persons
on
the
pavement
,
and
there
was
nothing
to
cover
her
diamonds
but
the
skirt
of
her
travelling
-
dress
.
  
<EOS>
"
Are
they
in
this
house
,
Lady
Eustace
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
does
n't
he
go
on
?
"
shouted
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
no
right
,
sir
,
to
stop
me
.
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
be
stopped
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Or
have
you
got
them
with
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
answer
no
questions
.
<EOS>
You
have
no
right
to
treat
me
in
this
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
I
shall
be
forced
,
on
behalf
of
the
family
,
to
obtain
a
search
-
warrant
,
both
here
and
in
Ayrshire
,
and
proceedings
will
be
taken
also
against
your
ladyship
personally
.
"
<EOS>
So
saying
,
Mr.
Camperdown
withdrew
,
and
at
last
the
carriage
was
driven
on
.
  
<EOS>
As
it
happened
,
there
was
time
enough
for
catching
the
train
,
 
and
to
spare
.
<EOS>
The
whole
affair
in
Mount
Street
had
taken
less
than
ten
minutes
.
<EOS>
But
the
effect
upon
Lizzie
was
very
severe
.
<EOS>
For
a
while
she
could
not
speak
,
and
at
last
she
burst
out
into
hysteric
tears
,
 
not
a
sham
fit
,
 
but
a
true
convulsive
agony
of
sobbing
.
<EOS>
All
the
world
of
Mount
Street
,
including
her
own
servants
,
had
heard
the
accusation
against
her
.
<EOS>
During
the
whole
morning
she
had
been
wishing
that
she
had
never
seen
the
diamonds
;
but
now
it
was
almost
impossible
that
she
should
part
with
them
.
<EOS>
And
yet
they
were
like
a
load
upon
her
chest
,
a
load
as
heavy
as
though
she
were
compelled
to
sit
with
the
iron
box
on
her
lap
day
and
night
.
<EOS>
In
her
sobbing
she
felt
the
thing
under
her
feet
,
and
knew
that
she
could
not
get
rid
of
it
.
<EOS>
She
hated
the
box
,
and
yet
she
must
cling
to
it
now
.
<EOS>
She
was
thoroughly
ashamed
of
the
box
,
and
yet
she
must
seem
to
take
a
pride
in
it
.
<EOS>
She
was
horribly
afraid
of
the
box
,
and
yet
she
must
keep
it
in
her
own
very
bed
-
room
.
<EOS>
And
what
should
she
say
about
the
box
now
to
Miss
Macnulty
,
who
sat
by
her
side
,
stiff
and
scornful
,
offering
her
smelling
-
bottles
,
but
not
offering
her
sympathy
?
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
"
she
said
at
last
,
"
that
horrid
man
has
quite
upset
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
wonder
that
you
should
be
upset
,
"
said
Miss
Macnulty
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
so
unjust
,
too
,
 
so
false
,
 
<EOS>
so
 
<EOS>
so
 
<EOS>
so
 
.
<EOS>
They
are
my
own
as
much
as
that
umbrella
is
yours
,
Miss
Macnulty
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
,
"
said
Miss
Macnulty
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
tell
you
,
"
said
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
I
mean
is
,
that
it
is
such
a
pity
there
should
be
a
doubt
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
no
doubt
,
"
said
Lizzie
;
 
"
<EOS>
how
dare
you
say
there
is
a
doubt
?
<EOS>
My
cousin
,
Mr.
Greystock
,
says
that
there
is
not
the
slightest
doubt
.
<EOS>
He
is
a
barrister
,
and
must
know
better
than
an
attorney
like
that
Mr.
Camperdown
.
<EOS>
"
By
this
time
they
were
at
the
Euston
Square
station
,
and
then
there
was
more
trouble
with
the
box
.
<EOS>
The
footman
struggled
with
it
into
the
waiting
-
room
,
and
the
porter
struggled
with
it
from
the
waiting
-
room
to
the
carriage
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
could
not
but
look
at
the
porter
as
he
carried
it
,
and
she
felt
sure
that
the
man
had
been
told
of
its
contents
and
was
struggling
with
the
express
view
of
adding
to
her
annoyance
.
<EOS>
The
same
thing
happened
at
Carlisle
,
where
the
box
was
carried
up
into
Lizzie
's
bedroom
by
the
footman
,
and
where
she
was
convinced
that
her
treasure
had
become
the
subject
of
conversation
for
the
whole
house
.
<EOS>
In
the
morning
people
looked
at
her
as
she
walked
down
the
long
platform
with
the
box
still
struggling
before
her
.
<EOS>
She
almost
wished
that
she
had
undertaken
its
carriage
herself
,
as
she
thought
that
even
she
could
have
managed
with
less
outward
show
of
effort
.
<EOS>
Her
own
servants
seemed
to
be
in
league
against
her
,
and
Miss
Macnulty
had
never
before
been
so
generally
unpleasant
.
<EOS>
Poor
Miss
Macnulty
,
who
had
a
conscientious
idea
of
doing
her
duty
,
and
who
always
attempted
to
give
an
adequate
return
for
the
bread
she
ate
,
could
not
so
far
overcome
the
effect
of
Mr.
Camperdown
's
visit
as
to
speak
on
any
subject
without
being
stiff
and
hard
.
<EOS>
And
she
suffered
,
too
,
from
the
box
,
 
to
such
a
degree
that
she
turned
over
in
her
mind
the
thought
of
leaving
Lizzie
,
if
any
other
possible
home
might
be
found
for
her
.
<EOS>
Who
would
willingly
live
with
a
woman
who
always
travelled
about
with
a
diamond
necklace
worth
ten
thousand
pounds
,
locked
up
in
an
iron
safe
,
 
and
that
necklace
not
her
own
property
.
  
<EOS>
But
at
last
Lady
Eustace
,
and
Miss
Macnulty
,
and
the
servants
,
 
and
the
iron
box
,
 
reached
Portray
Castle
in
safety
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ianthe
's
Soul
"
 
Lady
Eustace
had
been
rather
cross
on
the
journey
down
to
Scotland
,
and
had
almost
driven
the
unfortunate
Macnulty
to
think
that
Lady
Linlithgow
or
the
workhouse
would
be
better
than
this
young
tyrant
;
but
on
her
arrival
at
her
own
house
she
was
for
awhile
all
smiles
and
kindness
.
<EOS>
During
the
journey
she
had
been
angry
without
thought
,
but
was
almost
entitled
to
be
excused
for
her
anger
.
<EOS>
Could
Miss
Macnulty
have
realised
the
amount
of
oppression
inflicted
on
her
patroness
by
the
box
of
diamonds
she
would
have
forgiven
anything
.
<EOS>
Hitherto
there
had
been
some
secrecy
,
or
at
any
rate
some
privacy
attached
to
the
matter
;
but
now
that
odious
lawyer
had
discussed
the
matter
aloud
,
in
the
very
streets
,
in
the
presence
of
the
servants
,
and
Lady
Eustace
had
felt
that
it
was
discussed
also
by
every
porter
on
the
railway
from
London
down
to
Troon
,
<EOS>
the
station
in
Scotland
at
which
her
own
carriage
met
her
to
take
her
to
her
own
castle
.
<EOS>
The
night
at
Carlisle
had
been
terrible
to
her
,
and
the
diamonds
had
never
been
for
a
moment
off
her
mind
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
the
worst
of
it
all
was
that
her
own
man
-
servant
and
maid
-
servant
had
heard
the
claim
which
had
been
so
violently
made
by
Mr.
Camperdown
.
<EOS>
There
are
people
,
in
that
respect
very
fortunately
circumstanced
,
whose
servants
,
as
a
matter
of
course
,
know
all
their
affairs
,
have
an
interest
in
their
concerns
,
sympathise
with
their
demands
,
feel
their
wants
,
and
are
absolutely
at
one
with
them
.
<EOS>
But
in
such
cases
the
servants
are
really
known
,
and
are
almost
as
completely
a
part
of
the
family
as
the
sons
and
daughters
.
<EOS>
There
may
be
disruptions
and
quarrels
;
causes
may
arise
for
ending
the
existing
condition
of
things
;
but
while
this
condition
lasts
,
the
servants
in
such
households
are
,
for
the
most
part
,
only
too
well
inclined
to
fight
the
battles
of
their
employers
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Binns
,
the
butler
,
would
almost
foam
at
the
mouth
if
it
were
suggested
to
him
that
the
plate
at
Silvercup
Hall
was
not
the
undoubted
property
of
the
old
squire
;
and
Mrs.
Pouncebox
could
not
be
made
to
believe
,
by
any
amount
of
human
evidence
,
that
the
jewels
which
her
lady
has
worn
for
the
last
fifteen
years
are
not
her
ladyship
's
very
own
.
<EOS>
Binns
would
fight
for
the
plate
,
and
so
would
Pouncebox
for
the
jewels
,
almost
till
they
were
cut
to
pieces
.
<EOS>
The
preservation
of
these
treasures
on
behalf
of
those
who
paid
them
their
wages
and
fed
them
,
who
occasionally
scolded
them
,
but
always
succoured
them
,
would
be
their
point
of
honour
.
<EOS>
No
torture
would
get
the
key
of
the
cellar
from
Binns
;
no
threats
extract
from
Pouncebox
a
secret
of
the
toilet
.
<EOS>
But
poor
Lizzie
Eustace
had
no
Binns
and
no
Pouncebox
.
<EOS>
They
are
plants
that
grow
slowly
.
<EOS>
There
was
still
too
much
of
the
mushroom
about
Lady
Eustace
to
permit
of
her
possessing
such
treasures
.
<EOS>
Her
footman
was
six
feet
high
,
was
not
bad
looking
,
and
was
called
Thomas
.
<EOS>
She
knew
no
more
about
him
,
and
was
far
too
wise
to
expect
sympathy
from
him
,
or
other
aid
than
the
work
for
which
she
paid
him
.
<EOS>
Her
own
maid
was
somewhat
nearer
to
her
;
but
not
much
nearer
.
<EOS>
The
girl
's
name
was
Patience
Crabstick
,
and
she
could
do
hair
well
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
knew
but
<EOS>
little
more
of
her
than
that
.
  
<EOS>
Lizzie
considered
herself
still
to
be
engaged
to
be
married
to
Lord
Fawn
,
 
but
there
was
no
sympathy
to
be
had
in
that
quarter
.
<EOS>
Frank
Greystock
might
be
induced
to
sympathise
with
her
;
 
but
hardly
after
the
fashion
which
Lizzie
desired
.
<EOS>
And
then
sympathy
in
that
direction
would
be
so
dangerous
<EOS>
should
she
decide
upon
going
on
with
the
Fawn
marriage
.
<EOS>
For
the
present
she
had
quarrelled
with
Lord
Fawn
;
 
but
the
very
bitterness
of
that
quarrel
,
and
the
decision
with
which
her
betrothed
had
declared
his
intention
of
breaking
off
the
match
,
made
her
the
more
resolute
that
she
would
marry
him
.
<EOS>
During
her
journey
to
Portray
she
had
again
determined
that
he
should
be
her
husband
;
and
,
if
so
,
advanced
sympathy
,
 
sympathy
that
would
be
pleasantly
tender
with
her
cousin
Frank
,
would
be
dangerous
.
<EOS>
She
would
be
quite
willing
to
accept
even
Miss
Macnulty
's
sympathy
,
if
that
humble
lady
would
give
it
to
her
of
the
kind
she
wanted
.
<EOS>
She
declared
to
herself
that
she
could
pour
herself
out
on
Miss
Macnulty
's
bosom
,
and
mingle
her
tears
even
with
Miss
Macnulty
's
,
if
only
Miss
Macnulty
would
believe
in
her
.
<EOS>
If
Miss
Macnulty
would
be
enthusiastic
about
the
jewels
,
enthusiastic
as
to
the
wickedness
of
Lord
Fawn
,
enthusiastic
in
praising
Lizzie
herself
,
Lizzie
,
 
so
she
told
herself
,
 
would
have
showered
all
the
sweets
of
female
friendship
even
on
Miss
Macnulty
's
head
.
<EOS>
But
Miss
Macnulty
was
as
hard
as
a
deal
board
.
<EOS>
She
did
as
she
was
bidden
,
thereby
earning
her
bread
.
<EOS>
But
there
was
no
tenderness
in
her
;
 
<EOS>
no
delicacy
;
 
no
feeling
;
 
no
comprehension
.
<EOS>
It
was
thus
that
Lady
Eustace
judged
her
humble
companion
;
and
in
one
respect
she
judged
her
rightly
.
<EOS>
Miss
Macnulty
did
not
believe
in
Lady
Eustace
,
and
was
not
sufficiently
gifted
to
act
up
to
a
belief
which
she
did
not
entertain
.
  
<EOS>
Poor
Lizzie
!
<EOS>
The
world
,
in
judging
of
people
who
are
false
and
bad
and
selfish
and
prosperous
to
outward
appearances
,
is
apt
to
be
hard
upon
them
,
and
to
forget
the
punishments
which
generally
accompany
such
faults
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
Eustace
was
very
false
and
bad
and
selfish
,
 
and
,
we
may
say
,
very
prosperous
also
;
but
in
the
midst
of
all
she
was
thoroughly
uncomfortable
.
<EOS>
She
was
never
at
ease
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
green
spot
in
her
life
with
which
she
could
be
contented
.
<EOS>
And
though
,
after
a
fashion
,
she
knew
herself
to
be
false
and
bad
,
she
was
thoroughly
convinced
that
she
was
ill
-
used
by
everybody
about
her
.
<EOS>
She
was
being
very
badly
treated
by
Lord
Fawn
;
 
but
she
flattered
herself
that
she
would
be
able
to
make
Lord
Fawn
know
more
of
her
character
before
she
had
done
with
him
.
  
<EOS>
Portray
Castle
was
really
a
castle
,
 
not
simply
a
country
mansion
so
called
,
but
a
stone
edifice
with
battlements
and
a
round
tower
at
one
corner
,
and
a
gate
which
looked
as
if
it
might
have
had
a
portcullis
,
and
narrow
windows
in
a
portion
of
it
,
and
a
cannon
mounted
upon
a
low
roof
,
and
an
excavation
called
the
moat
,
 
but
which
was
now
a
fantastic
and
somewhat
picturesque
garden
,
 
running
round
two
sides
of
it
.
<EOS>
In
very
truth
,
though
a
portion
of
the
castle
was
undoubtedly
old
,
and
had
been
built
when
strength
was
needed
for
defence
and
probably
for
the
custody
of
booty
,
 
the
battlements
,
and
the
round
tower
,
and
the
awe
-
inspiring
gateway
had
all
been
added
by
one
of
the
late
Sir
Florians
.
<EOS>
But
the
castle
looked
like
a
castle
,
and
was
interesting
.
<EOS>
As
a
house
it
was
not
particularly
eligible
,
the
castle
form
of
domestic
architecture
being
exigeant
in
its
nature
,
and
demanding
that
space
,
which
in
less
ambitious
houses
can
be
applied
to
comfort
,
shall
be
surrendered
to
magnificence
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
great
hall
,
and
a
fine
dining
-
room
with
plate
-
glass
windows
looking
out
upon
the
sea
;
but
the
other
sitting
-
rooms
were
insignificant
,
and
the
bedrooms
were
here
and
there
,
and
were
for
the
most
part
small
and
dark
.
<EOS>
That
,
however
,
which
Lizzie
had
appropriated
to
her
own
use
was
a
grand
chamber
,
looking
also
out
upon
the
open
sea
.
  
<EOS>
The
castle
stood
upon
a
bluff
of
land
,
with
a
fine
prospect
of
the
Firth
of
Clyde
,
and
with
a
distant
view
of
the
Isle
of
Arran
.
<EOS>
When
the
air
was
clear
,
as
it
often
is
clear
there
,
the
Arran
hills
could
be
seen
from
Lizzie
's
window
,
and
she
was
proud
of
talking
of
the
prospect
.
<EOS>
In
other
respects
,
perhaps
,
the
castle
was
somewhat
desolate
.
<EOS>
There
were
a
few
stunted
trees
around
it
,
but
timber
had
not
prospered
there
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
grand
kitchen
garden
,
 
or
rather
a
kitchen
garden
which
had
been
intended
to
be
grand
;
 
but
since
Lizzie
's
reign
had
been
commenced
,
the
grandeur
had
been
neglected
.
<EOS>
Grand
kitchen
gardens
are
expensive
,
and
Lizzie
had
at
once
been
firm
in
reducing
the
under
-
gardeners
from
five
men
to
one
and
a
boy
.
<EOS>
The
head
-
gardener
had
of
course
left
her
at
once
;
but
that
had
not
broken
her
heart
,
and
she
had
hired
a
modest
man
at
a
guinea
a
week
instead
of
a
scientific
artist
,
who
was
by
no
means
modest
,
with
a
hundred
and
twenty
pounds
a
year
and
coals
,
house
,
milk
,
and
all
other
horticultural
luxuries
.
<EOS>
Though
Lizzie
was
prosperous
and
had
a
fine
income
,
she
was
already
aware
that
she
could
not
keep
up
a
town
and
country
establishment
and
be
a
rich
woman
on
four
thousand
a
year
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
flower
garden
and
small
shrubbery
within
the
so
-
called
moat
;
but
,
otherwise
,
the
grounds
of
Portray
Castle
were
not
alluring
.
<EOS>
The
place
was
sombre
,
exposed
,
and
,
in
winter
,
very
cold
;
and
,
except
that
the
expanse
of
sea
beneath
the
hill
on
which
stood
the
castle
was
fine
and
open
,
it
had
no
great
claim
to
praise
on
the
score
of
scenery
.
<EOS>
Behind
the
castle
,
and
away
from
the
sea
,
the
low
mountains
belonging
to
the
estate
stretched
for
some
eight
or
ten
miles
;
and
towards
the
further
end
of
them
,
where
stood
a
shooting
-
lodge
,
called
always
The
Cottage
,
the
landscape
became
rough
and
grand
.
<EOS>
It
was
in
this
cottage
that
Frank
Greystock
was
to
be
sheltered
with
his
friend
,
when
he
came
down
to
shoot
what
Lady
Eustace
had
called
her
three
annual
grouse
.
  
<EOS>
She
ought
to
have
been
happy
and
comfortable
.
<EOS>
There
will
,
of
course
,
be
some
to
say
that
a
young
widow
should
not
be
happy
and
comfortable
,
 
that
she
should
be
weeping
her
lost
lord
,
and
subject
to
the
desolation
of
bereavement
.
<EOS>
But
as
the
world
goes
now
,
young
widows
are
not
miserable
;
and
there
is
,
perhaps
,
a
growing
tendency
in
society
to
claim
from
them
year
by
year
still
less
of
any
misery
that
may
be
avoidable
.
<EOS>
Suttee
propensities
of
all
sorts
,
from
burning
alive
down
to
bombazine
and
hideous
forms
of
clothing
,
are
becoming
less
and
less
popular
among
the
nations
,
and
women
are
beginning
to
learn
that
,
let
what
misfortunes
will
come
upon
them
,
it
is
well
for
them
to
be
as
happy
as
their
nature
will
allow
them
to
be
.
<EOS>
A
woman
may
thoroughly
respect
her
husband
,
and
mourn
him
truly
,
honestly
,
with
her
whole
heart
,
and
yet
enjoy
thoroughly
the
good
things
which
he
has
left
behind
for
her
use
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
,
at
any
rate
,
sorrow
for
the
lost
Sir
Florian
that
made
Lady
Eustace
uncomfortable
.
<EOS>
She
had
her
child
.
<EOS>
She
had
her
income
.
<EOS>
She
had
her
youth
and
beauty
.
<EOS>
She
had
Portray
Castle
.
<EOS>
She
had
a
new
lover
,
 
and
,
if
she
chose
to
be
quit
of
him
,
not
liking
him
well
enough
for
the
purpose
,
she
might
undoubtedly
have
another
whom
she
would
like
better
.
<EOS>
She
had
hitherto
been
thoroughly
successful
in
her
life
.
<EOS>
And
yet
she
was
unhappy
.
<EOS>
What
was
it
that
she
wanted
?
  
<EOS>
She
had
been
a
very
clever
child
,
 
a
clever
,
crafty
child
;
and
now
she
was
becoming
a
clever
woman
.
<EOS>
Her
craft
remained
with
her
;
but
so
keen
was
her
outlook
upon
the
world
,
that
she
was
beginning
to
perceive
that
craft
,
let
it
be
never
so
crafty
,
will
in
the
long
run
miss
its
own
object
.
<EOS>
She
actually
envied
the
simplicity
of
Lucy
Morris
,
for
whom
she
delighted
to
find
evil
names
,
calling
her
demure
,
a
prig
,
a
sly
puss
,
and
so
on
.
<EOS>
But
she
could
see
,
 
or
half
see
,
 
that
Lucy
with
her
simplicity
was
stronger
than
was
she
with
her
craft
.
<EOS>
She
had
nearly
captivated
Frank
Greystock
with
her
wiles
,
but
without
any
wiles
Lucy
had
captivated
him
altogether
.
<EOS>
And
a
man
captivated
by
wiles
was
only
captivated
for
a
time
,
whereas
a
man
won
by
simplicity
would
be
won
for
ever
,
 
if
he
himself
were
worth
the
winning
.
<EOS>
And
this
,
too
,
she
felt
,
 
that
let
her
success
be
what
it
might
,
she
could
not
be
happy
unless
she
could
win
a
man
's
heart
.
<EOS>
She
had
won
Sir
Florian
's
,
but
that
had
been
but
for
an
hour
,
 
for
a
month
or
two
.
<EOS>
And
then
Sir
Florian
had
never
really
won
hers
.
<EOS>
Could
not
she
be
simple
?
<EOS>
Could
not
she
act
simplicity
so
well
that
the
thing
acted
should
be
as
powerful
as
the
thing
itself
;
 
perhaps
even
more
powerful
?
<EOS>
Poor
Lizzie
Eustace
!
<EOS>
In
thinking
over
all
this
,
she
saw
a
great
deal
.
<EOS>
It
was
wonderful
that
she
should
see
so
much
and
tell
herself
so
many
home
truths
.
<EOS>
But
there
was
one
truth
she
could
not
see
,
and
therefore
could
not
tell
it
to
herself
.
<EOS>
She
had
not
a
heart
to
give
.
<EOS>
It
had
become
petrified
during
those
lessons
of
early
craft
in
which
she
had
taught
herself
how
to
get
the
better
of
Messrs.
Harter
and
Benjamin
,
of
Sir
Florian
Eustace
,
of
Lady
Linlithgow
,
and
of
Mr.
Camperdown
.
  
<EOS>
Her
ladyship
had
now
come
down
to
her
country
house
,
leaving
London
and
all
its
charms
before
the
end
of
the
season
,
actuated
by
various
motives
.
<EOS>
In
the
first
place
,
the
house
in
Mount
Street
was
taken
furnished
,
by
the
month
,
and
the
servants
were
hired
after
the
same
fashion
,
and
the
horses
jobbed
.
<EOS>
Lady
Eustace
was
already
sufficiently
intimate
with
her
accounts
to
know
that
she
would
save
two
hundred
pounds
by
not
remaining
another
month
or
three
weeks
in
London
,
and
sufficiently
observant
of
her
own
affairs
to
have
perceived
that
such
saving
was
needed
.
<EOS>
And
then
it
appeared
to
her
that
her
battle
with
Lord
Fawn
could
be
better
fought
from
a
distance
than
at
close
quarters
.
<EOS>
London
,
too
,
was
becoming
absolutely
distasteful
to
her
.
<EOS>
There
were
many
things
there
that
tended
to
make
her
unhappy
,
and
so
few
that
she
could
enjoy
!
<EOS>
She
was
afraid
of
Mr.
Camperdown
,
and
ever
on
the
rack
lest
some
dreadful
thing
should
come
upon
her
in
respect
of
the
necklace
,
 
some
horrible
paper
served
upon
her
from
a
magistrate
,
ordering
her
appearance
at
Newgate
,
or
perhaps
before
the
Lord
Chancellor
,
or
a
visit
from
policemen
,
who
would
be
empowered
to
search
for
and
carry
off
the
iron
box
.
<EOS>
And
then
there
was
so
little
in
her
London
life
to
gratify
her
!
<EOS>
It
is
pleasant
to
win
in
a
fight
;
 
but
to
be
always
fighting
is
not
pleasant
.
<EOS>
Except
in
those
moments
,
few
and
far
between
,
in
which
she
was
alone
with
her
cousin
Frank
,
 
and
perhaps
in
those
other
moments
in
which
she
wore
her
diamonds
,
 
she
had
but
little
in
London
that
she
enjoyed
.
<EOS>
She
still
thought
that
a
time
would
come
when
it
would
be
otherwise
.
<EOS>
Under
these
influences
she
had
actually
made
herself
believe
that
she
was
sighing
for
the
country
,
and
for
solitude
;
for
the
wide
expanse
of
her
own
bright
waves
,
 
as
she
had
called
them
,
 
and
for
the
rocks
of
dear
Portray
.
<EOS>
She
had
told
Miss
Macnulty
and
Augusta
Fawn
that
she
thirsted
for
the
breezes
of
Ayrshire
,
so
that
she
might
return
to
her
books
and
her
thoughts
.
<EOS>
Amidst
the
whirl
of
London
it
was
impossible
either
to
read
or
to
think
.
<EOS>
And
she
believed
it
too
,
 
herself
.
<EOS>
She
so
believed
it
,
that
on
the
first
morning
of
her
arrival
she
took
a
little
volume
in
her
pocket
,
containing
Shelley
's
"
Queen
Mab
,
"
and
essayed
to
go
down
upon
the
rocks
.
<EOS>
She
had
actually
breakfasted
at
nine
,
and
was
out
on
the
sloping
grounds
below
the
castle
before
ten
,
having
made
some
boast
to
Miss
Macnulty
about
the
morning
air
.
  
<EOS>
She
scrambled
down
,
 
not
very
far
down
,
but
a
little
way
beneath
the
garden
gate
,
to
a
spot
on
which
a
knob
of
rock
cropped
out
from
the
scanty
herbage
of
the
incipient
cliff
.
<EOS>
Fifty
yards
lower
the
real
rocks
began
;
and
,
though
the
real
rocks
were
not
very
rocky
,
not
precipitous
or
even
bold
,
and
were
partially
covered
with
salt
-
fed
mosses
down
almost
to
the
sea
,
nevertheless
they
justified
her
in
talking
about
her
rock
-
bound
shore
.
<EOS>
The
shore
was
hers
,
 
for
her
life
,
and
it
was
rock
-
bound
.
<EOS>
This
knob
she
had
espied
from
her
windows
;
 
and
,
indeed
,
had
been
thinking
of
it
for
the
last
week
,
as
a
place
appropriate
to
solitude
and
Shelley
.
<EOS>
She
had
stood
on
it
before
,
and
had
stretched
her
arms
with
enthusiasm
towards
the
just
-
visible
mountains
of
Arran
.
<EOS>
On
that
occasion
the
weather
,
perhaps
,
had
been
cool
;
but
now
a
blazing
sun
was
overhead
,
and
when
she
had
been
seated
half
a
minute
,
and
"
Queen
Mab
"
had
been
withdrawn
from
her
pocket
,
she
found
that
it
would
not
do
.
<EOS>
It
would
not
do
,
even
with
the
canopy
she
could
make
for
herself
with
her
parasol
.
<EOS>
So
she
stood
up
and
looked
about
herself
for
shade
;
 
for
shade
in
some
spot
in
which
she
could
still
look
out
upon
"
her
dear
wide
ocean
,
with
its
glittering
smile
.
<EOS>
"
For
it
was
thus
that
she
would
talk
about
the
mouth
of
the
Clyde
.
<EOS>
Shelter
near
her
there
was
none
.
<EOS>
The
scrubby
trees
lay
nearly
half
a
mile
to
the
right
,
 
and
up
the
hill
,
too
.
<EOS>
She
had
once
clambered
down
to
the
actual
shore
,
and
might
do
so
again
.
<EOS>
But
she
doubted
that
there
would
be
shelter
even
there
;
and
the
clambering
up
on
that
former
occasion
had
been
a
nuisance
,
and
would
be
a
worse
nuisance
now
.
<EOS>
Thinking
of
all
this
,
and
feeling
the
sun
keenly
,
she
gradually
retraced
her
steps
to
the
garden
within
the
moat
,
and
seated
herself
,
Shelley
in
hand
,
within
the
summer
-
house
.
<EOS>
The
bench
was
narrow
,
hard
,
and
broken
;
and
there
were
some
snails
which
discomposed
her
;
 
but
,
nevertheless
,
she
would
make
the
best
of
it
.
<EOS>
Her
darling
"
Queen
Mab
"
must
be
read
without
the
coarse
,
inappropriate
,
every
-
day
surroundings
of
a
drawing
-
room
;
and
it
was
now
manifest
to
her
that
,
unless
she
could
get
up
much
earlier
in
the
morning
,
or
come
out
to
her
reading
after
sunset
,
the
knob
of
rock
would
not
avail
her
.
  
<EOS>
She
began
her
reading
,
resolved
that
she
would
enjoy
her
poetry
in
spite
of
the
narrow
seat
.
<EOS>
She
had
often
talked
of
"
Queen
Mab
,
"
and
perhaps
she
thought
she
had
read
it
.
<EOS>
This
,
however
,
was
in
truth
her
first
attempt
at
that
work
.
<EOS>
"
How
wonderful
is
Death
!
<EOS>
Death
and
his
brother
,
Sleep
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Then
she
half
-
closed
the
volume
,
and
thought
that
she
enjoyed
the
idea
.
<EOS>
Death
,
 
and
his
brother
Sleep
!
<EOS>
She
did
not
know
why
they
should
be
more
wonderful
than
Action
,
or
Life
,
or
Thought
;
 
but
the
words
were
of
a
nature
which
would
enable
her
to
remember
them
,
and
they
would
be
good
for
quoting
.
"
<EOS>
Sudden
arose
Ianthe
's
soul
;
it
stood
all
-
beautiful
in
naked
purity
.
<EOS>
"
The
name
of
Ianthe
suited
her
exactly
.
<EOS>
And
the
antithesis
conveyed
to
her
mind
by
naked
purity
struck
her
strongly
,
and
she
determined
to
learn
the
passage
by
heart
.
<EOS>
Eight
or
nine
lines
were
printed
separately
,
like
a
stanza
,
and
the
labour
would
not
be
great
,
and
the
task
,
when
done
,
would
be
complete
.
<EOS>
"
Instinct
with
inexpressible
beauty
and
grace
,
Each
stain
of
earthliness
Had
passed
away
,
it
reassumed
Its
native
dignity
,
and
stood
Immortal
amid
ruin
.
<EOS>
"
Which
was
instinct
with
beauty
,
 
the
stain
or
the
soul
,
she
did
not
stop
to
inquire
,
and
may
be
excused
for
not
understanding
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
,
"
 
she
exclaimed
to
herself
,
"
how
true
it
is
;
how
one
feels
it
;
how
it
comes
home
to
one
!
 
<EOS>
"
Sudden
arose
Ianthe
's
soul
!
"
<EOS>
"
And
then
she
walked
about
the
garden
,
repeating
the
words
to
herself
,
and
almost
forgetting
the
heat
.
"
<EOS>
"
Each
stain
of
earthliness
had
passed
away
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ha
;
 
yes
.
<EOS>
They
will
pass
away
,
and
become
instinct
with
beauty
and
grace
.
<EOS>
"
A
dim
idea
came
upon
her
that
when
this
happy
time
should
arrive
,
no
one
would
claim
her
necklace
from
her
,
and
that
the
man
at
the
stables
would
not
be
so
disagreeably
punctual
in
sending
in
his
bill
.
"
<EOS>
"
All
-
beautiful
in
naked
purity
!

What
a
tawdry
world
was
this
,
in
which
clothes
and
food
and
houses
are
necessary
!
<EOS>
How
perfectly
that
boy
-
poet
had
understood
it
all
!
"
<EOS>
"
Immortal
amid
ruin
!
"
<EOS>
"
She
liked
the
idea
of
the
ruin
almost
as
well
as
that
of
the
immortality
,
and
the
stains
quite
as
well
as
the
purity
.
<EOS>
As
immortality
must
come
,
and
as
stains
were
instinct
with
grace
,
why
be
afraid
of
ruin
?
<EOS>
But
then
,
if
people
go
wrong
,
 
at
least
women
,
 
they
are
not
asked
out
any
where
!
"
<EOS>
"
Sudden
arose
Ianthe
's
soul
;
it
stood
all
-
beautiful
 
"
"
<EOS>
And
so
the
piece
was
learned
,
and
Lizzie
felt
that
she
had
devoted
her
hour
to
poetry
in
a
quite
rapturous
manner
.
<EOS>
At
any
rate
she
had
a
bit
to
quote
;
and
though
in
truth
she
did
not
understand
the
exact
bearing
of
the
image
,
she
had
so
studied
her
gestures
,
and
so
modulated
her
voice
,
that
she
knew
that
she
could
be
effective
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
then
care
to
carry
her
reading
further
,
but
returned
with
the
volume
into
the
house
.
<EOS>
Though
the
passage
about
Ianthe
's
soul
comes
very
early
in
the
work
,
she
was
now
quite
familiar
with
the
poem
,
and
when
,
in
after
days
,
she
spoke
of
it
as
a
thing
of
beauty
that
she
had
made
her
own
by
long
study
,
she
actually
did
not
know
that
she
was
lying
.
<EOS>
As
she
grew
older
,
however
,
she
quickly
became
wiser
,
and
was
aware
<EOS>
that
in
learning
one
passage
of
a
poem
it
is
expedient
to
select
one
in
the
middle
,
or
at
the
end
.
<EOS>
The
world
is
so
cruelly
observant
now
-
a
-
days
,
that
even
men
and
women
who
have
not
themselves
read
their
"
Queen
Mab
"
will
know
from
what
part
of
the
poem
a
morsel
is
extracted
,
and
will
not
give
you
credit
for
a
page
beyond
that
from
which
your
passage
comes
.
  
<EOS>
After
lunch
Lizzie
invited
Miss
Macnulty
to
sit
at
the
open
window
of
the
drawing
-
room
and
look
out
upon
the
"
glittering
waves
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
In
giving
Miss
Macnulty
her
due
,
we
must
acknowledge
that
,
though
she
owned
no
actual
cleverness
herself
,
had
no
cultivated
tastes
,
read
but
little
,
and
that
little
of
a
colourless
kind
,
and
thought
nothing
of
her
hours
but
that
she
might
get
rid
of
them
and
live
,
 
<EOS>
yet
she
had
a
certain
power
of
insight
,
and
could
see
a
thing
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
Eustace
was
utterly
powerless
to
impose
upon
her
.
<EOS>
Such
as
Lizzie
was
,
Miss
Macnulty
was
willing
to
put
up
with
her
and
accept
her
bread
.
<EOS>
The
people
whom
she
had
known
had
been
either
worthless
,
 
as
had
been
her
own
father
,
or
cruel
,
 
like
Lady
Linlithgow
,
or
false
,
 
as
was
Lady
Eustace
.
<EOS>
Miss
Macnulty
knew
that
worthlessness
,
cruelty
,
and
falseness
had
to
be
endured
by
such
as
she
.
<EOS>
And
she
could
bear
them
without
caring
much
about
them
;
 
not
condemning
them
,
even
within
her
own
heart
,
very
heavily
.
<EOS>
But
she
was
strangely
deficient
in
this
,
 
that
she
could
not
call
these
qualities
by
other
names
,
even
to
the
owners
of
them
.
<EOS>
She
was
unable
to
pretend
to
believe
Lizzie
's
rhapsodies
.
<EOS>
It
was
hardly
conscience
or
a
grand
spirit
of
truth
that
actuated
her
,
as
much
as
a
want
of
the
courage
needed
for
lying
.
<EOS>
She
had
not
had
the
face
to
call
old
Lady
Linlithgow
kind
,
and
therefore
old
Lady
Linlithgow
had
turned
her
out
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
When
Lady
Eustace
called
on
her
for
sympathy
,
she
had
not
courage
enough
to
dare
to
attempt
the
bit
of
acting
which
would
be
necessary
for
sympathetic
expression
.
<EOS>
She
was
like
a
dog
or
a
child
,
and
was
unable
not
to
be
true
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
was
longing
for
a
little
mock
sympathy
,
 
was
longing
to
show
off
her
Shelley
,
and
was
very
kind
to
Miss
Macnulty
when
she
got
the
poor
lady
into
the
recess
of
the
window
.
<EOS>
"
This
is
nice
;
 
is
it
not
?
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
as
she
spread
her
hand
out
through
the
open
space
towards
the
"
wide
expanse
of
glittering
waves
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
nice
,
 
only
it
glares
so
,
"
said
Miss
Macnulty
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
I
love
the
full
warmth
of
the
real
summer
.
<EOS>
With
me
it
always
seems
that
the
sun
is
needed
to
bring
to
true
ripeness
the
fruit
of
the
heart
.
<EOS>
"
Nevertheless
she
had
been
much
troubled
both
by
the
heat
and
by
the
midges
when
she
tried
to
sit
on
the
stone
.
<EOS>
"
I
always
think
of
those
few
glorious
days
which
I
passed
with
my
darling
Florian
at
Naples
;
 
days
too
glorious
because
they
were
so
few
.
"
<EOS>
Now
Miss
Macnulty
knew
some
of
the
history
of
those
days
and
of
their
glory
,
 
and
knew
also
how
the
widow
had
borne
her
loss
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
the
bay
of
Naples
is
fine
,
"
she
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
only
the
bay
.
<EOS>
There
are
scenes
there
which
ravish
you
,
only
it
is
necessary
that
there
should
be
some
one
with
you
that
can
understand
you
.
"
<EOS>
Soul
of
Ianthe
!
"
<EOS>
"
she
said
,
meaning
to
apostrophise
that
of
the
deceased
Sir
Florian
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
read
"
Queen
Mab
"
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
that
I
ever
did
.
<EOS>
If
I
have
,
I
have
forgotten
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
 
you
should
read
it
.
<EOS>
I
know
nothing
in
the
English
language
that
brings
home
to
one
so
often
one
's
own
best
feelings
and
aspirations
.
<EOS>
"
It
stands
all
-
beautiful
in
naked
purity
,
"
"
she
continued
,
still
alluding
to
poor
Sir
Florian
's
soul
.
"
<EOS>
"
Instinct
with
inexpressible
beauty
and
grace
,
Each
stain
of
earthliness
had
passed
away
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
see
him
now
in
all
his
manly
beauty
,
as
we
used
to
sit
together
by
the
hour
,
looking
over
the
waters
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
Julia
,
the
thing
itself
has
gone
,
 
the
earthly
reality
;
but
the
memory
of
it
will
live
for
ever
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
was
a
very
handsome
man
,
certainly
,
"
said
Miss
Macnulty
,
finding
herself
forced
to
say
something
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
see
him
now
,
"
she
went
on
,
still
gazing
out
upon
the
shining
water
.
"
<EOS>
"
It
reassumed
its
native
dignity
,
and
stood
Primeval
amid
ruin
.
"
Is
not
that
a
glorious
idea
,
gloriously
worded
?
"
<EOS>
She
had
forgotten
one
word
and
used
a
wrong
epithet
;
but
it
sounded
just
as
well
.
<EOS>
Primeval
seemed
to
her
to
be
a
very
poetical
word
.
  
<EOS>
"
To
tell
the
truth
,
"
said
Miss
Macnulty
,
<EOS>
"
I
never
understand
poetry
when
it
is
quoted
unless
I
happen
to
know
the
passage
beforehand
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
'll
go
away
from
this
,
for
the
light
is
too
much
for
my
poor
old
eyes
.
"
<EOS>
Certainly
Miss
Macnulty
had
fallen
into
a
profession
for
which
she
was
not
suited
.
   
<EOS>
Lady
Eustace
Procures
a
Pony
for
the
Use
of
Her
Cousin
 
<EOS>
Lady
Eustace
could
make
nothing
of
Miss
Macnulty
in
the
way
of
sympathy
,
and
could
not
bear
her
disappointment
with
patience
.
<EOS>
It
was
hardly
to
be
expected
that
she
should
do
so
.
<EOS>
She
paid
a
great
deal
for
Miss
Macnulty
.
<EOS>
In
a
moment
of
rash
generosity
,
and
at
a
time
when
she
hardly
knew
what
money
meant
,
she
had
promised
Miss
Macnulty
seventy
pounds
for
the
first
year
,
and
seventy
for
the
second
,
should
the
arrangement
last
longer
than
a
twelvemonth
.
<EOS>
The
second
year
had
been
now
commenced
,
and
Lady
Eustace
was
beginning
to
think
that
seventy
pounds
was
a
great
deal
of
money
when
so
very
little
was
given
in
return
.
<EOS>
Lady
Linlithgow
had
paid
her
dependant
no
fixed
salary
.
<EOS>
And
then
there
was
the
lady
's
"
keep
,
"
and
first
-
class
travelling
when
they
went
up
and
down
to
Scotland
,
and
cab
-
fares
in
London
when
it
was
desirable
that
Miss
Macnulty
should
absent
herself
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
,
reckoning
all
up
,
and
thinking
that
for
so
much
her
friend
ought
to
be
ready
to
discuss
Ianthe
's
soul
,
or
any
other
kindred
subject
,
at
a
moment
's
warning
,
would
become
angry
,
and
would
tell
herself
that
she
was
being
swindled
out
of
her
money
.
<EOS>
She
knew
how
necessary
it
was
that
she
should
have
some
companion
at
the
present
emergency
of
her
life
,
and
therefore
could
not
at
once
send
Miss
Macnulty
away
;
but
she
would
sometimes
become
very
cross
,
and
would
tell
poor
Macnulty
that
she
was
 
a
fool
.
<EOS>
Upon
the
whole
,
however
,
to
be
called
a
fool
was
less
objectionable
to
Miss
Macnulty
than
were
demands
for
sympathy
which
she
did
not
know
how
to
give
.
  
<EOS>
Those
first
ten
days
of
August
went
very
slowly
with
Lady
Eustace
.
"
<EOS>
Queen
Mab
"
got
itself
poked
away
,
and
was
heard
of
no
more
.
<EOS>
But
there
were
other
books
.
<EOS>
A
huge
box
full
of
novels
had
come
down
,
and
Miss
Macnulty
was
a
great
devourer
of
novels
.
<EOS>
If
Lady
Eustace
would
talk
to
her
about
the
sorrows
of
the
poorest
heroine
that
ever
saw
her
lover
murdered
before
her
eyes
,
and
then
come
to
life
again
with
ten
thousand
pounds
a
year
,
 
for
a
period
of
three
weeks
,
or
till
another
heroine
,
<EOS>
who
had
herself
been
murdered
,
obliterated
the
former
horrors
from
her
plastic
mind
,
 
Miss
Macnulty
could
discuss
the
catastrophe
with
the
keenest
interest
.
<EOS>
And
Lizzie
,
finding
herself
to
be
,
as
she
told
herself
,
unstrung
,
fell
also
into
novel
-
reading
.
<EOS>
She
had
intended
during
this
vacant
time
to
master
the
"
Faery
Queen
;
"
but
the
"
Faery
Queen
"
fared
even
worse
than
"
Queen
Mab
;
"
 
and
the
studies
of
Portray
Castle
were
confined
to
novels
.
<EOS>
For
poor
Macnulty
,
if
she
could
only
be
left
alone
,
this
was
well
enough
.
<EOS>
To
have
her
meals
,
and
her
daily
walk
,
and
her
fill
of
novels
,
and
to
be
left
alone
,
was
all
that
she
asked
of
the
gods
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
not
so
with
Lady
Eustace
.
<EOS>
She
asked
much
more
than
that
,
and
was
now
thoroughly
discontented
with
her
own
idleness
.
<EOS>
She
was
sure
that
she
could
have
read
Spenser
from
sunrise
to
sundown
,
with
no
other
break
than
an
hour
or
two
given
to
Shelley
,
 
if
only
there
had
been
some
one
to
sympathise
with
her
in
her
readings
.
<EOS>
But
there
was
no
one
,
and
she
was
very
cross
.
<EOS>
Then
there
came
a
letter
to
her
from
her
cousin
,
 
which
for
that
morning
brought
some
life
back
to
the
castle
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
seen
Lord
Fawn
,
"
said
the
letter
,
"
and
I
have
also
seen
Mr.
Camperdown
.
<EOS>
As
it
would
be
very
hard
to
explain
what
took
place
at
these
interviews
by
letter
,
and
as
I
shall
be
at
Portray
Castle
on
the
20th
,
 
I
will
not
make
the
attempt
.
<EOS>
We
shall
go
down
by
the
night
train
,
and
I
will
get
over
to
you
as
soon
as
I
have
dressed
and
had
my
breakfast
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
I
can
find
some
kind
of
a
pony
for
the
journey
.
<EOS>
The
"
we
"
consists
of
myself
and
my
friend
,
Mr.
Herriot
,
 
a
man
whom
I
think
you
will
like
,
if
you
will
condescend
to
see
him
,
though
he
is
a
barrister
like
myself
.
<EOS>
You
need
express
no
immediate
condescension
in
his
favour
,
as
I
shall
of
course
come
over
alone
on
Wednesday
morning
.
<EOS>
Yours
always
affectionately
,
F.
G.
"
  
The
letter
she
received
on
the
Sunday
morning
,
and
as
the
Wednesday
named
for
Frank
's
coming
was
the
next
Wednesday
,
and
was
close
at
hand
,
she
was
in
rather
a
better
humour
than
she
had
displayed
since
the
poets
had
failed
her
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
a
blessing
it
will
be
,
"
she
said
,
"
to
have
somebody
to
speak
to
!
"
  
<EOS>
This
was
not
complimentary
,
but
Miss
Macnulty
did
not
want
compliments
.
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
indeed
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
Of
course
you
will
be
glad
to
see
your
cousin
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
glad
to
see
anything
in
the
shape
of
a
man
.
<EOS>
I
declare
that
I
have
felt
almost
inclined
to
ask
the
minister
from
Craigie
to
elope
with
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
has
got
seven
children
,
"
said
Miss
Macnulty
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
poor
man
,
and
a
wife
,
and
not
more
than
enough
to
live
upon
.
<EOS>
I
daresay
he
would
have
come
.
<EOS>
By
-
the
-
bye
,
I
wonder
whether
there
's
a
pony
about
the
place
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
pony
!
"
<EOS>
Miss
Macnulty
of
course
supposed
that
it
was
needed
for
the
purpose
of
the
suggested
elopement
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
 
I
suppose
you
know
what
a
pony
is
?
<EOS>
Of
course
there
ought
to
be
a
shooting
pony
at
the
cottage
for
these
men
.
<EOS>
My
poor
head
has
so
many
things
to
work
upon
that
I
had
forgotten
it
;
and
you
're
never
any
good
at
thinking
of
things
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
know
that
gentlemen
wanted
ponies
for
shooting
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
what
you
do
know
?
<EOS>
Of
course
there
must
be
a
pony
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
you
'll
want
two
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
sha'n't
.
<EOS>
You
do
n't
suppose
that
men
always
go
riding
about
.
<EOS>
But
I
want
one
.
<EOS>
What
had
I
better
do
?
"
<EOS>
Miss
Macnulty
suggested
that
Gowran
should
be
consulted
.
<EOS>
Now
,
Gowran
was
the
steward
and
bailiff
and
manager
and
factotum
about
the
place
,
who
bought
a
cow
or
sold
one
if
occasion
required
,
and
saw
that
nobody
stole
anything
,
and
who
knew
the
boundaries
of
the
farms
,
and
all
about
the
tenants
,
and
looked
after
the
pipes
when
frost
came
,
and
was
an
honest
,
domineering
,
hard
-
working
,
intelligent
Scotchman
,
who
had
been
brought
up
to
love
the
Eustaces
,
and
who
hated
his
present
mistress
with
all
his
heart
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
leave
her
service
,
having
an
idea
in
his
mind
that
it
was
now
the
great
duty
of
his
life
to
save
Portray
from
her
ravages
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
fully
returned
the
compliment
of
the
hatred
,
and
was
determined
to
rid
herself
of
Andy
Gowran
's
services
as
soon
as
possible
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
called
Andy
by
the
late
Sir
Florian
,
and
,
though
every
one
else
about
the
place
called
him
Mr.
Gowran
,
Lady
Eustace
thought
it
became
her
,
as
the
man
's
mistress
,
to
treat
him
as
he
had
been
treated
by
the
late
master
.
<EOS>
So
she
called
him
Andy
.
<EOS>
But
she
was
resolved
to
get
rid
of
him
,
 
as
soon
as
she
should
dare
.
<EOS>
There
were
things
which
it
was
essential
that
somebody
about
the
place
should
know
,
and
no
one
knew
them
but
Mr.
Gowran
.
<EOS>
Every
servant
in
the
castle
might
rob
her
,
were
it
not
for
the
protection
afforded
by
Mr.
Gowran
.
<EOS>
In
that
affair
of
the
garden
it
was
Mr.
Gowran
who
had
enabled
her
to
conquer
the
horticultural
Leviathan
who
had
oppressed
her
,
and
who
,
in
point
of
wages
,
had
been
a
much
bigger
man
than
Mr.
Gowran
himself
.
<EOS>
She
trusted
Mr.
Gowran
,
and
hated
him
,
 
whereas
Mr.
Gowran
hated
her
,
and
did
not
trust
her
.
<EOS>
"
I
believe
you
think
that
nothing
can
be
done
at
Portray
except
by
that
man
,
"
said
Lady
Eustace
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
'll
know
how
much
you
ought
to
pay
for
the
pony
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Yes
,
 
and
get
some
brute
not
fit
for
my
cousin
to
ride
,
on
purpose
,
perhaps
,
to
break
his
neck
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
I
should
ask
Mr.
Macallum
,
the
postmaster
of
Troon
,
for
I
have
seen
three
or
four
<EOS>
very
quiet
-
looking
ponies
standing
in
the
carts
at
his
door
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Macnulty
,
if
there
ever
was
an
idiot
you
are
one
!
"
said
Lady
Eustace
,
throwing
up
her
hands
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
To
think
that
I
should
get
a
pony
for
my
cousin
Frank
out
of
one
of
the
mail
carts
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
daresay
I
am
an
idiot
,
"
said
Miss
Macnulty
,
resuming
her
novel
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Eustace
was
,
of
course
,
obliged
to
have
recourse
to
Gowran
,
to
whom
she
applied
on
the
Monday
morning
.
<EOS>
Not
even
Lizzie
Eustace
,
on
behalf
of
her
cousin
Frank
,
would
have
dared
to
disturb
Mr.
Gowran
with
considerations
respecting
a
pony
on
the
Sabbath
.
<EOS>
On
the
Monday
morning
she
found
Mr.
Gowran
superintending
four
boys
and
three
old
women
,
who
were
making
a
bit
of
her
ladyship
's
hay
on
the
ground
above
the
castle
.
<EOS>
The
ground
about
the
castle
was
poor
and
exposed
,
and
her
ladyship
's
hay
was
apt
to
be
late
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Andy
,
"
she
said
,
"
I
shall
want
to
get
a
pony
for
the
gentlemen
who
are
coming
to
the
Cottage
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
there
by
Tuesday
evening
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
pownie
,
my
leddie
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
;
 
a
pony
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
a
pony
may
be
purchased
in
Ayrshire
,
 
though
of
all
places
in
the
world
it
seems
to
have
the
fewest
of
the
comforts
of
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Them
as
find
it
like
that
,
my
leddie
,
need
n't
bide
there
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Never
mind
.
<EOS>
You
will
have
the
kindness
to
have
a
pony
purchased
and
put
into
the
stables
of
the
Cottage
on
Tuesday
afternoon
.
<EOS>
There
are
stables
,
no
doubt
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
ay
,
 
there
's
shelter
,
nae
doot
,
for
mair
pownies
than
they
'll
ride
.
<EOS>
When
the
Cottage
was
biggit
,
my
leddie
,
there
was
nae
cause
for
sparing
nowt
.
"
<EOS>
Andy
Gowran
was
continually
throwing
her
comparative
poverty
in
poor
Lizzie
's
teeth
,
and
there
was
nothing
he
could
do
which
displeased
her
more
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
need
n't
spare
my
cousin
the
use
of
a
pony
,
"
she
said
grandiloquently
,
but
feeling
as
she
did
so
that
she
was
exposing
herself
before
the
man
.
<EOS>
"
You
'll
have
the
goodness
to
procure
one
for
him
on
Tuesday
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
But
there
ai
n't
aits
nor
yet
fother
,
nor
nowt
for
bedding
down
.
<EOS>
And
wha
's
to
tent
the
pownie
?
<EOS>
There
's
mair
in
keeping
a
pownie
than
your
leddyship
thinks
.
<EOS>
It
'll
be
a
matter
of
auchteen

saxpence
a
week
,
 
will
a
pownie
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Gowran
,
as
he
expressed
his
prudential
scruples
,
put
a
very
strong
emphasis
indeed
on
the
sixpence
.
  
<EOS>
"
Very
well
.
<EOS>
Let
it
be
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
there
'll
be
the
beastie
to
buy
,
my
leddie
.
<EOS>
He
'll
be
a
lump
of
money
,
my
leddie
.
<EOS>
Pownies
ai
n't

be
had
for

in
Ayrshire
,
as
was
ance
,
my
leddie

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
I
must
pay
for
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
'll
be
a
matter
of
ten
pound
,
my
leddie
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Or
may
be
twal
;
just
as
likely
.
"
<EOS>
And
Mr.
Gowran
shook
his
head
at
his
mistress
in
a
most
uncomfortable
way
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
surprising
that
she
should
hate
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
give
the
proper
price
,
 
of
course
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
ai
n't
no
proper
prices
for
pownies
,
 
as
there
is
for
jew'ls
and
sich
like
.
<EOS>
"
If
this
was
intended
for
sarcasm
upon
Lady
Eustace
in
regard
to
her
diamonds
,
Mr.
Gowran
ought
to
have
been
dismissed
on
the
spot
.
<EOS>
In
such
a
case
no
English
jury
would
have
given
him
his
current
wages
.
"
<EOS>
And
he
'll
be
to
sell
again
,
my
leddie
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
shall
see
about
that
afterwards
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ye'll
never
let
him
eat
his
head
off
there
a
'
the

<EOS>
He
'll
be

<EOS>
And
the

him

<EOS>
ance
across

,
out
and
back

<EOS>
As
to
the
grouse
,
they
ca
n't
cotch
them
with
the
pownie
,
for
there
ai
n't
none
to
cotch

<EOS>
"
There
had
been
two
keepers
on
the
mountains
,
 
men
who
were
paid
five
or
six
shillings
a
week
to
look
after
the
game
in
addition
to
their
other
callings
,
and
one
of
these
had
been
sent
away
,
actually
in
obedience
to
Gowran
's
advice
;
 
so
that
this
blow
was
cruel
and
unmanly
.
<EOS>
He
made
it
,
too
,
as
severe
as
he
could
by
another
shake
of
his
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
my
cousin
can
not
be
supplied
with
an

ride
upon

"
  
<EOS>
"
My

"
A
what
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
can
be
no
doubt
that
Gowran
purposely
slurred
the
word
so
that
his
mistress
should
not
understand
him
.
<EOS>
"
Seddles

n't

<EOS>
"
A

said
he
,
shouting
the
word
at
her
at
the
top

"
and
a
briddle
.
<EOS>
I

back
up
in
Lunnon

"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
there
must
be
the
necessary
horse
-
furniture

"
said
Lady
Eustace
,
retiring
to
the
castle
.
<EOS>
Andy
Gowran
had
certainly
ill
-
used
her
,
and
she
swore
that
she
would
have
revenge
.
<EOS>
Nor
when
she
was
informed
on
the
Tuesday
that
an
adequate
pony
had
been
hired
for
eighteen
pence
a
day
,
saddle
,
bridle
,
groom
,
and
all
included

was
her
heart

Frank
Greystock
's
First
Visit
to
Portray
 
Had
<EOS>
Frank
Greystock
known
all
that
his
cousin
endured
for
his
comfort
,
would
he
have
been
grateful
?
<EOS>
Women
,
when
they
are
fond
of
men
,
do
think
much
of
men
's
comfort
in
small
matters
,
and
men
are
apt
to
take
the
good
things
provided
almost
as
a
matter
of
course
.
<EOS>
When
Frank
Greystock
and
Herriot
reached
the
cottage
about
nine
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
having
left
London
over
night
by
the
limited
mail
train
,
the
pony
at
once
presented
itself
to
them
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
little
shaggy
,
black
beast
,
with
a
boy
almost
as
shaggy
as
itself
,
but
they
were
both
good
of
their
kind
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
you
're
the
laddie
with
the
pownie
,
are
you
?
"
<EOS>
said
Frank
,
in
answer
to
an
announcement
made
to
him
by
the
boy
.
<EOS>
He
did
at
once
perceive
that
Lizzie
had
taken
notice
of
the
word
in
his
note
,
in
which
he
had
suggested
that
some
means
of
getting
over
to
Portray
would
be
needed
,
and
he
learned
from
the
fact
that
she
was
thinking
of
him
and
anxious
to
see
him
.
  
<EOS>
His
friend
was
a
man
a
couple
of
years
younger
than
himself
,
who
had
hitherto
<EOS>
achieved
no
success
at
the
Bar
,
but
who
was
nevertheless
a
clever
,
diligent
,
well
-
instructed
man
.
<EOS>
He
was
what
the
world
calls
penniless
,
having
an
income
from
his
father
just
sufficient
to
keep
him
like
a
gentleman
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
much
known
as
a
sportsman
,
his
opportunities
for
shooting
not
having
been
great
;
but
he
dearly
loved
the
hills
and
fresh
air
,
and
the
few
grouse
which
were
,
 
or
were
not
,
 
on
Lady
Eustace
's
mountains
would
go
as
far
with
him
as
they
would
with
any
man
.
<EOS>
Before
he
had
consented
to
come
with
Frank
,
he
had
especially
inquired
whether
there
was
a
game
-
keeper
,
and
it
was
not
till
he
had
been
assured
that
there
was
no
officer
attached
to
the
estate
worthy
of
such
a
name
,
that
he
had
consented
to
come
upon
his
present
expedition
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
clearly
know
what
a
gillie
is
,
"
he
said
,
in
answer
to
one
of
Frank
's
explanations
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
If
a
gillie
means
a
lad
without
any
breeches
on
,
I
do
n't
mind
;
but
I
could
n't
stand
a
severe
man
got
up
in
well
-
made
velveteens
,
who
would
see
through
my
ignorance
in
a
moment
,
and
make
known
by
comment
the
fact
that
he
had
done
so
.
<EOS>
"
Greystock
had
promised
that
there
should
be
no
severity
,
and
Herriot
had
come
.
<EOS>
Greystock
brought
with
him
two
guns
,
two
fishing
-
rods
,
a
man
-
servant
,
and
a
huge
hamper
from
Fortnum
and
Mason
's
.
<EOS>
Arthur
Herriot
,
whom
the
attorneys
had
not
yet
loved
,
brought
some
very
thick
boots
,
a
pair
of
knickerbockers
,
together
with
Stone
and
Toddy
's
"
Digest
of
the
Common
Law
.
<EOS>
"
The
best
of
the
legal
profession
consists
in
this
;
 
that
when
you
get
fairly
at
work
you
may
give
over
working
.
<EOS>
An
aspirant
must
learn
everything
;
but
a
man
may
make
his
fortune
at
it
,
and
know
almost
nothing
.
<EOS>
He
may
examine
a
witness
with
judgment
,
see
through
a
case
with
precision
,
address
a
jury
with
eloquence
,
 
and
yet
be
altogether
ignorant
of
law
.
<EOS>
But
he
must
be
believed
to
be
a
very
pundit
before
he
will
get
a
chance
of
exercising
his
judgment
,
his
precision
,
or
his
eloquence
.
<EOS>
The
men
whose
names
are
always
in
the
newspapers
never
look
at
their
Stone
and
Toddy
,
 
care
for
it
not
at
all
,
 
have
their
Stone
and
Toddy
got
up
for
them
by
their
juniors
when
cases
require
that
reference
shall
be
made
to
precedents
.
<EOS>
But
till
that
blessed
time
has
come
,
a
barrister
who
means
success
should
carry
his
Stone
and
Toddy
with
him
everywhere
.
<EOS>
Greystock
never
thought
of
the
law
now
,
unless
he
had
some
special
case
in
hand
;
but
Herriot
could
not
afford
to
go
out
on
his
holiday
without
two
volumes
of
Stone
and
Toddy
's
Digest
in
his
portmanteau
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
wo
n't

left
alone
for

said
Frank
,
as
soon
as
they
had
finished
the
contents
of
one
of
the
pots
from
Fortnum
and
Mason
.

Not

<EOS>
"
Perhaps
I
will
take
a
turn
,
 
just
to
find
out
how
I
feel
in
the
knickerbockers
.
<EOS>
At
what
time
shall
I
dine
if
you
do
n't
come
back
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
certainly
be
here
to
dinner
,
"
said
Frank
,
"
unless
the
pony
fails
me
or
I
get
lost
on
the
mountain
.
<EOS>
"
Then
he
started
,
and
Herriot
at
once
went
to
work
on
Stone
and
Toddy
,
with
a
pipe
in
his
mouth
.
<EOS>
He
had
travelled
all
night
,
and
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
say
that
in
five
minutes
he
was
fast
asleep
.
  
<EOS>
So
also
had
Frank
travelled
all
night
,
but
the
pony
and
the
fresh
air
kept
him
awake
.
<EOS>
The
boy
had
offered
to
go
with
him
,
but
that
he
had
altogether
refused
;
 
and
,
therefore
,
to
his
other
cares
was
added
that
of
finding
his
way
.
<EOS>
The
sweep
of
the
valleys
,
however
,
is
long
and
not
abrupt
,
and
he
could
hardly
miss
his
road
if
he
would
only
make
one
judicious
turn
through
a
gap
in
a
certain
wall
which
lay
half
way
between
the
cottage
and
the
castle
.
<EOS>
He
was
thinking
of
the
work
in
hand
,
and
he
found
the
gap
without
difficulty
.
<EOS>
When
through
that
he
ascended
the
hill
for
two
miles
,
and
then
the
sea
was
before
him
,
and
Portray
Castle
,
lying
,
as
it
seemed
to
him
at
that
distance
,
close
upon
the
sea
-
shore
.
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
word
,
Lizzie
has
not
done
badly
for
herself
,
"
he
said
almost
aloud
,
as
he
looked
down
upon
the
fair
sight
beneath
him
,
and
round
upon
the
mountains
,
and
remembered
that
,
for
her
life
at
least
,
it
was
all
hers
,
and
after
her
death
would
belong
to
her
son
.
<EOS>
What
more
does
any
human
being
desire
of
such
a
property
than
that
?
  
<EOS>
He
rode
down
to
the
great
doorway
,
 
the
mountain
track
which
fell
on
to
the
road
about
half
a
mile
from
the
castle
having
been
plain
enough
,
and
there
he
gave
up
the
pony
into
the
hands
of
no
less
a
man
than
Mr.
Gowran
himself
.
<EOS>
Gowran
had
watched
the
pony
coming
down
the
mountain
-
side
,
and
had
desired
to
see
of
what
like
was
"
her
leddyship
's
"
cousin
.
<EOS>
In
telling
the
whole
truth
of
Mr.
Gowran
,
it
must
be
acknowledged
that
he
thought
that
his
late
master
had
made
a
very
great
mistake
in
the
matter
of
his
marriage
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
imagine
bad
things
enough
of
Lady
Eustace
,
and
almost
believed
that
she
was
not
now
,
and
had
n't
been
before
her
marriage
,
any
better
than
she
should
be
.
<EOS>
The
name
of
Admiral
Greystock
,
as
having
been
the
father
of
his
mistress
,
had
indeed
reached
his
ears
;
but
Andy
Gowran
was
a
suspicious
man
,
and
felt
no
confidence
even
in
an
admiral
,
 
in
regard
to
whom
he
heard
nothing
of
his
having
,
or
having
had
,
a
wife
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
my
fer
-
rm
opeenion
<EOS>
she
's
jist
naebody
 
and
waur
,
"
he
had
said
more
than
once
to
his
own
wife
,
nodding
his
head
with
great
emphasis
at
the
last
word
.
<EOS>
He
was
very
anxious
,
therefore
,
to
see
"
her
leddyship
's
"
cousin
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Gowran
thought
that
he
knew
a
gentleman
when
he
saw
one
.
<EOS>
He
thought
,
also
,
that
he
knew
a
lady
,
and
that
he
did
n't
see
one
when
he
was
engaged
with
his
mistress
.
<EOS>
Cousin
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
For
the
matter
o
'
that
,
ony
man
that
comes
the
way
may
be
ca'ed
a
coosin
.
"
<EOS>
So
Mr.
Gowran
was
on
the
grand
sweep
before
the
garden
gate
,
and
took
the
pony
from
Frank
's
hand
.
<EOS>
"
Is
Lady
Eustace
at
home
?
"
<EOS>
Frank
asked
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Gowran
perceived
that
Frank
was
a
gentleman
,
and
was
disappointed
.
<EOS>
And
Frank
did
n't
come
as
a
man
comes
who
calls
himself
by
a
false
name
,
and
pretends
to
be
an
honest
cousin
when
in
fact
he
is
something
,
 
<EOS>
oh
,
ever
so
wicked
!
<EOS>
Mr.
Gowran
,
who
was
a
stern
moralist
,
was
certainly
disappointed
at
Frank
's
appearance
.
  
<EOS>
Lizzie
was
in
a
little
sitting
-
room
,
reached
by
a
long
passage
with
steps
in
the
middle
,
at
some
corner
of
the
castle
which
seemed
a
long
way
from
the
great
door
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
cheerful
little
room
,
with
chintz
curtains
,
and
a
few
shelves
laden
with
brightly
-
bound
books
,
which
had
been
prepared
for
Lizzie
immediately
on
her
marriage
.
<EOS>
It
looked
out
upon
the
sea
,
and
she
had
almost
taught
herself
to
think
that
here
she
had
sat
with
her
adored
Florian
,
gazing
in
mutual
ecstasy
upon
the
"
wide
expanse
of
glittering
waves
.
<EOS>
"
She
was
lying
back
in
a
low
arm
-
chair
as
her
cousin
entered
,
and
she
did
not
rise
to
receive
him
.
<EOS>
Of
course
she
was
alone
,
Miss
Macnulty
having
received
a
suggestion
that
it
would
be
well
that
she
should
do
a
little
gardening
in
the
moat
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
Frank
?
<EOS>
"
she
said
,
with
her
sweetest
smile
,
as
she
gave
him
her
hand
.
<EOS>
She
felt
and
understood
the
extreme
intimacy
which
would
be
implied
by
her
not
rising
to
receive
him
.
<EOS>
As
she
could
not
rush
into
his
arms
there
was
no
device
by
which
she
could
more
clearly
show
to
him
how
close
she
regarded
his
friendship
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
I
am
at
Portray
Castle
at
last
,
"
he
said
,
still
holding
her
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
 
at
the
dullest
,
dreariest
,
deadliest
spot
in
all
Christendom
,
I
think
,
 
if
Ayrshire
be
Christendom
.
<EOS>
But
never
mind
about
that
now
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
,
as
you
are
at
the
other
side
of
the
mountain
at
the
Cottage
,
we
shall
find
it
less
dull
here
at
the
castle
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
thought
you
were
to
be
so
happy
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Sit
down
and
we
'll
talk
it
all
over
by
degrees
.
<EOS>
What
will
you
have
,
 
breakfast
or
lunch
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Neither
,
thank
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
you
'll
stay
to
dinner
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
I
've
a
man
there
at
the
Cottage
with
me
who
would
cut
his
throat
in
his
solitude
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Let
him
cut
his
throat
;
 
but
never
mind
now
.
<EOS>
As
for
being
happy
,
women
are
never
happy
without
men
.
<EOS>
I
need
n't
tell
any
lies
to
you
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
What
makes
me
sure
that
this
fuss
about
making
men
and
women
all
the
same
must
be
wrong
,
is
just
the
fact
that
men
can
get
along
without
women
,
and
women
ca
n't
without
men
.
<EOS>
My
life
has
been
a
burthen
to
me
.
<EOS>
But
never
mind
.
<EOS>
Tell
me
about
my
lord
;
 
my
lord
and
master
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Lord
Fawn
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Who
else
?
<EOS>
What
other
lord
and
master
?
<EOS>
My
bosom
's
own
;
my
heart
's
best
hope
;
my
spot
of
terra
firma
;
my
cool
running
brook
of
fresh
water
;
my
rock
;
my
love
;
my
lord
;
my
all
!
<EOS>
Is
he
always
thinking
of
his
absent
Lizzie
?
<EOS>
Does
he
still
toil
at
Downing
Street
?
<EOS>
Oh
,
dear
;
do
you
remember
,
Frank
,
when
he
told
us
that
"
one
of
us
must
remain
in
town
?
"
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
have
seen
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
So
you
wrote
me
word
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
have
seen
a
very
obstinate
,
pig
-
headed
,
but
nevertheless
honest
and
truth
-
speaking
gentleman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Frank
,
I
do
n't
care
twopence
for
his
honesty
and
truth
.
<EOS>
If
he
ill
-
treats
me
 
"
Then
she
paused
;
looking
into
his
face
<EOS>
she
had
seen
at
once
by
the
manner
in
which
he
had
taken
her
badinage
,
without
a
smile
,
that
it
was
necessary
that
she
should
be
serious
as
to
her
matrimonial
prospects
.
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
I
had
better
let
you
tell
your
story
,
"
she
said
,
"
and
I
will
sit
still
and
listen
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
means
to
ill
-
treat
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
will
let
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
had
better
listen
,
as
you
promised
,
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
He
declares
that
the
marriage
must
be
off
at
once
unless
you
will
send
those
diamonds
to
Mr.
Camperdown
or
to
the
jewellers
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
by
what
law
or
rule
does
he
justify
himself
in
a
decision
so
monstrous
?
<EOS>
Is
he
prepared
to
prove
that
the
property
is
not
my
own
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
ask
me
my
opinion
as
a
lawyer
,
I
doubt
whether
any
such
proof
can
be
shown
.
<EOS>
But
as
a
man
and
a
friend
I
do
advise
you
to
give
them
up
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Never
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
,
of
course
,
judge
for
yourself
;
 
but
that
is
my
advice
.
<EOS>
You
had
better
,
however
,
hear
my
whole
story
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Certainly
,
"
said
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
Her
whole
manner
was
now
changed
.
<EOS>
She
had
extricated
herself
from
the
crouching
position
in
which
her
feet
,
her
curl
,
her
arms
,
her
whole
body
had
been
so
arranged
as
to
combine
the
charm
of
her
beauty
with
the
charm
of
proffered
intimacy
.
<EOS>
Her
dress
was
such
as
a
woman
would
wear
to
receive
her
brother
,
and
yet
it
had
been
studied
.
<EOS>
She
had
no
gems
about
her
<EOS>
but
what
she
might
well
wear
in
her
ordinary
life
,
and
yet
the
very
rings
on
her
fingers
had
not
been
put
on
without
reference
to
her
cousin
Frank
.
<EOS>
Her
position
had
been
one
of
lounging
ease
,
such
as
a
woman
might
adopt
when
all
alone
,
giving
herself
all
the
luxuries
of
solitude
;
 
but
she
had
adopted
it
in
special
reference
to
cousin
Frank
.
<EOS>
Now
she
was
in
earnest
,
with
business
before
her
;
and
though
it
may
be
said
of
her
that
she
could
never
forget
her
appearance
in
presence
of
a
man
whom
she
desired
to
please
,
her
curl
,
and
rings
,
and
attitude
were
for
the
moment
in
the
background
.
<EOS>
She
had
seated
herself
on
a
common
chair
,
with
her
hands
upon
the
table
,
and
was
looking
into
Frank
's
face
with
eager
,
eloquent
,
and
combative
eyes
.
<EOS>
She
would
take
his
law
,
because
she
believed
in
it
;
but
,
as
far
as
she
could
see
as
yet
,
she
would
not
take
his
advice
unless
it
were
backed
by
his
law
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Camperdown
,
"
continued
Greystock
,
"
has
consented
to
prepare
a
case
for
opinion
,
though
he
will
not
agree
that
the
Eustace
estate
shall
be
bound
by
that
opinion
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
what
's
the
good
of
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
shall
at
least
know
,
all
of
us
,
what
is
the
opinion
of
some
lawyer
qualified
to
understand
the
circumstances
of
the
case
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
is
n't
your
opinion
as
good
as
that
of
any
lawyer
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
could
n't
give
an
opinion
;
 
not
otherwise
than
as
a
private
friend
to
you
,
which
is
worth
nothing
,
unless
for
your
private
guidance
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Camperdown
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
do
n't
care
one
straw
for
Mr.
Camperdown
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Just
let
me
finish
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
certainly
;
 
and
you
must
n't
be
angry
with
me
,
Frank
.
<EOS>
The
matter
is
so
much
to
me
;
is
n't
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wo
n't
be
angry
.
<EOS>
Do
I
look
as
if
I
were
angry
?
<EOS>
Mr.
Camperdown
is
right
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
daresay
he
may
be
 
what
you
call
right
.
<EOS>
But
I
do
n't
care
about
Mr.
Camperdown
a
bit
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
has
no
power
,
nor
has
John
Eustace
any
power
,
to
decide
that
the
property
which
may
belong
to
a
third
person
shall
be
jeopardised
by
any
arbitration
.
<EOS>
The
third
person
could
not
be
made
to
lose
his
legal
right
by
any
such
arbitration
,
and
his
claim
,
if
made
,
would
still
have
to
be
tried
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Who
is
the
third
person
,
Frank
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Your
own
child
at
present
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
will
not
he
have
it
any
way
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Camperdown
and
John
Eustace
say
that
it
belongs
to
him
at
present
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
point
that
,
no
doubt
,
should
be
settled
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
To
whom
do
you
say
that
it
belongs
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
a
question
I
am
not
prepared
to
answer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
To
whom
do
you
think
that
it
belongs
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
refused
to
look
at
a
single
paper
on
the
subject
,
and
my
opinion
is
worth
nothing
.
<EOS>
From
what
I
have
heard
in
conversation
with
Mr.
Camperdown
and
John
Eustace
,
I
can
not
find
that
they
make
their
case
good
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nor
can
I
,
"
said
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
case
is
to
be
prepared
for
Mr.
Dove

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Who
is
Mr.
Dove
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Dove
is
a
barrister
,
and
no
doubt
a
very
clever
fellow
.
<EOS>
If
his
opinion
be
such
as
Mr.
Camperdown
expects
,
he
will
at
once
proceed
against
you
at
law
for
the
immediate
recovery
of
the
necklace
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
ready
for
him
,
"
said
Lizzie
,
and
as
she
spoke
all
her
little
feminine
softnesses
were
for
the
moment
laid
aside
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
Mr.
Dove
's
opinion
be
in
your
favour
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
Well
,
"
said
Lizzie
,
 
"
<EOS>
what
then
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
In
that
case
Mr.
Camperdown
,
acting
on
behalf
of
John
Eustace
and
young
Florian
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
How
dreadful
it
is
to
hear
of
my
bitterest
enemy
acting
on
behalf
of
my
own
child
!
"
said
Lizzie
,
holding
up
her
hands
piteously
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
In
that
case
Mr.
Camperdown
will
serve
you
with
some
notice
that
the
jewels
are
not
yours
,
 
to
part
with
them
as
you
may
please
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
they
will
be
mine
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
says
not
;
 
but
in
such
case
he
will
content
himself
with
taking
steps
which
may
prevent
you
from
selling
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Who
says
that
I
want
to
sell
them
?
"
demanded
Lizzie
indignantly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Or
from
giving
them
away
,
 
say
to
a
second
husband
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
little
they
know
me
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Now
I
have
told
you
all
about
Mr.
Camperdown
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
the
next
thing
is
to
tell
you
about
Lord
Fawn
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
everything
.
<EOS>
I
care
nothing
for
Mr.
Camperdown
;
nor
yet
for
Mr.
Dove
,
 
if
that
is
his
absurd
name
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
is
of
more
moment
to
me
,
 
though
,
indeed
,
he
has
given
me
but
little
cause
to
say
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
In
the
first
place
,
I
must
explain
to
you
that
Lord
Fawn
is
very
unhappy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
may
thank
himself
for
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
pulled
this
way
and
that
,
and
is
half
distraught
;
but
he
has
stated
with
as
much
positive
assurance
as
such
a
man
can
assume
,
that
the
match
must
be
regarded
as
broken
off
unless
you
will
at
once
restore
the
necklace
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
does
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
has
commissioned
me
to
give
you
that
message
;
 
and
it
is
my
duty
,
Lizzie
,
as
your
friend
,
to
tell
you
my
conviction
that
he
repents
his
engagement
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
now
rose
from
her
chair
and
began
to
walk
about
the
room
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
shall
not
go
back
from
it
.
<EOS>
He
shall
learn
that
I
am
not
a
creature
at
his
own
disposal
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
He
shall
find
that
I
have
some
strength
,
 
if
you
have
none
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
would
you
have
had
me
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Taken
him
by
the
throat
,
"
said
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
"
Taking
by
the
throat
in
these
days
seldom
forwards
any
object
,
 
unless
the
taken
one
be
known
to
the
police
.
<EOS>
I
think
Lord
Fawn
is
behaving
very
badly
,
and
I
have
told
him
so
.
<EOS>
No
doubt
he
is
under
the
influence
of
others
,
 
mother
and
sisters
,
 
who
are
not
friendly
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
False
-
faced
idiots
!
"
said
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
himself
is
somewhat
afraid
of
me
,
 
is
much
afraid
of
you
;
 
is
afraid
of
what
people
will
say
of
him
;
and
,
 
to
give
him
his
due
,
 
is
afraid
also
of
doing
what
is
wrong
.
<EOS>
He
is
timid
,
weak
,
conscientious
,
and
wretched
.
<EOS>
If
you
have
set
your
heart
upon
marrying
him
 
"
  
"
My
heart
!
"
said
Lizzie
scornfully
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Or
your
mind
,
 
<EOS>
you
can
have
him
by
simply
sending
the
diamonds
to
the
jewellers
.
<EOS>
Whatever
may
be
his
wishes
,
in
that
case
he
will
redeem
his
word
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Not
for
him
or
all
that
belongs
to
him
!
<EOS>
It
would
n't
be
much
.
<EOS>
He
's
just
a
pauper
with
a
name
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
your
loss
will
be
so
much
the
less
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
what
right
has
he
to
treat
me
so
?
<EOS>
Did
you
ever
before
hear
of
such
a
thing
?
<EOS>
Why
is
he
to
be
allowed
to
go
back
,
 
without
punishment
,
 
more
than
another
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
punishment
would
you
wish
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
That
he
should
be
beaten
within
an
inch
of
his
life
;
 
and
if
the
inch
were
not
there
,
I
should
not
complain
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
am
to
do
it
,
 
to
my
absolute
ruin
,
and
to
your
great
injury
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
could
almost
do
it
myself
.
"
<EOS>
And
Lizzie
raised
her
hand
as
though
there
were
some
weapon
in
it
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
,
Frank
,
there
must
be
something
.
<EOS>
You
would
n't
have
me
sit
down
and
bear
it
.
<EOS>
All
the
world
has
been
told
of
the
engagement
.
<EOS>
There
must
be
some
punishment
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
would
not
wish
to
have
an
action
brought
,
 
for
breach
of
promise
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
wish
to
do
whatever
would
hurt
him
most
,
 
without
hurting
myself
,
"
said
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
wo
n't
give
up
the
necklace
?
"
said
Frank
.
  
<EOS>
"
Certainly
not
,
"
said
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
"
Give
it
up
for
his
sake
,
 
a
man
that
I
have
always
despised
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
you
had
better
let
him
go
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
let
him
go
.
<EOS>
What
,
 
to
be
pointed
at
as
the
woman
that
Lord
Fawn
had
jilted
?
<EOS>
Never
!
<EOS>
My
necklace
should
be
nothing
more
to
him
than
this
ring
.
"
<EOS>
And
she
drew
from
her
finger
a
little
circlet
of
gold
with
a
stone
,
for
which
she
had
owed
Messrs.
Harter
and
Benjamin
five
-
and
-
thirty
pounds
till
Sir
Florian
had
settled
that
account
for
her
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
cause
can
he
give
for
such
treatment
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
acknowledges
that
there
is
no
cause
which
he
can
state
openly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
am
to
bear
it
?
<EOS>
And
it
is
you
that
tell
me
so
?
<EOS>
Oh
,
Frank
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Let
us
understand
each
other
,
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
fight
him
,
 
that
is
,
with
pistols
;
nor
will
I
attempt
to
thrash
him
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
useless
to
argue
whether
public
opinion
is
right
or
wrong
;
but
public
opinion
is
now
so
much
opposed
to
that
kind
of
thing
,
that
it
is
out
of
the
question
.
<EOS>
I
should
injure
your
position
and
destroy
my
own
.
<EOS>
If
you
mean
to
quarrel
with
me
on
that
score
,
you
had
better
say
so
.
"
  
<EOS>
Perhaps
at
that
moment
he
almost
wished
that
she
would
quarrel
with
him
,
but
she
was
otherwise
disposed
.
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Frank
,
"
she
said
,
"
do
not
desert
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
desert
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
feel
that
I
am
ill
-
used
,
Frank
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
.
<EOS>
I
think
that
his
conduct
is
inexcusable
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
there
is
to
be
no
punishment
?
<EOS>
"
she
asked
,
with
that
strong
indignation
at
injustice
which
the
unjust
always
feel
when
they
are
injured
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
carry
yourself
well
,
 
quietly
and
with
dignity
,
 
the
world
will
punish
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
believe
a
bit
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
a
Patient
Grizel
who
can
content
myself
with
heaping
benefits
on
those
who
injure
me
,
and
then
thinking
that
they
are
coals
of
fire
.
<EOS>
Lucy
Morris
is
one
of
that
sort
.
"
<EOS>
Frank
ought
to
have
resented
the
attack
,
but
he
did
not
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
such
tame
virtues
.
<EOS>
I
'll
tell
him
to
his
face
what
he
is
.
<EOS>
I
'll
lead
him
such
a
life
that
he
shall
be
sick
of
the
very
name
of
necklace
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
can
not
ask
him
to
marry
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
.
<EOS>
What
,
not
ask
a
man
to
keep
his
promise
when
you
are
engaged
to
him
?
<EOS>
I
am
not
going
to
be
such
a
girl
as
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
love
him
,
then
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Love
him
!
<EOS>
I
hate
him
.
<EOS>
I
always
despised
him
,
and
now
I
hate
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
yet
you
would
marry
him
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Not
for
worlds
,
Frank
.
<EOS>
No
.
<EOS>
Because
you
advised
me
,
I
thought
that
I
would
do
so
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
you
did
,
Frank
.
<EOS>
But
for
you
I
would
never
have
dreamed
of
taking
him
.
<EOS>
You
know
,
Frank
,
how
it
was
,
 
when
you
told
me
of
him
and
would
n't
come
to
me
yourself
.
"
<EOS>
Now
again
she
was
sitting
close
to
him
and
had
her
hand
upon
his
arm
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
Frank
;
even
to
please
you
I
could
not
marry
him
now
.
<EOS>
But
I
'll
tell
you
what
I
'll
do
.
<EOS>
He
shall
ask
me
again
.
<EOS>
In
spite
of
those
idiots
at
Richmond
he
shall
kneel
at
my
feet
,
 
necklace
or
no
necklace
;
and
then
,
 
then
I
'll
tell
him
what
I
think
of
him
.
<EOS>
Marry
him
!
<EOS>
I
would
not
touch
him
with
a
pair
of
tongs
.
<EOS>
"
As
she
said
this
,
she
was
holding
her
cousin
fast
by
the
hand
.
   
<EOS>
Showing
What
Frank
Greystock
Thought
About
Marriage
 
<EOS>
It
had
not
been
much
after
noon
when
Frank
Greystock
reached
Portray
Castle
,
and
it
was
very
nearly
five
when
he
left
it
.
<EOS>
Of
course
he
had
lunched
with
the
two
ladies
,
and
as
the
conversation
before
lunch
had
been
long
and
interesting
,
they
did
not
sit
down
till
near
three
.
<EOS>
Then
Lizzie
had
taken
him
out
to
show
him
the
grounds
and
garden
,
and
they
had
clambered
together
down
to
the
sea
-
beach
.
"
<EOS>
Leave
me
here
,
"
she
had
said
,
when
he
insisted
on
going
because
of
his
friend
at
the
Cottage
.
<EOS>
When
he
suggested
that
she
would
want
help
to
climb
back
up
the
rocks
to
the
castle
,
she
shook
her
head
,
as
though
her
heart
was
too
full
to
admit
of
a
consideration
so
trifling
.
<EOS>
"
My
thoughts
flow
more
freely
here
with
the
surge
of
the
water
in
my
ears
,
than
they
will
with
that
old
woman
droning
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
come
here
often
,
and
know
every
rock
and
every
stone
.
<EOS>
"
That
was
not
exactly
true
,
as
she
had
never
been
down
but
once
before
.
<EOS>
"
You
mean
to
come
again
?
"
<EOS>
He
told
her
that
of
course
he
should
come
again
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
name
neither
day
nor
hour
.
<EOS>
I
have
nothing
to
take
me
away
.
<EOS>
If
I
am
not
at
the
castle
I
shall
be
at
this
spot
.
<EOS>
Good
-
bye
,
Frank
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
took
her
in
his
arms
and
kissed
her
,
 
of
course
as
a
brother
;
and
then
he
clambered
up
,
got
on
his
pony
,
and
rode
away
.
<EOS>
"
I
dinna
ken
just
what
to
mak
"
o
'
him
,
"
said
Gowran
to
his
wife
.
<EOS>
"
May
be
he
is
her
coosin
;
but
coosins
are
nae
that
sib
that
a
weedow
is
to
be
hailed
aboot
jist
ane
as
though
she
were
ony
quean
at
a
fair
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
From
which
it
may
be
inferred
that
Mr.
Gowran
had
watched
the
pair
as
they
were
descending
together
towards
the
shore
.
  
<EOS>
Frank
had
so
much
to
think
of
,
riding
back
to
the
Cottage
,
that
when
he
came
to
the
gap
,
instead
of
turning
round
along
the
wall
down
the
valley
,
he
took
the
track
right
on
across
the
mountain
and
lost
his
way
.
<EOS>
He
had
meant
to
be
back
at
the
Cottage
by
three
or
four
,
and
yet
had
made
his
visit
to
the
castle
so
long
,
that
without
any
losing
of
his
way
he
could
not
have
been
there
before
seven
.
<EOS>
As
it
was
,
when
that
hour
arrived
,
he
was
up
on
the
top
of
a
hill
,
and
could
again
see
Portray
Castle
clustering
down
close
upon
the
sea
,
and
the
thin
belt
of
trees
,
and
the
shining
water
beyond
;
 
but
of
the
road
to
the
Cottage
he
knew
nothing
.
<EOS>
For
a
moment
he
thought
of
returning
to
Portray
,
till
he
had
taught
himself
to
perceive
that
the
distance
was
much
greater
than
it
had
been
from
the
spot
at
which
he
had
first
seen
the
castle
in
the
morning
;
 
and
then
he
turned
his
pony
round
and
descended
on
the
other
side
.
  
<EOS>
His
mind
was
very
full
of
Lizzie
Eustace
,
and
full
also
of
Lucy
Morris
.
<EOS>
If
it
were
to
be
asserted
here
that
a
young
man
may
be
perfectly
true
to
a
first
young
woman
while
he
is
falling
in
love
with
a
second
,
the
readers
of
this
story
would
probably
be
offended
.
<EOS>
But
undoubtedly
many
men
believe
themselves
to
be
quite
true
while
undergoing
this
process
,
and
many
young
women
expect
nothing
else
from
their
lovers
.
<EOS>
If
only
he
will
come
right
at
last
,
they
are
contented
.
<EOS>
And
if
he
do
n't
come
right
at
all
,
 
it
is
the
way
of
the
world
,
and
the
game
has
to
be
played
over
again
.
<EOS>
Lucy
Morris
,
no
doubt
,
had
lived
a
life
too
retired
for
the
learning
of
such
useful
forbearance
,
but
Frank
Greystock
was
quite
a
proficient
.
<EOS>
He
still
considered
himself
to
be
true
to
Lucy
Morris
,
with
a
truth
seldom
found
in
this
degenerate
age
,
 
with
a
truth
to
which
he
intended
to
sacrifice
some
of
the
brightest
hopes
of
his
life
,
 
with
a
truth
which
,
after
much
thought
,
he
had
generously
preferred
to
his
ambition
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
there
was
found
some
shade
of
regret
to
tinge
the
merit
which
he
assumed
on
this
head
,
in
respect
of
the
bright
things
which
it
would
be
necessary
that
he
should
abandon
;
but
,
if
so
,
the
feeling
only
assisted
him
in
defending
his
present
conduct
from
any
aspersions
his
conscience
might
bring
against
it
.
<EOS>
He
intended
to
marry
Lucy
Morris
,
 
without
a
shilling
,
without
position
,
a
girl
who
had
earned
her
bread
as
a
governess
,
simply
because
he
loved
her
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
wonder
to
himself
that
he
,
a
lawyer
,
a
man
of
the
world
,
a
member
of
Parliament
,
one
who
had
been
steeped
up
to
his
shoulders
in
the
ways
of
the
world
,
should
still
be
so
pure
as
to
be
capable
of
such
a
sacrifice
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
so
;
and
the
sacrifice
would
undoubtedly
be
made
,
 
some
day
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
absurd
in
one
conscious
of
such
high
merit
to
be
afraid
of
the
ordinary
social
incidents
of
life
.
<EOS>
It
is
the
debauched
broken
drunkard
who
should
become
a
teetotaller
,
and
not
the
healthy
hard
-
working
father
of
a
family
who
never
drinks
a
drop
of
wine
till
dinner
-
time
.
<EOS>
He
need
not
be
afraid
of
a
glass
of
champagne
when
,
on
a
chance
occasion
,
he
goes
to
a
picnic
.
<EOS>
Frank
Greystock
was
now
going
to
his
picnic
;
and
,
though
he
meant
to
be
true
to
Lucy
Morris
,
he
had
enjoyed
his
glass
of
champagne
with
Lizzie
Eustace
under
the
rocks
.
<EOS>
He
was
thinking
a
good
deal
of
his
champagne
when
he
lost
his
way
.
  
<EOS>
What
a
wonderful
woman
was
his
cousin
Lizzie
;
 
and
so
unlike
any
other
girl
he
had
ever
seen
!
<EOS>
How
full
she
was
of
energy
,
how
courageous
,
and
,
then
,
how
beautiful
!
<EOS>
No
doubt
her
special
treatment
of
him
was
sheer
flattery
.
<EOS>
He
told
himself
that
it
was
so
.
<EOS>
But
,
after
all
,
flattery
is
agreeable
.
<EOS>
That
she
did
like
him
better
than
anybody
else
was
probable
.
<EOS>
He
could
have
no
feeling
of
the
injustice
he
might
do
to
the
heart
of
a
woman
who
at
the
very
moment
that
she
was
expressing
her
partiality
for
him
,
was
also
expressing
her
anger
that
another
man
would
not
consent
to
marry
her
.
<EOS>
And
then
women
who
have
had
one
husband
already
are
not
like
young
girls
in
respect
to
their
hearts
.
<EOS>
So
at
least
thought
Frank
Greystock
.
<EOS>
Then
he
remembered
the
time
at
which
he
had
intended
to
ask
Lizzie
to
be
his
wife
,
 
the
very
day
on
which
he
would
have
done
so
<EOS>
had
he
been
able
to
get
away
from
that
early
division
at
the
House
,
 
<EOS>
and
he
asked
himself
whether
he
felt
any
regret
on
that
score
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
been
very
nice
to
come
down
to
Portray
Castle
as
to
his
own
mansion
after
the
work
of
the
courts
and
of
the
session
.
<EOS>
Had
Lizzie
become
his
wife
,
her
fortune
would
have
helped
him
to
the
very
highest
steps
beneath
the
throne
.
<EOS>
At
present
he
was
almost
nobody
;
 
because
he
was
so
poor
,
and
in
debt
.
<EOS>
It
was
so
,
undoubtedly
;
but
what
did
all
that
matter
in
comparison
with
the
love
of
Lucy
Morris
?
<EOS>
A
man
is
bound
to
be
true
.
<EOS>
And
he
would
be
true
.
<EOS>
Only
,
as
a
matter
of
course
,
Lucy
must
wait
.
  
<EOS>
When
he
had
first
kissed
his
cousin
up
in
London
,
she
suggested
that
the
kiss
was
given
as
by
a
brother
,
and
asserted
that
it
was
accepted
as
by
a
sister
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
demurred
,
having
been
allowed
the
kiss
.
<EOS>
Nothing
of
the
kind
had
been
said
under
the
rocks
to
-
day
;
 
but
then
that
fraternal
arrangement
,
when
once
made
and
accepted
,
remains
,
no
doubt
,
in
force
for
a
long
time
.
<EOS>
He
did
like
his
cousin
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
He
liked
to
feel
that
he
could
be
her
friend
,
with
the
power
of
domineering
over
her
.
<EOS>
She
,
also
,
was
fond
of
her
own
way
,
and
loved
to
domineer
herself
;
but
the
moment
that
he
suggested
to
her
that
there
might
be
a
quarrel
,
she
was
reduced
to
a
prayer
that
he
would
not
desert
her
.
<EOS>
Such
a
friendship
has
charms
for
a
young
man
,
especially
if
the
lady
be
pretty
.
<EOS>
As
to
Lizzie
's
prettiness
,
no
man
or
woman
could
entertain
a
doubt
.
<EOS>
And
she
had
a
way
of
making
the
most
of
herself
,
which
it
was
very
hard
to
resist
.
<EOS>
Some
young
women
,
when
they
clamber
over
rocks
,
are
awkward
,
heavy
,
unattractive
,
and
troublesome
.
<EOS>
But
Lizzie
had
at
one
moment
touched
him
as
a
fairy
might
have
done
;
had
sprung
at
another
from
stone
to
stone
,
requiring
no
help
;
and
then
,
on
a
sudden
,
had
become
so
powerless
that
he
had
been
forced
almost
to
carry
her
in
his
arms
.
<EOS>
That
,
probably
,
must
have
been
the
moment
which
induced
Mr.
Gowran
to
liken
her
to
a
quean
at
a
fair
.
  
<EOS>
But
,
undoubtedly
,
there
might
be
trouble
.
<EOS>
Frank
was
sufficiently
experienced
in
the
ways
of
the
world
to
know
that
trouble
would
sometimes
come
from
young
ladies
who
treat
young
men
like
their
brothers
,
when
those
young
men
are
engaged
to
other
young
ladies
.
<EOS>
The
other
young
ladies
are
apt
to
disapprove
of
brothers
who
are
not
brothers
by
absolute
right
of
birth
.
<EOS>
He
knew
also
that
all
the
circumstances
of
his
cousin
's
position
would
make
it
expedient
that
she
should
marry
a
second
husband
.
<EOS>
As
he
could
not
be
that
second
husband
,
 
that
matter
was
settled
,
whether
for
good
or
bad
,
 
was
he
not
creating
trouble
,
both
for
her
and
for
himself
?
<EOS>
Then
there
arose
in
his
mind
a
feeling
,
very
strange
,
but
by
no
means
uncommon
,
that
prudence
on
his
part
would
be
mean
,
because
by
such
prudence
he
would
be
securing
safety
for
himself
as
well
as
for
her
.
<EOS>
What
he
was
doing
was
not
only
imprudent
,
 
but
wrong
also
.
<EOS>
He
knew
that
it
was
so
.
<EOS>
But
Lizzie
Eustace
was
a
pretty
young
woman
;
and
,
when
a
pretty
young
woman
is
in
the
case
,
a
man
is
bound
to
think
neither
of
what
is
prudent
,
nor
of
what
is
right
.
<EOS>
Such
was
 
perhaps
his
instinct
rather
than
his
theory
.
<EOS>
For
her
sake
,
if
not
for
his
own
,
he
should
have
abstained
.
<EOS>
She
was
his
cousin
,
and
was
so
placed
in
the
world
as
specially
to
require
some
strong
hand
to
help
her
.
<EOS>
He
knew
her
to
be
,
in
truth
,
heartless
,
false
,
and
greedy
;
but
she
had
so
lived
that
even
yet
her
future
life
might
be
successful
.
<EOS>
He
had
called
himself
her
friend
as
well
as
cousin
,
and
was
bound
to
protect
her
from
evil
,
if
protection
were
possible
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
adding
to
all
her
difficulties
,
because
she
pretended
to
be
in
love
with
him
.
<EOS>
He
knew
that
it
was
pretence
;
and
yet
,
because
she
was
pretty
,
and
because
he
was
a
man
,
he
could
not
save
her
from
herself
.
<EOS>
"
It
does
n't
do
to
be
wiser
than
other
men
,
"
he
said
to
himself
as
he
looked
round
about
on
the
bare
hill
-
side
.
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
he
had
altogether
lost
his
way
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
between
nine
and
ten
when
he
reached
the
Cottage
.
<EOS>
"
Of
course
you
have
dined
?
"
said
Herriot
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
a
bit
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
left
before
five
,
being
sure
that
I
could
get
here
in
an
hour
and
a
half
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
riding
up
and
down
these
dreary
hills
for
nearly
five
hours
.
<EOS>
You
have
dined
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
was
a
neck
of
mutton
and
a
chicken
.
<EOS>
She
said
the
neck
of
mutton
would
keep
hot
best
,
so
I
took
the
chicken
.
<EOS>
I
hope
you
like
lukewarm
neck
of
mutton
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
hungry
enough
to
eat
anything
;
 
not
but
what
I
had
a
first
-
rate
luncheon
.
<EOS>
What
have
you
done
all
day
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Stone
and
Toddy
,
"
said
Herriot
.
  
<EOS>
"
Stick
to
that
.
<EOS>
If
anything
can
pull
you
through
,
Stone
and
Toddy
will
.
<EOS>
I
lived
upon
them
for
two
years
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Stone
and
Toddy
,
 
with
a
little
tobacco
,
have
been
all
my
comfort
.
<EOS>
I
began
,
however
,
by
sleeping
for
a
few
hours
.
<EOS>
Then
I
went
upon
the
mountains
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
you
take
a
gun
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
took
it
out
of
the
case
,
but
it
did
n't
come
right
,
and
so
I
left
it
.
<EOS>
A
man
came
to
me
and
said
he
was
the
keeper
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
'd
have
put
the
gun
right
for
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
too
bashful
for
that
.
<EOS>
I
persuaded
him
that
I
wanted
to
go
out
alone
and
see
what
birds
there
were
,
and
at
last
I
induced
him
to
stay
here
with
the
old
woman
.
<EOS>
He
's
to
be
at
the
Cottage
at
nine
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
I
hope
that
is
all
right
.
"
  
<EOS>
In
the
evening
,
as
they
smoked
and
drank
whiskey
and
water
,
 
probably
supposing
that
to
be
correct
in
Ayrshire
,
 
they
were
led
on
by
the
combined
warmth
of
the
spirit
,
the
tobacco
,
and
their
friendship
,
to
talk
about
women
.
<EOS>
Frank
,
some
month
or
six
weeks
since
,
in
a
moment
of
soft
confidence
,
had
told
his
friend
of
his
engagement
with
Lucy
Morris
.
<EOS>
Of
Lizzie
Eustace
he
had
spoken
only
as
of
a
cousin
whose
interests
were
dear
to
him
.
<EOS>
Her
engagement
with
Lord
Fawn
was
known
to
all
London
,
and
was
,
therefore
,
known
to
Arthur
Herriot
.
<EOS>
Some
distant
rumour
,
however
,
had
reached
him
that
the
course
of
true
-
love
was
not
running
quite
smooth
,
and
therefore
on
that
subject
he
would
not
speak
,
at
any
rate
till
Greystock
should
first
mention
it
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
How
odd
it
is
to
find
two
women
living
all
alone
in
a
great
house
like
that
,
"
Frank
had
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
Because
so
few
women
have
the
means
to
live
in
large
houses
,
unless
they
live
with
fathers
or
husbands
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
truth
is
,
"
said
Frank
,
"
that
women
do
n't
do
well
alone
.
<EOS>
There
is
always
a
savour
of
misfortune
,
 
or
,
at
least
,
of
melancholy
,
 
about
a
household
which
has
no
man
to
look
after
it
.
<EOS>
With
us
,
generally
,
old
maids
do
n't
keep
houses
,
and
widows
marry
again
.
<EOS>
No
doubt
it
was
an
unconscious
appreciation
of
this
feeling
which
brought
about
the
burning
of
Indian
widows
.
<EOS>
There
is
an
unfitness
in
women
for
solitude
.
<EOS>
A
female
Prometheus
,
even
without
a
vulture
,
would
indicate
cruelty
worse
even
than
Jove
's
.
<EOS>
A
woman
should
marry
,
 
once
,
twice
,
and
thrice
if
necessary
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Women
ca
n't
marry
without
men
to
marry
them
.
"
  
<EOS>
Frank
Greystock
filled
his
pipe
as
he
went
on
with
his
lecture
.
"
<EOS>
That
idea
as
to
the
greater
number
of
women
is
all
nonsense
.
<EOS>
Of
course
we
are
speaking
of
our
own
kind
of
men
and
women
,
and
the
disproportion
of
the
numbers
in
so
small
a
division
of
the
population
amounts
to
nothing
.
<EOS>
We
have
no
statistics
to
tell
us
whether
there
be
any
such
disproportion
in
classes
where
men
do
not
die
early
from
overwork
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
More
females
are
born
than
males
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
more
than
I
know
.
<EOS>
As
one
of
the
legislators
of
the
country
I
am
prepared
to
state
that
statistics
are
always
false
.
<EOS>
What
we
have
to
do
is
to
induce
men
to
marry
.
<EOS>
We
ca
n't
do
it
by
statute
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
thank
God
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nor
yet
by
fashion
.
"
  
"
Fashion
seems
to
be
going
the
other
way
,
"
said
Herriot
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
can
be
only
done
by
education
and
conscience
.
<EOS>
Take
men
of
forty
all
round
,
 
men
of
our
own
class
,
 
you
believe
that
the
married
men
are
happier
than
the
unmarried
?
<EOS>
I
want
an
answer
,
you
know
,
just
for
the
sake
of
the
argument
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
the
married
men
are
the
happier
.
<EOS>
But
you
speak
as
the
fox
who
had
lost
his
tail
;
 
or
,
at
any
rate
,
as
a
fox
in
the
act
of
losing
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Never
mind
my
tail
.
<EOS>
If
morality
in
life
and
enlarged
affections
are
conducive
to
happiness
it
must
be
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Short
commons
and
unpaid
bills
are
conducive
to
misery
.
<EOS>
That
's
what
I
should
say
if
I
wanted
to
oppose
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
came
across
a
man
willing
to
speak
the
truth
who
did
not
admit
that
,
in
the
long
run
,
married
men
are
the
happier
.
<EOS>
As
regards
women
,
there
is
n't
even

Mr.
Dove
's
Opinion
 
Mr.
Thomas
Dove
,
familiarly
known
among
club
-
men
,
attorneys
"
clerks
,
and
,
<EOS>
perhaps
,
even
among
judges
when
very
far
from
their
seats
of
judgment
,
as
Turtle
Dove
,
was
a
counsel
learned
in
the
law
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
counsel
so
learned
in
the
law
,
that
there
was
no
question
within
the
limits
of
an
attorney
's
capability
of
putting
to
him
,
that
he
could
not
answer
with
the
aid
of
his
books
.
<EOS>
And
when
he
had
once
given
an
opinion
,
all
Westminster
could
not
move
him
from
it
,
 
nor
could
Chancery
Lane
and
Lincoln
's
Inn
and
the
Temple
added
to
Westminster
.
<EOS>
When
Mr.
Dove
had
once
been
positive
,
no
man
on
earth
was
more
positive
.
<EOS>
It
behoved
him
,
therefore
,
to
be
right
when
he
was
positive
;
and
though
whether
wrong
or
right
he
was
equally
stubborn
,
it
must
be
acknowledged
that
he
was
seldom
proved
to
be
wrong
.
<EOS>
Consequently
the
attorneys
believed
in
him
,
and
he
prospered
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
thin
man
,
over
fifty
years
of
age
,
very
full
of
scorn
and
wrath
,
impatient
of
a
fool
,
and
thinking
most
men
to
be
fools
;
afraid
of
nothing
on
earth
,
 
and
,
so
his
enemies
said
,
of
nothing
elsewhere
;
eaten
up
by
conceit
;
fond
of
law
,
but
fonder
,
perhaps
,
of
dominion
;
soft
as
milk
to
those
who
acknowledged
his
power
,
but
a
tyrant
to
all
who
contested
it
;
conscientious
,
thoughtful
,
sarcastic
,
bright
-
witted
,
and
laborious
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
man
who
never
spared
himself
.
<EOS>
If
he
had
a
case
in
hand
,
though
the
interest
to
himself
in
it
was
almost
nothing
,
he
would
rob
himself
of
rest
for
a
week
should
a
point
arise
which
required
such
labour
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
theory
of
Mr.
Dove
's
life
that
he
would
never
be
beaten
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
it
was
some
fear
in
this
respect
that
had
kept
him
from
Parliament
and
confined
him
to
the
courts
and
the
company
of
attorneys
.
<EOS>
He
was
,
in
truth
,
a
married
man
with
a
family
;
but
they
who
knew
him
as
the
terror
of
opponents
and
as
the
divulger
of
legal
opinions
,
heard
nothing
of
his
wife
and
children
.
<EOS>
He
kept
all
such
matters
quite
to
himself
,
and
was
not
given
to
much
social
intercourse
with
those
among
whom
his
work
lay
.
<EOS>
Out
at
Streatham
,
where
he
lived
,
Mrs.
Dove
probably
had
her
circle
of
acquaintance
;
 
but
Mr.
Dove
's
domestic
life
and
his
forensic
life
were
kept
quite
separate
.
  
<EOS>
At
the
present
moment
Mr.
Dove
is
interesting
to
us
solely
as
being
the
learned
counsel
in
whom
Mr.
Camperdown
trusted
,
 
to
whom
Mr.
Camperdown
was
willing
to
trust
for
an
opinion
in
so
grave
a
matter
as
that
of
the
Eustace
diamonds
.
<EOS>
A
case
was
made
out
and
submitted
to
Mr.
Dove
immediately
after
that
scene
on
the
pavement
in
Mount
Street
,
at
which
Mr.
Camperdown
had
endeavoured
to
induce
Lizzie
to
give
up
the
necklace
;
and
the
following
is
the
opinion
which
Mr.
Dove
gave
:
    
There
is
much
error
about
heirlooms
.
<EOS>
Many
think
that
any
chattel
may
be
made
an
heirloom
by
any
owner
of
it
.
<EOS>
This
is
not
the
case
.
<EOS>
The
law
,
however
,
does
recognise
heirlooms
;
 
as
to
which
the
Exors
.
<EOS>
or
Admors
.
<EOS>
are
excluded
in
favour
of
the
Successor
;
and
when
there
are
such
heirlooms
they
go
to
the
heir
by
special
custom
.
<EOS>
Any
devise
of
an
heirloom
is
necessarily
void
,
for
the
will
takes
place
after
death
,
and
the
heirloom
is
already
vested
in
the
heir
by
custom
.
<EOS>
We
have
it
from
Littleton
,
that
law
prefers
custom
to
devise
.
  
<EOS>
Brooke
says
,
that
the
best
thing
of
every
sort
may
be
an
heirloom
,
 
such
as
the
best
bed
,
the
best
table
,
the
best
pot
or
pan
.
  
<EOS>
Coke
says
,
that
heirlooms
are
so
by
custom
,
and
not
by
law
.
  
<EOS>
Spelman
says
,
in
defining
an
heirloom
,
that
it
may
be
"
Omne
utensil
robustius
;
"
which
would
exclude
a
necklace
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
"
Termes
de
Ley
,
"
it
is
defined
as
"
Ascun
parcel
des
ustensiles
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
We
are
told
in
"
Coke
upon
Littleton
,
"
that
Crown
jewels
are
heirlooms
,
which
decision
,
 
as
far
as
it
goes
,
 
denies
the
right
to
other
jewels
.
  
<EOS>
Certain
chattels
may
undoubtedly
be
held
and
claimed
as
being
in
the
nature
of
heirlooms
,
 
as
swords
,
pennons
of
honour
,
garter
and
collar
of
S.
S.
See
case
of
the
Earl
of
Northumberland
;
and
that
of
the
Pusey
horn
,
 
Pusey
v.
Pusey
.
<EOS>
The
journals
of
the
House
of
Lords
,
delivered
officially
to
peers
,
may
be
so
claimed
.
<EOS>
See
Upton
v.
Lord
Ferrers
.
  
<EOS>
A
devisor
may
clearly
devise
or
limit
the
possession
of
chattels
,
making
them
inalienable
by
devisees
in
succession
.
<EOS>
But
in
such
cases
they
will
become
the
absolute
possession
of
the
first
person
seized
in
tail
,
 
even
though
an
infant
,
and
in
case
of
death
without
will
,
would
go
to
the
Exors
.
<EOS>
Such
arrangement
,
therefore
,
can
only
hold
good
for
lives
in
existence
and
for
21
years
afterwards
.
<EOS>
Chattels
so
secured
would
not
be
heirlooms
.
<EOS>
See
Carr
v.
Lord
Errol
,
14
Vesey
,
and
Rowland
v.
Morgan
.
  
<EOS>
Lord
Eldon
remarks
,
that
such
chattels
held
in
families
are
"
rather
favourites
of
the
court
.
<EOS>
"
This
was
in
the
Ormonde
case
.
<EOS>
Executors
,
therefore
,
even
when
setting
aside
any
claim
as
for
heirlooms
,
ought
not
to
apply
such
property
in
payment
of
debts
unless
obliged
.
  
<EOS>
The
law
allows
of
claims
for
paraphernalia
for
widows
,
and
,
having
adjusted
such
claims
,
seems
to
show
that
the
claim
may
be
limited
.
  
<EOS>
If
a
man
deliver
cloth
to
his
wife
,
and
die
,
she
shall
have
it
,
though
she
had
not
fashioned
it
into
the
garment
intended
.
  
<EOS>
Pearls
and
jewels
,
even
though
only
worn
on
state
occasions
,
may
go
to
the
widow
as
paraphernalia
,
 
but
with
a
limit
.
<EOS>
In
the
case
of
Lady
Douglas
,
she
being
the
daughter
of
an
Irish
Earl
and
widow
of
the
King
's
Sergeant
(
temp
.
<EOS>
Car
.
<EOS>
I.
)
,
it
was
held
that
£
370
was
not
too
much
,
and
she
was
allowed
a
diamond
and
a
pearl
chain
to
that
value
.
  
<EOS>
In
1674
,
Lord
Keeper
Finch
declared
that
he
would
never
allow
paraphernalia
,
except
to
the
widow
of
a
nobleman
.
  
<EOS>
But
in
1721
Lord
Macclesfield
gave
Mistress
Tipping
paraphernalia
to
the
value
of
£
200
,
 
whether
so
persuaded
by
law
and
precedent
,
or
otherwise
,
may
be
uncertain
.
  
<EOS>
Lord
Talbot
allowed
a
gold
watch
as
paraphernalia
.
  
<EOS>
Lord
Hardwicke
went
much
further
,
and
decided
that
Mrs.
Northey
was
entitled
to
wear
jewels
to
the
value
of
£
3000
,
 
saying
that
value
made
no
difference
;
but
seems
to
have
limited
the
nature
of
her
possession
in
the
jewels
by
declaring
her
to
be
entitled
to
wear
them
only
when
full
-
dressed
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
,
I
think
,
clear
that
the
Eustace
estate
can
not
claim
the
jewels
as
an
heirloom
.
<EOS>
They
are
last
mentioned
,
and
,
as
far
as
I
know
,
only
mentioned
as
an
heirloom
in
the
will
of
the
great
-
grandfather
of
the
present
baronet
,
 
if
these
be
the
diamonds
then
named
by
him
.
<EOS>
As
such
,
he
could
not
have
devised
them
to
the
present
claimant
,
as
he
died
in
1820
,
and
the
present
claimant
is
not
yet
two
years
old
.
  
<EOS>
Whether
the
widow
could
claim
them
as
paraphernalia
is
more
doubtful
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
that
Lord
Hardwicke
's
ruling
would
decide
the
case
;
but
,
if
so
,
she
would
,
I
think
,
be
debarred
from
selling
,
as
he
limits
the
use
of
jewels
of
lesser
value
than
these
to
the
wearing
of
them
when
full
-
dressed
.
<EOS>
The
use
being
limited
,
possession
with
power
of
alienation
can
not
be
intended
.
  
<EOS>
The
lady
's
claim
to
them
as
a
gift
from
her
husband
amounts
to
nothing
.
<EOS>
If
they
are
not
hers
by
will
,
 
<EOS>
and
it
seems
that
they
are
not
so
,
 
<EOS>
she
can
only
hold
them
as
paraphernalia
belonging
to
her
station
.
  
<EOS>
I
presume
it
to
be
capable
of
proof
that
the
diamonds
were
not
in
Scotland
when
Sir
Florian
made
his
will
or
when
he
died
.
<EOS>
The
former
fact
might
be
used
as
tending
to
show
his
intention
when
the
will
was
made
.
<EOS>
I
understand
that
he
did
leave
to
his
widow
by
will
all
the
chattels
in
Portray
Castle
.

.
  
<EOS>
When
Mr.
Camperdown
had
thrice
read
this
opinion
,
he
sat
in
his
chair
an
unhappy
old
man
.
<EOS>
It
was
undoubtedly
the
case
that
he
had
been
a
lawyer
for
upwards
of
forty
years
,
and
had
always
believed
that
any
gentleman
could
make
any
article
of
value
an
heirloom
in
his
family
.
<EOS>
The
title
-
deeds
of
vast
estates
had
been
confided
to
his
keeping
,
and
he
had
had
much
to
do
with
property
of
every
kind
;
and
now
he
was
told
that
,
in
reference
to
property
of
a
certain
description
,
 
property
which
,
by
its
nature
,
could
only
belong
to
such
as
they
who
were
his
clients
,
 
he
had
been
long
without
any
knowledge
whatsoever
.
<EOS>
He
had
called
this
necklace
an
heirloom
to
John
Eustace
above
a
score
of
times
;
and
now
he
was
told
by
Mr.
Dove
not
only
that
the
necklace
was
not
an
heirloom
,
but
that
it
could
n't
have
been
an
heirloom
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
man
who
trusted
much
in
a
barrister
,
 
as
was
natural
with
an
attorney
;
but
he
was
now
almost
inclined
to
doubt
Mr.
Dove
.
<EOS>
And
he
was
hardly
more
at
ease
in
regard
to
the
other
clauses
of
the
opinion
.
<EOS>
Not
only
could
not
the
estate
claim
the
necklace
as
an
heirloom
,
but
that
greedy
siren
,
that
heartless
snake
,
that
harpy
of
a
widow
,
 
for
it
was
thus
that
Mr.
Camperdown
in
his
solitude
spoke
to
himself
of
poor
Lizzie
,
perhaps
throwing
in
a
harder
word
or
two
,
 
that
female
swindler
could
claim
it
as
 
paraphernalia
!
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
crumb
of
comfort
for
him
in
the
thought
that
he
could
force
her
to
claim
that
privilege
from
a
decision
of
the
Court
of
Queen
's
Bench
,
and
that
her
greed
would
be
exposed
should
she
do
so
.
<EOS>
And
she
could
be
prevented
from
selling
the
diamonds
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Dove
seemed
to
make
that
quite
clear
.
<EOS>
But
then
there
came
that
other
question
,
as
to
the
inheritance
of
the
property
under
the
husband
's
will
.
<EOS>
That
Sir
Florian
had
not
intended
that
she
should
inherit
the
necklace
,
Mr.
Camperdown
was
quite
certain
.
<EOS>
On
that
point
he
suffered
no
doubt
.
<EOS>
But
would
he
be
able
to
prove
that
the
diamonds
had
never
been
in
Scotland
since
Sir
Florian
's
marriage
?
<EOS>
He
had
traced
their
history
from
that
date
with
all
the
diligence
he
could
use
,
and
he
thought
that
he
knew
it
.
<EOS>
But
it
might
be
doubtful
whether
he
could
prove
it
.
<EOS>
Lady
Eustace
had
first
stated
,
 
had
so
stated
before
she
had
learned
the
importance
of
any
other
statement
,
 
that
Sir
Florian
had
given
her
the
diamonds
in
London
,
as
they
passed
through
London
from
Scotland
to
Italy
,
and
that
she
had
carried
them
thence
to
Naples
,
where
Sir
Florian
had
died
.
<EOS>
If
this
were
so
,
they
could
not
have
been
at
Portray
Castle
till
she
took
them
there
as
a
widow
,
and
they
would
undoubtedly
be
regarded
as
a
portion
of
that
property
which
Sir
Florian
habitually
kept
in
London
.
<EOS>
That
this
was
so
Mr.
Camperdown
entertained
no
doubt
.
<EOS>
But
now
the
widow
alleged
that
Sir
Florian
had
given
the
necklace
to
her
in
Scotland
,
whither
they
had
gone
immediately
after
their
marriage
,
and
that
she
herself
had
brought
them
up
to
London
.
<EOS>
They
had
been
married
on
the
5th
of
September
;
and
by
the
jewellers
"
books
it
was
hard
to
tell
whether
the
trinket
had
been
given
up
to
Sir
Florian
on
the
4th
or
24th
of
September
.
<EOS>
On
the
24th
Sir
Florian
and
his
young
bride
had
undoubtedly
been
in
London
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Camperdown
anathematised
the
carelessness
of
everybody
connected
with
Messrs.
Garnett
's
establishment
.
<EOS>
"
Those
sort
of
people
have
no
more
idea
of
accuracy
than
 
than
 
"
than
he
had
had
of
heirlooms
,
his
conscience
whispered
to
him
,
filling
up
the
blank
.
  
<EOS>
Nevertheless
he
thought
he
could
prove
that
the
necklace
was
first
put
into
Lizzie
's
hands
in
London
.
<EOS>
The
middle
-
aged
and
very
discreet
man
at
Messrs.
Garnett
's
,
who
had
given
up
the
jewel
-
case
to
Sir
Florian
,
was
sure
that
he
had
known
Sir
Florian
to
be
a
married
man
when
he
did
so
.
<EOS>
The
lady
's
maid
who
had
been
in
Scotland
with
Lady
Eustace
,
and
who
was
now
living
in
Turin
,
having
married
a
courier
,
had
given
evidence
before
an
Italian
man
of
law
,
stating
that
she
had
never
seen
the
necklace
till
she
came
to
London
.
<EOS>
There
were
,
moreover
,
the
probabilities
of
the
case
.
<EOS>
Was
it
likely
that
Sir
Florian
should
take
such
a
thing
down
in
his
pocket
to
Scotland
?
<EOS>
And
there
was
the
statement
as
first
made
by
Lady
Eustace
herself
to
her
cousin
Frank
,
repeated
by
him
to
John
Eustace
,
and
not
to
be
denied
by
any
one
.
<EOS>
It
was
all
very
well
for
her
now
to
say
that
she
had
forgotten
;
but
would
any
one
believe
that
on
such
a
subject
she
could
forget
?
  
<EOS>
But
still
the
whole
thing
was
very
uncomfortable
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Dove
's
opinion
,
if
seen
by
Lady
Eustace
and
her
friends
,
would
rather
fortify
them
than
frighten
them
.
<EOS>
Were
she
once
to
get
hold
of
that
word
paraphernalia
,
it
would
be
as
a
tower
of
strength
to
her
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Camperdown
specially
felt
this
,
 
that
whereas
he
had
hitherto
believed
that
no
respectable
attorney
would
take
up
such
a
case
as
that
of
Lady
Eustace
,
he
could
not
now
but
confess
to
himself
that
any
lawyer
seeing
Mr.
Dove
's
opinion
would
be
justified
in
taking
it
up
.
<EOS>
And
yet
he
was
as
certain
as
ever
that
the
woman
was
robbing
the
estate
which
it
was
his
duty
to
guard
,
and
that
should
he
cease
to
be
active
in
the
matter
,
the
necklace
would
be
broken
up
and
the
property
sold
and
scattered
before
a
year
was
out
,
and
then
the
woman
would
have
got
the
better
of
him
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
shall
find
that
we
have
not
done
with
her
yet
,
"
he
said
to
himself
,
as
he
wrote
a
line
to
John
Eustace
.
  
<EOS>
But
John
Eustace
was
out
of
town
,
as
a
matter
of
course
;
 
and
on
the
next
day
Mr.
Camperdown
himself
went
down
and
joined
his
wife
and
family
at
a
little
cottage
which
he
had
at
Dawlish
.
<EOS>
The
necklace
,
however
,
interfered
much
with
his
holiday
.
   
<EOS>
Mr.
Gowran
Is
Very
Funny
 
<EOS>
Frank
Greystock
certainly
went
over
to
Portray
too
often
,
 
so
often
that
the
pony
was
proved
to
be
quite
necessary
.
<EOS>
Miss
Macnulty
held
her
tongue
and
was
gloomy
,
 
believing
that
Lady
Eustace
was
still
engaged
to
Lord
Fawn
,
and
feeling
that
in
that
case
there
should
not
be
so
many
visits
to
the
rocks
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Gowran
was
very
attentive
,
and
could
tell
on
any
day
,
to
five
minutes
,
how
long
the
two
cousins
were
sitting
together
on
the
sea
-
shore
.
<EOS>
Arthur
Herriot
,
who
cared
nothing
for
Lady
Eustace
,
but
who
knew
that
his
friend
had
promised
to
marry
Lucy
Morris
,
was
inclined
to
be
serious
on
the
subject
;
but
,
 
as
is
always
the
case
with
men
,
 
was
not
willing
to
speak
about
it
.
  
<EOS>
Once
,
and
<EOS>
once
only
,
the
two
men
dined
together
at
the
castle
,
 
for
the
doing
of
which
it
was
necessary
that
a
gig
should
be
hired
all
the
way
from
Prestwick
.
<EOS>
Herriot
had
not
been
anxious
to
go
over
,
alleging
various
excuses
,
 
the
absence
of
dress
clothes
,
the
calls
of
Stone
and
Toddy
,
his
bashfulness
,
and
the
absurdity
of
paying
fifteen
shillings
for
a
gig
.
<EOS>
But
he
went
at
last
,
constrained
by
his
friend
,
and
a
very
dull
evening
he
passed
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
was
quite
unlike
her
usual
self
,
 
was
silent
,
grave
,
and
solemnly
courteous
;
Miss
Macnulty
had
not
a
word
to
say
for
herself
;
and
even
Frank
was
dull
.
<EOS>
Arthur
Herriot
had
not
tried
to
exert
himself
,
and
the
dinner
had
been
a
failure
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
think
much
of
my
cousin
,
I
daresay
,
"
said
Frank
,
as
they
were
driving
back
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
is
a
very
pretty
woman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
should
say
that
she
does
not
think
much
of
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Probably
not
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
on
earth
would
n't
you
speak
to
her
?
<EOS>
I
went
on
making
speeches
to
Miss
Macnulty
on
purpose
to
give
you
a
chance
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
generally
talks
about
as
well
as
any
young
woman
I
know
;
but
you
had
not
a
word
to
say
to
her
,
nor
she
to
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Because
you
devoted
yourself
to
Miss
Mac
 
<EOS>
whatever
her
name
is
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
nonsense
,
"
said
Frank
;
"
Lizzie
and
I
are
more
like
brother
and
sister
than
anything
else
.
<EOS>
She
has
no
one
else
belonging
to
her
,
and
she
has
to
come
to
me
for
advice
,
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
.
<EOS>
I
wanted
you
to
like
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
like
people
,
and
people
never
like
me
.
<EOS>
There
is
an
old
saying
that
you
should
know
a
man
seven
years
before
you
poke
his
fire
.
<EOS>
I
want
to
know
persons
seven
years
before
I
can
ask
them
how
they
do
.
<EOS>
To
take
me
out
to
dine
in
this
way
was
of
all
things
the
most
hopeless
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
do
dine
out
,
 
in
London
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
different
.
<EOS>
There
's
a
certain
routine
of
conversation
going
,
and
one
falls
into
it
.
<EOS>
At
such
affairs
as
that
this
evening
one
has
to
be
intimate
,
or
it
is
a
bore
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
mean
to
say
anything
against
Lady
Eustace
.
<EOS>
Her
beauty
is
undeniable
,
and
I
do
n't
doubt
her
cleverness
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
is
sometimes
too
clever
,
"
said
Frank
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
she
is
not
becoming
too
clever
for
you
.
<EOS>
You
've
got
to
remember
that
you
're
due
elsewhere
;
 
eh
,
old
fellow
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
This
was
the
first
word
that
Herriot
had
said
on
the
subject
,
and
to
that
word
Frank
Greystock
made
no
answer
.
<EOS>
But
it
had
its
effect
,
as
also
did
the
gloomy
looks
of
Miss
Macnulty
,
and
the
not
unobserved
presence
of
Mr.
Andy
Gowran
on
various
occasions
.
  
<EOS>
Between
them
they
shot
more
grouse
,
 
so
the
keeper
swore
,
 
than
had
ever
been
shot
on
these
mountains
before
.
<EOS>
Herriot
absolutely
killed
one
or
two
himself
,
to
his
own
great
delight
,
and
Frank
,
who
was
fairly
skilful
,
would
get
four
or
five
in
a
day
.
<EOS>
There
were
excursions
to
be
made
,
and
the
air
of
the
hills
was
in
itself
a
treat
to
both
of
them
.
<EOS>
Though
Greystock
was
so
often
away
at
the
castle
,
Herriot
did
not
find
the
time
hang
heavily
on
his
hands
,
and
was
sorry
when
his
fortnight
was
over
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
shall
stay
a
couple
of
days
longer
,
"
Frank
said
,
when
Herriot
spoke
of
their
return
.
<EOS>
"
The
truth
is
I
must
see
Lizzie
again
.
<EOS>
She
is
bothered
by
business
,
and
I
have
to
see
her
about
a
letter
that
came
this
morning
.
<EOS>
You
need
n't
pull
such
a
long
face
.
<EOS>
There
's
nothing
of
the
kind
you
're
thinking
of
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
thought
so
much
of
what
you
once
said
to
me
about
another
girl
that
I
hope
she
at
any
rate
may
never
be
in
trouble
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
she
never
may
,
 
on
my
account
,
"
said
Frank
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
what
troubles
she
may
have
,
 
as
life
will
be
troublesome
<EOS>
,
I
trust
that
I
may
share
and
lessen
.
"
  
<EOS>
On
that
evening
Herriot
went
,
and
on
the
next
morning
Frank
Greystock
again
rode
over
to
Portray
Castle
;
but
when
he
was
alone
after
Herriot
's
departure
,
he
wrote
a
letter
to
Lucy
Morris
.
<EOS>
He
had
expressed
a
hope
that
he
might
never
be
a
cause
of
trouble
to
Lucy
Morris
,
and
he
knew
that
his
silence
would
trouble
her
.
<EOS>
There
could
be
no
human
being
less
inclined
to
be
suspicious
than
Lucy
Morris
.
<EOS>
Of
that
Frank
was
sure
.
<EOS>
But
there
had
been
an
express
stipulation
with
Lady
Fawn
that
she
should
be
allowed
to
receive
letters
from
him
,
and
she
would
naturally
be
vexed
when
he
did
not
write
to
her
.
<EOS>
So
he
wrote
.
  
<EOS>
Portray
Cottage
,
3
Sept.
,
18
 
.
  
<EOS>
DEAREST
LUCY
,
  
<EOS>
We
have
been
here
for
a
fortnight
,
shooting
grouse
,
wandering
about
the
mountains
,
and
going
to
sleep
on
the
hill
-
sides
.
<EOS>
You
will
say
that
there
never
was
a
time
so
fit
for
the
writing
of
letters
,
but
that
will
be
because
you
have
not
learned
yet
that
the
idler
people
are
,
the
more
inclined
they
are
to
be
idle
.
<EOS>
We
hear
of
Lord
Chancellors
writing
letters
to
their
mothers
every
day
of
their
lives
;
but
men
who
have
nothing
on
earth
to
do
can
not
bring
themselves
to
face
a
sheet
of
paper
.
<EOS>
I
would
promise
that
when
I
am
Lord
Chancellor
I
would
write
to
you
every
day
,
were
it
not
that
when
that
time
comes
I
shall
hope
to
be
always
with
you
.
  
<EOS>
And
,
in
truth
,
I
have
had
to
pay
constant
visits
to
my
cousin
,
who
lives
in
a
big
castle
on
the
sea
-
side
,
ten
miles
from
here
,
over
the
mountains
,
and
who
is
in
a
peck
of
troubles
;
 
in
spite
of
her
prosperity
one
of
the
unhappiest
women
,
I
should
say
,
that
you
could
meet
anywhere
.
<EOS>
You
know
so
much
of
her
affairs
that
,
without
breach
of
trust
,
I
may
say
so
much
.
<EOS>
I
wish
she
had
a
father
or
a
brother
to
manage
her
matters
for
her
;
but
she
has
none
,
and
I
can
not
desert
her
.
<EOS>
Your
Lord
Fawn
is
behaving
badly
to
her
;
and
so
,
as
far
as
I
can
see
,
are
the
people
who
manage
the
Eustace
property
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
,
as
you
know
,
is
not
the
most
tractable
of
women
,
and
altogether
I
have
more
to
do
in
the
matter
than
I
like
.
<EOS>
Riding
ten
miles
backwards
and
forwards
so
often
over
the
same
route
on
a
little
pony
is
not
good
fun
,
but
I
am
almost
glad
the
distance
is
not
less
.
<EOS>
Otherwise
I
might
have
been
always
there
.
<EOS>
I
know
you
do
n't
quite
like
Lizzie
,
but
she
is
to
be
pitied
.
  
<EOS>
I
go
up
to
London
on
Friday
,
but
shall
only
be
there
for
one
or
two
days
,
 
that
is
,
for
one
night
.
<EOS>
I
go
almost
entirely
on
her
business
,
and
must
,
I
fear
,
be
here
again
,
or
at
the
castle
,
before
I
can
settle
myself
either
for
work
or
happiness
.
<EOS>
On
Sunday
night
I
go
down
to
Bobsborough
,
 
where
,
indeed
,
I
ought
to
have
been
earlier
.
<EOS>
I
fear
I
can
not
go
to
Richmond
on
the
Saturday
,
and
on
the
Sunday
Lady
Fawn
would
hardly
make
me
welcome
.
<EOS>
I
shall
be
at
Bobsborough
for
about
three
weeks
,
and
there
,
if
you
have
commands
to
give
,
I
will
obey
them
.
  
<EOS>
I
may
,
however
,
tell
you
the
truth
at
once
,
 
though
it
is
a
truth
you
must
keep
very
much
to
yourself
.
<EOS>
In
the
position
in
which
I
now
stand
as
to
Lord
Fawn
,
 
being
absolutely
forced
to
quarrel
with
him
on
Lizzie
's
behalf
,
 
Lady
Fawn
could
hardly
receive
me
with
comfort
to
herself
.
<EOS>
She
is
the
best
of
women
;
and
,
as
she
is
your
dear
friend
,
nothing
is
further
from
me
than
any
idea
of
quarrelling
with
her
;
but
of
course
she
takes
her
son
's
part
,
and
I
hardly
know
how
all
allusion
to
the
subject
could
be
avoided
.
  
<EOS>
This
,
however
,
dearest
,
need
ruffle
<EOS>
no
feather
between
you
and
me
,
who
love
each
other
better
than
we
love
either
the
Fawns
or
the
Lizzies
.
<EOS>
Let
me
find
a
line
at
my
chambers
to
say
that
it
is
so
,
and
always
shall
be
so
.
  
<EOS>
God
bless
my
own
darling
,
Ever
and
always
your
own
,
  
<EOS>
F.
G.
  
<EOS>
On
the
following
day
he
rode
over
to
the
castle
.
<EOS>
He
had
received
a
letter
from
John
Eustace
,
who
had
found
himself
forced
to
run
up
to
London
to
meet
Mr.
Camperdown
.
<EOS>
The
lawyer
had
thought
to
postpone
further
consideration
of
the
whole
matter
till
he
and
everybody
else
would
be
naturally
in
London
,
 
till
November
that
might
be
,
or
,
perhaps
,
even
till
after
Christmas
.
<EOS>
But
his
mind
was
ill
at
ease
;
and
he
knew
that
so
much
might
be
done
with
the
diamonds
in
four
months
!
<EOS>
They
might
even
now
be
in
the
hands
of
some
Benjamin
or
of
some
Harter
,
and
it
might
soon
be
beyond
the
power
either
of
lawyers
or
of
policemen
to
trace
them
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
went
up
from
Dawlish
and
persuaded
John
Eustace
to
come
from
Yorkshire
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
great
nuisance
,
and
Eustace
freely
anathematised
the
necklace
.
<EOS>
"
If
only
some
one
would
steal
it
,
so
that
we
might
hear
no
more
of
the
thing
!
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
But
,
as
Mr.
Camperdown
had
frequently
remarked
,
the
value
was
too
great
for
trifling
,
and
Eustace
went
up
to
London
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Camperdown
put
into
his
hands
the
Turtle
Dove
's
opinion
,
explaining
that
it
was
by
no
means
expedient
that
it
should
be
shown
to
the
other
party
.
<EOS>
Eustace
thought
that
the
opinion
should
be
common
to
them
all
.
<EOS>
"
We
pay
for
it
,
"
said
Mr.
Camperdown
,
"
and
they
can
get
their
opinion
from
any
other
barrister
if
they
please
.
<EOS>
"
But
what
was
to
be
done
?
<EOS>
Eustace
declared
that
as
to
the
present
whereabouts
of
the
necklace
,
he
did
not
in
the
least
doubt
that
he
could
get
the
truth
from
Frank
Greystock
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
wrote
to
Greystock
,
and
with
that
letter
in
his
pocket
,
Frank
rode
over
to
the
castle
for
the
last
time
.
  
<EOS>
He
,
too
,
was
heartily
sick
of
the
necklace
;
 
but
unfortunately
he
was
not
equally
sick
of
her
who
held
it
in
possession
.
<EOS>
And
he
was
,
too
,
better
alive
to
the
importance
of
the
value
of
the
trinket
than
John
Eustace
,
though
not
so
keenly
as
was
Mr.
Camperdown
.
<EOS>
Lady
Eustace
was
out
somewhere
among
the
cliffs
,
the
servant
said
.
<EOS>
He
regretted
this
as
he
followed
her
,
but
he
was
obliged
to
follow
her
.
<EOS>
Half
way
down
to
the
sea
-
shore
,
much
below
the
knob
on
which
she
had
attempted
to
sit
with
her
Shelley
,
but
yet
not
below
the
need
of
assistance
,
he
found
her
seated
in
a
little
ravine
.
<EOS>
"
I
knew
you
would
come
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
Of
course
she
had
known
that
he
would
come
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
rise
,
or
even
give
him
her
hand
,
but
there
was
a
spot
close
beside
her
on
which
it
was
to
be
presumed
that
he
would
seat
himself
.
<EOS>
She
had
a
volume
of
Byron
in
her
hand
,
 
the
Corsair
,
Lara
,
and
the
Giaour
,
 
a
kind
of
poetry
which
was
in
truth
more
intelligible
to
her
than
Queen
Mab
.
<EOS>
"
You
go
to
-
morrow
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
 
I
go
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
Lubin
has
gone
?
"
<EOS>
Arthur
Herriot
was
Lubin
.
  
<EOS>
"
Lubin
has
gone
.
<EOS>
Though
why
Lubin
,
I
can
not
guess
.
<EOS>
The
normal
Lubin
to
me
is
a
stupid
fellow
always
in
love
.
<EOS>
Herriot
is
not
stupid
and
is
never
in
love
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nevertheless
,
he
is
Lubin
if
I
choose
to
call
him
so
.
<EOS>
Why
did
he
twiddle
his
thumbs
instead
of
talking
?
<EOS>
Have
you
heard
anything
of
Lord
Fawn
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
had
a
letter
from
your
brother
-
in
-
law
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
is
John
the
Just
pleased
to
say
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
John
the
Just
,
which
is
a
better
name
for
the
man
than
the
other
,
has
been
called
up
to
London
,
much
against
his
will
,
by
Mr.
Camperdown
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Who
is
Samuel
the
Unjust
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Camperdown
's
name
was
Samuel
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
now
wants
to
know
where
this
terrible
necklace
is
at
this
present
moment
.
"
<EOS>
He
paused
a
moment
,
but
Lizzie
did
not
answer
him
.
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
you
have
no
objection
to
telling
me
where
it
is
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
None
in
the
least
:
 
or
to
giving
it
you
to
keep
for
me
,
only
that
I
would
not
so
far
trouble
you
.
<EOS>
But
I
have
an
objection
to
telling
them
.
<EOS>
They
are
my
enemies
.
<EOS>
Let
them
find
out
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
wrong
,
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
You
do
not
want
,
or
at
any
rate
should
not
want
,
to
have
any
secret
in
the
matter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
are
here
,
 
in
the
castle
;
in
the
very
place
in
which
Sir
Florian
kept
them
when
he
gave
them
to
me
.
<EOS>
Where
should
my
own
jewels
be
but
in
my
own
house
?
<EOS>
What
does
that
Mr.
Dove
say
,
who
was
to
be
asked
about
them
?
<EOS>
No
doubt
they
can
pay
a
barrister
to
say
anything
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Lizzie
,
you
think
too
hardly
of
people
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
do
not
people
think
too
hardly
of
me
?
<EOS>
Does
not
all
this
amount
to
an
accusation
against
me
that
I
am
a
thief
?
<EOS>
Am
I
not
persecuted
among
them
?
<EOS>
Did
not
this
impudent
attorney
stop
me
in
the
public
street
and
accuse
me
of
theft
before
my
very
servants
?
<EOS>
Have
they
not
so
far
succeeded
in
misrepresenting
me
,
that
the
very
man
who
is
engaged
to
be
my
husband
betrays
me
?
<EOS>
And
now
you
are
turning
against
me
?
<EOS>
Can
you
wonder
that
I
am
hard
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
turning
against
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
you
are
.
<EOS>
You
take
their
part
,
and
not
mine
,
in
everything
.
<EOS>
I
tell
you
what
,
Frank
;
 
I
would
go
out
in
that
boat
that
you
see
yonder
,
and
drop
the
bauble
into
the
sea
,
did
I
not
know
that
they
'd
drag
it
up
again
with
their
devilish
ingenuity
.
<EOS>
If
the
stones
would
burn
,
I
would
burn
them
.
<EOS>
But
the
worst
of
it
all
is
,
that
you
are
becoming
my
enemy
!
"
<EOS>
Then
she
burst
into
violent
and
almost
hysteric
tears
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
will
be
better
that
you
should
give
them
into
the
keeping
of
some
one
whom
you
can
both
trust
,
till
the
law
has
decided
to
whom
they
belong
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
never
give
them
up
.
<EOS>
What
does
Mr.
Dove
say
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
seen
what
Mr.
Dove
says
.
<EOS>
It
is
clear
that
the
necklace
is
not
an
heirloom
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
how
dare
Mr.
Camperdown
say
so
often
that
it
was
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
said
what
he
thought
,
"
pleaded
Frank
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
he
is
a
lawyer
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
a
lawyer
,
and
I
did
not
know
what
is
or
what
is
not
an
heirloom
.
<EOS>
But
Mr.
Dove
is
clearly
of
opinion
that
such
a
property
could
not
have
been
given
away
simply
by
word
of
mouth
.
"
<EOS>
John
Eustace
in
his
letter
had
made
no
allusion
to
that
complicated
question
of
paraphernalia
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
it
was
,
"
said
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
"
Who
can
know
but
<EOS>
myself
,
when
no
one
else
was
present
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
jewels
are
here
now
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Not
in
my
pocket
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
carry
them
about
with
me
.
<EOS>
They
are
in
the
castle
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
will
they
go
back
with
you
to
London
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Was
ever
lady
so
interrogated
?
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
yet
that
I
shall
go
back
to
London
.
<EOS>
Why
am
I
asked
such
questions
?
<EOS>
As
to
you
,
Frank
,
I
would
tell
you
everything
,
 
my
whole
heart
,
if
only
you
cared
to
know
it
.
<EOS>
But
why
is
John
Eustace
to
make
inquiry
as
to
personal
ornaments
which
are
my
own
property
?
<EOS>
If
I
go
to
London
,
I
will
take
them
there
,
and
wear
them
at
every
house
I
enter
.
<EOS>
I
will
do
so
in
defiance
of
Mr.
Camperdown
and
Lord
Fawn
.
<EOS>
I
think
,
Frank
,
that
no
woman
was
ever
so
ill
-
treated
as
I
am
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
himself
thought
that
she
was
ill
-
treated
.
<EOS>
She
had
so
pleaded
her
case
,
and
had
been
so
lovely
in
her
tears
and
her
indignation
,
that
he
began
to
feel
something
like
true
sympathy
for
her
cause
.
<EOS>
What
right
had
he
,
or
had
Mr.
Camperdown
,
or
any
one
,
to
say
that
the
jewels
did
not
belong
to
her
?
<EOS>
And
if
her
claim
to
them
was
just
,
why
should
she
be
persuaded
to
give
up
the
possession
of
them
?
<EOS>
He
knew
well
that
were
she
to
surrender
them
with
the
idea
that
they
should
be
restored
to
her
if
her
claim
were
found
to
be
just
<EOS>
,
she
would
not
get
them
back
very
soon
.
<EOS>
If
once
the
jewels
were
safe
,
locked
up
in
Mr.
Garnett
's
strong
box
,
Mr.
Camperdown
would
not
care
how
long
it
might
be
before
a
jury
or
a
judge
should
have
decided
on
the
case
.
<EOS>
The
burthen
of
proof
would
then
be
thrown
upon
Lady
Eustace
.
<EOS>
In
order
that
she
might
recover
her
own
property
she
would
have
to
thrust
herself
forward
as
a
witness
,
and
appear
before
the
world
a
claimant
,
greedy
for
rich
ornaments
.
<EOS>
Why
should
he
advise
her
to
give
them
up
?
<EOS>
"
I
am
only
thinking
,
"
said
he
,
"
what
may
be
the
best
for
your
own
peace
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Peace
!
"
 
<EOS>
she
exclaimed
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
How
am
I
to
have
peace
?
<EOS>
Remember
the
condition
in
which
I
find
myself
!
<EOS>
Remember
the
manner
in
which
that
man
is
treating
me
,
when
all
the
world
has
been
told
of
my
engagement
to
him
!
<EOS>
When
I
think
of
it
my
heart
is
so
bitter
that
I
am
inclined
to
throw
,
not
the
diamonds
,
but
myself
from
off
the
rocks
.
<EOS>
All
that
remains
to
me
is
the
triumph
of
getting
the
better
of
my
enemies
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Camperdown
shall
never
have
the
diamonds
.
<EOS>
Even
if
they
could
prove
that
they
did
not
belong
to
me
,
they
should
find
them
 
gone
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
they
can
prove
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
flaunt
them
in
the
eyes
of
all
of
them
till
they
do
;
and
then
 
they
shall
be
gone
.
<EOS>
And
I
'll
have
such
revenge
on
Lord
Fawn
before
I
have
done
with
him
,
that
he
shall
know
that
it
may
be
worse
to
have
to
fight
a
woman
than
a
man
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
Frank
,
I
do
not
think
that
I
am
hard
by
nature
,
but
these
things
make
a
woman
hard
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
she
spoke
she
took
his
hand
in
hers
,
and
looked
up
into
his
eyes
through
her
tears
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
that
you
do
not
care
for
me
,
and
you
know
how
much
I
care
for
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
care
for
you
,
Lizzie
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
 
that
little
thing
at
Richmond
is
everything
to
you
.
<EOS>
She
is
tame
and
quiet
,
 
a
cat
that
will
sleep
on
the
rug
before
the
fire
,
and
you
think
that
she
will
never
scratch
.
<EOS>
Do
not
suppose
that
I
mean
to
abuse
her
.
<EOS>
She
was
my
dear
friend
before
you
had
ever
seen
her
.
<EOS>
And
men
,
I
know
,
have
tastes
which
we
women
do
not
understand
.
<EOS>
You
want
what
you
call
 
repose
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
seldom
know
what
we
want
,
I
fancy
.
<EOS>
We
take
what
the
gods
send
us
.
"
<EOS>
Frank
's
words
were
perhaps
more
true
than
wise
.
<EOS>
At
the
present
moment
the
gods
had
clearly
sent
Lizzie
Eustace
to
him
,
and
unless
he
could
call
up
some
increased
strength
of
his
own
,
quite
independent
of
the
gods
,
 
or
of
what
we
may
perhaps
call
chance
,
 
he
would
have
to
put
up
with
the
article
sent
.
  
<EOS>
Lizzie
had
declared
that
she
would
not
touch
Lord
Fawn
with
a
pair
of
tongs
,
and
in
saying
so
had
resolved
that
she
could
not
and
would
not
now
marry
his
lordship
<EOS>
even
were
his
lordship
in
her
power
.
<EOS>
It
had
been
decided
by
her
as
quickly
as
thoughts
flash
,
but
it
was
decided
.
<EOS>
She
would
torture
the
unfortunate
lord
,
but
not
torture
him
by
becoming
his
wife
.
<EOS>
And
,
so
much
being
fixed
as
the
stars
in
heaven
,
might
it
be
possible
that
she
should
even
yet
induce
her
cousin
to
take
the
place
that
had
been
intended
for
Lord
Fawn
?
<EOS>
After
all
that
had
passed
between
them
she
need
hardly
hesitate
to
tell
him
of
her
love
.
<EOS>
And
with
the
same
flashing
thoughts
she
declared
to
herself
that
she
did
love
him
,
and
that
therefore
this
arrangement
would
be
so
much
better
than
that
other
one
which
she
had
proposed
to
herself
.
<EOS>
The
reader
,
perhaps
,
by
this
time
,
has
not
a
high
opinion
of
Lady
Eustace
,
and
may
believe
that
among
other
drawbacks
on
her
character
there
is
especially
this
,
 
that
she
was
heartless
.
<EOS>
But
that
was
by
no
means
her
own
opinion
of
herself
.
<EOS>
She
would
have
described
herself
,
 
and
would
have
meant
to
do
so
with
truth
,
 
as
being
all
heart
.
<EOS>
She
probably
thought
that
an
over
-
amount
of
heart
was
the
malady
under
which
she
specially
suffered
.
<EOS>
Her
heart
was
overflowing
now
towards
the
man
who
was
sitting
by
her
side
.
<EOS>
And
then
it
would
be
so
pleasant
to
punish
that
little
chit
who
had
spurned
her
gift
and
had
dared
to
call
her
mean
!
<EOS>
This
man
,
too
,
was
needy
,
and
she
was
wealthy
.
<EOS>
Surely
,
were
she
to
offer
herself
to
him
,
the
generosity
of
the
thing
would
make
it
noble
.
<EOS>
She
was
still
dissolved
in
tears
and
was
still
hysteric
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
Frank
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
and
threw
herself
upon
his
breast
.
  
<EOS>
Frank
Greystock
felt
his
position
to
be
one
of
intense
difficulty
,
but
whether
his
difficulty
was
increased
or
diminished
by
the
appearance
of
Mr.
Andy
Gowran
's
head
over
a
rock
at
the
entrance
of
the
little
cave
in
which
they
were
sitting
,
it
might
be
difficult
to
determine
.
<EOS>
But
there
was
the
head
.
<EOS>
And
it
was
not
a
head
that
just
popped
itself
up
and
then
retreated
,
as
a
head
would
do
that
was
discovered
doing
that
which
made
it
ashamed
of
itself
.
<EOS>
The
head
,
with
its
eyes
wide
open
,
held
its
own
,
and
seemed
to
say
,
 
"
Ay
,
 
I
've
caught
you
,
have
I
?
"
<EOS>
And
the
head
did
speak
,
though
not
exactly
in
those
words
.
<EOS>
"
Coosins
!
"
said
the
head
;
and
then
the
head
was
wagged
.
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
Lizzie
Eustace
,
whose
back
was
turned
to
the
head
,
raised
her
own
,
and
looked
up
into
Greystock
's
eyes
for
love
.
<EOS>
She
perceived
at
once
that
something
was
amiss
,
and
,
starting
to
her
feet
,
turned
quickly
round
.
"
<EOS>
How
dare
you
intrude
here
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
said
to
the
head
.
"
<EOS>
Coosins
!
"
replied
the
head
,
wagging
itself
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
clearly
necessary
that
Greystock
should
take
some
steps
,
if
only
with
the
object
of
proving
to
the
impudent
factotum
that
he
was
not
altogether
overcome
by
the
awkwardness
of
his
position
.
<EOS>
That
he
was
a
good
deal
annoyed
,
and
that
he
felt
not
altogether
quite
equal
to
the
occasion
,
must
be
acknowledged
.
<EOS>
"
What
is
it
that
the
man
wants
?
<EOS>
"
he
said
,
glaring
at
the
head
.
"
<EOS>
Coosins
!
<EOS>
"
said
the
head
,
wagging
itself
again
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
do
n't
take
yourself
off
,
I
shall
have
to
thrash
you
,
"
said
Frank
.
<EOS>
"
Coosins
!
"
said
Andy
Gowran
,
stepping
from
behind
the
rock
and
showing
his
full
figure
.
<EOS>
Andy
was
a
man
on
the
wrong
side
of
fifty
,
and
therefore
,
on
the
score
of
age
,
hardly
fit
for
thrashing
.
<EOS>
And
he
was
compact
,
short
,
broad
,
and
as
hard
as
flint
;
 
a
man
bad
to
thrash
,
look
at
it
from
what
side
you
would
.
<EOS>
"
Coosins
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
yet
again
.
"
<EOS>
Ye're
mair
couthie
than
coosinly
<EOS>
,
I
'm
thinking
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Andy
Gowran
,
I
dismiss
you
from
my
service
for
your
impertinence
,
"
said
Lady
Eustace
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
ae
ane
to
Andy
Gowran
for
that
,
my
leddie
.
<EOS>
There
's
timber
and
a
warld
<EOS>
o

<EOS>
things
aboot
the
place
as
wants
proteection
on

o

.
<EOS>
If
your
leddieship
is
minded
to
be
quit
o
'
my
sarvices
,
I
'll
find
a
maister
in
Mr.
Camperdoon
<EOS>
,
as'll
nae
alloo

thrown
out

<EOS>
Coosins
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Walk
off
from
this
!
"
said
Frank
Greystock
,
coming
forward
and
putting
his
hand
upon
the
man
's
breast
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Gowran
repeated
the
objectionable
word
yet
once
again
,
and
then
retired
.
  
<EOS>
Frank
Greystock
immediately
felt
how
very
bad
for
him
was
his
position
.
<EOS>
For
the
lady
,
if
only
she
could
succeed
in
her
object
,
the
annoyance
of
the
interruption
would
not
matter
much
after
its
first
absurdity
had
been
endured
.
<EOS>
When
she
had
become
the
wife
of
Frank
Greystock
there
would
be
nothing
remarkable
in
the
fact
that
she
had
been
found
sitting
with
him
in
a
cavern
by
the
sea
-
shore
.
<EOS>
But
for
Frank
the
difficulty
of
extricating
himself
from
his
dilemma
was
great
,
not
in
regard
to
Mr.
Gowran
,
but
in
reference
to
his
cousin
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
He
might
,
it
was
true
,
tell
her
that
he
was
engaged
to
Lucy
Morris
;
 
but
then
why
had
he
not
told
her
so
before
?
<EOS>
He
had
not
told
her
so
;
 
nor
did
he
tell
her
on
this
occasion
.
<EOS>
When
he
attempted
to
lead
her
away
up
the
cliff
,
she
insisted
on
being
left
where
she
was
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
find
my
way
alone
,
"
she
said
,
endeavouring
to
smile
through
her
tears
.
<EOS>
"
The
man
has
annoyed
me
by
his
impudence
,
 
that
is
all
.
<EOS>
Go
,
 
if
you
are
going
.
"
  
<EOS>
Of
course
he
was
going
;
but
he
could
not
go
without
a
word
of
tenderness
.
<EOS>
"
Dear
,
dear
Lizzie
,
"
he
said
,
embracing
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Frank
,
you
'll
be
true
to
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
be
true
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
go
now
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
And
he
went
his
way
up
the
cliff
,
and
got
his
pony
,
and
rode
back
to
the
cottage
,
very
uneasy
in
his
mind
.
   
<EOS>
Lucy
Morris
<EOS>
Misbehaves
 
<EOS>
Lucy
Morris
got
her
letter
and
was
contented
.
<EOS>
She
wanted
some
demonstration
of
love
from
her
lover
,
but
very
little
sufficed
for
her
comfort
.
<EOS>
With
her
it
was
almost
impossible
that
a
man
should
be
loved
and
suspected
at
the
same
time
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
have
loved
the
man
,
or
at
any
rate
confessed
her
love
,
without
thinking
well
of
him
;
and
she
could
not
think
good
and
evil
at
the
same
time
.
<EOS>
She
had
longed
for
some
word
from
him
since
she
last
saw
him
;
and
now
she
had
got
a
word
.
<EOS>
She
had
known
that
he
was
close
to
his
fair
cousin
,
 
the
cousin
whom
she
despised
,
and
whom
,
with
womanly
instinct
,
she
had
almost
regarded
as
a
rival
.
<EOS>
But
to
her
the
man
had
spoken
out
;
and
though
he
was
far
away
from
her
,
living
close
to
the
fair
cousin
,
she
would
not
allow
a
thought
of
trouble
on
that
score
to
annoy
her
.
<EOS>
He
was
her
own
,
and
let
Lizzie
Eustace
do
her
worst
,
he
would
remain
her
own
.
<EOS>
But
she
had
longed
to
be
told
that
he
was
thinking
of
her
,
and
at
last
the
letter
had
come
.
<EOS>
She
answered
it
that
same
night
with
the
sweetest
,
prettiest
little
letter
,
very
short
,
full
of
love
and
full
of
confidence
.
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
,
she
said
,
was
the
dearest
of
women
;
 
but
what
was
Lady
Fawn
to
her
,
or
all
the
Fawns
,
compared
with
her
lover
?
<EOS>
If
he
could
come
to
Richmond
without
disturbance
to
himself
,
let
him
come
;
but
if
he
felt
that
,
in
the
present
unhappy
condition
of
affairs
between
him
and
Lord
Fawn
,
it
was
better
that
he
should
stay
away
,
she
had
not
a
word
to
say
in
the
way
of
urging
him
.
<EOS>
To
see
him
would
be
a
great
delight
.
<EOS>
But
had
she
not
the
greater
delight
of
knowing
that
he
loved
her
?
<EOS>
That
was
quite
enough
to
make
her
happy
.
<EOS>
Then
there
was
a
little
prayer
that
God
might
bless
him
,
and
an
assurance
that
she
was
in
all
things
his
own
,
own
Lucy
.
<EOS>
When
she
was
writing
her
letter
<EOS>
she
was
in
all
respects
a
happy
girl
.
  
<EOS>
But
on
the
very
next
day
there
came
a
cloud
upon
her
happiness
,
 
not
in
the
least
,
however
,
affecting
her
full
confidence
in
her
lover
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
Saturday
,
and
Lord
Fawn
came
down
to
Richmond
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
had
seen
Mr.
Greystock
in
London
on
that
day
,
and
the
interview
had
been
by
no
means
pleasant
to
him
.
<EOS>
The
Under
-
Secretary
of
State
for
India
was
as
dark
as
a
November
day
when
he
reached
his
mother
's
house
,
and
there
fell
upon
every
one
the
unintermittent
cold
drizzling
shower
of
his
displeasure
from
the
moment
in
which
he
entered
the
house
.
<EOS>
There
was
never
much
reticence
among
the
ladies
at
Richmond
in
Lucy
's
presence
,
and
since
the
completion
of
Lizzie
's
unfortunate
visit
to
Fawn
Court
,
they
had
not
hesitated
to
express
open
opinions
adverse
to
the
prospects
of
the
proposed
bride
.
<EOS>
Lucy
herself
could
say
<EOS>
but
little
in
defence
of
her
old
friend
,
who
had
lost
all
claim
upon
that
friendship
since
the
offer
of
the
bribe
had
been
made
,
 
so
that
it
was
understood
among
them
all
that
Lizzie
was
to
be
regarded
as
a
black
sheep
;
 
but
hitherto
Lord
Fawn
himself
had
concealed
his
feelings
before
Lucy
.
<EOS>
Now
unfortunately
he
spoke
out
,
and
in
speaking
was
especially
bitter
against
Frank
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Greystock
has
been
most
insolent
,
"
he
said
as
they
were
all
sitting
together
in
the
library
after
dinner
.
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
made
a
sign
to
him
and
shook
her
head
.
<EOS>
Lucy
felt
the
hot
blood
fly
into
both
her
cheeks
,
but
at
the
moment
she
did
not
speak
.
<EOS>
Lydia
Fawn
put
out
her
hand
beneath
the
table
and
took
hold
of
Lucy
's
.
<EOS>
"
We
must
all
remember
that
he
is
her
cousin
,
"
said
Augusta
.
  
<EOS>
"
His
relationship
to
Lady
Eustace
can
not
justify
ungentlemanlike
impertinence
to
me
,
"
said
Lord
Fawn
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
has
dared
to
use
words
to
me
which
would
make
it
necessary
that
I
should
call
him
out
,
only
 
"
  
"
Frederic
,
you
shall
do
nothing
of
the
kind
!
"
said
Lady
Fawn
,
jumping
up
from
her
chair
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Frederic
,
pray
,
pray
do
n't
!
"
<EOS>
said
Augusta
,
springing
on
to
her
brother
's
shoulder
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
Frederic
does
not
mean
that
,
"
said
Amelia
.
  
<EOS>
"
Only
that
nobody
does
call
any
body
out
now
,
"
added
the
pacific
lord
.
"
<EOS>
But
nothing
on
earth
shall
ever
induce
me
to
speak
again
to
a
man
who
is
so
little
like
a
gentleman
.
<EOS>
"
Lydia
now
held
Lucy
's
hand
still
tighter
,
as
though
to
prevent
her
rising
.
<EOS>
"
He
has
never
forgiven
me
,
"
continued
Lord
Fawn
,
"
because
he
was
so
ridiculously
wrong
about
the
Sawab
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
,
"
said
Lucy
.
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Morris
,
I
shall
venture
to
hold
my
own
opinion
,
"
said
Lord
Fawn
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
shall
hold
mine
,
"
said
Lucy
bravely
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
Sawab
of
Mygawb
had
nothing
to
do
with
what
Mr.
Greystock
may
have
said
or
done
about
his
cousin
.
<EOS>
I
am
quite
sure
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Lucy
,
you
are
forgetting
yourself
,
"
said
Lady
Fawn
.
  
<EOS>
"
Lucy
,
dear
,
you
should
n't
contradict
my
brother
,
"
said
Augusta
.
  
<EOS>
"
Take
my
advice
,
Lucy
,
and
let
it
pass
by
,
"
said
Amelia
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
can
I
hear
such
things
said
and
not
notice
them
?
"
demanded
Lucy
.
<EOS>
"
Why
does
Lord
Fawn
say
them
when
I
am
by
?
"
  
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
had
now
condescended
to
be
full
of
wrath
against
his
mother
's
governess
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I
suppose
I
may
express
my
own
opinion
,
Miss
Morris
,
in
my
mother
's
house
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
I
shall
express
mine
,
"
said
Lucy
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Greystock
is
a
gentleman
.
<EOS>
If
you
say
that
he
is
not
a
gentleman
,
it
is
not
true
.
"
<EOS>
Upon
hearing
these
terrible
words
spoken
,
Lord
Fawn
rose
from
his
seat
and
slowly
left
the
room
.
<EOS>
Augusta
followed
him
with
both
her
arms
stretched
out
.
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
,
and
even
Amelia
was
dismayed
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Lucy
!
<EOS>
why
could
you
not
hold
your
tongue
?
"
said
Lydia
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wo
n't
hold
my
tongue
!
"
<EOS>
said
Lucy
,
bursting
out
into
tears
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
is
a
gentleman
.
"
  
<EOS>
Then
there
was
great
commotion
at
Fawn
Court
.
<EOS>
After
a
few
moments
Lady
Fawn
followed
her
son
without
having
said
a
word
to
Lucy
,
and
Amelia
went
with
her
.
<EOS>
Poor
Lucy
was
left
with
the
younger
girls
,
and
was
no
doubt
very
unhappy
.
<EOS>
But
she
was
still
indignant
,
and
would
yield
nothing
.
<EOS>
When
Georgina
,
the
fourth
daughter
,
pointed
out
to
her
that
,
in
accordance
with
all
rules
of
good
breeding
,
she
should
have
abstained
from
asserting
that
her
brother
had
spoken
an
untruth
,
she
blazed
up
again
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
untrue
,
"
she
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
,
Lucy
,
people
never
accuse
each
other
of
untruth
.
<EOS>
No
lady
should
use
such
a
word
to
a
gentleman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
should
not
have
said
so
.
<EOS>
He
knows
that
Mr.
Greystock
is
more
to
me
than
all
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
had
a
lover
,
"
said
Nina
,
"
and
anybody
were
to
say
a
word
against
him
,
<EOS>
I
know
I
'd
fly
at
them
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
why
Frederic
is
to
have
it
all
his
own
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nina
,
you
're
a
fool
,
"
said
Diana
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
think
it
was
very
hard
for
Lucy
to
bear
,
"
said
Lydia
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
wo
n't
bear
it
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Lucy
.
<EOS>
"
To
think
that
Mr.
Greystock
should
be
so
mean
as
to
bear
malice
about
a
thing
like
that
wild
Indian
because
he
takes
his
own
cousin
's
part
!
<EOS>
Of
course
I
'd
better
go
away
.
<EOS>
You
all
think
that
Mr.
Greystock
is
an
enemy
now
;
but
he
never
can
be
an
enemy
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
think
that
Lady
Eustace
is
an
enemy
,
"
said
Cecilia
,
"
and
a
very
nasty
enemy
,
too
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
not
say
a
word
about
Lady
Eustace
,
"
said
Lucy
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
Mr.
Greystock
is
a
gentleman
.
<EOS>
"
  
About
an
hour
after
this
Lady
Fawn
sent
for
Lucy
,
and
the
two
were
closeted
together
for
a
long
time
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
was
very
angry
,
and
had
hitherto
altogether
declined
to
overlook
the
insult
offered
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
bound
to
tell
you
,
"
declared
Lady
Fawn
,
with
much
emphasis
,
"
that
nothing
can
justify
you
in
having
accused
Lord
Fawn
of
telling
an
untruth
.
<EOS>
Of
course
,
I
was
sorry
that
Mr.
Greystock
's
name
should
have
been
mentioned
in
your
presence
;
but
as
it
was
mentioned
,
you
should
have
borne
what
was
said
with
patience
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
could
n't
be
patient
,
Lady
Fawn
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
what
wicked
people
say
when
they
commit
murder
,
and
then
they
are
hung
for
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
go
away
,
Lady
Fawn
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
That
is
ungrateful
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
You
know
that
I
do
n't
wish
you
to
go
away
.
<EOS>
But
if
you
behave
badly
,
of
course
I
must
tell
you
of
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'd
sooner
go
away
.
<EOS>
Everybody
here
thinks
ill
of
Mr.
Greystock
.
<EOS>
But
I
do
n't
think
ill
of
Mr.
Greystock
,
and
I
never
shall
.
<EOS>
Why
did
Lord
Fawn
say
such
very
hard
things
about
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
suggested
to
her
that
she
should
be
down
-
stairs
early
the
next
morning
,
and
apologise
to
Lord
Fawn
for
her
rudeness
;
but
she
would
not
,
on
that
night
,
undertake
to
do
any
such
thing
.
<EOS>
Let
Lady
Fawn
say
what
she
might
,
Lucy
thought
that
the
injury
had
been
done
to
her
,
and
not
to
his
lordship
.
<EOS>
And
so
they
parted
hardly
friends
.
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
gave
her
no
kiss
as
she
went
,
and
Lucy
,
with
obstinate
pride
,
altogether
refused
to
own
her
fault
.
<EOS>
She
would
only
say
that
she
had
better
go
,
and
when
Lady
Fawn
over
and
over
again
pointed
out
to
her
that
the
last
thing
that
such
a
one
as
Lord
Fawn
could
bear
was
to
be
accused
of
an
untruth
,
she
would
continue
to
say
that
in
that
case
he
should
be
careful
to
say
nothing
that
was
untrue
.
<EOS>
All
this
was
very
dreadful
,
and
created
great
confusion
and
unhappiness
at
Fawn
Court
.
<EOS>
Lydia
came
into
her
room
that
night
,
and
the
two
girls
talked
the
matter
over
for
hours
.
<EOS>
In
the
morning
Lucy
was
up
early
,
and
found
Lord
Fawn
walking
in
the
grounds
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
told
that
he
would
probably
be
found
walking
in
the
grounds
,
if
she
were
willing
to
tender
to
him
any
apology
.
  
<EOS>
Her
mind
had
been
very
full
of
the
subject
,
 
not
only
in
reference
to
her
lover
,
but
as
it
regarded
her
own
conduct
.
<EOS>
One
of
the
elder
Fawn
girls
had
assured
her
that
under
no
circumstances
could
a
lady
be
justified
in
telling
a
gentleman
that
he
had
spoken
an
untruth
,
and
she
was
not
quite
sure
but
that
the
law
so
laid
down
was
right
.
<EOS>
And
then
she
could
not
but
remember
that
the
gentleman
in
question
was
Lord
Fawn
,
and
that
she
was
Lady
Fawn
's
governess
.
<EOS>
But
Mr.
Greystock
was
her
affianced
lover
,
and
her
first
duty
was
to
him
.
<EOS>
And
then
,
granting
that
she
herself
had
been
wrong
in
accusing
Lord
Fawn
of
untruth
,
she
could
not
refrain
from
asking
herself
whether
he
had
not
been
much
more
wrong
in
saying
in
her
hearing
that
Mr.
Greystock
was
not
a
gentleman
?
<EOS>
And
his
offence
had
preceded
her
offence
,
and
had
caused
it
!
<EOS>
She
hardly
knew
whether
she
did
or
did
not
owe
an
apology
to
Lord
Fawn
,
but
she
was
quite
sure
that
Lord
Fawn
owed
an
apology
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
She
walked
straight
up
to
Lord
Fawn
,
and
met
him
beneath
the
trees
.
<EOS>
He
was
still
black
and
solemn
,
and
was
evidently
brooding
over
his
grievance
;
but
he
bowed
to
her
,
and
stood
still
as
she
approached
him
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
lord
,
"
said
she
,
"
I
am
very
sorry
for
what
happened
last
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
so
was
I
,
 
very
sorry
,
Miss
Morris
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
know
that
I
am
engaged
to
marry
Mr.
Greystock
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
allow
that
that
has
anything
to
do
with
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
When
you
think
that
he
must
be
dearer
to
me
than
all
the
world
,
you
will
acknowledge
that
I
could
n't
hear
hard
things
said
of
him
without
speaking
.
"
<EOS>
His
face
became
blacker
than
ever
,
but
he
made
no
reply
.
<EOS>
He
wanted
an
abject
begging
of
unconditional
pardon
from
the
little
girl
who
loved
his
enemy
.
<EOS>
If
that
were
done
,
he
would
vouchsafe
his
forgiveness
;
but
he
was
too
small
by
nature
to
grant
it
on
other
terms
.
<EOS>
"
Of
course
,
"
continued
Lucy
,
"
I
am
bound
to
treat
you
with
special
respect
in
Lady
Fawn
's
house
.
<EOS>
"
She
looked
almost
beseechingly
into
his
face
as
she
paused
for
a
moment
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
treated
me
with
especial
disrespect
,
"
said
Lord
Fawn
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
how
did
you
treat
me
,
Lord
Fawn
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Morris
,
I
must
be
allowed
,
in
discussing
matters
with
my
mother
,
to
express
my
own
opinions
in
such
language
as
I
may
think
fit
to
use
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Greystock
's
conduct
to
me
was
 
<EOS>
was
 
<EOS>
was
altogether
most
ungentlemanlike
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Greystock
is
a
gentleman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
His
conduct
was
most
offensive
,
and
most
 
most
ungentlemanlike
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Greystock
disgraced
himself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
n't
true
!
"
said
Lucy
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
gave
one
start
,
and
then
walked
off
to
the
house
as
quick
as
his
legs
could
carry
him
.
   
<EOS>
Mr.
Dove
in
His
Chambers
 
<EOS>
The
scene
between
Lord
Fawn
and
Greystock
had
taken
place
in
Mr.
Camperdown
's
chambers
,
and
John
Eustace
had
also
been
present
.
<EOS>
The
lawyer
had
suffered
considerable
annoyance
,
before
the
arrival
of
the
two
first
-
named
gentlemen
,
from
reiterated
assertions
made
by
Eustace
that
he
would
take
no
further
trouble
whatsoever
about
the
jewels
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Camperdown
had
in
vain
pointed
out
to
him
that
a
plain
duty
lay
upon
him
as
executor
and
guardian
to
protect
the
property
on
behalf
of
his
nephew
;
but
Eustace
had
asserted
that
,
though
he
himself
was
comparatively
a
poor
man
,
he
would
sooner
replace
the
necklace
out
of
his
own
property
,
than
be
subject
to
the
nuisance
of
such
a
continued
quarrel
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
John
;
ten
thousand
pounds
!
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Camperdown
had
said
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
fortune
for
a
younger
son
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
boy
is
only
two
years
old
,
and
will
have
time
enough
to
make
fortunes
for
his
own
younger
sons
,
if
he
does
not
squander
everything
.
<EOS>
If
he
does
,
the
ten
thousand
pounds
will
make
no
difference
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
But
the
justice
of
the
thing
,
John
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Justice
may
be
purchased
too
dearly
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Such
a
harpy
as
she
is
,
too
!
<EOS>
"
pleaded
the
lawyer
.
<EOS>
Then
Lord
Fawn
had
come
in
,
and
Greystock
had
followed
immediately
afterwards
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
may
as
well
say
at
once
,
"
said
Greystock
,
"
that
Lady
Eustace
is
determined
to
maintain
her
right
to
the
property
;
and
that
she
will
not
give
up
the
diamonds
till
some
adequate
court
of
law
shall
have
decided
that
she
is
mistaken
in
her
views
.
<EOS>
Stop
one
moment
,
Mr.
Camperdown
.
<EOS>
I
feel
myself
bound
to
go
further
than
that
,
and
express
my
own
opinion
that
she
is
right
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
hardly
understand
such
an
opinion
as
coming
from
you
,
"
said
Mr.
Camperdown
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
changed
your
mind
,
at
any
rate
,
"
said
John
Eustace
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
so
,
Eustace
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Camperdown
,
you
'll
be
good
enough
to
understand
that
my
opinion
expressed
here
<EOS>
is
that
of
a
friend
,
and
not
that
of
a
lawyer
.
<EOS>
And
you
must
understand
,
Eustace
,
"
continued
Greystock
,
"
that
I
am
speaking
now
of
my
cousin
's
right
to
the
property
.
<EOS>
Though
the
value
be
great
,
I
have
advised
her
to
give
up
the
custody
of
it
for
a
while
,
till
the
matter
shall
be
clearly
decided
.
<EOS>
That
has
still
been
my
advice
to
her
,
and
I
have
in
no
respect
changed
my
mind
.
<EOS>
But
she
feels
that
she
is
being
cruelly
used
,
and
with
a
woman
's
spirit
will
not
,
in
such
circumstances
,
yield
anything
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Camperdown
actually
stopped
her
carriage
in
the
street
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
would
not
answer
a
line
that
anybody
wrote
to
her
,
"
said
the
lawyer
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
may
say
plainly
,
 
for
all
here
<EOS>
know
the
circumstances
,
 
that
Lady
Eustace
feels
the
strongest
possible
indignation
at
the
manner
in
which
she
is
being
treated
by
Lord
Fawn
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
only
asked
her
to
give
up
the
diamonds
till
the
question
should
be
settled
,
"
said
Lord
Fawn
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
backed
your
request
,
my
lord
,
by
a
threat
!
<EOS>
My
cousin
is
naturally
most
indignant
;
and
,
my
lord
,
you
must
allow
me
to
tell
you
that
I
fully
share
the
feeling
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
no
use
in
making
a
quarrel
about
it
,
"
said
Eustace
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
quarrel
is
already
made
,
"
replied
Greystock
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
here
to
tell
Lord
Fawn
in
your
presence
,
and
in
the
presence
of
Mr.
Camperdown
,
that
he
is
behaving
to
a
lady
with
ill
-
usage
,
which
he
would
not
dare
to
exercise
<EOS>
did
he
not
know
that
her
position
saves
him
from
legal
punishment
,
as
do
the
present
usages
of
society
from
other
consequences
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
behaved
to
her
with
every
possible
consideration
,
"
said
Lord
Fawn
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
a
simple
assertion
,
"
said
the
other
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
made
one
assertion
,
and
you
have
made
another
.
<EOS>
The
world
will
have
to
judge
between
us
.
<EOS>
What
right
have
you
to
take
upon
yourself
to
decide
whether
this
thing
or
that
belongs
to
Lady
Eustace
or
to
any
one
else
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
When
the
thing
was
talked
about
I
was
obliged
to
have
an
opinion
,
"
said
Lord
Fawn
,
who
was
still
thinking
of
words
in
which
to
reply
to
the
insult
offered
him
by
Greystock
without
injury
to
his
dignity
as
an
Under
-
Secretary
of
State
.
  
<EOS>
"
Your
conduct
,
sir
,
has
been
altogether
inexcusable
.
"
<EOS>
Then
Frank
turned
to
the
attorney
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
given
to
understand
that
you
are
desirous
of
knowing
where
this
diamond
necklace
is
at
present
.
<EOS>
It
is
at
Lady
Eustace
's
house
in
Scotland
;
 
at
Portray
Castle
.
<EOS>
"
Then
he
shook
hands
with
John
Eustace
,
bowed
to
Mr.
Camperdown
,
and
succeeded
in
leaving
the
room
before
Lord
Fawn
had
so
far
collected
his
senses
as
to
be
able
to
frame
his
anger
into
definite
words
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
never
willingly
speak
to
that
man
again
,
"
said
Lord
Fawn
.
<EOS>
But
as
it
was
not
probable
that
Greystock
would
greatly
desire
any
further
conversation
with
Lord
Fawn
,
this
threat
did
not
carry
with
it
any
powerful
feeling
of
severity
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Camperdown
groaned
over
the
matter
with
thorough
vexation
of
spirit
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
to
him
as
though
the
harpy
,
as
he
called
her
,
would
really
make
good
her
case
against
him
,
 
at
any
rate
,
would
make
it
seem
to
be
good
for
so
long
a
time
that
all
the
triumph
of
success
would
be
hers
.
<EOS>
He
knew
that
she
was
already
in
debt
,
and
gave
her
credit
for
a
propensity
to
fast
living
which
almost
did
her
an
injustice
.
<EOS>
Of
course
,
the
jewels
would
be
sold
for
half
their
value
,
and
the
harpy
would
triumph
.
<EOS>
Of
what
use
to
him
or
to
the
estate
would
be
a
decision
of
the
courts
in
his
favour
when
the
diamonds
should
have
been
broken
up
and
scattered
to
the
winds
of
heaven
?
<EOS>
Ten
thousand
pounds
!
<EOS>
It
was
,
to
Mr.
Camperdown
's
mind
,
a
thing
quite
terrible
that
,
in
a
country
which
boasts
of
its
laws
and
of
the
execution
of
its
laws
,
such
an
impostor
as
was
this
widow
should
be
able
to
lay
her
dirty
,
grasping
fingers
on
so
great
an
amount
of
property
,
and
that
there
should
be
no
means
of
punishing
her
.
<EOS>
That
Lizzie
Eustace
had
stolen
the
diamonds
,
as
a
pickpocket
steals
a
watch
,
was
a
fact
as
to
which
Mr.
Camperdown
had
in
his
mind
no
shadow
of
a
doubt
.
<EOS>
And
,
as
the
reader
knows
,
he
was
right
.
<EOS>
She
had
stolen
them
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Camperdown
knew
that
she
had
stolen
them
,
and
was
a
wretched
man
.
<EOS>
From
the
first
moment
of
the
late
Sir
Florian
's
infatuation
about
this
woman
,
she
had
worked
woe
for
Mr.
Camperdown
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Camperdown
had
striven
hard
,
 
to
the
great
and
almost
permanent
offence
of
Sir
Florian
,
 
to
save
Portray
from
its
present
condition
of
degradation
;
but
he
had
striven
in
vain
.
<EOS>
Portray
belonged
to
the
harpy
for
her
life
;
and
moreover
,
he
himself
had
been
forced
to
be
instrumental
in
paying
over
to
the
harpy
a
large
sum
of
Eustace
money
almost
immediately
on
her
becoming
a
widow
.
<EOS>
Then
had
come
the
affair
of
the
diamonds
;
 
an
affair
of
ten
thousand
pounds
!
 
<EOS>
as
Mr.
Camperdown
would
exclaim
to
himself
,
throwing
his
eyes
up
to
the
ceiling
.
<EOS>
And
now
it
seemed
that
she
was
to
get
the
better
of
him
even
in
that
,
although
there
could
not
be
a
shadow
of
doubt
as
to
her
falsehood
and
fraudulent
dishonesty
!
<EOS>
His
luck
in
the
matter
was
so
bad
!
<EOS>
John
Eustace
had
no
backbone
,
no
spirit
,
no
proper
feeling
as
to
his
own
family
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
was
as
weak
as
water
,
and
almost
disgraced
the
cause
by
the
accident
of
his
adherence
to
it
.
<EOS>
Greystock
,
who
would
have
been
a
tower
of
strength
,
had
turned
against
him
,
and
was
now
prepared
to
maintain
that
the
harpy
was
right
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Camperdown
knew
that
the
harpy
was
wrong
,
 
that
she
was
a
harpy
,
and
he
would
not
abandon
the
cause
;
but
the
difficulties
in
his
way
were
great
,
and
the
annoyance
to
which
he
was
subjected
was
excessive
.
<EOS>
His
wife
and
daughters
were
still
at
Dawlish
,
and
he
was
up
in
town
in
September
,
simply
because
the
harpy
had
the
present
possession
of
these
diamonds
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Camperdown
was
a
man
turned
sixty
,
handsome
,
grey
-
haired
,
healthy
,
somewhat
florid
,
and
carrying
in
his
face
and
person
external
signs
of
prosperity
and
that
kind
of
self
-
assertion
which
prosperity
always
produces
.
<EOS>
But
they
who
knew
him
best
were
aware
that
he
did
not
bear
trouble
well
.
<EOS>
In
any
trouble
,
such
as
was
this
about
the
necklace
,
there
would
come
over
his
face
a
look
of
weakness
which
betrayed
the
want
of
real
inner
strength
.
<EOS>
How
many
faces
one
sees
which
,
in
ordinary
circumstances
,
are
comfortable
,
self
-
asserting
,
sufficient
,
and
even
bold
;
the
lines
of
which
,
under
difficulties
,
collapse
and
become
mean
,
spiritless
,
and
insignificant
.
<EOS>
There
are
faces
which
,
in
their
usual
form
,
seem
to
bluster
with
prosperity
,
but
which
the
loss
of
a
dozen
points
at
whist
will
reduce
to
that
currish
aspect
which
reminds
one
of
a
dog
-
whip
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Camperdown
's
countenance
,
when
Lord
Fawn
and
Mr.
Eustace
left
him
,
had
fallen
away
into
this
meanness
of
appearance
.
<EOS>
He
no
longer
carried
himself
as
a
man
owning
a
dog
-
whip
,
but
rather
as
the
hound
that
feared
it
.
  
<EOS>
A
better
attorney
,
for
the
purposes
to
which
his
life
was
devoted
,
did
not
exist
in
London
than
Mr.
Camperdown
.
<EOS>
To
say
that
he
was
honest
,
is
nothing
.
<EOS>
To
describe
him
simply
as
zealous
,
would
be
to
fall
very
short
of
his
merits
.
<EOS>
The
interests
of
his
clients
were
his
own
interests
,
and
the
legal
rights
of
the
properties
of
which
he
had
the
legal
charge
,
were
as
dear
to
him
as
his
own
blood
.
<EOS>
But
it
could
not
be
said
of
him
that
he
was
a
learned
lawyer
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
in
that
branch
of
a
solicitor
's
profession
in
which
he
had
been
called
upon
to
work
,
experience
goes
further
than
learning
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
doubted
,
indeed
,
whether
it
is
not
so
in
every
branch
of
every
profession
.
<EOS>
But
it
might
,
perhaps
,
have
been
better
for
Mr.
Camperdown
<EOS>
had
he
devoted
more
hours
of
his
youth
to
reading
books
on
conveyancing
.
<EOS>
He
was
now
too
old
for
such
studies
,
and
could
trust
only
to
the
reading
of
other
people
.
<EOS>
The
reading
,
however
,
of
other
people
was
always
at
his
command
,
and
his
clients
were
rich
men
who
did
not
mind
paying
for
an
opinion
.
<EOS>
To
have
an
opinion
from
Mr.
Dove
,
or
some
other
learned
gentleman
,
was
the
every
-
day
practice
of
his
life
;
and
when
he
obtained
,
as
he
often
did
,
little
coigns
of
legal
vantage
and
subtle
definitions
as
to
property
which
were
comfortable
to
him
,
he
would
rejoice
to
think
that
he
could
always
have
a
Dove
at
his
hand
to
tell
him
exactly
how
far
he
was
justified
in
going
in
defence
of
his
clients
"
interests
.
<EOS>
But
now
there
had
come
to
him
no
comfort
from
his
corner
of
legal
knowledge
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Dove
had
taken
extraordinary
pains
in
the
matter
,
and
had
simply
succeeded
in
throwing
over
his
employer
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
necklace
ca
n't
be
an
heirloom
!
"
said
Mr.
Camperdown
to
himself
,
telling
off
on
his
fingers
half
-
a
-
dozen
instances
in
which
he
had
either
known
or
had
heard
that
the
head
of
a
family
had
so
arranged
the
future
possession
of
the
family
jewels
.
<EOS>
Then
he
again
read
Mr.
Dove
's
opinion
,
and
actually
took
a
law
-
book
off
his
shelves
with
the
view
of
testing
the
correctness
of
the
barrister
in
reference
to
some
special
assertion
.
<EOS>
A
pot
or
a
pan
might
be
an
heirloom
,
but
not
a
necklace
!
<EOS>
Mr.
Camperdown
could
hardly
bring
himself
to
believe
that
this
was
law
.
<EOS>
And
then
as
to
paraphernalia
!
<EOS>
Up
to
this
moment
,
though
he
had
been
called
upon
to
arrange
great
dealings
in
reference
to
widows
,
he
had
never
as
yet
heard
of
a
claim
made
by
a
widow
for
paraphernalia
.
<EOS>
But
then
the
widows
with
whom
he
had
been
called
upon
to
deal
,
had
been
ladies
quite
content
to
accept
the
good
things
settled
upon
them
by
the
liberal
prudence
of
their
friends
and
husbands
,
 
not
greedy
,
blood
-
sucking
harpies
such
as
this
Lady
Eustace
.
<EOS>
It
was
quite
terrible
to
Mr.
Camperdown
that
one
of
his
clients
should
have
fallen
into
such
a
pit
.
<EOS>
Mors
omnibus
est
communis
.
<EOS>
But
to
have
left
such
a
widow
behind
one
!
  
<EOS>
"
John
,
"
he
said
,
opening
his
door
.
<EOS>
John
was
his
son
and
partner
,
and
John
came
to
him
,
having
been
summoned
by
a
clerk
from
another
room
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Just
shut
the
door
.
<EOS>
I
've
had
such
a
scene
here
;
 
Lord
Fawn
and
Mr.
Greystock
almost
coming
to
blows
about
that
horrid
woman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
Upper
House
would
have
got
the
worst
of
it
,
as
it
usually
does
,
"
said
the
younger
attorney
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
there
is
John
Eustace
cares
no
more
what
becomes
of
the
property
than
if
he
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
;
 
<EOS>
absolutely
talks
of
replacing
the
diamonds
out
of
his
own
pocket
;
a
man
whose
personal
interest
in
the
estate
is
by
no
means
equal
to
her
own
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
would
n't
do
it
,
you
know
,
"
said
Camperdown
Junior
,
who
did
not
know
the
family
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
just
what
he
would
do
,
"
said
the
father
,
who
did
.
<EOS>
"
There
's
nothing
they
would
n't
give
away
when
once
the
idea
takes
them
.
<EOS>
Think
of
that
woman
having
the
whole
Portray
estate
,
perhaps
for
the
next
sixty
years
,
 
nearly
the
fee
-
simple
of
the
property
,
 
just
because
she
made
eyes
to
Sir
Florian
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
done
and
gone
,
father
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
here
's
<EOS>
Dove
tells
us
that
a
necklace
ca
n't
be
an
heirloom
,
unless
it
belongs
to
the
Crown
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Whatever
he
says
,
you
'd
better
take
his
word
for
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
not
so
sure
of
that
.
<EOS>
It
ca
n't
be
.
<EOS>
I
'll
tell
you
what
I
'll
do
.
<EOS>
I
'll
go
over
and
see
him
.
<EOS>
We
can
file
a
bill
in
Chancery
,
I
do
n't
doubt
,
and
prove
that
the
property
belongs
to
the
family
and
must
go
by
the
will
.
<EOS>
But
she
'll
sell
them
before
we
can
get
the
custody
of
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
she
has
done
that
already
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Greystock
says
they
are
at
Portray
,
and
I
believe
they
are
.
<EOS>
She
was
wearing
them
in
London
only
in
July
,
 
a
day
or
two
before
I
saw
her
as
she
was
leaving
town
.
<EOS>
If
anybody
like
a
jeweller
had
been
down
at
the
castle
,
I
should
have
heard
of
it
.
<EOS>
She
has
n't
sold
"
em
yet
,
but
she
will
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
could
do
that
just
the
same
if
they
were
an
heirloom
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
John
.
<EOS>
I
think
not
.
<EOS>
We
could
have
acted
much
more
quickly
,
and
have
frightened
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
were
you
,
father
,
I
'd
drop
the
matter
altogether
,
and
let
John
Eustace
replace
them
if
he
pleases
.
<EOS>
We
all
know
that
he
would
never
be
called
on
to
do
anything
of
the
kind
.
<EOS>
It
is
n't
our
sort
of
business
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
ten
thousand
pounds
!
"
said
Camperdown
Senior
,
to
whom
the
magnitude
of
the
larceny
almost
ennobled
the
otherwise
mean
duty
of
catching
the
thief
.
<EOS>
Then
Mr.
Camperdown
rose
,
and
slowly
walked
across
the
New
Square
,
Lincoln
's
Inn
,
under
the
low
archway
,
by
the
entrance
to
the
old
court
in
which
Lord
Eldon
used
to
sit
,
to
the
Old
Square
,
in
which
the
Turtle
Dove
had
built
his
legal
nest
on
a
first
floor
,
close
to
the
old
gateway
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Dove
was
a
gentleman
who
spent
a
very
great
portion
of
his
life
in
this
somewhat
gloomy
abode
of
learning
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
now
term
time
,
and
most
of
his
brethren
were
absent
from
London
,
recruiting
their
strength
among
the
Alps
,
or
drinking
in
vigours
for
fresh
campaigns
with
the
salt
sea
breezes
of
Kent
and
Sussex
,
or
perhaps
shooting
deer
in
Scotland
,
or
catching
fish
in
Connemara
.
<EOS>
But
Mr.
Dove
was
a
man
of
iron
,
who
wanted
no
such
recreation
.
<EOS>
To
be
absent
from
his
law
-
books
and
the
black
,
littered
,
ink
-
stained
old
table
on
which
he
was
wo
nt
to
write
his
opinions
,
was
,
to
him
,
to
be
wretched
.
<EOS>
The
only
exercise
necessary
to
him
was
that
of
putting
on
his
wig
and
going
into
one
of
the
courts
that
were
close
to
his
chambers
;
 
but
even
that
was
almost
distasteful
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
preferred
sitting
in
his
old
arm
-
chair
,
turning
over
his
old
books
in
search
of
old
cases
,
and
producing
opinions
which
he
would
be
prepared
to
back
against
all
the
world
of
Lincoln
's
Inn
.
<EOS>
He
and
Mr.
Camperdown
had
known
each
other
intimately
for
many
years
,
and
though
the
rank
of
the
two
men
in
their
profession
differed
much
,
they
were
able
to
discuss
questions
of
law
without
any
appreciation
of
that
difference
among
themselves
.
<EOS>
The
one
man
knew
much
,
and
the
other
little
;
the
one
was
not
only
learned
,
but
possessed
also
of
great
gifts
,
while
the
other
was
simply
an
ordinary
clear
-
headed
man
of
business
;
but
they
had
sympathies
in
common
which
made
them
friends
;
they
were
both
honest
and
unwilling
to
sell
their
services
to
dishonest
customers
;
and
they
equally
entertained
a
deep
-
rooted
contempt
for
that
portion
of
mankind
who
thought
that
property
could
be
managed
and
protected
without
the
intervention
of
lawyers
.
<EOS>
The
outside
world
to
them
was
a
world
of
pretty
,
laughing
,
ignorant
children
;
and
lawyers
were
the
parents
,
guardians
,
pastors
,
and
masters
by
whom
the
children
should
be
protected
from
the
evils
incident
to
their
childishness
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
;
he
's
here
,
"
said
the
Turtle
Dove
's
clerk
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
is
talking
of
going
away
,
but
he
wo
n't
go
.
<EOS>
He
's
told
me
I
can
have
a
week
,
but
I
do
n't
know
that
I
like
to
leave
him
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Dove
and
the
children
are
down
at
Ramsgate
,
and
he
's
here
all
night
.
<EOS>
He
had
n't
been
out
for
so
long
that
when
he
wanted
to
go
as
far
as
the
Temple
yesterday
,
we
could
n't
find
his
hat
.
"
<EOS>
Then
the
clerk
opened
the
door
,
and
ushered
Mr.
Camperdown
into
the
room
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Dove
was
the
younger
man
by
five
or
six
years
,
and
his
hair
was
still
black
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Camperdown
's
was
nearer
white
than
grey
;
but
,
nevertheless
,
Mr.
Camperdown
looked
as
though
he
were
the
younger
man
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Dove
was
a
long
,
thin
man
,
with
a
stoop
in
his
shoulders
,
with
deep
-
set
,
hollow
eyes
,
and
lanthorn
cheeks
,
and
sallow
complexion
,
with
long
,
thin
hands
,
who
seemed
to
acknowledge
by
every
movement
of
his
body
and
every
tone
of
his
voice
that
old
age
was
creeping
on
him
,
 
whereas
the
attorney
's
step
was
still
elastic
,
and
his
speech
brisk
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Camperdown
wore
a
blue
frock
-
coat
,
and
a
coloured
cravat
,
and
a
light
waistcoat
.
<EOS>
With
Mr.
Dove
every
visible
article
of
his
raiment
was
black
,
except
his
shirt
,
and
he
had
that
peculiar
blackness
which
a
man
achieves
when
he
wears
a
dress
-
coat
over
a
high
black
waistcoat
in
the
morning
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
did
n't
make
much
,
I
fear
,
of
what
I
sent
you
about
heirlooms
,
"
said
Mr.
Dove
,
divining
the
purport
of
Mr.
Camperdown
's
visit
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
great
deal
more
than
I
wanted
<EOS>
,
I
can
assure
you
,
Mr.
Dove
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
a
common
error
about
heirlooms
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
common
,
indeed
,
I
should
say
.
<EOS>
God
bless
my
soul
!
<EOS>
when
one
knows
how
often
the
word
occurs
in
family
deeds
,
it
does
startle
one
to
be
told
that
there
is
n't
any
such
thing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
I
said
quite
so
much
as
that
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
I
was
careful
to
point
out
that
the
law
does
acknowledge
heirlooms
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
But
not
diamonds
,
"
said
the
attorney
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
doubt
whether
I
went
quite
so
far
as
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Only
the
Crown
diamonds
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
I
ever
debarred
all
other
diamonds
.
<EOS>
A
diamond
in
a
star
of
honour
might
form
a
part
of
an
heirloom
;
but
I
do
not
think
that
a
diamond
itself
could
be
an
heirloom
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
in
a
star
of
honour
,
why
not
in
a
necklace
?
"
argued
Mr.
Camperdown
almost
triumphantly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Because
a
star
of
honour
,
unless
tampered
with
by
fraud
,
would
naturally
be
maintained
in
its
original
form
.
<EOS>
The
setting
of
a
necklace
will
probably
be
altered
from
generation
to
generation
.
<EOS>
The
one
,
like
a
picture
or
a
precious
piece
of
furniture
,
 
"
  
"
Or
a
pot
or
a
pan
,
"
said
Mr.
Camperdown
,
with
sarcasm
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pots
and
pans
may
be
precious
,
too
,
"
replied
Mr.
Dove
.
<EOS>
"
Such
things
can
be
traced
,
and
can
be
held
as
heirlooms
without
imposing
too
great
difficulties
on
their
guardians
.
<EOS>
The
Law
is
generally
very
wise
and
prudent
,
Mr.
Camperdown
;
 
much
more
so
often
than
are
they
who
attempt
to
improve
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
quite
agree
with
you
there
,
Mr.
Dove
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Would
the
Law
do
a
service
,
do
you
think
,
if
it
lent
its
authority
to
the
special
preservation
in
special
hands
of
trinkets
only
to
be
used
for
vanity
and
ornament
?
<EOS>
Is
that
a
kind
of
property
over
which
an
owner
should
have
a
power
of
disposition
<EOS>
more
lasting
,
more
autocratic
,
than
is
given
him
even
in
regard
to
land
?
<EOS>
The
land
,
at
any
rate
,
can
be
traced
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
thing
fixed
and
known
.
<EOS>
A
string
of
pearls
is
not
only
alterable
,
but
constantly
altered
,
and
can
not
easily
be
traced
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Property
of
such
enormous
value
should
,
at
any
rate
,
be
protected
,
"
said
Mr.
Camperdown
indignantly
.
  
<EOS>
"
All
property
is
protected
,
Mr.
Camperdown
;
 
although
,
as
we
know
too
well
,
such
protection
can
never
be
perfect
.
<EOS>
But
the
system
of
heirlooms
,
if
there
can
be
said
to
be
such
a
system
,
was
not
devised
for
what
you
and
I
mean
when
we
talk
of
protection
of
property
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
have
said
that
that
was
just
what
it
was
devised
for
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
not
.
<EOS>
It
was
devised
with
the
more
picturesque
idea
of
maintaining
chivalric
associations
.
<EOS>
Heirlooms
have
become
so
,
not
that
the
future
owners
of
them
may
be
assured
of
so
much
wealth
,
whatever
the
value
of
the
thing
so
settled
may
be
,
 
but
that
the
son
or
grandson
or
descendant
may
enjoy
the
satisfaction
which
is
derived
from
saying
,
my
father
or
my
grandfather
or
my
ancestor
sat
in
that
chair
,
or
looked
as
he
now
looks
in
that
picture
,
or
was
graced
by
wearing
on
his
breast
that
very
ornament
which
you
now
see
lying
beneath
the
glass
.
<EOS>
Crown
jewels
are
heirlooms
in
the
same
way
,
as
representing
not
the
possession
of
the
sovereign
,
but
the
time
-
honoured
dignity
of
the
Crown
.
<EOS>
The
Law
,
which
,
in
general
,
concerns
itself
with
our
property
or
lives
and
our
liberties
,
has
in
this
matter
bowed
gracefully
to
the
spirit
of
chivalry
and
has
lent
its
aid
to
romance
;
 
but
it
certainly
did
not
do
so
to
enable
the
discordant
heirs
of
a
rich
man
to
settle
a
simple
dirty
question
of
money
,
which
,
with
ordinary
prudence
,
the
rich
man
should
himself
have
settled
before
he
died
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
Turtle
Dove
had
spoken
with
emphasis
and
had
spoken
well
,
and
Mr.
Camperdown
had
not
ventured
to
interrupt
him
while
he
was
speaking
.
<EOS>
He
was
sitting
far
back
on
his
chair
,
but
with
his
neck
bent
and
with
his
head
forward
,
rubbing
his
long
thin
hands
slowly
over
each
other
,
and
with
his
deep
bright
eyes
firmly
fixed
on
his
companion
's
face
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Camperdown
had
not
unfrequently
heard
him
speak
in
the
same
fashion
before
,
and
was
accustomed
to
his
manner
of
unravelling
the
mysteries
and
searching
into
the
causes
of
Law
with
a
spirit
which
almost
lent
poetry
to
the
subject
.
<EOS>
When
Mr.
Dove
would
do
so
,
Mr.
Camperdown
would
not
quite
understand
the
words
spoken
,
but
he
would
listen
to
them
with
an
undoubting
reverence
.
<EOS>
And
he
did
understand
them
in
part
,
and
was
conscious
of
an
infusion
of
a
certain
amount
of
poetic
spirit
into
his
own
bosom
.
<EOS>
He
would
think
of
these
speeches
afterwards
,
and
would
entertain
high
but
somewhat
cloudy
ideas
of
the
beauty
and
the
majesty
of
Law
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Dove
's
speeches
did
Mr.
Camperdown
good
,
and
helped
to
preserve
him
from
that
worst
of
all
diseases
,
 
a
low
idea
of
humanity
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
think
,
then
,
we
had
better
not
claim
them
as
heirlooms
?
<EOS>
"
he
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
had
better
not
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
think
that
she
could
claim
them
 
as
paraphernalia
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
That
question
has
hardly
been
put
to
me
,
 
though
I
allowed
myself
to
wander
into
it
.
<EOS>
But
for
my
intimacy
with
you
,
I
should
hardly
have
ventured
to
stray
so
far
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
need
hardly
say
how
much
obliged
we
are
.
<EOS>
But
we
will
submit
one
or
two
other
cases
to
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
inclined
to
think
the
court
would
not
allow
them
to
her
as
paraphernalia
,
seeing
that
their
value
is
excessive
as
compared
with
her
income
and
degree
;
but
if
it
did
,
it
would
do
so
in
a
fashion
that
would
guard
them
from
alienation
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
would
sell
them
 
under
the
rose
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
she
would
be
guilty
of
stealing
them
,
 
which
she
would
hardly
attempt
,
even
if
not
restrained
by
honesty
,
knowing
,
as
she
would
know
,
that
the
greatness
of
the
value
would
almost
assuredly
lead
to
detection
.
<EOS>
The
same
feeling
would
prevent
buyers
from
purchasing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
says
,
you
know
,
that
they
were
given
to
her
,
absolutely
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
to
know
the
circumstances
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Yes
;
 
of
course
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
should
be
disposed
to
think
that
in
equity
<EOS>
no
allegation
by
the
receiver
of
such
a
gift
,
unsubstantiated
either
by
evidence
or
by
deed
,
would
be
allowed
to
stand
.
<EOS>
The
gentleman
left
behind
him
a
will
,
and
regular
settlements
.
<EOS>
I
should
think
that
the
possession
of
these
diamonds
,
 
not
,
I
presume
,
touched
on
in
the
settlements
 
"
  
"
<EOS>
Oh
dear
<EOS>
no
;
 
not
a
word
about
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
think
,
then
,
that
,
subject
to
any
claim
for
paraphernalia
,
the
possession
of
the
diamonds
would
be
ruled
by
the
will
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Camperdown
was
rushing
into
the
further
difficulty
of
the
chattels
in
Scotland
and
those
in
England
,
when
the
Turtle
Dove
stopped
him
,
declaring
that
he
could
not
venture
to
discuss
matters
as
to
which
he
knew
none
of
the
facts
.
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
not
;
 
of
course
not
,
"
said
Mr.
Camperdown
.
<EOS>
"
We
'll
have
cases
prepared
.
<EOS>
I
'd
apologise
for
coming
at
all
,
only
that
I
get
so
much
from
a
few
words
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
always
delighted
to
see
you

Mr.
Camperdown

said
the
Turtle
Dove
,
bowing
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
Had
Better
Go
Away
"
 
When
Lord
Fawn
gave
a
sudden
jump
and
stalked
away
towards
the
house
on
that
Sunday
morning
before
breakfast
,
Lucy
Morris
was
a
very
unhappy
girl
.
<EOS>
She
had
a
second
time
accused
Lord
Fawn
of
speaking
an
untruth
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
quite
understand
the
usages
of
the
world
in
the
matter
;
but
she
did
know
that
the
one
offence
which
a
gentleman
is
supposed
never
to
commit
is
that
of
speaking
an
untruth
.
<EOS>
The
offence
may
be
one
committed
oftener
than
any
other
by
gentlemen
,
 
as
also
by
all
other
people
;
but
,
nevertheless
,
it
is
regarded
by
the
usages
of
society
as
being
the
one
thing
which
a
gentleman
never
does
.
<EOS>
Of
all
this
Lucy
understood
something
.
<EOS>
The
word
"
lie
"
<EOS>
she
knew
to
be
utterly
abominable
.
<EOS>
That
Lizzie
Eustace
was
a
little
liar
had
been
acknowledged
between
herself
and
the
Fawn
girls
very
often
,
 
but
to
have
told
Lady
Eustace
that
any
word
spoken
by
her
was
a
lie
,
would
have
been
a
worse
crime
than
the
lie
itself
.
<EOS>
To
have
brought
such
an
accusation
,
in
that
term
,
against
Lord
Fawn
,
would
have
been
to
degrade
herself
for
ever
.
<EOS>
Was
there
any
difference
between
a
lie
and
an
untruth
?
<EOS>
That
one
must
be
,
and
that
the
other
need
not
be
,
intentional
,
she
did
feel
;
but
she
felt
also
that
the
less
offensive
word
had
come
to
mean
a
lie
,
 
the
world
having
been
driven
so
to
use
it
because
the
world
did
not
dare
to
talk
about
lies
;
and
this
word
,
bearing
such
a
meaning
in
common
parlance
<EOS>
,
she
had
twice
applied
to
Lord
Fawn
.
<EOS>
And
yet
,
as
she
was
well
aware
,
Lord
Fawn
had
told
no
lie
.
<EOS>
He
had
himself
believed
every
word
that
he
had
spoken
against
Frank
Greystock
.
<EOS>
That
he
had
been
guilty
of
unmanly
cruelty
in
so
speaking
of
her
lover
in
her
presence
<EOS>
,
Lucy
still
thought
,
but
she
should
not
therefore
have
accused
him
of
falsehood
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
untrue
all
the
same
,
"
she
said
to
herself
,
as
she
stood
still
on
the
gravel
walk
,
watching
the
rapid
disappearance
of
Lord
Fawn
,
and
endeavouring
to
think
what
she
had
better
now
do
with
herself
.
<EOS>
Of
course
Lord
Fawn
,
like
a
great
child
,
would
at
once
go
and
tell
his
mother
what
that
wicked
governess
had
said
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
hall
she
met
her
friend
Lydia
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
Lucy
,
what
is
the
matter
with
Frederic
?
<EOS>
"
she
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
Lord
Fawn
is
very
angry
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
With
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
 
with
me
.
<EOS>
He
is
so
angry
that
I
am
sure
he
would
not
sit
down
to
breakfast
with
me
.
<EOS>
So
I
wo
n't
come
down
.
<EOS>
Will
you
tell
your
mamma
?
<EOS>
If
she
likes
to
send
to
me
,
of
course
I
'll
go
to
her
at
once
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
have
you
done
,
Lucy
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
've
told
him
again
that
what
he
said
was
n't
true
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
why
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Because
 
Oh
,
how
can
I
say
why
?
<EOS>
Why
does
any
person
do
everything
that
she
ought
not
to
do
?
<EOS>
It
's
the
fall
of
Adam
,
I
suppose
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
You
should
n't
make
a
joke
of
it
,
Lucy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
can
have
no
conception
how
unhappy
I
am
about
it
.
<EOS>
Of
course
Lady
Fawn
will
tell
me
to
go
away
.
<EOS>
I
went
out
on
purpose
to
beg
his
pardon
for
what
I
said
last
night
,
and
I
just
said
the
very
same
thing
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
why
did
you
say
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
should
say
it
again
and
again
and
again
,
if
he
were
to
go
on
telling
me
that
Mr.
Greystock
is
n't
a
gentleman
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
think
he
ought
to
have
done
it
.
<EOS>
Of
course
,
I
have
been
very
wrong
;
I
know
that
.
<EOS>
But
I
think
he
has
been
wrong
too
.
<EOS>
But
I
must
own
it
,
and
he
need
n't
.
<EOS>
I
'll
go
up
now
and
stay
in
my
own
room
till
your
mamma
sends
for
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
'll
get
Jane
to
bring
you
some
breakfast
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
care
a
bit
about
breakfast
,
"
said
Lucy
.
  
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
did
tell
his
mother
,
and
Lady
Fawn
was
perplexed
in
the
extreme
.
<EOS>
She
was
divided
in
her
judgment
and
feelings
between
the
privilege
due
to
Lucy
as
a
girl
possessed
of
an
authorised
lover
,
 
a
privilege
which
no
doubt
existed
,
but
which
was
not
extensive
,
 
and
the
very
much
greater
privilege
which
attached
to
Lord
Fawn
as
a
man
,
as
a
peer
,
as
an
Under
-
Secretary
of
State
,
 
but
which
attached
to
him
especially
as
the
head
and
only
man
belonging
to
the
Fawn
family
.
<EOS>
Such
a
one
,
when
,
moved
by
filial
duty
<EOS>
,
he
condescends
to
come
once
a
week
to
his
mother
's
house
,
is
entitled
to
say
whatever
he
pleases
,
and
should
on
no
account
be
contradicted
by
any
one
.
<EOS>
Lucy
no
doubt
had
a
lover
,
 
an
authorised
lover
;
but
perhaps
that
fact
could
not
be
taken
as
more
than
a
balancing
weight
against
the
inferiority
of
her
position
as
a
governess
.
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
was
of
course
obliged
to
take
her
son
's
part
,
and
would
scold
Lucy
.
<EOS>
Lucy
must
be
scolded
very
seriously
.
<EOS>
But
it
would
be
a
thing
so
desirable
if
Lucy
could
be
induced
to
accept
her
scolding
and
have
done
with
it
,
and
not
to
make
matters
worse
by
talking
of
going
away
!
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
mean
that
she
came
out
into
the
shrubbery
,
having
made
up
her
mind
to
be
rude
to
you
?
"
said
Lady
Fawn
to
her
son
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
 
I
do
not
think
that
.
<EOS>
But
her
temper
is
so
ungovernable
,
and
she
has
,
if
I
may
say
so
,
been
so
spoilt
among
you
here
,
 
<EOS>
I
mean
by
the
girls
,
of
course
,
 
that
she
does
not
know
how
to
restrain
herself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
is
as
good
as
gold
,
you
know
,
Frederic
.
"
<EOS>
He
shrugged
his
shoulders
,
and
declared
that
he
had
not
a
word
more
to
say
about
it
.
<EOS>
He
could
,
of
course
,
remain
in
London
till
it
should
suit
Mr.
Greystock
to
take
his
bride
.
<EOS>
"
You
'll
break
my
heart
if
you
say
that
!
"
exclaimed
the
unhappy
mother
.
<EOS>
"
Of
course
,
she
shall
leave
the
house
if
you
wish
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
nothing
,
"
said
Lord
Fawn
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
peculiarly
object
to
be
told
that
I
am
a
 
liar
.
<EOS>
"
Then
he
stalked
away
along
the
corridor
and
went
down
to
breakfast
,
as
black
as
a
thunder
-
cloud
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
and
Lucy
sat
opposite
to
each
other
in
church
,
but
they
did
not
speak
till
the
afternoon
.
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
went
to
church
in
the
carriage
and
Lucy
walked
,
and
as
Lucy
retired
to
her
room
immediately
on
her
return
to
the
house
,
there
had
not
been
an
opportunity
even
for
a
word
.
<EOS>
After
lunch
Amelia
came
up
to
her
,
and
sat
down
for
a
long
discussion
.
"
<EOS>
Now
,
Lucy
,
something
must
be
done
,
you
know
,
"
said
Amelia
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
,
mamma
must
see
you
.
<EOS>
She
ca
n't
allow
things
to
go
on
in
this
way
.
<EOS>
Mamma
is
very
unhappy
,
and
did
n't
eat
a
morsel
of
breakfast
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
By
this
latter
assertion
Amelia
simply
intended
to
imply
that
her
mother
had
refused
to
be
helped
a
second
time
to
fried
bacon
,
as
was
customary
.
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
,
I
shall
go
to
her
the
moment
she
sends
for
me
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
 
I
am
so
unhappy
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
wonder
at
that
,
Lucy
.
<EOS>
So
is
my
brother
unhappy
.
<EOS>
These
things
make
people
unhappy
.
<EOS>
It
is
what
the
world
calls
 
temper
,
you
know
,
Lucy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
did
he
tell
me
that
Mr.
Greystock
is
n't
a
gentleman
?
<EOS>
Mr.
Greystock
is
a
gentleman
.
<EOS>
I
meant
to
say
nothing
more
than
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
did
say
more
,
Lucy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
When
he
said
that
Mr.
Greystock
was
n't
a
gentleman
,
I
told
him
it
was
n't
true
.
<EOS>
Why
did
he
say
it
?
<EOS>
He
knows
all
about
it
.
<EOS>
Everybody
knows
.
<EOS>
Would
you
think
it
wise
to
come
and
abuse
him
to
me
,
when
you
know
what
he
is
to
me
?
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
bear
it
,
and
I
wo
n't
.
<EOS>
I
'll
go
away
to
-
morrow
,
if
your
mamma
wishes
it
.
"
<EOS>
But
that
going
away
was
just
what
Lady
Fawn
did
not
wish
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
know
,
Lucy
,
you
should
express
your
deep
sorrow
at
what
has
passed
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
To
your
brother
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
he
would
abuse
Mr.
Greystock
again
,
and
it
would
all
be
as
bad
as
ever
.
<EOS>
I
'll
beg
Lord
Fawn
's
pardon
if
he
'll
promise
beforehand
not
to
say
a
word
about
Mr.
Greystock
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
ca
n't
expect
him
to
make
a
bargain
like
that
,
Lucy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
not
.
<EOS>
I
daresay
I
'm
very
wicked
,
and
I
must
be
left
wicked
.
<EOS>
I
'm
too
wicked
to
stay
here
.
<EOS>
That
's
the
long
and
the
short
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
afraid
you
're
proud
,
Lucy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
I
am
.
<EOS>
If
it
was
n't
for
all
that
I
owe
to
everybody
here
,
and
that
I
love
you
all
so
much
,
I
should
be
proud
of
being
proud
;
 
because
of
Mr.
Greystock
.
<EOS>
Only
it
kills
me
to
make
Lady
Fawn
unhappy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Amelia
left
the
culprit
,
feeling
that
no
good
had
been
done
,
and
Lady
Fawn
did
not
see
the
delinquent
till
late
in
the
afternoon
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
had
,
in
the
meantime
,
wandered
out
along
the
river
all
alone
to
brood
over
the
condition
of
his
affairs
.
<EOS>
It
had
been
an
evil
day
for
him
in
which
he
had
first
seen
Lady
Eustace
.
<EOS>
From
the
first
moment
of
his
engagement
to
her
<EOS>
he
had
been
an
unhappy
man
.
<EOS>
Her
treatment
of
him
,
the
stories
which
reached
his
ears
from
Mrs.
Hittaway
and
others
,
Mr.
Camperdown
's
threats
of
law
in
regard
to
the
diamonds
,
and
Frank
Greystock
's
insults
,
altogether
made
him
aware
that
he
could
not
possibly
marry
Lady
Eustace
.
<EOS>
But
yet
he
had
no
proper
and
becoming
way
of
escaping
from
the
bonds
of
his
engagement
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
man
with
a
conscience
,
and
was
made
miserable
by
the
idea
of
behaving
badly
to
a
woman
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
it
might
have
been
difficult
to
analyse
his
misery
,
and
to
decide
how
much
arose
from
the
feeling
that
he
was
behaving
badly
,
and
how
much
from
the
conviction
that
the
world
would
accuse
him
of
doing
so
;
but
,
between
the
two
,
he
was
wretched
enough
.
<EOS>
The
punishment
of
the
offence
had
been
commenced
by
Greystock
's
unavenged
insults
;
 
and
it
now
seemed
to
him
that
this
girl
's
conduct
was
a
continuation
of
it
.
<EOS>
The
world
was
already
beginning
to
treat
him
with
that
want
of
respect
which
he
so
greatly
dreaded
.
<EOS>
He
knew
that
he
was
too
weak
to
stand
up
against
a
widely
-
spread
expression
of
opinion
that
he
had
behaved
badly
.
<EOS>
There
are
men
who
can
walk
about
the
streets
with
composed
countenances
,
take
their
seats
in
Parliament
if
they
happen
to
have
seats
,
work
in
their
offices
,
or
their
chambers
,
or
their
counting
-
houses
with
diligence
,
and
go
about
the
world
serenely
,
even
though
everybody
be
saying
evil
of
them
behind
their
backs
.
<EOS>
Such
men
can
live
down
temporary
calumny
,
and
almost
take
a
delight
in
the
isolation
which
it
will
produce
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
knew
well
that
he
was
not
such
a
man
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
described
his
own
weakness
as
caused
,
perhaps
,
by
a
too
thin
-
skinned
sensitiveness
.
<EOS>
Those
who
knew
him
were
inclined
to
say
that
he
lacked
strength
of
character
,
and
,
perhaps
,
courage
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
certainly
engaged
himself
to
marry
this
widow
,
and
he
was
most
desirous
to
do
what
was
right
.
<EOS>
He
had
said
that
he
would
not
marry
her
unless
she
would
give
up
the
necklace
,
and
he
was
most
desirous
to
be
true
to
his
word
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
twice
insulted
,
and
he
was
anxious
to
support
these
injuries
with
dignity
.
<EOS>
Poor
Lucy
's
little
offence
against
him
rankled
in
his
mind
with
the
other
great
offences
.
<EOS>
That
this
humble
friend
of
his
mother
's
should
have
been
so
insolent
was
a
terrible
thing
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
sure
even
whether
his
own
sisters
did
not
treat
him
with
scantier
reverence
than
of
yore
.
<EOS>
And
yet
he
was
so
anxious
to
do
right
,
and
do
his
duty
in
that
state
of
life
to
which
it
had
pleased
God
to
call
him
!
<EOS>
As
to
much
he
was
in
doubt
;
but
of
two
things
he
was
quite
sure
,
 
that
Frank
Greystock
was
a
scoundrel
,
and
that
Lucy
Morris
was
the
most
impertinent
young
woman
in
England
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
would
you
wish
to
have
done
,
Frederic
?
"
<EOS>
his
mother
said
to
him
on
his
return
.
  
<EOS>
"
In
what
respect
,
mother
?
"
  
"
About
Lucy
Morris
?
<EOS>
I
have
not
seen
her
yet
.
<EOS>
I
have
thought
it
better
that
she
should
be
left
to
herself
for
a
while
before
I
did
so
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
she
must
come
down
to
dinner
.
<EOS>
She
always
does
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
wish
to
interfere
with
the
young
lady
's
meals
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
 
but
about
meeting
her
?
<EOS>
If
there
is
to
be
no
talking
it
will
be
so
very
unpleasant
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
unpleasant
to
us
all
,
but
I
am
thinking
chiefly
of
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
wish
anybody
to
be
disturbed
for
my
comfort
.
"
<EOS>
A
young
woman
coming
down
to
dinner
as
though
in
disgrace
,
and
not
being
spoken
to
by
any
one
,
would
,
in
truth
,
have
had
rather
a
soothing
effect
upon
Lord
Fawn
,
who
would
have
felt
that
the
general
silence
and
dulness
had
been
produced
as
a
sacrifice
in
his
honour
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
,
of
course
,
insist
that
she
should
apologise
;
but
if
she
refuses
,
what
shall
I
do
then
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Let
there
be
no
more
apologies
,
if
you
please
,
mother
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
shall
I
do
then
,
Frederic
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Miss
Morris
's
idea
of
an
apology
is
a
repetition
of
her
offence
with
increased
rudeness
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
for
me
to
say
what
you
should
do
.
<EOS>
If
it
be
true
that
she
is
engaged
to
that
man
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
It
is
true
,
certainly
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
No
doubt
that
will
make
her
quite
independent
of
you
,
and
I
can
understand
that
her
presence
here
in
such
circumstances
must
be
very
uncomfortable
to
you
all
.
<EOS>
No
doubt
she
feels
her
power
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
,
Frederic
,
you
do
not
know
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
hardly
say
that
I
desire
to
know
her
better
.
<EOS>
You
can
not
suppose
that
I
can
be
anxious
for
further
intimacy
with
a
young
lady
who
has
twice
given
me
the
lie
in
your
house
.
<EOS>
Such
conduct
is
,
at
least
,
very
unusual
;
and
as
no
absolute
punishment
can
be
inflicted
,
the
offender
can
only
be
avoided
.
<EOS>
It
is
thus
,
and
thus
only
,
that
such
offences
can
be
punished
.
<EOS>
I
shall
be
satisfied
if
you
will
give
her
to
understand
that
I
should
prefer
that
she
should
not
address
me
again

"
  
<EOS>
Poor
Lady
Fawn
was
beginning
to
think
that
Lucy
was
right
in
saying
that
there
was
no
remedy
for
all
these
evils
but
that
she
should
go
away
.
<EOS>
But
whither
was
she
to
go
?
<EOS>
She
had
no
home
but
such
home
as
she
could
earn
for
herself
by
her
services
as
a
governess
,
and
in
her
present
position
it
was
almost
out
of
the
question
that
she
should
seek
another
place
.
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
,
too
,
felt
that
she
had
pledged
herself
to
Mr.
Greystock
that
till
next
year
Lucy
should
have
a
home
at
Fawn
Court
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Greystock
,
indeed
,
was
now
an
enemy
to
the
family
;
but
Lucy
was
not
an
enemy
,
and
it
was
out
of
the
question
that
she
should
be
treated
with
real
enmity
.
<EOS>
She
might
be
scolded
,
and
scowled
at
,
and
put
into
a
kind
of
drawing
-
room
Coventry
for
a
time
,
 
so
that
all
kindly
intercourse
with
her
should
be
confined
to
school
-
room
work
and
bed
-
room
conferences
.
<EOS>
She
could
be
generally
"
sat
upon
,
"
as
Nina
would
call
it
.
<EOS>
But
as
for
quarrelling
with
her
,
 
making
a
real
enemy
of
one
whom
they
all
loved
,
one
whom
Lady
Fawn
knew
to
be
"
as
good
as
gold
,
"
one
who
had
become
so
dear
to
the
old
lady
that
actual
extrusion
from
their
family
affections
would
be
like
the
cutting
off
of
a
limb
,
 
that
was
simply
impossible
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I
suppose
I
had
better
go
and
see
her
,
"
said
Lady
Fawn
,
 
"
<EOS>
and
I
have
got
such
a
headache
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
not
see
her
on
my
account
,
"
said
Lord
Fawn
.
<EOS>
The
duty
,
however
,
was
obligatory
,
and
Lady
Fawn
with
slow
steps
sought
Lucy
in
the
school
-
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
Lucy
,
"
she
said
,
seating
herself
,
"
what
is
to
be
the
end
of
all
this
?
"
  
<EOS>
Lucy
came
up
to
her
and
knelt
at
her
feet
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
knew
how
unhappy
I
am
because
I
have
vexed
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
unhappy
,
my
dear

warm

misbehaviour

why

you
not

horrible

Augusta

would
not
you
be
angry

<EOS>
Would
you
be
able
to
stand
it

<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
was
not
clear
-
headed
;
she
was
not
clever
;
nor
was
she
even
always
rational
.
<EOS>
But
she
was
essentially
honest

<EOS>
She
knew
that
she
would
fly
at
anybody
who
should
in
her
presence
say
such
bitter
things
of
any
of
her
children
as
Lord
Fawn
had
said
of
Mr.
Greystock
in
Lucy
's
hearing
;
 
and
she
knew
also
that
Lucy
was
entitled
to
hold
Mr.
Greystock
as
dearly
as
she
held
her
own
sons
and
daughters
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
,
at
Fawn
Court
,
could
not
do
wrong
.
<EOS>
That
was
a
tenet
by
which
she
was
obliged
to
hold
fast
.
<EOS>
And
yet
Lucy
had
been
subjected
to
great
cruelty
.
<EOS>
She
thought
awhile
for
a
valid
argument
.
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
"
she
said
,
"
your
youth
should
make
a
difference
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
it
should
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
though
to
me
and
to
the
girls
you
are
as
dear
as
any
friend
can
be
,
and
may
say
just
what
you
please
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
we
all
live
here
in
such
a
way
that
we
all
do
say
just
what
we
please
,
 
young
and
old
together
.
<EOS>
But
you
ought
to
know
that
Lord
Fawn
is
different
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ought
he
to
say
that
Mr.
Greystock
is
not
a
gentleman
to
me
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
are
,
of
course
,
very
sorry
that
there
should
be
any
quarrel
.
<EOS>
It
is
all
the
fault
of
that
 
nasty
,
false
young
woman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
So
it
is
,
Lady
Fawn
.
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
,
I
have
been
thinking
about
it
all
the
day
,
and
I
am
quite
sure
that
I
had
better
not
stay
here
while
you
and
the
girls
think
badly
of
Mr.
Greystock
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
only
about
Lord
Fawn
,
but
because
of
the
whole
thing
.
<EOS>
I
am
always
wanting
to
say
something
good
about
Mr.
Greystock
,
and
you
are
always
thinking
something
bad
about
him
.
<EOS>
You
have
been
to
me
,
 
oh
,
the
very
best
friend
that
a
girl
ever
had
.
<EOS>
Why
you
should
have
treated
me
so
generously
I
never
could
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Because
we
have
loved
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
when
a
girl
has
got
a
man
whom
she
loves
,
and
has
promised
to
marry
,
he
must
be
her
best
friend
of
all
.
<EOS>
Is
it
not
so
,
Lady
Fawn
?
"
<EOS>
The
old
woman
stooped
down
and
kissed
the
girl
who
had
got
the
man
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
ingratitude
to
you
that
makes
me
think
most
of
him
;
is
it
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Certainly
not
,
dear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
I
had
better
go
away
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
where
will
you
go
,
Lucy
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
consult
Mr.
Greystock
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
what
can
he
do
,
Lucy
?
<EOS>
It
will
only
be
a
trouble
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
ca
n't
find
a
home
for
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
they
would
have
me
at
the
deanery
,
"
said
Lucy
slowly
.
<EOS>
She
had
evidently
been
thinking
much
of
it
all
.
"
<EOS>
And
,
Lady
Fawn
,
I
will
not
go
down
-
stairs
while
Lord
Fawn
is
here
;
and
when
he
comes
,
 
if
he
does
come
again
while
I
am
here
,
 
he
shall
not
be
troubled
by
seeing
me
.
<EOS>
He
may
be
sure
of
that
.
<EOS>
And
you
may
tell
him
that
I
do
n't
defend
myself
,
only
I
shall
always
think
that
he
ought
not
to
have
said
that
Mr.
Greystock
was
n't
a
gentleman
before
me
.
"
<EOS>
When
Lady
Fawn
left
Lucy
the
matter
was
so
far
settled
that
Lucy
had
neither
been
asked
to
come
down
to
dinner
,
nor
had
she
been
forbidden
to
seek
another
home
.
   
<EOS>
Mr.
Greystock
's
Troubles
 
Frank
Greystock
stayed
the
Sunday
in
London
and
went
down
to
Bobsborough
on
the
Monday
.
<EOS>
His
father
and
mother
and
sister
all
knew
of
his
engagement
to
Lucy
,
and
they
had
heard
also
that
Lady
Eustace
was
to
become
Lady
Fawn
.
<EOS>
Of
the
necklace
they
had
hitherto
heard
very
little
,
and
of
the
quarrel
between
the
two
lovers
they
had
heard
nothing
.
<EOS>
There
had
been
many
misgivings
at
the
deanery
,
and
some
regrets
,
about
these
marriages
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Greystock
,
Frank
's
mother
,
was
,
as
we
are
so
wo
nt
to
say
of
many
women
,
the
best
woman
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
She
was
unselfish
,
affectionate
,
charitable
,
and
thoroughly
feminine
.
<EOS>
But
she
did
think
that
her
son
Frank
,
with
all
his
advantages
,
 
good
looks
,
cleverness
,
general
popularity
,
and
seat
in
Parliament
,
 
might
just
as
well
marry
an
heiress
as
a
little
girl
without
twopence
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
As
for
herself
,
who
had
been
born
a
Jackson
,
she
could
do
with
very
little
;
but
the
Greystocks
were
all
people
who
wanted
money
.
<EOS>
For
them
there
was
never
more
than
ninepence
in
a
shilling
,
if
so
much
.
<EOS>
They
were
a
race
who
could
not
pay
their
way
with
moderate
incomes
.
<EOS>
Even
the
dear
dean
,
who
really
had
a
conscience
about
money
,
and
who
hardly
ever
left
Bobsborough
,
could
not
be
kept
quite
clear
of
debt
,
let
her
do
what
she
would
.
<EOS>
As
for
the
admiral
,
the
dean
's
elder
brother
,
he
had
been
notorious
for
insolvency
;
and
Frank
was
a
Greystock
all
over
.
<EOS>
He
was
the
very
man
to
whom
money
with
a
wife
was
almost
a
necessity
of
existence
.
  
<EOS>
And
his
pretty
cousin
,
the
widow
,
who
was
devoted
to
him
,
and
would
have
married
him
at
a
word
,
had
ever
so
many
thousands
a
year
!
<EOS>
Of
course
,
Lizzie
Eustace
was
not
just
all
that
she
should
be
;
 
but
then
who
is
?
<EOS>
In
one
respect
,
at
any
rate
,
her
conduct
had
always
been
proper
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
rumour
against
her
as
to
lovers
or
flirtations
.
<EOS>
She
was
very
young
,
and
Frank
might
have
moulded
her
as
he
pleased
.
<EOS>
Of
course
there
were
regrets
.
<EOS>
Poor
dear
little
Lucy
Morris
was
as
good
as
gold
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Greystock
was
quite
willing
to
admit
that
.
<EOS>
She
was
not
good
-
looking
;
 
so
at
least
Mrs.
Greystock
said
.
<EOS>
She
never
would
allow
that
Lucy
was
good
-
looking
.
<EOS>
And
she
did
n't
see
much
in
Lucy
,
who
,
according
to
her
idea
,
was
a
little
chit
of
a
thing
.
<EOS>
Her
position
was
simply
that
of
a
governess
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Greystock
declared
to
her
daughter
that
no
one
in
the
whole
world
had
a
higher
respect
for
governesses
than
had
she
.
<EOS>
But
a
governess
is
a
governess
;
 
and
for
a
man
in
Frank
's
position
such
a
marriage
would
be
simply
suicide
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
should
n't
say
that
,
mamma
,
now
;
for
it
's
fixed
,
"
said
Ellinor
Greystock
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
do
say
it
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
Things
sometimes
are
fixed
which
must
be
unfixed
.
<EOS>
You
know
your
brother
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Frank
is
earning
a
large
income
,
mamma
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
you
ever
know
a
Greystock
who
did
n't
want
more
than
his
income
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
I
do
n't
,
mamma
,
and
mine
is
very
small
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
're
a
Jackson
.
<EOS>
Frank
is
Greystock
to
the
very
backbone
.
<EOS>
If
he
marries
Lucy
Morris
he
must
give
up
Parliament
.
<EOS>
That
's
all
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
dean
himself
was
more
reticent
and
less
given
to
interference
than
his
wife
;
but
he
felt
it
also
.
<EOS>
He
would
not
for
the
world
have
hinted
to
his
son
that
it
might
be
well
to
marry
money
;
but
he
thought
that
it
was
a
good
thing
that
his
son
should
go
where
money
was
.
<EOS>
He
knew
that
Frank
was
apt
to
spend
his
guineas
faster
than
he
got
them
.
<EOS>
All
his
life
long
the
dean
had
seen
what
came
of
such
spending
.
<EOS>
Frank
had
gone
out
into
the
world
and
had
prospered
,
 
but
he
could
hardly
continue
to
prosper
unless
he
married
money
.
<EOS>
Of
course
,
there
had
been
regrets
when
the
news
came
of
that
fatal
engagement
with
Lucy
Morris
.
<EOS>
"
It
ca
n't
be
for
the
next
ten
years
,
at
any
rate
,
"
said
Mrs.
Greystock
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
thought
at
one
time
that
he
would
have
made
a
match
with
his
cousin
,
"
said
the
dean
.
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
;
 
so
did
everybody
,
"
replied
Mrs.
Dean
.
  
<EOS>
Then
Frank
came
among
them
.
<EOS>
He
had
intended
staying
some
weeks
,
 
perhaps
for
a
month
,
and
great
preparations
were
made
for
him
;
but
immediately
on
his
arrival
he
announced
the
necessity
that
was
incumbent
on
him
of
going
down
again
to
Scotland
in
ten
days
.
<EOS>
"
You
've
heard
about
Lizzie
,
of
course
?
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
They
had
heard
that
Lizzie
was
to
become
Lady
Fawn
,
but
beyond
that
they
had
heard
nothing
.
<EOS>
"
You
know
about
the
necklace
?
"
asked
Frank
.
<EOS>
Something
of
a
tale
of
a
necklace
had
made
its
way
even
down
to
quiet
Bobsborough
.
<EOS>
They
had
been
informed
that
there
was
a
dispute
between
the
widow
and
the
executors
of
the
late
Sir
Florian
about
some
diamonds
.
"
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
is
behaving
about
it
in
the
most
atrocious
manner
,
"
continued
Frank
,
"
and
the
long
and
the
short
of
it
is
that
there
will
be
no
marriage
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
marriage
!
"
exclaimed
Mrs.
Greystock
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
is
the
truth
about
the
diamonds
?
"
asked
the
dean
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
;
 
it
will
give
the
lawyers
a
job
before
they
decide
that
.
<EOS>
They
're
very
valuable
;
 
worth
about
ten
thousand
pounds
,
I
'm
told
;
but
the
most
of
it
will
go
among
some
of
my
friends
at
the
Chancery
bar
.
<EOS>
It
's
a
pity
that
I
should
be
out
of
the
scramble
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
why
should
you
be
out
?
"
asked
his
mother
with
tender
regrets
,
 
not
thinking
of
the
matter
as
her
son
was
thinking
of
it
,
but
feeling
that
when
there
was
so
much
wealth
so
very
near
him
,
he
ought
not
to
let
it
all
go
past
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
As
far
as
I
can
see
,
"
continued
Frank
,
"
she
has
a
fair
claim
to
them
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
they
'll
file
a
bill
in
Chancery
,
and
then
it
will
be
out
of
my
line
altogether
.
<EOS>
She
says
her
husband
gave
them
to
her
,
 
absolutely
put
them
on
her
neck
himself
,
and
told
her
that
they
were
hers
.
<EOS>
As
to
their
being
an
heirloom
,
that
turns
out
to
be
impossible
.
<EOS>
I
did
n't
know
it
,
but
it
seems
you
ca
n't
make
diamonds
an
heirloom
.
<EOS>
What
astonishes
me
is
,
that
Fawn
should
object
to
the
necklace
.
<EOS>
However
,
he
has
objected
,
and
has
simply
told
her
that
he
wo
n't
marry
her
unless
she
gives
them
up
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
does
she
say
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Storms
and
raves
,
 
as
of
course
any
woman
would
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
think
she
is
behaving
badly
.
<EOS>
What
she
wants
is
,
to
reduce
him
to
obedience
,
and
then
to
dismiss
him
.
<EOS>
I
think
that
is
no
more
than
fair
.
<EOS>
Nothing
on
earth
would
make
her
marry
him
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
she
ever
care
for
him
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
she
ever
did
.
<EOS>
She
found
her
position
to
be
troublesome
,
and
she
thought
she
had
better
marry
.
<EOS>
And
then
he
's
a
lord
,
 
which
always
goes
for
something
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
you
should
have
so
much
trouble
,
"
said
Mrs.
Greystock
.
<EOS>
But
in
truth
the
mother
was
not
sorry
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
declare
to
herself
that
it
would
be
a
good
thing
that
her
son
should
be
false
to
Lucy
Morris
in
order
that
he
might
marry
his
rich
cousin
;
but
she
did
feel
it
to
be
an
advantage
that
he
should
be
on
terms
of
intimacy
with
so
large
an
income
as
that
belonging
to
Lady
Eustace
.
"
<EOS>
Doan't
thou
marry
for
munny
,
but
goa
where
munny
is
.
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Greystock
would
have
repudiated
the
idea
of
mercenary
marriages
in
any
ordinary
conversation
,
and
would
have
been
severe
on
any
gentleman
who
was
false
to
a
young
lady
.
<EOS>
But
it
is
so
hard
to
bring
one
's
general
principles
to
bear
on
one
's
own
conduct
or
in
one
's
own
family
;
 
and
then
the
Greystocks
were
so
peculiar
a
people
!
<EOS>
When
her
son
told
her
that
he
must
go
down
to
Scotland
again
very
shortly
,
she
reconciled
herself
to
his
loss
.
<EOS>
Had
he
left
Bobsborough
for
the
sake
of
being
near
Lucy
at
Richmond
,
she
would
have
felt
it
very
keenly
.
  
<EOS>
Days
passed
by
,
and
nothing
was
said
about
poor
Lucy
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Greystock
had
made
up
her
mind
that
she
would
say
nothing
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
Lucy
had
behaved
badly
in
allowing
herself
to
be
loved
by
a
man
who
ought
to
have
loved
money
,
and
Mrs.
Greystock
had
resolved
that
she
would
show
her
feelings
by
silence
.
<EOS>
The
dean
had
formed
no
fixed
determination
,
but
he
had
thought
that
it
might
be
,
perhaps
,
as
well
to
drop
the
subject
.
<EOS>
Frank
himself
was
unhappy
about
it
;
but
from
morning
to
evening
,
and
from
day
to
day
,
he
allowed
it
to
pass
by
without
a
word
.
<EOS>
He
knew
that
it
should
not
be
so
,
that
such
silence
was
in
truth
treachery
to
Lucy
;
 
but
he
was
silent
.
<EOS>
What
had
he
meant
when
,
as
he
left
Lizzie
Eustace
among
the
rocks
at
Portray
,
 
in
that
last
moment
,
 
he
had
assured
her
that
he
would
be
true
to
her
?
<EOS>
And
what
had
been
Lizzie
's
meaning
?
<EOS>
He
was
more
sure
of
Lizzie
's
meaning
than
he
was
of
his
own
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
very
rough
world
to
live
in
,
"
he
said
to
himself
in
these
days
as
he
thought
of
his
difficulties
.
  
<EOS>
But
when
he
had
been
nearly
a
week
at
the
deanery
,
and
when
the
day
of
his
going
was
so
near
as
to
be
a
matter
of
concern
,
his
sister
did
at
last
venture
to
say
a
word
about
Lucy
.
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
there
is
nothing
settled
about
your
own
marriage
,
Frank
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nothing
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nor
will
be
for
some
while
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nor
will
be
,
 
for
some
while
.
<EOS>
"
This
he
said
in
a
tone
which
he
himself
felt
to
be
ill
-
humoured
and
almost
petulant
.
<EOS>
And
he
felt
also
that
such
ill
-
humour
on
such
a
subject
was
unkind
,
not
to
his
sister
,
but
to
Lucy
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
to
imply
that
the
matter
of
his
marriage
was
distasteful
to
him
.
"
<EOS>
The
truth
is
,
"
he
said
,
"
that
nothing
can
be
fixed
.
<EOS>
Lucy
understands
that
as
well
as
I
do
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
in
a
position
at
once
to
marry
a
girl
who
has
nothing
.
<EOS>
It
's
a
pity
,
perhaps
,
that
one
ca
n't
train
one
's
self
to
like
some
girl
best
that
has
got
money
;
but
as
I
have
n't
,
there
must
be
some
delay
.
<EOS>
She
is
to
stay
where
she
is
,
 
at
any
rate
,
for
a
twelvemonth
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
mean
to
see
her
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
yes
;
I
hardly
know
how
I
can
see
her
,
as
I
have
quarrelled
to
the
knife
with
Lord
Fawn
;
and
Lord
Fawn
is
recognised
by
his
mother
and
sisters
as
the
one
living
Jupiter
upon
earth
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
like
them
for
that
,
"
said
Ellinor
.
  
<EOS>
"
Only
it
prevents
my
going
to
Richmond
;
 
and
poor
Fawn
himself
is
such
an
indifferent
Jupiter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
That
was
all
that
was
said
about
Lucy
at
Bobsborough
,
till
there
came
a
letter
from
Lucy
to
her
lover
acquainting
him
with
the
circumstances
of
her
unfortunate
position
at
Richmond
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
tell
him
quite
all
the
circumstances
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
repeat
the
strong
expressions
which
Lord
Fawn
had
used
,
nor
did
she
clearly
explain
how
wrathful
she
had
been
herself
.
"
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
has
been
here
,
"
she
said
,
"
and
there
has
been
ever
so
much
unpleasantness
.
<EOS>
He
is
very
angry
with
you
about
Lady
Eustace
,
and
of
course
Lady
Fawn
takes
his
part
.
<EOS>
I
need
not
tell
you
whose
part
I
take
.
<EOS>
And
so
there
have
been
what
the
servants
call
 
"
just
a
few
words
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
very
dreadful
,
is
n't
it
?
<EOS>
And
,
after
all
,
Lady
Fawn
has
been
as
kind
as
possible
.
<EOS>
But
the
upshot
of
it
is
,
that
I
am
not
to
stay
here
.
<EOS>
You
must
n't
suppose
that
I
'm
to
be
turned
out
at
twelve
hours
"
notice
.
<EOS>
I
am
to
stay
till
arrangements
have
been
made
,
and
everybody
will
be
kind
to
me
.
<EOS>
But
what
had
I
better
do
?
<EOS>
I
'll
try
and
get
another
situation
at
once
if
you
think
it
best
,
only
I
suppose
I
should
have
to
explain
how
long
I
could
stay
.
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
knows
that
I
am
writing
to
you
to
ask
you
what
you
think
best
.
"
  
<EOS>
On
receipt
of
this
,
Greystock
was
very
much
puzzled
.
<EOS>
What
a
little
fool
Lucy
had
been
,
and
yet
what
a
dear
little
fool
!
<EOS>
Who
cared
for
Lord
Fawn
and
his
hard
words
?
<EOS>
Of
course
,
Lord
Fawn
would
say
all
manner
of
evil
things
of
him
,
and
would
crow
valiantly
in
his
own
farm
-
yard
;
but
it
would
have
been
so
much
wiser
on
Lucy
's
part
to
have
put
up
with
the
crowing
,
and
to
have
disregarded
altogether
the
words
of
a
man
so
weak
and
insignificant
!
<EOS>
But
the
evil
was
done
,
and
he
must
make
some
arrangement
for
poor
Lucy
's
comfort
.
<EOS>
Had
he
known
exactly
how
matters
stood
,
that
the
proposition
as
to
Lucy
's
departure
had
come
wholly
from
herself
,
and
that
at
the
present
time
all
the
ladies
at
Fawn
Court
,
 
of
course
,
in
the
absence
of
Lord
Fawn
,
 
were
quite
disposed
to
forgive
Lucy
if
Lucy
would
only
be
forgiven
,
and
hide
herself
when
Lord
Fawn
should
come
;
 
had
Frank
known
all
this
,
he
might
,
perhaps
,
have
counselled
her
to
remain
at
Richmond
.
<EOS>
But
he
believed
that
Lady
Fawn
had
insisted
on
Lucy
's
departure
;
and
of
course
,
in
such
a
case
,
Lucy
must
depart
.
<EOS>
He
showed
the
letter
to
his
sister
,
and
asked
for
advice
.
<EOS>
"
How
very
unfortunate
!
"
said
Ellinor
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
is
it
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
what
she
said
to
Lord
Fawn
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
would
speak
out
very
plainly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
she
has
spoken
out
plainly
,
or
otherwise
they
would
never
have
told
her
to
go
away
.
<EOS>
It
seems
so
unlike
what
I
have
always
heard
of
Lady
Fawn
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Lucy
can
be
very
headstrong
if
she
pleases
,
"
said
Lucy
's
lover
.
<EOS>
"
What
on
earth
had
I
better
do
for
her
?
<EOS>
I
do
n't
suppose
she
can
get
another
place
that
would
suit
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
she
is
to
be
your
wife
,
I
do
n't
think
she
should
go
into
another
place
.
<EOS>
If
it
is
quite
fixed
,
 
"
she
said
,
and
then
she
looked
into
her
brother
's
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
;
what
then
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
are
sure
you
mean
it
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
Of
course
I
mean
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
she
had
better
come
here
.
<EOS>
As
for
her
going
out
as
a
governess
,
and
telling
the
people
that
she
is
to
be
your
wife
in
a
few
months
,
that
is
out
of
the
question
.
<EOS>
And
it
would
,
I
think
,
be
equally
so
that
she
should
go
into
any
house
and
not
tell
the
truth
.
<EOS>
Of
course
,
this
would
be
the
place
for
her
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
at
last
decided
that
Ellinor
should
discuss
the
matter
with
her
mother
.
  
<EOS>
When
the
whole
matter
was
unfolded
to
Mrs.
Greystock
,
that
lady
was
more
troubled
than
ever
.
<EOS>
If
Lucy
were
to
come
to
the
deanery
,
she
must
come
as
Frank
's
affianced
bride
,
and
must
be
treated
as
such
by
all
Bobsborough
.
<EOS>
The
dean
would
be
giving
his
express
sanction
to
the
marriage
,
and
so
would
Mrs.
Greystock
herself
.
<EOS>
She
knew
well
that
she
had
no
power
of
refusing
her
sanction
.
<EOS>
Frank
must
do
as
he
pleased
about
marrying
.
<EOS>
Were
Lucy
once
his
wife
,
of
course
she
would
be
made
welcome
to
the
best
the
deanery
could
give
her
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
doubt
about
Lucy
being
as
good
as
gold
;
 
only
that
real
gold
,
vile
as
it
is
,
was
the
one
thing
that
Frank
so
much
needed
.
<EOS>
The
mother
thought
that
she
had
discovered
in
her
son
something
which
seemed
to
indicate
a
possibility
that
this
very
imprudent
match
might
at
last
be
abandoned
;
and
if
there
were
such
possibility
,
surely
Lucy
ought
not
now
to
be
brought
to
the
deanery
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
if
Frank
were
to
insist
upon
her
coming
,
 
she
must
come
.
  
<EOS>
But
Mrs.
Greystock
had
a
plan
.
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
mamma
,
"
said
Ellinor
,
when
the
plan
was
proposed
to
her
,
"
do
not
you
think
that
would
be
cruel
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Cruel
,
my
dear
!
<EOS>
no
;
certainly
not
cruel
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
is
such
a
virago
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
think
that
because
Lizzie
Eustace
has
said
so
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
that
she
's
a
virago
at
all
.
<EOS>
I
believe
her
to
be
a
very
good
sort
of
woman
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
you
remember
,
mamma
,
what
the
admiral
used
to
say
of
her
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
admiral
,
my
dear
,
tried
to
borrow
her
money
,
as
he
did
everybody
's
,
and
when
she
would
n't
give
him
any
,
then
he
said
severe
things
.
<EOS>
The
poor
admiral
was
never
to
be
trusted
in
such
matters
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
Frank
would
like
it
,
"
said
Ellinor
.
<EOS>
The
plan
was
this
.
<EOS>
Lady
Linlithgow
,
who
,
through
her
brother
-
in
-
law
,
the
late
Admiral
Greystock
,
was
connected
with
the
dean
's
family
,
had
made
known
her
desire
to
have
a
new
companion
for
six
months
.
<EOS>
The
lady
was
to
be
treated
like
a
lady
,
but
was
to
have
no
salary
.
<EOS>
Her
travelling
expenses
were
to
be
paid
for
her
,
and
no
duties
were
to
be
expected
from
her
,
except
that
of
talking
and
listening
to
the
countess
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
really
think
it
's
the
very
thing
for
her
,
"
said
Mrs.
Greystock
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
not
like
being
a
governess
.
<EOS>
She
's
not
to
have
any
salary
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
whether
that
makes
it
better
,
mamma
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
would
just
be
a
visit
to
Lady
Linlithgow
.
<EOS>
It
is
that
which
makes
the
difference
,
my
dear
.
"
  
<EOS>
Ellinor
felt
sure
that
her
brother
would
not
hear
of
such
an
engagement
,
 
but
he
did
hear
of
it
,
and
,
after
various
objections
,
gave
a
sort
of
sanction
to
it
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
to
be
pressed
upon
Lucy
if
Lucy
disliked
it
.
<EOS>
Lady
Linlithgow
was
to
be
made
to
understand
that
Lucy
might
leave
whenever
she
pleased
.
<EOS>
It
was
to
be
an
invitation
,
which
Lucy
might
accept
if
she
were
so
minded
.
<EOS>
Lucy
's
position
as
an
honourable
guest
was
to
be
assured
to
her
.
<EOS>
It
was
thought
better
that
Lady
Linlithgow
should
not
be
told
of
Lucy
's
engagement
unless
she
asked
questions
;
 
or
unless
Lucy
should
choose
to
tell
her
.
<EOS>
Every
precaution
was
to
be
taken
,
and
then
Frank
gave
his
sanction
.
<EOS>
He
could
understand
,
he
said
,
that
it
might
be
inexpedient
that
Lucy
should
come
at
once
to
the
deanery
,
<EOS>
as
,
 
were
she
to
do
so
,
 
<EOS>
she
must
remain
there
till
her
marriage
,
let
the
time
be
ever
so
long
.
<EOS>
"
It
might
be
two
years
,
"
said
the
mother
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Hardly
so
long
as
that
,
"
said
the
son
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
it
would
be
 
quite
fair
 
to
papa
,
"
said
the
mother
.
<EOS>
It
was
well
that
the
argument
was
used
behind
the
dean
's
back
,
as
,
had
it
been
made
in
his
hearing
,
the
dean
would
have
upset
it
at
once
.
<EOS>
The
dean
was
so
short
-
sighted
and
imprudent
,
that
he
would
have
professed
delight
at
the
idea
of
having
Lucy
Morris
as
a
resident
at
the
deanery
.
<EOS>
Frank
acceded
to
the
argument
,
 
and
was
ashamed
of
himself
for
acceding
.
<EOS>
Ellinor
did
not
accede
,
nor
did
her
sisters
,
but
it
was
necessary
that
they
should
yield
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Greystock
at
once
wrote
to
Lady
Linlithgow
,
and
Frank
wrote
by
the
same
post
to
Lucy
Morris
.
<EOS>
"
As
there
must
be
a
year
's
delay
,
"
he
wrote
,
"
we
all
here
think
it
best
that
your
visit
to
us
should
be
postponed
for
a
while
.
<EOS>
But
if
you
object
to
the
Linlithgow
plan
,
say
so
at
once
.
<EOS>
You
shall
be
asked
to
do
nothing
disagreeable
.
"
<EOS>
He
found
the
letter
very
difficult
to
write
.
<EOS>
He
knew
that
she
ought
to
have
been
welcomed
at
once
to
Bobsborough
.
<EOS>
And
he
knew
,
too
,
the
reason
on
which
his
mother
's
objection
was
founded
.
<EOS>
But
it
might
be
two
years
before
he
could
possibly
marry
Lucy
Morris
;
 
or
it
might
be
three
.
<EOS>
Would
it
be
proper
that
she
should
be
desired
to
make
the
deanery
her
home
for
so
long
and
so
indefinite
a
time
?
<EOS>
And
when
an
engagement
was
for
so
long
,
could
it
be
well
that
everybody
should
know
it
,
 
as
everybody
would
if
Lucy
were
to
take
up
her
residence
permanently
at
the
deanery
?
<EOS>
Some
consideration
,
certainly
,
was
due
to
his
father
.
  
<EOS>
And
,
moreover
,
it
was
absolutely
necessary
that
he
and
Lizzie
Eustace
should
understand
each
other
as
to
that
mutual
pledge
of
truth
which
had
passed
between
them
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
he
received
the
following
letter
from
Messrs.
Camperdown
:

New
Square

Lincoln

DEAR
SIR
,
  
<EOS>
After
what
passed
in
our
chambers
the
other
day
,
we
think
it
best
to
let
you
know
that
we
have
been
instructed
by
the
executor
of
the
late
Sir
Florian
Eustace
to
file
a
bill
in
Chancery
against
the
widow
,
Lady
Eustace
,
for
the
recovery
of
valuable
diamonds
.
<EOS>
You
will
oblige
us
by
making
the
necessary
communication
to
her
ladyship
,
and
will
perhaps
tell
us
the
names
of
her
ladyship
's
solicitors
.
  
<EOS>
We
are
,
dear
sir
,
Your
very
obedient
servants
,
  
CAMPERDOWN
&

F.

Esq

,
M.P.
  
<EOS>
A
few
days
after
the
receipt
of
this
letter
Frank
started
for
Scotland
.
   
<EOS>
Frank
Greystock
's
Second
Visit
to
Portray
 
<EOS>
On
this
occasion
Frank
Greystock
went
down
to
Portray
Castle
with
the
intention
of
staying
at
the
house
during
the
very
short
time
that
he
would
remain
in
Scotland
.
<EOS>
He
was
going
there
solely
on
his
cousin
's
business
,
 
with
no
view
to
grouse
-
shooting
or
other
pleasure
,
and
he
purposed
remaining
but
<EOS>
a
very
short
time
,
 
perhaps
only
one
night
.
<EOS>
His
cousin
,
moreover
,
had
spoken
of
having
guests
with
her
,
in
which
case
there
could
be
no
tinge
of
impropriety
in
his
doing
so
.
<EOS>
And
whether
she
had
guests
,
or
whether
she
had
not
,
what
difference
could
it
really
make
?
<EOS>
Mr.
Andrew
Gowran
had
already
seen
what
there
was
to
see
,
and
could
do
all
the
evil
that
could
be
done
.
<EOS>
He
could
,
if
he
were
so
minded
,
spread
reports
in
the
neighbourhood
,
and
might
,
perhaps
,
have
the
power
of
communicating
what
he
had
discovered
to
the
Eustace
faction
,
 
John
Eustace
,
Mr.
Camperdown
,
and
Lord
Fawn
.
<EOS>
That
evil
,
if
it
were
an
evil
,
must
be
encountered
with
absolute
indifference
.
<EOS>
So
he
went
direct
to
the
castle
,
and
was
received
quietly
,
but
very
graciously
,
by
his
cousin
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
There
were
no
guests
then
staying
at
Portray
;
but
that
very
distinguished
lady
,
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
with
her
niece
,
Miss
Roanoke
,
had
been
there
;
as
had
also
that
very
well
-
known
nobleman
,
Lord
George
de
Bruce
Carruthers
.
<EOS>
Lord
George
and
Mrs.
Carbuncle
were
in
the
habit
of
seeing
a
good
deal
of
each
other
,
though
,
as
all
the
world
knew
,
there
was
nothing
between
them
but
the
simplest
friendship
.
<EOS>
And
Sir
Griffin
Tewett
had
also
been
there
,
a
young
baronet
who
was
supposed
to
be
enamoured
of
that
most
gorgeous
of
beauties
,
Lucinda
Roanoke
.
<EOS>
Of
all
these
grand
friends
,
 
friends
with
whom
Lizzie
had
become
acquainted
in
London
,
 
nothing
further
need
be
said
here
,
as
they
were
not
at
the
castle
when
Frank
arrived
.
<EOS>
When
he
came
,
whether
by
premeditated
plan
or
by
the
chance
of
circumstances
,
Lizzie
had
no
one
with
her
at
Portray
,
 
except
the
faithful
Macnulty
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
thought
to
have
found
you
with
all
the
world
here
,
"
said
Frank
,
 
the
faithful
Macnulty
being
then
present
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
 
we
have
had
people
,
but
only
for
a
couple
of
days
.
<EOS>
They
are
all
coming
again
,
but
not
till
November
.
<EOS>
You
hunt
;
 
do
n't
you
,
Frank
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
time
for
hunting
.
<EOS>
Why
do
you
ask
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
going
to
hunt
.
<EOS>
It
's
a
long
way
to
go
,
 
ten
or
twelve
miles
generally
;
but
almost
everybody
hunts
here
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
is
coming
again
,
and
she
is
about
the
best
lady
in
England
after
hounds
;
 
<EOS>
so
they
tell
me
.
<EOS>
And
Lord
George
is
coming
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Who
is
Lord
George
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
remember
Lord
George
Carruthers
,
whom
we
all
knew
in
London
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
,
 
the
tall
man
with
the
hollow
eyes
and
the
big
whiskers
,
whose
life
is
a
mystery
to
every
one
?
<EOS>
Is
he
coming
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
like
him
,
just
because
he
is
n't
a
ditto
to
every
man
one
meets
.
<EOS>
And
Sir
Griffin
Tewett
is
coming
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Who
is
a
ditto
to
everybody
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
;
 
yes
;
poor
Sir
Griffin
!
<EOS>
The
truth
is
,
he
is
awfully
smitten
with
Mrs.
Carbuncle
's
niece
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
you
go
match
-
making
,
Lizzie
,
"
said
Frank
.
<EOS>
"
That
Sir
Griffin
is
a
fool
,
we
will
all
allow
;
but
it
's
my
belief
<EOS>
he
has
wit
enough
to
make
himself
pass
off
as
a
man
of
fortune
,
with
very
little
to
back
it
.
<EOS>
He
's
at
law
with
his
mother
,
at
law
with
his
sisters
,
and
at
law
with
his
younger
brother
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
he
were
at
law
with
his
great
-
grandmother
,
it
would
be
nothing
to
me
,
Frank
.
<EOS>
She
has
her
aunt
to
take
care
of
her
,
and
Sir
Griffin
is
coming
with
Lord
George
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
mean
to
put
up
all
their
horses
,
Lizzie
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
not
all
.
<EOS>
Lord
George
and
Sir
Griffin
are
to
keep
theirs
at
Troon
,
or
Kilmarnock
,
or
somewhere
.
<EOS>
The
ladies
will
bring
two
apiece
,
and
I
shall
have
two
of
my
own
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
carriage
-
horses
and
hacks
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
carriage
-
horses
are
here
,
 
of
course
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
will
cost
you
a
great
deal
of
money
,
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
just
what
I
tell
her
,
"
said
Miss
Macnulty
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
've
been
living
here
,
not
spending
one
shilling
,
for
the
last
two
months
,
"
said
Lizzie
,
"
and
all
for
the
sake
of
economy
;
yet
people
think
that
no
woman
was
ever
left
so
rich
.
<EOS>
Surely
I
can
afford
to
see
a
few
friends
for
one
month
in
the
year
.
<EOS>
If
I
find
I
ca
n't
afford
so
much
as
that
,
I
shall
let
the
place
,
and
go
and
live
abroad
somewhere
.
<EOS>
It
's
too
much
to
suppose
that
a
woman
should
shut
herself
up
here
for
six
or
eight
months
and
see
nobody
all
the
time
.
"
  
<EOS>
On
that
,
the
day
of
Frank
's
arrival
,
not
a
word
was
said
about
the
necklace
,
nor
of
Lord
Fawn
,
nor
of
that
mutual
pledge
which
had
been
taken
and
given
down
among
the
rocks
.
<EOS>
Frank
,
before
dinner
,
went
out
about
the
place
,
that
he
might
see
how
things
were
going
on
,
and
observe
whether
the
widow
was
being
ill
-
treated
and
unfairly
eaten
up
by
her
dependants
.
<EOS>
He
was
,
too
,
a
little
curious
as
to
a
matter
as
to
which
his
curiosity
was
soon
relieved
.
<EOS>
He
had
hardly
reached
the
out
-
buildings
which
lay
behind
the
kitchen
-
gardens
on
his
way
to
the
Portray
woods
,
before
he
encountered
Andy
Gowran
.
<EOS>
That
faithful
adherent
of
the
family
raised
his
hand
to
his
cap
and
bobbed
his
head
,
and
then
silently
,
and
with
renewed
diligence
,
applied
himself
to
the
job
which
he
had
in
hand
.
<EOS>
The
gate
of
the
little
yard
in
which
the
cow
-
shed
stood
was
off
its
hinges
,
and
Andy
was
resetting
the
post
and
making
the
fence
tight
and
tidy
.
<EOS>
Frank
stood
a
moment
watching
him
,
and
then
asked
after
his
health
.
"
<EOS>
"
Deed
am
I
nae
that
to
boost
about
in
the
way
of
bodily
heelth
,
Muster
Greystock
.
<EOS>
I
've
just
o'er
mony
things
to
tent
to
,
to
tent
to
my
ain
sell
as
<EOS>
a
prudent
mon
ought
.
<EOS>
It
's
airly
an
'
late
wi
'
me
,
Muster
Greystock
;
and
the
lumbagy
<EOS>
just
a
'
o'er
a
mon
is
n't
the
pleasantest
freend
in
the
warld
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Frank
said
that
he
was
sorry
to
hear
so
bad
an
account
of
Mr.
Gowran
's
health
,
and
passed
on
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
for
him
to
refer
to
the
little
scene
in
which
Mr.
Gowran
had
behaved
so
badly
and
had
shaken
his
head
.
<EOS>
If
the
misbehaviour
had
been
condoned
by
Lady
Eustace
,
the
less
that
he
said
about
it
the
better
.
<EOS>
Then
he
went
on
through
the
woods
,
and
was
well
aware
that
Mr.
Gowran
's
fostering
care
had
not
been
abated
by
his
disapproval
of
his
mistress
.
<EOS>
The
fences
had
been
repaired
since
Frank
was
there
,
and
stones
had
been
laid
on
the
road
or
track
over
<EOS>
which
was
to
be
carried
away
the
under
-
wood
which
it
would
be
Lady
Eustace
's
privilege
to
cut
during
the
coming
winter
.
  
<EOS>
Frank
was
not
alone
for
one
moment
with
his
cousin
during
that
evening
,
but
in
the
presence
of
Miss
Macnulty
all
the
circumstances
of
the
necklace
were
discussed
.
<EOS>
"
Of
course
it
is
my
own
,
"
said
Lady
Eustace
,
standing
up
,
 
"
my
own
to
do
just
what
I
please
with
.
<EOS>
If
they
go
on
like
this
with
me
,
they
will
almost
tempt
me
to
sell
it
for
what
it
will
fetch
,
 
just
to
prove
to
them
that
I
can
do
so
.
<EOS>
I
have
half
a
mind
to
sell
it
,
and
then
send
them
the
money
,
and
tell
them
to
put
it
by
for
my
little
Flory
.
<EOS>
Would
not
that
serve
them
right
,
Frank
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
I
'd
do
that
,
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
not
?
<EOS>
You
always
tell
me
what
not
to
do
,
but
you
never
say
what
I
ought
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
because
I
am
so
wise
and
prudent
.
<EOS>
If
you
were
to
attempt
to
sell
the
diamonds
they
would
stop
you
,
and
would
not
give
you
credit
for
the
generous
purpose
afterwards
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
would
n't
stop
you
if
you
sold
the
ring
you
wear
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
ring
had
been
given
to
him
by
Lucy
after
their
engagement
,
and
was
the
only
present
she
had
ever
made
him
.
<EOS>
It
had
been
purchased
out
of
her
own
earnings
,
and
had
been
put
on
his
finger
by
her
own
hand
.
<EOS>
Either
from
accident
or
craft
he
had
not
worn
it
when
he
had
been
before
at
Portray
,
and
Lizzie
had
at
once
observed
it
as
a
thing
she
had
never
seen
before
.
<EOS>
She
knew
well
that
he
would
not
buy
such
a
ring
.
<EOS>
Who
had
given
him
the
ring
?
<EOS>
Frank
almost
blushed
as
he
looked
down
at
the
trinket
,
and
Lizzie
was
sure
that
it
had
been
given
by
that
sly
little
creeping
thing
,
Lucy
.
<EOS>
"
Let
me
look
at
the
ring
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
Nobody
could
stop
you
if
you
chose
to
sell
this
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Little
things
are
always
less
troublesome
than
big
things
,
"
he
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
the
price
?
<EOS>
"
she
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
in
the
market
,
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
Nor
should
your
diamonds
be
there
.
<EOS>
You
must
be
content
to
let
them
take
what
legal
steps
they
may
think
fit
,
and
defend
your
property
.
<EOS>
After
that
you
can
do
as
you
please
;
but
keep
them
safe
till
the
thing
is
settled
.
<EOS>
If
I
were
you
I
would
have
them
at
the
bankers
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Yes
;
 
and
then
when
I
asked
for
them
be
told
that
they
could
n't
be
given
up
to
me
,
because
of
Mr.
Camperdown
or
the
Lord
Chancellor
.
<EOS>
And
what
's
the
good
of
a
thing
locked
up
?
<EOS>
You
wear
your
ring
;
 
why
should
n't
I
wear
my
necklace
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
nothing
to
say
against
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
n't
that
I
care
for
such
things
.
<EOS>
Do
I
,
Julia
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
All
ladies
like
them
,
I
suppose
,
"
said
that
stupidest
and
most
stubborn
of
all
humble
friends
,
Miss
Macnulty
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
like
them
at
all
,
and
you
know
I
do
n't
.
<EOS>
I
hate
them
.
<EOS>
They
have
been
the
misery
of
my
life
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
how
they
have
tormented
me
!
<EOS>
Even
when
I
am
asleep
<EOS>
I
dream
about
them
,
and
think
that
people
steal
them
.
<EOS>
They
have
never
given
me
one
moment
's
happiness
.
<EOS>
When
I
have
them
on
I
am
always
fearing
that
Camperdown
and
Son
are
behind
me
and
are
going
to
clutch
them
.
<EOS>
And
I
think
too
well
of
myself
to
believe
that
anybody
will
care
more
for
me
because
of
a
necklace
.
<EOS>
The
only
good
they
have
ever
done
me
has
been
to
save
me
from
a
man
who
I
now
know
never
cared
for
me
.
<EOS>
But
they
are
mine
;
 
and
therefore
I
choose
to
keep
them
.
<EOS>
Though
I
am
only
a
woman
<EOS>
I
have
an
idea
of
my
own
rights
,
and
will
defend
them
as
far
as
they
go
.
<EOS>
If
you
say
I
ought
not
to
sell
them
,
Frank
,
I
'll
keep
them
;
but
I
'll
wear
them
as
commonly
as
you
do
that
gage
d'amour
which
you
carry
on
your
finger
.
<EOS>
Nobody
shall
ever
see
me
without
them
.
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
go
to
any
old
dowager
's
tea
-
party
without
them
.
<EOS>
Mr.
John
Eustace
has
chosen
to
accuse
me
of
stealing
them
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
John
Eustace
has
ever
said
a
word
about
them
,
"
said
Frank
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Camperdown
,
then
;
 
the
people
who
choose
to
call
themselves
the
guardians
and
protectors
of
my
boy
,
as
if
I
were
not
his
best
guardian
and
protector
!
<EOS>
I
'll
show
them
at
any
rate
that
I
'm
not
ashamed
of
my
booty
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
see
why
I
should
lock
them
up
in
a
musty
old
bank
.
<EOS>
Why
do
n't
you
send
your
ring
to
the
bank
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Frank
could
not
but
feel
that
she
did
it
all
very
well
.
<EOS>
In
the
first
place
she
was
very
pretty
in
the
display
of
her
half
-
mock
indignation
.
<EOS>
Though
she
used
some
strong
words
,
she
used
them
with
an
air
that
carried
them
off
and
left
no
impression
that
she
had
been
either
vulgar
or
violent
.
<EOS>
And
then
,
though
the
indignation
was
half
mock
,
it
was
also
half
real
,
and
her
courage
and
spirit
were
attractive
.
<EOS>
Greystock
had
at
last
taught
himself
to
think
that
Mr.
Camperdown
was
not
justified
in
the
claim
which
he
made
,
and
that
in
consequence
of
that
unjust
claim
Lizzie
Eustace
had
been
subjected
to
ill
-
usage
.
<EOS>
"
Did
you
ever
see
this
bone
of
contention
,
"
she
asked
;
 
"
this
fair
Helen
for
which
Greeks
and
Romans
are
to
fight
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
saw
the
necklace
,
if
you
mean
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
fetch
it
.
<EOS>
You
ought
to
see
it
,
as
you
have
to
talk
about
it
so
often
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Can
I
get
it
?
"
asked
Miss
Macnulty
.
  
<EOS>
"
Heaven
and
earth
!
<EOS>
To
suppose
that
I
should
ever
keep
them
under
less
than
seven
keys
,
and
that
there
should
be
any
of
the
locks
that
anybody
should
be
able
to
open
except
myself
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
where
are
the
seven
keys
?
"
asked
Frank
.
  
<EOS>
"
Next
to
my
heart
,
"
said
Lizzie
,
putting
her
hand
on
her
left
side
.
"
<EOS>
And
when
I
sleep
they
are
always
tied
round
my
neck
in
a
bag
,
and
the
bag
never
escapes
from
my
grasp
.
<EOS>
And
I
have
such
a
knife
under
my
pillow
,
ready
for
Mr.
Camperdown
<EOS>
should
he
come
to
seize
them
!
"
<EOS>
Then
she
ran
out
of
the
room
,
and
in
a
couple
of
minutes
returned
with
the
necklace
hanging
loose
in
her
hand
.
<EOS>
It
was
part
of
her
little
play
to
show
by
her
speed
that
the
close
locking
of
the
jewels
was
a
joke
,
and
that
the
ornament
,
precious
as
it
was
,
received
at
her
hands
no
other
treatment
than
might
any
indifferent
feminine
bauble
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
within
those
two
minutes
she
had
contrived
to
unlock
the
heavy
iron
case
which
always
stood
beneath
the
foot
of
her
bed
.
<EOS>
"
There
,
"
she
said
,
chucking
the
necklace
across
the
table
to
Frank
,
so
that
he
was
barely
able
to
catch
it
.
<EOS>
"
There
is
ten
thousand
pounds
"
worth
,
as
they
tell
me
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
you
will
not
believe
me
when
I
say
that
I
should
have
the
greatest
satisfaction
in
the
world
in
throwing
them
out
among
those
blue
waves
yonder
,
did
I
not
think
that
Camperdown
and
Son
would
fish
them
up
again
.
"
  
<EOS>
Frank
spread
the
necklace
on
the
table
,
and
stood
up
to
look
at
it
,
while
Miss
Macnulty
came
and
gazed
at
the
jewels
over
his
shoulder
.
"
<EOS>
And
that
is
worth
ten
thousand
pounds
,
"
said
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
people
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
your
husband
gave
it
you
just
as
another
man
gives
a
trinket
that
costs
ten
shillings
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Just
as
Lucy
Morris
gave
you
that
ring
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
smiled
,
but
took
no
other
notice
of
the
accusation
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
so
poor
a
man
,
"
said
he
,
"
that
this
string
of
stones
,
which
you
throw
about
the
room
like
a
child
's
toy
,
would
be
the
making
of
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Take
it
and
be
made
,
"
said
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
seems
an
awful
thing
to
me
to
have
so
much
value
in
my
hands
,
"
said
Miss
Macnulty
,
who
had
lifted
the
necklace
off
the
table
.
<EOS>
"
It
would
buy
an
estate
;
would
n't
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
would
buy
the
honourable
estate
of
matrimony
if
it
belonged
to
many
women
,
"
said
Lizzie
,
 
"
<EOS>
but
it
has
n't
had
just
that
effect
with
me
;
 
<EOS>
has
it
,
Frank
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
n't
used
it
with
that
view
yet
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Will
you
have
it
,
Frank
?
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
Take
it
with
all
its
encumbrances
and
weight
of
cares
.
<EOS>
Take
it
with
all
the
burthen
of
Messrs.
Camperdown
's
lawsuits
upon
it
.
<EOS>
You
shall
be
as
welcome
to
it
as
flowers
were
ever
welcomed
in
<EOS>
May.
"
  
"
The
encumbrances
are
too
heavy
,
"
said
Frank
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
prefer
a
little
ring
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
much
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
doubt
but
<EOS>
you
're
right
,
"
said
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Who
fears
to
rise
will
hardly
get
a
fall
.
<EOS>
But
there
they
are
for
you
to
look
at
,
and
there
they
shall
remain
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
.
"
<EOS>
So
saying
,
she
clasped
the
string
round
Miss
Macnulty
's
throat
.
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
feel
,
Julia
,
with
an
estate
upon
your
neck
?
<EOS>
Five
hundred
acres
at
twenty
pounds
an
acre
.
<EOS>
Let
us
call
it
five
hundred
pounds
a
year
.
<EOS>
That
's
about
it
.
"
<EOS>
Miss
Macnulty
looked
as
though
she
did
not
like
it
,
but
she
stood
for
a
time
bearing
the
precious
burthen
,
while
Frank
explained
to
his
cousin
that
she
could
hardly
buy
land
to
pay
her
five
per
cent
.
<EOS>
They
were
then
taken
off
and
left
lying
on
the
table
till
Lady
Eustace
took
them
with
her
as
she
went
to
bed
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
feel
so
like
some
naughty
person
in
the
"
Arabian
Nights
,
"
"
she
said
,
"
who
has
got
some
great
treasure
that
always
brings
him
into
trouble
;
but
he
ca
n't
get
rid
of
it
,
because
some
spirit
has
given
it
to
him
.
<EOS>
At
last
some
morning
it
turns
into
slate
stones
,
and
then
he
has
to
be
a
water
-
carrier
,
and
is
happy
ever
afterwards
,
and
marries
the
king
's
daughter
.
<EOS>
What
sort
of
a
king
's
son
will
there
be
for
me
when
this
turns
into
slate
stones
?
<EOS>
Good
night
,
Frank
.
<EOS>
"
Then
she
went
off
with
her
diamonds
and
her
bed
-
candle
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
following
day
Frank
suggested
that
there
should
be
a
business
conversation
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
That
means
that
I
am
to
sit
silent
and
obedient
while
you
lecture
me
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
But
she
submitted
,
and
they
went
together
into
the
little
sitting
-
room
which
looked
out
over
the
sea
,
 
the
room
where
she
kept
her
Shelley
and
her
Byron
,
and
practised
her
music
and
did
water
-
colours
,
and
sat
,
sometimes
,
dreaming
of
a
Corsair
.
"
<EOS>
And
now
,
my
gravest
of
Mentors
,
what
must
a
poor
ignorant
female
<EOS>
Telemachus
do
,
so
that
the
world
may
not
trample
on
her
too
heavily
?
"
<EOS>
He
began
by
telling
her
what
had
happened
between
himself
and
Lord
Fawn
,
and
recommended
her
to
write
to
that
unhappy
nobleman
,
returning
any
present
that
she
might
have
received
from
him
,
and
expressing
,
with
some
mild
but
intelligible
sarcasm
,
her
regret
that
their
paths
should
have
crossed
each
other
.
<EOS>
"
I
've
worse
in
store
for
his
lordship
than
that
,
"
said
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
mean
by
any
personal
interview
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Certainly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
are
wrong
,
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
you
do
.
<EOS>
Men
have
become
so
soft
themselves
,
that
they
no
longer
dare
to
think
even
of
punishing
those
who
behave
badly
,
and
they
expect
women
to
be
softer
and
more
fainéant
than
themselves
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
ill
-
used
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Certainly
you
have
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
I
will
be
revenged
.
<EOS>
Look
here
,
Frank
;
if
your
view
of
these
things
is
altogether
different
from
mine
,
let
us
drop
the
subject
.
<EOS>
Of
all
living
human
beings
you
are
the
one
that
is
most
to
me
now
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
you
are
more
than
any
other
ever
was
.
<EOS>
But
,
even
for
you
,
I
can
not
alter
my
nature
.
<EOS>
Even
for
you
I
would
not
alter
it
if
I
could
.
<EOS>
That
man
has
injured
me
,
and
all
the
world
knows
it
.
<EOS>
I
will
have
my
revenge
,
and
all
the
world
shall
know
that
.
<EOS>
I
did
wrong
;
 
<EOS>
I
am
sensible
enough
of
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
wrong
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
told
a
man
whom
I
never
loved
that
I
would
marry
him
.
<EOS>
God
knows
that
I
have
been
punished
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
,
Lizzie
,
it
is
better
as
it
is
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
great
deal
better
.
<EOS>
I
will
tell
you
now
that
I
could
never
induce
myself
to
go
into
church
with
that
man
as
his
bride
.
<EOS>
With
a
man
I
did
n't
love
I
might
have
done
so
,
but
not
with
a
man
I
despised
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
been
saved
,
then
,
from
a
greater
evil
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
 
but
not
the
less
is
his
injury
to
me
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
because
he
despises
me
that
he
rejects
me
;
 
nor
is
it
because
he
thought
that
I
had
taken
property
that
was
not
my
own
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
then
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Because
he
was
afraid
the
world
would
say
that
I
had
done
so
.
<EOS>
Poor
shallow
creature
!
<EOS>
But
he
shall
be
punished
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
how
you
can
punish
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Leave
that
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
another
thing
to
do
much
more
difficult
.
"
<EOS>
She
paused
,
looking
for
a
moment
up
into
his
face
,
and
then
turning
her
eyes
upon
the
ground
.
<EOS>
As
he
said
nothing
,
she
went
on
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
to
excuse
myself
to
you
for
having
accepted
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
never
blamed
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
in
words
.
<EOS>
How
should
you
?
<EOS>
But
if
you
have
not
blamed
me
in
your
heart
,
I
despise
you
.
<EOS>
I
know
you
have
.
<EOS>
I
have
seen
it
in
your
eyes
when
you
have
counselled
me
,
either
to
take
the
poor
creature
or
to
leave
him
.
<EOS>
Speak
out
,
now
,
like
a
man
.
<EOS>
Is
it
not
so
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
thought
you
loved
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Loved
him
!
<EOS>
Is
there
anything
in
him
or
about
him
that
a
woman
could
love
?
<EOS>
Is
he
not
a
poor
social
stick
;
 
a
bit
of
half
-
dead
wood
,
good
to
make
a
post
of
,
if
one
wants
a
post
?
<EOS>
I
did
want
a
post
so
sorely
then
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
see
why
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
It
was
natural
that
you
should
be
inclined
to
marry
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Natural
that
I
should
be
inclined
to
marry
again
!
<EOS>
And
is
that
all
?
<EOS>
It
is
hard
sometimes
to
see
whether
men
are
thick
-
witted
,
or
hypocrites
<EOS>
so
perfect
that
they
seem
to
be
so
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
bring
myself
to
think
you
thick
-
witted
,
Frank
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
I
must
be
the
perfect
hypocrite
,
 
of
course
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
believed
I
accepted
Lord
Fawn
because
it
was
natural
that
I
should
wish
to
marry
again
!
<EOS>
Frank
,
you
believed
nothing
of
the
kind
.
<EOS>
I
accepted
him
in
my
anger
,
in
my
misery
,
in
my
despair
,
because
I
had
expected
you
to
come
to
me
,
 
<EOS>
and
you
had
not
come
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
had
thrown
herself
now
into
a
chair
,
and
sat
looking
at
him
.
<EOS>
"
You
had
told
me
that
you
would
come
,
and
you
had
stayed
away
.
<EOS>
It
was
you
,
Frank
,
that
I
wanted
to
punish
then
;
 
but
there
was
no
punishment
in
it
for
you
.
<EOS>
When
is
it
to
be
,
Frank
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
When
is
what
to
be
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
,
in
a
low
voice
,
all
but
dumb
-
founded
.
<EOS>
How
was
he
to
put
an
end
to
this
conversation
,
and
what
was
he
to
say
to
her
?
  
<EOS>
"
Your
marriage
with
that
little
wizened
thing
who
gave
you
the
ring
 
<EOS>
that
prim
morsel
of
feminine
propriety
who
has
been
clever
enough
to
make
you
believe
that
her
morality
would
suffice
to
make
you
happy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
hear
Lucy
Morris
abused
,
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
that
abuse
?
<EOS>
Is
it
abuse
to
say
that
she
is
moral
and
proper
?
<EOS>
But
,
sir
,
I
shall
abuse
her
.
<EOS>
I
know
her
for
what
she
is
,
while
your
eyes
are
sealed
.
<EOS>
She
is
wise
and
moral
,
and
decorous
and
prim
;
but
she
is
a
hypocrite
,
and
has
no
touch
of
real
heart
in
her
composition
.
<EOS>
Not
abuse
her
when
she
has
robbed
me
of
all
 
all
 
all
that
I
have
in
the
world
!
<EOS>
Go
to
her
.
<EOS>
You
had
better
go
at
once
.
<EOS>
I
did
not
mean
to
say
all
this
,
but
it
has
been
said
,
and
you
must
leave
me
.
<EOS>
I
,
at
any
rate
,
can
not
play
the
hypocrite
;
 
I
wish
I
could
.
"
<EOS>
He
rose
and
came
to
her
,
and
attempted
to
take
her
hand
,
but
she
flung
away
from
him
.
"
<EOS>
No
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
 
"
never
again
;
never
,
unless
you
will
tell
me
that
the
promise
you
made
me
when
we
were
down
on
the
sea
-
shore
was
a
true
promise
.
<EOS>
Was
that
truth
,
sir
,
or
was
it
a
 
lie
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Lizzie
,
do
not
use
such
a
word
as
that
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
stand
picking
my
words
when
the
whole
world
is
going
round
with
me
,
and
my
very
brain
is
on
fire
.
<EOS>
What
is
it
to
me
what
my
words
are
?
<EOS>
Say
one
syllable
to
me
,
and
every
word
I
utter
again
while
breath
is
mine
shall
be
spoken
to
do
you
pleasure
.
<EOS>
If
you
can
not
say
it
,
it
is
nothing
to
me
what
you
or
any
one
may
think
of
my
words
.
<EOS>
You
know
my
secret
,
and
I
care
not
who
else
knows
it
.
<EOS>
At
any
rate
,
I
can
die
!
"
<EOS>
Then
she
paused
a
moment
,
and
after
that
stalked
steadily
out
of
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
That
afternoon
Frank
took
a
long
walk
by
himself
over
the
mountains
,
nearly
to
the
Cottage
and
back
again
;
and
on
his
return
was
informed
that
Lady
Eustace
was
ill
,
and
had
gone
to
bed
.
<EOS>
At
any
rate
,
she
was
too
unwell
to
come
down
to
dinner
.
<EOS>
He
,
therefore
,
and
Miss
Macnulty
sat
down
to
dine
,
and
passed
the
evening
together
without
other
companionship
.
<EOS>
Frank
had
resolved
during
his
walk
that
he
would
leave
Portray
the
next
day
;
but
had
hardly
resolved
upon
anything
else
.
<EOS>
One
thing
,
however
,
seemed
certain
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
was
engaged
to
marry
Lucy
Morris
,
and
to
that
engagement
he
must
be
true
.
<EOS>
His
cousin
was
very
charming
,
 
and
had
never
looked
so
lovely
in
his
eyes
as
when
she
had
been
confessing
her
love
for
him
.
<EOS>
And
he
had
wondered
at
and
admired
her
courage
,
her
power
of
language
,
and
her
force
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
quite
forget
how
useful
would
be
her
income
to
him
.
<EOS>
And
,
added
to
this
,
there
was
present
to
him
an
unwholesome
feeling
,
 
ideas
absolutely
at
variance
with
those
better
ideas
which
had
prompted
him
when
he
was
writing
his
offer
to
Lucy
Morris
in
his
chambers
,
 
that
a
woman
such
as
was
his
cousin
Lizzie
was
fitter
to
be
the
wife
of
a
man
thrown
,
as
he
must
be
,
into
the
world
,
than
a
dear
,
quiet
,
domestic
little
girl
such
as
Lucy
Morris
.
<EOS>
But
to
Lucy
Morris
he
was
engaged
,
and
therefore
there
was
an
end
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
The
next
morning
he
sent
his
love
to
his
cousin
,
asking
whether
he
should
see
her
before
he
went
.
<EOS>
It
was
still
necessary
that
he
should
know
what
attorneys
to
employ
on
her
behalf
if
the
threatened
bill
were
filed
by
Messrs.
Camperdown
.
<EOS>
Then
he
suggested
a
firm
in
his
note
.
<EOS>
Might
he
put
the
case
into
the
hands
of
Mr.
Townsend
,
who
was
a
friend
of
his
own
?
<EOS>
There
came
back
to
him
a
scrap
of
paper
,
an
old
envelope
,
on
which
were
written
the
names
of
Mowbray
and
Mopus
;
 
Mowbray
and
Mopus
in
a
large
scrawling
hand
,
and
with
pencil
.
<EOS>
He
put
the
scrap
of
paper
into
his
pocket
,
feeling
that
he
could
not
remonstrate
with
her
at
this
moment
,
and
was
prepared
to
depart
,
when
there
came
a
message
to
him
.
<EOS>
Lady
Eustace
was
still
unwell
,
but
had
risen
;
and
if
it
were
not
giving
him
too
much
trouble
,
would
see
him
before
he
went
.
<EOS>
He
followed
the
messenger
to
the
same
little
room
,
looking
out
upon
the
sea
,
and
then
found
her
,
dressed
indeed
,
but
with
a
white
morning
wrapper
on
,
and
with
hair
loose
over
her
shoulders
.
<EOS>
Her
eyes
were
red
with
weeping
,
and
her
face
was
pale
,
and
thin
,
and
woe
-
begone
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
so
sorry
that
you
are
ill
,
Lizzie
,
"
he
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
am
ill
;
 
sometimes
very
ill
;
but
what
does
it
matter
?
<EOS>
I
did
not
send
for
you
,
Frank
,
to
speak
of
aught
so
trivial
as
that
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
favour
to
ask
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
I
will
grant
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
your
forgiveness
for
my
conduct
yesterday
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Lizzie
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Say
that
you
forgive
me
.
<EOS>
Say
it
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
can
I
forgive
where
there
has
been
no
fault
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
has
been
fault
.
<EOS>
Say
that
you
forgive
me
.
"
<EOS>
And
she
stamped
her
foot
as
she
demanded
his
pardon
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
forgive
you
,
"
he
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
now
,
one
farewell
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
then
threw
herself
upon
his
breast
and
kissed
him
.
"
<EOS>
Now
,
go
,
"
she
said
;
"
go
,
and
come
no
more
to
me
,
unless
you
would
see
me
mad
.
<EOS>
May
God
Almighty
bless
you
,
and
make
you
happy
!
"
<EOS>
As
she
uttered
this
prayer
she
held
the
door
in
her
hand
,
and
there
was
nothing
for
him
but
to
leave
her
.
   
<EOS>
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Hittaway
in
Scotland
 
<EOS>
A
great
many
people
go
to
Scotland
in
the
autumn
.
<EOS>
When
you
have
your
autumn
holiday
in
hand
to
dispose
of
it
,
there
is
nothing
more
aristocratic
that
you
can
do
than
go
to
Scotland
.
<EOS>
Dukes
are
more
plentiful
there
than
in
Pall
Mall
,
and
you
will
meet
an
earl
or
at
least
a
lord
on
every
mountain
.
<EOS>
Of
course
,
if
you
merely
travel
about
from
inn
to
inn
,
and
neither
have
a
moor
of
your
own
nor
stay
with
any
great
friend
,
you
do
n't
quite
enjoy
the
cream
of
it
;
but
to
go
to
Scotland
in
August
and
stay
there
,
perhaps
,
till
the
end
of
September
,
is
about
the
most
certain
step
you
can
take
towards
autumnal
fashion
.
<EOS>
Switzerland
and
the
Tyrol
,
and
even
Italy
,
are
all
redolent
of
Mr.
Cook
,
and
in
those
beautiful
lands
you
become
subject
at
least
to
suspicion
.
  
<EOS>
By
no
persons
was
the
duty
of
adhering
to
the
best
side
of
society
more
clearly
appreciated
than
by
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Hittaway
of
Warwick
Square
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Hittaway
was
Chairman
of
the
Board
of
Civil
Appeals
,
and
was
a
man
who
quite
understood
that
there
are
chairmen
 
and
chairmen
.
<EOS>
He
could
name
to
you
three
or
four
men
holding
responsible
permanent
official
positions
quite
as
good
as
that
he
filled
in
regard
to
salary
,
 
<EOS>
which
,
as
he
often
said
of
his
own
,
was
a
mere
nothing
,
just
a
poor
two
thousand
pounds
a
year
,
not
as
much
as
a
grocer
would
make
in
a
decent
business
,
 
but
they
were
simply
head
clerks
and
nothing
more
.
<EOS>
Nobody
knew
anything
of
them
.
<EOS>
They
had
no
names
.
<EOS>
You
did
not
meet
them
anywhere
.
<EOS>
Cabinet
ministers
never
heard
of
them
;
and
nobody
out
of
their
own
offices
ever
consulted
them
.
<EOS>
But
there
are
others
,
and
Mr.
Hittaway
felt
greatly
conscious
that
he
was
one
of
them
,
who
move
altogether
in
a
different
sphere
.
<EOS>
One
minister
of
State
would
ask
another
whether
Hittaway
had
been
consulted
on
this
or
on
that
measure
;
 
so
at
least
the
Hittawayites
were
in
the
habit
of
reporting
.
<EOS>
The
names
of
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Hittaway
were
constantly
in
the
papers
.
<EOS>
They
were
invited
to
evening
gatherings
at
the
houses
of
both
the
alternate
Prime
Ministers
.
<EOS>
They
were
to
be
seen
at
fashionable
gatherings
up
the
river
.
<EOS>
They
attended
concerts
at
Buckingham
Palace
.
<EOS>
Once
a
year
they
gave
a
dinner
-
party
which
was
inserted
in
the
"
Morning
Post
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
On
such
occasions
at
least
one
Cabinet
Minister
always
graced
the
board
.
<EOS>
In
fact
,
Mr.
Hittaway
,
as
Chairman
of
the
Board
of
Civil
Appeals
,
was
somebody
;
and
Mrs.
Hittaway
,
as
his
wife
and
as
sister
to
a
peer
,
was
somebody
also
.
<EOS>
The
reader
will
remember
that
Mrs.
Hittaway
had
been
a
Fawn
before
she
married
.
  
<EOS>
There
is
this
drawback
upon
the
happy
condition
which
Mr.
Hittaway
had
achieved
,
 
that
it
demands
a
certain
expenditure
.
<EOS>
Let
nobody
dream
that
he
can
be
somebody
without
having
to
pay
for
that
honour
;
 
unless
,
indeed
,
he
be
a
clergyman
.
<EOS>
When
you
go
to
a
concert
at
Buckingham
Palace
you
pay
nothing
,
it
is
true
,
for
your
ticket
;
and
a
Cabinet
Minister
dining
with
you
does
not
eat
or
drink
more
than
your
old
friend
Jones
the
attorney
.
<EOS>
But
in
some
insidious
,
unforeseen
manner
,
 
in
a
way
that
can
only
be
understood
after
much
experience
,
 
these
luxuries
of
fashion
do
make
a
heavy
pull
on
a
modest
income
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Hittaway
knew
this
thoroughly
,
having
much
experience
,
and
did
make
her
fight
bravely
.
<EOS>
For
Mr.
Hittaway
's
income
was
no
more
than
modest
.
<EOS>
A
few
thousand
pounds
he
had
of
his
own
when
he
married
,
and
his
Clara
had
brought
to
him
the
unpretending
sum
of
fifteen
hundred
.
<EOS>
But
,
beyond
that
,
the
poor
official
salary
,
 
which
was
less
than
what
a
decent
grocer
would
make
,
 
was
their
all
.
<EOS>
The
house
in
Warwick
Square
they
had
prudently
purchased
on
their
marriage
,
 
when
houses
in
Warwick
Square
were
cheaper
than
they
are
now
,
 
and
there
they
carried
on
their
battle
,
certainly
with
success
.
<EOS>
But
two
thousand
a
year
does
not
go
very
far
in
Warwick
Square
,
even
though
you
sit
rent
free
,
if
you
have
a
family
and
absolutely
must
keep
a
carriage
.
<EOS>
It
therefore
resulted
that
when
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Hittaway
went
to
Scotland
,
which
they
would
endeavour
to
do
every
year
,
it
was
very
important
that
they
should
accomplish
their
aristocratic
holiday
as
visitors
at
the
house
of
some
aristocratic
friend
.
<EOS>
So
well
had
they
played
their
cards
in
this
respect
,
that
they
seldom
failed
altogether
.
<EOS>
In
one
year
they
had
been
the
guests
of
a
great
marquis
quite
in
the
north
,
and
that
had
been
a
very
glorious
year
.
<EOS>
To
talk
of
Stackallan
was
,
indeed
,
a
thing
of
beauty
.
<EOS>
But
in
that
year
Mr.
Hittaway
had
made
himself
very
useful
in
London
.
<EOS>
Since
that
they
had
been
at
delicious
shooting
lodges
in
Ross
and
Inverness
-
shire
,
had
visited
a
millionaire
at
his
palace
amidst
the
Argyle
mountains
,
had
been
fêted
in
a
western
island
,
had
been
bored
by
a
Dundee
dowager
,
and
put
up
with
a
Lothian
laird
.
<EOS>
But
the
thing
had
been
almost
always
done
,
and
the
Hittaways
were
known
as
people
that
went
to
Scotland
.
<EOS>
He
could
handle
a
gun
,
and
was
clever
enough
never
to
shoot
a
keeper
.
<EOS>
She
could
read
aloud
,
could
act
a
little
,
could
talk
or
hold
her
tongue
;
and
let
her
hosts
be
who
they
would
and
as
mighty
as
you
please
,
never
caused
them
trouble
by
seeming
to
be
out
of
their
circle
,
and
on
that
account
requiring
peculiar
attention
.
  
<EOS>
On
this
occasion
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Hittaway
were
the
guests
of
old
Lady
Pierrepoint
,
in
Dumfries
.
<EOS>
There
was
nothing
special
to
recommend
Lady
Pierrepoint
except
that
she
had
a
large
house
and
a
good
income
,
and
that
she
liked
to
have
people
with
her
of
whom
everybody
knew
something
.
<EOS>
So
far
was
Lady
Pierrepoint
from
being
high
in
the
Hittaway
world
,
that
Mrs.
Hittaway
felt
herself
called
upon
to
explain
to
her
friends
that
she
was
forced
to
go
to
Dumdum
House
by
the
duties
of
old
friendship
.
<EOS>
Dear
old
Lady
Pierrepoint
had
been
insisting
on
it
for
the
last
ten
years
.
<EOS>
And
there
was
this
advantage
,
that
Dumfriesshire
is
next
to
Ayrshire
,
that
Dumdum
was
not
very
far
,
 
some
twenty
or
thirty
miles
,
 
from
Portray
,
and
that
she
might
learn
something
about
Lizzie
Eustace
in
her
country
house
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
nearly
the
end
of
August
when
the
Hittaways
left
London
to
stay
an
entire
month
with
Lady
Pierrepoint
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Hittaway
had
very
frequently
explained
his
defalcation
as
to
fashion
,
 
in
that
he
was
remaining
in
London
for
three
weeks
after
Parliament
had
broken
up
,
 
by
the
peculiar
exigencies
of
the
Board
of
Appeals
in
that
year
.
<EOS>
To
one
or
two
very
intimate
friends
Mrs.
Hittaway
had
hinted
that
everything
must
be
made
to
give
way
to
this
horrid
business
of
Fawn
's
marriage
.
<EOS>
"
Whatever
happens
,
and
at
whatever
cost
,
that
must
be
stopped
,
"
she
had
ventured
to
say
to
Lady
Glencora
Palliser
,
 
who
,
however
,
could
hardly
be
called
one
of
her
very
intimate
friends
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
see
it
at
all
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
Lady
Eustace
is
very
nice
.
<EOS>
And
why
should
n't
she
marry
Lord
Fawn
if
she
's
engaged
to
him
?
"
<EOS>
"
But
you
have
heard
of
the
necklace
,
Lady
Glencora
?
"
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
've
heard
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
wish
anybody
would
come
to
me
and
try
and
get
my
diamonds
!
<EOS>
They
should
hear
what
I
would
say
.
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Hittaway
greatly
admired
Lady
Glencora
,
but
not
the
less
was
she
determined
to
persevere
.
  
<EOS>
Had
Lord
Fawn
been
altogether
candid
and
open
with
his
family
at
this
time
,
some
trouble
might
have
been
saved
;
for
he
had
almost
altogether
resolved
that
,
let
the
consequences
be
what
they
might
,
he
would
not
marry
Lizzie
Eustace
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
afraid
to
say
this
even
to
his
own
sister
.
<EOS>
He
had
promised
to
marry
the
woman
,
and
he
must
walk
very
warily
,
or
the
objurgations
of
the
world
would
be
too
many
for
him
.
<EOS>
"
It
must
depend
altogether
on
her
conduct
,
Clara
,
"
he
had
said
when
last
his
sister
had
persecuted
him
on
the

.
<EOS>
She
was
not
,
however
,
sorry
to
have
an
opportunity
of
learning
something
of
the
lady
's
doings
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Hittaway
had
more
than
once
called
on
Mr.
Camperdown
.
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
Mr.
Camperdown
had
said
in
answer
to
a
question
from
Lord
Fawn
's
brother
-
in
-
law
;
"
she
would
play
old
gooseberry
with
the
property
if
we
had
n't
some
one
to
look
after
it
.
<EOS>
There
's
a
fellow
named
Gowran
who
has
lived
there
all
his
life
,
and
we
depend
very
much
upon
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
is
certainly
true
,
that
as
to
many
points
of
conduct
,
women
are
less
nice
than
men
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Hittaway
would
not
probably
have
condescended
himself
to
employ
espionage
,
but
Mrs.
Hittaway
was
less
scrupulous
.
<EOS>
She
actually
went
down
to
Troon
and
had
an
interview
with
Mr.
Gowran
,
using
freely
the
names
of
Mr.
Camperdown
and
of
Lord
Fawn
;
and
some
ten
days
afterwards
Mr.
Gowran
travelled
as
far
as
Dumfries
,
and
Dumdum
,
and
had
an
interview
with
Mrs.
Hittaway
.
<EOS>
The
result
of
all
this
,
and
of
further
inquiries
,
will
be
shown
by
the
following
letter
from
Mrs.
Hittaway
to
her
sister
Amelia
:
    
Dumdum
,
9th
September

MY
DEAR
AMELIA
,
  
<EOS>
Here
we
are
,
and
here
we
have
to
remain
to
the
end
of
the
month
.
<EOS>
Of
course
it
suits
,
and
all
that
;
but
it
is
awfully
dull
.
<EOS>
Richmond
for
this
time
of
the
year
is
a
paradise
to
it
;
and
as
for
coming
to
Scotland
every
autumn
,
I
am
sick
of
it
.
<EOS>
Only
what
is
one
to
do
if
one
lives
in
London
?
<EOS>
If
it
was
n't
for
Orlando
and
the
children
,
I
'd
brazen
it
out
,
and
let
people
say
what
they
pleased
.
<EOS>
As
for
health
,
I
'm
never
so
well
as
at
home
,
and
I
do
like
having
my
own
things
about
me
.
<EOS>
Orlando
has
literally
nothing
to
do
here
.
<EOS>
There
is
no
shooting
,
except
pheasants
,
and
that
does
n't
begin
till
October
.
  
<EOS>
But
I
'm
very
glad
I
've
come
as
to
Frederic
,
and
the
more
so
,
as
I
have
learned
the
truth
as
to
that
Mr.
Greystock
.
<EOS>
She
,
Lady
Eustace
,
is
a
bad
creature
in
every
way
.
<EOS>
She
still
pretends
that
she
is
engaged
to
Frederic
,
and
tells
everybody
that
the
marriage
is
not
broken
off
,
and
yet
she
has
her
cousin
with
her
,
making
love
to
him
in
the
most
indecent
way
.
<EOS>
People
used
to
say
in
her
favour
that
at
any
rate
she
never
flirted
.
<EOS>
I
never
quite
know
what
people
mean
when
they
talk
of
flirting
.
<EOS>
But
you
may
take
my
word
for
it
that
she
allows
her
cousin
to
embrace
her
,
and
_
embraces
him
_
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
say
it
if
I
could
not
prove
it
.
<EOS>
It
is
horrible
to
think
of
it
,
when
one
remembers
that
she
is
almost
justified
in
saying
that
Frederic
is
engaged
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
No
doubt
he
was
engaged
to
her
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
great
misfortune
,
but
,
thank
God
,
is
not
yet
past
remedy
.
<EOS>
He
has
some
foolish
feeling
of
what
he
calls
honour
;
as
if
a
man
can
be
bound
in
honour
to
marry
a
woman
who
has
deceived
him
in
every
point
!
<EOS>
She
still
sticks
to
the
diamonds
,
 
if
she
has
not
sold
them
,
as
I
believe
she
has
;
and
Mr.
Camperdown
is
going
to
bring
an
action
against
her
in
the
High
Court
of
Chancery
.
<EOS>
But
still
Frederic
will
not
absolutely
declare
the
thing
off
.
<EOS>
I
feel
,
therefore
,
that
it
is
my
duty
to
let
him
know
what
I
have
learned
.
<EOS>
I
should
be
the
last
to
stir
in
such
a
matter
unless
I
was
sure
I
could
prove
it
.
<EOS>
But
I
do
n't
quite
like
to
write
to
Frederic
.
<EOS>
Will
mamma
see
him
,
and
tell
him
what
I
say
?
<EOS>
Of
course
you
will
show
this
letter
to
mamma
.
<EOS>
If
not
,
I
must
postpone
it
till
I
am
in
town
;
 
but
I
think
it
would
come
better
from
mamma
.
<EOS>
Mamma
may
be
sure
that
she
is
a
bad
woman
.
  
<EOS>
And
now
what
do
you
think
of
your
Mr.
Greystock
?
<EOS>
As
sure
as
I
am
here
he
was
seen
with
his
arm
<EOS>
round
his
cousin
's
waist
,
sitting
out
of
doors
,
 
_
kissing
her
!
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
I
was
never
taken
in
by
that
story
of
his
marrying
Lucy
Morris
.
<EOS>
He
is
the
last
man
in
the
world
to
marry
a
governess
.
<EOS>
He
is
over
head
and
ears
in
debt
,
and
if
he
marries
at
all
,
he
must
marry
some
one
with
money
.
<EOS>
I
really
think
that
mamma
,
and
you
,
and
all
of
you
have
been
soft
about
that
girl
.
<EOS>
I
believe
she
has
been
a
good
governess
,
 
that
is
,
good
after
mamma
's
easy
fashion
;
and
I
do
n't
for
a
moment
suppose
that
she
is
doing
anything
underhand
.
<EOS>
But
a
governess
with
a
lover
never
does
suit
,
and
I
'm
sure
it
wo
n't
suit
in
this
case
.
<EOS>
If
I
were
you
I
would
tell
her
.
<EOS>
I
think
it
would
be
the
best
charity
.
<EOS>
Whether
they
mean
to
marry
I
ca
n't
tell
,
 
Mr.
Greystock
,
that
is
,
and
this
woman
;
_
<EOS>
but
they
ought
to
mean
it
_
;
 
<EOS>
that
's
all
.
  
<EOS>
Let
me
know
at
once
whether
mamma
will
see
Frederic
,
and
speak
to
him
openly
.
<EOS>
She
is
quite
at
liberty
to
use
my
name
;
only
nobody
but
mamma
should
see
this
letter
.
  
<EOS>
Love
to
them
all
,
Your
most
affectionate
sister
,
  
CLARA
HITTAWAY
.
  
<EOS>
In
writing
to
Amelia
instead
of
to
her
mother
,
Mrs.
Hittaway
was
sure
that
she
was
communicating
her
ideas
to
at
least
two
persons
at
Fawn
Court
,
and
that
therefore
there
would
be
discussion
.
<EOS>
Had
she
written
to
her
mother
,
her
mother
might
probably
have
held
her
peace
,
and
done
nothing
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
Wo
n't
Be
True
"
 
Mrs.
Greystock
,
in
making
her
proposition
respecting
Lady
Linlithgow
,
wrote
to
Lady
Fawn
,
and
by
the
same
post
Frank
wrote
to
Lucy
.
<EOS>
But
before
those
letters
reached
Fawn
Court
there
had
come
that
other
dreadful
letter
from
Mrs.
Hittaway
.
<EOS>
The
consternation
caused
at
Fawn
Court
in
respect
to
Mr.
Greystock
's
treachery
almost
robbed
of
its
importance
the
suggestion
made
as
to
Lord
Fawn
.
<EOS>
Could
it
be
possible
that
this
man
,
who
had
so
openly
and
in
so
manly
a
manner
engaged
himself
to
Lucy
Morris
,
should
now
be
proposing
to
himself
a
marriage
with
his
rich
cousin
?
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
did
not
believe
that
it
was
possible
.
<EOS>
Clara
had
not
seen
those
horrid
things
with
her
own
eyes
,
and
other
people
might
be
liars
.
<EOS>
But
Amelia
shook
her
head
.
<EOS>
Amelia
evidently
believed
that
all
manner
of
iniquities
were
possible
to
man
.
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
mamma
,
the
sacrifice
he
was
making
was
so
very
great
!
"
<EOS>
"
But
he
made
it
!
"
pleaded
Lady
Fawn
.
"
<EOS>
No
,
mamma
,
he
said
he
would
make
it
.
<EOS>
Men
do
these
things
.
<EOS>
It
is
very
horrid
,
but
I
think
they
do
them
more
now
than
they
used
to
.
<EOS>
It
seems
to
me
that
nobody
cares
now
what
he
does
,
if
he
's
not
to
be
put
into
prison
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
resolved
between
these
two
wise
ones
that
nothing
at
the
present
should
be
said
to
Lucy
or
to
any
one
of
the
family
.
<EOS>
They
would
wait
awhile
,
and
in
the
meantime
they
attempted
,
 
as
far
as
it
was
possible
to
make
the
attempt
without
express
words
,
 
to
let
Lucy
understand
that
she
might
remain
at
Fawn
Court
if
she
pleased
.
<EOS>
While
this
was
going
on
,
Lord
Fawn
did
come
down
once
again
,
and
on
that
occasion
Lucy
simply
absented
herself
from
the
dinner
-
table
and
from
the
family
circle
for
that
evening
.
<EOS>
"
He
's
coming
in
,
and
you
've
got
to
go
to
prison
again
,
"
Nina
said
to
her
,
with
a
kiss
.
  
<EOS>
The
matter
to
which
Mrs.
Hittaway
's
letter
more
specially
alluded
was
debated
between
the
mother
and
daughter
at
great
length
.
<EOS>
They
,
indeed
,
were
less
brave
and
less
energetic
than
was
the
married
daughter
of
the
family
;
but
as
they
saw
Lord
Fawn
more
frequently
,
they
knew
better
than
Mrs.
Hittaway
the
real
state
of
the
case
.
<EOS>
They
felt
sure
that
he
was
already
sufficiently
embittered
against
Lady
Eustace
,
and
thought
that
therefore
the
peculiarly
unpleasant
task
assigned
to
Lady
Fawn
need
not
be
performed
.
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
had
not
the
advantage
of
living
so
much
in
the
world
as
her
daughter
,
and
was
oppressed
by
,
perhaps
,
a
squeamish
delicacy
.
<EOS>
"
I
really
could
not
tell
him
about
her
sitting
and
 
and
kissing
the
man
.
<EOS>
Could
I
,
my
dear
?
"
<EOS>
"
I
could
n't
,
"
said
Amelia
;
 
"
but
Clara
would
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
to
tell
the
truth
,
"
continued
Lady
Fawn
,
"
I
should
n't
care
a
bit
about
it
if
it
was
not
for
poor
Lucy
.
<EOS>
What
will
become
of
her
if
that
man
is
untrue
to
her
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nothing
on
earth
would
make
her
believe
it
,
unless
it
came
from
himself
,
"
said
Amelia
,
 
who
really
did
know
something
of
Lucy
's
character
.
<EOS>
"
Till
he
tells
her
,
or
till
she
knows
that
he
's
married
,
she
'll
never
believe
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Then
,
after
a
few
days
,
there
came
those
other
letters
from
Bobsborough
,
 
one
from
the
dean
's
wife
and
the
other
from
Frank
.
<EOS>
The
matter
there
proposed
it
was
necessary
that
they
should
discuss
with
Lucy
,
as
the
suggestion
had
reached
Lucy
as
well
as
themselves
.
<EOS>
She
at
once
came
to
Lady
Fawn
with
her
lover
's
letter
,
and
with
a
gentle
merry
<EOS>
laughing
face
declared
that
the
thing
would
do
very
well
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
I
should
get
on
with
her
,
and
I
should
know
that
it
would
n't
be
for
long
,
"
said
Lucy
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
truth
is
,
we
do
n't
want
you
to
go
at
all
,
"
said
Lady
Fawn
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
but
I
must
,
"
said
Lucy
in
her
sharp
,
decided
tone
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
go
.
<EOS>
I
was
bound
to
wait
till
I
heard
from
Mr.
Greystock
,
because
it
is
my
first
duty
to
obey
him
.
<EOS>
But
of
course
I
can
not
stay
here
after
what
has
passed
.
<EOS>
As
Nina
says
,
it
is
simply
going
to
prison
when
Lord
Fawn
comes
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nina
is
an
impertinent
little
chit
,
"
said
Amelia
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
is
the
dearest
little
friend
in
all
the
world
,
"
said
Lucy
,
"
and
always
tells
the
exact
truth
.
<EOS>
I
do
go
to
prison
,
and
when
he
comes
I
feel
that
I
ought
to
go
to
prison
.
<EOS>
Of
course
,
I
must
go
away
.
<EOS>
What
does
it
matter
?
<EOS>
Lady
Linlithgow
wo
n't
be
exactly
like
you
,
"
 
and
she
put
her
little
hand
upon
Lady
Fawn
's
fat
arm
caressingly
,
"
and
I
sha'n't
have
you
all
to
spoil
me
;
but
I
shall
be
simply
waiting
till
he
comes
.
<EOS>
Everything
now
must
be
no
more
than
waiting
till
he
comes
.
<EOS>
"
  
If
it
was
to
be
that
"
he
"
would
never
come
,
this
was
very
dreadful
.
<EOS>
Amelia
clearly
thought
that
"
he
"
would
never
come
,
and
Lady
Fawn
was
apt
to
think
her
daughter
wiser
than
herself
.
<EOS>
And
if
Mr.
Greystock
were
such
as
Mrs.
Hittaway
had
described
him
to
be
,
 
if
there
were
to
be
no
such
coming
as
that
for
which
Lucy
fondly
waited
,
 
then
there
would
be
reason
ten
-
fold
strong
why
she
should
not
leave
Fawn
Court
and
go
to
Lady
Linlithgow
.
<EOS>
In
such
case
,
 
when
that
blow
should
fall
,
 
Lucy
would
require
very
different
treatment
than
might
be
expected
for
her
from
the
hands
of
Lady
Linlithgow
.
<EOS>
She
would
fade
and
fall
to
the
earth
like
a
flower
with
an
insect
at
its
root
.
<EOS>
She
would
be
like
a
wounded
branch
,
into
which
no
sap
would
run
.
<EOS>
With
such
misfortune
and
wretchedness
possibly
before
her
,
Lady
Fawn
could
not
endure
the
idea
that
Lucy
should
be
turned
out
to
encounter
it
all
beneath
the
cold
shade
of
Lady
Linlithgow
's
indifference
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
,
"
she
said
,
"
let
bygones
be
bygones
.
<EOS>
Come
down
and
meet
Lord
Fawn
.
<EOS>
Nobody
will
say
anything
.
<EOS>
After
all
,
you
were
provoked
very
much
,
and
there
has
been
quite
enough
about
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
This
,
from
Lady
Fawn
,
was
almost
miraculous
,
 
from
Lady
Fawn
,
to
whom
her
son
had
ever
been
the
highest
of
human
beings
!
<EOS>
But
Lucy
had
told
the
tale
to
her
lover
,
and
her
lover
approved
of
her
going
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
there
was
acting
upon
her
mind
some
feeling
,
of
which
she
was
hardly
conscious
,
that
as
long
as
she
remained
at
Fawn
Court
she
would
not
see
her
lover
.
<EOS>
She
had
told
him
that
she
could
make
herself
supremely
happy
in
the
simple
knowledge
that
he
loved
her
.
<EOS>
But
we
all
know
how
far
such
declarations
should
be
taken
as
true
.
<EOS>
Of
course
,
she
was
longing
to
see
him
.
<EOS>
"
If
he
would
only
pass
by
the
road
,
"
she
would
say
to
herself
,
"
so
that
I
might
peep
at
him
through
the
gate
!

<EOS>
She
had
no
formed
idea
in
her
own
mind
that
she
would
be
able
to
see
him
<EOS>
should
she
go
to
Lady
Linlithgow
,
but
still
there
would
be
the
chances
of
her
altered
life
!
<EOS>
She
would
tell
Lady
Linlithgow
the
truth
,
and
why
should
Lady
Linlithgow
refuse
her
so
rational
a
pleasure
?
<EOS>
There
was
,
of
course
,
a
reason
why
Frank
should
not
come
to
Fawn
Court
;
but
the
house
in
Bruton
Street
need
not
be
closed
to
him
.
<EOS>
"
I
hardly
know
how
to
love
you
enough
,
"
she
said
to
Lady
Fawn
,
"
but
indeed
I
must
go
.
<EOS>
I
do
<EOS>
so
hope
the
time
may
come
when
you
and
Mr.
Greystock
may
be
friends
.
<EOS>
Of
course
,
it
will
come
.
<EOS>
Shall
it
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Who
can
look
into
the
future
?
"
said
the
wise
Amelia
.
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
,
if
he
is
your
husband
,
we
shall
love
him
,
"
said
the
less
wise
Lady
Fawn
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
to
be
my
husband
,
"
said
Lucy
,
springing
up
.
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
Do
you
mean
anything
?
"
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
,
who
was
not
at
all
wise
,
protested
that
she
meant
nothing
.
  
<EOS>
What
were
they
to
do
?
<EOS>
On
that
special
day
they
merely
stipulated
that
there
should
be
a
day
's
delay
before
Lady
Fawn
answered
Mrs.
Greystock
's
letter
,
 
so
that
she
might
sleep
upon
it
.
<EOS>
The
sleeping
on
it
meant
that
further
discussion
which
was
to
take
place
between
Lady
Fawn
and
her
second
daughter
in
her
ladyship
's
bed
-
room
that
night
.
<EOS>
During
all
this
period
the
general
discomfort
of
Fawn
Court
was
increased
by
a
certain
sullenness
on
the
part
of
Augusta
,
the
elder
daughter
,
who
knew
that
letters
had
come
and
that
consultations
were
being
held
,
 
but
who
was
not
admitted
to
those
consultations
.
<EOS>
Since
the
day
on
which
poor
Augusta
had
been
handed
over
to
Lizzie
Eustace
as
her
peculiar
friend
in
the
family
,
there
had
always
existed
a
feeling
that
she
,
by
her
position
,
was
debarred
from
sympathising
in
the
general
desire
to
be
quit
of
Lizzie
;
and
then
,
too
,
poor
Augusta
was
never
thoroughly
trusted
by
that
great
guide
of
the
family
,
Mrs.
Hittaway
.
<EOS>
"
She
could
n't
keep
it
to
herself
if
you
'd
give
her
gold
to
do
it
,
"
Mrs.
Hittaway
would
say
.
<EOS>
Consequently
Augusta
was
sullen
and
conscious
of
ill
-
usage
.
"
<EOS>
Have
you
fixed
upon
anything
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
said
to
Lucy
that
evening
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
quite
;
 
<EOS>
only
I
am
to
go
away
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
see
why
you
should
go
away
at
all
.
<EOS>
Frederic
does
n't
come
here
so
very
often
,
and
when
he
does
come
he
does
n't
say
much
to
any
one
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
it
's
all
Amelia
's
doing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nobody
wants
me
to
go
,
only
I
feel
that
I
ought
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Greystock
thinks
it
best
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
he
's
going
to
quarrel
with
us
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
dear
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
think
he
wants
to
quarrel
with
any
one
;
 
but
above
all
he
must
not
quarrel
with
me
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
has
quarrelled
with
him
,
and
that
's
a
misfortune
,
 
just
for
the
present
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
where
are
you
going
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nothing
has
been
settled
yet
;
but
we
are
talking
of
Lady
Linlithgow
,
 
if
she
will
take
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Lady
Linlithgow
!
<EOS>
Oh
dear
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Wo
n't
it
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
say
she
is
the
most
dreadful
old
woman
in
London
.
<EOS>
Lady
Eustace
told
such
stories
about
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
know
,
I
think
I
shall
rather
like
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
But
things
were
very
different
with
Lucy
the
next
morning
.
<EOS>
That
discussion
in
Lady
Fawn
's
room
was
protracted
till
midnight
,
and
then
it
was
decided
that
just
a
word
should
be
said
to
Lucy
,
so
that
,
if
possible
,
she
might
be
induced
to
remain
at
Fawn
Court
.
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
was
to
say
the
word
,
and
on
the
following
morning
she
was
closeted
with
Lucy
.
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
"
she
began
,
"
we
all
want
you
to
do
us
a
particular
favour
.
"
<EOS>
As
she
said
this
,
she
held
Lucy
by
the
hand
,
and
no
one
looking
at
them
would
have
thought
that
Lucy
was
a
governess
and
that
Lady
Fawn
was
her
employer
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
Lady
Fawn
,
indeed
it
is
better
that
I
should
go
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Stay
just
one
month
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
could
n't
do
that
,
because
then
this
chance
of
a
home
would
be
gone
.
<EOS>
Of
course
,
we
ca
n't
wait
a
month
before
we
let
Mrs.
Greystock
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
must
write
to
her
,
of
course
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
then
,
you
see
,
Mr.
Greystock
wishes
it
.
"
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
knew
that
Lucy
could
be
very
firm
,
and
had
hardly
hoped
that
anything
could
be
done
by
simple
persuasion
.
<EOS>
They
had
long
been
accustomed
among
themselves
to
call
her
obstinate
,
and
knew
that
even
in
her
acts
of
obedience
she
had
a
way
of
obeying
after
her
own
fashion
.
<EOS>
It
was
as
well
,
therefore
,
that
the
thing
to
be
said
should
be
said
at
once
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Lucy
,
has
it
ever
occurred
to
you
that
there
may
be
a
slip
between
the
cup
and
the
lip
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
,
Lady
Fawn
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
sometimes
engagements
take
place
which
never
become
more
than
engagements
.
<EOS>
Look
at
Lord
Fawn
and
Lady
Eustace
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Greystock
and
I
are
not
like
that
,
"
said
Lucy
,
proudly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Such
things
are
very
dreadful
,
Lucy
,
but
they
do
happen
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
mean
anything
;
 
anything
real
,
Lady
Fawn
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
so
strong
a
reliance
on
your
good
sense
,
that
I
will
tell
you
just
what
I
do
mean
.
<EOS>
A
rumour
has
reached
me
that
Mr.
Greystock
is
 
paying
more
attention
than
he
ought
to
do
to
Lady
Eustace
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
His
own
cousin
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
people
marry
their
cousins
,
Lucy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
To
whom
he
has
always
been
just
like
a
brother
!
<EOS>
I
do
think
that
is
the
cruellest
thing
.
<EOS>
Because
he
sacrifices
his
time
and
his
money
and
all
his
holidays
to
go
and
look
after
her
affairs
,
this
is
to
be
said
of
him
!
<EOS>
She
has
n't
another
human
being
to
look
after
her
,
and
,
therefore
,
he
is
obliged
to
do
it
.
<EOS>
Of
course
he
has
told
me
all
about
it
.
<EOS>
I
do
think
,
Lady
Fawn
,
 
<EOS>
I
do
think
that
is
the
greatest
shame
I
ever
heard
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
if
it
should
be
true
 
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
n't
true
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
But
just
for
the
sake
of
showing
you
,
Lucy
 
;
if
it
was
to
be
true
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
wo
n't
be
true
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Surely
I
may
speak
to
you
as
your
friend
,
Lucy
.
<EOS>
You
need
n't
be
so
abrupt
with
me
.
<EOS>
Will
you
listen
to
me
,
Lucy
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
I
will
listen
;
 
only
nothing
that
anybody
on
earth
could
say
about
that
would
make
me
believe
a
word
of
it
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
Very
well
!
<EOS>
Now
just
let
me
go
on
.
<EOS>
If
it
were
to
be
so
 
"
  
"
Oh
-
h
,
Lady
Fawn
!
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
n't
be
foolish
,
Lucy
.
<EOS>
I
will
say
what
I
've
got
to
say
.
<EOS>
If
 
if
  
Let
me
see
.
<EOS>
Where
was
I
?
<EOS>
I
mean
just
this
.
<EOS>
You
had
better
remain
here
till
things
are
a
little
more
settled
.
<EOS>
Even
if
it
be
only
a
rumour
,
 
<EOS>
and
I
'm
sure
I
do
n't
believe
it
's
anything
more
,
 
<EOS>
you
had
better
hear
about
it
with
us
,
 
with
friends
round
you
,
than
with
a
perfect
stranger
like
Lady
Linlithgow
.
<EOS>
If
anything
were
to
go
wrong
there
,
you
would
n't
know
where
to
go
for
comfort
.
<EOS>
If
anything
were
wrong
with
you
here
,
you
could
come
to
me
as
though
I
were
your
mother
.
 
<EOS>
Could
n't
you
,
now
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
,
indeed
I
could
!
<EOS>
And
I
will
;
 
I
always
will
.
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
,
I
love
you
and
the
dear
darling
girls
better
than
all
the
world
 
except
Mr.
Greystock
.
<EOS>
If
anything
like
that
were
to
happen
,
I
think
I
should
creep
here
and
ask
to
die
in
your
house
.
<EOS>
But
it
wo
n't
.
<EOS>
And
just
now
it
will
be
better
that
I
should
go
away
.
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
found
at
last
that
Lucy
must
have
her
way
,
and
letters
were
written
both
to
Mrs.
Greystock
and
to
Frank
,
requesting
that
the
suggested
overtures
might
at
once
be
made
to
Lady
Linlithgow
.
<EOS>
Lucy
,
in
her
letter
to
her
lover
,
was
more
than
ordinarily
cheerful
and
jocose
.
<EOS>
She
had
a
good
deal
to
say
about
Lady
Linlithgow
that
was
really
droll
,
and
not
a
word
to
say
indicative
of
the
slightest
fear
in
the
direction
of
Lady
Eustace
.
<EOS>
She
spoke
of
poor
Lizzie
,
and
declared
her
conviction
that
that
marriage
never
could
come
off
now
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
n't
be
angry
when
I
say
that
I
ca
n't
break
my
heart
for
them
,
<EOS>
for
I
never
did
think
that
they
were
very
much
in
love
.
<EOS>
As
for
Lord
Fawn
,
of
course
he
is
my
 
ENEMY
!
"
<EOS>
And
she
wrote
the
word
in
big
letters
.
"
<EOS>
And
as
for
Lizzie
,
 
she
's
your
cousin
,
and
all
that
.
<EOS>
And
she
's
ever
so
pretty
,
and
all
that
.
<EOS>
And
she
's
as
rich
as
Croesus
,
and
all
that
.
<EOS>
But
I
do
n't
think
she
'll
break
her
own
heart
.
<EOS>
I
would
break
mine
;
only
 
only
 
only
 
You
will
understand
the
rest
.
<EOS>
If
it
should
come
to
pass
,
I
wonder
whether
"
the
duchess
"
would
ever
let
a
poor
creature
see
a
friend
of
hers
in
Bruton
Street
?
"
<EOS>
Frank
had
once
called
Lady
Linlithgow
the
duchess
,
after
a
certain
popular
picture
in
a
certain
popular
book
,
and
Lucy
never
forgot
anything
that
Frank
had
said
.
  
<EOS>
It
did
come
to
pass
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Greystock
at
once
corresponded
with
Lady
Linlithgow
,
and
Lady
Linlithgow
,
who
was
at
Ramsgate
for
her
autumn
vacation
,
requested
that
Lucy
Morris
might
be
brought
to
see
her
at
her
house
in
London
on
the
2nd
of
October
.
<EOS>
Lady
Linlithgow
's
autumn
holiday
always
ended
on
the
last
day
of
September
.
<EOS>
On
the
2nd
of
October
Lady
Fawn
herself
took
Lucy
up
to
Bruton
Street
,
and
Lady
Linlithgow
appeared
.
"
<EOS>
Miss
Morris
,
"
said
Lady
Fawn
,
"
thinks
it
right
that
you
should
be
told
that
she
's
engaged
to
be
married
.
"
<EOS>
"
Who
to
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
the
countess
.
<EOS>
Lucy
was
as
red
as
fire
,
although
she
had
especially
made
up
her
mind
that
she
would
not
blush
when
the
communication
was
made
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
that
she
wishes
me
to
mention
the
gentleman
's
name
,
just
at
present
;
but
I
can
assure
you
that
he
is
all
that
he
ought
to
be
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
hate
mysteries
,
"
said
the
countess
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
If
Lady
Linlithgow
 
"
began
Lucy
.
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
it
's
nothing
to
me
,
"
continued
the
old
woman
.
<EOS>
"
It
wo
n't
come
off
for
six
months
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
Lucy
gave
a
mute
assurance
that
there
would
be
no
such
difficulty
as
that
.
"
<EOS>
And
he
ca
n't
come
here
,
Miss
Morris
.
<EOS>
"
To
this
Lucy
said
nothing
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
she
might
win
over
even
the
countess
,
and
if
not
,
she
must
bear
her
six
months
of
prolonged
exclusion
from
the
light
of
day
.
<EOS>
And
so
the
matter
was
settled
.
<EOS>
Lucy
was
to
be
taken
back
to
Richmond
,
and
to
come
again
on
the
following
Monday
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
like
this
parting
at
all
,
Lucy
,
"
Lady
Fawn
said
on
her
way
home
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
better
so
,
Lady
Fawn
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hate
people
going
away
;
but
,
somehow
,
you
do
n't
feel
it
as
we
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
would
n't
say
that
if
you
really
knew
what
I
do
feel
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
was
no
reason
why
you
should
go
.
<EOS>
Frederic
was
getting
not
to
care
for
it
at
all
.
<EOS>
What
's
Nina
to
do
now
?
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
get
another
governess
after
you
.
<EOS>
I
hate
all
these
sudden
breaks
up
.
<EOS>
And
all
for
such
a
trumpery
thing
.
<EOS>
If
Frederic
has
n't
forgotten
all
about
it
,
he
ought
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
has
n't
come
altogether
from
him
,
Lady
Fawn
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
has
it
come
,
then
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
it
is
because
of
Mr.
Greystock
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
when
a
girl
has
engaged
herself
to
marry
a
man
she
must
think
more
of
him
than
of
anything
else
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
could
n't
you
think
of
him
at
Fawn
Court
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Because
 
because
things
have
been
unfortunate
.
<EOS>
He
is
n't
your
friend
,
 
not
as
yet
.
<EOS>
Ca
n't
you
understand
,
Lady
Fawn
,
that
,
dear
as
you
all
must
be
to
me
,
I
must
live
in
his
friendships
,
and
take
his
part
when
there
is
a
part
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
I
suppose
that
you
mean
to
hate
all
of
us
?
"
<EOS>
Lucy
could
only
cry
at
hearing
this
;
 
whereupon
Lady
Fawn
also
burst
into
tears
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
Sunday
before
Lucy
took
her
departure
,
Lord
Fawn
was
again
at
Richmond
.
<EOS>
"
Of
course
,
you
'll
come
down
,
 
just
as
if
nothing
had
happened
,
"
said
Lydia
.
<EOS>
"
We
'll
see
,
"
said
Lucy
.
<EOS>
"
Mamma
will
be
very
angry
if
you
do
n't
,
"
said
Lydia
.
  
<EOS>
But
Lucy
had
a
little
plot
in
her
head
,
and
her
appearance
at
the
dinner
-
table
on
that
Sunday
must
depend
on
the
manner
in
which
her
plot
was
executed
.
<EOS>
After
church
,
Lord
Fawn
would
always
hang
about
the
grounds
for
awhile
before
going
into
the
house
;
and
on
this
morning
Lucy
also
remained
outside
.
<EOS>
She
soon
found
her
opportunity
,
and
walked
straight
up
to
him
,
following
him
on
the
path
.
"
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
,
"
she
said
,
"
I
have
come
to
beg
your
pardon
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
had
turned
round
hearing
footsteps
behind
him
,
but
still
was
startled
and
unready
.
<EOS>
"
It
does
not
matter
at
all
,
"
he
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
matters
to
me
,
because
I
behaved
badly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
I
said
about
Mr.
Greystock
was
n't
intended
to
be
said
to
you
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Even
if
it
was
it
would
make
no
matter
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
mean
to
think
of
that
now
.
<EOS>
I
beg
your
pardon
because
I
said
what
I
ought
not
to
have
said
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
You
see
,
Miss
Morris
,
that
as
the
head
of
this
family
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
If
I
had
said
it
to
Juniper
,
I
would
have
begged
his
pardon
.
"
<EOS>
Now
Juniper
was
the
gardener
,
and
Lord
Fawn
did
not
quite
like
the
way
in
which
the
thing
was
put
to
him
.
<EOS>
The
cloud
came
across
his
brow
,
and
he
began
to
fear
that
she
would
again
insult
him
.
<EOS>
"
I
ought
n't
to
accuse
anybody
of
an
untruth
,
 
not
in
that
way
;
and
I
am
very
sorry
for
what
I
did
,
and
I
beg
your
pardon
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Then
she
turned
as
though
she
were
going
back
to
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
But
he
stopped
her
.
"
<EOS>
Miss
Morris
,
if
it
will
suit
you
to
stay
with
my
mother
,
I
will
never
say
a
word
against
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
quite
settled
that
I
am
to
go
to
-
morrow
,
Lord
Fawn
.
<EOS>
Only
for
that
I
would
not
have
troubled
you
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Then
she
did
turn
towards
the
house
,
but
he
recalled
her
.
<EOS>
"
We
will
shake
hands
,
at
any
rate
,
"
he
said
,
"
and
not
part
as
enemies
.
"
<EOS>
So
they
shook
hands
,
and
Lucy
came
down
and
sat
in
his
company
at
the
dinner
-
table
.
   
<EOS>
Lady
Linlithgow
at
Home
 
Lucy
,
in
her
letter
to
her
lover
,
had
distinctly
asked
whether
she
might
tell
Lady
Linlithgow
the
name
of
her
future
husband
,
but
had
received
no
reply
when
she
was
taken
to
Bruton
Street
.
<EOS>
The
parting
at
Richmond
was
very
painful
,
and
Lady
Fawn
had
declared
herself
quite
unable
to
make
another
journey
up
to
London
with
the
ungrateful
runagate
.
<EOS>
Though
there
was
no
diminution
of
affection
among
the
Fawns
,
there
was
a
general
feeling
that
Lucy
was
behaving
badly
.
<EOS>
That
obstinacy
of
hers
was
getting
the
better
of
her
.
<EOS>
Why
should
she
have
gone
?
<EOS>
Even
Lord
Fawn
had
expressed
his
desire
that
she
should
remain
.
<EOS>
And
then
,
in
the
breasts
of
the
wise
ones
,
all
faith
in
the
Greystock
engagement
had
nearly
vanished
.
<EOS>
Another
letter
had
come
from
Mrs.
Hittaway
,
who
now
declared
that
it
was
already
understood
about
Portray
that
Lady
Eustace
intended
to
marry
her
cousin
.
<EOS>
This
was
described
as
a
terrible
crime
on
the
part
of
Lizzie
,
though
the
antagonistic
crime
of
a
remaining
desire
to
marry
Lord
Fawn
was
still
imputed
to
her
.
<EOS>
And
,
of
course
,
the
one
crime
heightened
the
other
.
<EOS>
So
that
words
from
the
eloquent
pen
of
Mrs.
Hittaway
failed
to
make
dark
enough
the
blackness
of
poor
Lizzie
's
character
.
<EOS>
As
for
Mr.
Greystock
,
he
was
simply
a
heartless
man
of
the
world
,
wishing
to
feather
his
nest
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Hittaway
did
not
for
a
moment
believe
that
he
had
ever
dreamed
of
marrying
Lucy
Morris
.
<EOS>
Men
always
have
three
or
four
little
excitements
of
that
kind
going
on
for
the
amusement
of
their
leisure
hours
,
 
so
,
at
least
,
said
Mrs.
Hittaway
.
<EOS>
"
The
girl
had
better
be
told
at
once
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Such
was
her
decision
about
poor
Lucy
.
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
do
more
than
I
have
done
,
"
said
Lady
Fawn
to
Augusta
.
<EOS>
"
She
'll
never
get
over
it
,
mamma
;
never
,
"
said
Augusta
.
  
<EOS>
Nothing
more
was
said
,
and
Lucy
was
sent
off
in
the
family
carriage
.
<EOS>
Lydia
and
Nina
were
sent
with
her
,
and
though
there
was
some
weeping
on
the
journey
,
there
was
also
much
laughing
.
<EOS>
The
character
of
the
"
duchess
"
was
discussed
very
much
at
large
,
and
many
promises
were
made
as
to
long
letters
.
<EOS>
Lucy
,
in
truth
,
was
not
unhappy
.
<EOS>
She
would
be
nearer
to
Frank
;
and
then
it
had
been
almost
promised
her
that
she
should
go
to
the
deanery
,
after
a
residence
of
six
months
with
Lady
Linlithgow
.
<EOS>
At
the
deanery
of
course
she
would
see
Frank
;
and
she
also
understood
that
a
long
visit
to
the
deanery
would
be
the
surest
prelude
to
that
home
of
her
own
of
which
she
was
always
dreaming
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
;
 
sent
you
up
in
the
carriage
,
has
she
?
<EOS>
Why
should
n't
you
have
come
by
the
railway
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Lady
Fawn
thought
the
carriage
best
.
<EOS>
She
is
so
very
kind
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
what
I
call
twaddle
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
I
hope
you
ai
n't
afraid
of
going
in
a
cab
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
in
the
least
,
Lady
Linlithgow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
ca
n't
have
the
carriage
to
go
about
here
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
I
never
have
a
pair
of
horses
till
after
Christmas
.
<EOS>
I
hope
you
know
that
I
'm
as
poor
as
Job
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
,
then
.
<EOS>
You
'll
get
nothing
beyond
wholesome
food
with
me
.
<EOS>
And
I
'm
not
sure
it
is
wholesome
always
.
<EOS>
The
butchers
are
scoundrels
,
and
the
bakers
are
worse
.
<EOS>
What
used
you
to
do
at
Lady
Fawn
's
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
still
did
lessons
with
the
two
youngest
girls
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
wo
n't
have
any
lessons
to
do
here
,
unless
you
do
"
em
with
me
.
<EOS>
You
had
a
salary
there
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
yes
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Fifty
pounds
a
year
,
I
suppose
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
had
eighty
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Had
you
,
indeed
;
eighty
pounds
;
 
and
a
coach
to
ride
in
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
had
a
great
deal
more
than
that
,
Lady
Linlithgow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
had
downright
love
and
affection
.
<EOS>
They
were
just
so
many
dear
friends
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
suppose
any
governess
was
ever
so
treated
before
.
<EOS>
It
was
just
like
being
at
home
.
<EOS>
The
more
I
laughed
,
the
better
every
one
liked
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
wo
n't
find
anything
to
laugh
at
here
;
at
least
,
I
do
n't
.
<EOS>
If
you
want
to
laugh
,
you
can
laugh
up
-
stairs
,
or
down
in
the
parlour
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
do
without
laughing
for
a
while
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
lucky
,
Miss
Morris
.
<EOS>
If
they
were
all
so
good
to
you
,
what
made
you
come
away
?
<EOS>
They
sent
you
away
,
did
n't
they
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
;
 
I
do
n't
know
that
I
can
explain
it
just
all
.
<EOS>
There
were
a
great
many
things
together
.
<EOS>
No
;
 
they
did
n't
send
me
away
.
<EOS>
I
came
away
because
it
suited
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
something
to
do
with
your
having
a
lover
,
I
suppose
.
<EOS>
"
To
this
Lucy
thought
it
best
to
make
no
answer
,
and
the
conversation
for
a
while
was
dropped
.
  
<EOS>
Lucy
had
arrived
at
about
half
-
past
three
,
and
Lady
Linlithgow
was
then
sitting
in
the
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
After
the
first
series
of
questions
and
answers
,
Lucy
was
allowed
to
go
up
to
her
room
,
and
on
her
return
to
the
drawing
-
room
,
found
the
countess
still
sitting
upright
in
her
chair
.
<EOS>
She
was
now
busy
with
accounts
,
and
at
first
took
no
notice
of
Lucy
's
return
.
<EOS>
What
were
to
be
the
companion
's
duties
?
<EOS>
What
tasks
in
the
house
were
to
be
assigned
to
her
?
<EOS>
What
hours
were
to
be
her
own
;
and
what
was
to
be
done
in
those
of
which
the
countess
would
demand
the
use
?
<EOS>
Up
to
the
present
moment
nothing
had
been
said
of
all
this
.
<EOS>
She
had
simply
been
told
that
she
was
to
be
Lady
Linlithgow
's
companion
,
 
without
salary
,
indeed
,
 
but
receiving
shelter
,
guardianship
,
and
bread
and
meat
in
return
for
her
services
.
<EOS>
She
took
up
a
book
from
the
table
and
sat
with
it
for
ten
minutes
.
<EOS>
It
was
Tupper
's
great
poem
,
and
she
attempted
to
read
it
.
<EOS>
Lady
Linlithgow
sat
,
totting
up
her
figures
,
but
said
nothing
.
<EOS>
She
had
not
spoken
a
word
since
Lucy
's
return
to
the
room
;
and
as
the
great
poem
did
not
at
first
fascinate
the
new
companion
,
 
whose
mind
not
unnaturally
was
somewhat
disturbed
<EOS>
,
 
Lucy
ventured
upon
a
question
.
"
<EOS>
Is
there
anything
I
can
do
for
you
,
Lady
Linlithgow
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
know
about
figures
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
yes
.
<EOS>
I
consider
myself
quite
a
ready
-
reckoner
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Can
you
make
two
and
two
come
to
five
on
one
side
of
the
sheet
,
and
only
come
to
three
on
the
other
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
afraid
I
ca
n't
do
that
,
and
prove
it
afterwards
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
you
ai
n't
worth
anything
to
me
.
"
<EOS>
Having
so
declared
,
Lady
Linlithgow
went
on
with
her
accounts
and
Lucy
relapsed
into
her
great
poem
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
my
dear
,
"
said
the
countess
,
when
she
had
completed
her
work
.
<EOS>
"
There
is
n't
anything
for
you
to
do
.
<EOS>
I
hope
you
have
n't
come
here
with
that
mistaken
idea
.
<EOS>
There
wo
n't
be
any
sort
of
work
of
any
kind
expected
from
you
.
<EOS>
I
poke
my
own
fires
,
and
I
carve
my
own
bit
of
mutton
.
<EOS>
And
I
have
n't
got
a
nasty
little
dog
to
be
washed
.
<EOS>
And
I
do
n't
care
twopence
about
worsted
work
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
maid
to
darn
my
stockings
,
and
because
she
has
to
work
,
I
pay
her
wages
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
like
being
alone
,
so
I
get
you
to
come
and
live
with
me
.
<EOS>
I
breakfast
at
nine
,
and
if
you
do
n't
manage
to
be
down
by
that
time
,
I
shall
be
cross
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
always
up
long
before
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
lunch
at
two
,
 
just
bread
and
butter
and
cheese
,
and
perhaps
a
bit
of
cold
meat
.
<EOS>
There
's
dinner
at
seven
;
 
and
very
bad
it
is
,
because
they
do
n't
have
any
good
meat
in
London
.
<EOS>
Down
in
Fifeshire
the
meat
's
a
deal
better
than
it
is
here
,
only
I
never
go
there
now
.
<EOS>
At
half
-
past
ten
I
go
to
bed
.
<EOS>
It
's
a
pity
<EOS>
you
're
so
young
,
because
I
do
n't
know
what
you
'll
do
about
going
out
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
,
as
you
ai
n't
pretty
,
it
wo
n't
signify
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Not
at
all
,
I
should
think
,
"
said
Lucy
.
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
you
consider
yourself
pretty
.
<EOS>
It
's
all
altered
now
since
I
was
young
.
<EOS>
Girls
make
monsters
of
themselves
,
and
I
'm
told
the
men
like
it
;
 
going
about
with
unclean
,
frowsy
structures
on
their
heads
,
enough
to

a
dog
sick

<EOS>
They
used
to
be
clean
and
sweet
and
nice
,
 
what
one
would
like
to
kiss
.
<EOS>
How
a
man
can
like
to
kiss
a
face
with
a
dirty
horse
's
tail
all
whizzing
about
it
,
is
what
I
ca
n't
at
all
understand
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
think
they
do
like
it
,
but
they
have
to
do
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
n't
even
a
pony
's
tail
,
"
said
Lucy
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
do
like
to
kiss
you
,
I
daresay
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
they
do
n't
,
"
ejaculated
Lucy
,
not
knowing
what
answer
to
make
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
n't
hardly
looked
at
you
,
but
you
did
n't
seem
to
me
to
be
a
beauty

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
're
quite
right
about
that
,
Lady
Linlithgow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hate
beauties
.
<EOS>
My
niece
,
Lizzie
Eustace
,
is
a
beauty
;
and
I
think
that
,
of
all
the
heartless
creatures
in
the
world
,
she
is
the
most
heartless
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
Lady
Eustace
very
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
you
do
.
<EOS>
She
was
a
Greystock
,
and
you
know
the
Greystocks
.
<EOS>
And
she
was
down
staying
with
old
Lady
Fawn
at
Richmond
.
<EOS>
I
should
think
old
Lady
Fawn
had
a
time
with
her
;
 
had
n't
she
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
did
n't
go
off
very
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Lizzie
would
be
too
much
for
the
Fawns
,
I
should
think
.
<EOS>
She
was
too
much
for
me
,
I
know
.
<EOS>
She
's
about
as
bad
as
anybody
ever
was
.
<EOS>
She
's
false
,
dishonest
,
heartless
,
cruel
,
irreligious
,
ungrateful
,
mean
,
ignorant
,
greedy
,
and
vile
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Good
gracious
,
Lady
Linlithgow
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
's
all
that
,
and
a
great
deal
worse
.
<EOS>
But
she
is
handsome
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
that
I
ever
saw
a
prettier
woman
.
<EOS>
I
generally
go
out
in
a
cab
at
three
o'clock
,
but
I
sha'n't
want
you
to
go
with
me
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
what
you
can
do
.
<EOS>
Macnulty
used
to
walk
round
Grosvenor
Square
and
think
that
people
mistook
her
for
a
lady
of
quality
.
<EOS>
You
must
n't
go
and
walk
round
Grosvenor
Square
by
yourself
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
Not
that
I
care
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
not
a
bit
afraid
of
anybody
,
"
said
Lucy
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
you
know
all
about
it
.
<EOS>
There
is
n't
anything
for
you
to
do
.
<EOS>
There
are
Miss
Edgeworth
's
novels
down
-
stairs
,
and
"
Pride
and
Prejudice
"
in
my
bed
-
room
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
subscribe
to
Mudie
's
,
because
when
I
asked
for
"
Adam
Bede
,
"
they
always
sent
me
the
"
Bandit
Chief
.
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
you
can
borrow
books
from
your
friends
at
Richmond
.
<EOS>
I
daresay
Mrs.
Greystock
has
told
you
that
I
'm
very
cross
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
n't
seen
Mrs.
Greystock
for
ever
so
long
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
Lady
Fawn
has
told
you
,
 
or
somebody
.
<EOS>
When
the
wind
is
east
,
or
north
-
east
,
or
even
north
,
I
am
cross
,
for
I
have
the
lumbago
.
<EOS>
It
's
all
very
well
talking
about
being
good
-
humoured
.
<EOS>
You
ca
n't
be
good
-
humoured
with
the
lumbago
.
<EOS>
And
I
have
the
gout
sometimes
in
my
knee
.
<EOS>
I
'm
cross
enough
then
,
and
so
you
'd
be
.
<EOS>
And
,
among
"
em
all
,
I
do
n't
get
much
above
half
what
I
ought
to
have
out
of
my
jointure
.
<EOS>
That
makes
me
very
cross
.
<EOS>
My
teeth
are
bad
,
and
I
like
to
have
the
meat
tender
.
<EOS>
But
it
's
always
tough
,
and
that
makes
me
cross
.
<EOS>
And
when
people
go
against
the
grain
with
me
,
as
Lizzie
Eustace
always
did
,
then
I
'm
very
cross
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
wo
n't
be
very
bad
with
me
,
"
said
Lucy
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
bite
,
if
you
mean
that
,
"
said
her
ladyship
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'd
sooner
be
bitten
than
barked
at
,
 
sometimes
,
"
said
Lucy
.
  
<EOS>
"
Humph
!
"
said
the
old
woman
,
and
then
she
went
back
to
her
accounts
.
  
<EOS>
Lucy
had
a
few
books
of
her
own
,
and
she
determined
to
ask
Frank
to
send
her
some
.
<EOS>
Books
are
cheap
things
,
and
she
would
not
mind
asking
him
for
magazines
,
and
numbers
,
and
perhaps
for
the
loan
of
a
few
volumes
.
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
she
did
read
Tupper
's
poem
,
and
"
Pride
and
Prejudice
,
"
and
one
of
Miss
Edgeworth
's
novels
,
 
probably
for
the
third
time
.
<EOS>
During
the
first
week
in
Bruton
Street
she
would
have
been
comfortable
enough
,
only
that
she
had
not
received
a
line
from
Frank
.
<EOS>
That
Frank
was
not
specially
good
at
writing
letters
she
had
already
taught
herself
to
understand
.
<EOS>
She
was
inclined
to
believe
that
but
few
men
of
business
do
write
letters
willingly
,
and
that
,
of
all
men
,
lawyers
are
the
least
willing
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
How
reasonable
it
was
that
a
man
who
had
to
perform
a
great
part
of
his
daily
work
with
a
pen
in
his
hand
,
should
loathe
a
pen
when
not
at
work
.
<EOS>
To
her
the
writing
of
letters
was
perhaps
the
most
delightful
occupation
of
her
life
,
and
the
writing
of
letters
to
her
lover
was
a
foretaste
of
heaven
;
but
then
men
,
as
she
knew
,
are
very
different
from
women
.
<EOS>
And
she
knew
this
also
,
 
that
of
all
her
immediate
duties
,
no
duty
could
be
clearer
than
that
of
abstaining
from
all
jealousy
,
petulance
,
and
impatient
expectation
of
little
attentions
.
<EOS>
He
loved
her
,
and
had
told
her
so
,
and
had
promised
her
that
she
should
be
his
wife
,
and
that
ought
to
be
enough
for
her
.
<EOS>
She
was
longing
for
a
letter
,
because
she
was
very
anxious
to
know
whether
she
might
mention
his
name
to
Lady
Linlithgow
;
 
but
she
would
abstain
from
any
idea
of
blaming
him
because
the
letter
did
not
come
.
  
<EOS>
On
various
occasions
the
countess
showed
some
little
curiosity
about
the
lover
;
and
at
last
,
after
about
ten
days
,
when
she
found
herself
beginning
to
be
intimate
with
her
new
companion
,
she
put
the
question
point
-
blank
.
<EOS>
"
I
hate
mysteries
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
Who
is
the
young
man
you
are
to
marry
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
a
gentleman
I
've
known
a
long
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
no
answer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
want
to
tell
his
name
quite
yet
,
Lady
Linlithgow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
should
n't
you
tell
his
name
,
unless
it
's
something
improper
?
<EOS>
Is
he
a
gentleman
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
 
he
is
a
gentleman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
how
old
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
do
n't
know
;
 
perhaps
thirty
-
two
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
has
he
any
money
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
has
his
profession
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
like
these
kind
of
secrets
,
Miss
Morris
.
<EOS>
If
you
wo
n't
say
who
he
is
,
what
was
the
good
of
telling
me
that
you
were
engaged
at
all
?
<EOS>
How
is
a
person
to
believe
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
want
you
to
believe
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Highty
,
tighty
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
told
you
my
own
part
of
the
affair
,
because
I
thought
you
ought
to
know
it
as
I
was
coming
into
your
house
.
<EOS>
But
I
do
n't
see
that
you
ought
to
know
his
part
of
it
.
<EOS>
As
for
not
believing
,
I
suppose
you
believed
Lady
Fawn
?
"
  
"
Not
a
bit
better
than
I
believe
you
.
<EOS>
People
do
n't
always
tell
truth
because
they
have
titles
,
nor
yet
because
they
've
grown
old
.
<EOS>
He
do
n't
live
in
London
;
 
does
he
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
generally
lives
in
London
.
<EOS>
He
is
a
barrister
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
 
oh
;
a
barrister
is
he
.
<EOS>
They
're
always
making
a
heap
of
money
,
or
else
none
at
all
.
<EOS>
Which
is
it
with
him
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
makes
something
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
As
much
as
you
could
put
in
your
eye
and
see
none
the
worse
.
<EOS>
"
To
see
the
old
lady
,
as
she
made
this
suggestion
,
turn
sharp
round
upon
Lucy
,
was
as
good
as
a
play
.
<EOS>
"
My
sister
's
nephew
,
the
dean
's
son
,
is
one
of
the
best
of
the
rising
ones
,
I
'm
told
.
"
<EOS>
Lucy
blushed
up
to
her
hair
,
but
the
dowager
's
back
was
turned
,
and
she
did
not
see
the
blushes
.
<EOS>
"
But
he
's
in
Parliament
,
and
they
tell
me
he
spends
his
money
faster
than
he
makes
it
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
you
know
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
 
I
knew
him
at
Bobsborough
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
my
belief
that
after
all
this
fuss
about
Lord
Fawn
,
he
'll
marry
his
cousin
,
Lizzie
Eustace
.
<EOS>
If
he
's
a
lawyer
,
and
as
sharp
as
they
say
,
I
suppose
he
could
manage
her
.
<EOS>
I
wish
he
would
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
she
so
bad
as
you
say
she
is
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
'll
be
sure
to
get
somebody
,
and
why
should
n't
he
have
her
money
as
well
as
another
?
<EOS>
There
never
was
a
Greystock
who
did
n't
want
money
.
<EOS>
That
's
what
it
will
come
to
;
 
you
'll
see
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Never
,
"
said
Lucy
decidedly
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
why
not
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
I
mean
is
that
Mr.
Greystock
is
,
 
at
least
,
I
should
think
so
from
what
I
hear
,
 
the
very
last
man
in
the
world
to
marry
for
money
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
know
of
what
a
man
would
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
a
very
mean
thing
;
 
particularly
if
he
does
not
love
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Bother
!
"
said
the
countess
.
<EOS>
"
They
were
very
near
it
in
town
last
year
before
Lord
Fawn
came
up
at
all
.
<EOS>
I
knew
as
much
as
that
.
<EOS>
And
it
's
what
they
'll
come
to
before
they
've
done
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
'll
never
come
to
it
,
"
said
Lucy
.
  
<EOS>
Then
a
sudden
light
flashed
across
the
astute
mind
of
the
countess
.
<EOS>
She
turned
round
in
her
chair
,
and
sat
for
awhile
silent
,
looking
at
Lucy
.
<EOS>
Then
she
slowly
asked
another
question
.
"
<EOS>
He
is
n't
your
young
man
;
 
is
he
?
"
<EOS>
To
this
Lucy
made
no
reply
.
"
<EOS>
So
that
's
it
,
is
it
?
"
said
the
dowager
.
<EOS>
"
You
've
done
me
the
honour
of
making
my
house
your
home
till
my
own
sister
's
nephew
shall
be
ready
to
marry
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
why
not
?
"
said
Lucy
,
rather
roughly
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
dame
Greystock
,
from
Bobsborough
,
has
sent
you
here
to
keep
you
out
of
her
son
's
way
.
<EOS>
I
see
it
all
.
<EOS>
And
that
old
frump
at
Richmond
has
passed
you
over
to
me
because
she
did
not
choose
to
have
such
goings
on
under
her
own
eye
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
have
been
no
goings
on
,
"
said
Lucy
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
he
's
to
come
here
,
I
suppose
,
when
my
back
's
turned
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
not
thinking
of
coming
here
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
what
you
mean
.
<EOS>
Nobody
has
done
anything
wrong
to
you
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
why
you
say
such
cruel
things

<EOS>
"
He
ca
n't
afford
to
marry
you
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
anything
about
it
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
we
must
wait
ever
so
long
;
 
five
years
.
<EOS>
That
's
nobody
's
business
but
my
own
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
found
it
all
out
;
 
did
n't
I
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
 
you
found
it
out
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
thinking
of
that
sly
old
dame
Greystock
at
Bobsborough
,
 
sending
you
here
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Neither
on
that
nor
on
the
two
following
days
did
Lady
Linlithgow
say
a
word
further
to
Lucy
about
her
engagement
.
   
<EOS>
Too
Bad
for
Sympathy
 
<EOS>
When
Frank
Greystock
left
Bobsborough
to
go
to
Scotland
,
he
had
not
said
that
he
would
return
,
nor
had
he
at
that
time
made
up
his
mind
whether
he
would
do
so
or
no
.
<EOS>
He
had
promised
to
go
and
shoot
in
Norfolk
,
and
had
half
undertaken
to
be
up
in
London
with
Herriot
,
working
.
<EOS>
Though
it
was
holiday
-
time
,
still
there
was
plenty
of
work
for
him
to
do
,
 
various
heavy
cases
to
get
up
,
and
papers
to
be
read
,
if
only
he
could
settle
himself
down
to
the
doing
of
it
.
<EOS>
But
the
scenes
down
in
Scotland
had
been
of
a
nature
to
make
him
unfit
for
steady
labour
.
<EOS>
How
was
he
to
sail
his
bark
through
the
rocks
by
which
his
present
voyage
was
rendered
so
dangerous
?
<EOS>
Of
course
,
to
the
reader
,
the
way
to
do
so
seems
to
be
clear
enough
.
<EOS>
To
work
hard
at
his
profession
;
to
explain
to
his
cousin
that
she
had
altogether
mistaken
his
feelings
;
and
to
be
true
to
Lucy
Morris
<EOS>
was
so
manifestly
his
duty
<EOS>
,
that
to
no
reader
will
it
appear
possible
that
to
any
gentleman
there
could
be
a
doubt
.
<EOS>
Instead
of
the
existence
of
a
difficulty
,
there
was
a
flood
of
light
upon
his
path
,
 
<EOS>
so
the
reader
will
think
;
 
<EOS>
a
flood
so
clear
that
not
to
see
<EOS>
his
way
was
impossible
.
<EOS>
A
man
carried
away
by
abnormal
appetites
,
and
wickedness
,
and
the
devil
,
may
of
course
commit
murder
,
or
forge
bills
,
or
become
a
fraudulent
director
of
a
bankrupt
company
.
<EOS>
And
so
may
a
man
be
untrue
to
his
troth
,
 
and
leave
true
love
in
pursuit
of
tinsel
,
and
beauty
,
and
false
words
,
and
a
large
income
.
<EOS>
But
why
should
one
tell
the
story
of
creatures
<EOS>
so
base
?
<EOS>
One
does
not
willingly
grovel
in
gutters
,
or
breathe
fetid
atmospheres
,
or
live
upon
garbage
.
<EOS>
If
we
are
to
deal
with
heroes
and
heroines
,
let
us
,
at
any
rate
,
have
heroes
and
heroines
who
are
above
such
meanness
as
falsehood
in
love
.
<EOS>
This
Frank
Greystock
must
be
little
better
than
a
mean
villain
,
if
he
allows
himself
to
be
turned
from
his
allegiance
to
Lucy
Morris
for
an
hour
by
the
seductions
and
money
of
such
a
one
as
Lizzie
Eustace
.
  
<EOS>
We
know
the
dear
old
rhyme
:
    
<EOS>
"
It
is
good
to
be
merry
and
wise
,
It
is
good
to
be
honest
and
true
,
It
is
good
to
be
off
with
the
old
love
Before
you
are
on
with
the
new
.
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
never
better
truth
spoken
than
this
,
and
if
all
men
and
women
could
follow
the
advice
here
given
,
there
would
be
very
little
sorrow
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
But
men
and
women
do
not
follow
it
.
<EOS>
They
are
no
more
able
to
do
so
than
they
are
to
use
a
spear
,
the
staff
of
which
is
like
a
weaver
's
beam
,
or
to
fight
with
the
sword
Excalibur
.
<EOS>
The
more
they
exercise
their
arms
,
the
nearer
will
they
get
to
using
the
giant
's
weapon
,
 
or
even
the
weapon
that
is
divine
.
<EOS>
But
as
things
are
at
present
,
their
limbs
are
limp
and
their
muscles
soft
,
and
over
-
feeding
impedes
their
breath
.
<EOS>
They
attempt
to
be
merry
without
being
wise
,
and
have
theories
about
truth
and
honesty
with
which
they
desire
to
shackle
others
,
thinking
that
freedom
from
such
trammels
may
be
good
for
themselves
.
<EOS>
And
in
that
matter
of
love
,
 
though
love
is
very
potent
,
 
treachery
will
sometimes
seem
to
be
prudence
,
and
a
hankering
after
new
delights
will
often
interfere
with
real
devotion
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
very
easy
to
depict
a
hero
,
 
a
man
absolutely
stainless
,
perfect
as
an
Arthur
,
 
a
man
honest
in
all
his
dealings
,
equal
to
all
trials
,
true
in
all
his
speech
,
indifferent
to
his
own
prosperity
,
struggling
for
the
general
good
,
and
,
above
all
,
faithful
in
love
.
<EOS>
At
any
rate
,
it
is
as
easy
to
do
that
as
to
tell
of
the
man
who
is
one
hour
good
and
the
next
bad
,
who
aspires
greatly
but
fails
in
practice
,
who
sees
the
higher
but
too
often
follows
the
lower
course
.
<EOS>
There
arose
at
one
time
a
school
of
art
,
which
delighted
to
paint
the
human
face
as
perfect
in
beauty
;
and
from
that
time
to
this
we
are
discontented
unless
every
woman
is
drawn
for
us
as
a
Venus
,
or
,
at
least
,
a
Madonna
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
that
we
have
gained
much
by
this
untrue
portraiture
,
either
in
beauty
or
in
art
.
<EOS>
There
may
be
made
for
us
a
pretty
thing
to
look
at
,
no
doubt
;
 
but
we
know
that
that
pretty
thing
is
not
really
visaged
as
the
mistress
whom
we
serve
,
and
whose
lineaments
we
desire
to
perpetuate
on
the
canvas
.
<EOS>
The
winds
of
heaven
,
or
the
flesh
-
pots
of
Egypt
,
or
the
midnight
gas
,
 
passions
,
pains
,
and
,
perhaps
,
rouge
and
powder
,
have
made
her
something
different
.
<EOS>
But
there
still
is
the
fire
of
her
eye
,
and
the
eager
eloquence
of
her
mouth
,
and
something
,
too
,
perhaps
,
left
of
the
departing
innocence
of
youth
,
which
the
painter
might
give
us
without
the
Venus
or
the
Madonna
touches
.
<EOS>
But
the
painter
does
not
dare
to
do
it
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
he
has
painted
so
long
after
the
other
fashion
that
he
would
hate
the
canvas
before
him
,
were
he
to
give
way
to
the
rouge
-
begotten
roughness
or
to
the
flesh
-
pots
,
 
or
even
to
the
winds
.
<EOS>
And
how
,
my
lord
,
would
you
,
who
are
giving
hundreds
,
more
than
hundreds
,
for
this
portrait
of
your
dear
one
,
like
to
see
it
in
print
from
the
art
critic
of
the
day
,
that
she
is
a
brazen
-
faced
hoyden
who
seems
to
have
had
a
glass
of
wine
too
much
,
or
to
have
been
making
hay
?
  
<EOS>
And
so
also
has
the
reading
world
taught
itself
to
like
best
the
characters
of
all
but
divine
men
and
women
.
<EOS>
Let
the
man
who
paints
with
pen
and
ink
give
the
gas
-
light
,
and
the
flesh
-
pots
,
the
passions
and
pains
,
the
prurient
prudence
and
the
rouge
-
pots
and
pounce
-
boxes
of
the
world
as
it
is
,
and
he
will
be
told
that
no
one
can
care
a
straw
for
his
creations
.
<EOS>
With
whom
are
we
to
sympathise
?
<EOS>
says
the
reader
,
who
not
unnaturally
imagines
that
a
hero
should
be
heroic
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
thou
,
my
reader
,
whose
sympathies
are
in
truth
the
great
and
only
aim
of
my
work
,
when
you
have
called
the
dearest
of
your
friends
round
you
to
your
hospitable
table
,
how
many
heroes
are
there
sitting
at
the
board
?
<EOS>
Your
bosom
friend
,
 
even
if
he
be
a
knight
without
fear
,
is
he
a
knight
without
reproach
?
<EOS>
The
Ivanhoe
that
you
know
,
did
he
not
press
Rebecca
's
hand
?
<EOS>
Your
Lord
Evandale
,
 
did
he
not
bring
his
coronet
into
play
when
he
strove
to
win
his
Edith
Bellenden
?
<EOS>
Was
your
Tresilian
still
true
and
still
forbearing
when
truth
and
forbearance
could
avail
him
nothing
?
<EOS>
And
those
sweet
girls
whom
you
know
,
do
they
never
doubt
between
the
poor
man
they
think
they
love
,
and
the
rich
man
whose
riches
they
know
they
covet
?
  
<EOS>
Go
into
the
market
,
either
to
buy
or
sell
,
and
name
the
thing
you
desire
to
part
with
or
to
get
,
as
it
is
,
and
the
market
is
closed
against
you
.
<EOS>
Middling
oats
are
the
sweepings
of
the
granaries
.
<EOS>
A
useful
horse
is
a
jade
gone
at
every
point
.
<EOS>
Good
sound
port
is
sloe
juice
.
<EOS>
No
assurance
short
of
A
1
betokens
even
a
pretence
to
merit
.
<EOS>
And
yet
in
real
life
we
are
content
with
oats
that
are
really
middling
,
are
very
glad
to
have
a
useful
horse
,
and
know
that
if
we
drink
port
at
all
we
must
drink
some
that
is
neither
good
nor
sound
.
<EOS>
In
those
delineations
of
life
and
character
which
we
call
novels
a
similarly
superlative
vein
is
desired
.
<EOS>
Our
own
friends
around
us
are
not
always
merry
and
wise
,
nor
,
alas
!
<EOS>
always
honest
and
true
.
<EOS>
They
are
often
cross
and
foolish
,
and
sometimes
treacherous
and
false
.
<EOS>
They
are
so
,
and
we
are
angry
.
<EOS>
Then
we
forgive
them
,
not
without
a
consciousness
of
imperfection
on
our
own
part
.
<EOS>
And
we
know
 
or
,
at
least
,
believe
,
 
that
though
they
be
sometimes
treacherous
and
false
,
there
is
a
balance
of
good
.
<EOS>
We
can
not
have
heroes
to
dine
with
us
.
<EOS>
There
are
none
.
<EOS>
And
were
these
heroes
to
be
had
,
we
should
not
like
them
.
<EOS>
But
neither
are
our
friends
villains
,
 
whose
every
aspiration
is
for
evil
,
and
whose
every
moment
is
a
struggle
for
some
achievement
worthy
of
the
devil
.
  
<EOS>
The
persons
whom
you
can
not
care
for
in
a
novel
,
because
they
are
so
bad
,
are
the
very
same
that
you
so
dearly
love
in
your
life
,
because
they
are
so
good
.
<EOS>
To
make
them
and
ourselves
somewhat
better
,
 
not
by
one
spring
heavenwards
to
perfection
,
because
we
can
not
so
use
our
legs
,
 
but
by
slow
climbing
,
is
,
we
may
presume
,
the
object
of
all
teachers
,
leaders
,
legislators
,
spiritual
pastors
,
and
masters
.
<EOS>
He
who
writes
tales
such
as
this
,
probably
also
has
,
very
humbly
,
some
such
object
distantly
before
him
.
<EOS>
A
picture
of
surpassing
godlike
nobleness
,
 
a
picture
of
a
King
Arthur
among
men
,
may
perhaps
do
much
.
<EOS>
But
such
pictures
can
not
do
all
.
<EOS>
When
such
a
picture
is
painted
,
as
intending
to
show
what
a
man
should
be
,
it
is
true
.
<EOS>
If
painted
to
show
what
men
are
,
it
is
false
.
<EOS>
The
true
picture
of
life
as
it
is
,
if
it
could
be
adequately
painted
,
would
show
men
what
they
are
,
and
how
they
might
rise
,
not
,
indeed
,
to
perfection
,
but
one
step
first
,
and
then
another
,
on
the
ladder
.
  
<EOS>
Our
hero
,
Frank
Greystock
,
falling
lamentably
short
in
his
heroism
,
was
not
in
a
happy
state
of
mind
when
he
reached
Bobsborough
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
that
he
returned
to
his
own
borough
and
to
his
mother
's
arms
because
he
felt
,
that
were
he
to
determine
to
be
false
to
Lucy
,
he
would
there
receive
sympathy
in
his
treachery
.
<EOS>
His
mother
would
,
at
any
rate
,
think
that
it
was
well
,
and
his
father
would
acknowledge
that
the
fault
committed
was
in
the
original
engagement
with
poor
Lucy
,
and
not
in
the
treachery
.
<EOS>
He
had
written
that
letter
to
her
in
his
chambers
one
night
in
a
fit
of
ecstasy
;
and
could
it
be
right
that
the
ruin
of
a
whole
life
should
be
the
consequence
?
  
<EOS>
It
can
hardly
be
too
strongly
asserted
that
Lizzie
Greystock
did
not
appear
to
Frank
as
she
has
been
made
to
appear
to
the
reader
.
<EOS>
In
all
this
affair
of
the
necklace
he
was
beginning
to
believe
that
she
was
really
an
ill
-
used
woman
;
and
as
to
other
traits
in
Lizzie
's
character
,
 
traits
which
he
had
seen
,
and
which
were
not
of
a
nature
to
attract
,
 
it
must
be
remembered
that
beauty
reclining
in
a
man
's
arms
does
go
far
towards
washing
white
the
lovely
blackamoor
.
<EOS>
Lady
Linlithgow
,
upon
whom
Lizzie
's
beauty
could
have
no
effect
of
that
kind
,
had
nevertheless
declared
her
to
be
very
beautiful
.
<EOS>
And
this
loveliness
was
of
a
nature
that
was
altogether
pleasing
,
if
once
the
beholder
of
it
could
get
over
the
idea
of
falseness
which
certainly
Lizzie
's
eye
was
apt
to
convey
to
the
beholder
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
unclean
horse
's
tail
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
get
-
up
of
flounces
,
and
padding
,
and
paint
,
and
hair
,
with
a
dorsal
excrescence
appended
with
the
object
surely
of
showing
in
triumph
how
much
absurd
ugliness
women
can
force
men
to
endure
.
<EOS>
She
was
lithe
,
and
active
,
and
bright
,
 
and
was
at
this
moment
of
her
life
at
her
best
.
<EOS>
Her
growing
charms
had
as
yet
hardly
reached
the
limits
of
full
feminine
loveliness
,
 
which
,
when
reached
,
have
been
surpassed
.
<EOS>
Luxuriant
beauty
had
with
her
not
as
yet
become
comeliness
;
nor
had
age
or
the
good
things
of
the
world
added
a
pound
to
the
fairy
lightness
of
her
footstep
.
<EOS>
All
this
had
been
tendered
to
Frank
,
 
and
with
it
that
worldly
wealth
which
was
so
absolutely
necessary
to
his
career
.
<EOS>
For
though
Greystock
would
not
have
said
to
any
man
or
woman
that
nature
had
intended
him
to
be
a
spender
of
much
money
and
a
consumer
of
many
good
things
,
he
did
undoubtedly
so
think
of
himself
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
Greystock
,
and
to
what
miseries
would
he
not
reduce
his
Lucy
<EOS>
if
,
burthened
by
such
propensities
,
he
were
to
marry
her
and
then
become
an
aristocratic
pauper
!
  
<EOS>
The
offer
of
herself
by
a
woman
to
a
man
is
,
to
us
all
,
a
thing
so
distasteful
that
we
at
once
declare
that
the
woman
must
be
abominable
.
<EOS>
There
shall
be
no
whitewashing
of
Lizzie
Eustace
.
<EOS>
She
was
abominable
.
<EOS>
But
the
man
to
whom
the
offer
is
made
hardly
sees
the
thing
in
the
same
light
.
<EOS>
He
is
disposed
to
believe
that
,
in
his
peculiar
case
,
there
are
circumstances
by
which
the
woman
is
,
if
not
justified
,
at
least
excused
.
<EOS>
Frank
did
put
faith
in
his
cousin
's
love
for
himself
.
<EOS>
He
did
credit
her
when
she
told
him
that
she
had
accepted
Lord
Fawn
's
offer
in
pique
,
because
he
had
not
come
to
her
when
he
had
promised
that
he
would
come
.
<EOS>
It
did
seem
natural
to
him
that
she
should
have
desired
to
adhere
to
her
engagement
when
he
would
not
advise
her
to
depart
from
it
.
<EOS>
And
then
her
jealousy
about
Lucy
's
ring
,
and
her
abuse
of
Lucy
,
were
proofs
to
him
of
her
love
.
<EOS>
Unless
she
loved
him
,
why
should
she
care
to
marry
him
?
<EOS>
What
was
his
position
that
she
should
desire
to
share
it
;
 
unless
she
so
desired
because
he
was
dearer
to
her
than
aught
beside
?
<EOS>
He
had
not
eyes
clear
enough
to
perceive
that
his
cousin
was
a
witch
whistling
for
a
wind
,
and
ready
to
take
the
first
blast
that
would
carry
her
and
her
broomstick
somewhere
into
the
sky
.
<EOS>
And
then
,
in
that
matter
of
the
offer
,
which
in
ordinary
circumstances
certainly
should
not
have
come
from
her
to
him
,
did
not
the
fact
of
her
wealth
and
of
his
comparative
poverty
cleanse
her
from
such
stain
as
would
,
in
usual
circumstances
,
attach
to
a
woman
who
is
so
forward
?
<EOS>
He
had
not
acceded
to
her
proposition
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
denied
his
engagement
to
Lucy
.
<EOS>
He
had
left
her
presence
without
a
word
of
encouragement
,
because
of
that
engagement
.
<EOS>
But
he
believed
that
Lizzie
was
sincere
.
<EOS>
He
believed
,
now
,
that
she
was
genuine
;
though
he
had
previously
been
all
but
sure
that
falsehood
and
artifice
were
second
nature
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
At
Bobsborough
he
met
his
constituents
,
and
made
them
the
normal
autumn
speech
.
<EOS>
The
men
of
Bobsborough
were
well
pleased
and
gave
him
a
vote
of
confidence
.
<EOS>
As
none
but
those
of
his
own
party
attended
the
meeting
,
it
was
not
wonderful
that
the
vote
was
unanimous
.
<EOS>
His
father
,
mother
,
and
sister
all
heard
his
speech
,
and
there
was
a
strong
family
feeling
that
Frank
was
born
to
set
the
Greystocks
once
more
upon
their
legs
.
<EOS>
When
a
man
can
say
what
he
likes
with
the
certainty
that
every
word
will
be
reported
,
and
can
speak
to
those
around
him
as
one
manifestly
their
superior
,
he
always
looms
large
.
<EOS>
When
the
Conservatives
should
return
to
their
proper
place
at
the
head
of
affairs
,
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
Frank
Greystock
would
be
made
Solicitor
-
General
.
<EOS>
There
were
not
wanting
even
ardent
admirers
who
conceived
that
,
with
such
claims
and
such
talents
as
his
,
the
ordinary
steps
in
political
promotion
would
not
be
needed
,
and
that
he
would
become
Attorney
-
General
at
once
.
<EOS>
All
men
began
to
say
all
good
things
to
the
dean
,
and
to
Mrs.
Greystock
it
seemed
that
the
woolsack
,
or
at
least
the
Queen
's
Bench
with
a
peerage
,
was
hardly
an
uncertainty
.
<EOS>
But
then
,
 
there
must
be
no
marriage
with
a
penniless
governess
.
<EOS>
If
he
would
only
marry
his
cousin
one
might
say
that
the
woolsack
was
won
.
  
<EOS>
Then
came
Lucy
's
letter
;
the
pretty
,
dear
,
joking
letter
about
the
"
duchess
,
"
and
broken
hearts
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
break
my
heart
,
only
 
only
 
only
 
"
Yes
,
he
knew
very
well
what
she
meant
.
<EOS>
I
shall
never
be
called
upon
to
break
my
heart
,
because
you
are
not
a
false
scoundrel
.
<EOS>
If
you
were
a
false
scoundrel
,
 
instead
of
being
,
as
you
are
,
a
pearl
among
men
,
 
then
I
should
break
my
heart
.
<EOS>
That
was
what
Lucy
meant
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
have
been
much
clearer
,
and
he
understood
it
perfectly
.
<EOS>
It
is
very
nice
to
walk
about
one
's
own
borough
and
be
voted
unanimously
worthy
of
confidence
,
and
be
a
great
man
;
but
if
you
are
a
scoundrel
,
and
not
used
to
being
a
scoundrel
,
black
care
is
apt
to
sit
very
close
behind
you
as
you
go
caracoling
along
the
streets
.
  
<EOS>
Lucy
's
letter
required
an
answer
,
and
how
should
he
answer
it
?
<EOS>
He
certainly
did
not
wish
her
to
tell
Lady
Linlithgow
of
her
engagement
,
but
Lucy
clearly
wished
to
be
allowed
to
tell
,
and
on
what
ground
could
he
enjoin
her
to
be
silent
?
<EOS>
He
knew
,
or
he
thought
he
knew
,
that
till
he
answered
the
letter
,
she
would
not
tell
his
secret
,
 
and
therefore
from
day
to
day
he
put
off
the
answer
.
<EOS>
A
man
does
not
write
a
love
-
letter
easily
when
he
is
in
doubt
himself
whether
he
does
or
does
not
mean
to
be
a
scoundrel
.
  
<EOS>
Then
there
came
a
letter
to
"
Dame
"
Greystock
from
Lady
Linlithgow
,
which
filled
them
all
with
amazement
.
  
<EOS>
MY
DEAR
MADAM
,
 
[
began
the
letter
]
  
Seeing
that
your
son
is
engaged
to
marry
Miss
Morris
,
 
<EOS>
at
least
she
says
so
,
 
you
ought
not
to
have
sent
her
here
without
telling
me
all
about
it
.
<EOS>
She
says
you
know
of
the
match
,
and
she
says
that
I
can
write
to
you
if
I
please
.
<EOS>
Of
course
,
I
can
do
that
without
her
leave
.
<EOS>
But
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you
know
all
about
it
,
and
approve
the
marriage
,
your
house
and
not
mine
would
be
the
proper
place
for
her
.
  
<EOS>
I
'm
told
that
Mr.
Greystock
is
a
great
man
.
<EOS>
Any
lady
being
with
me
as
my
companion
ca
n't
be
a
great
woman
.
<EOS>
But
perhaps
you
wanted
to
break
it
off
;
 
else
you
would
have
told
me
.
<EOS>
She
shall
stay
here
six
months
,
but
then
she
must
go
.
  
<EOS>
Yours
truly
,
  
SUSANNA
LINLITHGOW
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
considered
absolutely
necessary
that
this
letter
should
be
shown
to
Frank
.
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
"
said
his
mother
,
"
she
told
the
old
lady
at
once
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
see
why
she
should
n't
.
"
<EOS>
Nevertheless
Frank
was
annoyed
.
<EOS>
Having
asked
for
permission
,
Lucy
should
at
least
have
waited
for
a
reply
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
do
n't
know
,
"
said
Mrs.
Greystock
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
generally
considered
that
young
ladies
are
more
reticent
about
such
things
.
<EOS>
She
has
blurted
it
out
and
boasted
about
it
at
once
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
thought
girls
always
told
of
their
engagements
,
"
said
Frank
,
"
and
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
for
the
life
of
me
<EOS>
see
that
there
was
any
boasting
in
it
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Then
he
was
silent
for
a
moment
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
truth
is
,
we
are
,
all
of
us
,
treating
Lucy
very
badly
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
say
that
I
see
it
,
"
said
his
mother
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
ought
to
have
had
her
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
For
how
long
,
Frank
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
For
as
long
as
a
home
was
needed
by
her
.
"
  
"
Had
you
demanded
it
,
Frank
,
she
should
have
come
,
of
course
.
<EOS>
But
neither
I
nor
your
father
could
have
had
pleasure
in
receiving
her
as
your
future
wife
.
<EOS>
You
,
yourself
,
say
that
it
can
not
be
for
two
years
at
least
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
said
one
year
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
Frank
,
you
said
two
.
<EOS>
And
we
all
know
that
such
a
marriage
would
be
ruinous
to
you
.
<EOS>
How
could
we
make
her
welcome
?
<EOS>
Can
you
see
your
way
to
having
a
house
for
her
to
live
in
within
twelve
months
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
not
a
house
?
<EOS>
I
could
have
a
house
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Such
a
house
as
would
suit
you
in
your
position
?
<EOS>
And
,
Frank
,
would
it
be
a
kindness
to
marry
her
and
then
let
her
find
that
you
were
in
debt
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
believe
she
'd
care
if
she
had
nothing
but
a
crust
to
eat
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
ought
to
care
,
Frank
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
"
said
the
dean
to
his
son
,
on
the
next
day
,
"
that
in
our
class
of
life
an
imprudent
marriage
is
the
one
thing
that
should
be
avoided
.
<EOS>
My
marriage
has
been
very
happy
,
God
knows
;
but
I
have
always
been
a
poor
man
,
and
feel
it
now
when
I
am
quite
unable
to
help
you
.
<EOS>
And
yet
your
mother
had
some
fortune
.
<EOS>
Nobody
,
I
think
,
cares
less
for
wealth
than
I
do
.
<EOS>
I
am
content
almost
with
nothing
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
nothing
with
which
the
dean
had
hitherto
been
contented
had
always
included
every
comfort
of
life
,
a
well
-
kept
table
,
good
wine
,
new
books
,
and
canonical
habiliments
with
the
gloss
still
on
;
but
as
the
Bobsborough
tradesmen
had
,
through
the
agency
of
Mrs.
Greystock
,
always
supplied
him
with
these
things
as
though
they
came
from
the
clouds
,
he
really
did
believe
that
he
had
never
asked
for
anything
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
content
almost
with
nothing
.
<EOS>
But
I
do
feel
that
marriage
can
not
be
adopted
as
the
ordinary
form
of
life
by
men
in
our
class
as
it
can
be
by
the
rich
or
by
the
poor
.
<EOS>
You
,
for
instance
,
are
called
upon
to
live
with
the
rich
,
but
are
not
rich
.
<EOS>
That
can
only
be
done
by
wary
walking
,
and
is
hardly
consistent
with
a
wife
and
children
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
men
in
my
position
do
marry
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
After
a
certain
age
,
 
or
else
they
marry
ladies
with
money
.
<EOS>
You
see
,
Frank
,
there
are
not
many
men
who
go
into
Parliament
with
means
so
moderate
as
yours
;
and
they
who
do
perhaps
have
stricter
ideas
of
economy
.
<EOS>
"
The
dean
did
not
say
a
word
about
Lucy
Morris
,
and
dealt
entirely
with
generalities
.
  
<EOS>
In
compliance
with
her
son
's
advice
,
 
or
almost
command
,
 
Mrs.
Greystock
did
not
answer
Lady
Linlithgow
's
letter
.
<EOS>
He
was
going
back
to
London
,
and
would
give
personally
,
or
by
letter
written
there
,
what
answer
might
be
necessary
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
then
see
Miss
Morris
?
"
asked
his
mother
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
certainly
see
Lucy
.
<EOS>
Something
must
be
settled
.
<EOS>
"
There
was
a
tone
in
his
voice
as
he
said
this
which
gave
some
comfort
to
his
mother
.
   
<EOS>
Lizzie
's
Guests
 
<EOS>
True
to
their
words
,
at
the
end
of
October
,
Mrs.
Carbuncle
and
Miss
Roanoke
,
and
Lord
George
de
Bruce
Carruthers
,
and
Sir
Griffin
Tewett
,
arrived
at
Portray
Castle
.
<EOS>
And
for
a
couple
of
days
there
was
a
visitor
whom
Lizzie
was
very
glad
to
welcome
,
but
of
whose
good
nature
on
the
occasion
Mr.
Camperdown
thought
very
ill
indeed
.
<EOS>
This
was
John
Eustace
.
<EOS>
His
sister
-
in
-
law
wrote
to
him
in
very
pressing
language
;
and
as
,
 
so
he
said
to
Mr.
Camperdown
,
 
he
did
not
wish
to
seem
to
quarrel
with
his
brother
's
widow
as
long
as
such
seeming
might
be
avoided
,
he
accepted
the
invitation
.
<EOS>
If
there
was
to
be
a
lawsuit
about
the
diamonds
,
that
must
be
Mr.
Camperdown
's
affair
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
had
never
entertained
her
friends
in
style
before
.
<EOS>
She
had
had
a
few
people
to
dine
with
her
in
London
,
and
once
or
twice
had
received
company
on
an
evening
.
<EOS>
But
in
all
her
London
doings
there
had
been
the
trepidation
of
fear
,
 
to
be
accounted
for
by
her
youth
and
widowhood
;
and
it
was
at
Portray
,
 
her
own
house
at
Portray
,
 
that
it
would
best
become
her
to
exercise
hospitality
.
<EOS>
She
had
bided
her
time
even
there
,
but
now
she
meant
to
show
her
friends
that
she
had
got
a
house
of
her
own
.
  
<EOS>
She
wrote
even
to
her
husband
's
uncle
,
the
bishop
,
asking
him
down
to
Portray
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
come
,
but
sent
an
affectionate
answer
,
and
thanked
her
for
thinking
of
him
.
<EOS>
Many
people
she
asked
who
,
she
felt
sure
,
would
not
come
,
 
and
one
or
two
of
them
accepted
her
invitation
.
<EOS>
John
Eustace
promised
to
be
with
her
for
two
days
.
<EOS>
When
Frank
had
left
her
,
going
out
of
her
presence
in
the
manner
that
has
been
described
,
she
actually
wrote
to
him
,
begging
him
to
join
her
party
.
<EOS>
This
was
her
note
:
  
<EOS>
"
Come
to
me
,
just
for
a
week
,
"
she
said
,
"
when
my
people
are
here
,
so
that
I
may
not
seem
to
be
deserted
.
<EOS>
Sit
at
the
bottom
of
my
table
,
and
be
to
me
as
a
brother
might
.
<EOS>
I
shall
expect
you
to
do
so
much
for
me
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
To
this
he
had
replied
that
he
would
come
during
the
first
week
in
November
.
  
<EOS>
And
she
got
a
clergyman
down
from
London
,
the
Rev.
Joseph
Emilius
,
of
whom
it
was
said
that
he
was
born
a
Jew
in
Hungary
,
and
that
his
name
in
his
own
country
had
been
Mealyus
.
<EOS>
At
the
present
time
he
was
among
the
most
eloquent
of
London
preachers
,
and
was
reputed
by
some
to
have
reached
such
a
standard
of
pulpit
-
oratory
as
to
have
had
no
equal
within
the
memory
of
living
hearers
.
<EOS>
In
regard
to
his
reading
it
was
acknowledged
that
no
one
since
Mrs.
Siddons
had
touched
him
.
<EOS>
But
he
did
not
get
on
very
well
with
any
particular
bishop
,
and
there
was
doubt
in
the
minds
of
some
people
whether
there
was
or
was
not
any
 
Mrs.
Emilius
.
<EOS>
He
had
come
up
quite
suddenly
within
the
last
season
,
and
had
made
church
-
going
quite
a
pleasant
occupation
to
Lizzie
Eustace
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
last
day
of
October
,
Mr.
Emilius
and
Mr.
John
Eustace
came
,
each
alone
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
and
Miss
Roanoke
came
over
with
post
-
horses
from
Ayr
,
 
as
also
did
Lord
George
and
Sir
Griffin
about
an
hour
after
them
.
<EOS>
Frank
was
not
yet
expected
.
<EOS>
He
had
promised
to
name
a
day
and
had
not
yet
named
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Varra
weel
;
<EOS>
varra
weel
,
"
Gowran
had
said
when
he
was
told
of
what
was
about
to
occur
,
and
was
desired
to
make
preparations
necessary
in
regard
to
the
outside
plenishing
of

And
Andy
Gowran
,
in
spite
of
the
internecine
warfare
which
existed
between
him
and
his
mistress
,
did
see
to
the
hay
,
and
the
cows
,
and
the
oats
,
and
the
extra
servants
that
were
wanted
both
inside
and
outside
the
house
.
<EOS>
There
was
enmity
between
him
and
Lady
Eustace
,
and
he
did
n't
care
who
knew
it
;
 
but
he
took
her
wages
<EOS>
and
he
did
her
work
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
was
a
wonderful
woman
.
<EOS>
She
was
the
wife
of
a
man
with
whom
she
was
very
rarely
seen
,
whom
nobody
knew
,
who
was
something
in
the
City
,
but
<EOS>
somebody
who
never
succeeded
in
making
money
;
and
yet
she
went
everywhere
.
<EOS>
She
had
at
least
the
reputation
of
going
everywhere
,
and
did
go
to
a
great
many
places
.
<EOS>
Carbuncle
had
no
money
,
 
so
it
was
said
;
and
she
had
none
.
<EOS>
She
was
the
daughter
of
a
man
who
had
gone
to
New
York
and
had
failed
there
.
<EOS>
Of
her
own
parentage
no
more
was
known
.
<EOS>
She
had
a
small
house
in
one
of
the
very
small
Mayfair
streets
,
to
which
she
was
wo
nt
to
invite
her
friends
for
five
o'clock
tea
.
<EOS>
Other
receptions
she
never
attempted
.
<EOS>
During
the
London
seasons
she
always
kept
a
carriage
,
and
during
the
winters
she
always
had
hunters
.
<EOS>
Who
paid
for
them
no
one
knew
or
cared
.
<EOS>
Her
dress
was
always
perfect
,
 
as
far
as
fit
and
performance
went
.
<EOS>
As
to
approving
Mrs.
Carbuncle
's
manner
of
dress
,
 
that
was
a
question
of
taste
.
<EOS>
Audacity
may
,
perhaps
,
be
said
to
have
been
the
ruling
principle
of
her
toilet
;
 
not
the
audacity
of
indecency
,
which
,
let
the
satirists
say
what
they
may
,
is
not
efficacious
in
England
,
but
audacity
in
colour
,
audacity
in
design
,
and
audacity
in
construction
.
<EOS>
She
would
ride
in
the
park
in
a
black
and
yellow
habit
,
and
appear
at
the
opera
in
white
velvet
without
a
speck
of
colour
.
<EOS>
Though
certainly
turned
thirty
,
and
probably
nearer
to
forty
,
she
would
wear
her
jet
-
black
hair
streaming
down
her
back
,
and
when
June
came
would
drive
about
London
in
a
straw
hat
.
<EOS>
But
yet
it
was
always
admitted
that
she
was
well
dressed
.
<EOS>
And
then
would
arise
that
question
,
who
paid
the
bills
?
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
was
certainly
a
handsome
woman
.
<EOS>
She
was
full
-
faced
,
 
with
bold
eyes
,
rather
far
apart
,
perfect
black
eyebrows
,
a
well
-
formed
broad
nose
,
thick
lips
,
and
regular
teeth
.
<EOS>
Her
chin
was
round
and
short
,
with
,
perhaps
,
a
little
bearing
towards
a
double
chin
.
<EOS>
But
though
her
face
was
plump
and
round
,
there
was
a
power
in
it
,
and
a
look
of
command
,
of
which
it
was
,
perhaps
,
difficult
to
say
in
what
features
was
the
seat
.
<EOS>
But
in
truth
the
mind
will
lend
a
tone
to
every
feature
,
and
it
was
the
desire
of
Mrs.
Carbuncle
's
heart
to
command
.
<EOS>
But
perhaps
the
wonder
of
her
face
was
its
complexion
.
<EOS>
People
said
,
 
before
they
knew
her
,
that
,
as
a
matter
of
course
,
she
had
been
made
beautiful
for
ever
.
<EOS>
But
,
though
that
too
brilliant
colour
was
almost
always
there
,
covering
the
cheeks
but
never
touching
the
forehead
or
the
neck
,
it
would
at
certain
moments
shift
,
change
,
and
even
depart
.
<EOS>
When
she
was
angry
,
it
would
vanish
for
a
moment
and
then
return
intensified
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
chemistry
on
Mrs.
Carbuncle
's
cheek
;
and
yet
it
was
a
tint
so
brilliant
and
so
little
transparent
,
as
almost
to
justify
a
conviction
that
it
could
not
be
genuine
.
<EOS>
There
were
those
who
declared
that
nothing
in
the
way
of
complexion
so
beautiful
as
that
of
Mrs.
Carbuncle
's
had
been
seen
on
the
face
of
any
other
woman
in
this
age
,
and
there
were
others
who
called
her
an
exaggerated
milkmaid
.
<EOS>
She
was
tall
,
too
,
and
had
learned
so
to
walk
as
though
half
the
world
belonged
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
Her
niece
,
Miss
Roanoke
,
was
a
lady
of
the
same
stamp
,
and
of
similar
beauty
,
with
those
additions
and
also
with
those
drawbacks
which
belong
to
youth
.
<EOS>
She
looked
as
though
she
were
four
-
and
-
twenty
,
but
in
truth
she
was
no
more
than
eighteen
.
<EOS>
When
seen
beside
her
aunt
,
she
seemed
to
be
no
more
than
half
the
elder
lady
's
size
;
and
yet
her
proportions
were
not
insignificant
.
<EOS>
She
,
too
,
was
tall
,
and
was
as
one
used
to
command
,
and
walked
as
though
she
were
a
young
Juno
.
<EOS>
Her
hair
was
very
dark
,
 
almost
black
,
 
and
very
plentiful
.
<EOS>
Her
eyes
were
large
and
bright
,
though
too
bold
for
a
girl
so
young
.
<EOS>
Her
nose
and
mouth
were
exactly
as
her
aunt
's
,
but
her
chin
was
somewhat
longer
,
so
as
to
divest
her
face
of
that
plump
roundness
which
,
perhaps
,
took
something
from
the
majesty
of
Mrs.
Carbuncle
's
appearance
.
<EOS>
Miss
Roanoke
's
complexion
was
certainly
marvellous
.
<EOS>
No
one
thought
that
she
had
been
made
beautiful
for
ever
,
for
the
colour
would
go
and
come
and
shift
and
change
with
every
word
and
every
thought
;
 
but
still
it
was
there
,
as
deep
on
her
cheeks
as
on
her
aunt
's
,
though
somewhat
more
transparent
,
and
with
more
delicacy
of
tint
as
the
bright
hues
faded
away
and
became
merged
in
the
almost
marble
whiteness
of
her
skin
.
<EOS>
With
Mrs.
Carbuncle
there
was
no
merging
and
fading
.
<EOS>
The
red
and
white
bordered
one
another
on
her
cheek
without
any
merging
,
as
they
do
on
a
flag
.
  
<EOS>
Lucinda
Roanoke
was
undoubtedly
a
very
handsome
woman
.
<EOS>
It
probably
never
occurred
to
man
or
woman
to
say
that
she
was
lovely
.
<EOS>
She
had
sat
for
her
portrait
during
the
last
winter
,
and
her
picture
had
caused
much
remark
in
the
Exhibition
.
<EOS>
Some
said
that
she
might
be
a
Brinvilliers
,
others
a
Cleopatra
,
and
others
again
a
Queen
of
Sheba
.
<EOS>
In
her
eyes
as
they
were
limned
there
had
been
nothing
certainly
of
love
,
but
they
who
likened
her
to
the
Egyptian
queen
believed
that
Cleopatra
's
love
had
always
been
used
simply
to
assist
her
ambition
.
<EOS>
They
who
took
the
Brinvilliers
side
of
the
controversy
were
men
so
used
to
softness
and
flattery
from
women
as
to
have
learned
to
think
that
a
woman
silent
,
arrogant
,
and
hard
of
approach
,
must
be
always
meditating
murder
.
<EOS>
The
disciples
of
the
Queen
of
Sheba
school
,
who
formed
,
perhaps
,
the
more
numerous
party
,
were
led
to
their
opinion
by
the
majesty
of
Lucinda
's
demeanour
rather
than
by
any
clear
idea
in
their
own
minds
of
the
lady
who
visited
Solomon
.
<EOS>
All
men
,
however
,
agreed
in
this
,
that
Lucinda
Roanoke
was
very
handsome
,
but
that
she
was
not
the
sort
of
girl
with
whom
a
man
would
wish
to
stray
away
through
the
distant
beech
-
trees
at
a
picnic
.
  
<EOS>
In
truth
she
was
silent
,
grave
,
and
,
if
not
really
haughty
,
subject
to
all
the
signs
of
haughtiness
.
<EOS>
She
went
everywhere
with
her
aunt
,
and
allowed
herself
to
be
walked
out
at
dances
,
and
to
be
accosted
when
on
horseback
,
and
to
be
spoken
to
at
parties
;
but
she
seemed
hardly
to
trouble
herself
to
talk
;
 
and
as
for
laughing
,
flirting
,
or
giggling
,
one
might
as
well
expect
such
levity
from
a
marble
Minerva
.
<EOS>
During
the
last
winter
she
had
taken
to
hunting
with
her
aunt
,
and
already
could
ride
well
to
hounds
.
<EOS>
If
assistance
were
wanted
at
a
gate
,
or
in
the
management
of
a
fence
,
and
the
servant
who
attended
the
two
ladies
were
not
near
enough
to
give
it
,
she
would
accept
it
as
her
due
from
the
man
nearest
to
her
;
but
she
rarely
did
more
than
bow
her
thanks
,
and
,
even
by
young
lords
,
or
hard
-
riding
handsome
colonels
,
or
squires
of
undoubted
thousands
,
she
could
hardly
ever
be
brought
to
what
might
be
called
a
proper
hunting
-
field
conversation
.
<EOS>
All
of
which
things
were
noted
,
and
spoken
of
,
and
admired
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
presumed
that
Lucinda
Roanoke
was
in
want
of
a
husband
,
and
yet
no
girl
seemed
to
take
less
pains
to
get
one
.
<EOS>
A
girl
ought
not
to
be
always
busying
herself
to
bring
down
a
man
,
but
a
girl
ought
to
give
herself
some
charm
.
<EOS>
A
girl
so
handsome
as
Lucinda
Roanoke
,
with
pluck
enough
to
ride
like
a
bird
<EOS>
,
dignity
enough
for
a
duchess
,
and
who
was
undoubtedly
clever
,
ought
to
put
herself
in
the
way
of
taking
such
good
things
as
her
charms
and
merits
would
bring
her
;
 
but
Lucinda
Roanoke
stood
aloof
and
despised
everybody
.
<EOS>
So
it
was
that
Lucinda
was
spoken
of
when
her
name
was
mentioned
;
and
her
name
was
mentioned
a
good
deal
after
the
opening
of
the
exhibition
of
pictures
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
some
difficulty
about
her
,
 
as
to
who
she
was
.
<EOS>
That
she
was
an
American
was
the
received
opinion
.
<EOS>
Her
mother
,
as
well
as
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
had
certainly
been
in
New
York
.
<EOS>
Carbuncle
was
a
London
man
;
but
it
was
supposed
that
Mr.
Roanoke
was
,
or
had
been
,
an
American
.
<EOS>
The
received
opinion
was
correct
.
<EOS>
Lucinda
had
been
born
in
New
York
,
had
been
educated
there
till
she
was
sixteen
,
had
then
been
taken
to
Paris
for
nine
months
,
and
from
Paris
had
been
brought
to
London
by
her
aunt
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
always
spoke
of
Lucinda
's
education
as
having
been
thoroughly
Parisian
.
<EOS>
Of
her
own
education
and
antecedents
,
Lucinda
never
spoke
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
tell
you
what
it
is
,
"
said
a
young
scamp
from
Eton
to
his
elder
sister
,
when
her
character
and
position
were
once
being
discussed
.
<EOS>
"
She
's
a
heroine
,
and
would
shoot
a
fellow
as
soon
as
look
at
him
.
"
<EOS>
In
that
scamp
's
family
,
Lucinda
was
ever
afterwards
called
the
heroine
.
  
<EOS>
The
manner
in
which
Lord
George
de
Bruce
Carruthers
had
attached
himself
to
these
ladies
was
a
mystery
;
 
but
then
Lord
George
was
always
mysterious
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
young
man
,
 
so
considered
,
 
about
forty
-
five
years
of
age
,
who
had
never
done
anything
in
the
manner
of
other
people
.
<EOS>
He
hunted
a
great
deal
,
but
he
did
not
fraternise
with
hunting
men
,
and
would
appear
now
in
this
county
and
now
in
that
,
with
an
utter
disregard
of
grass
,
fences
,
friendships
,
or
foxes
.
<EOS>
Leicester
,
Essex
,
Ayrshire
,
or
the
Baron
had
equal
delights
for
him
;
and
in
all
counties
he
was
quite
at
home
.
<EOS>
He
had
never
owned
a
fortune
,
and
had
never
been
known
to
earn
a
shilling
.
<EOS>
It
was
said
that
early
in
life
he
had
been
apprenticed
to
an
attorney
at
Aberdeen
as
George
Carruthers
.
<EOS>
His
third
cousin
,
the
Marquis
of
Killiecrankie
,
had
been
killed
out
hunting
;
the
second
scion
of
the
noble
family
had
fallen
at
Balaclava
;
a
third
had
perished
in
the
Indian
Mutiny
;
and
a
fourth
,
who
did
reign
for
a
few
months
,
died
suddenly
,
leaving
a
large
family
of
daughters
.
<EOS>
Within
three
years
the
four
brothers
vanished
,
leaving
among
them
no
male
heir
,
and
George
's
elder
brother
,
who
was
then
in
a
West
India
Regiment
,
was
called
home
from
Demerara
to
be
Marquis
of
Killiecrankie
.
<EOS>
By
a
usual
exercise
of
the
courtesy
of
the
Crown
,
all
the
brothers
were
made
lords
,
and
some
twelve
years
before
the
date
of
our
story
George
Carruthers
,
who
had
long
since
left
the
attorney
's
office
at
Aberdeen
,
became
Lord
George
de
Bruce
Carruthers
.
<EOS>
How
he
lived
no
one
knew
.
<EOS>
That
his
brother
did
much
for
him
was
presumed
to
be
impossible
,
as
the
property
entailed
on
the
Killiecrankie
title
certainly
was
not
large
.
<EOS>
He
sometimes
went
into
the
City
,
and
was
supposed
to
know
something
about
shares
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
he
played
a
little
,
and
made
a
few
bets
.
<EOS>
He
generally
lived
with
men
of
means
;
 
or
perhaps
with
one
man
of
means
at
a
time
;
but
they
who
knew
him
well
declared
that
he
never
borrowed
a
shilling
from
a
friend
,
and
never
owed
a
guinea
to
a
tradesman
.
<EOS>
He
always
had
horses
,
but
never
had
a
home
.
<EOS>
When
in
London
he
lodged
in
a
single
room
,
and
dined
at
his
club
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
Colonel
of
Volunteers
,
having
got
up
the
regiment
known
as
the
Long
Shore
Riflemen
,
 
the
roughest
regiment
of
Volunteers
in
all
England
,
 
and
was
reputed
to
be
a
bitter
Radical
.
<EOS>
He
was
suspected
even
of
republican
sentiments
,
and
ignorant
young
men
about
London
hinted
that
he
was
the
grand
centre
of
the
British
Fenians
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
invited
to
stand
for
the
Tower
Hamlets
,
but
had
told
the
deputation
which
waited
upon
him
that
he
knew
a
thing
worth
two
of
that
.
<EOS>
Would
they
guarantee
his
expenses
,
and
then
give
him
a
salary
?
<EOS>
The
deputation
doubted
its
ability
to
promise
so
much
.
<EOS>
"
I
more
than
doubt
it
,
"
said
Lord
George
;
and
then
the
deputation
went
away
.
  
<EOS>
In
person
he
was
a
long
-
legged
,
long
-
bodied
,
long
-
faced
man
,
with
rough
whiskers
and
a
rough
beard
on
his
upper
lip
,
but
with
a
shorn
chin
.
<EOS>
His
eyes
were
very
deep
set
in
his
head
,
and
his
cheeks
were
hollow
and
sallow
,
and
yet
he
looked
to
be
and
was
a
powerful
,
healthy
man
.
<EOS>
He
had
large
hands
,
which
seemed
to
be
all
bone
,
and
long
arms
,
and
a
neck
which
looked
to
be
long
because
he
so
wore
his
shirt
that
much
of
his
throat
was
always
bare
.
<EOS>
It
was
manifest
enough
that
he
liked
to
have
good
-
looking
women
about
him
,
and
yet
nobody
presumed
it
probable
that
he
would
marry
.
<EOS>
For
the
last
two
or
three
years
there
had
been
friendship
between
him
and
Mrs.
Carbuncle
;
and
during
the
last
season
he
had
become
almost
intimate
with
our
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
thought
that
perhaps
he
might
be
the
Corsair
whom
,
sooner
or
later
in
her
life
,
she
must
certainly
encounter
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Griffin
Tewett
,
who
at
the
present
period
of
his
existence
was
being
led
about
by
Lord
George
,
was
not
exactly
an
amiable
young
baronet
.
<EOS>
Nor
were
his
circumstances
such
as
make
a
man
amiable
.
<EOS>
He
was
nominally
,
not
only
the
heir
to
,
but
actually
the
possessor
of
,
a
large
property
;
 
but
he
could
not
touch
the
principal
,
and
of
the
income
only
so
much
as
certain
legal
curmudgeons
would
allow
him
.
<EOS>
As
Greystock
had
said
,
everybody
was
at
law
with
him
,
 
so
successful
had
been
his
father
in
mismanaging
,
and
miscontrolling
,
and
misappropriating
the
property
.
<EOS>
Tewett
Hall
had
gone
to
rack
and
ruin
for
four
years
,
and
was
now
let
almost
for
nothing
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
fair
,
frail
young
man
,
with
a
bad
eye
,
and
a
weak
mouth
,
and
a
thin
hand
,
who
was
fond
of
liqueurs
,
and
hated
to
the
death
any
acquaintance
who
won
a
five
-
pound
note
of
him
,
or
any
tradesman
who
wished
to
have
his
bill
paid
.
<EOS>
But
he
had
this
redeeming
quality
,
 
that
having
found
Lucinda
Roanoke
to
be
the
handsomest
woman
he
had
ever
seen
,
he
did
desire
to
make
her
his
wife
.
  
<EOS>
Such
were
the
friends
whom
Lizzie
Eustace
received
at
Portray
Castle
on
the
first
day
of
her
grand
hospitality
,
 
together
with
John
Eustace
and
Mr.
Joseph
Emilius
,
the
fashionable
preacher
from
Mayfair
.
   
<EOS>
Lizzie
's
First
Day
 
<EOS>
The
coming
of
John
Eustace
was
certainly
a
great
thing
for
Lizzie
,
though
it
was
only
for
two
days
.
<EOS>
It
saved
her
from
that
feeling
of
desertion
before
her
friends
,
 
desertion
by
those
who
might
naturally
belong
to
her
,
 
which
would
otherwise
have
afflicted
her
.
<EOS>
His
presence
there
for
two
days
gave
her
a
start
.
<EOS>
She
could
call
him
John
,
and
bring
down
her
boy
to
him
,
and
remind
him
,
with
the
sweetest
smile
,
 
with
almost
a
tear
in
her
eye
,
 
that
he
was
the
boy
's
guardian
.
"
<EOS>
Little
fellow
!
<EOS>
So
much
depends
on
that
little
life
,
 
<EOS>
does
it
not
,
John
?
<EOS>
"
she
said
,
whispering
the
words
into
his
ear
.
  
<EOS>
"
Lucky
little
dog
!
<EOS>
"
said
John
,
patting
the
boy
's
head
.
<EOS>
"
Let
me
see
!
<EOS>
of
course
he
'll
go
to
Eton
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Not
yet
,
"
said
Lizzie
with
a
shudder
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
;
no
;
hardly
;
 
when
he
's
twelve
.
"
<EOS>
And
then
the
boy
was
done
with
and
was
carried
away
.
<EOS>
She
had
played
that
card
and
had
turned
her
trick
.
<EOS>
John
Eustace
was
a
thoroughly
good
-
natured
man
of
the
world
,
who
could
forgive
many
faults
,
not
expecting
people
to
be
perfect
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
like
Mrs.
Carbuncle
;
 
was
indifferent
to
Lucinda
's
beauty
;
 
was
afraid
of
that
Tartar
,
Lord
George
;
 
and
thoroughly
despised
Sir
Griffin
.
<EOS>
In
his
heart
he
believed
Mr.
Emilius
to
be
an
impostor
,
who
might
,
for
aught
he
knew
,
pick
his
pocket
;
and
Miss
Macnulty
had
no
attraction
for
him
.
<EOS>
But
he
smiled
,
and
was
gay
,
and
called
Lady
Eustace
by
her
Christian
name
,
and
was
content
to
be
of
use
to
her
in
showing
her
friends
that
she
had
not
been
altogether
dropped
by
the
Eustace
people
.
<EOS>
"
I
got
such
a
nice
affectionate
letter
from
the
dear
bishop
,
"
said
Lizzie
,
"
but
he
could
n't
come
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
escape
a
previous
engagement
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
long
way
,
"
said
John
,
"
and
he
's
not
so
young
as
he
was
once
;
 
and
then
there
are
the
Bobsborough
parsons
to
look
after
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
suppose
anything
of
that
kind
stops
him
,
"
said
Lizzie
,
who
did
not
think
it
possible
that
a
bishop
's
bliss
should
be
alloyed
by
work
.
<EOS>
John
was
so
very
nice
that
she
almost
made
up
her
mind
to
talk
to
him
about
the
necklace
;
but
she
was
cautious
,
and
thought
of
it
,
and
found
that
it
would
be
better
that
she
should
abstain
.
<EOS>
John
Eustace
was
certainly
very
good
-
natured
,
but
perhaps
he
might
say
an
ugly
word
to
her
if
she
were
rash
.
<EOS>
She
refrained
,
therefore
,
and
after
breakfast
on
the
second
day
he
took
his
departure
without
an
allusion
to
things
that
were
unpleasant
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
call
my
brother
-
in
-
law
a
perfect
gentleman
,
"
said
Lizzie
with
enthusiasm
,
when
his
back
was
turned
.
  
<EOS>
"
Certainly
,
"
said
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
seems
to
me
to
be
very
quiet
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
did
n't
quite
like
his
party
,
"
said
Lord
George
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
he
did
,
"
said
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
mean
as
to
politics
.
<EOS>
To
him
we
are
all
turbulent
demagogues
and
Bohemians
.
<EOS>
Eustace
is
an
old
-
world
Tory
,
if
there
's
one
left
anywhere
.
<EOS>
But
you
're
right
,
Lady
Eustace
;
he
is
a
gentleman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
knows
on
which
side
his
bread
is
buttered
as
well
as
any
man
,
"
said
Sir
Griffin
.
  
<EOS>
"
Am
I
a
demagogue
,
"
said
Lizzie
,
appealing
to
the
Corsair
,
"
or
a
Bohemian
?
<EOS>
I
did
n't
know
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
A
little
in
that
way
,
I
think
,
Lady
Eustace
;
 
not
a
demagogue
,
but
demagognical
;
 
not
a
Bohemian
,
but
that
way
given
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
is
Miss
Roanoke
demagognical
?
"
  
"
Certainly
,
"
said
Lord
George
.
<EOS>
"
I
hardly
wrong
you
there
,
Miss
Roanoke
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Lucinda
is
a
democrat
,
but
hardly
a
demagogue
,
Lord
George
,
"
said
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
  
<EOS>
"
Those
are
distinctions
which
we
hardly
understand
on
this
thick
-
headed
side
of
the
water
.
<EOS>
But
demagogues
,
democrats
,
demonstrations
,
and
Demosthenic
oratory
are
all
equally
odious
to
John
Eustace
.
<EOS>
For
a
young
man
he
's
about
the
best
Tory
I
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
true
to
his
colours
,
"
said
Mr.
Emilius
,
who
had
been
endeavouring
to
awake
the
attention
of
Miss
Roanoke
on
the
subject
of
Shakespeare
's
dramatic
action
,
"
and
I
like
men
who
are
true
to
their
colours
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Emilius
spoke
with
the
slightest
possible
tone
of
a
foreign
accent
,
 
a
tone
so
slight
that
it
simply
served
to
attract
attention
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
While
Eustace
was
still
in
the
house
,
there
had
come
a
letter
from
Frank
Greystock
,
saying
that
he
would
reach
Portray
,
by
way
of
Glasgow
,
on
Wednesday
,
the
5th
of
November
.
<EOS>
He
must
sleep
in
Glasgow
on
that
night
,
having
business
,
or
friends
,
or
pleasure
demanding
his
attention
in
that
prosperous
mart
of
commerce
.
<EOS>
It
had
been
impressed
upon
him
that
he
should
hunt
,
and
he
had
consented
.
<EOS>
There
was
to
be
a
meet
out
on
the
Kilmarnock
side
of
the
county
on
that
Wednesday
,
and
he
would
bring
a
horse
with
him
from
Glasgow
.
<EOS>
Even
in
Glasgow
a
hunter
was
to
be
hired
,
and
could
be
sent
forty
or
fifty
miles
out
of
the
town
in
the
morning
and
brought
back
in
the
evening
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
had
learned
all
about
that
,
and
had
told
him
.
<EOS>
If
he
would
call
at
MacFarlane
's
stables
in
Buchanan
Street
,
or
even
write
to
Mr.
MacFarlane
,
he
would
be
sure
to
get
a
horse
that
would
carry
him
.
<EOS>
MacFarlane
was
sending
horses
down
into
the
Ayrshire
country
every
day
of
his
life
.
<EOS>
It
was
simply
an
affair
of
money
.
<EOS>
Three
guineas
for
the
horse
,
and
then
just
the
expense
of
the
railway
.
<EOS>
Frank
,
who
knew
quite
as
much
about
it
as
did
his
cousin
,
and
who
never
thought
much
of
guineas
or
of
railway
tickets
,
promised
to
meet
the
party
at
the
meet
ready
equipped
.
<EOS>
His
things
would
go
on
by
train
,
and
Lizzie
must
send
for
them
to
Troon
.
<EOS>
He
presumed
a
beneficent
Providence
would
take
the
horse
back
to
the
bosom
of
Mr.
MacFarlane
.
<EOS>
Such
was
the
tenour
of
his
letter
.
<EOS>
"
If
he
do
n't
mind
,
he
'll
find
himself
astray
,
"
said
Sir
Griffin
.
<EOS>
"
He
'll
have
to
go
one
way
by
rail
and
his
horse
another
.
"
<EOS>
"
We
can
manage
better
for
our
cousin
than
that
,
"
said
Lizzie
,
with
a
rebuking
nod
.
  
<EOS>
But
there
was
hunting
from
Portray
before
Frank
Greystock
came
.
<EOS>
It
was
specially
a
hunting
party
,
and
Lizzie
was
to
be
introduced
to
the
glories
of
the
field
.
<EOS>
In
giving
her
her
due
,
it
must
be
acknowledged
that
she
was
fit
for
the
work
.
<EOS>
She
rode
well
,
though
she
had
not
ridden
to
hounds
,
and
her
courage
was
cool
.
<EOS>
She
looked
well
on
horseback
,
and
had
that
presence
of
mind
which
should
never
desert
a
lady
when
she
is
hunting
.
<EOS>
A
couple
of
horses
had
been
purchased
for
her
,
under
Lord
George
's
superintendence
,
 
his
conjointly
with
Mrs.
Carbuncle
's
,
 
and
had
been
at
the
castle
for
the
last
ten
days
 
"
eating
their
varra
heeds
off
,
"
as
Andy
Gowran
had
said
in
sorrow
.
<EOS>
There
had
been
practising
even
while
John
Eustace
was
there
,
and
before
her
preceptors
had
slept
three
nights
at
the
castle
,
she
had
ridden
backwards
and
forwards
half
-
a
-
dozen
times
over
a
stone
wall
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
yes
,
"
Lucinda
had
said
,
in
answer
to
a
remark
from
Sir
Griffin
,
"
It
's
easy
enough
,
 
till
you
come
across
something
difficult
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nothing
difficult
stops
you
,
"
said
Sir
Griffin
;
 
to
which
compliment
Lucinda
vouchsafed
no
reply
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
Monday
Lizzie
went
out
hunting
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
owned
that
,
as
she
put
her
habit
on
,
and
afterwards
breakfasted
with
all
her
guests
in
hunting
gear
around
her
,
and
then
was
driven
with
them
in
her
own
carriage
to
the
meet
,
there
was
something
of
trepidation
at
her
heart
.
<EOS>
And
her
feeling
of
cautious
fear
in
regard
to
money
had
received
a
shock
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
had
told
her
that
a
couple
of
horses
fit
to
carry
her
might
perhaps
cost
her
about
£
180
.
<EOS>
Lord
George
had
received
the
commission
,
and
the
cheque
required
from
her
had
been
for
£
320
.
<EOS>
Of
course
she
had
written
the
cheque
without
a
word
,
but
it
did
begin
to
occur
to
her
that
hunting
was
an
expensive
amusement
.
<EOS>
Gowran
had
informed
her
that
he
had
bought
a
rick
of
hay
from
a
neighbour
for
£
75
15s
.
<EOS>
9d
.
<EOS>
"
God
forgie
me
,
"
said
Andy
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
b'lieve
<EOS>
I
've
been
o'er
hard
on
the
puir
man
in
your
leddyship
's
service
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
£
75
15s
.
<EOS>
9d
.
<EOS>
did
seem
a
great
deal
of
money
to
pay
;
and
could
it
be
necessary
that
she
should
buy
a
whole
rick
?
<EOS>
There
were
to
be
eight
horses
in
the
stable
.
<EOS>
To
what
friend
could
she
apply
to
learn
how
much
of
a
rick
of
hay
<EOS>
one
horse
ought
to
eat
in
a
month
of
hunting
?
<EOS>
In
such
a
matter
she
might
have
trusted
Andy
Gowran
implicitly
;
but
how
was
she
to
know
that
?
<EOS>
And
then
,
what
if
at
some
desperate
fence
she
were
to
be
thrown
off
and
break
her
nose
and
knock
out
her
front
teeth
!
<EOS>
Was
the
game
worth
the
candle
?
<EOS>
She
was
by
no
means
sure
that
she
liked
Mrs.
Carbuncle
very
much
.
<EOS>
And
though
she
liked
Lord
George
very
well
,
could
it
be
possible
that
he
bought
the
horses
for
£
90
each
and
charged
her
£
160
?
<EOS>
Corsairs
do
do
these
sort
of
things
.
<EOS>
The
horses
themselves
were
two
sweet
dears
,
with
stars
on
their
foreheads
,
and
shining
coats
,
and
a
delicious
aptitude
for
jumping
over
everything
at
a
moment
's
notice
.
<EOS>
Lord
George
had
not
,
in
truth
,
made
a
penny
by
them
,
and
they
were
good
hunters
,
worth
the
money
;
 
but
<EOS>
how
was
Lizzie
to
know
that
?
<EOS>
But
though
she
doubted
,
and
was
full
of
fears
,
she
could
smile
and
look
as
though
she
liked
it
.
<EOS>
If
the
worst
should
come
she
could
certainly
get
money
for
the
diamonds
.
  
<EOS>
On
that
Monday
the
meet
was
comparatively
near
to
them
,
 
distant
only
twelve
miles
.
<EOS>
On
the
following
Wednesday
it
would
be
sixteen
,
and
they
would
use
the
railway
,
 
having
the
carriage
sent
to
meet
them
in
the
evening
.
<EOS>
The
three
ladies
and
Lord
George
filled
the
carriage
,
and
Sir
Griffin
was
perched
upon
the
box
.
<EOS>
The
ladies
"
horses
had
gone
on
with
two
grooms
,
and
those
for
Lord
George
and
Sir
Griffin
were
to
come
to
the
meet
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
felt
somewhat
proud
of
her
establishment
and
her
equipage
;
 
but
at
the
same
time
somewhat
fearful
.
<EOS>
Hitherto
she
knew
but
very
little
of
the
county
people
,
and
was
not
sure
how
she
might
be
received
;
 
and
then
how
would
it
be
with
her
if
the
fox
should
at
once
start
away
across
country
,
and
she
should
lack
either
the
pluck
or
the
power
to
follow
?
<EOS>
There
was
Sir
Griffin
to
look
after
Miss
Roanoke
,
and
Lord
George
to
attend
to
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
<EOS>
At
last
an
idea
<EOS>
so
horrible
struck
her
that
she
could
not
keep
it
down
.
<EOS>
"
What
am
I
to
do
,
"
she
said
,
"
if
I
find
myself
all
alone
in
a
field
,
and
everybody
else
gone
away
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
wo
n't
treat
you
quite
in
that
fashion
,
"
said
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
only
possible
way
in
which
you
can
be
alone
in
a
field
is
that
you
will
have
cut
everybody
else
down
,
"
said
Lord
George
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
it
will
all
come
right
,
"
said
Lizzie
,
plucking
up
her
courage
,
and
telling
herself
that
a
woman
can
die
but
once
.
  
<EOS>
Everything
was
right
,
 
as
it
usually
is
.
<EOS>
The
horses
were
there
,
 
quite
a
throng
of
horses
,
as
the
two
gentlemen
had
two
each
;
and
there
was
,
moreover
,
a
mounted
groom
to
look
after
the
three
ladies
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
had
desired
to
have
a
groom
to
herself
,
but
had
been
told
that
the
expenditure
in
horseflesh
was
more
than
the
stable
could
stand
.
<EOS>
"
All
I
ever
want
of
a
man
is
to
carry
for
me
my
flask
,
and
waterproof
,
and
luncheon
,
"
said
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
care
if
I
never
see
a
groom
,
except
for
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
convenient
to
have
a
gate
opened
sometimes
,
"
said
Lucinda
,
slowly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Will
no
one
but
a
groom
do
that
for
you
?
"
asked
Sir
Griffin
.
  
<EOS>
"
Gentlemen
ca
n't
open
gates
,
"
said
Lucinda
.
<EOS>
Now
,
as
Sir
Griffin
thought
that
he
had
opened
many
gates
during
the
last
season
for
Miss
Roanoke
,
he
felt
this
to
be
hard
.
  
<EOS>
But
there
were
eight
horses
,
and
eight
horses
with
three
servants
and
a
carriage
made
quite
a
throng
.
<EOS>
Among
the
crowd
of
Ayrshire
hunting
men
,
 
a
lord
or
two
,
a
dozen
lairds
,
two
dozen
farmers
,
and
as
many
men
of
business
out
of
Ayr
,
Kilmarnock
,
and
away
from
Glasgow
,
 
it
was
soon
told
that
Lady
Eustace
and
her
party
were
among
them
.
<EOS>
A
good
deal
had
been
already
heard
of
Lizzie
,
and
it
was
at
least
known
of
her
that
she
had
,
for
her
life
,
the
Portray
estate
in
her
hands
.
<EOS>
So
there
was
an
undercurrent
of
whispering
,
and
that
sort
of
commotion
which
the
appearance
of
new
-
comers
does
produce
at
a
hunt
-
meet
.
<EOS>
Lord
George
knew
one
or
two
men
,
who
were
surprised
to
find
him
in
Ayrshire
,
and
Mrs.
Carbuncle
was
soon
quite
at
home
with
a
young
nobleman
whom
she
had
met
in
the
vale
with
the
Baron
.
<EOS>
Sir
Griffin
did
not
leave
Lucinda
's
side
,
and
for
a
while
poor
Lizzie
felt
herself
alone
in
a
crowd
.
  
<EOS>
Who
does
not
know
that
terrible
feeling
,
and
the
all
but
necessity
that
exists
for
the
sufferer
to
pretend
that
he
is
not
suffering
,
 
which
again
is
aggravated
by
the
conviction
that
the
pretence
is
utterly
vain
?
<EOS>
This
may
be
bad
with
a
man
,
but
with
a
woman
,
who
never
looks
to
be
alone
in
a
crowd
,
it
is
terrible
.
<EOS>
For
five
minutes
,
during
which
everybody
else
was
speaking
to
everybody
,
 
for
five
minutes
,
which
seemed
to
her
to
be
an
hour
,
Lizzie
spoke
to
no
one
,
and
no
one
spoke
to
her
.
<EOS>
Was
it
for
such
misery
as
this
that
she
was
spending
hundreds
upon
hundreds
,
and
running
herself
into
debt
?
<EOS>
For
she
was
sure
that
there
would
be
debt
before
she
had
parted
with
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
<EOS>
There
are
people
,
very
many
people
,
to
whom
an
act
of
hospitality
is
in
itself
a
good
thing
;
but
there
are
others
who
are
always
making
calculations
,
and
endeavouring
to
count
up
the
thing
purchased
against
the
cost
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
had
been
told
that
she
was
a
rich
woman
,
 
as
women
go
,
very
rich
.
<EOS>
Surely
she
was
entitled
to
entertain
a
few
friends
;
and
if
Mrs.
Carbuncle
and
Miss
Roanoke
could
hunt
,
it
could
not
be
that
hunting
was
beyond
her
own
means
.
<EOS>
And
yet
she
was
spending
a
great
deal
of
money
.
<EOS>
She
had
seen
a
large
waggon
loaded
with
sacks
of
corn
coming
up
the
hill
to
the
Portray
stables
,
and
she
knew
that
there
would
be
a
long
bill
at
the
corn
-
chandler
's
.
<EOS>
There
had
been
found
a
supply
of
wine
in
the
cellars
at
Portray
,
 
which
at
her
request
had
been
inspected
by
her
cousin
Frank
;
 
but
it
had
been
necessary
,
so
he
had
told
her
,
to
have
much
more
sent
down
from
London
,
 
champagne
,
and
liqueurs
,
and
other
nice
things
that
cost
money
.
<EOS>
"
You
wo
n't
like
not
to
have
them
if
these
people
are
coming
?
"
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
no
;
certainly
not
,
"
said
Lizzie
,
with
enthusiasm
.
<EOS>
What
other
rich
people
did
,
she
would
do
.
<EOS>
But
now
,
in
her
five
minutes
of
misery
,
she
counted
it
all
up
,
and
was
at
a
loss
to
find
what
was
to
be
her
return
for
her
expenditure
.
<EOS>
And
then
,
if
on
this
her
first
day
she
should
have
a
fall
,
with
no
tender
hand
to
help
her
,
and
then
find
that
she
had
knocked
out
her
front
teeth
!
  
<EOS>
But
the
cavalcade
began
to
move
,
and
then
Lord
George
was
by
her
side
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
n't
be
angry
if
I
seem
to
stick
too
close
to
you
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
She
gave
him
her
sweetest
smile
as
she
told
him
that
that
would
be
impossible
.
"
<EOS>
Because
,
you
know
,
though
it
's
the
easiest
thing
in
the
world
to
get
along
out
hunting
,
and
women
never
come
to
grief
,
a
person
is
a
little
astray
at
first
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
so
much
astray
,
"
said
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
at
all
know
how
we
are
going
to
begin
.
<EOS>
Are
we
hunting
a
fox
now
?
<EOS>
"
At
this
moment
they
were
trotting
across
a
field
or
two
,
through
a
run
of
gates
up
to
the
first
covert
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
quite
yet
.
<EOS>
The
hounds
have
n't
been
put
in
yet
.
<EOS>
You
see
that
wood
there
?
<EOS>
I
suppose
they
'll
draw
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
drawing
,
Lord
George
?
<EOS>
I
want
to
know
all
about
it
,
and
I
am
so
ignorant
.
<EOS>
Nobody
else
will
tell
me
.
"
<EOS>
Then
Lord
George
gave
his
lesson
,
and
explained
the
theory
and
system
of
fox
-
hunting
.
<EOS>
"
We
're
to
wait
here
,
then
,
till
the
fox
runs
away
?
<EOS>
But
it
's
ever
so
large
,
and
if
he
runs
away
,
and
nobody
sees
him
?
<EOS>
I
hope
he
will
,
because
it
will
be
nice
to
go
on
easily
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
great
many
people
hope
that
,
and
a
great
many
think
it
nice
to
go
on
easily
.
<EOS>
Only
you
must
not
confess
to
it
.
"
<EOS>
Then
he
went
on
with
his
lecture
,
and
explained
the
meaning
of
scent
,
was
great
on
the
difficulty
of
getting
away
,
described
the
iniquity
of
heading
the
fox
,
spoke
of
up
wind
and
down
wind
,
got
as
far
as
the
trouble
of
"
carrying
,
"
and
told
her
that
a
good
ear
was
everything
in
a
big
wood
,
 
when
there
came
upon
them
the
thrice
-
repeated
note
of
an
old
hound
's
voice
,
and
the
quick
scampering
,
and
low
,
timid
,
anxious
,
trustful
whinnying
of
a
dozen
comrade
younger
hounds
,
who
recognised
the
sagacity
of
their
well
-
known
and
highly
-
appreciated
elder
,
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
a
fox
,
"
said
Lord
George
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
shall
I
do
now
?
"
said
Lizzie
,
all
in
a
twitter
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sit
just
where
you
are
and
light
a
cigar
,
if
you
're
given
to
smoking
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Pray
do
n't
joke
with
me
.
<EOS>
You
know
I
want
to
do
it
properly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
therefore
you
must
sit
just
where
you
are
,
and
not
gallop
about
.
<EOS>
There
's
a
matter
of
a
hundred
and
twenty
acres
here
,
I
should
say
,
and
a
fox
does
n't
always
choose
to
be
evicted
at
the
first
notice
.
<EOS>
It
's
a
chance
whether
he
goes
at
all
from
a
wood
like
this
.
<EOS>
I
like
woods
myself
,
because
,
as
you
say
,
we
can
take
it
easy
;
but
if
you
want
to
ride
,
you
should
 
By
George
,
they
've
killed
him
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Killed
the
fox
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
he
's
dead
.
<EOS>
Did
n't
you
hear
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
is
that
a
hunt
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
;
 
as
far
as
it
goes
,
it
is
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
did
n't
he
run
away
?
<EOS>
What
a
stupid
beast
!
<EOS>
I
do
n't
see
so
very
much
in
that
.
<EOS>
Who
killed
him
?
<EOS>
That
man
that
was
blowing
the
horn
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
hounds
chopped
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Chopped
him
!
"
<EOS>
Lord
George
was
very
patient
,
and
explained
to
Lizzie
,
who
was
now
indignant
and
disappointed
,
the
misfortune
of
chopping
.
"
<EOS>
And
are
we
to
go
home
now
?
<EOS>
Is
it
all
over
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
say
the
country
is
full
of
foxes
,
"
said
Lord
George
.
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
we
shall
chop
half
-
a
-
dozen
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
!
<EOS>
Chop
half
-
a
-
dozen
foxes
!
<EOS>
Do
they
like
to
be
chopped
?
<EOS>
I
thought
they
always
ran
away
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lord
George
was
constant
and
patient
,
and
rode
at
Lizzie
's
side
from
covert
to
covert
.
<EOS>
A
second
fox
they
did
kill
in
the
same
fashion
as
the
first
;
a
third
they
could
n't
hunt
a
yard
;
a
fourth
got
to
ground
after
five
minutes
,
and
was
dug
out
ingloriously
;
 
during
which
process
a
drizzling
rain
commenced
.
<EOS>
"
Where
is
the
man
with
my
waterproof
?
"
demanded
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
<EOS>
Lord
George
had
sent
the
man
to
see
whether
there
was
shelter
to
be
had
in
a
neighbouring
yard
.
<EOS>
And
Mrs.
Carbuncle
was
angry
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
my
own
fault
,
"
she
said
,
"
for
not
having
my
own
man
.
<EOS>
Lucinda
,
you
'll
be
wet
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
mind
the
wet
,
"
said
Lucinda
.
<EOS>
Lucinda
never
did
mind
anything
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
'll
come
with
me
,
we
'll
get
into
a
barn
,
"
said
Sir
Griffin
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
like
the
wet
,
"
said
Lucinda
.
<EOS>
All
the
while
seven
men
were
at
work
with
picks
and
shovels
,
and
the
master
and
four
or
five
of
the
more
ardent
sportsmen
were
deeply
engaged
in
what
seemed
to
be
a
mining
operation
on
a
small
scale
.
<EOS>
The
huntsman
stood
over
giving
his
orders
.
<EOS>
One
enthusiastic
man
,
who
had
been
lying
on
his
belly
,
grovelling
in
the
mud
for
five
minutes
,
with
a
long
stick
in
his
hand
,
was
now
applying
the
point
of
it
scientifically
to
his
nose
.
<EOS>
An
ordinary
observer
with
a
magnifying
-
glass
might
have
seen
a
hair
at
the
end
of
the
stick
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
's
there
,
"
said
the
enthusiastic
man
,
covered
with
mud
,
after
a
long
-
drawn
,
eager
sniff
at
the
stick
.
<EOS>
The
huntsman
deigned
to
give
one
glance
.
<EOS>
"
That
's
rabbit
,
"
said
the
huntsman
.
<EOS>
A
conclave
was
immediately
formed
over
the
one
visible
hair
that
stuck
to
the
stick
,
and
three
experienced
farmers
decided
that
it
was
rabbit
.
<EOS>
The
muddy
enthusiastic
man
,
silenced
but
not
convinced
,
retired
from
the
crowd
,
leaving
his
stick
behind
him
,
and
comforted
himself
with
his
brandy
-
flask
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
's
here
,
my
lord
,
"
said
the
huntsman
to
his
noble
master
,
"
only
we
ai
n't
got
nigh
him
yet
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
spoke
almost
in
a
whisper
,
so
that
the
ignorant
crowd
should
not
hear
the
words
of
wisdom
,
which
they
would
n't
understand
or
perhaps
believe
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
that
full
of
rabbits
that
the
holes
is
all
hairs
.
<EOS>
They
ai
n't
got
no
terrier
here
,
I
suppose
.
<EOS>
They
never
has
aught
that
is
wanted
in
these
parts
.
<EOS>
Work
round
to
the
right
,
there
;
 
that
's
his
line
.
<EOS>
"
The
men
did
work
round
to
the
right
,
and
in
something
under
an
hour
the
fox
was
dragged
out
by
his
brush
and
hind
legs
,
while
the
experienced
whip
who
dragged
him
held
the
poor
brute
tight
by
the
back
of
his
neck
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
An
old
dog

my
lord

There
's
such
a
many
of
"
em
here
,
that
they
'll
be
a
deal
better
for
a
little
killing
.
"
<EOS>
Then
the
hounds
ate
their
third
fox
for
that
day
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Eustace
,
in
the
meantime
,
and
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
with
Lord
George
,
had
found
their
way
to
the
shelter
of
a
cattle
-
shed
.
<EOS>
Lucinda
had
slowly
followed
,
and
Sir
Griffin
had
followed
her
.
<EOS>
The
gentlemen
smoked
cigars
,
and
the
ladies
,
when
they
had
eaten
their
luncheons
and
drank
their
sherry
,
were
cold
and
cross
.
<EOS>
"
If
this
is
hunting
,
"
said
Lizzie
,
"
I
really
do
n't
think
so
much
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
Scotch
hunting
,
"
said
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
seen
foxes
dug
out
south
of
the
Tweed
,
"
suggested
Lord
George
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
everything
is
slow
after
the
Baron
,
"
said
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
who
had
distinguished
herself
with
the
Baron
's
stag
-
hounds
last
March
.
  
<EOS>
"
Are
we
to
go
home
now
?
"
asked
Lizzie
,
who
would
have
been
well
-
pleased
to
have
received
an
answer
in
the
affirmative
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
presume
they
'll
draw
again
,
"
exclaimed
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
with
an
angry
frown
on
her
brow
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
hardly
two
o'clock
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
always
draw
till
seven
,
in
Scotland
,
"
said
Lord
George
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
nonsense
,
"
said
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
dark
at
four
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
have
torches
in
Scotland
,
"
said
Lord
George
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
have
a
great
many
things
in
Scotland
that
are
very
far
from
agreeable
,
"
said
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
<EOS>
"
Lucinda
,
did
you
ever
see
three
foxes
killed
without
five
minutes
"
running
,
before
?
<EOS>
I
never
did
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
've
been
out
all
day
without
finding
at
all
,
"
said
Lucinda
,
who
loved
the
truth
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
so
have
I
,
"
said
Sir
Griffin
;
 
"
often
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
remember
that
day
when
we
went
down
from
London
to
Bringher
Wood
,
and
they
pretended
to
find
at
half
-
past
four
?
<EOS>
That
's
what
I
call
a
sell
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
're
going
on
,
Lady
Eustace
,
"
said
Lord
George
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
're
not
tired
,
we
might
as
well
see
it
out
.
<EOS>
"
Lizzie
was
tired
,
but
said
that
she
was
not
,
and
she
did
see
it
out
.
<EOS>
They
found
a
fifth
fox
,
but
again
there
was
no
scent
.
<EOS>
"
Who
the
 
---
is
to
hunt
a
fox
with
people
scurrying
about
like
that
!
"
said
the
huntsman
,
very
angrily
,
dashing
forward
at
a
couple
of
riders
.
<EOS>
"
The
hounds
is
behind
you
,
only
you
ai
n't
a
-
looking
.
<EOS>
Some
people
never
do
look
!
"
<EOS>
The
two
peccant
riders
unfortunately
were
Sir
Griffin
and
Lucinda
.
  
<EOS>
The
day
was
one
of
those
from
which
all
the
men
and
women
return
home
cross
,
and
which
induce
some
half
-
hearted
folk
to
declare
to
themselves
that
they
never
will
hunt
again
.
<EOS>
When
the
master
decided
a
little
after
three
that
he
would
draw
no
more
,
because
there
was
n't
a
yard
of
scent
,
our
party
had
nine
or
ten
miles
to
ride
back
to
their
carriages
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
was
very
tired
,
and
,
when
Lord
George
took
her
from
her
horse
,
could
almost
have
cried
from
fatigue
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
was
never
fatigued
,
but
she
had
become
damp
,
 
soaking
wet
through
,
as
she
herself
said
,
 
during
the
four
minutes
that
the
man
was
absent
with
her
waterproof
jacket
,
and
could
not
bring
herself
to
forget
the
ill
-
usage
she
had
suffered
.
<EOS>
Lucinda
had
become
absolutely
dumb
,
and
any
observer
would
have
fancied
that
the
two
gentlemen
had
quarrelled
with
each
other
.
<EOS>
"
You
ought
to
go
on
the
box
now
,
"
said
Sir
Griffin
,
grumbling
.
<EOS>
"
When
you
're
my
age
,
and
I
'm
yours
,
I
will
,
"
said
Lord
George
,
taking
his
seat
in
the
carriage
.
<EOS>
Then
he
appealed
to
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
"
You
'll
let
me
smoke
,
wo
n't
you
?
"
<EOS>
She
simply
bowed
her
head
.
<EOS>
And
so
they
went
home
,
 
Lord
George
smoking
,
and
the
ladies
dumb
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
,
as
she
dressed
for
dinner
,
almost
cried
with
vexation
and
disappointment
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
little
conversation
up
-
stairs
between
Mrs.
Carbuncle
and
Lucinda
,
when
they
were
free
from
the
attendance
of
their
joint
maid
.
<EOS>
"
It
seems
to
me
,
"
said
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
"
that
you
wo
n't
make
up
your
mind
about
anything
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
nothing
to
make
up
my
mind
about
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
there
is
;
 
a
great
deal
.
<EOS>
Do
you
mean
to
take
this
man
who
is
dangling
after
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
n't
worth
taking
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Carruthers
says
that
the
property
must
come
right
,
sooner
or
later
.
<EOS>
You
might
do
better
,
perhaps
,
but
you
wo
n't
trouble
yourself
.
<EOS>
We
ca
n't
go
on
like
this
for
ever
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
hated
it
as
much
as
I
do
,
you
would
n't
want
to
go
on
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
do
n't
you
talk
to
him
?
<EOS>
I
do
n't
think
he
's
at
all
a
bad
fellow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
've
nothing
to
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
He
'll
offer
to
-
morrow
,
if
you
'll
accept
him
.
"
  
"
Do
n't
let
him
do
that
,
Aunt
Jane
.
<EOS>
I
could
n't
say
Yes
.
<EOS>
As
for
loving
him
;
 
oh
,
laws
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
wo
n't
do
to
go
on
like
this
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
only
eighteen
;
 
and
it
's
my
money
,
aunt
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
how
long
will
it
last
?
<EOS>
If
you
ca
n't
accept
him
,
refuse
him
,
and
let
somebody
else
come
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
seems
to
me
,
"
said
Lucinda
,
"
that
one
is
as
bad
as
another
.
<EOS>
I
'd
a
deal
sooner
marry
a
shoemaker
and
help
him
to
make
shoes
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
downright
wickedness
,
"
said
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
<EOS>
And
then
they
went
down
to
dinner
.
   
<EOS>
Nappie
's
Grey
Horse
 
<EOS>
During
the
leisure
of
Tuesday
,
our
friends
regained
their
good
humour
,
and
on
the
Wednesday
morning
they
again
started
for
the
hunting
-
field
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
who
probably
felt
that
she
had
behaved
ill
about
the
groom
and
in
regard
to
Scotland
,
almost
made
an
apology
,
and
explained
that
a
cold
shower
always
did
make
her
cross
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
Lady
Eustace
,
I
hope
I
was
n't
very
savage
.
"
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
I
hope
I
was
n't
very
stupid
,
"
said
Lizzie
with
a
smile
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
Lady
Eustace
,
and
my
dear
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
and
my
dear
Miss
Roanoke
<EOS>
,
I
hope
I
was
n't
very
selfish
,
"
said
Lord
George
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
thought
you
were
,
"
said
Sir
Griffin
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Griff
;
and
so
were
you
;
 
but
I
succeeded
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
almost
glad
that
I
was
n't
of
the
party
,
"
said
Mr.
Emilius
,
with
that
musical
foreign
tone
of
his
.
"
<EOS>
Miss
Macnulty
and
<EOS>
I
did
not
quarrel
;
did
we
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
indeed
,
"
said
Miss
Macnulty
,
who
had
liked
the
society
of
Mr.
Emilius
.
  
<EOS>
But
on
this
morning
there
was
an
attraction
for
Lizzie
which
the
Monday
had
wanted
.
<EOS>
She
was
to
meet
her
cousin
,
Frank
Greystock
.
<EOS>
The
journey
was
long
,
and
the
horses
had
gone
on
over
night
.
<EOS>
They
went
by
railway
to
Kilmarnock
,
and
there
a
carriage
from
the
inn
had
been
ordered
to
meet
them
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
,
as
she
heard
the
order
given
,
wondered
whether
she
would
have
to
pay
for
that
,
or
whether
Lord
George
and
Sir
Griffin
would
take
so
much
off
her
shoulders
.
<EOS>
Young
women
generally
pay
for
nothing
;
and
it
was
very
hard
that
she
,
who
was
quite
a
young
woman
,
should
have
to
pay
for
all
.
<EOS>
But
she
smiled
,
and
accepted
the
proposition
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
yes
;
of
course
a
carriage
at
the
station
.
<EOS>
It
is
so
nice
to
have
some
one
to
think
of
things
,
like
Lord
George
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
carriage
met
them
,
and
everything
went
prosperously
.
<EOS>
Almost
the
first
person
they
saw
was
Frank
Greystock
,
in
a
black
coat
,
indeed
,
but
riding
a
superb
grey
horse
,
and
looking
quite
as
though
he
knew
what
he
was
about
.
<EOS>
He
was
introduced
to
Mrs.
Carbuncle
and
Miss
Roanoke
and
Sir
Griffin
.
<EOS>
With
Lord
George
he
had
some
slight
previous
acquaintance
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
've
had
no
difficulty
about
a
horse
?
"
said
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
the
slightest
.
<EOS>
But
I
was
in
an
awful
fright
this
morning
.
<EOS>
I
wrote
to
MacFarlane
from
London
,
and
absolutely
had
n't
a
moment
to
go
to
his
place
yesterday
or
this
morning
.
<EOS>
I
was
staying
over
at
Glenshiels
,
and
had
not
a
moment
to
spare
in
catching
the
train
.
<EOS>
But
I
found
a
horse
-
box
on
,
and
a
lad
from
MacFarlane
's
just
leaving
as
I
came
up
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Did
n't
he
send
a
boy
down
with
the
horse
?
"
asked
Lord
George
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
there
is
a
boy
,
and
the
boy'll
be
awfully
bothered
.
<EOS>
I
told
him
to
book
the
horse
for
Kilmarnock
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
always
do
book
for
Kilmarnock
for
this
meet
,
"
said
a
gentleman
who
had
made
acquaintance
with
some
of
Lizzie
's
party
on
the
previous
hunting
-
day
;
 
"
<EOS>
but
Stewarton
is
ever
so
much
nearer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
So
somebody
told
me
in
the
carriage
,
"
continued
Frank
,
"
and
I
contrived
to
get
my
box
off
at
Stewarton
.
<EOS>
The
guard
was
uncommon
civil
,
and
so
was
the
porter
.
<EOS>
But
I
had
n't
a
moment
to
look
for
the
boy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
always
make
my
fellow
stick
to
his
horses
,
"
said
Sir
Griffin
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
see
,
Sir
Griffin
,
I
have
n't
got
a
fellow
,
and
I
've
only
hired
a
horse
.
<EOS>
But
I
shall
hire
a
good
many
horses
from
Mr.
MacFarlane
if
he
'll
always
put
me
up
like
this
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
so
glad
you
're
here
,
"
said
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
am
I.
<EOS>
I
hunt
about
twice
in
three
years
,
and
no
man
likes
it
so
much
.
<EOS>
I
've
still
got
to
find
out
whether
the
beast
can
jump
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Any
mortal
thing
alive
,
sir
,
"
said
one
of
those
horsey
-
looking
men
who
are
to
be
found
in
all
hunting
-
fields
,
who
wear
old
brown
breeches
,
old
black
coats
,
old
hunting
-
caps
,
who
ride
screws
,
and
never
get
thrown
out
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
him
,
do
you
?
"
said
Frank
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
him
.
<EOS>
I
did
n't
know
as
Muster
MacFarlane
owned
him
.
<EOS>
No
more
he
do
n't
,
"
said
the
horsey
man
,
turning
aside
to
one
of
his
friends
.
<EOS>
"
That
's
Nappie
's
horse
,
from
Jamaica
Street
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
possible
,
"
said
the
friend
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
'll
tell
me
I
do
n't
know
my
own
horse
next
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
believe
you
ever
owned
one
,
"
said
the
friend
.
  
<EOS>
Lizzie
was
in
truth
delighted
to
have
her
cousin
beside
her
.
<EOS>
He
had
,
at
any
rate
,
forgiven
what
she
had
said
to
him
at
his
last
visit
,
or
he
would
not
have
been
there
.
<EOS>
And
then
,
too
,
there
was
a
feeling
of
reality
in
her
connexion
with
him
,
which
was
sadly
wanting
to
her
,
 
unreal
as
she
was
herself
,
 
in
her
acquaintance
with
the
other
people
around
her
.
<EOS>
And
on
this
occasion
three
or
four
people
spoke
or
bowed
to
her
,
who
had
only
stared
at
her
before
;
and
the
huntsman
took
off
his
cap
,
and
hoped
that
he
would
do
something
better
for
her
than
on
the
previous
Monday
.
<EOS>
And
the
huntsman
was
very
courteous
also
to
Miss
Roanoke
,
expressing
the
same
hope
,
cap
in
hand
,
and
smiling
graciously
.
<EOS>
A
huntsman
at
the
beginning
of
any
day
or
at
the
end
of
a
good
day
is
so
different
from
a
huntsman
at
the
end
of
a
bad
day
!
<EOS>
A
huntsman
often
has
a
very
bad
time
out
hunting
,
and
it
is
sometimes
a
marvel
that
he
does
not
take
the
advice
which
Job
got
from
his
wife
.
<EOS>
But
now
all
things
were
smiling
,
and
it
was
soon
known
that
his
lordship
intended
to
draw
Craigattan
Gorse
.
<EOS>
Now
in
those
parts
there
is
no
surer
find
,
and
no
better
chance
of
a
run
,
than
Craigattan
Gorse
affords
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
one
thing
I
want
to
ask
,
Mr.
Greystock
,
"
said
Lord
George
,
in
Lizzie
's
hearing
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
shall
ask
two
,
"
said
Frank
.
  
<EOS>
"
Who
is
to
coach
Lady
Eustace
to
-
day
;
 
you
or
I
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
do
let
me
have
somebody
to
coach
me
,
"
said
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
"
For
devotion
in
coachmanship
,
"
said
Frank
,
 
"
devotion
,
that
is
,
to
my
cousin
,
 
<EOS>
I
defy
the
world
.
<EOS>
In
point
of
skill
I
yield
to
Lord
George
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
pretensions
are
precisely
the
same
,
"
said
Lord
George
.
<EOS>
"
I
glow
with
devotion
;
my
skill
is
naught
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
like
you
best
,
Lord
George
,
"
said
Lizzie
,
laughing
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
settles
the
question
,
"
said
Lord
George
.
  
<EOS>
"
Altogether
,
"
said
Frank
,
taking
off
his
hat
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
mean
as
a
coach
,
"
said
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
quite
understand
the
extent
of
the
preference
,
"
said
Lord
George
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
was
delighted
,
and
thought
the
game
was
worth
the
candle
.
<EOS>
The
noble
master
had
told
her
that
they
were
sure
of
a
run
from
Craigattan
,
and
she
was
n't
in
the
least
tired
,
and
they
were
not
called
upon
to
stand
still
in
a
big
wood
,
and
it
did
n't
rain
,
and
,
in
every
respect
,
the
day
was
very
different
from
Monday
.
<EOS>
Mounted
on
a
bright
-
skinned
,
lively
steed
,
with
her
cousin
on
one
side
and
Lord
George
de
Bruce
Carruthers
on
the
other
,
with
all
the
hunting
world
of
her
own
county
civil
around
her
,
and
a
fox
just
found
in
Craigattan
Gorse
,
what
could
the
heart
of
woman
desire
more
?
<EOS>
This
was
to
live
.
<EOS>
There
was
,
however
,
just
enough
of
fear
to
make
the
blood
run
quickly
to
her
heart
.
<EOS>
"
We
'll
be
away
at
once
now
,
"
said
Lord
George
with
utmost
earnestness
;
"
follow
me
close
,
but
not
too
close
.
<EOS>
When
the
men
see
that
I
am
giving
you
a
lead
,
they
wo
n't
come
between
.
<EOS>
If
you
hang
back
,
I
'll
not
go
ahead
.
<EOS>
Just
check
your
horse
as
he
comes
to
his
fences
,
and
,
if
you
can
,
see
me
over
before
you
go
at
them
.
<EOS>
Now
then
,
down
the
hill
;
 
there
's
a
gate
at
the
corner
,
and
a
bridge
over
the
water
.
<EOS>
We
could
n't
be
better
.
<EOS>
By
George
!
<EOS>
there
they
are
,
 
all
together
.
<EOS>
If
they
do
n't
pull
him
down
in
the
first
two
minutes
,
we
shall
have
a
run
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lizzie
understood
most
of
it
,
 
more
at
least
than
would
nine
out
of
ten
young
women
who
had
never
ridden
a
hunt
before
.
<EOS>
She
was
to
go
wherever
Lord
George
led
her
,
and
she
was
not
to
ride
upon
his
heels
.
<EOS>
So
much
at
least
she
understood
,
 
and
so
much
she
was
resolved
to
do
.
<EOS>
That
dread
about
her
front
teeth
which
had
perplexed
her
on
Monday
was
altogether
gone
now
.
<EOS>
She
would
ride
as
fast
as
Lucinda
Roanoke
.
<EOS>
That
was
her
prevailing
idea
.
<EOS>
Lucinda
,
with
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
Sir
Griffin
,
and
the
ladies
"
groom
,
was
at
the
other
side
of
the
covert
.
<EOS>
Frank
had
been
with
his
cousin
and
Lord
George
,
but
had
crept
down
the
hill
while
the
hounds
were
in
the
gorse
.
<EOS>
A
man
who
likes
hunting
but
hunts
only
once
a
year
is
desirous
of
doing
the
best
he
can
with
his
day
.
<EOS>
When
the
hounds
came
out
and
crossed
the
brook
at
the
end
of
the
gorse
,
perhaps
he
was
a
little
too
forward
.
<EOS>
But
,
indeed
,
the
state
of
affairs
did
not
leave
much
time
for
waiting
,
or
for
the
etiquette
of
the
hunting
-
field
.
<EOS>
Along
the
opposite
margin
of
the
brook
there
ran
a
low
paling
,
which
made
the
water
a
rather
nasty
thing
to
face
.
<EOS>
A
circuit
of
thirty
or
forty
yards
gave
the
easy
riding
of
a
little
bridge
,
and
to
that
all
the
crowd
hurried
.
<EOS>
But
one
or
two
men
with
good
eyes
,
and
hearts
as
good
,
had
seen
the
leading
hounds
across
the
brook
turning
up
the
hill
away
from
the
bridge
,
and
knew
that
two
most
necessary
minutes
might
be
lost
in
the
crowd
.
<EOS>
Frank
did
as
they
did
,
having
seen
nothing
of
any
hounds
,
but
with
instinctive
knowledge
that
they
were
men
likely
to
be
right
in
a
hunting
-
field
.
<EOS>
"
If
that
ai
n't
Nappie
's
horse
,
I
'll
eat
him
,
"
said
one
of
the
leading
men
to
the
other
,
as
all
the
three
were
breasting
the
hill
together
.
<EOS>
Frank
only
knew
that
he
had
been
carried
over
water
and
timber
without
a
mistake
,
and
felt
a
glow
of
gratitude
towards
Mr.
MacFarlane
.
<EOS>
Up
the
hill
they
went
,
and
,
not
waiting
to
inquire
into
the
circumstances
of
a
little
gate
,
jumped
a
four
-
foot
wall
and
were
away
.
<EOS>
"
How
the
mischief
did
he
get
atop
of
Nappie
's
horse
?
"
said
the
horsey
man
to
his
friend
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
're
about
right
for
it
now
,
"
said
the
huntsman
,
as
he
came
up
alongside
of
Frank
.
<EOS>
He
had
crossed
the
bridge
,
but
had
been
the
first
across
it
,
and
knew
how
to
get
over
his
ground
quickly
.
<EOS>
On
they
went
,
the
horsey
man
leading
on
his
thoroughbred
screw
,
the
huntsman
second
,
and
Frank
third
.
<EOS>
The
pace
had
already
been
too
good
for
the
other
horsey
man
.
  
<EOS>
When
Lord
George
and
Lizzie
had
mounted
the
hill
,
there
was
a
rush
of
horses
at
the
little
gate
.
<EOS>
As
they
topped
the
hill
Lucinda
and
Mrs.
Carbuncle
were
jumping
the
wall
.
<EOS>
Lord
George
looked
back
and
asked
a
question
without
a
word
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
answered
it
as
mutely
,
Jump
it
!
<EOS>
She
was
already
a
little
short
of
breath
,
but
she
was
ready
to
jump
anything
that
Lucinda
Roanoke
had
jumped
.
<EOS>
Over
went
Lord
George
,
and
she
followed
him
almost
without
losing
the
stride
of
her
horse
.
<EOS>
Surely
in
all
the
world
there
was
nothing
equal
to
this
!
<EOS>
There
was
a
large
grass
field
before
them
,
and
for
a
moment
she
came
up
alongside
of
Lord
George
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Just
steady
him
before
he
leaps
,
"
said
Lord
George
.
<EOS>
She
nodded
her
assent
,
and
smiled
her
gratitude
.
<EOS>
She
had
plenty
of
breath
for
riding
,
but
none
for
speaking
.
<EOS>
They
were
now
very
near
to
Lucinda
,
and
Sir
Griffin
,
and
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
<EOS>
"
The
pace
is
too
good
for
Mrs.
Carbuncle
's
horse
,
"
said
Lord
George
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
if
she
could
only
pass
them
,
and
get
up
to
those
men
whom
she
saw
before
her
!
<EOS>
She
knew
that
one
of
them
was
her
cousin
Frank
.
<EOS>
She
had
no
wish
to
pass
them
,
but
she
did
wish
that
he
should
see
her
.
<EOS>
In
the
next
fence
Lord
George
spied
a
rail
,
which
he
thought
safer
than
a
blind
hedge
,
and
he
made
for
it
.
<EOS>
His
horse
took
it
well
,
and
so
did
Lizzie
's
;
but
Lizzie
jumped
it
a
little
too
near
him
,
as
he
had
paused
an
instant
to
look
at
the
ground
.
"
<EOS>
Indeed
,
I
wo
n't
do
it
again
,
"
she
said
,
collecting
all
her
breath
for
an
apology
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
going
admirably
,
"
he
said
,
"
and
your
horse
is
worth
double
the
money
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
was
so
glad
now
that
he
had
not
spared
for
price
in
mounting
her
.
<EOS>
Looking
to
the
right
she
could
see
that
Mrs.
Carbuncle
had
only
just
floundered
through
the
hedge
.
<EOS>
Lucinda
was
still
ahead
,
but
Sir
Griffin
was
falling
behind
,
as
though
divided
in
duty
between
the
niece
and
the
aunt
.
<EOS>
Then
they
passed
through
a
gate
,
and
Lord
George
stayed
his
horse
to
hold
it
for
her
.
<EOS>
She
tried
to
thank
him
but
he
stopped
her
.
"
<EOS>
Do
n't
mind
talking
,
but
come
along
;
and
take
it
easy
.
"
<EOS>
She
smiled
again
,
and
he
told
himself
that
she
was
wondrous
pretty
.
<EOS>
And
then
her
pluck
was
so
good
!
<EOS>
And
then
she
had
four
thousand
a
year
!
"
<EOS>
Now
for
the
gap
!
 
<EOS>
do
n't
be
in
a
hurry
.
<EOS>
You
first
,
and
I
'll
follow
you
to
keep
off
these
two
men
.
<EOS>
Keep
to
the
left
,
where
the
other
horses
have
been
.
"
<EOS>
On
they
went
,
and
Lizzie
was
in
heaven
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
quite
understand
her
feelings
,
because
it
had
come
to
that
with
her
that
to
save
her
life
she
could
not
have
spoken
a
word
.
<EOS>
And
yet
she
was
not
only
happy
but
comfortable
.
<EOS>
The
leaping
was
delightful
,
and
her
horse
galloped
with
her
as
though
his
pleasure
was
as
great
as
her
own
.
<EOS>
She
thought
that
she
was
getting
nearer
to
Lucinda
.
<EOS>
For
her
,
in
her
heart
,
Lucinda
was
the
quarry
.
<EOS>
If
she
could
only
pass
Lucinda
!
<EOS>
That
there
were
any
hounds
she
had
altogether
forgotten
.
<EOS>
She
only
knew
that
two
or
three
men
were
leading
the
way
,
of
whom
her
cousin
Frank
was
one
,
that
Lucinda
Roanoke
was
following
them
closely
,
and
that
she
was
gaining
upon
Lucinda
Roanoke
.
<EOS>
She
knew
she
was
gaining
a
little
,
because
she
could
see
now
how
well
and
squarely
Lucinda
sat
upon
her
horse
.
<EOS>
As
for
herself
,
she
feared
that
she
was
rolling
;
 
but
she
need
not
have
feared
.
<EOS>
She
was
so
small
,
and
lithe
,
and
light
,
that
her
body
adapted
itself
naturally
to
the
pace
of
her
horse
.
<EOS>
Lucinda
was
of
a
different
build
,
and
it
behoved
her
to
make
for
herself
a
perfect
seat
.
<EOS>
"
We
must
have
the
wall
,
"
said
Lord
George
,
who
was
again
at
her
side
for
a
moment
.
<EOS>
She
would
have
"
had
"
a
castle
wall
,
moat
included
,
turrets
and
all
,
if
he
would
only
have
shown
her
the
way
.
<EOS>
The
huntsman
and
Frank
had
taken
the
wall
.
<EOS>
The
horsey
man
's
bit
of
blood
,
knowing
his
own
powers
to
an
inch
,
had
declined
,
 
not
roughly
,
with
a
sudden
stop
and
a
jerk
,
but
with
a
swerve
to
the
left
which
the
horsey
man
at
once
understood
.
<EOS>
What
the
brute
lacked
in
jumping
he
could
make
up
in
pace
,
and
the
horsey
man
was
along
the
wall
and
over
a
broken
bank
at
the
head
of
it
,
with
the
loss
of
not
more
than
a
minute
.
<EOS>
Lucinda
's
horse
,
following
the
ill
example
,
balked
the
jump
.
<EOS>
She
turned
him
round
with
a
savage
gleam
in
her
eye
which
Lizzie
was
just
near
enough
to
see
,
struck
him
rapidly
over
the
shoulders
with
her
whip
,
and
the
animal
flew
with
her
into
the
next
field
.
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
if
I
could
do
it
like
that
!
"
thought
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
But
in
that
very
minute
she
was
doing
it
,
not
only
as
well
but
better
.
<EOS>
Not
following
Lord
George
,
but
close
at
his
side
,
the
little
animal
changed
his
pace
,
trotted
for
a
yard
or
two
,
hopped
up
as
though
the
wall
were
nothing
,
knocked
off
a
top
stone
with
his
hind
feet
,
and
dropped
onto
the
ground
so
softly
that
Lizzie
hardly
believed
that
she
had
gone
over
the
big
obstruction
that
had
cost
Lucinda
such
an
effort
.
<EOS>
Lucinda
's
horse
came
down
on
all
four
legs
,
with
a
grunt
and
a
groan
,
and
she
knew
that
she
had
bustled
him
.
<EOS>
At
that
moment
Lucinda
was
very
full
of
wrath
against
the
horsey
man
with
the
screw
who
had
been
in
her
way
.
"
<EOS>
He
touched
it
,
"
gasped
Lizzie
,
thinking
that
her
horse
had
disgraced
himself
.
"
<EOS>
He
's
worth
his
weight
in
gold
,
"
said
Lord
George
.
<EOS>
"
Come
along
.
<EOS>
There
's
a
brook
with
a
ford
.
<EOS>
Morgan
is
in
it
.
"
<EOS>
Morgan
was
the
huntsman
.
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
let
them
get
before
you
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
no
.
<EOS>
She
would
let
no
one
get
before
her
.
<EOS>
She
did
her
very
best
,
and
just
got
her
horse
's
nose
on
the
broken
track
leading
down
into
the
brook
before
Lucinda
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Pretty
good
,
is
n't
it
?
"
said
Lucinda
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
smiled
sweetly
.
<EOS>
She
could
smile
,
though
she
could
not
speak
.
"
<EOS>
Only
they
do
balk
one
so
at
one
's
fences
!
"
said
Lucinda
.
<EOS>
The
horsey
man
had
all
but
regained
his
place
,
and
was
immediately
behind
Lucinda
,
within
hearing
 
as
Lucinda
knew
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
further
side
of
the
field
,
beyond
the
brook
,
there
was
a
little
spinny
,
and
for
half
a
minute
the
hounds
came
to
a
check
.
<EOS>
"
Give
"
em
time
,
sir
,
give
"
em
time
,
"
said
Morgan
to
Frank
,
speaking
in
full
good
humour
,
with
no
touch
of
Monday
's
savagery
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Wind
him
,
Bolton
;
Beaver
's
got
it
.
<EOS>
Very
good
thing
,
my
lady
,
is
n't
it
?
<EOS>
Now
,
Carstairs
,
if
you
're
a
-
going
to
"
unt
the
fox
,
you
'd
better
<EOS>
"
unt
him
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Carstairs
was
the
horsey
man
,
 
and
one
with
whom
Morgan
very
often
quarrelled
.
<EOS>
"
That
's
it
,
my
hearties
,
"
and
Morgan
was
across
a
broken
wall
in
a
moment
,
after
the
leading
hounds
.
<EOS>
"
Are
we
to
go
on
?
"
said
Lizzie
,
who
feared
much
that
Lucinda
would
get
ahead
of
her
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
matter
of
three
dozen
horsemen
up
now
,
and
,
as
far
as
Lizzie
saw
,
the
whole
thing
might
have
to
be
done
again
.
<EOS>
In
hunting
,
to
have
ridden
is
the
pleasure
;
 
and
not
simply
to
have
ridden
well
,
but
to
have
ridden
better
than
others
.
<EOS>
"
I
call
it
very
awkward
ground
,
"
said
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
coming
up
.
<EOS>
"
It
ca
n't
be
compared
to
the
Baron
's
country
.
"
<EOS>
"
Stone
walls
four
feet
and
a
half
high
,
and
well
built
,
are
awkward
,
"
said
the
noble
master
.
  
<EOS>
But
the
hounds
were
away
again
,
and
Lizzie
had
got
across
the
gap
before
Lucinda
,
who
,
indeed
,
made
way
for
her
hostess
with
a
haughty
politeness
which
was
not
lost
upon
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
could
not
stop
to
beg
pardon
,
but
she
would
remember
to
do
it
in
her
prettiest
way
on
their
journey
home
.
<EOS>
They
were
now
on
a
track
of
open
country
,
and
the
pace
was
quicker
even
than
before
.
<EOS>
The
same
three
men
were
still
leading
,
Morgan
,
Greystock
,
and
Carstairs
.
<EOS>
Carstairs
had
slightly
the
best
of
it
;
and
of
course
Morgan
swore
afterwards
that
he
was
among
the
hounds
the
whole
run
.
<EOS>
"
The
scent
was
that
good
,
there
was
n't
no
putting
of
"
em
off
;
 
no
thanks
to
him
,
"
said
Morgan
.
<EOS>
"
I
"
ate
to
see
'em
galloping
,
galloping
,
galloping
,
with
no
more
eye
to
the
"
ounds
than
a
pig
.
<EOS>
Any
idiot
can
gallop
,
if
he
's
got
it
under
"
i
m
.
<EOS>
"
All
which
only
signified
that
Jack
Morgan
did
n't
like
to
see
any
of
his
field
before
him
.
<EOS>
There
was
need
,
indeed
,
now
for
galloping
,
and
it
may
be
doubted
whether
Morgan
himself
was
not
doing
his
best
.
<EOS>
There
were
about
five
or
six
in
the
second
flight
,
and
among
these
Lord
George
and
Lizzie
were
well
placed
.
<EOS>
But
Lucinda
had
pressed
again
ahead
.
"
<EOS>
Miss
Roanoke
had
better
have
a
care
,
or
she
'll
blow
her
horse
,
"
Lord
George
said
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
did
n't
mind
what
happened
to
Miss
Roanoke
's
horse
,
so
that
it
could
be
made
to
go
a
little
slower
and
fall
behind
.
<EOS>
But
Lucinda
still
pressed
on
,
and
her
animal
went
with
a
longer
stride
than
Lizzie
's
horse
.
  
<EOS>
They
now
crossed
a
road
,
descending
a
hill
,
and
were
again
in
a
close
country
.
<EOS>
A
few
low
hedges
seemed
as
nothing
to
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
She
could
see
her
cousin
gallop
over
them
ahead
of
her
,
as
though
they
were
nothing
;
and
her
own
horse
,
as
he
came
to
them
,
seemed
to
do
exactly
the
same
.
<EOS>
On
a
sudden
they
found
themselves
abreast
with
the
huntsman
.
<EOS>
"
There
's
a
biggish
brook
below
there
,
my
lord
,
"
said
he
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
was
charmed
to
hear
it
.
<EOS>
Hitherto
she
had
jumped
all
the
big
things
so
easily
,
that
it
was
a
pleasure
to
hear
of
them
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
How
are
we
to
manage
it
?
"
asked
Lord
George
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
rideable
,
my
lord
;
but
there
's
a
place
about
half
a
mile
down
.
<EOS>
Let
's
see
how
'll
they
head
.
<EOS>
Drat
it
,
my
lord
,
they
've
turned
up
,
and
we
must
have
it
or
go
back
to
the
road
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Morgan
hurried
on
,
showing
that
he
meant
to
"
have
"
it
,
as
did
also
Lucinda
.
"
<EOS>
Shall
we
go
to
the
road
?
"
said
Lord
George
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
no
!
"
said
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
Lord
George
looked
at
her
and
at
her
horse
,
and
then
galloped
after
the
huntsman
and
Lucinda
.
<EOS>
The
horsey
man
with
the
well
-
bred
screw
was
first
over
the
brook
.
<EOS>
The
little
animal
could
take
almost
any
amount
of
water
,
and
his
rider
knew
the
spot
.
"
<EOS>
He
'll
do
it
like
a
bird
,
"
he
had
said
to
Greystock
,
and
Greystock
had
followed
him
.
<EOS>
Mr.
MacFarlane
's
hired
horse
did
do
it
like
a
bird
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
him
,
sir
,
"
said
Carstairs
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Nappie
gave
£
250
for
him
down
in
Northamptonshire
last
February
;
 
bought
him
of
Mr.
Percival
.
<EOS>
You
know
Mr.
Percival
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Frank
knew
neither
Mr.
Percival
nor
Mr.
Nappie
,
and
at
this
moment
cared
nothing
for
either
of
them
.
<EOS>
To
him
,
at
this
moment
,
Mr.
MacFarlane
,
of
Buchanan
Street
,
Glasgow
,
was
the
best
friend
he
ever
had
.
  
<EOS>
Morgan
,
knowing
well
the
horse
he
rode
,
dropped
him
into
the
brook
,
floundered
and
half
swam
through
the
mud
and
water
,
and
scrambled
out
safely
on
the
other
side
.
"
<EOS>
He
would
n't
have
jumped
it
with
me
,
if
I
'd
asked
him
ever
so
,
"
he
said
afterwards
.
<EOS>
Lucinda
rode
at
it
,
straight
as
an
arrow
,
but
her
brute
came
to
a
dead
balk
,
and
,
but
that
she
sat
well
,
would
have
thrown
her
into
the
stream
.
<EOS>
Lord
George
let
Lizzie
take
the
leap
before
he
took
it
,
knowing
that
,
if
there
were
misfortune
,
he
might
so
best
render
help
.
<EOS>
To
Lizzie
it
seemed
as
though
the
river
were
the
blackest
,
and
the
deepest
,
and
the
broadest
that
ever
ran
.
<EOS>
For
a
moment
her
heart
quailed
;
 
but
it
was
but
for
a
moment
.
<EOS>
She
shut
her
eyes
,
and
gave
the
little
horse
his
head
.
<EOS>
For
a
moment
she
thought
that
she
was
in
the
water
.
<EOS>
Her
horse
was
almost
upright
on
the
bank
,
with
his
hind
-
feet
down
among
the
broken
ground
,
and
she
was
clinging
to
his
neck
.
<EOS>
But
she
was
light
,
and
the
beast
made
good
his
footing
,
and
then
she
knew
that
she
had
done
it
.
<EOS>
In
that
moment
of
the
scramble
her
heart
had
been
so
near
her
mouth
that
she
was
almost
choked
.
<EOS>
When
she
looked
round
,
Lord
George
was
already
by
her
side
.
<EOS>
"
You
hardly
gave
him
powder
enough
,
"
he
said
,
"
but
still
he
did
it
beautifully
.
<EOS>
Good
heavens
!
<EOS>
Miss
Roanoke
is
in
the
river
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Lizzie
looked
back
,
and
there
,
in
truth
,
was
Lucinda
struggling
with
her
horse
in
the
water
.
<EOS>
They
paused
a
moment
,
and
then
there
were
three
or
four
men
assisting
her
.
"
<EOS>
Come
on
,
"
said
Lord
George
;
 
<EOS>
"
there
are
plenty
to
take
her
out
,
and
we
could
n't
get
to
her
if
we
stayed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
ought
to
stop
,
"
said
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
could
n't
get
back
if
you
gave
your
eyes
for
it
,
"
said
Lord
George
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
's
all
right
.
"
<EOS>
So
instigated
,
Lizzie
followed
her
leader
up
the
hill
,
and
in
a
minute
was
close
upon
Morgan
's
heels
.
  
<EOS>
The
worst
of
doing
a
big
thing
out
hunting
is
the
fact
that
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
they
who
do
n't
do
it
are
as
well
off
as
they
who
do
.
<EOS>
If
there
were
any
penalty
for
riding
round
,
or
any
mark
given
to
those
who
had
ridden
straight
,
 
so
that
justice
might
in
some
sort
be
done
,
 
it
would
perhaps
be
better
.
<EOS>
When
you
have
nearly
broken
your
neck
to
get
to
hounds
,
or
made
your
horse
exert
himself
beyond
his
proper
power
,
and
then
find
yourself
,
within
three
minutes
,
overtaking
the
hindmost
ruck
of
horsemen
on
a
road
because
of
some
iniquitous
turn
that
the
fox
has
taken
,
the
feeling
is
not
pleasant
.
<EOS>
And
some
man
who
has
not
ridden
at
all
,
who
never
did
ride
at
all
,
will
ask
you
where
you
have
been
;
and
his
smile
will
give
you
the
lie
in
your
teeth
if
you
make
any
attempt
to
explain
the
facts
.
<EOS>
Let
it
be
sufficient
for
you
at
such
a
moment
to
feel
that
you
are
not
ashamed
of
yourself
.
<EOS>
Self
-
respect
will
support
a
man
even
in
such
misery
as
this
.
  
<EOS>
The
fox
on
this
occasion
,
having
crossed
the
river
,
had
not
left
its
bank
,
but
had
turned
from
his
course
up
the
stream
,
so
that
the
leading
spirits
who
had
followed
the
hounds
over
the
water
came
upon
a
crowd
of
riders
on
the
road
in
a
space
something
short
of
a
mile
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
among
others
,
was
there
,
and
had
heard
of
Lucinda
's
mishap
.
<EOS>
She
said
a
word
to
Lord
George
in
anger
,
and
Lord
George
answered
her
.
<EOS>
"
We
were
over
the
river
before
it
happened
,
and
if
we
had
given
our
eyes
we
could
n't
have
got
to
her
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
make
a
fool
of
yourself
!
"
<EOS>
The
last
words
were
spoken
in
a
whisper
,
but
Lizzie
's
sharp
ears
caught
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
obliged
to
do
what
I
was
told
,
"
said
Lizzie
apologetically
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
will
be
all
right
,
dear
Lady
Eustace
.
<EOS>
Sir
Griffin
is
with
her
.
<EOS>
I
am
so
glad
you
are
going
so
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
They
were
off
again
now
,
and
the
stupid
fox
absolutely
went
back
across
the
river
.
<EOS>
But
,
whether
on
one
side
or
on
the
other
,
his
struggle
for
life
was
now
in
vain
.
<EOS>
Two
years
of
happy
,
free
existence
amidst
the
wilds
of
Craigattan
had
been
allowed
him
.
<EOS>
Twice
previously
had
he
been
"
found
,
"
and
the
kindly
storm
or
not
less
beneficent
brightness
of
the
sun
had
enabled
him
to
baffle
his
pursuers
.
<EOS>
Now
there
had
come
one
glorious
day
,
and
the
common
lot
of
mortals
must
be
his
.
<EOS>
A
little
spurt
there
was
,
back
towards
his
own
home
,
 
just
enough
to
give
something
of
selectness
to
the
few
who
saw
him
fall
,
 
<EOS>
and
then
he
fell
.
<EOS>
Among
the
few
were
Frank
,
and
Lord
George
,
and
our
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
Morgan
was
there
,
of
course
,
and
one
of
his
whips
.
<EOS>
Of
Ayrshire
folk
,
perhaps
five
or
six
,
and
among
them
our
friend
Mr.
Carstairs
.
<EOS>
They
had
run
him
down
close
to
the
outbuildings
of
a
farm
-
yard
,
and
they
broke
him
up
in
the
home
paddock
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
think
of
hunting
?
"
said
Frank
to
his
cousin
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
divine
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
cousin
went
pretty
well
<EOS>
,
I
think
,
"
he
said
to
Lord
George
.
  
<EOS>
"
Like
a
celestial
bird
of
Paradise
.
<EOS>
No
one
ever
went
better
;
 
or
I
believe
so
well
.
<EOS>
You
've
been
carried
rather
nicely
yourself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
I
have
,
"
said
Frank
,
patting
his
still
palpitating
horse
,
"
and
he
's
not
to
say
tired
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
've
taken
it
pretty
well
out
of
him
,
sir
,
"
said
Carstairs
.
<EOS>
"
There
was
a
little
bit
of
hill
that
told
when
we
got
over
the
brook
.
<EOS>
I
<EOS>
know'd
<EOS>
you
'd
find
he
'd
jump
a
bit
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
whether
he
's
to
be
bought
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Frank
in
his
enthusiasm
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
the
horse
that
is
n't
,
"
said
Mr.
Carstairs
,
 
"
so
long
as
you
do
n't
stand
at
the
figure
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
They
were
collected
on
the
farm
road
,
and
now
,
as
they
were
speaking
,
there
was
a
commotion
among
the
horses
.
<EOS>
A
man
,
driving
a
little
buggy
,
was
forcing
his
way
along
the
road
,
and
there
was
a
sound
of
voices
,
as
though
the
man
in
the
buggy
were
angry
.
<EOS>
And
he
was
very
angry
.
<EOS>
Frank
,
who
was
on
foot
by
his
horse
's
head
,
could
see
that
the
man
was
dressed
for
hunting
,
with
a
bright
red
coat
and
a
flat
hat
,
and
that
he
was
driving
the
pony
with
a
hunting
-
whip
.
<EOS>
The
man
was
talking
as
he
approached
,
but
what
he
said
did
not
much
matter
to
Frank
.
<EOS>
It
did
not
much
matter
to
Frank
till
his
new
friend
,
Mr.
Carstairs
,
whispered
a
word
in
his
ear
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
Nappie
,
by
gum
!
"
<EOS>
Then
there
crept
across
Frank
's
mind
an
idea
that
there
might
be
trouble
coming
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
he
is
,
"
said
Nappie
,
bringing
his
pony
to
a
dead
stop
with
a
chuck
,
and
jumping
out
of
the
buggy
.
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
you
,
sir
;
you
've
stole
my
"
orse
!
"
<EOS>
Frank
said
not
a
word
,
but
stood
his
ground
with
his
hand
on
the
nag
's
bridle
.
<EOS>
"
You
've
stole
my
"
orse
;
you
've
stole
him
off
the
rail
.
<EOS>
And
you
've
been
a
-
riding
him
all
day
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
you
"
ave
.
<EOS>
Did
ever
anybody
see
the
like
of
this
?
<EOS>
Why
,
the
poor
beast
ca
n't
a'most
stand
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
got
him
from
Mr.
MacFarlane
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
MacFarlane
be
blowed
!
<EOS>
You
did
n't
do
nothing
of
the
kind
.
<EOS>
You
stole
him
off
the
rail
at
Stewarton
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
you
did
;
 
and
him
booked
to
Kilmarnock
.
<EOS>
Where
's
a
police
?
<EOS>
Who
's
to
stand
the
like
o
'
this
?
<EOS>
I
say
,
my
lord
,
 
just
look
at
this
.
"
<EOS>
A
crowd
had
now
been
formed
round
poor
Frank
,
and
the
master
had
come
up
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Nappie
was
a
Huddersfield
man
,
who
had
come
to
Glasgow
in
the
course
of
the
last
winter
,
and
whose
popularity
in
the
hunting
-
field
was
not
as
yet
quite
so
great
as
it
perhaps
might
have
been
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
been
a
mistake
,
I
suppose
,
"
said
the
master
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mistake
,
my
lord
!
<EOS>
Take
a
man
's
"
orse
off
the
rail
at
Stewarton
,
and
him
booked
to
Kilmarnock
,
and
ride
him
to
a
standstill
!
<EOS>
It
's
no
mistake
at
all
.
<EOS>
It
's
"
orse
-
nobbling
;
that
's
what
it
is
.
<EOS>
Is
there
any
police
here
,
sir
?
"
<EOS>
This
he
said
,
turning
round
to
a
farmer
.
<EOS>
The
farmer
did
n't
deign
any
reply
.
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
you
'll
tell
me
your
name
,
sir
?
<EOS>
if
you
've
got
a
name
.
<EOS>
No
gen'leman
ever
took
a
gen'leman
's
"
orse
off
the
rail
like
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Frank
,
do
come
away
,
"
said
Lizzie
,
who
was
standing
by
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
shall
be
all
right
in
two
minutes
,
"
said
Frank
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
we
sha'n't
,
"
said
Mr.
Nappie
,
 
"
nor
yet
in
two
hours
.
<EOS>
I
've
asked
what
's
your
name
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
name
is
 
Greystock
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Greystockings
,
"
said
Mr.
Nappie
more
angrily
than
ever
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
believe
in
no
such
name
.
<EOS>
Where
do
you
live
?
<EOS>
"
Then
somebody
whispered
a
word
to
him
.
"
<EOS>
Member
of
Parliament
,
 
is
he
?
<EOS>
I
do
n't
care
a
 
---
.
<EOS>
A
member
of
Parliament
is
n't
to
steal
my
"
orse
off
the
rail
,
and
him
booked
to
Kilmarnock
.
<EOS>
Now
,
my
lord
,
what
'd
you
do
if
you
was
served
like
that
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
This
was
another
appeal
to
the
noble
master
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
express
a
hope
that
my
horse
had
carried
the
gentleman
as
he
liked
to
be
carried
,
"
said
the
master
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
he
has
,
 
carried
me
remarkably
well
,
"
said
Frank
;
 
<EOS>
whereupon
there
was
a
loud
laugh
among
the
crowd
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
he
'd
broken
the
infernal
neck
of
you
,
you
scoundrel
,
you
,
 
<EOS>
that
's
what
I
do
!
"
said
Mr.
Nappie
.
<EOS>
"
There
was
my
man
,
and
my
"
orse
,
and
myself
all
booked
from
Glasgow
to
Kilmarnock
;
 
and
when
I
got
there
what
did
the
guard
say
to
me
?
 
<EOS>
why
,
just
that
a
man
in
a
black
coat
had
taken
my
horse
off
at
Stewarton
;
and
now
I
've
been
driving
all
about
the
country
in
that
gig
there
for
three
hours
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
When
Mr.
Nappie
had
got
so
far
as
this
in
his
explanation
he
was
almost
in
tears
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
make
"
i
m
pay
,
that
I
will
.
<EOS>
Take
your
hand
off
my
horse
's
bridle
,
sir
.
<EOS>
Is
there
any
gentleman
here
as
would
like
to
give
two
hundred
and
eighty
guineas
for
a
horse
,
and
then
have
him
rid
to
a
standstill
by
a
fellow
like
that
down
from
London
?
<EOS>
If
you
're
in
Parliament
,
why
do
n't
you
stick
to
Parliament
?
<EOS>
I
do
n't
suppose
he
's
worth
fifty
pound
this
moment
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Frank
had
all
the
while
been
endeavouring
to
explain
the
accident
;
how
he
had
ordered
a
horse
from
Mr.
MacFarlane
,
and
the
rest
of
it
,
 
as
the
reader
will
understand
;
but
quite
in
vain
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Nappie
in
his
wrath
would
not
hear
a
word
.
<EOS>
But
now
that
he
spoke
about
money
,
Frank
thought
that
he
saw
an
opening
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Nappie
,
"
he
said
,
"
I
'll
buy
the
horse
for
the
price
you
gave
for
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
see
you
 
---
;
extremely
well
 
---
first
,
"
said
Mr.
Nappie
.
  
<EOS>
The
horse
had
now
been
surrendered
to
Mr.
Nappie
,
and
Frank
suggested
that
he
might
as
well
return
to
Kilmarnock
in
the
gig
,
and
pay
for
the
hire
of
it
.
<EOS>
But
Mr.
Nappie
would
not
allow
him
to
set
a
foot
upon
the
gig
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
my
gig
for
the
day
,
"
said
he
,
"
and
you
do
n't
touch
it
.
<EOS>
You
shall
foot
it
all
the
way
back
to
Kilmarnock
,
Mr.
Greystockings
.
"
<EOS>
But
Mr.
Nappie
,
in
making
this
threat
,
forgot
that
there
were
gentlemen
there
with
second
horses
.
<EOS>
Frank
was
soon
mounted
on
one
belonging
to
Lord
George
,
and
Lord
George
's
servant
,
at
the
corner
of
the
farm
-
yard
,
got
into
the
buggy
,
and
was
driven
back
to
Kilmarnock
by
the
man
who
had
accompanied
poor
Mr.
Nappie
in
their
morning
's
hunt
on
wheels
after
the
hounds
.
  
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
word
,
I
was
very
sorry
,
"
said
Frank
as
he
rode
back
with
his
friends
to
Kilmarnock
;
"
and
when
I
first
really
understood
what
had
happened
,
I
would
have
done
anything
.
<EOS>
But
what
could
I
say
?
<EOS>
It
was
impossible
not
to
laugh
,
he
was
so
unreasonable
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
have
put
my
whip
over
his
shoulder
,
"
said
a
stout
farmer
,
meaning
to
be
civil
to
Frank
Greystock
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
after
using
it
so
often
over
his
horse
,
"
said
Lord
George
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
had
to
touch
him
once
,
"
said
Frank
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
are
you
to
have
it
all
for
nothing
?
"
asked
the
thoughtful
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
'll
send
a
bill
in
,
you
'll
find
,
"
said
a
bystander
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
he
,
"
said
Lord
George
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
His
grievance
is
worth
more
to
him
than
his
money
.
"
  
<EOS>
No
bill
did
come
to
Frank
,
and
he
got
his
mount
for
nothing
.
<EOS>
When
Mr.
MacFarlane
was
applied
to
,
he
declared
that
no
letter
ordering
a
horse
had
been
delivered
in
his
establishment
.
<EOS>
From
that
day
to
this
Mr.
Nappie
's
grey
horse
has
had
a
great
character
in
Ayrshire
;
but
all
the
world
there
says
that
its
owner
never
rides
him
as
Frank
Greystock
rode
him
that
day
.
     
<EOS>
Sir
Griffin
Takes
an
Unfair
Advantage
 
<EOS>
We
must
return
to
the
unfortunate
Lucinda
,
whom
we
last
saw
struggling
with
her
steed
in
the
black
waters
of
the
brook
which
she
attempted
to
jump
.
<EOS>
A
couple
of
men
were
soon
in
after
her
,
and
she
was
rescued
and
brought
back
to
the
side
from
which
she
had
taken
off
without
any
great
difficulty
.
<EOS>
She
was
neither
hurt
nor
frightened
,
but
she
was
wet
through
;
and
for
a
while
she
was
very
unhappy
,
because
it
was
not
found
quite
easy
to
extricate
her
horse
.
<EOS>
During
the
ten
minutes
of
her
agony
,
while
the
poor
brute
was
floundering
in
the
mud
,
she
had
been
quite
disregardful
of
herself
,
and
had
almost
seemed
to
think
that
Sir
Griffin
,
who
was
with
her
,
should
go
into
the
water
after
her
steed
.
<EOS>
But
there
were
already
two
men
in
the
water
,
and
three
on
the
bank
,
and
Sir
Griffin
thought
that
duty
required
him
to
stay
by
the
young
lady
's
side
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
care
a
bit
about
myself
,
"
said
Lucinda
,
"
but
if
anything
can
be
done
for
poor
Warrior
!
"
<EOS>
Sir
Griffin
assured
her
that
"
poor
Warrior
"
was
receiving
the
very
best
attention
;
and
then
he
pressed
upon
her
the
dangerous
condition
in
which
she
herself
was
standing
,
 
quite
wet
through
,
covered
,
as
to
her
feet
and
legs
,
with
mud
,
growing
colder
and
colder
every
minute
.
<EOS>
She
touched
her
lips
with
a
little
brandy
that
somebody
gave
her
,
and
then
declared
again
that
she
cared
for
nothing
but
poor
Warrior
.
<EOS>
At
last
poor
Warrior
was
on
his
legs
,
with
the
water
dripping
from
his
black
flanks
,
with
his
nose
stained
with
mud
,
with
one
of
his
legs
a
little
cut
,
 
and
,
alas
!
<EOS>
with
the
saddle
wet
through
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
better
than
to
ride
into
Kilmarnock
.
<EOS>
The
whole
party
must
return
to
Kilmarnock
,
and
,
perhaps
,
if
they
hurried
,
she
might
be
able
to
get
her
clothes
dry
before
they
would
start
by
the
train
.
<EOS>
Sir
Griffin
,
of
course
,
accompanied
her
,
and
they
two
rode
into
the
town
alone
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
did
hear
of
the
accident
soon
after
the
occurrence
,
but
had
not
seen
her
niece
;
nor
when
she
heard
of
it
,
could
she
have
joined
Lucinda
.
  
<EOS>
If
anything
would
make
a
girl
talk
to
a
man
,
such
a
ducking
as
Lucinda
had
had
would
do
so
.
<EOS>
Such
sudden
events
,
when
they
come
in
the
shape
of
misfortune
,
or
the
reverse
,
generally
have
the
effect
of
abolishing
shyness
for
the
time
.
<EOS>
Let
a
girl
be
upset
with
you
in
a
railway
train
,
and
she
will
talk
like
a
Rosalind
,
though
before
the
accident
she
was
as
mute
as
death
.
<EOS>
But
with
Lucinda
Roanoke
the
accustomed
change
did
not
seem
to
take
place
.
<EOS>
When
Sir
Griffin
had
placed
her
on
her
saddle
,
she
would
have
trotted
all
the
way
into
Kilmarnock
without
a
word
if
he
would
have
allowed
her
.
<EOS>
But
he
,
at
least
,
understood
that
such
a
joint
misfortune
should
create
confidence
,
 
for
he
,
too
,
had
lost
the
run
,
and
he
did
not
intend
to
lose
his
opportunity
also
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
so
glad
that
I
was
near
you
,
"
he
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
thank
you
,
yes
;
it
would
have
been
bad
to
be
alone
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
mean
that
I
am
glad
that
it
was
I
,
"
said
Sir
Griffin
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
very
hard
even
to
get
a
moment
to
speak
to
you
.
<EOS>
"
They
were
now
trotting
along
on
the
road
,
and
there
were
still
three
miles
before
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
,
"
said
she
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
always
with
the
other
people
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Just
so
.
"
And
then
he
paused
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
want
to
find
you
when
you
're
not
with
the
other
people
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
,
however
,
you
do
n't
like
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
As
he
paused
for
a
reply
,
she
felt
herself
bound
to
say
something
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
yes
,
I
do
,
"
she
said
,
 
"
as
well
as
anybody
else
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
is
that
all
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
so
.
"
  
<EOS>
After
that
he
rode
on
for
the
best
part
of
another
mile
before
he
spoke
to
her
again
.
<EOS>
He
had
made
up
his
mind
that
he
would
do
it
.
<EOS>
He
hardly
knew
why
it
was
that
he
wanted
her
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
determined
that
he
was
desirous
of
the
charms
or
comfort
of
domestic
life
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
even
thought
where
he
would
live
were
he
married
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
suggested
to
himself
that
Lucinda
was
a
desirable
companion
,
that
her
temper
would
suit
his
,
that
her
ways
and
his
were
sympathetic
,
or
that
she
would
be
a
good
mother
to
the
future
Sir
Griffin
Trewett
.
<EOS>
He
had
seen
that
she
was
a
very
handsome
girl
,
and
therefore
he
had
thought
that
he
would
like
to
possess
her
.
<EOS>
Had
she
fallen
like
a
ripe
plum
into
his
mouth
,
or
shown
herself
ready
so
to
fall
,
he
would
probably
have
closed
his
lips
and
backed
out
of
the
affair
.
<EOS>
But
the
difficulty
no
doubt
added
something
to
the
desire
.
<EOS>
"
I
had
hoped
,
"
he
said
,
"
that
after
knowing
each
other
so
long
there
might
have
been
more
than
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
was
again
driven
to
speak
because
he
paused
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
that
that
makes
much
difference
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Roanoke
,
you
ca
n't
but
understand
what
I
mean
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
sure
I
do
n't
,
"
said
she
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
I
'll
speak
plainer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
now
,
Sir
Griffin
,
because
I
'm
so
wet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
can
listen
to
me
even
if
you
will
not
answer
me
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
that
you
know
that
I
love
you
better
than
all
the
world
.
<EOS>
Will
you
be
mine
?
"
<EOS>
Then
he
moved
on
a
little
forward
so
that
he
might
look
back
into
her
face
.
<EOS>
"
Will
you
allow
me
to
think
of
you
as
my
future
wife
?
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Roanoke
was
able
to
ride
at
a
stone
wall
or
at
a
river
,
and
to
ride
at
either
the
second
time
when
her
horse
balked
the
first
.
<EOS>
Her
heart
was
big
enough
for
that
.
<EOS>
But
her
heart
was
not
big
enough
to
enable
her
to
give
Sir
Griffin
an
answer
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
it
was
that
,
in
regard
to
the
river
and
the
stone
wall
,
she
knew
what
she
wanted
;
but
that
,
as
to
Sir
Griffin
,
she
did
not
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
this
is
a
proper
time
to
ask
,
"
she
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Because
I
am
wet
through
and
cold
.
<EOS>
It
is
taking
an
unfair
advantage
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
mean
to
take
any
unfair
advantage
,
"
said
Sir
Griffin
scowling
 
<EOS>
"
I
thought
we
were
alone
 
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Sir
Griffin
,
I
am
so
tired
!
"
<EOS>
As
they
were
now
entering
Kilmarnock
,
it
was
quite
clear
he
could
press
her
no
further
.
<EOS>
They
clattered
up
,
therefore
,
to
the
hotel
,
and
he
busied
himself
in
getting
a
bedroom
fire
lighted
,
and
in
obtaining
the
services
of
the
landlady
.
<EOS>
A
cup
of
tea
was
ordered
,
and
toast
,
and
in
two
minutes
Lucinda
Roanoke
was
relieved
from
the
presence
of
the
baronet
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
kind
of
thing
a
fellow
does
n't
quite
understand
,
"
said
Sir
Griffin
to
himself
.
<EOS>
"
Of
course
she
means
it
,
and
why
the
devil
ca
n't
she
say
so
?
"
<EOS>
He
had
no
idea
of
giving
up
the
chase
,
but
he
thought
that
perhaps
he
would
take
it
out
of
her
when
she
became
Lady
Tewett
.
  
<EOS>
They
were
an
hour
at
the
inn
before
Mrs.
Carbuncle
and
Lady
Eustace
arrived
,
and
during
that
hour
Sir
Griffin
did
not
see
Miss
Roanoke
.
<EOS>
For
this
there
was
,
of
course
,
ample
reason
.
<EOS>
Under
the
custody
of
the
landlady
,
Miss
Roanoke
was
being
made
dry
and
clean
,
and
was
by
no
means
in
a
condition
to
receive
a
lover
's
vows
.
<EOS>
The
baronet
sent
up
half
-
a
-
dozen
messages
as
he
sauntered
about
the
yard
of
the
inn
,
but
he
got
no
message
in
return
.
<EOS>
Lucinda
,
as
she
sat
drinking
her
tea
and
drying
her
clothes
,
did
no
doubt
think
about
him
,
 
<EOS>
but
she
thought
about
him
as
little
as
she
could
.
<EOS>
Of
course
,
he
would
come
again
,
and
she
could
make
up
her
mind
then
.
<EOS>
It
was
no
doubt
necessary
that
she
should
do
something
.
<EOS>
Her
fortune
,
such
as
it
was
,
would
soon
be
spent
in
the
adventure
of
finding
a
husband
.
<EOS>
She
also
had
her
ideas
about
love
,
and
had
enough
of
sincerity
about
her
to
love
a
man
thoroughly
;
but
it
had
seemed
to
her
that
all
the
men
who
came
near
her
were
men
whom
she
could
not
fail
to
dislike
.
<EOS>
She
was
hurried
here
and
hurried
there
,
and
knew
nothing
of
real
social
intimacies
.
<EOS>
As
she
told
her
aunt
in
her
wickedness
,
she
would
almost
have
preferred
a
shoemaker
,
 
if
she
could
have
become
acquainted
with
a
shoemaker
in
a
manner
that
should
be
unforced
and
genuine
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
savageness
of
antipathy
in
her
to
the
mode
of
life
which
her
circumstances
had
produced
for
her
.
<EOS>
It
was
that
very
savageness
which
made
her
ride
so
hard
,
and
which
forbade
her
to
smile
and
be
pleasant
to
people
whom
she
could
not
like
.
<EOS>
And
yet
she
knew
that
something
must
be
done
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
afford
to
wait
as
other
girls
might
do
.
<EOS>
Why
not
Sir
Griffin
as
well
as
any
other
fool
?
<EOS>
It
may
be
doubted
whether
she
knew
how
obstinate
,
how
hard
,
how
cruel
to
a
woman
a
fool
can
be
.
  
<EOS>
Her
stockings
had
been
washed
and
dried
,
and
her
boots
and
trousers
were
nearly
dry
,
when
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
followed
by
Lizzie
,
rushed
into
the
room
.
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
my
darling
,
how
are
you
?
"
said
the
aunt
,
seizing
her
niece
in
her
arms
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
only
dirty
now
,
"
said
Lucinda
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
've
got
off
the
biggest
of
the
muck
,
my
lady
,
"
said
the
landlady
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Miss
Roanoke
,
"
said
Lizzie
,
"
I
hope
you
do
n't
think
I
behaved
badly
in
going
on
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Everybody
always
goes
on
,
of
course
,
"
said
Lucinda
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
so
pray
Lord
George
to
let
me
try
and
jump
back
to
you
.
<EOS>
We
were
over
,
you
know
,
before
it
happened
.
<EOS>
But
he
said
it
was
quite
impossible
.
<EOS>
We
did
wait
till
we
saw
you
were
out
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
did
n't
signify
at
all
,
Lady
Eustace
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
was
so
sorry
<EOS>
when
I
went
through
the
wall
at
the
corner
of
the
wood
before
you
.
<EOS>
But
I
was
so
excited
I
hardly
knew
what
I
was
doing
.
"
<EOS>
Lucinda
,
who
was
quite
used
to
these
affairs
in
the
hunting
-
field
,
simply
nodded
her
acceptance
of
this
apology
.
<EOS>
"
But
it
was
a
glorious
run
;
was
n't
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Pretty
well
,
"
said
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
it
was
glorious
,
 
but
then
I
got
over
the
river
.
<EOS>
And
oh
,
if
you
had
been
there
afterwards
.
<EOS>
There
was
such
an
adventure
between
a
man
in
a
gig
and
my
cousin
Frank
.
"
<EOS>
Then
they
all
went
to
the
train
,
and
were
carried
home
to
Portray
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
Are
Not
Angry
?
"
 
<EOS>
On
their
journey
back
to
Portray
,
the
ladies
were
almost
too
tired
for
talking
;
and
Sir
Griffin
was
sulky
.
<EOS>
Sir
Griffin
had
as
yet
heard
nothing
about
Greystock
's
adventure
,
and
did
not
care
to
be
told
.
<EOS>
But
when
once
they
were
at
the
castle
,
and
had
taken
warm
baths
,
and
glasses
of
sherry
,
and
got
themselves
dressed
and
had
come
down
to
dinner
,
they
were
all
very
happy
.
<EOS>
To
Lizzie
it
had
certainly
been
the
most
triumphant
day
of
her
life
.
<EOS>
Her
marriage
with
Sir
Florian
had
been
triumphant
,
but
that
was
only
a
step
to
something
good
that
was
to
come
after
.
<EOS>
She
then
had
at
her
own
disposal
her
little
wits
and
her
prettiness
,
and
a
world
before
her
<EOS>
in
which
,
as
it
then
seemed
to
her
,
there
was
a
deal
of
pleasure
if
she
could
only
reach
it
.
<EOS>
Up
to
this
period
of
her
career
she
had
hardly
reached
any
pleasure
;
but
this
day
had
been
very
pleasant
.
<EOS>
Lord
George
de
Bruce
Carruthers
had
in
truth
been
her
Corsair
,
and
she
had
found
the
thing
which
she
liked
to
do
,
and
would
soon
know
how
to
do
.
<EOS>
How
glorious
it
was
to
jump
over
that
black
,
yawning
stream
,
and
then
to
see
Lucinda
fall
into
it
!
<EOS>
And
she
could
remember
every
jump
,
and
her
feeling
of
ecstasy
as
she
landed
on
the
right
side
.
<EOS>
And
she
had
by
heart
every
kind
word
that
Lord
George
had
said
to
her
,
 
<EOS>
and
she
loved
the
sweet
,
pleasant
,
Corsair
-
like
intimacy
that
had
sprung
up
between
them
.
<EOS>
She
wondered
whether
Frank
was
at
all
jealous
.
<EOS>
It
would
n't
be
amiss
that
he
should
be
a
little
jealous
.
<EOS>
And
then
somebody
had
brought
home
in
his
pocket
the
fox
's
brush
,
which
the
master
of
the
hounds
had
told
the
huntsman
to
give
her
.
<EOS>
It
was
all
delightful
;
 
and
so
much
more
delightful
because
Mrs.
Carbuncle
had
not
gone
quite
so
well
as
she
liked
to
go
,
and
because
Lucinda
had
fallen
into
the
water
.
  
<EOS>
They
did
not
dine
till
past
eight
,
and
the
ladies
and
gentlemen
all
left
the
room
together
.
<EOS>
Coffee
and
liqueurs
were
to
be
brought
into
the
drawing
-
room
,
and
they
were
all
to
be
intimate
,
comfortable
,
and
at
their
ease
;
 
all
except
Sir
Griffin
Tewett
,
who
was
still
very
sulky
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Did
he
say
anything
?
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
had
asked
.
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
"
<EOS>
"
Well
?
"
<EOS>
"
He
proposed
;
but
of
course
I
could
not
answer
him
when
I
was
wet
through
.
<EOS>
"
There
had
been
but
a
moment
,
and
in
that
moment
this
was
all
that
Lucinda
would
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
I
do
n't
mean
to
stir
again
,
"
said
Lizzie
,
throwing
herself
into
a
corner
of
a
sofa
,
"
till
somebody
carries
me
to
bed
.
<EOS>
I
never
was
so
tired
in
all
my
life
.
<EOS>
"
She
was
tired
,
but
there
is
a
fatigue
which
is
delightful
as
long
as
all
the
surroundings
are
pleasant
and
comfortable
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
call
it
a
very
hard
day
,
"
said
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
only
killed
one
fox
,
"
said
Mr.
Emilius
,
pretending
a
delightfully
clerical
ignorance
,
"
and
on
Monday
you
killed
four
.
<EOS>
Why
should
you
be
tired
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
it
was
nearly
twenty
miles
,
"
said
Frank
,
who
was
also
ignorant
.
  
<EOS>
"
About
ten
,
perhaps
,
"
said
Lord
George
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
an
hour
and
forty
minutes
,
and
there
was
a
good
bit
of
slow
hunting
after
we
had
come
back
over
the
river
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
sure
it
was
thirty
,
"
said
Lizzie
,
forgetting
her
fatigue
in
her
energy
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ten
is
always
better
than
twenty
,
"
said
Lord
George
,
"
and
five
generally
better
than
ten
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
just
whatever
is
best
,
"
said
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
Frank
's
friend
,
Mr.
Nappie
,
said
it
was
twenty
.
<EOS>
By
-
the
-
bye
,
Frank
,
ought
n't
we
to
have
asked
Mr.
Nappie
home
to
dinner
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
thought
so
,
"
said
Frank
;
"
but
I
could
n't
take
the
liberty
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
really
think
poor
Mr.
Nappie
was
very
badly
used
,
"
said
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
he
was
,
"
said
Lord
George
;
 
"
no
man
ever
worse
since
hunting
was
invented
.
<EOS>
He
was
entitled
to
a
dozen
dinners
and
no
end
of
patronage
;
but
you
see
he
took
it
out
in
calling
your
cousin
Mr.
Greystockings
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
felt
that
blow
,
"
said
Frank
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
always
call
you
Cousin
Greystockings
,
"
said
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
hard
,
"
continued
Lord
George
,
"
and
I
understood
it
all
so
well
when
he
got
into
a
mess
in
his
wrath
about
booking
the
horse
to
Kilmarnock
.
<EOS>
If
the
horse
had
been
on
the
roadside
,
he
or
his
men
could
have
protected
him
.
<EOS>
He
is
put
under
the
protection
of
a
whole
railway
company
,
and
the
company
gives
him
up
to
the
first
fellow
that
comes
and
asks
for
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
cruel
,
"
said
Frank
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
it
had
happened
to
me
,
I
should
have
been
very
angry
,
"
said
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
Frank
would
n't
have
had
a
horse
at
all
,
"
said
Lizzie
,
"
unless
he
had
taken
Mr.
Nappie
's
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Lord
George
still
continued
his
plea
for
Mr.
Nappie
.
<EOS>
"
There
's
something
in
that
,
certainly
;
but
,
still
,
I
agree
with
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
<EOS>
If
it
had
happened
to
me
,
I
should
 
just
have
committed
murder
and
suicide
.
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
conceive
anything
so
terrible
.
<EOS>
It
's
all
very
well
for
your
noble
master
to
talk
of
being
civil
,
and
hoping
that
the
horse
had
carried
him
well
,
and
all
that
.
<EOS>
There
are
circumstances
in
which
a
man
ca
n't
be
civil
.
<EOS>
And
then
everybody
laughed
at
him
!
<EOS>
It
's
the
way
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
The
lower
you
fall
,
the
more
you
're
kicked
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
can
I
do
for
him
?
"
asked
Frank
.
  
<EOS>
"
Put
him
down
at
your
club
,
and
order
thirty
dozen
of
grey
shirtings
from
Nappie
and
Co.
,
without
naming
the
price
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
'd
send
you
grey
stockings
instead
,
"
said
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
But
though
Lizzie
was
in
heaven
,
it
behoved
her
to
be
careful
.
<EOS>
The
Corsair
was
a
very
fine
specimen
of
the
Corsair
breed
;
 
about
the
best
Corsair
she
had
ever
seen
,
and
had
been
devoted
to
her
for
the
day
.
<EOS>
But
these
Corsairs
are
known
to
be
dangerous
,
and
it
would
not
be
wise
that
she
should
sacrifice
any
future
prospect
of
importance
on
behalf
of
a
feeling
,
which
,
no
doubt
,
was
founded
on
poetry
,
but
which
might
too
probably
have
no
possible
beneficial
result
.
<EOS>
As
far
as
she
knew
,
the
Corsair
had
not
even
an
island
of
his
own
in
the
Ægean
Sea
.
<EOS>
And
,
if
he
had
,
might
not
the
island
too
probably
have
a
Medora
or
two
of
its
own
?
<EOS>
In
a
ride
across
the
country
the
Corsair
was
all
that
a
Corsair
should
be
;
but
knowing
,
as
she
did
,
but
very
little
of
the
Corsair
,
she
could
not
afford
to
throw
over
her
cousin
for
his
sake
.
<EOS>
As
she
was
leaving
the
drawing
-
room
,
she
managed
to
say
one
word
to
her
cousin
.
<EOS>
"
You
were
not
angry
with
me
because
I
got
Lord
George
to
ride
with
me
instead
of
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Angry
with
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
knew
I
should
only
be
a
hindrance
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
a
matter
of
course
.
<EOS>
He
knows
all
about
it
,
and
I
know
nothing
.
<EOS>
I
am
very
glad
that
you
liked
it
so
much
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
like
it
;
 
and
so
did
you
.
<EOS>
I
was
so
glad
you
got
that
poor
man
's
horse
.
<EOS>
You
were
not
angry
then
?
<EOS>
"
They
had
now
passed
across
the
hall
,
and
were
on
the
bottom
stair
.
  
<EOS>
"
Certainly
not
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
are
not
angry
for
what
happened
before
?
<EOS>
"
She
did
not
look
into
his
face
as
she
asked
this
question
,
but
stood
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
the

Then
she
went
,
and
he
returned
to
a
room
below
which
had
been
prepared
for
purposes
of
tobacco
and
soda
-
water
and
brandy
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
Griff
,
you
're
rather
out
of
sorts
to
-
night
,
"
said
Lord
George
to
his
friend
,
before
Frank
had
joined
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
would
you
be
out
of
sorts
if
you
'd
lost
your
run
and
had
to
pick
a
young
woman
out
of
the
water
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
like
young
women
when
they
're
damp
and
smell
of
mud

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
mean
to
marry
her
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
How
would
you
like
me
to
ask
you
questions
?
<EOS>
Do
you
mean
to
marry
the
widow
?
<EOS>
And
,
if
you
do
,
what
'll
Mrs.
Carbuncle
say
?
<EOS>
And
if
you
do
n't
,
what
do
you
mean
to
do
;
and
all
the
rest
of
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
As
for
marrying
the
widow
,
I
should
like
to
know
the
facts
first
.
<EOS>
As
to
Mrs.
C.
,
she
would
n't
object
in
the
least
.
<EOS>
I
generally
have
my
horses
so
bitted
that
they
ca
n't
very
well
object
.
<EOS>
And
as
to
the
other
question
,
I
mean
to
stay
here
for
the
next
fortnight
,
and
I
advise
you
to
make
it
square
with
Miss
Roanoke
.
<EOS>
Here
's
my
lady
's
cousin
;
for
a
man
who
does
n't
ride
often
,
he
went
very
well
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
if
he
'd
take
a
twenty
-
pound
note
if
I
sent
it
to
him
,
"
said
Frank
,
when
they
broke
up
for
the
night
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
like
the
idea
of
riding
such
a
fellow
's
horse
for
nothing
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
'll
bring
an
action
against
the
railway
,
and
then
you
can
offer
to
pay
if
you
like
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Nappie
did
bring
an
action
against
the
railway
,
claiming
exorbitant
damages
;
 
but
with
what
result
,
we
need
not
trouble
ourselves
to
inquire
.
   
<EOS>
"
Likewise

Frank
Greystock
stayed
till
the
following
Monday
at
Portray
,
but
could
not
be
induced
to
hunt
on
the
Saturday
,
 
on
which
day
the
other
sporting
men
and
women
went
to
the
meet
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
,
he
said
,
trust
to
that
traitor
MacFarlane
,
and
he
feared
that
his
friend
Mr.
Nappie
would
not
give
him
another
mount
on
the
grey
horse
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
offered
him
one
of
her
two
darlings
,
 
an
offer
which
he
,
of
course
,
refused
;
and
Lord
George
also
proposed
to
put
him
up
.
<EOS>
But
Frank
averred
that
he
had
ridden
his
hunt
for
that
season
,
and
would
not
jeopardise
the
laurels
he
had
gained
.
"
<EOS>
And
,
moreover
,
"
said
he
,
"
I
should
not
dare
to
meet
Mr.
Nappie
in
the
field
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
So
he
remained
at
the
castle
and
took
a
walk
with
Mr.
Emilius
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Emilius
asked
a
good
many
questions
about
Portray
,
and
exhibited
the
warmest
sympathy
with
Lizzie
's
widowed
condition
.
<EOS>
He
called
her
a
"
sweet
,
gay
,
unsophisticated
,
light
-
hearted
young
thing
.
"
<EOS>
"
She
is
very
young
,
"
replied
her
cousin
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
"
he
continued
,
in
answer
to
further
questions
;
"
Portray
is
certainly
very
nice
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
what
the
income
is
.
<EOS>
Well
;
yes
.
<EOS>
I
should
think
it
is
over
a
thousand
.
<EOS>
Eight
!
<EOS>
No
,
I
never
heard
it
said
that
it
was
as
much
as
that
.
<EOS>
"
When
Mr.
Emilius
put
it
down
in
his
mind
as
five
,
he
was
not
void
of
acuteness
,
as
very
little
information
had
been
given
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
joke
throughout
the
castle
that
Mr.
Emilius
had
fallen
in
love
with
Miss
Macnulty
.
<EOS>
They
had
been
a
great
deal
together
on
those
hunting
days
;
and
Miss
Macnulty
was
unusually
enthusiastic
in
praise
of
his
manner
and
conversation
.
<EOS>
To
her
,
also
,
had
been
addressed
questions
as
to
Portray
and
its
income
,
all
of
which
she
had
answered
to
the
best
of
her
ability
;
 
not
intending
to
betray
any
secret
,
for
she
had
no
secret
to
betray
;
but
giving
ordinary
information
on
that
commonest
of
all
subjects
,
our
friends
"
incomes
.
<EOS>
Then
there
had
risen
a
question
whether
there
was
a
vacancy
for
such
promotion
to
Miss
Macnulty
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
had
certainly
heard
that
there
was
a
Mrs.
Emilius
.
<EOS>
Lucinda
was
sure
that
there
was
not
,
 
an
assurance
which
might
have
been
derived
from
a
certain
eagerness
in
the
reverend
gentleman
's
demeanour
to
herself
on
a
former
occasion
.
<EOS>
To
Lizzie
,
who
at
present
was
very
good
-
natured
,
the
idea
of
Miss
Macnulty
having
a
lover
,
whether
he
were
a
married
man
or
not
,
was
very
delightful
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
sure
I
do
n't
know
what
you
mean
,
"
said
Miss
Macnulty
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
suppose
Mr.
Emilius
had
any
idea
of
the
kind
.
"
<EOS>
Upon
the
whole
,
however
,
Miss
Macnulty
liked
it
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
Saturday
nothing
especial
happened
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Nappie
was
out
on
his
grey
horse
,
and
condescended
to
a
little
conversation
with
Lord
George
.
<EOS>
He
would
n't
have
minded
,
he
said
,
if
Mr.
Greystock
had
come
forward
;
but
he
did
think
Mr.
Greystock
had
n't
come
forward
as
he
ought
to
have
done
.
<EOS>
Lord
George
professed
that
he
had
observed
the
same
thing
;
but
then
,
as
he
whispered
into
Mr.
Nappie
's
ear
,
Mr.
Greystock
was
particularly
known
as
a
bashful
man
.
"
<EOS>
He
did
n't
ride
my
"
orse
anyway
bashful
,
"
said
Mr.
Nappie
;
 
<EOS>
all
of
which
was
told
at
dinner
in
the
evening
,
amidst
a
great
deal
of
laughter
.
<EOS>
There
had
been
nothing
special
in
the
way
of
sport
,
and
Lizzie
's
enthusiasm
for
hunting
,
though
still
high
,
had
gone
down
a
few
degrees
below
fever
heat
.
<EOS>
Lord
George
had
again
coached
her
;
but
there
had
been
no
great
need
for
coaching
,
no
losing
of
her
breath
,
no
cutting
down
of
Lucinda
,
no
river
,
no
big
wall
,
 
nothing
,
in
short
,
very
fast
.
<EOS>
They
had
been
much
in
a
big
wood
;
but
Lizzie
,
in
giving
an
account
of
the
day
to
her
cousin
,
had
acknowledged
that
she
had
not
quite
understood
what
they
were
doing
at
any
time
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
a
blowing
of
horns
and
a
galloping
up
and
down
all
the
day
,
"
she
said
;
"
and
then
Morgan
got
cross
again
and
scolded
all
the
people
.
<EOS>
But
there
was
one
nice
paling
,
and
Dandy
flew
over
it
beautifully
.
<EOS>
Two
men
tumbled
down
,
and
one
of
them
was
a
good
deal
hurt
.
<EOS>
It
was
very
jolly
;
 
but
not
at
all
like
Wednesday
.
"
  
<EOS>
Nor
had
it
been
like
Wednesday
to
Lucinda
Roanoke
,
who
did
not
fall
into
the
water
,
and
who
did
accept
Sir
Griffin
when
he
again
proposed
to
her
in
Sarkie
wood
.
<EOS>
A
great
deal
had
been
said
to
Lucinda
on
the
Thursday
and
the
Friday
by
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
 
which
had
not
been
taken
at
all
in
good
part
by
Lucinda
.
<EOS>
On
those
days
Lucinda
kept
as
much
as
she
could
out
of
Sir
Griffin
's
way
,
and
almost
snapped
at
the
baronet
when
he
spoke
to
her
.
<EOS>
Sir
Griffin
swore
to
himself
that
he
was
n't
going
to
be
treated
that
way
.
<EOS>
He
'd
have
her
,
by
George
!
<EOS>
There
are
men
in
whose
love
a
good
deal
of
hatred
is
mixed
;
 
who
love
as
the
huntsman
loves
the
fox
,
towards
the
killing
of
which
he
intends
to
use
all
his
energies
and
intellects
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
who
did
not
quite
understand
the
sort
of
persistency
by
which
a
Sir
Griffin
can
be
possessed
,
feared
greatly
that
Lucinda
was
about
to
lose
her
prize
,
and
spoke
out
accordingly
.
"
<EOS>
Will
you
,
then
,
just
have
the
kindness
to
tell
me
what
it
is
you
propose
to
yourself
?
"
asked
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
propose
anything
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
where
will
you
go
when
your
money
's
done
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Just
where
I
am
going
now
!
"
said
Lucinda
.
<EOS>
By
which
it
may
be
feared
that
she
indicated
a
place
to
which
she
should
not
on
such
an
occasion
have
made
an
allusion
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
like
anybody
else
?
"
suggested
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
like
anybody
or
anything
,
"
said
Lucinda
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
you
do
;
 
you
like
horses
to
ride
,
and
dresses
to
wear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
do
n't
.
<EOS>
I
like
hunting
because
,
perhaps
,
some
day
I
may
break
my
neck
.
<EOS>
It
's
no
use
your
looking
like
that
,
Aunt
Jane
.
<EOS>
I
know
what
it
all
means
.
<EOS>
If
I
could
break
my
neck
it
would
be
the
best
thing
for
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
'll
break
my
heart
,
Lucinda
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Mine
's
broken
long
ago
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
If
you
'll
accept
Sir
Griffin
,
and
just
get
a
home
round
yourself
,
you
'll
find
that
everything
will
be
happy
.
<EOS>
It
all
comes
from
the
dreadful
uncertainty
.
<EOS>
Do
you
think
I
have
suffered
nothing
?
<EOS>
Carbuncle
is
always
threatening
that
he
'll
go
back
to
New
York
,
and
as
for
Lord
George
,
he
treats
me
that
way
<EOS>
I
'm
sometimes
afraid
to
show
my
face
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
should
you
care
for
Lord
George
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
all
very
well
to
say
,
why
should
I
care
for
him
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
care
for
him
,
only
one
does
n't
want
to
quarrel
with
one
's
friends
.
<EOS>
Carbuncle
says
he
owes
him
money
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
believe
it
,
"
said
Lucinda
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
he
says
Carbuncle
owes
him
money
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
believe
that
,
"
said
Lucinda
.
  
<EOS>
"
Between
it
all
,
I
do
n't
know
which
way
to
be
turning
.
<EOS>
And
now
,
when
there
's
this
great
opening
for
you
,
you
wo
n't
know
your
own
mind
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
my
mind
well
enough
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
you
'll
never
have
such
another
chance
.
<EOS>
Good
looks
is
n't
everything
.
<EOS>
You
've
never
a
word
to
say
to
anybody
;
and
when
a
man
does
come
near
you
,
you
're
as
savage
and
cross
as
a
bear
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Go
on
,
Aunt
Jane
.
"
  
"
What
with
your
hatings
and
dislikings
,
one
would
suppose
you
did
n't
think
God
Almighty
made
men
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
made
some
of
"
em
very
bad
,
"
said
Lucinda
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
for
some
others
,
they
're
only
half
made
.
<EOS>
What
can
Sir
Griffin
do
,
do
you
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
He
's
a
gentleman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
if
I
were
a
man
,
I
should
wish
not
to
be
a
gentleman
;
that
's
all
.
<EOS>
I
'd
a
deal
<EOS>
sooner
marry
a
man
like
that
huntsman
,
who
has
something
to
do
and
knows
how
to
do
it
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Again
she
said
,
"
Do
n't
worry
any
more
,
Aunt
Jane
.
<EOS>
It
does
n't
do
any
good
.
<EOS>
It
seems
to
me
that
to
make
myself
Sir
Griffin
's
wife
would
be
impossible
;
but
I
'm
sure
your
talking
wo
n't
do
it
.
"
<EOS>
Then
her
aunt
left
her
,
and
,
having
met
Lord
George
,
at
his
bidding
went
and
made
civil
speeches
to
Lizzie
Eustace
.
  
<EOS>
That
was
on
the
Friday
afternoon
.
<EOS>
On
the
Saturday
afternoon
Sir
Griffin
,
biding
his
time
,
found
himself
,
in
a
ride
with
Lucinda
,
sufficiently
far
from
other
horsemen
for
his
purpose
.
<EOS>
He
was
n't
going
to
stand
any
more
nonsense
.
<EOS>
He
was
entitled
to
an
answer
,
and
he
knew
that
he
was
entitled
,
by
his
rank
and
position
,
to
a
favourable
answer
.
<EOS>
Here
was
a
girl
who
,
as
far
as
he
knew
,
was
without
a
shilling
,
of
whose
birth
and
parentage
nobody
knew
anything
,
who
had
nothing
but
her
beauty
to
recommend
her
,
 
nothing
but
that
and
a
certain
capacity
for
carrying
herself
in
the
world
as
he
thought
ladies
should
carry
themselves
,
 
and
<EOS>
she
was
to
give
herself
airs
with
him
,
and
expect
him
to
propose
to
her
half
a
dozen
times
!
<EOS>
By
George
!
 
<EOS>
he
had
a
very
good
mind
to
go
away
and
let
her
find
out
her
mistake
.
<EOS>
And
he
would
have
done
so
,
 
only
that
he
was
a
man
who
always
liked
to
have
all
that
he
wanted
.
<EOS>
It
was
intolerable
to
him
that
anybody
should
refuse
him
anything
.
"
<EOS>
Miss
Roanoke
,
"
he
said
;
and
then
he
paused
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
Griffin
,
"
said
Lucinda
,
bowing
her
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
you
will
condescend
to
remember
what
I
had
the
honour
of
saying
to
you
as
we
rode
into
Kilmarnock
last
Wednesday
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
had
just
been
dragged
out
of
a
river
,
Sir
Griffin
,
and
I
do
n't
think
any
girl
ought
to
be
asked
to
remember
what
was
said
to
her
in
that
condition
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
say
it
again
now
,
will
you
remember
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
promise
,
Sir
Griffin
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
give
me
an
answer
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
must
depend
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Come
;
 
I
will
have
an
answer
.
<EOS>
When
a
man
tells
a
lady
that
he
admires
her
,
and
asks
her
to
be
his
wife
,
he
has
a
right
to
an
answer
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
think
that
in
such
circumstances
a
man
has
a
right
to
expect
an
answer
?
"
  
<EOS>
Lucinda
hesitated
for
a
moment
,
and
he
was
beginning
again
to
remonstrate
impatiently
,
when
she
altered
her
tone
,
and
replied
to
him
seriously
,
"
In
such
circumstances
a
gentleman
has
a
right
to
expect
an
answer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
give
me
one
.
<EOS>
I
admire
you
above
all
the
world
,
and
I
ask
you
to
be
my
wife
.
<EOS>
I
'm
quite
in
earnest
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
that
you
are
in
earnest
,
Sir
Griffin
.
<EOS>
I
would
do
neither
you
nor
myself
the
wrong
of
supposing
that
it
could
be
otherwise
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
well
then
.
<EOS>
Will
you
accept
the
offer
that
I
make
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
Again
she
paused
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
a
right
to
an
answer
,
 
of
course
;
but
it
may
be
so
difficult
to
give
it
.
<EOS>
It
seems
to
me
that
you
have
hardly
realised
how
serious
a
question
it
is
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Have
n't
I
,
though
!
<EOS>
By
George
,
it
is
serious
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Will
it
not
be
better
for
you
to
think
it
over
again
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
now
hesitated
for
a
moment
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
it
might
be
better
.
<EOS>
Should
she
take
him
at
his
word
there
would
be
no
going
back
from
it
.
<EOS>
But
Lord
George
knew
that
he
had
proposed
before
.
<EOS>
Lord
George
had
learned
this
from
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
and
had
shown
that
he
knew
it
.
<EOS>
And
then
,
too
,
 
he
had
made
up
his
mind
about
it
.
<EOS>
He
wanted
her
,
and
he
meant
to
have
her
.
"
<EOS>
It
requires
no
more
thinking
with
me
,
Lucinda
.
<EOS>
I
'm
not
a
man
who
does
things
without
thinking
;
and
when
I
have
thought
I
do
n't
want
to
think
again
.
<EOS>
There
's
my
hand
;
 
will
you
have
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
,
"
said
Lucinda
,
putting
her
hand
into
his
.
<EOS>
He
no
sooner
felt
her
assurance
than
his
mind
misgave
him
that
he
had
been
precipitate
,
that
he
had
been
rash
,
and
that
she
had
taken
advantage
of
him
.
<EOS>
After
all
,
how
many
things
are
there
in
the
world
more
precious
than
a
handsome
girl
.
<EOS>
And
she
had
never
told
him
that
she
loved
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
you
love
me
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
H'sh
!
 
<EOS>
here
they
all
are
.
<EOS>
"
The
hand
was
withdrawn
,
but
not
before
both
Mrs.
Carbuncle
and
Lady
Eustace
had
seen
it
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
in
her
great
anxiety
,
bided
her
time
,
keeping
close
to
her
niece
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
she
felt
that
if
the
two
were
engaged
,
it
might
be
well
to
keep
the
lovers
separated
for
awhile
,
lest
they
should
quarrel
before
the
engagement
should
have
been
so
confirmed
by
the
authority
of
friends
as
to
be
beyond
the
power
of
easy
annihilation
.
<EOS>
Lucinda
rode
quite
demurely
with
the
crowd
.
<EOS>
Sir
Griffin
remained
near
her
,
but
without
speaking
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
whispered
to
Lord
George
that
there
had
been
a
proposal
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
sat
in
stately
dignity
on
her
horse
,
as
though
there
were
nothing
which
at
that
moment
especially
engaged
her
attention
.
<EOS>
An
hour
almost
had
passed
before
she
was
able
to
ask
the
important
question
,
"
<EOS>
Well
;
 
what
have
you
said
to
him
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
;
 
just
what
you
would
have
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
accepted
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
I
was
obliged
.
<EOS>
At
any
rate
I
did
.
<EOS>
You
shall
know
one
thing
,
Aunt
Jane
,
at
any
rate
,
and
I
hope
it
will
make
you
comfortable
.
<EOS>
I
hate
a
good
many
people
;
but
of
all
the
people
in
the
world
<EOS>
I
hate
Sir
Griffin
Tewett
the
worst
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nonsense
,
Lucinda
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
shall
be
nonsense
,
if
you
please
;
but
it
's
true
.
<EOS>
I
shall
have
to
lie
to
him
,
 
but
there
shall
be
no
lying
to
you
,
<EOS>
however
much
you
may
wish
it
.
<EOS>
I
hate
him
!
"
  
<EOS>
This
was
very
grim
,
but
Mrs.
Carbuncle
quite
understood
that
to
persons
situated
in
great
difficulty
things
might
be
grim
.
<EOS>
A
certain
amount
of
grimness
must
be
endured
.
<EOS>
And
she
knew
,
too
,
that
Lucinda
was
not
a
girl
to
be
driven
without
showing
something
of
an
intractable
spirit
in
harness
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
had
undertaken
the
driving
of
Lucinda
,
and
had
been
not
altogether
unsuccessful
.
<EOS>
The
thing
so
necessary
to
be
done
was
now
effected
.
<EOS>
Her
niece
was
engaged
to
a
man
with
a
title
,
to
a
man
reported
to
have
a
fortune
,
to
a
man
of
family
,
and
a
man
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
Now
that
the
engagement
was
made
,
the
girl
could
not
go
back
from
it
,
and
it
was
for
Mrs.
Carbuncle
to
see
that
neither
should
Sir
Griffin
go
back
.
<EOS>
Her
first
steps
must
be
taken
at
once
.
<EOS>
The
engagement
should
be
made
known
to
all
the
party
,
and
should
be
recognised
by
some
word
spoken
between
herself
and
the
lover
.
<EOS>
The
word
between
herself
and
the
lover
must
be
the
first
thing
.
<EOS>
She
herself
,
personally
,
was
not
very
fond
of
Sir
Griffin
;
but
on
such
an
occasion
as
this
she
could
smile
and
endure
the
bear
.
<EOS>
Sir
Griffin
was
a
bear
,
 
but
so
also
was
Lucinda
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
rabbits
and
hares
All
go
in
pairs
;
And
likewise
the
bears
In
couples
agree
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
consoled
herself
with
the
song
,
and
assured
herself
that
it
would
all
come
right
.
<EOS>
No
doubt
the
she
-
bears
were
not
as
civil
to
the
he
-
bears
as
the
turtle
doves
are
to
each
other
.
<EOS>
It
was
,
perhaps
,
her
misfortune
that
her
niece
was
not
a
turtle
dove
;
but
,
such
as
she
was
,
the
best
had
been
done
for
her
.
"
<EOS>
Dear
Sir
Griffin
,
"
she
said
on
the
first
available
opportunity
,
not
caring
much
for
the
crowd
,
and
almost
desirous
that
her
very
words
should
be
overheard
,
"
my
darling
girl
has
made
me
so
happy
by
what
she
has
told
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
has
n't
lost
any
time
,
"
said
Sir
Griffin
.
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
she
would
lose
no
time
.
<EOS>
She
is
the
same
to
me
as
a
daughter
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
child
of
my
own
,
and
she
is
everything
to
me
.
<EOS>
May
I
tell
you
that
you
are
the
luckiest
man
in
Europe
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
n't
every
girl
that
would
suit
me
,
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
of
that
.
<EOS>
I
have
noticed
how
particular
you
are
.
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
say
a
word
of
Lucinda
's
beauty
.
<EOS>
Men
are
better
judges
of
that
than
women
;
but
for
high
,
chivalrous
spirit
,
for
true
principle
and
nobility
,
and
what
I
call
downright
worth
,
I
do
n't
think
you
will
easily
find
her
superior
.
<EOS>
And
she
is
as
true
as
steel
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
about
as
hard
,
I
was
beginning
to
think
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
girl
like
that
,
Sir
Griffin
,
does
not
give
herself
away
easily
.
<EOS>
You
will
not
like
her
the
less
for
that
now
that
you
are
the
possessor
.
<EOS>
She
is
very
young
,
and
has
known
my
wish
that
she
should
not
engage
herself
to
any
one
quite
yet
.
<EOS>
But
,
as
it
is
,
I
can
not
regret
anything
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
daresay
not
,
"
said
Sir
Griffin
.
  
<EOS>
That
the
man
was
a
bear
<EOS>
was
a
matter
of
course
,
and
bears
probably
do
not
themselves
know
how
bearish
they
are
.
<EOS>
Sir
Griffin
,
no
doubt
,
was
unaware
of
the
extent
of
his
own
rudeness
.
<EOS>
And
his
rudeness
mattered
but
little
to
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
so
long
as
he
acknowledged
the
engagement
.
<EOS>
She
had
not
expected
a
lover
's
raptures
from
the
one
more
than
from
the
other
.
<EOS>
And
was
not
there
enough
in
the
engagement
to
satisfy
her
?
<EOS>
She
allowed
,
therefore
,
no
cloud
to
cross
her
brow
as
she
rode
up
alongside
of
Lord
George
.
"
<EOS>
Sir
Griffin
has
proposed
,
and
she
has
accepted
him
,
"
she
said
in
a
whisper
.
<EOS>
She
was
not
now
desirous
that
any
one
should
hear
her
but
he
to
whom
she
spoke
.
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
she
has
,
"
said
Lord
George
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
about
that
,
George
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
I
thought
she
would
,
and
sometimes
that
she
would
n't
.
<EOS>
You
have
never
understood
Lucinda
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
Griff
will
understand
her
,
 
<EOS>
that
's
all
.
<EOS>
And
now
that
the
thing
is
settled
,
you
'll
not
trouble
me
about
it
any
more
.
<EOS>
Their
woes
be
on
their
own
head
.
<EOS>
If
they
come
to
blows
Lucinda
will
thrash
him
,
I
do
n't
doubt
.
<EOS>
But
while
it
's
simply
a
matter
of
temper
and
words
,
she
wo
n't
find
Tewett
so
easy
-
going
as
he
looks
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
they
'll
do
very
well
together
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
they
will
.
<EOS>
There
's
no
saying
who
may
do
well
together
.
<EOS>
You
and
Carbuncle
get
on
à
merveille
.
<EOS>
When
is
it
to
be
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
nothing
is
settled
yet
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
n't
be
too
hard
about
settlements
,
or
,
maybe
,
he
'll
find
a
way
of
wriggling
out
.
<EOS>
When
a
girl
without
a
shilling
asks
very
much
,
the
world
supports
a
man
for
breaking
his
engagement
.
<EOS>
Let
her
pretend
to
be
indifferent
about
it
;
 
that
will
be
the
way
to
keep
him
firm
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
his
income
,
George
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
n't
an
idea
.
<EOS>
There
never
was
a
closer
man
about
money
.
<EOS>
I
believe
he
must
have
the
bulk
of
the
Tewett
property
some
day
.
<EOS>
He
ca
n't
spend
above
a
couple
of
thousand
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
's
not
in
debt
,
is
he
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
owes
me
a
little
money
,
 
twelve
hundred
or
so
,
and
I
mean
to
have
it
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
he
is
in
debt
,
but
not
much
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
He
makes
stupid
bets
,
and
the
devil
wo
n't
break
him
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Lucinda
has
two
or
three
thousand
pounds
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
a
flea
-
bite
.
<EOS>
Let
her
keep
it
.
<EOS>
You
're
in
for
it
now
,
and
you
'd
better
say
nothing
about
money
.
<EOS>
He
has
a
decent
solicitor
,
and
let
him
arrange
about
the
settlements
.
<EOS>
And
look
here
,
Jane
;
 
get
it
done
as
soon
as
you
can
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
'll
help
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
do
n't
bother
me
,
I
will
.
"
  
<EOS>
On
their
way
home
Mrs.
Carbuncle
was
able
to
tell
Lady
Eustace
.
<EOS>
"
You
know
what
has
occurred
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
dear
,
yes
,
"
said
Lizzie
,
laughing
.
  
<EOS>
"
Has
Lucinda
told
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
think
I
've
got
no
eyes
?
<EOS>
Of
course
it
was
going
to
be
.
<EOS>
I
knew
that
from
the
very
moment
Sir
Griffin
reached
Portray
.
<EOS>
I
am
so
glad
that
Portray
has
been
useful
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
so
useful
,
dear
Lady
Eustace
!
<EOS>
Not
but
what
it
must
have
come
off
anywhere
,
for
there
never
was
a
man
so
much
in
love
as
Sir
Griffin
.
<EOS>
The
difficulty
has
been
with
Lucinda
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
likes
him
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Oh
,
yes
,
of
course
,
"
said
Mrs.
Carbuncle
with
energy
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
that
girls
ever
really
care
about
men
now
.
<EOS>
They
've
got
to
be
married
,
and
they
make
the
best
of
it
.
<EOS>
She
's
very
handsome
,
and
I
suppose
he
's
pretty
well
off
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
will
be
very
rich
indeed
.
<EOS>
And
they
say
he
's
such
an
excellent
young
man
when
you
know
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
dare
say
most
young
men
are
excellent
,
 
when
you
come
to
know
them
.
<EOS>
What
does
Lord
George
say
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
's
in
raptures
.
<EOS>
He
is
very
much
attached
to
Lucinda
,
you
know
.
"
<EOS>
And
so
that
affair
was
managed
.
<EOS>
They
had
n't
been
home
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
Frank
Greystock
was
told
.
<EOS>
He
asked
Mrs.
Carbuncle
about
the
sport
,
and
then
she
whispered
to
him
,
"
An
engagement
has
been
made
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
Griffin
?
"
suggested
Frank
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
smiled
and
nodded
her
head
.
<EOS>
It
was
well
that
everybody
should
know
it
.
   
<EOS>
Sunday
Morning
 
<EOS>
"
So
,
miss
,
you
've
took
him
?
"
said
the
joint
Abigail
of
the
Carbuncle
establishment
that
evening
to
the
younger
of
her
two
mistresses
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
had
resolved
that
the
thing
should
be
quite
public
.
"
<EOS>
Just
remember
this
,
"
replied
Lucinda
,
"
I
do
n't
want
to
have
a
word
<EOS>
said
to
me
on
the
subject
.
"
<EOS>
"
Only
just
to
wish
you
joy
,
miss
.
<EOS>
"
Lucinda
turned
round
with
a
flash
of
anger
at
the
girl
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
want
your
wishing
.
<EOS>
That
'll
do
.
<EOS>
I
can
manage
by
myself
.
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
have
you
come
near
me
if
you
ca
n't
hold
your
tongue
when
you
're
told
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
can
hold
my
tongue
as
well
as
anybody
,
"
said
the
Abigail
with
a
toss
of
her
head
.
  
<EOS>
This
happened
after
the
party
had
separated
for
the
evening
.
<EOS>
At
dinner
Sir
Griffin
had
,
of
course
,
given
Lucinda
his
arm
;
but
so
he
had
always
done
since
they
had
been
at
Portray
.
<EOS>
Lucinda
hardly
opened
her
mouth
at
table
,
and
had
retreated
to
bed
with
a
headache
when
the
men
,
who
on
that
day
lingered
a
few
minutes
after
the
ladies
,
went
into
the
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
This
Sir
Griffin
felt
to
be
almost
an
affront
,
as
there
was
a
certain
process
of
farewell
for
the
night
which
he
had
anticipated
.
<EOS>
If
she
was
going
to
treat
him
like
that
,
he
would
cut
up
rough
,
and
she
should
know
it
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
Griff
,
so
it
's
all
settled
,
"
said
Lord
George
in
the
smoking
-
room
.
<EOS>
Frank
Greystock
was
there
,
and
Sir
Griffin
did
not
like
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
by
settled
?
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
that
anything
is
settled
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
thought
it
was
.
<EOS>
Were
n't
you
told
so
?
"
 
and
Lord
George
turned
to
Greystock
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
thought
I
heard
a
hint
,
"
said
Frank
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
 
---
if
I
ever
knew
such
people
in
my
life
!
"
said
Sir
Griffin
.
<EOS>
"
They
do
n't
seem
to
have
an
idea
that
a
man
's
own
affairs
may
be
private
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Such
an
affair
as
that
never
is
private
,
"
said
Lord
George
.
<EOS>
"
The
women
take
care
of
that
.
<EOS>
You
do
n't
suppose
they
're
going
to
run
down
their
game
,
and
let
nobody
know
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
they
take
me
for
game
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
Of
course
you
're
game
.
<EOS>
Every
man
's
game
.
<EOS>
Only
some
men
are
such
bad
game
that
they
ai
n't
worth
following
.
<EOS>
Take
it
easy
,
Griff
;
you
're
caught
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
I
ai
n't
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
enjoy
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
she
's
about
the
handsomest
girl
out
.
<EOS>
As
for
me
,
I
'd
sooner
have
the
widow
.
<EOS>
I
beg
your
pardon
,
Mr.
Greystock
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Frank
merely
bowed
.
<EOS>
"
Simply
,
I
mean
,
because
she
rides
about
two
stone
lighter
.
<EOS>
It
'll
cost
you
something
to
mount
Lady
Tewett
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
mean
that
she
shall
hunt
,
"
said
Sir
Griffin
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
seen
,
therefore
,
that
the
baronet
made
no
real
attempt
to
deny
his
engagement
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
following
day
,
which
was
a
Sunday
,
Sir
Griffin
,
having
ascertained
that
Miss
Roanoke
did
not
intend
to
go
to
church
,
stayed
at
home
also
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Emilius
had
been
engaged
to
preach
at
the
nearest
episcopal
place
of
worship
,
and
the
remainder
of
the
party
all
went
to
hear
him
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
was
very
particular
about
her
Bible
and
Prayer
-
book
,
and
Miss
Macnulty
wore
a
brighter
ribbon
on
her
bonnet
than
she
had
ever
been
known
to
carry
before
.
<EOS>
Lucinda
,
when
she
had
heard
of
the
arrangement
,
had
protested
to
her
aunt
that
she
would
not
go
down
-
stairs
till
they
had
all
returned
;
but
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
fearing
the
anger
of
Sir
Griffin
,
doubting
whether
,
in
his
anger
,
he
might
not
escape
them
altogether
,
said
a
word
or
two
which
even
Lucinda
found
to
be
rational
.
<EOS>
"
As
you
have
accepted
him
,
you
should
n't
avoid
him
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
That
is
only
making
things
worse
for
the
future
.
<EOS>
And
then
it
's
cowardly
,
is
it
not
?
"
<EOS>
No
word
that
could
have
been
spoken
was
more
likely
to
be
efficacious
.
<EOS>
At
any
rate
,
she
would
not
be
cowardly
.
  
<EOS>
As
soon
then
as
the
wheels
of
the
carriage
were
no
longer
heard
grating
upon
the
road
,
Lucinda
,
who
had
been
very
careful
in
her
dress
,
 
so
careful
as
to
avoid
all
appearance
of
care
,
 
with
slow
majestic
step
descended
to
a
drawing
-
room
which
they
were
accustomed
to
use
on
mornings
.
<EOS>
It
was
probable
that
Sir
Griffin
was
smoking
somewhere
about
the
grounds
,
but
it
could
not
be
her
duty
to
go
after
him
out
of
doors
.
<EOS>
She
would
remain
there
,
and
,
if
he
chose
,
he
might
come
to
her
.
<EOS>
There
could
be
no
ground
of
complaint
on
his
side
if
she
allowed
herself
to
be
found
in
one
of
the
ordinary
sitting
-
rooms
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
In
about
half
an
hour
he
sauntered
upon
the
terrace
,
and
flattened
his
nose
against
the
window
.
<EOS>
She
bowed
and
smiled
to
him
,
 
hating
herself
for
smiling
.
<EOS>
It
was
perhaps
the
first
time
that
she
had
endeavoured
to
put
on
a
pleasant
face
wherewithal
to
greet
him
.
<EOS>
He
said
nothing
then
,
but
passed
round
the
house
,
threw
away
the
end
of
his
cigar
,
and
entered
the
room
.
<EOS>
Whatever
happened
,
she
would
not
be
a
coward
.
<EOS>
The
thing
had
to
be
done
.
<EOS>
Seeing
that
she
had
accepted
him
on
the
previous
day
,
had
not
run
away
in
the
night
or
taken
poison
,
and
had
come
down
to
undergo
the
interview
,
she
would
undergo
it
at
least
with
courage
.
<EOS>
What
did
it
matter
,
even
though
he
should
embrace
her
?
<EOS>
It
was
her
lot
to
undergo
misery
,
and
as
she
had
not
chosen
to
take
poison
,
the
misery
must
be
endured
.
<EOS>
She
rose
as
he
entered
and
gave
him
her
hand
.
<EOS>
She
had
thought
what
she
would
do
,
and
was
collected
and
dignified
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
,
and
was
very
awkward
.
"
<EOS>
So
you
have
n't
gone
to
church
,
Sir
Griffin
,
 
as
you
ought
,
"
she
said
,
with
another
smile
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
;
I
've
gone
as
much
as
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
had
a
headache
.
<EOS>
You
stayed
away
to
smoke
cigars
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
stayed
to
see
you
,
my
girl
.
<EOS>
"
A
lover
may
call
his
lady
love
his
girl
,
and
do
so
very
prettily
.
<EOS>
He
may
so
use
the
word
that
she
will
like
it
,
and
be
grateful
in
her
heart
for
the
sweetness
of
the
sound
.
<EOS>
But
Sir
Griffin
did
not
do
it
nicely
.
<EOS>
"
I
've
got
ever
so
much
to
say
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wo
n't
flatter
you
by
saying
that
I
stayed
to
hear
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
did
;
 
did
n't
you
now
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
shook
her
head
,
but
there
was
something
almost
of
playfulness
in
her
manner
of
doing
it
.
"
<EOS>
Ah
,
but
I
know
you
did
.
<EOS>
And
why
should
n't
you
speak
out
,
now
that
we
are
to
be
man
and
wife
?
<EOS>
I
like
a
girl
to
speak
out
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
if
I
want
to
be
with
you
,
you
want
as
much
to
be
with
me
;
eh
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
see
that
that
follows
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
By
 
---
,
if
it
does
n't
,
I
'll
be
off
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
please
yourself
about
that
,
Sir
Griffin
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Come
;
do
you
love
me
?
<EOS>
You
have
never
said
you
loved
me
.
"
<EOS>
Luckily
perhaps
for
her
he
thought
that
the
best
assurance
of
love
was
a
kiss
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
revolt
,
or
attempt
to
struggle
with
him
;
but
the
hot
blood
flew
over
her
entire
face
,
and
her
lips
were
very
cold
to
his
,
and
she
almost
trembled
in
his
grasp
.
<EOS>
Sir
Griffin
was
not
a
man
who
could
ever
have
been
the
adored
of
many
women
,
but
the
instincts
of
his
kind
were
strong
enough
within
him
to
make
him
feel
that
she
did
not
return
his
embrace
with
passion
.
<EOS>
He
had
found
her
to
be
very
beautiful
;
 
but
it
seemed
to
him
that
she
had
never
been
so
little
beautiful
as
when
thus
pressed
close
to
his
bosom
.
<EOS>
"
Come
,
"
he
said
,
still
holding
her
;
"
you
'll
give
me
a
kiss
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
do
it
,
"
she
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
 
nothing
like
it
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
if
you
wo
n't
,
you
know
 
"
  
On
a
sudden
she
made
up
her
mind
,
and
absolutely
did
kiss
him
.
<EOS>
She
would
sooner
have
leaped
at
the
blackest
,
darkest
,
dirtiest
river
in
the
county
.
<EOS>
"
There
,
"
she
said
,
"
that
will
do
,
"
gently
extricating
herself
from
his
arms
.
<EOS>
"
Some
girls
are
different
,
I
know
;
but
you
must
take
me
as
I
am
,
Sir
Griffin
;
 
that
is
,
if
you
do
take
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
ca
n't
you
drop
the
Sir
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
yes
;
 
I
can
do
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
do
love
me
?
<EOS>
"
There
was
a
pause
,
while
she
tried
to
swallow
the
lie
.
<EOS>
"
Come
;
 
I
'm
not
going
to
marry
any
girl
who
is
ashamed
to
say
that
she
loves
me
.
<EOS>
I
like
a
little
flesh
and
blood
.
<EOS>
You
do
love
me
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
The
lie
was
told
;
and
for
the
moment
he
had
to
be
satisfied
.
<EOS>
But
in
his
heart
he
did
n't
believe
her
.
<EOS>
It
was
all
very
well
for
her
to
say
that
she
was
n't
like
other
girls
.
<EOS>
Why
should
n't
she
be
like
other
girls
?
<EOS>
It
might
,
no
doubt
,
suit
her
to
be
made
Lady
Tewett
;
 
but
he
would
n't
make
her
Lady
Tewett
if
she
gave
herself
airs
with
him
.
<EOS>
She
should
lie
on
his
breast
and
swear
that
she
loved
him
beyond
all
the
world
;
 
or
else
<EOS>
she
should
never
be
Lady
Tewett
.
<EOS>
Different
from
other
girls
indeed
!
<EOS>
She
should
know
that
he
was
different
from
other
men
.
<EOS>
Then
he
asked
her
to
come
and
take
a
walk
about
the
grounds
.
<EOS>
To
that
she
made
no
objection
.
<EOS>
She
would
get
her
hat
and
be
with
him
in
a
minute
.
  
<EOS>
But
she
was
absent
more
than
ten
minutes
.
<EOS>
When
she
was
alone
<EOS>
she
stood
before
her
glass
looking
at
herself
,
and
then
she
burst
into
tears
.
<EOS>
Never
before
had
she
been
thus
polluted
.
<EOS>
The
embrace
had
disgusted
her
.
<EOS>
It
made
her
odious
to
herself
.
<EOS>
And
if
this
,
the
beginning
of
it
,
were
so
bad
,
how
was
she
to
drink
the
cup
to
the
bitter
dregs
?
<EOS>
Other
girls
,
she
knew
,
were
fond
of
their
lovers
,
 
<EOS>
some
so
fond
of
them
that
all
moments
of
absence
were
moments
,
if
not
of
pain
,
at
any
rate
of
regret
.
<EOS>
To
her
,
as
she
stood
there
ready
to
tear
herself
because
of
the
vileness
of
her
own
condition
,
it
now
seemed
as
though
no
such
love
as
that
were
possible
to
her
.
<EOS>
For
the
sake
of
this
man
who
was
to
be
her
husband
,
she
hated
all
men
.
<EOS>
Was
not
everything
around
her
base
,
and
mean
,
and
sordid
?
<EOS>
She
had
understood
thoroughly
the
quick
divulgings
of
Mrs.
Carbuncle
's
tidings
,
the
working
of
her
aunt
's
anxious
mind
.
<EOS>
The
man
,
now
that
he
had
been
caught
,
was
not
to
be
allowed
to
escape
.
<EOS>
But
how
great
would
be
the
boon
if
he
would
escape
.
<EOS>
How
should
she
escape
?
<EOS>
And
yet
she
knew
that
she
meant
to
go
on
and
bear
it
all
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
by
study
and
due
practice
she
might
become
,
 
as
were
some
others
,
 
a
beast
of
prey
,
and
nothing
more
.
<EOS>
The
feeling
that
had
made
these
few
minutes
so
inexpressibly
loathsome
to
her
might
,
perhaps
,
be
driven
from
her
heart
.
<EOS>
She
washed
the
tears
from
her
eyes
with
savage
energy
and
descended
to
her
lover
with
a
veil
fastened
closely
under
her
hat
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I
hope
I
have
n't
kept
you
waiting
,
"
she
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
Women
always
do
,
"
he
replied
laughing
.
<EOS>
"
It
gives
them
importance
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
so
with
me
,
I
can
assure
you
.
<EOS>
I
will
tell
you
the
truth
.
<EOS>
I
was
agitated
,
 
and
I
cried
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
ay
;
I
dare
say
.
<EOS>
"
He
rather
liked
the
idea
of
having
reduced
the
haughty
Lucinda
to
tears
.
<EOS>
"
But
you
need
n't
have
been
ashamed
of
my
seeing
it
.
<EOS>
As
it
is
,
I
can
see
nothing
.
<EOS>
You
must
take
that
off
presently
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
now
,
Griffin
.
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
what
a
name
it
was
!
<EOS>
It
seemed
to
blister
her
tongue
as
she
used
it
without
the
usual
prefix
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
saw
you
tied
up
in
that
way
before
.
<EOS>
You
do
n't
do
it
out
hunting
.
<EOS>
I
've
seen
you
when
the
snow
has
been
driving
in
your
face
,
and
you
did
n't
mind
it
,
 
not
so
much
as
I
did
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
ca
n't
be
surprised
that
I
should
be
agitated
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
're
happy
;
 
ai
n't
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
The
lie
once
told
must
of
course
be
continued
.
  
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
word
,
I
do
n't
quite
understand
you
,
"
said
Sir
Griffin
.
<EOS>
"
Look
here
,
Lucinda
;
if
you
want
to
back
out
of
it
,
you
can
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
ask
me
again
,
I
will
.
<EOS>
"
This
was
said
with
the
old
savage
voice
,
and
it
at
once
reduced
Sir
Griffin
to
thraldom
.
<EOS>
To
be
rejected
now
would
be
the
death
of
him
.
<EOS>
And
should
there
come
a
quarrel
he
was
sure
that
it
would
seem
to
be
that
he
had
been
rejected
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
it
's
all
right
,
"
he
said
;
"
only
when
a
man
is
only
thinking
how
he
can
make
you
happy
,
he
does
n't
like
to
find
nothing
but
crying
.
"
<EOS>
After
this
there
was
but
little
more
said
between
them
before
they
returned
to
the
castle
.
   
<EOS>
Life
at
Portray
 
<EOS>
On
the
Monday
Frank
took
his
departure
.
<EOS>
Everybody
at
the
castle
had
liked
him
except
Sir
Griffin
,
who
,
when
he
had
gone
,
remarked
to
Lucinda
that
he
was
an
insufferable
legal
prig
,
and
one
of
those
chaps
who
think
themselves
somebody
because
they
are
in
Parliament
.
<EOS>
Lucinda
had
liked
Frank
,
and
said
so
very
boldly
.
<EOS>
"
I
see
what
it
is
,
"
replied
Sir
Griffin
;
"
you
always
like
the
people
I
do
n't
.
<EOS>
"
When
he
was
going
,
Lizzie
left
her
hand
in
his
for
a
moment
,
and
gave
one
look
up
into
his
eyes
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
When
is
Lucy
to
be
made
blessed
?
<EOS>
"
she
asked
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
that
Lucy
will
ever
be
made
blessed
,
"
he
replied
,
"
but
I
am
sure
I
hope
she
will
.
"
<EOS>
Not
a
word
more
was
said
,
and
he
returned
to
London
.
  
<EOS>
After
that
Mrs.
Carbuncle
and
Lucinda
remained
at
Portray
Castle
till
after
Christmas
,
greatly
overstaying
the
original
time
fixed
for
their
visit
.
<EOS>
Lord
George
and
Sir
Griffin
went
and
returned
,
and
went
again
and
returned
again
.
<EOS>
There
was
much
hunting
and
a
great
many
love
passages
,
which
need
not
be
recorded
here
.
<EOS>
More
than
once
during
these
six
or
seven
weeks
there
arose
a
quarrel
,
bitter
,
loud
,
and
pronounced
,
between
Sir
Griffin
and
Lucinda
;
but
Lord
George
and
Mrs.
Carbuncle
between
them
managed
to
throw
oil
upon
the
waters
,
and
when
Christmas
came
the
engagement
was
still
an
engagement
.
<EOS>
The
absolute
suggestion
that
it
should
be
broken
,
and
abandoned
,
and
thrown
to
the
winds
,
always
came
from
Lucinda
;
and
Sir
Griffin
,
when
he
found
that
Lucinda
was
in
earnest
,
would
again
be
moved
by
his
old
desires
,
and
would
determine
that
he
would
have
the
thing
he
wanted
.
<EOS>
Once
he
behaved
with
such
coarse
brutality
that
nothing
but
an
abject
apology
would
serve
the
turn
.
<EOS>
He
made
the
abject
apology
,
and
after
that
became
conscious
that
his
wings
were
clipped
,
and
that
he
must
do
as
he
was
bidden
.
<EOS>
Lord
George
took
him
away
,
and
brought
him
back
again
,
and
blew
him
up
;
 
and
at
last
,
under
pressure
from
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
made
him
consent
to
the
fixing
of
a
day
.
<EOS>
The
marriage
was
to
take
place
during
the
first
week
in
April
.
<EOS>
When
the
party
moved
from
Portray
,
he
was
to
go
up
to
London
and
see
his
lawyer
.
<EOS>
Settlements
were
to
be
arranged
,
and
something
was
to
be
fixed
as
to
future
residence
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
midst
of
all
this
Lucinda
was
passive
as
regarded
the
making
of
the
arrangements
,
but
very
troublesome
to
those
around
her
as
to
her
immediate
mode
of
life
.
<EOS>
Even
to
Lady
Eustace
<EOS>
she
was
curt
and
uncivil
.
<EOS>
To
her
aunt
she
was
at
times
ferocious
.
<EOS>
She
told
Lord
George
more
than
once
to
his
face
that
he
was
hurrying
her
to
perdition
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
the
d
 
---
is
it
you
want
?
"
<EOS>
Lord
George
said
to
her
.
"
<EOS>
Not
to
be
married
to
this
man
.
"
<EOS>
"
But
you
have
accepted
him
.
<EOS>
I
did
n't
ask
you
to
take
him
.
<EOS>
You
do
n't
want
to
go
into
a
workhouse
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
Then
she
rode
so
hard
that
all
the
Ayrshire
lairds
were
startled
out
of
their
propriety
,
and
there
was
a
general
fear
that
she
would
meet
some
terrible
accident
.
<EOS>
And
Lizzie
,
instigated
by
jealousy
,
learned
to
ride
as
hard
,
and
as
they
rode
against
each
other
every
day
,
there
was
a
turmoil
in
the
hunt
.
<EOS>
Morgan
,
scratching
his
head
,
declared
that
he
had
known
"
drunken
rampaging
men
,
"
but
had
never
seen
ladies
so
wicked
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
did
come
down
rather
badly
at
one
wall
,
and
Lucinda
got
herself
jammed
against
a
gate
-
post
.
<EOS>
But
when
Christmas
was
come
and
gone
,
and
Portray
Castle
had
been
left
empty
,
no
very
bad
accident
had
occurred
.
  
<EOS>
A
great
friendship
had
sprung
up
between
Mrs.
Carbuncle
and
Lizzie
,
so
that
both
had
become
very
communicative
.
<EOS>
Whether
both
or
either
had
been
candid
may
,
perhaps
,
be
doubted
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
had
been
quite
confidential
in
discussing
with
her
friend
the
dangerous
varieties
of
Lucinda
's
humours
,
and
the
dreadful
aversion
which
she
still
seemed
to
entertain
for
Sir
Griffin
.
<EOS>
But
then
these
humours
and
this
aversion
were
so
visible
,
that
they
could
not
well
be
concealed
;
 
and
what
can
be
the
use
of
confidential
communications
if
things
are
kept
back
which
the
confidante
would
see
even
if
they
were
not
told
?
<EOS>
"
She
would
be
just
like
that
whoever
the
man
was
,
"
said
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
so
,
"
said
Lizzie
,
wondering
at
such
a
phenomenon
in
female
nature
.
<EOS>
But
,
with
this
fact
understood
between
them
to
be
a
fact
,
 
namely
,
that
Lucinda
would
be
sure
to
hate
any
man
whom
she
might
accept
,
 
they
both
agreed
that
the
marriage
had
better
go
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
must
take
a
husband
,
some
day
,
you
know
,
"
said
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
,
"
said
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
"
With
her
good
looks
,
it
would
be
out
of
the
question
that
she
should
n't
be
married
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Quite
out
of
the
question
,
"
repeated
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
really
do
n't
see
how
she
's
to
do
better
.
<EOS>
It
's
her
nature
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
I
have
had
enough
of
it
,
I
can
tell
you
.
<EOS>
And
at
the
pension
,
near
Paris
,
they
could
n't
break
her
in
at
all
.
<EOS>
Nobody
ever
could
break
her
in
.
<EOS>
You
see
it
in
the
way
she
rides
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
Sir
Griffin
must
do
it
,
"
said
Lizzie
laughing
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
;
 
that
,
or
the
other
thing
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
But
there
was
no
doubt
about
this
;
 
whoever
might
break
or
be
broken
,
the
marriage
must
go
on
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
do
n't
persevere
with
one
like
her
,
Lady
Eustace
,
nothing
can
be
done
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Lizzie
quite
concurred
.
<EOS>
What
did
it
matter
to
her
who
should
break
,
or
who
be
broken
,
if
she
could
only
sail
her
own
little
bark
without
dashing
it
on
the
rocks
?
<EOS>
Rocks
there
were
.
<EOS>
She
did
n't
quite
know
what
to
make
of
Lord
George
,
who
certainly
was
a
Corsair
,
 
who
had
said
some
very
pretty
things
to
her
,
quite
à
la
Corsair
.
<EOS>
But
in
the
meantime
,
from
certain
rumours
that
she
heard
,
she
believed
that
Frank
had
given
up
,
or
at
least
was
intending
to
give
up
,
the
little
chit
who
was
living
with
Lady
Linlithgow
.
<EOS>
There
had
been
something
of
a
quarrel
,
 
so
,
at
least
,
she
had
heard
through
Miss
Macnulty
,
with
whom
Lady
Linlithgow
still
occasionally
corresponded
in
spite
of
their
former
breaches
.
<EOS>
From
Frank
,
Lizzie
heard
repeatedly
,
but
Frank
in
his
letters
never
mentioned
the
name
of
Lucy
Morris
.
<EOS>
Now
,
if
there
should
be
a
division
between
Frank
and
Lucy
,
then
,
she
thought
,
Frank
would
return
to
her
.
<EOS>
And
if
so
,
for
a
permanent
holding
rock
of
protection
in
the
world
,
her
cousin
Frank
would
be
at
any
rate
safer
than
the
Corsair
.
  
<EOS>
Lizzie
and
Mrs.
Carbuncle
had
quite
come
to
understand
each
other
comfortably
about
money
.
<EOS>
It
suited
Mrs.
Carbuncle
very
well
to
remain
at
Portray
.
<EOS>
It
was
no
longer
necessary
that
she
should
carry
Lucinda
about
in
search
of
game
to
be
run
down
.
<EOS>
The
one
head
of
game
needed
had
been
run
down
,
such
as
it
was
,
 
not
,
indeed
,
a
very
noble
stag
;
but
the
stag
had
been
accepted
;
and
a
home
for
herself
and
her
niece
,
which
should
have
about
it
a
sufficient
air
of
fashion
to
satisfy
public
opinion
,
 
out
of
London
,
 
better
still
,
in
Scotland
,
belonging
to
a
person
with
a
title
,
enjoying
the
appurtenances
of
wealth
,
and
one
to
which
Lord
George
and
Sir
Griffin
could
have
access
,
 
was
very
desirable
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
out
of
the
question
that
Lady
Eustace
should
bear
all
the
expense
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
undertook
to
find
the
stables
,
and
did
pay
for
that
rick
of
hay
and
for
the
cart
-
load
of
forage
which
had
made
Lizzie
's
heart
quake
as
she
saw
it
dragged
up
the
hill
towards
her
own
granaries
.
<EOS>
It
is
very
comfortable
when
all
these
things
are
clearly
understood
.
<EOS>
Early
in
January
they
were
all
to
go
back
to
London
.
<EOS>
Then
for
a
while
,
 
up
to
the
period
of
Lucinda
's
marriage
,
 
Lizzie
was
to
be
Mrs.
Carbuncle
's
guest
at
the
small
house
in
Mayfair
;
 
but
Lizzie
was
to
keep
the
carriage
.
<EOS>
There
came
at
last
to
be
some
little
attempt
,
perhaps
,
at
a
hard
bargain
at
the
hand
of
each
lady
,
in
which
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
as
the
elder
,
probably
got
the
advantage
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
question
about
the
liveries
in
London
.
<EOS>
The
footman
there
must
appertain
to
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
whereas
the
coachman
would
as
necessarily
be
one
of
Lizzie
's
retainers
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
assented
at
last
to
finding
the
double
livery
,
 
but
,
like
a
prudent
woman
,
arranged
to
get
her
quid
pro
quo
.
<EOS>
"
You
can
add
something
,
you
know
,
to
the
present
you
'll
have
to
give
Lucinda
.
<EOS>
Lucinda
shall
choose
something
up
to
forty
pounds
.
"
<EOS>
"
We
'll
say
thirty
,
"
said
Lizzie
,
who
was
beginning
to
know
the
value
of
money
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Split
the
difference
,
"
said
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
with
a
pleasant
little
burst
of
laughter
,
 
and
the
difference
was
split
.
<EOS>
That
the
very
neat
and
even
dandified
appearance
of
the
groom
who
rode
out
hunting
with
them
should
be
provided
at
the
expense
of
Mrs.
Carbuncle
was
quite
understood
;
but
it
was
equally
well
understood
that
Lizzie
was
to
provide
the
horse
on
which
he
rode
,
on
every
third
day
.
<EOS>
It
adds
greatly
to
the
comfort
of
friends
living
together
when
these
things
are
accurately
settled
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Emilius
remained
longer
than
had
been
anticipated
,
and
did
not
go
till
Lord
George
and
Sir
Griffin
took
their
departure
.
<EOS>
It
was
observed
that
he
never
spoke
of
his
wife
;
and
yet
Mrs.
Carbuncle
was
almost
sure
that
she
had
heard
of
such
a
lady
.
<EOS>
He
had
made
himself
very
agreeable
,
and
was
,
either
by
art
or
nature
,
a
courteous
man
,
 
one
who
paid
compliments
to
ladies
.
<EOS>
It
was
true
,
however
,
that
he
sometimes
startled
his
hearers
by
things
which
might
have
been
considered
to
border
on
coarseness
if
they
had
not
been
said
by
a
clergyman
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
had
an
idea
that
he
intended
to
marry
Miss
Macnulty
.
<EOS>
And
Miss
Macnulty
certainly
received
his
attentions
with
pleasure
.
<EOS>
In
these
circumstances
his
prolonged
stay
at
the
castle
was
not
questioned
;
 
but
when
towards
the
end
of
November
Lord
George
and
Sir
Griffin
took
their
departure
,
he
was
obliged
to
return
to
his
flock
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
great
subject
of
the
diamonds
Lizzie
had
spoken
her
mind
freely
to
Mrs.
Carbuncle
early
in
the
days
of
their
friendship
,
 
immediately
,
that
is
,
after
the
bargainings
had
been
completed
.
<EOS>
"
Ten
thousand
pounds
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
opening
wide
her
eyes
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
nodded
her
head
thrice
,
in
token
of
reiterated
assurance
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Do
you
mean
that
you
really
know
their
value
?
<EOS>
"
The
ladies
at
this
time
were
closeted
together
,
and
were
discussing
many
things
in
the
closest
confidence
.

"
They
were
valued
for
me
by
jewellers
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ten
thousand
pounds
!
<EOS>
And
Sir
Florian
gave
them
to
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Put
them
round
my
neck
,
and
told
me
they

<EOS>
"
Generous
man
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
if
you
had
but
known
him
!
"
said
Lizzie
,
just
touching
her
eye
with
her
handkerchief
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
daresay
.
<EOS>
And
now
the
people
claim
them
.
<EOS>
I
'm
not
a
bit
surprised
at
that
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
thought
a
man
could
n't
give
away
so
much
as
that
,
 
not
just
as
one
makes
a
present
that
costs
forty
or
fifty
pounds
.
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
could
not
resist
the
opportunity
of
showing
that
she
did
not
think
so
very
much
of
that
coming
thirty
-
five
-
pound
"
gift
"
for
which
the
bargain
had
been
made
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
what
they
say
.
<EOS>
And
they
say
ever
so
many
other
things
besides
.
<EOS>
They
mean
to
prove
that
it
's
an
 
heirloom
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
it
is
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
it
is
n't
.
<EOS>
My
cousin
Frank
,
who
knows
more
about
law
than
any
other
man
in
London
,
says
that
they
ca
n't
make
a
necklace
an
heirloom
.
<EOS>
If
it
was
a
brooch
or
a
ring
it
would
be
different
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
quite
understand
it
,
but
it
is
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
pity
Sir
Florian
did
n't
say
something
about
it
in
his
will
,
"
suggested
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
he
did
;
 
at
least
,
not
just
about
the
necklace
.
"
<EOS>
Then
Lady
Eustace
explained
the
nature
of
her
late
husband
's
will
,
as
far
as
it
regarded
chattels
to
be
found
in
the
Castle
of
Portray
at
the
time
of
his
death
;
and
added
the
fiction
,
which
had
now
become
common
to
her
,
as
to
the
necklace
having
been
given
to
her
in
Scotland
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
n't
let
them
have
it
,
"
said
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
mean
,
"
said
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
 
sell
them
,
"
said
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
why
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Because
there
are
so
many
accidents
.
<EOS>
A
woman
should
be
very
rich
indeed
before
she
allows
herself
to
walk
about
with
ten
thousand
pounds
upon
her
shoulders
.
<EOS>
Suppose
somebody
broke
into
the
house
and
stole
them
.
<EOS>
And
if
they
were
sold
,
my
dear
,
so
that
some
got
to
Paris
,
and
others
to
St.
Petersburg
,
and
others
to
New
York
,
they
'd
have
to
give
it
up
then
.
<EOS>
"
Before
the
discussion
was
over
,
Lizzie
tripped
up
-
stairs
and
brought
the
necklace
down
,
and
put
it
on
Mrs.
Carbuncle
's
neck
.
<EOS>
"
I
should
n't
like
to
have
such
property
in
my
house
,
my
dear
,
"
continued
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
<EOS>
"
Of
course
,
diamonds
are
very
nice
.
<EOS>
Nothing
is
so
nice
.
<EOS>
And
if
a
person
had
a
proper
place
to
keep
them
,
and
all
that
 
"
  
"
I
've
a
very
strong
iron
case
,
"
said
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
they
should
be
at
the
bank
,
or
at
the
jewellers
,
or
somewhere
quite
 
quite
safe
.
<EOS>
People
might
steal
the
case
and
all
.
<EOS>
If
I
were
you
,
I
should
sell
them
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
explained
to
Mrs.
Carbuncle
on
that
occasion
that
Lizzie
had
brought
them
down
with
her
in
the
train
from
London
,
and
that
she
intended
to
take
them
back
in
the
same
way
.
<EOS>
"
There
's
nothing
the
thieves
would
find
easier
than
to
steal
them
on
the
way
,
"
said
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
some
days
after
this
that
there
came
down
to
her
by
post
some
terribly
frightful
documents
,
which
were
the
first
results
,
as
far
as
she
was
concerned
,
of
the
filing
of
a
bill
in
Chancery
;
 
which
hostile
proceeding
was
,
in
truth
,
effected
by
the
unaided
energy
of
Mr.
Camperdown
,
although
Mr.
Camperdown
put
himself
forward
simply
as
an
instrument
used
by
the
trustees
of
the
Eustace
property
.
<EOS>
Within
eight
days
she
was
to
enter
an
appearance
,
or
go
through
some
preliminary
ceremony
towards
showing
why
she
should
not
surrender
her
diamonds
to
the
Lord
Chancellor
,
or
to
one
of
those
satraps
of
his
,
the
Vice
-
Chancellors
,
or
to
some
other
terrible
myrmidon
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Camperdown
in
his
letter
explained
that
the
service
of
this
document
upon
her
in
Scotland
would
amount
to
nothing
,
 
<EOS>
even
were
he
to
send
it
down
by
a
messenger
;
but
that
,
no
doubt
,
she
would
send
it
to
her
attorney
,
who
would
see
the
expedience
of
avoiding
exposure
by
accepting
the
service
.
<EOS>
Of
all
which
explanation
Lizzie
did
not
understand
one
word
.
<EOS>
Messrs.
Camperdowns
"
letter
and
the
document
which
it
contained
did
frighten
her
considerably
,
although
the
matter
had
been
discussed
so
often
that
she
had
accustomed
herself
to
declare
that
no
such
bugbears
as
that
should
have
any
influence
on
her
.
<EOS>
She
had
asked
Frank
whether
,
in
the
event
of
such
missiles
reaching
her
,
she
might
send
them
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
had
told
her
that
they
should
be
at
once
placed
in
the
hands
of
her
attorney
;
 
and
consequently
she
now
sent
them
to
Messrs.
Mowbray
and
Mopus
,
with
a
very
short
note
from
herself
.
"
<EOS>
Lady
Eustace
presents
her
compliments
to
Messrs.
Mowbray
and
Mopus
,
and
encloses
some
papers
she
has
received
about
her
diamonds
.
<EOS>
They
are
her
own
diamonds
,
given
to
her
by
her
late
husband
.
<EOS>
Please
do
what
is
proper
,
but
Mr.
Camperdown
ought
to
be
made
to
pay
all
the
expenses
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
had
,
no
doubt
,
allowed
herself
to
hope
that
no
further
steps
would
be
taken
in
the
matter
;
and
the
very
name
of
the
Vice
-
Chancellor
did
for
a
few
hours
<EOS>
chill
the
blood
at
her
heart
.
<EOS>
In
those
few
hours
she
almost
longed
to
throw
the
necklace
into
the
sea
,
feeling
sure
that
,
if
the
diamonds
were
absolutely
lost
,
there
must
be
altogether
an
end
of
the
matter
.
<EOS>
But
,
by
degrees
,
her
courage
returned
to
her
,
as
she
remembered
that
her
cousin
had
told
her
that
,
as
far
as
he
could
see
,
the
necklace
was
legally
her
own
.
<EOS>
Her
cousin
had
,
of
course
,
been
deceived
by
the
lies
which
she
had
repeated
to
him
;
but
lies
which
had
been
efficacious
with
him
might
be
efficacious
with
others
.
<EOS>
Who
could
prove
that
Sir
Florian
had
not
taken
the
diamonds
to
Scotland
,
and
given
them
to
her
there
,
in
that
very
house
which
was
now
her
own
?
  
<EOS>
She
told
Mrs.
Carbuncle
of
the
missiles
which
had
been
hurled
at
her
from
the
London
courts
of
law
,
and
Mrs.
Carbuncle
evidently
thought
that
the
diamonds
were
as
good
as
gone
.
"
<EOS>
Then
I
suppose
you
ca
n't
sell
them
?
"
said
she
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
could
;
 
I
could
sell
them
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
What
is
to
hinder
me
?
<EOS>
Suppose
I
took
them
to
jewellers
in
Paris
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
jewellers
would
think
you
had
stolen
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
steal
them
,
"
said
Lizzie
;
<EOS>
"
they
're
my
very
own
.
<EOS>
Frank
says
that
nobody
can
take
them
away
from
me
.
<EOS>
Why
should
n't
a
man
give
his
wife
a
diamond
necklace
as
well
as
a
diamond
ring
?
<EOS>
That
's
what
I
ca
n't
understand
.
<EOS>
What
may
he
give
her
so
that
men
sha'n't
come
and
worry
her
life
out
of
her
in
this
way
?
<EOS>
As
for
an
heirloom
,
anybody
who
knows
anything
,
knows
that
it
ca
n't
be
an
heirloom
.
<EOS>
A
pot
or
a
pan
may
be
an
heirloom
;
 
but
a
diamond
necklace
can
not
be
an
heirloom
.
<EOS>
Everybody
knows
that
,
that
knows
anything
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
daresay
it
will
all
come
right
,
"
said
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
who
did
not
in
the
least
believe
Lizzie
's
law
about
the
pot
and
pan
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
first
week
in
January
Lord
George
and
Sir
Griffin
returned
to
the
castle
with
the
view
of
travelling
up
to
London
with
the
three
ladies
.
<EOS>
This
arrangement
was
partly
thrown
over
by
circumstances
,
as
Sir
Griffin
was
pleased
to
leave
Portray
two
days
before
the
others
and
to
travel
by
himself
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
bitter
quarrel
between
Lucinda
and
her
lover
,
and
it
was
understood
afterwards
by
Lady
Eustace
that
Sir
Griffin
had
had
a
few
words
with
Lord
George
;
 
but
what
those
few
words
were
,
she
never
quite
knew
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
open
rupture
between
the
two
gentlemen
,
but
Sir
Griffin
showed
his
displeasure
to
the
ladies
,
who
were
more
likely
to
bear
patiently
his
ill
-
humour
in
the
present
circumstances
than
was
Lord
George
.
<EOS>
When
a
man
has
shown
himself
to
be
so
far
amenable
to
feminine
authority
as
to
have
put
himself
in
the
way
of
matrimony
,
ladies
will
bear
a
great
deal
from
him
.
<EOS>
There
was
nothing
which
Mrs.
Carbuncle
would
not
endure
from
Sir
Griffin
,
 
just
at
present
;
and
,
on
behalf
of
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
even
Lizzie
was
long
-
suffering
.
<EOS>
It
can
not
,
however
,
be
said
that
this
Petruchio
had
as
yet
tamed
his
own
peculiar
shrew
.
<EOS>
Lucinda
was
as
savage
as
ever
,
and
would
snap
and
snarl
,
and
almost
bite
.
<EOS>
Sir
Griffin
would
snarl
too
,
and
say
very
bearish
things
.
<EOS>
But
when
it
came
to
the
point
of
actual
quarrelling
,
he
would
become
sullen
,
and
in
his
sullenness
would
yield
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
see
why
Carruthers
should
have
it
all
his
own
way
,
"
he
said
,
one
hunting
morning
,
to
Lucinda
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
care
twopence
who
have
their
way
,
"
said
Lucinda
,
"
I
mean
to
have
mine
;
 
<EOS>
that
's
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
not
speaking
about
you
.
<EOS>
I
call
it
downright
interference
on
his
part
.
<EOS>
And
I
do
think
you
give
way
to
him
.
<EOS>
You
never
do
anything
that
I
suggest
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
never
suggest
anything
that
I
like
to
do
,
"
said
Lucinda
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
a
pity
,
"
said
Sir
Griffin
,
"
considering
that
I
shall
have
to
suggest
so
many
things
that
you
will
have
to
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
that
at
all
,
"
said
Lucinda
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
came
up
during
the
quarrel
,
meaning
to
throw
oil
upon
the
waters
.
<EOS>
"
What
children
you
are
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
laughing
.
<EOS>
"
As
if
each
of
you
wo
n't
have
to
do
what
the
other
suggests
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
"
began
Sir
Griffin
,
"
if
you
will
have
the
great
kindness
not
to
endeavour
to
teach
me
what
my
conduct
should
be
now
or
at
any
future
time
,
I
shall
take
it
as
a
kindness
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Sir
Griffin
,
pray
do
n't
quarrel
with
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
"
said
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
"
Lady
Eustace
,
if
Mrs.
Carbuncle
interferes
with
me
,
I
shall
quarrel
with
her
.
<EOS>
I
have
borne
a
great
deal
more
of
this
kind
of
thing
than
I
like
.
<EOS>
I
'm
not
going
to
be
told
this
and
told
that
because
Mrs.
Carbuncle
happens
to
be
the
aunt
of
the
future
Lady
Tewett
,
 
if
it
should
come
to
that
.
<EOS>
I
'm
not
going
to
marry
a
whole
family
;
and
the
less
I
have
of
this
kind
of
thing
the
more
likely
<EOS>
it
is
that
I
shall
come
up
to
scratch
when
the
time
is
up
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Then
Lucinda
rose
and
spoke
.
"
<EOS>
Sir
Griffin
Tewett
,
"
she
said
,
"
there
is
not
the
slightest
necessity
that
you
should
come
up
 
"
to
scratch
.
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
that
I
have
not
as
yet
been
able
to
make
you
understand
that
if
it
will
suit
your
convenience
to
break
off
our
match
,
it
will
not
in
the
least
interfere
with
mine
.
<EOS>
And
let
me
tell
you
this
,
Sir
Griffin
,
 
that
any
repetition
of
your
unkindness
to
my
aunt
will
make
me
utterly
refuse
to
see
you
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
,
you
like
her
better
than
you
do
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
great
deal
better
,
"
said
Lucinda
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
stand
that
I
'll
be
 
---
,
"
said
Sir
Griffin
,
leaving
the
room
.
<EOS>
And
he
left
the
castle
,
sleeping
that
night
at
the
inn
at
Kilmarnock
.
<EOS>
The
day
,
however
,
was
passed
in
hunting
;
and
though
he
said
nothing
to
either
of
the
three
ladies
,
it
was
understood
by
them
as
they
returned
to
Portray
that
there
was
to
be
no
quarrel
.
<EOS>
Lord
George
and
Sir
Griffin
had
discussed
the
matter
,
and
Lord
George
took
upon
himself
to
say
that
there
was
no
quarrel
.
<EOS>
On
the
morning
but
one
following
,
there
came
a
note
from
Sir
Griffin
to
Lucinda
,
 
just
as
they
were
leaving
home
for
their
journey
up
to
London
,
 
in
which
Sir
Griffin
expressed
his
regret
if
he
had
said
anything
displeasing
to
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
   
<EOS>
A
Midnight
Adventure
 
<EOS>
Something
as
to
the
jewels
had
been
told
to
Lord
George
;
 
and
this
was
quite
necessary
,
as
Lord
George
intended
to
travel
with
the
ladies
from
Portray
to
London
.
<EOS>
Of
course
,
he
had
heard
of
the
diamonds
,
 
as
who
had
not
?
<EOS>
He
had
heard
too
of
Lord
Fawn
,
and
knew
why
it
was
that
Lord
Fawn
had
peremptorily
refused
to
carry
out
his
engagement
.
<EOS>
But
,
till
he
was
told
by
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
he
did
not
know
that
the
diamonds
were
then
kept
within
the
castle
,
nor
did
he
understand
that
it
would
be
part
of
his
duty
to
guard
them
on
their
way
back
to
London
.
<EOS>
"
They
are
worth
ever
so
much
;
ai
n't
they
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
to
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
when
she
first
gave
him
the
information
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ten
thousand
pounds
,
"
said
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
almost
with
awe
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
believe
a
word
of
it
,
"
said
Lord
George
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
says
that
they
've
been
valued
at
that
,
since
she
's
had
them
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lord
George
owned
to
himself
that
such
a
necklace
was
worth
having
,
 
as
also
,
no
doubt
,
were
Portray
Castle
and
the
income
arising
from
the
estate
,
even
though
they
could
be
held
in
possession
only
for
a
single
life
.
<EOS>
Hitherto
in
his
very
chequered
career
he
had
escaped
the
trammels
of
matrimony
,
and
among
his
many
modes
of
life
had
hardly
even
suggested
to
himself
the
expediency
of
taking
a
wife
with
a
fortune
,
and
then
settling
down
for
the
future
,
if
submissively
,
still
comfortably
.
<EOS>
To
say
that
he
had
never
looked
forward
to
such
a
marriage
as
a
possible
future
arrangement
would
probably
be
incorrect
.
<EOS>
To
men
such
as
Lord
George
it
is
too
easy
a
result
of
a
career
to
be
altogether
banished
from
the
mind
.
<EOS>
But
no
attempt
had
ever
yet
been
made
,
nor
had
any
special
lady
ever
been
so
far
honoured
in
his
thoughts
as
to
be
connected
in
them
with
any
vague
ideas
which
he
might
have
formed
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
But
now
it
did
occur
to
him
that
Portray
Castle
was
a
place
in
which
he
could
pass
two
or
three
months
annually
without
ennui
;
and
that
if
he
were
to
marry
,
little
Lizzie
Eustace
would
do
as
well
as
any
other
woman
with
money
whom
he
might
chance
to
meet
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
say
all
this
to
anybody
,
and
therefore
can
not
be
accused
of
vanity
.
<EOS>
He
was
the
last
man
in
the
world
to
speak
on
such
a
subject
to
any
one
.
<EOS>
And
as
our
Lizzie
certainly
bestowed
upon
him
many
of
her
smiles
,
much
of
her
poetry
,
and
some
of
her
confidence
,
it
can
not
be
said
that
he
was
not
justified
in
his
views
.
<EOS>
But
then
she
was
such
"
an
infernal
little
liar
.
"
<EOS>
Lord
George
was
quite
able
to
discover
so
much
of
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
does
lie
,
certainly
,
"
said
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
"
but
then
who
does
n't
?
"
  
<EOS>
On
the
morning
of
their
departure
the
box
with
the
diamonds
was
brought
down
into
the
hall
just
as
they
were
about
to
depart
.
<EOS>
The
tall
London
footman
again
brought
it
down
,
and
deposited
it
on
one
of
the
oak
hall
-
chairs
,
as
though
it
were
a
thing
so
heavy
that
he
could
hardly
stagger
along
with
it
.
<EOS>
How
Lizzie
did
hate
the
man
as
she
watched
him
,
and
regret
that
she
had
not
attempted
to
carry
it
down
herself
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
with
her
diamonds
that
morning
,
and
had
seen
them
out
of
the
box
and
into
it
.
<EOS>
Few
days
passed
on
which
she
did
not
handle
them
and
gaze
at
them
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
had
suggested
that
the
box
,
with
all
her
diamonds
in
it
,
might
be
stolen
from
her
,
 
and
as
she
thought
of
this
her
heart
almost
sank
within
her
.
<EOS>
When
she
had
them
once
again
in
London
she
would
take
some
steps
to
relieve
herself
from
this
embarrassment
of
carrying
about
with
her
so
great
a
burthen
of
care
.
<EOS>
The
man
,
with
a
vehement
show
of
exertion
,
deposited
the
box
on
a
chair
,
and
then
groaned
aloud
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
knew
very
well
that
she
could
lift
the
box
by
her
own
unaided
exertions
,
and
that
the
groan
was
at
any
rate
unnecessary
.
  
<EOS>
"
Supposing
somebody
were
to
steal
that
on
the
way
,
"
said
Lord
George
to
her
,
not
in
his
pleasantest
tone
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
not
suggest
anything
so
horrible
,
"
said
Lizzie
,
trying
to
laugh
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
n't
like
it
at
all
,
"
said
Lord
George
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
it
would
make
me
a
bit
unhappy
.
<EOS>
You
've
heard
about
it
all
.
<EOS>
There
never
was
such
a
persecution
.
<EOS>
I
often
say
that
I
should
be
well
pleased
to
take
the
bauble
and
fling
it
into
the
ocean
waves
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
to
be
a
mermaid
and
catch
it
,
"
said
Lord
George
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
better
would
you
be
?
<EOS>
Such
things
are
all
vanity
and
vexation
of
spirit
.
<EOS>
I
hate
the
shining
thing
.
"
<EOS>
And
she
hit
the
box
with
the
whip
she
held
in
her
hand
.
  
<EOS>
It
had
been
arranged
that
the
party
should
sleep
at
Carlisle
.
<EOS>
It
consisted
of
Lord
George
,
the
three
ladies
,
the
tall
man
servant
,
Lord
George
's
own
man
,
and
the
two
maids
.
<EOS>
Miss
Macnulty
,
with
the
heir
and
the
nurses
,
were
to
remain
at
Portray
for
yet
a
while
longer
.
<EOS>
The
iron
box
was
again
put
into
the
carriage
,
and
was
used
by
Lizzie
as
a
footstool
.
<EOS>
This
might
have
been
very
well
,
had
there
been
no
necessity
for
changing
their
train
.
<EOS>
At
Troon
the
porter
behaved
well
,
and
did
not
struggle
much
as
he
carried
it
from
the
carriage
on
to
the
platform
.
<EOS>
But
at
Kilmarnock
,
where
they
met
the
train
from
Glasgow
,
the
big
footman
interfered
again
,
and
the
scene
was
performed
under
the
eyes
of
a
crowd
of
people
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
to
Lizzie
that
Lord
George
almost
encouraged
the
struggling
,
as
though
he
were
in
league
with
the
footman
to
annoy
her
.
<EOS>
But
there
was
no
further
change
between
Kilmarnock
and
Carlisle
,
and
they
managed
to
make
themselves
very
comfortable
.
<EOS>
Lunch
had
been
provided
;
 
for
Mrs.
Carbuncle
<EOS>
was
a
woman
who
cared
for
such
things
,
and
Lord
George
also
liked
a
glass
of
champagne
in
the
middle
of
the
day
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
professed
to
be
perfectly
indifferent
on
such
matters
;
but
nevertheless
she
enjoyed
her
lunch
,
and
allowed
Lord
George
to
press
upon
her
a
second
,
and
perhaps
a
portion
of
a
third
glass
of
wine
.
<EOS>
Even
Lucinda
was
roused
up
from
her
general
state
of
apathy
,
and
permitted
herself
to
forget
Sir
Griffin
for
a
while
.
  
<EOS>
During
this
journey
to
Carlisle
Lizzie
Eustace
almost
made
up
her
mind
that
Lord
George
was
the
very
Corsair
she
had
been
expecting
ever
since
she
had
mastered
Lord
Byron
's
great
poem
.
<EOS>
He
had
a
way
of
doing
things
and
of
saying
things
,
of
proclaiming
himself
to
be
master
,
and
at
the
same
time
of
making
himself
thoroughly
agreeable
to
his
dependants
,
 
and
especially
to
the
one
dependant
whom
he
most
honoured
at
the
time
,
 
which
exactly
suited
Lizzie
's
ideas
of
what
a
man
should
be
.
<EOS>
And
then
he
possessed
that
utter
indifference
to
all
conventions
and
laws
,
which
is
the
great
prerogative
of
Corsairs
.
<EOS>
He
had
no
reverence
for
aught
divine
or
human
,
 
which
is
a
great
thing
.
<EOS>
The
Queen
and
Parliament
,
the
bench
of
bishops
,
and
even
the
police
,
were
to
him
just
so
many
fungi
and
parasites
,
and
noxious
vapours
,
and
false
hypocrites
.
<EOS>
Such
were
the
names
by
which
he
ventured
to
call
these
bugbears
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
It
was
so
delightful
to
live
with
a
man
who
himself
had
a
title
of
his
own
,
but
who
could
speak
of
dukes
and
marquises
as
being
quite
despicable
by
reason
of
their
absurd
position
.
<EOS>
And
as
they
became
gay
and
free
after
their
luncheon
he
expressed
almost
as
much
contempt
for
honesty
as
for
dukes
,
and
showed
clearly
that
he
regarded
matrimony
and
marquises
to
be
equally
vain
and
useless
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
How
dare
you
say
such
things
in
our
hearing
!
"
exclaimed
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
assert
that
if
men
and
women
were
really
true
,
no
vows
would
be
needed
;
 
and
if
no
vows
,
then
no
marriage
vows
.
<EOS>
Do
you
believe
such
vows
are
kept
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Mrs.
Carbuncle
enthusiastically
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
,
"
said
Lucinda
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Nor
I
,
"
said
the
Corsair
.
<EOS>
"
Who
can
believe
that
a
woman
will
always
love
her
husband
because
she
swears
she
will
?
<EOS>
The
oath
is
false
on
the
face
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
women
must
marry
,
"
said
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
The
Corsair
declared
freely
that
he
did
not
see
any
such
necessity
.
  
<EOS>
And
then
,
though
it
could
hardly
be
said
that
this
Corsair
was
a
handsome
man
,
still
he
had
fine
Corsair
's
eyes
,
full
of
expression
and
determination
,
eyes
that
could
look
love
and
bloodshed
almost
at
the
same
time
;
and
then
he
had
those
manly
properties
,
 
power
,
bigness
,
and
apparent
boldness
,
 
which
belong
to
a
Corsair
.
<EOS>
To
be
hurried
about
the
world
by
such
a
man
,
treated
sometimes
with
crushing
severity
,
and
at
others
with
the
tenderest
love
,
not
to
be
spoken
to
for
one
fortnight
,
and
then
to
be
embraced
perpetually
for
another
,
to
be
cast
every
now
and
then
into
some
abyss
of
despair
by
his
rashness
,
and
then
raised
to
a
pinnacle
of
human
joy
by
his
courage
,
 
that
,
thought
Lizzie
,
would
be
the
kind
of
life
which
would
suit
her
poetical
temperament
.
<EOS>
But
then
,
how
would
it
be
with
her
,
if
the
Corsair
were
to
take
to
hurrying
about
the
world
without
carrying
her
with
him
;
 
and
were
to
do
so
always
at
her
expense
!
<EOS>
Perhaps
he
might
hurry
about
the
world
and
take
somebody
else
with
him
.
<EOS>
Medora
,
if
Lizzie
remembered
rightly
,
had
had
no
jointure
or
private
fortune
.
<EOS>
But
yet
a
woman
must
risk
something
if
the
spirit
of
poetry
is
to
be
allowed
any
play
at
all
!
"
<EOS>
And
now
these
weary
diamonds
again
,
"
said
Lord
George
,
as
the
carriage
was
stopped
against
the
Carlisle
platform
.
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
they
must
go
into
your
bedroom
,
Lady
Eustace
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
you
'd
let
the
man
put
the
box
in
yours
;
 
just
for
this
night
,
"
said
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
 
not
if
I
know
it
,
"
said
Lord
George
.
<EOS>
And
then
he
explained
.
<EOS>
Such
property
would
be
quite
as
liable
to
be
stolen
when
in
his
custody
as
it
would
in
hers
;
 
but
if
stolen
while
in
his
would
entail
upon
him
a
grievous
vexation
which
would
by
no
means
lessen
the
effect
of
her
loss
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
understand
him
,
but
finding
that
he
was
quite
in
earnest
<EOS>
she
directed
that
the
box
should
be
again
taken
to
her
own
chamber
.
<EOS>
Lord
George
suggested
that
it
should
be
entrusted
to
the
landlord
;
and
for
a
moment
or
two
Lizzie
submitted
to
the
idea
.
<EOS>
But
she
stood
for
that
moment
thinking
of
it
,
and
then
decided
that
the
box
should
go
to
her
own
room
.
<EOS>
"
There
's
no
knowing
what
that
Mr.
Camperdown
might
n't
do
,
"
she
whispered
to
Lord
George
.
<EOS>
The
porter
and
the
tall
footman
,
between
them
,
staggered
along
under
their
load
,
and
the
iron
box
was
again
deposited
in
the
bedroom
of
the
Carlisle
inn
.
  
<EOS>
The
evening
at
Carlisle
was
spent
very
pleasantly
.
<EOS>
The
ladies
agreed
that
they
would
not
dress
,
 
but
of
course
they
did
so
with
more
or
less
of
care
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
made
herself
to
look
very
pretty
,
though
the
skirt
of
the
gown
in
which
she
came
down
was
that
which
she
had
worn
during
the
journey
.
<EOS>
Pointing
this
out
with
much
triumph
,
she
accused
Mrs.
Carbuncle
and
Lucinda
of
great
treachery
,
in
that
they
had
not
adhered
to
any
vestige
of
their
travelling
raiment
.
<EOS>
But
the
rancour
was
not
vehement
,
and
the
evening
was
passed
pleasantly
.
<EOS>
Lord
George
was
infinitely
petted
by
the
three
Houris
around
him
,
and
Lizzie
called
him
a
Corsair
to
his
face
.
<EOS>
"
And
you
are
the
Medora
,
"
said
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
no
.
<EOS>
That
is
your
place
,
 
certainly
,
"
said
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
a
pity
Sir
Griffin
is
n't
here
,
"
said
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
"
that
we
might
call
him
the
Giaour
.
"
<EOS>
Lucinda
shuddered
,
without
any
attempt
at
concealing
her
shudder
.
<EOS>
"
That
's
all
very
well
,
Lucinda
,
but
I
think
Sir
Griffin
would
make
a
very
good
Giaour
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Pray
do
n't
,
aunt
.
<EOS>
Let
one
forget
it
all
just
for
a
moment
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
what
Sir
Griffin
would
say
if
he
was
to
hear
this
!
"
said
Lord
George
.
  
<EOS>
Late
in
the
evening
Lord
George
strolled
out
,
and
of
course
the
ladies
discussed
his
character
in
his
absence
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
declared
that
he
was
the
soul
of
honour
.
<EOS>
In
regard
to
her
own
feeling
for
him
,
she
averred
that
no
woman
had
ever
had
a
truer
friend
.
<EOS>
Any
other
sentiment
was
of
course
out
of
the
question
,
 
for
was
she
not
a
married
woman
?
<EOS>
Had
it
not
been
for
that
accident
,
Mrs.
Carbuncle
really
thought
that
she
could
have
given
her
heart
to
Lord
George
.
<EOS>
Lucinda
declared
that
she
always
regarded
him
as
a
kind
of
supplementary
father
.
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
he
is
a
year
or
two
older
than
Sir
Griffin
,
"
said
Lizzie
.
"
<EOS>
Lady
Eustace
,
why
should
you
make
me
unhappy
?
"
said
Lucinda
.
<EOS>
Then
Mrs.
Carbuncle
explained
,
that
whereas
Sir
Griffin
was
not
yet
thirty
,
Lord
George
was
over
forty
.
<EOS>
"
All
I
can
say
is
,
he
does
n't
look
it
,
"
urged
Lady
Eustace
enthusiastically
.
<EOS>
"
Those
sort
of
men
never
do
,
"
said
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
<EOS>
Lord
George
,
when
he
returned
,
was
greeted
with
an
allusion
to
angels
"
wings
,
 
and
would
have
been
<EOS>
a
good
deal
spoilt
among
them
were
it
in
the
nature
of
such
an
article
to
receive
injury
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
the
clock
had
struck
ten
the
ladies
all
went
away
to
their
beds
.
  
<EOS>
Lizzie
,
when
she
was
in
her
own
room
,
of
course
found
her
maid
waiting
for
her
.
<EOS>
It
was
necessarily
part
of
the
religion
of
such
a
woman
as
Lizzie
Eustace
that
she
could
not
go
to
bed
,
or
change
her
clothes
,
or
get
up
in
the
morning
,
without
the
assistance
of
her
own
young
woman
.
<EOS>
She
would
not
like
to
have
it
thought
that
she
could
stick
a
pin
into
her
own
belongings
without
such
assistance
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
it
was
often
the
case
with
her
,
that
she
was
anxious
to
get
rid
of
her
girl
's
attendance
.
<EOS>
It
had
been
so
on
this
morning
,
and
before
dinner
,
and
was
so
now
again
.
<EOS>
She
was
secret
in
her
movements
,
and
always
had
some
recess
in
her
boxes
and
bags
and
dressing
apparatuses
to
which
she
did
not
choose
that
Miss
Patience
Crabstick
should
have
access
.
<EOS>
She
was
careful
about
her
letters
,
and
very
careful
about
her
money
.
<EOS>
And
then
as
to
that
iron
box
in
which
the
diamonds
were
kept
!
<EOS>
Patience
Crabstick
had
never
yet
seen
the
inside
of
it
.
<EOS>
Moreover
,
it
may
be
said
,
 
either
on
Lizzie
's
behalf
or
to
her
discredit
,
as
the
reader
may
be
pleased
to
take
it
,
 
that
she
was
quite
able
to
dress
herself
,
to
brush
her
own
hair
,
to
take
off
her
own
clothes
;
and
that
she
was
not
,
either
by
nature
or
education
,
an
incapable
young
woman
.
<EOS>
But
that
honour
and
glory
demanded
it
,
she
would
almost
as
lief
have
had
no
Patience
Crabstick
to
pry
into
her
most
private
matters
.
<EOS>
All
which
Crabstick
knew
,
and
would
often
declare
her
missus
to
be
"
of
all
missuses
the
most
slyest
and
least
<EOS>
come
-
at
-
able
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
On
this
present
night
she
was
very
soon
despatched
to
her
own
chamber
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
,
however
,
took
one
careful
look
at
the
iron
box
before
the
girl
was
sent
away
.
  
<EOS>
Crabstick
,
on
this
occasion
,
had
not
far
to
go
to
seek
her
own
couch
.
<EOS>
Alongside
of
Lizzie
's
larger
chamber
there
was
a
small
room
,
 
a
dressing
-
room
with
a
bed
in
it
,
which
,
for
this
night
,
was
devoted
to
Crabstick
's
accommodation
.
<EOS>
Of
course
,
she
departed
from
attendance
on
her
mistress
by
the
door
which
opened
from
the
one
room
to
the
other
;
but
this
had
no
sooner
been
closed
than
Crabstick
descended
to
complete
the
amusements
of
the
evening
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
,
when
she
was
alone
,
bolted
both
the
doors
on
the
inside
,
and
then
quickly
retired
to
rest
.
<EOS>
Some
short
prayer
she
said
,
with
her
knees
close
to
the
iron
box
.
<EOS>
Then
she
put
certain
articles
of
property
under
her
pillow
,
 
her
watch
and
chain
,
and
the
rings
from
her
fingers
,
and
a
packet
which
she
had
drawn
from
her
travelling
-
desk
,
 
and
was
soon
in
bed
,
thinking
that
,
as
she
fell
away
to
sleep
,
she
would
revolve
in
her
mind
that
question
of
the
Corsair
;
 
<EOS>
would
it
be
good
to
trust
herself
and
all
her
belongings
to
one
who
might
perhaps
take
her
belongings
away
,
but
leave
herself
behind
?
<EOS>
The
subject
was
not
unpleasant
,
and
while
she
was
considering
it
,
she
fell
asleep
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
,
perhaps
,
about
two
in
the
morning
when
a
man
,
very
efficient
at
the
trade
which
he
was
then
following
,
knelt
outside
Lady
Eustace
's
door
,
and
,
with
a
delicately
-
made
saw
,
aided
,
probably
,
by
some
other
equally
well
-
finished
tools
,
absolutely
cut
out
that
portion
of
the
bedroom
door
on
which
the
bolt
was
fastened
.
<EOS>
He
must
have
known
the
spot
exactly
,
for
he
did
not
doubt
a
moment
as
he
commenced
his
work
;
and
yet
there
was
nothing
on
the
exterior
of
the
door
to
show
where
the
bolt
was
placed
.
<EOS>
The
bit
was
cut
out
without
the
slightest
noise
,
and
then
,
when
the
door
was
opened
,
was
placed
,
just
inside
,
upon
the
floor
.
<EOS>
The
man
then
with
perfectly
noiseless
step
entered
the
room
,
knelt
again
,
 
just
where
poor
Lizzie
had
knelt
as
she
said
her
prayers
,
 
so
that
he
might
the
more
easily
raise
the
iron
box
without
a
struggle
,
and
left
the
room
with
it
in
his
arms
without
disturbing
the
lovely
sleeper
.
<EOS>
He
then
descended
the
stairs
,
passed
into
the
coffee
-
room
at
the
bottom
of
them
,
and
handed
the
box
through
an
open
window
to
a
man
who
was
crouching
on
the
outside
in
the
dark
.
<EOS>
He
then
followed
the
box
,
pulled
down
the
window
,
put
on
a
pair
of
boots
which
his
friend
had
ready
for
him
;
and
the
two
,
after
lingering
a
few
moments
in
the
shade
of
the
dark
wall
,
retreated
with
their
prize
round
a
corner
.
<EOS>
The
night
itself
was
almost
pitch
-
dark
,
and
very
wet
.
<EOS>
It
was
as
nearly
black
with
darkness
as
a
night
can
be
.
<EOS>
So
far
,
the
enterprising
adventurers
had
been
successful
,
and
we
will
now
leave
them
in
their
chosen
retreat
,
engaged
on
the
longer
operation
of
forcing
open
the
iron
safe
.
<EOS>
For
it
had
been
arranged
between
them
that
the
iron
safe
should
be
opened
then
and
there
.
<EOS>
Though
the
weight
to
him
who
had
taken
it
out
of
Lizzie
's
room
had
not
been
oppressive
,
as
it
had
oppressed
the
tall
serving
-
man
,
it
might
still
have
been
an
encumbrance
to
gentlemen
intending
to
travel
by
railway
with
as
little
observation
as
possible
.
<EOS>
They
were
,
however
,
well
supplied
with
tools
,
and
we
will
leave
them
at
their
work
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
next
morning
Lizzie
was
awakened
earlier
than
she
had
expected
,
and
found
,
not
only
Patience
Crabstick
in
her
bedroom
,
but
also
a
chambermaid
,
and
the
wife
of
the
manager
of
the
hotel
.
<EOS>
The
story
was
soon
told
to
her
.
<EOS>
Her
room
had
been
broken
open
,
and
her
treasure
was
gone
.
<EOS>
The
party
had
intended
to
breakfast
at
their
leisure
,
and
proceed
to
London
by
a
train
leaving
Carlisle
in
the
middle
of
the
day
;
but
they
were
soon
disturbed
from
their
rest
.
<EOS>
Lady
Eustace
had
hardly
time
to
get
her
slippers
on
her
feet
,
and
to
wrap
herself
in
her
dressing
-
gown
,
to
get
rid
of
her
dishevelled
nightcap
,
and
make
herself
just
fit
for
public
view
,
before
the
manager
of
the
hotel
,
and
Lord
George
,
and
the
tall
footman
,
and
the
boots
were
in
her
bedroom
.
<EOS>
It
was
too
plainly
manifest
to
them
all
that
the
diamonds
were
gone
.
<EOS>
The
superintendent
of
the
Carlisle
police
was
there
almost
as
soon
as
the
others
;
 
and
following
him
very
quickly
came
the
important
gentleman
who
was
the
head
of
the
constabulary
of
the
county
.
  
<EOS>
Lizzie
,
when
she
first
heard
the
news
,
was
awe
-
struck
,
rather
than
outwardly
demonstrative
of
grief
.
<EOS>
"
There
has
been
a
regular
plot
,
"
said
Lord
George
.
<EOS>
Captain
Fitzmaurice
,
the
gallant
chief
,
nodded
his
head
.
<EOS>
"
Plot
enough
,
"
said
the
superintendent
,
 
who
did
not
mean
to
confide
his
thoughts
to
any
man
,
or
to
exempt
any
human
being
from
his
suspicion
.
<EOS>
The
manager
of
the
hotel
was
very
angry
,
and
at
first
did
not
restrain
his
anger
.
<EOS>
Did
not
everybody
know
that
if
articles
of
value
were
brought
into
an
hotel
they
should
be
handed
over
to
the
safe
-
keeping
of
the
manager
?
<EOS>
He
almost
seemed
to
think
that
Lizzie
had
stolen
her
own
box
of
diamonds
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
fellow
,
"
said
Lord
George
,
"
nobody
is
saying
a
word
against
you
,
or
your
house
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
my
lord
;
 
but
 
"
  
"
Lady
Eustace
is
not
blaming
you
,
and
do
not
you
blame
anybody
else
,
"
said
Lord
George
.
<EOS>
"
Let
the
police
do
what
is
right
.
"
  
<EOS>
At
last
the
men
retreated
,
and
Lizzie
was
left
with
Patience
and
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
<EOS>
But
even
then
she
did
not
give
way
to
her
grief
,
but
sat
upon
the
bed
awe
-
struck
and
mute
.
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
I
had
better
get
dressed
,
"
she
said
at
last
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
feared
how
it
might
be
,
"
said
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
holding
Lizzie
's
hand
affectionately
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
 
you
said
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
prize
was
so
great
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
always
was
a
-
telling
my
lady
 
"
began
Crabstick
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hold
your
tongue
!
"
said
Lizzie
angrily
.
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
the
police
will
do
the
best
they
can
,
Mrs.
Carbuncle
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
yes
;
 
and
so
will
Lord
George
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
'll
lie
down
again
for
a
little
while
,
"
said
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
"
I
feel
so
sick
I
hardly
know
what
to
do
.
<EOS>
If
I
were
to
lie
down
for
a
little
I
should
be
better
.
"
<EOS>
With
much
difficulty
she
got
them
to
leave
her
.
<EOS>
Then
,
before
she
again
undressed
herself
,
she
bolted
the
door
that
still
had
a
bolt
,
and
turned
the
lock
in
the
other
.
<EOS>
Having
done
this
,
she
took
out
from
under
her
pillow
the
little
parcel
which
had
been
in
her
desk
,
 
and
,
untying
it
,
perceived
that
her
dear
diamond
necklace
was
perfect
,
and
quite
safe
.
  
<EOS>
The
enterprising
adventurers
had
,
indeed
,
stolen
the
iron
case
,
but
they
had
stolen
nothing
else
.
<EOS>
The
reader
must
not
suppose
that
because
Lizzie
had
preserved
her
jewels
,
she
was
therefore
a
consenting
party
to
the
abstraction
of
the
box
.
<EOS>
The
theft
had
been
a
genuine
theft
,
planned
with
great
skill
,
carried
out
with
much
ingenuity
,
one
in
the
perpetration
of
which
money
had
been
spent
,
 
a
theft
which
for
a
while
baffled
the
police
of
England
,
and
which
was
supposed
to
be
very
creditable
to
those
who
had
been
engaged
in
it
.
<EOS>
But
the
box
,
and
nothing
but
the
box
,
had
fallen
into
the
hands
of
the
thieves
.
  
<EOS>
Lizzie
's
silence
when
the
abstraction
of
the
box
was
made
known
to
her
,
 
her
silence
as
to
the
fact
that
the
necklace
was
at
that
moment
within
the
grasp
of
her
own
fingers
<EOS>
,
 
was
not
at
first
the
effect
of
deliberate
fraud
.
<EOS>
She
was
ashamed
to
tell
them
that
she
brought
the
box
empty
from
Portray
,
having
the
diamonds
in
her
own
keeping
because
she
had
feared
that
the
box
might
be
stolen
.
<EOS>
And
then
it
occurred
to
her
,
quick
as
thought
could
flash
,
that
it
might
be
well
that
Mr.
Camperdown
should
be
made
to
believe
that
they
had
been
stolen
.
<EOS>
And
so
she
kept
her
secret
.
<EOS>
The
reflections
of
the
next
half
-
hour
told
her
how
very
great
would
now
be
her
difficulties
.
<EOS>
But
,
as
she
had
not
disclosed
the
truth
at
first
,
she
could
hardly
disclose
it
now
.
   
<EOS>
The
Journey
to
London
 
<EOS>
When
we
left
Lady
Eustace
alone
in
her
bedroom
at
the
Carlisle
hotel
after
the
discovery
of
the
robbery
,
she
had
very
many
cares
upon
her
mind
.
<EOS>
The
necklace
was
,
indeed
,
safe
under
her
pillow
in
the
bed
;
but
when
all
the
people
were
around
her
,
 
her
own
friends
,
and
the
police
,
and
they
who
were
concerned
with
the
inn
,
 
<EOS>
she
had
not
told
them
that
it
was
so
,
but
had
allowed
them
to
leave
her
with
the
belief
that
the
diamonds
had
gone
with
the
box
.
<EOS>
Even
at
this
moment
,
as
she
knew
well
,
steps
were
being
taken
to
discover
the
thieves
,
and
to
make
public
the
circumstances
of
the
robbery
.
<EOS>
Already
,
no
doubt
,
the
fact
that
her
chamber
had
been
entered
in
the
night
,
and
her
jewel
-
box
withdrawn
,
was
known
to
the
London
police
officers
.
<EOS>
In
such
circumstances
how
could
she
now
tell
the
truth
?
<EOS>
But
it
might
be
that
already
had
the
thieves
been
taken
.
<EOS>
In
that
case
would
not
the
truth
be
known
,
even
though
she
should
not
tell
it
?
<EOS>
Then
she
thought
for
a
while
that
she
would
get
rid
of
the
diamonds
altogether
,
so
that
no
one
should
know
aught
of
them
.
<EOS>
If
she
could
only
think
of
a
place
fit
for
such
purpose
she
would
so
hide
them
that
no
human
ingenuity
could
discover
them
.
<EOS>
Let
the
thieves
say
what
they
might
,
her
word
would
,
in
such
case
,
be
better
than
that
of
the
thieves
.
<EOS>
She
would
declare
that
the
jewels
had
been
in
the
box
when
the
box
was
taken
.
<EOS>
The
thieves
would
swear
that
the
box
had
been
empty
.
<EOS>
She
would
appeal
to
the
absence
of
the
diamonds
,
and
the
thieves
,
 
who
would
be
known
as
thieves
,
 
would
be
supposed
,
even
by
their
own
friends
and
associates
,
to
have
disposed
of
the
diamonds
before
they
had
been
taken
.
<EOS>
There
would
be
a
mystery
in
all
this
,
and
a
cunning
cleverness
,
the
idea
of
which
had
in
itself
a
certain
charm
for
Lizzie
Eustace
.
<EOS>
She
would
have
all
the
world
at
a
loss
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Camperdown
could
do
nothing
further
to
harass
her
;
and
would
have
been
,
so
far
,
overcome
.
<EOS>
She
would
be
saved
from
the
feeling
of
public
defeat
in
the
affair
of
the
necklace
,
which
would
be
very
dreadful
to
her
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
might
probably
be
again
at
her
feet
.
<EOS>
And
in
all
the
fuss
and
rumour
which
such
an
affair
would
make
in
London
,
there
would
be
nothing
of
which
she
need
be
ashamed
.
<EOS>
She
liked
the
idea
,
and
she
had
grown
to
be
very
sick
of
the
necklace
.
  
<EOS>
But
what
should
she
do
with
it
?
<EOS>
It
was
,
at
this
moment
,
between
her
fingers
beneath
the
pillow
.
<EOS>
If
she
were
minded
,
 
<EOS>
and
she
thought
she
was
so
minded
,
 
to
get
rid
of
it
altogether
<EOS>
,
the
sea
would
be
the
place
.
<EOS>
Could
she
make
up
her
mind
absolutely
to
destroy
so
large
a
property
,
it
would
be
best
for
her
to
have
recourse
to
"
her
own
broad
waves
,
"
as
she
called
them
even
to
herself
.
<EOS>
It
was
within
the
"
friendly
depths
of
her
own
rock
-
girt
ocean
"
that
she
should
find
a
grave
for
her
great
trouble
.
<EOS>
But
now
her
back
was
to
the
sea
,
and
she
could
hardly
insist
on
returning
to
Portray
without
exciting
a
suspicion
that
might
be
fatal
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
And
then
might
it
not
be
possible
to
get
altogether
quit
of
the
diamonds
and
yet
to
retain
the
power
of
future
possession
?
<EOS>
She
knew
that
she
was
running
into
debt
,
and
that
money
would
,
some
day
,
be
much
needed
.
<EOS>
Her
acquaintance
with
Mr.
Benjamin
,
the
jeweller
,
was
a
fact
often
present
to
her
mind
.
<EOS>
She
might
not
be
able
to
get
ten
thousand
pounds
from
Mr.
Benjamin
;
 
but
if
she
could
get
eight
,
or
six
,
or
even
five
,
how
pleasant
would
it
be
!
<EOS>
If
she
could
put
away
the
diamonds
for
three
or
four
years
,
 
if
she
could
so
hide
them
that
no
human
eyes
could
see
them
till
she
should
again
produce
them
to
the
light
,
 
surely
,
after
so
long
an
interval
,
they
might
be
made
available
!
<EOS>
But
where
should
be
found
such
hiding
-
place
?
<EOS>
She
understood
well
how
great
was
the
peril
while
the
necklace
was
in
her
own
immediate
keeping
.
<EOS>
Any
accident
might
discover
it
,
and
if
the
slightest
suspicion
were
aroused
,
the
police
would
come
upon
her
with
violence
and
discover
it
.
<EOS>
But
surely
there
must
be
some
such
hiding
-
place
,
 
if
only
she
could
think
of
it
!
<EOS>
Then
her
mind
reverted
to
all
the
stories
she
had
ever
heard
of
mysterious
villanies
.
<EOS>
There
must
be
some
way
of
accomplishing
this
thing
,
if
she
could
only
bring
her
mind
to
work
upon
it
exclusively
.
<EOS>
A
hole
dug
deep
into
the
ground
;
 
would
not
that
be
the
place
?
<EOS>
But
then
,
where
should
the
hole
be
dug
?
<EOS>
In
what
spot
should
she
trust
the
earth
?
<EOS>
If
anywhere
,
it
must
be
at
Portray
.
<EOS>
But
now
she
was
going
from
Portray
to
London
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
to
her
to
be
certain
that
she
could
dig
no
hole
in
London
that
would
be
secret
to
herself
.
<EOS>
Nor
could
she
trust
herself
,
during
the
hour
or
two
that
remained
to
her
,
to
find
such
a
hole
in
Carlisle
.
  
<EOS>
What
she
wanted
was
a
friend
;
 
some
one
that
she
could
trust
.
<EOS>
But
she
had
no
such
friend
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
dare
to
give
the
jewels
up
to
Lord
George
.
<EOS>
So
tempted
,
would
not
any
Corsair
appropriate
the
treasure
?
<EOS>
And
if
,
as
might
be
possible
,
she
were
mistaken
about
him
and
he
was
no
Corsair
,
then
would
he
betray
her
to
the
police
?
<EOS>
She
thought
of
all
her
dearest
friends
,
 
Frank
Greystock
,
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
Lucinda
,
Miss
Macnulty
,
 
even
of
Patience
Crabstick
,
 
but
there
was
no
friend
whom
she
could
trust
.
<EOS>
Whatever
she
did
she
must
do
alone
!
<EOS>
She
began
to
fear
that
the
load
of
thought
required
would
be
more
than
she
could
bear
.
<EOS>
One
thing
,
however
,
was
certain
to
her
;
 
she
could
not
now
venture
to
tell
them
all
that
the
necklace
was
in
her
possession
,
and
that
the
stolen
box
had
been
empty
.
  
<EOS>
Thinking
of
all
this
,
she
went
to
sleep
,
 
still
holding
the
packet
tight
between
her
fingers
,
 
and
in
this
position
was
awakened
at
about
ten
by
a
knock
at
the
door
from
her
friend
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
jumped
out
of
bed
,
and
admitted
her
friend
,
admitting
also
Patience
Crabstick
.
<EOS>
"
You
had
better
get
up
now
,
dear
,
"
said
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
<EOS>
"
We
are
all
going
to
breakfast
.
"
<EOS>
Lizzie
declared
herself
to
be
so
fluttered
,
that
she
must
have
her
breakfast
up
-
stairs
.
<EOS>
No
one
was
to
wait
for
her
.
<EOS>
Crabstick
would
go
down
and
fetch
for
her
a
cup
of
tea
,
 
and
just
a
morsel
of
something
to
eat
.
<EOS>
"
You
ca
n't
be
surprised
that
I
should
n't
be
quite
myself
,
"
said
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
's
surprise
did
not
run
at
all
in
that
direction
.
<EOS>
Both
Mrs.
Carbuncle
and
Lord
George
had
been
astonished
to
find
how
well
she
bore
her
loss
.
<EOS>
Lord
George
gave
her
credit
for
real
bravery
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
suggested
,
in
a
whisper
,
that
perhaps
she
regarded
the
theft
as
an
easy
way
out
of
a
lawsuit
.
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
you
know
,
George
,
they
would
have
got
it
from
her
.
"
<EOS>
Then
Lord
George
whistled
,
and
,
in
another
whisper
,
declared
that
,
if
the
little
adventure
had
all
been
arranged
by
Lady
Eustace
herself
with
the
view
of
getting
the
better
of
Mr.
Camperdown
,
his
respect
for
that
lady
would
be
very
greatly
raised
.
<EOS>
"
If
,
"
said
Lord
George
,
"
it
turns
out
that
she
has
had
a
couple
of
bravos
in
her
pay
,
like
an
old
Italian
marquis
,
I
shall
think
very
highly
of
her
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
This
had
occurred
before
Mrs.
Carbuncle
came
up
to
Lizzie
's
room
;
 
but
neither
of
them
for
a
moment
suspected
that
the
necklace
was
still
within
the
hotel
.
  
<EOS>
The
box
had
been
found
,
and
a
portion
of
the
fragments
were
brought
into
the
room
while
the
party
were
still
at
breakfast
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
was
not
in
the
room
,
but
the
news
was
at
once
taken
up
to
her
by
Crabstick
,
together
with
a
pheasant
's
wing
and
some
buttered
toast
.
<EOS>
In
a
recess
beneath
an
archway
running
under
the
railroad
,
not
distant
from
the
hotel
above
a
hundred
and
fifty
yards
,
the
iron
box
had
been
found
.
<EOS>
It
had
been
forced
open
,
so
said
the
sergeant
of
police
,
with
tools
of
the
finest
steel
,
peculiarly
made
for
such
purpose
.
<EOS>
The
sergeant
of
police
was
quite
sure
that
the
thing
had
been
done
by
London
men
who
were
at
the
very
top
of
their
trade
.
<EOS>
It
was
manifest
that
nothing
had
been
spared
.
<EOS>
Every
motion
of
the
party
must
have
been
known
to
them
,
and
probably
one
of
the
adventurers
had
travelled
in
the
same
train
with
them
.
<EOS>
And
the
very
doors
of
the
bedroom
in
the
hotel
had
been
measured
by
the
man
who
had
cut
out
the
bolt
.
<EOS>
The
sergeant
of
police
was
almost
lost
in
admiration
;
 
but
the
superintendent
of
police
,
whom
Lord
George
saw
more
than
once
,
was
discreet
and
silent
.
<EOS>
To
the
superintendent
of
police
it
was
by
no
means
sure
that
Lord
George
himself
might
not
be
fond
of
diamonds
.
<EOS>
Of
a
suspicion
flying
so
delightfully
high
as
this
,
he
breathed
no
word
to
any
one
;
but
simply
suggested
that
he
should
like
to
retain
the
companionship
of
one
of
the
party
.
<EOS>
If
Lady
Eustace
could
dispense
with
the
services
of
the
tall
footman
,
the
tall
footman
might
be
found
useful
at
Carlisle
.
<EOS>
It
was
arranged
,
therefore
,
that
the
tall
footman
should
remain
;
 
and
the
tall
footman
did
remain
,
though
not
with
his
own
consent
.
  
<EOS>
The
whole
party
,
including
Lady
Eustace
herself
and
Patience
Crabstick
,
were
called
upon
to
give
their
evidence
to
the
Carlisle
magistrates
before
they
could
proceed
to
London
.
<EOS>
This
Lizzie
did
,
having
the
necklace
at
that
moment
locked
up
in
her
desk
at
the
inn
.
<EOS>
The
diamonds
were
supposed
to
be
worth
ten
thousand
pounds
.
<EOS>
There
was
to
be
a
lawsuit
about
them
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
for
a
moment
doubt
that
they
were
her
property
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
very
careful
about
the
diamonds
because
of
the
lawsuit
.
<EOS>
Fearing
that
Mr.
Camperdown
might
wrest
them
from
her
possession
,
she
had
caused
the
iron
box
to
be
made
.
<EOS>
She
had
last
seen
the
diamonds
on
the
evening
before
her
departure
from
Portray
.
<EOS>
She
had
then
herself
locked
them
up
,
and
she
now
produced
the
key
.
<EOS>
The
lock
was
still
so
far
uninjured
that
the
key
would
turn
it
.
<EOS>
That
was
her
evidence
.
<EOS>
Crabstick
,
with
a
good
deal
of
reticence
,
supported
her
mistress
.
<EOS>
She
had
seen
the
diamonds
,
no
doubt
,
but
had
not
seen
them
often
.
<EOS>
She
had
seen
them
down
at
Portray
,
but
not
for
ever
so
long
.
<EOS>
Crabstick
had
very
little
to
say
about
them
;
but
the
clever
superintendent
was
by
no
means
sure
that
Crabstick
did
not
know
more
than
she
said
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
and
Lord
George
had
also
seen
the
diamonds
at
Portray
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
doubt
whatever
as
to
the
diamonds
having
been
in
the
iron
box
;
 
nor
was
there
,
said
Lord
George
,
any
doubt
but
that
this
special
necklace
had
acquired
so
much
public
notice
from
the
fact
of
the
threatened
lawsuit
,
as
might
make
its
circumstances
and
value
known
to
London
thieves
.
<EOS>
The
tall
footman
was
not
examined
,
but
was
detained
by
the
police
under
a
remand
given
by
the
magistrates
.
  
<EOS>
Much
information
as
to
what
had
been
done
oozed
out
in
spite
of
the
precautions
of
the
discreet
superintendent
.
<EOS>
The
wires
had
been
put
into
operation
in
every
direction
,
and
it
had
been
discovered
that
one
man
whom
nobody
knew
had
left
the
down
mail
train
at
Annan
,
and
another
at
Dumfries
.
<EOS>
These
men
had
taken
tickets
by
the
train
leaving
Carlisle
between
four
and
five
a.m.
,
and
were
supposed
to
have
been
the
two
thieves
.
<EOS>
It
had
been
nearly
seven
before
the
theft
had
been
discovered
,
and
by
that
time
not
only
had
the
men
reached
the
towns
named
,
but
had
had
time
to
make
their
way
back
again
or
farther
on
into
Scotland
.
<EOS>
At
any
rate
,
for
the
present
,
all
trace
of
them
was
lost
.
<EOS>
The
sergeant
of
police
did
not
doubt
but
that
one
of
these
men
was
making
his
way
up
to
London
with
the
necklace
in
his
pocket
.
<EOS>
This
was
told
to
Lizzie
by
Lord
George
;
and
though
she
was
awe
-
struck
by
the
danger
of
her
situation
,
she
nevertheless
did
feel
some
satisfaction
in
remembering
that
she
and
she
only
held
the
key
of
the
mystery
.
<EOS>
And
then
as
to
those
poor
thieves
!
<EOS>
What
must
have
been
their
consternation
when
they
found
,
after
all
the
labour
and
perils
of
the
night
,
that
the
box
contained
no
diamonds
,
 
that
the
treasure
was
not
there
,
and
that
they
were
nevertheless
bound
to
save
themselves
by
flight
and
stratagem
from
the
hands
of
the
police
!
<EOS>
Lizzie
,
as
she
thought
of
this
,
almost
pitied
the
poor
thieves
.
<EOS>
What
a
consternation
there
would
be
among
the
Camperdowns
and
Garnetts
,
among
the
Mopuses
and
Benjamins
,
when
the
news
was
heard
in
London
!
<EOS>
Lizzie
almost
enjoyed
it
.
<EOS>
As
her
mind
went
on
making
fresh
schemes
on
the
subject
,
a
morbid
desire
of
increasing
the
mystery
took
possession
of
her
.
<EOS>
She
was
quite
sure
that
nobody
knew
her
secret
,
and
that
nobody
as
yet
could
even
guess
it
.
<EOS>
There
was
great
danger
,
but
there
might
be
delight
and
even
profit
if
she
could
safely
dispose
of
the
jewels
before
suspicion
against
herself
should
be
aroused
.
<EOS>
She
could
understand
that
a
rumour
should
get
to
the
police
that
the
box
had
been
empty
,
even
if
the
thieves
were
not
taken
;
 
but
such
rumour
would
avail
nothing
if
she
could
only
dispose
of
the
diamonds
.
<EOS>
As
she
first
thought
of
all
this
,
the
only
plan
hitherto
suggested
to
herself
would
require
her
immediate
return
to
Portray
.
<EOS>
If
she
were
at
Portray
she
could
find
a
spot
in
which
she
could
bury
the
necklace
.
<EOS>
But
she
was
obliged
to
allow
herself
now
to
be
hurried
up
to
London
.
<EOS>
When
she
got
into
the
train
the
little
parcel
was
in
her
desk
,
and
the
key
of
her
desk
was
fastened
round
her
neck
.
  
<EOS>
They
had
secured
a
compartment
for
themselves
from
Carlisle
to
London
,
and
of
course
filled
four
seats
.
<EOS>
"
As
I
am
alive
,
"
said
Lord
George
as
soon
as
the
train
had
left
the
station
,
"
that
head
policeman
thinks
that
I
am
the
thief
!
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
laughed
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
protested
that
this
was
absurd
.
<EOS>
Lucinda
declared
that
such
a
suspicion
would
be
vastly
amusing
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
fact
,
"
continued
Lord
George
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
see
it
in
the
fellow
's
eye
,
and
I
feel
it
to
be
a
compliment
.
<EOS>
They
are
so
very
"
cute
that
they
delight
in
suspicions
.
<EOS>
I
remember
,
when
the
altar
-
plate
was
stolen
from
Barchester
Cathedral
some
years
ago
,
a
splendid
idea
occurred
to
one
of
the
police
,
that
the
Bishop
had
taken
it
!
"
  
"
<EOS>
Really
?
"
asked
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
yes
;
 
really
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
doubt
but
that
there
is
already
a
belief
in
some
of
their
minds
that
you
have
stolen
your
own
diamonds
for
the
sake
of
getting
the
better
of
Mr.
Camperdown
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
But
what
could
I
do
with
them
if
I
had
?
"
asked
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sell
them
,
of
course
.
<EOS>
There
is
always
a
market
for
such
goods
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
But
who
would
buy
them
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
have
been
so
clever
,
Lady
Eustace
,
I
'll
find
a
purchaser
for
them
.
<EOS>
One
would
have
to
go
a
good
distance
to
do
it
,
 
and
there
would
be
some
expense
.
<EOS>
But
the
thing
could
be
done
.
<EOS>
Vienna
,
I
should
think
,
would
be
about
the
place
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Very
well
,
then
,
"
said
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
"
You
wo
n't
be
surprised
if
I
ask
you
to
take
the
journey
for
me
.
<EOS>
"
Then
they
all
laughed
,
and
were
very
much
amused
.
<EOS>
It
was
quite
agreed
among
them
that
Lizzie
bore
her
loss
very
well
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
n't
care
the
least
for
losing
them
,
"
said
Lizzie
,
 
"
only
that
Florian
gave
them
to
me
.
<EOS>
They
have
been
such
a
vexation
to
me
that
to
be
without
them
will
be
a
comfort
.
"
<EOS>
Her
desk
had
been
brought
into
the
carriage
and
was
now
used
as
a
foot
-
stool
in
place
of
the
box
which
was
gone
.
  
<EOS>
They
arrived
at
Mrs.
Carbuncle
's
house
in
Hertford
Street
quite
late
,
between
ten
and
eleven
;
 
but
a
note
had
been
sent
from
Lizzie
to
her
cousin
Frank
's
address
from
the
Euston
Square
station
by
a
commissionaire
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
two
notes
were
sent
,
 
one
to
the
House
of
Commons
,
and
the
other
to
the
Grosvenor
Hotel
.
<EOS>
"
My
necklace
has
been
stolen
.
<EOS>
Come
to
me
early
to
-
morrow
at
Mrs.
Carbuncle
's
house
,
<EOS>
No
.
 
,
Hertford
Street
.
<EOS>
"
And
he
did
come
,
 
before
Lizzie
was
up
.
<EOS>
Crabstick
brought
her
mistress
word
that
Mr.
Greystock
was
in
the
parlour
soon
after
nine
o'clock
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
again
hurried
on
her
clothes
so
that
she
might
see
her
cousin
,
taking
care
as
she
did
so
that
though
her
toilet
might
betray
haste
,
it
should
not
be
other
than
charming
.
<EOS>
And
as
she
dressed
she
endeavoured
to
come
to
some
conclusion
.
<EOS>
Would
it
not
be
best
for
her
that
she
should
tell
everything
to
her
cousin
,
and
throw
herself
upon
his
mercy
,
trusting
to
his
ingenuity
to
extricate
her
from
her
difficulties
?
<EOS>
She
had
been
thinking
of
her
position
almost
through
the
entire
night
,
and
had
remembered
that
at
Carlisle
she
had
committed
perjury
.
<EOS>
She
had
sworn
that
the
diamonds
had
been
left
by
her
in
the
box
.
<EOS>
And
should
they
be
found
with
her
<EOS>
it
might
be
that
they
would
put
her
in
gaol
for
stealing
them
.
<EOS>
Little
mercy
could
she
expect
from
Mr.
Camperdown
<EOS>
should
she
fall
into
that
gentleman
's
hands
!
<EOS>
But
Frank
,
if
she
would
even
yet
tell
him
everything
honestly
,
might
probably
save
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
this
about
the
diamonds
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
as
soon
as
he
saw
her
.
<EOS>
She
had
flown
almost
into
his
arms
as
though
carried
there
by
the
excitement
of
the
moment
.
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
really
mean
that
they
have
been
stolen
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
,
Frank
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
On
the
journey
?
"
  
"
Yes
,
Frank
;
 
at
the
inn
at
Carlisle
.
"
  
"
Box
and
all
?
"
Then
she
told
him
the
whole
story
;
 
not
the
true
story
,
but
the
story
as
it
was
believed
by
all
the
world
.
<EOS>
She
found
it
to
be
impossible
to
tell
him
the
true
story
.
"
<EOS>
And
the
box
was
broken
open
,
and
left
in
the
street
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Under
an
archway
,
"
said
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
do
the
police
think
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
what
they
think
.
<EOS>
Lord
George
says
that
they
believe
he
is
the
thief
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
knew
of
them
,
"
said
Frank
,
as
though
he
imagined
that
the
suggestion
was
not
altogether
absurd
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
yes
;
 
he
knew
of
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
what
is
to
be
done
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
.
<EOS>
I
've
sent
for
you
to
tell
me
.
"
<EOS>
Then
Frank
averred
that
information
should
be
immediately
given
to
Mr.
Camperdown
.
<EOS>
He
would
himself
call
on
Mr.
Camperdown
,
and
would
also
see
the
head
of
the
London
police
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
doubt
but
that
all
the
circumstances
were
already
known
in
London
at
the
police
office
;
 
but
it
might
be
well
that
he
should
see
the
officer
.
<EOS>
He
was
acquainted
with
the
gentleman
,
and
might
perhaps
learn
something
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
at
once
acceded
,
and
Frank
went
direct
to
Mr.
Camperdown
's
offices
.
<EOS>
"
If
I
had
lost
ten
thousand
pounds
in
that
way
,
"
said
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
"
I
think
I
should
have
broken
my
heart
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Lizzie
felt
that
her
heart
was
bursting
rather
than
being
broken
,
because
the
ten
thousand
pounds
"
worth
of
diamonds
was
not
really
lost
.
   
<EOS>
Lucy
Morris
in
Brook
Street
 
<EOS>
Lucy
Morris
went
to
Lady
Linlithgow
early
in
October
,
and
was
still
with
Lady
Linlithgow
when
Lizzie
Eustace
returned
to
London
in
January
.
<EOS>
During
these
three
months
she
certainly
had
not
been
happy
.
<EOS>
In
the
first
place
,
she
had
not
once
seen
her
lover
.
<EOS>
This
had
aroused
no
anger
or
suspicion
in
her
bosom
against
him
,
because
the
old
countess
had
told
her
that
she
would
have
no
lover
come
to
the
house
,
and
that
,
above
all
,
she
would
not
allow
a
young
man
with
whom
she
herself
was
connected
to
come
in
that
guise
to
her
companion
.
<EOS>
"
From
all
I
hear
,
"
said
Lady
Linlithgow
,
"
it
's
not
at
all
likely
to
be
a
match
;
 
and
at
any
rate
it
ca
n't
go
on
here
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Lucy
thought
that
she
would
be
doing
no
more
than
standing
up
properly
for
her
lover
by
asserting
her
conviction
that
it
would
be
a
match
;
 
and
she
did
assert
it
bravely
;
but
she
made
no
petition
for
his
presence
,
and
bore
that
trouble
bravely
.
<EOS>
In
the
next
place
,
Frank
was
not
a
satisfactory
correspondent
.
<EOS>
He
did
write
to
her
occasionally
;
 
and
he
wrote
also
to
the
old
countess
immediately
on
his
return
to
town
from
Bobsborough
a
letter
which
was
intended
as
an
answer
to
that
which
she
had
written
to
Mrs.
Greystock
.
<EOS>
What
was
said
in
that
letter
Lucy
never
knew
;
 
but
<EOS>
she
did
know
that
Frank
's
few
letters
to
herself
were
not
full
and
hearty
,
 
were
not
such
thorough
-
going
love
-
letters
as
lovers
write
to
each
other
when
they
feel
unlimited
satisfaction
in
the
work
.
<EOS>
She
excused
him
,
 
telling
herself
that
he
was
overworked
,
that
with
his
double
trade
of
legislator
and
lawyer
he
could
hardly
be
expected
to
write
letters
,
 
that
men
,
in
respect
of
letter
-
writing
,
are
not
as
women
are
,
and
the
like
;
but
still
there
grew
at
her
heart
a
little
weed
of
care
,
which
from
week
to
week
spread
its
noxious
,
heavy
-
scented
leaves
,
and
robbed
her
of
her
joyousness
.
<EOS>
To
be
loved
by
her
lover
,
and
to
feel
that
she
was
his
,
 
to
have
a
lover
of
her
own
to
whom
she
could
thoroughly
devote
herself
,
 
to
be
conscious
that
she
was
one
of
those
happy
women
in
the
world
who
find
a
mate
worthy
of
worship
as
well
as
love
,
 
this
to
her
was
so
great
a
joy
that
even
the
sadness
of
her
present
position
could
not
utterly
depress
her
.
<EOS>
From
day
to
day
she
assured
herself
that
she
did
not
doubt
and
would
not
doubt
,
 
that
there
was
no
cause
for
doubt
;
 
that
she
would
herself
be
base
were
she
to
admit
any
shadow
of
suspicion
.
<EOS>
But
yet
his
absence
,
 
and
the
shortness
of
those
little
notes
,
which
came
perhaps
once
a
fortnight
,
did
tell
upon
her
in
opposition
to
her
own
convictions
.
<EOS>
Each
note
as
it
came
was
answered
,
 
instantly
;
but
she
would
not
write
except
when
the
notes
came
.
<EOS>
She
would
not
seem
to
reproach
him
by
writing
oftener
than
he
wrote
.
<EOS>
When
he
had
given
her
so
much
,
and
she
had
nothing
but
her
confidence
to
give
in
return
,
would
she
stint
him
in
that
?
<EOS>
There
can
be
no
love
,
she
said
,
without
confidence
,
and
it
was
the
pride
of
her
heart
to
love
him
.
  
<EOS>
The
circumstances
of
her
present
life
were
desperately
weary
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
could
hardly
understand
why
it
was
that
Lady
Linlithgow
should
desire
her
presence
.
<EOS>
She
was
required
to
do
nothing
.
<EOS>
She
had
no
duties
to
perform
,
and
,
as
it
seemed
to
her
,
was
of
no
use
to
any
one
.
<EOS>
The
countess
would
not
even
allow
her
to
be
of
ordinary
service
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
Lady
Linlithgow
,
as
she
had
said
of
herself
,
poked
her
own
fires
,
carved
her
own
meat
,
lit
her
own
candles
,
opened
and
shut
the
doors
for
herself
,
wrote
her
own
letters
,
 
and
did
not
even
like
to
have
books
read
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
simply
chose
to
have
some
one
sitting
with
her
to
whom
she
could
speak
and
make
little
cross
-
grained
,
sarcastic
,
and
ill
-
natured
remarks
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
company
at
the
house
in
Brook
Street
,
and
when
the
countess
herself
went
out
,
she
went
out
alone
.
<EOS>
Even
when
she
had
a
cab
to
go
shopping
,
or
to
make
calls
,
she
rarely
asked
Lucy
to
go
with
her
,
 
and
was
benevolent
chiefly
in
this
,
 
that
if
Lucy
chose
to
walk
round
the
square
,
or
as
far
as
the
park
,
her
ladyship
's
maid
was
allowed
to
accompany
her
for
protection
.
<EOS>
Poor
Lucy
often
told
herself
that
such
a
life
would
be
unbearable
,
 
were
it
not
for
the
supreme
satisfaction
she
had
in
remembering
her
lover
.
<EOS>
And
then
the
arrangement
had
been
made
only
for
six
months
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
feel
quite
assured
of
her
fate
at
the
end
of
those
six
months
,
but
she
believed
that
there
would
come
to
her
a
residence
in
a
sort
of
outer
garden
to
that
sweet
Elysium
in
which
she
was
to
pass
her
life
.
<EOS>
The
Elysium
would
be
Frank
's
house
;
and
the
outer
garden
was
the
deanery
at
Bobsborough
.
  
<EOS>
Twice
during
the
three
months
Lady
Fawn
,
with
two
of
the
girls
,
came
to
call
upon
her
.
<EOS>
On
the
first
occasion
she
was
unluckily
out
,
taking
advantage
of
the
protection
of
her
ladyship
's
maid
in
getting
a
little
air
.
<EOS>
Lady
Linlithgow
had
also
been
away
,
and
Lady
Fawn
had
seen
no
one
.
<EOS>
Afterwards
,
both
Lucy
and
her
ladyship
were
found
at
home
,
and
Lady
Fawn
was
full
of
graciousness
and
affection
.
<EOS>
"
I
daresay
you
've
got
something
to
say
to
each
other
,
"
said
Lady
Linlithgow
,
"
and
I
'll
go
away
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Pray
do
n't
let
us
disturb
you
,
"
said
Lady
Fawn
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
'd
only
abuse
me
if
I
did
n't
,
"
said
Lady
Linlithgow
.
  
<EOS>
As
soon
as
she
was
gone
Lucy
rushed
into
her
friend
's
arms
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
so
nice
to
see
you
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
my
dear
,
is
n't
it
?
<EOS>
I
did
come
before
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
been
so
good
to
me
!
<EOS>
To
see
you
again
is
like
the
violets
and
primroses
.
<EOS>
"
She
was
crouching
close
to
Lady
Fawn
,
with
her
hand
in
that
of
her
friend
Lydia
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
n't
a
word
to
say
against
Lady
Linlithgow
,
but
it
is
like
winter
here
,
after
dear
Richmond
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
;
 
we
think
we
're
prettier
at
Richmond
,
"
said
Lady
Fawn
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
were
such
hundreds
of
things
to
do
there
,
"
said
Lucy
.
<EOS>
"
After
all
,
what
a
comfort
it
is
to
have
things
to
do
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
did
you
come
away
?
"
said
Lydia
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
was
obliged
.
<EOS>
You
must
n't
scold
me
now
that
you
have
come
to
see
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
There
were
a
hundred
things
to
be
said
about
Fawn
Court
and
the
children
,
and
a
hundred
more
things
about
Lady
Linlithgow
and
Bruton
Street
.
<EOS>
Then
,
at
last
,
Lady
Fawn
asked
the
one
important
question
.
"
<EOS>
And
now
,
my
dear
,
what
about
Mr.
Greystock
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
 
I
do
n't
know
;
 
nothing
particular
,
Lady
Fawn
.
<EOS>
It
's
just
as
it
was
,
and
I
am
 
quite
satisfied
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
see
him
sometimes
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
never
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
seen
him
since
the
last
time
he
came
down
to
Richmond
.
<EOS>
Lady
Linlithgow
does
n't
allow
 
followers
.
<EOS>
"
There
was
a
pleasant
little
spark
of
laughter
in
Lucy
's
eye
as
she
said
this
,
which
would
have
told
to
any
bystander
the
whole
story
of
the
affection
which
existed
between
her
and
Lady
Fawn
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
very
ill
-
natured
,
"
said
Lydia
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
he
's
a
sort
of
cousin
,
too
,
"
said
Lady
Fawn
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
just
the
reason
why
,
"
said
Lucy
,
explaining
.
<EOS>
"
Of
course
,
Lady
Linlithgow
thinks
that
her
sister
's
nephew
can
do
better
than
marry
her
companion
.
<EOS>
It
's
a
matter
of
course
she
should
think
so
.
<EOS>
What
I
am
most
afraid
of
is
that
the
dean
and
Mrs.
Greystock
should
think
so
too
.
"
  
<EOS>
No
doubt
the
dean
and
Mrs.
Greystock
would
think
so
;
 
Lady
Fawn
was
very
sure
of
that
.
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
was
one
of
the
best
women
breathing
,
 
unselfish
,
motherly
,
affectionate
,
appreciative
,
and
never
happy
unless
she
was
doing
good
to
somebody
.
<EOS>
It
was
her
nature
to
be
soft
,
and
kind
,
and
beneficent
.
<EOS>
But
she
knew
very
well
that
if
she
had
had
a
son
,
 
a
second
son
,
 
situated
as
was
Frank
Greystock
<EOS>
,
she
would
not
wish
him
to
marry
a
girl
without
a
penny
,
who
was
forced
to
earn
her
bread
by
being
a
governess
.
<EOS>
The
sacrifice
on
Mr.
Greystock
's
part
would
,
in
her
estimation
,
be
so
great
,
that
she
did
not
believe
that
it
would
be
made
.
<EOS>
Woman
-
like
,
she
regarded
the
man
as
being
so
much
more
important
than
the
woman
,
that
she
could
not
think
that
Frank
Greystock
would
devote
himself
simply
to
such
a
one
as
Lucy
Morris
.
<EOS>
Had
Lady
Fawn
been
asked
which
was
the
better
creature
of
the
two
,
her
late
governess
or
the
rising
barrister
who
had
declared
himself
to
be
that
governess
's
lover
<EOS>
,
she
would
have
said
that
no
man
could
be
better
than
Lucy
.
<EOS>
She
knew
Lucy
's
worth
and
goodness
so
well
that
she
was
ready
herself
to
do
any
act
of
friendship
on
behalf
of
one
so
sweet
and
excellent
.
<EOS>
For
herself
and
her
girls
Lucy
was
a
companion
and
friend
in
every
way
satisfactory
.
<EOS>
But
was
it
probable
that
a
man
of
the
world
,
such
as
was
<EOS>
Frank
Greystock
,
a
rising
man
,
a
member
of
Parliament
,
one
who
,
as
everybody
knew
,
was
especially
in
want
of
money
,
 
was
it
probable
that
such
a
man
as
this
would
make
her
his
wife
just
because
she
was
good
,
and
worthy
,
and
sweet
-
natured
?
<EOS>
No
doubt
the
man
had
said
that
he
would
do
so
,
 
and
Lady
Fawn
's
fears
betrayed
on
her
ladyship
's
part
a
very
bad
opinion
of
men
in
general
.
<EOS>
It
may
seem
to
be
a
paradox
to
assert
that
such
bad
opinion
sprung
from
the
high
idea
which
she
entertained
of
the
importance
of
men
in
general
;
 
but
it
was
so
.
<EOS>
She
had
but
one
son
,
and
of
all
her
children
he
was
the
least
worthy
;
but
he
was
more
important
to
her
than
all
her
daughters
.
<EOS>
Between
her
own
girls
and
Lucy
she
hardly
made
any
difference
;
 
but
when
her
son
had
chosen
to
quarrel
with
Lucy
it
had
been
necessary
to
send
Lucy
to
eat
her
meals
up
-
stairs
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
believe
that
Mr.
Greystock
should
think
so
much
of
such
a
little
girl
as
to
marry
her
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Greystock
would
no
doubt
behave
very
badly
in
not
doing
so
;
 
but
then
men
do
so
often
behave
very
badly
!
<EOS>
And
at
the
bottom
of
her
heart
she
almost
thought
that
they
might
be
excused
for
doing
so
.
<EOS>
According
to
her
view
of
things
,
a
man
out
in
the
world
had
so
many
things
to
think
of
,
and
was
so
very
important
,
that
he
could
hardly
be
expected
to
act
at
all
times
with
truth
and
sincerity
.
  
<EOS>
Lucy
had
suggested
that
the
dean
and
Mrs.
Greystock
would
dislike
the
marriage
,
and
upon
that
hint
Lady
Fawn
spoke
.
<EOS>
"
Nothing
is
settled
,
I
suppose
,
as
to
where
you
are
to
go
when
the
six
months
are
over
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nothing
as
yet
,
Lady
Fawn
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
have
n't
asked
you
to
go
to
Bobsborough
?
"
  
<EOS>
Lucy
would
have
given
the
world
not
to
blush
as
she
answered
,
but
she
did
blush
.
<EOS>
"
Nothing
is
fixed
,
Lady
Fawn
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Something
should
be
fixed
,
Lucy
.
<EOS>
It
should
be
settled
by
this
time
;
 
should
n't
it
,
dear
?
<EOS>
What
will
you
do
without
a
home
,
if
at
the
end
of
the
six
months
Lady
Linlithgow
should
say
that
she
does
n't
want
you
any
more
?
"
  
<EOS>
Lucy
certainly
did
not
look
forward
to
a
condition
in
which
Lady
Linlithgow
should
be
the
arbitress
of
her
destiny
.
<EOS>
The
idea
of
staying
with
the
countess
was
almost
as
bad
to
her
as
that
of
finding
herself
altogether
homeless
.
<EOS>
She
was
still
blushing
,
feeling
herself
to
be
hot
and
embarrassed
.
<EOS>
But
Lady
Fawn
sat
,
waiting
for
an
answer
.
<EOS>
To
Lucy
there
was
only
one
answer
possible
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
ask
Mr.
Greystock
what
I
am
to
do
.
"
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
shook
her
head
.
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
believe
in
Mr.
Greystock
,
Lady
Fawn
;
but
I
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
darling
girl
,
"
said
her
ladyship
,
making
the
special
speech
for
the
sake
of
making
which
she
had
travelled
up
from
Richmond
,
 
<EOS>
"
it
is
not
exactly
a
question
of
belief
,
but
one
of
common
prudence
.
<EOS>
No
girl
should
allow
herself
to
depend
on
a
man
before
she
is
married
to
him
.
<EOS>
By
doing
so
she
will
be
apt
to
lose
even
his
respect
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
mean
for
money
,
"
said
Lucy
,
hotter
than
ever
,
with
her
eyes
full
of
tears
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
should
not
be
in
any
respect
at
his
disposal
till
he
has
bound
himself
to
her
at
the
altar
.
<EOS>
You
may
believe
me
,
Lucy
,
when
I
tell
you
so
.
<EOS>
It
is
only
because
I
love
you
so
that
I
say
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
that
,
Lady
Fawn
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
When
your
time
here
is
over
,
just
put
up
your
things
and
come
back
to
Richmond
.
<EOS>
You
need
fear
nothing
with
us
.
<EOS>
Frederic
quite
liked
your
way
of
parting
with
him
at
last
,
and
all
that
little
affair
is
forgotten
.
<EOS>
At
Fawn
Court
you
'll
be
safe
;
 
and
you
shall
be
happy
,
too
,
if
we
can
make
you
happy
.
<EOS>
It
's
the
proper
place
for
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
you
'll
come
,
"
said
Diana
Fawn
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
'll
be
the
worst
little
thing
in
the
world
if
you
do
n't
,
"
said
Lydia
.
<EOS>
"
We
do
n't
know
what
to
do
without
you
.
<EOS>
Do
we
,
mamma
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Lucy
will
please
us
all
by
coming
back
to
her
old
home
,
"
said
Lady
Fawn
.
<EOS>
The
tears
were
now
streaming
down
Lucy
's
face
,
so
that
she
was
hardly
able
to
say
a
word
in
answer
to
all
this
kindness
.
<EOS>
And
she
did
not
know
what
word
to
say
.
<EOS>
Were
she
to
accept
the
offer
made
to
her
,
and
acknowledge
that
she
could
do
nothing
better
than
creep
back
under
her
old
friend
's
wing
,
 
would
she
not
thereby
be
showing
that
she
doubted
her
lover
?
<EOS>
And
yet
she
could
not
go
to
the
dean
's
house
unless
the
dean
and
his
wife
were
pleased
to
take
her
;
and
,
suspecting
as
she
did
,
that
they
would
not
be
pleased
,
would
it
become
her
to
throw
upon
her
lover
the
burthen
of
finding
for
her
a
home
with
people
who
did
not
want
her
?
<EOS>
Had
she
been
welcome
at
Bobsborough
<EOS>
,
Mrs.
Greystock
would
surely
have
so
told
her
before
this
.
<EOS>
"
You
need
n't
say
a
word
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Lady
Fawn
.
<EOS>
"
You
'll
come
,
and
there
's
an
end
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
do
n't
want
me
any
more
,
"
said
Lucy
,
from
amidst
her
sobs
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
just
all
that
you
know
about
it
,
"
said
Lydia
.
<EOS>
"
We
do
want
you
,
 
more
than
anything
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
whether
I
may
come
in
now
,
"
said
Lady
Linlithgow
,
entering
the
room
.
<EOS>
As
it
was
the
countess
's
own
drawing
-
room
,
as
it
was
now
mid
-
winter
,
and
as
the
fire
in
the
dining
-
room
had
been
allowed
,
as
was
usual
,
to
sink
almost
to
two
hot
coals
,
the
request
was
not
unreasonable
.
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
was
profuse
in
her
thanks
,
and
immediately
began
to
account
for
Lucy
's
tears
,
pleading
their
dear
friendship
and
their
long
absence
,
and
poor
Lucy
's
emotional
state
of
mind
.
<EOS>
Then
she
took
her
leave
,
and
Lucy
,
as
soon
as
she
had
been
kissed
by
her
friends
outside
the
drawing
-
room
door
,
took
herself
to
her
bedroom
,
and
finished
her
tears
in
the
cold
.
  
<EOS>
"
Have
you
heard
the
news
?
"
said
Lady
Linlithgow
to
her
companion
about
a
month
after
this
.
<EOS>
Lady
Linlithgow
had
been
out
,
and
asked
the
question
immediately
on
her
return
.
<EOS>
Lucy
,
of
course
,
had
heard
no
news
.
"
<EOS>
Lizzie
Eustace
has
just
come
back
to
London
,
and
has
had
all
her
jewels
stolen
on
the
road
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
diamonds
?
"
asked
Lucy
,
with
amaze
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
 
the
Eustace
diamonds
!
<EOS>
And
they
did
n't
belong
to
her
any
more
than
they
did
to
you
.
<EOS>
They
've
been
taken
,
anyway
;
and
from
what
I
hear
I
should
n't
be
at
all
surprised
if
she
had
arranged
the
whole
matter
herself
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
Arranged
that
they
should
be
stolen
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Just
that
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
the
very
thing
for
Lizzie
Eustace
to
do
.
<EOS>
She
's
clever
enough
for
anything
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
Lady
Linlithgow
 
"
  
"
I
know
all
about
that
.
<EOS>
Of
course
,
it
would
be
very
wicked
,
and
if
it
were
found
out
she
'd
be
put
in
the
dock
and
tried
for
her
life
.
<EOS>
It
is
just
what
I
expect
she
'll
come
to
some
of
these
days
.
<EOS>
She
has
gone
and
got
up
a
friendship
with
some
disreputable
people
,
and
was
travelling
with
them
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
man
who
calls
himself
Lord
George
de
Bruce
Carruthers
.
<EOS>
I
know
him
,
and
can
remember
when
he
was
errand
-
boy
to
a
disreputable
lawyer
at
Aberdeen
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
This
assertion
was
a
falsehood
on
the
part
of
the
countess
;
Lord
George
had
never
been
an
errand
-
boy
,
and
the
Aberdeen
lawyer
,
 
as
provincial
Scotch
lawyers
go
<EOS>
,
 
had
been
by
no
means
disreputable
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
told
that
the
police
think
that
he
has
got
them
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
very
dreadful
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
 
it
's
dreadful
enough
.
<EOS>
At
any
rate
,
men
got
into
Lizzie
's
room
at
night
and
took
away
the
iron
box
and
diamonds
and
all
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
she
was
asleep
at
the
time
;
 
<EOS>
but
she
's
one
of
those
who
pretty
nearly
always
sleep
with
one
eye
open
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
ca
n't
be
so
bad
as
that
,
Lady
Linlithgow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
not
.
<EOS>
We
shall
see
.
<EOS>
They
had
just
begun
a
lawsuit
about
the
diamonds
,
 
to
get
them
back
.
<EOS>
And
then
all
at
once
,
 
they
're
stolen
.
<EOS>
It
looks
what
the
men
call
 
fishy
.
<EOS>
I
'm
told
that
all
the
police
in
London
are
up
about
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
On
the
very
next
day
who
should
come
to
Brook
Street
,
but
Lizzie
Eustace
herself
.
<EOS>
She
and
her
aunt
had
quarrelled
,
and
they
hated
each
other
;
 
but
the
old
woman
had
called
upon
Lizzie
,
advising
her
,
as
the
reader
will
perhaps
remember
,
to
give
up
the
diamonds
,
and
now
Lizzie
returned
the
visit
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
So
you
're
here
,
installed
in
poor
Macnulty
's
place
,
"
began
Lizzie
to
her
old
friend
,
the
countess
at
the
moment
being
out
of
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
staying
with
your
aunt
for
a
few
months
,
 
as
her
companion
.
<EOS>
Is
it
true
,
Lizzie
,
that
all
your
diamonds
have
been
stolen
?
"
<EOS>
Lizzie
gave
an
account
of
the
robbery
,
true
in
every
respect
,
except
in
regard
to
the
contents
of
the
box
.
<EOS>
Poor
Lizzie
had
been
wronged
in
that
matter
by
the
countess
,
for
the
robbery
had
been
quite
genuine
.
<EOS>
The
man
had
opened
her
room
and
taken
her
box
,
and
she
had
slept
through
it
all
.
<EOS>
And
then
the
broken
box
had
been
found
,
and
was
in
the
hands
of
the
police
,
and
was
evidence
of
the
fact
.
  
<EOS>
"
People
seem
to
think
it
possible
,
"
said
Lizzie
,
"
that
Mr.
Camperdown
the
lawyer
arranged
it
all
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
this
suggestion
was
being
made
Lady
Linlithgow
came
in
,
and
then
Lizzie
repeated
the
whole
story
of
the
robbery
.
<EOS>
Though
the
aunt
and
niece
were
open
and
declared
enemies
,
the
present
circumstances
were
so
peculiar
and
full
of
interest
that
conversation
,
for
a
time
almost
amicable
,
took
place
between
them
.
"
<EOS>
As
the
diamonds
were
so
valuable
,
I
thought
it
right
,
Aunt
Susanna
,
to
come
and
tell
you
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
very
good
of
you
,
but
I
'd
heard
it
already
.
<EOS>
I
was
telling
Miss
Morris
yesterday
<EOS>
what
very
odd
things
there
are
being
said
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Were
n't
you
very
much
frightened
?
"
asked
Lucy
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
my
child
,
I
knew
nothing
about
it
till
it
was
all
over
.
<EOS>
The
man
cut
the
bit
out
of
the
door
in
the
most
beautiful
way
,
without
my
ever
hearing
the
least
sound
of
the
saw
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
you
that
sleep
so
light
,
"
said
the
countess
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
say
that
perhaps
something
was
put
into
the
wine
at
dinner
to
make
me
sleep
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Ah
!
"
ejaculated
the
countess
,
who
did
not
for
a
moment
give
up
her
own
erroneous
suspicion
;
 
"
very
likely
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
they
do
say
these
people
can
do
things
without
making
the
slightest
tittle
of
noise
.
<EOS>
At
any
rate
,
the
box
was
gone
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
the
diamonds
?
<EOS>
"
asked
Lucy
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
yes
;
 
of
course
.
<EOS>
And
now
there
is
such
a
fuss
about
it
!
<EOS>
The
police
keep
on
coming
to
me
almost
every
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
what
do
the
police
think
?
"
asked
Lady
Linlithgow
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
told
that
they
have
their
suspicions
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
doubt
they
have
their
suspicions
,
"
said
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
travelled
up
with
friends
,
I
suppose
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Oh
yes
,
 
with
Lord
George
de
Bruce
Carruthers
;
and
with
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
 
who
is
my
particular
friend
,
and
with
Lucinda
Roanoke
,
who
is
just
going
to
be
married
to
Sir
Griffin
Tewett
.
<EOS>
We
were
quite
a
large
party
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
Macnulty
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
No
.
<EOS>
I
left
Miss
Macnulty
at
Portray
with
my
darling
.
<EOS>
They
thought
he
had
better
remain
a
little
longer
in
Scotland
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
yes
;
 
perhaps
Lord
George
de
Bruce
Carruthers
does
not
care
for
babies
.
<EOS>
I
can
easily
believe
that
.
<EOS>
I
wish
Macnulty
had
been
with
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
do
you
wish
that
?
"
said
Lizzie
,
who
already
was
beginning
to
feel
that
the
countess
intended
,
as
usual
,
to
make
herself
disagreeable
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
's
a
stupid
,
dull
,
pig
-
headed
creature
;
but
one
can
believe
what
she
says
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
do
n't
you
believe
what
I
say
?
"
demanded
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
all
true
,
no
doubt
,
that
the
diamonds
are
gone
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
it
is
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
do
n't
know
much
about
Lord
George
de
Bruce
Carruthers
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
's
the
brother
of
a
marquis
,
anyway
,
"
said
Lizzie
,
who
thought
that
she
might
thus
best
answer
the
mother
of
a
Scotch
Earl
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
remember
when
he
was
plain
George
Carruthers
,
running
about
the
streets
of
Aberdeen
,
and
it
was
well
with
him
when
his
shoes
were
n't
broken
at
the
toes
and
down
at
heel
.
<EOS>
He
earned
his
bread
then
,
such
as
it
was
;
 
nobody
knows
how
he
gets
it
now
.
<EOS>
Why
does
he
call
himself
de
Bruce
,
I
wonder
?
"
  
"
Because
his
godfathers
and
godmothers
gave
him
that
name
when
he
was
made
a
child
of
Christ
,
and
an
inheritor
of
the
kingdom
of
heaven
,
"
said
Lizzie
,
ever
so
pertly
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
believe
a
bit
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
n't
there
to
see
,
Aunt
Susanna
;
and
therefore
I
ca
n't
swear
to
it
.
<EOS>
That
's
his
name
in
all
the
peerages
,
and
I
suppose
they
ought
to
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
does
Lord
George
de
Bruce
say
about
the
diamonds
?
"
  
<EOS>
Now
it
had
come
to
pass
that
Lady
Eustace
herself
did
not
feel
altogether
sure
that
Lord
George
had
not
had
a
hand
in
this
robbery
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
been
a
trick
worthy
of
a
genuine
Corsair
to
arrange
and
carry
out
such
a
scheme
for
the
appropriation
of
so
rich
a
spoil
.
<EOS>
A
watch
or
a
brooch
would
,
of
course
,
be
beneath
the
notice
of
a
good
genuine
Corsair
,
 
of
a
Corsair
who
was
written
down
in
the
peerage
as
a
marquis
's
brother
;
 
but
diamonds
worth
ten
thousand
pounds
are
not
to
be
had
every
day
.
<EOS>
A
Corsair
must
live
,
and
if
not
by
plunder
rich
as
that
,
 
how
then
?
<EOS>
If
Lord
George
had
concocted
this
little
scheme
,
he
would
naturally
be
ignorant
of
the
true
event
of
the
robbery
till
he
should
meet
the
humble
executors
of
his
design
,
and
would
,
as
Lizzie
thought
,
have
remained
unaware
of
the
truth
till
his
arrival
in
London
.
<EOS>
That
he
had
been
ignorant
of
the
truth
during
the
journey
was
evident
to
her
.
<EOS>
But
they
had
now
been
three
days
in
London
,
during
which
she
had
seen
him
once
.
<EOS>
At
that
interview
he
had
been
sullen
and
almost
cross
,
 
and
had
said
next
to
nothing
about
the
robbery
.
<EOS>
He
made
but
one
remark
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
told
the
chief
man
here
,
"
he
said
,
"
that
I
shall
be
ready
to
give
any
evidence
in
my
power
when
called
upon
.
<EOS>
Till
then
I
shall
take
no
further
steps
in
the
matter
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
asked
questions
that
should
not
have
been
asked
.
"
<EOS>
In
saying
this
he
had
used
a
tone
which
prevented
further
conversation
on
the
subject
,
but
Lizzie
,
as
she
thought
of
it
all
,
remembered
his
jocular
remark
,
made
in
the
railway
carriage
,
as
to
the
suspicion
which
had
already
been
expressed
on
the
matter
in
regard
to
himself
.
<EOS>
If
he
had
been
the
perpetrator
,
and
had
then
found
that
he
had
only
stolen
the
box
,
how
wonderful
would
be
the
mystery
!
"
<EOS>
He
has
n't
got
anything
to
say
,
"
replied
Lizzie
to
the
question
of
the
countess
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
who
is
your
Mrs.
Carbuncle
?
"
asked
the
old
woman
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
particular
friend
of
mine
with
whom
I
am
staying
at
present
.
<EOS>
You
do
n't
go
about
a
great
deal
,
Aunt
Linlithgow
,
but
surely
you
must
have
met
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
an
ignorant
old
woman
,
no
doubt
.
<EOS>
My
dear
,
I
'm
not
at
all
surprised
at
your
losing
your
diamonds
.
<EOS>
The
pity
is
that
they
were
n't
your
own
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
were
my
own
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
loss
will
fall
on
you
,
no
doubt
,
because
the
Eustace
people
will
make
you
pay
for
them
.
<EOS>
You
'll
have
to
give
up
half
your
jointure
for
your
life
.
<EOS>
That
's
what
it
will
come
to
.
<EOS>
To
think
of
your
travelling
about
with
those
things
in
a
box
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
were
my
own
,
and
I
had
a
right
to
do
what
I
liked
with
them
.
<EOS>
Nobody
accuses
you
of
taking
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
quite
true
.
<EOS>
Nobody
will
accuse
me
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
Lord
George
has
left
England
for
the
benefit
of
his
health
.
<EOS>
It
would
not
at
all
surprise
me
if
I
were
to
hear
that
Mrs.
Carbuncle
had
followed
him
;
 
not
in
the
least
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
're
just
like
yourself
,
Aunt
Susanna
,
"
said
Lizzie
,
getting
up
and
taking
her
leave
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Good
-
bye
,
Lucy
,
 
<EOS>
I
hope
you
're
happy
and
comfortable
here
.
<EOS>
Do
you
ever
see
a
certain
friend
of
ours
now
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
mean
Mr.
Greystock
,
I
have
n't
seen
him
since
I
left
Fawn
Court
,
"
said
Lucy
,
with
dignity
.
  
<EOS>
When
Lizzie
was
gone
,
Lady
Linlithgow
spoke
her
mind
freely
about
her
niece
.
"
<EOS>
Lizzie
Eustace
wo
n't
come
to
any
good
.
<EOS>
When
I
heard
that
she
was
engaged
to
that
prig
,
Lord
Fawn
,
I
had
some
hopes
that
she
might
be
kept
out
of
harm
.
<EOS>
That
's
all
over
,
of
course
.
<EOS>
When
he
heard
about
the
necklace
he
was
n't
going
to
put
his
neck
into
that
scrape
.
<EOS>
But
now
she
's
getting
among
such
a
set
that
nothing
can
save
her
.
<EOS>
She
has
taken
to
hunting
,
and
rides
about
the
country
like
a
madwoman
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
A
great
many
ladies
hunt
,
"
said
Lucy
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
she
's
got
hold
of
this
Lord
George
,
and
of
that
horrid
American
woman
that
nobody
knows
anything
about
.
<EOS>
They
've
got
the
diamonds
between
them
,
I
do
n't
doubt
.
<EOS>
I
'll
bet
you
sixpence
that
the
police
find
out
all
about
it
,
and
that
there
is
some
terrible
scandal
.
<EOS>
The
diamonds
were
no
more
hers
than
they
were
mine
,
and
she
'll
be
made
to
pay
for
them
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
necklace
,
the
meanwhile
,
was
still
locked
up
in
Lizzie
's
desk
,
 
with
a
patent
Bramah
key
,
 
in
Mrs.
Carbuncle
's
house
,
and
was
a
terrible
trouble
to
our
unhappy
friend
.
   
<EOS>
Matching
Priory
 
<EOS>
Before
the
end
of
January
everybody
in
London
had
heard
of
the
great
robbery
at
Carlisle
,
 
and
most
people
had
heard
also
that
there
was
something
very
peculiar
in
the
matter
,
 
something
more
than
a
robbery
.
<EOS>
Various
rumours
were
afloat
.
<EOS>
It
had
become
widely
known
that
the
diamonds
were
to
be
the
subject
of
litigation
between
the
young
widow
and
the
trustees
of
the
Eustace
estate
;
and
it
was
known
also
that
Lord
Fawn
had
engaged
himself
to
marry
the
widow
,
and
had
then
retreated
from
his
engagement
simply
on
account
of
this
litigation
.
<EOS>
There
were
strong
parties
formed
in
the
matter
,
 
whom
we
may
call
Lizzieites
and
anti
-
Lizzieites
.
<EOS>
The
Lizzieites
were
of
opinion
that
poor
Lady
Eustace
was
being
very
ill
-
treated
;
 
that
the
diamonds
did
probably
belong
to
her
,
and
that
Lord
Fawn
,
at
any
rate
,
clearly
ought
to
be
her
own
.
<EOS>
It
was
worthy
of
remark
that
these
Lizzieites
were
all
of
them
Conservatives
.
<EOS>
Frank
Greystock
had
probably
set
the
party
on
foot
;
 
and
it
was
natural
that
political
opponents
should
believe
that
a
noble
young
Under
-
Secretary
of
State
on
the
Liberal
side
,
 
such
as
Lord
Fawn
,
 
had
misbehaved
himself
.
<EOS>
When
the
matter
at
last
became
of
such
importance
as
to
demand
leading
articles
in
the
newspapers
,
those
journals
which
had
devoted
themselves
to
upholding
the
Conservative
politicians
of
the
day
were
very
heavy
indeed
upon
Lord
Fawn
.
<EOS>
The
whole
force
of
the
Government
,
however
,
was
anti
-
Lizzieite
;
and
as
the
controversy
advanced
,
every
good
Liberal
became
aware
that
there
was
nothing
so
wicked
,
so
rapacious
,
so
bold
,
or
so
cunning
but
that
Lady
Eustace
might
have
done
it
,
or
caused
it
to
be
done
,
without
delay
,
without
difficulty
,
and
without
scruple
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
Palliser
for
a
while
endeavoured
to
defend
Lizzie
in
Liberal
circles
,
 
from
generosity
rather
than
from
any
real
belief
,
and
instigated
,
perhaps
,
by
a
feeling
that
any
woman
in
society
who
was
capable
of
doing
anything
extraordinary
ought
to
be
defended
.
<EOS>
But
even
Lady
Glencora
was
forced
to
abandon
her
generosity
,
and
to
confess
,
on
behalf
of
her
party
,
that
Lizzie
Eustace
was
 
a
very
wicked
young
woman
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
All
this
,
no
doubt
,
grew
out
of
the
diamonds
,
and
chiefly
arose
from
the
robbery
;
but
there
had
been
enough
of
notoriety
attached
to
Lizzie
before
the
affair
at
Carlisle
to
make
people
fancy
that
they
had
understood
her
character
long
before
that
.
  
<EOS>
The
party
assembled
at
Matching
Priory
,
a
country
house
belonging
to
Mr.
Palliser
,
in
which
Lady
Glencora
took
much
delight
,
was
not
large
,
because
Mr.
Palliser
's
uncle
,
the
Duke
of
Omnium
,
who
was
with
them
,
was
now
a
very
old
man
,
and
one
who
did
not
like
very
large
gatherings
of
people
.
<EOS>
Lord
and
Lady
Chiltern
were
there
,
 
that
Lord
Chiltern
who
had
been
known
so
long
and
so
well
in
the
hunting
counties
of
England
,
and
that
Lady
Chiltern
who
had
been
so
popular
in
London
as
the
beautiful
Violet
Effingham
;
and
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Grey
were
there
,
very
particular
friends
of
Mr.
Palliser
's
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Grey
was
now
sitting
for
the
borough
of
Silverbridge
,
in
which
the
Duke
of
Omnium
was
still
presumed
to
have
a
controlling
influence
,
in
spite
of
all
Reform
bills
,
and
Mrs.
Grey
was
in
some
distant
way
connected
with
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
And
Madame
Max
Goesler
was
there
,
 
a
lady
whose
society
was
still
much
affected
by
the
old
duke
;
and
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Bonteen
,
 
who
had
been
brought
there
,
not
,
perhaps
altogether
because
they
were
greatly
loved
,
but
in
order
that
the
gentleman
's
services
might
be
made
available
by
Mr.
Palliser
in
reference
to
some
great
reform
about
to
be
introduced
in
monetary
matters
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
,
who
was
now
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
,
was
intending
to
alter
the
value
of
the
penny
.
<EOS>
Unless
the
work
should
be
too
much
for
him
,
and
he
should
die
before
he
had
accomplished
the
self
-
imposed
task
,
the
future
penny
was
to
be
made
,
under
his
auspices
,
to
contain
five
farthings
,
and
the
shilling
ten
pennies
.
<EOS>
It
was
thought
that
if
this
could
be
accomplished
,
the
arithmetic
of
the
whole
world
would
be
so
simplified
that
henceforward
<EOS>
the
name
of
Palliser
would
be
blessed
by
all
schoolboys
,
clerks
,
shopkeepers
,
and
financiers
.
<EOS>
But
the
difficulties
were
so
great
that
Mr.
Palliser
's
hair
was
already
grey
from
toil
,
and
his
shoulders
bent
by
the
burthen
imposed
upon
them
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bonteen
,
with
two
private
secretaries
from
the
Treasury
,
was
now
at
Matching
to
assist
Mr.
Palliser
;
 
and
it
was
thought
that
both
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Bonteen
were
near
to
madness
under
the
pressure
of
the
five
-
farthing
penny
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bonteen
had
remarked
to
many
of
his
political
friends
that
those
two
extra
farthings
that
could
not
be
made
to
go
into
the
shilling
would
put
him
into
his
cold
grave
before
the
world
would
know
what
he
had
done
,
 
or
had
rewarded
him
for
it
with
a
handle
to
his
name
,
and
a
pension
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
was
also
at
Matching
,
 
a
suggestion
having
been
made
to
Lady
Glencora
by
some
leading
Liberals
that
he
should
be
supported
in
his
difficulties
by
her
hospitality
.
  
<EOS>
The
mind
of
Mr.
Palliser
himself
was
too
deeply
engaged
to
admit
of
its
being
interested
in
the
great
necklace
affair
;
but
,
of
all
the
others
assembled
,
there
was
not
one
who
did
not
listen
anxiously
for
news
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
As
regarded
the
old
duke
,
it
had
been
found
to
be
quite
a
godsend
;
and
from
post
to
post
as
the
facts
reached
Matching
they
were
communicated
to
him
.
<EOS>
And
,
indeed
,
there
were
some
there
who
would
not
wait
for
the
post
,
but
had
the
news
about
poor
Lizzie
's
diamonds
down
by
the
wires
.
<EOS>
The
matter
was
of
the
greatest
moment
to
Lord
Fawn
,
and
Lady
Glencora
was
,
perhaps
,
justified
,
on
his
behalf
,
in
demanding
a
preference
for
her
affairs
over
the
messages
which
were
continually
passing
between
Matching
and
the
Treasury
respecting
those
two
ill
-
conditioned
farthings
.
  
<EOS>
"
Duke
,
"
she
said
,
entering
rather
abruptly
the
small
,
warm
,
luxurious
room
in
which
her
husband
's
uncle
was
passing
his
morning
,
"
duke
,
they
say
now
that
after
all
the
diamonds
were
not
in
the
box
when
it
was
taken
out
of
the
room
at
Carlisle
.
<EOS>
"
The
duke
was
reclining
in
an
easy
-
chair
,
with
his
head
leaning
forward
on
his
breast
,
and
Madame
Goesler
was
reading
to
him
.
<EOS>
It
was
now
three
o'clock
,
and
the
old
man
had
been
brought
down
to
this
room
after
his
breakfast
.
<EOS>
Madame
Goesler
was
reading
the
last
famous
new
novel
,
and
the
duke
was
dozing
.
<EOS>
That
,
probably
,
was
the
fault
neither
of
the
reader
nor
of
the
novelist
,
as
the
duke
was
wo
nt
to
doze
in
these
days
.
<EOS>
But
Lady
Glencora
's
tidings
awakened
him
completely
.
<EOS>
She
had
the
telegram
in
her
hand
,
 
so
that
he
could
perceive
that
the
very
latest
news
was
brought
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
diamonds
not
in
the
box
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
 
pushing
his
head
a
little
more
forward
in
his
eagerness
,
and
sitting
with
the
extended
fingers
of
his
two
hands
touching
each
other
.
  
<EOS>
"
Barrington
Erle
says
that
Major
Mackintosh
is
almost
sure
the
diamonds
were
not
there
.
"
<EOS>
Major
Mackintosh
was
an
officer
very
high
in
the
police
force
,
whom
everybody
trusted
implicitly
,
and
as
to
whom
the
outward
world
believed
that
he
could
discover
the
perpetrators
of
any
iniquity
,
if
he
would
only
take
the
trouble
to
look
into
it
.
<EOS>
Such
was
the
pressing
nature
of
his
duties
that
he
found
himself
compelled
in
one
way
or
another
to
give
up
about
sixteen
hours
a
day
to
them
;
 
but
the
outer
world
accused
him
of
idleness
.
<EOS>
There
was
nothing
he
could
n't
find
out
;
 
only
he
would
not
give
himself
the
trouble
to
find
out
all
the
things
that
happened
.
<EOS>
Two
or
three
newspapers
had
already
been
very
hard
upon
him
in
regard
to
the
Eustace
diamonds
.
<EOS>
Such
a
mystery
as
that
<EOS>
,
they
said
,
he
ought
to
have
unravelled
long
ago
.
<EOS>
That
he
had
not
unravelled
it
yet
was
quite
certain
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
diamonds
not
in
the
box
!
"
said
the
duke
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
she
must
have
known
it
,
"
said
Madame
Goesler
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
does
n't
quite
follow
,
Madame
Max
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
why
should
n't
the
diamonds
have
been
in
the
box
?
"
asked
the
duke
.
<EOS>
As
this
was
the
first
intimation
given
to
Lady
Glencora
of
any
suspicion
that
the
diamonds
had
not
been
taken
with
the
box
,
and
as
this
had
been
received
by
telegraph
,
she
could
not
answer
the
duke
's
question
with
any
clear
exposition
of
her
own
.
<EOS>
She
put
up
her
hands
and
shook
her
head
.
<EOS>
"
What
does
Plantagenet
think
about
it
?
"
asked
the
duke
.
<EOS>
Plantagenet
Palliser
was
the
full
name
of
the
duke
's
nephew
and
heir
.
<EOS>
The
duke
's
mind
was
evidently
much
disturbed
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
does
n't
think
that
either
the
box
or
the
diamonds
were
ever
worth
five
farthings
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
diamonds
not
in
the
box
!
"
repeated
the
duke
.
"
<EOS>
Madame
Max
,
do
you
believe
that
the
diamonds
were
not
in
the
box
?
"
<EOS>
Madame
Goesler
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
made
no
answer
;
but
the
shrugging
of
her
shoulders
was
quite
satisfactory
to
the
duke
,
who
always
thought
that
Madame
Goesler
did
everything
better
than
anybody
else
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
stayed
with
her
uncle
for
the
best
part
of
an
hour
,
and
every
word
spoken
was
devoted
to
Lizzie
and
her
necklace
;
but
as
this
new
idea
had
been
broached
,
and
as
they
had
no
other
information
than
that
conveyed
in
the
telegram
,
very
little
light
could
be
thrown
upon
it
.
<EOS>
But
on
the
next
morning
there
came
a
letter
from
Barrington
Erle
to
Lady
Glencora
,
which
told
so
much
,
and
hinted
so
much
more
,
that
it
will
be
well
to
give
it
to
the
reader
.

MY
DEAR
LADY
GLENCORA
,
  
<EOS>
I
hope
you
got
my
telegram
yesterday
.
<EOS>
I
had
just
seen
Mackintosh
,
 
on
whose
behalf
,
however
,
I
must
say
that
he
told
me
as
little
as
he
possibly
could
.
<EOS>
It
is
leaking
out
,
however
,
on
every
side
,
that
the
police
believe
that
when
the
box
was
taken
out
of
the
room
at
Carlisle
,
the
diamonds
were
not
in
it
.
<EOS>
As
far
as
I
can
learn
,
they
ground
this
suspicion
on
the
fact
that
they
can
not
trace
the
stones
.
<EOS>
They
say
that
,
if
such
a
lot
of
diamonds
had
been
through
the
thieves
"
market
in
London
,
they
would
have
left
some
track
behind
them
.
<EOS>
As
far
as
I
can
judge
,
Mackintosh
thinks
that
Lord
George
has
them
,
but
that
her
ladyship
gave
them
to
him
;
and
that
this
little
game
of
the
robbery
at
Carlisle
was
planned
to
put
John
Eustace
and
the
lawyers
off
the
scent
.
<EOS>
If
it
should
turn
out
that
the
box
was
opened
before
it
left
Portray
,
that
the
door
of
her
ladyship
's
room
was
cut
by
her
ladyship
's
self
,
or
by
his
lordship
with
her
ladyship
's
aid
,
and
that
the
fragments
of
the
box
were
carried
out
of
the
hotel
by
his
lordship
in
person
,
it
will
altogether
have
been
so
delightful
a
plot
,
that
all
concerned
in
it
ought
to
be
canonised
,
 
or
at
least
allowed
to
keep
their
plunder
.
<EOS>
One
of
the
old
detectives
told
me
that
the
opening
of
the
box
under
the
arch
of
the
railway
,
in
an
exposed
place
,
could
hardly
have
been
executed
so
neatly
as
was
done
;
 
that
no
thief
so
situated
would
have
given
the
time
necessary
to
it
;
and
that
,
if
there
had
been
thieves
at
all
at
work
,
they
would
have
been
traced
.
<EOS>
Against
this
,
there
is
the
certain
fact
,
 
as
I
have
heard
from
various
men
engaged
in
the
inquiry
,
 
that
certain
persons
among
the
community
of
thieves
are
very
much
at
loggerheads
with
each
other
,
 
the
higher
,
or
creative
department
in
thiefdom
,
accusing
the
lower
or
mechanical
department
of
gross
treachery
in
having
appropriated
to
its
own
sole
profit
plunder
,
for
the
taking
of
which
it
had
undertaken
to
receive
a
certain
stipulated
price
.
<EOS>
But
then
it
may
be
the
case
that
his
lordship
and
her
ladyship
have
set
such
a
rumour
abroad
for
the
sake
of
putting
the
police
off
the
scent
.
<EOS>
Upon
the
whole
,
the
little
mystery
is
quite
delightful
;
and
has
put
the
ballot
,
and
poor
Mr.
Palliser
's
five
-
farthinged
penny
,
quite
out
of
joint
.
<EOS>
Nobody
now
cares
for
anything
except
the
Eustace
diamonds
.
<EOS>
Lord
George
,
I
am
told
,
has
offered
to
fight
everybody
or
anybody
,
beginning
with
Lord
Fawn
and
ending
with
Major
Mackintosh
.
<EOS>
Should
he
be
innocent
,
which
,
of
course
,
is
possible
,
the
thing
must
be
annoying
.
<EOS>
I
should
not
at
all
wonder
myself
,
if
it
should
turn
out
that
her
ladyship
left
them
in
Scotland
.
<EOS>
The
place
there
,
however
,
has
been
searched
,
in
compliance
with
an
order
from
the
police
and
by
her
ladyship
's
consent
.
  
<EOS>
Do
n't
let
Mr.
Palliser
quite
kill
himself
.
<EOS>
I
hope
the
Bonteen
plan
answers
.
<EOS>
I
never
knew
a
man
who
could
find
more
farthings
in
a
shilling
than
Mr.
Bonteen
.
<EOS>
Remember
me
very
kindly
to
the
duke
,
and
pray
enable
poor
Fawn
to
keep
up
his
spirits
.
<EOS>
If
he
likes
to
arrange
a
meeting
with
Lord
George
,
I
shall
be
only
too
happy
to
be
his
friend
.
<EOS>
You
remember
our
last
duel
.
<EOS>
Chiltern
is
with
you
,
and
can
put
Fawn
up
to
the
proper
way
of
getting
over
to
Flanders
,
 
and
of
returning
,
should
he
chance
to
escape
.
  
<EOS>
Yours
always
most
faithfully
,
  
BARRINGTON
ERLE
.
  
<EOS>
Of
course
,
I
'll
keep
you
posted
in
everything
respecting
the
necklace
till
you
come
to
town
yourself
.
  
<EOS>
The
whole
of
this
letter
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
read
to
the
duke
,
to
Lady
Chiltern
,
and
to
Madame
Goesler
;
 
and
the
principal
contents
of
it
she
repeated
to
the
entire
company
.
<EOS>
It
was
certainly
the
general
belief
at
Matching
that
Lord
George
had
the
diamonds
in
his
possession
,
 
either
with
or
without
the
assistance
of
their
late
fair
possessor
.
  
<EOS>
The
duke
was
struck
with
awe
when
he
thought
of
all
the
circumstances
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
brother
of
a
marquis
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
to
his
nephew
's
wife
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
such
a
disgrace
to
the
peerage
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
As
for
that
,
duke
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
,
"
the
peerage
is
used
to
it
by
this
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
heard
of
such
an
affair
as
this
before
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
see
why
the
brother
of
a
marquis
should
n't
turn
thief
as
well
as
anybody
else
.
<EOS>
They
say
he
has
n't
got
anything
of
his
own
;
 
and
I
suppose
that
is
what
makes
men
steal
other
people
's
property
.
<EOS>
Peers
go
into
trade
,
and
peeresses
gamble
on
the
Stock
Exchange
.
<EOS>
Peers
become
bankrupt
,
and
the
sons
of
peers
run
away
;
 
just
like
other
men
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
see
why
all
enterprises
should
not
be
open
to
them
.
<EOS>
But
to
think
of
that
little
purring
cat
,
Lady
Eustace
,
having
been
so
very
 
very
clever
!
<EOS>
It
makes
me
quite
envious
.
"
  
<EOS>
All
this
took
place
in
the
morning
;
 
that
is
,
about
two
o'clock
;
but
after
dinner
the
subject
became
general
.
<EOS>
There
might
be
some
little
reticence
in
regard
to
Lord
Fawn
's
feelings
,
 
but
it
was
not
sufficient
to
banish
a
subject
so
interesting
from
the
minds
and
lips
of
the
company
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
Tewett
marriage
is
to
come
off
,
after
all
,
"
said
Mrs.
Bonteen
.
<EOS>
"
I
've
a
letter
from
dear
Mrs.
Rutter
,
telling
me
so
as
a
fact
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
whether
Miss
Roanoke
will
be
allowed
to
wear
one
or
two
of
the
diamonds
at
the
wedding
,
"
suggested
one
of
the
private
secretaries
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nobody
will
dare
to
wear
a
diamond
at
all
next
season
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
for
my
own
,
I
sha'n't
think
of
having
them
out
.
<EOS>
I
should
always
feel
that
I
was
being
inspected
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Unless
they
unravel
the
mystery
,
"
said
Madame
Goesler
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
they
wo
n't
do
that
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
"
The
play
is
too
good
to
come
to
an
end
so
soon
.
<EOS>
If
we
hear
that
Lord
George
is
engaged
to
Lady
Eustace
,
nothing
,
I
suppose
,
can
be
done
to
stop
the
marriage
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
should
n't
she
marry
if
she
pleases
?
"
asked
Mr.
Palliser
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
've
not
the
slightest
objection
to
her
being
married
.
<EOS>
I
hope
she
will
,
with
all
my
heart
.
<EOS>
I
certainly
think
she
should
have
her
husband
after
buying
him
at
such
a
price
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
Lord
Fawn
wo
n't
forbid
the
banns
.
<EOS>
"
These
last
words
were
only
whispered
to
her
next
neighbour
,
Lord
Chiltern
;
but
poor
Lord
Fawn
saw
the
whisper
,
and
was
aware
that
it
must
have
had
reference
to
his
condition
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
next
morning
there
came
further
news
.
<EOS>
The
police
had
asked
permission
from
their
occupants
to
search
the
rooms
in
which
lived
Lady
Eustace
and
Lord
George
,
and
in
each
case
the
permission
had
been
refused
.
<EOS>
So
said
Barrington
Erle
in
his
letter
to
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
Lord
George
had
told
the
applicant
,
very
roughly
,
that
nobody
should
touch
any
article
belonging
to
him
without
a
search
-
warrant
.
<EOS>
If
any
magistrate
would
dare
to
give
such
a
warrant
,
let
him
do
it
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
told
that
Lord
George
acts
the
indignant
madman
uncommonly
well
,
"
said
Barrington
Erle
in
his
letter
.
<EOS>
As
for
poor
Lizzie
,
she
had
fainted
when
the
proposition
was
made
to
her
.
<EOS>
The
request
was
renewed
as
soon
as
she
had
been
brought
to
herself
;
and
then
she
refused
,
 
on
the
advice
,
as
she
said
,
of
her
cousin
,
Mr.
Greystock
.
<EOS>
Barrington
Erle
went
on
to
say
that
the
police
were
very
much
blamed
.
<EOS>
It
was
believed
that
no
information
could
be
laid
before
a
magistrate
sufficient
to
justify
a
search
-
warrant
;
 
and
,
in
such
circumstances
,
no
search
should
have
been
attempted
.
<EOS>
Such
was
the
public
verdict
,
as
declared
in
Barrington
Erle
's
last
letter
to
Lady
Glencora
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
was
of
opinion
that
the
attempt
to
search
the
lady
's
house
was
iniquitous
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bonteen
shook
his
head
,
and
rather
thought
that
,
if
he
were
Home
Secretary
,
he
would
have
had
the
search
made
.
<EOS>
Lady
Chiltern
said
that
if
policemen
came
to
her
,
they
might
search
everything
she
had
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Grey
reminded
them
that
all
they
really
knew
of
the
unfortunate
woman
was
,
that
her
jewel
-
box
had
been
stolen
out
of
her
bedroom
at
her
hotel
.
<EOS>
Madame
Goesler
was
of
opinion
that
a
lady
who
could
carry
such
a
box
about
the
country
with
her
deserved
to
have
it
stolen
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
felt
himself
obliged
to
confess
that
he
agreed
altogether
with
Madame
Goesler
.
<EOS>
Unfortunately
,
he
had
been
acquainted
with
the
lady
,
and
now
was
constrained
to
say
that
her
conduct
had
been
such
as
to
justify
the
suspicions
of
the
police
.
<EOS>
"
Of
course
,
we
all
suspect
her
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
;
"
and
,
of
course
,
we
suspect
Lord
George
too
,
and
Mrs.
Carbuncle
and
Miss
Roanoke
.
<EOS>
But
then
,
you
know
,
if
I
were
to
lose
my
diamonds
,
people
would
suspect
me
just
the
same
,
 
or
perhaps
Plantagenet
.
<EOS>
It
is
so
delightful
to
think
that
a
woman
has
stolen
her
own
property
,
and
put
all
the
police
into
a
state
of
ferment
.
"
<EOS>
Lord
Chiltern
declared
himself
to
be
heartily
sick
of
the
whole
subject
;
and
Mr.
Grey
,
who
was
a
very
just
man
,
suggested
that
the
evidence
,
as
yet
,
against
anybody
,
was
very
slight
.
<EOS>
"
Of
course
,
it
's
slight
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
"
If
it
were
more
than
slight
,
it
would
be
just
like
any
other
robbery
,
and
there
would
be
nothing
in
it
.
"
<EOS>
On
the
same
morning
Mrs.
Bonteen
received
a
second
letter
from
her
friend
Mrs.
Rutter
.
<EOS>
The
Tewett
marriage
had
been
certainly
broken
off
.
<EOS>
Sir
Griffin
had
been
very
violent
,
misbehaving
himself
grossly
in
Mrs.
Carbuncle
's
house
,
and
Miss
Roanoke
had
declared
that
under
no
circumstances
would
she
ever
speak
to
him
again
.
<EOS>
It
was
Mrs.
Rutter
's
opinion
,
however
,
that
this
violence
had
been
"
put
on
"
by
Sir
Griffin
,
who
was
desirous
of
escaping
from
the
marriage
because
of
the
affair
of
the
diamonds
.
<EOS>
"
He
's
very
much
bound
up
with
Lord
George
,
"
said
Mrs.
Rutter
,
"
and
is
afraid
that
he
may
be
implicated
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
In
my
opinion
he
's
quite
right
,
"
said
Lord
Fawn
.
  
<EOS>
All
these
matters
were
told
to
the
duke
by
Lady
Glencora
and
Madame
Goesler
in
the
recesses
of
his
grace
's
private
room
;
for
the
duke
was
now
infirm
,
and
did
not
dine
in
company
unless
the
day
was
very
auspicious
to
him
.
<EOS>
But
in
the
evening
he
would
creep
into
the
drawing
-
room
,
and
on
this
occasion
he
had
a
word
to
say
about
the
Eustace
diamonds
to
every
one
in
the
room
.
<EOS>
It
was
admitted
by
them
all
that
the
robbery
had
been
a
godsend
in
the
way
of
amusing
the
duke
.
"
<EOS>
Would
n't
have
her
boxes
searched
,
you
know
,
"
said
the
duke
;
"
that
looks
uncommonly
suspicious
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
,
Lady
Chiltern
,
we
shall
hear
to
-
morrow
morning
something
more
about
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Poor
dear
duke
,
"
said
Lady
Chiltern
to
her
husband
.
  
<EOS>
"
Doting
old
idiot
!
"
<EOS>
he
replied
.
   
<EOS>
Lizzie
's
Condition
 
<EOS>
When
such
a
man
as
Barrington
Erle
undertakes
to
send
information
to
such
a
correspondent
as
Lady
Glencora
in
reference
to
such
a
matter
as
Lady
Eustace
's
diamonds
,
he
is
bound
to
be
full
rather
than
accurate
.
<EOS>
We
may
say
,
indeed
,
that
perfect
accuracy
would
be
detrimental
rather
than
otherwise
,
and
would
tend
to
disperse
that
feeling
of
mystery
which
is
so
gratifying
.
<EOS>
No
suggestion
had
in
truth
been
made
to
Lord
George
de
Bruce
Carruthers
as
to
the
searching
of
his
lordship
's
boxes
and
desks
.
<EOS>
That
very
eminent
detective
officer
,
Mr.
Bunfit
,
had
,
however
,
called
upon
Lord
George
more
than
once
,
and
Lord
George
had
declared
very
plainly
that
he
did
not
like
it
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
'll
have
the
kindness
to
explain
to
me
<EOS>
what
it
is
you
want
,
I
'll
be
much
obliged
to
you
,
"
Lord
George
had
said
to
Mr.
Bunfit
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
my
lord
,
"
said
Bunfit
,
"
what
we
want
is
these
diamonds
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
you
believe
that
I
've
got
them
?
"
  
"
A
man
in
my
situation
,
my
lord
,
never
believes
anything
.
<EOS>
We
has
to
suspect
,
but
we
never
believes
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
suspect
that
I
stole
them
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
my
lord
;
 
I
did
n't
say
that
.
<EOS>
But
things
are
very
queer
;
are
n't
they
?
"
<EOS>
The
immediate
object
of
Mr.
Bunfit
's
visit
on
this
morning
had
been
to
ascertain
from
Lord
George
whether
it
was
true
that
his
lordship
had
been
with
Messrs.
Harter
and
Benjamin
,
the
jewellers
,
on
the
morning
after
his
arrival
in
town
.
<EOS>
No
one
from
the
police
had
as
yet
seen
either
Harter
or
Benjamin
in
connexion
with
this
robbery
;
but
it
may
not
be
too
much
to
say
that
the
argus
eyes
of
Major
Mackintosh
were
upon
Messrs.
Harter
and
Benjamin
's
whole
establishment
,
and
it
was
believed
that
,
if
the
jewels
were
in
London
,
they
were
locked
up
in
some
box
within
that
house
.
<EOS>
It
was
thought
more
than
probable
by
Major
Mackintosh
and
his
myrmidons
that
the
jewels
were
already
at
Hamburg
;
and
by
this
time
,
as
the
major
had
explained
to
Mr.
Camperdown
,
every
one
of
them
might
have
been
reset
,
 
or
even
recut
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
known
that
Lord
George
had
been
at
the
house
of
Messrs.
Harter
and
Benjamin
early
on
the
morning
after
his
return
to
town
,
and
the
ingenuous
Mr.
Bunfit
,
who
,
by
reason
of
his
situation
,
never
believed
anything
and
only
suspected
,
had
expressed
a
very
strong
opinion
to
Major
Mackintosh
that
the
necklace
had
in
truth
been
transferred
to
the
Jews
on
that
morning
.
<EOS>
That
there
was
nothing
"
too
hot
or
too
heavy
"
for
Messrs.
Harter
and
Benjamin
was
quite
a
creed
with
the
police
of
the
west
end
of
London
.
<EOS>
Might
it
not
be
well
to
ask
Lord
George
what
he
had
to
say
about
the
visit
?
<EOS>
Should
Lord
George
deny
the
visit
,
such
denial
would
go
far
to
confirm
Mr.
Bunfit
.
<EOS>
The
question
was
asked
,
and
Lord
George
did
not
deny
the
visit
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Unfortunately
,
they
hold
acceptances
of
mine
,
"
said
Lord
George
,
"
and
I
am
often
there
.
"
<EOS>
"
We
know
as
they
have
your
lordship
's
name
to
paper
,
"
said
Mr.
Bunfit
,
 
thanking
Lord
George
,
however
,
for
his
courtesy
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
understood
that
all
this
would
be
unpleasant
to
Lord
George
,
and
that
he
should
be
indignant
almost
to
madness
.
  
<EOS>
But
Mr.
Erle
's
information
,
though
certainly
defective
in
regard
to
Lord
George
de
Bruce
Carruthers
,
had
been
more
correct
when
he
spoke
of
the
lady
.
<EOS>
An
interview
that
was
very
terrible
to
poor
Lizzie
did
take
place
between
her
and
Mr.
Bunfit
in
Mrs.
Carbuncle
's
house
on
Tuesday
,
the
30th
of
January
.
<EOS>
There
had
been
many
interviews
between
Lizzie
and
various
members
of
the
police
force
in
reference
to
the
diamonds
,
but
the
questions
put
to
her
had
always
been
asked
on
the
supposition
that
she
might
have
mislaid
the
necklace
.
<EOS>
Was
it
not
possible
that
she
might
have
thought
that
she
locked
it
up
,
but
have
omitted
to
place
it
in
the
box
?
<EOS>
As
long
as
these
questions
had
reference
to
a
possible
oversight
in
Scotland
,
 
to
some
carelessness
which
she
might
have
committed
on
the
night
before
she
left
her
home
,
 
Lizzie
upon
the
whole
seemed
rather
to
like
the
idea
.
<EOS>
It
certainly
was
possible
.
<EOS>
She
believed
thoroughly
that
the
diamonds
had
been
locked
by
her
in
the
box
,
 
but
she
acknowledged
that
it
might
be
the
case
that
they
had
been
left
on
one
side
.
<EOS>
This
had
happened
when
the
police
first
began
to
suspect
that
the
necklace
had
not
been
in
the
box
when
it
was
carried
out
of
the
Carlisle
hotel
,
but
before
it
had
occurred
to
them
that
Lord
George
had
been
concerned
in
the
robbery
,
and
possibly
Lady
Eustace
herself
.
<EOS>
Men
had
been
sent
down
from
London
,
of
course
at
considerable
expense
,
and
Portray
Castle
had
been
searched
,
with
the
consent
of
its
owner
,
from
the
weathercock
to
the
foundation
-
stone
,
 
much
to
the
consternation
of
Miss
Macnulty
,
and
to
the
delight
of
Andy
Gowran
.
<EOS>
No
trace
of
the
diamonds
was
found
,
and
Lizzie
had
so
far
fraternised
with
the
police
.
<EOS>
But
when
Mr.
Bunfit
called
upon
her
,
perhaps
for
the
fifth
or
sixth
time
,
and
suggested
that
he
should
be
allowed
,
with
the
assistance
of
the
female
whom
he
had
left
behind
him
in
the
hall
,
to
search
all
her
ladyship
's
boxes
,
drawers
,
presses
,
and
receptacles
in
London
,
the
thing
took
a
very
different
aspect
.
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
my
lady
,
"
said
Mr.
Bunfit
,
excusing
the
peculiar
nature
of
his
request
,
"
it
may
have
got
anywhere
among
your
ladyship
's
things
,
unbeknownst
.
"
<EOS>
Lady
Eustace
and
Mrs.
Carbuncle
were
at
the
time
sitting
together
,
and
Mrs.
Carbuncle
was
the
first
to
protest
.
<EOS>
If
Mr.
Bunfit
thought
that
he
was
going
to
search
her
things
,
Mr.
Bunfit
was
very
much
mistaken
.
<EOS>
What
she
had
suffered
about
this
necklace
<EOS>
no
man
or
woman
knew
,
 
and
she
meant
that
there
should
be
an
end
of
it
.
<EOS>
It
was
her
opinion
that
the
police
should
have
discovered
every
stone
of
it
days
and
days
ago
.
<EOS>
At
any
rate
,
her
house
was
her
own
,
and
she
gave
Mr.
Bunfit
to
understand
that
his
repeated
visits
were
not
agreeable
to
her
.
<EOS>
But
when
Mr.
Bunfit
,
without
showing
the
slightest
displeasure
at
the
evil
things
said
of
him
,
suggested
that
the
search
should
be
confined
to
the
rooms
used
exclusively
by
Lady
Eustace
,
Mrs.
Carbuncle
absolutely
changed
her
views
,
and
recommended
that
he
should
be
allowed
to
have
his
way
.
  
<EOS>
At
that
moment
the
condition
of
poor
Lizzie
Eustace
was
very
sad
.
<EOS>
He
who
recounts
these
details
has
scorned
to
have
a
secret
between
himself
and
his
readers
.
<EOS>
The
diamonds
were
at
this
moment
locked
up
within
Lizzie
's
desk
.
<EOS>
For
the
last
three
weeks
they
had
been
there
,
 
if
it
may
not
be
more
truly
said
that
they
were
lying
heavily
on
her
heart
.
<EOS>
For
three
weeks
had
her
mind
with
constant
stretch
been
working
on
that
point
,
 
whither
<EOS>
should
she
take
the
diamonds
,
and
what
should
she
do
with
them
?
<EOS>
A
certain
very
wonderful
strength
she
did
possess
,
or
she
could
not
have
endured
the
weight
of
so
terrible
an
anxiety
;
but
from
day
to
day
the
thing
became
worse
and
worse
with
her
<EOS>
,
as
gradually
she
perceived
that
suspicion
was
attached
to
herself
.
<EOS>
Should
she
confide
the
secret
to
Lord
George
,
or
to
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
or
to
Frank
Greystock
?
<EOS>
She
thought
she
could
have
borne
it
all
if
only
some
one
would
have
borne
it
with
her
.
<EOS>
But
when
the
moments
came
in
which
such
confidence
might
be
made
,
her
courage
failed
her
.
<EOS>
Lord
George
she
saw
frequently
;
but
he
was
unsympathetic
and
almost
rough
with
her
.
<EOS>
She
knew
that
he
also
was
suspected
,
and
she
was
almost
disposed
to
think
that
he
had
planned
the
robbery
.
<EOS>
If
it
were
so
,
if
the
robbery
had
been
his
handiwork
,
it
was
not
singular
that
he
should
be
unsympathetic
with
the
owner
and
probable
holder
of
the
prey
which
he
had
missed
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
Lizzie
thought
that
if
he
would
have
been
soft
with
her
,
like
a
dear
,
good
,
genuine
Corsair
,
for
half
an
hour
,
she
would
have
told
him
all
,
and
placed
the
necklace
in
his
hands
.
<EOS>
And
there
were
moments
in
which
she
almost
resolved
to
tell
her
secret
to
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
<EOS>
She
had
stolen
nothing
;
 
<EOS>
so
she
averred
to
herself
.
<EOS>
She
had
intended
only
to
defend
and
save
her
own
property
.
<EOS>
Even
the
lie
that
she
had
told
,
and
the
telling
of
which
was
continued
from
day
to
day
,
had
in
a
measure
been
forced
upon
her
by
circumstances
.
<EOS>
She
thought
that
Mrs.
Carbuncle
would
sympathise
with
her
in
that
feeling
which
had
prevented
her
from
speaking
the
truth
when
first
the
fact
of
the
robbery
was
made
known
to
herself
in
her
own
bedroom
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
was
a
lady
who
told
many
lies
,
as
Lizzie
knew
well
,
 
and
surely
could
not
be
horrified
at
a
lie
told
in
such
circumstances
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
not
in
Lizzie
's
nature
to
trust
a
woman
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
would
tell
Lord
George
,
 
and
that
would
destroy
everything
.
<EOS>
When
she
thought
of
confiding
everything
to
her
cousin
,
it
was
always
in
his
absence
.
<EOS>
The
idea
became
dreadful
to
her
as
soon
as
he
was
present
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
dare
to
own
to
him
that
she
had
sworn
falsely
to
the
magistrate
at
Carlisle
.
<EOS>
And
so
the
burthen
had
to
be
borne
,
increasing
every
hour
in
weight
,
and
the
poor
creature
's
back
was
not
broad
enough
to
bear
it
.
<EOS>
She
thought
of
the
necklace
every
waking
minute
,
and
dreamed
of
it
when
she
slept
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
keep
herself
from
unlocking
her
desk
and
looking
at
it
twenty
times
a
day
,
although
she
knew
the
peril
of
such
nervous
solicitude
.
<EOS>
If
she
could
only
rid
herself
of
it
altogether
,
she
was
sure
now
that
she
would
do
so
.
<EOS>
She
would
throw
it
into
the
ocean
fathoms
deep
,
if
only
she
could
find
herself
alone
upon
the
ocean
.
<EOS>
But
she
felt
that
,
let
her
go
where
she
might
,
she
would
be
watched
.
<EOS>
She
might
declare
to
-
morrow
her
intention
of
going
to
Ireland
,
 
or
,
for
that
matter
,
to
America
.
<EOS>
But
,
were
she
to
do
so
,
some
horrid
policeman
would
be
on
her
track
.
<EOS>
The
iron
box
had
been
a
terrible
nuisance
to
her
;
 
but
the
iron
box
had
been
as
nothing
compared
to
the
necklace
locked
up
in
her
desk
.
<EOS>
From
day
to
day
she
meditated
a
plan
of
taking
the
thing
out
into
the
streets
,
and
dropping
it
in
the
dark
;
but
she
was
sure
that
,
were
she
to
do
so
,
some
one
would
have
watched
her
while
she
dropped
it
.
<EOS>
She
was
unwilling
to
trust
her
old
friend
Mr.
Benjamin
;
but
in
these
days
her
favourite
scheme
was
to
offer
the
diamonds
for
sale
to
him
at
some
very
low
price
.
<EOS>
If
he
would
help
her
they
might
surely
be
got
out
of
their
present
hiding
-
place
into
his
hands
.
<EOS>
Any
man
would
be
powerful
to
help
,
if
there
were
any
man
whom
she
could
trust
.
<EOS>
In
furtherance
of
this
scheme
she
went
so
far
as
to
break
a
brooch
,
 
a
favourite
brooch
of
her
own
,
 
in
order
that
she
might
have
an
excuse
for
calling
at
the
jewellers
"
.
<EOS>
But
even
this
she
postponed
from
day
to
day
.
<EOS>
Circumstances
,
as
they
had
occurred
,
had
taught
her
to
believe
that
the
police
could
not
insist
on
breaking
open
her
desk
unless
some
evidence
could
be
brought
against
her
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
evidence
,
and
her
desk
was
so
far
safe
.
<EOS>
But
the
same
circumstances
had
made
her
understand
that
she
was
already
suspected
of
some
intrigue
with
reference
to
the
diamonds
,
 
though
of
what
she
was
suspected
she
did
not
clearly
perceive
.
<EOS>
As
far
as
she
could
divine
the
thoughts
of
her
enemies
,
they
did
not
seem
to
suppose
that
the
diamonds
were
in
her
possession
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
to
be
believed
by
those
enemies
that
they
had
passed
into
the
hands
of
Lord
George
.
<EOS>
As
long
as
her
enemies
were
on
a
scent
so
false
,
might
it
not
be
best
that
she
should
remain
quiet
?
  
<EOS>
But
all
the
ingenuity
,
the
concentrated
force
,
and
trained
experience
of
the
police
of
London
would
surely
be
too
great
and
powerful
for
her
in
the
long
run
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
hope
to
keep
her
secret
and
the
diamonds
till
they
should
acknowledge
themselves
to
be
baffled
.
<EOS>
And
then
she
was
aware
of
a
morbid
desire
on
her
own
part
to
tell
the
secret
,
 
of
a
desire
that
amounted
almost
to
a
disease
.
<EOS>
It
would
soon
burst
her
bosom
open
,
unless
she
could
share
her
knowledge
with
some
one
.
<EOS>
And
yet
,
as
she
thought
of
it
all
,
she
told
herself
that
she
had
no
friend
so
fast
and
true
as
to
justify
such
confidence
.
<EOS>
She
was
ill
with
anxiety
,
and
,
 
worse
than
that
<EOS>
,
 
Mrs.
Carbuncle
knew
that
she
was
ill
.
<EOS>
It
was
acknowledged
between
them
that
this
affair
of
the
necklace
was
so
terrible
as
to
make
a
woman
ill
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
at
present
had
been
gracious
enough
to
admit
so
much
as
that
.
<EOS>
But
might
it
not
be
probable
that
Mrs.
Carbuncle
would
come
to
suspect
that
she
did
not
know
the
whole
secret
?
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
had
already
,
on
more
than
one
occasion
,
said
a
little
word
or
two
which
had
been
unpleasant
.
  
<EOS>
Such
was
Lizzie
's
condition
when
Mr.
Bunfit
came
,
with
his
authoritative
request
to
be
allowed
to
inspect
Lizzie
's
boxes
,
 
and
when
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
having
secured
her
own
privacy
,
expressed
her
opinion
that
Mr.
Bunfit
should
be
allowed
to
do
as
he
desired
.
   
<EOS>
Bunfit
and
Gager
 
<EOS>
As
soon
as
the
words
were
out
of
Mrs.
Carbuncle
's
mouth
,
 
those
ill
-
natured
words
in
which
she
expressed
her
assent
to
Mr.
Bunfit
's
proposition
that
a
search
should
be
made
after
the
diamonds
among
all
the
possessions
of
Lady
Eustace
which
were
now
lodged
in
her
own
house
,
 
<EOS>
poor
Lizzie
's
courage
deserted
her
entirely
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
very
courageous
;
for
,
though
her
powers
of
endurance
had
sometimes
nearly
deserted
her
,
though
her
heart
had
often
failed
her
,
still
she
had
gone
on
and
had
endured
and
been
silent
.
<EOS>
To
endure
and
to
be
silent
in
her
position
did
require
great
courage
.
<EOS>
She
was
all
alone
in
her
misery
,
and
could
see
no
way
out
of
it
.
<EOS>
The
diamonds
were
heavy
as
a
load
of
lead
within
her
bosom
.
<EOS>
And
yet
she
had
persevered
.
<EOS>
Now
,
as
she
heard
Mrs.
Carbuncle
's
words
,
her
courage
failed
her
.
<EOS>
There
came
some
obstruction
in
her
throat
,
so
that
she
could
not
speak
.
<EOS>
She
felt
as
though
her
heart
were
breaking
.
<EOS>
She
put
out
both
her
hands
and
could
not
draw
them
back
again
.
<EOS>
She
knew
that
she
was
betraying
herself
by
her
weakness
.
<EOS>
She
could
just
hear
the
man
explaining
that
the
search
was
merely
a
thing
of
ceremony
,
 
just
to
satisfy
everybody
that
there
was
no
mistake
;
 
and
then
she
fainted
.
<EOS>
So
far
,
Barrington
Erle
was
correct
in
the
information
given
by
him
to
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
She
pressed
one
hand
against
her
heart
,
gasped
for
breath
,
and
then
fell
back
upon
the
sofa
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
she
could
have
done
nothing
better
.
<EOS>
Had
the
fainting
been
counterfeit
,
the
measure
would
have
shown
ability
.
<EOS>
But
the
fainting
was
altogether
true
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
first
,
and
then
Mr.
Bunfit
,
hurried
from
their
seats
to
help
her
.
<EOS>
To
neither
of
them
did
it
occur
for
a
moment
that
the
fit
was
false
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
whole
thing
has
been
too
much
for
her
,
"
said
Mrs.
Carbuncle
severely
,
ringing
the
bell
at
the
same
time
for
further
aid
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
doubt
,
 
mum
;
no
doubt
.
<EOS>
We
has
to
see
a
deal
of
this
sort
of
thing
.
<EOS>
Just
a
little
air
,
if
you
please
,
mum
,
 
and
as
much
water
as'd
go
to
christen
a
babby
.
<EOS>
That
's
always
best
,
mum
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
'll
have
the
kindness
to
stand
on
one
side
,
"
said
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
as
she
stretched
Lizzie
on
the
sofa
.
  
<EOS>
"
Certainly
,
mum
,
"
said
Bunfit
,
standing
erect
by
the
wall
,
but
not
showing
the
slightest
disposition
to
leave
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
had
better
go
,
"
said
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
 
loudly
and
very
severely
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
just
stay
and
see
her
come
to
,
mum
.
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
do
her
a
morsel
of
harm
,
mum
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
they
faints
at
the
very
fust
sight
of
such
as
we
;
but
we
has
to
bear
it
.
<EOS>
A
little
more
air
,
if
you
could
,
mum
;
 
and
just
dash
the
water
on
in
drops
like
.
<EOS>
They
feels
a
drop
more
than
they
would
a
bucketful
,
 
<EOS>
and
then
when
they
comes
to
they
has
n't
to
change
theirselves
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Bunfit
's
advice
,
founded
on
much
experience
,
was
good
,
and
Lizzie
gradually
came
to
herself
and
opened
her
eyes
.
<EOS>
She
immediately
clutched
at
her
breast
,
feeling
for
her
key
.
<EOS>
She
found
it
unmoved
,
but
before
her
finger
had
recognised
the
touch
,
her
quick
mind
had
told
her
how
wrong
the
movement
had
been
.
<EOS>
It
had
been
lost
upon
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
but
not
on
Mr.
Bunfit
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
at
once
think
that
she
had
the
diamonds
in
her
desk
;
but
he
felt
almost
sure
that
there
was
something
in
her
possession
,
 
probably
some
document
,
 
which
,
if
found
,
would
place
him
on
the
track
of
the
diamonds
.
<EOS>
But
he
could
not
compel
a
search
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Your
ladyship'll
soon
be
better
,
"
said
Bunfit
graciously
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
endeavoured
to
smile
as
she
expressed
her
assent
to
this
proposition
.
<EOS>
"
As
I
was
a
saying
to
the
elder
lady
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
Saying
to
who
,
sir
?
"
exclaimed
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
rising
up
in
wrath
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Elder
,
indeed
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
As
I
was
a
venturing
to
explain
,
these
fits
of
fainting
come
often
in
our
way
.
<EOS>
Thieves
,
mum
,
 
that
is
,
the
regulars
,
 
do
n't
mind
us
a
bit
,
and
the
women
is
more
hardeneder
than
the
men
;
but
when
we
has
to
speak
to
a
lady
,
it
is
so
often
that
she
goes
off
like
that
!
<EOS>
I
've
known
"
<EOS>
em
do
it
just
at
being
looked
at
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
n't
you
think
,
sir
,
that
you
'd
better
leave
us
now
?
"
said
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
you
had
,
"
said
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
fit
for
nothing
just
at
present
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
wo
n't
disturb
your
ladyship
the
least
in
life
,
"
said
Mr.
Bunfit
,
"
if
you
'll
only
just
let
us
have
your
keys
.
<EOS>
Your
servant
can
be
with
us
,
and
we
wo
n't
move
one
tittle
of
anything
.
"
<EOS>
But
Lizzie
,
though
she
was
still
suffering
that
ineffable
sickness
which
always
accompanies
and
follows
a
real
fainting
-
fit
,
would
not
surrender
her
keys
.
<EOS>
Already
had
an
excuse
for
not
doing
so
occurred
to
her
.
<EOS>
But
for
a
while
she
seemed
to
hesitate
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
demand
it
,
Lady
Eustace
,
"
said
Mr.
Bunfit
,
"
but
if
you
'll
allow
me
to
say
so
<EOS>
,
I
do
think
it
will
look
better
for
your
ladyship
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
take
no
step
without
consulting
my
cousin
,
Mr.
Greystock
,
"
said
Lizzie
;
and
having
thought
of
this
she
adhered
to
it
.
<EOS>
The
detective
supplied
her
with
many
reasons
for
giving
up
her
keys
,
alleging
that
it
would
do
no
harm
,
and
that
her
refusal
would
create
infinite
suspicions
.
<EOS>
But
Lizzie
had
formed
her
answer
and
stuck
to
it
.
<EOS>
She
always
consulted
her
cousin
,
and
always
acted
upon
his
advice
.
<EOS>
He
had
already
cautioned
her
not
to
take
any
steps
without
his
sanction
.
<EOS>
She
would
do
nothing
till
he
consented
.
<EOS>
If
Mr.
Bunfit
would
see
Mr.
Greystock
,
and
if
Mr.
Greystock
would
come
to
her
and
tell
her
to
submit
,
 
she
would
submit
.
<EOS>
Ill
as
she
was
,
she
could
be
obstinate
,
and
Bunfit
left
the
house
without
having
been
able
to
finger
that
key
<EOS>
which
he
felt
sure
that
Lady
Eustace
carried
somewhere
on
her
person
.
  
<EOS>
As
he
walked
back
to
his
own
quarters
in
Scotland
Yard
,
Bunfit
was
by
no
means
dissatisfied
with
his
morning
's
work
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
expected
to
find
anything
with
Lady
Eustace
,
and
,
when
she
fainted
,
had
not
hoped
to
be
allowed
to
search
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
now
sure
that
her
ladyship
was
possessed
,
at
any
rate
,
of
some
guilty
knowledge
.
<EOS>
Bunfit
was
one
of
those
who
,
almost
from
the
first
,
had
believed
that
the
box
was
empty
when
taken
out
of
the
hotel
.
<EOS>
"
Stones
like
them
must
turn
up
more
or
less
,
"
was
Bunfit
's
great
argument
.
<EOS>
That
the
police
should
already
have
found
the
stones
themselves
was
not
perhaps
probable
;
but
had
any
ordinary
thieves
had
them
in
their
hands
,
they
could
not
have
been
passed
on
without
leaving
a
trace
behind
them
.
<EOS>
It
was
his
opinion
that
the
box
had
been
opened
and
the
door
cut
by
the
instrumentality
and
concurrence
of
Lord
George
de
Bruce
Carruthers
,
 
with
the
assistance
of
some
well
-
skilled
mechanical
thief
.
<EOS>
Nothing
could
be
made
out
of
the
tall
footman
;
 
indeed
,
the
tall
footman
had
already
been
set
at
liberty
,
although
he
was
known
to
have
evil
associates
;
and
the
tall
footman
was
now
loud
in
demanding
compensation
for
the
injury
done
to
him
.
<EOS>
Many
believed
that
the
tall
footman
had
been
concerned
in
the
matter
,
 
many
,
that
is
,
among
the
experienced
craftsmen
of
the
police
force
.
<EOS>
Bunfit
thought
otherwise
.
<EOS>
Bunfit
believed
that
the
diamonds
were
now
either
in
the
possession
of
Lord
George
or
of
Harter
and
Benjamin
,
that
they
had
been
handed
over
to
Lord
George
to
save
them
from
Messrs.
Camperdown
and
the
lawsuit
,
and
that
Lord
George
and
the
lady
were
lovers
.
<EOS>
The
lady
's
conduct
at
their
last
interview
,
her
fit
of
fainting
,
and
her
clutching
for
the
key
,
all
confirmed
Bunfit
in
his
opinion
.
<EOS>
But
unfortunately
for
Bunfit
he
was
almost
alone
in
his
opinion
.
<EOS>
There
were
men
in
the
force
,
 
high
in
their
profession
as
detectives
,
 
who
avowed
that
certainly
two
very
experienced
and
well
-
known
thieves
had
been
concerned
in
the
business
.
<EOS>
That
a
certain
Mr.
Smiler
had
been
there
,
 
a
gentleman
for
whom
the
whole
police
of
London
entertained
a
feeling
which
approached
to
veneration
,
and
that
most
diminutive
of
full
-
grown
thieves
,
Billy
Cann
,
 
most
diminutive
but
at
the
same
time
most
expert
,
 
was
not
doubted
by
some
minds
which
were
apt
to
doubt
till
conviction
had
become

<EOS>
The
traveller
who
had
left
the
Scotch
train
at
Dumfries
had
been
a
very
small
man
,
and
it
was
a
known
fact
that
Mr.
Smiler
had
left
London
by
train
,
from
the
Euston
Square
station
,
on
the
day
before
that
on
which
Lizzie
and
her
party
had
reached
Carlisle
.
<EOS>
If
it
were
so
,
if
Mr.
Smiler
and
Billy
Cann
had
both
been
at
work
at
the
hotel
,
then
,
 
so
argued
they
who
opposed
the
Bunfit
theory
,
 
it
was
hardly
conceivable
that
the
robbery
should
have
been
arranged
by
Lord
George
.
<EOS>
According
to
the
Bunfit
theory
,
the
only
thing
needed
by
the
conspirators
had
been
that
the
diamonds
should
be
handed
over
by
Lady
Eustace
to
Lord
George
in
such
a
way
as
to
escape
suspicion
that
such
transfer
had
been
made
.
<EOS>
This
might
have
been
done
with
very
little
trouble
,
 
by
simply
leaving
the
box
empty
,
with
the
key
in
it
.
<EOS>
The
door
of
the
bedroom
had
been
opened
by
skilful
professional
men
,
and
the
box
had
been
forced
by
the
use
of
tools
which
none
but
professional
gentlemen
would
possess
.
<EOS>
Was
it
probable
that
Lord
George
would
have
committed
himself
with
such
men
,
and
incurred
the
very
heavy
expense
of
paying
for
their
services
,
when
he
was
,
 
according
to
the
Bunfit
theory
,
 
able
to
get
at
the
diamonds
without
any
such
trouble
,
danger
,
and
expenditure
?
<EOS>
There
was
a
young
detective
in
the
force
,
very
clever
,
 
almost
too
clever
,
and
certainly
a
little
too
fast
,
 
Gager
by
name
,
who
declared
that
the
Bunfit
theory
"
warn't
<EOS>
on
the
cards
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
According
to
Gager
's
information
,
Smiler
was
at
this
moment
a
broken
-
hearted
man
,
 
ranging
between
mad
indignation
and
suicidal
despondency
,
because
he
had
been
treated
with
treachery
in
some
direction
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Gager
was
as
fully
convinced
as
Bunfit
that
the
diamonds
had
not
been
in
the
box
.
<EOS>
There
was
bitter
,
raging
,
heart
-
breaking
disappointment
about
the
diamonds
in
more
quarters
than
one
.
<EOS>
That
there
had
been
a
double
robbery
Gager
was
quite
sure
;
 
or
rather
a
robbery
in
which
two
sets
of
thieves
had
been
concerned
,
and
in
which
one
set
had
been
duped
by
the
other
set
.
<EOS>
In
this
affair
Mr.
Smiler
and
poor
little
Billy
Cann
had
been
the
dupes
.
<EOS>
So
far
Gager
's
mind
had
arrived
at
certainty
.
<EOS>
But
then
how
had
they
been
duped
,
and
who
had
duped
them
?
<EOS>
And
who
had
employed
them
?
<EOS>
Such
a
robbery
would
hardly
have
been
arranged
and
executed
except
on
commission
.
<EOS>
Even
Mr.
Smiler
would
not
have
burthened
himself
with
such
diamonds
without
knowing
what
to
do
with
them
,
and
what
he
should
get
for
them
.
<EOS>
That
they
were
intended
ultimately
for
the
hands
of
Messrs.
Harter
and
Benjamin
,
Gager
almost
believed
.
<EOS>
And
Gager
was
inclined
to
think
that
Messrs.
Harter
and
Benjamin
,
 
or
rather
Mr.
Benjamin
,
for
Mr.
Harter
himself
was
almost
too
old
for
work
requiring
so
very
great
mental
activity
,
 
that
Mr.
Benjamin
,
fearing
the
honesty
of
his
executive
officer
Mr.
Smiler
,
had
been
splendidly
treacherous
to
his
subordinate
.
<EOS>
Gager
had
not
quite
completed
his
theory
;
but
he
was
very
firm
on
one
great
point
,
 
that
the
thieves
at
Carlisle
had
been
genuine
thieves
,
thinking
that
they
were
stealing
the
diamonds
,
and
finding
their
mistake
out
when
the
box
had
been
opened
by
them
under
the
bridge
.
<EOS>
"
Who
have
"
em
,
then
?
"
asked
Bunfit
of
his
younger
brother
,
in
a
disparaging
whisper
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
;
yes
;
who
"
ave
"
em
?
<EOS>
It
's
easy
to
say
,
who
"
ave
"
em
?
<EOS>
Suppose
"
e
"
ave
"
em
.
"
<EOS>
The
"
he
"
alluded
to
by
Gager
was
Lord
George
de
Bruce
Carruthers
.
"
<EOS>
But
laws
,
Bunfit
,
they
're
gone
 
weeks
ago
.
<EOS>
You
know
that
,
Bunfit
.
<EOS>
"
This
had
occurred
before
the
intended
search
among
poor
Lizzie
's
boxes
,
but
Bunfit
's
theory
had
not
been
shaken
.
<EOS>
Bunfit
could
see
all
round
his
own
theory
.
<EOS>
It
was
whole
,
and
the
motives
as
well
as
the
operations
of
the
persons
concerned
were
explained
by
it
.
<EOS>
But
the
Gager
theory
only
went
to
show
what
had
not
been
done
,
and
offered
no
explanation
of
the
accomplished
scheme
.
<EOS>
Then
Bunfit
went
a
little
further
in
his
theory
,
not
disdaining
to
accept
something
from
Gager
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
Lord
George
had
engaged
these
men
,
and
had
afterwards
found
it
practicable
to
get
the
diamonds
without
their
assistance
.
<EOS>
On
one
great
point
all
concerned
in
the
inquiry
were
in
unison
,
 
that
the
diamonds
had
not
been
in
the
box
when
it
was
carried
out
of
the
bedroom
at
Carlisle
.
<EOS>
The
great
point
of
difference
consisted
in
this
,
that
whereas
Gager
was
sure
that
the
robbery
when
committed
had
been
genuine
,
Bunfit
was
of
opinion
that
the
box
had
been
first
opened
,
and
then
taken
out
of
the
hotel
in
order
that
the
police
might
be
put
on
a
wrong
track
.
  
<EOS>
The
matter
was
becoming
very
important
.
<EOS>
Two
or
three
of
the
leading
newspapers
had
first
hinted
at
and
then
openly
condemned
the
incompetence
and
slowness
of
the
police
.
<EOS>
Such
censure
,
as
we
all
know
,
is
very
common
,
and
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
it
is
unjust
.
<EOS>
They
who
write
it
probably
know
but
little
of
the
circumstances
;
 
and
,
in
speaking
of
a
failure
here
and
a
failure
there
,
make
no
reference
to
the
numerous
successes
,
which
are
so
customary
as
to
partake
of
the
nature
of
routine
.
<EOS>
It
is
the
same
in
regard
to
all
public
matters
,
 
army
matters
,
navy
matters
,
poor
-
law
matters
,
and
post
-
office
matters
.
<EOS>
Day
after
day
,
and
almost
every
day
,
one
meets
censure
which
is
felt
to
be
unjust
;
 
but
the
general
result
of
all
this
injustice
is
increased
efficiency
.
<EOS>
The
coach
does
go
the
faster
because
of
the
whip
in
the
coachman
's
hand
,
though
the
horses
driven
may
never
have
deserved
the
thong
.
<EOS>
In
this
matter
of
the
Eustace
diamonds
the
police
had
been
very
active
;
but
they
had
been
unsuccessful
,
and
had
consequently
been
abused
.
<EOS>
The
robbery
was
now
more
than
three
weeks
old
.
<EOS>
Property
to
the
amount
of
ten
thousand
pounds
had
been
abstracted
,
and
as
yet
the
police
had
not
even
formed
an
assured
opinion
on
the
subject
!
<EOS>
Had
the
same
thing
occurred
in
New
York
or
Paris
every
diamond
would
by
this
time
have
been
traced
.
<EOS>
Such
were
the
assertions
made
,
and
the
police
were
instigated
to
new
exertions
.
<EOS>
Bunfit
would
have
jeopardised
his
right
hand
,
and
Gager
his
life
,
to
get
at
the
secret
.
<EOS>
Even
Major
Mackintosh
was
anxious
.
  
<EOS>
The
facts
of
the
claim
made
by
Mr.
Camperdown
,
and
of
the
bill
which
had
been
filed
in
Chancery
for
the
recovery
of
the
diamonds
,
were
of
course
widely
known
,
and
added
much
to
the
general
interest
and
complexity
.
<EOS>
It
was
averred
that
Mr.
Camperdown
's
determination
to
get
the
diamonds
had
been
very
energetic
,
and
Lady
Eustace
's
determination
to
keep
them
equally
so
.
<EOS>
Wonderful
stories
were
told
of
Lizzie
's
courage
,
energy
,
and
resolution
.
<EOS>
There
was
hardly
a
lawyer
of
repute
but
took
up
the
question
,
and
had
an
opinion
as
to
Lizzie
's
right
to
the
necklace
.
<EOS>
The
Attorney
and
Solicitor
-
General
were
dead
against
her
,
asserting
that
the
diamonds
certainly
did
not
pass
to
her
under
the
will
,
and
could
not
have
become
hers
by
gift
.
<EOS>
But
they
were
members
of
a
Liberal
government
,
and
of
course
anti
-
Lizzieite
.
<EOS>
Gentlemen
who
were
equal
to
them
in
learning
,
who
had
held
offices
equally
high
,
were
distinctly
of
a
different
opinion
.
<EOS>
Lady
Eustace
might
probably
claim
the
jewels
as
paraphernalia
properly
appertaining
to
her
rank
;
 
in
which
claim
the
bestowal
of
them
by
her
husband
would
no
doubt
assist
her
.
<EOS>
And
to
these
gentlemen
,
 
who
were
Lizzieites
and
of
course
Conservatives
in
politics
,
 
<EOS>
it
was
by
no
means
clear
that
the
diamonds
did
not
pass
to
her
by
will
.
<EOS>
If
it
could
be
shown
that
the
diamonds
had
been
lately
kept
in
Scotland
,
the
ex
-
Attorney
-
General
thought
that
they
would
so
pass
.
<EOS>
All
which
questions
,
now
that
the
jewels
had
been
lost
,
were
discussed
openly
,
and
added
greatly
to
the
anxiety
of
the
police
.
<EOS>
Both
Lizzieites
and
anti
-
Lizzieites
were
disposed
to
think
that
Lizzie
was
very
clever
.
  
<EOS>
Frank
Greystock
in
these
days
took
up
his
cousin
's
part
altogether
in
good
faith
.
<EOS>
He
entertained
not
the
slightest
suspicion
that
she
was
deceiving
him
in
regard
to
the
diamonds
.
<EOS>
That
the
robbery
had
been
a
bona
-
fide
robbery
,
and
that
Lizzie
had
lost
her
treasure
,
was
to
him
beyond
doubt
.
<EOS>
He
had
gradually
convinced
himself
that
Mr.
Camperdown
was
wrong
in
his
claim
,
and
was
strongly
of
opinion
that
Lord
Fawn
had
disgraced
himself
by
his
conduct
to
the
lady
.
<EOS>
When
he
now
heard
,
as
he
did
hear
,
that
some
undefined
suspicion
was
attached
to
his
cousin
,
 
and
when
he
heard
also
,
as
unfortunately
he
did
hear
,
 
that
Lord
Fawn
had
encouraged
that
suspicion
<EOS>
,
he
was
very
irate
,
and
said
grievous
things
of
Lord
Fawn
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
to
him
to
be
the
extremity
of
cruelty
that
suspicion
should
be
attached
to
his
cousin
because
she
had
been
robbed
of
her
jewels
.
<EOS>
He
was
among
those
who
were
most
severe
in
their
denunciation
of
the
police
,
 
and
was
the
more
so
,
because
he
had
heard
it
asserted
that
the
necklace
had
not
in
truth
been
stolen
.
<EOS>
He
busied
himself
very
much
in
the
matter
,
and
even
interrogated
John
Eustace
as
to
his
intentions
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
fellow
,
"
said
Eustace
,
"
if
you
hated
those
diamonds
as
much
as
I
do
,
you
would
never
mention
them
again
.
"
<EOS>
Greystock
declared
that
this
expression
of
aversion
to
the
subject
might
be
all
very
well
for
Mr.
Eustace
,
but
that
he
found
himself
bound
to
defend
his
cousin
.
<EOS>
"
You
can
not
defend
her
against
me
,
"
said
Eustace
,
"
for
I
do
not
attack
her
.
<EOS>
I
have
never
said
a
word
against
her
.
<EOS>
I
went
down
to
Portray
when
she
asked
me
.
<EOS>
As
far
as
I
am
concerned
she
is
perfectly
welcome
to
wear
the
necklace
,
if
she
can
get
it
back
again
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
make
or
meddle
in
the
matter
one
way
or
the
other
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Frank
,
after
that
,
went
to
Mr.
Camperdown
,
but
he
could
get
no
satisfaction
from
the
attorney
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Camperdown
would
only
say
that
he
had
a
duty
to
do
,
and
that
he
must
do
it
.
<EOS>
On
the
matter
of
the
robbery
he
refused
to
give
an
opinion
.
<EOS>
That
was
in
the
hands
of
the
police
.
<EOS>
Should
the
diamonds
be
recovered
,
he
would
,
of
course
,
claim
them
on
behalf
of
the
estate
.
<EOS>
In
his
opinion
,
whether
the
diamonds
were
recovered
or
not
,
Lady
Eustace
was
responsible
to
the
estate
for
their
value
.
<EOS>
In
opposition
,
first
to
the
entreaties
,
and
then
to
the
demands
of
her
late
husband
's
family
,
she
had
insisted
on
absurdly
carrying
about
with
her
an
enormous
amount
of
property
which
did
not
belong
to
her
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Camperdown
opined
that
she
must
pay
for
the
lost
diamonds
out
of
her
jointure
.
<EOS>
Frank
,
in
a
huff
,
declared
that
,
as
far
as
he
could
see
,
the
diamonds
belonged
to
his
cousin
;
 
in
answer
to
which
Mr.
Camperdown
suggested
that
the
question
was
one
for
the
decision
of
the
Vice
-
Chancellor
.
<EOS>
Frank
Greystock
found
that
he
could
do
nothing
with
Mr.
Camperdown
,
and
felt
that
he
could
wreak
his
vengeance
only
on
Lord
Fawn
.
  
<EOS>
Bunfit
,
when
he
returned
from
Mrs.
Carbuncle
's
house
to
Scotland
Yard
,
had
an
interview
with
Major
Mackintosh
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
Bunfit
,
have
you
seen
the
lady
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
 
I
did
see
her
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
came
of
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
fainted
away
,
sir
 
just
as
they
always
do
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
was
no
search
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
No
,
sir
;
 
no
search
.
<EOS>
She
would
n't
have
it
,
unless
her
cousin
,
Mr.
Greystock
,
permitted
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
think
she
would
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nor
yet
did
n't
I
,
sir
.
<EOS>
But
I
'll
tell
you
what
it
is
,
major
.
<EOS>
She
knows
all
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
think
she
does
,
Bunfit
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
does
,
sir
;
and
she
's
got
something
locked
up
somewhere
in
that
house
<EOS>
as'd
elucidate
the
whole
of
this
aggravating
mystery
,
if
only
we
could
get
at
it
.
<EOS>
Major
,
 
"
  
"
Well
,
Bunfit
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
ai
n't
noways
sure
as
she
ai
n't
got
them
very
diamonds
themselves
<EOS>
locked
up
,
or
,
perhaps
,
tied
round
her
person
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Neither
am
I
sure
that
she
has
not
,
"
said
the
major
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
robbery
at
Carlisle
was
no
robbery
,
"
continued
Bunfit
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
a
got
-
up
plant
,
and
about
the
best
as
I
ever
knowed
.
<EOS>
It
's
my
mind
that
it
was
a
got
-
up
plant
between
her
ladyship
and
his
lordship
;
and
either
the
one
or
the
other
is
just
keeping
the
diamonds
till
it
's
safe
to
take

em
into
the

In
Hertford
Street
 
<EOS>
During
all
this
time
Lucinda
Roanoke
was
engaged
to
marry
Sir
Griffin
Tewett
,
and
the
lover
was
an
occasional
visitor
in
Hertford
Street
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
was
as
anxious
as
ever
that
the
marriage
should
be
celebrated
on
the
appointed
day
,
and
though
there
had
been
repeated
quarrels
,
nothing
had
as
yet
taken
place
to
make
her
despond
.
<EOS>
Sir
Griffin
would
make
some
offensive
speech
;
Lucinda
would
tell
him
that
she
had
no
desire
ever
to
see
him
again
;
and
then
the
baronet
,
usually
under
the
instigation
of
Lord
George
,
would
make
some
awkward
apology
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
 
whose
life
at
this
period
was
not
a
pleasant
one
,
 
would
behave
on
such
occasions
with
great
patience
,
and
sometimes
with
great
courage
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
,
who
in
her
present
emergency
could
not
bear
the
idea
of
losing
the
assistance
of
any
friend
,
was
soft
and
graceful
,
and
even
gracious
,
to
the
bear
.
<EOS>
The
bear
himself
certainly
seemed
to
desire
the
marriage
,
though
he
would
so
often
give
offence
which
made
any
prospect
of
a
marriage
almost
impossible
.
<EOS>
But
with
Sir
Griffin
,
when
the
prize
seemed
to
be
lost
,
it
again
became
valuable
.
<EOS>
He
would
talk
about
his
passionate
love
to
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
and
to
Lizzie
,
 
and
then
,
when
things
had
been
made
straight
for
him
,
he
would
insult
them
,
and
neglect
Lucinda
.
<EOS>
To
Lucinda
herself
,
however
,
he
would
rarely
dare
to
say
such
words
as
he
used
daily
to
the
other
two
ladies
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
What
could
have
been
the
man
's
own
idea
of
his
future
married
life
,
how
can
any
reader
be
made
to
understand
,
or
any
writer
adequately
describe
!
<EOS>
He
must
have
known
that
the
woman
despised
him
,
and
hated
him
.
<EOS>
In
the
very
bottom
of
his
heart
he
feared
her
.
<EOS>
He
had
no
idea
of
other
pleasure
from
her
society
than
what
might
arise
to
him
from
the
pride
of
having
married
a
beautiful
woman
.
<EOS>
Had
she
shown
the
slightest
fondness
for
him
,
the
slightest
fear
that
she
might
lose
him
,
the
slightest
feeling
that
she
had
won
a
valuable
prize
in
getting
him
,
he
would
have
scorned
her
,
and
jilted
her
without
the
slightest
remorse
.
<EOS>
But
the
scorn
came
from
her
,
and
it
beat
him
down
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
;
 
you
hate
me
,
and
would
fain
be
rid
of
me
;
but
you
have
said
that
you
will
be
my
wife
,
and
you
can
not
now
escape
me
.
"
<EOS>
Sir
Griffin
did
not
exactly
speak
such
words
as
these
,
but
he
acted
them
.
<EOS>
Lucinda
would
bear
his
presence
,
 
sitting
apart
from
him
,
silent
,
imperious
,
but
very
beautiful
.
<EOS>
People
said
that
she
became
more
handsome
from
day
to
day
,
and
she
did
so
,
in
spite
of
her
agony
.
<EOS>
Hers
was
a
face
which
could
stand
such
condition
of
the
heart
without
fading
or
sinking
under
it
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
weep
,
or
lose
her
colour
,
or
become
thin
.
<EOS>
The
pretty
softness
of
a
girl
,
 
delicate
feminine
weakness
,
or
laughing
eyes
and
pouting
lips
,
no
one
expected
from
her
.
<EOS>
Sir
Griffin
,
in
the
early
days
of
their
acquaintance
,
had
found
her
to
be
a
woman
with
a
character
for
beauty
,
 
and
she
was
now
more
beautiful
than
ever
.
<EOS>
He
probably
thought
that
he
loved
her
;
but
,
at
any
rate
,
he
was
determined
that
he
would
marry
her
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
expressed
himself
more
than
once
as
very
angry
about
this
affair
of
the
jewels
.
<EOS>
He
had
told
Mrs.
Carbuncle
that
her
inmate
,
Lady
Eustace
,
was
suspected
by
the
police
,
and
that
it
might
be
well
that
Lady
Eustace
should
be
 
be
made
to
go
,
in
fact
.
<EOS>
But
it
did
not
suit
Mrs.
Carbuncle
that
Lady
Eustace
should
be
made
to
go
;
 
nor
did
it
suit
Lord
George
de
Bruce
Carruthers
.
<EOS>
Lord
George
,
at
Mrs.
Carbuncle
's
instance
,
had
snubbed
Sir
Griffin
more
than
once
,
and
then
it
came
to
pass
that
he
was
snubbed
yet
again
more
violently
than
before
.
<EOS>
He
was
at
the
house
in
Hertford
Street
on
the
day
of
Mr.
Bunfit
's
visit
,
some
hours
after
Mr.
Bunfit
was
gone
,
when
Lizzie
was
still
lying
on
her
bed
up
-
stairs
,
nearly
beaten
by
the
great
danger
which
had
oppressed
her
.
<EOS>
He
was
told
of
Mr.
Bunfit
's
visit
,
and
then
again
said
that
he
thought
that
the
continued
residence
of
Lady
Eustace
beneath
that
roof
was
a
misfortune
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Would
you
wish
us
to
turn
her
out
because
her
necklace
has
been
stolen
?
"
asked
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
  
<EOS>
"
People
say
very
queer
things
,
"
said
Sir
Griffin
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
they
do
,
Sir
Griffin
,
"
continued
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
<EOS>
"
They
say
such
queer
things
that
I
can
hardly
understand
that
they
should
be
allowed
to
say
them
.
<EOS>
I
am
told
that
the
police
absolutely
suggest
that
Lord
George
stole
the
diamonds
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
nonsense
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
No
doubt
,
Sir
Griffin
.
<EOS>
And
so
is
the
other
nonsense
.
<EOS>
Do
you
mean
to
tell
us
that
you
believe
that
Lady
Eustace
stole
her
own
diamonds
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
see
the
use
of
having
her
here
.
<EOS>
Situated
as
I
am
,
I
have
a
right
to
object
to
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Situated
as
you
are
,
Sir
Griffin
!
"
said
Lucinda
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
;
 
yes
,
of
course
;
if
we
are
to
be
married
,
I
can
not
but
think
a
good
deal
of
the
persons
you
stay
with
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
were
very
glad
to
stay
yourself
with
Lady
Eustace
at
Portray
,
"
said
Lucinda
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
went
there
to
follow
you
,
"
said
Sir
Griffin
gallantly
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
with
all
my
heart
you
had
stayed
away
,
"
said
Lucinda
.
<EOS>
At
that
moment
Lord
George
was
shown
into
the
room
,
and
Miss
Roanoke
continued
speaking
,
determined
that
Lord
George
should
know
how
the
bear
was
conducting
himself
.
"
<EOS>
Sir
Griffin
is
saying
that
my
aunt
ought
to
turn
Lady
Eustace
out
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
quite
that
,
"
said
Sir
Griffin
with
an
attempt
at
laughter
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Quite
that
,
"
said
Lucinda
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
suppose
that
he
suspects
poor
Lady
Eustace
,
but
he
thinks
that
my
aunt
's
friend
should
be
like
Caesar
's
wife
,
above
the
suspicion
of
others
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
would
mind
your
own
business
,
Tewett
,
"
said
Lord
George
,
"
it
would
be
a
deal
better
for
us
all
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
Mrs.
Carbuncle
does
not
turn
you
out
of
the
room
for
making
such
a
proposition
here
.
<EOS>
If
it
were
my
room
,
I
would
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
I
can
say
what
I
please
to
Mrs.
Carbuncle
?
<EOS>
Miss
Roanoke
is
not
going
to
be
your
wife
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
my
belief
that
Miss
Roanoke
will
be
nobody
's
wife
,
 
at
any
rate
,
for
the
present
,
"
said
that
young
lady
;
 
upon
which
Sir
Griffin
left
the
room
,
muttering
some
words
which
might
have
been
,
perhaps
,
intended
for
an
adieu
.
<EOS>
Immediately
after
this
,
Lizzie
came
in
,
moving
slowly
,
but
without
a
sound
,
like
a
ghost
,
with
pale
cheeks
and
dishevelled
hair
,
and
that
weary
,
worn
look
of
illness
which
was
become
customary
with
her
.
<EOS>
She
greeted
Lord
George
with
a
faint
attempt
at
a
smile
,
and
seated
herself
in
a
corner
of
a
sofa
.
<EOS>
She
asked
whether
he
had
been
told
the
story
of
the
proposed
search
,
and
then
bade
her
friend
Mrs.
Carbuncle
describe
the
scene
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
it
goes
on
like
this
it
will
kill
me
,
"
said
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
are
treating
me
in
precisely
the
same
way
,
"
said
Lord
George
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
think
of
your
strength
and
of
my
weakness
,
Lord
George
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
By
heavens
,
I
do
n't
know
!
"
said
Lord
George
.
<EOS>
"
In
this
matter
your
weakness
is
stronger
than
any
strength
of
mine
.
<EOS>
I
never
was
so
cut
up
in
my
life
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
good
joke
when
we
talked
of
the
suspicions
of
that
fellow
at
Carlisle
as
we
came
up
by
the
railway
,
 
<EOS>
but
it
is
no
joke
now
.
<EOS>
I
've
had
men
with
me
,
almost
asking
to
search
among
my
things
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
have
quite
asked
me
!
"
said
Lizzie
piteously
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
;
 
yes
.
<EOS>
But
there
's
some
reason
in
that
.
<EOS>
These
infernal
diamonds
did
belong
to
you
,
or
,
at
any
rate
,
you
had
them
.
<EOS>
You
are
the
last
person
known
to
have
seen
them
.
<EOS>
Even
if
you
had
them
still
,
you
'd
only
have
what
you
call
your
own
.
"
<EOS>
Lizzie
looked
at
him
with
all
her
eyes
and
listened
to
him
with
all
her
ears
.
"
<EOS>
But
what
the
mischief
can
I
have
had
to
do
with
them
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
very
hard
upon
you
,
"
said
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
  
<EOS>
"
Unless
I
stole
them
,
"
continued
Lord
George
.
  
<EOS>
"
Which
is
so
absurd
,
you
know
,
"
said
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
a
pig
-
headed
provincial
fool
should
have
taken
me
for
a
midnight
thief
,
did
not
disturb
me
much
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
think
I
am
very
easily
annoyed
by
what
other
people
think
of
me
.
<EOS>
But
these
fellows
,
I
suppose
,
were
sent
here
by
the
head
of
the
metropolitan
police
;
and
everybody
knows
that
they
have
been
sent
.
<EOS>
Because
I
was
civil
enough
to
you
women
to
look
after
you
coming
up
to
town
,
and
because
one
of
you
was
careless
enough
to
lose
her
jewels
,
I
 
<EOS>
I
am
to
be
talked
about
all
over
London
as
the
man
who
took
them
!
<EOS>
"
This
was
not
spoken
with
much
courtesy
to
the
ladies
present
.
<EOS>
Lord
George
had
dropped
that
customary
chivalry
of
manner
which
,
in
ordinary
life
,
makes
it
to
be
quite
out
of
the
question
that
a
man
shall
be
uncivil
to
a
woman
.
<EOS>
He
had
escaped
from
conventional
usage
into
rough
,
truthful
speech
,
under
stress
from
the
extremity
of
the
hardship
to
which
he
had
been
subjected
.
<EOS>
And
the
women
understood
it
and
appreciated
it
,
and
liked
it
rather
than
otherwise
.
<EOS>
To
Lizzie
it
seemed
fitting
that
a
Corsair
so
circumstanced
should
be
as
uncivil
as
he
pleased
;
and
Mrs.
Carbuncle
had
long
been
accustomed
to
her
friend
's
moods
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
ca
n't
really
think
it
,
"
said
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
  
<EOS>
"
Somebody
thinks
it
.
<EOS>
I
am
told
that
your
particular
friend
,
Lord
Fawn
,
"
 
this
he
said
,
specially
addressing
Lizzie
,
 
"
has
expressed
a
strong
opinion
that
I
carry
about
the
necklace
always
in
my
pocket
.
<EOS>
I
trust
to
have
the
opportunity
of
wringing
his
neck
some
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
so
wish
you
would
,
"
said
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
not
lose
a
chance
if
I
can
get
it
.
<EOS>
Before
all
this
occurred
I
should
have
said
of
myself
that
nothing
of
the
kind
could
put
me
out
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
think
there
is
a
man
in
the
world
cares
less
what
people
say
of
him
than
I
do
.
<EOS>
I
am
as
indifferent
to
ordinary
tittle
-
tattle
as
a
rhinoceros
.
<EOS>
But
,
by
George
,
 
when
it
comes
to
stealing
ten
thousand
pounds
"
worth
of
diamonds
,
and
the
delicate
attentions
of
all
the
metropolitan
police
,
one
begins
to
feel
that
one
is
vulnerable
.
<EOS>
When
I
get
up
in
the
morning
,
I
half
feel
that
I
shall
be
locked
up
before
night
,
and
I
can
see
in
the
eyes
of
every
man
I
meet
that
he
takes
me
for
the
prince
of
burglars
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
it
is
all
my
fault
,
"
said
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
the
diamonds
had
been
thrown
into
the
sea
,
"
said
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
think
about
them
yourself
?
"
asked
Lucinda
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
what
to
think
.
<EOS>
I
'm
at
a
dead
loss
.
<EOS>
You
know
that
man
Mr.
Benjamin
,
Lady
Eustace
?
<EOS>
"
Lizzie
,
with
a
little
start
,
answered
that
she
did
,
 
that
she
had
had
dealings
with
him
before
her
marriage
,
and
had
once
owed
him
two
or
three
hundred
pounds
.
<EOS>
As
the
man
's
name
had
been
mentioned
,
she
thought
it
better
to
own
as
much
.
"
<EOS>
So
he
tells
me
.
<EOS>
Now
,
in
all
London
,
I
do
n't
suppose
there
is
a
greater
rascal
than
Benjamin
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
know
that
,
"
said
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
did
;
and
with
that
rascal
I
have
had
money
dealings
for
the
last
six
or
seven
years
.
<EOS>
He
has
cashed
bills
for
me
,
and
has
my
name
to
bills
now
,
 
and
Sir
Griffin
's
too
.
<EOS>
I
'm
half
inclined
to
think
that
he
has
got
the
diamonds
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
you
indeed
?
"
said
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Benjamin
!
<EOS>
"
said
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
he
returns
the
compliment
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
does
he
return
it
?
"
asked
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
either
thinks
that
I
've
got
"
em
,
or
he
wants
to
make
me
believe
that
he
thinks
so
.
<EOS>
He
has
n't
dared
to
say
it
;
 
but
that
's
his
intention
.
<EOS>
Such
an
opinion
from
such
a
man
on
such
a
subject
would
be
quite
a
compliment
.
<EOS>
And
I
feel
it
.
<EOS>
But
yet
it
troubles
me
.
<EOS>
You
know
that
greasy
,
Israelitish
smile
of
his
,
Lady
Eustace
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Lizzie
nodded
her
head
and
tried
to
smile
.
<EOS>
"
When
I
asked
him
yesterday
about
the
diamonds
,
he
leered
at
me
and
rubbed
his
hands
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
pretty
little
game
;
 
ai
n't
it
,
Lord
George
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
.
<EOS>
I
told
him
that
I
thought
it
a
very
bad
game
,
and
that
I
hoped
the
police
would
have
the
thief
and
the
necklace
soon
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
been
managed
a
deal
too
well
for
that
,
Lord
George
;
 
do
n't
you
think
so
?
"
<EOS>
"
Lord
George
mimicked
the
Jew
as
he
repeated
the
words
,
and
the
ladies
,
of
course
,
laughed
.
<EOS>
But
poor
Lizzie
's
attempt
at
laughter
was
very
sorry
.
<EOS>
"
I
told
him
to
his
face
that
I
thought
he
had
them
among
his
treasures
.
"
<EOS>
No
,
no
,
no
,
Lord
George
,
"
he
said
,
and
seemed
quite
to
enjoy
the
joke
.
<EOS>
If
he
's
got
them
himself
,
he
ca
n't
think
that
I
have
them
;
 
but
if
he
has
not
,
I
do
n't
doubt
<EOS>
but
he
believes
that
I
have
.
<EOS>
And
I
'll
tell
you
another
person
who
suspects
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
fools
they
are
,
"
said
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
how
that
may
be
.
<EOS>
Sir
Griffin
,
Lucinda
,
is
n't
at
all
sure
<EOS>
but
what
I
have
them
in
my
pocket
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
believe
anything
of
him
,
"
said
Lucinda
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
it
seems
he
can
believe
anything
of
me
.
<EOS>
I
shall
begin
to
think
soon
that
I
did
take
them
,
myself
,
 
or
,
at
any
rate
,
that
I
ought
to
have
done
so
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
what
you
three
women
think
of
it
.
<EOS>
If
you
do
think
I
've
got
"
em
,
do
n't
scruple
to
say
so
.
<EOS>
I
'm
quite
used
to
it
,
and
it
wo
n't
hurt
me
any
further
.
<EOS>
"
The
ladies
again
laughed
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
have
your
suspicions
,
"
continued
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
some
of
the
London
thieves
did
get
them
,
"
said
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
police
say
the
box
was
empty
,
"
said
Lord
George
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
can
the
police
know
?
"
asked
Lucinda
.
<EOS>
"
They
were
n't
there
to
see
.
<EOS>
Of
course
,
the
thieves
would
say
that
they
did
n't
take
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
think
,
Lady
Eustace
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
what
to
think
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
Mr.
Camperdown
did
it
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
Or
the
Lord
Chancellor
,
"
said
Lord
George
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
One
is
just
as
likely
as
the
other
.
<EOS>
I
wish
I
could
get
at
what
you
really
think
.
<EOS>
The
whole
thing
would
be
so
complete
if
all
you
three
suspected
me
.
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
get
out
of
it
all
by
going
to
Paris
or
Kamschatka
,
as
I
should
have
half
a
dozen
detectives
on
my
heels
wherever
I
went
.
<EOS>
I
must
brazen
it
out
here
;
and
the
worst
of
it
is
,
that
I
feel
that
a
look
of
guilt
is
creeping
over
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
sort
of
conviction
growing
upon
me
that
I
shall
be
taken
up
and
tried
,
and
that
a
jury
will
find
me
guilty
.
<EOS>
I
dream
about
it
;
and
if
,
 
as
is
probable
,
 
it
drives
me
mad
,
I
'm
sure
that
I
shall
accuse
myself
in
my
madness
.
<EOS>
There
's
a
fascination
about
it
that
I
ca
n't
explain
or
escape
.
<EOS>
I
go
on
thinking
how
I
would
have
done
it
if
I
did
do
it
.
<EOS>
I
spend
hours
in
calculating
how
much
I
would
have
realised
,
and
where
I
would
have
found
my
market
.
<EOS>
I
could
n't
keep
myself
from
asking
Benjamin
the
other
day
how
much
they
would
be
worth
to
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
did
he
say
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Lizzie
,
who
sat
gazing
upon
the
Corsair
,
and
who
was
now
herself
fascinated
.
<EOS>
Lord
George
was
walking
about
the
room
,
then
sitting
for
a
moment
in
one
chair
and
again
in
another
,
and
after
a
while
leaning
on
the
mantelpiece
.
<EOS>
In
his
speaking
he
addressed
himself
almost
exclusively
to
Lizzie
,
who
could
not
keep
her
eyes
from
his
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
grinned
greasily
,
"
said
the
Corsair
,
"
and
told
me
they
had
already
been
offered
to
him
once
before
by
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
false
,
"
said
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
"
Very
likely
.
<EOS>
And
then
he
said
that
no
doubt
they
'd
fall
into
his
hands
some
day
.
"
<EOS>
Would
n't
it
be
a
game
,
Lord
George
,
"
he
said
,
"
if
,
after
all
,
they
should
be
no
more
than
paste
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
That
made
me
think
he
had
got
them
,
and
that
he
'd
get
paste
diamonds
put
into
the
same
setting
,
 
and
then
give
them
up
with
some
story
of
his
own
making
.
<EOS>
"
You
'd
know
whether
they
were
paste
or
not
;
would
n't
you
,
Lord
George
?
"
he
asked
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
Corsair
,
as
he
repeated
Mr.
Benjamin
's
words
,
imitated
the
Jew
's
manner
so
well
,
that
he
made
Lizzie
shudder
.
<EOS>
"
While
I
was
there
,
a
detective
named
Gager
came
in
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
same
man
who
came
here
,
perhaps
,
"
suggested
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
not
.
<EOS>
He
seemed
to
be
quite
intimate
with
Mr.
Benjamin
,
and
went
on
at
once
about
the
diamonds
.
<EOS>
Benjamin
said
that
they
'd
made
their
way
over
to
Paris
,
and
that
he
'd
heard
of
them
.
<EOS>
I
found
myself
getting
quite
intimate
with
Mr.
Gager
,
who
seemed
hardly
to
scruple
at
showing
that
he
thought
that
Benjamin
and
I
were
confederates
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Camperdown
has
offered
four
hundred
pounds
reward
for
the
jewels
,
 
to
be
paid
on
their
surrender
to
the
hands
of
Mr.
Garnett
,
the
jeweller
.
<EOS>
Gager
declared
that
,
if
any
ordinary
thief
had
them
,
they
would
be
given
up
at
once
for
that
sum
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
true
,
I
suppose
,
"
said
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
would
the
ordinary
thief
get
his
money
without
being
detected
?
<EOS>
Who
would
dare
to
walk
into
Garnett
's
shop
with
the
diamonds
in
his
hands
and
ask
for
the
four
hundred
pounds
?
<EOS>
Besides
,
they
have
been
sold
to
some
one
,
 
and
,
as
I
believe
,
to
my
dear
friend
,
Mr.
Benjamin
.
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
you
ai
n't
a
-
going
anywhere
just
at
present
,
Lord
George
?
"
said
that
fellow
Gager
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
the
devil
's
that
to
you
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
him
.
<EOS>
He
just
laughed
and
shook
his
head
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
doubt
but
that
there
's
a
policeman
about
waiting
till
I
leave
this
house
;
 
or
looking
at
me
now
with
a
magnifying
glass
from
the
windows
at
the
other
side
.
<EOS>
They
've
photographed
me
while
I
'm
going
about
,
and
published
a
list
of
every
hair
on
my
face
in
the
"
Hue
and
Cry
.
<EOS>
"
I
dined
at
the
club
yesterday
,
and
found
a
strange
waiter
.
<EOS>
I
feel
certain
that
he
was
a
policeman
done
up
in
livery
all
for
my
sake
.
<EOS>
I
turned
sharp
round
in
the
street
yesterday
,
and
found
a
man
at
a
corner
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
that
man
was
watching
me
,
and
was
looking
at
my
pockets
to
see
whether
the
jewel
case
was
there
.
<EOS>
As
for
myself
,
I
can
think
of
nothing
else
.
<EOS>
I
wish
I
had
got
them
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
something
then
to
pay
me
for
all
this
nuisance
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
wish
you
had
,
"
said
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
I
should
do
with
them
<EOS>
I
can
not
even
imagine
.
<EOS>
I
am
always
thinking
of
that
,
too
,
 
making
plans
for
getting
rid
of
them
,
supposing
I
had
stolen
them
.
<EOS>
My
belief
is
,
that
I
should
be
so
sick
of
them
that
I
should
chuck
them
over
the
bridge
into
the
river
,
 
only
that
I
should
fear
that
some
policeman
's
eye
would
be
on
me
as
I
did
it
.
<EOS>
My
present
position
is
not
comfortable
,
 
but
if
I
had
got
them
,
I
think
that
the
weight
of
them
would
crush
me
altogether
.
<EOS>
Having
a
handle
to
my
name
,
and
being
a
lord
,
or
,
at
least
,
called
a
lord
,
makes
it
all
the
worse
.
<EOS>
People
are
so
pleased
to
think
that
a
lord
should
have
stolen
a
necklace
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lizzie
listened
to
it
all
with
a
strange
fascination
.
<EOS>
If
this
strong
man
were
so
much
upset
by
the
bare
suspicion
,
what
must
be
her
condition
?
<EOS>
The
jewels
were
in
her
desk
up
-
stairs
,
and
the
police
had
been
with
her
also
,
 
were
even
now
probably
looking
after
her
and
watching
her
.
<EOS>
How
much
more
difficult
must
it
be
for
her
to
deal
with
the
diamonds
than
it
would
have
been
for
this
man
.
<EOS>
Presently
Mrs.
Carbuncle
left
the
room
,
and
Lucinda
followed
her
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
saw
them
go
,
and
did
not
dare
to
go
with
them
.
<EOS>
She
felt
as
though
her
limbs
would
not
have
carried
her
to
the
door
.
<EOS>
She
was
now
alone
with
her
Corsair
;
and
she
looked
up
timidly
into
his
deep
-
set
eyes
,
as
he
came
and
stood
over
her
.
"
<EOS>
Tell
me
all
that
you
know
about
it
,
"
he
said
,
in
that
deep
,
low
voice
which
,
from
her
first
acquaintance
with
him
,
had
filled
her
with
interest
,
and
almost
with
awe
.
   
<EOS>
Confidence
 
<EOS>
Lizzie
Eustace
was
speechless
as
she
continued
to
look
up
into
the
Corsair
's
face
.
<EOS>
She
ought
to
have
answered
him
briskly
,
either
with
indignation
or
with
a
touch
of
humour
.
<EOS>
But
she
could
not
answer
him
at
all
.
<EOS>
She
was
desired
to
tell
him
all
that
she
knew
about
the
robbery
,
and
she
was
unable
to
declare
that
she
knew
nothing
.
<EOS>
How
much
did
he
suspect
?
<EOS>
What
did
he
believe
?
<EOS>
Had
she
been
watched
by
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
and
had
something
of
the
truth
been
told
to
him
?
<EOS>
And
then
would
it
not
be
better
for
her
that
he
should
know
it
all
?
<EOS>
Unsupported
and
alone
<EOS>
she
could
not
bear
the
trouble
which
was
on
her
.
<EOS>
If
she
were
driven
to
tell
her
secret
to
any
one
,
had
she
not
better
tell
it
to
him
?
<EOS>
She
knew
that
if
she
did
so
,
she
would
be
a
creature
in
his
hands
to
be
dealt
with
as
he
pleased
;
 
but
would
there
not
be
a
certain
charm
in
being
so
mastered
?
<EOS>
He
was
but
a
pinchbeck
lord
.
<EOS>
She
had
wit
enough
to
know
that
;
but
then
she
had
wit
enough
also
to
feel
that
she
herself
was
but
a
pinchbeck
lady
.
<EOS>
He
would
be
fit
for
her
,
and
she
for
him
,
 
if
only
he
would
take
her
.
<EOS>
Since
her
daydreams
first
began
,
she
had
been
longing
for
a
Corsair
;
and
here
he
was
,
not
kneeling
at
her
feet
,
but
standing
over
her
,
 
as
became
a
Corsair
.
<EOS>
At
any
rate
he
had
mastered
her
now
,
and
she
could
not
speak
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
He
waited
perhaps
a
minute
,
looking
at
her
,
before
he
renewed
his
question
;
and
the
minute
seemed
to
her
to
be
an
age
.
<EOS>
During
every
second
her
power
beneath
his
gaze
sank
lower
and
lower
.
<EOS>
There
gradually
came
a
grim
smile
over
his
face
,
and
she
was
sure
that
he
could
read
her
very
heart
.
<EOS>
Then
he
called
her
by
her
Christian
name
,
 
as
he
had
never
called
her
before
.
<EOS>
"
Come
,
Lizzie
,
"
he
said
,
"
you
might
as
well
tell
me
all
about
it
.
<EOS>
You
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Know
what
?
<EOS>
"
The
words
were
audible
to
him
,
though
they
were
uttered
in
the
lowest
whisper
.
  
<EOS>
"
About
this
d
 
---
necklace
.
<EOS>
What
is
it
all
?
<EOS>
Where
are
they
?
<EOS>
And
how
did
you
manage
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
manage
anything
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
know
where
they
are
?
"
<EOS>
He
paused
again
,
still
gazing
at
her
.
<EOS>
Gradually
there
came
across
his
face
,
or
she
fancied
that
it
was
so
,
a
look
of
ferocity
which
thoroughly
frightened
her
.
<EOS>
If
he
should
turn
against
her
,
and
be
leagued
with
the
police
against
her
,
what
chance
would
she
have
?
<EOS>
"
You
know
where
they
are
,
"
he
said
,
repeating
his
words
.
<EOS>
Then
at
last
she
nodded
her
head
,
assenting
to
his
assertion
.
"
<EOS>
And
where
are
they
?
<EOS>
Come
;
 
out
with
it
!
<EOS>
If
you
wo
n't
tell
me
,
you
must
tell
some
one
else
.
<EOS>
There
has
been
a
deal
too
much
of
this
already
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
wo
n't
betray
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
if
you
deal
openly
with
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
;
indeed
I
will
.
<EOS>
And
it
was
all
an
accident
.
<EOS>
When
I
took
them
out
of
the
box
,
I
only
did
it
for
safety
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
did
take
them
out
of
the
box
then
?
<EOS>
"
Again
she
nodded
her
head
.
"
<EOS>
And
have
got
them
now
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
There
was
another
nod
.
"
<EOS>
And
where
are
they
?
<EOS>
Come
;
with
such
a
spirit
of
enterprise
as
yours
<EOS>
you
ought
to
be
able
to
speak
.
<EOS>
Has
Benjamin
got
them
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
no
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
he
knows
nothing
about
them
?
"
  
"
Nothing
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
I
have
wronged
in
my
thoughts
that
son
of
Abraham
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nobody
knows
anything
,
"
said
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
even
Jane
or
Lucinda
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Nothing
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
you
have
kept
your
secret
marvellously
.
<EOS>
And
where
are
they
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Up
-
stairs
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
In
your
bed
-
room
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
In
my
desk
in
the
little
sitting
-
room
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
Lord
be
good
to
us
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
Lord
George
.
<EOS>
"
All
the
police
in
London
,
from
the
chief
downwards
,
are
agog
about
this
necklace
.
<EOS>
Every
well
-
known
thief
in
the
town
is
envied
by
every
other
thief
because
he
is
thought
to
have
had
a
finger
in
the
pie
.
<EOS>
I
am
suspected
,
and
Mr.
Benjamin
is
suspected
;
Sir
Griffin
is
suspected
,
and
half
the
jewellers
in
London
and
Paris
are
supposed
to
have
the
stones
in
their
keeping
.
<EOS>
Every
man
and
woman
is
talking
about
it
,
and
people
are
quarrelling
about
it
till
they
almost
cut
each
other
's
throats
;
and
all
the
while
you
have
got
them
locked
up
in
your
desk
!
<EOS>
How
on
earth
did
you
get
the
box
broken
open
and
then
conveyed
out
of
your
room
at
Carlisle
?
"
  
<EOS>
Then
Lizzie
,
in
a
frightened
whisper
,
with
her
eyes
often
turned
on
the
floor
,
told
the
whole
story
.
<EOS>
"
If
I
'd
had
a
minute
to
think
of
it
,
"
she
said
,
"
I
would
have
confessed
the
truth
at
Carlisle
.
<EOS>
Why
should
I
want
to
steal
what
was
my
own
?
<EOS>
But
they
came
to
me
all
so
quickly
,
and
I
did
n't
like
to
say
that
I
had
them
under
my
pillow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
daresay
not
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
then
I
could
n't
tell
anybody
afterwards
.
<EOS>
I
always
meant
to
tell
you
,
 
from
the
very
first
;
because
I
knew
you
would
be
good
to
me
.
<EOS>
They
are
my
own
.
<EOS>
Surely
I
might
do
what
I
liked
with
my
own
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
 
yes
<EOS>
;
in
one
way
.
<EOS>
But
you
see
there
was
a
lawsuit
in
Chancery
going
on
about
them
;
and
then
you
committed
perjury
at
Carlisle
.
<EOS>
And
altogether
,
 
it
's
not
quite
straight
sailing
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
not
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
Hardly
.
<EOS>
Major
Mackintosh
,
and
the
magistrates
,
and
Messrs.
Bunfit
and
Gager
wo
n't
settle
down
,
peaceable
and
satisfied
,
when
they
hear
the
end
of
the
story
.
<EOS>
And
I
think
Messrs.
Camperdown
will
have
a
bill
against
you
.
<EOS>
It
's
been
uncommonly
clever
,
but
I
do
n't
see
the
use
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
've
been
very
foolish
,
"
said
Lizzie
,
 
"
<EOS>
but
you
wo
n't
desert
me
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
word
I
do
n't
know
what
I
'm
to
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
have
them
,
 
as
a
present
?
"
  
"
Certainly
not
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
're
worth
ever
so
much
;
 
ten
thousand
pounds
!
<EOS>
And
they
are
my
own
,
to
do
just
what
I
please
with
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
very
good
;
 
but
what
should
I
do
with
them
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sell
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Who
'd
buy
them
?
<EOS>
And
before
a
week
was
over
<EOS>
I
should
be
in
prison
,
and
in
a
couple
of
months
should
be
standing
at
the
Old
Bailey
at
my
trial
.
<EOS>
I
could
n't
just
do
that
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
will
you
do
for
me
?
<EOS>
You
are
my
friend
;
 
ai
n't
you
?
"
<EOS>
The
diamond
necklace
was
not
a
desirable
possession
in
the
eyes
of
Lord
George
de
Bruce
Carruthers
;
 
but
Portray
Castle
,
with
its
income
,
and
the
fact
that
Lizzie
Eustace
was
still
a
very
young
woman
,
was
desirable
.
<EOS>
Her
prettiness
too
was
not
altogether
thrown
away
on
Lord
George
,
 
though
,
as
he
was
wo
nt
to
say
to
himself
,
he
was
too
old
now
to
sacrifice
much
for
such
a
toy
as
that
.
<EOS>
Something
he
must
do
,
 
<EOS>
if
only
because
of
the
knowledge
which
had
come
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
go
away
and
leave
her
,
and
neither
say
nor
do
anything
in
the
matter
.
<EOS>
And
he
could
not
betray
her
to
the
police
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
not
desert
me
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
taking
hold
of
his
hand
,
and
kissing
it
as
a
suppliant
.
  
<EOS>
He
passed
his
arm
round
her
waist
,
but
more
as
though
she
were
a
child
than
a
woman
,
as
he
stood
thinking
.
<EOS>
Of
all
the
affairs
in
which
he
had
ever
been
engaged
,
it
was
the
most
difficult
.
<EOS>
She
submitted
to
his
embrace
,
and
leaned
upon
his
shoulder
,
and
looked
up
into
his
face
.
<EOS>
If
he
would
only
tell
her
that
he
loved
her
,
then
he
would
be
bound
to
her
,
 
then
must
he
share
with
her
the
burthen
of
the
diamonds
,
 
then
must
he
be
true
to
her
.
"
<EOS>
George
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
and
burst
into
a
low
suppressed
wailing
,
with
her
face
hidden
upon
his
arm
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
all
very
well
,
"
said
he
,
still
holding
her
,
 
for
she
was
pleasant
to
hold
,
 
"
but
what
the
d
 
---
is
a
fellow
to
do
?
<EOS>
I
do
n't
see
my
way
out
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
think
you
'd
better
go
to
Camperdown
,
and
give
them
up
to
him
,
and
tell
him
the
truth
.
<EOS>
"
Then
she
sobbed
more
violently
than
before
,
till
her
quick
ear
caught
the
sound
of
a
footstep
on
the
stairs
,
and
in
a
moment
she
was
out
of
his
arms
and
seated
on
the
sofa
,
with
hardly
a
trace
of
tears
in
her
eyes
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
footman
,
who
desired
to
know
whether
Lady
Eustace
would
want
the
carriage
that
afternoon
.
<EOS>
Lady
Eustace
,
with
her
cheeriest
voice
,
sent
her
love
to
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
and
her
assurance
that
she
would
not
want
the
carriage
before
the
evening
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
that
you
can
do
anything
else
,
"
continued
Lord
George
,
"
except
just
give
them
up
and
brazen
it
out
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
suppose
they
'd
prosecute
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Prosecute
me
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
"
For
perjury
,
I
mean
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
what
could
they
do
to
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
do
n't
know
.
<EOS>
Lock
you
up
for
five
years
,
perhaps
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Because
I
had
my
own
necklace
under
the
pillow
in
my
own
room
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Think
of
all
the
trouble
you
've
given
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
never
give
them
up
to
Mr.
Camperdown
.
<EOS>
They
are
mine
;
 
my
very
own
.
<EOS>
My
cousin
,
Mr.
Greystock
,
who
is
much
more
of
a
lawyer
than
Mr.
Camperdown
,
says
so
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
George
,
do
think
of
something
!
<EOS>
Do
n't
tell
me
that
I
must
give
them
up
!
<EOS>
Would
n't
Mr.
Benjamin
buy
them
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Yes
;
 
for
half
nothing
;
and
then
go
and
tell
the
whole
story
and
get
money
from
the
other
side
.
<EOS>
You
ca
n't
trust
Benjamin
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
can
trust
you
.
"
<EOS>
She
clung
to
him
and
implored
him
,
and
did
get
from
him
a
renewed
promise
that
he
would
not
reveal
her
secret
.
<EOS>
She
wanted
him
to
take
the
terrible
packet
from
her
there
and
then
,
and
use
his
own
judgment
in
disposing
of
it
.
<EOS>
But
this
he
positively
refused
to
do
.
<EOS>
He
protested
that
they
were
safer
with
her
than
they
could
be
with
him
.
<EOS>
He
explained
to
her
that
if
they
were
found
in
his
hands
,
his
offence
in
having
them
in
his
possession
would
be
much
greater
than
hers
.
<EOS>
They
were
her
own
,
 
as
she
was
ever
so
ready
to
assert
;
or
if
not
her
own
,
the
ownership
was
so
doubtful
that
she
could
not
be
accused
of
having
stolen
them
.
<EOS>
And
then
he
needed
to
consider
it
all
,
 
to
sleep
upon
it
,
 
before
he
could
make
up
his
mind
what
he
would
do
.
  
<EOS>
But
there
was
one
other
trouble
on
her
mind
as
to
which
he
was
called
upon
to
give
her
counsel
before
he
was
allowed
to
leave
her
.
<EOS>
She
had
told
the
detective
officer
that
she
would
submit
her
boxes
and
desks
to
be
searched
if
her
cousin
Frank
should
advise
it
.
<EOS>
If
the
policeman
were
to
return
with
her
cousin
while
the
diamonds
were
still
in
her
desk
,
what
should
she
do
?
<EOS>
He
might
come
at
any
time
;
and
then
she
would
be
bound
to
obey
him
.
"
<EOS>
And
he
thinks
that
they
were
stolen
at
Carlisle
?
"
asked
Lord
George
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Of
course
he
thinks
so
,
"
said
Lizzie
,
almost
indignantly
.
<EOS>
"
They
would
never
ask
to
search
your
person
,
"
suggested
Lord
George
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
could
not
say
.
<EOS>
She
had
simply
declared
that
she
would
be
guided
by
her
cousin
.
"
<EOS>
Have
them
about
you
when
he
comes
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
take
them
out
with
you
;
but
keep
them
in
your
pocket
while
you
are
in
the
house
during
the
day
.
<EOS>
They
will
hardly
bring
a
woman
with
them
to
search
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
there
was
a
woman
with
the
man
when
he
came
before
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
you
must
refuse
in
spite
of
your
cousin
.
<EOS>
Show
yourself
angry
with
him
and
with
everybody
.
<EOS>
Swear
that
you
did
not
intend
to
submit
yourself
to
such
indignity
as
that
.
<EOS>
They
ca
n't
do
it
without
a
magistrate
's
order
,
unless
you
permit
it
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
suppose
they
will
come
at
all
;
and
if
they
do
they
will
only
look
at
your
clothes
and
your
boxes
.
<EOS>
If
they
ask
to
do
more
,
be
stout
with
them
and
refuse
.
<EOS>
Of
course
they
'll
suspect
you
,
but
they
do
that
already
.
<EOS>
And
your
cousin
will
suspect
you
;
 
but
you
must
put
up
with
that
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
very
bad
;
 
but
I
see
nothing
better
.
<EOS>
But
,
of
all
things
,
say
nothing
of
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
no
,
"
said
Lizzie
,
promising
to
be
obedient
to
him
.
<EOS>
And
then
he
took
his
leave
of
her
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
be
true
to
me
;
 
will
you
not
?
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
still
clinging
to
his
arm
.
<EOS>
He
promised
her
that
he
would
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
George
<EOS>
,
"
she
said
,
"
I
have
no
friend
now
but
you
.
<EOS>
You
will
care
for
me
?
"
<EOS>
He
took
her
in
his
arms
and
kissed
her
,
and
promised
her
that
he
would
care
for
her
.
<EOS>
How
was
he
to
save
himself
from
doing
so
?
<EOS>
When
he
was
gone
,
Lizzie
sat
down
to
think
of
it
all
,
and
felt
sure
that
at
last
she
had
found
her
Corsair
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
Goes
to
the
Theatre
 
Mrs.
Carbuncle
and
Lizzie
Eustace
did
not
,
in
these
days
,
shut
themselves
up
because
there
was
trouble
in
the
household
.
<EOS>
It
would
not
have
suited
the
creed
of
Mrs.
Carbuncle
on
social
matters
to
be
shut
up
from
the
amusements
of
life
.
<EOS>
She
had
sacrificed
too
much
in
seeking
them
for
that
,
and
was
too
conscious
of
the
price
she
paid
for
them
.
<EOS>
It
was
still
mid
-
winter
,
but
nevertheless
there
was
generally
some
amusement
arranged
for
every
evening
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
was
very
fond
of
the
play
,
and
made
herself
acquainted
with
every
new
piece
as
it
came
out
.
<EOS>
Every
actor
and
actress
of
note
on
the
stage
was
known
to
her
,
and
she
dealt
freely
in
criticisms
on
their
respective
merits
.
<EOS>
The
three
ladies
had
a
box
at
the
Haymarket
taken
for
this
very
evening
,
at
which
a
new
piece
,
"
The
Noble
Jilt
,
"
from
the
hand
of
a
very
eminent
author
,
was
to
be
produced
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
had
talked
a
great
deal
about
"
The
Noble
Jilt
,
"
and
could
boast
that
she
had
discussed
the
merits
of
the
two
chief
characters
with
the
actor
and
actress
who
were
to
undertake
them
.
<EOS>
Miss
Talbot
had
assured
her
that
the
Margaret
was
altogether
impracticable
,
and
Mrs.
Carbuncle
was
quite
of
the
same
opinion
.
<EOS>
And
as
for
the
hero
,
Steinmark
,
 
it
was
a
part
that
no
man
could
play
so
as
to
obtain
the
sympathy
of
an
audience
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
second
hero
,
 
a
Flemish
Count
,
 
tame
as
rain
-
water
,
Mrs.
Carbuncle
said
.
<EOS>
She
was
very
anxious
for
the
success
of
the
piece
,
which
,
as
she
said
,
had
its
merits
;
but
she
was
sure
that
it
would
n't
do
.
<EOS>
She
had
talked
about
it
a
great
deal
,
and
now
,
when
the
evening
came
,
she
was
not
going
to
be
deterred
from
seeing
it
by
any
trouble
in
reference
to
a
diamond
necklace
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
,
when
she
was
left
by
Lord
George
,
had
many
doubts
on
the
subject
,
 
whether
she
would
go
or
stay
at
home
.
<EOS>
If
he
would
have
come
to
her
,
or
her
cousin
Frank
,
or
if
,
had
it
been
possible
,
Lord
Fawn
would
have
come
,
she
would
have
given
up
the
play
very
willingly
.
<EOS>
But
to
be
alone
,
 
with
her
necklace
in
the
desk
up
-
stairs
,
or
in
her
pocket
,
was
terrible
to
her
.
<EOS>
And
then
,
they
could
not
search
her
or
her
boxes
while
she
was
at
the
theatre
.
<EOS>
She
must
not
take
the
necklace
with
her
there
.
<EOS>
He
had
told
her
to
leave
it
in
her
desk
,
when
she
went
from
home
.
  
<EOS>
Lucinda
,
also
,
was
quite
determined
that
she
would
see
the
new
piece
.
<EOS>
She
declared
to
her
aunt
,
in
Lizzie
's
presence
,
without
a
vestige
of
a
smile
,
that
it
might
be
well
to
see
how
a
jilt
could
behave
herself
,
so
as
to
do
her
work
of
jilting
in
any
noble
fashion
.
"
<EOS>
My
dear
,
"
said
her
aunt
,
"
you
let
things
weigh
upon
your
heart
a
great
deal
too
much
.
"
<EOS>
"
Not
upon
my
heart
,
Aunt
Jane
,
"
the
young
lady
had
answered
.
<EOS>
She
also
intended
to
go
,
and
when
she
had
made
up
her
mind
to
anything
,
nothing
would
deter
her
.
<EOS>
She
had
no
desire
to
stay
at
home
in
order
that
she
might
see
Sir
Griffin
.
<EOS>
"
I
daresay
the
play
may
be
very
bad
,
"
she
said
,
"
but
it
can
hardly
be
so
bad
as
real
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Lizzie
,
when
Lord
George
had
left
her
,
crept
up
-
stairs
,
and
sat
for
awhile
thinking
of
her
condition
,
with
the
key
of
her
desk
in
her
hand
.
<EOS>
Should
there
come
a
knock
at
the
door
<EOS>
,
the
case
of
diamonds
would
be
in
her
pocket
in
a
moment
.
<EOS>
Her
own
room
door
was
bolted
on
the
inside
,
so
that
she
might
have
an
instant
for
her
preparation
.
<EOS>
She
was
quite
resolved
that
she
would
carry
out
Lord
George
's
recommendation
,
and
that
no
policeman
or
woman
should
examine
her
person
,
unless
it
were
done
by
violence
.
<EOS>
There
she
sat
,
almost
expecting
that
at
every
moment
her
cousin
would
be
there
with
Bunfit
and
the
woman
.
<EOS>
But
nobody
came
,
and
at
six
she
went
down
to
dinner
.
<EOS>
After
much
consideration
she
then
left
the
diamonds
in
the
desk
.
<EOS>
Surely
no
one
would
come
to
search
at
such
an
hour
as
that
.
<EOS>
No
one
had
come
when
the
carriage
was
announced
,
and
the
three
ladies
went
off
together
.
  
<EOS>
During
the
whole
way
Mrs.
Carbuncle
talked
of
the
terrible
situation
in
which
poor
Lord
George
was
placed
by
the
robbery
,
and
of
all
that
Lizzie
owed
him
on
account
of
his
trouble
.
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
"
said
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
"
the
least
you
can
do
for
him
is
to
give
him
all
that
you
've
got
to
give
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
that
he
wants
me
to
give
him
anything
,
"
said
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
that
's
quite
plain
,
"
said
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
"
and
<EOS>
I
'm
sure
I
wish
it
may
be
so
.
<EOS>
He
and
I
have
been
dear
friends
,
 
very
dear
friends
,
and
there
is
nothing
I
wish
so
much
as
to
see
him
properly
settled
.
<EOS>
Ill
-
natured
people
like
to
say
all
manner
of
things
because
everybody
does
not
choose
to
live
in
their
own
heartless
,
conventional
form
.
<EOS>
But
I
can
assure
you
there
is
nothing
between
me
and
Lord
George
which
need
prevent
him
from
giving
his
whole
heart
to
you
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
suppose
there
is
,
"
said
Lizzie
,
who
loved
an
opportunity
of
giving
Mrs.
Carbuncle
a
little
rap
.
  
<EOS>
The
play
,
as
a
play
,
was
a
failure
;
at
least
so
said
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
<EOS>
The
critics
,
on
the
next
morning
,
were
somewhat
divided
,
 
not
only
in
judgment
,
but
as
to
facts
.
<EOS>
To
say
how
a
play
has
been
received
is
of
more
moment
than
to
speak
of
its
own
merits
or
of
the
merits
of
the
actors
.
<EOS>
Three
or
four
of
the
papers
declared
that
the
audience
was
not
only
eulogistic
,
but
enthusiastic
.
<EOS>
One
or
two
others
averred
that
the
piece
fell
very
flatly
.
<EOS>
As
it
was
not
acted
above
four
or
five
dozen
times
consecutively
,
it
must
be
regarded
as
a
failure
.
<EOS>
On
their
way
home
Mrs.
Carbuncle
declared
that
Minnie
Talbot
had
done
her
very
best
with
such
a
part
as
Margaret
,
but
that
the
character
afforded
no
scope
for
sympathy
.
"
<EOS>
A
noble
jilt
,
my
dears
,
"
said
Mrs.
Carbuncle
eloquently
,
"
is
a
contradiction
in
terms
.
<EOS>
There
can
be
no
such
thing
.
<EOS>
A
woman
,
when
she
has
once
said
the
word
,
is
bound
to
stick
to
it
.
<EOS>
The
delicacy
of
the
female
character
should
not
admit
of
hesitation
between
two
men
.
<EOS>
The
idea
is
quite
revolting
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
may
not
one
have
an
idea
of
no
man
at
all
?
"
 
<EOS>
asked
Lucinda
.
<EOS>
"
Must
that
be
revolting
also
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
a
young
woman
may
entertain
such
an
idea
;
though
for
my
part
I
look
upon
it
as
unnatural
.
<EOS>
But
when
she
has
once
given
herself
there
can
be
no
taking
back
without
the
loss
of
that
aroma
which
should
be
the
apple
of
a
young
woman
's
eye
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
she
finds
that
she
has
made
a
mistake
 
?
"
said
Lucinda
fiercely
.
<EOS>
"
Why
should
n't
a
young
woman
make
a
mistake
as
well
as
an
old
woman
?
<EOS>
Her
aroma
wo
n't
prevent
her
from
having
been
wrong
and
finding
it
out
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
such
mistakes
,
as
you
call
them
,
always
arise
from
fantastic
notions
.
<EOS>
Look
at
this
piece
.
<EOS>
Why
does
the
lady
jilt
her
lover
?
<EOS>
Not
because
she
does
n't
like
him
.
<EOS>
She
's
just
as
fond
of
him
as
ever
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
's
a
stupid
sort
of
a
fellow
,
and
I
think
she
was
quite
right
,
"
said
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
"
I
'd
never
marry
a
man
merely
because
I
said
I
would
.
<EOS>
If
I
found
I
did
n't
like
him
,
I
'd
leave
him
at
the
altar
.
<EOS>
If
I
found
I
did
n't
like
him
,
I
'd
leave
him
even
after
the
altar
.
<EOS>
I
'd
leave
him
any
time
I
found
I
did
n't
like
him
.
<EOS>
It
's
all
very
well
to
talk
of
aroma
,
but
to
live
with
a
man
you
do
n't
like
 
is
the
devil
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
those
whom
God
has
joined
together
should
n't
be
separated
,
 
for
any
mere
likings
or
dislikings
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
This
Mrs.
Carbuncle
said
in
a
high
tone
of
moral
feeling
,
just
as
the
carriage
stopped
at
the
door
in
Hertford
Street
.
<EOS>
They
at
once
perceived
that
the
hall
-
door
was
open
,
and
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
as
she
crossed
the
pavement
,
saw
that
there
were
two
policemen
in
the
hall
.
<EOS>
The
footman
had
been
with
them
to
the
theatre
,
but
the
cook
and
housemaid
,
and
Mrs.
Carbuncle
's
own
maid
,
were
with
the
policemen
in
the
passage
.
<EOS>
She
gave
a
little
scream
,
and
then
Lizzie
,
who
had
followed
her
,
seized
her
by
the
arm
.
<EOS>
She
turned
round
and
saw
by
the
gas
-
light
that
Lizzie
's
face
was
white
as
a
sheet
,
and
that
all
the
lines
of
her
countenance
were
rigid
and
almost
distorted
.
"
<EOS>
Then
she
does
know
all
about
it
!
"
said
Mrs.
Carbuncle
to
herself
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
did
n't
speak
,
but
still
hung
on
to
Mrs.
Carbuncle
's
arm
,
and
Lucinda
,
having
seen
how
it
was
,
was
also
supporting
her
.
<EOS>
A
policeman
stepped
forward
and
touched
his
hat
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
Bunfit
;
 
neither
was
he
Gager
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
though
the
ladies
had
not
perceived
the
difference
,
he
was
not
at
all
like
Bunfit
or
Gager
.
<EOS>
This
man
was
dressed
in
a
policeman
's
uniform
,
whereas
Bunfit
and
Gager
always
wore
plain
clothes
.
<EOS>
"
My
lady
,
"
said
the
policeman
,
addressing
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
"
there
's
been
a
robbery
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
robbery
!
<EOS>
"
ejaculated
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
my
lady
.
<EOS>
The
servants
all
out
,
 
all
to
one
;
and
she
's
off
.
<EOS>
They
've
taken
jewels
,
and
,
no
doubt
,
money
,
if
there
was
any
.
<EOS>
They
do
n't
mostly
come
unless
they
know
what
they
comes
for
.
"
  
<EOS>
With
a
horrid
spasm
across
her
heart
,
which
seemed
ready
to
kill
her
,
so
sharp
was
the
pain
,
Lizzie
recovered
the
use
of
her
legs
and
followed
Mrs.
Carbuncle
into
the
dining
-
room
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
hardly
conscious
of
hearing
;
but
she
had
heard
,
and
it
had
seemed
to
her
that
the
robbery
spoken
of
was
something
distinct
from
her
own
affair
.
<EOS>
The
policemen
did
not
speak
of
having
found
the
diamonds
.
<EOS>
It
was
of
something
lost
that
they
spoke
.
<EOS>
She
seated
herself
in
a
chair
against
the
wall
,
but
did
not
utter
a
word
.
<EOS>
"
We
've
been
up
-
stairs
,
my
lady
,
and
they
've
been
in
most
of
the
rooms
.
<EOS>
There
's
a
desk
broke
open
,
"
 
Lizzie
gave
an
involuntary
little
scream
;
 
"
Yes
,
mum
,
a
desk
,
"
continued
the
policeman
turning
to
Lizzie
,
"
and
a
bureau
,
and
a
dressing
-
case
.
<EOS>
What
's
gone
your
ladyship
can
tell
when
you
sees
.
<EOS>
And
one
of
the
young
women
is
off
.
<EOS>
It
's
she
as
done
it
.
"
<EOS>
Then
the
cook
explained
.
<EOS>
She
and
the
housemaid
,
and
Mrs.
Carbuncle
's
lady
's
maid
,
had
just
stepped
out
,
only
round
the
corner
,
to
get
a
little
air
,
leaving
Patience
Crabstick
in
charge
of
the
house
;
and
when
they
came
back
,
the
area
gate
was
locked
against
them
,
the
front
door
was
locked
,
and
finding
themselves
unable
to
get
in
after
many
knockings
,
they
had
at
last
obtained
the
assistance
of
a
policeman
.
<EOS>
He
had
got
into
the
place
over
the
area
gate
,
had
opened
the
front
door
from
within
,
and
then
the
robbery
had
been
discovered
.
<EOS>
It
was
afterwards
found
that
the
servants
had
all
gone
out
to
what
they
called
a
tea
-
party
,
at
a
public
-
house
in
the
neighbourhood
,
and
that
by
previous
agreement
Patience
Crabstick
had
remained
in
charge
.
<EOS>
When
they
came
back
<EOS>
Patience
Crabstick
was
gone
,
and
the
desk
,
and
bureau
,
and
dressing
-
case
,
were
found
to
have
been
opened
.
<EOS>
"
She
had
a
reg'lar
thief
along
with
her
,
my
lady
,
"
said
the
policeman
,
still
addressing
himself
to
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
 
"
'cause
of
the
way
the
things
was
opened
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
always
knew
that
young
woman
was
downright
bad
,
"
said
Mrs.
Carbuncle
in
her
first
expression
of
wrath
.
  
<EOS>
But
Lizzie
sat
in
her
chair
without
saying
a
word
,
still
pale
,
with
that
almost
awful
look
of
agony
in
her
face
.
<EOS>
Within
ten
minutes
of
their
entering
the
house
,
Mrs.
Carbuncle
was
making
her
way
up
-
stairs
,
with
the
two
policemen
following
her
.
<EOS>
That
her
bureau
and
her
dressing
-
case
should
have
been
opened
was
dreadful
to
her
,
though
the
value
that
she
could
thus
lose
was
very
small
.
<EOS>
She
also
possessed
diamonds
,
 
but
her
diamonds
were
paste
;
and
whatever
jewellery
she
had
of
any
value
,
 
<EOS>
a
few
rings
,
and
a
brooch
,
and
such
like
,
 
had
been
on
her
person
in
the
theatre
.
<EOS>
What
little
money
she
had
by
her
was
in
the
drawing
-
room
,
and
<EOS>
the
drawing
-
room
,
as
it
seemed
,
had
not
been
entered
.
<EOS>
In
truth
,
all
Mrs.
Carbuncle
's
possessions
in
the
house
were
not
sufficient
to
have
tempted
a
well
-
bred
,
well
-
instructed
thief
.
<EOS>
But
it
behoved
her
to
be
indignant
;
and
she
could
be
indignant
with
grace
,
as
the
thief
was
discovered
to
be
,
not
her
maid
,
but
Patience
Crabstick
.
<EOS>
The
policemen
followed
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
and
the
maids
followed
the
policemen
;
but
Lizzie
Eustace
kept
her
seat
in
the
chair
by
the
wall
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Do
you
think
they
have
taken
much
of
yours
?
"
said
Lucinda
,
coming
up
to
her
and
speaking
very
gently
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
made
a
motion
with
her
two
hands
upon
her
heart
,
and
struggled
,
and
gasped
,
 
as
though
she
wished
to
speak
but
could
not
.
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
it
is
that
girl
who
has
done
it
all
,
"
said
Lucinda
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
nodded
her
head
,
and
tried
to
smile
.
<EOS>
The
attempt
was
so
ghastly
that
Lucinda
,
though
not
timid
by
nature
,
was
frightened
.
<EOS>
She
sat
down
and
took
Lizzie
's
hand
,
and
tried
to
comfort
her
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
very
hard
upon
you
,
"
she
said
,
"
to
be
twice
robbed
.
"
<EOS>
Lizzie
again
nodded
her
head
.
<EOS>
"
I
hope
it
is
not
much
now
.
<EOS>
Shall
we
go
up
and
see
?
<EOS>
"
The
poor
creature
did
get
upon
her
legs
,
but
she
gasped
so
terribly
that
Lucinda
feared
that
she
was
dying
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Shall
I
send
for
some
one
?
"
<EOS>
she
said
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
made
an
effort
to
speak
,
was
shaken
convulsively
while
the
other
supported
her
,
and
then
burst
into
a
flood
of
tears
.
  
<EOS>
When
that
had
come
she
was
relieved
,
and
could
again
act
her
part
.
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
she
said
,
"
we
will
go
with
them
.
<EOS>
It
is
so
dreadful
;
 
is
it
not
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Very
dreadful
;
 
but
how
much
better
that
we
were
n't
at
home
!
<EOS>
Shall
we
go
now
?
<EOS>
"
Then
together
they
followed
the
others
,
and
on
the
stairs
Lizzie
explained
that
in
her
desk
,
of
which
she
always
carried
the
key
round
<EOS>
her
neck
<EOS>
,
there
was
what
money
she
had
by
her
;
 
two
ten
-
pound
notes
,
and
four
five
-
pound
notes
,
and
three
sovereigns
;
 
in
all
,
forty
-
three
pounds
.
<EOS>
Her
other
jewels
,
 
the
jewels
which
she
had
possessed
over
and
above
the
fatal
diamond
necklace
,
 
were
in
her
dressing
-
case
.
<EOS>
Patience
,
she
did
not
doubt
,
had
known
that
the
money
was
there
,
and
certainly
knew
of
her
jewels
.
<EOS>
So
they
went
up
-
stairs
.
<EOS>
The
desk
was
open
and
the
money
gone
.
<EOS>
Five
or
six
rings
and
a
bracelet
had
been
taken
also
from
Lizzie
's
dressing
-
case
,
which
she
had
left
open
.
<EOS>
Of
Mrs.
Carbuncle
's
property
sufficient
had
been
stolen
to
make
a
long
list
in
that
lady
's
handwriting
.
<EOS>
Lucinda
Roanoke
's
room
had
not
been
entered
,
 
as
far
as
they
could
judge
.
<EOS>
The
girl
had
taken
the
best
of
her
own
clothes
,
and
a
pair
of
strong
boots
belonging
to
the
cook
.
<EOS>
A
superintendent
of
police
was
there
before
they
went
to
bed
,
and
a
list
was
made
out
.
<EOS>
The
superintendent
was
of
opinion
that
the
thing
had
been
done
very
cleverly
,
but
was
of
opinion
that
the
thieves
had
expected
to
find
more
plunder
.
<EOS>
"
They
do
n't
care
so
much
about
banknotes
,
my
lady
,
because
they
fetches
such
a
low
price
with
them
as
they
deal
with
.
<EOS>
The
three
sovereigns
is
more
to
them
than
all
the
forty
pounds
in
notes
.
<EOS>
"
The
superintendent
had
heard
of
the
diamond
necklace
,
and
expressed
an
opinion
that
poor
Lady
Eustace
was
especially
marked
out
for
misfortune
.
<EOS>
"
It
all
comes
of
having
such
a
girl
as
that
about
her
,
"
said
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
<EOS>
The
superintendent
,
who
intended
to
be
consolatory
to
Lizzie
,
expressed
his
opinion
that
it
was
very
hard
to
know
what
a
young
woman
was
.
<EOS>
"
They
looks
as
soft
as
butter
,
and
they
're
as
sly
as
foxes
,
and
as
quick
,
as
quick
 
as
quick
as
greased
lightning
,
my
lady
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Such
a
piece
of
business
as
this
which
had
just
occurred
,
will
make
people
intimate
at
a
very
short
notice
.
  
<EOS>
And
so
the
diamond
necklace
,
known
to
be
worth
ten
thousand
pounds
,
had
at
last
been
stolen
in
earnest
!
<EOS>
Lizzie
,
when
the
policemen
were
gone
,
and
the
noise
was
over
,
and
the
house
was
closed
,
slunk
away
to
her
bedroom
,
refusing
any
aid
in
lieu
of
that
of
the
wicked
Patience
.
<EOS>
She
herself
had
examined
the
desk
beneath
the
eyes
of
her
two
friends
and
of
the
policemen
,
and
had
seen
at
once
that
the
case
was
gone
.
<EOS>
The
money
was
gone
too
,
as
she
was
rejoiced
to
find
.
<EOS>
She
perceived
at
once
that
had
the
money
been
left
,
 
the
very
leaving
of
it
would
have
gone
to
prove
that
other
prize
had
been
there
.
<EOS>
But
the
money
was
gone
,
 
money
of
which
she
had
given
a
correct
account
;
 
and
she
could
now
honestly
allege
that
she
had
been
robbed
.
<EOS>
But
she
had
at
last
really
lost
her
great
treasure
;
 
and
if
the
treasure
should
be
found
,
then
would
she
infallibly
be
exposed
.
<EOS>
She
had
talked
twice
of
giving
away
her
necklace
,
and
had
seriously
thought
of
getting
rid
of
it
by
burying
it
deep
in
the
sea
.
<EOS>
But
now
that
it
was
in
very
truth
gone
from
her
,
the
loss
of
it
was
horrible
to
her
.
<EOS>
Ten
thousand
pounds
,
for
which
she
had
struggled
so
much
and
borne
so
many
things
,
which
had
come
to
be
the
prevailing
fact
of
her
life
,
gone
from
her
for
ever
!
<EOS>
Nevertheless
it
was
not
that
sorrow
,
that
regret
,
which
had
so
nearly
overpowered
her
in
the
dining
-
parlour
.
<EOS>
At
that
moment
she
hardly
knew
,
had
hardly
thought
,
whether
the
diamonds
had
or
had
not
been
taken
.
<EOS>
But
the
feeling
came
upon
her
at
once
that
her
own
disgrace
was
every
hour
being
brought
nearer
to
her
.
<EOS>
Her
secret
was
no
longer
quite
her
own
.
<EOS>
One
man
knew
it
,
and
he
had
talked
to
her
of
perjury
and
of
five
years
"
imprisonment
.
<EOS>
Patience
must
have
known
it
,
too
;
and
now
some
one
else
also
knew
it
.
<EOS>
The
police
,
of
course
,
would
find
it
out
,
and
then
horrid
words
would
be
used
against
her
.
<EOS>
She
hardly
knew
what
perjury
was
.
<EOS>
It
sounded
like
forgery
and
burglary
.
<EOS>
To
stand
up
before
a
judge
and
be
tried
,
 
and
then
to
be
locked
up
for
five
years
in
prison
 
!
<EOS>
What
an
end
would
this
be
to
all
her
glorious
success
?
<EOS>
And
what
evil
had
she
done
to
merit
all
this
terrible
punishment
?
<EOS>
When
they
came
to
her
in
her
bedroom
at
Carlisle
she
had
simply
been
too
much
frightened
to
tell
them
all
that
the
necklace
was
at
that
moment
under
her
pillow
.
  
<EOS>
She
tried
to
think
of
it
all
,
and
to
form
some
idea
in
her
mind
of
what
might
be
the
truth
.
<EOS>
Of
course
,
Patience
Crabstick
had
known
her
secret
,
but
how
long
had
the
girl
known
it
?
<EOS>
And
how
had
the
girl
discovered
it
?
<EOS>
She
was
almost
certain
,
from
certain
circumstances
,
from
words
which
the
girl
had
spoken
,
and
from
signs
which
she
had
observed
,
that
Patience
had
not
even
suspected
that
the
necklace
had
been
brought
with
them
from
Carlisle
to
London
.
<EOS>
Of
course
,
the
coming
of
Bunfit
and
the
woman
would
have
set
the
girl
's
mind
to
work
in
that
direction
;
but
then
Bunfit
and
the
woman
had
only
been
there
on
that
morning
.
<EOS>
The
Corsair
knew
the
facts
,
and
no
one
but
the
Corsair
.
<EOS>
That
the
Corsair
was
a
Corsair
,
the
suspicions
of
the
police
had
proved
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
had
offered
the
necklace
to
the
Corsair
;
but
when
so
offered
,
he
had
refused
to
take
it
.
<EOS>
She
could
understand
that
he
should
see
the
danger
of
accepting
the
diamonds
from
her
hand
,
and
yet
should
be
desirous
of
having
them
.
<EOS>
And
might
not
he
have
thought
that
he
could
best
relieve
her
from
the
burthen
of
their
custody
in
this
manner
?
<EOS>
She
felt
no
anger
against
the
Corsair
as
she
weighed
the
probability
of
his
having
taken
them
in
this
fashion
.
<EOS>
A
Corsair
must
be
a
Corsair
.
<EOS>
Were
he
to
come
to
her
and
confess
the
deed
,
she
would
almost
like
him
<EOS>
the
better
for
it
,
 
<EOS>
admiring
his
skill
and
enterprise
.
<EOS>
But
how
very
clever
he
must
have
been
,
and
how
brave
!
<EOS>
He
had
known
,
no
doubt
,
that
the
three
ladies
were
all
going
to
the
theatre
;
but
in
how
short
a
time
had
he
got
rid
of
the
other
women
and
availed
himself
of
the
services
of
Patience
Crabstick
!
  
<EOS>
But
in
what
way
would
she
conduct
herself
when
the
police
should
come
to
her
on
the
following
morning
,
 
the
police
and
all
the
other
people
who
would
crowd
to
the
house
?
<EOS>
How
should
she
receive
her
cousin
Frank
?
<EOS>
How
should
she
look
when
the
coincidence
of
the
double
robbery
should
be
spoken
of
in
her
hearing
?
<EOS>
How
should
she
bear
herself
when
,
as
of
course
would
be
the
case
,
she
should
again
be
taken
before
the
magistrates
,
and
made
to
swear
as
to
the
loss
of
her
property
?
<EOS>
Must
she
commit
more
perjury
,
with
the
certainty
that
various
people
must
know
that
her
oath
was
false
?
<EOS>
All
the
world
would
suspect
her
.
<EOS>
All
the
world
would
soon
know
the
truth
.
<EOS>
Might
it
not
be
possible
that
the
diamonds
were
at
this
moment
in
the
hands
of
Messrs.
Camperdown
,
and
that
they
would
be
produced
before
her
eyes
,
as
soon
as
her
second
false
oath
had
been
registered
against
her
?
<EOS>
And
yet
how
could
she
tell
the
truth
?
<EOS>
And
what
would
the
Corsair
think
of
her
,
 
<EOS>
the
Corsair
,
who
would
know
everything
?
<EOS>
She
made
one
resolution
during
the
night
.
<EOS>
She
would
not
be
taken
into
court
.
<EOS>
The
magistrates
and
the
people
might
come
to
her
,
but
she
would
not
go
before
them
.
<EOS>
When
the
morning
came
she
said
that
she
was
ill
,
and
refused
to
leave
her
bed
.
<EOS>
Policemen
,
she
knew
,
were
in
the
house
early
.
<EOS>
At
about
nine
Mrs.
Carbuncle
and
Lucinda
were
up
and
in
her
room
.
<EOS>
The
excitement
of
the
affair
had
taken
them
from
their
beds
,
 
but
she
would
not
stir
.
<EOS>
If
it
were
absolutely
necessary
,
she
said
,
the
men
must
come
into
her
room
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
so
overset
by
what
had
occurred
on
the
previous
night
,
that
she
could
not
leave
her
room
.
<EOS>
She
appealed
to
Lucinda
as
to
the
fact
of
her
illness
.
<EOS>
The
trouble
of
these
robberies
was
so
great
upon
her
that
her
heart
was
almost
broken
.
<EOS>
If
her
deposition
must
be
taken
,
she
would
make
it
in
bed
.
<EOS>
In
the
course
of
the
day
the
magistrate
did
come
into
her
room
and
the
deposition
was
taken
.
<EOS>
Forty
-
three
pounds
had
been
taken
from
her
desk
,
and
certain
jewels
,
which
she
described
,
from
her
dressing
-
case
.
<EOS>
As
far
as
she
was
aware
,
no
other
property
of
hers
was
missing
.
<EOS>
This
<EOS>
she
said
in
answer
to
a
direct
question
from
the
magistrate
,
which
,
as
she
thought
,
was
asked
with
a
stern
voice
and
searching
eye
.
<EOS>
And
so
,
a
second
time
,
she
had
sworn
falsely
.
<EOS>
But
this
at
least
was
gained
,
 
that
Lord
George
de
Bruce
Carruthers
was
not
looking
at
her
as
she
swore
.
  
<EOS>
Lord
George
was
in
the
house
for
a
great
part
of
the
day
,
but
he
did
not
ask
to
be
admitted
to
Lizzie
's
room
;
 
nor
did
she
ask
to
see
him
.
<EOS>
Frank
Greystock
was
there
late
in
the
afternoon
,
and
went
up
at
once
to
his
cousin
.
<EOS>
The
moment
that
she
saw
him
she
stretched
out
her
arms
to
him
,
and
burst
into
tears
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
poor
girl
,
"
said
he
,
"
what
is
the
meaning
of
it
all
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
.
<EOS>
I
think
they
will
kill
me
.
<EOS>
They
want
to
kill
me
.
<EOS>
How
can
I
bear
it
all
?
<EOS>
The
robbers
were
here
last
night
,
and
magistrates
and
policemen
and
people
have
been
here
all
day
.
<EOS>
"
Then
she
fell
into
a
fit
of
sobbing
and
wailing
,
which
was
,
in
truth
,
hysterical
.
<EOS>
For
,
 
if
the
readers
think
of
it
,
 
the
poor
woman
had
a
great
deal
to
bear
.
  
<EOS>
Frank
,
into
whose
mind
no
glimmer
of
suspicion
against
his
cousin
had
yet
entered
,
and
who
firmly
believed
that
she
had
been
made
a
victim
because
of
the
value
of
her
diamonds
,
 
and
who
had
a
theory
of
his
own
about
the
robbery
at
Carlisle
,
to
the
circumstances
of
which
he
was
now
at
some
pains
to
make
these
latter
circumstances
adhere
,
 
was
very
tender
with
his
cousin
,
and
remained
in
the
house
for
more
than
an
hour
.
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Frank
,
what
had
I
better
do
?
<EOS>
"
she
asked
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
leave
London
,
if
I
were
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
 
of
course
.
<EOS>
I
will
.
<EOS>
Oh
yes
,
I
will
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
do
n't
fear
the
cold
of
Scotland
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
fear
nothing
,
 
nothing
but
being
where
these
policemen
can
come
to
me
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
"
 
<EOS>
and
then
she
shuddered
and
was
again
hysterical
.
<EOS>
Nor
was
she
acting
the
condition
.
<EOS>
As
she
remembered
the
magistrates
,
and
the
detectives
,
and
the
policemen
in
their
uniforms
,
 
and
reflected
that
she
might
probably
see
much
more
of
them
before
the
game
was
played
out
,
the
thoughts
that
crowded
on
her
were
almost
more
than
she
could
bear
.
  
<EOS>
"
Your
child
is
there
,
and
it
is
your
own
house
.
<EOS>
Go
there
till
all
this
passes
by
.
"
<EOS>
Whereupon
she
promised
him
that
,
as
soon
as
she
was
well
enough
,
she
would
at
once
go
to
Scotland
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
,
the
Eustace
diamonds
were
locked
up
in
a
small
safe
fixed
into
the
wall
at
the
back
of
a
small
cellar
beneath
the
establishment
of
Messrs.
Harter
and
Benjamin
,
in
Minto
Lane
,
in
the
City
.
<EOS>
Messrs.
Harter
and
Benjamin
always
kept
a
second
place
of
business
.
<EOS>
Their
great
shop
was
at
the
West
-
end
;
but
they
had
accommodation
in
the
City
.
  
<EOS>
The
chronicler
states
this
at
once
,
as
he
scorns
to
keep
from
his
reader
any
secret
that
is

Lizzie
's
Sick
-
Room
 
<EOS>
When
the
Hertford
Street
robbery
was
three
days
old
,
and
was
still
the
talk
of
all
the
town
,
Lizzie
Eustace
was
really
ill
.
<EOS>
She
had
promised
to
go
down
to
Scotland
in
compliance
with
the
advice
given
to
her
by
her
cousin
Frank
,
and
at
the
moment
of
promising
would
have
been
willing
enough
to
be
transported
at
once
to
Portray
,
had
that
been
possible
 
so
as
to
be
beyond
the
visits
of
policemen
and
the
authority
of
lawyers
and
magistrates
;
but
as
the
hours
passed
over
her
head
,
and
as
her
presence
of
mind
returned
to
her
,
she
remembered
that
even
at
Portray
she
would
not
be
out
of
danger
,
and
that
she
could
do
nothing
in
furtherance
of
her
plans
if
once
immured
there
.
<EOS>
Lord
George
was
in
London
,
Frank
Greystock
was
in
London
,
and
Lord
Fawn
was
in
London
.
<EOS>
It
was
more
than
ever
necessary
to
her
that
she
should
find
a
husband
among
them
,
 
a
husband
who
would
not
be
less
her
husband
when
the
truth
of
that
business
at
Carlisle
should
be
known
to
all
the
world
.
<EOS>
She
had
,
in
fact
,
stolen
nothing
.
<EOS>
She
endeavoured
to
comfort
herself
by
repeating
to
herself
over
and
over
again
that
assurance
.
<EOS>
She
had
stolen
nothing
;
and
she
still
thought
that
if
she
could
obtain
the
support
of
some
strong
arm
on
which
to
lean
,
she
might
escape
punishment
for
those
false
oaths
which
she
had
sworn
.
<EOS>
Her
husband
might
take
her
abroad
,
and
the
whole
thing
would
die
away
.
<EOS>
If
she
should
succeed
with
Lord
George
,
of
course
he
would
take
her
abroad
,
and
there
would
be
no
need
for
any
speedy
return
.
<EOS>
They
might
roam
among
islands
in
pleasant
warm
suns
,
and
the
dreams
of
her
youth
might
be
realised
.
<EOS>
Her
income
was
still
her
own
.
<EOS>
They
could
not
touch
that
.
<EOS>
So
she
thought
,
at
least
,
 
oppressed
by
some
slight
want
of
assurance
in
that
respect
.
<EOS>
Were
she
to
go
at
once
to
Scotland
,
she
must
for
the
present
give
up
that
game
altogether
.
<EOS>
If
Frank
would
pledge
himself
to
become
her
husband
in
three
or
four
,
or
even
in
six
months
,
she
would
go
at
once
.
<EOS>
She
had
more
confidence
in
Frank
than
even
in
Lord
George
.
<EOS>
As
for
love
,
 
she
would
sometimes
tell
herself
that
she
was
violently
in
love
;
but
she
hardly
knew
with
which
.
<EOS>
Lord
George
was
certainly
the
best
representative
of
that
perfect
Corsair
which
her
dreams
had
represented
to
her
;
but
,
in
regard
to
working
life
,
she
thought
that
she
liked
her
cousin
Frank
better
than
she
had
ever
yet
liked
any
other
human
being
.
<EOS>
But
,
in
truth
,
she
was
now
in
that
condition
,
as
she
acknowledged
to
herself
,
that
she
was
hardly
entitled
to
choose
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
had
promised
to
marry
her
,
and
to
him
as
a
husband
she
conceived
that
she
still
had
a
right
.
<EOS>
Nothing
had
as
yet
been
proved
against
her
which
could
justify
him
in
repudiating
his
engagement
.
<EOS>
She
had
,
no
doubt
,
asserted
with
all
vehemence
to
her
cousin
that
no
consideration
would
now
induce
her
to
give
her
hand
to
Lord
Fawn
;
 
and
when
making
that
assurance
she
had
been
,
after
her
nature
,
sincere
.
<EOS>
But
circumstances
were
changed
since
that
.
<EOS>
She
had
not
much
hope
that
Lord
Fawn
might
be
made
to
succumb
,
 
though
evidence
had
reached
her
before
the
last
robbery
which
induced
her
to
believe
that
he
did
not
consider
himself
to
be
quite
secure
.
<EOS>
In
these
circumstances
she
was
unwilling
to
leave
London
though
she
had
promised
,
and
was
hardly
sorry
to
find
an
excuse
in
her
recognised
illness
.
  
<EOS>
And
she
was
ill
.
<EOS>
Though
her
mind
was
again
at
work
with
schemes
on
which
she
would
not
have
busied
herself
without
hope
,
yet
she
had
not
recovered
from
the
actual
bodily
prostration
to
which
she
had
been
compelled
to
give
way
when
first
told
of
the
robbery
on
her
return
from
the
theatre
.
<EOS>
There
had
been
moments
then
in
which
she
thought
that
her
heart
would
have
broken
,
 
moments
in
which
,
but
that
the
power
of
speech
was
wanting
,
she
would
have
told
everything
to
Lucinda
Roanoke
.
<EOS>
When
Mrs.
Carbuncle
was
marching
up
-
stairs
with
the
policemen
at
her
heels
she
would
have
willingly
sold
all
her
hopes
,
Portray
Castle
,
her
lovers
,
her
necklace
,
her
income
,
her
beauty
,
for
any
assurance
of
the
humblest
security
.
<EOS>
With
that
quickness
of
intellect
which
was
her
peculiar
gift
,
she
had
soon
understood
,
in
the
midst
of
her
sufferings
,
that
her
necklace
had
been
taken
by
thieves
whose
robbery
might
assist
her
for
a
while
in
keeping
her
secret
,
rather
than
lead
to
the
immediate
divulging
of
it
.
<EOS>
Neither
Camperdown
nor
Bunfit
had
been
at
work
among
the
boxes
.
<EOS>
Her
secret
had
been
discovered
,
no
doubt
,
by
Patience
Crabstick
,
and
the
diamonds
were
gone
.
<EOS>
But
money
also
was
taken
,
and
the
world
need
not
know
that
the
diamonds
had
been
there
.
<EOS>
But
Lord
George
knew
.
<EOS>
And
then
there
arose
to
her
that
question
:
Had
the
diamonds
been
taken
in
consequence
of
that
revelation
to
Lord
George
?
<EOS>
It
was
not
surprising
that
in
the
midst
of
all
this
Lizzie
should
be
really
ill
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
most
anxious
to
see
Lord
George
;
but
,
if
what
Mrs.
Carbuncle
said
to
her
was
true
,
Lord
George
refused
to
see
her
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
believe
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
and
was
,
therefore
,
quite
in
the
dark
about
her
Corsair
.
<EOS>
As
she
could
only
communicate
with
him
through
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
it
might
well
be
the
case
that
he
should
have
been
told
that
he
could
not
have
access
to
her
.
<EOS>
Of
course
there
were
difficulties
.
<EOS>
That
her
cousin
Frank
should
see
her
in
her
bedroom
,
 
her
cousin
Frank
,
with
whom
it
was
essentially
necessary
that
she
should
hold
counsel
as
to
her
present
great
difficulties
,
 
was
a
matter
of
course
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
hesitation
about
that
.
<EOS>
A
fresh
nightcap
,
and
a
clean
pocket
-
handkerchief
with
a
bit
of
lace
round
it
,
and
,
perhaps
,
some
pretty
covering
to
her
shoulders
if
she
were
to
be
required
to
sit
up
in
bed
,
and
the
thing
was
arranged
.
<EOS>
He
might
have
spent
the
best
part
of
his
days
in
her
bedroom
if
he
could
have
spared
the
time
.
<EOS>
But
the
Corsair
was
not
a
cousin
,
 
nor
as
yet
an
acknowledged
lover
.
<EOS>
There
was
difficulty
even
in
framing
a
reason
for
her
request
,
when
she
made
it
to
Mrs.
Carbuncle
;
and
the
very
reason
which
she
gave
was
handed
back
to
her
as
the
Corsair
's
reason
for
not
coming
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
desired
to
see
him
because
he
had
been
so
much
mixed
up
in
the
matter
of
these
terrible
robberies
.
<EOS>
But
Mrs.
Carbuncle
declared
to
her
that
Lord
George
would
not
come
to
her
because
his
name
had
been
so
frequently
mentioned
in
connexion
with
the
diamonds
.
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
"
there
can
be
no
real
reason
for
his
seeing
you
up
in
your
bedroom
.
<EOS>
If
there
had
been
anything
between
you
,
as
I
once
thought
there
would
 
<EOS>
"
There
was
something
in
the
tone
of
Mrs.
Carbuncle
's
voice
which
grated
on
Lizzie
's
ear
,
 
something
which
seemed
to
imply
that
all
that
prospect
was
over
.
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
,
"
said
Lizzie
querulously
,
"
I
am
very
anxious
to
know
what
he
thinks
.
<EOS>
I
care
more
about
his
opinion
than
anybody
else
's
.
<EOS>
As
to
his
name
being
mixed
up
in
it
,
 
that
is
all
a
joke
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
has
been
no
joke
to
him
<EOS>
,
I
can
assure
you
,
"
said
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
could
not
press
her
request
.
<EOS>
Of
course
,
she
knew
more
about
it
than
did
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
<EOS>
The
secret
was
in
her
own
bosom
,
 
the
secret
as
to
the
midnight
robbery
at
Carlisle
,
and
that
secret
she
had
told
to
Lord
George
.
<EOS>
As
to
the
robbery
in
London
she
knew
nothing
,
 
except
that
it
had
been
perpetrated
through
the
treachery
of
Patience
Crabstick
.
<EOS>
Did
Lord
George
know
more
about
it
than
she
knew
?
 
<EOS>
and
if
so
,
was
he
now
deterred
by
that
knowledge
from
visiting
her
?
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
"
that
a
gentleman
visiting
a
lady
with
whom
he
has
no
connexion
,
in
her
bedroom
,
is
in
itself
something
very
peculiar
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Lizzie
made
a
motion
of
impatience
under
the
bedclothes
.
<EOS>
Any
such
argument
was
trash
to
her
,
and
she
knew
that
it
was
trash
to
Mrs.
Carbuncle
also
.
<EOS>
What
was
one
man
in
her
bedroom
more
than
another
?
<EOS>
She
could
see
a
dozen
doctors
if
she
pleased
,
and
if
so
,
why
not
this
man
,
whose
real
powers
of
doctoring
her
would
be
so
much
more
efficacious
?
<EOS>
"
You
would
want
to
see
him
alone
,
too
,
"
continued
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
"
and
,
of
course
,
the
police
would
hear
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
at
all
surprised
that
he
should
stay
away
.
<EOS>
"
Lizzie
's
condition
did
not
admit
of
much
argument
on
her
side
,
and
she
only
showed
her
opposition
to
Mrs.
Carbuncle
by
being
cross
and
querulous
.
  
<EOS>
Frank
Greystock
came
to
her
with
great
constancy
almost
every
day
,
and
from
him
she
did
hear
about
the
robbery
all
that
he
knew
or
heard
.
<EOS>
When
three
days
had
passed
,
 
when
six
days
,
and
even
when
ten
days
were
gone
,
nobody
had
been
as
yet
arrested
.
<EOS>
The
police
,
according
to
Frank
,
were
much
on
the
alert
,
but
were
very
secret
.
<EOS>
They
either
would
not
,
or
could
not
,
tell
anything
.
<EOS>
To
him
the
two
robberies
,
that
at
Carlisle
and
the
last
affair
in
Hertford
Street
,
were
of
course
distinct
.
<EOS>
There
were
those
who
believed
that
the
Hertford
Street
thieves
and
the
Carlisle
thieves
were
not
only
the
same
,
but
that
they
had
been
in
quest
of
the
same
plunder
,
 
and
had
at
last
succeeded
.
<EOS>
But
Frank
was
not
one
of
these
.
<EOS>
He
never
for
a
moment
doubted
that
the
diamonds
had
been
taken
at
Carlisle
,
and
explained
the
second
robbery
by
the
supposition
that
Patience
Crabstick
had
been
emboldened
by
success
.
<EOS>
The
iron
box
had
no
doubt
been
taken
by
her
assistance
,
and
her
familiarity
with
the
thieves
,
then
established
,
had
led
to
the
second
robbery
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
's
loss
in
that
second
robbery
had
amounted
to
some
hundred
pounds
.
<EOS>
This
was
Frank
Greystock
's
theory
,
and
of
course
it
was
one
very
comfortable
to
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
all
seem
to
think
that
the
diamonds
are
at
Paris
,
"
he
said
to
her
one
day
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
only
knew
how
little
I
care
about
them
.
<EOS>
It
seems
as
though
I
had
almost
forgotten
them
in
these
after
troubles
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Camperdown
cares
about
them
.
<EOS>
I
'm
told
he
says
that
he
can
make
you
pay
for
them
out
of
your
jointure
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
That
would
be
very
terrible
,
of
course
,
"
said
Lizzie
,
to
whose
mind
there
was
something
consolatory
in
the
idea
that
the
whole
affair
of
the
robbery
might
perhaps
remain
so
mysterious
as
to
remove
her
from
the
danger
of
other
punishment
than
this
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
feel
sure
that
he
could
n't
do
it
,
"
said
Frank
,
"
and
<EOS>
I
do
n't
think
he
'll
try
it
.
<EOS>
John
Eustace
would
not
let
him
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
persecution
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Camperdown
has
always
chosen
to
persecute
me
,
"
said
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
understand
that
he
should
n't
like
the
loss
of
the
diamonds
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
think
,
Lizzie
,
you
ever
realised
their
true
value
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
not
.
<EOS>
After
all
,
a
necklace
is
only
a
necklace
.
<EOS>
I
cared
nothing
for
it
,
 
except
that
I
could
not
bear
the
idea
that
that
man
should
dictate
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
would
have
given
it
up
at
once
,
at
the
slightest
word
from
you
.
"
<EOS>
He
did
not
care
to
remind
her
then
,
as
she
lay
in
bed
,
that
he
had
been
very
urgent
in
his
advice
to
her
to
abandon
the
diamonds
,
 
and
not
the
less
urgent
because
he
had
thought
that
the
demand
for
them
was
unjust
.
<EOS>
"
I
told
you
often
,
"
she
continued
,
"
that
I
was
tempted
to
throw
them
among
the
waves
.
<EOS>
It
was
true
;
 
quite
true
.
<EOS>
I
offered
to
give
them
to
you
,
and
should
have
been
delighted
to
have
been
relieved
from
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
was
,
of
course
,
simply
impossible
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
it
was
;
 
impossible
on
your
part
;
but
I
would
have
been
delighted
.
<EOS>
Of
what
use
were
they
to
me
?
<EOS>
I
wore
them
twice
because
that
man
,
"
 
meaning
Lord
Fawn
,
 
"
disputed
my
right
to
them
.
<EOS>
Before
that
I
never
even
looked
at
them
.
<EOS>
Do
you
think
I
had
pleasure
in
wearing
them
,
or
pleasure
in
looking
at
them
?
<EOS>
Never
.
<EOS>
They
were
only
a
trouble
to
me
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
point
of
honour
with
me
to
keep
them
,
because
I
was
attacked
.
<EOS>
But
I
am
glad
they
are
gone
,
 
thoroughly
glad
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
This
was
all
very
well
,
and
was
not
without
its
effect
on
Frank
Greystock
.
<EOS>
It
is
hardly
expected
of
a
woman
in
such
a
condition
,
with
so
many
troubles
on
her
mind
,
who
had
been
so
persecuted
,
that
every
word
uttered
by
her
should
be
strictly
true
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
,
with
her
fresh
nightcap
,
and
her
laced
handkerchief
,
pale
,
and
with
her
eyes
just
glittering
with
tears
,
was
very
pretty
.
<EOS>
"
Did
n't
somebody
once
give
some
one
a
garment
which
scorched
him
up
when
he
wore
it
,
 
some
woman
who
sent
it
because
she
loved
the
man
so
much
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
shirt
,
you
mean
,
which
Dejanira
sent
to
Hercules
.
<EOS>
Yes
;
 
Hercules
was
a
good
deal
scorched
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
that
necklace
,
which
my
husband
gave
me
because
he
loved
me
so
well
,
has
scorched
me
horribly
.
<EOS>
It
has
nearly
killed
me
.
<EOS>
It
has
been
like
the
white
elephant
which
the
Eastern
king
gives
to
his
subject
when
he
means
to
ruin
him
.
<EOS>
Only
poor
Florian
did
n't
mean
to
hurt
me
.
<EOS>
He
gave
it
all
in
love
.
<EOS>
If
these
people
bring
a
lawsuit
against
me
,
Frank
,
you
must
manage
it
for
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
will
be
no
lawsuit
.
<EOS>
Your
brother
-
in
-
law
will
stop
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
who
will
really
get
the
diamonds
after
all
,
Frank
?
<EOS>
They
were
very
valuable
.
<EOS>
Only
think
that
the
ten
thousand
pounds
should
disappear
in
such
a
way
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
subject
was
a
very
dangerous
one
,
but
there
was
a
fascination
about
it
which
made
it
impossible
for
her
to
refrain
from
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
dishonest
dealer
in
diamonds
will
probably
realise
the
plunder
,
 
after
some
years
.
<EOS>
There
would
be
something
very
alluring
in
the
theft
of
articles
of
great
value
,
were
it
not
that
,
when
got
,
they
at
once
become
almost
valueless
by
the
difficulty
of
dealing
with
them
.
<EOS>
Supposing
<EOS>
I
had
the
necklace
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
you
had
,
Frank
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
could
do
nothing
with
it
.
<EOS>
Ten
sovereigns
would
go
further
with
me
,
 
or
ten
shillings
.
<EOS>
The
burthen
of
possessing
it
would
in
itself
be
almost
more
than
I
could
bear
.
<EOS>
The
knowledge
that
I
had
the
thing
,
and
might
be
discovered
in
having
it
,
would
drive
me
mad
.
<EOS>
By
my
own
weakness
I
should
be
compelled
to
tell
my
secret
to
some
one
.
<EOS>
And
then
I
should
never
sleep
for
fear
my
partner
in
the
matter
should
turn
against
me
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
How
well
she
understood
it
all
!
<EOS>
How
probable
it
was
that
Lord
George
should
turn
against
her
!
<EOS>
How
exact
was
Frank
's
description
of
that
burthen
of
a
secret
so
heavy
that
it
can
not
be
borne
alone
!
"
<EOS>
A
little
reflection
,
"
continued
Frank
,
"
soon
convinces
a
man
that
rough
downright
stealing
is
an
awkward
,
foolish
trade
;
and
it
therefore
falls
into
the
hands
of
those
who
want
education
for
the
higher
efforts
of
dishonesty
.
<EOS>
To
get
into
a
bank
at
midnight
and
steal
what
little
there
may
be
in
the
till
,
or
even
an
armful
of
bank
-
notes
,
with
the
probability
of
a
policeman
catching
you
as
you
creep
out
of
the
chimney
and
through
a
hole
,
is
clumsy
work
;
but
to
walk
in
amidst
the
smiles
and
bows
of
admiring
managers
and
draw
out
money
over
the
counter
by
thousands
and
tens
of
thousands
,
which
you
have
never
put
in
and
which
you
can
never
repay
,
and
which
,
when
all
is
done
,
you
have
only
borrowed
;
 
that
is
a
great
feat
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
really
think
so
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
courage
,
the
ingenuity
,
and
the
self
-
confidence
needed
are
certainly
admirable
.
<EOS>
And
then
there
is
a
cringing
and
almost
contemptible
littleness
about
honesty
,
which
hardly
allows
it
to
assert
itself
.
<EOS>
The
really
honest
man
can
never
say
a
word
to
make
those
who
do
n't
know
of
his
honesty
believe
that
it
is
there
.
<EOS>
He
has
one
foot
in
the
grave
before
his
neighbours
have
learned
that
he
is
possessed
of
an
article
for
the
use
of
which
they
would
so
willingly
have
paid
,
could
they
have
been
made
to
see
that
it
was
there
.
<EOS>
The
dishonest
man
almost
doubts
whether
in
him
dishonesty
is
dishonest
,
<EOS>
let
it
be
practised
ever
so
widely
.
<EOS>
The
honest
man
almost
doubts
whether
his
honesty
be
honest
,
unless
it
be
kept
hidden
.
<EOS>
Let
two
unknown
men
be
competitors
for
any
place
,
with
nothing
to
guide
the
judges
but
their
own
words
and
their
own
looks
,
and
who
can
doubt
but
the
dishonest
man
would
be
chosen
rather
than
the
honest
?
<EOS>
Honesty
goes
about
with
a
hang
-
dog
look
about
him
,
as
though
knowing
that
he
can
not
be
trusted
till
he
be
proved
.
<EOS>
Dishonesty
carries
his
eyes
high
,
and
assumes
that
any
question
respecting
him
must
be
considered
to
be
unnecessary
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Frank
,
what
a
philosopher
you
are
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
yes
;
meditating
about
your
diamonds
has
brought
my
philosophy
out
.
<EOS>
When
do
you
think
you
will
go
to
Scotland
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
hardly
strong
enough
for
the
journey
yet
.
<EOS>
I
fear
the
cold
so
much
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
would
not
find
it
cold
there
by
the
sea
-
side
.
<EOS>
To
tell
you
the
truth
,
Lizzie
,
I
want
to
get
you
out
of
this
house
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
mean
to
say
a
word
against
Mrs.
Carbuncle
;
but
after
all
that
has
occurred
,
it
would
be
better
that
you
should
be
away
.
<EOS>
People
talk
about
you
and
Lord
George
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
can
I
help
it
,
Frank
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
By
going
away
;
 
that
is
,
if
I
may
presume
one
thing
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
want
to
pry
into
your
secrets
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
none
from
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Unless
there
be
truth
in
the
assertion
that
you
are
engaged
to
marry
Lord
George
Carruthers
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
no
truth
in
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
do
not
wish
to
stay
here
in
order
that
there
may
be
an
engagement
?
<EOS>
I
am
obliged
to
ask
you
home
questions
,
Lizzie
,
as
I
could
not
otherwise
advise
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
,
indeed
,
ask
home
questions
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
desist
at
once
,
if
they
be
disagreeable
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Frank
,
you
are
false
to
me
!
"
<EOS>
As
she
said
this
she
rose
in
her
bed
,
and
sat
with
her
eyes
fixed
upon
his
,
and
her
thin
hands
stretched
out
upon
the
bedclothes
.
<EOS>
"
You
know
that
I
can
not
wish
to
be
engaged
to
him
or
to
any
other
man
.
<EOS>
You
know
,
better
almost
than
I
can
know
myself
,
how
my
heart
stands
.
<EOS>
There
has
,
at
any
rate
,
been
no
hypocrisy
with
me
in
regard
to
you
.
<EOS>
Everything
has
been
told
to
you
;
 
at
what
cost
<EOS>
I
will
not
now
say
.
<EOS>
The
honest
woman
,
I
fear
,
fares
worse
even
than
the
honest
man
of
whom
you
spoke
.
<EOS>
I
think
you
admitted
that
he
would
be
appreciated
at
last
.
<EOS>
She
to
her
dying
day
must
pay
the
penalty
of
her
transgressions
.
<EOS>
Honesty
in
a
woman
the
world
never
forgives
.
<EOS>
"
When
she
had
done
speaking
,
he
sat
silent
by
her
bedside
,
but
,
almost
unconsciously
,
he
stretched
out
his
left
hand
and
took
her
right
hand
in
his
.
<EOS>
For
a
few
seconds
she
admitted
this
,
and
she
lay
there
with
their
hands
clasped
.
<EOS>
Then
with
a
start
she
drew
back
her
arm
,
and
retreated
as
it
were
from
his
touch
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
How
dare
you
,
"
she
said
,
"
press
my
hand
,
when
you
know
that
such
pressure
from
you
is
treacherous
and
damnable
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Damnable
,
Lizzie
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
 
damnable
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
pick
my
words
for
you
.
<EOS>
Coming
from
you
,
what
does
such
pressure
mean
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Affection
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Yes
;
 
and
of
what
sort
?
<EOS>
You
are
wicked
enough
to
feed
my
love
by
such
tokens
,
when
you
know
that
you
do
not
mean
to
return
it
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
Frank
,
Frank
,
will
you
give
me
back
my
heart
?
<EOS>
What
was
it
that
you
promised
me
when
we
sat
together
upon
the
rocks
at
Portray
?
"
  
<EOS>
It
is
inexpressibly
difficult
for
a
man
to
refuse
the
tender
of
a
woman
's
love
.
<EOS>
We
may
almost
say
that
a
man
should
do
so
as
a
matter
of
course
,
 
that
the
thing
so
offered
becomes
absolutely
valueless
by
the
offer
,
 
that
the
woman
who
can
make
it
has
put
herself
out
of
court
by
her
own
abandonment
of
the
privileges
due
to
her
as
a
woman
,
 
that
stern
rebuke
and
even
expressed
contempt
are
justified
by
such
conduct
,
 
and
that
the
fairest
beauty
and
most
alluring
charms
of
feminine
grace
should
lose
their
attraction
when
thus
tendered
openly
in
the
market
.
<EOS>
No
doubt
such
is
our
theory
as
to
love
and
love
-
making
.
<EOS>
But
the
action
to
be
taken
by
us
in
matters
as
to
which
the
plainest
theory
prevails
for
the
guidance
of
our
practice
,
depends
so
frequently
on
accompanying
circumstances
and
correlative
issues
,
that
the
theory
,
as
often
as
not
,
falls
to
the
ground
.
<EOS>
Frank
could
not
despise
this
woman
,
and
could
not
be
stern
to
her
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
bring
himself
to
tell
her
boldly
that
he
would
have
nothing
to
say
to
her
in
the
way
of
love
.
<EOS>
He
made
excuses
for
her
,
and
persuaded
himself
that
there
were
peculiar
circumstances
in
her
position
justifying
unwomanly
conduct
,
although
,
had
he
examined
himself
on
the
subject
,
he
would
have
found
it
difficult
to
say
what
those
circumstances
were
.
<EOS>
She
was
rich
,
beautiful
,
clever
,
 
and
<EOS>
he
was
flattered
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
he
knew
that
he
could
not
marry
her
;
 
and
he
knew
also
that
much
as
he
liked
her
<EOS>
he
did
not
love
her
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Lizzie
,
"
he
said
,
"
I
think
you
hardly
understand
my
position
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
do
.
<EOS>
That
little
girl
has
cozened
you
out
of
a
promise
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
If
it
be
so
,
you
would
not
have
me
break
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
would
,
if
you
think
she
is
not
fit
to
be
your
wife
.
<EOS>
Is
a
man
such
as
you
are
,
to
be
tied
by
the
leg
for
life
,
have
all
his
ambition
clipped
,
and
his
high
hopes
shipwrecked
,
because
a
girl
has
been
clever
enough
to
extract
a
word
from
him
?
<EOS>
Is
it
not
true
that
you
are
in
debt
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
of
that
?
<EOS>
At
any
rate
,
Lizzie
,
I
do
not
want
help
from
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
so
like
a
man
's
pride
!
<EOS>
Do
we
not
all
know
that
in
such
a
career
as
you
have
marked
out
for
yourself
,
wealth
,
or
at
any
rate
an
easy
income
,
is
necessary
?
<EOS>
Do
you
think
that
I
can
not
put
two
and
two
together
?
<EOS>
Do
you
believe
so
meanly
of
me
as
to
imagine
that
I
should
have
said
to
you
what
I
have
said
,
if
I
did
not
know
that
I
could
help
you
?
<EOS>
A
man
,
I
believe
,
can
not
understand
that
love
which
induces
a
woman
to
sacrifice
her
pride
simply
for
his
advantage
.
<EOS>
I
want
to
see
you
prosper
.
<EOS>
I
want
to
see
you
a
great
man
and
a
lord
,
and
I
know
that
you
can
not
become
so
without
an
income
.
<EOS>
Ah
,
I
wish
I
could
give
you
all
that
I
have
got
,
and
save
you
from
the
encumbrance
that
is
attached
to
it
!
"
  
<EOS>
It
might
be
that
he
would
then
have
told
her
of
his
engagement
to
Lucy
,
and
of
his
resolution
to
adhere
to
that
promise
,
had
not
Mrs.
Carbuncle
at
that
moment
entered
the
room
.
<EOS>
Frank
had
been
there
for
above
an
hour
,
and
as
Lizzie
was
still
an
invalid
,
and
to
some
extent
under
the
care
of
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
it
was
natural
that
that
lady
should
interfere
.
<EOS>
"
You
know
,
my
dear

you
should
not
exhaust
yourself
altogether

<EOS>
Mr.
Emilius
is
to
come
to
you
this
afternoon

"
  
<EOS>

Mr.

Greystock

<EOS>

Yes

the
clergyman

Do
n't
you
remember
him
at
Portray
?
<EOS>
A
dark
man
with
eyes
close
together
!
<EOS>
You
used
to
be
very
wicked
,
and
say
that
he
was
once
a
Jew
-
boy
in
the
streets
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Lizzie
,
as
she
spoke
of
her
spiritual
guide
,
was
evidently
not
desirous
of
doing
him
much
honour
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
remember
him
well
enough
.
<EOS>
He
made
sheep
's
eyes
at
Miss
Macnulty
,
and
drank
a
great
deal
of
wine
at
dinner
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Poor
Macnulty
!
<EOS>
I
do
n't
believe
a
word
about
the
wine
;
and
as
for
Macnulty
,
I
do
n't
see
why
she
should
not
be
converted
as
well
as
another
.
<EOS>
He
is
coming
here
to
read
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
hope
you
do
n't
object

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
in
the
least
;
 
if
you
like
it

"
One
does
have
solemn
thoughts
sometimes
,
Frank
,
 
especially
when
one
is
ill
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
yes

<EOS>
Well
or
ill

one
does
have
solemn
thoughts

ghosts

it
were

will
appear

But
is
Mr.
Emilius
good
at
laying
such
apparitions
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
a
clergyman
,
Mr.
Greystock
,
"
said
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
with
something
of
rebuke
in
her
voice
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
they
tell
me
.
<EOS>
I
was
not
present
at
his
ordination
,
but
I
daresay
it
was
done
according
to
rule
.
<EOS>
When
one
reflects
what
a
deal
of
harm
a
bishop
may
do
,
one
wishes
that
there
was
some
surer
way
of
getting
bishops
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
you
know
anything
against
Mr.
Emilius
?
"
asked
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nothing
at
all
but
his
looks
,
and
manners
,
and
voice
,
 
unless
it
be
that
he
preaches
popular
sermons
,
and
drinks
too
much
wine
,
and
makes
sheep
's
eyes
at
Miss
Macnulty
.
<EOS>
Look
after
your
silver
spoons
,
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
 
if
the
last
thieves
have
left
you
any
.
<EOS>
You
were
asking
after
the
fate
of
your
diamonds
,
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
they
will
endow
a
Protestant
church
in
Mr.
Emilius
's
native
land
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Emilius
did
come
and
read
to
Lady
Eustace
that
afternoon
.
<EOS>
A
clergyman
is
as
privileged
to
enter
the
bedroom
of
a
sick
lady
as
is
a
doctor
or
a
cousin
.
<EOS>
There
was
another
clean
cap
,
and
another
laced
handkerchief
,
and
on
this
occasion
a
little
shawl
over
Lizzie
's
shoulders
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Emilius
first
said
a
prayer
,
kneeling
at
Lizzie
's
bedside
;
then
he
read
a
chapter
in
the
Bible
;
 
and
after
that
he
read
the
first
half
of
the
fourth
canto
of
Childe
Harold
so
well
,
that
Lizzie
felt
for
the
moment
that
after
all
,
poetry
was
life
and
life
was
poetry
.

"
I
Suppose
I
May
Say
a
Word
"
 
The
second
robbery
to
which
Lady
Eustace
had
been
subjected
by
no
means
decreased
the
interest
which
was
attached
to
her
and
her
concerns
in
the
fashionable
world
.
<EOS>
Parliament
had
now
met
,
and
the
party
at
Matching
Priory
,
 
Lady
Glencora
Palliser
's
party
in
the
country
,
 
had
been
to
some
extent
broken
up
.
<EOS>
All
those
gentlemen
who
were
engaged
in
the
service
of
Her
Majesty
's
Government
had
necessarily
gone
to
London
,
and
they
who
had
wives
at
Matching
had
taken
their
wives
with
them
.
<EOS>
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Bonteen
had
seen
the
last
of
their
holiday
;
Mr.
Palliser
himself
was
,
of
course
,
at
his
post
;
and
all
the
private
secretaries
were
with
the
public
secretaries
on
the
scene
of
action
.
<EOS>
On
the
13th
of
February
Mr.
Palliser
made
his
first
great
statement
in
Parliament
on
the
matter
of
the
five
-
farthinged
penny
,
and
pledged
himself
to
do
his
very
best
to
carry
that
stupendous
measure
through
Parliament
in
the
present
session
.
<EOS>
The
City
men
who
were
in
the
House
that
night
,
 
and
all
the
Directors
of
the
Bank
of
England
were
in
the
gallery
,
and
every
chairman
of
a
great
banking
company
,
and
every
Baring
and
every
Rothschild
,
if
there
be
Barings
and
Rothschilds
who
have
not
been
returned
by
constituencies
,
and
have
not
seats
in
the
House
by
right
,
 
<EOS>
agreed
in
declaring
that
the
job
in
hand
was
too
much
for
any
one
member
or
any
one
session
.
<EOS>
Some
said
that
such
a
measure
never
could
be
passed
,
because
the
unfinished
work
of
one
session
could
not
be
used
in
lessening
the
labours
of
the
next
.
<EOS>
Everything
must
be
recommenced
;
and
therefore
,
 
so
said
these
hopeless
ones
,
 
the
penny
with
five
farthings
,
the
penny
of
which
a
hundred
would
make
ten
shillings
,
the
halcyon
penny
,
which
would
make
all
future
pecuniary
calculations
easy
to
the
meanest
British
capacity
,
could
never
become
the
law
of
the
land
.
<EOS>
Others
,
more
hopeful
,
were
willing
to
believe
that
gradually
the
thing
would
so
sink
into
the
minds
of
members
of
Parliament
,
of
writers
of
leading
articles
,
and
of
the
active
public
generally
,
as
to
admit
of
certain
established
axioms
being
taken
as
established
,
and
placed
,
as
it
were
,
beyond
the
procrastinating
power
of
debate
.
<EOS>
It
might
,
for
instance
,
at
last
be
taken
for
granted
that
a
decimal
system
was
desirable
,
 
so
that
a
month
or
two
of
the
spring
need
not
be
consumed
on
that
preliminary
question
.
<EOS>
But
this
period
had
not
as
yet
been
reached
,
and
it
was
thought
by
the
entire
City
that
Mr.
Palliser
was
much
too
sanguine
.
<EOS>
It
was
so
probable
,
many
said
,
that
he
might
kill
himself
by
labour
which
would
be
Herculean
in
all
but
success
,
and
that
no
financier
after
him
would
venture
to
face
the
task
.
<EOS>
It
behoved
Lady
Glencora
to
see
that
her
Hercules
did
not
kill
himself
.
  
<EOS>
In
this
state
of
affairs
Lady
Glencora
,
 
into
whose
hands
the
custody
of
Mr.
Palliser
's
uncle
,
the
duke
,
had
now
altogether
fallen
,
 
had
a
divided
duty
between
Matching
and
London
.
<EOS>
When
the
members
of
Parliament
went
up
to
London
,
she
went
there
also
,
leaving
some
half
-
dozen
friends
whom
she
could
trust
to
amuse
the
duke
;
but
she
soon
returned
,
knowing
that
there
might
be
danger
in
a
long
absence
.
<EOS>
The
duke
,
though
old
,
was
his
own
master
;
he
much
affected
the
company
of
Madame
Goesler
,
and
that
lady
's
kindness
to
him
was
considerate
and
incessant
;
but
there
might
still
be
danger
,
and
Lady
Glencora
felt
that
she
was
responsible
that
the
old
nobleman
should
do
nothing
,
in
the
feebleness
of
age
,
to
derogate
from
the
splendour
of
his
past
life
.
<EOS>
What
if
some
day
his
grace
should
be
off
to
Paris
and
insist
on
making
Madame
Goesler
a
duchess
in
the
chapel
of
the
Embassy
!
<EOS>
Madame
Goesler
had
hitherto
behaved
very
well
;
 
would
probably
continue
to
behave
well
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
really
loved
Madame
Goesler
.
<EOS>
But
then
the
interests
at
stake
were
very
great
!
<EOS>
So
circumstanced
,
Lady
Glencora
found
herself
compelled
to
be
often
on
the
road
between
Matching
and
London
.
  
<EOS>
But
though
she
was
burthened
with
great
care
,
Lady
Glencora
by
no
means
dropped
her
interest
in
the
Eustace
diamonds
;
and
when
she
learned
that
on
the
top
of
the
great
Carlisle
robbery
a
second
robbery
had
been
superadded
,
and
that
this
had
been
achieved
while
all
the
London
police
were
yet
astray
about
the
former
operation
,
her
solicitude
was
of
course
enhanced
.
<EOS>
The
duke
himself
,
too
,
took
the
matter
up
so
strongly
,
that
he
almost
wanted
to
be
carried
up
to
London
,
with
some
view
,
as
it
was
supposed
by
the
ladies
who
were
so
good
to
him
,
of
seeing
Lady
Eustace
personally
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
out
of
the
question
,
my
dear
,
"
Lady
Glencora
said
to
Madame
Goesler
,
when
the
duke
's
fancy
was
first
mentioned
to
her
by
that
lady
.
<EOS>
"
I
told
him
that
the
trouble
would
be
too
much
for
him
.
"
<EOS>
"
Of
course
it
would
be
too
much
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
quite
out
of
the
question
.
"
<EOS>
Then
,
after
a
moment
,
she
added
in
a
whisper
,
"
Who
knows
but
what
he
'd
insist
on
marrying
her
!
<EOS>
It
is
n't
every
woman
that
can
resist
temptation
.
"
<EOS>
Madame
Goesler
smiled
,
and
shook
her
head
,
but
made
no
answer
to
Lady
Glencora
's
suggestion
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
assured
her
uncle
that
everything
should
be
told
to
him
.
<EOS>
She
would
write
about
it
daily
,
and
send
him
the
latest
news
by
the
wires
if
the
post
should
be
too
slow
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
;
 
yes
,
"
said
the
duke
;
"
I
like
telegrams
best
.
<EOS>
I
think
,
you
know
,
that
that
Lord
George
Carruthers
has
had
something
to
do
with
it
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
,
Madame
Goesler
?
<EOS>
"
It
had
long
been
evident
that
the
duke
was
anxious
that
one
of
his
own
order
should
be
proved
to
have
been
the
thief
,
as
the
plunder
taken
was
so
lordly
.
  
<EOS>
In
regard
to
Lizzie
herself
,
Lady
Glencora
,
on
her
return
to
London
,
took
it
into
her
head
to
make
a
diversion
in
our
heroine
's
favour
.
<EOS>
It
had
hitherto
been
a
matter
of
faith
with
all
the
Liberal
party
that
Lady
Eustace
had
had
something
to
do
with
stealing
her
own
diamonds
.
<EOS>
That
esprit
de
corps
which
is
the
glorious
characteristic
of
English
statesmen
had
caused
the
whole
Government
to
support
Lord
Fawn
,
and
Lord
Fawn
could
only
be
supported
on
the
supposition
that
Lizzie
Eustace
had
been
a
wicked
culprit
.
<EOS>
But
Lady
Glencora
,
though
very
true
as
a
politician
,
was
apt
to
have
opinions
of
her
own
,
and
to
take
certain
flights
in
which
she
chose
that
others
of
the
party
should
follow
her
.
<EOS>
She
now
expressed
an
opinion
that
Lady
Eustace
was
a
victim
,
and
all
the
Mrs.
Bonteens
,
with
some
even
of
the
Mr.
Bonteens
,
found
themselves
compelled
to
agree
with
her
.
<EOS>
She
stood
too
high
among
her
set
to
be
subject
to
that
obedience
which
restrained
others
,
 
too
high
,
also
,
for
others
to
resist
her
leading
.
<EOS>
As
a
member
of
a
party
she
was
erratic
and
dangerous
,
but
from
her
position
and
peculiar
temperament
she
was
powerful
.
<EOS>
When
she
declared
that
poor
Lady
Eustace
was
a
victim
,
others
were
obliged
to
say
so
too
.
<EOS>
This
was
particularly
hard
upon
Lord
Fawn
,
and
the
more
so
as
Lady
Glencora
took
upon
her
to
assert
that
Lord
Fawn
had
no
right
to
jilt
the
young
woman
.
<EOS>
And
Lady
Glencora
had
this
to
support
her
views
,
 
that
,
for
the
last
week
past
,
indeed
ever
since
the
depositions
which
had
been
taken
after
the
robbery
in
Hertford
Street
,
the
police
had
expressed
no
fresh
suspicions
in
regard
to
Lizzie
Eustace
.
<EOS>
She
heard
daily
from
Barrington
Erle
that
Major
Mackintosh
and
Bunfit
and
Gager
were
as
active
as
ever
in
their
inquiries
,
that
all
Scotland
Yard
was
determined
to
unravel
the
mystery
,
and
that
there
were
emissaries
at
work
tracking
the
diamonds
at
Hamburg
,
Paris
,
Vienna
,
and
New
York
.
<EOS>
It
had
been
whispered
to
Mr.
Erle
that
the
whereabouts
of
Patience
Crabstick
had
been
discovered
,
and
that
many
of
the
leading
thieves
in
London
were
assisting
the
police
;
 
but
nothing
more
was
done
in
the
way
of
fixing
any
guilt
upon
Lizzie
Eustace
.
"
<EOS>
Upon
my
word
,
I
am
beginning
to
think
that
she
has
been
more
sinned
against
than
sinning
.
<EOS>
"
This
was
said
to
Lady
Glencora
on
the
morning
after
Mr.
Palliser
's
great
speech
about
the
five
farthings
,
by
Barrington
Erle
,
who
,
as
it
seemed
,
had
been
specially
told
off
by
the
party
to
watch
this
investigation
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
she
has
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
.
<EOS>
I
have
thought
so
ever
since
the
last
robbery
.
<EOS>
Sir
Simon
Slope
told
me
yesterday
afternoon
that
Mr.
Camperdown
has
given
it
up
altogether
.
"
<EOS>
Sir
Simon
Slope
was
the
Solicitor
-
General
of
that
day
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
absurd
for
him
to
go
on
with
his
bill
in
Chancery
now
that
the
diamonds
are
gone
,
 
unless
he
meant
to
make
her
pay
for
them
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
would
be
rank
persecution
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
she
has
been
persecuted
.
<EOS>
I
shall
call
upon
her
.
"
<EOS>
Then
she
wrote
the
following
letter
to
the
duke
:
    
February
14
,
18
 
.
  
<EOS>
MY
DEAR
DUKE
,
  
Plantagenet
was
on
his
legs
last
night
for
three
hours
and
three
quarters
,
and
I
sat
through
it
all
.
<EOS>
As
far
as
I
could
observe
through
the
bars
<EOS>
I
was
the
only
person
in
the
House
who
listened
to
him
.
<EOS>
I
'm
sure
Mr.
Gresham
was
fast
asleep
.
<EOS>
It
was
quite
piteous
to
see
some
of
them
yawning
.
<EOS>
Plantagenet
did
it
very
well
,
and
I
almost
think
I
understood
him
.
<EOS>
They
seem
to
say
that
nobody
on
the
other
side
will
take
trouble
enough
to
make
a
regular
opposition
,
but
that
there
are
men
in
the
City
who
will
write
letters
to
the
newspapers
,
and
get
up
a
sort
of
Bank
clamour
.
<EOS>
Plantagenet
says
nothing
about
it
,
but
there
is
a
do
-
or
-
die
manner
with
him
which
is
quite
tragical
.
<EOS>
The
House
was
up
at
eleven
,
when
he
came
home
and
eat
three
oysters
,
drank
a
glass
of
beer
,
and
slept
well
.
<EOS>
They
say
the
real
work
will
come
when
it
's
in
Committee
;
 
that
is
,
if
it
gets
there
.
<EOS>
The
bill
is
to
be
brought
in
,
and
will
be
read
the
first
time
next
Monday
week
.
  
<EOS>
As
to
the
robberies
,
I
believe
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
police
have
got
hold
of
the
young
woman
.
<EOS>
They
do
n't
arrest
her
,
but
deal
with
her
in
a
friendly
sort
of
way
.
<EOS>
Barrington
Erle
says
that
a
sergeant
is
to
marry
her
in
order
to
make
quite
sure
of
her
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
they
know
their
business
;
but
that
would
n't
strike
me
as
being
the
safest
way
.
<EOS>
They
seem
to
think
the
diamonds
went
to
Paris
but
have
since
been
sent
on
to
New
York
.
  
<EOS>
As
to
the
little
widow
,
I
do
believe
she
has
been
made
a
victim
.
<EOS>
She
first
lost
her
diamonds
,
and
now
her
other
jewels
and
her
money
have
gone
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
see
what
she
was
to
gain
by
treachery
,
and
I
think
she
has
been
ill
-
used
.
<EOS>
She
is
staying
at
the
house
of
that
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
but
all
the
same
I
shall
go
and
call
on
her
.
<EOS>
I
wish
you
could
see
her
,
because
she
is
such
a
little
beauty
;
 
just
what
you
would
like
;
not
so
much
colour
as
our
friend
,
but
perfect
features
,
with
infinite
play
,
 
not
perhaps
always
in
the
very
best
taste
;
but
then
we
ca
n't
have
everything
;
<EOS>
can
we
,
dear
duke
?
  
<EOS>
As
to
the
real
thief
;
 
of
course
you
must
burn
this
at
once
,
and
keep
it
strictly
private
as
coming
from
me
;
 
<EOS>
I
fancy
that
delightful
Scotch
lord
managed
it
entirely
.
<EOS>
The
idea
is
,
that
he
did
it
on
commission
for
the
Jew
jewellers
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
suppose
he
had
money
enough
to
carry
it
out
himself
.
<EOS>
As
to
the
second
robbery
,
whether
he
had
or
had
not
a
hand
in
that
,
I
ca
n't
make
up
my
mind
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
see
why
he
should
n't
.
<EOS>
If
a
man
does
go
into
a
business
,
he
ought
to
make
the
best
of
it
.
<EOS>
Of
course
,
it
was
a
poor
thing
after
the
diamonds
;
but
still
it
was
worth
having
.
<EOS>
There
is
some
story
about
a
Sir
Griffin
Tewett
.
<EOS>
He
's
a
real
Sir
Griffin
,
as
you
'll
find
by
the
peerage
.
<EOS>
He
was
to
marry
a
young
woman
,
and
our
Lord
George
insists
that
he
shall
marry
her
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
understand
all
about
it
,
but
the
girl
lives
in
the
same
house
with
Lady
Eustace
,
and
if
I
call
I
shall
find
out
.
<EOS>
They
say
that
Sir
Griffin
knows
all
about
the
necklace
,
and
threatens
to
tell
unless
he
is
let
off
marrying
.
<EOS>
I
rather
think
the
girl
is
Lord
George
's
daughter
,
so
that
there
is
a
thorough
complication
.
  
<EOS>
I
shall
go
down
to
Matching
on
Saturday
.
<EOS>
If
anything
turns
up
before
that
,
I
'll
write
again
,
or
send
a
message
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
whether
Plantagenet
will
be
able
to
leave
London
.
<EOS>
He
says
he
must
be
back
on
Monday
,
and
that
he
loses
too
much
time
on
the
road
.
<EOS>
Kiss
my
little
darlings
for
me
,
 
<EOS>
[
the
darlings
were
Lady
Glencora
's
children
,
and
the
duke
's
playthings
]
 
and
give
my
love
to
Madame
Max
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
you
do
n't
see
much
of
the
others
.
  
<EOS>
Most
affectionately
yours
,
  
GLENCORA
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
next
day
Lady
Glencora
actually
did
call
in
Hertford
Street
,
and
saw
our
friend
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
She
was
told
by
the
servant
that
Lady
Eustace
was
in
bed
;
but
,
with
her
usual
persistence
,
she
asked
questions
,
and
when
she
found
that
Lizzie
did
receive
visitors
in
her
room
,
she
sent
up
her
card
.
<EOS>
The
compliment
was
one
much
too
great
to
be
refused
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
stood
so
high
in
the
world
,
that
her
countenance
would
be
almost
as
valuable
as
another
lover
.
<EOS>
If
Lord
George
would
keep
her
secret
,
and
Lady
Glencora
would
be
her
friend
,
might
she
not
still
be
a
successful
woman
?
<EOS>
So
Lady
Glencora
Palliser
was
shown
up
to
Lizzie
's
chamber
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
was
found
with
her
nicest
nightcap
and
prettiest
handkerchief
,
with
a
volume
of
Tennyson
's
poetry
,
and
a
scent
-
bottle
.
<EOS>
She
knew
that
it
behoved
her
to
be
very
clever
at
this
interview
.
<EOS>
Her
instinct
told
her
that
her
first
greeting
should
show
more
of
surprise
than
of
gratification
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
in
a
pretty
,
feminine
,
almost
childish
way
,
she
was
very
much
surprised
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
doing
the
strangest
thing
in
the
world
,
I
know
,
Lady
Eustace
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
with
a
smile
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
sure
you
mean
to
do
a
kind
thing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
;
 
yes
,
I
do
.
<EOS>
I
think
we
have
not
met
since
you
were
at
my
house
near
the
end
of
last
season
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
in
London
six
weeks
,
but
have
not
been
out
much
.
<EOS>
For
the
last
fortnight
I
have
been
in
bed
.
<EOS>
I
have
had
things
to
trouble
me
so
much
that
they
have
made
me
ill
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
So
I
have
heard
,
Lady
Eustace
,
and
I
have
just
come
to
offer
you
my
sympathy
.
<EOS>
When
I
was
told
that
you
did
see
people
<EOS>
,
I
thought
that
perhaps
you
would
admit
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
So
willingly
,
Lady
Glencora
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
heard
,
of
course
,
of
your
terrible
losses
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
loss
has
been
as
nothing
to
the
vexation
that
has
accompanied
it
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
how
to
speak
of
it
.
<EOS>
Ladies
have
lost
their
jewels
before
now
,
but
I
do
n't
know
that
any
lady
before
me
has
ever
been
accused
of
stealing
them
herself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
has
been
no
accusation
,
surely
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
n't
exactly
been
put
in
prison
,
Lady
Glencora
,
but
I
have
had
policemen
here
wanting
to
search
my
things
;
 
and
<EOS>
then
you
know
yourself
what
reports
have
been
spread
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
yes
;
I
do
.
<EOS>
Only
for
that
,
to
tell
you
plainly
,
I
should
hardly
have
been
here
now
.
"
<EOS>
Then
Lady
Glencora
poured
out
her
sympathy
,
 
perhaps
with
more
eloquence
and
grace
than
discretion
.
<EOS>
She
was
,
at
any
rate
,
both
graceful
and
eloquent
.
"
<EOS>
As
for
the
loss
of
the
diamonds
,
I
think
you
bear
it
wonderfully
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
could
imagine
how
little
I
care
about
it
!
"
said
Lizzie
with
enthusiasm
.
<EOS>
"
They
had
lost
the
delight
which
I
used
to
feel
in
them
as
a
present
from
my
husband
.
<EOS>
People
had
talked
about
them
,
and
I
had
been
threatened
because
I
chose
to
keep
what
I
knew
to
be
my
own
.
<EOS>
Of
course
,
I
would
not
give
them
up
.
<EOS>
Would
you
have
given
them
up
,
Lady
Glencora
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Certainly
not
.
"
  
"
Nor
would
I.
But
when
once
all
that
had
begun
,
they
became
an
irrepressible
burthen
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
often
used
to
say
that
I
would
throw
them
into
the
sea
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
I
would
have
done
that
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
 
you
have
never
suffered
as
I
have
suffered
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
never
know
where
each
other
's
shoes
pinch
each
other
's
toes
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
never
been
left
desolate
.
<EOS>
You
have
a
husband
and
friends
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
husband
that
wants
to
put
five
farthings
into
a
penny
!
<EOS>
All
is
not
gold
that
glistens
,
Lady
Eustace
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
can
never
have
known
trials
such
as
mine
,
"
continued
Lizzie
,
not
understanding
in
the
least
her
new
friend
's
allusion
to
the
great
currency
question
.
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
you
may
have
heard
that
in
the
course
of
last
summer
I
became
engaged
to
marry
a
nobleman
,
with
whom
I
am
aware
that
you
are
acquainted
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
This
she
said
in
her
softest
whisper
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
yes
;
 
Lord
Fawn
.
<EOS>
I
know
him
very
well
.
<EOS>
Of
course
I
heard
of
it
.
<EOS>
We
all
heard
of
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
have
heard
how
he
has
treated
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
 
indeed
.
"
  
"
I
will
say
nothing
about
him
 
to
you
,
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
It
would
not
be
proper
that
I
should
do
so
.
<EOS>
But
all
that
came
of
this
wretched
necklace
.
<EOS>
After
that
,
can
you
wonder
that
I
should
say
that
I
wish
these
stones
had
been
thrown
into
the
sea
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
Lord
Fawn
will
 
will
come
all
right
again
now
?
"
said
Lady
Glencora
.
  
<EOS>
"
All
right
!
"
exclaimed
Lizzie
in
astonishment
.
  
<EOS>
"
His
objection
to
the
marriage
will
now
be
over
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
sure
I
do
not
in
the
least
know
what
are
his
lordship
's
views
,
"
said
Lizzie
in
scorn
,
"
and
,
to
tell
the
truth
,
I
do
not
very
much
care
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
I
mean
is
,
that
he
did
n't
like
you
to
have
the
Eustace
diamonds
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
They
were
not
Eustace
diamonds
.
<EOS>
They
were
my
diamonds
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
he
did
not
like
you
to
have
them
;
and
as
they
are
now
gone
 
for
ever
 
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
yes
;
 
they
are
gone
for
ever
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
His
objection
is
gone
too
.
<EOS>
Why
do
n't
you
write
to
him
,
and
make
him
come
and
see
you
?
<EOS>
That
's
what
I
should
do
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lizzie
,
of
course
,
repudiated
vehemently
any
idea
of
forcing
Lord
Fawn
into
a
marriage
which
had
become
distasteful
to
him
,
 
let
the
reason
be
what
it
might
.
<EOS>
"
His
lordship
is
perfectly
free
,
as
far
as
I
am
concerned
,
"
said
Lizzie
with
a
little
show
of
anger
.
<EOS>
But
all
this
Lady
Glencora
took
at
its
worth
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
Eustace
had
been
a
good
deal
knocked
about
,
and
Lady
Glencora
did
not
doubt
but
that
she
would
be
very
glad
to
get
back
her
betrothed
husband
.
<EOS>
The
little
woman
had
suffered
hardships
,
 
so
thought
Lady
Glencora
,
 
and
a
good
thing
would
be
done
by
bringing
her
into
fashion
,
and
setting
the
marriage
up
again
.
<EOS>
As
to
Lord
Fawn
,
 
the
fortune
was
there
,
as
good
now
as
it
had
been
when
he
first
sought
it
;
and
the
lady
was
very
pretty
,
a
baronet
's
widow
too
!
 
<EOS>
and
in
all
respects
good
enough
for
Lord
Fawn
.
<EOS>
A
very
pretty
little
baronet
's
widow
<EOS>
she
was
,
with
four
thousand
a
year
,
and
a
house
in
Scotland
,
and
a
history
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
determined
that
she
would
remake
the
match
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
you
know
,
friends
who
have
been
friends
should
be
brought
together
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
I
may
say
a
word
to
Lord
Fawn
?
"
  
<EOS>
Lizzie
hesitated
for
a
moment
before
she
answered
,
and
then
remembered
that
revenge
,
at
least
,
would
be
sweet
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
had
sworn
that
she
would
be
revenged
upon
Lord
Fawn
.
<EOS>
After
all
,
might
it
not
suit
her
best
to
carry
out
her
oath
by
marrying
him
?
<EOS>
But
whether
so
or
otherwise
,
it
would
not
but
be
well
for
her
that
he
should
be
again
at
her
feet
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
 
if
you
think
good
will
come
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
acquiescence
was
given
with
much
hesitation
;
 
but
the
circumstances
required
that
it
should
be
so
,
and
Lady
Glencora
fully
understood
the
circumstances
.
<EOS>
When
she
took
her
leave
,
Lizzie
was
profuse
in
her
gratitude
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
Lady
Glencora
,
it
has
been
so
good
of
you
to
come
.
<EOS>
Pray
come
again
,
if
you
can
spare
me
another
moment
.
"
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
said
that
she
would
come
again
.
  
<EOS>
During
the
visit
she
had
asked
some
question
concerning
Lucinda
and
Sir
Griffin
,
and
had
been
informed
that
that
marriage
was
to
go
on
.
<EOS>
A
hint
had
been
thrown
out
as
to
Lucinda
's
parentage
;
 
but
Lizzie
had
not
understood
the
hint
,
and
the
question
had
not
been
pressed
.
   
<EOS>
Quints
or
Semitenths
 
<EOS>
The
task
which
Lady
Glencora
had
taken
upon
herself
was
not
a
very
easy
one
.
<EOS>
No
doubt
Lord
Fawn
was
a
man
subservient
to
the
leaders
of
his
party
,
much
afraid
of
the
hard
judgment
of
those
with
whom
he
was
concerned
,
painfully
open
to
impression
from
what
he
would
have
called
public
opinion
,
to
a
certain
extent
a
coward
,
most
anxious
to
do
right
so
that
he
might
not
be
accused
of
being
in
the
wrong
,
 
and
at
the
same
time
gifted
with
but
little
of
that
insight
into
things
which
teaches
men
to
know
what
is
right
and
what
is
wrong
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
,
having
perceived
all
this
,
felt
that
he
was
a
man
upon
whom
a
few
words
from
her
might
have
an
effect
.
<EOS>
But
even
Lady
Glencora
might
hesitate
to
tell
a
gentleman
that
he
ought
to
marry
a
lady
,
when
the
gentleman
had
already
declared
his
intention
of
not
marrying
,
and
had
attempted
to
justify
his
decision
almost
publicly
by
a
reference
to
the
lady
's
conduct
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
almost
felt
that
she
had
undertaken
too
much
as
she
turned
over
in
her
mind
<EOS>
the
means
she
had
of
performing
her
promise
to
Lady
Eustace
.
  
<EOS>
The
five
-
farthing
bill
had
been
laid
upon
the
table
on
a
Tuesday
,
and
was
to
be
read
the
first
time
on
the
following
Monday
week
.
<EOS>
On
the
Wednesday
Lady
Glencora
had
written
to
the
duke
,
and
had
called
in
Hertford
Street
.
<EOS>
On
the
following
Sunday
she
was
at
Matching
,
looking
after
the
duke
;
 
but
she
returned
to
London
on
the
Tuesday
,
and
on
the
Wednesday
there
was
a
little
dinner
at
Mr.
Palliser
's
house
,
given
avowedly
with
the
object
of
further
friendly
discussion
respecting
the
new
Palliser
penny
.
<EOS>
The
prime
minister
was
to
be
there
,
and
Mr.
Bonteen
,
and
Barrington
Erle
,
and
those
special
members
of
the
Government
who
would
be
available
for
giving
special
help
to
the
financial
Hercules
of
the
day
.
<EOS>
A
question
,
perhaps
of
no
great
practical
importance
,
had
occurred
to
Mr.
Palliser
,
 
but
one
which
,
if
overlooked
,
might
be
fatal
to
the
ultimate
success
of
the
measure
.
<EOS>
There
is
so
much
in
a
name
,
 
and
then
an
ounce
of
ridicule
is
often
more
potent
than
a
hundredweight
of
argument
.
<EOS>
By
what
denomination
should
the
fifth
part
of
a
penny
be
hereafter
known
?
<EOS>
Some
one
had
,
ill
-
naturedly
,
whispered
to
Mr.
Palliser
that
a
farthing
meant
a
fourth
,
and
at
once
there
arose
a
new
trouble
,
which
for
a
time
bore
very
heavily
on
him
.
<EOS>
Should
he
boldly
disregard
the
original
meaning
of
the
useful
old
word
;
or
should
he
venture
on
the
dangers
of
new
nomenclature
?
<EOS>
October
,
as
he
said
to
himself
,
is
still
the
tenth
month
of
the
year
,
November
the
eleventh
,
and
so
on
,
though
by
these
names
they
are
so
plainly
called
the
eighth
and
ninth
.
<EOS>
All
France
tried
to
rid
itself
of
this
absurdity
,
and
failed
.
<EOS>
Should
he
stick
by
the
farthing
;
or
should
he
call
it
a
fifthing
,
a
quint
,
or
a
semitenth
?
<EOS>
"
There
's
the
"
Fortnightly
Review
"
comes
out
but
once
a
month
,
"
he
said
to
his
friend
Mr.
Bonteen
,
"
and
I
'm
told
that
it
does
very
well
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Bonteen
,
who
was
a
rational
man
,
thought
the
"
Review
"
would
do
better
if
it
were
called
by
a
more
rational
name
,
and
was
very
much
in
favour
of
"
a
quint
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Gresham
had
expressed
an
opinion
,
somewhat
off
-
hand
,
that
English
people
would
never
be
got
to
talk
about
quints
,
and
so
there
was
a
difficulty
.
<EOS>
A
little
dinner
was
therefore
arranged
,
and
Mr.
Palliser
,
as
was
his
custom
in
such
matters
,
put
the
affair
of
the
dinner
into
his
wife
's
hands
.
<EOS>
When
he
was
told
that
she
had
included
Lord
Fawn
among
the
guests
he
opened
his
eyes
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
,
who
might
be
good
enough
at
the
India
Office
,
knew
literally
nothing
about
the
penny
.
"
<EOS>
He
'll
take
it
as
the
greatest
compliment
in
the
world
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
want
to
pay
Lord
Fawn
a
compliment
,
"
said
Mr.
Palliser
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
do
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
And
so
the
matter
was
arranged
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
very
nice
little
dinner
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Gresham
and
Mrs.
Bonteen
were
there
,
and
the
great
question
of
the
day
was
settled
in
two
minutes
,
before
the
guests
went
out
of
the
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
"
Stick
to
your
farthing
,
"
said
Mr.
Gresham
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
so
,
"
said
Mr.
Palliser
.
  
<EOS>
"
Quint
's
a
very
easy
word
,
"
said
Mr.
Bonteen
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
squint
is
an
easier
,
"
said
Mr.
Gresham
,
with
all
a
prime
minister
's
jocose
authority
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
'd
certainly
be
called
cock
-
eyes
,
"
said
Barrington
Erle
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
nothing
of
the
sound
of
a
quarter
in
farthing
,
"
said
Mr.
Palliser
.
  
<EOS>
"
Stick
to
the
old
word
,
"
said
Mr.
Gresham
.
<EOS>
And
so
the
matter
was
decided
while
Lady
Glencora
was
flattering
Lord
Fawn
as
to
the
manner
in
which
he
had
finally
arranged
the
affair
of
the
Sawab
of
Mygawb
.
<EOS>
Then
they
went
down
to
dinner
,
and
not
a
word
more
was
said
that
evening
about
the
new
penny
by
Mr.
Palliser
.
  
<EOS>
Before
dinner
Lady
Glencora
had
exacted
a
promise
from
Lord
Fawn
that
he
would
return
to
the
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
was
very
clever
at
such
work
,
and
said
nothing
then
of
her
purpose
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
want
her
guests
to
run
away
,
and
therefore
Lord
Fawn
,
 
Lord
Fawn
especially
,
 
must
stay
.
<EOS>
If
he
were
to
go
there
would
be
nothing
spoken
of
all
the
evening
,
but
that
weary
new
penny
.
<EOS>
To
oblige
her
he
must
remain
;
 
and
,
of
course
,
he
did
remain
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Whom
do
you
think
I
saw
the
other
day
?
"
said
Lady
Glencora
,
when
she
got
her
victim
into
a
corner
.
<EOS>
Of
course
,
Lord
Fawn
had
no
idea
whom
she
might
have
seen
.
<EOS>
Up
to
that
moment
no
suspicion
of
what
was
coming
upon
him
had
crossed
his
mind
.
<EOS>
"
I
called
upon
poor
Lady
Eustace
,
and
found
her
in
bed
.
<EOS>
"
Then
did
Lord
Fawn
blush
up
to
the
roots
of
his
hair
,
and
for
a
moment
he
was
stricken
dumb
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
feel
for
her
so
much
!
<EOS>
I
think
she
has
been
so
hardly
used
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
was
obliged
to
say
something
.
<EOS>
"
My
name
has
,
of
course
,
been
much
mixed
up
with
hers
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Lord
Fawn
,
I
know
it
has
.
<EOS>
And
it
is
because
I
am
so
sure
of
your
high
-
minded
generosity
and
 
and
thorough
devotion
,
that
I
have
ventured
to
speak
to
you
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
there
is
nothing
you
would
wish
so
much
as
to
get
at
the
truth
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Certainly
,
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
All
manner
of
stories
have
been
told
about
her
,
and
,
as
I
believe
,
without
the
slightest
foundation
.
<EOS>
They
tell
me
now
that
she
had
an
undoubted
right
to
keep
the
diamonds
;
 
that
even
if
Sir
Florian
did
not
give
them
to
her
,
they
were
hers
under
his
will
.
<EOS>
Those
lawyers
have
given
up
all
idea
of
proceeding
against
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Because
the
necklace
has
been
stolen
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Altogether
independently
of
that
.
<EOS>
Do
you
see
Mr.
Eustace
,
and
ask
him
if
what
I
say
is
not
true
.
<EOS>
If
it
had
not
been
her
own
she
would
have
been
responsible
for
the
value
,
even
though
it
were
stolen
;
and
with
such
a
fortune
as
hers
they
would
never
have
allowed
her
to
escape
.
<EOS>
They
were
as
bitter
against
her
as
they
could
be
;
 
were
n't
they
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Camperdown
thought
that
the
property
should
be
given
up
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
yes
;
 
that
's
the
man
's
name
;
a
horrid
man
.
<EOS>
I
am
told
that
he
was
really
most
cruel
to
her
.
<EOS>
And
then
,
because
a
lot
of
thieves
had
got
about
her
,
 
after
the
diamonds
,
you
know
,
like
flies
round
a
honey
-
pot
,
 
and
took
first
her
necklace
and
then
her
money
,
they
were
impudent
enough
to
say
that
she
had
stolen
her
own
things
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
they
quite
said
that
,
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Something
very
much
like
it
,
Lord
Fawn
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
doubt
in
my
own
mind
who
did
steal
all
the
things
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Who
was
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
 
one
must
n't
mention
names
in
such
an
affair
without
evidence
.
<EOS>
At
any
rate
,
she
has
been
very
badly
treated
,
and
I
shall
take
her
up
.
<EOS>
If
I
were
you
I
would
go
and
call
upon
her
;
 
I
would
indeed
.
<EOS>
I
think
you
owe
it
to
her
.
<EOS>
Well
,
duke
,
what
do
you
think
of
Plantagenet
's
penny
now
?
<EOS>
Will
it
ever
be
worth
two
halfpence
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
This
question
was
asked
of
the
Duke
of
St.
Bungay
,
a
great
nobleman
whom
all
Liberals
loved
,
and
a
member
of
the
Cabinet
.
<EOS>
He
had
come
in
since
dinner
,
and
had
been
asking
a
question
or
two
as
to
what
had
been
decided
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
yes
;
if
properly
invested
I
think
it
will
.
<EOS>
I
'm
glad
that
it
is
not
to
contain
five
semitenths
.
<EOS>
A
semitenth
would
never
have
been
a
popular
form
of
money
in
England
.
<EOS>
We
hate
new
names
so
much
that
we
have
not
yet
got
beyond
talking
of
fourpenny
bits
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
a
great
deal
in
a
name
;
 
is
n't
there
?
<EOS>
You
do
n't
think
they
'll
call
them
Pallisers
,
or
Palls
,
or
anything
of
that
sort
;
 
do
you
?
<EOS>
I
should
n't
like
to
hear
that
under
the
new
régime
two
lollypops
were
to
cost
three
Palls
.
<EOS>
But
they
say
it
never
can
be
carried
this
session
,
 
and
we
sha'n't
be
in
,
in
the
next
year
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Who
says
so
?
<EOS>
Do
n't
be
such
a
prophetess
of
evil
,
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
I
mean
to
be
in
for
the
next
three
sessions
,
and
I
mean
to
see
Palliser
's
measure
carried
through
the
House
of
Lords
next
session
.
<EOS>
I
shall
be
paying
for
my
mutton
-
chops
at
the
club
at
so
many
quints
a
chop
yet
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
think
so
,
Fawn
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
what
to
think
,
"
said
Lord
Fawn
,
whose
mind
was
intent
on
other
matters
.
<EOS>
After
that
he
left
the
room
as
quickly
as
he
could
,
and
escaped
out
into
the
street
.
<EOS>
His
mind
was
very
much
disturbed
.
<EOS>
If
Lady
Glencora
was
determined
to
take
up
the
cudgels
for
the
woman
he
had
rejected
,
the
comfort
and
peace
of
his
life
would
be
over
.
<EOS>
He
knew
well
enough
how
strong
was
Lady
Glencora
.
   
<EOS>
Job
's
Comforters
 
Mrs.
Carbuncle
and
Lady
Eustace
had
now
been
up
in
town
between
six
and
seven
weeks
,
and
the
record
of
their
doings
has
necessarily
dealt
chiefly
with
robberies
and
the
rumours
of
robberies
.
<EOS>
But
at
intervals
the
minds
of
the
two
ladies
had
been
intent
on
other
things
.
<EOS>
The
former
was
still
intent
on
marrying
her
niece
,
Lucinda
Roanoke
,
to
Sir
Griffin
,
and
the
latter
had
never
for
a
moment
forgotten
the
imperative
duty
which
lay
upon
her
of
revenging
herself
upon
Lord
Fawn
.
<EOS>
The
match
between
Sir
Griffin
and
Lucinda
was
still
to
be
a
match
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
persevered
in
the
teeth
both
of
the
gentleman
and
of
the
lady
,
and
still
promised
herself
success
.
<EOS>
And
our
Lizzie
,
in
the
midst
of
all
her
troubles
,
had
not
been
idle
.
<EOS>
In
doing
her
justice
we
must
acknowledge
that
she
had
almost
abandoned
the
hope
of
becoming
Lady
Fawn
.
<EOS>
Other
hopes
and
other
ambitions
had
come
upon
her
.
<EOS>
Latterly
the
Corsair
had
been
all
in
all
to
her
,
 
with
exceptional
moments
in
which
she
told
herself
that
her
heart
belonged
exclusively
to
her
cousin
Frank
.
<EOS>
But
Lord
Fawn
's
offences
were
not
to
be
forgotten
,
and
she
continually
urged
upon
her
cousin
the
depth
of
the
wrongs
which
she
had
suffered
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
part
of
Frank
Greystock
there
was
certainly
no
desire
to
let
the
Under
-
Secretary
escape
.
<EOS>
It
is
hoped
that
the
reader
,
to
whom
every
tittle
of
this
story
has
been
told
without
reserve
,
and
every
secret
unfolded
,
will
remember
that
others
were
not
treated
with
so
much
open
candour
.
<EOS>
The
reader
knows
much
more
of
Lizzie
Eustace
than
did
her
cousin
Frank
.
<EOS>
He
,
indeed
,
was
not
quite
in
love
with
Lizzie
;
but
to
him
she
was
a
pretty
,
graceful
young
woman
,
to
whom
he
was
bound
by
many
ties
,
and
who
had
been
cruelly
injured
.
<EOS>
Dangerous
she
was
doubtless
,
and
perhaps
a
little
artificial
.
<EOS>
To
have
had
her
married
to
Lord
Fawn
would
have
been
a
good
thing
,
 
and
would
still
be
a
good
thing
.
<EOS>
According
to
all
the
rules
known
in
such
matters
Lord
Fawn
was
bound
to
marry
her
.
<EOS>
He
had
become
engaged
to
her
,
and
Lizzie
had
done
nothing
to
forfeit
her
engagement
.
<EOS>
As
to
the
necklace
,
 
the
plea
made
for
jilting
her
on
that
ground
was
a
disgraceful
pretext
.
<EOS>
Everybody
was
beginning
to
perceive
that
Mr.
Camperdown
would
never
have
succeeded
in
getting
the
diamonds
from
her
,
even
if
they
had
not
been
stolen
.
<EOS>
It
was
"
preposterous
,
"
as
Frank
said
over
and
over
again
to
his
friend
Herriot
,
that
a
man
when
he
was
engaged
to
a
lady
,
should
take
upon
himself
to
judge
her
conduct
as
Lord
Fawn
had
done
,
 
and
then
ride
out
of
his
engagement
on
a
verdict
found
by
himself
.
<EOS>
Frank
had
therefore
willingly
displayed
alacrity
in
persecuting
his
lordship
,
and
had
not
been
altogether
without
hope
that
he
might
drive
the
two
into
a
marriage
yet
,
 
in
spite
of
the
protestations
made
by
Lizzie
at
Portray
.
  
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
had
certainly
not
spent
a
happy
winter
.
<EOS>
Between
Mrs.
Hittaway
on
one
side
and
Frank
Greystock
on
the
other
,
his
life
had
been
a
burthen
to
him
.
<EOS>
It
had
been
suggested
to
him
by
various
people
that
he
was
behaving
badly
to
the
lady
,
 
who
was
represented
as
having
been
cruelly
misused
by
fortune
and
by
himself
.
<EOS>
On
the
other
hand
it
had
been
hinted
to
him
,
that
nothing
was
too
bad
to
believe
of
Lizzie
Eustace
,
and
that
no
calamity
could
be
so
great
as
<EOS>
that
by
which
he
would
be
overwhelmed
were
he
still
to
allow
himself
to
be
forced
into
that
marriage
.
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
better
,
"
Mrs.
Hittaway
had
said
,
"
to
retire
to
Ireland
at
once
,
and
cultivate
your
demesne
in
Tipperary
.
<EOS>
"
This
was
a
grievous
sentence
,
and
one
which
had
greatly
excited
the
brother
's
wrath
;
 
but
it
had
shown
how
very
strong
was
his
sister
's
opinion
against
the
lady
to
whom
he
had
unfortunately
offered
his
hand
.
<EOS>
Then
there
came
to
him
a
letter
from
Mr.
Greystock
,
in
which
he
was
asked
for
his
"
written
explanation
.
<EOS>
"
If
there
be
a
proceeding
which
an
official
man
dislikes
worse
than
another
,
it
is
a
demand
for
a
written
explanation
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
impossible
,
"
Frank
had
said
,
"
that
your
conduct
to
my
cousin
should
be
allowed
to
drop
without
further
notice
.
<EOS>
Hers
has
been
without
reproach
.
<EOS>
Your
engagement
with
her
has
been
made
public
,
 
chiefly
by
you
,
and
it
is
out
of
the
question
that
she
should
be
treated
as
you
are
treating
her
,
and
that
your
lordship
should
escape
without
punishment
.
<EOS>
"
What
the
punishment
was
to
be
he
did
not
say
;
but
there
did
come
a
punishment
on
Lord
Fawn
from
the
eyes
of
every
man
whose
eyes
met
his
own
,
and
in
the
tones
of
every
voice
that
addressed
him
.
<EOS>
The
looks
of
the
very
clerks
in
the
India
Office
accused
him
of
behaving
badly
to
a
young
woman
,
and
the
doorkeeper
at
the
House
of
Lords
seemed
to
glance
askance
at
him
.
<EOS>
And
now
Lady
Glencora
,
who
was
the
social
leader
of
his
own
party
,
the
feminine
pole
-
star
of
the
Liberal
heavens
,
the
most
popular
and
the
most
daring
woman
in
London
,
had
attacked
him
personally
,
and
told
him
that
he
ought
to
call
on
Lady
Eustace
!
  
<EOS>
Let
it
not
for
a
moment
be
supposed
that
Lord
Fawn
was
without
conscience
in
the
matter
,
or
indifferent
to
moral
obligations
.
<EOS>
There
was
not
a
man
in
London
less
willing
to
behave
badly
to
a
young
woman
than
Lord
Fawn
;
or
one
who
would
more
diligently
struggle
to
get
back
to
the
right
path
,
if
convinced
that
he
was
astray
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
one
who
detested
interference
in
his
private
matters
,
and
who
was
nearly
driven
mad
between
his
sister
and
Frank
Greystock
.
<EOS>
When
he
left
Lady
Glencora
's
house
he
walked
towards
his
own
abode
with
a
dark
cloud
upon
his
brow
.
<EOS>
He
was
at
first
very
angry
with
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
Even
her
position
gave
her
no
right
to
meddle
with
his
most
private
affairs
as
she
had
done
.
<EOS>
He
would
resent
it
,
and
would
quarrel
with
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
What
right
could
she
have
to
advise
him
to
call
upon
any
woman
?
<EOS>
But
by
degrees
this
wrath
died
away
,
and
gave
place
to
fears
,
and
qualms
,
and
inward
questions
.
<EOS>
He
,
too
,
had
found
a
change
in
general
opinion
about
the
diamonds
.
<EOS>
When
he
had
taken
upon
himself
with
a
high
hand
to
dissolve
his
own
engagement
,
everybody
had
,
as
he
thought
,
acknowledged
that
Lizzie
Eustace
was
keeping
property
which
did
not
belong
to
her
.
<EOS>
Now
people
talked
of
her
losses
as
though
the
diamonds
had
been
undoubtedly
her
own
.
<EOS>
On
the
next
morning
Lord
Fawn
took
an
opportunity
of
seeing
Mr.
Camperdown
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
lord
,
"
said
Mr.
Camperdown
,
"
I
shall
wash
my
hands
of
the
matter
altogether
.
<EOS>
The
diamonds
are
gone
,
and
the
questions
now
are
,
who
stole
them
,
and
where
are
they
?
<EOS>
In
our
business
we
ca
n't
meddle
with
such
questions
as
those
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
drop
the
bill
in
Chancery
then
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
good
can
the
bill
do
us
when
the
diamonds
are
gone
?
<EOS>
If
Lady
Eustace
had
anything
to
do
with
the
robbery
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
You
suspect
her
,
then
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
No
,
my
lord
;
no
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
say
that
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
right
to
say
that
.
<EOS>
Indeed
it
is
not
Lady
Eustace
that
I
suspect
.
<EOS>
She
has
got
into
bad
hands
,
perhaps
;
but
I
do
not
think
that
she
is
a
thief
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
were
suggesting
that
,
 
if
she
had
anything
to
do
with
the
robbery
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
Well
;
 
yes
;
 
if
she
had
,
it
would
not
be
for
us
to
take
steps
against
her
in
the
matter
.
<EOS>
In
fact
,
the
trustees
have
decided
that
they
will
do
nothing
more
,
and
my
hands
are
tied
.
<EOS>
If
the
minor
,
when
he
comes
of
age
,
claims
the
property
from
them
,
they
will
prefer
to
replace
it
.
<EOS>
It
is
n't
very
likely
;
but
that
's
what
they
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
But
if
it
was
an
heirloom
 
"
suggested
Lord
Fawn
,
going
back
to
the
old
claim
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
exploded
,
"
said
Mr.
Camperdown
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Dove
was
quite
clear
about
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
This
was
the
end
of
the
filing
of
that
bill
in
Chancery
as
to
which
Mr.
Camperdown
had
been
so
very
enthusiastic
!
<EOS>
Now
it
certainly
was
the
case
that
poor
Lord
Fawn
in
his
conduct
towards
Lizzie
had
trusted
greatly
to
the
support
of
Mr.
Camperdown
's
legal
proceeding
.
<EOS>
The
world
could
hardly
have
expected
him
to
marry
a
woman
against
whom
a
bill
in
Chancery
was
being
carried
on
for
the
recovery
of
diamonds
which
did
not
belong
to
her
.
<EOS>
But
that
support
was
now
altogether
withdrawn
from
him
.
<EOS>
It
was
acknowledged
that
the
necklace
was
not
an
heirloom
,
 
clearly
acknowledged
by
Mr.
Camperdown
!
<EOS>
And
even
Mr.
Camperdown
would
not
express
an
opinion
that
the
lady
had
stolen
her
own
diamonds
.
  
<EOS>
How
would
it
go
with
him
,
if
after
all
,
he
were
to
marry
her
?
<EOS>
The
bone
of
contention
between
them
had
at
any
rate
been
made
to
vanish
.
<EOS>
The
income
was
still
there
,
and
Lady
Glencora
Palliser
had
all
but
promised
her
friendship
.
<EOS>
As
he
entered
the
India
Office
on
his
return
from
Mr.
Camperdown
's
chambers
,
he
almost
thought
that
that
would
be
the
best
way
out
of
his
difficulty
.
<EOS>
In
his
room
he
found
his
brother
-
in
-
law
,
Mr.
Hittaway
,
waiting
for
him
.
<EOS>
It
is
always
necessary
that
a
man
should
have
some
friend
whom
he
can
trust
in
delicate
affairs
,
and
Mr.
Hittaway
was
selected
as
Lord
Fawn
's
friend
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
at
all
points
the
man
whom
Lord
Fawn
would
have
chosen
,
but
for
their
close
connexion
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Hittaway
was
talkative
,
perhaps
a
little
loud
,
and
too
apt
to
make
capital
out
of
every
incident
of
his
life
.
<EOS>
But
confidential
friends
are
not
easily
found
,
and
one
does
not
wish
to
increase
the
circle
to
whom
one
's
family
secrets
must
become
known
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Hittaway
was
at
any
rate
zealous
for
the
Fawn
family
,
and
then
his
character
as
an
official
man
stood
high
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
asked
on
the
previous
evening
to
step
across
from
the
Civil
Appeal
Office
to
give
his
opinion
respecting
that
letter
from
Frank
Greystock
demanding
a
written
explanation
.
<EOS>
The
letter
had
been
sent
to
him
;
and
Mr.
Hittaway
had
carried
it
home
and
shown
it
to
his
wife
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
's
a
cantankerous
Tory
,
and
determined
to
make
himself
disagreeable
,
"
said
Mr.
Hittaway
,
taking
the
letter
from
his
pocket
and
beginning
the
conversation
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
seated
himself
in
his
great
arm
-
chair
,
and
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
disposed
,
after
much
consideration
,
to
advise
you
to
take
no
notice
of
the
letter
,
"
said
Mr.
Hittaway
,
giving
his
counsel
in
accordance
with
instructions
received
from
his
wife
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
still
buried
his
face
.
<EOS>
"
Of
course
the
thing
is
painful
,
 
very
painful
.
<EOS>
But
out
of
two
evils
one
should
choose
the
least
.
<EOS>
The
writer
of
this
letter
is
altogether
unable
to
carry
out
his
threat
.
"
<EOS>
"
What
can
the
man
do
to
him
?
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Hittaway
had
asked
,
almost
snapping
at
her
husband
as
she
did
so
.
"
<EOS>
And
then
,
"
continued
Mr.
Hittaway
,
"
we
all
know
that
public
opinion
is
with
you
altogether
.
<EOS>
The
conduct
of
Lady
Eustace
is
notorious
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Everybody
is
taking
her
part
,
"
said
Lord
Fawn
,
almost
crying
.
  
<EOS>
"
Surely
not
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
 
they
are
.
<EOS>
The
bill
in
Chancery
has
been
withdrawn
,
and
it
's
my
belief
that
if
the
necklace
were
found
to
-
morrow
,
there
would
be
nothing
to
prevent
her
keeping
it
,
 
just
as
she
did
before
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
it
was
an
heirloom
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
it
was
n't
.
<EOS>
The
lawyers
were
all
wrong
about
it
.
<EOS>
As
far
as
I
can
see
,
lawyers
always
are
wrong
.
<EOS>
About
those
nine
lacs
of
rupees
for
the
Sawab
,
Finlay
was
all
wrong
.
<EOS>
Camperdown
owns
that
he
was
wrong
.
<EOS>
If
,
after
all
,
the
diamonds
were
hers
,
I
'm
sure
I
do
n't
know
what
I
am
to
do
.
<EOS>
Thank
you
,
Hittaway
,
for
coming
over
.
<EOS>
That
'll
do
for
the
present
.
<EOS>
Just
leave
that
ruffian
's
letter
,
and
I
'll
think
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
was
considered
by
Mrs.
Hittaway
to
be
a
very
bad
state
of
things
,
and
there
was
great
consternation
in
Warwick
Square
when
Mr.
Hittaway
told
his
wife
this
new
story
of
her
brother
's
weakness
.
<EOS>
She
was
not
going
to
be
weak
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
intend
to
withdraw
her
opposition
to
the
marriage
.
<EOS>
She
was
not
going
to
be
frightened
by
Lizzie
Eustace
and
Frank
Greystock
,
 
knowing
as
she
did
that
they
were
lovers
,
and
very
improper
lovers
,
too
.
<EOS>
"
Of
course
she
stole
them
herself
,
"
said
Mrs.
Hittaway
;
"
<EOS>
and
I
do
n't
doubt
<EOS>
but
she
stole
her
own
money
afterwards
.
<EOS>
There
's
nothing
she
would
n't
do
.
<EOS>
I
'd
sooner
see
Frederic
in
his
grave
than
married
to
such
a
woman
as
that
.
<EOS>
Men
do
n't
know
how
sly
women
can
be
;
 
that
's
the
truth
.
<EOS>
And
Frederic
has
been
so
spoilt
among
them
down
at
Richmond
,
that
he
has
no
real
judgment
left
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
suppose
he
means
to
marry
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Upon
my
word
I
do
n't
know
,
"
said
Mr.
Hittaway
.
<EOS>
Then
Mrs.
Hittaway
made
up
her
mind
that
she
would
at
once
write
a
letter
to
Scotland
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
an
old
lord
about
London
in
those
days
,
 
or
,
rather
,
one
who
was
an
old
Liberal
but
a
young
lord
,
 
one
Lord
Mount
Thistle
,
who
had
sat
in
the
Cabinet
,
and
had
lately
been
made
a
peer
when
his
place
in
the
Cabinet
was
wanted
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
pompous
,
would
-
be
important
,
silly
old
man
,
well
acquainted
with
all
the
traditions
of
his
party
,
and
perhaps
,
on
that
account
,
useful
,
 
but
a
bore
,
and
very
apt
to
meddle
when
he
was
not
wanted
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
,
on
the
day
after
her
dinner
-
party
,
whispered
into
his
ear
that
Lord
Fawn
was
getting
himself
into
trouble
,
and
that
a
few
words
of
caution
,
coming
to
him
from
one
whom
he
respected
so
much
as
he
did
Lord
Mount
Thistle
,
would
be
of
service
to
him
.
<EOS>
Lord
Mount
Thistle
had
known
Lord
Fawn
's
father
,
and
declared
himself
at
once
to
be
quite
entitled
to
interfere
.
"
<EOS>
He
is
really
behaving
badly
to
Lady
Eustace
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
,
"
and
I
do
n't
think
that
he
knows
it
.
"
<EOS>
Lord
Mount
Thistle
,
proud
of
a
commission
from
the
hands
of
Lady
Glencora
,
went
almost
at
once
to
his
old
friend
's
son
.
<EOS>
He
found
him
at
the
House
that
night
,
and
whispered
his
few
words
of
caution
in
one
of
the
lobbies
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
you
will
excuse
me
,
Fawn
,
"
Lord
Mount
Thistle
said
,
"
but
people
seem
to
think
that
you
are
not
behaving
quite
well
to
Lady
Eustace
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
people
?
"
demanded
Lord
Fawn
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
fellow
,
that
is
a
question
that
can
not
be
answered
.
<EOS>
You
know
that
I
am
the
last
man
to
interfere
if
I
did
n't
think
it
my
duty
as
a
friend
.
<EOS>
You
were
engaged
to
her
?
"
 
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
only
frowned
.
<EOS>
"
If
so
,
"
continued
the
late
cabinet
minister
,
"
and
if
you
have
broken
it
off
,
you
ought
to
give
your
reasons
.
<EOS>
She
has
a
right
to
demand
as
much
as
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
On
the
next
morning
,
Friday
,
there
came
to
him
the
note
which
Lady
Glencora
had
recommended
Lizzie
to
write
.
<EOS>
It
was
very
short
.
"
<EOS>
Had
you
not
better
come
and
see
me
?
<EOS>
You
can
hardly
think
that
things
should
be
left
as
they
are
now
.
<EOS>
L.
E.
 
<EOS>
Hertford
Street
,
Thursday
.
<EOS>
"
He
had
hoped
,
 
he
had
ventured
to
hope
,
 
that
things
might
be
left
,
and
that
they
would
arrange
themselves
;
that
he
could
throw
aside
his
engagement
without
further
trouble
,
and
that
the
subject
would
drop
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
not
so
.
<EOS>
His
enemy
,
Frank
Greystock
,
had
demanded
from
him
a
"
written
explanation
"
of
his
conduct
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Camperdown
had
deserted
him
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
Palliser
,
with
whom
he
had
not
the
honour
of
any
intimate
acquaintance
,
had
taken
upon
herself
to
give
him
advice
.
<EOS>
Lord
Mount
Thistle
had
found
fault
with
him
.
<EOS>
And
now
there
had
come
a
note
from
Lizzie
Eustace
herself
,
which
he
could
hardly
venture
to
leave
altogether
unnoticed
.
<EOS>
On
that
Friday
he
dined
at
his
club
,
and
then
went
to
his
sister
's
house
in
Warwick
Square
.
<EOS>
If
assistance
might
be
had
anywhere
,
it
would
be
from
his
sister
;
 
she
,
at
any
rate
,
would
not
want
courage
in
carrying
on
the
battle
on
his
behalf
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ill
-
used
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
as
soon
as
they
were
closeted
together
.
<EOS>
"
Who
dares
to
say
so
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
That
old
fool
,
Mount
Thistle
,
has
been
with
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
,
Frederic
,
you
do
n't
mind
what
such
a
man
as
that
says
.
<EOS>
He
has
probably
been
prompted
by
some
friend
of
hers
.
<EOS>
And
who
else
?
"
  
"
Camperdown
turns
round
now
and
says
that
they
do
n't
mean
to
do
anything
more
about
the
necklace
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
Palliser
told
me
the
other
day
that
all
the
world
believes
that
the
thing
was
her
own

<EOS>
"
What
does
Lady
Glencora
Palliser
know
about
it
?
<EOS>
If
Lady
Glencora
Palliser
would
mind
her
own
affairs
it
would
be
much
better
for
her
.
<EOS>
I
remember
when
she
had
troubles
enough
of
her
own
,
without
meddling
with
other
people
's
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
now
I
've
got
this
note
.
"
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
had
already
shown
Lizzie
's
few
scrawled
words
to
his
sister
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
must
go
and
see
her
.
"
  
"
Do
no
such
thing
,
Frederic
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
not
?
<EOS>
I
must
answer
it
,
and
what
can
I
say
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
go
there
,
that
woman
will
be
your
wife
,
and
you
'll
never
have
a
happy
day
again
as
long
as
you
live
.
<EOS>
The
match
is
broken
off
,
and
she
knows
it
.
<EOS>
I
should
n't
take
the
slightest
notice
of
her
,
or
of
her
cousin
,
or
of
any
of
them
.
<EOS>
If
she
chooses
to
bring
an
action
against
you
,
that
is
another
thing
.
<EOS>
"
  
Lord
Fawn
paused
for
a
few
moments
before
he
answered
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
ought
to
go
,
"
he
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
am
sure
that
you
ought
not
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
only
about
the
diamonds
,
 
though
that
was
quite
enough
to
break
off
any
engagement
.
<EOS>
Have
you
forgotten
what
I
told
you
that
the
man
saw
at
Portray
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
that
the
man
spoke
the
truth
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
he
did
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
hate
that
kind
of
espionage
.
<EOS>
It
is
so
very
likely
that
mistakes
should
be
made
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
When
she
was
sitting
in
his
arms
,
 
and
kissing
him
!
<EOS>
If
you
choose
to
do
it
,
Frederic
,
of
course
you
must
.
<EOS>
We
ca
n't
prevent
it
.
<EOS>
You
are
free
to
marry
any
one
you
please
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
not
talking
of
marrying
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
suppose
she
wants
you
to
go
there
for
?
<EOS>
As
for
political
life
,
I
am
quite
sure
it
would
be
the
death
of
you
.
<EOS>
If
I
were
you
I
would
n't
go
near
her
.
<EOS>
You
have
got
out
of
the
scrape
,
and
I
would
remain
out
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
have
n't
got
out
,
"
said
Lord
Fawn
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
next
day
,
Saturday
,
he
did
nothing
in
the
matter
.
<EOS>
He
went
down
,
as
was
his
custom
,
to
Richmond
,
and
did
not
once
mention
Lizzie
's
name
.
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
and
her
daughters
never
spoke
of
her
now
,
 
neither
of
her
,
nor
,
in
his
presence
,
of
poor
Lucy
Morris
.
<EOS>
But
on
his
return
to
London
on
the
Sunday
evening
he
found
another
note
from
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
hardly
have
the
hardihood
to
leave
my
note
unanswered
.
<EOS>
Pray
let
me
know
when
you
will
come
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Some
answer
must
,
as
he
felt
,
be
made
to
her
.
<EOS>
For
a
moment
he
thought
of
asking
his
mother
to
call
;
 
but
he
at
once
saw
that
by
doing
so
he
might
lay
himself
open
to
terrible
ridicule
.
<EOS>
Could
he
induce
Lord
Mount
Thistle
to
be
his
Mercury
?
<EOS>
It
would
,
he
felt
,
be
quite
impossible
to
make
Lord
Mount
Thistle
understand
all
the
facts
of
his
position
.
<EOS>
His
sister
,
Mrs.
Hittaway
,
might
have
gone
,
were
it
not
that
she
herself
was
violently
opposed
to
any
visit
.
<EOS>
The
more
he
thought
of
it
the
more
convinced
he
became
that
,
should
it
be
known
that
he
had
received
two
such
notes
from
a
lady
and
that
he
had
not
answered
or
noticed
them
,
the
world
would
judge
him
to
have
behaved
badly
.
<EOS>
So
,
at
last
,
he
wrote
,
 
on
that
Sunday
evening
,
 
fixing
a
somewhat
distant
day
for
his
visit
to
Hertford
Street
.
<EOS>
His
note
was
as
follows
:
    
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
presents
his
compliments
to
Lady
Eustace
.
<EOS>
In
accordance
with
the
wish
expressed
in
Lady
Eustace
's
two
notes
of
the
23rd
instant
and
this
date
,
Lord
Fawn
will
do
himself
the
honour
of
waiting
upon
Lady
Eustace
on
Saturday
next
,
March
3rd
,
at
12
,
noon
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
had
thought
that
under
circumstances
as
they
now
exist
,
no
further
personal
interview
could
lead
to
the
happiness
of
either
party
;
but
as
Lady
Eustace
thinks
otherwise
,
he
feels
himself
constrained
to
comply
with
her
desire
.
  
<EOS>
Sunday
evening
,
25
February
,
18
 
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
going
to
see
her
in
the
course
of
this
week
,
"
he
said
,
in
answer
to
a
further
question
from
Lady
Glencora
,
who
,
chancing
to
meet
him
in
society
,
had
again
addressed
him
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
He
lacked
the
courage
to
tell
Lady
Glencora
to
mind
her
own
business
and
to
allow
him
to
do
the
same
.
<EOS>
Had
she
been
a
little
less
great
than
she
was
,
 
either
as
regarded
herself
or
her
husband
,
 
he
would
have
done
so
.
<EOS>
But
Lady
Glencora
was
the
social
queen
of
the
party
to
which
he
belonged
,
and
Mr.
Palliser
was
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
,
and
would
some
day
be
Duke
of
Omnium
.
  
<EOS>
"
As
you
are
great
,
be
merciful
,
Lord
Fawn
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
"
You
men
,
I
believe
,
never
realise
what
it
is
that
women
feel
when
they
love
.
<EOS>
It
is
my
belief
that
she
will
die
unless
you
are
re
-
united
to
her
.
<EOS>
And
then
she
is
so
beautiful
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
subject
that
I
can
not
discuss
,
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
daresay
not
.
<EOS>
And
I
'm
sure
I
am
the
last
person
to
wish
to
give
you
pain
.
<EOS>
But
you
see
,
 
if
the
poor
lady
has
done
nothing
to
merit
your
anger
,
it
does
seem
rather
a
strong
measure
to
throw
her
off
and
give
her
no
reason
whatever
.
<EOS>
How
would
you
defend
yourself
,
suppose
she
published
it
all
?
"
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
's
courage
was
very
great
,
 
and
perhaps
we
may
say
her
impudence
also
.
<EOS>
This
last
question
Lord
Fawn
left
unanswered
,
walking
away
in
great
dudgeon
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
course
of
the
week
he
told
his
sister
of
the
interview
which
he
had
promised
,
and
she
endeavoured
to
induce
him
to
postpone
it
till
a
certain
man
should
arrive
from
Scotland
.
<EOS>
She
had
written
for
Mr.
Andrew
Gowran
,
 
sending
down
funds
for
Mr.
Gowran
's
journey
,
 
so
that
her
brother
might
hear
Mr.
Gowran
's
evidence
out
of
Mr.
Gowran
's
own
mouth
.
<EOS>
Would
not
Frederic
postpone
the
interview
till
he
should
have
seen
Mr.
Gowran
?
<EOS>
But
to
this
request
Frederic
declined
to
accede
.
<EOS>
He
had
fixed
a
day
and
an
hour
.
<EOS>
He
had
made
an
appointment
;
 
of
course
he
must
keep
it
.
   
<EOS>
Humpty
Dumpty
 
<EOS>
The
robbery
at
the
house
in
Hertford
Street
took
place
on
the
30th
of
January
,
and
on
the
morning
of
the
28th
of
February
Bunfit
and
Gager
were
sitting
together
in
a
melancholy
,
dark
little
room
in
Scotland
Yard
,
discussing
the
circumstances
of
that
nefarious
act
.
<EOS>
A
month
had
gone
by
,
and
nobody
was
yet
in
custody
.
<EOS>
A
month
had
passed
since
that
second
robbery
;
but
nearly
eight
weeks
had
passed
since
the
robbery
at
Carlisle
,
and
even
that
was
still
a
mystery
.
<EOS>
The
newspapers
had
been
loud
in
their
condemnation
of
the
police
.
<EOS>
It
had
been
asserted
over
and
over
again
that
in
no
other
civilised
country
in
the
world
could
so
great
an
amount
of
property
have
passed
through
the
hands
of
thieves
without
leaving
some
clue
by
which
the
police
would
have
made
their
way
to
the
truth
.
<EOS>
Major
Mackintosh
had
been
declared
to
be
altogether
incompetent
,
and
all
the
Bunfits
and
Gagers
of
the
force
had
been
spoken
of
as
drones
and
moles
and
ostriches
.
<EOS>
They
were
idle
and
blind
,
and
so
stupid
as
to
think
that
,
when
they
saw
nothing
,
others
saw
less
.
<EOS>
The
major
,
who
was
a
broad
-
shouldered
,
philosophical
man
,
bore
all
this
as
though
it
were
,
of
necessity
,
a
part
of
the
burthen
of
his
profession
;
 
but
the
Bunfits
and
Gagers
were
very
angry
,
and
at
their
wits
"
ends
.
<EOS>
It
did
not
occur
to
them
to
feel
animosity
against
the
newspapers
which
abused
them
.
<EOS>
The
thieves
who
would
not
be
caught
were
their
great
enemies
;
and
there
was
common
to
them
a
conviction
that
men
so
obstinate
as
these
thieves
,
 
<EOS>
men
to
whom
a
large
amount
of
grace
and
liberty
for
indulgence
had
accrued
,
 
should
be
treated
with
uncommon
severity
when
they
were
caught
.
<EOS>
There
was
this
excuse
always
on
their
lips
,
 
<EOS>
that
had
it
been
an
affair
simply
of
thieves
,
such
as
thieves
<EOS>
ordinarily
are
,
everything
would
have
been
discovered
long
since
;
 
but
when
lords
and
ladies
with
titles
come
to
be
mixed
up
with
such
an
affair
,
 
folk
in
whose
house
a
policeman
ca
n't
have
his
will
at
searching
and
brow
-
beating
,
 
<EOS>
how
is
a
detective
to
detect
anything
?
  
<EOS>
Bunfit
and
Gager
had
both
been
driven
to
recast
their
theories
as
to
the
great
Carlisle
affair
by
the
circumstances
of
the
later
affair
in
Hertford
Street
.
<EOS>
They
both
thought
that
Lord
George
had
been
concerned
in
the
robbery
;
 
that
,
indeed
,
had
now
become
the
general
opinion
of
the
world
at
large
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
man
of
doubtful
character
,
with
large
expenses
,
and
with
no
recognised
means
of
living
.
<EOS>
He
had
formed
a
great
intimacy
with
Lady
Eustace
at
a
period
in
which
she
was
known
to
be
carrying
these
diamonds
about
with
her
,
had
been
staying
with
her
at
Portray
Castle
when
the
diamonds
were
there
,
and
had
been
her
companion
on
the
journey
during
which
the
diamonds
were
stolen
.
<EOS>
The
only
men
in
London
supposed
to
be
capable
of
dealing
advantageously
with
such
a
property
were
Harter
and
Benjamin
,
 
as
to
whom
it
was
known
that
they
were
conversant
with
the
existence
of
the
diamonds
,
and
known
,
also
,
that
they
were
in
the
habit
of
having
dealings
with
Lord
George
.
<EOS>
It
was
,
moreover
,
known
that
Lord
George
had
been
closeted
with
Mr.
Benjamin
on
the
morning
after
his
arrival
in
London
.
<EOS>
These
things
put
together
made
it
almost
a
certainty
that
Lord
George
had
been
concerned
in
the
matter
.
<EOS>
Bunfit
had
always
been
sure
of
it
.
<EOS>
Gager
,
though
differing
much
from
Bunfit
as
to
details
,
had
never
been
unwilling
to
suspect
Lord
George
.
<EOS>
But
the
facts
known
could
not
be
got
to
dovetail
themselves
pleasantly
.
<EOS>
If
Lord
George
had
possessed
himself
of
the
diamonds
at
Carlisle
,
 
or
with
Lizzie
's
connivance
before
they
reached
Carlisle
,
 
then
,
why
had
there
been
a
second
robbery
?
<EOS>
Bunfit
,
who
was
very
profound
in
his
theory
,
suggested
that
the
second
robbery
was
an
additional
plant
,
got
up
with
the
view
of
throwing
more
dust
into
the
eyes
of
the
police
.
<EOS>
Patience
Crabstick
had
,
of
course
,
been
one
of
the
gang
throughout
,
and
she
had
now
been
allowed
to
go
off
with
her
mistress
's
money
and
lesser
trinkets
,
 
so
that
the
world
of
Scotland
Yard
might
be
thrown
more
and
more
into
the
mire
of
ignorance
and
darkness
of
doubt
.
<EOS>
To
this
view
Gager
was
altogether
opposed
.
<EOS>
He
was
inclined
to
think
that
Lord
George
had
taken
the
diamonds
at
Carlisle
with
Lizzie
's
connivance
;
 
that
he
had
restored
them
in
London
to
her
keeping
,
finding
the
suspicion
against
him
too
heavy
to
admit
of
his
dealing
with
them
,
 
and
that
now
he
had
stolen
them
a
second
time
,
again
with
Lizzie
's
connivance
;
but
in
this
latter
point
Gager
did
not
pretend
to
the
assurance
of
any
conviction
.
  
<EOS>
But
Gager
at
the
present
moment
had
achieved
a
triumph
in
the
matter
which
he
was
not
at
all
disposed
to
share
with
his
elder
officer
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
,
on
the
whole
,
more
power
is
lost
than
gained
by
habits
of
secrecy
.
<EOS>
To
be
discreet
is
a
fine
thing
,
 
especially
for
a
policeman
;
but
when
discretion
is
carried
to
such
a
length
in
the
direction
of
self
-
confidence
as
to
produce
a
belief
that
no
aid
is
wanted
for
the
achievement
of
great
results
,
it
will
often
militate
against
all
achievement
.
<EOS>
Had
Scotland
Yard
been
less
discreet
and
more
confidential
,
the
mystery
might
,
perhaps
,
have
been
sooner
unravelled
.
<EOS>
Gager
at
this
very
moment
had
reason
to
believe
that
a
man
whom
he
knew
could
,
 
and
would
,
if
operated
upon
duly
,
 
communicate
to
him
,
Gager
,
the
secret
of
the
present
whereabouts
of
Patience
Crabstick
!
<EOS>
That
belief
was
a
great
possession
,
and
much
too
important
,
as
Gager
thought
,
to
be
shared
lightly
with
such
an
one
as
Mr.
Bunfit
,
 
a
thick
-
headed
sort
of
man
,
in
Gager
's
opinion
,
although
,
no
doubt
,
he
had
by
means
of
industry
been
successful
in
some
difficult
cases
.
  
<EOS>
"
"
Is
lordship
ai
n't

,
"
said
Bunfit
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
mean
,
 
stirred
,
Mr.
Bunfit
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Ai

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
should
he
move
out
of
London
for
?
<EOS>
What
could
he
get
by
cutting
?
<EOS>
There
ai
n't
nothing
so
bad
<EOS>
when
anything
's
up
against
one
as
letting
on
that
one
wants
to
bolt
.
<EOS>
He
knows
all
that
.
<EOS>
He
'll
stand
his
ground
.
<EOS>
He
wo
n't
bolt

do

Gager

It
's
a
rum
go
;
ai
n't
it
?
 
<EOS>
the
rummest
as
I
ever
see
.
<EOS>
"
This
remark
had
been
made
so
often
by
Mr.
Bunfit
,
that
Gager
had
become
almost
weary
of
hearing
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
 
rum
;
rum
be
b
 
<EOS>
---
What
's
the
use
of
all
that
?
<EOS>
From
what
the
governor
told
me
this
morning
,
there
is
n't
a
shadow
of
doubt
where
the
diamonds
are
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
In
Paris
,
 
of
course
,
"
said
Bunfit
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
never
went
to
Paris
.
<EOS>
They
were
taken
from
here
to
Hamburg
in
a
commercial
man
's
kit
,
 
a
fellow
as
travels
in
knives
and
scissors
.
<EOS>
Then
they
was
recut
.
<EOS>
They
say
the
cutting
was
the
quickest
bit
of
work
ever
done
by
one
man
in
Hamburg
.
<EOS>
And
now
they
're
in
New
York
.
<EOS>
That
's
what
has
come
of
the
diamonds
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Benjamin
,
in
course
,
"
said
Bunfit
,
in
a
low
whisper
,
just
taking
the
pipe
from
between
his
lips
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
;
 
yes
.
<EOS>
No
doubt
it
was
Benjamin
.
<EOS>
But
how
did
Benjamin
get
"
em
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Lord
George
,
 
in
course
,
"
said
Bunfit
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
how
did
he
get
"
em
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
;
 
that
's
where
it
is
;
is
n't
it
?
"
<EOS>
Then
there
was
a
pause
,
during
which
Bunfit
continued
to
smoke
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
sure
as
your
name
's
Gager
,
he
got
"
em
at
Carlisle
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
took
Smiler
down
to
Carlisle
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Just
to
put
a
face
on
it
,
"
said
Bunfit
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
who
cut
the
door
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Billy
Cann
did
,
"
said
Bunfit
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
who
forced
the
box
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Them
two
did
,
"
said
Bunfit
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
all
to
put
a
face
on
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
 
just
that
.
<EOS>
And
an
uncommon
good
face
they
did
put
on
it
between
"
em
;
 
the
best
as
I
ever
see
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
All
right
,
"
said
Gager
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
So
far
,
so
good
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
agree
with
you
,
Mr.
Bunfit
;
because
the
thing
,
when
it
was
done
,
would
n't
be
worth
the
money
.
<EOS>
Lord
love
you
,
what
would
all
that
have
cost
?
<EOS>
And
what
was
to
prevent
the
lady
and
Lord
George
together
taking
the
diamonds
to
Benjamin
and
getting
their
price
?
<EOS>
It
never
does
to
be
too
clever
,
Mr.
Bunfit
.
<EOS>
And
when
that
was
all
done
,
why
did
the
lady
go
and
get
herself
robbed
again
?
<EOS>
No
;
 
I
do
n't
say
but
<EOS>
what
you
're
a
clever
man
,
in
your
way
,
Mr.
Bunfit
;
but
you
've
not
got
a
hold
of
the
thing
here
.
<EOS>
Why
was
Smiler
going
about
like
a
mad
dog
,
 
only
that
he
found
himself
took
in
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Maybe
he
expected
something
else
in
the
box
,
 
more
than
the
necklace
,
 
as
was
to
come
to
him
,
"
suggested
Bunfit
.
  
<EOS>
"
Gammon
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
see
why
you
say
gammon
,
Gager
.
<EOS>
It
ai
n't
polite
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
gammon
,
 
running
away
with
ideas
like
them
,
just
as
if
you
was
one
of
the
public
.
<EOS>
When
they
two
opened
that
box
at
Carlisle
,
which
they
did
as
certain
as
you
sit
there
,
they
believed
as
the
diamonds
were
there
.
<EOS>
They
were
not
there
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
as
they
was
,
"
said
Bunfit
.
  
<EOS>
"
Very
well
;
 
where
were
they
?
<EOS>
Just
walk
up
to
it
,
Mr.
Bunfit
,
making
your
ground
good
as
you
go
.
<EOS>
They
two
men
cut
the
door
,
and
took
the
box
,
and
opened
it
,
 
and
when
they
'd
opened
it
,
they
did
n't
get
the
swag
.
<EOS>
Where
was
the
swag
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Lord
George
,
"
said
Bunfit
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
Very
well
,
 
Lord
George
.
<EOS>
Like
enough
.
<EOS>
But
it
comes
to
this
.
<EOS>
Benjamin
,
and
they
two
men
of
his
,
had
laid
themselves
out
for
the
robbery
.
<EOS>
Now
,
Mr.
Bunfit
,
whether
Lord
George
and
Benjamin
were
together
in
that
first
affair
,
or
whether
they
were
n't
,
I
ca
n't
see
my
way
just
at
present
,
and
I
do
n't
know
as
you
can
see
yours
;
 
<EOS>
not
saying
but
what
you
're
as
quick
as
most
men
,
Mr.
Bunfit
.
<EOS>
If
he
was
,
 
<EOS>
and
I
rayther
think
that
's
about
it
,
 
<EOS>
then
he
and
Benjamin
must
have
had
a
few
words
,
and
he
must
have
got
the
jewels
from
the
lady
over
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
he
did
,
 
and
Smiler
and
Billy
Cann
knew
as
they
were
n't
there
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
you
are
,
all
back
again
,
Mr.
Bunfit
,
not
making
your
ground
good
as
you
go
.
<EOS>
Smiler
and
Cann
did
their
job
according
to
order
,
 
and
precious
sore
hearts
<EOS>
they
had
when
they
'd
got
the
box
open
.
<EOS>
Those
fellows
at
Carlisle
,
 
just
like
all
the
provincials
,
 
went
to
work
open
-
mouthed
,
and
before
the
party
had
left
Carlisle
it
was
known
that
Lord
George
was
suspected
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
ca
n't
trust
them
fellows
any
way
,
"
said
Mr.
Bunfit
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
;
 
what
happens
next
?
<EOS>
Lord
George
,
he
goes
to
Benjamin
,
but
he
is
n't
goin'
to
take
the
diamonds
with
him
.
<EOS>
He
has
had
words
with
Benjamin
or
he
has
not
.
<EOS>
Any
ways
he
is
n't
goin'
to
take
the
necklace
with
him
on
that
morning
.
<EOS>
He
has
n't
been
goin'
to
keep
the
diamonds
about
him
,
not
since
what
was
up
at
Carlisle
.
<EOS>
So
he
gives
the
diamonds
back
to
the
lady
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
she
had
"
em
all
along
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
say
it
was
so
,
 
<EOS>
but
I
can
see
my
way
upon
that
hypothesis
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
was
something
as
she
had
to
conceal
,
Gager
.
<EOS>
I
've
said
that
all
through
.
<EOS>
I
knew
it
in
a
moment
when
I
see'd
her
faint
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
's
had
a
deal
to
conceal
,
I
do
n't
doubt
.
<EOS>
Well
,
there
they
are
,
 
with
her
still
,
 
and
the
box
is
gone
,
and
the
people
as
is
bringing
the
lawsuit
,
Mr.
Camperdown
and
the
rest
of
"
em
,
is
off
their
tack
.
<EOS>
What
's
she
to
do
with
"
em
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Take
"
em
to
Benjamin
,
"
said
Bunfit
,
with
confidence
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
all
very
well
,
Mr.
Bunfit
.
<EOS>
But
there
's
a
quarrel
up
already
with
Benjamin
.
<EOS>
Benjamin
was
to
have
had
"
em
before
.
<EOS>
Benjamin
has
spent
a
goodish
bit
of
money
,
and
has
been
thrown
over
rather
.
<EOS>
I
daresay
Benjamin
was
as
bad
as
Smiler
,
or
worse
.
<EOS>
No
doubt
Benjamin
let
on
to
Smiler
,
and
thought
as
Smiler
was
too
many
for
him
.
<EOS>
I
daresay
there
was
a
few
words
between
him
and
Smiler
.
<EOS>
I
would
n't
wonder
if
Smiler
did
n't
threaten
to
punch
Benjamin
's
head
,
 
which
<EOS>
well
he
could
do
it
,
 
and
if
there
was
n't
a
few
playful
remarks
between
"
em
about
penal
servitude
for
life
.
<EOS>
You
see
,
Mr.
Bunfit
,
it
could
n't
have
been
pleasant
for
any
of
"
em
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
'd
've
split
,
"
said
Bunfit
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
they
did
n't
,
 
not
downright
.
<EOS>
Well
,
 
there
we
are
.
<EOS>
The
diamonds
is
with
the
lady
.
<EOS>
Lord
George
has
done
it
all
.
<EOS>
Lord
George
and
Lady
Eustace
,
 
they
're
keeping
company
,
no
doubt
,
after
their
own
fashion
.
<EOS>
He
's
a
-
robbing
of
her
,
and
she
has
to
do
pretty
much
as
she
's
bid
.
<EOS>
The
diamonds
is
with
the
lady
,
and
Lord
George
is
pretty
well
afraid
to
look
at
"
em
.
<EOS>
After
all
that
's
being
done
,
there
is
n't
much
to
wonder
at
in
that
.
<EOS>
Then
comes
the
second
robbery
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
Lord
George
planned
that
too
?
"
asked
Bunfit
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
pretend
to
say
I
know
,
but
just
put
it
this
way
,
Mr.
Bunfit
.
<EOS>
Of
course
the
thieves
were
let
in
by
the
woman
Crabstick
.
"
  
"
Not
a
doubt
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
they
was
Smiler
and
Billy
Cann
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
they
was
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
was
always
about
the
lady
,
 
a
-
doing
for
her
in
everything
.
<EOS>
Say
she
goes
to
Benjamin
and
tells
him
as
how
her
lady
still
has
the
necklace
,
 
<EOS>
and
then
he
puts
up
the
second
robbery
.
<EOS>
Then
you
'd
have
it
all
round
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
Lord
George
would
have
lost
"
em
.
<EOS>
It
ca
n't
be
.
<EOS>
Lord
George
and
he
are
thick
as
thieves
up
to
this
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
well
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
say
anything
against
that
.
<EOS>
Lord
George
knows
as
she
has
"
em
;
 
<EOS>
indeed
he
'd
given
"
em
back
to
her
to
keep
.
<EOS>
We
've
got
as
far
as
that
,
Mr.
Bunfit
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
she
did
"
ave
"
em
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
well
.
<EOS>
What
does
Lord
George
do
then
?
<EOS>
He
ca
n't
make
money
of
"
em
.
<EOS>
They
're
too
hot
for
his
fingers
,
and
so
he
finds
when
he
thinks
of
taking
"
em
into
the
market
.
<EOS>
So
he
puts
Benjamin
up
to
the
second
robbery
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Who
's
drawing
it
fine
,
now
,
Gager
;
 
eh
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Bunfit
,
I
'm
not
saying
as
I
've
got
the
truth
beyond
this
,
 
that
Benjamin
and
his
two
men
were
clean
done
at
Carlisle
,
that
Lord
George
and
his
lady
brought
the
jewels
up
to
town
between
"
em
,
and
that
the
party
who
did
n't
get
"
em
at
Carlisle
tried
their
hand
again
and
did
get
"
em
in
Hertford
Street
.
<EOS>
"
In
all
of
which
the
ingenious
Gager
would
have
been
right
,
if
he
could
have
kept
his
mind
clear
from
the
alluring
conviction
that
a
lord
had
been
the
chief
of
the
thieves
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
shall
never
make
a
case
of
it
now
,
"
said
Bunfit
despondently
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
mean
to
try
it
on
all
the
same
.
<EOS>
There
's
Smiler
about
town
as
bold
as
brass
,
and
dressed
to
the
nines
.
<EOS>
He
had
the
cheek
to
tell
me
he
was
going
down
to
the
Newmarket
Spring
to
look
after
a
horse
<EOS>
he
's
got
a
share
in
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
talking
to
Billy
only
yesterday
,
"
added
Bunfit
.
<EOS>
"
I
've
got
it
on
my
mind
that
they
did
n't
treat
Billy
quite
on
the
square
.
<EOS>
He
did
n't
let
on
anything
about
Benjamin
;
but
he
told
me
out
plain
,
as
how
he
was
very
much
disgusted
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Bunfit

said
he
,
"
there
's
that
roguery
about

that
a
plain
man

me
ca
n't
touch
it

There
's
them
as'd
pick
my
eyes
out
while
I
was
sleeping
,
and
then
swear
it
against
my
very
self

<EOS>
"
Them
were
his
words

I
knew
as
how
Benjamin
had
n't
been
on
the
square
with
him

<EOS>

You
did
n't
let
on
anything
,
Mr.

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
 
I
just
reminded
him
as
how
there
was
five
hundred
pounds
going
a
-
begging
from
Mr.
Camperdown
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
what
did
he
say
to
that
,
Mr.
Bunfit

"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
he
said
a
good
deal

He
's
a
sharp
little
fellow

Billy

has
read
a
deal

You
've
heard
of

Umpty
Dumpty

Umpty

All
right

As
had

the
diamonds

Them
diamonds

All

Billy
was
about
right
there

said
the
younger
officer
,
rising
from
his
seat

<EOS>
Late
on
the
afternoon
of
the
same
day
,
when
London
had
already
been
given
over
to
the
gaslights
,
Mr.
Gager
,
having
dressed
himself
especially
for
the
occasion
of
the
friendly
visit
which
he
intended
to
make
,
sauntered
into
a
small
public
-
house
at
the
corner
of
Meek
Street
and
Pineapple
Court
,
which
locality
,
 
as
all
men
well
versed
with
London
are
aware
,
 
lies
within
one
minute
's
walk
of
the
top
of
Gray
's
Inn
Lane
.
<EOS>
Gager
,
during
his
conference
with
his
colleague
Bunfit
,
had
been
dressed
in
plain
black
clothes
;
but
in
spite
of
his
plain
clothes
he
looked
every
inch
a
policeman
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
stiffness
about
his
limbs
,
and
,
at
the
same
time
,
a
sharpness
in
his
eyes
,
which
,
in
the
conjunction
with
the
locality
in
which
he
was
placed
,
declared
his
profession
beyond
the
possibility
of
mistake
.
<EOS>
Nor
,
in
that
locality
,
would
he
have
desired
to
be
taken
for
anything
else
.
<EOS>
But
as
he
entered
the
"
Rising
Sun
"
in
Meek
Street
,
there
was
nothing
of
the
policeman
about
him
.
<EOS>
He
might
probably
have
been
taken
for
a
betting
man
,
with
whom
the
world
had
latterly
gone
well
enough
to
enable
him
to
maintain
that
sleek
,
easy
,
greasy
appearance
which
seems
to
be
the
beau
-
ideal
of
a
betting
man
's
personal
ambition
.
"
<EOS>
Well
,
Mr.
Howard
,
"
said
the
lady
at
the
bar
,
"
a
sight
of
you
is
good
for
sore
eyes
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Six
penn'orth
of
brandy
,
 
warm
,
if
you
please
,
my
dear
,
"
said
the
pseudo
-
Howard
,
as
he
strolled
easily
into
an
inner
room
,
with
which
he
seemed
to
be
quite
familiar
.
<EOS>
He
seated
himself
in
an
old
-
fashioned
wooden
arm
-
chair
,
gazed
up
at
the
gas
lamp
,
and
stirred
his
liquor
slowly
.
<EOS>
Occasionally
he
raised
the
glass
to
his
lips
,
but
he
did
not
seem
to
be
at
all
intent
upon
his
drinking
.
<EOS>
When
he
entered
the
room
,
there
had
been
a
gentleman
and
a
lady
there
,
whose
festive
moments
seemed
to
be
disturbed
by
some
slight
disagreement
;
but
Howard
,
as
he
gazed
at
the
lamp
,
paid
no
attention
to
them
whatever
.
<EOS>
They
soon
left
the
room
,
their
quarrel
and
their
drink
finished
together
,
and
others
dropped
in
and
out
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Howard
's
"
warm
"
must
almost
have
become
cold
,
so
long
did
he
sit
there
,
gazing
at
the
gas
lamps
rather
than
attending
to
his
brandy
and
water
.
<EOS>
Not
a
word
did
he
speak
to
any
one
for
more
than
an
hour
,
and
not
a
sign
<EOS>
did
he
show
of
impatience
.
<EOS>
At
last
he
was
alone
;
 
but
had
not
been
so
for
above
a
minute
when
in
stepped
a
jaunty
<EOS>
little
man
,
certainly
not
more
than
five
feet
high
,
about
three
or
four
and
twenty
years
of
age
,
dressed
with
great
care
,
with
his
trousers
sticking
to
his
legs
,
with
a
French
chimney
-
pot
hat
on
his
head
,
very
much
peaked
fore
and
aft
and
closely
turned
up
at
the
sides
.
<EOS>
He
had
a
bright
-
coloured
silk
handkerchief
round
his
neck
,
and
a
white
shirt
,
of
which
the
collar
and
wristbands
were
rather
larger
and
longer
than
suited
the
small
dimensions
of
the
man
.
<EOS>
He
wore
a
white
greatcoat
tight
buttoned
round
his
waist
,
but
so
arranged
as
to
show
the
glories
of
the
coloured
handkerchief
;
and
in
his
hand
he
carried
a
diminutive
cane
with
a
little
silver
knob
.
<EOS>
He
stepped
airily
into
the
room
,
and
as
he
did
<EOS>
so
he
addressed
our
friend
the
policeman
with
much
cordiality
.
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Mr.
"
Oward
,
"
he
said
,
"
this
is
a
pleasure
.
<EOS>
This
is
a
pleasure
.
<EOS>
This
is
a
pleasure
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
it
to
be
?
"
asked
Gager
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
;
 
ay
,
what
?
<EOS>
Shall
I
say
a
little
port
wine
negus
,
with
the
nutmeg
in
it
rayther
strong
?
<EOS>
"
This
suggestion
he
made
to
a
young
lady
from
the
bar
,
who
had
followed
him
into
the
room
.
<EOS>
The
negus
was
brought
and
paid
for
by
Gager
,
who
then
requested
that
they
might
be
left
there
undisturbed
for
five
minutes
.
<EOS>
The
young
lady
promised
to
do
her
best
,
and
then
closed
the
door
.
"
<EOS>
And
now
,
Mr.
"
Oward
,
what
can
I
do
for
you
?
"
said
Mr.
Cann
,
the
burglar
.
  
<EOS>
Gager
,
before
he
answered
,
took
a
pipe
-
case
out
of
his
pocket
,
and
lit
the
pipe
.
<EOS>
"
Will
you
smoke
,
Billy
?
"
said
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
;
 
no
,
I
do
n't
know
that
I
will
smoke
.
<EOS>
A
very
little
tobacco
goes
a
long
way
with
me
,
Mr.
"
Oward
.
<EOS>
One
cigar
before
I
turn
in
;
 
<EOS>
that
's
about
the
outside
of
it
.
<EOS>
You
see
,
Mr.
"
Oward
,
pleasures
should
never
be
made
necessities
,
when
the
circumstances
of
a
gentleman
's
life
may
perhaps
require
that
they
shall
be
abandoned
for
prolonged
periods
.
<EOS>
In
your
line
of
life
,
Mr.
"
Oward
,
 
which
has
its
objections
,
 
smoking
may
be
pretty
well
a
certainty
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Cann
,
as
he
made
these
remarks
,
skipped
about
the
room
,
and
gave
point
to
his
argument
by
touching
Mr.
Howard
's
waistcoat
with
the
end
of
his
cane
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
now
,
Billy
,
how
about
the
young
woman
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
n't
set
eyes
on
her
these
six
weeks
,
Mr.
"
Oward
.
<EOS>
I
never
see
her
<EOS>
but
once
in
my
life
,
Mr.
"
Oward
;
 
or
,
maybe
,
twice
,
for
one
's
memory
is
deceitful
;
and
I
do
n't
know
that
I
ever
wish
to
see
her
again
.
<EOS>
She
ai
n't
one
of
my

,
Mr.
"
Oward
.
<EOS>
I

soft

This

what

Mr.

Oward

<EOS>
And
then
for
manner

she

no

a

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
's
in
London
,
Billy
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
am
I
to
know
,
Mr.
"
Oward
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
good
,
then
,
of
your
coming
here
?
"
asked
Gager
,
with
no
little
severity
in
his
voice
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
as
it
is
good
.
<EOS>
I
"
aven't
said
nothing
about
any
good
,
Mr.

Oward
.
<EOS>
What
you
wants
to
find
is
them
diamonds
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
I
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well

you

<EOS>
I

nothing

<EOS>
You

Mr.

Oward

"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
a
doubt
about
it

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
know
yours
.
<EOS>
I
'm
in
the
way
of
hearing
about
these
things
,
 
and
for
the
matter
of
that

so
are
you

<EOS>
It

be

my

are
the
longer

<EOS>
I

You

expect
me
to
tell
you
more
than
just
that

<EOS>
I
"
ave

eard

<EOS>
It
was
a
pretty
thing
,
was
n't
it
?
<EOS>
But
I
was
n't
in
it
myself
,
more
's
the
pity
.
<EOS>
You
ca
n't
expect
fairer
than
that

Mr.

Oward

"
  
<EOS>
"
And
what

"
  
<EOS>
"
Them

That

If
you

information

Mr.

you
should
say
information

<EOS>

And
you
could
give

;
 
eh
,
Billy
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No

no

He
uttered
these
two
negatives
in
a
low
voice
,
and
with
much
deliberation
.
<EOS>
"
I
could
n't
give
it
.
<EOS>
A
man
ca
n't
give
what
he
has
n't
got
;
 
but
perhaps
I
could
get
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
an
ass
you
are
,
Billy
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
know
that
I
know
all
about

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
an
ass
you
are

Mr.

Oward
.
<EOS>
Do

I
know
that
you

you

n't
come
to
me

<EOS>
You
guess

<EOS>
You
're
always
a

guessing

<EOS>
And
because
you

they

<EOS>
What
is
it
to
be
,
if
I
find
out
where
that
young
woman
is
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
tenner
,
Billy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Five
quid
now
,
and
five
when
you
've
seen
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
All
right
,
Billy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
's
a
-
going
to
be
married
to
Smiler
next
Sunday
as
ever
is
down
at
Ramsgate
;
 
and
at
Ramsgate
<EOS>
she
is
now
.
<EOS>
You
'll
find
her
,
Mr.
"
Oward
,
if
you
'll
keep
your
eyes
open
,
somewhere
about
the
"
Fiddle
with
One
String
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
This
information
was
so
far
recognised
by
Mr.
Howard
as
correct
,
that
he
paid
Mr.
Cann
five
sovereigns
down
for
it
at
once
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
Fiddle
with
One
String
"
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Gager
reached
Ramsgate
by
the
earliest
train
on
the
following
morning
,
and
was
not
long
in
finding
out
the
"
Fiddle
with
One
String
.
<EOS>
"
The
"
Fiddle
with
One
String
"
was
a
public
-
house
,
very
humble
in
appearance
,
in
the
outskirts
of
the
town
,
on
the
road
leading
to
Pegwell
Bay
.
<EOS>
On
this
occasion
Mr.
Gager
was
dressed
in
his
ordinary
plain
clothes
,
and
though
the
policeman
's
calling
might
not
be
so
manifestly
declared
by
his
appearance
at
Ramsgate
as
it
was
in
Scotland
Yard
,
 
still
,
let
a
hint
in
that
direction
have
ever
been
given
,
and
the
ordinary
citizens
of
Ramsgate
would
at
once
be
convinced
that
the
man
was
what
he
was
.
<EOS>
Gager
had
doubtless
considered
all
the
circumstances
of
his
day
's
work
carefully
,
and
had
determined
that
success
would
more
probably
attend
him
with
this
than
with
any
other
line
of
action
.
<EOS>
He
walked
at
once
into
the
house
,
and
asked
whether
a
young
woman
was
not
lodging
there
.
<EOS>
The
man
of
the
house
was
behind
the
bar
,
with
his
wife
,
and
to
him
Gager
whispered
a
few
words
.
<EOS>
The
man
stood
dumb
for
a
moment
,
and
then
his
wife
spoke
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
's
up
now
?
"
said
she
.
<EOS>
"
There
's
no
young
women
here
.
<EOS>
We
do
n't
have
no
young
women
.
<EOS>
"
Then
the
man
whispered
a
word
to
his
wife
,
during
which
Gager
stood
among
the
customers
before
the
bar
with
an
easy
,
unembarrassed
air
.
"
<EOS>
Well
,
what
's
the
odds
?
"
said
the
wife
.
<EOS>
"
There
ai
n't
anything
wrong
with
us
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Never
thought
there
was
,
ma'am
,
"
said
Gager
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
there
's
nothing
wrong
as
I
know
of
with
the
young
woman
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Then
the
husband
and
wife
consulted
together
,
and
Mr.
Gager
was
asked
to
take
a
seat
in
a
little
parlour
,
while
the
woman
ran
up
-
stairs
for
half
an
instant
.
<EOS>
Gager
looked
about
him
quickly
,
and
took
in
at
a
glance
the
system
of
the
construction
of
the
"
Fiddle
with
One
String
.
"
<EOS>
He
did
sit
down
in
the
little
parlour
,
with
the
door
open
,
and
remained
there
for
perhaps
a
couple
of
minutes
.
<EOS>
Then
he
went
to
the
front
door
,
and
glanced
up
at
the
roof
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
all
right
,
"
said
the
keeper
of
the
house
,
following
him
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
ai
n't
a
-
going
to
get
away
.
<EOS>
She
ai
n't
just
very
well
,
and
she
's
a
-
lying
down
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
tell
her
,
with
my
regards
,
"
said
Gager
,
"
that
she
need
n't
be
a
bit
the
worse
because
of
me
.
<EOS>
"
The
man
looked
at
him
suspiciously
.
<EOS>
"
You
tell
her
what
I
say
.
<EOS>
And
tell
her
,
too
,
the
quicker
the
better
.
<EOS>
She
has
a
gentleman
a
-
looking
after
her
,
I
daresay
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
I
'd
better
be
off
before
he
comes
.
<EOS>
"
The
message
was
taken
up
to
the
lady
,
and
Gager
again
seated
himself
in
the
little
parlour
.
  
<EOS>
We
are
often
told
that
all
is
fair
in
love
and
war
,
and
,
perhaps
,
the
operation
on
which
Mr.
Gager
was
now
intent
may
be
regarded
as
warlike
.
<EOS>
But
he
now
took
advantage
of
a
certain
softness
in
the
character
of
the
lady
whom
he
wished
to
meet
,
which
hardly
seems
to
be
justifiable
even
in
a
policeman
.
<EOS>
When
Lizzie
's
tall
footman
had
been
in
trouble
about
the
necklace
,
a
photograph
had
been
taken
from
him
which
had
not
been
restored
to
him
.
<EOS>
This
was
a
portrait
of
Patience
Crabstick
,
which
she
,
poor
girl
,
in
a
tender
moment
,
had
given
to
him
who
,
had
not
things
gone
roughly
with
them
,
was
to
have
been
her
lover
.
<EOS>
The
little
picture
had
fallen
into
Gager
's
hands
,
and
he
now
pulled
it
from
his
pocket
.
<EOS>
He
himself
had
never
visited
the
house
in
Hertford
Street
till
after
the
second
robbery
,
and
,
in
the
flesh
,
had
not
as
yet
seen
Miss
Crabstick
;
but
he
had
studied
her
face
carefully
,
expecting
,
or
,
at
any
rate
,
hoping
,
that
he
might
some
day
enjoy
the
pleasure
of
personal
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
That
pleasure
was
now
about
to
come
to
him
,
and
he
prepared
himself
for
it
by
making
himself
intimate
with
the
lines
of
the
lady
's
face
as
the
sun
had
portrayed
them
.
<EOS>
There
was
even
yet
some
delay
,
and
Mr.
Gager
more
than
once
testified
uneasiness
.
<EOS>
"
She
ai
n't
a
-
going
to
get
away
,
"
said
the
mistress
of
the
house
,
"
but
a
lady
as
is
going
to
see
a
gentleman
ca
n't
jump
into
her
things
as
a
man
does
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Gager
intimated
his
acquiescence
in
all
this
,
and
again
waited
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
sooner
she
comes
the
less
trouble
for
her
,
"
said
Gager
to
the
woman
;
"
if
you
'll
only
make
her
believe
that
.
<EOS>
"
At
last
,
when
he
had
been
somewhat
over
an
hour
in
the
house
,
he
was
asked
to
walk
up
-
stairs
,
and
then
,
in
a
little
sitting
-
room
over
the
bar
,
he
had
the
opportunity
,
so
much
desired
,
of
making
personal
acquaintance
with
Patience
Crabstick
.
  
<EOS>
It
may
be
imagined
that
the
poor
waiting
-
woman
had
not
been
in
a
happy
state
of
mind
since
she
had
been
told
that
a
gentleman
was
waiting
to
see
her
down
-
stairs
,
who
had
declared
himself
to
be
a
policeman
immediately
on
entering
the
shop
.
<EOS>
To
escape
was
of
course
her
first
idea
,
but
she
was
soon
made
to
understand
that
this
was
impracticable
.
<EOS>
In
the
first
place
there
was
but
one
staircase
,
at
the
bottom
of
which
was
the
open
door
of
the
room
in
which
the
policeman
was
sitting
;
and
then
,
the
woman
of
the
house
was
very
firm
in
declaring
that
she
would
connive
at
nothing
which
might
cost
her
and
her
husband
their
licence
.
<EOS>
"
You
've
got
to
face
it
,
"
said
the
woman
.
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
they
ca
n't
make
me
get
out
of
bed
unless
I
pleases
,
"
said
Patience
firmly
.
<EOS>
But
she
knew
that
even
that
resource
would
fail
her
,
and
that
a
policeman
,
when
aggravated
,
can
take
upon
him
all
the
duties
of
a
lady
's
maid
.
<EOS>
She
had
to
face
it
,
 
<EOS>
and
she
did
face
it
.
<EOS>
"
I
've
just
got
to
have
a
few
words
with
you
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Gager
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
,
then
,
we
'd
better
be
alone
,
"
said
Patience
;
whereupon
the
woman
of
the
house
discreetly
left
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
The
interview
was
so
long
that
the
reader
would
be
fatigued
were
he
asked
to
study
a
record
of
all
that
was
said
on
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
The
gentleman
and
lady
were
closeted
together
for
more
than
an
hour
,
and
so
amicably
was
the
conversation
carried
on
that
when
the
time
was
half
over
Gager
stepped
down
-
stairs
and
interested
himself
in
procuring
Miss
Crabstick
's
breakfast
.
<EOS>
He
even
condescended
himself
to
pick
a
few
shrimps
and
drink
a
glass
of
beer
in
her
company
.
<EOS>
A
great
deal
was
said
,
and
something
was
even
settled
,
as
may
be
learned
from
a
few
concluding
words
of
that
very
memorable
conversation
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Just
do
n't
you
say
anything
about
it
,
my
dear
,
but
leave
word
for
him
that
you
've
gone
up
to
town
on
business
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Lord
love
you
,
Mr.
Gager
,
he
'll
know
all
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Let
him
know
.
<EOS>
Of
course
he
'll
know
,
 
if
he
comes
down
.
<EOS>
It
's
my
belief
he
'll
never
show
himself
at
Ramsgate
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
Mr.
Gager
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
Well
,
my
dear
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
n't
a
perjuring
of
yourself
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
;
 
about
making
you
my
wife
?
<EOS>
That
I
ai
n't
.
<EOS>
I
'm
upright
,
and
always
was
.
<EOS>
There
's
no
mistake
about
me
when
you
've
got
my
word
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
this
work
is
off
my
mind
,
you
shall
be
Mrs.
Gager
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
And
you
'll
be
all
right
.
<EOS>
You
've
been
took
in
,
that
's
what
you
have
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
That
I
have
,
Mr.
Gager
,
"
said
Patience
,
wiping
her
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
've
been
took
in
,
and
you
must
be
forgiven
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
get
 
not
nothing
out
of
the
necklace
;
and
as
for
the
other
things
,
they
've
frighted
me
so
,
that
I
let
"
em
all
go
for
just
what
I
tell
you
.
<EOS>
And
as
for
Mr.
Smiler
,
 
I
never
did
n't
care
for
him
;
that
I
did
n't
.
<EOS>
He
ai
n't
the
man
to
touch
my
heart
,
 
not
at
all
;
and
it
was
not
likely
either
.
<EOS>
A
plain
fellow
,
 
very
,
Mr.
Gager
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
'll
be
plainer
before
long
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
've
been
that
worrited
among
"
em
,
Mr.
Gager
,
since
first
they
made
their
wicked
prepositions
,
that
I
've
been
jest
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
how
I
've
been
.
<EOS>
And
though
my
lady
was
not
a
lady
as
any
girl
could
like
,
and
did
deserve
to
have
her
things
took
if
anybody
's
things
ever
should
be
took
,
still
,
Mr.
Gager
,
I
knows
I
did
wrong
.
<EOS>
I
do
know
it
,
 
<EOS>
and
I
'm
a
-
repenting
of
it
in
sackcloth
and
ashes
;
 
<EOS>
so
I
am
.
<EOS>
But
you
'll
be
as
good
as
your
word
,
Mr.
Gager
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
must
be
acknowledged
that
Mr.
Gager
had
bidden
high
for
success
,
and
had
allowed
himself
to
be
carried
away
by
his
zeal
almost
to
the
verge
of
imprudence
.
<EOS>
It
was
essential
to
him
that
he
should
take
Patience
Crabstick
back
with
him
to
London
,
 
and
that
he
should
take
her
as
a
witness
and
not
as
a
criminal
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Benjamin
was
the
game
at
which
he
was
flying
,
 
Mr.
Benjamin
,
and
,
if
possible
,
Lord
George
;
and
he
conceived
that
his
net
might
be
big
enough
to
hold
Smiler
as
well
as
the
other
two
greater
fishes
,
if
he
could
induce
Patience
Crabstick
and
Billy
Cann
to
co
-
operate
with
him
cordially
in
his
fishing
.
  
<EOS>
But
his
mind
was
still
disturbed
on
one
point
.
<EOS>
Let
him
press
his
beloved
Patience
as
closely
as
he
might
with
questions
,
there
was
one
point
on
which
he
could
not
get
from
her
what
he
believed
to
be
the
truth
.
<EOS>
She
persisted
that
Lord
George
de
Bruce
Carruthers
had
had
no
hand
in
either
robbery
,
and
Gager
had
so
firmly
committed
himself
to
a
belief
on
this
matter
,
that
he
could
not
throw
the
idea
away
from
him
,
even
on
the
testimony
of
Patience
Crabstick
.
  
<EOS>
On
that
evening
he
returned
triumphant
to
Scotland
Yard
with
Patience
Crabstick
under
his
wing
;
and
that
lady
was
housed
there
with
every
comfort
she
could
desire
,
except
that
of
personal
liberty
.
   
<EOS>
Mr.
Gowran
Up
in
London
 
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
Mrs.
Hittaway
was
diligently
spreading
a
report
that
Lizzie
Eustace
either
was
engaged
to
marry
her
cousin
Frank
,
 
or
ought
to
be
so
engaged
.
<EOS>
This
she
did
,
no
doubt
,
with
the
sole
object
of
saving
her
brother
;
but
she
did
it
with
a
zeal
that
dealt
as
freely
with
Frank
's
name
as
with
Lizzie
's
.
<EOS>
They
,
with
all
their
friends
,
were
her
enemies
,
and
she
was
quite
sure
that
they
were
,
altogether
,
a
wicked
,
degraded
set
of
people
.
<EOS>
Of
Lord
George
and
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
of
Miss
Roanoke
and
Sir
Griffin
Tewett
,
she
believed
all
manner
of
evil
.
<EOS>
She
had
theories
of
her
own
about
the
jewels
,
stories
,
 
probably
of
her
own
manufacture
in
part
,
although
no
doubt
she
believed
them
to
be
true
,
 
as
to
the
manner
of
living
at
Portray
,
little
histories
of
Lizzie
's
debts
,
and
the
great
fact
of
the
scene
which
Mr.
Gowran
had
seen
with
his
own
eyes
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
Eustace
was
an
abomination
to
her
,
and
this
abominable
woman
her
brother
was
again
in
danger
of
marrying
!
<EOS>
She
was
very
loud
in
her
denunciations
,
and
took
care
that
they
should
reach
even
Lady
Linlithgow
,
so
that
poor
Lucy
Morris
might
know
of
what
sort
was
the
lover
in
whom
she
trusted
.
<EOS>
Andy
Gowran
had
been
sent
for
to
town
,
and
was
on
his
journey
while
Mr.
Gager
was
engaged
at
Ramsgate
.
<EOS>
It
was
at
present
the
great
object
of
Mrs.
Hittaway
's
life
to
induce
her
brother
to
see
Mr.
Gowran
before
he
kept
his
appointment
with
Lady
Eustace
.
  
<EOS>
Poor
Lucy
received
the
wound
which
was
intended
for
her
.
<EOS>
The
enemy
's
weapons
had
repeatedly
struck
her
,
but
hitherto
they
had
alighted
on
the
strong
shield
of
her
faith
.
<EOS>
But
let
a
shield
be
never
so
strong
,
it
may
at
last
be
battered
out
of
all
form
and
service
.
<EOS>
On
Lucy
's
shield
there
had
been
much
of
such
batterings
,
and
the
blows
which
had
come
from
him
in
whom
she
most
trusted
had
not
been
the
lightest
.
<EOS>
She
had
not
seen
him
for
months
,
and
his
letters
were
short
,
unsatisfactory
,
and
rare
.
<EOS>
She
had
declared
to
herself
and
to
her
friend
Lady
Fawn
,
that
no
concurrence
of
circumstances
,
no
absence
,
however
long
,
<EOS>
no
rumours
that
might
reach
her
ears
,
would
make
her
doubt
the
man
she
loved
.
<EOS>
She
was
still
steadfast
in
the
same
resolution
;
but
in
spite
of
her
resolution
her
heart
began
to
fail
her
.
<EOS>
She
became
weary
,
unhappy
,
and
ill
at
ease
,
and
though
she
would
never
acknowledge
to
herself
that
she
doubted
,
she
did
doubt
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
,
after
all
,
your
Mr.
Greystock
is
to
marry
my
niece
,
Lizzie
Greystock
.
<EOS>
"
This
good
-
natured
speech
was
made
one
morning
to
poor
Lucy
by
her
present
patroness
,
Lady
Linlithgow
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
rather
think
not
,
"
said
Lucy
plucking
up
her
spirits
and
smiling
as
she
spoke
.
  
<EOS>
"
Everybody
says
so
.
<EOS>
As
for
Lizzie
,
she
has
become
quite
a
heroine
.
<EOS>
What
with
her
necklace
,
and
her
two
robberies
,
and
her
hunting
,
and
her
various
lovers
,
 
two
lords
and
a
member
of
Parliament
,
my
dear
,
 
there
is
nothing
to
equal
her
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
Palliser
has
been
calling
on
her
.
<EOS>
She
took
care
to
let
me
know
that
.
<EOS>
And
I
'm
now
told
that
she
certainly
is
engaged
to
her
cousin
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
According
to
your
own
showing
,
Lady
Linlithgow
,
she
has
got
two
other
lovers
.
<EOS>
Could
n't
you
oblige
me
by
letting
her
marry
one
of
the
lords
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
afraid
,
my
dear
,
that
Mr.
Greystock
is
to
be
the
chosen
one
.
"
<EOS>
Then
after
a
pause
the
old
woman
became
serious
.
<EOS>
"
What
is
the
use
,
Miss
Morris
,
of
not
looking
the
truth
in
the
face
?
<EOS>
Mr.
Greystock
is
neglecting
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
not
neglecting
me
.
<EOS>
You
wo
n't
let
him
come
to
see
me
.
"
  
"
Certainly
not
;
 
but
if
he
were
not
neglecting
you
,
you
would
not
be
here
.
<EOS>
And
there
he
is
with
Lizzie
Eustace
every
day
of
his
life
.
<EOS>
He
ca
n't
afford
to
marry
you
,
and
he
can
afford
to
marry
her
.
<EOS>
It
's
a
deal
better
that
you
should
look
it
all
in
the
face
and
know
what
it
must
all
come
to
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
just
wait
,
 
and
never
believe
a
word
till
he
speaks
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
hardly
know
what
men
are
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
likely
not
,
Lady
Linlithgow
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
that
I
shall
have
to
pay
dear
for
learning
.
<EOS>
Of
course
,
I
may
be
mistaken
as
well
as
another
,
 
<EOS>
only
I
do
n't
believe
I
am
mistaken
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
When
this
little
scene
took
place
,
only
a
month
remained
of
the
time
for
which
Lucy
's
services
were
engaged
to
Lady
Linlithgow
,
and
no
definite
arrangement
had
been
made
as
to
her
future
residence
.
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
was
prepared
to
give
her
a
home
,
and
to
Lady
Fawn
,
as
it
seemed
,
she
must
go
.
<EOS>
Lady
Linlithgow
had
declared
herself
unwilling
to
continue
the
existing
arrangement
because
,
as
she
said
,
it
did
not
suit
her
that
her
companion
should
be
engaged
to
marry
her
late
sister
's
nephew
.
<EOS>
Not
a
word
had
been
said
about
the
deanery
for
the
last
month
or
two
,
and
Lucy
,
though
her
hopes
in
that
direction
had
once
been
good
,
was
far
too
high
-
spirited
to
make
any
suggestion
herself
as
to
her
reception
by
her
lover
's
family
.
<EOS>
In
the
ordinary
course
of
things
she
would
have
to
look
out
for
another
situation
,
like
any
other
governess
in
want
of
a
place
;
but
she
could
do
this
only
by
consulting
Lady
Fawn
;
and
Lady
Fawn
when
consulted
would
always
settle
the
whole
matter
by
simply
bidding
her
young
friend
to
come
to
Fawn
Court
.
  
<EOS>
There
must
be
some
end
of
her
living
at
Fawn
Court
.
<EOS>
So
much
Lucy
told
herself
over
and
over
again
.
<EOS>
It
could
be
but
a
temporary
measure
.
<EOS>
If
 
if
it
was
to
be
her
fate
to
be
taken
away
from
Fawn
Court
a
happy
,
glorious
,
triumphant
bride
,
then
the
additional
obligation
put
upon
her
by
her
dear
friends
would
not
be
more
than
she
could
bear
.
<EOS>
But
to
go
to
Fawn
Court
,
and
,
by
degrees
,
to
have
it
acknowledged
that
another
place
must
be
found
for
her
,
would
be
very
bad
.
<EOS>
She
would
infinitely
prefer
any
intermediate
hardship
.
<EOS>
How
,
then
,
should
she
know
?
<EOS>
As
soon
as
she
was
able
to
escape
from
the
countess
,
she
went
up
to
her
own
room
,
and
wrote
the
following
letter
.
<EOS>
She
studied
the
words
with
great
care
as
she
wrote
them
,
 
sitting
and
thinking
before
she
allowed
her
pen
to
run
on
the
paper
.
  
<EOS>
MY
DEAR
FRANK
,
  
<EOS>
It
is
a
long
time
since
we
met
;
 
is
it
not
?
<EOS>
I
do
not
write
this
as
a
reproach
;
but
because
my
friends
tell
me
that
I
should
not
continue
to
think
myself
engaged
to
you
.
<EOS>
They
say
that
,
situated
as
you
are
,
you
can
not
afford
to
marry
a
penniless
girl
,
and
that
I
ought
not
to
wish
you
to
sacrifice
yourself
.
<EOS>
I
do
understand
enough
of
your
affairs
to
know
that
an
imprudent
marriage
may
ruin
you
,
and
I
certainly
do
not
wish
to
be
the
cause
of
injury
to
you
.
<EOS>
All
I
ask
is
that
you
should
tell
me
the
truth
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
that
I
am
impatient
;
but
that
I
must
decide
what
to
do
with
myself
when
I
leave
Lady
Linlithgow
.
  
<EOS>
Your
most
affectionate
friend
,
  
LUCY
MORRIS
.
  
<EOS>
March
2
,
18
 
.
  
<EOS>
She
read
this
letter
over
and
over
again
,
thinking
of
all
that
it
said
and
of
all
that
it
omitted
to
say
.
<EOS>
She
was
at
first
half
disposed
to
make
protestations
of
forgiveness
,
 
to
assure
him
that
not
even
within
her
own
heart
would
she
reproach
him
,
should
he
feel
himself
bound
to
retract
the
promise
he
had
made
her
.
<EOS>
She
longed
to
break
out
into
love
,
but
so
to
express
her
love
that
her
lover
should
know
that
it
was
strong
enough
even
to
sacrifice
itself
for
his
sake
.
<EOS>
But
though
her
heart
longed
to
speak
freely
,
her
judgment
told
her
that
it
would
be
better
that
she
should
be
reticent
and
tranquil
in
her
language
.
<EOS>
Any
warmth
on
her
part
would
be
in
itself
a
reproach
to
him
.
<EOS>
If
she
really
wished
to
assist
him
in
extricating
himself
from
a
difficulty
into
which
he
had
fallen
in
her
behalf
,
she
would
best
do
so
by
offering
him
his
freedom
in
the
fewest
and
plainest
words
which
she
could
select
.
  
<EOS>
But
even
when
the
letter
was
written
she
doubted
as
to
the
wisdom
of
sending
it
.
<EOS>
She
kept
it
that
she
might
sleep
upon
it
.
<EOS>
She
did
sleep
upon
it
,
 
and
<EOS>
when
the
morning
came
she
would
not
send
it
.
<EOS>
Had
not
absolute
faith
in
her
lover
been
the
rock
on
which
she
had
declared
to
herself
that
she
would
build
the
house
of
her
future
hopes
?
<EOS>
Had
not
she
protested
again
and
again
that
no
caution
from
others
should
induce
her
to
waver
in
her
belief
?
<EOS>
Was
it
not
her
great
doctrine
to
trust
,
 
to
trust
implicitly
,
even
though
all
should
be
lost
if
her
trust
should
be
misplaced
?
<EOS>
And
was
it
well
that
she
should
depart
from
all
this
,
merely
because
it
might
be
convenient
for
her
to
make
arrangements
as
to
the
coming
months
?
<EOS>
If
it
were
to
be
her
fate
to
be
rejected
,
thrown
over
,
and
deceived
,
of
what
use
to
her
could
be
any
future
arrangements
?
<EOS>
All
to
her
would
be
ruin
,
and
it
would
matter
to
her
nothing
<EOS>
whither
she
should
be
taken
.
<EOS>
And
then
,
why
should
she
lie
to
him
as
she
would
lie
in
sending
such
a
letter
?
<EOS>
If
he
did
throw
her
over
he
would
be
a
traitor
,
and
her
heart
would
be
full
of
reproaches
.
<EOS>
Whatever
might
be
his
future
lot
in
life
,
he
owed
it
to
her
to
share
it
with
her
,
and
if
he
evaded
his
debt
he
would
be
a
traitor
and
a
miscreant
.
<EOS>
She
would
never
tell
him
so
.
<EOS>
She
would
be
far
too
proud
to
condescend
to
spoken
or
written
reproaches
.
<EOS>
But
she
would
know
that
it
would
be
so
,
and
why
should
she
lie
to
him
by
saying
that
it
would
not
be
so
?
<EOS>
Thinking
of
all
this
,
when
the
morning
came
,
she
left
the
letter
lying
within
her
desk
.
  
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
was
to
call
upon
Lady
Eustace
on
the
Saturday
,
and
on
Friday
afternoon
Mr.
Andrew
Gowran
was
in
Mrs.
Hittaway
's
back
parlour
in
Warwick
Square
.
<EOS>
After
many
efforts
,
and
with
much
persuasion
,
the
brother
had
agreed
to
see
his
sister
's
great
witness
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
had
felt
that
he
would
lower
himself
by
any
intercourse
with
such
a
one
as
Andy
Gowran
in
regard
to
the
conduct
of
the
woman
whom
he
had
proposed
to
make
his
wife
,
and
had
endeavoured
to
avoid
the
meeting
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
angry
,
piteous
,
haughty
,
and
sullen
by
turns
;
but
Mrs.
Hittaway
had
overcome
him
by
dogged
perseverance
;
and
poor
Lord
Fawn
had
at
last
consented
.
<EOS>
He
was
to
come
to
Warwick
Square
as
soon
as
the
House
was
up
on
Friday
evening
,
and
dine
there
.
<EOS>
Before
dinner
he
was
to
be
introduced
to
Mr.
Gowran
.
<EOS>
Andy
arrived
at
the
house
at
half
-
past
five
,
and
after
some
conversation
with
Mrs.
Hittaway
,
was
left
there
all
alone
to
await
the
coming
of
Lord
Fawn
.
<EOS>
He
was
in
appearance
and
manners
very
different
from
the
Andy
Gowran
familiarly
known
among
the
braes
and
crofts
of
Portray
.
<EOS>
He
had
a
heavy
stiff
hat
,
which
he
carried
in
his
hand
.
<EOS>
He
wore
a
black
swallow
-
tail
coat
and
black
trousers
,
and
a
heavy
red
waistcoat
buttoned
up
nearly
to
his
throat
,
round
which
was
tightly
tied
a
dingy
black
silk
handkerchief
.
<EOS>
At
Portray
no
man
was
more
voluble
,
no
man
more
self
-
confident
,
no
man
more
equal
to
his
daily
occupations
than
Andy
Gowran
;
but
the
unaccustomed
clothes
,
and
the
journey
to
London
,
and
the
town
houses
overcame
him
,
and
for
a
while
almost
silenced
him
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Hittaway
found
him
silent
,
cautious
,
and
timid
.
<EOS>
Not
knowing
what
to
do
with
him
,
fearing
to
ask
him
to
go
and
eat
in
the
kitchen
,
and
not
liking
to
have
meat
and
unlimited
drink
brought
for
him
into
the
parlour
,
she
directed
the
servant
to
supply
him
with
a
glass
of
sherry
and
a
couple
of
biscuits
.
<EOS>
He
had
come
an
hour
before
the
time
named
,
and
there
,
with
nothing
to
cheer
him
beyond
these
slight
creature
-
comforts
,
he
was
left
to
wait
all
alone
till
Lord
Fawn
should
be
ready
to
see
him
.
  
<EOS>
Andy
had
seen
lords
before
.
<EOS>
Lords
are
not
rarer
in
Ayrshire
than
in
other
Scotch
counties
;
and
then
,
had
not
Lord
George
de
Bruce
Carruthers
been
staying
at
Portray
half
the
winter
?
<EOS>
But
Lord
George
was
not
to
Andy
a
real
lord
,
 
and
then
a
lord
down
in
his
own
county
<EOS>
was
so
much
less
to
him
than
a
lord
up
in
London
.
<EOS>
And
this
lord
was
a
lord
of
Parliament
,
and
a
government
lord
,
and
might
probably
have
the
power
of
hanging
such
a
one
as
Andy
Gowran
were
he
to
commit
perjury
,
or
say
anything
which
the
lord
might
choose
to
call
perjury
.
<EOS>
What
it
was
that
Lord
Fawn
wished
him
to
say
,
he
could
not
make
himself
sure
.
<EOS>
That
the
lord
's
sister
wished
him
to
prove
Lady
Eustace
to
be
all
that
was
bad
,
he
knew
very
well
.
<EOS>
But
he
thought
that
he
was
able
to
perceive
that
the
brother
and
sister
were
not
at
one
,
and
more
than
once
during
his
journey
up
to
London
<EOS>
he
had
almost
made
up
his
mind
that
he
would
turn
tail
and
go
back
to
Portray
.
<EOS>
No
doubt
there
was
enmity
between
him
and
his
mistress
;
but
then
his
mistress
did
not
attempt
to
hurt
him
even
though
he
had
insulted
her
grossly
;
and
were
she
to
tell
him
to
leave
her
service
,
it
would
be
from
Mr.
John
Eustace
,
and
not
from
Mrs.
Hittaway
,
that
he
must
look
for
the
continuation
of
his
employment
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
he
had
taken
Mrs.
Hittaway
's
money
and
there
he
was
.
  
<EOS>
At
half
-
past
seven
Lord
Fawn
was
brought
into
the
room
by
his
sister
,
and
Andy
Gowran
,
rising
from
his
chair
,
three
times
ducked
his
head
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Gowran
,
"
said
Mrs.
Hittaway
,
"
my
brother
is
desirous
that
you
should
tell
him
exactly
what
you
have
seen
of
Lady
Eustace
's
conduct
down
at
Portray
.
<EOS>
You
may
speak
quite
freely
,
and
I
know
you
will
speak
truly
.
"
<EOS>
Andy
again
ducked
his
head
.
<EOS>
"
Frederic
,
"
continued
the
lady
,
"
I
am
sure
that
you
may
implicitly
believe
all
that
Mr.
Gowran
will
say
to
you
.
"
<EOS>
Then
Mrs.
Hittaway
left
the
room
,
 
as
her
brother
had
expressly
stipulated
that
she
should
do
.
  
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
was
quite
at
a
loss
how
to
begin
,
and
Andy
was
by
no
means
prepared
to
help
him
.
<EOS>
"
If
I
am
rightly
informed
,
"
said
the
lord
,
"
you
have
been
for
many
years
employed
on
the
Portray
property
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
'
my
life
,
 
so
please
your
lairdship
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Just
so
;
 
just
so
.
<EOS>
And
,
of
course
,
interested
in
the
welfare
of
the
Eustace
family
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nae
doobt
,
my
laird
,
 
nae
doobt
;
vera
interasted
indeed
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
being
an
honest
man
,
have
felt
sorrow
that
the
Portray
property
should
 
should
 
should
 
;
that
anything
bad
should
happen
to
it
.
"
<EOS>
Andy
nodded
his
head
,
and
Lord
Fawn
perceived
that
he
was
nowhere
near
the
beginning
of
his
matter
.
"
<EOS>
Lady
Eustace
is
at
present
your
mistress
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Just
in
a
fawshion
,
my
laird
,
 
as
a
mon
may
say
.
<EOS>
That
is
she
is
,
 
and
she
is
nae
.
<EOS>
There
's
a
mony
things
at
Portray
as
ha
"
to
be
lookit
after
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
pays
you
your
wages
?
"
said
Lord
Fawn
shortly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Eh
;
 
wages
!
<EOS>
Yes
,
my
laird
;
she
does
a
'
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
she
's
your
mistress
.
"
<EOS>
Andy
again
nodded
his
head
,
and
Lord
Fawn
again
struggled
to
find
some
way
in
which
he
might
approach
his
subject
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Her
cousin
,
Mr.
Greystock
,
has
been
staying
at
Portray
lately
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
More
coothie
than
coosinly
,
"
said
Andy
,
winking
his
eye
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
dreadful
to
Lord
Fawn
that
the
man
should
wink
his
eye
at
him
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
quite
understand
what
Andy
had
last
said
,
but
he
did
understand
that
some
accusation
as
to
indecent
familiarity
with
her
cousin
was
intended
to
be
brought
by
this
Scotch
steward
against
the
woman
to
whom
he
had
engaged
himself
.
<EOS>
Every
feeling
of
his
nature
revolted
against
the
task
before
him
,
and
he
found
that
on
trial
it
became
absolutely
impracticable
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
bring
himself
to
inquire
minutely
as
to
poor
<EOS>
Lizzie
's
flirting
down
among
the
rocks
.
<EOS>
He
was
weak
,
and
foolish
,
and
in
many
respects
ignorant
,
 
<EOS>
but
he
was
a
gentleman
.
<EOS>
As
he
got
nearer
to
the
point
which
it
had
been
intended
that
he
should
reach
,
the
more
he
hated
Andy
Gowran
,
 
and
<EOS>
the
more
he
hated
himself
for
having
submitted
to
such
contact
.
<EOS>
He
paused
a
moment
,
and
then
he
declared
that
the
conversation
was
at
an
end
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
that
will
do
,
Mr.
Gowran
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
that
you
can
tell
me
anything
I
want
to
hear
.
<EOS>
I
think
you
had
better
go
back
to
Scotland
.
"
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
left
Andy
alone
and
stalked
up
to
the
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
When
he
entered
it
,
both
Mr.
Hittaway
and
his
sister
were
there
.
"
<EOS>
Clara
,
"
he
said
very
sternly
,
"
you
had
better
send
some
one
to
dismiss
that
man
.
<EOS>
I
shall
not
speak
to
him
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
did
not
speak
to
Andy
Gowran
again
,
but
Mrs.
Hittaway
did
.
<EOS>
After
a
faint
and
futile
endeavour
made
by
her
to
ascertain
what
had
taken
place
in
the
parlour
down
-
stairs
,
she
descended
and
found
Andy
seated
in
his
chair
,
still
holding
his
hat
in
his
hand
,
as
stiff
as
a
wax
figure
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
afraid
of
the
lord
,
but
as
soon
as
the
lord
had
left
him
he
was
very
angry
with
the
lord
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
brought
up
all
that
way
to
tell
his
story
to
the
lord
,
and
the
lord
had
gone
away
without
hearing
a
word
of
it
<EOS>
,
 
had
gone
away
and
had
absolutely
insulted
him
,
had
asked
him
who
paid
him
his
wages
,
and
had
then
told
him
that
Lady
Eustace
was
his
mistress
.
<EOS>
Andy
Gowran
felt
strongly
that
this
was
not
that
kind
of
confidential
usage
which
he
had
had
a
right
to
expect
.
<EOS>
And
after
his
experience
of
the
last
hour
and
a
half
,
he
did
not
at
all
relish
his
renewed
solitude
in
that
room
.

It
was
thus
that
Andy
afterwards
spoke
to
his
wife
of
the
hospitalities
offered
to
him
in
Warwick
Square
,
regarding
which
his
anger
was
especially
hot
,
in
that
he
had
been
treated
like
a
child
or
a
common
labourer
,
instead
of
having
the
decanter
left
with
him
to
be
used
at
his
own
discretion
.
<EOS>
When
,
therefore
,
Mrs.
Hittaway
returned
to
him
,
the
awe
with
which
new
circumstances
and
the
lord
had
filled
him
was
fast
vanishing
,
and
giving
place
to
that
stubborn
indignation
against
people
in
general
which
was
his
normal
,
condition
.
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
I
'm
jist
to
gang

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
This
he
said
the
moment
the
lady
entered
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
But
Mrs.
Hittaway
did
not
want
to
lose
his
services
quite
so
soon
.
<EOS>
She
expressed
regret
that
her
brother
should
have
found
himself
unable
to
discuss
a
subject
that
was
naturally
so
very
distasteful
to
him
,
and
begged
Mr.
Gowran
to
come
to
her
again
the
next
morning
.
<EOS>
"

"
  
<EOS>
All
this
was
said
with
so
much
unction
that
even
Mrs.
Hittaway
herself
found
it
to
be
not
"
tasteful
.
"
<EOS>
She
shrunk
and
shivered
under
Mr.
Gowran
's
eloquence
,
and
almost
repented
of
her
zeal
.
<EOS>
But
women
,
perhaps
,
feel
less
repugnance
than
do
men
at
using
ignoble
assistance
in
the
achievement
of
good
purposes
.
<EOS>
Though
Mrs.
Hittaway
shrunk
and
shivered
under
the
strong
action
with
which
Mr.
Gowran
garnished
his
strong
words
,
still
she
was
sure
of
the
excellence
of
her
purpose
;
and
,
believing
that
useful
aid
might
still
be
obtained
from
Andy
Gowran
,
and
,
perhaps
,
prudently
anxious
to
get
value
in
return
for
the
cost
of
the
journey
up
from
Ayrshire
<EOS>
,
she
made
the
man
promise
to
return
to
her
on
the
following
morning
.
   
<EOS>
"
Let
It
Be
As
Though
It
Had
Never
Been
"
 
Between
her
son
,
and
her
married
daughter
,
and
Lucy
Morris
,
poor
Lady
Fawn
's
life
had
become
a
burthen
to
her
.
<EOS>
Everything
was
astray
,
and
there
was
no
happiness
or
tranquillity
at
Fawn
Court
.
<EOS>
Of
all
simply
human
creeds
<EOS>
the
strongest
existing
creed
for
the
present
in
the
minds
of
the
Fawn
ladies
was
that
which
had
reference
to
the
general
iniquity
of
Lizzie
Eustace
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
the
cause
of
all
these
sorrows
,
and
she
was
hated
so
much
the
more
because
she
had
not
been
proved
to
be
iniquitous
before
all
the
world
.
<EOS>
There
had
been
a
time
when
it
seemed
to
be
admitted
that
she
was
so
wicked
in
keeping
the
diamonds
in
opposition
to
the
continued
demands
made
for
them
by
Mr.
Camperdown
,
that
all
people
would
be
justified
in
dropping
her
,
and
Lord
Fawn
among
the
number
.
<EOS>
But
since
the
two
robberies
,
public
opinion
had
veered
round
three
or
four
points
in
Lizzie
's
favour
,
and
people
were
beginning
to
say
that
she
had
been
ill
-
used
.
<EOS>
Then
had
come
Mrs.
Hittaway
's
evidence
as
to
Lizzie
's
wicked
doings
down
in
Scotland
,
 
the
wicked
doings
which
Andy
Gowran
had
described
with
a
vehemence
so
terribly
moral
;
and
that
which
had
been
at
first
,
as
it
were
,
added
to
the
diamonds
,
as
a
supplementary
weight
thrown
into
the
scale
,
so
that
Lizzie
's
iniquities
might
bring
her
absolutely
to
the
ground
,
had
gradually
assumed
the
position
of
being
the
first
charge
against
her
.
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
had
felt
no
aversion
to
discussing
the
diamonds
.
<EOS>
When
Lizzie
was
called
a
"
thief
,
"
and
a
"
robber
,
"
and
a
"
swindler
"
by
one
or
another
of
the
ladies
of
the
family
,
 
who
,
in
using
those
strong
terms
,
whispered
the
words
as
ladies
are
wo
nt
to
do
when
they
desire
to
lessen
the
impropriety
of
the
strength
of
their
language
by
the
gentleness
of
the
tone
in
which
the
words
are
spoken
,
 
when
Lizzie
was
thus
described
in
Lady
Fawn
's
hearing
in
her
own
house
,
she
had
felt
no
repugnance
to
it
.
<EOS>
It
was
well
that
the
fact
should
be
known
,
so
that
everybody
might
be
aware
that
her
son
was
doing
right
in
refusing
to
marry
<EOS>
so
wicked
a
lady
.
<EOS>
But
when
the
other
thing
was
added
to
it
;
when
the
story
was
told
of
what
Mr.
Gowran
had
seen
among
the
rocks
,
and
when
gradually
that
became
the
special
crime
which
was
to
justify
her
son
in
dropping
the
lady
's
acquaintance
,
then
Lady
Fawn
became
very
unhappy
,
and
found
the
subject
to
be
,
as
Mrs.
Hittaway
had
described
it
,
very
distasteful
.
  
<EOS>
And
this
trouble
hit
Lucy
Morris
as
hard
as
it
did
Lord
Fawn
.
<EOS>
If
Lizzie
Eustace
was
unfit
to
marry
Lord
Fawn
because
of
these
things
,
then
was
Frank
Greystock
not
only
unfit
to
marry
Lucy
,
but
most
unlikely
to
do
so
,
whether
fit
or
unfit
.
<EOS>
For
a
week
or
two
Lady
Fawn
had
allowed
herself
to
share
Lucy
's
joy
,
and
to
believe
that
Mr.
Greystock
would
prove
himself
true
to
the
girl
whose
heart
he
had
made
all
his
own
;
 
but
she
had
soon
learned
to
distrust
the
young
member
of
Parliament
who
was
always
behaving
insolently
to
her
son
,
who
spent
his
holidays
down
with
Lizzie
Eustace
,
who
never
visited
and
rarely
wrote
to
the
girl
he
had
promised
to
marry
,
and
as
to
whom
all
the
world
agreed
in
saying
that
he
was
far
too
much
in
debt
to
marry
any
woman
who
had
not
means
to
help
him
.
<EOS>
It
was
all
sorrow
and
vexation
together
;
and
yet
when
her
married
daughter
would
press
the
subject
upon
her
,
and
demand
her
co
-
operation
,
she
had
no
power
of
escaping
.
<EOS>
"
Mamma
,
"
Mrs.
Hittaway
had
said
,
"
Lady
Glencora
Palliser
has
been
with
her
,
and
everybody
is
taking
her
up
,
and
if
her
conduct
down
in
Scotland
is
n't
proved
,
Frederic
will
be
made
to
marry
her
.
"
<EOS>
"
But
what
can
I
do
,
my
dear
?
"
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
had
asked
,
almost
in
tears
.
"
<EOS>
Insist
that
Frederic
shall
know
the
whole
truth
,
"
replied
Mrs.
Hittaway
with
energy
.
<EOS>
"
Of
course
,
it
is
very
disagreeable
.
<EOS>
Nobody
can
feel
it
more
than
I
do
.
<EOS>
It
is
horrible
to
have
to
talk
about
such
things
,
 
and
to
think
of
them
.
"
<EOS>
"
Indeed
it
is
,
Clara
,
 
very
horrible
.
"
<EOS>
"
But
anything
,
mamma
,
is
better
than
that
Frederic
should
be
allowed
to
marry
such
a
woman
as
that
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
proved
to
him
 
<EOS>
how
unfit
she
is
to
be
his
wife
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
With
the
view
of
carrying
out
this
intention
,
Mrs.
Hittaway
had
,
as
we
have
seen
,
received
Andy
Gowran
at
her
own
house
;
and
with
the
same
view
she
took
Andy
Gowran
the
following
morning
down
to
Richmond
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Hittaway
,
and
her
mother
,
and
Andy
were
closeted
together
for
half
an
hour
,
and
Lady
Fawn
suffered
grievously
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
had
found
that
he
could
n't
hear
the
story
,
and
he
had
not
heard
it
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
strong
enough
to
escape
,
and
had
,
upon
the
whole
,
got
the
best
of
it
in
the
slight
skirmish
which
had
taken
place
between
him
and
the
Scotchman
;
but
poor
old
Lady
Fawn
could
not
escape
.
<EOS>
Andy
was
allowed
to
be
eloquent
,
and
the
whole
story
was
told
to
her
,
though
she
would
almost
sooner
have
been
flogged
at
a
cart
's
tail
than
have
heard
it
.
<EOS>
Then
"
rafrashments
"
were
administered
to
Andy
of
a
nature
which
made
him
prefer
Fawn
Court
to
Warwick
Square
,
and
he
was
told
that
he
might
go
back
to
Portray
as
soon
as
he
pleased
.
  
<EOS>
When
he
was
gone
,
Mrs.
Hittaway
opened
her
mind
to
her
mother
altogether
.
<EOS>
"
The
truth
is
,
mamma
,
that
Frederic
will
marry
her
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
But
why
?
<EOS>
I
thought
that
he
had
declared
that
he
would
give
it
up
.
<EOS>
I
thought
that
he
had
said
so
to
herself
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
of
that
,
if
he
retracts
what
he
said
?
<EOS>
He
is
so
weak
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
Palliser
has
made
him
promise
to
go
and
see
her
;
and
he
is
to
go
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
He
is
there
now
,
probably
,
 
at
this
very
moment
.
<EOS>
If
he
had
been
firm
,
the
thing
was
done
.
<EOS>
After
all
that
has
taken
place
,
nobody
would
ever
have
supposed
that
his
engagement
need
go
for
anything
.
<EOS>
But
what
can
he
say
to
her
now
that
he
is
with
her
,
except
just
do
the
mischief
all
over
again
?
<EOS>
I
call
it
quite
wicked
in
that
woman
's
interfering
.
<EOS>
I
do
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
She
's
a
nasty
,
insolent
,
impertinent
creature
;
 
<EOS>
that
's
what
she
is
!
<EOS>
After
all
the
trouble
I
've
taken
,
she
comes
and
undoes
it
all
with
one
word
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
can
we
do
,
Clara
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
;
 
I
do
believe
that
if
Frederic
could
be
made
to
act
as
he
ought
to
do
,
just
for
a
while
,
she
would
marry
her
cousin
,
Mr.
Greystock
,
and
then
there
would
be
an
end
of
it
altogether
.
<EOS>
I
really
think
that
she
likes
him
best
,
and
from
all
that
I
can
hear
,
she
would
take
him
now
,
if
Frederic
would
only
keep
out
of
the
way
.
<EOS>
As
for
him
,
of
course
he
is
doing
his
very
best
to
get
her
.
<EOS>
He
has
not
one
shilling
to
rub
against
another
,
and
is
over
head
and
ears
in
debt
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Poor
Lucy
!
"
ejaculated
Lady
Fawn
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
;
 
yes
;
but
really
that
is
a
matter
of
course
.
<EOS>
I
always
thought
,
mamma
,
that
you
and
Amelia
were
a
little
wrong
to
coax
her
up
in
that
belief
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
my
dear
,
the
man
proposed
for
her
in
the
plainest
possible
manner
.
<EOS>
I
saw
his
letter
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
No
doubt
;
 
men
do
propose
.
<EOS>
We
all
know
that
.
<EOS>
I
'm
sure
I
do
n't
know
what
they
get
by
it
,
but
I
suppose
it
amuses
them
.
<EOS>
There
used
to
be
a
sort
of
feeling
that
if
a
man
behaved
badly
something
would
be
done
to
him
;
but
that
's
all
over
now
.
<EOS>
A
man
may
propose
to
whom
he
likes
,
and
if
he
chooses
to
say
afterwards
that
it
does
n't
mean
anything
,
there
's
nothing
in
the
world
to
bring
him
to
book
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
very
hard
,
"
said
the
elder
lady
,
of
whom
everybody
said
that
she
did
not
understand
the
world
as
well
as
her
daughter
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
girls
,
 
they
all
know
that
it
is
so
,
and
I
suppose
it
comes
to
the
same
thing
in
the
long
run
.
<EOS>
The
men
have
to
marry
,
and
what
one
girl
loses
another
girl
gets
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>

It
will
kill
Lucy

Girls

Saying
that
it
will
kill
her
wo
n't
change
the
man
's
nature

<EOS>
It
was
n't
to
be
expected
that
such
a
man
as
Frank
Greystock
,
in
debt
,
and
in
Parliament
,
and
going
to
all
the
best
houses
,
should
marry
your
governess
.
<EOS>
What
was
he
to
get
by
it
?
<EOS>
That
's
what
I
want
to
know

<EOS>
"
I
suppose
he
loved
her
.

<EOS>
"
Laws
,
mamma
,
how
antediluvian
you
are
!
<EOS>
No
doubt
he
did
like
her
,
 
after
his
fashion
;
though
what
he
saw
in
her
,
I
never
could
tell
.
<EOS>
I
think
Miss
Morris
would
make
a
very
nice
wife
for
a
country
clergyman
who
did
n't
care
how
poor
things
were
.
<EOS>
But
she
has
no
style
;
 
and
as
far
as
I
can
see
,
she
has
no
beauty
.
<EOS>
Why
should
such
a
man
as
Frank
Greystock
tie
himself
by
the
leg
for
ever
to
such
a
girl
as
that
?
<EOS>
But
,
mamma
,
he
does
n't
mean
to
marry
Lucy
Morris

<EOS>
Would
he
have
been
going
on
in
that
way
with
his
cousin
down
in
Scotland
<EOS>
had
he
meant
it
?
<EOS>
He
means
nothing
of
the
kind
.
<EOS>
He
means
to
marry
Lady
Eustace
's
income
if
he
can
get
it
;
 
and
she
would
marry
him
before
the
summer
if
only
we
could
keep
Frederic
away
from
her

Mrs.

demanded
from

urgent

impressing
upon
him

necessity
of
waiting
,
in
order
that
he
might
see
how
false
Lady
Eustace
was
to
him
;
and
also
that
she
should
teach
Lucy
Morris
how
vain
were
all
her
hopes
.
<EOS>
If
Lucy
Morris
would
withdraw
her
claims
altogether
the
thing
might
probably
be
more
quickly
and
more
surely
managed
.
<EOS>
If
Lucy
could
be
induced
to
tell
Frank
that
she
withdrew
her
claim
,
and
that
she
saw
how
impossible
it
was
that
they
should
ever
be
man
and
wife
,
then
,
 
so
argued
Mrs.
Hittaway
,
 
Frank
would
at
once
throw
himself
at
his
cousin
's
feet
,
and
all
the
difficulty
would
be
over
.
<EOS>
The
abominable
,
unjustifiable
,
and
insolent
interference
of
Lady
Glencora
just
at
the
present
moment
would
be
the
means
of
undoing
all
the
good
that
had
been
done
,
unless
it
could
be
neutralised
by
some
such
activity
as
this
.
<EOS>
The
necklace
had
absolutely
faded
away
into
nothing
.
<EOS>
The
sly
creature
was
almost
becoming
a
heroine
on
the
strength
of
the
necklace
.
<EOS>
The
very
mystery
with
which
the
robberies
were
pervaded
was
acting
in
her
favour
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
would
absolutely
be
made
to
marry
her
,
 
forced
into
it
by
Lady
Glencora
and
that
set
,
 
unless
the
love
affair
between
her
and
her
cousin
,
of
which
Andy
Gowran
was
able
to
give
such
sufficient
testimony
,
could
in
some
way
be
made
available
to
prevent
it
.
  
<EOS>
The
theory
of
life
and
system
on
which
social
matters
should
be
managed
,
as
displayed
by
her
married
daughter
,
was
very
painful
to
poor
old
Lady
Fawn
.
<EOS>
When
she
was
told
that
under
the
new
order
of
things
promises
from
gentlemen
were
not
to
be
looked
upon
as
binding
,
that
love
was
to
go
for
nothing
,
that
girls
were
to
be
made
contented
by
being
told
that
when
one
lover
was
lost
another
could
be
found
,
she
was
very
unhappy
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
disbelieve
it
all
,
and
throw
herself
back
upon
her
faith
in
virtue
,
constancy
,
and
honesty
.
<EOS>
She
rather
thought
that
things
had
changed
for
the
worse
since
she
was
young
,
and
that
promises
were
not
now
as
binding
as
they
used
to
be
.
<EOS>
She
herself
had
married
into
a
Liberal
family
,
had
a
Liberal
son
,
and
would
have
called
herself
a
Liberal
;
but
she
could
not
fail
to
hear
from
others
,
her
neighbours
,
that
the
English
manners
,
and
English
principles
,
and
English
society
were
all
going
to
destruction
in
consequence
of
the
so
-
called
liberality
of
the
age
.
<EOS>
Gentlemen
,
she
thought
,
certainly
did
do
things
which
gentlemen
would
not
have
done
forty
years
ago
;
and
as
for
ladies
,
 
they
,
doubtless
,
were
changed
altogether
.
<EOS>
Most
assuredly
she
could
not
have
brought
an
Andy
Gowran
to
her
mother
to
tell
such
tales
in
their
joint
presence
as
this
man
had
told
!
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Hittaway
had
ridiculed
her
for
saying
that
poor
Lucy
would
die
when
forced
to
give
up
her
lover
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Hittaway
had
spoken
of
the
necessity
of
breaking
up
that
engagement
without
a
word
of
anger
against
Frank
Greystock
.
<EOS>
According
to
Mrs.
Hittaway
's
views
Frank
Greystock
had
amused
himself
in
the
most
natural
way
in
the
world
when
he
asked
Lucy
to
be
his
wife
.
<EOS>
A
governess
like
Lucy
had
been
quite
foolish
to
expect
that
such
a
man
as
Greystock
was
in
earnest
.
<EOS>
Of
course
she
must
give
up
her
lover
;
and
if
there
must
be
blame
,
she
must
blame
herself
for
her
folly
!
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
Lady
Fawn
was
so
soft
-
hearted
that
she
believed
that
the
sorrow
would
crush
Lucy
,
even
if
it
did
not
kill
her
.
  
<EOS>
But
not
the
less
was
it
her
duty
to
tell
Lucy
what
she
thought
to
be
the
truth
.
<EOS>
The
story
of
what
had
occurred
among
the
rocks
at
Portray
was
very
disagreeable
,
but
she
believed
it
to
be
true
.
<EOS>
The
man
had
been
making
love
to
his
cousin
after
his
engagement
to
Lucy
.
<EOS>
And
then
,
was
it
not
quite
manifest
that
he
was
neglecting
poor
Lucy
in
every
way
?
<EOS>
He
had
not
seen
her
for
nearly
six
months
.
<EOS>
Had
he
intended
to
marry
her
,
would
he
not
have
found
a
home
for
her
at
the
deanery
?
<EOS>
Did
he
in
any
respect
treat
her
as
he
would
treat
the
girl
whom
he
intended
to
marry
?
<EOS>
Putting
all
these
things
together
,
Lady
Fawn
thought
that
she
saw
that
Lucy
's
case
was
hopeless
;
 
and
,
so
thinking
,
wrote
to
her
the
following
letter
:
    
Fawn
Court
,
3rd
March
,
18
 
.
  
<EOS>
DEAREST
LUCY
,
  
<EOS>
I
have
so
much
to
say
to
you
that
I
did
think
of
getting
Lady
Linlithgow
to
let
you
come
to
us
here
for
a
day
,
but
I
believe
it
will
perhaps
be
better
that
I
should
write
.
<EOS>
I
think
you
leave
Lady
Linlithgow
after
the
first
week
in
April
,
and
it
is
quite
necessary
that
you
should
come
to
some
fixed
arrangement
as
to
the
future
.
<EOS>
If
that
were
all
,
there
need
not
be
any
trouble
,
as
you
will
come
here
,
of
course
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
this
is
your
natural
home
,
as
we
all
feel
;
and
I
must
say
that
we
have
missed
you
most
terribly
since
you
went
,
 
not
only
for
Cecilia
and
Nina
,
but
for
all
of
us
.
<EOS>
And
I
do
n't
know
that
I
should
write
at
all
if
it
was
n't
for
something
else
,
that
must
be
said
sooner
or
later
;
 
<EOS>
because
,
as
to
your
coming
here
in
April
,
that
is
so
much
a
matter
of
course
.
<EOS>
The
only
mistake
was
,
that
you
should
ever
have
gone
away
.
<EOS>
So
we
shall
expect
you
here
on
whatever
day
you
may
arrange
with
Lady
Linlithgow
as
to
leaving
her
.
  
<EOS>
The
poor
,
dear
lady
went
on
repeating
her
affectionate
invitation
,
because
of
the
difficulty
she
encountered
in
finding
words
with
which
to
give
the
cruel
counsel
which
she
thought
that
it
was
her
duty
to
offer
.
  
<EOS>
And
now
,
dearest
Lucy
,
I
must
say
what
I
believe
to
be
the
truth
about
Mr.
Greystock
.
<EOS>
I
think
that
you
should
teach
yourself
to
forget
him
,
 
or
,
at
any
rate
,
that
you
should
teach
yourself
to
forget
the
offer
which
he
made
to
you
last
autumn
.
<EOS>
Whether
he
was
or
was
not
in
earnest
then
,
I
think
that
he
has
now
determined
to
forget
it
.
<EOS>
I
fear
there
is
no
doubt
that
he
has
been
making
love
to
his
cousin
,
Lady
Eustace
.
<EOS>
You
well
know
that
I
should
not
mention
such
a
thing
,
if
I
had
not
the
strongest
possible
grounds
to
convince
me
that
I
ought
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
But
,
independent
of
this
,
his
conduct
to
you
during
the
last
six
months
has
been
such
as
to
make
us
all
feel
sure
that
the
engagement
is
distasteful
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
has
probably
found
himself
so
placed
that
he
can
not
marry
without
money
,
and
has
wanted
the
firmness
,
or
perhaps
you
will
say
the
hardness
of
heart
,
to
say
so
openly
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
of
this
,
and
so
is
Amelia
,
that
it
will
be
better
for
you
to
give
the
matter
up
altogether
,
and
to
come
here
and
recover
the
blow
among
friends
who
will
be
as
kind
to
you
as
possible
.
<EOS>
I
know
all
that
you
will
feel
,
and
you
have
my
fullest
sympathy
;
but
even
such
sorrows
as
that
are
cured
by
time
,
and
by
the
mercy
of
God
,
which
is
not
only
infinite
,
but
all
-
powerful
.
  
<EOS>
Your
most
affectionate
friend
,
  
C.
FAWN
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
,
when
she
had
written
her
letter
,
discussed
it
with
Amelia
,
and
the
two
together
agreed
that
Lucy
would
never
surmount
the
ill
effects
of
the
blow
which
was
thus
prophesied
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
to
saying
it
will
kill
her
,
mamma
,
"
said
Amelia
,
"
I
do
n't
believe
in
that
.
<EOS>
If
I
were
to
break
my
leg
,
the
accident
might
shorten
my
life
,
and
this
may
shorten
hers
.
<EOS>
It
wo
n't
kill
her
in
any
other
way
.
<EOS>
But
it
will
alter
her
altogether
.
<EOS>
Nobody
ever
used
to
make
herself
happy
so
easily
as
Lucy
Morris
;
but
all
that
will
be
gone
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
When
Lucy
received
the
letter
,
the
immediate
effect
upon
her
,
the
effect
which
came
from
the
first
reading
of
it
,
was
not
very
great
.
<EOS>
She
succeeded
for
some
half
-
hour
in
putting
it
aside
,
as
referring
to
a
subject
on
which
she
had
quite
made
up
her
mind
in
a
direction
contrary
to
that
indicated
by
her
correspondent
's
advice
.
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
told
her
that
her
lover
intended
to
be
false
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
had
thought
the
matter
over
very
carefully
within
the
last
day
or
two
,
and
had
altogether
made
up
her
mind
that
she
would
continue
to
trust
her
lover
.
<EOS>
She
had
abstained
from
sending
to
him
the
letter
which
she
had
written
,
and
had
abstained
on
that
resolution
.
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
,
of
course
,
was
as
kind
and
friendly
as
a
friend
could
be
.
<EOS>
She
loved
Lady
Fawn
dearly
.
<EOS>
But
she
was
not
bound
to
think
Lady
Fawn
right
,
and
in
this
instance
she
did
not
think
Lady
Fawn
right
.
<EOS>
So
she
folded
up
the
letter
and
put
it
in
her
pocket
.
  
<EOS>
But
by
putting
the
letter
into
her
pocket
she
could
not
put
it
out
of
her
mind
.
<EOS>
Though
she
had
resolved
,
of
what
use
to
her
was
a
resolution
in
which
she
could
not
trust
?
<EOS>
Day
had
passed
by
after
day
,
week
after
week
,
and
month
after
month
,
and
her
very
soul
within
her
had
become
sad
for
want
of
seeing
this
man
,
who
was
living
almost
in
the
next
street
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
was
ashamed
to
own
to
herself
<EOS>
how
many
hours
she
had
sat
at
the
window
,
thinking
that
,
perhaps
,
he
might
walk
before
the
house
in
which
he
knew
that
she
was
immured
.
<EOS>
And
,
even
had
it
been
impossible
that
he
should
come
to
her
<EOS>
,
the
post
was
open
to
him
.
<EOS>
She
had
scorned
to
write
to
him
oftener
than
he
would
write
to
her
,
and
now
their
correspondence
had
dwindled
almost
to
nothing
.
<EOS>
He
knew
as
well
as
did
Lady
Fawn
when
the
period
of
her
incarceration
in
Lady
Linlithgow
's
dungeon
would
come
to
an
end
;
and
he
knew
,
too
,
how
great
had
been
her
hope
that
she
might
be
accepted
as
a
guest
at
the
deanery
when
that
period
should
arrive
.
<EOS>
He
knew
that
she
must
look
for
a
new
home
,
unless
he
would
tell
her
where
she
should
live
.
<EOS>
Was
it
likely
,
 
was
it
possible
,
that
he
should
be
silent
so
long
if
he
still
intended
to
make
her
his
wife
?
<EOS>
No
doubt
he
had
come
to
remember
his
debts
,
to
remember
his
ambition
,
to
think
of
his
cousin
's
wealth
,
 
and
to
think
also
of
his
cousin
's
beauty
.
<EOS>
What
right
had
she
ever
had
to
hope
for
such
a
position
as
that
of
his
wife
,
 
she
who
had
neither
money
nor
beauty
,
 
she
who
had
nothing
to
give
him
in
return
for
his
name
and
the
shelter
of
his
house
beyond
her
mind
and
her
heart
?
<EOS>
As
she
thought
of
it
all
,
she
looked
down
upon
her
faded
grey
frock
,
and
stood
up
that
she
might
glance
at
her
features
in
the
glass
;
and
she
saw
how
small
she
was
and
insignificant
,
and
reminded
herself
that
all
she
had
in
the
world
was
a
few
pounds
which
she
had
saved
and
was
still
saving
in
order
that
she
might
go
to
him
with
decent
clothes
upon
her
back
.
<EOS>
Was
it
reasonable
that
she
should
expect
it
?
  
<EOS>
But
why
had
he
come
to
her
and
made
her
thus
wretched
?
<EOS>
She
could
acknowledge
to
herself
that
she
had
been
foolish
,
vain
,
utterly
ignorant
of
her
own
value
in
venturing
to
hope
;
perhaps
unmaidenly
in
allowing
it
to
be
seen
that
she
had
hoped
;
 
but
what
was
he
in
having
first
exalted
her
before
all
her
friends
,
and
then
abasing
her
so
terribly
and
bringing
her
to
such
utter
shipwreck
?
<EOS>
From
spoken
or
written
reproaches
she
could
,
of
course
,
abstain
.
<EOS>
She
would
neither
write
nor
speak
any
;
 
but
from
unuttered
reproaches
how
could
she
abstain
?
<EOS>
She
had
called
him
a
traitor
once
in
playful
,
loving
irony
,
during
those
few
hours
in
which
her
love
had
been
to
her
a
luxury
that
she
could
enjoy
.
<EOS>
But
now
he
was
a
traitor
indeed
.
<EOS>
Had
he
left
her
alone
<EOS>
she
would
have
loved
him
in
silence
,
and
not
have
been
wretched
in
her
love
.
<EOS>
She
would
,
she
knew
,
in
that
case
,
have
had
vigour
enough
and
sufficient
strength
of
character
to
bear
her
burthen
without
outward
signs
of
suffering
,
without
any
inward
suffering
that
would
have
disturbed
the
current
of
her
life
.
<EOS>
But
now
everything
was
over
with
her
.
<EOS>
She
had
no
thought
of
dying
,
but
her
future
life
was
a
blank
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
She
came
down
-
stairs
to
sit
at
lunch
with
Lady
Linlithgow
,
and
the
old
woman
did
not
perceive
that
anything
was
amiss
with
her
companion
.
<EOS>
Further
news
had
been
heard
of
Lizzie
Eustace
,
and
of
Lord
Fawn
,
and
of
the
robberies
,
and
the
countess
declared
how
she
had
read
in
the
newspaper
that
one
man
was
already
in
custody
for
the
burglary
at
the
house
in
Hertford
Street
.
<EOS>
From
that
subject
she
went
on
to
tidings
which
had
reached
her
from
her
old
friend
Lady
Clantantram
that
the
Fawn
marriage
was
on
again
.
"
<EOS>
Not
that
I
believe
it
,
my
dear
;
because
I
think
that
Mr.
Greystock
has
made
it
quite
safe
in
that
quarter
.
<EOS>
"
All
this
Lucy
heard
,
and
never
showed
by
a
single
sign
,
or
by
a
motion
of
a
muscle
,
that
she
was
in
pain
.
<EOS>
Then
Lady
Linlithgow
asked
her
what
she
meant
to
do
after
the
5th
of
April
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
see
at
all
why
you
should
n't
stay
here
,
if
you
like
it
,
Miss
Morris
;
 
that
is
,
if
you
have
abandoned
the
stupid
idea
of
an
engagement
with
Frank
Greystock
.
"
<EOS>
Lucy
smiled
,
and
even
thanked
the
countess
,
and
said
that
she
had
made
up
her
mind
to
go
back
to
Richmond
for
a
month
or
two
,
till
she
could
get
another
engagement
as
a
governess
.
<EOS>
Then
she
returned
to
her
room
and
sat
again
at
her
window
,
looking
out
upon
the
street
.
  
<EOS>
What
did
it
matter
now
where
she
went
?
<EOS>
And
yet
she
must
go
somewhere
,
and
do
something
.
<EOS>
There
remained
to
her
the
wearisome
possession
of
herself
,
and
while
she
lived
she
must
eat
,
and
have
clothes
,
and
require
shelter
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
dawdle
out
a
bitter
existence
under
Lady
Fawn
's
roof
,
eating
the
bread
of
charity
,
hanging
about
the
rooms
and
shrubberies
useless
and
idle
.
<EOS>
How
bitter
to
her
was
that
possession
of
herself
,
as
she
felt
that
there
was
nothing
good
to
be
done
with
the
thing
so
possessed
!
<EOS>
She
doubted
even
whether
ever
again
she
could
become
serviceable
as
a
governess
,
and
whether
the
energy
would
be
left
to
her
of
earning
her
bread
by
teaching
adequately
the
few
things
that
she
knew
.
<EOS>
But
she
must
make
the
attempt
,
 
and
must
go
on
making
it
,
till
God
in
his
mercy
should
take
her
to
himself
.
  
<EOS>
And
yet
but
a
few
months
since
life
had
been
so
sweet
to
her
!
<EOS>
As
she
felt
this
she
was
not
thinking
of
those
short
days
of
excited
,
feverish
bliss
in
which
she
had
believed
that
all
the
good
things
of
the
world
were
to
be
showered
into
her
lap
;
but
of
previous
years
in
which
everything
had
been
with
her
as
it
was
now
,
 
with
the
one
exception
that
she
had
not
then
been
deceived
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
full
of
smiles
,
and
humour
,
and
mirth
,
absolutely
happy
among
her
friends
,
though
conscious
of
the
necessity
of
earning
her
bread
by
the
exercise
of
a
most
precarious
profession
,
 
while
elated
by
no
hope
.
<EOS>
Though
she
had
loved
the
man
and
had
been
hopeless
,
she
was
happy
.
<EOS>
But
now
,
surely
,
of
all
maidens
and
of
all
women
,
she
was
the
most
forlorn
.
  
<EOS>
Having
once
acceded
to
the
truth
of
Lady
Fawn
's
views
,
she
abandoned
all
hope
.
<EOS>
Everybody
said
so
,
and
it
was
so
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
word
from
any
side
to
encourage
her
.
<EOS>
The
thing
was
done
and
over
,
and
she
would
never
mention
his
name
again
.
<EOS>
She
would
simply
beg
of
all
the
Fawns
that
no
allusion
might
be
made
to
him
in
her
presence
.
<EOS>
She
would
never
blame
him
,
and
certainly
she
would
never
praise
him
.
<EOS>
As
far
as
she
could
rule
her
tongue
,
she
would
never
have
his
name
upon
her
lips
again
.
  
<EOS>
She
thought
for
a
time
that
she
would
send
the
letter
which
she
had
already
written
.
<EOS>
Any
other
letter
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
write
.
<EOS>
Even
to
think
of
him
was
an
agony
to
her
;
but
to
communicate
her
thoughts
to
him
was
worse
than
agony
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
almost
madness
.
<EOS>
What
need
was
there
for
any
letter
?
<EOS>
If
the
thing
was
done
,
it
was
done
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
there
remained
with
her
,
 
staying
by
her
without
her
own
knowledge
,
some
faint
spark
of
hope
,
that
even
yet
he
might
return
to
her
.
<EOS>
At
last
she
resolved
that
there
should
be
no
letter
,
and
she
destroyed
that
which
she
had
written
.
  
<EOS>
But
she
did
write
a
note
to
Lady
Fawn
,
in
which
she
gratefully
accepted
her
old
friend
's
kindness
till
such
time
as
she
could
"
find
a
place
.
"
<EOS>
"
As
to
that
other
subject
,
"
she
said
,
"
I
know
that
you
are
right
.
<EOS>
Please
let
it
all
be
as
though
it
had
never
been
.

Lizzie
's
Great
Friend
 
<EOS>
The
Saturday
morning
came
at
last
for
which
Lord
Fawn
had
made
his
appointment
with
Lizzie
,
and
a
very
important
day
it
was
in
Hertford
Street
,
 
chiefly
on
account
of
his
lordship
's
visit
,
but
also
in
respect
to
other
events
which
crowded
themselves
into
the
day
.
<EOS>
In
the
telling
of
our
tale
,
we
have
gone
a
little
in
advance
of
this
,
as
it
was
not
till
the
subsequent
Monday
that
Lady
Linlithgow
read
in
the
newspaper
,
and
told
Lucy
,
how
a
man
had
been
arrested
on
account
of
the
robbery
.
<EOS>
Early
on
the
Saturday
morning
Sir
Griffin
Tewett
was
in
Hertford
Street
,
and
,
as
Lizzie
afterwards
understood
,
there
was
a
terrible
scene
between
both
him
and
Lucinda
and
him
and
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
<EOS>
She
saw
nothing
of
it
herself
,
but
Mrs.
Carbuncle
brought
her
the
tidings
.
<EOS>
For
the
last
few
days
Mrs.
Carbuncle
had
been
very
affectionate
in
her
manner
to
Lizzie
,
thereby
showing
a
great
change
;
for
during
nearly
the
whole
of
February
the
lady
,
who
in
fact
owned
the
house
,
had
hardly
been
courteous
to
her
remunerative
guest
,
expressing
more
than
once
a
hint
that
the
arrangement
which
had
brought
them
together
had
better
come
to
an
end
.
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
Lady
Eustace
,
"
Mrs.
Carbuncle
had
once
said
,
"
the
trouble
about
these
robberies
is
almost
too
much
for
me
.
"
<EOS>
Lizzie
,
who
was
ill
at
the
time
,
and
still
trembling
with
constant
fear
on
account
of
the
lost
diamonds
,
had
taken
advantage
of
her
sick
condition
,
and
declined
to
argue
the
question
of
her
removal
.
<EOS>
Now
she
was
supposed
to
be
convalescent
,
but
Mrs.
Carbuncle
had
returned
to
her
former
ways
of
affection
.
<EOS>
No
doubt
there
was
cause
for
this
,
 
cause
that
was
patent
to
Lizzie
herself
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
Palliser
had
called
,
 
which
thing
alone
was
felt
by
Lizzie
to
alter
her
position
altogether
.
<EOS>
And
then
,
though
her
diamonds
were
gone
,
and
though
the
thieves
who
had
stolen
them
were
undoubtedly
aware
of
her
secret
as
to
the
first
robbery
,
though
she
had
herself
told
that
secret
to
Lord
George
,
whom
she
had
not
seen
since
she
had
done
so
,
 
in
spite
of
all
these
causes
for
trouble
,
she
had
of
late
gradually
found
herself
to
be
emerging
from
the
state
of
despondency
into
which
she
had
fallen
while
the
diamonds
were
in
her
own
custody
.
<EOS>
She
knew
that
she
was
regaining
her
ascendancy
;
and
,
therefore
,
when
Mrs.
Carbuncle
came
to
tell
her
of
the
grievous
things
which
had
been
said
down
-
stairs
between
Sir
Griffin
and
his
mistress
,
and
to
consult
her
as
to
the
future
,
Lizzie
was
not
surprised
.
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
the
meaning
of
it
is
that
the
match
must
be
off
,
"
said
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
dear
,
no
;
 
pray
do
n't
say
anything
so
horrid
after
all
that
I
have
gone
through
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
suggest
anything
of
that
kind
to
Lucinda
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
surely
after
what
you
've
told
me
now
,
he
'll
never
come
here
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
yes
,
he
will
.
<EOS>
There
's
no
danger
about
his
coming
back
.
<EOS>
It
's
only
a
sort
of
a
way
he
has
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
very
disagreeable
way
,
"
said
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
doubt
,
Lady
Eustace
.
<EOS>
But
then
you
know
you
ca
n't
have
it
all
sweet
.
<EOS>
There
must
be
some
things
disagreeable
.
<EOS>
As
far
as
I
can
learn
,
the
property
will
be
all
right
after
a
few
years
,
 
and
it
is
absolutely
indispensable
that
Lucinda
should
do
something
.
<EOS>
She
has
accepted
him
,
and
she
must
go
on
with
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
seems
to
me
to
be
very
unhappy
,
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
was
always
her
way
.
<EOS>
She
was
never
gay
and
cheery
like
other
girls
.
<EOS>
I
have
never
known
her
once
to
be
what
you
would
call
happy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
likes
hunting
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
 
because
she
can
gallop
away
out
of
herself
.
<EOS>
I
have
done
all
I
can
for
her
,
and
she
must
go
on
with
the
marriage
now
.
<EOS>
As
for
going
back
,
it
is
out
of
the
question
.
<EOS>
The
truth
is
,
we
could
n't
afford
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
you
must
keep
him
in
a
better
humour
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
so
much
afraid
about
him
;
but
,
dear
Lady
Eustace
,
we
want
you
to
help
us
a
little
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
can
I
help
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
can
,
certainly
.
<EOS>
Could
you
lend
me
two
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
,
just
for
six
weeks
?
<EOS>
"
Lizzie
's
face
fell
and
her
eyes
became
very
serious
in
their
aspect
.
<EOS>
Two
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
!
<EOS>
"
You
know
you
would
have
ample
security
.
<EOS>
You
need
not
give
Lucinda
her
present
till
I
've
paid
you
,
and
that
will
be
forty
-
five
pounds
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thirty
-
five
,
"
said
Lizzie
with
angry
decision
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
thought
we
agreed
upon
forty
-
five
when
we
settled
about
the
servants
"
liveries
;
 
and
then
you
can
let
the
man
at
the
stables
know
that
I
am
to
pay
for
the
carriage
and
horses
.
<EOS>
You
would
n't
be
out
of
the
money
hardly
above
a
week
or
so
,
and
it
might
be
the
salvation
of
Lucinda
just
at
present
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
do
n't
you
ask
Lord
George
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ask
Lord
George
!
<EOS>
He
has
n't
got
it
.
<EOS>
It
's
much
more
likely
that
he
should
ask
me
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
what
's
come
to
Lord
George
this
last
month
past
.
<EOS>
I
did
believe
that
you
and
he
were
to
come
together
.
<EOS>
I
think
these
two
robberies
have
upset
him
altogether
.
<EOS>
But
,
dear
Lizzie
;
 
you
can
let
me
have
it
,
ca
n't
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
Lizzie
did
not
at
all
like
the
idea
of
lending
money
,
and
by
no
means
appreciated
the
security
now
offered
to
her
.
<EOS>
It
might
be
very
well
for
her
to
tell
the
man
at
the
stables
that
Mrs.
Carbuncle
would
pay
him
her
bill
,
but
how
would
it
be
with
her
if
Mrs.
Carbuncle
did
not
pay
the
bill
?
<EOS>
And
as
for
her
present
to
Lucinda
,
 
which
was
to
have
been
a
present
,
and
regarded
by
the
future
Lady
Tewett
as
a
voluntary
offering
of
good
-
will
and
affection
,
 
she
was
altogether
averse
to
having
it
disposed
of
in
this
fashion
.
<EOS>
And
yet
she
did
not
like
to
make
an
enemy
of
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
<EOS>
"
I
never
was
so
poor
in
my
life
before
,
 
not
since
I
was
married
,
"
said
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
ca
n't
be
poor
,
dear
Lady
Eustace
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
took
my
money
out
of
my
desk
,
you
know
,
 
ever
so
much
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Forty
-
three
pounds
,
"
said
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
who
was
,
of
course
,
well
instructed
in
all
the
details
of
the
robbery
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
do
n't
suppose
you
can
guess
what
the
autumn
cost
me
at
Portray
.
<EOS>
The
bills
are
only
coming
in
now
,
and
really
they
sometimes
so
frighten
me
that
I
do
n't
know
what
I
shall
do
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
I
have
n't
got
the
money
to
spare
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
'll
have
every
penny
of
it
back
in
six
weeks
,
"
said
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
upon
whose
face
a
glow
of
anger
was
settling
down
.
<EOS>
She
quite
intended
to
make
herself
very
disagreeable
to
her
"
dear
Lady
Eustace
"
or
her
"
dear
Lizzie
"
if
she
did
not
get
what
she
wanted
;
and
she
knew
very
well
how
to
do
it
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
owned
that
Lizzie
was
afraid
of
the
woman
.
<EOS>
It
was
almost
impossible
for
her
not
to
be
afraid
of
the
people
with
whom
she
lived
.
<EOS>
There
were
so
many
things
against
her
;
 
so
many
sources
of
fear
!
<EOS>
"
I
am
quite
sure
you
wo
n't
refuse
me
such
a
trifling
favour
as
this
,
"
said
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
with
the
glow
of
anger
reddening
more
and
more
upon
her
brow
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
I
have
so
much
at
the
bankers
,
"
said
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
'll
let
you
overdraw
,
 
just
as
much
as
you
please
.
<EOS>
If
the
cheque
comes
back
that
will
be
my
look
out
.
<EOS>
"
Lizzie
had
tried
that
game
before
,
and
knew
that
the
bankers
would
allow
her
to
overdraw
.
<EOS>
"
Come
,
be
a
good
friend
and
do
it
at
once
,
"
said
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
I
can
manage
a
hundred
and
fifty
,
"
said
Lizzie
,
trembling
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
fought
hard
for
the
greater
sum
;
but
at
last
consented
to
take
the
less
,
and
the
cheque
was
written
.
  
<EOS>
"
This
,
of
course
,
wo
n't
interfere
with
Lucinda
's
present
,
"
said
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
 
"
as
we
can
make
all
this
right
by
the
horse
and
carriage
account
.
<EOS>
"
To
this
proposition
,
however
,
Lady
Eustace
made
no
answer
.
  
<EOS>
Soon
after
lunch
,
at
which
meal
Miss
Roanoke
did
not
show
herself
,
Lady
Glencora
Palliser
was
announced
,
and
sat
for
about
ten
minutes
in
the
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
She
had
come
,
she
said
,
especially
to
give
the
Duke
of
Omnium
's
compliments
to
Lady
Eustace
,
and
to
express
a
wish
on
the
part
of
the
duke
that
the
lost
diamonds
might
be
recovered
.
<EOS>
"
I
doubt
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
,
"
whether
there
is
any
one
in
England
except
professed
jewellers
who
knows
so
much
about
diamonds
as
his
grace
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Or
who
has
so
many
,
"
said
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
smiling
graciously
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
about
that
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
there
are
family
diamonds
,
though
I
have
never
seen
them
.
<EOS>
But
he
sympathises
with
you
completely
,
Lady
Eustace
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
there
is
hardly
hope
now
of
recovering
them
.
"
<EOS>
Lizzie
smiled
and
shook
her
head
.
<EOS>
"
Is
n't
it
odd
that
they
never
should
have
discovered
the
thieves
?
<EOS>
I
'm
told
they
have
n't
at
all
given
it
up
,
 
<EOS>
only
,
unfortunately
,
they
'll
never
get
back
the
necklace
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
sat
there
for
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
and
then
,
as
she
took
her
leave
,
she
whispered
a
few
words
to
Lizzie
.
"
<EOS>
He
is
to
come
and
see
you
;
 
is
n't
he
?
"
<EOS>
Lizzie
assented
with
a
smile
,
but
without
a
word
.
<EOS>
"
I
hope
it
will
be
all
right
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
,
and
then
she
went
.
  
<EOS>
Lizzie
liked
this
friendship
from
Lady
Glencora
amazingly
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
,
after
all
,
nothing
more
would
ever
be
known
about
the
diamonds
,
and
they
would
simply
be
remembered
as
having
added
a
peculiar
and
not
injurious
mystery
to
her
life
.
<EOS>
Lord
George
knew
,
 
but
then
she
trusted
that
a
benevolent
,
true
-
hearted
Corsair
,
such
as
was
Lord
George
,
would
never
tell
the
story
against
her
.
<EOS>
The
thieves
knew
,
 
but
surely
they
,
if
not
detected
,
would
never
tell
.
<EOS>
And
if
the
story
were
told
by
thieves
,
or
even
by
a
Corsair
,
at
any
rate
half
the
world
would
not
believe
it
.
<EOS>
What
she
had
feared
,
 
had
feared
till
the
dread
had
nearly
overcome
her
,
 
was
public
exposure
at
the
hands
of
the
police
.
<EOS>
If
she
could
escape
that
,
the
world
might
still
be
bright
before
her
.
<EOS>
And
the
interest
taken
in
her
by
such
persons
as
the
Duke
of
Omnium
and
Lady
Glencora
<EOS>
was
evidence
not
only
that
she
had
escaped
it
hitherto
,
but
also
that
she
was
in
a
fair
way
to
escape
it
altogether
.
<EOS>
Three
weeks
ago
she
would
have
given
up
half
her
income
to
have
been
able
to
steal
out
of
London
without
leaving
a
trace
behind
her
.
<EOS>
Three
weeks
ago
Mrs.
Carbuncle
was
treating
her
with
discourtesy
,
and
she
was
left
alone
nearly
the
whole
day
in
her
sick
bedroom
.
<EOS>
Things
were
going
better
with
her
now
.
<EOS>
She
was
recovering
her
position
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Camperdown
,
who
had
been
the
first
to
attack
her
,
was
,
so
to
say
,
"
nowhere
.
"
<EOS>
He
had
acknowledged
himself
beaten
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
,
whose
treatment
to
her
had
been
so
great
an
injury
,
was
coming
to
see
her
that
very
day
.
<EOS>
Her
cousin
Frank
,
though
he
had
never
offered
to
marry
her
,
was
more
affectionate
to
her
than
ever
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
had
been
at
her
feet
that
morning
borrowing
money
.
<EOS>
And
Lady
Glencora
Palliser
,
 
the
very
leading
star
of
fashion
,
 
had
called
upon
her
twice
!
<EOS>
Why
should
she
succumb
?
<EOS>
She
had
an
income
of
four
thousand
pounds
a
year
,
and
she
thought
that
she
could
remember
that
her
aunt
,
Lady
Linlithgow
,
had
but
seven
hundred
pounds
.
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
with
all
her
daughters
had
not
near
so
much
as
she
had
.
<EOS>
And
she
was
beautiful
,
too
,
and
young
,
and
perfectly
free
to
do
what
she
pleased
.
<EOS>
No
doubt
the
last
eighteen
months
of
her
life
had
been
made
wretched
by
those
horrid
diamonds
;
 
but
they
were
gone
,
and
she
had
fair
reason
to
hope
that
the
very
knowledge
of
them
was
gone
also
.
  
<EOS>
In
this
condition
would
it
be
expedient
for
her
to
accept
Lord
Fawn
when
he
came
?
<EOS>
She
could
not
,
of
course
,
be
sure
that
any
renewed
offer
would
be
the
result
of
his
visit
;
 
but
she
thought
it
probable
that
with
care
she
might
bring
him
to
that
.
<EOS>
Why
should
he
come
to
her
if
he
himself
had
no
such
intention
?
<EOS>
Her
mind
was
quite
made
up
on
this
point
,
 
that
he
should
be
made
to
renew
his
offer
;
but
whether
she
would
renew
her
acceptance
was
quite
another
question
.
<EOS>
She
had
sworn
to
her
cousin
Frank
that
she
would
never
do
so
,
and
she
had
sworn
also
that
she
would
be
revenged
on
this
wretched
lord
.
<EOS>
Now
would
be
her
opportunity
of
accomplishing
her
revenge
,
and
of
proving
to
Frank
that
she
had
been
in
earnest
.
<EOS>
And
she
positively
disliked
the
man
.
<EOS>
That
,
probably
,
did
not
go
for
much
,
but
it
went
for
something
,
even
with
Lizzie
Eustace
.
<EOS>
Her
cousin
she
did
like
,
 
and
Lord
George
.
<EOS>
She
hardly
knew
which
was
her
real
love
;
 
though
,
no
doubt
,
she
gave
the
preference
greatly
to
her
cousin
,
because
she
could
trust
him
.
<EOS>
And
then
Lord
Fawn
was
very
poor
.
<EOS>
The
other
two
men
were
poor
also
;
but
their
poverty
was
not
so
objectionable
in
Lizzie
's
eyes
as
were
the
respectable
,
close
-
fisted
economies
of
Lord
Fawn
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
,
no
doubt
,
had
an
assured
income
and
a
real
peerage
,
and
could
make
her
a
peeress
.
<EOS>
As
she
thought
of
it
all
,
she
acknowledged
that
there
was
a
great
deal
to
be
said
on
each
side
,
and
that
the
necessity
of
making
up
her
mind
then
and
<EOS>
there
was
a
heavy
burthen
upon
her
.
  
<EOS>
Exactly
at
the
hour
named
Lord
Fawn
came
,
and
Lizzie
was
,
of
course
,
found
alone
.
<EOS>
That
had
been
carefully
provided
.
<EOS>
He
was
shown
up
,
and
she
received
him
very
gracefully
.
<EOS>
She
was
sitting
,
and
she
rose
from
her
chair
,
and
put
out
her
hand
for
him
to
take
.
<EOS>
She
spoke
no
word
of
greeting
,
but
looked
at
him
with
a
pleasant
smile
,
and
stood
for
a
few
seconds
with
her
hand
in
his
.
<EOS>
He
was
awkward
,
and
much
embarrassed
,
and
she
certainly
had
no
intention
of
lessening
his
embarrassment
.
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
are
better
than
you
have
been
,
"
he
said
at
last
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
getting
better
,
Lord
Fawn
.
<EOS>
Will
you
not
sit
down
?
"
<EOS>
He
then
seated
himself
,
placing
his
hat
beside
him
on
the
floor
,
but
at
the
moment
could
not
find
words
to
speak
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
very
ill
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
so
sorry
to
hear
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
has
been
much
to
make
me
ill
,
 
has
there
not
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
About
the
robbery
,
you
mean
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
About
many
things
.
<EOS>
The
robbery
has
been
by
no
means
the
worst
,
though
,
no
doubt
,
it
frightened
me
much
.
<EOS>
There
were
two
robberies
,
Lord
Fawn
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
 
I
know
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
it
was
very
terrible
.
<EOS>
And
then
,
I
had
been
threatened
with
a
lawsuit
.
<EOS>
You
have
heard
that
,
too
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
 
I
had
heard
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
they
have
given
that
up
now
.
<EOS>
I
understand
from
my
cousin
,
Mr.
Greystock
,
who
has
been
my
truest
friend
in
all
my
troubles
,
that
the
stupid
people
have
found
out
at
last
that
they
had
not
a
leg
to
stand
on
.
<EOS>
I
daresay
you
have
heard
that
,
Lord
Fawn
?
"
  
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
certainly
had
heard
,
in
a
doubtful
way
,
the
gist
of
Mr.
Dove
's
opinion
,
namely
,
that
the
necklace
could
not
be
claimed
from
the
holder
of
it
as
an
heirloom
attached
to
the
Eustace
family
.
<EOS>
But
he
had
heard
at
the
same
time
that
Mr.
Camperdown
was
as
confident
as
ever
that
he
could
recover
the
property
by
claiming
it
after
another
fashion
.
<EOS>
Whether
or
no
that
claim
had
been
altogether
abandoned
,
or
had
been
allowed
to
fall
into
abeyance
because
of
the
absence
of
the
diamonds
,
he
did
not
know
,
nor
did
any
one
know
,
 
Mr.
Camperdown
himself
having
come
to
no
decision
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
But
Lord
Fawn
had
been
aware
that
his
sister
had
of
late
shifted
the
ground
of
her
inveterate
enmity
to
Lizzie
Eustace
,
making
use
of
the
scene
which
Mr.
Gowran
had
witnessed
,
in
lieu
of
the
lady
's
rapacity
in
regard
to
the
necklace
.
<EOS>
It
might
therefore
be
assumed
,
Lord
Fawn
thought
and
feared
,
that
his
strong
ground
in
regard
to
the
necklace
had
been
cut
from
under
his
feet
.
<EOS>
But
still
,
it
did
not
behove
him
to
confess
that
the
cause
which
he
had
always
alleged
as
the
ground
for
his
retreat
from
the
engagement
was
no
cause
at
all
.
<EOS>
It
might
go
hard
with
him
<EOS>
should
an
attempt
be
made
to
force
him
to
name
another
cause
.
<EOS>
He
knew
that
he
would
lack
the
courage
to
tell
the
lady
that
he
had
heard
from
his
sister
that
one
Andy
Gowran
had
witnessed
a
terrible
scene
down
among
the
rocks
at
Portray
.
<EOS>
So
he
sat
silent
,
and
made
no
answer
to
Lizzie
's
first
assertion
respecting
the
diamonds
.
  
<EOS>
But
the
necklace
was
her
strong
point
,
and
she
did
not
intend
that
he
should
escape
the
subject
.
<EOS>
"
If
I
remember
right
,
Lord
Fawn
,
you
yourself
saw
that
wretched
old
attorney
once
or
twice
on
the
subject
?
"
  
"
I
did
see
Mr.
Camperdown
,
certainly
.
<EOS>
He
is
my
own
family
lawyer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
were
kind
enough
to
interest
yourself
about
the
diamonds
,
 
were
you
not
?
"
<EOS>
She
asked
him
this
as
a
question
,
and
then
waited
for
a
reply
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Was
it
not
so
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Lady
Eustace
;
it
was
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
were
of
great
value
,
and
it
was
natural
,
"
continued
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
"
Of
course
you
interested
yourself
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Camperdown
was
full
of
awful
threats
against
me
;
 
was
he
not
?
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
what
he
was
not
going
to
do
.
<EOS>
He
stopped
me
in
the
street
as
I
was
driving
to
the
station
in
my
own
carriage
,
when
the
diamonds
were
with
me
;
 
which
was
a
very
strong
measure
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
And
he
wrote
me
ever
so
many
,
 
oh
,
such
horrid
letters
.
<EOS>
And
he
went
about
telling
everybody
that
it
was
an
heirloom
;
 
did
n't
he
?
<EOS>
You
know
all
that
,
Lord
Fawn
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
that
he
wanted
to
recover
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
did
he
tell
you
that
he
went
to
a
real
lawyer
,
 
<EOS>
somebody
who
really
knew
about
it
,
Mr.
Turbot
,
or
Turtle
,
or
some
such
name
as
that
,
and
the
real
lawyer
told
him
that
he
was
all
wrong
,
and
that
the
necklace
could
n't
be
an
heirloom
at
all
,
because
it
belonged
to
me
,
and
that
he
had
better
drop
his
lawsuit
altogether
?
<EOS>
Did
you
hear
that
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
 
I
did
not
hear
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
Lord
Fawn
,
you
dropped
your
inquiries
just
at
the
wrong
place
.
<EOS>
No
doubt
you
had
too
many
things
to
do
in
Parliament
and
the
Government
to
go
on
with
them
;
but
if
you
had
gone
on
,
you
would
have
learned
that
Mr.
Camperdown
had
just
to
give
it
up
,
 
because
he
had
been
wrong
from
beginning
to
end
.
<EOS>
"
Lizzie
's
words
fell
from
her
with
extreme
rapidity
,
and
she
had
become
almost
out
of
breath
from
the
effects
of
her
own
energy
.
  
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
felt
strongly
the
necessity
of
clinging
to
the
diamonds
as
his
one
great
and
sufficient
justification
.
<EOS>
"
I
thought
,
"
said
he
,
"
that
Mr.
Camperdown
had
abandoned
his
action
for
the
present
because
the
jewels
had
been
stolen
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
a
bit
of
it
,
"
said
Lizzie
,
rising
suddenly
to
her
legs
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Who
says
so
?
<EOS>
Who
dares
to
say
so
?
<EOS>
Whoever
says
so
is
 
is
a
storyteller
.
<EOS>
I
understand
all
about
that
.
<EOS>
The
action
could
go
on
just
the
same
,
and
I
could
be
made
to
pay
for
the
necklace
out
of
my
own
income
if
it
had
n't
been
my
own
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
,
Lord
Fawn
,
such
a
clever
man
as
you
,
and
one
who
has
always
been
in
the
Government
and
in
Parliament
,
can
see
that
.
<EOS>
And
will
anybody
believe
that
such
an
enemy
as
Mr.
Camperdown
has
been
to
me
,
persecuting
me
in
every
possible
way
,
telling
lies
about
me
to
everybody
,
 
who
tried
to
prevent
my
dear
,
darling
husband
from
marrying
me
,
 
that
he
would
n't
go
on
with
it
if
he
could
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Camperdown
is
a
very
respectable
man
,
Lady
Eustace
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Respectable
!
<EOS>
Talk
to
me
of
respectable
after
all
that
he
has
made
me
suffer
!
<EOS>
As
you
were
so
fond
of
making
inquiries
,
Lord
Fawn
,
you
ought
to
have
gone
on
with
them
.
<EOS>
You
never
would
believe
what
my
cousin
said
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Your
cousin
always
behaved
very
badly
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
cousin
,
who
is
a
brother
rather
than
a
cousin
,
has
known
how
to
protect
me
from
the
injuries
done
to
me
,
 
or
,
rather
,
has
known
how
to
take
my
part
when
I
have
been
injured
.
<EOS>
My
lord
,
as
you
have
been
unwilling
to
believe
him
,
why
have
you
not
gone
to
that
gentleman
who
,
as
I
say
,
is
a
real
lawyer
?
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
,
my
lord
,
that
it
need
have
concerned
you
at
all
,
but
as
you
began
,
you
surely
should
have
gone
on
with
it
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
think
so
?
<EOS>
"
She
was
still
standing
up
,
and
,
small
as
was
her
stature
,
was
almost
menacing
the
unfortunate
Under
-
Secretary
of
State
,
who
was
still
seated
in
his
chair
.
<EOS>
"
My
lord
,
"
continued
Lizzie
,
"
I
have
had
great
wrong
done
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
mean
by
me
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
by
you
.
<EOS>
Who
else
has
done
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
that
I
have
done
wrong
to
any
one
.
<EOS>
I
was
obliged
to
say
that
I
could
not
recognise
those
diamonds
as
the
property
of
my
wife
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
But
what
right
had
you
to
say
so
?
<EOS>
I
had
the
diamonds
when
you
asked
me
to
be
your
wife
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
not
know
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nor
did
you
know
that
I
had
this
little
ring
upon
my
finger
.
<EOS>
Is
it
fit
that
you
,
or
that
any
man
should
turn
round
upon
a
lady
and
say
to
her
that
your
word
is
to
be
broken
,
and
that
she
is
to
be
exposed
before
all
her
friends
,
because
you
have
taken
a
fancy
to
dislike
her
ring
or
her
brooch
?
<EOS>
I
say
,
Lord
Fawn
,
it
was
no
business
of
yours
,
even
after
you
were
engaged
to
me
.
<EOS>
What
jewels
I
might
have
,
or
not
have
,
was
no
concern
of
yours
till
after
I
had
become
your
wife
.
<EOS>
Go
and
ask
all
the
world
if
it
is
not
so
?
<EOS>
You
say
that
my
cousin
affronts
you
because
he
takes
my
part
,
 
like
a
brother
.
<EOS>
Ask
any
one
else
.
<EOS>
Ask
any
lady
you
may
know
.
<EOS>
Let
us
name
some
one
to
decide
between
us
which
of
us
has
been
wrong
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
Palliser
is
a
friend
of
yours
,
and
her
husband
is
in
the
Government
.
<EOS>
Shall
we
name
her
?
<EOS>
It
is
true
,
indeed
,
that
her
uncle
,
the
Duke
of
Omnium
,
the
grandest
and
greatest
of
English
noblemen
,
is
specially
interested
on
my
behalf
.
<EOS>
"
This
was
very
fine
in
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
The
Duke
of
Omnium
she
had
never
seen
;
but
his
name
had
been
mentioned
to
her
by
Lady
Glencora
,
and
she
was
quick
to
use
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
admit
of
no
reference
to
any
one
,
"
said
Lord
Fawn
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
I
then
,
 
what
am
I
to
do
?
<EOS>
I
am
to
be
thrown
over
simply
because
your
lordship
 
chooses
to
throw
me
over
?
<EOS>
Your
lordship
will
admit
no
reference
to
any
one
!
<EOS>
Your
lordship
makes
inquiries
as
long
as
an
attorney
tells
you
stories
against
me
,
but
drops
them
at
once
when
the
attorney
is
made
to
understand
that
he
is
wrong
.
<EOS>
Tell
me
this
,
sir
.
<EOS>
Can
you
justify
yourself
,
 
in
your
own
heart
?
"
  
<EOS>
Unfortunately
for
Lord
Fawn
,
he
was
not
sure
that
he
could
justify
himself
.
<EOS>
The
diamonds
were
gone
,
and
the
action
was
laid
aside
,
and
the
general
opinion
which
had
prevailed
a
month
or
two
since
,
that
Lizzie
had
been
disreputably
concerned
in
stealing
her
own
necklace
,
seemed
to
have
been
laid
aside
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
and
the
duke
went
for
almost
as
much
with
Lord
Fawn
as
they
did
with
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
No
doubt
the
misbehaviour
down
among
the
rocks
was
left
to
him
;
but
he
had
that
only
on
the
evidence
of
Andy
Gowran
,
 
and
even
Andy
Gowran
's
evidence
he
had
declined
to
receive
otherwise
than
second
-
hand
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
,
too
,
was
prepared
with
an
answer
to
this
charge
,
 
an
answer
which
she
had
already
made
more
than
once
,
though
the
charge
was
not
positively
brought
against
her
,
and
which
consisted
in
an
assertion
that
Frank
Greystock
was
her
brother
rather
than
her
cousin
.
<EOS>
Such
brotherhood
was
not
altogether
satisfactory
to
Lord
Fawn
,
when
he
came
once
more
to
regard
Lizzie
Eustace
as
his
possible
future
wife
;
but
still
the
assertion
was
an
answer
,
and
one
that
he
could
not
altogether
reject
.
  
<EOS>
It
certainly
was
the
case
that
he
had
again
begun
to
think
what
would
be
the
result
of
a
marriage
with
Lady
Eustace
.
<EOS>
He
must
sever
himself
altogether
from
Mrs.
Hittaway
,
and
must
relax
the
closeness
of
his
relations
with
Fawn
Court
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
a
wife
respecting
whom
he
himself
had
spread
evil
tidings
,
and
the
man
whom
he
most
hated
in
the
world
would
be
his
wife
's
favourite
cousin
,
or
,
so
to
say
,
 
brother
.
<EOS>
He
would
,
after
a
fashion
,
be
connected
with
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
Lord
George
de
Bruce
Carruthers
,
and
Sir
Griffin
Tewett
,
all
of
whom
he
regarded
as
thoroughly
disreputable
.
<EOS>
And
,
moreover
,
at
his
own
country
house
at
Portray
,
as
in
such
case
it
would
be
,
his
own
bailiff
or
steward
would
be
the
man
who
had
seen
 
what
he
had
seen
.
<EOS>
These
were
great
objections
;
but
how
was
he
to
avoid
marrying
her
?
<EOS>
He
was
engaged
to
her
.
<EOS>
How
,
at
any
rate
,
was
he
to
escape
from
the
renewal
of
his
engagement
at
this
moment
?
<EOS>
He
had
more
than
once
positively
stated
that
he
was
deterred
from
marrying
her
only
by
her
possession
of
the
diamonds
.
<EOS>
The
diamonds
were
now
gone
.
  
<EOS>
Lizzie
was
still
standing
,
waiting
for
an
answer
to
her
question
,
 
Can
you
justify
yourself
in
your
own
heart
?
<EOS>
Having
paused
for
some
seconds
,
she
repeated
her
question
in
a
stronger
and
more
personal
form
.
"
<EOS>
Had
I
been
your
sister
,
Lord
Fawn
,
and
had
another
man
behaved
to
me
as
you
have
now
done
,
would
you
say
that
he
had
behaved
well
,
and
that
she
had
no
ground
for
complaint
?
<EOS>
Can
you
bring
yourself
to
answer
that
question
honestly
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
I
shall
answer
no
question
dishonestly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Answer
it
then
.
<EOS>
No
;
you
can
not
answer
it
,
because
you
would
condemn
yourself
.
<EOS>
Now
,
Lord
Fawn
,
what
do
you
mean
to
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
had
thought
,
Lady
Eustace
,
that
any
regard
which
you
might
ever
have
entertained
for
me
 
"
  
"
Well
;
 
what
had
you
thought
of
my
regard
?
"
  
"
That
it
had
been
dissipated
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Have
I
told
you
so
?
<EOS>
Has
any
one
come
to
you
from
me
with
such
a
message
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Have
you
not
received
attentions
from
any
one
else
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Attentions
,
 
what
attentions
?
<EOS>
I
have
received
plenty
of
attentions
,
 
most
flattering
attentions
.
<EOS>
I
was
honoured
even
this
morning
by
a
most
gratifying
attention
on
the
part
of
his
grace
the
Duke
of
Omnium
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
not
mean
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
,
then
?
<EOS>
I
am
not
going
to
marry
the
Duke
of
Omnium
because
of
his
attention
,
 
nor
any
one
else
.
<EOS>
If
you
mean
,
sir
,
after
the
other
inquiries
you
have
done
me
the
honour
to
make
,
to
throw
it
in
my
face
now
,
<EOS>
that
I
have
 
have
in
any
way
rendered
myself
unworthy
of
the
position
of
your
wife
because
people
have
been
civil
and
kind
to
me
in
my
sorrow
<EOS>
,
you
are
a
greater
dastard
than
I
took
you
to
be
.
<EOS>
Tell
me
at
once
,
sir
,
whom
you
mean
.
"
  
<EOS>
It
is
hardly
too
much
to
say
that
the
man
quailed
before
her
.
<EOS>
And
it
certainly
is
not
too
much
to
say
that
,
had
Lizzie
Eustace
been
trained
as
an
actress
,
she
would
have
become
a
favourite
with
the
town
.
<EOS>
When
there
came
to
her
any
fair
scope
for
acting
,
she
was
perfect
.
<EOS>
In
the
ordinary
scenes
of
ordinary
life
,
such
as
befell
her
during
her
visit
to
Fawn
Court
,
she
could
not
acquit
herself
well
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
reality
about
her
,
and
the
want
of
it
was
strangely
plain
to
most
unobservant
eyes
.
<EOS>
But
give
her
a
part
to
play
that
required
exaggerated
,
strong
action
,
and
she
hardly
ever
failed
.
<EOS>
Even
in
that
terrible
moment
,
when
,
on
her
return
from
the
theatre
,
she
thought
that
the
police
had
discovered
her
secret
about
the
diamonds
,
though
she
nearly
sank
through
fear
,
she
still
carried
on
her
acting
in
the
presence
of
Lucinda
Roanoke
;
and
when
she
had
found
herself
constrained
to
tell
the
truth
to
Lord
George
Carruthers
,
the
power
to
personify
a
poor
,
weak
,
injured
creature
was
not
wanting
to
her
.
<EOS>
The
reader
will
not
think
that
her
position
in
society
at
the
present
moment
was
very
well
established
,
 
will
feel
,
probably
,
that
she
must
still
have
known
herself
to
be
on
the
brink
of
social
ruin
.
<EOS>
But
she
had
now
fully
worked
herself
up
to
the
necessities
of
the
occasion
,
and
was
as
able
to
play
her
part
as
well
as
any
actress
that
ever
walked
the
boards
.
<EOS>
She
had
called
him
a
dastard
,
and
now
stood
looking
him
in
the
face
.
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
mean
anybody
in
particular
,
"
said
Lord
Fawn
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
what
right
can
you
have
to
ask
me
whether
I
have
received
attentions
?
<EOS>
Had
it
not
been
for
the
affectionate
attention
of
my
cousin
,
Mr.
Greystock
,
I
should
have
died
beneath
the
load
of
sorrow
you
have
heaped
upon
me
!
"
<EOS>
This
she
said
quite
boldly
,
and
yet
the
man
she
named
was
he
of
whom
Andy
Gowran
told
his
horrid
story
,
and
<EOS>
whose
love
-
making
to
Lizzie
had
,
in
Mrs.
Hittaway
's
opinion
,
been
sufficient
to
atone
for
any
falling
off
of
strength
in
the
matter
of
the
diamonds
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
rumour
reached
me
,
"
said
Lord
Fawn
,
plucking
up
his
courage
,
"
that
you
were
engaged
to
marry
your
cousin
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
rumour
lied
,
my
lord
.
<EOS>
And
he
or
she
who
repeated
the
rumour
to
you
,
lied
also
.
<EOS>
And
any
he
or
she
who
repeats
it
again
will
go
on
with
the
lie
.
"
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
's
brow
became
very
black
.
<EOS>
The
word
"
lie
"
itself
was
offensive
to
him
,
 
offensive
,
even
though
it
might
not
be
applied
directly
to
himself
;
but
he
still
quailed
,
and
was
unable
to
express
his
indignation
,
 
as
he
had
done
to
poor
Lucy
Morris
,
his
mother
's
governess
.
"
<EOS>
And
now
let
me
ask
,
Lord
Fawn
,
on
what
ground
you
<EOS>
and
I
stand
together
.
<EOS>
When
my
friend
,
Lady
Glencora
,
asked
me
,
only
this
morning
,
whether
my
engagement
with
you
was
still
an
existing
fact
,
and
brought
me
the
kindest
possible
message
on
the
same
subject
from
her
uncle
,
the
duke
,
I
hardly
knew
what
answer
to
make
her
.
"
<EOS>
It
was
not
surprising
that
Lizzie
in
her
difficulties
should
use
her
new
friend
,
but
perhaps
she
over
-
did
the
friendship
a
little
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I
told
her
that
we
were
engaged
,
but
that
your
lordship
's
conduct
to
me
had
been
so
strange
,
that
I
hardly
knew
how
to
speak
of
you
among
my
friends
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
thought
I
explained
myself
to
your
cousin
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
cousin
certainly
did
not
understand
your
explanation
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
was
certain
that
Greystock
had
understood
it
well
;
and
Greystock
had
in
return
insulted
him
,
 
because
the
engagement
was
broken
off
.
<EOS>
But
it
is
impossible
to
argue
on
facts
with
a
woman
who
has
been
ill
-
used
.
<EOS>
"
After
all
that
has
passed
,
perhaps
we
had
better
part
,
"
said
Lord
Fawn
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
I
shall
put
the
matter
into
the
hands
of
the
Duke
of
Omnium
,
"
said
Lizzie
boldly
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
have
my
whole
life
ruined
,
my
good
name
blasted
 
"
  
"
I
have
not
said
a
word
to
injure
your
good
name
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
On
what
plea
,
then
,
have
you
dared
to
take
upon
yourself
to
put
an
end
to
an
engagement
which
was
made
at
your
own
pressing
request
,
 
which
was
,
of
course
,
made
at
your
own
request
?
<EOS>
On
what
ground
do
you
justify
such
conduct
?
<EOS>
You
are
a
Liberal
,
Lord
Fawn
;
and
everybody
regards
the
Duke
of
Omnium
as
the
head
of
the
Liberal
nobility
in
England
.
<EOS>
He
is
my
friend
,
and
I
shall
put
the
matter
into
his
hands
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
,
probably
,
from
her
cousin
Frank
that
Lizzie
had
learned
that
Lord
Fawn
was
more
afraid
of
the
leaders
of
his
own
party
than
of
any
other
tribunal
upon
earth
,
 
or
perhaps
elsewhere
.
  
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
felt
the
absurdity
of
the
threat
,
and
yet
it
had
effect
upon
him
.
<EOS>
He
knew
that
the
Duke
of
Omnium
was
a
worn
-
out
old
debauchee
,
with
one
foot
in
the
grave
,
who
was
looked
after
by
two
or
three
women
who
were
only
anxious
that
he
should
not
disgrace
himself
by
some
absurdity
before
he
died
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
the
Duke
of
Omnium
,
or
the
duke
's
name
,
was
a
power
in
the
nation
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
was
certainly
very
powerful
,
and
Lady
Glencora
's
husband
was
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
suppose
that
the
duke
cared
in
the
least
whether
Lizzie
Eustace
was
or
was
not
married
;
 
but
Lady
Glencora
had
certainly
interested
herself
about
Lizzie
,
and
might
make
London
almost
too
hot
to
hold
him
if
she
chose
to
go
about
everywhere
saying
that
he
ought
to
marry
the
lady
.
<EOS>
And
in
addition
to
all
this
prospective
grief
,
there
was
the
trouble
of
the
present
moment
.
<EOS>
He
was
in
Lizzie
's
own
room
,
 
fool
that
he
had
been
to
come
there
,
 
and
he
must
get
out
as
best
he
could
.
"
<EOS>
Lady
Eustace
,
"
he
said
,
"
I
am
most
anxious
not
to
behave
badly
in
this
matter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
are
behaving
badly
,
 
very
badly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
With
your
leave
I
will
tell
you
what
I
would
suggest
.
<EOS>
I
will
submit
to
you
in
writing
my
opinion
on
this
matter
;
"
 
Lord
Fawn
had
been
all
his
life
submitting
his
opinion
in
writing
,
and
thought
that
he
was
rather
a
good
hand
at
the
work
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
then
endeavour
to
explain
to
you
the
reasons
which
make
me
think
that
it
will
be
better
for
us
both
that
our
engagement
should
be
at
an
end
.
<EOS>
If
,
after
reading
it
,
you
shall
disagree
with
me
,
and
still
insist
on
the
right
which
I
gave
you
when
I
asked
you
to
become
my
wife
,
 
I
will
then
perform
the
promise
which
I
certainly
made
.
"
<EOS>
To
this
most
foolish
proposal
on
his
part
,
Lizzie
,
of
course
,
acquiesced
.
<EOS>
She
acquiesced
,
and
bade
him
farewell
with
her
sweetest
smile
.
<EOS>
It
was
now
manifest
to
her
that
she
could
have
her
husband
,
 
or
her
revenge
,
just
as
she
might
prefer
.
  
<EOS>
This
had
been
a
day
of
triumph
to
her
,
and
she
was
talking
of
it
in
the
evening
triumphantly
to
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
when
she
was
told
that
a
policeman
wanted
to
see
her
down
-
stairs
!
<EOS>
Oh
,
those
wretched
police
!
<EOS>
Again
all
the
blood
rushed
to
her
head
and
nearly
killed
her
.
<EOS>
She
descended
slowly
;
and
was
then
informed
by
a
man
,
not
dressed
,
like
Bunfit
,
in
plain
clothes
,
but
with
all
the
paraphernalia
of
a
policeman
's
uniform
,
that
her
late
servant
,
Patience
Crabstick
,
had
given
herself
up
as
Queen
's
evidence
,
and
was
now
in
custody
in
Scotland
Yard
.
<EOS>
It
had
been
thought
right
that
she
should
be
so
far
informed
;
but
the
man
was
able
to
tell
her
nothing
further
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
Know
Where
My
Heart
Is
"
 
On
the
Sunday
following
,
Frank
,
as
usual
,
was
in
Hertford
Street
.
<EOS>
He
had
become
almost
a
favourite
with
Mrs.
Carbuncle
;
and
had
so
far
ingratiated
himself
even
with
Lucinda
Roanoke
<EOS>
that
,
according
to
Lizzie
's
report
,
<EOS>
he
might
,
if
so
inclined
,
rob
Sir
Griffin
of
his
prize
without
much
difficulty
.
<EOS>
On
this
occasion
he
was
unhappy
and
in
low
spirits
;
and
when
questioned
on
the
subject
made
no
secret
of
the
fact
that
he
was
harassed
for
money
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
truth
is
I
have
overdrawn
my
bankers
by
five
hundred
pounds
,
and
they
have
,
as
they
say
,
ventured
to
remind
me
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
wish
they
were
not
venturesome
quite
so
often
;
for
they
reminded
me
of
the
same
fact
about
a
fortnight
ago
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
do
with
your
money
,
Mr.
Greystock
?
"
asked
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
laughing
.
  
<EOS>
"
Muddle
it
away
,
paying
my
bills
with
it
,
 
according
to
the
very
,
very
old
story
.
<EOS>
The
fact
is
,
I
live
in
that
detestable
no
-
man
's
land
,
between
respectability
and
insolvency
,
which
has
none
of
the
pleasure
of
either
.
<EOS>
I
am
fair
game
for
every
creditor
,
as
I
am
supposed
to
pay
my
way
,
 
and
yet
I
never
can
pay
my
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Just
like
my
poor
dear
father
,
"
said
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
exactly
,
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
He
managed
much
better
,
and
never
paid
anybody
.
<EOS>
If
I
could
only
land
on
terra
-
firma
,
 
one
side
or
the
other
,
 
<EOS>
I
should
n't
much
care
which
.
<EOS>
As
it
is
I
have
all
the
recklessness
,
but
none
of
the
carelessness
,
of
the
hopelessly
insolvent
man
.
<EOS>
And
it
is
so
hard
with
us
.
<EOS>
Attorneys
owe
us
large
sums
of
money
,
and
we
ca
n't
dun
them
very
well
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
lot
of
money
due
to
me
from
rich
men
,
who
do
n't
pay
me
simply
because
they
do
n't
think
that
it
matters
.
<EOS>
I
talk
to
them
grandly
,
and
look
big
,
as
though
money
was
the
last
thing
I
thought
of
,
when
I
am
longing
to
touch
my
hat
and
ask
them
as
a
great
favour
to
settle
my
little
bill
.
<EOS>
"
All
this
time
Lizzie
was
full
of
matter
which
she
must
impart
to
her
cousin
,
and
could
impart
to
him
only
in
privacy
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
absolutely
necessary
that
she
should
tell
him
what
she
had
heard
of
Patience
Crabstick
.
<EOS>
In
her
heart
of
hearts
she
wished
that
Patience
Crabstick
had
gone
off
safely
with
her
plunder
to
the
Antipodes
.
<EOS>
She
had
no
wish
to
get
back
what
had
been
lost
,
either
in
the
matter
of
the
diamonds
or
of
the
smaller
things
taken
.
<EOS>
She
had
sincerely
wished
that
the
police
might
fail
in
all
their
endeavours
,
and
that
the
thieves
might
enjoy
perfect
security
with
their
booty
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
even
begrudge
Mr.
Benjamin
the
diamonds
,
 
or
Lord
George
,
if
in
truth
Lord
George
had
been
the
last
thief
.
<EOS>
The
robbery
had
enabled
her
to
get
the
better
of
Mr.
Camperdown
,
and
apparently
of
Lord
Fawn
;
and
had
freed
her
from
the
custody
of
property
which
she
had
learned
to
hate
.
<EOS>
It
had
been
a
very
good
robbery
.
<EOS>
But
now
these
wretched
police
had
found
Patience
Crabstick
,
and
would
disturb
her
again
!
  
<EOS>
Of
course
she
must
tell
her
cousin
.
<EOS>
He
must
hear
the
news
,
and
it
would
be
better
that
he
should
hear
it
from
her
than
from
others
.
<EOS>
This
was
Sunday
,
and
she
thought
he
would
be
sure
to
know
the
truth
on
the
following
Monday
.
<EOS>
In
this
she
was
right
;
for
on
the
Monday
old
Lady
Linlithgow
saw
it
stated
in
the
newspapers
that
an
arrest
had
been
made
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
something
to
tell
you
,
"
she
said
,
as
soon
as
she
had
succeeded
in
finding
herself
alone
with
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Anything
about
the
diamonds
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
no
;
not
exactly
about
the
diamonds
;
 
though
perhaps
it
is
.
<EOS>
But
first
,
Frank
,
I
want
to
say
something
else
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
about
the
diamonds
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
no
;
 
not
at
all
.
<EOS>
It
is
this
.
<EOS>
You
must
let
me
lend
you
that
five
hundred
pounds
you
want
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
you
shall
do
no
such
thing
.
<EOS>
I
should
not
have
mentioned
it
to
you
if
I
had
not
thought
that
you
were
one
of
the
insolvent
yourself
.
<EOS>
You
were
in
debt
yourself
when
we
last
talked
about
money
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
So
I
am
;
 
and
that
horrid
woman
,
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
has
made
me
lend
her
one
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
.
<EOS>
But
it
is
so
different
with
you
,
Frank
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
 
my
needs
are
greater
than
hers
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
she
to
me
?
 
<EOS>
while
you
are
everything
!
<EOS>
Things
ca
n't
be
so
bad
with
me
<EOS>
but
what
I
can
raise
five
hundred
pounds
.
<EOS>
After
all
,
I
am
not
really
in
debt
,
for
a
person
with
my
income
;
but
if
I
were
,
still
my
first
duty
would
be
to
help
you
if
you
want
help
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Be
generous
first
,
and
just
afterwards
.
<EOS>
That
's
it
;
 
is
n't
it
,
Lizzie
?
<EOS>
But
indeed
,
under
no
circumstances
could
I
take
a
penny
of
your
money
.
<EOS>
There
are
some
persons
from
whom
a
man
can
borrow
,
and
some
from
whom
he
can
not
.
<EOS>
You
are
clearly
one
of
those
from
whom
I
can
not
borrow
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
not
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
 
one
ca
n't
explain
these
things
.
<EOS>
It
simply
is
so
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
was
quite
the
natural
person
to
borrow
your
money
,
and
it
seems
that
she
has
complied
with
nature
.
<EOS>
Some
Jew
who
wants
thirty
per
cent
.
<EOS>
is
the
natural
person
for
me
.
<EOS>
All
these
things
are
arranged
,
and
it
is
of
no
use
disturbing
the
arrangements
and
getting
out
of
course
.
<EOS>
I
shall
pull
through
.
<EOS>
And
now
let
me
know
your
own
news
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
police
have
taken
Patience
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
have
,
 
have
they
?
<EOS>
Then
at
last
we
shall
know
all
about
the
diamonds
.
<EOS>
"
This
was
gall
to
poor
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
"
Where
did
they
get
her
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
who
told
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
policeman
came
here
last
night
and
said
so
.
<EOS>
She
is
going
to
turn
against
the
thieves
,
and
tell
all
that
she
knows
.
<EOS>
Nasty
,
mean
creature
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thieves
are
nasty
,
mean
creatures
generally
.
<EOS>
We
shall
get
it
all
out
now
,
 
as
to
what
happened
at
Carlisle
and
what
happened
here
.
<EOS>
Do
you
know
that
everybody
believes
,
up
to
this
moment
,
that
your
dear
friend
Lord
George
de
Bruce
sold
the
diamonds
to
Mr.
Benjamin
,
the
jeweller
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Lizzie
could
only
shrug
her
shoulders
.
<EOS>
She
herself
,
among
many
doubts
,
was
upon
the
whole
disposed
to
think
as
everybody
thought
.
<EOS>
She
did
believe
,
 
as
far
as
she
believed
anything
in
the
matter
,
that
the
Corsair
had
determined
to
become
possessed
of
the
prize
from
the
moment
that
he
saw
it
in
Scotland
,
that
the
Corsair
arranged
the
robbery
in
Carlisle
,
and
that
again
he
arranged
the
robbery
in
the
London
house
as
soon
as
he
learned
from
Lizzie
where
the
diamonds
were
placed
.
<EOS>
To
her
mind
this
had
been
the
most
ready
solution
of
the
mystery
,
and
when
she
found
that
other
people
almost
regarded
him
as
the
thief
,
her
doubts
became
a
belief
.
<EOS>
And
she
did
not
in
the
least
despise
or
dislike
him
or
condemn
him
for
what
he
had
done
.
<EOS>
Were
he
to
come
to
her
and
confess
it
all
,
telling
his
story
in
such
a
manner
as
to
make
her
seem
to
be
safe
for
the
future
,
she
would
congratulate
him
and
accept
him
at
once
as
her
own
dear
,
expected
Corsair
.
<EOS>
But
,
if
so
,
he
should
not
have
bungled
the
thing
.
<EOS>
He
should
have
managed
his
subordinates
better
than
to
have
one
of
them
turn
evidence
against
him
.
<EOS>
He
should
have
been
able
to
get
rid
of
a
poor
weak
female
like
Patience
Crabstick
.
<EOS>
Why
had
he
not
sent
her
to
New
York
,
or
 
or
 
or
anywhere
?
<EOS>
If
Lizzie
were
to
hear
that
Lord
George
had
taken
Patience
out
to
sea
in
a
yacht
,
 
somewhere
among
the
bright
islands
of
which
she
thought
so
much
,
 
and
dropped
the
girl
overboard
,
tied
up
in
a
bag
,
she
would
regard
it
as
a
proper
Corsair
arrangement
.
<EOS>
Now
she
was
angry
with
Lord
George
because
her
trouble
was
coming
back
upon
her
.
<EOS>
Frank
had
suggested
that
Lord
George
was
the
robber
in
chief
,
and
Lizzie
merely
shrugged
her
shoulders
.
<EOS>
"
We
shall
know
all
about
it
now
,
"
said
he
triumphantly
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
that
I
want
to
know
any
more
about
it
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
so
tortured
about
these
wretched
diamonds
,
that
I
never
wish
to
hear
them
mentioned
again
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
care
who
has
got
them
.
<EOS>
My
enemies
used
to
think
that
I
loved
them
so
well
that
I
could
not
bear
to
part
with
them
.
<EOS>
I
hated
them
always
,
and
never
took
any
pleasure
in
them
.
<EOS>
I
used
to
think
that
I
would
throw
them
into
the
sea
;
and
when
they
were
gone
I
was
glad
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thieves
ought
to
be
discovered
,
Lizzie
,
 
for
the
good
of
the
community
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
care
for
the
community
.
<EOS>
What
has
the
community
ever
done
for
me
?
<EOS>
And
now
I
have
something
else
to
tell
you
.
<EOS>
Ever
so
many
people
came
yesterday
as
well
as
that
wretched
policeman
.
<EOS>
Dear
Lady
Glencora
was
here
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
'll
make
a
Radical
of
you
among
them
,
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
care
a
bit
about
that
.
<EOS>
I
'd
just
as
soon
be
a
Radical
as
a
stupid
old
Conservative
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
has
been
most
kind
,
and
she
brought
me
the
dearest
message
from
the
Duke
of
Omnium
.
<EOS>
The
duke
had
heard
how
ill
I
had
been
treated
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
duke
is
doting
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
so
easy
to
say
that
when
a
man
is
old
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
think
you
know
him
,
Frank
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
in
the
least
;
 
nor
do
I
wish
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
something
to
have
the
sympathy
of
men
high
placed
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
And
as
to
Lady
Glencora
,
I
do
love
her
dearly
.
<EOS>
She
just
comes
up
to
my
beau
-
ideal
of
what
a
woman
should
be
,
 
disinterested
,
full
of
spirit
,
affectionate
,
with
a
dash
of
romance
about
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
great
dash
of
romance
,
I
fancy
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
a
determination
to
be
something
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
Palliser
is
something
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
is
awfully
rich
,
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
so
.
<EOS>
At
any
rate
,
that
is
no
disgrace
.
<EOS>
And
then
,
Frank
,
somebody
else
came
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Lord
Fawn
was
to
have
come
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
He
did
come
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
how
did
it
go
between
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
 
that
will
be
so
difficult
to
explain
.
<EOS>
I
wish
you
had
been
behind
the
curtain
to
hear
it
all
.
<EOS>
It
is
so
necessary
that
you
should
know
,
and
yet
it
is
so
hard
to
tell
.
<EOS>
I
spoke
up
to
him
,
and
was
quite
high
-
spirited
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
daresay
you
were
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
told
him
out
,
bravely
,
of
all
the
wrong
he
had
done
me
.
<EOS>
I
did
not
sit
and
whimper
,
I
can
assure
you
.
<EOS>
Then
he
talked
about
you
,
 
of
your
attentions
.
"
  
<EOS>
Frank
Greystock
,
of
course
,
remembered
the
scene
among
the
rocks
,
and
Mr.
Gowran
's
wagging
head
and
watchful
eyes
.
<EOS>
At
the
time
he
had
felt
certain
that
some
use
would
be
made
of
Andy
's
vigilance
,
though
he
had
not
traced
the
connexion
between
the
man
and
Mrs.
Hittaway
.
<EOS>
If
Lord
Fawn
had
heard
of
the
little
scene
,
there
might
,
doubtless
,
be
cause
for
him
to
talk
of
"
attentions
.
"
<EOS>
"
What
did
it
matter
to
him
?
"
asked
Frank
.
<EOS>
"
He
is
an
insolent
ass
,
 
as
I
have
told
him
once
,
and
shall
have
to
tell
him
again
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
did
matter
,
Frank
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
see
it
a
bit
.
<EOS>
He
had
resigned
his
rights
,
 
whatever
they
were
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
had
not
accepted
his
resignation
,
 
as
they
say
in
the
newspapers
;
 
nor
have
I
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
would
still
marry
him
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
say
that
,
Frank
.
<EOS>
This
is
an
important
business
,
and
let
us
go
through
it
steadily
.
<EOS>
I
would
certainly
like
to
have
him
again
at
my
feet
.
<EOS>
Whether
I
would
deign
to
lift
him
up
again
is
another
thing
.
<EOS>
Is
not
that
natural
,
after
what
he
has
done
to
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Woman
's
nature
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
am
a
woman
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
Frank
.
<EOS>
I
would
have
him
again
at
my
disposal
,
 
and
he
is
so
.
<EOS>
He
is
to
write
me
a
long
letter
;
 
so
like
a
Government
-
man
,
is
n't
it
?
<EOS>
And
he
has
told
me
already
what
he
is
to
put
into
the
letter
.
<EOS>
They
always
do
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
He
is
to
say
that
he
'll
marry
me
if
I
choose
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
has
promised
to
say
that
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
When
he
said
that
he
would
come
,
I
made
up
my
mind
that
he
should
not
go
out
of
the
house
till
he
had
promised
that
.
<EOS>
He
could
n't
get
out
of
it
.
<EOS>
What
had
I
done
?
"
<EOS>
Frank
thought
of
the
scene
among
the
rocks
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
,
of
course
,
allude
to
it
,
but
Lizzie
was
not
so
reticent
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
to
what
that
old
rogue
saw
down
in
Scotland
,
I
do
n't
care
a
bit
about
it
,
Frank
.
<EOS>
He
has
been
up
in
London
,
and
telling
them
all
,
no
doubt
.
<EOS>
Nasty
,
dirty
eavesdropper
!
<EOS>
But
what
does
it
come
to
?
<EOS>
Psha
!
<EOS>
When
he
mentioned
your
name
I
silenced
him
at
once
.
<EOS>
What
could
I
have
done
,
unless
I
had
had
some
friend
?
<EOS>
At
any
rate
,
he
is
to
ask
me
again
in
writing
,
 
and
then
what
shall
I
say
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
consult
your
own
heart
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
Frank
;
 
I
need
not
do
that
.
<EOS>
Why
do
you
say
so
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
not
what
else
to
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
A
woman
can
marry
without
consulting
her
heart
.
<EOS>
Women
do
so
every
day
.
<EOS>
This
man
is
a
lord
,
and
has
a
position
.
<EOS>
No
doubt
I
despise
him
thoroughly
,
 
utterly
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
hate
him
,
because
he
is
not
worth
being
hated

<EOS>

<EOS>
"
And
yet
you
would
marry
him
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
said
so
.
<EOS>
I
will
tell
you
this
truth
,
though
perhaps
you
will
say
it
is
not
feminine
.
<EOS>
I
would
fain
marry
some
one
.
<EOS>
To
be
as
I
have
been
for
the
last
two
years
is
not
a
happy
condition
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
not
marry
a
man
I
despised
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nor
would
I
,
 
willingly
.
<EOS>
He
is
honest
and
respectable
;
and
in
spite
of
all
that
has
come
and
gone
would
,
I
think
,
behave
well
to
a
woman
when
she
was
once
his
wife
.
<EOS>
Of
course
,
I
would
prefer
to
marry
a
man
that
I
could
love
.
<EOS>
But
if
that
is
impossible
,
Frank
 
"
  
"
I
thought
that
you
had
determined
that
you
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
this
lord
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
thought
so
too
.
<EOS>
Frank
,
you
have
known
all
that
I
have
thought
,
and
all
that
I
have
wished
.
<EOS>
You
talk
to
me
of
marrying
where
my
heart
has
been
given
.
<EOS>
Is
it
possible
that
I
should
do
so
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
am
I
to
say
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Come
,
Frank
,
be
true
with
me
.
<EOS>
I
am
forcing
myself
to
speak
truth
to
you
.
<EOS>
I
think
that
between
you
and
me
,
at
any
rate
,
there
should
be
no
words
spoken
that
are
not
true
.
<EOS>
Frank
,
you
know
where
my
heart
is
.
<EOS>
"
As
she
said
this
,
she
stood
over
him
,
and
laid
her
hand
upon
his
shoulder
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Will
you
answer
me
one
question
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
can
,
I
will

<EOS>
"
  
"
Are
you
engaged
to
marry
Lucy
Morris

"
  
"
I
am

"
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
intend
to
marry
her
?
"
<EOS>
To
this
question
he
made
no
immediate
answer
.
<EOS>
"
We
are
old
enough
now
,
Frank
,
to
know
that
something
more
than
what
you
call
heart
is
wanted
to
make
us
happy
when
we
marry

I
will
say
nothing
hard

she
be
my
rival

<EOS>
"
You
can
say
nothing
hard
of
her
.
<EOS>
She
is
perfect

We
will
let
that
pass
,

it
is
hardly
kind
of
you

just
at
the
present
moment

<EOS>
Let
her
be
perfect

<EOS>
Can
you
marry
this
perfection
without
a
sixpence
,
 
you
that
are
in
debt
,
and
who
never
could
save
a
sixpence
in
your
life

<EOS>
Would
it
be
for
her
good
,
 
or
for
yours
?
<EOS>
You
have
done
a
foolish
thing

sir

you
know
that
you
must
get
out
of
it

nothing

kind

is
the
truth

<EOS>
My
present
need
makes
me
bold
.
<EOS>
Frank
,
shall
I
be
your
wife
?
<EOS>
Such
a
marriage
will
not
be
without
love
,
at
any
rate
on
one
side
,
 
though
there
be
utter
indifference
on
the
other
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
I
am
not
indifferent
to
you
,
"
said
he
,
with
wicked
weakness
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
at
any
rate
,
"
she
continued
,
"
you
must
understand
what
must
be
my
answer
to
Lord
Fawn

<EOS>
It
is
you
that
must
answer
Lord
Fawn
.
<EOS>
If
my
heart
is
to
be
broken
,
I
may
as
well
break
it
under
his
roof
as
another
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
roof
to
offer
you
,
"
he
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
have
one
for
you
,
"
she
said
,
throwing
her
arm
round
his
neck
.
<EOS>
He
bore
her
embrace
for
a
minute
,
returning
it
with
the
pressure
of
his
arm
;
and
then
,
escaping
from
it
,
seized
his
hat
and
left
her
standing
in
the
room

The
Corsair
Is
Afraid
 
<EOS>
On
the
following
morning
,
 
Monday
morning
,
 
there
appeared
in
one
of
the
daily
newspapers
the
paragraph
of
which
Lady
Linlithgow
had
spoken
to
Lucy
Morris
.
<EOS>
"
We
are
given
to
understand
,
"
 
newspapers
are
very
frequently
given
to
understand
,
 
"
that
a
man
well
-
known
to
the
London
police
as
an
accomplished
housebreaker
has
been
arrested
in
reference
to
the
robbery
which
was
effected
on
the
30th
of
January
last
at
Lady
Eustace
's
house
in
Hertford
Street
.
<EOS>
No
doubt
the
same
person
was
concerned
in
the
robbery
of
her
ladyship
's
jewels
at
Carlisle
on
the
night
of
the
8th
of
January
.
<EOS>
The
mystery
which
has
so
long
enveloped
these
two
affairs
,
and
which
has
been
so
discreditable
to
the
metropolitan
police
,
will
now
probably
be
cleared
up
.
<EOS>
"
There
was
not
a
word
about
Patience
Crabstick
in
this
;
and
,
as
Lizzie
observed
,
the
news
brought
by
the
policeman
on
Saturday
night
referred
only
to
Patience
,
and
said
nothing
of
the
arrest
of
any
burglar
.
<EOS>
The
ladies
in
Hertford
Street
scanned
the
sentence
with
the
greatest
care
,
and
Mrs.
Carbuncle
was
very
angry
because
the
house
was
said
to
be
Lizzie
's
house
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
n't
my
doing
,
"
said
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
policeman
came
to
you
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
say
a
word
to
the
man
,
 
<EOS>
and
I
did
n't
want
him
to
come
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
it
will
be
all
found
out
now
,
"
said
Lucinda
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
it
were
all
clean
forgotten
,
"
said
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
ought
to
be
found
out
,
"
said
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
<EOS>
"
But
the
police
should
be
more
careful
in
what
they
say
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
we
shall
all
have
to
go
before
the
magistrates
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Poor
Lizzie
felt
that
fresh
trouble
was
certainly
coming
upon
her
.
<EOS>
She
had
learned
now
that
the
crime
for
which
she
might
be
prosecuted
and
punished
was
that
of
perjury
,
 
that
even
if
everything
was
known
,
she
could
not
be
accused
of
stealing
,
and
that
if
she
could
only
get
out
of
the
way
till
the
wrath
of
the
magistrate
and
policemen
should
have
evaporated
,
she
might
possibly
escape
altogether
.
<EOS>
At
any
rate
,
they
could
not
take
her
income
away
from
her
.
<EOS>
But
how
could
she
get
out
of
the
way
,
and
how
could
she
endure
to
be
cross
-
examined
,
and
looked
at
,
and
inquired
into
,
by
all
those
who
would
be
concerned
in
the
matter
?
<EOS>
She
thought
that
,
if
only
she
could
have
arranged
her
matrimonial
affairs
before
the
bad
day
came
upon
her
,
she
could
have
endured
it
better
.
<EOS>
If
she
might
be
allowed
to
see
Lord
George
,
she
could
ask
for
advice
,
 
could
ask
for
advice
,
not
as
she
was
always
forced
to
do
from
her
cousin
,
on
a
false
statement
of
facts
,
but
with
everything
known
and
declared
.
  
<EOS>
On
that
very
day
Lord
George
came
to
Hertford
Street
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
there
more
than
once
,
perhaps
half
a
dozen
times
,
since
the
robbery
;
but
on
all
these
occasions
Lizzie
had
been
in
bed
,
and
he
had
declined
to
visit
her
in
her
chamber
.
<EOS>
In
fact
,
even
Lord
George
had
become
somewhat
afraid
of
her
since
he
had
been
told
the
true
story
as
to
the
necklace
at
Carlisle
.
<EOS>
That
story
he
had
heard
from
herself
,
and
he
had
also
heard
from
Mr.
Benjamin
some
other
little
details
as
to
her
former
life
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Benjamin
,
whose
very
close
attention
had
been
drawn
to
the
Eustace
diamonds
,
had
told
Lord
George
how
he
had
valued
them
at
her
ladyship
's
request
,
and
had
caused
an
iron
case
to
be
made
for
them
,
and
how
her
ladyship
had
,
on
one
occasion
,
endeavoured
to
sell
the
necklace
to
him
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Benjamin
,
who
certainly
was
intimate
with
Lord
George
,
was
very
fond
of
talking
about
the
diamonds
,
and
had
once
suggested
to
his
lordship
that
,
were
they
to
become
his
lordship
's
by
marriage
,
he
,
Benjamin
,
might
be
willing
to
treat
with
his
lordship
.
<EOS>
In
regard
to
treating
with
her
ladyship
,
 
Mr.
Benjamin
acknowledged
that
he
thought
it
would
be
too
hazardous
.
<EOS>
Then
came
the
robbery
of
the
box
,
and
Lord
George
was
all
astray
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Benjamin
was
for
a
while
equally
astray
,
but
neither
friend
believed
in
the
other
friend
's
innocence
.
<EOS>
That
Lord
George
should
suspect
Mr.
Benjamin
was
quite
natural
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Benjamin
hardly
knew
what
to
think
;
 
hardly
gave
Lord
George
credit
for
the
necessary
courage
,
skill
,
and
energy
.
<EOS>
But
at
last
,
as
he
began
to
put
two
and
two
together
,
he
divined
the
truth
,
and
was
enabled
to
set
the
docile
Patience
on
the
watch
over
her
mistress
's
belongings
.
<EOS>
So
it
had
been
with
Mr.
Benjamin
,
who
at
last
was
able
to
satisfy
Mr.
Smiler
and
Mr.
Cann
that
he
had
been
no
party
to
their
cruel
disappointment
at
Carlisle
.
<EOS>
How
Lord
George
had
learned
the
truth
has
been
told
;
 
the
truth
as
to
Lizzie
's
hiding
the
necklace
under
her
pillow
and
bringing
it
up
to
London
in
her
desk
.
<EOS>
But
of
the
facts
of
the
second
robbery
he
knew
nothing
up
to
this
morning
.
<EOS>
He
almost
suspected
that
Lizzie
had
herself
again
been
at
work
,
 
and
he
was
afraid
of
her
.
<EOS>
He
had
promised
her
that
he
would
take
care
of
her
,
 
had
,
perhaps
,
said
enough
to
make
her
believe
that
some
day
he
would
marry
her
.
<EOS>
He
hardly
remembered
what
he
had
said
;
 
but
he
was
afraid
of
her
.
<EOS>
She
was
so
wonderfully
clever
that
,
if
he
did
not
take
care
,
she
would
get
him
into
some
mess
from
which
he
would
be
unable
to
extricate
himself
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
never
whispered
her
secret
to
any
one
;
and
had
still
been
at
a
loss
about
the
second
robbery
,
when
he
too
saw
the
paragraph
in
the
newspaper
.
<EOS>
He
went
direct
to
Scotland
Yard
and
made
inquiry
there
.
<EOS>
His
name
had
been
so
often
used
in
the
affair
,
that
such
inquiry
from
him
was
justified
.
"
<EOS>
Well
,
my
lord
;
yes
;
we
have
found
out
something
,
"
said
Bunfit
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Benjamin
is
off
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Benjamin
off
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Cut
the
painter
,
my
lord
,
and
started
.
<EOS>
But
what
's
the
good
,
now
we
has
the
wires
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
who
were
the
thieves
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
my
lord
,
that
's
telling
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
I
do
n't
know
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
I
do
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
two
or
three
of
us
knows
.
<EOS>
You
'll
hear
all
in
good
time
,
my
lord
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Bunfit
wished
to
appear
communicative
because
he
knew
but
little
himself
.
<EOS>
Gager
,
in
the
meanest
possible
manner
,
had
kept
the
matter
very
close
;
but
the
fact
that
Mr.
Benjamin
had
started
suddenly
on
foreign
travel
had
become
known
to
Mr.
Bunfit
.
  
<EOS>
Lord
George
had
been
very
careful
,
asking
no
question
about
the
necklace
;
 
no
question
which
would
have
shown
that
he
knew
that
the
necklace
had
been
in
Hertford
Street
when
the
robbery
took
place
there
;
but
it
seemed
to
him
now
that
the
police
must
be
aware
that
it
was
so
.
<EOS>
The
arrest
had
been
made
because
of
the
robbery
in
Hertford
Street
,
and
because
of
that
arrest
Mr.
Benjamin
had
taken
his
departure
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Benjamin
was
too
big
a
man
to
have
concerned
himself
deeply
in
the
smaller
matters
which
had
then
been
stolen
.
  
<EOS>
From
Scotland
Yard
Lord
George
went
direct
to
Hertford
Street
.
<EOS>
He
was
in
want
of
money
,
in
want
of
a
settled
home
,
in
want
of
a
future
income
,
and
altogether
unsatisfied
with
his
present
mode
of
life
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
Eustace
,
no
doubt
,
would
take
him
,
 
unless
she
had
told
her
secret
to
some
other
lover
.
<EOS>
To
have
his
wife
,
immediately
on
her
marriage
,
or
even
before
it
,
arraigned
for
perjury
,
would
not
be
pleasant
.
<EOS>
There
was
very
much
in
the
whole
affair
of
which
he
would
not
be
proud
as
he
led
his
bride
to
the
altar
;
 
but
a
man
does
not
expect
to
get
four
thousand
pounds
a
year
for
nothing
.
<EOS>
Lord
George
,
at
any
rate
,
did
not
conceive
himself
to
be
in
a
position
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
Had
there
not
been
something
crooked
about
Lizzie
,
 
a
screw
loose
,
as
people
say
,
 
she
would
never
have
been
within
his
reach
.
<EOS>
There
are
men
who
always
ride
lame
horses
,
and
yet
see
as
much
of
the
hunting
as
others
.
<EOS>
Lord
George
,
when
he
had
begun
to
think
that
,
after
the
tale
which
he
had
forced
her
to
tell
him
,
she
had
caused
the
diamonds
to
be
stolen
by
her
own
maid
out
of
her
own
desk
,
became
almost
afraid
of
her
.
<EOS>
But
now
,
as
he
looked
at
the
matter
again
and
again
,
he
believed
that
the
second
robbery
had
been
genuine
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
quite
make
up
his
mind
,
but
he
went
to
Hertford
Street
resolved
to
see
her
.
  
<EOS>
He
asked
for
her
,
and
was
shown
at
once
into
her
own
sitting
-
room
.
"
<EOS>
So
you
have
come
at
last
,
"
she
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
 
I
've
come
at
last
.
<EOS>
It
would
not
have
done
for
me
to
come
up
to
you
when
you
were
in
bed
.
<EOS>
Those
women
down
-
stairs
would
have
talked
about
it
everywhere
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
they
would
,
"
said
Lizzie
almost
piteously
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
would
n't
have
been
at
all
wise
after
all
that
has
been
said
.
<EOS>
People
would
have
been
sure
to
suspect
that
I
had
got
the
things
out
of
your
desk
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
no
;
 
not
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
n't
going
to
run
the
risk
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
His
manner
to
her
was
anything
but
civil
,
anything
but
complimentary
.
<EOS>
If
this
was
his
Corsair
humour
,
she
was
not
sure
that
a
Corsair
might
be
agreeable
to
her
.
"
<EOS>
And
now
tell
me
what
you
know
about
this
second
robbery
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
nothing
,
Lord
George
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
yes
,
you
do
.
<EOS>
You
know
something
.
<EOS>
You
know
,
at
any
rate
,
that
the
diamonds
were
there
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
 
I
know
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
that
they
were
taken
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
they
were
taken
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
sure
of
that
?
<EOS>
"
There
was
something
in
his
manner
absolutely
insolent
to
her
.
<EOS>
Frank
was
affectionate
,
and
even
Lord
Fawn
treated
her
with
deference
.
"
<EOS>
Because
,
you
know
,
you
have
been
very
clever
.
<EOS>
To
tell
you
the
truth
,
I
did
not
think
at
first
that
they
had
been
really
stolen
.
<EOS>
It
might
,
you
know
,
have
been
a
little
game
to
get
them
out
of
your
own
hands
,
 
between
you
and
your
maid
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
what
you
take
me
for
,
Lord
George
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
take
you
for
a
lady
who
,
for
a
long
time
,
got
the
better
of
the
police
and
the
magistrates
,
and
who
managed
to
shift
all
the
trouble
off
your
own
shoulders
on
to
those
of
other
people
.
<EOS>
You
have
heard
that
they
have
taken
one
of
the
thieves
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
they
have
got
the
girl
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Have
they
?
<EOS>
I
did
n't
know
that
.
<EOS>
That
scoundrel
Benjamin
has
levanted
too
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Levanted
!
"
<EOS>
said
Lizzie
,
raising
both
her
hands
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
an
hour
too
soon
,
my
lady
.
<EOS>
And
now
what
do
you
mean
to
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
ought
I
to
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
the
whole
truth
will
come
out
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Must
it
come
out
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Not
a
doubt
of
that
.
<EOS>
How
can
it
be
helped
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
wo
n't
tell
.
<EOS>
You
promised
that
you
would
not
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Psha
;
 
promised
!
<EOS>
If
they
put
me
in
a
witness
-
box
of
course
I
must
tell
.
<EOS>
When
you
come
to
this
kind
of
work
,
promises
do
n't
go
for
much
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
that
they
ever
do
.
<EOS>
What
is
a
broken
promise
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
story
,
"
said
Lizzie
,
in
innocent
amazement
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
what
was
it
you
told
when
you
were
upon
your
oath
at
Carlisle
;
and
again
when
the
magistrate
came
here
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Lord
George
;
 
<EOS>
how
unkind
you
are
to
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Patience
Crabstick
will
tell
it
all
,
without
any
help
from
me
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
see
that
the
whole
thing
must
be
known
?
<EOS>
She
'll
say
where
the
diamonds
were
found
;
 
and
how
did
they
come
there
,
if
you
did
n't
put
them
there
?
<EOS>
As
for
telling
,
there
'll
be
telling
enough
.
<EOS>
You
've
only
two
things
to
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
are
they
,
Lord
George
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Go
off
,
like
Mr.
Benjamin
;
or
else
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
.
<EOS>
Send
for
John
Eustace
and
tell
him
the
whole
.
<EOS>
For
his
brother
's
sake
he
'll
make
the
best
of
it
.
<EOS>
It
will
all
be
published
,
and
then
,
perhaps
,
there
will
be
an
end
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
could
n't
do
that
,
Lord
George
!
"
said
Lizzie
,
bursting
into
tears
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
ask
me
,
and
I
can
only
tell
you
what
I
think
.
<EOS>
That
you
should
be
able
to
keep
the
history
of
the
diamonds
a
secret
,
does
not
seem
to
me
to
be
upon
the
cards
.
<EOS>
No
doubt
people
who
are
rich
,
and
are
connected
with
rich
people
,
and
have
great
friends
,
 
who
are
what
the
world
call
swells
,
 
have
great
advantages
over
their
inferiors
when
they
get
into
trouble
.
<EOS>
You
are
the
widow
of
a
baronet
,
and
you
have
an
uncle
a
bishop
,
and
another
a
dean
,
and
a
countess
for
an
aunt
.
<EOS>
You
have
a
brother
-
in
-
law
and
a
first
-
cousin
in
Parliament
,
and
your
father
was
an
admiral
.
<EOS>
The
other
day
you
were
engaged
to
marry
a
peer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
yes
,
"
said
Lizzie
,
"
and
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
Palliser
is
my
particular
friend
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
is
;
is
she
?
<EOS>
So
much
the
better
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
,
no
doubt
,
is
a
very
swell
among
swells
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
The
Duke
of
Omnium
would
do
anything
for
me
,
"
said
Lizzie
with
enthusiasm
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
were
nobody
,
you
would
,
of
course
,
be
indicted
for
perjury
,
and
would
go
to
prison
.
<EOS>
As
it
is
,
if
you
will
tell
all
your
story
to
one
of
your
swell
friends
,
I
think
it
very
likely
that
you
may
be
pulled
through
.
<EOS>
I
should
say
that
Mr.
Eustace
,
or
your
cousin
Greystock
,
would
be
the
best
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
could
n't
you
do
it
?
<EOS>
You
know
it
all
.
<EOS>
I
told
you
because
 
because
 
because
I
thought
you
would
be
the
kindest
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
told
me
,
my
dear
,
because
you
thought
it
would
not
matter
much
with
me
,
and
I
appreciate
the
compliment
.
<EOS>
I
can
do
nothing
for
you
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
near
enough
to
those
who
wear
wigs
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Lizzie
did
not
above
half
understand
him
,
 
did
not
at
all
understand
him
when
he
spoke
of
those
who
wore
wigs
,
and
was
quite
dark
to
his
irony
about
her
great
friends
;
 
but
she
did
perceive
that
he
was
in
earnest
in
recommending
her
to
confess
.
<EOS>
She
thought
about
it
for
a
moment
in
silence
,
and
the
more
she
thought
the
more
she
felt
that
she
could
not
do
it
.
<EOS>
Had
he
not
suggested
a
second
alternative
,
 
that
she
should
go
off
like
Mr.
Benjamin
?
<EOS>
It
might
be
possible
that
she
should
go
off
,
and
yet
be
not
quite
like
Mr.
Benjamin
.
<EOS>
In
that
case
ought
she
not
to
go
under
the
protection
of
her
Corsair
?
<EOS>
Would
not
that
be
the
proper
way
of
going
?
<EOS>
"
Might
I
not
go
abroad
,
 
just
for
a
time
?
<EOS>
"
she
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
so
let
it
blow
over
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Just
so
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
possible
that
you
might
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
Not
that
it
would
blow
over
altogether
.
<EOS>
Everybody
would
know
it
.
<EOS>
It
is
too
late
now
to
stop
the
police
,
and
if
you
meant
to
be
off
,
you
should
be
off
at
once
;
 
to
-
day
or
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
dear
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
,
there
's
no
saying
whether
they
will
let
you
go
.
<EOS>
You
could
start
now
,
this
moment
;
 
and
if
you
were
at
Dover
could
get
over
to
France
.
<EOS>
But
when
once
it
is
known
that
you
had
the
necklace
all
that
time
in
your
own
desk
,
any
magistrate
,
I
imagine
,
could
stop
you
.
<EOS>
You
'd
better
have
some
lawyer
you
can
trust
;
 
not
that
blackguard
Mopus
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lord
George
had
certainly
brought
her
no
comfort
.
<EOS>
When
he
told
her
that
she
might
go
at
once
if
she
chose
,
she
remembered
,
with
a
pang
of
agony
,
that
she
had
already
overdrawn
her
account
at
the
bankers
.
<EOS>
She
was
the
actual
possessor
of
an
income
of
four
thousand
pounds
a
year
,
and
now
,
in
her
terrible
strait
,
she
could
not
stir
because
she
had
no
money
with
which
to
travel
.
<EOS>
Had
all
things
been
well
with
her
,
she
could
,
no
doubt
,
have
gone
to
her
bankers
and
have
arranged
this
little
difficulty
.
<EOS>
But
as
it
was
,
she
could
not
move
,
because
her
purse
was
empty
.
  
<EOS>
Lord
George
sat
looking
at
her
,
and
thinking
whether
he
would
make
the
plunge
and
ask
her
to
be
his
wife
,
 
with
all
her
impediments
and
drawbacks
about
her
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
careful
to
reduce
her
to
such
a
condition
of
despair
,
that
she
would
undoubtedly
have
accepted
him
,
so
that
she
might
have
some
one
to
lean
upon
in
her
trouble
;
 
but
,
as
he
looked
at
her
,
he
doubted
.
<EOS>
She
was
such
a
mass
of
deceit
,
that
he
was
afraid
of
her
.
<EOS>
She
might
say
that
she
would
marry
him
,
and
then
,
when
the
storm
was
over
,
refuse
to
keep
her
word
.
<EOS>
She
might
be
in
debt
,
 
almost
to
any
amount
.
<EOS>
She
might
be
already
married
,
for
anything
that
he
knew
.
<EOS>
He
did
know
that
she
was
subject
to
all
manner
of
penalties
for
what
she
had
done
.
<EOS>
He
looked
at
her
,
and
told
himself
that
she
was
very
pretty
.
<EOS>
But
in
spite
of
her
beauty
,
his
judgment
went
against
her
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
dare
to
share
even
his
boat
with
so
dangerous
a
fellow
-
passenger
.
<EOS>
"
That
's
my
advice
,
"
he
said
,
getting
up
from
his
chair
.
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
going
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
;
 
yes
;
I
do
n't
know
what
else
I
can
do
for
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
so
unkind
!
"
<EOS>
He
shrugged
his
shoulders
,
just
touched
her
hand
,
and
left
the
room
without
saying
another
word
to
her
.
   
<EOS>
Lizzie
's
Last
Scheme
 
Lizzie
,
when
she
was
left
alone
,
was
very
angry
with
the
Corsair
,
 
in
truth
,
more
sincerely
angry
than
she
had
ever
been
with
any
of
her
lovers
,
or
,
perhaps
,
with
any
human
being
.
<EOS>
Sincere
,
true
,
burning
wrath
was
not
the
fault
to
which
she
was
most
exposed
.
<EOS>
She
could
snap
and
snarl
,
and
hate
,
and
say
severe
things
;
she
could
quarrel
,
and
fight
,
and
be
malicious
;
 
but
to
be
full
of
real
wrath
was
uncommon
with
her
.
<EOS>
Now
she
was
angry
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
civil
,
more
than
civil
,
to
Lord
George
.
<EOS>
She
had
opened
her
house
to
him
,
and
her
heart
.
<EOS>
She
had
told
him
her
great
secret
.
<EOS>
She
had
implored
his
protection
.
<EOS>
She
had
thrown
herself
into
his
arms
.
<EOS>
And
now
he
had
rejected
her
.
<EOS>
That
he
should
have
been
rough
to
her
<EOS>
was
only
in
accordance
with
the
poetical
attributes
which
she
had
attributed
to
him
.
<EOS>
But
his
roughness
should
have
been
streaked
with
tenderness
.
<EOS>
He
should
not
have
left
her
roughly
.
<EOS>
In
the
whole
interview
he
had
not
said
a
loving
word
to
her
.
<EOS>
He
had
given
her
advice
,
 
which
might
be
good
or
bad
,
 
but
he
had
given
it
as
to
one
whom
he
despised
.
<EOS>
He
had
spoken
to
her
throughout
the
interview
exactly
as
he
might
have
spoken
to
Sir
Griffin
Tewett
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
analyse
her
feelings
thoroughly
,
but
she
felt
that
because
of
what
had
passed
between
them
,
by
reason
of
his
knowledge
of
her
secret
,
he
had
robbed
her
of
all
that
observance
which
was
due
to
her
as
a
woman
and
a
lady
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
roughly
used
before
,
 
by
people
of
inferior
rank
who
had
seen
through
her
ways
.
<EOS>
Andrew
Gowran
had
insulted
her
.
<EOS>
Patience
Crabstick
had
argued
with
her
.
<EOS>
Benjamin
,
the
employer
of
thieves
,
had
been
familiar
with
her
.
<EOS>
But
hitherto
,
in
what
she
was
pleased
to
call
her
own
set
,
she
had
always
been
treated
with
that
courtesy
which
ladies
seldom
fail
to
receive
.
<EOS>
She
understood
it
all
.
<EOS>
She
knew
how
much
of
mere
word
-
service
there
often
is
in
such
complimentary
usage
.
<EOS>
But
,
nevertheless
,
it
implies
respect
,
and
an
acknowledgement
of
the
position
of
her
who
is
so
respected
.
<EOS>
Lord
George
had
treated
her
as
one
schoolboy
treats
another
.
  
<EOS>
And
he
had
not
spoken
to
her
one
word
of
love
.
<EOS>
Love
will
excuse
roughness
.
<EOS>
Spoken
love
will
palliate
even
spoken
roughness
.
<EOS>
Had
he
once
called
her
his
own
Lizzie
,
he
might
have
scolded
her
as
he
pleased
,
 
might
have
abused
her
to
the
top
of
his
bent
.
<EOS>
But
as
there
had
been
nothing
of
the
manner
of
a
gentleman
to
a
lady
,
so
also
had
there
been
nothing
of
the
lover
to
his
mistress
.
<EOS>
That
dream
was
over
.
<EOS>
Lord
George
was
no
longer
a
Corsair
,
but
a
brute
.
  
<EOS>
But
what
should
she
do
?
<EOS>
Even
a
brute
may
speak
truth
.
<EOS>
She
was
to
have
gone
to
a
theatre
that
evening
with
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
but
she
stayed
at
home
thinking
over
her
position
.
<EOS>
She
heard
nothing
throughout
the
day
from
the
police
;
and
she
made
up
her
mind
that
,
unless
she
were
stopped
by
the
police
,
she
would
go
to
Scotland
on
the
day
but
one
following
.
<EOS>
She
thought
that
she
was
sure
that
she
would
do
so
;
but
,
of
course
,
she
must
be
guided
by
events
as
they
occurred
.
<EOS>
She
wrote
,
however
,
to
Miss
Macnulty
saying
that
she
would
come
,
and
she
told
Mrs.
Carbuncle
of
her
proposed
journey
as
that
lady
was
leaving
the
house
for
the
theatre
.
<EOS>
On
the
following
morning
,
however
,
news
came
which
again
made
her
journey
doubtful
.
<EOS>
There
was
another
paragraph
in
the
newspaper
about
the
robbery
,
acknowledging
the
former
paragraph
to
have
been
in
some
respect
erroneous
.
<EOS>
The
"
accomplished
housebreaker
"
had
not
been
arrested
.
<EOS>
A
confederate
of
the
"
accomplished
housebreaker
"
was
in
the
hands
of
the
police
,
and
the
police
were
on
the
track
of
the
"
accomplished
housebreaker
"
himself
.
<EOS>
Then
there
was
a
line
or
two
alluding
in
a
very
mysterious
way
to
the
disappearance
of
a
certain
jeweller
.
<EOS>
Taking
it
altogether
,
Lizzie
thought
that
there
was
ground
for
hope
,
 
and
that
,
at
any
rate
,
there
would
be
delay
.
<EOS>
She
would
,
perhaps
,
put
off
going
to
Scotland
for
yet
a
day
or
two
.
<EOS>
Was
it
not
necessary
that
she
should
wait
for
Lord
Fawn
's
answer
;
and
would
it
not
be
incumbent
on
her
cousin
Frank
to
send
her
some
account
of
himself
after
the
abrupt
manner
in
which
he
had
left
her
?
  
<EOS>
If
in
real
truth
she
should
be
driven
to
tell
her
story
to
any
one
,
 
and
she
began
to
think
that
she
was
so
driven
,
 
she
would
tell
it
to
him
.
<EOS>
She
believed
more
in
his
regard
for
her
than
that
of
any
other
human
being
.
<EOS>
She
thought
that
he
would
,
in
truth
,
have
been
devoted
to
her
,
had
he
not
become
entangled
with
that
wretched
little
governess
.
<EOS>
And
she
thought
that
if
he
could
see
his
way
out
of
that
scrape
,
he
would
marry
her
even
yet
,
 
would
marry
her
,
and
be
good
to
her
,
so
that
her
dream
of
a
poetical
phase
of
life
should
not
be
altogether
dissolved
.
<EOS>
After
all
,
the
diamonds
were
her
own
.
<EOS>
She
had
not
stolen
them
.
<EOS>
When
perplexed
in
the
extreme
by
magistrates
and
policemen
,
with
nobody
near
her
whom
she
trusted
to
give
her
advice
,
 
for
Lizzie
now
of
course
declared
to
herself
that
she
had
never
for
a
moment
trusted
the
Corsair
,
 
she
had
fallen
into
an
error
,
and
said
what
was
not
true
.
<EOS>
As
she
practised
it
before
the
glass
,
she
thought
that
she
could
tell
her
story
in
a
becoming
manner
,
with
becoming
tears
,
to
Frank
Greystock
.
<EOS>
And
were
it
not
for
Lucy
Morris
,
she
thought
that
he
would
take
her
with
all
her
faults
and
all
her
burthens
.
  
<EOS>
As
for
Lord
Fawn
,
she
knew
well
enough
that
,
let
him
write
what
he
would
,
and
renew
his
engagement
in
what
most
formal
manner
might
be
possible
,
he
would
be
off
again
when
he
learned
the
facts
as
to
that
night
at
Carlisle
.
<EOS>
She
had
brought
him
to
succumb
,
because
he
could
no
longer
justify
his
treatment
of
her
by
reference
to
the
diamonds
.
<EOS>
But
when
once
all
the
world
should
know
that
she
had
twice
perjured
herself
,
his
justification
would
be
complete
,
 
and
his
escape
would
be
certain
.
<EOS>
She
would
use
his
letter
simply
to
achieve
that
revenge
which
she
had
promised
herself
.
<EOS>
Her
effort
,
 
her
last
final
effort
,
 
must
be
made
to
secure
the
hand
and
heart
of
her
cousin
Frank
.
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
"
tis
his
heart
<EOS>
I
want
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
said
to
herself
.
  
<EOS>
She
must
settle
something
before
she
went
to
Scotland
,
 
if
there
was
anything
that
could
be
settled
.
<EOS>
If
she
could
only
get
a
promise
from
Frank
before
all
her
treachery
had
been
exposed
,
he
probably
would
remain
true
to
his
promise
.
<EOS>
He
would
not
desert
her
as
Lord
Fawn
had
done
.
<EOS>
Then
,
after
much
thinking
of
it
,
she
resolved
upon
a
scheme
which
,
of
all
her
schemes
,
was
the
wickedest
.
<EOS>
Whatever
it
might
cost
her
,
she
would
create
a
separation
between
Frank
Greystock
and
Lucy
Morris
.
<EOS>
Having
determined
upon
this
,
she
wrote
to
Lucy
,
asking
her
to
call
in
Hertford
Street
at
a
certain
hour
.
  
<EOS>
DEAR
LUCY
,
  
<EOS>
I
particularly
want
to
see
you
,
 
on
business
.
<EOS>
Pray
come
to
me
at
twelve
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
I
will
send
the
carriage
for
you
,
and
it
will
take
you
back
again
.
<EOS>
Pray
do
this
.
<EOS>
We
used
to
love
one
another
,
and
I
am
sure
I
love
you
still
.
  
<EOS>
Your
affectionate
old
friend
,
  
LIZZIE
.
  
<EOS>
As
a
matter
of
course
Lucy
went
to
her
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
,
before
the
interview
,
studied
the
part
she
was
to
play
with
all
possible
care
,
 
even
to
the
words
which
she
was
to
use
.
<EOS>
The
greeting
was
at
first
kindly
,
for
Lucy
had
almost
forgotten
the
bribe
that
had
been
offered
to
her
,
and
had
quite
forgiven
it
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
Eustace
never
could
be
dear
to
her
;
but
,
 
<EOS>
so
Lucy
had
thought
during
her
happiness
,
 
this
former
friend
of
hers
was
the
cousin
of
the
man
who
was
to
be
her
husband
,
and
was
dear
to
him
.
<EOS>
Of
course
she
had
forgiven
the
offence
.
"
<EOS>
And
now
,
dear
,
I
want
to
ask
you
a
question
,
"
Lizzie
said
;
"
or
rather
,
perhaps
not
a
question
.
<EOS>
I
can
do
it
better
than
that
.
<EOS>
I
think
that
my
cousin
Frank
once
talked
of
 
of
making
you
his
wife
.
"
<EOS>
Lucy
answered
not
a
word
,
but
she
trembled
in
every
limb
,
and
the
colour
came
to
her
face
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Was
it
not
so
,
dear
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
if
it
was
?
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
why
you
should
ask
me
any
question
like
that
about
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
he
not
my
cousin
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
 
he
is
your
cousin
.
<EOS>
Why
do
n't
you
ask
him
?
<EOS>
You
see
him
every
day
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nearly
every
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
do
you
send
for
me
,
then
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
so
hard
to
tell
you
,
Lucy
.
<EOS>
I
have
sent
to
you
in
good
faith
,
and
in
love
.
<EOS>
I
could
have
gone
to
you
,
 
only
for
the
old
vulture
,
who
would
not
have
let
us
had
a
word
in
peace
.
<EOS>
I
do
see
him
 
constantly
.
<EOS>
And
I
love
him
dearly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
nothing
to
me
,
"
said
Lucy
.
<EOS>
Anybody
hearing
them
,
and
not
knowing
them
,
would
have
said
that
Lucy
's
manner
was
harsh
in
the
extreme
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
has
told
me
everything
.
"
<EOS>
Lizzie
,
when
she
said
this
,
paused
,
looking
at
her
victim
.
"
<EOS>
He
has
told
me
things
which
he
could
not
mention
to
you
.
<EOS>
It
was
only
yesterday
,
 
the
day
before
yesterday
,
 
that
he
was
speaking
to
me
of
his
debts
.
<EOS>
I
offered
to
place
all
that
I
have
at
his
disposal
,
so
as
to
free
him
,
but
he
would
not
take
my
money
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
he
would
not
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
my
money
alone
.
<EOS>
Then
he
told
me
that
he
was
engaged
to
you
.
<EOS>
He
had
never
told
me
before
,
but
yet
I
knew
it
.
<EOS>
It
all
came
out
then
.
<EOS>
Lucy
,
though
he
is
engaged
to
you
,
it
is
me
that
he
loves
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
believe
it
,
"
said
Lucy
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
ca
n't
make
me
angry
,
Lucy
,
because
my
heart
bleeds
for
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nonsense
!
<EOS>
trash
!
<EOS>
I
do
n't
want
your
heart
to
bleed
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
believe
you
've
got
a
heart
.
<EOS>
You
've
got
money
;
I
know
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
he
has
got
none
.
<EOS>
If
I
did
not
love
him
,
why
should
I
wish
to
give
him
all
that
I
have
?
<EOS>
Is
not
that
disinterested
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
.
<EOS>
You
are
always
thinking
of
yourself
.
<EOS>
You
could
n't
be
disinterested
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
of
whom
are
you
thinking
?
<EOS>
Are
you
doing
the
best
for
him
,
 
a
man
in
his
position
,
without
money
,
ambitious
,
sure
to
succeed
if
want
of
money
does
not
stop
him
,
 
in
wishing
him
to
marry
a
girl
with
nothing
?
<EOS>
Can
not
I
do
more
for
him
than
you
can
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
could
work
for
him
on
my
knees
,
I
love
him
so
truly
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Would
that
do
him
any
service
?
<EOS>
He
can
not
marry
you
.
<EOS>
Does
he
ever
see
you
?
<EOS>
Does
he
write
to
you
as
though
you
were
to
be
his
wife
?
<EOS>
Do
you
not
know
that
it
is
all
over
?
 
<EOS>
that
it
must
be
over
?
<EOS>
It
is
impossible
that
he
should
marry
you
.
<EOS>
But
if
you
will
give
him
back
his
word
,
he
shall
be
my
husband
,
and
shall
have
all
that
I
possess
.
<EOS>
Now
,
let
us
see
who
loves
him
best
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
!
"
said
Lucy
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
will
you
show
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
no
need
that
I
should
show
it
.
<EOS>
He
knows
it
.
<EOS>
The
only
one
in
the
world
to
whom
I
wish
it
to
be
known
,
knows
it
already
well
enough
.
<EOS>
Did
you
send
for
me
for
this
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
 
for
this
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
for
him
to
tell
me
the
tidings
;
 
not
for
you
.
<EOS>
You
are
nothing
to
me
;
 
nothing
.
<EOS>
And
what
you
say
to
me
now
is
all
for
yourself
,
 
not
for
him
.
<EOS>
But
it
is
true
that
he
does
not
see
me
.
<EOS>
It
is
true
that
he
does
not
write
to
me
.
<EOS>
You
may
tell
him
from
me
,
 
for
I
can
not
write
to
him
myself
,
 
that
he
may
do
whatever
is
best
for
him
.
<EOS>
But
if
you
tell
him
that
I
do
not
love
him
better
than
all
the
world
,
you
will
lie
to
him
.
<EOS>
And
if
you
say
that
he
loves
you
better
than
he
does
me
,
that
also
will
be
a
lie
.
<EOS>
I
know
his
heart
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
Lucy
 
"
  
"
I
will
hear
no
more
.
<EOS>
He
can
do
as
he
pleases
.
<EOS>
If
money
be
more
to
him
than
love
and
honesty
,
let
him
marry
you
.
<EOS>
I
shall
never
trouble
him
;
he
may
be
sure
of
that
.
<EOS>
As
for
you
,
Lizzie
,
I
hope
that
we
may
never
meet
again
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
would
not
get
into
the
Eustace
-
Carbuncle
carriage
,
which
was
waiting
for
her
at
the
door
,
but
walked
back
to
Bruton
Street
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
doubt
but
that
it
was
all
over
with
her
now
.
<EOS>
That
Lizzie
Eustace
was
an
inveterate
liar
,
she
knew
well
;
but
she
did
believe
that
the
liar
had
on
this
occasion
been
speaking
truth
.
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
was
not
a
liar
,
and
Lady
Fawn
had
told
her
the
same
.
<EOS>
And
,
had
she
wanted
more
evidence
,
did
not
her
lover
's
conduct
give
it
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
It
is
because
I
am
poor
,
"
she
said
to
herself
,
 
"
for
I
know
well
that
he
loves
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
Tribute
 
<EOS>
Lizzie
put
off
her
journey
to
Scotland
from
day
to
day
,
though
her
cousin
Frank
continually
urged
upon
her
the
expediency
of
going
.
<EOS>
There
were
various
reasons
,
he
said
,
why
she
should
go
.
<EOS>
Her
child
was
there
,
and
it
was
proper
that
she
should
be
with
her
child
.
<EOS>
She
was
living
at
present
with
people
whose
reputation
did
not
stand
high
,
 
and
as
to
whom
all
manner
of
evil
reports
were
flying
about
the
town
.
<EOS>
It
was
generally
thought
,
 
so
said
Frank
,
 
that
that
Lord
George
de
Bruce
Carruthers
had
assisted
Mr.
Benjamin
in
stealing
the
diamonds
,
and
Frank
himself
did
not
hesitate
to
express
his
belief
in
the
accusation
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
no
,
that
can
not
be
,
"
said
Lizzie
,
trembling
.
<EOS>
But
,
though
she
rejected
the
supposition
,
she
did
not
reject
it
very
firmly
.
"
<EOS>
And
then
,
you
know
,
"
continued
Lizzie
,
"
I
never
see
him
.
<EOS>
I
have
actually
only
set
eyes
on
him
once
since
the
second
robbery
,
and
then
just
for
a
minute
.
<EOS>
Of
course
,
I
used
to
know
him
,
 
down
at
Portray
,
 
<EOS>
but
now
we
are
strangers
.
<EOS>
"
Frank
went
on
with
his
objections
.
<EOS>
He
declared
that
the
manner
in
which
Mrs.
Carbuncle
had
got
up
the
match
between
Lucinda
Roanoke
and
Sir
Griffin
was
shameful
,
 
all
the
world
was
declaring
that
it
was
shameful
,
 
that
she
had
not
a
penny
,
that
the
girl
was
an
adventurer
,
and
that
Sir
Griffin
was
an
obstinate
,
pig
-
headed
,
ruined
idiot
.
<EOS>
It
was
expedient
on
every
account
that
Lizzie
should
take
herself
away
from
that
"
lot
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
answer
that
Lizzie
desired
to
make
was
very
simple
.
<EOS>
Let
me
go
as
your
betrothed
bride
,
and
I
will
start
to
-
morrow
,
 
to
Scotland
or
elsewhere
,
as
you
may
direct
.
<EOS>
Let
that
little
affair
be
settled
,
and
I
shall
be
quite
as
willing
to
get
out
of
London
as
you
can
be
to
send
me
.
<EOS>
But
I
am
in
such
a
peck
of
troubles
that
something
must
be
settled
.
<EOS>
And
as
it
seems
that
after
all
the
police
are
still
astray
about
the
necklace
,
perhaps
I
need
n't
run
away
from
them
for
a
little
while
even
yet
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
say
this
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
even
in
<EOS>
so
many
words
make
the
first
proposition
.
<EOS>
But
she
did
endeavour
to
make
Frank
understand
that
she
would
obey
his
dictation
if
he
would
earn
the
right
to
dictate
.
<EOS>
He
either
did
not
or
would
not
understand
her
,
and
then
she
became
angry
with
him
,
 
or
pretended
to
be
angry
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Really
,
Frank
,
"
she
said
,
"
you
are
hardly
fair
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
In
what
way
am
I
unfair
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
come
here
and
abuse
all
my
friends
,
and
tell
me
to
go
here
and
go
there
,
just
as
though
I
were
a
child
.
<EOS>
And
 
and
 
and
 
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
what
,
Lizzie
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
what
I
mean
.
<EOS>
You
are
one
thing
one
day
,
and
one
another
.
<EOS>
I
hope
Miss
Lucy
Morris
was
quite
well
when
you
last
heard
from
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
no
right
to
speak
to
me
of
Lucy
,
 
at
least
,
not
in
disparagement
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
treating
her
very
badly
;
 
you
know
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
why
do
n't
you
give
it
up
?
<EOS>
Why
do
n't
you
let
her
have
her
chances
,
 
to
do
what
she
can
with
them
?
<EOS>
You
know
very
well
that
you
ca
n't
marry
her
.
<EOS>
You
know
that
you
ought
not
to
have
asked
her
.
<EOS>
You
talk
of
Miss
Roanoke
and
Sir
Griffin
Tewett
.
<EOS>
There
are
people
quite
as
bad
as
Sir
Griffin
,
 
or
Mrs.
Carbuncle
either
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
suppose
I
am
speaking
for
myself
.
<EOS>
I
've
given
up
all
that
idle
fancy
long
ago
.
<EOS>
I
shall
never
marry
a
second
time
myself
.
<EOS>
I
have
made
up
my
mind
to
that
.
<EOS>
I
have
suffered
too
much
already
.
<EOS>
"
Then
she
burst
into
tears
.
  
<EOS>
He
dried
her
tears
and
comforted
her
,
and
forgave
all
the
injurious
things
she
had
said
of
him
.
<EOS>
It
is
almost
impossible
for
a
man
,
 
a
man
under
forty
and
unmarried
,
and
who
is
not
a
philosopher
,
 
to
have
familiar
and
affectionate
intercourse
with
a
beautiful
young
woman
,
and
carry
it
on
as
he
might
do
with
a
friend
of
the
other
sex
.
<EOS>
In
his
very
heart
Greystock
despised
this
woman
;
he
had
told
himself
over
and
over
again
that
were
there
no
Lucy
in
the
case
he
would
not
marry
her
;
that
she
was
affected
,
unreal
,
 
and
,
in
fact
,
a
liar
in
every
word
and
look
and
motion
which
came
from
her
with
premeditation
.
<EOS>
Judging
,
not
from
her
own
account
,
but
from
circumstances
as
he
saw
them
and
such
evidence
as
had
reached
him
,
he
did
not
condemn
her
in
reference
to
the
diamonds
.
<EOS>
He
had
never
for
a
moment
conceived
that
she
had
secreted
them
.
<EOS>
He
acquitted
her
altogether
from
those
special
charges
which
had
been
widely
circulated
against
her
;
but
,
nevertheless
,
he
knew
her
to
be
heartless
and
bad
.
<EOS>
He
had
told
himself
a
dozen
times
that
it
would
be
well
for
him
that
she
should
be
married
and
taken
out
of
his
hands
.
<EOS>
And
yet
he
loved
her
after
a
fashion
,
and
was
prone
to
sit
near
her
,
and
was
fool
enough
to
be
flattered
by
her
caresses
.
<EOS>
When
she
would
lay
her
hand
on
his
arm
,
a
thrill
of
pleasure
went
through
him
.
<EOS>
And
yet
he
would
willingly
have
seen
any
decent
man
take
her
and
marry
her
,
making
a
bargain
that
he
should
never
see
her
again
.
<EOS>
Young
or
old
,
men
are
apt
to
become
Merlins
when
they
encounter
Viviens
.
<EOS>
On
this
occasion
he
left
her
,
disgusted
indeed
,
but
not
having
told
her
that
he
was
disgusted
.
<EOS>
"
Come
again
,
Frank
,
to
-
morrow
,
wo
n't
you
?
"
<EOS>
she
said
.
<EOS>
He
made
her
no
promise
as
he
went
,
nor
had
she
expected
it
.
<EOS>
He
had
left
her
quite
abruptly
the
other
day
,
and
he
now
went
away
almost
in
the
same
fashion
.
<EOS>
But
she
was
not
surprised
.
<EOS>
She
understood
that
the
task
she
had
in
hand
was
one
very
difficult
to
be
accomplished
,
 
and
she
did
perceive
,
in
some
dark
way
,
that
,
good
as
her
acting
was
,
it
was
not
quite
good
enough
.
<EOS>
Lucy
held
her
ground
because
she
was
real
.
<EOS>
You
may
knock
about
a
diamond
,
and
not
even
scratch
it
;
whereas
paste
in
rough
usage
betrays
itself
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
,
with
all
her
self
-
assuring
protestations
,
knew
that
she
was
paste
,
and
knew
that
Lucy
was
real
stone
.
<EOS>
Why
could
she
not
force
herself
to
act
a
little
better
,
so
that
the
paste
might
be
as
good
as
the
stone
,
 
might
at
least
seem
to
be
as
good
?
<EOS>
"
If
he
despises
me
now
,
what
will
he
say
when
he
finds
it
all
out
?
"
<EOS>
she
asked
herself
.
  
<EOS>
As
for
Frank
Greystock
himself
,
though
he
had
quite
made
up
his
mind
about
Lizzie
Eustace
,
he
was
still
in
doubt
about
the
other
girl
.
<EOS>
At
the
present
moment
he
was
making
over
two
thousand
pounds
a
year
,
and
yet
was
more
in
debt
now
than
he
had
been
a
year
ago
.
<EOS>
When
he
attempted
to
look
at
his
affairs
,
he
could
not
even
remember
what
had
become
of
his
money
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
gamble
.
<EOS>
He
had
no
little
yacht
,
costing
him
about
six
hundred
a
year
.
<EOS>
He
kept
one
horse
in
London
,
and
one
only
.
<EOS>
He
had
no
house
.
<EOS>
And
when
he
could
spare
time
from
his
work
,
he
was
generally
entertained
at
the
houses
of
his
friends
.
<EOS>
And
yet
from
day
to
day
his
condition
seemed
to
become
worse
and
worse
.
<EOS>
It
was
true
that
he
never
thought
of
half
-
a
-
sovereign
;
that
in
calling
for
wine
at
his
club
he
was
never
influenced
by
the
cost
;
that
it
seemed
to
him
quite
rational
to
keep
a
cab
waiting
for
him
half
the
day
;
that
in
going
or
coming
he
never
calculated
expense
;
<EOS>
that
in
giving
an
order
to
a
tailor
he
never
dreamed
of
anything
beyond
his
own
comfort
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
when
he
recounted
with
pride
his
great
economies
,
reminding
himself
that
he
,
a
successful
man
,
with
a
large
income
and
no
family
,
kept
neither
hunters
,
nor
yacht
,
nor
moor
,
and
that
he
did
not
gamble
,
he
did
think
it
very
hard
that
he
should
be
embarrassed
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
embarrassed
,
and
in
that
condition
could
it
be
right
for
him
to
marry
a
girl
without
a
shilling
?
  
<EOS>
In
these
days
Mrs.
Carbuncle
was
very
urgent
with
her
friend
not
to
leave
London
till
after
the
marriage
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
had
given
no
promise
,
 
had
only
been
induced
to
promise
that
the
loan
of
one
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
should
not
be
held
to
have
any
bearing
on
the
wedding
present
to
be
made
to
Lucinda
.
<EOS>
That
could
be
got
on
credit
from
Messrs.
Harter
and
Benjamin
;
for
though
Mr.
Benjamin
was
absent
,
 
on
a
little
tour
through
Europe
in
search
of
precious
stones
in
the
cheap
markets
,
old
Mr.
Harter
suggested
,
 
the
business
went
on
the
same
as
ever
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
good
deal
of
consultation
about
the
present
,
and
Mrs.
Carbuncle
at
last
decided
,
no
doubt
with
the
concurrence
of
Miss
Roanoke
,
that
it
should
consist
simply
of
silver
forks
and
spoons
,
 
real
silver
as
far
as
the
money
would
go
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
herself
went
with
her
friend
to
select
the
articles
,
 
as
to
which
,
perhaps
,
we
shall
do
her
no
injustice
in
saying
that
a
ready
sale
,
should
such
a
lamentable
occurrence
ever
become
necessary
,
was
one
of
the
objects
which
she
had
in
view
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
's
investigations
as
to
the
quality
of
the
metal
quite
won
Mr.
Harter
's
respect
;
and
it
will
probably
be
thought
that
she
exacted
no
more
than
justice
,
 
seeing
that
the
thing
had
become
a
matter
of
bargain
,
 
in
demanding
that
the
thirty
-
five
pounds
should
be
stretched
to
fifty
,
because
the
things
were
bought
on
long
credit
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
Lizzie
,
"
Mrs.
Carbuncle
said
,
"
the
dear
girl
wo
n't
have
an
ounce
more
than
she
would
have
got
,
had
you
gone
into
another
sort
of
shop
with
thirty
-
five
sovereigns
in
your
hand
.
<EOS>
"
Lizzie
growled
,
but
Mrs.
Carbuncle
's
final
argument
was
conclusive
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
tell
you
what
we
'll
do
,
"
said
she
;
"
we
'll
take
thirty
pounds
down
in
ready
money
.
<EOS>
"
There
was
no
answer
to
be
made
to
so
reasonable
a
proposition
.
  
<EOS>
The
presents
to
be
made
to
Lucinda
were
very
much
thought
of
in
Hertford
Street
at
this
time
,
and
Lizzie
,
 
independently
of
any
feeling
that
she
might
have
as
to
her
own
contribution
,
 
did
all
she
could
to
assist
the
collection
of
tribute
.
<EOS>
It
was
quite
understood
that
as
a
girl
can
only
be
married
once
,
 
for
a
widow
's
chance
in
such
matters
<EOS>
amounts
to
but
little
,
 
everything
should
be
done
to
gather
toll
from
the
tax
-
payers
of
society
.
<EOS>
It
was
quite
fair
on
such
an
occasion
that
men
should
be
given
to
understand
that
something
worth
having
was
expected
,
 
no
trumpery
thirty
-
shilling
piece
of
crockery
,
no
insignificant
glass
bottle
,
or
fantastic
paper
-
knife
of
no
real
value
whatever
,
but
got
up
just
to
put
money
into
the
tradesmen
's
hands
.
<EOS>
To
one
or
two
elderly
gentlemen
upon
whom
Mrs.
Carbuncle
had
smiled
,
she
ventured
to
suggest
in
plain
words
that
a
cheque
was
the
most
convenient
cadeau
.
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
say
to
a
couple
of
sovereigns
?
"
<EOS>
one
sarcastic
old
gentleman
replied
,
upon
whom
probably
Mrs.
Carbuncle
had
not
smiled
enough
.
<EOS>
She
laughed
and
congratulated
her
sarcastic
friend
upon
his
joke
;
 
but
the
two
sovereigns
were
left
upon
the
table
,
and
went
to
swell
the
spoil
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
do
something
handsome
for
Lucinda
,
"
Lizzie
said
to
her
cousin
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
call
handsome
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
a
bachelor
and
a
Member
of
Parliament
.
<EOS>
Say
fifteen
pounds
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
be
 
---
if
I
do
!
"
<EOS>
said
Frank
,
who
was
beginning
to
be
very
much
disgusted
with
the
house
in
Hertford
Street
.
<EOS>
"
There
's
a
five
-
pound
note
,
and
you
may
do
what
you
please
with
it
.
"
<EOS>
Lizzie
gave
over
the
five
-
pound
note
,
 
the
identical
bit
of
paper
that
had
come
from
Frank
;
and
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
no
doubt
,
did
do
what
she
pleased
with
it
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
almost
a
quarrel
because
Lizzie
,
after
much
consideration
,
declared
that
she
did
not
see
her
way
to
get
a
present
from
the
Duke
of
Omnium
.
<EOS>
She
had
talked
so
much
to
Mrs.
Carbuncle
about
the
duke
,
that
Mrs.
Carbuncle
was
almost
justified
in
making
the
demand
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
n't
the
value
,
you
know
,
"
said
Mrs.
Carbuncle
;
"
neither
I
nor
Lucinda
would
think
of
that
;
but
it
would
look
so
well
to
have
the
dear
duke
's
name
on
something
.
"
<EOS>
Lizzie
declared
that
the
duke
was
unapproachable
on
such
subjects
.
<EOS>
"
There
you
're
wrong
,
"
said
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
<EOS>
"
I
happen
to
know
there
is
nothing
his
grace
likes
so
much
as
giving
wedding
presents
.
<EOS>
"
This
was
the
harder
upon
Lizzie
as
she
actually
did
succeed
in
saying
such
kind
things
about
Lucinda
,
that
Lady
Glencora
sent
Miss
Roanoke
the
prettiest
smelling
-
bottle
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
mean
to
say
you
've
given
a
present
to
the
future
Lady
Tewett
?
"
said
Madame
Max
Goesler
to
her
friend
.
<EOS>
"
Why
not
?
<EOS>
Sir
Griffin
ca
n't
hurt
me
.
<EOS>
When
one
begins
to
be
good
-
natured
,
why
should
n't
one
be
good
-
natured
all
round
?
"
<EOS>
Madame
Max
remarked
that
it
might
,
perhaps
,
be
preferable
to
put
an
end
to
good
-
nature
altogether
.
<EOS>
"
There
I
daresay
you
're
right
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
"
I
've
long
felt
that
making
presents
means
nothing
.
<EOS>
Only
if
one
has
a
lot
of
money
and
people
like
it
,
why
should
n't
one
?
<EOS>
I
've
made
so
many
to
people
<EOS>
I
hardly
ever
saw
that
one
more
to
Lady
Tewett
ca
n't
hurt
.
"
  
<EOS>
Perhaps
the
most
wonderful
affair
in
that
campaign
was
the
spirited
attack
which
Mrs.
Carbuncle
made
on
a
certain
Mrs.
Hanbury
Smith
,
who
for
the
last
six
or
seven
years
had
not
been
among
Mrs.
Carbuncle
's
more
intimate
friends
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Hanbury
Smith
lived
with
her
husband
in
Paris
,
but
before
her
marriage
had
known
Mrs.
Carbuncle
in
London
.
<EOS>
Her
father
,
Mr.
Bunbury
Jones
,
had
,
from
certain
causes
,
chosen
to
show
certain
civilities
to
Mrs.
Carbuncle
just
at
the
period
of
his
daughter
's
marriage
,
and
Mrs.
Carbuncle
being
perhaps
at
that
moment
well
supplied
with
ready
money
,
had
presented
a
marriage
present
.
<EOS>
From
that
to
this
present
day
Mrs.
Carbuncle
had
seen
nothing
of
Mrs.
Hanbury
Smith
,
nor
of
Mr.
Bunbury
Jones
,
but
she
was
not
the
woman
to
waste
the
return
-
value
of
such
a
transaction
.
<EOS>
A
present
so
given
was
<EOS>
seed
sown
in
the
earth
,
 
seed
,
indeed
,
<EOS>
that
could
not
be
expected
to
give
back
twenty
-
fold
,
or
even
ten
-
fold
,
but
still
seed
from
which
a
crop
should
be
expected
.
<EOS>
So
she
wrote
to
Mrs.
Hanbury
Smith
,
explaining
that
her
darling
niece
Lucinda
was
about
to
be
married
to
Sir
Griffin
Tewett
,
and
that
,
as
she
had
no
child
of
her
own
,
Lucinda
was
the
same
to
her
as
a
daughter
.
<EOS>
And
then
,
lest
there
might
be
any
want
of
comprehension
,
she
expressed
her
own
assurance
that
her
friend
would
be
glad
to
have
an
opportunity
of
reciprocating
the
feelings
which
had
been
evinced
on
the
occasion
of
her
own
marriage
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
no
good
mincing
matters
now
-
a
-
days
,
"
Mrs.
Carbuncle
would
have
said
,
had
any
friend
pointed
out
to
her
that
she
was
taking
strong
measures
in
the
exaction
of
toll
.
<EOS>
"
People
have
come
to
understand
that
a
spade
is
a
spade
,
and
£
10
,
£
10
,
"
she
would
have
said
.
<EOS>
Had
Mrs.
Hanbury
Smith
not
noticed
the
application
,
there
might
,
perhaps
,
have
been
an
end
of
it
,
but
she
was
silly
enough
to
send
over
from
Paris
a
little
trumpery
bit
of
finery
,
bought
in
the
Palais
Royal
for
ten
francs
.
<EOS>
Whereupon
Mrs.
Carbuncle
wrote
the
following
letter
:
    
MY
DEAR
MRS
.
<EOS>
HANBURY
SMITH
,
  
Lucinda
has
received
your
little
brooch
,
and
is
much
obliged
to
you
for
thinking
of
her
;
but
you
must
remember
that
when
you
were
married
,
I
sent
you
a
bracelet
which
cost
£
10
.
<EOS>
If
I
had
a
daughter
of
my
own
,
I
should
,
of
course
,
expect
that
she
would
reap
the
benefit
of
this
on
her
marriage
;
 
and
my
niece
is
the
same
to
me
as
a
daughter
.
<EOS>
I
think
that
this
is
quite
understood
now
among
people
in
society
.
<EOS>
Lucinda
will
be
disappointed
much
if
you
do
not
send
her
what
she
thinks
she
has
a
right
to
expect
.
<EOS>
Of
course
you
can
deduct
the
brooch
if
you
please
.
  
<EOS>
Yours
very
sincerely
,
  
JANE
CARBUNCLE
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Hanbury
Smith
was
something
of
a
wag
,
and
caused
his
wife
to
write
back
as
follows
:
    
DEAR
MRS
.
CARBUNCLE
,
  
<EOS>
I
quite
acknowledge
the
reciprocity
system
,
but
do
n't
think
it
extends
to
descendants
,
 
certainly
not
to
nieces
.
<EOS>
I
acknowledge
,
too
,
the
present
quoted
at
£
10
.
<EOS>
I
thought
it
had
been
£
7
10s
.
 
<EOS>
[
"
The
nasty
,
mean
creature
,
"
said
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
when
showing
the
correspondence
to
Lizzie
,
"
must
have
been
to
the
tradesman
to
inquire
!
<EOS>
The
price
named
was
£
10
,
but
I
got
£
2
<EOS>
l0s
.
<EOS>
off
for
ready
money
.
"
]
 
<EOS>
At
your
second
marriage
I
will
do
what
is
needful
;
but
I
can
assure
you
I
have
n't
recognised
nieces
with
any
of
my
friends
.
  
<EOS>
Yours
very
truly
,
  
CAROLINE
HANBURY
SMITH
.
  
<EOS>
The
correspondence
was
carried
no
further
,
for
not
even
can
a
Mrs.
Carbuncle
exact
payment
of
such
a
debt
in
any
established
court
;
but
she
inveighed
bitterly
against
the
meanness
of
Mrs.
Smith
,
telling
the
story
openly
,
and
never
feeling
that
she
told
it
against
herself
.
<EOS>
In
her
set
it
was
generally
thought
that
she
had
done
quite
right
.
  
<EOS>
She
managed
better
with
old
Mr.
Cabob
,
who
had
certainly
received
many
of
Mrs.
Carbuncle
's
smiles
,
and
who
was
very
rich
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Cabob
did
as
he
was
desired
,
and
sent
a
cheque
,
 
a
cheque
for
£
20
;
and
added
a
message
that
he
hoped
Miss
Roanoke
would
buy
with
it
any
little
thing
that
she
liked
.
<EOS>
Miss
Roanoke
,
 
or
her
aunt
for
her
,
 
liked
a
thirty
-
guinea
ring
,
and
bought
it
,
having
the
bill
for
the
balance
sent
in
to
Mr.
Cabob
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Cabob
,
who
probably
knew
that
he
must
pay
well
for
his
smiles
,
never
said
anything
about
it
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Eustace
went
into
all
this
work
,
absolutely
liking
it
.
<EOS>
She
had
felt
nothing
of
anger
even
as
regarded
her
own
contribution
,
 
much
as
she
had
struggled
to
reduce
the
amount
.
<EOS>
People
,
she
felt
,
ought
to
be
sharp
;
 
and
it
was
nice
to
look
at
pretty
things
,
and
to
be
cunning
about
them
.
<EOS>
She
would
have
applied
to
the
Duke
of
Omnium
had
she
dared
,
and
was
very
triumphant
when
she
got
the
smelling
-
bottle
from
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
But
Lucinda
herself
took
no
part
<EOS>
whatever
in
all
these
things
.
<EOS>
Nothing
that
Mrs.
Carbuncle
could
say
would
induce
her
to
take
any
interest
in
them
,
or
even
in
the
trousseau
,
which
,
without
reference
to
expense
,
was
being
supplied
chiefly
on
the
very
indifferent
credit
of
Sir
Griffin
.
<EOS>
What
Lucinda
had
to
say
about
the
matter
was
said
solely
to
her
aunt
.
<EOS>
Neither
Lady
Eustace
,
nor
Lord
George
,
nor
even
the
maid
who
dressed
her
,
heard
any
of
her
complaints
.
<EOS>
But
complain
she
did
,
and
that
with
terrible
energy
.
<EOS>
"
What
is
the
use
of
it
,
Aunt
Jane
?
<EOS>
I
shall
never
have
a
house
to
put
them
into
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
nonsense
,
my
dear
!
<EOS>
Why
should
n't
you
have
a
house
as
well
as
others
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
if
I
had
,
I
should
never
care
for
them
.
<EOS>
I
hate
them
.
<EOS>
What
does
Lady
Glencora
Palliser
or
Lord
Fawn
care
for
me
?
"
<EOS>
Even
Lord
Fawn
had
been
put
under
requisition
,
and
had
sent
a
little
box
full
of
stationery
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
are
worth
money
,
Lucinda
;
and
when
a
girl
marries
she
always
gets
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
 
and
when
they
come
from
people
who
love
her
,
and
who
pour
them
into
her
lap
with
kisses
,
because
she
has
given
herself
to
a
man
she
loves
,
then
it
must
be
nice
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
 
if
I
were
marrying
a
poor
man
,
and
a
poor
friend
had
given
me
a
gridiron
to
help
me
to
cook
my
husband
's
dinner
,
how
I
could
have
valued
it
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
that
you
like
poor
things
and
poor
people
better
than
anybody
else
,
"
said
Aunt
Jane
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
like
anything
or
anybody
,
"
said
Lucinda
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
had
better
take
the
good
things
that
come
to
you
,
then
;
and
not
grumble
.
<EOS>
How
I
have
worked
to
get
all
this
arranged
for
you
,
and
now
what
thanks
have
I
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
'll
find
you
have
worked
for
very
little
,
Aunt
Jane
.
<EOS>
I
shall
never
marry
the
man
yet
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
This
,
however
,
had
been
said
so
often
that
Aunt
Jane
thought
nothing
of
the
threat
.
   
<EOS>
The
Aspirations
of
Mr.
Emilius
 
<EOS>
It
was
acknowledged
by
Mrs.
Carbuncle
very
freely
that
in
the
matter
of
tribute
no
one
behaved
better
than
Mr.
Emilius
,
the
fashionable
,
foreign
,
ci
-
devant
Jew
preacher
,
who
still
drew
great
congregations
in
the
neighbourhood
of
Mrs.
Carbuncle
's
house
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
no
doubt
,
attended
regularly
at
Mr.
Emilius
's
church
,
and
had
taken
a
sitting
for
thirteen
Sundays
at
something
like
ten
shillings
a
Sunday
.
<EOS>
But
she
had
not
as
yet
paid
the
money
,
and
Mr.
Emilius
was
well
aware
that
if
his
tickets
were
not
paid
for
in
advance
,
there
would
be
considerable
defalcations
in
his
income
.
<EOS>
He
was
,
as
a
rule
,
very
particular
as
to
such
payments
,
and
would
not
allow
a
name
to
be
put
on
a
sitting
till
the
money
had
reached
his
pockets
;
but
with
Mrs.
Carbuncle
he
had
descended
to
no
such
commercial
accuracy
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
had
seats
for
three
,
 
for
one
of
which
Lady
Eustace
paid
her
share
in
advance
,
 
in
the
midst
of
the
very
best
pews
in
the
most
conspicuous
part
of
the
house
,
 
and
hardly
a
word
had
been
said
to
her
about
the
money
.
<EOS>
And
now
there
came
to
them
from
Mr.
Emilius
the
prettiest
little
gold
salver
that
ever
was
seen
.
<EOS>
"
I
send
Messrs.
Clerico
's
docket
,
"
wrote
Mr.
Emilius
,
"
as
Miss
Roanoke
may
like
to
know
the
quality
of
the
metal
.
"
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
"
said
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
inspecting
the
little
dish
,
and
putting
two
and
two
together
;
"
he
's
got
it
cheap
,
no
doubt
,
 
at
the
place
where
they
commissioned
him
to
buy
the
plate
and
candlesticks
for
the
church
;
but
at
£

<EOS>
Mr.
Emilius
no
doubt
had
had
his
outing
in
the
autumn
through
the
instrumentality
of
Mrs.
Carbuncle
's
kindness
;
but
that
was
past
and
gone
,
and
such
lavish
gratitude
for
a
past
favour
could
hardly
be
expected
from
Mr.
Emilius
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
be
hanged
if
he
is
n't
after
Portray
Castle
,
"
said
Mrs.
Carbuncle
to
herself
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Emilius
was
after
Portray
Castle
,
and
had
been
after
Portray
Castle
in
a
silent
,
not
very
confident
,
but
yet
not
altogether
hopeless
manner
ever
since
he
had
seen
the
glories
of
that
place
,
and
learned
something
of
truth
as
to
the
widow
's
income
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
was
led
to
her
conclusion
not
simply
by
the
wedding
present
,
but
in
part
also
by
the
diligence
displayed
by
Mr.
Emilius
in
removing
the
doubts
which
had
got
abroad
respecting
his
condition
in
life
.
<EOS>
He
assured
Mrs.
Carbuncle
that
he
had
never
been
married
.
<EOS>
Shortly
after
his
ordination
,
which
had
been
effected
under
the
hands
of
that
great
and
good
man
the
late
Bishop
of
Jerusalem
,
he
had
taken
to
live
with
him
a
lady
who
was
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
did
not
quite
recollect
who
the
lady
was
,
but
remembered
that
she
was
connected
in
some
way
with
a
step
-
mother
of
Mr.
Emilius
who
lived
in
Bohemia
.
<EOS>
This
lady
had
for
awhile
kept
house
for
Mr.
Emilius
;
 
but
ill
-
natured
things
had
been
said
,
and
Mr.
Emilius
,
having
respect
to
his
cloth
,
had
sent
the
poor
lady
back
to
Bohemia
.
<EOS>
The
consequence
was
that
he
now
lived
in
a
solitude
which
was
absolute
,
and
,
as
Mr.
Emilius
added
,
somewhat
melancholy
.
<EOS>
All
this
Mr.
Emilius
explained
very
fully
,
not
to
Lizzie
herself
,
but
to
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
<EOS>
If
Lady
Eustace
chose
to
entertain
such
a
suitor
,
why
should
he
not
come
?
<EOS>
It
was
nothing
to
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
  
<EOS>
Lizzie
laughed
when
she
was
told
that
she
might
add
the
reverend
gentleman
to
the
list
of
her
admirers
.
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
you
remember
,
"
she
said
,
"
how
we
used
to
chaff
Miss
Macnulty
about
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
knew
better
than
that
,
"
replied
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
no
saying
what
a
man
may
be
after
,
"
said
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
know
but
<EOS>
what
he
might
have
thought
that
Macnulty
's
connexions
would
increase
his
congregation
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
's
after
you
,
my
dear
,
and
your
income
.
<EOS>
He
can
manage
a
congregation
for
himself
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lizzie
was
very
civil
to
him
,
but
it
would
be
unjust
to
her
to
say
that
she
gave
him
any
encouragement
.
<EOS>
It
is
quite
the
proper
thing
for
a
lady
to
be
on
intimate
,
and
even
on
affectionate
,
terms
with
her
favourite
clergyman
,
and
Lizzie
certainly
had
intercourse
with
no
clergyman
who
was
a
greater
favourite
with
her
than
Mr.
Emilius
.
<EOS>
She
had
a
dean
for
an
uncle
,
and
a
bishop
for
an
uncle
-
in
-
law
;
but
she
was
at
no
pains
to
hide
her
contempt
for
these
old
fogies
of
the
Church
.
<EOS>
"
They
preach
now
and
then
in
the
cathedral
,
"
she
said
to
Mr.
Emilius
,
"
and
everybody
takes
the
opportunity
of
going
to
sleep
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Emilius
was
very
much
amused
at
this
description
of
the
eloquence
of
the
dignitaries
.
<EOS>
It
was
quite
natural
to
him
that
people
should
go
to
sleep
in
church
who
take
no
trouble
in
seeking
eloquent
preachers
.
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
"
he
said
,
"
the
Church
in
England
,
which
is
my
Church
,
 
the
Church
which
I
love
,
 
is
beautiful
.
<EOS>
She
is
as
a
maiden
,
all
glorious
with
fine
raiment
.
<EOS>
But
alas
!
<EOS>
she
is
mute
.
<EOS>
She
does
not
sing
.
<EOS>
She
has
no
melody
.
<EOS>
But
the
time
cometh
in
which
she
shall
sing
.
<EOS>
I
,
myself
,
 
<EOS>
I
am
a
poor
singer
in
the
great
choir
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
In
saying
which
Mr.
Emilius
no
doubt
intended
to
allude
to
his
eloquence
as
a
preacher
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
a
man
who
could
listen
as
well
as
sing
,
and
he
was
very
careful
to
hear
well
that
which
was
being
said
in
public
about
Lady
Eustace
and
her
diamonds
.
<EOS>
He
had
learned
thoroughly
what
was
her
condition
in
reference
to
the
Portray
estate
,
and
was
rejoiced
rather
than
otherwise
to
find
that
she
enjoyed
only
a
life
-
interest
in
the
property
.
<EOS>
Had
the
thing
been
better
than
it
was
<EOS>
,
it
would
have
been
the
further
removed
from
his
reach
.
<EOS>
And
in
the
same
way
,
when
rumours
reached
him
prejudicial
to
Lizzie
in
respect
of
the
diamonds
,
he
perceived
that
such
prejudice
might
work
weal
for
him
.
<EOS>
A
gentleman
once
,
on
ordering
a
mackerel
for
dinner
,
was
told
that
a
fresh
mackerel
would
come
to
a
shilling
.
<EOS>
He
could
have
a
stale
mackerel
for
sixpence
.
"
<EOS>
Then
bring
me
a
stale
mackerel
,
"
said
the
gentleman
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Emilius
coveted
fish
,
but
was
aware
that
his
position
did
not
justify
him
in
expecting
the
best
fish
on
the
market
.
<EOS>
The
Lord
Fawns
and
the
Frank
Greystocks
of
the
world
would
be
less
likely
to
covet
Lizzie
,
should
she
,
by
any
little
indiscretion
,
have
placed
herself
under
a
temporary
cloud
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Emilius
had
carefully
observed
the
heavens
,
and
knew
how
quickly
such
clouds
will
disperse
themselves
when
they
are
tinged
with
gold
.
<EOS>
There
was
nothing
which
Lizzie
had
done
,
or
would
be
likely
to
do
,
which
could
materially
affect
her
income
.
<EOS>
It
might
indeed
be
possible
that
the
Eustaces
should
make
her
pay
for
the
necklace
;
but
even
in
that
case
,
there
would
be
quite
enough
left
for
that
modest
,
unambitious
comfort
which
Mr.
Emilius
desired
.
<EOS>
It
was
by
preaching
,
and
not
by
wealth
,
that
he
must
make
himself
known
in
the
world
!
 
<EOS>
but
for
a
preacher
to
have
a
pretty
wife
with
a
title
and
a
good
income
,
 
and
a
castle
in
Scotland
,
 
what
an
Elysium
<EOS>
it
would
be
!
<EOS>
In
such
a
condition
he
would
envy
no
dean
,
no
bishop
,
 
no
archbishop
!
<EOS>
He
thought
a
great
deal
about
it
,
and
saw
no
positive
bar
to
his
success
.
  
<EOS>
She
told
him
that
she
was
going
to
Scotland
.
"
<EOS>
Not
immediately
!
"
he
exclaimed
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
little
boy
is
there
,
"
she
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
why
should
not
your
little
boy
be
here
?
<EOS>
Surely
,
for
people
who
can
choose
,
the
great
centre
of
the
world
offers
attractions
which
can
not
be
found
in
secluded
spots
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
love
seclusion
,
"
said
Lizzie
,
with
rapture
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
yes
;
I
can
believe
that
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Emilius
had
himself
witnessed
the
seclusion
of
Portray
Castle
,
and
had
heard
,
when
there
,
many
stories
of
the
Ayrshire
hunting
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
your
nature
;
 
but
,
dear
Lady
Eustace
,
will
you
allow
me
to
say
that
our
nature
is
implanted
in
us
in
accordance
with
the
Fall
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
you
mean
to
say
that
it
is
wicked
to
like
to
be
in
Scotland
better
than
in
this
giddy
town
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
say
nothing
about
wicked
,
Lady
Eustace
;
but
this
I
do
say
,
that
nature
alone
will
not
lead
us
always
aright
.
<EOS>
It
is
good
to
be
at
Portray
part
of
the
year
,
no
doubt
;
but
are
there
not
blessings
in
such
a
congregation
of
humanity
as
this
London
which
you
can
not
find
at
Portray
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
hear
you
preach
,
Mr.
Emilius
,
certainly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
that
is
something
,
too
,
Lady
Eustace
;
 
otherwise
a
great
many
people
who
kindly
come
to
hear
me
must
sadly
waste
their
time
.
<EOS>
And
your
example
to
the
world
around
;
 
is
it
not
more
serviceable
amidst
the
crowds
of
London
than
in
the
solitudes
of
Scotland
?
<EOS>
There
is
more
good
to
be
done
,
Lady
Eustace
,
by
living
among
our
fellow
-
creatures
than
by
deserting
them
.
<EOS>
Therefore
I
think
you
should
not
go
to
Scotland
before
August
,
but
should
have
your
little
boy
brought
to
you
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
air
of
his
native
mountains
is
everything
to
my
child
,
"
said
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
The
child
had
,
in
fact
,
been
born
at
Bobsborough
,
but
that
probably
would
make
no
real
difference
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
can
not
wonder
that
I
should
plead
for
your
stay
,
"
said
Mr.
Emilius
,
throwing
all
his
soul
into
his
eyes
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
How
dark
would
everything
be
to
me
if
I
missed
you
from
your
seat
in
the
house
of
praise
and
prayer
!
"
  
<EOS>
Lizzie
Eustace
,
like
some
other
ladies
who
ought
to
be
more
appreciative
,
was
altogether
deficient
in
what
may
perhaps
be
called
good
taste
in
reference
to
men
.
<EOS>
Though
she
was
clever
,
and
though
,
in
spite
of
her
ignorance
,
she
at
once
knew
an
intelligent
man
from
a
fool
,
she
did
not
know
the
difference
between
a
gentleman
and
a
 
"
cad
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
in
her
estimation
something
against
Mr.
Emilius
that
he
was
a
clergyman
,
something
against
him
that
he
had
nothing
but
<EOS>
what
he
earned
,
something
against
him
that
he
was
supposed
to
be
a
renegade
Jew
,
and
that
nobody
knew
whence
he
came
nor
who
he
was
.
<EOS>
These
deficiencies
or
drawbacks
Lizzie
recognised
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
nothing
against
him
in
her
judgment
that
he
was
a
greasy
,
fawning
,
pawing
,
creeping
,
black
-
browed
rascal
,
who
could
not
look
her
full
in
the
face
,
and
whose
every
word
sounded
like
a
lie
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
twang
in
his
voice
which
ought
to
have
told
her
that
he
was
utterly
untrustworthy
.
<EOS>
There
was
an
oily
pretence
at
earnestness
in
his
manner
which
ought
to
have
told
that
he
was
not
fit
to
associate
with
gentlemen
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
foulness
of
demeanour
about
him
which
ought
to
have
given
to
her
,
as
a
woman
at
any
rate
brought
up
among
ladies
,
an
abhorrence
of
his
society
.
<EOS>
But
all
this
Lizzie
did
not
feel
.
<EOS>
She
ridiculed
to
Mrs.
Carbuncle
the
idea
of
the
preacher
's
courtship
.
<EOS>
She
still
thought
that
in
the
teeth
of
all
her
misfortunes
she
could
do
better
with
herself
than
marry
Mr.
Emilius
.
<EOS>
She
conceived
that
the
man
must
be
impertinent
if
Mrs.
Carbuncle
's
assertions
were
true
;
 
but
she
was
neither
angry
nor
disgusted
,
and
she
allowed
him
to
talk
to
her
,
and
even
to
make
love
to
her
,
after
his
nasty
pseudo
-
clerical
fashion
.
  
<EOS>
She
could
surely
still
do
better
with
herself
than
marry
Mr.
Emilius
!
<EOS>
It
was
now
the
twentieth
of
March
,
and
a
fortnight
had
gone
since
an
intimation
had
been
sent
to
her
from
the
headquarters
of
the
police
that
Patience
Crabstick
was
in
their
hands
.
<EOS>
Nothing
further
had
occurred
,
and
it
might
be
that
Patience
Crabstick
had
told
no
tale
against
her
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
bring
herself
to
believe
that
Patience
had
no
tale
to
tell
,
but
it
might
be
that
Patience
,
though
she
was
in
the
hands
of
the
police
,
would
find
it
to
her
interest
to
tell
no
tale
against
her
late
mistress
.
<EOS>
At
any
rate
,
there
was
silence
and
quiet
,
and
the
affair
of
the
diamonds
seemed
almost
to
be
passing
out
of
people
's
minds
.
<EOS>
Greystock
had
twice
called
in
Scotland
Yard
,
but
had
been
able
to
learn
nothing
.
<EOS>
It
was
feared
,
they
said
,
that
the
people
really
engaged
in
the
robbery
<EOS>
had
got
away
scot
-
free
.
<EOS>
Frank
did
not
quite
believe
them
,
but
he
could
learn
nothing
from
them
.
<EOS>
Thus
encouraged
,
Lizzie
determined
that
she
would
remain
in
London
till
after
Lucinda
's
marriage
,
 
till
after
she
should
have
received
the
promised
letter
from
Lord
Fawn
,
as
to
which
,
though
it
was
so
long
in
coming
,
she
did
not
doubt
that
it
would
come
at
last
.
<EOS>
She
could
do
nothing
with
Frank
,
 
who
was
a
fool
!
<EOS>
She
could
do
nothing
with
Lord
George
,
 
who
was
a
brute
!
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
would
still
be
within
her
reach
,
if
only
the
secret
about
the
diamonds
could
be
kept
a
secret
till
after
she
should
have
become
his
wife
.
  
<EOS>
About
this
time
Lucinda
spoke
to
her
respecting
her
proposed
journey
.
<EOS>
"
You
were
talking
of
going
to
Scotland
a
week
ago
,
Lady
Eustace
.
"
  
"
And
am
still
talking
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Aunt
Jane
says
that
you
are
waiting
for
my
wedding
.
<EOS>
It
is
very
kind
of
you
;
 
but
pray
do
n't
do
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
n't
think
of
going
now
till
after
your
marriage
.
<EOS>
It
only
wants
ten
or
twelve
days
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
count
them
.
<EOS>
I
know
how
many
days
it
wants
.
<EOS>
It
may
want
more
than
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
ca
n't
put
it
off
now
,
I
should
think
,
"
said
Lizzie
;
"
and
as
I
have
ordered
my
dress
for
the
occasion
I
shall
certainly
stay
and
wear
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
sorry
for
your
dress
.
<EOS>
I
am
very
sorry
for
it
all
.
<EOS>
Do
you
know
;
 
<EOS>
I
sometimes
think
I
shall
 
murder
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Lucinda
,
 
how
can
you
say
anything
so
horrible
!
<EOS>
But
I
see
you
are
only
joking
.
<EOS>
"
There
did
come
a
ghastly
smile
over
that
beautiful
face
,
which
was
so
seldom
lighted
up
by
any
expression
of
mirth
or
good
humour
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
wish
you
would
not
say
such
horrible
things
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
would
serve
him
right
;
 
and
if
he
were
to
murder
me
,
that
would
serve
me
right
.
<EOS>
He
knows
that
I
detest
him
,
and
yet
he
goes
on
with
it
.
<EOS>
I
have
told
him
so
a
score
of
times
,
but
nothing
will
make
him
give
it
up
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
that
he
loves
me
,
but
he
thinks
that
that
will
be
his
triumph
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
do
n't
you
give
it
up
,
if
it
makes
you
unhappy
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
ought
to
come
from
him
,
 
ought
it
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
see
why
,
"
said
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
not
bound
to
anybody
as
I
am
bound
to
my
aunt
.
<EOS>
No
one
can
have
exacted
an
oath
from
him
.
<EOS>
Lady
Eustace
,
you
do
n't
quite
understand
how
we
are
situated
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
whether
you
would
take
the
trouble
to
be
good
to
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
Lucinda
Roanoke
had
never
asked
a
favour
of
her
before
;
 
had
never
,
to
Lizzie
's
knowledge
,
asked
a
favour
of
any
one
.
"
<EOS>
In
what
way
can
I
be
good
to
you
?
"
<EOS>
she
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
Make
him
give
it
up
.
<EOS>
You
may
tell
him
what
you
like
of
me
.
<EOS>
Tell
him
that
I
shall
only
make
him
miserable
,
and
more
despicable
than
he
is
;
 
that
I
shall
never
be
a
good
wife
to
him
.
<EOS>
Tell
him
that
I
am
thoroughly
bad
,
and
that
he
will
repent
it
to
the
last
day
of
his
life
.
<EOS>
Say
whatever
you
like
,
 
but
make
him
give
it
up
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
When
everything
has
been
prepared
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
does
all
that
signify
compared
to
a
life
of
misery
?
<EOS>
Lady
Eustace
,
I
really
think
that
I
should
 
kill
him
,
if
he
really
were
 
<EOS>
were
my
husband
.
<EOS>
"
Lizzie
at
last
said
that
she
would
,
at
any
rate
,
speak
to
Sir
Griffin
.
  
<EOS>
And
she
did
speak
to
Sir
Griffin
,
having
waited
three
or
four
days
for
an
opportunity
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
There
had
been
some
desperately
sharp
words
between
Sir
Griffin
and
Mrs.
Carbuncle
with
reference
to
money
.
<EOS>
Sir
Griffin
had
been
given
to
understand
that
Lucinda
had
,
or
would
have
,
some
few
hundred
pounds
,
and
insisted
that
the
money
should
be
handed
over
to
him
on
the
day
of
his
marriage
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
had
declared
that
the
money
was
to
come
from
property
to
be
realised
in
New
York
,
and
had
named
a
day
which
had
seemed
to
Sir
Griffin
to
be
as
the
Greek
Kalends
.
<EOS>
He
expressed
an
opinion
that
he
was
swindled
,
and
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
unable
to
restrain
herself
,
had
turned
upon
him
full
of
wrath
.
<EOS>
He
was
caught
by
Lizzie
as
he
was
descending
the
stairs
,
and
in
the
dining
-
room
he
poured
out
the
tale
of
his
wrongs
.
<EOS>
"
That
woman
does
n't
know
what
fair
dealing
means
,
"
said
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
a
little
hard
,
Sir
Griffin
,
is
n't
it
?
"
said
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
a
bit
.
<EOS>
A
trumpery
six
hundred
pounds
!
<EOS>
And
she
has
n't
a
shilling
of
fortune
,
and
never
will
have
,
beyond
that
!
<EOS>
No
fellow
ever
was
more
generous
or
more
foolish
than
I
have
been
.
"
<EOS>
Lizzie
,
as
she
heard
this
,
could
not
refrain
from
thinking
of
the
poor
departed
Sir
Florian
.
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
look
for
fortune
,
or
say
a
word
about
money
,
as
almost
every
man
does
,
 
but
just
took
her
as
she
was
.
<EOS>
And
now
she
tells
me
that
I
ca
n't
have
just
the
bit
of
money
that
I
wanted
for
our
tour
.
<EOS>
It
would
serve
them
both
right
<EOS>
if
I
were
to
give
it
up
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
do
n't
you
?
"
said
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
He
looked
quickly
,
sharply
,
and
closely
into
her
face
as
she
asked
the
question
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
,
if
I
thought
as
you
do
.
"
  
"
And
lay
myself
in
for
all
manner
of
damages
,
"
said
Sir
Griffin
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
would
n't
be
anything
of
that
kind
,
I
'm
sure
.
<EOS>
You
see
,
the
truth
is
,
you
and
Miss
Roanoke
are
always
having
 
having
little
tiffs
together
.
<EOS>
I
sometimes
think
you
do
n't
really
care
a
bit
for
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
the
old
woman
I
'm
complaining
of
,
"
said
Sir
Griffin
,
"
and
I
'm
not
going
to
marry
her
.
<EOS>
I
shall
have
seen
the
last
of
her
when
I
get
out
of
the
church
,
Lady
Eustace
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
think
she
wishes
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Who
do
you
mean
?
"
asked
Sir
Griffin
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
;
 
Lucinda
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
she
does
.
<EOS>
Where
'd
she
be
now
if
it
was
n't
to
go
on
?
<EOS>
I
do
n't
believe
they
've
money
enough
between
them
to
pay
the
rent
of
the
house
they
're
living
in
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
,
I
do
n't
want
to
make
difficulties
,
Sir
Griffin
,
and
no
doubt
the
affair
has
gone
very
far
now
.
<EOS>
But
I
really
think
Lucinda
would
consent
to
break
it
off
if
you
wish
it
.
<EOS>
I
have
never
thought
that
you
were
really
in
love
with
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
again
looked
at
her
very
sharply
and
very
closely
.
"
<EOS>
Has
she
sent
you
to
say
all
this
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Has
who
sent
me
?
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
did
n't
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
But
Lucinda
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
paused
for
a
moment
before
she
replied
;
 
but
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
be
absolutely
honest
in
the
matter
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
;
 
she
did
n't
send
me
.
<EOS>
But
from
what
I
see
and
hear
,
I
am
quite
sure
she
does
not
wish
to
go
on
with
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
she
shall
go
on
with
it
,
"
said
Sir
Griffin
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
not
going
to
be
made
a
fool
of
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
She
shall
go
on
with
it
;
and
the
first
thing
I
mean
to
tell
her
as
my
wife
is
,
that
she
shall
never
see
that
woman
again
.
<EOS>
If
she
thinks
she
's
going
to
be
master
,
she
's
very
much
mistaken
.
"
<EOS>
Sir
Griffin
,
as
he
said
this
,
showed
his
teeth
,
and
declared
his
purpose
to
be
masterful
by
his
features
as
well
as
by
his
words
;
 
but
Lady
Eustace
was
,
nevertheless
,
of
opinion
that
when
the
two
came
to
an
absolute
struggle
for
mastery
,
the
lady
would
get
the
better
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
Lizzie
never
told
Miss
Roanoke
of
her
want
of
success
,
or
even
of
the
effort
she
had
made
;
nor
did
the
unhappy
young
woman
come
to
her
for
any
reply
.
<EOS>
The
preparations
went
on
,
and
it
was
quite
understood
that
on
this
peculiar
occasion
Mrs.
Carbuncle
intended
to
treat
her
friends
with
profuse
hospitality
.
<EOS>
She
proposed
to
give
a
breakfast
;
and
as
the
house
in
Hertford
Street
was
very
small
,
rooms
had
been
taken
at
an
hotel
in
Albemarle
Street
.
<EOS>
Thither
,
as
the
day
of
the
marriage
drew
near
,
all
the
presents
were
taken
,
 
so
that
they
might
be
viewed
by
the
guests
,
with
the
names
of
the
donors
attached
to
them
.
<EOS>
As
some
of
the
money
given
had
been
very
much
wanted
indeed
,
so
that
the
actual
cheques
could
not
be
conveniently
spared
just
at
the
moment
to
pay
for
the
presents
which
ought
to
have
been
bought
,
 
a
few
very
pretty
things
were
hired
,
as
to
which
,
when
the
donors
should
see
their
names
attached
to
them
,
they
should
surely
think
that
the
money
given
had
been
laid
out
to
great
advantage
.
   
<EOS>
The
Eye
of
the
Public
 
<EOS>
It
took
Lord
Fawn
a
long
time
to
write
his
letter
,
but
at
last
he
wrote
it
.
<EOS>
The
delay
must
not
be
taken
as
throwing
any
slur
on
his
character
as
a
correspondent
or
a
man
of
business
,
for
many
irritating
causes
sprang
up
sufficient
to
justify
him
in
pleading
that
it
arose
from
circumstances
beyond
his
own
control
.
<EOS>
It
is
,
moreover
,
felt
by
us
all
that
the
time
which
may
fairly
be
taken
in
the
performance
of
any
task
depends
,
not
on
the
amount
of
work
,
but
on
the
performance
of
it
when
done
.
<EOS>
A
man
is
not
expected
to
write
a
cheque
for
a
couple
of
thousand
pounds
as
readily
as
he
would
one
for
five
,
 
unless
he
be
a
man
to
whom
a
couple
of
thousand
pounds
is
a
mere
nothing
.
<EOS>
To
Lord
Fawn
the
writing
of
this
letter
was
everything
.
<EOS>
He
had
told
Lizzie
,
with
much
exactness
,
what
he
would
put
into
it
.
<EOS>
He
would
again
offer
his
hand
,
 
acknowledging
himself
bound
to
do
so
by
his
former
offer
,
 
but
would
give
reasons
why
she
should
not
accept
it
.
<EOS>
If
anything
should
occur
in
the
meantime
which
would
,
in
his
opinion
,
justify
him
in
again
repudiating
her
,
he
would
of
course
take
advantage
of
such
circumstance
.
<EOS>
If
asked
himself
what
was
his
prevailing
motive
in
all
that
he
did
or
intended
to
do
,
he
would
have
declared
that
it
was
above
all
things
necessary
that
he
should
"
put
himself
right
in
the
eye
of
the
British
public
.
"
  
<EOS>
But
he
was
not
able
to
do
this
without
interference
from
the
judgment
of
others
.
<EOS>
Both
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Hittaway
interfered
;
and
he
could
not
prevent
himself
from
listening
to
them
and
believing
them
,
though
he
would
contradict
all
they
said
,
and
snub
all
their
theories
.
<EOS>
Frank
Greystock
also
continued
to
interfere
,
and
Lady
Glencora
Palliser
.
<EOS>
Even
John
Eustace
had
been
worked
upon
to
write
to
Lord
Fawn
,
stating
his
opinion
,
as
trustee
for
his
late
brother
's
property
,
that
the
Eustace
family
did
not
think
that
there
was
ground
of
complaint
against
Lady
Eustace
in
reference
to
the
diamonds
which
had
been
stolen
.
<EOS>
This
was
a
terrible
blow
to
Lord
Fawn
,
and
had
come
,
no
doubt
,
from
a
general
agreement
among
the
Eustace
faction
,
 
including
the
bishop
,
John
Eustace
,
and
even
Mr.
Camperdown
,
 
that
it
would
be
a
good
thing
to
get
the
widow
married
and
placed
under
some
decent
control
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
absolutely
had
the
effrontery
to
ask
him
whether
the
marriage
was
not
going
to
take
place
,
and
when
a
day
would
be
fixed
.
<EOS>
He
gathered
up
his
courage
to
give
her
ladyship
a
rebuke
.
<EOS>
"
My
private
affairs
do
seem
to
be
uncommonly
interesting
,
"
he
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
yes
,
Lord
Fawn
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
,
whom
nothing
could
abash
;
 
"
most
interesting
.
<EOS>
You
see
,
dear
Lady
Eustace
is
so
very
popular
,
that
we
all
want
to
know
what
is
to
be
her
fate
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
regret
to
say
that
I
can
not
answer
your
ladyship
's
question
with
any
precision
,
"
said
Lord
Fawn
.
  
<EOS>
But
the
Hittaway
persecution
was
by
far
the
worst
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
seen
her
,
Frederic
?
"
said
his
sister
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
 
I
have
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
made
her
no
promise
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Clara
,
this
is
a
matter
in
which
I
must
use
my
own
judgment
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
But
the
family
,
Frederic
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
that
any
member
of
our
family
has
a
just
right
to
complain
of
my
conduct
since
I
have
had
the
honour
of
being
its
head
.
<EOS>
I
have
endeavoured
so
to
live
that
my
actions
should
encounter
no
private
or
public
censure
.
<EOS>
If
I
fail
to
meet
with
your
approbation
,
I
shall
grieve
;
but
I
can
not
on
that
account
act
otherwise
than
in
accordance
with
my
own
judgment
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Hittaway
knew
her
brother
well
,
and
was
not
afraid
of
him
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
That
's
all
very
well
;
and
I
am
sure
you
know
,
Frederic
,
how
proud
we
all
are
of
you
.
<EOS>
But
this
woman
is
a
nasty
,
low
,
scheming
,
ill
-
conducted
,
dishonest
little
wretch
;
and
if
you
make
her
your
wife
you
'll
be
miserable
all
your
life
.
<EOS>
Nothing
would
make
me
and
Orlando
so
unhappy
as
to
quarrel
with
you
.
<EOS>
But
we
know
that
it
is
so
,
and
to
the
last
minute
I
shall
say
so
.
<EOS>
Why
do
n't
you
ask
her
to
her
face
about
that
man
down
in
Scotland
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Clara
,
perhaps
I
know
what
to
ask
her
and
what
not
to
ask
her
better
than
you
can
tell
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
And
his
brother
-
in
-
law
was
quite
as
bad
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Fawn
,
"
he
said
,
"
in
this
matter
of
Lady
Eustace
,
do
n't
you
think
you
ought
to
put
your
conduct
into
the
hands
of
some
friend
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
by
that
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
is
an
affair
in
which
a
man
would
have
so
much
comfort
in
being
able
to
say
that
he
was
guided
by
advice
.
<EOS>
Of
course
,
her
people
want
you
to
marry
her
.
<EOS>
Now
,
if
you
could
just
tell
them
that
the
whole
thing
was
in
the
hands
of
,
 
say
me
,
 
or
any
other
friend
,
you
would
be
relieved
,
you
know
,
of
so
much
responsibility
.
<EOS>
They
might
hammer
away
at
me
ever
so
long
,
and
I
should
n't
care
twopence
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
there
is
to
be
any
hammering
,
it
can
not
be
borne
vicariously
,
"
said
Lord
Fawn
,
 
<EOS>
and
as
he
said
it
,
he
was
quite
pleased
by
his
own
sharpness
and
wit
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
,
indeed
,
put
himself
beyond
protection
by
vicarious
endurance
of
hammering
when
he
promised
to
write
to
Lady
Eustace
,
explaining
his
own
conduct
and
giving
reasons
.
<EOS>
Had
anything
turned
up
in
Scotland
Yard
which
would
have
justified
him
in
saying
,
 
or
even
in
thinking
,
 
that
Lizzie
had
stolen
her
own
diamonds
,
he
would
have
sent
word
to
her
that
he
must
abstain
from
any
communication
till
that
matter
had
been
cleared
up
;
but
since
the
appearance
of
that
mysterious
paragraph
in
the
newspapers
,
nothing
had
been
heard
of
the
robbery
,
and
public
opinion
certainly
seemed
to
be
in
favour
of
Lizzie
's
innocence
.
<EOS>
He
did
think
that
the
Eustace
faction
was
betraying
him
,
as
he
could
not
but
remember
how
eager
Mr.
Camperdown
had
been
in
asserting
that
the
widow
was
keeping
an
enormous
amount
of
property
and
claiming
it
as
her
own
,
whereas
,
in
truth
,
she
had
not
the
slightest
title
to
it
.
<EOS>
It
was
,
in
a
great
measure
,
in
consequence
of
the
assertions
of
the
Eustace
faction
,
almost
in
obedience
to
their
advice
,
that
he
had
resolved
to
break
off
the
match
;
and
now
they
turned
upon
him
,
and
John
Eustace
absolutely
went
out
of
his
way
to
write
him
a
letter
which
was
clearly
meant
to
imply
that
he
,
Lord
Fawn
,
was
bound
to
marry
the
woman
to
whom
he
had
once
engaged
himself
!
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
felt
that
he
was
ill
-
used
,
and
that
a
man
might
have
to
undergo
a
great
deal
of
bad
treatment
who
should
strive
to
put
himself
right
in
the
eye
of
the
public
.
  
<EOS>
At
last
he
wrote
his
letter
,
 
on
a
Wednesday
,
which
with
him
had
something
of
the
comfort
of
a
half
-
holiday
,
as
on
that
day
he
was
not
required
to
attend
Parliament
.

MY
DEAR
LADY
EUSTACE
,
  
<EOS>
In
accordance
with
the
promise
which
I
made
to
you
when
I
did
myself
the
honour
of
waiting
upon
you
in
Hertford
Street
,
I
take
up
my
pen
with
the
view
of
communicating
to
you
the
result
of
my
deliberations
respecting
the
engagement
of
marriage
which
,
no
doubt
,
did
exist
between
us
last
summer
.
  
<EOS>
Since
that
time
I
have
no
doubt
taken
upon
myself
to
say
that
that
engagement
was
over
;
and
I
am
free
to
admit
that
I
did
so
without
any
assent
or
agreement
on
your
part
to
that
effect
.
<EOS>
Such
conduct
no
doubt
requires
a
valid
and
strong
defence
.
<EOS>
My
defence
is
as
follows
:
    
<EOS>
I
learned
that
you
were
in
possession
of
a
large
amount
of
property
,
vested
in
diamonds
,
which
was
claimed
by
the
executors
under
your
late
husband
's
will
as
belonging
to
his
estate
;
and
as
to
which
they
declared
,
in
the
most
positive
manner
,
that
you
had
no
right
or
title
to
it
<EOS>
whatever
.
<EOS>
I
consulted
friends
and
I
consulted
lawyers
,
and
I
was
led
to
the
conviction
that
this
property
certainly
did
not
belong
to
you
.
<EOS>
Had
I
married
you
in
these
circumstances
,
I
could
not
but
have
become
a
participator
in
the
lawsuit
which
I
was
assured
would
be
commenced
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
be
a
participator
with
you
,
because
I
believed
you
to
be
in
the
wrong
.
<EOS>
And
I
certainly
could
not
participate
with
those
who
would
in
such
case
be
attacking
my
own
wife
.
  
<EOS>
In
this
condition
of
things
I
requested
you
,
 
as
you
must
,
I
think
,
yourself
own
,
with
all
deference
and
good
feeling
,
 
to
give
up
the
actual
possession
of
the
property
,
and
to
place
the
diamonds
in
neutral
hands
,
 
<EOS>
[
Lord
Fawn
was
often
called
upon
to
be
neutral
in
reference
to
the
condition
of
outlying
Indian
principalities
]
 
<EOS>
till
the
law
should
have
decided
as
to
their
ownership
.
<EOS>
As
regards
myself
,
I
neither
coveted
nor
rejected
the
possession
of
that
wealth
for
my
future
wife
.
<EOS>
I
desired
simply
to
be
free
from
an
embarrassment
which
would
have
overwhelmed
me
.
<EOS>
You
declined
my
request
,
 
not
only
positively
,
but
perhaps
I
may
add
peremptorily
;
and
then
I
was
bound
to
adhere
to
the
decision
I
had
communicated
to
you
.
  
<EOS>
Since
that
time
the
property
has
been
stolen
and
,
as
I
believe
,
dissipated
.
<EOS>
The
lawsuit
against
you
has
been
withdrawn
;
and
the
bone
of
contention
,
so
to
say
,
is
no
longer
existing
.
<EOS>
I
am
no
longer
justified
in
declining
to
keep
my
engagement
because
of
the
prejudice
to
which
I
should
have
been
subjected
by
your
possession
of
the
diamonds
;
 
and
,
therefore
,
as
far
as
that
goes
,
I
withdraw
my
withdrawal
.
<EOS>
[
This
Lord
Fawn
thought
was
rather
a
happy
phrase
,
and
he
read
it
aloud
to
himself
more
than
once
.
]
  
<EOS>
But
now
there
arises
the
question
whether
,
in
both
our
interests
,
this
marriage
should
go
on
,
or
whether
it
may
not
be
more
conducive
to
your
happiness
and
to
mine
that
it
should
be
annulled
for
causes
altogether
irrespective
of
the
diamonds
.
<EOS>
In
a
matter
so
serious
as
marriage
,
the
happiness
of
the
two
parties
is
that
which
requires
graver
thought
than
any
other
consideration
.
  
<EOS>
There
has
no
doubt
sprung
up
between
us
a
feeling
of
mutual
distrust
,
which
has
led
to
recrimination
,
and
which
is
hardly
compatible
with
that
perfect
confidence
which
should
exist
between
a
man
and
his
wife
.
<EOS>
This
first
arose
,
no
doubt
,
from
the
different
views
which
we
took
as
to
that
property
of
which
I
have
spoken
,
 
and
as
to
which
your
judgment
may
possibly
have
been
better
than
mine
.
<EOS>
On
that
head
I
will
add
nothing
to
what
I
have
already
said
;
but
the
feeling
has
arisen
;
and
I
fear
it
can
not
be
so
perfectly
allayed
as
to
admit
of
that
reciprocal
trust
without
which
we
could
not
live
happily
together
.
<EOS>
I
confess
that
for
my
own
part
I
do
not
now
desire
a
union
which
was
once
the
great
object
of
my
ambition
,
 
and
that
I
could
not
go
to
the
altar
with
you
without
fear
and
trembling
.
<EOS>
As
to
your
own
feelings
,
you
best
know
what
they
are
.
<EOS>
I
bring
no
charge
against
you
;
 
but
if
you
have
ceased
to
love
me
,
I
think
you
should
cease
to
wish
to
be
my
wife
,
and
that
you
should
not
insist
upon
a
marriage
simply
because
by
doing
so
you
would
triumph
over
a
former
objection
.
  
<EOS>
Before
he
finished
this
paragraph
,
he
thought
much
of
Andy
Gowran
and
of
the
scene
among
the
rocks
of
which
he
had
heard
.
<EOS>
But
he
could
not
speak
of
it
.
<EOS>
He
had
found
himself
unable
to
examine
the
witness
who
had
been
brought
to
him
,
and
had
honestly
told
himself
that
he
could
not
take
that
charge
as
proved
.
<EOS>
Andy
Gowran
might
have
lied
.
<EOS>
In
his
heart
he
believed
that
Andy
Gowran
had
lied
.
<EOS>
The
matter
was
distasteful
to
him
,
and
he
would
not
touch
it
.
<EOS>
And
yet
he
knew
that
the
woman
did
not
love
him
,
and
he
longed
to
tell
her
so
.
  
<EOS>
As
to
what
we
might
each
gain
or
each
lose
in
a
worldly
point
of
view
,
either
by
marrying
or
not
marrying
,
I
will
not
say
a
word
.
<EOS>
You
have
rank
and
wealth
,
and
therefore
I
can
comfort
myself
by
thinking
that
if
I
dissuade
you
from
this
marriage
I
shall
rob
you
of
neither
.
<EOS>
I
acknowledge
that
I
wish
to
dissuade
you
,
as
I
believe
that
we
should
not
make
each
other
happy
.
<EOS>
As
,
however
,
I
do
consider
that
I
am
bound
to
keep
my
engagement
to
you
if
you
demand
that
I
shall
do
so
<EOS>
,
I
leave
the
matter
in
your
hands
for
decision
.
  
<EOS>
I
am
,
and
shall
remain
,
  
<EOS>
Your
sincere
friend
,
  
FAWN
.
  
<EOS>
He
read
the
letter
and
copied
it
,
and
gave
himself
great
credit
for
the
composition
.
<EOS>
He
thought
that
it
was
impossible
that
any
woman
after
reading
it
should
express
a
wish
to
become
the
wife
of
the
man
who
wrote
it
;
and
yet
,
 
so
he
believed
,
 
no
man
or
woman
could
find
fault
with
him
for
writing
it
.
<EOS>
There
certainly
was
one
view
of
the
case
which
was
very
distressing
.
<EOS>
How
would
it
be
with
him
if
,
after
all
,
she
should
say
that
she
would
marry
him
?
<EOS>
After
having
given
her
her
choice
,
 
having
put
it
all
in
writing
,
 
he
could
not
again
go
back
from
it
.
<EOS>
He
would
be
in
her
power
,
and
of
what
use
would
his
life
be
to
him
?
<EOS>
Would
Parliament
,
or
the
India
Office
,
or
the
eye
of
the
public
be
able
to
comfort
him
then
in
the
midst
of
his
many
miseries
?
<EOS>
What
could
he
do
with
a
wife
whom
he
married
with
a
declaration
that
he
disliked
her
?
<EOS>
With
such
feelings
as
were
his
,
how
could
he
stand
before
a
clergyman
and
take
an
oath
that
he
would
love
her
and
cherish
her
?
<EOS>
Would
she
not
ever
be
as
an
adder
to
him
,
 
as
an
adder
whom
it
would
be
impossible
that
he
should
admit
into
his
bosom
?
<EOS>
Could
he
live
in
the
same
house
with
her
;
and
if
so
,
could
he
ask
his
mother
and
sisters
to
visit
her
?
<EOS>
He
remembered
well
what
Mrs.
Hittaway
had
called
her
;
 
a
nasty
,
low
,
scheming
,
ill
-
conducted
,
dishonest
little
wretch
!
<EOS>
And
he
believed
that
she
was
so
!
<EOS>
Yet
he
was
once
again
offering
to
marry
her
,
should
she
choose
to
accept
him
.
  
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
the
letter
was
sent
.
<EOS>
There
was
,
in
truth
,
no
alternative
.
<EOS>
He
had
promised
that
he
would
write
such
a
letter
,
and
all
that
had
remained
to
him
was
the
power
of
cramming
into
it
every
available
argument
against
the
marriage
.
<EOS>
This
he
had
done
,
and
,
as
he
thought
,
had
done
well
.
<EOS>
It
was
impossible
that
she
should
desire
to
marry
him
after
reading
such
a
letter
as
that
!
  
<EOS>
Lizzie
received
it
in
her
bedroom
,
where
she
breakfasted
,
and
told
of
its
arrival
to
her
friend
Mrs.
Carbuncle
as
soon
as
they
met
each
other
.
<EOS>
"
My
lord
has
come
down
from
his
high
horse
at
last
,
"
she
said
,
with
the
letter
in
her
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
,
 
Lord
Fawn
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Yes
;
Lord
Fawn
.
<EOS>
What
other
lord
?
<EOS>
There
is
no
other
lord
for
me
.
<EOS>
He
is
my
lord
,
my
peer
of
Parliament
,
my
Cabinet
minister
,
my
right
honourable
,
my
member
of
the
Government
,
 
my
young
man
,
too
,
as
the
maid
-
servants
call
them
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
does
he
say
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Say
;
 
what
should
he
say
?
 
<EOS>
just
that
he
has
behaved
very
badly
,
and
that
he
hopes
I
shall
forgive
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
quite
that
;
does
he
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
what
it
all
means
.
<EOS>
Of
course
,
there
is
ever
so
much
of
it
,
 
pages
of
it
.
<EOS>
It
would
n't
be
Lord
Fawn
if
he
did
n't
spin
it
all
out
like
an
Act
of
Parliament
,
with
"
whereas
"
and
"
wherein
,
"
and
"
whereof
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
full
of
all
that
;
but
the
meaning
of
it
is
that
he
's
at
my
feet
again
,
and
that
I
may
pick
him
up
if
I
choose
to
take
him
.
<EOS>
I
'd
show
you
the
letter
,
only
perhaps
it
would
n't
be
fair
to
the
poor
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
excuse
does
he
make
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
 
as
to
that
he
's
rational
enough
.
<EOS>
He
calls
the
necklace
the
 
bone
of
contention
.
<EOS>
That
's
rather
good
for
Lord
Fawn
;
is
n't
it
?
<EOS>
The
bone
of
contention
,
he
says
,
has
been
removed
;
and
,
therefore
,
there
is
no
reason
why
we
should
n't
marry
if
we
like
it
.
<EOS>
He
shall
hear
enough
about
the
bone
of
contention
if
we
do
"
marry
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
what
shall
you
do
now
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
yes
;
that
's
easily
asked
;
is
it
not
?
<EOS>
The
man
's
a
good
sort
of
man
in
his
way
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
He
does
n't
drink
or
gamble
;
and
I
do
n't
think
there
is
a
bit
of
the
King
David
about
him
,
 
that
I
do
n't
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Virtue
personified
,
I
should
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
he
is
n't
extravagant
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
why
not
have
him
and
have
done
with
it
?
"
asked
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
such
a
lumpy
man
,
"
said
Lizzie
;
 
"
such
an
ass
;
such
a
load
of
Government
waste
-
paper
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Come
,
my
dear
;
 
you
've
had
troubles
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
,
indeed
,
"
said
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
there
's
no
quite
knowing
yet
how
far
they
're
over
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
by
that
,
Mrs.
Carbuncle
?
"
  
"
Nothing
very
much
;
 
but
still
,
you
see
,
they
may
come
again
.
<EOS>
As
to
Lord
George
,
we
all
know
that
he
has
not
got
a
penny
-
piece
in
the
world
that
he
can
call
his
own
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
he
had
as
many
pennies
as
Judas
,
Lord
George
would
be
nothing
to
me
,
"
said
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
your
cousin
really
does
n't
seem
to
mean
anything
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
very
well
what
my
cousin
means
.
<EOS>
He
and
I
understand
each
other
thoroughly
;
but
cousins
can
love
one
another
very
well
without
marrying
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
you
know
your
own
business
,
but
if
I
were
you
I
would
take
Lord
Fawn
.
<EOS>
I
speak
in
true
kindness
,
 
as
one
woman
to
another
.
<EOS>
After
all
,
what
does
love
signify
?
<EOS>
How
much
real
love
do
we
ever
see
among
married
people
?
<EOS>
Does
Lady
Glencora
Palliser
really
love
her
husband
,
who
thinks
of
nothing
in
the
world
but
putting
taxes
on
and
off
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
love
your
husband
,
Mrs.
Carbuncle
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
 
but
that
is
a
different
kind
of
thing
.
<EOS>
Circumstances
have
caused
me
to
live
apart
from
him
.
<EOS>
The
man
is
a
good
man
,
and
there
is
no
reason
why
you
should
not
respect
him
,
and
treat
him
well
.
<EOS>
He
will
give
you
a
fixed
position
,
 
which
really
you
want
badly
,
Lady
Eustace
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Tooriloo
,
tooriloo
,
tooriloo
,
looriloo
,
"
said
Lizzie
,
in
contemptuous
disdain
of
her
friend
's
caution
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
then
all
this
trouble
about
the
diamonds
and
the
robberies
will
be
over
,
"
continued
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
looked
at
her
very
intently
.
<EOS>
What
should
make
Mrs.
Carbuncle
suppose
that
there
need
be
,
or
,
indeed
,
could
be
,
any
further
trouble
about
the
diamonds
?
  
<EOS>
"
So
;
 
that
's
your
advice
,
"
said
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
half
inclined
to
take
it
,
and
perhaps
I
shall
.
<EOS>
However
,
I
have
brought
him
round
,
and
that
's
something
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
And
either
one
way
or
the
other
,
I
shall
let
him
know
that
I
like
my
triumph
.
<EOS>
I
was
determined
to
have
it
,
and
I
've
got
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Then
she
read
the
letter
again
very
seriously
.
<EOS>
Could
she
possibly
marry
a
man
who
in
so
many
words
told
her
that
he
did
n't
want
her
?
<EOS>
Well
;
 
she
thought
she
could
.
<EOS>
Was
not
everybody
treating
everybody
else
much
in
the
same
way
?
<EOS>
Had
she
not
loved
her
Corsair
truly
,
 
and
how
had
he
treated
her
?
<EOS>
Had
she
not
been
true
,
disinterested
,
and
most
affectionate
to
Frank
Greystock
;
and
what
had
she
got
from
him
?
<EOS>
To
manage
her
business
wisely
,
and
put
herself
upon
firm
ground
;
 
that
was
her
duty
at
present
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
was
right
there
.
<EOS>
The
very
name
of
Lady
Fawn
would
be
a
rock
to
her
,
 
and
she
wanted
a
rock
.
<EOS>
She
thought
upon
the
whole
that
she
could
marry
him
;
 
unless
Patience
Crabstick
and
the
police
should
again
interfere
with
her
prosperity
.
   
<EOS>
The
Major
 
Lady
Eustace
did
not
intend
to
take
as
much
time
in
answering
Lord
Fawn
's
letter
as
he
had
taken
in
writing
it
;
but
even
she
found
that
the
subject
was
one
which
demanded
a
good
deal
of
thought
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
had
very
freely
recommended
her
to
take
the
man
,
supporting
her
advice
by
arguments
which
Lizzie
felt
to
be
valid
;
but
then
Mrs.
Carbuncle
did
not
know
all
the
circumstances
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
had
not
actually
seen
his
lordship
's
letter
;
and
though
the
great
part
of
the
letter
,
the
formal
repetition
,
namely
,
of
the
writer
's
offer
of
marriage
,
had
been
truly
told
to
her
,
still
,
as
the
reader
will
have
perceived
,
she
had
been
kept
in
the
dark
as
to
some
of
the
details
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
did
sit
at
her
desk
with
the
object
of
putting
a
few
words
together
in
order
that
she
might
see
how
they
looked
,
and
she
found
that
there
was
a
difficulty
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
Lord
Fawn
.
<EOS>
As
we
have
been
engaged
to
marry
each
other
,
and
as
all
our
friends
have
been
told
,
I
think
that
the
thing
had
better
go
on
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
That
,
after
various
attempts
,
was
,
she
thought
,
the
best
letter
that
she
could
send
,
 
if
she
should
make
up
her
mind
to
be
Lady
Fawn
.
<EOS>
But
,
on
the
morning
of
the
30th
of
March
she
had
not
sent
her
letter
.
<EOS>
She
had
told
herself
that
she
would
take
two
days
to
think
of
her
reply
,
 
and
,
on
the
Friday
morning
the
few
words
she
had
prepared
were
still
lying
in
her
desk
.
  
<EOS>
What
was
she
to
get
by
marrying
a
man
she
absolutely
disliked
?
<EOS>
That
he
also
absolutely
disliked
her
was
not
a
matter
much
in
her
thoughts
.
<EOS>
The
man
would
not
ill
-
treat
her
because
he
disliked
her
;
or
,
it
might
perhaps
be
juster
to
say
,
that
the
ill
-
treatment
which
she
might
fairly
anticipate
would
not
be
of
a
nature
which
would
much
affect
her
comfort
grievously
.
<EOS>
He
would
not
beat
her
,
nor
rob
her
,
nor
lock
her
up
,
nor
starve
her
.
<EOS>
He
would
either
neglect
her
,
or
preach
sermons
to
her
.
<EOS>
For
the
first
she
could
console
herself
by
the
attention
of
others
;
and
should
he
preach
,
<EOS>
perhaps
she
could
preach
too
,
 
as
sharply
if
not
as
lengthily
as
his
lordship
.
<EOS>
At
any
rate
,
she
was
not
afraid
of
him
.
<EOS>
But
what
would
she
gain
?
<EOS>
It
is
very
well
to
have
a
rock
,
as
Mrs.
Carbuncle
had
said
,
but
a
rock
is
not
everything
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
know
whether
she
cared
much
for
living
upon
a
rock
.
<EOS>
Even
stability
may
be
purchased
at
too
high
a
price
.
<EOS>
There
was
not
a
grain
of
poetry
in
the
whole
composition
of
Lord
Fawn
,
and
poetry
was
what
her
very
soul
craved
;
 
poetry
,
together
with
houses
,
champagne
,
jewels
,
and
admiration
.
<EOS>
Her
income
was
still
her
own
,
and
she
did
not
quite
see
that
the
rock
was
so
absolutely
necessary
to
her
.
<EOS>
Then
she
wrote
another
note
to
Lord
Fawn
,
a
specimen
of
a
note
,
so
that
she
might
have
the
opportunity
of
comparing
the
two
.
<EOS>
This
note
took
her
much
longer
than
the
one
first
written
.
  
<EOS>
MY
LORD
,
    
I
do
not
know
how
to
acknowledge
with
sufficient
humility
the
condescension
and
great
kindness
of
your
lordship
's
letter
.
<EOS>
But
perhaps
its
manly
generosity
is
more
conspicuous
than
either
.
<EOS>
The
truth
is
,
my
lord
,
you
want
to
escape
from
your
engagement
,
but
are
too
much
afraid
of
the
consequences
to
dare
to
do
so
by
any
act
of
your
own
;
 
therefore
you
throw
it
upon
me
.
<EOS>
You
are
quite
successful
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
think
you
ever
read
poetry
,
but
perhaps
you
may
understand
the
two
following
lines
:
    
<EOS>
"
I
am
constrained
to
say
,
your
lordship
's
scullion
Should
sooner
be
my
husband
than
yourself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
see
through
you
,
and
despise
you
thoroughly
.
  
<EOS>
E.
EUSTACE
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
comparing
the
two
answers
together
,
very
much
in
doubt
as
to
which
should
be
sent
,
when
there
came
a
message
to
her
by
a
man
whom
she
knew
to
be
a
policeman
,
though
he
did
not
announce
himself
as
such
,
and
was
dressed
in
plain
clothes
.
<EOS>
Major
Mackintosh
sent
his
compliments
to
her
,
and
would
wait
upon
her
that
afternoon
at
three
o'clock
,
if
she
would
have
the
kindness
to
receive
him
.
<EOS>
At
the
first
moment
of
seeing
the
man
she
felt
that
after
all
the
rock
was
what
she
wanted
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
was
right
.
<EOS>
She
had
had
troubles
and
might
have
more
,
and
the
rock
was
the
thing
.
<EOS>
But
then
the
more
certainly
did
she
become
convinced
of
this
by
the
presence
of
the
major
's
messenger
,
the
more
clearly
did
she
see
the
difficulty
of
attaining
the
security
which
the
rock
offered
.
<EOS>
If
this
public
exposure
should
fall
upon
her
,
Lord
Fawn
's
renewed
offer
,
as
she
knew
well
,
would
stand
for
nothing
.
<EOS>
If
once
it
were
known
that
she
had
kept
the
necklace
,
 
her
own
necklace
,
 
under
her
pillow
at
Carlisle
,
he
would
want
no
further
justification
in
repudiating
her
,
were
it
for
the
tenth
time
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
very
uncivil
to
the
messenger
,
and
the
more
so
because
she
found
that
the
man
bore
her
rudeness
without
turning
upon
her
and
rending
her
.
<EOS>
When
she
declared
that
the
police
had
behaved
very
badly
,
and
that
Major
Mackintosh
was
inexcusable
in
troubling
her
again
,
and
that
she
had
ceased
to
care
twopence
about
the
necklace
,
 
the
man
made
no
remonstrance
to
her
petulance
.
<EOS>
He
owned
that
the
trouble
was
very
great
,
and
the
police
very
inefficient
.
<EOS>
He
almost
owned
that
the
major
was
inexcusable
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
care
what
he
owned
so
that
he
achieved
his
object
.
<EOS>
But
when
Lizzie
said
that
she
could
not
see
Major
Mackintosh
at
three
,
and
objected
equally
to
two
,
four
,
or
five
;
then
the
courteous
messenger
from
Scotland
Yard
did
say
a
word
to
make
her
understand
that
there
must
be
a
meeting
,
 
and
he
hinted
also
that
the
major
was
doing
a
most
unusually
good
-
natured
thing
in
coming
to
Hertford
Street
.
<EOS>
Of
course
,
Lizzie
made
the
appointment
.
<EOS>
If
the
major
chose
to
come
,
she
would
be
at
home
at
three
.
  
<EOS>
As
soon
as
the
policeman
was
gone
,
she
sat
alone
,
with
a
manner
very
much
changed
from
that
which
she
had
worn
since
the
arrival
of
Lord
Fawn
's
letter
,
 
with
a
fresh
weight
of
care
upon
her
,
greater
perhaps
than
she
had
ever
hitherto
borne
.
<EOS>
She
had
had
bad
moments
,
 
when
,
for
instance
,
she
had
been
taken
before
the
magistrates
at
Carlisle
,
when
she
found
the
police
in
her
house
on
her
return
from
the
theatre
,
and
when
Lord
George
had
forced
her
secret
from
her
.
<EOS>
But
at
each
of
these
periods
hope
had
come
renewed
before
despair
had
crushed
her
.
<EOS>
Now
it
seemed
to
her
that
the
thing
was
done
and
that
the
game
was
over
.
<EOS>
This
chief
man
of
the
London
police
no
doubt
knew
the
whole
story
.
<EOS>
If
she
could
only
already
have
climbed
upon
some
rock
,
so
that
there
might
be
a
man
bound
to
defend
her
,
 
a
man
at
any
rate
bound
to
put
himself
forward
on
her
behalf
and
do
whatever
might
be
done
in
her
defence
,
 
she
might
have
endured
it
!
  
<EOS>
What
should
she
do
now
,
 
at
this
minute
?
<EOS>
She
looked
at
her
watch
and
found
that
it
was
already
past
one
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
as
she
knew
,
was
closeted
up
-
stairs
with
Lucinda
,
whose
wedding
was
fixed
for
the
following
Monday
.
<EOS>
It
was
now
Friday
.
<EOS>
Were
she
to
call
upon
Mrs.
Carbuncle
for
aid
,
no
aid
would
be
forthcoming
unless
she
were
to
tell
the
whole
truth
.
<EOS>
She
almost
thought
that
she
would
do
so
.
<EOS>
But
then
,
how
great
would
have
been
her
indiscretion
if
,
after
all
,
when
the
major
should
come
,
she
should
discover
that
he
did
not
know
the
truth
himself
!
<EOS>
That
Mrs.
Carbuncle
would
keep
her
secret
<EOS>
she
did
not
for
a
moment
think
.
<EOS>
She
longed
for
the
comfort
of
some
friend
's
counsel
,
but
she
found
at
last
that
she
could
not
purchase
it
by
telling
everything
to
a
woman
.
  
<EOS>
Might
it
not
be
possible
that
she
should
still
run
away
?
<EOS>
She
did
not
know
much
of
the
law
,
but
she
thought
that
they
could
not
punish
her
for
breaking
an
appointment
even
with
a
man
so
high
in
authority
as
Major
Mackintosh
.
<EOS>
She
could
leave
a
note
saying
that
pressing
business
called
her
out
.
<EOS>
But
whither
should
she
go
?
<EOS>
She
thought
of
taking
a
cab
to
the
House
of
Commons
,
finding
her
cousin
,
and
telling
him
everything
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
so
much
better
that
he
should
see
the
major
.
<EOS>
But
then
again
,
it
might
be
that
she
should
be
mistaken
as
to
the
amount
of
the
major
's
information
.
<EOS>
After
a
while
she
almost
determined
to
fly
off
at
once
to
Scotland
,
leaving
word
that
she
was
obliged
to
go
instantly
to
her
child
.
<EOS>
But
there
was
no
direct
train
to
Scotland
before
eight
or
nine
in
the
evening
,
and
during
the
intervening
hours
the
police
would
have
ample
time
to
find
her
.
<EOS>
What
,
indeed
,
could
she
do
with
herself
during
these
intervening
hours
?
<EOS>
Ah
,
if
she
had
but
a
rock
now
,
so
that
she
need
not
be
dependent
altogether
on
the
exercise
of
her
own
intellect
!
  
<EOS>
Gradually
the
minutes
passed
by
,
and
she
became
aware
that
she
must
face
the
major
.
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
What
had
she
done
?
<EOS>
She
had
stolen
nothing
.
<EOS>
She
had
taken
no
person
's
property
.
<EOS>
She
had
,
indeed
,
been
wickedly
robbed
,
and
the
police
had
done
nothing
to
get
back
for
her
her
property
,
as
they
were
bound
to
have
done
.
<EOS>
She
would
take
care
to
tell
the
major
what
she
thought
about
the
negligence
of
the
police
.
<EOS>
The
major
should
not
have
the
talk
all
to
himself
.
  
<EOS>
If
it
had
not
been
for
one
word
with
which
Lord
George
had
stunned
her
ears
,
she
could
still
have
borne
it
well
.
<EOS>
She
had
told
a
lie
;
 
perhaps
two
or
three
lies
.
<EOS>
She
knew
that
she
had
lied
.
<EOS>
But
then
people
lie
every
day
.
<EOS>
She
would
not
have
minded
it
much
if
she
were
simply
to
be
called
a
liar
.
<EOS>
But
he
had
told
her
that
she
would
be
accused
of
 
perjury
.
<EOS>
There
was
something
frightful
to
her
in
the
name
.
<EOS>
And
there
were
,
she
knew
not
what
,
dreadful
penalties
attached
to
it
.
<EOS>
Lord
George
had
told
her
that
she
might
be
put
in
prison
,
 
whether
he
had
said
for
years
or
for
months
she
had
forgotten
.
<EOS>
And
she
thought
she
had
heard
of
people
's
property
being
confiscated
to
the
Crown
when
they
had
been
made
out
to
be
guilty
of
certain
great
offences
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
how
she
wished
that
she
had
a
rock
!
  
<EOS>
When
three
o'clock
came
she
had
not
started
for
Scotland
or
elsewhere
,
and
at
last
she
received
the
major
.
<EOS>
Could
she
have
thoroughly
trusted
the
servant
,
she
would
have
denied
herself
at
the
last
moment
,
but
she
feared
that
she
might
be
betrayed
,
and
she
thought
that
her
position
would
be
rendered
even
worse
than
it
was
at
present
by
a
futile
attempt
.
<EOS>
She
was
sitting
alone
,
pale
,
haggard
,
trembling
,
when
Major
Mackintosh
was
shown
into
her
room
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
as
well
explained
at
once
that
,
at
this
moment
,
the
major
knew
,
or
thought
that
he
knew
,
every
circumstance
of
the
two
robberies
,
and
that
his
surmises
were
in
every
respect
right
.
<EOS>
Miss
Crabstick
and
Mr.
Cann
were
in
comfortable
quarters
,
and
were
prepared
to
tell
all
that
they
could
tell
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Smiler
was
in
durance
,
and
Mr.
Benjamin
was
at
Vienna
,
in
the
hands
of
the
Austrian
police
,
who
were
prepared
to
give
him
up
to
those
who
desired
his
society
in
England
,
on
the
completion
of
certain
legal
formalities
.
<EOS>
That
Mr.
Benjamin
and
Mr.
Smiler
would
be
prosecuted
,
the
latter
for
the
robbery
and
the
former
for
conspiracy
to
rob
,
and
for
receiving
stolen
goods
,
was
a
matter
of
course
.
<EOS>
But
what
was
to
be
done
with
Lady
Eustace
?
<EOS>
That
,
at
the
present
moment
,
was
the
prevailing
trouble
with
the
police
.
<EOS>
During
the
last
three
weeks
every
precaution
had
been
taken
to
keep
the
matter
secret
,
and
it
is
hardly
too
much
to
say
that
Lizzie
's
interests
were
handled
not
only
with
consideration
but
with
tenderness
.
  
<EOS>
"
Lady
Eustace
,
"
said
the
major
,
"
I
am
very
sorry
to
trouble
you
.
<EOS>
No
doubt
the
man
who
called
on
you
this
morning
explained
to
you
who
I
am
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
yes
,
I
know
who
you
are
,
 
quite
well
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Lizzie
made
a
great
effort
to
speak
without
betraying
her
consternation
;
but
she
was
nearly
prostrated
.
<EOS>
The
major
,
however
,
hardly
observed
her
,
and
was
by
no
means
at
ease
himself
in
his
effort
to
save
her
from
unnecessary
annoyance
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
tall
,
thin
,
gaunt
man
of
about
forty
,
with
large
,
good
-
natured
eyes
;
 
but
it
was
not
till
the
interview
was
half
over
that
Lizzie
took
courage
to
look
even
into
his
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
Just
so
;
I
am
come
,
you
know
,
about
the
robbery
which
took
place
here
,
 
and
the
other
robbery
at
Carlisle
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
so
troubled
about
these
horrid
robberies
!
<EOS>
Sometimes
I
think
they
'll
be
the
death
of
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
Lady
Eustace
,
we
have
found
out
the
whole
truth
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
daresay
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
why
 
you
have
been
so
long
 
finding
it
out
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
have
had
very
clever
people
to
deal
with
,
Lady
Eustace
;
 
and
I
fear
that
,
even
now
,
we
shall
never
get
back
the
property
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
care
about
the
property
,
sir
;
 
although
it
was
all
my
own
.
<EOS>
Nobody
has
lost
anything
but
myself
;
and
I
really
do
n't
see
why
the
thing
should
not
die
out
,
as
I
do
n't
care
about
it
.
<EOS>
Whoever
it
is
,
they
may
have
it
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
were
bound
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
it
all
,
if
we
could
;
and
I
think
that
we
have
,
 
at
last
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
,
as
you
say
,
we
ought
to
have
done
it
sooner
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
 
I
do
n't
care
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
have
two
persons
in
custody
,
Lady
Eustace
,
whom
we
shall
use
as
witnesses
,
and
I
am
afraid
we
shall
have
to
call
upon
you
also
,
 
as
a
witness
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
It
occurred
to
Lizzie
that
they
could
not
lock
her
up
in
prison
and
make
her
a
witness
too
,
but
she
said
nothing
.
<EOS>
Then
the
major
continued
his
speech
,
 
and
asked
her
the
question
which
was
,
in
fact
,
alone
material
.
<EOS>
"
Of
course
,
Lady
Eustace
,
you
are
not
bound
to
say
anything
to
me
unless
you
like
it
,
 
<EOS>
and
you
must
understand
that
I
by
no
means
wish
you
to
criminate
yourself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
what
that
means
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
yourself
have
done
anything
wrong
,
I
do
n't
want
to
ask
you
to
confess
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
had
all
my
diamonds
stolen
,
if
you
mean
that
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
it
was
wrong
to
have
diamonds
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
to
come
to
my
question
,
 
I
suppose
we
may
take
it
for
granted
that
the
diamonds
were
in
your
desk
when
the
thieves
made
their
entrance
into
this
house
,
and
broke
the
desk
open
,
and
stole
the
money
out
of
it
?
"
<EOS>
Lizzie
breathed
so
hardly
,
that
she
was
quite
unable
to
speak
.
<EOS>
The
man
's
voice
was
very
gentle
and
very
kind
,
 
but
then
how
could
she
admit
that
one
fact
?
<EOS>
All
depended
on
that
one
fact
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
woman
Crabstick
,
"
said
the
major
,
"
has
confessed
,
and
will
state
on
her
oath
that
she
saw
the
necklace
in
your
hands
in
Hertford
Street
,
and
that
she
saw
it
placed
in
the
desk
.
<EOS>
She
then
gave
information
of
this
to
Benjamin
,
 
as
she
had
before
given
information
as
to
your
journey
up
from
Scotland
,
 
and
she
was
introduced
to
the
two
men
whom
she
let
into
the
house
.
<EOS>
One
of
them
,
indeed
,
who
will
also
give
evidence
for
us
,
she
had
before
met
at
Carlisle
.
<EOS>
She
then
was
present
when
the
necklace
was
taken
out
of
the
desk
.
<EOS>
The
man
who
opened
the
desk
and
took
it
out
,
who
also
cut
the
door
at
Carlisle
,
will
give
evidence
to
the
same
effect
.
<EOS>
The
man
who
carried
the
necklace
out
of
the
house
,
and
who
broke
open
the
box
at
Carlisle
,
will
be
tried
,
 
as
will
also
Benjamin
,
who
disposed
of
the
diamonds
.
<EOS>
I
have
told
you
the
whole
story
,
as
it
has
been
told
to
me
by
the
woman
Crabstick
.
<EOS>
Of
course
,
you
will
deny
the
truth
of
it
,
if
it
be
untrue
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Lizzie
sat
with
her
eyes
fixed
upon
the
floor
,
but
said
nothing
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
speak
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
will
allow
me
,
Lady
Eustace
,
to
give
you
advice
,
 
really
friendly
advice
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
Oh
,
pray
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
had
better
admit
the
truth
of
the
story
,
if
it
is
true
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
were
my
own
,
"
she
whispered
.
  
<EOS>
"
Or
,
at
any
rate
,
you
believed
that
they
were
.
<EOS>
There
can
be
no
doubt
,
I
think
,
as
to
that
.
<EOS>
No
one
supposes
that
the
robbery
at
Carlisle
was
arranged
on
your
behalf
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
no
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
had
taken
them
out
of
the
box
before
you
went
to
bed
at
the
inn
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Not
then
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
had
taken
them
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
it
in
the
morning
before
I
started
from
Scotland
.
<EOS>
They
frightened
me
by
saying
the
box
would
be
stolen
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Exactly
;
 
and
then
you
put
them
into
your
desk
here
,
in
this
house
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Yes
,
 
sir
.
"
  
"
I
should
tell
you
,
Lady
Eustace
,
that
I
had
not
a
doubt
about
this
before
I
came
here
.
<EOS>
For
some
time
past
I
have
thought
that
it
must
be
so
;
and
latterly
the
confessions
of
two
of
the
accomplices
have
made
it
certain
to
me
.
<EOS>
One
of
the
housebreakers
and
the
jeweller
will
be
tried
for
the
felony
,
and
I
am
afraid
that
you
must
undergo
the
annoyance
of
being
one
of
the
witnesses
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
will
they
do
to
me
,
Major
Mackintosh
?
"
<EOS>
Lizzie
now
for
the
first
time
looked
up
into
his
eyes
,
and
felt
that
they
were
kind
.
<EOS>
Could
he
be
her
rock
?
<EOS>
He
did
not
speak
to
her
like
an
enemy
;
 
and
then
,
too
,
he
would
know
better
than
any
man
alive
how
she
might
best
escape
from
her
trouble
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
will
ask
you
to
tell
the
truth
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
I
will
do
that
,
"
said
Lizzie
,
 
not
aware
that
,
after
so
many
lies
,
it
might
be
difficult
to
tell
the
truth
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
will
probably
be
asked
to
repeat
it
,
this
way
and
that
,
in
a
manner
that
will
be
troublesome
to
you
.
<EOS>
You
see
that
here
in
London
,
and
at
Carlisle
,
you
have
 
given
incorrect
versions
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
I
have
.
<EOS>
But
the
necklace
was
my
own
.
<EOS>
There
was
nothing
dishonest
;
 
was
there
,
Major
Mackintosh
?
<EOS>
When
they
came
to
me
at
Carlisle
<EOS>
I
was
so
confused
that
I
hardly
knew
what
to
tell
them
.
<EOS>
And
when
I
had
once
 
given
an
incorrect
version
,
you
know
,
I
did
n't
know
how
to
go
back
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
major
was
not
so
well
acquainted
with
Lizzie
as
is
the
reader
,
and
he
pitied
her
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
understand
all
that
,
"
he
said
.
  
<EOS>
How
much
kinder
he
was
than
Lord
George
had
been
when
she
confessed
the
truth
to
him
.
<EOS>
Here
would
be
a
rock
!
<EOS>
And
such
a
handsome
man
as
he
was
,
too
,
 
not
exactly
a
Corsair
,
as
he
was
great
in
authority
over
the
London
police
,
 
but
a
powerful
,
fine
fellow
,
who
would
know
what
to
do
with
swords
and
pistols
as
well
as
any
Corsair
;
 
and
one
,
too
,
no
doubt
,
who
would
understand
poetry
!
<EOS>
Any
such
dream
,
however
,
was
altogether
unavailing
,
as
the
major
had
a
wife
at
home
and
seven
children
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
will
only
tell
me
what
to
do
,
I
will
do
it
,
"
she
said
,
looking
up
into
his
face
with
entreaty
,
and
pressing
her
hands
together
in
supplication
.
  
<EOS>
Then
at
great
length
,
and
with
much
patience
,
he
explained
to
her
what
he
would
have
her
do
.
<EOS>
He
thought
that
,
if
she
were
summoned
and
used
as
a
witness
,
there
would
be
no
attempt
to
prosecute
her
for
the
 
incorrect
versions
 
of
which
she
had
undoubtedly
been
guilty
.
<EOS>
The
probability
was
,
that
she
would
receive
assurance
to
this
effect
before
she
would
be
asked
to
give
her
evidence
,
preparatory
to
the
committal
of
Benjamin
and
Smiler
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
assure
her
that
it
would
be
so
,
but
he
had
no
doubt
of
it
.
<EOS>
In
order
,
however
,
that
things
might
be
made
to
run
as
smooth
as
possible
,
he
recommended
her
very
strongly
to
go
at
once
to
Mr.
Camperdown
and
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
to
him
.
<EOS>
"
The
whole
family
should
be
told
,
"
said
the
major
,
"
and
it
will
be
better
for
you
that
they
should
know
it
from
yourself
than
from
us
.
<EOS>
"
When
she
hesitated
,
he
explained
to
her
that
the
matter
could
no
longer
be
kept
as
a
secret
,
and
that
her
evidence
would
certainly
appear
in
the
papers
.
<EOS>
He
proposed
that
she
should
be
summoned
for
that
day
week
,
 
which
would
be
the
Friday
after
Lucinda
's
marriage
,
and
he
suggested
that
she
should
go
to
Mr.
Camperdown
's
on
the
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
What
!
 
<EOS>
to
-
morrow
?
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Lizzie
,
in
dismay
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Lady
Eustace
,
"
said
the
major
,
"
the
sooner
you
get
back
into
straight
running
,
the
sooner
you
will
be
comfortable
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Then
she
promised
that
she
would
go
on
the
Tuesday
,
 
the
day
after
the
marriage
.
<EOS>
"
If
he
learns
it
in
the
meantime
,
you
must
not
be
surprised
,
"
said
the
major
.
  
<EOS>
"
Tell
me
one
thing
,
Major
Mackintosh
,
"
she
said
,
as
she
gave
him
her
hand
at
parting
,
 
"
they
ca
n't
take
away
from
me
anything
that
is
my
own
;
 
can
they
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
they
can
,
"
said
the
major
,
escaping
rather
quickly
from
the
room
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
Can
not
Do
It
"
 
<EOS>
The
Saturday
and
the
Sunday
Lizzie
passed
in
outward
tranquillity
,
though
doubtless
her
mind
was
greatly
disturbed
.
<EOS>
She
said
nothing
of
what
had
passed
between
her
and
Major
Mackintosh
,
explaining
that
his
visit
had
been
made
solely
with
the
object
of
informing
her
that
Mr.
Benjamin
was
to
be
sent
home
from
Vienna
,
but
that
the
diamonds
were
gone
for
ever
.
<EOS>
She
had
,
as
she
declared
to
herself
,
agreed
with
Major
Mackintosh
that
she
would
not
go
to
Mr.
Camperdown
till
the
Tuesday
,
 
justifying
her
delay
by
her
solicitude
in
reference
to
Miss
Roanoke
's
marriage
;
and
therefore
these
two
days
were
her
own
.
<EOS>
After
them
would
come
a
totally
altered
phase
of
existence
.
<EOS>
All
the
world
would
know
the
history
of
the
diamonds
,
 
cousin
Frank
,
and
Lord
Fawn
,
and
John
Eustace
,
and
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
and
the
Bobsborough
people
,
and
Lady
Glencora
,
and
that
old
vulturess
,
her
aunt
,
the
Countess
of
Linlithgow
.
<EOS>
It
must
come
now
;
 
but
she
had
two
days
in
which
she
could
be
quiet
and
think
of
her
position
.
<EOS>
She
would
,
she
thought
,
send
one
of
her
letters
to
Lord
Fawn
before
she
went
to
Mr.
Camperdown
;
 
but
which
should
she
send
?
<EOS>
Or
should
she
write
a
third
explaining
the
whole
matter
in
sweetly
piteous
feminine
terms
,
and
swearing
that
the
only
remaining
feeling
in
her
bosom
was
a
devoted
affection
to
the
man
who
had
now
twice
promised
to
be
her
husband
?
  
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
the
preparations
for
the
great
marriage
went
on
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
spent
her
time
busily
between
Lucinda
's
bedchamber
and
the
banqueting
hall
in
Albemarle
Street
.
<EOS>
In
spite
of
pecuniary
difficulties
the
trousseau
was
to
be
a
wonder
;
and
even
Lizzie
was
astonished
at
the
jewellery
which
that
indefatigable
woman
had
collected
together
for
a
preliminary
show
in
Hertford
Street
.
<EOS>
She
had
spent
hours
at
Howell
and
James
's
,
and
had
made
marvellous
bargains
there
and
elsewhere
.
<EOS>
Things
were
sent
for
selection
,
of
which
the
greater
portion
were
to
be
returned
,
but
all
were
kept
for
the
show
.
<EOS>
The
same
things
which
were
shown
to
separate
friends
in
Hertford
Street
as
part
of
the
trousseau
on
Friday
and
Saturday
were
carried
over
to
Albemarle
Street
on
the
Sunday
,
so
as
to
add
to
the
quasi
-
public
exhibition
of
presents
on
the
Monday
.
<EOS>
The
money
expended
had
gone
very
far
.
<EOS>
The
most
had
been
made
of
a
failing
credit
.
<EOS>
Every
particle
of
friendly
generosity
had
been
so
manipulated
as
to
add
to
the
external
magnificence
.
<EOS>
And
Mrs.
Carbuncle
had
done
all
this
without
any
help
from
Lucinda
,
 
in
the
midst
of
most
contemptuous
indifference
on
Lucinda
's
part
.
<EOS>
She
could
hardly
be
got
to
allow
the
milliners
to
fit
the
dresses
to
her
body
,
and
positively
refused
to
thrust
her
feet
into
certain
golden
-
heeled
boots
with
brightly
-
bronzed
toes
,
which
were
a
great
feature
among
the
raiment
.
<EOS>
Nobody
knew
it
except
Mrs.
Carbuncle
and
the
maid
,
 
even
Lizzie
Eustace
did
not
know
it
;
 
but
once
the
bride
absolutely
ran
amuck
among
the
finery
,
scattering
the
laces
here
and
there
,
pitching
the
glove
-
boxes
under
the
bed
,
chucking
the
golden
-
heeled
boots
into
the
fire
-
place
,
and
exhibiting
quite
a
tempest
of
fury
against
one
of
the
finest
shows
of
petticoats
ever
arranged
with
a
view
to
the
admiration
and
envy
of
female
friends
.
<EOS>
But
all
this
Mrs.
Carbuncle
bore
,
and
still
persevered
.
<EOS>
The
thing
was
so
nearly
done
now
that
she
could
endure
to
persevere
though
the
provocation
to
abandon
it
was
so
great
.
<EOS>
She
had
even
ceased
to
find
fault
with
her
niece
,
 
but
went
on
in
silence
counting
the
hours
till
the
trouble
should
be
taken
off
her
own
shoulders
and
placed
on
those
of
Sir
Griffin
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
great
thing
to
her
,
almost
more
than
she
had
expected
,
that
neither
Lucinda
nor
Sir
Griffin
should
have
positively
declined
the
marriage
.
<EOS>
It
was
impossible
that
either
should
retreat
from
it
now
.
  
<EOS>
Luckily
for
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
Sir
Griffin
took
delight
in
the
show
.
<EOS>
He
did
this
after
a
bearish
fashion
,
putting
his
finger
upon
little
flaws
with
an
intelligence
for
which
Mrs.
Carbuncle
had
not
hitherto
<EOS>
given
him
credit
.
<EOS>
As
to
certain
ornaments
,
he
observed
that
the
silver
was
plated
and
the
gold
ormolu
.
<EOS>
A
"
rope
"
of
pearls
he
at
once
detected
as
being
false
,
 
and
after
fingering
certain
lace
he
turned
up
his
nose
and
shook
his
head
.
<EOS>
Then
,
on
the
Sunday
,
in
Albemarle
Street
,
he
pointed
out
to
Mrs.
Carbuncle
sundry
articles
which
he
had
seen
in
the
bedroom
on
the
Saturday
.
"
<EOS>
But
,
my
dear
Sir
Griffin
,
 
<EOS>
that
's
of
course
,
"
said
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
<EOS>
"
Oh
;
 
that
's
of
course
,
is
it
?
"
said
Sir
Griffin
,
turning
up
his
nose
again
.
<EOS>
"
Where
did
that
Delph
bowl
come
from
?
"
<EOS>
"
It
is
one
of
Mortlock
's
finest
Etruscan
vases
,
"
said
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
 
I
thought
that
Etruscan
vases
came
from
 
from
somewhere
in
Greece
or
Italy
,
"
said
Sir
Griffin
.
<EOS>
"
I
declare
that
you
are
shocking
,
"
said
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
struggling
to
maintain
her
good
humour
.
  
<EOS>
He
passed
hours
of
the
Sunday
in
Hertford
Street
,
and
Lord
George
also
was
there
for
some
time
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
,
who
could
hardly
devote
her
mind
to
the
affairs
of
the
wedding
,
remained
alone
in
her
own
sitting
-
room
during
the
greater
part
of
the
day
;
 
but
she
did
show
herself
while
Lord
George
was
there
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
So
I
hear
that
Mackintosh
has
been
here
,
"
said
Lord
George
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
 
he
was
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
did
he
say
?
<EOS>
"
Lizzie
did
not
like
the
way
in
which
the
man
looked
at
her
,
feeling
it
to
be
not
only
unfriendly
,
but
absolutely
cruel
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
to
imply
that
he
knew
that
her
secret
was
about
to
be
divulged
.
<EOS>
And
what
was
he
to
her
now
that
he
should
be
impertinent
to
her
?
<EOS>
What
he
knew
,
all
the
world
would
know
before
the
end
of
the
week
.
<EOS>
And
that
other
man
who
knew
it
already
,
had
been
kind
to
her
,
had
said
nothing
about
perjury
,
but
had
explained
to
her
that
what
she
would
have
to
bear
would
be
trouble
,
and
not
imprisonment
and
loss
of
money
.
<EOS>
Lord
George
,
to
whom
she
had
been
so
civil
,
for
whom
she
had
spent
money
,
to
whom
she
had
almost
offered
herself
and
all
that
she
possessed
,
 
Lord
George
,
whom
she
had
selected
as
the
first
repository
of
her
secret
,
had
spoken
no
word
to
comfort
her
,
but
had
made
things
look
worse
for
her
than
they
were
.
<EOS>
Why
should
she
submit
to
be
questioned
by
Lord
George
?
<EOS>
In
a
day
or
two
the
secret
which
he
knew
would
be
no
secret
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Never
mind
what
he
said
,
Lord
George
,
"
she
replied
.
  
<EOS>
"
Has
he
found
it
all
out
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
had
better
go
and
ask
himself
,
"
said
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
sick
of
the
subject
,
and
I
mean
to
have
done
with
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Lord
George
laughed
,
and
Lizzie
hated
him
for
his
laugh
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
declare
,
"
said
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
"
that
you
two
who
were
such
friends
are
always
snapping
at
each
other
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
fickleness
is
all
on
her
ladyship
's
part
,
 
not
on
mine
,
"
said
Lord
George
;
whereupon
Lady
Eustace
walked
out
of
the
room
and
was
not
seen
again
till
dinner
-
time
.
  
<EOS>
Soon
afterwards
Lucinda
also
endeavoured
to
escape
,
but
to
this
Sir
Griffin
objected
.
<EOS>
Sir
Griffin
was
in
a
very
good
humour
,
and
bore
himself
like
a
prosperous
bridegroom
.
<EOS>
"
Come
,
Luce
,
"
he
said
,
"
get
off
your
high
horse
for
a
little
.
<EOS>
To
-
morrow
,
you
know
,
you
must
come
down
altogether
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
So
much
the
more
reason
for
my
remaining
up
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
be
shot
if
you
shall
,
"
said
Sir
Griffin
.
<EOS>
"
Luce
,
sit
in
my
lap
,
and
give
me
a
kiss
.
"
  
<EOS>
At
this
moment
Lord
George
and
Mrs.
Carbuncle
were
in
the
front
drawing
-
room
,
and
Lord
George
was
telling
her
the
true
story
as
to
the
necklace
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
explained
on
his
behalf
that
in
doing
this
he
did
not
consider
that
he
was
betraying
the
trust
reposed
in
him
.
<EOS>
"
They
know
all
about
it
in
Scotland
Yard
,
"
he
said
;
"
I
got
it
from
Gager
.
<EOS>
They
were
bound
to
tell
me
,
as
up
to
this
week
past
every
man
in
the
police
thought
that
I
had
been
the
master
-
mind
among
the
thieves
.
<EOS>
When
I
think
of
it
<EOS>
I
hardly
know
whether
to
laugh
or
cry
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
she
had
them
all
the
time
?
"
exclaimed
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
 
in
this
house
!
<EOS>
Did
you
ever
hear
of
such
a
little
cat
?
<EOS>
I
could
tell
you
more
than
that
.
<EOS>
She
wanted
me
to
take
them
and
dispose
of
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
did
though
;
 
and
now
see
the
way
she
treats
me
!
<EOS>
Never
mind
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
say
a
word
to
her
about
it
till
it
comes
out
of
itself
.
<EOS>
She
'll
have
to
be
arrested
,
no
doubt
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Arrested
!
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
's
further
exclamations
were
stopped
by
Lucinda
's
struggles
in
the
other
room
.
<EOS>
She
had
declined
to
sit
upon
the
bridegroom
's
lap
,
but
had
acknowledged
that
she
was
bound
to
submit
to
be
kissed
.
<EOS>
He
had
kissed
her
,
and
then
had
striven
to
drag
her
on
to
his
knee
.
<EOS>
But
she
was
strong
,
and
had
resisted
violently
,
and
,
as
he
afterwards
said
,
had
struck
him
savagely
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Of
course
I
struck
him
,
"
said
Lucinda
.
  
<EOS>
"
By
 
---
,
you
shall
pay
for
it
!
"
said
Sir
Griffin
.
<EOS>
This
took
place
in
the
presence
of
Lord
George
and
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
and
yet
they
were
to
be
married
to
-
morrow
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
idea
of
complaining
that
a
girl
hit
you
,
 
and
the
girl
who
is
to
be
your
wife
!
"
said
Lord
George
,
as
they
walked
off
together
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
what
to
complain
of
,
and
what
not
,
"
said
Sir
Griffin
.
<EOS>
"
Are
you
going
to
let
me
have
that
money
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
 
I
am
not
,
"
said
Lord
George
,
 
"
<EOS>
so
there
's
an
end
of
that
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
they
dined
together
at
their
club
afterwards
,
and
in
the
evening
Sir
Griffin
was
again
in
Hertford
Street
.
  
<EOS>
This
happened
on
the
Sunday
,
on
which
day
none
of
the
ladies
had
gone
to
church
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Emilius
well
understood
the
cause
of
their
absence
,
and
felt
nothing
of
a
parson
's
anger
at
it
.
<EOS>
He
was
to
marry
the
couple
on
the
Monday
morning
,
and
dined
with
the
ladies
on
the
Sunday
.
<EOS>
He
was
peculiarly
gracious
and
smiling
,
and
spoke
of
the
Hymeneals
as
though
they
were
even
more
than
ordinarily
joyful
and
happy
in
their
promise
.
<EOS>
To
Lizzie
he
was
almost
affectionate
,
and
Mrs.
Carbuncle
he
flattered
to
the
top
of
her
bent
.
<EOS>
The
power
of
the
man
in
being
sprightly
under
such
a
load
of
trouble
as
oppressed
the
household
,
was
wonderful
.
<EOS>
He
had
to
do
with
three
women
who
were
worldly
,
hard
,
and
given
entirely
to
evil
things
.
<EOS>
Even
as
regarded
the
bride
,
who
felt
the
horror
of
her
position
,
so
much
must
be
in
truth
admitted
.
<EOS>
Though
from
day
to
day
and
hour
to
hour
she
would
openly
declare
her
hatred
of
the
things
around
her
,
 
yet
she
went
on
.
<EOS>
Since
she
had
entered
upon
life
she
had
known
nothing
but
falsehood
and
scheming
wickedness
;
 
and
,
though
she
rebelled
against
the
consequences
,
she
had
not
rebelled
against
the
wickedness
.
<EOS>
Now
to
this
unfortunate
young
woman
and
her
two
companions
,
Mr.
Emilius
discoursed
with
an
unctuous
mixture
of
celestial
and
terrestrial
glorification
,
which
was
proof
,
at
any
rate
,
of
great
ability
on
his
part
.
<EOS>
He
told
them
how
a
good
wife
was
a
crown
,
or
rather
a
chaplet
of
aetherial
roses
to
her
husband
,
and
<EOS>
how
high
rank
and
great
station
in
the
world
made
such
a
chaplet
more
beautiful
and
more
valuable
.
<EOS>
His
work
in
the
vineyard
,
he
said
,
had
fallen
lately
among
the
wealthy
and
nobly
born
;
and
though
he
would
not
say
that
he
was
entitled
to
take
glory
on
that
account
,
still
he
gave
thanks
daily
in
that
he
had
been
enabled
to
give
his
humble
assistance
towards
the
running
of
a
godly
life
to
those
who
,
by
their
example
,
were
enabled
to
have
so
wide
an
effect
upon
their
poorer
fellow
-
creatures
.
<EOS>
He
knew
well
how
difficult
it
was
for
a
camel
to
go
through
the
eye
of
a
needle
.
<EOS>
They
had
the
highest
possible
authority
for
that
.
<EOS>
But
Scripture
never
said
that
the
camel
,
 
which
,
as
he
explained
it
,
was
simply
a
thread
larger
than
ordinary
thread
,
 
could
not
go
through
the
needle
's
eye
.
<EOS>
The
camel
which
succeeded
,
in
spite
of
the
difficulties
attending
its
exalted
position
,
would
be
peculiarly
blessed
.
<EOS>
And
he
went
on
to
suggest
that
the
three
ladies
before
him
,
one
of
whom
was
about
to
enter
upon
a
new
phase
of
life
to
-
morrow
,
under
auspices
peculiarly
propitious
,
were
,
all
of
them
,
camels
of
this
description
.
<EOS>
Sir
Griffin
,
when
he
came
in
,
received
for
a
while
the
peculiar
attention
of
Mr.
Emilius
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
Sir
Griffin
,
"
he
commenced
,
"
that
no
period
of
a
man
's
life
is
so
blessed
,
as
that
upon
which
you
will
enter
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
This
he
said
in
a
whisper
,
but
it
was
a
whisper
audible
to
the
ladies
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
;
 
yes
;
it
's
all
right
,
I
daresay
,
"
said
Sir
Griffin
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
after
all
,
what
is
life
till
a
man
has
met
and
obtained
the
partner
of
his
soul
?
<EOS>
It
is
a
blank
,
 
and
the
blank
becomes
every
day
more
and
more
intolerable
to
the
miserable
solitary
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
you
do
n't
get
married
yourself
,
"
said
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
who
perceived
that
Sir
Griffin
was
rather
astray
for
an
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
 
<EOS>
if
one
could
always
be
fortunate
when
one
loved
!
"
said
Mr.
Emilius
,
casting
his
eyes
across
to
Lizzie
Eustace
.
<EOS>
It
was
evident
to
them
all
that
he
did
not
wish
to
conceal
his
passion
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
the
object
of
Mrs.
Carbuncle
that
the
lovers
should
not
be
left
alone
together
,
but
that
they
should
be
made
to
think
that
they
were
passing
the
evening
in
affectionate
intercourse
.
<EOS>
Lucinda
hardly
spoke
,
hardly
had
spoken
since
her
disagreeable
struggle
with
Sir
Griffin
.
<EOS>
He
said
but
little
,
but
with
Mrs.
Carbuncle
was
better
humoured
than
usual
.
<EOS>
Every
now
<EOS>
and
then
she
made
little
whispered
communications
to
him
,
telling
that
they
would
be
sure
to
be
at
the
church
at
eleven
to
the
moment
,
explaining
to
him
what
would
be
the
extent
of
Lucinda
's
boxes
for
the
wedding
tour
,
and
assuring
him
that
he
would
find
Lucinda
's
new
maid
a
treasure
in
regard
to
his
own
shirts
and
pocket
-
handkerchiefs
.
<EOS>
She
toiled
marvellously
at
little
subjects
,
always
making
some
allusion
to
Lucinda
,
and
never
hinting
that
aught
short
of
Elysium
was
in
store
for
him
.
<EOS>
The
labour
was
great
;
the
task
was
terrible
;
but
now
it
was
so
nearly
over
!
<EOS>
And
to
Lizzie
she
was
very
courteous
,
never
hinting
by
a
word
or
a
look
that
there
was
any
new
trouble
impending
on
the
score
of
the
diamonds
.
<EOS>
She
,
too
,
as
she
received
the
greasy
compliments
of
Mr.
Emilius
with
pretty
smiles
,
had
her
mind
full
enough
of
care
.
  
<EOS>
At
last
Sir
Griffin
went
,
again
kissing
his
bride
as
he
left
.
<EOS>
Lucinda
accepted
his
embrace
without
a
word
and
almost
without
a
shudder
.
<EOS>
"
Eleven
to
the
moment
,
Sir
Griffin
,
"
said
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
with
her
best
good
humour
.
<EOS>
"
All
right
,
"
said
Sir
Griffin
as
he
passed
out
of
the
door
.
<EOS>
Lucinda
walked
across
the
room
,
and
kept
her
eyes
fixed
on
his
retreating
figure
as
he
descended
the
stairs
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Emilius
had
already
departed
,
with
many
promises
of
punctuality
,
and
Lizzie
now
withdrew
for
the
night
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Dear
Lizzie
,
good
night
,
"
said
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
kissing
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Good
night
,
Lady
Eustace
,
"
said
Lucinda
.
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
I
shall
see
you
to
-
morrow
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
See
me
!
 
<EOS>
of
course
you
will
see
me
.
<EOS>
I
shall
come
into
your
room
with
the
girls
,
after
you
have
had
your
tea
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
girls
mentioned
were
the
four
bridesmaids
,
as
to
whom
there
had
been
some
difficulty
,
as
Lucinda
had
neither
sister
nor
cousins
,
and
had
contracted
no
peculiarly
tender
friendships
.
<EOS>
But
Mrs.
Carbuncle
had
arranged
it
,
and
four
properly
-
equipped
young
ladies
were
to
be
in
attendance
at
ten
on
the
morrow
.
  
<EOS>
Then
Lucinda
and
Mrs.
Carbuncle
were
alone
.
<EOS>
"
Of
one
thing
I
feel
sure
,
"
said
Lucinda
in
a
low
voice
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
that
,
dear
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
never
see
Sir
Griffin
Tewett
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
talk
in
that
way
on
purpose
to
break
me
down
at
the
last
moment
,
"
said
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
Aunt
Jane
,
I
would
not
break
you
down
if
I
could
help
it
.
<EOS>
I
have
struggled
so
hard
,
 
simply
that
you
might
be
freed
from
me
.
<EOS>
We
have
been
very
foolish
,
both
of
us
;
but
I
would
bear
all
the
punishment
,
 
if
I
could
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
that
this
is
nonsense
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
well
.
<EOS>
I
only
tell
you
.
<EOS>
I
know
that
I
shall
never
see
him
again
.
<EOS>
I
will
never
trust
myself
alone
in
his
presence
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
do
it
.
<EOS>
When
he
touches
me
my
whole
body
is
in
agony
.
<EOS>
To
be
kissed
by
him
is
madness
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Lucinda
,
this
is
very
wicked
.
<EOS>
You
are
working
yourself
up
to
a
paroxysm
of
folly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Wicked
;
 
yes
,
I
know
that
I
am
wicked
.
<EOS>
There
has
been
enough
of
wickedness
certainly
.
<EOS>
You
do
n't
suppose
that
I
mean
to
excuse
myself
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
you
will
marry
Sir
Griffin
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
never
be
married
to
him
.
<EOS>
How
I
shall
escape
from
him
,
 
by
dying
,
or
going
mad
,
 
or
by
destroying
him
,
God
only
knows
.
<EOS>
"
Then
she
paused
,
and
her
aunt
looking
into
her
face
almost
began
to
fear
that
she
was
in
earnest
.
<EOS>
But
she
would
not
take
it
as
at
all
indicating
any
real
result
for
the
morrow
.
<EOS>
The
girl
had
often
said
nearly
the
same
thing
before
,
and
had
still
submitted
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Do
you
know
,
Aunt
Jane
,
I
do
n't
think
I
could
feel
to
any
man
as
though
I
loved
him
.
<EOS>
But
for
this
man
,
 
Oh
God
,
how
I
do
detest
him
!
<EOS>
I
can
not
do
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
had
better
go
to
bed
,
Lucinda
,
and
let
me
come
to
you
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
 
come
to
me
in
the
morning
;
 
early
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
,
 
at
eight
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
know
then
,
perhaps
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
will
you
come
to
my
room
to
-
night
,
and
sleep
with
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
no
.
<EOS>
I
have
ever
so
many
things
to
do
.
<EOS>
I
have
papers
to
burn
,
and
things
to
put
away
.
<EOS>
But
come
to
me
at
eight
.
<EOS>
Good
night
,
Aunt
Jane
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
went
up
to
her
room
with
her
,
kissed
her
affectionately
,
and
then
left
her
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
now
really
frightened
.
<EOS>
What
would
be
said
of
her
if
she
should
press
the
marriage
forward
to
a
completion
,
and
if
after
that
some
terrible
tragedy
should
take
place
between
the
bride
and
bridegroom
?
<EOS>
That
Lucinda
,
in
spite
of
all
that
had
been
said
,
would
stand
at
the
altar
,
and
allow
the
ceremony
to
be
performed
,
she
still
believed
.
<EOS>
Those
last
words
about
burning
papers
and
putting
things
away
,
seemed
to
imply
that
the
girl
still
thought
that
she
would
be
taken
away
from
her
present
home
on
the
morrow
.
<EOS>
But
what
would
come
afterwards
?
<EOS>
The
horror
which
the
bride
expressed
was
,
as
Mrs.
Carbuncle
well
knew
,
no
mock
feeling
,
no
pretence
at
antipathy
.
<EOS>
She
tried
to
think
of
it
,
and
to
realise
what
might
in
truth
be
the
girl
's
action
and
ultimate
fate
when
she
should
find
herself
in
the
power
of
this
man
whom
she
so
hated
.
<EOS>
But
had
not
other
girls
done
the
same
thing
,
and
lived
through
it
all
,
and
become
fat
,
indifferent
,
and
fond
of
the
world
?
<EOS>
It
is
only
the
first
step
that
signifies
.
  
<EOS>
At
any
rate
,
the
thing
must
go
on
now
;
 
must
go
on
,
whatever
might
be
the
result
to
Lucinda
or
to
Mrs.
Carbuncle
herself
.
<EOS>
Yes
;
it
must
go
on
.
<EOS>
There
was
,
no
doubt
,
very
much
of
bitterness
in
the
world
for
such
as
them
,
 
for
persons
doomed
by
the
necessities
of
their
position
to
a
continual
struggle
.
<EOS>
It
always
had
been
so
,
and
always
would
be
so
.
<EOS>
But
each
bitter
cup
must
be
drained
in
the
hope
that
the
next
might
be
sweeter
.
<EOS>
Of
course
the
marriage
must
go
on
;
though
,
doubtless
,
this
cup
was
very
bitter
.
  
<EOS>
More
than
once
in
the
night
Mrs.
Carbuncle
crept
up
to
the
door
of
her
niece
's
room
,
endeavouring
to
ascertain
what
might
be
going
on
within
.
<EOS>
At
two
o'clock
,
while
she
was
on
the
landing
-
place
,
the
candle
was
extinguished
,
and
she
could
hear
that
Lucinda
put
herself
to
bed
.
<EOS>
At
any
rate
,
so
far
,
things
were
safe
.
<EOS>
An
indistinct
,
incompleted
idea
of
some
possible
tragedy
had
flitted
across
the
mind
of
the
poor
woman
,
causing
her
to
shake
and
tremble
,
forbidding
her
,
weary
as
she
was
,
to
lie
down
;
 
but
now
she
told
herself
at
last
that
this
was
an
idle
phantasy
,
and
she
went
to
bed
.
<EOS>
Of
course
Lucinda
must
go
through
with
it
.
<EOS>
It
had
been
her
own
doing
,
and
Sir
Griffin
was
not
worse
than
other
men
.
<EOS>
As
she
said
this
to
herself
,
Mrs.
Carbuncle
hardened
her
heart
by
remembering
that
her
own
married
life
had
not
been
peculiarly
happy
.
  
<EOS>
Exactly
at
eight
on
the
following
morning
she
knocked
at
her
niece
's
door
,
and
was
at
once
bidden
to
enter
.
<EOS>
"
Come
in
,
Aunt
Jane
.
<EOS>
"
The
words
cheered
her
wonderfully
.
<EOS>
At
any
rate
,
there
had
been
no
tragedy
as
yet
,
and
as
she
turned
the
handle
of
the
door
,
she
felt
that
,
as
a
matter
of
course
,
the
marriage
would
go
on
just
like
any
other
marriage
.
<EOS>
She
found
Lucinda
up
and
dressed
,
 
but
so
dressed
as
certainly
to
show
no
preparation
for
a
wedding
-
toilet
.
<EOS>
She
had
on
an
ordinary
stuff
morning
frock
,
and
her
hair
was
close
tucked
up
and
pinned
,
<EOS>
as
it
might
have
been
had
she
already
prepared
herself
for
a
journey
.
<EOS>
But
what
astonished
Mrs.
Carbuncle
more
than
the
dress
was
the
girl
's
manner
.
<EOS>
She
was
sitting
at
a
table
with
a
book
before
her
,
which
was
afterwards
found
to
be
the
Bible
,
and
she
never
turned
her
head
as
her
aunt
entered
the
room
.
<EOS>
"
What
,
up
already
,
"
said
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
 
"
and
dressed
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Yes
;
I
am
up
,
 
and
dressed
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
up
ever
so
long
.
<EOS>
How
was
I
to
lie
in
bed
on
such
a
morning
as
this
?
<EOS>
Aunt
Jane
,
I
wish
you
to
know
as
soon
as
possible
that
no
earthly
consideration
will
induce
me
to
leave
this
room
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
What
nonsense
,
Lucinda
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
well
;
 
all
the
same
you
might
as
well
believe
me
.
<EOS>
I
want
you
to
send
to
Mr.
Emilius
,
and
to
those
girls
,
 
and
to
the
man
.
<EOS>
And
you
had
better
get
Lord
George
to
let
the
other
people
know
.
<EOS>
I
'm
quite
in
earnest
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
she
was
in
earnest
,
 
quite
in
earnest
,
though
there
was
a
flightiness
about
her
manner
which
induced
Mrs.
Carbuncle
for
awhile
to
think
that
she
was
less
so
than
she
had
been
on
the
previous
evening
.
<EOS>
The
unfortunate
woman
remained
with
her
niece
for
an
hour
and
a
half
,
imploring
,
threatening
,
scolding
,
and
weeping
.
<EOS>
When
the
maids
came
to
the
door
,
first
one
maid
and
then
another
,
they
were
refused
entrance
.
<EOS>
It
might
still
be
possible
,
Mrs.
Carbuncle
thought
,
that
she
would
prevail
.
<EOS>
But
nothing
now
could
shake
Lucinda
or
induce
her
even
to
discuss
the
subject
.
<EOS>
She
sat
there
looking
steadfastly
at
the
book
,
 
hardly
answering
,
never
defending
herself
,
but
protesting
that
nothing
should
induce
her
to
leave
the
room
on
that
day
.
<EOS>
"
Do
you
want
to
destroy
me
?
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
said
at
last
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
destroyed
me
,
"
said
Lucinda
.
  
<EOS>
At
half
-
past
nine
Lizzie
Eustace
came
to
the
room
,
and
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
in
her
trouble
,
thought
it
better
to
take
other
counsel
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
,
therefore
,
was
admitted
.
<EOS>
"
Is
anything
wrong
?
"
asked
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
"
Everything
is
wrong
,
"
said
the
aunt
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
says
that
 
she
wo
n't
be
married
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Lucinda
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Pray
speak
to
her
,
Lady
Eustace
.
<EOS>
You
see
it
is
getting
so
late
,
and
she
ought
to
be
nearly
dressed
now
.
<EOS>
Of
course
she
must
allow
herself
to
be
dressed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
dressed
,
"
said
Lucinda
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
dear
Lucinda
,
 
everybody
will
be
waiting
for
you
,
"
said
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
"
Let
them
wait
,
 
till
they
're
tired
.
<EOS>
If
Aunt
Jane
does
n't
choose
to
send
,
it
is
not
my
fault
.
<EOS>
I
sha'n't
go
out
of
this
room
to
-
day
unless
I
am
carried
out
.
<EOS>
Do
you
want
to
hear
that
I
have
murdered
the
man
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
They
brought
her
tea
,
and
endeavoured
to
induce
her
to
eat
and
drink
.
<EOS>
She
would
take
the
tea
,
she
said
,
if
they
would
promise
to
send
to
put
the
people
off
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
so
far
gave
way
as
to
undertake
to
do
so
,
if
she
would
name
the
next
day
or
the
day
following
for
the
wedding
.
<EOS>
But
on
hearing
this
she
arose
almost
in
a
majesty
of
wrath
.
<EOS>
Neither
on
this
day
,
or
on
the
next
,
or
on
any
following
day
,
would
she
yield
herself
to
the
wretch
whom
they
had
endeavoured
to
force
upon
her
.
"
<EOS>
She
must
do
it
,
you
know
,
"
said
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
turning
to
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
"
You
'll
see
if
I
must
,
"
said
Lucinda
,
sitting
square
at
the
table
,
with
her
eyes
firmly
fixed
upon
the
book
.
  
<EOS>
Then
came
up
the
servant
to
say
that
the
four
bridesmaids
were
all
assembled
in
the
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
When
she
heard
this
,
even
Mrs.
Carbuncle
gave
way
,
and
threw
herself
upon
the
bed
and
wept
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
Lady
Eustace
,
what
are
we
to
do
?
<EOS>
Lucinda
,
you
have
destroyed
me
.
<EOS>
You
have
destroyed
me
altogether
,
after
all
that
I
have
done
for
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
has
been
done
to
me
,
do
you
think
?
"
said
Lucinda
.
  
<EOS>
Something
must
be
settled
.
<EOS>
All
the
servants
in
the
house
by
this
time
knew
that
there
would
be
no
wedding
,
and
no
doubt
some
tidings
as
to
the
misadventure
of
the
day
had
already
reached
the
four
ladies
in
the
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
"
What
am
I
to
do
?
"
said
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
starting
up
from
the
bed
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
really
think
you
had
better
send
to
Mr.
Emilius
,
"
said
Lizzie
;
 
"
and
to
Lord
George
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
am
I
to
say
?
<EOS>
Who
is
there
to
go
?
<EOS>
Oh
,
 
I
wish
that
somebody
would
kill
me
this
minute
!
<EOS>
Lady
Eustace
,
would
you
mind
going
down
and
telling
those
ladies
to
go
away
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
had
I
not
better
send
Richard
to
the
church
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
yes
;
 
send
anybody
everywhere
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
what
to
do
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
Lucinda
,
this
is
the
unkindest
and
the
wickedest
,
and
the
most
horrible
thing
that
anybody
ever
did
!
<EOS>
I
shall
never
,
never
be
able
to
hold
up
my
head
again
.
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
was
completely
prostrate
,
but
Lucinda
sat
square
at
the
table
,
firm
as
a
rock
,
saying
nothing
,
making
no
excuse
for
herself
,
with
her
eyes
fixed
upon
the
Bible
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Eustace
carried
her
message
to
the
astonished
and
indignant
bridesmaids
,
and
succeeded
in
sending
them
back
to
their
respective
homes
.
<EOS>
Richard
,
glorious
in
new
livery
,
forgetting
that
his
flowers
were
still
on
his
breast
,
 
ready
dressed
to
attend
the
bride
's
carriage
,
 
went
with
his
sad
message
,
first
to
the
church
and
then
to
the
banqueting
-
hall
in
Albemarle
Street
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
any
wedding
?
"
said
the
head
-
waiter
at
the
hotel
.
<EOS>
"
I
knew
they
was
folks
as
would
have
a
screw
loose
somewheres
.
<EOS>
There
's
lots
to
stand
for
the
bill
,
anyways
<EOS>
,
"
he
added
,
as
he
remembered
all
the
tribute
.
   
<EOS>
Alas
!
 
<EOS>
No
attempt
was
made
to
send
other
messages
from
Hertford
Street
than
those
which
were
taken
to
the
church
and
to
the
hotel
.
<EOS>
Sir
Griffin
and
Lord
George
went
together
to
the
church
in
a
brougham
,
and
,
on
the
way
,
the
best
man
rather
ridiculed
the
change
in
life
which
he
supposed
that
his
friend
was
about
to
make
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
in
the
least
know
how
you
mean
to
get
along
,
"
said
Lord
George
.
  
<EOS>
"
Much
as
other
men
do
,
I
suppose
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
're
always
sparring
,
already
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
that
old
woman
that
you
're
so
fond
of
,
"
said
Sir
Griffin
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
mean
to
have
any
ill
-
humour
from
my
wife
,
I
can
tell
you
.
<EOS>
I
know
who
will
have
the
worst
of
it
if
there
is
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
word
,
I
think
you
'll
have
your
hands
full
,
"
said
Lord
George
.
<EOS>
They
got
out
at
a
sort
of
private
door
attached
to
the
chapel
,
and
were
there
received
by
the
clerk
,
who
wore
a
very
long
face
.
<EOS>
The
news
had
already
come
,
and
had
been
communicated
to
Mr.
Emilius
,
who
was
in
the
vestry
.
"
<EOS>
Are
the
ladies
here
yet
?
"
asked
Lord
George
.
<EOS>
The
woebegone
clerk
told
them
that
the
ladies
were
not
yet
there
,
and
suggested
that
they
should
see
Mr.
Emilius
.
<EOS>
Into
the
presence
of
Mr.
Emilius
they
were
led
,
and
then
they
heard
the
truth
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
Griffin
,
"
said
Mr.
Emilius
,
holding
the
baronet
by
the
hand
,
"
I
'm
sorry
to
have
to
tell
you
that
there
's
something
wrong
in
Hertford
Street
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
's
wrong
?
"
asked
Sir
Griffin
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
mean
to
say
that
Miss
Roanoke
is
not
to
be
here
?
"
demanded
Lord
George
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
By
George
,
I
thought
as
much
.
<EOS>
I
did
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
only
tell
you
what
I
know
,
Lord
George
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
's
servant
was
here
ten
minutes
since
,
Sir
Griffin
,
 
before
I
came
down
,
and
he
told
the
clerk
that
 
that
 
"
  
"
What
the
d
 
---
did
he
tell
him
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Sir
Griffin
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
said
that
Miss
Roanoke
had
changed
her
mind
,
and
did
n't
mean
to
be
married
at
all
.
<EOS>
That
's
all
that
I
can
learn
from
what
he
says
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
you
will
think
it
best
to
go
up
to
Hertford
Street
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
be
 
---
if
I
do
,
"
said
Sir
Griffin
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
in
the
least
surprised
,
"
repeated
Lord
George
.
<EOS>
"
Tewett
,
my
boy
,
we
might
as
well
go
home
to
lunch
,
and
the
sooner
you
're
out
of
town
the
better
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
knew
that
I
should
be
taken
in
at
last
by
that
accursed
woman
,
"
said
Sir
Griffin
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
n't
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
if
you
mean
that
.
<EOS>
She
'd
have
given
her
left
hand
to
have
had
it
completed
.
<EOS>
I
rather
think
you
've
had
an
escape
,
Griff
;
and
if
I
were
you
,
I
'd
make
the
best
of
it
.
"
<EOS>
Sir
Griffin
spoke
not
another
word
,
but
left
the
church
with
his
friend
in
the
brougham
that
had
brought
them
,
and
so
he
disappears
from
our
story
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Emilius
looked
after
him
with
wistful
eyes
,
regretful
for
his
fee
.
<EOS>
Had
the
baronet
been
less
coarse
and
violent
in
his
language
he
would
have
asked
for
it
;
but
he
feared
that
he
might
be
cursed
in
his
own
church
,
before
his
clerk
,
and
abstained
.
<EOS>
Late
in
the
afternoon
Lord
George
,
when
he
had
administered
comfort
to
the
disappointed
bridegroom
in
the
shape
of
a
hot
lunch
,
Curaçoa
,
and
cigars
,
walked
up
to
Hertford
Street
,
calling
at
the
hotel
in
Albemarle
Street
on
the
way
.
<EOS>
The
waiter
told
him
all
that
he
knew
.
<EOS>
Some
thirty
or
forty
guests
had
come
to
the
wedding
-
banquet
,
and
had
all
been
sent
away
with
tidings
that
the
marriage
had
been
 
postponed
.
<EOS>
"
You
might
have
told
"
em
a
trifle
more
than
that
,
"
said
Lord
George
.
<EOS>
"
Postponed
was
pleasantest
,
my
lord
,
"
said
the
waiter
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Anyways
,
that
was
said
,
and
we
supposes
,
my
lord
,
as
the
things
ai
n't
wanted
now
.
"
<EOS>
Lord
George
replied
that
,
as
far
as
he
knew
,
the
things
were
not
wanted
,
and
then
continued
his
way
up
to
Hertford
Street
.
  
<EOS>
At
first
he
saw
Lizzie
Eustace
,
upon
whom
the
misfortune
of
the
day
had
had
a
most
depressing
effect
.
<EOS>
The
wedding
was
to
have
been
the
one
morsel
of
pleasing
excitement
which
would
come
before
she
underwent
the
humble
penance
to
which
she
was
doomed
.
<EOS>
That
was
frustrated
and
abandoned
,
and
now
she
could
think
only
of
Mr.
Camperdown
,
her
cousin
Frank
,
and
Lady
Glencora
Palliser
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
's
up
now
?
"
said
Lord
George
,
with
that
disrespect
which
had
always
accompanied
his
treatment
of
her
since
she
had
told
him
her
secret
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
's
the
meaning
of
all
this
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
daresay
that
you
know
as
well
as
I
do
,
my
lord
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
know
a
good
deal
if
I
do
.
<EOS>
It
seems
that
among
you
there
is
nothing
but
one
trick
upon
another
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
you
are
speaking
of
your
own
friends
,
Lord
George
.
<EOS>
You
doubtless
know
much
more
than
I
do
of
Miss
Roanoke
's
affairs
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Does
she
mean
to
say
that
she
does
n't
mean
to
marry
the
man
at
all
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
So
I
understand
;
 
but
really
you
had
better
send
for
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
did
send
for
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
and
after
some
words
with
her
,
was
taken
up
into
Lucinda
's
room
.
<EOS>
There
sat
the
unfortunate
girl
,
in
the
chair
from
which
she
had
not
moved
since
the
morning
.
<EOS>
There
had
come
over
her
face
a
look
of
fixed
but
almost
idiotic
resolution
;
her
mouth
was
compressed
,
and
her
eyes
were
glazed
,
and
she
sat
twiddling
her
book
before
her
with
her
fingers
.
<EOS>
She
had
eaten
nothing
since
she
had
got
up
,
and
had
long
ceased
to
be
violent
when
questioned
by
her
aunt
.
<EOS>
But
,
nevertheless
,
she
was
firm
enough
when
her
aunt
begged
to
be
allowed
to
write
a
letter
to
Sir
Griffin
,
explaining
that
all
this
had
arisen
from
temporary
indisposition
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
;
it
is
n't
temporary
.
<EOS>
It
is
n't
temporary
at
all
.
<EOS>
You
can
write
to
him
;
but
I
'll
never
come
out
of
this
room
if
I
am
told
that
I
am
to
see
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
all
this
about
,
Lucinda
?
"
said
Lord
George
,
speaking
in
his
kindest
voice
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
he
there
?
"
<EOS>
said
she
,
turning
round
suddenly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
Griffin
?
 
<EOS>
no
indeed
.
<EOS>
He
has
left
town
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
're
sure
he
's
not
there
?
<EOS>
It
's
no
good
his
coming
.
<EOS>
If
he
comes
for
ever
and
ever
he
shall
never
touch
me
again
;
 
not
alive
;
he
shall
never
touch
me
again
alive
.
"
<EOS>
As
she
spoke
she
moved
across
the
room
to
the
fire
-
place
and
grasped
the
poker
in
her
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
Has
she
been
like
that
all
the
morning
?
<EOS>
"
whispered
Lord
George
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
 
not
like
.
<EOS>
She
has
been
quite
quiet
.
<EOS>
Lucinda
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
let
him
come
here
,
then
;
that
's
all
.
<EOS>
What
's
the
use
?
<EOS>
They
ca
n't
make
me
marry
him
.
<EOS>
And
I
wo
n't
marry
him
.
<EOS>
Everybody
has
known
that
I
hated
him
,
 
detested
him
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
Lord
George
,
it
has
been
very
,
very
cruel
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Has
it
been
my
fault
,
Lucinda
?
"
  
"
She
would
n't
have
done
it
if
you
had
told
her
not
.
<EOS>
But
you
wo
n't
bring
him
again
;
 
will
you
?
"
  
"
Certainly
not
.
<EOS>
He
means
to
go
abroad
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
 
yes
;
that
will
be
best
.
<EOS>
Let
him
go
abroad
.
<EOS>
He
knew
it
all
the
time
,
 
that
I
hated
him
.
<EOS>
Why
did
he
want
me
to
be
his
wife
?
<EOS>
If
he
has
gone
abroad
,
I
will
go
down
-
stairs
.
<EOS>
But
I
wo
n't
go
out
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
Nothing
shall
make
me
go
out
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
Are
the
bridesmaids
gone
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Long
ago
,
"
said
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
piteously
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
I
will
go
down
.
"
<EOS>
And
,
between
them
,
they
led
her
into
the
drawing
-
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
my
belief
,
"
said
Lord
George
to
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
some
minutes
afterwards
,
"
that
you
have
driven
her
mad
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
going
to
turn
against
me
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
true
.
<EOS>
How
you
have
had
the
heart
to
go
on
pressing
it
upon
her
,
I
could
never
understand
.
<EOS>
I
am
about
as
hard
as
a
milestone
,
but
I
'll
be
shot
if
I
could
have
done
it
.
<EOS>
From
day
to
day
I
thought
that
you
would
have
given
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
so
like
a
man
,
 
when
it
is
all
over
,
to
turn
upon
a
woman
and
say
that
she
did
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
n't
you
do
it
?
<EOS>
I
thought
you
did
,
and
that
you
took
a
great
deal
of
pride
in
the
doing
of
it
.
<EOS>
When
you
made
him
offer
to
her
down
in
Scotland
,
and
made
her
accept
him
,
you
were
so
proud
that
you
could
hardly
hold
yourself
.
<EOS>
What
will
you
do
now
?
<EOS>
Go
on
just
as
though
nothing
had
happened
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
what
we
shall
do
.
<EOS>
There
will
be
so
many
things
to
be
paid
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
think
there
would
,
 
and
you
can
hardly
expect
Sir
Griffin
to
pay
for
them
.
<EOS>
You
'll
have
to
take
her
away
somewhere
.
<EOS>
You
'll
find
that
she
ca
n't
remain
here
.
<EOS>
And
that
other
woman
will
be
in
prison
before
the
week
's
over
,
I
should
say
,
 
unless
she
runs
away
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
not
much
of
comfort
to
be
obtained
by
any
of
them
from
Lord
George
,
who
was
quite
as
harsh
to
Mrs.
Carbuncle
as
he
had
been
to
Lizzie
Eustace
.
<EOS>
He
remained
in
Hertford
Street
for
an
hour
,
and
then
took
his
leave
,
saying
that
he
thought
that
he
also
should
go
abroad
.
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
think
,
"
he
said
,
"
that
anything
could
have
hurt
my
character
much
;
but
,
upon
my
word
,
between
you
and
Lady
Eustace
,
I
begin
to
find
that
in
every
deep
there
may
be
a
lower
depth
.
<EOS>
All
the
town
has
given
me
credit
for
stealing
her
ladyship
's
necklace
,
and
now
I
shall
be
mixed
up
in
this
mock
marriage
.
<EOS>
I
should
n't
wonder
if
Rooper
were
to
send
his
bill
in
to
me
,
"
 
Mr.
Rooper
was
the
keeper
of
the
hotel
in
Albemarle
Street
,
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
shall
follow
Sir
Griffin
abroad
.
<EOS>
You
have
made
England
too
hot
to
hold
me
.
"
<EOS>
And
so
he
left
them
.
  
<EOS>
The
evening
of
that
day
was
a
terrible
time
to
the
three
ladies
in
Hertford
Street
,
 
and
the
following
day
was
almost
worse
.
<EOS>
Nobody
came
to
see
them
,
and
not
one
of
them
dared
to
speak
of
the
future
.
<EOS>
For
the
third
day
,
the
Wednesday
,
Lady
Eustace
had
made
her
appointment
with
Mr.
Camperdown
,
having
written
to
the
attorney
,
in
compliance
with
the
pressing
advice
of
Major
Mackintosh
,
to
name
an
hour
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Camperdown
had
written
again
,
sending
his
compliments
,
and
saying
that
he
would
receive
Lady
Eustace
at
the
time
fixed
by
her
.
<EOS>
The
prospect
of
this
interview
was
very
bad
,
but
even
this
was
hardly
so
oppressive
as
the
actual
existing
wretchedness
of
that
house
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
whom
Lizzie
had
always
known
as
high
-
spirited
,
bold
,
and
almost
domineering
,
was
altogether
prostrated
by
her
misfortunes
.
<EOS>
She
was
querulous
,
lachrymose
,
and
utterly
despondent
.
<EOS>
From
what
Lizzie
now
learned
,
her
hostess
was
enveloped
in
a
mass
of
debt
which
would
have
been
hopeless
,
even
had
Lucinda
gone
off
as
a
bride
;
but
she
had
been
willing
to
face
all
that
with
the
object
of
establishing
her
niece
.
<EOS>
She
could
have
expected
nothing
from
the
marriage
for
herself
.
<EOS>
She
well
knew
that
Sir
Griffin
would
neither
pay
her
debts
nor
give
her
a
home
nor
lend
her
money
.
<EOS>
But
to
have
married
the
girl
who
was
in
her
charge
would
have
been
in
itself
a
success
,
and
would
have
in
some
sort
repaid
her
for
her
trouble
.
<EOS>
There
would
have
been
something
left
to
show
for
her
expenditure
of
time
and
money
.
<EOS>
But
now
there
was
nothing
around
her
but
failure
and
dismay
.
<EOS>
The
very
servants
in
the
house
seemed
to
know
that
ordinary
respect
was
hardly
demanded
from
them
.
  
<EOS>
As
to
Lucinda
,
Lizzie
felt
,
from
the
very
hour
in
which
she
first
saw
her
on
the
morning
of
the
intended
wedding
,
that
her
mind
was
astray
.
<EOS>
She
insisted
on
passing
the
time
up
in
her
own
room
,
and
always
sat
with
the
Bible
before
her
.
<EOS>
At
every
knock
at
the
door
,
or
ring
at
the
bell
,
she
would
look
round
suspiciously
,
and
once
she
whispered
into
Lizzie
's
ear
that
if
ever
"
he
"
should
come
there
again
<EOS>
she
would
"
give
him
a
kiss
with
a
vengeance
.
<EOS>
"
On
the
Tuesday
,
Lizzie
recommended
Mrs.
Carbuncle
to
get
medical
advice
,
 
and
at
last
they
sent
for
Mr.
Emilius
that
they
might
ask
counsel
of
him
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Emilius
was
full
of
smiles
and
consolation
,
and
still
allowed
his
golden
hopes
as
to
some
Elysian
future
to
crop
out
;
 
but
he
did
acknowledge
at
last
,
in
a
whispered
conference
with
Lady
Eustace
,
that
somebody
ought
to
see
Miss
Roanoke
.
<EOS>
Somebody
did
see
Miss
Roanoke
,
 
and
the
doctor
who
was
thus
appealed
to
shook
his
head
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
Miss
Roanoke
had
better
be
taken
into
the
country
for
a
little
while
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
Lady
Eustace
,
"
said
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
"
now
you
can
be
a
friend
indeed
,
"
 
<EOS>
meaning
,
of
course
,
that
an
invitation
to
Portray
Castle
would
do
more
than
could
anything
else
towards
making
straight
the
crooked
things
of
the
hour
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
when
she
made
the
request
,
of
course
knew
of
Lizzie
's
coming
troubles
;
 
but
let
them
do
what
they
could
to
Lizzie
,
they
could
not
take
away
her
house
.
  
<EOS>
But
Lizzie
felt
at
once
that
this
would
not
suit
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
,
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
know
the
condition
which
I
am
in
myself
!
"
   
<EOS>
Lizzie
Is
Threatened
with
the
Treadmill
 
<EOS>
Early
on
the
Wednesday
morning
,
two
or
three
hours
before
the
time
fixed
for
Lizzie
's
visit
to
Mr.
Camperdown
,
her
cousin
Frank
came
to
call
upon
her
.
<EOS>
She
presumed
him
to
be
altogether
ignorant
of
all
that
Major
Mackintosh
had
known
,
and
therefore
endeavoured
to
receive
him
as
though
her
heart
were
light
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Frank
,
"
she
said
,
"
you
have
heard
of
our
terrible
misfortune
here
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
heard
so
much
,
"
said
he
gravely
,
"
that
I
hardly
know
what
to
believe
and
what
not
to
believe
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
mean
about
Miss
Roanoke
's
marriage
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
yes
;
 
I
have
been
told
that
it
is
broken
off
.
"
  
<EOS>
Then
Lizzie
,
with
affected
eagerness
,
gave
him
a
description
of
the
whole
affair
,
declaring
how
horrible
,
how
tragic
,
the
thing
had
been
from
its
very
commencement
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
remember
,
Frank
,
down
at
Portray
,
they
never
really
cared
for
each
other
?
<EOS>
They
became
engaged
the
very
time
you
were
there
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
forgotten
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
truth
is
,
Lucinda
Roanoke
did
not
understand
what
real
love
means
.
<EOS>
She
had
never
taught
herself
to
comprehend
what
is
the
very
essence
of
love
;
 
and
as
for
Sir
Griffin
Tewett
,
though
he
was
anxious
to
marry
her
,
he
never
had
any
idea
of
love
at
all
.
<EOS>
Did
not
you
always
feel
that
,
Frank
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
sorry
you
have
had
so
much
to
do
with
them
,
Lizzie
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
no
help
for
spilt
milk
,
Frank
;
and
,
as
for
that
,
I
do
n't
suppose
that
Mrs.
Carbuncle
can
do
me
any
harm
.
<EOS>
The
man
is
a
baronet
,
and
the
marriage
would
have
been
respectable
.
<EOS>
Miss
Roanoke
has
been
eccentric
,
and
that
has
been
the
long
and
the
short
of
it
.
<EOS>
What
will
be
done
,
Frank
,
with
all
the
presents
that
were
bought
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
n't
an
idea
.
<EOS>
They
'd
better
be
sold
to
pay
the
bills
.
<EOS>
But
I
came
to
you
,
Lizzie
,
about
another
piece
of
business
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
piece
of
business
?
"
she
asked
,
looking
him
in
the
face
for
a
moment
,
trying
to
be
bold
,
but
trembling
as
she
did
so
.
<EOS>
She
had
believed
him
to
be
ignorant
of
her
story
,
but
she
had
soon
perceived
,
from
his
manner
to
her
,
that
he
knew
it
all
,
 
or
,
at
least
,
that
he
knew
so
much
that
she
would
have
to
tell
him
all
the
rest
.
<EOS>
There
could
be
no
longer
any
secret
with
him
.
<EOS>
Indeed
there
could
be
no
longer
any
secret
with
anybody
.
<EOS>
She
must
be
prepared
to
encounter
a
world
accurately
informed
as
to
every
detail
of
the
business
which
,
for
the
last
three
months
,
had
been
to
her
a
burden
<EOS>
so
oppressive
that
,
at
some
periods
,
she
had
sunk
altogether
under
the
weight
.
<EOS>
She
had
already
endeavoured
to
realise
her
position
,
and
to
make
clear
to
herself
the
condition
of
her
future
life
.
<EOS>
Lord
George
had
talked
to
her
of
perjury
and
prison
,
and
had
tried
to
frighten
her
by
making
the
very
worst
of
her
faults
.
<EOS>
According
to
him
she
would
certainly
be
made
to
pay
for
the
diamonds
,
and
would
be
enabled
to
do
so
by
saving
her
income
during
a
long
term
of
incarceration
.
<EOS>
This
was
a
terrible
prospect
of
things
;
 
and
she
had
almost
believed
in
it
.
<EOS>
Then
the
major
had
come
to
her
.
<EOS>
The
major
,
she
thought
,
was
the
truest
gentleman
she
had
ever
seen
,
and
her
best
friend
.
<EOS>
Ah
;
 
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
wife
and
seven
children
,
there
might
still
have
been
comfort
!
<EOS>
That
which
had
been
perjury
with
Lord
George
,
had
by
the
major
been
so
simply
,
and
yet
so
correctly
,
called
an
incorrect
version
of
facts
!
<EOS>
And
so
it
was
,
 
and
no
more
than
that
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
,
in
defending
herself
to
herself
,
felt
that
,
though
cruel
magistrates
and
hard
-
hearted
lawyers
and
pig
-
headed
jurymen
might
call
her
little
fault
by
the
name
of
perjury
,
it
could
not
be
real
,
wicked
perjury
,
because
the
diamonds
had
been
her
own
.
<EOS>
She
had
defrauded
nobody
,
 
had
wished
to
defraud
nobody
,
 
if
only
the
people
would
have
left
her
alone
.
<EOS>
It
had
suited
her
to
give
 
an
incorrect
version
of
facts
,
because
people
had
troubled
themselves
about
her
affairs
;
and
now
all
this
had
come
upon
her
!
<EOS>
The
major
had
comforted
her
very
greatly
;
but
still
,
 
what
would
the
world
say
?
<EOS>
Even
he
,
kind
and
comfortable
as
he
had
been
,
had
made
her
understand
that
she
must
go
into
court
and
confess
the
incorrectness
of
her
own
version
.
<EOS>
She
believed
every
word
the
major
said
.
<EOS>
Ah
,
there
was
a
man
worthy
to
be
believed
;
 
a
man
of
men
!
<EOS>
They
could
not
take
away
her
income
or
her
castle
.
<EOS>
They
could
not
make
her
pay
for
the
diamonds
.
<EOS>
But
still
,
 
what
would
the
world
say
?
<EOS>
And
what
would
her
lovers
say
?
<EOS>
What
one
of
her
lovers
thought
proper
to
say
,
she
had
already
heard
.
<EOS>
Lord
George
had
spoken
out
,
and
had
made
himself
very
disagreeable
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
,
she
knew
,
would
withdraw
the
renewal
of
his
offer
,
let
her
answer
to
him
be
what
it
might
.
<EOS>
But
what
would
Frank
say
?
<EOS>
And
now
Frank
was
with
her
,
looking
into
her
face
with
severe
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
more
than
ever
convinced
that
the
life
of
a
widow
was
not
suited
for
her
,
and
that
,
among
her
several
lovers
,
she
must
settle
her
wealth
and
her
heart
upon
some
special
lover
.
<EOS>
Neither
her
wealth
nor
her
heart
would
be
in
any
way
injured
by
the
confession
which
she
was
prepared
to
make
.
<EOS>
But
then
men
are
so
timid
,
so
false
,
and
so
blind
!
<EOS>
In
regard
to
Frank
,
whom
she
now
believed
that
she
had
loved
with
all
the
warmth
of
her
young
affections
from
the
first
moment
in
which
she
had
seen
him
after
Sir
Florian
's
death
,
 
she
had
been
at
great
trouble
to
clear
the
way
for
him
.
<EOS>
She
knew
of
his
silly
engagement
to
Lucy
Morris
,
and
was
willing
to
forgive
him
that
offence
.
<EOS>
She
knew
that
he
could
not
marry
Lucy
,
because
of
her
pennilessness
and
his
indebtedness
;
and
therefore
she
had
taken
the
trouble
to
see
Lucy
with
the
view
of
making
things
straight
on
that
side
.
<EOS>
Lucy
had
,
of
course
,
been
rough
with
her
,
and
ill
-
mannered
,
but
Lizzie
thought
that
,
upon
the
whole
,
she
had
succeeded
.
<EOS>
Lucy
was
rough
and
ill
-
mannered
,
but
was
,
at
the
same
time
,
what
the
world
calls
good
,
and
would
hardly
persevere
after
what
had
been
said
to
her
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
was
sure
that
,
a
month
since
,
her
cousin
would
have
yielded
himself
to
her
willingly
,
if
he
could
only
have
freed
himself
from
Lucy
Morris
.
<EOS>
But
now
,
just
in
this
very
nick
of
time
,
which
was
so
momentous
to
her
,
the
police
had
succeeded
in
unravelling
her
secret
,
and
there
sat
Frank
,
looking
at
her
with
stern
,
ill
-
natured
eyes
,
like
an
enemy
rather
than
a
lover
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
piece
of
business
?
"
she
asked
,
in
answer
to
his
question
.
<EOS>
She
must
be
bold
,
 
if
she
could
.
<EOS>
She
must
brazen
it
out
with
him
,
if
only
she
could
be
strong
enough
to
put
on
her
brass
in
his
presence
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
so
stupidly
chivalrous
in
believing
all
her
stories
about
the
robbery
when
nobody
else
had
quite
believed
them
,
that
she
felt
that
she
had
before
her
a
task
that
was
very
disagreeable
and
very
difficult
.
<EOS>
She
looked
up
at
him
,
struggling
to
be
bold
,
and
then
her
glance
sank
before
his
gaze
and
fell
upon
the
floor
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
at
all
wish
to
pry
into
your
secrets
,
"
he
said
.
  
<EOS>
Secrets
from
him
!
<EOS>
Some
such
exclamation
was
on
her
lips
,
when
she
remembered
that
her
special
business
,
at
the
present
moment
,
was
to
acknowledge
a
secret
which
had
been
kept
from
him
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
unkind
of
you
to
speak
to
me
in
that
way
,
"
she
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
quite
in
earnest
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
wish
to
pry
into
your
secrets
.
<EOS>
But
I
hear
rumours
which
seem
to
be
substantiated
;
and
though
,
of
course
,
I
could
stay
away
from
you
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
Oh
,
 
whatever
happens
,
pray
,
pray
do
not
stay
away
from
me
.
<EOS>
Where
am
I
to
look
for
advice
if
you
stay
away
from
me
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
all
very
well
,
Lizzie
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
Frank
!
<EOS>
if
you
desert
me
,
I
am
undone
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
,
of
course
,
true
that
some
of
the
police
have
been
with
you
lately
?
"
  
"
Major
Mackintosh
was
here
,
about
the
end
of
last
week
,
 
a
most
kind
man
,
altogether
a
gentleman
,
and
I
was
so
glad
to
see
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
made
him
come
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
made
him
come
?
"
How
should
she
tell
her
story
?
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
he
came
,
of
course
,
about
the
robbery
.
<EOS>
They
have
found
out
everything
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
jeweller
,
Benjamin
,
who
concocted
it
all
.
<EOS>
That
horrid
sly
girl
<EOS>
I
had
,
Patience
Crabstick
,
put
him
up
to
it
.
<EOS>
And
there
were
two
regular
housebreakers
.
<EOS>
They
have
found
it
all
out
at
last
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
So
I
hear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
Major
Mackintosh
came
to
tell
me
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
the
diamonds
are
gone
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
yes
;
 
those
weary
,
weary
diamonds
.
<EOS>
Do
you
know
,
Frank
,
that
,
though
they
were
my
own
,
as
much
as
the
coat
you
wear
is
your
own
,
I
am
glad
they
are
gone
.
<EOS>
I
am
glad
that
the
police
have
not
found
them
.
<EOS>
They
tormented
me
so
that
I
hated
them
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
remember
that
I
told
you
how
I
longed
to
throw
them
into
the
sea
,
and
to
be
rid
of
them
for
ever
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
,
of
course
,
was
a
joke
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
no
joke
,
Frank
.
<EOS>
It
was
solemn
,
serious
truth
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
I
want
to
know
is
,
 
where
were
they
stolen
?
"
  
<EOS>
That
,
of
course
,
was
the
question
which
hitherto
Lizzie
Eustace
had
answered
by
an
incorrect
version
of
facts
,
and
now
she
must
give
the
true
version
.
<EOS>
She
tried
to
put
a
bold
face
upon
it
,
but
it
was
very
difficult
.
<EOS>
A
face
bold
with
brass
<EOS>
she
could
not
assume
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
a
little
bit
of
acting
might
serve
her
turn
,
and
a
face
that
should
be
tender
rather
than
bold
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
Frank
!
"
she
exclaimed
,
bursting
out
into
tears
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
always
supposed
that
they
were
taken
at
Carlisle
,
"
said
Frank
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
fell
on
her
knees
,
at
his
feet
,
with
her
hands
clasped
together
,
and
her
one
long
lock
of
hair
hanging
down
so
as
to
touch
his
arm
.
<EOS>
Her
eyes
were
bright
with
tears
,
but
were
not
,
as
yet
,
wet
and
red
with
weeping
.
<EOS>
Was
not
this
confession
enough
?
<EOS>
Was
he
so
hard
-
hearted
as
to
make
her
tell
her
own
disgrace
in
spoken
words
?
<EOS>
Of
course
he
knew
,
well
enough
,
now
,
when
the
diamonds
had
been
stolen
.
<EOS>
If
he
were
possessed
of
any
tenderness
,
any
tact
,
any
manliness
,
he
would
go
on
,
presuming
that
question
to
have
been
answered
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
quite
understand
it
all
,
"
he
said
,
laying
his
hand
softly
upon
her
shoulder
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
led
to
make
so
many
statements
to
other
people
,
which
now
seem
to
have
been
 
incorrect
!
<EOS>
It
was
only
the
box
that
was
taken
at
Carlisle
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Only
the
box
.
<EOS>
"
She
could
answer
that
question
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
the
thieves
thought
that
the
diamonds
were
in
the
box
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
so
.
<EOS>
But
,
oh
,
Frank
!
<EOS>
do
n't
cross
-
question
me
about
it
.
<EOS>
If
you
could
know
what
I
have
suffered
,
you
would
not
punish
me
any
more
.
<EOS>
I
have
got
to
go
to
Mr.
Camperdown
's
this
very
day
.
<EOS>
I
offered
to
do
that
at
once
,
and
I
sha'n't
have
strength
to
go
through
it
if
you
are
not
kind
to
me
now
.
<EOS>
Dear
,
dear
Frank
,
 
do
be
kind
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
And
he
was
kind
to
her
.
<EOS>
He
lifted
her
up
to
the
sofa
and
did
not
ask
her
another
question
about
the
necklace
.
<EOS>
Of
course
she
had
lied
to
him
and
to
all
the
world
.
<EOS>
From
the
very
commencement
of
his
intimacy
with
her
,
he
had
known
that
she
was
a
liar
,
and
what
else
could
he
have
expected
but
lies
?
<EOS>
As
it
happened
,
this
particular
lie
had
been
very
big
,
very
efficacious
,
and
the
cause
of
boundless
troubles
.
<EOS>
It
had
been
wholly
unnecessary
,
and
,
from
the
first
,
though
injurious
to
many
,
more
injurious
to
her
than
to
any
other
.
<EOS>
He
himself
had
been
injured
,
but
it
seemed
to
him
now
that
she
had
absolutely
ruined
herself
.
<EOS>
And
all
this
had
been
done
for
nothing
,
 
had
been
done
,
as
he
thought
,
that
Mr.
Camperdown
might
be
kept
in
the
dark
,
whereas
all
the
light
in
the
world
would
have
assisted
Mr.
Camperdown
nothing
.
<EOS>
He
brought
to
mind
,
as
he
stood
over
her
,
all
those
scenes
which
she
had
so
successfully
performed
in
his
presence
since
she
had
come
to
London
,
 
scenes
in
which
the
robbery
in
Carlisle
had
been
discussed
between
them
.
<EOS>
She
had
on
these
occasions
freely
expressed
her
opinion
about
the
necklace
,
saying
,
in
a
low
whisper
,
with
a
pretty
little
shrug
of
her
shoulders
,
that
she
presumed
it
to
be
impossible
that
Lord
George
should
have
been
concerned
in
the
robbery
.
<EOS>
Frank
had
felt
,
as
she
said
so
,
that
some
suspicion
was
intended
by
her
to
be
attached
to
Lord
George
.
<EOS>
She
had
wondered
whether
Mr.
Camperdown
had
known
anything
about
it
.
<EOS>
She
had
hoped
that
Lord
Fawn
would
now
be
satisfied
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
quite
convinced
that
Mr.
Benjamin
had
the
diamonds
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
indignant
that
the
police
had
not
traced
the
property
.
<EOS>
She
had
asked
in
another
whisper
,
 
a
very
low
whisper
indeed
,
 
whether
it
was
possible
that
Mrs.
Carbuncle
should
know
more
about
it
than
she
was
pleased
to
tell
?
<EOS>
And
all
the
while
the
necklace
had
been
lying
in
her
own
desk
,
and
she
had
put
it
there
with
her
own
hands
!
  
<EOS>
It
was
marvellous
to
him
that
the
woman
could
have
been
so
false
and
have
sustained
her
falsehood
so
well
.
<EOS>
And
this
was
his
cousin
,
his
well
-
beloved
,
 
as
a
cousin
,
certainly
well
-
beloved
;
and
there
had
,
doubtless
,
been
times
in
which
he
had
thought
that
he
would
make
her
his
wife
!
<EOS>
He
could
not
but
smile
as
he
stood
looking
at
her
,
contemplating
all
the
confusion
which
she
had
caused
,
and
thinking
how
very
little
the
disclosure
of
her
iniquity
seemed
to
confound
herself
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
Frank
,
do
not
laugh
at
me
,
"
she
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
laughing
,
Lizzie
;
I
am
only
wondering
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
now
,
Frank
,
what
had
I
better
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
;
 
that
is
difficult
;
is
it
not
?
<EOS>
You
see
I
hardly
know
all
the
truth
yet
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
want
to
know
more
,
 
but
how
can
I
advise
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
thought
you
knew
everything
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
suppose
anybody
can
do
anything
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Major
Mackintosh
says
that
nobody
can
.
<EOS>
He
quite
understands
that
they
were
my
own
property
,
and
that
I
had
a
right
to
keep
them
in
my
desk
if
I
pleased
.
<EOS>
Why
was
I
to
tell
everybody
where
they
were
?
<EOS>
Of
course
I
was
foolish
,
and
now
they
are
lost
.
<EOS>
It
is
I
that
have
suffered
.
<EOS>
Major
Mackintosh
quite
understands
that
,
and
says
that
nobody
can
do
anything
to
me
;
 
only
I
must
go
to
Mr.
Camperdown
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
You
will
have
to
be
examined
again
before
a
magistrate
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
 
I
suppose
I
must
be
examined
.
<EOS>
You
will
go
with
me
,
Frank
,
 
wo
n't
you
?
"
<EOS>
He
winced
,
and
made
no
immediate
reply
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
mean
to
Mr.
Camperdown
,
but
before
the
magistrate
.
<EOS>
Will
it
be
in
a
court
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
gentleman
came
here
before
.
<EOS>
Could
n't
he
come
here
again
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Then
he
explained
to
her
the
difference
of
her
present
position
,
and
in
doing
so
he
did
say
something
of
her
iniquity
.
<EOS>
He
made
her
understand
that
the
magistrate
had
gone
out
of
his
way
at
the
last
inquiry
,
believing
her
to
be
a
lady
who
had
been
grievously
wronged
,
and
one
,
therefore
,
to
whom
much
consideration
was
due
.
<EOS>
"
And
I
have
been
grievously
wronged
,
"
said
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
But
now
she
would
be
required
to
tell
the
truth
in
opposition
to
the
false
evidence
which
she
had
formerly
given
;
and
she
would
herself
be
exempted
from
prosecution
for
perjury
only
on
the
ground
that
she
would
be
called
on
to
criminate
herself
in
giving
evidence
against
criminals
whose
crimes
had
been
deeper
than
her
own
.
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
they
ca
n't
quite
eat
me
,
"
she
said
,
smiling
through
her
tears
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
 
they
wo
n't
eat
you
,
"
he
replied
gravely
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
will
go
with
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
 
I
suppose
I
had
better
do
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
;
 
that
will
be
so
nice
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
idea
of
the
scene
at
the
police
-
court
was
not
at
all
"
nice
"
to
Frank
Greystock
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
not
mind
what
they
say
to
me
as
long
as
you
are
by
my
side
.
<EOS>
Everybody
will
know
that
they
were
my
own
,
 
wo
n't
they
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
there
will
be
the
trial
afterwards
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Another
trial
?
"
<EOS>
Then
he
explained
to
her
the
course
of
affairs
,
 
that
the
men
might
not
improbably
be
tried
at
Carlisle
for
stealing
the
box
,
and
again
in
London
for
stealing
the
diamonds
,
 
that
two
distinct
acts
of
burglary
had
been
committed
,
and
that
her
evidence
would
be
required
on
both
occasions
.
<EOS>
He
told
her
also
that
her
attendance
before
the
magistrate
on
Friday
would
only
be
a
preliminary
ceremony
,
and
that
,
before
the
thing
was
over
she
would
,
doubtless
,
be
doomed
to
bear
a
great
deal
of
annoyance
,
and
to
answer
very
many
disagreeable
questions
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
care
for
nothing
if
you
will
only
be
at
my
side
,
"
she
exclaimed
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
very
urgent
with
her
to
go
to
Scotland
as
soon
as
her
examination
before
the
magistrates
should
be
over
,
and
was
much
astonished
at
the
excuse
she
made
for
not
doing
so
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
had
borrowed
all
her
ready
money
;
but
as
she
was
now
in
Mrs.
Carbuncle
's
house
,
she
could
repay
herself
a
portion
of
the
loan
by
remaining
there
and
eating
it
out
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
exactly
say
how
much
Mrs.
Carbuncle
had
borrowed
,
but
she
left
an
impression
on
Frank
's
mind
that
it
was
about
ten
times
the
actual
sum
.
<EOS>
With
this
excuse
he
was
not
satisfied
,
and
told
her
that
she
must
go
to
Scotland
,
if
only
for
the
sake
of
escaping
from
the
Carbuncle
connexion
.
<EOS>
She
promised
to
obey
him
if
he
would
be
her
convoy
.
<EOS>
The
Easter
holidays
were
just
now
at
hand
,
and
he
could
not
refuse
on
the
plea
of
time
.
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Frank
,
do
not
refuse
me
this
;
 
only
think
how
terribly
forlorn
is
my
position
!
"
<EOS>
He
did
not
refuse
,
but
he
did
not
quite
promise
.
<EOS>
He
was
still
tender
-
hearted
towards
her
in
spite
of
her
enormities
.
<EOS>
One
iniquity
,
 
perhaps
her
worst
iniquity
,
he
did
not
yet
know
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
as
yet
heard
of
her
disinterested
appeal
to
Lucy
Morris
.
  
<EOS>
When
he
left
her
she
was
almost
joyous
for
a
few
minutes
;
 
till
the
thought
of
her
coming
interview
with
Mr.
Camperdown
again
overshadowed
her
.
<EOS>
She
had
dreaded
two
things
chiefly
,
 
her
first
interview
with
her
cousin
Frank
after
he
should
have
learned
the
truth
,
and
those
perils
in
regard
to
perjury
with
which
Lord
George
had
threatened
her
.
<EOS>
Both
these
bugbears
had
now
vanished
.
<EOS>
That
dear
man
,
the
major
,
had
told
her
that
there
would
be
no
such
perils
,
and
her
cousin
Frank
had
not
seemed
to
think
so
very
much
of
her
lies
and
treachery
!
<EOS>
He
had
still
been
affectionate
with
her
;
he
would
support
her
before
the
magistrate
,
and
would
travel
with
her
to
Scotland
.
<EOS>
And
after
that
who
could
tell
what
might
come
next
?
<EOS>
How
foolish
she
had
been
to
trouble
herself
as
she
had
done
,
 
almost
to
choke
herself
with
an
agony
of
fear
,
because
she
had
feared
detection
.
<EOS>
Now
she
was
detected
;
 
and
what
had
come
of
it
?
<EOS>
That
great
officer
of
justice
,
Major
Mackintosh
,
had
been
almost
more
than
civil
to
her
;
and
her
dear
cousin
Frank
was
still
a
cousin
,
 
dear
as
ever
.
<EOS>
People
,
after
all
,
did
not
think
so
very
much
of
perjury
,
 
of
perjury
such
as
hers
,
committed
in
regard
to
one
's
own
property
.
<EOS>
It
was
that
odious
Lord
George
who
had
frightened
her
,
instead
of
comforting
,
as
he
would
have
done
<EOS>
had
there
been
a
spark
of
the
true
Corsair
poetry
about
him
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
feel
comfortably
confident
as
to
what
might
be
said
of
her
by
Lady
Glencora
and
the
Duke
of
Omnium
,
but
she
was
almost
inclined
to
think
that
Lady
Glencora
would
support
her
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
was
no
poor
,
mealy
-
mouthed
thing
,
but
a
woman
of
the
world
who
understood
what
was
what
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
no
doubt
wished
that
the
trials
and
examinations
were
over
;
 
but
her
money
was
safe
.
<EOS>
They
could
not
take
away
Portray
,
nor
could
they
rob
her
of
four
thousand
a
year
.
<EOS>
As
for
the
rest
,
she
could
live
it
down
.
  
<EOS>
She
had
ordered
the
carriage
to
take
her
to
Mr.
Camperdown
's
chambers
,
and
now
she
dressed
herself
for
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
He
should
not
be
made
to
think
,
at
any
rate
by
her
outside
appearance
,
that
she
was
ashamed
of
herself
.
<EOS>
But
before
she
started
she
had
just
a
word
with
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
shall
go
down
to
Scotland
on
Saturday
,
"
she
said
,
proclaiming
her
news
not
in
the
most
gracious
manner
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
if
they
let
you
go
,
"
said
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
Who
is
to
prevent
me
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
police
.
<EOS>
I
know
all
about
it
,
Lady
Eustace
,
and
you
need
not
look
like
that
.
<EOS>
Lord
George
informs
me
that
you
will
probably
 
be
locked
up
to
-
day
or
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Lord
George
is
a
story
-
teller
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
believe
he
ever
said
so
.
<EOS>
And
if
he
did
,
he
knows
nothing
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
ought
to
know
,
considering
all
that
you
have
made
him
suffer
.
<EOS>
That
you
should
have
gone
on
,
with
the
necklace
in
your
own
box
all
the
time
,
letting
people
think
that
he
had
taken
it
,
and
accepting
his
attentions
all
the
while
,
is
what
I
can
not
understand
!
<EOS>
And
however
you
were
able
to
look
those
people
at
Carlisle
in
the
face
,
passes
me
!
<EOS>
Of
course
,
Lady
Eustace
,
you
ca
n't
stay
here
after
what
has
occurred
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
stay
just
as
long
as
I
like
,
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Poor
dear
Lucinda
!
<EOS>
I
do
not
wonder
that
she
should
be
driven
beyond
herself
by
so
horrible
a
story
.
<EOS>
The
feeling
that
she
has
been
living
all
this
time
in
the
same
house
with
a
woman
who
had
deceived
all
the
police
,
 
all
the
police
,
 
has
been
too
much
for
her
.
<EOS>
I
know
it
has
been
almost
too
much
for
me
.
"
<EOS>
And
yet
,
as
Lizzie
at
once
understood
,
Mrs.
Carbuncle
knew
nothing
now
which
she
had
not
known
when
she
made
her
petition
to
be
taken
to
Portray
.
<EOS>
And
this
was
the
woman
,
too
,
who
had
borrowed
her
money
last
week
,
whom
she
had
entertained
for
months
at
Portray
,
and
who
had
pretended
to
be
her
bosom
-
friend
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
quite
right
in
getting
off
to
Scotland
as
soon
as
possible
,
 
if
they
will
let
you
go
,
"
continued
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
<EOS>
"
Of
course
you
could
not
stay
here
.
<EOS>
Up
to
Friday
night
it
can
be
permitted
;
but
the
servants
had
better
wait
upon
you
in
your
own
rooms
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
dare
you
talk
to
me
in
that
way
?
<EOS>
"
screamed
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
"
When
a
woman
has
committed
perjury
,
"
said
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
holding
up
both
her
hands
in
awe
and
grief
,
<EOS>
"
nothing
too
bad
can
possibly
be
said
to
her
.
<EOS>
You
are
amenable
to
the
outraged
laws
of
the
country
,
and
it
is
my
belief
that
they
can
keep
you
upon
the
treadmill
and
bread
and
water
for
months
and
months
,
 
if
not
for
years
.
"
<EOS>
Having
pronounced
this
terrible
sentence
,
Mrs.
Carbuncle
stalked
out
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
"
That
they
can
sequester
your
property
for
your
creditors
,
I
know
,
"
she
said
,
returning
for
a
moment
and
putting
her
head
within
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
The
carriage
was
ready
,
and
it
was
time
for
Lizzie
to
start
if
she
intended
to
keep
her
appointment
with
Mr.
Camperdown
.
<EOS>
She
was
much
flustered
and
weakened
by
Mrs.
Carbuncle
's
ill
-
usage
,
and
had
difficulty
in
restraining
herself
from
tears
.
<EOS>
And
yet
what
the
woman
had
said
was
false
from
beginning
to
end
.
<EOS>
The
maid
,
who
was
the
successor
of
Patience
Crabstick
,
was
to
accompany
her
;
and
,
as
she
passed
through
the
hall
,
she
so
far
recovered
herself
as
to
be
able
to
conceal
her
dismay
from
the
servants
.
   
<EOS>
Lizzie
Triumphs
 
Reports
had
,
of
course
,
reached
Mr.
Camperdown
of
the
true
story
of
the
Eustace
diamonds
.
<EOS>
He
had
learned
that
the
Jew
jeweller
had
made
a
determined
set
at
them
,
having
in
the
first
place
hired
housebreakers
to
steal
them
at
Carlisle
,
and
having
again
hired
the
same
housebreakers
to
steal
them
from
the
house
in
Hertford
Street
,
as
soon
as
he
knew
that
Lady
Eustace
had
herself
secreted
them
.
<EOS>
By
degrees
this
information
had
reached
him
,
 
but
not
in
a
manner
to
induce
him
to
declare
himself
satisfied
with
the
truth
.
<EOS>
But
now
Lady
Eustace
was
coming
to
him
,
 
as
he
presumed
,
to
confess
everything
.
  
<EOS>
When
he
first
heard
that
the
diamonds
had
been
stolen
at
Carlisle
,
he
was
eager
with
Mr.
Eustace
in
contending
that
the
widow
's
liability
in
regard
to
the
property
was
not
at
all
the
less
because
she
had
managed
to
lose
it
through
her
own
pig
-
headed
obstinacy
.
<EOS>
He
consulted
his
trusted
friend
,
Mr.
Dove
,
on
the
occasion
,
making
out
another
case
for
the
barrister
,
and
Mr.
Dove
had
opined
that
,
if
it
could
be
first
proved
that
the
diamonds
were
the
property
of
the
estate
and
not
of
Lady
Eustace
,
and
afterwards
proved
that
they
had
been
stolen
through
her
laches
,
 
then
could
the
Eustace
estate
recover
the
value
from
her
estate
.
<EOS>
As
she
had
carried
the
diamonds
about
with
her
in
an
absurd
manner
,
her
responsibility
might
probably
be
established
;
 
but
the
non
-
existence
of
ownership
by
her
must
be
first
declared
by
a
Vice
-
Chancellor
,
 
with
probability
of
appeal
to
the
Lords
Justices
and
to
the
House
of
Lords
.
<EOS>
A
bill
in
Chancery
must
be
filed
,
in
the
first
place
,
to
have
the
question
of
ownership
settled
;
and
then
,
should
the
estate
be
at
length
declared
the
owner
,
restitution
of
the
property
which
had
been
lost
through
the
lady
's
fault
must
be
sought
at
Common
Law
.
  
<EOS>
That
had
been
the
opinion
of
the
Turtle
Dove
,
and
Mr.
Camperdown
had
at
once
submitted
to
the
law
of
his
great
legal
mentor
.
<EOS>
But
John
Eustace
had
positively
declared
when
he
heard
it
that
no
more
money
should
be
thrown
away
in
looking
after
property
which
would
require
two
lawsuits
to
establish
,
and
which
,
when
established
,
might
not
be
recovered
.
<EOS>
"
How
can
we
make
her
pay
ten
thousand
pounds
?
<EOS>
She
might
die
first
,
"
said
John
Eustace
;
 
and
Mr.
Camperdown
had
been
forced
to
yield
.
<EOS>
Then
came
the
second
robbery
,
and
gradually
there
was
spread
about
a
report
that
the
diamonds
had
been
in
Hertford
Street
all
the
time
;
 
that
they
had
not
been
taken
at
Carlisle
,
but
certainly
had
been
stolen
at
last
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Camperdown
was
again
in
a
fever
,
and
again
had
recourse
to
Mr.
Dove
and
to
John
Eustace
.
<EOS>
He
learned
from
the
police
all
that
they
would
tell
him
,
and
now
the
whole
truth
was
to
be
divulged
to
him
by
the
chief
culprit
herself
.
<EOS>
For
,
to
the
mind
of
Mr.
Camperdown
the
two
housebreakers
,
and
Patience
Crabstick
,
 
and
even
Mr.
Benjamin
himself
,
were
white
as
snow
compared
with
the
blackness
of
Lady
Eustace
.
<EOS>
In
his
estimation
no
punishment
could
be
too
great
for
her
,
 
and
yet
he
began
to
understand
that
she
would
escape
scot
-
free
!
<EOS>
Her
evidence
would
be
needed
to
convict
the
thieves
,
and
she
could
not
be
prosecuted
for
perjury
when
once
she
had
been
asked
for
her
evidence
.
<EOS>
"
After
all
,
she
has
only
told
a
fib
about
her
own
property
,
"
said
the
Turtle
Dove
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
About
property
not
her
own
,
"
replied
Mr.
Camperdown
stoutly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Her
own
,
 
till
the
contrary
shall
have
been
proved
;
her
own
,
for
all
purposes
of
defence
before
a
jury
,
if
she
were
prosecuted
now
.
<EOS>
Were
she
tried
for
the
perjury
,
your
attempt
to
obtain
possession
of
the
diamonds
would
be
all
so
much
in
her
favour
.
"
<EOS>
With
infinite
regrets
,
Mr.
Camperdown
began
to
perceive
that
nothing
could
be
done
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
But
she
was
to
come
to
him
and
let
him
know
,
from
her
own
lips
<EOS>
,
facts
of
which
nothing
more
than
rumour
had
yet
reached
him
.
<EOS>
He
had
commenced
his
bill
in
Chancery
,
and
had
hitherto
stayed
proceedings
simply
because
it
had
been
reported
,
 
falsely
,
as
it
now
appeared
,
 
that
the
diamonds
had
been
stolen
at
Carlisle
.
<EOS>
Major
Mackintosh
,
in
his
desire
to
use
Lizzie
's
evidence
against
the
thieves
,
had
recommended
her
to
tell
the
whole
truth
openly
to
those
who
claimed
the
property
on
behalf
of
her
husband
's
estate
;
and
now
,
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
,
this
odious
woman
was
to
visit
him
in
his
own
chambers
.
  
<EOS>
He
did
not
think
it
expedient
to
receive
her
alone
.
<EOS>
He
consulted
his
mentor
,
Mr.
Dove
,
and
his
client
,
John
Eustace
,
and
the
latter
consented
to
be
present
.
<EOS>
It
was
suggested
to
Mr.
Dove
that
he
might
,
on
so
peculiar
an
occasion
as
this
,
venture
to
depart
from
the
established
rule
,
and
visit
the
attorney
on
his
own
quarter
-
deck
;
but
he
smiled
,
and
explained
that
,
though
he
was
altogether
superior
to
any
such
prejudice
as
that
,
and
would
not
object
at
all
to
call
on
his
friend
,
Mr.
Camperdown
,
could
any
good
effect
arise
from
his
doing
so
<EOS>
,
he
considered
that
,
were
he
to
be
present
on
this
occasion
,
he
would
simply
assist
in
embarrassing
the
poor
lady
.
  
<EOS>
On
this
very
morning
,
while
Mrs.
Carbuncle
was
abusing
Lizzie
in
Hertford
Street
,
John
Eustace
and
Mr.
Camperdown
were
in
Mr.
Dove
's
chambers
,
whither
they
had
gone
to
tell
him
of
the
coming
interview
.
<EOS>
The
Turtle
Dove
was
sitting
back
in
his
chair
,
with
his
head
leaning
forward
as
though
it
were
going
to
drop
from
his
neck
,
and
the
two
visitors
were
listening
to
his
words
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Be
merciful
,
I
should
say
,
"
suggested
the
barrister
.
<EOS>
John
Eustace
was
clearly
of
opinion
that
they
ought
to
be
merciful
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Camperdown
did
not
look
merciful
.
<EOS>
"
What
can
you
get
by
harassing
the
poor
,
weak
,
ignorant
creature
?
"
continued
Mr.
Dove
.
<EOS>
"
She
has
hankered
after
her
bauble
,
and
has
told
falsehoods
in
her
efforts
to
keep
it
.
<EOS>
Have
you
never
heard
of
older
persons
,
and
more
learned
persons
,
and
persons
nearer
to
ourselves
,
who
have
done
the
same
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
At
that
moment
there
was
presumed
to
be
great
rivalry
,
not
unaccompanied
by
intrigue
,
among
certain
leaders
of
the
learned
profession
with
reference
to
various
positions
of
high
honour
and
emolument
,
vacant
or
expected
to
be
vacant
.
<EOS>
A
Lord
Chancellor
was
about
to
resign
,
and
a
Lord
Justice
had
died
.
<EOS>
Whether
a
somewhat
unpopular
Attorney
-
General
should
be
forced
to
satisfy
himself
with
the
one
place
,
or
allowed
to
wait
for
the
other
,
had
been
debated
in
all
the
newspapers
.
<EOS>
It
was
agreed
that
there
was
a
middle
course
in
reference
to
a
certain
second
-
class
Chief
-
Justiceship
,
 
only
that
the
present
second
-
class
Chief
-
Justice
objected
to
shelving
himself
.
<EOS>
There
existed
considerable
jealousy
,
and
some
statements
had
been
made
which
were
not
,
perhaps
,
strictly
founded
on
fact
.
<EOS>
It
was
understood
,
both
by
the
attorney
and
by
the
Member
of
Parliament
,
that
the
Turtle
Dove
was
referring
to
these
circumstances
when
he
spoke
of
baubles
and
falsehoods
,
and
of
learned
persons
near
to
themselves
.
<EOS>
He
himself
had
hankered
after
no
bauble
,
 
but
,
as
is
the
case
with
many
men
and
women
who
are
free
from
such
hankerings
,
he
was
hardly
free
from
that
dash
of
malice
which
the
possession
of
such
things
in
the
hands
of
others
is
so
prone
to
excite
.
<EOS>
"
Spare
her
,
"
said
Mr.
Dove
.
<EOS>
"
There
is
no
longer
any
material
question
as
to
the
property
,
which
seems
to
be
gone
irrecoverably
.
<EOS>
It
is
,
upon
the
whole
,
well
for
the
world
,
that
property
so
fictitious
as
diamonds
should
be
subject
to
the
risk
of
such
annihilation
.
<EOS>
As
far
as
we
are
concerned
,
the
property
is
annihilated
,
and
I
would
not
harass
the
poor
,
ignorant
young
creature
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
As
Eustace
and
the
attorney
walked
across
from
the
Old
to
the
New
Square
,
the
former
declared
that
he
quite
agreed
with
Mr.
Dove
.
<EOS>
"
In
the
first
place
,
Mr.
Camperdown
,
she
is
my
brother
's
widow
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Camperdown
with
sorrow
admitted
the
fact
.
"
<EOS>
And
she
is
the
mother
of
the
head
of
our
family
.
<EOS>
It
should
not
be
for
us
to
degrade
her
;
 
but
rather
to
protect
her
from
degradation
,
if
that
be
possible
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
heartily
wish
she
had
got
her
merits
before
your
poor
brother
ever
saw
her
,
"
said
Mr.
Camperdown
.
  
<EOS>
Lizzie
,
in
her
fears
,
had
been
very
punctual
;
and
when
the
two
gentlemen
reached
the
door
leading
up
to
Mr.
Camperdown
's
chambers
,
the
carriage
was
already
standing
there
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
had
come
up
the
stairs
,
and
had
been
delighted
at
hearing
that
Mr.
Camperdown
was
out
,
and
would
be
back
in
a
moment
.
<EOS>
She
instantly
resolved
that
it
did
not
become
her
to
wait
.
<EOS>
She
had
kept
her
appointment
,
had
not
found
Mr.
Camperdown
at
home
,
and
would
be
off
as
fast
as
her
carriage
-
wheels
could
take
her
.
<EOS>
But
,
unfortunately
,
while
with
a
gentle
murmur
she
was
explaining
to
the
clerk
how
impossible
it
was
that
she
should
wait
for
a
lawyer
who
did
not
keep
his
own
appointment
,
John
Eustace
and
Mr.
Camperdown
appeared
upon
the
landing
,
and
she
was
at
once
convoyed
into
the
attorney
's
particular
room
.
  
<EOS>
Lizzie
,
who
always
dressed
well
,
was
now
attired
as
became
a
lady
of
rank
,
who
had
four
thousand
a
year
,
and
was
the
intimate
friend
of
Lady
Glencora
Palliser
.
<EOS>
When
last
she
saw
Mr.
Camperdown
she
had
been
arrayed
for
a
long
,
dusty
summer
journey
down
to
Scotland
,
and
neither
by
her
outside
garniture
nor
by
her
manner
<EOS>
had
she
then
been
able
to
exact
much
admiration
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
taken
by
surprise
in
the
street
,
and
was
frightened
.
<EOS>
Now
,
in
difficulty
though
she
was
,
she
resolved
that
she
would
hold
up
her
head
and
be
very
brave
.
<EOS>
She
was
a
little
taken
aback
<EOS>
when
she
saw
her
brother
-
in
-
law
,
but
she
strove
hard
to
carry
herself
with
confidence
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
,
John
,
"
she
said
,
"
I
did
not
expect
to
find
you
with
Mr.
Camperdown
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
thought
it
best
that
I
should
be
here
,
 
as
a
friend
,
"
he
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
makes
it
much
pleasanter
for
me
,
of
course
,
"
said
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
quite
sure
that
Mr.
Camperdown
will
allow
me
to
regard
him
as
a
friend
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
never
had
any
reason
to
regard
me
as
your
enemy
,
Lady
Eustace
,
"
said
Mr.
Camperdown
.
<EOS>
"
Will
you
take
a
seat
?
<EOS>
I
understand
that
you
wish
to
state
the
circumstances
under
which
the
Eustace
family
diamonds
were
stolen
while
they
were
in
your
hands
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
own
diamonds
,
Mr.
Camperdown
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
admit
that
for
a
moment
,
my
lady
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
does
it
signify
?
"
said
Eustace
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
wretched
stones
are
gone
for
ever
;
and
whether
they
were
of
right
the
property
of
my
sister
-
in
-
law
,
or
of
her
son
,
can
not
matter
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Camperdown
was
irritated
,
and
shook
his
head
.
<EOS>
It
cut
him
to
the
heart
that
everybody
should
take
the
part
of
the
wicked
,
fraudulent
woman
who
had
caused
him
such
infinite
trouble
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
saw
her
opportunity
and
was
bolder
than
ever
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
never
get
me
to
acknowledge
that
they
were
not
my
own
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
My
husband
gave
them
to
me
,
and
I
know
that
they
were
my
own
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
have
been
stolen
,
at
any
rate
,
"
said
the
lawyer
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
 
they
have
been
stolen
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
now
will
you
tell
us
how
?
"
  
<EOS>
Lizzie
looked
round
upon
her
brother
-
in
-
law
and
sighed
.
<EOS>
She
had
never
yet
told
the
story
in
all
its
nakedness
,
although
it
had
been
three
or
four
times
extracted
from
her
by
admission
.
<EOS>
She
paused
,
hoping
that
questions
might
be
asked
her
which
she
could
answer
by
easy
monosyllables
,
but
not
a
word
was
uttered
to
help
her
.
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
you
know
all
about
it
,
"
she
said
at
last
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
nothing
about
it
,
"
said
Mr.
Camperdown
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
heard
that
your
jewel
-
case
was
taken
out
of
your
room
at
Carlisle
and
broken
open
,
"
said
Eustace
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
it
was
.
<EOS>
They
broke
into
my
room
in
the
dead
of
night
,
when
I
was
in
bed
,
fast
asleep
,
and
took
the
case
away
.
<EOS>
When
the
morning
came
,
everybody
rushed
into
my
room
,
and
I
was
so
frightened
that
I
did
not
know
what
I
was
doing
.
<EOS>
How
would
your
daughter
bear
it
,
if
two
men
cut
away
the
locks
and
got
into
her
bedroom
when
she
was
asleep
?
<EOS>
You
do
n't
think
about
that
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
where
was
the
necklace
?
"
asked
Eustace
.
  
<EOS>
Lizzie
remembered
that
her
friend
the
major
had
specially
advised
her
to
tell
the
whole
truth
to
Mr.
Camperdown
,
 
suggesting
that
by
doing
so
she
would
go
far
towards
saving
herself
from
any
prosecution
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
under
my
pillow
,
"
she
whispered
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
why
did
you
not
tell
the
magistrate
that
it
had
been
under
your
pillow
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Camperdown
's
voice
,
as
he
put
to
her
this
vital
question
,
was
severe
,
and
almost
justified
the
little
burst
of
sobs
which
came
forth
as
a
prelude
to
Lizzie
's
answer
.
<EOS>
"
I
did
not
know
what
I
was
doing
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
what
you
expect
from
me
.
<EOS>
You
had
been
persecuting
me
ever
since
Sir
Florian
's
death
about
the
diamonds
,
and
I
did
n't
know
what
I
was
to
do
.
<EOS>
They
were
my
own
,
and
I
thought
I
was
not
obliged
to
tell
everybody
where
I
kept
them
.
<EOS>
There
are
things
which
nobody
tells
.
<EOS>
If
I
were
to
ask
you
all
your
secrets
,
would
you
tell
them
?
<EOS>
When
Sir
Walter
Scott
was
asked
whether
he
wrote
the
novels
,
he
did
n't
tell
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
was
not
upon
his
oath
,
Lady
Eustace
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
did
take
his
oath
,
 
ever
so
many
times
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
what
difference
an
oath
makes
.
<EOS>
People
ai
n't
obliged
to
tell
their
secrets
,
and
I
would
n't
tell
mine
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
difference
is
this
,
Lady
Eustace
;
 
that
if
you
give
false
evidence
upon
oath
,
you
commit
perjury
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
was
I
to
think
of
that
,
when
I
was
so
frightened
and
confused
that
I
did
n't
know
where
I
was
or
what
I
was
doing
?
<EOS>
There
;
 
now
I
have
told
you
everything
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
Not
quite
everything
.
<EOS>
The
diamonds
were
not
stolen
at
Carlisle
,
but
they
were
stolen
afterwards
.
<EOS>
Did
you
tell
the
police
what
you
had
lost
,
 
or
the
magistrate
,
 
after
the
robbery
in
Hertford
Street
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
I
did
.
<EOS>
There
was
some
money
taken
,
and
rings
,
and
other
jewellery
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
you
tell
them
that
the
diamonds
had
been
really
stolen
on
that
occasion
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
never
asked
me
,
Mr.
Camperdown
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
all
as
clear
as
a
pike
-
staff
,
John
,
"
said
the
lawyer
.
  
<EOS>
"
Quite
clear
,
I
should
say
,
"
replied
Mr.
Eustace
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
I
suppose
I
may
go
,
"
said
Lizzie
,
rising
from
her
chair
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
no
reason
why
she
should
not
go
;
and
,
indeed
,
now
that
the
interview
was
over
,
there
did
not
seem
to
be
any
reason
why
she
should
have
come
.
<EOS>
Though
they
had
heard
so
much
from
her
own
mouth
,
they
knew
no
more
than
they
had
known
before
.
<EOS>
The
great
mystery
had
been
elucidated
,
and
Lizzie
Eustace
had
been
found
to
be
the
intriguing
villain
;
but
it
was
quite
clear
,
even
to
Mr.
Camperdown
,
that
nothing
could
be
done
to
her
.
<EOS>
He
had
never
really
thought
that
it
would
be
expedient
that
she
should
be
prosecuted
for
perjury
,
and
he
now
found
that
she
must
go
utterly
scatheless
,
although
,
by
her
obstinacy
and
dishonesty
,
she
had
inflicted
so
great
a
loss
on
the
distinguished
family
which
had
taken
her
to
its
bosom
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
reason
for
wishing
to
detain
you
,
Lady
Eustace
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
If
I
were
to
talk
for
ever
,
I
should
not
,
probably
,
make
you
understand
the
extent
of
the
injury
you
have
done
,
or
teach
you
to
look
in
a
proper
light
at
the
position
in
which
you
have
placed
yourself
and
all
those
who
belong
to
you
.
<EOS>
When
your
husband
died
,
good
advice
was
given
you
,
and
given
,
I
think
,
in
a
very
kind
way
.
<EOS>
You
would
not
listen
to
it
,
and
you
see
the
result
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
ai
n't
a
bit
ashamed
of
anything
,
"
said
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
not
,
"
rejoined
Mr.
Camperdown
.
  
<EOS>
"
Good
-
bye
,
John
.
"
<EOS>
And
Lizzie
put
out
her
hand
to
her
brother
-
in
-
law
.
  
<EOS>
"
Good
-
bye
,
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Mr.
Camperdown
,
I
have
the
honour
to
wish
you
good
morning
.
"
<EOS>
And
Lizzie
made
a
low
curtsey
to
the
lawyer
,
and
was
then
attended
to
her
carriage
by
the
lawyer
's
clerk
.
<EOS>
She
had
certainly
come
forth
from
the
interview
without
fresh
wounds
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
barrister
who
will
have
the
cross
-
examining
of
her
at
the
Central
Criminal
Court
,
"
said
Mr.
Camperdown
,
as
soon
as
the
door
was
closed
behind
her
,
"
will
have
a
job
of
work
on
his
hands
.
<EOS>
There
's
nothing
a
pretty
woman
ca
n't
do
when
she
has
got
rid
of
all
sense
of
shame
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
is
a
very
great
woman
,
"
said
John
Eustace
,
 
"
a
very
great
woman
;
and
,
if
the
sex
could
have
its
rights
,
would
make
an
excellent
lawyer
.
<EOS>
"
In
the
meantime
Lizzie
Eustace
returned
home
to
Hertford
Street
in
triumph
.
   
<EOS>
Lizzie
's
Last
Lover
 
<EOS>
Lizzie
's
interview
with
the
lawyer
took
place
on
the
Wednesday
afternoon
,
and
,
on
her
return
to
Hertford
Street
she
found
a
note
from
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
made
arrangements
for
dining
out
to
-
day
,
and
shall
not
return
till
after
ten
.
<EOS>
I
will
do
the
same
to
-
morrow
,
and
on
every
day
till
you
leave
town
,
and
you
can
breakfast
in
your
own
room
.
<EOS>
Of
course
you
will
carry
out
your
plan
for
leaving
this
house
on
Monday
.
<EOS>
After
what
has
passed
,
I
shall
prefer
not
to
meet
you
again
.
 
<EOS>
J.C.
<EOS>
"
And
this
was
written
by
a
woman
who
,
but
a
few
days
since
,
had
borrowed
£
150
from
her
,
and
who
at
this
moment
had
in
her
hands
fifty
pounds
"
worth
of
silver
-
plate
,
supposed
to
have
been
given
to
Lucinda
,
and
which
clearly
ought
to
have
been
returned
to
the
donor
when
Lucinda
's
marriage
was
 
postponed
,
as
the
newspapers
had
said
!
<EOS>
Lucinda
at
this
time
had
left
the
house
in
Hertford
Street
,
but
Lizzie
had
not
been
informed
whither
she
had
been
taken
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
apply
to
Lucinda
for
restitution
of
the
silver
,
 
which
was
,
in
fact
,
held
at
the
moment
by
the
Albemarle
Street
hotel
-
keeper
as
part
security
for
his
debt
,
 
and
she
was
quite
sure
that
any
application
to
Mrs.
Carbuncle
for
either
the
silver
or
the
debt
would
be
unavailing
.
<EOS>
But
she
might
,
perhaps
,
cause
annoyance
by
a
letter
,
and
could
,
at
any
rate
,
return
insult
for
insult
.
<EOS>
She
therefore
wrote
to
her
late
friend
.
  
<EOS>
MADAM
,
  
<EOS>
I
certainly
am
not
desirous
of
continuing
an
acquaintance
into
which
I
was
led
by
false
representations
,
and
in
the
course
of
which
I
have
been
almost
absurdly
hospitable
to
persons
altogether
unworthy
of
my
kindness
.
<EOS>
You
,
and
your
niece
,
and
your
especial
friend
Lord
George
Carruthers
,
and
that
unfortunate
young
man
your
niece
's
lover
,
were
entertained
at
my
country
-
house
as
my
guests
for
some
months
.
<EOS>
I
am
here
,
in
my
own
right
,
by
arrangement
;
and
as
I
pay
more
than
a
proper
share
of
the
expense
of
the
establishment
,
I
shall
stay
as
long
as
I
please
,
and
go
when
I
please
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
,
as
we
are
about
to
part
,
certainly
for
ever
,
I
must
beg
you
at
once
to
repay
me
the
sum
of
£
150
,
 
which
you
have
borrowed
from
me
;
and
I
must
also
insist
on
your
letting
me
have
back
the
present
of
silver
which
was
prepared
for
your
niece
's
marriage
.
<EOS>
That
you
should
retain
it
as
a
perquisite
for
yourself
can
not
for
a
moment
be
thought
of
,
however
convenient
it
might
be
to
yourself
.
  
<EOS>
Yours
,
&
c.
,
  
E.
EUSTACE
.
  
<EOS>
As
far
as
the
application
for
restitution
went
,
or
indeed
in
regard
to
the
insult
,
she
might
as
well
have
written
to
a
milestone
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
was
much
too
strong
,
and
had
fought
her
battle
with
the
world
much
too
long
,
to
regard
such
word
-
pelting
as
that
.
<EOS>
She
paid
no
attention
to
the
note
,
and
as
she
had
come
to
terms
with
the
agent
of
the
house
by
which
she
was
to
evacuate
it
on
the
following
Monday
,
 
a
fact
which
was
communicated
to
Lizzie
by
the
servant
,
 
<EOS>
she
did
not
much
regard
Lizzie
's
threat
to
remain
there
.
<EOS>
She
knew
,
moreover
,
that
arrangements
were
already
being
made
for
the
journey
to
Scotland
.
  
<EOS>
Lizzie
had
come
back
from
the
attorney
's
chambers
in
triumph
,
and
had
been
triumphant
when
she
wrote
her
note
to
Mrs.
Carbuncle
;
but
her
elation
was
considerably
repressed
by
a
short
notice
which
she
read
in
the
fashionable
evening
paper
of
the
day
.
<EOS>
She
always
took
the
fashionable
evening
paper
,
and
had
taught
herself
to
think
that
life
without
it
was
impossible
.
<EOS>
But
on
this
afternoon
she
quarrelled
with
that
fashionable
evening
paper
for
ever
.
<EOS>
The
popular
and
well
-
informed
organ
of
intelligence
in
question
informed
its
readers
,
that
the
Eustace
diamonds
 
&
c.
,
&
c.
<EOS>
In
fact
,
it
told
the
whole
story
;
and
then
expressed
a
hope
that
,
as
the
matter
had
from
the
commencement
been
one
of
great
interest
to
the
public
,
who
had
sympathised
with
Lady
Eustace
deeply
as
to
the
loss
of
her
diamonds
,
Lady
Eustace
would
be
able
to
explain
that
part
of
her
conduct
which
certainly
,
at
present
,
was
quite
unintelligible
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
threw
the
paper
from
her
with
indignation
,
asking
what
right
newspaper
scribblers
could
have
to
interfere
with
the
private
affairs
of
such
persons
as
herself
!
  
<EOS>
But
on
this
evening
the
question
of
her
answer
to
Lord
Fawn
was
the
one
which
most
interested
her
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
had
taken
long
in
the
writing
of
his
letter
,
and
she
was
justified
in
taking
what
time
she
pleased
in
answering
it
;
 
but
,
for
her
own
sake
,
it
had
better
be
answered
quickly
.
<EOS>
She
had
tried
her
hand
at
two
different
replies
,
and
did
not
at
all
doubt
but
what
she
would
send
the
affirmative
answer
,
if
she
were
sure
that
these
latter
discoveries
would
not
alter
Lord
Fawn
's
decision
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
had
distinctly
told
her
that
,
if
she
pleased
,
he
would
marry
her
.
<EOS>
She
would
please
;
 
having
been
much
troubled
by
the
circumstances
of
the
past
six
months
.
<EOS>
But
then
,
was
it
not
almost
a
certainty
that
Lord
Fawn
would
retreat
from
his
offer
on
learning
the
facts
which
were
now
so
well
known
as
to
have
been
related
in
the
public
papers
?
<EOS>
She
thought
that
she
would
take
one
more
night
to
think
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
Alas
!
<EOS>
she
took
one
night
too
many
.
<EOS>
On
the
next
morning
,
while
she
was
still
in
bed
,
a
letter
was
brought
to
her
from
Lord
Fawn
,
dated
from
his
club
the
preceding
evening
.
"
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
presents
his
compliments
to
Lady
Eustace
.
<EOS>
Lady
Eustace
will
be
kind
enough
to
understand
that
Lord
Fawn
recedes
altogether
from
the
proposition
made
by
him
in
his
letter
to
Lady
Eustace
dated
March
28th
last
.
<EOS>
Should
Lady
Eustace
think
proper
to
call
in
question
the
propriety
of
this
decision
on
the
part
of
Lord
Fawn
,
she
had
better
refer
the
question
to
some
friend
,
and
Lord
Fawn
will
do
the
same
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
thinks
it
best
to
express
his
determination
,
under
no
circumstances
,
to
communicate
again
personally
with
Lady
Eustace
on
this
subject
,
 
or
,
as
far
as
he
can
see
at
present
,
on
any
other
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
letter
was
a
blow
to
her
,
although
she
had
felt
quite
certain
that
Lord
Fawn
would
have
no
difficulty
in
escaping
from
her
hands
as
soon
as
the
story
of
the
diamonds
should
be
made
public
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
blow
to
her
,
although
she
had
assured
herself
a
dozen
times
that
a
marriage
with
such
a
one
as
Lord
Fawn
,
a
man
who
had
not
a
grain
of
poetry
in
his
composition
,
would
make
her
unutterably
wretched
.
<EOS>
What
escape
would
her
heart
have
had
from
itself
in
such
a
union
?
<EOS>
This
question
she
had
asked
herself
over
and
over
again
,
and
there
had
been
no
answer
to
it
.
<EOS>
But
then
why
had
she
not
been
beforehand
with
Lord
Fawn
?
<EOS>
Why
had
she
not
rejected
his
second
offer
with
the
scorn
which
such
an
offer
had
deserved
?
<EOS>
Ah
,
 
there
was
her
misfortune
;
there
was
her
fault
!
  
<EOS>
But
,
with
Lizzie
Eustace
,
when
she
could
not
do
a
thing
which
it
was
desirable
that
she
should
be
known
to
have
done
,
the
next
consideration
was
whether
she
could
not
so
arrange
as
to
seem
to
have
done
it
.
<EOS>
The
arrival
of
Lord
Fawn
's
note
just
as
she
was
about
to
write
to
him
,
was
unfortunate
.
<EOS>
But
she
would
still
write
to
him
,
and
date
her
letter
before
the
time
that
his
was
dated
.
<EOS>
He
probably
would
not
believe
her
date
.
<EOS>
She
hardly
ever
expected
to
be
really
believed
by
anybody
.
<EOS>
But
he
would
have
to
read
what
she
wrote
;
and
writing
on
this
pretence
,
she
would
avoid
the
necessity
of
alluding
to
his
last
letter
.
  
<EOS>
Neither
of
the
notes
which
she
had
by
her
quite
suited
the
occasion
,
 
so
she
wrote
a
third
.
<EOS>
The
former
letter
in
which
she
declined
his
offer
was
,
she
thought
,
very
charmingly
insolent
,
and
the
allusion
to
his
lordship
's
scullion
would
have
been
successful
,
had
it
been
sent
on
the
moment
,
but
now
a
graver
letter
was
required
,
 
and
the
graver
letter
was
as
follows
:
    
Hertford
Street
,
Wednesday
,
April
3
.
  
---
<EOS>
The
date
,
it
will
be
observed
,
was
the
day
previous
to
the
morning
on
which
she
had
received
Lord
Fawn
's
last
very
conclusive
note
.
    
<EOS>
MY
LORD
,
  
I
have
taken
a
week
to
answer
the
letter
which
your
lordship
has
done
me
the
honour
of
writing
to
me
,
because
I
have
thought
it
best
to
have
time
for
consideration
in
a
matter
of
such
importance
.
<EOS>
In
this
I
have
copied
your
lordship
's
official
caution
.
  
<EOS>
I
think
I
never
read
a
letter
so
false
,
so
unmanly
,
and
so
cowardly
,
as
that
which
you
have
found
yourself
capable
of
sending
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
You
became
engaged
to
me
when
,
as
I
admit
with
shame
,
I
did
not
know
your
character
.
<EOS>
You
have
since
repudiated
me
and
vilified
my
name
,
simply
because
,
having
found
that
I
had
enemies
,
and
being
afraid
to
face
them
,
you
wished
to
escape
from
your
engagement
.
<EOS>
It
has
been
cowardice
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
.
<EOS>
Your
whole
conduct
to
me
has
been
one
long
,
unprovoked
insult
,
studiously
concocted
,
because
you
have
feared
that
there
might
possibly
be
some
trouble
for
you
to
encounter
.
<EOS>
Nobody
ever
heard
of
anything
<EOS>
so
mean
,
either
in
novels
or
in
real
life
.
  
<EOS>
And
now
you
again
offer
to
marry
me
,
 
because
you
are
again
afraid
.
<EOS>
You
think
you
will
be
thrashed
,
I
suppose
,
if
you
decline
to
keep
your
engagement
;
and
feel
that
if
you
offer
to
go
on
with
it
,
my
friends
can
not
beat
you
.
<EOS>
You
need
not
be
afraid
.
<EOS>
No
earthly
consideration
would
induce
me
to
be
your
wife
.
<EOS>
And
if
any
friend
of
mine
should
look
at
you
as
though
he
meant
to
punish
you
,
you
can
show
him
this
letter
and
make
him
understand
that
it
is
I
who
have
refused
to
be
your
wife
,
and
not
you
who
have
refused
to
be
my
husband
.
  
<EOS>
E.
EUSTACE
.
  
<EOS>
This
epistle
Lizzie
did
send
,
believing
that
she
could
add
nothing
to
its
insolence
,
let
her
study
it
as
she
might
.
<EOS>
And
,
she
thought
,
as
she
read
it
for
the
fifth
time
,
that
it
sounded
as
though
it
had
been
written
before
her
receipt
of
the
final
note
from
himself
,
and
that
it
would
,
therefore
,
irritate
him
the
more
.
  
<EOS>
This
was
to
be
the
last
week
of
her
sojourn
in
town
,
and
then
she
was
to
go
down
and
bury
herself
at
Portray
,
with
no
other
companionship
than
that
of
the
faithful
Macnulty
,
who
had
been
left
in
Scotland
for
the
last
three
months
as
nurse
-
in
-
chief
to
the
little
heir
.
<EOS>
She
must
go
and
give
her
evidence
before
the
magistrate
on
Friday
,
as
to
which
she
had
already
received
an
odious
slip
of
paper
;
 
but
Frank
would
accompany
her
.
<EOS>
Other
misfortunes
had
passed
off
so
lightly
that
she
hardly
dreaded
this
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
quite
understand
why
she
was
to
be
so
banished
,
and
thought
much
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
She
had
submitted
herself
to
Frank
's
advice
when
first
she
had
begun
to
fear
that
her
troubles
would
be
insuperable
.
<EOS>
Her
troubles
were
now
disappearing
;
and
,
as
for
Frank
,
 
what
was
Frank
to
her
,
that
she
should
obey
him
?
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
her
trunks
were
being
already
packed
,
and
she
knew
that
she
must
go
.
<EOS>
He
was
to
accompany
her
on
her
journey
,
and
she
would
still
have
one
more
chance
with
him
.
  
<EOS>
As
she
was
thinking
of
all
this
,
Mr.
Emilius
,
the
clergyman
,
was
announced
.
<EOS>
In
her
loneliness
she
was
delighted
to
receive
any
visitor
,
and
she
knew
that
Mr.
Emilius
would
be
at
least
courteous
to
her
.
<EOS>
When
he
had
seated
himself
,
he
at
once
began
to
talk
about
the
misfortune
of
the
unaccomplished
marriage
,
and
in
a
very
low
voice
hinted
that
from
the
beginning
to
end
there
had
been
something
wrong
.
<EOS>
He
had
always
feared
that
an
alliance
based
on
a
footing
that
was
so
openly
"
pecuniary
,
"
 
he
declared
that
the
word
pecuniary
expressed
his
meaning
better
than
any
other
epithet
,
 
could
not
lead
to
matrimonial
happiness
.
<EOS>
"
We
all
know
,
"
said
he
,
"
that
our
dear
friend
,
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
had
views
of
her
own
quite
distinct
from
her
niece
's
happiness
.
<EOS>
I
have
the
greatest
possible
respect
for
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
 
and
I
may
say
esteem
;
but
it
is
impossible
to
live
long
in
any
degree
of
intimacy
with
Mrs.
Carbuncle
without
seeing
that
she
is
 
mercenary
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Mercenary
;
 
indeed
she
is
,
"
said
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
observed
it
?
<EOS>
Oh
,
yes
;
it
is
so
,
and
it
casts
a
shadow
over
a
character
which
otherwise
has
so
much
to
charm
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
is
the
most
insolent
and
the
most
ungrateful
woman
that
I
ever
heard
of
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Lizzie
,
with
energy
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Emilius
opened
his
eyes
,
but
did
not
contradict
her
assertion
.
"
<EOS>
As
you
have
mentioned
her
name
,
Mr.
Emilius
,
I
must
tell
you
.
<EOS>
I
have
done
everything
for
that
woman
.
<EOS>
You
know
how
I
treated
her
down
in
Scotland
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
With
a
splendid
hospitality
,
"
said
Mr.
Emilius
.
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
she
did
not
pay
for
anything
there
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
no
.
<EOS>
"
The
idea
of
any
one
being
called
upon
to
pay
for
what
one
ate
and
drank
at
a
friend
's
house
,
was
peculiarly
painful
to
Mr.
Emilius
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
have
paid
for
everything
here
.
<EOS>
That
is
to
say
,
we
have
made
an
arrangement
,
very
much
in
her
favour
.
<EOS>
And
she
has
borrowed
large
sums
of
money
from
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
at
all
surprised
at
that
,
"
said
Mr.
Emilius
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
when
that
unfortunate
girl
,
her
niece
,
was
to
be
married
to
poor
Sir
Griffin
Tewett
,
I
gave
her
a
whole
service
of
plate
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
unparalleled
generosity
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Would
you
believe
she
has
taken
the
whole
for
her
own
base
purposes
?
<EOS>
And
then
what
do
you
think
she
has
done
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Lady
Eustace
,
hardly
anything
would
astonish
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lizzie
suddenly
found
a
difficulty
in
describing
to
her
friend
the
fact
that
Mrs.
Carbuncle
was
endeavouring
to
turn
her
out
of
the
house
,
without
also
alluding
to
her
own
troubles
about
the
robbery
.
<EOS>
"
She
has
actually
told
me
,
"
she
continued
,
"
that
I
must
leave
the
house
without
a
day
's
warning
.
<EOS>
But
I
believe
the
truth
is
,
that
she
has
run
so
much
into
debt
that
she
can
not
remain
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
that
she
is
very
much
in
debt
,
Lady
Eustace
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
she
owed
me
some
civility
.
<EOS>
Instead
of
that
,
she
has
treated
me
with
nothing
but
insolence
.
<EOS>
And
why
,
do
you
think
?
<EOS>
It
is
all
because
I
would
not
allow
her
to
take
that
poor
,
insane
young
woman
to
Portray
Castle
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
mean
that
she
asked
to
go
there
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
did
,
though
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
heard
such
impertinence
in
my
life
,
 
never
,
"
said
Mr.
Emilius
,
again
opening
his
eyes
and
shaking
his
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
proposed
that
I
should
ask
them
both
down
to
Portray
,
for
 
for
 
<EOS>
of
course
it
would
have
been
almost
for
ever
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
how
I
should
have
got
rid
of
them
.
<EOS>
And
that
poor
young
woman
is
mad
,
you
know
;
 
quite
mad
.
<EOS>
She
never
recovered
herself
after
that
morning
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
 
what
I
have
suffered
about
that
unhappy
marriage
,
and
the
cruel
,
cruel
way
in
which
Mrs.
Carbuncle
urged
it
on
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Emilius
,
you
ca
n't
conceive
the
scenes
which
have
been
acted
in
this
house
during
the
last
month
.
<EOS>
It
has
been
dreadful
.
<EOS>
I
would
n't
go
through
such
a
time
again
for
anything
that
could
be
offered
to
me
.
<EOS>
It
has
made
me
so
ill
that
I
am
obliged
to
go
down
to
Scotland
to
recruit
my
health
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
heard
that
you
were
going
to
Scotland
,
and
I
wished
to
have
an
opportunity
of
saying
 
just
a
word
to
you
,
in
private
,
before
you
go
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Emilius
had
thought
a
good
deal
about
this
interview
,
and
had
prepared
himself
for
it
with
considerable
care
.
<EOS>
He
knew
,
with
tolerable
accuracy
,
the
whole
story
of
the
necklace
,
having
discussed
it
with
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
who
,
as
the
reader
will
remember
,
had
been
told
the
tale
by
Lord
George
.
<EOS>
He
was
aware
of
the
engagement
with
Lord
Fawn
,
and
of
the
growing
intimacy
which
had
existed
between
Lord
George
and
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
watchful
,
diligent
,
patient
,
and
had
at
last
become
hopeful
.
<EOS>
When
he
learned
that
his
beloved
was
about
to
start
for
Scotland
,
he
felt
that
it
would
be
well
that
he
should
strike
a
blow
before
she
went
.
<EOS>
As
to
a
journey
down
to
Ayrshire
,
that
would
be
nothing
to
one
so
enamoured
as
was
Mr.
Emilius
;
and
he
would
not
scruple
to
show
himself
at
the
castle
-
door
without
invitation
.
<EOS>
Whatever
may
have
been
his
deficiencies
,
Mr.
Emilius
did
not
lack
the
courage
needed
to
carry
such
an
enterprise
as
this
to
a
happy
conclusion
.
<EOS>
As
far
as
pluck
and
courage
might
serve
a
man
,
he
was
well
served
by
his
own
gifts
.
<EOS>
He
could
,
without
a
blush
,
or
a
quiver
in
his
voice
,
have
asked
a
duchess
to
marry
him
,
with
ten
times
Lizzie
's
income
.
<EOS>
He
had
now
considered
deeply
whether
,
with
the
view
of
prevailing
,
it
would
be
better
that
he
should
allude
to
the
lady
's
trespasses
in
regard
to
the
diamonds
,
or
that
he
should
pretend
to
be
in
ignorance
;
and
he
had
determined
that
ultimate
success
might
,
with
most
probability
,
be
achieved
by
a
bold
declaration
of
the
truth
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
how
desperately
you
must
be
in
want
of
some
one
to
help
you
through
your
troubles
,
and
I
know
also
that
your
grand
lovers
will
avoid
you
because
of
what
you
have
done
,
and
therefore
you
had
better
take
me
at
once
.
<EOS>
Take
me
,
and
I
'll
bring
you
through
everything
.
<EOS>
Refuse
me
,
and
I
'll
help
to
crush
you
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Such
were
the
arguments
which
Mr.
Emilius
had
determined
to
use
,
and
such
the
language
,
 
of
course
,
with
some
modifications
.
<EOS>
He
was
now
commencing
his
work
,
and
was
quite
resolved
to
leave
no
stone
unturned
in
carrying
it
to
a
successful
issue
.
<EOS>
He
drew
his
chair
nearer
to
Lizzie
as
he
announced
his
desire
for
a
private
interview
,
and
leaned
over
towards
her
with
his
two
hands
closed
together
between
his
knees
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
dark
,
hookey
-
nosed
,
well
-
made
man
,
with
an
exuberance
of
greasy
hair
,
who
would
have
been
considered
handsome
by
many
women
,
had
there
not
been
something
,
almost
amounting
to
a
squint
,
amiss
with
one
of
his
eyes
.
<EOS>
When
he
was
preaching
,
it
could
hardly
be
seen
,
but
in
the
closeness
of
private
conversation
it
was
disagreeable
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
 
indeed
!
"
said
Lizzie
,
with
a
look
of
astonishment
,
perfectly
well
assumed
.
<EOS>
She
had
already
begun
to
consider
whether
,
after
all
,
Mr.
Emilius
 
would
do
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
 
<EOS>
Lady
Eustace
;
it
is
so
.
<EOS>
You
and
I
have
known
each
other
now
for
many
months
,
and
I
have
received
the
most
unaffected
pleasure
from
the
acquaintance
,
 
may
I
not
say
from
the
intimacy
which
has
sprung
up
between
us
?
"
<EOS>
Lizzie
did
not
forbid
the
use
of
the
pleasant
word
,
but
merely
bowed
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
that
,
as
a
devoted
friend
and
a
clergyman
,
I
shall
not
be
thought
to
be
intruding
on
private
ground
in
saying
that
circumstances
have
made
me
aware
of
the
details
of
the
robberies
by
which
you
have
been
so
cruelly
persecuted
.
"
<EOS>
So
the
man
had
come
about
the
diamonds
,
and
not
to
make
an
offer
!
<EOS>
Lizzie
raised
her
eyebrows
and
bowed
her
head
with
the
slightest
possible
motion
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
how
far
your
friends
or
the
public
may
condemn
you
,
but
 
"
  
"
My
friends
do
n't
condemn
me
at
all
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
so
glad
to
hear
it
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nobody
has
dared
to
condemn
me
,
except
this
impudent
woman
here
,
who
wants
an
excuse
for
not
paying
me
what
she
owes
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
delighted
.
<EOS>
I
was
going
to
explain
that
although
I
am
aware
you
have
infringed
the
letter
of
the
law
,
and
made
yourself
liable
to
proceedings
which
may
,
perhaps
,
be
unpleasant
 
"
  
"
I
ai
n't
liable
to
anything
unpleasant
at
all
,
Mr.
Emilius
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
my
mind
is
greatly
relieved
.
<EOS>
I
was
about
to
remark
,
having
heard
in
the
outer
world
that
there
were
those
who
ventured
to
accuse
you
of
 
of
perjury
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nobody
has
dared
to
accuse
me
of
anything
.
<EOS>
What
makes
you
come
here
and
say
such
things
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
 
Lady
Eustace
.
<EOS>
It
is
because
these
calumnies
are
spoken
so
openly
behind
your
back
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Who
speaks
them
?
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
and
Lord
George
Carruthers
;
 
my
enemies
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Emilius
was
beginning
to
feel
that
he
was
not
making
progress
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
on
the
point
of
observing
to
you
that
according
to
the
view
of
the
matter
which
I
,
as
a
clergyman
,
have
taken
,
you
were
altogether
justified
in
the
steps
which
you
took
for
the
protection
of
property
which
was
your
own
,
but
which
had
been
attacked
by
designing
persons
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
I
was
justified
,
"
said
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
best
,
Lady
Eustace
,
whether
any
assistance
I
can
offer
will
avail
you
anything
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
want
any
assistance
,
Mr.
Emilius
,
 
thank
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
certainly
have
been
given
to
understand
that
they
who
ought
to
stand
by
you
with
the
closest
devotion
have
,
in
this
period
of
what
I
may
,
perhaps
,
call
 
tribulation
,
deserted
your
side
with
cold
selfishness
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
there
is
n't
any
tribulation
,
and
nobody
has
deserted
my
side
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
told
that
Lord
Fawn
 
"
  
"
Lord
Fawn
is
an
idiot
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
Quite
so
;
 
no
doubt
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
have
deserted
him
.
<EOS>
I
wrote
to
him
this
very
morning
,
in
answer
to
a
pressing
letter
from
him
to
renew
our
engagement
,
to
tell
him
that
that
was
out
of
the
question
.
<EOS>
I
despise
Lord
Fawn
,
and
my
heart
never
can
be
given
where
my
respect
does
not
accompany
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
noble
sentiment
,
Lady
Eustace
,
which
I
reciprocate
completely
.
<EOS>
And
now
,
to
come
to
what
I
may
call
the
inner
purport
of
my
visit
to
you
this
morning
,
the
sweet
cause
of
my
attendance
on
you
,
let
me
assure
you
that
I
should
not
now
offer
you
my
heart
,
unless
with
my
heart
went
the
most
perfect
respect
and
esteem
which
any
man
ever
felt
for
a
woman
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Emilius
had
found
the
necessity
of
coming
to
the
point
by
some
direct
road
,
as
the
lady
had
refused
to
allow
him
to
lead
up
to
it
in
the
manner
he
had
proposed
to
himself
.
<EOS>
He
still
thought
that
what
he
had
said
might
be
efficacious
,
as
he
did
not
for
a
moment
believe
her
assertions
as
to
her
own
friends
,
and
the
non
-
existence
of
any
trouble
as
to
the
oaths
which
she
had
falsely
sworn
.
<EOS>
But
she
carried
the
matter
with
a
better
courage
than
he
had
expected
to
find
,
and
drove
him
out
of
his
intended
line
of
approach
.
<EOS>
He
had
,
however
,
seized
his
opportunity
without
losing
much
time
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
on
earth
do
you
mean
,
Mr.
Emilius
?
"
she
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
mean
to
lay
my
heart
,
my
hand
,
my
fortunes
,
my
profession
,
my
career
at
your
feet
.
<EOS>
I
make
bold
to
say
of
myself
that
I
have
,
by
my
own
unaided
eloquence
and
intelligence
,
won
for
myself
a
great
position
in
this
swarming
metropolis
.
<EOS>
Lady
Eustace
,
I
know
your
great
rank
.
<EOS>
I
feel
your
transcendent
beauty
,
 
ah
,
too
acutely
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
told
that
you
are
rich
.
<EOS>
But
I
,
myself
,
who
venture
to
approach
you
as
a
suitor
for
your
hand
,
am
also
somebody
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
The
blood
that
runs
in
my
veins
is
as
illustrious
as
your
own
,
having
descended
to
me
from
the
great
and
ancient
nobles
of
my
native
country
.
<EOS>
The
profession
which
I
have
adopted
is
the
grandest
which
ever
filled
the
heart
of
man
with
aspirations
.
<EOS>
I
have
barely
turned
my
thirty
-
second
year
,
and
I
am
known
as
the
greatest
preacher
of
my
day
,
though
I
preach
in
a
language
which
is
not
my
own
.
<EOS>
Your
House
of
Lords
would
be
open
to
me
as
a
spiritual
peer
,
would
I
condescend
to
come
to
terms
with
those
who
crave
the
assistance
which
I
could
give
them
.
<EOS>
I
can
move
the
masses
.
<EOS>
I
can
touch
the
hearts
of
men
.
<EOS>
And
in
this
great
assemblage
of
mankind
which
you
call
London
,
I
can
choose
my
own
society
among
the
highest
of
the
land
.
<EOS>
Lady
Eustace
,
will
you
share
with
me
my
career
and
my
fortunes
?
<EOS>
I
ask
you
,
because
you
are
the
only
woman
whom
my
heart
has
stooped
to
love
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
man
was
a
nasty
,
greasy
,
lying
,
squinting
Jew
preacher
;
an
impostor
,
over
forty
years
of
age
,
whose
greatest
social
success
had
been
achieved
when
,
through
the
agency
of
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
he
made
his
way
into
Portray
Castle
.
<EOS>
He
was
about
as
near
an
English
mitre
as
had
been
that
great
man
of
a
past
generation
,
the
Deputy
Shepherd
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
creature
to
loathe
,
 
because
he
was
greasy
,
and
a
liar
,
and
an
impostor
.
<EOS>
But
there
was
a
certain
manliness
in
him
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
afraid
of
the
woman
;
and
in
pleading
his
cause
with
her
he
could
stand
up
for
himself
courageously
.
<EOS>
He
had
studied
his
speech
,
and
having
studied
it
,
he
knew
how
to
utter
the
words
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
blush
,
nor
stammer
,
nor
cringe
.
<EOS>
Of
grandfather
or
grandmother
belonging
to
himself
he
had
probably
never
heard
,
but
he
could
so
speak
of
his
noble
ancestors
as
to
produce
belief
in
Lizzie
's
mind
.
<EOS>
And
he
almost
succeeded
in
convincing
her
that
he
was
,
by
the
consent
of
mankind
,
the
greatest
preacher
of
the
day
.
<EOS>
While
he
was
making
his
speech
she
almost
liked
his
squint
.
<EOS>
She
certainly
liked
the
grease
and
nastiness
.
<EOS>
Presuming
,
as
she
naturally
did
,
that
something
of
what
he
said
was
false
,
she
liked
the
lies
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
dash
of
poetry
about
him
;
and
poetry
,
as
she
thought
,
was
not
compatible
with
humdrum
truth
.
<EOS>
A
man
,
to
be
a
man
in
her
eyes
,
should
be
able
to
swear
that
all
his
geese
are
swans
;
 
should
be
able
to
reckon
his
swans
by
the
dozen
,
though
he
have
not
a
feather
belonging
to
him
,
even
from
a
goose
's
wing
.
<EOS>
She
liked
his
audacity
;
and
then
,
when
he
was
making
love
,
he
was
not
afraid
of
talking
out
boldly
about
his
heart
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
he
was
only
Mr.
Emilius
,
the
clergyman
;
and
she
had
means
of
knowing
that
his
income
was
not
generous
.
<EOS>
Though
she
admired
his
manner
and
his
language
,
she
was
quite
aware
that
he
was
in
pursuit
of
her
money
.
<EOS>
And
from
the
moment
in
which
she
first
understood
his
object
,
she
was
resolved
that
she
would
never
become
the
wife
of
Mr.
Emilius
as
long
as
there
was
a
hope
as
to
Frank
Greystock
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
told
,
Mr.
Emilius
,
"
she
said
,
"
that
some
time
since
you
used
to
have
a
wife
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
a
falsehood
,
Lady
Eustace
.
<EOS>
From
motives
of
pure
charity
I
gave
a
home
to
a
distant
cousin
.
<EOS>
I
was
then
in
a
land
of
strangers
,
and
my
life
was
misinterpreted
.
<EOS>
I
made
no
complaint
,
but
sent
the
lady
back
to
her
native
country
.
<EOS>
My
compassion
could
supply
her
wants
there
as
well
as
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
you
still
support
her
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Emilius
bethought
himself
for
a
moment
.
<EOS>
There
might
be
danger
in
asserting
that
he
was
subject
to
such
an
encumbrance
.
<EOS>
"
I
did
do
so
,
"
he
answered
,
"
till
she
found
a
congenial
home
as
the
wife
of
an
honest
man
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
I
'm
quite
glad
to
hear
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
now
,
Lady
Eustace
,
may
I
venture
to
hope
for
a
favourable
answer
?
"
  
<EOS>
Upon
this
,
Lizzie
made
him
a
speech
as
long
and
almost
as
well
-
turned
as
his
own
.
<EOS>
Her
heart
had
of
late
been
subject
to
many
vicissitudes
.
<EOS>
She
had
lost
the
dearest
husband
that
a
woman
had
ever
worshipped
.
<EOS>
She
had
ventured
,
for
purposes
with
reference
to
her
child
which
she
could
not
now
explain
,
to
think
once
again
of
matrimony
with
a
man
of
high
rank
,
but
who
had
turned
out
to
be
unworthy
of
her
.
<EOS>
She
had
receded
;
 
Lizzie
,
as
she
said
this
,
acted
the
part
of
receding
with
a
fine
expression
of
scornful
face
;
 
and
after
that
she
was
unwilling
to
entertain
any
further
idea
of
marriage
.
<EOS>
Upon
hearing
this
,
Mr.
Emilius
bowed
low
,
and
before
the
street
-
door
was
closed
against
him
had
begun
to
calculate
how
much
a
journey
to
Scotland
would
cost
him
.
   
<EOS>
Lizzie
at
the
Police
-
Court
 
<EOS>
On
the
Wednesday
and
Thursday
Lizzie
had
been
triumphant
;
for
she
had
certainly
come
out
unscathed
from
Mr.
Camperdown
's
chambers
,
and
a
lady
may
surely
be
said
to
triumph
when
a
gentleman
lays
his
hand
,
his
heart
,
his
fortunes
,
and
all
that
he
has
got
,
at
her
feet
.
<EOS>
But
when
the
Friday
came
,
though
she
was
determined
to
be
brave
,
her
heart
did
sink
within
her
bosom
.
<EOS>
She
understood
well
that
she
would
be
called
upon
to
admit
in
public
the
falseness
of
the
oaths
she
had
sworn
upon
two
occasions
;
and
that
,
though
she
would
not
be
made
amenable
to
any
absolute
punishment
for
her
perjury
,
she
would
be
subject
to
very
damaging
remarks
from
the
magistrate
,
and
probably
also
from
some
lawyers
employed
to
defend
the
prisoners
.
<EOS>
She
went
to
bed
in
fairly
good
spirits
,
but
in
the
morning
she
was
cowed
and
unhappy
.
<EOS>
She
dressed
herself
from
head
to
foot
in
black
,
and
prepared
for
herself
a
heavy
black
veil
.
<EOS>
She
had
ordered
from
the
livery
stable
a
brougham
for
the
occasion
,
thinking
it
wise
to
avoid
the
display
of
her
own
carriage
.
<EOS>
She
breakfasted
early
,
and
then
took
a
large
glass
of
wine
to
support
her
.
<EOS>
When
Frank
called
for
her
at
a
quarter
to
ten
,
she
was
quite
ready
,
and
grasped
his
hand
almost
without
a
word
.
<EOS>
But
she
looked
into
his
face
with
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
.
<EOS>
"
It
will
soon
be
over
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
She
pressed
his
hand
,
and
made
him
a
sign
to
show
that
she
was
ready
to
follow
him
to
the
door
.
<EOS>
"
The
case
will
come
on
at
once
,
"
he
said
,
"
so
that
you
will
not
be
kept
waiting
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
you
are
so
good
;
 
so
good
to
me
.
"
<EOS>
She
pressed
his
arm
,
and
did
not
speak
another
word
on
their
way
to
the
police
-
court
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
great
crowd
about
the
office
,
which
was
in
a
little
by
-
street
,
and
so
circumstanced
that
Lizzie
's
brougham
could
hardly
make
its
way
up
to
the
door
.
<EOS>
But
way
was
at
once
made
for
her
when
Frank
handed
her
out
of
it
,
and
the
policemen
about
the
place
were
as
courteous
to
her
as
though
she
had
been
the
Lord
Chancellor
's
wife
.
<EOS>
Evil
-
doing
will
be
spoken
of
with
bated
breath
and
soft
words
even
by
policemen
,
when
the
evil
-
doer
comes
in
a
carriage
,
and
with
a
title
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
was
led
at
once
into
a
private
room
,
and
told
that
she
would
be
kept
there
only
a
very
few
minutes
.
<EOS>
Frank
made
his
way
into
the
court
and
found
that
two
magistrates
had
just
seated
themselves
on
the
bench
.
<EOS>
One
would
have
sufficed
for
the
occasion
;
but
this
was
a
case
of
great
interest
,
and
even
police
-
magistrates
are
human
in
their
interests
.
<EOS>
Greystock
was
allowed
to
get
round
to
the
bench
,
and
to
whisper
a
word
or
two
to
the
gentleman
who
was
to
preside
.
<EOS>
The
magistrate
nodded
his
head
,
and
then
the
case
began
.
  
<EOS>
The
unfortunate
Mr.
Benjamin
had
been
sent
back
in
durance
vile
from
Vienna
,
and
was
present
in
the
court
.
<EOS>
With
him
,
as
joint
malefactor
,
stood
Mr.
Smiler
,
the
great
housebreaker
,
a
huge
,
ugly
,
resolute
-
looking
scoundrel
,
possessed
of
enormous
strength
,
who
was
very
intimately
known
to
the
police
,
with
whom
he
had
had
various
dealings
since
he
had
been
turned
out
upon
the
town
to
earn
his
bread
some
fifteen
years
before
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
long
before
that
he
had
known
the
police
.
<EOS>
As
far
as
his
memory
went
back
he
had
always
known
them
.
<EOS>
But
the
sportive
industry
of
his
boyish
years
was
not
now
counted
up
against
him
.
<EOS>
In
the
last
fifteen
years
his
biography
had
been
written
with
all
the
accuracy
due
to
the
achievements
of
a
great
man
;
and
during
those
hundred
and
eighty
months
he
had
spent
over
one
hundred
in
prison
,
and
had
been
convicted
twenty
-
three
times
.
<EOS>
He
was
now
growing
old
,
 
as
a
thief
;
and
it
was
thought
by
his
friends
that
he
would
be
settled
for
life
in
some
quiet
retreat
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Benjamin
was
a
very
respectable
-
looking
man
of
about
fifty
,
with
slightly
grizzled
hair
,
with
excellent
black
clothes
,
showing
,
by
a
surprised
air
,
his
great
astonishment
at
finding
himself
in
such
a
position
.
<EOS>
He
spoke
constantly
,
both
to
his
attorney
and
to
the
barrister
who
was
to
show
cause
why
he
should
not
be
committed
,
and
throughout
the
whole
morning
was
very
busy
.
<EOS>
Smiler
,
who
was
quite
at
home
,
and
who
understood
his
position
,
never
said
a
word
to
any
one
.
<EOS>
He
stood
,
perfectly
straight
,
looking
at
the
magistrate
,
and
never
for
a
moment
leaning
on
the
rail
before
him
during
the
four
hours
that
the
case
consumed
.
<EOS>
Once
,
when
his
friend
,
Billy
Cann
,
was
brought
into
court
to
give
evidence
against
him
,
dressed
up
to
the
eyes
,
serene
and
sleek
as
when
we
saw
him
once
before
at
the
"
Rising
Sun
,
"
in
Meek
Street
,
Smiler
turned
a
glance
upon
him
which
,
to
the
eyes
of
all
present
,
contained
a
threat
of
most
bloody
revenge
.
<EOS>
But
Billy
knew
the
advantages
of
his
situation
,
and
nodded
at
his
old
comrade
,
and
smiled
.
<EOS>
His
old
comrade
was
very
much
stronger
than
he
,
and
possessed
of
many
natural
advantages
;
but
,
perhaps
,
upon
the
whole
,
his
old
comrade
had
been
the
less
intelligent
thief
of
the
two
.
<EOS>
It
was
thus
that
the
bystanders
read
the
meaning
of
Billy
's
smile
.
  
<EOS>
The
case
was
opened
very
shortly
and
very
clearly
by
the
gentleman
who
was
employed
for
the
prosecution
.
<EOS>
It
would
all
,
he
said
,
have
laid
in
a
nutshell
,
had
it
not
been
complicated
by
a
previous
robbery
at
Carlisle
.
<EOS>
Were
it
necessary
,
he
said
,
there
would
be
no
difficulty
in
convicting
the
prisoners
for
that
offence
also
,
but
it
had
been
thought
advisable
to
confine
the
prosecution
to
the
act
of
burglary
committed
in
Hertford
Street
.
<EOS>
He
stated
the
facts
of
what
had
happened
at
Carlisle
,
merely
for
explanation
,
but
would
state
nothing
that
could
not
be
proved
.
<EOS>
Then
he
told
all
that
the
reader
knows
about
the
iron
box
.
<EOS>
But
the
diamonds
were
not
then
in
the
box
,
 
and
he
told
that
story
also
,
treating
Lizzie
with
great
tenderness
as
he
did
so
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
,
all
this
time
,
was
sitting
behind
her
veil
in
the
private
room
,
and
did
not
hear
a
word
of
what
was
going
on
.
<EOS>
Then
he
came
to
the
robbery
in
Hertford
Street
.
<EOS>
He
would
prove
by
Lady
Eustace
that
the
diamonds
were
left
by
her
in
a
locked
desk
,
 
were
so
deposited
,
though
all
her
friends
believed
them
to
have
been
taken
at
Carlisle
;
and
he
would
,
moreover
,
prove
by
accomplices
that
they
were
stolen
by
two
men
,
 
the
younger
prisoner
at
the
bar
being
one
of
them
,
and
the
witness
who
would
be
adduced
,
the
other
,
 
that
they
were
given
up
by
these
men
to
the
elder
prisoner
,
and
that
a
certain
sum
had
been
paid
by
him
for
the
execution
of
the
two
robberies
.
<EOS>
There
was
much
more
of
it
;
 
but
to
the
reader
,
who
knows
it
all
,
it
would
be
but
a
thrice
-
told
tale
.
<EOS>
He
then
said
that
he
first
proposed
to
take
the
evidence
of
Lady
Eustace
,
the
lady
who
had
been
in
possession
of
the
diamonds
when
they
were
stolen
.
<EOS>
Then
Frank
Greystock
left
the
court
,
and
returned
with
poor
Lizzie
on
his
arm
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
handed
to
a
chair
,
and
,
after
she
was
sworn
,
was
told
that
she
might
sit
down
.
<EOS>
But
she
was
requested
to
remove
her
veil
,
which
she
had
replaced
as
soon
as
she
had
kissed
the
book
.
<EOS>
The
first
question
asked
her
was
very
easy
.
<EOS>
Did
she
remember
the
night
at
Carlisle
?
<EOS>
Would
she
tell
the
history
of
what
occurred
on
that
night
?
<EOS>
When
the
box
was
stolen
,
were
the
diamonds
in
it
?
<EOS>
No
;
she
had
taken
the
diamonds
out
for
security
,
and
had
kept
them
under
her
pillow
.
<EOS>
Then
came
a
bitter
moment
,
in
which
she
had
to
confess
her
perjury
before
the
Carlisle
bench
;
 
but
even
that
seemed
to
pass
off
smoothly
.
<EOS>
The
magistrate
asked
one
severe
question
.
<EOS>
"
Do
you
mean
to
say
,
Lady
Eustace
,
that
you
gave
false
evidence
on
that
occasion
,
 
knowing
it
to
be
false
?
"
<EOS>
"
I
was
in
such
a
state
,
sir
,
from
fear
,
that
I
did
not
know
what
I
was
saying
,
"
exclaimed
Lizzie
,
bursting
into
tears
and
stretching
forth
towards
the
bench
her
two
clasped
hands
with
the
air
of
a
suppliant
.
<EOS>
From
that
moment
the
magistrate
was
altogether
on
her
side
,
 
and
so
were
the
public
.
<EOS>
Poor
ignorant
,
ill
-
used
young
creature
;
 
and
then
so
lovely
!
<EOS>
That
was
the
general
feeling
.
<EOS>
But
she
had
not
as
yet
come
beneath
the
harrow
of
the
learned
gentleman
on
the
other
side
,
whose
best
talents
were
due
to
Mr.
Benjamin
.
<EOS>
Then
she
told
all
she
knew
about
the
other
robbery
.
<EOS>
She
certainly
had
not
said
,
when
examined
on
that
occasion
,
that
the
diamonds
had
then
been
taken
.
<EOS>
She
had
omitted
to
name
the
diamonds
in
her
catalogue
of
the
things
stolen
;
but
she
was
sure
that
she
had
never
said
that
they
were
not
then
taken
.
<EOS>
She
had
said
nothing
about
the
diamonds
,
knowing
them
to
be
her
own
,
and
preferring
to
lose
them
to
the
trouble
of
again
referring
to
the
night
at
Carlisle
.
<EOS>
Such
was
her
evidence
for
the
prosecution
,
and
then
she
was
turned
over
to
the
very
learned
and
very
acute
gentleman
whom
Mr.
Benjamin
had
hired
for
his
defence
,
 
or
rather
,
to
show
cause
why
he
should
not
be
sent
for
trial
.
  
<EOS>
It
must
be
owned
that
poor
Lizzie
did
receive
from
his
hands
some
of
that
punishment
which
she
certainly
deserved
.
<EOS>
This
acute
and
learned
gentleman
seemed
to
possess
for
the
occasion
the
blandest
and
most
dulcet
voice
that
ever
was
bestowed
upon
an
English
barrister
.
<EOS>
He
addressed
Lady
Eustace
with
the
softest
words
,
as
though
he
hardly
dared
to
speak
to
a
woman
so
eminent
for
wealth
,
rank
,
and
beauty
;
but
nevertheless
he
asked
her
some
very
disagreeable
questions
.
<EOS>
"
Was
he
to
understand
that
she
went
of
her
own
will
before
the
bench
of
magistrates
at
Carlisle
,
with
the
view
of
enabling
the
police
to
capture
certain
persons
for
stealing
certain
jewels
,
while
she
knew
that
the
jewels
were
actually
in
her
own
possession
?
"
Lizzie
,
confounded
by
the
softness
of
his
voice
as
joined
to
the
harshness
of
the
question
,
could
hardly
understand
him
,
and
he
repeated
it
thrice
,
becoming
every
time
more
and
more
mellifluous
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
"
said
Lizzie
at
last
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
?
"
he
asked
.
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
"
Your
ladyship
did
send
the
Cumberland
police
after
men
for
stealing
jewels
which
were
in
your
ladyship
's
own
hands
when
you
swore
the
information
?
"
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
your
ladyship
knew
that
the
information
was
untrue
?
"
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
the
police
were
pursuing
the
men
for
many
weeks
?
"
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
On
your
information
?
"
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Lizzie
,
through
her
tears
.
"
<EOS>
And
your
ladyship
knew
all
the
time
that
the
poor
men
were
altogether
innocent
of
taking
the
jewels
?
"
<EOS>
"
But
they
took
the
box
,
"
said
Lizzie
,
through
her
tears
.
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
the
acute
and
learned
gentleman
,
"
somebody
took
your
ladyship
's
iron
box
out
of
the
room
,
and
you
swore
that
the
diamonds
had
been
taken
.
<EOS>
Was
it
not
the
fact
that
legal
proceedings
were
being
taken
against
you
for
recovery
of
the
diamonds
by
persons
who
claimed
the
property
?
"
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
"
And
these
persons
withdrew
their
proceedings
as
soon
as
they
heard
that
the
diamonds
had
been
stolen
?
"
  
<EOS>
Soft
as
he
was
in
his
manner
,
he
nearly
reduced
Lizzie
Eustace
to
fainting
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
to
her
that
the
questions
would
never
end
.
<EOS>
It
was
in
vain
that
the
magistrate
pointed
out
to
the
learned
gentleman
that
Lady
Eustace
had
confessed
her
own
false
swearing
,
both
at
Carlisle
and
in
London
,
a
dozen
times
.
<EOS>
He
continued
his
questions
over
and
over
again
,
harping
chiefly
on
the
affair
at
Carlisle
,
and
saying
very
little
as
to
the
second
robbery
in
Hertford
Street
.
<EOS>
His
idea
was
to
make
it
appear
that
Lizzie
had
arranged
the
robbery
with
the
view
of
defrauding
Mr.
Camperdown
,
and
that
Lord
George
Carruthers
was
her
accomplice
.
<EOS>
He
even
asked
her
,
almost
in
a
whisper
,
and
with
the
sweetest
smile
,
whether
she
was
not
engaged
to
marry
Lord
George
.
<EOS>
When
Lizzie
denied
this
,
he
still
suggested
that
some
such
alliance
might
be
in
contemplation
.
<EOS>
Upon
this
,
Frank
Greystock
called
upon
the
magistrate
to
defend
Lady
Eustace
from
such
unnecessary
vulgarity
,
and
there
was
a
scene
in
the
court
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
did
not
like
the
scene
,
but
it
helped
to
protect
her
from
the
contemplation
of
the
public
,
who
of
course
were
much
gratified
by
high
words
between
two
barristers
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Eustace
was
forced
to
remain
in
the
private
room
during
the
examination
of
Patience
Crabstick
and
Mr.
Cann
;
and
she
did
not
hear
it
.
<EOS>
Patience
was
a
most
obdurate
and
difficult
witness
,
 
extremely
averse
to
say
evil
of
herself
,
and
on
that
account
unworthy
of
the
good
things
which
she
had
received
.
<EOS>
But
Billy
Cann
was
charming
,
 
graceful
,
communicative
,
and
absolutely
accurate
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
shaking
him
.
<EOS>
The
learned
and
acute
gentleman
who
tried
to
tear
him
in
pieces
could
do
nothing
with
him
.
<EOS>
He
was
asked
whether
he
had
not
been
a
professional
thief
for
ten
years
.
<EOS>
"
Ten
or
twelve
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
Did
he
expect
that
any
juryman
would
believe
him
on
his
oath
?
"
<EOS>
Not
unless
I
am
fully
corroborated
.
"
<EOS>
"
Can
you
look
that
man
in
the
face
,
 
that
man
who
is
at
any
rate
so
much
honester
than
yourself
?
"
asked
the
learned
gentleman
with
pathos
.
<EOS>
Billy
said
that
he
thought
he
could
,
and
the
way
in
which
he
smiled
upon
Smiler
caused
a
roar
through
the
whole
court
.
  
<EOS>
The
two
men
were
,
as
a
matter
of
course
,
committed
for
trial
at
the
Central
Criminal
Court
,
and
Lizzie
Eustace
was
bound
by
certain
penalties
to
come
forward
when
called
upon
,
and
give
her
evidence
again
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
that
it
is
over
,
"
said
Frank
,
as
he
left
her
at
Mrs.
Carbuncle
's
hall
-
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Frank
,
dearest
Frank
,
where
should
I
be
if
it
were
not
for
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
Lord
George
Gives
His
Reasons
 
<EOS>
Lady
Eustace
did
not
leave
the
house
during
the
Saturday
and
Sunday
,
and
engaged
herself
exclusively
with
preparing
for
her
journey
.
<EOS>
She
had
no
further
interview
with
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
but
there
were
messages
between
them
,
and
even
notes
were
written
.
<EOS>
They
resulted
in
nothing
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
was
desirous
of
getting
back
the
spoons
and
forks
,
and
,
if
possible
,
some
of
her
money
.
<EOS>
The
spoons
and
forks
were
out
of
Mrs.
Carbuncle
's
power
,
 
in
Albemarle
Street
;
and
the
money
had
of
course
been
spent
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
might
have
saved
herself
the
trouble
,
had
it
not
been
that
it
was
a
pleasure
to
her
to
insult
her
late
friend
,
even
though
in
doing
so
new
insults
were
heaped
upon
her
own
head
.
<EOS>
As
for
the
trumpery
spoons
,
they
,
 
so
said
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
 
were
the
property
of
Miss
Roanoke
,
having
been
made
over
to
her
unconditionally
long
before
the
wedding
,
as
a
part
of
a
separate
pecuniary
transaction
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
had
no
power
of
disposing
of
Miss
Roanoke
's
property
.
<EOS>
As
to
the
money
which
Lady
Eustace
claimed
,
Mrs.
Carbuncle
asserted
that
,
when
the
final
accounts
should
be
made
up
between
them
,
it
would
be
found
that
there
was
a
considerable
balance
due
to
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
<EOS>
But
even
were
there
anything
due
to
Lady
Eustace
,
Mrs.
Carbuncle
would
decline
to
pay
it
,
as
she
was
informed
that
all
moneys
possessed
by
Lady
Eustace
were
now
confiscated
to
the
Crown
by
reason
of
the
PERJURIES
,
 
<EOS>
the
word
was
doubly
scored
in
Mrs.
Carbuncle
's
note
,
 
which
Lady
Eustace
had
committed
.
<EOS>
This
,
of
course
,
was
unpleasant
;
but
Mrs.
Carbuncle
did
not
have
the
honours
of
the
battle
all
to
herself
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
also
said
some
unpleasant
things
,
 
which
,
perhaps
,
were
the
more
unpleasant
because
they
were
true
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
had
come
pretty
nearly
to
the
end
of
her
career
,
whereas
Lizzie
's
income
,
in
spite
of
her
perjuries
,
was
comparatively
untouched
.
<EOS>
The
undoubted
mistress
of
Portray
Castle
,
and
mother
of
the
Sir
Florian
Eustace
of
the
day
,
could
still
despise
and
look
down
upon
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
although
she
were
known
to
have
told
fibs
about
the
family
diamonds
.
  
<EOS>
Lord
George
always
came
to
Hertford
Street
on
a
Sunday
,
and
Lady
Eustace
left
word
for
him
with
the
servant
that
she
would
be
glad
to
see
him
before
her
journey
into
Scotland
.
<EOS>
"
Goes
to
-
morrow
,
does
she
?
"
said
Lord
George
to
the
servant
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
;
I
'll
see
her
.
"
<EOS>
And
he
was
shown
up
to
her
room
before
he
went
to
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
  
<EOS>
Lizzie
,
in
sending
to
him
,
had
some
half
-
formed
idea
of
a
romantic
farewell
.
<EOS>
The
man
,
she
thought
,
had
behaved
very
badly
to
her
,
 
had
accepted
very
much
from
her
hands
,
and
had
refused
to
give
her
anything
in
return
;
had
become
the
first
depository
of
her
great
secret
,
and
had
placed
no
mutual
confidence
in
her
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
harsh
to
her
,
and
unjust
;
and
then
,
too
,
he
had
declined
to
be
in
love
with
her
!
<EOS>
She
was
full
of
spite
against
Lord
George
,
and
would
have
been
glad
to
injure
him
.
<EOS>
But
,
nevertheless
,
there
would
be
some
excitement
in
a
farewell
in
which
some
mock
affection
might
be
displayed
,
and
she
would
have
an
opportunity
of
abusing
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
you
are
off
to
-
morrow
?
"
said
Lord
George
,
taking
his
place
on
the
rug
before
her
fire
,
and
looking
down
at
her
with
his
head
a
little
on
one
side
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
's
anger
against
the
man
chiefly
arose
from
a
feeling
that
he
treated
her
with
all
a
Corsair
's
freedom
without
any
of
a
Corsair
's
tenderness
.
<EOS>
She
could
have
forgiven
the
want
of
deferential
manner
,
had
there
been
any
devotion
;
 
but
Lord
George
was
both
impudent
and
indifferent
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
Thank
goodness
,
I
shall
get
out
of
this
frightful
place
to
-
morrow
,
and
soon
have
once
more
a
roof
of
my
own
over
my
head
.
<EOS>
What
an
experience
I
have
had
since
I
have
been
here
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
have
all
had
an
experience
,
"
said
Lord
George
,
still
looking
at
her
with
that
half
-
comic
turn
of
his
face
,
 
almost
as
though
he
were
investigating
some
curious
animal
of
which
so
remarkable
a
specimen
had
never
before
come
under
his
notice
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
woman
ever
intended
to
show
a
more
disinterested
friendship
than
I
have
done
;
and
what
has
been
my
return
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
mean
to
me
?
 
<EOS>
disinterested
friendship
to
me
?
"
<EOS>
And
Lord
George
tapped
his
breast
lightly
with
his
fingers
.
<EOS>
His
head
was
still
a
little
on
one
side
,
and
there
was
still
the
smile
upon
his
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
alluding
particularly
to
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Lady
Eustace
,
I
can
not
take
charge
of
Mrs.
Carbuncle
's
friendships
.
<EOS>
I
have
enough
to
do
to
look
after
my
own
.
<EOS>
If
you
have
any
complaint
to
make
against
me
,
 
I
will
at
least
listen
to
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
God
knows
I
do
not
want
to
make
complaints
,
"
said
Lizzie
,
covering
her
face
with
her
hands
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
do
n't
do
much
good
;
 
do
they
?
<EOS>
It
's
better
to
take
people
as
you
find
"
em
,
and
then
make
the
best
of
"
em
.
<EOS>
They
're
a
queer
lot
;
 
ai
n't
they
,
 
the
sort
of
people
one
meets
about
in
the
world
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
what
you
mean
by
that
,
Lord
George
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Just
what
you
were
saying
,
when
you
talked
of
your
experiences
.
<EOS>
These
experiences
do
surprise
one
.
<EOS>
I
have
knocked
about
the
world
a
great
deal
,
and
would
have
almost
said
that
nothing
would
surprise
me
.
<EOS>
You
are
no
more
than
a
child
to
me
,
but
you
have
surprised
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
I
have
not
injured
you
,
Lord
George
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
remember
how
you
rode
to
hounds
the
day
your
cousin
took
that
other
man
's
horse
?
<EOS>
That
surprised
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Lord
George
,
that
was
the
happiest
day
of
my
life
.
<EOS>
How
little
happiness
there
is
for
people
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
when
Tewett
got
that
girl
to
say
she
'd
marry
him
,
the
coolness
with
which
you
bore
all
the
abomination
of
it
in
your
house
,
 
for
people
who
were
nothing
to
you
;
 
that
surprised
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
meant
to
be
so
kind
to
you
all
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
when
I
found
that
you
always
travelled
with
ten
thousand
pounds
'
worth
of
diamonds
in
a
box
,
that
surprised
me
very
much
.
<EOS>
I
thought
that
you
were
a
very
dangerous
companion
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Pray
do
n't
talk
about
the
horrid
necklace
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
came
the
robbery
,
and
you
seemed
to
lose
your
diamonds
without
being
at
all
unhappy
about
them
.
<EOS>
Of
course
,
we
understand
that
now
.
"
<EOS>
On
hearing
this
,
Lizzie
smiled
,
but
did
not
say
a
word
.
"
<EOS>
Then
I
perceived
that
I
 
<EOS>
I
was
supposed
to
be
the
thief
.
<EOS>
You
 
you
yourself
could
n't
have
suspected
me
of
taking
the
diamonds
,
because
 
because
you
'd
got
them
,
you
know
,
all
safe
in
your
pocket
.
<EOS>
But
you
might
as
well
own
the
truth
now
.
<EOS>
Did
n't
you
think
that
it
was
I
who
stole
the
box
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
it
had
been
you
,
"
said
Lizzie
laughing
.
  
<EOS>
"
All
that
surprised
me
.
<EOS>
The
police
were
watching
me
every
day
as
a
cat
watches
a
mouse
,
and
thought
that
they
surely
had
got
the
thief
when
they
found
that
I
had
dealings
with
Benjamin
.
<EOS>
Well
;
you
 
you
were
laughing
at
me
in
your
sleeve
all
the
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
laughing
,
Lord
George
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
you
were
.
<EOS>
You
had
got
the
kernel
yourself
,
and
thought
that
I
had
taken
all
the
trouble
to
crack
the
nut
and
had
found
myself
with
nothing
but
the
shell
.
<EOS>
Then
,
when
you
found
you
could
n't
eat
the
kernel
,
that
you
could
n't
get
rid
of
the
swag
without
assistance
,
you
came
to
me
to
help
you
.
<EOS>
I
began
to
think
then
that
you
were
too
many
for
all
of
us
.
<EOS>
By
Jove
,
I
did
!
<EOS>
Then
I
heard
of
the
second
robbery
,
and
,
of
course
,
I
thought
you
had
managed
that
too
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
no
,
"
said
Lizzie
  
<EOS>
"
Unfortunately
you
did
n't
;
<EOS>
but
I
thought
you
did
.
<EOS>
And
you
thought
that
I
had
done
it
!
<EOS>
Mr.
Benjamin
was
too
clever
for
us
both
,
and
now
he
is
going
to
have
penal
servitude
for
the
rest
of
his
life
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
who
will
be
the
better
of
it
all
.
<EOS>
Who
'll
have
the
diamonds
at
last
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
in
the
least
care
.
<EOS>
I
hate
the
diamonds
.
<EOS>
Of
course
I
would
not
give
them
up
,
because
they
were
my
own
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
end
of
it
seems
to
be
that
you
have
lost
your
property
,
and
sworn
ever
so
many
false
oaths
,
and
have
brought
all
your
friends
into
trouble
,
and
have
got
nothing
by
it
.
<EOS>
What
was
the
good
of
being
so
clever
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
need
not
come
here
to
tease
me
,
Lord
George
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
came
here
because
you
sent
for
me
.
<EOS>
There
's
my
poor
friend
,
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
declares
that
all
her
credit
is
destroyed
,
and
her
niece
unable
to
marry
,
and
her
house
taken
away
from
her
,
 
all
because
of
her
connexion
with
you

<EOS>
"
  
"
Mrs.
Carbuncle
is
 
is
 
is
 
Oh
,
Lord
George
,
do
n't
you
know
what
she
is
?
"
  
"
I
know
that
Mrs.
Carbuncle
is
in
a
very
bad
way
,
and
that
that
girl
has
gone
crazy
,
and
that
poor
Griff
has
taken
himself
off
to
Japan
,
and
that
I
am
so
knocked
about
that
I
do
n't
know
where
to
go
;
and
somehow
it
seems
all
to
have
come
from
your
little
manoeuvres
.
<EOS>
You
see
,
we
have
,
all
of
us
,
been
made
remarkable
;
have
n't
we
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
always
remarkable
,
Lord
George
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
it
is
all
your
doing
.
<EOS>
To
be
sure
you
have
lost
your
diamonds
for
your
pains
.
<EOS>
I
would
n't
mind
it
so
much
if
anybody
were
the
better
for
it
.
<EOS>
I
should
n't
have
begrudged
even
Benjamin
the
pull
,
if
he
'd
got
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
stood
there
,
still
looking
down
upon
her
,
speaking
with
a
sarcastic
subrisive
tone
,
and
,
as
she
felt
,
intending
to
be
severe
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
had
sent
for
him
,
and
now
she
did
n't
know
what
to
say
to
him
.
<EOS>
Though
she
believed
that
she
hated
him
,
she
would
have
liked
to
get
up
some
show
of
an
affectionate
farewell
,
some
scene
in
which
there
might
have
been
tears
,
and
tenderness
,
and
poetry
,
 
and
,
perhaps
,
a
parting
caress
.
<EOS>
But
with
his
jeering
words
,
and
sneering
face
,
he
was
as
hard
to
her
as
a
rock
.
<EOS>
He
was
now
silent
,
but
still
looking
down
upon
her
as
he
stood
motionless
upon
the
rug
,
 
so
that
she
was
compelled
to
speak
again
.
<EOS>
"
I
sent
for
you
,
Lord
George
,
because
I
did
not
like
the
idea
of
parting
with
you
for
ever
,
without
one
word
of
adieu
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
going
to
tear
yourself
away
;
 
are
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
going
to
Portray
on
Monday
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
never
coming
back
any
more
?
<EOS>
You
'll
be
up
here
before
the
season
is
over
,
with
fifty
more
wonderful
schemes
in
your
little
head
.
<EOS>
So
Lord
Fawn
is
done
with
,
is
he
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
told
Lord
Fawn
that
nothing
shall
induce
me
ever
to
see
him
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
cousin
Frank
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
cousin
attends
me
down
to
Scotland
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
-
h
.
<EOS>
That
makes
it
altogether
another
thing
.
<EOS>
He
attends
you
down
to
Scotland
;
 
does
he
?
<EOS>
Does
Mr.
Emilius
go
too
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
you
are
trying
to
insult
me
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
ca
n't
expect
but
what
a
man
should
be
a
little
jealous
,
when
he
has
been
so
completely
cut
out
himself
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
time
,
you
know
,
when
even
cousin
Frank
was
n't
a
better
fellow
than
myself
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Much
you
thought
about
it
,
Lord
George
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
;
 
I
did
.
<EOS>
I
thought
about
it
a
good
deal
,
my
lady
.
<EOS>
And
I
liked
the
idea
of
it
very
much
.
"
<EOS>
Lizzie
pricked
up
her
ears
.
<EOS>
In
spite
of
all
his
harshness
,
could
it
be
that
he
should
be
the
Corsair
still
?
<EOS>
"
I
am
a
rambling
,
uneasy
,
ill
-
to
-
do
sort
of
man
;
but
still
I
thought
about
it
.
<EOS>
You
are
pretty
,
you
know
,
 
uncommonly
pretty
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
,
Lord
George
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
'll
acknowledge
that
the
income
goes
for
much
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
that
's
real
at
any
rate
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
;
 
I
hope
so
.
<EOS>
Of
course
it
's
real
.
<EOS>
And
so
is
the
prettiness
,
Lord
George
;
 
if
there
is
any
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
doubted
that
,
Lady
Eustace
.
<EOS>
But
when
it
came
to
my
thinking
that
you
had
stolen
the
diamonds
,
and
you
thinking
that
I
had
stolen
the
box
 
!
<EOS>
I
'm
not
a
man
to
stand
on
trifles
,
but
,
by
George
,
it
would
n't
do
then
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Who
wanted
it
to
do
?
"
said
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
"
Go
away
.
<EOS>
You
are
very
unkind
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
hope
I
may
never
see
you
again
.
<EOS>
I
believe
you
care
more
for
that
odious
vulgar
woman
down
-
stairs
than
you
do
for
anybody
else
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
dear
!
<EOS>
I
have
known
her
for
many
years
,
Lizzie
,
and
that
both
covers
and
discovers
many
faults
.
<EOS>
One
learns
to
know
how
bad
one
's
old
friends
are
,
but
then
one
forgives
them
,
because
they
are
old
friends
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
ca
n't
forgive
me
,
 
because
I
'm
bad
,
and
only
a
new
friend
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
will
.
<EOS>
I
forgive
you
all
,
and
hope
you
may
do
well
yet
.
<EOS>
If
I
may
give
you
one
bit
of
advice
at
parting
,
it
is
to
caution
you
against
being
clever
when
there
is
nothing
to
get
by
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
ai
n't
clever
at
all
,
"
said
Lizzie
,
beginning
to
whimper
.
  
<EOS>
"
Good
-
bye
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Good
-
bye
,
"
said
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
He
took
her
hand
in
one
of
his
;
patted
her
on
the
head
with
the
other
,
as
though
she
had
been
a
child
,
and
then
he
left
her
.
   
<EOS>
Lizzie
Returns
to
Scotland
 
<EOS>
Frank
Greystock
,
the
writer
fears
,
will
not
have
recommended
himself
to
those
readers
of
this
tale
who
think
the
part
of
lover
to
the
heroine
should
be
always
filled
by
a
young
man
with
heroic
attributes
.
<EOS>
And
yet
the
young
member
for
Bobsborough
was
by
no
means
deficient
in
fine
qualities
,
and
perhaps
was
quite
as
capable
of
heroism
as
the
majority
of
barristers
and
members
of
Parliament
among
whom
he
consorted
,
and
who
were
to
him
 
the
world
.
<EOS>
A
man
born
to
great
wealth
may
,
 
without
injury
to
himself
or
friends
,
 
do
pretty
nearly
what
he
likes
in
regard
to
marriage
,
always
presuming
that
the
wife
he
selects
be
of
his
own
rank
.
<EOS>
He
need
not
marry
for
money
,
nor
need
he
abstain
from
marriage
because
he
ca
n't
support
a
wife
without
money
.
<EOS>
And
the
very
poor
man
,
who
has
no
pretension
to
rank
or
standing
,
other
than
that
which
honesty
may
give
him
,
can
do
the
same
.
<EOS>
His
wife
's
fortune
will
consist
in
the
labour
of
her
hands
,
and
in
her
ability
to
assist
him
in
his
home
.
<EOS>
But
between
these
there
is
a
middle
class
of
men
,
who
,
by
reason
of
their
education
,
are
peculiarly
susceptible
to
the
charms
of
womanhood
,
but
who
literally
can
not
marry
for
love
,
because
their
earnings
will
do
no
more
than
support
themselves
.
<EOS>
As
to
this
special
young
man
,
it
must
be
confessed
that
his
earnings
should
have
done
much
more
than
that
;
but
not
the
less
did
he
find
himself
in
a
position
in
which
marriage
with
a
penniless
girl
seemed
to
threaten
him
and
her
with
ruin
.
<EOS>
All
his
friends
told
Frank
Greystock
that
he
would
be
ruined
were
he
to
marry
Lucy
Morris
;
 
and
his
friends
were
people
supposed
to
be
very
good
and
wise
.
<EOS>
The
dean
,
and
the
dean
's
wife
,
his
father
and
mother
,
were
very
clear
that
it
would
be
so
.
<EOS>
Old
Lady
Linlithgow
had
spoken
of
such
a
marriage
as
quite
out
of
the
question
.
<EOS>
The
Bishop
of
Bobsborough
,
when
it
was
mentioned
in
his
hearing
,
had
declared
that
such
a
marriage
would
be
a
thousand
pities
.
<EOS>
And
even
dear
old
Lady
Fawn
,
though
she
wished
it
for
Lucy
's
sake
,
had
many
times
prophesied
that
such
a
thing
was
quite
impossible
.
<EOS>
When
the
rumour
of
the
marriage
reached
Lady
Glencora
,
Lady
Glencora
told
her
friend
,
Madame
Max
Goesler
,
that
that
young
man
was
going
to
blow
his
brains
out
.
<EOS>
To
her
thinking
,
the
two
actions
were
equivalent
.
<EOS>
It
is
only
when
we
read
of
such
men
that
we
feel
that
truth
to
his
sweetheart
is
the
first
duty
of
man
.
<EOS>
I
am
afraid
that
it
is
not
the
advice
which
we
give
to
our
sons
.
  
<EOS>
But
it
was
the
advice
which
Frank
Greystock
had
most
persistently
given
to
himself
since
he
had
first
known
Lucy
Morris
.
<EOS>
Doubtless
he
had
vacillated
,
but
,
on
the
balance
of
his
convictions
as
to
his
own
future
conduct
,
he
had
been
much
nobler
than
his
friends
.
<EOS>
He
had
never
hesitated
for
a
moment
as
to
the
value
of
Lucy
Morris
.
<EOS>
She
was
not
beautiful
.
<EOS>
She
had
no
wonderful
gifts
of
nature
.
<EOS>
There
was
nothing
of
a
goddess
about
her
.
<EOS>
She
was
absolutely
penniless
.
<EOS>
She
had
never
been
what
the
world
calls
well
-
dressed
.
<EOS>
And
yet
she
had
been
everything
to
him
.
<EOS>
There
had
grown
up
a
sympathy
between
them
quite
as
strong
on
his
part
as
on
hers
,
and
he
had
acknowledged
it
to
himself
.
<EOS>
He
had
never
doubted
his
own
love
,
 
and
when
he
had
been
most
near
to
convincing
himself
that
in
his
peculiar
position
he
ought
to
marry
his
rich
cousin
,
because
of
her
wealth
,
then
,
at
those
moments
,
he
had
most
strongly
felt
that
to
have
Lucy
Morris
close
to
him
was
the
greatest
charm
in
existence
.
<EOS>
Hitherto
his
cousin
's
money
,
joined
to
flatteries
and
caresses
,
 
<EOS>
which
,
if
a
young
man
can
resist
,
he
is
almost
more
than
a
young
man
,
 
had
tempted
him
;
but
he
had
combated
the
temptation
.
<EOS>
On
one
memorable
evening
his
love
for
Lucy
had
tempted
him
.
<EOS>
To
that
temptation
he
had
yielded
,
and
the
letter
by
which
he
became
engaged
to
her
had
been
written
.
<EOS>
He
had
never
meant
to
evade
it
;
 
had
always
told
himself
that
it
should
not
be
evaded
;
but
,
gradually
,
days
had
been
added
to
days
,
and
months
to
months
,
and
he
had
allowed
her
to
languish
without
seeing
him
,
and
almost
without
hearing
from
him
.
  
<EOS>
She
,
too
,
had
heard
from
all
sides
that
she
was
deserted
by
him
,
and
she
had
written
to
him
to
give
him
back
his
troth
;
but
she
had
not
sent
her
letters
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
doubt
that
the
thing
was
over
,
 
she
hardly
doubted
.
<EOS>
And
yet
she
would
not
send
any
letter
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
it
would
be
better
that
the
matter
should
be
allowed
to
drop
without
any
letter
-
writing
.
<EOS>
She
would
never
reproach
him
,
 
though
she
would
ever
think
him
to
be
a
traitor
.
<EOS>
Would
not
she
have
starved
herself
for
him
,
could
she
so
have
served
him
?
<EOS>
And
yet
he
could
bear
for
her
sake
no
touch
of
delay
in
his
prosperity
!
<EOS>
Would
she
not
have
been
content
to
wait
,
and
always
to
wait
,
 
so
that
he
with
some
word
of
love
would
have
told
her
that
he
waited
also
?
<EOS>
But
he
would
not
only
desert
her
,
 
but
would
give
himself
to
that
false
,
infamous
woman
,
who
was
so
wholly
unfitted
to
be
his
wife
.
<EOS>
For
Lucy
,
though
to
herself
she
would
call
him
a
traitor
,
 
and
would
think
him
to
be
a
traitor
,
still
regarded
him
as
the
best
of
mankind
,
as
one
who
,
in
marrying
such
a
one
as
Lizzie
Eustace
,
would
destroy
all
his
excellence
,
as
a
man
might
mar
his
strength
and
beauty
by
falling
into
a
pit
.
<EOS>
For
Lizzie
Eustace
Lucy
Morris
had
now
no
forgiveness
.
<EOS>
Lucy
had
almost
forgotten
Lizzie
's
lies
,
and
her
proffered
bribe
,
and
all
her
meanness
,
when
she
made
that
visit
to
Hertford
Street
.
<EOS>
Then
,
when
Lizzie
claimed
this
man
as
her
lover
,
a
full
remembrance
of
all
the
woman
's
iniquities
came
back
on
Lucy
's
mind
.
<EOS>
The
statement
that
Lizzie
then
made
,
Lucy
did
believe
.
<EOS>
She
did
think
that
Frank
,
her
Frank
,
the
man
whom
she
worshipped
,
was
to
take
this
harpy
to
his
bosom
as
his
wife
.
<EOS>
And
if
it
were
to
be
so
,
was
it
not
better
that
she
should
be
so
told
?
<EOS>
But
,
from
that
moment
,
poor
Lizzie
's
sins
were
ranker
to
Lucy
Morris
than
even
to
Mr.
Camperdown
or
Mrs.
Hittaway
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
refrain
from
saying
a
word
even
to
old
Lady
Linlithgow
.
<EOS>
The
countess
had
called
her
niece
a
little
liar
.
"
<EOS>
Liar
!
"
said
Lucy
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
Satan
himself
can
lie
as
she
does
.
"
<EOS>
"
Heighty
-
tighty
,
"
said
the
countess
.
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
,
then
,
there
's
to
be
a
match
between
Lady
Satan
and
her
cousin
Frank
?
"
<EOS>
"
They
can
do
as
they
like
about
that
,
"
said
Lucy
,
walking
out
of
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
Then
came
the
paragraph
in
the
fashionable
evening
newspaper
;
after
that
,
the
report
of
the
examination
before
the
magistrate
,
and
then
certain
information
that
Lady
Eustace
was
about
to
proceed
to
Scotland
together
with
her
cousin
Mr.
Greystock
,
the
Member
for
Bobsborough
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
large
income
,
"
said
the
countess
;
"
but
,
upon
my
word
,
she
's
dear
at
the
money
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Lucy
did
not
speak
,
but
she
bit
her
lip
till
the
blood
ran
into
her
mouth
.
<EOS>
She
was
going
down
to
Fawn
Court
almost
immediately
,
to
stay
there
with
her
old
friends
till
she
should
be
able
to
find
some
permanent
home
for
herself
.
<EOS>
Once
,
and
once
only
,
would
she
endure
discussion
,
and
then
the
matter
should
be
banished
for
ever
from
her
tongue
.
  
<EOS>
Early
on
the
appointed
morning
Frank
Greystock
,
with
a
couple
of
cabs
,
was
at
Mrs.
Carbuncle
's
door
in
Hertford
Street
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
had
agreed
to
start
by
a
very
early
train
,
 
at
eight
a.m.
,
 
so
that
she
might
get
through
to
Portray
in
one
day
.
<EOS>
It
had
been
thought
expedient
,
both
by
herself
and
by
her
cousin
,
that
for
the
present
there
should
be
no
more
sleeping
at
the
Carlisle
hotel
.
<EOS>
The
robbery
was
probably
still
talked
about
in
that
establishment
;
and
the
report
of
the
proceedings
at
the
police
-
court
had
,
no
doubt
,
travelled
as
far
north
as
the
border
city
.
<EOS>
It
was
to
be
a
long
day
,
and
could
hardly
be
other
than
sad
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
,
understanding
this
,
feeling
that
though
she
had
been
in
a
great
measure
triumphant
over
her
difficulties
before
the
magistrate
,
she
ought
still
to
consider
herself
,
for
a
short
while
,
as
being
under
a
cloud
,
crept
down
into
the
cab
and
seated
herself
beside
her
cousin
almost
without
a
word
.
<EOS>
She
was
again
dressed
in
black
,
and
again
wore
the
thick
veil
.
<EOS>
Her
maid
,
with
the
luggage
,
followed
them
,
and
they
were
driven
to
Euston
Square
almost
without
a
word
.
<EOS>
On
this
occasion
no
tall
footman
accompanied
them
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
Frank
;
dear
Frank
,
"
she
had
said
,
and
that
was
all
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
active
about
the
luggage
and
useful
in
giving
orders
;
 
but
beyond
his
directions
and
inquiries
as
to
the
journey
,
he
spoke
not
a
word
.
<EOS>
Had
she
breakfasted
?
<EOS>
Would
she
have
a
cup
of
tea
at
the
station
?
<EOS>
Should
he
take
any
luncheon
for
her
?
<EOS>
At
every
question
she
only
looked
into
his
face
and
shook
her
head
.
<EOS>
All
thoughts
as
to
creature
-
comforts
were
over
with
her
now
for
ever
.
<EOS>
Tranquillity
,
a
little
poetry
,
and
her
darling
boy
,
were
all
that
she
needed
for
the
short
remainder
of
her
sojourn
upon
earth
.
<EOS>
These
were
the
sentiments
which
she
intended
to
convey
when
she
shook
her
head
and
looked
up
into
his
eyes
.
<EOS>
The
world
was
over
for
her
.
<EOS>
She
had
had
her
day
of
pleasure
,
and
found
how
vain
it
was
.
<EOS>
Now
she
would
devote
herself
to
her
child
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
see
my
boy
again
to
-
night
,
"
she
said
,
as
she
took
her
seat
in
the
carriage
.
  
<EOS>
Such
was
the
state
of
mind
,
or
such
,
<EOS>
rather
,
the
resolutions
,
with
which
she
commenced
her
journey
.
<EOS>
Should
he
become
bright
,
communicative
,
and
pleasant
,
or
even
tenderly
silent
,
or
,
perhaps
,
now
at
length
affectionate
and
demonstrative
,
she
,
no
doubt
,
might
be
able
to
change
as
he
changed
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
cousinly
,
but
gloomy
,
at
the
police
-
court
;
in
the
same
mood
when
he
brought
her
home
;
and
,
as
she
saw
with
the
first
glance
of
her
eye
,
in
the
same
mood
again
when
she
met
him
in
the
hall
this
morning
.
<EOS>
Of
course
she
must
play
his
tunes
.
<EOS>
Is
it
not
the
fate
of
women
to
play
the
tunes
which
men
dictate
,
 
except
in
some
rare
case
in
which
the
woman
can
make
herself
the
dictator
?
<EOS>
Lizzie
loved
to
be
a
dictator
;
but
at
the
present
moment
she
knew
that
circumstances
were
against
her
.
  
<EOS>
She
watched
him
,
 
so
closely
.
<EOS>
At
first
he
slept
a
good
deal
.
<EOS>
He
was
never
in
bed
very
early
,
and
on
this
morning
had
been
up
at
six
.
<EOS>
At
Rugby
he
got
out
and
ate
what
he
said
was
his
breakfast
.
<EOS>
Would
not
she
have
a
cup
of
tea
?
<EOS>
Again
she
shook
her
head
and
smiled
.
<EOS>
She
smiled
as
some
women
smile
when
you
offer
them
a
third
glass
of
champagne
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
joking
with
me
,
I
know
.
<EOS>
You
can
not
think
that
I
would
take
it
.
<EOS>
"
That
was
the
meaning
of
Lizzie
's
smile
.
<EOS>
He
went
into
the
refreshment
-
room
,
growled
at
the
heat
of
the
tea
and
the
abominable
nastiness
of
the
food
provided
,
and
then
,
after
the
allotted
five
minutes
,
took
himself
to
a
smoking
-
carriage
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
rejoin
his
cousin
till
they
were
at
Crewe
.
<EOS>
When
he
went
back
to
his
old
seat
,
she
only
smiled
again
.
<EOS>
He
asked
her
whether
she
had
slept
,
and
again
she
shook
her
head
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
repeating
to
herself
the
address
to
Ianthe
's
soul
,
and
her
whole
being
was
pervaded
with
poetry
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
absolutely
necessary
,
as
he
thought
,
that
she
should
eat
something
,
and
he
insisted
that
she
should
dine
upon
the
road
,
somewhere
.
<EOS>
He
,
of
course
,
was
not
aware
that
she
had
been
nibbling
biscuits
and
chocolate
while
he
had
been
smoking
,
and
had
had
recourse
even
to
the
comfort
of
a
sherry
-
flask
which
she
carried
in
her
dressing
-
bag
.
<EOS>
When
he
talked
of
dinner
she
did
more
than
smile
and
refuse
.
<EOS>
She
expostulated
.
<EOS>
For
she
well
knew
that
the
twenty
minutes
for
dinner
were
allowed
at
the
Carlisle
station
;
and
even
if
there
had
been
no
chocolate
and
no
sherry
,
she
would
have
endured
on
,
even
up
to
absolute
inanition
,
rather
than
step
out
upon
this
well
-
remembered
platform
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
eat
,
or
you
'll
be
starved
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
fetch
you
something
.
"
<EOS>
So
he
bribed
a
special
waiter
,
and
she
was
supplied
with
cold
chicken
and
more
sherry
.
<EOS>
After
this
Frank
smoked
again
,
and
did
not
reappear
till
they
had
reached
Dumfries
.
  
<EOS>
Hitherto
there
had
been
no
tenderness
,
 
nothing
but
the
coldest
cousinship
.
<EOS>
He
clearly
meant
her
to
understand
that
he
had
submitted
to
the
task
of
accompanying
her
back
to
Portray
Castle
as
a
duty
,
but
that
he
had
nothing
to
say
to
one
who
had
so
misbehaved
herself
.
<EOS>
This
was
very
irritating
.
<EOS>
She
could
have
taken
herself
home
to
Portray
without
his
company
,
and
have
made
the
journey
more
endurable
without
him
than
with
him
,
if
this
were
to
be
his
conduct
throughout
.
<EOS>
They
had
had
the
carriage
to
themselves
all
the
way
from
Crewe
to
Carlisle
,
and
he
had
hardly
spoken
a
word
to
her
.
<EOS>
If
he
would
have
rated
her
soundly
for
her
wickednesses
,
she
could
have
made
something
of
that
.
<EOS>
She
could
have
thrown
herself
on
her
knees
,
and
implored
his
pardon
;
or
,
if
hard
pressed
,
have
suggested
the
propriety
of
throwing
herself
out
of
the
carriage
-
window
.
<EOS>
She
could
have
brought
him
round
if
he
would
only
have
talked
to
her
,
but
there
is
no
doing
anything
with
a
silent
man
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
her
master
.
<EOS>
He
had
no
power
over
her
.
<EOS>
She
was
the
lady
of
Portray
,
and
he
could
not
interfere
with
her
.
<EOS>
If
he
intended
to
be
sullen
with
her
to
the
end
,
and
to
show
his
contempt
for
her
,
she
would
turn
against
him
.
<EOS>
"
The
worm
will
turn
,
"
she
said
to
herself
.
<EOS>
And
yet
she
did
not
think
herself
a
worm
.
  
<EOS>
A
few
stations
beyond
Dumfries
they
were
again
alone
.
<EOS>
It
was
now
quite
dark
,
and
they
had
already
been
travelling
over
ten
hours
.
<EOS>
They
would
not
reach
their
own
station
till
eight
,
and
then
again
there
would
be
the
journey
to
Portray
.
<EOS>
At
last
he
spoke
to
her
.
"
<EOS>
Are
you
tired
,
Lizzie
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
so
tired
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
slept
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
not
once
;
not
a
wink
.
<EOS>
You
have
slept
.
<EOS>
"
This
she
said
in
a
tone
of
reproach
.
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
I
have
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
endeavoured
to
read
,
but
one
can
not
command
one
's
mind
at
all
times
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
I
am
so
weary
.
<EOS>
Is
it
much
further
?
<EOS>
I
have
lost
all
reckoning
as
to
time
and
place
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
change
at
the
next
station
but
one
.
<EOS>
It
will
soon
be
over
now
.
<EOS>
Will
you
have
a
glass
of
sherry
?
<EOS>
I
have
some
in
my
flask
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Again
she
shook
her
head
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
long
way
down
to
Portray
,
I
must
own
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
am
so
sorry
that
I
have
given
you
the
trouble
to
accompany
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
not
thinking
of
myself
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
mind
it
.
<EOS>
It
was
better
that
you
should
have
somebody
with
you
,
 
just
for
this
journey
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
why
this
journey
should
be
different
from
any
other
,
"
said
Lizzie
crossly
.
<EOS>
She
had
not
done
anything
that
made
it
necessary
that
she
should
be
taken
care
of
,
 
like
a
naughty
girl
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
see
you
to
the
end
of
it
now
,
anyway
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
'll
stay
a
few
days
with
me
,
Frank
?
<EOS>
You
wo
n't
go
away
at
once
?
<EOS>
Say
you
'll
stay
a
week
.
<EOS>
Dear
,
dear
Frank
;
say
you
'll
stay
a
week
.
<EOS>
I
know
that
the
House
does
n't
meet
for
ever
so
long
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
Frank
,
I
do
so
wish
you
'd
be
more
like
yourself
.
<EOS>
"
There
was
no
reason
why
she
should
not
make
one
other
effort
,
and
as
she
made
it
every
sign
of
fatigue
passed
away
from
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
stay
over
to
-
morrow
certainly
,
"
he
replied
.
  
<EOS>
"
Only
one
day
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Days
with
me
mean
money
,
Lizzie
,
and
money
is
a
thing
which
is
at
present
very
necessary
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hate
money
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
very
well
for
you
,
because
you
have
plenty
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hate
money
.
<EOS>
It
is
the
only
thing
that
one
has
that
one
can
not
give
to
those
one
loves
.
<EOS>
I
could
give
you
anything
else
;
 
though
it
cost
a
thousand
pounds
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Pray
do
n't
.
<EOS>
Most
people
like
presents
,
but
they
only
bore
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Because
you
are
so
indifferent
,
Frank
;
 
so
cold
.
<EOS>
Do
you
remember
giving
me
a
little
ring
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Very
well
indeed
.
<EOS>
It
cost
eight
and
sixpence
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
thought
what
it
cost
;
 
but
there
it
is
.
<EOS>
"
This
she
said
,
drawing
off
her
glove
and
showing
him
her
finger
.
"
<EOS>
And
when
I
am
dead
,
there
it
will
be
.
<EOS>
You
say
you
want
money
,
Frank
.
<EOS>
May
I
not
give
it
you
?
<EOS>
Are
not
we
brother
and
sister
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Lizzie
,
you
say
you
hate
money
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
talk
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
you
that
talk
about
it
.
<EOS>
I
only
talk
about
it
because
I
want
to
give
it
you
;
 
yes
,
all
that
I
have
.
<EOS>
When
I
first
knew
what
was
the
real
meaning
of
my
husband
's
will
,
my
only
thought
was
to
be
of
assistance
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
In
real
truth
Frank
was
becoming
very
sick
of
her
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
to
him
now
to
have
been
almost
impossible
that
he
should
ever
soberly
have
thought
of
making
her
his
wife
.
<EOS>
The
charm
was
all
gone
,
and
even
her
prettiness
had
in
his
eyes
lost
its
value
.
<EOS>
He
looked
at
her
,
asking
himself
whether
in
truth
she
was
pretty
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
travelling
all
day
,
and
perhaps
the
scrutiny
was
not
fair
.
<EOS>
But
he
thought
that
even
after
the
longest
day
's
journey
Lucy
would
not
have
been
soiled
,
haggard
,
dishevelled
,
and
unclean
,
as
was
this
woman
.
  
<EOS>
Travellers
again
entered
the
carriage
,
and
they
went
on
with
a
crowd
of
persons
till
they
reached
the
platform
at
which
they
changed
the
carriage
for
Troon
.
<EOS>
Then
they
were
again
alone
,
for
a
few
minutes
,
and
Lizzie
with
infinite
courage
determined
that
she
would
make
her
last
attempt
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Frank
,
"
she
said
,
"
you
know
what
it
is
that
I
mean
.
<EOS>
You
can
not
feel
that
I
am
ungenerous
.
<EOS>
You
have
made
me
love
you
.
<EOS>
Will
you
have
all
that
I
have
to
give
?
<EOS>
"
She
was
leaning
over
,
close
to
him
,
and
he
was
observing
that
her
long
lock
of
hair
was
out
of
curl
and
untidy
,
 
a
thing
that
ought
not
to
have
been
there
during
such
a
journey
as
this
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
not
know
,
"
he
said
,
"
that
I
am
engaged
to
marry
Lucy
Morris
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
 
I
do
not
know
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
told
you
so
more
than
once
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
can
not
afford
to
marry
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
I
shall
do
it
without
affording
.
<EOS>
"
Lizzie
was
about
to
speak
,
 
had
already
pronounced
her
rival
's
name
in
that
tone
of
contempt
which
she
so
well
knew
how
to
use
,
when
he
stopped
her
.
"
Do
not
say
anything
against
her
,
Lizzie
,
in
my
hearing
,
for
I
will
not
bear
it
.
<EOS>
It
would
force
me
to
leave
you
at
the
Troon
station
,
and
I
had
better
see
you
now
to
the
end
of
the
journey
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Lizzie
flung
herself
back
into
the
corner
of
her
carriage
,
and
did
not
utter
another
word
till
she
reached
Portray
Castle
.
<EOS>
He
handed
her
out
of
the
railway
carriage
,
and
into
her
own
vehicle
which
was
waiting
for
them
,
attended
to
the
maid
,
and
got
the
luggage
;
but
still
she
did
not
speak
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
better
that
she
should
quarrel
with
him
.
<EOS>
That
little
snake
,
Lucy
,
would
of
course
now
tell
him
of
the
meeting
between
them
in
Hertford
Street
,
after
which
anything
but
quarrelling
would
be
impossible
.
<EOS>
What
a
fool
the
man
must
be
,
what
an
idiot
,
what
a
soft
-
hearted
,
mean
-
spirited
fellow
!
<EOS>
Lucy
,
by
her
sly
,
quiet
little
stratagems
,
had
got
him
once
to
speak
the
word
,
and
now
he
had
not
courage
enough
to
go
back
from
it
!
<EOS>
He
had
less
strength
of
will
even
than
Lord
Fawn
!
<EOS>
What
she
offered
to
him
would
be
the
making
of
him
.
<EOS>
With
his
position
,
his
seat
in
Parliament
,
such
a
country
house
as
Portray
Castle
,
and
the
income
which
she
would
give
him
,
there
was
nothing
that
he
might
not
reach
!
<EOS>
And
he
was
so
infirm
of
purpose
,
that
though
he
had
hankered
after
it
all
,
he
would
not
open
his
hand
to
take
it
,
 
because
he
was
afraid
of
such
a
little
thing
as
Lucy
Morris
!
<EOS>
It
was
thus
that
she
thought
of
him
as
she
leaned
back
in
the
carriage
without
speaking
.
<EOS>
In
giving
her
all
that
is
due
to
her
,
we
must
acknowledge
that
she
had
less
feeling
of
the
injury
done
to
her
charms
as
a
woman
than
might
have
been
expected
.
<EOS>
That
she
hated
Lucy
was
a
matter
of
course
;
 
and
equally
so
that
she
should
be
very
angry
with
Frank
Greystock
.
<EOS>
But
the
anger
arose
from
general
disappointment
,
rather
than
from
any
sense
of
her
own
despised
beauty
.
"
<EOS>
Ah
,
now
I
shall
see
my
child
,
"
she
said
,
as
the
carriage
stopped
at
the
castle
-
gate
.
  
<EOS>
When
Frank
Greystock
went
to
his
supper
,
Miss
Macnulty
brought
to
him
his
cousin
's
compliments
with
a
message
saying
that
she
was
too
weary
to
see
him
again
that
night
.
<EOS>
The
message
had
been
intended
to
be
curt
and
uncourteous
,
but
Miss
Macnulty
had
softened
it
,
 
so
that
no
harm
was
done
.
<EOS>
"
She
must
be
very
weary
,
"
said
Frank
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
though
that
nothing
would
ever
really
tire
Lady
Eustace
,
"
said
Miss
Macnulty
.
<EOS>
"
When
she
is
excited
nothing
will
tire
her
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
the
journey
has
been
dull
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Exceedingly
dull
,
"
said
Frank
,
as
he
helped
himself
to
the
collops
which
the
Portray
cook
had
prepared
for
his
supper
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Macnulty
was
very
attentive
to
him
,
and
had
many
questions
to
ask
.
<EOS>
About
the
necklace
she
hardly
dared
to
speak
,
merely
observing
how
sad
it
was
that
all
those
precious
diamonds
should
have
been
lost
for
ever
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Very
sad
indeed
,
"
said
Frank
with
his
mouth
full
.
<EOS>
She
then
went
on
to
the
marriage
,
 
the
marriage
that
was
no
marriage
.
<EOS>
Was
not
that
very
dreadful
?
<EOS>
Was
it
true
that
Miss
Roanoke
was
really
 
out
of
her
mind
?
<EOS>
Frank
acknowledged
that
it
was
dreadful
,
but
thought
that
the
marriage
had
it
been
completed
would
have
been
more
so
.
<EOS>
As
for
the
young
lady
,
he
only
knew
that
she
had
been
taken
somewhere
out
of
the
way
.
<EOS>
Sir
Griffin
,
he
had
been
told
,
had
gone
to
Japan
.
  
<EOS>
"
To
Japan
!
"
said
Miss
Macnulty
,
really
interested
.
<EOS>
Had
Sir
Griffin
gone
no
further
than
Boulogne
,
her
pleasure
in
the
news
would
certainly
have
been
much
less
.
<EOS>
Then
she
asked
some
single
question
about
Lord
George
,
and
from
that
came
to
the
real
marrow
of
her
anxiety
.
<EOS>
Had
Mr.
Greystock
lately
seen
the
 
the
Rev.
Mr.
Emilius
?
<EOS>
Frank
had
not
seen
the
clergyman
,
and
could
only
say
of
him
that
had
Lucinda
Roanoke
and
Sir
Griffin
Tewett
been
made
one
,
the
knot
would
have
been
tied
by
Mr.
Emilius
.
  
<EOS>
"
Would
it
indeed
?
<EOS>
Did
you
not
think
Mr.
Emilius
very
clever
when
you
met
him
down
here
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
doubt
but
<EOS>
what
he
is
a
sharp
sort
of
fellow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Mr.
Greystock
,
I
do
n't
think
that
that
's
the
word
for
him
at
all
.
<EOS>
He
did
promise
me
when
he
was
here
that
he
would
write
to
me
occasionally
,
but
I
suppose
that
the
increasing
duties
of
his
position
have
rendered
that
impossible
.
"
<EOS>
Frank
,
who
had
no
idea
of
the
extent
of
the
preacher
's
ambition
,
assured
Miss
Macnulty
that
among
his
multifarious
clerical
labours
it
was
out
of
the
question
that
Mr.
Emilius
should
find
time
to
write
letters
.
  
<EOS>
Frank
had
consented
to
stay
one
day
at
Portray
,
and
did
not
now
like
to
run
away
without
again
seeing
his
cousin
.
<EOS>
Though
much
tempted
to
go
at
once
,
he
did
stay
the
day
,
and
had
an
opportunity
of
speaking
a
few
words
to
Mr.
Gowran
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Gowran
was
very
gracious
,
but
said
nothing
of
his
journey
up
to
London
.
<EOS>
He
asked
various
questions
concerning
her
"
leddyship
's
"
appearance
at
the
police
-
court
,
as
to
which
tidings
had
already
reached
Ayrshire
,
and
pretended
to
be
greatly
shocked
at
the
loss
of
the
diamonds
.
<EOS>
"
When
they
talk
o
'
ten
thoosand
poond
,
that
's
a
lee
,
nae
doobt
?
"
asked
Andy
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
lie
at
all
,
I
believe
,
"
said
Greystock
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
her
leddyship
wad
tak
'
aboot
wi
'
her
ten
thoosand
poond
 
in
a
box
?
"
<EOS>
Andy
still
showed
much
doubt
by
the
angry
glance
of
his
eye
and
the
close
compression
of
his
lips
,
and
the
great
severity
of
his
demeanour
as
he
asked
the
question
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
nothing
about
diamonds
myself
,
but
that
is
what
they
say
they
were
worth
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Her
leddyship
's
her
ain
sell
seems
nae
to
ha
"
been
in
ain
story
aboot
the
box
,
Muster
Greystock
?
"
<EOS>
But
Frank
could
not
stand
to
be
cross
-
questioned
on
this
delicate
matter
,
and
walked
off
,
saying
that
as
the
thieves
had
not
yet
been
tried
for
the
robbery
,
the
less
said
about
it
the
better
.
  
<EOS>
At
four
o'clock
on
that
afternoon
he
had
not
seen
Lizzie
,
and
then
he
received
a
message
from
her
to
the
effect
that
she
was
still
so
unwell
from
the
fatigue
of
her
journey
that
she
could
bear
no
one
with
her
but
her
child
.
<EOS>
She
hoped
that
her
cousin
was
quite
comfortable
,
and
that
she
might
be
able
to
see
him
after
breakfast
on
the
following
day
.
<EOS>
But
Frank
was
determined
to
leave
Portray
very
early
on
the
following
day
,
and
therefore
wrote
a
note
to
his
cousin
.
<EOS>
He
begged
that
she
would
not
disturb
herself
,
that
he
would
leave
the
castle
the
next
morning
before
she
could
be
up
,
and
that
he
had
only
further
to
remind
her
that
she
must
come
up
to
London
at
once
as
soon
as
she
should
be
summoned
for
the
trial
of
Mr.
Benjamin
and
his
comrade
.
<EOS>
It
had
seemed
to
Frank
that
she
had
almost
concluded
that
her
labours
connected
with
that
disagreeable
matter
were
at
an
end
.
<EOS>
"
The
examination
may
be
long
,
and
I
will
attend
you
if
you
wish
it
,
"
said
her
cousin
.
<EOS>
Upon
receiving
this
she
thought
it
expedient
to
come
down
to
him
,
and
there
was
an
interview
for
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
in
her
own
little
sitting
-
room
looking
out
upon
the
sea
.
<EOS>
She
had
formed
a
project
,
and
at
once
suggested
it
to
him
.
<EOS>
If
she
found
herself
ill
when
the
day
of
the
trial
came
,
could
they
make
her
go
up
and
give
her
evidence
?
<EOS>
Frank
told
her
that
they
could
,
and
that
they
would
.
<EOS>
She
was
very
clever
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
They
could
n't
go
back
to
what
I
said
at
Carlisle
,
you
know
;
because
they
already
have
made
me
tell
all
that
myself
.
"
<EOS>
As
she
had
been
called
upon
to
criminate
herself
,
she
could
not
now
be
tried
for
the
crime
.
<EOS>
Frank
,
however
,
would
not
listen
to
this
,
and
told
her
that
she
must
come
.
"
<EOS>
Very
well
,
Frank
.
<EOS>
I
know
you
like
to
have
your
own
way
.
<EOS>
You
always
did
.
<EOS>
And
you
think
so
little
of
my
feelings
!
<EOS>
I
shall
make
inquiry
,
and
if
I
must
,
 
why
I
suppose
I
must
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
'd
better
make
up
your
mind
to
come
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
well
.
<EOS>
And
now
,
Frank
,
as
I
am
so
very
tired
,
if
you
please
<EOS>
I
'll
say
good
-
bye
to
you
.
<EOS>
I
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
for
coming
with
me
.
<EOS>
Good
-
bye
.
"
<EOS>
And
so
they
parted
.
   
<EOS>
The
Story
of
Lucy
Morris
Is
Concluded
 
<EOS>
On
the
day
appointed
,
Lucy
Morris
went
back
from
the
house
of
the
old
countess
to
Fawn
Court
.
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
"
said
Lady
Linlithgow
,
"
I
am
sorry
that
you
are
going
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
you
'll
think
I
have
n't
been
very
kind
to
you
,
but
I
never
am
kind
.
<EOS>
People
have
always
been
hard
to
me
,
and
I
'm
hard
.
<EOS>
But
I
do
like
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
glad
you
like
me
,
as
we
have
lived
together
so
long
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
may
go
on
staying
here
,
if
you
choose
,
and
I
'll
try
to
make
it
better
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
has
n't
been
bad
at
all
,
 
only
that
there
's
nothing
particular
to
do
.
<EOS>
But
I
must
go
.
<EOS>
I
shall
get
another
place
as
a
governess
somewhere
,
and
that
will
suit
me
best
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Because
of
the
money
,
you
mean
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Well
;
 
that
in
part
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
mean
to
pay
you
something
,
"
said
the
countess
,
opening
her
pocket
-
book
,
and
fumbling
for
two
bank
-
notes
which
she
had
deposited
there
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
dear
,
no
.
<EOS>
I
have
n't
earned
anything
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
always
gave
Macnulty
something
,
and
she
was
not
near
so
nice
as
you
.
"
<EOS>
And
then
the
countess
produced
two
ten
-
pound
notes
.
<EOS>
But
Lucy
would
have
none
of
her
money
,
and
when
she
was
pressed
,
became
proud
and
almost
indignant
in
her
denial
.
<EOS>
She
had
earned
nothing
,
and
she
would
take
nothing
;
and
it
was
in
vain
that
the
old
lady
spread
the
clean
bits
of
paper
before
her
.
"
<EOS>
And
so
you
'll
go
and
be
a
governess
again
;
will
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
When
I
can
get
a
place
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
tell
you
what
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
If
I
were
Frank
Greystock
,
I
'd
stick
to
my
bargain
.
<EOS>
"
Lucy
at
once
fell
a
-
crying
,
but
she
smiled
upon
the
old
woman
through
her
tears
.
<EOS>
"
Of
course
he
's
going
to
marry
that
little
limb
of
the
devil
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Lady
Linlithgow
,
 
if
you
can
,
prevent
that
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
am
I
to
prevent
it
,
my
dear
?
<EOS>
I
've
nothing
to
say
to
either
of
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
n't
for
myself
I
'm
speaking
.
<EOS>
If
I
ca
n't
 
if
I
ca
n't
 
ca
n't
have
things
go
as
I
thought
they
would
by
myself
,
I
will
never
ask
any
one
to
help
me
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
that
I
mean
.
<EOS>
I
have
given
all
that
up
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
given
it
up
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
 
I
have
.
<EOS>
But
nevertheless
I
think
of
him
.
<EOS>
She
is
bad
,
and
he
will
never
be
happy
if
he
marries
her
.
<EOS>
When
he
asked
me
to
be
his
wife
,
he
was
mistaken
as
to
what
would
be
good
for
him
.
<EOS>
He
ought
not
to
have
made
such
a
mistake
.
<EOS>
For
my
sake
he
ought
not
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
quite
true
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
do
not
wish
him
to
be
unhappy
all
his
life
.
<EOS>
He
is
not
bad
,
but
she
is
very
bad
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
for
worlds
that
anybody
should
tell
him
that
he
owed
me
anything
;
but
if
he
could
be
saved
from
her
,
 
<EOS>
oh
,
I
should
be
so
-
glad
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
wo
n't
have
my
money
,
then
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
No
,
 
Lady
Linlithgow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
'd
better
.
<EOS>
It
is
honestly
your
own
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
take
it
,
thank
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
I
may
as
well
put
it
up
again
.
"
<EOS>
And
the
countess
replaced
the
notes
in
her
pocket
-
book
.
<EOS>
When
this
conversation
took
place
,
Frank
Greystock
was
travelling
back
alone
from
Portray
to
London
.
<EOS>
On
the
same
day
the
Fawn
carriage
came
to
fetch
Lucy
away
.
<EOS>
As
Lucy
was
in
peculiar
distress
,
Lady
Fawn
would
not
allow
her
to
come
by
any
other
conveyance
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
exactly
think
that
the
carriage
would
console
her
poor
favourite
;
but
she
did
it
as
she
would
have
ordered
something
specially
nice
to
eat
for
any
one
who
had
broken
his
leg
.
<EOS>
Her
soft
heart
had
compassion
for
misery
,
though
she
would
sometimes
show
her
sympathy
by
strange
expressions
.
<EOS>
Lady
Linlithgow
was
almost
angry
about
the
carriage
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
How
many
carriages
and
<EOS>
how
many
horses
does
Lady
Fawn
keep
?
"
<EOS>
she
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
One
carriage
and
two
horses
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
's
very
fond
of
sending
them
up
into
the
streets
of
London
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Lucy
said
nothing
more
,
knowing
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
soften
the
heart
of
this
dowager
in
regard
to
the
other
.
<EOS>
But
she
kissed
the
old
woman
at
parting
,
and
then
was
taken
down
to
Richmond
in
state
.
  
<EOS>
She
had
made
up
her
mind
to
have
one
discussion
with
Lady
Fawn
about
her
engagement
,
 
the
engagement
which
was
no
longer
an
engagement
,
 
and
then
to
have
done
with
it
.
<EOS>
She
would
ask
Lady
Fawn
to
ask
the
girls
never
to
mention
Mr.
Greystock
's
name
in
her
hearing
.
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
had
also
made
up
her
mind
to
the
same
effect
.
<EOS>
She
felt
that
the
subject
should
be
mentioned
once
,
 
and
once
only
.
<EOS>
Of
course
Lucy
must
have
another
place
,
but
there
need
be
no
hurry
about
that
.
<EOS>
She
fully
recognised
her
young
friend
's
feeling
of
independence
,
and
was
herself
aware
that
she
would
be
wrong
to
offer
to
the
girl
a
permanent
home
among
her
own
daughters
,
and
therefore
she
could
not
abandon
the
idea
of
a
future
place
;
but
Lucy
would
,
of
course
,
remain
till
a
situation
should
have
been
found
for
her
that
would
be
in
every
sense
unexceptionable
.
<EOS>
There
need
,
however
,
be
no
haste
,
 
and
,
in
the
meantime
,
the
few
words
about
Frank
Greystock
must
be
spoken
.
<EOS>
They
need
not
,
however
,
be
spoken
quite
immediately
.
<EOS>
Let
there
be
smiles
,
and
joy
,
and
a
merry
ring
of
laughter
on
this
the
first
day
of
the
return
of
their
old
friend
.
<EOS>
As
Lucy
had
the
same
feelings
on
that
afternoon
,
they
did
talk
pleasantly
and
were
merry
.
<EOS>
The
girls
asked
questions
about
the
Vulturess
,
 
as
they
had
heard
her
called
by
Lizzie
Eustace
,
 
and
laughed
at
Lucy
to
her
face
when
she
swore
that
,
after
a
fashion
,
she
liked
the
old
woman
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
'd
like
anybody
,
then
,
"
said
Nina
.
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
I
do
n't
,
"
said
Lucy
,
thinking
at
once
of
Lizzie
Eustace
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
planned
out
the
next
day
with
great
precision
.
<EOS>
After
breakfast
,
Lucy
and
the
girls
were
to
spend
the
morning
in
the
old
school
-
room
,
so
that
there
might
be
a
general
explanation
as
to
the
doings
of
the
last
six
months
.
<EOS>
They
were
to
dine
at
three
,
and
after
dinner
there
should
be
the
discussion
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Will
you
come
up
to
my
room
at
four
o'clock
,
my
dear
?
"
said
Lady
Fawn
,
patting
Lucy
's
shoulder
,
in
the
breakfast
-
parlour
.
<EOS>
Lucy
knew
well
why
her
presence
was
required
.
<EOS>
Of
course
she
would
come
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
wise
to
get
it
over
and
have
done
with
it
.
  
<EOS>
At
noon
Lady
Fawn
,
with
her
three
eldest
daughters
,
went
out
in
the
carriage
,
and
Lucy
was
busy
among
the
others
with
books
and
maps
and
sheets
of
scribbled
music
.
<EOS>
Nothing
was
done
on
that
day
in
the
way
of
instruction
;
but
there
was
much
of
half
-
jocose
acknowledgement
of
past
idleness
,
and
a
profusion
of
resolutions
of
future
diligence
.
<EOS>
One
or
two
of
the
girls
were
going
to
commence
a
course
of
reading
that
would
have
broken
the
back
of
any
professor
,
and
suggestions
were
made
as
to
very
rigid
rules
as
to
the
talking
of
French
and
German
.
"
<EOS>
But
as
we
ca
n't
talk
German
,
"
said
Nina
,
"
we
should
simply
be
dumb
.
"
<EOS>
"
You
'd
talk
High
Dutch
,
Nina
,
sooner
than
submit
to
that
,
"
said
one
of
the
sisters
.
  
<EOS>
The
conclave
was
still
sitting
in
full
deliberation
,
when
one
of
the
maids
entered
the
room
with
a
very
long
face
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
gentleman
in
the
drawing
-
room
asking
for
Miss
Morris
!
<EOS>
Lucy
,
who
at
the
moment
was
standing
at
a
table
on
which
were
spread
an
infinity
of
books
,
became
at
once
as
white
as
a
sheet
.
<EOS>
Her
fast
friend
,
Lydia
Fawn
,
who
was
standing
by
her
,
immediately
took
hold
of
her
hand
quite
tightly
.
<EOS>
The
face
of
the
maid
was
fit
for
a
funeral
.
<EOS>
She
knew
that
Miss
Morris
had
had
a
"
follower
,
"
 
that
the
follower
had
come
,
 
and
that
then
Miss
Morris
had
gone
away
.
<EOS>
Miss
Morris
had
been
allowed
to
come
back
;
and
now
,
on
the
very
first
day
,
just
when
my
lady
's
back
was
turned
,
here
was
the
follower
again
!
<EOS>
Before
she
had
come
up
with
her
message
,
there
had
been
an
unanimous
expression
of
opinion
in
the
kitchen
that
the
fat
would
all
be
in
the
fire
.
<EOS>
Lucy
was
as
white
as
marble
,
and
felt
such
a
sudden
shock
at
her
heart
,
that
she
could
not
speak
.
<EOS>
And
yet
she
never
doubted
for
a
moment
that
Frank
Greystock
was
the
man
.
<EOS>
And
with
what
purpose
but
one
could
he
have
come
there
?
<EOS>
She
had
on
the
old
,
old
frock
in
which
,
before
her
visit
to
Lady
Linlithgow
,
she
used
to
pass
the
morning
amidst
her
labours
with
the
girls
,
 
a
pale
,
grey
,
well
-
worn
frock
,
to
which
must
have
been
imparted
some
attraction
from
the
milliner
's
art
,
because
everybody
liked
it
so
well
,
 
but
which
she
had
put
on
this
very
morning
as
a
testimony
,
to
all
the
world
around
her
,
that
she
had
abandoned
the
idea
of
being
anything
except
a
governess
.
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
had
understood
the
frock
well
.
<EOS>
"
Here
is
the
dear
little
old
woman
just
the
same
as
ever
,
"
Lydia
had
said
,
embracing
her
.
"
<EOS>
She
looks
as
if
she
'd
gone
to
bed
before
the
winter
,
and
had
a
long
sleep
,
like
a
dormouse
,
"
said
Cecilia
.
<EOS>
Lucy
had
liked
it
all
,
and
thoroughly
appreciated
the
loving
-
kindness
;
but
she
had
known
what
it
all
meant
.
<EOS>
She
had
left
them
as
the
engaged
bride
of
Mr.
Greystock
,
the
member
for
Bobsborough
;
and
now
she
had
come
back
as
Lucy
Morris
,
the
governess
,
again
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Just
the
same
as
ever
,
"
Lucy
had
said
,
with
the
sweetest
smile
.
<EOS>
They
all
understood
that
,
in
so
saying
,
she
renounced
her
lover
.
  
<EOS>
And
now
there
stood
the
maid
,
inside
the
room
,
who
,
having
announced
that
there
was
a
gentleman
asking
for
Miss
Morris
,
was
waiting
for
an
answer
.
<EOS>
Was
the
follower
to
be
sent
about
his
business
,
with
a
flea
in
his
ear
,
having
come
,
slyly
,
craftily
,
and
wickedly
,
in
Lady
Fawn
's
absence
;
or
would
Miss
Morris
brazen
it
out
,
and
go
and
see
him
?
  
<EOS>
"
Who
is
the
gentleman
?
"
asked
Diana
,
who
was
the
eldest
of
the
Fawn
girls
present
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
he
as
used
to
come
after
Miss
Morris
before
,
"
said
the
maid
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
Mr.
Greystock
,
"
said
Lucy
,
recovering
herself
with
an
effort
.
<EOS>
"
I
had
better
go
down
to
him
.
<EOS>
Will
you
tell
him
,
Mary
,
that
I
'll
be
with
him
almost
immediately
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
ought
to
have
put
on
the
other
frock
,
after
all
,
"
said
Nina
,
whispering
into
her
ear
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
has
not
lost
much
time
in
coming
to
see
you
,
"
said
Lydia
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
it
was
all
because
he
did
n't
like
Lady
Linlithgow
,
"
said
Cecilia
.
<EOS>
Lucy
had
not
a
word
to
say
.
<EOS>
She
stood
for
a
minute
among
them
,
trying
to
think
,
and
then
she
slowly
left
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
She
would
not
condescend
to
alter
her
dress
by
the
aid
of
a
single
pin
,
or
by
the
adjustment
of
a
ribbon
.
<EOS>
It
might
well
be
that
,
after
the
mingled
work
and
play
of
the
morning
,
her
hair
should
not
be
smooth
;
but
she
was
too
proud
to
look
at
her
hair
.
<EOS>
The
man
whom
she
had
loved
,
who
had
loved
her
but
had
neglected
her
,
was
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
He
would
surely
not
have
followed
her
thither
<EOS>
did
he
not
intend
to
make
reparation
for
his
neglect
.
<EOS>
But
she
would
use
no
art
with
him
;
 
nor
would
she
make
any
entreaty
.
<EOS>
It
might
be
that
,
after
all
,
he
had
the
courage
to
come
and
tell
her
,
in
a
manly
,
straightforward
way
,
that
the
thing
must
be
all
over
,
 
that
he
had
made
a
mistake
,
and
would
beg
her
pardon
.
<EOS>
If
it
were
so
,
there
should
be
no
word
of
reproach
.
<EOS>
She
would
be
quite
quiet
with
him
;
but
there
should
be
no
word
of
reproach
.
<EOS>
But
if
 
In
that
other
case
she
could
not
be
sure
of
her
behaviour
,
but
she
knew
well
that
he
would
not
have
to
ask
long
for
forgiveness
.
<EOS>
As
for
her
dress
,
 
he
had
chosen
to
love
her
in
that
frock
before
,
and
she
did
not
think
that
he
would
pay
much
attention
to
her
dress
on
the
present
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
She
opened
the
door
very
quietly
and
very
slowly
,
intending
to
approach
him
in
the
same
way
.
<EOS>
But
in
a
moment
,
before
she
could
remember
that
she
was
in
the
room
,
he
had
seized
her
in
his
arms
,
and
was
showering
kisses
upon
her
forehead
,
her
eyes
,
and
her
lips
.
<EOS>
When
she
thought
of
it
afterwards
,
she
could
not
call
to
mind
a
single
word
that
he
had
spoken
before
he
held
her
in
his
embrace
.
<EOS>
It
was
she
,
surely
,
who
had
spoken
first
,
when
she
begged
to
be
released
from
his
pressure
.
<EOS>
But
she
well
remembered
the
first
words
that
struck
her
ear
.
"
<EOS>
Dearest
Lucy
,
will
you
forgive
me
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
could
only
answer
them
through
her
tears
by
taking
up
his
hand
and
kissing
it
.
  
<EOS>
When
Lady
Fawn
came
back
with
the
carriage
,
she
herself
saw
the
figures
of
two
persons
,
walking
very
close
together
,
in
the
shrubberies
.
<EOS>
"
Is
that
Lucy
?
"
<EOS>
she
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Augusta
,
with
a
tone
of
horror
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Indeed
it
is
,
and
 
Mr.
Greystock
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
was
neither
shocked
nor
displeased
;
nor
was
she
disappointed
;
but
a
certain
faint
feeling
of
being
ill
-
used
by
circumstances
came
over
her
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Dear
me
;
 
the
very
first
day
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
because
he
would
n't
go
to
Lady
Linlithgow
's
,
"
said
Amelia
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
has
only
waited
,
mamma
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
the
very
first
day
!
"
exclaimed
Lady
Fawn
.
<EOS>
"
I
hope
Lucy
will
be
happy
;
 
that
's
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
great
meeting
of
all
the
Fawns
,
as
soon
as
Lady
Fawn
and
the
eldest
girls
were
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Greystock
had
been
walking
about
the
grounds
with
Lucy
for
the
last
hour
and
a
half
.
<EOS>
Lucy
had
come
in
once
to
beg
that
Lady
Fawn
might
be
told
directly
she
came
in
.
"
<EOS>
She
said
you
were
to
send
for
her
,
mamma
,
"
said
Lydia
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
it
's
dinner
-
time
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
What
are
we
to
do
with
Mr.
Greystock
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ask
him
to
lunch
,
of
course
,
"
said
Amelia
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
it
's
all
right
,
"
said
Lady
Fawn
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
quite
sure
it
's
all
right
,
"
said
Nina
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
did
she
say
to
you
,
Lydia
?
"
asked
the
mother
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
was
as
happy
as
ever
<EOS>
she
could
be
,
"
said
Lydia
.
<EOS>
"
There
's
no
doubt
about
its
being
all
right
,
mamma
.
<EOS>
She
looked
just
as
she
did
when
she
got
the
letter
from
him
before
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
she
managed
to
change
her
frock
,
"
said
Augusta
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
did
n't
then
,
"
said
Cecilia
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
suppose
he
cares
one
halfpenny
about
her
frock
,
"
said
Nina
.
<EOS>
"
I
should
never
think
about
a
man
's
coat
if
I
was
in
love
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nina
,
you
should
n't
talk
in
that
way
,
"
said
Augusta
.
<EOS>
Whereupon
Nina
made
a
face
behind
one
of
her
sisters
"
backs
.
<EOS>
Poor
Augusta
was
never
allowed
to
be
a
prophetess
among
them
.
  
<EOS>
The
consultation
was
ended
by
a
decision
in
accordance
with
which
Nina
went
as
an
ambassador
to
the
lovers
.
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
sent
her
compliments
to
Mr.
Greystock
,
and
hoped
he
would
come
in
to
lunch
.
<EOS>
Lucy
must
come
in
to
dinner
,
because
dinner
was
ready
.
"
<EOS>
And
mamma
wants
to
see
you
just
for
a
minute
,
"
added
Nina
,
in
a
pretended
whisper
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Nina
,
you
darling
girl
!
"
said
Lucy
,
kissing
her
young
friend
in
an
ecstasy
of
joy
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
all
right
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Nina
in
a
whisper
which
was
really
intended
for
privacy
.
<EOS>
Lucy
did
not
answer
the
question
otherwise
than
by
another
kiss
.
  
<EOS>
Frank
Greystock
was
,
of
course
,
obliged
to
take
his
seat
at
the
table
,
and
was
entertained
with
a
profusion
of
civility
.
<EOS>
Everybody
knew
that
he
had
behaved
badly
to
Lucy
,
 
everybody
,
except
Lucy
herself
,
who
,
from
this
time
forward
,
altogether
forgot
that
she
had
for
some
time
looked
upon
him
as
a
traitor
,
and
had
made
up
her
mind
that
she
had
been
deceived
and
ill
-
used
.
<EOS>
All
the
Fawns
had
spoken
of
him
,
in
Lucy
's
absence
,
in
the
hardest
terms
of
reproach
,
and
declared
that
he
was
not
fit
to
be
spoken
to
by
any
decent
person
.
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
had
known
from
the
first
that
such
a
one
as
he
was
not
to
be
trusted
.
<EOS>
Augusta
had
never
liked
him
.
<EOS>
Amelia
had
feared
that
poor
Lucy
Morris
had
been
unwise
,
and
too
ambitious
.
<EOS>
Georgina
had
seen
that
,
of
course
,
it
would
never
do
.
<EOS>
Diana
had
sworn
that
it
was
a
great
shame
.
<EOS>
Lydia
was
sure
that
Lucy
was
a
great
deal
too
good
for
him
.
<EOS>
Cecilia
had
wondered
where
he
would
go
to
;
 
a
form
of
anathema
which
had
brought
down
a
rebuke
from
her
mother
.
<EOS>
And
Nina
had
always
hated
him
like
poison
.
<EOS>
But
now
nothing
was
too
good
for
him
.
<EOS>
An
unmarried
man
who
is
willing
to
sacrifice
himself
is
,
in
feminine
eyes
,
always
worthy
of
ribbons
and
a
chaplet
.
<EOS>
Among
all
these
Fawns
there
was
as
little
selfishness
as
can
be
found
,
 
even
among
women
.
<EOS>
The
lover
was
not
the
lover
of
one
of
themselves
,
but
of
their
governess
.
<EOS>
And
yet
,
though
he
desired
neither
to
eat
nor
drink
at
that
hour
,
something
special
had
been
cooked
for
him
,
and
a
special
bottle
of
wine
had
been
brought
out
of
the
cellar
.
<EOS>
All
his
sins
were
forgiven
him
.
<EOS>
No
single
question
was
asked
as
to
his
gross
misconduct
during
the
last
six
months
.
<EOS>
No
pledge
or
guarantee
was
demanded
for
the
future
.
<EOS>
There
he
was
,
in
the
guise
of
a
declared
lover
,
and
the
fatted
calf
was
killed
.
  
<EOS>
After
this
early
dinner
it
was
necessary
that
he
should
return
to
town
,
and
Lucy
obtained
leave
to
walk
with
him
to
the
station
.
<EOS>
To
her
thinking
now
,
there
was
no
sin
to
be
forgiven
.
<EOS>
Everything
was
,
and
had
been
,
just
as
it
ought
to
be
.
<EOS>
Had
any
human
being
hinted
that
he
had
sinned
,
she
would
have
defended
him
to
the
death
.
<EOS>
Something
was
said
between
them
about
Lizzie
,
but
nothing
that
arose
from
jealousy
.
<EOS>
Not
till
many
months
had
passed
did
she
tell
him
of
Lizzie
's
message
to
herself
,
and
of
her
visit
to
Hertford
Street
.
<EOS>
But
they
spoke
of
the
necklace
,
and
poor
Lucy
shuddered
as
she
was
told
the
truth
about
those
false
oaths
.
<EOS>
"
I
really
do
think
that
,
after
that
,
Lord
Fawn
is
right
,
"
she
said
,
looking
round
at
her
lover
.
"
<EOS>
Yes
;
but
what
he
did
,
he
did
before
that
,
"
said
Frank
.
<EOS>
"
But
are
they
not
good
and
kind
?
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
pleading
for
her
friends
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Was
ever
anybody
so
well
treated
as
they
have
treated
me
?
<EOS>
I
'll
tell
you
what
,
sir
,
you
must
n't
quarrel
with
Lord
Fawn
any
more
.
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
allow
it
.
<EOS>
"
Then
she
walked
back
from
the
station
alone
,
almost
bewildered
by
her
own
happiness
.
  
<EOS>
That
evening
something
like
an
explanation
was
demanded
by
Lady
Fawn
,
but
no
explanation
was
forthcoming
.
<EOS>
When
questions
were
asked
about
his
silence
,
Lucy
,
half
in
joke
and
half
in
earnest
,
fired
up
and
declared
that
everything
had
been
as
natural
as
possible
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
have
come
to
Lady
Linlithgow
's
house
.
<EOS>
Lady
Linlithgow
would
not
receive
him
.
<EOS>
No
doubt
she
had
been
impatient
,
but
then
that
had
been
her
fault
.
<EOS>
Had
he
not
come
to
her
the
very
first
day
after
her
return
to
Richmond
?
<EOS>
When
Augusta
said
something
as
to
letters
which
might
have
been
written
,
Lucy
snubbed
her
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Who
says
he
did
n't
write
?
<EOS>
He
did
write
.
<EOS>
If
I
am
contented
,
why
should
you
complain
?
"
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
do
n't
complain
,
"
said
Augusta
.
  
<EOS>
Then
questions
were
asked
as
to
the
future
,
 
questions
to
which
Lady
Fawn
had
a
right
to
demand
an
answer
.
<EOS>
What
did
Mr.
Greystock
propose
to
do
now
?
<EOS>
Then
Lucy
broke
down
,
sobbing
,
crying
,
triumphing
,
with
mingled
love
and
happiness
.
<EOS>
She
was
to
go
to
the
deanery
.
<EOS>
Frank
had
brought
with
him
a
little
note
to
her
from
his
mother
,
in
which
she
was
invited
to
make
the
deanery
at
Bobsborough
her
home
for
the
present
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
are
to
go
away
just
when
you
've
come
?
"
asked
Nina
.
  
<EOS>
"
Stay
with
us
a
month
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Lady
Fawn
,
"
just
to
let
people
know
that
we
are
friends
,
and
after
that
the
deanery
will
be
the
best
home
for
you
.
"
<EOS>
And
so
it
was
arranged
.
  
<EOS>
*
<EOS>
*
<EOS>
*
<EOS>
*
<EOS>
*
  
<EOS>
It
need
only
be
further
said
,
in
completing
the
history
of
Lucy
Morris
as
far
as
it
can
be
completed
in
these
pages
,
that
she
did
go
to
the
deanery
,
and
that
there
she
was
received
with
all
the
affection
which
Mrs.
Greystock
could
show
to
an
adopted
daughter
.
<EOS>
Her
quarrel
had
never
been
with
Lucy
personally
,
 
but
with
the
untoward
fact
that
her
son
would
not
marry
money
.
<EOS>
At
the
deanery
she
remained
for
fifteen
happy
months
,
and
then
became
Mrs.
Greystock
,
with
a
bevy
of
Fawn
bridesmaids
around
her
.
<EOS>
As
the
personages
of
a
chronicle
such
as
this
should
all
be
made
to
operate
backwards
and
forwards
on
each
other
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
,
it
would
have
been
desirable
that
the
chronicler
should
have
been
able
to
report
that
the
ceremony
was
celebrated
by
Mr.
Emilius
.
<EOS>
But
as
the
wedding
did
not
take
place
till
the
end
of
the
summer
,
and
as
Mr.
Emilius
at
that
time
never
remained
in
town
,
after
the
season
was
over
,
this
was
impossible
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
Dean
of
Bobsborough
,
assisted
by
one
of
the
minor
canons
,
who
performed
the
service
.
   
<EOS>
The
Trial
 
<EOS>
Having
told
the
tale
of
Lucy
Morris
to
the
end
,
the
chronicler
must
now
go
back
to
the
more
important
persons
of
this
history
.
<EOS>
It
was
still
early
in
April
when
Lizzie
Eustace
was
taken
down
to
Scotland
by
her
cousin
,
and
the
trial
of
Mr.
Benjamin
and
Mr.
Smiler
was
fixed
to
take
place
at
the
Central
Criminal
Court
about
the
middle
of
<EOS>
May.
Early
in
May
the
attorneys
for
the
prosecution
applied
to
Greystock
,
asking
him
whether
he
would
make
arrangements
for
his
cousin
's
appearance
on
the
occasion
,
informing
him
that
she
had
already
been
formally
summoned
.
<EOS>
Whereupon
he
wrote
to
Lizzie
,
telling
her
what
she
had
better
do
,
in
the
kindest
manner
,
 
as
though
there
had
been
no
cessation
of
their
friendly
intercourse
,
offering
to
go
with
her
into
court
,
 
and
naming
an
hotel
at
which
he
would
advise
her
to
stay
during
the
very
short
time
that
she
need
remain
in
London
.
<EOS>
She
answered
this
letter
at
once
.
<EOS>
She
was
sorry
to
say
that
she
was
much
too
ill
to
travel
,
or
even
to
think
of
travelling
.
<EOS>
Such
was
her
present
condition
that
she
doubted
greatly
whether
she
would
ever
again
be
able
to
leave
the
two
rooms
to
which
she
was
at
present
confined
.
<EOS>
All
that
remained
to
her
in
life
was
to
watch
her
own
blue
waves
from
the
casement
of
her
dear
husband
's
castle
,
 
that
casement
at
which
he
had
loved
to
sit
,
and
to
make
herself
happy
in
the
smiles
of
her
child
.
<EOS>
A
few
months
would
see
the
last
of
it
all
,
and
then
,
perhaps
,
they
who
had
trampled
her
to
death
would
feel
some
pangs
of
remorse
as
they
thought
of
her
early
fate
.
<EOS>
She
had
given
her
evidence
once
and
had
told
all
the
truth
,
 
though
she
was
now
aware
that
she
need
not
have
done
so
,
as
she
had
been
defrauded
of
a
vast
amount
of
property
through
the
gross
negligence
of
the
police
.
<EOS>
She
was
advised
now
by
persons
who
seemed
really
to
understand
the
law
,
that
she
could
recover
the
value
of
the
diamonds
which
her
dear
,
dear
husband
had
given
her
,
from
the
freeholders
of
the
parish
in
which
the
robbery
had
taken
place
.
<EOS>
She
feared
that
her
health
did
not
admit
of
the
necessary
exertion
.
<EOS>
Were
it
otherwise
<EOS>
she
would
leave
no
stone
unturned
to
recover
the
value
of
her
property
,
 
not
on
account
of
its
value
,
but
because
she
had
been
so
ill
-
treated
by
Mr.
Camperdown
and
the
police
.
<EOS>
Then
she
added
a
postscript
to
say
that
it
was
quite
out
of
the
question
that
she
should
take
any
journey
for
the
next
six
months
.
  
<EOS>
The
reader
need
hardly
be
told
that
Greystock
did
not
believe
a
word
of
what
she
said
.
<EOS>
He
felt
sure
that
she
was
not
ill
.
<EOS>
There
was
an
energy
in
the
letter
hardly
compatible
with
illness
.
<EOS>
But
he
could
not
make
her
come
.
<EOS>
He
certainly
did
not
intend
to
go
down
again
to
Scotland
to
fetch
her
,
 
and
even
had
he
done
<EOS>
so
he
could
not
have
forced
her
to
accompany
him
.
<EOS>
He
could
only
go
to
the
attorneys
concerned
,
and
read
to
them
so
much
of
the
letter
as
he
thought
fit
to
communicate
to
them
.
<EOS>
"
That
wo
n't
do
at
all
,
"
said
an
old
gentleman
at
the
head
of
the
firm
.
<EOS>
"
She
has
been
very
leniently
treated
,
and
she
must
come
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
manage
it
,
then
,
"
said
Frank
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
she
wo
n't
give
us
trouble
,
because
if
she
does
we
must
expose
her
,
"
said
the
second
member
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
has
not
even
sent
a
medical
certificate
,
"
said
the
tyro
of
the
firm
,
who
was
not
quite
so
sharp
as
he
will
probably
become
when
he
has
been
a
member
of
it
for
ten
or
twelve
years
.
<EOS>
You
should
never
ask
the
ostler
whether
he
greases
his
oats
.
<EOS>
In
this
case
Frank
Greystock
was
not
exactly
in
the
position
of
the
ostler
;
but
he
did
inform
his
cousin
by
letter
that
she
would
lay
herself
open
to
all
manner
of
pains
and
penalties
if
she
disobeyed
such
a
summons
as
she
had
received
,
unless
she
did
so
by
a
very
strong
medical
advice
,
backed
by
a
medical
certificate
.
  
<EOS>
Lizzie
,
when
she
received
this
,
had
two
strings
to
her
bow
.
<EOS>
A
writer
from
Ayr
had
told
her
that
the
summons
sent
to
her
was
not
worth
the
paper
on
which
it
was
printed
in
regard
to
a
resident
in
Scotland
;
 
and
she
had
also
got
a
doctor
from
the
neighbourhood
who
was
satisfied
that
she
was
far
too
ill
to
travel
up
to
London
.
<EOS>
Pulmonary
debilitation
was
the
complaint
from
which
she
was
suffering
,
which
,
with
depressed
vitality
in
all
the
organs
,
and
undue
languor
in
all
the
bodily
functions
,
would
be
enough
to
bring
her
to
a
speedy
end
if
she
so
much
as
thought
of
making
a
journey
up
to
London
.
<EOS>
A
certificate
to
this
effect
was
got
in
triplicate
.
<EOS>
One
copy
she
sent
to
the
attorneys
,
one
to
Frank
,
and
one
she
kept
herself
.
  
<EOS>
The
matter
was
very
pressing
indeed
.
<EOS>
It
was
considered
that
the
trial
could
not
be
postponed
till
the
next
sitting
at
the
Criminal
Court
,
because
certain
witnesses
in
respect
to
the
diamonds
had
been
procured
from
Hamburg
and
Vienna
,
at
a
very
great
cost
;
they
were
actually
on
their
way
to
London
when
Lizzie
's
second
letter
was
received
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Camperdown
had
resolved
to
have
the
diamonds
,
still
with
a
hope
that
they
might
be
restored
to
the
keeping
of
Messrs.
Garnett
,
there
to
lie
hidden
and
unused
at
any
rate
for
the
next
twenty
years
.
<EOS>
The
diamonds
had
been
traced
first
to
Hamburg
,
and
then
to
Vienna
;
 
and
it
was
to
be
proved
that
they
were
now
adorning
the
bosom
of
a
certain
enormously
rich
Russian
princess
.
<EOS>
From
the
grasp
of
the
Russian
princess
it
was
found
impossible
to
rescue
them
;
but
the
witnesses
who
,
as
it
was
hoped
,
might
have
aided
Mr.
Camperdown
in
his
efforts
,
were
to
be
examined
at
the
trial
.
  
<EOS>
A
confidential
clerk
was
sent
down
to
Portray
,
but
the
confidential
clerk
altogether
failed
in
making
his
way
into
Lizzie
's
presence
.
<EOS>
Word
was
brought
to
him
that
nothing
but
force
could
take
Lady
Eustace
from
her
bed
-
chamber
;
and
that
force
used
to
that
effect
might
take
her
out
dead
,
but
certainly
not
alive
.
<EOS>
He
made
inquiry
,
however
,
about
the
doctor
,
and
found
that
he
certainly
was
a
doctor
.
<EOS>
If
a
doctor
will
certify
that
a
lady
is
dying
,
what
can
any
judge
do
,
or
any
jury
?
<EOS>
There
are
certain
statements
which
,
though
they
are
false
as
hell
,
must
be
treated
as
though
they
were
true
as
gospel
.
<EOS>
The
clerk
reported
,
when
he
got
back
to
London
,
that
,
to
his
belief
,
Lady
Eustace
was
enjoying
an
excellent
state
of
health
;
 
but
that
he
was
perfectly
certain
that
she
would
not
appear
as
a
witness
at
the
trial
.
  
<EOS>
The
anger
felt
by
many
persons
as
to
Lizzie
's
fraudulent
obstinacy
was
intense
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Camperdown
thought
that
she
ought
to
be
dragged
up
to
London
by
cart
ropes
.
<EOS>
The
attorneys
engaged
for
the
prosecution
were
almost
beside
themselves
.
<EOS>
They
did
send
down
a
doctor
of
their
own
,
but
Lizzie
would
not
see
the
doctor
,
 
would
not
see
the
doctor
though
threats
of
most
frightful
consequences
were
conveyed
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
would
be
exposed
,
fined
thousands
of
pounds
,
committed
to
gaol
for
contempt
of
court
,
and
prosecuted
for
perjury
into
the
bargain
.
<EOS>
But
she
was
firm
.
<EOS>
She
wrote
one
scrap
of
a
note
to
the
doctor
who
came
from
London
,
"
I
shall
not
live
to
satisfy
their
rabid
vengeance
.
"
<EOS>
Even
Frank
Greystock
felt
almost
more
annoyed
than
gratified
that
she
should
be
able
thus
to
escape
.
<EOS>
People
who
had
heard
of
the
inquiry
before
the
magistrate
,
had
postponed
their
excitement
and
interest
on
the
occasion
,
because
they
knew
that
the
day
of
the
trial
would
be
the
great
day
;
and
when
they
heard
that
they
were
to
be
robbed
of
the
pleasure
of
Lady
Eustace
's
cross
-
examination
,
there
arose
almost
a
public
feeling
of
wrath
that
justice
should
be
thus
outraged
.
<EOS>
The
doctor
who
had
given
the
certificate
was
vilified
in
the
newspapers
,
and
long
articles
were
written
as
to
the
impotence
of
the
law
.
<EOS>
But
Lizzie
was
successful
,
and
the
trial
went
on
without
her
.
  
<EOS>
It
appeared
that
though
her
evidence
was
very
desirable
it
was
not
absolutely
essential
,
as
,
in
consequence
of
her
certified
illness
,
the
statement
which
she
had
made
at
the
police
-
court
could
be
brought
up
and
used
against
the
prisoners
.
<EOS>
All
the
facts
of
the
robbery
were
,
moreover
,
proved
by
Patience
Crabstick
and
Billy
Cann
;
and
the
transfer
of
the
diamonds
by
Mr.
Benjamin
to
the
man
who
recut
them
at
Hamburg
was
also
proved
.
<EOS>
Many
other
morsels
of
collateral
evidence
had
also
been
picked
up
by
the
police
,
 
so
that
there
was
no
possible
doubt
as
to
any
detail
of
the
affair
in
Hertford
Street
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
rumour
that
Mr.
Benjamin
intended
to
plead
guilty
.
<EOS>
He
might
,
perhaps
,
have
done
so
<EOS>
had
it
not
been
for
the
absence
of
Lady
Eustace
;
but
as
that
was
thought
to
give
him
a
possible
chance
of
escape
,
he
stood
his
ground
.
  
<EOS>
Lizzie
's
absence
was
a
great
disappointment
to
the
sight
-
seers
of
London
,
but
nevertheless
the
court
was
crowded
.
<EOS>
It
was
understood
that
the
learned
serjeant
who
was
retained
on
this
occasion
to
defend
Mr.
Benjamin
,
and
who
was
assisted
by
the
acute
gentleman
who
had
appeared
before
the
magistrate
,
would
be
rather
severe
upon
Lady
Eustace
,
even
in
her
absence
;
and
that
he
would
ground
his
demand
for
an
acquittal
on
the
combined
facts
of
her
retention
of
the
diamonds
,
her
perjury
,
and
of
her
obstinate
refusal
to
come
forward
on
the
present
occasion
.
<EOS>
As
it
was
known
that
he
could
be
very
severe
,
many
came
to
hear
him
,
 
<EOS>
and
they
were
not
disappointed
.
<EOS>
The
reader
shall
see
a
portion
of
his
address
to
the
jury
,
 
which
we
hope
may
have
had
some
salutary
effect
on
Lizzie
,
as
she
read
it
in
her
retreat
at
Portray
,
looking
out
upon
her
own
blue
waves
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
now
,
gentlemen
of
the
jury
,
let
me
recapitulate
to
you
the
history
of
this
lady
as
far
as
it
relates
to
the
diamonds
as
to
which
my
client
is
now
in
jeopardy
.
<EOS>
You
have
heard
on
the
testimony
of
Mr.
Camperdown
that
they
were
not
hers
at
all
,
 
that
,
at
any
rate
,
they
were
not
supposed
to
be
hers
by
those
in
whose
hands
was
left
the
administration
of
her
husband
's
estate
,
and
that
when
they
were
first
supposed
to
have
been
stolen
at
the
inn
at
Carlisle
,
he
had
already
commenced
legal
steps
for
the
recovery
of
them
from
her
clutches
.
<EOS>
A
bill
in
Chancery
had
been
filed
because
she
had
obstinately
refused
to
allow
them
to
pass
out
of
her
hands
.
<EOS>
It
has
been
proved
to
you
by
Lord
Fawn
that
though
he
was
engaged
to
marry
her
,
he
broke
his
engagement
because
he
supposed
her
possession
of
these
diamonds
to
be
fraudulent
and
dishonest
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
This
examination
had
been
terrible
to
the
unfortunate
Under
-
Secretary
;
 
and
had
absolutely
driven
him
away
from
the
India
Board
and
from
Parliament
for
a
month
.
<EOS>
"
It
has
been
proved
to
you
that
when
the
diamonds
were
supposed
to
have
vanished
at
Carlisle
,
she
there
committed
perjury
.
<EOS>
That
she
did
so
she
herself
stated
on
oath
in
that
evidence
which
she
gave
before
the
magistrate
when
my
client
was
committed
,
and
which
has
,
as
I
maintain
,
improperly
and
illegally
been
used
against
my
client
at
this
trial
.
<EOS>
"
Here
the
judge
looked
over
his
spectacles
and
admonished
the
learned
serjeant
,
that
his
argument
on
that
subject
had
already
been
heard
,
and
the
matter
decided
.
<EOS>
"
True
,
my
lord
;
but
my
conviction
of
my
duty
to
my
client
compels
me
to
revert
to
it
.
<EOS>
Lady
Eustace
committed
perjury
at
Carlisle
,
having
the
diamonds
in
her
pocket
at
the
very
moment
in
which
she
swore
that
they
had
been
stolen
from
her
.
<EOS>
And
if
justice
had
really
been
done
in
this
case
,
gentlemen
,
it
is
Lady
Eustace
who
should
now
be
on
her
trial
before
you
,
and
not
my
unfortunate
client
.
<EOS>
Well
,
 
what
is
the
next
that
we
hear
of
it
?
<EOS>
It
seems
that
she
brought
the
diamonds
up
to
London
;
but
how
long
she
kept
them
there
,
nobody
knows
.
<EOS>
It
was
,
however
,
necessary
to
account
for
them
.
<EOS>
A
robbery
is
got
up
between
a
young
woman
who
seems
to
have
been
the
confidential
friend
rather
than
the
maid
of
Lady
Eustace
,
and
that
other
witness
whom
you
have
heard
testifying
against
himself
,
and
who
is
,
of
all
the
informers
that
ever
came
into
my
hands
,
the
most
flippant
,
the
most
hardened
,
the
least
conscientious
,
and
the
least
credible
.
<EOS>
That
they
two
were
engaged
in
a
conspiracy
I
can
not
doubt
.
<EOS>
That
Lady
Eustace
was
engaged
with
them
,
I
will
not
say
.
<EOS>
But
I
will
ask
you
to
consider
whether
such
may
not
probably
have
been
the
case
.
<EOS>
At
any
rate
,
she
then
perjures
herself
again
.
<EOS>
She
gives
a
list
of
the
articles
stolen
from
her
,
and
omits
the
diamonds
.
<EOS>
She
either
perjures
herself
a
second
time
,
 
or
else
the
diamonds
,
in
regard
to
which
my
client
is
in
jeopardy
,
were
not
in
the
house
at
all
,
and
could
not
then
have
been
stolen
.
<EOS>
It
may
very
probably
have
been
so
.
<EOS>
Nothing
more
probable
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Camperdown
and
the
managers
of
the
Eustace
estate
had
gradually
come
to
a
belief
that
the
Carlisle
robbery
was
a
hoax
,
 
and
,
therefore
,
another
robbery
is
necessary
to
account
for
the
diamonds
.
<EOS>
Another
robbery
is
arranged
,
and
this
young
and
beautiful
widow
,
as
bold
as
brass
,
again
goes
before
the
magistrate
and
swears
.
<EOS>
Either
the
diamonds
were
not
stolen
,
or
else
again
she
commits
a
second
perjury
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
now
,
gentlemen
,
she
is
not
here
.
<EOS>
She
is
sick
forsooth
at
her
own
castle
in
Scotland
,
and
sends
to
us
a
medical
certificate
.
<EOS>
But
the
gentlemen
who
are
carrying
on
the
prosecution
know
their
witness
,
and
do
n't
believe
a
word
of
her
sickness
.
<EOS>
Had
she
the
feelings
of
woman
in
her
bosom
<EOS>
she
ought
indeed
to
be
sick
unto
death
.
<EOS>
But
they
know
her
better
,
and
send
down
a
doctor
of
their
own
.
<EOS>
You
have
heard
his
evidence
,
 
and
yet
this
wonderful
lady
is
not
before
us
.
<EOS>
I
say
again
that
she
ought
to
be
here
in
that
dock
,
 
in
that
dock
in
spite
of
her
fortune
,
in
that
dock
in
spite
of
her
title
,
in
that
dock
in
spite
of
her
castle
,
her
riches
,
her
beauty
,
and
her
great
relatives
.
<EOS>
A
most
wonderful
woman
,
indeed
,
is
the
widow
Eustace
.
<EOS>
It
is
she
whom
public
opinion
will
convict
as
the
guilty
one
in
this
marvellous
mass
of
conspiracy
and
intrigue
.
<EOS>
In
her
absence
,
and
after
what
she
has
done
herself
,
can
you
convict
any
man
either
of
stealing
or
of
disposing
of
these
diamonds
?
"
<EOS>
The
vigour
,
the
attitude
,
and
the
indignant
tone
of
the
man
were
more
even
than
his
words
;
 
but
,
nevertheless
,
the
jury
did
find
both
Benjamin
and
Smiler
guilty
,
and
the
judge
did
sentence
them
to
penal
servitude
for
fifteen
years
.
  
<EOS>
And
this
was
the
end
of
the
Eustace
<EOS>
diamonds
as
far
as
anything
was
ever
known
of
them
in
England
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Camperdown
altogether
failed
,
even
in
his
attempt
to
buy
them
back
at
something
less
than
their
value
,
and
was
ashamed
himself
to
look
at
the
figures
when
he
found
how
much
money
he
had
wasted
for
his
clients
in
their
pursuit
.
<EOS>
In
discussing
the
matter
afterwards
with
Mr.
Dove
,
he
excused
himself
by
asserting
his
inability
to
see
so
gross
a
robbery
perpetrated
by
a
little
minx
under
his
very
eyes
without
interfering
with
the
plunder
.
<EOS>
"
I
knew
what
she
was
,
"
he
said
,
"
from
the
moment
of
Sir
Florian
's
unfortunate
marriage
.
<EOS>
He
had
brought
a
little
harpy
into
the
family
,
and
I
was
obliged
to
declare
war
against
her
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Dove
seemed
to
be
of
opinion
that
the
ultimate
loss
of
the
diamonds
was
upon
the
whole
desirable
,
as
regarded
the
whole
community
.
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
to
have
had
the
case
settled
as
to
right
of
possession
,
"
he
said
,
"
because
there
were
in
it
one
or
two
points
of
interest
.
<EOS>
We
none
of
us
know
,
for
instance
,
what
a
man
can
,
or
what
a
man
can
not
,
give
away
by
a
mere
word
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
No
such
word
was
ever
spoken
,
"
said
Mr.
Camperdown
in
wrath
.
  
<EOS>
"
Such
evidence
as
there
is
would
have
gone
to
show
that
it
had
been
spoken
.
<EOS>
But
the
very
existence
of
such
property
so
to
be
disposed
of
,
or
so
not
to
be
disposed
of
,
is
in
itself
an
evil
.
<EOS>
Thus
,
we
have
had
to
fight
for
six
months
about
a
lot
of
stones
hardly
so
useful
as
the
flags
in
the
street
,
and
then
they
vanish
from
us
,
leaving
us
nothing
to
repay
us
for
our
labour
.
<EOS>
"
All
which
Mr.
Camperdown
did
not
quite
understand
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Dove
would
be
paid
for
his
labour
,
 
as
to
which
,
however
,
Mr.
Camperdown
knew
well
that
no
human
being
was
more
indifferent
than
Mr.
Dove
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
much
sorrow
,
too
,
among
the
police
.
<EOS>
They
had
no
doubt
succeeded
in
sending
two
scoundrels
out
of
the
social
world
,
probably
for
life
,
and
had
succeeded
in
avoiding
the
reproach
which
a
great
robbery
,
unaccounted
for
,
always
entails
upon
them
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
sad
to
them
that
the
property
should
altogether
have
been
lost
,
and
sad
also
that
they
should
have
been
constrained
to
allow
Billy
Cann
to
escape
out
of
their
hands
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
the
sadness
may
have
been
lessened
to
a
certain
degree
in
the
breast
of
the
great
Mr.
Gager
by
the
charms
and
graces
of
Patience
Crabstick
,
to
whom
he
kept
his
word
by
making
her
his
wife
.
<EOS>
This
fact
,
 
or
rather
the
prospect
of
this
fact
,
as
it
then
was
,
 
had
also
come
to
the
knowledge
of
the
learned
serjeant
,
and
,
in
his
hands
,
had
served
to
add
another
interest
to
the
trial
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Gager
,
when
examined
on
the
subject
,
did
not
attempt
to
deny
the
impeachment
,
and
expressed
a
strong
opinion
that
,
though
Miss
Crabstick
had
given
way
to
temptation
under
the
wiles
of
the
Jew
,
she
would
make
an
honest
and
an
excellent
wife
.
<EOS>
In
which
expectation
let
us
trust
that
he
may
not
be
deceived
.
  
<EOS>
Amusement
had
,
indeed
,
been
expected
from
other
sources
which
failed
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
had
been
summoned
,
and
Lord
George
;
but
both
of
them
had
left
town
before
the
summons
could
reach
them
.
<EOS>
It
was
rumoured
that
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
with
her
niece
,
had
gone
to
join
her
husband
at
New
York
.
<EOS>
At
any
rate
,
she
disappeared
altogether
from
London
,
leaving
behind
her
an
amount
of
debts
which
showed
how
extremely
liberal
in
their
dealings
the
great
tradesmen
of
London
will
occasionally
be
.
<EOS>
There
were
milliners
"
bills
which
had
been
running
for
three
years
,
and
horse
-
dealers
had
given
her
credit
year
after
year
,
though
they
had
scarcely
ever
seen
the
colour
of
her
money
.
<EOS>
One
account
,
however
,
she
had
honestly
settled
.
<EOS>
The
hotel
-
keeper
in
Albemarle
Street
had
been
paid
,
and
all
the
tribute
had
been
packed
and
carried
off
from
the
scene
of
the
proposed
wedding
banquet
.
<EOS>
What
became
of
Lord
George
for
the
next
six
months
,
nobody
ever
knew
;
but
he
appeared
at
Melton
in
the
following
November
,
and
I
do
not
know
that
any
one
dared
to
ask
him
questions
about
the
Eustace
diamonds
.
  
<EOS>
Of
Lizzie
,
and
her
future
career
,
something
further
must
be
said
in
the
concluding
chapters
of
this
work
.
<EOS>
She
has
been
our
heroine
,
and
we
must
see
her
through
her
immediate
troubles
before
we
can
leave
her
;
but
it
may
be
as
well
to
mention
here
,
<EOS>
that
although
many
threats
had
been
uttered
against
her
,
not
only
by
Mr.
Camperdown
and
the
other
attorneys
,
but
even
by
the
judge
himself
,
no
punishment
at
all
was
inflicted
upon
her
in
regard
to
her
recusancy
,
nor
was
any
attempt
made
to
punish
her
.
<EOS>
The
affair
was
over
,
and
men
were
glad
to
avoid
the
necessity
of
troubling
themselves
further
with
the
business
.
<EOS>
It
was
said
that
a
case
would
be
got
up
with
the
view
of
proving
that
she
had
not
been
ill
at
all
,
and
that
the
Scotch
doctor
would
be
subjected
to
the
loss
of
his
degree
,
or
whatever
privileges
in
the
healing
art
belonged
to
him
;
 
but
nothing
was
done
,
and
Lizzie
triumphed
in
her
success
.
   
<EOS>
Once
More
at
Portray
 
<EOS>
On
the
very
day
of
the
trial
<EOS>
Mr.
Emilius
travelled
from
London
to
Kilmarnock
.
<EOS>
The
trial
took
place
on
a
Monday
,
so
that
he
had
at
his
command
an
entire
week
before
he
would
be
required
to
appear
again
in
his
church
.
<EOS>
He
had
watched
the
case
against
Benjamin
and
Smiler
very
closely
,
and
had
known
beforehand
,
almost
with
accuracy
,
what
witnesses
would
appear
and
what
would
not
at
the
great
coming
event
at
the
Old
Bailey
.
<EOS>
When
he
first
heard
of
Lady
Eustace
's
illness
,
he
wrote
to
her
a
most
affectionately
pastoral
letter
,
strongly
adjuring
her
to
think
of
her
health
before
all
things
,
and
assuring
her
that
in
his
opinion
,
and
in
that
of
all
his
friends
,
she
was
quite
right
not
to
come
up
to
London
.
<EOS>
She
wrote
him
a
very
short
but
a
very
gracious
answer
,
thanking
him
for
his
solicitude
,
and
explaining
to
him
that
her
condition
made
it
quite
impossible
that
she
should
leave
Portray
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
suppose
anybody
knows
how
ill
I
am
;
but
it
does
not
matter
.
<EOS>
When
I
am
gone
,
they
will
know
what
they
have
done
.
"
<EOS>
Then
Mr.
Emilius
resolved
that
he
would
go
down
to
Scotland
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
Lady
Eustace
was
not
as
ill
as
she
thought
;
but
it
might
be
that
the
trial
,
and
the
hard
things
lately
said
of
her
,
and
her
loneliness
,
and
the
feeling
that
she
needed
protection
,
might
,
at
such
a
moment
as
this
,
soften
her
heart
.
<EOS>
She
should
know
at
least
that
one
tender
friend
did
not
desert
her
because
of
the
evil
things
which
men
said
of
her
.
  
<EOS>
He
went
to
Kilmarnock
,
thinking
it
better
to
make
his
approaches
by
degrees
.
<EOS>
Were
he
to
present
himself
at
once
at
the
castle
and
be
refused
admittance
,
he
would
hardly
know
how
to
repeat
his
application
or
to
force
himself
upon
her
presence
.
<EOS>
From
Kilmarnock
he
wrote
to
her
,
saying
that
business
connected
with
his
ministrations
during
the
coming
autumn
had
brought
him
into
her
beautiful
neighbourhood
,
and
that
he
could
not
leave
it
without
paying
his
respects
to
her
in
person
.
<EOS>
With
her
permission
he
would
call
upon
her
on
the
Thursday
at
about
noon
.
<EOS>
He
trusted
that
the
state
of
her
health
would
not
prevent
her
from
seeing
him
,
and
reminded
her
that
a
clergyman
was
often
as
welcome
a
visitor
at
the
bedside
of
the
invalid
,
as
the
doctor
or
the
nurse
.
<EOS>
He
gave
her
no
address
,
as
he
rather
wished
to
hinder
her
from
answering
him
,
but
at
the
appointed
hour
he
knocked
at
the
castle
-
door
.
  
<EOS>
Need
it
be
said
that
Lizzie
's
state
of
health
was
not
such
as
to
preclude
her
from
seeing
so
intimate
a
friend
as
Mr.
Emilius
?
<EOS>
That
she
was
right
to
avoid
by
any
effort
the
castigation
which
was
to
have
fallen
upon
her
from
the
tongue
of
the
learned
serjeant
,
the
reader
who
is
not
straight
-
laced
will
be
disposed
to
admit
.
<EOS>
A
lone
woman
,
very
young
,
and
delicately
organised
!
<EOS>
How
could
she
have
stood
up
against
such
treatment
as
was
in
store
for
her
?
<EOS>
And
is
it
not
the
case
that
false
pretexts
against
public
demands
are
always
held
to
be
justifiable
by
the
female
mind
?
<EOS>
What
lady
will
ever
scruple
to
avoid
her
taxes
?
<EOS>
What
woman
ever
understood
her
duty
to
the
State
?
<EOS>
And
this
duty
which
was
required
of
her
was
so
terrible
,
that
it
might
well
have
reduced
to
falsehood
a
stouter
heart
than
her
own
.
<EOS>
It
can
hardly
be
reckoned
among
Lizzie
's
great
sins
that
she
did
not
make
that
journey
up
to
London
.
<EOS>
An
appearance
of
sickness
she
did
maintain
,
even
with
her
own
domestics
.
<EOS>
To
do
as
much
as
that
was
due
even
to
the
doctor
whom
she
had
cajoled
out
of
the
certificate
,
and
who
was
afterwards
frightened
into
maintaining
it
.
<EOS>
But
Mr.
Emilius
was
her
clergyman
,
 
her
own
clergyman
,
as
she
took
care
to
say
to
her
maid
,
 
her
own
clergyman
,
who
had
come
all
the
way
from
London
to
be
present
with
her
in
her
sickness
;
and
of
course
she
would
see
him
.
  
<EOS>
Lizzie
did
not
think
much
of
the
coming
autumnal
ministration
at
Kilmarnock
.
<EOS>
She
knew
very
well
why
Mr.
Emilius
had
undertaken
the
expense
of
a
journey
into
Scotland
in
the
middle
of
the
London
season
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
maimed
fearfully
in
her
late
contests
with
the
world
,
and
was
now
lame
and
soiled
and
impotent
.
<EOS>
The
boy
with
none
of
the
equipments
of
the
skilled
sportsman
can
make
himself
master
of
a
wounded
bird
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Emilius
was
seeking
her
in
the
moment
of
her
weakness
,
fearing
that
all
chance
of
success
might
be
over
for
him
<EOS>
should
she
ever
again
recover
the
full
use
of
her
wings
.
<EOS>
All
this
Lizzie
understood
,
and
was
able
to
measure
Mr.
Emilius
at
his
own
value
of
himself
.
<EOS>
But
then
,
again
,
she
was
forced
to
ask
herself
what
was
her
value
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
terribly
mauled
by
the
fowlers
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
hit
,
so
to
say
,
on
both
wings
,
and
hardly
knew
whether
she
would
ever
again
be
able
to
attempt
a
flight
in
public
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
live
alone
in
Portray
Castle
for
the
rest
of
her
days
.
<EOS>
Ianthe
's
soul
and
the
Corsair
were
not
,
in
truth
,
able
to
console
her
for
the
loss
of
society
.
<EOS>
She
must
have
somebody
to
depend
upon
;
 
ah
,
some
one
whom
,
if
it
were
possible
,
she
might
love
.
<EOS>
She
saw
no
reason
why
she
should
not
love
Mr.
Emilius
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
shockingly
ill
-
treated
by
Lord
Fawn
,
and
the
Corsair
,
and
Frank
Greystock
.
<EOS>
No
woman
had
ever
been
so
knocked
about
in
her
affections
.
<EOS>
She
pitied
herself
with
an
exceeding
pity
when
she
thought
of
all
the
hardships
which
she
had
endured
.
<EOS>
Left
an
early
widow
,
persecuted
by
her
husband
's
family
,
twice
robbed
,
spied
upon
by
her
own
servants
,
unappreciated
by
the
world
at
large
,
ill
-
used
by
three
lovers
,
victimised
by
her
selected
friend
,
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
and
now
driven
out
of
society
because
she
had
lost
her
diamonds
,
was
she
not
more
cruelly
treated
than
any
woman
of
whom
she
had
ever
read
or
heard
?
<EOS>
But
she
was
not
going
to
give
up
the
battle
,
even
now
.
<EOS>
She
still
had
her
income
,
and
she
had
great
faith
in
income
.
<EOS>
And
though
she
knew
that
she
had
been
grievously
wounded
by
the
fowlers
,
she
believed
that
time
would
heal
her
wounds
.
<EOS>
The
world
would
not
continue
to
turn
its
back
altogether
upon
a
woman
with
four
thousand
pounds
a
year
,
because
she
had
told
a
fib
about
her
necklace
.
<EOS>
She
weighed
all
this
;
but
the
conviction
strongest
upon
her
mind
was
the
necessity
that
she
should
have
a
husband
.
<EOS>
She
felt
that
a
woman
by
herself
in
the
world
can
do
nothing
,
and
that
an
unmarried
woman
's
strength
lies
only
in
the
expectation
that
she
may
soon
be
married
.
<EOS>
To
her
it
was
essentially
necessary
that
she
should
have
the
protection
of
a
husband
who
might
endure
on
her
behalf
some
portion
of
those
buffetings
to
which
she
seemed
to
be
especially
doomed
.
<EOS>
Could
she
do
better
with
herself
than
take
Mr.
Emilius
?
  
<EOS>
Might
she
have
chosen
from
all
the
world
,
Mr.
Emilius
was
not
,
perhaps
,
the
man
whom
she
would
have
selected
.
<EOS>
There
were
,
indeed
,
attributes
in
the
man
,
very
objectionable
in
the
sight
of
some
people
,
which
to
her
were
not
specially
disagreeable
.
<EOS>
She
thought
him
rather
good
-
looking
than
otherwise
,
in
spite
of
a
slight
defect
in
his
left
eye
.
<EOS>
His
coal
-
black
,
glossy
hair
commanded
and
obtained
her
admiration
,
and
she
found
his
hooky
nose
to
be
handsome
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
think
much
of
the
ancestral
blood
of
which
he
had
boasted
,
and
hardly
believed
that
he
would
ever
become
a
bishop
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
popular
,
and
with
a
rich
,
titled
wife
,
might
become
more
so
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Emilius
and
Lady
Eustace
would
,
she
thought
,
sound
very
well
,
and
would
surely
make
their
way
in
society
.
<EOS>
The
man
had
a
grasping
ambition
about
him
,
and
a
capacity
,
too
,
which
,
combined
,
would
enable
him
to
preach
himself
into
notoriety
.
<EOS>
And
then
in
marrying
Mr.
Emilius
,
should
she
determine
to
do
so
<EOS>
,
she
might
be
sure
,
almost
sure
,
of
dictating
her
own
terms
as
to
settlement
.
<EOS>
With
Lord
Fawn
,
with
Lord
George
,
or
even
with
her
cousin
Frank
,
there
would
have
been
much
difficulty
.
<EOS>
She
thought
that
with
Mr.
Emilius
she
might
obtain
the
undisputed
command
of
her
own
income
.
<EOS>
But
she
did
not
quite
make
up
her
mind
.
<EOS>
She
would
see
him
and
hear
what
he
had
to
say
.
<EOS>
Her
income
was
her
own
,
and
should
she
refuse
Mr.
Emilius
,
other
suitors
would
no
doubt
come
.
  
<EOS>
She
dressed
herself
with
considerable
care
,
 
having
first
thought
of
receiving
him
in
bed
.
<EOS>
But
as
the
trial
had
now
gone
on
without
her
,
it
would
be
convenient
that
her
recovery
should
be
commenced
.
<EOS>
So
she
had
herself
dressed
in
a
white
morning
wrapper
with
pink
bows
,
and
allowed
the
curl
to
be
made
fit
to
hang
over
her
shoulder
.
<EOS>
And
she
put
on
a
pair
of
pretty
slippers
,
with
gilt
bindings
,
and
took
a
laced
handkerchief
and
a
volume
of
Shelley
,
 
<EOS>
and
so
she
prepared
herself
to
receive
Mr.
Emilius
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
,
since
the
reader
first
knew
her
,
had
begun
to
use
a
little
colouring
in
the
arrangement
of
her
face
,
and
now
,
in
honour
of
her
sickness
,
she
was
very
pale
indeed
.
<EOS>
But
still
,
through
the
paleness
,
there
was
the
faintest
possible
tinge
of
pink
colour
shining
through
the
translucent
pearl
powder
.
<EOS>
Any
one
who
knew
Lizzie
would
be
sure
that
,
when
she
did
paint
,
she
would
paint
well
.
  
<EOS>
The
conversation
was
at
first
,
of
course
,
confined
to
the
lady
's
health
.
<EOS>
She
thought
that
she
was
,
perhaps
,
getting
better
,
though
,
as
the
doctor
had
told
her
,
the
reassuring
symptoms
might
too
probably
only
be
too
fallacious
.
<EOS>
She
could
eat
nothing
,
 
literally
nothing
.
<EOS>
A
few
grapes
out
of
the
hothouse
had
supported
her
for
the
last
week
.
<EOS>
This
statement
was
foolish
on
Lizzie
's
part
,
as
Mr.
Emilius
was
a
man
of
an
inquiring
nature
,
and
there
was
not
a
grape
in
the
garden
.
<EOS>
Her
only
delight
was
in
reading
and
in
her
child
's
society
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
she
thought
that
she
would
pass
away
with
the
boy
in
her
arms
and
her
favourite
volume
of
Shelley
in
her
hand
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Emilius
expressed
a
hope
that
she
would
not
pass
away
yet
,
for
ever
so
many
years
.
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
my
friend
,
"
said
Lizzie
,
"
what
is
life
,
that
one
should
desire
it
?
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Emilius
of
course
reminded
her
that
,
though
her
life
might
be
nothing
to
herself
,
it
was
very
much
indeed
to
those
who
loved
her
.
"
<EOS>
Yes
;
 
to
my
boy
,
"
said
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Emilius
informed
her
,
with
confidence
,
that
it
was
not
only
her
boy
that
loved
her
.
<EOS>
There
were
others
;
 
or
,
at
any
rate
,
one
other
.
<EOS>
She
might
be
sure
of
one
faithful
heart
,
if
she
cared
for
that
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
only
smiled
,
and
threw
from
her
taper
fingers
a
little
paper
pellet
into
the
middle
of
the
room
,
 
probably
with
the
view
of
showing
at
what
value
she
priced
the
heart
of
which
Mr.
Emilius
was
speaking
.
  
<EOS>
The
trial
had
occupied
two
days
,
Monday
and
Tuesday
,
and
this
was
now
the
Wednesday
.
<EOS>
The
result
had
been
telegraphed
to
Mr.
Emilius
,
 
of
course
without
any
record
of
the
serjeant
's
bitter
speech
,
 
and
the
suitor
now
gave
the
news
to
his
lady
-
love
.
<EOS>
Those
two
horrid
men
had
at
last
been
found
guilty
,
and
punished
with
all
the
severity
of
the
law
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Poor
fellows
,
"
said
Lady
Eustace
,
 
"
poor
Mr.
Benjamin
!
<EOS>
Those
ill
-
starred
jewels
have
been
almost
as
unkind
to
him
as
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
'll
never
come
back
alive
,
of
course
,
"
said
Mr.
Emilius
.
<EOS>
"
It
'll
kill
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
it
will
kill
me
too
,
"
said
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
a
something
here
which
tells
me
that
I
shall
never
recover
.
<EOS>
Nobody
will
ever
believe
what
I
have
suffered
about
those
paltry
diamonds
.
<EOS>
But
he
coveted
them
.
<EOS>
I
never
coveted
them
,
Mr.
Emilius
;
though
I
clung
to
them
because
they
were
my
darling
husband
's
last
gift
to
me
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Emilius
assured
her
that
he
quite
understood
the
facts
,
and
appreciated
all
her
feelings
.
  
<EOS>
And
now
,
as
he
thought
,
had
come
the
time
for
pressing
his
suit
.
<EOS>
With
widows
,
he
had
been
told
,
the
wooing
should
be
brisk
.
<EOS>
He
had
already
once
asked
her
to
be
his
wife
,
and
of
course
she
knew
the
motive
of
his
journey
to
Scotland
.
"
<EOS>
Dearest
Lady
Eustace
,
"
he
said
suddenly
,
"
may
I
be
allowed
to
renew
the
petition
which
I
was
once
bold
enough
to
make
to
you
in
London
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Petition
!
"
exclaimed
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
yes
;
I
can
well
understand
that
your
indifference
should
enable
you
to
forget
it
.
<EOS>
Lady
Eustace
,
I
did
venture
to
tell
you
 
that
 
I
loved
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Emilius
,
so
many
men
have
told
me
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
well
believe
it
.
<EOS>
Some
have
told
you
so
,
perhaps
,
from
base
,
mercenary
motives
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
very
complimentary
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
never
pay
you
any
compliments
,
Lady
Eustace
.
<EOS>
Whatever
may
be
our
future
intercourse
in
life
,
you
will
only
hear
words
of
truth
from
my
lips
.
<EOS>
Some
have
told
you
so
from
mercenary
motives
.
"
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Emilius
repeated
the
words
with
severity
,
and
then
paused
to
hear
whether
she
would
dare
to
argue
with
him
.
<EOS>
As
she
was
silent
,
he
changed
his
voice
,
and
went
on
with
that
sweet
,
oily
tone
which
had
made
his
fortune
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Some
,
no
doubt
,
have
spoken
from
the
inner
depths
of
their
hearts
.
<EOS>
But
none
,
Lady
Eustace
,
have
spoken
with
such
adamantine
truth
,
with
so
intense
an
anxiety
,
with
so
personal
a
solicitude
for
your
welfare
in
this
world
and
the
next
,
as
that
,
 
or
I
should
rather
say
those
,
 
which
glow
within
this
bosom
.
<EOS>
"
Lizzie
was
certainly
pleased
by
the
manner
in
which
he
addressed
her
.
<EOS>
She
thought
that
a
man
ought
to
dare
to
speak
out
,
and
that
on
such
an
occasion
as
this
he
should
venture
to
do
so
with
some
enthusiasm
and
some
poetry
.
<EOS>
She
considered
that
men
generally
were
afraid
of
expressing
themselves
,
and
were
as
dumb
as
dogs
from
the
want
of
becoming
spirit
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Emilius
gesticulated
,
and
struck
his
breast
,
and
brought
out
his
words
as
though
he
meant
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
easy
to
say
all
that
,
Mr.
Emilius
,
"
she
replied
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
saying
of
it
is
hard
enough
,
Lady
Eustace
.
<EOS>
You
can
never
know
how
hard
it
is
to
speak
from
a
full
heart
.
<EOS>
But
to
feel
it
,
I
will
not
say
is
easy
;
 
only
to
me
,
not
to
feel
it
is
impossible
.
<EOS>
Lady
Eustace
,
my
heart
is
devoted
to
your
heart
,
and
seeks
its
comrade
.
<EOS>
It
is
sick
with
love
and
will
not
be
stayed
.
<EOS>
It
forces
from
me
words
,
 
words
which
will
return
upon
me
with
all
the
bitterness
of
gall
,
if
they
be
not
accepted
by
you
as
faithful
,
ay
and
of
great
value
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
well
the
value
of
such
a
heart
as
yours
,
Mr.
Emilius
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Accept
it
then
,
dearest
one
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Love
will
not
always
go
by
command
,
Mr.
Emilius
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
indeed
;
 
nor
at
command
will
it
stay
away
.
<EOS>
Do
you
think
I
have
not
tried
that
?
<EOS>
Do
you
believe
that
for
a
man
it
can
be
pleasant
to
be
rebuffed
;
 
that
for
one
who
up
to
this
day
has
always
walked
on
,
triumphant
over
every
obstacle
,
who
has
conquered
every
nay
that
has
obstructed
his
path
,
it
can
have
less
of
bitterness
than
the
bitterness
of
death
to
encounter
a
no
from
the
lips
of
a
woman
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
poor
woman
's
no
should
be
nothing
to
you
,
Mr.
Emilius
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
everything
to
me
,
 
death
,
destruction
,
annihilation
,
 
unless
I
can
overcome
it
.
<EOS>
Darling
of
my
heart
,
queen
of
my
soul
,
empress
presiding
over
the
very
spirit
of
my
being
,
say
,
 
shall
I
overcome
it
now
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
had
never
been
made
love
to
after
this
fashion
before
.
<EOS>
She
knew
,
or
half
knew
,
that
the
man
was
a
scheming
hypocrite
,
craving
her
money
,
and
following
her
in
the
hour
of
her
troubles
,
because
he
might
then
have
the
best
chance
of
success
.
<EOS>
She
had
no
belief
whatever
in
his
love
;
and
yet
she
liked
it
,
and
approved
his
proceedings
.
<EOS>
She
liked
lies
,
thinking
them
to
be
more
beautiful
than
truth
.
<EOS>
To
lie
readily
and
cleverly
,
recklessly
and
yet
successfully
,
was
,
according
to
the
lessons
which
she
had
learned
,
a
necessity
in
woman
and
an
added
grace
in
man
.
<EOS>
There
was
that
wretched
Macnulty
,
who
would
never
lie
;
and
what
was
the
result
?
<EOS>
She
was
unfit
even
for
the
poor
condition
of
life
which
she
pretended
to
fill
.
<EOS>
When
poor
Macnulty
had
heard
that
Mr.
Emilius
was
coming
to
the
castle
,
and
had
not
even
mentioned
her
name
,
and
again
,
when
he
had
been
announced
on
this
very
morning
,
the
unfortunate
woman
had
been
unable
to
control
her
absurd
disappointment
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Emilius
,
"
Lizzie
said
,
throwing
herself
back
upon
her
couch
,
"
you
press
me
very
hard
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
press
you
harder
still
to
gain
the
glory
I
covet
.
"
<EOS>
And
he
made
a
motion
with
his
arms
as
though
he
had
already
got
her
tight
within
his
grasp
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
take
advantage
of
my
illness
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
In
attacking
a
fortress
do
not
the
besiegers
take
all
advantages
?
<EOS>
Dear
Lady
Eustace
,
allow
me
to
return
to
London
with
the
right
of
protecting
your
name
at
this
moment
,
in
which
the
false
and
the
thoughtless
are
attacking
it
.
<EOS>
You
need
a
defender
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
defend
myself
,
sir
,
from
all
attacks
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
that
any
one
can
hurt
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
God
forbid
that
you
should
be
hurt
.
<EOS>
Heaven
forbid
that
even
the
winds
of
heaven
should
blow
too
harshly
on
my
beloved
.
<EOS>
But
my
beloved
is
subject
to
the
malice
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
My
beloved
is
a
flower
all
beautiful
within
and
without
,
but
one
whose
stalk
is
weak
,
whose
petals
are
too
delicate
,
whose
soft
bloom
is
evanescent
.
<EOS>
Let
me
be
the
strong
staff
against
which
my
beloved
may
blow
in
safety
.
"
  
<EOS>
A
vague
idea
came
across
Lizzie
's
mind
that
this
glowing
language
had
a
taste
of
the
Bible
about
it
,
and
that
,
therefore
,
it
was
in
some
degree
impersonal
,
and
intended
to
be
pious
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
relish
piety
at
such
a
crisis
as
this
,
and
was
,
therefore
,
for
a
moment
inclined
to
be
cold
.
<EOS>
But
she
liked
being
called
a
flower
,
and
was
not
quite
sure
whether
she
remembered
her
Bible
rightly
.
<EOS>
The
words
which
struck
her
ear
as
familiar
might
have
come
from
Juan
and
Haidee
,
and
if
so
,
nothing
could
be
more
opportune
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Do
you
expect
me
to
give
you
answer
now
,
Mr.
Emilius
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Yes
,
 
now
.
<EOS>
"
And
he
stood
before
her
in
calm
dignity
,
with
his
arms
crossed
upon
his
breast
.
  
<EOS>
She
did
give
him
his
answer
then
and
there
,
but
first
she
turned
her
face
to
the
wall
,
 
or
rather
to
the
back
of
the
sofa
,
and
burst
into
a
flood
of
tears
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
delicious
moment
to
her
,
that
in
which
she
was
weeping
.
<EOS>
She
sobbed
forth
something
about
her
child
,
something
about
her
sorrows
,
something
as
to
the
wretchedness
of
her
lot
in
life
,
something
of
her
widowed
heart
,
 
something
also
of
that
duty
to
others
which
would
compel
her
to
keep
her
income
in
her
own
hands
;
and
then
she
yielded
herself
to
his
entreaties
.
  
<EOS>
*
<EOS>
*
<EOS>
*
<EOS>
*
<EOS>
*
  
<EOS>
That
evening
she
thought
it
proper
to
tell
Miss
Macnulty
what
had
occurred
.
"
<EOS>
He
is
a
great
preacher
of
the
gospel
,
"
she
said
,
"
and
I
know
no
position
in
the
world
more
worthy
of
a
woman
's
fondest
admiration
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Miss
Macnulty
was
unable
to
answer
a
word
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
congratulate
her
successful
rival
,
even
though
her
bread
depended
on
it
.
<EOS>
She
crept
slowly
out
of
the
room
,
and
went
up
-
stairs
,
and
wept
.
  
<EOS>
Early
in
the
month
of
June
,
Lady
Eustace
was
led
to
the
hymeneal
altar
by
her
clerical
bridegroom
.
<EOS>
The
wedding
took
place
at
the
Episcopal
church
at
Ayr
,
far
from
the
eyes
of
curious
Londoners
.
<EOS>
It
need
only
be
further
said
that
Mr.
Emilius
could
be
persuaded
to
agree
to
no
settlements
prejudicial
to
that
marital
supremacy
which
should
be
attached
to
the
husband
;
and
that
Lizzie
,
when
the
moment
came
,
knowing
that
her
betrothal
had
been
made
public
to
all
the
world
,
did
not
dare
to
recede
from
another
engagement
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
that
Mr.
Emilius
will
suit
her
as
well
as
any
husband
that
she
could
find
,
 
unless
it
shall
be
found
that
his
previous
career
has
been
too
adventurous
.
<EOS>
After
a
certain
fashion
he
will
,
perhaps
,
be
tender
to
her
;
but
he
will
have
his
own
way
in
everything
,
and
be
no
whit
afraid
when
she
is
about
to
die
in
an
agony
of
tears
before
his
eyes
.
<EOS>
The
writer
of
the
present
story
may
,
however
,
declare
that
the
future
fate
of
this
lady
shall
not
be
left
altogether
in
obscurity
.
   
<EOS>
What
Was
Said
About
It
All
at
Matching
 
<EOS>
The
Whitsuntide
holidays
were
late
this
year
,
not
taking
place
till
the
beginning
of
June
,
and
were
protracted
till
the
9th
of
that
month
.
<EOS>
On
the
8th
Lizzie
and
Mr.
Emilius
became
man
and
wife
,
and
on
that
same
day
Lady
Glencora
Palliser
entertained
a
large
company
of
guests
at
Matching
Priory
.
<EOS>
That
the
Duke
of
Omnium
was
there
was
quite
a
matter
of
course
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
in
these
days
Lady
Glencora
seldom
separated
herself
far
,
or
for
any
long
time
,
from
her
husband
's
uncle
,
 
doing
her
duty
to
the
head
of
her
husband
's
family
in
the
most
exemplary
manner
.
<EOS>
People
indeed
said
that
she
watched
him
narrowly
,
but
of
persons
in
high
station
common
people
will
say
anything
.
<EOS>
It
was
at
any
rate
certain
that
she
made
the
declining
years
of
that
great
nobleman
's
life
comfortable
and
decorous
.
<EOS>
Madame
Max
Goesler
was
also
at
Matching
,
a
lady
whose
society
always
gave
gratification
to
the
duke
.
<EOS>
And
Mr.
Palliser
was
also
there
,
taking
the
rest
that
was
so
needful
to
him
;
 
by
which
it
must
be
understood
that
after
having
worked
all
day
,
he
was
able
to
eat
his
dinner
,
and
then
only
write
a
few
letters
before
going
to
bed
,
instead
of
attending
the
House
of
Commons
till
two
or
three
o'clock
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
But
his
mind
was
still
deep
in
quints
and
semitenths
.
<EOS>
His
great
measure
was
even
now
in
committee
.
<EOS>
His
hundred
and
second
clause
had
been
carried
,
with
only
nine
divisions
against
him
of
any
consequence
.
<EOS>
Seven
of
the
most
material
clauses
had
,
no
doubt
,
been
postponed
,
and
the
great
bone
of
contention
as
to
the
two
superfluous
farthings
still
remained
before
him
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
he
fondly
hoped
that
he
would
be
able
to
send
his
bill
complete
to
the
House
of
Lords
before
the
end
of
July
.
<EOS>
What
might
be
done
in
the
way
of
amendments
there
<EOS>
he
had
hitherto
refused
to
consider
.
<EOS>
"
If
the
peers
choose
to
put
themselves
in
opposition
to
the
whole
nation
on
a
purely
commercial
question
,
the
responsibility
of
all
evils
that
may
follow
must
be
at
their
doors
.
<EOS>
"
This
he
had
said
as
a
commoner
.
<EOS>
A
year
or
two
at
the
farthest
,
 
or
more
probably
a
few
months
,
 
would
make
him
a
peer
;
and
then
,
no
doubt
,
he
would
look
at
the
matter
in
a
wholly
different
light
.
<EOS>
But
he
worked
at
his
great
measure
with
a
diligence
which
at
any
rate
deserved
success
;
and
he
now
had
with
him
a
whole
bevy
of
secretaries
,
private
secretaries
,
chief
clerks
,
and
accountants
,
all
of
whom
Lady
Glencora
captivated
by
her
flattering
ways
,
and
laughed
at
behind
their
backs
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bonteen
was
there
with
his
wife
,
repeatedly
declaring
to
all
his
friends
that
England
would
achieve
the
glories
of
decimal
coinage
by
his
blood
and
over
his
grave
,
 
and
Barrington
Erle
,
who
took
things
much
more
easily
,
and
Lord
Chiltern
,
with
his
wife
,
who
would
occasionally
ask
her
if
she
could
explain
to
him
the
value
of
a
quint
,
and
many
others
whom
it
may
not
be
necessary
to
name
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
was
not
there
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
,
whose
health
had
temporarily
given
way
beneath
the
pressing
labours
of
the
India
Board
,
was
visiting
his
estates
in
Tipperary
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
is
married
to
-
day
,
duke
,
down
in
Scotland
,
"
 
said
Lady
Glencora
,
sitting
close
to
the
duke
's
ear
,
for
the
duke
was
a
little
deaf
.
<EOS>
They
were
in
the
duke
's
small
morning
sitting
-
room
,
and
no
one
else
was
present
excepting
<EOS>
Madame
Max
Goesler
.
  
<EOS>
"
Married
to
-
morrow
,
 
down
in
Scotland
.
<EOS>
Dear
,
dear
!
<EOS>
what
is
he
?
"
<EOS>
The
profession
to
which
Mr.
Emilius
belonged
had
been
mentioned
to
the
duke
more
than
once
before
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
's
some
sort
of
a
clergyman
,
duke
.
<EOS>
You
went
and
heard
him
preach
,
Madame
Max
.
<EOS>
You
can
tell
us
what
he
's
like
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
yes
;
he
's
a
clergyman
of
our
church
,
"
said
Madame
Goesler
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
clergyman
of
our
church
;
 
dear
,
dear
.
<EOS>
And
married
in
Scotland
!
<EOS>
That
makes
it
stranger
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
what
made
a
clergyman
marry
her
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Money
,
duke
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
,
speaking
very
loud
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
ah
,
yes
;
money
.
<EOS>
So
he
'd
got
money
;
had
he
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
a
penny
,
duke
;
but
she
had
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
ah
,
yes
.
<EOS>
I
forgot
.
<EOS>
She
was
very
well
left
;
was
n't
she
?
<EOS>
And
so
she
has
married
a
clergyman
without
a
penny
.
<EOS>
Dear
,
dear
!
<EOS>
Did
not
you
say
she
was
very
beautiful
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Lovely
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Let
me
see
,
 
you
went
and
saw
her
,
did
n't
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
went
to
her
twice
,
 
and
got
quite
scolded
about
it
.
<EOS>
Plantagenet
said
that
if
I
wanted
horrors
I
'd
better
go
to
Madame
Tussaud
.
<EOS>
Did
n't
he
,
Madame
Max
?
"
<EOS>
Madame
Max
smiled
and
nodded
her
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
what
's
the
clergyman
like
?
"
asked
the
duke
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
my
dear
,
you
must
take
up
the
running
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
,
dropping
her
voice
.
<EOS>
"
I
ran
after
the
lady
,
but
it
was
you
who
ran
after
the
gentleman
.
<EOS>
"
Then
she
raised
her
voice
.
"
<EOS>
Madame
Max
will
tell
you
all
about
it
,
duke
.
<EOS>
She
knows
him
very
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
him
very
well
;
do
you
?
<EOS>
Dear
,
dear
,
dear
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
him
at
all
,
duke
,
but
I
once
went
to
hear
him
preach
.

He
's
one
of
those
men
who
string
words
together
,
and
do
a
good
deal
of
work
with
a
cambric
pocket
-
handkerchief
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
gentleman
?
"
asked
the
duke
.
  
<EOS>
"
About
as
like
a
gentleman
as
you
're
like
an
archbishop
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
.
  
<EOS>
This
tickled
the
duke
amazingly
.
"
<EOS>
He
,
he
,
he
;
 
I
do
n't
see
why
I
should
n't
be
like
an
archbishop
.
<EOS>
If
I
had
n't
happened
to
be
a
duke
,
I
should
have
liked
to
be
an
archbishop
.
<EOS>
Both
the
archbishops
take
rank
of
me
.
<EOS>
I
never
quite
understood
why
that
was
,
but
they
do
.
<EOS>
And
these
things
never
can
be
altered
when
they
're
once
settled
.
<EOS>
It
's
quite
absurd
,
now
-
a
-
days
,
since
they
've
cut
the
archbishops
down
so
terribly
.
<EOS>
They
were
princes
once
,
I
suppose
,
and
had
great
power
.
<EOS>
But
it
's
quite
absurd
now
,
and
so
they
must
feel
it
.
<EOS>
I
have
often
thought
about
that
a
good
deal
,
Glencora
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
think
about
poor
Mrs.
Arch
,
who
has
n't
got
any
rank
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
great
prelate
having
a
wife
does
seem
to
be
an
absurdity
,
"
said
Madame
Max
,
who
had
passed
some
years
of
her
life
in
a
Catholic
country
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
the
man
is
a
cad
;
 
is
he
?
"
asked
the
duke
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
Bohemian
Jew
,
duke
,
 
an
impostor
who
has
come
over
here
to
make
a
fortune
.
<EOS>
We
hear
that
he
has
a
wife
in
Prague
,
and
probably
two
or
three
elsewhere
.
<EOS>
But
he
has
got
poor
little
Lizzie
Eustace
and
all
her
money
into
his
grasp
,
and
they
who
know
him
say
that
he
's
likely
to
keep
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
,
dear
,
dear
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Barrington
says
that
the
best
spec
he
knows
out
,
for
a
younger
son
,
would
be
to
go
to
Prague
for
the
former
wife
,
and
bring
her
back
with
evidence
of
the
marriage
.
<EOS>
The
poor
little
woman
could
not
fail
of
being
grateful
to
the
hero
who
would
liberate
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
,
dear
,
dear
!
"
said
the
duke
.
"
<EOS>
And
the
diamonds
never
turned
up
after
all
.
<EOS>
I
think
that
was
a
pity
,
because
I
knew
the
late
man
's
father
very
well
.
<EOS>
We
used
to
be
together
a
good
deal
at
one
time
.
<EOS>
He
had
a
fine
property
,
and
we
used
to
live
 
<EOS>
but
I
ca
n't
just
tell
you
how
we
used
to
live
.
<EOS>
He
,
he
,
he
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
had
better
tell
us
nothing
about
it
,
duke
,
"
said
Madame
Max
.
  
<EOS>
The
affairs
of
our
heroine
were
again
discussed
that
evening
in
another
part
of
the
Priory
.
<EOS>
They
were
in
the
billiard
-
room
in
the
evening
,
and
Mr.
Bonteen
was
inveighing
against
the
inadequacy
of
the
law
as
it
had
been
brought
to
bear
against
the
sinners
who
,
between
them
,
had
succeeded
in
making
away
with
the
Eustace
diamonds
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
a
most
unworthy
conclusion
to
such
a
plot
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
It
always
happens
that
they
catch
the
small
fry
,
and
let
the
large
fish
escape
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Whom
did
you
specially
want
to
catch
?
"
asked
Lady
Glencora
.
  
<EOS>
"
Lady
Eustace
,
and
Lord
George
de
Bruce
Carruthers
,
 
as
he
calls
himself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
quite
agree
with
you
,
Mr.
Bonteen
,
that
it
would
be
very
nice
to
send
the
brother
of
a
marquis
to
Botany
Bay
,
or
wherever
they
go
now
;
and
that
it
would
do
a
deal
of
good
to
have
the
widow
of
a
baronet
locked
up
in
the
Penitentiary
;
but
you
see
,
if
they
did
n't
happen
to
be
guilty
,
it
would
be
almost
a
shame
to
punish
them
for
the
sake
of
the
example
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
ought
to
have
been
guilty
,
"
said
Barrington
Erle
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
were
guilty
,
"
protested
Mr.
Bonteen
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
was
enjoying
ten
minutes
of
recreation
before
he
went
back
to
his
letters
.
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
say
that
I
attended
to
the
case
very
closely
,
"
he
observed
,
"
and
perhaps
,
therefore
,
I
am
not
entitled
to
speak
about
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
people
only
spoke
about
what
they
attended
to
,
how
very
little
there
would
be
to
say
,
 
eh
,
Mr.
Bonteen
?
"
<EOS>
This
observation
came
,
of
course
,
from
Lady
Glencora
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
as
far
as
I
could
hear
,
"
continued
Mr.
Palliser
,
"
Lord
George
Carruthers
can
not
possibly
have
had
anything
to
do
with
it
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
stupid
mistake
on
the
part
of
the
police
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
not
quite
so
sure
,
Mr.
Palliser
,
"
said
Bonteen
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
Coldfoot
told
me
so
.
"
<EOS>
Now
Sir
Harry
Coldfoot
was
at
this
time
Secretary
of
State
for
the
Home
affairs
,
and
in
a
matter
of
such
importance
of
course
had
an
opinion
of
his
own
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
all
know
that
he
had
money
dealings
with
Benjamin
,
the
Jew
,
"
said
Mrs.
Bonteen
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
did
n't
he
come
forward
as
a
witness
when
he
was
summoned
?
"
asked
Mr.
Bonteen
triumphantly
.
"
<EOS>
And
as
for
the
woman
,
does
anybody
mean
to
say
that
she
should
not
have
been
indicted
for
perjury
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
woman
,
as
you
are
pleased
to
call
her
,
is
my
particular
friend
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
When
Lady
Glencora
made
any
such
statement
as
this
,
 
and
she
often
did
make
such
statements
,
 
no
one
dared
to
answer
her
.
<EOS>
It
was
understood
that
Lady
Glencora
was
not
to
be
snubbed
,
though
she
was
very
much
given
to
snubbing
others
.
<EOS>
She
had
attained
this
position
for
herself
by
a
mixture
of
beauty
,
rank
,
wealth
,
and
courage
;
 
but
the
courage
had
,
of
the
four
,
been
her
greatest
mainstay
.
  
<EOS>
Then
Lord
Chiltern
,
who
was
playing
billiards
with
Barrington
Erle
,
rapped
his
cue
down
on
the
floor
,
and
made
a
speech
.
<EOS>
"
I
never
was
so
sick
of
anything
in
my
life
as
I
am
of
Lady
Eustace
.
<EOS>
People
have
talked
about
her
now
for
the
last
six
months
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Only
three
months
,
Lord
Chiltern
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
,
in
a
tone
of
rebuke
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
all
that
I
can
hear
of
her
is
,
that
she
has
told
a
lot
of
lies
and
lost
a
necklace
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
When
Lady
Chiltern
loses
a
necklace
worth
ten
thousand
pounds
there
will
be
talk
of
her
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
.
  
<EOS>
At
that
moment
Madame
Max
Goesler
entered
the
room
and
whispered
a
word
to
the
hostess
.
<EOS>
She
had
just
come
from
the
duke
,
who
could
not
bear
the
racket
of
the
billiard
-
room
.
<EOS>
"
Wants
to
go
to
bed
,
does
he
?
<EOS>
Very
well
.
<EOS>
I
'll
go
to
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
seems
to
be
quite
fatigued
with
his
fascination
about
Lady
Eustace
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
call
that
woman
a
perfect
God
-
send
.
<EOS>
What
should
we
have
done
without
her
?
"
<EOS>
This
Lady
Glencora
said
almost
to
herself
as
she
prepared
to
join
the
duke
.
<EOS>
The
duke
had
only
one
more
observation
to
make
before
he
retired
for
the
night
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
afraid
,
you
know
,
that
your
friend
has
n't
what
I
call
a
good
time
before
her
,
Glencora
.
"
  
<EOS>
In
this
opinion
of
the
Duke
of
Omnium
,
the
readers
of
this
story
will
perhaps
agree
.
   
<EOS>
